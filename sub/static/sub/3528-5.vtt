WEBVTT

01:31.133 --> 01:33.760
Have you checked the courts
or the king's chapel?

01:34.678 --> 01:39.307
Majesty, His Grace,
Archbishop Cranmer, is here.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.020
Your Grace.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.314
Your Majesty.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.526
We have had a great success
throughout the whole country...

01:50.694 --> 01:54.030
...in the swearing of allegiance to
Your Majesty as head of the Church.

01:54.198 --> 01:58.034
Also in favour of your marriage
to Queen Anne.

01:59.870 --> 02:04.499
But we cannot persuade either Fisher
or Thomas More to swear the oath.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.168
However, they may swear
to part of it.

02:07.336 --> 02:10.671
Sir Thomas has already told us
he has no argument...

02:10.839 --> 02:13.883
-...with the Act of Succession, and--
-No.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.802
There can be no compromise.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.889
For if we allow them, of all men,
to swear to what they like...

02:20.057 --> 02:23.726
...and not anything else, then they set
a precedent for others to follow.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.147
In this matter, Your Grace,
it is all or nothing.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.400
Majesty.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.739
-Mr. Secretary.
-Majesty.

02:36.907 --> 02:40.743
Dame Alice, the wife
of Sir Thomas More, has written.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.834
She asked to remind you
that her husband...

02:48.001 --> 02:49.752
...has given long and true service...

02:49.920 --> 02:51.712
...and he does nothing
out of malice...

02:51.880 --> 02:54.423
...but only the imperative
of his conscience.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.260
I know all about his conscience.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.054
He's been wearing it on his sleeve
for years.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.765
When he resigned as chancellor,
he made me a promise...

03:02.933 --> 03:07.770
...that he would retire from the world
and live privately and attend his soul.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.064
But this was not true.

03:10.232 --> 03:13.109
He continued to write and publish
pamphlets about my matter...

03:13.277 --> 03:14.485
...and my conscience.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.529
He visited Catherine.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.948
He cajoled others to support her.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.951
In other words,
he broke his promise.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.789
He must accept the consequences.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.918
Majesty.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.884
Sir Thomas, you have visitors.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.970
Thank you.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.432
-Thomas.
-Alice.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.517
Margaret.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.103
Alice.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.652
-Father.
-Look at you.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.613
Well, Thomas More...

03:58.780 --> 04:02.158
...l marvel that you have always
been taken for so wise a man...

04:02.326 --> 04:05.661
...that you will now play the fool here
in this close, filthy prison...

04:05.829 --> 04:09.332
...and be content apparently
to be shut up among mice and rats.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.167
Oh, don't be like that.

04:11.501 --> 04:15.338
I assure you this is one
of the very best rooms in the tower.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.466
In fact...

04:19.092 --> 04:20.176
...formally...

04:20.344 --> 04:23.638
...l am a guest of the constable,
who just brought you here.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.516
And l said to him before that if I ever
showed the least sign of ingratitude...

04:27.684 --> 04:30.186
...for his great generosity,
he should just...

04:30.687 --> 04:33.189
...throw me out of the tower
altogether.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.110
You know why we have come here.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.072
I thought it was to see me.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.699
Yes.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.203
It was to see you.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.040
But beyond that,
it was to ask you to swear the oath...

04:51.208 --> 04:53.709
...so that you could come home
with us.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.171
Alice, tell me one thing.

04:57.589 --> 04:58.965
What is that?

05:00.342 --> 05:02.551
Is not this house as close to heaven
as my own?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.554
Good God, man.
Is that all you can say?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.186
You were always plain-speaking.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.355
It's one of the attributes
I admire you for.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.649
Well, then l shall tell you plainly,
husband...

05:17.150 --> 05:20.569
...that l, and Margaret
and all your other family...

05:20.737 --> 05:23.739
...have all sworn the oath
and feel no worse for it.

05:24.574 --> 05:29.495
And l have always said that l do not
blame any other man or woman...

05:29.663 --> 05:32.915
...who has sworn.
I only say that l myself cannot swear.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.585
Then you are thinking only of yourself.
If you are proceeded against...

05:36.753 --> 05:40.089
...as you know very well,
all your possessions will be forfeited...

05:40.257 --> 05:43.092
...to the crown and we will be forced
into penury.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.054
I have had more sleepless nights over
that issue than over anything else.

05:47.222 --> 05:50.766
-But still you will not swear!
-Alice!

05:51.768 --> 05:54.103
I want you to understand, please.

05:54.271 --> 05:59.108
I do not--
I do not willingly seek martyrdom.

06:00.444 --> 06:07.116
I will do everything l can to
accommodate the king and his desires.

06:09.953 --> 06:14.540
We must remember
that he once made me a promise...

06:15.792 --> 06:20.129
...that he would never force me to do
anything against my conscience...

06:21.423 --> 06:24.050
...to look first unto God...

06:24.301 --> 06:26.218
...and only after unto him.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.473
So, Margaret, don't be sad.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.267
And, Alice...

06:35.062 --> 06:37.313
...say you are not angry with me.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.315
Please.

06:42.778 --> 06:46.322
If you left, and l thought so,
I would feel--

06:47.157 --> 06:49.825
I'd feel even more lonely
than before.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.995
No.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.623
I am not angry with you.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.668
But l am frightened.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.672
So very frightened.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.514
Your Majesty.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.850
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

07:15.310 --> 07:27.822
Your Majesty.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.990
My Lady?

07:30.158 --> 07:32.034
-What is it?
-My Lady?

07:32.202 --> 07:33.828
-Your Majesty.
-My Lady.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.287
What is it?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.039
-Oh, no.
-Your Majesty.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.211
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.213
Get the physician!

08:09.072 --> 08:11.073
I lost the baby.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.577
Yes.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.871
They told me.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.919
We shall make no public
announcement of the fact.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.922
No.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.599
Thank you, Your Majesty.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.240
Stand by.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.077
Mr. Fisher. I came to bring you
two pieces of news.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.249
In the first place,
the pope has made you a cardinal.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.379
But the second is that
Parliament has decreed...

09:07.547 --> 09:10.633
...that to maliciously deny
the king's supremacy in all matters...

09:10.800 --> 09:14.720
...is now a treasonable offence,
punishable by death.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.850
So l ask you again.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.480
Will you accept the king
as the supreme head of the Church...

09:24.648 --> 09:26.273
...and take the oath?

09:26.441 --> 09:29.401
You already know my answer to that.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.158
My agents intercepted this letter.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.162
Its intended recipient
was the emperor.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.582
In it, the writer begs the emperor
to invade England...

09:43.750 --> 09:48.671
...and restore what he is pleased to call
the true queen and the true faith.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.006
Did you write this letter?

09:59.516 --> 10:02.434
In due course, Mr. Fisher...

10:02.811 --> 10:05.521
...you are to be arraigned
for treason...

10:07.941 --> 10:11.652
...and are to be tried
according to His Majesty's pleasure.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.990
Mr. Secretary...

10:16.866 --> 10:20.828
...l must thank you for bringing me
word about my new hat.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.373
At least it was not all bad news.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.636
Cardinal.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.395
Forgive me, ambassador,
for receiving you like this.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.149
I am sad to find Your Majesty
so unwell.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.485
Is it so surprising?

10:54.487 --> 10:58.824
I have received visits
from the Earl of Wiltshire and others...

10:59.909 --> 11:02.244
...trying to make me take the oath...

11:02.412 --> 11:06.415
...and threatening me
when l did not.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.586
Boleyn said that l should be sent
to the scaffold.

11:12.255 --> 11:16.175
I truly believe that man
to be an emissary of Satan.

11:17.594 --> 11:21.221
Tell me, what news
of poor Bishop Fisher?

11:23.016 --> 11:26.769
Parliament has passed
a new Treasons Act...

11:27.896 --> 11:32.107
...which makes malicious denial
of the king's supremacy...

11:32.275 --> 11:34.610
...punishable by death.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.780
Poor Fisher.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.992
He was a lion in my defence.

11:43.286 --> 11:48.791
And now he will die alone
and ashamed in a prison cell.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.967
What caused it?

12:02.305 --> 12:03.639
There was nothing.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.226
Of course there was something.
What did you do to kill the baby?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.936
I didn't.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.313
I don't know.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.316
Believe me, Father, l was so careful.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.818
Well, not careful enough.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.618
Well...

12:25.453 --> 12:27.496
...from now on
we must all be careful...

12:28.790 --> 12:30.833
...you especially...

12:31.626 --> 12:34.044
...not to lose the king's love.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.506
Or everything is lost.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.050
Everything.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.136
For all of us.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.494
Charles, I want to ask you
a question.

13:09.539 --> 13:13.375
Have any of the women you've bedded
ever lied about their virginity?

13:13.543 --> 13:14.960
Their virginity?

13:15.128 --> 13:18.714
I'd say it's the other way around.
Did any of them not lie about it?

13:18.882 --> 13:20.549
Why do you ask?

13:25.180 --> 13:27.347
I ask Your Majesty's forgiveness.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.475
It doesn't matter.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.394
I asked for the truth
and you told me so.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.694
What's this?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.154
Dismount your horse!

13:42.405 --> 13:43.614
Dismount now!

13:45.742 --> 13:47.034
Down!

13:54.876 --> 13:56.210
Good morrow.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.669
Good morrow, Your Majesty.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.713
What's your name?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.925
William Webbe, Your Majesty.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.178
No, your sweetheart's name.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.848
Bess, Your Majesty.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.437
Come here, Bess.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.112
I assure Your Majesty...

14:24.280 --> 14:29.451
...l have a permit and permission
to ride through Your Majesty's forest.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.454
I swear it, and could easily prove it.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.414
Hello, Bess.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.125
Your Majesty.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.641
Come with me.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.103
Form up!

15:13.663 --> 15:16.248
Are you really the King of England?

15:17.166 --> 15:20.919
No, I was only pulling your leg.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.765
Our English friend writes...

15:34.350 --> 15:38.437
...that the Lady is not to have
a child after all.

15:39.105 --> 15:43.692
He also says that the king
has already been unfaithful to her.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.777
"But all this may mean nothing...

15:45.945 --> 15:49.698
...considering the changeable
character of the king...

15:49.866 --> 15:56.330
...and the craft of the Lady,
who well knows how to manage him."

15:57.040 --> 16:02.210
You and I, Campeggio, have done well
to avoid the craft of women.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.380
Celibacy is an immense relief.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.549
Yes, Holy Father.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.551
But our friend is still fearful...

16:09.719 --> 16:12.387
...for the lives of Queen Catherine
and her daughter...

16:12.555 --> 16:16.558
...neither of whom is safe as long
as the concubine has power.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.228
I will have prayers said
for our dear sisters...

16:20.396 --> 16:22.522
...and also for Cardinal Fisher.

16:22.690 --> 16:26.818
May God grant him the courage
to endure his tribulations.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.655
-Yes, Holy Father.
-On the other hand....

16:29.822 --> 16:30.906
Yes?

16:31.866 --> 16:36.244
On the other hand, in the days
of the founders of our church...

16:36.412 --> 16:38.914
...it was considered a privilege
to be martyred...

16:39.082 --> 16:42.084
...like Saint Peter
and the other apostles.

16:42.251 --> 16:46.838
Our church was founded
upon the blood of these martyrs.

16:47.006 --> 16:53.261
So perhaps it is a pity that you and l,
Campeggio, unlike Cardinal Fisher...

16:53.429 --> 16:59.184
...no longer have the opportunity
to die for Christ.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.948
Sir Thomas.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.451
Yes, l'm here.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.793
I'm here. Who are you?

17:24.961 --> 17:26.128
John.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.798
A servant to Bishop Fisher,
who is kept below here.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.592
He asks you to be of good cheer.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.095
How is he?

17:35.263 --> 17:38.473
Truth be told, sir,
he is old and not well.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.226
He cannot eat the food here.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.813
But his spirit remains
ever unbroken.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.649
I'm glad to hear it.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.652
Not in the least bit surprised.

17:52.989 --> 17:56.658
He asks if you would ever contemplate
taking the oath...

17:56.868 --> 17:59.786
...and under what circumstances?

18:00.621 --> 18:03.623
Tell him that I cannot take the oath...

18:04.125 --> 18:07.502
...without damning my soul
for all eternity.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.172
And that l will not do.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.382
Thank you, sir, for that.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.510
I know it will renew
my master's courage.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.513
Now I must go.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.767
God bless you.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.819
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell...

18:32.987 --> 18:36.364
...does Sir Thomas More still continue
in his stubbornness?

18:36.699 --> 18:37.699
Yes.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.868
You will force him
to give his reasons...

18:40.036 --> 18:43.622
...or l will deem his silence
on the matter to be malicious.

18:44.540 --> 18:48.126
I am appointing you vice regent
in spiritual matters.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.545
It's true you are a layman
and not a churchman...

18:50.713 --> 18:54.800
...but in this matter I could not trust
the prejudices of any churchman.

19:28.251 --> 19:31.169
My Lady, your sister has come.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.264
Sister.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.266
Mary.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.560
Your Majesty.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.437
You are with child.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.440
How has it happened?
We knew nothing.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.194
I'm married.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.280
Married?

19:59.115 --> 20:00.949
So...

20:01.617 --> 20:02.868
...who is your husband?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.787
His name is Mr. William Stafford.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.750
I haven't heard of him.
Is he at court?

20:12.003 --> 20:13.628
He....

20:14.589 --> 20:18.133
William is a man of little standing
and no fortune.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.303
He is now a serving soldier
in Calais.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.148
Then you think him...

20:33.316 --> 20:37.611
...worthy to be the husband
of the queen of England's sister?

20:37.778 --> 20:41.907
-Yes, Father. Since l love him and--
-You are very much mistaken.

20:43.492 --> 20:48.538
You married him in secret
and without asking our approval.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.834
He is such a nothing we could never
have given our permission.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.961
If you were to meet him
you would see...

20:55.129 --> 20:57.839
...that he is a good, fine,
honest man.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.467
Since you acted brazenly
and in spite of me, Mary...

21:00.801 --> 21:02.844
...l shall cut off your allowance.

21:03.012 --> 21:07.182
You and your fine,
honest young man can rot in hell...

21:07.350 --> 21:09.517
...as far as l am concerned.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.981
Anne.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.694
How easy do you think it was for me
to find a proper husband...

21:19.862 --> 21:22.822
...when I was called
the great prostitute?

21:22.990 --> 21:26.868
Indeed, l think myself fortunate to have
found William and to be loved by him.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.120
You did not ask my permission.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.539
Do I have to ask your permission
to fall in love?

21:31.707 --> 21:33.124
Yes!

21:34.877 --> 21:36.878
Now we are royalty.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.589
Everything is different.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.725
Please.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.562
Please...

21:55.064 --> 21:56.690
...sister.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.988
No. No.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.412
You and your husband
are banished from court.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.683
Your Honour.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.689
Mr. Cromwell...

22:38.274 --> 22:39.941
...how may l please you?

22:42.778 --> 22:46.740
It would please me very much
if you could give me the reason...

22:46.907 --> 22:49.951
...or reasons
why you will not take the oath.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.956
I have discharged my mind
of all such matters...

22:55.166 --> 22:59.794
...and will no more dispute
kings' titles, nor popes'.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.801
The king accuses you
of stubbornness and obstinacy...

23:06.969 --> 23:09.304
...for not giving your reasons.

23:11.307 --> 23:14.059
You must have some view
of the statute.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.268
I have this view...

23:15.436 --> 23:19.981
...that the Act of Parliament
is like a double-edged sword...

23:20.191 --> 23:23.818
...for if a man answer one way
it confounds his body...

23:24.278 --> 23:28.406
...and if he answers another,
it confounds his soul.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.993
But if you do not answer at all,
you will incur penalties.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.496
His Majesty has commanded me...

23:34.663 --> 23:36.831
...to draw up
an act of attainder against you.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.959
This will make your
imprisonment permanent.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.296
Poor Alice.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.091
Sir Thomas.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.594
Why will you not take the oath?
Thousands have.

23:51.430 --> 23:55.183
Many, l'm sure,
share your beliefs and your faith.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.478
And yet, not your scruples.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.732
Well, as for that,
some may do it for favour...

24:03.692 --> 24:05.735
...and some for fear.

24:06.529 --> 24:09.364
Some may perhaps think
they can later repent and be shriven...

24:09.532 --> 24:11.866
...and that God will forgive them.

24:14.036 --> 24:18.373
And others may be of a mind that if
they say one thing but think another...

24:18.541 --> 24:22.710
...then their oath goes upon what
they think and not upon what they say.

24:25.506 --> 24:29.050
But l cannot use such ways
in so great a matter.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.973
In which case...

24:36.058 --> 24:39.769
...and in all honesty, Sir Thomas...

24:42.398 --> 24:45.650
...you are likely to pay
the ultimate price.

24:50.739 --> 24:54.075
Mr. Cromwell, there really
is no difference between us...

24:54.243 --> 24:56.911
...except that l shall die today...

24:58.289 --> 24:59.873
...and you tomorrow.

25:20.936 --> 25:25.440
Forgive me, but aren't you
Margaret More, Sir Thomas' daughter?

25:25.608 --> 25:27.275
Yes, sir.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.820
I am Eustace Chapuys,
the emperor's ambassador.

25:31.906 --> 25:35.825
It is a great pleasure for me to meet
anyone associated with Thomas More.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.869
Thank you, Your Excellency.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.954
May I ask why you have come
to court?

25:40.414 --> 25:43.791
I have come to petition
Mr. Secretary Cromwell.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.794
Lately most of our lands
have been sold off...

25:46.962 --> 25:49.714
...and my family
is gradually reduced to poverty.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.383
Things go very hard with my mother.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.719
I am sorry to hear it.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.805
I am sorry for many things
that are occurring in this kingdom.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.976
The good seem to suffer,
and the wicked to prosper.

26:05.648 --> 26:08.650
-Oh, Mark.
-Majesty?

26:08.943 --> 26:11.819
You're a free spirit. l love that.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.246
Everyone else constrains me.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.789
No one understands.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.794
Never leave me.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.212
Sister?

27:15.134 --> 27:18.344
I couldn't sleep. l'm sorry.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.054
Why could you not sleep?

27:21.015 --> 27:23.182
For thinking of her.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.395
Who? Thinking of who?

27:29.064 --> 27:31.733
The Lady Mary, of course.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.318
And her mother.

27:35.571 --> 27:36.863
Catherine?

27:37.031 --> 27:40.575
Yes, Catherine.
What's wrong with you?

27:42.077 --> 27:43.745
I don't understand.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.581
-What harm can they do you now?
-Every harm!

27:47.374 --> 27:50.084
As long as Mary is alive...

27:50.252 --> 27:51.586
...she could be queen.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.881
No. No, no.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.383
The Act of Succession
makes it impossible.

27:57.885 --> 28:01.095
Elizabeth, your daughter...

28:01.263 --> 28:03.264
...will be made heir to the throne.

28:03.432 --> 28:06.559
But the king can change his mind.

28:06.727 --> 28:09.103
He can do whatever he wills now.

28:09.271 --> 28:13.483
He has absolute power.
You know that.

28:15.486 --> 28:18.780
And what he has given,
he can take away.

28:18.947 --> 28:22.116
And what taken away,
he can give back.

28:22.284 --> 28:28.706
And he could still make Mary queen,
even above my daughter.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.584
But why should he?

28:32.961 --> 28:35.963
I don't know, l just fear it.

28:43.472 --> 28:46.099
This is all l know of Mary.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.645
That she is my death...

28:51.814 --> 28:54.315
...and l am hers.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.457
Sir Thomas.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.793
-Sir Thomas.
-John?

29:17.172 --> 29:18.840
Is that you, John?

29:19.007 --> 29:21.175
My master, Cardinal Fisher,
was found guilty...

29:21.343 --> 29:23.636
...and is called forth tomorrow.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.681
He hopes you and he
shall soon meet in heaven.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.267
Tell him that will be the way...

29:30.060 --> 29:33.104
...for it is a very strait gate
we are in.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.357
John.

29:37.443 --> 29:43.156
Tell him he deserves
and will receive all of heaven's graces.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.784
Yes, sir. God bless you, sir.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.467
God bless you.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.517
Amen.

30:13.353 --> 30:17.064
You see that I am wearing
my finest clothes...

30:17.232 --> 30:19.901
...for today is my wedding day.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.906
Good people,
I ask you to love the king...

30:25.115 --> 30:29.243
...and obey him,
for he is good by nature...

30:29.411 --> 30:33.498
...even if he is not right
in his religious policies.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.834
But l am condemned to die...

30:37.002 --> 30:41.422
...for wishing to uphold
the honour of God and the Holy See.

30:43.592 --> 30:47.720
And now, good Christian people,
I ask you for your prayers.

30:48.889 --> 30:52.642
I am only flesh, and fear death
as much as any man.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.105
It's true that l long since
made up my mind to die...

30:58.273 --> 31:01.442
...if need be,
for Christ and his Church...

31:02.444 --> 31:05.071
...but now that the moment
is at hand...

31:09.701 --> 31:11.786
...l need your help.

31:12.454 --> 31:18.209
God bless you, Cardinal Fisher.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.545
God bless you, cardinal!

31:20.712 --> 31:23.130
Peace be with you!

31:37.145 --> 31:38.646
Bless you, Cardinal Fisher.

31:38.814 --> 31:42.149
-God bless you!
-God bless you, cardinal!

31:42.317 --> 31:43.776
God bless you.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.001
Not like that, asshole!

32:01.712 --> 32:04.255
Moses looks like a pile of crap.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.519
Holy Father.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.438
Do you know who that was?

32:20.981 --> 32:22.231
No.

32:22.816 --> 32:29.196
Michelagniolo di Ludovico
di Lionardo di Buonarotti Simoni.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.283
Michelangelo? That was him?

32:32.451 --> 32:33.826
That was him.

32:33.994 --> 32:37.246
We forgive him
because he is a genius.

32:37.748 --> 32:38.956
Whatever that means.

32:40.042 --> 32:44.211
Holiness, we have heard from England
of the murder of Cardinal Fisher.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.673
His head was struck
from his body with an axe.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.134
I have already heard.
It is an outrage.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.054
I had made Fisher
a prince of the Church...

32:53.221 --> 32:55.222
...but it mattered nothing
to King Henry...

32:55.390 --> 32:59.226
...who is now so mired
in vice and lust...

32:59.394 --> 33:02.313
...that he is beyond reason.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.741
Majesty, now that Fisher is dead...

33:13.909 --> 33:16.494
...what is to be done about More?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.588
We should press ahead,
Mr. Cromwell.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.840
We should press ahead.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.603
Father, what has happened here?

33:42.938 --> 33:45.731
It seems to me that they are
treating you worse than before.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.444
Well, they've taken my stove...

33:50.904 --> 33:52.947
...some clothing.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.283
My food is reduced.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.828
-Father, how can you--?
-Margaret.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.790
You must not be concerned
about me.

34:06.294 --> 34:12.633
I've thought long and hard
about Christ's passion and pain.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.096
And l'm not afraid of death.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.058
I'm only afraid of torture.

34:22.477 --> 34:26.147
If they use violent ways
to make me swear...

34:27.149 --> 34:29.442
...l don't know how brave l would be.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.319
But you do not have to
suffer anything.

34:33.488 --> 34:37.992
Just take the oath, like l did.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.077
Like everyone has done.

34:40.245 --> 34:43.456
Just say it
and your body will be saved.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.999
But the saving of my body...

34:45.167 --> 34:47.501
-...will be at the expense of my soul.
-No.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.171
-Yes.
-No.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.506
None of us believes that.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.270
Father, please.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.773
Please.

35:10.150 --> 35:13.360
For the love l know you bear us...

35:13.779 --> 35:16.197
...don't do this to us.

35:21.161 --> 35:23.037
Mr. Secretary.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.039
Sir Richard Rich.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.376
Sir Richard.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.338
I'm very pleased to see you.

35:32.714 --> 35:36.717
I have a job for you.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.070
Why?

35:57.322 --> 36:00.241
Why can he not be like others?

36:00.408 --> 36:01.909
Why does he have to cross me?

36:02.077 --> 36:05.037
Why can his vanity be greater
than a king's?

36:06.957 --> 36:08.749
It troubles me.

36:09.334 --> 36:13.420
It weighs on my conscience and
my heart is full and heavy and sore.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.592
I say this only to you.
I confess only to you.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.470
I love him.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.097
And l hate him.

36:24.057 --> 36:28.519
I hate in equal measure to my love,
for he is the spirit that denies.

36:30.188 --> 36:34.233
It is up to you to judge whether or not
he be on my conscience.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.616
Sir Richard.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.743
Good day to you.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.998
I see my cell is fast becoming
the place for lawyers to meet.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.086
I am afraid, Thomas, that I come here
most unwillingly, for l am ordered...

36:54.254 --> 36:58.591
...to deprive you of all your books
and papers and suchlike.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.263
That is a pity.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.603
Still, if you are ordered to,
I suppose....

37:11.313 --> 37:12.980
I suppose there is no other way.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.904
You'd best get started.

37:42.052 --> 37:43.844
May I ask you a question, Thomas?

37:44.012 --> 37:46.305
Only if it's a hypothetical one,
Richard.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.766
It's better that way.

37:48.934 --> 37:53.354
Suppose, then,
that Parliament enacted a bill...

37:53.521 --> 37:56.023
...to say that I, Richard Rich,
was king...

37:56.191 --> 37:58.525
...and that it would be treason
to deny it.

37:59.319 --> 38:01.028
Would you accept me as king?

38:01.196 --> 38:02.655
Yes.

38:04.491 --> 38:07.952
But let me counter
with another hypothetical case.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.871
Suppose Parliament enacted...

38:11.331 --> 38:13.666
...that God was not God...

38:14.542 --> 38:17.544
...and that to oppose the act
would be treason.

38:17.712 --> 38:21.382
Would you say
that God was not God?

38:21.549 --> 38:24.343
No. Since no Parliament
can make any such law.

38:24.511 --> 38:28.222
It has no competence to decide
on the existence of God.

38:28.556 --> 38:33.018
And no more can Parliament make
the king supreme head of the Church.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.733
There, Thomas.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.528
I think my work here is done.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.422
Your Majesty...

39:01.756 --> 39:03.632
...the king is here.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.268
My Lady.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.614
Come here.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.206
Do you still have a passion for me?

39:37.459 --> 39:39.668
I do, sweetheart.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.962
I love you.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.800
There, now.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.803
Don't weep.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.765
Don't weep, my own darling.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.809
It's all right.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.605
Everything is going to be all right.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.009
Sir Thomas.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.769
It's treason.

40:46.736 --> 40:50.030
Sir Thomas More, you are arraigned
before this commission...

40:50.240 --> 40:52.825
...on charges of high treason.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.202
How do you answer the charges?

41:00.041 --> 41:02.668
Let me begin by denying...

41:02.836 --> 41:06.380
...that l ever maliciously opposed
the king's marriage to Anne Boleyn.

41:07.215 --> 41:10.050
I have never spoken maliciously
against it...

41:11.052 --> 41:17.683
...only sometimes according to my
mind, opinion and my conscience...

41:18.685 --> 41:21.395
...and l have suffered as a result.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.149
But you have maliciously denied
the Act of Supremacy.

41:25.775 --> 41:28.068
No, I've been silent upon it.

41:28.987 --> 41:32.114
For all my taciturnity, neither your law
nor any law in the world...

41:32.282 --> 41:35.325
...is able justly and rightly
to condemn me...

41:35.910 --> 41:40.914
...unless you may also lay to my charge
either some word or some deed.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.710
Your silence can easily be construed
as an action.

41:45.420 --> 41:48.922
But even in that case, the presumption
that silence gives consent...

41:49.090 --> 41:50.799
...precludes the charge against me.

41:59.267 --> 42:02.853
What of the charge that you conspired
in prison with Bishop Fisher...

42:03.521 --> 42:05.898
...a convicted traitor?

42:06.065 --> 42:07.941
I never met him in prison.

42:08.109 --> 42:14.072
I only talked a little with his servant
about familiar things.

42:14.449 --> 42:19.286
And recommendations, such as were
seemly to our long acquaintance.

42:28.129 --> 42:32.466
We go back to your supposed silence
on the Act of Supremacy.

42:32.634 --> 42:35.928
We think you have in fact
spoken about it.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.429
And we have a witness.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.264
Call the solicitor general.

42:39.641 --> 42:43.227
Call Mr. Richard Rich.

43:01.329 --> 43:04.998
Richard, you are under oath.
Do you tell this commission...

43:05.166 --> 43:08.835
...truthfully, what the accused
said to you on this matter?

43:09.003 --> 43:10.671
Yes, sir.

43:10.838 --> 43:12.464
We agreed that Parliament...

43:12.632 --> 43:15.676
...might not make any such law
that God was not God.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.679
To which Sir Thomas said:

43:18.972 --> 43:23.308
"No more can Parliament make
the king supreme head of the Church."

43:23.685 --> 43:26.687
So he maliciously denied
the king's authority?

43:27.188 --> 43:28.355
In those words?

43:28.815 --> 43:30.357
Yes, sir.

43:30.858 --> 43:31.984
In those exact words.

43:44.622 --> 43:49.626
Then l will charge this commission
to return a true verdict.

43:49.794 --> 43:52.713
I ask you, good sirs, to determine
whether Sir Thomas More...

43:52.880 --> 43:58.010
...did converse with Sir Richard Rich
in the manner alleged.

44:01.222 --> 44:04.474
You do so find him guilty.

44:08.062 --> 44:11.398
Then l will proceed in judgement
against the prisoner.

44:11.858 --> 44:13.567
My Lord.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.737
My Lord, when l was a lawyer...

44:16.904 --> 44:20.324
...the convention was to ask the
prisoner before judgement was given...

44:20.491 --> 44:22.909
...why judgement
should not be given against him.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.956
What, then, are you able to say
to the contrary?

44:28.833 --> 44:29.916
Thank you.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.089
To my view...

44:37.091 --> 44:41.762
...this indictment is grounded
upon an Act of Parliament...

44:41.929 --> 44:46.224
...directly repugnant to the laws of God
and his Holy Church...

44:47.352 --> 44:49.269
...the supreme governance of which...

44:49.479 --> 44:54.608
...no temporal prince may presume
by any law to take unto himself.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.027
It belongs--

44:57.195 --> 45:03.617
It belongs by right to the see of Rome,
to Saint Peter and his successors...

45:03.785 --> 45:06.953
...as our Saviour told us himself
when he was here on earth.

45:08.915 --> 45:13.627
This realm, this realm being
but one small part of the Church...

45:14.128 --> 45:16.296
...cannot make any particular law...

45:16.464 --> 45:21.593
...disagreeable to the general laws
of Christ's universal Catholic Church.

45:22.011 --> 45:23.929
No more--

45:24.722 --> 45:28.308
No more can this realm of England
refuse obedience to Rome...

45:28.476 --> 45:33.730
...than can a child refuse obedience
to his own natural father.

45:36.150 --> 45:39.736
We now plainly see
that you are maliciously bent.

45:39.904 --> 45:42.989
No, sirs! Not maliciously!

45:43.324 --> 45:47.244
I hope we may all meet merrily
in heaven hereafter.

45:47.412 --> 45:51.581
And l desire Almighty God to preserve
and defend the king's majesty...

45:52.834 --> 45:56.336
...and to send him good counsel.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.924
Sir Thomas More...

46:01.300 --> 46:03.176
...you are to be drawn on a hurdle...

46:04.178 --> 46:07.139
...through the City of London
to Tyburn...

46:07.515 --> 46:11.184
...there to be hanged
till you be half dead.

46:11.519 --> 46:13.186
After that...

46:13.354 --> 46:15.188
...cut down alive...

46:15.356 --> 46:19.526
...your bowels to be taken out
of your body and burned before you...

46:19.694 --> 46:22.362
...your privy parts cut off...

46:22.697 --> 46:25.157
...your head cut off...

46:25.700 --> 46:29.369
...your body to be divided
in four parts.

46:32.582 --> 46:34.207
Thomas!

46:36.544 --> 46:39.212
Father. Bless us, Father.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.339
I bless you, my children.

46:41.507 --> 46:47.053
Be of good cheer, for I pray
that we shall meet together in heaven.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.889
Father!

46:51.225 --> 46:54.394
-Father!
-No.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.404
When is the execution?

47:04.614 --> 47:06.740
Tomorrow, Your Majesty.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.078
What date is that?

47:13.414 --> 47:16.333
The 6th of July.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.005
What time?

47:23.257 --> 47:26.051
At 1 0 in the morning.

47:51.577 --> 47:53.954
That's absolutely hilarious.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.664
Terrible.

48:03.297 --> 48:06.091
I've decided to commute
the sentence to beheading.

48:06.259 --> 48:08.301
Tell the officials.

48:10.221 --> 48:12.597
Yes, Your Majesty.

48:53.848 --> 48:55.515
Amen.

49:45.858 --> 49:47.734
Thank you, Sir Humphrey.

49:48.402 --> 49:51.529
But when l come down again...

49:51.697 --> 49:54.908
...let me shift for myself,
as well as l can.

50:18.933 --> 50:21.601
I ask you to bear witness with me...

50:22.395 --> 50:25.689
...that l shall now suffer death...

50:25.856 --> 50:29.442
...in and for the faith
of the Holy Catholic Church.

50:35.116 --> 50:37.367
I beg you earnestly...

50:37.618 --> 50:39.619
...to pray for the king...

50:39.912 --> 50:41.454
...and tell him...

50:42.456 --> 50:45.125
...l died his good servant...

50:46.043 --> 50:47.585
...but God's first.

50:52.925 --> 50:54.801
I ask for your pardon and blessing.

50:58.139 --> 51:01.057
You give me this day a greater
benefit than any mortal man...

51:01.225 --> 51:03.476
...can ever be able to give me.

51:05.563 --> 51:08.064
Pluck up your spirits, man.

51:08.983 --> 51:11.109
Be not afraid to do your office.

51:11.610 --> 51:14.821
-Bless you, Sir Thomas!
-God be with you!
