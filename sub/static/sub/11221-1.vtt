00:12.646 --> 00:16.648
This is Angela chen
reporting live from the site
of a massive battle

00:16.650 --> 00:19.952
between the justice league
and a group of what can
only be described

00:19.954 --> 00:23.655
as super-villains
calling themselves
the legion of doom.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.925
Reports state that earlier,
the legion launched
a surprise attack

00:26.927 --> 00:29.828
on the league at the unveiling
of their new headquarters,

00:29.830 --> 00:33.699
dubbed by many
on social media as
"the hall of justice."

01:02.430 --> 01:05.397
Is this any way to treat
your guests, superman?

01:05.399 --> 01:08.600
Seeing as how you
crashed the party,
I'd consider us even.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.569
Oh!

01:38.899 --> 01:40.466
What happened,
toymaster?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.101
Did mama kick you
out of the basement?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.202
Hmph.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.249
Grundy smash!

02:18.305 --> 02:22.074
Grundy sleep now.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.945
Robin, report.
How's crowd control?

02:28.415 --> 02:30.182
Huh?

02:35.489 --> 02:39.725
Well at hand, father.
As predicted, they respond
like contemptible sheep.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.695
Surrender, cheetah.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.998
This doesn't have
to end in violence.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.746
Aah!

03:12.860 --> 03:14.860
You're smarter
than this, Luthor.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.432
Your kind attracts their kind.

03:20.434 --> 03:24.169
I'm simply
an innocent industrialist
caught in the middle.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.571
I'll bet.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.515
You'll pay for this.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.250
Knowing you, it's insured.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.799
Huh?

03:55.536 --> 03:57.102
Beep, beep.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.637
Huh?

04:07.147 --> 04:08.347
Not in the face.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.682
Whatever you say.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.260
Playtime's over, toymaster.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.929
But I enjoy
a good game.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.065
And I always win.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.757
Good work, team.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.026
Too bad shazam and lantern
had to miss the fun.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.994
Yeah. Slackers.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.735
We got a runner.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.407
Aah!

05:14.315 --> 05:16.682
Come on, wizard,
don't make me hit you again.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.886
Uh, wiz?

05:20.888 --> 05:23.388
Azarath calls,

05:23.390 --> 05:26.758
the child must answer.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.228
The hour of his rising
is at hand.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.363
Oh, boy.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.732
I've got this.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.414
Hmm. What the hell
did he hit me with?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.117
Himself, apparently.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.358
He's not using any tech.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.826
It's magic.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.701
Argh!

06:15.175 --> 06:16.675
Get them to safety.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.210
I'll keep him distracted.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.322
Argh!

06:32.259 --> 06:33.792
Argh!

06:39.266 --> 06:42.401
Robin, get all civilians
inside, do you read me?

06:42.403 --> 06:45.103
I have a more efficient way
to keep them safe, father.

06:45.105 --> 06:48.573
<i> Robin?</i>
<i> Robin, I gave you a task.</i>

06:48.575 --> 06:52.878
Yes, as a human cattle prod.
I'm being under-utilized.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.548
<i> What's your location?</i>

06:56.550 --> 06:58.417
Where I need to be.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.085
In the driver's seat.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.587
Between the missile
and fuel cell detonations,

07:02.589 --> 07:05.090
I'd estimate at least
a three kiloton hit.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.428
Target locked.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.962
Damian, stand down.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.498
Too late now.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.426
Stand down!

07:44.364 --> 07:47.265
The lasso compels you
to obey my command!

07:56.844 --> 07:57.943
What happened?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.277
He doesn't know.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.248
I thought that would knock
the fight out of him.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.987
What? We got him, didn't we?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.590
What we have is an empty shell
with no answers.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.993
If you had followed orders
and done what you're told,
we'd know more.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.595
Come on,
cut him some slack.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.029
At least, he was trying to...

08:20.634 --> 08:22.501
Not that I disagree.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.904
You buried me
in a worthless position
to keep me out of the way.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.106
And I solved
the entire problem.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.608
This isn't about you.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.076
It's about teamwork.

08:31.078 --> 08:34.379
All I see is a lot
of ineffectual grandstanding.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.648
Which is why I prefer
to work alone.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.583
And my dad
thinks I'm difficult.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.087
Have you ever considered
boarding school?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.016
I could've driven myself.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.817
After the stunt you pulled?

09:12.819 --> 09:15.620
You're lucky to be allowed
within 10 feet
of a steering wheel.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.192
So, this is my punishment?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.428
Enduring a bunch
of school children?

09:23.430 --> 09:25.330
This is not punishment.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.599
Hopefully, you'll learn
to be a part of a team.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.802
And they're not children.
They're teenagers.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.404
Worse.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.073
Don't tell me
Damian Wayne is afraid
of a little socializing.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.876
I'm not afraid of anything.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.344
Teammates are a liability.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.812
Really?

09:40.814 --> 09:42.347
Then what am I to you?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.550
An unavoidable irritation.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.496
You were having
a nightmare last night.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.498
I was just wondering
if everything's...

10:33.500 --> 10:36.901
Look, I appreciate
your concern, I guess.
But they're dreams.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.403
Just dreams.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.711
You know you're naked, right?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.046
Huh?

10:48.448 --> 10:50.148
Aah!

10:50.150 --> 10:52.317
I overslept. Was rushing.

10:52.319 --> 10:56.554
Forgot to put on my uniform.
Okay? So I sleep in the nude.
So what?

10:57.124 --> 10:59.157
Animals are naked.

10:59.159 --> 11:03.294
I'm the entire animal kingdom
crammed into a single
magnificent specimen.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.196
You're something crammed
into something.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.300
What did that thing just say?

11:09.302 --> 11:11.069
It was just laughing at you.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.804
Yeah, well, butt out, bug.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.641
Yow! Keep that thing
on a leash, man!

11:16.643 --> 11:18.443
I told you, don't annoy it.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.213
Jaime's right.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.382
That scarab is not a pet.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.384
It may be fused
to Jaime's spine,

11:26.386 --> 11:29.821
but it's not exactly
under his control.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.189
It's like you and your pants.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.325
That's why Jaime's here.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.227
That's why we're all here.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.630
To help each other
control our gifts.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.965
Help one another
become our best selves.

11:40.967 --> 11:44.769
Where else are we gonna go?
I mean, we're a bunch
of freaks, right?

11:44.771 --> 11:48.640
Come on, Jaime,
we're all family.
Like the three amigos.

11:48.642 --> 11:49.841
Four.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.109
Five.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.579
We're getting a visitor.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.619
Try not to behead anyone.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.227
-Nightwing.
-Starfire.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.230
It's been awhile.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.132
I know.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.467
You're looking good.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.869
This is Damian.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.571
The new Robin.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.772
Welcome, Damian.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.745
I'll be in my room.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.080
-Would you like to...
-I think I can manage.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.751
That is one creepy <i> mocoso.</i>

12:32.753 --> 12:35.687
No, more like sad.

12:40.594 --> 12:44.963
Yeah, I was thinking a movie
might be nice.
Just you and me.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.631
No men in tights.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.799
That sounds nice.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.268
By the way, I bought
some new glasses.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.670
You might not recognize me.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.405
I'm sure I'll be able
to pick you out

12:54.407 --> 12:56.040
no matter what you're wearing.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.575
See you soon.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.323
Hello?

13:29.142 --> 13:32.477
If this is a prank,
you're screwing
with the wrong guy.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.675
Hah!

14:07.013 --> 14:09.848
He hasn't stopped
for an hour and a half.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.485
Damian, it's time
to let others have their turn.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.523
I'm not finished.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.624
Hah!

14:23.763 --> 14:25.864
Gee, how'd that happen?

14:30.270 --> 14:31.369
What the hell?

14:31.371 --> 14:34.105
Hmph, I heard your tech
was fast.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.140
I wanted to see how fast.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.243
Don't mess with us,
little man.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.311
All right.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.581
I can see we are getting off
on the wrong foot.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.784
Damian, this is a team effort.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.287
We need to be willing
to accommodate others.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.556
Nightwing said
you were a Princess.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.025
Exiled, no doubt.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.628
Technically, it was a coup.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.831
And like it or not,
i am the leader
of this group.

14:59.833 --> 15:03.167
As I see it, you're an alien
with nowhere else to go.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.103
Everyone needs a home, Damian.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.404
You included.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.840
Thank you for chiming in,
witch girl.

15:08.842 --> 15:12.277
We are only here
to help you realize
your potential.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.778
You've been here long enough.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.980
When do you think
you'll realize yours?

15:18.218 --> 15:21.219
Dude, you need
to show some respect.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.488
- Argh!

15:25.759 --> 15:26.958
Oh, no.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.364
Ready when you are.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.535
No, stop this.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.239
Hah!

15:44.911 --> 15:47.879
Who's fighting me,
you or the bug?

15:47.881 --> 15:49.280
You'd better hope it's me.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.999
That's the difference
between you and me.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.634
You wear a weapon.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.769
I am a weapon.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.340
No!

16:16.209 --> 16:17.675
Aah!

16:22.816 --> 16:24.015
Enough!

16:25.885 --> 16:27.652
I tried to stop it.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.458
<i> Dios mio.</i> Is he dead?

16:35.428 --> 16:37.996
He's still alive. Barely.

16:37.998 --> 16:41.199
This is going to be
an awkward call to Batman.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.533
Everyone get back.

16:44.637 --> 16:48.539
By the powers of azarath,
i beseech you.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.609
Azarath, metrion, zinthos.

17:02.989 --> 17:05.156
We need to get her
back to her room.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.523
Garfield?

17:07.627 --> 17:08.893
I've got her.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.832
What... what happened?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.568
Raven healed you.
We have to tend to her.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.371
Sorry.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.414
I knew you'd be here
working all night.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.948
Thought you might be hungry.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.885
No, thanks.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.119
Suit yourself.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.958
Where does all that food go
if you don't have a stomach?

17:41.961 --> 17:43.428
You don't wanna know.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.296
What are you up to?

17:45.298 --> 17:47.298
I've been combing
through footage from
every camera on the grid.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.366
And?

17:48.368 --> 17:50.068
There's something odd.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.837
Dark spots.
They're hard to make out.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.708
Activate quadrant
pixel enhancement.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.083
Show-off.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.821
What is that? A shadow?

18:09.823 --> 18:12.223
No, the sun direction
is wrong.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.026
And look here,
it's disconnected
from the surface.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.962
It's mimicking a shadow.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.363
It has intelligence.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.766
It's wandering,
like it's looking
for something.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.469
Or someone.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.971
There's where weather wizard
ran into it.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.539
More like stepped in it.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.041
You don't think
it was after him.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.843
No.

18:31.845 --> 18:32.977
I don't.

18:38.585 --> 18:42.186
Don't get me wrong,
i love catching up
on popular culture

18:42.188 --> 18:45.456
but the harsh language
was entirely unnecessary,

18:45.458 --> 18:49.327
and the female lead seemed
to only be present in order
to be rescued

18:49.329 --> 18:50.962
by the leading man.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.030
But all in all,
i found myself
reasonably diverted.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.001
Clark?

18:58.905 --> 19:01.839
<i> Trigon lives.</i>

19:04.944 --> 19:07.512
--Are you all right?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.113
Sorry, it's just...

19:10.383 --> 19:12.150
I've got a lot on my mind
right now.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.619
You can always share
your burdens with me, Clark.

19:18.091 --> 19:20.224
Ugh, stay away from me.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.676
Hey!

19:38.678 --> 19:40.511
What is wrong with you?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.780
That is
very dangerous.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.082
You could put out an eye
with that thing.

19:45.084 --> 19:48.085
Didn't your mother tell you
never to play with knives?

19:48.087 --> 19:50.087
By the powers
of azarath,

19:50.089 --> 19:51.722
I beseech you.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.624
Mother spirit
of the nether realm,

19:53.626 --> 19:55.593
protect my
brothers and sister.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.763
And give me strength
to face the dark force
i fear is coming.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.611
I suppose I should thank you
for healing me.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.482
Um, you're welcome.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.718
It was strange
having you in my head.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.287
I felt you prying
into my entire life.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.256
It was not appreciated.

20:25.258 --> 20:28.526
I'm an empath, and if it
makes you feel any better,

20:28.528 --> 20:30.328
I didn't see it
as much as felt it.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.496
And I've been trying
to shake it off ever since.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.933
Then you know
I'm not meant to be here
at this stupid school.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.169
I was groomed
for a higher calling.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.203
My grandfather's...

20:39.205 --> 20:40.771
I know all about
your grandfather.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.541
I felt him. He was a demon.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.611
And believe me,
i know my demons.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.946
He was a great man.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.083
We were going to make
the world stronger, better.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.685
We were going
to rule it together.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.754
I know all about
that game, too.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.791
Now, I don't mean to be rude,
but would you mind getting
the hell away from me?

21:04.430 --> 21:08.866
You know, when you were
in my head, I could see things
about you, too.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.769
-Like what?
-It looked like a man.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.238
But something more.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.707
Who... what was that thing?

21:16.709 --> 21:19.610
It was nothing, a nightmare.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.913
It was real, I could tell.

21:22.915 --> 21:26.017
It's none of your business.
Who are you to judge my life?

21:26.019 --> 21:27.885
You have other things
to fix here.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.787
Just stay away from me, okay?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.595
Steady...

21:39.632 --> 21:42.033
Ah. Argh!

21:42.035 --> 21:45.536
Can you please do that
anywhere else?

21:45.538 --> 21:46.837
Jaime?

21:48.374 --> 21:50.875
Yeah?

21:50.877 --> 21:53.477
Perhaps it was a mistake
to challenge you this morning
without knowing

21:53.479 --> 21:58.182
the full capacity
of your alien attachment.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.985
I promise you,
it won't happen again.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.725
Did he just say he's sorry?

22:08.394 --> 22:11.062
Aw, see. He likes you.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.253
<i> Trigon lives.</i>

22:56.843 --> 22:58.943
Atomic skull.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.911
We had quite a tumble
last year.

23:00.913 --> 23:05.449
Still, I sensed you,
being a good guy and all,
playing nice.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.586
You won't have to this time.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.021
I've gotten
a lot, lot, stronger.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.293
You don't look so good.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.144
Okay, okay.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.367
He's barely alive, Clark,
what's wrong with you?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.372
He's not himself.

24:01.374 --> 24:02.773
What is that?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.074
Kryptonite.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.111
Guess he doesn't
tell you everything.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.483
The rising is coming.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.152
You cannot stop it.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.790
Superman, someone
is controlling you.

24:20.626 --> 24:24.128
You have your part to play.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.663
Both of you.

24:25.665 --> 24:29.433
The girl will be taken.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.102
Girl?

24:35.775 --> 24:37.174
Diana, wait!

24:37.176 --> 24:39.477
-We cannot let him...
-I've alerted Trevor.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.379
With any luck,
military satellites
are tracking him now.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.948
And what will we do?

24:43.950 --> 24:45.850
Wait for him to...

24:45.852 --> 24:47.818
Pull the moon
from the sky?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.354
No, we'll get...

24:50.356 --> 24:53.457
He hasn't said anything
about doing something
like that, has he?

24:53.860 --> 24:55.793
No, but...

24:55.795 --> 24:59.196
We're both targets
and for all we know,
so is the rest of the league.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.800
Get back to that island
of yours

25:02.802 --> 25:05.436
and lock yourself
in the darkest, deepest tomb
you can find.

25:05.438 --> 25:06.804
I'll call.

25:06.806 --> 25:09.106
But Clark and I are...

25:09.108 --> 25:11.976
You can't expect me to hide.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.844
Was worth a shot.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.630
What are you doing in my room?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.565
We have rules, Damian.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.702
You never trespass
another person's space.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.705
You have nothing on her.
No background, no history.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.873
On who?

25:42.875 --> 25:44.074
Raven.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.743
You're the leader
of this group.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.144
You should know everything
about her.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.679
It's called "vetting."

25:48.681 --> 25:50.014
She's 14.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.849
No mother, no father.

25:51.851 --> 25:55.185
She grew up
in a hostile realm,
not unlike my own planet.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.755
And she escaped, like I did.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.691
We didn't know anything
about raven
when we took her in

26:00.693 --> 26:02.726
except that she needed a home.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.962
A place to grow.

26:04.964 --> 26:09.533
I was taught that knowledge
was power and you knew
nothing about her.

26:09.535 --> 26:12.603
How much do you have to know
when people are in need?

26:12.605 --> 26:16.840
Garfield was 11
when his genetics kicked in
and gave him green skin

26:16.842 --> 26:18.542
and powers.

26:18.544 --> 26:20.644
We still don't know
the purpose of Jaime's
alien armor

26:20.646 --> 26:22.713
or all of its abilities.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.915
We just knew they needed help.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.484
You have to have
a little faith sometimes.

26:27.486 --> 26:30.588
Faith is belief
based on an absence of data.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.289
It invites disaster.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.764
You have no idea
how frustrating it is.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.267
He reminds me of my sister.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.036
<i> I told you he was tough.</i>
<i> Never had a childhood.</i>

26:46.038 --> 26:49.640
<i> Doesn't know how to act</i>
<i> with kids or anyone else</i>
<i> for that matter.</i>

26:49.642 --> 26:51.575
It's affecting everybody.

26:51.577 --> 26:54.578
<i> Well, you can't expect him</i>
<i> to be great at bonding.</i>

26:54.580 --> 26:57.548
<i> Spent most of his life</i>
<i> training to kill.</i>

26:57.550 --> 26:59.750
<i> Then moves in</i>
<i> with the big bad bat,</i>

26:59.752 --> 27:02.419
<i> which I can tell you</i>
<i> from personal experience,</i>
<i> is not exactly fun.</i>

27:03.889 --> 27:06.190
So you've told me.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.564
<i> Speaking of fun,</i>

27:13.566 --> 27:15.165
<i> the old room looks great.</i>

27:15.167 --> 27:16.834
<i> You know, kori,</i>
<i> you and I could just...</i>

27:16.836 --> 27:19.269
- Fun.
<i> -What?</i>

27:19.271 --> 27:21.672
That's it,
that's what we need.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.173
<i> What who needs?</i>

27:23.175 --> 27:25.242
Oh, you're so smart.
Thanks, dick.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.378
<i> But kori, I don't...</i>

27:28.848 --> 27:30.180
Fun.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.522
I wondered
when you'd get back.

27:38.524 --> 27:39.790
They lost superman.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.525
Fifty-five miles
off the coast.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.161
Flash is checking the area,
he just disappeared.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.398
Where the hell is he going?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.600
You have my feed
from the Batmobile?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.305
Yeah.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.408
That's messed up.

27:57.410 --> 28:00.077
The entity was strong enough
to possess a Kryptonian.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.680
It can't stay in the host
if the host is damaged.

28:02.682 --> 28:07.217
If I'd poisoned superman
with a bigger dose,
i might have saved him.

28:07.219 --> 28:11.221
Scour the net,
narrow your search results
to superman sightings

28:11.223 --> 28:13.257
and to recent
supernatural events.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.592
Supernatural?

28:16.062 --> 28:18.562
Yes. Subsection:

28:18.564 --> 28:19.630
Female.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.646
Aah! Dude, did you have
to bring the sword?

29:09.648 --> 29:12.216
Preparedness is a prerequisite
for victory.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.351
The gear stays
in the car, Damian.

29:14.353 --> 29:18.222
Tonight we are to enjoy
some mandatory fun.

29:29.769 --> 29:34.238
This is an opportunity for us
to become more familiar
with each other.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.240
How much more
familiar can we get?

29:36.242 --> 29:38.709
We've already seen
Garfield lick himself.

29:38.711 --> 29:40.744
-As a dog?
-I wish.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.611
Just call me "eagle eyes."

30:44.143 --> 30:45.409
What?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.646
Huh?

31:44.670 --> 31:46.236
Here, have some.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.108
That tastes like pure sugar.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.777
Boy, were you
up in those mountains
a long time.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.282
It was a joke,
I'm not criticizing.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.284
I knew it was a joke.

32:00.286 --> 32:03.220
And if you knew me,
you wouldn't waste
your time trying.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.824
I guess neither of
our lives are very funny.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.627
But I'll tell you something
about yourself that
not even you know.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.230
You may be insufferable,

32:13.232 --> 32:16.500
but in your heart,
you are a kind
and generous soul.

32:49.735 --> 32:50.801
Booyah!

32:53.072 --> 32:56.006
Oh, looks like we found
something the bug can't do.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.443
Please, please, no autographs.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.478
I'm a busy man.

33:05.384 --> 33:08.251
Free popcorn to anyone
who can slay the beast.

33:08.253 --> 33:10.220
I can do it.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.922
You know how to dance?

33:11.924 --> 33:13.457
I'm a quick study.

33:19.031 --> 33:21.565
Hmm, all right.

33:26.939 --> 33:28.605
Hope you're a good loser.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.451
<i> Dance!</i>

34:41.346 --> 34:43.045
<i> Mira.</i> Look at them go.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.984
<i> Raven...</i>

34:51.090 --> 34:52.889
<i> They're waiting for you.</i>

35:04.136 --> 35:06.903
<i> On the hill,</i>
<i> beyond the tent.</i>

35:31.029 --> 35:32.829
Sister...

35:37.970 --> 35:40.103
He wants you.

35:41.206 --> 35:44.374
We've missed you, sister.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.477
It can't be him, it's a trick.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.479
<i> It is me, child.</i>

35:52.151 --> 35:53.517
How?

35:53.519 --> 35:56.786
<i> Never leave unfinished</i>
<i> what you start.</i>

35:56.788 --> 35:59.022
<i> -You fled.</i>
-I left.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.090
I had you.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.860
<i> Yet, here I am.</i>

36:05.430 --> 36:08.165
If you were really here,
I'd smell your stink.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.833
You're still trapped.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.968
All you can send
are these losers.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.554
<i> I will be there.</i>

36:14.555 --> 36:17.139
<i> It's our destiny</i>
<i> to be together,</i>
<i> raven, always.</i>

36:17.976 --> 36:19.543
<i> We're family.</i>

36:19.545 --> 36:21.711
<i> You can make that happen.</i>

36:21.713 --> 36:24.114
<i> You can bring me.</i>

36:24.116 --> 36:25.916
I will fight you every step.

36:25.918 --> 36:29.886
-You're an abomination.
<i> -Watch your talk,</i>
<i> ungrateful girl.</i>

36:37.095 --> 36:38.762
<i> Look at yourself.</i>

36:38.764 --> 36:41.064
<i> -Weak, lonely.</i>

36:41.066 --> 36:42.432
<i> Aligning with chattel.</i>

36:42.434 --> 36:46.770
<i> It is beneath my contempt</i>
<i> and I will not have it.</i>

36:46.772 --> 36:48.638
<i> You will be a part of</i>
<i> this, child.</i>

36:48.640 --> 36:52.509
<i> You will know</i>
<i> the glory of trigon.</i>

36:52.511 --> 36:53.877
Argh!

36:55.414 --> 36:57.948
Mother of azarath,
give me strength.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.702
You cannot last.
You're temporal agents.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.904
We will last long enough.

37:23.875 --> 37:24.941
Aah!

37:26.478 --> 37:27.744
He wants you.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.146
He will have you.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.718
Awesome, dude.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.920
Yes, quite impressive.

38:12.024 --> 38:14.424
You were
very good too, Garfield.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.693
Yeah, okay.

38:18.030 --> 38:18.995
Whatever.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.502
Ugh!

38:27.172 --> 38:29.773
Raven! Titans, go!

39:16.355 --> 39:19.222
They're demonic emissaries.
My father sent them.

39:19.224 --> 39:20.290
Your father?

39:24.963 --> 39:26.363
Damn it.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.630
Argh!

40:13.445 --> 40:16.212
Please tell me they're undead.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.815
Yes, but you can't stop them
like that.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.083
They're like batteries.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.692
Then let's run them down.

40:34.499 --> 40:35.765
Argh!

40:37.169 --> 40:38.334
Aah!

40:39.571 --> 40:41.838
Argh!

40:54.586 --> 40:55.985
Argh!

42:10.896 --> 42:14.597
Whoo, yeah, we kicked
demon boot-ay.

42:14.599 --> 42:15.865
Yeah, baby.

42:16.268 --> 42:17.333
Up top.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.502
Hit me.

42:21.439 --> 42:22.505
Hmm.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.519
Robin said I didn't know
enough about you.

42:36.521 --> 42:38.288
I think he was right.

42:38.290 --> 42:40.990
You told me
you didn't have a father.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.560
What I said is that
he's gone.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.194
That's not the same as dead.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.462
He's dead to me.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.333
So, why is he
trying to kill you?

42:52.437 --> 42:54.037
He's not trying to kill me.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.306
It's much worse.

43:12.891 --> 43:16.025
Safe to say we're not in
Kansas anymore.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.828
It's no star field
i recognize.

43:19.431 --> 43:20.997
Where are we?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.900
Somewhere my father
can't see us.

43:24.669 --> 43:26.869
All right, let's hear it.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.238
There's so much.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.140
I guess it starts with my mom.

43:36.381 --> 43:39.515
<i> She was young, rebellious</i>
<i> and gullible.</i>

43:39.517 --> 43:41.818
<i> Of course she wound up</i>
<i> in a cult.</i>

43:42.220 --> 43:43.753
<i> Anyway,</i>

43:43.755 --> 43:45.888
<i> they decided to do</i>
<i> the classic bride of</i>
<i> Satan rite.</i>

43:45.890 --> 43:48.992
<i> And guess who got</i>
<i> to be the lucky bride?</i>

43:48.994 --> 43:51.294
<i> I doubt anyone</i>
<i> expected it to work,</i>

43:51.296 --> 43:53.930
<i> but the ancient ceremony</i>
<i> turned out to be</i>
<i> the real thing.</i>

44:15.820 --> 44:17.120
<i> So, mom,</i>

44:17.122 --> 44:19.122
<i> with her great powers</i>
<i> of judgment,</i>

44:19.124 --> 44:22.025
<i> didn't hesitate to hook up</i>
<i> with the guy who emerged</i>
<i> from the smoke.</i>

44:33.405 --> 44:34.971
<i> Whoa, whoa,</i>
<i> whoa, wait.</i>

44:34.973 --> 44:37.306
So, your mom
did it with Satan?

44:37.308 --> 44:40.610
His name is trigon,
but basically, yes.

44:40.612 --> 44:42.812
But they totally did it.

44:42.814 --> 44:44.681
Garfield?

44:44.683 --> 44:47.083
That was inappropriate.
Go on.

44:47.585 --> 44:49.686
It gets weirder.

44:49.688 --> 44:52.922
Mom fled the cult
and was on the run
with nowhere to go,

44:52.924 --> 44:55.692
when she gets saved by
these people from
another dimension.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.364
<i> The people of azarath.</i>

45:01.366 --> 45:04.467
<i> A realm of beauty,</i>
<i> peace and tranquility</i>

45:06.037 --> 45:09.305
<i> where, needless to say,</i>
<i> I did not fit in.</i>

45:09.307 --> 45:11.741
<i> And I must have inherited</i>
<i> my mom's terrible judgment</i>

45:11.743 --> 45:14.510
<i> because I thought if</i>
<i> I found out more about</i>
<i> the monster who made me,</i>

45:14.512 --> 45:16.479
<i> I'd be able to</i>
<i> make sense of myself.</i>

45:50.215 --> 45:51.481
Raven...

46:09.000 --> 46:12.034
Poor mother, poor azarath.

46:12.036 --> 46:14.070
I became its trojan horse.

46:15.607 --> 46:18.141
He took me to his
hellish universe.

46:18.143 --> 46:20.877
I could hardly bear
the horrors I saw there.

46:20.879 --> 46:22.578
Why did trigon want you?

46:22.580 --> 46:25.648
He wanted earth.
He's a conqueror of worlds.

46:25.650 --> 46:28.818
But he needs a
powerful conduit
to open earth to his control.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.753
And you're half human.

46:30.755 --> 46:32.155
His way in.

46:32.157 --> 46:34.757
But my magic was stronger
than he realized.

46:34.759 --> 46:38.795
<i> Before he could use me,</i>
<i> I was able to trap him</i>
<i> inside a crystal.</i>

46:38.797 --> 46:40.296
<i> It should've held him.</i>

46:40.298 --> 46:41.998
<i> Perhaps if I had</i>
<i> stayed there,</i>

46:42.000 --> 46:43.266
<i> it would have.</i>

46:44.736 --> 46:46.536
But I wanted a home.

46:46.538 --> 46:48.704
Why didn't you go back
to azarath?

46:49.974 --> 46:51.307
This is azarath.

47:09.027 --> 47:10.860
Don't worry, I'm not staying.

47:10.862 --> 47:13.663
I've got to keep moving
to keep trigon off my path.

47:13.665 --> 47:15.064
Where will you go?

47:15.066 --> 47:16.632
It's better you not know.

47:16.634 --> 47:19.368
He's going to try to use you
but don't worry,

47:19.370 --> 47:21.938
I put a protective spell
on you, just in case.

47:21.940 --> 47:24.473
And I thought I had
a bad burrito.

47:24.475 --> 47:25.942
Dude.

47:25.944 --> 47:28.711
Guess I should've gotten
your permission or whatever.

47:28.713 --> 47:30.713
But I couldn't stand for him
to corrupt you.

47:30.715 --> 47:33.149
You're the only friends
I've ever really had.

47:33.852 --> 47:35.151
I'll...

47:35.687 --> 47:36.752
Miss you.

47:41.526 --> 47:43.192
Wait!

47:43.194 --> 47:45.928
Leave now and you'll
always be running.

47:45.930 --> 47:47.730
You have no idea
what he's like, Damian.

47:47.732 --> 47:49.699
You've never met
a monster like trigon.

47:49.701 --> 47:51.234
You beat him once.

47:51.970 --> 47:53.469
I was lucky.

47:53.471 --> 47:55.805
Now you'll be four times
as lucky.

47:55.807 --> 47:58.107
If we can't save
one of our own,

47:58.109 --> 47:59.375
who can we save?

47:59.377 --> 48:02.011
I thought you hated us.

48:02.013 --> 48:04.280
I'm not wishing you
dead anymore.

48:04.282 --> 48:07.016
Robin's right,
we are your best hope.

48:17.829 --> 48:19.328
Down, boy.

48:19.330 --> 48:21.030
We heard about the attack.

48:21.032 --> 48:22.832
Was she at the center?

48:22.834 --> 48:26.068
Her father is
an inter-dimensional demon.
He was after her.

48:26.070 --> 48:28.104
She's coming with us.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.172
No, we can handle this.

48:30.174 --> 48:32.642
If she's part of this,
we need to know.

48:32.644 --> 48:33.709
We can protect her.

48:38.049 --> 48:43.185
I'm sorry, raven.
We've had two magic attacks
and superman is still missing.

48:43.187 --> 48:45.454
- No.
- What's the matter?

48:45.456 --> 48:47.690
He knows they're here,
he wants them here.

48:47.692 --> 48:49.025
Who?

48:49.027 --> 48:50.693
If they stay,
everything will be lost.

48:50.695 --> 48:54.163
This is our job, father,
you have to leave.

48:54.165 --> 48:55.932
Father?

48:55.934 --> 48:57.600
She's coming with us.

48:57.602 --> 48:58.834
She stays here.

49:03.675 --> 49:06.342
Maybe we should all
take a breath.

49:06.344 --> 49:08.344
Too late, they're here.

49:12.817 --> 49:13.916
Great hera!

49:14.986 --> 49:16.085
Argh!

49:16.087 --> 49:18.654
Argh! We're being compromised.

49:19.891 --> 49:21.857
-Father!
-Get back.

49:26.331 --> 49:29.198
-What the hell?
-It's a nerve toxin.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.666
For bane.

49:34.739 --> 49:36.238
Dude...

49:43.281 --> 49:46.949
The Kryptonian has unearthed
the infernal shrine, raven.

49:46.951 --> 49:48.250
The who did the what?

49:48.252 --> 49:50.152
An ancient shrine
built by satanists.

49:50.154 --> 49:51.787
It has magical properties.

49:51.789 --> 49:55.091
You are the shrine's
final piece.

49:55.093 --> 49:56.859
She stays here.

49:56.861 --> 49:59.528
You dare challenge us?

50:44.108 --> 50:45.374
Whoa!

50:59.924 --> 51:01.323
Argh!

51:11.936 --> 51:13.636
Beetle...

51:23.714 --> 51:24.780
Ugh!

51:31.389 --> 51:33.823
I will break her, raven.

51:35.193 --> 51:38.461
I stop my hand for an instant
and this one dies, too.

51:38.930 --> 51:40.763
Wait!

51:40.765 --> 51:43.933
I'll go. As the daughter of
your lord trigon,

51:43.935 --> 51:46.869
I order you to release
these feeble humans.

52:03.921 --> 52:04.920
Goodbye.

52:17.368 --> 52:18.968
Get him inside.

52:41.425 --> 52:43.826
Your father awaits.

52:43.828 --> 52:44.994
Don't touch me.

53:04.882 --> 53:08.083
<i> There had better be</i>
<i> no trickery this time, girl,</i>

53:08.085 --> 53:11.554
<i> if you want any mercy</i>
<i> shown your friends.</i>

53:12.089 --> 53:13.489
No tricks.

53:13.491 --> 53:16.325
Look, I'm begging you,
leave this world alone.

53:16.327 --> 53:18.294
<i> And thwart destiny?</i>

53:18.296 --> 53:21.163
<i> We were meant to be together.</i>

53:21.165 --> 53:22.531
<i> Always.</i>

53:23.100 --> 53:24.867
<i> And we shall.</i>

54:00.004 --> 54:01.604
Think he's back online.

54:02.440 --> 54:04.206
Holy crap!

54:04.208 --> 54:07.576
-Did that sound
demonic to anyone else?
-A little.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.746
The things it made me see.

54:11.582 --> 54:14.516
Cyborg, how do we save raven?

54:15.219 --> 54:16.518
I...

54:16.520 --> 54:18.487
I don't think you can.

54:22.660 --> 54:25.194
Oh, no. How bad is he?

54:26.731 --> 54:28.731
He's been out for 24 hours.

54:28.733 --> 54:30.299
He sacrificed himself,

54:30.301 --> 54:34.236
risked death to give us
a fighting chance at life.

54:34.238 --> 54:36.472
Which is more than I can say
for the rest of the league.

54:36.474 --> 54:39.341
Damian, this isn't
the time to squabble.

54:39.343 --> 54:40.542
We have to get raven back.

54:40.544 --> 54:43.245
We don't even know
where she is.

54:43.247 --> 54:47.349
She's in the middle east,
60 miles north
of kahndaq city.

54:47.351 --> 54:49.685
-How do you...
-I put a tracer on her.

54:49.687 --> 54:52.488
-When?
-About 30 seconds
after we met.

54:52.490 --> 54:54.590
Same time I put one
on each of you.

54:56.027 --> 54:57.693
What?

54:57.695 --> 55:01.530
Cyborg, you have the ability
to manifest boom tubes,
do you not?

55:01.532 --> 55:03.198
Yeah, I can boom us there.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.801
But you guys barely held
your own against flash
and wonder woman,

55:05.803 --> 55:08.404
and that's without superman
being on deck.

55:08.406 --> 55:10.105
He shouldn't
be a problem.

55:10.107 --> 55:13.509
Yeah, right, like you got
a way to take out superman.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.949
Oh, my god, I think he does.

55:37.768 --> 55:39.201
You heard the plan.

55:40.071 --> 55:41.637
Titans, go!

56:27.418 --> 56:29.051
You mind removing that?

56:39.163 --> 56:40.028
What?

56:43.234 --> 56:44.333
Damian.

56:45.136 --> 56:46.201
Starfire.

56:47.405 --> 56:48.771
You okayed this?

56:50.841 --> 56:51.907
Yes.

56:52.977 --> 56:54.042
Good call.

56:57.148 --> 56:59.248
It's okay, it's healing.

57:13.597 --> 57:17.166
I've got flash,
the rest of you
get raven off that thing.

57:35.286 --> 57:36.652
Aah!

57:37.521 --> 57:38.787
Argh!

57:45.029 --> 57:47.362
Barry, if you can hear me
in there,

57:48.299 --> 57:49.364
sorry.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.108
Ow.

58:00.110 --> 58:02.544
How long will it take you
to heal?

58:02.546 --> 58:04.813
Ah, oh, my god,
an hour?

58:04.815 --> 58:06.849
Also, seriously?

58:06.851 --> 58:08.383
You've got 10 minutes.

58:31.208 --> 58:34.877
Your power is no match for
that of trigon, Kryptonian.

58:34.879 --> 58:36.912
She doesn't belong
to you, devil.

58:50.094 --> 58:52.761
Let me go, you alien filth.

58:57.735 --> 58:59.535
You sicken me.

58:59.537 --> 59:01.803
I never cared.

59:01.805 --> 59:03.639
I never loved you.

59:03.641 --> 59:05.140
Who are you?

59:05.142 --> 59:08.343
I am corruption incarnate,

59:08.345 --> 59:11.513
you piece of...

59:11.515 --> 59:13.916
The lasso commands you answer.

59:14.652 --> 59:15.717
Argh!

59:15.719 --> 59:18.287
I... I...

59:18.289 --> 59:19.354
Argh!

59:22.426 --> 59:25.060
I am Diana of Themyscira.

59:25.462 --> 59:26.828
Argh!

59:32.770 --> 59:34.469
It's okay.

59:34.471 --> 59:35.904
I've got you now.

59:37.508 --> 59:38.774
Mmm...

59:39.476 --> 59:41.209
Just like in the movies.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:13.775
You can get off my back now,
boy bony-ass.

01:00:19.617 --> 01:00:21.416
- You all right?

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.186
Nothing is right.

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:28.290
Run!

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.858
Everyone, run!

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:03.392
Well, this sucks.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:09.531
Great hera.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.847
He'll bring hell on earth.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.783
How do we stop him?

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:31.219
-There's only one way.
-You're going to put him back
in the crystal.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.288
In the unlikely event
that I can make it there.

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:38.994
He's heading for the city.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:40.429
<i> Superman,</i>

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:41.596
raven has a plan.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:43.999
The titans need my help.

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:47.569
I'm going to hell.

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:57.345
Oh, I don't feel so good.

01:01:57.347 --> 01:01:59.314
The crystal can only
be touched by me.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:01.349
He may have escaped it,
but he can't destroy it.

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:03.618
I just hope he left a trail
of breadcrumbs.

01:02:17.668 --> 01:02:19.334
Home, sweet home.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:22.671
Can't you just
transport us inside?

01:02:22.673 --> 01:02:24.339
No, it's shielded.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.125
Maybe this
will slow you down.

01:02:48.699 --> 01:02:49.765
Ugh...

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.409
Garfield!

01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:05.046
Dude, what the hell?

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:57.933
Gar, you still with us?

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:27.662
Little help!

01:04:37.808 --> 01:04:40.575
-If we cannot stop
this creature...
-I know.

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:06.768
Argh!

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:17.779
Welcome home,
sister.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.886
It's the freak show again.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.164
Get inside!

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.220
Dude!

01:07:39.022 --> 01:07:40.755
Grandfather?

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:43.358
Damian, my blood.

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:48.663
It's a trick. I saw you die.

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:52.000
No trick. It's me.
I assure you.

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:54.402
I exist.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.671
Lord trigon is my sustenance.

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:02.043
-He's a devil.
-No.

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:04.412
He's a god of necessity.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.414
How do you think I attained
my power?

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.883
Where do you think
the Lazarus pits came from?

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:11.753
It's all his doing,

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:15.623
and he can make things
whole again for a price.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:18.158
He can give us the world
we wanted.

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:21.563
You and I. A perfect world.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:24.866
She's the only one
who stands in the way.

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:26.533
Prove your love, grandson.

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:28.837
Take care of this for me.

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:32.340
Before my pact
with trigon expires.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:37.278
I... I would do anything
to bring you back,

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.781
but, grandfather, I don't...

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:40.948
You hesitate.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:43.484
Why?

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:47.622
Are you afraid to do
the one act that will
restore me to life?

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:49.524
I'm not afraid of anything.

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:51.658
You dare disobey me?

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.560
Have you forgotten
your heritage?

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.630
You are an al ghul.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.700
No, I'm a titan.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:08.710
<i> Stupid girl.</i>

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:13.515
<i> You think your allies</i>
<i> can stop me</i>
<i> now that I'm here?</i>

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:19.921
<i> The justice league,</i>
<i> defenders of this realm,</i>
<i> less than insects to me.</i>

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:24.292
<i> I will strip bare the flesh</i>
<i> from their bones.</i>

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:29.564
<i> And your pathetic friends,</i>
<i> I will make them</i>
<i> suffer endlessly,</i>

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:33.368
<i> and you will have to watch.</i>

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:37.906
<i> Soon, your souls will belong</i>
<i> to trigon,</i>

01:09:37.908 --> 01:09:41.576
<i> as will your world.</i>

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:00.929
Your friends
have made you soft.

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:03.598
Ungrateful child.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.368
You could have been immortal,
like me.

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:10.638
<i> Give up.</i>

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.408
<i> You're too weak</i>
<i> to stop me, raven.</i>

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:14.976
<i> You always have been.</i>

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:17.745
<i> Just like your mother.</i>

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:20.882
<i> No, my only weakness</i>
<i> was loving you,</i>

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:23.918
<i> hoping I'd be loved in return.</i>

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.487
<i> But all you were capable</i>
<i> of giving is pain,</i>

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:28.423
<i> so I ran away</i>

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:30.558
<i> and found friends,</i>

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:33.494
<i> friends I would give</i>
<i> my life for,</i>

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.964
<i> friends who give me love</i>

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.633
<i> and the strength to do this.</i>

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:14.002
Damian, save me!

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:34.789
Grant me the strength
of mighty azarath

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:38.860
to contain the demon trigon
within this sacred shard,
now and forever.

01:11:58.248 --> 01:11:59.580
Huh?

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.943
Raven!

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.047
Is it over?

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:07.715
It'll never be over.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.818
Trigon will spend
every single minute
trying to get out of here,

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:14.555
so he needs to be watched
every single minute.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.093
Dude, thanks for helping out.

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:21.162
It was nice to have
a big gun around.

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:24.966
Yeah, you ought to dump
those stuck-up jerks
and sign up with us.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:27.135
It was nice not to be
the kid for once,

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:29.303
but when you've been
in the majors...

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:30.605
You know what I'm saying.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:40.748
Time to go home.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:46.721
I'll take you back.

01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:56.130
Unfortunately,

01:13:58.301 --> 01:13:59.667
this is my home.

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:03.771
I have to watch him.

01:14:06.342 --> 01:14:07.742
It's not your home.

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:10.244
Home is the place where...

01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:14.982
When you have to go there,
they have to take you in.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:19.287
Robert frost.
You are full of surprises,
Damian.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.589
You're coming with us.

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:37.405
<i> I've sifted through</i>
<i> all the data</i>

01:14:37.407 --> 01:14:39.540
<i> and found no signs</i>
<i> of the corruptors</i>
<i> for the 10 days</i>

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:42.143
<i> since our encounter</i>
<i> with trigon.</i>

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:44.545
<i> In other words,</i>
<i> great work, titans.</i>

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:48.850
<i> Your determination</i>
<i> and teamwork saved the world,</i>

01:14:48.852 --> 01:14:52.320
<i> and us. You should be</i>
<i> very proud of them, kori.</i>

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:57.658
<i> As are we.</i>

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:02.797
Hey, guys, it's pizza night.

01:15:02.799 --> 01:15:04.932
Boom tube delivery.
Less than 30...

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:08.269
Minutes.

01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:11.205
<i> Carry on, titans.</i>

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:15.176
Okay, that was awkward.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.979
Enough talk. Let's eat.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:24.952
Hey, isn't that...

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:26.754
He always said
we should be together.

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:29.690
That's gotta be torture
for him.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.694
Well, you can take the girl
out of hell...

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.696
<i> Raven, release me.</i>

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:39.934
<i> You're too weak</i>
<i> to keep me in here,</i>
<i> you filthy witch!</i>

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:43.437
<i> I'll get out!</i>
<i> I'll kill everyone you love.</i>

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:45.039
<i> Raven!</i>
