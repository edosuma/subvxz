00:02.837 --> 00:05.547
Before we get started, I have a
few things I need to give you.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.800
Shut your eyes.
Ready?

00:07.800 --> 00:11.010
Ta da!
Look at that.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.514
From Kira.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.098
That was...cool.

00:15.098 --> 00:18.226
This, Vince...
Eergh.

00:18.226 --> 00:21.522
Wow, huh?
Look at that Vince.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.649
-What is it?
-A paper weight.

00:23.649 --> 00:29.112
A paper weight.
Ahh, silly me.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.739
Come get this. Please.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.742
I don't write on two foot
by three foot paper either.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.829
Just so you know.

00:36.829 --> 00:41.583
Yeah. I had to bring
that to and from my house.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.462
-[Lucy] Sir, what are those?
-These are the gifts you
gave me last year.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.716
That I have no use for.
So I'm giving them back.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.968
So, to make this easier.

00:50.968 --> 00:56.724
At the end of this year, I have
registered at The Golfatorium.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.644
Very simple. Go home, show
the brochure to your parents.

01:00.644 --> 01:05.691
Go online, look up my name,
buy a gift. Nice and easy.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.944
-This driver is $500!
-Start saving.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.864
For things like that,
for the driver,

01:11.864 --> 01:13.741
two families can join up.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.784
Sir, isn't it
the thought that counts?

01:15.784 --> 01:19.538
It's the gift that counts.
That's all that counts,
is the gift.

01:19.538 --> 01:25.002
How much I like you,
a lot of it is based on that
gift at the end of the year.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.504
A lot of teachers won't tell
you that, but it's the truth.

01:27.504 --> 01:31.633
You get me that driver,
you watch your mark.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.928

-Any ideas?
-What about Duncan?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.198
-What about me?
-Just give us a second, Duncan.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.784
Yeah, but you just
said my name, why?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.159
It throws a wrench in
things though doesn't it?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.578
A wrench in...are you sick?

01:59.578 --> 02:01.747
-No.
-You could cover
some of the classes.

02:01.747 --> 02:05.292
Bobbi, you look sick
and if you're sick you
should really tell people.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.335
-He could cover
a class in his spare.
-That works.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.504
-Yeah.
-Duncan, I need you
to cover one of Jeff's

02:09.504 --> 02:11.757
Phys-Ed classes in your spare
the next couple weeks.

02:11.757 --> 02:15.719
Shut up! You...
Shut up!

02:15.719 --> 02:16.637
[Gerry laughs]

02:16.637 --> 02:17.846
Shut! Up!

02:17.846 --> 02:20.515
-Okay.
-Oh! The boss!

02:20.515 --> 02:23.727
-[Bobbi] I got it.
-The boss, teach Phys-Ed.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.480
-I am..Oh my...
-[Bobbi] Yeah, we didn't
expect this.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.776
So I will cover Jeff's other
class in my spare and he'll
be back in a couple weeks.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.987
-This is like an audition.
-[Bobbi laughs] No, it's
nothing...

02:32.987 --> 02:35.280
-It is. Oh my god.
-[Bobbi] No, it's nothing
like an audition.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.826
-Gerry does a good job...
-[Bobbi whispers] Oh my god.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.996
[Gerry] Gerry teaches
full time Phys-Ed. Wow.

02:41.996 --> 02:45.749
Gerry, you have
a Phys-Ed degree, okay?
And it works with your schedule.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.085
-[Gerry] Mmm hmm. That's why.
-That's the only reason
Callaghan asked you to do this.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.587
-That's it.
-[Gerry] Only reason, mmm.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.922
Ohhh!

02:51.922 --> 02:53.632
-[Robert] Sir.
-[Callaghan] Appreciate it.

02:53.632 --> 02:56.135
There you are. Just a reminder
that, that reporter from

02:56.135 --> 02:59.888
National Teachers Society
Magazine is coming to do
that profile on me.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.807
I don't recall you telling
me anything about that.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.934
-Why are they interviewing you?
-[Robert] Trudy!

03:03.934 --> 03:07.228
Not going to let you
get to me. Okay?

03:07.228 --> 03:08.814
Sir, I told you this.
Cover story,

03:08.814 --> 03:10.691
good exposure
for the school. Remember?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.067
You know what? You're right.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.443
With enrolment down,

03:13.443 --> 03:14.903
this could be good publicity.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.323
-Well done, Robert.
-Thank you, Sir.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.075
You know, Trudy, I'm thinking
of asking a few members

03:20.075 --> 03:22.077
of the staff to join me
in the cover photo.

03:22.077 --> 03:27.082
-Ooooh, exciting.
-You mean that?

03:27.082 --> 03:29.960
Nope!

03:29.960 --> 03:31.419
[Trudy laughs]

03:31.419 --> 03:34.006
-[school bell rings]
-[Simon] Knock, knock, knock.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.924
-Hi everyone, can I talk
to you for a second?
-Oh, hey. Yeah.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.510
Just kind of read quietly
amongst yourselves there.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.595
I've got this new student Jake,
who's got ADD.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.723
And, I know you're so
good at handling it.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.641
-I was wondering if you could
talk to him after school.
-Yeah, it's a...

03:44.641 --> 03:46.685
tough disease to live with.
I know what that's like.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.188
-Well, it's not really
a disease, but...
-Really?

03:49.188 --> 03:52.524
Well you don't live with it.
Do you know what it's like to
have one thought in your head,

03:52.524 --> 03:55.694
and then five other thoughts
enter at the same time?
Have you ever had that happen?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.696
No, I just mean it's a
disorder, not a disease.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.240
Okay, what are you thinking
about right now, Mr. Hunt?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.617
-[Simon] Jake.
-One thing? I have five
things in my head.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.870
Why does the room
smell like paint?
Do I need to pick up

04:04.870 --> 04:06.705
my dry cleaning today?
Or is that tomorrow?

04:06.705 --> 04:09.208
[Simon] Hmm.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.836
By the way, that's
not the right chapter.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.462
Do you have all those things
in your head at once?

04:14.462 --> 04:19.259
That list, I just checked
them all off. Sooo...What?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.053
-Would you see Jake
after school?
-Yes.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.139
-[Simon] Okay.
-About?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.599
-ADD. That kid.
-[Simon] ADD.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.851
[Gerry] Yeah, yeah I know. See?
[clicks tongue]

04:27.851 --> 04:29.937
-Locked in.
-It all comes around.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.774
-Tell him to come see me though.
-Thank you.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.443
Wow.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.113
Ah, Trudy? Can I talk
to you for a second?

04:39.113 --> 04:43.450
Ummm, I was wondering if on the
day that the reporter comes...

04:43.450 --> 04:46.745
If you could, um, you know?

04:46.745 --> 04:49.539
-Leave your gal pals at home?
-Excuse me?

04:49.539 --> 04:52.167
I wouldn't mind if you could
cover yourself up when the
reporter's here.

04:52.167 --> 04:56.213
So maybe if you could
hide your...Shirt sherpas?

04:56.213 --> 05:00.550
Your pro-trudy's?
Your, um...blouse beagles.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.303
Trudy! Your breasts,
hide your breasts.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.264
[kids giggle]

05:05.264 --> 05:07.849
[Gerry] Alright, as you're
aware, Mr. Lemire is away
for a few weeks.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.311
I will be covering this class
in his absence, okay?

05:11.311 --> 05:14.689
-Sir, can you teach gym?
-[Gerry laughs]

05:14.689 --> 05:18.819
My degree is in
Physical Education
which is what we call it.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.905
Kinesiology, 'cause that's
what I studied in university.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.199
We learned anatomy,
we learned physiology.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.785
We take the same
courses as doctors.

05:26.785 --> 05:31.081
They cure people, we prevent you
from getting injured and sick.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.583
They just make a lot more money.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.294
Do we still get to
play floor hockey?

05:35.294 --> 05:38.088
Yes, we get to play floor
hockey and lots of fun things.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.882
But first we have to
do some fitness testing.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.341
I need to see what
kind of shape you're in.

05:42.341 --> 05:45.053
I don't care, in Phys-Ed,
how smart you are.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.764
'Cause, if you're a dead
smart person, who cares?

05:47.764 --> 05:50.309
You need to stay healthy. So
we're going to do some testing.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.727
We're going to do three
things today, we're going
to do sit and reach.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.814
To test your flexibility.
We're going to do the beep test.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.192
One of my favourites.
And the flexed arm hang.

05:58.192 --> 06:02.321
Which I will demonstrate. Lucy's
going to record the times.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.363
Alright? What's going
to happen is this.

06:04.363 --> 06:07.784
You are going to stand on
the chair to get yourself
to this level.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.621
Once you pull yourself to eye
level, we pull the chair away.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.166
Okay, Lucy, when I say.
Alright, pull the chair away.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.169
Now that's eye level.
That's not eye level.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.880
That's not eye level.
Right here, and you hold it.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.091
And you fight it. And you fight
it. You fight it like a mother.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.135
You fight it.
You fight the pain!

06:25.135 --> 06:28.013
'Cause there's pain right now.
A lot of pain.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.724
Fight the pain! And then...
How long was that?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.434
How long, who timed it?
Who timed it?

06:33.434 --> 06:35.854
No one timed it? Gotta time it.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.148
Always time it. Okay?
I will be timing yours.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.193
Write down 60 seconds, I think
that's how long that was.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.028
We'll go with that.

06:43.028 --> 06:46.198
Okay?! Let's see how we do.
Let's go, who's first
on the list?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.116
-[Lucy] Cameron.
-[Gerry] Come on up Cameron.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.786
Let's get the stop watch ready.
You will pull yourself up.

06:51.786 --> 06:55.832
Once you are at eye level,
I will pull the chair away
and we'll see how long you do.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.459
Stay up there as
long as you can!

06:58.459 --> 07:03.464
Cameron, I need you to fight
the pain you feel in your arms.

07:03.464 --> 07:07.677
You need to push yourselves.
Ready?

07:07.677 --> 07:09.470
Go.
[stop watch beeps]

07:09.470 --> 07:12.266
Okay, I didn't...okay,
.2 seconds.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.352
-Should I round
it up to one second?
-No, we don't round up .2.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.604
You round .2 down,
which I'm not going to do.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.564
Alright, Tanya, come on up.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.401
Listen, listen,
don't get discouraged.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.404
We're going to keep this
positive. You will be my
project while I'm here.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.030
We will fix this.

07:27.030 --> 07:33.578
-Alright, let's do better
than .2 seconds.
-[music]

07:33.578 --> 07:34.996
[Gerry] Come on,
what's all this?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.373
No peanut butter sandwiches.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.541
Come on, that's what
Epi pens are for.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.001
-[Bobbi] Gerry
-Yeah?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.586
Some of the kids
came up to me and told me

07:41.586 --> 07:43.463
they didn't have any fun
in gym class today.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.049
-Who would say...?
Are you kidding me?
-[Bobbi] No.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.302
Ask Mark Moher if he had fun.
Look at those fitness results.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.512
Okay, do you think it's
appropriate to post the fitness
results of these young kids?

07:51.512 --> 07:53.223
-They're, like, 11.
-[Gerry] Are you kidding me?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.434
-My math teacher posted
my marks in the school.
-Okay.

07:55.434 --> 07:58.853
The whole school saw my
48% average. Did I get upset?

07:58.853 --> 08:01.481
No, I used it to motivate myself
and get good at math.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.484
Actually, ask me 11 times
any two digit number.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.069
-I'm not playing this game.
-[Gerry] No, watch how
fast I can do this.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.405
-I'm not...11X13?
-143.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.240
-11X12?
-132.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.077
-11X28?
-I can't do that one.
There's a rule.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.455
-This is humiliating for them!
-Oh my gosh! Not humiliate...

08:16.455 --> 08:18.832
Cameron Andreou needs to see
this to motivate himself.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.168
-Oh boy.
-This is how we teach
them, alright?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.919
He needs to rise
to the occasion.

08:22.919 --> 08:27.090
Rise up, rise up.
All rise and show your power.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.801
Parachute Club.
My god.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.220
-We have different
philosophy's, Gerry.
-Yes, we do.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.514
Phys-Ed is supposed
to be fun, Gerry.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.475
I will have more fun,
I will have lots of fun.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.560
-That's all I'm asking.
-Yeah, we'll have a lot,
and we'll get in shape.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.438
-[Bobbi] Fine.
-It will be fun
and getting in shape.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.815
-And, you'll go easy on them?
-Yeah, I'll go easy on them.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.442
[Bobbi] Thank you.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.403
And, I left a memo up here about
peanut butter in the school.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.989
Ah, jeez, these kids. You could
die from eating peanut butter.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.493
-[Bobbi] Unbelievable.
-Who would do that?

08:54.493 --> 08:55.702
Right.

08:58.497 --> 09:02.417
Oh peanut butter.
Gosh!

09:02.417 --> 09:04.169
Everybody knows this.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.296
[music]

09:06.296 --> 09:08.631
Ah, Mr. Malik.
There you are.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.591
I just wanted to let you
know that a reporter

09:10.591 --> 09:13.803
is coming tomorrow to the
school to do a story on me.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.682
They'll be taking pictures,
so can you please make sure
the school is extra clean?

09:17.682 --> 09:19.809
Why you always come
to me with this?

09:19.809 --> 09:23.230
I always keep the school clean!
When I not have the
school clean?

09:23.230 --> 09:27.484
This school...

09:27.484 --> 09:28.818
Impecable!

09:28.818 --> 09:32.447
[Robert mouths to student]
Hi. Calm down!

09:32.447 --> 09:35.534
I am your vice principal,
I could fire you.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.036
You want fire Malik?

09:38.036 --> 09:40.372
Go ahead! Fire Malik!

09:40.372 --> 09:43.208
[Robert] Put your jacket back
on. I don't want to fire you.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.920
Okay? It was just a note,
a reporter's coming tomorrow
to do a story on me.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.588
They're going to take
some pictures of me.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.965
So please just make sure
the school's clean, that's it.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.844
You don't need to do that.
I understand.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.722
Hey, so, how'd your meeting
with Jake go yesterday?

09:57.722 --> 10:01.351
Good, it was good, he's good.
It was, ah, he's coming along,
I think.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.062
Lying to my face.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.314
-You didn't meet
with him at all.
-I forgot.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.316
-He showed up and you
weren't there, Gerry.
-I know.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.027
-You were supposed to meet
with him about the ADD.
-Oh my gosh.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.613
I have ADD, that's the stuff
that happens when you put
someone in charge.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.449
I told his parents you would
have met with him by now. Okay?

10:15.449 --> 10:17.867
-They'll understand.
-No, would you meet
with him tomorrow?

10:17.867 --> 10:21.871
I will meet with him tomorrow,
I will make a note, I have less
things in my head.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.290
-Okay.
-Oh, one more thing.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.251
Where'd you get that belt?

10:26.251 --> 10:29.170
-I'm going to go.
-Okay. Tell me later.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.756
[music]

10:31.756 --> 10:33.674
So apparently,
I'm not a fun gym teacher.

10:33.674 --> 10:37.762
-Physical Education teacher.
-Gym teacher, Stephan.

10:37.762 --> 10:42.809
'Cause what I was
teaching yesterday
was Physical Education.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.938
But apparently you don't care
how or why your body moves
the way it does.

10:46.938 --> 10:50.733
You just want to have fun.
So, we'll have fun
and I'll teach gym.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.736
Today, we'll play floor hockey
and we will have fun.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.448
And I will play, and I will
show you how it's done.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.450
So grab a stick please,
split yourselves up.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.328
Two teams, hurry up.
Just grab any stick.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.456
You don't have to spend all day
looking for the best one.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.171
Nah, no, no. Cameron and
you three? That's not fair.

11:11.171 --> 11:15.467
Even if I play with this team
guys, I can't work miracles
with this group.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.928
Old school put your sticks in
the middle I will throw them up.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.349
This is how it's done,
spread out.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.811
Once you see your stick, grab
it. That is the team you are on.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.272
I don't want to hear
anybody complaining.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.774
-Sir, all the sticks...
-Stephan.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.943
If you keep talking,
I'm going to lose count.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.446
-Sir, the sticks are the same.
-What?

11:36.446 --> 11:39.032
They're the same colour.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.242
Oh yeah, that doesn't work.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.995
Alright, grab a stick then,
but just do it evenly this time.

11:43.995 --> 11:48.249
Let's mix it up a little bit,
even teams, alright?

11:48.249 --> 11:51.836
You just did the same thing. You
did the same thing, you went...

11:51.836 --> 11:54.047
-Lucy, what are you doing?
-I'm getting ready.

11:54.047 --> 11:59.969
For what? A sword fight?
Oh gosh.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.473
-Why don't you have a stick?
-I forgot to go get it.

12:03.473 --> 12:09.062
Oh, you forgot to go get it.
Four seconds ago.

12:09.062 --> 12:14.484
Okay. Well you guys are lucky
I'm on your team, because
I'm the best player, so.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.986
Although again guys, we've got
to balance the teams out.

12:16.986 --> 12:21.658
You've got to go on
that side Alex. Okay?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.451
Alright, these are fair.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.620
-Mr. Leung.
-[Leung] Mmm?

12:25.620 --> 12:28.289
Good news. I am giving you
the rest of the day off.

12:28.289 --> 12:32.210
-Why?
-You haven't taken a
sick day in 16 years.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.045
Who knows, a little break
might do you some good.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.674
I've been collecting my sick
days so I can retire early.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.801
Mr. Leung, you can't
carry over sick days.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.680
That no longer exists.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.307
I've been coming in
sick for no reason?

12:46.307 --> 12:49.185
'Fraid so.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.939
Get outta here, take
today as a sick day.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.817
Why don't you want me here?

12:56.817 --> 13:00.655
-I don't not want you here.
-So then you want me here?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.949
Well, I can't say that, but...

13:02.949 --> 13:07.036
So then I won't be here or not.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.331
I want you to be here?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.459
Then I won't be here.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.629
Thank you.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.381
Stop something Anthony.
9-6.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.049
[Stephan] Alright guys,
one more goal and we win.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.218
-No, it's up to 15.
-You said it was up to 10.

13:22.218 --> 13:26.222
I changed it to 15, pay
attention. Give me ball,
give me the ball, Anthony.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.224
Cameron, give me the ball.
Cameron, Cameron!

13:28.224 --> 13:31.394
That's why I asked for the ball.
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh!

13:31.394 --> 13:34.855
-Oh! Five hole! Five hole!
-[kids cheer]

13:34.855 --> 13:38.401
Delay of game, hurry up.
Delay of game! Come on,
that's delay of game!

13:38.401 --> 13:40.654
-[Stephan] Alex, Alex, Alex.
-[Alex] Come on, give me
the ball, I'm open, I'm open.

13:40.654 --> 13:44.282
-Let's go, hurry up.
-[Stephan] Go Alex go.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.284
[Gerry] Get out of the way,
get out of the way.
Where'd the ball go?

13:46.284 --> 13:48.911
Find the ball!!
Where's the ball?

13:48.911 --> 13:52.081
It's under him. It's under him.
It's under him, it's under him,
get up!

13:52.081 --> 13:54.959
There we go. I got it!
Ah!

13:54.959 --> 13:57.754
-Yeah!!!
-[kids cheer]

13:57.754 --> 14:00.381
Get up Alex, come on.
Alex?

14:00.381 --> 14:03.510
-[Alex groans]
-Come on, Alex.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.638
Alex! Why'd you give
him a suicide pass?

14:06.638 --> 14:08.431
[Alex groans]

14:08.431 --> 14:11.601
Alex? Hey buddy. You there?
You know you ran into me right?

14:11.601 --> 14:13.102
I was just standing
my ground there.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.146
Alright, 9-8,
let's keep playing.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.774
He's out. We can't keep
playing, the game's over.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.150
-We win!
-[Stephan] Why do you win?

14:19.150 --> 14:21.611
Because, you lost
a player, so we win.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.903
Hey, did you see my goal?

14:22.903 --> 14:25.406
Don't tell me you blacked
out before that!

14:25.406 --> 14:27.908
[music]

14:27.908 --> 14:32.497
Okay, so, tell me,
what happened, Mr. Duncan?

14:32.497 --> 14:37.126
Alright, well, Alex's team was
winning 9-8. Game goes to 15.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.671
It was originally 10, sir,
but Mr. D kept changing it.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.256
I kept changing it because
we had more time, Alex.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.008
I wanted to give us
more time to play.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.428
-Just tell me how he got hurt.
-Mr. Duncan body checked me.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.640
Oh, hear we go. First of all you
were upset I had seven goals.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.141
I don't think you had
any at that point.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.227
And it was in your head,
I was in your kitchen.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.270
So you weren't focused.
You were running around

14:56.270 --> 15:01.442
-like a loose canon, careless.
-Mr. Duncan...

15:01.442 --> 15:06.698
Sorry. Stephan gave him a
suicide pass that I went to
intercept, he ran into me.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.366
So where's Stephan?
Is what I ask.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.660
Who gives a suicide pass?
That's who to blame.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.746
-Stephan should...be in...
-Okay, wait.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.164
-Alex, how are you feeling?
-Better, sir.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.625
I don't remember a few things,
but I feel better.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.169
Remember my fifth goal?
Remember this one? The toe drag?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.714
Through your legs?
Right up in your face?

15:22.714 --> 15:24.716
-Bet you remember that.
-[Callaghan] Okay, okay.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.886
Alex, why don't you wait
outside? Your parents
are on their way.

15:27.886 --> 15:31.598
Okay, see you buddy.
See, he's all set. Good
job buddy. He's fine.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.393
Gerry, I don't think it's such
a good idea you're actually
playing with the kids.

15:35.393 --> 15:39.021
No, no, that's...you let
them see what they have
the potential to be like.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.858
-You give them a demonstration.
-Okay, look you got
a lot on your plate.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.610
I'm bringing in a sub
for the next few weeks.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.904
No, no, no. No, no, no. I'm
fine. Let me finish teaching.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.197
No, I'm fine with the extra
course. We don't need a sub.

15:48.197 --> 15:53.745
-I can handle an extra course.
-My decision is final.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.872
Okay. But that wasn't an
audition to teach Phys-Ed.

15:55.872 --> 15:59.125
Bobbi said that, she made it
very clear when I started
doing this class.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.295
-Not an audition.
-Bye bye.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.547
-Sir, kids have concussions
all the time in Phys-Ed.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.925
I've had, like, seven in my
life. Do I look any different?

16:06.925 --> 16:10.428
No, I'm fine. You recover.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.514
How does he...how do you take
a pass like this? Who does that?

16:13.514 --> 16:16.100
Who walks around like this when
a Mac truck's coming at you.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.646
[music]

16:19.646 --> 16:23.399
[Jimmy] Hey, sir, I heard you
labelled some grade five kid
in floor hockey today.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.360
You know what, Jimmy?
He ran into me. Okay?

16:26.360 --> 16:29.530
'Cause if I wanted to label
him I would have labelled
him into the next room.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.867
Yeah, I bet. Must have weighed,
what? Like 85 pounds?

16:32.867 --> 16:34.076
I heard he has a concussion.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.745
He doesn't have a
concussion, Maya.

16:35.745 --> 16:39.248
Maybe you should pick
on people your own size.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.584
Okay, everybody stand up!
And please move the desks.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.920
Everybody stand up,
slide the desks.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.423
Yeah! There we go.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.721
You're all my size, so who
wants to see if they can
knock me over?

16:53.721 --> 16:55.264
-Are you serious?
-[Gerry] I'm serious.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.016
-Sir, this is ridiculous.
-You're crazy.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.268
You ask a lot of questions,
Maya, why don't you go first?

16:59.268 --> 17:02.062
You can just stand there
and run at me and see if
you can knock me over.

17:02.062 --> 17:06.317
-What? No!
-I didn't think so.

17:09.988 --> 17:14.283
I'll go first, sir.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.744
Haha, Leonard.
Crazy Leondard.

17:16.744 --> 17:21.833
Haha, you.
Alright, back to work.

17:21.833 --> 17:26.921
Oh, isn 't Leonard
being a silly guy?

17:26.921 --> 17:28.840
And that brings us back
to the main entrance.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.967
Where I come to greet the
students almost every morning.

17:30.967 --> 17:35.471
-Hi.
-Is this one of your staff?

17:35.471 --> 17:39.225
Ah, yes, this is
Trudy, she likes..

17:39.225 --> 17:43.145
-And this would be?
-A homeless man, I presume.

17:43.145 --> 17:49.903
Mr. Malik. I make
sure school is clean.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.822
-Oh my god. What are you doing?
-It was my day off.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.951
So you decided to come back
to the school, on your day off,
dressed like the King of Pop?

17:56.951 --> 17:58.912
Who?

17:58.912 --> 18:04.083
This is ridiculous. Mr. Dwyer,
thank god, would you...

18:04.083 --> 18:08.212
-That's not Mr. Dwyer.
-That's an honest mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.632
-If you're a racist.
-Maybe you could
leave that part out.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.052
Hey, quick picture.

18:14.052 --> 18:18.222
-I don't even know if we need...
-[camera clicks]

18:18.222 --> 18:20.975
-Oh yeah, that's it.
-Looks great.

18:20.975 --> 18:24.812
Watch this.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.231
There you are, Cameron.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.359
Alright. You're early,
getting ready. Stretching.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.571
Good to see. 'Cause we're
going to beat that score.

18:33.571 --> 18:36.824
Awesome, I was practicing
at home, so you know...
getting ready.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.411
-Perfect. Alright, so I want
you to get up there.
-[Cameron] Okay.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.038
I want you to fight
the pain you're feeling.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.749
And I need you to stay up
there longer than .2 seconds.

18:44.749 --> 18:48.086
Okay? We're going
to believe in ourself.
We're going to be confident.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.879
And we're going to start
to get you in better shape.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.464
That's what we're going to do.
It starts today!

18:51.464 --> 18:54.133
-Okay?
-Okay, you got your
stop watch ready?

18:54.133 --> 18:57.845
I've got my stop watch ready.
Alright, we're going to
beat .2 seconds, right?

18:57.845 --> 19:00.347
-Yeah.
-I'm going to pull the chair,
you pull yourself up.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.809
And I know you're going to do
well. And you believe that.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.019
And you don't quit.
And you don't come down early.

19:05.019 --> 19:08.064
And you fight it. There's a
little bit of pain, so what?
You fight the pain.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.232
-Do you understand me Cameron?
-Yup.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.819
Ready? I'm excited to see this.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.823
Here we go.
Ready? And...Go!
[stopwatch beeps]

19:16.823 --> 19:20.827
Pull the chair,
Okay...You didn't...

19:20.827 --> 19:26.415
-.3, .3 seconds.
-Awesome! Yes!

19:26.415 --> 19:30.670
.3...Hey, that's a 33%
improvement, right?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.965
So, there you go. All that
practice paid off. Good for you.

19:33.965 --> 19:38.260
You know, I can stand on
one leg for a really
long time, sir.

19:38.260 --> 19:44.142
-Say that again.
-[Cameron] I can stand on one
leg for a really long time.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.144
[Cameron] You want to see?

19:46.144 --> 19:48.855
Why wouldn't I
want to see that?

19:48.855 --> 19:51.357
Wow, look at that.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.610
Look at that. Oh, well now
you're kind of cheating,
you're holding on there.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.864
-So that's...
-[Cameron] Not really.

19:57.864 --> 20:03.161
Look at that.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.038
-You're a pelican.
-See ya, sir.

-[Gerry] See ya later, Cameron.

20:10.835 --> 20:14.672
Sorry, I'm late, Jake.
Oh gosh, crazy day.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.966
And I apologize for forgetting
to meet with you the other day.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.678
I know Mr. Hunt wanted you
to speak to me because
you have ADD, I have ADD.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.931
-So, I am here.
-That's fine, I understand
that you're busy.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.017
We're all busy, but I need
to make more time for students.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.895
This is an example of someone
that's living with ADD.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.106
Something I live with everyday
and I want to help you.

20:32.106 --> 20:36.736
I just need to go to the
washroom, okay? Be right back.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.122
[Gerry] Oh, come on.
Who does this?

20:48.122 --> 20:52.501
Are you kidding me?

20:57.131 --> 20:58.465
[Gerry sighs]

21:00.426 --> 21:04.138
You gotta
be kidding me right now.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.975
You gotta be kidding.
