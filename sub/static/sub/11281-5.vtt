CHRIS ROCK:
When I was 15,

00:05.339 --> 00:06.707
the only thing I wanted
more than a girlfriend

00:06.740 --> 00:08.142
was to have some privacy.

00:08.176 --> 00:11.512
I didn't have a room to
myself, somebody was always
home,

00:11.545 --> 00:13.514
and even when I was supposed
to be alone...

00:13.547 --> 00:16.584
somebody was there.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.654
Sometimes I hate going home.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.723
It's like I can never
be alone.
Me, too.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.825
Every time I turn around,
my grandma's right there.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.395
She thinks "alone" is
something you get at a bank.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.297
Whenever I turn around,
my whole family is right there.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.265
What would you do
if you had privacy?

00:31.299 --> 00:32.800
* Been working all week
for the money I got *

00:32.833 --> 00:35.469
* Looking for a place
to spend this nut... *

00:35.503 --> 00:38.539
Nothing much, just do whatever
I want, whenever I want.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.409
I can't wait till I get
my own place.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.444
Well, my grandma
has the flu,

00:43.477 --> 00:44.845
and I have to make her
some hot toddies.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.614
Hot toddies
are sick people's happy hour.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.483
Who cares about the flu
when you're drunk?

00:50.551 --> 00:53.221
Mom, I'm home.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.325
JULIUS:
Uh, hello

00:57.358 --> 00:59.293
What's going on?

00:59.327 --> 01:00.494
Baby, we're all sick.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.397
So I quarantined the
rest of the house

01:03.431 --> 01:05.133
so you're just going to
have to stay over there.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.168
But where am I supposed
to eat and sleep

01:07.201 --> 01:08.636
and go to the bathroom?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.771
Well, baby, you can
sleep on the couch.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.507
And then you can eat free
sloppers over at Doc's.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.809
And I left you a bucket.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.179
Great, what do I do
when the bucket is full?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.850
Rochelle, this is crazy.

01:22.883 --> 01:26.587
First of all, you used
$3.97 worth of plastic wrap.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.589
Second,
Chris can't live like this.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.191
I called Mr. Omar.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.592
He can stay upstairs
with him.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.161
Oh, no, he can't go up there

01:33.194 --> 01:35.129
with all them loose women
coming and going.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.597
Yes, he can.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.432
Mr. Omar promised
he'd be on his best behavior.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.667
Chris will be fine.

01:40.734 --> 01:41.902
Julius, I don't know about this.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.638
Look, either way, we ain't
wasting this much plastic wrap.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.241
So, you might as well
send him up to Omar's.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.280
You gotta go
upstairs, baby.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.814
All I knew about Mr. Omar

01:53.847 --> 01:56.550
was that he liked dead men
and live women.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.918
So, I didn't know
what to expect.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.420
All right, now, Chris,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.189
there's a few things
you need to understand.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.457
Phone rings, you take a message.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.394
Don't go looking for nothing
you ain't supposed to find.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.862
And most importantly,
I need my privacy.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.765
So, you stay out of my way,
and I stay out of yours.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.501
Deal?
Deal.
Good.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.769
I'll be back later,
so you're on your own.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.445
Now all I needed was
six white girls and a monkey.

02:24.478 --> 02:28.516

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

02:58.879 --> 03:00.648
Dude, this is so awesome.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.250
You got your own
bachelor pad.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.684
Yeah, it's great,
besides the fact

03:03.717 --> 03:04.885
that there's an old man
that lives there.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.555
Yeah, but he's not an old man
that tells you what to do.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.789
You're like Fonzie living
upstairs on Happy Days.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.358
:
Ey...

03:10.391 --> 03:11.525
You know, this will be
the first time

03:11.559 --> 03:13.394
I actually have some privacy.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.529
Whenever I want privacy, my dad
tells me to go in the backyard.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.831
So, Chris,
you got your own place?

03:17.865 --> 03:18.699
Yeah, do you?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.501
Oh, yeah,
I got a flat in the city.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.902
Where's your parents?

03:21.935 --> 03:24.638
Is that your business?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.474
Where's your place, Chris?

03:26.507 --> 03:27.941
Upstairs at my parents' house.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.743
Dude, that's not your own place.
That's the attic.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.979
Oh, and I have a quiz tomorrow
on chapter seven.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.282
Either I pass it,
or it's your ass.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.651
It's not my ass's fault
you suck at math.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.761
Oh, man, I just
threw up buckets.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.730
Ow!

03:49.763 --> 03:52.032
Why are you faking a fever?
Because I forgot

03:52.065 --> 03:54.302
to study for my math quiz,
and I don't want to get an "F."

03:54.335 --> 03:57.738
If Mama finds out you aren't
sick, she's going to kill you.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.307
If I get an "F,"
Mama will kill me.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.574
So why don't you mind
your own business?

04:00.608 --> 04:02.543
ROCHELLE:
Drew.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.445
I'm in here.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.447
Boy, what are you
doing out of bed?

04:06.480 --> 04:07.781
I had to throw up.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.283
:
Go on back to bed.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.851
I'll check on you
in a few minutes.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.425
Girl, you are burning up.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.059
This is bad.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.395
It was a big deal
for Tonya to have the flu,

04:21.429 --> 04:22.963
because she never got sick.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.699
Not even when we got polio.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.578
I'm calling the doctor.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.513
For what?

04:39.547 --> 04:42.516
We're all sick, Julius,
remember?

04:42.550 --> 04:45.553
And now Tonya has a fever.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.820
We've all got fevers.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.956
Besides, doctors
cost money.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.824
And so do funerals.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.693
Look, all the doctor
is going to say

04:52.726 --> 04:54.595
is that we need
to get some rest,

04:54.628 --> 04:57.331
drink plenty of fluids,
take some aspirin.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.899
We don't need
to pay for that.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.869
I can't believe your daughter
is in there burning up

05:01.902 --> 05:04.772
and you are too cheap
to call the doctor.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.775
Call Chris, tell him to
bring us some 'Tussin.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.443
We'll be okay.

05:11.479 --> 05:14.682
Staying at Mr. Omar's was kind
of like sharing a bachelor pad.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.417
With a dirty old bachelor.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.785
Oh, hey, Chris.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.720
Just getting in
from a little afternoon delight?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.989
Oh, no, I just had to drop off
some 'Tussin downstairs.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.024
You know,
flu season to me

05:24.057 --> 05:25.826
is like tax season
for accountants.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.861
That's when I do
the most business.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.630
But I'm sure your
family will be fine.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.499
Well, thanks.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.866
So, what's for dinner?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.802
I'm having mac and cheese.
What are you having?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.437
I guess I'll have
mac and cheese, too.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.440
You must be having it someplace
else, 'cause I'm all out.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.777
Well, what else you got?

05:43.811 --> 05:46.380
Uh, whatever's
in the fridge.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.149
What?!

05:49.182 --> 05:50.951
Man, do you know
you have hair in here.

05:50.984 --> 05:54.021
Oh, I know, that's
my side business.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.157
My dear clients no longer have
a need for their tresses--

05:57.190 --> 05:59.693
tragic-- so I sell it
to wig shops.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.061
I got a wide variety.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.631
I got curly, wavy,
nappy, and Indian.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.933
Who wants nappy?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.736
The only other thing
you have in here

06:08.769 --> 06:11.171
is some expired milk,
some prune juice...

06:11.204 --> 06:12.973
and what is this?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.976
Oh, I do have some cheese.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.413
Now all we need is the macaroni.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.182
Back at home, Tonya was trying
to fake not freezing to death.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.553
Daddy, I'm cold.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.820
That means
it's working.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.922
Here, keep this
on your forehead.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.725
Rochelle, what does
the thermometer say?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.528
Two below zero.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.464
Julius, you're giving her
the chills.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.865
I can cure the chills.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.033
My mother had a home remedy
for the chills.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.702
It's called a blanket.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.204
I tried your mother's chill
remedy, and it gave me a rash.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.039
Did you brew it overnight
and strain it

06:46.073 --> 06:47.040
through an old tube sock?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.009
No.
Well, that's why.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.544
If you let me I make it
the right way,

06:50.578 --> 06:51.812
then she'll feel
as good as new.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.681
What's that for?

06:53.714 --> 06:57.551
So I can come back and get this
food before it thaws out.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.119
I'm going
to make the remedy.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.121
A little butter and onions

07:01.154 --> 07:04.191
and Tonya would make
a nice side dish.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.897
Why don't you just tell them
you're not really sick?

07:09.930 --> 07:13.567
You know Dad's home remedies
are nasty.

07:13.601 --> 07:17.037
Not as nasty as Mama.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.608
(TV playing quietly,
toilet flushing)

07:20.641 --> 07:23.176
Well, I'm going to bed.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.945
So what time do you want me
to turn off the lights?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.179
Oh, I don't care.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.848
You can stay up all night
if you want.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.984
And there's some videos over
there you're welcome to watch.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.019
I've got
Night of the Living Dead,

07:32.052 --> 07:33.086
Dawn of the Dead,
Day of the Dead,

07:33.120 --> 07:35.956
Dead Zone,
Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,

07:35.989 --> 07:38.091
Death in Venice, Death Wish,

07:38.125 --> 07:40.528
Love and Death,
Murder by Death,

07:40.561 --> 07:43.597
and Ososhiki aka Death,
Japanese Style.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.065
Cool, thanks.

07:50.738 --> 07:54.908
Turns out Mr. Omar only had one
movie that wasn't about death.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.678
Richard Pryor: Live in Concert.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.116
PRYOR:
How are you?

08:03.150 --> 08:06.654
Thank you. Ooh.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.256
Thank you. Thank you much.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.525
Good evening.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.094
Wait for the people
to get from the bathroom.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.730
People in there ...

08:20.968 --> 08:22.736
What's happening, blood?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.071
Right on.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.108
The white people, rushing back.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.112
White people don't care...

08:34.347 --> 08:36.283
Chris.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.618
Chris.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.919
Chris?!
What?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.088
What time are you going
to be home from school?

08:41.121 --> 08:43.691
Like, 5:00. Why?

08:43.724 --> 08:45.158
Can you make it midnight?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.661
No. I'm a kid,
I can't stay out that late.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.162
Hmm. Yeah,
you got a point.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.098
Well, in that case,
I won't be home tonight.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.666
Where are you
going to be?

08:52.700 --> 08:53.734
Minding my own business.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.202
Are you going
to be okay?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.037
Even though I had never
been on my own before,

08:57.070 --> 08:59.740
it was my first chance
to have some real privacy,

08:59.773 --> 09:01.742
and I wasn't going
to pass it up.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.043
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Good.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.145
Don't forget to lock up
after you leave.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.880
Oh...

09:06.914 --> 09:08.616
let's keep this
between you and me, okay?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.250
I wouldn't want your parents
to find out

09:10.283 --> 09:11.284
I left you here alone.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.086
No problem.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.290
Aren't you supposed to be
at school or something?

09:17.324 --> 09:20.060
Yeah, I don't have to leave
till, like, 7:30.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.228
What time is it?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.730
8:45.

09:22.763 --> 09:26.099
8:45 was a quarter past
late as hell.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.241
"Four score and seven years ago,

09:34.274 --> 09:37.945
"our forefathers brought forth
on this continent

09:37.978 --> 09:41.314
"a new nation
conceived in liberty

09:41.348 --> 09:43.851
"and dedicated
to the proposition

09:43.884 --> 09:47.254
that all men
are created equal..."

09:47.287 --> 09:50.157
even if they're on CP time.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.892
Good morning, Chris.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.260
Good morning, Ms. Morello.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.729
I'm sorry I'm late,
but my whole family is sick.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.197
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.

09:57.230 --> 10:00.768
Is it sickle cell, rickets,
or swine flu?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.636
Is that like chitlin

10:02.670 --> 10:03.937
Swine flu.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.674
Your tardiness is excused,

10:06.707 --> 10:11.278
but you should tell your family
to lay off the bacon.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.848
For a guy who's never had
.a place to himself,

10:14.882 --> 10:17.317
Greg had a lot of ideas
about what I should do.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.052
Do you know
what this means?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.121
You're in possession
of the velvet trap.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.056
Velvet trap?
What does catch?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.291
Don't you know
who likes velvet?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.159
Prince?

10:26.193 --> 10:28.228
Him, too? But I was
talking about girls.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.997
Girls like velvet.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.399
Velvet...
What are you talking about?

10:32.432 --> 10:34.067
Your apartment-- velvet.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.268
You've got a place.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.337
Now all you need
to do is get a girl.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.206
You're so in there.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.008
I can't imagine what I'd do
if I had a place to myself.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.009
I could.

10:42.042 --> 10:49.049
* All by myself

10:49.082 --> 10:50.317
* Don't wanna be...

10:50.350 --> 10:51.819
Guess I am in there.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.186
You're so in there,

10:53.220 --> 10:54.955
we'd have to send
a search party
to find you.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.290
And I think I know exactly
who I want to be in there with.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.325
Who?

10:58.358 --> 11:00.761
Tasha.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.030
Who needs a test tube
to make medicine

11:03.063 --> 11:05.032
when you've got a tube sock.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.900
Okay, Doctor,
thank you.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.335
I'll mail you a check.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.706
So what did he say?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.307
You were right, okay.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.009
Now, is this remedy of yours
going to work?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.110
Oh, it'll work.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.979
It's been passed down
for generations.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.748
My mother got it
from my grandmother

11:20.781 --> 11:21.949
who got it from her
great grandmother

11:21.982 --> 11:23.316
who got it
from a Puerto Rican lady.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.953
My father's home remedies were
legendary.

11:25.986 --> 11:26.987
If you had a headache...

11:27.020 --> 11:29.957
Baking soda and a pomegranate.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.258
If you were nauseous...

11:31.291 --> 11:33.794
Catfish and grape jelly.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.162
If you were blind...

11:35.195 --> 11:36.463
A tin cup and a white cane.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.699
Hey, he couldn't cure
everything.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.271
Oh, good Lord!

11:44.304 --> 11:46.239
Man, what's in this
stuff

11:46.273 --> 11:48.776
Don't be silly.
It's strawberry turpentine.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.246
Ah, that's working.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.784
Tonya went from healthy kid
to guinea pig.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.485
Eww, it stinks!

11:58.518 --> 11:59.920
Smells like feet.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.254
Be quiet, boy.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.522
I know it smells bad,

12:02.555 --> 12:05.058
but if you drink it,
you'll feel better.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.227
Why don't you drink it?

12:07.260 --> 12:08.929
But, baby, we only had
enough ingredients

12:08.962 --> 12:10.363
for your daddy
to make one dose,

12:10.397 --> 12:12.866
and since you're
the sickest, it's yours.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.168
And you are still sick,
aren't you?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.978
Yeah, you'll feel
better in no time.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.914
Especially since there was
nothing wrong with her

12:26.947 --> 12:29.282
in the first place.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.218
Since my velvet trap was set,

12:31.251 --> 12:33.520
all I needed to do was dangle
the bait.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.456
Hey, Chris, what's wrong?

12:36.489 --> 12:38.826
My whole family's got
the flu.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.927
That's too bad.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.895
Are you okay?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.063
Yeah, 'cause I'm staying
at Mr. Omar's.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.397
For real?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.833
Yeah, he's staying over
at a friend's,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.500
so I have the whole place
to myself.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.937
I wish I could get away
from my grandma.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.840
Do you like Richard Pryor?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.541
I love Richard Pryor.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.811
But I'm not allowed
to watch him.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.980
That's too bad
because Mr. Omar...

13:00.013 --> 13:01.514
he has one of his concert tapes.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.216
He does?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.551
I was going to ask if can come
watch it with me,

13:04.584 --> 13:07.888
but I don't want to get you
in trouble.

13:07.921 --> 13:08.956
I can come.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.257
You can?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.092
I learned early on
that the best way

13:12.125 --> 13:13.593
to get a girl into trouble

13:13.626 --> 13:16.864
is to tell her you don't want
to get her into trouble.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.366
Yeah, I'll meet you
around 8:00.
Okay.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.303
I had a place, I had a girl,

13:23.336 --> 13:27.107
I had a smile so wide that you
could see it from behind.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.176
Mm-hmm.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.343
Which tape is it?

13:30.377 --> 13:33.380
Richard Pryor: Live in Concert.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.915
Richard Pryor, huh?

13:34.948 --> 13:37.384
That's a good one!

13:37.417 --> 13:39.386
Hey, little dude,
let me hold that tape.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.255
I would, but I'm watching it
again tonight.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.157
Man, I brought home
a Richard Pryor album,

13:44.191 --> 13:45.525
my mother wouldn't even let me
in the house.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.095
What you know
about Richard Pryor, youngblood?

13:48.128 --> 13:49.596
I know he's funnier than you.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.931
Whoa!
Ooh!

13:50.964 --> 13:52.532
Let me tell you something,
youngblood.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.935
You ain't too young to meet
the executioner.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.303
You sure you wanna do that?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.038
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

13:58.071 --> 14:00.340
The only thing
we cut here is hair. All right?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.909
Show him
what I taught you.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.211
Show him. Show him!

14:04.244 --> 14:06.013
Anyway, I'm not even
staying in my house.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.214
I'm staying at Mr. Omar's.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.150
Mr. Omar?
What you doing up there?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.219
My whole family's sick;
they got the flu.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.054
Sick? They in
the hospital?

14:14.087 --> 14:15.889
No.
Damn!

14:15.923 --> 14:17.290
He was gonna rob my house.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.926
You said they had
the flu, right?

14:18.959 --> 14:21.228
Now, I got the cure
for the flu right here.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.095
You should've asked me earlier.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.965
Here you go;
check that out right there.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.133
Does it work?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.200
Oh, it worked for me.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.969
Me too.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.238
It even stopped my
hallucinations for a... while.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.539
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Charlie, where you going?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.408
Come back, man.
I need to borrow
five dollars.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.276
You see that, man?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.145
Look, you tell them
to take one teaspoon

14:38.178 --> 14:39.579
one teaspoon,

14:39.612 --> 14:41.081
'cause it'll knock you out
for five hours.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.316
But it works.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.053
Five hours?
Let me hold that bottle.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.287
Are you sick?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.089
N-No.
I didn't think so.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.557
Here you go, Chris, man.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.591
Remember what I said now.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.526
One teaspoon.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.962
You're all done.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.229
Uh! Next!

14:56.263 --> 14:57.430
He gave the same elixir

14:57.464 --> 15:00.167
to people who need to take
paint off of cars.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.569
Hey, man, I was next.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.172
Hey, you want a cut
or get cut.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.074
Huh?

15:07.107 --> 15:08.441
Hey, man, it's your life.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.213
Now, are you sure this is
going to work?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.282
Worked for everybody
on the block.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.584
How many teaspoons do we need
to take?

15:17.617 --> 15:19.352
One or two?

15:19.386 --> 15:20.687
Six.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.389
Six?!

15:22.422 --> 15:24.091
Yeah, six.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.192
I knew that was too much

15:25.225 --> 15:27.427
and I risked putting my family
in a coma,

15:27.460 --> 15:30.230
but I wasn't risking my mother
catching me with a girl.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.671
Freeze!

15:38.705 --> 15:41.508
'Cause I ain't raising
no babies!

15:41.541 --> 15:43.310
Kool-Aid's gone Rambo.

15:43.343 --> 15:47.180
Are you eating and sleeping
and going to school on time?

15:47.214 --> 15:49.449
Yeah, Ma, I'm fine.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.384
And how is
Mr. Omar treating you?

15:51.418 --> 15:53.520
You guys getting along okay?

15:53.553 --> 15:56.289
Yeah, it's like
he's not even there.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.524
Good.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.560
Well, I hope this stuff works.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.030
Me too.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.102
I had a girl fixed up
and I got my hair fixed up.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.605
Now I needed to get Mr. Omar's
apartment fixed up.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.674
*

16:21.414 --> 16:25.385
*

16:36.263 --> 16:38.365
Hi.
Hi.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.532
Thanks for inviting me.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.568
This should be fun.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.204
Being alone with Tasha was
like a dream come true.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.474
I'd jump for joy if I wasn't
paralyzed with fear.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.775
Aren't you going
to come sit down?

16:48.808 --> 16:51.211
Oh, yeah. Sure.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.746
Just wanted to make sure
you got a good spot.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.085
So, what are
you waiting for?

16:58.118 --> 16:59.586
Put it in.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.088
Huh?
What?!

17:01.121 --> 17:03.756
The tape, Chris--
put in the Richard Pryor tape.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.225
Oh, yeah.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.661
Who's that?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.797
I don't know.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.302
I had worked to make this
the perfect night,

17:15.335 --> 17:16.836
nothing could ruin it...

17:16.869 --> 17:19.206
ALL:
Hey!

17:19.239 --> 17:20.307
...except this.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.143
We're here, youngblood.
We're here.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.614
Hey, man, why don't you
check and see

17:27.647 --> 17:29.749
if they got something to drink
in the refrigerator?

17:29.782 --> 17:31.418
Hey, put the tape on,
little dude.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.653
Hey, get of here, big dude.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.261
Thanks.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.696
Hello. I'd like to make
a collect call to Kansas City.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.466
I had a place to myself
and the girl of my dreams.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.202
But two things messed it up:
me and my big mouth.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.770
You weren't going to sit here,
were you?

17:50.803 --> 17:53.240
Nah, man. It's okay.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.309
Remember when you told me
not to run?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.715
Man, thanks
for inviting us
over, Chris.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.417
I didn't invite you over.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.219
Hey, man, you aren't trying
to talk to Tasha, are you?

18:06.253 --> 18:07.454
Yeah, kind of.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.521
Well, if that's
the case, man,

18:08.555 --> 18:09.756
why don't you just
give me the say-so.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.358
I'll clear these people
out of here in seconds.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.293
See, I carry a container
of napalm,

18:13.326 --> 18:14.361
just for such emergencies.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.729
I was tempted
to take him up on it.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.669
I wasn't really running...

18:25.272 --> 18:26.573
Hey, hey!

18:26.606 --> 18:29.242
Hey, can y'all
kind of keep it down,

18:29.276 --> 18:31.511
'cause everyone downstairs is
trying to sleep.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.350
Not everybody.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.688
What are you doing up here?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.156
What are you doing up here?

18:43.190 --> 18:44.691
I thought
you were sick.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.627
Didn't you take
the medicine?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.662
I spit it out.
Where's Mr. Omar?

18:49.696 --> 18:50.563
He had to leave.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.631
He left you here alone?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.366
Yeah.
And you didn't
tell Momma?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.767
No.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.270
There you are.
Bye, Chris.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.805
You're leaving?
Yeah.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.640
Wait.

19:00.673 --> 19:01.941
I can't. I have to get home
before my grandmother wakes up.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.576
But I had a lot of fun, though.
Thanks.

19:03.610 --> 19:10.850
* Tell me, how am I supposed
to live without you? *

19:10.883 --> 19:13.220
The girl of my dreams was
walking away,

19:13.253 --> 19:16.956
but the girl of my nightmares
wasn't going anywhere.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.358
I know, I know--

19:18.391 --> 19:20.960
Ooh, you're telling.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.429
Get in there.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.231
Now. Go.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.234
I don't like...
Shut up.

19:27.267 --> 19:31.938
Even in a coma,
my mother could sense trouble.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.940
I started out wanting
to get a little privacy

19:33.973 --> 19:35.775
and ended up with a disaster.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.245
And at that moment,
I wished for anything

19:38.278 --> 19:39.512
to get me out of that mess...

19:39.546 --> 19:42.349
What is going on in here?!

19:42.382 --> 19:44.384
...except this.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.418
You better start looking,

19:45.452 --> 19:46.886
'cause obviously
you lost your mind.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.688
Upstairs party
while we're down here...

19:48.721 --> 19:50.623
After my mother got through
with me...

19:50.657 --> 19:53.293
Tonya...

19:53.326 --> 19:54.894
and Mr. Omar...

19:54.927 --> 19:58.231
I realized that having privacy
and being independent

19:58.265 --> 20:00.300
isn't all it's cracked up
.to be.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.802
But at least she didn't
find out about Tasha.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.003
Chris!!!

20:04.036 --> 20:08.308
What is this I hear about you
having some girl upstairs?

20:08.341 --> 20:11.811
* Everybody Hates Chris...

20:13.646 --> 20:16.516
