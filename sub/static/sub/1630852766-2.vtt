<i> He wasn't necessarily</i>
<i> cancelable, so to speak.</i>

39:27.165 --> 39:28.765
<i> It was strictly for me</i>

39:28.867 --> 39:31.801
so I wouldn't feel bound
to be living this lie

39:31.903 --> 39:34.838
where I constantly
have to say things were great

39:34.940 --> 39:36.940
when I was there
when they weren't.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.913
<i> What I love about my book</i>

39:44.015 --> 39:46.549
<i> is I feel some people</i>
<i> are finding it</i>

39:46.651 --> 39:49.786
<i> and they read it and they</i>
<i> recognize parallel situations</i>

39:49.888 --> 39:51.287
in emotionally
abusive relationships

39:51.390 --> 39:52.589
that they might be in.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.357
I've heard a lot of feedback
like that.

39:54.459 --> 39:58.294
And I love it that people are
talking about abuses of power

39:58.397 --> 40:01.297
and imbalances
in relationships.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.334
And I hope that helps
some people.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.871
- We are currently in an era

40:07.973 --> 40:10.340
where we're breaking down
that wall of misogyny.

40:10.442 --> 40:14.310
<i> Hef was able to control women</i>

40:14.413 --> 40:18.681
under the disguise
of his money and power.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.216
- Yeah, for sure.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.453
<i> - Holly madison got money,</i>
<i> got fame,</i>

40:23.555 --> 40:25.755
<i> got everything she wanted.</i>

40:25.857 --> 40:29.092
So I'm worried that holly will
just cause a lot of eyerolling

40:29.194 --> 40:31.528
and therefore people won't
really take this seriously.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.165
<i> - When holly</i>
<i> was his girlfriend,</i>

40:35.267 --> 40:36.800
<i> he was old by then.</i>

40:36.902 --> 40:40.236
<i> Hef was a lot younger</i>
<i> when I started dating him.</i>

40:40.338 --> 40:44.340
<i> My experiences with him</i>
<i> got pretty scary at times.</i>

40:44.443 --> 40:46.342
- We love you, hef!

40:46.445 --> 40:49.312
<i> - Didn't matter how many</i>
<i> people you brought in--</i>

40:49.414 --> 40:51.114
<i> it would only satisfy him</i>
<i> for the moment</i>

40:51.216 --> 40:53.416
and then he'd have to find
something bigger,

40:53.518 --> 40:55.552
better, naughtier.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.153
He was like a vampire.

40:57.255 --> 41:00.824
He sucked the life out of all
these young girls for decades.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.693
<i> - If those rocks could talk,</i>
<i> the tales they would tell.</i>

41:05.030 --> 41:07.363
<i> - I know some really</i>
<i> deep dark secrets.</i>

41:07.466 --> 41:09.165
- I can't give this up.

41:09.267 --> 41:12.869
- And now we're speaking up.
It's all gonna come out.
