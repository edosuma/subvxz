00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.377 --> 00:12.511
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.513 --> 00:14.780
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.782 --> 00:17.516
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.518 --> 00:19.852
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.854 --> 00:22.488
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.490 --> 00:25.357
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.359 --> 00:29.328
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.330 --> 00:33.365
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.367 --> 00:36.368
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.370 --> 00:38.037
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.039 --> 00:40.472
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.474 --> 00:42.875
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.877 --> 00:45.377
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.379 --> 00:51.550
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

00:58.659 --> 01:01.326
Where is everyone?

01:01.328 --> 01:02.728
Sorry I'm late
for game night.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.363
I was practicing derby
and lost track of time.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.532
Mm-hmm.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.034
I guess the rest of the family
lost track of time, too.

01:09.036 --> 01:11.270
I'll go see what's
holding your father up.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.240
And I'll go find
Amber and James.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.942
Can our first game be
Who Am I?

01:16.944 --> 01:18.744
I've been working on
my Cedric impression.

01:18.746 --> 01:22.181
- "Merlin's mushrooms!"
- ( laughing )

01:25.386 --> 01:28.053
Amber, what are you doing?
It's game night, remember?

01:28.055 --> 01:29.922
Oh! I completely forgot.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.391
I got so caught up
redesigning my closet.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.926
So what do you think
of this?

01:33.928 --> 01:36.195
I want to install
a mini-planetarium

01:36.197 --> 01:37.896
so I can look at the stars

01:37.898 --> 01:40.399
and choose a stylish outfit
at the same time!

01:40.401 --> 01:43.302
Great idea,
but Mom's waiting.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.437
Right. ( gasps )

01:45.439 --> 01:47.573
Hold on.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.142
My telescope can double
as my hat rack.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.577
I'll tell Mom
you're coming in a bit?

01:51.579 --> 01:53.912
Yes, yes,
I'll be right there.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.380
Thanks, Sofia!

02:02.256 --> 02:04.256
- Halt!
- Why?

02:04.258 --> 02:07.259
My knights are on a quest
to rescue King Ashford,

02:07.261 --> 02:09.094
and you're about
to smoosh the king.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.662
Oh, sorry.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.065
But it's great you're
excited about playing a game,

02:13.067 --> 02:15.567
because Mom wants us all
in the family room
for game night.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.169
This is no game, Sofia.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.638
This is a brave
and daring quest.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.607
Can you tell Mom
I'll be there soon?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.842
( sighs )
Sure.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.649
Roland, are you ready
for game night?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.651
Oh! Is it that time
already?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.987
The royal builder and I
are designing a new castle

02:34.989 --> 02:36.488
as a gift for the elves,

02:36.490 --> 02:39.124
and I've been having a blast
making these turrets.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.026
But it's game night.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.629
Uh... Miranda?

02:43.631 --> 02:45.631
What is it?

02:45.633 --> 02:47.833
Would you mind if I quickly
built the great hall?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.301
And then you'll
come to game night.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.769
As soon as I'm finished.

02:50.771 --> 02:51.904
Oh, goody.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.609
I guess they're
not coming.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.611
I guess not.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.813
Sofia, can you remember
the last time

03:01.815 --> 03:03.549
we all did something
together as a family?

03:03.551 --> 03:06.718
Well, we had breakfast
together today.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.354
Oh, wait. Amber was at
an astronomy club meeting.

03:09.356 --> 03:13.125
What about
the all-kingdom tea yesterday?

03:13.127 --> 03:17.496
No. Dad was interviewing
a new court jester.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.131
I guess it has
been a while.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.699
I mean, don't get me wrong.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.502
I'm glad we all have
hobbies and school
and exciting jobs,

03:23.504 --> 03:26.171
but spending time together
is important, too.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.173
It would just be nice
if we could all get

03:28.175 --> 03:29.975
some quality time
as a family,

03:29.977 --> 03:31.910
away from our work
and hobbies.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.712
What if we go somewhere
together,

03:33.714 --> 03:35.581
on a vacation?

03:35.583 --> 03:38.517
We could take a ski trip,
or go boating.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.186
Ooh! Or go to the royal
elephant rain forest.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.989
I've always wanted to see
the flying elephants there.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.757
That sounds fantastic, Mom.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.260
I think so, too.
I'll book a trip
right away.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.095
This is just what
the family needs.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.496
Great idea, Sofia.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.703
To the coach,
everyone.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.571
Our family vacation
awaits!

03:59.573 --> 04:00.939
Yay!

04:00.941 --> 04:02.341
( gasps )

04:02.343 --> 04:04.776
We're taking the new
cloud coaster?

04:04.778 --> 04:08.714
My engineers say
it's a horseless,
steam-powered dynamo.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.716
But from the look of it,
I agree.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.351
Mom thought you'd
wanna drive it.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.586
And right you are,
my queen.

04:18.592 --> 04:22.127
I've been dying to take
this baby out for a spin.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.630
Oh. Not so fast,
you two.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.531
Remember, we're going
on a vacation

04:26.533 --> 04:28.567
to be together.
No distractions.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.370
But without these,
how do you expect
us to have fun?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.971
By spending time
with each other.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.607
All right, fine.
Here.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.546
Now then,
is everyone ready?

04:41.548 --> 04:44.683
Just a few more pieces of
luggage to pack, Your Majesties.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.689
- I hope we didn't
over-pack.
- Of course I did.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.597
There! All set.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.867
Have a wonderful trip,
and drive safely, Your Majesty.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.906
All right then.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.308
Off we go!

05:17.518 --> 05:20.686
Hey, Dad, remind me,
how long is this vacation again?

05:20.688 --> 05:24.022
- Five days.
- Which will be
very relaxing.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.757
It'll be fantastic.

05:25.759 --> 05:29.294
Mother, um, what do you say
we cut the vacation to...

05:29.296 --> 05:31.196
one night?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.832
I really wanna get back
to my closet remodeling.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.702
And my knights were just about
to vanquish the dragons.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.670
Come on. We're going to have
a great time together.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.272
Did I tell you?

05:40.274 --> 05:42.674
We're going to see
flying elephants.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.377
Plus, this vacation brochure
says there will also be

05:45.379 --> 05:47.612
macaws, ocelots,
sloths even.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.314
Doesn't that sound fun?

05:49.316 --> 05:51.683
Not as fun as
an in-closed planetarium.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.519
And we'll have
our very own tour guide

05:54.521 --> 05:56.855
to show us
the rain forests.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.224
The lodge looks really fancy
and luxurious.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.793
And look, it comes with
its own cruise boat.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.663
A fancy lodge
could be nice.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.732
And a cruise boat sounds
pretty okay, too.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.868
This will be the best family
vacation we've ever taken.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.370
( squeals )
Can't wait.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.506
Now let's kick in
some extra flying horsepower

06:14.508 --> 06:16.541
( all yelling )

06:22.716 --> 06:23.849
Ooh, I think we're here.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.485
Yes, the lodge should be
coming up soon.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.720
ROLAND: There it is.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.555
It looks like a little...

06:30.557 --> 06:32.391
( shudders )
wooden hut.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.826
It probably just looks
small from up here.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.932
( all groan )

06:42.736 --> 06:45.704
Wasn't the lodge supposed
to be fancy and luxurious?

06:45.706 --> 06:49.875
Well, yes, it does look
much fancier in the brochure.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.710
Perhaps it's rustic
on the outside,

06:51.712 --> 06:53.578
but as grand as
a castle on the inside.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.147
Let's take a look.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.921
Think that hole
is supposed to be there?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.190
The brochure does say
the lodge has very sunny rooms.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.792
So there's that.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.094
I think this is
supposed to be
the bedroom.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.896
Oh, hammocks.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.998
How quaint.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.241
Huh? All our luggage
is gone!

07:23.243 --> 07:25.243
Must've fallen out
on the ride here.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.879
But all my clothes...

07:27.881 --> 07:29.047
What am I going to change
into for dinner?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.749
Come on, everyone.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.751
We don't need fancy stuff
and a million outfits

07:32.753 --> 07:34.753
- to have a good time.
- We don't?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.922
No. The only thing we need
is each other.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.590
Your mother's right.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.258
Why don't we go
do something?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.127
Let's go on
an adventure.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.995
Great idea, Sofia.
That'll get us into

07:43.997 --> 07:46.097
- the old vacation spirit,
- ( wood creaking )

07:46.099 --> 07:48.934
and out of this cabin.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.169
Well, I am way
ahead of you.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.306
I booked us on Fabulous Freddy's
Flying Elephant tour.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.775
Our guide Freddy
should be here any minute.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.577
- Sounds great.
- Hey!

08:01.849 --> 08:02.948
What is it?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.817
It's a note from
our tour guide.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.820
Oh. It looks like
Fabulous Freddy
is sick in bed,

08:08.822 --> 08:11.656
and can't take us to see
the flying elephants today.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.525
So what do we do?
Stay here?

08:13.527 --> 08:15.794
Ugh!
Do we have to?

08:15.796 --> 08:18.430
Wait. He sent us a map
of the rain forest.

08:18.432 --> 08:19.798
Oh, and a whistle.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.300
"For herding
flying elephants."

08:22.302 --> 08:24.836
We can go on the flying elephant
tour ourselves.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.638
Why not?
We'll take the raft

08:26.640 --> 08:28.807
I mean, the cruise boat.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.809
Everyone,
up and at 'em.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.979
The first adventure of
our family vacation
is about to start.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.548
What's everyone waiting for?
Come on.

08:40.821 --> 08:41.820
( Amber sighs loudly )

08:41.822 --> 08:44.823
I've been on this raft
for an hour,

08:44.825 --> 08:48.026
and the only wildlife
we've seen are mosquitoes.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.861
Ouch! Oh!

08:49.863 --> 08:51.563
According to this map,

08:51.565 --> 08:54.499
the spider monkey refuge
is right around here.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.835
Spider monkeys.
That will be fun!

08:56.837 --> 08:58.403
If we see any.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.706
My knights could be
saving King Ashford right now.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.644
( gasps )
Oh! A spider monkey!

09:06.914 --> 09:08.980
Let's dock and take
a closer look.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.059
Oh, look, Rolly.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.230
Aw! You're a cute
little fur ball, aren't you?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.101
That was not cute.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.873
JAMES: Ambush!

09:34.875 --> 09:36.875
Hey!

09:36.877 --> 09:38.510
Back on the raft,
everyone.

09:38.512 --> 09:42.447
( monkeys screeching )

09:42.449 --> 09:44.115
Let's go!

09:56.863 --> 09:58.730
Those guys have
good arms.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.098
Hang on!

10:07.874 --> 10:09.474
Is everyone okay?

10:09.476 --> 10:11.109
- SOFIA: Uh-huh.
- JAMES: I guess.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.378
If you don't mind
smelling like mulberries.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.581
I think we can handle
having a few berries
thrown at us, Amber.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.716
Where to next, Sofia?

10:17.718 --> 10:20.151
It's kind of hard to say.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.920
The map is covered
with berry juice.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.588
Just a suggestion, Miranda.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.923
We've been out here
for a while,

10:24.925 --> 10:27.726
we've seen some
adorable spider monkeys.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.961
What do you say
we head back to the lodge

10:29.963 --> 10:31.129
for a little rest?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.131
Fabulous idea, Daddy!

10:33.133 --> 10:35.066
You can turn around
right there.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.435
Wait. Where's your
sense of adventure?

10:37.437 --> 10:39.104
Those monkeys were
a little feisty,

10:39.106 --> 10:41.239
but that's no reason
to turn back.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.909
Mom's right. I still really
wanna see the flying elephants.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.911
I do, too,
so let's go find some.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.947
After that, I promise,
we can head back to the lodge.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.150
I think that sounds
like a reasonable plan.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.786
As long as there are
no spider monkeys, I'm in.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.489
All right.
Fine.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.290
It looks like
the flying elephants

10:59.292 --> 11:01.326
live on the other side
of Parrot Glade,

11:01.328 --> 11:03.128
which is just up ahead.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.829
Pick up that paddle, Rolly.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.564
Let's get to that glade.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.309
All right, everyone.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.046
Time to break in
those hiking boots
and start walking.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.954
Trees, plants,
no flying elephants.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.557
- Can we go now?
- ( squawks ) Can we go now?

11:32.559 --> 11:34.993
( laughing ) We're in
Parrot Glade, all right.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.161
Let's go this way.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.829
PARROT: Let's go this way.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.198
( squawking )

11:40.200 --> 11:42.200
Wait. Which way?

11:42.202 --> 11:45.203
Miranda, which way
did you go?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.839
Miranda, which way
did you go? ( squawk )

11:47.841 --> 11:49.741
Which way did I go?

11:49.743 --> 11:51.342
Which way did I go?
( squawks )

11:51.344 --> 11:53.545
Now where did you go?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.814
Now where did you go?
( squawks )

11:55.816 --> 11:57.582
- ROLAND: Who, me?
- PARROT: Who, me?

11:57.584 --> 12:00.418
- ROLAND: Hey, cut it out.
- PARROT: Hey, cut it out.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.986
I'm getting confused.

12:01.988 --> 12:05.123
Mom, Dad!
Whoa!

12:12.099 --> 12:14.399
Sofia! Mom!

12:14.401 --> 12:17.235
Dad! Whoa.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.138
( straining )

12:25.078 --> 12:27.178
Oh, no. My boots.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.981
We all went in
different directions.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.019
I've got an idea.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.255
Everyone head for that hill
with the arch in the middle.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.590
We'll meet up there.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.226
( squawks )
Meet up there.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.861
- Oh, I see it.
- Me, too.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.863
- On my way.
- Coming.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.097
( whistles )
Coming.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.870
Oh, thank goodness.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.642
I thought I'd be lost
in there forever.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.377
Like my boots.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.380
The map says this is where
the flying elephants should be.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.750
We're not still going
to sightsee, are we?

13:05.752 --> 13:08.153
Look at us.
We're a mess.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.088
Not to mention shoeless.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.291
Oh, I can fix that.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.301
Wow. These are really...

13:23.303 --> 13:25.170
Earthy. Earthy.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.072
Now, we're so close to finding
the flying elephants.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.774
Can't we just stay
a bit longer?

13:29.776 --> 13:32.277
But I don't see
any elephants, Miranda.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.279
Why don't we use
the whistle to call them?

13:34.281 --> 13:35.914
Right.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.552
( blows whistle again )

13:41.788 --> 13:43.655
( sighs )
Still don't see
any elephants.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.123
Neither do I.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.692
- Back to the raft?
- Definitely.

13:47.694 --> 13:50.962
Hold on. Maybe we can spot them
from the top of the hill.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.698
I'll go take a look.
Be right back.

13:58.872 --> 14:02.340
Oh, where are those
flying elephants?

14:02.342 --> 14:06.177
I need to get this vacation
back on track.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.650
Whoo! I made it
up here fine.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.786
Now, elephants.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.221
Elephants. Ugh!

14:16.223 --> 14:18.389
Where are they?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.700
Let's try this again.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.074
( trumpeting )

14:47.387 --> 14:49.053
Everyone run.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.288
Stampede!

14:52.392 --> 14:54.759
- Flying elephants!
- Guess Mom found 'em.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.295
- This way. Come on!
- ( Miranda screaming )

15:04.337 --> 15:05.637
Everyone duck!

15:12.846 --> 15:14.512
SOFIA: Oh, our raft.

15:14.514 --> 15:18.583
Now can we please end
this awful vacation early,

15:18.585 --> 15:20.385
and go home?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.587
I must say,
I second that plan.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.621
I third it.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.291
Oh, yes, okay.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.126
We can go home.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.896
But without the raft, how can
we get back to the lodge?

15:31.898 --> 15:34.198
Well, I suppose
we'll have to walk.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.368
Walk?! Oh, could anything
else go wrong on this trip?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.037
( thunder crashes )

15:41.241 --> 15:43.274
We need to find shelter
before the rain comes.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.310
That looks like
a cave.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.644
MIRANDA: Quick.
Let's go.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.982
Oh, I'm getting soaked!

15:50.984 --> 15:53.051
This is why they
call it the rain forest.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.953
Come on. We're almost
at the cave.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.397
At least it's dry.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.966
Sort of.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.834
It's dry enough to wait out
the storm here.

16:09.836 --> 16:13.404
And from the looks of it,
we may have to wait all night.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.506
Spend the night here?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.408
No, no, no.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.676
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

16:18.678 --> 16:20.678
but I miss that
dusty old lodge.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.480
( wind gusting )

16:22.482 --> 16:24.682
This vacation is
a total failure.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.118
I am so sorry I forced
you all on this trip.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.987
You didn't force us, Mom.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.955
No, no, I did.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.191
No one wanted to come,
but I made you.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.293
Now look at us.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.462
( shivers )
I feel terrible

16:37.464 --> 16:40.465
for putting you all
in this situation.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.401
Wait! I know how
we can warm up.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.538
Let's build a campfire.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.108
Excellent.
I'll gather some tinder.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.511
I'll help, too, Dad.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.987
I'll make us
a seating area.

17:02.989 --> 17:05.423
Even a cave
can have decor.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.395
Smoke.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.497
We have an ember.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.165
- It worked!
- Nice job, Dad.

17:14.167 --> 17:17.001
Mom, come over here
and warm up.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.837
Oh, that does
feel good.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.540
Why is everyone standing
when you can all relax

17:22.542 --> 17:25.743
on your very own
rock ottoman?

17:25.745 --> 17:28.146
Ah! I don't know
about you guys,

17:28.148 --> 17:30.181
but I'm actually
pretty comfy.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.483
- Me, too.
- Not too shabby.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.187
And look. I think I have
something for dinner.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.656
And I have some berries
for dessert.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.998
So... since there's
nothing else to do,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.599
anyone up for game night?

17:48.601 --> 17:51.169
- Okay.
- I guess.
- Why not?

17:51.171 --> 17:52.570
Let's start with
Who Am I?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.205
Oh, I have one.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.541
Okay, who am I?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.443
"Let's make it work."

17:58.445 --> 17:59.844
Baileywick!

17:59.846 --> 18:02.113
Wow, that was spot-on.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.381
( all laughing )

18:03.383 --> 18:04.882
I'll go next.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.018
"Oh, jiggly wiggly pudding.
Great!"

18:07.020 --> 18:08.786
- Dad!
- Daddy!

18:10.623 --> 18:14.158
( laughter )

18:19.532 --> 18:22.266
Ah, the rain
finally stopped.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.469
Well, let's head back
to the lodge.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.404
It's gonna be
a pretty long trek

18:26.406 --> 18:27.972
without the raft.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.273
Oh, no. Look.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.275
( trumpeting )

18:31.277 --> 18:32.810
What do we do?

18:32.812 --> 18:34.178
Run, obviously.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.581
Wait.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.583
Miranda, be careful.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.585
( trumpeting )

18:40.587 --> 18:42.620
Hi.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.655
I know I scared you
last time.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.591
I promise I won't
do it again.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.092
No whistle, see.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.927
( trumpets )

18:49.929 --> 18:51.629
They're friendly.
Really.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.501
I'm James.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.768
Uh, nice to meet you.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.637
- ( trumpets )
- Whoa!

18:59.639 --> 19:01.606
Do you like berries.

19:01.608 --> 19:05.343
Oh, that tickles.
( giggles )

19:05.345 --> 19:08.746
Hm. You're a pretty
magnificent fellow,

19:08.748 --> 19:10.581
when you're not
stampeding us.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.283
Since we're all
friends now,

19:12.285 --> 19:13.985
do you think you could
do us a favor?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.453
Like what?

19:15.455 --> 19:17.588
My family needs to get
back to our lodge,

19:17.590 --> 19:19.524
but since we can't
use our raft,

19:19.526 --> 19:21.359
would you maybe
fly us there?

19:21.361 --> 19:23.327
Well, I don't know.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.696
We had such a tough time
in the rain forest,

19:25.698 --> 19:28.833
and we can really
use the help. Please.

19:28.835 --> 19:32.036
Hold on. Let me
ask my family.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.772
( all trumpeting )

19:39.479 --> 19:42.513
My family says...
let's do it!

19:42.515 --> 19:44.315
Yay!

19:44.317 --> 19:45.850
Come on.
Climb aboard.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.320
- Whoa!
- ALL: Whoa!

19:49.322 --> 19:51.422
Looks like we're
going for a ride.

19:56.563 --> 20:00.031
Wow. This is even better
than the cloud coaster.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.504
Somehow, this rain forest
is so much better than
yesterday.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.706
I still can't believe
we spent the night

20:08.708 --> 20:10.641
in a dark, dirty cave.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.544
Oh, it wasn't
that dark and dirty.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.583
( laughs ) Okay.
Yes, it was.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.551
But you know what.
It was still fun,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.620
because we were together.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.761
¶ Our trip got off
to a rocky start ¶

20:30.763 --> 20:32.830
¶ When we arrived
at the lodge ¶

20:32.832 --> 20:35.333
¶ That looked like
it would fall apart ¶

20:35.335 --> 20:39.370
¶ Then all our bags
wound up getting lost ¶

20:39.372 --> 20:41.372
¶ And we survived
the monkey tribe ¶

20:41.374 --> 20:44.242
¶ And their awful
berry toss ¶

20:44.244 --> 20:47.912
¶ But oh, what a vacation ¶

20:47.914 --> 20:51.949
¶ At times,
we wanted to give in ¶

20:51.951 --> 20:54.585
¶ But we braved
the rough weather ¶

20:54.587 --> 20:56.287
¶ And got through it
together ¶

20:56.289 --> 21:00.691
¶ Yes, we still
made it through ¶

21:00.693 --> 21:06.731
¶ And had more fun
than we ever knew ¶

21:06.733 --> 21:08.799
Look. The lodge.

21:08.801 --> 21:12.303
I suppose I should be happy
to be going home,

21:12.305 --> 21:14.205
but I don't know.

21:14.207 --> 21:16.607
Yeah, we never did see
those hot springs.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.744
And there's probably
a lot more exotic animals
to see.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.746
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

21:21.748 --> 21:23.547
We'd like to stay.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.615
- Can we?
- Yes, can we?

21:24.617 --> 21:27.151
Well, that's okay by me.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.053
I mean, that's fantastic
by me.

21:29.055 --> 21:32.657
Take us to
the hot springs, please.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.993
¶ At first, I thought
that this would be a bore ¶

21:35.995 --> 21:37.928
¶ But the adventure
we found ¶

21:37.930 --> 21:40.798
¶ Has made us want to
stay for more ¶

21:40.800 --> 21:44.335
¶ Some bumps,
a smidge of catastrophe ¶

21:44.337 --> 21:46.170
¶ Helped to remind us all ¶

21:46.172 --> 21:48.806
¶ That we love being
a family ¶

21:48.808 --> 21:53.511
¶ And oh,
what a vacation ¶

21:53.513 --> 21:57.248
¶ At times,
we wanted to give in ¶

21:57.250 --> 21:59.650
¶ But we braved
the rough weather ¶

21:59.652 --> 22:01.686
¶ And got through it
together ¶

22:01.688 --> 22:06.123
¶ After all that
we've been through ¶

22:06.125 --> 22:10.628
¶ We're having more fun
than we ever knew ¶

22:10.630 --> 22:14.365
¶ After all that
we've been through ¶

22:14.367 --> 22:15.866
¶ We're having more fun ¶

22:15.868 --> 22:18.302
¶ Having more,
having more fun ¶

22:18.304 --> 22:22.606
¶ Than we ever knew ¶

22:22.608 --> 22:28.713
¶ Than we ever knew ¶

22:28.715 --> 22:32.950
SOFIA: I can't wait for
our next family vacation, Mom.
