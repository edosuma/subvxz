WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:03.560
- Lou!
- All right,I'm coming!

00:03.860 --> 00:04.540
You all right?

00:04.610 --> 00:05.689
Yeah!

00:06.730 --> 00:07.640
Jesus!

00:07.670 --> 00:09.360
Hold on.

00:11.110 --> 00:12.220
Hey,what's going on?

00:12.290 --> 00:13.410
Hey,sorry it took so long.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.320
I was cleaning up the bedroom.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.050
It's a little messy.

00:15.090 --> 00:16.190
Where's the dog?

00:17.010 --> 00:20.060
Uh,well I put him in a
kennel,'cause I thought,

00:20.070 --> 00:25.000
you know,I didn't want to give him--have him
getting dog hair all over,uh,your,uh,place.

00:25.030 --> 00:26.220
What happened?

00:26.260 --> 00:27.210
What are you talking about?

00:27.280 --> 00:28.430
What's going on here?

00:28.510 --> 00:31.210
That's dirty laundry.

00:31.780 --> 00:32.780
That--what's
that?

00:32.850 --> 00:34.180
Clean laundry.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.950
Here,let me have that.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.960
There you go.Well,thanks,pal.
This is pretty much all I need.

00:38.000 --> 00:38.830
What are you doing?!

00:38.900 --> 00:39.920
What? It wasn't garbage?

00:39.990 --> 00:40.900
That's--that's
my coffee!

00:40.970 --> 00:43.020
Ah,well,it's garbage now.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.020
I don't know about this,lou.

00:45.090 --> 00:45.510
What are you talking about?

00:45.540 --> 00:47.210
It just seems a little cramped.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.060
It's perfect!

00:48.140 --> 00:48.770
Really?

00:48.800 --> 00:49.310
Yeah,look.

00:49.350 --> 00:53.970
We're only gonna be here together long
enough to eat pizza,watch porn,and sleep.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.870
What? You don't want to sleep?

00:54.940 --> 00:58.830
I just think when it comes to
roommates,you can't have 2 oscar madisons.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.590
You know what I mean?
Somebody's gotta be felix unger.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.260
Who says we need a felix unger?!

01:02.290 --> 01:03.430
It's the laws of nature.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.940
You can't have 2 walter
matthaus and no jack lemmon. Ok?

01:05.970 --> 01:09.020
Otherwise this place is gonna be overrun
by rodents and cockroaches within a month.

01:09.090 --> 01:09.680
And then what?

01:09.750 --> 01:10.540
We move.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.580
That's the beauty of renting.

01:13.920 --> 01:14.850
What's that?

01:14.920 --> 01:15.980
Oh,that's a present from frenchy.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.330
9/11 footage? What is it?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.320
She wanted me to look at,you
know,knowing I'm a writer.

01:19.390 --> 01:22.180
She wanted me to jot down my
thoughts and feelings for the book.

01:22.210 --> 01:23.690
Right. Did you watch it?

01:23.720 --> 01:24.450
I tried.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.700
I got about 3 seconds in.

01:25.770 --> 01:26.970
I started to unravel.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.450
Believe me,not something you
really want to be looking at.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.580
Especially by yourself.

01:30.650 --> 01:31.540
No,no.

01:31.580 --> 01:32.720
So you didn't get anything written,huh?

01:32.750 --> 01:34.500
Actually I'm on page 36.

01:35.450 --> 01:36.560
Really?

01:37.620 --> 01:41.260
You got 36 pages of writing
out of 3 seconds of footage?

01:41.290 --> 01:44.530
Come on,tom,this may be my
one and only chance ever to get

01:44.600 --> 01:47.920
a--published,b--laid by
a beautiful french woman.

01:47.950 --> 01:48.920
Enough with the finger.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.210
Ok.

01:50.350 --> 01:51.450
Let me get this straight.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.220
So you're taking the biggest tragedy in the
history of the city--perhaps the country--and

01:54.250 --> 01:56.690
you're taking your feelings
about it--which I know are real

01:56.720 --> 01:58.550
and genuine because you were
there and you lived through it,

01:58.590 --> 02:03.200
but you are now reconstituting them so
that you can get laid by a french broad.

02:03.270 --> 02:04.360
Is that right?

02:04.390 --> 02:05.100
Yeah,pretty much.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.280
Yeah. That's what I thought.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.350
Yeah,I really like this one,

02:07.380 --> 02:09.289
tom. Genevieve and I--
we've really connected.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.330
Oh,really? You've connected?

02:12.550 --> 02:13.820
Can I remind you of a couple of facts?

02:13.920 --> 02:15.320
Ok,number 1,you're not a writer.

02:15.350 --> 02:16.060
You're a fireman.

02:16.130 --> 02:18.220
I think we established
that a long time ago,ok?

02:18.260 --> 02:20.910
Number 2,where do I sleep?

02:20.940 --> 02:22.300
Uh,take the couch.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.100
Which would be...

02:24.170 --> 02:25.770
where?

02:28.370 --> 02:31.210
All right,maybe I should
clean up a little bit.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.670
Everybody back! Move it!

03:52.770 --> 03:53.720
Come on,folks move it!

03:53.760 --> 03:54.350
Get back!

03:54.390 --> 03:55.580
What do we got?

03:55.720 --> 03:56.950
It was a giant goddamn explosion.

03:56.990 --> 03:59.470
Shit's been popping off in the
surrounding buildings the last few minutes.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.160
That's all we know.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.920
Last explosion sent most people running.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.280
Might be a few stragglers.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.380
It's hard to see with all the smoke.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.100
This ain't smoke.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.410
Let's go guys.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.730
Hey,lou,what if there's another bomb?

04:08.800 --> 04:09.250
It wasn't a bomb.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.800
It's a busted steam pipe.

04:10.830 --> 04:14.070
This city's infrastructure goes
back to the goddamn stone age.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.070
Everybody all right?

04:25.100 --> 04:27.300
Lou,look!

04:31.230 --> 04:32.730
Look at this guy.

04:32.910 --> 04:34.140
Yeah,he's out.

04:35.770 --> 04:38.050
You want me to hit it
with the hallie,tom?

04:38.080 --> 04:39.050
No. Lou!

04:39.590 --> 04:40.480
Watch the weight.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.360
Now's not a time for fat jokes,tom.

04:46.110 --> 04:46.670
All set?

04:46.740 --> 04:49.140
I'm gonna get you out
of here. All right.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.920
Lou,stick him out!

04:50.950 --> 04:52.230
You got him?!

04:52.300 --> 04:53.370
Stay with me,pal.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.520
Hurry up.

04:54.630 --> 04:56.030
Ok,get him up.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.360
You got him?

05:01.010 --> 05:03.410
I got him! I got him!
Go get lou. Go get lou.

05:03.480 --> 05:03.710
Go get him!

05:03.780 --> 05:04.930
Give me your hand,lou!

05:10.200 --> 05:10.820
You all right?

05:10.930 --> 05:12.020
Yeah.

05:13.270 --> 05:14.040
Jesus!

05:16.900 --> 05:20.020
Yeah,well,I guess I could probably
stand to lose a few pounds.

05:20.090 --> 05:22.360
Yeah. 3,4 tops.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.080
Give me a hand with this guy.

05:24.200 --> 05:24.940
Come on.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.810
You look like you've
had some excitement.

05:37.850 --> 05:43.440
Yeah,well,actually just your run-of-the-mill
pickup truck falling into a pit of boiling water.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.750
No biggie.

05:45.290 --> 05:48.580
I might have something to show
you by,like,tomorrow,i think.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.170
I'll look forward to it,lou.

05:50.210 --> 05:50.860
Call me ken.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.140
It's my name,ken.

05:52.210 --> 05:54.030
Ken as in ken doll.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.550
That's exactly right. Yeah,ken doll.

05:55.590 --> 05:56.570
A little more rugged.

05:56.610 --> 05:58.230
Well,that's me,mr. Rugged.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.450
Mr. Rugged ken doll.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.910
Listen,I'm gonna go take
a shower,ok,'cause I stink.

06:01.980 --> 06:02.910
See ya.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.190
Tommy!

06:07.250 --> 06:10.300
Could I interest you
in a little homework?

06:10.330 --> 06:11.080
Let me guess.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.800
You want me to watch the
footage that you gave to lou.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.610
Yeah,and get your opinion.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.580
Ok. Um...no.

06:21.440 --> 06:27.080
I know you're mad because your
girlfriend threw you out the other night.

06:28.980 --> 06:31.130
Ok. My girlfriend didn't kick me out.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.690
It was a mutual decision.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.940
As a matter of fact,I think i mentioned
this to you when we were at your place

06:37.010 --> 06:38.230
that it wasn't going well.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.080
And I said to her,like,3 weeks
ago,like,"you know this is not going well.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.120
And this is basically--I'm gonna
give you,like,another chance here."

06:44.190 --> 06:45.260
Gave her one more chance.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.590
And,you know,basically

06:48.270 --> 06:49.560
she...

06:50.100 --> 06:51.280
she kicked me out.

06:51.430 --> 06:57.120
She smelled the wine when I came back from
that evening that we spent together,so...

06:57.150 --> 06:58.740
But,you know,like they say,

06:58.770 --> 07:02.800
when one door closes,another one opens.

07:25.170 --> 07:25.980
Sheila?

07:26.010 --> 07:27.300
Yes.

07:28.530 --> 07:31.140
I think you need to face a few facts.

07:31.220 --> 07:34.830
Like the fact that
tommy's a complete asshole,

07:34.870 --> 07:38.960
a selfish prick who can't see
that something meaningful and

07:39.030 --> 07:41.780
worthwhile is staring
him right in the face.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.680
And all he's done and keeps on
doing is pissing all over it.

07:44.710 --> 07:47.760
See,that's the major thing
I think you need to focus on.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.900
The pissing.

07:48.970 --> 07:50.420
The anger.

07:50.650 --> 07:52.250
Well,I know.

07:53.590 --> 07:55.390
Tommy is incredibly angry.

07:55.460 --> 07:57.260
Anger is like his oxygen.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.890
No,no,your anger.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.220
Oh,I'm not angry.

08:01.260 --> 08:02.070
Yes,you are.

08:02.110 --> 08:02.630
No,I'm not.

08:02.660 --> 08:03.390
Yes,you are.

08:03.420 --> 08:05.040
No.
I--mmm.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.560
I'm not angry.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.930
I can get angry.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Like if you keep talking about
how angry I am,you can get that

08:14.030 --> 08:17.440
angry mop and bucket because that
shit's going to be all over the place.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.300
Do you hear yourself?

08:18.330 --> 08:19.540
Do you?!

08:21.830 --> 08:26.140
Your anger is based on the
fact that your husband is gone

08:26.170 --> 08:32.070
and you have transferred all of your feelings
onto tommy gavin--your need,your love,

08:32.110 --> 08:33.919
your rage.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.070
You think you want tommy,

08:35.100 --> 08:39.100
but what you really want is to vent
all your frustration toward jimmy,

08:39.140 --> 08:43.070
why he took a job that
you knew was so dangerous,

08:43.100 --> 08:47.250
why he never came home,but tommy did,

08:47.290 --> 08:57.210
why you got left with a son to raise all by yourself,a son who now
tells you he wants to do exactly what his father did for  a living.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.410
You're keeping tommy around for
one reason and one reason only,

09:01.450 --> 09:05.660
and that is so you that
can blame it all on him.

09:05.690 --> 09:09.920
I want you to go home and purge
yourself of tommy,everything--

09:09.960 --> 09:14.030
the dreams,the plans,the
wishes,the hopes.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.780
Stop thinking about him.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.980
Stop dwelling on him.

09:18.010 --> 09:21.280
Stop blaming him.

09:23.090 --> 09:26.800
Well,you know,I'm a little busy,because damian is
gonna be staying at home with me for a couple of days--

09:26.840 --> 09:29.190
Perfect. Focus on damian.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.930
Yes,he wants to be a firefighter.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.120
Let him.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.680
He's gonna do it anyway.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.760
As a matter of fact,I think the
fact that you don't want him to

09:36.830 --> 09:39.260
do it makes it more attractive to him.

09:39.750 --> 09:40.500
Really?

09:40.570 --> 09:42.090
Sure. Think about it.

09:44.960 --> 09:44.960
His mother saying,no,no,no.

09:45.030 --> 09:48.850
Meanwhile the only father
figure he has in his life

09:48.890 --> 09:53.800
the handsome strapping hero--who
men admire and women fall all over,

09:53.840 --> 09:59.970
a seething urgent animal who slays
the dragon and sates his desires

10:00.010 --> 10:04.980
and gets to live outside the
standard rules of society.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.680
It's very inviting.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.130
What?

10:11.670 --> 10:12.810
I don't know.

10:12.870 --> 10:17.440
Sounds like I'm not the only
one who's gotta purge,you know.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.830
The command post was moved
when tower one went down!

11:41.860 --> 11:43.030
It's 5 blocks west!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.010
Shit!

11:47.230 --> 11:50.280
The command post was moved
when tower one went down!

11:50.350 --> 11:51.700
It's
5--

12:00.920 --> 12:01.690
Hey.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.200
Listen,I just saw him.

12:04.270 --> 12:04.930
Oh,yeah.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.070
Who was it this time?

12:06.110 --> 12:08.240
Jimmy keefe.
I just--

12:08.280 --> 12:12.520
I was watching news footage
from 9/11. And I saw him.

12:12.590 --> 12:14.400
We've all seen that
old news footage,tom.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.240
You and your crew heading
into the first tower.

12:16.310 --> 12:16.700
Ok.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.980
This is after the
first tower comes down.

12:20.050 --> 12:21.380
That's impossible.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.880
Jimmy died in the first tower.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.900
I know that.

12:23.970 --> 12:24.990
But I'm telling you,

12:25.070 --> 12:26.490
I'm almost certain it's him.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.020
The ghosts,jimmy,they only
come back when you're drinkin'.

12:29.090 --> 12:30.300
I'm sober as a judge.

12:30.340 --> 12:31.520
And I swear to god,mick,

12:31.690 --> 12:34.470
if it's not him it's a dead ringer.

12:34.510 --> 12:35.940
It's a goddamn identical twin.

12:35.980 --> 12:36.800
I'm telling ya.

12:36.830 --> 12:39.390
You think maybe you're
seeing what you want to see?

12:39.430 --> 12:43.400
Tom,turn off the television and
get yourself to a meeting right now.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.840
We all know where
this ends if you don'T.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.780
All right,maybe you're
right. Maybe you're right.

12:46.810 --> 12:47.690
I'm gonna turn it off.

12:47.730 --> 12:48.410
All right,good man.

12:48.450 --> 12:49.780
Listen. I'll talk to you later.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.090
All right.

12:56.290 --> 12:59.360
The command post was moved
when tower one went down!

13:11.020 --> 13:12.920
It's getting there,man.
It's coming along.

13:12.950 --> 13:15.360
Yeah,I think it'll be all gone
if we work for another day.

13:15.390 --> 13:16.390
You know,the paint?

13:16.430 --> 13:18.740
Another day of breathing
these paint-remover fumes,

13:18.770 --> 13:20.820
i won't be able to tie my
goddamn shoelaces anymore.

13:20.850 --> 13:22.320
I kinda like the way
the place looks now.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.340
I think we should go back to tommy's idea
of calling it the bombed out shithole.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.340
Got a nice ring to it.

13:26.370 --> 13:30.610
Come on. Enough dicking around,you guys,I poured
every dime of my mom's inheritance into this place.

13:30.650 --> 13:34.990
You know,my mom says if we
fail,I'll be dishonoring her memory.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.000
Wait,I didn't know you could
communicate with the dead,mikey.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.880
Well,I can't,but my psychic can.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.060
Your psychic can?

13:44.090 --> 13:47.630
Yeah. You know,I really
missed speaking with my mom,

13:47.890 --> 13:51.270
so I'm seeing this psychic doctor,and
she puts me in contact with her.

13:51.310 --> 13:52.370
Ain't that about a bitch?

13:52.410 --> 13:54.770
I can't get a cell signal
outside the burrough in manhattan.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.210
And dipshit here's got a
direct line to his dead mother.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.010
She must have verizon.

13:59.080 --> 14:04.220
Anyway,guys,she says if,you know,we keep our eye on
the ball,we can be successful here,so let's do it.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.400
Well,next time you two chat,why don't you ask if she's got
any bright ideas about what we should do with this dump.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.050
Hold on,fellas.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.580
What lou said before is
not too far off the mark.

14:10.620 --> 14:11.830
Yeah,you see.

14:12.120 --> 14:12.640
Why's that?

14:12.710 --> 14:14.490
You don't do anything with this place.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.760
People don't give a shit how the place looks
as long as they think this is the place to be.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.380
What you need is the
right word of mouth.

14:19.410 --> 14:21.820
The hottest spots I've ever been
to,they don't have any names.

14:21.860 --> 14:22.990
They don't even have signs.

14:23.020 --> 14:25.020
Takes you half an hour
just to find a goddamn door.

14:25.050 --> 14:28.070
You know,once you get in,shit is hot.

14:28.100 --> 14:28.960
It's bananas!

14:28.990 --> 14:30.760
You're saying we should go underground.

14:30.790 --> 14:31.370
Underground.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.240
That's where it's at.

14:32.270 --> 14:34.300
Yeah,I don't know.
What do you think,mike?

14:34.340 --> 14:35.580
Sounds good to me.

14:35.610 --> 14:36.990
I'll have to check with my mom first.

14:37.020 --> 14:39.550
Oh,your mom will love
taking it underground,mikey.

14:39.590 --> 14:40.600
Hell,she's there already.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.330
Oh,hey,you know what?
Sorry,man,we're closed.

14:44.370 --> 14:45.750
I can see that.

14:45.820 --> 14:46.660
When's the grand opening?

14:46.700 --> 14:48.140
We can't tell you
that,really. It's top-secret.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.330
I've afraid I'm gonna have to insist.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.070
I'm mark chilton,new york
state liquor authority.

14:52.110 --> 14:52.890
Hey,look at that.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.690
Another authority on
liquor in new york state.

14:54.730 --> 14:55.240
Brother!

14:55.280 --> 14:56.630
I guess that means you got one of these.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.520
Badges.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.360
No.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.730
We don't got no stinkin' badges.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.690
You ain't got no stinkin'
liquor license either.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.270
No,I have one of those.  I
can show it to you if you want.

15:04.310 --> 15:05.590
Don't bother. It's no good.

15:05.620 --> 15:06.860
It was revoked 2 owners ago.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.260
No,no,no,no. Hold on,partner.
How about the previous owners?

15:09.300 --> 15:10.680
How could they run a
bar without a license.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.060
That's a good question. I'm glad
you're making this easy for me.

15:13.130 --> 15:15.090
Oh,boy. Here we go.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.560
The guys who sold you this
place and I had an understanding.

15:17.590 --> 15:21.680
They'd write out a check made to
cash and put it in an envelope for me.

15:21.710 --> 15:28.280
And I'd be so busy taking that check to the bank and
spending all the money,that I'd forget to report 'em.

15:28.310 --> 15:30.300
That's a sweet deal.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.140
Wait a second.

15:32.210 --> 15:34.450
Are you saying-- you're
looking for a bribe?

15:34.480 --> 15:35.530
Certainly not.

15:35.570 --> 15:41.260
I'm simply relating a story about my relationship with the
previous owners that I thought you might find interesting.

15:41.330 --> 15:43.720
Oh,good.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.310
Wait a second. You are
looking for a bribe.

15:47.350 --> 15:48.650
Yeah,this really sucks.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.310
I guess,I'll go get my checkbook.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.640
My mom's gonna be livid.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.340
Hey,kiddo.

15:59.450 --> 16:00.460
Hey.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.620
Why the long face?

16:01.700 --> 16:04.270
I had a little bit of
an issue this morning.

16:04.340 --> 16:05.070
Tell me about it.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.980
I don't know. It's kinda private.

16:07.010 --> 16:08.620
You got limp dick?

16:08.660 --> 16:09.570
No!

16:09.600 --> 16:11.430
Sean,come on,after all these years
of telling each other everything,

16:11.460 --> 16:13.420
now you gotta pull the private card?

16:13.450 --> 16:15.420
It's either your dick,or you're queer.

16:15.460 --> 16:16.350
It's my dick.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.260
What's wrong with your dick?

16:17.330 --> 16:18.400
Nothing,frank.

16:18.430 --> 16:19.730
Ah,you can't get hard,huh?

16:19.760 --> 16:20.590
That's rough.

16:20.660 --> 16:21.620
Whose dick can't get hard?

16:21.690 --> 16:23.270
- Sean'S.
- Oh,jesus christ!

16:23.310 --> 16:25.000
You have a little performance
anxiety last night,sean?

16:25.030 --> 16:26.550
No,I didn'T.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.490
I was--it was
this morning. Ok?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.080
Don't sweat it,bro.
Happens to every guy.

16:30.110 --> 16:32.890
Not me of course. But,you
know,other guys. You for instance.

16:32.930 --> 16:34.370
Maybe you just weren't
that into the girl.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.540
No. It's definitely not that.

16:35.610 --> 16:36.210
You never know.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.100
I do.

16:37.130 --> 16:43.310
'Cause see it was just me
and my computer,you know...

16:43.480 --> 16:45.990
and the girls from planet slut.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.110
Yeah,I was going at
it for,like,30 minutes.

16:48.140 --> 16:48.680
I got nothing.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.970
Finally I ran out of jergens.
I had to throw in the towel.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.480
I mean,literally,I threw in the towel.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.120
I had a towel with me
for cleanup purposes.

16:54.150 --> 16:55.050
I had to throw it in.

16:55.090 --> 16:57.150
Turned out to be completely unnecessary.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.820
You got the iron palm going.

16:58.860 --> 16:59.450
The what?

16:59.490 --> 17:01.940
Gripping it too hard. Maybe
you cut off the circulation.

17:01.970 --> 17:03.160
Excuse me,black shawn.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.480
I think I know how to
handle myself with care.

17:05.550 --> 17:07.420
Maybe you just don't find
yourself attractive anymore.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.349
When's the last time you bought
your hand some nice flowers?

17:09.390 --> 17:10.900
Ok. Enjoy.

17:10.930 --> 17:11.890
Afternoon,gentlemen.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.430
Yeah.

17:15.450 --> 17:17.430
Don't sweat it. It happens to every guy.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.810
It does,though,right?

17:18.849 --> 17:19.579
Sure.

17:19.619 --> 17:22.660
Not me of course,but,you,definitely.

17:22.730 --> 17:24.290
I need you two.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.810
If I were you,I'd go to the doctor
and get that checked out right away.

17:26.869 --> 17:27.810
I got an appointment in an hour.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.470
Good boy.

17:28.510 --> 17:29.190
Lou.

17:29.220 --> 17:30.910
It happens to you,too,though,right?

17:30.980 --> 17:32.200
That's private.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.430
Hey,what are
you-- you writing?

17:41.460 --> 17:42.970
Uh,nothing.

17:44.610 --> 17:45.470
Poetry?

17:47.120 --> 17:47.750
No.

17:49.970 --> 17:51.210
What is it,then?

17:51.390 --> 17:52.750
It's nothing.

17:53.820 --> 17:57.550
Not,um,that psychic,is it?

17:57.620 --> 17:59.330
Who told you?

17:59.360 --> 18:01.060
Who didn't?

18:06.040 --> 18:12.070
I was just making some notes on some things I
want to say to my mom the next time we speak.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.090
'Cause every time I
communicate with her,

18:14.120 --> 18:19.580
I get all emotional and forget about
all the important things to say,you know.

18:19.830 --> 18:25.960
Mikey,I think I-- I speak for
most of the other guys when I say¡ª

18:26.000 --> 18:31.010
and I want to say this as
nicely as possible--ahem¡ª

18:31.050 --> 18:35.350
this whole psychic thing
sounds pretty,uh,retarded.

18:36.090 --> 18:36.790
I know.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.320
But this is different,tommy.

18:38.350 --> 18:39.530
You know,it's not what you think.

18:39.570 --> 18:43.530
She's not like,you know,pulling
fake magic tricks and stuff.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.640
She doesn't have a crystal ball.

18:44.670 --> 18:48.010
And she doesn't use,like,tarot
cards or do a seance or anything.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.530
She's a real doctor.

18:49.570 --> 18:51.610
Doctor of what?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.950
Psychic stuff.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.350
No. She has,like,a real
office,like a real doctor's office.

18:57.420 --> 18:57.990
I'm sure she does.

18:58.020 --> 19:01.020
She probably charges you more for that.

19:01.420 --> 19:02.620
It's not about the money,tommy.

19:02.660 --> 19:05.730
You know,she's putting me in touch with
somebody who I love who's not with us anymore.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.020
You know,you can't put
a price tag on that.

19:08.090 --> 19:09.010
What does she tell you?

19:09.040 --> 19:13.460
Well,I mean,she tells me a lot of stuff.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.930
But she knew,like,about
green point lake.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.790
And she even knew the
color of the house.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.200
And she knew the number of the house.

19:21.230 --> 19:24.030
And she even knew the phone
number to the house,tommy.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.300
She knew the actual phone number?

19:25.340 --> 19:26.970
Yeah.

19:27.140 --> 19:28.420
Maybe I should talk to her.

19:29.530 --> 19:30.500
My mom?

19:31.210 --> 19:32.470
The doctor.

19:33.050 --> 19:33.890
The chick.

19:34.130 --> 19:34.880
Yeah.

19:34.950 --> 19:38.070
What do you want to
talk to her about,though?

19:38.170 --> 19:41.220
You know,there's,like,lot
of dead people in my life.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.250
My dad,you know.

19:44.960 --> 19:45.840
Whoever.

19:46.030 --> 19:48.450
Um,can you make an appointment for me?

19:48.700 --> 19:49.500
Yeah.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.820
Sure.

19:51.060 --> 19:51.920
Ok.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.190
Do me a favor.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.000
Just keep it between us,all right?

19:55.160 --> 19:56.210
Why?

19:56.310 --> 19:59.760
'Cause I don't want
to look like a retard.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.690
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.250
No problem,tommy.

20:08.060 --> 20:11.300
Did you tell our daughter to start
having sex with her boyfriend?

20:11.330 --> 20:11.950
Yes,I did.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.250
And let me explain.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.510
Thank you.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.140
It's genius.

20:16.800 --> 20:17.500
It is?

20:17.600 --> 20:20.410
Yes. I don't want her marrying
this kid any more than you do.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.110
Right.

20:21.150 --> 20:24.400
Yeah. So if they start having sex,things
are going to get messy and complicated,

20:24.440 --> 20:27.550
and they're gonna forget this whole
marriage thing,which is ridiculous.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.960
Yeah.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.960
You're busting my balls,right?

20:31.990 --> 20:34.590
No,no,no. I am completely onboard
with your secret evil plan.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.500
Ok. Honey,it actually
wasn't a secret evil plan.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.210
I was trying to do the
right thing by our daughter.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.190
I was.

20:39.230 --> 20:43.570
Ok. The guy may be great--
The kid is disciplined.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.540
He doesn't smoke. He doesn't drink.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.340
I have nothing bad to say about the kid.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.540
Except for... the other thing.

20:49.710 --> 20:50.700
What other thing?

20:51.170 --> 20:53.050
The other thing.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.790
Honey,let's not make this
into a black thing. Ok.?

20:56.820 --> 20:59.240
You know what I have always said.

20:59.270 --> 21:02.030
I don't care what color,whether the
person is black,whether they're brown,

21:02.070 --> 21:04.770
if it's a muslim,no--
their religion.

21:04.810 --> 21:08.470
As long as they can
do the job,I--what?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.220
Were we ever married?

21:10.260 --> 21:12.490
It is not a black thing.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.580
Well,it's not a religious thing,'cause
I'm not even sure he's a muslim.

21:15.610 --> 21:20.130
- Is it a muslim thing?
- No! He's a firefighter.

21:20.530 --> 21:24.210
Which means that colleen's gonna go to bed every
night wondering whether she's going to to be a widow

21:24.240 --> 21:28.970
and wondering if she's going to have to tell
her kids that their daddy won't be coming home.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.190
You know,and this guy may not drink or
smoke,and he may not carry on like you did,

21:33.260 --> 21:36.220
but he still rushes into
burning buildings for a living.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.030
So no matter what color he
is or who he bows down before,

21:39.100 --> 21:41.590
we both know what he worships most.

21:42.110 --> 21:43.480
It's the job.

21:44.230 --> 21:49.480
I don't care who colleen marries,so
long as it's not a fireman,

21:49.780 --> 21:54.660
but if you really love your daughter,then you'll
make sure that she has sex with her boyfriend.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.190
And I mean right now,goddamn it.

21:56.220 --> 21:57.580
Ok.

21:57.610 --> 21:58.520
All right.

21:58.590 --> 22:00.390
I think that's it. Ok.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.420
How's katy?

22:04.490 --> 22:05.990
Still single.

22:12.630 --> 22:17.180
What you've expressed in these
pages,I'm at a loss for words.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.490
You liked them?

22:18.520 --> 22:23.380
- The raw emotion,the honesty,it's more than I could have hoped for.
- Really?

22:23.420 --> 22:30.440
For the first time,since i started writing
the story,actually perhaps for the first time

22:30.510 --> 22:37.150
since I was a student,it
brought tears to my eyes.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.150
Thank you.

22:41.070 --> 22:47.990
It's--it's the first time a woman's
ever thanked me for making her cry.

22:50.790 --> 22:53.130
I,uh--I
got an "a".

22:53.270 --> 22:54.590
Really?

22:55.030 --> 22:58.190
Let me guess what the "a" stands for.

22:58.260 --> 22:59.230
Awesome,right?

22:59.260 --> 23:00.700
Absolument.

23:00.730 --> 23:02.080
Awesome.

23:02.110 --> 23:03.650
That's 2 "a's".

23:03.780 --> 23:06.270
So I guess you finally
watched that footage,huh?

23:06.350 --> 23:07.700
Yeah.

23:07.990 --> 23:10.590
How much of the footage
did you end up watching?

23:10.660 --> 23:12.070
All of it.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.750
Anything in particular from the
footage that kind of jumped out at you?

23:15.790 --> 23:16.720
All of it.

23:17.330 --> 23:23.230
I would imagine so since you got
36 pages out of-- 46,actually.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.830
Yeah. Once I started,it
just kind of flowed.

23:26.860 --> 23:28.000
It must have been cathartic.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.320
It was. It was very cathartic.

23:30.350 --> 23:36.540
I can imagine,'cause I'm gonna have a
little catharsis of my own in the sink.

23:40.290 --> 23:42.120
Perhaps I should buy you a drink.

23:42.190 --> 23:43.720
You know,we're opening our bar tonight.

23:43.750 --> 23:47.330
You should-- you
should come on down.

23:47.710 --> 23:50.430
This is the address. Just show up here.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.480
Don't tell anybody. No one's
supposed to know where it is.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.540
Don't you want people to come?

23:53.580 --> 23:54.950
I don't know. It'S...

23:54.980 --> 23:56.480
Ok. Well,I'll see you later.

23:56.550 --> 23:57.540
Ok.

23:57.960 --> 23:58.610
Bye.

23:58.650 --> 23:59.480
Bye-bye.

23:59.510 --> 24:00.100
Bye.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.000
So what's up with the cock block,tom?

24:09.030 --> 24:10.000
The cock block?

24:11.820 --> 24:16.580
You know,if I wanted to cock-block you,which
I could do with one ball tied behind my sac,

24:16.610 --> 24:19.230
you wouldn't have even
gotten that drink invite. Ok?

24:19.260 --> 24:25.180
You're telling me that finally somehow you
sat down and decided to watch the footage.

24:25.220 --> 24:27.950
I watched 3 1/2 seconds. There's no
reason for her to know that,asshole.

24:27.980 --> 24:30.870
Boy,3 seconds,and you got 46 pages.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.600
That was some goddamn writing.

24:32.640 --> 24:39.710
Do you think that I need to watch any
goddamn footage to remind me of that day,tom?!

24:39.780 --> 24:43.890
To remind me of what
I saw and what I felt?

24:43.930 --> 24:46.130
To remind me of what my
nightmares are still like,tom?

24:46.170 --> 24:47.780
Do you think I need that?

24:48.320 --> 24:52.890
What I write down in these pages
is a little bit,a tiny,little chunk,

24:52.920 --> 24:56.150
a healthy little chunk of some of the
shit that I'm feeling inside of me.

24:56.190 --> 25:00.510
And maybe by doing
it,tom,maybe,just maybe,

25:01.040 --> 25:07.070
I can chip away at it and I can
lighten my load just a little bit.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.840
3 1/2 goddamn seconds of footage.

25:10.900 --> 25:14.280
You know,tom,you weren't the
only one down there that day.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.890
And sometimes you forget that.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.660
And sometimes I have to remind you.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.250
I just did.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.560
Do I just start talking?

25:31.630 --> 25:33.100
If you like.

25:35.630 --> 25:36.730
Are you tape-recording this?

25:36.770 --> 25:39.470
No. No. This is private.

25:42.970 --> 25:51.450
Well,I guess I should say that I don't
really,uh,believe in any of this kind of stuff.

25:51.490 --> 25:54.130
You know,I think it's kind of a con.

25:54.170 --> 25:57.410
I just wanted to get
that out of the way.

25:57.450 --> 25:59.410
I'm already aware of that.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.240
Right,'cause you're psychic.

26:08.790 --> 26:14.670
So,what's this little staring
contest going to cost me?

26:14.730 --> 26:17.920
100--100 bucks
a session? 150?

26:17.990 --> 26:21.000
I'll do it for free if it
would make you more comfortable.

26:21.040 --> 26:25.950
That's all right.
I'll pay for your time.

26:26.020 --> 26:28.920
Mr. Gavin,what I do here is real.

26:28.950 --> 26:30.630
There is no hypnosis.

26:30.670 --> 26:32.020
There's no crystal ball.

26:32.050 --> 26:33.630
There's no incense.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.720
There are no tarot cards.

26:35.750 --> 26:40.280
The fact that the dead choose to
communicate through me is not my own choice.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.350
You're just lucky.

26:43.420 --> 26:47.300
I didn't expect so much skepticism
from someone who has the gift.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.350
The gift?

26:49.570 --> 26:52.310
It can be a burden,can't it?

26:52.380 --> 26:54.720
Especially when you can't control it...

26:55.540 --> 27:00.540
to carry those spirits with you for so long,only
to have them abandon you in your hour of need.

27:02.070 --> 27:04.430
When was your last visitation?

27:05.640 --> 27:09.100
Obviously it's been some time.

27:12.920 --> 27:18.540
Your cousin jimmy,you feel that
since you've stopped drinking,

27:18.570 --> 27:21.280
it might be harder for him to reach you.

27:21.310 --> 27:22.740
That's not it.

27:22.810 --> 27:27.500
He's upset about damian.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.480
You know what?

27:33.520 --> 27:37.690
You have my name. Obviously
you know where I work.

27:39.380 --> 27:40.290
I work for the city.

27:40.320 --> 27:44.160
So the internet,all
this stuff's available.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.290
So I'm not buying it.

27:49.670 --> 27:52.850
You know,I don't know how much money
you're making off of this particular setup,

27:52.880 --> 27:54.500
but maybe you should go
back to the original one,

27:54.530 --> 27:58.030
you know with the storefront and
the neon sign that flashes "psychic,"

27:58.060 --> 28:02.790
because I think you'd pull in a lot
more chumps right off the street.

28:03.470 --> 28:05.290
Nice talking to ya.

28:11.130 --> 28:12.340
Hey,houston and varick,all right.

28:12.360 --> 28:15.960
On monday and not seen
there for--for very long.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.740
Roger,you been
up to 2 things--

28:17.760 --> 28:19.480
one,keeping an eye on
the office for activity,

28:19.500 --> 28:21.100
and 2,talking
to new yorkers--

28:21.120 --> 28:23.980
Hey,how do you turn this thing down?

28:26.460 --> 28:28.080
This,it did not work for me.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.250
I've
got to--

28:30.700 --> 28:31.490
Yeah.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.550
Where you been,pally?

28:32.570 --> 28:34.440
I keep getting your
voice mail. I was worried.

28:34.460 --> 28:35.090
What's up?

28:35.110 --> 28:37.050
I don't think me working
here is such a good idea.

28:37.070 --> 28:38.850
You wanted a job. I got
you a job. All right.

28:38.870 --> 28:40.240
Just treat it like it's a test.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.390
I'm not ready for it.

28:41.410 --> 28:43.260
I'm surrounded by temptation.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.610
All right,I'll be down. All right.

28:45.630 --> 28:46.690
Thanks,pally.

28:46.710 --> 28:48.240
Stop--

28:50.860 --> 28:56.100
Change of plans. We're gonna
go to 2nd between c and D.

28:56.950 --> 29:03.010
Research-- Pharmaceuticals in the
water of 24 other metropolitan areas.

29:03.030 --> 29:08.260
Federal state surveys of new york's
water supply found rust in the¡ª

29:08.280 --> 29:11.880
The command post was moved
when tower one went down!

29:11.900 --> 29:13.930
The amounts are well below
the levels of letting them go,

29:13.970 --> 29:17.330
but ace journalist
who worked--

29:24.220 --> 29:24.740
What's up?

29:24.760 --> 29:25.860
What's going on?

29:25.880 --> 29:26.600
Nothing.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.650
What are you guys doing?

29:27.670 --> 29:28.470
They're bait.

29:28.490 --> 29:31.710
Bait for what? What are you trying to
attract,grizzly bears? No offense,guys.

29:31.730 --> 29:33.710
Yeah,none taken,dickface.

29:35.860 --> 29:36.920
It was needles' idea.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.590
You know,he said people
would be walking by.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.220
They'd see the velvet rope,see
we're not letting these guys in.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.340
They get curious.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.920
- It's that simple. It worked.
- Really?

29:43.940 --> 29:46.760
Yeah,black shawn was
right. Word got around.

29:46.780 --> 29:47.950
Hello,ladies.

29:47.970 --> 29:48.820
What's going on?

29:48.840 --> 29:49.700
Nothing.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.270
Come on. Let us in. We want to party.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.870
Sorry,ladies. House is full.

29:53.890 --> 29:55.890
Please.

29:55.910 --> 29:58.590
As you can see,there's nothing I can do.

30:05.190 --> 30:06.300
You're good.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.960
Come on,man.

30:10.650 --> 30:12.430
Have a good night.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.290
Shit.

30:15.450 --> 30:16.610
You guys are ok with this?

30:16.630 --> 30:19.060
200 bucks each to stand
here and get flashed?

30:19.080 --> 30:20.990
We'd do it for free.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.760
That's good to know,guys.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.290
Keep that in mind.

30:25.310 --> 30:27.490
Nice going,asshole.

30:36.070 --> 30:38.180
Ahh,shit!

30:38.540 --> 30:39.770
I thought you had that checked out.

30:39.790 --> 30:42.670
I did. The doctor said it might
be a slipped disk or something.

30:42.690 --> 30:46.950
He didn't want to put me on any medication
though until I get my results back from the R.E.M.

30:46.970 --> 30:51.190
You know,unless the band has branched
out,I think you're talking about an M.R.I.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.210
Yes. That's what he said.

30:54.230 --> 30:56.230
But I wish I could take
something,'cause it's killing me.

30:56.250 --> 30:58.750
You're in a goddamn bar. You're
surrounded by pain killers.

30:58.770 --> 31:01.380
Actually,alcohol makes the pain worse.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.480
It's not a cure for anything.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.860
You know,that's not true.

31:08.880 --> 31:15.860
After 3 tumblers of this stuff,I go from thinking I'm
looking like a middle-aged fireman to george goddamn clooney.

31:17.350 --> 31:18.880
Ok. Like 5 tumblers.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.030
Yeah.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.080
You all right. Did you drink?

31:26.100 --> 31:28.990
- No. I think I just had a moment. That's all.
- All right.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.810
- It'll pass.
- Ok.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.230
What's he doing here?

31:33.520 --> 31:35.340
- I called him.
- You called him?

31:35.770 --> 31:38.140
I couldn't get a hold of
you,pally. I was desperate.

31:38.150 --> 31:40.230
- You all right?
- Yeah. It passed.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.130
Yeah.

31:41.790 --> 31:44.260
You,outside now.

31:45.730 --> 31:47.220
Thanks.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.150
What?

31:54.790 --> 31:56.190
You're shitting me,right?

31:56.210 --> 31:58.710
He needed a job. I got
him a job. Trying to do--

31:58.750 --> 32:00.410
As a bar back?

32:00.430 --> 32:02.850
You're not really gonna lecture me
about how to be a sponsor,are you?

32:02.870 --> 32:06.880
Because the last time I looked,you had me in a bar
with a goddamn glass of whiskey under my nose. Ok.

32:06.900 --> 32:11.240
All right. But at least I don't have him in a
bar with a whole bar of whiskey under his nose.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.270
Where is your head at?

32:13.930 --> 32:15.750
Christ. Hang on a sec.

32:15.830 --> 32:17.010
Guess who?

32:17.030 --> 32:18.890
- Yeah.
- Hey,pally,you didn't leave yet,did you?

32:18.930 --> 32:20.500
No. No. No. I'm right outside.

32:20.510 --> 32:24.730
Good. I'm on the way to the stockroom,and
this pudgy chick gave me the eyeball.

32:24.750 --> 32:25.950
Now she wants to buy me a drink.

32:25.970 --> 32:28.690
- She's a pudgy chick?
- Yeah.

32:29.560 --> 32:33.860
But she's got huge tits. Ok. I'm
gonna solve your problem. You're fired.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.660
Happy?

32:34.680 --> 32:36.630
You know,decision making has
never been your strong suit,

32:36.650 --> 32:39.080
but this is even going too far for you.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.180
Tell me you're not drinking.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.180
I'm not drinking.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.190
Because ever since you told me
you started seeing jimmy again...

32:44.210 --> 32:47.390
All right,listen,you know what?
That's--I'm seeing somebody about that.

32:47.410 --> 32:50.020
- A shrink?
- No.

32:50.040 --> 32:53.140
Tom,I'm in shock. I mean,I never
thought you'd go in for therapy,but--

32:53.150 --> 32:55.940
Listen. It's not
therapy. It's not therapy.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.890
But she comes highly
recommended. She's a psychic.

32:59.910 --> 33:02.510
Ok. I know.

33:02.530 --> 33:03.070
I'm gonna fall down.

33:03.090 --> 33:05.070
No,listen. She's
telling me stuff--

33:05.090 --> 33:07.050
- Tom,these people are full of shit.
- She's telling me stuff.

33:07.070 --> 33:09.900
They're worse than the con artists at the
catholic church. What are you talking about?

33:09.920 --> 33:12.280
I'm just telling ya it's
kinda working for me,ok?

33:12.330 --> 33:15.470
It's smoke and mirrors.
They're snakes,those people.

33:15.490 --> 33:17.150
Ok. It's not like what
you think it is,number 1.

33:17.170 --> 33:19.760
And number 2,what do you want me
to do,tell her she's crazy? Ok.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.860
Because she sees dead
people--she talks to dead people.

33:21.880 --> 33:22.990
I've been doing that for 8 years.

33:23.010 --> 33:25.590
No. Good then. So,you both
got something in common.

33:25.610 --> 33:27.330
You're both delusional.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.610
You know,this--this is
really helping me out. Ok.

33:30.630 --> 33:32.680
This is great. Great.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.040
You know what?

33:35.060 --> 33:37.210
Let's just--let's get
in the cab right now.

33:37.230 --> 33:41.600
- We'll go to a meeting. We'll nip this thing in the bud.
- Everything's a meeting. A meeting solves everything.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.290
- You go back in there,you're making a choice to go back--  
- I'm working here!

33:44.310 --> 33:47.050
You're in a bar. You're seeing
jimmy. You're thinking about jimmy.

33:47.070 --> 33:48.860
Where do you think it's gonna go?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.220
Tom,it's in the past.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.860
Do me favor. Let's just
leave it in the past.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.490
You gotta make that decision to move on.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.570
What do you say?

34:03.090 --> 34:05.010
I'm going back inside.

34:19.699 --> 34:21.750
Hey,why'd you fire derek?

34:21.770 --> 34:23.210
What do you mean,he's getting
on everybody's nerves,right?

34:23.230 --> 34:25.440
I know. But he's a hard worker,tom.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.190
I can't win
with this--

34:27.210 --> 34:28.989
Hey,where you going?

34:29.010 --> 34:29.830
You just fired me!

34:29.850 --> 34:31.500
No. No. No. You're
rehired. Go back to work.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.550
And don't drink this time.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.600
Come on,hurry up.

34:33.620 --> 34:34.940
Oh,I get it,pally.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.739
It was another test.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.659
And you know what?
Just cut the pally shit.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.440
Sure thing,chief.

34:42.460 --> 34:44.540
This guy's such a ballbuster.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.670
Hey,how'd your meeting
go with my psychic doctor?

34:46.690 --> 34:47.760
She's pretty cool,huh?

34:47.780 --> 34:51.000
Well,I think she's more of a
psychic than she is a doctor,mike.

34:51.020 --> 34:52.800
It's not my thing,you know.

34:52.820 --> 34:56.600
Whatever. I mean,I just want to
say I'm really glad you went,though.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.810
Yeah. I don't think I'll
be going again,you know?

34:58.820 --> 35:02.230
I don't know. I think you should. I
mean,she was really eager to meet you,too.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.440
What do you mean?

35:03.460 --> 35:04.710
We talked.

35:04.730 --> 35:05.940
Yeah.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.380
Your name comes up. There's a
lot of luggage that goes along--

35:08.400 --> 35:10.230
- Baggage.
- What?

35:10.250 --> 35:13.320
Nothing. Did you talk to
her before i went to see her?

35:13.340 --> 35:14.310
Yeah,a little bit.

35:14.330 --> 35:15.120
About what?

35:15.140 --> 35:20.860
Um,just like your dad dying,you know.
And your alcoholic issues. And,uh--

35:20.880 --> 35:21.840
Yeah?

35:21.900 --> 35:25.510
How you like to use those
beauty creams on your face.

35:25.960 --> 35:29.030
That was--what's wrong with you
telling people about the beauty cream.

35:29.050 --> 35:30.530
I used that beauty cream,like,once.

35:30.550 --> 35:32.070
Once,tommy?

35:32.090 --> 35:35.040
You give me that little
tube. 3 times,maybe.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.330
Don't you tell people shit like that.

35:37.350 --> 35:38.300
What's wrong with you?!

35:38.320 --> 35:40.560
What else did you tell her?

35:40.580 --> 35:41.870
- Connor.
- Yeah.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.580
And your brother and jimmy.
And of course that whole--

35:44.600 --> 35:48.080
Wait,wait,wait,wait. You
talked to her about jimmy?

35:48.100 --> 35:51.520
Why don't you just give her my goddamn
social security number while you're at it?

35:51.570 --> 35:55.970
Um,'cause I don't know your
social security number,tom.

36:00.110 --> 36:01.510
What?

36:06.900 --> 36:08.580
What's wrong?

36:11.180 --> 36:13.220
- May I help you?
- Yeah. Yeah. I want to see the doc.

36:13.270 --> 36:15.880
- I'm sorry,sir. Sessions are by appointment only.
- Yeah. I'm making an appointment.

36:15.890 --> 36:18.320
- Hey,doc! Come on out!
- I'm afraid you'll have to wait for her.

36:18.340 --> 36:19.380
Yeah. Yeah. I'll wait for her right now.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.030
Sorry,sir.

36:20.050 --> 36:21.670
Is she even a doctor?

36:21.690 --> 36:24.540
- Mr. Gavin,I'm in a session.
- I just came down to congratulate you.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.130
I can't believe how
simple this bullshit is.

36:27.150 --> 36:28.590
Mike told me.You interviewed him.

36:28.610 --> 36:30.670
You asked him certain questions,right.
And you find out certain information.

36:30.690 --> 36:33.180
This is unacceptable. If
you would come back later--

36:33.200 --> 36:40.910
You make money off people who are suffering loss and grief
by finding out shit and throwing it back in their face.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.710
And I don't
know--what'd you lose?

36:42.730 --> 36:44.300
Mother,father,what?

36:44.320 --> 36:45.020
My dog.

36:45.040 --> 36:45.890
Her dog. Her goddamn dead dog.

36:45.910 --> 36:54.480
And you're making money off of her grief and
her loss and her love for her dead goddamn dog!

36:54.500 --> 36:56.480
You're a piece of shit. You know that>

36:56.540 --> 36:58.530
You know what you are? You're a carny.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.520
You're a carny with teeth and an office.

37:02.540 --> 37:04.270
Screw you!

37:04.290 --> 37:06.350
The footage doesn't lie.

37:08.380 --> 37:14.490
He wants you to know the truth about
what happened to him that day,how he died.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.550
Sorry about your dog.
