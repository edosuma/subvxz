00:08.039 --> 00:11.010
Ash: 30 years ago,
I found "The Book of the Dead."

00:11.160 --> 00:13.242
Now, because
I read from the book...

00:13.400 --> 00:15.402
Mesartra.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.925
Ash:
...evil has found me.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.327
Burn in hell!
(yells)

00:19.480 --> 00:20.891
( screams )

00:22.000 --> 00:23.240
She's here.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.050
Dad?
( Kelly gasps )

00:25.200 --> 00:27.567
- What did you see?
- My mother...

00:28.560 --> 00:29.971
but she died.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.121
( Screams )

00:31.280 --> 00:33.931
- Can't outrun evil, Ash.
- Watch me!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.126
( Screams )

00:36.280 --> 00:37.361
Pablo: Ash!

00:37.520 --> 00:39.682
Help me.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.763
(yells )

00:43.480 --> 00:45.130
♪ Come along if you care ♪

00:45.280 --> 00:46.964
( Cackles )

00:47.120 --> 00:50.203
♪ Come along
if you dare. ♪

00:56.440 --> 00:59.728
That, my friends,
is how we do it.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.122
Look, I have no idea where you
learned how to kill those things.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.965
- But if whatever I saw--
- I call them "Deadites."

01:07.120 --> 01:09.566
And I'd say it's a gift from God,
but that would be giving

01:09.720 --> 01:11.688
the man upstairs
a little too much credit.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.927
This is all me, baby.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.082
Very humble.
But listen,

01:15.240 --> 01:17.925
if whatever I saw
at my dad's house is a Deadite,

01:18.080 --> 01:19.411
then he's in a lot of danger.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.403
We are way past danger.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.125
That's why we have
to get that book translated

01:23.280 --> 01:26.204
and find the phrase that'll put the lid
back on all this bullshit.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.010
Okay, well,
what if we stop at Kelly's

01:28.160 --> 01:29.286
on the way to get
your book looked at?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.608
- It's a win-win.
- Sorry. No can do.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.444
Well, I can't just abandon him.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.649
Look, I get that you
want to save your dad,

01:36.800 --> 01:38.802
but I'm trying to save
all the dads everywhere

01:38.960 --> 01:40.291
and the mommies
and the babies.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.363
So, if you'll forgive me,
but I gotta duct-tape

01:42.520 --> 01:44.522
some big-ass bullet holes
before I roll.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.481
Wow.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.644
( Electricity buzzing )

01:57.200 --> 02:00.124
( humming )

02:22.560 --> 02:24.324
(wind whooshes )

02:26.720 --> 02:28.290
( buzzing )

02:44.720 --> 02:47.883
(growling )

02:55.040 --> 02:56.166
( 110g barks )

02:58.320 --> 03:00.527
Kelly!

03:00.680 --> 03:02.091
Wait, please!

03:02.280 --> 03:04.681
You can't go back there alone!

03:07.600 --> 03:08.931
Shit.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.770
Looks like your girlfriend
took your bike.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.201
I tried to get her to stop,
but she wouldn't listen to me.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.931
Yeah, I know it's not
a very PC thing to say these days,

03:16.080 --> 03:18.082
but, uh, chicks are like that.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.571
- Mm.
- It's just a fact.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.081
Well, I'm shoving off
to take care of the book.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.926
- Catch you on the flip-flop.
- Um, about the book...

03:26.920 --> 03:28.922
...she took it.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.445
- She took it?
- Uh, yeah.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.681
She grabbed it
on her way out.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.569
I guess she thinks
it's gonna help her with her mom.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.008
- Fuck me!
- I can take you to her dad's.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.049
All right, wipe your feet
and get in.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.401
Sweet.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.564
( Rock music
playing on radio )

03:54.960 --> 03:57.201
So you think Kelly's mom
could've turned into a Deadite?

03:57.360 --> 03:59.169
Moms don't just
come back to life.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.288
If Kelly's old lady's
walking around,

04:01.440 --> 04:03.442
I'm probably going
to have to cut her head off.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.523
Oh, man.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.961
I really don't want to have
to fight any more of those things.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.485
Well, for your first time,
you did great.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.045
Most folks just end up dead.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.807
Yeah, but I don't-- I don't wanna
end up dead like most folks.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.644
Hey, do you got
any fighting tips?

04:16.800 --> 04:20.805
Trust me, once you
get jacked in the face, it'll all click.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.325
I can't even
get my nut up to rumble

04:22.480 --> 04:24.130
unless I've had
a good shot to the chin.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.370
Man. You're like an expert.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.205
I mean, it looks like
you've taken a punch.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.771
I don't know about that.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.242
I think this mug
is basically mint condition.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.561
- ( Screams )
- Oh, my God!

04:37.720 --> 04:39.404
- ( Growls)
_ oh! Ty

04:39.560 --> 04:41.324
( music gets louder)

04:42.600 --> 04:43.647
Oh, my God, Mr. Roper!

04:43.840 --> 04:46.286
I've always hated you.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.361
( Honking )

05:11.560 --> 05:14.803
Pablo, do something!

05:17.720 --> 05:19.927
Hey, Mr. Roper...

05:20.080 --> 05:22.208
- ( hisses )
- Oh, shit.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.446
Oh, fuck!

05:24.600 --> 05:26.329
( Tires squealing )

05:26.480 --> 05:29.563
Look, Ash, I know you said that
when I get hit I'd know what to do!

05:29.760 --> 05:33.162
But I just got hit,
and I don't know what to do!

05:33.320 --> 05:35.209
( Screaming )

05:36.320 --> 05:39.210
- Ah!

06:02.920 --> 06:04.684
You sad, old failure.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.167
You'll never defeat evil.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.402
Yeah?
Thanks for the heads up.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.320

06:25.240 --> 06:27.971

- Is this what it's like to be you?
- Yep, pretty much.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.564
Never killed my boss before,
so that was new.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.804
That was the scariest thing
that's ever happened to me.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.128
I thought I was dead.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.089
But then it was so cool
when you said,

06:42.240 --> 06:43.969
"Thanks for the heads up."

06:44.120 --> 06:46.805
At first I was like,
did he mean it like that?

06:46.960 --> 06:49.611
And then I realized
it's the "jefe."

06:49.800 --> 06:51.529
Of course he did.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.007
This ain't my first rodeo, kid.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.528

( quiet chatter)

07:24.320 --> 07:26.926
Woman:
You the police?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.003
A lot of death
around here lately.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.766
Yeah, more than
we've ever had.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.729
Special Agent Fisher.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.609
Michigan State Police.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.684
It's very possible this is connected
to the killings from the other night.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.888
Do you know who--
who lived there?

07:41.040 --> 07:42.610
We don't know his name,

07:42.760 --> 07:45.445
but he was always a real asshole
to me and my wife

07:45.600 --> 07:48.729
and our kids and pretty much
everyone else around.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.283
Woman: You should
tell her about the girls.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.561
About the girls he brought...

07:54.720 --> 07:57.200
(whispering )

08:00.120 --> 08:03.329
Man: Sometimes he'd
bring whores back to his trailer.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.002
Did you hear what I said?

08:07.160 --> 08:08.525
Yeah, whores.
Got it.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.923
Last one he brought back,
some girl with a skanky wrist tattoo.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.367
I heard 'em chant
some weird voodoo stuff

08:14.520 --> 08:16.204
from inside that crappy trailer.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.001
Wait. You said "wrist tattoo"?

08:20.160 --> 08:24.290
I'm pretty sure that's not
the only place she had one.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.244
Thanks for your help.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.688
(wind howling )

08:57.520 --> 09:00.126
- Well, it's cozy.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.087
(windmill creaking )

09:10.240 --> 09:12.368
( creaking )

09:17.440 --> 09:19.442
Whoa, man.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.443
Something seems
very wrong here.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.443
It always does.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.331
Okay, here's the plan.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.450
We bust in there,
we fight through the carnage,

09:29.600 --> 09:31.602
- we bail with the book.
- Okay, yeah.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.445
Oh, God. What if Kelly's mom
gave Kelly the evil force

09:34.600 --> 09:36.011
and then you have
to cut off Kelly's head--

09:36.160 --> 09:37.889
Pablo, focus up.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.123
Just stay behind me,
let the boom stick do the talking.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.282
Things get hairy,
use your bottle.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.643
Um, I don't think
it's a very good weapon, jefe.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.882
You had to stab Roper,
like, 50 times.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.407
Hey, I was sharpening it for you.
Now, come on, you ready?

09:53.560 --> 09:54.561
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this!

09:54.720 --> 09:55.767
- I'm feeling strong.
- Yeah!

09:55.920 --> 09:57.331
- Isi Se puede!
- Isi Se puede!

09:59.200 --> 10:01.009
Where's my book?!

10:03.720 --> 10:05.484
Please-- please don't hurt us.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.483
Take anything,
but you will not touch my family.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.246
My God.
What are you guys doing here?

10:10.400 --> 10:13.244
Oh, shit. Hey. Hi, Kelly.
You're okay.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.050
Y-you know these men?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.690
- Well--
- Uh, yeah.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.564
Uh, we're-- we're friends
from work.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.886
Man, you have a nice house.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.883
Yeah, we were just passing through,

10:22.040 --> 10:23.929
thought we'd stop in and say hi.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.491
Hi.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.886
Why are you covered in blood?

10:27.040 --> 10:29.884
Um, we hit a deer
on the way up here.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.441
And when I tried to
pull it out of the grill of my car,

10:32.600 --> 10:34.602
the sucker
just exploded all over us...

10:34.760 --> 10:37.127
( laughing )
...so we had to cut it up

10:37.320 --> 10:39.641
with my chainsaw arm.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.963
I'm actually a hunter,
and I've never seen a deer explode.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.242
Well, maybe you're
not hunting the right deer.

10:45.400 --> 10:49.405
Okay, uh, could you
just excuse us for one second?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.686
( Whispering )
Jesus, you GUYS-

10:51.840 --> 10:53.444
Look, my mom's alive.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.127
She was living in a homeless shelter
in Ohio with amnesia,

10:57.280 --> 10:59.726
and then yesterday she finally
started to remember who she was.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.121
- That's great.
- Yeah, pretty convenient timing.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.044
Okay. Look, Ash,
I know we saw

11:04.200 --> 11:06.009
some crazy shit
in your trailer park,

11:06.160 --> 11:08.003
but this has nothing
to do with that.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.605
Does she look like
one of those things?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.171
No, but when it comes to evil,

11:11.320 --> 11:14.051
if something seems
too good to be true, it probably is.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.804
Now, about my book.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.564
Sweetie, is everything okay?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.087
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Um, sorry.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.648
Um, Mom, Dad,
this is my friend, Pablo.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.167
He got me the job
at Value Stop.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.926
-( Buzzing )
- And, uh, this is Ash,

11:29.120 --> 11:31.202
a person I never thought
would be in my home.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.283
Hi. You used to be dead, right?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.330
- Ash!
- Honey, it's okay.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.324
L-I don't blame you
for telling people I was dead.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.482
I might as well have been dead.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.041
The only thing
I can remember

11:44.200 --> 11:47.602
is driving to the store
in a terrible storm,

11:47.760 --> 11:50.081
and I-l went over a guardrail

11:50.240 --> 11:53.369
and then nothing for months.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.927
They said she drowned,
but they never found the body,

11:56.080 --> 11:58.731
so, uh, we never gave up hope.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.291
What a touching story.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.728
Okay, well, you must want to
get back to your van house now.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.769
Sweetie, don't be so rude.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.922
- Maybe your friends are hungry.
- Oh...

12:08.120 --> 12:09.451
Dinner's already made.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.490
Look, lady, I don't know
what game you're playing,

12:12.640 --> 12:14.961
but I want my book,
and I want it now.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.963
Uh, we'd love to stay for dinner.
That sounds great.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.122
Come on, Ash,
let's tidy up.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.805
Is this the man?

12:25.960 --> 12:27.291
Yeah, that's him.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.284
He looks way dumber in real life,
but that is very close.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.805
Ship it.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.811
Hey. Can I have a look at that?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.962
Sure.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.606
Are you the one behind all this?

12:43.760 --> 12:46.809
Amanda!
What are you doing here?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.689
Give us a second.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.844
I just thought if there's a connection
to what happened the other night--

12:52.040 --> 12:54.042
Fisher, you were
in an officer-involved shooting.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.328
You're not supposed to be anywhere near
a crime scene right now.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.448
- What does it matter?
- It matters.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.331
Now, please,
for your own good.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.164
Okay.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.324
( Rain pattering )

13:08.480 --> 13:10.847
( creaking )

13:13.320 --> 13:15.846
( eerie whispering )

13:19.440 --> 13:22.091
Um, hey, jefe...

13:25.000 --> 13:26.729
Uh, hold on.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.521
- Ugh.
- Gross. Thanks.

13:30.680 --> 13:34.605
Uh, so, forgive me but...

13:35.640 --> 13:37.961
I got a small confession.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.960
I took your book.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.329
You what?
I hope you're shittin' me.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.848
Well, I-l knew you wouldn't help Kelly
unless you thought she had it.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.207
Oh, so you just lied to me?

13:51.360 --> 13:53.044
You know,
I trusted you, Pablo!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.247
I'm sorry.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.404
But at least everything is okay
and we get a free dinner.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.206
You don't believe
Mom's horseshit story, do ya?

14:01.200 --> 14:04.090
She's a Deadite,
and I think Dad is, too.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.486
Mm-mm.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.246
Her mom, she doesn't even have
the crazy white eyes.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.210
I noticed they're brown
and lovely like her daughter's.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.091
Yeah. I remember
when I was like you--

14:14.240 --> 14:17.881
young, dumb, full of...
conflicting emotions.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.525
Look, these things are tricky.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.409
They can disguise themselves
as human

14:21.560 --> 14:23.164
and just when
you're comfortable, boom!

14:23.320 --> 14:25.004
( Thunder crashing )

14:34.960 --> 14:37.406
It's just a storm, Pablito.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.810
Look, Ash, I think you're being
really paranoid about this.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.371
If Kelly's mom
is one of them,

14:43.520 --> 14:46.046
why wouldn't she have killed her
before we got here?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.521
Because she's trying
to reel in the bigger fish.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.284
Don't you get it?

14:50.440 --> 14:53.364
If you snag a little fish,
you're not gonna eat it, no.

14:53.520 --> 14:57.081
You use it as a baitfish
to catch the whale.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.364
- I'm the whale, Pablo.
- Yeah, I got that.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.091
- And Kelly...
- She's the bait.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.322
Yeah, that's right.
Unfortunately for Mom,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.006
this whale swam in there
with a big 0l' shotgun.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.721
She was just waiting for me
to drop my guard.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.644
That's why she's
inviting us for dinner.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.963
Well, for the record...

15:21.120 --> 15:22.804
I think she's a real mom,

15:22.960 --> 15:25.201
and this is my chance
to impress Kelly's parents.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.607
So can you just
do me a solid, please?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.728
Just be polite in there.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.805
Oh, I'll be polite,
right up until I'm rude.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.363
Hey. How're you holding up?

15:38.520 --> 15:41.251
I mean, this must all be
a big shock for you.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.006
I mean,
my mom's back

15:44.160 --> 15:46.242
andlthought
I'd never see her again.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.802
So, um, I don't know.
I guess I'm actually, um...

15:49.960 --> 15:53.009
happy for once.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.322
( Kelly chuckles )

15:59.680 --> 16:01.523
♪ Ta-da. ♪

16:01.680 --> 16:03.091
Wow, Mom, it looks great.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.527
Thank you.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.251
Um, you know,
you could, uh,

16:08.440 --> 16:10.408
take off your gun,

16:10.560 --> 16:12.767
put it over there
with your chainsaw limb.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.007
You'd like that, wouldn't ya?

16:17.200 --> 16:21.046
Well, yeah. I would rather not
have a gun at dinner.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.690
Well, we can agree to disagree.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.525
This guy hunts.
He gets it, huh?

16:29.160 --> 16:33.131
Honey, I made your favorite--
roast beef, medium rare.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.123
Mom, you remembered.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.851
Well, you know, for somebody
who recently lost their memory,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.240
Yours is pretty good.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.563
Well, it, uh--
it keeps coming back in pieces.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.849
The doctor said eventually
I should regain everything.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.082
I'll bet they did.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.483
So, what are your plans, Mom?

16:51.640 --> 16:52.971
( Thunder crashing )

16:58.200 --> 17:02.364
- ( gurgling )
- I am sorry. You were saying?

17:03.800 --> 17:06.565
Well, now that you're back,
what's your big plan?

17:06.720 --> 17:10.406
Well, just try to get everything
back to normal.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.005
Kelly:
Thank you.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.167
Normal.
Huh.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.486
What's normal?

17:34.640 --> 17:37.530
- Mm, family, work.
- Work. Where?

17:37.680 --> 17:38.681
- I'm an English teacher.
- What grade?

17:38.840 --> 17:39.841
- Tenth.
- What's your favorite book?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.445
"The Old Man and the Sea."

17:41.600 --> 17:43.762
- Oh, so you like fishing?
- I like fishing.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.922
This ain't about you, Dad.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.324
What are you waiting for?
You know you want a piece of this.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.808
Pablo,
believe it or not,

17:55.960 --> 17:58.008
the rude middle-aged man
you brought

17:58.160 --> 18:00.527
is kinda ruining
my mom time.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.927
( Buzzing )

18:03.080 --> 18:05.128
Ash, you're wrong,
I'm right.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.487
Lay off.
That's her real mom.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.201
Well, can we get back to dinner

18:12.400 --> 18:15.483
or, um, did you have
some more questions for me?

18:15.640 --> 18:16.971
Seriously.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.083
Well, actually,
just one more.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.407
Oh, my God!

18:22.560 --> 18:24.403
- Honey!
- Holy shit!

18:24.560 --> 18:27.131
- Mom.
- Can you hear me?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.044
Suzy. Suzy?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.328
Honey.
Oh, God.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.370
What the fuck
is wrong with you, huh?

18:34.520 --> 18:36.807
How dare you?
You come into our house,

18:36.960 --> 18:39.361
we've got food and then, I mean...

I'm not a grief counselor,

24:04.800 --> 24:06.325
but if it's any consolation,

24:06.480 --> 24:09.609
I have had to kill
and bury loved ones before.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.404
A bunch of times, actually.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.004
This evil...

24:16.160 --> 24:18.640
it made me think
my mom was alive,

24:18.800 --> 24:20.245
killed my dad.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.045
I hate whatever did this.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.851
Yep. That was
my takeaway, too.

24:29.520 --> 24:33.286
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
I also hate this Evil.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.245
Ash, I'm not sorry
that I took your book

24:39.400 --> 24:41.323
to get you to come up here.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.641
I'm not either.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.211
Sometimes
the whale needs his baitfish

24:44.360 --> 24:47.125
to remind him of
where he is in the ocean.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.685
Or something like that.
Anyway, thanks, Pablo.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.521
Kelly, if you really hate
what did this,

24:56.720 --> 24:58.927
you should come with us.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.651
Let's bring the fight to it.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.964
I mean, I guess I don't know
what else I would do.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.361
Well, she shouldn't be alone
right now.
