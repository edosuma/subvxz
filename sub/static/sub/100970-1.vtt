01:44.229 --> 01:47.331
They stone her, Fred.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.367
You reading one
of Shirley's stories?

01:49.369 --> 01:52.670
The whole town,
even her own children.

01:52.672 --> 01:54.338
They all stone her.

01:54.340 --> 01:57.508
That's creepy.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.446
It's terrific.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.653
- That looks delicious.
- Oh, thank you.

03:51.624 --> 03:54.725
Oh!

03:54.727 --> 03:59.497
Welcome to our hallow end
of the Earth, my boy!

03:59.499 --> 04:01.766
Welcome to Bennington!

04:01.768 --> 04:03.334
Good to see you, Professor.

04:03.336 --> 04:05.235
Oh, look at this!
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.

04:05.237 --> 04:09.340
And, oh, who is
this lovely dove?

04:09.342 --> 04:11.174
Rose Nemser.
You must be Professor Hyman.

04:11.176 --> 04:14.311
Oh, Stanley.
Stanley.

04:14.313 --> 04:16.414
I profess nothing.

04:16.416 --> 04:18.248
Come, come, come, come.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.584
Let's get you watered down.

04:20.587 --> 04:23.423
I'll bring him back
in one piece, Rosie.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.691
Okay.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.906
I'm trudging back up
the hill,

04:41.908 --> 04:43.206
and I'm cursing my back.

04:43.208 --> 04:44.508
I'm cursing my feet.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.876
I'm cursing all
of goddamn humanity,

04:45.878 --> 04:49.413
and then it hit me.

04:49.415 --> 04:50.881
The whole thing.

04:50.883 --> 04:55.586
So I sat down at my desk,
and two hours later...

04:55.588 --> 04:59.790
the most reviled story "The
New Yorker" has ever printed.

04:59.792 --> 05:04.428
I read it as
an anti-Semitic parable

05:04.430 --> 05:07.230
in the tradition of Isaac Babel.

05:07.232 --> 05:11.201
Calling my wife an Anti-Semite,
are we?

05:11.203 --> 05:14.605
Well, to be fair,
she never hated a single Jew

05:14.607 --> 05:16.540
until she married me.

05:17.744 --> 05:20.911
We had a wonderful courtship.

05:20.913 --> 05:22.278
Didn't we, dear?

05:22.280 --> 05:24.615
He asked me out
for cheeseburgers.

05:24.617 --> 05:26.784
Who could refuse such a...

05:26.786 --> 05:28.753
such a romance?

05:31.289 --> 05:34.558
Next thing I know, he's ripping
apart a story of mine.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.295
Then he has the gall to tell me
that he has lost his wallet.

05:41.334 --> 05:42.900
That wallet's been lost
for over 20 years.

05:44.437 --> 05:47.605
Now, mind you, that story...

05:47.607 --> 05:51.609
was the most remarkable story
I'd ever read.

05:51.611 --> 05:56.279
I knew I was going to marry
the woman who wrote it.

05:56.281 --> 06:00.685
I was going to hunt her down
and make her marry me.

06:00.687 --> 06:05.523
To our suffering, my dear.

06:05.525 --> 06:08.426
There's not enough Scotch
in the world for that one.

06:09.629 --> 06:12.331
So, Shirley,
what are you writing now?

06:19.605 --> 06:22.940
A little novella I'm calling
"None of Your Goddamn Business."

06:27.580 --> 06:31.517
Excuse me, I'm Rose.
Rose Nemser.

06:35.421 --> 06:37.988
Betty, Debbie, Kathy...

06:37.990 --> 06:39.623
You're all the same to me.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.992
No, no. I'm Fred's wife.
Fred Nemser.

06:41.994 --> 06:44.328
He's helping Professor Hyman
with this semester.

06:44.330 --> 06:47.631
We were invited to stay here
for a few days

06:47.633 --> 06:49.635
until we could find a place.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.647
No one said you were pregnant.

07:04.050 --> 07:06.853
W-We weren't telling
anybody yet.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.657
I-I-I read your story.

07:13.659 --> 07:14.692
There have been several.

07:14.694 --> 07:17.762
"The Lottery."

07:17.764 --> 07:20.433
When I read it,
it made me feel...

07:23.035 --> 07:24.804
...thrillingly horrible.

08:29.836 --> 08:31.669
♪ Father, did you bring me
the silver? ♪

08:31.671 --> 08:33.404
♪ Father, did you bring me
the gold? ♪

08:34.841 --> 08:36.642
That was Lead Belly.

08:39.611 --> 08:41.614
Huddie Ledbetter.

08:44.817 --> 08:48.452
This is Myth and Folklore.

08:48.454 --> 08:50.187
I am Professor Stanley Hyman,

08:50.189 --> 08:53.591
your fearless leader
for the next 12 weeks

08:53.593 --> 08:57.862
as we ascend to the heights
of the gods

08:57.864 --> 09:01.932
and stoop to the very depths
of human depravity.

09:03.035 --> 09:04.535
- Oh.
- Hello.

09:04.537 --> 09:06.971
Hi.
Isn't he great?

09:06.973 --> 09:09.073
Oh, terrific.
I wish my Chaucer class

09:09.075 --> 09:10.875
that I'm auditing wasn't
at the same time.

09:10.877 --> 09:13.777
Oh, well, there will be
other semesters.

09:13.779 --> 09:15.779
Sure.

09:15.781 --> 09:17.615
Might I burden you
with a favor?

09:17.617 --> 09:19.518
Hmm. What's that?

09:23.222 --> 09:26.156
Shirley has these bouts...

09:26.158 --> 09:28.993
and just can't, uh...

09:28.995 --> 09:30.628
can't keep up...

09:30.630 --> 09:32.930
with the household, shopping,

09:32.932 --> 09:35.499
and our last housekeeper
just quit.

09:35.501 --> 09:36.567
Oh.

09:36.569 --> 09:38.903
Bad back or lungs.

09:38.905 --> 09:41.772
I don't recall.
Maybe gout?

09:41.774 --> 09:44.208
But it would be such
a titanic help

09:44.210 --> 09:47.745
if you would just tidy up a bit.
Excuse me?

09:47.747 --> 09:48.946
Maybe chip in
with the laundry...

09:48.948 --> 09:51.615
- Yes?
- ...the cooking?

09:51.617 --> 09:53.884
- Oh...
- Well, no, no, no.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.920
That's too much.

09:55.922 --> 09:57.922
Don't think I confuse you
for a scullery maid.

09:57.924 --> 10:00.257
It's just, we are
in a bit of a bind.

10:00.259 --> 10:01.825
Well, perhaps I could...

10:01.827 --> 10:03.928
I could help out
in between classes?

10:03.930 --> 10:05.863
Well, obviously, room
and board on us.

10:05.865 --> 10:07.731
- Oh, no, no, no. We couldn't.
- No, no, no. Of course.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.066
- We couldn't.
- Of course. I insist.

10:09.068 --> 10:10.501
Might you stay, hmm?

10:10.503 --> 10:13.938
Just until we're...

10:13.940 --> 10:15.508
settled in, hmm?

10:20.079 --> 10:22.880
How's your rump roast?

10:22.882 --> 10:25.518
I love hot food in hot weather.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.694
He really seems in a bind.

10:36.696 --> 10:39.198
It could be sort of fun, hmm?

10:42.902 --> 10:44.704
Or we say no.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.295
Get dressed for dinner,
darling.

12:51.297 --> 12:53.831
Please.

12:53.833 --> 12:57.835
Try.
Go away.

12:57.837 --> 13:00.003
I really think the two of them
are gonna work out.

13:00.005 --> 13:02.440
Did you see our kitchen?

13:02.442 --> 13:07.111
A clean house is evidence
of mental inferiority.

13:07.113 --> 13:08.846
Well, thank God
for the simpletons.

13:08.848 --> 13:11.115
How else would we ever
have fresh linens?

13:11.117 --> 13:13.851
You hired spies, is that it?

13:13.853 --> 13:15.686
I'm trying to help you,
Shirl.

13:15.688 --> 13:19.022
Take some of the pressure off
so you can get your work done.

13:19.024 --> 13:23.461
I don't want strangers here.
I don't like them.

13:23.463 --> 13:25.731
We've already discussed it,
dear.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.636
Hmm?

13:33.072 --> 13:34.805
Fred's going to lighten
my class load

13:34.807 --> 13:38.976
so that I can be
around the house more.

13:38.978 --> 13:40.478
Won't you like that?

13:45.951 --> 13:48.085
You can't expect me
to indulge this, can you?

13:48.087 --> 13:50.921
Hmm?

13:50.923 --> 13:53.056
Staying in bed all day?

13:53.058 --> 13:56.293
Well, the party was too much.
It set me back.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.962
You have to get back
to your desk.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.031
You're putting an undue
amount of pressure on me.

14:01.033 --> 14:03.368
Fussing over you
when I have work to do.

14:03.370 --> 14:05.938
You don't want my work
to suffer, too, do you?

14:09.074 --> 14:10.809
No.

14:24.089 --> 14:25.858
I'm going to get better.

14:28.093 --> 14:29.927
I promise.

14:29.929 --> 14:31.130
I will.

14:38.405 --> 14:41.406
Starting tomorrow.
No, starting tonight.

14:41.408 --> 14:43.807
You are putting on
clean clothes

14:43.809 --> 14:46.944
and sitting at the table
for a proper meal.

14:46.946 --> 14:49.213
- I can't.
- You will.

14:49.215 --> 14:50.983
Besides...

14:53.085 --> 14:54.851
...it's cocktail hour.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.122
Up, up, up.

15:00.493 --> 15:02.159
It's going to be so dull.

15:02.161 --> 15:06.131
Well, I didn't ask you
to behave at the table.

15:18.411 --> 15:20.411
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

15:20.413 --> 15:22.513
Oh, a gorgeous slab of flesh.

15:22.515 --> 15:24.848
Oh, it was nothing.

15:26.986 --> 15:29.186
Oh, go on, my boy.
Shed a layer.

15:29.188 --> 15:31.221
We aren't formal in this house.

15:31.223 --> 15:35.225
I've often thought
about participating

15:35.227 --> 15:38.396
in the Native American ritual
of the sweat lodge.

15:38.398 --> 15:40.831
- Thank you.
- Often?

15:40.833 --> 15:42.467
Why, yes, dear.

15:42.469 --> 15:46.003
But then I learned you have to
crawl through a dirt tunnel

15:46.005 --> 15:47.472
under the ground

15:47.474 --> 15:50.040
and sit naked buttocks
to naked buttocks

15:50.042 --> 15:53.043
with a dozen other men
while some shaman

15:53.045 --> 15:57.314
stokes a smoky fire, maintaining
the 100-degree heat

15:57.316 --> 16:01.051
and peddles some noxious
root tea

16:01.053 --> 16:03.186
that inspires hallucinations.

16:03.188 --> 16:04.323
Ooh!

16:15.267 --> 16:18.336
So when's the baby due?

16:18.338 --> 16:20.237
- The baby?
- Oops.

16:20.239 --> 16:21.606
Was it supposed to be
a surprise?

16:21.608 --> 16:25.208
You should have
told me that, dear.

16:25.210 --> 16:26.877
Well, I hope it's yours.

16:26.879 --> 16:29.212
Of course it's his.

16:29.214 --> 16:32.182
February. Hmm.
Right, darling?

16:32.184 --> 16:34.017
I would really rather discuss
something else,

16:34.019 --> 16:36.286
if you don't mind.
February? Ha.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.258
Did you tell him you were
knocked up before the wedding?

16:42.027 --> 16:44.261
I fear, my love,
stories of copulations

16:44.263 --> 16:47.498
might leave the table
without an appetite,

16:47.500 --> 16:51.636
but that one does have
a sixth sense about babies.

16:51.638 --> 16:54.672
Calls it. Girl or a boy,
she's never wrong.

16:54.674 --> 16:57.240
Is poor Freddie here
going to be disappointed?

17:13.359 --> 17:15.125
Okay. Shall I...?

17:15.127 --> 17:16.862
Stay put.

17:18.964 --> 17:20.698
You promised
to take care of that.

17:24.637 --> 17:27.571
As you wish, dear.

17:31.243 --> 17:34.379
So, Rose, you were telling us
about your shotgun wedding.

17:35.515 --> 17:38.416
Excuse me.

17:38.418 --> 17:41.920
I should see
if she's all right.

17:50.363 --> 17:53.932
I feel a bit like
we're in the Scottish play.

17:55.702 --> 17:59.437
I, the Thane of Cawdor,

17:59.439 --> 18:03.474
with a murderous prophecy
over my head.

18:03.476 --> 18:08.178
And you, Lady M...

18:08.180 --> 18:10.548
on the verge of madness.

18:10.550 --> 18:13.686
What will happen?

18:22.294 --> 18:23.561
I have a title.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.228
"Hangsaman."

18:25.230 --> 18:27.365
It's about that girl.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.566
The missing one.

18:28.568 --> 18:30.334
The Welden girl?

18:30.336 --> 18:32.002
What do you think?

18:32.004 --> 18:35.305
Well, you haven't said much.

18:35.307 --> 18:37.542
Well, it's just an idea.

18:37.544 --> 18:41.111
I can try something else.
Disappearing college girls.

18:41.113 --> 18:45.148
Sounds trite and a bit trashy,
but, you know, give it a go.

18:45.150 --> 18:48.352
I'll read, of course,
before you wade too far in.

18:48.354 --> 18:50.287
It's going to take some time.

18:50.289 --> 18:52.255
Well, give it to me
in a couple of days.

18:52.257 --> 18:55.426
It's a novel.

18:55.428 --> 18:58.763
Oh, no, dear.
That's...

18:58.765 --> 19:01.632
You're not...

19:01.634 --> 19:03.403
You're just not up to it.

19:05.472 --> 19:07.538
You're wrong.

19:07.540 --> 19:11.109
Darling, you haven't been out
of the house in two months.

19:13.078 --> 19:16.614
You're barely able to put
on a pair of stockings.

19:16.616 --> 19:19.151
Ease back.
That's all I'm saying.

19:24.791 --> 19:27.391
If that phone rings...

19:27.393 --> 19:30.595
one more time during dinner...

19:30.597 --> 19:34.264
Stanley, so help me, I'm going
to take care of it myself.

19:34.266 --> 19:36.400
I'm well within the bounds
of our agreement.

19:36.402 --> 19:38.469
Ah. Hmm.

19:38.471 --> 19:44.009
Our agreement didn't include
sluts interrupting my dinner.

19:45.812 --> 19:48.679
I will talk to her

19:48.681 --> 19:52.084
and tell you everything,
as I always do.

19:55.287 --> 19:57.622
You're really scraping
the barrel these days.

No, nothing he said is...

That's enough time.

20:56.849 --> 20:59.316
Please?

20:59.318 --> 21:01.852
Maybe she'll even out
when she gets better.

21:01.854 --> 21:04.220
No, no.
She's a fucking monster.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.624
Shh. Shh.
Hey, hey.

21:06.626 --> 21:09.727
Hey.

21:09.729 --> 21:12.496
Look at me.

21:12.498 --> 21:14.498
Look at me.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.835
Don't upset yourself.

21:17.837 --> 21:19.772
It's a big opportunity for us.

21:25.778 --> 21:27.878
Do you like your students?

21:27.880 --> 21:30.416
I like you.

21:34.487 --> 21:36.252
Are they smarter,
do you think...

21:36.254 --> 21:39.222
- Smarter? No.
- ...than my class?

21:39.224 --> 21:40.727
No.

21:43.796 --> 21:45.197
Just richer.

22:01.547 --> 22:04.849
"Always wore a red coat.

22:04.851 --> 22:07.652
Last seen at the trailhead.

22:07.654 --> 22:11.287
Paula was 17
and already disappointed.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.757
The dread of going
to college..."

22:12.759 --> 22:14.959
No.

22:14.961 --> 22:18.261
"She was 17, an age
that brought with it

22:18.263 --> 22:21.332
the possibility
of her whole life ahead..."

22:21.334 --> 22:23.367
Fuck.
"...that brought with it

22:23.369 --> 22:25.803
the stabbing nervousness
that at any moment

22:25.805 --> 22:27.805
her life would go horribly..."

22:27.807 --> 22:29.607
Fuck!

22:29.609 --> 22:30.975
I found that article
that links the tonality

22:30.977 --> 22:32.610
of the Druid dirges

22:32.612 --> 22:34.412
to the Appalachian
mourning ballads

22:34.414 --> 22:37.415
in the second volume
of Francis Child's collection.

22:37.417 --> 22:39.717
Well, that's grand.
Just grand.

22:39.719 --> 22:41.585
Yes. Yes. That's what I was
cross-referencing...

22:41.587 --> 22:42.787
Milk?

22:42.789 --> 22:45.856
...in chapter 7
of my dissertation.

22:45.858 --> 22:48.659
I'm not sure if you had the
opportunity to read that yet.

22:48.661 --> 22:49.960
Good god, son.

22:49.962 --> 22:52.197
Might I have a cup
of coffee in peace?

22:59.572 --> 23:03.340
Mm.

23:03.342 --> 23:05.543
Well...

23:05.545 --> 23:09.312
Keep an eye on the missus
for me, won't you, dear?

23:09.314 --> 23:10.414
Mwah.

23:10.416 --> 23:13.417
Of course, Professor.

23:13.419 --> 23:15.352
Stop that this instant.

23:15.354 --> 23:17.688
Mrs. Nemser, Stanley.

23:17.690 --> 23:19.757
Stanley, hmm?

23:19.759 --> 23:21.527
Don't make me tell you again.

23:24.731 --> 23:26.499
Okay.

24:06.572 --> 24:10.775
You want to see
what a writer does?

24:10.777 --> 24:13.511
Absolutely nothing.

24:13.513 --> 24:16.783
Come here.
Come here!

24:19.418 --> 24:23.921
Look for anything
with fertility,

24:23.923 --> 24:27.892
maternity or full moon
in the title.

24:27.894 --> 24:31.695
Alright.

24:31.697 --> 24:33.866
I'm a witch.
Didn't anyone tell you?

24:35.768 --> 24:37.835
Happy, healthy baby.

24:37.837 --> 24:40.439
That's the spell we need.

24:43.676 --> 24:45.878
Unless you want a spell
for the other thing.

24:49.515 --> 24:53.717
How... How could you
even say that?

24:53.719 --> 24:55.788
Motherhood comes with a price,
you know.

25:08.701 --> 25:11.836
Here.

25:11.838 --> 25:15.005
Cut them.

25:15.007 --> 25:17.842
Go on.

25:17.844 --> 25:19.612
They won't bite.

25:25.985 --> 25:27.753
Sit.

26:35.655 --> 26:37.456
What did you see?

26:50.236 --> 26:52.670
"Paula.

26:52.672 --> 26:54.772
Paula preferred to keep
her expectations

26:54.774 --> 26:56.774
of people meager at best.

26:56.776 --> 26:59.543
Why should she be
constantly taken in?

26:59.545 --> 27:02.613
Why should she be
constantly disappointed?

27:02.615 --> 27:06.583
Yet she couldn't help but
wonder, what was she missing?

27:06.585 --> 27:09.687
This... This...

27:09.689 --> 27:14.091
This doubt was intensified by
the girl with the sweater set

27:14.093 --> 27:16.095
sitting across from her
at dinner."

27:20.766 --> 27:22.501
Shirley?

28:17.223 --> 28:18.956
What are you doing in here?

28:18.958 --> 28:20.958
I'm sorry. I thought I'd bring
you coffee. I'm sorry.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.092
Get out!

28:22.094 --> 28:23.761
Get out!

28:23.763 --> 28:25.262
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:25.264 --> 28:27.664
Don't touch my writing.
Don't touch anything!

28:27.666 --> 28:29.199
Get out!

29:19.718 --> 29:22.820
You're drunk.

29:22.822 --> 29:24.088
I thought you were meant
to be advising

29:24.090 --> 29:26.123
the Shakespeare Society.

29:26.125 --> 29:30.127
I didn't know they served
booze at that.

29:30.129 --> 29:31.995
They don't.
Don't be stupid.

29:31.997 --> 29:35.833
I just stopped for a few drinks
at the men's club, that's all.

29:35.835 --> 29:37.734
Oh.

29:37.736 --> 29:40.871
Who's the jealous housewife?

29:40.873 --> 29:42.940
Oh!
Mm.

29:42.942 --> 29:45.242
Ahh. Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.

29:45.244 --> 29:47.347
Bedtime.

29:58.190 --> 29:59.923
Is it because...?

29:59.925 --> 30:02.061
No. No.
You're beautiful.

30:54.113 --> 30:56.782
I had a crazy dream.

30:59.084 --> 31:01.785
There was mud oozing
from the fridge.

31:01.787 --> 31:04.489
Big worms coming out of the...

31:04.491 --> 31:08.058
coming out of the crisper,

31:08.060 --> 31:10.796
just fat as fingers.

31:16.302 --> 31:18.338
Freud would've had a field day.

31:22.475 --> 31:26.143
- I haven't read any.
- Do you regret it?

31:26.145 --> 31:28.111
Not reading Freud?

31:28.113 --> 31:30.881
And dropping out.

31:30.883 --> 31:33.786
I'm keeping up,
reading what I can.

31:38.891 --> 31:43.126
After the baby, Fred says
I can go back to school.

31:43.128 --> 31:47.365
He's allowing you.
Wow.

31:47.367 --> 31:50.968
Was he at the
Shakespeare Society tonight?

31:50.970 --> 31:53.471
Fred's a good man.

31:53.473 --> 31:56.006
So you've said.

31:56.008 --> 31:58.244
His parents cut him off
when we eloped.

32:00.212 --> 32:04.081
And he knew they would...

32:04.083 --> 32:06.216
but he married me anyway.

32:06.218 --> 32:12.191
And you have to prove
that you're worth it.

32:13.393 --> 32:16.527
Yeah.

32:16.529 --> 32:18.195
It sounds exhausting.

32:35.147 --> 32:36.982
I'm lost, Rosie.

32:41.354 --> 32:43.222
I'm lost.

32:50.262 --> 32:52.831
Do you know what it's like
to have a secret?

32:56.902 --> 33:00.371
I can't write worth a damn.

33:00.373 --> 33:02.906
You're a terrific writer.

33:02.908 --> 33:04.877
Everyone loves your work.

33:10.115 --> 33:11.850
They talk...

33:14.521 --> 33:17.522
...about me...

33:17.524 --> 33:21.058
in town.

33:21.060 --> 33:23.461
I see things on people's faces.

33:23.463 --> 33:29.166
They're afraid to brush up
against me.

33:29.168 --> 33:34.139
My dark, my thoughts
are going to infect them.

33:36.275 --> 33:39.209
This book, it's...

33:39.211 --> 33:40.511
It might kill me.

33:40.513 --> 33:42.549
I can't figure out this girl.

33:46.218 --> 33:48.085
Maybe disappearing
was the only way

33:48.087 --> 33:49.589
anyone would notice her.

34:02.635 --> 34:04.267
I need you to run
an errand for me.

34:04.269 --> 34:07.170
Christ.

34:07.172 --> 34:08.639
Oh, so the writing's
going well then?

34:08.641 --> 34:11.975
Please don't ever ask me
that again.

34:11.976 --> 34:14.478
I need you to run up to campus.

34:14.481 --> 34:16.045
Okay, I can send Fred.

34:16.047 --> 34:19.248
No.
No, this is between us.

34:19.251 --> 34:22.284
Stanley doesn't really want you
being alone right now.

34:22.286 --> 34:23.420
- Forget it.
- No.

34:23.422 --> 34:25.121
Forget I ever asked.

34:25.123 --> 34:27.090
I just thought you would like
a little adventure.

34:27.092 --> 34:29.560
I'm simply saying
that I would go with you

34:29.562 --> 34:31.995
if you wanted an outing.

34:31.996 --> 34:35.197
Like a picnic?

34:35.199 --> 34:38.569
Do you want to make up
some egg salad sandwiches?

34:38.571 --> 34:40.340
Fly a kite while we're at it?

34:45.110 --> 34:47.177
Please?

34:47.179 --> 34:48.679
Do this for me.

36:06.058 --> 36:08.392
"Paula normally hated
socializing at school,

36:08.394 --> 36:11.662
but she forced herself
to do it."

36:11.664 --> 36:14.499
- Hi, Caroline.
- Good day, Mrs. Nemser.

36:14.501 --> 36:18.235
My, you are a voracious reader.

36:18.237 --> 36:20.505
You know, you and Fred
should come to the house.

36:20.507 --> 36:22.573
The Dean and I would love
to have you.

36:22.575 --> 36:26.410
Plus, it must be rather dull
for young folks like you

36:26.412 --> 36:29.847
to spend all your time with...

36:29.849 --> 36:32.350
with that woman, I mean.

36:32.352 --> 36:34.519
I hear she never
leaves the house.

36:34.521 --> 36:36.754
Or her bed, for that matter.

36:36.756 --> 36:38.789
She's gone sick in the head.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.324
No, she's...

36:40.326 --> 36:42.426
she's working quite hard.

36:42.428 --> 36:45.262
Every hour, every day.

36:45.264 --> 36:47.600
I only get my information
from Stanley.

36:50.803 --> 36:52.770
"She was relieved to spot
someone lurking

36:52.772 --> 36:54.170
near the punchbowl,

36:54.172 --> 36:56.374
looking as miserable
as she felt,

36:56.376 --> 36:59.710
but his was a face that she'd
never seen before on campus.

36:59.712 --> 37:02.346
And men were always
easily spotted."

37:02.348 --> 37:05.650
- Hyman house, huh?
- Yes, sir.

37:05.652 --> 37:09.620
I can't get my carriers
to deliver up there anymore.

37:09.622 --> 37:13.357
She writes stories
with cannibalism in it.

37:13.359 --> 37:14.761
That's what I've heard.

37:18.431 --> 37:20.698
Mr. Fisher, do you...

37:20.700 --> 37:24.802
do you, um,
often give young girls rides

37:24.804 --> 37:26.337
in your postal truck?

37:31.176 --> 37:34.311
I'm not sure
I like your question.

37:34.313 --> 37:35.646
Well, I just mean,

37:35.648 --> 37:38.382
is it a habit of yours
to shuttle college girls

37:38.384 --> 37:41.485
along your route?

37:41.487 --> 37:44.522
"Paula was proud of the way
she contradicted him,

37:44.524 --> 37:47.325
how she stayed ahead
of the conversation.

37:47.327 --> 37:51.929
This is what it's like to be
a grown woman talking to a man."

37:51.931 --> 37:55.298
I never seen Paula
before that day in my life.

37:55.300 --> 37:57.368
Giving her a ride was
the Samaritan thing to do.

37:57.370 --> 38:01.204
The girl was half frozen,
nothing but thin sneakers on.

38:01.206 --> 38:02.707
Said she was going for a hike,

38:02.709 --> 38:05.443
and I wasn't going to get
any further into her business.

38:05.445 --> 38:07.345
But I didn't like that,
seeing it was almost sundown.

38:07.347 --> 38:09.914
She had no knapsack.
She had no provisions.

38:09.916 --> 38:13.351
I assumed she must've been
meeting someone.

38:13.353 --> 38:15.953
"When they were at the party,
he had barely looked at her.

38:15.955 --> 38:18.356
His voice had a lightness.

38:18.358 --> 38:20.223
'Let's go somewhere quieter, '
he said.

38:20.225 --> 38:23.694
A hand on her back.

38:23.696 --> 38:25.529
But now...

38:25.531 --> 38:27.465
But now, away from everyone...

38:27.467 --> 38:31.201
his voice was muted,
floating above her.

38:31.203 --> 38:33.371
And she couldn't..."

38:34.607 --> 38:36.376
"...she couldn't contradict him.

38:39.912 --> 38:41.681
Are you all right?

39:19.619 --> 39:21.754
Oh, you little thief.

39:24.924 --> 39:28.726
Severe menstrual cramps,
last week of November.

39:28.728 --> 39:30.995
Yeah.

39:30.997 --> 39:34.297
Doesn't go home for the holiday.

39:34.299 --> 39:35.802
Meaning?

39:38.638 --> 39:41.839
Meaning?

39:41.841 --> 39:43.841
A miscarriage.

39:43.843 --> 39:46.244
And a week later,
she goes missing.

39:48.815 --> 39:52.282
That's good work, Rosie.

39:52.284 --> 39:53.851
And the post office?

39:53.853 --> 39:57.757
Randy Fisher said that he
thought she was meeting someone.

40:00.626 --> 40:03.293
The timing is perfect.

40:03.295 --> 40:05.429
She gets pregnant.

40:05.431 --> 40:08.432
She won't go home
for Thanksgiving.

40:08.434 --> 40:11.469
A week later, there's
a rendezvous in the woods.

40:11.471 --> 40:12.972
Why there?

40:18.678 --> 40:22.813
Because she's ashamed to have
someone meet her at campus

40:22.815 --> 40:26.419
or he doesn't want
to be seen there.

40:29.689 --> 40:31.756
Because other people
might recognize him.

40:31.758 --> 40:35.493
Someone recognizable
from campus.

40:35.495 --> 40:38.696
- Yes.
- Yes.

40:38.698 --> 40:41.899
Someone with authority.

40:41.901 --> 40:45.903
"Meet me at the trail,"
and she does.

40:45.905 --> 40:48.606
A professor.

40:48.608 --> 40:50.576
Why would she go?

40:54.914 --> 40:56.682
If you were her...

40:58.584 --> 41:04.822
...and an accomplished,
confident, smart man...

41:04.824 --> 41:08.359
paid attention to you...

41:08.361 --> 41:09.896
You'd never really been in love.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.469
Would you go?

43:14.186 --> 43:17.554
Shirley?
Are you all right?

43:17.556 --> 43:19.992
Are you okay in there?

43:41.213 --> 43:42.713
Did I startle you, Rosie?

43:42.715 --> 43:46.550
I-I thought...
I thought you were...

43:46.552 --> 43:48.786
It's just we three for dinner.

43:48.788 --> 43:52.089
Oh, wait. Two.
Shirley doesn't want to eat.

43:52.091 --> 43:54.124
Fred's up on campus tonight

43:54.126 --> 43:55.626
advising
the Shakespeare Society.

43:55.628 --> 43:57.261
I'll make her a plate.

43:57.263 --> 43:59.797
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

43:59.799 --> 44:02.501
If she wants to eat,
she needs to come to the table.

44:04.270 --> 44:05.869
Sure.

44:07.740 --> 44:10.541
Oh, no, thank you.

44:10.543 --> 44:11.608
Mm.

44:11.610 --> 44:13.143
Well, she's not a child,
Stanley.

44:13.145 --> 44:15.980
Who's saying she is?

44:15.982 --> 44:18.983
We just have to get her back
to her desk, back to her work.

44:18.985 --> 44:20.250
She's working constantly.

44:20.252 --> 44:22.188
She barely has time for lunch.

44:29.128 --> 44:30.728
Poor thing.

44:30.730 --> 44:33.897
She must really be having
a time of it.

44:33.899 --> 44:35.866
I haven't seen anything yet.

44:37.269 --> 44:39.570
Well, there are pages and pages
of a manuscript

44:39.572 --> 44:41.507
just sitting right on her desk.

44:43.843 --> 44:46.010
You've read it?

44:46.012 --> 44:49.780
No.
No, of course not.

44:49.782 --> 44:51.615
But...

44:51.617 --> 44:54.687
you can differentiate a stack
of pages from a manuscript?

44:56.989 --> 44:59.656
Such a bright girl.

44:59.658 --> 45:01.627
Is there any of our pie left?

45:03.629 --> 45:06.999
Rosie says you've got half
a manuscript already.

45:13.039 --> 45:16.073
I wonder why
she would say that.

45:16.075 --> 45:17.174
Just inquiring, darling.

45:17.176 --> 45:18.809
You're not...

45:18.811 --> 45:20.946
halfway through a novel
you haven't shown me?

45:25.385 --> 45:28.052
No.

45:28.054 --> 45:29.722
No, I don't.

45:32.124 --> 45:35.793
It's mostly grocery lists.

45:35.795 --> 45:37.895
Well, in that case,

45:37.897 --> 45:41.267
I'll just pop over to the Dean's
before dinner.

45:42.802 --> 45:44.234
You do that.

45:56.349 --> 45:58.784
Say hello to Caroline.

46:12.898 --> 46:14.633
Shirley?

46:22.808 --> 46:24.310
Shirley?

46:35.455 --> 46:37.823
Hey, let's go home.

46:40.192 --> 46:41.927
Come on.

46:48.067 --> 46:51.135
The death cap mushroom.

46:51.137 --> 46:54.106
Fatal to anyone who ingests it.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.414
Don't you find it exhilarating?

47:03.416 --> 47:07.151
Oh, most young women are
fascinated by their mortality.

47:07.153 --> 47:09.887
They shouldn't be.

47:09.889 --> 47:13.225
And the truth is, nobody really
cares if you live or if you die.

47:23.470 --> 47:26.238
- Do you want to taste it?
- No.

47:31.977 --> 47:33.712
Split it with me.

47:41.521 --> 47:43.989
It could stop our hearts
from beating.

48:03.242 --> 48:06.477
Shirley!
Spit it out!

48:06.479 --> 48:08.479
Spit it out right now!
Spit it out!

48:08.481 --> 48:10.047
- No.
- I'm going to go get help.

48:11.817 --> 48:14.452
What?
Why are you laughing?

48:14.454 --> 48:17.422
It's not poisonous.

48:17.424 --> 48:19.056
But you said it was the...

48:19.058 --> 48:22.125
- It's not going to kill me.
- ...the death cap.

48:22.127 --> 48:24.395
These are the death cap
mushrooms.

48:24.397 --> 48:27.030
These are oyster mushrooms.

48:27.032 --> 48:29.168
You had them
in your omelet yesterday.

48:35.542 --> 48:37.309
I like you, Rosie.

48:41.146 --> 48:42.982
Why would I want to harm you?

48:48.421 --> 48:51.321
You could run...

48:51.323 --> 48:54.293
run fast away from me,
but you don't.

48:57.263 --> 48:58.998
Why don't you?

49:02.901 --> 49:04.404
Why do you stay?

49:13.112 --> 49:14.813
Can I trust you, Rosie?

49:22.555 --> 49:24.290
Do you want to betray me?

50:11.170 --> 50:14.237
"Paula felt that no one
really cared if she lived

50:14.239 --> 50:15.939
or if she died.

50:15.941 --> 50:18.208
Not that she
was afraid of death.

50:18.210 --> 50:20.210
She thought about it
all the time.

50:20.212 --> 50:22.979
It was the way she might die
that frightened her.

50:22.981 --> 50:24.582
Ingloriously...

50:24.584 --> 50:27.284
face down in the soup."

50:27.286 --> 50:29.986
I stopped by
the Dean's office today.

50:29.988 --> 50:31.221
Just a formality.

50:31.223 --> 50:33.023
Welcoming new faculty
and all that.

50:33.025 --> 50:35.025
He hinted there might be
an opening

50:35.027 --> 50:36.694
in the English Department
next fall.

50:36.696 --> 50:40.163
- Oh, that would be nice.
- Yes.

50:40.165 --> 50:42.966
I just keep waiting for Stanley
to loosen the reins a bit.

50:42.968 --> 50:46.872
I am not a lackey, after all.

50:48.307 --> 50:50.209
I have lectures
prepared of my own.

50:52.379 --> 50:54.614
Don't want to sit
on the bench all season.

50:58.183 --> 51:00.353
Ow! What the fuck is this?
What?

51:03.088 --> 51:05.088
Oh, no, no, no.
There's a nest under the bed.

51:05.090 --> 51:06.591
No, it's nettle.
It's nettle.

51:06.593 --> 51:09.660
- I'm getting a broom.
- It's a fertility offering.

51:09.662 --> 51:12.963
- What?
- It's a fertility offering.

51:12.965 --> 51:14.732
No. No.

51:14.734 --> 51:18.137
You are not getting
into that bullshit.

51:21.708 --> 51:23.674
I'm not getting into anything.
Just leave it be.

51:23.676 --> 51:25.543
- No.
- I'm sorry.

51:25.545 --> 51:27.310
She did this.

51:27.312 --> 51:29.447
What is this, some sort of hex?

51:29.449 --> 51:31.749
No, I don't believe that.

51:31.751 --> 51:34.017
You don't believe in it?

51:34.019 --> 51:36.621
Hmm? Hmm?

51:36.623 --> 51:39.359
Rosie?
No.

51:42.995 --> 51:46.431
Not one bit?

51:46.433 --> 51:48.167
Not at all?

51:57.343 --> 52:00.578
Not...

52:00.580 --> 52:02.348
one...

52:05.452 --> 52:08.619
Not even a little bit?

52:08.621 --> 52:10.721
Stop it.
I'm tired.

52:10.723 --> 52:14.024
Can we stay on a little longer?

52:14.026 --> 52:15.593
I need to keep working
on Stanley.

52:15.595 --> 52:17.428
Would you mind?

52:17.430 --> 52:21.298
Don't get any ideas.

52:21.300 --> 52:22.733
Not even a little idea?

52:22.735 --> 52:26.437
Five-minute idea?

52:26.439 --> 52:28.372
Wake me early.

52:28.374 --> 52:30.608
Mm. Mm.

52:30.610 --> 52:32.645
Stop it.
I'm sleeping.

54:28.293 --> 54:32.262
You want to replace my Mourning
Ballads lecture with your own?

54:32.264 --> 54:33.296
Of course I'm not
going to touch

54:33.298 --> 54:34.398
any of the Delta spirituals.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.834
Freddie, Freddie.

54:36.836 --> 54:39.169
Let things settle, shall we?

54:39.171 --> 54:40.338
There's one other thing.

54:40.340 --> 54:42.305
Oh, joy.
There's more.

54:44.477 --> 54:47.411
I would like you to read
my dissertation.

54:47.413 --> 54:48.879
Son, easy.

54:48.881 --> 54:50.748
You're under a lot of pressure
with the baby.

54:50.750 --> 54:53.283
No, no. This has nothing to do
with the baby.

54:53.285 --> 54:54.821
I would like you to recommend
my work to your editor.

54:58.491 --> 54:59.824
Of course I've read
your dissertation.

54:59.826 --> 55:01.792
Of course I have.

55:01.794 --> 55:05.496
Well, how did you think
you got this job?

55:05.498 --> 55:06.964
Alright, good talk.

55:06.966 --> 55:10.368
Now run out that steam, hmm?

55:10.370 --> 55:12.603
Vigors of youth!

55:12.605 --> 55:14.340
Wasted on the young.

55:20.647 --> 55:24.314
Shirl!

55:24.316 --> 55:27.818
That boy who's had everything
handed to him...

55:27.820 --> 55:30.988
Ivy education, perfect teeth.

55:30.990 --> 55:32.957
We would never behave like that.

55:32.959 --> 55:36.226
- Alka-Seltzer.
- We were always the outsiders.

55:36.228 --> 55:38.261
Everywhere we went,
we fought for every

55:38.263 --> 55:41.465
last crumb that was accidentally
dropped in our path,

55:41.467 --> 55:43.567
but these entitled pricks

55:43.569 --> 55:45.569
just expect the world
to be handed to them

55:45.571 --> 55:47.338
like it's their divine right.

55:47.340 --> 55:49.272
Why don't you just
give him a lecture?

55:49.274 --> 55:51.342
What's the harm?
I built that class.

55:51.344 --> 55:53.944
I built that department.
Year upon year, I did that,

55:53.946 --> 55:58.482
and he dashes off
some mediocre dissertation.

55:58.484 --> 56:01.686
- Which you didn't read.
- I didn't need to!

56:01.688 --> 56:03.688
Just tell him no.

56:06.793 --> 56:08.592
No.

56:08.594 --> 56:11.294
He's played the system.

56:11.296 --> 56:14.266
Over my dead body will
that boy be getting tenure.

56:19.439 --> 56:22.642
Give him enough rope,
and he will hang himself.

56:26.913 --> 56:29.682
- Good point.
- Mm-hmm.

56:30.917 --> 56:33.386
You're getting on well
with the wifey.

56:35.421 --> 56:37.255
She has her moments.

56:40.593 --> 56:44.995
I might say you are
smitten with her.

56:44.997 --> 56:47.398

Can anyone identify

No.

58:28.668 --> 58:31.101
Do we need to hear it again?

Thank you.

59:57.189 --> 59:58.891
Cheers.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.897
I was reading my way through
your dissertation last night.

01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:10.868
I've actually read it twice.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:14.571
Both times, last night.
You were right.

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:15.940
I only skimmed it before,

01:00:15.942 --> 01:00:18.909
but it was sufficient
to hire you.

01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:20.678
Oh, that's excellent.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.846
I'm trying to figure the word
I'd use to sum it up.

01:00:22.848 --> 01:00:24.715
Well, you can use several.

01:00:24.717 --> 01:00:27.017
I thought it was very engaging
for an academic...

01:00:27.019 --> 01:00:29.954
I've got it.

01:00:29.956 --> 01:00:32.024
Let's see.
It was...

01:00:34.126 --> 01:00:35.861
...derivative.

01:00:39.532 --> 01:00:41.932
I-In... In what ways
is it derivative?

01:00:41.934 --> 01:00:46.670
Oh, in the ways that it was
all derived from others' work.

01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:50.874
I spent years and years and
hundreds of hours of research...

01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:52.176
read everything.
Yes.

01:00:52.178 --> 01:00:55.145
I'm sure.
But you didn't do any thinking.

01:00:55.147 --> 01:00:58.082
Just the same old chattering on,
no new ideas.

01:00:58.084 --> 01:01:00.684
No new ideas?
I think you're oversimplifying.

01:01:00.686 --> 01:01:02.119
Darling, you're hardly
the first person

01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:03.887
to hear this lecture.

01:01:03.889 --> 01:01:08.092
Originality isn't something
one can simply will to manifest.

01:01:08.094 --> 01:01:09.960
Is that right, my dear?
If it were only true.

01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:11.695
No.

01:01:11.697 --> 01:01:16.266
Originality is
the brilliant alchemy

01:01:16.268 --> 01:01:20.604
of critical thought
and creativity.

01:01:20.606 --> 01:01:22.775
And your work is so original?

01:01:25.044 --> 01:01:27.011
Who am I to say?

01:01:27.013 --> 01:01:30.681
But it has been said of me.

01:01:30.683 --> 01:01:32.616
Have you ever thought
about teaching

01:01:32.618 --> 01:01:34.184
at the high school level?

01:01:34.186 --> 01:01:35.719
Exceedingly rewarding.

01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:38.557
I'm going in the bedroom
to refresh my...

01:01:45.965 --> 01:01:47.800
Now you've done it.

01:01:51.037 --> 01:01:53.005
Was it really that bad?

01:01:55.074 --> 01:01:59.043
You know how insulted I am
by mediocrity.

01:01:59.045 --> 01:02:03.947
If it was awful,
it would've been exciting.

01:02:03.949 --> 01:02:07.787
But terrifically competent...

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:13.059
...there's no excuse for that.

01:02:16.162 --> 01:02:17.694
I respect your opinion.

01:02:17.696 --> 01:02:20.130
I really do, but it's not shared
by the Dean.

01:02:20.132 --> 01:02:22.032
Not at all.

01:02:22.034 --> 01:02:24.201
Perhaps we can discuss this
next Friday

01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:26.003
at the faculty party?

01:02:26.005 --> 01:02:28.972
- Splendid.
- It's that time of year again.

01:02:28.974 --> 01:02:30.774
The Dean's party.

01:02:30.776 --> 01:02:33.043
Oh, no need to bother, darling.

01:02:33.045 --> 01:02:36.280
I know how you abhor
the hoi polloi.

01:02:36.282 --> 01:02:40.050
Oh, I think I can make
my annual appearance, darling.

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:42.088
It's the least I can do for you.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:45.923
I have a lead on an apartment.

01:02:45.925 --> 01:02:47.392
We'll be out
before semester break.

01:02:47.394 --> 01:02:49.159
If you get the job
in the English Department,

01:02:49.161 --> 01:02:50.894
we're going to have to see them
all the time,

01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:53.130
live in the same town,
so just take the...

01:02:53.132 --> 01:02:55.966
I don't understand. You...
First, you want to go.

01:02:55.968 --> 01:02:57.701
Now I want to, and you're...
and you're trying to...

01:02:57.703 --> 01:02:59.670
I don't like the way
he talks to you

01:02:59.672 --> 01:03:01.004
any more than you do.

01:03:01.006 --> 01:03:02.875
This is about Shirley.

01:03:04.977 --> 01:03:06.143
What?

01:03:06.145 --> 01:03:09.079
I can see
how she relies on you.

01:03:09.081 --> 01:03:12.318
The way she talks to you,
your secret looks.

01:03:13.252 --> 01:03:15.921
You sound crazy.
She's my friend.

01:03:17.457 --> 01:03:19.756
Women like Shirley
don't have friends.

01:03:39.044 --> 01:03:41.912
If we are going to be
treated to a scene,

01:03:41.914 --> 01:03:45.883
I, for one, would love
to be forewarned.

01:03:45.885 --> 01:03:48.018
I'm not one for dramatics.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.422
Yet your appearance.

01:03:51.724 --> 01:03:53.360
You don't look up for it,
my dear.

01:03:58.431 --> 01:04:00.898
I'm going to the party.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.901
Well, that would require
you leaving the house.

01:04:03.903 --> 01:04:05.969
Something that seems
difficult for you

01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:08.107
to manage at this point in time.

01:04:16.115 --> 01:04:19.417
I am going...

01:04:19.419 --> 01:04:21.954
to that party.

01:05:09.902 --> 01:05:12.304
Shirley, do you need me
to get you another size?

01:05:14.273 --> 01:05:16.173
Here.

01:05:16.175 --> 01:05:18.509
I found something that I think
is going to look good on you.

01:05:18.511 --> 01:05:21.546
You want to try it on?
Hmm?

01:05:21.548 --> 01:05:24.881
What do you think?

01:05:24.883 --> 01:05:26.950
Hmm?

01:05:26.952 --> 01:05:28.386
Here.

01:05:56.181 --> 01:05:59.617
See?

01:05:59.619 --> 01:06:02.520
Stunning.

01:06:14.467 --> 01:06:17.535
Do you think
she killed herself?

01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:19.202
Paula?

01:06:27.246 --> 01:06:30.113
Do you think she went
to the woods to kill herself?

01:06:57.344 --> 01:06:59.276
Let's pray for a boy.

01:07:05.217 --> 01:07:08.386
The world is too cruel to girls.

01:07:46.426 --> 01:07:49.327
"Paula was seized with the
desire to tell her friend

01:07:49.329 --> 01:07:52.062
every single thought
she had ever had.

01:07:52.064 --> 01:07:54.197
And after she had done that,

01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:57.033
Paula herself would cease
to exist

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.537
because there would be
no more thoughts,

01:07:59.539 --> 01:08:02.105
no more words.

01:08:02.107 --> 01:08:07.978
And then she would be free
to do anything she pleased...

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.215
because she wasn't there
anymore.

01:08:55.795 --> 01:08:58.028
Come here.

01:08:58.029 --> 01:08:59.630
Come here.

01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:11.743
You are hiding something.

01:09:16.215 --> 01:09:18.250
- No, I'm not.
- Hmm.

01:10:32.458 --> 01:10:35.225
And you find that
every semester?

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:54.480
Darling, you're making
a mess of your meal.

01:10:56.883 --> 01:10:58.716
Did you know your wife
was such a good cook

01:10:58.718 --> 01:11:00.451
before you married her?

01:11:00.453 --> 01:11:01.919
She's a better cook
than my mother.

01:11:01.921 --> 01:11:04.187
Oh, come now.
That's not true.

01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:07.290
Such a rare thing...

01:11:07.292 --> 01:11:10.628
to find someone who doesn't
merely feed you,

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:16.166
but anticipates
your needs day after day

01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:18.803
to sate your hunger.

01:11:18.805 --> 01:11:22.607
Who stokes your appetite
and leaves you feeling...

01:11:22.609 --> 01:11:24.377
filled.

01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:28.546
It's truly rare.

01:11:28.548 --> 01:11:30.315
Don't you think, Stanley?

01:11:31.551 --> 01:11:33.884
Hmm.

01:11:33.886 --> 01:11:35.622
Rare, indeed.

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:39.824
Stanley, would you refill
our cook's glass?

01:11:39.826 --> 01:11:41.592
She has been on
her feet all day.

01:11:41.594 --> 01:11:43.427
No, I suddenly got very tired.

01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:45.596
I think I'm going to have to...

01:11:45.598 --> 01:11:47.533
- Oh.
- ...go up to bed.

01:11:49.602 --> 01:11:52.403
Well, you might have a fever
or something.

01:11:52.405 --> 01:11:54.438
Come here.
Yes, you might.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.840
You know, you're feeling
a little flush.

01:11:55.842 --> 01:11:57.975
I don't have anything.
I'm just tired.

01:11:57.977 --> 01:12:02.214
- Yeah.
- I swear, I'm just tired.

01:12:06.552 --> 01:12:08.686
Fred, you better go
put your wife to bed

01:12:08.688 --> 01:12:11.189
before she faints
in the sauerkraut.

01:12:18.731 --> 01:12:20.466
What are you up to?

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.772
You're unusually cheerful.

01:12:32.345 --> 01:12:33.946
You're going to
finish your book?

01:12:39.652 --> 01:12:41.387
So...

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:51.931
...what becomes
of your dear heroine?

01:13:00.339 --> 01:13:02.709
What happens to all lost girls?

01:13:05.411 --> 01:13:06.844
They go mad.

01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:31.802
The one, the only...
Shirley Jackson.

01:13:31.804 --> 01:13:33.337
Dean Sands.

01:13:33.339 --> 01:13:35.506
Caroline!
Shirley's here.

01:13:35.508 --> 01:13:38.576
Hello!
What a lovely skirt you have.

01:13:38.578 --> 01:13:40.878
What a lovely insouciant
tone you have.

01:13:43.015 --> 01:13:44.648
Shirley, you're too much.

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:46.951
I never know what
you're going to say.

01:13:46.953 --> 01:13:50.320
Neither do I.

01:13:50.322 --> 01:13:53.357
Rose, I'd love you meet
some of the other faculty wives.

01:13:53.359 --> 01:13:54.625
Come.
Come, darling.

01:13:54.627 --> 01:13:57.394
- Hello.
- The Wood-Sprite.

01:13:57.396 --> 01:14:00.397
You terrify me.

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:01.832
Reading your stories...

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:05.770
the world doesn't feel the same.

01:14:05.772 --> 01:14:08.472
The other night,
I was alone in my office,

01:14:08.474 --> 01:14:12.543
and I was petrified
by the paperweight on my desk.

01:14:12.545 --> 01:14:17.016
What if I simply lifted it up
and bashed my skull in?

01:14:18.651 --> 01:14:20.985
How do you do that?

01:14:20.987 --> 01:14:22.586
They're just stories.

01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:24.688
No.
They are prophecies.

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.924
Delightful little
entertainments

01:14:26.926 --> 01:14:28.926
but prophecies nonetheless.

01:14:30.797 --> 01:14:33.764
Oh, here we go!

01:14:36.002 --> 01:14:37.668
♪ The stars were bright ♪

01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:39.403
♪ My heart was light ♪

01:14:39.405 --> 01:14:42.473
♪ As we went whirling

01:14:49.649 --> 01:14:56.921
♪ The dance of love ♪

Oh, ho, ho, ho!

01:15:38.764 --> 01:15:40.531
Want a Scotch?

01:15:40.533 --> 01:15:44.101
What are you doing
at this shindy?

01:15:44.103 --> 01:15:46.604
My husband,
I'm looking for him.

01:15:46.606 --> 01:15:47.771
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:47.773 --> 01:15:50.140
We're all big fans
of your husband.

01:15:50.142 --> 01:15:52.977
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

01:15:52.979 --> 01:15:54.879
Have you seen Fred?

01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:57.081
Maybe try out on the porch.

01:15:57.083 --> 01:15:59.884
It's the handkerchief dance.

01:16:26.812 --> 01:16:30.514
"Paula was long past
their sophomoric treacle,

01:16:30.516 --> 01:16:34.818
writhing nest of hairpin
stockings and formal gowns.

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:38.122
The names they called her
penetrated intact

01:16:38.124 --> 01:16:39.823
through her closed door...

01:16:39.825 --> 01:16:43.160
creepy, loner, disturbed.

01:16:43.162 --> 01:16:44.895
It didn't concern her

01:16:44.897 --> 01:16:49.600
because when she first came
to the school, the bad...

01:16:49.602 --> 01:16:52.036
the bad thing happened.

01:16:52.038 --> 01:16:54.204
She was so frightened, and she
didn't have any friends

01:16:54.206 --> 01:16:58.842
and she never supposed
she would want...

01:16:58.844 --> 01:17:01.545
She never supposed
she would need anyone.

01:17:01.547 --> 01:17:05.215
But now that she had found...

01:17:05.217 --> 01:17:07.651
that she had found a friend...

01:17:07.653 --> 01:17:10.056
she felt the old fear
leaching back."

01:17:31.077 --> 01:17:33.744
What... What are you doing?!

01:17:33.746 --> 01:17:36.313
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

01:17:36.315 --> 01:17:38.849
What?

01:17:38.851 --> 01:17:41.251
No, no, no! No.

01:17:41.253 --> 01:17:42.853
Don't rub. Dab.

01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:59.105
You'd bore him to death
in a week.

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.907
I would comfort him.

01:18:03.909 --> 01:18:07.911
Well, he is an expert

01:18:07.913 --> 01:18:12.616
at finding a willing pair
of legs to open wide.

01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:14.918
You'd die without him, he says.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.920
That's the only reason he stays.

01:18:48.921 --> 01:18:50.723
Shirley?

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:55.059
Shirley?

01:18:55.061 --> 01:18:57.263
What happened?
Are you all right?

01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:02.800
Take me home.

01:19:56.889 --> 01:19:59.156
Who do you see?

01:19:59.158 --> 01:20:01.859
Who do you see?

01:20:01.861 --> 01:20:04.194
You see tired mama.

01:20:04.196 --> 01:20:06.196
Huh?

01:20:14.206 --> 01:20:16.140
I know.

01:20:26.819 --> 01:20:28.719
I know.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:46.303
You're never here!

01:20:46.305 --> 01:20:49.376
Rosie. Rose.
Stop. Please.

01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:16.869
Stanley!

01:21:19.339 --> 01:21:21.106
You rang, madam?

01:21:23.809 --> 01:21:25.075
Uh!

01:21:33.085 --> 01:21:36.153
- Out.
- We're drinking Scotch

01:21:36.155 --> 01:21:38.956
because you worked
straight through dinner, dear,

01:21:38.958 --> 01:21:43.961
as is your habit, apparently,
these many, many weeks.

01:21:43.963 --> 01:21:46.997
And I'm here to say,
I'm sick of it.

01:21:46.999 --> 01:21:48.466
I hate sitting
at the table alone.

01:21:48.468 --> 01:21:50.801
It makes me feel like a widower.

01:21:50.803 --> 01:21:53.471
Or worse,
a decrepit feudal lord.

01:21:53.473 --> 01:21:58.476
You know, you've left me
in a... a vexing position.

01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:01.446
And the children in bed
by 9:00 with their little one.

01:22:01.448 --> 01:22:04.047
Take pity.

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:06.984
Hmm.

01:22:06.986 --> 01:22:08.486
Won't you let me read it,
darling?

01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:11.154
No.

01:22:11.156 --> 01:22:12.359
It's nothing yet.

01:22:18.097 --> 01:22:22.099
The thing is, Stanley,
I don't know if it ever will be.

01:22:22.101 --> 01:22:24.067
I have no idea of an ending.

01:22:24.069 --> 01:22:26.837
Well, all the more reason
for me to...

01:22:26.839 --> 01:22:28.905
have a peek.

01:22:28.907 --> 01:22:31.275
Has the little wifey read it?

01:22:31.277 --> 01:22:33.143
Yes, of course.

01:22:33.145 --> 01:22:37.147
She's a regular William Shawn.

01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:39.983
She comes in here,
and we sit by the fire,

01:22:39.985 --> 01:22:42.553
and she gives me line edits.

01:22:42.555 --> 01:22:45.188
And then she scurries back
into the kitchen

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:46.892
to make me supper.

01:22:50.497 --> 01:22:52.162
Stanley, don't be mad at me.

01:22:52.164 --> 01:22:53.564
No.

01:22:53.566 --> 01:22:57.368
It's the genre, darling,
that's stymying you.

01:22:57.370 --> 01:23:00.571
It's not your arena.

01:23:00.573 --> 01:23:02.509
And frankly, it's beneath you.

01:23:07.514 --> 01:23:10.881
- Keep your theories to yourself.
- Well, you didn't know her.

01:23:10.883 --> 01:23:13.183
Don't tell me that I do
not know this girl.

01:23:13.185 --> 01:23:17.054
Look, I might have walked
by her a dozen times on campus.

01:23:17.056 --> 01:23:18.989
There's nothing fascinating
about this girl,

01:23:18.991 --> 01:23:20.991
except that she's gone.

01:23:20.993 --> 01:23:22.327
What has she done?

01:23:22.329 --> 01:23:24.094
You don't know your subject.

01:23:24.096 --> 01:23:27.197
She's a nothing.
Who is she to you?

01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:31.201
There are dozens and dozens
of girls like this

01:23:31.203 --> 01:23:34.104
littering campuses
across the country.

01:23:34.106 --> 01:23:38.643
Lonely girls who cannot
make the world see them.

01:23:38.645 --> 01:23:41.244
Do not tell me I do
not know this girl.

01:23:41.246 --> 01:23:42.948
Don't you dare!

01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:47.284
Oh.

01:23:47.286 --> 01:23:49.288
So you think
it might be that good.

01:23:58.598 --> 01:24:00.997
- Oh, you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:03.268
Get out!
Out!

01:24:17.484 --> 01:24:21.320
Might it be time then to send
the little children away?

01:24:33.733 --> 01:24:35.966
Oh, I didn't know you
came home last night.

01:24:35.968 --> 01:24:37.335
Oh, I didn't want to wake you.

01:24:37.337 --> 01:24:40.170
I slept on the sofa
in Stanley's study.

01:24:40.172 --> 01:24:41.907
We had a nightcap.

01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:46.209
Mm. Is there coffee?

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.415
You smell like a gin bath.

01:24:51.551 --> 01:24:54.585
Oh, I ran out of eggs, so...

01:24:54.587 --> 01:24:57.020
By the way,
Stanley found us a place.

01:24:57.022 --> 01:24:58.223
What?

01:25:00.693 --> 01:25:02.360
We get to move out in a week.

01:25:51.176 --> 01:25:53.377
Stanley's kicking us out.

01:26:09.529 --> 01:26:13.664
Don't we have anything sweet
around here to eat?

01:26:23.676 --> 01:26:26.711
Okay.

01:26:26.713 --> 01:26:30.146
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:27:09.455 --> 01:27:11.156
Shirley?

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.159
Shirley?

01:27:30.242 --> 01:27:31.475
Shh.

01:27:43.221 --> 01:27:45.322
Can you get me that book?

01:27:45.324 --> 01:27:47.257
Um...

01:27:47.259 --> 01:27:49.560
The blue one on top.

01:27:49.562 --> 01:27:52.930
- This one?
- Yes.

01:27:52.932 --> 01:27:54.632
Thank you.

01:28:03.676 --> 01:28:07.645
This is, um,
Stanley's syllabus,

01:28:07.647 --> 01:28:11.515
and, uh...

01:28:11.517 --> 01:28:14.821
the last name on the list
before mine is Paula's...

01:28:16.889 --> 01:28:22.860
...which means that she was
taking his class maybe

01:28:22.862 --> 01:28:25.230
at the time
that she disappeared.

01:29:09.342 --> 01:29:11.611
I know who my husband
is screwing.

01:29:15.882 --> 01:29:17.617
Do you know who yours has?

01:29:20.887 --> 01:29:22.622
Fred hasn't.

01:29:24.757 --> 01:29:29.595
See, there's no such thing
as the Shakespeare Society.

01:29:34.934 --> 01:29:40.303
It's just how the girls pick...

01:29:40.305 --> 01:29:43.208
which professors
that they're going to fuck.

01:29:47.413 --> 01:29:48.915
Shirley.

01:29:55.655 --> 01:29:58.622
Shirley!

01:29:58.624 --> 01:29:59.824
Open the door!

01:30:04.697 --> 01:30:07.934
Shirley, please!

01:30:11.003 --> 01:30:13.904
You knew this whole time?!

01:30:13.906 --> 01:30:16.507
Why didn't you tell me
six months ago?

01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:21.712
Shirley!

01:30:21.714 --> 01:30:25.516
Shirley, open the door, please.

01:30:29.522 --> 01:30:31.958

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.726
I don't want to go home.

01:32:15.728 --> 01:32:18.831
Where do you want to go, dear?
I'll take you wherever you want.

01:32:25.571 --> 01:32:27.473
I want to go to the trailhead.

01:32:31.444 --> 01:32:32.778
Alright.

01:32:35.047 --> 01:32:36.780
You've seen it.
Let's go.

01:32:41.487 --> 01:32:44.521
Will you hold her
for just a second?

01:32:44.523 --> 01:32:46.757
Rose!

01:32:46.759 --> 01:32:47.958
Come.

01:32:49.795 --> 01:32:52.763
Okay.
Come here, baby.

01:32:52.765 --> 01:32:54.198
Rose, come back!

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.072

Step away, Rose.

01:34:29.128 --> 01:34:30.930
Step away!

01:34:33.099 --> 01:34:34.665
You were right.

01:34:34.667 --> 01:34:37.634
It doesn't take any energy
at all.

01:34:37.636 --> 01:34:39.138
It's just a hop.

01:34:43.275 --> 01:34:47.211
Just slide the right
foot forward,

01:34:47.213 --> 01:34:49.313
and it could all be over.

01:35:32.191 --> 01:35:35.192
You'll feel better again
in no time.

01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:36.894
I feel fine now.

01:35:36.896 --> 01:35:38.898
You know what I mean.

01:35:40.333 --> 01:35:45.738
A little rest,
a little time away...

01:35:47.673 --> 01:35:50.774
...everything will be back
to normal.

01:35:50.776 --> 01:35:53.877
No, no, no, no, no.

01:35:53.879 --> 01:35:56.215

01:36:03.722 --> 01:36:05.224
Little Rosie.

01:36:09.329 --> 01:36:11.895
That was madness.

01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:38.203
Your book
is brilliant, darling.

01:39:45.545 --> 01:39:47.380
Fucking gorgeous.

01:39:51.216 --> 01:39:52.951
I don't know how you did it.

01:39:59.459 --> 01:40:01.528
I have a few notes, of course.

01:40:05.164 --> 01:40:06.865
Of course.

01:40:09.301 --> 01:40:11.170
This is going to be the one.

01:40:14.206 --> 01:40:15.908

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:21.280
It hurts.

01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:32.525

01:40:37.497 --> 01:40:41.164
