00:40.106 --> 00:41.940
Water my houseplants
and feed the dog.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.642
Make sure those utilities
get paid.

00:43.643 --> 00:46.144
Just relax, will you, Kelly?

00:46.145 --> 00:48.013
You're beginning to sound
like my mother.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.848
Just worry
about getting on the boat.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.018
Hey, what's this guy like,
anyway?

00:53.018 --> 00:55.220
I don't know. Sounded kind
of cute on the phone, though.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.188
Uh-huh.

00:57.189 --> 00:59.757
Well, any man that's gonna take
his two kids around the world

00:59.758 --> 01:00.959
can't be all that bad.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.627
He's in for a big surprise.

01:02.628 --> 01:04.763
I know. I'm not gonna stick
around to see what happens.

01:04.763 --> 01:05.764
I wish you were going with me.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.765
I do too.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.735
Think of the ports
you're gonna go to.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.736
I know.

01:14.206 --> 01:16.675
Thanks a lot.
See you in six weeks.

01:16.676 --> 01:17.942
Have a good time.
- Okay.

01:17.943 --> 01:22.380
Don't forget to write me!

01:22.381 --> 01:24.815
You've done most of the work
on the boat yourself

01:24.816 --> 01:26.118
in preparation for this trip.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.285
How long did all that take?

01:27.286 --> 01:29.388
It took us three years.
It's a...

01:29.389 --> 01:31.290
She's a converted
North Sea trawler.

01:31.291 --> 01:34.993
She's strong.
It's just a big family project.

01:34.994 --> 01:37.862
And there's been controversy
that you're placing the girls

01:37.863 --> 01:39.731
in a little bit of danger
with a voyage like this.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.100
Any thoughts on that?

01:42.101 --> 01:44.341
Well, I think we've taken
all the necessary precautions.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.071
Um, the girls have been raised
around boats.

01:47.072 --> 01:48.940
I think there's an element
of danger

01:48.941 --> 01:50.408
in just about anything you do
in life.

01:50.409 --> 01:51.976
Even living in the city.

01:51.977 --> 01:53.311
How do you feel
about this adventure?

01:53.312 --> 01:54.946
I think it's the best thing

01:54.947 --> 01:57.081
I've ever done in my whole life.

01:57.082 --> 01:58.717
What do you think
about all this?

01:58.718 --> 02:00.285
I think it's great.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.888
It sounds
like an extraordinary trip.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.655
I wish I could go with you,
but good luck.

02:04.656 --> 02:06.656
Thank you.

02:14.366 --> 02:16.366
All right?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.871
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

02:20.872 --> 02:22.874
Oh, okay. Bye-bye.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.275
Listen to your dad.

02:24.276 --> 02:25.842
I will.
- You have a great trip.

02:25.843 --> 02:26.877
Okay, we'll be fine.

02:26.878 --> 02:27.879
Take care of her.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.114
Bye-bye.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.716
Hey, gramps. Oh.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.282
Hey.
- You take care for now.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.351
We'll be okay.

02:33.352 --> 02:35.888
I know. I know you will.

02:42.261 --> 02:43.728
Um, I'm glad
you haven't left yet.

02:43.729 --> 02:44.895
Is Mr. Maclaine on board?

02:44.896 --> 02:47.264
Yeah. I'm Maclaine.

02:47.265 --> 02:49.601
<i>Well, hi. I'm Kelly Zimmerman
from World Magazine.</i>

02:49.602 --> 02:50.769
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.269
Where's Peterson?

02:52.270 --> 02:54.172
He broke his leg
in a skydiving assignment.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.740
So I'm taking his place.

02:55.741 --> 02:57.508
Oh, no, you're not.

02:57.509 --> 02:59.609
I didn't agree to take anybody
but Peterson.

02:59.610 --> 03:02.079
Would you rather have a guy
with a broken leg

03:02.080 --> 03:03.448
or the best reporter
on the magazine?

03:03.449 --> 03:05.716
I'd rather have a man
that can sail.

03:05.717 --> 03:07.385
And Peterson's a sailor.

03:07.386 --> 03:08.386
What makes you think I'm not?

03:08.387 --> 03:09.588
Are you?

03:09.589 --> 03:11.691
No, but I'm a quick learner.

03:12.691 --> 03:15.592
Courtney, cut the shore power.
I'll be right back.

03:15.593 --> 03:18.430
I'm not taking
any inexperienced woman.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.332
Which is it?
The inexperienced or the woman?

03:20.333 --> 03:21.600
Both.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.368
Why don't you try
telling my editor that?

03:23.369 --> 03:25.336
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

03:25.337 --> 03:27.037
While you're at it,
why don't you tell her

03:27.038 --> 03:28.906
to give me a raise, huh?

03:28.907 --> 03:31.883
You can tell her
it's combat pay!

03:36.883 --> 03:39.951
Hi. Is he always like this?

03:39.952 --> 03:42.931
Only when he hasn't eaten.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.731
We should be leaving
in about an hour.

03:53.732 --> 03:55.735
The winds will be good then.

03:56.735 --> 03:58.836
Here he comes.

03:58.837 --> 04:00.805
Huh, it doesn't look good.

04:00.806 --> 04:02.341
He'll be going.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.044
He can't afford to go without
the money from the magazine.

04:06.044 --> 04:08.113
Okay, there'll be
no smoking on board.

04:08.114 --> 04:10.114
Yes, sir.

04:11.849 --> 04:13.385
Let's get this bucket moving!

04:13.386 --> 04:15.887
Yeah!
- We're leaving, we're leaving!

04:15.888 --> 04:17.887
Going at last! Great!

04:18.024 --> 04:20.024
Get the three lines, Sam.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.751
<i>First day.</i>

06:59.752 --> 07:03.388
<i>Left the coast and sailed west
into the open sea.</i>

07:03.389 --> 07:04.989
<i>The wind is from the south.</i>

07:04.990 --> 07:07.993
<i>Everything's running smoothly.</i>

07:07.994 --> 07:09.626
<i>I'm glad Kelly is onboard.</i>

07:09.627 --> 07:13.330
<i>She's catching on quick
and will make a good sailor.</i>

07:13.331 --> 07:16.266
<i>I just hope
Dad gives her a chance.</i>

07:16.267 --> 07:18.302
<i>It's hard to believe after
all the years of planning</i>

07:18.303 --> 07:20.769
<i>we're finally on our way.</i>

07:51.769 --> 07:53.537
There you are.

07:53.538 --> 07:56.474
I was beginning to think
you'd fallen overboard.

07:56.475 --> 07:59.947
Now, let's see
if we can find Raggedy Ann.

08:02.947 --> 08:04.381
Shh.

08:04.382 --> 08:05.650
Don't tell on me.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.083
Please, don't tell on me.

08:07.084 --> 08:08.419
Please.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.987
What are you doing here?

08:09.988 --> 08:11.321
I'm an orphan.

08:11.322 --> 08:15.293
If they catch me, they're gonna
break my legs again.

08:16.293 --> 08:17.427
They broke your legs?

08:17.428 --> 08:18.496
Yeah.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.931
They tortured us and everything.

08:20.932 --> 08:22.932
You won't tell on me, will you?

08:23.601 --> 08:25.601
My dad's gonna find you anyways.

08:26.004 --> 08:27.003
No, he won't.

08:27.004 --> 08:29.207
Not if you can keep a secret.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.441
What are you gonna do?

08:30.442 --> 08:32.443
Stick with the boat
till it reaches China,

08:32.445 --> 08:35.678
then I'm gonna be a pirate
and get lots of money.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.587
Sam, lunch is ready.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.587
What are you doing down there?

08:46.291 --> 08:48.291
Please?

08:50.562 --> 08:53.130
Just looking for Penelope.

08:53.131 --> 08:55.503
Come on, let's go.

08:57.503 --> 09:00.271
I'm coming.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.272
Thanks.

09:02.374 --> 09:03.675
Can I get you anything?

09:03.676 --> 09:05.408
A book.

09:05.409 --> 09:10.148
Here, take Penelope.
She can keep you company.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.517
See you later.

09:12.518 --> 09:13.651
What's your name?

09:13.652 --> 09:15.085
Jesse.

09:15.086 --> 09:17.086
I'm Sam.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.980
Don't feed the dog at the table.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.981
Dad?
- Hmm?

09:43.982 --> 09:46.683
What do you call someone
who sneaks on a ship?

09:46.684 --> 09:48.385
A stowaway.

09:48.386 --> 09:50.754
There used to be lots of them
in the old days.

09:50.755 --> 09:52.656
What did they used to do
to them?

09:52.657 --> 09:54.697
They would either, um, put them
to work on the ship

09:55.059 --> 09:57.027
or they would,
uh, keelhaul them.

09:57.028 --> 09:59.163
What's that?

09:59.164 --> 10:01.931
So they would take them
and tie their hands and legs

10:01.932 --> 10:04.268
and drag them the length
of the keel underwater.

10:04.269 --> 10:06.638
The sharks got most of them.

10:06.639 --> 10:07.939
Gross.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.940
You wouldn't do a thing
like that, would you, Dad?

10:12.043 --> 10:14.436
It would depend upon
if it was a girl or not, Sam.

10:37.436 --> 10:40.006
Hey!

10:41.006 --> 10:45.943
Help!

10:51.984 --> 10:53.984
Oh, that always gives me
goose pimples.

10:54.019 --> 10:55.353
More coffee?
- No, thanks.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.220
It's your watch,
I'm gonna take a nap.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.156
Don't let the battery run
too long on the autopilot.

10:59.157 --> 11:00.758
We're gonna finish
our coffees first.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.759
Okay.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.064
He's lucky
Travis didn't see that.

11:07.065 --> 11:09.065
Especially,
since it's his plate.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.061
Jesse.

11:37.062 --> 11:39.376
Jesse, it's just me.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.866
Jesse?

12:14.866 --> 12:16.866
Jesse?

12:29.881 --> 12:31.248
What's up?

12:31.249 --> 12:33.868
Nothing.

12:49.868 --> 12:52.272
He fell over.

12:54.272 --> 12:55.505
Dad!

12:55.506 --> 12:57.508
Dad! Jesse fell over!

12:57.509 --> 12:59.109
What is it, Sam?

12:59.110 --> 13:01.378
You've gotta turn back.
He fell over!

13:01.379 --> 13:02.412
Who fell over?

13:02.413 --> 13:04.148
Hey, what's going on?

13:04.149 --> 13:06.149
There was a little boy, Dad.

13:06.150 --> 13:09.119
And he was hiding on the boat
and he's fallen overboard.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.989
What are you talking about, Sam?

13:10.990 --> 13:12.189
Know anything about this?
- No.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.090
This is his toothbrush
and paste.

13:14.091 --> 13:15.191
They were on the deck.

13:15.192 --> 13:16.460
Sam?

13:16.461 --> 13:19.964
I'm not lying, Dad.
Honest, I'm not lying.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.865
When was the last time
you saw him?

13:21.866 --> 13:24.072
Just before lunch.
He was hiding in the fo'c'sle.

13:27.072 --> 13:30.908
Okay, let's jibe.
Get the head sails.

14:03.908 --> 14:06.476
I see something about
two points off the port bow.

14:06.477 --> 14:08.477
Do you see it?

14:14.820 --> 14:16.820
There he is!

14:23.695 --> 14:25.296
Hey!

14:25.297 --> 14:28.936
Help!

14:30.936 --> 14:33.943
Hey!

14:38.943 --> 14:41.178
A little more to the port.

14:41.179 --> 14:43.179
Okay, hold that!

14:45.082 --> 14:47.183
Okay, coming to get you now.

14:47.184 --> 14:49.220
When you see it reaches,
reach up and get my hand.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.354
Now, reach it up. Come on.
There you go.

14:51.355 --> 14:53.291
Okay, got you.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.292
Okay.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.094
Come on. Come on.

14:57.095 --> 14:59.095
Let me give you a hand.

15:00.331 --> 15:02.331
Come on.

15:03.335 --> 15:04.868
Ah.

15:04.869 --> 15:06.875
Are you okay?

15:09.875 --> 15:12.249
Get him below deck.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

15:18.249 --> 15:20.249
Feeling better?

15:23.054 --> 15:25.856
Here we go. Best way
in the world to warm up.

15:25.857 --> 15:28.097
Does anybody else know
you're on this ship?

15:33.097 --> 15:36.301
Sam tells me you're an orphan.
Is that right?

15:36.302 --> 15:37.968
Yeah.

15:37.969 --> 15:39.903
Okay. I've gotta notify
the Coast Guard

15:39.904 --> 15:42.239
that you're aboard.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.916
Do you have any relatives
anywhere?

15:51.916 --> 15:53.916
No.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.998
Not even an aunt or an uncle?

16:05.998 --> 16:09.066
I have a mother.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.534
But she doesn't know I'm here.

16:11.535 --> 16:15.272
I have four brothers

16:15.273 --> 16:18.308
and sisters,
and they all think I'm dead.

16:18.309 --> 16:21.845
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

16:21.846 --> 16:23.781
It's okay. It's okay, Jesse.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.782
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:26.017 --> 16:28.451
Everything's gonna be all right.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.185
Does the world get to hear
about it?

17:02.186 --> 17:03.854
Hmm.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.989
I probably
wouldn't be interested.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.990
Give it a try.

17:09.894 --> 17:12.194
I was just thinking
how lucky that boy was

17:12.195 --> 17:13.631
we found him out here today.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.036
Ah, he sure was.

17:18.036 --> 17:19.036
Why do you do it?

17:19.037 --> 17:20.738
What, the voyage?

17:20.739 --> 17:23.342
Yeah. The risks, everything.

17:24.301 --> 17:25.742
I just couldn't think
of a better way

17:25.742 --> 17:27.176
to get close to my daughters

17:27.178 --> 17:29.313
and show them
who their father is.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.515
Yeah. The bad parts
as well as the good.

17:31.516 --> 17:34.488
Right.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.689
Well, I sure hope
it all works out for you.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.690
It already has.

17:41.026 --> 17:43.026
Most of it, anyway.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.197

17:47.498 --> 17:50.101
They've had an all-points
out on him for days.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.635
That kid's got a lot of spirit.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.048
My kind of kid.

19:59.297 --> 20:01.297

20:02.366 --> 20:04.334
How's he doing?
- He's settling right in.

20:04.335 --> 20:06.335
Watch it.

20:07.137 --> 20:09.209
Okay, Jaws, open up.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.976
He eats like you, Sam.

20:12.977 --> 20:14.977
Hey.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.550
Look at him eat. Gosh.

20:20.551 --> 20:22.252
It's too big for him.

20:22.253 --> 20:24.788
He can eat anything.
- Come on, baby.

20:30.561 --> 20:32.162
How's it going?

20:32.163 --> 20:34.730
Calm as a horse trough.

20:34.731 --> 20:36.267
Okay, I'm gonna go below,

20:36.268 --> 20:38.302
double-check the weather
and get some shut-eye.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.670
Call me if you need anything.

20:39.671 --> 20:41.671
Okay. Sweet dreams.

20:45.176 --> 20:46.876
You're turning
into a pretty good sailor.

20:46.877 --> 20:48.877
There's nothing else to do.

21:32.289 --> 21:35.225
Dad. You'd better come on deck.
The wind is really picking up.

21:35.226 --> 21:37.226
Okay, I'm coming.

21:39.363 --> 21:41.363
Let's go.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.910
Head her up into the wind!

21:51.910 --> 21:53.375
What?

21:53.376 --> 21:55.812
Head her up into the wind!

21:55.813 --> 21:57.280
Courtney, go below!

21:57.281 --> 22:01.085
Get my harnesses
and foul weather gear.

22:01.086 --> 22:03.720
You should have called me
sooner.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.422
Okay,
keep her headed into the wind.

22:05.423 --> 22:06.923
I've gotta drop the sail!

22:06.924 --> 22:08.961
Okay!

22:34.452 --> 22:36.820
What's happening?
- We're getting into a storm.

22:36.821 --> 22:38.821
You'd better stay down here.

22:53.003 --> 22:56.307
Here. Watch the boom.

22:57.307 --> 23:00.075
Go down below and make sure
everything's secure.

23:00.076 --> 23:02.144
Check the bilges
and then come back

23:02.145 --> 23:04.554
and help me with the main, okay?

23:10.554 --> 23:12.554
I got it. Go below
and get yourself warm.

23:13.057 --> 23:14.490
You did a good job!

23:14.491 --> 23:16.393
How about some coffee?

23:16.394 --> 23:18.442
Later.

23:32.442 --> 23:33.509
How's Sam?

23:33.510 --> 23:35.510
She's still asleep.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.248
That kid doesn't have a nerve
in her body.

23:38.249 --> 23:40.519
There you go.
- Thanks.

23:42.519 --> 23:44.519
Oh, thanks.

23:46.356 --> 23:48.592
I hope this doesn't last long.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.430
It could last for days.

23:52.430 --> 23:56.066
Oh, God. Not again.

23:56.067 --> 23:59.378
Take it. Ugh, take it.

24:08.378 --> 24:10.378
Are you all right?

24:59.297 --> 25:02.766
This is a 2200 hour check-in.
Do you copy, over?

25:02.767 --> 25:04.201
Everybody into their life vests.

25:04.202 --> 25:05.402
Courtney, take the helm.
Kelly, get the life raft ready.

25:05.403 --> 25:07.002
What is it?

25:07.003 --> 25:08.770
Get your shoes on.

25:08.771 --> 25:09.940
Jesse, get over here.

25:09.941 --> 25:11.941
Get over here.

25:43.807 --> 25:45.807
Put it out here!

25:48.045 --> 25:50.045
Oh, God.

25:50.949 --> 25:54.116
Let's put it over the side!

25:54.117 --> 25:56.555
Hang on to that rope!

25:57.555 --> 25:59.848
Come on!

26:24.848 --> 26:27.517
Dad! Dad, we're sinking!

26:27.518 --> 26:29.085
Sam!
Come on, come on.

26:29.086 --> 26:30.487
Everybody in the life boat!

26:30.488 --> 26:32.422
Jesse, get in the life raft!

26:32.423 --> 26:34.423
Take hold of Sam's hand!

26:37.161 --> 26:39.529
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is a mayday.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.498
<i>Mayday, mayday.
The yacht Cloudy.</i>

26:41.499 --> 26:43.499
We are sinking, we are sinking.

26:48.205 --> 26:50.172
Longitude 26 degrees.
10 minutes north. Mayday!

26:50.173 --> 26:51.174
Dad!

26:51.175 --> 26:53.175
Mayday, mayday!

26:55.946 --> 26:57.581
Get in the raft! Kelly, hurry!

26:57.582 --> 26:58.781
Move forward!

26:58.782 --> 26:59.816
Come on, move! Go!

26:59.817 --> 27:01.084
We're sinking!

27:01.085 --> 27:03.085
It's okay, sweetheart.

27:07.057 --> 27:09.230
Okay, push off. Push off.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.913
Keep your weight in the center!

28:02.913 --> 28:05.983
Okay, everybody hold on now.

28:06.904 --> 28:08.384
All right,
here comes another one now.

28:08.385 --> 28:10.385
Hold on tight!

28:13.324 --> 28:14.324
Dad!

28:14.325 --> 28:16.325
Sam!

28:17.228 --> 28:18.761
I've got Sam!

28:18.762 --> 28:20.063
Get the boy! Get the boy!

28:20.064 --> 28:21.897
Courtney!

28:21.898 --> 28:23.898
I got him.

28:24.167 --> 28:26.870
Help me!

28:26.871 --> 28:29.972
Come on, let's get on the
beach. The beach is right here.

28:29.973 --> 28:31.973
I got her. I got her.

28:39.115 --> 28:40.784
Are you okay?

28:40.785 --> 28:41.852
Yeah.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.452
Where are the others?

28:43.453 --> 28:45.922
I don't know.

28:45.923 --> 28:49.861
Kelly!

28:50.861 --> 28:52.861
There they are! Hold her!

28:56.567 --> 28:59.335
Hold on to him!

28:59.336 --> 29:01.336
Okay. I got him.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.748
You're all right.
You're all right, come on.

29:10.748 --> 29:12.848
Come on.

29:12.849 --> 29:14.351
I can't get up!

29:14.352 --> 29:16.352
Yes, you can. Come on!
- Come on.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.854
I'm freezing!

29:18.855 --> 29:21.290
Okay. We'll get a fire going.

29:21.291 --> 29:23.026
Where's Mushroom?

29:23.027 --> 29:25.461
Don't worry about him.
- He can swim.

29:25.462 --> 29:27.931
Whatever happened to Pinocchio?

29:27.932 --> 29:29.199
He just flew away.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.066
No!

29:31.067 --> 29:32.870
Get them to lean to the rocks
up here.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.270
Where are we?

29:34.271 --> 29:36.271
Somewhere on the coast
of Alaska.

30:27.191 --> 30:28.258
What is it?

30:28.259 --> 30:29.425
Sea lions.

30:29.426 --> 30:31.426
Lions?

30:34.131 --> 30:35.798
Are they dangerous?

30:35.799 --> 30:37.799
I don't think so.

30:39.135 --> 30:40.937
We'll just give them
a lot of room.

30:40.938 --> 30:42.938
Hey, Mushroom. Come back!

30:44.241 --> 30:47.814
Mushroom, get back here.
- Come on.

30:50.814 --> 30:52.943
Come here.

31:53.943 --> 31:55.943
You see anything?

31:56.247 --> 31:58.247
Nothing.

31:59.016 --> 32:01.483
Not even a house or anything.

32:01.484 --> 32:04.487
We'll find something.

32:04.488 --> 32:07.359
I'll bet we're the first people
who ever set foot here.

32:10.341 --> 32:12.261
Hey, Samantha, what about
that candy bar you had?

32:12.262 --> 32:13.930
I ate it.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.097
Hey, what's that?

32:15.098 --> 32:16.966
Silly Putty.

32:16.967 --> 32:20.269
Hey, that thing work?
- No.

32:20.270 --> 32:21.837
All right, is that everything?

32:21.838 --> 32:23.838
Not even a knife or fork
to eat with.

32:24.007 --> 32:26.275
There's nothing to eat anyway.

32:26.276 --> 32:29.312
Hey, wait a minute,
where did you get that?

32:29.313 --> 32:31.581
I just traded some comic books.

32:31.582 --> 32:33.582
I'm glad you did.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.185
Okay, I want you
to get a fire going.

32:36.186 --> 32:38.121
I'm gonna see
if I can get us some food.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.855
Can I go?
- Okay.

32:40.856 --> 32:41.857
Me too?

32:41.858 --> 32:43.293
No, you stay here.
- Please?

32:43.294 --> 32:46.630
Stick with the women, kid,
you'll have more fun.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.097
Hey, it's working.

32:49.098 --> 32:51.100
<i>Ever dream of
getting away from it all?</i>

32:51.101 --> 32:52.969
<i>Of going to a land
where the air is pure?</i>

32:52.970 --> 32:55.238
I wouldn't mind
a little smog right now.

32:55.239 --> 32:57.774
Save those batteries
for the weather and the news.

32:57.775 --> 33:00.075
Okay, Dad.

33:00.076 --> 33:01.177
Yeah.

33:01.178 --> 33:03.255
All right. Let's go.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.689
You ever do any hunting before?

33:12.690 --> 33:14.190
No.

33:14.191 --> 33:17.326
Okay. We just gotta
stay close together

33:17.327 --> 33:19.162
and be quiet, all right?

33:19.163 --> 33:21.278
Okay.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.078
What are they?

34:09.079 --> 34:10.346
Caribou.

34:10.347 --> 34:11.480
Okay, stay close to me.

34:11.481 --> 34:13.889
Mushroom, stay.

35:46.943 --> 35:50.655
Hey, Travis, over here!

35:58.655 --> 36:00.655
There's one over there.

36:14.271 --> 36:15.471
Okay.

36:15.472 --> 36:17.339
Better wait back there.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.340
Go on.

36:51.240 --> 36:54.177
Come here, Jesse.
Give me a hand.

37:04.021 --> 37:07.027
Okay, just get behind her
and push.

37:11.027 --> 37:14.431
Come on. Get down there.

37:17.233 --> 37:18.935
Come on, Jesse. Push.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.875
Watch out for those horns.

37:57.875 --> 37:58.841
What are they?

37:58.842 --> 38:01.276
Musk ox.

38:01.277 --> 38:03.918
I've only seen them in pictures.

38:07.918 --> 38:10.419
Mean-looking dudes.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.254
Looks like prime rib to me.

38:12.255 --> 38:14.936
Let's go.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.936
Hold the dog.

39:17.686 --> 39:19.686
Mushroom!

40:23.853 --> 40:26.291
Maybe we should try
something smaller.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.865
Yeah.

40:35.865 --> 40:39.968
The hunters are coming!
The hunters are coming!

40:39.969 --> 40:41.337
Did you get anything?

40:41.338 --> 40:43.272
No, just some eggs, sweetheart.
Come here.

40:43.273 --> 40:46.442
Good.
Courtney can make an omelet.

40:46.443 --> 40:48.176
They got some eggs!

40:48.177 --> 40:50.212
Good. How many?

40:50.213 --> 40:52.284
Let's see.

40:54.284 --> 40:55.683
That's it?

40:55.684 --> 40:57.684
Didn't find anything?

40:59.222 --> 41:01.122
We'll get something tomorrow.

41:01.123 --> 41:03.262
But I'm hungry today.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.263
Hey. What's this?

41:07.264 --> 41:09.198
We found it at the beach.

41:09.199 --> 41:12.201
Isn't she cute?
- She's seems friendly enough.

41:12.202 --> 41:15.370
She must have been hurt
in the storm or something.

41:15.371 --> 41:17.973
Shh. Here's the news.

41:17.974 --> 41:20.209
<i>Coast Guard is searching
for a small sailing vessel</i>

41:20.210 --> 41:22.076
<i>missing since Wednesday night</i>

41:22.077 --> 41:24.946
<i>when a storm swept across
the northern Pacific.</i>

41:24.947 --> 41:26.948
<i>The vessel,
owned by a Seattle family...</i>

41:26.949 --> 41:30.118
That's us.
We're gonna be famous.

41:30.119 --> 41:32.555
<i>The search is being conducted
in that area.</i>

41:32.556 --> 41:34.455
<i>In Juneau today,</i>

41:34.456 --> 41:37.993
<i>the governor stated that
energy consumption in the...</i>

41:37.994 --> 41:40.562
Well, at least,
they know we're missing.

41:40.563 --> 41:43.366
They're looking
in the wrong area.

41:43.367 --> 41:46.301
Well, If they don't find us
there, they'll come here.

41:46.302 --> 41:47.303
Right, Dad?

41:47.304 --> 41:49.304
Right.

41:53.976 --> 41:55.977
I just can't stop thinking
about food.

41:55.978 --> 41:58.147
Think of something else.

41:58.148 --> 42:00.917
That's what my mom
always used to tell us.

42:00.918 --> 42:02.317
Like what?

42:02.318 --> 42:05.855
Like boiled rattlesnake bile
mixed with the blood of a toad.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.321
What's bile?

42:07.322 --> 42:09.959
That green stuff
that comes out of their mouths

42:09.960 --> 42:11.828
when you run them over.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.829
Yuck.

42:15.465 --> 42:16.966
Hey, are you okay?

42:16.967 --> 42:19.201
I'm fine.

42:19.202 --> 42:21.437
Think we have any chance
of walking out of here?

42:21.438 --> 42:24.138
Not with the kids.

42:24.139 --> 42:25.540
The best thing to do
you're looking for

42:25.541 --> 42:27.547
is just sit tight
and be prepared.

42:30.547 --> 42:32.547
They'll extend the search area.

43:02.478 --> 43:04.478
Sorry things haven't
worked out better for you.

43:06.215 --> 43:08.286
It hasn't been too bad so far.

43:10.286 --> 43:13.025
Well, I think we're lucky
Peterson broke his leg.

43:15.025 --> 43:16.325
He didn't.

43:16.326 --> 43:18.995
I talked the editor into
letting me come in his place.

43:18.996 --> 43:20.996
You're kidding.

43:22.398 --> 43:24.398
It never pays to be sneaky.

43:26.168 --> 43:28.470
Well, at least
you'll have a good article

43:28.471 --> 43:30.571
for your magazine now.

43:30.572 --> 43:33.542
Yeah, it's already a book.

43:33.543 --> 43:38.548
<i>How Not to Sail Around the
World with Travis Maclaine.</i>

43:39.548 --> 43:42.021
I just hope
it has a happy ending.

43:45.021 --> 43:47.021
It will.

44:08.911 --> 44:10.178
I've got it.

44:10.179 --> 44:12.856
Get out of the water.

44:19.856 --> 44:21.424
Are you okay, honey?

44:21.425 --> 44:24.998
Cover her with this. Here.

44:27.998 --> 44:28.997
Kelly?

44:28.998 --> 44:30.466
Yeah.
- Give me a hand.

44:30.467 --> 44:32.535
Okay, hold on.

44:32.536 --> 44:34.536
Here you go.

44:49.085 --> 44:51.386
How is she doing?
- Not so good.

44:51.387 --> 44:54.890
Okay, just keep her warm.
I'm gonna get some food.

44:54.891 --> 44:56.125
Can I go?

44:56.126 --> 44:57.426
No, you stay here.

44:57.427 --> 45:00.530
When it stops raining,
you go after those berries.

45:03.298 --> 45:05.366
How are you feeling?

45:05.367 --> 45:07.370
I'm just cold.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.372
Okay, I'll be right back,
all right?

45:09.373 --> 45:11.373
Get you some food.

47:38.288 --> 47:42.857
I wish I could be you for a day
and you could be me.

47:42.858 --> 47:45.166
That way, I could catch a fish.

47:50.166 --> 47:53.782
You should do something
about your breath.

48:38.782 --> 48:40.952
Hey, look at that!

48:41.952 --> 48:43.952
Oh, my...
They're going to land.

48:54.130 --> 48:55.497
I wish we had a gun.

48:55.498 --> 48:57.832
Yeah.

48:57.833 --> 48:59.901
Hey,
I know how we can catch one.

48:59.902 --> 49:00.968
How?

49:00.969 --> 49:02.904
I saw it in a movie once.

49:02.905 --> 49:04.905
Come on.

49:31.132 --> 49:33.368
Yah! Get out of here!
Go on! Git!

49:33.369 --> 49:35.803
Hey! Hey! Hey! Git!

49:35.804 --> 49:40.375
Yah! Yah! Ah! Ah!

49:40.376 --> 49:42.109
Yah! Yah!

49:42.110 --> 49:44.449
Get out! Get out!
Get out of here!

49:47.449 --> 49:50.556
Get out! Get out!

49:53.556 --> 49:55.556
Yah!

49:56.458 --> 50:00.095
Get out of here! Yah!

50:00.096 --> 50:04.933
Yah! Yah!

50:04.934 --> 50:08.347
Yah! Get out of here!

51:09.398 --> 51:12.399
Okay.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.035
I got it!

51:14.036 --> 51:16.872
Don't let go.
- Oh, I won't. Oh, dear.

51:16.873 --> 51:18.205
I didn't believe
you could do it.

51:18.206 --> 51:20.396
All right, here, give me a hand.

51:41.396 --> 51:43.601
Dad!

51:45.601 --> 51:49.206
We were worried about you.

51:50.206 --> 51:51.540
Hey, you're looking good.

51:51.541 --> 51:54.174
I feel much better now.

51:54.175 --> 51:56.178
Kelly caught a goose.

51:56.179 --> 51:58.079
A goose?

51:58.179 --> 52:00.381
How did you get it?

52:00.382 --> 52:03.151
He was just flying around,
so I hit it with a rock.

52:03.152 --> 52:05.152
A rock?

52:05.154 --> 52:06.553
She caught it in the lake.

52:06.554 --> 52:07.355
Hey, no fair.

52:07.356 --> 52:08.989
Hey.

52:08.990 --> 52:09.991
Us men gotta stick together.

52:09.992 --> 52:11.959
Come here, you.

52:11.960 --> 52:15.964
I'm so glad everything's
gonna be okay from now on.

52:15.965 --> 52:17.499
So am I, sweetheart.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.267
Hey, Jesse,
you and I can retire.

52:19.268 --> 52:20.935
The women are doing the hunting.

52:20.936 --> 52:23.171
Yeah, and you can do the dishes
tomorrow too.

52:23.172 --> 52:25.172
I wish we had dishes.

52:26.476 --> 52:28.476
Pretty sunset.

52:57.139 --> 52:59.975
<i>No ships or planes in 45 days.</i>

52:59.976 --> 53:02.410
<i>Everyone's beginning
to lose hope.</i>

53:02.411 --> 53:04.946
<i>Dad goes hunting for food
every day,</i>

53:04.947 --> 53:08.183
<i>but the animals are hard
to catch without a gun.</i>

53:08.184 --> 53:09.817
<i>If we ever get out of here,</i>

53:09.818 --> 53:14.223
<i>I'll never eat another
blueberry as long as I live.</i>

53:14.224 --> 53:17.258
<i>Jesse and Kelly are like
part of the family now.</i>

53:17.259 --> 53:19.060
<i>It's hard to imagine</i>

53:19.061 --> 53:22.430
<i>most of our friends and family
back home think we're dead.</i>

53:22.431 --> 53:24.899
<i>It's already very cold.</i>

53:24.900 --> 53:26.900
<i>Last night,
it snowed for the first time</i>

53:27.036 --> 53:30.339
<i>but didn't settle.</i>

53:30.340 --> 53:33.844
<i>Dad's trying to find a way out
over the mountains.</i>

53:34.844 --> 53:36.844
<i>I hope he makes it.</i>

54:30.099 --> 54:32.099
Hey, look at this one.

54:33.001 --> 54:34.602
Let's see.

54:34.603 --> 54:37.138
Yeah, that's good.

54:37.139 --> 54:39.008
Oh, look what I found.
- Ow!

54:39.009 --> 54:40.808
Oh, neato.

54:40.809 --> 54:43.345
That was mine!

54:43.346 --> 54:45.980
All right, don't get so crabby.

54:45.981 --> 54:48.850
Crabby?

54:48.851 --> 54:50.851
Can you get it?

54:53.021 --> 54:56.960
Hey! Anybody hungry?

54:57.960 --> 54:59.828
Come and get it!

54:59.829 --> 55:01.796
All you can eat!

55:01.797 --> 55:03.797
Come on!

56:18.239 --> 56:19.441
What are they doing?

56:19.442 --> 56:21.109
They're fishing.

56:21.110 --> 56:24.913
Catching the salmon that
are going up river to spawn.

56:24.914 --> 56:28.116
Mm. I love salmon.

56:28.117 --> 56:30.352
Well, if the bears
can catch them, so can we.

56:30.353 --> 56:32.886
There's a good place
downriver here.

56:32.887 --> 56:34.989
What about the bears?

56:34.990 --> 56:37.916
We'll give them lots of room
and keep our eyes open.

57:27.943 --> 57:29.943
Oh. On your left.

57:31.880 --> 57:33.880
Daddy!

58:23.030 --> 58:27.271
I got it.
I got it! I got it.

58:44.286 --> 58:46.461
Mushroom!

58:53.461 --> 58:54.462
There it go...

58:54.463 --> 58:56.463
Yeah! Yeah!

59:17.420 --> 59:20.023
Hey, Mushy. Hey, go on.
- Go on, Mushy.

59:21.023 --> 59:23.124
Oh, that's great, kids.
- Good job.

59:23.125 --> 59:25.364
Come on, Jesse,
let's go get some more.

59:29.364 --> 59:30.966
Enough to last us
the whole year.

59:30.967 --> 59:32.967
Hope we don't need them.

59:34.402 --> 59:36.402
I think we ought to have
a celebration!

59:48.951 --> 59:51.919

Hey, If, uh, I go dance
with Kelly,

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:57.685
would you dance with Jesse?

01:00:57.686 --> 01:00:59.686
Okay.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.756
Uh, excuse me, young man, may I?

01:01:02.757 --> 01:01:04.859
Yeah, you may.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.860

They found us!

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.931
Where is it?

01:02:16.932 --> 01:02:18.533
It's coming right on us!

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.534

01:02:21.036 --> 01:02:23.036
Come on. Let's go.

01:02:23.804 --> 01:02:25.006
Dad!

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:28.910
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.512
Hey! Over here!

01:02:37.885 --> 01:02:40.521
Hey! Hey!

01:02:46.661 --> 01:02:49.164
Hey!

01:03:01.909 --> 01:03:05.613
Here! Over here!
- Help!

01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:07.614
Help.

01:03:52.193 --> 01:03:54.261
You think they'll come back?

01:03:54.262 --> 01:03:56.262
Well, they're looking
in the right area.

01:03:58.233 --> 01:03:59.600
You know,
it's pretty chilly out.

01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:01.002
You sure you wanna sleep
out here?

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.504
You bet.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.775
We don't wanna miss them again.

01:04:06.775 --> 01:04:09.209
How are you doing?

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:11.011
I love you, Dad.

01:04:11.012 --> 01:04:13.083
I love you too, sweetheart.

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:17.324
Good night.
- Good night.

01:04:23.324 --> 01:04:26.194
You know, I saw something
reflecting light today.

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.062
It had to be either metal
or glass.

01:04:28.063 --> 01:04:29.196
Where?

01:04:29.197 --> 01:04:31.332
Just north of here.

01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:33.466
About a day's hike.
I'll check it out tomorrow.

01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:35.169
Eskimos, maybe.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.170
Yeah, let's hope so.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.777
When you're not hungry,
this place isn't so bad.

01:04:50.952 --> 01:04:52.952
Do you wanna take a walk?

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:56.590
Sure.
- Come on.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.261
Don't tempt me. Ah!

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.562
Get out of here. Go on.

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:37.335
Oh, fish breath.

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:41.335
You're finally getting
to like Kelly now, huh?

01:05:44.005 --> 01:05:46.005
Yeah, she's all right.

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.645
What?

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:53.487
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.487
Huh?
- Nothing.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.022
Get out of here, you.

01:06:03.023 --> 01:06:06.392
Dad, Dad, look who showed up!

01:06:06.393 --> 01:06:09.897
Hey, we were smoking the salmon
and he just flew in.

01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:11.499
That figures.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.201
You never see him
until we get some food.

01:06:14.202 --> 01:06:15.870
I'm gonna feed him some more.

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.303
Is that okay, Dad?

01:06:17.304 --> 01:06:20.306
Yeah. Just give him some heads,
though, and tails.

01:06:20.307 --> 01:06:22.307
Okay. Come on, Pinocchio.

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:25.012
Boy, are you gonna get fat.

01:06:28.516 --> 01:06:29.517
You ready?

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.518
Yeah, let's go.

01:06:36.257 --> 01:06:39.125
I wrapped you some smoked fish.

01:06:39.126 --> 01:06:40.127
Thanks.

01:06:40.128 --> 01:06:41.930
Be careful out there, huh?

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:44.098
Yeah.

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:45.098
You be all right?

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:47.099
Mm-hm.
- Good.

01:06:49.003 --> 01:06:51.071
That's good.
Where are my binoculars?

01:06:51.072 --> 01:06:52.406
You just gave them to me.

01:06:52.407 --> 01:06:54.107
Oh, hang on to them.

01:06:54.108 --> 01:06:55.944
You'd better watch him, Jesse.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.578
Make sure he doesn't trip over
an iceberg.

01:06:57.579 --> 01:06:59.579
Yeah.

01:07:00.181 --> 01:07:02.149
Icebergs, huh?
- Bye, Dad.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:04.017
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:04.018 --> 01:07:05.018
I'll see you tonight.

01:07:05.019 --> 01:07:07.019
Okay.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.464
She's a good-looking lady.

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.799
She sure is.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.768
That makes her
all the more dangerous.

01:07:21.769 --> 01:07:23.104
Is that right?

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.404
You bet.

01:07:24.405 --> 01:07:27.975
I've seen grown men
cry over them like babies.

01:07:27.976 --> 01:07:30.243
Harley Brown drove his '56 Chevy

01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:31.912
into a moving train.

01:07:31.913 --> 01:07:34.881
And nearly killed himself
just because of a woman.

01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:37.084
That sounds pretty serious.

01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:38.486
That's why I'm telling you.

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:42.323
Before you know it,
they've got control over you.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:44.158
I'd better be careful, huh?

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:45.826
You want the truth?

01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:48.294
You've already had it.

01:07:48.295 --> 01:07:49.363
Oh, yeah?

01:07:49.364 --> 01:07:51.565
You look like King Kong
with Fay Wray.

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:04.011
Do I have to?

01:08:04.012 --> 01:08:06.012
Yes.

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:09.016
There's a crocodile.

01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:13.187
You okay?

01:08:13.188 --> 01:08:14.855
I hate it.

01:08:14.856 --> 01:08:16.488
Oh, believe me, you needed it.

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.026
You sure did.

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.794
Ah, you just shut up.

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:22.868
Okay, kids, stop fighting.

01:08:27.868 --> 01:08:29.504
There's something back there.

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:31.037
I bet it was the same thing

01:08:31.037 --> 01:08:33.037
that was watching us
at the beach.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.844
Well, whatever it is,
it keeps running away.

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:39.345
Let's check it out.

01:08:39.346 --> 01:08:42.913
I sure hope it's nothing big.

01:09:14.314 --> 01:09:15.415
What was it?

01:09:15.416 --> 01:09:17.483
A bird.

01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:20.356
Another two years off my life.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.863
That was no bird.

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.863
Come on.

01:09:46.546 --> 01:09:48.581
It's a cabin.

01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:50.582
Come on.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.868
Hello? Is anybody there?

01:10:06.868 --> 01:10:08.868
There's something in there.

01:10:12.006 --> 01:10:14.006
Is someone there?

01:10:15.676 --> 01:10:17.676
You kids wait here.

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:21.448
Kelly?

01:10:28.155 --> 01:10:29.122
Kelly!

01:10:29.123 --> 01:10:31.192
Kelly! Are you okay?

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:33.059
Yeah. Get back. Stay back.

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:36.567
Mushy. Shh. Mushy.

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:40.703
Anyone there?

01:10:41.703 --> 01:10:45.738
Courtney, take Mushroom.
Come on, now. Hold on to him.

01:10:45.739 --> 01:10:47.709
Okay. It's all right.
Okay, okay.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:50.545
Good boy. Good boy. Good boy.

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:52.578
That's a good boy.

01:10:52.579 --> 01:10:54.579
Good dog.

01:11:01.556 --> 01:11:03.556
Stay there, okay?

01:11:23.511 --> 01:11:25.312
What is it?

01:11:25.313 --> 01:11:27.648
Nothing.

01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:29.649
Just wait here.

01:12:01.349 --> 01:12:03.951
That's it?

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.952
That's it.

01:12:07.622 --> 01:12:10.194
Looks like it's been here
a long time, huh?

01:12:14.194 --> 01:12:16.096
You know something?

01:12:16.097 --> 01:12:17.663
Maybe we should tell the girls

01:12:17.664 --> 01:12:20.568
we saw a couple of guys
on the beach, anyway.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:23.069
Just to give them hope.

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:25.505
And then what?

01:12:25.506 --> 01:12:27.506
Then we'll tell them
they're gonna pick us up

01:12:27.507 --> 01:12:29.945
in a couple of days.

01:12:30.945 --> 01:12:32.013
And when they don't show up?

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:35.181
We'll just tell them
something else.

01:12:35.182 --> 01:12:37.350
If they believed it
the first time,

01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:40.453
they'll believe it again.

01:12:40.454 --> 01:12:43.357
You'd be a good politician,
Jesse.

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.259
I can see it now.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.498
President
Jesse C. Hayes III.

01:12:51.498 --> 01:12:54.335
It's been here four years.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.656
There's more of the plane up
there. Let's go check it out.

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.707
You stay here.

01:13:58.432 --> 01:14:01.967
Jesse!

01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:22.261
Jesse! Jesse! Look!

01:14:27.261 --> 01:14:29.261
Run!

01:14:46.046 --> 01:14:48.046
Run!

01:15:04.431 --> 01:15:06.431
Travis!

01:15:08.168 --> 01:15:10.168
Travis!

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.573
Travis!

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:19.313
Hey!

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:20.647
Get out!

01:15:20.648 --> 01:15:23.349
Hey! Get out!

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.421
Come on, here I am!
Come get me!

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:29.395
Hey! Hey!

01:16:07.395 --> 01:16:09.395
Get out!

01:16:18.472 --> 01:16:20.472
Get out!

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:23.376
Yah!

01:17:40.054 --> 01:17:42.054
Travis?

01:17:54.135 --> 01:17:56.515
It's gonna be all right.

01:18:07.515 --> 01:18:09.517
Yeah. I didn't exactly
tell the kids the truth

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:12.118
about the diary.

01:18:12.119 --> 01:18:14.121
How's that?

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:16.556
I just didn't think
they should hear it.

01:18:16.557 --> 01:18:18.559
I'll read you some of it, okay?

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.993
Yeah.

01:18:19.994 --> 01:18:22.595
"He came again today
from the north.

01:18:22.596 --> 01:18:25.431
I was on the beach
and I was too weak to run.

01:18:25.432 --> 01:18:28.667
I could smell the stench
of his breath as he mauled me.

01:18:28.668 --> 01:18:31.039
The dog taunted him away."

01:18:32.039 --> 01:18:34.179
He's talking about
a giant Kodiak bear.

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.484
Then last entry:

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:47.487
"Wish I had died
with my dear Janey.

01:18:47.488 --> 01:18:50.357
No pain now,
just the cold, the dog

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.564
and the awful loneliness."

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.000
It says if anyone finds this,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.300
tell his mom and dad
that he loved them.

01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:04.471
He was only 23 years old.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.680
If you read it,
you felt like you knew him.

01:19:15.048 --> 01:19:17.718
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:19.719
We're gonna get out of here.

01:19:22.155 --> 01:19:25.459
We can see you.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.063
It's already September.

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:31.065
Hey, the news.
- We're on the news again.

01:19:32.065 --> 01:19:35.169
Come on.

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:37.804
<i>The ketch, owned
by Travis Maclaine of Seattle,</i>

01:19:37.805 --> 01:19:40.139
<i>was lost in the storm
nearly five weeks ago.</i>

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.341
<i>The Coast Guard reports</i>

01:19:41.342 --> 01:19:43.143
<i>there's been no sign of wreckage</i>

01:19:43.144 --> 01:19:45.346
<i>and have officially called off
the search.</i>

01:19:48.815 --> 01:19:52.158
<i>♪ Sitka's KIFW ♪</i>

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:59.158
Okay.
Now, that's the 6:00 bad news.

01:19:59.159 --> 01:20:01.495
Here comes
the 6:00 good news.

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:03.028
We're getting out of here.

01:20:03.029 --> 01:20:04.964
How?

01:20:04.965 --> 01:20:06.399
We're gonna build a boat.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.136
With what?
All you've got is a penknife.

01:20:10.137 --> 01:20:11.804
We could dive on the wreck.

01:20:11.805 --> 01:20:14.374
Now, we saw the tip of the mast
at low tide today.

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:16.510
If I can get to my ax
and my tool box,

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:19.246
we can do it.

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.247
Okay?

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.317
Well, okay?

01:20:25.019 --> 01:20:27.087
Okay.

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.127
Okay.

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:33.227
Okay, honey?

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:35.961
I don't wanna stay here anymore.

01:20:35.962 --> 01:20:39.431
I wanna go home.
- Come here.

01:20:39.432 --> 01:20:41.432
It's always raining
and cold here.

01:20:42.002 --> 01:20:45.304
I wanna go home where it's warm.

01:20:45.305 --> 01:20:46.874
We're going home.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.908
When?

01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:50.909
Soon.

01:21:12.766 --> 01:21:15.469
Okay, there she is.
- Okay.

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.670
Now, you've gotta hold
this position, all right?

01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:19.273
Okay.

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:22.248
How deep is it?
- About 25 or 30 feet.

01:21:27.248 --> 01:21:28.247
What?

01:21:28.248 --> 01:21:30.584
Oh, you're kind of cute.

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.285
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, miss,

01:21:32.286 --> 01:21:33.554
but that's all I'm taking off.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.121
Otherwise
I'm gonna freeze to death.

01:21:35.122 --> 01:21:37.122
Too bad.

01:21:41.395 --> 01:21:42.629
Oh.

01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:44.497
It's cold.

01:21:44.498 --> 01:21:45.532
It's so cold.

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:47.703
Ah.

01:22:22.703 --> 01:22:24.703
You got it.

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:30.746
I got the medicine kit too.

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:33.179
Uh, we're in luck, you know.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.448
There's some air trapped
in the cabin down there.

01:22:35.449 --> 01:22:37.349
Yeah? Great.

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:39.117
Hey, I see you've got a friend.

01:22:39.118 --> 01:22:40.687
Aw, she scared the heck
out of me.

01:22:40.688 --> 01:22:41.688
I thought she was a shark.

01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:43.689
Oh, no.

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.654
Hold that line.
- Okay.

01:23:48.655 --> 01:23:51.425
It's got a sail
and my tool kit attached to it.

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:53.426
Oh, okay.

01:23:54.395 --> 01:23:57.096
Hey, what's with her?

01:23:57.097 --> 01:23:59.097
Maybe her flippers are freezing.

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:13.532
Travis? Oh, Go...

01:26:13.533 --> 01:26:16.235
Travis.

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:21.441
Oh.

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:23.443
Are you all right? Huh?
- Yeah.

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:25.511
Oh, I thought you were dead.

01:26:25.512 --> 01:26:26.912
Don't do it again.

01:26:26.913 --> 01:26:28.281
Okay.
Everything is all right.

01:26:28.282 --> 01:26:30.049
Oh, I'm...
- It's all right.

01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:32.419
The whale came up
and it just stared at me.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.653
It just came up
and just looked at me.

01:26:34.654 --> 01:26:37.491
Now, listen. No. That whale
was after the sea lion, okay?

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:39.792
It wasn't after us. If it was,
it would have got us, okay?

01:26:39.793 --> 01:26:41.898
Okay.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.066
We've got everything we need
to build the boat.

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:48.535
It's gonna be fine.
It will be all right.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.721
Okay.
- All right.

01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:16.389
Hey, batter, batter, batter.

01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:17.991
Hey! Catch!

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.158
You got it?

01:28:19.159 --> 01:28:21.260
Hey, no. No.
- Throw it to me!

01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:23.261
Here!

01:28:26.699 --> 01:28:29.270
Yeah!
- Hey!

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.823
Whoa!

01:28:55.962 --> 01:28:57.063
Ah!

01:28:57.064 --> 01:28:59.064
Hey!

01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:24.884
How many more coats?

01:30:24.885 --> 01:30:27.286
That should be the last one.

01:30:27.287 --> 01:30:29.287
What's my position gonna be
on this boat?

01:30:30.056 --> 01:30:33.060
Ah, you're gonna be in charge
of the engine room.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:37.362
What engine?
- There's no engine.

01:30:37.363 --> 01:30:40.800
Do you think they took our name
off the school list now?

01:30:40.801 --> 01:30:43.234
I don't think
you ever were on it, Sam.

01:30:43.235 --> 01:30:45.475
What's the first thing you're
gonna do when we get back?

01:30:46.038 --> 01:30:47.372
Burn this red sweater.

01:30:47.373 --> 01:30:49.373
And this blue one. Ugh.

01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.778
I'm gonna take a long hot bath.

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.112
And smoke a cigarette?

01:30:53.113 --> 01:30:56.282
Uh-huh
I'm gonna see my mom and dad.

01:30:56.283 --> 01:30:58.885
You girls finish up here.
I'll go get the boys.

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:00.821
I'm gonna have
six chocolate malts.

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:02.354
I'm gonna have
six hot fudge sundaes.

01:31:02.355 --> 01:31:04.756
Let's pig out.

01:31:04.757 --> 01:31:05.758
What is it?

01:31:05.759 --> 01:31:06.959
Get back! Get back! Back!

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.960
What is it?
- Shh.

01:31:10.096 --> 01:31:12.230
Travis! Travis!

01:31:12.231 --> 01:31:14.467
Travis!

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:20.238
Travis!

01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:24.708
Okay. Get back, get back.

01:31:26.313 --> 01:31:27.313
Dad!

01:31:27.314 --> 01:31:29.314
Travis!

01:31:44.297 --> 01:31:46.367
Hey! Hey!

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.376
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:58.377
Come on!

01:31:59.112 --> 01:32:00.679
Oh, run!

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.415
Run! Come on, Sam!

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:04.416
Go ahead! Go!

01:32:09.456 --> 01:32:12.360
Hurry up!
- Go on you guys! Go!

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.264
Come on, Kelly! Come on!

01:32:18.832 --> 01:32:20.867
He's coming!

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.169
Run!

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:26.009
Come on, Travis!

01:32:29.009 --> 01:32:31.009
No!

01:32:36.048 --> 01:32:37.383
Sam, get up! Get up!

01:32:37.384 --> 01:32:39.484
Come on!

01:32:39.485 --> 01:32:41.485
Get up, Sam!

01:32:47.994 --> 01:32:48.995
Sam!

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:51.997
Where's Sam? Oh!

01:32:51.998 --> 01:32:55.000
Sam!

01:34:10.143 --> 01:34:12.347
Sam.

01:34:14.347 --> 01:34:17.953
Sam. Please don't die.

01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:19.986
Oh, Sam.

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.987
Sam.

01:34:22.354 --> 01:34:23.555
Please don't die, Sam.

01:34:23.556 --> 01:34:26.792
Sam! Sam!

01:34:26.793 --> 01:34:28.126
Please, God, don't do it!

01:34:28.127 --> 01:34:31.363
Ah! Sam! Oh!

01:34:31.364 --> 01:34:38.438
Sam!

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:41.806
No!

01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:43.041
Sam.

01:34:43.042 --> 01:34:45.443
No! No! Sam!

01:34:45.444 --> 01:34:46.845
Sam.

01:34:46.846 --> 01:34:51.483
Sam. Sam.

01:34:51.484 --> 01:34:53.117
Sam! Sam!

01:34:53.118 --> 01:34:55.118
Please, don't do it.

01:34:57.489 --> 01:34:59.489
God.

01:35:00.393 --> 01:35:02.393
Come here. Come here.

01:35:03.029 --> 01:35:04.028
All right.

01:35:04.029 --> 01:35:06.029
Sam.

01:35:11.438 --> 01:35:13.272
Sam? Sam?

01:35:13.273 --> 01:35:15.273
Sam.

01:35:15.475 --> 01:35:17.343
Sam.

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:20.446
We just couldn't find her.
- We couldn't find her.

01:35:20.447 --> 01:35:23.181
Dad, please don't let her die.

01:35:23.182 --> 01:35:25.182
Sam.

01:35:26.319 --> 01:35:29.287
Sam.

01:35:29.288 --> 01:35:30.488
Sam?

01:35:30.489 --> 01:35:32.157
Sam, please.

01:35:32.158 --> 01:35:33.125
Sam.

01:35:33.126 --> 01:35:35.126
Sam?

01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:39.203
Come on, Sam. Come on, Sam.

01:35:43.203 --> 01:35:45.203
There.

01:35:45.204 --> 01:35:47.204
Spit it out.

01:35:49.208 --> 01:35:50.209
Easy now.

01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:52.210
Dad?

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:56.016
It's okay. You're okay.

01:35:57.016 --> 01:35:59.016
Breathe now.

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.889
Courtney kept saying I was dead

01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:06.890
and I couldn't tell her
I wasn't.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:09.127
Sam.
- It's okay.

01:36:09.128 --> 01:36:10.828
You're gonna be all right now.

01:36:10.829 --> 01:36:13.237
Come on.
Let's get you some fire.

01:36:17.237 --> 01:36:20.109
Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry.

01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:27.145
I got the bear
with the flare gun.

01:36:27.146 --> 01:36:30.854
Good for you, Jesse.
Good for you.

01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:35.487
Okay,
everybody stay near the fire.

01:36:35.488 --> 01:36:37.488
I'm gonna get
some more blankets.

01:36:42.295 --> 01:36:43.962
Oh, my God!

01:36:43.963 --> 01:36:45.197
Okay, let's get into the boat.

01:36:45.198 --> 01:36:46.832
Dad, don't let him this way!

01:36:46.833 --> 01:36:48.833
Run! Come on!

01:36:49.002 --> 01:36:51.172
Go! Come on, come on!
- Come on! Go, come on!

01:36:53.172 --> 01:36:55.008
Dad!

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:58.410
Come on! Jesse, get up there!
Come on, push!

01:36:58.411 --> 01:37:00.211
Dad!

01:37:00.212 --> 01:37:02.415
Heave! Come on! Move it!

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:05.787
Kelly, get up there. Come on!
- Push!

01:37:08.787 --> 01:37:10.787
Come on, push!

01:37:18.297 --> 01:37:20.297
Come on!

01:37:23.235 --> 01:37:24.969
Get the dog! Dad!

01:37:24.970 --> 01:37:27.275
Come here! Come here!
Come here!

01:37:29.275 --> 01:37:33.078
Come here!
- Dad, don't leave him behind!

01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:38.496
Go! Get in the boat!
Get in the boat!

01:39:07.806 --> 01:39:09.806
Hey!

01:39:16.916 --> 01:39:19.285
Hey!

01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:21.019
Here!

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.020
They've seen us!

01:39:23.523 --> 01:39:25.891
It's about time somebody did!

01:39:27.359 --> 01:39:29.362
Will you marry me?

01:39:29.363 --> 01:39:30.830
What?

01:39:30.831 --> 01:39:33.898
I said will you marry me?

01:39:33.899 --> 01:39:35.267
Look, it's a big decision.

01:39:35.268 --> 01:39:37.170
You don't have to give me
an answer right away.

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:39.071
I mean, take your time.
Just keep it on you...

01:39:39.072 --> 01:39:41.072
You're crazy. Yes!

01:39:42.774 --> 01:39:44.774
They're getting married.
