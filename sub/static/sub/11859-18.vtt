WEBVTT

00:25.458 --> 00:27.125
No sign of target.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.875
(male #1 on phone)
'You've got to hide, Pete.'

00:33.959 --> 00:36.625
'They'll find you,
and you'll burn.'

00:36.709 --> 00:38.875
'Don't let them have the map.'

00:43.917 --> 00:46.208
Exley?

00:46.291 --> 00:48.125
What are you doing here?

00:48.208 --> 00:49.417
Do you have the map?

00:52.750 --> 00:55.291
You trust me.

00:55.375 --> 00:56.709
Right, Pete?

01:11.458 --> 01:13.834
You're safe now, Pete.

01:13.917 --> 01:18.000
I want you to hear something.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.166
I-I don't understand.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.875
Close your eyes.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.834
Remember what I told you.

01:34.917 --> 01:36.166
Focus on one instrument.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.917
Do you still hear
Exley's voice?

01:57.583 --> 01:58.834
He's gone.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.542
Good.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.166
You're doing good, Pete.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.417
The inner plane
hierarchy
must be in flux.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.291
I think...I
think
that's why he
left.

02:09.375 --> 02:12.709
Well, maybe he's not
a John Lennon fan like us.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.166
Can you play the Wheel song?

02:14.250 --> 02:17.208
Sure. That's your favorite.

02:17.291 --> 02:19.583
Dr. Ramierez..

02:19.667 --> 02:21.583
...I don't understand..

02:21.667 --> 02:24.291
...why they want me to burn.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.166
I didn't do anything.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.917
I know you didn't, Pete. I know.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.291
- "Sea-monkeys?"
- Yeah.

03:13.375 --> 03:14.709
Nice to see
you
went all out.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.750
They're educational
and entertaining.

03:16.834 --> 03:17.834
Any word on Will?

03:17.917 --> 03:20.041
Out of the hospital tomorrow.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.959
How about we sign our names
to one and keep the other?

03:32.041 --> 03:35.625
What he doesn't
know...can't
hurt him.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.667
Help you?

03:42.750 --> 03:44.208
I'm looking for the detectives

03:44.291 --> 03:45.458
that work on old cases.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.458
You got one.
I'm Detective Rush.

03:47.542 --> 03:51.375
Steve Wiegan. It's about my
college roommate, Pete Scanell.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.083
Brilliant guy
with big
dreams.

03:57.542 --> 04:01.041
(Steve)
'This was for Travis.'

04:01.125 --> 04:04.458
- 'It's really good.'
- Thanks, man.

04:04.542 --> 04:07.291
Pete was gonna be
a mechanical engineer

04:07.375 --> 04:10.333
until he started saying
the TV was talking to
him.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.834
- He was murdered?
- No.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.333
I mean, I don't know for sure

04:13.417 --> 04:16.667
but I think he may
have
killed someone.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.750
Disappeared at the end
of our freshman year.

04:18.834 --> 04:22.458
Thought he went back
to Oregon until yesterday.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.291
I volunteer at
a shelter downtown.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.959
There was this homeless guy
sitting out front

04:27.041 --> 04:29.417
scribbling into
a notebook, mumbling.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.667
Pete?

04:30.750 --> 04:31.917
Couldn't believe it.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.583
I said his name,
and he started freaking out.

04:34.667 --> 04:38.667
He took off,
but he dropped this.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.917
Check out the page I marked.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.208
"Dr. Ramierez had to burn.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.834
It started with the
curtains,
they lit up like paper."

04:46.917 --> 04:48.667
I Googled the name.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.917
There was a Dr. Julie Ramierez

04:51.000 --> 04:52.875
therapist specializing
in schizophrenia.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.291
Killed five years ago
when her house burned down.

04:55.375 --> 04:57.291
Yeah, part of
a string of
arsons.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.709
- A man was convicted.
- I saw that.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.959
But Pete's description, I mean--

05:01.041 --> 05:03.875
- You think he did it.
- I don't know.

05:03.959 --> 05:07.041
But if he did, he's
still out there, detective.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.083
(Vera)
'Richard Kiesel.'

05:45.166 --> 05:48.250
Consecutive lifes for
starting two fatal fires.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.709
Remind me not to invite you
to a barbecue.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.208
The houses were
supposed to be empty.

05:53.291 --> 05:56.333
Prosecuted on five counts
of arson, convicted on two.

05:56.417 --> 05:58.875
It was never
my intention to harm.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.083
Part of your plea was they
drop the Ramierez charge.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.917
'Cause that wasn't mine.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.083
I picked buildings
I could watch burn.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.208
That house had no vantage point.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.041
How is the vantage point
in here?

06:12.375 --> 06:14.458
Is that, uh...

06:16.000 --> 06:17.375
May I?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.750
Gas was my accelerant.

06:26.834 --> 06:29.500
If it was me,
you'd see a black char

06:29.583 --> 06:32.083
across the floor
like a skid mark.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.542
Maybe you felt like
switching it up.

06:33.625 --> 06:35.500
[scoffs]
No.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.667
This is amateur hour.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.709
See the charring
around the windows?

06:40.792 --> 06:41.709
Point of origin?

06:41.792 --> 06:43.291
Ten to one, this thing started

06:43.375 --> 06:46.125
with the curtains.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.625
And prior to discharging
your weapon three times

06:49.709 --> 06:52.500
at a 12-year-old boy,
is it true you were
required

06:52.583 --> 06:54.917
to attend counseling
for another shooting?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.291
I don't see how that's relevant.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.667
- Yes or no, detective.
- Yes.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.458
And did you fulfill
your obligation

07:00.542 --> 07:02.417
as required by
the discipline code?

07:02.500 --> 07:03.917
Yes, I did.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.667
You went to every session?

07:05.750 --> 07:08.667
- The doctor signed the
release.
- I'll take that as a no.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.250
And when you shot
little Gabriel Ariza

07:11.333 --> 07:14.333
did you say, "I don't need
an excuse to take you down?"

07:14.417 --> 07:15.333
He was shooting at us--

07:15.417 --> 07:16.750
Is that what you said before

07:16.834 --> 07:19.166
you shot and killed
George Marks?

07:21.125 --> 07:22.959
How about an
objection,
counselor?

07:23.041 --> 07:24.375
That scumbag was
way out of line.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.542
Sorry, excuse me a minute.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.208
Well, that was a hell of a
show
you put on back there, Rosie.

07:29.291 --> 07:32.542
Funny how you brought up
the, uh...discipline
code.

07:32.625 --> 07:33.500
Funny?

07:33.583 --> 07:34.750
Well, you get pinched on a DUI

07:34.834 --> 07:37.166
last year, call me
to make it go away

07:37.250 --> 07:39.041
and this is how you
treat
one of my detectives?

07:39.125 --> 07:40.208
Well, that was personal.

07:40.291 --> 07:41.875
I'm providing a defense
for my client.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.750
The kid shot a cop.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.709
Don't get much more
personal than that to
me.

07:45.792 --> 07:46.709
Relax, Curtis.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.333
Let the judge
kick this back down

07:48.417 --> 07:51.000
try Ariza as a juvie, and
I'll give up appellate rights.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.792
Let me
think.
Mm...no.

07:53.875 --> 07:55.208
Get real.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.542
I got a kid with
a low IQ and no priors.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.417
You've got a shady statement
coerced by a quick-shot cop.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.083
She's been a cop
for over 15 years

08:02.166 --> 08:04.000
of course she's been
involved in a
shooting.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.125
Hell of a shot, too.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.875
She's also got a temper
on the stand.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.542
And after I subpoena
her internal affairs files

08:09.625 --> 08:11.625
we both know that that
confession's getting thrown
out.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.875
Okay, you want to
roll
the dice, let's go.

08:13.959 --> 08:16.250
First degree Felony
murder,
that's, uh..

08:16.333 --> 08:19.166
Wow,
that's-that's
mandatory life.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.250
- See you in court.
- Come on, Curtis.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.458
Kid will die in prison.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.625
Okay, so he pleads
to third degree.

08:25.709 --> 08:27.458
Twenty-five to
fifty
for shooting
Jeffries.

08:27.542 --> 08:28.792
Still gonna give him
a chance to get out

08:28.875 --> 08:30.291
before they carry
him out in a box.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.291
That, and you apologize
to the good detective.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.750
Like you mean it.

08:37.709 --> 08:40.291
Apologies, detective.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.375
Nice doing
business
with you, Rosie.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.709
Thank me later.
Buy me lunch.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.125
- Hey, how was court?
- Laugh a minute.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.750
Any luck finding Pete Scanell?

09:00.834 --> 09:02.625
Yeah, got uniforms
checking the
shelters

09:02.709 --> 09:03.834
and a stakeout
at the soup
kitchen

09:03.917 --> 09:05.125
'where the roommate works.'

09:05.208 --> 09:06.542
Dr. Julie Ramierez.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.959
PHD from Temple.
Grew up poor in El Centro.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.250
Both parents now deceased.
No siblings.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.917
Well, she worked
the tranquility
house

09:13.000 --> 09:15.208
a board and care
for the mentally
ill.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.458
You try and get a copy of her
patient records on Pete
Scanell?

09:17.542 --> 09:18.792
Was an uphill battle, boss.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.792
Patient
confidentially
laws are a bitch.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.709
Case closed.
The Traydens did
it.

09:22.792 --> 09:25.959
"The Traydens poisoned
the air, made electric
wind.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.959
I took a flame-ship that
blasted
me into the inner plane."

09:29.041 --> 09:31.083
Here's a map
if anybody cares to
visit.

09:31.166 --> 09:34.166
Check it out, see if any of the
details match the crime scene.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.917
Boss, this guy's cuckoo pants.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.625
Agents from the inner
plane
want to kill him.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.083
I'll do it.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.291
Screen grab
from his Myspace page

09:41.375 --> 09:43.917
hasn't been updated
since he dropped out of
college.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.667
Lot of friends
and hobbies.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.583
And bong relay
was his favorite sport.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.583
- Family?
- His father in Oregon.

09:50.667 --> 09:51.875
'Wasn't too chatty.'

09:51.959 --> 09:53.834
Got the feeling
they hadn't spoken in years.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.458
Well, check credit cards,
phone records.

09:55.542 --> 09:58.792
See if Dr. Ramierez had problems
with anyone, Pete or otherwise.

10:04.250 --> 10:07.500
Everyone here
at tranquility felt her loss.

10:07.583 --> 10:10.375
Julie went the extra mile
for her patients.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.208
She having trouble
with any of them?

10:12.291 --> 10:14.834
Kind of goes with the territory,
but nothing out of the ordinary.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.458
Remember a patient
of hers, Pete Scanell?

10:17.542 --> 10:20.000
You know I can't discuss that.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.125
A patient's confidentiality
is sacrosanct.

10:22.208 --> 10:23.667
If you could just
tell us
if he was staying
here

10:23.750 --> 10:24.875
the night Julie died.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.709
I'm sorry. Unless you have
a court order..

10:27.792 --> 10:30.417
Do you have a lockdown time
here for patients like Pete?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.333
Oh, each patient is treated
individually.

10:32.417 --> 10:35.959
Some are on lockdown,
some are free to come and go.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.333
The kid's a murder suspect.

10:37.417 --> 10:40.375
We know he was here,
we clear him of being a
suspect.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.583
Again, unless you have
a court order--

10:42.667 --> 10:45.709
Your employee was murdered.
And we're asking for your
help.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.583
Is there anything
you can tell us
about

10:47.667 --> 10:50.875
when he wasn't
legally a patient here
yet?

10:50.959 --> 10:52.375
Were you at his intake?

10:52.458 --> 10:55.125
Look, I'm breaking the rules.

10:55.208 --> 10:56.375
I can tell you this much..

11:01.500 --> 11:02.542
What day is it, Pete?

11:02.625 --> 11:03.792
If I said it was Monday

11:03.875 --> 11:05.834
you'd tell Exley
I said it's Tuesday.

11:05.917 --> 11:10.417
'I know the FBI has this room
wired. I'm not a fool.'

11:10.500 --> 11:11.917
Think about
hurting
yourself, Pete?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.208
I hurt, and I think,
and I watch, and I think.

11:14.291 --> 11:17.166
Just watching
the wheels go round.

11:17.250 --> 11:21.667
I love to watch them roll..

11:25.917 --> 11:29.792
Pete. Who's your
favorite Beatle?

11:29.875 --> 11:32.375
My favorite Beatle is John.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.375
They'd talk and she'd have
Pete
listen to John Lennon music.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.709
Julie thought music
was a genuine therapy.

11:44.792 --> 11:45.709
It's not?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.917
Music works well
with brain trauma

11:48.000 --> 11:50.709
but studies are inconclusive
with schizophrenia.

11:50.792 --> 11:52.291
Honestly, I thought
it was a waste of time.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.625
Was she like that
with all her
patients?

11:53.709 --> 11:55.667
She had a unique perspective.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.458
Her mom was
an undiagnosed schizophrenic.

11:58.542 --> 11:59.792
Suicide when Julie was 16.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.542
I think when she was
with a patient

12:03.625 --> 12:06.458
she was trying
to understand her mother.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.750
You noticed anything
going
on the day she died?

12:09.834 --> 12:11.834
Just that she didn't
show up for work.

12:11.917 --> 12:14.583
I left a few messages for her,
but I never heard back.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.583
Who was this
caseworker,
the guy with tats?

12:17.667 --> 12:19.166
Juan Salazar. Good guy.

12:19.250 --> 12:23.500
He left a couple of years ago
to work with recovering
addicts.

12:23.583 --> 12:26.959
Well, thanks for all
the info on Pete
Scanell.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.291
Big help.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.625
You know,
contrary to popular myth

12:29.709 --> 12:32.125
most paranoid
schizophrenics are timid.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.041
Pete fit that profile.

12:34.125 --> 12:37.750
He was a good kid
who was severely ill.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.250
An illness
that makes you violent.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.125
I'd rather be trapped with
a paranoid schizophrenic

12:41.208 --> 12:44.709
than a bipolar or a
borderline personality
disorder.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.166
You never met the homeless guy
that attacked me with a
hacksaw.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.667
Said Mr. Spock
made him do it.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.250
Most voices are harmless,
especially at the onset.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.709
It's usually a friend
or a family member.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.834
[sighs]
I struck out with the judge.

12:57.917 --> 13:00.834
No access to Julies' patient
records on Pete Scanell.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.834
I'll talk to Bell.
Maybe he can call in a
favor.

13:02.917 --> 13:06.333
Got a possible sighting
of Pete at Kemble Park.

13:06.417 --> 13:07.875
'Took off when he
saw the uniform.'

13:07.959 --> 13:10.083
Police can't look too
friendly to a paranoid
kid.

13:10.166 --> 13:14.709
I'll swing by with Valens.
Maybe he'll come back around.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.500
Vanessa Quarterman
came forward at the fire
scene.

13:17.583 --> 13:20.750
Said she had dinner with
the victim the night
before.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.458
See what she knows.

13:22.542 --> 13:27.291
Julie and I
were kappa sisters, real
close.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.250
I named my daughter after her.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.250
Still can't believe it.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.917
Was she acting
different in any
way..

13:34.000 --> 13:35.625
...upset with anyone?

13:35.709 --> 13:37.208
No, we had a great time.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.458
And she seemed busy, but happy.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.667
(Vera)
'You two worked together?'

13:41.750 --> 13:42.583
God, no.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.166
I got into investment banking

13:44.250 --> 13:47.041
for the money, and she
was always a do-gooder.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.208
Not quite a pair.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.709
Was there a boyfriend
in the picture?

13:49.792 --> 13:53.208
I tried to set her up,
but she was devoted to her
work.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.417
She was always writing
about patients in her
journal.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.458
She keep this journal
at home or at work?

13:58.542 --> 13:59.625
You got me.

13:59.709 --> 14:00.625
Did she ever talk about

14:00.709 --> 14:02.959
a patient named Pete Scanell?

14:03.041 --> 14:05.041
I only visited there
a few times.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.417
One too many former
thugs working

14:06.500 --> 14:07.875
at tranquility,
if you ask me.

14:07.959 --> 14:11.542
She ever mention
a caseworker, Juan Salazar?

14:11.625 --> 14:14.417
The scary guy with tats?
He gave me the creeps.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.709
- He giving her any trouble?
- 'She didn't say.'

14:16.792 --> 14:18.583
But Julie told me that drugs

14:18.667 --> 14:21.417
were always disappearing
from that place.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.333
Thanks for your time, Vanessa.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.875
Look, Julie was special.

14:27.959 --> 14:29.750
If there's anything
I can do to help

14:29.834 --> 14:32.083
please don't hesitate to call.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.709
[man on speaker]
'This is a quadrant four
security check.'

14:40.792 --> 14:43.458
(Exley)
'I've seen an increase in
Trayden activity around
here.'

14:43.542 --> 14:46.125
'This is a quadrant four
security check.'

14:46.208 --> 14:47.917
'This is a quadrant four.'

14:48.000 --> 14:51.125
(Exley)
'They're coming for us next!'

14:51.208 --> 14:52.792
Are you Pete Scanell?

14:57.875 --> 15:00.667
(man on radio)
'Fourth quarter, two minutes
to go in a tie game!'

15:00.750 --> 15:03.667
We just want
to talk,
Pete.

15:03.750 --> 15:04.917
Pete, we don't want to hurt you.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.625
(Valens)
'Come on.'

15:13.709 --> 15:14.917
Please don't hurt me!

15:15.000 --> 15:17.125
I don't have the map!

15:17.208 --> 15:18.750
Easy, Pete.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.333
(Pete)
'If you had a heart,
the Traydens would release
us.'

15:23.417 --> 15:25.125
The map shows the way
to the safety quadrant.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.500
It's where they killed
the ethereal body

15:26.583 --> 15:27.667
when the poison
reached their
skulls.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.125
Pete, can you hear me?

15:29.208 --> 15:30.667
They sent out a ray of
energy
from the inner plane

15:30.750 --> 15:34.667
that helps the
listening
devices in the
clouds.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.583
Thank you.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.583
- Do you have any soda?
- Sure.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.458
The first Trayden agent
I met was a nice man.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.875
He said quadrant 16
was the safest.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.667
The inner plane map
will tell you everything.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.500
It shows all the hiding places
from the destructive energy.

15:49.583 --> 15:50.875
Do you remember Dr. Ramierez?

15:52.625 --> 15:54.041
I heard you were
a friend of hers.

15:54.125 --> 15:56.667
She's a doctor.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.792
Everyone says I'm sick.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.875
When did you
last see her?

16:01.959 --> 16:03.792
She couldn't stop the screams.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.041
Are we sure
we can trust her?

16:18.834 --> 16:20.417
I think she's dangerous.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.709
I thought you
might be here, Pete.

16:22.792 --> 16:23.959
Are you all right?

16:27.750 --> 16:29.375
After the rain stopped

16:29.458 --> 16:30.709
a Trayden rainbow appeared.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.834
Rainbows can be used
for etheric travel.

16:32.917 --> 16:37.417
Is that right? Well, could
you trust Dr. Ramierez, Pete?

16:37.500 --> 16:38.542
'You ever want
to hurt her?'

16:38.625 --> 16:40.041
Exley knew the danger signs.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.291
He calls me and he tells me
when it's safe.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.083
This Exley..

16:44.166 --> 16:45.667
...he another
patient
of Dr. Ramierez?

16:45.750 --> 16:48.166
Exley's the ensign
for the Inner Plane Soul
Force.

16:48.250 --> 16:53.166
Oh, yeah? Well...did Exley
want to hurt Dr. Ramierez?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.041
You're one of them, aren't you?

16:57.208 --> 17:00.041
"V-A-L ensign."

17:00.125 --> 17:01.625
I should have guessed.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.250
- How stupid do you think I
am?
- It's okay.

17:06.333 --> 17:09.125
No, and you are a Trayden whore!

17:15.417 --> 17:16.750
Hello, Exley.

17:16.834 --> 17:19.250
[whispers]
No. I can't talk right now.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.834
It's not safe.
It's not safe.

17:24.417 --> 17:29.041
You never told me you turned
tricks for The Traydens.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.625
I checked the weather
the morning she died.

17:31.709 --> 17:32.959
It was raining.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.709
It's a coincidence.
Nothing he said made sense.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.291
Well, maybe he saw something.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.500
Like himself killing her?

17:37.583 --> 17:39.291
Well, Galton said
Pete's not violent.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.333
That guy's a spin
doctor
for the mentally ill.

17:41.417 --> 17:42.959
Look, doer or not, Pete's a sick

17:43.041 --> 17:44.333
scared kid
who needs his meds.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.250
And we need answers
about Julie.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.625
I think this kid
could have them.

17:47.709 --> 17:49.291
He don't know what
day it is, Lil.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.959
How did you do
with Pete
Scanell?

17:52.041 --> 17:53.458
He might be our guy

17:53.542 --> 17:55.625
but he's making no
sense,
he's real bad off.

17:55.709 --> 17:58.208
Well, Vera got a hit on
Julie's
gas card the night she died.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.917
7:30 pm she gassed up
her car in Southwark.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.959
Got to be ten miles
from her house.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.458
Nowhere near tranquility.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.709
Well, 302 Scanell.
Get him with social services.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.834
Boss, we do that, we'll never
get another shot at him alone.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.500
And if he goes off,
we all end up in a jackpot.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.417
Kick him to the shrinks.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.834
(Bell)
'What, you couldn't
have told me this before?'

18:19.917 --> 18:21.417
''Cause I was supposed
to see her in her play.'

18:21.500 --> 18:23.333
'Now she's gonna
think I forgot.'

18:23.417 --> 18:25.250
We'll talk later.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.834
- Son of a bitch.
- A tough case?

18:28.917 --> 18:33.250
Yeah. My ex-wife, AKA soul
crusher.

18:33.333 --> 18:36.166
Keeps trading visitation
days with my daughter.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.333
God only knows what
she's telling her about me.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.041
Still owe you that lunch.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.667
Oh, thanks.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.417
So, um, how's it going
with Scanell?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.750
Well, the judge
is
playing hardball

18:46.834 --> 18:49.458
with Dr.
Ramierez's
patient records.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.375
You ask for her
personal notes yet?

18:51.458 --> 18:52.875
Is there a difference?

18:52.959 --> 18:56.834
Yeah. They're not covered
by confidentiality laws.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.875
What about journals?

18:58.959 --> 19:00.458
And wisdom
to know the difference.

19:00.542 --> 19:02.208
Courage and grace to you all.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.375
- Good meeting.
- Good meeting.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.458
Keep it clean.
Keep it clean.

19:04.542 --> 19:05.875
Clean and sober.
Clean and sober.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.417
Clean and sober.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.792
(Miller)
'Juan Salazar?'

19:09.875 --> 19:11.583
Detectives Vera, Miller.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.375
Philly homicide.

19:13.458 --> 19:14.875
You worked with
Julie Ramierez?

19:14.959 --> 19:17.375
Sure, yeah.
Julie was an amazing
soul.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.041
You clean when you were
at tranquility?

19:19.125 --> 19:21.250
I was a
caseworker.
Helping others.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.542
You mean,
helping yourself to tramadol?

19:23.625 --> 19:25.125
Got popped for possession
of painkillers

19:25.208 --> 19:26.875
two days before Julie died.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.083
I had a relapse.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.208
You know, the
journey's
not always

19:29.291 --> 19:30.500
how we plan it, detectives.

19:30.583 --> 19:31.750
Well, we're going to be taking
you on a journey

19:31.834 --> 19:33.417
downtown, you keep lying to us.

19:33.500 --> 19:37.333
Julie find out, threaten
to turn you in? Get you fired?

19:37.417 --> 19:39.583
No, and I would
never
hurt that angel.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.583
She got me back into rehab.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.375
I was in Arizona when she died.

19:43.458 --> 19:46.542
At Hope Waters, you know,
finding the sober road.

19:46.625 --> 19:47.625
You can check.

19:47.709 --> 19:49.125
'You were Pete Scanell's
caseworker.'

19:49.208 --> 19:50.542
Julie having a
tough time with him?

19:50.625 --> 19:52.417
Hell, no. She worked
miracles
for that kid.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.250
(Julie)
'I think the music's
helping.'

20:03.333 --> 20:04.917
'He's opening up.'

20:05.000 --> 20:06.417
He taking his meds?

20:06.500 --> 20:08.417
Prolixin-haloperidol-loxitane.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.208
Five and two, two dose.

20:10.291 --> 20:12.291
Like clockwork.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.208
I'm listening to Lennon.

20:21.291 --> 20:22.750
"#9 dream."

20:22.834 --> 20:24.208
Beautiful song.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.500
It makes me feel like
I'm floating when I hear it.

20:27.583 --> 20:31.291
It makes me feel..

20:35.542 --> 20:38.875
Feels like what, Pete?

20:38.959 --> 20:40.458
Like I'm getting better.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.291
You are getting better.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.667
Thing is,
schizophrenics
don't get better.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.291
Maybe music helped calm him

20:55.375 --> 20:57.750
but all you can really do is
medicate and contain
relapses.

20:57.834 --> 20:58.834
Ever see Pete get violent?

20:58.917 --> 21:00.500
No, the key for a schizophrenic

21:00.583 --> 21:02.834
is finding someone he can trust.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.166
Pete had that in Doc Ramierez.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.000
Well, we will check
on your sober road

21:06.083 --> 21:08.667
at Hope Waters, Salazar.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.417
Keep it real.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.083
Hey. You kick Pete?

21:19.166 --> 21:21.333
Downstairs.

21:21.417 --> 21:23.500
Boss finds out,
it's your ass, not mine.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.166
Salazar looks good?

21:25.250 --> 21:29.000
Nope. New age douchebag's
alibi checked out.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.917
Someone else's didn't.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.333
Vanessa Quarterman.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.458
Try Rachel Liebowitz.

21:35.542 --> 21:37.000
Multiple personalities?

21:37.083 --> 21:42.417
HR. rep at that investment bank
said she was just a secretary.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.333
And a pathological liar.

21:45.417 --> 21:50.500
Check fraud, insurance fraud,
shoplifting. A busy woman.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.542
That company made her go into
mandatory counseling

21:52.625 --> 21:55.458
for harassing another
female employee.

21:55.542 --> 21:58.083
And Julie was her doctor
at tranquility.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.166
The night Julie
died,
you said you were

22:08.250 --> 22:09.834
at home with your daughter?

22:09.917 --> 22:11.917
The one you named
after Julie?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.291
She just started kindergarten.

22:14.375 --> 22:18.083
She can do the whole
alphabet
except "w."

22:18.166 --> 22:20.166
Always forgets that one.

22:20.250 --> 22:23.041
Damn,
you're good,
huh?

22:23.125 --> 22:27.250
"Except w."
That's a great
detail.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.750
[chuckles]
I don't understand.

22:28.834 --> 22:30.667
Let's cut the crap.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.000
Your daughter's real
name
is "don't exist."

22:33.083 --> 22:35.917
You've been in trouble
since you were a kid.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.417
Rachel Liebowitz,
West Philly High dropout.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.583
(Miller)
'Kappa my ass.'

22:40.667 --> 22:42.834
You were Julie's
patient
at Tranquility.

22:42.917 --> 22:44.959
You were stalking her.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.792
I..

22:50.542 --> 22:54.250
I had an unhealthy obsession

22:54.333 --> 22:57.375
called "transfer
neurosis."
It's in the DSM IV.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.625
And you're about to spend
the night in an unhealthy
place

22:59.709 --> 23:02.291
if you don't drop
the psychobabble
lies.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.166
Julie was a goddess.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.625
I would've walked into
that fire to save her.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.083
Her problem was not with me.

23:29.417 --> 23:32.625
Dr. Jack Galton.

23:32.709 --> 23:34.250
Man was a vindictive blowhard.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.750
And we should believe you, why?

23:35.834 --> 23:38.917
I don't care what you believe.

23:39.041 --> 23:40.375
Guy was in the pants
of half the nurses.

23:40.458 --> 23:41.667
He was all wrong for her.

23:41.750 --> 23:44.375
You're saying that was
the cause of the fight?

23:44.458 --> 23:45.792
They were more than friends?

23:45.875 --> 23:47.458
I think she was
gonna finally dump
him.

23:47.542 --> 23:51.041
Last time. Where were
you the night Julie died?

23:55.917 --> 23:57.667
I really was at home.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.417
I was just alone.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.083
That'll be all, Geneva.

24:11.875 --> 24:13.166
(Valens)
'Sorry to barge in, doc.'

24:13.250 --> 24:14.583
Got a couple
follow-up questions.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.333
Sure. Sit.

24:16.417 --> 24:18.917
You called Julie
the night she died?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.500
I did.

24:20.583 --> 24:23.250
- Where were you?
- I was here working late.

24:23.333 --> 24:25.041
It wasn't like
her
to not show up.

24:25.125 --> 24:28.667
- She didn't answer the phone?
- No. I wish she had.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.458
See, it was a..

24:34.583 --> 24:36.166
...12 minute call.

24:36.250 --> 24:39.458
You really just co-workers or
there something more going on?

24:39.542 --> 24:40.417
More?

24:40.500 --> 24:41.709
Yeah, more, like she dumps

24:41.792 --> 24:43.375
your sorry ass,
you just can't let her go.

24:43.458 --> 24:44.709
You fight on the phone,
drive over--

24:44.792 --> 24:47.417
We were colleagues.
Nothing more.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.709
Of course we had
professional
disagreements.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.583
Disagreement turn
into a funeral pyre?

24:51.667 --> 24:54.542
We were talking about a patient.

24:54.625 --> 24:56.750
- I can't discuss it.
- Right. Court order.

24:56.834 --> 24:59.208
Well, how about you not discuss
it on the way to the roundhouse?

24:59.291 --> 25:01.250
I was trying to
protect
Julie's memory.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.750
She was misguided.

25:03.834 --> 25:05.834
Music therapy for schizophrenia?

25:05.917 --> 25:07.792
It's...it's absurd.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.166
Yeah, but Pete was doing better.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.583
He had started cheeking.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.208
- Cheeking?
- Not swallowing his meds.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.250
He'd lie to her about it.

25:16.333 --> 25:19.041
She'd turn a blind eye to it.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.959
Pete, calm down. Relax.

25:35.041 --> 25:37.709
- What's wrong?
- Trayden spy!

25:37.792 --> 25:40.750
Exley said you stole
his sector five
document!

25:40.834 --> 25:42.917
Give it back!

25:47.834 --> 25:50.250
I thought you said
Pete was timid.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.291
A small percentage
of schizophrenics

25:52.375 --> 25:53.709
are more prone to violence.

25:53.792 --> 25:55.250
I had to use an
extraordinary
amount

25:55.333 --> 25:57.000
of medication to calm
Pete after that
episode.

25:57.083 --> 26:00.000
- That why Julie was mad at you?
- She thought I was gorking him.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.333
Gork? Speak English, doc.

26:01.417 --> 26:04.083
Overmedicating, turning
him
into a zombie.

26:04.166 --> 26:06.125
The meds have side effects.

26:06.208 --> 26:09.250
The alternative is worse.

26:09.333 --> 26:12.417
Pete Scanell
disappeared
the day before Julie
died.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.792
You saying Pete went after her?

26:14.875 --> 26:17.333
Schizophrenics are always
looking for a safe person

26:17.417 --> 26:18.458
a safe place.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.083
He know where she lived?

26:20.166 --> 26:23.792
That morning I...I found
him
in her office

26:23.875 --> 26:26.709
searching her purse,
going through her
mail.

26:30.041 --> 26:32.542
See, this is the sub-portal
transport design.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.208
It'll be a gateway
to the inner plane.

26:35.291 --> 26:37.083
Is the inner plane a
safe place for you,
Pete?

26:37.166 --> 26:40.333
If the vibrations aren't in
flux, I can travel there
safely.

26:40.417 --> 26:44.000
Was Dr. Ramierez's house
a safe place for you?

26:44.083 --> 26:45.417
Pete, when you saw the rainbow

26:45.500 --> 26:47.709
did you go to her
house?
Did you have a key?

26:47.792 --> 26:50.500
We should not be discussing
this. It's dangerous.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.959
Did dr. Ramierez
ever go to the inner
plane?

26:53.041 --> 26:55.917
No! No,
she didn't have clearance!

26:56.000 --> 26:57.250
'Exley has clearance.'

26:57.333 --> 26:58.917
God, how many times
do I have to tell you people?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.834
- Did she know Mr. Exley?
- Let's take a break, Lil.

27:00.917 --> 27:02.041
She never met Exley.

27:02.125 --> 27:03.834
I gave her a picture
of him and me.

27:03.917 --> 27:08.375
She kept it in her
journal. It was strange.

27:08.458 --> 27:09.667
What was strange?

27:09.750 --> 27:11.417
When I gave her the picture..

27:11.500 --> 27:13.542
she started to cry.

27:13.625 --> 27:16.000
Exley does not like
to be photographed.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.417
He understands
the danger.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.500
And this is dangerous.
Dangerous!

27:20.583 --> 27:22.291
Lil..

27:22.375 --> 27:25.458
It's okay,
Pete.
We're done.

27:26.792 --> 27:28.166
You keep this guy any longer

27:28.250 --> 27:29.750
he's liable to hurt himself.

27:29.834 --> 27:31.542
I've seen it, Lil.

27:31.625 --> 27:32.917
A guard's watching.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.458
Well, he needs
a doctor.

27:34.542 --> 27:36.041
I need to see
her
journal first.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.542
It was important enough
for Pete to mention it.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.291
So you get notes
on the inner plane?

27:39.375 --> 27:40.709
Picture of a guy
who isn't real?

27:40.792 --> 27:42.792
He had no reason
to kill her,
Scotty.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.500
Well, maybe
Julie set him off.

27:44.583 --> 27:47.250
I mean, he assaulted Galton
over Trayden documents.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.583
We figure out where
he went that day

27:48.667 --> 27:50.417
we put him at the scene
or rule him out.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.083
Holding desk tells me you
still
got Pete Scanell downstairs.

27:53.166 --> 27:54.542
I just need a
little more
time.

27:54.625 --> 27:57.458
- I told you to 302 him.
- Yeah, sorry, boss.

27:57.542 --> 28:00.125
It was my idea.
We're getting close.

28:00.208 --> 28:02.417
- To what?
- The truth.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.917
9:00 A.M. I want him gone.

28:07.583 --> 28:10.917
- Will's back.
- Welcome back.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.750
Get lost on the
way home, Will?

28:12.834 --> 28:14.000
I'm back to work.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.834
No, not today,
soldier.
Get some rest.

28:15.917 --> 28:17.125
There'll be a
nice,
comfortable desk

28:17.208 --> 28:18.583
waiting for you
when you get
back.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.917
What the hell am I gonna do
at home, John?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.041
Besides,
it smells like Vera.

28:25.208 --> 28:27.417
There you go.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.250
Ramierez's journal.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.208
The judge owe you one?

28:32.291 --> 28:34.291
Just solid case law, my friend.

28:34.375 --> 28:37.291
Requisitioned from
a storage room at Tranquility.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.000
- Messengered it over.
- Thanks.

28:39.083 --> 28:41.333
I owe you..

28:41.417 --> 28:42.792
...a new kitty sticker.

28:42.875 --> 28:45.375
Yeah, my daughter's going
through a sticker phase.

28:45.458 --> 28:46.667
Been awhile
since I last saw her.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.709
This thing's
barely holding on.

28:48.792 --> 28:50.166
Never made it
to that play?

28:50.250 --> 28:53.959
Uh, no, no.
The ex wouldn't budge.

28:54.041 --> 28:56.125
It's like I'm watching a home
movie of her growing up

28:56.208 --> 28:58.250
only I'm not in it.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.125
Sorry to hear.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.834
Yeah, she'd be happy
if I walked away.

29:01.917 --> 29:04.291
- Just gave up, you know?
- What about your daughter?

29:04.375 --> 29:08.583
No, never wanted
to start a tug-o-war. What?

29:08.667 --> 29:12.125
You never seemed like the kinda
guy to give up without a fight.

29:39.750 --> 29:42.333
- Exley's real.
- Come on, Lil.

29:42.417 --> 29:45.625
Julie was trying to understand
what triggered Pete's illness.

29:45.709 --> 29:48.583
- Some kind of trauma, right?
- No, she figured it out.

29:48.667 --> 29:50.750
See, when Pete was six

29:50.834 --> 29:53.083
he was trapped in a house
fire
with his older brother.

29:54.875 --> 29:58.041
Brother died in a fire?

29:58.125 --> 30:00.375
This was clipped
inside her
journal..

30:00.458 --> 30:02.917
Pete and his brother Michael.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.542
Looks like a happy,
healthy kid.

30:04.625 --> 30:07.709
But brother's dressed
exactly
like Pete described Exley.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.625
Well, Galton said the voices
a schizophrenic hears

30:11.709 --> 30:13.041
usually start off as a friend.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.959
Or a family member.

30:15.041 --> 30:16.250
It gets better.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.041
The inner plane?

30:20.542 --> 30:22.667
Check it out.

30:27.041 --> 30:29.291
It's a jungle gym.

30:29.375 --> 30:31.750
His safe place
when he was a kid.

30:31.834 --> 30:34.583
Maybe he had one in Philly.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.875
Last entry, the day she died

30:36.959 --> 30:39.834
"I think I know where Pete
ran.
It's his safe place."

30:39.917 --> 30:42.583
The gas station
where Julie filled up at..

30:42.667 --> 30:44.792
gotta be a park nearby.

30:56.417 --> 30:57.834
"Exley."

31:01.000 --> 31:02.083
'Julie found him here.'

31:02.166 --> 31:04.417
Maybe she told him Exley
wasn't really the

31:04.500 --> 31:06.166
ensign of the inner plane.

31:06.250 --> 31:07.333
What's that matter?

31:07.417 --> 31:08.458
She thought if she
talked to Pete

31:08.542 --> 31:10.417
about his trigger..

31:10.500 --> 31:11.667
...it would help him.

31:11.750 --> 31:12.750
She was fighting his delusion.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.083
Tried to take him away from

31:14.166 --> 31:16.208
the park,
the jungle gym..

31:16.291 --> 31:18.792
His safe place.

31:18.875 --> 31:21.625
He got upset..

31:21.709 --> 31:24.917
I was wrong about Pete.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.542
So was Julie.

31:41.709 --> 31:45.083
I just got off the phone
with the CIA.

31:45.166 --> 31:47.000
They want a full report
about the fire

31:47.083 --> 31:48.375
at Dr. Ramierez's house.

31:48.458 --> 31:49.750
The CIA?

31:49.834 --> 31:51.375
You were right, Pete.

31:51.458 --> 31:53.667
There's been an influx
of Trayden activity.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.458
The Traydens are an FBI
detail.
Strictly federal.

31:56.542 --> 32:00.041
No, no, this is bigger
than you imagined.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.500
We need your help, Pete.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.625
Can you do that?
Can you help us out?

32:04.709 --> 32:05.667
I want to help.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.834
You told me you were sitting

32:06.917 --> 32:08.792
with Exley when
you saw the rainbow.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.208
Dr. Ramierez walked towards you.

32:10.291 --> 32:13.250
- Exley didn't trust her.
- Oh, he was right.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.625
Did dr. Ramierez take you
away, try to trick you?

32:16.709 --> 32:20.000
- This is dangerous.
- I know it is.

32:20.083 --> 32:21.834
You need to be strong.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.000
You trust me, right?

32:25.083 --> 32:27.000
- I do.
- Then tell me what happened.

32:27.083 --> 32:29.792
She said Exley wasn't real.

32:29.875 --> 32:32.291
If you deny, you're part of it.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.333
I didn't want to hurt her,
but the Traydens are evil

32:35.417 --> 32:37.375
and their soul force
cannot be extinguished

32:37.458 --> 32:40.834
by just any manner of death.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.917
They have to burn.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.917
Thanks, Mr. Exley.

33:11.792 --> 33:14.500
Why would she betray me?

33:14.583 --> 33:17.625
Pete, Julie was already
on the living room floor

33:17.709 --> 33:18.792
when you walked in.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.709
Well, Pete, how did you
hurt Dr. Ramierez?

33:20.792 --> 33:22.208
- Did you hit her?
- I don't remember.

33:22.291 --> 33:24.917
- I was tired.
- This is important, Pete.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.917
Remember.
Close your eyes.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.166
You can do it.

33:33.208 --> 33:34.875
When She found you
at the park..

33:36.250 --> 33:38.417
...and took you home with her.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.375
To listen to music.

33:40.458 --> 33:42.083
We were talking
about the
picture.

33:42.166 --> 33:43.667
The picture.

33:43.750 --> 33:44.917
That one with your brother?

33:45.000 --> 33:48.583
He came back to me in college.

33:48.667 --> 33:52.000
He used to help me,
give me advice,
but..

33:52.083 --> 33:54.333
...then he went away.

33:54.417 --> 33:56.792
You used to go
to the park
together?

33:56.875 --> 33:58.625
We used to play
on the jungle gym

33:58.709 --> 34:01.417
watch the other kids
on the tire ride.

34:16.875 --> 34:19.542
Watching the wheels.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.667
That's my favorite
John Lennon song.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.375
Yeah, it's a good one.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.583
So you didn't get mad when
she talked about your past?

34:25.667 --> 34:28.667
No. It just makes me tired.

34:28.750 --> 34:33.125
I...I didn't want to hurt her.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.417
But I got the call.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.458
From Exley?

34:37.542 --> 34:39.500
Do you remember
what time Exley called?

34:39.583 --> 34:42.000
I hung up at 10:14.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.291
Saw it on the phone.

34:48.375 --> 34:50.375
Were you on a phone like this?

34:50.458 --> 34:53.834
No. Dr. Ramierez
gave me her cell
phone

34:53.917 --> 34:55.208
when she found me at the park

34:55.291 --> 34:57.083
said call her if
I got lost again.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.000
Then that call was real.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.834
'What did Exley tell you?'

35:00.917 --> 35:02.083
(Pete)
'He said..'

35:02.166 --> 35:03.959
...Dr. Ramierez was evil.

35:04.041 --> 35:05.125
Yeah?

35:05.208 --> 35:08.875
That her soul
had to be extinguished.

35:08.959 --> 35:11.417
I burned the house.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.500
I hurt her.

35:13.583 --> 35:15.166
You didn't hurt anyone, Pete.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.417
You understand?

35:17.500 --> 35:19.667
What time was Galton's
phone call to Julie?

35:19.750 --> 35:22.291
10:02 to 10:14.

35:22.375 --> 35:25.500
This doc had some kind
of personal beef with her.

35:25.583 --> 35:28.375
Or professional.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.834
What else do we know
about the good doctor?

35:34.208 --> 35:36.542
I appreciate you
coming in, doctor.

35:36.625 --> 35:37.875
Anything to help.

35:37.959 --> 35:40.417
Man, this
psychology stuff.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.166
All these..

35:42.250 --> 35:44.208
...disorders,
it's pretty complex.

35:44.291 --> 35:46.917
I've published a
number
of books that are
easy...

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
...for the layman.

35:48.083 --> 35:51.375
Yeah? I might
have to borrow one.

35:51.458 --> 35:55.875
Uh, I mean, you guys got a
pill
for every little problem.

35:55.959 --> 35:58.375
There's one called..

35:58.458 --> 36:01.291
...man, these medical words.

36:01.375 --> 36:05.041
- "Halo... per..."
- Haloperidol.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.417
- Yeah, yeah, what is that?
- It's a neuroleptic.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.750
It's helps
alleviate
numerous symptoms.

36:09.834 --> 36:14.750
From what I get,
it's basically an
antipsychotic.

36:14.834 --> 36:18.250
That's not bad...I've been
reading this thing.

36:18.333 --> 36:21.208
I'm not sure I follow.

36:21.291 --> 36:22.917
We're looking
into the medication

36:23.000 --> 36:24.417
that was stolen
from the clinic.

36:24.500 --> 36:29.458
Uh, Burglary report
filed by tranquility
in '04.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.417
Antipsychotics
went missing, too.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.583
- You know anything about that?
- No.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.709
Pete was on haloperidol.

36:35.792 --> 36:38.041
It's used to help
treat schizophrenia.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.458
Thing is, it could also
help with uh

36:40.542 --> 36:42.625
narcissistic
personality disorder.

36:42.709 --> 36:45.709
- You familiar with that one?
- Of course.

36:45.792 --> 36:49.083
Would you mind, uh,
reading the definition out
loud?

36:49.166 --> 36:52.250
'Cause I'll just
mess up the words.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.667
"Symptoms of NPD

37:00.750 --> 37:03.458
"are a pervasive
pattern
of grandiosity

37:03.542 --> 37:05.458
"and need for admiration.

37:05.542 --> 37:08.542
"patient has a sense of
entitlement, is exploitative

37:08.625 --> 37:11.125
'"and takes advantage
of others to his own end.'

37:11.208 --> 37:14.875
Shows arrogant behaviors..
or attitudes."

37:14.959 --> 37:17.375
That sounds like a fancy way
of saying someone's a..

37:17.458 --> 37:18.625
...horse's ass.

37:18.709 --> 37:19.625
'It sounds like someone'

37:19.709 --> 37:20.959
'who'd make his patients'

37:21.041 --> 37:22.166
'wash his car.'

37:22.250 --> 37:24.208
Someone who'd
dip into their money.

37:24.291 --> 37:27.166
And hire former
patients
like Geneva

37:27.250 --> 37:28.792
to be at his
beck and call

37:28.875 --> 37:30.375
treat him like a king.

37:30.458 --> 37:33.458
Kind of sounds...like you.

37:33.542 --> 37:34.500
What the hell is this?

37:34.583 --> 37:35.834
You stole Pete's meds to do

37:35.917 --> 37:37.333
a little self-medicating.

37:37.417 --> 37:38.792
That's why he was pissed at you.

37:38.875 --> 37:41.709
"Give it back."
He was talking about his
pills.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.625
So what,
you're-you're...you're
a doctor now?

37:43.709 --> 37:45.625
No. But Julie was.

37:45.709 --> 37:47.291
So she diagnosed you with..

37:47.375 --> 37:50.458
...ah, narcissistic
personality
disorder in her complaint

37:50.542 --> 37:52.583
to the AMA. Care
to read that one,
too?

37:52.667 --> 37:54.041
- I don't have to listen
to--
- Of course not.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.125
You're the executive
director of

37:55.208 --> 37:57.000
the Pennsylvania Medical Group.

37:57.083 --> 37:59.709
Diagnosed by a woman who'd only
been practicing three years.

37:59.792 --> 38:00.917
You've written books..

38:01.000 --> 38:02.959
That sold 12 copies.

38:03.041 --> 38:04.166
'You know, maybe
she was right.'

38:04.250 --> 38:06.500
Incompetent,
arrogant and abusive.

38:06.583 --> 38:08.291
You sure you went
to med school, doc?

38:08.375 --> 38:09.834
Julie's be running
that place by now

38:09.917 --> 38:11.625
if she were still alive.

38:11.709 --> 38:13.291
But unlike you,
she actually
cared

38:13.375 --> 38:16.041
about her patients,
about helping people.

38:16.125 --> 38:17.542
I care deeply.

38:17.625 --> 38:20.667
You people have no idea..

38:20.750 --> 38:21.875
...the good work I do.

38:21.959 --> 38:24.166
I have won
countless grants and
honors.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.834
I have set therapeutic goals

38:25.917 --> 38:27.041
for patients that Julie

38:27.125 --> 38:30.834
was too narrow-minded
to comprehend.

38:30.917 --> 38:34.083
I have patients that
admire and respect me.

38:34.166 --> 38:36.542
Me! Not Julie! Me!

38:36.625 --> 38:38.041
So you went to her house
to straighten her out.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.041
You bet I did.

38:39.125 --> 38:40.166
But she wouldn't listen to you.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.542
She had to be stopped.

38:42.625 --> 38:45.750
She was sick.

38:52.792 --> 38:55.041
I called you earlier, and..

38:55.125 --> 38:56.875
Pete Scanell answered.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.583
What's going on, Julie?

38:59.667 --> 39:01.458
I gave him my cell
phone,
just in case.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.417
You gave him your phone? When?

39:03.500 --> 39:06.000
He can't be on the
street,
Dr. Galton.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.625
So, you brought him
home with you.

39:11.709 --> 39:13.875
He's...he's
asleep
in the basement.

39:13.959 --> 39:15.291
He needs a place to stay.

39:15.375 --> 39:17.625
So you think he's better off
here than at Tranquility.

39:17.709 --> 39:19.917
He said he ran away because you
took something from his room.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.291
This from a kid who
hallucinates
on a daily basis.

39:22.375 --> 39:23.792
I believe him, Jack.

39:23.875 --> 39:26.583
- You took his meds.
- He has no concept of
reality.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.083
The disease eradicated it.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.834
The disease didn't eradicate
his sense of honesty, his
soul.

39:31.917 --> 39:33.834
He's a good kid,
and I believe in him.

39:33.917 --> 39:35.959
- And you say I cross lines.
- Excuse me?

39:36.041 --> 39:38.709
The complaint you filed
against me with the AMA.

39:38.792 --> 39:40.834
'You didn't think I'd find out
about that, the people I know?'

39:40.917 --> 39:43.333
- Please, keep your voice
down.
- Don't tell me what to do.

39:43.417 --> 39:45.875
I've seen with my own eyes
how you treat the patients.

39:45.959 --> 39:48.000
Tomorrow you will call the AMA

39:48.083 --> 39:49.375
and tell them
you made a mistake.

39:49.458 --> 39:50.959
I'm sorry, Jack,
I can't do that.

39:51.041 --> 39:52.917
You will do what I say!

40:01.792 --> 40:03.417
I think you need help.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.250
Dr. Kellerman is
expecting your
call.

40:05.333 --> 40:08.333
What, what, uh, what
you're gonna analyze me?

40:08.417 --> 40:10.417
- You're sick, Jack.
- Sick?

40:10.500 --> 40:12.625
- I treat the sick.
- You're not helping them.

40:12.709 --> 40:14.583
You've got to
help
yourself first.

40:14.667 --> 40:16.792
You know nothing!

40:23.375 --> 40:24.959
[gasps]
Pete.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.333
Pete.

40:42.417 --> 40:45.417
It's Exley.

40:46.583 --> 40:47.750
There's a problem
I need you

40:47.834 --> 40:49.709
to take care of.

40:56.542 --> 40:58.166
Good news, Pete.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.667
I found a caseworker
who pulled some
strings

41:00.750 --> 41:02.667
got you in a board and care.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.792
They'll get you
back on your meds

41:05.875 --> 41:07.834
take care of you.

41:09.458 --> 41:10.792
Okay.

41:13.500 --> 41:16.000
And I want you to know..

41:16.083 --> 41:18.542
Julie believed in you.

41:18.625 --> 41:19.875
You understand?

41:23.792 --> 41:25.250
Uh, Ms. Rush?

41:29.709 --> 41:31.625
Yes?

41:31.709 --> 41:33.709
This place..

41:33.792 --> 41:35.875
You've done a sweep
for listening devices

41:35.959 --> 41:38.000
it's safe, right?

41:38.083 --> 41:39.291
It's safe, Pete.
