WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:02.408
Does anybody know what today is?

00:03.444 --> 00:06.376
Your birthday?

00:06.376 --> 00:07.278
All: Oh.

00:07.279 --> 00:08.476
Happy birthday, Amy.

00:08.478 --> 00:11.179
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- No.

00:11.181 --> 00:13.982
- Happy birthday, Amy!
- May you live for another 45.

00:13.984 --> 00:16.751
I am not 45, and it's not my birthday.

00:16.753 --> 00:19.275
It's Employee Appreciation Day!

00:19.276 --> 00:22.091
Whoo! Everybody get psyched!

00:23.017 --> 00:25.121
What is Employee Appreciation Day?

00:25.122 --> 00:25.987
It's symbolic.

00:25.988 --> 00:27.762
I think it's a holiday in Canada.

00:27.764 --> 00:30.373
Nope, it's our way of saying thank you

00:30.374 --> 00:33.001
for all the amazing work
you do every day.

00:33.003 --> 00:35.588
This store could not function
without you guys.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.956
I mean, not you
specifically, obviously,

00:38.963 --> 00:40.238
but labor of some sort.

00:40.239 --> 00:41.295
Aww.

00:41.295 --> 00:44.532
It's weird how Employee
Appreciation Day

00:44.533 --> 00:46.903
always seems to fall right
around when people are

00:46.904 --> 00:48.336
filling out their union cards.

00:48.337 --> 00:49.369
Mm.

00:49.370 --> 00:52.954
Anyway, we're gonna have little
special surprises all day long.

00:52.956 --> 00:54.856
- We've got ice cream...
- all: Ooh.

00:54.858 --> 00:56.758
- We've got a masseuse...
- all: Ooh.

00:56.759 --> 00:58.966
And we've got Cloud 9
Frisbees for the kids.

00:58.967 --> 01:00.928
And for those of you
who wanna join the union,

01:00.930 --> 01:02.375
we've got collective bargaining rights,

01:02.376 --> 01:04.197
higher wages, and job security.

01:04.199 --> 01:07.198
Sorry, for the massages,
should we be in, like, a towel

01:07.199 --> 01:08.699
or just totally buck naked?

01:08.700 --> 01:09.967
Neither, fully clothed.

01:09.968 --> 01:11.441
Clothed for the ice cream too?

01:11.441 --> 01:14.142
Yes, everybody keep their clothes on.

01:14.144 --> 01:16.144
It's ridiculous how often
I have to say that.

01:16.146 --> 01:18.884
Speaking of clothes,
who wants a free T-shirt?

01:18.885 --> 01:20.181
Ooh.

01:24.587 --> 01:25.932
You missed me.

01:33.639 --> 01:37.398
Attention shoppers, today is
Employee Appreciation Day,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.001
and all of our associates
are getting free ice cream.

01:40.003 --> 01:42.437
So if you're wondering why
everything's sticky,

01:42.439 --> 01:43.850
that's one of the reasons.

01:44.474 --> 01:47.938
Have you tried the Cloud
9 Corporate sundae?

01:47.939 --> 01:49.811
What it is, is they give you

01:49.813 --> 01:52.113
a very, very tiny bit of ice cream

01:52.115 --> 01:55.644
with nothing on top and then
you just have to take it.

01:55.645 --> 01:58.297
No, actually, I tried
the Union Surprise.

01:58.298 --> 02:00.655
It's every flavor you could ever want

02:00.657 --> 02:02.990
and every topping you
could ever dream of,

02:02.992 --> 02:05.126
but then they shut down
the store and fire you,

02:05.128 --> 02:06.427
and you get nothing.

02:06.429 --> 02:09.098
It's probably not a popular flavor.

02:09.933 --> 02:12.100
I can't believe you're
siding with corporate.

02:12.102 --> 02:13.801
Jonah, what do you want me to do?

02:13.803 --> 02:16.308
I want you to say [bleep]
corporate and be on our side.

02:16.309 --> 02:18.539
They will shut down the store.
You know that.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.504
So we'll get other stores involved.
They can't shut us all down.

02:20.505 --> 02:23.444
Oh, okay, so now you're leading
a nationwide movement?

02:23.446 --> 02:24.407
If not now, when?

02:24.408 --> 02:26.147
Literally any other time.

02:26.149 --> 02:30.178
Just not right when I finally have a
job that pays well and has a future.

02:30.179 --> 02:33.050
Okay, so this is about
you saving your job?

02:33.051 --> 02:35.238
Yeah, and everybody else's.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.024
I mean, you might have nothing to lose,

02:37.026 --> 02:39.631
but a lot of us can't just
say "[bleep] corporate,"

02:39.632 --> 02:42.891
and risk everything, because Jonah
needs a cause to fight for.

02:42.892 --> 02:43.878
You guys fighting?

02:43.991 --> 02:45.051
- No.
- We're fine.

02:45.139 --> 02:46.588
Guys, don't fight.

02:48.164 --> 02:50.758
Yeah, that definitely looks infected.

02:51.407 --> 02:54.085
I have to sleep face down
with a wet towel on my back.

02:54.544 --> 02:56.344
This massage is gonna be torture.

02:56.346 --> 02:58.228
Maybe you shouldn't get a massage.

02:58.229 --> 03:00.081
It's a free massage.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.083
I can't wait for union health care.

03:02.085 --> 03:05.025
Did you know if you tell them you
have "migraines," they cover Botox?

03:05.026 --> 03:06.254
My cousin went to Mexico,

03:06.256 --> 03:08.215
and they injected cement into her face.

03:08.216 --> 03:09.390
Still in there.

03:09.392 --> 03:10.491
You can hear it rattle when she talks.

03:10.493 --> 03:13.925
So, you guys are all
thinking about joining, huh?

03:14.364 --> 03:16.998
It's just that, like,
I don't a union giving out

03:17.000 --> 03:18.758
free ice cream and Frisbees, you know.

03:18.759 --> 03:21.002
Yeah, but they give out other stuff.

03:21.004 --> 03:22.937
The teachers at my
high school unionized,

03:22.939 --> 03:25.840
and now there's literally nothing
they can do to get them fired.

03:25.842 --> 03:28.910
Like, Mr. Lackman's still there,
and he's married to a sophomore.

03:28.912 --> 03:30.678
I dated a Teamster, and he gets, like,

03:30.680 --> 03:32.064
seven paid lunches a day.

03:32.065 --> 03:33.615
Seems pretty cool to me.

03:33.616 --> 03:36.281
If your skin was rotting,
you would smell it, right?

03:43.026 --> 03:45.604
Hey, the whole store is
signing union cards.

03:45.606 --> 03:46.611
- What?
- Yeah.

03:46.664 --> 03:48.266
The cleaning crew thought they
were signing birthday cards,

03:48.267 --> 03:49.586
but the signatures still count.

03:49.587 --> 03:50.665
Then once Marcus went union,

03:50.667 --> 03:52.089
all the warehouse guys followed him.

03:52.090 --> 03:53.868
They actually consider
him to be a leader,

03:53.870 --> 03:55.536
which I think is the most
disturbing part of all of this.

03:55.537 --> 03:57.610
Well, we gotta do something.
What do we do?

03:57.611 --> 03:59.640
I don't know. Show an anti-union video.

03:59.648 --> 04:01.447
No, those videos are so dumb.

04:01.524 --> 04:03.511
Yeah. Okay, what else could we do?

04:06.462 --> 04:08.929
Cloud 9, a great place to shop

04:08.978 --> 04:10.434
and a great place to work.

04:10.713 --> 04:14.181
Everybody wants to be here,
including unions.

04:15.725 --> 04:17.058
- So, when you were...
- Shh.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.759
People are trying to watch.

04:18.761 --> 04:20.827
But before you decide, there are...

04:21.550 --> 04:23.251
Studies show that employees

04:23.253 --> 04:24.585
at a non-union facility are

04:24.587 --> 04:26.777
more engaged and happier.

04:26.778 --> 04:29.582
Yeah! Don't try to come
between me and Cloud 9.

04:29.850 --> 04:31.846
- That's my bae.
- Well said.

04:32.027 --> 04:34.180
Not sure who I feel about
this new MC Cool Cloud.

04:34.254 --> 04:36.154
Yeah, there's something
profoundly disturbing about

04:36.156 --> 04:38.563
seeing a two-dimensional cartoon
character in three dimensions.

04:38.564 --> 04:40.198
Like with "The Peanuts Movie."

04:40.199 --> 04:42.727
I had no idea that Charlie Brown was

04:42.729 --> 04:44.729
a bald child with a deformed head.

04:44.731 --> 04:46.564
- It's like a bruised apple.
- I know.

04:46.566 --> 04:48.826
No union better mess with my family.

04:49.106 --> 04:52.663
Oh, MC Cool Cloud,
you're gonna be the best dad.

04:52.664 --> 04:54.187
- Whoa!
- What?!

04:56.743 --> 05:00.373
I'm sorry, did MC Cool Cloud
just impregnate a human?

05:00.374 --> 05:01.190
I think he did.

05:01.191 --> 05:03.515
Okay, does anybody have
any thoughts about the video?

05:03.517 --> 05:05.216
I mean, I'm a little disappointed.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.085
I thought you were
showing us "Paddington."

05:07.086 --> 05:08.226
Uh, no, I never said...

05:08.227 --> 05:10.421
I also heard it was gonna
be "Paddington."

05:10.423 --> 05:12.342
I don't know where these
"Paddington" rumors got started.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.228
I thought it was
a one-sided, fear-mongering

05:15.229 --> 05:16.761
piece of corporate propaganda.

05:16.763 --> 05:17.996
Well, nobody asked your opinion, so...

05:17.998 --> 05:19.597
Oh, I thought you did when you said,

05:19.599 --> 05:21.377
"Does anybody have
any thoughts on this video?"

05:21.470 --> 05:23.368
Well, I found it
interesting to learn that

05:23.370 --> 05:25.393
unions actually limit communication.

05:25.394 --> 05:26.671
Good point, Dina.

05:26.673 --> 05:28.273
It's like when you have a problem,

05:28.275 --> 05:29.941
do you wanna be able
to come straight to me

05:29.943 --> 05:32.897
or do you wanna have to go through
some shop steward like in the video?

05:32.898 --> 05:34.952
Definitely you. That guy was a dick.

05:34.953 --> 05:36.560
Where do I know him from?

05:36.694 --> 05:38.817
Oh, he's in that rheumatoid
arthritis commercial

05:38.819 --> 05:40.351
where he can't pick up
his grandkids and he's sad.

05:40.353 --> 05:43.021
Oh, yeah, and then the dog
drops the ball at his feet,

05:43.023 --> 05:45.307
and he just shakes his head
like, "Can't do it, buddy."

05:45.307 --> 05:45.886
Aww.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.892
So, if you can just help us
with our problems,

05:47.894 --> 05:49.405
my hours keep getting cut,

05:49.406 --> 05:51.062
and I don't make a livable wage.

05:51.064 --> 05:53.077
Well, I do help you with that,
because I pay the rent.

05:53.078 --> 05:55.166
- All: Oh!
- Oh, snap.

05:55.168 --> 05:57.092
This is definitely better
than "Paddington."

06:02.776 --> 06:05.376
All I'm saying is that
unions aren't always right,

06:05.378 --> 06:06.752
and corporate isn't always wrong.

06:06.753 --> 06:08.369
That's not what you said
when they made you come back

06:08.370 --> 06:09.848
to work two days after having a baby.

06:09.850 --> 06:11.560
Yeah, you were livin' la vida pissed.

06:11.561 --> 06:13.852
I bet you get maternity
leave now, though.

06:13.854 --> 06:16.328
Oh, yeah, there's a really
great plan for managers.

06:16.329 --> 06:17.388
This isn't about me.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.023
I'm never getting pregnant again, so...

06:19.025 --> 06:21.993
Sure, but other people might
be... wait, never?

06:21.995 --> 06:23.027
- I don't know.
- I mean, I don't know

06:23.029 --> 06:24.529
- where this is going, but...
- I just-I haven't thought about it.

06:24.531 --> 06:26.344
Yeah, I haven't thought about it
either, but it's a conversation

06:26.345 --> 06:29.492
- we should have at some point.
- At some point, Jonah, not this point.

06:30.103 --> 06:32.403
Livin' la vida awkward.

06:32.539 --> 06:35.006
So you thought, "That first one killed."

06:35.008 --> 06:36.327
I'm gonna go back to that well."

06:36.341 --> 06:38.343
I don't understand the
obsession with procreation.

06:38.345 --> 06:40.578
The whole planet's got,
like, maybe ten years left.

06:40.580 --> 06:41.634
Just enjoy it.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.281
Well, I care about maternity leave.

06:43.283 --> 06:45.750
I'm not pregnant,
but I am in a relationship

06:45.752 --> 06:47.886
that's going very well,
and we don't use protection.

06:47.888 --> 06:49.318
Cut the crap, Sandra.

06:49.319 --> 06:50.943
I know you're sleeping with Jerry.

06:51.424 --> 06:52.423
- What?
- Whoa.

06:52.425 --> 06:53.639
- What?
- I... I...

06:53.640 --> 06:54.893
You broke the coin flip?

06:54.895 --> 06:56.361
Why do we even have laws?

06:56.363 --> 06:58.563
I guess Amy's not the only
hypocrite in the room.

06:58.565 --> 06:59.898
Me? Why am I a hypocrite?

06:59.900 --> 07:01.866
Because you're siding with the enemy.

07:01.868 --> 07:03.868
Corporate is not the enemy.

07:03.870 --> 07:07.972
Okay, and where are we
with the union stuff at 1217?

07:07.974 --> 07:09.970
Well, assuming they petition the NLRB,

07:09.971 --> 07:11.241
we'll get legal into it.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.123
Good, keep me in the loop on that.

07:13.124 --> 07:14.655
Keep me in the loop on that too.

07:15.215 --> 07:16.819
Okay, Jeff.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.983
And then it's all about
slowing down their momentum.

07:19.986 --> 07:22.136
We're running background checks
on all the floor workers;

07:22.137 --> 07:24.489
we've authorized ICE to do
a worksite enforcement.

07:24.491 --> 07:26.057
We're trying to isolate the agitators.

07:26.059 --> 07:27.701
ICE? You're bringing in ICE?

07:27.702 --> 07:29.928
Wow, that's, uh, that's extreme.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.729
Yeah, Jeff, that's why we're doing it.

07:31.731 --> 07:32.913
It's extreme.

07:33.296 --> 07:34.403
We're also starting a group

07:34.404 --> 07:36.785
called Working Families
of Cloud 9 that I think...

07:36.786 --> 07:38.339
I have to go to the bathroom.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.058
You can just go.
You don't have to announce it.

07:43.059 --> 07:45.944
Okay, it's diarrhea,

07:45.946 --> 07:48.660
so I'm probably gonna
be gone for a while.

07:51.818 --> 07:53.298
He makes me uncomfortable.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:05.365 --> 08:08.766
I don't understand how
Jerry is the man in the middle.

08:08.768 --> 08:10.068
Am I picturing the right guy?

08:10.070 --> 08:13.471
He's not trying to be sexy,
and that's what makes him sexy.

08:14.607 --> 08:16.607
Jeff again.

08:16.609 --> 08:18.176
It's, like, the fifth time in a row.

08:18.178 --> 08:20.036
I honestly feel like calling someone is

08:20.037 --> 08:21.679
one of the worst things
you can do to them.

08:21.681 --> 08:23.281
I know, right?

08:26.226 --> 08:27.922
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey... oh, Amy.

08:27.936 --> 08:28.842
Thank God.

08:28.843 --> 08:31.293
You know, you don't always have
to use video when you call.

08:31.294 --> 08:34.556
- I like video. Is Mateo working today?
- Yep.

08:34.557 --> 08:37.809
Listen, you have to get him
out of the store right now.

08:38.798 --> 08:41.131
Mateo! Mateo!

08:41.134 --> 08:44.502
ICE is coming!
Isn't it "winter is coming"?

08:44.504 --> 08:45.536
Did you guys see the finale?

08:45.538 --> 08:47.472
Nobody spoil it.
I've never watched the show.

08:47.474 --> 08:50.808
No, I mean ICE, Immigration.
They're coming right now.

08:50.810 --> 08:51.976
- Oh, my God!
- You have to leave.

08:51.978 --> 08:53.044
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, what?

08:53.046 --> 08:54.479
You knew? Why didn't you tell me?

08:54.481 --> 08:56.080
It's not my secret.
It's Mateo's secret.

08:56.082 --> 08:58.103
You told Jonah?
I thought that was between us.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.250
You told Marcus too?

08:59.252 --> 09:01.403
Wait, did you tell him
before you told me?

09:01.404 --> 09:02.854
You shouldn't tell so many people.

09:02.856 --> 09:05.416
Is there anybody else
you didn't tell or just me?

09:05.417 --> 09:06.434
Hey, guys.

09:08.129 --> 09:09.660
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:10.197 --> 09:11.362
I gotta go.

09:14.167 --> 09:17.168
Ooh, do you want your ice cream, Mateo?

09:18.271 --> 09:20.372
Attention Cloud 9 employees:

09:20.374 --> 09:22.274
were you born in a foreign country?

09:22.276 --> 09:23.676
Have you overstayed a visa

09:23.678 --> 09:25.711
or did you cross the border illegally?

09:25.713 --> 09:28.347
Well, today is not your lucky day,

09:28.663 --> 09:29.882
because ICE is here.

09:29.884 --> 09:33.118
So stay tuned, because you can't leave.

09:34.681 --> 09:37.065
I like to add a little color
in the announcements.

09:37.592 --> 09:39.391
Fun for everybody.

09:40.595 --> 09:41.927
There are two guards
on the loading dock.

09:41.929 --> 09:42.995
Yeah, same with the side door.

09:42.997 --> 09:44.496
Oh, God, we're trapped.

09:44.498 --> 09:45.764
Guys, what about this?

09:45.766 --> 09:47.766
You hide in here
with a bunch of mannequins.

09:47.768 --> 09:49.735
Then if ICE looks in, all they see is

09:49.737 --> 09:51.036
a bunch of arms and legs.

09:51.038 --> 09:53.872
That's your brilliant plan,
me hiding in a trash compactor?

09:53.874 --> 09:55.274
What if somebody pushes the button?

09:55.276 --> 09:57.042
Oh, I could tape up a sign that says,

09:57.044 --> 09:59.111
"Please don't operate trash compactor."

09:59.113 --> 10:01.046
No. No, they'd notice that.

10:01.048 --> 10:03.115
It's the fact that
only an idiot would hide

10:03.117 --> 10:05.751
inside a working trash compactor
that plays in our favor.

10:05.753 --> 10:07.252
Maybe we could hide you up on the roof.

10:07.254 --> 10:08.223
And then what?

10:08.270 --> 10:10.723
Well, and then, you know... phase two.

10:10.725 --> 10:12.149
Whoa.

10:12.222 --> 10:15.760
Sorry, my fingers are still
greasy from a salami rollup.

10:16.223 --> 10:18.797
Don't worry.
I'll reset this, you'll get in.

10:19.171 --> 10:20.899
It's gonna be fine.

10:20.901 --> 10:23.869
Here I have my refugee
identity certificate,

10:23.871 --> 10:26.939
my social security card,
driver's license,

10:26.941 --> 10:29.708
electric bills proving my residence.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.577
That's fine. That's fine.

10:31.579 --> 10:34.913
And here are pictures of me
at the block party

10:34.915 --> 10:36.815
in my mostly white neighborhood.

10:36.817 --> 10:38.917
As you can see, everybody's smiling.

10:38.919 --> 10:40.976
The community is embracing me.

10:41.288 --> 10:43.956
So, uh, what's the process here?

10:44.295 --> 10:46.091
Everyone should just go
about business as usual

10:46.093 --> 10:48.262
while we run the socials
through the database.

10:48.416 --> 10:50.095
If we spot any illegals,
we'll let you know.

10:50.097 --> 10:54.209
Well, I don't think we have
any illegals working here.

10:54.259 --> 10:57.009
Well, you never can tell.
They look just like you and me.

10:57.605 --> 10:59.471
Well, you.

11:00.808 --> 11:01.952
Ha-ha.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.477
- What happened?
- They're going through payroll now.

11:05.479 --> 11:06.912
I don't know how long it's gonna take,

11:06.914 --> 11:08.248
but we have to get Mateo out now.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.683
Not sure how happy corporate's
gonna be about you doing that.

11:10.685 --> 11:12.584
Well, [bleep] corporate. I'm done.

11:12.586 --> 11:13.852
Welcome back.

11:20.628 --> 11:22.194
Obviously, we're not gonna
just let them take Mateo,

11:22.196 --> 11:23.762
so somebody come up with something.

11:23.764 --> 11:24.987
There are no bad ideas.

11:24.989 --> 11:26.799
- What about if we get...
- Okay, Sandra.

11:26.801 --> 11:28.869
Could you just stop it
with the wigs, please?

11:28.870 --> 11:29.968
- Thank you.
- Okay, guys... guys.

11:29.969 --> 11:31.405
I actually think I have something here.

11:31.499 --> 11:33.465
"In the event of an ICE
enforcement action,

11:33.466 --> 11:36.200
anyone who may be in violation
of U.S. immigration law

11:36.201 --> 11:37.751
should immediately present themselves

11:37.752 --> 11:39.338
to an officer for evaluation."

11:39.339 --> 11:41.026
This is from ICE.gov.

11:41.275 --> 11:42.786
Super helpful.

11:42.787 --> 11:44.565
Screw it. You can live with me.

11:45.325 --> 11:47.607
I've been living in a
small utility room

11:47.608 --> 11:49.080
in the back of the store
for several months.

11:49.081 --> 11:49.905
What?

11:49.906 --> 11:52.458
I bathe at night in the
employee bathroom,

11:52.459 --> 11:55.057
- and I pee in jars.
- Ew.

11:55.058 --> 11:56.841
Why wouldn't you just pee in
the bathroom?

11:56.842 --> 12:00.759
'Cause I've been peeing in jars.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.666
I would love to not spend
the rest of my life

12:02.667 --> 12:04.698
living with you in a hole
in the back of the store,

12:04.699 --> 12:05.742
but thank you.

12:05.743 --> 12:06.610
You're welcome.

12:06.611 --> 12:08.625
Okay, hiding Mateo
in the store won't work anyway.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.670
They have sniffer dogs,
infrared scanners.

12:10.671 --> 12:12.776
They bust through
windows, kick down doors,

12:12.777 --> 12:14.294
come down through the ceiling...

12:14.295 --> 12:15.521
I mean, it's weird.

12:15.522 --> 12:18.349
Their entire job is just an
exercise in walls being useless.

12:18.350 --> 12:19.963
Okay, so what are you suggesting, Dina?

12:19.964 --> 12:21.827
That we just hand Mateo over to ICE?

12:21.828 --> 12:25.456
I mean, no offense to Mateo, but
technically, he did commit a crime.

12:26.569 --> 12:29.203
I'm just saying, if you get
caught sneaking into a movie,

12:29.204 --> 12:31.014
they don't let you stay
for the rest of the movie.

12:31.015 --> 12:32.485
It depends how much
of the movie you've watched.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.094
Yeah, and what the movie is.

12:34.095 --> 12:35.600
It's the greatest movie
you'll ever see.

12:35.601 --> 12:36.546
It's called America.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.629
Oh, "Ride Along 2" is
in my top ten, easy.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.645
What if your parents
brought you to the movie

12:40.646 --> 12:41.980
through no fault of your own?

12:41.981 --> 12:43.502
Well, you'd still get kicked out.

12:43.503 --> 12:46.143
I mean, yeah. Okay.

12:46.144 --> 12:48.269
What if you were born
in the movie theater?

12:48.270 --> 12:49.737
All right, why don't we take
a break from this metaphor?

12:49.738 --> 12:50.442
Yes, please.

12:50.443 --> 12:51.854
Guys, let's not forget that

12:51.855 --> 12:54.353
Jesus was an immigrant from heaven.

12:54.354 --> 12:55.363
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

12:55.364 --> 12:58.654
And he had to go home too,
and it was not a fun trip.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.304
Plus, it could not have been
easy being a white guy

13:01.305 --> 13:02.821
in the Middle East.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.169
What if we let you get
deported and then you can just

13:05.170 --> 13:06.792
come back legally like Sayid?

13:06.793 --> 13:08.363
Yeah, what was that
application process like?

13:08.364 --> 13:10.299
Well, my country was in a civil war.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.345
I applied for refugee status
and waited two years

13:13.346 --> 13:15.502
for background checks
while all my friends

13:15.503 --> 13:17.280
either died or fled persecution.

13:17.281 --> 13:19.699
Sorry, I meant literally
what was the application like?

13:19.700 --> 13:22.062
Did you do it online or was it
a snail mail situation?

13:22.150 --> 13:24.011
- Snail mail.
- Oof, brutal.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.042
I know.

13:25.043 --> 13:27.505
We can paint your vest
the same color as your sweater,

13:27.506 --> 13:29.232
so it'd make you look like
you're a customer.

13:29.233 --> 13:31.230
Oh, we could just take off his vest.

13:31.231 --> 13:32.873
That's basically what I just pitched.

13:32.874 --> 13:34.013
Guys, that wouldn't work.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.456
They're checking all the
customers' IDs before they leave.

13:36.457 --> 13:38.148
I mean, if the store was more crowded,

13:38.149 --> 13:39.565
we could try and slip him out,

13:39.566 --> 13:41.694
but there are, like,
six customers here today.

13:42.425 --> 13:44.637
Wait, what if we made it more crowded?

13:44.851 --> 13:47.096
Just, like, pack the store with
people and then slipped him out.

13:47.097 --> 13:48.479
You know what, if we hit
up everyone we know,

13:48.480 --> 13:49.835
we could fill up the
store pretty quick.

13:49.837 --> 13:51.417
Some of those people could
wear wigs if they wanted to.

13:51.418 --> 13:52.532
Sandra!

13:52.533 --> 13:54.499
Okay, well, this is
the best plan we've got.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.925
So everybody call everyone
they've ever known.

13:56.926 --> 13:59.638
Friends, family, whoever,
just get them here ASAP.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.416
Actually, most of my friends
live in Manhattan,

14:02.417 --> 14:04.021
so I don't think they'll
make it on time.

14:04.022 --> 14:04.774
Yeah, okay. That's fine.

14:04.775 --> 14:07.000
They're in fashion.
Mostly, they work in fashion.

14:07.001 --> 14:09.457
Guys, "ICE" on three. One, two...

14:09.458 --> 14:10.981
Why would we cheer for ICE?

14:10.982 --> 14:12.072
I don't know, guys.

14:12.073 --> 14:14.155
I'm sick of always
having to be the fun one.

14:14.156 --> 14:15.789
Let's just... let's do this.

14:17.168 --> 14:19.936
Wow, when everyone calls their
friends, this place really fills up.

14:19.938 --> 14:21.938
Yeah, I called Jerusha, but she's busy.

14:21.940 --> 14:25.609
She's doing a fundraiser to buy
Pastor Craig a second airplane.

14:25.611 --> 14:29.005
Ugh, I wish all my friends
didn't live in Manhattan.

14:31.578 --> 14:33.784
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

14:34.092 --> 14:36.052
I'm always gonna be here for you.

14:36.582 --> 14:38.622
- You're the best.
- You're the best.

14:38.997 --> 14:41.024
No, you're the best.

14:41.728 --> 14:44.320
I hate to say this because
they're close friends of mine,

14:44.321 --> 14:47.765
but they're both human traffickers.

14:47.767 --> 14:50.005
If you check her locker,
there's evidence.

14:51.415 --> 14:53.265
Okay, we have to spread out the chaos.

14:53.266 --> 14:55.537
Heather, if you could grab
all of your basketball friends

14:55.538 --> 14:57.876
and go block the guy in pharmacy.

14:57.878 --> 15:00.128
And, um... oh, Marcus.
Take all your friends...

15:00.129 --> 15:01.252
My bro squad.

15:01.253 --> 15:03.456
Yeah, whatever, and go swarm bedding.

15:03.456 --> 15:04.537
Bro out.

15:04.538 --> 15:07.592
And... oh, Kelly. You... Kelly!

15:07.593 --> 15:08.662
What are you doing here?

15:08.663 --> 15:10.047
- Oh, Jonah called me.
- Oh.

15:10.624 --> 15:11.659
We said to call everyone.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.753
I brought a bunch of people
from the Fenton store.

15:13.754 --> 15:15.253
Oh, great. Awesome.

15:15.357 --> 15:16.297
Good.

15:16.338 --> 15:19.635
Uh, I just... I guess I didn't realize
you two were still in touch.

15:19.636 --> 15:21.419
I mean, you know, we check in.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.793
- We do too.
- No, we don't.

15:22.794 --> 15:24.143
'Cause I don't have your number.

15:24.144 --> 15:25.714
Okay, great. Cool, very cool.

15:25.715 --> 15:26.930
Glad to have you on the team.

15:26.931 --> 15:28.677
If you could just grab all your...

15:29.237 --> 15:31.877
so were these, like,
texts or phone calls?

15:31.878 --> 15:33.381
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

15:33.382 --> 15:34.833
Whoa.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.060
Nice piece, dog.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.649
What is it, like a Cougar Magnum?

15:37.651 --> 15:39.443
- It's a Glock.
- Oh, nice.

15:39.444 --> 15:41.905
Very nice. Could I try shooting that?

15:41.906 --> 15:43.969
My gun? No.

15:43.970 --> 15:45.650
Mm-mm. Oh, watch out!

15:45.651 --> 15:47.925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoop, whoop, whoop!

15:47.926 --> 15:50.653
We didn't have any that said
"Make America Great Again."

15:50.654 --> 15:52.595
The closest I could find was
"Fart Police."

15:52.596 --> 15:54.592
Ugh, I'm just gonna wear this one.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.208
How do I look?

15:57.209 --> 15:58.239
Great.

15:58.972 --> 16:00.504
I'm gonna miss working with you.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.288
Chey, relax. I'm gonna get out.

16:03.289 --> 16:07.350
Yeah, but even if you do make it out,
you can't come back now that they know.

16:08.288 --> 16:12.431
Oh. Uh... yeah, of course.

16:12.932 --> 16:16.604
Obviously... that would be the case.

16:26.932 --> 16:28.833
And then at one pageant,

16:28.835 --> 16:31.803
we heard this girl
gagging in the bathroom.

16:31.805 --> 16:35.006
And we're all like, "Guess we
know how" she stays so slim."

16:35.008 --> 16:38.353
Turns out, an actual strangler
had broken into the building

16:38.354 --> 16:40.509
and was straight up
trying to murder her.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.225
Well, she managed to fight him off

16:43.226 --> 16:45.855
with a hot curling iron
and an eyebrow pencil.

16:46.949 --> 16:48.264
She came in second.

16:48.722 --> 16:49.988
So, the guy we're looking for is named

16:49.989 --> 16:52.932
Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag.

16:53.426 --> 16:56.267
- Liwanag?
- Yeah, it sounds Swedish.

16:56.268 --> 16:57.762
Or Latvian.

16:57.764 --> 17:00.864
- Mateo could be Mexican.
- Hey, you know what?

17:00.865 --> 17:04.069
There is a guy here named Mark.
Maybe you're looking for him.

17:04.069 --> 17:05.336
No, it's not Mark.

17:05.338 --> 17:08.499
It's Mateo, and it says that he
has worked here for four years.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.579
Well, I'm sorry.
I know everyone who has

17:11.580 --> 17:14.311
ever worked here, and I have
never heard that name.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.034
Okay.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.272
Thanks.

17:20.819 --> 17:22.797
So, who's this?

17:24.731 --> 17:25.991
What the hell?

17:26.326 --> 17:30.757
Um, that... I... have never
seen that picture before.

17:31.525 --> 17:33.242
Feels like I'm in a horror movie.

17:33.733 --> 17:35.877
Okay, just act natural.

17:35.878 --> 17:37.767
I'm trying to,
but I forgot how to walk.

17:37.768 --> 17:39.680
Oh, and now I forget.

17:40.406 --> 17:41.766
- I think we're doing it right.
- Okay.

17:41.767 --> 17:42.727
You're doing it.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.927
There you are!

17:43.929 --> 17:45.211
- They know about you.
- Both: What?

17:45.212 --> 17:46.541
They saw your picture.
They know what you look like.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.179
- We have to go now.
- Okay, well, where do we go?

17:48.181 --> 17:50.013
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:50.014 --> 17:51.450
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

17:51.451 --> 17:54.374
- I'll get you out of there.
- Uh... repeat.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.378
You've got agents coming your way
from menswear and electronics.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.806
Make a left at aisle nine, and
we'll lose them in grocery.

17:58.807 --> 18:00.672
- Thank you, Dina.
- Go, now!

18:00.673 --> 18:02.649
You ever find yourself in a situation

18:02.650 --> 18:04.837
where you're dating a girl
and you realize she's, like,

18:04.838 --> 18:06.053
an immigrant or whatever,

18:06.054 --> 18:09.027
and you gotta choose between
your love and your country?

18:10.284 --> 18:12.284
- Hasn't come up.
- Ah.

18:12.418 --> 18:14.579
You'd choose love, though.
Yeah, I can tell.

18:14.580 --> 18:15.916
I know your type.

18:19.323 --> 18:20.812
- Okay, keep walking.
- Come on.

18:20.814 --> 18:22.447
All right, when you hit
the end of the aisle,

18:22.449 --> 18:23.449
you're gonna need to head due west.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.203
- Where?
- Left or right, Dina?

18:25.204 --> 18:27.161
Left! Due west runs
diagonally through the store

18:27.162 --> 18:28.316
from camping to customer service.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.454
How do you not know that?

18:29.455 --> 18:30.938
- Left.
- Okay.

18:34.303 --> 18:35.209
- Oh.
- Hey!

18:35.209 --> 18:36.805
- Oh!
- Oh, [bleep], there's someone.

18:36.806 --> 18:38.296
- Run!
- Come on, come on, come on,

18:38.298 --> 18:39.297
- come on, come on!
- Run!

18:39.299 --> 18:40.298
They're heading north
through housewares.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.734
Get out of there! Go! Go now!

18:42.736 --> 18:44.257
So, everyone knows now?

18:44.258 --> 18:45.786
Everyone knows.

18:46.511 --> 18:48.021
Do you wanna get married?

18:51.126 --> 18:52.298
Okay.

18:54.507 --> 18:57.281
Okay, you guys need to keep going
straight through Bath & Beauty.

18:57.283 --> 18:58.223
And we're gonna try and
make it all the way

18:58.224 --> 18:59.722
to the end of the garden
section, all right?

18:59.723 --> 19:00.802
Go, go, go!

19:03.222 --> 19:04.743
Go, go, go!

19:04.744 --> 19:07.638
Did you know that the capital
of Panama is Panama?

19:07.639 --> 19:10.484
I can rap the entire
Central American countries.

19:10.485 --> 19:12.576
I did it once for a talent competition.

19:12.577 --> 19:14.429
♪ México D.F., México ♪

19:14.430 --> 19:16.441
♪ Guatemala, Guatemala ♪

19:16.442 --> 19:18.045
♪ Tegucigalpa, Honduras ♪

19:18.046 --> 19:19.902
♪ San Salvador, El Salvador ♪

19:19.903 --> 19:21.670
♪ San José, Costa Rica ♪

19:21.671 --> 19:23.585
♪ Panamá, Panamá ♪

19:23.586 --> 19:25.877
- Go!
- This way. Go, go, go!

19:25.879 --> 19:26.853
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No, wait, stop!

19:26.854 --> 19:28.925
Stop! Reverse course, turn around!

19:28.926 --> 19:30.415
Okay, new plan.

19:30.416 --> 19:32.082
Just make it to pharmacy.
You can hide out...

19:32.083 --> 19:33.143
No, no, wait. Turn around.

19:33.144 --> 19:35.246
Turn around, go back.
Go back the other way.

19:35.247 --> 19:36.721
You could lose them
in housewares, I think.

19:36.723 --> 19:37.618
Just book it!

19:37.619 --> 19:38.656
Okay? Book it to the end!

19:38.658 --> 19:39.901
This one. Go down here, down here.

19:39.902 --> 19:41.720
Stop, stop, stop! No, wait, stop!

19:41.721 --> 19:43.209
There's, like, 20 guys coming that way.

19:43.210 --> 19:43.871
What?

19:43.872 --> 19:46.130
No, stop! Stop, stop!

19:46.132 --> 19:47.977
Now there's another one!
There's... hold on!

19:47.978 --> 19:49.878
- Hold on.
- Dina, just tell us where to go.

19:49.879 --> 19:51.166
Okay, hang on. Just wait.

19:51.167 --> 19:55.306
Wait! I don't... I don't know.

19:55.308 --> 19:57.159
They're... they're everywhere.

19:57.160 --> 19:57.811
What?

19:58.759 --> 19:59.940
I'm sorry.

19:59.941 --> 20:01.714
- No!
- It's okay.

20:01.715 --> 20:02.791
Okay, there's a vent up there.

20:02.792 --> 20:04.248
We can climb up on the thing and...

20:04.250 --> 20:07.005
Or we can create a diversion and
take off our tops while you go run.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.743
- Yes, let's do that.
- Guys.

20:08.744 --> 20:10.371
Stop, stop, guys!

20:11.356 --> 20:12.359
It's okay.

20:14.350 --> 20:15.511
It's over.

20:43.319 --> 20:44.696
What do we do now?

20:45.476 --> 20:47.854
I mean, we have to fight this.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.313
How?

20:52.198 --> 20:53.738
No idea.

21:07.247 --> 21:08.794
Wanna start a union?
