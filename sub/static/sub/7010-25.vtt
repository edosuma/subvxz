12:09.562 --> 12:12.647
I'M RUNNING A DOJO
OF COOLNESS.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.525
JACKIE, DEMONSTRATE.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.027
[MOUTH FULL]
OOGLY MOOGLY.

12:18.195 --> 12:21.281
GOOGLY. HAH! HA!

12:24.452 --> 12:27.120
YEAH, IT'S HER FIRST DAY.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.464
KITTY, I DON'T
WANT OUR DAUGHTER

12:37.631 --> 12:40.884
DATING
THAT KETTLEHEAD.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.928
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S JUST A PHASE.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.889
NO.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.891
HE'S BEEN
A KETTLEHEAD SINCE...

12:48.058 --> 12:50.852
NO. NO. I MEANT LAURIE.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.480
THIS IS HOW IT STARTS,
YOU KNOW.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.940
FIRST THEY'RE DATING
AND HAVING FUN.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.984
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

12:58.152 --> 13:00.403
THEY'RE PRYIN' THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR A WEDDING

13:00.571 --> 13:04.324
FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.202
OH, HONEY, THEY'RE
NOT GONNA GET MARRIED.

13:07.369 --> 13:10.789
HE'LL LEAVE HER WHEN SHE
GETS PREGNANT. HA HA HA!

13:11.415 --> 13:14.042
HA HA HA HA HA!

13:14.210 --> 13:16.377
HA HA HA HA...

13:16.545 --> 13:18.338
OH. OKAY.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.550
I SEE MR. SMILEY
ISN'T IN TOWN TODAY.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.637
I EXPECTED MORE FROM HER.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.807
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING
WITH SOME HIGH SCHOOL KID?

13:28.974 --> 13:30.517
SHE WENT TO COLLEGE!

13:30.684 --> 13:32.769
WELL, SHE DID FLUNK OUT.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.395
[SIGHS]

13:34.563 --> 13:36.356
OH, KITTY...

13:36.524 --> 13:38.983
I CAN SEE HOW THEIR FUTURE
IS GONNA TURN OUT...

13:39.151 --> 13:42.987
AND IT'S NOT GOOD.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.169
[ROBOT VOICE]
MORE MASHED
POTATOES, RED?

13:58.337 --> 14:01.673
WHY, THANK YOU,
SERVOTRON 2000.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.344
OH, IT'S COLD.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.639
DAMN FOREIGN ROBOTS.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.852
OH, IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE DINNER
WITH THE FAMILY LIKE THIS.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.396
YEAH. IT'S A GOOD THING WE
FOUND A BABY-SITTING DROID

14:16.564 --> 14:18.898
FOR THE QUINTUPLETS.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.527
SO, MICHAEL, HOW'S
THE JOB HUNT GOING?

14:24.196 --> 14:26.406
GREAT! THEY HAD A
REAL SHORT LINE AT

14:26.574 --> 14:28.658
THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE, SO
I GOT HOME IN TIME TO CATCH

14:28.826 --> 14:32.370
THE END OF THE SPACE
PRICE IS RIGHT.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.040
YOU KNOW, TIMES ARE TOUGH
FOR ME AND KELSO RIGHT NOW.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.127
YOU'LL HELP US,
WON'T YOU, DADDY?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.964
I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE
FOR YOU, HONEY.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.426
I THINK SHE MEANS
FINANCIALLY, RED.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.053
I KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS...

14:49.221 --> 14:52.098
[MUTTERING] KETTLEHEAD.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.644
YOU'RE... GIVIN' US MORE
MONEY... RIGHT, DUDE?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.438
YES, DAMN IT!

14:58.606 --> 15:00.189
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.151
HEY, LAURIE... I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR OUR... NAP.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.195
ALL RIGHT!
THAT'S IT!

15:06.363 --> 15:09.240
I'VE GOTTA GO TO SATURN
ON BUSINESS FOR A WEEK.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.951
AND WHEN I GET BACK,
YOU'D BETTER HAVE A JOB,

15:12.119 --> 15:15.955
OR IT'S OFF TO THE ASTEROID
MINES FOR YOU!

15:18.918 --> 15:21.794
DON'T FORGET
YOUR BRIEFCASE, RED.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.590
THANK YOU,

15:28.218 --> 15:31.012
ROLL BACK THE ROOF,
'CAUSE I GOTTA GO.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.974
JETPACK...
BLAST OFF!

15:44.318 --> 15:46.319
K¡tty: RED.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.112
RED.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.031
AHEM. THAT'S IT.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.867
I'M JUST GONNA TELL HER THAT
SHE CAN'T SEE HIM ANYMORE.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.494
NOPE, NOPE. YOU CAN'T
DO THAT, RED.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.954
IN FACT, THE MORE
WE FIGHT IT,

15:56.121 --> 15:59.123
THE MORE SHE'S GONNA WANT
TO BE WITH... KETTLEHEAD.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.670
AHH, AT THIS RATE, I'M
GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK

16:03.837 --> 16:06.839
BEFORE I EVEN GET
MY JETPACK.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.844
YOU KNOW...
I MISSED YOU GUYS.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.181
YEAH. THIS PLACE JUST ISN'T
THE SAME WHEN I'M NOT AROUND.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.978
OH, HEY. YOU GUYS WANT TO
HEAR A REALLY FUNNY STORY?

16:20.145 --> 16:23.439
I WAS JUST UPSTAIRS, AND RED
WAS YELLING AT ME ABOUT YOU.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.192
AND, UH,
THEN I SAID,

16:26.360 --> 16:27.777
"WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'
YELLIN' AT ME?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.195
KELSO'S RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.948
IN FACT, I'LL GO GET
HIM FOR YOU," I SAID.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.785
SAY, THAT IS
A FUNNY STORY.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.789
I DON'T CARE.
I'LL TALK TO RED.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.960
HE WAS REALLY MEAN TO ME, AND
HERE I BROUGHT HIM A 5-PACK.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.005
SO I HOPE HE'S
READY TO APOLOGIZE.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.298
HA HA HA
HA HA!

16:49.466 --> 16:51.300
OH, YEAH!

16:51.468 --> 16:52.927
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
IF THERE'S ONE THING

16:53.095 --> 16:55.763
RED'S ABOUT,
IT'S FORGIVENESS.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.599
NO, HE'S NOT.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.269
HE'S THE OPPOSITE
OF THAT.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.983
OH, WAIT.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.735
I GET YOU.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.319
FUNNY.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.114
[CHUCKLES]

17:24.501 --> 17:26.127
WAIT. UH... [CHUCKLES]

17:26.295 --> 17:28.671
RED, CAN'T WE, UH,
L-LEAVE THAT OPEN?

17:28.839 --> 17:31.424
HAVE A SEAT, KELSO.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.384
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING

17:33.552 --> 17:35.553
A LOT ABOUT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

17:35.721 --> 17:37.972
WITH MY ONLY DAUGHTER.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.308
SHE'S A GEM.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.518
SHUT UP.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.063
KITTY SAYS THAT IF THE TWO OF
YOU WANT TO SEE EACH OTHER,

17:45.230 --> 17:47.607
THERE'S... NOTHIN'
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

17:47.775 --> 17:51.069
BUT SHE'S WRONG...
'CAUSE I COULD KILL YOU.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.283
THAT'S A JOKE, KELSO.
YOU SHOULD LAUGH

17:57.451 --> 17:59.118
WHEN I MAKE A JOKE.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.579
[WEAKLY]
HA HA HA. HEY,
GOOD ONE, RED.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.581
SEE, YOU'RE MAKING ME
THINK THAT I SHOULD TAKE

18:03.749 --> 18:05.374
A PERSONAL INTEREST IN YOU,

18:05.542 --> 18:08.211
AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT.
TAKE ERIC, FOR EXAMPLE.

18:08.378 --> 18:11.172
I HAVE A PERSONAL
INTEREST IN HIM.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.091
OH, GOD.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.467
THERE YOU GO.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.885
WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO HERE

18:16.053 --> 18:17.637
IS FLY IN
UNDER MY RADAR

18:17.805 --> 18:21.015
SO THAT IF I NEVER SEE
YOU AND LAURIE TOGETHER

18:21.183 --> 18:23.184
OR HEAR YOUR NAME MENTIONED
IN THE SAME BREATH,

18:23.352 --> 18:27.897
I MIGHT JUST... FORGET THAT YOU
EVEN EXIST. GOT IT?

18:28.065 --> 18:30.733
YEAH. OKAY, SO YOU MEAN
IF... IF ME AND LAURIE...

18:30.901 --> 18:35.571
OH, NOW, SEE... YOU JUST

18:35.739 --> 18:37.156
I'M SORRY.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.033
OKAY. UM...

18:39.201 --> 18:41.202

18:43.956 --> 18:46.082
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK, EITHER.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.417
WELL, TH-THIS
IS HARD, RED!

18:48.585 --> 18:50.169
YEAH. WELL, YOU'RE

18:50.337 --> 18:51.754
GET IT RIGHT, KELSO.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.965
WELL, OKAY, RED, BUT
EVENTUALLY MY PARENTS

18:54.133 --> 18:56.592
ARE GONNA COME
LOOKIN' FOR ME.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.095
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
NOT GONNA FIND YOU.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.097
[BREATH TREMBLES]

19:01.265 --> 19:03.558
OH, THAT'S ANOTHER JOKE.
COME ON, LAUGH, KELSO!

19:03.725 --> 19:06.310

HALF-LAUGHING]

19:18.407 --> 19:20.032
OH, YOU AGAIN.

19:20.200 --> 19:24.537
WHAT HAPPENED? DID THEY LET
OUT KINDERGARTEN EARLY TODAY?

19:24.705 --> 19:27.999
WHATEVER.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.043
JACKIE, DON'T YOU
HAVE A LAME COMEBACK

19:31.211 --> 19:33.337
SAVED FOR JUST
THIS VERY OCCASION?

19:33.505 --> 19:36.924
THAT'S COOL.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.636
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE
LITTLE MISS COOL, HUH?

19:40.804 --> 19:43.264
WHATEVER.

19:43.432 --> 19:47.101
WELL. IF YOU'RE REALLY AS
COOL AS YOU THINK YOU ARE,

19:47.269 --> 19:50.730
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD
ONTO YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.107
BUT YOU COULDN'T,
COULD YOU?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.193
LOSER!

POUR WATER ON THEM,

20:26.308 --> 20:28.184
AND THEN WE CAN SEE
THROUGH THEIR SHIRTS!

20:28.352 --> 20:30.436
OHHH!

20:52.292 --> 20:53.584
OH.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.628
I CAN'T BELIEVE
LAURIE BIT ME.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.589
I HOPE SHE DIDN'T GIVE
ME, LIKE, SLUT RABIES.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.134
JACKIE...

21:02.302 --> 21:04.595
YOU'RE MY HERO.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.265
YOU HIT HER IN THE EYE.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.016
YEAH, BUT I GUESS

21:09.184 --> 21:10.434
IT WASN'T VERY ZEN
OF ME, WAS IT, HYDE?

21:10.602 --> 21:12.561
WELL...
WHERE ZEN ENDS...

21:12.729 --> 21:16.607
ASS-KICKING BEGINS.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.443
AND THAT'S YOUR FINAL LESSON,
GRASSHOPPER.

LET'S DO THAT THING

21:24.658 --> 21:28.452
WHERE WE ALL SIT
IN THE CIRCLE AGAIN.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.455
OH, ONE STEP
AHEAD OF YA.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.211
THE FACT THAT YOU
ACTUALLY WENT

21:37.379 --> 21:39.714
INTO THE GARAGE WITH RED...
THAT'S SO BRAVE.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.966
YEAH.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.429
I GUESS WE BOTH HAD TO
FIGHT FOR OUR LOVE, BABY.
