00:55.438 --> 00:57.429
MAN: Two men standing
at the Pearly Gates.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.101
[pained breaths]

00:59.109 --> 01:03.398
The first man says,
"How'd you die?"

01:03.405 --> 01:06.488
Second says,
"I froze to death.

01:06.491 --> 01:08.607
How 'bout you?"

01:08.618 --> 01:10.734
And the, uh, second man says,

01:10.745 --> 01:15.114
"Well, I thought my... my wife
was being unfaithful to me,

01:15.125 --> 01:17.912
...so I ran all the way home."
- Come on.

01:17.919 --> 01:18.954
[winces]

01:18.962 --> 01:20.543
"And burst into the bedroom."

01:20.547 --> 01:21.582
MAN [far off]:
There's nothin' here.

01:21.590 --> 01:22.625
- "She just..."
- Look over there.

01:22.632 --> 01:23.621
Yes, sir.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.589
Make sure there's men on...

01:25.594 --> 01:27.175
Here!

01:27.178 --> 01:28.634
We're here!

01:34.644 --> 01:35.804
You take him first.

01:35.812 --> 01:37.097
But, captain, he's as good as...

01:37.105 --> 01:38.470
That's an order.

01:38.481 --> 01:39.641
[distant]
Sergeant.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.354
[distant]
Hey, watch it. Careful. Corporal!

01:44.362 --> 01:46.694
Watch his leg.

01:46.698 --> 01:48.689
[groaning]

02:04.049 --> 02:06.040
[fireworks exploding]

02:09.888 --> 02:11.879
[dancehall band playing]

02:19.356 --> 02:25.727
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

02:25.737 --> 02:28.695
Victory!

02:29.950 --> 02:31.690
[laughs]

02:32.118 --> 02:34.359
Getting a little ahead of ourselves,
don't you think?

02:34.371 --> 02:37.534
Will, Lee surrendered to Grant,
so have a drink.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.531
- Freddie, have you seen him yet?
- A dozen rebel armies still in the field.

02:39.542 --> 02:40.998
I'd say peace is far from in hand.

02:41.002 --> 02:42.867
Hamilton, you could put frost on a fire.

02:42.879 --> 02:46.042
No, I haven't, but half his cabinet's here.
There's Interior...

02:46.049 --> 02:48.005
and Postmaster.

02:49.219 --> 02:50.550
- Treasury.
- Mm-hmm.

02:50.553 --> 02:51.884
Secretary of Navy.

02:51.888 --> 02:53.594
Where's War?

02:53.598 --> 02:55.054
Ooh, there he is.

02:55.725 --> 02:58.307
God, what I would give to meet him.

02:58.937 --> 03:01.019
What? Wait.
Where are you going?

03:01.731 --> 03:03.187
You coming or not?

03:03.191 --> 03:04.727
Are you... Are you mad?

03:04.734 --> 03:06.975
You can't approach Edwin Stanton
without an introduction.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.227
Really?

03:09.739 --> 03:11.070
- Frederick Aiken.
- Oh.

03:11.074 --> 03:13.611
I've been to Creation and back
lookin' for you.

03:13.618 --> 03:15.779
Senator.
Uh, Baker, Hamilton,

03:15.787 --> 03:19.200
allow me to introduce the distinguished
senator from Maryland,

03:19.207 --> 03:21.539
- Mr. Reverdy Johnson.
- Great honor, senator.

03:21.543 --> 03:23.784
Gentlemen, you've done this nation proud.

03:23.795 --> 03:25.126
Thank you, sir.

03:25.130 --> 03:30.341
Ladies. Ladies, may I present
two genuine war heroes.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.583
Now you all get acquainted

03:31.594 --> 03:34.006
while I introduce the counselor
to some of my,

03:34.014 --> 03:35.720
uh, esteemed associates.

03:35.724 --> 03:36.759
- Ladies.
- Hello.

03:36.766 --> 03:37.972
It's, uh, quite a turnout.

03:37.976 --> 03:39.967
- Hello.
- It's an honor to meet the lovely...

03:39.978 --> 03:41.684
Victory is like shit to flies, Freddie.

03:42.272 --> 03:44.809
Why, Ed, what a delightful surprise.

03:44.816 --> 03:47.603
Life's full of them, Reverdy.
[chuckles]

03:47.610 --> 03:50.272
This is our War secretary,
Mr. Edwin Stanton.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.397
Yeah. It's a... it's a very great
pleasure, sir.

03:53.408 --> 03:55.990
Mr. Aiken had two horses
shot from under him

03:55.994 --> 03:57.404
and never quit the field.

03:59.831 --> 04:03.449
Could use a loyal man like you
over at the War Department, Captain.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.495
Sir.

04:04.502 --> 04:06.413
Captain's back to bein' a lawyer.

04:06.421 --> 04:09.458
Time to heal the nation, Ed,
not wage more war.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.086
Pleasure as always, Senator.

04:12.093 --> 04:14.630
- Captain.
- Sir.

04:14.637 --> 04:17.470
I'm sorry you won't be able to meet
the president this evening.

04:17.474 --> 04:18.714
Will he not be attending?

04:18.725 --> 04:21.011
It seems Mrs. Lincoln
prefers an evening of theater

04:21.019 --> 04:23.431
to a room full of soldiers.

04:26.858 --> 04:28.849
BAKER: Anything.
I can play anything.

04:28.860 --> 04:29.895
<i>Poor Blind Boy?</i>

04:29.903 --> 04:31.268
I don't know that one.
Uh, anything...

04:31.279 --> 04:32.314
Oh, thank you, Nicholas.

04:32.322 --> 04:35.985
Sarah... oh, my God.
You look beautiful.

04:35.992 --> 04:37.528
Sarah, glad to see you.

04:37.535 --> 04:39.651
Fred didn't mention you'd be
joining us this evening.

04:39.662 --> 04:42.074
- That sounds like Fred.
- What sounds like Fred?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.663
Nothing you need to worry about.

04:43.666 --> 04:44.655
[chuckles]

04:44.834 --> 04:46.540
How many bottles is that now, Nick?

04:46.544 --> 04:49.286
Uh, nothing you need
to worry about, Fred.

04:49.297 --> 04:50.707
Shall we take a stroll?

04:50.715 --> 04:51.875
Mm-hmm.

04:51.883 --> 04:53.999
It's good to have you boys back.

04:54.010 --> 04:55.500
It's good to be back.

04:58.139 --> 05:00.505
[glasses clink]
It's very good to be back.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.974
[horse approaches]

05:02.977 --> 05:05.514
[horse snorts]

05:05.522 --> 05:08.355
[audience laughing inside]

05:08.358 --> 05:10.940
ACTRESS: Oh, quite right.

05:10.944 --> 05:15.278
ACTOR: Some gals and their mothers
would look...

05:27.377 --> 05:29.368
[overlapping conversations]

05:33.216 --> 05:34.547
MAN: Mr. Vice President.

05:34.551 --> 05:35.540
ANDREW JOHNSON:
Yes, Senator?

05:35.552 --> 05:38.669
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,
but I need your authorization on this.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.841
Is it really necessary right now?
I have so many guests.

05:40.849 --> 05:42.055
I'm afraid it's relatively urgent.

05:42.058 --> 05:45.516
ACTOR: You have to keep the sun
out of your eyes,

05:45.520 --> 05:47.556
look straight, pull strong,

05:47.564 --> 05:48.599
calculate the distance,

05:48.606 --> 05:50.813
and you'll hit the mark every time.

05:55.405 --> 05:57.566
[raps on door]

06:00.201 --> 06:02.157
- What?
- Not sure.

06:05.248 --> 06:06.283
Sir?

06:06.291 --> 06:08.452
Yes, I have a package
for Secretary Seward.

06:08.459 --> 06:11.747
We are old friends, Mr. Trenchard,

06:11.754 --> 06:13.836
and you needn't be afraid of us.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.250
I ain't afraid of you,

06:15.258 --> 06:17.590
both of you together.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.926
[laughter]

06:36.946 --> 06:37.935
BARTENDER:
Want another?

06:39.574 --> 06:40.609
Sir?

06:42.327 --> 06:43.442
[clears throat]

06:49.167 --> 06:52.876
Secretary Stanton
is a smart man.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.621
The War Department
would be lucky to have you.

06:55.632 --> 06:59.341
It was an honor to meet the man, but...

06:59.344 --> 07:02.051
I'm eager to put the war behind me.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.092
You do look awfully handsome
in your uniform.

07:08.102 --> 07:09.808
Oh?

07:10.980 --> 07:13.392
I suppose I'm going
to have to get used to you

07:13.399 --> 07:14.559
in civilian clothing again.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.602
So you did miss me?

07:19.989 --> 07:21.650
On occasion.

07:27.205 --> 07:28.991
[laughter]

07:28.998 --> 07:30.954
ACTOR: Now I've no fortune,

07:30.959 --> 07:33.291
but I am filled over with affection

07:33.294 --> 07:35.956
that I am ready to pour over you

07:35.964 --> 07:39.582
like apple sass over roasted pork.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.628
- [laughter]
- ACTRESS: Mr. Trenchard!

07:41.636 --> 07:45.470
You are addressing my daughter,
and in my presence!

07:45.473 --> 07:50.137
ACTOR: Yes! I'm offering her my heart
and my hand just as she wants them,

07:50.144 --> 07:51.509
with nothing in 'em.

07:51.521 --> 07:52.977
[laughter]

07:52.981 --> 07:55.973
ACTRESS:
Now, I'm aware, Mr. Trenchard,

07:55.984 --> 07:59.192
that you are not used
to the manner of polite...

08:08.705 --> 08:11.071
[coins clink]

08:15.003 --> 08:16.038
Pardon me. I'm sor...

08:16.045 --> 08:17.034
Oh.

08:23.886 --> 08:25.717
- [pistol clicks]
- Shit.

08:31.394 --> 08:32.850
- Oh, no!
- Hold it!

08:35.898 --> 08:37.683
[woman screams]

08:37.692 --> 08:39.557
Stop! No!

08:39.568 --> 08:41.025
No, please! Don't!

08:42.655 --> 08:45.067
Ohh!
Unh!

08:45.074 --> 08:46.860
Help!

08:46.868 --> 08:49.575
Somebody help!

08:52.123 --> 08:54.614
Help!

08:54.625 --> 08:57.492
...to which you have fallen guilty.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.414
[laughter]

09:00.757 --> 09:05.547
Well, I guess I know enough
to turn you inside out, old gal,

09:05.553 --> 09:08.761
you sock dologizing old man-trap...

09:08.765 --> 09:10.301

Ohh!

09:57.814 --> 09:58.803
Lincoln's been shot.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.146

- He's been shot.

10:00.149 --> 10:01.685

12:24.585 --> 12:26.951
[woman weeping]

12:37.098 --> 12:40.090
Mr. Secretary, it was the actor,
John Wilkes Booth.

12:40.935 --> 12:42.675
Are you certain?

12:42.687 --> 12:44.427
They've performed with him many times.
They're positive.

12:47.275 --> 12:49.766
We haven't done anything wrong.
It's gonna be all right.

12:50.278 --> 12:54.692
Well, one man did not orchestrate
all of this on his own.

12:54.699 --> 12:55.734
Where's Grant?

12:55.741 --> 12:57.026
He's on a train to Philadelphia.

Bring him to me.

13:01.872 --> 13:03.783
Put the forts on alert, all guns manned.

13:03.791 --> 13:06.783
And find out which members of the Cabinet
are still unaccounted for.

13:06.794 --> 13:10.002
Sir, we should move to the War Department
to facilitate operations.

- I'm not leaving him.
- Yes, sir.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.626

13:21.475 --> 13:22.590
Mr. Secretary, sir.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.308
Several names have come up, sir,

including an intimate of Booth's,

13:25.730 --> 13:26.765
a John Surratt.

What is known of him?

13:28.149 --> 13:29.559

Find him.

13:32.737 --> 13:34.227
I want the city closed.

13:34.238 --> 13:35.569
If any of these assassins

13:35.573 --> 13:37.359
get south of the Potomac
or up into Canada,

13:37.366 --> 13:38.526
they will never be found.

13:38.534 --> 13:39.819
Right away, sir.

13:39.827 --> 13:41.943
Also the vice president wishes
to pay his respects.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.696
When I say it is safe
for him to do so.

13:44.707 --> 13:46.322
And keep him away
from the liquor.

13:46.334 --> 13:47.369
Yes, sir.

13:48.419 --> 13:49.659
[Mary Lincoln sobbing]

13:49.670 --> 13:52.878
Take that woman out,
and do not let her in again.

14:04.727 --> 14:06.718
[no audible dialogue, music playing]

14:12.360 --> 14:13.691
Let's go.

14:13.694 --> 14:15.776
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.612
[groans]

14:18.616 --> 14:19.651
Move it!

14:20.701 --> 14:21.907
Get up, you!

14:21.911 --> 14:23.321
No! [grunting]

14:52.233 --> 14:54.224
[weapons rattling]

15:00.324 --> 15:01.359
Booth.

15:06.038 --> 15:07.073
[winces]

15:38.154 --> 15:40.736
[coughs]

15:40.740 --> 15:42.446
Yah!

15:52.126 --> 15:54.117
[gasping]

16:21.322 --> 16:23.313
[crowd murmuring]

16:34.668 --> 16:36.909
MAN: That's for the judge to decide.

16:36.921 --> 16:38.661
[knock on door]

16:38.672 --> 16:39.707
Sir.

16:39.715 --> 16:42.331
Well, nice of you
to show, Mr. Aiken.

16:42.343 --> 16:44.334
I'm sorry for being late, Senator.

16:44.345 --> 16:47.712
You aware the trial of the conspirators
begins today?

16:47.723 --> 16:49.679
Yes, sir.
There's not a seat to be had.

16:49.683 --> 16:51.514
Well, now you have one.

16:52.269 --> 16:53.258
How's that, sir?

16:53.646 --> 16:54.852
I've taken one of the cases,

16:54.855 --> 16:57.187
and I want you
to be my second chair.

16:57.191 --> 17:00.183
I thought the government
was planning a military tribunal.

17:00.194 --> 17:01.855
Oh, indeed. Stanton has chosen

17:01.862 --> 17:06.526
nine of his most loyal officers
to be judges, all for Union.

17:06.534 --> 17:09.901
In fact, he's picked one of the Lincoln's
pallbearers to head the Commission.

17:09.912 --> 17:11.196
Uh, let's go.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.536
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.576
I might be being a little slow,

17:14.583 --> 17:16.039
but won't the War Department

17:16.042 --> 17:17.499
be handling the prosecution?

17:17.502 --> 17:20.744
Stanton's most trusted
judge advocate general,

17:20.756 --> 17:22.747
Joseph Holt, will be in charge.

17:22.758 --> 17:24.464
Then what are we to do?

17:24.468 --> 17:26.424
Defend one of the eight.

17:26.428 --> 17:29.716
[scoffs] Defend one
of the assassins?

17:29.723 --> 17:32.430
Alleged assassins, counselor.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.891
I had a letter from the lady this morning.

17:34.895 --> 17:37.102
She runs a boarding house,
a Mrs. Mary...

17:37.106 --> 17:38.141
Surratt?

17:38.148 --> 17:39.228
Yes, that's it.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.224
Sir, her son John was Booth's right hand.

17:42.236 --> 17:45.569
Well, if they suspect her son,
they should try him.

17:45.573 --> 17:47.905
[laughs] They would
if they could find him,

17:47.908 --> 17:50.570
but they've got 250 agents
out looking for him.

17:50.578 --> 17:53.741
She built the nest
that hatched this plot.

17:53.747 --> 17:56.079
President Johnson said it himself.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.916
Well, I know this goes hard
with you, Freddie,

17:58.919 --> 18:00.250
but... but what they're plannin',

18:00.254 --> 18:02.916
which is a military trial of civilians,

18:02.923 --> 18:03.912
is an atrocity.

18:03.924 --> 18:06.085
No, no. What she did is an atrocity.

18:06.093 --> 18:07.424
There's no presumption of innocence,

18:07.428 --> 18:10.386
no burden of proof,
no jury of your peers and no appeal.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.755
All right, you were one
of Lincoln's pallbearers, too.

18:12.766 --> 18:14.427
How can you represent her?

18:14.435 --> 18:16.972
She's entitled to a defense, Freddie,

18:16.979 --> 18:18.640
so I shall defend her.

18:57.811 --> 18:59.972
Mary E. Surratt,

18:59.980 --> 19:02.972
in aid of the existing armed rebellion
against the United States,

19:02.983 --> 19:07.477
you are charged with having received,
entertained, harbored, concealed,

19:07.488 --> 19:10.480
aided and assisted John Wilkes Booth,

19:10.491 --> 19:13.358
John A. Surratt
and their confederates...

19:13.369 --> 19:16.532
David E. Herold...

19:16.538 --> 19:19.200
Lewis Payne...

19:19.208 --> 19:23.497
George A. Atzerodt...

19:23.504 --> 19:25.495
Michael O'Laughlen...

19:27.341 --> 19:29.002
Edmund Spangler...

19:31.178 --> 19:34.170
Samuel A. Mudd...

19:34.181 --> 19:35.921
and Samuel Arnold...

19:35.933 --> 19:38.049
in traitorous and
murderous conspiracy

19:38.060 --> 19:41.018
to kill then-President
Abraham Lincoln,

19:41.021 --> 19:42.852
Vice President Andrew Johnson

19:42.856 --> 19:46.348
and Secretary of State
William Seward.

19:46.360 --> 19:50.399
Pursuant to special orders
number 211 and 216,

19:50.406 --> 19:52.271
how do you plead?

19:55.160 --> 19:56.741
What say you, madam?

19:56.745 --> 19:58.531
Guilty or not?

20:01.959 --> 20:03.369
I am innocent.

20:03.377 --> 20:05.959
[crowd murmuring]

20:05.963 --> 20:08.625
In that case,
as each of the defendants

20:08.632 --> 20:11.294
has entered a not-guilty plea,
we will begin.

20:11.301 --> 20:13.212
Judge Advocate Holt,
please proceed.

20:14.888 --> 20:16.469
Just a moment, your honor.

20:16.473 --> 20:18.885
What is it, Senator?

20:18.892 --> 20:20.883
I... I wish to request an adjournment.

20:20.894 --> 20:23.886
An adjournment? We just got here.

20:23.897 --> 20:27.014
My client has been in custody
for a month,

20:27.026 --> 20:29.608
wasn't allowed to contact counsel
until yesterday.

20:29.611 --> 20:34.901
General Hunter, a delay will only serve
to prolong the nation's sorrow.

20:34.908 --> 20:36.068
My learned colleague,

20:36.076 --> 20:38.408
you've had over four week s
to prepare your case,

20:38.412 --> 20:40.744
no doubt assisted by
the entire War Department.

20:40.748 --> 20:44.115
I believe the defendant is entitled
to equal consideration.

20:44.126 --> 20:49.792
Senator Johnson, our fellow citizens must
be permitted to put this tragedy to rest.

20:49.798 --> 20:52.756
The sooner we dispose of this matter,
the better... for everyone.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.921
Everyone but my client.

20:54.928 --> 20:56.418
[crowd murmurs]

20:56.430 --> 20:59.638
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.

20:59.641 --> 21:02.053
In that case, I move for termination.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.346
Termination?

21:03.353 --> 21:06.186
On the grounds
this trial is unconstitutional.

21:06.190 --> 21:08.055
The defendant is a civilian

21:08.067 --> 21:11.810
entitled to a public trial
before a jury of her peers.

21:11.820 --> 21:16.439
The attorney general has affirmed
the legitimacy of this proceeding.

21:16.450 --> 21:18.907
Has he furnished a verdict as well?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.196
[murmurs and laughter]

21:20.204 --> 21:21.944
- Senator.
- [crowd silences]

21:21.955 --> 21:25.413
You will mind the horror
which summons us.

21:26.460 --> 21:27.825
Indeed.

21:27.836 --> 21:30.669
We all mourn the loss
of our leader,

21:30.672 --> 21:34.415
but in our grief, let us not betray
our better judgment

21:34.426 --> 21:36.838
and partake in an inquisition.

21:36.845 --> 21:38.881
Inquisition? How dare you?

21:38.889 --> 21:41.722
Sounds to me like we have
the enemy among us.

21:41.725 --> 21:45.434
Maryland not being among our most loyal
of states during the war,

21:45.437 --> 21:48.520
its senator ought to certify his allegiance
to this court.

21:48.524 --> 21:51.482
I have served this nation
as its attorney general.

21:51.485 --> 21:52.816
That is certification enough.

21:52.820 --> 21:55.027
Nevertheless,
we may require counsel

21:55.030 --> 21:58.147
to sign this oath of loyalty

21:58.158 --> 21:59.989
as prescribed by Congress.

21:59.993 --> 22:02.530
I am a member of Congress,

22:02.538 --> 22:05.154
the same body that creates armies,

22:05.165 --> 22:07.952
authorizes military tribunals

22:07.960 --> 22:10.827
and makes major generals like you.

22:10.838 --> 22:14.501
Our authorization comes
from the War secretary, Edwin Stanton,

22:14.508 --> 22:16.499
and by order of the president.

22:16.510 --> 22:20.924
If our founding fathers
had desired tyranny to prevail,

22:20.931 --> 22:23.513
the president
and his War secretary

22:23.517 --> 22:26.054
would have been granted
such indiscriminate powers,

22:26.061 --> 22:28.052
but they drafted a Constitution

22:28.063 --> 22:30.395
with laws against such powers.

22:30.399 --> 22:34.233
They did so precisely for times like this.

22:34.236 --> 22:36.693
[crowd clamoring]

22:38.824 --> 22:40.530
[booing and hissing]

22:42.369 --> 22:44.701
Order! Order! Order!

22:44.705 --> 22:47.788
SEN. JOHNSON: I really want you
to do this for me, Freddie.

22:47.791 --> 22:48.871
You're not serious.

22:48.876 --> 22:51.458
As serious as the charges
against our client.

22:51.461 --> 22:53.042
Me? Defend her?

22:56.175 --> 22:57.711
[laughs]

22:59.261 --> 23:00.922
She doesn't stand a chance

23:00.929 --> 23:03.215
with an old Southerner
like me defending her.

23:03.223 --> 23:05.259
She needs a Yankee captain like you.

23:05.267 --> 23:07.474
I'm sorry, sir. I... I can't do it.

23:07.477 --> 23:09.058
No, you'll do fine, son.

23:09.062 --> 23:10.302
Experience matters for nothing

23:10.314 --> 23:12.680
when they're making up the rules
as they go along.

23:13.901 --> 23:16.313
Besides, this government
has never executed a woman.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.312
They've never considered a woman,
nor a man for that matter,

23:19.323 --> 23:21.689
capable of murdering the president.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.658
Sir, I can find you a rebel
to defend her,

23:24.661 --> 23:26.617
but I ca... I won't do it.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.578
There is no court in the Union

23:28.582 --> 23:31.324
that would fairly judge that woman
with a Confederate counsel.

23:31.335 --> 23:32.950
I won't betray my country.

23:32.961 --> 23:35.373
I won't betray my friends
who died defending it.

23:35.380 --> 23:38.372
I'm not asking you to betray
your allegiances, Freddie.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.965
I'm simply ask in' you...
rather tellin' you...

23:40.969 --> 23:45.383
to obey your oath as a... as an attorney
and do your job.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.005
[sighs]

23:50.020 --> 23:52.432
He wants me to represent Mary Surratt.

23:52.439 --> 23:54.270
What?

23:58.403 --> 24:00.018
- What?
- Yeah.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.736
He can't be serious.

24:19.925 --> 24:21.916
[soldiers marching]

24:33.272 --> 24:35.604
SOLDIER: They're the actors
from the theater.

25:14.980 --> 25:15.969
Open up.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.515
[keys jangle]

25:21.403 --> 25:22.768
AIKEN: Thank you, soldier.

25:22.779 --> 25:24.394
That'll be all.

25:24.406 --> 25:26.397
[straw crunching]

25:33.206 --> 25:34.662
This conversation is privileged.

25:35.709 --> 25:37.324
Sorry, sir. Orders.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.577
Where is Senator Johnson?

25:40.839 --> 25:43.797
The senator has instructed me
to handle your case.

25:46.011 --> 25:48.002
You understand what you've been
charged with?

25:48.013 --> 25:51.050
Conspiring to murder the president,

25:51.058 --> 25:54.425
secretary of State
and the vice president...

25:55.562 --> 25:58.395
if found guilty, you could hang?

26:01.985 --> 26:04.021
No disrespect, Mr...

26:05.447 --> 26:06.687
Aiken.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.404
Mr. Aiken.

26:08.408 --> 26:10.490
How many years have you?

26:12.204 --> 26:13.740
27.

26:13.747 --> 26:16.705
So you've handled cases
like this before?

26:16.708 --> 26:18.869
There's never been
a case like this before.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.708
But you have defended others.

26:23.090 --> 26:24.626
[clears throat]

26:25.717 --> 26:28.459
They've left nothing to chance.

26:28.470 --> 26:29.550
Very well.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.385
[sighs]

26:31.390 --> 26:34.553
You own a boarding house
on 541 H Street?

26:34.559 --> 26:35.548
Is that correct?

26:35.560 --> 26:36.800
Yes.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.144
How long you been there?

26:41.942 --> 26:43.102
Ma'am?

26:44.236 --> 26:47.103
All I know about you
is what I read in the papers.

26:47.114 --> 26:48.149
It's not flattering.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.950
I moved to Washington a year ago

26:53.954 --> 26:56.946
with my son and daughter
after my husband passed.

26:56.957 --> 27:00.916
And the assassins were frequent
visitors to your home.

27:00.919 --> 27:03.205
Yes.

27:03.213 --> 27:04.419
Well, you... heh.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.084
You don't even deny
having been acquainted

27:06.091 --> 27:08.207
with John Wilkes Booth
and the others behind bars?

27:08.218 --> 27:10.129
No, sir, I do not.

27:13.890 --> 27:16.882
My husband died a drunk, Mr. Aiken,

27:16.893 --> 27:18.724
and left me loads of debt.

27:18.728 --> 27:22.437
I had to support my family,
so I rented rooms to boarders.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.272
Those men were customers,
nothing more.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.733
And you never considered
their allegiances?

27:26.736 --> 27:29.227
I didn't ask about their allegiances.

27:29.239 --> 27:31.070
What about yours, ma'am?

27:31.074 --> 27:33.281
I am a Southerner.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.617
I'm a Catholic

27:35.620 --> 27:38.077
and a devoted mother
above all else...

27:39.875 --> 27:41.786
but I am no assassin.

27:41.793 --> 27:45.456
Your freedom is gonna require
greater assurances than that.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.455
[shackles clanking]

27:50.385 --> 27:54.128
Then you tell me what I should say
to those generals.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.800
Oh, you can't say a thing.

27:55.807 --> 27:58.640
You're prohibited from testifying
in your own defense.

27:58.643 --> 28:01.350
Perhaps your son could speak for you.

28:01.354 --> 28:03.015
Any idea where he's hiding?

28:03.023 --> 28:04.263
No, I don't.

28:06.276 --> 28:10.269
All right. Is there anyone
who will give your version of events?

28:10.280 --> 28:12.191
You mean the truth?

28:12.199 --> 28:15.157
Well, obviously the government
believes your version is not the truth.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.775
Based on what?

28:16.786 --> 28:18.868
They're not releasing
their list of witnesses

28:18.872 --> 28:20.988
or the evidence they'll use against you.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.660
And can they do that?

28:22.667 --> 28:23.998
This kind of proceeding,

28:24.002 --> 28:25.993
they can do to you
whatever they want.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.835
Well, then what difference
does it make?

28:27.839 --> 28:29.670
Those generals
have made up their minds.

28:32.052 --> 28:34.543
I can tell by the way
they look at me.

28:34.554 --> 28:36.340
The way they look at you?

28:36.348 --> 28:40.182
Just the same way
you're looking at me.

28:40.185 --> 28:42.551
[chuckles]

28:42.562 --> 28:44.348
I have to go.

28:48.485 --> 28:49.691
Good day.

28:50.237 --> 28:53.479
Mr. Aiken, I haven't a word
from my daughter since I've been here.

28:53.490 --> 28:56.527
Would you look in on her for me?

28:56.535 --> 28:57.991
I'd be most grateful.

28:59.079 --> 29:00.535
Thank you.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.020
Soldier.

29:27.023 --> 29:30.060
Frederick Aiken,
lawyer to Mary Surratt.

30:10.275 --> 30:11.310
It's perfect.

30:11.318 --> 30:12.353
WOMAN: Pardon?

30:13.737 --> 30:16.444
- Anna Surratt?
- Mm-hmm.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.154
My name is Frederick Aiken.

30:18.158 --> 30:19.614
I'm representing your mother.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.405
What's perfect?

30:22.412 --> 30:23.572
[chuckles]

30:23.580 --> 30:25.116
Uh, nothing.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.705
No, do tell.

30:27.709 --> 30:30.917
I'm sure I've heard much worse.

30:30.920 --> 30:34.287
Well, I was just thinking
that this would be the perfect place

30:34.299 --> 30:36.005
to conspire to overthrow
the government.

30:36.009 --> 30:38.045
No one would ever suspect.

30:39.679 --> 30:41.169
Right?

30:42.265 --> 30:43.300
You alone here?

30:43.308 --> 30:44.639
Yes.

30:45.685 --> 30:48.722
Why? Are you afraid
to be seen with me?

30:48.730 --> 30:50.266
Eh...

30:50.273 --> 30:52.980
Your mother asked
that I look in on you.

30:55.028 --> 30:56.359
Please tell her not to worry,

30:57.322 --> 30:59.938
since I'm a prisoner in my own house.

31:00.825 --> 31:01.814
Where's your brother's room?

31:01.826 --> 31:03.612
Second floor, on the left.

32:25.201 --> 32:27.863
Did you find what you were looking for?

32:30.582 --> 32:31.742
Uh, yes.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.742
Did your brother share a room
with an L.J.W.?

32:34.753 --> 32:36.459
Louis J. Weichmann.

32:37.672 --> 32:40.414
He was like a son to my mother.
He'll swear she's innocent.

32:40.425 --> 32:41.835
I suppose he's disappeared, too.

32:44.679 --> 32:47.762
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Aiken?

32:47.766 --> 32:49.757
Uh-huh.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.931
Kill any on our side?

32:55.106 --> 32:56.516
Miss, do you have any documents

32:56.524 --> 32:59.516
indicating who stayed here
or a ledger of accounts?

33:02.781 --> 33:05.568
Do you want me to help
your mother or not?

33:12.457 --> 33:13.446
[chuckles]

33:18.630 --> 33:20.962
Is there anything else
you're concealing?

33:20.965 --> 33:22.080
Such as?

33:22.091 --> 33:23.797
Your brother, to start.
Look, if you know...

33:23.802 --> 33:25.963
[glass shatters,
Anna gasps]

33:25.970 --> 33:27.301
[horse neighs]

33:27.305 --> 33:28.670
[galloping hoofbeats]

33:28.681 --> 33:31.093
[dog barking]

33:34.145 --> 33:36.136
Did you see who threw that?

33:36.147 --> 33:37.136
No, sir.

33:42.946 --> 33:44.436
Are you hurt?

33:44.447 --> 33:45.653
I'm fine.

33:47.951 --> 33:50.818
Mr. Aiken, if you have no further
need of me...

34:11.724 --> 34:13.715
[overlapping conversations]

34:19.899 --> 34:23.187
Here. I'll give you two to sell.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.275
You have the latest on this one?

34:25.280 --> 34:26.520
That, I'll take two.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.485
Cigars! Jars!

34:29.492 --> 34:31.483
Picture frames!

34:31.494 --> 34:33.155
Original, right here, ma'am.

34:33.161 --> 34:35.619
Who wants a cigar?

34:35.623 --> 34:37.362
Fresh roasted nuts here.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.581
Fresh roasted nuts.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.425
Move along.
Mustn't keep it block ed.

34:52.431 --> 34:53.763
Thank you very much.

34:53.766 --> 34:54.846
SOLDIER: Left.

34:54.851 --> 34:56.341
Left, right, left.

34:56.351 --> 34:57.683
- Cigars!
- Left...

35:00.815 --> 35:01.895
Cigars!

35:01.900 --> 35:04.562
Left. Left. Left.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.525
Left, right, left.

35:06.529 --> 35:08.065
Left...

35:09.407 --> 35:11.739
Company, arms rest.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.529
- March.
- Shoulder arms.

35:13.536 --> 35:15.868
Quick step.

35:15.872 --> 35:18.329
Left.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.539
Left, right, left.

35:19.542 --> 35:21.828
A chance to get it back?

35:27.842 --> 35:28.877
BAKER: There he is.

35:28.885 --> 35:30.341
- Fred.
- Hey.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.961
Hamilton here has offered
to be your second chair.

35:32.972 --> 35:35.008
Oh. Re... Not a chance in hell.

35:35.016 --> 35:36.597
- No? You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

35:36.601 --> 35:37.966
I'll carry his briefcase,
but I'm not...

35:37.977 --> 35:39.012
[laughs]

35:42.565 --> 35:44.271
- Sarah.
- Fred.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.560
Why are you here?

35:46.235 --> 35:48.567
I'm trying to understand
why you're here.

35:48.571 --> 35:50.152
[gavel bangs]

35:52.659 --> 35:55.150
I suppose I should wish you luck.

36:05.088 --> 36:06.578
GEN. HUNTER: Come to order.

36:06.589 --> 36:08.420
[gavel bangs]

36:08.424 --> 36:10.085
How is Anna, Mr. Aiken?

36:10.093 --> 36:11.082
She's fine...

36:12.387 --> 36:14.878
looking forward
to when you come home.

36:18.267 --> 36:21.680
That's very nice of you to say, Mr. Aiken.

36:21.688 --> 36:25.556
GEN. HUNTER: Judge Advocate Holt,
will you please proceed?

36:26.609 --> 36:28.600
In the matter of Mary Surratt,

36:28.611 --> 36:32.024
the prosecution calls as its first witness
Mr. Louis Weichmann.

36:44.377 --> 36:46.459
I thought he was like family.
Why are they calling him?

36:46.462 --> 36:47.451
HOLT: Place your right hand on this Bible.

36:47.463 --> 36:48.498
I don't know.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.462
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

36:50.466 --> 36:52.627
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

36:52.635 --> 36:53.624
I do.

36:53.636 --> 36:54.671
Please.

36:57.932 --> 37:01.140
Are you acquainted with the defendant,
Mary Surratt?

37:01.144 --> 37:03.226
Yes. Yes, I am.

37:03.229 --> 37:06.016
I attended Divinity College
with her son John.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.184
And until recently,

37:07.191 --> 37:08.806
you resided at the boarding house

37:08.818 --> 37:10.729
owned by Mary Surratt.
Is that correct?

37:10.737 --> 37:12.523
That is correct, sir.

37:14.240 --> 37:18.279
Were any of these men
ever present in her home?

37:18.286 --> 37:19.617
Yes, sir.

37:19.620 --> 37:21.406
These three over there

37:21.414 --> 37:24.497
on several occasions.

37:25.501 --> 37:28.493
Let the record reflect
that the witness has identified

37:28.504 --> 37:31.996
the prisoners Herold,
Payne and Atzerodt.

37:36.387 --> 37:37.627
And who invited these men?

37:37.638 --> 37:38.923
John Surratt.

37:38.931 --> 37:40.011
Objection.

37:40.016 --> 37:42.177
Objection?

37:42.185 --> 37:44.927
Uh, uh...

37:44.937 --> 37:47.019
There's no way to prove
that John Surratt

37:47.023 --> 37:49.264
even knew these men,
let alone invited them.

37:50.693 --> 37:52.900
Mr. Surratt's absence
from this proceeding

37:52.904 --> 37:55.441
is Mr. Surratt's problem.

37:55.448 --> 37:57.655
Objection overruled.
Continue, Mr. Holt.

37:59.994 --> 38:04.283
Was John Wilkes Booth
also a frequent guest of John Surratt?

38:04.290 --> 38:06.576
Indeed, but all the Surratts adored him...

38:06.584 --> 38:09.200
John, his sister Anna
and their mother, too.

38:09.212 --> 38:10.873
And were there ever meetings

38:10.880 --> 38:13.622
held at the boarding house
involving Mr. Booth?

38:13.633 --> 38:17.421
Many, sometimes lasting
two, three hours

38:17.428 --> 38:20.215
and always in secret,
behind closed doors.

38:20.223 --> 38:21.838
[crowd murmurs]

38:21.849 --> 38:24.181
And did you ever see Mary Surratt

38:24.185 --> 38:26.392
object to these, uh, meetings?

38:26.395 --> 38:27.805
No, sir.

38:27.814 --> 38:30.726
Or to the presence of those men?

38:30.733 --> 38:31.768
No, she did not.

38:34.028 --> 38:35.939
- Thank you.
- She appeared to welcome them.

38:37.365 --> 38:39.151
Thank you. That'll be all,
Mr. Weichmann.

38:43.913 --> 38:46.325
[clears throat]

38:52.922 --> 38:53.911
[clears throat]

39:09.730 --> 39:14.690
How long did you say these
secret meetings lasted?

39:14.694 --> 39:17.936
At least two, three hours.

39:17.947 --> 39:19.483
You were timing them?

39:21.284 --> 39:23.275
Eh, if you were timing them,

39:23.286 --> 39:25.618
I suppose these secret meetings

39:25.621 --> 39:28.283
were not, in fact, kept secret from you.

39:28.291 --> 39:29.576
I knew about them, sir,

39:29.584 --> 39:32.075
but I had no knowledge
of what they were about.

39:32.086 --> 39:35.704
And that is because you never attended
any yourself, correct?

39:35.715 --> 39:37.455
Exactly.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.046
Why was that?

39:41.053 --> 39:43.135
I thought them suspicious.

39:43.139 --> 39:44.549
Suspicious?

39:44.557 --> 39:47.469
Well, then, you see, you did know
what they were about.

39:47.476 --> 39:50.388
No, sir, I did not.

39:51.564 --> 39:54.431
Then why were
your suspicions aroused?

39:54.442 --> 39:56.057
By the snatches
of rebel conversation

39:56.068 --> 39:58.980
I overheard in the hallways
and by their frequent whisperings.

39:59.989 --> 40:02.947
Well, in that case, if it was
of such great concern to you,

40:02.950 --> 40:06.863
why did you not report your suspicions
to your superiors at the War Department?

40:06.871 --> 40:08.327
I did.

40:08.331 --> 40:09.320
Excuse me?

40:09.332 --> 40:10.697
I did reveal my suspicions.

40:10.708 --> 40:14.121
I made a confidant of Captain Gleason
in the War Department.

40:14.128 --> 40:16.164
[laughter]

40:23.638 --> 40:25.845
GEN. HUNTER:
Mr. Aiken, if there's nothing else...

40:28.517 --> 40:30.758
Counselor, will that be all?

40:31.938 --> 40:32.973
Uh, yes.

40:32.980 --> 40:34.390
Uh, no.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.516
No. No, I do have something else.

40:42.198 --> 40:45.281
Tell me, Mr. Weichmann. Tell us all.

40:46.035 --> 40:47.775
- You ever been in Richmond?
- HOLT: Objection.

40:47.787 --> 40:49.618
I merely wish to know if the witness

40:49.622 --> 40:51.988
has ever visited the capital
of the Confederacy.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.910
I don't recall.

40:53.918 --> 40:57.376
Then perhaps this train receipt
will refresh your memory.

40:57.380 --> 40:59.245
It indicates passage to Richmond,

40:59.257 --> 41:02.124
and it has your initials on it.

41:03.469 --> 41:05.130
Yes. [chuckles]

41:05.137 --> 41:06.172
That's right.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.849
I considered continuing my divinity studies
there after the war.

41:11.852 --> 41:13.843
I plan on becoming a priest.

41:13.854 --> 41:15.094
That's very nice.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.097
Do you recall, Mr. Weichmann,

41:17.108 --> 41:21.021
at which institute in Richmond
you were thinking of enrolling?

41:21.028 --> 41:22.063
The name?

41:22.071 --> 41:23.402
Yes, Mr. Weichmann, the name.

41:23.406 --> 41:24.566
Well, uh...

41:24.573 --> 41:26.313
- There is no academy of the kind...
- Objection.

41:26.325 --> 41:27.735
...in Richmond, is there,
Mr. Weichmann?

41:27.743 --> 41:29.608
- In fact, perhaps you visited Richmond...
- Objection, General.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.951
...for another purpose entirely.

41:30.955 --> 41:32.115
Objection sustained.

41:34.750 --> 41:37.992
You worked for the general in charge
of rebel prisoners, did you not?

41:38.004 --> 41:39.164
Yes.

41:39.171 --> 41:40.251
So?

41:40.256 --> 41:44.716
Perhaps a distinguished clerk like yourself
knew certain information.

41:44.719 --> 41:46.255
What sort of information?

41:46.262 --> 41:49.095
Information that might have been of
"divine" interest

41:49.098 --> 41:51.680
to certain rebels within the capital
of the Confederacy.

41:51.684 --> 41:52.719
Objection, General.

41:52.727 --> 41:54.592
The witness is not on trial here.

41:54.603 --> 41:56.139
PAYNE: Well, he ought to be!

41:56.147 --> 41:57.182
[crowd gasping]

41:57.189 --> 41:58.269
Objection sustained.

41:58.274 --> 41:59.889
The witness is not on trial.

41:59.900 --> 42:03.233
Sir, I am merely trying to establish
the witness' credibility

42:03.237 --> 42:06.195
or rather the lack of credibility
of this man.

42:06.198 --> 42:09.281
Mr. Aiken, you are incriminating
the witness.

42:09.285 --> 42:10.525
Incriminating? Sir,

42:10.536 --> 42:13.198
Louis Weichmann shared a room
with John Surratt.

42:13.205 --> 42:15.787
I have a tick et that puts him
in Richmond.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.577
I think it reasonable to assume

42:17.585 --> 42:20.292
that he knows more about this plot
to assassinate our president

42:20.296 --> 42:21.877
than he supposedly reported.

42:21.881 --> 42:24.338
What Mr. Aiken think s
is entirely immaterial.

42:24.342 --> 42:28.005
Counselor, unless you have something
more relevant to ask,

42:28.012 --> 42:29.673
the witness will step down.

42:29.680 --> 42:30.840
No.

42:30.848 --> 42:35.012
No, I have nothing more... relevant to ask.

42:35.019 --> 42:37.010
[crowd murmuring]

42:53.120 --> 42:55.486
HAMILTON:
You never... you never ask a question

42:55.498 --> 42:56.533
you don't know the answer to.

42:56.540 --> 42:57.746
I know. I know.

42:57.750 --> 43:00.662
How... How did you know Weichmann
was lying about Richmond, Fred?

43:00.669 --> 43:02.330
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

43:02.338 --> 43:03.828
[sputters]

43:03.839 --> 43:05.454
S-so you gambled twice?

43:05.466 --> 43:07.377
How did you pass the bar?

43:07.385 --> 43:09.501
Heh heh. Well, will, it work ed.

43:09.512 --> 43:12.879
I mean, Fred made Weichmann
look as guilty as the others.

43:12.890 --> 43:14.551
- It was perfect.
- You're right.

43:15.434 --> 43:17.345
And that's the problem.

43:18.521 --> 43:19.931
They all look guilty.

43:19.939 --> 43:21.099
Freddie, I'm sorry.

43:21.107 --> 43:23.348
First the senator drops your client
like a load,

43:23.359 --> 43:25.691
and then with all these
secret meetings taking place,

43:26.487 --> 43:27.818
either she knew what was going on...

43:27.822 --> 43:30.063
Or she damn well should have known.

43:32.743 --> 43:34.324
[knock on door]

43:36.956 --> 43:38.492
Senator?

43:38.999 --> 43:40.205
In here.

43:48.592 --> 43:50.924
I think she's as guilty as Booth.

43:50.928 --> 43:52.919
How could I possibly defend her?

43:54.598 --> 43:58.056
You assume that she's guilty,
like the Commission.

43:58.060 --> 43:59.766
You don't have any proof.

43:59.770 --> 44:00.885
Proof or no,

44:01.814 --> 44:03.600
don't give a damn what happens to her.

44:07.987 --> 44:09.318
I tell you what.

44:09.321 --> 44:12.358
If you can prove that she's guilty,

44:12.366 --> 44:14.698
you can take yourself off the case.

44:14.702 --> 44:16.363
Thank you, sir.

44:16.370 --> 44:19.077
You think it'll be that easy?

44:19.081 --> 44:20.491
I know it.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.217
Pardon me, Father.

44:33.220 --> 44:35.506
I wish to confer with the prisoner.

44:35.514 --> 44:38.301
Alone, if you don't mind.

44:39.393 --> 44:41.179
It's... It's quite all right, Mary.

44:41.187 --> 44:42.848
I... I must be going anyway.

44:42.855 --> 44:45.517
All right. Well, thank you
for visiting, Father.

44:45.524 --> 44:47.435
I'll see you soon.

44:47.443 --> 44:49.900
Your words were most comforting.

44:49.904 --> 44:51.269
The Lord's with you.

44:59.038 --> 45:02.246
She's refusing to eat.

45:02.249 --> 45:05.457
I've tried to convince her to no avail.

45:05.461 --> 45:08.328
Perhaps you could help her.

45:08.339 --> 45:09.419
Mm.

45:14.303 --> 45:16.294
"Search me, and know my heart.

45:16.305 --> 45:18.296
"Try me, and know my thoughts.

45:19.099 --> 45:21.431
And see if there be any wicked way in me."

45:25.314 --> 45:27.305
"The Lord knows the way of the wick ed.

45:27.316 --> 45:29.147
And the way of the wicked will perish."

45:29.151 --> 45:31.483
You know your Proverbs, young man.

45:31.487 --> 45:32.522
Mm-hmm.

45:32.530 --> 45:33.986
My father was a minister.

45:33.989 --> 45:35.945
He taught them to me as a child.

45:39.495 --> 45:43.363
So, what is it you wish to know?

45:43.374 --> 45:46.537
Why Booth and his associates
were constants in your home.

45:46.544 --> 45:49.126
I ran a boarding house, Mr. Aiken.

45:49.129 --> 45:52.462
Forgive me if I chose
to fill it with boarders.

45:52.466 --> 45:54.172
I checked your registry, ma'am.

45:54.176 --> 45:56.883
There's no record Booth ever
stayed at your home.

45:56.887 --> 46:00.550
No, the fact is he stayed at the National
whenever he came to Washington,

46:00.558 --> 46:03.595
so why was Booth in your home?

46:03.602 --> 46:06.935
I suppose my son invited him.
They were friends.

46:06.939 --> 46:09.146
[chuckles]
Famous actor like Booth?

46:09.149 --> 46:11.185
Engaging your son
out of friendship?

46:11.193 --> 46:14.560
Mr. Aiken, my son is no less
a gentleman than you

46:14.572 --> 46:18.064
and very capable of forming
acquaintances in society.

46:18.075 --> 46:21.317
I've... I've read all about
your family's acquaintances, ma'am,

46:21.328 --> 46:26.322
about how your late husband contributed
to the Confederate cause

46:26.333 --> 46:28.198
and about your Gentleman Johnny.

46:28.210 --> 46:30.121
What about him?

46:30.129 --> 46:35.169
He made quite a sum as a courier
carrying rebel secrets across Union lines.

46:35.175 --> 46:36.961
Oh, I'm well aware

46:36.969 --> 46:39.631
of what your family's capable of,
Mrs. Surratt,

46:39.638 --> 46:43.426
so I know you're not
telling me the truth.

46:43.434 --> 46:45.925
Well, then you know what I do not.

46:45.936 --> 46:48.222
You were despondent
over losing the war,

46:48.230 --> 46:51.222
and you would have done anything
you could to save the Confederacy,

46:51.233 --> 46:52.723
including using your own son John.

46:52.735 --> 46:53.975
Honestly, Mr. Aiken.

46:53.986 --> 46:56.272
So you arranged a meeting with Booth,

46:56.280 --> 46:58.396
figuring he'd befriend your son
because of what he knew,

46:58.407 --> 46:59.863
what expert couriers do know.

46:59.867 --> 47:02.279
And what might that be?

47:02.286 --> 47:04.402
The best escape routes out of town.

47:06.081 --> 47:09.369
Your son was supposed to lead the others
to freedom that night, wasn't he?

47:09.376 --> 47:11.458
Except he was the only one
that got away.

47:12.588 --> 47:14.670
My son was in Canada that day.

47:14.673 --> 47:16.004
Can you prove that?

47:16.008 --> 47:18.920
I received a letter on April 14,

47:18.927 --> 47:22.385
same day as the assassination,

47:22.389 --> 47:24.129
sent from Montreal.

47:24.141 --> 47:26.177
Where is this letter?

47:26.185 --> 47:27.766
I don't know.

47:27.770 --> 47:29.635
I'm done,

47:29.647 --> 47:30.978
done defending your lies.

47:30.981 --> 47:33.267
You're so blind with hatred, Mr. Aiken,

47:33.275 --> 47:34.685
you can't even see the truth.

47:35.736 --> 47:38.398
Yes, my son hated the North.
We all did.

47:38.405 --> 47:42.239
How can a Southerner feel anything
but bitterness toward your side?

47:42.242 --> 47:45.200
But my son did not conspire
to kill your president.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.741
He conspired to kidnap him.

47:50.918 --> 47:52.909
[hoofbeats]

47:55.089 --> 47:58.456
All right, here he comes.

47:58.467 --> 48:00.378
Ready your mount.

48:01.428 --> 48:03.089
Surratt, where the hell's Booth?

48:03.097 --> 48:04.633
He'll be here.

48:07.643 --> 48:10.009
All right, steady.

48:14.358 --> 48:15.723
BOOTH: Wait!

48:16.819 --> 48:19.060
He's not coming!

48:20.280 --> 48:21.986
Lincoln's changed his plans.

48:21.990 --> 48:23.776
- What?
- He's still in town.

48:23.784 --> 48:25.866
He just gave a speech
at the National.

48:38.841 --> 48:41.002
Anna, back upstairs.

48:49.268 --> 48:50.303
[door opens]

48:50.310 --> 48:52.016
MAN: Who was in the carriage?

48:52.020 --> 48:54.978
BOOTH: Doesn't matter. What matters
is he wasn't in the carriage.

48:54.982 --> 48:56.017
You should have known.

48:56.024 --> 48:57.013
ATZERODT:
What about the weapons?

48:57.025 --> 48:58.310
BOOTH:
We need to hide these weapons.

48:58.318 --> 48:59.524
JOHN: We can take them to Lloyd's.

48:59.528 --> 49:00.563
I'll take 'em.

49:00.571 --> 49:02.107
You'd shoot your own foot off.

49:02.114 --> 49:03.194
I said I'd do it.

49:03.198 --> 49:04.313
Don't push me.

49:04.324 --> 49:05.939
Enough!

49:05.951 --> 49:09.159
Fools like you are the reason
we can lose this fight.

49:16.879 --> 49:20.963
MARY: Johnny Surratt,
I'd like a word with you, please.

49:20.966 --> 49:22.957
Well, answer, Johnny.
Your mama's callin'.

49:26.221 --> 49:29.258
MARY: They planned on ransoming
Lincoln in ex change

49:29.266 --> 49:32.349
for all the Confederate soldiers
in your prisons.

49:32.352 --> 49:33.888
Why didn't you report them
to the authorities?

49:33.896 --> 49:36.512
Because one of them was my son.

49:36.523 --> 49:37.763
So rather than kidnap him,

49:37.775 --> 49:39.515
your son helped murder
the president instead.

49:39.526 --> 49:40.561
No.

49:40.569 --> 49:43.436
They nearly got the vice president
and the secretary of State.

49:43.447 --> 49:45.028
No, it's not true. It's not my Johnny.

49:45.032 --> 49:47.239
Damn it, ma'am, you just said
he was Booth's right hand.

49:47.242 --> 49:49.904
My son is not a murderer, Mr. Aiken.

49:49.912 --> 49:51.823
All right, then.

49:51.830 --> 49:53.411
Swear to it.

49:57.586 --> 49:59.577
MARY: Supper will be ready shortly.

50:01.048 --> 50:02.083
John?

50:02.090 --> 50:04.206
Can't stay, mama.

50:04.218 --> 50:06.334
I have to leave town straightaway.

50:06.345 --> 50:07.710
What's so pressing?

50:07.721 --> 50:09.427
Nothing that need worry you.

50:09.431 --> 50:12.218
Just some cotton speculatin'. That's all.

50:12.226 --> 50:14.387
Don't sport with me, son.

50:14.394 --> 50:16.476
You're not steppin' outside this house.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.516
Don't talk to me like I'm a child!

50:18.524 --> 50:20.936
Richmond's falling.
Something must be done.

50:20.943 --> 50:24.151
Johnny, I'm aware of the news
from Richmond,

50:24.154 --> 50:26.145
and it pains me terribly.

50:26.156 --> 50:27.271
Supper's ready.

50:27.282 --> 50:30.194
Wh... what is it?

50:30.202 --> 50:31.237
I'm leaving town.

50:31.245 --> 50:32.701
MARY: No, you're not leaving town.

50:32.704 --> 50:33.739
Yes, I am.

50:33.747 --> 50:35.408
You and Anna are the
only family I've got left,

50:35.415 --> 50:37.997
and I'll be damned if I let you go out there
and do something else foolish.

50:38.001 --> 50:39.161
- Foolish?
- Johnny...

50:39.169 --> 50:41.410
What I'm fightin' for is far more important
than any of us.

50:41.421 --> 50:43.161
Your family is more important
than anything.

50:43.173 --> 50:44.333
That is your responsibility!

50:44.341 --> 50:47.424
All of our men are buried underground
right now.

50:47.427 --> 50:48.883
- The war is over.
- Oh, you're wrong about that.

50:48.887 --> 50:50.343
There is nothing left for you to do.

50:50.347 --> 50:52.178
The war is far from over,
and there's still plenty I can do.

50:52.182 --> 50:53.422
- Johnny, please.
- Unhand me, Mother.

50:53.433 --> 50:54.639
- Unhand me, Mother.
- Please, Anna.

50:54.643 --> 50:55.974
ANNA: John!

50:55.978 --> 50:57.468
Mother.

50:57.479 --> 50:59.140
BOOTH:
John, are you coming or not?

50:59.147 --> 51:00.387
Johnny, please.

51:00.399 --> 51:03.482
If this cause ain't worth fightin' for,
then what is?

51:06.405 --> 51:07.895
So that was the last time
you saw your son?

51:07.906 --> 51:09.021
Yes.

51:09.032 --> 51:10.988
Less than two week s
before the assassination?

51:11.535 --> 51:12.069
Yes.

51:12.077 --> 51:13.817
So then, you see, you admit

51:13.829 --> 51:16.195
that your son conspired to kill
President Lincoln.

51:16.206 --> 51:18.322
I don't know.

51:20.335 --> 51:21.950
May God help you.

51:21.962 --> 51:24.328
Honestly, Mr. Aiken, I don't know.

51:28.385 --> 51:30.000
Lord, I pray not.

51:31.054 --> 51:35.423
All I know is that I did not.

51:39.521 --> 51:40.931
I swear.

51:51.992 --> 51:53.983
[horse neighs]

52:02.336 --> 52:03.746
Miss Surratt.

52:05.255 --> 52:06.995
[sighs] You have to tell me exactly...

52:07.007 --> 52:08.042
How is my mother?

52:08.050 --> 52:09.711
She's managing.
You have to tell me

52:09.718 --> 52:10.753
exactly what happened here.

52:10.761 --> 52:11.967
What do you mean?

52:11.970 --> 52:14.131
Do you know that Louis Weichmann,
uh, your friend,

52:14.139 --> 52:16.175
testified against your mother

52:16.183 --> 52:18.595
after you told me
he was like a son to her?

52:19.811 --> 52:21.551
What went on here?

52:21.563 --> 52:23.144
Why should I trust you?

52:23.148 --> 52:25.013
Because your mother
told me everything.

52:25.025 --> 52:26.765
She told me about John.

52:28.987 --> 52:31.899
She told me about the plot to kidnap
President Lincoln.

52:33.408 --> 52:37.526
Anna, did you try and stop him?

52:37.537 --> 52:39.528
How was I supposed to do that?

52:39.539 --> 52:40.904
'Cause you're his older sister.

52:40.916 --> 52:43.157
You don't know how stubborn
my brother can be.

52:43.168 --> 52:46.581
All right. Did your brother
conspire to kill the president?

52:46.588 --> 52:48.453
My brother left town week s
before the assassination.

52:48.465 --> 52:49.955
It proves nothing. Look, the night
he left the boarding house...

52:49.967 --> 52:51.002
I've said all I will.

52:51.009 --> 52:52.715
Miss Surratt, I'm trying...

52:52.719 --> 52:55.131
I'm trying to help.

52:55.138 --> 52:57.254
By condemning my brother?

52:57.265 --> 53:01.304
Mr. Aiken, my mother would never
allow that, and neither would I.

53:01.311 --> 53:05.224
Oh. All right. All right, look,
you knew about Weichmann.

53:05.232 --> 53:08.975
If you know any potential witnesses
the prosecution might call

53:08.986 --> 53:11.318
or what evidence
they'll use against her,

53:11.321 --> 53:12.652
you must tell me.

53:16.118 --> 53:17.483
Will you help me?

53:18.203 --> 53:19.613
HOLT: Let us proceed with events

53:19.621 --> 53:21.657
following the assassination
of President Lincoln.

53:21.665 --> 53:23.405
On the night of April 17,

53:23.417 --> 53:25.123
what were your duties, Major Smith?

53:25.127 --> 53:27.083
I was charged with finding John Surratt,

53:27.087 --> 53:30.170
and we were searching the house.

53:30.173 --> 53:31.959
Major, I found these.

53:31.967 --> 53:34.629
They were here
in the daughter's bedroom.

53:43.812 --> 53:47.680
Major Smith, please read aloud
what's inscribed here.

53:47.691 --> 53:49.522
<i>"Sic semper tyrannis."</i>

53:51.028 --> 53:52.313
Could you translate?

53:52.320 --> 53:54.436
Of course.
"Thus always for tyrants."

53:54.448 --> 53:56.188
Are those words familiar to you?

53:56.199 --> 53:57.439
Indeed.

53:57.451 --> 54:00.443
Booth yelled them
after he cut down our president.

54:00.454 --> 54:03.241
You found the same three days later

54:03.248 --> 54:05.660
in her daughter's bedroom
next to a photograph

54:05.667 --> 54:06.907
of the assassin himself.

54:08.170 --> 54:09.831
Like a shrine, sir.

54:09.838 --> 54:11.248
Uh...

54:11.256 --> 54:12.837
Please continue.

54:12.841 --> 54:15.253
Uh, objection.

54:15.260 --> 54:18.218
<i>Sic semper tyrannis
is the state motto of Virginia.</i>

54:18.221 --> 54:21.213
It hardly constitutes proof
of a shrine to Booth.

54:21.224 --> 54:23.340
No further proof is needed,
Mr. Aiken.

54:23.351 --> 54:24.511
Proceed, Mr. Holt.

54:25.937 --> 54:27.302
Continue, Major Smith.

54:28.356 --> 54:30.813
As I was fixing to take the Surratts
to headquarters for questioning,

54:30.817 --> 54:32.478
there was a knock at the door.

54:32.486 --> 54:33.601
You all right, ma'am?

54:33.612 --> 54:34.727
[knocking]

54:46.041 --> 54:47.747
I... I must be mistaken.

54:47.751 --> 54:49.707
MAJ. SMITH: Wait a minute.

54:49.711 --> 54:52.043
Whom do you wish to see?

54:52.047 --> 54:53.833
Uh, Mrs. Surratt.

54:53.840 --> 54:56.047
This is her place.
Bring him in.

55:05.310 --> 55:06.800
Is she expecting you?

55:07.354 --> 55:10.221
She sent for me, asked me
to dig a gutter for her.

55:10.232 --> 55:11.722
At this time of night?

55:11.733 --> 55:15.317
In the morning. I just wanted
to know what time.

55:15.320 --> 55:18.312
Bring Mrs. Surratt in here.

55:23.620 --> 55:26.828
Ma'am, did you hire this man
to dig a gutter for you?

55:28.083 --> 55:29.619
No, sir.

55:29.626 --> 55:31.082
Do you know this man?

55:36.383 --> 55:37.793
No, sir.

55:40.595 --> 55:43.382
Is this the man
she denies knowing?

55:43.390 --> 55:44.926
No, sir.

55:49.104 --> 55:51.311
Is this the man
she denies knowing?

55:51.314 --> 55:52.770
Yes, sir.

55:54.151 --> 55:55.607
Lewis Payne.

55:57.154 --> 55:59.611
The same man boarded at the Surratts'

55:59.614 --> 56:03.778
prior to daggering the secretary of State
and his kin.

56:03.785 --> 56:05.116
Yes.

56:05.120 --> 56:07.202
Thank you, Major.
Nothing further.

56:14.421 --> 56:15.456
[sighs]

56:26.641 --> 56:29.678
Major Smith, are you aware
that Lewis Payne

56:29.686 --> 56:32.018
boarded at the Surratts' under an alias,

56:32.022 --> 56:35.139
claiming to be a Baptist minister
from Baltimore named Wood?

56:35.150 --> 56:36.936
That's what she claimed.

56:36.943 --> 56:37.978
She claimed?

56:37.986 --> 56:43.447
I would like to submit into evidence
this ledger of guest accounts

56:43.450 --> 56:45.486
from the Surratt boarding house.

56:45.493 --> 56:49.486
Supposing, as this evidence would seem
to suggest, that were the truth...

56:49.497 --> 56:51.488
suppose Mrs. Surratt
simply failed that night

56:51.499 --> 56:53.160
to recognize Wood the preacher

56:53.168 --> 56:55.750
in the guise of Payne the ditch digger.

56:55.754 --> 56:59.542
He was standing in full view of her
not three paces.

57:01.176 --> 57:04.168
General Hunter, since accepting this case,

57:04.179 --> 57:08.673
I have come to learn that my client's
eyesight is defective.

57:09.684 --> 57:13.176
I have here a sworn affidavit
from her doctor stating just that.

57:13.188 --> 57:16.772
Major Smith, it was dark.
It was nighttime.

57:16.775 --> 57:20.438
Isn't it possible Mary Surratt simply...

57:20.445 --> 57:21.935
failed to see him?

57:23.031 --> 57:24.692
If I saw a man dressed as a preacher

57:24.699 --> 57:26.439
and two months later a laborer,

57:26.451 --> 57:28.863
then I would recognize him
as the same person.

57:28.870 --> 57:29.905
Thank you, Major Smith.

57:29.913 --> 57:32.029
A simple yes or no will do.

57:32.040 --> 57:34.782
Is it possible she failed
to see him properly?

57:35.335 --> 57:37.246
Yes, I suppose it's possible.

57:37.254 --> 57:39.245
No further questions.

57:39.256 --> 57:43.295
The prosecution seems unable
to present any proof of guilt

57:43.301 --> 57:45.337
beyond a reasonable doubt.

57:49.349 --> 57:51.340
[silverware clinking]

57:53.019 --> 57:58.639
Uh, could somebody bring me
the transcript of today's trial?

57:58.650 --> 58:00.436
Shall I read it aloud to you?

58:00.443 --> 58:01.478
Oh, Ed.

58:03.238 --> 58:06.651
Your young associate is
putting up a spirited defense.

58:06.658 --> 58:10.992
Reminds me of a certain lawyer
I had to face 25 years ago.

58:10.996 --> 58:13.362
Ah, he learned to fight in your army.

58:13.373 --> 58:15.159
Can I get you a drink?

58:15.166 --> 58:18.158
No, no. No, I won't be staying long.
Reverdy...

58:22.507 --> 58:25.374
You've done as much for this nation
as any man I know.

58:25.385 --> 58:28.127
Oh. Feeling's mutual, Ed.

58:28.138 --> 58:32.222
Don't you think it's time for us two
old war horses to call a truce?

58:32.225 --> 58:33.510
Heh heh.

58:33.518 --> 58:36.726
Not if you insist on staging
this travesty.

58:36.730 --> 58:39.847
This trial will do more
to keep the peace

58:39.858 --> 58:41.849
than any paper treaty could.

58:41.860 --> 58:44.317
Heh. How'd you convince
yourself of that?

58:44.321 --> 58:46.903
Because justice, swift and firm,

58:46.906 --> 58:49.898
will help deter the South
from ever conspiring again,

58:49.909 --> 58:52.901
as well as discouraging the North
from seeking revenge.

58:52.912 --> 58:54.868
What about the rule of law?

58:54.873 --> 58:58.741
My first responsibility is to ensure
that this war stays won.

58:58.752 --> 59:00.083
Oh, and this is how you do it,

59:00.086 --> 59:02.577
by keeping fear alive
as long as you see fit?

59:02.589 --> 59:05.501
Look. "Stanton warns
of future rebel plots,"

59:05.508 --> 59:08.124
uh, water supplies poisoned, um...

59:08.136 --> 59:10.343
firebombing cities.

59:10.347 --> 59:13.430
Uh, yellow fever spreading
all over the place.

59:13.433 --> 59:16.140
This is a frightened country, Ed.

59:16.144 --> 59:17.725
You don't need to scare us anymore.

59:17.729 --> 59:20.095
And who is to say that none
of these things could happen?

59:21.024 --> 59:22.980
The unspeakable already has...

59:22.984 --> 59:26.272
Our president assassinated,
600,000 dead.

59:26.279 --> 59:28.110
The world has changed, Reverdy.

59:28.114 --> 59:32.323
Abandoning the Constitution
is not the answer.

59:36.498 --> 59:38.614
You may prefer dining alone.

59:38.625 --> 59:41.708
I just hope your young associate
does as well.

59:41.711 --> 59:43.326
If he pushes too hard,

59:43.338 --> 59:46.125
he will make enemies
who will not soon forget.

59:47.092 --> 59:48.957
On this, you know I'm right.

01:00:02.774 --> 01:00:04.184
[coughs]

01:00:07.821 --> 01:00:09.061
[coughing]

01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:14.817
[gasping]

01:00:27.799 --> 01:00:29.460
I'm here to see Secretary Stanton, boys.

01:00:29.467 --> 01:00:31.003
Stand down.

01:00:31.845 --> 01:00:34.678
Sorry, sir. Mr. Stanton doesn't see anyone
without an appointment.

01:00:35.306 --> 01:00:36.341
Well, good morning, Mr. Aiken.

01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:37.338
Morning.

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:39.636
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

01:00:39.644 --> 01:00:42.181
If you can arrange an appointment
for me with the secretary, you can.

01:00:42.188 --> 01:00:44.349
Unfortunately he's quite busy right now,

01:00:44.357 --> 01:00:46.518
but perhaps you'd care
to have a word with me instead.

01:00:47.694 --> 01:00:48.934
Please.

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.023
[sighs]

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:53.692
My client is unwell.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.237
So I hear.
Touch of the woman's curse.

01:00:56.244 --> 01:00:59.657
I'm sure she'll be well enough
to continue her trial in a few days.

01:00:59.664 --> 01:01:01.996
She's been in solitary confinement
for over a month.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.116
She hasn't eaten in over a week.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:05.333
She's refusing to eat.

01:01:05.336 --> 01:01:07.327
All the prisoners are fed daily.

01:01:07.338 --> 01:01:08.669
Soft bread and salted meat.

01:01:08.673 --> 01:01:11.130
Unless she has a proper meal
and some fresh air,

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.999
I can't guarantee
she'll be fit for trial.

01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:16.219
One of the conspirators
refuses to be guarded by a Negro,

01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:18.679
and the other insists on only eating
his mother's cooking.

01:01:18.683 --> 01:01:19.889
We can't accommodate every whim.

01:01:19.893 --> 01:01:23.477
Come now. I am merely asking for you
to stop treating her like a savage.

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.562
How dare you accuse us of savagery?

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.357
Have you forgotten how our own
were treated by the rebels?

01:01:30.361 --> 01:01:31.396
Of course not.

01:01:31.404 --> 01:01:32.393
Well...

01:01:32.405 --> 01:01:35.238
But Mary Surratt is in serious decline.

01:01:35.241 --> 01:01:38.950
If this treatment of her continues,
she will not be sound of mind.

01:01:38.953 --> 01:01:42.571
And I trust that is something
the government wishes to avoid.

01:01:44.709 --> 01:01:49.043
I may have a way to serve all interests.

01:01:49.047 --> 01:01:53.131
I'll deny ever telling you this.
Understood?

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:56.168
[men talking outside]

01:01:59.766 --> 01:02:01.097
[dog barking]

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.975
Father.

01:02:11.986 --> 01:02:13.021
Counselor.

01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:18.439
F eel that sun.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.657
Do I have you to thank for this?

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:27.874
Well, thank you.

01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:33.296
Well, if I could just get you
to start eating.

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.799
SOLDIER: Left. Left.

01:02:36.803 --> 01:02:38.168
Left, right, left.

01:02:38.179 --> 01:02:39.214
[sighs]

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:40.302
Company halt.

01:02:40.306 --> 01:02:42.718
Mary, there's something
I need to ask you.

01:02:44.602 --> 01:02:45.887
Um...

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:47.977
I've never seen you at a loss for words,
young man.

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:49.016
Heh.

01:02:52.485 --> 01:02:54.100
Do you know where your son is hiding?

01:02:54.112 --> 01:02:55.192
Johnny?

01:02:55.196 --> 01:02:56.311
Of course not.

01:02:56.322 --> 01:02:58.813
Government believes you do.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.485
What do you believe?

01:03:04.497 --> 01:03:05.862
Heh.

01:03:05.873 --> 01:03:08.831
I believe you know more
than you're willing to tell me.

01:03:08.835 --> 01:03:15.502
Uh, have you ever cared for something
greater than yourself?

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:20.419
I've spent these last four years

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.842
fighting for something
greater than myself,

01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:24.680
so don't...

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:27.429
Then we are the same.

01:03:34.068 --> 01:03:37.526
Mary, you have to tell us
where your son is.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:40.237
Us?

01:03:40.241 --> 01:03:42.482
I have to tell "us"?

01:03:42.493 --> 01:03:43.983
Whose side are you on?

01:03:43.995 --> 01:03:45.485
I'm trying to defend you.

01:03:45.496 --> 01:03:48.613
By suggesting I trade
my son for myself?

01:03:50.043 --> 01:03:53.160
You're trying to save you, Mr. Aiken.

01:03:53.171 --> 01:03:57.005
I wish I could give you
what you need. I truly do.

01:03:57.008 --> 01:04:00.466
But if you want out,
you'll have to find another way.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.431
I'm gonna take a walk.

01:04:07.435 --> 01:04:08.766
It's so nice out.

01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:11.102
Do you care to walk with me?

01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:16.103
So we're stuck
in these shallow trenches.

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:17.316
We're surrounded on all sides.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.151
Nobody knows what to do.
Nobody knows what to say.

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:21.362
We're frozen,
completely petrified.

01:04:21.366 --> 01:04:22.902
And then from somewhere
up on the hill,

01:04:22.909 --> 01:04:25.070
we hear this loud
booming Southern voice.

01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:26.363
It's the rebel general.

01:04:26.371 --> 01:04:28.612
He yells, "Y'all boys
better say your prayers,

01:04:28.623 --> 01:04:31.160
because there are 400 of us
and only 100 of you."

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.532
You can stop right there, Baker.

01:04:32.543 --> 01:04:34.750
And so then this madman,
he stands up,

01:04:34.754 --> 01:04:36.995
and he yells back to him,
and he says...

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:39.213
he says, "Hundred?
Heck, we've got less than that.

01:04:39.217 --> 01:04:41.424
But we don't surrender,
so come and get us."

01:04:41.427 --> 01:04:42.462
And with that,

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:44.882
he pulls down his pants
and bares his arse.

01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:46.550
[laughter]

01:04:46.557 --> 01:04:47.592
You didn't.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.716
- I didn't.
- What?

01:04:49.727 --> 01:04:52.719
It doesn't seem as though Fred
ever intends to surrender.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.470
Ah, it appears he already has.

01:04:54.482 --> 01:04:57.315
She's fair, fit and 40.

01:04:57.318 --> 01:04:58.433
[scattered laughter]

01:04:58.444 --> 01:05:00.810
WOMAN:
Is it true Mrs. Surratt is a Catholic,

01:05:00.822 --> 01:05:02.608
wears black from head to toe?

01:05:02.615 --> 01:05:06.153
I hear she spits in the faces
of every Union soldier she encounters.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.323
Apparently she wears a necklace
made from the bone of a Union soldier.

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:12.322
Seriously, Fred, do you honestly
doubt she's guilty?

01:05:16.254 --> 01:05:19.212
So, okay, who would like to dance?

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.126
- Yes.
- Yes. Good.

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:25.301
[clears throat]

01:05:25.304 --> 01:05:26.885
Mmm.

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:28.470
[playing piano]

01:05:28.474 --> 01:05:33.218
# Upon the field of Gettysburg #

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:37.017
# when morning shone again... #

01:05:37.024 --> 01:05:38.480
Dance?

01:05:38.484 --> 01:05:40.145
It's more like a wake.

01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:42.690
I suppose I should have dressed
more like Mrs. Surratt.

01:05:42.697 --> 01:05:44.358
Heh.

01:05:44.365 --> 01:05:45.775
# In streams of fiery rain... #

01:05:45.783 --> 01:05:47.023
Fred, what are you doing?

01:05:47.034 --> 01:05:50.322
I'm enduring the pain
of having to listen to Baker.

01:05:50.329 --> 01:05:51.535
You know what I mean.

01:05:52.665 --> 01:05:55.031
If she's found guilty,
they'll say you weren't up to the task.

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:58.289
And God forbid you prevail.

01:05:58.296 --> 01:06:01.379
They'll think you just as much
a traitor as she.

01:06:01.382 --> 01:06:04.715
Baker, how 'bout something
a little happier?

01:06:04.719 --> 01:06:06.505
# and un...

01:06:06.512 --> 01:06:07.752
- Little happier?
- Yeah.

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:10.676
All right, Fred.
Happier, he wants.

01:06:10.683 --> 01:06:12.014
Eh...

01:06:12.018 --> 01:06:14.384
[playing new song]

01:06:18.357 --> 01:06:20.063
William's right, you know.

01:06:20.067 --> 01:06:22.399
Either outcome, you cannot prevail.

01:06:22.403 --> 01:06:23.859
Sarah.

01:06:23.863 --> 01:06:27.697
What is it about Mary Surratt
you find so compelling?

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:31.409
These are criminal,
despicable people, Fred.

01:06:31.412 --> 01:06:32.697
They're... they're
the same sort of people

01:06:32.705 --> 01:06:34.696
you risked your life
fighting against,

01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:36.868
and she helped kill
your commander in chief.

01:06:36.876 --> 01:06:38.787
I don't know what she's guilty of.

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:45.381
May I ask you one more thing?

01:06:45.384 --> 01:06:47.500
What is it, Sarah?

01:06:47.512 --> 01:06:50.470
Does the captain
remember how to dance?

01:06:54.894 --> 01:06:55.883
Of course.

01:07:00.066 --> 01:07:03.900
SEN. JOHNSON: Few people
will forget what side you fought on.

01:07:03.903 --> 01:07:04.938
[toilet flushes]

01:07:04.946 --> 01:07:07.813
Trust me. It can be lonely.

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:09.906
I'm just upholding my oath
as an attorney

01:07:09.909 --> 01:07:11.991
and doing my job.
It's what you ask ed.

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.859
It's what you told me to do.

01:07:13.871 --> 01:07:17.238
This habit of quoting me back to me
could become most irritating.

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:20.708
You have your mother's convictions
and your father's annoying habits.

01:07:20.711 --> 01:07:23.919
Well, "Mary Surratt is entitled
to a defense, Freddie,

01:07:23.923 --> 01:07:25.663
so I shall defend her."

01:07:27.969 --> 01:07:32.463
If they want John Surratt,

01:07:33.641 --> 01:07:36.257
then you should serve him up
on a platter.

01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:41.730
I... I don't mean, uh, physically.
I mean in spirit.

01:07:41.732 --> 01:07:44.189
You have to prove to the Commission

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:47.230
that he is responsible, not her.

01:07:47.238 --> 01:07:49.103
[sighs]

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:50.779
She's not gonna like that.

01:07:51.951 --> 01:07:54.363
Mr. Lloyd, you are a tenant
of Mary Surratt, are you not?

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.450
Yes, sir.

01:07:55.454 --> 01:07:57.945
I run a tavern some 10 miles
from the city

01:07:57.957 --> 01:08:00.619
on a property she owns.

01:08:00.626 --> 01:08:04.915
And on the afternoon
that President Lincoln was assassinated,

01:08:04.922 --> 01:08:07.254
did Mary Surratt pay you a visit?

01:08:07.258 --> 01:08:11.342
Yes, sir, in the company
of Louis Weichmann.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:17.680
And she brought you a package,
did she not?

01:08:17.685 --> 01:08:19.140
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.

01:08:19.145 --> 01:08:21.010
Small pack age
wrapped in newspaper.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.892
Did she tell you where
the package came from?

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:30.316
Said it came from
John Wilkes Booth.

01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:32.154
[crowd gasping]

01:08:32.158 --> 01:08:33.988
John Wilkes Booth!

01:08:35.995 --> 01:08:36.904
And what exactly did she give you?

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.368
AIKEN: Objection.

01:08:38.372 --> 01:08:40.783
There's no way the defendant
could have known what was inside.

01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:42.497
He just testified the package
was wrapped.

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.158
Overruled.

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:45.831
Witness will answer the question.

01:08:46.964 --> 01:08:50.957
Mr. Lloyd, what was inside the package?

01:08:50.968 --> 01:08:52.332
Field glasses, sir.

01:08:52.345 --> 01:08:53.551
Field glasses?

01:08:53.554 --> 01:08:54.885
Field glasses like these?

01:08:54.889 --> 01:08:56.095
Exactly.

01:08:56.098 --> 01:09:00.466
With the initials "J.W. B."
inscribed on them.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.511
Did she give you any instructions?

01:09:05.566 --> 01:09:07.055
Sir?

01:09:07.068 --> 01:09:09.184
Instructions, Mr. Lloyd?

01:09:09.194 --> 01:09:11.685
Instructions which may affect this trial?

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.861
Oh. Yes, sir.

01:09:15.868 --> 01:09:17.483
Ahem. She told me,

01:09:17.495 --> 01:09:20.703
"Lloyd, get those
shootin' irons ready.

01:09:20.706 --> 01:09:24.243
There will be parties here tonight
who will call for them."

01:09:24.251 --> 01:09:25.286
You liar!

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:26.328
GEN. HUNTER: Order!

01:09:26.337 --> 01:09:27.452
- He's a liar!
- Order!

01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:28.542
- It's a lie.
- Order!

01:09:28.546 --> 01:09:29.877
[crowd murmuring]

01:09:30.758 --> 01:09:32.622
Control yourself, madam.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:36.046
Such outbursts will only
prejudice your case.

01:09:36.055 --> 01:09:38.296
Oh, Lord.

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:43.100
I just don't see how I could possibly
further prejudice this case, sir.

01:09:43.104 --> 01:09:46.470
Counselor,
you will control your client.

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:48.063
General.

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.649
[indistinct whispering]

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.234
Shooting irons!

01:09:53.072 --> 01:09:54.437
Shooting irons.

01:09:54.448 --> 01:09:56.439
And to what was she referring?

01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:57.860
Army rifles, sir,

01:09:57.868 --> 01:10:00.951
hidden in the joist
above the dining room.

01:10:00.955 --> 01:10:02.445
And what else did she tell you?

01:10:02.456 --> 01:10:05.948
She said I was to get two bottles
of whiskey ready, too.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.622
[crowd murmuring]

01:10:08.629 --> 01:10:11.041
And were these things called for,

01:10:11.048 --> 01:10:13.039
as per the defendant's instructions?

01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:14.039
Yes, sir.

01:10:14.051 --> 01:10:15.382
About midnight, sir,

01:10:15.386 --> 01:10:17.217
the night of the assassination,

01:10:17.221 --> 01:10:20.384
by two men on horses, one...

01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:22.719
I'd seen before.

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:28.104
T'other was a stranger to me.

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:33.689
I brought the items, thinking these
were the parties Mrs. Surratt meant.

01:10:50.755 --> 01:10:52.291
LLOYD:
Two of 'em rode off so fast,

01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:56.337
they could have outrun Creation
and give it two-mile a start.

01:10:56.343 --> 01:10:59.210
[laughter]

01:10:59.638 --> 01:11:00.753
Your witness.

01:11:02.933 --> 01:11:04.423
I did not...

01:11:04.435 --> 01:11:05.766
[both whisper]

01:11:07.354 --> 01:11:08.639
Mr. Lloyd.

01:11:13.944 --> 01:11:15.775
Mr. Lloyd, you just testified

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.238
that Louis Weichmann accompanied
the defendant that afternoon.

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:20.481
Right.

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:22.533
So then I can correctly assume

01:11:22.536 --> 01:11:26.199
that he would also testify
to having heard her instructions to you.

01:11:26.207 --> 01:11:27.743
No.

01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:31.162
She took me out by the woodpile
out of earshot.

01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:35.083
So you're saying that nobody
heard this conversation,

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:36.456
just you and her.

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:38.544
Way it happened, sir.

01:11:39.345 --> 01:11:40.380
Of course it is.

01:11:41.472 --> 01:11:42.257
Of course it is.

01:11:43.808 --> 01:11:47.972
When did you learn of President Lincoln's
assassination?

01:11:48.354 --> 01:11:50.310
Well, who can forget when they heard?

01:11:50.314 --> 01:11:53.977
The next morning,
a Captain Cottingham told me.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:57.610
He was searching for the assassins.

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.478
No doubt, you were most upset.

01:12:00.366 --> 01:12:01.276
Indeed.

01:12:01.992 --> 01:12:04.404
I got myself right smart in liquor.

01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:05.901
[laughter]

01:12:06.872 --> 01:12:09.864
Yes, you're... you're right smart
in liquor most days,

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:11.081
- aren't you, Mr. Lloyd?
- Objection.

01:12:11.085 --> 01:12:13.701
I fact, I hear that you're
your own best customer.

01:12:13.712 --> 01:12:14.747
- Objection.
- [laughter]

01:12:14.755 --> 01:12:16.837
Sustained.

01:12:17.925 --> 01:12:20.382
This Captain Cottingham,

01:12:20.386 --> 01:12:24.550
did he ask you anything in reference
to the assassins?

01:12:25.933 --> 01:12:28.265
He asked if any parties
had passed through.

01:12:28.269 --> 01:12:30.476
Naturally I told him
about the two I knew.

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:32.561
Actually, you did not.

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:39.192
According to this witness report,

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:42.529
you said nothing for two days.

01:12:42.533 --> 01:12:43.943
I was frightened is all.

01:12:44.743 --> 01:12:47.200
I feared the assassins
might come for me.

01:12:47.204 --> 01:12:49.695
Perhaps, though, you were afraid
that the authorities

01:12:49.707 --> 01:12:52.039
might consider you an accessory.

01:12:52.042 --> 01:12:56.627
Well, it was through the Surratts
that I got myself in such difficulty.

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:57.870
The Surratts.

01:12:57.882 --> 01:13:00.749
Don't you mean John Surratt,
to be more precise?

01:13:02.052 --> 01:13:03.383
Wasn't it he who brought
the shooting irons

01:13:03.387 --> 01:13:05.753
to your tavern door
in the first place?

01:13:05.764 --> 01:13:06.799
Yeah.

01:13:06.807 --> 01:13:08.638
And he showed you
where to hide them?

01:13:08.642 --> 01:13:10.007
I didn't want to.

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:13.261
So you're saying that he asked you,

01:13:13.272 --> 01:13:15.888
forced you to do so against your will.

01:13:18.068 --> 01:13:18.932
Yes.

01:13:18.944 --> 01:13:21.560
So he brought them to you,

01:13:22.239 --> 01:13:23.945
he showed you where to hide them,

01:13:23.949 --> 01:13:26.656
and he forced you to hide them
against your will?

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.367
That's right. Yes, exactly.

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:32.492
If John Surratt was capable

01:13:32.499 --> 01:13:34.831
of putting Mr. Lloyd,
Louis Weichmann

01:13:34.835 --> 01:13:36.416
and Lord knows
how many others at risk,

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.411
who's to say he didn't do
the same to his mother?

01:13:38.422 --> 01:13:39.628
- Objection.
- Stop this!

01:13:39.632 --> 01:13:41.748
- Sir, it seems the...
- Stop it right now, Mr. Aiken.

01:13:41.759 --> 01:13:43.249
- It seems the only thing...
- Objection.

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.421
- General, objection.
- that Mary Surratt might be guilty of

01:13:45.429 --> 01:13:48.842
- is having given birth to her son John.
- How dare you?

01:13:48.849 --> 01:13:51.431
Objection sustained.
That will be all, Mr. Aiken.

01:13:57.483 --> 01:13:59.098
HOLT: Just to be clear, Mr. Lloyd,

01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:01.100
it was the defendant, Mary Surratt,

01:14:01.111 --> 01:14:03.352
who just hours before
the assassination

01:14:03.364 --> 01:14:04.820
brought you field glasses

01:14:04.823 --> 01:14:08.486
and instructed you to prepare rifles
and two bottles of whiskey?

01:14:11.121 --> 01:14:12.110
Yeah.

01:14:12.122 --> 01:14:13.157
Thank you.

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:16.290
General Hunter,

01:14:16.293 --> 01:14:18.534
members of the Commission,

01:14:18.545 --> 01:14:22.458
the government rests its case
against Mary Surratt.

01:14:22.466 --> 01:14:25.629
That'll be all, Mr. Lloyd.
You may step down.

01:14:28.639 --> 01:14:31.051
What did they promise you
to say that, Mr. Lloyd?

01:14:31.058 --> 01:14:32.389
Counselor, I'm warning you.

01:14:32.393 --> 01:14:35.385
Bet a case of whiskey's all it took.

01:14:35.396 --> 01:14:37.808
You best hush up.
I'll put you in the ground, boy.

01:14:37.815 --> 01:14:40.056
GEN. HUNTER:
Mr. Aiken, you will sit down, sir.

01:14:40.067 --> 01:14:41.523
LLOYD: You shut him up.

01:14:41.527 --> 01:14:43.017
Sit down, sir.

01:14:50.995 --> 01:14:51.905
Now...

01:14:53.664 --> 01:14:54.744
we will adjourn.

01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:56.496
When we resume,

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.456
the defense may call its first witness.

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.702
[bangs gavel]

01:15:09.096 --> 01:15:11.212
Left. Left.

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:16.600
[coughs]

01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:21.431
Excuse me, sirs.

01:15:21.442 --> 01:15:22.602
Uh, Captain Cottingham?

01:15:23.277 --> 01:15:24.312
Yes.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.935
Can I have a word with you, please?

01:15:27.614 --> 01:15:28.603
Sir.

01:15:29.366 --> 01:15:30.947
And did you interview John Lloyd,

01:15:31.535 --> 01:15:34.322
the man who runs the tavern
on Mrs. Surratt's property?

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:35.866
Yes, right after the assassination.

01:15:35.873 --> 01:15:40.242
And did he tell you that Mrs. Surratt

01:15:40.252 --> 01:15:41.617
asked for rifles and whiskey?

01:15:42.796 --> 01:15:45.913
Yes. Lloyd said Mrs. Surratt asked him
to do all those things.

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:50.630
Uh, excuse me?

01:15:50.637 --> 01:15:52.218
[crowd murmuring]

01:15:52.222 --> 01:15:55.430
Did we not talk just yesterday?

01:15:55.434 --> 01:15:56.549
We did.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.221
And did you not say

01:15:58.228 --> 01:16:02.722
that Mrs. Surratt never asked for whiskey
or rifles of John Lloyd?

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.061
I do not deny that.

01:16:05.819 --> 01:16:06.979
And now you're swearing,

01:16:06.987 --> 01:16:09.694
under oath,
that what you told me then was a lie.

01:16:10.157 --> 01:16:14.116
Yes. I lied to you 'cause I thought
you had no business to ask me.

01:16:14.119 --> 01:16:15.234
No business? I...

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:17.532
You're my witness.

01:16:18.415 --> 01:16:20.076
Should I not expect the truth?

01:16:20.751 --> 01:16:22.742
I state here that I did lie to you,

01:16:22.753 --> 01:16:26.245
but under oath,
now I'm telling the truth.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.751
[sighs]

01:16:32.304 --> 01:16:34.795
GEN. HUNTER: Mr. Holt,
do you wish to question the witness?

01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:37.924
Uh, no. I believe what we've heard
is more than sufficient.

01:16:38.936 --> 01:16:41.302
Captain, you may step down.

01:16:42.356 --> 01:16:44.017
As you know, tonight mark s

01:16:44.024 --> 01:16:47.266
Washington's celebration
honoring our troops,

01:16:47.277 --> 01:16:48.608
so we will adjourn.

01:16:56.412 --> 01:16:58.949
It's not enough, is it, Mr. Holt?

01:16:59.456 --> 01:17:00.946
It's not enough that you, uh...

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:04.121
you set the rules.
You... You pick the judges.

01:17:04.128 --> 01:17:06.335
Now you have to turn
my witness as well.

01:17:06.338 --> 01:17:07.578
Counselor, control yourself.

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.375
Control the prosecution.

01:17:09.383 --> 01:17:10.418
Mr. Aiken.

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:13.714
Every witness I wish to call has either
been turned by jail or the threat of it.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.755
That's enough!

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:17.630
There is no limit to how far
the prosecution is willing to go!

01:17:17.641 --> 01:17:20.428
Stand down, counselor,
or I will hold you in contempt.

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:26.434
You had better comport yourself
in a more appropriate manner,

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:29.434
or you will find yourself
incarcerated with the others.

01:17:31.655 --> 01:17:34.488
[crowd murmuring]

01:17:38.328 --> 01:17:39.909
Good evening.

01:17:43.417 --> 01:17:44.953
Good evening, Douglas.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.040
- Ma'am.
- Good evening.

01:17:46.044 --> 01:17:49.036
Mr. Aiken, may I have
a word with you?

01:17:49.047 --> 01:17:50.753
Of course.
Would you excuse me?

01:17:53.177 --> 01:17:55.008
MAN: His first day on the job.

01:17:55.012 --> 01:17:57.549
[overlapping conversations]

01:17:57.556 --> 01:17:59.547
[indistinct whispering]

01:18:10.027 --> 01:18:11.312
I'm sorry, Mr. Aiken.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.811
It's all right, Douglas.
It's not your fault.

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.312
BAKER: Frederick!

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:18.862
Uh, Nick, would you escort Sarah
upstairs for me, please?

01:18:18.869 --> 01:18:21.360
Sure, but, uh...

01:18:21.371 --> 01:18:23.362
- HAMILTON: Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

01:18:23.749 --> 01:18:25.285
BAKER: Come on, Sarah.

01:18:25.292 --> 01:18:28.375
Even with one good leg,
I can still outdance him.

01:18:28.378 --> 01:18:29.413
Another night, Nick.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.625
Sarah.

01:18:37.888 --> 01:18:39.503
Sarah, where are you going?

01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:41.714
"Conduct unbecoming."

01:18:41.725 --> 01:18:43.215
I'm sorry about the party.

01:18:43.227 --> 01:18:44.512
You think I care about the party?

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.351
Please. Everything will be all right.
I promise you.

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:47.765
You are just like that woman,

01:18:47.773 --> 01:18:51.686
ready to go to the gallows
for the most pointless cause.

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:53.854
People do get left behind
when you do that.

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:55.773
I can't ignore what's going on
in that courtroom.

01:18:55.781 --> 01:18:58.113
But you can ignore me, us?

01:18:58.116 --> 01:18:59.902
I didn't say that.
Please, I have to do this.

01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:00.945
Do you?

01:19:00.953 --> 01:19:04.662
I find your devotion to this frightening.

01:19:04.665 --> 01:19:07.907
I waited such a long time for you.

01:19:07.918 --> 01:19:08.998
I'm so sorry.

01:19:09.002 --> 01:19:11.084
I know. But I'm back now.

01:19:11.088 --> 01:19:13.044
No, you're not.

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.083
I am. I... ple...

01:19:14.091 --> 01:19:15.752
Sarah, please, will you just...

01:19:15.759 --> 01:19:18.091
We have to...
we have to talk about this.

01:19:18.095 --> 01:19:20.882
Fred, I love you. I...

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:23.756
I wish I could do this.
I just... I can't.

01:19:23.767 --> 01:19:25.632
I just can't.

01:19:25.936 --> 01:19:27.597
Wait. Let me see you home at least.

01:19:27.604 --> 01:19:28.764
Please wait.

01:19:38.365 --> 01:19:39.650
Uh, Mr. Secretary.

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:41.694
I have to speak with you.

01:19:41.702 --> 01:19:44.489
Mr. Aiken, perhaps this isn't
the best time.

01:19:44.496 --> 01:19:46.987
What is happening to Mary Surratt
is an abomination.

01:19:46.999 --> 01:19:48.079
Stand down, Captain.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.289
It's all right.

01:19:49.293 --> 01:19:51.284
Would you escort Mrs. Stanton in?

01:19:51.295 --> 01:19:52.956
I'll just be a moment.

01:19:52.963 --> 01:19:53.998
Yes, sir.

01:19:55.382 --> 01:19:56.918
Young man...

01:19:57.676 --> 01:19:59.758
always indebted to you
for your courage in the field,

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:01.376
but you must learn to tread lightly.

01:20:01.388 --> 01:20:02.423
- Tread lightly?
- Mm.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:04.046
I will not tread lightly.

01:20:04.057 --> 01:20:05.922
You have predetermined her fate.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.471
Mary Surratt's fate rests entirely
with the Commission.

01:20:08.478 --> 01:20:10.434
My concern is preserving our Union.

01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:13.806
Why did I fight for the Union
if my rights aren't assured?

01:20:13.817 --> 01:20:14.897
You tell me.

01:20:14.901 --> 01:20:17.267
Fine words for rallying the troops,
not for running a nation.

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:19.361
They assassinated our president,

01:20:19.364 --> 01:20:21.650
and someone must be
held accountable.

01:20:21.658 --> 01:20:23.489
The people want that.

01:20:23.493 --> 01:20:26.109
It's John Surratt you want.
You don't even want Mary.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.201
I'll settle for either one.

01:20:27.205 --> 01:20:29.491
If you'll excuse me,
my wife is waiting.

01:20:37.382 --> 01:20:39.418
[laughter]

01:21:11.458 --> 01:21:13.449
[overlapping conversations]

01:21:21.635 --> 01:21:22.715
[coins clink]

01:21:24.721 --> 01:21:26.052
Mr. Aiken.

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:27.675
May I come in?

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:29.014
- It's late.
- I know.

01:21:37.901 --> 01:21:40.142
I need you to testify.

01:21:41.446 --> 01:21:42.686
Very well.

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:45.189
I'll tell them my mother's innocent.

01:21:45.992 --> 01:21:48.574
I need you to tell them
that your brother is not.

01:21:48.578 --> 01:21:51.035
I won't do it.

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.872
You know what'll happen
to her if you don't?

01:21:57.129 --> 01:21:58.539
Anna...

01:21:59.339 --> 01:22:01.921
Your brother does not need
to be saved right now.

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:03.666
Your mother does.

01:22:09.433 --> 01:22:10.969
GEN. HUNTER: Mr. Aiken,

01:22:10.976 --> 01:22:13.183
are there any other
witnesses you wish to call?

01:22:13.186 --> 01:22:16.144
Uh, yes.

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:19.060
The... The defense

01:22:19.609 --> 01:22:22.772
would like to call Miss Anna Surratt.

01:22:22.779 --> 01:22:24.644
[crowd murmuring]

01:22:29.161 --> 01:22:30.742
General Hunter, what is...

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:39.577
Place your right hand on this Bible.

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:40.577
Where's my mother?

01:22:40.589 --> 01:22:41.999
Anna, she's just right here,

01:22:42.007 --> 01:22:43.838
behind these men.

01:22:43.842 --> 01:22:45.798
Why won't they let me see her?

01:22:45.802 --> 01:22:47.087
I don't know.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:50.007
Please, Miss Surratt.

01:22:54.895 --> 01:22:56.385
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

01:22:56.396 --> 01:22:58.307
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

01:23:01.318 --> 01:23:02.353
Miss Anna.

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:05.773
I do.

01:23:12.329 --> 01:23:13.318
It'll be all right.

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:17.076
Miss Surratt, can you tell us

01:23:17.083 --> 01:23:20.496
when your brother first became acquainted
with John Wilkes Booth?

01:23:26.802 --> 01:23:29.544
Miss Surratt, you will
answer the question.

01:23:31.014 --> 01:23:35.132
I believe my brother
met him January last.

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.680
Three months before
the assassination.

01:23:37.687 --> 01:23:41.475
He must have been mighty pleased
to have befriended such a famous actor.

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:43.898
You'll have to ask him.

01:23:43.902 --> 01:23:45.642
AIKEN: Well, I'm sure
we'd all like to ask him.

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:51.652
Your brother proudly called himself
a friend of Booth's, did he not?

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:52.490
Mr. Aiken, what are you doing?

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:53.529
- [gavel bangs]
- Mother!

01:23:53.537 --> 01:23:54.947
Miss Surratt.
Miss Surratt, please.

01:23:56.706 --> 01:23:57.741
Miss Surratt.

01:23:59.751 --> 01:24:00.786
I never...

01:24:00.794 --> 01:24:04.662
asked what my brother's
relationship was to Booth.

01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:07.005
It was at John's invitation

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:09.169
that he first came to your home,
was it not?

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:11.338
Yes.

01:24:18.103 --> 01:24:20.059
Does this picture of Booth
belong to you?

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:26.984
I found it in a gallery one day,
and I bought it.

01:24:29.114 --> 01:24:32.447
Your brother must have been pleased that
you held his friend in such high regard.

01:24:32.826 --> 01:24:34.908
- No.
- No?

01:24:35.829 --> 01:24:38.536
No. He told me to tear it up
and throw it away.

01:24:38.832 --> 01:24:39.617
Why?

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.823
Why did your brother
tell you to destroy

01:24:41.835 --> 01:24:43.450
a photograph of his friend, Booth?

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:45.251
No, Mr. Aiken!

01:24:45.255 --> 01:24:46.586
- AIKEN: Please.
- I beg of you.

01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:47.921
- Please.
GEN. HUNTER: Order!

01:24:47.924 --> 01:24:48.913
Miss Surratt, please.

01:24:49.843 --> 01:24:50.878
Answer my question.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.296
I suppose he was trying to protect us.

01:24:56.308 --> 01:24:58.890
He was trying to protect
you and your mother?

01:24:59.477 --> 01:25:00.933
Yes.

01:25:00.937 --> 01:25:03.519
Why would he need
to protect his family?

01:25:08.486 --> 01:25:09.942
Anna, you have to choose.

01:25:15.702 --> 01:25:16.862
I suppose...

01:25:18.204 --> 01:25:20.445
he and Booth
were planning something.

01:25:20.457 --> 01:25:21.993
[crowd murmuring]

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.331
He was planning something.

01:25:24.836 --> 01:25:26.576
Did you know what?

01:25:27.547 --> 01:25:29.503
Of course not.

01:25:29.507 --> 01:25:31.293
When did you last see your brother?

01:25:31.885 --> 01:25:34.752
He left at the beginning of April.

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:36.719
Days before the assassination.

01:25:36.723 --> 01:25:39.214
Did he tell you where he was going
or what he might be planning?

01:25:39.225 --> 01:25:41.056
He only said he had to leave.

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.098
And did you or your mother
try to stop him?

01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:46.846
Yes.

01:25:48.068 --> 01:25:51.936
- But we couldn't.
- How could you? He was angry.

01:25:51.947 --> 01:25:53.608
He was frustrated with the war.

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:54.730
He hated the Union.

01:25:54.741 --> 01:25:57.107
He would have done
anything in his power,

01:25:57.118 --> 01:26:00.281
even risk his own family
to aid Booth in his cause.

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:04.247
But, Miss Surratt, did your mother conspire
with John Wilkes Booth?

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.115
Absolutely not.

01:26:08.213 --> 01:26:10.204
Thank you.

01:26:10.757 --> 01:26:11.917
There are no more questions.

01:26:15.679 --> 01:26:17.135
General Hunter,
the government understands

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:19.129
why Miss Surratt would be moved

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.883
to the most extraordinary lengths
to conceal her mother's guilt,

01:26:22.894 --> 01:26:26.352
including incriminating
her own brother.

01:26:26.356 --> 01:26:28.642
My mother is innocent.

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:31.016
GEN. HUNTER:
Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.

01:26:31.027 --> 01:26:31.857
The government no longer
deems it necessary to hold you.

01:26:33.279 --> 01:26:34.268
You are free to leave.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.816
I just want to see my mother.

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:39.282
Please. I'm sorry, mother.

01:26:39.285 --> 01:26:40.866
I'm sorry.

01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:44.078
Please.
Please, let me see her.

01:26:47.836 --> 01:26:50.953
Sir, the defense would push
for the Commission

01:26:50.964 --> 01:26:52.955
to show some compassion
and allow a mother

01:26:52.966 --> 01:26:55.958
to see her daughter
for a brief moment only.

01:26:58.555 --> 01:26:59.590
Mm-hmm.

01:26:59.597 --> 01:27:02.009
We will reconvene in the morning.

01:27:34.799 --> 01:27:35.834
Unh!

01:27:35.842 --> 01:27:37.924
Frederick, it's me.

01:27:37.927 --> 01:27:39.963
Anna.

01:27:39.971 --> 01:27:41.632
What are you doing here?

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:48.556
You never asked why
I had Booth's photo.

01:27:52.275 --> 01:27:54.231
Tear that up and throw it away.

01:27:54.527 --> 01:27:57.769
That man is gonna get us all
in trouble, if not worse.

01:28:05.455 --> 01:28:07.116
I should have thrown it away,

01:28:07.123 --> 01:28:08.863
but I didn't.

01:28:18.093 --> 01:28:21.256
So you were infatuated with Booth.

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:25.422
I swear I didn't know
what he was capable of.

01:28:26.017 --> 01:28:29.350
I believe you.
But your brother did.

01:28:31.147 --> 01:28:33.354
Can you save my mother without him?

01:28:33.358 --> 01:28:35.349
Can you, Frederick?

01:28:38.738 --> 01:28:39.773
Probably not.

01:28:46.913 --> 01:28:48.119
AIKEN: Father Walter!

01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:51.538
Father?

01:28:51.543 --> 01:28:52.783
[laughs]

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.961
Will you excuse us for a minute?

01:28:58.216 --> 01:28:59.251
Counselor.

01:28:59.259 --> 01:29:01.796
I need to see John Surratt right away.

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:05.386
Anna Surratt sent me.

01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:09.053
Well, as I told Miss Surratt,
I can only pass along a message.

01:29:09.519 --> 01:29:10.679
Where is he?

01:29:12.272 --> 01:29:13.136
I don't know.

01:29:14.107 --> 01:29:17.065
Only that some in the church have chosen
to provide him sanctuary.

01:29:17.068 --> 01:29:19.354
You don't seem troubled by their choice.

01:29:19.362 --> 01:29:22.604
You prefer he be crucified by this mob?

01:29:22.615 --> 01:29:24.731
John is hardly the Prince of Peace.

01:29:24.742 --> 01:29:26.573
He's wanted for murder and treason.

01:29:26.578 --> 01:29:29.490
Harboring him is not only immoral,
Father, it's illegal.

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:33.661
Our laws are written here, counselor,
our allegiance to God.

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:34.407
You forgive me, Father,

01:29:34.419 --> 01:29:36.831
but that's a bunch
of cock and bull.

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:39.580
Bible bears as many interpretations
as anything else.

01:29:40.633 --> 01:29:43.340
Is there a message
you wish me to pass along?

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:44.800
My case summary is tomorrow,

01:29:44.804 --> 01:29:45.964
so you tell John Surratt

01:29:45.972 --> 01:29:47.303
that unless he surrenders himself,

01:29:47.307 --> 01:29:50.845
his mother will most likely be
punished for his crimes.

01:29:55.565 --> 01:29:57.021
GEN. HUNTER: Mr. Aiken.

01:30:09.829 --> 01:30:12.696
F or the lawyer as well as the soldier,

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:16.199
there is an equally imperative command.

01:30:16.211 --> 01:30:20.830
That duty is to shelter from injustice
the innocent,

01:30:21.674 --> 01:30:24.086
to protect the weak from oppression

01:30:24.093 --> 01:30:26.175
and, when necessity demands,

01:30:26.179 --> 01:30:30.798
to rally to the defense
of those being wronged.

01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:37.517
After the most thorough investigation
in our nation's history,

01:30:37.523 --> 01:30:40.390
the government's entire case
against Mary Surratt

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.390
rests on three acts...

01:30:41.861 --> 01:30:44.147
one,
her acquaintance with Booth,

01:30:44.155 --> 01:30:46.771
two,
her alleged instructions to Lloyd,

01:30:46.783 --> 01:30:50.196
and, three,
her nonrecognition of Payne.

01:30:50.203 --> 01:30:54.446
It is these three acts
that constitute the sum total

01:30:54.457 --> 01:30:59.747
of Mary Surratt's part in this traitorous
and murderous conspiracy.

01:31:00.672 --> 01:31:03.414
By themselves,
they constitute no crime.

01:31:04.342 --> 01:31:06.378
Any one of you or I
might have done the same,

01:31:06.386 --> 01:31:10.220
but the government insists
she did them with evil intent,

01:31:11.015 --> 01:31:12.926
largely based on the testimony of two men,

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:15.050
John Lloyd
and Louis Weichmann.

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:20.055
Yet, at best, the actions of these men
undermine their credibility,

01:31:20.066 --> 01:31:23.229
and, at worst,
they have done the unspeakable...

01:31:23.236 --> 01:31:25.227
they have gained their freedom

01:31:25.238 --> 01:31:28.730
by falsely accusing another
of their crime.

01:31:29.909 --> 01:31:33.697
There can be no doubt as
to the principal and real reason

01:31:33.705 --> 01:31:35.661
that Mary Surratt is here today.

01:31:35.665 --> 01:31:37.906
It's because of her son, John Surratt.

01:31:39.043 --> 01:31:41.580
He invited Booth into her home.
She did not.

01:31:41.587 --> 01:31:45.000
And he hid rifles and ammunition
in Lloyd's Tavern.

01:31:45.008 --> 01:31:46.464
She did not.

01:31:47.552 --> 01:31:49.668
If John Surratt was part
of this conspiracy,

01:31:49.679 --> 01:31:52.421
I pray to God that he receives
every punishment known to man,

01:31:52.432 --> 01:31:56.675
but if his mother can be convicted
on such insufficient evidence,

01:31:56.686 --> 01:31:59.393
I tell you none of you are safe.

01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:03.723
Members of the Commission,

01:32:04.444 --> 01:32:07.811
do not permit this injustice
to Mary Surratt

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:11.610
by sacrificing our sacred rights
out of revenge.

01:32:12.785 --> 01:32:16.073
Too many of us have laid down
our lives to preserve them.

01:32:27.175 --> 01:32:28.631
HOLT: Gentlemen.

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.630
Gentlemen.

01:32:35.475 --> 01:32:40.139
One bullet may have killed
our beloved president.

01:32:40.146 --> 01:32:44.936
One bullet, but not one man.

01:32:45.902 --> 01:32:46.937
[door creak s]

01:32:52.075 --> 01:32:53.485
[keys jingle]

01:32:54.118 --> 01:32:55.483
Sit with me.

01:33:05.838 --> 01:33:06.873
Is there any word?

01:33:08.966 --> 01:33:11.252
No. They're still deliberating.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.842
I mean about my son.

01:33:16.808 --> 01:33:18.344
I held him too close.

01:33:22.605 --> 01:33:24.846
I didn't want John turning out
like his father,

01:33:24.857 --> 01:33:26.097
so I kept him near.

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:33.234
And when the war broke out,
he wanted to enlist,

01:33:34.617 --> 01:33:35.652
but I wouldn't let him.

01:33:38.329 --> 01:33:42.163
My son just needed to break free...

01:33:44.293 --> 01:33:45.328
be his own man.

01:33:47.797 --> 01:33:50.459
And this is the way he did it.

01:33:57.348 --> 01:33:58.679
GEN. HUNTER:
All those in favor?

01:33:59.809 --> 01:34:01.424
Aye.

01:34:03.521 --> 01:34:06.604
Well, then, we are all agreed

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:09.394
on the penalty of death
for the prisoners

01:34:09.402 --> 01:34:12.189
Herold, Atzerodt and Payne.

01:34:15.199 --> 01:34:16.564
What about the woman?

01:34:21.706 --> 01:34:23.947
Regarding Mary Surratt,

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.991
all those in favor, gentlemen?

01:34:44.103 --> 01:34:45.092
No.

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:48.016
Damn it!

01:34:48.024 --> 01:34:49.230
No.

01:34:52.069 --> 01:34:54.151
No, she must be punished
to the full extent.

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:56.567
I want these people
buried and forgotten.

01:34:56.574 --> 01:35:00.908
The majority prefer
a more merciful sentence,

01:35:02.246 --> 01:35:06.239
life in prison
on account of her age, gender.

01:35:06.751 --> 01:35:07.911
I give Mr. Aiken credit.

01:35:07.919 --> 01:35:10.581
He knew just how
to use the daughter.

01:35:10.588 --> 01:35:11.748
It seems so.

01:35:11.756 --> 01:35:15.669
You made my sentiments known
to the Commission?

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:18.213
Their minds are made.

01:35:22.642 --> 01:35:24.007
Then let us change them.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.443
"After mature consideration
of the evidence,

01:35:40.284 --> 01:35:43.026

Here, sir.

01:36:59.655 --> 01:37:01.145
[sawing]

01:37:08.164 --> 01:37:10.530
There must be something we can do.

01:37:10.541 --> 01:37:11.781
You have three options:

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:14.283
Petition the president
for a stay of execution...

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.876
but, uh, he won't do that,

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.711
because if he did,
people would think

01:37:17.715 --> 01:37:19.330
he was part of the conspiracy.

01:37:19.342 --> 01:37:22.800
Uh, two, apply for
a writ of habeas corpus

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:24.339
to retry her in a civilian court,

01:37:24.347 --> 01:37:26.303
but no judge would oppose Stanton

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:28.639
or the might of the War Department.

01:37:28.643 --> 01:37:32.352
Uh, and, three, John Surratt

01:37:32.355 --> 01:37:35.142
shows himself before noon tomorrow.

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:36.980
Are you going somewhere?

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:39.225
I have business in Baltimore.

01:37:39.236 --> 01:37:40.271
What?

01:37:40.279 --> 01:37:42.235
You... You can't leave now!

01:37:44.075 --> 01:37:45.235
It's over.

01:37:48.496 --> 01:37:51.738
Freddie, she's not your mother.

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:55.575
If John Surratt won't
give himself up for her,

01:37:56.337 --> 01:37:57.292
then why should you?

01:38:02.927 --> 01:38:04.007
[knocking on door]

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:06.047
BAKER: Freddie!

01:38:06.055 --> 01:38:08.967
Frederick Sebastian Aiken,
we know you're in there!

01:38:08.974 --> 01:38:11.556
Open the door now. Come on.

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.892
Fred... ah, there he is.

01:38:13.896 --> 01:38:17.138
Well, if it isn't
the reclusive Master Aiken.

01:38:17.983 --> 01:38:19.314
We thought you could use this.

01:38:20.611 --> 01:38:22.442
Hamilton, how well
do you know Judge Olin?

01:38:23.572 --> 01:38:24.607
What are you doing?

01:38:24.615 --> 01:38:26.446
You think he'll give me
a writ of habeas corpus?

01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:27.860
You can't pursue a writ.

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:29.449
They won't allow me
to appeal this verdict,

01:38:29.453 --> 01:38:30.989
so I'm gonna appeal for a new trial.

01:38:30.996 --> 01:38:32.577
If you do this,
you will humiliate Stanton,

01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:34.037
and he will destroy you.

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:35.531
The hell with Stanton.

01:38:35.543 --> 01:38:38.455
Why do you... Why do you insist
on standing by her?

01:38:38.462 --> 01:38:40.202
Hey. Hey, it makes no sense.

01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:42.921
What they're doing to her is wrong.

01:38:42.925 --> 01:38:45.507
If John Wilkes Booth himself
was tried in the same manner,

01:38:45.511 --> 01:38:47.877
it would still be wrong.

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:52.382
Hamilton, she's to hang
in less than 12 hours.

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:55.142
Judge Olin's out of town.

01:38:55.146 --> 01:38:56.807
He would have been my first choice.

01:38:56.814 --> 01:38:57.974
What about Wylie?

01:38:57.982 --> 01:38:59.392
Maybe Wylie.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.312
He's, uh- -he's always been known
as a Free Thinker.

01:39:02.319 --> 01:39:05.482
Yes. He's been around for ages,
but he was the closest to Lincoln.

01:39:05.489 --> 01:39:06.399
Then what about Carter?

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:09.820
Not a chance. He was with Stanton
on the night of the assassination.

01:39:09.827 --> 01:39:11.783
Besides, they have dinner
together once a week.

01:39:11.787 --> 01:39:14.073
Then you're saying that Wylie
is my best option.

01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:16.663
No. Your best option is
to stop this nonsense

01:39:16.667 --> 01:39:18.373
and help us empty this bottle.

01:39:18.377 --> 01:39:20.038
Better listen to the man.

01:39:24.467 --> 01:39:27.379
[hammering]

01:39:30.514 --> 01:39:31.879
[pounding on door]

01:39:35.853 --> 01:39:36.888
Judge Wylie?

01:39:37.605 --> 01:39:41.063
I, uh... I need to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus.

01:39:41.901 --> 01:39:43.607
At this hour of the night?

01:39:43.611 --> 01:39:45.021
I'm sorry, sir. It can't wait.

01:39:45.029 --> 01:39:47.395
Interrupting an old man's sleep?

01:39:47.406 --> 01:39:50.569
I'd say you're getting off
on the wrong foot, son.

01:39:50.576 --> 01:39:51.861
It's for Mary Surratt.

01:40:05.257 --> 01:40:06.292
A new trial...

01:40:07.384 --> 01:40:11.093
in a civil court
by a jury of her peers.

01:40:11.096 --> 01:40:12.632
Is that what you want, Mr. Aiken?

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.130
Yes, please, Your Honor.

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:18.054
So we can relive our president's
assassination all over again.

01:40:18.062 --> 01:40:19.051
That's not my intention.

01:40:19.063 --> 01:40:20.678
Then to what intent?

01:40:21.816 --> 01:40:24.558
Might this not result
in exactly the same thing?

01:40:24.568 --> 01:40:28.652
Perhaps, but results should not be
our only measure of justice.

01:40:28.656 --> 01:40:31.147
Are you going
to lecture me on justice?

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:32.193
Sorry, sir.

01:40:32.201 --> 01:40:36.786
You realize that I was personally
appointed by President Lincoln.

01:40:36.789 --> 01:40:37.824
Yes.

01:40:37.832 --> 01:40:40.164
And yet you still come to me.

01:40:41.293 --> 01:40:43.409
Forgive me, Your Honor,

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:48.084
but are we not obligated
to follow the law at all times,

01:40:48.092 --> 01:40:49.707
regardless of our emotions?

01:40:49.718 --> 01:40:51.754
And is this not driven by emotions?

01:40:51.762 --> 01:40:52.922
Isn't that what this is all about?

01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:54.591
It's about preventing injustice.

01:40:55.933 --> 01:40:57.924
Now, I know that the people
are still angry.

01:40:57.935 --> 01:40:59.550
Yes, they are, and so am I.

01:40:59.562 --> 01:41:01.393
But I hope,
I trust that President Lincoln

01:41:01.397 --> 01:41:06.517
appointed you because you hold
the Constitution sacred.

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:09.769
Whether you believe Mary Surratt
is guilty or innocent,

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.270
the Constitution was intended...

01:41:11.282 --> 01:41:12.943
And now you're gonna
lecture me on the Constitution.

01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:16.738
...to protect the rights of all citizens
at all times in peace or war.

01:41:16.745 --> 01:41:18.360
And in a matter of hours,

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:21.864
it will have failed to protect her
unless you sign that writ.

01:41:24.336 --> 01:41:25.701
You believe she's innocent?

01:41:25.713 --> 01:41:28.455
I don't know.

01:41:28.465 --> 01:41:32.299
But if we don't get a proper trial,
we never will.

01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:36.636
MAN:
You can't go in there! Wait!

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.847
I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I tried to stop him.

01:41:44.815 --> 01:41:46.021
It's all right.

01:41:51.947 --> 01:41:52.982
[clears throat]

01:41:56.785 --> 01:41:57.991
Good morning, Joseph.

01:41:57.995 --> 01:41:59.110
Good morning.

01:41:59.121 --> 01:42:03.490
It appears that Mr. Aiken has procured
a writ signed by Judge Wylie.

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.740
Good day.

01:42:04.752 --> 01:42:07.539
Before you go, Captain,

01:42:08.339 --> 01:42:09.374
tell me...

01:42:10.758 --> 01:42:13.750
when you first learned
that our secretary of State

01:42:13.761 --> 01:42:15.297
had been butchered
to within an inch of his life

01:42:15.304 --> 01:42:18.341
and that they put a bullet in the back
of our president's head,

01:42:18.349 --> 01:42:20.055
when this city was in chaos,

01:42:20.059 --> 01:42:23.722
did you not wish to see order restored
and justice served,

01:42:23.729 --> 01:42:28.189
or were you just concerned
with the rights of the assassins?

01:42:28.192 --> 01:42:31.059
It's not justice you're after.
It's revenge.

01:42:32.029 --> 01:42:35.738
I would never go to such lengths
out of vengeance,

01:42:35.741 --> 01:42:40.861
but to ensure the survival of this nation,
I would do anything.

01:42:42.039 --> 01:42:46.874
Mary Surratt was a party
to the most grievous crime in our history.

01:42:46.877 --> 01:42:52.622
Necessity demands that she be given
a swift, sure and harsh sentence.

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:56.922
I, too, hold sacred
our rights, counselor,

01:42:56.929 --> 01:43:02.219
but they count not at all
if our nation ceases to exist.

01:43:03.519 --> 01:43:05.180
Please see to it that Mary Surratt

01:43:05.187 --> 01:43:08.475
is delivered to Judge Wylie's courtroom
no later than noon...

01:43:08.565 --> 01:43:09.554
sir.

01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:21.741
Let's go. Come on. Stay there.

01:43:32.923 --> 01:43:35.005
You will have to stand trial again,

01:43:35.009 --> 01:43:37.751
but it will be a civilian trial.

01:43:37.761 --> 01:43:39.092
And a civilian trial has no generals.

01:43:39.096 --> 01:43:40.427
That's correct. No generals.

01:43:42.433 --> 01:43:43.889
Bless you, son.

01:43:43.892 --> 01:43:45.382
- [laughs]
- Bless you.

01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:51.100
ANNA: Oh, Mama.

01:43:51.108 --> 01:43:52.143
Anna.

01:43:58.115 --> 01:44:00.276
Should only be three.

01:44:00.284 --> 01:44:02.775
[door opens]

01:44:04.747 --> 01:44:05.862
It's time, ma'am.

01:44:07.124 --> 01:44:08.409
What are you doing?

01:44:08.417 --> 01:44:10.123
We need to prepare her
with the others.

01:44:10.127 --> 01:44:13.711
No. No, she is to be transferred
to Judge Wylie's court.

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:16.046
I advise sedating the young lady.

01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:17.506
You'll do no such thing.

01:44:17.509 --> 01:44:21.422
Anna. I have procured a writ
that says she is to get a new trial.

01:44:23.974 --> 01:44:26.056
President just suspended your writ.

01:44:32.024 --> 01:44:33.480
OFFICER: I'm sorry.

01:44:33.484 --> 01:44:35.270
She's to hang with the others.

01:44:35.277 --> 01:44:36.312
No.

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.402
No. Frederick, do something.

01:44:40.074 --> 01:44:42.440
I...

01:44:42.451 --> 01:44:44.612
I'm so sorry.

01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:46.110
Oh, no.

01:44:46.121 --> 01:44:47.611
No. No, no, no, no.

01:44:47.623 --> 01:44:48.954
No, Mama. No.
No, Mama. No.

01:44:48.957 --> 01:44:50.447
I'll always be with you.

01:44:50.459 --> 01:44:53.576
No! No!
Oh, Mama, no!

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:55.873
I love you, Anna.
I love you.

01:44:55.881 --> 01:44:57.246
No!

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:59.339
Oh, God, no!

01:45:00.844 --> 01:45:02.880
Mama!

[door closes]

01:47:57.688 --> 01:47:59.553
I am hereby commanded

01:47:59.564 --> 01:48:01.395
to cause David E. Herold,

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.186
G. A. Atzerodt,

01:48:03.193 --> 01:48:04.933
Lewis Payne

and Mary E. Surratt

01:48:08.657 --> 01:48:10.318
to be executed

01:48:10.325 --> 01:48:13.658
in accordance with the order of
the president of the United States,

01:48:13.662 --> 01:48:14.993
Andrew Johnson.

01:48:25.173 --> 01:48:26.913
The Almighty God bless you.

Stand your prisoners up.

01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:00.654
Okay, sir.
I'll show you where he's at...

01:51:00.662 --> 01:51:01.993
No, I know the way.

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.516
Mr. Aiken.

01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:28.975
I didn't think you'd come.

01:51:28.982 --> 01:51:31.473
I don't know what help
I can be to you.

01:51:32.402 --> 01:51:33.892
I've left the law.

01:51:34.696 --> 01:51:35.811
I just wanted to thank you

01:51:35.822 --> 01:51:38.313
for the kindness
that you showed my mother.

01:51:39.701 --> 01:51:41.532
Believe me, Mr. Aiken,

01:51:41.536 --> 01:51:43.527
I never thought they'd kill her.

01:51:54.674 --> 01:51:57.256
Father Walter asked
that I give you these.

01:51:58.428 --> 01:52:00.168
They were your mother's.

01:52:02.724 --> 01:52:05.807
I hope they can be
of some comfort to you.

01:52:07.771 --> 01:52:09.227
They belong to you.

01:52:11.399 --> 01:52:13.731
You were more of a son to her
than I ever was.

01:52:24.287 --> 01:52:25.367
Thank you.
