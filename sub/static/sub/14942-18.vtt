What'd you say to her?

04:31.302 --> 04:32.572

she looked familiar.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.514
worked at the medical
examiner's office.

I guarantee you,
they will find it.

have been involved with this guy?

She might have got it from him.

(Huffs) I don't
know. I hope not.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.551
So you think he spiked a fever?

05:51.552 --> 05:52.682
It's a theory.

05:52.683 --> 05:54.724
What if it's not a
poison, but an infection?

05:54.725 --> 05:57.356
There'd be a lot
more sick people.

we can honor her

07:53.704 --> 07:55.705

is to do our jobs

07:57.608 --> 07:59.609
and find cause of death.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.680
We need to figure out

where all of our
victims have been,

08:01.852 --> 08:03.583
when they first started
showing symptoms,

08:03.584 --> 08:06.686

who got sick first...

or radioactive rain?

Anything could be...

Ethan, calm down.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.899
Actually, he has a point.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.871
That is not what I
need to hear right now.

08:21.872 --> 08:24.734
We have no idea
what is causing this,

08:24.735 --> 08:26.776
how it's transmitted,
or where it comes from.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.608
What we do know

08:28.609 --> 08:29.839
is our victims.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.811
Everyone of these
people is unique,

08:31.812 --> 08:33.843
and their last
hours are critical.

08:33.844 --> 08:36.616
Couple of air locks,
one here, one here.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.589

08:40.821 --> 08:42.692
Swap this table out.

08:42.693 --> 08:43.853
Hey! Hey!

08:43.854 --> 08:45.795
Nobody's swapping out
anything without my approval.

08:45.796 --> 08:46.896
(Kate) Curtis.

08:46.897 --> 08:48.858
I'm Dr. Kate Murphy.

08:48.859 --> 08:50.800
Introductions. Sorry.

08:50.801 --> 08:52.832
Rude.

08:52.833 --> 08:53.963
Very rude.

08:53.964 --> 08:56.606
Dr. Charlie Stafford,
centers for disease control.

08:56.607 --> 08:57.867
I'm Dr. Megan hunt.

08:57.868 --> 09:00.740
Yes, you are.
Brian surgeon. Nice.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.872
Oh, sorry. I haven't had a
chance to Google you yet.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.714
Good things come
to those who wait.

09:04.715 --> 09:05.815
Thank you for your hard work.

09:05.816 --> 09:07.617
We set up
decontamination outside.

09:07.618 --> 09:08.918
And as soon as
you're checked out,

09:08.919 --> 09:09.979
you can go on home.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.721
You're safe. We got this.

09:11.722 --> 09:13.823
(Laughs) You're kicking us out?

09:13.824 --> 09:15.755
This is icky stuff. You
don't want any part of this.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.956
I'm a pathologist.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.888
I am not going anywhere.

09:18.889 --> 09:21.631
And c.D.C. Does not
have any jurisdiction here

09:21.632 --> 09:23.933
without a direct invitation
from public health.

09:23.934 --> 09:25.835
And a letter of formal request

09:25.836 --> 09:28.838
from Dr. Kate Murphy.

09:28.839 --> 09:30.770
(People speaking indistinctly)

09:30.771 --> 09:33.703
Of course you did.

09:33.704 --> 09:35.845
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

09:35.846 --> 09:36.946
(Man) Step forward, please.

09:36.947 --> 09:38.948
Hold out your hands.

09:38.949 --> 09:42.752
Everybody wears their
I.D. Tag at all times.

09:42.753 --> 09:43.913
(Emergency radio chatter)

09:43.914 --> 09:46.015
(Man) Keep it moving, people.

09:46.016 --> 09:49.689
(Man) Take one
blanket and one gown.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.790
(Woman) All right,
folks, come on.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.722
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

09:52.723 --> 09:53.993
(Woman) Form a line over here.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.995
(Man) ...A level-6
control point.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.967
(Man) The changing
rooms are this way.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.769
Nobody comes in without a badge.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.671
(Woman) Hands over your head.

10:01.672 --> 10:02.932
(Spray hisses)

10:02.933 --> 10:05.975
Drop the bag in the receptacle.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.807
(Man) Keep it moving.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.779
Hands over your head.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.742
(People speaking indistinctly)

10:12.743 --> 10:14.844
(Man) Keep moving, please.

10:14.845 --> 10:16.746
(Woman) Have you
had any headaches?

10:16.747 --> 10:18.688
Nausea?

10:18.689 --> 10:21.921
Are you experiencing
any dry mouth?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.953
How about dizziness?

10:23.954 --> 10:26.757
(Man speaks indistinctly)

10:27.858 --> 10:30.860
(Woman speaks
indistinctly over radio)

10:30.861 --> 10:32.962
(Man speaks indistinctly)

10:32.963 --> 10:36.065
(Man) We'll get you through
just as soon as we can.

10:36.066 --> 10:37.867
Please keep moving.

10:37.868 --> 10:38.938
(People speaking indistinctly)

10:38.939 --> 10:40.810
Step up.

10:40.811 --> 10:42.972
Take one and head upstairs.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.914
(Man) Step up.

10:44.915 --> 10:47.918
(Indistinct conversations)

10:54.725 --> 10:57.728
(Indistinct conversations)

11:04.034 --> 11:06.035
Oh, funny meeting you here.

11:06.036 --> 11:07.997
They decontaminated
half the station

11:07.998 --> 11:09.098
after trevino left,

11:09.099 --> 11:10.840
us included.

11:10.841 --> 11:13.042
Remind me to never
investigate a plague again.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.074
We're fine!

11:15.075 --> 11:16.906
You can let us out now!

11:16.907 --> 11:18.808
Hello!

11:18.809 --> 11:20.009
We need to get back to work.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.781
Just let 'em do their jobs.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.912
Their jobs?

11:22.913 --> 11:24.854
(Kate) Outbreaks are
the c.D.C.'S domain,

11:24.855 --> 11:26.085
and I am not opposed
to their expertise.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.788
I really don't know why you are.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.860
She said it, sweetheart, not me.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.792
No fever, blood count's normal.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.824
You're free to go home.

11:34.825 --> 11:36.065
Just monitor your temperatures.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.097
I think I'll miss
you most of all.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.770
Yeah, you're making a big
mistake. You need our help.

11:40.771 --> 11:43.072
Did you clear variant
creutzfeldt-Jakob in '96,

11:43.073 --> 11:45.975
eliminate dracunculiasis
in all of Uganda?

11:45.976 --> 11:47.837
No. That was me.

11:47.838 --> 11:49.038
You're working on
people, not variants.

11:49.039 --> 11:51.040
And your fancy words
don't impress me.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.983
I've performed brain
surgeries you couldn't spell.

11:53.984 --> 11:56.846
Goody for you. I put my life
on the line to save people.

11:56.847 --> 11:57.987
Then you should take advantage

11:57.988 --> 12:00.149
of what's standing
right in front of you.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.091
Okay.

12:02.092 --> 12:04.123
You first.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.026
What do you got?

12:11.061 --> 12:13.062
(Telephone rings, line clicks)

12:13.063 --> 12:14.804
(Female electronic voice) Hello.

12:14.805 --> 12:16.005
No one is available
to take your call.

12:16.006 --> 12:17.066
Please leave a message.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.938
(Voice mail beeps)

12:18.939 --> 12:20.970
Mrs. Alvarez, this
is Peter dunlop.

12:20.971 --> 12:23.072
Um... something
has happened to Dani,

12:23.073 --> 12:25.946
and I need you to call
me as soon as you get this.

12:32.883 --> 12:33.953
Hey.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.154
What's up?

12:35.155 --> 12:38.187
Uh, I just wanted to say, uh,

12:38.188 --> 12:40.860
that if there's anything
I could do, that, uh...

12:40.861 --> 12:43.162
You know, Dani meant a lot to...

12:43.163 --> 12:45.094
I-I got it. Thanks.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.837
(People speaking indistinctly)

12:47.838 --> 12:49.939
Right.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.943
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

12:55.846 --> 12:57.848
(Elevator bell dings)

13:06.957 --> 13:10.189
(Hisses)

13:10.190 --> 13:12.892
(Hiss)

13:12.893 --> 13:16.065
Welcome to biosafety level four.

13:16.066 --> 13:18.027
Dr. Stafford's
been expecting you

13:18.028 --> 13:20.029
and requested I help
you with your suit.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.902
Uh, no. I've been dressing
myself for quite some time.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.205
Thank you.

13:28.939 --> 13:31.942
(Indistinct conversations)

13:41.121 --> 13:43.893
(Megan) Love what
you've done with the place.

13:43.894 --> 13:46.055
I see that you're
assuming the worst...

13:46.056 --> 13:47.957
Anthrax, tularemia.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.929
Well, it sure
ain't the sniffles.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.230
Body count's 26 already.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.232
Oh, my god. It
doubled overnight?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.134
We're trying to keep
this on the down low,

13:55.135 --> 13:57.937
but the news is gonna get out.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.208
You reset the timeline.

13:59.209 --> 14:00.970
You just threw out all our work.

14:00.971 --> 14:02.942
We reorganized by symptom class.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.243
Sometimes it's
better not to assume.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.015
You assume that
we stink at our jobs.

14:06.016 --> 14:08.017
My team has been
together for over a decade.

14:08.018 --> 14:11.120
Our error rate is the lowest
in the western hemisphere.

14:11.121 --> 14:12.251
Nothing personal.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.053
That's exactly what's
wrong with you.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.925
Nothing is personal.

14:15.926 --> 14:17.987
It's all error rates
and body counts.

14:17.988 --> 14:20.129
Who's trying to save
the city here, huh?

14:20.130 --> 14:22.992
Then let me show you
mistakes you've already made.

14:22.993 --> 14:26.265
Cameron Reilly, a triathlete,
resting heart rate of 50.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.267
Her heart failure did not
happen just overnight.

14:28.268 --> 14:32.201
John Kim... his gumline suggests
that he lied about smoking.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.944
And that brings
us to Dani Alvarez.

14:34.945 --> 14:36.245
She probably looked
like a drug addict to you

14:36.246 --> 14:38.107
because of her tattoos
and her jaundice...

14:38.108 --> 14:40.209
Now you're making
assumptions about me.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.951
The point is, she was clean.

14:41.952 --> 14:43.152
No more than a
couple of drinks a week.

14:43.153 --> 14:44.213
How do you know that?

14:44.214 --> 14:46.185
Because she told me.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.217
She worked here.
She was one of us.

14:48.218 --> 14:50.019
Well, then this is
never gonna work.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.021
You are way too
emotionally involved.

14:52.022 --> 14:55.164
Which is all the more reason
why my team should be here.

14:55.165 --> 14:57.026
This I know...

14:57.027 --> 14:59.098
When someone you
care about is on your slab,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.030
it's a lot harder to focus.

15:01.031 --> 15:03.233
Right now, that's all we can do.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.037
And it's because we care.

15:08.178 --> 15:11.181
Point taken. Bring 'em in.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.090
(Spray hisses)

15:22.052 --> 15:23.352
What's with the tape?

15:23.353 --> 15:25.324
What, not enough?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.056
Boy, what's wrong with you?

15:27.057 --> 15:30.129
John Kim had no
connection to any other victim.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.200
So it's indiscriminate.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.062
But get this... he had

15:33.063 --> 15:36.035
neutrophilic leukocytosis
with a left shift.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.106
(Curtis) And it gets worse.

15:37.107 --> 15:39.208
He's got purpura of the abdomen.

15:39.209 --> 15:40.239
Sepsis.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.041
We gotta get ahead of this.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.172
(Stafford) Whatever
it is, John Kim here

15:43.173 --> 15:44.373
has got it in spades.

15:44.374 --> 15:46.375
This could be our patient zero.

15:46.376 --> 15:48.047
(Intercom beeps)

15:48.048 --> 15:49.349
Stafford, hunt.

15:52.182 --> 15:53.382
Tell me you found
the connection.

15:53.383 --> 15:56.085
Not the kind you're looking for.

15:56.086 --> 15:57.356
YouTube flagged this

15:57.357 --> 15:59.328
and forwarded it
to us confidentially.

15:59.329 --> 16:01.160
(Clicks)

16:01.161 --> 16:04.233
My fellow human beings...

16:04.234 --> 16:06.235
There are over
seven billion people

16:06.236 --> 16:08.337
on the planet, and
it's getting worse.

16:08.338 --> 16:12.101
The simple truth is, there
are just too many of you.

16:12.102 --> 16:14.103
And now a whole lot of you

16:14.104 --> 16:16.105
are going to die.

16:16.106 --> 16:18.077
We have become a disease,

16:18.078 --> 16:20.079
and the only cure
for overpopulation

16:20.080 --> 16:21.380
is to depopulate.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.054
So congrats, Philadelphia.

16:25.055 --> 16:27.186
You are the first
to be sacrificed

16:27.187 --> 16:28.387
to a new a world order,

16:28.388 --> 16:31.190
an order as nature intended it.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.222
And for this

16:33.223 --> 16:36.165
you have only
yourselves to thank.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.227
This isn't just an epidemic.

16:38.228 --> 16:41.171
It's an act of terrorism.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.439
He could be a
nationalist or a cultist

16:50.440 --> 16:52.441
or some local nut job.

16:52.442 --> 16:54.443
Well, if we take his
speech at face value,

16:54.444 --> 16:56.215
he's an ecoterrorist.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.317
Doesn't look like smallpox.
Too quick to be fungal.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.149
We've already got all the
I.C.U.S covered with cipro.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.290
If it's bacterial, that'll work.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.421
Otherwise, we keep
our options open.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.223
Just let us do our job.

17:04.224 --> 17:07.156
We have had 33
victims in 36 hours.

17:07.157 --> 17:10.459
The most important question
is, how are they getting infected?

17:10.460 --> 17:13.102
That is the third most
important question.

17:13.103 --> 17:14.433
The most important question
is, who in hell or heaven

17:14.434 --> 17:17.106
put you in charge
of this meeting?

17:17.107 --> 17:19.168
Then the second question
must be, who are you?

17:19.169 --> 17:21.440
Brendan Johnson, FBI,
special agent in charge.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.212
What are we telling the public?

17:23.213 --> 17:25.114
That's tricky.

17:25.115 --> 17:26.445
We don't want to panic
the public, but if we hedge...

17:26.446 --> 17:28.317
How about telling
them the truth?

17:28.318 --> 17:29.378
Why is she still
talking? Anyone?

17:29.379 --> 17:31.250
Dr. Hunt works for
me at the m.E.O.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.451
I don't give a crap who's who.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.453
We are working
on cause of death.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.255
We're here for our update.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.457
You don't get an
update. We get an update.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.190
(Chuckles)

17:41.191 --> 17:42.331
All right.

17:42.332 --> 17:44.333
We got victims
all over the place.

17:44.334 --> 17:47.396
We got a, uh, bus driver here,

17:47.397 --> 17:49.268
a lawyer there,

17:49.269 --> 17:51.140
this pretty young thing here.

17:51.141 --> 17:52.341
She was more than that.

17:52.342 --> 17:53.502
Oh, yeah. I know. She's got a
mommy and a daddy. I get it.

17:53.503 --> 17:55.205
Okay, go to hell.

17:59.209 --> 18:00.279
What's his problem?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.410
That was his girlfriend.

18:01.411 --> 18:03.483
Not that you give
a crap who's who.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.357
(Voice breaking) Alberto's
headaches started on Friday.

18:08.358 --> 18:12.321
No fever, no cough.

18:12.322 --> 18:15.164
He didn't say anything
else was wrong.

18:15.165 --> 18:17.466
At noon, he went
into center city

18:17.467 --> 18:19.528
for our niece's quinceañera.

18:19.529 --> 18:23.173
(Voice breaking) Amy wrote
about everything she did...

18:24.334 --> 18:26.405
A lot more than we knew about.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.178
What do we do
for our other kids?

18:29.179 --> 18:30.510
Is this contagious?

18:32.212 --> 18:35.384
You think that my dad's
death was just random?

18:35.385 --> 18:37.446
'Cause I've got
these friends in Korea,

18:37.447 --> 18:40.219
and they're saying
there's a video out there,

18:40.220 --> 18:42.251
like a terrorist?

18:42.252 --> 18:44.193
Your friends must be mistaken.

18:44.194 --> 18:45.324
A criminal video like that

18:45.325 --> 18:47.326
would've been
confiscated immediately.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.528
Will you explain to him
how the Internet works?

18:49.529 --> 18:51.330
That video went viral.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.363
No one can contain it.

18:54.364 --> 18:57.307
(Sighs)

18:59.209 --> 19:00.409
(Marcel) What do
you want with me?

19:00.410 --> 19:02.211
Everywhere you've been

19:02.212 --> 19:03.542
and everyone you've
been in contact with

19:03.543 --> 19:05.344
for the last seven days.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.546
I'm a car salesman
from upper darby.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.548
With two priors for possession.

19:09.549 --> 19:13.352
Two eighths of weed doesn't
exactly make me osama bin laden.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.225
If I'm your best lead, you're
a disgrace to the force.

19:16.226 --> 19:17.426
Look around you.

19:17.427 --> 19:18.527
People are dying,

19:18.528 --> 19:20.289
and you were one of
the first ones to get sick.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.590
Now where have you been?

19:21.591 --> 19:24.233
Doesn't matter. Yeah, it does.

19:24.234 --> 19:26.474
Well, I'm not talking, so what
are you gonna do about it?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.373
Could you put him

19:34.374 --> 19:35.504
in isolation?

19:35.505 --> 19:37.346
What? What the
hell are you doing?

19:37.347 --> 19:39.548
What do you think? I'm
putting you in solitary.

19:39.549 --> 19:42.582
Oh, well, that's fine. I
could use a little privacy.

19:43.613 --> 19:45.454
Fine.

19:45.455 --> 19:47.286
Then you'll get none.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.288
I will be there every minute,

19:49.289 --> 19:52.291
and from the look of you,
it's not gonna be that long.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.393
Now you will talk to
me or I promise you,

19:54.394 --> 19:57.367
I will be the last
face you ever see.

19:59.429 --> 20:02.271
I work at, uh, 35 penn station.

20:02.272 --> 20:04.403
Tuesday, uh,

20:04.404 --> 20:05.634
I... had work all day,

20:05.635 --> 20:07.536
then I had lunch at...

20:07.537 --> 20:10.479
Wsce has received word
that the city-wide outbreak

20:10.480 --> 20:12.641
that has so far claimed 36 lives

20:12.642 --> 20:15.284
and infected over 70 people

20:15.285 --> 20:17.546
might be an act of terrorism.

20:17.547 --> 20:19.418
Sources say... (Clicks)

20:19.419 --> 20:21.550
Well, the cat's out of the bag.
Who didn't see that coming?

20:21.551 --> 20:24.453
This damn suit is
gon' drive me crazy.

20:24.454 --> 20:26.455
I'm telling you, Ethan,
all this protection

20:26.456 --> 20:28.597
is gon' end up costing
more lives than it saves.

20:28.598 --> 20:30.459
(Laughs) Speak for yourself.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.432
I, for one, am grateful that
we're not taking unnecessary...

20:33.433 --> 20:35.434
(Rips)

20:35.435 --> 20:36.665
Oh, my god.

20:36.666 --> 20:39.438
Did you hear that?! Did it rip?!

20:39.439 --> 20:42.371
Ethan.

20:42.372 --> 20:43.442
You're okay.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.513
(Door hisses)

20:44.514 --> 20:46.515
If my lab goes all to hell,

20:46.516 --> 20:49.319
it's because of
your duct-taped ass.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.451
(Intercom beeps)

20:52.452 --> 20:54.383
More info on Dani.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.455
I, uh, figured out where she was

20:56.456 --> 20:58.457
on Wednesday and Thursday...
A matinee with a friend

20:58.458 --> 21:00.489
and then kickboxing
class at night.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.661
Oh, well, that's good. So
all we have to do is figure out

21:02.662 --> 21:04.533
where she was Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday all day.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.465
I'm doing my best
here, Ethan, okay?

21:06.466 --> 21:09.538
Look, we think Dani
got infected early.

21:09.539 --> 21:13.372
So we need to know
where she's been.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.603
She took the week off.

21:14.604 --> 21:16.545
Well, did you try
calling her family?

21:16.546 --> 21:18.547
Her mom must be
out of town, okay?

21:18.548 --> 21:20.579
I-I have another number,
but there is no answer,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.381
and I don't know whose it is.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.652
Well, there's gotta
be something more.

21:23.653 --> 21:24.713
Yeah, well, if there is,

21:24.714 --> 21:26.515
she certainly didn't
share it with me!

21:26.516 --> 21:27.587
(Receiver clatters)

21:29.559 --> 21:32.422
(Clicks keyboard keys)

21:33.593 --> 21:35.394
Curtis.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.726
Curtis!

21:37.727 --> 21:39.668
Tell me something
good. (Elevator bell dings)

21:39.669 --> 21:41.630
You are looking at
neisseria meningitidis,

21:41.631 --> 21:43.372
rare strain.

21:43.373 --> 21:44.633
We have positive I.D.
It fits all the symptoms.

21:44.634 --> 21:45.704
That's good.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.406
In one patient.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.677
We found the organism
in one patient only.

21:48.678 --> 21:50.539
We need to confirm
in other cases.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.441
Negative. How's it spread?

21:52.442 --> 21:53.512
Bacteria's aerosolized.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.584
Oh, god. It's airborne.

21:55.585 --> 21:58.717
I'll start spreading the news.
You start treating the bug.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.419
You are telling the public what?

22:00.420 --> 22:01.550
Our best theory.

22:01.551 --> 22:03.392
(Elevator bell dings)
Your best theory's a lie.

22:03.393 --> 22:04.593
(Kate) It's not a lie.

22:04.594 --> 22:06.395
Listen, we've
got a positive I.D.,

22:06.396 --> 22:08.397
and Johnson has to
tell the public something.

22:08.398 --> 22:11.400
We just ignored
99% of our victims.

22:11.401 --> 22:12.501
He should lead with that.

22:12.502 --> 22:13.562
What would you tell 'em?

22:13.563 --> 22:14.703
The truth. We don't
know anything yet.

22:14.704 --> 22:16.665
Oh, yeah. You want
to tell the public that?

22:16.666 --> 22:17.766
Bring your running shoes.

22:17.767 --> 22:19.738
You want me to give the
speech? Kate, come on.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.570
This is fifth-grade science.

22:21.571 --> 22:22.771
If your hypothesis is unproven,

22:22.772 --> 22:24.573
you don't announce a conclusion.

22:24.574 --> 22:26.445
You don't have science, Megan.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.516
This is all speculation.

22:27.517 --> 22:29.418
(Scoffs) You are
about to go wide

22:29.419 --> 22:30.679
with information

22:30.680 --> 22:32.681
that is incredibly
narrow and fragile.

22:32.682 --> 22:34.523
You're talking to me
about speculation?

22:34.524 --> 22:36.585
You're pushing me.
You need to be pushed.

22:36.586 --> 22:38.588
(Inhales sharply) Ah.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.662
(People speaking indistinctly)

22:43.663 --> 22:46.466
I'm done here. Prep Brad Wilson.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.773
(Foot pedal clanks)

23:12.492 --> 23:15.424
Here's a script
confirming meningitis

23:15.425 --> 23:16.665
and prophylactic steps
to prevent infection.

23:16.666 --> 23:18.697
"Symptoms include pustules,

23:18.698 --> 23:20.699
catastrophic heart failure,
and bleeding eyes"?

23:20.700 --> 23:22.501
This will scare the
hell out of people.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.632
Who the hell wrote this?

23:23.633 --> 23:26.505
I did. Science is scary
when you understand it.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.477
I'll take a pass, soften it.

23:28.478 --> 23:30.479
Listen, we need a,
uh, a human angle.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.710
What about, uh, Peter dunlop?

23:31.711 --> 23:33.642
His girlfriend was
an early victim, right?

23:33.643 --> 23:35.514
He's here, isn't
he? He's perfect.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.446
Get him on camera.
N-Not a chance.

23:37.447 --> 23:39.518
He's helping my team
solve a city-wide contagion...

23:39.519 --> 23:40.649
Ah. Right now.

23:40.650 --> 23:42.491
(Sighs)

23:42.492 --> 23:44.422
What's ahab's mood?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.595
Oh, sunshine and puppies.

23:46.596 --> 23:48.657
Excuse me. Uh, we have a lead.

23:48.658 --> 23:50.559
A local guy.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.531
(Morris) Even has a
web site recommending

23:52.532 --> 23:54.202
disease as a cure
for overpopulation.

23:54.203 --> 23:55.604
(Elevator bell dings) We
can have him within the hour.

23:55.605 --> 23:57.205
Great. Bring him in.

23:57.206 --> 23:58.567
Uh, we're gonna
need some backup.

23:58.568 --> 23:59.738
Get 'em whatever they need.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.470
Follow me.

24:01.471 --> 24:04.212
(Indistinct conversations)

24:04.213 --> 24:05.714
We have some encouraging news.

24:05.715 --> 24:07.646
We have confirmed meningitis.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.748
Preventative measures are
currently being put in place

24:09.749 --> 24:11.580
at public offices...
(Thermometer beeps)

24:11.581 --> 24:12.781
And schools throughout the city.

24:12.782 --> 24:14.753
The strain of this bacteria
is virulent in nature,

24:14.754 --> 24:16.725
and we must take extreme
caution... I don't get it.

24:16.726 --> 24:18.587
You have never shied
away from the limelight.

24:18.588 --> 24:20.559
This is the biggest
show in town,

24:20.560 --> 24:21.760
and you're
deferring to this idiot.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.632
Megan, I know you think
this is in your wheelhouse.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.564
It's not. We don't even
know what we have.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.736
It is not airborne
and it's not meningitis

24:27.737 --> 24:29.698
and... In law enforcement have
not been immune to this tragedy.

24:29.699 --> 24:31.640
Why... why is Peter's
picture up there?

24:31.641 --> 24:34.242
Peter dunlop, an
investigator for the m.E.O.,

24:34.243 --> 24:36.244
lost his girlfriend,
Dani Alvarez...

24:36.245 --> 24:37.806
That ass. We haven't
even notified her mother yet.

24:37.807 --> 24:40.779
Our hearts go out to him

24:40.780 --> 24:43.512
and the entire Alvarez family

24:43.513 --> 24:45.654
and everyone
impacted in this city.

24:45.655 --> 24:47.556
May god bless
us all. (Pauses TV)

24:47.557 --> 24:49.758
He is lying to everyone,
and you are allowing it.

24:49.759 --> 24:52.521
People do not
need to be coddled.

24:52.522 --> 24:54.693
They can handle the
truth if you inspire them,

24:54.694 --> 24:56.264
and you do that.

24:56.265 --> 24:58.266
He's doing his job.

24:58.267 --> 25:00.799
I am doing my job. What
are you doing exactly?

25:00.800 --> 25:03.772
(Scoffs)

25:03.773 --> 25:07.537
(People speaking indistinctly)

25:10.610 --> 25:11.840
There's too damn
many people in the world.

25:11.841 --> 25:13.582
But they're never gonna learn.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.744
I hope they all die, too.

25:15.745 --> 25:17.285
(Men) Get down!
Get down! Get down!

25:17.286 --> 25:18.547
Get down! Get down!
Get down! Get down!

25:18.548 --> 25:19.748
What the hell?!

25:19.749 --> 25:21.750
(Sam) Hands behind
your back. Now!

25:21.751 --> 25:23.622
Terry mcleary,
you're under arrest

25:23.623 --> 25:25.794
for suspicion of
domestic terrorism

25:25.795 --> 25:27.756
and homicide. (Man) Transport!

25:27.757 --> 25:30.298
(Megan) The loops go
over your ears like... that's it.

25:30.299 --> 25:31.700
Good.

25:31.701 --> 25:33.632
The FBI guy on TV said
that everything was fine.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.833
It will be, sweetheart.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.635
Uh, grandma's gonna
come pick you up,

25:36.636 --> 25:38.707
and she won't know how
to load your Insulin pump,

25:38.708 --> 25:40.308
so will you show her?

25:40.309 --> 25:41.870
Yes. When are you gonna be home?

25:41.871 --> 25:43.812
And what about cartridges,
do you have enough?

25:43.813 --> 25:46.675
I have enough stuff in my
backpack to last me a week.

25:46.676 --> 25:48.316
How long is this gonna be?

25:48.317 --> 25:50.719
Okay, well, then just wear
the gloves and the mask,

25:50.720 --> 25:53.882
and stay inside with grandma,
and everything will be okay.

25:53.883 --> 25:56.324
(Voice breaking) Mom,
you're freaking me out.

25:56.325 --> 25:57.787
Did the guy on TV lie?

25:59.859 --> 26:01.790
(People speaking indistinctly)

26:01.791 --> 26:03.792
Lacey, I need you to put
your phone away, please.

26:03.793 --> 26:05.595
Lace.

26:06.796 --> 26:08.697
I love you, baby.

26:08.698 --> 26:09.898
Mom, you say "I love you"

26:09.899 --> 26:11.900
like you're never gonna
see me again. Lacey.

26:11.901 --> 26:13.702
I'm talking to my mom.

26:13.703 --> 26:15.674
She's a medical examiner.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.776
Stay calm. Check
each other's masks.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.577
(Students speaking indistinctly)

26:19.578 --> 26:21.349
You can't go home yet. We
have to stay inside, okay?

26:21.350 --> 26:22.751
(Man) Dr. Hunt?

26:22.752 --> 26:24.883
Uh, lace, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.885
Mom, wait. (Clicks mouse)

26:26.886 --> 26:28.788
(Exhales deeply)

26:32.622 --> 26:33.862
(Clatters)

26:33.863 --> 26:36.594
Look, I would never hurt anyone.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.627
Really? Well, uh,
I'm confused then,

26:38.628 --> 26:40.629
because, uh, your web site here,

26:40.630 --> 26:43.632
you talk about, uh,
oh, forced castration,

26:43.633 --> 26:44.833
murder.

26:44.834 --> 26:47.706
Oh, here's one that
seems relevant... disease.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.907
Would I be upset if
this helped turn attention

26:48.908 --> 26:50.839
to a global crisis? No.

26:50.840 --> 26:51.940
Overpopulation's
gonna be our downfall.

26:51.941 --> 26:53.682
(Door opens)

26:53.683 --> 26:54.783
Is that why you've been
spreading meningitis?

26:54.784 --> 26:56.645
What are you talking about?

26:56.646 --> 26:58.647
I haven't been doing
anything, and it's not meningitis.

26:58.648 --> 26:59.718
If it were airborne,
we'd all be dead.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.721
Oh, some pretty
smart people think

27:02.722 --> 27:03.852
it is meningitis.

27:03.853 --> 27:05.724
Well, I can't account
for their stupidity.

27:05.725 --> 27:06.895
Then what the hell is it?

27:06.896 --> 27:08.396
Do I look like a
doctor? I'm... I'm sorry.

27:08.397 --> 27:09.758
Dude, I'm in high school.

27:09.759 --> 27:11.900
Come on, you're a little more
educated than that, dude...

27:11.901 --> 27:13.702
A.p. Courses,

27:13.703 --> 27:15.834
three summers interning
at medical school.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.836
So I like science.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.810
Okay, then help
me solve a problem.

27:21.971 --> 27:24.973
We found 40 cases
of cerebral edema,

27:24.974 --> 27:26.775
but only one case

27:26.776 --> 27:28.747
with an inflamed
lining of the brain.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.418
One? (Chuckles)

27:30.419 --> 27:34.823
Okay, I'm gonna speak
slowly so you can understand.

27:34.824 --> 27:36.825
Meningitis is an inflamed
lining of the brain,

27:36.826 --> 27:38.426
and you only found one.

27:38.427 --> 27:40.959
How do you explain
meningitis with that?

27:40.960 --> 27:42.791
(Megan) Hmm.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.432
Guess you can't.

27:44.433 --> 27:46.664
Mm. Yeah, you can't. No one can.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.796
I mean, seriously,
how does it feel

27:47.797 --> 27:48.937
to get schooled by a teenager?

27:48.938 --> 27:50.438
I don't know.

27:50.439 --> 27:51.771
Ask him.

27:54.443 --> 27:55.704
(People speaking indistinctly)

27:55.705 --> 27:57.876
Hey. That supposed
to prove something?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.677
Yeah, you can't even
fool a 17 year old.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.879
So why don't you just give
up this meningitis nonsense?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.680
Unless you want to be the idiot

28:02.681 --> 28:05.854
that everybody blames
for lying to the public.

28:05.855 --> 28:08.858
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

28:15.694 --> 28:18.927
24 gram stains for
meningitis, all negative.

28:18.928 --> 28:20.999
Wh-what, do you
have a death wish?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.871
It's not airborne.

28:22.872 --> 28:24.933
We don't need these space suits.

28:24.934 --> 28:27.806
The odds of me
contracting whatever this is

28:27.807 --> 28:29.878
from this delightful
conversation are zero.

28:29.879 --> 28:31.039
You don't know that.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.941
We need a bigger sample size.

28:32.942 --> 28:34.943
So you're saying that
more people need to die

28:34.944 --> 28:36.985
in order for us to figure out
why more people are dying?

28:36.986 --> 28:38.947
Statistics don't lie.

28:38.948 --> 28:40.789
They're not statistics.

28:40.790 --> 28:43.852
They are people.

28:43.853 --> 28:47.926
Dani Alvarez, our earliest
case, pulmonary edema.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.029
John Kim, your only
positive, massive sepsis.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.862
Those are two entirely
different causes of death.

28:53.863 --> 28:55.864
Megan, we've already
identified a disease

28:55.865 --> 28:57.966
that accounts for
all the symptoms.

28:57.967 --> 29:00.038
Maybe. Emphysema could
explain difficulty breathing.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.810
So what?

29:01.811 --> 29:04.742
What is more likely,
a long-term smoker

29:04.743 --> 29:05.974
having emphysema

29:05.975 --> 29:08.046
or 24 victims having
a basic bacteria

29:08.047 --> 29:09.517
that we can't find?

29:09.518 --> 29:10.879
If you're right,

29:10.880 --> 29:12.750
then we're talking
about an exotic virus...

29:12.751 --> 29:13.952
Lassa or dengue.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.854
Both of which are
much more dangerous.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.787
But not airborne.

29:18.788 --> 29:20.758
(Air whooshes)

29:20.759 --> 29:22.932
(Exhales)

29:24.063 --> 29:25.533
(Exhales deeply)

29:25.534 --> 29:27.836
That's better.

29:27.837 --> 29:29.037
Which means, we are left

29:29.038 --> 29:32.540
with only one major mode

29:32.541 --> 29:35.073
of transmission...

29:35.074 --> 29:36.544
Blood.

29:36.545 --> 29:38.807
And as long as you don't

29:38.808 --> 29:40.809
come in contact with it,

29:40.810 --> 29:42.081
you're fine.

29:57.266 --> 30:01.170
(Hisses)

30:03.973 --> 30:05.503
(Door hisses)

30:05.504 --> 30:08.276
(Stafford) We're up to 50 dead.

30:08.277 --> 30:11.539
It's gonna be thousands if
we don't get ahead of this thing.

30:11.540 --> 30:14.312
This disease is
all over the map.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.413
There's only

30:15.414 --> 30:18.586
a few infections that
can spread that quickly.

30:18.587 --> 30:20.818
I'm gonna put every
febrile inpatient in this city

30:20.819 --> 30:22.820
on antibiotics.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.353
Against what?

30:25.354 --> 30:28.426
Can we please get Peter's
picture off the damn television?

30:28.427 --> 30:30.358
No, we cannot.

30:30.359 --> 30:31.429
It's news.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.461
No, it's not. It's personal.

30:33.462 --> 30:36.404
People want to know that
we're suffering just like they are.

30:36.405 --> 30:37.605
Yeah, you're
exploiting Peter's pain.

30:37.606 --> 30:39.407
I'm securing the public trust.

30:39.408 --> 30:41.469
(Scoffs) I kinda
thought we'd do that

30:41.470 --> 30:42.570
with timely, honest information.

30:42.571 --> 30:43.611
Oh, really?

30:43.612 --> 30:45.573
Well, then why is it

30:45.574 --> 30:47.275
that Peter dunlop, who
had intimate relations

30:47.276 --> 30:48.616
with one of the first victims,

30:48.617 --> 30:51.849
is the last guy to give
me any useful information?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.481
It's not that easy.

30:53.482 --> 30:55.283
Patient histories aren't

30:55.284 --> 30:57.425
always transparent.

30:57.426 --> 30:59.527
Or maybe...

30:59.528 --> 31:02.631
I'm not the only idiot lying.

31:05.634 --> 31:08.366
I saw on the news that you
were Dani Alvarez's boyfriend

31:08.367 --> 31:11.469
so I came here to see
what happened to her.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.372
How did you know her?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.643
My parents are gone.

31:15.644 --> 31:18.406
I live in a foster home, and...

31:18.407 --> 31:19.648
Dani was like a sister.

31:21.610 --> 31:24.452
Did you spend
much time together?

31:24.453 --> 31:26.384
Couple times a month maybe.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.386
And what did you do together?

31:28.387 --> 31:30.458
Mostly just hung out

31:30.459 --> 31:33.591
and listened to music on vinyl.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.393
Oh... (Chuckles) Let me guess.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.325
She said it was more authentic.

31:37.326 --> 31:38.396
Yeah.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.627
Yeah, I don't get it either.

31:39.628 --> 31:43.331
She took me to my first ballet,

31:43.332 --> 31:45.533
got me interested in dance.

31:45.534 --> 31:48.906
You were supposed to meet
her this past Monday, right?

31:48.907 --> 31:52.510
She said she had something,
but we talked on the phone.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.482
And what did you talk about?

31:54.483 --> 31:56.484
I was having boy issues.

31:56.485 --> 32:00.349
But she straightened me out.

32:01.390 --> 32:03.652
I'm really gonna miss her.

32:16.365 --> 32:17.635
(Morris) Jean-Jeannie,
for once in our relationship,

32:17.636 --> 32:19.667
this cannot be an argument.

32:19.668 --> 32:22.510
I need you to get your
keys, get in the car,

32:22.511 --> 32:24.642
and drive to your
sister's in Scranton.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.474
No, i...

32:26.475 --> 32:28.716
I have been through
decontamination. I am fine.

32:28.717 --> 32:31.449
Now just... go.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.451
(Indistinct conversations)

32:33.452 --> 32:35.523
(Voice breaks) I love you, too.

32:35.524 --> 32:36.654
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

32:36.655 --> 32:38.686
(Cell phone beeps)

32:38.687 --> 32:40.528
Sacrificed to a new world...

32:40.529 --> 32:41.629
(Mouse clicks)

32:41.630 --> 32:44.663
(Indistinct conversations)

32:46.535 --> 32:48.736
60 new cases today, and
you are watching a video

32:48.737 --> 32:51.569
of the one place we
know the terrorist isn't.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.542
Yeah, because it's the
one place we know he was.

32:54.543 --> 32:56.704
Here.

32:56.705 --> 32:59.677
Tell me what you hear.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.409
There are over seven billion...

33:01.410 --> 33:02.680
Some crackpot telling
me, we're all gonna die.

33:02.681 --> 33:03.751
No, listen again.

33:03.752 --> 33:05.713
In the background,
what do you hear?

33:05.714 --> 33:08.756
The simple truth is, there
are just too many of you.

33:08.757 --> 33:11.989
Come on. You hear any church bells, trains,
cars? And now a whole lot of you are...

33:11.990 --> 33:14.622
The FBI criminalists have
been all over this tape.

33:14.623 --> 33:16.494
Yeah, but they don't
know Philly like we do.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.625
That's a quiet area.

33:17.626 --> 33:18.766
And from the looks
of that building,

33:18.767 --> 33:20.498
there's no one
taking care of it.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.729
So it's an abandoned
building in north Philly.

33:21.730 --> 33:24.602
But 40% of the buildings
over there are shuttered up.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.534
I'm gonna strangle you.

33:26.535 --> 33:27.735
(Clicks keyboard key)

33:27.736 --> 33:29.577
Look at the red
tag on the side wall.

33:29.578 --> 33:31.509
It looks like graffiti, right?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.740
Okay. (Clicks keyboard keys)

33:32.741 --> 33:36.013
You see this?
That's a red star 7.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.616
The b-7 gang runs drugs

33:38.617 --> 33:40.548
in a very tight 4-block
radius in north Philly.

33:40.549 --> 33:42.520
We could canvass that easy.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.591
Uh-huh.

33:43.592 --> 33:45.693
But we were wrong once before,

33:45.694 --> 33:48.756
and captain fantastic is
never gonna listen to us.

33:48.757 --> 33:50.798
Look, bud, I know you're
worried. I'm worried, too.

33:50.799 --> 33:52.660
But if we do our jobs,

33:52.661 --> 33:55.463
we could save the world.

33:55.464 --> 33:57.505
That was good.

33:57.506 --> 33:58.806
Let's grab our capes.

33:58.807 --> 34:00.638
(Chuckles)

34:00.639 --> 34:02.611
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

34:06.745 --> 34:07.815
(Door crashes open)

34:07.816 --> 34:09.478
(Man speaks indistinctly)

34:11.480 --> 34:12.551
Clear.

34:15.754 --> 34:16.825
Clear.

34:25.734 --> 34:27.795
Bodies.

34:27.796 --> 34:31.769
(Indistinct conversations)

34:31.770 --> 34:33.501
(Insects buzzing)

34:33.502 --> 34:35.072
You all right, detective?

34:35.073 --> 34:38.506
(Buzzing continues)

34:38.507 --> 34:39.847
(Sam) Track marks.

34:39.848 --> 34:43.511
And there's syringes
all over the place.

34:43.512 --> 34:45.553
(Morris) Hey, Sam. Look at this.

34:45.554 --> 34:47.815
It's the same tag
as on the video.

34:47.816 --> 34:50.518
I guess now we know where
the terrorist made the tape.

34:50.519 --> 34:52.760
We also know how he's
spreading it to the public.

34:52.761 --> 34:55.693
Get this analyzed as
soon as possible. On it.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.625
You don't think he's running
around stabbing people, do you?

34:57.626 --> 34:59.096
It fits.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.828
All these new victims
have needle sticks.

35:00.829 --> 35:02.730
No, they don't.
Three of them do.

35:02.731 --> 35:04.532
Well, maybe you
missed the other ones.

35:04.533 --> 35:06.774
Oh, really? Because so
far, I haven't missed anything.

35:06.775 --> 35:08.105
You also haven't
given us anything.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.538
Megan, our terrorist
has bloodshot eyes.

35:10.539 --> 35:11.779
It's weird. (Clicks mouse)

35:11.780 --> 35:12.840
Well, maybe he's tired

35:12.841 --> 35:15.583
from the long coach
flight from Syria.

35:15.584 --> 35:18.617
Or maybe Peter sees
something that your team missed.

35:21.550 --> 35:23.551
I sent all our data to Atlanta.

35:23.552 --> 35:25.553
I can have a c.D.C.
Special pathogens team

35:25.554 --> 35:26.854
on a plane in ten minutes.

35:26.855 --> 35:28.796
Good. Do it. I'm
sick of her crap.

35:28.797 --> 35:31.799
Hello. I am right here, and
if you take us off this case,

35:31.800 --> 35:33.601
you are so screwed.

35:33.602 --> 35:35.132
Dr. Hunt, your
passion's admirable,

35:35.133 --> 35:36.864
but you work on dead bodies.

35:36.865 --> 35:38.836
You can make a mistake a
hundred times, nothing happens.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.569
When the c.D.C. Is wrong, people
die. (Peter) Why are you people

35:41.570 --> 35:43.741
so quick to ignore
what's right in front of you?

35:43.742 --> 35:44.812
He has bloodshot
eyes. (Clicks mouse)

35:44.813 --> 35:45.913
That doesn't give us our killer.

35:45.914 --> 35:47.645
Are you interested in
mode of transmission?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.647
He's not tired, okay? He's sick.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.919
Bloodshot eyes doesn't
give us mode of transmission.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.682
It's not the bloodshot
eyes. It's what they obscure.

35:54.683 --> 35:56.854
(People speaking indistinctly)

35:56.855 --> 35:58.827
The sclera are jaundiced.

35:59.928 --> 36:02.760
Liver failure?

36:02.761 --> 36:05.733
The jaundice is advanced.
He's been sick for over a week.

36:05.734 --> 36:06.864
He sure as hell

36:06.865 --> 36:08.825
isn't sticking people with
needles to infect them.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.900
Agent Johnson, Dr. Stafford,

36:12.901 --> 36:16.604
turns out you're both looking
for the exact same thing.

36:16.605 --> 36:18.746
Our terrorist is patient
zero. He infected himself first

36:18.747 --> 36:21.709
and then he turned himself
into a suicide bomber.

36:21.710 --> 36:25.183
Anyone who comes into
contact with him is going die.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.693
Transmission is
caused by direct contact

36:35.694 --> 36:37.825
with blood and secretions.

36:37.826 --> 36:39.767
Which means, we can contain it

36:39.768 --> 36:41.629
if we mobilize
everything we got.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.731
By contain it, you
mean telling people that

36:43.732 --> 36:46.604
there is a sick man out
there who is infecting people

36:46.605 --> 36:48.636
so that they can
protect themselves?

36:48.637 --> 36:51.509
No. Then he'll go underground,
and we'll never see him again.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.542
What we need is a
new public face on this,

36:54.543 --> 36:57.616
like your very photogenic boss.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.853
You do like to live on
the edge, don't you?

37:05.854 --> 37:07.625
What have you found?

37:07.626 --> 37:08.826
Elevated antibodies
in the blood,

37:08.827 --> 37:10.558
but no I.D., none.

37:10.559 --> 37:12.860
This disease is either
super rare or mutated.

37:12.861 --> 37:16.534
So go wear your scrubs.
I'm not taking that risk.

37:16.535 --> 37:17.905
No offense.

37:17.906 --> 37:20.639
None taken, big baby.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.871
What's with the suits? I
thought it wasn't airborne.

37:23.872 --> 37:25.673
Apparently, we're not
all on the same page.

37:25.674 --> 37:26.744
What did you find?

37:26.745 --> 37:27.875
Good news.

37:27.876 --> 37:30.748
The patients are stabilizing
with the antibiotics.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.850
That's not news. That's hope.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.652
Just have to wait and see.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.883
We are in the wait and see camp.

37:35.884 --> 37:39.558
Fine. Go wait and see
somewhere else, will you?

37:42.731 --> 37:44.762
How are you doing?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.564
She had this whole other life

37:46.565 --> 37:49.637
that I didn't know
anything about.

37:49.638 --> 37:51.699
A 15-year-old girl

37:51.700 --> 37:53.741
knew her better than I did.

37:53.742 --> 37:56.904
The best relationships
have some mystery.

37:56.905 --> 37:59.947
She surprised
you. You liked that.

37:59.948 --> 38:02.881
Surprise.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.618
Let's go. It's time.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.795
"I want to thank special agent
in charge Brendan Johnson

38:17.796 --> 38:19.797
"for all of his help
keeping the public safe,

38:19.798 --> 38:21.929
"and I also want to thank
Dr. Stafford and his team

38:21.930 --> 38:23.931
at c.D.C. For their
assistance and expertise."

38:23.932 --> 38:26.874
Why are you sweating, nervous?

38:26.875 --> 38:28.876
I've been better.

38:28.877 --> 38:30.978
It's not exactly
what I want to say.

38:30.979 --> 38:33.841
What are you going to say?

38:33.842 --> 38:34.982
The truth,

38:34.983 --> 38:36.914
except for mode of transmission.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.947
Ah, so everything
except what matters.

38:39.948 --> 38:41.949
Johnson's a
jerk, but he's right.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.891
This guy may not be the
only terrorist in the city.

38:43.892 --> 38:45.823
If you say nothing,
more people will die.

38:45.824 --> 38:46.954
And if I say everything,

38:46.955 --> 38:48.896
a lot more people
could die looking for him.

38:48.897 --> 38:50.728
Listen, I need to go
over this. Can I do that,

38:50.729 --> 38:51.829
or do you need to argue again?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.631
Oh, no. I'm fine. I just
came here to tell you

38:53.632 --> 38:54.932
that you're making the
biggest mistake of your career,

38:54.933 --> 38:55.963
but, no.

38:55.964 --> 38:57.806
I'm good.

39:00.669 --> 39:02.970
(Exhales deeply)

39:02.971 --> 39:04.642
Good morning.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.713
(Camera shutters clicking)

39:05.714 --> 39:06.774
I'd like to start by thanking

39:06.775 --> 39:08.776
special agent in
charge Brendan Johnson

39:08.777 --> 39:11.649
for all of his help in
keeping the public safe.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.651
I'd also like to thank
Dr. Charles Stafford

39:13.652 --> 39:14.852
and his team at c.D.C.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.654
For their help and assistance.

39:16.655 --> 39:17.725
Come on, Kate.

39:17.726 --> 39:18.926
Come on. Do the
right thing here.

39:18.927 --> 39:20.928
I want to reiterate the
importance of using

39:20.929 --> 39:22.860
basic precautions to stay
healthy. (Cell phone rings)

39:22.861 --> 39:23.931
(Beeps) Avoid touching
your eyes, nose, and mouth...

39:23.932 --> 39:24.992
Yeah.

39:24.993 --> 39:27.665
The antibiotics are not working.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.036
Ethan, I told you, we
gotta wait and see.

39:29.037 --> 39:30.738
We waited.

39:30.739 --> 39:31.939
They're all dead.

39:31.940 --> 39:33.671
(Kate) ...Close watch
on your children.

39:33.672 --> 39:34.742
No vending machines...

39:34.743 --> 39:36.804
Megan, we can't stop it.

39:36.805 --> 39:38.806
Water fountains.
(Camera shutters clicking)

39:38.807 --> 39:40.848
Wearing protective
gloves and masks

39:40.849 --> 39:43.711
will protect you and your
families from this disease.

39:43.712 --> 39:45.012
Dr. Murphy. Dr. Murphy.
(Reporters shouting indistinctly)

39:45.013 --> 39:48.015
Dr. Murphy,
Dr. Murphy, any progress

39:48.016 --> 39:50.017
on how the terrorist is
transmitting the disease?

39:50.018 --> 39:53.821
(Clicking continues)

39:53.822 --> 39:55.022
People, uh...

39:55.023 --> 39:56.994
The... the truth...

39:56.995 --> 40:00.899
(Clicking continues)

40:03.031 --> 40:04.772
(Clears throat)

40:04.773 --> 40:06.834
People, the truth is,
the terrorist is sick.

40:06.835 --> 40:09.877
(Clicking continues)

40:09.878 --> 40:11.839
He's infecting all of you

40:11.840 --> 40:14.712
and he's still out there.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.014
(Crowd gasps)
