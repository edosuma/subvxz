two minutes ago...

10:52.434 --> 10:53.870
I didn't even know

10:53.914 --> 10:55.480
that I was pregnant, right?
So you know what

10:55.524 --> 10:56.699

We're just gonna--

10:56.743 --> 10:58.396
we're gonna rewind this. Whoo.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.876
I don't know
that I'm pregnant, right?

10:59.920 --> 11:03.010
No one knows that
I am pregnant, understood?

11:03.053 --> 11:04.446
Uh-huh.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.317
All right, so

11:06.361 --> 11:10.234
back to the mission
to save Gwyn.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.672
Yeah, and protect the baby.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.066
My God, I'm pregnant.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.206
No Fixer, no Gideons.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.991
Ah, this mission
is gonna be a cinch.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.211
- Damn it.
- Are you out of your mind?

11:30.254 --> 11:33.083
- We're officially jinxed.
- I appreciated the positivity.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.476
Okay, thank you so much.
You can both shut up.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.912
All right.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.001
We're here a couple hours
before sunrise,

11:38.045 --> 11:39.960
but we don't want to attract
the attention of the Fixer.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.526
Let's find some shelter.

11:41.570 --> 11:42.702
That way.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.402
All right, well, this will work
for a base of operations.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.143
Sweep the area.
Keep your eyes peeled

11:49.186 --> 11:50.797
for the Fixer
or Evil Waverider.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.189

11:52.233 --> 11:53.625
in the middle
of a bloody battlefield.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.758
- Gideon?
- The deal we made was that

11:55.802 --> 11:57.717
you would give up
time travel forever.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.588
You aren't supposed to be here.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.285
Yeah, well,
Gwyn's not supposed to be dead.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.854

with what I gave him.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.422
This was cleaner,
the way it was meant to happen.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.816

was meant to happen?

12:09.859 --> 12:11.208
I'm supposed to be in hell.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.775
You are supposed to be
a machine.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.255
We're all from
different time lines, Gideon.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.778
And what?
Now suddenly you decide

12:15.822 --> 12:17.475

the letter of the law?

12:17.519 --> 12:18.955

12:18.999 --> 12:21.044

to save your lives.

12:21.088 --> 12:24.352
I sacrificed my own future so
that you could all enjoy yours,

12:24.395 --> 12:26.093

12:26.136 --> 12:28.617

a bag of false goods, Giddy.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.882

the airlock intentionally.

had her reasons.

That's the problem
with you Legends.

so damn personally.

Yeah.

He's just frozen.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.636
He's dead.
Yeah, uh,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.377
he had a heart attack
this morning,

22:15.421 --> 22:17.118
and he's not gonna be found
until tonight.

22:17.161 --> 22:20.208

22:32.351 --> 22:33.787
I'm from the future.

I know we're in a rush,

I don't know him.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.247
Oh, I am Dr. Gwyn Davies.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.553
Very pleased to
make your acquaintance, sir.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.598
Gwyn invented time travel.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.514
- You're that guy?
- Yeah.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.211
Oh, wow.
My bad.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.474
I thought you were
just some random time bandit.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.606
Okay.
Okay.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.782
All right, Legends.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.305
What brings you
to my neck of the woods?

23:14.349 --> 23:16.133
Uh, long story.

23:16.177 --> 23:19.136
Younger Gwyn is part of
the doomed 38th Welsh Division.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.791
And today his boyfriend,
Alun, is gonna die.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.054
Which is why Gwyn goes on
to invent time travel.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.099
So he can come back here
and save Alun.

23:25.142 --> 23:26.492
But he failed.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.407
But our Gwyn
is gonna succeed.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.321
Yes, by replacing the real
Alun with a fake one, you see?

23:30.365 --> 23:31.540
So the rest of the time loop

23:31.584 --> 23:32.933
can go on
like it's supposed to.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.456
Does that all make sense,
Mike?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.459
Not in the least.
Look, you guys are great,

23:37.503 --> 23:39.505
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart--

23:39.548 --> 23:41.550
I'm a huge fan--
but the people who put me here

23:41.594 --> 23:44.858
were pretty specific
about my duties as a Fixer.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.687
I'm supposed to make sure
poet dude dies every cycle.

23:47.730 --> 23:50.298
Anyone interferes,
they get fixed.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.821
That's just how it goes,
I'm sorry.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.476
Now hold on just a second.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.479
Now, you are here
to protect the events

23:57.523 --> 23:59.612
that led to the creation
of time travel itself, correct?

23:59.655 --> 24:01.396
Yeah, man.
I'm the best.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.180
That's why they put me here.
- Answer me this, then.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.356
If a time traveler were
to come here with the express

24:05.400 --> 24:07.750
intention of erasing
the very invention

24:07.794 --> 24:09.622
of time travel itself
from history--

24:09.665 --> 24:11.058
They would disappear
before they had the chance.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.538
- Precisely.
- It's a paradox.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.191
- A paradox.
- So what you're telling me

24:14.235 --> 24:17.456
is that this fixed point
could actually fix itself?

24:17.499 --> 24:20.067
Theoretically, yes,
because how else

24:20.110 --> 24:22.199
would the other time travelers
get here?

24:23.984 --> 24:26.290
Excuse me one second.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.684
That's why nobody
ever comes here.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.339
I thought it was because,
you know, people were scared

24:31.382 --> 24:33.384
that they would have to run
into me, and nobody wants

24:33.428 --> 24:34.995
to come at me.
I'm the best, right?

24:35.038 --> 24:36.779
But no,
it's because no time traveler

24:36.823 --> 24:39.478
in their right mind
would ever come to this event.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.218
Precisely.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.525
Those dicks put me here
as a joke.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.744
They did.
No, they did!

24:44.787 --> 24:46.180
- No.
- I've been played.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.443
I got played.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.280
There's an hour before
the shelling starts.

24:59.323 --> 25:02.370
Then Alun's division gets
pinned down in no man's land.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.459
And then that's when Mike
is gonna freeze time.
