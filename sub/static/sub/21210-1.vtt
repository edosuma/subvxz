01:39.466 --> 01:41.100
- State your name.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.751
State your name.

02:06.993 --> 02:08.961
- Torkul of darkhaven.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.770
- Address?

02:18.772 --> 02:23.842
- You may address
me as abelsworth.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.916
Lord of the high wind.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.853
- Is that also known as
1205 Washington Lane?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.755
- Surely you jest.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.424
The realm of darkhaven,
where we all reside.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.659
- Do you take drugs?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.461
- If you're trying
with your evil tricks

02:42.463 --> 02:44.763
it will not work with me, sir.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.498
- Come on man, we're not
gonna bust you for that.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.499
You're not here for that.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.034
Do you take drugs?

02:49.036 --> 02:51.436
- Golden paladin needs no
mind-altering substances

02:51.438 --> 02:53.438
to complete his quest.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.508
- Do you take prescription
medications of any kind?

02:56.510 --> 02:59.144
- I am not any of the clerics.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.883
Mystical winds.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.352
- Do you drink?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.788
- Of course not, not when
my quest is still underway.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.823
- What is your mission?

03:16.095 --> 03:20.399
- To rid the realm of the
13 demons of the apocalypse.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.610
May I go now?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.746
- I am golden paladin
of the knight's order

03:34.748 --> 03:36.281
of the high wind.

03:36.283 --> 03:40.152
Once I have completed their
destruction and annihilation,

03:40.154 --> 03:42.354
I will have freed the realm,

03:42.356 --> 03:46.458
and I will have brought
peace to all man kind.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.426
- Why 13?

03:49.862 --> 03:53.832
- It's a sacred number
written down in the tomes.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.334
It's taught through all of time.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.837
- You know that we've had 12
murders in the last month?

03:58.839 --> 04:02.007
- I do not care about murders.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.644
If they are but of the
quest, they matter.

04:06.779 --> 04:09.114
- And this is all
part of your mission?

04:09.116 --> 04:11.917
- Yes, I must complete my quest.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.225
- So when you say
demons, you mean humans?

04:22.095 --> 04:25.964
- I've grown tired.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.402
I've grown tired of
your questioning.

04:32.605 --> 04:36.375
The demons are the ones
that have held us back.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.810
- As foretold in the
tomes to bring forth

04:38.812 --> 04:40.479
the end of everything is--

04:40.481 --> 04:41.947
- what did you kill them with?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.450
- I killed them with the
anointed dagger of bastooge.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.918
- You mean this?

04:47.820 --> 04:48.787
A stick.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.356
- My weapon, you have it.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.058
May I have it back, please?

04:53.060 --> 04:55.360
Sacred scimitar of azcarden.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.595
- Is this it?

04:58.064 --> 04:59.031
A pipe.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.270
- A pipe, you fool?

05:05.272 --> 05:08.740
Your eyes look upon a
sacred relic all time

05:08.742 --> 05:11.410
and you see a simple pipe?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.445
- Please, I can see
you are a noble man,

05:13.447 --> 05:14.680
I can see that in your eye.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.214
Please give me my weapon.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.450
I am on a divine quest.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.418
- No.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.957
- This the kind of men
you have in your kingdom?

05:25.959 --> 05:28.560
- I understand little
of this inquiry.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.129
Little of your
advantages towards me.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.900
Why will you not release
me from this elven dungeon?

05:34.902 --> 05:37.269
- Recognize this fella?

05:37.271 --> 05:38.403
November 15.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.073
Killed Dickie Collins.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.842
- Yes.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.512
He was the one who
welcomed us to this realm.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.147
He set this all into motion.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.717
- He was the Shepherd
of the high wind.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.185
He brought us in.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.954
- Before the prophecy,
as foretold in the tomes.

05:55.956 --> 06:00.258
- He showed us the ways to
kill the demonic citadels.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.466
- Why?

06:18.311 --> 06:19.277
Why?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.492
Challenge accepted.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.860
- Hey guys.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.562
Hey, you'll never guess what.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.397
You'll never guess.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.799
Shit, dude, I'm sorry man.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.101
Look, no, no, no.
- God damn it, dude.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.637
Challenge accepted.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.939
- God damn it, man, I've
been playin' Bridges and

06:47.941 --> 06:49.174
fuckin' knights for 12 hours.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.776
God damn it, dude, fuck!

06:50.778 --> 06:51.877
- Listen, listen.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.178
- You know how
pristine I keep my set.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.446
- All right, what is
so god damn important

06:54.448 --> 06:55.947
you gotta come in
here kickin' shit?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.516
I'm right in the middle of
gettin' to the reaper here,

06:57.518 --> 06:58.717
I've never gotten that far,

06:58.719 --> 06:59.918
this is dragon lair,
for god's sake,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.019
you know what this
shit is like, come on!

07:01.021 --> 07:02.788
- This is better.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.702
- What the hell is this, dude?

07:17.704 --> 07:18.837
- 13 demons.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.810
I mean, you remember?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.481
You don't remember,
the game, the game,

07:29.483 --> 07:32.117
30 years ago it was banned.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.453
People who played it, they
got so obsessed with it

07:34.455 --> 07:37.189
they started killin'
other people and shit.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.724
They actually thought that
they were these characters

07:39.726 --> 07:40.759
in the game.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.127
It was like dark ages, man.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.328
I mean, they threw it
all on the streets, man.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.930
They burned 'em and shit.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.465
You don't remember this?

07:46.467 --> 07:49.668
- I mean, rest assured, if
it was worth remembering,

07:49.670 --> 07:52.671
I would remember it,
but I don't remember it.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.806
- They don't even fuckin'
spell demons right.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.543
- This is fucking rare,
man, this is huge!

08:00.180 --> 08:02.047
I mean, check it out.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.290
- This smells, man.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.800
It's got a castle.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.101
- Where did you get it?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.103
- Argon's, argon's.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.271
Old man argon, you know,

08:26.273 --> 08:27.772
his bookstore's goin'
out of business.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.474
You know Janet, you know, the
senile, his wife, you know?

08:29.476 --> 08:30.709
- Oh.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.577
- Isn't she like the one
with the wizard sleeve

08:32.578 --> 08:34.179
and all that?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.881
- Dude, she sold it to
me for like two bucks,

08:36.884 --> 08:38.049
she doesn't know anything

08:38.051 --> 08:39.551
about the dark
origin of this game.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.318
I can't even believe that
old man argon even had this.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.953
- 13 demons, dude.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.358
I mean.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.993
I mean, it sounds like a
throw back metal hair band

08:47.995 --> 08:48.960
from 1984.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.499
- This is die cast.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.634
This shit's quality.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.035
- Yeah, and where's the shoe?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.003
- Take a look at
this crap now, man.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.571
Look, it's heavy.

09:01.507 --> 09:02.641
- Ooh.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.479
- There was much
rejoicing, yay!

09:07.481 --> 09:09.314
I don't know, man.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.584
- Dude, let me see that, man.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.719
- What else is in there?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.790
- Smells old.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.362
Looks old.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.435
Looks dumb.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.575
And it's all moldy, it's not.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.077
It's not even that old, dude.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.145
Nah.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.546
- Does it say made in Taiwan?

09:43.283 --> 09:44.249
Oh.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.453
That's some jumanji shit.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.442
- God damn.
- Ugh.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.079
- Oh, what is that shit?

10:15.514 --> 10:17.382
- It's the rule book.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.520
- That's the rule book?

10:25.891 --> 10:27.425
- You wanna play?

10:41.107 --> 10:42.073
Um.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.350
I think there's.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.756
Wait a minute, hold on.

11:01.193 --> 11:04.562
- Do you even know
where we start from?

11:05.865 --> 11:10.101
- Well yeah, yeah, you can
start on any of the, um.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.803
Uh, any of the, eh.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.976
Wait no, wait hold
on one second.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.311
Like reading this stuff,
it's like reading beowulf,

11:20.313 --> 11:24.783
you know, I mean.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.186
Okay, so we are,
we're golden paladins,

11:29.422 --> 11:31.690
we can start at any
corner in our realm.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.857
- These are the realms.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.026
- Yes, every four
corner, that's a realm.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.128
So when we kill all of
our demons in our realm,

11:37.130 --> 11:39.330
we can meet in the middle,

11:39.332 --> 11:41.399
but we cannot enter
the citadel yet

11:41.401 --> 11:43.601
where the king is imprisoned.

11:43.603 --> 11:47.038
See, I mean, it's a lot easier
if we're playin' with four.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.540
- So where do we
start from, though?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.442
- You can start anywhere
here, I believe,

11:50.444 --> 11:53.945
it's the closest gray
block from any corner,

11:53.947 --> 11:56.715
you can pick, but it has
to be in your own domain.

11:56.717 --> 12:00.018
- So we put these
little army men dude

12:01.087 --> 12:02.954
on the triangle?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.189
- These are forests.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.824
- Well, what's up with
the triangles, then?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.092
- Well, you can't
go through 'em.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.593
- Why can't we go
through the forest?

12:08.595 --> 12:10.095
- I don't now, it's just
like every game board,

12:10.097 --> 12:11.796
they have to make it more
entertaining and stuff.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.264
You know, it's like why are
there little Bridges here?

12:13.266 --> 12:14.933
It's just to make it more
pleasurable, I guess.

12:14.935 --> 12:19.304
So you go there, actually,
no you go right there

12:19.306 --> 12:22.907
because you cannot be right
next to those red things.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.309
- So what are the reds, then?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.377
- Those are the demon bases.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.879
- Demon base.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.681
I heard some demon bass
on a track the other day.

12:29.683 --> 12:30.715
It was sweet.

12:30.717 --> 12:31.649
I don't like this, though.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.951
That was more interesting, that.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.755
- So, first off, we kill
each of those 13 demons

12:36.757 --> 12:39.224
outside of any of the other
lollygagging that we do

12:39.226 --> 12:41.392
through these events, through
the valley of whatever,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.394
discontent, and yada yada yada.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.863
- I know, it's like a
choose your own adventure.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.865
- Then do we absorb
their souls or something?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.133
Is this tekken?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.100
What are we doing?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.368
- So this is how it works.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.736
So here I am, I'm
on my orange circle,

12:51.738 --> 12:54.806
it says you come
to dead druid pass.

12:57.209 --> 13:00.145
You see many boulders that
is blocking your entrance

13:00.147 --> 13:02.380
to the demon base.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.648
- Demon base.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.884
- Your only options
are to turn right--

13:05.886 --> 13:07.819
- the fuck around.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.555
- Look, I know these rules,
they're silly and everything,

13:10.557 --> 13:11.756
but come on, we can at least say

13:11.758 --> 13:14.325
that we're playing 13 demons.

13:15.261 --> 13:18.296
The game that's banned,
that was burned.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.364
Lives were.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.271
You know what I mean?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.205
It's like Everest.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.507
You know, you gotta try it.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.312
- I'm so confused, man.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.380
- Whatever.

13:44.758 --> 13:45.723
- No, I.

13:48.794 --> 13:52.864
It has this odd aroma and
my olfactory's all screwy,

13:52.866 --> 13:55.300
but it kinda smells like

13:55.302 --> 13:59.604
this thing's been buried
under like burned leaves.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.341
- I know, I know.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.742
Yeah, it does stink a little.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.578
I thought that, too.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.246
- Okay, but I do
smell it, all right?

14:08.248 --> 14:09.747
- Well it's an old game.

14:09.749 --> 14:13.151
I mean this is the game our
grandfathers played with.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.953
- Do you smell it?

14:14.955 --> 14:19.257
Like more intensely than you
did like maybe two minutes ago?

14:20.292 --> 14:22.260
- I got somethin' you
can smell intensely.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.429
- No, that's.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.764
- Is it getting stronger?

14:26.766 --> 14:28.233
- Dude, yes.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.134
- I mean, I don't
mind the smell.

14:30.136 --> 14:30.969
- I don't know, dude.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.605
Smell my fuckin', here.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.839
- I like this better.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.341
Oh, oh, shit.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.876
- Yeah, no, that's.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.510
- Fuck it, come on guys,
let's just play, man.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.313
Let's just do one
step at a time,

14:42.315 --> 14:45.283
and let's fuckin' play
man, let's do this.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.251

Son of a bitch.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.514

into another monster.

monster, anything like that.

than the game though, man.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.201

17:50.036 --> 17:54.072
- You convert the crowns
into silver platinum togards.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.441
- You just entered
into the grand gala

17:56.443 --> 18:00.745
of the eagle silver man,
and the eagle silver woman.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.667
- How long have we fuckin'
been playin' for, man?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.302
- What time is it?

18:25.337 --> 18:29.474
- Oh, about, two days,
it feels like.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.244
- Hey, can I hit your
Basilisk, by the way.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.178
- Yeah man, yeah.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.280

18:37.416 --> 18:41.152

having fun, right?

18:43.288 --> 18:47.191
- I mean, we're close
to our demon bases, so.

18:50.762 --> 18:51.662
Let's just play until that, man,

18:51.664 --> 18:53.064
and we'll call it quits.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.398
Let's just get
somewhere in this game.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.201
Let's just complete a goal, so.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.169
All right.

that those people died.

26:41.733 --> 26:42.700

Where were we in this, is it?

We left off with you, right?

26:48.541 --> 26:49.873
- Hm?

26:49.875 --> 26:50.841
- No.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.180
It's not yours, is it?

26:58.350 --> 26:59.249
- Huh?

26:59.251 --> 27:00.484
- You.

27:00.486 --> 27:03.687
You got to the demon
base last night, right?

27:03.689 --> 27:05.990

27:07.392 --> 27:08.759
I had to go across the pass.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.728
- The pass.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.596
Yeah dude, you were
on the citadel.

27:12.598 --> 27:14.999
- Yeah, I got to the demon.

Yeah.

27:21.539 --> 27:22.840
What the hell?

27:29.114 --> 27:31.115
No, that one was
always that color?

27:31.117 --> 27:34.084
- No, when's this
game from, like?

27:36.254 --> 27:38.622
The 70s, yeah, man.

27:38.624 --> 27:42.326
It's like a fuckin'
mood ring or some shit.

27:48.366 --> 27:49.967
- When'd they make mood rings?

27:49.969 --> 27:51.201
What year was that made?

27:51.203 --> 27:52.936
- Same year as the
pet rock, dude.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.174
- That's pretty
cool, though, man.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.308
- Fuck yeah.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.078
Hey boys, let's see what
else this thing does.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.312
I mean, if it does that
shit without tellin' you,

28:02.314 --> 28:05.115
let's see what else
it does.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.350
- All right, you're up, man.

28:19.264 --> 28:21.832
Vanquishing your first demon.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.935
Victory is well earned,

28:24.937 --> 28:28.472
however your journey
is not yet complete.

28:30.241 --> 28:34.545
To meet your fate, you must
first advance to the next quest.

28:44.122 --> 28:46.990
You find yourself
standing on a hill

28:46.992 --> 28:49.460
covered with scorched brush.

28:51.696 --> 28:52.663
The trees

28:55.700 --> 28:58.402
around you are black skeletons,

28:59.370 --> 29:02.473
brown, shriveled skins dangling

29:02.475 --> 29:06.510
where once the branches
dipped with red apples.

29:08.379 --> 29:12.116
The sky's a sea of red,
choking with smoke.

29:13.651 --> 29:15.853
Your village lay in ruin.

29:15.855 --> 29:19.990
Demons chase young children
through the streets.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.827
Sound of wailing fills the air.

29:25.396 --> 29:28.499
You hear cracks like thunder.

29:28.501 --> 29:32.035
Armies of demons riding
across the realm,

29:32.971 --> 29:36.406
war, famine, pestilence,
tragedy, misery,

29:38.309 --> 29:41.712
cut down your people
wherever you look.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.651
Horrified, you raise
from your nightmare.

29:47.653 --> 29:51.121
You fly past the ruined
trees of blasted earth

29:51.123 --> 29:55.425
and heaven has opened up and
frozen with rain pelt you.

29:56.728 --> 30:01.031
Winds strike at you and may
fight you like a feather.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.271
Whoa, that's some heavy shit.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.238
- Yeah.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.345
- To advance,

30:17.448 --> 30:20.184
you must roll a four or higher.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.090
Roll to continue.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.194
Fulfill your destiny.

30:38.636 --> 30:40.904
- Fulfill that destiny.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.973
- I'm gonna fulfill it.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.644
- This is getting better, man.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.690
- Oh.

30:59.692 --> 31:00.657
Your turn.

31:04.562 --> 31:05.529
- Oh, um.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.033
You guys want a snort?

31:14.105 --> 31:15.439
- Nah man, I'm good.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.841
Let's just play the game.

31:17.843 --> 31:19.643
- Okay, yeah.

31:19.645 --> 31:20.878
Sure.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.246
- Yeah,
I'll have some.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.480
- No man, no.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.617
No, thanks, no.

31:28.753 --> 31:29.853
Let's just play the game man.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.588
Let's keep playing.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.558
All right, all right?

31:35.927 --> 31:37.394
Cool, all right.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.468
Okay, um, so.

31:47.005 --> 31:50.073
Paladins enter upon
the magic room.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.676
The master speaks.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.981
In my foolish enthusiasm i
blurted out the plans to you

31:57.983 --> 32:00.284
while you were on
your way to collect

32:00.286 --> 32:04.521
the henna rope from the
wise woman of the viborg.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.491
Viborg, or viborg.

32:15.733 --> 32:16.700
Viborg.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.779
I'm really sorry,
I'm sorry, that was.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.483
That was uncalled for.

32:34.218 --> 32:35.585
Viborg.

32:35.587 --> 32:38.221
I didn't mean to
mispronounce it.

32:38.223 --> 32:39.356
Can we continue?

32:39.358 --> 32:40.824
- Yeah.

32:40.826 --> 32:41.992
Okay.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.193
- I won't make
that mistake again.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.594
I'm sorry, I'm
really sorry, guys.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.129
- That's okay.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.197
- Okay, um.

33:03.114 --> 33:05.882
Upon retrieval of the power gem,

33:05.884 --> 33:09.419
remember, before you
forget your loyalty,

33:12.790 --> 33:16.493
you wouldn't prompt to
insist on remaining with me,

33:16.495 --> 33:20.330
be sure, for your survival
of capturing of the power gem

33:20.332 --> 33:22.366
to displace all demons.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.005
I.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.477
It says I have to
roll a four or higher.

33:42.754 --> 33:43.720
Six.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.961
We're in the
demon town now, man.

33:50.963 --> 33:52.462
- We're paladins.

33:52.464 --> 33:56.333
- I am sorry about before,
talking shit about this game,

33:56.335 --> 33:59.069
but this is a really good game.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.073
This is a really good game.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.307
This is a really good game.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.675
I'm serious, it's
a really good game,

34:05.677 --> 34:07.310
it's a really good game, guys.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.079
This is entirely a good game.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.715
I, this is a really good game.

34:13.117 --> 34:16.853
This is a really,
really, really good game.

34:36.306 --> 34:37.274
- Wow.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.476
How about that.

36:01.492 --> 36:02.993
- The body of an
unidentified man

36:02.995 --> 36:04.961
was found in the parking
lot of an office park

36:04.963 --> 36:06.463
on the southeast side.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.964
Sources say his face
was so badly beaten,

36:07.966 --> 36:11.001
he will have to be
identified by fingerprints

36:11.003 --> 36:12.869
or dental records.

36:12.871 --> 36:17.174
Anyone with information is
asked to call silent observer.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.534
- Go in Harmony, paladin.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.270
And seek thine balance
of the gray lore

36:47.272 --> 36:50.273
through the stone walls
of the paladin's new home.

36:50.275 --> 36:51.841
As they begin to disappear,

36:51.843 --> 36:54.878
shadows grew beyond the
gleam of the crystals,

36:54.880 --> 36:58.348
descending on the chests
and shelves of books

36:58.350 --> 37:01.318
within the table
of the gray lord.

37:06.924 --> 37:10.894
Paladins debated ancient
philosophies, Grant--

37:11.896 --> 37:15.632
- why do you always
misread the sacred book?

37:17.602 --> 37:19.903
It's a form of disrespect.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.811
What is wrong with you?

37:32.516 --> 37:34.084
You're reading like a child.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.086
- Dude, it's paladin.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.255
- P-p-p-p-p-paladin, paladin.

37:38.257 --> 37:41.925
T-t-t-t-treasure,
g-g-g-g-golden golden

37:41.927 --> 37:43.493
c-c-c-crown, crown, crowns.

37:43.495 --> 37:46.062
We have been playing
this for many days.

37:46.064 --> 37:49.432
The least you could
do is show respect.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.805
What kind of person are you?

38:02.380 --> 38:03.446
Am I right?

38:06.984 --> 38:07.817
- Are you--

38:07.819 --> 38:08.885
- language.

38:10.655 --> 38:13.023
- Dude, what the
fuck is your problem?

38:13.025 --> 38:14.991
- You sound like a
drunken bavarian ogre.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.626
- We're just tryin' to
get along here, all right?

38:16.628 --> 38:17.994
- It doesn't even matter,
it doesn't even matter.

38:17.996 --> 38:21.031
Just continue r-r-r-reading.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.532
- I respect this realm.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.366
- Continue.

38:23.368 --> 38:24.200
- I do.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.435
- Continue.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.904
- Don't tell me
what to do, okay?

38:32.977 --> 38:33.943
- Please.

38:36.981 --> 38:37.947
- Okay.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.018
Paladin.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.294
At the stone walls
of the paladin,

38:52.430 --> 38:54.898
proceed to the inner circle.

38:54.900 --> 38:58.234
Join thine brethren
paladin as you watch for

38:58.236 --> 39:01.237
the wizard and his open arms.

39:01.239 --> 39:03.273
Collect 100 gold piece.

39:09.647 --> 39:10.613
Man.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.218
There, okay?

39:29.166 --> 39:31.167
- Where's my dice?

39:35.673 --> 39:37.907
Where's my dice, my dice was
right here, now it's gone.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.142
- Are you fucking kidding me?

39:39.144 --> 39:40.810
- What do you mean
you lost your dice?

39:40.812 --> 39:43.580
You're so careless, man,
why do you always lose shit?

39:43.582 --> 39:45.081
I mean, you take
enough time already,

39:45.083 --> 39:47.317
you lose your way all
across the realms,

39:47.319 --> 39:49.619
yet you still can't
hold onto anything,

39:49.621 --> 39:53.523
and yet you claim that we
have no respect for this game?

39:53.525 --> 39:55.024
- Okay, this is
what I mean by like

39:55.026 --> 39:58.094
not respecting what
we're trying to do.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.629
Why can't you be more prepared?

39:59.631 --> 40:00.463
I mean--

40:00.465 --> 40:02.098
- did you take it?

40:07.638 --> 40:09.506
Did you take my dice?

40:11.375 --> 40:12.675
- I have mine.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.178
I've been holding onto it.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.480
When I throw it down, i
find out where it goes,

40:17.482 --> 40:21.284
count how many dots are
on it, and I grab it.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.586
- And you claim yourself to
be a golden paladin warrior

40:23.588 --> 40:25.321
and you can't even
remember where your dice is

40:25.323 --> 40:29.626
and you have the audacity to
blame others in your own quest.

40:40.371 --> 40:41.805
- Thick as thieves, you are.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.740
- Look, you are slipping, man.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.475
- I'm gonna ask you again.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.343
Did you take my dice?

40:47.345 --> 40:49.913
I am looking at you, not you.

40:52.850 --> 40:53.817
You.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.090
- No, man, what the fuck.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.258
Come on.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.794
Let's just be civilized here.

41:11.669 --> 41:13.303
- Oh, false alarm.

41:17.107 --> 41:18.708
Very sorry.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.944
I am sorry, I am sorry.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.379
I didn't mean to
accuse any of you.

41:23.381 --> 41:26.182
You are not thieves, all
is right in the order.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.650
The brotherhood.

41:29.453 --> 41:30.420
Right?

41:32.623 --> 41:33.590
Right?

41:34.325 --> 41:35.792
Can we continue?

41:38.329 --> 41:39.295
Oh, god.

41:44.802 --> 41:48.738
As I approach the barbarian,
he drew himself up.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.341
Listen, he shouts,
child of nature,

41:51.343 --> 41:52.709
I have done my part.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.444
I have practiced my skills.

41:54.446 --> 41:57.146
I am the only
journeyman in this land.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.983
The only way to get to
your first demon citadel

41:59.985 --> 42:02.552
is by taking the path the left.

42:02.554 --> 42:06.856
The path to the right, to the
frozen caverns of morgash.

42:07.925 --> 42:11.561
Roll a three, you take
the path on the right.

42:11.563 --> 42:15.298
Roll a four, you take
the path on the left.

43:03.447 --> 43:05.415
Would you like a dram?

43:06.750 --> 43:08.418
- Do not lie to us, paladin.

43:08.420 --> 43:11.888
Do not bring mistrust
within this group.

45:30.027 --> 45:31.828
- You've
reached the carpenters.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.062
Leave a message after the tone

45:33.064 --> 45:34.764
and we'll get back to
you as soon as possible.

45:34.766 --> 45:35.598
Thank you.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.634
- Hello, mother.

45:38.636 --> 45:39.936
Hello, father.

45:42.339 --> 45:44.540
I come bearing good news.

45:46.810 --> 45:50.179
I'm now a member of
the knight's order.

45:51.415 --> 45:55.351
A part of the brotherhood,
the golden paladins,

45:56.420 --> 45:57.920
the chosen ones.

45:57.922 --> 46:02.125
The chosen ones to vanquish
all evil from this realm.

46:04.161 --> 46:05.628
This is my destiny.

46:05.630 --> 46:07.730
I know you always
haven't been proud of me,

46:07.732 --> 46:12.034
but finally, I found my way
in life, I found my light.

46:14.838 --> 46:17.039
I go into battle tonight.

46:19.710 --> 46:24.013
There is a good chance,
though, that I may not return.

46:26.950 --> 46:30.353
If I do not return,
think better of me.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.125
Think better of me, for
i have brought honor

46:36.127 --> 46:37.827
to our family name.

46:46.603 --> 46:47.637
I love you.

47:43.126 --> 47:45.194
Look at me, foul demon.

47:53.604 --> 47:55.071
- Dude, we're closed.

47:55.073 --> 47:57.607
I'm just tryin' to finish up.

48:02.179 --> 48:03.546
Dude, we're closing.

48:03.548 --> 48:04.914
I just wanna go home.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.816
Can you please leave?

48:14.491 --> 48:16.626
We're closed, all right?

48:31.241 --> 48:33.442
- Please decrease
your level of interest

48:33.444 --> 48:35.845
from that metal chariot.

48:35.847 --> 48:39.582
For I am one of the golden
paladins of the knight's order.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.050
- Dude, what the fuck?
- A divine one.

48:41.052 --> 48:42.351
- Hey dick, looks like
you got everything done

48:42.353 --> 48:44.020
but the paperwork, again.

48:44.022 --> 48:45.788
- I've
come to slay thee,

48:45.790 --> 48:46.956
foul demon of the apocalypse.

48:46.958 --> 48:47.790
- What's this then?

48:47.792 --> 48:48.624
- Fight me.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.293
Fight me, you filth.

48:50.295 --> 48:51.894
Fight me.

48:51.896 --> 48:54.330
Fight me, if you're so bold.

48:56.199 --> 48:57.433
- What's this?

48:57.435 --> 49:00.202
- Some crazy fuckin'
pothead, I don't know.

49:00.204 --> 49:01.537
- Well get him outta here.

49:01.539 --> 49:02.772
- Dude, fuckin' leave.

49:02.774 --> 49:05.341
- Are you ready to do
battle, foul demon?

49:05.343 --> 49:07.977
Remove yourself from the
confines of your citadel

49:07.979 --> 49:09.078
and approach me.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.279
- You wanna fuckin' go?

49:10.281 --> 49:12.615
- You're as cowardly
as you are ugly.

49:12.617 --> 49:14.083
- Dude, keep going, I dare you.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.351
Keep fucking going.

49:15.353 --> 49:17.420
- You're as gutless
as your bitch mother

49:17.422 --> 49:20.823
that gave birth to you
from the depths of Hades.

49:20.825 --> 49:21.924
- What did you just say to me?

49:21.926 --> 49:23.359
- Flee before me.

49:23.361 --> 49:27.063
Flee back to oblivion to
suckle on your mother's teat.

49:27.065 --> 49:29.198
- The fuck did you
say about my mother?

49:29.200 --> 49:32.501
- Go back to oblivion to
suck on your mother's teat.

49:32.503 --> 49:33.602
- I'll fuckin' kill you, dude.

49:33.604 --> 49:35.805
- Prepare for combat.

50:59.890 --> 51:01.524
- Police are
blaming the recent murders

51:01.526 --> 51:04.560
on an insurgence of the
fantasy role-playing board game

51:04.562 --> 51:05.528
13 demons.

51:06.630 --> 51:08.130
The game was banned 30 years ago

51:08.132 --> 51:10.099
due to excessively
violent murders

51:10.101 --> 51:11.467
perpetrated by players

51:11.469 --> 51:14.503
who were convinced they
were living in the game.

51:14.505 --> 51:16.205
When questioned, the players
admitted to the murders,

51:16.207 --> 51:18.174
stating they were slaying demons

51:18.176 --> 51:20.509
in order to advance in the game.

51:20.511 --> 51:23.212
Victims were killed by blunt
force trauma to the head.

51:23.214 --> 51:26.148
One suspect stated, we must
strike them in the head

51:26.150 --> 51:28.317
because demons have no hearts.

51:28.319 --> 51:29.785
Police here on the
scene of a fatal beating

51:29.787 --> 51:31.420
on the city's southeast side.

51:31.422 --> 51:32.655
They found the body of
a man who had suffered

51:32.657 --> 51:35.057
many blows to the head and body.

51:35.059 --> 51:36.826
The suspect was covered
in what appeared to be

51:36.828 --> 51:39.528
body armor made from
household items.

51:39.530 --> 51:41.764
His femoral artery had
been severed in the attack

51:41.766 --> 51:43.365
and bled to death at the scene.

51:43.367 --> 51:45.034
When police arrived,
his last words

51:45.036 --> 51:47.570
were about failing his mission.

51:47.572 --> 51:50.005
An unidentified man was
found on the sidewalk

51:50.007 --> 51:51.841
at 1205 first street.

51:51.843 --> 51:53.542
Neighbors said they
heard a lot of yelling

51:53.544 --> 51:55.044
and reported fighting
and shouting,

51:55.046 --> 51:59.148
I kill ye demon, we are
the knights of the realm!

52:47.030 --> 52:48.664
- Please release me
from this dungeon.

52:48.666 --> 52:49.632
- It's not gonna happen.

52:49.634 --> 52:51.133
- Release me from my bonds.

52:51.135 --> 52:52.434
- No!

52:52.436 --> 52:53.702
- I've had enough
of your insolence.

52:53.704 --> 52:55.905
You'll suffer me
like I am a fool.

52:55.907 --> 52:57.640
You are a fool for
keeping me here.

52:57.642 --> 53:00.743
I am trapped when i
should be out there

53:00.745 --> 53:02.111
saving your realms!

53:02.113 --> 53:04.747
- You kill innocent
people, asshole!

53:09.152 --> 53:12.855
- I will not waste my time
with your elven tribe.

53:12.857 --> 53:15.391
- This person deserve to die?

53:16.293 --> 53:17.860
- Yes.

53:17.862 --> 53:18.694
- And this one?

53:18.696 --> 53:19.695
- Yes.

53:19.697 --> 53:20.629
- What about this one?
- Yes.

53:20.631 --> 53:21.397
- So this one had to die?

53:21.399 --> 53:22.364
- Yes.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.465
- This guy.
- Indeed.

53:23.467 --> 53:24.300
- And this one?

53:24.302 --> 53:25.201
- Yes.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.035
- This one?
- Yes.

53:26.037 --> 53:26.835
- And that one?
- Yes.

53:26.837 --> 53:27.636
- We got this guy.

53:27.638 --> 53:28.470
- Yes.

53:28.472 --> 53:29.405
- And this one.

53:29.407 --> 53:32.007
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

53:33.710 --> 53:35.844
- A five year old child!

53:41.818 --> 53:44.186
- He was not a boy anymore.

53:45.522 --> 53:49.358
He was at least a gremlin,
with wing boots of silver.

53:52.063 --> 53:55.698
- Fasted demon I had seen
in all of the 26 realms.

53:55.700 --> 53:57.099
- A five year old kid?

53:57.101 --> 53:59.501
- We could not catch
one of these lightly,

53:59.503 --> 54:02.905
this was a major victory,
this was a supreme triumph,

54:02.907 --> 54:06.609
and you wave it in my
face as if it is nothing,

54:06.611 --> 54:08.410
where I am saving your realm.

54:08.412 --> 54:10.212
- You recognize him?

54:12.983 --> 54:15.117
- Yes, he is my comrade.

54:16.186 --> 54:17.419
Was.

54:17.421 --> 54:18.487
- Do you know this guy?

54:18.489 --> 54:20.289
- He is no friend of mine.

54:20.291 --> 54:21.323
- So what were
you fighting over?

54:21.325 --> 54:22.558
Girls, drugs?

54:23.827 --> 54:25.060
Money?

54:25.062 --> 54:28.097
Why do you wanna
kill your friend?

54:28.099 --> 54:32.801
- He was my comrade, he is now
the final demon I must slay

54:32.803 --> 54:34.603
to complete my mission.

54:34.605 --> 54:35.838
Is he here?

54:35.840 --> 54:37.006
- Well look, that's
none of your business.

54:37.008 --> 54:38.807
That's our business.

54:40.644 --> 54:41.677
- I sense he's here.

54:41.679 --> 54:43.245
- Do you not understand?

54:43.247 --> 54:45.681
His quest was impure.

54:45.683 --> 54:46.949
- Damn straight, bitch.

54:46.951 --> 54:50.686
- He's the last demon,
and I must kill him.

54:50.688 --> 54:52.354
I must kill him.

54:52.356 --> 54:54.456
- So he's number 13.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.391
- Yes.

54:55.393 --> 54:57.459
I would like to see him, please.

54:57.461 --> 54:58.427
- No.

55:00.363 --> 55:02.464
- Then at least let
me have my weapon.

55:02.466 --> 55:03.299
- No.

55:03.301 --> 55:04.199
- I besiege you, sir.

55:04.201 --> 55:05.367
Give me my weapon.

55:05.369 --> 55:06.302
- No!

55:06.304 --> 55:07.236
- May I have my weapon, please?

55:07.238 --> 55:08.470
- You can repeat yourself

55:08.472 --> 55:10.873
till you get redder in
the face, motherfucker.

55:10.875 --> 55:12.574
- Where is my weapon?

56:26.216 --> 56:27.616
- Three
bodies were found overnight

56:27.618 --> 56:29.251
in the city's southeast side.

56:29.253 --> 56:30.953
They were all found
near their cars

56:30.955 --> 56:33.355
and had suffered fatal
blows to the head.

56:33.357 --> 56:36.458
Neighbors in the area are
scared to leave their houses.

56:36.460 --> 56:37.860
Police believe these
murders are linked

56:37.862 --> 56:39.895
to the board game killer.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.096
- Family
members gathered

56:41.098 --> 56:43.899
waiting for any
news from the lead.

57:06.891 --> 57:08.190
- The bodies
of a five year old boy

57:08.192 --> 57:10.058
and his mother were
found early this morning

57:10.060 --> 57:11.293
in bakerswood.

57:11.295 --> 57:12.761
I hear that they were
bludgeoned to death

57:12.763 --> 57:15.431
with a large stick found nearby.

57:15.433 --> 57:16.665
The police are getting closer

57:16.667 --> 57:19.034
to locating the
killer or killers.

57:19.036 --> 57:21.837
It's a parent's worst nightmare.

57:33.250 --> 57:35.017
- Yield, yield!

57:35.019 --> 57:35.951
Yield.

57:37.887 --> 57:38.854
Yield.

57:44.194 --> 57:45.160
Yield.

57:48.698 --> 57:51.733
I just need rations
for my soldier.

58:00.176 --> 58:02.644
- Very well, take your rest.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.681
But at least show some
respect for this quest

58:05.683 --> 58:08.383
and your weapon and sheathe it.

58:15.092 --> 58:16.992
- You mock me.

58:16.994 --> 58:18.894
With a head so clear.

58:18.896 --> 58:22.130
No, your head is full of
rubyroot smoke, it is.

58:22.132 --> 58:24.600
- I have been pure since
day one of this quest,

58:24.602 --> 58:26.101
dear paladin brother.

58:26.103 --> 58:28.203
- You have not been pure,

58:28.205 --> 58:31.540
you have been touched by
the maiden's wizard sleeve.

58:31.542 --> 58:32.875
- I am pure!

58:32.877 --> 58:35.410
I have been pure since
day one of this quest.

58:35.412 --> 58:38.747
Dare you challenge
the validity of this?

58:38.749 --> 58:40.015
- Pure.

58:40.017 --> 58:41.683
- Pure, as pure as
a paladin could be

58:41.685 --> 58:43.752
that ever could be
and ever will be.

58:43.754 --> 58:45.687
Need I remind you how
many demons I have slayed?

58:45.689 --> 58:46.622
How many have you slain?

58:46.624 --> 58:47.789
- Ah!

58:47.791 --> 58:51.360
The realm knows no
dirtier soul than yours.

58:52.263 --> 58:53.529
Cleanliness.

58:53.531 --> 58:55.697
Nothing, you are a slob.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.299
- Slander.

58:57.301 --> 59:00.068
Absolute poppycock
and slander, dear sir.

59:00.070 --> 59:01.336
How dare you!

59:01.338 --> 59:05.140
You are weak, and here i
will be standing still,

59:05.142 --> 59:09.444
ready to slay anything that
dares hinder me from my quest.

59:11.281 --> 59:14.449
- Yes.

59:14.451 --> 59:15.517
I see.

59:15.519 --> 59:18.387
I see your judgment is clouded.

59:18.389 --> 59:22.491
My brother, you just
see only what you want.

59:22.493 --> 59:25.894
Clearly, I see it's only
a maiden's fair tale

59:25.896 --> 59:28.630
but quest is in your mind.

59:28.632 --> 59:32.167
Your quest is for
nothing, brother!

59:32.169 --> 59:36.071
Oh, I see you finding
nothing in front of you

59:37.574 --> 59:39.708
but a maiden's backside!

59:58.795 --> 01:00:01.763
- As golden paladins,
as brothers,

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.434
we uphold this realm.

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:09.605
Only the purest and most worthy.

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.573
I take on this burden.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.710
I ask you, sir.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:19.314
How invested are you
in saving our world?

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:24.219
- I need no companions now.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.364
- Where did you get that?

01:00:35.366 --> 01:00:38.467
- Oh, I fetched this
from the valley of mezer.

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:39.434
- Lies.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.438
- Shall I use it
on you, brother?

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:47.943
- No.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:49.945
You won't.

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.687
Would you make sure?

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:04.926
- Wherever did you
get that fine weapon?

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:09.097
- It was given to me by a hand.

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:14.202
From the golden
vincine of calstone.

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:15.604
- What a lie.

01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:19.107
- Here it is before
your very eyes.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:20.676
They lied to you.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.549
- We shall settle
this in the realm.

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:28.684
- Very well.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.320
Bear in mind, comrade,

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:37.159
should our paths cross tonight,

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:37.793
in the realm,

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.665
I will meet you with this.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:49.271
I will catch you
and I will slay you.

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.877
- Fair enough, my brother.

01:01:57.346 --> 01:02:00.649
If your mind is as
slow as your sword,

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:07.522
or your sword as dreadfully
slow as your mind,

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:12.294
I will not haste
to cut you in two.

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:18.633
For I am the chosen knight.

01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:22.938
I am the regal golden paladin
of the vestiges of the realm.

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:30.746
Yes, we will see who we
will see, my brother.

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:42.023
Okay.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.054
- May the kingdom
of the brotherhood

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:15.857
of the golden paladins unite.

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.194
- May the wind of
pan be at your back.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:22.063
- May the soul of
inlay take you.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:37.345
- As I began my spell, i
took the baron's daughter,

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:40.015
tally, and raised her
head for another blast

01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:41.750
of her fiery breath.

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:43.585
Cadmont did not
even glance at her.

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:46.154
Only raised the hand holding
the Violet glowing dust

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.824
of my defensive spell
as if to remind her

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:50.559
that her effort was futile.

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:52.961
Suddenly, one strong
warrior rose forward

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:55.363
and launched his
mass brutal force

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:59.067
directly at the wizard in
a single desperate leap,

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:03.004
lunging, I struck the
outstretched hand.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:06.208
Violet dust was
scattered on the air.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.976
The wizard glared at me in fury,

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:10.111
his expression
flickering through

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:12.314
a gamut of emotions
in a split second,

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:15.450
anger, confusion,
amazement, shock,

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:17.485
as he realized he
had dropped the dust

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:19.855
of his defensive spell.

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:23.658
Fear as he saw the dragon
about to unleash her breath,

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.461
but I was sure that
the last thing I saw

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:27.762
stamped on the wizard's face

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:30.732
an instant before the
fire streamed down

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:34.269
was a look of acceptance
at the wizard's fate.

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:36.137
There was a long
moment of silence,

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:38.673
two burning bodies
lay on the ground.

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:42.310
Cadmont, and that of the
warrior who had dashed forward.

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:45.280
There had not been time to
flee the flames of the blast.

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:48.850
I got to my feet and went over
to the body of the comarade.

01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:51.519
I and the remaining
warriors joined him.

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:53.154
His name is akuli.

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.799
Roll a five or higher
to join alliances

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.869
with cadmont's
army and to proceed

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:10.171
to the next demon citadel.

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.055
- As I pass on
through the forest,

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:29.057
I reach a high bank
formed by a ledge

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.625
of moss-covered rock.

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:33.361
Climbing down the
bank, I notice a cave

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:37.032
with a large Boulder
rolled across the entrance.

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:39.901
The Boulder has
been crudely hewn

01:05:39.903 --> 01:05:41.469
to resemble an angry face

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:46.374
as if warning travelers to
stay away from this spot.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:49.077
I turn, scanning the darkness
for signs of habitation,

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:52.447
a glimmer of light
catches my eyes

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.582
far off between the trees.

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:58.887
Roll a five or higher to
successfully push the Boulder.

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:03.124
If I roll the Boulder
aside to get into the cave,

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:06.261
I advance to the
next demon citadel.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:35.223
- Your
quest is for nothing!

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:12.220
- It is a game.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:13.688
- It's not a game.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.256
- This is a game.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.194
- It is not a game!

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:21.629
- It's a game!

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:24.365
- It's not a game.

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.702
It's not a game!

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:28.970
It's not a game!

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:30.305
It's not a game!

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:31.238
- It's a game!

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:32.607
- It's not a game.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.707
- It is not a game.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.211
- You want to kill your friend.

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:40.515
And it's all because
of some fantasy game.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:41.783
- It's not a game.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:42.716
- It is a game.

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.319
- It's not a game.

01:08:44.321 --> 01:08:47.122
- It is not a game.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.858
It is not a game.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:53.795
It is not a game.

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:58.500
- It is not a game.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:02.804
It is not a game, it is not
a game, it is not a game.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.407
- This is a game!

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.310
Your friends were
playing this game.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.278
- It is not a game.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.212
- But it is a game.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:12.613
It's a game called 13 demons.

01:09:12.616 --> 01:09:14.482
It came out 20 years ago.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.716
- It's not a game.

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:17.618
- Tom Wilkins was also
one of your friends.

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:19.554
He was playing
this game with you.

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.988
- It is not a game.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.625
- You killed 12 people,
including a five year old boy

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:25.059
in the last month.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:28.095
It's all part of
some fantasy game.

01:09:28.098 --> 01:09:32.300
- Oh spare me your
inconsistencies, fool.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.435
I've told you all
that you need to know.

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:37.505
Now, release me from my bonds
or suffer the consequences,

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.808
and all of this will
be on your heads.

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:43.377
This blood.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.612
- It's a game!

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.913
- Fools.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.348
You're all mad.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.050
Release me from my bonds,
bring me my weapon.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:49.884
- No.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:50.984
- Tell me he is close.

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:52.453
I must defeat him.

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:53.654
I must.

01:09:53.657 --> 01:09:56.658
- This is a game,
it's all in your head.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.793
This is all in your
head, none of it is real.

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.895
- No, bring me my weapon,
this has to be done,

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:01.896
this has to be seen through.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:03.364
I must complete my mission.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.833
- You are not on any mission.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.602
- The sake of the
realm is at hand.

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.804
- You're confused, it's a game.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.606
This is only a game.

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.309
- The very essence
of your presence

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:17.212
will be erased from history
unless you release me.

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:20.181
- But this is just
a fantasy game!

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.091
- It's not a game.

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:31.392
- It's just a game.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.260
- It's not a game.

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:33.394
- It is a game.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.362
- It's not a game.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:37.232
- No, this is not a game.

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:38.733
This part isn't a game.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.101
This is a game.

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:41.669
- It's not a game.

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:43.004
- This is game.

01:10:43.006 --> 01:10:44.372
- It is not a game!

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.506
- This is a game!

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:46.541
- This is not a game!

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:49.310
- It's just a fucking game!

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:50.778
- It is not a game!

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.249
- It's a game, look you
fuckwad, this is a game!

01:10:54.251 --> 01:11:00.855
- It's not a game!
