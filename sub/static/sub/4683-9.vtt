WEBVTT

00:20.000 --> 00:22.600
I'll be back. I am free!

00:26.066 --> 00:27.966
No!

01:22.300 --> 01:24.533
So ends another
wasted shift.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.733
Let's eat.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.866
We have three minutes
or we're gonna have to eat

01:26.933 --> 01:27.966
this junk on our own time.

01:28.033 --> 01:29.366
What about the old man?

01:29.433 --> 01:31.233
No sweat, he never shows
at night.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.833
Not since the shooting.

01:32.900 --> 01:35.933
- He's not coming. Trust me.
- How do you know?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.433
He gave me the keys.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.733
Told me to lock up
before midnight.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.866
You know, someday

01:41.933 --> 01:44.500
I'm gonna have
my own private chef

01:44.566 --> 01:48.033
and I am not eating
lousy French fries.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.666
Is that what it's
all about to you, chef?

01:50.733 --> 01:52.900
Yeah, sure.

01:52.966 --> 01:55.300
And yachts, mansions,
stock portfolios.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.800
I'm a guy with easy wants.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.033
A man of the people.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.600
So, uh, what's at the end
of the rainbow for you?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.033
Muscle car.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.166
A what?

02:07.233 --> 02:10.333
Wheels, transportation,
mobility.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.100
Ticket to the human race.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.100
Machine dreams, huh?

02:14.166 --> 02:16.366
You are a total motor-head.

02:16.433 --> 02:17.833
Pick up a PC.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.100
Get yourself
a scholarship, my man.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.100
Oh, yeah, I'm the only
senior in Springwood High

02:21.166 --> 02:23.400
who lost his bicycle
in the senior lot.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.633
First things first.

02:34.566 --> 02:36.100
Hey, beefy boy.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.366
Alex..

02:38.433 --> 02:39.633
'..the usual.'

02:39.700 --> 02:40.700
Sure, John.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.966
Hey, today, okay, hotshot.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.466
Right, John.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.066
Uh, new wheels?

02:50.133 --> 02:52.933
No, just the new paint job.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.033
It's hot.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.466
It's definitely hot.

02:55.533 --> 02:56.933
I know.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.800
Keep the change.

02:58.866 --> 02:59.900
Thanks.

03:06.533 --> 03:07.700
- Hi, Connie.
- Yeah.

03:07.766 --> 03:09.333
More like goodbye.

03:13.966 --> 03:16.566
Looking good, Connie.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.866
Almost good enough
to put on a bun.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.800
Oh-hoo, you're an animal,
Ricky.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.600
Yeah, but I get a good burger.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.366
Congratulate me.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.766
I got into Springwood College,
full scholarship.

03:31.833 --> 03:32.933
Well, I mean,
the letter comes tomorrow

03:33.000 --> 03:34.866
but the welcoming committe
just told me.

03:34.933 --> 03:36.300
I'm on my way.

03:36.366 --> 03:38.333
How about we go somewhere
and celebrate?

03:38.400 --> 03:41.200
Say, uh, the overlook?

03:41.300 --> 03:42.266
Mmm!

03:42.333 --> 03:43.633
My, my.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.000
What you have in mind,
beefy boy?

03:53.866 --> 03:55.300
Alex, what about you?

03:56.866 --> 03:58.300
What about me?

03:58.366 --> 04:01.333
College, you promised we'll be
together this September.

04:04.833 --> 04:06.000
Sure.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.000
Alex, how?

04:08.066 --> 04:09.766
I mean, you didn't apply
to one school.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.933
God, we've been through
all this.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.033
I mean, who am I kidding?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.766
I'm a no Joe College.

04:14.833 --> 04:15.900
I'm no star debater.

04:15.966 --> 04:18.600
I'm no captain
of the football team.

04:18.666 --> 04:19.800
Look, even if I was

04:19.866 --> 04:21.166
I don't, I don't have the grades

04:21.233 --> 04:24.000
to get a scholarship,
right, like you.

04:24.066 --> 04:26.033
And I don't have the money
to pay to go to college.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.366
Look..

04:29.433 --> 04:32.066
you go and, and I'll get a job

04:32.133 --> 04:33.433
at a garage near school

04:33.500 --> 04:35.833
get an apartment, and uh..

04:35.900 --> 04:37.033
we could move in.

04:37.766 --> 04:38.733
That's great.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.266
I can hear my parents now.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.400
Shanked up with
a grease monkey.

04:41.466 --> 04:43.233
I know that's what
they're gonna say to me.

04:44.966 --> 04:46.833
What will you say, Connie?

04:46.900 --> 04:48.633
Oh, Alex, honey, I didn't mean
that the way it sounded.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.100
- Pull over.
- Alex!

04:50.166 --> 04:52.200
- I said pull over.
- Okay, fine.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.400
Alex!

05:07.366 --> 05:09.633
Alex Ross, I don't think
this is very funny!

05:18.900 --> 05:20.200
Alex.

05:28.266 --> 05:29.866
What is it?

05:29.933 --> 05:31.200
Freedom.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.100
Come on.

05:47.966 --> 05:49.300
Hi!

05:49.366 --> 05:51.966
This baby comes
with my guarantee.

05:52.033 --> 05:54.200
One mile or the driver's life

05:54.266 --> 05:56.333
whichever comes first.

06:04.133 --> 06:06.400
Now, what do you want
with this piece of junk?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.833
I'm gonna bring it back, dad.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.000
Yeah, it looks like trouble

06:13.066 --> 06:14.733
and nothing but..

06:20.833 --> 06:22.133
Alex?

06:23.366 --> 06:25.133
- Alex?
- Yeah.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.866
You better get your rear
in gear, son.

06:31.933 --> 06:32.933
What's up, dad?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.066
What's up?

06:34.133 --> 06:35.766
You tell me.

06:35.833 --> 06:37.466
'You know, I've been getting
calls at work on my shift'

06:37.533 --> 06:39.800
'about where you've been
the three last weeks.'

06:39.866 --> 06:42.100
You're sleeping two classes,
you're late for school.

06:42.166 --> 06:43.800
You're working crazy hours
at the burger stand.

06:43.866 --> 06:45.766
Connie gave up on you.

06:45.833 --> 06:47.133
You're going to hell
on a highway

06:47.200 --> 06:48.466
and for what?

06:48.533 --> 06:52.366
Some broken down
blown out rust bucket.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.533
It ends here, mister.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.200
Oh, yeah.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.700
Boy, where is Ward Cleaver
when you need him?

07:23.566 --> 07:24.766
Yo..

07:24.833 --> 07:27.533
My eyes don't tell lies.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.966
Hey, hotshot.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.966
'You bring this rocket back
from the dead or what?'

07:31.033 --> 07:32.433
You could say that.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.100
Oh, zero to sixty
in about ten minutes right

07:36.000 --> 07:37.466
Yeah, we'll see.

07:37.533 --> 07:38.633
Will we?

07:38.700 --> 07:41.366
Anybody see Connie?

07:41.433 --> 07:44.766
Oh, uh, I think she made
other plans.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.100
Why don't you get out
of her life

07:46.166 --> 07:48.933
so she can see
what it's all about.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.533
And what is life
all about, Joe?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.100
If you gotta ask,
you ain't got a clue.

08:20.366 --> 08:25.033
- Oh, check him out!
- Oh, yeah, what a ride!

08:55.666 --> 08:57.300
This car kicks.

09:00.866 --> 09:02.533
Alex, please, slow down!

09:04.100 --> 09:06.366
Aah!

09:06.433 --> 09:08.266
I never made it
out of Springwood

09:08.333 --> 09:09.566
and neither will you.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.333
My eyes deceive me.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.166
You like it?

09:43.233 --> 09:44.533
What's not to like.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.866
Couldn't have said it better.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.333
I can't believe
this is the famous junker

09:47.400 --> 09:49.300
you pulled from
Potter's field.

09:49.366 --> 09:50.433
Yeah, it's come a long way.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
A very long way.

09:51.566 --> 09:53.633
This car has history.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.133
You're gonna tell me
about it?

09:55.200 --> 09:56.666
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you
about it.

09:56.733 --> 10:00.433
The insurance companies
they abandoned it, on purpose.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.400
You've been eating
to many burgers, buddy.

10:03.866 --> 10:05.300
No, I'm serious.

10:05.366 --> 10:07.700
The way the car wound up,
the angle and all

10:07.766 --> 10:08.833
'told the cops how fast'

10:08.900 --> 10:10.933
'the guy was going,
when he died.'

10:11.000 --> 10:13.466
- When who died?
- Eddie Dugan.

10:13.533 --> 10:15.866
The guy who founded
the Springwood Car Club.

10:15.933 --> 10:17.733
The very first ace.

10:19.866 --> 10:22.000
So it's a death car.

10:22.066 --> 10:24.733
Yeah, and Eddie won
the chicken run.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.566
Yeah, well, old Eddie maybe
looking for a comeback.

10:27.633 --> 10:30.100
What are you talkin' about?

10:30.166 --> 10:32.866
I saw something on the road.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.133
At least I thought I did.

10:35.866 --> 10:37.833
Never mind, um,
did you see Connie?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.633
Yeah, she was wondering
where you were.

10:39.700 --> 10:40.866
I think she's hanging out
at the burger stand

10:40.933 --> 10:42.733
with those peppy princesse
she's been seeing.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.233
Hey, beefy boy.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.166
You got any meat
under the hood?

10:55.233 --> 10:57.466
Enough.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.700
Enough to run me?

10:59.433 --> 11:00.833
Run you?

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
One on one.

11:02.566 --> 11:03.866
You and me.

11:03.933 --> 11:07.066
You win, you get to be
one of us.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.200
You get to wear the black ace.

11:09.266 --> 11:11.066
Get respect.

11:11.133 --> 11:12.766
'You mean, I, I'd actually'

11:12.833 --> 11:14.600
get the honor
of being a town bully

11:14.666 --> 11:18.066
with a loud car and a low IQ,
goin' nowhere fast?

11:18.133 --> 11:19.266
You're mine!

11:19.333 --> 11:22.000
You are history around here!

11:22.066 --> 11:23.633
Ooh, I'm shaking.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.500
- Alex
- Who were they?

11:42.566 --> 11:44.700
Just new friends.
Alex, not now.

11:44.766 --> 11:46.733
What, do I have to call
your social secretary?

11:52.133 --> 11:53.666
Everybody is staring at you.

11:53.733 --> 11:55.466
So let 'em!

11:55.533 --> 11:57.466
Alex, please, you're
embarrassing me in front of--

11:57.533 --> 11:59.733
In front of your
snob college friends.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.600
What are you afraid,
I'm gonna blow your cover

12:01.666 --> 12:03.300
in front of your new crowd

12:04.666 --> 12:05.800
Why did you come here?

12:08.766 --> 12:10.400
I came to apologize.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.233
Apologizing isn't necessary

12:14.300 --> 12:15.900
Yes it is.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.100
I was a jerk.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.366
I got so wrapped up

12:19.433 --> 12:21.533
in rebuilding the bomb that I..

12:22.700 --> 12:24.433
Nothing in my life mattered.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.533
I don't blame you
for getting mad.

12:29.133 --> 12:30.233
And I wouldn't blame you

12:30.300 --> 12:32.000
if you never wanted
to see me again.

12:39.033 --> 12:40.466
Your car or mine?

13:04.666 --> 13:06.533
I'm leaving, Connie.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.700
I'm getting out.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.033
We both are.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.433
In September.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.400
I'm not talking college.

13:16.466 --> 13:18.033
I mean away from Springwood.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.133
Away from Springwood?

13:22.200 --> 13:23.333
For good.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.166
I thought you said
you're gonna get a job

13:29.233 --> 13:31.866
at the garage and an apartment
off campus and I can move in.

13:31.933 --> 13:33.400
For what?

13:33.466 --> 13:36.133
So you, so you wind up shacked
up with some grease monkey?

13:37.233 --> 13:40.100
Oh, Alex, come on,
Won't my parents know?

13:40.166 --> 13:41.533
Enough.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.233
Since when?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.233
You're their pride and joy

13:47.300 --> 13:50.566
And they always say they want
what's, what's best for you.

13:50.633 --> 13:53.933
And you always do
what they say anyway.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.466
- That's not true.
- Prove it.

13:56.533 --> 13:58.733
Well, they said
they didn't want us together.

14:00.233 --> 14:01.733
Oh, come on, Alex

14:01.800 --> 14:04.633
can't you just try to enroll,
just give it a chance?

14:04.700 --> 14:07.466
How do you know college
isn't for you until you try?

14:07.533 --> 14:10.133
Forget it. There's nothing left
in Springwood for me.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.266
Oh, thanks a lot.

14:15.866 --> 14:17.333
Except you.

14:19.366 --> 14:21.000
Well, where would you
go anyway?

14:23.133 --> 14:24.233
California.

14:25.466 --> 14:26.900
California?

14:28.700 --> 14:29.833
Come with me.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.600
Alex, I don't know.

14:36.566 --> 14:38.266
Where are you going?

14:38.333 --> 14:39.700
I want to be alone, okay.

14:39.766 --> 14:42.300
I need time to think,
I can walk home from here.

14:47.433 --> 14:49.400
The offer still stands.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.333
There's no way out.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.700
Hi!

16:07.766 --> 16:08.733
Hi!

16:08.800 --> 16:10.900
Where's everybody?

16:10.966 --> 16:12.200
I don't know they left.

16:13.266 --> 16:14.400
What are you
still doing here?

16:16.033 --> 16:18.200
I was worried.

16:18.266 --> 16:19.800
About what?

16:19.900 --> 16:21.400
You.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.700
I waited for you all day
in school today.

16:26.766 --> 16:27.733
And you didn't show up.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.633
And you figured
I already left town.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.800
I was so scared,
I'd never see you again.

16:35.266 --> 16:36.400
Connie..

16:37.400 --> 16:38.833
...come with me.

16:42.633 --> 16:44.100
I'm leaving tonight.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.066
Alex, I don't know.

16:46.133 --> 16:47.733
Well..

16:47.800 --> 16:50.533
I'm gonna home and make
a last minute tune-up.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.033
I'm gonna get
my stuff together.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.800
Meet me
and we're out of here.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.400
Just like that.

16:58.466 --> 17:00.800
Just-just pick up
and leave?

17:00.866 --> 17:03.700
What about obligations,
Alex, responsibilities?

17:03.766 --> 17:05.100
Your parents?

17:05.166 --> 17:08.400
- Forget my parents they--
- Oh, it's the deal.

17:08.466 --> 17:09.700
But what about us?

17:09.766 --> 17:12.700
Huh, tell me about us Connie,
huh? Tell me about us.

17:13.966 --> 17:15.433
It's not that simple.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.700
Isn't it?

17:18.966 --> 17:21.633
Alex this isn't the Wild West.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.033
You know, I mean
there's a more to life

17:23.100 --> 17:25.533
than a-a full tank of gas
and a muscle car.

17:29.566 --> 17:31.733
I wanna be somebody, Alex.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.100
I love you, Connie.

17:50.933 --> 17:52.033
Excuse me?

17:54.566 --> 17:56.033
Move.

17:58.233 --> 18:00.500
So, lover boy loses again, huh?

18:03.600 --> 18:04.733
Get out of my way.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.166
Oh, temper, temper, hotshot.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.200
What's to rush?

18:08.266 --> 18:09.766
- Back off.
- No.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.266
I wanna make it easy
for you motor-head.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.900
Your machine
against my machine.

18:14.966 --> 18:17.800
You and me for Connie.

18:17.866 --> 18:19.766
Now you lose
you leave Connie to me

18:19.833 --> 18:21.366
and get out of town.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.533
If I win?

18:24.233 --> 18:26.900
My machine
for your woman.

18:26.966 --> 18:28.533
It's your loss.

19:49.766 --> 19:50.733
Yeah!

19:55.733 --> 19:58.600
Alex, there's no way out,
kid.

20:08.733 --> 20:11.200
Alex, Alex.

20:14.966 --> 20:16.200
Alex.

20:18.433 --> 20:19.600
Alex!

20:31.300 --> 20:33.233
Oh, my God!

20:33.300 --> 20:34.600
Alex!

20:37.200 --> 20:39.300
Help! Somebody help me!

20:42.000 --> 20:43.933
Alex! Alex!

20:44.000 --> 20:44.966
No!

20:45.033 --> 20:46.300
Alex!

20:46.366 --> 20:48.033
- Alex!
- Alex!

20:48.100 --> 20:49.900
I can't..

20:49.966 --> 20:51.033
Alex!

20:53.766 --> 20:55.433
Alex!

21:36.066 --> 21:39.100
If you're thinking
of leaving Springwood..

21:41.033 --> 21:43.200
...you ain't going nowhere.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.433
You've passed all
the tests of loyalty.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.600
Your ordeal is finally over.

23:24.666 --> 23:27.200
Connie, are you ready
to become one of us?

23:27.266 --> 23:28.333
Yes.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.600
'Do you hereby solemnly swear
in your heart'

23:35.666 --> 23:39.300
a love for all the sworn members
of this sorority?

23:39.366 --> 23:43.133
I swear never to break
your bond with your sisters

23:43.200 --> 23:47.433
or divulge thesecrets
of Omega Kappa Pi.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.033
Yes.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.266
You're one of us now, Connie.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.933
Connie.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.466
I'm Lydia Bennett,
president of Omega Kappa Pi.

24:16.533 --> 24:19.533
- Hi.
- Hi. Have a seat.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.366
So...you'd like to join
our sorority?

24:23.433 --> 24:24.966
- Yes.
- Um-hmm.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.700
Let's see, you attended

24:27.766 --> 24:30.200
Springwood High
Public School?

24:30.266 --> 24:31.966
Yes.

24:32.033 --> 24:34.766
And you're on a full
scholarship here?

24:34.833 --> 24:36.866
- Yes.
- Hm.

24:36.933 --> 24:42.633
Most of the financial aid cases
live in the college dormitories.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.933
Uh, dorms are
a lot more quiet.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.433
And with all the racial
and ethnic diversity..

24:49.500 --> 24:52.266
'...well you might feel
more at home.'

24:52.333 --> 24:54.033
Oh, don't worry about me.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.400
I mean, I'm a native,
born and raised in Springwood.

24:56.466 --> 24:59.733
I'd feel pretty comfortable
anywhere within the city limits.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.500
Um, this doesn't list
your charity involvement.

25:04.566 --> 25:08.100
Well, between school and work
there wasn't a lot of time.

25:08.166 --> 25:11.033
And your last job was at..

25:11.100 --> 25:12.166
...Beefy Boy?

25:13.866 --> 25:17.900
Yes. I worked there
with my boyfriend, Alex.

25:17.966 --> 25:20.433
Oh, well, you and Alex
should get one of those

25:20.500 --> 25:22.733
darling little
off-campus apartments.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.700
Some of them even have
special student rates

25:24.766 --> 25:26.100
and you can split the rent

25:29.733 --> 25:31.533
Alex is dead.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.533
Oh.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.233
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.933
It must be so awful
to be all alone.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.333
Now, do you have any questions
or anything about our sorority?

25:48.700 --> 25:51.733
Well, it's, uh, it's the
oldest one on the campus--

25:51.800 --> 25:53.366
Omega Kappa Pi

25:53.433 --> 25:56.900
was founded over
50 years ago.

25:56.966 --> 26:00.133
Some people think we're like
some old dinosaur.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.933
But it's our traditions
that make Omega house

26:03.000 --> 26:05.666
a kind of sanctuary.

26:05.733 --> 26:09.100
Immune from all
the ugliness out there.

26:09.166 --> 26:12.133
Well, I would-I would really
very much like to join

26:12.200 --> 26:14.566
and I promise
I would do everything

26:14.633 --> 26:17.366
to make the sorority very proud
to have me as a member.

26:17.433 --> 26:20.533
I'm sure you would.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.566
But we have so many requests
and right now we just

26:23.633 --> 26:24.966
don't have any openings.

26:25.033 --> 26:27.200
But thank you
for your interest.

26:27.266 --> 26:29.233
Have a nice day.

26:47.433 --> 26:48.533
Don't worry.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.100
Here at Corpus Rigor Mortis

26:51.166 --> 26:53.666
we're always looking
for new members.

26:55.933 --> 26:57.533
Ulla-bulla.

27:02.233 --> 27:04.833
Been saving this
for a special occasion.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.300
I don't know if it's any good,
but I like the label.

27:07.366 --> 27:08.500
It was on sale.

27:08.566 --> 27:11.433
Oh, I wanna see this.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.300
- Hang on, sure.
- Um-hmm.

27:15.266 --> 27:17.666
A robust fruity wine..

27:17.733 --> 27:20.366
...bottled by the
Pittsburgh Vineyards.

27:20.433 --> 27:24.333
Well...to your first day
at Springwood U.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.433
Good luck.

27:29.166 --> 27:30.733
- Uh.
- Huh.

27:30.800 --> 27:34.666
Well, it's not the wine, it's
the thought that counts, right?

27:34.733 --> 27:37.066
Don't you ever get lonely living
in this house all by yourself?

27:37.133 --> 27:40.600
Oh, after sharing a bathroom
with five brothers and sisters..

27:40.666 --> 27:42.400
Get serious.

27:42.466 --> 27:43.833
True.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.700
But it's really good
to see a familiar face.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.833
You know, um, I thought
you'd be your last quarter

27:48.900 --> 27:51.833
but then when I heard
about Alex's accident

27:51.900 --> 27:54.333
I figured, maybe
you've given up on college.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.566
Well, with Alex gone
there was really no point

27:57.633 --> 27:59.433
in staying there.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.800
Yeah, but that's the past.

28:00.866 --> 28:03.200
This is now. You have
your whole life ahead of you.

28:03.266 --> 28:04.800
You're gonna be meeting
a lots of new people

28:04.866 --> 28:06.000
going a lots of new places.

28:06.066 --> 28:07.700
You know, everybody seems
really nice.

28:07.766 --> 28:09.766
I was over at the Omega Kappa Pi
Sorority house today.

28:09.833 --> 28:11.233
What were you doing there?

28:11.300 --> 28:12.466
Well, I wanted to join

28:12.533 --> 28:13.500
but they said they aren't
accepting any new--

28:13.566 --> 28:16.333
Yeah, not from our side
of tracks anyway.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.533
Come on, Ellen, that stuff
doesn't matter anymore.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.233
Believe me, Connie,
it matters.

28:22.433 --> 28:23.666
As long as you're
in Springwood, you know

28:23.733 --> 28:26.733
that kind of thing
is never gonna change.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.300
You know, you sound
just like Alex.

28:29.366 --> 28:30.666
He figured his whole life
would change

28:30.733 --> 28:32.066
if he could just leave town.

28:32.133 --> 28:34.433
He was just running away,
in that stupid car of his.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.566
Well, I'm not gonna run away.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.500
Springwood's my home.
I don't want help.

28:38.566 --> 28:40.700
I wanna make it,
but I wanna make it here.

28:40.766 --> 28:43.033
And in order to do that
you need friends, Ellen.

28:43.100 --> 28:45.600
New friends,
the right friends.

28:48.733 --> 28:51.600
There is just
a little cash flow problem.

28:51.666 --> 28:53.600
As soon as the checks arrive
from our trust--

28:53.666 --> 28:55.166
Come on, girls.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.466
I'm a graduate at
the Silver Spoon curriculum.

28:57.533 --> 29:00.533
So don't pull that trust fund
stall on me.

29:02.300 --> 29:06.533
The cook...and the housekeeper
have got to go.

29:08.533 --> 29:10.533
You're going to be doing
your own cooking and cleaning

29:10.600 --> 29:12.300
from now on.

29:13.466 --> 29:16.466
Oh, what about the
college alumni loan?

29:16.533 --> 29:18.133
Oh, in order to qualify
you'd have

29:18.200 --> 29:20.100
to base your
membership requirements

29:20.166 --> 29:23.733
on something other than
the Springwoods social register.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.633
That's what I thought.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.266
So what happens now?

29:31.333 --> 29:33.766
That's up to you.

29:33.833 --> 29:37.500
You're going to have to change
if you want to survive.

29:38.833 --> 29:43.166
Omega Kappa Pi Sorority
isn't about change.

29:43.233 --> 29:45.833
It's about tradition.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.233
Well, then...you won't mind

29:48.300 --> 29:51.666
being part of those
other great traditions?

29:51.733 --> 29:54.733
Bankruptcy and eviction.

29:57.933 --> 30:01.266
Oh, my God.
What will people think?

30:01.333 --> 30:04.233
We've got to do something.

30:04.300 --> 30:07.100
I didn't come to college
to learn how to wash dishe

30:07.166 --> 30:09.333
or clean a damn toilet.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.633
And the only person
who ever knew

30:10.700 --> 30:13.466
how to cook in our family
was the cook.

30:13.533 --> 30:15.200
Calm down.

30:15.266 --> 30:18.133
I think I have just
found a solution

30:18.200 --> 30:20.933
'to all our problems.'

30:35.800 --> 30:38.766
We weren't planning on taking
any new members this year

30:38.833 --> 30:41.366
but after the pledge committee
did it's review

30:41.433 --> 30:43.933
and found out all that
you've been through

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
well, the sorority felt
that since your case

30:46.066 --> 30:49.633
is so special that we should
make an exception.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.000
Does this mean
I'm accepted?

30:54.066 --> 30:56.300
Well, there are
a few formalities.

30:56.366 --> 30:57.966
Um, all sorority members must

30:58.033 --> 31:00.233
learn the sorority history
and rules.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.666
And sometime before
the final initiation

31:02.733 --> 31:07.100
you'll need to meet the college
sorority advisor, Ms. Chapin.

31:07.166 --> 31:08.766
Spending one afternoon
with her

31:08.833 --> 31:11.233
can be worse
than all of hell week.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.933
Oh, no. Don't worry.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.566
Nobody's gonna make
you swallow raw liver

31:16.633 --> 31:19.666
or crawl through a swamp
on your hands and knees.

31:19.733 --> 31:21.700
Well, I-I really
wanna thank you.

31:21.766 --> 31:23.500
It's been such a long time
since I felt like

31:23.566 --> 31:24.833
I really belonged anywhere.

31:24.900 --> 31:26.800
Oh. Well, now, run along
and get your things

31:26.866 --> 31:28.133
so we can get you settled in.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.400
Okay.

31:29.466 --> 31:31.233
And, uh, don't forget
your toothbrush.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.266
It's so hard to get into the
corner with a regular mop.

31:49.533 --> 31:50.733
He he he.

31:52.866 --> 31:54.633
Ow!

32:01.600 --> 32:04.366
No time for nap, honey.
Ms. Chapin's on her way.

32:04.433 --> 32:07.300
Now, get upstairs
and get cleaned up. Now!

32:11.600 --> 32:13.033
Boy.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.400
'I'd like to welcome
Ms. Chapin here.'

32:16.466 --> 32:18.266
'We all know how busy she is'

32:18.333 --> 32:19.733
'and we're very grateful
she could make it'

32:19.800 --> 32:22.400
'to this year's
annual pledge luncheon.'

32:22.466 --> 32:24.933
which is even more exclusive
than usual

32:25.000 --> 32:27.200
but for a very special reason.

32:27.266 --> 32:29.666
I'm proud to introduce
our newest member

32:29.733 --> 32:32.666
of Omega Kappa Pi,
Connie Longa.

32:36.333 --> 32:38.433
Connie, I think you're going
to make a wonderful addition

32:38.500 --> 32:40.266
to this sorority.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.700
Your high academic achievements
might even start

32:42.766 --> 32:46.133
a new kind of tradition
at Omega Kappa Pi.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.500
Oh, well, I-I'm just
happy to belong.

32:52.866 --> 32:54.633
Really I think
it makes much more sense

32:54.700 --> 32:57.600
to have a fork on that side.

32:57.666 --> 33:00.133
Most of what we consider
modern manners

33:00.200 --> 33:04.466
are in fact based on some
very old customs.

33:04.533 --> 33:07.300
The guest of honor, me

33:07.366 --> 33:09.400
sitting across from the host

33:09.466 --> 33:13.000
started as a kind
of precautionary measure.

33:13.066 --> 33:14.800
It would be pretty difficult

33:14.866 --> 33:17.733
for a rival to stab..

33:24.000 --> 33:26.033
'...on the side.'

33:31.900 --> 33:34.166
And the host sampling the wine
before serving it

33:34.233 --> 33:36.066
was started by one
of our ancestors

33:36.133 --> 33:39.800
to prove to his guests
that it wasn't poisoned.

33:39.866 --> 33:43.600
And the beverage de jour was
usually served in silver goblets

33:43.666 --> 33:47.100
because it was thought
that the silver can neutralize

33:47.166 --> 33:50.066
any poisons that happened
to slip by.

33:52.200 --> 33:55.500
To Connie, our newest sister.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.633
Well, I better get going
if I want to make

34:23.700 --> 34:26.133
to the alumni loan
committee meeting.

34:28.533 --> 34:31.033
After this lovely luncheon

34:31.100 --> 34:34.500
I think I should amend some
of my recommendations

34:34.566 --> 34:37.900
concerning the Omega Kappa Pi
house application.

34:42.466 --> 34:44.533
Wow. Well, ladies, it looks like

34:44.600 --> 34:47.233
Omega house will survive.

34:47.300 --> 34:50.000
Hey, pledge. Serve us!

34:52.100 --> 34:55.833
Oh, did you think
the initiation was over?

34:55.900 --> 34:57.533
No, Connie.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.433
Hell week has just begun.

35:42.433 --> 35:44.033
Good morning.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.400
I hate cinnamon.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.266
Well, I'm sorry.

35:52.333 --> 35:54.233
I can make you
some new ones tomorrow.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.500
I love these roses
on my bed tray.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.266
In fact,
I'd like roses everyday

36:00.333 --> 36:02.333
but without the thorns.

36:03.666 --> 36:05.066
And when you change the linen

36:05.133 --> 36:07.533
'you could put the rose petals
between my sheets.'

36:07.600 --> 36:11.133
Oh, and don't forget to bake
some cookies for tonight.

36:11.966 --> 36:14.533
My day just isn't complete

36:14.600 --> 36:16.700
unless I have
my milk and cookies.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.400
Diane, you have got
to start exercising.

36:20.466 --> 36:23.766
Iha

36:23.833 --> 36:26.100
Little hard work
never killed anybody.

36:26.166 --> 36:28.300
But why take the chance?

36:37.533 --> 36:40.700
No, I didn't take her necklace,
it's just stolen.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.900
I know it'll turn up somewhere.

36:42.966 --> 36:46.033
That's what we get for letting
her have the run of the place.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.200
I saw we call the police.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.333
The police?

36:51.400 --> 36:53.333
You can't!

36:53.400 --> 36:56.033
I'm sorry, Connie,
but unless you tell me the truth

36:56.100 --> 36:57.833
I'm gonna have to.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.533
Now, if you just admit
you took the necklace

37:00.600 --> 37:02.433
then I promise
we can handle this whole thing

37:02.500 --> 37:04.000
veryd

37:04.066 --> 37:06.200
Make up some excuse
about you not being accepted

37:06.266 --> 37:08.566
into the sorority.

37:08.633 --> 37:10.300
No.

37:10.366 --> 37:11.866
I am not going to do anything

37:11.933 --> 37:14.866
that's going to keep me
out of this sorority.

37:14.933 --> 37:18.033
Better to be out of
Omega House than in jail.

37:19.833 --> 37:21.800
Not to me.

37:25.166 --> 37:27.600
Well, I say
we call the police anyway.

37:27.666 --> 37:28.666
Oh, forget it.

37:28.733 --> 37:29.766
Our only hope was to scare

37:29.833 --> 37:31.333
a confession out of her.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.700
You think Chapin
and the alumni committee

37:32.766 --> 37:34.966
are just going to take
our word for it?

37:35.033 --> 37:37.100
Not to mention the police.

37:37.166 --> 37:40.133
We can't afford the rent
let alone a scandal.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.400
Well what's the use
of saving Omega House

37:42.466 --> 37:45.433
if we have to let in
members like her?

37:45.500 --> 37:48.533
So we get our loan!
We have to callherou

37:49.866 --> 37:52.833
She's not a member yet.

37:52.900 --> 37:57.300
Men have their blood,
sports and wars and women.

37:57.366 --> 38:00.200
Well, we have our own
special rites of passage.

38:01.833 --> 38:03.800
I don't think I can do this.

38:04.466 --> 38:06.700
I know it's hard

38:06.766 --> 38:09.033
but that's why
it will be the ultimate proof

38:09.100 --> 38:12.700
that you're willing to
sacrificeanything

38:13.666 --> 38:16.133
Just one guy, that's all.

38:17.733 --> 38:19.933
Close your eyes
and pretend it's that

38:20.000 --> 38:21.666
boyfriend of yours.

38:23.033 --> 38:25.066
What's his name?

38:25.133 --> 38:26.900
Alex.

38:26.966 --> 38:29.500
The one who died.

38:29.566 --> 38:30.833
Go!

38:40.700 --> 38:42.633
I can't.

38:52.533 --> 38:53.833
Help! Help me!

39:02.466 --> 39:03.733
Umm..

39:17.066 --> 39:19.200
Connie, what are you doing here?

39:19.266 --> 39:22.933
I mean, we didn't exactly
expect to see you again.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.433
Is the initiation over?

39:25.500 --> 39:27.100
It'sallover.

39:28.433 --> 39:29.900
No.

39:29.966 --> 39:32.033
No, it can't be.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.833
I passed
the test of loyalty.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.833
I've earned
the right to belong!

39:38.533 --> 39:41.333
Some people
just can't take a hint.

39:49.866 --> 39:52.233
Damn, this knife is dull.

39:54.166 --> 39:56.300
No...not like that.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.166
You might hurt yourself.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.633
Here..

40:02.700 --> 40:04.033
...let me do it.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.133
Eat it, bitch.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.400
What are you doing here?

40:29.466 --> 40:31.866
Oh, you found your pearls.

40:31.933 --> 40:34.333
See? I told you
they'd turn up somewhere.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.600
Here...let me
help you with them.

40:39.533 --> 40:40.666
Well, okay.

40:40.733 --> 40:41.766
But be careful

40:41.833 --> 40:43.733
they've been in
the family for years.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.400
Oh, don't worry,
I'll be real careful.

40:55.933 --> 40:57.433
'Next time you feel
the munchies'

40:57.500 --> 40:59.400
you really oughta take
a cold shower.

40:59.466 --> 41:01.866
It's a lot less fattening.

41:01.933 --> 41:03.633
Oh, I thought you were Diane.

41:03.700 --> 41:07.233
No, she's downstairs
making a sandwich.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.900
Look, if you're trying to make
me feel guilty by being nice

41:13.966 --> 41:16.000
it just, is not going to work.

41:16.066 --> 41:17.200
There's no way
you're&lt;i

41:17.266 --> 41:19.966
a member of
Omega Kappa Pi sorority.

41:20.033 --> 41:22.066
But you had to know all along

41:22.133 --> 41:25.033
there's no way you could ever
really belong.

41:26.866 --> 41:29.533
Well, at least
you're a good sport.

41:30.933 --> 41:32.400
You need your beauty sleep

41:32.466 --> 41:35.033
so you're fresh
for the initiation ceremony.

42:45.266 --> 42:47.500
You all look so beautiful.

42:50.033 --> 42:52.766
I've passed all
my tests of loyalty.

42:52.833 --> 42:55.033
The ordeal is finally over.

42:57.166 --> 42:59.433
I'm now ready to belong.

43:08.366 --> 43:11.733
I do hereby solemnly swear

43:11.800 --> 43:14.900
a love to all the sworn members
of the sorority

43:14.966 --> 43:17.633
'and swear never
to break the bond'

43:17.700 --> 43:20.533
of my sorority sisters..

43:20.600 --> 43:23.066
...or divulge the secrets..

43:23.133 --> 43:25.100
...of Omega Kappa Pi.

43:26.433 --> 43:28.900
I do hereby solemnly swear

43:28.966 --> 43:32.433
'a love to all the sworn members
of the sorority..'

43:33.866 --> 43:38.366
...and swear never to break
the bond of my sisters..

43:38.433 --> 43:41.933
...or divulge the secrets
of Omega Kappa Pi.

43:49.466 --> 43:51.700
- 'Pick 'em up.'
- 'Yeah.'

43:56.600 --> 43:57.700
It was the wiring.

43:57.766 --> 43:59.533
Whole place went up
like a pile of timber.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.600
Should have been
torn down years ago.

44:01.666 --> 44:04.066
I was just on my way over
to meet one of the new members

44:04.133 --> 44:05.333
when I heard the sirens.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.533
Well, she went through
one hell of an initiation.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.400
Get the paramedics. We've found
a survivor in the kitchen.

44:15.133 --> 44:16.666
...members of the sorority..

44:16.733 --> 44:19.100
Sssh. Sssh. Sssh.

44:19.166 --> 44:21.333
Don't try to talk.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.833
You're safe now,
that is all that matters.

44:23.900 --> 44:25.900
I did it.

44:25.966 --> 44:27.800
I did it.
I'm one of them.

44:27.900 --> 44:29.766
No..

44:29.833 --> 44:33.333
No, you're not one of them,
thank God, you're alive.

44:34.733 --> 44:36.433
I'm not one of them?

44:46.100 --> 44:49.433
Ah...the old college try.

44:51.066 --> 44:53.033
If you can't join 'em..

44:57.866 --> 44:59.400
...roast 'em!
