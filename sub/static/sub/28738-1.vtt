The Handmaid's Tale...

00:07.758 --> 00:08.839
Hello there.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.009
Did you try to find me?
I waited for you.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.758
I know. And I'm so sorry
I couldn't be there for you.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.548
- Hannah.
- Her name is Agnes now.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.134
It's okay.
I have new parents, now.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.471
Hey, Waterford! Waterford,
you fucking piece of shit!

00:22.564 --> 00:24.647
- And, you are?
- Luke Bankole.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.711
You're gonna remember my face
'cause I'm gonna remember yours.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.271
He's a serial rapist!

00:28.362 --> 00:29.714
You're not gonna do
anything about it.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.229
<i>There's protests planned.
I encourage you to speak out.</i>

00:33.158 --> 00:35.741
Not Ruby, asshole.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.906
<i>She has no contact
with the baby.</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:42.535
And she pumps in her room.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.834
You cannot give up.
You're gonna see your son again.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.082
- I'm not his mother anymore.
- Of course, you are.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.040
<i>At least your son is in Canada.
He's free! With your wife!</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:54.298
Commander Lawrence is
a very brilliant, very important man.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.971
<i>He is considered the architect
of Gilead's economy.</i>

00:57.349 --> 01:00.012
I'm wondering why such
an important, brilliant man

01:00.102 --> 01:01.934
would take in such
a shitty Handmaid.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.727
He did something terrible.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.898
The Colonies! He came up
with the whole thing.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.268
You are such
a fucking idiot.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.604
When did you become
such a bitch?

01:12.698 --> 01:16.988
It is our duty to ensure that the children
of Gilead live by the laws of Scripture.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.694
<i>That our sons and daughters
should be taught to read it.</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:22.113
Fred! Stop! Stop it!

01:22.207 --> 01:24.119
I tried.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.252
We value privacy in this house.
Do you understand?

01:28.338 --> 01:30.876
God has called me
to a higher purpose.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.922
You don't believe that?

01:36.096 --> 01:39.009
I will not let you grow up
in this place.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.842
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.678
We can get you out. You and the baby,
but you have to go right now!

01:44.771 --> 01:46.103
- Who's "we"?
- Friends.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.055
Marthas. Go! Go!

01:50.861 --> 01:52.443
My child is missing!

01:53.071 --> 01:54.799
It's too dangerous out there.
We'll stay here.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.407
Listen to me.
She cannot grow up here.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.785
Holly, this is
your sister.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.037
You're gonna meet
her one day.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.789
- Emily?
- What is happening?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.917
I'm getting myself
in deep shit.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.377
- You're getting out of Gilead.
- Don't get caught!

02:18.055 --> 02:19.387
Call her Nichole.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.257
June!

02:25.270 --> 02:27.853
- Please don't take her! No!
- Mommy!

02:27.939 --> 02:29.851
<i>Mommy!</i>

02:31.068 --> 02:32.104
<i>Mommy?</i>

watch over her.</i>

03:04.476 --> 03:05.637
<i>Protect her.</i>

03:05.977 --> 03:09.266
<i>Because this isn't the place
with the still waters and green pastures,</i>

03:09.940 --> 03:11.602
<i>if you haven't noticed.</i>

03:11.692 --> 03:13.274
<i>This is the valley of death.</i>

03:14.778 --> 03:17.236
<i>And there's a fuck-ton
of evil to fear.</i>

03:17.989 --> 03:21.699
<i>Please. Get her
the hell out of here.</i>

03:29.418 --> 03:34.209
<i>If she gets out, will she remember me?
Will she know that I gave her away?</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:37.673
<i>I have reasons.</i>

03:38.468 --> 03:41.506
<i>There are always reasons.</i>

03:41.596 --> 03:43.713
<i>I'm sorry, baby girl.</i>

03:43.807 --> 03:45.389
<i>Mom's got work.</i>

03:58.655 --> 04:01.363
Fuck! Shit.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.373
Are you insane?

04:54.252 --> 04:57.086
You didn't get in the truck.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.925
Thoughts?

05:07.599 --> 05:09.465
You know what,
get in the car.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.848
We can catch 'em before they cross
the border. Come on.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.555
Do you know
Commander Mackenzie?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.102
He has a daughter.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.154
Her name is Agnes.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.868
I need you to take me there,
and then we can head north.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.244
A daughter?

05:36.086 --> 05:39.079
I can't leave without her.

05:40.757 --> 05:41.998
You can.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.260
I won't.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.598
You helped Emily.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.812
I liked Emily.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.283
They could put you
on the wall.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.866
Even a Commander.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.293
Spunky.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.057
I'll take you to Mackenzie.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.537
Mrs. Waterford?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.627
Serena, Praise be.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.882
Everyone has lost their minds.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.965
Go to my office. Call 911.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.635
Let her pass, son.
This has gone far enough.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.937
We should
give her more time...

08:03.775 --> 08:05.141
To get away.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.531
What did you do?

08:14.411 --> 08:17.745
I did what was best
for my child.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.214
Praise be.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.371
Oh, my God.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.871
- Where is she?
- Upstairs in her bed.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.293
And the Mackenzies?

10:29.379 --> 10:31.419
The Commander's away for work.
Mistress is sleeping.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.585
She goes up early.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.712
Please! Be careful.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.205
<i>All units report
to stations at the perimeter.</i>

11:13.882 --> 11:14.963
<i>Copy.</i>

12:06.226 --> 12:08.889
Baby, I'm here.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.646
I am not ever
going to leave you.

12:12.982 --> 12:17.397
And I love you.
I love you so much.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.862
I am always here.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.153
I love you.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.951
<i>Moving in. Moving in.</i>

13:13.793 --> 13:15.000
Don't scare her.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.017
Jonathan.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.589
- Ma'am.
- Bring her inside, please?

13:40.653 --> 13:41.734
Yes, Ma'am.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.546
Is she okay,
Mrs. Mackenzie?

14:03.885 --> 14:05.485
She slept through it all.

14:05.887 --> 14:09.130
- Praise be.
- Praise be.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.222
- MRS.
- Please.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.938
This has to stop.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.187
You brought our child
into the world.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.940
The Commander and I bless you
for that, God knows.

14:26.783 --> 14:30.242
She had nightmares for weeks
after the summer house.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.284
Of course, she told me.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.123
I'm her mother.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.959
You're being cruel.
Confusing her like this.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.182
I'm confusing her?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.310
Take her home.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.938
What's she like?

15:10.201 --> 15:11.408
She's very happy.

15:12.829 --> 15:17.119
She's a healthy,
blessed child.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.415
She's thriving.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.745
Jonathan.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.925
She's fine.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.727
She's amazing.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.561
She likes to sew,

15:49.657 --> 15:50.898
but she's not
very good at it.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.071
Bless her efforts.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.619
She's actually
quite a good cook.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.417
Luke cooks.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.996
Her father.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.165
He's good at it, too.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.843
- She wants a dog.
- Oh.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.139
She's allergic.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.849
She says she'll get the shots.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.521
- She won't stick to it.
- No.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.936
She hates shots.

16:30.031 --> 16:33.524
Yeah.
Maybe, a Goldendoodle. I don't know.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.154
Something hypoallergenic.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.451
Yeah.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.626
The Commander doesn't love the idea,
but she's working on him.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.663
She's very good at that.

16:47.757 --> 16:48.757
Yeah.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.308
I appreciate the home
you've made for her.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.146
Thank you.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.118
Please, stop.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.123
You know all of this ends with you dying
on the ground in front of her.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.590
If you love her,

17:33.636 --> 17:34.717
you have to stop.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.599
Praise be.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.185
She has your eyes.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.897
It truly is a miracle.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.408
I'm her mother.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.730
Leave us, Nick.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.740
Where is she?

19:25.790 --> 19:28.954
Do me the courtesy of looking
at me when I'm talking to you!

19:29.085 --> 19:33.204
Where is she? You've killed
us all, you realize.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.502
When they find out what happened here,
we'll all be on the wall!

19:36.634 --> 19:38.751
And they will tear you apart!

19:40.096 --> 19:42.008
She's safe, Serena.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.968
Serena, I promise you,
she is safe.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.929
I'll know she's safe
when you tell me where she is.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.472
Where is she?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.601
I'm trying
to save your life.

19:55.778 --> 19:59.021
Did you give her
to Ofjoseph?

20:01.450 --> 20:04.409
I did what was best
for her, Serena.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.123
Did you give my baby
to Ofjoseph?

20:10.209 --> 20:13.313
You wanted a better life for her,
and that is what a mother does for her child.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.669
You gave her to a murderer!

20:15.673 --> 20:19.007
You killed my baby!
You've killed my baby!

20:19.093 --> 20:20.959
How could you take her
away from me?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.760
'Cause I have
another daughter!

20:22.847 --> 20:25.635
You chased us in the woods,
and you hunted us down with dogs.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.468
And when you pulled her away,
she screamed!

20:28.561 --> 20:31.599
My baby screamed
for her mother!

20:31.689 --> 20:34.022
And I hope this
feels like that!

20:51.083 --> 20:54.292
It's okay.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.225
Serena,

21:13.022 --> 21:14.308
listen to me.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.145
She's going to be okay.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.735
She's going to be free.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.657
It was so cold outside.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.654
You left her in the cold.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.865
You were supposed
to protect her.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.245
I know.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.629
God will protect her.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.883
Have faith.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.894
Nick.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.190
Take her to her room.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.180
What's wrong with you?

22:36.856 --> 22:39.617
Do you know how many people risked
their lives tonight to get you out?

22:42.736 --> 22:43.897
Jesus, June.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.240
You're so fucking selfish!

22:53.998 --> 22:56.490
There won't be another chance,
do you know that?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.625
You're never getting out.
You're gonna fucking die here.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.923
I know that.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.470
Don't you think
I fucking know that?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.195
Come on, Nichole.

26:16.950 --> 26:20.159
No. No. Come on.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.706
Nichole?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.437
Oh!

27:01.453 --> 27:04.662
Oh, Jesus. You guys okay?

27:04.748 --> 27:08.162
- Don't! No! No!
- No. No, no. It's all right. It's okay.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.590
Ma'am. If you return
to your home country,

27:15.676 --> 27:17.884
would you be persecuted
based on being a woman,

27:17.970 --> 27:20.810
and would you be subject to the danger
of torture, or risk to your life?

27:20.889 --> 27:22.755
As a person
in need of protection,

27:22.850 --> 27:26.389
do you wish to seek asylum
in the country of Canada?

27:30.774 --> 27:34.267
- Yes. We do.
- All right.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.818
This is SQA13.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.068
I need an ambulance with
pediatric at my location.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.146
Are you okay?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.069
I need to keep it clean.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.237
It'll heal quickly,
I'm sure.

28:29.958 --> 28:33.247
I'm heading to the office.
Will you be all right?

28:35.923 --> 28:37.164
Yes.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.503
They've put Hansen in charge
of Nichole's kidnapping.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.301
You'll tell him
what happened.

28:49.394 --> 28:53.604
Ofjoseph attacked Aunt Lydia,
and took Nichole and ran.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.524
You and Offred tried to stop her,
as any mother would.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.611
It's the only way
to keep you off the wall.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.574
You don't need
to protect me.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.335
I am protecting this house.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.553
God has made me master
of an incredible woman.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.351
I sent her away, Fred.
It was my choice.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.558
I drove you to desperation.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.350
I'll fix this.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.522
Things will be normal
again, Serena.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.322
Back to the way they were.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.077
I promise.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.259
Serena.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.364
Serena.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.256
Serena.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.011
Come on.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.378
- What happened?
- Get out. Go.

36:21.971 --> 36:27.091
<i>Lord Jesus, be revealed from heaven
with His mighty angels.</i>

36:27.185 --> 36:31.930
<i>In flaming fire,
Thou shall take vengeance.</i>

36:32.023 --> 36:35.232
<i>Burn, motherfucker, burn.</i>

38:58.211 --> 38:59.952
Hi, I'm Dr. Chung.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.959
You're safe now, and we're
very glad you're here.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.667
We can only imagine
what you've been through.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.465
So, the first thing
we're going to do is

39:08.555 --> 39:10.715
we're gonna make sure that
the both of you are healthy.

39:11.099 --> 39:15.218
I'd rather hang onto her.
If that's all right.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.552
Of course, it is.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.266
This way.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.623
Miss.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.693
Hey.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.274
Take care.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.703
You, too.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.954
Nick.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.565
<i>Redeploy your men.</i>

42:01.853 --> 42:06.769
The Mackenzies may forgive you,
but God requires penance.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.690
Let's go.

43:10.171 --> 43:11.503
Sorry, dude.

43:19.222 --> 43:21.214
- Hey.
- You know what this is?

43:21.307 --> 43:22.514
We'll find out.

43:35.488 --> 43:37.070
- You're next.
- Yes, that's me.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.738
- What am I doing for you?
- Hey. Sorry.

43:38.825 --> 43:41.693
- Do you have ID?
- Bankole. B-A-N-K-O-L-E.

43:41.786 --> 43:44.494
Can you just give me
a minute? Sorry.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.116
Here you go.

43:46.207 --> 43:49.416
I do refugee intake
at the office on Dundas.

43:49.502 --> 43:52.461
- We're getting slammed over there, too.
- Everyone loves Canada.

43:53.965 --> 43:54.965
Thanks.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.668
Okay. Got it.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.322
- Can you sign for that, please?
- Yeah.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.678
- There you go.
- Great.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.304
Thanks.

44:07.395 --> 44:10.888
Jackson? Okay. Yup.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.439
Oh, my God.

44:21.534 --> 44:22.866
She's so big.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.324
She's so big.

44:35.464 --> 44:36.500
She's...

44:39.927 --> 44:43.170
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:43.264 --> 44:46.598
- Are you Luke?
- Yeah.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.728
I'm Emily.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.640
Your wife saved my life.

45:12.043 --> 45:14.205
Let's go.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.622
Eyes down.

45:23.679 --> 45:25.011
Blessed be the fruit.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.297
May the Lord open.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.679
They're safe.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.887
Emily and the baby.
They made it.

45:38.361 --> 45:39.361
Under His eye.

46:44.927 --> 46:48.170
You. Get your case
and come with me.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.175
You've got a new posting.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.097
Blessed be the fruit.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.522
May the Lord open.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.256
You're not gonna be
any trouble, are you?

48:19.313 --> 48:21.145
No, sir.
