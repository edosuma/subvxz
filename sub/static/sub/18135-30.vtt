00:26.460 --> 00:29.394
Yeah, just making sure
everyone's behaving
themselves.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.430
It's dead silent around here.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.999
Hey, look!

00:34.034 --> 00:36.435
It's the fastest man alive!

00:36.470 --> 00:39.871
And his pal The Flash.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.909
How?

00:43.944 --> 00:45.243
Lock down, now!

No one gets in or out
until I find him.

LEX: You don't have
to keep pointing

00:49.950 --> 00:51.283
that weapon at me, Karen.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.552
The warden says I do,
Mr. Luthor.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.720
Building a bomb
of ultimate destruction

00:55.755 --> 00:59.291
isn't the same as using a bomb
of ultimate destruction.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.159
You know, it's more
of a hobby really.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.395
Hands where I can see them,
Mr. Luthor.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.964

Joker.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.540
How random?

01:15.575 --> 01:16.575
Kiss me!

01:18.011 --> 01:19.377
No.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.545

01:20.580 --> 01:22.080
Same old Lex!

01:22.115 --> 01:23.782
Come on, let's get going.

01:24.818 --> 01:25.851
Uh...

01:25.886 --> 01:27.219
Prison?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.655
Oh. Right.

01:30.957 --> 01:32.958
A Mother Box! Where did you...

01:32.993 --> 01:36.628
A little present
from my dear old friend,
Desaad.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.631
What those new gods will
think of next?

01:39.666 --> 01:40.465
Stop!

01:40.500 --> 01:42.734
<i>Sayonara,</i> slowpoke!

01:46.706 --> 01:47.672
Uh...

01:47.707 --> 01:50.642
Your gadget seems
a little off.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.478
It may not be one of the big
boom tube models

01:53.513 --> 01:56.515
but it gets a fellow
where he wants to go.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.316
When I heard you'd been
locked up

01:58.351 --> 02:00.352
for some trivial infraction...

02:00.387 --> 02:02.687
Creating the bomb of
ultimate destruction.

02:02.722 --> 02:03.889
Bingo!

02:03.924 --> 02:06.358
I decided I must break you out
and treat you

02:06.393 --> 02:09.427
to the best day ever!

02:09.462 --> 02:13.231
Why? We've only been tenuous
allies before, at best.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.868
What do you really
want, Joker?

02:16.736 --> 02:17.836
Want?

02:17.871 --> 02:19.871
Me? What?

02:19.906 --> 02:23.441
No, no, no, I like you, Lex.
Honest.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.178
And sometimes
I worry you're not happy.

02:26.213 --> 02:29.381
And I worry you're completely
off your meds. Goodbye.

02:29.416 --> 02:32.017
Now, I've made a list
of fun things to do.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.418
First, the beach.

02:33.453 --> 02:36.621
Look, it's almost paradise.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.025
Oh, Lex, I wouldn't go there.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.294
Stay where you are. Luthor?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.529
Great Hera, Joker too?

02:50.270 --> 02:52.804
I'm obeying the rules, WW.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.374
No boy footsies
on the island. (CHUCKLES)

02:56.409 --> 02:59.278
Lex, I warned you.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.415
You're both under arrest.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.550
That's Princess Killjoy
for you.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.886
We'll take our fun elsewhere.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.422

(GRUNTS)

03:16.196 --> 03:17.929
Joker, where are we?

03:17.964 --> 03:22.033
Quick, what are
the two sweetest words
in English language?

03:22.068 --> 03:23.668
Destroy Superman.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.670
Well yes, they are on
the list.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.573
But actually,
I was thinking...

03:28.608 --> 03:30.942
Log flume!

03:30.977 --> 03:31.977
(JOKER LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

03:34.581 --> 03:36.081
SUPERMAN: Yeah,
it's them, all right.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.483
The weird part is, they're not
doing anything wrong.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.352
They just seem to be
hanging out.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.288
First, Joker broke Luthor
out of prison.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.856
That's as wrong as it gets.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.860
Second, they're criminals,
they don't hang out.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.562
Well, we're hanging out.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.098
We're working.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.401
We could hang out sometime,
we talked about going bowling.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.437
To Batman's point,
Joker's antics are never

03:59.472 --> 04:00.872
as innocent as they seem.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.208
So, Joker wants something
and Luthor's got it.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.509
But what?

04:04.544 --> 04:06.611
Right now, we're as clueless
as Luthor.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.214
Though I'm pretty sure
of where they're headed next.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.882

04:10.917 --> 04:12.484
FLASH: North Pole?

04:12.986 --> 04:13.986
Oh, no.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.322
Now, that's just wrong.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.058
Looks like they were
chased off.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.694

04:31.738 --> 04:33.805
Good boy.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.107
Should we be worried about
what might be happening

04:36.142 --> 04:37.375
in the watch tower now?

04:37.410 --> 04:39.478
I left a precaution of my own.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.552
Well done.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.390
You guys and your dogs.

04:52.425 --> 04:53.725
It's kind of adorable.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.560
I've alerted
the entire league.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.862
No matter where Luthor
and Joker appear.

close by.
