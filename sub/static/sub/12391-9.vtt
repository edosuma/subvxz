LET'S HIT IT.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.653
SORRY, DAD, WE WERE JUST
CHECKING OUT THAT SUPERCOP.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.658
SHAWN, THAT IS NOT
A SUPERCOP.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.429
THAT GUY

00:37.470 --> 00:39.097
WHAT'S THAT, A COP

00:39.140 --> 00:41.290

00:54.150 --> 00:56.414
IF YOU WANT
TO ARREST SOMEBODY,

00:56.450 --> 00:58.145
YOU DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.

00:58.190 --> 00:59.384

01:06.200 --> 01:07.792
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK
AT THIS PICTURE.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.795
JUST DID 36 MONTHS

01:14.840 --> 01:16.137
BUT HE'S UPPED
HIS GAME RECENTLY

01:16.170 --> 01:17.307

01:32.890 --> 01:34.482
WHAT, ARE YOU WRITING
A MOVIE SCRIPT ABOUT THIS?

01:34.520 --> 01:35.748
WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS
ON THE FACTS

01:35.790 --> 01:37.326
I'M GIVING YOU
INSTEAD OF COMPILING YOUR OWN?

01:37.360 --> 01:39.499
YOU KNOW WHAT, DETECTIVE?
I GOT THIS.

01:39.530 --> 01:42.169
IT WAS MY FAULT.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.168
TANCANA WAS
IN MY CUSTODY AT THE TIME.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.430
I WAS ESCORTING HIM
FROM HOLDING

01:46.470 --> 01:47.562
TO THE COURTHOUSE.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.160

LOOK, MR. COLE, I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU MUST FEEL.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.928
BUT YOU SHOULD TAKE COMFORT
IN KNOWING

02:45.960 --> 02:47.120
THAT MYSELF,
DETECTIVE LASSITER,

02:47.160 --> 02:49.526

ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN

02:49.570 --> 02:51.265
TO BRING TANCANA
BACK INTO CUSTODY.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.939
OH, I THINK YOU'VE
ALREADY DONE YOUR PART.

02:53.970 --> 02:55.232
AND THAT WAS ALLOWING
MY WIFE'S KILLER

02:55.270 --> 02:56.339
TO ESCAPE.

02:56.370 --> 02:57.359
NOW, MAYBE YOU CAN
JUST STEP ASIDE

02:57.410 --> 03:00.208
AND LET MR. TATUMS
DO WHAT HE DOES.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.549
ALL DO RESPECT, SIR,
WHAT WE DID

03:02.580 --> 03:03.899
WAS APPREHEND THE MAN,
ARREST HIM,

03:17.330 --> 03:18.888

WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

03:18.930 --> 03:19.726

GO TO THE AIRPORT

AND BRIEF SECURITY
ON TANCANA'S STATS.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.589

ARE YOU PUNISHING ME?

03:33.980 --> 03:35.231
NO!

YES, EVERY BIT.

03:55.330 --> 03:55.955
NO.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.695
NO WAY, O'HARA.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.493
I AM NOT GONNA DO THAT.
WE DON'T NEED THEM ON THIS.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.337
SHOULD I DIAL THE NUMBER
OR DO YOU WANT TO?

04:03.340 --> 04:04.637
WHAT DID YOU DO?
YOU SAID TO CALL.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.308

WHETHER OR NOT TO CALL.

07:37.950 --> 07:39.986
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
GO TO THE COSTUME SHOP

07:40.020 --> 07:42.784
AND GET A BOUNTY HUNTER'S
WRIST BRACELET

07:42.830 --> 07:43.785
AND ACCESSORIES KIT,

07:43.830 --> 07:44.979
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE WON'T

07:45.030 --> 07:47.555
BE BRINGING IT
IN A BIG WAY.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.919
WELL, GO AHEAD AND BRING IT.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.769
BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.
PEOPLE GET HURT.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.097
OH, AND BY THE WAY...

07:52.130 --> 07:54.098
THESE DON'T COME IN "TINY."

07:55.300 --> 07:58.064
WE'LL JUST GET
A WOMEN'S LARGE.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.065
WOW.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.078
I THINK I HATE THAT GUY.

08:01.110 --> 08:02.975
YEAH, THAT'S THE WAY
IT USUALLY GOES

08:03.010 --> 08:03.874
WHEN YOU MEET
YOUR CHILDHOOD HEROES, GUS.

08:03.910 --> 08:06.174
NOTHING BUT HEARTACHE
AND DISAPPOINTMENT.

08:06.210 --> 08:08.747
REMEMBER HOW SAD YOU WERE
WHEN YOU RAN INTO JUDGE REINHOLD

08:08.780 --> 08:09.940
AT THE DRY CLEANERS?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.241
SHAWN, WE NEED
TO GET ON THIS RIGHT AWAY.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.780
YEAH, FOR JULIET.

08:12.820 --> 08:15.050
SHE'S HAD OUR BACKS,
NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE HER BACK.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.555
JULES, YOU OKAY?

08:20.600 --> 08:23.091
FINE.
26 SECONDS.

08:23.130 --> 08:24.688
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:24.730 --> 08:26.834
OH, I'M DISASSEMBLING
MY SIDE ARM

08:26.870 --> 08:27.996
AND THEN ASSEMBLING
IT AGAIN.

08:28.040 --> 08:28.836
I TIME MYSELF.

08:28.870 --> 08:31.134
IT'S AN OLD ACADEMY
STRESS EXERCISE.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.832
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.906
(Juliet)
OH, IT'S A VIDEO
THAT A BYSTAN DER TOOK

08:36.950 --> 08:38.201
WITH HIS CELL PHONE
OF TANCANA

08:38.250 --> 08:39.615
ESCAPING FROM
THE COURTHOUSE.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.711
IS HE DIABETIC OR DOES
HE HAVE A HEART CONDITION?

08:44.750 --> 08:46.115
YEAH,
HE HAS A HEART CONDITION.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.219
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

08:47.260 --> 08:50.058
OH, IT CAME TO ME.
PSYCHICALLY.

08:50.090 --> 08:51.626
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY

08:51.660 --> 08:53.150
FOR THE WHOLE
"HAND TO HEAD" THING.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.156
I'M LEANING IN
QUITE NICELY HERE.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.067
DID TANCANA HAVE ANY FAMILY
IN TOWN THAT WE KNOW OF?

08:58.100 --> 09:00.864
YES, HE HAS A COUSIN
WHO'S A SHORT ORDER COOK

09:00.900 --> 09:01.969
AT MARVIN'S OFF LA CUMBRE.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.103
BUT HELLO,
DON'T YOU THINK

09:03.140 --> 09:04.334
THAT'S THE FIRST PLACE
WE CHECKED?

09:04.370 --> 09:06.804
YEAH, HELLO, GUS.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.807
LOOK, WE GO'I'I'A GO.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.807
BUT YOU HAVE MY WORD,

09:08.840 --> 09:09.841
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS RIGHT.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.114
I ALREADY TOLD
THE BLONDE DETECTIVE THERE,

09:16.150 --> 09:18.983
I HAVEN'T EVEN SPOKEN
TO MY COUSIN IN MONTHS.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.317
I THOUGHT HE WAS IN PRISON.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.351
HE WAS.
UNTIL THIS MORNING.

09:22.390 --> 09:23.152
WHEN HE JUMPED
HIS ARRAIGNMENT

09:23.190 --> 09:24.589
AND ESCAPED
FROM THE COURTHOUSE.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.619
HE'S ON THE RUN.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.855
WELL, THAT'S AWFUL.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.197
I'M IN SHOCK.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.697
YEAH, YOU LOOK LIKE IT.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.869
YEAH, SO MUCH SO
YOU'RE JUST GONNA

09:32.900 --> 09:34.788
DRINK SOME COFFEE,
KEEP COOKING.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.330
HELPS ME COPE.

09:45.350 --> 09:46.749
DUDE, TANCANA'S HERE.

09:46.780 --> 09:47.917
WHAT?

09:47.950 --> 09:50.145
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE'S HERE?

09:50.190 --> 09:51.885
LOOK AT THOSE TWO TRUCKERS.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.217
THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT ORDERED THE BURGERS.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.012
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE GRAPPLING
OVER THE KETCHUP.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.823
AND LOOK AT THAT DUDE
IN THE CORNER.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.725
WAITRESS ALREADY DROPPED OFF
THE RUSSIAN DRESSING.

09:58.760 --> 10:03.322
WHICH MEANS HE IS WAITING
ON THE REUBEN.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.089
BUT LOOK WHAT HE'S MAKING
IN THE CORNER THERE.

10:06.130 --> 10:08.064
EGG WHITES.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.239
THAT'S NOT ON THE MENU
AT A GREASY SPOON LIKE THIS,

10:10.270 --> 10:11.009
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.302
BUT IT'S JUST
WHAT A HEART PATIENT

10:12.340 --> 10:14.035
WOULD EAT TO STAY HEALTHY.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.840
LET'S GET HIM!

10:19.880 --> 10:21.279
NO, UH-UH, SHAWN.
NO.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.051
WE'RE BOUNTY HUNTERS.
THAT'S WHAT BOUNTY HUNTERS DO.

10:27.090 --> 10:28.216
WE ARE NOT BOUNTY HUNTERS,
SHAWN.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.318
I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL SALESMAN.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.827
AND LASSITER
MADE IT VERY CLEAR.

10:30.860 --> 10:32.122
HE SAID,
"IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS."

10:32.160 --> 10:34.025
THESE ARE CERTAIN TERMS, SHAWN.
CERTAIN TERMS.

10:34.060 --> 10:34.822
SOMEBODY FORGOT TO DRINK

10:34.860 --> 10:36.054
THEIR COURAGEOUS JUICE
THIS MORNING.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.625
FINE.
GET IN THE CAR.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.998
DWAYNE!
TAKE OFF NOW!

10:45.040 --> 10:48.703
[dishes crashing]

10:50.310 --> 10:51.743
AAH!

10:51.780 --> 10:55.409
[both grunting]

10:55.450 --> 10:57.839
ENJOYING THAT HAMBURGER,
HUH?

10:58.890 --> 11:01.916
[dishes shattering]

11:01.960 --> 11:03.257
WHOA!
WOW.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.258
[groaning]

11:14.070 --> 11:15.332
WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.462
WAIT, LET'S STOP
AND THINK ABOUT THIS

11:16.500 --> 11:17.933
FOR A SECOND.

11:17.970 --> 11:18.937
I DON'T NEED TO THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING, SHAWN!

11:18.970 --> 11:19.777
I WANNA GET OUT OF HERE!

11:19.810 --> 11:21.277
BUT GUS, WE WERE THERE!
WE SAW HIM!

11:21.310 --> 11:22.777
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
TELL JULES?

11:22.810 --> 11:24.346
TELL HER
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.109
UH, I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE HERE.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.811
WE NEED TO GO.

11:27.850 --> 11:28.612
[engine turns over]

11:28.650 --> 11:29.810
DRIVE! DRIVE DRIVE
DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE!

11:29.850 --> 11:30.839
[yelling]

11:30.890 --> 11:33.757
[tires screeching]

11:38.460 --> 11:39.825
YOU GUYS ARE TOAST!

11:39.860 --> 11:41.088
YOU HEAR ME?

11:41.130 --> 11:42.154
YOU'RE TOAST!

11:42.200 --> 11:46.125
DUDE, WE'RE, LIKE,
THE BEST BOUNTY HUNTERS EVER.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.159
THE CRIMINALS COME STRAIGHT
INTO OUR CAR.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.259
ALREADY CUFFED!

11:49.300 --> 11:50.437
(Tancana)
ABOUT ANOTHER MILE
ON THIS ROAD,

11:50.470 --> 11:52.108
TURN LEFI' ON CABRILLO.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.279
I GO'I'I'A MAKE A STOP
AT A HOUSE DOWN THERE.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.471
GOT SOME BAD NEWS
FOR YOU, BUDDY.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.398
THE ONLY STOP WE'LL BE MAKING
IS AT THE POLICE STATION.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.508
I'M TURNING YOU IN.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.212
'CAUSE WE ARE BOUNTY HUNTERS.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.218
HE'S A BOUNTY HUNTER.
[laughing]

12:04.250 --> 12:06.184
I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL SALESMAN.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.381
THAT'S GOOD.
YOU'RE BOUNTY HUNTERS.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.387
WHAT IS EVERYBODY'S DEAL?

12:09.420 --> 12:10.785
LIKE, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

12:10.830 --> 12:12.183
IS IT BECAUSE
I'M NOT WEARING THE VEST?

12:12.230 --> 12:13.219
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

12:13.260 --> 12:14.295
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THE TRUTH IS,

12:14.330 --> 12:15.126
I'M A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.367
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
GALILEO HUMPKINS.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.867
YOU KNOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

12:18.900 --> 12:21.960
I'M GRATEFUL YOU DIDN'T
USE MY REAL NAME.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.228
ALL RIGHT, YOU ONE OF THOSE
PSYCHIC PEOPLE?

12:23.270 --> 12:26.262
ONE OF THOSE
CRYSTAL BALL PEOPLE?

12:26.310 --> 12:27.277
WELL, LOOK INTO YOUR
CRYSTAL BALL

12:27.310 --> 12:28.277
AND SEE THAT I'M INNOCENT.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.277
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

12:29.310 --> 12:31.244
RIGHT, YOU JUST ROB THEM.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.874
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I'M A THIEF.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.979
BUT I'M NOT A KILLER.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.045
I HAD A PARTNER IN THIS ONE,
GORD DELBECCHIO.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.910
GORD WANTED ME
TO BREAK INTO THE BASEMENT

12:39.960 --> 12:42.053
AND DISARM THE ALARM,
SO I DID.

12:42.090 --> 12:44.923
WOMAN WAS KILLED IN THE BEDROOM
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.222
AND I SWEAR I NEVER
EVEN SAW THE LADY.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.320
SURE.
THAT'S WHY YOU RAN?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.861
IF I WAS GUILTY,
DO YOU REALLY THINK

12:50.900 --> 12:52.788
I WOULD HAVE
STAYED IN THIS TOWN?

12:52.840 --> 12:53.898
THAT'S WHAT
YOUR ATTORNEY IS FOR.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.999
I DON'T HAVE
SOME SLICK ATTORNEY.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.302
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE AN ATTORNEY, MAN.

12:57.340 --> 13:00.002
I GOT A PUBLIC DEFENDER.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.031
YOU KNOW, I'M PROBABLY
FACING THE CHAIR ON THIS ONE.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.139
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THE COPS
ABOUT DELBECCHIO?

13:04.180 --> 13:05.204
IF I LET THE COPS
TRY TO FIND HIM,

13:05.250 --> 13:06.979
HE'D BE LONG GONE BY NOW.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.259
AW, THAT LOOKS PAINFUL.

13:14.290 --> 13:15.552
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

13:15.590 --> 13:18.320
YOU JUST
LET HIM GET AWAY.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.429
THERE WAS
NOTHING I COULD DO.

13:19.460 --> 13:20.495
HE DROVE OFF IN A CAR.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.020
DID YOU MANAGE
TO GET A PLATE?

13:22.060 --> 13:23.527
NO.
BUT IT WAS A BLUE ECHO.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.368
IT WAS A CHILD'S CAR.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.162
HE WAS WITH THOSE IDIOTS,
YOU KNOW?

13:27.200 --> 13:28.838
THE PSYCHIC
AND THE OTHER IDIOT.

13:32.110 --> 13:36.206
[cell phone ringing]

13:36.240 --> 13:37.241
LASSIE, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:37.280 --> 13:39.043
IT'S LASSIE.

13:39.950 --> 13:43.044
YES, I DO KNOW
WHAT UNCERTAIN TERMS ARE.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.183
I'M THE ONE
THAT HAD TO TELL GUS.

13:45.220 --> 13:46.244
NO, YOU LISTEN
TO ME, SPENCER, ALL RIGHT?

13:46.290 --> 13:48.349
YOU GET BACK HERE NOW
OR I WILL CHARGE YOU BOTH

13:48.390 --> 13:49.948
WITH HARBORING A FUGITIVE.

13:49.990 --> 13:50.979
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

13:51.030 --> 13:52.452
WOW, SOMEBODY DIDN'T DRINK

13:52.490 --> 13:55.288
THEIR GRATEFUL JUICE
THIS MORNING.

13:55.330 --> 13:56.422
WE'RE FINE, OKAY?

13:56.460 --> 13:57.427
HE'S CUFFED.
I'M BRINGING HIM BACK IN.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.960
YOU'RE WELCOME.

13:59.000 --> 13:59.762
DO ME A FAVOR,

13:59.800 --> 14:02.030
PUT JULES ON THE PHONE
FOR A SECOND.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.207
OOH, DUDE! LABRADOODLE.
WHERE?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.299
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.568
SHAWN, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

14:06.610 --> 14:07.577
LET US SEND
SOME BLACK AND WHITES.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.475
YOU WANT
A BLACK AND WHITE COOKIE?

14:09.510 --> 14:10.477
TANCANA, YOU WANT A COOKIE?

14:10.510 --> 14:12.501
CAN'T EAT WHEAT OR YEAST.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.541
SHAWN, I'M SERIOUS.
JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

14:14.580 --> 14:17.219
YEAH, SO THAT WE CAN'T COLLECT
THE $50,000 BOUNTY.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.138
I DON'T THINK SO.
WE'RE CLOSE, OKAY?

14:19.190 --> 14:20.384
BUT ANSWER ME THIS.

14:20.420 --> 14:23.127
WHAT DO YOU KNOW

14:23.160 --> 14:24.229
GORD.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.454
GORD DELBECCHIO.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.629
SHAWN, DON'T BUY
INTO TANCANA'S STORY.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.093
WE HAVE CHECKED OUT
DELBECCHIO.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.324
HE HAS A RECORD.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.224
HE USED TO PARTNER UP
WITH TANCANA,

14:32.270 --> 14:33.532
BUT HE DIDN'T THIS TIME,
OKAY?

14:33.570 --> 14:35.561
JUST GET IN HERE.
AND BE CAREFUL.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.033
ADMIT IT,
YOU'RE A LITTLE TURNED ON

14:37.070 --> 14:38.037

AREN'T YOU?

14:42.510 --> 14:44.239

14:44.280 --> 14:47.579
I MEAN, THAT'S A GIVEN.
IT'S A SEXY THING.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.440

JULES?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.254
JULES?

14:55.290 --> 14:56.928
IS IT BECAUSE
I'M NOT WEARING A VEST?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.587
IS IT THE VEST?

14:58.630 --> 15:00.257
HELLO?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.426
I THINK

LOOK, WE NEVER MADE

15:03.300 --> 15:04.927
ANY ACTUAL CASH
FROM THE COLE ROBBERY.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.234
DELBECCHIO KEPT TALKING
ABOUT WORKING SOMETHING

15:07.270 --> 15:08.464
A LOT BIGGER.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.309

BLOWING ABOUT ALL THE CASH

15:10.340 --> 15:11.500
HE WAS GONNA MAKE.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.030
I THINK I KNOW
WHERE'S HE'S HIDING OUT.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.502
IT'S ONLY, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES
OUT OF THE WAY.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.178

15:19.550 --> 15:20.619
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:20.650 --> 15:22.470
WHAT IS THAT FACE, SHAWN?

15:22.520 --> 15:23.589
I DON'T LIKE THAT FACE.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.383
I'M SENSING SOMETHING, GUS.

15:25.420 --> 15:26.387
THAT'S WHAT I DO,
I'M A PSYCHIC.

15:26.420 --> 15:27.409
I SENSE THINGS, REMEMBER?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.348
NO, SHAWN, YOU'RE NOT
DOING THIS TO ME AGAIN.

15:29.390 --> 15:30.618
NO, NOT THIS TIME.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.457
NOT WITH A CRIMINAL
IN THE BACK OF MY CAR.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.424
GUS, DON'T BE A LITTLE GIRL
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

15:34.460 --> 15:35.358
IT'S ONLY GONNA
TAKE FIVE MINUTES.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.459
I'M THE ONE
DRIVING THIS CAR RIGHT NOW.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.968
AND THIS CAR IS GOING
TO THE POLICE STATION.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.059
WHERE ALL THE POLICE ARE.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.472
[phone ringing]

15:53.520 --> 15:56.273
HELLO?
GOT IT.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.641
THEY'VE GOT HIM!
DOWNSTAIRS IN HIS CAR!

15:58.690 --> 16:01.682
YOU'RE KIDDING.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.108
I WAN NA THANK YOU
FOR A VERY COLORFUL

16:18.140 --> 16:20.279
AND EVENTFUL STINT
AS A BOUNTY HUNTER, SHAWN.

16:20.310 --> 16:24.144
BUT CONSIDER ME RETIRED.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.647
WELL, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.113
NOW YOU GOT A STORY
IF YOU EVER GO ON LETTERMAN.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.219
TERRIFIC.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.218
NOW I'M GONNA HEAD HOME,
TAKE A LONG NAP,

16:30.250 --> 16:33.014
AND WAIT FOR THE BRUISES
TO SHOW UP ON MY WRIST.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.186
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS
PRETTY GOOD.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.619
I'LL COME ALONG.

16:35.660 --> 16:38.151
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE'VE NAPPED TOGETHER.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.327
LET'S MAKE A QUICK STOP FIRST.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.793
(Gus)
THIS IS NOT A QUICK STOP,
SHAWN!

16:49.840 --> 16:51.330
SORRY, MY DAD'S BOAT
ONLY GOES SO FAST.

16:51.370 --> 16:53.634
I THOUGHT I WAS CLEAR.
I'M RETIRED!

16:55.280 --> 16:57.578
WILL YOU STOP DOING THAT?

16:57.610 --> 16:59.100
HE SAID TAKE A RIGHT
AT CABRILLO,

16:59.150 --> 17:00.549
HEAD FOR THE PIER
TO A HOUSE.

17:00.580 --> 17:03.242
YOU DO REALIZE WE'RE NOT
ON LAND ANYMORE, RIGHT?

17:03.290 --> 17:04.245
HE SAID HOUSE.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.316
BUT WHAT HE MEANT
WAS HOUSEBOAT.

17:08.620 --> 17:09.757
IT'S NOT A TOURIST SPOT.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.223
THAT'S NOT A FISHING HOLE.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.682
THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE THERE.

17:15.830 --> 17:18.321
[engine rewing]

17:24.810 --> 17:26.209
I'M NOT GETTING
ON THIS BOAT, SHAWN.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.229
SSSH.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.235
IF DELBECCHIO'S
ON THE BOAT,

17:28.280 --> 17:29.770
HE CAN HEAR US.

17:29.810 --> 17:31.243
TOSS ME THAT ROPE, BUDDY.

17:32.780 --> 17:34.418
THAN KS.

17:34.450 --> 17:37.419
NOW, LISTEN, I'M OKAY
WITH YOU STAYING ON THE BOAT.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.179
JUST BE CAREFUL OF SHARKS.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.858
I'M NOT SURE
MY DAD'S LITTLE SKIFF

17:40.890 --> 17:42.619
IS SHARK SAFE.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.834
DUDE, I'M PRETTY SURE THIS
IS THE BOAT FROM DEAD CALM.

17:54.870 --> 17:57.134
GREAT, NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT BILLY ZANE TOO?

17:57.170 --> 17:59.707
SHH.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.201
[thud]

18:09.320 --> 18:11.185
PSYCHIC BLOODHOUND
JUST COULDN'T LEAVE IT BE, HUH?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.642
EASY, EASY.
TAKE IT EASY.

18:12.690 --> 18:14.180
I TOLD YOU
BACK AT THE STATION

18:14.220 --> 18:15.653
I'M GONNA DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO
TO CLEAR MY NAME.

18:15.690 --> 18:16.782
IF THAT'S COMING
TO DELBECCHIO'S HIDEOUT

18:16.820 --> 18:19.288
AND FINDING THE EVIDENCE,
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.627
(Shawn)
OKAY.

18:20.660 --> 18:24.289
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
PUT DOWN THE FISH BONKER...

18:24.330 --> 18:25.627
YOU'RE MAKING GUS
VERY NERVOUS.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.365
AND LET ME DO
WHAT IT IS I DO, DWAYNE.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.436
I CAN HELP YOU.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.870
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE A SHOT.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.507
THANK YOU.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.643
HUH.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.117
LOOK AT THAT.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.327
MONEY BANDS.

18:52.490 --> 18:55.721
USUALLY USED TO PACK
2 OR $3,000 STACKS.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.762
I TOLD YOU HE WAS WORKING
ON SOME CASH DEAL.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.290
(Shawn)
YES, YOU DID.

18:59.330 --> 19:00.797
(Gus)
I THINK
I JUST FOUND HIS PHONE.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.829
WELL, TURN IT ON.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

19:01.870 --> 19:04.361
BATTERY'S DEAD.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.230
JUST HOLD ON TO IT.

[gaSPSI

19:26.360 --> 19:27.827
OH!

19:28.930 --> 19:30.192
I BELIEVE ISABELLA COLE
WAS WEARING THIS

19:30.230 --> 19:31.197
WHEN SHE WAS KILLED.

19:31.230 --> 19:32.458
THAT PUTS DELBECCHIO

19:32.500 --> 19:33.467
AT LEAST CLOSE ENOUGH
TO THE BODY

19:33.500 --> 19:34.831
TO SNATCH THIS OFF.

19:34.870 --> 19:35.837
IT'S EVIDENCE.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.303
CIRCUMSTANTIAL,

19:37.340 --> 19:38.307
BUT IT COULD
LEAD TO SOMETHING.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.432
[gunshot]

[cell phone ringing]

19:45.410 --> 19:46.377

YEAH, HEY, SHAWN.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.211
YOU STILL COMING OVER

19:50.250 --> 19:51.285
HOLD ON A SEC.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.912
ARE WILL STILL GOING TO DINNER
AT MY DAD'S TONIGHT?

19:52.950 --> 19:54.281
UH, LOOK, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, DAD.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.582
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.326
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE ON A BOAT.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.452
[gunshot]

19:59.490 --> 20:00.821
NO, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

20:00.860 --> 20:01.895
WE'RE JUST--WE'RE SITTING
IN THE PSYCH OFFICE

20:01.930 --> 20:03.227
WATCHING A MOVIE.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.396
MIDNIGHT RUN.
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

20:04.430 --> 20:06.364
[gunshot]

20:07.670 --> 20:09.467
I GOT THIS.
I GOT THIS!

20:18.880 --> 20:19.847
(Byrd)
OPEN IT UP!

20:19.880 --> 20:21.347
I WILL SHOOT YOU!

20:21.380 --> 20:25.612
OPEN IT!

LET'S GO!

20:38.030 --> 20:41.568
WE ARE OUT OF HERE!

YOU DIDN'T TII/IIEUP THE BOAT?

20:42.840 --> 20:44.808
LAST GUY OUT THE BOAT
TIES IT UP!

20:44.840 --> 20:45.807
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT!

20:45.840 --> 20:46.932
YOU ASKED FOR THE ROPE!

20:46.970 --> 20:47.834
WHY WOULD YOU
ASK FOR THE ROPE

20:47.880 --> 20:48.835
IF YOU DIDN'T INTEND
ON TYING IT UP, SHAWN?

20:48.880 --> 20:50.939
WHAT ARE YOU, THE AMBASSADOR
OF ROPE ETIQUETTE?

20:50.980 --> 20:51.969

20:57.320 --> 20:59.379

20:59.420 --> 21:00.216

THIS TIME...

21:00.250 --> 21:02.616
I REALLY AM
GONNA SHOOT YOU GUYS.

SHAWN, IF WE EVER

21:23.350 --> 21:25.306
GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE,
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

21:25.350 --> 21:28.069
WHOA!

21:28.120 --> 21:29.473
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME!

21:29.520 --> 21:32.739
HOW CAN A MAN THAT BIG
HAVE SO MUCH STAMINA?

21:32.790 --> 21:34.417
[boat engine rewing]

21:34.460 --> 21:35.552
HEY!

21:39.730 --> 21:41.459
HEY!

21:41.500 --> 21:42.990
I'M A PSYCHIC!

21:43.030 --> 21:46.022
I CAN TELL YOU
WHERE HE'S GOING!

21:51.510 --> 21:52.704
LOOK.
I TOLD YOU SHE'D BE HERE.

21:52.740 --> 21:54.731
WOW, SHE REALLY IS
TAKING THIS TO HEART.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.674
HEY, JULES, YOU OKAY?

22:00.720 --> 22:03.541
JULIET.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:03.590 --> 22:06.889
CATCHING UP
ON SOME SUMMER READING?

22:06.920 --> 22:08.410
GUS AND I WERE ALMOST
MURDERED HERE EARLIER,

22:08.460 --> 22:10.826
SO WE CAME BACK
FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS.

22:10.860 --> 22:14.557
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE AN INTERNAL VOICE

22:14.600 --> 22:16.090
THAT TELLS YOU
WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS

22:16.130 --> 22:17.893
ALL OF THE TIME
AND YOU DO IT,

22:17.930 --> 22:20.660
AND IT WORKS AND YOU'RE GOOD
AT WHAT YOU DO,

22:20.700 --> 22:22.691
AND THEN ONE DAY
IT JUST SHUTS OFF?

22:22.740 --> 22:24.537
AND IN THAT MOMENT
THERE IS NO VOICE,

22:24.570 --> 22:26.037
AND YOU JUST
HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

22:26.070 --> 22:28.129
AND IN AN INSTANT,
IN A MILLISECOND,

22:28.180 --> 22:30.398
YOU MAKE A TINY,
BUT CRUCIAL MISTAKE

22:30.450 --> 22:32.702
AND SCREW UP SO BADLY
IT AFFECT S YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.615
NO, I DO NOT.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.515
BUT GUS HERE MIGHT.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.585
LOOK, I PROMISE YOU,
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

22:39.620 --> 22:40.882
AND WE'RE GONNA
BRING HIM BACK IN.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.512
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
DO THAT, SHAWN?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.778
BECAUSE I HAVE
BEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.821
I HAVE COMBED THESE PHOTOS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

22:46.860 --> 22:48.521
LOOKING FOR ANYTHING,
ANY CLUES,

22:48.560 --> 22:50.118
AND I KEEP COMING UP
WITH A BIG, FAT ZERO.

22:50.160 --> 22:50.922
NOTHING.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.597
(Gus)
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:52.630 --> 22:53.528
YOU'RE JUST GIVING UP?

22:53.570 --> 22:54.764
NO, I JUST HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE STATION

22:54.800 --> 22:56.631
TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING.

22:56.670 --> 22:57.659
BE MY GUEST.

23:07.550 --> 23:10.610
THEY PHOTOGRAPH ED
HIS TATTOOS.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.548
LOOK AT THIS ONE.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.581
IT LOOKS HANDMADE,
LIKE A PRISON TATTOO.

23:13.620 --> 23:14.655
BARB.

23:14.690 --> 23:17.181
IT COULD BE A GIRLFRIEND
OR AN EX.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.323
WE CAN CROSSCHECK
FOR WOMEN

23:18.360 --> 23:20.749
NAMED BARB OR BARBARA
WHO MAY HAVE RUN IN HIS CIRCLES.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.926
HE COULD BE HIDING OUT
WITH HER.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.605
GUS?
WHAT?

23:32.640 --> 23:35.871
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

23:53.090 --> 23:56.594
NOT EXACTLY FAMILY FRIENDLY
HERE.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.690
JUST PRETEND
LIKE WE'RE IN ROAD HOUSE.

23:59.730 --> 24:00.867
FINE, BUT I'M PATRICK SWAYZE.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.697
SAM ELLIOTT.

24:02.740 --> 24:05.004
EXCUSE ME, GOOD SIR?

24:05.040 --> 24:07.235
I'D LIKE TO SEE A LIST OF
YOUR CALIFORNIA WHITES, PLEASE.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.773
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
WHICH FRATERNITY

24:09.810 --> 24:11.641
DARED YOU
TO WALK IN HERE,

24:11.680 --> 24:13.102
BUT YOU BETTER
RUN ON BACK TO CAMPUS

24:13.150 --> 24:15.869
BEFORE YOU GET BEAT SO BAD,
IT'S GONNA HURT TO CRY.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.616
ACTUALLY,
WE'RE MEETING A FRIEND HERE.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.754
DWAYNE TANCANA.
YOU KNOW HIM?

24:20.790 --> 24:21.916
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.211
MM, BUMMER.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.488
LET'S GO.
DUDE, I GOT THIS.

24:24.530 --> 24:25.622
REALLY!

24:25.660 --> 24:29.096
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE TELLING ME
THE TRUTH, GIANT GUY.

24:29.130 --> 24:30.563
I KNOW HE'S HERE.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.794
ABOUT YAY HIGH,
COVERED IN TATS.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.730
PISCES.
LOVES TO RUN.

24:33.770 --> 24:34.794
LOOK, LET'S NOT PLAY GAMES.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.707
DON'T EMBARRASS YOURSELF
WITH THIS TOUGH GUY ROUTINE.

24:37.740 --> 24:38.729
TELL YOU WHAT,

24:38.770 --> 24:40.738
I'M GONNA COUNT TO THREE.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.601
ONE.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.606
TWO.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.572
[rowdy yelling]

24:47.620 --> 24:49.975
NICE WORK, SHAWN.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.611
[chain clanking]

24:58.160 --> 24:59.684
I GOT IT!

24:59.730 --> 25:01.220
I SAID, I GOT IT.

25:01.260 --> 25:02.818
THERE YOU ARE!

25:02.860 --> 25:04.589
THEY CAME HERE
LOOKING FOR ME,

25:04.630 --> 25:05.597
SO I GOT IT.

25:05.630 --> 25:10.829
NOW LET 'EM DOWN.

25:12.340 --> 25:13.705
LET ME GO!

25:13.740 --> 25:14.900
LET ME--STOP!
LET ME GO!

25:14.940 --> 25:16.532
YOU'RE LUCKY.

25:16.580 --> 25:17.547
AND MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU MIGHT

25:17.580 --> 25:18.649
THINK ABOUT A TIC-TAC.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.978
I GOTTA SAY,
I'M IMPRESSED, SHAWN.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.169
BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
THIS WHOLE

25:23.220 --> 25:24.209
PSYCHIC ABILITY THING.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.615
YOU TRACKED ME HERE.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.742
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

25:26.790 --> 25:27.757
DWAYN E.

25:27.790 --> 25:28.757
MM-HMM?

25:28.790 --> 25:30.621
WHAT I REALLY NEED FROM YOU

25:30.660 --> 25:34.699
IS TO LET US TAKE YOU BACK
TO THE POLICE STATION

25:34.730 --> 25:36.698
AND INTO CUSTODY?

25:36.730 --> 25:40.837
[laughter]

25:40.870 --> 25:44.169
IF YOU TWO
TRY TO TAKE ME IN,

25:44.210 --> 25:45.962
MY FRIENDS WILL KILL YOU.

25:46.010 --> 25:49.173
AND IF BY SOME
STRANGE STROKE OF LUCK,

25:49.210 --> 25:50.973
YOU MANAGE
TO GET ME HANDCUFFED,

25:51.010 --> 25:53.615
I'LL ESCAPE, BECAUSE I'VE
DONE IT BEFORE.

25:53.650 --> 25:57.643
DUDE, THAT'S WHAT WE FORGOT.
CUFFS.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.341
THERE'S A WAY OUT, THOUGH.

26:00.390 --> 26:01.357
I'LL WALK OUT
THE FRONT DOOR WITH YOU,

26:01.390 --> 26:03.119
JUST THE THREE OF US.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.628
IF--IF YOU USE
YOUR PSYCHIC ABILITY

26:05.660 --> 26:06.684
TO HELP ME
FIND DELBECCHIO.

26:06.730 --> 26:07.856
PROVE MY INNOCENCE.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.856
SO, YOU GOT A DECISION
TO MAKE.

26:09.900 --> 26:12.164
ARE YOU GOING TO ACCEPT
MY GENEROUS OFFER,

26:12.200 --> 26:14.134
OR AM I GONNA TURN YOU OVER
TO MY FRIENDS?

26:14.170 --> 26:15.296
THEY DON'T PLAY NICE.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.308
I'LL DO IT.
ONE CONDITION.

26:18.340 --> 26:19.329
WHAT?

26:19.370 --> 26:21.201
I GET THAT GUY'S VEST.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.000
ALL RIGHT,
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.779
SWING BY THE PSYCH OFFICE,

26:25.810 --> 26:28.847
PLUG IN DELBECCHIO'S PHONE,
SEE IF ANYTHING SURVIVED

26:28.880 --> 26:30.848
THE WATER DAMAGE
CAUSED BY GUS.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.778
CAUSED?
THAT I CAUSED?

26:32.820 --> 26:33.752
THAT I CAUSED?

26:33.790 --> 26:35.678
MAYBE IF SOMEONE
WOULD HAVE TIED UP THE BOAT,

26:35.720 --> 26:36.948
WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SWIMMING AROUND

26:36.990 --> 26:38.218
LIKE THE COUPLE
FROM OPEN WATER.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.027
(male cop)
THERE'S ONE GUY
RIGHT THERE AT THE DOCK.

26:46.070 --> 26:47.799
DID YOU RUN THE REGISTRATION?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.137
YES, IT JUST CAME THROUGH.

26:49.170 --> 26:51.661
IT'S REGISTERED
TO DELBECCHIO

26:51.710 --> 26:52.699
SINCE 2001.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.002
ALL RIGHT,
GOOD WORK, DETECTIVE.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.837
GONNA COMB THIS PLACE
FOR TANCANA'S PRINTS.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.370
HE MUST BE AFTER DELBECCHIO
FOR SOME REASON.

26:57.410 --> 27:00.049
OKAY.
GOOD.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.069
[sighs]

27:07.790 --> 27:08.779
DUCK, IT'S BYRD!

27:09.820 --> 27:11.981
GREAT, NOW WE CAN'T EVEN GO
TO OUR OWN OFFICE?

27:12.030 --> 27:14.396
BYRD IS STALKING US NOW.

27:14.430 --> 27:15.249
WE'RE HARBORING A FUGITIVE,
SHAWN.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.167
WHERE ARE WE GONNA GO
WITH A FUGITIVE?

27:21.440 --> 27:25.103
YEAH, YOU CAN...
YOU CAN PLAY WITH THAT.

27:25.140 --> 27:26.767
GUS!

27:26.810 --> 27:27.777
[laughing]

27:27.810 --> 27:28.902
DUDE, WOULD YOU HURRY UP?

27:28.940 --> 27:30.202
JUST DRY IT OFF ALREADY.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.309
I'M NOT SURE
WHEN MY DAD'S GETTING HOME.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.045
I CAN'T WILL IT
TO DRY FASTER, SHAWN.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.139
AND I'M NOT PLUGGING THIS IN
UNTIL ALL SIGNS OF MOISTURE

27:35.180 --> 27:36.147
HAVE BEEN CLEARED.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.340
I CHEATED DEATH
TH REE TIMES

27:37.380 --> 27:38.745
IN THE LAST SEVEN HOURS.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.314
AND I'M NOT GOING OUT
BY ELECT ROCUTION.

27:40.350 --> 27:42.454
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE WERE SAFE HERE, ANYWAY.

27:42.490 --> 27:43.457
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S
AT THE GROCERY STORE

27:43.490 --> 27:44.821
GETTING STUFF FOR THE DINNER,

27:44.860 --> 27:47.078
BUT I CAN'T WILL HIM

27:47.130 --> 27:49.121
SQUEEZING MELONS,

27:49.160 --> 27:50.764
REALLY?

27:50.800 --> 27:51.767
OH, HEY, SHAWN!

27:51.800 --> 27:53.461
HEY, DAD!

27:53.500 --> 27:54.831

27:54.870 --> 27:55.859
OH, WE'RE EXCITED!
WE'RE GONNA EAT.

27:55.900 --> 27:56.992
WE'RE GONNA...
GUSTER!

27:57.040 --> 27:58.337
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
MESSING AROUND

27:58.370 --> 27:59.337
WITH MY CRAP OVER THERE?

27:59.370 --> 28:00.405
STOP.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.771
OH, I'M JUST
CHARGING MY PHONE.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.949
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.778

LOOKED US UP.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.458
GAVE US A CALL.

28:28.770 --> 28:30.237
WHAT CAMP WAS THAT AGAIN?

28:30.270 --> 28:31.760
OH, DAD,
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING

28:31.810 --> 28:33.163
FROM MY CHILDHOOD.

28:33.210 --> 28:36.873
IT'S CAMP TIKI...MAMA...JAMA.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.446

28:43.350 --> 28:45.910

28:48.460 --> 28:49.882
(Gus)
OH, NO.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.081
HE CAN'T EAT THAT.
DO YOU HAVE EGG WHITES?

28:52.130 --> 28:53.449
(Shawn)
SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD

28:53.490 --> 28:55.958
AND LET YOU TWO
GET MORE ACQUAINTED.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.126

29:04.010 --> 29:06.433
[sighs]

29:06.470 --> 29:08.335
I STILL CAN'T GET IT TO WORK.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.132
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK TANCANA
CAN STALL IN THERE?

29:10.180 --> 29:12.944
NOT LONG.
WAIT, I GOT IT.

29:12.980 --> 29:14.868
THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT?

29:14.920 --> 29:15.739
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

29:15.780 --> 29:17.509
WHEN YOU DROP
CELL PHONES IN WATER.

29:17.550 --> 29:19.916
SHAWN.

29:48.850 --> 29:49.817
IS THAT RIGHT?

29:49.850 --> 29:50.817
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
PICK A LETTER.

29:50.850 --> 29:52.488

30:07.100 --> 30:09.489
FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE DEAD.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.132
SECONDLY, OF COURSE
I SOLVED THE PUZZLE.

30:11.170 --> 30:12.535
THE SECOND THAT I SAW IT.

30:12.570 --> 30:14.879
MEADOW PARK.

30:14.910 --> 30:16.002
I DON'T HAVE
A HI-TOP FADE, SHAWN.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.530
GOOGLE MEADOW PARK.

30:21.150 --> 30:22.412
SO DELBECCHIO
WAS MEETING SOMEONE

30:22.450 --> 30:24.338

30:48.540 --> 30:50.007

30:50.040 --> 30:51.439
NAH, COME ON, I'M SURE
YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.640
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.045
TAKE ME RIGHT BACK
TO MY KID'S CAMP DAYS.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.638

33:40.180 --> 33:41.249
HOW?

33:41.280 --> 33:42.816
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE $50,000

33:42.850 --> 33:44.215

34:06.340 --> 34:08.205
A BUNCH OF EXPIRED

34:17.420 --> 34:18.580
OH, RIGHT NOW?

34:18.620 --> 34:21.350
I'M ABOUT 30 SECONDS AWAY
FROM COLLECTING 50,000 BUCKS,

34:21.390 --> 34:22.857
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

34:22.890 --> 34:27.725
OOH, $50,000.
NICE, THAT'S VERY EXCITING.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.853
THAT'S A LOT OF SHOT GLASSES
THAT SAY "BYRD" ON THEM.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.118
GET TO THE POINT, SPENCER.
AND MAKE IT FAST.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.592
WELL,
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS.

34:33.630 --> 34:34.790
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT
OF MONEY

34:34.840 --> 34:36.637
STASHED AWAY
FROM THE ROBBERY.

34:36.670 --> 34:39.400
YEAH, TANCANA TOLD US
WHERE IT WAS.

34:39.440 --> 34:44.400
AND NOW ALL THAT MONEY
IS IN MY BRIEFCASE.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.644
IS THIS A BRIEFCASE
OR AN ATTACHE?

34:45.680 --> 34:47.272
I THINK IT'S A BRIEFCASE.

34:47.310 --> 34:49.210
ATTACHES HAVE
A SOFTER SHELL.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.672
REALLY, THAT'S ALL
THAT DIFFERENTIATES THEM,

34:50.720 --> 34:51.880
A SOFTER SHELL?

34:51.920 --> 34:54.388
WELL, ATTACHE DOES HAVE
A BETTER RING TO IT.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.115
LET'S GO WITH ATTACHE.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.411
GET TO IT, SPENCER.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.348
LOOK, YOU SAID THIS WAS
YOUR LAST HURRAH, RIGHT?

34:59.390 --> 35:02.223
WHY NOT MAKE IT
A REALLY, REALLY FAT ONE?

35:02.260 --> 35:04.569
WE'LL TRADE YOU
WHAT'S IN THE ATTACHE

35:04.600 --> 35:06.727
FOR TANCANA, STRAIGHT UP.

35:06.770 --> 35:08.533
WIN-WIN.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.265
NOW, WOULD I WANNA DO THAT?

35:10.300 --> 35:12.768
BECAUSE
WHAT'S IN THE ATTACHE...

35:12.810 --> 35:14.334
ATTACHE SOUNDS PRETENTIOUS,
DUDE.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.779
WELL, IT COULD BE
THE WAY YOU'RE SAYING IT.

35:15.810 --> 35:16.879
YOU SAY IT.

35:16.910 --> 35:18.275
ATTACHE.

35:18.310 --> 35:20.870
WHAT'S IN THE BRIEFCASE
IS FOUR TIMES MORE

35:20.910 --> 35:22.343
THAN WHAT COLE'S
GONNA PAY YOU.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.813
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
PLAYING ALONG AT HOME,

35:23.850 --> 35:26.387
THAT'S $200,000.

35:26.420 --> 35:27.444
SO WHY WOULDN'T YOU
TAKE THE MONEY?

35:27.490 --> 35:28.514
YOU ALLERGIC?

35:28.560 --> 35:29.686
NO, WE LOVE MONEY.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.358
PARTICULARLY GUS.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.789
BUT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT
DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.388
WE'RE DOING IT
FOR THE GIRL.

35:34.430 --> 35:35.454
YOU KNOW WHAT, SHAWN,

35:35.500 --> 35:36.250
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.756
THIS GUY
WOULDN'T KNOW A GOOD DEAL

35:37.800 --> 35:38.824
IF IT BIT HIM IN THE SEAT
OF HIS HAN SOLO

35:38.870 --> 35:40.462
ACTION FIGURE PANTS.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.330
NO, WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

35:41.370 --> 35:42.792
WAIT.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.138
FINE.
TOSS ME THE MONEY.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.806
[laughing]

35:48.840 --> 35:52.401
YOU THINK THIS IS MY FIRST
MONEY-FOR-HOSTAGE EXCHANGE?

35:52.450 --> 35:53.599
NO.

35:53.650 --> 35:56.369
FIRST YOU GIVE US TANCANA,
AND THEN...

35:56.420 --> 35:58.809
GUS TOSSES YOU THE BRIEFCASE.

35:58.850 --> 36:01.318
NO, I WANNA
SEE THE MONEY FIRST.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.884
SURE, AND WHY DON'T WE JUST
INVITE THE WHOLE

36:02.920 --> 36:04.683
POLICE FORCE OUT
TO COUNT IT FOR YOU

36:04.730 --> 36:05.719
WHILE WE'RE AT IT?
* YOO-HOO

36:05.760 --> 36:06.829
[laughing]

36:06.860 --> 36:10.455
SAME TIME, BYRD.
SAME TIME.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.467
I'LL COUNT TO THREE.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.627
ONE...

36:13.670 --> 36:16.537
TWO...

36:16.570 --> 36:18.333
TH REE.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.258
AAH!

36:26.310 --> 36:27.470
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

36:27.510 --> 36:28.716
THAT WAS YOUR BIG PLAN?

36:28.750 --> 36:29.717
REALLY?

36:29.750 --> 36:30.717
REALLY, SHAWN?

36:30.750 --> 36:34.754
NO, THIS WAS THE PLAN.

36:34.790 --> 36:35.814
[whispering]
THANK YOU.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.258
WHY IS HE WINKING AT ME?

36:39.290 --> 36:41.451
IT'S INVOLU NTARY.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.751
YOU GOT HIM.
THANK GOD.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.290
WHAT KIND OF AN IDIOT
PULLS A GUN

36:44.330 --> 36:45.297
IN FRONT OF A POLICE STATION?

36:45.330 --> 36:46.592
DROP IT, BYRD.

36:46.630 --> 36:47.927
I HAVE A LICENSE TO CARRY.

36:47.970 --> 36:49.733
I'M LICENSED TO ARREST.

36:49.770 --> 36:50.998
NOW, AS MUCH AS I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT SHOOTING THESE TWO

36:51.040 --> 36:52.007
FROM TIME TO TIME,

36:52.040 --> 36:55.237
YOU CANNOT PULL A GUN
ON INNOCENT CIVILIANS.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.305
SO DROP IT!
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.807
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

36:58.850 --> 37:02.274
LET'S TAKE YOU INSIDE
TO COOL OFF, BOUNTY HUNTER.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.845
PASS ME THE SATCHEL.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.914
OOH, SATCHEL!

37:05.950 --> 37:06.917
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT ONE.

37:06.950 --> 37:08.611
I THINK THINGS ARE GONNA
GO A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

37:08.660 --> 37:09.615
THIS TIME.

37:09.660 --> 37:10.649
LET'S GO.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.697
THANK YOU.

37:14.730 --> 37:16.288
I'M SORRY
I DOUBTED YOU GUYS.

37:16.330 --> 37:18.594
IT'S OKAY.
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.395
[yawns]

37:22.440 --> 37:23.395
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BUDDY?

37:23.440 --> 37:25.032
HOW ABOUT THAT NAP?

37:25.070 --> 37:27.436
SHAWN, ARE YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

37:27.470 --> 37:28.505
I KNOW.
YOU NEED A NIGHT-LIGHT.

37:28.540 --> 37:30.599
SHAWN!

37:30.640 --> 37:33.302
OH, RIGHT.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.044
WHOA, GUYS!
HOLD UP, HOLD UP!

37:36.080 --> 37:37.945
SORRY, WITH THE WHOLE
GUNS DRAWN THING

37:37.980 --> 37:40.448
AND ALL THE SCREAMING

37:40.490 --> 37:41.684
AND BYRD'S RIDICULOUS
FEATHERY HAIR,

37:41.720 --> 37:43.051
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU...

37:43.090 --> 37:44.580
YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY.

37:44.630 --> 37:45.881
AND IT'S NOT

37:45.930 --> 37:48.626
JUST A MURDER,
IT'S A DOUBLE MURDER.

37:48.660 --> 37:49.922
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:49.960 --> 37:51.029
IT'S COLE!

37:51.060 --> 37:52.527
IT'S LOMAN COLE!

37:52.570 --> 37:54.458
HE MUST HAVE BEEN PLANNING
ON MURDERING HIS WIFE,

37:54.500 --> 37:56.559
BECAUSE HE USED THE BREAK-IN
AS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

37:56.600 --> 37:58.067
TO STRANGLE HER.

37:58.100 --> 38:00.466
AND PIN IT ON TANCANA,
A CAREER CRIMINAL,

38:00.510 --> 38:01.408
WHO WOULD GO DOWN EASY,
RIGHT?

38:01.440 --> 38:03.670
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

38:03.710 --> 38:06.304
HE EVEN KNOCKED HIMSELF OUT
WITH A VASE

38:06.350 --> 38:07.749
TO SELL THE BREAK-IN.

38:08.950 --> 38:11.487
WHEN YOU'RE UNCONSCIOUS.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.509
WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WAS THAT TANCANA

38:12.550 --> 38:14.450
WASN'T ALONE
IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT.

38:14.490 --> 38:16.481
HIS PARTNER, DELBECCHIO,
WAS ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.921
AND HE'S THE ONE
WHO ACTUALLY SAW YOU.

38:19.960 --> 38:23.054
HE STOLE THE NECKLACE
OFF YOUR DEAD WIFE'S BODY,

38:23.100 --> 38:25.466
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.762
SO HE CONTACTED YOU,
TOLD YOU THAT HE SAW

38:26.800 --> 38:27.994
YOU KILL YOUR WIFE,

38:28.030 --> 38:30.464
AND BLACKMAILED YOU
IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SILENCE.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.934
DELBECCHIO KEPT TALKING
ABOUT WORKING SOMETHING BIGGER.

38:32.970 --> 38:35.609
BLOWING ABOUT ALL THE CASH
HE WAS GONNA MAKE.

38:35.640 --> 38:36.800
YOU PAID HIM ONCE.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.899
BUT THEN HE WANTED MORE.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.009
SO YOU SET UP A DROP-OFF

38:41.050 --> 38:43.109
AT THE MEADOW
PARKING GARAGE.

38:43.150 --> 38:46.642
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU APPLIED
THE OLD COLE SPECIALTY MOVE.

38:46.690 --> 38:47.588
[unzipping]

38:47.620 --> 38:49.019
THE STRANGLE.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.118
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT

38:50.160 --> 38:52.628
IF IT WASN'T
FOR YOUR OWN GREEDINESS.

38:52.660 --> 38:53.649
WHAT GREEDINESS?

38:53.690 --> 38:55.021
I HAVE ALL THE MONEY
I NEED.

38:55.060 --> 38:56.618
NOT GREEDINESS FOR MONEY.

38:56.660 --> 38:59.527
GREEDINESS FOR
FABULOUS HAIR.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.561
UNLIKE YOUR POOR,
DEFENSELESS WIFE,

39:01.600 --> 39:03.397
DELBECCHIO FOUGHT BACK.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.429
OH, I CAN SEE IT.

39:04.470 --> 39:05.698
I CAN SEE IT
VERY CLEARLY NOW!

39:05.740 --> 39:07.628
[sniffing]

39:07.670 --> 39:09.672
BUT MOSTLY...
[sniffing]

39:09.710 --> 39:11.132
MOSTLY I CAN SMELL IT?

39:11.180 --> 39:12.147
[sniffing]

39:12.180 --> 39:14.000
ALL OVER
DELBECCHIO'S HANDS.

39:14.050 --> 39:15.017
SMELL WHAT?

39:15.050 --> 39:16.540
WHO SMELLS GINGER BLOSSOMS?

39:16.580 --> 39:17.615
I DO.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.083
(Shawn)
IT'S UNMISTAKABLE.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.542
IT'S HAIR GEL.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.558
KANGAROO PASTE.

39:22.590 --> 39:23.614
TRUST ME,

39:23.660 --> 39:24.854
IF YOU SWAB
DELBECCHIO'S HANDS

39:24.890 --> 39:28.428
AND COLE'S HAIR, YOU'LL SEE
THAT HE WAS THERE.

39:28.460 --> 39:29.996
PSYCHIC BULLCRAP.

39:30.030 --> 39:31.895
HUH?
DO YOU HAVE AN ALIBI?

39:31.930 --> 39:33.591
I DON'T NEED AN ALIBI,
I'M NOT GUILTY.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.393
OH, WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.668
'CAUSE WE CAN JUST LOOK
AT THE SECURITY CAMERAS

39:36.700 --> 39:37.689
FROM THE PARKING GARAGE.

39:37.740 --> 39:40.436
THERE WERE NO CAMERAS
IN THAT PARKING GARA...

39:40.470 --> 39:41.937
(both)
OOH.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.642
CUFF HIM, DETECTIVE O'HARA.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.704
GOT SOME QUESTIONS
FOR YOU

39:45.750 --> 39:46.899
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM.

39:46.950 --> 39:48.076
I, UH...

39:48.110 --> 39:50.476
GUESS THAT TAKES CARE
OF EVERYBODY.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.010
OKAY, TANCANA,
YOU MAY HAVE

39:52.050 --> 39:53.085
BEATEN THE MURDER RAP,

39:53.120 --> 39:54.553
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
DO SOME TIME

39:54.590 --> 39:56.717
FOR THAT ROBBERY
AND THAT ESCAPE.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.455
WELL, ROBBERY OVER MURDER,
THAT'S BETTER, RIGHT?

39:58.490 --> 39:59.957
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS,
PALS NOW?

39:59.990 --> 40:01.594
I'M SORRY TO BREAK UP
THIS TENDER MOMENT,

40:01.630 --> 40:02.949
BUT DON'T THINK
I'M NOT GONNA BE

40:03.000 --> 40:04.661
REALLY LOOKING CLOSELY
INTO THE CRAP

40:04.700 --> 40:06.565
YOU TWO MUST HAVE PULLED
IN THE LAST 14 HOURS.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.659
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU REPRIMAND US,

40:08.700 --> 40:10.588
YOU MIGHT TRY USING
YOUR FEELING VOICE.

40:10.640 --> 40:11.664
(Gus)
YEAH.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.166
OTHERWISE, ALL WE HEAR IS...

40:13.210 --> 40:15.735
[growling noises]

40:15.780 --> 40:17.008
THE VEST LOOKS GOOD.

40:17.040 --> 40:20.043
(Lassiter)
SHUT UP.

40:30.490 --> 40:31.957
SHAWN.

40:31.990 --> 40:34.823
LOOK, I REALLY
SCREWED UP TODAY.

40:34.860 --> 40:36.794
AND I JUST WANNA SAY
THANK YOU

40:36.830 --> 40:37.899
FOR BEING THERE FOR ME.

40:37.930 --> 40:38.919
IT REALLY MEANT A LOT.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.530
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

40:41.570 --> 40:45.506
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.565
YEAH.

40:47.610 --> 40:49.828
WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.872
WELL, I GUESS
YOU HAVE TO GET HOME

40:52.910 --> 40:55.140
AND FEED YOUR PARROT.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.841
SHAWN, I DON'T HAVE A PARROT.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.940
WELL, IN THAT CASE...

41:02.120 --> 41:03.587
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:03.620 --> 41:04.621
NOTHING.

41:04.660 --> 41:05.524
REALLY?

41:05.560 --> 41:06.481
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE DOING
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

41:06.530 --> 41:08.054
YOU'RE DOING, IT'S GONNA
BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS

41:08.090 --> 41:09.091
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.

41:09.130 --> 41:10.893
WHAT'S THAT?
A MISTAKE.

41:10.930 --> 41:14.491
I AGREE, BUT THAT'S
CLEARLY NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.496
OKAY.
REALLY?

41:16.540 --> 41:17.791
WHAT DO YOU SAY
THAT WE'RE DOING?

41:17.840 --> 41:21.207
I CALL IT
VERY CLOSE TALKING.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.698
AH, I SEE.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.548
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
TO SAY?

41:27.580 --> 41:32.586
MM...

41:32.620 --> 41:33.746
NO.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.849
I THINK I'M GOOD FOR NOW.

41:35.890 --> 41:38.108
OKAY.

41:41.330 --> 41:42.627
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

41:42.660 --> 41:44.025
