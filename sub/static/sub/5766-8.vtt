WEBVTT

00:01.660 --> 00:05.767
Previously on The Good Wife...
Look, you're right.
I don't have a plan.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.439
Let's just drop this. Okay?
ALICIA:
He told me to drop it.

00:08.470 --> 00:11.064
Anything said in
voicemail doesn't count.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.078
No. You know what?
I'm not just dropping this.

00:13.110 --> 00:15.328
You want to know my plan?
My plan is I love you.

00:15.380 --> 00:19.214
WILL:
Okay? If none of this makes
sense to you, just ignore it.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.687
I need something on
a Dr. Randall Booth.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.153
We need to knee-cap him.

00:27.190 --> 00:29.351
Anything you want, Mr. Gardner.

00:30.460 --> 00:33.725
(phone ringing)

00:33.760 --> 00:35.421
MAN (on recording):
Hello.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.690
MAN 2 (on recording):
Hey, Alderman. It's me.

00:37.730 --> 00:40.198
I'm-- hey, what is that?
You having a party?

00:40.240 --> 00:43.164
MAN 1: Yeah. My, uh, daughter's
preschool graduation.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.337
Is this, um...
this is about the cash?

00:45.370 --> 00:48.339
MAN 2:
Yeah, yeah. The $50,000.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.178
So, what? Do they have preschool
graduations these days?

00:51.210 --> 00:53.110
WADE: Preschool, grade school,
Sunday school;

00:53.150 --> 00:55.675
we celebrate every second
of a kid's life these days.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.258
CROMBIE: Yeah, Lindsey wants to
have a kid, but I don't know.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.178
TAP TECH (on recording):
2518 minimization.

01:01.220 --> 01:03.586
A "2518 minimization" is a

01:03.630 --> 01:05.586
30-second break
in the recording.

01:05.630 --> 01:09.760
required by law for when a phone
conversation turns personal.

01:09.800 --> 01:14.134
You're probably wondering why
we're asking you to indict

01:14.170 --> 01:15.728
only one of these men today.

01:15.770 --> 01:18.762
The simple reason is:

01:18.810 --> 01:20.675
this man is dead.

01:20.710 --> 01:23.747
Royce Crombie was a bundler.

01:23.780 --> 01:26.544
A man who solicited
money for politICIans.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.116
When Mr. Crombie found out

01:28.150 --> 01:30.789
that this grand jury
had been impaneled,

01:30.820 --> 01:31.844
he took his own life.

01:31.890 --> 01:36.759
So we are asking you
to focus on this man today.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.781
Matthew Wade.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.618
Now, I know many of you
may recognize him.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.468
Detroit Pistons, 2000?

01:45.500 --> 01:48.867
But I still need you to judge
him purely as a politician.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.869
A corrupt politician.

01:51.910 --> 01:53.229
WADE:
Dang, man.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.704
I thought you were
supposed to distract me.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.876
This is distracting you.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.775
What, distracting me with fouls?

01:59.820 --> 02:02.539
You got to protect those
knees, old man. For Marion.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.380
(wolf whistle)

02:06.420 --> 02:07.489
Looking good.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.385
Who's that?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.386
Tammy.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.897
Now, now.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.420
Aw!

02:18.500 --> 02:20.866
So, you really were done, huh?

02:20.900 --> 02:22.902
Moved on from
your schoolyard crush.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.237
How'd you meet her?

02:24.270 --> 02:25.862
She's an old friend.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.731
I told her to come down here
to watch me whip the ass

02:28.780 --> 02:30.702
of the great Matthew Wade.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.849
(cell phone ringing)

02:35.880 --> 02:37.609
WADE:
Here we go.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.649
How'd we do?

02:43.690 --> 02:46.591
Nothing yet. We're hearing
they may come back tomorrow.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.825
Tomorrow? You're kidding.
ALICIA: No.

02:48.860 --> 02:52.432
Kalinda thinks she can find out
more when the clerk comes out.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.438
Okay. Keep me in the loop.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.836
How is he?

02:56.870 --> 02:58.531
He's better than I'd be.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.800
You're a good friend,
hanging with him.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.944
No, in Chicago you need
your friends three times:

03:02.980 --> 03:05.847
At your wedding, your wake,
and your first indictment.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.849
Blake's here. Just arrived.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.949
Good. Have him help Kalinda.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.617
Yeah... Actually, I don't know

03:11.650 --> 03:13.982
how much those two
help each other.
Look, as long as they

03:14.020 --> 03:17.251
don't kill each other, the
competition's good for the firm.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.892
Dr. Booth is, uh,
still in the hospital.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.869
Sorry. That's the witness
that you put in a coma.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.538
Oh! Yeah.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.368
Yeah, what... when did
I do that, again?

03:32.410 --> 03:34.002
When you broke into his office

03:34.040 --> 03:36.543
to find evidence for our
anti-depressant case

03:36.580 --> 03:37.808
and the good doctor
surprised you?

03:37.850 --> 03:38.976
Right.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.843
Right. That must've
slipped my mind.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.815
'Cause I-I thought
I broke into his office,

03:44.850 --> 03:47.557
I found the evidence, I
accidentally left the door open,

03:47.590 --> 03:50.320
and then some unknown
assailant beat hIm up.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.625
_Sure. When the
police question you...

03:53.660 --> 03:55.321
stick to that.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.398
See you.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.964
Clerk just left the room.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.433
Kalinda's on him.

04:02.470 --> 04:04.700
Good. We'll sit tight.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.637
Nice guy.
Mm-hmm.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.309
I saw him at UCLA in '97.
Played like a demon.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.978
Sorry, hon. Looks like I won't
know for another day.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.988
So did he do it?

04:17.020 --> 04:18.988
Do what?

04:19.020 --> 04:21.318
Whatever they're
charging him with.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.989
He's a black Muslim alderman
In the crty's poorest ward.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.590
And he was wiretapped
saying I don't know what.

04:27.630 --> 04:30.326
My guess is it doesn't
matter if he did it.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.998
Music's off and he's
the one without a chair.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.996
_ You're not_interested
In any of this, are you?

04:35.040 --> 04:37.429
I'm sorry, were you talking?

04:37.470 --> 04:41.429
I have a surprise for
you tomorrow at work.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.879
Sounds dirty.

04:42.910 --> 04:43.877
What is it?

04:43.910 --> 04:45.946
Let me explain this whole
idea of "a surprise."

04:49.050 --> 04:51.848
If you fall in love
with me, I'm out of here.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.357
I know.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.017
I'm just warning you.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.789
I know.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.889
WADE:
Will!

04:58.930 --> 05:00.921
Call waiting.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.758
The problem isn't corruption;
the problem is terrorism.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.960
What?

05:05.000 --> 05:05.989
They say he took

05:06.030 --> 05:09.761
extremist money.
30 years to life.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.438
I need you to take this.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.698
I heard. It's just
federal overreach.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.378
I know, but they may have

05:16.410 --> 05:19.299
stumbled onto something
they can win-- anti-Muslim bias.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.913
Wiretaps are hard.
Juries love them.

05:22.950 --> 05:25.441
I know. That's why
I need you to take this.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.913
_ Get it kicke_d
In pretrIal motIons.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.928
He will lose in front of a jury.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.928
And if I advise him
to cop a plea?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.991
It's your call.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.719
DIANE:
Okay, very simply:

05:37.770 --> 05:40.967
the government was embarrassed
by the Blagojevich fiasco,

05:41.000 --> 05:41.932
and they're gunning for any

05:41.970 --> 05:43.904
Chicago politician
they can find.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.532
Will has nothing
to do with this.

05:45.570 --> 05:46.798
He has asked me to lead

05:46.840 --> 05:48.808
because his friendship
with Wade is a hindrance.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.102
So here's our plan.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.574
Get the terrorism charge
booted. We do that,

05:53.620 --> 05:56.043
we get a 30-year sentence
down to six months and change.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.012
Two fronts: the money.

05:57.050 --> 05:59.689
I'm going through Royce
Crombie's finances.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.756
He bundled for
a lot of candidates.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.950
I'm trying to trace the cash.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.651
Good. Take Blake.

06:04.690 --> 06:06.555
And the second front,
the wiretaps.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.056
Already worked out
discovery with the Feds.

06:08.100 --> 06:08.828
The usual rules.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.999
We go to them,
work in their house.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.066
How many hours of tapes?
135.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.089
(whistles)

06:14.140 --> 06:15.129
How many people do you need?

06:15.170 --> 06:17.832
Michael, Howard, Alan,

06:17.870 --> 06:19.804
Alicia.
Should take a week.
Good.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.899
There's something in those
tapes the government believes

06:21.940 --> 06:22.872
makes their terrorism case.

06:22.910 --> 06:26.744
Is it an inaudible utterance?
Is It guesswork?

06:26.780 --> 06:30.011
Find it. Neutralize it.
When do you go?

06:30.050 --> 06:31.449
As soon as this meeting is over.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.616
Good. It's over.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.082
JULIUS:
No pens, no papers,

06:38.130 --> 06:39.927
no cells.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.996
The tapes won't be marked,
the calls won't be labeled.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.919
They make our jobs hard because
we are out to destroy them.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.097
You brought jackets. Good.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.596
The Feds keep the room
temperatures freezing.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.062
It's petty harassment,
but don't complain.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.102
Don't bitch. Just work harder.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.029
Don't say anything
to anyone but me.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.044
(scanner beeping)

07:08.060 --> 07:11.928
Don't forget. You find anything,
knock on my door.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.129
(beeping)

08:06.010 --> 08:10.549
TAP TECH (on recording):
2/22/10, 11:38 am.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.912
(beep, phone rings)

08:13.960 --> 08:15.154
WADE:
Hello?

08:15.190 --> 08:16.157
MAN (muffled):
Wade, it's me. You phoned?

08:16.190 --> 08:18.158
WADE:
Uh, yeah. Where you at?
(gasps): Oh!

08:18.190 --> 08:19.157
MAN:
The office. What's up?

08:19.190 --> 08:23.297
WADE: You sound busy.
I thought we could talk.

08:23.330 --> 08:26.219
MAN: So, what? Are we in need
of advice or consultation?

08:26.270 --> 08:29.194
WADE:
A bit of both. When does the
meter start running, Eli?

08:29.240 --> 08:30.867
(gasps)

08:32.210 --> 08:34.576
(disc scanning back)

08:34.610 --> 08:36.771
WADE: When does the meter
start runnIng, ElI?

08:36.810 --> 08:39.040
ELI (chuckles): For a friend,
when we both agree.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.880
I got a meeting with Florrick
in ten, so what do you need?

08:42.920 --> 08:45.889
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

09:04.340 --> 09:07.332
BECCA:
That's just pitiful. 57 friends.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.201
The only thing worse
than having a fake profile

09:10.250 --> 09:11.342
is having nobody visit it.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.972
We just need to update it.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.170
He needs _to comment more
on hIs dad's race.

09:15.220 --> 09:20.658
No. He needs to comment
more on hIs opponent's race.

09:21.190 --> 09:22.828
What?

09:22.860 --> 09:26.694
We have Glenn Childs, Jr.
say something... racist

09:26.730 --> 09:27.992
about his dad's
African-American opponent.

09:28.030 --> 09:29.827
It wouldn't be us
saying it. It'd be him.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.758
Yeah, but it'll be us
having him say it.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.995
And besides, it'll just
make Wendy look sympathetic.

09:34.040 --> 09:38.966
So, what then?
We need something viral.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.838
ZACH:
Oh, my God. Dad. Dad, look!

09:43.880 --> 09:45.700
It's a double rainbow!

09:45.750 --> 09:48.776
Dad, get out of
your sleeping bag.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.344
Tell me, Dad.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.687
What does it mean?

09:51.720 --> 09:54.689
It means the city is safe.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.654
(crowd cheering)

09:56.690 --> 09:58.226
(laughing)

09:58.260 --> 09:59.852
WILL: So, why do you need
the blinds closed, again?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.253
TAMMY: _
For your surprIse.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.298
It's not my birthday.

10:09.770 --> 10:10.862
You see the puppy?

10:10.910 --> 10:11.934
I do.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.369
The puppy's smiling.

10:13.410 --> 10:14.707
I can see.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.309
No...

10:23.420 --> 10:25.980
(chuckles)

10:26.020 --> 10:27.988
Where?

10:28.020 --> 10:29.419
50-yard line.

10:29.460 --> 10:30.722
How?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.751
Magic.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.893
I got to admit, this is
really turning me on.

10:34.930 --> 10:38.798
I knew it would.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.695
How much time do we have?

10:40.740 --> 10:42.799
20 minutes.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.942
(clattering)

10:52.820 --> 10:54.811
(muffled conversation)

10:59.120 --> 11:01.281
DIANE:
We're not alone.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.288
Sorry. I...

11:03.330 --> 11:04.752
That's okay.

11:04.790 --> 11:05.722
Something on
the wiretaps.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.692
What is it?

11:06.730 --> 11:08.357
Someone who's on them.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.265
Eli Gold.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.188
Well, I guess
that would make sense.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.892
Wade would be phoning
a political operative like Eli.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.204
Well, that's what I
thought at first, too.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.935
But the wiretaps
are on Eli's phone.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.999
You think the Feds
are going after him?

11:24.050 --> 11:26.177
Six degrees of wiretap.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.417
The Feds go from
Crombie to Wade,

11:28.450 --> 11:30.748
Wade to Eli, then Eli to...

11:34.390 --> 11:35.812
Uh, thank you, Alicia.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.384
E" is a top client,

11:37.430 --> 11:39.853
but I think you can't say
anything to him.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.027
I know it'll be difficult,

11:42.060 --> 11:44.028
but you're covered by
the same confidentiality.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.026
Do you want off
the wiretap detail?

11:46.070 --> 11:47.492
No.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.360
Unless you want me off.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.937
No. You're doing a good job.

11:51.970 --> 11:54.768
So anything on
the terrorism charge?

11:54.810 --> 11:57.870
Well, we now know why
the grand jury indicted.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.047
Wade comes right
out and says it.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.380
"Is the $50,000 political payoff
from Islamic extremists?"

12:03.420 --> 12:05.888
He actually says
"Islamic extremists"?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.456
Wade says he was joking.

12:07.490 --> 12:08.514
Yes, but it doesn't sound good.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.118
All right, stay on it.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.787
Thank you, Alicia.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.024
Your client
killed a man.

12:13.060 --> 12:14.459
And in Chicago, at least
today, that's illegal.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.127
And I'm not gonna cut
any corners with you,

12:16.160 --> 12:17.764
so get it to
me by 5:00.

12:17.800 --> 12:18.824
You sound tough.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.132
Yeah, I'm in
a bad mood.

12:20.170 --> 12:21.262
What do you need?

12:21.300 --> 12:24.463
The Crombie suicide-- I need
his movements the last week.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.398
Oh, yeah, the bundler?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.532
Shouldn't you be
in federal court?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.902
I thought Cook County probably
did its own investigation.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.178
Come with me.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.471
No, you can just
send it over.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.012
Kalinda,
come with me.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.518
Okay.

12:47.860 --> 12:50.169
Wow, you really are
in a bad mood.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.191
What's up?

12:55.970 --> 12:57.335
(sighs)

12:57.370 --> 12:59.099
Dr. Randall Booth.

12:59.140 --> 13:02.439
Do you know
who that is?

13:02.480 --> 13:03.970
I do.

13:04.010 --> 13:07.070
Thank you for not lying to me.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.089
Well, thank you for having
so much faith in me.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.348
He was beaten

13:11.390 --> 13:13.415
within an inch of his life

13:13.460 --> 13:17.089
after surprising a burglar
ransacking his office.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.258
Strangely enough, your firm
won a case the next day

13:20.300 --> 13:22.120
that benefited
from that assault.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.593
Are you making an accusation?

13:23.630 --> 13:26.167
No.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.339
I saw the assault report,

13:28.370 --> 13:30.838
and your fingerprints
were found at the scene.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.870
What?

13:34.910 --> 13:37.606
Now, I told the investigators
what I thought.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.448
I thought you probably
went to the doctor's office

13:40.480 --> 13:42.619
earlier in the day
to question him,

13:42.650 --> 13:44.948
and that's how your fingerprints
ended up there.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.448
And the police--
they wanted to question you.

13:48.490 --> 13:52.995
I told them this_sort of assault
was unIIke you

13:53.030 --> 13:56.898
and suggested
they look elsewhere.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.039
Thanks.

14:02.070 --> 14:06.200
But if I were you, Kalinda,
I would try and figure out

14:06.240 --> 14:09.004
how my fingerprints
ended up at the scene.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.212
What did the assailant use?

14:13.250 --> 14:14.478
To beat the doctor?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.714
Yeah.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.844
Never recovered, but the police
think it was a baseball bat.

14:25.530 --> 14:26.588
(car alarm chirps)

14:36.970 --> 14:39.666
WADE (recording): I was elected
by a five-point margin.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.302
ELI:
In Ward 53.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.104
I could get a serial killer
elected in Ward 53.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.175
(chuckles):
Okay, I got to go. Um...

14:46.210 --> 14:48.917
I'll help ifI can, but my hands
are full with Florrick.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.019

14:54.320 --> 14:55.480
ELI:
This is Gold.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.420
MARISSA:
Yeah, Dad, it's me.

14:57.460 --> 14:59.121
ELI: Yeah, your mom
said you'd phone.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.321
MARISSA:
Did she tell you?
She told me a strange story

15:01.360 --> 15:04.022
about you wanting to move to
Israel and live on a kibbutz.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.561
MARISSA:
It's not strange, Dad.
I'm 18. I want to go.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.932
ELI: Yeah, of course, you want
to go, but you're...

15:08.970 --> 15:12.508
TAP TECH:
2518 minimization-- 11:17 am.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.576
30-second break. Tap resumed.

15:14.610 --> 15:15.838
MAN:
Hey, Alderman Wade.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.405
Hoping you could help us with
that new detox center down on...

15:18.450 --> 15:21.715
WOMAN:
This is Gwen Abernathy, from the
Central City No Kill Shelter.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.217
I have a bit of a problem...

15:23.250 --> 15:24.615
MAN 2: ...trying to schedule an
appointment

15:24.650 --> 15:26.186
to come talk to
the high school...

15:26.220 --> 15:27.482
ELI:
No, no, don't tell Peter.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.589
MOODY:
Why not?

15:28.620 --> 15:30.258
ELI:
It's a detail; he hates details.

15:30.290 --> 15:31.723
I'll ask Alicia.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.694
MOODY:
What's up with you, Eli?

15:33.730 --> 15:36.119
Everything you do, you shoot
past the candidate's wife?!

15:36.160 --> 15:37.229
ELI:
No, I don't.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.623
MOODY:
Yeah, you do.

15:38.670 --> 15:41.093
ELI:
Okay, I do. She's smart.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.700
She's not like-- uh,
what was that one in 2008?

15:43.740 --> 15:45.537
MOODY:
Oh, my God, Jenny.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.709
Yeah. (chuckles)

15:47.740 --> 15:50.106
So does she know
everything you're up to?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.277
ELI:
Alicia? Uh, no.

15:52.310 --> 15:53.618
MOODY:
You gonna tell her?

15:53.650 --> 15:54.719
ELI:
I don't know, um...

15:54.750 --> 15:57.218
She's burdened with a--
what do you call that thing?

15:57.250 --> 15:59.081
A conscience.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.054
MOODY:
Oh, yeah, that.
Yeah, that.

16:01.090 --> 16:01.909
(cell phone ringing)

16:01.960 --> 16:04.121
What's up, Martin?
I'm kind of busy.

16:04.160 --> 16:04.785
What did we say?

16:04.830 --> 16:06.286
What the hell
did we say?!

16:06.330 --> 16:07.729
Is this about the debates?

16:07.760 --> 16:10.126
No, Glenn Childs cannot
stand on a soap box.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.161
You know what this is about.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.088
You're right, but remind me.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.461
We said hands off families.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.104
Florrick has two kids.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.300
My client has two kids.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.477
They were off-limits.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.068
They are off-limits.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.577
Then what am I looking at?

16:23.610 --> 16:24.770
Tell me.
I need guidance.

16:24.810 --> 16:26.539
A fake Web profile.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.013
A "double rainbow" video

16:28.050 --> 16:29.210
of someone faking
Glenn, Jr.'s voice.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.444
Sounds sweet.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.709
It has Childs and his son in
the same sleeping bag together.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.059
Google "Double rainbow"
and "Glenn Childs, Jr."

16:39.090 --> 16:39.784
(typing)

16:39.830 --> 16:41.149
Doesn't sound like us, Martin.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.349
Have you checked out Wendy?

16:42.400 --> 16:43.196
Oh, come on.

16:43.230 --> 16:45.391
Eli, that only works
so many times.

16:45.430 --> 16:47.660
You know, we have stuff
we can use, too.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.588
Stuff on Zach and Grace.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.063
That's right,
I know their names.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.078
ZACH (over computer):
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful!

16:54.110 --> 16:55.600
Don't do anything
you'd regret, Martin.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.732
Or what?

16:56.780 --> 16:59.408
My only regret is thinking
you'd stick to your word.

16:59.450 --> 17:02.044
You want to make this
about families,

17:02.080 --> 17:04.082
this is now about families.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.338
ZACH: Oh, Dad, Dad, get out of
your sleeping bag...

17:06.390 --> 17:08.051
I don't know, Eli.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.057
But it's not us.

17:09.090 --> 17:11.251
Let me comfort you, son.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.099
(kissing)

17:13.130 --> 17:15.155
CROMBIE (over recording):
Hey, Alderman. Got a moment?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.258
WADE:
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.699
It's only 5:00 am.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.129
CROMBIE:
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.694
Did I wake you?

17:20.740 --> 17:21.798
WADE:
How much, Royce?

17:21.840 --> 17:22.795
CROMBIE:
$30,000.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.502
WADE: So are we talking
Islamic extremists here?

17:25.540 --> 17:27.531
(both laugh)

17:31.680 --> 17:34.114
So are we talking
Islamic extremists here?

17:34.150 --> 17:35.515
(both laugh)

17:35.550 --> 17:36.847
ALICIA:
It was a joke.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.313
They were laughing.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.113
I got the original.

17:40.160 --> 17:45.086
"4/23/10. 5:33 am."

17:45.130 --> 17:47.291
That's my call-waiting.

17:47.330 --> 17:50.322
Good. I'll see you in court.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.826
Hello.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.861
Hey, Alicia, we've got
a bit of a problem.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.733
Mr. Gold-- Eli, how are you?

17:56.770 --> 17:58.306
Good.

17:58.340 --> 17:59.329
Why?

17:59.370 --> 18:00.803
No reason.

18:00.840 --> 18:01.670
Okay.

18:01.710 --> 18:03.803
So I got a call
from the Childs campaign

18:03.850 --> 18:05.249
about something on the Internet

18:05.280 --> 18:07.271
that we did not approve.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.888
Alicia?

18:11.920 --> 18:14.480
Eli, um, why don't we
do this in person?

18:14.520 --> 18:16.715
In p...?
It'll only take a second.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.126
Um, you know what,
we can do it after court.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.491
Um, we'll do it in person...

18:20.530 --> 18:21.497
What's going on?

18:21.530 --> 18:23.225
We'll talk later.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.334
BAILIFF:
All rise. The Honorable
Judge Lessner presiding.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.235
And we have pretrial motions

18:32.340 --> 18:33.238
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.872
Oh, hell.

18:34.910 --> 18:36.468
Ms. Lockhart, do
you have a motion?

18:36.510 --> 18:37.499
(whispers):
Diane, psst.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.505
Diane, Diane.

18:38.550 --> 18:39.642
Uh, one moment, Your Honor.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.480
Just keep saying
"in my opinion"

18:44.520 --> 18:46.488
before everything.
Keep what?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.385
I've argued in front of
this judge before. Just do it.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.819
Ms. Lockhart?

18:49.860 --> 18:53.648
Um, yes, Your Honor, I, um...

18:53.700 --> 18:56.555
We believe the government
has padded its charge

18:56.600 --> 19:00.161
against my client with
a ridiculous terrorism count...

19:00.200 --> 19:01.565
in my opinion.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.433
And we ask for summary dismissal
of this charge.

19:04.470 --> 19:07.473
The government has ample reason
to charge Mr. Wade, Your Honor.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.307
In the submitted wiretaps,
he had mentioned

19:09.340 --> 19:12.901
on several occasions receiving
money from Muslim extremists.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.269
In your opinion?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.413
Excuse me, Your Honor?

19:16.450 --> 19:18.714
In your opinion, you
have ample reason?

19:18.750 --> 19:22.686
Uh, yes, in my opinion.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.358
The unfortunate thing
is, Your Honor,

19:24.390 --> 19:26.278
the government has
attempted to bury the fact

19:26.330 --> 19:28.423
that this was merely a
joke-- in my opinion.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.725
A joke taken deathly seriously
by their client.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.692
I'm sorry,
was that in your opinion?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.693
Ms. Vashey, was it?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.278
Yes, Your Honor.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.277
In my opinion.

19:42.310 --> 19:43.607
DIANE:
The only problem
is that,

19:43.650 --> 19:45.379
in an earlier _
taped conversatIon

19:45.410 --> 19:47.617
between Mr. Wade
and Royce Crombie,

19:47.650 --> 19:50.517
the two men discussed
Mr. Wade's faith

19:50.550 --> 19:53.713
and joked that the only people
who would contribute money

19:53.760 --> 19:55.682
to him were Islamic extremists.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.859
This then became
their running gag.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.688
A running gag unaccompanied
by laughter, Your Honor.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.618
Yes, as tends to happen
in human conversation.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.627
You'll find,

20:03.670 --> 20:05.922
at these moments
In the WIretaps,

20:05.970 --> 20:07.460
Mr. Wade and Crombie joked--

20:07.500 --> 20:09.559
with laughter--

20:09.600 --> 20:10.908
about Muslim extremists.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.637
In my opinion.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.329
It does seem
a little odd,

20:15.380 --> 20:19.339
Ms. Vashey, that someone who was
an actual Muslim extremist

20:19.380 --> 20:21.974
would refer to associates
as "Mus|Im extremIsts."

20:22.020 --> 20:24.511
Do you have
anything else?

20:26.850 --> 20:30.251
Ms. Vashey,
anything?

20:30.290 --> 20:31.188
Your Honor,

20:31.230 --> 20:35.621
immediately after
Mr. Wade received $50,000

20:35.660 --> 20:38.322
from an Islamic
extremIst contrIbutor,

20:38.370 --> 20:40.338
_ he vetoed _ _
the CIty counCIl's deCISIOn

20:40.370 --> 20:42.793
and insisted that
the Al-Mirad mosque be built...

20:42.840 --> 20:43.807
Oh, come on.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.661
This he did
over the objections

20:46.710 --> 20:49.270
of his community and the advice
of his campaign manager--

20:49.310 --> 20:50.709
in my opinion.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.445
This is a moving target
of an indictment, Your Honor.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.641
In my opinion,
it should be rejected.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.977
The evidence is quite clear.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.339
In my opinion.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.641
Then supply it
to the defense

20:58.690 --> 21:00.817
for review,
and I will hear arguments

21:00.860 --> 21:02.782
on this charge in
four days time.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.784
They're going to get
me, no matter what.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.598
Alderman Wade did, in fact,
maneuver the city council

21:16.640 --> 21:20.007
to approve
the Al-Mirad mosque on 86th.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.678
And he
explained why.

21:21.710 --> 21:22.779
He did.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.471
It was a blighted neighborhood,

21:24.510 --> 21:26.068
and the building
that was razed was

21:26.110 --> 21:27.748
a squatters'
meth house.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.748
_ It's also true that the _
neIghborhood has reVIved smce,

21:29.780 --> 21:32.783
so one could argue that Wade
made the right decision.

21:32.820 --> 21:33.912
But?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.087
He received a payment
from Crombie--

21:36.120 --> 21:40.352
a $50,000 contribution--
a day before he reversed himself

21:40.400 --> 21:42.459
on the mosque.
It's a bad fact.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.967
Yep.

21:44.000 --> 21:44.967
Anything good?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.865
Well, there's, um...

21:48.600 --> 21:49.862
...something odd.

21:51.540 --> 21:52.802
Um, the bundler, Crombie--

21:52.840 --> 21:56.037
at the time of this
$50,000 contribution,

21:56.080 --> 21:58.878
_ he made six visits
In one week to the same

21:58.910 --> 22:00.810
gas station at
Garfield Park.

22:00.850 --> 22:02.818
Okay, I don't
understand.

22:02.850 --> 22:04.715
This gas station is
ten miles away from him.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.718
JULIUS:
You think it was
a meeting place

22:06.750 --> 22:08.718
for one of these
Islamic contributors?

22:08.760 --> 22:09.886
Or a non-Islamic one.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.956
I will...
I will find out.

22:11.990 --> 22:14.026
And we're still
on the WIre taps.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.755
Halfway through.
Good. Then let's go.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.724
Everything all right?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.428
Yeah. It will be soon.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.472
So what'd you do
with my bat?

22:30.880 --> 22:31.972
I took it

22:32.010 --> 22:35.571
because I didn't want you to
destroy my next rental car.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.918
Right. So where is it?

22:37.950 --> 22:39.918
You know what I want, Kalinda?

22:41.190 --> 22:43.055
A truce.

22:43.090 --> 22:47.629
Because I really think that
we got off on the wrong foot.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.926
This won't end well.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.064
Well, that's intimidating.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.738
JULIUS: The 15 boxes
we've been through

22:57.770 --> 22:58.930
haven't yielded
anything bullet-proof,

22:58.970 --> 23:02.736
so we need to focus on repeated
patterns of conversa...

23:19.060 --> 23:20.721
Eli.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.523
How are you?

23:22.560 --> 23:24.767
Me? Good.
Why? What's wrong?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.995
Nothing.
I was just asking.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.692
There is a tape online
which we had nothing to do with

23:29.740 --> 23:31.560
making fun
of Glenn Childs's son.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.636
And Ijust had an angry call
from the Childs campaign

23:34.680 --> 23:36.739
that they plan
to return the favor.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.543
Return? What
do you mean?

23:38.580 --> 23:40.616
I don't know. But
I wanted to prepare you.

23:40.650 --> 23:41.969
(cell phone rings)
Hold on.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.785
Hello?

23:45.820 --> 23:47.811
Yeah?

23:47.860 --> 23:49.782
Well, stop him!

23:49.820 --> 23:51.549
What do you
want me to do?!

23:51.590 --> 23:54.127
Tough campaign?

23:54.160 --> 23:56.890
We get the Pastor Isaiah
endorsement right at the moment

23:56.930 --> 23:58.864
when it means nothing
because he loses his church.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.834
So, yeah. I guess.

24:00.870 --> 24:03.907
You're doing everything
by the book, aren't you?

24:03.940 --> 24:05.999
(cell phone rings)

24:06.040 --> 24:08.031
Hello?

24:15.950 --> 24:18.839
*

24:35.900 --> 24:38.607
So, uh, Lemond Bishop
owns this place, right?

24:41.980 --> 24:44.540
I recognize you
from his crew.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.549
I did some work for
Mr. Bishop last year.

24:47.580 --> 24:49.719
Okay, I know
he's legit now.

24:49.750 --> 24:50.887
No more drugs.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.945
(sighs)
Here's your change.

24:55.090 --> 24:58.526
So, uh... if Mr. Bishop
happens to come in here,

24:58.560 --> 25:00.790
will you tell him that
Kalinda dropped by,

25:00.830 --> 25:03.025
wanted to talk to him
about Alderman Wade?

25:03.060 --> 25:05.096
He's not the owner, lady.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.837
I'm just
across the street.

25:07.870 --> 25:08.939
Parked right there.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.000
I don't think
you're hearing me.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.075
He's not the owner.

25:14.110 --> 25:17.034
You have a nice day.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.782
Stop it.

25:25.820 --> 25:27.185
You still mad at me?

25:27.220 --> 25:29.279
I'm just
studying, see?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.026
This is called studying.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.721
Well, I'm bored.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.024
Well, you need to work
on that, don't you?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.732
How much would it cost?

25:42.770 --> 25:45.967
Ten dollars.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.035
My mom would kill me.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.969
Not if it was just one
sweet little stud.

25:51.010 --> 25:52.841
Right there.

26:01.990 --> 26:03.582
Who do you think
you are, Becca?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.359
I think you just answered
your question, didn't you?

26:05.390 --> 26:06.948
You think what you
did is funny?

26:06.990 --> 26:08.059
What are you talking about?
What did I do?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.193
The fake page you
made about me.
What fake page?

26:10.230 --> 26:13.222
I know you did it, you bitch.
I recognize the picture.

26:13.270 --> 26:14.931
What picture? What
are you talking about?

26:14.970 --> 26:16.039
The one from drama camp.

26:16.070 --> 26:18.061
What...?!
Who do you
think you are?

26:18.110 --> 26:20.260
Hey! Hey! She said
she didn't do it.

26:20.310 --> 26:22.801
Oh, I get it.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.148
The Florricks.
Oh, no.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.044
It's-It's okay.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.117
Glenn, stop it!

26:28.150 --> 26:31.039
(onlookers murmuring)

26:31.090 --> 26:32.079
Zach!

26:35.860 --> 26:37.987
BECCA: Don't worry,
you're still beautiful.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.282
He's such a jerk.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.389
Well, you were
very brave.

26:42.430 --> 26:45.069
No, I was just...

26:45.100 --> 26:47.989
Thanks for sticking up for me.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.028
I got to go.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.046
*

27:34.380 --> 27:36.871
Stay in.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.182
Mr. Bishop?

27:38.220 --> 27:40.040
Oh, yeah.

27:40.090 --> 27:41.182
Now I know you.

27:41.220 --> 27:43.051
Kalinda Sharma.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.183
Yeah, but your firm...

27:45.230 --> 27:47.084
I thought you guys
went bankrupt.

27:47.130 --> 27:49.724
Not yet, but we
are working on it.

27:49.760 --> 27:50.761
(laughing)

27:50.800 --> 27:53.166
You're working on it.

27:53.200 --> 27:57.068
So, what are we after here?

27:57.100 --> 27:58.965
Actually, uh,

27:59.010 --> 28:01.171
I work for
Alderman Wade.

28:01.210 --> 28:04.338
It would be really
helpful if we could prove

28:04.380 --> 28:06.143
that the donations
he recered

28:06.180 --> 28:09.047
came from someone other
than IslamIc extremIsts.

28:09.080 --> 28:13.039
Well,
I'm no Islamic extremist, lady.

28:13.090 --> 28:16.309
No. I-I didn't think
that you were, sir.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.921
It's just that the day
after Wade accepted

28:19.960 --> 28:21.291
the $50,000 donation,

28:21.330 --> 28:25.289
he made a 180-degree turn
on building a mosque.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.469
We just need to show that
the money's irrelevant.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.195
That's all.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.060
Well, I wish I could help you,

28:31.110 --> 28:33.135
but I like
to donate anonymously.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.104
You know, like Jesus said.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.028
"Do good deeds in private,

28:37.080 --> 28:39.776
so only your Heavenly Father
will reward you."

28:39.810 --> 28:43.177
Sure, but uh... we could
keep you anonymous.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.189
No. Thank you, though.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.859
This is what I need.

28:48.890 --> 28:52.280
I need you to stop asking
questions about my business.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.522
My apologies.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.790
Good luck with Wade.

28:57.830 --> 29:00.890
I hated the Pistons.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.135
But I always liked him.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.435
Wow.
(exhales)

29:30.030 --> 29:32.191
*

29:44.580 --> 29:47.105
Every year, Cook County police

29:47.150 --> 29:50.074
map out gang territories
according to crime statistics,

29:50.120 --> 29:52.839
arrests, and gang tags.

29:52.890 --> 29:55.017
This is a copy
of last year's map.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.858
This territory here,
according to police,

29:57.890 --> 29:59.221
belongs to Lemond Bishop.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.557
Our old friend, Bishop.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.392
And who's this here?

30:03.430 --> 30:05.489
This is Cobal Sixty.

30:05.530 --> 30:07.225
A competing gang.

30:07.270 --> 30:09.568
They ran a meth house from the
squatters' building here.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.568
That's the building
that was torn down,

30:11.610 --> 30:14.579
and the Al-Mirad mosque
was built in its place.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.100
Oh, my God.

30:16.140 --> 30:20.270
This is a copy
of this year's map.

30:20.310 --> 30:22.972
Lemond Bishop

30:23.020 --> 30:24.180
occupies it all.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.586
Alderman Wade wasn't
being paid off

30:26.620 --> 30:29.350
by Islamic extremists.
The mosque was irrelevant.

30:29.390 --> 30:31.529
He was being paid off
by Lemond Bishop

30:31.560 --> 30:34.051
to get rid of his
competition's base.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.126
What a defense.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.627
Wade wasn't working
for terrorists.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.989
He was working

30:40.030 --> 30:41.463
for a drug lord.

30:52.650 --> 30:55.141
You took the money.

30:55.180 --> 30:58.217
We found out you took the
$50,000 from a drug dealer.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.387
From a businessman.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.580
Come on.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.417
Lemond Bishop's
as much a businessman

31:02.460 --> 31:04.018
as I'm a point guard.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.652
You helped him
control territory.

31:05.690 --> 31:09.126
When did the rules get tougher
for black politicians?

31:09.160 --> 31:11.469
Of course I took a
campaIgn contrIbutIon.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.162
Of course I treated that
contributor like a friend.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.998
Oh my God. You're like a little
kid who gets his hand stuck

31:17.040 --> 31:19.133
in a cookie jar, starts yelling
about racial bias.

31:19.170 --> 31:22.037
No, I'm like a little kid
who had to wait in line

31:22.080 --> 31:24.344
for the white kids to get their
hands out of the cookie jar.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.644
Well, we're talking
a plea bargain now.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.910
We can get them
down to five years.

31:28.950 --> 31:30.042
No.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.947
Wade, our only defense is that
you're just as corrupt

31:32.990 --> 31:34.412
as any other politician
in this damn town.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.984
Then argue it!

31:36.020 --> 31:37.681
We have no options!

31:37.720 --> 31:39.153
We got two wars
in this country.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.327
Terrorism and drugs.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.966
You just went from one
enemy camp to another.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.525
I'm not taking a plea.

31:46.570 --> 31:47.992
Now...

31:48.040 --> 31:51.009
You gonna suit up?

31:52.610 --> 31:55.374
(ball bouncing)

31:57.380 --> 31:59.541
Oh, hello,
Mrs. Florrick.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.070
Yes?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.179
I'm Becca. I'm-I'm
visiting Zach.

32:03.220 --> 32:06.087
Zach, I think,
is still at school.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.317
Oh. Oh, wait.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.987
Oh. That's him.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.624
Um, he asked if
I could wait.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.025
He'll be right up.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.129
Well, may I?

32:17.730 --> 32:19.960
Certainly.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.037
I guess he had to
take Nisa home first.

32:23.070 --> 32:28.076
She's his... his girlfriend.

32:28.110 --> 32:29.634
So you're not...?

32:29.680 --> 32:31.102
(laughs)

32:31.150 --> 32:33.141
Zach's girlfriend?

32:33.180 --> 32:34.545
No.

32:34.580 --> 32:35.979
We're just study partners.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.443
I-I don't have time
for boyfriends.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.640
My dad says, "Get into
a good college first,

32:40.690 --> 32:42.009
"and then we can talk

32:42.060 --> 32:43.618
about boys."

32:43.660 --> 32:45.981
So you haven't met Nisa?

32:46.030 --> 32:47.657
No.

32:47.690 --> 32:50.625
Zach is a real sweetie
to make her feel at home.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.628
Her family's from Somalia,

32:52.670 --> 32:56.265
and I know how out of place
someone like that can feel here.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.502
No. He wants to go fonNard.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.371
With what?
With whatever we got.

33:01.410 --> 33:03.435
He _considers this a
raCIal prosecutIon.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.038
It is a racial prosecution,

33:05.080 --> 33:07.105
but it's_a racial
prosecutIon we're
gonna lose.

33:07.150 --> 33:09.471
We still have the wiretaps.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.112
There's a lot
of people on them.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.185
Campaign operatives.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.552
Politicians who seem
pretty saw about the cash.

33:14.590 --> 33:17.218
Show the hypocrisy
of the prosecution

33:17.260 --> 33:19.728
by naming the white participants
who are not being tagged.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.728
One of t_hem's
our c|Ient.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.318
VVho?

33:24.700 --> 33:27.260
Eli Gold.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.238
Well, it wouldn't be Chicago

33:31.270 --> 33:32.760
if there weren't
a conflict of interest.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.438
Okay, so let's finish
the taps,

33:35.480 --> 33:37.107
collect the names
of all the operatIves

33:37.140 --> 33:38.402
and politicians on them,
get our ducks in row,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.475
see what kind of brief
we can argue from it.

33:42.150 --> 33:45.586
How long have you known
E" was on the wiretap?

33:45.620 --> 33:46.587
A few days.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.281
_ We don't share
InformatIon anymore?

33:55.700 --> 33:57.759
WADE:
Well, could you have

33:57.800 --> 33:59.427
the mayor phone me back?
MAN (recording):
Of course, Alderman.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.199
I understand
how important this is,

34:01.240 --> 34:03.435
and of course you understand...

34:03.470 --> 34:05.233
Can you listen
to this?

34:05.270 --> 34:07.261
But I promise you...

34:09.110 --> 34:11.203
WADE (chuckles): Hey, no one
else works on a Sunday.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.707
WOMAN (laughs):
And what's up with you, Matthew?

34:13.750 --> 34:15.513
I heard you're running
into a little trouble.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.279
WADE:
Well, it's nothing
I can't handle.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.118
Just wondering
if you miss Chicago.

34:20.150 --> 34:22.186
WOMAN (laughing):
The restaurants.

34:22.220 --> 34:25.280
So I heard the machine's
falling apart.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.683
At least that's what I read.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.788
WADE:
Yeah, you guys all flee

34:27.830 --> 34:30.549
to the White House,
and we're left holding the bag.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.397
WOMAN (laughs):
Oh, come on, Wade.

34:32.430 --> 34:33.226
Who is it?

34:33.270 --> 34:36.762
Do you want me
to tell Obama that?

34:36.800 --> 34:38.404
Ruth Yamaguchi?

34:38.440 --> 34:41.238
The actual Ruth Yamaguchi?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.430
No, no, I'll get
the briefs together.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.243
You finish
the tapes.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.247
Good news?

34:46.280 --> 34:48.145
The best.

34:48.180 --> 34:52.412
Uh, I've asked
you here, Eli...

34:55.420 --> 34:58.253
...because I'm starting
a new firm with David Lee,

34:58.290 --> 35:01.748
and I want your business
to come with me.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.620
This move doesn't
seem lIke you.

35:03.660 --> 35:07.164
It's more like...
Will-- I know.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.462
I discovered Will
and Derrick Bond

35:08.500 --> 35:10.661
were thinking
of pushing me out,

35:10.700 --> 35:13.863
so this is me being proactive.

35:13.910 --> 35:15.468
This is happening when?

35:15.510 --> 35:18.479
Soon, in a few weeks,
which takes me

35:18.510 --> 35:22.378
to the second thing
that I have to ask of you.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.809
I need you to keep this
conﬁdenﬁal

35:24.850 --> 35:26.488
until we're ready
to make our move.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.112
Where is Mrs.
Florrick going?

35:30.390 --> 35:32.255
I-I don't know.

35:32.290 --> 35:35.293
My guess is...
she might stay with Will.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.864
But I'd like her
to come with me.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.868
Thank you, Diane,
for this confidence,

35:41.900 --> 35:43.936
but I can't
commIt to a move.

35:43.970 --> 35:45.733
I have to see where
the chips fall first.

35:45.770 --> 35:46.759
I understand.

35:48.710 --> 35:50.234
You're being wiretapped.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.643
You'll need
a good lavwer.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.610
TAP TECH (on recording):
5/22/10, 8:33 pm.

36:00.650 --> 36:01.856
WADE:
Alderman Wade.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.687
WILL:
"Alderman Wade"? Listen to you.

36:03.720 --> 36:08.259
WADE (laughs): Hey, Will, I saw
it was you, man. It was a joke.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.359
WILL:
I don't think it was a joke.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.765
I think you've turned into

36:11.800 --> 36:14.667
Alderman Wade,
Savior of the 53rd Ward.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.396
WADE: Yep, no time
for the little people.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.431
So did you talk to her?
I did.

36:19.470 --> 36:20.869
And?
Choked.

36:20.910 --> 36:23.470
WADE: No, you're kidding.
What'd she say?

36:23.510 --> 36:24.943
WILL: Nothing,
she didn't say anything.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.642
She blew you off?
She didn't even phone me back.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.318
I asked her
to phone me back and...

36:29.350 --> 36:32.387
WADE: Wait a minute, you didn't
talk to her in person?

36:32.420 --> 36:33.842
WILL: She was at her husband's
press conference.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.380
What was I going to do?

36:35.420 --> 36:37.388
WADE: _
Oh, come on, grow a par, dude.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.786
WILL:
I did; I even phoned her twice.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.298
Once, I said, "Let's move on,"
then I phoned back to...

36:42.330 --> 36:44.366
TAP TECH:
2518 minimization.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.664
30-second break.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.407
Tap resumed.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.476
WADE:
I guess I thought
it was obvious.

36:54.510 --> 36:57.502
You spill your heart in person;
you don't do it in a voice mail.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.246
WILL:
I don't know.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.009
WADE:
Right, that's why
I'm telling you.

37:01.050 --> 37:03.848
Now, listen to me.
Go to her now

37:03.880 --> 37:07.680
and you're going to say
the same thing in person.

37:09.820 --> 37:13.256
WILL:
No, I'm done.

37:13.290 --> 37:16.657
I'm over it, and that's good.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.419
It's like something lifted.

37:19.470 --> 37:22.496
If I weren't her boss
and she weren't married, and...

37:22.540 --> 37:24.929
we'd be having
a different conversation,

37:24.970 --> 37:27.962
but... she's right
not to phone...

37:28.010 --> 37:30.376
and I'm good with it.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.641
(gasps)

37:40.620 --> 37:42.611
(door buzzing)

37:46.730 --> 37:48.391
(sighs)

38:02.410 --> 38:03.900
(beeps)

38:06.110 --> 38:08.908
WILL:
Hey, I just wanted to say...

38:08.950 --> 38:11.942
Look, you're right.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.709
I don't have a plan.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.909
It's wrong.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.484
I'm your boss,
you're my employee.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.021
Let's just drop this.

38:19.060 --> 38:21.051
Okay?

38:36.510 --> 38:38.774
Your Honor, in my opinion,
if I may be allowed just to
No, in my opinion, we've

38:38.810 --> 38:40.004
make my point, Counselor...
presented
sufficient evidence...

38:40.050 --> 38:42.610
Ms. Lockhart, I am seeing no
reason to dismiss these charges.

38:42.650 --> 38:43.617
The motion is denied.

38:43.650 --> 38:46.517
We will continue
to trIal.

38:46.550 --> 38:48.484
Now...

38:50.390 --> 38:51.254
Is there anything else?

38:51.290 --> 38:54.396
Yes, just one more thing,
Your Honor.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.897
Your Honor, we ask
that subpoenas be ordered

39:00.930 --> 39:03.797
for a person caught speaking
on the government wiretaps.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.400
I'm not allowing a fishing
expedition here, Counselor.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.634
I understand that,
Your Honor.

39:07.670 --> 39:09.638
In our opinion,
there is only one person

39:09.680 --> 39:12.547
we need in order to offer
context to the charge

39:12.580 --> 39:16.072
that Alderman Wade was bought
by Islamic extremists.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.417
And who is that?

39:17.450 --> 39:19.486
Ruth Yamaguchi.

39:21.520 --> 39:24.819
This witness is
on the government tapes?
She is, Your Honor,

39:24.860 --> 39:27.158
discussing Alderman Wade's
relationship with Muslims.

39:27.190 --> 39:30.455
Your Honor, just to be clear,

39:30.500 --> 39:34.163
Ruth Yamaguchi is...

39:34.200 --> 39:36.532
she works at the White House.

39:36.570 --> 39:37.832
And...?

39:37.870 --> 39:39.167
(sighs)

39:39.210 --> 39:42.839
Her_ connection to this case
Is tangentIal, at best.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.643
In your opinion?

39:45.710 --> 39:47.746
Yeah, of course.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.509
Your Honor, we understand

39:49.550 --> 39:52.041
that Ms. Yamaguchi works
for President Obama,

39:52.090 --> 39:54.456
and there may be some
reluctance to hear

39:54.490 --> 39:58.119
President Barack Obama's name
mentIoned In the same sentence

39:58.160 --> 40:00.025
as ::Muslim" and
terrorIst,"

40:00.060 --> 40:02.528
but in my opinion,

40:02.560 --> 40:05.495
that should have no impact
on the path to justice.

40:05.530 --> 40:07.691
I would agree.

40:07.730 --> 40:08.867
The subpoena is
so ordered.

40:08.900 --> 40:11.607
Is there
anything else?

40:12.970 --> 40:15.973
Ms. Vashey?

40:16.010 --> 40:17.875
VASHEY:
Your Honor,

40:17.910 --> 40:21.949
_ we will need
a fIve-mInute recess.

40:31.020 --> 40:33.022
Bad time?

40:36.930 --> 40:40.127
*

40:54.720 --> 40:57.109
*

41:02.160 --> 41:04.981
Brad Pitt_ has
an earrIng.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.021
(chuckles)

41:10.560 --> 41:12.096
We're studying,
Grandma.

41:12.130 --> 41:14.690
I know.

41:15.270 --> 41:17.591
She doesn't like me.

41:17.640 --> 41:21.098
Tell her you have a
4.2 GPA, and she will.

41:21.140 --> 41:24.701
No, my guess is
she still wouldn't like me.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.699
(computer beeps)

41:27.750 --> 41:29.172
NISA: Who's Becca?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.176
(Zach chuckles)

41:31.220 --> 41:33.780
GRACE:
For God's sake!

41:33.820 --> 41:36.186
He's done with her.
It was a one-time thing.

41:36.220 --> 41:39.121
It's over! It's done... done...
done”.done”.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.128
Would you just stop
following me?!
(hip-hop beat plays)

41:41.160 --> 41:43.025
* Beat it_!
That's your SIster?

41:43.060 --> 41:45.062
My dad already said
he beat it,

41:45.100 --> 41:46.863
and he'll beat it again,
if he has to--

41:46.900 --> 41:48.197
just like everyone else.

41:48.230 --> 41:50.061
* You gotta beat it!
When'd she do this?

41:50.100 --> 41:52.637
He slept with one hooker, okay?

41:52.670 --> 41:54.069
One hooker!
Ju-Ju-Just... one hooker!

41:54.110 --> 41:56.271
One hooker!
Hey, look, a lot of hits.

41:56.310 --> 41:57.709
What don't you understand?

41:57.740 --> 41:59.207
One hooker!
One... one.... one hooker!

41:59.250 --> 42:00.706
* Beat it
One hooker!

42:00.750 --> 42:02.547
What don't you understand?
I got to phone my dad.

42:24.340 --> 42:26.308
(gasps)
Good job.

42:26.340 --> 42:27.568
The government
freaked out

42:27.610 --> 42:29.271
about the Ruth Yamaguchi
subpoena.

42:29.310 --> 42:31.574
They're dropping
the case against Wade.

42:31.610 --> 42:33.601
Come on, Florrick,
give it up.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.575
Good job.

42:45.330 --> 42:46.888
Yeah.

42:46.930 --> 42:49.592
I, um...

42:51.400 --> 42:53.595
Do you...?

42:55.900 --> 42:57.868
I need to ask you a question.

42:57.900 --> 42:59.606
Sure.

43:01.410 --> 43:02.877
I hate your towels.

43:02.910 --> 43:05.276
Oh, hey. What's up?
