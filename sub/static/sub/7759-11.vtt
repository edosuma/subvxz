BUT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
GET MARRIED THIS SATURDAY.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.759
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.795
MERCURY IS IN RETROGRADE,

02:07.828 --> 02:11.365
A TIME OF EXTREME IMBALANCE
IN THE UNIVERSE,

02:11.399 --> 02:13.467
UPHEAVAL, MISCOMMUNICATION,

02:13.501 --> 02:14.435
AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS,

02:14.468 --> 02:17.471
RESULTING IN SERIOUS DISCORD

A CATASTROPHE.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.886
BUT ON A POSITIVE NOTE,

02:32.920 --> 02:35.356
YOU'LL REDECORATE
YOUR DINING ROOM AROUND JUNE

SO WHAT DO YOU GET TWO DYKES
WHO HAVE EVERYTHING?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.907
- DYKES DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.310
THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE SO MISERABLE.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.779
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
MATCHING PENIS TRANSPLANTS

02:58.812 --> 03:02.283
ARE A LITTLE PRICY FOR
A POOR SHOPKEEPER LIKE MYSELF.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.851

03:12.626 --> 03:14.262
- WHAT?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.929
- LESBIANS ARE

03:15.963 --> 03:18.499
- YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY
THEY AREN'T ONE OF THEM.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.967

I HAVE FINALLY SAVED UP
ENOUGH CASH

I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.592
TITS THAT ARE TOO BIG.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.560
YOU COULD END UP
THE NEXT COSMETIC CASUALTY.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.462
- IT'S TRUE.
WHAT IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.698
- LIKE ACCIDENTALLY SEWING UP
YOUR ASSHOLE?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.500

- THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT
UPHEAVALS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

04:02.410 --> 04:04.345
CAN CAUSE DISTURBANCES
HERE ON EARTH.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.746
- BLAMING THE PLANETS
FOR YOUR FUCK-UPS

04:05.779 --> 04:09.717
IS JUST AN EXCUSE
NOT TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.019
[overlapping chatter]

04:12.052 --> 04:13.354
- GENTLEMEN!

04:47.355 --> 04:49.357
- OH, YEAH?
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GO AWAY

04:49.390 --> 04:51.024
AND STILL BE AT
MELANIE AND LINDSAY'S WEDDING?

WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- YOU OKAY, UNCLE VIC?

05:05.873 --> 05:09.510
- SEE FOR YOURSELF.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.612
- THEY'RE REEVALUATING
YOUR DISABILITY?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.614
- AND IF THEY TAKE IT AWAY,
THERE GOES MY SHARE

05:13.647 --> 05:14.882
OF OUR MONTHLY INCOME.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.784
- WELL, GOD DAMN IT!

05:16.817 --> 05:18.652
WHAT KIND OF
FUCKED UP UNIVERSE

05:18.686 --> 05:21.889
WOULD SNATCH MY BROTHER
FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH

05:21.922 --> 05:24.124
ONLY TO SLOWLY STARVE
BOTH OF US

05:24.157 --> 05:25.793
OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.628
- BEN SAYS IT'S GOT TO DO
WITH MERCURY.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.696
- OH, DOES HE?

05:28.729 --> 05:31.399
- LOOK, DON'T PANIC.
I CAN HELP OUT.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.800
- NO.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.001
MICHAEL, THIS IS A SIGN.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.869
IF I LOSE MY BENEFITS, THEN...

05:35.903 --> 05:38.038
I'LL JUST HAVE
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.773
- ARE YOU SURE?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.476
- ONCE UPON A TIME,
I WAS A PRETTY DECENT CHEF.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.378
- DECENT?
HAH.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.779
DECENT?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.748
HE WAS ANOTHER SARA LEE.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.450
- I'LL TAKE THAT
AS THE COMPLIMENT

05:49.483 --> 05:52.520
THAT I'M SURE WAS INTENDED.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.622
THE TRICK WILL BE FINDING
SOMEBODY WILLING TO HIRE ME.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.490
- WELL, THERE'S
NO SHORTAGE OF RESTAURANTS.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.826
- THERE'S ALSO
NO SHORTAGE OF CHEFS.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.861
I'M RUSTY AS AN OLD SKILLET.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.464
AND WHEN THEY FIND OUT
WHY I HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING,

06:03.497 --> 06:05.899
THEIR SOUFFLES WILL DROP.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.968
- WOULD YOU STOP TALKING
YOURSELF OUT OF A JOB

06:08.001 --> 06:12.906
BEFORE YOU EVEN GET ONE?

06:12.940 --> 06:15.809
WHAT IF I GOT YOU
A SHIFT AT THE DINER?

06:15.843 --> 06:18.145
WE COULD WORK TOGETHER.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.048

08:07.955 --> 08:09.790
YOU COULD STRETCH IT OUT,

AND IT'D STILL HOLD ITS SHAPE.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.871
WE CAN DO A CUSTOM DESIGN.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.606
OF COURSE,

A LITTLE ANXIETY-RELATED

HERE. BREATHE INTO THIS.
THERE WE GO, THERE WE GO.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.778
THERE WE GO.
OKAY. LIE DOWN.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.179
PUT YOUR FEET UP.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.347
THAT'S IT.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.050
- [rapid panting]

09:43.083 --> 09:45.986
I AM NOT GOING TO GET
INTO MY DRESS.

- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT WE AGREED,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.656
NO WEIRD LESBO SEX

09:54.862 --> 09:55.963
IN MIAMI INSTEAD.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.765
- YOU CAN'T DITCH
MY SPECIAL DAY!

09:57.798 --> 09:59.667
- YOU SELFISH PRICK.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.769
- AS USUAL,
OBJECTIVITY FALLS TO ME.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.636
THINK.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.772
YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT ME THERE, DO YOU?

10:04.805 --> 10:07.340
I'D HAVE TO BE CHEMICALLY
DEPENDENT JUST TO SHOW UP.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.142
I'LL BE DRUNK, I'LL BE BORED,

10:09.176 --> 10:11.712
NOT TO MENTION BETTER-LOOKING
THAN THE BRIDES.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.748
I'LL OFFEND ALL THE DYKES,
I'LL HECKLE THE CEREMONY,

10:14.782 --> 10:16.049
TABLE-DANCE AT THE RECEPTION,

10:16.083 --> 10:18.018
AND INEVITABLY FUCK
EVERY GOOD-LOOKING GUY,

10:18.051 --> 10:20.120
GAY, STRAIGHT, OR UNDECIDED
IN THE PLACE.

10:20.153 --> 10:24.257
FINALLY, I'LL PASS OUT NAKED,
BITCHING ABOUT THE CHEAP BOOZE.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.026
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR DIGNITY,
YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOUR SHIRTS

10:26.059 --> 10:27.327
PAYING FOR THE DAMAGES.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.262
HELL, I'M DOING YOU
A FAVOR

ABOUT 11 MINUTES.

SEEMS A LOT LONGER WHEN
YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR LESBIANS.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.791
- I STILL SAY A WEDDING GIFT
SHOULD BE SOMETHING ROMANTIC.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.359
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.228
- LINGERIE?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.330
I THOUGHT YOU SAID "ROMANTIC"?

YOU WANT TO GET TWO DYKES
A ROMANTIC GIFT?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.268
GET THEM THIS.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.137

I'LL COVER IT, WE'LL JUST
SAY IT'S FROM BOTH OF US.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.220

THE POWER TOOLS OR THE LINGERIE?
- YOU DECIDE.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.812
WHATEVER YOU PICK, I'M SURE

ALL-EXPENSE PAID FUCK FEST

13:23.036 --> 13:25.105
WAS JUST FOR THE WEEKEND.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.606

ITS OWN THEME

13:26.639 --> 13:29.009

THE CABANA BOY CONTEST.

- NOT IF YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.007

14:54.527 --> 14:57.230
- NUMBER THREE'S
PERT AND PERKY.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.632
THOUGH IT MIGHT BE TOO SMALL
FOR THE REST OF YOUR FEATURES.

- PERHAPS I NEED
AN ARTIST'S OPINION.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.939
JUSTIN, WHICH DO YOU
FIND TO BE

15:05.973 --> 15:07.340
MOST AESTHETICALLY PLEASING?

15:07.374 --> 15:08.675
- [chuckles]

15:08.708 --> 15:11.344
- THIS ONE.

IT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATES
FORM AND FUNCTION

15:13.313 --> 15:15.348
INTO AN ELEGANT WHOLE,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

15:15.382 --> 15:16.583
IT'S IN GOOD TASTE.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.685
- HE DOESN'T WANT AN ASS
WITH GOOD TASTE.

15:18.718 --> 15:22.055
HE WANTS AN ASS
THAT TASTES GOOD.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.992
- THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID
TO LET ANYONE KNOW

16:08.301 --> 16:10.003
THAT YOU LOVE THEM,

16:10.037 --> 16:14.007
THAT YOU HAVE FEELINGS
LIKE THE REST OF US.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.177
IT'S OKAY TO BE HUMAN,
YOU KNOW.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.446
- OKAY.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.250
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
THE REASON I BAIL?

16:23.283 --> 16:26.519
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D RATHER GET LAID.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.188

16:44.471 --> 16:45.705
USUALLY WHEN HE'S REALLY DRUNK

16:45.738 --> 16:48.475
OR HE WANTS ME TO SHUT UP.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.243
- AH.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.749
- I STICK IT AND SPIN.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.385
OKAY?
NOW WHEN IT'S READY,

16:58.418 --> 17:00.487
YOU PLATE 'EM, YOU DROP
THE TAB UNDER THE DISH,

17:00.520 --> 17:02.055
YOU THROW IT HERE,
AND THEN YOU RING THE BELL.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.357
[bell rings]

17:04.391 --> 17:07.227
- STICK IT, SPIN 'EM, DROP 'EM.
[bell rings]

17:07.260 --> 17:08.528
- WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.730
SHORT ORDERING'S NO DIFFERENT
THAN BEING A CHEF.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.165
- JUST FASTER.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.535
- HEY, WE GOT HUSTLE
IN OUR BLOOD.

OKAY, NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
YOUR FIRST TIP.

JUST TAKE YOUR TIME, OKAY?

17:25.178 --> 17:27.114
YOUR WORST

17:27.147 --> 17:28.781
FOR THIS JOINT.

17:28.815 --> 17:32.485
OKAY?

17:32.519 --> 17:34.321
- IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL.

17:34.354 --> 17:38.358
HEY, DEBBIE. WE NEED A COUPLE
OF BLACK COFFEES TO GO.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.459

17:39.492 --> 17:42.362
WITH OUR NAMES ON THEM
AND EVERYTHING.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.400
- I HATE TO TELL YOU, GALS,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.202
BUT FOR THE HAPPY COUPLE,

17:49.236 --> 17:50.570
YOU LOOK FUCKING MISERABLE.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.172
- ROSENBERG'S JEWELRY CALLED.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.141
THEY CAN'T FIND
OUR WEDDING RINGS.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.309
- YOU CAN USE
MY NIPPLE RINGS.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.278
LOADS OF SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.279
TO ME.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.780
- THANKS, HONEY.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.782

THE SAME.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.384
- LISTEN...
- NO.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.252
- WE'RE NOT GOING
TO ALLOW MERCURY

18:05.285 --> 18:07.387
OR ANYTHING ELSE
TO FUCK UP OUR WEDDING.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.590
EVERYTHING'S GOING AHEAD
AS PLANNED.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.560
- UH, NOT EXACTLY EVERYTHING.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.262
- MORE GOOD NEWS?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.729
- BRIAN INVITED ME
TO THE WHITE PARTY.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.565
- AND YOU SAID?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.268
- THAT I'D GO.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.270
IT'S A ONCE
IN A LIFETIME THING.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.606
- SO IS GETTING MARRIED.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.707
'COURSE THERE ARE
NO HARD BODIES.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.343
NO DRUGS, NO THOUSANDS
OF DICKS.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.146
JUST TWO PEOPLE SAYING,
"I DO."

18:33.180 --> 18:36.183
YOU'RE RIGHT,
HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY COMPARE?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.484
- IT'S OKAY.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
AFTER ALL JUSTIN'S BEEN
THROUGH.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.587
- YEAH, HE DESERVES A BREAK.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.757
HAVE A GREAT TIME.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.858
- [sighs]

18:45.892 --> 18:48.161
- OH, THAT FUCKING BRIAN.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.629
IT'S BAD ENOUGH HE'S NOT COMING,
DOES HE HAVE TO POACH

18:49.662 --> 18:50.830
OUR RING BEARER AS WELL?

18:50.863 --> 18:52.465
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
THERE ARE NO RINGS.

18:52.499 --> 18:55.635
[cell phone rings]
HEY, HONEY.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.504
[phone beeps]
HELLO?

18:57.537 --> 18:58.771
- [woman speaking
indistinctly on phone]

18:58.805 --> 19:00.773
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?

19:00.807 --> 19:03.310
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- IT MUST BE THE CATERER.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.845
JO, WHAT KOSHER VEGAN DELICACY
HAVE YOU WHIPPED UP?

19:05.878 --> 19:07.514
- I'M SORRY.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.717
- OH, WAIT. LISTEN,
YOU BLEEDING ASSHOLE!

19:10.750 --> 19:12.785
I'M A LAWYER,
WE HAVE A CONTRACT, WE'LL SUE.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.855
- SUE?
- OH, THAT WORD YOU UNDERSTAND.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.458
[phone beeps[
- SOMETHING WRONG?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.492
THE CATERER AND THE HALL

19:19.526 --> 19:20.793
HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN
BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT,

19:20.827 --> 19:22.262
FOR SALMONELLA POISONING.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.430
- [laughs mockingly]

19:23.463 --> 19:25.332
IS THAT ALL? IS THAT ALL.
- IS THAT ALL? IS THAT ALL?

19:25.365 --> 19:27.367
WE HAVE NO FOOD, WE HAVE
NO PLACE TO EAT THE FOOD.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.535
- [hyperventilating]

19:28.568 --> 19:30.770
OKAY, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.539
I THINK I'LL LIE DOWN FOR A BIT,
OKAY?

19:32.572 --> 19:37.577
- YEAH.
- [rapid panting]

19:38.711 --> 19:42.815
- YOU SPENT $500--
MY $500 ON THAT?

19:42.849 --> 19:43.950
- IT WAS A STEAL.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.352
- YEAH, AND I'M THE ONE
THAT GOT ROBBED.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.353
LOOK, JUST TAKE IT BACK.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.620
- I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.788
WHAT STORE DID YOU BUY IT AT?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.690
- I DIDN'T GET IT AT A STORE.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.691
- WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

19:51.724 --> 19:52.692
- OFF A BLANKET.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.761
- A BLANKET?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.629
YOU BOUGHT LINDSAY
AND MELANIE'S WEDDING GIFT

19:56.663 --> 19:58.265
FROM SOME STREET CORNER
SHYSTER?

19:58.298 --> 19:59.366
- IT'S FROM CHUCK.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.800
IT'S A LITTLE COUNTRY
NEXT TO CHAD.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.902
- CHUCK? CHAD? THEY SOUND LIKE
A COUPLE OF HOMOS.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.304
- IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.972
- PERFECTLY HIDEOUS.
- IT'S A WORK OF ART!

20:06.005 --> 20:06.773
- IT'S A PIECE OF SHIT.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.908
- IT'S SYMBOLIC
OF LOVE AND PRIDE.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.977
- IT'S SYMBOLIC OF STUPIDITY
AND BAD TASTE.

20:11.010 --> 20:11.778
- YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.281
- I CAN'T.
I GOT IT OFF A BLANKET.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.648
- LOOK, THE NEXT TIME
YOU WANT TO BUY A GIFT,

20:15.682 --> 20:16.849
BUY IT YOURSELF.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.551
- THAT'S WHAT
I WAS COUNTING ON YOU FOR.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.321
- YEAH, YOU WERE TOO BUSY
BRINGING JOY TO THE WORLD.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.422
- LOOK, JUST BECAUSE
I'M A SUCCESS--

20:22.455 --> 20:23.423
- YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SUCCESS

20:23.456 --> 20:24.591
AND SHOVE IT.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.592
AND I'M SURE YOU WON'T
HAVE ANY TROUBLE

20:25.625 --> 20:26.826
FIGURING OUT WHERE.

20:26.859 --> 20:31.564
- YEAH, I'LL JUST ASK
CHUCK AND CHAD.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.438
- I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.307
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.610
- BUT IT'S SUCH A...

20:43.643 --> 20:45.345
BEAUTIFUL BOTTOM.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.813
- IT'LL DO IN A PINCH.

20:46.846 --> 20:47.980
- I'LL SAY.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.749
BESIDES, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

20:49.782 --> 20:53.019
I MEAN, PLASTIC SURGERY
IS JUST FOR FOOLISH OLD MEN

20:53.052 --> 20:57.990
WHO REFUSE TO GROW OLD
GRACEFULLY.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.692
- WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON?

20:59.726 --> 21:02.695
AND ELIZABETH TAYLOR
AND CHER?

21:02.729 --> 21:05.865
- WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK
FOR THEIR BACKSIDES,

21:05.898 --> 21:07.367
ONLY YOURS.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.901
- THANK YOU.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.504
BUT IN MY WORLD,
IF YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU

21:11.538 --> 21:14.006
JUST STEPPED OUT OF
A CALVIN KLEIN UNDERWEAR AD,

21:14.040 --> 21:15.842
YOU'RE NOTHING.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.378
- WELL, THAT'S A WORLD
I'M HAPPY NOT TO KNOW.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.313
- NOT TO MENTION,

21:20.347 --> 21:22.048
IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF.

21:22.081 --> 21:25.352
YOU KNOW,
RAISE MY SELF-ESTEEM.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.920
- WELL, MY WIFE VIRGINIA
FELT SIMILARLY.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.890
HAD HERSELF SNIPPED AND CLIPPED,
EYES TO THIGHS.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.892
SWORE IT WOULD
CHANGE HER LIFE TOO.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.661
- AND DID IT?

21:34.694 --> 21:37.029
- SHE WAS THE SAME MISERABLE
CUNT SHE ALWAYS WAS.

21:37.063 --> 21:40.333
ONLY WITHOUT THE WRINKLES.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.001
NOW EMMETT...

21:42.034 --> 21:43.636
FORGIVE ME.

21:43.670 --> 21:48.641
BUT ANYONE WHO VALUES THEMSELVES
BECAUSE OF THEIR ASS...

21:48.675 --> 21:51.578
IS AN ASS.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.815
[overlapping chatter]

21:55.848 --> 21:57.083
- OH, I'M SO SORRY
YOU'RE STILL WAITING.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.518
MORE COFFEE?
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.420
NO?
OKAY.

22:00.453 --> 22:03.823
UM, YOUR ORDER IS NEXT,
I PROMISE YOU.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.959
- ALL I WANT IS A HAMBURGER!

22:06.993 --> 22:10.363
- YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN
ABDUCTED BY ALIENS,

22:10.397 --> 22:12.432
SO DON'T GIVE ME
THOSE DIRTY LOOKS.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.401
[dishes clatter]

22:14.434 --> 22:15.702
- HEY, DEBBIE,
WHAT'S UP WITH MY ORDER?

22:15.735 --> 22:16.703
[bell rings]

22:16.736 --> 22:18.405
- HEY!

22:18.438 --> 22:20.707
I HAVE GOT ORDERS COMING
OUT MY ASS,

22:20.740 --> 22:23.042
A ROOM FULL
OF HUNGRY HOMICIDALS,

22:23.075 --> 22:24.577
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANY CLEAN PLATES

22:24.611 --> 22:25.978
TO DO MY SET-UPS WITH.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.947
WHAT IN THE FUCK
IS GOING ON BACK HERE?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.649
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.850
I'M RIGHT HERE.

22:30.883 --> 22:31.818
- WELL, YOU COULD HAVE
FOOLED ME.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.720
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
DO A GRILLED CHEESE

22:33.753 --> 22:34.921
IN UNDER AN HOUR?

22:34.954 --> 22:38.858
- YOU TOLD ME TO TAKE MY TIME.
- DEBBIE!

22:38.891 --> 22:40.727
- I DIDN'T MEAN
YOUR FUCKING LIFETIME.

22:40.760 --> 22:44.397
- [sighs]
THAT DOES IT.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.798
- EXCUSE ME.
- WHO AM I KIDDING?

22:45.832 --> 22:46.933
- EXCUSE ME!
- I CAN'T DO THIS.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.668
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

22:48.701 --> 22:49.669
HOME.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.438
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.672
- YOU'RE BETTER OFF.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.608
I'M USELESS.
I'M WORSE THAN USELESS.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.844
I'M RIDICULOUS.
- TEN MORE MINUTES, I PROMISE.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.412
- WE'RE HUNGRY!

22:59.446 --> 23:02.715
- HONEY, THERE IS NO WAY
WE CAN SQUEEZE

23:02.749 --> 23:04.617
THAT MANY GUESTS
INTO OUR HOUSE.

23:04.651 --> 23:07.119
- BABY, WE CAN MOVE ALL
THE FURNITURE INTO THE GARAGE.

23:07.153 --> 23:11.691
- LAMBSKIN, YOU'D HAVE
MY 1,000-YEAR-OLD AUNT

23:11.724 --> 23:12.959
STAND ALL NIGHT?

23:12.992 --> 23:15.094
- PUDDING PIE,
SHE HAS A WALKER.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.429
SHE CAN LEAN.

23:16.463 --> 23:18.631
- AND WHAT IF, SOMEHOW,

23:18.665 --> 23:21.033
MY LITTLE LOVE BUTTON,

23:21.067 --> 23:24.170
WE MANAGE TO OVERCOME THE LAWS
OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE

23:24.203 --> 23:25.705
AND PACK 'EM ALL IN?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.907
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE THEY GOING TO SEE

23:27.940 --> 23:29.609
BESIDES EACH OTHERS'
NOSE HAIR?

23:29.642 --> 23:31.478
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.513
- AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING
TO MAKE SENSE.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.881
- THERE'S NO NEED TO BE ABUSIVE.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.716
- I WASN'T BEING ABUSIVE.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.652
I WAS MERELY EXPRESSING...

23:39.686 --> 23:40.653
FRUSTRATION.

23:40.687 --> 23:41.721
- SO NOW I'M FRUSTRATING?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.490
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
[groans]

23:43.523 --> 23:44.491
[knock on door]

23:44.524 --> 23:46.926
- CLEANING'S HERE. AH.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.163
- YOURS, MEL.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.901
AND WHAT WAS YOURS, LINZ.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.804
APPARENTLY THE DRY-CLEANING
SOLUTION WAS TOO--

23:57.837 --> 24:02.074
- THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.

24:02.108 --> 24:07.013
AT THIS POINT IN THE PLOT,
WE ALL GET IT.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.080
- BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,

24:08.114 --> 24:11.751
THEY GAVE YOU $100 WORTH
OF COUPONS.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.152
- HURRAY.

24:13.185 --> 24:17.490
- WE WILL FIND YOU SOMETHING
ELSE TO WEAR, BOO-BOO.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.626
AND WE WILL HAVE
OUR BEAUTIFUL,

24:19.659 --> 24:22.228
SPECIAL FUCKING DAY,
GODDAMN IT!

24:22.261 --> 24:26.165
EVEN IF WE HAVE TO DO IT NUDE
IN THE BACKYARD.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.536
[thunder rumbles]

24:29.569 --> 24:30.537
[Gus crying]

24:30.570 --> 24:34.707
- OR MAYBE WE CAN FACE REALITY.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.676
MYSTERIOUS MARILYN WAS RIGHT.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.580
- OH, NOT THAT MERCURY
IN RETROGRADE SHIT AGAIN.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.181
- OUR WEDDING'S
BEEN METHODICALLY

24:42.214 --> 24:44.216
AND SYSTEMATICALLY
DECONSTRUCTED.

24:44.250 --> 24:47.086
IF YOU ASK ME,
SOMEBODY UP THERE

24:47.119 --> 24:50.557
DOESN'T THINK
WE SHOULD GET MARRIED.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.993
MAYBE THERE'S A REASON.

24:54.026 --> 24:58.998
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
PEOPLE LIKE US...

24:59.031 --> 25:00.700
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.068
- "LIKE US"?

25:02.101 --> 25:03.235
- DO YOU NEED THE ROOF
TO CAVE IN?

25:03.269 --> 25:06.639
[crying continues]

25:15.615 --> 25:18.585
[eerie music]

25:18.618 --> 25:26.525
*

25:37.069 --> 25:41.107
- YOU KNOW, I'M REMINDED
OF A SCENE FROM ALIEN.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.777
ONE OF THE GREAT AIDS METAPHOR
FLICKS OF ALL TIME.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.046
OUR INTREPID INTERGALACTIC
GARBAGE COLLECTORS,

25:47.079 --> 25:49.649
LED BY UBER-BITCH DYKE RIPLEY,

25:49.682 --> 25:52.785
AFTER WHO YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
MODELED YOURSELF,

25:52.819 --> 25:55.321
ARE SNUGGLED SAFELY
IN THEIR SLEEP PODS

25:55.354 --> 25:57.189
FOR THE LONG RIDE HOME

25:57.223 --> 25:59.792
WHEN SUDDENLY
THE MONSTER APPEARS.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.928
- THE WEDDING'S OFF.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.864
- YOU TWO HAVE FINALLY COME
TO YOUR SENSES?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.799
THAT'S ALMOST REASON ENOUGH

26:06.833 --> 26:08.868
TO INTERRUPT MY BASE COAT.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.004
BUT NOT QUITE.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.073
- IT'S BECAUSE OF LINDSAY.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.142
SHE--
[sobs]

26:16.175 --> 26:17.343
SHE...

26:17.376 --> 26:19.211
- SHE WHAT?

26:19.245 --> 26:24.050
- WITH ALL THE DISASTERS
AND MYSTERIOUS MARILYN,

26:24.083 --> 26:27.219
MERCURY IN RETROGRADE
AND THE RINGS AND THE FOOD

26:27.253 --> 26:30.322
AND THE HALL AND THE DRESS,

26:30.356 --> 26:32.358
SHE THINKS THE WEDDING'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE--

26:32.391 --> 26:35.361
BECAUSE WE'RE GAY.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.897
- CHRIST.

26:37.930 --> 26:43.102
SEND IN A DYKE
TO DO A FAGGOT'S WORK.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.072
WE HAVE PRECISELY 21 HOURS

26:46.105 --> 26:48.174
TO GET THE MUNCHERS MARRIED.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.810
- WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY?
- WE CAN'T DO THAT.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.779
- NOBODY KNOWS WEDDING SHIT
BETTER THAN QUEERS.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.714
WE'RE THE FLORISTS,
THE CATERERS,

26:54.747 --> 26:56.783
THE PLANNERS, THE DESIGNERS.

26:56.816 --> 27:00.252
THE SERVERS, THE PERFORMERS,
EVEN FUCKING PRIESTS.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.988
- HE MEANS THAT LITERALLY.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.022
- IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT,
WE CAN.

27:03.055 --> 27:06.325
AND WE WILL, IN TIME FOR ME
TO MAKE MY FLIGHT.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.094
- DON'T YOU THINK
THIS IS AWFULLY AMBITIOUS?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.028
- WHY DON'T
YOU JUST LEAVE IT UP

27:09.061 --> 27:10.730
TO EVERYBODY ELSE
SO YOU CAN CRITICIZE?

27:10.763 --> 27:11.864
- IF WE LEFT IT UP TO YOU,

27:11.898 --> 27:13.265
THEY'D BE GETTING MARRIED
ON A BLANKET

27:13.299 --> 27:14.734
ON A STREET CORNER.
- YO, BITCHES,

27:14.767 --> 27:16.135
TEAR EACH OTHER'S
HAIR OUT LATER.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.336
I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT,

27:17.369 --> 27:19.405
BUT YOU TWO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR STAFFING,

27:19.438 --> 27:21.841
FLOWERS, AND DECORATIONS.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.210
- EMMETT, YOU FIND US A PLACE.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.145
- OH, HOW ABOUT
THE LIBERTY BATHS?

27:26.178 --> 27:29.682
THEY HAVE
A FABULOUS PARTY ROOM.

27:29.716 --> 27:33.019
- DEB, YOU PULL TOGETHER
SOMETHING FOR LINZ TO WEAR.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.687
- I'D LOVE TO.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.123
OH, I CAN JUST SEE IT
WITH ITS FLOWERS

27:37.156 --> 27:41.027
AND BOWS AND RUFFLES AND--

27:41.060 --> 27:44.430
MAYBE SOMETHING MORE SIMPLE.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.427
BUT I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T GIVE

28:15.461 --> 28:16.763
A SHIT ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS,

28:16.796 --> 28:18.430
THAT YOU ONLY CARE
ABOUT GETTING LAID.

28:18.464 --> 28:21.801

THE WORD "WEDDING" AGAIN.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.504
I'M AFRAID
THERE IS NO SUCH THING

28:58.537 --> 29:01.207
AS AN INSTANT WEDDING.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.309
- IF I MAY MAKE A SUGGESTION?

29:03.342 --> 29:06.112
- BE MY WEDDING GUEST.
