00:01.040 --> 00:01.830
ANNOUNCER:
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.830 --> 00:02.960
- That just about blew my mind.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.330
I think you should
come down to my office.

00:04.330 --> 00:06.330
At Highway 65,
let's have a conversation.

00:06.330 --> 00:09.330
- I can't be in a committed
relationship, right now.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.960
- So you are gonna
sleep with him.

00:14.420 --> 00:17.120
- Don't be scared.
I just wanna talk to you.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.540
- Drop the weapon!
Let her go now! Drop it!

00:19.540 --> 00:21.380
- Are you okay,
did he hurt you?

00:21.380 --> 00:22.460
We're gonna get you out
of here, okay?

00:22.460 --> 00:23.960
- Something terrible happened.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.120
- Come home, baby.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.420
- We got a 47-year-old female.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.830
Status: post high-speed
motor vehicle collision.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.670
Blood pressure 90 over 45.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.120
Heart rate of 118.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.830
Patient was found unconscious

00:40.830 --> 00:42.710
with a crush injury to her
pelvis and proximal femur.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.790
- Okay, let's send out
for a trauma panel.

00:44.790 --> 00:46.250
And type and cross for four.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.210
- Oh, my God.
- Is there a problem, Dickenson?

00:48.210 --> 00:49.380
- That's Rayna James.
- Yep.

00:49.380 --> 00:52.790
Okay, one, two, three,
lift!

00:52.790 --> 00:54.170
There's no time
for autographs, people.

00:54.170 --> 00:55.330
Let's move!

00:59.670 --> 01:01.460
- Man, that was so cool
of your mom

01:01.460 --> 01:03.040
to show up like that.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.170
- Yeah, you should totally
take her up on the offer.

01:05.170 --> 01:07.290
- I don't know.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.040
I just don't wanna trade in
on whatever's going on

01:09.040 --> 01:10.250
with you and me right now.

01:12.710 --> 01:15.330
What?
- (laughs)

01:15.330 --> 01:19.040
- Nothing. You're just awesome,
that's all.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.500
(cell phone rings)

01:21.500 --> 01:22.670
Hey, Dad.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.330
(horn honking)

01:24.330 --> 01:25.710
- Are you with Clay?

01:25.710 --> 01:28.120
- Yeah, but don't worry.
We got, um...

01:28.120 --> 01:29.380
- Martinez.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.210
- Yeah, Officer Martinez
with us.

01:31.210 --> 01:33.250
- Sweetie, I need you to meet me
at the hospital, okay?

01:33.250 --> 01:36.000
- What? What's wrong?

01:37.290 --> 01:40.000
- How am I still here?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.830
- Last I recall,
you were looking for a sock.

01:42.830 --> 01:45.290
- (laughs) Oh, my God.

01:45.290 --> 01:46.380
- It was fun looking.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.960
- Oh, it's always fun

01:47.960 --> 01:49.620
when someone gets
an eye poked out.

01:49.620 --> 01:52.000
(cell phone rings)

01:52.000 --> 01:53.580
Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

01:53.580 --> 01:56.290
- I was supposed to meet
Gunnar and Will for dinner.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.330
Hello?

01:57.330 --> 01:58.880
- Where are you?

01:58.880 --> 01:59.880
I've been texting and calling!

01:59.880 --> 02:03.080
- My phone was off. Sorry.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.500
- Yeah, well, Deacon needs you
to pick up Daphne from school,

02:05.500 --> 02:06.880
and bring her to the hospital.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.330
- What? What happened?

02:10.330 --> 02:13.960
(choir singing)

02:44.920 --> 02:46.500
- How's she doing?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.080
- She's pretty banged up.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.460
Her CT shows a shattered
pelvis and hip.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.790
The good news is that
she doesn't appear

02:51.790 --> 02:53.330
to have any blood
in her brain.

02:53.330 --> 02:55.210
We've got our top ortho
coming in.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.120
We're having to get her into
surgery as soon as possible.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.620
- Is she in pain?

02:58.620 --> 02:59.830
- No. We've got her
on a morphine drip.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.540
So she's resting
comfortably now.

03:01.540 --> 03:02.750
- Thank you.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.170
- Can you believe this?

03:43.620 --> 03:46.620
- Police car?
- Yeah.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.460
You don't remember being in it

03:48.460 --> 03:50.500
when the police officer
drove you?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.210
She's okay.
She hardly got a scratch.

03:52.210 --> 03:55.960
- The lady officer?
Bless her heart.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.500
I just remember the, um...

04:00.500 --> 04:04.960
Carl...Wayne person.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.960
He was waving a knife
at me for an eternity.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.500
- I'm so sorry about that guy.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.830
- Where are the girls?

04:12.830 --> 04:13.830
- They're coming, honey.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.250
They're on their way.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.920
- Well, look who is
all up and talking.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.750
- Have you ever seen anybody
as handsome as this person?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.540
(chuckles)

04:22.540 --> 04:24.040
- Well, I'd say
he's a cutie pie.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.500
- Plays a mean guitar too.

04:27.170 --> 04:28.880
Honey, guess what?
- What, baby?

04:28.880 --> 04:31.620
- We are not done yet.
- We're not?

04:31.620 --> 04:33.620
- 'Cause you know now
with our record?

04:33.620 --> 04:34.790
We gotta write another song.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.170
- We do?

04:36.170 --> 04:39.170
- Yeah, because, you know...

04:39.170 --> 04:42.750
it hasn't all just been pain.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.040
We gotta write
that beautiful story.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.750
- MRSA.
- Oh, my God,

04:49.750 --> 04:51.500
you do not have
a MRSA infection.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.790
- It says right here that
it can spread to your bones.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.830
- The doctor said
bone infections

04:56.830 --> 04:59.250
are extremely rare
after surgery.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.080
- What if it's something worse?

05:01.080 --> 05:02.960
- Like what?

05:02.960 --> 05:05.710
- Like that.
- Oh...

05:08.120 --> 05:10.540
You know, my college roommate
got something like that

05:10.540 --> 05:12.620
after a trip to Amsterdam.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.500
Only it wasn't on his foot.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.170
- I'm serious.

05:18.170 --> 05:19.790
- I'm serious too.

05:19.790 --> 05:22.830
Honestly, Julia, I love you,
but you're crazy.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.960
- I'm in pain, okay?

05:24.960 --> 05:26.380
It feels like my leg is rotting
from the inside out!

05:26.380 --> 05:28.120
- Okay, okay...

05:28.120 --> 05:30.250
I will schedule an appointment
with the doctor on Monday.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.380
- No. I don't want to wait
until Monday.

05:32.380 --> 05:34.250
I want to see her tomorrow.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.290
- Of course you do.

05:35.290 --> 05:37.750
(cell phone rings)

05:41.120 --> 05:42.330
- Gross.

05:42.330 --> 05:44.080
- Hey, man, what's up?

05:46.380 --> 05:49.290
What? Is she okay?

05:52.620 --> 05:54.170
- Hey, I'll wait for you.

05:54.170 --> 05:55.620
- You don't have to do that.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.380
- No, no, no.
Just in case you need anything.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.120
- Thank you.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.670
- Maddie?
- Back up, back up...

06:00.670 --> 06:02.290
- How is your mom doing, Maddie?

06:02.290 --> 06:03.960
Any word on her condition?

06:03.960 --> 06:04.960
- How about those
assault rumors?

06:04.960 --> 06:08.500
Any truth to those?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.960
- Maddie, when's the last time
you spoke to your mother?

06:11.830 --> 06:14.000
- Does it hurt?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.670
- It hurts a little.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.620
You know, honey, I'll be honest.

06:18.620 --> 06:21.330
I don't really feel
much of anything right now.

06:21.330 --> 06:24.040
- Are you gonna be here for as
long as you were the last time?

06:24.040 --> 06:25.670
- Oh, I don't think so.

06:25.670 --> 06:29.380
Good heavens, what is it with me
and the car accidents?

06:29.380 --> 06:30.920
- Mom?
- There she is.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.380
- Hey, my girl.

06:32.380 --> 06:33.960
- I'm sorry I didn't
get here sooner.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.500
- We're glad you're here,
sweetheart.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.540
Mom's about to go into surgery.

06:36.540 --> 06:37.880
- So what happened?

06:37.880 --> 06:38.960
Someone outside said
something about an assault?

06:38.960 --> 06:40.500
- We don't have to
talk about it right now.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.000
Let's get your mom off...

06:42.000 --> 06:43.420
- Hate to break this up,
but it's show time.

06:43.420 --> 06:47.290
- I didn't get a chance
to warm up.

06:47.290 --> 06:49.420
- Well, I guess you're just
going to have to wing it.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.620
- The surgeon requested some
vintage Rayna James

06:51.620 --> 06:54.290
in the OR for inspiration.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.040
- Well, make sure
they get a good one.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.750
There are a couple of
clunkers back in the 90s.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.460
- You ready?

07:10.500 --> 07:11.670
- Hey Maddie?
- Its okay.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.620
- It's all right...
it's all right.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.500
Bye babe.
- I love you.

07:34.880 --> 07:38.580
- Maddie? Are you okay?

07:38.580 --> 07:41.040
- I just need a minute.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.750
- You wanna tell me
what's going on?

07:42.750 --> 07:46.170
- I can't right now.

07:46.170 --> 07:47.670
- Come on, don't make me
crawl under there.

07:47.670 --> 07:48.710
You know I will.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.540
- (sighs)

07:54.330 --> 07:56.170
- This is all my fault, I know.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.580
- What are you talking about?

08:00.750 --> 08:02.000
- It's like a punishment.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.210
I just know it.
- For what?

08:03.210 --> 08:05.790
- For all the trouble
I've caused.

08:05.790 --> 08:07.080
- This has nothing
to do with you.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.040
This was an accident.
- No!

08:09.040 --> 08:10.290
If she didn't come
to see Clay perform,

08:10.290 --> 08:11.670
none of this
would have happened.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.120
- That is a load of crap,
and you know it!

08:13.120 --> 08:14.380
You haven't put your mom
through any worse

08:14.380 --> 08:15.500
than any other kid your age.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.670
It's called being a teenager.

08:18.670 --> 08:20.420
- When you were a teenager,
you were perfect, so...

08:20.420 --> 08:22.170
- (laughs)

08:22.170 --> 08:24.830
It was a little bit different
with the mother I had.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.790
There wasn't room enough
for both of us to be bad, so...

08:28.790 --> 08:32.540
Your mama's not like that.

08:32.540 --> 08:34.330
And she knows you would
never wish

08:34.330 --> 08:35.710
for anything bad
to happen to her.

08:35.710 --> 08:39.880
No matter how much
you two lock horns.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.380
There ain't anything you can do
to make her feel any different.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.000
- How do you know that?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.750
- I just know.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.880
She got four hours
of surgery ahead of her.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.790
So you could get some air.

08:56.790 --> 09:00.040
Ain't nothing gonna happen
for a while.

09:08.670 --> 09:11.460
- Four hours?

09:11.460 --> 09:14.000
- Give or take.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.790
- This is gonna be
the longest four hours ever.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.330
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.580
Sweetie, I think I'm gonna have

09:28.580 --> 09:30.170
Scarlett take you home, okay?
- No!

09:30.170 --> 09:31.210
- Baby, you got
a concert tomorrow.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.540
I want you to get some sleep.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.210
- I wanna be here
when she wakes up.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.250
- Honey, your mom won't even
remember waking up.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.920
I promise I'll get you back
here in the morning, I will.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.830
- I'm not going home!

09:48.880 --> 09:52.460
- Hey. Is everything okay?

09:52.460 --> 09:54.250
- No.
- What's wrong?

09:54.250 --> 09:56.580
- She's gonna be in surgery
for four hours.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.670
So can we just drive?

10:39.620 --> 10:41.580
- How'd it go?
- Very well.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.460
She's coming out
of anesthesia.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.880
So it shouldn't be long
before she's in her room,

10:44.880 --> 10:45.960
and ready to see you.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.580
- Oh, thank God!

10:47.580 --> 10:49.420
Now what happens next?

10:49.420 --> 10:51.290
- Well, assuming
everything goes well,

10:51.290 --> 10:53.880
she can go home
in a few days.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.750
She will need a lot
of rehab, of course.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.880
But it looks like
she's gonna be okay.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.040
- Thank you.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.290
I'm sorry.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.380
Aw, thank you, guys.
- That's great.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.040
- Is it crazy that what
I really want right now

11:23.040 --> 11:24.120
is a cheeseburger?

11:24.120 --> 11:25.580
- All you been through,

11:25.580 --> 11:28.830
you deserve
a damn cheeseburger.

11:28.830 --> 11:32.250
- I'm starting to remember
what happened,

11:32.250 --> 11:36.460
the accident and the attack
and all that.

11:36.460 --> 11:37.750
I think that's the most afraid

11:37.750 --> 11:39.250
I've ever been in my whole life.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.080
And that's saying a lot.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.540
Because I've been through
some pretty scary stuff.

11:45.540 --> 11:49.170
But what's different now is that

11:49.170 --> 11:53.830
you're right here next to me.

11:53.830 --> 11:57.210
That's just the sweetest feeling
in the whole world.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.880
- Found a vase.
- Thank you, honey.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.620
Those are beautiful.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.080
Is that Bucky out there?

12:10.080 --> 12:12.790
- Yeah. We got a couple
of people out there.

12:12.790 --> 12:15.080
But they said they only wanted
immediate family in here.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.960
The nurse wants you to rest.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.210
- Oh, they could come in
and say hi.

12:19.210 --> 12:20.710
- All right.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.790
- You look good, Mom.

12:26.790 --> 12:29.420
- Oh, honey, when'd you get
to be such a good liar?

12:29.420 --> 12:31.710
Oh, hey, y'all.

12:31.710 --> 12:34.330
Bucky, you didn't have to come

12:34.330 --> 12:35.920
sit over here all night.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.040
- Of course I did.
- Of course you did.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.580
- How you feeling?

12:40.580 --> 12:42.540
- Like I was hit by a truck.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.710
Looks like the CMT Awards
are not gonna happen.

12:47.710 --> 12:48.750
- Hey, don't worry about that.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.290
I already took care of it.

12:50.290 --> 12:51.880
And everybody at CMT
wants me to tell you

12:51.880 --> 12:53.210
they want you to get
better soon.

12:53.210 --> 12:54.500
And they send you their love.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.380
- Thanks
- Okay, let's wrap it up.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.830
This young lady
needs to get some rest.

12:58.830 --> 13:00.460
- I'll check on you first thing
in the morning.

13:00.460 --> 13:01.880
- Thank you for coming.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.710
Hey, did Deacon tell you about

13:03.710 --> 13:05.580
the song we're gonna write?

13:05.580 --> 13:07.250
- The song?

13:07.250 --> 13:08.500
- I'll tell you about it later.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.920
- You gotta get
your guitar, honey.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.540
- I'm not leaving you
to go get some guitar.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.580
- I'll get it for you.
- Thank you.

13:13.580 --> 13:16.170
- Y'all the best family
a woman could ever want.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.790
Where's Maddie, y'all?

13:21.790 --> 13:23.790
- She'll be here soon.

13:23.790 --> 13:26.670
- It's like the room just
started getting smaller

13:26.670 --> 13:28.380
all of a sudden.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.420
I literally couldn't breath.

13:30.420 --> 13:32.210
It was like, you know,
those dreams

13:32.210 --> 13:36.080
when you're trying to scream,
but nothing comes out?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.330
- It sounds like you were
having a panic attack.

13:38.330 --> 13:41.420
- Oh, God, it was scary,
whatever it was.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.380
- Hey, you're okay now.

13:44.380 --> 13:45.960
Does your dad know
that you're here with me?

13:45.960 --> 13:47.290
- Yeah. He said
he's gonna text me

13:47.290 --> 13:48.580
whenever she gets out
of surgery.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.620
- Wow.
- Yeah.

13:53.620 --> 13:56.420
My Dad proposed
to my Mom up here.

13:56.420 --> 13:59.170
It's like one of her
favorite places.

13:59.170 --> 14:02.420
- Well, I can see why.

14:02.420 --> 14:05.330
- I remember this one time

14:05.330 --> 14:07.670
I was up here with her
when I was little.

14:07.670 --> 14:10.880
Just the two of us.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.710
No talking, just sort of...

14:14.710 --> 14:17.880
being with each other.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.960
And I looked over at her.

14:19.960 --> 14:24.420
And she had tears, like,
streaming down her face.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.000
And I don't know why,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.540
but it was like the first time

14:28.540 --> 14:31.500
I ever saw her as a person,

14:31.500 --> 14:34.830
you know, instead of a mom.

14:36.420 --> 14:39.500
I guess I'm feeling
a little bit better.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.210
- Walking and talking.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.670
It's the best thing
for a panic attack.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.750
- Oh, how do you know
so much about them?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.750
- Well, my mom
used to have them.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.250
- You must miss her.

14:48.250 --> 14:51.710
- It's complicated.
- Why?

14:51.710 --> 14:55.380
- It was always
a roller coaster with her.

14:55.380 --> 14:58.540
I mean, one minute she would
be the best mom ever.

14:58.540 --> 15:02.040
And then she'd start
tweaking again,

15:02.040 --> 15:03.540
and disappear on me.

15:03.540 --> 15:06.170
- It must have been so hard.

15:06.170 --> 15:09.000
- I mean, the disappearing
wasn't so bad.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.330
It was showing up again
that really sucked.

15:12.330 --> 15:15.000
Because you knew
she wouldn't stay.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.290
It's funny...

15:17.290 --> 15:18.670
It got to where
I started hoping

15:18.670 --> 15:21.380
she wouldn't come
around anymore.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.080
And then eventually she didn't.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.880
- That is so sad.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.000
(text message rings)

15:31.000 --> 15:33.170
It's my dad.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.500
Mom's out of surgery.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.750
- Well, how did it go?

15:35.750 --> 15:37.960
- Good, I guess.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.670
He and Daphne are gonna
spend the night there.

15:40.670 --> 15:43.040
- Well, I can take you back.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.880
- He's saying that the nurse
just wants her to get some rest.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.710
And for me to just go home,

15:47.710 --> 15:49.210
and come back in the morning.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.620
- I can take you home
if you want.

15:50.620 --> 15:54.330
- Can we just walk some more?

15:54.330 --> 15:55.620
- Of course, we can.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.420
- He would want his Sunburst,
I'll bet.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.080
- So are we just gonna pretend
like nothing happened?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.920
- You see a capo
lying around here anywhere?

16:12.540 --> 16:14.500
- The least you could
have done was called.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.710
You know, I sat there
for two hours waiting for you.

16:16.710 --> 16:20.540
- Well, I did tell you
that I might not make it.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.710
- All right,
just answer me this, okay?

16:22.710 --> 16:24.670
Is he so good in bed

16:24.670 --> 16:26.750
you had to spend the whole
frickin' day with him?

16:28.880 --> 16:30.920
- I'm gonna go get
Daphne's toothbrush.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.460
And I'll meet you in the car.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.750
- Well, that's it?

16:36.750 --> 16:39.420
That's all you got to say?

16:39.420 --> 16:42.040
- Juliette,
how's your leg doing?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.580
- Any idea when you'll be
up and running again?

16:43.580 --> 16:45.670
- I'm up right now.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.000
I'm not sure about
the running part.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.540
- Come on, guys,
give her some room.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.250
- Any word
on Rayna's condition.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.750
- We heard she was assaulted.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.380
Can you tell us anything
about that?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.330
- Looking for Room 208.

16:59.330 --> 17:01.000
They said it was at the end
of the hall.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.330
- I can't let you go
in there right now.

17:03.330 --> 17:04.670
I'm under strict orders.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.000
- Juliette!

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
- Well, if you happen
to know who I am,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.620
then you know I don't
take orders very well.

17:13.620 --> 17:15.460
- Miss Barnes!

17:17.830 --> 17:20.580
- She doesn't follow
my orders either.

17:20.580 --> 17:24.620
- Someone needs to tell
Nurse Ratched to relax.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.120
- Hi.
- Is this a bad time?

17:29.540 --> 17:30.750
Brought you something.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.380
- Oh, that's nice.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.500
You didn't have to do that.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.380
- Eye mask.
Saved my life

17:36.380 --> 17:38.170
when I was laying where
you are right now.

17:38.170 --> 17:40.460
Nurses coming in
every five minutes.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.670
The lights flickering.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.830
- Yeah, I'm not getting a lot
of sleep around here.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.420
- Yeah. How are you feeling?

17:47.420 --> 17:50.250
- Oh, you know.

17:50.250 --> 17:53.540
- Yeah, I do know.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.000
- Thought you were gonna
be off those by now.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.290
- Oh, you and me both, girl.

17:58.290 --> 18:01.500
- What's the holdup?

18:01.500 --> 18:04.380
- You know, I don't want to
talk about me right now.

18:04.380 --> 18:07.500
- But you're so much
better at it than I am.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.790
- I know.

18:09.790 --> 18:12.460
That's not why I'm here.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.210
What?

18:17.210 --> 18:20.290
- You've changed.

18:20.290 --> 18:23.000
- I have?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.960
- It's like when you
fell out of the sky,

18:24.960 --> 18:29.500
something shook out of you.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.040
- About time, right?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.000
- Now you've got me wondering

18:34.000 --> 18:38.040
after this whole nightmare,

18:38.040 --> 18:42.830
I wonder what's gonna
shake out of me?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.500
- Something good.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.830
- So I was thinking about
what you were saying

18:49.830 --> 18:53.120
about how your mom
was in and out of your life.

18:53.120 --> 18:57.290
And my mom was
the complete opposite.

18:57.290 --> 18:59.080
- You're lucky.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.960
- Yeah, and I have done nothing
but give her a hard time.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.710
- You?

19:04.710 --> 19:07.790
- Are you kidding? Yes.

19:07.790 --> 19:10.880
I've done terrible things

19:10.880 --> 19:12.620
like lied, I've run away.

19:12.620 --> 19:14.290
I even took her
to court last year.

19:14.290 --> 19:15.960
- What?

19:15.960 --> 19:18.250
- Yeah. It's like
no matter what I did,

19:18.250 --> 19:19.880
she was always there for me.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.620
I think the reason I was
able to do all this

19:25.620 --> 19:27.420
is because I knew deep down

19:27.420 --> 19:30.170
that we would never
be separated.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.460
And that sounds so selfish.

19:32.460 --> 19:35.330
- No. That sounds like
you really love her.

19:35.330 --> 19:37.790
- (sighs) I do.

19:40.330 --> 19:41.620
I honestly don't know
what I'd do

19:41.620 --> 19:44.420
if anything ever
happened to her.

19:44.420 --> 19:47.620
- What do you mean an epilogue?

19:47.620 --> 19:52.040
- No, it's not
an epilogue, it's a...

19:52.040 --> 19:54.250
Oh, that's not the right word.

19:54.250 --> 19:55.880
My brain's Jell-0

19:55.880 --> 19:59.790
and I can't think
of the freaking...

19:59.790 --> 20:01.120
- Why are so hell-bent
on another song, baby?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.830
We got like 16.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.790
- Because we've been
dredging up the past, and its...

20:05.790 --> 20:08.580
I don't want that to be
the whole story we're telling.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.170
You know what I mean?

20:10.170 --> 20:11.960
- You sure it's not
the morphine talking?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.960
- No. (chuckles)

20:14.960 --> 20:20.620
No, it's like an after-thought,
you know, like the, um...

20:20.620 --> 20:22.250
It's like a promise
of something more.

20:22.250 --> 20:25.080
- Like a coda?

20:25.080 --> 20:29.670
- You're so smart, babe.

20:29.670 --> 20:34.380
It's just that last
little thing you hear...

20:37.080 --> 20:39.830
suddenly makes everything
make sense.

20:39.830 --> 20:43.250
That's what the song should be.

20:45.420 --> 20:48.750
What's the matter?

20:48.750 --> 20:53.500
- Nothing.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.880
You scared the hell outta me,
that's all.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.500
- You're not getting
rid of me that easy.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.540
Sing me to sleep.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.380
(plays guitar)

21:24.960 --> 21:26.670
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.330
- That breakfast
didn't look too good.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.920
So I got you girls
a couple of Smoothies and...

21:31.920 --> 21:33.170
cheeseburgers.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.710
(laughter)

21:34.710 --> 21:37.120
- Oh, it hurts when I laugh.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.750
Oh, my goodness.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.750
Well, I should probably
do the Smoothie.

21:40.750 --> 21:42.420
- All right. Smoothie, it is.

21:42.420 --> 21:44.120
- Give me the burger.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.580
- Where's Daph?

21:47.580 --> 21:50.420
- Oh, she was having
a bit of a moment.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.210
I sent Scarlett off
to go talk to her.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.210
- What happened?
- Well, you know,

21:54.210 --> 21:55.960
they've got that concert
at school tonight.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.120
And, bless her heart,

21:58.120 --> 21:59.330
she didn't want to
leave my side.

21:59.330 --> 22:00.420
She don't want to go.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.580
- Yeah, that's hard.

22:05.710 --> 22:08.790
- Hey...

22:08.790 --> 22:11.210
No concert tonight?

22:11.210 --> 22:13.830
- Nope.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.620
- What about your solo?

22:15.620 --> 22:18.210
- Louisa can sing it.

22:18.210 --> 22:19.460
- Not like you can.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.290
Don't worry.
Me and Deacon got this.

22:23.290 --> 22:25.830
You don't have to hang around.

22:25.830 --> 22:29.080
- What's the point
if my mom can't come.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.710
It's not like my dad can either.

22:33.710 --> 22:37.670
- Maddie's gonna go, isn't she?

22:37.670 --> 22:39.000
- No, she's with Clay.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.790
She doesn't care anymore.

22:43.790 --> 22:45.830
It's just my mom.

22:45.830 --> 22:47.080
My mom's the only one who cares.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.170
- Baby, baby, come here.

22:49.170 --> 22:53.250
It's okay.

22:53.250 --> 22:57.670
You're gonna be all right.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.960
I'm gonna have to set up shop,

22:59.960 --> 23:02.080
and start charging around here.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.830
- Daphne is having a meltdown.

23:05.830 --> 23:07.380
I should have just
gone back before.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.540
Come on.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.380
- There is an irregularity here.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.170
- An irregularity?

23:17.170 --> 23:19.500
- Where the fixator was
attached to your bone.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.960
You see that spot there?

23:24.710 --> 23:26.540
- It's cancer!

23:26.540 --> 23:29.580
- Juliette...

23:29.580 --> 23:32.170
- I knew it.
- It's most likely nothing.

23:32.170 --> 23:34.500
But lets get an MRI
just to make sure.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.120
- How could it be nothing
if I'm in this much pain?

23:37.120 --> 23:38.620
- Oh, there's all sorts
of unexplained pain

23:38.620 --> 23:40.250
after a major surgery
like yours.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.000
Sometimes it's just
the nerve endings

23:42.000 --> 23:43.250
repairing themselves.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.830
Sometimes it's psychological.

23:45.830 --> 23:48.500
- Oh, you think I'm crazy too?

23:50.120 --> 23:51.830
- All I'm saying is
we may not be able

23:51.830 --> 23:53.040
to pinpoint it
at the end of the day.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.170
So you might just have to
push through it.

24:04.830 --> 24:07.540
- Hey. What are you doing here?

24:07.540 --> 24:09.380
- Just brought you some coffee.

24:09.380 --> 24:11.000
I wanted to see how
everybody's doing.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.460
- Thanks.

24:12.460 --> 24:13.880
Daphne had a pretty
rough spell earlier.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.040
But I think she's okay now.

24:21.830 --> 24:25.120
- You realize I'm
kind of screwed here.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.750
- How so?

24:26.750 --> 24:30.500
- If I put foot down
and tell you not to see him,

24:30.500 --> 24:32.710
you'll just resent me.

24:32.710 --> 24:34.830
And if I turn my cheek
and look the other way,

24:34.830 --> 24:38.120
you might just be fool enough
to run off with the guy.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.790
- I really can't talk
about this right now.

24:39.790 --> 24:41.920
- I mean, I couldn't blame you.

24:41.920 --> 24:46.290
He's completely charming
in a blowhard kind of way.

24:46.290 --> 24:48.210
I mean, I'd date him if I wasn't
already in love with somebody.

24:48.210 --> 24:50.620
- Please keep your voice down.

24:54.290 --> 24:55.670
- What am I supposed to do,
Scarlett,

24:55.670 --> 24:57.120
to win your trust back?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.290
Do I follow you around
like a puppy?

24:59.290 --> 25:01.750
Do I challenge the guy
to a duel?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.210
Because I'll do it, Scarlett,

25:03.210 --> 25:04.460
if that's what you want!

25:04.460 --> 25:05.790
I'll do anything!

25:05.790 --> 25:07.790
Just tell me what
you want me to do.

25:07.790 --> 25:10.170
- I don't know.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.250
- I like what we have.

25:16.250 --> 25:20.290
I just think it might
need a tag or something.

25:20.290 --> 25:21.830
- What is a tag?

25:26.040 --> 25:29.830
- What are you doing here?

25:29.830 --> 25:33.080
- Just watching you.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.830
I have been all along.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.830
- You have?

25:37.830 --> 25:43.580
- A magnificent woman
you've become.

25:43.580 --> 25:45.500
This gives me such a thrill.

25:45.500 --> 25:49.040
- I've really missed you.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.710
- I know.

25:51.710 --> 25:56.040
I've missed you too.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.880
But I don't want to interrupt.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.250
You were looking for something.

26:01.250 --> 26:03.080
- A tag.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.500
It's my least favorite
thing to write.

26:06.500 --> 26:09.580
- Maybe you don't need one.

26:09.580 --> 26:12.170
- What do you mean?

26:12.170 --> 26:14.920
- Maybe this song is finished.

26:16.420 --> 26:18.000
- Who you talking to, baby?

26:20.380 --> 26:23.750
- Oh...

26:23.750 --> 26:28.880
she was just here.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.790
- Who was, sweetie?

26:30.790 --> 26:34.210
- My mom.

26:34.210 --> 26:38.040
She was helping me
with our song.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.620
- Her mama was helping
her with the...

26:45.620 --> 26:47.500
- Yes! Yes, Scarlett.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.880
I'm telling you, it was spooky.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.170
The way she said it,
it was like...

26:53.170 --> 26:56.250
freaked me out.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.620
- I checked her out
pretty thoroughly.

26:57.620 --> 27:00.040
And everything appears
to be normal.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.710
- Listen, you're sure?

27:02.710 --> 27:04.040
- She's on a lot of pain meds.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.500
And I can dial those down a bit.

27:05.500 --> 27:09.120
But cognitive stuff like this
is not unusual.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.670
These are opioids
we're talking about.

27:12.670 --> 27:15.120
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...

27:15.120 --> 27:18.210
You hear stories
about white light.

27:18.210 --> 27:20.500
And people calling
from beyond and all that.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.920
And I just got a little nervous,
that's all.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.000
- I get it,
but she's doing great.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.170
I'll check back later, okay?

27:28.170 --> 27:30.120
- Thank you. Sorry.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.170
- See?
- Yeah.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.620
- Hey. Can I get you anything?

27:49.620 --> 27:52.460
- Oh, you're so sweet.

27:52.460 --> 27:54.960
Deacon and I were just talking
about how sweet you are.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.420
- Oh, dear.

27:56.420 --> 27:58.380
- Especially with the girls.
Thank you.

27:58.380 --> 28:00.540
- Well, they're easy
to be sweet to.

28:02.460 --> 28:03.960
Did you finish your song?

28:03.960 --> 28:05.420
- Do you ever really
finish a song?

28:05.420 --> 28:07.710
- Good point.

28:07.710 --> 28:09.080
Well, I wish Gunnar and I
could churn them out

28:09.080 --> 28:11.000
like you and Deacon do.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.580
All we seem to do lately
is tick each other off, so...

28:14.580 --> 28:16.080
- What about, um...

28:16.080 --> 28:17.620
what's that fella's name?

28:17.620 --> 28:19.500
- Oh, Damien?

28:19.500 --> 28:21.040
- Damien. Is he still
in the picture?

28:21.040 --> 28:23.620
- We do not have to
talk about that right now.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.120
- I got nothing better to do.

28:27.540 --> 28:32.040
- Well, I'm intrigued by him.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.710
I really am.

28:34.710 --> 28:37.880
I'd like to get
to know him better.

28:37.880 --> 28:42.170
But then Gunnar
looks so miserable.

28:42.170 --> 28:46.540
And says things like
he's going to fight for me.

28:46.540 --> 28:51.120
And I'm lost all over again.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.040
- Just 'cause he's miserable

28:53.040 --> 28:55.580
and he says he's
gonna fight for you

28:55.580 --> 28:57.540
doesn't mean he's
the one for you.

28:57.540 --> 29:00.830
- What do you mean?

29:00.830 --> 29:03.580
- I was talking about this
with Maddie the other day.

29:03.580 --> 29:06.710
I think sometimes these women,
you know, in relationships,

29:06.710 --> 29:10.040
we let ourselves be
the object or something.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.000
You know, man says
that he loves you.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.540
Well, and that's it.
That's love.

29:14.540 --> 29:18.250
Like he gets to choose.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.330
But we get to choose too.

29:21.330 --> 29:24.500
We get to choose to be happy

29:24.500 --> 29:27.290
'cause we deserve it.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.000
This is how I used to
get you to nap

29:38.000 --> 29:40.290
on tour buses
when you were a baby.

29:40.290 --> 29:41.960
It was the only way
I could you to sleep.

29:41.960 --> 29:45.250
- Really?
- Um-hm.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.790
Although, who am I kidding?

29:46.790 --> 29:48.960
It was the only way
I could get me to sleep.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.830
- What about dad?

29:51.830 --> 29:55.460
- Your father got
carsick on buses.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.080
That's why he never
traveled with us.

29:59.420 --> 30:02.580
I learned that the hard way
on our honeymoon.

30:02.580 --> 30:05.580
That was not pretty.

30:08.210 --> 30:10.500
You sure you don't want to go
to this thing tonight?

30:10.500 --> 30:12.330
- Yes. It's a stupid concert.

30:12.330 --> 30:15.500
- Don't say that.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.710
Don't ever say that, okay?

30:17.710 --> 30:20.790
You have a gift, honey.

30:20.790 --> 30:23.540
It's your privilege,
it's your responsibility

30:23.540 --> 30:26.290
to share that with people.

30:26.290 --> 30:29.210
And as your mom,

30:29.210 --> 30:31.250
there's nothing that
gives me greater joy

30:31.250 --> 30:34.540
than watching you do that.

30:34.540 --> 30:37.670
- Okay, geez.

30:37.670 --> 30:42.330
- Okay, geez.
Sorry, I love you.

30:42.330 --> 30:45.170
- I love you too.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.250
- You know who else loves you?

30:47.250 --> 30:48.750
- Who?

30:48.750 --> 30:52.580
- Deacon.

30:52.580 --> 30:56.290
I know you haven't
always believed that.

30:56.290 --> 30:58.120
But I hope you
believe it now, D.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.750
'Cause not just for you,
but for him too.

31:00.750 --> 31:05.710
Y'all need to know that
you can rely on each other.

31:05.710 --> 31:09.000
- Mom...
- All right.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.420
Fine...I will shut up.

31:21.580 --> 31:25.620
- Daphne!
- What are you guys doing here?

31:25.620 --> 31:28.290
- We decided if y'all couldn't
come to the concert,

31:28.290 --> 31:29.620
we'd bring the concert to you.

31:29.620 --> 31:30.540
- No way.

31:30.540 --> 31:31.750
- I wish I could
take the credit.

31:31.750 --> 31:33.500
But it was Flynn's idea.

- Can I get a doctor, please?

32:43.460 --> 32:46.580
Get a doctor in here!
Please hurry!

32:46.580 --> 32:47.750
I'm so sorry.
Come on guys.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.080
We got you...
We got you.

32:54.670 --> 32:57.920
- We need a crash cart in here!

32:57.920 --> 33:00.250
(car horns honking)

33:00.250 --> 33:02.620
- This is a nightmare!

33:02.620 --> 33:04.080
- I can't believe
there's a game today.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.290
- Can we just get
off the street?

33:05.290 --> 33:06.380
- I don't see how.

33:06.380 --> 33:10.040
(text message rings)

33:10.040 --> 33:11.210
- Oh, no.
- What?

33:11.210 --> 33:14.250
- They're taking
my mom into ICU.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.540
My dad says come now.
Oh, my God!

33:17.540 --> 33:19.790
Why didn't I just stay
there last night?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.000
What was I thinking?

33:23.120 --> 33:24.500
- Wait. Where you going?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
- Sorry. I got to go.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.670
- Why don't you
take this jacket?

33:37.290 --> 33:38.830
- I don't understand.
What is going on right now?

33:38.830 --> 33:39.790
- Her kidneys are shutting down.

33:39.790 --> 33:40.920
And her potassium is sky high.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.330
We're giving her medication.

33:42.330 --> 33:43.670
But we may have to
put her on dialysis.

33:43.670 --> 33:44.880
- No, that doesn't
make any sense!

33:44.880 --> 33:46.000
She has a broken pelvis!
That's--

33:46.000 --> 33:47.380
- That can happen with
the type of fracture

33:47.380 --> 33:48.330
that your wife sustained.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.380
graft tissue from
the bone marrow

33:49.380 --> 33:50.790
can leak into the blood system.

33:50.790 --> 33:52.330
And just start wreaking
havoc through the body.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.500
- You can do something, right?
You'll fix that?

33:53.500 --> 33:54.960
- Not a lot, unfortunately.

33:54.960 --> 33:55.880
We just try to stabilize her.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.420
And wait for the circulation
to clear on its own.

33:57.420 --> 33:58.710
- And if it doesn't?

33:58.710 --> 34:00.670
- Let's not go there right now.
We're gonna do everything we can

34:00.670 --> 34:02.120
to make sure she
pulls through this.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.710
- I'm sorry.
I can't let you back here.

34:37.830 --> 34:40.040
- Doctor?

34:40.040 --> 34:41.750
- Be right back.

35:08.750 --> 35:11.330
- You'll have to stop
scaring me like that.

35:11.330 --> 35:14.960
- What's happening?

35:14.960 --> 35:17.380
- I don't know, sweetie.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.000
- If something happens,

35:26.000 --> 35:29.710
you gotta stay strong
for the girls.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.750
Promise me.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.380
- I can't promise that

35:34.380 --> 35:35.880
'cause you ain't going nowhere.

35:39.330 --> 35:41.790
- Just promise me.

35:44.500 --> 35:47.540
- Sir, you cannot be in here.
- I promise. I promise, okay?

35:49.670 --> 35:53.120
Please, all right, okay.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.960
- I love you, Deacon.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.120
- I love you, Rayna.

36:10.830 --> 36:14.750
Don't leave me.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.920
- I'm sorry.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.960
- Don't!

36:28.080 --> 36:29.420
- I'm so sorry, sir.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.330
- Your leg looks like
it's healed nicely.

36:33.330 --> 36:35.250
You should be able to put
weight on it, no problem.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.330
- Well, what about
the irregularity?

36:37.330 --> 36:39.330
- Well, that was just
some calcification

36:39.330 --> 36:41.040
at the site of the pin.
But nothing to worry about.

36:44.460 --> 36:45.580
- I'm sorry to interrupt you,
Dr. Reynolds.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.120
But you're wanted in the ICU.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.830
- I'm just finishing up here.
Can it wait?

36:48.830 --> 36:52.040
- Um, your trauma patient
from last night?

36:52.040 --> 36:53.790
That was in the car accident?
- Yeah?

36:53.790 --> 36:56.420
- She's crashing in the ICU.

36:56.420 --> 36:57.790
- I'm sorry.
We'll have to cut this short.

36:57.790 --> 36:59.500
I hope you understand.
- Of course.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.620
- She's talking about Rayna.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.960
- She has had multiple emboli

37:09.960 --> 37:12.080
that have affected her organs.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.830
The system usually
clears on its own.

37:13.830 --> 37:16.710
But, unfortunately, your wife's
just not responding.

37:16.710 --> 37:18.830
- What does that mean?

37:18.830 --> 37:21.000
- We are artificially
supporting her blood pressure

37:21.000 --> 37:22.790
at this point.

37:22.790 --> 37:24.420
And her organs are failing.

37:26.250 --> 37:29.420
- I'm sorry.
I wish we had better news.

37:29.420 --> 37:31.420
- Is mom dying?

37:34.290 --> 37:36.460
- We are doing everything
that we can.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.920
I usually tell folks
to pray for the best.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.960
And prepare for the worst.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.710
But I promise we will
do everything we can

37:46.710 --> 37:48.080
to help her pull through.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.620
- No! Please no!

37:49.620 --> 37:52.170
- Come here, Daphne.
Come here.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.460
- Juliette! Slow down!

38:07.920 --> 38:09.210
What's wrong?

38:25.460 --> 38:27.420
- Any word from Maddie?
- She's almost here.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.670
- Deacon?

38:38.960 --> 38:41.210
- It's not good.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.000
- All I ever wanted was
for you to be proud of me.

39:07.710 --> 39:10.710
- Mom?

39:10.710 --> 39:13.250
I'm here, mom.
Mom, I'm here.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.420
Mom, I'm so sorry.

39:14.420 --> 39:17.790
- Hush, baby.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.460
She's always known, sweetie.
She knows that.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.290
Is there anything else
you can do here, please?

39:25.290 --> 39:28.540
- We're doing everything we can.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.290
- Dad?

39:40.290 --> 39:43.670
- Yes, sweet girl?

39:43.670 --> 39:45.250
- Do you think
she knows we're here?

39:47.710 --> 39:51.460
- I do.

39:51.460 --> 39:54.580
Is there something
you want to say to her?

39:54.580 --> 39:57.000
- I don't know what to say.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.620
- That's okay, honey.

39:59.620 --> 40:02.750
That's all right.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.000
It's hard to know what to say.
