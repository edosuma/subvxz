00:02.044 --> 00:03.500
Previously on "Teen Wolf:"

00:03.671 --> 00:05.582
Lydia, what's it gonna take
to get you to open up?

00:05.756 --> 00:07.712
Could I give you a flower?

00:07.884 --> 00:09.875
Promise to keep it?

00:10.094 --> 00:11.425
I wanted to kiss you.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.802
- When's the Kanima not the Kanima?
- When it's Jackson.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.342
Someone's not protecting him.

00:19.604 --> 00:20.969
Someone's controlling him.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.825
You promised this was only
gonna be for a few weeks.

00:36.996 --> 00:40.159
Look, just because we're in a trailer
does not mean we're trailer park trash.

00:40.333 --> 00:41.994
Exactly. We're worse.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.498
We don't even have enough money
to be in a trailer park.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.510
Don't have a meltdown, okay?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.459
It's probably just the generator.

00:53.638 --> 00:57.426
You mean the thing
that runs the electricity and water.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.481
I'm sorry.

01:06.984 --> 01:10.727
I'm just tired of feeling
slightly terrified all the time.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.610
It's not like I wanna be.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.748
Hey, look, it's going to get better.

01:48.359 --> 01:49.519
Sean?

03:32.922 --> 03:34.913
No!

04:13.087 --> 04:14.748
|f Jackson doesn't know
what he's doing,

04:14.922 --> 04:17.914
then he probably doesn't know
that someone's controlling him.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.172
Or he doesn't remember.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.844
What if it's the same kind of thing
that happened with Lydia

04:21.053 --> 04:22.338
when she took off from the hospital?

04:22.555 --> 04:23.419
A fugue state.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.095
He'd have to forget everything.
The murder.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.301
Getting rid of the blood.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.398
But he had help
with one thing though, the video.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.352
Maybe someone else helped
him forget that.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.357
Whoever's controlling him.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.568
Are you sure Jackson
has no clue about any of this?

04:43.743 --> 04:45.108
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf

04:45.286 --> 04:47.447
and that being with Lydia
somehow delayed the whole thing.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.824
So do we try
to convince him he's not?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.326
If it helps us find out who's
controlling him, then yeah.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.499
Do you think he'll talk to us
after what we did?

04:54.670 --> 04:56.706
Yeah, it's us. He'll talk to us.

04:56.881 --> 04:57.836
Right?

04:58.007 --> 05:01.716
You will not go within 50 feet
of Jackson Whittemore.

05:01.927 --> 05:05.340
You will not speak to him.
You will not approach him.

05:05.556 --> 05:10.550
You will not assault or harass him
physically or psychologically.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.225
What about school?

05:19.403 --> 05:22.566
You can attend classes while attempting
to maintain a 50-foot distance.

05:22.782 --> 05:26.115
Okay, what if we both have to
use the bathroom at the same time

05:26.285 --> 05:30.028
and there's only two stalls available
and they're only right next to each other?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.831
I'll just hold it.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.203
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are
that they're not pressing charges?

05:39.381 --> 05:40.996
- Come on, it was just a joke.
- A joke?

05:41.175 --> 05:42.756
Yes, I didn't think
it would be taken that seriously.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.134
Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?

05:45.304 --> 05:48.512
I mean, we're talking multiple levels
of interpretation here.

05:49.809 --> 05:53.301
Okay, well, how exactly
am I supposed to interpret

05:53.521 --> 05:55.807
the stolen prison transport van, huh?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.309
- We filled the tank!
- Move!

06:03.155 --> 06:04.736
It's notjust this.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.023
Although, a restraining order
is a new low

06:07.201 --> 06:09.658
that I didn't think that you would reach
quite this soon.

06:09.829 --> 06:11.569
It's everything on top of it.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.365
The completely bizarre behavior,
the late nights coming home,

06:15.584 --> 06:17.495
having to beg Mr. Harris for you

06:17.670 --> 06:19.581
to make up that chemistry test
that you missed.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.374
I missed a chemistry test?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.501
Really, Scott? Really?

06:24.301 --> 06:27.134
l have to ground you. I am grounding you.
You are grounded.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.426
What about work?

06:28.639 --> 06:30.880
Fine. Other than work.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.306
And no TV.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.015
The TV's broken.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.684
Then no computer.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.854
- I need the computer for school.
- Then no...

06:40.109 --> 06:41.349
No Stiles.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.064
- What... No Stiles?
- No Stiles!

06:44.655 --> 06:47.442
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.815
Give 'em to me!

06:55.207 --> 06:56.413
For the love of God.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.790
- Mom, do you want me to...
- No.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.452
Mom, come on, let me just... Mom.

07:01.630 --> 07:02.881
Mom!

07:06.719 --> 07:08.755
What is going on with you?

07:08.971 --> 07:10.927
Is this about Allison?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.145
Do you really wanna know?

07:20.399 --> 07:21.684
Yeah.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.729
Is this about your father?

07:30.409 --> 07:31.990
It is, isn't it?

07:33.829 --> 07:38.072
Okay, you know what...
We'll talk about this at home.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.290
I'm gonna go get the car.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.378
I'm the worst son ever.

07:48.594 --> 07:51.336
Well, I'm not exactly
winning any prizes either.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.513
Damn it! You give him a restraining order,
and he's mocking you!

07:54.683 --> 07:56.514
He was..."And what do I do
about going to the bathroom"?

07:56.727 --> 07:58.558
What the hell is this?!

08:10.407 --> 08:12.147
So why do we need their help?

08:12.326 --> 08:15.159
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
And I still don't know who it is.

08:15.371 --> 08:16.952
And they do?

08:17.122 --> 08:18.111
They might.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.282
Which is why I need one of you
to get on their good side.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.414
Hmm, Scott or Stiles?

08:26.882 --> 08:29.840
- Either.
- You know, the full moon's coming, Derek.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.509
I'm aware of that.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.681
My, these look comfortable.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.102
You said you were gonna teach us
to change whenever we wanted.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.857
There hasn't been time.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.815
But if you have to lock us up
during the full moon,

08:50.990 --> 08:53.572
that means you're alone
against the Argents.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.449
They haven't found us.

08:55.661 --> 08:56.696
Yet!

08:57.621 --> 08:59.407
So how about we forget the Kanima?

08:59.623 --> 09:00.999
We can't!

09:03.919 --> 09:07.832
But there was something about the way
Gerard looked at it.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.587
He wasn't afraid...

09:13.679 --> 09:15.010
At all.

09:16.348 --> 09:19.340
I don't know what he knows
or what he's planning.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.178
But I'm sure about one thing.
We have to find it first.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.753
It's everything
Lydia can translate.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.418
And trust me,
she was very confused.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.425
Yeah, what'd you tell her?

09:58.640 --> 10:01.222
That we were part of
an online gaming community

10:01.435 --> 10:03.471
that battles mythical creatures.

10:04.188 --> 10:08.727
I am part of an online gaming community
that battles mythical creatures.

10:09.026 --> 10:09.981
Oh.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.893
Great.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.398
Okay, does it say how to find out
who's controlling him?

10:14.615 --> 10:16.731
Not really.
But Stiles was right about the murderers.

10:16.950 --> 10:17.780
Yes!

10:17.993 --> 10:19.904
It calls the Kanima
a weapon of vengeance.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.453
There's a story in there
about this South American priest

10:23.665 --> 10:26.748
who uses the Kanima
to execute murderers in his village.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.746
All right, see?
So maybe it's not all that bad.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.204
Until the bond grew strong enough
that it killed whoever he wanted it to.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.665
All bad, all very, very bad.

10:34.885 --> 10:35.965
Here's the thing, though.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.464
The Kanima's actually supposed
to be a werewolf.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.511
But it can't be...

10:40.724 --> 10:43.966
"Until it resolves that in its past
which manifested it."

10:44.978 --> 10:47.765
Okay, if that means that Jackson could use
a few thousand hours of therapy,

10:47.981 --> 10:50.267
I could've told you that myself.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.476
What if it has something
to do with his parents?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.191
His real parents.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.782
Yeah, does anybody actually
know what happened to them?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.325
Lydia might.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.823
What if she doesn't know anything?

11:04.039 --> 11:06.655
Well, he doesn't have
a restraining order against me,

11:06.875 --> 11:08.490
so I'll talk to him myself.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.709
Okay, what do I do?

11:11.046 --> 11:13.628
You have a make-up exam, remember?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.421
Promise me.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.971
If he does anything,
you run the other way.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.473
I can take care of myself.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.310
Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy
with some stupid test,

11:28.522 --> 11:30.683
someone's going to need
to take care of me.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.151
- If he does anything...
- Like?

11:33.360 --> 11:36.818
Anything weird or bizarre... Anything.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.611
Anything evil!

12:51.730 --> 12:52.890
Jackson?

12:54.316 --> 12:57.023
Did you still want to discuss your paper?

13:10.249 --> 13:11.989
You have one hour, Mr. McCall.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.415
Begin.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.753
Really, Scott?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.691
I can't.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.651
I gotta do this.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.569
I gotta do this.
No, I am gonna go to work.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.693
I am gonna go to work.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.826
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a little bit.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.487
Just a tad.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.665
He won't even know I was here.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.874
You just scared the hell out of me.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.915
Sorry, I... l was just, I was... Nothing.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.213
That's a... Nice heels.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.838
Yeah, my feet were hurting, so I...

15:33.433 --> 15:34.889
Same reason I never wear mine.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.391
- What?
- Uh, forget it.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.515
Hey, did you hear about
the underground show?

15:39.731 --> 15:42.017
Apparently, they've got
some big name spinning.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.065
You mean like a rave?

15:44.236 --> 15:46.978
Is it still a rave if you don't roll?
ljust call it a party.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.238
But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up
with tickets if you're down.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.736
- Want me to get you one?
- Yeah. Yeah, great.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.944
Yeah? All right, cool.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.781
It's Friday, so... Looking forward to it.

15:59.000 --> 15:59.989
Yeah.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.457
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.713
Come on, anyone who ever says,
"I'm not supposed to tell anyone"

16:10.929 --> 16:13.261
is always dying to
tell someone, so tell me!

16:13.473 --> 16:15.509
- Why do you wanna know?
- I can't tell you that.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.761
Then I'm not telling you.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.639
But you are telling me
that you could tell me something

16:19.855 --> 16:21.766
if you wanted to tell me?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.768
Was that a question?

16:23.984 --> 16:25.599
It felt like a question.
I think.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.856
Well, tell me if this feels like an answer.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.187
No.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.114
Jackson?

16:42.127 --> 16:43.287
In here.

16:59.269 --> 17:02.011
- Is something wrong?
- You could've warned me.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.974
You're the one that walked
into the boys' locker room.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.277
I thought I heard you... Forget it.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.772
Did you wanna talk about something?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.857
- We can talk later.
- No.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.902
Let's talk now.

17:19.498 --> 17:20.863
Lydia!

17:21.541 --> 17:23.497
Lydia, come on! Wait!

17:24.836 --> 17:25.825
Hey, Erica.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.837
Why are you asking Lydia
about Jackson's real parents?

17:29.049 --> 17:31.631
Why are you bringing out
the claws on camera?

17:34.221 --> 17:36.633
That's right.
You wanna play Catwoman?

17:36.848 --> 17:38.839
I'll be your Batman.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.890
If you're wondering about
Jackson's real parents,

17:41.102 --> 17:43.309
they're about half a mile from here.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.064
In Beacon Hills Cemetery.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.607
l... l have to get to class.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.855
No, no, you don't.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.363
No, you have perfect grades.
You can skip one class.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.660
Are you okay?

18:01.081 --> 18:02.946
Your heart's beating like crazy.

18:21.810 --> 18:22.925
Allison.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.648
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.111
- Do you know how they died?
- Maybe.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.062
If you tell me why you're so interested.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.489
It's him, isn't it?

18:41.705 --> 18:43.741
What? Who? Him who?

18:45.500 --> 18:48.492
The test didn't work, but it's still him.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.869
It's Jackson.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.840
What do you think you're doing?

18:56.428 --> 18:57.759
The hour's up.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.383
You're not leaving till every single
one of these bubbles is filled in.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.265
I thought you wanted to talk.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.522
l... l... I changed my mind.

19:16.906 --> 19:20.069
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.866
Is it Scott? Is it that whole thing?

19:26.708 --> 19:29.199
I still can't believe you actually think

19:29.419 --> 19:32.582
your little Romeo and Juliet story
is gonna last.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.708
You know he's eventually
just gonna run to Derek

19:34.924 --> 19:37.415
and join up with him and
his little wolf pack.

19:37.761 --> 19:41.845
If you don't realize that, then you gotta be
the stupidest bitch in this town.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.427
Well, other than Scott
since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.099
Stop it. Just stop!

19:46.311 --> 19:48.848
What are you gonna do, Allison?

19:49.481 --> 19:52.894
When your stupid bitch of a boyfriend
turns on you?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.813
They killed your aunt.
They almost killed Lydia.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.861
Who do you really think is gonna be next?

19:59.074 --> 20:00.314
Not you.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.694
No, no, it can't be you,
because you're in love.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.617
Is that what you tell yourself?

20:04.829 --> 20:07.696
"Scott's different and everything's
gonna work out because we're in love."

20:07.916 --> 20:11.374
Well, if that's what you believe,
then you're already dead.

20:15.757 --> 20:16.712
| just...

20:16.925 --> 20:20.713
| just hope your dad has been teaching you
moves to protect yourself.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.757
Actually, he has.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.760
Allison?

20:30.605 --> 20:31.845
What are you doing here?

20:34.943 --> 20:36.558
I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.113
Scott... Scott, I'm fine. Scott, I'm fine!

20:39.322 --> 20:40.402
Scott!

20:42.117 --> 20:43.982
l have a restraining order!

20:44.160 --> 20:46.902
Trust me, I restrained myself.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.910
You can't tell Derek, okay?

21:37.130 --> 21:39.416
There's a lot more to this
that you don't know about.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.252
And just because you got
the Alpha bite makeover

21:41.468 --> 21:43.333
doesn't give you a license to go
around destroying people.

21:43.553 --> 21:44.633
Why not?

21:44.846 --> 21:46.586
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.

21:47.015 --> 21:50.883
I used to have
the worst crush in the world on you.

21:51.561 --> 21:52.971
Yeah, you, Stiles.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.887
And you never once even noticed me.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.974
Exactly how you're not
noticing me right now.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.319
Guys!

22:10.955 --> 22:12.331
What the hell's going on?

22:13.625 --> 22:14.831
Hey! Enough!

22:15.043 --> 22:16.283
Enough.

22:21.549 --> 22:25.167
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson! Calm down!

22:26.596 --> 22:29.463
Mr. McCall,
you wanna explain yourself?

22:29.808 --> 22:30.797
Stilinski!

22:34.562 --> 22:36.063
You dropped this.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.352
You and you...

22:41.110 --> 22:44.022
Actually, all of you...

22:45.156 --> 22:47.112
Detention. 3:00.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.120
Hi, there.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.001
Oh, I'll make an announcement,
have Scott brought to the office.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.047
Actually, I came here to talk to you.

23:04.634 --> 23:05.874
Me?

23:08.388 --> 23:10.754
- Busy after school?
- Always.

23:10.974 --> 23:12.930
Well, unbusy yourself.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.224
I wanna talk to you.

23:15.436 --> 23:18.803
Actually, I want to show you something.

23:20.984 --> 23:24.602
I thought we'd gotten past
the slightly rapey language.

23:24.946 --> 23:28.154
And bring your flower.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.879
We can't be in detention together.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.083
I have a restraining order
against these tools.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.463
All of these tools?

23:49.679 --> 23:51.260
No, just us tools.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.055
Fine. You two, over there.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.556
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, you're not.

24:03.735 --> 24:05.191
You're going to find out
who's controlling him

24:05.403 --> 24:06.939
and then you're gonna help save him.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.353
No. You were right, let's kill him.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.565
No.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.616
"Kanima."

24:23.880 --> 24:26.542
l was under the impression
they were no longer dating.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.507
Me too, but it looks like they are.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.044
And more.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.137
A lot more.

24:34.349 --> 24:37.056
How do you know it's not some
other impressionable young girl

24:37.268 --> 24:39.099
with severely low standards?

24:40.563 --> 24:42.269
Because I know Scott.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.065
And Allison is the only one that
he's ever talked about like that.

24:47.737 --> 24:50.399
ljust wanna make sure
they continue to be safe.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.235
I couldn't agree more.

24:54.619 --> 24:55.734
Hey.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.490
What if it's Matt?

24:57.997 --> 25:00.739
I mean, this whole thing
comes back to the video, right?

25:00.959 --> 25:03.746
Danny said that Matt was the one who
found the two hours of footage missing.

25:03.962 --> 25:04.826
Exactly!

25:05.046 --> 25:07.287
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.629
So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad,

25:12.845 --> 25:14.881
one of Argent's hunters,
and the mechanic working on yourjeep?

25:15.098 --> 25:16.463
- Yes!
- Why?

25:16.724 --> 25:18.009
Because...

25:19.060 --> 25:20.641
He's evil.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.770
- You just don't like him.
- The guy bugs me.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.223
I don't know what it is.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.478
Just look at his face.

25:31.239 --> 25:32.945
Any other theories?

25:39.789 --> 25:41.120
You okay?

25:42.333 --> 25:44.574
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Are you all right?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.415
- Hey, you don't look so good.
- I just need to get some water.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.720
No one leaves their seats.

26:00.685 --> 26:03.097
Stiles says you know how
Jackson's parents died.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.563
Maybe.

26:04.772 --> 26:05.807
Talk.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.815
It was a car accident.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.689
My dad was the insurance investigator,

26:11.904 --> 26:14.031
and every time he sees Jackson
drive by in his Porsche,

26:14.198 --> 26:17.281
he makes some comment about the huge
settlement he'll be getting when he's 18.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.985
So not only is Jackson rich now,
but he's getting even richer at 18?

26:21.205 --> 26:21.910
Yep.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.330
There's something
so deeply wrong with that.

26:25.793 --> 26:26.999
You know what?

26:27.170 --> 26:29.661
I could try to find the insurance
report in my dad's inbox.

26:29.881 --> 26:31.542
He keeps everything.

26:32.842 --> 26:35.208
Scott McCall, please
report to the principal's office.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.719
- Jackson!
- I'm fine, just give me a minute.

27:38.908 --> 27:39.943
Peﬂect

28:21.742 --> 28:22.822
Look at the dates.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.991
"Passengers arrived
at the hospital DOA.

28:25.246 --> 28:29.706
"The estimated time of death
9:26 pm, June 14, 1995."

28:29.917 --> 28:32.203
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.634
Oh. No, I'm sorry.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.227
Yes, I'm leaving.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.520
But none of you are.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.610
You may go
when you're done with the re-shelving.

28:58.321 --> 29:00.653
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

29:12.043 --> 29:14.079
The principal wanted to see me?

29:15.129 --> 29:17.040
No. I did.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.877
I'm concerned about the detention today.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.221
A sink was ripped off the wall.

29:31.687 --> 29:35.430
You're lucky I'm here to explain
that to people somehow.

29:35.650 --> 29:36.810
You realize that?

29:37.026 --> 29:38.732
Yeah. I do now.

29:39.153 --> 29:40.188
Good.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.861
Are you having sex
with my daughter?

29:54.669 --> 29:58.002
No. I'm not having sex
with your daughter.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.005
I certainly hope not.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.158
Hello?

30:51.851 --> 30:55.059
It means he was born
after his mom died by c-section.

30:55.271 --> 30:57.637
They had to pull him out
of her dead body.

31:05.448 --> 31:06.858
You okay, dude?

31:11.412 --> 31:13.653
So was it an accident or not?

31:13.956 --> 31:16.242
The word all over the report
is "inconclusive."

31:16.792 --> 31:19.078
Then his parents could
have been murdered?

31:19.295 --> 31:21.832
If they were, then it falls
in line with the Kanima myth.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.790
You know? It seeks out
and kills murderers.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.584
But for Jackson?
Or for the person controlling him?

31:53.913 --> 31:56.074
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.203
He's not gonna...

32:17.144 --> 32:18.224
Erica!

33:31.218 --> 33:32.207
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

33:34.847 --> 33:36.462
I think she's having a seizure.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.560
He's alive.

33:43.772 --> 33:44.978
Hey, we need to get her to a hospital.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.682
Derek, only to Derek.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.777
- When we get her to the hospital...
- To Derek.

33:51.989 --> 33:52.978
To Derek.

33:53.491 --> 33:54.446
Go.

33:56.869 --> 33:57.904
Hey, Scott!

33:58.787 --> 34:01.779
- I'm staying here with you.
- He can't take her alone. Not like this.

34:01.999 --> 34:04.365
And Matt... I've got to call
an ambulance for him, just go.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.868
- This doesn't feel right.
- It's okay.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.499
No, it's not. No, it's not right.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.211
It doesn't... It doesn't mean anything.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.887
- But it feels like it does.
- Scott, go.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.380
Go.

34:21.727 --> 34:22.807
Okay.

34:37.785 --> 34:38.991
Hello?

34:51.257 --> 34:52.838
Over here.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.882
Is this your house?

34:58.889 --> 35:00.129
It was.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.976
I'll tell you all about it.

35:04.061 --> 35:07.645
But first, did you bring the flower?

35:10.192 --> 35:11.978
I couldn't find it.

35:13.237 --> 35:14.727
That's okay.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.405
But since you don't have it,

35:19.159 --> 35:20.865
I'm gonna need that kiss.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.827
Is something wrong?

36:16.550 --> 36:17.881
Pull her up.

36:20.387 --> 36:21.888
Is she dying?

36:22.181 --> 36:25.639
She might, I...
Which is why this is gonna hurt.

36:27.144 --> 36:28.725
A broken arm?!

36:29.772 --> 36:31.683
It'll trigger the healing process.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.309
I still gotta get the venom out.

36:33.484 --> 36:35.224
This is where it's really gonna hurt.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.869
Stiles...

36:49.166 --> 36:50.997
You make a good Batman.

36:54.797 --> 36:56.082
Oh, my God.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.339
You know who it is.

37:14.775 --> 37:15.981
Jackson.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.684
You just wanted Erica
to confirm it, didn't you?

37:21.990 --> 37:25.403
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.

37:28.247 --> 37:31.956
If you want me in, fine.
But we'll do it on one condition.

37:32.376 --> 37:34.788
We're gonna catch him, not kill him.

37:35.045 --> 37:36.034
And?

37:38.841 --> 37:40.456
And we do it my way.

37:43.429 --> 37:46.387
Thank you, Jenna. Thanks, you guys.
I appreciate it.

37:51.729 --> 37:54.471
Please, you have to tell him.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.806
It's okay, the baby's fine.

37:57.025 --> 37:59.812
Not the baby.

38:00.946 --> 38:01.901
Okay.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.945
He killed Sean.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.901
- Honey, the police know.
- They don't...

38:09.371 --> 38:11.202
They didn't see it.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.366
It wasn't human.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.328
Okay.

38:21.258 --> 38:22.464
All right.

38:45.282 --> 38:48.319
Help me, help me, help me...

38:51.538 --> 38:54.245
Please... No...

39:11.099 --> 39:13.135
I'm so sorry, Lydia.

39:14.353 --> 39:19.143
All of this must be terribly confusing.

39:19.733 --> 39:23.146
But at least you know that
you're not actually crazy.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.485
Well, not completely.

39:25.697 --> 39:30.487
There's bound to be some residual effects,
but you're a strong girl.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.401
Personally I think
that you're gonna pull through

39:32.579 --> 39:35.446
with a minimal amount
of post-traumatic stress.

39:36.083 --> 39:41.123
Or maybe a few years of
profoundly disturbing nightmares.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.960
I had a plan, you know.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.585
It was a good plan.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.179
But if there's one thing
that I've learned in life,

39:53.350 --> 39:55.557
it's to always have a backup.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.852
That would be you.

40:01.275 --> 40:04.187
Your immunity makes you
the perfect plan B.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.234
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.

40:06.446 --> 40:12.282
But you would be able to do
one very important thing.

40:15.706 --> 40:17.742
Do you know what that is, Lydia?
