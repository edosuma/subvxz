01:36.400 --> 01:38.060
Safe!

01:44.533 --> 01:45.647
Off belay!

01:50.497 --> 01:52.739
Right, can you get my camera out,
please?

01:58.671 --> 02:00.545
Say it.

02:01.549 --> 02:03.292
- Come on.
- Don't take a picture.

02:03.384 --> 02:07.512
Give us a smile. I'm sure there's a
pretty face under that frown somewhere.

02:12.059 --> 02:15.095
- Is that the best you got?
- Afraid so.

02:15.187 --> 02:17.760
- OK, get one of me.
- No, I'll take it at the top.

02:17.856 --> 02:20.347
Yeah, but I wanna get
some of this background in.

02:20.442 --> 02:21.817
Pass it over.

02:24.446 --> 02:27.363
Try and get some of that exposure in.
Show how high up we are.

02:27.449 --> 02:29.322
Is that a golden eagle?

02:36.416 --> 02:38.040
Beautiful.

02:38.126 --> 02:40.451
It's a golden eagle.
Buzzard. I don't know

02:40.545 --> 02:42.870
Nah, it's way too big to be a buzzard.

02:50.763 --> 02:54.428
Alright, that's enough of the bird.
Point the camera at the money.

02:55.434 --> 02:56.928
Alison, come on.

02:58.604 --> 03:00.513
- Stop pouting.
- What?

03:01.940 --> 03:03.731
It was a golden eagle.

03:48.943 --> 03:51.648
- Alison! Help me!
- Ed!

03:53.740 --> 03:55.198
Jesus Christ, Alison!

03:55.867 --> 03:58.025
- Shit!
- Rob, throw the rope.

03:58.119 --> 03:59.198
- Guys!
- Alison!

03:59.287 --> 04:03.580
- Ed!
- Alison, please! It's slipping!

04:03.666 --> 04:05.326
It's gonna go!

04:09.922 --> 04:14.251
I can't... I can't...
I can't get up!

04:17.220 --> 04:19.047
- Help me!
- Rob!

04:20.390 --> 04:21.635
Rob!

04:25.311 --> 04:28.727
- Ed, just breathe!

04:28.815 --> 04:31.306
- It's not gonna hold!
- Ed! Ed!

04:31.401 --> 04:34.022
Ed, you have to listen to me.
Just breathe.

04:50.794 --> 04:53.546
It's OK, but stop moving.
Keep it together.

04:53.630 --> 04:54.958
Alright, alright.

04:55.048 --> 04:57.290
Easy. OK, OK. Get your breath.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.254
Get your breath.
Jesus Christ, what happened, guys?

05:01.930 --> 05:04.966
- Alison, are you alright?
- Don't ask. Yeah, I'm fine.

05:05.058 --> 05:08.758
Alright, mate, you're alright.
OK. Can you just pull yourself up?

05:08.853 --> 05:10.892
- Thank God.
- Alison, you OK?

05:10.980 --> 05:12.889
- I'm fine.
- Alright.

05:12.982 --> 05:15.769
It's OK, keep going.
Just get your breath.

08:01.143 --> 08:03.349
I lost my bloody camera.

08:03.937 --> 08:06.392
I feel sick
and my hands won't stop shaking.

08:06.481 --> 08:09.932
It's the adrenaline lag, mate.
Always hits you afterwards.

08:11.527 --> 08:12.808
Hey, Ed.

08:13.696 --> 08:16.697
Don't ever have a concentration lapse
like that again, OK?

08:16.782 --> 08:19.404
You wanna climb with me,
you need to up your game.

08:19.493 --> 08:22.198
Methodical, every step. I mean it.

08:22.329 --> 08:25.414
Complacency is a killer out here.

08:25.499 --> 08:27.907
- We got away with cuts and bruises.
- Yeah.

08:30.504 --> 08:32.958
Remind me why we do this again.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.673
Because we don't surf.

08:55.987 --> 08:57.362
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:57.446 --> 09:00.233
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing, honey?

09:02.117 --> 09:06.495
- What time did you get here?
- About an hour ago. Just unpacking.

09:07.414 --> 09:11.364
Yeah, we took the double room
with the en suite. If that's OK?

09:11.460 --> 09:13.452
Fine. I'm not sleeping with him, am I?

09:14.546 --> 09:16.005
Neither am I.

09:18.216 --> 09:20.256
- I'm Ed, by the way.

09:20.343 --> 09:23.261
Oh, Ed. I'm sorry, mate.
Ed, Jenny. Jenny, this is Ed.

09:23.346 --> 09:24.377
Hi, Ed.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.558
No, after you.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.271
OK?

09:40.279 --> 09:41.856
Oh, right.

09:45.742 --> 09:48.779
Oh, honey, can you bring me
the cutlery, please, babe?

09:48.870 --> 09:50.697
It's in the jug on the dresser.

09:51.707 --> 09:53.616
Smells like someone's died in here.

09:53.708 --> 09:57.042
Yeah, it is a little stinky.
I'll open a window, let some air in.

09:58.088 --> 10:00.376
That's just what Fred West
would have said.

10:00.465 --> 10:03.170
In future, you should
bury your relatives outdoors.

10:03.259 --> 10:04.588
Think patio.

10:04.677 --> 10:08.591
If we had a phone in here, mate, you
could call up the landlord and complain.

10:08.681 --> 10:10.839
- There's no phone?
- No.

10:10.933 --> 10:12.178
Great.

10:14.478 --> 10:18.143
And the window... is bust.

10:21.860 --> 10:24.102
Any joy?

10:24.196 --> 10:26.235
We've had a right result.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.561
Hey, don't worry about her.

11:02.441 --> 11:06.770
You know, with a bit of luck, she'll be
tucked up and fast asleep by now.

11:07.446 --> 11:09.901
Your parents are such a pushover.

11:09.990 --> 11:13.074
She runs rings round them.
She's such a little monkey.

11:15.286 --> 11:16.615
I miss her.

11:17.538 --> 11:19.697
It's only been two days, Jen.

11:20.708 --> 11:21.871
Hmm.

11:40.978 --> 11:42.353
Bollocks.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.831
- No, no, no!

12:13.926 --> 12:17.508
It's horrible. Girls, girls, stop.
Seriously, it's horrible.

12:17.596 --> 12:20.846
- Please, cards, go.
- OK. OK.

12:20.932 --> 12:22.308
But, erm...

12:22.392 --> 12:25.642
Right, I need to know how much
one of these fellas is worth.

12:25.729 --> 12:27.389
Five matchsticks. Er!

12:27.480 --> 12:31.525
- Er, no sex for you.

12:31.609 --> 12:36.070
- And, OK, a bottle top?
- Two pasta swirls to a top.

12:36.948 --> 12:41.241
Right. So then, ten matchsticks
makes one bottle top?

12:41.327 --> 12:42.951
Yeah.

12:43.037 --> 12:46.737
Great. OK, thanks, guys.
It's a bit confusing, is all.

12:46.832 --> 12:48.741
It really isn't.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.455
- Be nice.
- What are you doing, Jen?

12:51.587 --> 12:53.828
Ladies and gentlemen, I fold.

12:55.132 --> 12:58.382
- What have you got that's so special?
- Erm...

12:58.468 --> 13:01.884
A pasta swirl and two tops
is what I'm gonna raise by.

13:01.972 --> 13:04.130
- I fold.
- Me, too.

13:05.558 --> 13:08.808
I'm gonna keep him honest. All in.

13:10.772 --> 13:13.097
The water's warm. Jump on in.

13:14.275 --> 13:16.149
Yeah, right. Erm, all in.

13:21.657 --> 13:23.733
- Three kings.
- Whoa.

13:23.826 --> 13:27.870
- Oh, damn, I've only got three tens.
- A-ha! Get in, yer dancer!

13:27.955 --> 13:31.240
Come here, you lovely, lovely little...

13:31.333 --> 13:33.207
Oh, look at his wee face.

13:33.293 --> 13:35.618
I've got a pair of queens as well,
if that helps.

13:38.840 --> 13:43.051
Oh, come on, sit down, Alex. Shock's
best absorbed with the knees bent.

13:44.387 --> 13:47.092
Full house. Let him take it.

13:47.181 --> 13:49.388
Don't spend it all in one pub.

13:49.976 --> 13:52.182
I can retire to the Bahamas
like Roger Moore.

13:52.270 --> 13:54.939
- You mean Sean Connery.
- I'm in the Roger Moore camp.

13:55.022 --> 13:58.687
There's nothing wrong with
a little bit of camp.

13:58.776 --> 14:00.685
That's a horrible impression.

14:00.778 --> 14:02.188
- It isn't.
- It is.

14:02.279 --> 14:03.310
It's not!

14:07.993 --> 14:09.986
Alex, what is this?
Where's the Queen?

14:10.078 --> 14:12.450
That's legal tender.
It's a Scottish tenner.

14:12.539 --> 14:15.955
It's worse than Monopoly money.
I can't buy anything with this.

14:16.042 --> 14:18.118
I've only got two words for you.

14:18.211 --> 14:21.627
- Yeah, do they involve sex and travel?
- Possibly.

14:21.714 --> 14:23.209
Well, don't say them.

14:23.299 --> 14:26.383
That's our cue to leave.
Goodnight, everybody.

14:30.556 --> 14:33.510
- Fuck off!
- Leave it. Goodnight!

14:34.143 --> 14:35.721
Another round?

14:36.520 --> 14:39.307
Look, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm pissed. It was just banter.

14:39.398 --> 14:43.098
- Yeah. I know. But it's not very sexy.
- I'm not trying to be sexy.

14:43.193 --> 14:45.649
Why not? You're not on a promise.

14:51.284 --> 14:53.954
- Deal.
- Will do.

14:57.707 --> 15:00.328
Stick with me, we'll climb that
this time next year.

15:00.418 --> 15:02.991
The Eiger? Yeah, let's do it.
The north face.

15:04.714 --> 15:06.422
It killed 70 people.

15:08.009 --> 15:12.053
If you fall from the summit,
it'll take 30 seconds to hit the ground.

15:12.555 --> 15:15.674
- That's cheery.
- 30 seconds to recall your life,

15:15.766 --> 15:18.222
say your goodbyes, conscious
the whole way down.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.468
Just enough time to say
the Lord's Prayer.

15:20.562 --> 15:24.939
- If you believe that's gonna save you.
- You're really gonna need something.

15:29.488 --> 15:32.903
- It's blowing a bastard out there.
- Yeah, I know.

15:32.991 --> 15:35.945
It's, er, supposed to clear up
through the night, though.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.277
But tomorrow is gonna be tricky.

15:39.831 --> 15:41.159
Drink?

15:42.708 --> 15:43.788
Fill her up.

15:43.876 --> 15:47.459
- No, you can't mix gin and whisky.
- It's called a gisky.

15:47.546 --> 15:48.922
- Is it?
- I just invented it.

15:49.006 --> 15:50.584
- Right.
- Gisky?

15:50.716 --> 15:54.132
- Gisky. Would you like one?
- No, I'll pass.

16:06.231 --> 16:08.804
Alright, folks, slight change
of plan, I think.

16:08.900 --> 16:12.234
There are 40mph winds on that peak,
but they're gusting 60.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.781
It's supposed to die down tonight, so I
think we'll do the west face tomorrow

16:16.866 --> 16:19.238
and just tackle the north ridge today.

16:19.327 --> 16:21.782
It's nothing more than a diff.
You know, V diff.

16:21.871 --> 16:25.868
So don't worry about rock shoes, helmets
or anything that'll weigh you down.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.116
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.918
How's the exposure on the ridge?

16:30.004 --> 16:32.874
A bit thought provoking,
but keep hold of your harness.

16:32.965 --> 16:36.168
- I've got mine and we'll take the rope.
- OK, good.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.299
Got all your gear?
Don't leave anything.

16:38.387 --> 16:41.174
The only thing I left is for
a fully qualified plumber.

16:41.264 --> 16:42.593
Charming.

16:44.851 --> 16:47.176
- Good morning.
- Hey, how's the head?

16:47.270 --> 16:50.473
Two cups of coffee and three aspirin,
I'm almost human again.

16:52.442 --> 16:53.521
OK?

16:53.610 --> 16:55.935
So I guess it's a no-go
on the west face, hmm?

16:56.029 --> 16:59.693
No. This isn't Yosemite. The weather
up here does exactly what it wants.

16:59.824 --> 17:01.104
Yeah.

17:03.744 --> 17:06.579
- Got the lunch, Jen?
- Yeah, that's all under control.

17:06.664 --> 17:09.415
- What are we having?
- Sandwiches.

17:09.500 --> 17:14.042
Ah. The pinnacle of British cuisine.
No wonder the French hate us.

17:14.128 --> 17:17.000
- I make a pretty good sandwich.
- Well, what's in them?

17:17.089 --> 17:19.546
Just wait and see.
The surprise is half the fun.

17:19.634 --> 17:21.627
Just as long as it's not fish.

17:23.847 --> 17:26.053
You should try one. They're yummy.

17:26.141 --> 17:29.177
Smoked mackerel and egg?
I'd rather eat my own shit.

17:29.269 --> 17:31.427
No one's stopping you.

17:31.521 --> 17:35.388
You could always scrape out the mackerel
and just eat the bread.

17:35.483 --> 17:38.056
No, I can't do that. It's been tainted.

17:38.152 --> 17:39.730
You remind me of my daughter.

17:39.862 --> 17:42.234
She's clearly a lady of impeccable taste.

17:42.323 --> 17:43.521
She's two.

17:45.576 --> 17:48.992
You're such a fussy eater.
It's so surprising at your age.

17:49.079 --> 17:51.700
Surprise is half the fun, right?

17:51.832 --> 17:53.659
Thank fuck I brought chocolate.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.420
Five minutes and we're off.
Everybody OK with that?

17:56.503 --> 17:58.163
Sounds good.

18:06.012 --> 18:07.175
It's beautiful.

18:08.264 --> 18:11.016
I know. Scenery like this
makes me wish I could paint.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.345
I'm gonna take a piss.

18:12.435 --> 18:15.519
- Yeah, good to know.
- Thought you might be interested.

18:15.605 --> 18:18.605
No, no, mate, you feel free
to keep us updated at all times.

18:18.691 --> 18:20.150
Will do.

18:22.319 --> 18:26.648
I've found a cracking spot.
I'm unbuttoning my fly.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.117
I'm getting it out.
Fucking hell, it weighs a ton.

18:31.203 --> 18:32.578
Shut up, wanker.

18:55.810 --> 18:58.597
Hey, guys! I heard something.

18:58.687 --> 19:00.644
Oh, yeah, what?

19:00.731 --> 19:05.192
I dunno. Something.
Come here and check it out.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.566
Mate, you think I'm falling for that?

19:09.197 --> 19:10.692
I'm serious.

19:23.962 --> 19:25.669
What is it?

19:27.882 --> 19:30.207
- What's going on up there?
- Hold on a sec!

19:31.510 --> 19:33.218
Just listen.

19:35.764 --> 19:37.342
D'you hear that?

19:40.853 --> 19:42.644
I heard it.

19:42.729 --> 19:44.769
- What is it then?
- An animal?

19:45.732 --> 19:47.524
- No way.
- Then what?

19:47.609 --> 19:49.602
- Sounds to me like...
- Like what?

19:51.780 --> 19:53.060
A person.

19:54.991 --> 19:57.909
- Guys, get over here.
- What is it?

19:57.994 --> 19:59.785
Just get over here.

20:14.260 --> 20:17.130
- What is it?
- Shh. Listen.

20:23.226 --> 20:26.180
- I hear it.
- Yeah, me too.

21:22.658 --> 21:23.856
What is that?

21:23.951 --> 21:25.576
I've no idea.

21:32.126 --> 21:34.663
- Shit.
- What?

21:35.921 --> 21:38.044
It's a breathing tube.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.044
There's someone down there.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.302
Just wait here, guys. Wait!

22:10.704 --> 22:12.613
Hello?

22:12.706 --> 22:15.707
- Jesus Christ!

22:18.003 --> 22:20.920
- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell is that?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.714
Don't you mean who?

22:26.594 --> 22:27.839
What do we do?

22:29.889 --> 22:30.968
Ed.

22:33.267 --> 22:35.011
Wait a sec, guys.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.179
Hello?

22:40.191 --> 22:42.148
If you can hear us, say something!

22:44.361 --> 22:45.476
Oh, Jesus.

22:46.238 --> 22:48.563
This was dug recently.
The earth's still soft.

22:48.657 --> 22:50.400
Why would somebody be down there?

22:50.492 --> 22:53.528
- I told you I heard something.

22:53.620 --> 22:56.158
We're gonna help you.
Just sit tight for a moment.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.204
- What are you doing?
- We don't know what's down there.

23:01.294 --> 23:03.370
- It sounds like a child.
- I think so, too.

23:03.463 --> 23:05.420
We can think, but we don't fucking know.

23:05.506 --> 23:07.914
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, it's made of wood.

23:09.385 --> 23:12.836
- See if we can find the corners.
- This is insane. What are you doing?

23:12.930 --> 23:15.552
Get down here! Help us.
Fucking kneel down and help.

23:15.641 --> 23:17.883
- Come on!

23:20.229 --> 23:23.479
Right, we're gonna try
and lift it, OK? On three.

23:23.565 --> 23:26.270
One, two, three.

23:29.821 --> 23:31.399
Fuck.

23:32.074 --> 23:34.113
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

23:37.871 --> 23:39.863
Alright. Hello.

23:40.832 --> 23:44.367
Now don't be afraid. We're gonna
get you out of there. Alright?

23:44.460 --> 23:45.789
Ed?

23:46.921 --> 23:48.830
- Come on.

23:48.923 --> 23:51.675
No, no, no. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you.

23:51.759 --> 23:54.843
OK, darling? We're not gonna hurt you.
Come on.

23:56.764 --> 23:59.515
For fuck's sake, you're scaring her!
Leave her alone.

24:01.435 --> 24:03.973
It's OK, sweetie.

24:04.104 --> 24:05.847
Alright. Alright.

24:06.940 --> 24:07.971
It's OK.

24:09.026 --> 24:12.359
It's alright. I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:12.445 --> 24:15.530
It's OK. We're gonna get you out of here.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.359
Come on, sweetie.

24:18.451 --> 24:20.159
It's alright.

24:21.204 --> 24:23.777
It's OK. Good girl. It's OK.

24:26.709 --> 24:28.749
It's OK.

24:29.629 --> 24:32.546
- OK, honey. Help.
- OK.

24:33.841 --> 24:35.086
OK.

24:35.175 --> 24:38.675
Let's get you out of here.
Come up. Come up.

24:38.762 --> 24:40.470
Can you get me some water?

24:45.018 --> 24:48.185
Sit down. It's alright,
it's alright. OK.

24:48.271 --> 24:51.972
OK. OK. Here you go. There you go.

24:53.401 --> 24:57.150
Slowly. Drink slowly.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

24:57.238 --> 25:00.441
Alright. Good girl.

25:00.533 --> 25:03.783
Oh. Alright. It's OK.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.740
It's alright, it's alright. It's OK.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.785
Sweetie, can you tell...

25:12.169 --> 25:15.503
Can you tell me your name? Your name?

25:16.423 --> 25:19.459
I'm Jenny. Jenny.

25:20.510 --> 25:22.420
What's your name?

25:22.512 --> 25:24.671
- Anna.
- Anna.

25:25.599 --> 25:27.307
OK, Anna.

25:28.602 --> 25:31.970
- Anna, where are you from?

25:36.192 --> 25:38.398
OK. Alright.

25:41.572 --> 25:44.692
Anna, do you speak English?

25:44.784 --> 25:50.454
Anna? English? Does anyone know
what language that is?

25:50.539 --> 25:52.615
I dunno. Is it Russian, maybe?

25:52.708 --> 25:55.874
- Might be Croatian.
- How do you know that?

25:55.961 --> 25:59.626
Well, I had an ex-girlfriend from Zagreb
and she'd swear at me in Croat.

25:59.715 --> 26:02.751
- You're sure that's what it is?
- She used to swear at me a lot.

26:02.843 --> 26:06.425
- Can you understand what she's saying?
- No. The accent sounds familiar.

26:06.513 --> 26:08.589
Well, do you speak any Croat?

26:08.681 --> 26:10.888
I could score an eighth,
ask for a threesome.

26:10.975 --> 26:12.767
- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, for God's sake.

26:12.852 --> 26:15.308
- Dick.
- Sorry.

26:15.396 --> 26:19.725
- Why would someone do this?
- They didn't want her to die.

26:21.485 --> 26:24.023
Otherwise there wouldn't be an air pipe.

26:24.113 --> 26:27.861
I don't want to know who put her
down there or why they did it.

26:27.950 --> 26:30.488
I just want to get out of here
before they come back.

26:30.577 --> 26:33.068
Listen, listen.
She's our responsibility now.

26:33.205 --> 26:35.363
We've got to get help.
We've got to get her

26:35.958 --> 26:37.701
off these mountains soon.

26:39.377 --> 26:45.416
OK. Right, we're here, 12 miles
south-southwest of Alltnacaillich.

26:45.508 --> 26:48.260
The nearest village is Annan Mor, so...

26:48.344 --> 26:50.088
Yeah.

26:50.179 --> 26:54.047
We could go east along the Scimitar
Ridge until we get to the river,

26:54.142 --> 26:57.510
then double back to the village.
It's about 15, 20 miles all in.

26:57.603 --> 27:00.806
I found this in the hole.
She must've been down there for days.

27:00.898 --> 27:03.934
- Did she have any food?
- Didn't look like it.

27:04.026 --> 27:07.644
She must have been starving
down there all by herself in the dark.

27:07.738 --> 27:10.276
Let's not kill her with
a smoked mackerel sandwich.

27:10.365 --> 27:12.654
Can we use your phone? Phone for help?

27:12.743 --> 27:14.320
What, in these mountains?

27:14.411 --> 27:17.780
Won't get anything approaching
a signal till you get near the A9.

27:17.873 --> 27:19.367
That's about 30 miles away.

27:19.457 --> 27:21.948
You said it was 15 miles to the village.

27:23.503 --> 27:26.919
There is a faster route.
We're only two miles from Devil's Drop.

27:27.006 --> 27:30.375
- What's Devil's Drop?
- The only way to breach the ridge.

27:30.468 --> 27:32.959
It's a sheer cliff face
500 foot straight down,

27:33.054 --> 27:37.265
but from there, it is only
a four-mile hike to Annan Mor.

27:37.975 --> 27:40.015
How do we get a child down Devil's Drop?

27:40.978 --> 27:44.311
We don't. Two of us abseil down
and run to the village for help,

27:44.398 --> 27:47.933
alert the police and get the Highland
Rescue to pick up the rest of you.

27:48.026 --> 27:51.395
- Who are you gonna take with you?
- Alison.

27:51.488 --> 27:54.275
Sorry, Ed, no arguments, mate.
I need the best.

27:54.366 --> 27:58.577
It's a massive face, Rob.
I mean, we don't have enough rope.

27:58.662 --> 28:00.868
I've got 20 metres of seven mil
if that helps.

28:00.955 --> 28:02.699
No, no, you keep that with you.

28:02.790 --> 28:06.159
There's some rough terrain.
You might need it. We'll manage.

28:06.294 --> 28:09.710
- We'll multi pitch it. It'll be fine.
- Do you want us to wait here?

28:09.797 --> 28:12.003
No. There's no way we're staying here.

28:12.091 --> 28:16.967
Follow the route on the map. I'll make
sure they get the helicopter out to you.

28:17.054 --> 28:20.090
As long as you stick to that route,
they'll find you easily.

28:59.803 --> 29:02.840
- Yeah, that's it. There it is. See?
- Where?

29:02.931 --> 29:05.683
That's the Haston Step.
It's the first belay point.

29:16.402 --> 29:19.688
- You wanna go first?
- Yeah.

30:14.708 --> 30:16.167
Rob?

30:17.836 --> 30:20.541
Fuck! Rob, there's no more rope.

30:20.631 --> 30:23.003
Can you make it?

30:29.431 --> 30:32.550
- Easy.
- Shit. Shit!

30:33.810 --> 30:35.553
Easy.

31:14.182 --> 31:18.179
Alison! How is it?

31:18.269 --> 31:19.846
Fucking scary, Rob.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.765
There's no footholds for five feet.
You be careful, OK?

32:00.392 --> 32:01.803
Rob!

32:06.732 --> 32:10.432
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

32:10.527 --> 32:14.026
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

32:28.461 --> 32:32.126
Look, why don't we carry her?
Me and Ed could take it in turns.

32:32.215 --> 32:33.874
- Makes sense.
- OK.

32:35.301 --> 32:36.878
- Come on.
- Here you go.

32:36.969 --> 32:38.843
Be gentle.

32:38.929 --> 32:40.258
Anna!

32:42.850 --> 32:44.095
- Come on.
- Jesus Christ!

32:44.184 --> 32:45.560
- Put her down.
- Whoa.

32:47.854 --> 32:50.939
Right, so what do we do now?
You won't be able to carry her.

32:51.441 --> 32:55.818
- I can try.
- You'll collapse after 100 yards.

32:56.863 --> 32:58.523
Then we'll go at Anna's pace.

32:58.615 --> 33:01.402
- That's pretty fucking slow.
- Watch your language.

33:01.493 --> 33:03.734
- She can't understand.
- Hardly the point.

33:03.828 --> 33:07.031
- For fuck's sake.
- We've gotta keep moving. Come on.

33:07.123 --> 33:09.744
Do you have any idea
what she's been through?

33:09.834 --> 33:13.666
I get it, OK?
Can we just go now? Please?

33:15.131 --> 33:16.411
- Come on.
- OK.

33:16.507 --> 33:18.749
Come on, sweetie. We have to go.

34:17.774 --> 34:18.972
Fuck!

34:20.902 --> 34:22.063
Jesus!

34:24.112 --> 34:26.070
Fuck. Fuck it. Fuck!

34:37.083 --> 34:39.788
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

36:40.035 --> 36:41.445
Hey!

36:43.955 --> 36:45.034
Hey!

36:48.084 --> 36:49.708
Help!

36:58.594 --> 36:59.969
Fuck you!

37:01.722 --> 37:03.465
Fuck you.

38:22.299 --> 38:23.841
It's been cut!

38:38.815 --> 38:41.436
I think it's about a mile away
to the river.

38:50.993 --> 38:52.487
There they are.

38:57.291 --> 39:00.494
- I see them.
- How far?

39:01.420 --> 39:04.789
400 yards, maybe more.

39:04.881 --> 39:08.831
- You got a shot?
- At this range?

39:10.345 --> 39:13.299
Don't waste it.
Let's get over that next ridge.

39:41.917 --> 39:43.327
There they are.

39:50.467 --> 39:53.752
Chuck us over your hip flask
and give me a nip.

40:02.103 --> 40:04.391
What is this filthy shit?

40:04.480 --> 40:07.683
- It's spirit drink.
- Spirit drink?

40:07.775 --> 40:11.903
I got it at the petrol garage. It's so
cheap they can't even call it vodka.

40:11.987 --> 40:14.739
- It's pish.
- It gets the job done.

40:23.873 --> 40:25.154
Hello there.

40:26.042 --> 40:27.453
Good afternoon.

40:29.963 --> 40:31.789
What are you fellas doing out here?

40:32.757 --> 40:34.334
Hiking.

40:36.928 --> 40:39.216
Long way from civilisation.

40:39.305 --> 40:41.179
That's the idea.

40:41.265 --> 40:42.676
You stalking?

40:43.726 --> 40:44.924
Yeah.

40:45.769 --> 40:48.604
You know the hunting season's been over
for three months?

40:48.731 --> 40:50.011
What do you care?

40:51.316 --> 40:55.314
It's just if you're hunting out of
season, we're gonna have to report you.

40:56.363 --> 40:58.236
That's a pretty big gun.

40:58.323 --> 41:01.858
It's a 308. It'll put a dent
in just about anything.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.617
You think the deer
have a fighting chance?

41:06.372 --> 41:08.994
I think everything's
got a fighting chance.

41:11.044 --> 41:12.538
Do you?

41:12.628 --> 41:15.250
You boys a pair of animal rights
wankers, are you?

41:15.339 --> 41:16.917
You're a long way from anywhere.

41:17.008 --> 41:20.459
Me and him don't take kindly to
left-wing bastards coming out here...

41:24.598 --> 41:28.845
Please. Oh, please, don't do it.
I'll stop hunting.

41:29.436 --> 41:31.844
But everything's got a fighting chance,
right?

41:34.524 --> 41:36.232
He said that.

41:37.402 --> 41:39.441
Please. Please don't kill me.

41:39.529 --> 41:41.189
Take a step back.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.854
- Oh, God, please. Please, no.
- Hey.

41:45.034 --> 41:46.149
Do it.

41:47.453 --> 41:49.576
- Jesus Christ.
- Keep going.

41:49.664 --> 41:51.288
Oh, God, no.

41:51.374 --> 41:53.283
That's it.

41:53.376 --> 41:55.452
- And another.
- Please. Oh, fuck.

41:55.544 --> 41:58.581
- Don't stop.
- Oh, dear God!

42:09.433 --> 42:10.808
And that's that.

42:25.323 --> 42:26.437
You still with me?

42:29.619 --> 42:31.113
Whatever it takes.

42:31.704 --> 42:34.111
I think it might take a bit more
than we thought.

42:37.585 --> 42:40.289
Aye. It might.

42:53.058 --> 42:55.097
How did they sound?

42:55.185 --> 42:58.968
Practised. In control. Like they knew
exactly what they were doing.

42:59.063 --> 43:01.222
That's usually a good sign.

43:01.316 --> 43:02.644
Follow the road.

43:02.734 --> 43:07.027
- Remind me of the name of this place.
- Annan Mor. Southwest of Inverness.

43:07.113 --> 43:08.986
Still a good 80 miles.

43:31.720 --> 43:32.965
Hey!

43:35.348 --> 43:36.759
Hey!

43:36.891 --> 43:40.640
Look. Look. Look. Alison.

43:42.647 --> 43:44.972
The rope was cut.

43:45.066 --> 43:49.644
The rope was cut.
Someone cut the rope.

43:49.737 --> 43:52.109
- Can you hear her?
- She's smashed her legs up.

43:52.197 --> 43:55.282
You can see it in her leg and her arms.
Something's wrong, Jen.

43:56.535 --> 43:58.693
It's alright, sweetheart,
don't be scared.

43:58.787 --> 44:00.067
Don't be scared. It's OK.

44:00.163 --> 44:04.872
Someone cut the rope. Rob was murdered.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.332
- Can you hear what she's saying?
- Look at her leg.

44:07.420 --> 44:10.587
We can't understand
a word you're saying.

44:13.927 --> 44:17.212
I need to get across to you
further down the river.

44:17.305 --> 44:22.595
Alison! Alison, you're gonna
have to shout louder.

44:22.685 --> 44:25.935
We need to find a crossing
further downstream.

44:28.941 --> 44:32.808
She wants us to go down the river.
OK, OK. Where's Rob?

44:32.945 --> 44:34.522
Rob, where is he?

44:34.613 --> 44:36.237
Where is he?

44:46.666 --> 44:47.947
Fuck!

44:54.007 --> 44:56.165
What are we gonna do, Jen?

44:59.428 --> 45:01.220
What do we do?

45:06.060 --> 45:07.435
No.

45:19.531 --> 45:22.200
- Jen! Jenny!
- Alex!

45:22.284 --> 45:25.699
- Jenny! Jenny!

45:25.787 --> 45:27.115
Alex, Alex, Alex, no!

45:27.205 --> 45:29.494
Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!

45:29.582 --> 45:32.500
- Listen to me. Alex!
- Jenny, give me your hand.

45:36.297 --> 45:37.625
Alex, she's gone!

45:39.300 --> 45:41.873
We can't get her from here.
We've gotta go down there.

45:53.397 --> 45:55.722
Ed, Ed, I can see her.

45:57.025 --> 46:00.773
Hold on to the rocks, Jen.
Hold on to the rocks.

46:06.826 --> 46:09.032
- Hold on to the rocks!
- Alex, listen to me.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.825
You have to follow me.
I know what I'm doing. Follow me.

46:48.491 --> 46:49.570
Alison!

46:51.369 --> 46:52.697
Alison!

46:54.663 --> 46:56.490
Come on, come on!

47:33.659 --> 47:35.237
Anna!

47:38.163 --> 47:39.408
Anna!

47:45.545 --> 47:47.205
Anna!

48:29.629 --> 48:30.874
No. Gone.

48:35.843 --> 48:36.958
There!

48:54.027 --> 48:55.687
Anna!

48:56.572 --> 48:59.738
Anna! Anna!

48:59.825 --> 49:01.782
Anna!

50:04.345 --> 50:06.670
Come on, Anna.

50:06.764 --> 50:08.970
Come on, Anna. Come on.

50:18.984 --> 50:20.810
OK. Anna.

50:30.912 --> 50:32.821
It's OK, Anna.

51:22.628 --> 51:25.878
Anna! Anna!

51:56.577 --> 51:58.819
Alex. Alex.

52:02.374 --> 52:04.034
Are you alright?

52:05.043 --> 52:06.206
Look at me.

52:09.089 --> 52:13.086
- We have to find the others, OK?
- Right.

52:13.176 --> 52:14.836
Ed!

52:16.137 --> 52:17.168
Anna?

52:20.725 --> 52:22.682
Ed!

53:09.730 --> 53:12.138
- Here!

53:54.898 --> 53:56.690
Ed.

53:56.775 --> 53:58.234
Anna.

53:58.318 --> 53:59.729
Ed.

54:02.239 --> 54:05.773
Anna. Thank God. Shh. Shh.

54:10.205 --> 54:11.319
What happened?

54:11.414 --> 54:14.949
I fell. It might be broken,
I don't know.

54:22.049 --> 54:23.876
They're coming.

54:23.968 --> 54:25.378
- How many?
- Two.

54:25.469 --> 54:27.094
Shit.

54:30.432 --> 54:33.005
- OK, let's go.
- No. He can't run.

54:33.101 --> 54:36.055
- I can try.
- That won't be enough.

54:38.565 --> 54:43.523
Look, listen. You, me, Ed,
we don't mean a thing to these people.

54:43.611 --> 54:47.276
She's the only one with any value.
She's what they want.

54:56.165 --> 54:57.196
That's her!

55:00.878 --> 55:03.416
- What about the others?
- Follow the money!

57:03.370 --> 57:06.205
Are you gonna finish him
or do you want me to do it?

57:06.289 --> 57:10.334
After what he's just put us through?
No, I wanna watch him breathe out.

57:20.386 --> 57:22.130
You feel that?

57:24.140 --> 57:26.512
That's the price of your nobility.

57:29.395 --> 57:31.304
Hurts, doesn't it?

57:43.533 --> 57:46.487
In 200 metres, bear left.

57:48.955 --> 57:51.826
In 150 metres, bear left.

57:52.250 --> 57:53.661
In one...

57:57.255 --> 57:58.500
Well done.

58:00.133 --> 58:04.379
- How will we know where to go?
- Maybe we should just bear left.

58:04.470 --> 58:08.088
People have been finding their way
for years without fucking computers.

58:08.182 --> 58:11.302
There is no equal to a map
and a bit of nous.

58:11.393 --> 58:13.884
- How are we doing back there?
- I'm almost done.

58:13.979 --> 58:16.137
Just gotta check the frequency.

58:16.607 --> 58:20.355
If this briefcase moves so much
as an inch, we're gonna know about it.

58:20.444 --> 58:22.235
Well, that's reassuring.

58:22.320 --> 58:25.855
I may as well wipe my arse on that money
if we can't find the girl.

58:57.354 --> 58:58.682
OK.

59:00.190 --> 59:02.182
OK, Anna, I'm gonna need you
to lean back.

59:03.526 --> 59:04.902
Just take a step.

59:04.986 --> 59:07.192
It's OK, sweetheart.
Just, just lean back.

59:10.491 --> 59:14.026
You gotta trust me. It's OK, I promise.
Just take a step back and lean...

59:14.120 --> 59:15.947
No, Alison. Alison.

59:16.038 --> 59:19.407
Jesus Christ, Anna!
There's no other way down!

59:21.460 --> 59:22.835
OK.

59:26.048 --> 59:29.168
Look at me. Look at me. I've got you.

59:30.552 --> 59:32.545
You have to trust me, sweetheart.

59:33.221 --> 59:34.466
OK?

59:34.556 --> 59:38.055
Put your shoulders back. Lean back.

59:38.143 --> 59:40.100
There you go.

59:40.186 --> 59:43.306
Good girl. Good girl.

59:49.987 --> 59:52.988
- It's OK, Anna. Keep coming.

59:53.074 --> 59:55.315
Oops. Keep coming. Steady, steady.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:06.033
OK. Alright. I've got you. I've got you.

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:36.609
- This is no time for a rest. Let's go.
- Just give me a moment, please.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:39.154
If Alex made it, he'd have
called the police.

01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:43.285
They could already be looking for us.

01:00:44.164 --> 01:00:45.742
You heard the shots, Alison.

01:00:47.167 --> 01:00:48.745
He's dead.

01:00:53.048 --> 01:00:54.672
Let's go. Get up.

01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:56.675
Get up!

01:00:58.178 --> 01:00:59.672
Leave me here.

01:01:01.639 --> 01:01:04.011
I'm slowing you down as it is.
Just leave me here.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.176
- You don't want that.
- I've broken my leg.

01:01:06.269 --> 01:01:09.435
- What more do you want?
- It's not broken. You're walking on it.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.684
- What if we've done the wrong thing?
- What do you mean?

01:01:21.533 --> 01:01:24.107
Maybe we should have left her there.

01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:27.618
- What?
- Hear me out. Please.

01:01:27.706 --> 01:01:29.497
Please listen to me.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.875
Why was she even there?

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.830
Why in Scotland? She clearly
sounds Eastern European.

01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:37.079
I don't know, Ed.
I don't know. You tell me.

01:01:37.173 --> 01:01:40.257
Maybe she was kidnapped.
She's still in her school uniform.

01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:43.130
She was probably snatched
right outside the school.

01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:46.138
Kidnappers usually demand a ransom,
don't they?

01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:52.219
In which case there's probably
another party involved, police.

01:01:53.022 --> 01:01:56.521
And what if we've come along
and trampled on a delicate situation?

01:01:57.234 --> 01:02:00.318
We might have blown her chances
of a safe handover.

01:02:01.154 --> 01:02:02.697
What if we've killed her?

01:02:03.323 --> 01:02:05.446
What if this is all our fault?

01:02:05.534 --> 01:02:07.526
- Look at her.
- I'm just...

01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:09.196
Just fucking look at her.

01:02:10.455 --> 01:02:14.369
Could you leave her in the ground?
Could you?

01:02:16.252 --> 01:02:17.283
No.

01:02:18.963 --> 01:02:20.374
Then there's your answer.

01:02:22.383 --> 01:02:25.668
Did her family do this to her?
Was she kidnapped? I don't know.

01:02:25.761 --> 01:02:28.632
And you don't know.
But if we've done the wrong thing,

01:02:28.722 --> 01:02:32.471
then I'll fucking live with it.
Now get up! Find a way.

01:02:35.938 --> 01:02:37.895
They'll be heading up to Annan Mor.

01:02:38.565 --> 01:02:41.899
And here we are, empty fucking handed.

01:02:43.236 --> 01:02:46.486
Look, you remember that Japanese kid
last winter? Remember him?

01:02:46.573 --> 01:02:48.861
Rats crawled through the pipe,
ate him alive.

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:51.488
- What about him?
- Parents still paid up.

01:02:51.578 --> 01:02:55.705
Bluffed our way out of that. Maybe
we can't bluff our way out of this.

01:02:56.958 --> 01:03:00.492
You do it your way. I'll try mine.

01:03:11.972 --> 01:03:14.380
You're probably wondering

01:03:14.474 --> 01:03:16.384
why your daughter has not come home.

01:03:16.476 --> 01:03:19.928
We have dug a hole,
four feet by three. She's down there.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:24.357
She has enough water for a week,
maybe less. She has no food.

01:03:24.442 --> 01:03:26.399
There's no chance you can find her.

01:03:26.486 --> 01:03:30.484
Her location is as remote
as it is inaccessible.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.818
You're being watched.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:35.111
If you try and contact the police,
we will leave her where she is.

01:03:35.203 --> 01:03:38.868
She will die there. In the dark. Alone.

01:03:38.956 --> 01:03:41.114
You will never find her body.

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:44.209
We want money. Six million euros.

01:03:44.295 --> 01:03:49.122
Clean, non-sequential. No marked money,
transponders or dye packs.

01:03:49.216 --> 01:03:52.170
More instructions regarding
the hand-off will follow.

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.920
Stay by the phone.

01:03:55.639 --> 01:03:56.718
Who taped the call?

01:03:57.474 --> 01:04:02.551
My employer records everything.
That includes his ex-wife's telephone.

01:04:03.354 --> 01:04:05.976
Well, these bastards aren't stupid,
are they?

01:04:06.107 --> 01:04:10.021
If you call the police and they get
nicked, they just gotta deny everything.

01:04:10.153 --> 01:04:13.319
Since the girl's in the ground,
there's no connection to us.

01:04:13.406 --> 01:04:14.816
She dies about the same time

01:04:14.907 --> 01:04:17.528
that the police release them
due to lack of evidence.

01:04:17.618 --> 01:04:19.776
There's no body, no murder investigation.

01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:22.326
That is about as sweet a hustle
as I've ever seen.

01:04:22.414 --> 01:04:25.783
The only time they expose themselves
is at the hand-off.

01:04:27.294 --> 01:04:29.619
Do you know where the pub is?

01:04:29.713 --> 01:04:32.548
It's not a big village. I'll find it.

01:04:32.632 --> 01:04:35.123
When you get there, you grab
a table by the window.

01:04:35.218 --> 01:04:37.970
If you can't find one,
you stand by the bar and you wait.

01:04:38.054 --> 01:04:40.379
No one will approach you
until you sit down.

01:04:40.473 --> 01:04:42.513
Don't try and guess who it's gonna be.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.270
Think about nothing except that table.
Understand?

01:04:45.353 --> 01:04:46.468
Yeah.

01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:51.772
Don't look too confident.
Don't look too nervous either.

01:04:51.859 --> 01:04:55.726
You find a middle ground. You let 'em
know that it's strictly business.

01:04:55.821 --> 01:04:59.272
If they've got the girl,
they're gonna get paid.

01:04:59.366 --> 01:05:02.237
- Let's hope they bring her.
- They will. They have to.

01:05:02.327 --> 01:05:06.277
They'll keep her out of sight until they
see the money. That's where you come in.

01:05:06.373 --> 01:05:09.658
You demand to see her
before you hand it over.

01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:12.503
If they can get away without making
a trade, they will.

01:05:12.587 --> 01:05:16.455
Leaving a body behind is a lot easier
than making a full exchange.

01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:21.507
No one makes a move until we see
the girl. If I return without her...

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.391
Have you met her father?

01:05:27.477 --> 01:05:30.228
I've heard of him by reputation.

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:39.111
- So you know that...
- He's got a pretty bad reputation.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:45.071
Have a jolly up in Kosovo, did he?
Little bit of an ethnic spring clean?

01:05:45.994 --> 01:05:49.493
Same as the rest of the Serbian wankers
that we slotted back in '99.

01:05:49.581 --> 01:05:53.994
So trust me, yes, I know who
I'm dealing with.

01:05:54.085 --> 01:05:55.959
Really?

01:05:56.045 --> 01:05:59.580
When we make our move,
it's gonna be quick and loud.

01:05:59.674 --> 01:06:03.588
Throw yourself on the floor cos he's
gonna go like fucking Christian Bale.

01:06:03.678 --> 01:06:06.169
Stay down till me or him picks you up.

01:06:06.264 --> 01:06:09.964
All I care about is the girl.
We get her safe and quick.

01:06:10.059 --> 01:06:11.683
Then we worry about her captors.

01:06:11.769 --> 01:06:14.639
Your employers, they wanna
keep 'em alive?

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:17.303
- If possible.
- We'll see.

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:23.145
No shotguns. I can't risk you
hitting the girl.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.568
It's loaded with solid shot, no spread.

01:06:27.367 --> 01:06:30.818
We're English, Darko.
We leave friendly fire to the Yanks.

01:06:36.376 --> 01:06:38.000
Hey!

01:06:39.587 --> 01:06:41.710
Hey. Hey.

01:07:53.825 --> 01:07:56.113
Hi. We, erm... We need to...

01:07:56.202 --> 01:07:58.775
We need to report a kidnapping
and three murders.

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:40.984
We'll get you up to Inverness
as quick as we can.

01:08:41.078 --> 01:08:44.078
Constable Stewart will drive you.
He shouldn't be a minute.

01:08:44.163 --> 01:08:47.165
They can take your statements,
give you medical attention.

01:08:47.251 --> 01:08:51.247
I'll be just past the kitchen.
So don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

01:08:51.337 --> 01:08:53.792
- You said kitchen.
- Aye.

01:08:53.881 --> 01:08:56.005
She could do with something to eat.

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:16.438
- I can't get through to Inverness.
- Why not?

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:18.984
It's a big country.
It all needs policing.

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:21.279
So call another station.

01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:25.737
I've left a message. I'm sure the desk
sergeant will call back in a minute.

01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:30.993
Chocolate cake. My wife's recipe.
I think you might just love it.

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:51.723
You Darko?

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:54.891
Yes.

01:09:56.066 --> 01:09:57.940
You got something for me?

01:09:58.902 --> 01:10:01.737
- That depends.
- Does it?

01:10:03.073 --> 01:10:06.157
I've got the more valuable
merchandise. What have you got?

01:10:07.494 --> 01:10:08.692
Money?

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:15.289
There'll always be money in the world,
mate. Plenty of that to go round.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:19.326
But this little girl? Unique.

01:10:20.673 --> 01:10:22.333
One of a kind.

01:10:23.718 --> 01:10:27.550
- What are you trying to say?
- That we do things my way.

01:10:31.767 --> 01:10:33.926
You brought the money?

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.351
Yeah.

01:10:39.566 --> 01:10:42.271
Then this is how we're gonna do it.

01:10:42.361 --> 01:10:45.397
I leave here now with the case
and check it with my associates.

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:47.689
All being well and good,

01:10:47.783 --> 01:10:52.575
you'll receive a call telling you
where you can find the girl.

01:10:56.958 --> 01:10:58.286
No.

01:11:02.505 --> 01:11:05.838
- Then I'm gonna leave.
- Go?

01:11:05.925 --> 01:11:08.594
You sure?

01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:12.093
You're not gonna walk out of here
empty handed

01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:14.506
without listening to what I have to say.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.724
- I wouldn't fucking bet on that, mate.
- I stake six million euros on it.

01:11:23.316 --> 01:11:25.356
That's what you've got in the case?

01:11:25.443 --> 01:11:30.189
We both know only fools fill cases
with counterfeit money,

01:11:30.281 --> 01:11:35.868
fools who don't care to see
their children again. I'm no fool.

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:41.659
I'm glad to hear it. Because the same
thing happened to me a few years back.

01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:46.581
I took a boy from his family
in Marseilles.

01:11:48.632 --> 01:11:51.384
Well, it was a long negotiation
to say the least.

01:11:51.468 --> 01:11:54.173
Went on for so long I made a mistake.

01:11:58.475 --> 01:11:59.934
I bonded with the boy.

01:12:01.478 --> 01:12:03.221
We became close.

01:12:07.359 --> 01:12:11.023
He kept saying he wanted to come
and visit me when it was all over.

01:12:18.035 --> 01:12:21.950
His parents decided to hand off
a bag full of shredded newspaper.

01:12:22.039 --> 01:12:25.206
Police thought they were gonna catch us
during the drop-off.

01:12:27.086 --> 01:12:28.663
Oh, no.

01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:36.176
I took the boy out in the garden
to play a game of football.

01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:38.633
I remember because he went in goal.

01:12:39.931 --> 01:12:43.632
When he bent down to pick up the ball,
I shot him in the back of the head.

01:12:44.978 --> 01:12:47.469
Quick. Painless.

01:12:49.357 --> 01:12:51.184
Least I could do.

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:55.938
I buried him somewhere
in the southwest of France.

01:12:58.949 --> 01:13:01.820
Parents are still looking for him,
last I heard.

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:05.575
Well done.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:11.415
Like I said, I'm no fool.

01:13:13.046 --> 01:13:14.540
Good.

01:13:15.715 --> 01:13:17.957
Because that's a true story.

01:13:28.394 --> 01:13:31.265
You see? Nothing to worry about.

01:13:32.315 --> 01:13:35.434
- Anyone fancy a cup of tea?
- Tea?

01:13:35.526 --> 01:13:38.017
Aye. Nothing like a brew
to set you straight.

01:13:38.112 --> 01:13:42.441
No. No, I don't reckon
a brew's gonna do it this time.

01:13:42.533 --> 01:13:45.284
You said you were gonna
get us to Inverness.

01:13:45.369 --> 01:13:47.776
We wanna get out of here
as quickly as possible.

01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:51.490
Understood.

01:13:51.625 --> 01:13:54.875
Let me just get on to PC Stewart
and we'll see where he's got to.

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:05.545
- You don't have to be so rude.
- Fuck rude! People are dead.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.716
I wanna get out of this village,
out of this fucking country.

01:14:08.808 --> 01:14:11.014
And we will. Relax. We're safe now.

01:14:11.102 --> 01:14:14.435
How long's he gonna take?
And where's this other officer?

01:14:14.522 --> 01:14:16.431
Sure I can't tempt anyone with a cuppa?

01:14:16.524 --> 01:14:19.145
We were supposed to be in a police car
15 minutes ago.

01:14:19.235 --> 01:14:21.393
No, thanks! You're being paranoid.

01:14:21.487 --> 01:14:24.772
Well, did you actually see him
call for help? Did you hear it?

01:14:24.865 --> 01:14:28.150
- Why haven't they returned his call?
- It's only been ten minutes.

01:14:28.243 --> 01:14:30.485
A lot can happen in ten minutes, Alison.

01:14:31.371 --> 01:14:35.238
Are you ready to trust someone we've
just met after what we've been through?

01:14:36.084 --> 01:14:39.916
What if he's keeping us busy while he
waits for his mates to finish us off?

01:14:45.426 --> 01:14:47.004
Shit!

01:14:50.056 --> 01:14:51.550
- What do we do?
- We should go.

01:14:52.767 --> 01:14:56.930
- Let's wait five minutes, see if...
- How much longer do you wanna wait for?

01:14:57.021 --> 01:14:59.393
Even if he's not in on it,
what good's he gonna do?

01:14:59.481 --> 01:15:03.313
What can he protect us from? He's a fat
man with a badge armed with a biro.

01:15:03.402 --> 01:15:06.486
No, I say we leave now.
We take our chances in the crowd.

01:15:10.408 --> 01:15:11.653
OK.

01:15:11.743 --> 01:15:14.530
Anna, we're just gonna go for a walk,
sweetheart.

01:15:17.332 --> 01:15:20.083
What's going on? Where are you going?

01:15:20.168 --> 01:15:21.330
We're just...

01:15:21.419 --> 01:15:23.210
- We're leaving.
- It's not safe.

01:15:23.296 --> 01:15:25.869
- Well, we're going.
- Absolutely not.

01:15:25.965 --> 01:15:29.049
You're my responsibility.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

01:15:29.135 --> 01:15:31.507
You can't keep us here.
If we wanna go, we'll go.

01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:35.463
You want to walk out of here? Fine.
But I can't let you take the girl.

01:15:36.892 --> 01:15:39.893
I mean it. You leave,
you leave without her.

01:15:40.479 --> 01:15:41.937
Ed!

01:15:42.689 --> 01:15:46.105
- Don't come any closer.
- Easy, lad, easy.

01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:49.146
Don't do something
you'll have to pay for later.

01:15:49.237 --> 01:15:54.148
Put the knife down. Right now.

01:15:55.326 --> 01:15:57.366
What the...

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.115
Get down!

01:16:13.761 --> 01:16:16.168
Stay low, stay low. Keep down.

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:32.019
PC Stewart. Come in, over.

01:16:32.946 --> 01:16:38.485
Shots fired. I'm under
attack. I need you back at the station.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:48.041
Get back against the wall!

01:16:48.127 --> 01:16:52.788
- Hey, hey. Is there a back door?
- Yes. You'll need keys.

01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:54.506
- Where?

01:17:00.555 --> 01:17:02.014
Follow me.

01:17:02.974 --> 01:17:04.766
Down! Get down!

01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:15.527
Anna, quick.

01:18:00.613 --> 01:18:03.697
Now what we have here
is a situation based on trust.

01:18:03.782 --> 01:18:06.534
I trust you when you say
that you've brought the money.

01:18:08.162 --> 01:18:12.788
And you have to trust me when I say
the girl is safe and somewhere nearby.

01:18:14.376 --> 01:18:16.499
I can't even walk into to a newsagent

01:18:16.586 --> 01:18:19.208
and buy a pack of cigarettes on trust,
my friend.

01:18:19.798 --> 01:18:22.882
Now, if I can't do that,

01:18:22.967 --> 01:18:26.052
how do you expect me to let
a man like you

01:18:26.137 --> 01:18:30.846
walk out of here with a fucking
retirement plan in a briefcase? Hmm?

01:18:33.978 --> 01:18:35.638
Man like me?

01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:38.565
A kidnapper and a child murderer, yes.

01:18:40.484 --> 01:18:41.943
That's a bit personal.

01:18:43.779 --> 01:18:48.322
You're a grown man, you can take it.
And this is business.

01:18:49.618 --> 01:18:51.694
Like the man in the newsagent.

01:18:54.456 --> 01:18:57.741
I hand him the money because I can
see what I'm buying.

01:18:57.834 --> 01:19:01.250
It even comes with a government
health warning.

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:06.924
He gives me what I want
and we both walk away happy.

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:08.753
So, no.

01:19:10.972 --> 01:19:13.011
This is not based on trust.

01:19:14.058 --> 01:19:17.059
This is based on what I can see
in front of me.

01:19:21.648 --> 01:19:23.807
And you're getting nothing...

01:19:25.652 --> 01:19:28.060
...until I see the girl. Nothing.

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:38.829
He's got a gun! Run!

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.675
Hurry, hurry.

01:19:57.349 --> 01:19:58.760
Fuck!

01:20:45.645 --> 01:20:49.429
They don't have the girl.
They don't have the girl!

01:20:52.443 --> 01:20:53.819
They've lost the girl.

01:20:53.903 --> 01:20:55.528
It's a bluff.

01:21:41.449 --> 01:21:42.991
Where are you?

01:21:55.754 --> 01:21:57.332
Hey, hey, I love you.

01:22:15.356 --> 01:22:17.016
How am I doing, mate?

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:25.317
Never mind the bollocks.
Give it me straight.

01:22:28.035 --> 01:22:31.902
It's gone straight through the vest
and made a wreck of you. You're dying.

01:22:32.789 --> 01:22:35.660
You don't have long
and there's nothing I can do.

01:22:36.668 --> 01:22:37.783
Just bad luck, mate.

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:44.748
Gun.

01:22:46.052 --> 01:22:47.676
Gun.

01:23:27.133 --> 01:23:29.256
Hey! What's going on?

01:23:44.274 --> 01:23:45.437
Get down!

01:24:23.145 --> 01:24:26.146
You should have just given us the girl!

01:24:31.778 --> 01:24:34.648
Where has your compassion
gotten you today?

01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:45.998
You fucking bitch!

01:25:57.568 --> 01:25:59.027
Hello again.

01:28:32.216 --> 01:28:34.339
Darko, you're a man of your word.

01:29:31.815 --> 01:29:33.523
It's OK.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.065
It's OK, Anna. It's OK.

01:29:45.119 --> 01:29:46.946
It's OK.

01:30:23.531 --> 01:30:27.742
- What the hell is this?
- This is her father. Now you get paid.

01:30:27.826 --> 01:30:29.819
If this starts to feel like an ambush,

01:30:29.912 --> 01:30:32.450
I will take the top
of your fucking head off.

01:30:33.332 --> 01:30:36.701
- Just so we're clear.
- Stay in the car until I call for you.

01:30:36.793 --> 01:30:39.794
- Let me do the talking.
- Don't talk yourself out of a life.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.504
My employer is a businessman.

01:30:42.549 --> 01:30:44.755
Last I heard, he was a fucking
war criminal.

01:30:44.843 --> 01:30:46.385
Nice.

01:31:47.861 --> 01:31:49.901
500,000.

01:31:50.822 --> 01:31:52.862
I can get it for you in an hour.

01:31:56.328 --> 01:31:57.656
No?

01:31:59.539 --> 01:32:01.697
It was worth a try.

01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:06.208
My daughter must have looked like
a good payday to you.

01:32:06.296 --> 01:32:08.418
Divorce has made my ex-wife rich.

01:32:08.506 --> 01:32:10.629
There is very little she could not afford.

01:32:11.342 --> 01:32:15.340
But behind every woman with money
is a man with deep pockets.

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:18.596
You should have concerned yourself
with how he lined them.

01:32:20.476 --> 01:32:22.552
Strip that piece of shit.

01:32:38.118 --> 01:32:40.609
Darko tells me you lost a man.

01:32:41.079 --> 01:32:42.454
That's right.

01:32:43.248 --> 01:32:47.909
Don't cry too hard.
Now you won't have to split your fee.

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:51.294
My daughter is safe.

01:32:52.131 --> 01:32:54.289
I am in debt to you.

01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:57.173
There's a way to fix that.

01:32:59.096 --> 01:33:01.219
Your account has already been credited.

01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:06.723
You can keep the car. A parting gift.

01:33:19.782 --> 01:33:23.198
Put him in the ground. Prepare my tools.

01:34:17.546 --> 01:34:19.669
Do you understand what she said?

01:34:21.925 --> 01:34:24.297
I think she said "thank you".

01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:42.227
Are you alright, sweetheart?

01:34:46.782 --> 01:34:47.945
Yeah.
