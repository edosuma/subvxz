WEBVTT

00:50.967 --> 00:53.303
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.386 --> 00:56.097
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:00.185 --> 01:01.936
<i>Kang Yo-han was abandoned?</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.399
<i>Still, you said his brother, Yi-sak,</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:09.027
was good to Kang Yo-han.
And that they got along.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.278
Or am I wrong?

01:10.904 --> 01:15.158
Did you hear that Master Yo-han was
the survivor of a fire disaster?

01:15.241 --> 01:16.076
Yes.

01:16.659 --> 01:19.579
The incident happened only a month
after President Kang's death.

01:19.662 --> 01:23.416
And Master Yi-sak perished
in that same fire.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.090
Judge Kang!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.092
You were simply at your best today!

01:33.176 --> 01:35.804
When the tables turned
with the reports from our citizens,

01:35.887 --> 01:38.473
our TRP peaked at…
Wait. You have the data ready, right?

01:38.556 --> 01:41.434
-Well…
-Producer, please calm down.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.105
Judge Kang, when we received
that letter of pardon yesterday,

01:47.023 --> 01:48.733
I thought it was all over.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.944
I'm truly ashamed, as a judge myself.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.199
Ashamed?

01:56.908 --> 01:57.826
Lift your head up.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.036
We are a team.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.249
-You know that, don't you?
-Yes, Judge Kang.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.508
"We are a team."

02:14.717 --> 02:16.678
Even the epilogue was perfect.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.721
I captured that on tape just now.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.348
<i>We are a team.</i>

02:20.431 --> 02:22.475
-Well done, you!
<i>-You know that, don't you?</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:23.810
Our TRP is off the charts!

02:23.893 --> 02:25.145
Let's go!

02:28.273 --> 02:29.732
Why you… damn it!

02:32.944 --> 02:34.946
Don't worry too much, Young-min.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.658
But what's going to happen to me now?

02:38.741 --> 02:41.161
Does that mean I'm off to jail
for some hundred years?

02:41.244 --> 02:42.996
What, over something like this?

02:43.079 --> 02:45.498
Do you honestly think he can mess
with the son of Minister of Justice?

02:45.582 --> 02:48.126
That psycho judge won't have time
to care for that.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.588
He's desperate to be applauded
by the common people!

02:51.671 --> 02:54.215
I'm sure there's still a way.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.217
We still have time until the next trial.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.803
So calm down, Young-min. Please!

02:58.887 --> 03:00.680
In fact, let me call your mother.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.223
Hey, my phone.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.449
Hello?

03:20.617 --> 03:23.119
Well, this is
a little unexpected, Minister.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.080
Why are you going to such lengths?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.584
<i>I think that's a question for your son.</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:33.379
Why did you go to such lengths,
with all those people?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.590
<i>That child has been through a lot too.</i>

03:35.673 --> 03:37.884
He just has trouble suppressing his anger.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.136
But really, he's not a bad person.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.847
Now I'm curious whether
you'd accepted such excuses

03:42.931 --> 03:44.307
back in your prosecutor days.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.476
-Look, Judge Kang.
-<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

03:47.310 --> 03:48.269
Let's meet.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.939
<i>I won't take too much of your time.</i>

04:07.288 --> 04:08.790
Thank you for coming.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.626
Isn't our meeting rather appropriate?

04:12.210 --> 04:13.461
What is your business?

04:17.840 --> 04:20.301
-What should I do?
-I'm sorry, but what do you mean?

04:21.511 --> 04:24.430
What must I do for you to let my son go?

04:24.514 --> 04:27.642
Your son is only being judged by the law.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.768
Don't lie to me.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.604
Your initial target was me
when you tracked down my son.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.814
Is that really what you think?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.651
What is it that you want from me?

04:36.734 --> 04:38.945
Don't give me that
typical answer of "justice."

04:39.612 --> 04:41.489
It's power, isn't it? Or authority.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.994
You're only doing this
to win favors from the crowd.

04:46.077 --> 04:50.748
What if I provided you with a bigger prey?
Like a conglomerate or even the president.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.003
Nineteen years ago,

04:55.086 --> 04:58.006
you'd investigated a young,
promising politician, didn't you?

04:58.089 --> 04:59.924
For receiving bribes.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.219
-What are you--
-At that time,

05:03.303 --> 05:07.056
you were fully aware that
the politician did not accept the money,

05:07.140 --> 05:09.600
yet you led the investigation
toward making him guilty.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.978
That was some remarkable dexterity,

05:12.061 --> 05:14.689
and even those who'd given you
the orders admitted it.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.607
What are you on about?

05:16.691 --> 05:18.901
Honesty and integrity
had been his trademark,

05:21.029 --> 05:22.739
so in the end, he took his own life.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.034
Leaving behind his only son
who was still in middle school.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.496
During these past 19 years
on your fast track to success,

05:30.580 --> 05:34.292
did you ever think back on that case?
Ever? Even just once?

05:34.375 --> 05:37.170
Don't give me this nonsense.
That was a lawful investigation.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.213
Lawful investigation? Please.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.466
These are my conditions.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.594
Confess the truth about that case
to the media.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.765
Once you do, I'll let your son go.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.853
I'll give you time to think it over.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.026
People don't change all that easily.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.946
Right?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.282
Thank you.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.983
Get out.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.154
-I'm sorry.
-Out!

08:43.064 --> 08:44.774
-Butler.
<i>-Yes, Master.</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:47.568
I'm starving. Is there anything to eat?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.904
<i>-The ingredients we have--</i>
-Not cooking.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.614
Something I can just warm up.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.407
<i>There's pizza and beef over rice.</i>

08:54.242 --> 08:55.701
Beef over rice sounds nice.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.036
<i>It's in the fridge.</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:02.667
Did Elijah have dinner?

09:02.750 --> 09:05.002
<i>Yes, she had beef over rice.</i>

09:09.882 --> 09:11.717
Does she have the same taste as me?

09:29.151 --> 09:30.820
Do you always eat alone like that?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.533
Yes. Does it change anything
if I eat with someone else?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.287
All alone in this big house,
with no one else?

09:40.288 --> 09:43.416
It's the humans that are the most
dangerous and harmful in this world.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.588
Did you have something to say?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.299
No, sir.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.513
That was unlike you.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.349
What do you mean?

10:42.183 --> 10:43.809
That toast was delicious.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.853
What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?

10:47.104 --> 10:50.149
-I only just came into work…
-What?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.735
I'm glad to hear you found it delicious.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.246
What are you looking at?

11:11.879 --> 11:14.298
Maybe we should seek help from him.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.510
-Who? That old geezer?
-Yes.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.805
What's the use in this situation?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.056
Minister Cha.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.016
In these times of uncertainty and unrest,

11:24.100 --> 11:27.478
just two have managed to surpass
90 percent in terms of public confidence.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.272
The Social Responsibility Foundation…

11:32.274 --> 11:34.860
But then again,
who would refuse free money?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.153
It brings out the beggar in all of us.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.906
The other is
the Department of Live Court Show.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.368
Those unfaithful dogs!

11:42.451 --> 11:45.788
With all due respect, the figures
for the Prosecution's Office is…

11:45.871 --> 11:47.373
just 12 percent.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.263
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOUNDATION

12:21.782 --> 12:23.117
Hello, Minister.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.870
I apologize,

12:25.953 --> 12:28.581
but the Chairman is in meditation
and won't see anyone.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.583
Will you call back again next time?

12:32.334 --> 12:33.419
Pardon?

12:35.963 --> 12:39.175
Then leave your message with me.
I'll relay it to him.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.308
Yes. Yes, I know.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.478
Any mother would do the same.
Of course I understand.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.439
Yes.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.321
Minister Cha,
let's set this right together.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.365
Yes, thank you.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.288
Gosh, my ears.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.457
Did she have to go on like that?

13:35.439 --> 13:39.527
Looks like we'll need to meet, Judge Kang.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.320
JUDGE KANG YO-HAN

13:44.281 --> 13:45.241
Are you hurt?

13:50.704 --> 13:51.830
I'm sorry.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.214
That's unexpected.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.341
I don’t mean you.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.595
That cat never goes to strangers.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.432
I'm quite popular among
street cats, you know.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.269
I guess cats can tell
a good person from the bad.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.436
Don't make me laugh.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.607
But not the stupid ones.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.985
-What?
-I mean the cat.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.158
She's a street cat too.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.119
Is she?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.329
I see. But she looks like
an expensive breed.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.664
Yo-han brought her home.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.500
He may not look it, but he always brings
things home from the streets.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.295
Why do you think it's not like him?

14:40.170 --> 14:44.300
Don't tell me you also believe
what they're saying about him on TV.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.220
"Judge Kang, the hero of justice
who sides with the weak."

14:49.555 --> 14:50.723
So he isn't?

14:51.223 --> 14:52.474
As I thought, you are dumb.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.562
This cat here, she still catches mice
even when we feed her every day.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.480
Can you guess why?

14:59.857 --> 15:01.567
-Well…
-Because it's fun.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.403
She's only doing it for fun.
Because she's bored.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.657
How do you think Yo-han became
the master of this house?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.456
What do you mean by that?

15:15.539 --> 15:16.498
Well…

15:17.791 --> 15:19.084
I think about just that,

15:20.628 --> 15:21.629
every day.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.773
Hey, Su-hyeon.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.109
Do you think I can meet with the officers
who investigated the fire ten years ago?

15:44.777 --> 15:45.861
Well, you see…

15:48.197 --> 15:50.324
Why? Were you on some important call?

15:50.407 --> 15:53.452
Shouldn't you knock
before coming into other people's rooms?

15:53.535 --> 15:56.246
In case you forgot, this is my house.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.957
How long do you plan on
staying here like this?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.333
Well…

15:59.416 --> 16:01.794
Let me get some more rest,
for another few days.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.796
Sometimes I get dizzy…

16:03.879 --> 16:06.090
But you'd wander around
the house just fine.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.841
Or are you curious about something?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.302
Is there something you're after?

16:12.346 --> 16:15.057
I'm not so interested
in other people's affairs.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.768
Oh, really?

16:20.896 --> 16:24.108
Let's say that's the case, then.
How about we go pick out some clothes?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.903
-Clothes?
-I need you to come somewhere with me.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.154
Now follow me.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.954
How about this one?

16:47.214 --> 16:49.925
Here's the bow-tie,
and the shirt is in the bottom drawers.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.682
Here.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.852
What's this for?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.979
Because you need to live in the
same moment as me from now on.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.368
What are you waiting for?

17:19.538 --> 17:22.374
-Do I have to help you dress too?
-I can manage fine on my own.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.256
What?

17:32.426 --> 17:33.427
Seriously.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.101
Your wound's healed fine.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.587
This too?

18:08.670 --> 18:09.713
Put it on.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.685
Not as bad as I thought.

18:23.769 --> 18:24.853
Not at all.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.397
Because unlike someone, I'm still young.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.276
-What?
-Hey, Mister.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.486
Did you say, "mister?"

18:38.075 --> 18:39.451
Elijah, did you have dinner?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.383
But I still have it in me.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.463
-You know how to drive, don't you?
-Yes.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.140
What are you doing? Get in.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.831
Welcome.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.166
This way, sir.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.046
-Hello, Judge Kang.
-Hello, Judges.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.548
-They're so awesome.
-Hello.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.260
-So awesome.
-Hello.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.815
Judge Kang.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.359
I'll be right back.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.864
Nice to meet you.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.201
I'm Jung Seon-a,
and I assist Chairman Seo Jeong-hak

20:44.284 --> 20:45.869
with his work at the SRF.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.330
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Ga-on.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.792
Yes.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.794
My goodness!

20:53.877 --> 20:56.213
You'll make a fine actor too, Judge Kim.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.006
-Thank you.
-Why not make a debut on screen?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.424
Our broadcasting station
will be happy to have you.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.426
You're scaring him.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.888
It's our station that hosts
the <i>Live Court Show</i>, you know.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.473
Oh, I see.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.395
This is the spouse of Park Du-man,
President of People Media Group.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.231
And this is the spouse of
Min Yong-sik, Head of Minbo Group.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.024
-Sang-sook Kim.
-Pi Hyang-mi.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.943
I'm Kim Ga-on.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.987
You're the biggest star nowadays.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.197
How about a selfie together?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.115
Sounds good.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.784
-Let me join you.
-Sure, gather around.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.287
Girls, pose. How about a heart?

21:28.870 --> 21:30.080
Okay.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.915
How about a heart? Okay.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.210
About your hair…

21:35.294 --> 21:38.005
Don't you think he'll look more stylish
if he showed more of his forehead?

21:38.088 --> 21:41.049
No, he has good features.
I think it's more the clothes.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.302
Yes, this is rather old.
Where did you get this?

21:43.385 --> 21:44.928
It's like an old man's.
Why not take it off for a second?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.055
-Wait, what brand is this?
-Remove it for a second.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.308
Remove it. Just for one moment, I…

21:49.391 --> 21:51.393
-Come on, take it off.
-Please excuse me.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.521
He needs to meet many people today,

21:54.604 --> 21:56.857
-so let me borrow him for a second.
-Sure.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.984
Bye!

22:04.239 --> 22:05.657
He's such a kid.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.285
I wonder if he'll manage to hold out
under Kang Yo-han.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.078
-He's cute, right?
-Yes..

22:10.871 --> 22:11.913
-Nice.
-Yes.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.876
So his guardian is here.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.718
I don't need a guardian.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.096
You looked like a cub
surrounded by lionesses back there.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.807
-Why am I a cub…
-You're here.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.727
My goodness! What is this ray of light?
Judge Kang!

22:34.811 --> 22:36.021
Come sit down.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.316
Thanks to you handsome judges,

22:39.399 --> 22:41.318
my station is managing to hold on.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.403
I'm Park Du-man.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.947
Sounds like the advertisements
have been bringing in good money.

22:46.031 --> 22:50.368
Yes, they have. And of course,
we can give more in that way.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.661
How crude.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.790
This man who's picking a fight
with me right now

22:54.873 --> 22:56.124
is from the Minbo Group.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.294
They're just a tiny business.
He's the president there, Min Yong-sik.

23:02.130 --> 23:02.964
I'm Kim Ga-on.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.258
So you're the famous Judge Kim.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.427
Why don’t you join our coterie?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.387
What exactly do you mean by…

23:09.471 --> 23:11.932
A social club where
we discuss national affairs.

23:12.015 --> 23:14.559
All the leaders from the financial,
political and academic spheres

23:14.643 --> 23:16.603
meet together to learn
about global trends.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.563
Sometimes we invite lecturers too.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.774
That's how we spend our time.

23:20.857 --> 23:25.112
A simple businessman like me, however,
only finds it a headache.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.698
So you do know you're a simple man,
President Park.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.408
That's very smart of you.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.330
Mr. President!

23:39.668 --> 23:40.752
Don't make me laugh.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.047
Let's go.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.758
I should head over there too.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.512
I'd like to call on
our distinguished donors

23:50.595 --> 23:53.557
of the Dream Base project.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.810
First, our donors who kindly
put forward 100 million won.

24:04.860 --> 24:08.113
Next, our donors who graciously
put forward one billion won.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.447
Could you please stand up?

24:16.204 --> 24:20.041
We also saw some immense acts of love.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.294
We have a donor
who put forward 10 billion won.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.879
Where are you?

24:26.756 --> 24:28.633
Please give him a big round of applause.

24:42.522 --> 24:43.565
Everyone,

24:44.608 --> 24:47.027
please now welcome Chairman Seo Jeong-hak.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.300
Virtue!

25:12.928 --> 25:15.222
The power to overcome
this national calamity

25:16.389 --> 25:18.266
all boils down to

25:19.100 --> 25:20.310
this one word, "virtue."

25:21.228 --> 25:25.065
And then, the innate quality of
what makes us human.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.443
It's also mentioned in the first passage

25:28.526 --> 25:30.111
of <i>The Works of Mencius</i>.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.697
Compassion.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.660
Without a heart of sympathy,

25:36.743 --> 25:38.954
you cannot call yourself human!

25:39.537 --> 25:41.206
And we mustn't forget,

25:41.790 --> 25:45.919
that this is the essence
of our foundation!

26:01.434 --> 26:02.435
Oh, please.

26:02.519 --> 26:03.812
He was so good at it too.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.398
Please.

26:06.481 --> 26:08.775
I'm dying. Here, have a grape.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.903
Did the Chairman even donate?

26:11.987 --> 26:12.821
Who knows?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.199
Gosh, he's here.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.749
-His speech today was so inspiring.
-Yes.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.795
Chairman, as always,
that was very inspiring.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.089
Compassion. It's just as you said.

26:31.172 --> 26:34.551
Without compassion for our people,
how can we expect our country to function?

26:34.634 --> 26:35.885
In that sense,

26:36.553 --> 26:39.764
I will put my body and soul
into this Dream Base project,

26:40.598 --> 26:44.227
and I will be there to back it up
with all my best.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.603
Thank you, Mr. President.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.731
-Please.
-Mr. President,

26:47.814 --> 26:49.441
I find you quite foreign today.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.694
Why so?

26:52.777 --> 26:54.904
I'm always all about our country.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.042
Now, let's leave that
until after we finish eating.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.460
Bring us the food!

27:17.052 --> 27:18.261
Thank you.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.596
Thank you.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.099
Thank you.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.352
Let's eat, then.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.949
I'm so sorry.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.160
Take your time.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.419
Take your time, it's fine.

27:54.881 --> 27:55.840
Yes, take your time.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.927
Slowly now.

28:08.436 --> 28:09.354
Chairman Seo.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.315
What is it?

28:13.525 --> 28:16.403
I'm sorry, but there's an urgent call.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.280
Is there?

28:19.364 --> 28:22.325
Please excuse us first.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.870
Well, about that……

29:10.039 --> 29:13.585
Damn it…

29:15.211 --> 29:16.629
Pardon me all to hell.

29:16.713 --> 29:20.216
This senile body of mine
would still continue to sin…

29:20.300 --> 29:21.676
Old geezer.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.678
Yes.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.184
Why can't you stay modest
for even just an hour?

29:30.059 --> 29:32.103
-What should we do about you?
-I'm sorry.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.606
I'm sorry.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.316
I'm sorry…

29:36.816 --> 29:38.359
Repent.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.487
Repent.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.529
Repent!

29:42.155 --> 29:44.699
Repent!

29:45.658 --> 29:46.659
Repent!

29:47.494 --> 29:48.620
Repent!

29:53.082 --> 29:54.375
Tell me, who are you?

29:54.459 --> 29:55.919
I'm just a dog.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.546
Oh, please.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.133
You're a poverty activist and were even
shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.635
No, I'm just a dog.

30:03.718 --> 30:07.180
Why is our national advisor and
great philosopher being so humble?

30:07.263 --> 30:10.016
No, ma'am. I'm just a scumbag
who's deceived the entire world

30:10.099 --> 30:12.560
my whole life, behind my treacherous mask.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.355
Look.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.525
Aren't you Chairman Seo,
the true power of the country,

30:18.608 --> 30:22.070
-even untouchable by the President?
-No, I've merely been harassing

30:22.153 --> 30:24.489
powerless women,
hiding behind my deceitful name…

30:29.786 --> 30:30.870
I'm sorry.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.626
I'm sorry, please kill me.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.270
-Old geezer.
-Yes?

30:56.354 --> 30:59.065
There's something you're mistaken about.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.359
You think dogs

31:02.443 --> 31:03.820
can ravage humans

31:04.571 --> 31:07.657
by biting them?

31:08.283 --> 31:11.744
When they're mere dogs?

31:13.204 --> 31:14.205
Yes, ma'am.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.999
You're absolutely right.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.545
Let's repent.

31:20.628 --> 31:23.089
How about we make it a month this time?

31:23.172 --> 31:26.175
I'll tell them you're fasting
for our country, once again.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.094
Yes, ma'am.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.766
Did it hurt?

31:34.434 --> 31:35.518
I must say, Judge Kang.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.229
I like how you don't hold back
with your trials.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.649
Honestly, we're very touched
when we think about

31:41.733 --> 31:45.653
how you grew up to be so fine despite
that tragedy you suffered ten years ago.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.283
Please, you flatter me.
It's all thanks to you, gentlemen.

31:50.366 --> 31:52.994
Yes, every time I see Judge Kang,

31:53.077 --> 31:54.621
my eyes tear up.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.497
Us especially, we have a reason to.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.589
But after this recent trial,

32:04.672 --> 32:06.007
many around me…

32:06.090 --> 32:08.968
not me, but my acquaintances
have been quite concerned.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.721
With so much apprehension
in our communities,

32:11.804 --> 32:15.016
did you have to make such a fuss
out of something like that?

32:16.434 --> 32:19.562
Young-min is a former classmate of
my son, so I know him very well.

32:19.646 --> 32:23.691
He'd been so bright and adorable
when he was little. It's a pity, really.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.902
I'm sorry, but with the trial still--

32:25.985 --> 32:29.781
It's a violation of judicial independence.
Is that what you're trying to say?

32:31.532 --> 32:34.619
With our country in this state,
shouldn't state affairs come first?

32:34.702 --> 32:37.413
Many of our Foundation's directors
haven't been too pleased.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.208
They are curious if the <i>Live Court Show</i>
is truly serving its original intentions.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.461
And if Judge Kang will take responsibility
if things get out of hand

32:43.544 --> 32:46.089
by continuing provocation
of the common people.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.719
Excuse me,
but what are you implying, exactly?

32:56.349 --> 32:58.601
He doesn't know
when to butt in and when not to.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.777
Does it have to be Cha Gyeong-hui?

33:14.909 --> 33:16.369
Just what do you…

33:24.377 --> 33:26.129
You know very well what I mean.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.299
Cha Gyeong-hui has many enemies,
and many faults too.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.261
Yet does it have to be Cha Gyeong-hui

33:34.012 --> 33:36.055
who guards your wealth?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.436
-Honey.
-Wait.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.230
Wait, wait.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.192
That was a big one, Judge Kang.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.527
You win hands down.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.904
I must say, you're one ingenious psycho.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.866
You're one creative lunatic!

33:57.618 --> 33:59.245
But you're right.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.956
It doesn't have to be Cha Gyeong-hui.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.584
For the next presidency, I mean.
Don't you agree?

34:04.667 --> 34:06.502
Someone who is popular

34:06.586 --> 34:09.088
with the common people,
and with a solid story to tell.

34:09.172 --> 34:12.842
That's the kind of person
that this generation wants.

34:12.925 --> 34:16.095
That's how I managed to
become president myself!

34:24.062 --> 34:26.147
From a businessman's point of view,

34:26.230 --> 34:28.733
it's always best to vote on the survivor.

34:28.816 --> 34:31.611
But there's no way to tell
who'll be left standing just yet.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.197
The man that's left standing?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.699
If you put it like that, President Park,

34:36.783 --> 34:39.202
you'll only offend the target
of your words,

34:39.285 --> 34:41.829
making you the bad guy. So eat your words!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.791
How was that for rhyming?
Words, words, words!

34:45.374 --> 34:48.878
You'll make a fine rapper too.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.047
Rhyme, lime… Hey, here's some actual lime!

36:02.118 --> 36:03.995
You're not feeling too well, are you?

36:05.746 --> 36:06.789
Director Jung.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.172
Don't you find Judge Kang you saw here

36:14.255 --> 36:15.631
a little foreign?

36:17.550 --> 36:18.593
What do you mean?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.930
I merely run errands for Chairman Seo,

36:23.014 --> 36:25.766
but there are things
I do come to perceive and hear.

36:25.850 --> 36:30.521
And I must say,
he's quite different to his public image…

36:33.816 --> 36:35.860
Is there something you'd like to tell me?

36:39.113 --> 36:40.740
I promise to keep it confidential.

36:44.660 --> 36:48.122
Have you heard about the fire that broke
out at a cathedral ten years ago?

36:48.206 --> 36:49.123
Yes.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.210
Though it was never reported,
the truth is…

36:53.419 --> 36:57.298
An MoU signing event had been taking place
that day with Judge Kang's older brother,

36:57.381 --> 36:59.300
<i>agreeing to donate his entire wealth
to our foundation.</i>

36:59.383 --> 37:02.553
-Mr. Kang Yi-sak?
-But then a fire broke out that day.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.891
<i>Because the cathedral was so old,
it completely burned down, trapping many.</i>

37:06.974 --> 37:09.227
Mr. Kang and his spouse
passed away that day too.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.564
Judge Kang was miraculously rescued
and the first thing he did

37:14.649 --> 37:17.151
after his discharge from the hospital was…

37:18.277 --> 37:19.362
What was it?

37:20.613 --> 37:23.658
He nullified the MoU
signed by his brother.

37:23.741 --> 37:27.328
He even submitted a note from his doctor
that Yi-sak was mentally incapacitated

37:27.411 --> 37:29.372
and was not able to make sound decisions.

37:31.916 --> 37:35.086
Do you think that's something
a normal person would do?

37:35.586 --> 37:39.131
Especially right after the tragic deaths
of his brother and his sister-in-law?

37:40.466 --> 37:43.844
Every time I watch the <i>Live Court Show</i>,
I'm reminded of that time

37:44.762 --> 37:46.681
and that gives me mixed feelings.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.111
Why do you look so gloomy?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.240
Have you gone deaf too?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.545
What was that just now?

38:20.256 --> 38:22.049
You should have answered me then.

38:24.593 --> 38:25.886
What is it?

38:25.970 --> 38:28.389
Disappointed to see
the bare face of the world?

38:29.515 --> 38:31.225
You mean the bare face of the rich.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.353
Do you think the poor are any different?

38:35.438 --> 38:37.273
All men are equal…

38:40.651 --> 38:42.236
at least before greed and desire.

38:52.079 --> 38:55.207
<i>The Prosecution is yet to
modify their indictment</i>

38:55.291 --> 38:58.085
<i>on Lee Young-min's assault.</i>

38:58.169 --> 39:02.381
<i>Also, the criticisms
on the </i>Live Court Show<i> is elevating</i>

39:02.465 --> 39:04.592
<i>as they seem to pardoning him</i>

39:04.675 --> 39:06.886
<i>even though they should be

39:06.969 --> 39:09.555
<i>Minister Cha Gyeong-hui is
yet to comment on this.</i>

39:09.638 --> 39:11.682
-Turn it off.
<i>-However, many are interested…</i>

39:13.601 --> 39:15.561
Punish Lee Young-min!

39:15.644 --> 39:17.605
-Punish him!
-Punish him!

39:17.688 --> 39:19.815
We demand the Minister of Justice
to step down!

39:19.899 --> 39:21.317
-Step down!
-Step down!

39:21.901 --> 39:23.736
Punish Lee Young-min!

39:23.819 --> 39:25.696
-Punish him!
-Punish him!

39:25.780 --> 39:27.907
We demand the Minister of Justice
to step down!

39:27.990 --> 39:29.700
-Step down!
-Step down!

39:29.784 --> 39:31.827
Punish Lee Young-min!

39:45.424 --> 39:46.509
Step down!

39:46.592 --> 39:48.177
Step down!

39:48.260 --> 39:49.387
Step down!

39:49.887 --> 39:51.806
Step down right now!

39:51.889 --> 39:53.391
Step down!

39:53.474 --> 39:55.726
-Step down!
-Let go!

39:55.810 --> 39:58.479
We demand the Minister of Justice
to step down!

39:59.480 --> 40:01.649
We demand the Minister of Justice
to step down!

40:17.581 --> 40:19.166
Those crazy imbeciles.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.215
What?

40:28.217 --> 40:29.385
Fine, then.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.351
Did the Foundation say something?

40:40.312 --> 40:42.648
Those little weasels…

40:42.731 --> 40:44.900
They've left me to deal with it on my own.

40:46.318 --> 40:48.195
Things aren't looking good, Minister.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.239
These are my conditions.

40:50.322 --> 40:52.741
Confess the truth about that case
to the media.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.160
Once you do,

40:54.243 --> 40:56.745
I'll let your son go.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.040
<i>What did Kang Yo-han demand, anyway?</i>

41:00.791 --> 41:03.502
From how he agreed to meet you,
there's something he wants.

41:06.005 --> 41:09.133
I don't mind selling off
our company for this.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.969
Let's protect Young-min.

41:12.928 --> 41:15.389
We're also to blame
for how he turned out like this.

41:17.057 --> 41:18.976
We were too busy with our own affairs

41:19.059 --> 41:21.270
and left him all alone since he was young.

41:21.937 --> 41:24.565
We failed to realize how much
of a hard time he was having.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.693
Do you remember that day
when he overdosed on those pills?

41:27.776 --> 41:29.778
Saying he'd rather die?

41:29.862 --> 41:31.864
Why are you bringing that up again?

41:33.032 --> 41:35.743
I don't even want to think about that.

41:35.826 --> 41:36.827
Honey!

41:36.911 --> 41:40.122
Are money and titles so important?

41:40.206 --> 41:42.958
Please, let's protect our child.

41:46.712 --> 41:50.549
He won't last one day in prison.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.178
My poor son…

41:59.016 --> 42:01.310
I mean, what's more important
than our own child?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.609
Honey. Please…

42:08.692 --> 42:11.529
I'll protect Young-min.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.368
Even if it means sacrificing myself.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.664
The trial's tomorrow.

42:22.665 --> 42:25.084
It should all go fine, right?

42:25.167 --> 42:26.877
-Hey.
-What is it? What?

42:26.961 --> 42:29.338
Minister Cha is having a press conference.

42:29.421 --> 42:30.422
What?

42:33.676 --> 42:35.052
<i>My fellow Koreans.</i>

42:36.262 --> 42:39.473
<i>I stand before you today
with a heavy heart.</i>

42:40.516 --> 42:42.017
<i>I deeply apologize</i>

42:42.101 --> 42:44.562
for troubling you all
with my son's affairs,

42:45.521 --> 42:46.981
due to my own negligence.

42:48.274 --> 42:51.277
I am to blame for failing
to raise my son properly.

43:01.870 --> 43:04.665
HEAD JUDGE KANG YO-HAN

43:11.755 --> 43:12.923
<i>Today,</i>

43:13.507 --> 43:18.012
the Prosecution has submitted
their revised indictment for Lee.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.848
They have revised the charges
to habitual assault,

43:20.931 --> 43:23.517
and have included all offenses
that have been recently exposed.

43:24.518 --> 43:27.021
-What? What's she saying?
<i>-I will wait in court tomorrow</i>

43:27.104 --> 43:29.481
to see that he is severely punished.

43:29.565 --> 43:31.358
Mom…

43:31.442 --> 43:33.819
<i>I will not dare beg for forgiveness.</i>

43:33.902 --> 43:36.780
So her political aspirations
prevailed against motherly love.

43:37.364 --> 43:40.534
Dad, that's not how it's supposed to be.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.162
This isn't what you told me!

43:43.245 --> 43:46.081
This isn't how it's supposed to be.
So what the hell was that?

43:46.165 --> 43:48.208
Young-min. Calm down, Young-min.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.918
What is it?

43:50.002 --> 43:52.296
Is it your head? Does it hurt?

43:52.379 --> 43:53.881
Your medication.

43:57.676 --> 43:58.844
Here, take your medicine.

43:58.927 --> 44:00.262
<i>Those who have sinned,</i>

44:00.346 --> 44:02.598
<i>-whoever that may be…</i>
-Breathe in deeply.

44:02.681 --> 44:06.935
<i>must be rightfully punished,
and that is my unwavering principle.</i>

44:07.019 --> 44:10.230
<i>That is also
the Republic of Korea I envision.</i>

44:12.650 --> 44:15.903
HEAD JUDGE KANG YO-HAN

44:21.408 --> 44:23.243
After all I've done to come this far…

44:27.206 --> 44:29.541
There is no glory to be won
without sacrifice.

44:58.695 --> 44:59.780
Hey, Su-hyeon.

45:03.534 --> 45:07.413
My client is deeply remorseful
for his crimes.

45:07.496 --> 45:11.375
However, please understand that
there were extenuating circumstances,

45:11.458 --> 45:12.668
Your Honor.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.545
What circumstances, exactly?

45:14.628 --> 45:16.880
My client has been extremely
sensitive as a child,

45:16.964 --> 45:18.715
due to his lonely upbringing.

45:18.799 --> 45:20.300
Normally, you'd expect any child

45:20.384 --> 45:22.845
to grow up showered with love
from his parents.

45:22.928 --> 45:23.846
Of course.

45:23.929 --> 45:26.807
-Are there children who are not?
-Exactly, Your Honor.

45:26.890 --> 45:29.017
But unfortunately,

45:29.101 --> 45:32.521
my client had to give up his parents
for our society.

45:32.604 --> 45:35.983
His mother and father, as a public servant
and the pillar of our economy,

45:36.066 --> 45:37.901
had no time for him,

45:37.985 --> 45:40.696
too occupied with their service
for our nation.

45:40.779 --> 45:43.323
Goodness, I'm sorry to hear that.

45:43.407 --> 45:44.533
Yes, Judge Kang.

45:45.784 --> 45:46.827
Your Honor?

45:47.494 --> 45:51.123
As his parents, we are to blame
for his misconduct.

45:51.206 --> 45:54.710
-Therefore we ask you to show mercy.
-Yes, Your Honor.

45:54.793 --> 45:57.504
My client grew up lonely in that big house

45:57.588 --> 46:00.132
with just the housemaid caring for him.

46:00.215 --> 46:03.677
To be more precise, that's two housemaids,
one cook, and one gardener.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.387
Though that's not so important.

46:05.471 --> 46:06.763
Yes, that's right.

46:07.431 --> 46:09.766
Also, my client was forced to witness

46:09.850 --> 46:12.686
the housemaids stealing articles
from his house.

46:12.769 --> 46:16.064
It's no surprise that
he came to harbor fear for the poor.

46:16.148 --> 46:20.360
This is how he came to be stricken with
a victim mentality and became aggressive.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.779
To support these claims,
I submit as evidence notes

46:22.863 --> 46:26.700
from renowned child psychologists
and psychiatrists for your reference.

46:40.339 --> 46:41.381
It's tough, isn't it?

46:42.466 --> 46:44.218
Tough?

46:44.301 --> 46:46.053
It was tougher being a detective.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.932
I'm sure you know better than I do,
Detective Yoon.

46:50.015 --> 46:50.849
Sure.

46:50.933 --> 46:53.560
Anyway, why are you bringing up
the past, all of a sudden?

46:54.895 --> 46:56.313
The court's no different.

46:56.396 --> 46:57.523
What?

46:58.482 --> 47:02.027
The Supreme Court is asking me to go find
some PR material for my boss.

47:02.110 --> 47:04.029
They want to strike while the iron's hot.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.369
The newbies have it hard anywhere.

47:11.203 --> 47:15.123
Then again, a survivor of a tragic fire
sounds like a perfect story

47:15.791 --> 47:17.292
to win anyone over.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.213
So it was a cathedral, was it?

47:22.881 --> 47:24.049
Yes.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.802
The whole family attended there
since his father was young.

47:27.594 --> 47:31.431
According to our findings however,
there wasn't even mass that day.

47:31.515 --> 47:35.435
It was some kind of a charity event
with an unclear list of attendees.

47:41.149 --> 47:42.359
Well…

47:42.442 --> 47:45.529
But what's that got to do with PR?

47:45.612 --> 47:48.949
We were just wondering if there are
any episodes, for possible interviews.

47:49.616 --> 47:53.829
Anyway, I hear the cause of the fire
was never identified.

47:55.372 --> 47:59.084
Yes, the building was a school
before it was renovated,

47:59.835 --> 48:01.295
and built entirely of wood.

48:01.378 --> 48:04.715
So everything burned down to the ground,
leaving nothing to work with.

48:06.216 --> 48:09.595
Had the curtains caught on fire
from a cigarette butt,

48:09.678 --> 48:11.972
or was it short-circuiting?

48:12.055 --> 48:14.391
You got a testimony
from Judge Kang, right?

48:14.474 --> 48:16.643
Did he ever say he saw anything?

48:16.727 --> 48:19.438
I did pay him a visit at the hospital,

48:19.521 --> 48:21.690
but he didn't seem to remember much.

48:21.773 --> 48:22.858
But then again,

48:22.941 --> 48:25.861
the roof collapsed on top of him,
and there was total chaos.

48:25.944 --> 48:30.198
Come to think of it, isn't today
the day of the <i>Live Court Show</i>?

48:30.866 --> 48:32.200
Why don't we watch it first?

48:35.746 --> 48:39.958
<i>Of course, they cannot justify
all of my client's actions.</i>

48:40.042 --> 48:44.212
<i>However, we are all responsible
for raising a child.</i>

48:44.296 --> 48:46.340
<i>If a child has gone astray,</i>

48:46.423 --> 48:49.801
is it truly the right answer
to isolate him from society?

48:49.885 --> 48:54.264
Your Honor. My son is still young and
is still inexperienced with his society.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.642
He was oblivious to his crimes.

48:56.725 --> 48:59.019
His parents failed to look after him.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.772
I presume he was never once
reprimanded by his parents.

49:01.855 --> 49:02.981
Yes, Your Honor.

49:03.065 --> 49:06.777
There is a saying,
"It takes a village to raise a child."

49:06.860 --> 49:09.029
So could we not embrace
his deviant behavior,

49:09.112 --> 49:11.448
which is due to the lack of affection

49:11.531 --> 49:15.702
and discipline from his parents,
with understanding?

49:16.953 --> 49:18.413
Young-min!

49:20.374 --> 49:22.167
My poor son…

49:22.250 --> 49:24.461
Your father is sorry.

49:24.544 --> 49:28.590
To lock up my client long-term
for a case such as this…

49:28.674 --> 49:31.343
How is this not emotional populism?

49:31.426 --> 49:33.720
Then again, prisons are not free.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.598
No, Your Honor.
It's all from our taxpayer's pockets.

49:36.682 --> 49:39.726
So wouldn't it be better off for my client

49:39.810 --> 49:42.312
to compensate the victims
adequately instead?

49:42.396 --> 49:43.897
Let me be blunt.

49:43.980 --> 49:45.982
Even if we put this man in prison,

49:46.066 --> 49:48.944
there will be nothing for our victims.

49:49.027 --> 49:51.321
These are hard times
for everyone, aren't they?

49:53.448 --> 49:54.449
A superb defense.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.326
I enjoyed that, Counsel.

49:56.410 --> 49:59.079
I apologize if I had gone
a little overboard, Your Honor.

49:59.162 --> 50:00.122
Oh, no.

50:00.914 --> 50:03.583
It was very rational.
A very reasonable defense,

50:03.667 --> 50:05.127
which I highly agree with.

50:08.505 --> 50:10.340
While hearing your claims,

50:10.424 --> 50:14.511
I was reminded of a penalty
that befits this case.

50:14.594 --> 50:16.638
A penalty that won't cost our taxpayers,

50:16.722 --> 50:19.474
nor isolate him long-term from society,
and will only inflict

50:19.558 --> 50:23.270
the pain he rightfully deserves
in the shortest time frame possible.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.689
A most efficient
and economical punishment.

50:29.484 --> 50:30.569
Flogging.

50:30.652 --> 50:31.862
Pardon?

50:32.487 --> 50:33.613
Flogging?

50:35.949 --> 50:40.662
Wow! Oh man… That's it.

50:40.746 --> 50:41.788
<i>Just as you said,</i>

50:41.872 --> 50:44.833
<i>our Defendant never received
love or discipline from his parents,</i>

50:44.916 --> 50:47.377
<i>so we, the society,
will assume that role instead.</i>

50:47.461 --> 50:50.630
<i>Didn't you say it takes
a village to raise a child?</i>

50:50.714 --> 50:51.923
Flogging?

50:52.007 --> 50:53.133
-Hey.
-Yes?

50:53.216 --> 50:55.469
-Look up it and bring it up on the screen.
-Yes, sir.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.263
But that's just mad!

50:58.346 --> 51:00.599
Tie up someone and flog him
in this 21st Century?

51:00.682 --> 51:02.225
That's just barbaric.

51:02.309 --> 51:05.061
That would be an insult
to many exemplary countries

51:05.145 --> 51:07.773
who practice it as a form of
punishment to this day.

51:07.856 --> 51:10.275
What's more, it's also grounded

51:10.358 --> 51:12.611
on the special law for reinforcing
law and order

51:12.694 --> 51:15.614
<i>which the Defendant's mother,
Minister Cha, is pushing for.</i>

51:16.615 --> 51:17.824
<i>Wouldn't you agree?</i>

51:17.908 --> 51:19.826
That crazy bastard!

51:23.121 --> 51:24.539
Your Honor.

51:25.373 --> 51:27.417
I apologize.

51:27.501 --> 51:29.294
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

51:29.377 --> 51:32.547
My deepest apologies to all the victims.

51:32.631 --> 51:35.050
I've been living my life wrong
this entire time.

51:35.133 --> 51:37.886
I apologize.
Please have mercy on me, just this once.

51:37.969 --> 51:39.805
I'm really sorry.

51:40.347 --> 51:43.517
-I apologize.
-Then how about we ask our people?

51:43.600 --> 51:44.434
Well?

51:44.518 --> 51:47.938
Do you believe this is condign
punishment for our defendant?

51:49.105 --> 51:50.398
Your Honor…

51:50.482 --> 51:52.776
Punish Lee Young-min!

51:52.859 --> 51:54.486
Punish him!

51:54.569 --> 51:56.571
We demand the Minister of Justice
to step down!

51:56.655 --> 51:57.864
CLOSE FOR BUSINESS

51:59.199 --> 52:00.492
I voted.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.495
Me, too. I hope justice prevails.

52:17.425 --> 52:21.054
GUILTY

52:38.572 --> 52:42.784
Who are you to judge me?

52:43.952 --> 52:46.371
-Hey! Young-min! Calm down.
-Get off me!

52:46.454 --> 52:49.416
-Young-min!
-Get off me.

52:49.499 --> 52:50.542
Young-min.

52:51.209 --> 52:53.670
You think you're any better?

52:53.753 --> 52:55.881
What makes you think
you're any better than me?

52:56.756 --> 52:58.675
How are you different from me?

52:59.467 --> 53:01.595
-Are you that honest?
-Young-min!

53:01.678 --> 53:04.806
Do you think this makes sense?

53:04.890 --> 53:07.475
Camera One, focus on Lee Young-min.

53:07.559 --> 53:08.935
-Keep following him.
-Yes, sir.

53:09.019 --> 53:11.730
Camera Three,
get a bust shot of Lee's father.

53:11.813 --> 53:14.774
What makes you better than me?

53:15.442 --> 53:17.694
What did I do so wrong?

53:17.777 --> 53:19.154
You're the same, aren't you?

53:19.237 --> 53:21.740
You, you, and you. All of you!

53:22.240 --> 53:26.036
And you, all of you!
How are you different from me?

53:30.206 --> 53:31.750
Just who are you…

53:32.876 --> 53:34.002
to judge me?

53:34.753 --> 53:36.421
I said I apologize.

53:37.923 --> 53:40.800
I even went to such lengths, apologizing…

53:40.884 --> 53:43.386
Your Honor! Let me get down on my knees

53:43.470 --> 53:45.597
and apologize to you.

53:46.514 --> 53:50.060
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Please have mercy on me, just this once!

53:50.143 --> 53:52.395
I'm truly sorry.
Please have mercy, Your Honor!

53:52.479 --> 53:54.230
Please spare me, Your Honor.

53:54.314 --> 53:55.982
I'm really sorry, so just this once…

53:56.066 --> 53:58.777
Please forgive me just this once
and let me go, please.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.488
I'm so sorry.

54:02.447 --> 54:04.491
Forgive me just this once, Your Honor.

54:06.451 --> 54:09.412
Answering the will of our people,

54:09.496 --> 54:11.957
this court sentences the defendant to

54:13.041 --> 54:14.668
thirty floggings.

54:16.169 --> 54:17.462
Your Honor…

54:17.545 --> 54:19.756
Compared to your past misdemeanors,

54:19.839 --> 54:22.759
the court believes it to be
minimal humane punishment.

54:23.677 --> 54:25.595
As this is a punishment by our people,

54:25.679 --> 54:28.181
it is right that
the sentence be carried out publicly

54:28.264 --> 54:31.393
and transparently
for the entire nation to watch.

54:31.476 --> 54:34.562
I urge the Ministry of Justice to
take note before executing the sentence.

54:42.779 --> 54:45.407
30 FLOGGINGS

54:50.370 --> 54:51.997
Serves him right!

54:52.080 --> 54:55.041
That scumbag ought to be
beaten like a dog.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.419
Yes, a man like him
ought to be our president.

54:57.502 --> 54:59.713
So he can wipe out
all the trash in our country.

55:01.172 --> 55:02.632
Are you aware that Judge Kang

55:02.716 --> 55:05.051
canceled his brother's pledge
to donate his wealth

55:05.719 --> 55:07.345
once he was out of the hospital?

55:08.096 --> 55:10.265
Why are you saying something so random?

55:10.348 --> 55:13.059
Random?

55:13.935 --> 55:16.062
This may be a motive for the crime.

55:17.063 --> 55:18.231
You're calling it random?

55:19.399 --> 55:21.359
What's with you? Are you out of your mind?

55:21.443 --> 55:24.654
Are you slandering that man?
You'll be stoned to death, you know!

55:24.738 --> 55:28.867
There are many people trying their best to
live in this shitty world thanks to him.

55:28.950 --> 55:30.744
That's enough.

55:30.827 --> 55:31.995
Let's go.

55:38.084 --> 55:40.420
That's right, Detective Park.

55:40.503 --> 55:42.505
How did you manage to
open this restaurant?

55:42.589 --> 55:45.592
How else?
With my severance pay, of course.

55:45.675 --> 55:46.760
Well, that's odd.

55:47.427 --> 55:50.722
Because according to my research,
you were heavily in debt.

55:51.514 --> 55:54.726
Gambling, right? After closing the case
without identifying the cause,

55:54.809 --> 55:57.854
you resigned two months later
and managed to clear your debt.

55:57.937 --> 56:00.190
Then you opened a restaurant
at a popular spot.

56:02.150 --> 56:04.861
That must have been
some good severance pay,

56:04.944 --> 56:06.529
Detective Park.

56:15.663 --> 56:18.291
ORDER OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE

56:25.006 --> 56:27.133
Minister Cha.
I know this is difficult for you,

56:27.217 --> 56:29.219
but we need you to sign the paper.

56:31.513 --> 56:33.139
If you withdraw now…

56:49.114 --> 56:52.742
ORDER OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE

57:01.793 --> 57:03.586
ORDER OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE

57:34.826 --> 57:36.911
Hold on.

57:36.995 --> 57:37.912
Wait.

57:44.836 --> 57:48.465
LIVE: FLOGGING OF LEE YOUNG-MIN,
VICE PRESIDENT OF JOONGWON F&B

57:49.466 --> 57:51.092
Young-min.

57:51.176 --> 57:53.303
-Young-min!
-Dad…

57:59.309 --> 58:00.852
Wait.

58:11.362 --> 58:13.156
We will execute the sentence now.

58:14.199 --> 58:15.200
Let's begin.

58:18.703 --> 58:21.289
Wait… wait.

58:35.512 --> 58:36.930
Young-min…

58:54.822 --> 58:56.950
President. President!

58:57.951 --> 58:58.910
President!

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:21.492
-Shall we resume next week?
-Yes, after treating him adequately,

1:00:21.576 --> 1:00:22.660
let's resume.

1:00:43.431 --> 1:00:44.474
Are you satisfied?

1:00:45.099 --> 1:00:46.559
Why wouldn't I be?

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:52.774
What kind of cruelty is this?

1:00:55.234 --> 1:00:59.072
Cruel? I was merely respecting
the wishes of the majority.

1:00:59.155 --> 1:01:02.241
-Isn't that what democracy is?
-Enough of your hypocrisy.

1:01:02.325 --> 1:01:04.619
I know you're only doing this for fun.

1:01:04.702 --> 1:01:07.163
You are just a cold-hearted monster.

1:01:09.707 --> 1:01:12.585
You hunt for fun, and eliminate,
if things get in your way.

1:01:15.213 --> 1:01:16.589
Including your brother too.

1:01:19.175 --> 1:01:21.427
Is that why you killed your brother too?

1:01:38.319 --> 1:01:39.445
Say that again.

1:01:40.697 --> 1:01:42.615
Is that why you killed your brother?

1:01:43.616 --> 1:01:44.867
Say that again.

1:01:45.910 --> 1:01:49.706
Your brother, who loved
and cared about you dearly…

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:55.294
Say that again. Again!

1:02:01.676 --> 1:02:02.802
Cruel?

1:02:03.678 --> 1:02:04.846
Cruel, did you say?

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:07.682
Do you know what real cruelty is?

1:02:32.457 --> 1:02:34.709
<i>After that man, my father, died…</i>

1:02:34.792 --> 1:02:38.129
<i>my brother pledged to donate
his entire wealth to the Foundation.</i>

1:02:38.212 --> 1:02:39.297
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOUNDATION
MOU EVENT

1:02:46.554 --> 1:02:49.557
<i>The foundation held a grand party for him,</i>

1:02:50.683 --> 1:02:54.312
<i>as if they were touched
by his great benevolence.</i>

1:02:54.854 --> 1:02:57.106
I know it was a difficult decision.

1:02:57.190 --> 1:02:58.232
Oh no, Chairman.

1:02:58.316 --> 1:03:00.860
We respect you.
I know it wasn't an easy decision.

1:03:00.943 --> 1:03:02.862
Voiding yourself of worldly desires

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:05.907
and giving love is extremely
difficult to do, wouldn't you agree?

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:08.826
Gosh, you must be Elijah.

1:03:08.910 --> 1:03:09.994
How adorable.

1:03:10.077 --> 1:03:13.581
Child, do you know what
a respectable man your father is?

1:03:13.664 --> 1:03:15.625
He is a living saint!

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:18.169
-Saint? Please.
-You are truly admirable.

1:03:18.252 --> 1:03:20.588
Goodness, is she a living doll?

1:03:20.671 --> 1:03:22.673
You're just so adorable!

1:03:22.757 --> 1:03:24.634
How about you sign with our agency?

1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:26.969
Don't do that to her.

1:03:27.053 --> 1:03:28.513
Hey, hey!

1:03:28.596 --> 1:03:29.764
Come here!

1:03:29.847 --> 1:03:31.808
-Don't run.
-Hey!

1:03:33.935 --> 1:03:35.853
ST. VERENA'S CATHEDRAL

1:03:37.063 --> 1:03:39.273
-Why did you come out?
-Let's go.

1:03:41.234 --> 1:03:42.944
Uncle will go inside soon,

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:44.487
so ahead first to Daddy.

1:03:44.570 --> 1:03:47.031
-All right?
-Make sure you hurry up.

1:03:47.114 --> 1:03:47.949
All right.

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:51.744
Hey.

1:03:53.871 --> 1:03:55.832
So you're going to sign with us, are you?

1:03:57.375 --> 1:03:59.126
You're so adorable.

1:04:22.275 --> 1:04:23.860
How much is all that?

1:04:23.943 --> 1:04:26.445
I don't know, but probably billions.

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:31.158
They're making such a fuss,
asking everyone to do so much.

1:04:31.242 --> 1:04:34.245
In just an hour or so,
the Foundation will have billions.

1:04:34.829 --> 1:04:36.372
So bear it for just a minute.

1:04:36.956 --> 1:04:38.708
Let's pray that our Father

1:04:38.791 --> 1:04:42.837
will accept this contribution
by Kang Yi-sak, also known as Isaac,

1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:45.756
and Yoo Hee-jin, also known as Cecilia.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:48.634
-Amen.
-Amen.

1:04:48.718 --> 1:04:51.053
-Corpus Christi…
-Is Elijah here?

1:04:51.679 --> 1:04:53.347
Corpus Christi.

1:04:55.308 --> 1:04:57.018
Corpus Christi.

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:00.313
Corpus Christi.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:04.275
Corpus Christi.

1:05:06.193 --> 1:05:07.820
Corpus Christi.

1:05:11.949 --> 1:05:13.409
Corpus Christi.

1:05:29.717 --> 1:05:30.843
Mommy!

1:05:40.311 --> 1:05:42.355
Honey. Honey!

1:05:43.606 --> 1:05:45.149
Mommy!

1:07:18.451 --> 1:07:19.660
Elijah!

1:07:20.286 --> 1:07:23.581
-Elijah!
-Move. Move!

1:07:33.924 --> 1:07:35.342
That crazy bastard!

1:07:39.555 --> 1:07:40.598
Who are you?

1:07:45.770 --> 1:07:47.354
Mommy…

1:07:48.731 --> 1:07:50.107
Mommy…

1:08:00.242 --> 1:08:01.744
Mommy!

1:08:25.392 --> 1:08:27.311
-Elijah!
-Mommy!

1:08:27.394 --> 1:08:28.604
Elijah!

1:08:30.147 --> 1:08:32.858
-Are you all right, Elijah?
-Elijah!

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:34.985
Come with Mommy and Daddy.

1:08:39.115 --> 1:08:40.574
Out of my way!

1:08:40.658 --> 1:08:42.743
Out of my way! Do you want to die?

1:09:19.864 --> 1:09:21.240
Yo-han.

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:44.180
Elijah…

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:46.223
Elijah…

1:10:25.888 --> 1:10:27.223
Yo-han…

1:10:30.976 --> 1:10:31.936
Go.

1:10:34.939 --> 1:10:36.065
Go…

1:10:51.830 --> 1:10:53.165
I'll be right back.

1:11:45.259 --> 1:11:46.302
Yi-sak…

1:11:54.810 --> 1:11:56.312
What are you doing?

1:12:00.149 --> 1:12:02.609
I'm sorry. I really am.

1:12:13.954 --> 1:12:15.122
Yi-sak…

1:12:54.661 --> 1:12:55.621
One comment, please!

1:12:55.704 --> 1:12:57.039
How do you feel?

1:12:57.122 --> 1:12:58.665
Here's a survivor!

1:13:01.126 --> 1:13:03.212
That must have been terrible.

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:14.676
I'm sorry.

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:16.803
I went too far.

1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:35.364
Men are…

1:15:38.283 --> 1:15:40.410
That's the kind of story they're after.

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:13.485
<i>The hunter thoroughly disguises his scent.</i>

1:16:14.653 --> 1:16:16.405
<i>Until the right day comes.</i>

1:16:16.488 --> 1:16:17.364
<i>How fun.</i>

1:16:17.447 --> 1:16:19.825
<i>I have no hesitation in removing</i>

1:16:19.908 --> 1:16:21.618
<i>whatever stands in my way.</i>

1:16:21.702 --> 1:16:24.454
It's like giving Kang Yo-han homework.

1:16:24.538 --> 1:16:26.707
<i>I need to find out
who's behind Cha Gyeong-hui.</i>

1:16:26.790 --> 1:16:28.458
<i>Let's strike the body first.</i>

1:16:28.542 --> 1:16:31.086
Even if no one else
in this world does, I do.

1:16:31.670 --> 1:16:32.879
<i>I understand that feeling.</i>

1:16:33.463 --> 1:16:34.339
<i>Anger.</i>

1:16:35.007 --> 1:16:37.718
<i>So make your choice.
Will you stand in my way</i>

1:16:37.801 --> 1:16:39.136
or stand with me?

1:16:40.429 --> 1:16:45.350
