00:03.235 --> 00:04.556
Why aren't you talking?

00:04.562 --> 00:06.042
Something's happening.

00:06.453 --> 00:08.713
What is happening, Tom? Why
are you being mysterious?

00:08.715 --> 00:10.415
Your whole job is to
tell me what's happening.

00:10.417 --> 00:12.607
I don't know, I've never
been to an auction before.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.445
- Everyone looks angry.
- At 1 million and 300 thousand dollars

00:15.451 --> 00:17.051
Looking for a rise of 50.

00:17.052 --> 00:20.103
We're at 1.3. Can I tell them
the house is on the market?

00:20.105 --> 00:22.053
Just take your time, Josh.
Don't let him pressure you.

00:22.059 --> 00:23.472
I don't think they're done yet.

00:23.478 --> 00:25.340
Letting them know we're on
the market will get things

00:25.346 --> 00:26.903
- moving again...
- Yeah, or we could just stop

00:26.909 --> 00:28.855
- there and it's done.
- Be strong, Josh, okay?

00:28.861 --> 00:30.268
Don't show weakness.

00:30.467 --> 00:32.863
Okay, no, I just... Yes,
fine, we're on the market.

00:32.869 --> 00:35.071
- That's below your reserve.
- Dad, fine. Please.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.589
Okay, let's just do this thing.

00:36.590 --> 00:39.084
Uh-oh. He's just
whispered something to her.

00:39.090 --> 00:41.972
- I know, Tom.
- We're selling. On the market...

00:41.978 --> 00:43.780
I think he whispered, "I love you."

00:43.786 --> 00:46.162
- Please shut up, okay?
- You wanted me to talk more!

00:46.168 --> 00:48.744
- Yeah.
- At 1 million and 3... At 1.350...

00:48.750 --> 00:51.004
Oh! It's up... it's up to 1.35.

00:52.766 --> 00:54.377
- What is he saying?
- Are they bidding?

00:54.383 --> 00:56.091
- Here, you just do it.
- Okay.

00:56.350 --> 00:58.094
- Talk to me, Tom.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

00:58.100 --> 01:02.509
- 1.4 now. At 1.4, I have...
- Gold sunglasses lady, 1.4 million.

01:02.510 --> 01:05.111
- Tom, don't sound excited.
- Oh, sorry, Alan.

01:05.117 --> 01:07.469
- It's good.
- That's... I mean, that is good.

01:07.470 --> 01:09.411
At 1 million and 500 thousand dollars.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.830
You'll never buy real estate
shaking your head that way.

01:11.836 --> 01:14.027
I think this is it, 1.5.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.652
1.5, they're selling.

01:16.755 --> 01:20.167
At 1 million and 500
thousand dollars, first call.

01:20.173 --> 01:21.418
She's doing the "going once" thing.

01:21.424 --> 01:23.952
- She's doing the "going once" thing.
- It's ending.

01:23.958 --> 01:27.934
At 1 million and 500 thousand
dollars. Are you all out?

01:27.940 --> 01:31.635
Done? At 1 million and
500 thousand dollars?

01:31.736 --> 01:34.862
- Sold! Congratulations and well bid.
- Sold!

01:34.868 --> 01:36.796
$1.5 million?

01:36.802 --> 01:39.568
We can scream now?

01:39.574 --> 01:41.988
Josh, 1 million and a half-"inaire"!

01:41.994 --> 01:44.629
Good result. Good result.

01:44.630 --> 01:47.005
Your mum's house is sold,
mate. Congratulations.

01:47.011 --> 01:48.909
Oh, I think I'm gonna
start crying again.

02:27.470 --> 02:29.158
Josh, I don't wanna be
difficult, but do you think

02:29.164 --> 02:30.884
maybe we could take
your mum off the table?

02:30.890 --> 02:32.430
Just put her on top of the fridge.

02:33.555 --> 02:35.533
Have you decided what
you're going to do with her?

02:35.950 --> 02:37.563
No, ah.

02:37.569 --> 02:39.809
- What did she like?
- Not much.

02:39.815 --> 02:42.958
- Me, she liked me.
- I'd like to live in a loft...

02:42.964 --> 02:44.415
with a ladder.

02:44.416 --> 02:46.144
Incredible. Like living in a ship.

02:46.150 --> 02:48.956
Sorry, Tom, Josh and I were just
having a chat about Josh's mum.

02:48.962 --> 02:50.954
Ugh! I'm sick of Josh's mum.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.412
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

02:52.418 --> 02:53.952
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Yeah.

02:53.958 --> 02:56.012
Uh, what were we saying about her?

02:56.222 --> 02:58.101
I'd like to add that
she was a good woman.

02:58.102 --> 02:59.733
Thank you. Thanks, Tom.

03:00.102 --> 03:01.729
Can we talk about living in a loft now?

03:01.735 --> 03:04.419
Tom, you absolutely would
not like living in a loft.

03:04.425 --> 03:05.879
Yeah, so what's happened
here is you've just found

03:05.885 --> 03:07.456
a loophole to never
have to leave your room.

03:07.462 --> 03:10.345
Also, I just don't think it's the
right time to move out and leave Josh.

03:10.351 --> 03:12.204
- Oh, he's fine.
- He's not fine.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.417
- He is so fine.
- Josh, are you fine?

03:14.423 --> 03:16.824
- Yeah.
- See? He's not fine.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.310
Harrumph!

03:19.518 --> 03:21.788
I just don't think there's that
much you can do, to be honest,

03:21.794 --> 03:24.250
because, like, I'm sad, you know,

03:24.256 --> 03:27.319
and... and sure, like, I guess I'll
admit that I've been struggling,

03:27.325 --> 03:32.237
but, also, my mum just killed herself.
And, like, that's... that's bad.

03:32.243 --> 03:34.714
You know? And that's
gonna be bad for a while.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.865
And I just sort of...
It seems right to be sad.

03:38.022 --> 03:40.272
So, what brings you here?

03:40.278 --> 03:41.782
Well, um, it's free.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.759
And also my dad was worried that,
'cause my mum committed suicide,

03:44.760 --> 03:46.783
that I was going to
commit suicide. But...

03:46.789 --> 03:50.359
the thing about that is that the
most efficient way for my parents

03:50.365 --> 03:52.768
to make me not want to do
something is for them to do it.

03:53.078 --> 03:54.380
Mm-hm.

03:55.364 --> 03:57.549
You think that's insight
'cause I mentioned my parents,

03:57.555 --> 04:00.477
but it's not insight, okay, I was
just... I was just being funny.

04:00.483 --> 04:02.021
I'm a... I'm a funny guy.

05:24.102 --> 05:28.342
Um, are you planning on going home
with our dear friend Joshua tonight?

05:28.730 --> 05:30.946
- I think so.
- Yes.

05:30.952 --> 05:34.245
Well, you'd better look after him,
Jason, 'cause he's a very fragile boy.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.954
I... I promise
I won't hurt him.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.221
Yeah, 'cause if you hurt him,
then you'll have to deal with us.

05:38.222 --> 05:40.435
You don't want to even know
what she's capable of, Jase.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.276
I'll be a proper gentleman.

05:42.282 --> 05:43.972
- I promise.
- No, that's not what I want!

05:43.978 --> 05:46.098
He gets really thirsty when
he wakes up in the morning,

05:46.104 --> 05:49.153
so, what you need to do is have
a glass of water, by his bed,

05:49.159 --> 05:50.714
- waiting for him in the morning.
- Ready.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.923
Aha.

05:52.022 --> 05:53.510
Are you crying again?

05:53.516 --> 05:55.101
Oh.

05:55.102 --> 05:56.661
Oh, no!

05:56.662 --> 05:58.501
No!

05:58.502 --> 06:00.767
What triggered the crying
this time? The water?

06:00.773 --> 06:03.084
I don't know, okay? My
emotions are out of control.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.671
Y'know, maybe I'm pregnant.

06:04.677 --> 06:06.161
His mum died.

06:06.859 --> 06:08.978
- Should I go?
- No! God, no.

06:08.984 --> 06:11.971
Please don't make me go to bed alone.

06:12.074 --> 06:14.562
You get him that water, understood?

06:14.669 --> 06:16.798
So, what do you imagine
were the reasons she had

06:16.804 --> 06:18.308
for choosing to end her life?

06:18.314 --> 06:21.661
I don't know. I googled,
"Why did Mum kill herself?"

06:21.662 --> 06:24.273
But it just told me why
other mums killed themselves.

06:24.369 --> 06:26.100
And now, whenever I go on the internet,
