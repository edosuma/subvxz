00:12.844 --> 00:16.245
Now, this is where we separate
the adults migratory males

00:16.314 --> 00:18.615
from the hatchlings.

00:33.865 --> 00:36.266
Private, what was that?

00:36.334 --> 00:38.135
Just observing the rules
of the road, Skipper.

00:38.202 --> 00:40.971
That is no way
to treat nitro-charged,

00:41.038 --> 00:43.340
fuel-injected,
motorized mayhem.

00:43.407 --> 00:44.574
Out of the car.

00:44.642 --> 00:47.644
Kowalski,
show him how it's done.

00:47.712 --> 00:50.647
Let's see,
fuel tank: Adequate.

00:50.715 --> 00:52.883
Tire pressure: Optimal.

00:52.950 --> 00:56.253
Altitude:
40 feet above sea level.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.487
Minimized freeways...

00:57.555 --> 00:59.055
Get out of the car.

00:59.123 --> 01:01.291
Rico, take the wheel.

01:01.359 --> 01:04.327
Vrroom, vroom-vroom-vroom.

01:04.394 --> 01:05.729
Now, pay attention.

01:05.796 --> 01:07.898
See how a real penguin drives.

01:10.535 --> 01:12.903
Whoo-hoo!

01:12.970 --> 01:15.772
That maniac sure loves
to rip up the road.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.806
Whoo!

01:16.874 --> 01:19.776
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:22.780 --> 01:24.281
Yeah.

01:24.348 --> 01:27.083
Ee-yaaah.

01:27.151 --> 01:29.352
Heh-hehhh.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.087
All right, wrap it up, Rico.

01:31.155 --> 01:32.889
Ohhh.

01:32.957 --> 01:34.457
And no, you can't have

01:34.525 --> 01:36.560
just one more spin
around the block.

01:36.627 --> 01:38.728
Please.

01:38.796 --> 01:41.431
That and your baby blues
won't cut it tonight, soldier.

01:41.499 --> 01:46.303
Lights out in ten.

01:46.370 --> 01:47.804
Oh, hello, Rico.

01:47.872 --> 01:50.507
I was just labeling
some of my inventions:

01:50.575 --> 01:51.808
The neuroneutralizer,

01:51.876 --> 01:54.110
the duotronic laser
targeting system,

01:54.178 --> 01:56.580
and the spectrodemagnitizer.

01:56.647 --> 01:58.481
At least I think
that's what these labels say.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.016
Hard to tell
when you can't read.

02:00.084 --> 02:01.484
Lights out, boys.

02:01.552 --> 02:03.220
Coming, Skipper.

02:03.287 --> 02:05.388
Bye-bye.

02:05.456 --> 02:08.324
Aww, come here.

02:08.392 --> 02:09.491
Smack!

02:09.560 --> 02:11.928
Rico.

02:16.667 --> 02:17.567
Huh? What?

02:17.635 --> 02:18.668
Baahh!

02:18.736 --> 02:19.669
Oof!

02:26.143 --> 02:28.278
Don't even think about it,
Rico.

02:28.346 --> 02:30.580
Aww.

02:33.150 --> 02:34.150
Whoo-hoo!

02:34.218 --> 02:38.521
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

02:38.589 --> 02:41.391
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah.

02:41.459 --> 02:44.995
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

02:47.298 --> 02:48.298
Yeow!

02:48.366 --> 02:49.566
Huh?

02:49.634 --> 02:53.403
Maurice, who is disturbing
my royal rest?

02:53.471 --> 02:54.404
Who?

02:54.472 --> 02:55.405
Who?

02:57.642 --> 03:00.310
Ohh, is it the penguin
in the car?

03:00.378 --> 03:03.513
Because I think it might be
the penguin in the car.

03:03.581 --> 03:05.615
Um, can I go back to bed now?

03:05.683 --> 03:10.020
No, I demand you punish him...
Savagely.

03:10.087 --> 03:11.788
And exactly just how am I
supposed to punish him?

03:15.559 --> 03:17.927
I mean, you know,
other than doing that,

03:18.029 --> 03:19.496
which I totally just did.

03:19.563 --> 03:22.232
Whoa, nice, Maurice.

03:22.300 --> 03:25.235
I don't know how you did it,
but I like the results.

03:25.303 --> 03:26.436
My pleasure.

03:26.504 --> 03:29.172
Okay, back to sleepytime,
everyone.

04:00.938 --> 04:01.971
Sorry.

Arrgh, mm.

04:09.113 --> 04:10.046
Ack!

04:10.114 --> 04:11.748
Up and at 'em, boys.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.283
Oh-ho,
looks like someone

04:13.351 --> 04:15.018
forgot his bright eyes
and bushy tail.

04:15.086 --> 04:17.487
Well, some more time
behind the wheel

04:17.555 --> 04:20.190
will put a little skip
in your step, right, Rico?

04:20.257 --> 04:22.192
Uh, yeah.

04:22.259 --> 04:23.526
Today's challenge:

04:23.594 --> 04:26.596
Navigate around the zoo
in a clockwise direction.

04:26.664 --> 04:28.064
Simple enough.

04:28.132 --> 04:31.167
Ah, making
only counterclockwise turns.

04:31.235 --> 04:32.268
Ooh, curve.

04:32.336 --> 04:33.570
That ante is upped.

04:33.637 --> 04:36.005
Rico, you're up.

04:39.877 --> 04:41.111
Whoa!

04:41.178 --> 04:43.213
Heh-heh.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.182
Hmm.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.617
Whoa!

04:47.685 --> 04:48.651
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

04:48.719 --> 04:53.957
Ah! Oh! Ah! Ohh!

04:54.024 --> 04:55.959
Is he doing it right, Skipper?

04:56.026 --> 04:58.928
Well, Rico's never one
to do things by the book.

04:58.996 --> 05:01.664
Ah! Ah! Augh! Ahh!

05:05.035 --> 05:06.736
Oh, no.

05:06.804 --> 05:07.737
Oy!

05:07.805 --> 05:09.072
If I didn't know better,

05:09.140 --> 05:10.607
I'd say that car's
got it in for Rico.

05:10.674 --> 05:13.910
Oh, private,
there you go anthropomorphizing

05:13.978 --> 05:16.012
the inanimate again.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.848
Well, that's a lot of egghead
jibber-jabber, Kowalski.

05:18.916 --> 05:22.051
That still doesn't tell me why
the car would be mad at Rico.

05:22.119 --> 05:24.621
I mean, it's not like
he secretly totaled the car

05:24.688 --> 05:26.723
and hastily slapped it
back together

05:26.791 --> 05:28.858
to cover his heinous crime,
right?

05:28.926 --> 05:30.827
Right...Ow!

No, no, Doris.

06:10.234 --> 06:12.068
Kowalski must never know.

Uh, Rico?

06:13.304 --> 06:14.370
Oogie-boogie,

What is it, boy?

06:21.078 --> 06:23.546
Our car is...Haunted?

06:23.614 --> 06:24.814
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:24.882 --> 06:26.850
Anthropomorphizing
with the added twist

06:26.917 --> 06:29.152
of supernatural possession.

06:29.220 --> 06:30.687
Preposterous.

06:30.754 --> 06:33.823
Actually,
Rico may be onto something.

06:33.891 --> 06:35.758
Our auto's gone loco.

06:35.826 --> 06:37.227
But that's impossible.

06:37.294 --> 06:38.228
It's worse than that.

06:38.295 --> 06:39.696
It's unauthorized,

06:39.763 --> 06:44.534
and that doesn't fly
in this unit.

06:44.602 --> 06:46.903
Silent as a grave, Skipper.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.805
The beast knows we're after it.

06:48.873 --> 06:50.874
The hunter has become the prey.

06:50.941 --> 06:53.843
Again, Skipper,
the car is not alive.

06:53.911 --> 06:55.178
It can't think or...

06:55.246 --> 06:56.579
Kowalski, don't ruin the moment

06:56.647 --> 06:57.947
with your jibber-jabber.

06:58.015 --> 06:59.949
Besides, if it's not alive,

07:00.017 --> 07:02.285
then how do you explain
its brutal behavior.

07:02.353 --> 07:05.455
Based on available data,
I...Can't.

07:05.523 --> 07:08.324
Yeah, jibber-jabber your way
out of that.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.493
The beast.

07:10.561 --> 07:11.561
Eep.

07:11.629 --> 07:13.496
We move silent,
and we move fast.

07:13.564 --> 07:14.864
Ahh!

07:14.932 --> 07:15.932
Oh!

07:16.000 --> 07:18.868
Ugh.

07:18.936 --> 07:20.169
Ahh!

07:20.237 --> 07:22.171
Distraction scenario: Go.

07:22.239 --> 07:24.440
Yoo-hoo, demon car.

07:24.508 --> 07:26.009
Oh!

07:26.076 --> 07:30.513
You don't have the guts
to take me on.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.248
Though I know
you cannot understand me,

07:32.316 --> 07:33.950
I am talking to you anyway.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.451
Augh!

07:35.519 --> 07:38.922
That thing really
is targeting Rico, isn't it?

07:38.989 --> 07:41.791
It's more demon than car now.

07:44.695 --> 07:45.728
Rico.

07:45.796 --> 07:47.864
Baah! Ahh!

08:00.611 --> 08:03.313
Look, Rico,
we're gonna find that r,

08:03.380 --> 08:04.981
and we're gonna throttle
its engine.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.716
In the meantime,
you can stay here

08:06.784 --> 08:08.718
safe and sound on our island.

08:08.786 --> 08:09.986
Okay.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.921
No, really, Rico,
you're safe here.

08:11.989 --> 08:13.356
Uh-huh.

08:13.424 --> 08:15.091
Seriously, you are.

08:15.159 --> 08:16.993
Yeah.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.861
Okay, listen up, soldier.

08:18.929 --> 08:21.965
I order you to be reassured
by my words.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.767
Now, on my mark, feel safe.

08:24.835 --> 08:26.269
Mark.

08:26.337 --> 08:27.604
All right.

08:27.671 --> 08:28.638
Augh!

08:28.706 --> 08:29.606
Rico.

08:29.673 --> 08:31.174
Augh! Augh! Auuugh!

08:31.241 --> 08:34.409
Rico!

08:34.477 --> 08:35.510
Argh!

08:35.578 --> 08:36.879
Baah!

08:36.947 --> 08:38.648
There's no stopping
that monster.

08:38.716 --> 08:40.515
Men, launch me.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.184
- But, Skipper.
- No "buts."

08:42.251 --> 08:44.454
Listen to the sounds
of that crazy,

08:44.521 --> 08:47.557
frightened penguin
chased by a deranged roadster.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.192
Somebody's got to do something.

08:49.259 --> 08:51.194
Gentlemen, I'm that somebody.

08:51.261 --> 08:54.330
Now, launch me.

08:54.398 --> 08:57.767
Leave me soldier alone.

08:57.835 --> 09:00.703
Ahh! Ow!

09:00.771 --> 09:03.072
Ahhhh.

09:03.140 --> 09:06.075
Ugh! Oof! Mm!

09:07.911 --> 09:09.712
Arrgh.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.414
Rico, what are you doing?

09:11.482 --> 09:13.149
Take cover.

09:13.217 --> 09:16.152
Hide,
or that thing will cream you.

09:18.689 --> 09:21.057
Arrgh.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.060
No, it's nitro-charged!

09:24.128 --> 09:26.729
Augh!

09:26.797 --> 09:28.998
Ah!

09:29.066 --> 09:30.666
Bleh!

09:37.741 --> 09:40.743
That was a brave thing
you did, soldier.

09:40.811 --> 09:43.946
Still, I'm going to miss
that evil, evil car.

09:44.014 --> 09:46.549
I wonder what made it
behave so...Evily.

09:46.617 --> 09:49.385
I guess we'll never know.

09:49.453 --> 09:51.587
Wait just a nanosecond.

09:51.655 --> 09:54.557
This is my duotronic
laser-guided targeting system.

09:54.625 --> 09:55.758
So?

09:55.826 --> 09:58.094
So despite
my remarkable efficiency,

09:58.162 --> 10:00.396
I haven't installed it yet.

10:00.464 --> 10:02.231
Hey, how did that get in there?

10:02.299 --> 10:05.334
I...Um...Vroom-vroom.

10:05.402 --> 10:07.870
Screeeech, ka-blam.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.141
You secretly took the car
out for a spin, smashed it up,

10:12.209 --> 10:13.943
panicked, and hastily slapped
it back together?

10:14.011 --> 10:15.511
Um...Yep.

10:15.579 --> 10:17.714
Well, Rico, in your haste,
you must have grabbed

10:17.781 --> 10:20.083
a few errant parts from some
of my other projects.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.818
There's your culprit.

10:21.885 --> 10:24.620
My targeting system
targeted you.

10:24.688 --> 10:25.955
So no ghost?

10:26.023 --> 10:27.190
No ghost.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.292
Let's hear it for jibber-jabber.

10:29.359 --> 10:30.326
Whoo!

10:34.498 --> 10:36.332
Solid work there, soldier.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.402
It almost makes up for
your clear violation of orders.

10:39.470 --> 10:40.436
Sorry.

10:40.504 --> 10:41.938
Ah, don't sweat it.

10:42.005 --> 10:44.807
The sheer mind-shredding
psychological terror

10:44.875 --> 10:46.509
you endured
is punishment enough.

10:46.577 --> 10:48.911
I mean,
you thought the car was haunted.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.581
Yeah.

10:51.648 --> 10:52.982
Whoo-oo-oo-ooo.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.819
Ooh, sorry, Rico.

10:56.887 --> 10:58.321
Just looking for my sunglasses.
