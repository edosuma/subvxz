Nothing yet.
Still working on it.

26:06.149 --> 26:09.061
But I did trace the source
of Francis Hall's
text message.

26:09.152 --> 26:13.441
It came from a work station
inside Exotrol's
corporate offices.

when we caught Frank

26:27.837 --> 26:29.247
questioning Francis
about the kidnapping?

26:29.338 --> 26:30.589
Did you notice his gun?

26:30.673 --> 26:33.164
What? You mean
the one that was pointed
at the guy's skull? Yeah.

26:33.468 --> 26:34.799
The safety was off.

26:35.511 --> 26:36.796
I don't think Frank
was questioning him,

going to kill him.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.347
Okay. So you're saying

26:41.434 --> 26:45.302
Frank used Francis to
orchestrate the riot
to cover for the kidnapping.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.136
But why?
What's his angle?

26:47.273 --> 26:48.979
Now we know
what to ask him.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.017
lfyou're headed to
Exotrol to find Frank Bolo,
you're headed the wrong way.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.226
He already swiped out
for the day,

26:53.321 --> 26:54.356
I tracked him
back to his house.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.487
I will send you
the address.

In 2010,
the world's banking industry

changed the history books.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.256
Your gang profited big time.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.012
(SIGHS)
That's exactly
what they wanted.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.769
Tank a corporation,
line their pockets,

40:40.856 --> 40:42.141
turn the public
to their cause.

40:42.399 --> 40:44.105
Seems like they’re
changing strategies.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.603
I mean, when they
first showed up,

40:45.694 --> 40:47.184
they did all
the heavy lifting,

40:47.279 --> 40:49.395
now they're
using other people,
like Francis Hall.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.571
So what’ll you do now?

40:51.783 --> 40:52.989
Wait for them to slip up.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.238
Um...

40:57.122 --> 40:59.158
There's something else
I didn't tell you.

41:00.584 --> 41:02.575
My stepbrother Julian.

41:03.337 --> 41:05.043
He was at that riot.

41:06.757 --> 41:08.918
And I didn't want
to tell you because I
wanted to protect him

41:09.009 --> 41:10.795
until I knew
what was going on.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.054
I'm sorry.

41:14.056 --> 41:15.887
Do / need to be
looking at him
more closely?

41:15.974 --> 41:17.214
No,no,no.
I've got it.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.678
Family's important, Alec,

41:20.062 --> 41:22.553
but I need to know anything
that's relevant to myjob.

41:22.689 --> 41:23.724
Do you understand?

41:23.857 --> 41:25.893
I understand.
It won't happen again.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.186
Good.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.070
l have to go.

41:30.364 --> 41:31.854
The things people
will do for money.

41:43.919 --> 41:45.875
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.505
I wanted to let you sleep.

41:50.592 --> 41:51.923
Oh, thanks.

41:54.846 --> 41:55.926
You okay?

41:56.682 --> 41:58.923
Elena and I pulled
riot detail last night.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.257
Ah, how bad?

42:00.519 --> 42:01.599
Bad.

42:01.770 --> 42:03.601
But not in the way
that you're thinking.

42:04.773 --> 42:07.515
The rioters were
stealing food provisions.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.357
And you knew about it?

42:13.448 --> 42:14.824
I'd heard rumors
that Piron was

42:14.908 --> 42:16.239
stockpiling to
drive up prices.

42:16.368 --> 42:18.279
How can the Congress
let them do that?

42:18.620 --> 42:19.860
They have their reasons,
Isuppose.

42:19.955 --> 42:22.446
Oh, and we'rejust
supposed to trust
those reasons?

42:22.582 --> 42:24.288
CPS polices
the citizens.

42:24.418 --> 42:25.533
Who polices
the corporations?

42:25.669 --> 42:26.784
They're supposed to
police themselves.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.330
Apparently they
are not doing it.

42:29.798 --> 42:33.290
You are starting to
sound like one of those
Liber8 terrorists.

42:37.139 --> 42:39.755
CARLOS:
Hey, don't worry,
we'll get them.

42:40.267 --> 42:43.600
Kagame played us this time.
It won't happen again.

42:46.440 --> 42:47.771
See you tomorrow.

43:14.885 --> 43:17.877
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Liber8! Liber8!
