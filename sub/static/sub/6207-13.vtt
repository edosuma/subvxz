WEBVTT

00:03.431 --> 00:05.627
No!

00:08.137 --> 00:10.935
I remember. I'm an angel.
I have a death sentence on my head.

00:11.107 --> 00:12.267
Why?
I disobeyed.

00:12.441 --> 00:13.932
You really shouldn't have come.

00:18.915 --> 00:20.610
- You have to stop it.
- Stop what?

00:23.821 --> 00:24.981
1973?

00:25.757 --> 00:27.588
- Mom?
- John Winchester.

00:31.630 --> 00:35.794
My parents are Mary and John
Winchester and I am your grandson.

00:35.968 --> 00:39.097
Mary gets killed
by a yellow-eyed demon in 1983.

00:39.272 --> 00:43.538
If we don't catch this thing now and
kill it, and it gets away, then Mary dies.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.371
No.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.612
I couldn't stop it. She made the deal.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.347
She died in the nursery, didn't she?

00:56.524 --> 00:58.720
Destiny can't be changed, Dean.

00:58.894 --> 01:02.295
All roads lead to the same destination.

01:08.371 --> 01:09.633
Oh, I take it all back.

01:09.806 --> 01:11.273
I love the devil.

01:26.558 --> 01:28.992
That's what I call peace on Earth.

01:39.538 --> 01:41.166
Anna?

01:42.442 --> 01:44.910
I was just, uh, working on a case.

01:45.245 --> 01:47.236
This is what you dream about?

01:49.416 --> 01:50.543
This is awkward.

01:52.186 --> 01:55.917
Why are you gatecrashing my head?
Why don't you just swing by the motel?

01:56.724 --> 01:57.748
I can't find you.

01:58.527 --> 02:00.085
Oh, Cass did this thing...

02:00.929 --> 02:02.328
Cass. Right.

02:03.131 --> 02:05.122
Now there's a friend
you can count on.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.528
What?

02:07.269 --> 02:08.328
He didn't tell you.

02:09.872 --> 02:12.137
- Tell me what?
- Where I've been.

02:12.342 --> 02:14.401
Of course not, why would he?

02:14.577 --> 02:16.375
Where have you been?

02:16.947 --> 02:18.608
Prison.

02:18.949 --> 02:20.348
Upstairs.

02:20.951 --> 02:23.112
All the torture,
twice the self-righteousness.

02:23.287 --> 02:26.280
- Why wouldn't he have told us?
- He's the one who turned me in.

02:26.458 --> 02:27.823
Don't look so shocked.

02:27.993 --> 02:30.587
He was a good soldier.
Did anything under orders.

02:30.762 --> 02:31.922
I didn't know.

02:32.097 --> 02:33.724
Are you okay?

02:34.901 --> 02:36.061
No.

02:36.235 --> 02:37.259
And I don't have long.

02:38.304 --> 02:41.239
I broke out, barely.
They're looking for me.

02:41.407 --> 02:42.773
- If they find me...
- Okay.

02:43.076 --> 02:44.634
- What do you need?
- Meet me.

02:45.145 --> 02:47.739
225 Industrial.

02:47.915 --> 02:50.281
And please, just hurry.

03:21.719 --> 03:22.947
Hello?

03:23.821 --> 03:24.845
Who's there?

03:32.497 --> 03:34.226
Hello, Anna.

03:36.502 --> 03:37.992
Well...

03:38.571 --> 03:41.131
if I didn't know any better...

03:42.575 --> 03:45.306
I'd say the Winchesters
don't trust me.

03:45.479 --> 03:47.709
They do. I don't.

03:48.382 --> 03:50.213
I wouldn't let them come.

03:50.384 --> 03:53.752
- And why is that?
- You're out of prison, they let you out...

03:53.955 --> 03:56.082
they sent you here
to do their dirty work.

03:56.257 --> 03:57.884
And what makes you so sure?

03:58.059 --> 04:01.654
Because I've experienced
heaven's persuasion.

04:01.830 --> 04:03.594
You mean,
when you gave me to them.

04:05.334 --> 04:06.858
That was a mistake.

04:09.405 --> 04:13.240
- Whatever they sent you here to do...
- They didn't send me.

04:13.744 --> 04:15.678
- I escaped.
- No one escapes.

04:15.846 --> 04:19.577
All these centuries
and you're underestimating me now?

04:20.284 --> 04:22.411
If you're not one of them,
what do you want?

04:22.587 --> 04:23.679
I wanna help.

04:24.188 --> 04:25.348
- You wanna help?
- Yes.

04:25.523 --> 04:27.718
Then what are you doing
with that knife?

04:35.067 --> 04:37.730
- I'm not allowed to defend myself?
- Against whom?

04:37.904 --> 04:39.929
That blade doesn't work
against angels.

04:40.106 --> 04:41.596
It's not like this one.

04:42.642 --> 04:46.579
Maybe you're not working for heaven.
There's something you're not telling me.

04:51.385 --> 04:54.377
Sam Winchester has to die.

05:04.667 --> 05:08.330
I'm sorry. But we have no choice.

05:08.538 --> 05:11.006
- He's Lucifer's vessel.
- He's not the only one.

05:11.174 --> 05:12.232
What, that guy Nick?

05:12.408 --> 05:14.502
He's burning away as we speak.

05:14.678 --> 05:19.047
No.
Sam is the only vessel that matters.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.308
You know what that means.

05:21.486 --> 05:25.081
If Lucifer can't take Sam,
his whole plan short-circuits.

05:25.256 --> 05:31.196
No fight with Michael, no Croatoan virus,
the horsemen go back to their day jobs.

05:31.363 --> 05:33.354
Even if you could...

05:33.766 --> 05:36.428
kill Sam,
Satan would just bring him back to life.

05:36.602 --> 05:39.766
Not after I scatter his cells
across the universe.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.876
They'll never find him, not all of him.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.480
We'll find another way.

05:50.485 --> 05:52.510
How's that going?

05:52.687 --> 05:54.279
How's the Colt working out?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.218
Or the search for God?

05:56.390 --> 05:58.655
Is anything working?

05:58.827 --> 06:03.526
If you want to stop the devil,
this is how.

06:04.733 --> 06:05.962
The answer's still no...

06:08.037 --> 06:10.335
because Sam is my friend.

06:12.308 --> 06:13.798
You've changed.

06:15.312 --> 06:16.711
Maybe too late.

06:17.715 --> 06:19.512
But I have.

06:21.652 --> 06:24.019
Anna, we've been through
much together.

06:24.523 --> 06:27.720
But you come near Sam Winchester
and I'll kill you.

06:47.181 --> 06:48.910
Oh, my God.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.212
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

06:51.386 --> 06:53.251
Hey. You okay?

06:53.421 --> 06:56.015
We have to get her to a hospital.
Come on.

06:56.191 --> 06:57.886
Come on.

07:03.432 --> 07:05.093
Really? Anna?

07:06.569 --> 07:08.561
- I don't believe it.
- It's true.

07:09.039 --> 07:12.031
So she's gone all Glenn Close, huh?
That's awesome.

07:12.209 --> 07:13.608
Who's Glenn Close?

07:13.777 --> 07:16.474
No one. Just this psycho bitch
who likes to boil rabbits.

07:16.681 --> 07:20.412
So the plan to kill me,
would it actually stop Satan?

07:20.570 --> 07:21.628
No. Sam, come on.

07:21.804 --> 07:24.102
Cass, what do you think?
Does Anna have a point?

07:27.578 --> 07:28.602
No.

07:28.779 --> 07:31.077
She's, uh, Glenn Close.

07:32.983 --> 07:36.943
I don't get it. We're looking for the chick
that wants to gank Sam?

07:37.121 --> 07:39.885
- Why poke the bear?
- Anna will keep trying.

07:40.058 --> 07:42.789
She won't give up until Sam is dead.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.591
So we kill her first.

08:07.455 --> 08:09.117
- I found her.
- Where is she?

08:09.291 --> 08:10.815
Not where.

08:11.326 --> 08:13.021
When.

08:13.829 --> 08:14.853
It's 1978.

08:15.797 --> 08:16.855
What?

08:18.468 --> 08:20.095
Why 1978? I wasn't even born yet.

08:21.638 --> 08:23.868
You won't be,
if she kills your parents.

08:24.607 --> 08:26.131
What?

08:26.309 --> 08:28.505
Anna can't get to you because of me.

08:28.679 --> 08:30.943
- So she's going after them.
- Take us back, now.

08:31.115 --> 08:34.049
And deliver you right to Anna?
I should go alone.

08:34.251 --> 08:35.879
They're our parents. We're going.

08:36.054 --> 08:37.544
It's not that easy.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.519
- Why not?
- Time travel is difficult...

08:39.691 --> 08:42.023
even with the powers
of heaven at my disposal.

08:42.193 --> 08:43.352
But you're cut off.

08:43.528 --> 08:45.656
You're like a DeLorean
without plutonium?

08:45.831 --> 08:47.628
I don't understand that reference...

08:48.067 --> 08:51.901
but I'm telling you, taking this trip,
with passengers no less...

08:54.207 --> 08:55.401
it'll weaken me.

08:56.510 --> 08:58.501
They're our mom and dad...

08:59.279 --> 09:01.873
if we can save them
and not just from Anna...

09:02.050 --> 09:04.644
I mean, if we can set things right...

09:04.819 --> 09:06.480
we have to try.

09:13.729 --> 09:15.424
Ready?

09:17.700 --> 09:20.534
- Not really.
- Bend your knees.

09:30.414 --> 09:32.348
Get out of the street!

09:38.390 --> 09:40.187
Did we make it?

09:40.359 --> 09:44.591
Unless they're bringing Pintos back
into production, I, uh, I'd say yes.

09:46.265 --> 09:48.290
- Cass.
- Hey.

09:48.468 --> 09:50.732
Hey. Take it easy,
take it easy. You all right?

09:50.903 --> 09:52.370
I'm fine.

09:52.638 --> 09:54.401
Much better than I expected.

09:56.110 --> 09:57.134
Cass.

09:58.579 --> 10:00.638
He's breathing, sort of.

10:01.148 --> 10:02.547
What do we do?

10:12.862 --> 10:14.887
I mean, the mustaches alone...

10:15.064 --> 10:18.056
So I paid for Cass for five nights up
in the, uh, honeymoon suite.

10:18.234 --> 10:21.226
I told the manager do not disturb.
You know what he said to me?

10:21.404 --> 10:24.067
Yeah. "Don't sweat it.
Wanna buy some dope?"

10:24.408 --> 10:27.775
Dope. We ought to stick around here.
Buy some stock in Microsoft.

10:28.078 --> 10:31.446
Yeah, we might have to
if Cass doesn't recover.

10:32.483 --> 10:34.508
- Is he all right?
- I look like Dr. Angel...

10:34.685 --> 10:36.949
Medicine Woman? He'll wake up.

10:37.121 --> 10:39.249
He's tough,
for a nerdy dude with wings.

10:39.425 --> 10:42.417
If he landed like that, so did Anna.
Should buy us some time.

10:42.594 --> 10:44.789
- So did you find them?
- Yeah, uh.

10:44.963 --> 10:47.431
The Winchesters. 485 Robin Tree.

10:48.001 --> 10:50.265
Let's go pop in on the folks.

11:03.317 --> 11:06.515
- Sam. Sam. Wait, wait, wait.
- Dean, Anna could be here any second.

11:06.688 --> 11:08.155
What are we gonna march up...

11:08.323 --> 11:10.382
- and tell them?
- Uh, the truth.

11:10.559 --> 11:13.960
Their sons are back to save them
from an angel-gone-Terminator?

11:14.129 --> 11:15.688
Those movies haven't come out.

11:15.865 --> 11:18.959
Tell her demons are after them.
She thinks you're a hunter.

11:19.135 --> 11:22.969
Yeah, a hunter who disappeared right
when her dad died. She's gonna love me.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.041
Just follow my lead.

11:32.049 --> 11:33.881
How was work?

11:34.052 --> 11:36.577
It was, uh, great.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.180
Eh. Not until you wash up.

11:40.358 --> 11:41.587
I love when you get bossy.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.227
Ha, ha.

11:52.672 --> 11:54.003
Hi, Mary.

11:54.741 --> 11:55.901
You can't be here.

11:56.076 --> 11:59.774
- I'm sorry if this is a bad time...
- You don't understand. I'm not...

12:01.682 --> 12:03.081
I don't do that anymore.

12:03.251 --> 12:05.344
I have a normal life now.
You have to go.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.716
I'm sorry, but this is important. Okay?

12:10.759 --> 12:13.592
- Sorry, sweetie, they're just...
- Mary's cousins.

12:14.496 --> 12:18.024
We couldn't stop through town
without saying hey, now could we?

12:18.201 --> 12:19.498
Dean.

12:20.403 --> 12:22.598
- You look familiar.
- Really?

12:24.641 --> 12:27.270
Yeah. You do too actually.
Must have met at some time.

12:27.444 --> 12:30.311
- Small towns, right? Gotta love them.
- I'm John.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.744
This is Sam.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.814
Sam. Uh, Mary's father was a Sam.

12:40.025 --> 12:42.118
Well, it's, uh, it's a family name.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.457
You okay, pal?
You look a little spooked.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.267
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.669
- Just a long trip.
- Yeah.

12:55.309 --> 12:58.176
Well, Sam and Dean were just
on their way out.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.006
What? They just got here.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.240
Real happy to meet
folks from Mary's side.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.647
Please, come in for a beer.

13:04.819 --> 13:06.548
Twist my arm.

13:13.195 --> 13:15.425
You sure you're okay, Sam?

13:15.598 --> 13:18.625
Oh, yeah. I'm just, um...

13:20.670 --> 13:22.262
You're so beautiful.

13:23.873 --> 13:26.171
He means that in a non-weird...

13:26.343 --> 13:28.835
- wholesome, family kind of a way.
- Yeah, right.

13:29.013 --> 13:31.140
We haven't seen Mary
in quite some time...

13:32.216 --> 13:35.344
and see,
she's the spitting image of our mom.

13:35.519 --> 13:37.215
- I mean, it's...
- Eerie.

13:38.523 --> 13:40.013
So how are you guys related?

13:41.860 --> 13:42.952
You know, distantly.

13:44.329 --> 13:47.731
- So you knew Mary's parents?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.834
Mary's dad...

13:50.403 --> 13:52.871
was pretty much like a grandpa
to us.

13:53.039 --> 13:54.371
Oh.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.467
It's tragic.

13:56.644 --> 13:57.872
That heart attack.

14:00.314 --> 14:02.180
Yes, it was.

14:04.486 --> 14:06.977
So, uh, what are you guys doing
in town anyway?

14:07.155 --> 14:08.383
Uh, business, you know.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.682
What line of work?

14:09.858 --> 14:11.087
- Plumbing.
- Scrap metal.

14:11.260 --> 14:12.522
Oh, gosh, it's almost 7.

14:12.695 --> 14:15.027
I hate to be rude,
but I gotta get dinner ready.

14:15.197 --> 14:17.665
- Maybe they could stay.
- I'm sure they have to leave.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.762
Uh, look, please stay.
You know, it'd mean a lot to me.

14:22.939 --> 14:26.340
I haven't met much of Mary's side
of the family.

14:31.049 --> 14:33.609
Look, Mr. Woodson,
I'm begging you to reconsider.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.412
<i>I'd like to, John.</i>

14:35.586 --> 14:38.351
<i>You're a great mechanic
but times ain't exactly rosy.</i>

14:38.524 --> 14:39.718
Even just part-time.

14:39.892 --> 14:41.223
I really need this job.

14:41.393 --> 14:43.520
All right.
Look, come on in right now...

14:43.696 --> 14:46.632
let's talk,
maybe we can figure something out.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.858
<i>You serious?</i>

14:48.034 --> 14:49.729
I'll see you in 10 minutes.

14:49.903 --> 14:51.461
Don't keep me waiting.

14:51.671 --> 14:52.899
You have to leave, now.

14:53.073 --> 14:54.802
- Okay. Just listen...
- No, you listen.

14:54.974 --> 14:57.671
Last time I saw you,
a demon killed my parents.

14:58.212 --> 15:00.578
Now you waltz in here
like you're family?

15:00.881 --> 15:04.079
Whatever you want, no.
Leave me alone.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.817
You and John are in danger.

15:06.388 --> 15:09.084
- What are you talking about?
- Something's coming for you.

15:10.092 --> 15:12.583
- Demon?
- Not exactly.

15:13.296 --> 15:15.628
- What, then?
- It's kind of hard to explain, okay?

15:15.798 --> 15:17.231
An angel.

15:18.267 --> 15:20.258
What?

15:20.436 --> 15:22.496
- There's no such thing.
- I wish...

15:22.706 --> 15:25.766
but they're twice as strong as demons
and bigger dicks.

15:25.943 --> 15:27.808
Why would an angel wanna kill us?

15:27.978 --> 15:31.346
Long story, we'll tell you,
but right now, you've gotta trust us...

15:31.516 --> 15:33.074
and we gotta go.

15:33.518 --> 15:35.850
Look at my face
and tell me if I'm lying to you.

15:38.523 --> 15:40.287
Okay.

15:40.626 --> 15:42.958
- Where do we go?
- Out of here. We gotta move now.

15:43.129 --> 15:44.596
Okay, but what do I tell John?

15:44.764 --> 15:46.755
Just tell him...

15:48.468 --> 15:49.799
John?

16:10.325 --> 16:12.350
Mr. Woodson?

16:13.362 --> 16:15.331
You still here?

16:59.914 --> 17:03.577
- I wish I could say it's good to see you.
- You too, Dean.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.550
I'm sorry.

18:13.529 --> 18:16.521
Sorry, it's not that easy
to kill an angel.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.825
No, but you can distract them.

18:44.096 --> 18:45.359
Monsters.

18:45.765 --> 18:48.393
- Monsters?
- Yes.

18:48.568 --> 18:50.001
Monsters are real.

18:50.170 --> 18:53.607
- I'm sorry, I didn't know how to...
- And you fight them? All of you?

18:53.975 --> 18:55.340
Yeah.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.736
How long?

19:00.881 --> 19:02.349
All my life.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.453
- Understand...
- She didn't have a choice...

19:06.621 --> 19:08.054
Shut up. All of you.

19:08.390 --> 19:12.054
Look, not another word or so help me,
I will turn this car around.

19:17.633 --> 19:21.035
Wow, awkward family road trip.

19:21.205 --> 19:22.570
No kidding.

19:32.017 --> 19:34.884
Place has been in the family for years.

19:37.288 --> 19:38.722
Devil's trap.

19:38.891 --> 19:40.654
Pure iron fixtures, of course.

19:42.094 --> 19:45.291
There should be salt and holy water
in the pantry. Knives, guns.

19:45.464 --> 19:50.027
- All that stuff will do is piss it off.
- What'll kill it? Or slow it down, at least?

19:51.605 --> 19:54.073
- Not much.
- Ha. Great.

19:54.474 --> 19:56.272
Well, he said not much, not nothing.

19:56.844 --> 19:58.744
We packed.

20:01.549 --> 20:03.608
We put this up...

20:04.686 --> 20:06.654
if she comes close...

20:06.822 --> 20:09.450
we beam her right off the starship.

20:11.126 --> 20:16.121
This is holy oil.
It's kind of like a devil's trap for angels.

20:16.433 --> 20:18.924
Come on. I'll show you how it works.

20:28.279 --> 20:31.113
Hey, what's the deal with the thing
on the paper?

20:31.283 --> 20:33.649
It's a sigil. That means...

20:33.819 --> 20:36.481
I don't care what it means,
where's it go?

20:38.123 --> 20:40.217
On a wall or a door.

20:40.393 --> 20:41.985
How big should I make it?

20:43.863 --> 20:45.626
- John...
- What?

20:46.532 --> 20:49.627
You all might have treated me like a fool,
but I am not useless.

20:49.803 --> 20:53.637
I can draw a damn... Whatever it is.

20:53.807 --> 20:55.502
A sigil.

20:55.976 --> 20:58.172
Why don't you go help Sam out?

20:58.346 --> 21:01.179
Okay?
Because this has gotta be done in...

21:01.983 --> 21:03.678
It's gotta be done in human blood.

21:16.633 --> 21:18.430
So how big?

21:21.338 --> 21:23.033
I'll show you.

21:25.943 --> 21:27.410
What?

21:30.548 --> 21:34.542
All of a sudden,
you really remind me of my dad.

21:50.804 --> 21:52.567
That's really good.

21:54.441 --> 21:56.568
You come to check on me?

21:57.244 --> 21:58.906
Uh...

21:59.714 --> 22:02.274
I wanted to say
I'm sorry about all this.

22:02.450 --> 22:03.474
I know it's a lot.

22:03.985 --> 22:08.616
Look, how long have you known
about this hunting stuff?

22:10.193 --> 22:12.252
Pretty much forever.

22:12.628 --> 22:13.788
My dad raised me in it.

22:14.463 --> 22:15.589
You're serious?

22:16.767 --> 22:19.065
Well, who the hell does that to a kid?

22:20.470 --> 22:22.631
You know, for the record,
Mary's parents did.

22:22.806 --> 22:23.830
I don't care.

22:24.007 --> 22:28.342
You know, what kind of irresponsible
bastard lets a child anywhere near...?

22:28.513 --> 22:30.310
You know, you could have been killed.

22:30.481 --> 22:33.609
I, uh, came kind of close.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.480
The number it must have done
on your head.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.651
Your father was supposed
to protect you.

22:42.494 --> 22:44.463
He was trying.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.591
He died trying.

22:52.006 --> 22:53.735
Believe me.

22:57.612 --> 23:00.673
I used to be mad at him.
I mean, I used to...

23:02.017 --> 23:03.314
I used to hate the guy.

23:03.485 --> 23:05.976
But now I...

23:06.455 --> 23:09.117
I get it. He was...

23:09.759 --> 23:12.023
He was doing the best he could...

23:12.362 --> 23:16.856
and he was trying to keep it together
in... In this impossible situation.

23:19.803 --> 23:21.532
See...

23:22.339 --> 23:24.170
my mom, um...

23:26.010 --> 23:29.276
she was amazing, beautiful...

23:29.881 --> 23:32.475
and she was the love of his life...

23:33.418 --> 23:35.215
and she got killed...

23:35.788 --> 23:40.657
and I think he would have gone crazy
if he didn't do something.

23:45.198 --> 23:47.029
Truth is, um...

23:47.301 --> 23:49.235
my dad died...

23:49.403 --> 23:51.735
before I got to tell him...

23:54.542 --> 23:56.510
that I understand...

23:58.246 --> 23:59.577
why he did what he did...

24:00.581 --> 24:05.246
and I forgive him
for what it did to us. I do.

24:05.421 --> 24:07.446
And I just...

24:11.194 --> 24:12.456
I love him.

24:27.345 --> 24:29.211
Uriel.

24:31.883 --> 24:33.783
- You look well.
- Shouldn't have called.

24:33.952 --> 24:38.947
We're under strict orders
not to come down here...

24:39.125 --> 24:40.649
much less take a vessel.

24:45.231 --> 24:46.563
You're not the Anna of now.

24:46.734 --> 24:49.635
No, but 30 years from now,
I'm still your superior.

24:52.072 --> 24:53.937
I need you to kill some humans.

24:54.308 --> 24:56.436
Always happy to do some smiting.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.336
But what's going on?

24:58.513 --> 25:01.676
In the future, these people are going
to kill you, Uriel.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.653
I'm giving you the chance
to kill them first.

25:07.957 --> 25:09.447
Thank you.

25:15.499 --> 25:17.091
Okay.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.895
You said you'd explain everything
when we had a minute.

25:20.303 --> 25:22.295
We have a minute.

25:22.473 --> 25:24.907
Why does an angel want me dead?

25:28.312 --> 25:29.802
Because they're dicks.

25:30.716 --> 25:32.650
Not good enough.

25:33.018 --> 25:35.646
I didn't even know they existed
and now I'm a target?

25:37.322 --> 25:38.346
It's complicated.

25:38.957 --> 25:40.516
Fine.

25:42.429 --> 25:43.691
All ears.

25:48.169 --> 25:51.502
- You're just gonna have to trust me.
- I've been trusting you all day.

25:53.674 --> 25:56.974
- It's kind of hard to believe.
- All right, I'm walking out the door.

25:57.145 --> 25:58.737
I'm your son.

26:01.016 --> 26:02.040
What?

26:07.957 --> 26:09.549
I'm your son.

26:10.393 --> 26:12.725
I'm sorry.
I don't know how else to say it.

26:13.563 --> 26:15.725
We're from the year 2010.

26:16.533 --> 26:19.161
An angel zapped us back here.

26:19.903 --> 26:22.394
Not the one that attacked you,
friendlier.

26:23.708 --> 26:26.404
You can't expect me to believe that.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.580
Our names are
Dean and Sam Winchester.

26:34.286 --> 26:36.584
We're named after your parents.

26:38.524 --> 26:40.583
When I would get sick...

26:41.127 --> 26:43.527
you would make me
tomato rice soup...

26:44.498 --> 26:46.864
because that's what your mom
made you.

26:47.534 --> 26:50.402
And instead of a lullaby...

26:51.305 --> 26:53.705
you would sing "Hey Jude."

26:54.308 --> 26:56.799
That's your favorite Beatles song.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.408
I...

27:00.816 --> 27:03.114
I don't believe it.

27:03.785 --> 27:04.809
No.

27:05.387 --> 27:07.446
I'm sorry, but it's true.

27:09.459 --> 27:12.587
I raised my kids to be hunters?

27:13.830 --> 27:15.229
No, no. You didn't.

27:15.565 --> 27:18.899
- How could I do that to you?
- You didn't do it...

27:21.105 --> 27:23.073
because you're dead.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.342
What...?

27:28.547 --> 27:29.639
What happened?

27:31.583 --> 27:33.141
Yellow-eyed demon.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.581
He killed you...

27:39.926 --> 27:42.486
and John became a hunter
to get revenge.

27:44.565 --> 27:46.430
He raised us in this life.

27:50.003 --> 27:51.436
Listen to me.

27:53.608 --> 27:57.977
A demon comes into Sam's nursery,
exactly six months after he's born.

27:58.313 --> 27:59.974
November 2nd, 1983.

28:00.148 --> 28:03.607
Remember that date
and whatever you do...

28:04.687 --> 28:06.211
do not go in there.

28:06.388 --> 28:08.549
You wake up and you take Sam,
and you run.

28:08.724 --> 28:10.659
That's not good enough, Dean.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.958
Wherever she goes,
the demon's gonna find her.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.796
Find me.

28:18.970 --> 28:20.528
Well, then what?

28:24.041 --> 28:25.599
She can leave Dad, that's what.

28:30.616 --> 28:31.640
You gotta leave John.

28:32.150 --> 28:34.084
- What?
- When this is all over...

28:34.252 --> 28:36.551
walk away and never look back.

28:38.157 --> 28:40.148
So we're never born.

28:40.426 --> 28:42.894
- He's right.
- I can't.

28:44.530 --> 28:47.500
You're saying that you're my children
and now you're saying...

28:47.668 --> 28:48.999
You have no other choice.

28:49.169 --> 28:51.899
There's a difference between dying
and never being born.

28:52.072 --> 28:54.439
Trust me, we're okay with it,
I promise you that.

28:54.643 --> 28:55.871
Okay, well, I'm not.

28:56.044 --> 28:59.775
Listen, you think you can have
that normal life that you want so bad...

29:00.215 --> 29:01.341
but you can't.

29:01.516 --> 29:03.041
I'm sorry.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.584
It's all gonna go rotten.

29:05.287 --> 29:07.585
You are gonna die...

29:07.757 --> 29:10.726
and your children will be cursed.

29:18.368 --> 29:21.236
- There has to be a way.
- No. This is the way.

29:21.406 --> 29:23.169
- Leave John.
- I can't.

29:23.975 --> 29:26.876
This is bigger than us.

29:27.045 --> 29:29.207
There are so many more lives
at stake here.

29:29.381 --> 29:31.713
You don't understand. I can't.

29:35.054 --> 29:36.385
It's too late.

29:38.425 --> 29:40.188
I'm...

29:42.095 --> 29:44.325
I'm pregnant.

29:47.768 --> 29:49.326
Hey, we got a problem.

29:49.503 --> 29:51.698
Those blood things, the sigils,
they're gone.

29:51.972 --> 29:54.133
- Gone as in...?
- I drew one on the door.

29:54.308 --> 29:57.801
I turned around and when I looked
back again, it was a smudge.

30:02.918 --> 30:05.979
- He's right.
- There's no more holy oil.

30:41.194 --> 30:44.129
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Uriel.

30:45.132 --> 30:47.293
- Oh, come on.
- Go.

30:53.541 --> 30:55.475
Here goes nothing.

31:20.204 --> 31:21.933
John!

31:38.324 --> 31:40.019
- Sammy!
- Ugh.

31:53.775 --> 31:55.902
Sam!

32:05.721 --> 32:08.054
I'm really sorry.

32:09.226 --> 32:11.057
Anna.

32:15.432 --> 32:17.128
Michael.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.962
Michael?

32:46.400 --> 32:47.628
I didn't know.

32:48.402 --> 32:49.960
Goodbye, Uriel.

32:54.509 --> 32:57.103
- What did you do to John?
- John is fine.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.611
Who...? What are you?

32:59.781 --> 33:01.272
Shh. Shh.

33:12.796 --> 33:16.391
Well, I'd say this conversation
is long overdue, wouldn't you?

33:16.566 --> 33:19.434
- Fix him.
- First...

33:20.038 --> 33:21.938
we talk.

33:22.640 --> 33:26.041
Then I fix your darling little Sammy.

33:27.813 --> 33:29.303
How'd you get in my dad anyway?

33:29.882 --> 33:33.374
I told him I could save his wife
and he said yes.

33:35.020 --> 33:38.821
I guess they oversold me
being your one and only vessel.

33:39.759 --> 33:42.557
You're my true vessel,
but not my only one.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.324
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It's a bloodline.

33:45.566 --> 33:46.590
"A bloodline?"

33:46.767 --> 33:48.701
Stretching back to Cain and Abel.

33:48.869 --> 33:50.928
It's in your blood, your father's blood.

33:51.105 --> 33:52.697
Your family's blood.

33:53.608 --> 33:55.235
Awesome.

33:56.211 --> 33:58.907
Six degrees of Heaven Bacon.

33:59.081 --> 34:00.708
What do you want with me?

34:00.882 --> 34:02.680
You don't know the answer to that?

34:02.852 --> 34:05.912
Well, you know I ain't gonna say yes,
so why are you here?

34:06.089 --> 34:09.616
- What do you want with me?
- I just want you to understand...

34:09.792 --> 34:12.489
what you and I have to do.

34:12.763 --> 34:13.786
Oh, I get it.

34:14.498 --> 34:16.261
You got beef with your brother.

34:16.433 --> 34:19.425
Well, get some therapy, pal.
Don't take it out on my planet.

34:21.139 --> 34:22.197
You're wrong.

34:24.074 --> 34:28.034
No, Lucifer defied our father,
and he betrayed me...

34:28.213 --> 34:32.913
but still, I don't want this any more
than you would wanna kill Sam.

34:38.425 --> 34:40.723
You know, my brother...

34:40.893 --> 34:42.327
I practically raised him.

34:43.130 --> 34:46.998
I took care of him in a way
most people could never understand...

34:47.168 --> 34:49.101
and I still love him.

34:53.041 --> 34:56.842
But I'm going to kill him
because it is right and I have to.

34:57.045 --> 34:58.911
- Oh, because God says so?
- Yes.

34:59.848 --> 35:04.183
From the beginning, he knew this was
how it was going to end.

35:05.188 --> 35:07.247
And you're just gonna do
whatever God says?

35:07.424 --> 35:09.449
Yes, because I'm a good son.

35:11.795 --> 35:15.926
Trust me, pal, take it from someone
who knows, that is a dead-end street.

35:16.100 --> 35:19.831
And you think you know better
than my father?

35:20.071 --> 35:23.769
One unimportant little man. What makes
you think you get to choose?

35:23.942 --> 35:26.308
Because I gotta believe...

35:26.511 --> 35:29.105
that I can choose what I do...

35:29.681 --> 35:32.310
with my unimportant little life.

35:34.020 --> 35:35.817
You're wrong.

35:36.222 --> 35:37.484
You know how I know?

35:43.197 --> 35:49.296
Think of a million random acts
of chance...

35:49.471 --> 35:53.134
that let John and Mary be born,
to meet...

35:53.308 --> 35:56.004
to fall in love,
to have the two of you.

35:57.011 --> 35:59.845
Think of the million random choices
that you make...

36:00.015 --> 36:04.008
and yet how each and every one of
them brings you closer to your destiny.

36:07.657 --> 36:10.023
Do you know why that is?

36:11.862 --> 36:15.321
Because it's not random,
it's not chance.

36:15.666 --> 36:20.501
It's a plan that is playing itself
out perfectly.

36:22.773 --> 36:24.901
Free will's an illusion, Dean.

36:26.879 --> 36:29.677
That's why you're going to say yes.

36:31.517 --> 36:32.746
Oh, buck up.

36:33.186 --> 36:35.620
It could be worse.
You know, unlike my brothers...

36:35.788 --> 36:39.224
I won't leave you a drooling mess
when I'm done wearing you.

36:39.392 --> 36:41.520
- But what about my dad?
- Better than new.

36:41.695 --> 36:45.722
In fact, I'm gonna do your mom
and your dad a favor.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.568
- What?
- Scrub their minds.

36:48.736 --> 36:51.900
They won't remember me or you.

36:52.407 --> 36:55.934
- You can't do that.
- I'm giving your mother what she wants.

36:56.111 --> 36:58.306
She can go back to her husband,
her family.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.449
She's gonna walk
right into that nursery.

37:00.616 --> 37:02.607
Obviously.

37:03.786 --> 37:10.192
And you always knew that was going
to play out one way or another.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.430
You can't fight city hall.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.084
He's home.

37:36.122 --> 37:38.283
Safe and sound.

37:39.826 --> 37:41.794
Your turn.

37:43.965 --> 37:45.523
I'll see you soon, Dean.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.252
Castiel? Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:06.422 --> 38:07.616
- Cass.
- Got you.

38:07.790 --> 38:10.191
You son of a bitch. You made it.

38:10.828 --> 38:12.728
I did?

38:13.464 --> 38:16.058
I'm very surprised.

38:16.967 --> 38:19.698
Whoa, you're okay. Bed. Yeah.

38:27.246 --> 38:29.476
- Well, I could use that drink now.
- Yeah.

38:29.915 --> 38:31.507
Well...

38:33.653 --> 38:35.120
this is it.

38:35.288 --> 38:36.620
This is what?

38:37.124 --> 38:40.321
Team Free Will, one ex-blood junkie...

38:41.128 --> 38:44.495
one dropout with 6 bucks to his name
and Mr. Comatose over there.

38:44.665 --> 38:46.827
- That's awesome.
- It's not funny.

38:47.835 --> 38:49.496
I'm not laughing.

38:55.377 --> 38:58.938
- They all say we'll say yes.
- I know. It's getting annoying.

38:59.114 --> 39:00.308
What if they're right?

39:01.016 --> 39:02.108
They're not.

39:02.952 --> 39:05.648
I mean, why would we, either of us...

39:08.291 --> 39:10.452
- but I've been weak before.
- Sam.

39:10.627 --> 39:13.722
- Michael got Dad to say yes.
- That was different.

39:13.898 --> 39:15.661
Anna was about to kill Mom.

39:15.833 --> 39:17.892
And if you could save Mom...

39:18.169 --> 39:19.568
what would you say?

39:24.643 --> 39:27.510
- Where did you even get it?
- Garage sale.

39:27.679 --> 39:29.341
Twenty-five cents.

39:29.515 --> 39:31.540
Well, I'm glad to hear that anyway.

39:31.718 --> 39:33.549
Hey.

39:33.720 --> 39:37.417
I mean, you really don't think
it's just a little cheesy?

39:37.590 --> 39:39.149
Mm-mm.

39:39.326 --> 39:41.692
I think it's sweet.

39:43.997 --> 39:46.592
Can't even put my finger
on why I like it.

39:47.936 --> 39:51.201
I just like it.

39:53.208 --> 39:55.404
Well, then I love it.

40:02.251 --> 40:04.116
Ooh.

40:06.056 --> 40:08.251
Quite a kick there.

40:08.425 --> 40:10.950
Troublemaker already.

40:12.529 --> 40:13.758
It's okay, baby.

40:13.931 --> 40:16.092
It's all okay.

40:17.402 --> 40:20.530
Angels are watching over you.
