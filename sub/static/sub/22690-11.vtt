02:18.012 --> 02:21.266
If Castle were standing here right now,
what would you say to him?

Mr. Russo, I'm going to share
several crime scene photos with you.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.892
Look at them carefully.
Tell me if anything looks familiar.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.894
Aren't you gonna Mirandize me,
Agent Madani?

10:44.977 --> 10:48.690
No need. Unless I decide to arrest you.
We're just talking.

'Cause you're a murderer
who's gonna pay for the lives you took.

was you.

I was there to take you home.

to your place...

holding you all night

11:18.219 --> 11:21.806
in the same bed that you and I
had repeated sexual encounters.

11:21.889 --> 11:26.518
Did you and Frank Castle conduct
illegal covert operations in Kandahar?

11:26.602 --> 11:28.730
Well, I'm sure you've perused
my service record.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.898
Does it indicate that I was in Kandahar?

11:31.399 --> 11:32.639
Here's what I think's happened.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.654
You're pissed Frank Castle got away,
and you're looking to blame me,

11:36.738 --> 11:39.615
so you sent your guys
to come down to pick me up.

11:39.698 --> 11:43.870
But now... now you're realizing
that maybe that wasn't such a smart move.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.624
Now, if this was official,
you wouldn't be sitting there alone.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.592
You wanna tell me
that this room isn't bugged?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.220
You can never be too careful.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.432
I've got an offer for you. Best and final.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.561
I'll guarantee leniency if you give me
the executions, the tortures, everything.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.980
And when I say everything,
I need William Rawlins.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.111
You didn't know I had Rawlins' name.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.656
You killed Sam Stein.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.367
And when I can prove that,

12:23.450 --> 12:26.537
your life won't be worth

12:26.620 --> 12:28.580

12:30.833 --> 12:32.001
I know...

12:33.669 --> 12:38.424
that you must be haunted by the death...

12:38.507 --> 12:42.719
Sorry, forgive me,
deaths of your partners...

12:44.931 --> 12:47.433

the guy that you're looking for.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.017
You're right.

I'm looking for Frank Castle.

12:52.438 --> 12:56.025

Maybe I'll take my time finding him.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.112
God, you remember
how he looked at you in that stairwell?

13:00.612 --> 13:05.492
He's gonna kill you,
and he's gonna enjoy doing it.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.371
Who knows? Maybe he was tipped off.

13:09.455 --> 13:13.500
Maybe he's waiting
right outside this building.

You just couldn't.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.234
I mean, if you've only ever had singles,

13:38.317 --> 13:41.403
you couldn't possibly understand.

in Manhattan.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.376
Great school.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.379
Yeah, it's a great school, sure.
Not a cheap school.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.549

A bit of influence peddling?

14:02.633 --> 14:03.634
No, no.

14:04.676 --> 14:07.221
They're either good enough to get in,
or they're not.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.723
No, I'm meeting with
the police commissioner about his son.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.351
Turns out the little shit's
quite the hacker.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.645
- Hmm.
- Got himself into some serious trouble.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.288
We're gonna clear the slate
on condition he comes to work for us.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.357
Ah.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.985
So, that's what I'm doing here.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.780
The question is, Bill,
as nice as this is...

14:25.865 --> 14:27.449
what the hell are you doing here?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.786
And why are we talking in the cold
where no one can hear us?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.874
You've heard the news about Frank Castle?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.918
Sure, it's hard to miss.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.627
He's a problem for us.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.045
"Us"?

14:41.422 --> 14:45.259
He has information that could be injurious
to the agency if it ever came out.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.845
The medal you gave me,
all the intel I brought in,

14:48.930 --> 14:52.724
much of it was gained via...
let's call them unorthodox methods.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.518
Illegally gained?

14:54.601 --> 14:57.188
I did what was required
to protect the country.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.981
Castle was a part of it.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.858
I thought he was dead, now he's not.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.610
He tried to kill me.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.946
- Why?
- Because I tried to kill him.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.993
I will not let him undermine the agency
or undo what I've achieved.

15:14.746 --> 15:17.499
Do you know
I used to suffer from panic attacks?

15:17.583 --> 15:18.852
Out of the blue, couldn't breathe.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.712
Heart pounding in my chest
like I was having a coronary.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.840
Two years of it.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.759
It took two years for me to realize

15:27.843 --> 15:33.515
that I only feel right when I'm honest
with myself about my actions.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.851
Straight, no self-justification.

15:36.768 --> 15:38.062
You should try that.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.482
I made a call.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.236
We can either clean this up
or let Castle take us down.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.863
No, I do not understand the "us,"
the "we" rhetoric.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.867
Are you suggesting I am culpable
for the shitstorm you started over there?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.244
I'm your guy now.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.789
No way this shit hits me
and doesn't splatter on your shoes.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.292
You may not be political,
but everyone else is.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.044
God damn you, Bill. God damn you.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.547
I asked you... I asked you
if there was anything I needed to know.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.385
I have a civilian asset ready and waiting
to take Castle out.

16:10.177 --> 16:14.348
All I need is access to our electronic
surveillance apparatus in New York

16:14.431 --> 16:16.433
to let my asset find him first.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.729
It's been done before.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.148
You're asking me to sanction
a man's murder.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.111
A psychopathic terrorist
wanted for multiple crimes.

16:27.944 --> 16:30.990
Think of it as decommissioning
unwanted ordnance.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.911
[Orange] That's all Castle is,
a weapon we no longer have any use for.

16:36.578 --> 16:39.999
The alternative
does not bear thinking about.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.084
[dramatic music playing]

16:48.757 --> 16:50.384
[Billy] Here's what I think's happened.

16:50.467 --> 16:54.179
You're pissed Frank Castle got away,
and you're looking to blame me...

16:54.263 --> 16:55.264
Turn it off.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.308
...so you sent your guys to come down...

16:57.391 --> 17:00.686
I agree with him. You got angry
and made a dumb move, Dinah.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.439
You helped him build
a conflict-of-interest case against you.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.442
- I needed to rattle his cage.
- To what end?

17:07.608 --> 17:10.445
- I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
- All right!

17:10.529 --> 17:14.157
I let Russo get close to me.
I trusted him.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.826
So, yeah. Yeah, maybe...

17:16.327 --> 17:18.912
maybe I wanted to look him in the eye
and tell him for myself

17:18.994 --> 17:21.248
that Homeland won't rest
until we take him in.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.959
- You let it get personal.
- Yeah, you're damn right I did.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.627
You want me to apologize for that?

17:25.711 --> 17:29.006
Will we let this stand? Will you, Rafi?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.508
Billy Russo killed Sam.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.679
He pretty much admitted it to me
right after he tried to kill Castle.

17:36.763 --> 17:38.515
Do you know where Castle is?

17:39.433 --> 17:40.601
Or this Micro guy?

17:41.977 --> 17:43.354
- No.
- Find them.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.775
Time to rattle some cages of my own.

17:50.778 --> 17:51.778
[door shuts]

17:53.072 --> 17:56.283
- How much more? I'm getting carpal tunnel.
- [cell phone ringing]

17:56.908 --> 17:59.035
- [Sarah] Really? [chuckles]
- [Leo] Hold on.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.621
Can I go up, too?

18:00.704 --> 18:02.164
- Keep chopping.
- [groans]

18:02.248 --> 18:04.166
Come on. Almost done.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.710
- [knock on door]
- I'll get it.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.634
Who is it, baby?

18:13.717 --> 18:18.514
- [man] Hey, son, is your mom in?
- [Zach] Uh... yeah, sure.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.083
- Can I help you?
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.707
Yeah, we received a call from this address
to the Castle tip line.

18:30.734 --> 18:31.735
Did you call?

18:33.153 --> 18:36.824
Uh, no. No, I didn't call.
Uh, it must be some sort of mistake.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.242
[chuckles]

18:39.034 --> 18:40.744
Got something you want to tell me, son?

18:41.245 --> 18:42.454
- Um...
- [Sarah] Hey.

18:43.038 --> 18:46.792
No, he's only 11 years old.
You don't have the right to question him.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.193
Think I could speak to your husband?

18:51.963 --> 18:55.967
Um, no. You know what? My, uh...
my husband passed away a year ago.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.929
My condolences.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.966
How do you know Frank Castle?

19:08.439 --> 19:09.440
I don't.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.613
Where's your daughter?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.620
Is she home or not?

19:26.498 --> 19:29.501
No, uh, my daughter
is spending the night at a friend's.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.922
Well, look, thing is,
I think it's best you come with me.

19:34.005 --> 19:35.466
For your own protection.

19:35.549 --> 19:38.594
[stammers] I really appreciate the offer,
but I'm sure we'll be fine.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.974
You're both coming with me.

19:45.809 --> 19:46.810
Zach, run!

19:48.312 --> 19:50.939
- [Sarah yelling]
- [man grunting]

19:53.234 --> 19:55.444
[screaming]

19:55.527 --> 19:56.570
[man grunts]

19:58.989 --> 20:00.782
- Hey!
- Get out!

20:01.450 --> 20:04.160
Get away from my family,
or I swear to God I'll use this!

20:04.245 --> 20:06.037
- [man 2] Drop it!
- [Zach] Mom...

20:06.121 --> 20:08.123
[gasping breaths] I'm sorry.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.458
- Do it!
- [gasps]

20:17.132 --> 20:19.009
[Micro] Oh, yeah, that's very subtle.

20:19.968 --> 20:23.305
- They'll never see you coming.
- Yeah, well, I want 'em to see me.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.769
Well, that makes sense. [scoffs]

20:31.897 --> 20:35.734
But you know what that is, right?
That's your death, that's not theirs.

20:36.318 --> 20:40.322
You do this like this, you're...
you're as good as dead already.

20:41.197 --> 20:42.241
It's who I am.

20:43.199 --> 20:44.493
Who I've always been.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.454
[Micro] Seriously?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.835
You would rather be dead than feeling?

20:55.754 --> 20:57.881
Frank Castle the Punisher
on a suicide mission

20:57.964 --> 21:01.260
because, what, he doesn't like it when,
uh, he gets his feelings hurt?

21:01.343 --> 21:04.888
Damn... I am not gonna miss
the sound of your voice.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.849
What are you doing?

21:08.517 --> 21:09.685
That skull?

21:10.477 --> 21:12.104
That's a memento mori.

21:13.104 --> 21:15.524
It's Latin for, "Remember, you will die."

21:16.191 --> 21:19.152
In Rome, victorious generals
would return from war,

21:19.236 --> 21:22.173
and so they didn't get blinded by glory,
they'd have a slave who would say,

21:22.197 --> 21:24.366
"Remember, you're only human.
You are gonna die."

21:24.450 --> 21:25.784
Well, that sounds good to me.

21:25.867 --> 21:29.162
Well, it's meant as an admonition
to value your life, to live it well.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.915
Move, David.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.000
Yeah, all right.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.713
- You do what you gotta do.
- That's right.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.175
Just one more thing. What about them?

21:42.801 --> 21:44.636
What about Zach and Leo?

21:45.762 --> 21:46.847
And Sarah?

21:47.348 --> 21:49.433
When we first started this,
it wasn't about the dead,

21:49.516 --> 21:50.851
it was about the living.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.229
Wait a second.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.816
What happened here? Look at that.

21:58.942 --> 22:00.110
Right there.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.654
Go back.

22:05.782 --> 22:06.783
There.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.161
[Sarah screaming]

22:10.245 --> 22:11.538
Oh, my God.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.166
[Sarah] Get away from my family,
or I swear to God I'll use this!

22:15.250 --> 22:19.170
- [man 2] Drop it!
- [Zach gasping] Mom... I'm sorry.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.547
- [man] Do it!
- When was that?

22:20.631 --> 22:21.798
- Um...
- How long ago?

22:21.882 --> 22:25.010
Come on, pull yourself together
and do your job. When was it?

22:25.093 --> 22:27.888
Uh... a little less than an hour ago.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.432
- I'm outta here.
- David, stop.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.892
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop!

22:31.975 --> 22:33.394
- [Micro] What?
- Just come on.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.478
Think!

22:37.856 --> 22:39.650
- They're coming.
- Who?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.818
Rawlins, Russo, they're coming here.
They...

22:43.069 --> 22:44.154
Sarah has my number.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.115
They know who Pete Castiglione is.

22:47.198 --> 22:48.534
She wouldn't do that.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.577
Whole goddamn world's
calling me a terrorist.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.287
She doesn't owe me a goddamn thing.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.250
You gotta assume
they already have a lock on it.

22:54.748 --> 22:55.748
Leo.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.458
Leo?

22:58.293 --> 22:59.335
Where's Leo?

22:59.920 --> 23:02.005
- What do you mean?
- They didn't take her!

23:02.881 --> 23:04.132
[typing]

23:06.092 --> 23:08.219
[Frank] Attagirl. Attagirl.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.597
Okay, does she have a phone?

23:11.848 --> 23:13.850
- Yeah.
- Okay. Call her.

23:15.393 --> 23:16.394
Go on.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.481
Go on.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.861
Uh... How can I?

23:32.578 --> 23:34.037
[Leo shivering]

23:42.838 --> 23:44.548
[cell phone ringing]

23:49.344 --> 23:50.345
[Frank] Leo?

23:52.263 --> 23:53.682
- Leo?
- Pete?

23:53.765 --> 23:55.016
Sweetheart, I'm gonna help you.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.268
But you can't talk to anybody.
Not the police, no one.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.770
You have to promise me that.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.023
They took Mom and Zach.
I don't know what to do.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.944
Yeah, I know what they did.
I know you have no reason to trust me,

24:06.027 --> 24:08.196
but I'm the only hope
you and your family have.

24:09.490 --> 24:10.616
Okay.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.618
Listen, when we get off the phone,

24:12.701 --> 24:14.703
I want you to take the battery out.
You just...

24:14.786 --> 24:17.456
Throw it as far as you can.
Do you know what a SIM card is?

24:17.539 --> 24:19.207
- Yeah.
- Good.

24:19.290 --> 24:22.085
You throw that in the other direction.
All right?

24:22.168 --> 24:25.463
There's a park, uh, a playground
by a pool that we used to...

24:25.547 --> 24:27.307
- We'd call it the "pool playground."
- Okay.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.443
Took her when she was little.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.635
Sweetheart,
you know where the pool is in that park?

24:31.386 --> 24:32.387
Okay, sweetheart...

24:33.263 --> 24:35.390
- I want you to go there, yeah?
- Okay.

24:35.473 --> 24:36.933
Wait for me. I will come for you.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.060
Do it now. Okay?

24:39.144 --> 24:42.731
- Okay. Okay. [breathing heavily]
- [siren wailing in distance]

24:46.484 --> 24:48.737
- You gotta go to her.
- What?

24:49.445 --> 24:50.822
I thought you said you were going.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.325
Yeah, I know what I said,
but it's gotta be you.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.536
How can I?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.370
She thinks I'm dead.

24:57.453 --> 24:59.831
- Hey, David...
- [laughs nervously]

24:59.915 --> 25:02.458
What am I supposed to do?
I'm supposed to go over and say...

25:03.084 --> 25:05.921
"Hey, baby, uh, I've been living
in a basement for a year.

25:06.004 --> 25:09.132
- I'm not dead. Let's get some cocoa"?
- Hey, look at me...

25:09.215 --> 25:10.216
Look at me.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.053
You're her father, right?

25:14.345 --> 25:15.889
You go to your little girl, okay?

25:15.972 --> 25:17.532
You meet me at the Greenpoint Terminal.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.392
If I don't show up by midnight,
go to Madani.

25:19.475 --> 25:21.603
You go only to Madani. Got it?

25:24.105 --> 25:26.357
[sniffles] What are you gonna do?

25:29.820 --> 25:32.322
I'm gonna wait here on these assholes.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.325
When they come,
I'll make 'em tell me where Sarah is.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.579
After that, I'm gonna kill 'em all.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.499
[breath trembling]

25:45.335 --> 25:47.963
[Sarah] God damn you, let us go!

25:48.964 --> 25:52.508
I told you,
I don't know anything else about Castle!

25:53.260 --> 25:54.511
[sobbing] I'm sorry, Mom.

25:55.136 --> 25:57.848
No, baby. Baby, it's all right.
It's not your fault.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.475
Are they gonna kill us?

26:03.061 --> 26:04.062
No.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.190
No. I will never let that happen.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.110
[crying]

26:11.319 --> 26:13.905
[Billy] And why didn't you know
this Lieberman guy was alive?

26:14.572 --> 26:17.158
Carson Wolf told me he was dead.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.120
Had no reason
to assume otherwise till now.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.763
Castle must have found him somehow,
and they're working together.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.834
This is getting way out of hand, Rawlins.

26:25.917 --> 26:30.130
We killed a bunch of Homeland agents.
Madani knows your name and now we're what?

26:30.213 --> 26:33.091
We're kidnapping women and kids
in broad daylight?

26:33.174 --> 26:35.927
How do you think
I got on the tip call line so fast?

26:36.594 --> 26:38.513
I used CIA apparatus.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.558
Got clearance for it
from the deputy director herself.

26:41.892 --> 26:46.271
We get caught, everyone looks bad.
No one wants that.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.650
- You give James my name?
- 'Course not. You're insulated.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.026
I made sure of it.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.445
Yeah, that's some bullshit,
and you know it.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.197
Frank Castle knows I'm involved now.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.617
Yes, he does.
None of us are safe until he's dead.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.788
Her cell phone told us
exactly where they are.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.373
You go kill them, it all ends tonight.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.375
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.461
I'm not exposing myself
any more than I already have.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.130
Any more than you are.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.425
Unless you wanna come with me.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.136
We can go do this together.

27:20.013 --> 27:22.098
We both know that's not happening.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.392
Yeah.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.187
That's what I thought.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.066
[elevator bell dings]

27:31.149 --> 27:34.069
- Deputy Director James.
- Rafi, how are ya?

27:34.152 --> 27:36.130
- Good to see you.
- [laughs] Nice to see you, too.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.238
- This way.
- Okay.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.242
Special Agent in Charge Madani.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.369
- Oh, good to meet you.
- We're in here.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.541
Thank you very much for coming, Marion.

27:48.624 --> 27:51.419
Okay, well, given that you called me
on my personal cell,

27:51.502 --> 27:53.755
it must be important.
Is this about the bombings?

27:53.839 --> 27:54.840
No, something else.

27:54.923 --> 27:58.634
Oh, well... here I am. Enlighten me.

27:58.718 --> 28:03.306
We have evidence
that one of your field agents

28:03.390 --> 28:06.101
was running an illegal
assassination program...

28:07.018 --> 28:09.520
funded by heroin from Kandahar.

28:11.857 --> 28:12.983
That's quite an accusation.

28:13.649 --> 28:16.152
They threw in some torture
for shits and giggles.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.948
When an Afghan National Policeman
I was working with found out,

28:20.031 --> 28:21.407
they murdered him, too.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.410
- Is there any evidence of this?
- It was taped.

28:24.494 --> 28:29.082
Marion, the agent in question
is William Rawlins.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.042
[scoffs] Bill...

28:31.709 --> 28:34.712
Bill Rawlins is a highly-decorated agent.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.923
But I... I'll look into it.
Of course I will.

28:37.007 --> 28:39.801
And if there's anything,
you'll be the first to know.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.220
Well, this is
a Homeland Security investigation.

28:42.303 --> 28:44.973
Well, I'm not sure what jurisdiction
Homeland Security has

28:45.056 --> 28:48.476
over CIA agents' conduct
on foreign soil, Agent Madani.

28:48.559 --> 28:51.730
And Rafi can tell you,
we generally clean our own dirty laundry.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.106
It's not that simple, Marion.

28:53.815 --> 28:58.027
Several of our agents were killed
in an operation not five miles from here.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.946
On US soil.

29:00.321 --> 29:01.740
May I view the tape?

29:01.823 --> 29:03.300
- [Dinah] No.
- I'm not talking to you.

29:03.324 --> 29:04.910
[Rafi] Rawlins went rogue,

29:04.993 --> 29:08.163
and I believe he's doing
whatever he has to, to cover his tracks.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.540
And people are dying. Our own people.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.002
I asked you here so we can deal with it...

29:15.545 --> 29:16.587
between us.

29:17.547 --> 29:18.548
[softly] Yeah.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.592
- Give us Rawlins.
- Okay, even if this were true,

29:21.676 --> 29:24.971
can you imagine the damage it would do
if it were made public?

29:25.055 --> 29:27.933
It would put our foreign policy back
ten years.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.393
I don't think the public
would be surprised in the slightest

29:30.476 --> 29:31.978
at the shit you people get up to.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.730
Young lady, show some respect.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.358
I have spent 30 years of my life

29:37.442 --> 29:40.278
working for this country
and everything it stands for.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.406
Don't presume to question my integrity.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.160
Look, I get it, this is personal for you.
That's great. I admire that.

29:47.243 --> 29:50.288
But when you've done this
as long as Rafi and I have,

29:50.371 --> 29:52.040
you learn that personal feelings

29:52.123 --> 29:55.293
are the first casualty
of serving your country well.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.921
- [cell phone vibrating]
- I'm due at the UN.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.758
- Marion, thanks again.
- I'm on my way down. [scoffs]

30:07.055 --> 30:08.139
That went well.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.185
She's a piece of work.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.520
I've known her a long time.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.357
Marion is one of the good ones.

30:18.733 --> 30:19.985
You remind me of her.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.778
I mean that as a compliment.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.868
So now what?

30:29.035 --> 30:32.831
We rattled. Let's see what shakes loose.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.000
[sighs]

31:50.825 --> 31:52.535
[Micro breathing heavily]

32:00.585 --> 32:01.711
Hey, Leo?

32:07.550 --> 32:11.721
I know you're expecting Frank, but, uh...
Uh, Pete, but he... he, uh...

32:13.014 --> 32:14.057
sent me.

32:21.397 --> 32:24.859
Leo, listen to my voice!

32:26.152 --> 32:27.153
It's Dad!

32:33.034 --> 32:34.160
Leo?

32:52.928 --> 32:54.180
[both crying]

33:04.232 --> 33:05.775
[Micro chuckling] Hey.

33:12.865 --> 33:13.908
[softly] Look at me.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.996
[sniffling] I promise
I'm gonna explain everything, okay?

33:18.079 --> 33:20.999
But right now, we gotta go, okay?
'Cause it's not safe here.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.918
- Okay?
- [chuckles] Okay.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.587
But... So, where's Pete?

33:28.589 --> 33:31.634
We're gonna, um...
We'll see him really soon.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.844
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.026
- [choking]
- [Frank grunting]

35:16.030 --> 35:17.115
[neck snapping]

35:19.159 --> 35:20.451
[choking]

36:14.672 --> 36:15.923
[sighs]

36:16.007 --> 36:18.759
Yeah, we're in the power station.
There's no one here.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.553
I'm sure. It's a basement.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.597
They were living here,
but there's no sign now.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.600
They've got a whole bunch
of computers in here, too.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.643
Heavy-duty setup, it looks like.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.104
And there's some torture video and, uh...

36:31.856 --> 36:33.316
some countdown running.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.359
You want us to bring it all back?

36:35.985 --> 36:37.695
No. No, don't touch it.

36:44.785 --> 36:47.247
If they weren't there,
how'd you find the place?

36:47.330 --> 36:48.414
The phone we tracked...

36:49.164 --> 36:50.500
it's right here on the desk.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.211
Shit. It's a trap. He's there!

36:54.045 --> 36:56.714
[dramatic music playing]

37:00.843 --> 37:01.886
[man] Shit.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.808
[man yells]

37:11.646 --> 37:12.855
[grunting]

37:18.528 --> 37:20.070
[rapid gunfire]

37:22.615 --> 37:24.284
- [Frank grunts]
- [screaming]

37:26.411 --> 37:27.412
[grunts]

37:28.413 --> 37:30.540
- [man yelling]
- [Frank grunting]

37:31.666 --> 37:33.334
- [yelling]
- [groaning]

37:36.086 --> 37:37.297
[yelling]

37:48.391 --> 37:49.391
[groans]

37:52.687 --> 37:54.229
- [groans]
- [grunting]

37:58.192 --> 37:59.277
[grunting]

38:06.158 --> 38:07.743
[Frank grunts]

38:33.936 --> 38:35.270
Russo!

38:36.439 --> 38:37.440
You hear me?

38:39.274 --> 38:41.276
I'm gonna watch you die!

38:46.741 --> 38:48.868
[all screaming]

38:56.709 --> 38:57.835
[groaning]

39:00.504 --> 39:02.882
[Frank yelling]

39:05.635 --> 39:06.761
[groaning]

39:09.805 --> 39:10.806
[grunts]

39:12.642 --> 39:13.893
[panting]

39:14.560 --> 39:16.854
Bill? That you?

39:19.314 --> 39:20.315
[grunts]

39:21.108 --> 39:22.568
- [yells]
- [groans]

39:24.278 --> 39:25.488
[yells]

39:25.571 --> 39:27.407
[both grunting]

39:28.366 --> 39:30.576
- [bones cracking]
- [both yelling]

39:39.460 --> 39:40.878
[groaning]

39:43.297 --> 39:46.133
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

39:52.264 --> 39:53.974
Russo!

40:03.609 --> 40:04.735
[man groaning]

40:16.831 --> 40:18.499
[groans]

40:26.215 --> 40:27.883
[panting]

40:43.649 --> 40:45.359
[man grunting]

41:07.757 --> 41:08.966
[yells]

41:09.049 --> 41:10.384
[groaning]

41:14.639 --> 41:15.640
Where's Russo?

41:17.099 --> 41:18.976
I... I don't know, man.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.812
[yells] Oh, come on!

41:22.271 --> 41:25.483
I really... [groans] I don't know.

41:26.692 --> 41:29.236
The woman. The kid.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.116
- Where'd they take 'em?
- I don't know, man. That was... [groans]

41:34.199 --> 41:36.577
That was need-to-know.
You know how it is.

41:37.787 --> 41:39.955
- I don't know anything.
- Fair enough.

42:13.488 --> 42:15.032
[sighs]

42:15.115 --> 42:16.951
[cell phone vibrating]

42:28.629 --> 42:29.714
[Billy] Frank?

42:33.718 --> 42:35.845
You know, the Billy Russo I knew...

42:39.181 --> 42:43.435
oh, he'd have the balls
to come himself, you know?

42:44.979 --> 42:47.314
Yeah, well, I got staff for that
these days, Frank.

42:47.982 --> 42:51.902
You know the saying
about having a dog and barking yourself?

42:53.112 --> 42:56.156
Someday, sometime,
this is gonna come down to you and me.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.534
Just know that, Bill.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.621
No, it isn't.

43:03.038 --> 43:05.082
You're a wanted man, Franky Boy.

43:05.165 --> 43:08.878
They'll catch up to you eventually.
Just like the last time.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.380
I guess we're both running
out of time then, huh, Bill?

43:11.964 --> 43:13.548
What's in those computers, Frank?

43:14.174 --> 43:18.638
- The woman and the kid, where are they?
- Oh, they're with me. Right here.

43:19.722 --> 43:20.931
Safe and sound.

43:22.307 --> 43:23.643
[Zach crying]

43:23.726 --> 43:25.227
Unless I say otherwise.

43:29.523 --> 43:30.565
He's got everything, Bill.

43:32.151 --> 43:35.404
Lieberman, he's got everything on you.

43:36.488 --> 43:39.116
I'mma tell you right now,
anything happens to that family...

43:39.491 --> 43:41.661
whole world will see it.
The whole world, Bill.

43:41.744 --> 43:44.955
- After that, you'll be done.
- And Zach and Sarah will be dead.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.958
You want that family back...

43:49.084 --> 43:51.879
I want Lieberman, and I want you.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.380
That sounds about right.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.009
I'll set up the exchange, then.

43:57.843 --> 43:59.594
If that's all right with you.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.389
Yeah, you got my number, Bill.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.592
Homeland Security has your name.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.654
They know about your operation.
They've informed me

44:40.678 --> 44:42.637
that five agents
have been killed pursuing this.

44:42.722 --> 44:44.682
Americans, right here in New York.

44:44.765 --> 44:47.935
This is not what we stand for, Bill.
Not what we do.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.062
- Wasn't me.
- [scoffs]

44:50.145 --> 44:51.772
A former marine named Billy Russo

44:51.856 --> 44:54.483
took it upon himself
to try and kill Castle.

44:54.566 --> 44:55.860
Your civilian asset?

44:55.943 --> 44:58.487
Because he was part
of your Kandahar operation?

44:58.570 --> 45:01.115
The fact that the military
was trafficking heroin

45:01.198 --> 45:02.491
is a matter of record.

45:02.574 --> 45:05.160
That can be laid at Russo's doorstep
very easily.

45:05.244 --> 45:08.705
Castle dies, Russo takes the fall,
the agency comes out clean.

45:09.539 --> 45:12.877
You've got it all worked out.
My God, man, listen to yourself.

45:12.960 --> 45:17.047
Marion, I have always admired you
because you're a realist.

45:17.714 --> 45:20.675
You've made hard choices
for the greater good. So am I.

45:20.760 --> 45:23.720
You've crossed a line.
Can you not see that?

45:23.804 --> 45:26.766
Why? Because it might become public?

45:26.849 --> 45:28.934
- I expected better of you than that.
- You expect...

45:29.018 --> 45:30.770
What exactly do you expect?

45:30.853 --> 45:33.355
A little loyalty to one of your own.

45:33.939 --> 45:36.108
So, what are we talking about here?

45:36.691 --> 45:39.028
Are you gonna hand me over to Homeland?

45:39.111 --> 45:42.364
You're going to expose all this?
It'll take you down with me.

45:42.447 --> 45:46.618
Hell, it'll throw relations
with whole nations into disarray.

45:47.077 --> 45:51.206
And for what? For one dead Afghan
and a criminal lunatic?

45:52.041 --> 45:56.003
We can give Homeland their win
and keep the agency clean.

45:57.587 --> 46:02.802
Billy Russo punched his own ticket
when he killed those Homeland agents.

46:02.885 --> 46:04.178
Justice will be served,

46:04.261 --> 46:07.222
and the rest of the country
can remain blissfully unaware.

46:08.223 --> 46:12.102
You've given 30 years
to the agency, Marion.

46:12.812 --> 46:15.689
That will mean nothing
if we don't protect it.

46:19.609 --> 46:20.777
All right.

46:21.820 --> 46:22.820
Burn Russo.

46:23.864 --> 46:24.907
Yes, ma'am.

46:24.990 --> 46:27.576
- And then we're done. That's the deal.
- Marion...

46:27.659 --> 46:29.870
There is no place for you in my agency.

46:29.954 --> 46:30.996
Marion, wait.

46:31.080 --> 46:35.000
No. We protect the agency,
and then you will resign your post.

46:35.084 --> 46:36.376
It's for the greater good.

46:37.419 --> 46:40.172
But that hardly motivates me
to make this go away.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.590
Oh, I think it would.

46:41.673 --> 46:44.301
Because if you don't,
I will hand you to Homeland myself,

46:44.384 --> 46:46.154
and see you in prison
for the rest of your life,

46:46.178 --> 46:49.181
shit on my shoes or not. You disgust me.

47:01.109 --> 47:03.111
[siren wailing in distance]

47:07.199 --> 47:08.742
You said midnight, Dad.

47:10.744 --> 47:11.871
You think Pete's okay?

47:13.372 --> 47:14.957
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.251
No, no, no. We're in the right place.

47:17.334 --> 47:21.255
I'm sure he's okay. Uh... we'll just wait.

47:22.882 --> 47:24.091
He'd wait for me.

47:28.512 --> 47:30.347
[indistinct chatter]

47:30.430 --> 47:31.431
[Micro] You cold?

47:32.307 --> 47:34.476
- [engine starting]
- [pop song playing on radio]

47:34.559 --> 47:35.810
[turns radio off]

47:36.520 --> 47:37.521
Wait.

47:38.188 --> 47:41.441
- What?
- I like that song.

47:43.152 --> 47:45.737
- [softly] Here you go.
- [pop song continues on radio]

47:45.820 --> 47:48.365
Me and my friends made up a dance to it.

47:49.658 --> 47:51.785
It's stupid, but it's fun.

47:52.619 --> 47:55.289
I bet it's not stupid.
You are an amazing dancer.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.046
How would you know that?

48:05.299 --> 48:07.676
I never, ever stopped thinking about you.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.016
- [knocking on window]
- [turns off radio]

48:14.891 --> 48:15.892
It's okay.

48:18.687 --> 48:20.439
What are you doing here?

48:20.522 --> 48:23.400
[Frank] It's okay. I called her.

48:26.861 --> 48:29.489
[Micro] How long have you been here?
We were worried.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.409
Yeah. I had to make sure she came alone.

48:34.119 --> 48:37.872
How about it, Madani?
You gonna pull your weapon on me again?

48:39.583 --> 48:40.584
Do I have to?

48:40.667 --> 48:41.835
[chuckles]

48:42.627 --> 48:44.546
- [Micro] You all right?
- Yeah.

48:44.629 --> 48:45.965
Can't believe you called her.

48:46.840 --> 48:48.258
Honestly, neither can I.

48:48.968 --> 48:51.761
Ah, if he trusts you, I guess I do, too.

48:53.722 --> 48:54.723
Excuse me.

49:06.943 --> 49:10.072
Hey. You did good, kid.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.533
You knew he was alive all this time?

49:15.244 --> 49:16.245
[softly] Yeah.

49:17.746 --> 49:19.123
I'm sorry about that.

49:21.500 --> 49:24.419
I don't know what to call you now.
It seems stupid to call you Pete.

49:27.756 --> 49:28.798
I'm Frank.

49:29.924 --> 49:31.010
Frank Castle.

49:33.678 --> 49:35.430
He's a lot scarier than Pete.

49:38.475 --> 49:39.476
[Frank] Yeah.

49:40.769 --> 49:41.895
Yeah, sweetheart, I...

49:42.771 --> 49:44.314
I guess he is.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.092
[sighs]

50:13.677 --> 50:14.678
Shit.

50:19.099 --> 50:20.850
[dramatic music playing]
