and they tortured the
hell out of this guy,

01:01:17.282 --> 01:01:18.865

you, like, a million times

01:01:25.999 --> 01:01:27.499

something wrong.

01:05:50.888 --> 01:05:52.472

JACK: How'd you know?

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:57.185
The Council already
knew about my past.

01:05:57.186 --> 01:06:00.188
It didn't make any sense for them to
issue a warrant after all these years.

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.400
You knew the Judges?

01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:04.693
Yeah, they tracked me down

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:06.570
after the last of the
great cities burned.

01:06:07.947 --> 01:06:09.072
By the time they found me,

01:06:09.073 --> 01:06:12.158
I'd already killed two of
my old business partners.

01:06:12.159 --> 01:06:13.243
JACK: Why'd you kill 'em?

01:06:13.244 --> 01:06:15.161
DRIFTER: My company
built planes,

01:06:15.162 --> 01:06:18.331
and after the crash, my
partners betrayed me

01:06:18.332 --> 01:06:20.584
and sold out to the
corporate militias.

01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:24.170
They took over my plant and started
building bombers for the war.

01:06:25.131 --> 01:06:27.674
Whenever I heard news of a
city being annihilated,

01:06:27.675 --> 01:06:29.593
I knew the plane that
delivered the bombs

01:06:29.594 --> 01:06:31.177
likely had my name on it.

01:06:33.806 --> 01:06:36.850
The Council offered me a
position as the tenth Judge.

01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:39.644
They needed someone on the
inside who knew all the players,

01:06:40.813 --> 01:06:42.105
but I refused.

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:45.150
I spent enough time
behind a desk.

01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:49.654
I needed to get my hands dirty.

01:06:51.866 --> 01:06:53.909
So I became the first
bounty killer.

01:06:56.037 --> 01:06:57.495

fulfill its potential

mother in the back

fact that every woman

with wants to kill you?

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:33.425

to think about it.

should have told me.
