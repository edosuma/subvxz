01:59.500 --> 02:00.875
Hello?

02:19.583 --> 02:20.625
Hello?

02:24.750 --> 02:25.791
Hello?

02:29.041 --> 02:31.083
This is Jens Kaufmann.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.000
I always thought
we were safe here.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.500
Suddenly you realize
nowhere is safe.

04:15.166 --> 04:18.541
It's terrifying that someone
took a picture of Leon here.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.208
We were here
and it still happened.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.916
And instead of believing
and helping you, they suspect you!

04:25.291 --> 04:27.708
Are they allowed to do that?

04:30.500 --> 04:33.250
What will they do
if they decide you're guilty?

04:39.750 --> 04:41.416
I don't know what to do.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.958
Shit! - They're just
trying to intimidate us.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.375
Everything will be fine,
I promise.

04:53.416 --> 04:55.583
Hanna! - So we just
shut down the computer

04:55.875 --> 04:58.541
and everything will be fine?
What do you want to do?

05:00.291 --> 05:01.166
What are you doing?

05:02.208 --> 05:04.875
Fixing the vase.
- It cannot be fixed.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.083
Please use all available doors.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.208
All aboard.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.708
Doors closing.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.000
A ticket to Frankfurt.

07:06.375 --> 07:09.458
"Justitia in suo cuique
tribuendo cernitur."

07:09.833 --> 07:13.125
"Justice is recognized by the
fact that it renders everyone

07:13.500 --> 07:16.333
his or her due."
Thank you very much.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.208
You cannot be serious.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.083
Thomas...
- If you want something, enroll

07:33.458 --> 07:34.916
and get an appointment. Okay?

07:35.291 --> 07:37.958
We used to make fun of people
who rotted in their offices.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.666
People can change.
Maybe you should try.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.416
Dalton gave me
the hacker's contact.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.625
The guy is dead.

07:49.083 --> 07:52.125
You think someone would set
themself on fire and jump out a window?

07:53.458 --> 07:56.333
I wouldn't be bothering you
but it's getting worse.

07:57.541 --> 07:59.416
I got a warning from the police.

07:59.791 --> 08:02.958
I'm on video allegedly
buying chemicals in a supply store.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.791
But I've never been there.
It's all manipulated.

08:06.166 --> 08:09.583
Here... A flight
to Frankfurt I never booked.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.125
Look for evidence.
You know how it works.

08:12.708 --> 08:16.000
I've done it for you more than once.
- One more time, please.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.250
Just one more time.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.666
Thomas, please.
- So how's my nephew?

08:25.708 --> 08:27.375
Leon's good.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.875
Fuck it.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.125
You think someone
can watch us through that?

08:47.708 --> 08:49.916
They can.
They took a photo of Leon.

08:50.833 --> 08:54.875
I'll do it too. I watch
"Sex and the City" in the bath,

08:55.833 --> 08:59.500
and other things.
That no one needs to see.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.333
Knock, knock.

09:04.708 --> 09:07.375
Bonjour.
- Ah, bonjour.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.125
One moment.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.166
We can sit over there.
- Okay.

09:15.708 --> 09:20.041
I wouldn't mind you watching
through my camera. - Wish me luck.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.625
Let's get started?
- Mhm.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.041
We agreed
on black and white sketches

09:30.416 --> 09:34.375
but I already have a layout for Wizzy
with bright, cheerful colors.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.791
Let me show you...

09:42.125 --> 09:45.583
The children should have fun
and not realize they're learning.

09:46.416 --> 09:47.458
Right?

09:48.375 --> 09:49.750
Yes.
- Good.

09:57.375 --> 09:58.041
That's it?

10:00.083 --> 10:02.416
This is all
you managed to come up with?

10:04.250 --> 10:06.541
It's even more
than what we agreed on.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.916
I think it's good.

10:12.625 --> 10:13.541
Good.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.916
I don't want 'good', Hanna.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.583
I want the best.

10:22.916 --> 10:25.666
I wonder if you want the best.
- Naturally.

10:26.041 --> 10:29.291
Then show me
you're better than this.

10:39.833 --> 10:40.833
I don't know you, Hanna.

10:41.833 --> 10:46.166
You see... I don't know
what's going on in your life.

10:46.541 --> 10:49.375
You might feel a little stressed.
- I can do it.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.833
I can do better.

10:55.208 --> 10:56.666
Well we agree then.

11:09.375 --> 11:12.500
Come on.

11:17.541 --> 11:18.833
That's him.

11:33.041 --> 11:35.625
Fuck!
He knew where the cameras were.

11:55.666 --> 11:58.583
Everything okay?
- All good.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.916
You look a little tired. Stress?

12:06.541 --> 12:09.125
No problems.
- You sure? - Yes.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.000
If the police showed up
this morning

12:11.375 --> 12:13.416
and searched our computers,
would that be a problem?

12:13.708 --> 12:14.791
Police?

12:15.166 --> 12:18.500
Yes, you should have seen it.
I mean everyone else did.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.541
You've earned a vacation.

12:20.916 --> 12:24.625
I can't take a vacation.
- Then call it permanent time off.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.875
You got the job, Katja.
Congratulations.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.125
Huh?

12:28.791 --> 12:31.375
Maybe you'll get lucky,
she might need an assistant.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.750
Come on.

12:36.916 --> 12:38.375
What?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.041
It's fine.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.250
Unknown number.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.541
Franke.

13:16.916 --> 13:18.000
Hanna?

13:21.583 --> 13:22.458
Hello?

14:34.416 --> 14:36.791
Hello, Lukas.
- Who's this?

14:37.166 --> 14:39.958
Imagine that I'm God.
If you cross me,

14:40.333 --> 14:41.833
I can get very unpleasant.

14:42.208 --> 14:45.125
Take that package to Frankfurt.
Don't open it.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.541
GPS data will follow.
Then it's all over.

14:47.916 --> 14:49.791
You don't tell me
when it's over, you bastard.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.500
Because it's already over.

14:52.541 --> 14:55.875
Leave my family alone and get
out of my life, you got it?

14:57.916 --> 15:01.000
Stay on the line. Don't you
hang up on me!

15:36.125 --> 15:38.125
I hate this.

15:44.208 --> 15:46.250
This is the last time.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.541
We checked Franke's accounts.

15:48.916 --> 15:51.416
They're all
regular transactions.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.750
Insurance, day-care, oil

15:54.125 --> 15:56.041
and mortgage.
Maybe he feared losing his home.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.291
We secured the electronics,

16:00.666 --> 16:04.416
and we got the footage
of him buying the chemicals.

16:04.666 --> 16:06.458
Now then... Here's my question.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.458
Why would Franke go out

16:08.833 --> 16:12.375
and buy chemicals when the hotel
is full of cleaning supplies?

16:19.083 --> 16:21.125
Sandra, you're wheezing.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.583
I'm always ahead of my asthma
by a pack of cigarettes.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.250
Okay... Hypothetically,

16:31.375 --> 16:33.666
with the chemicals
and electronics he bought,

16:34.041 --> 16:37.333
if he builds a bomb,
what kind of power will it have?

16:37.708 --> 16:40.250
Enough explosive power
to destroy a whole block?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.750
Would you just
shut up for a second?

16:45.041 --> 16:47.541
I'm sharing my ideas,
like people do in a team.

16:47.916 --> 16:49.916
I like to think alone.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.875
Where are
these chemicals right now?

17:04.625 --> 17:06.333
Do you know?

17:08.833 --> 17:11.875
I don't know.
That's a good point.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.208
How's the little one? First day
of school's exciting. - Sure.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.250
So, your contact lens solution.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.125
Some candy for your boy.
- Thanks.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.625
And the Pranodan for your husband.
He knows how to take it?

17:29.250 --> 17:30.875
PRANODAN PSYCHOACTIVE MEDICATION

17:33.541 --> 17:38.416
This isn't ours. - It is,
the order was faxed from your doctor's.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.833
You're sure?

17:42.208 --> 17:43.500
Absolutely.

17:44.916 --> 17:48.791
FRANKE ... DIAGNOSIS PSYCHOSIS

17:52.375 --> 17:56.166
You think after 10 years I'd take
these again and not tell you?

17:58.958 --> 18:00.208
Oh, man!

18:04.416 --> 18:06.458
Do I look like I need them?

18:08.541 --> 18:11.500
Why are you so offended?
That's not the point.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.333
Then what is the point?

18:14.541 --> 18:17.166
I don't want us
hiding things from each other.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.625
We don't.
- It's been a lot, the last few days.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.833
The package. Pranodan.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.250
And this Julia...

18:27.625 --> 18:29.541
You're starting again?
- Look...

18:29.916 --> 18:32.916
I don't get random photos
of guys' nude asses, remember?

18:33.291 --> 18:35.250
Don't you understand
none of this is real?

18:39.958 --> 18:43.083
You don't trust me.
- I'm having my doubts.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.833
Is that woman real?

18:53.791 --> 18:55.958
Yes, I guess she is real.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.500
But I don't know her.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.625
What is happening to us?

19:11.083 --> 19:14.458
Whatever happens, however it looks,
you have to trust me.

19:14.833 --> 19:17.916
We are real. And that's
the only thing that matters.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.875
Nothing else.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.625
Please use all available doors.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.375
Want me to take that?
- It's okay.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.333
I'll get the shirt
and you get the pencils, alright?

20:39.708 --> 20:41.208
I thought we'd do it together.
- Balloons!

20:42.041 --> 20:44.625
Leon, wait.
- I'll be quick. - Okay.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.458
Don't run away.
Is this okay?

20:46.833 --> 20:48.458
Yes.
- Thanks.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.125
Do you want a balloon
maybe help you blend in?

20:56.500 --> 20:57.541
Leon?

20:59.208 --> 21:01.291
Leon? Leon!

21:04.125 --> 21:05.291
Leon?

21:16.041 --> 21:16.958
Leon?

21:19.541 --> 21:20.333
Leon!

21:22.708 --> 21:23.958
Leon!

21:25.208 --> 21:26.750
I'm sorry.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.541
Sorry.

22:07.875 --> 22:08.916
Leon?

22:10.208 --> 22:11.875
Daddy, I got a present for you.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.833
Put it down right now. On the floor.
- Why?

22:17.750 --> 22:19.791
Who gave it to you?
- A man.

22:20.166 --> 22:24.208
A man? What man?
- I don't know.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.083
What did he look like?

22:30.458 --> 22:32.500
I don't know.

22:35.791 --> 22:37.000
Coordinates?

22:37.166 --> 22:40.916
It was your birthday. I thought
a present would make you feel good.

22:41.291 --> 22:44.875
Listen. We never ever
take packages from strangers.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.416
Not all people are nice. Okay?
- Yes.

22:47.791 --> 22:50.208
I told you many times
not to go anywhere.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.625
Okay.

23:06.833 --> 23:08.750
There you are!
- Come on. - I think...

23:09.125 --> 23:11.500
Let's go, please!
- What's that?

23:11.875 --> 23:13.000
A present for me.
- From who?

23:13.375 --> 23:14.666
The hacker.
- What?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.708
He tried yesterday.
- Get rid of it!

23:17.083 --> 23:19.916
He wants me to bring it to Frankfurt.
- Why?

23:20.541 --> 23:23.375
Here.
I'll take it to the police.

23:23.791 --> 23:25.916
Take Leon home, okay? Please?
- Yes.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.333
Bye.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.750
Come, Leon. Come.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.750
Miss Jansen, please.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.458
What are you doing at the police?
Your plane won't wait.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.958
Fuck you!

24:44.458 --> 24:46.791
TAKE VIDEO CALL

24:54.250 --> 24:55.375
Hey. Update?

24:55.750 --> 24:57.500
Hey. I'm still here.
They're making me wait.

24:57.875 --> 24:59.000
What's up?
- What?

24:59.375 --> 25:01.791
It was you who called.
- No, you made the call.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.291
I didn't call you.

25:05.708 --> 25:06.708
Lukas?

25:06.958 --> 25:08.458
Hanna?
- What is it?

25:09.750 --> 25:12.000
Someone's targeting you.
Get down.

25:12.916 --> 25:13.958
Please, someone's targeting you.

25:14.333 --> 25:15.291
Get down!

25:15.458 --> 25:19.083
Right now! It could be
a shooter! Get down, Hanna! Hurry!

25:19.500 --> 25:21.000
Come on. Let's go.
- Hanna!

25:21.375 --> 25:24.000
Let's go! Hurry!
- Hanna!

25:25.083 --> 25:26.250
Fuck!

25:36.541 --> 25:38.083
Where?
- Room four.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.291
So, Mr. Franke...

25:55.625 --> 25:58.250
There was a laser on you.
- What do you mean, laser?

25:58.625 --> 26:01.083
Stay away from the windows
till the police arrive, okay?

26:01.458 --> 26:02.583
Lukas...

26:02.958 --> 26:04.916
It's about this damn package.

26:05.958 --> 26:08.583
I'll do what he wants.
I'll take it to Frankfurt.

26:09.250 --> 26:10.708
I love you.

26:19.833 --> 26:22.541
Why didn't you stay
at the police station?

26:23.041 --> 26:25.375
You'd have saved yourself
a lot of trouble.

26:28.958 --> 26:32.833
Your family ever deal with
a sniper? - Sniper?

26:34.125 --> 26:36.916
Isn't that story
a little absurd?

26:37.958 --> 26:40.416
I thought
it was the job of the BND...

26:41.000 --> 26:43.541
To find out
if it's absurd or not.

26:56.125 --> 26:58.333
So did you notice the red point?

26:58.708 --> 27:01.208
No. It was on my forehead.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.416
My husband saw it on his cell.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.708
We get this kind of thing a lot.

27:06.083 --> 27:09.041
Probably some kids screwing
around with laser pointers.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.458
Of course, for your safety,
we'll check it out.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.791
No worries at all.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.250
Maybe it didn't happen at all.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.500
Sometimes
imaginations can run wild.

27:39.541 --> 27:41.000
With the stress.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.541
I feel much better now.
Thanks for your support.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.541
Just doing my job.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.625
Good, then...

27:55.000 --> 27:56.333
I'll see you out.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.625
I can find my way.

28:32.916 --> 28:34.541
Once more.

28:55.958 --> 28:57.416
Have a good flight.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.333
The package!

29:52.791 --> 29:54.625
So are we all set?
Can I leave?

29:55.458 --> 29:57.416
I did what you asked,
so can I leave?

29:57.791 --> 30:01.750
Who sent you? - I never met him.
- What did he tell you?

30:02.125 --> 30:04.625
He said "Deliver the package,
then it would be all over."

30:05.583 --> 30:08.625
Let me guess.
You were hacked and extorted.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.000
How do you know that?

30:22.041 --> 30:24.083
Because it happened to me.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.083
Give me your phone.
- Why?

30:32.666 --> 30:34.125
What for?

30:36.250 --> 30:38.708
Are you crazy?
- He mustn't know everything.

30:39.083 --> 30:42.416
He already knows we're here.
- But not what you'll do next.

30:43.458 --> 30:45.791
I only want my old life back.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.250
There, take your package.

30:49.541 --> 30:51.000
I'm gone.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.375
Take the package!

31:02.250 --> 31:04.666
Don't you want
to know what's in it?

31:39.583 --> 31:42.208
So tell me. Why us?

31:46.458 --> 31:48.541
Mutual enemies.

31:50.625 --> 31:52.333
I don't have any enemies.

31:53.208 --> 31:54.666
I do.

32:02.375 --> 32:06.833
I blog about politics,
intelligence, industry, military.

32:07.208 --> 32:10.625
People in the shadows.
Some don't like that.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.583
I don't get it.

32:19.791 --> 32:21.083
Coincidence?

32:22.166 --> 32:23.416
Or a game?

32:26.416 --> 32:28.166
Maybe bad luck.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.041
Yes?

32:56.333 --> 32:59.833
See, Lena?
I told you he'd do it.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.791
Let's go.
- Why?

33:07.166 --> 33:09.583
He said we've
accomplished our task.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.458
I hope I never see you again.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.291
Agreed.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.958
Next time
a stranger talks to you

33:48.333 --> 33:51.250
you can only respond
if he knows the code word.

33:51.625 --> 33:53.000
What's a code word, Mom?

33:53.375 --> 33:56.666
A code word's a secret word
known only to friends.

33:57.041 --> 33:59.083
And Daddy and you.
- That's right.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.125
Want to choose one?

34:02.666 --> 34:05.208
Johnny always calls me Robbie.
- Yes.

34:05.583 --> 34:06.916
Okay. Robbie.

34:07.291 --> 34:09.333
Robbie.
- Super.

34:10.291 --> 34:14.333
So one more sleepy time,
then it's your big day.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.458
Robbie.

34:50.125 --> 34:53.333
Sorry about your phone.
Here's my number just in case. Lena.

35:34.791 --> 35:36.291
Hello?
- Hanna?

35:37.083 --> 35:38.500
I delivered it. It's over.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.500
Oh, Lukas. What's this number?

35:41.875 --> 35:45.000
My old phone was broken. -
Please put your phone in the basket.

35:45.375 --> 35:48.458
My plane leaves soon.
I'll hurry. I love you.

35:48.833 --> 35:50.458
Will you be here in time?

35:52.375 --> 35:53.750
Lukas?

35:56.875 --> 35:57.833
All done!

36:04.291 --> 36:05.791
Nervous?

36:10.166 --> 36:11.791
When will Daddy be home?

36:13.208 --> 36:14.333
He'll see you at school.

36:14.708 --> 36:17.541
Good. Then I'll get my bookbag.
- Yes.

36:31.625 --> 36:32.750
Arms up.

36:37.375 --> 36:38.916
Turn around.

36:42.958 --> 36:44.916
Okay, done.
- Thanks.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.166
Excuse me, sir.
- Something wrong?

36:54.041 --> 36:54.916
Follow me.

36:59.583 --> 37:04.166
70. 63. 56. 49.

37:04.541 --> 37:07.916
42. 35. 28.

37:16.916 --> 37:18.958
Here we go!

37:23.166 --> 37:24.208
Delete.

37:39.541 --> 37:40.375
Shit.

37:40.958 --> 37:44.333
70. 63. 56.

37:44.708 --> 37:45.458
49.

37:45.833 --> 37:47.875
No.

37:50.541 --> 37:52.333
No, no!

38:27.208 --> 38:28.250
Fuck.

38:32.166 --> 38:35.708
We welcome
to our podium Mike Heinz.

38:40.166 --> 38:43.000
Next up will be Lisa Schulz.

38:48.750 --> 38:51.458
Now we'd like
to welcome Leon Franke.

38:58.416 --> 39:00.916
Next to the podium Sven Lehmann.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.125
No, this seat is taken.

39:10.208 --> 39:12.458
I said this seat is taken.

39:15.541 --> 39:16.791
I'm Julia.

39:23.041 --> 39:26.708
Your husband
and I slept together.
