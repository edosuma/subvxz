WEBVTT

00:17.475 --> 00:18.809
ANNOUNCER: Stranded!

00:20.520 --> 00:24.398
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano,

00:24.482 --> 00:26.483
are caught in the middle
of a treacherous battle

00:26.568 --> 00:28.902
between good and evil.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.239
The scales now tipped
toward the dark side,

00:32.323 --> 00:34.491
our three warriors
must guard against attack

00:34.576 --> 00:36.577
as they plan their escape.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.580
A great weight has been placed
on Anakin's shoulders,

00:39.664 --> 00:43.584
for it is now that he must face
who he really is.

00:52.927 --> 00:56.263
I'm getting a little tired
of how unreliable the weather is here.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.682
Some might say that's part of the appeal.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.769
You did well, Anakin. How do you feel?

01:02.187 --> 01:05.314
(SIGHS) I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing by leaving.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.274
The son is consumed by the dark side.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.945
And if we stay, we may be used
to the dark side's advantage.

01:12.781 --> 01:16.617
Well, you want the bad news
or the really bad news?

01:16.910 --> 01:20.746
Well, let's try the bad news,
laced with a little optimism.

01:20.955 --> 01:25.042
We've got two cracked silo pins,
a busted power converter,

01:25.126 --> 01:27.795
the engines should be
fired twice to dump debris,

01:27.921 --> 01:30.464
and the backup vents need charging.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.925
Sounds terribly downbeat.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.137
Can it be fixed?

01:37.514 --> 01:41.975
Uh, I can re-route the primary initiator,
weld the dampening vents,

01:42.102 --> 01:45.145
and that might give us enough power
to leave the atmosphere.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.148
After that, I have no guarantees
she'll hold together.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.485
We'll take our chances.
Better than staying here.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.493
Where are you going?

01:59.619 --> 02:00.911
To see the father.

02:00.995 --> 02:05.082
I'm not convinced that the son
will be contained here without our help.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.583
Perhaps we should make a stand.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.709
Anakin.

02:07.794 --> 02:12.464
If I don't get the father's blessing to leave,
it'll haunt me forever.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.417
Forgive me, Daughter.

02:48.543 --> 02:53.714
I am an old fool who believed
he could control the future.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.383
Now you are gone,

02:58.178 --> 03:00.679
and all is lost.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.559
Sleep well, my child.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.898
Sleep free.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.699
(RUMBLING)

03:24.245 --> 03:26.455
You should have left by now.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.582
Our ship needs repairs.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.543
Do not underestimate my son.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.756
He will seek your ship
to escape our isolation

03:36.257 --> 03:38.884
and sow terror through the universe.

03:39.761 --> 03:44.097
And while you are here,
he will use you to do it.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.644
What will you do now that he's
given himself over to the dark side?

03:49.229 --> 03:54.274
It is my actions that have unleashed
great danger on the universe.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.778
I must kill him.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.947
But he's too powerful for you alone.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.448
Hmm. Perhaps.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.909
Perhaps not.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.161
The Force will decide.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.621
I can help you.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.124
The choice is no longer yours to make.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.710
Both our destinies are clouded.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.839
This place is strong with the Force.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.635
Darkness has no hold here.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.804
Go.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.683
Ask, and you will know what to do.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.327
You have grown strong and powerful,
just as I imagined.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.329
Master.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.165
Do you believe you are the chosen one?

04:52.542 --> 04:54.167
How can I know?

04:54.669 --> 04:57.004
I can tell you what I believe.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.840
I believe you will bring
balance to the Force.

04:59.882 --> 05:03.010
That you will face your demons
and save the universe.

05:03.052 --> 05:07.180
And this creature of the dark side?
Do I leave or do I stay and kill him?

05:07.265 --> 05:08.598
Neither.

05:09.225 --> 05:12.936
Look deeper. You will find another way.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.896
I don't understand.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.857
Not far from here there is a place

05:16.899 --> 05:19.359
which is strong
in the dark side of the Force.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.945
You must go there.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.073
And destroy the son?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.576
Remember your training, Anakin.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.536
Trust your instincts.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.079
Master!

05:31.539 --> 05:32.789
Master!

05:45.094 --> 05:47.763
Might I suggest less sleeping
and a little more work?

05:49.807 --> 05:51.683
Sorry, Master Kenobi.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.269
Here, this should help.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.524
We need to change plans.
You must focus on the firing drives.

05:59.609 --> 06:00.776
Disengage them.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.196
But I'm almost finished putting
this junk heap back together and now...

06:04.280 --> 06:07.616
Just do as I say. We don't have much time.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.204
You're the boss.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.042
Where's Anakin?

06:17.710 --> 06:22.547
He came to me for guidance,
but at the crossroad, only he can choose.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.217
The Force will be his guide now.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.512
I don't like this. What have you done?

06:29.013 --> 06:30.847
I have done nothing.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.477
I am merely letting the will
of the Force take shape.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.646
Where has he gone?

06:38.731 --> 06:41.024
To the well of the dark side.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.412
Welcome.

07:36.038 --> 07:39.040
I believe there has been
a misunderstanding.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.211
We really don't have to be enemies.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.714
You murdered your sister.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.507
The Force is out of balance.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.384
I have to stop you.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.052
Must you?

07:51.929 --> 07:53.430
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)

07:55.892 --> 07:58.560
Anakin has gone
to confront your son, hasn't he?

07:58.603 --> 08:05.233
Deep within this planet exists a place
where all that is dark is channeled.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.235
And how do I get there?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.237
You cannot interfere.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.908
The way I see it,
if we were not supposed to interfere,

08:13.034 --> 08:16.286
Ahsoka and I wouldn't be here
in the first place.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.080
Look after the ship,
I'm going to find Anakin.

08:28.925 --> 08:33.762
There is no use for such
crude implements here.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.098
I have a gift for you.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.935
I have had enough of your trickery.

08:40.269 --> 08:43.605
Oh, but you'll like this one, I promise.

08:45.650 --> 08:50.237
What if I could show you the future?

08:57.620 --> 09:00.789
No! No! Stop it!

09:01.457 --> 09:06.294
Know yourself.
Know what you will become!

09:18.140 --> 09:20.183
(GRUNTING)

09:22.311 --> 09:23.979
I will not look!

09:25.815 --> 09:28.149
DARTH SIDIOUS:
The Force is strong with you.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.279
-Anakin, please!
-You were my brother, Anakin!

09:32.321 --> 09:34.072
DARTH SIDIOUS:
A powerful sith you will be.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.991
ANAKIN: I hate you!

09:38.411 --> 09:41.746
No, no, no!

09:41.831 --> 09:43.081
(ECHOING)

10:00.975 --> 10:03.351
I will do such terrible things.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.770
Yes.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.608
But it doesn't have to be that way.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.278
The choice is still yours to make.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.697
How?

10:16.324 --> 10:20.327
The future, by its nature, can be changed.

10:20.369 --> 10:27.042
Join me, and together we will destroy
this Emperor you see in your visions.

10:27.168 --> 10:32.547
Then, we shall end war, corruption,
and suffering throughout the galaxy.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.133
Will we bring peace?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.302
Of course.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.488
(BEEPING)

11:01.077 --> 11:02.077
Finally!

11:02.203 --> 11:06.414
This is Jedi Shuttle 634
calling on all secure channels for help.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.752
Do you read? I repeat,
we are stranded and need immediate evac.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.337
Come in, please!

11:35.194 --> 11:36.945
Anakin, are you all right?

11:38.072 --> 11:40.448
There has been a change of plan.

11:42.785 --> 11:43.952
Sorry.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.206
You will not understand
what I have to do to end the Clone War.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.543
You will try to stop me.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.088
(GROANING)

11:58.467 --> 12:00.301
Anakin, why?

12:00.970 --> 12:02.345
I'm sorry.

12:02.513 --> 12:07.684
I have seen that it is the Jedi
who will stand in the way of peace.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.983
He's mine now.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.570
(LAUGHING)

12:27.997 --> 12:32.041
OBI-WAN: Ahsoka, come in, please.
Can you hear me? Ahsoka!

12:32.168 --> 12:34.794
Yes, Master. Any success with Anakin?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.505
No, quite the opposite.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.133
Master. What are you saying?

12:40.176 --> 12:44.012
Anakin has joined with the son.
Do not engage him.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.181
-But...
-Just do as I say.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.476
Listen to me. You have to disable the ship.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.687
But I just finished putting it back together.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.647
Ahsoka, please, listen.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.525
We have to prevent Anakin
and the son from leaving.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.360
Yes, Master.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.529
(WHOOSHING)

13:17.713 --> 13:20.715
Ahsoka, what have you done?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.383
(WHOOSHING)

13:22.551 --> 13:23.676
Ahsoka!

13:37.608 --> 13:38.983
(GRUNTING)

13:43.405 --> 13:45.323
Hmm, nice job.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.950
What took you so long?

13:48.661 --> 13:49.828
Here.

13:50.287 --> 13:53.456
I did as you said.
The shuttle's going nowhere without that.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.751
Good, that gives us some time
to rescue Anakin.

14:02.633 --> 14:06.302
I can't make contact with anybody.
I don't think anyone will hear my signal.

14:06.428 --> 14:10.598
My father still has hold over this realm,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.852
but I will be able to draw
any ship here soon.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.689
If I know my old Master,
he, too, will try to stop us.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.817
Together, with your father,
they could be a formidable opponent.

14:21.443 --> 14:25.154
I can turn the tide in our favor. Stay here.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.625
What did he show you?

14:38.460 --> 14:41.963
I've seen what I become
and I cannot let that happen.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.632
And for this you join him?

14:45.467 --> 14:50.221
Your destiny can change just as quickly
as the love in one's heart can fade.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.057
Nothing is set in stone.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.810
But I will cause so much pain.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.355
If there is to be balance,

14:59.481 --> 15:03.860
what you have seen must be forgotten.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.946
So cold.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.950
It's ironic, my sister.

15:52.034 --> 15:56.120
You were the only one I truly loved.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.267
Where am I?

16:18.519 --> 16:21.187
I have brought you back to my monastery.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.231
(EXHALES) What happened?

16:23.691 --> 16:26.609
My son broke the laws of time

16:26.694 --> 16:30.279
and showed you
what you should never have seen.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.282
I don't remember.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.035
I have erased that time.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.122
We shall never know.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.415
AHSOKA: Master!

16:50.175 --> 16:51.509
Are you all right?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.469
I think so,

16:53.554 --> 16:56.055
but we must stop the son once and for all.

16:56.598 --> 17:00.935
We have little time,
and you will get only one chance.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.814
You know what you must do.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.442
How quaint.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.778
My own personal send-off.

17:13.073 --> 17:16.367
I ask you one last time.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.995
Do not leave, my son.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.248
You have no power to keep me, old man.

17:23.208 --> 17:28.838
You must understand by now
this planet is not my destiny.

17:29.214 --> 17:33.009
What you will do
will destroy all that is good.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.303
I beg you!

17:35.971 --> 17:39.015
Restrain yourself and stay!

17:39.266 --> 17:40.600
I cannot.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.312
And then it shall be.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.148
I love you, my son.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.441
Do you?

17:48.484 --> 17:49.525
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)

17:49.610 --> 17:50.985
(WHOOSHING)

17:51.070 --> 17:52.236
(GROANING)

18:00.079 --> 18:01.496
(BOTH GROAN)

18:07.586 --> 18:09.003
What?

18:09.046 --> 18:10.421
(LAUGHING)

18:10.506 --> 18:12.882
You're going to kill me now?

18:13.342 --> 18:16.552
I held hope that
you could resist the dark side,

18:17.679 --> 18:19.555
but I see now,

18:20.349 --> 18:23.184
there is no going back.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.188
-Father. No!
-(GROANS)

18:27.898 --> 18:33.194
What have you done?
It did not have to be this way!

18:33.237 --> 18:36.697
Yes, my child, it did.

18:37.866 --> 18:43.538
You and I are tied together
and your strength runs through me.

18:45.040 --> 18:49.043
This way, I take your power.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.588
Please, don't die.

18:54.383 --> 18:58.427
I always knew there was good in you.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.223
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)

19:02.266 --> 19:03.558
(GROANS)

19:09.231 --> 19:12.233
And so you have betrayed me, Father.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.570
(GROANING)

19:23.453 --> 19:24.912
It is done.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.416
And now I die,

19:29.793 --> 19:31.460
my heart broken,

19:32.504 --> 19:36.799
but knowing the role you will play.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.468
And what is that?

19:39.970 --> 19:43.848
You are the chosen one.

19:44.641 --> 19:48.269
You have brought balance to this world.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.773
Stay on this path,

19:52.858 --> 19:57.153
and you will do it again for the galaxy.

19:58.113 --> 20:03.284
But beware, your heart...

20:54.544 --> 20:56.712
General Skywalker, come in!

20:59.508 --> 21:01.884
We read you, Rex. Can you hear me?

21:02.010 --> 21:04.720
Yes sir, standing by. We were worried.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.515
You were off the scopes
there for a moment.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.100
A moment? (CHUCKLES)

21:09.184 --> 21:10.935
We've been gone
more than a moment, Rex.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.563
Sir, I don't understand.
You'll need to explain.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.109
(SIGHS) You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.736
We're coming in now.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.074
