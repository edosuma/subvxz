¶<i> It seems today</i>

00:04.672 --> 00:08.007

00:08.084 --> 00:11.677

00:11.754 --> 00:14.514

00:14.590 --> 00:18.008

00:33.726 --> 00:36.110
All right. Empty school.

00:36.186 --> 00:39.154
Time to <i> Shining</i> my way
through the halls.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.877
Principal Shepherd,
where is everyone?!

00:53.888 --> 00:56.839
Principal Shepherd's not here,

00:56.915 --> 00:58.716
Miss Griffin.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.467
Why are you talking like that?

01:00.544 --> 01:01.802
Sorry. That was Tony,

01:01.879 --> 01:03.387
the little boy
who lives in my mouth.

01:03.398 --> 01:04.888
Why are you here?
It's skip day.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.016
It's skip day?
Nobody told me.

01:07.092 --> 01:10.978
She's unpopular
and unattractive.

01:11.055 --> 01:12.530
Tony!

01:16.894 --> 01:19.987
Hello?! Chris?

01:20.064 --> 01:22.323
Did you know it was skip day?

01:22.399 --> 01:24.709
Mom? Dad?

01:30.449 --> 01:31.757
Hello?

01:31.834 --> 01:33.208
<i> Mom? Where are you guys?</i>

01:33.285 --> 01:34.594
Who is this?

01:34.670 --> 01:36.262
<i> It's Meg.</i>
<i> Where is everyone?</i>

01:36.339 --> 01:39.098
Well, this can't be Meg.
She's with us here at the pier.

01:39.175 --> 01:41.100
-Who is that?
-Someone who says she's Meg.

01:41.177 --> 01:43.052
Give me that.

01:43.128 --> 01:45.888
Okay,<i> Meg,</i> if this is you,
what's your birthday?

01:45.964 --> 01:47.431
<i> March 23.</i>

01:47.442 --> 01:49.183
I have no idea
if that's correct.

01:49.259 --> 01:50.643
Good day, sir.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.445
Sorry about that, everyone.

01:52.521 --> 01:55.573
Now let's get back to the fair
and enjoy our March 23.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.912
The usual, please.

02:09.988 --> 02:12.039
Here ya are--
ladies' seven on the left,

02:12.116 --> 02:13.957
and men's 11 on the right.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.292
I just need a license.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.919
Thanks.

02:16.995 --> 02:19.889
Oh! And happy birthday!

02:32.344 --> 02:34.820
Yes!

02:44.832 --> 02:47.958
We have not updated those.

02:51.414 --> 02:52.746
<i> Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

02:52.823 --> 02:55.165
<i> Coming up,</i>
<i> I find even more sand</i>

02:55.176 --> 02:58.344
<i> on my body from a beach toilet</i>
<i> I used a week ago.</i>

02:58.421 --> 03:01.004
<i> But first,</i>
<i> tragedy strikes close to home,</i>

03:01.015 --> 03:03.298
<i> as a car crash near</i>
<i> my apartment claims the life</i>

03:03.375 --> 03:04.850
<i> of a local teen girl.</i>

03:04.927 --> 03:06.760
<i> The victim's identity</i>
<i> is being withheld</i>

03:06.837 --> 03:09.012
<i> pending notification</i>
<i> of the family.</i>

03:10.674 --> 03:12.692
Hey, buddy.

03:12.768 --> 03:15.477
What brings you around at this
late hour with your uniform on

03:15.554 --> 03:17.938
and your hat held mournfully
against your chest?

03:18.015 --> 03:21.534
Peter, Lois,
it pains me above the waist

03:21.610 --> 03:23.277
to tell you that Meg is dead.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.862
-What?!
-What are you talking about?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.038
Meg's right here.

03:29.860 --> 03:32.453
You know, it's weird that didn't
happen on the pier all day.

03:32.529 --> 03:33.954
Or when we rented
that convertible.

03:34.031 --> 03:35.715
How did this happen?!

03:35.791 --> 03:38.292
She got in a car wreck, and
was burned beyond recognition,

03:38.368 --> 03:40.886
and I leveled up on Fortnite
this weekend,

03:40.963 --> 03:43.547
but you probably only care
about the first two things.

03:43.558 --> 03:46.175
Oh, dear God, no!

03:46.251 --> 03:48.936
All we found was Meg's
driver's license at the scene.

03:51.307 --> 03:54.808
It had her Quiznos punch card
stuck to the back.

03:54.885 --> 03:58.020
Your little angel was
one stamp away from a free sub,

03:58.096 --> 04:00.898
which only adds
to this horrific tragedy.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.232
It's actually pretty impressive,

04:02.243 --> 04:05.411
because the card was only issued
three days ago.

04:05.488 --> 04:08.030
Usually one of the guys would
swipe a thing like this,

04:08.106 --> 04:10.699
use it on the way home,
but I snagged it for ya.

04:10.776 --> 04:12.868
Thought Meg's family ought
to be the ones

04:12.945 --> 04:14.912
to enjoy the free sandwich.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.873
Again, I'm very sorry.

04:21.620 --> 04:22.920
<i> Oh, hang on.</i>

04:22.930 --> 04:24.764
<i> Oh, they told the family?</i>
<i> Great!</i>

04:24.840 --> 04:27.674
<i> The girl killed near</i>
<i> my apartment was Meg Griffin.</i>

04:27.751 --> 04:29.843
What? I'm not dead!

04:29.920 --> 04:31.595
<i> She was burned</i>
<i> beyond recognition</i>

04:31.606 --> 04:33.514
<i> but identified</i>
<i> by her driver's license.</i>

04:33.590 --> 04:35.608
<i> 156 pounds.</i>

04:35.684 --> 04:36.892
<i> Yikes.</i>

04:36.969 --> 04:40.354
Wait. Did you give my ID
to the wrong girl?

04:40.430 --> 04:44.116
Sorry. Them shoe spray fumes
made me all goofy in my head.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.955
I'm still sober.
This ain't cheatin'!

04:50.032 --> 04:51.698
Oh, this is me being sober!

04:53.294 --> 04:55.202
So I guess I'm dead.

04:55.279 --> 04:57.296
And no one cares.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.916
<i> Again, for those of you</i>

05:00.993 --> 05:03.052
<i> in a new scene:</i>
<i> Meg Griffin dead.</i>

05:40.341 --> 05:42.165
Lois,
can you believe these seats?

05:42.176 --> 05:44.126
Front row!

05:44.202 --> 05:47.012
I hope the priest pulls me up
on stage and dances with me.

05:47.089 --> 05:50.465
When I was hastily relocated
to this parish a week ago,

05:50.542 --> 05:52.685
the last thing
I thought I'd have to do is

05:52.761 --> 05:55.679
stand before you
on such a sad occasion.

05:55.690 --> 05:57.189
A family losing a child is like

05:57.266 --> 05:59.692
a Trivial Pursuit wheel
losing a pie piece.

05:59.768 --> 06:02.644
And you have to keep reminding
everyone playing the game,

06:02.721 --> 06:06.023
"Don't forget. I already got
'Entertainment'." What a pain.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.909
Your first speaker--
Principal Shepherd.

06:10.279 --> 06:12.613
Meg Griffin was an honest man,

06:12.689 --> 06:14.990
a kind man,
a man who knew how...

06:16.711 --> 06:17.784
Oh, my stars!

06:17.861 --> 06:19.661
I have nothing.

06:19.738 --> 06:21.714
Kind of feel bad.
There's nobody here.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.624
I know.<i> We're</i> not even here.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.888
This was the right decision.

06:28.964 --> 06:31.724
Hey, Chris, I'm super sorry
your sister is dead.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.176
Mwah.

06:34.252 --> 06:36.511
If there's anything
we can do to help you

06:36.588 --> 06:38.063
during your time of need...

06:38.140 --> 06:39.565
-Stamps.
-What?

06:39.642 --> 06:41.183
Stamps. I need stamps.

06:41.259 --> 06:42.943
Okay, you got it.

06:44.888 --> 06:47.740
Wow. Are girls coming on to me
because my sister died?

06:47.816 --> 06:49.900
Cool!

06:49.911 --> 06:52.244
<i> God, I wish</i>
<i> it was Joe in that box.</i>

06:52.321 --> 06:53.737
I do, too, Bon.

06:53.748 --> 06:55.739
Oh. Did I say that out loud?

06:55.750 --> 06:58.083
No, but at this point,
I know what you're thinking.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.960
It'll be soon, babe.

07:03.573 --> 07:05.248
Unbelievable.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.000
There's hardly anyone here.

07:07.077 --> 07:08.835
Ugh. Well, that's it.

07:08.912 --> 07:11.380
I'm off to a new town
to start a new life.

07:11.456 --> 07:13.432
Ooh. Sorry.

07:13.509 --> 07:15.392
Don't you know what a rosary
on a doorknob means?!

07:30.526 --> 07:34.069
Siri, play "Kiss From a Rose"
by Seal.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.249
I hope everyone enjoys
tonight's dinner.

07:48.877 --> 07:50.961
It... it was Meg's favorite.

07:52.789 --> 07:54.923
There, there, Lois.
Stop your crying.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.925
Stop it.

07:57.002 --> 07:58.885
Please stop. Stop.

07:58.962 --> 08:01.972
Stop it. Stop crying.

08:01.983 --> 08:03.148
Stop crying.

08:03.225 --> 08:05.726
Stop crying. Stop.

08:05.802 --> 08:07.820
Before we eat,

08:07.896 --> 08:09.905
would anyone like
to say something about Meg?

08:12.476 --> 08:15.819
Okay, I feel all of you
looking at me, so here goes.

08:15.830 --> 08:18.113
Meg, wherever you are,

08:18.190 --> 08:20.499
I hope that you're with Bubba,
and I want you to know

08:20.576 --> 08:22.492
that Lieutenant Dan
is walking around...

08:22.503 --> 08:23.827
Is this from <i> Forrest Gump?</i>

08:23.838 --> 08:26.246
I miss you, Meg.

08:26.323 --> 08:27.831
Stop it, Brian.

08:27.842 --> 08:29.082
Stop your crying.

08:29.159 --> 08:30.625
Stop it.

08:30.702 --> 08:31.752
Please stop.

08:31.828 --> 08:33.846
Stop. Stop it.

08:33.922 --> 08:36.631
Stop crying.
Stop crying.

08:36.707 --> 08:39.301
Stop crying. Stop.

08:39.376 --> 08:42.846
Stewie, is there anything
you'd like to say?

08:42.857 --> 08:45.974
Yeah. We're gonna save a lot
of money on toilet paper.

08:46.051 --> 08:47.768
Ever see her wipe?

08:47.844 --> 08:49.686
She'd wrap up both hands
like oven mitts

08:49.697 --> 08:52.606
and act like she was cleaning
out a pot of burnt chili.

08:52.682 --> 08:56.359
Anyway, that's all
I care to say about Meg.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.537
Maybe we should just have
a moment of silence

08:58.614 --> 09:00.489
as we hear the guy
down the street

09:00.565 --> 09:01.865
scream at his barking dog.

09:03.652 --> 09:05.660
Damn it, Rufus, shut up!

09:05.737 --> 09:07.370
Will you shut up?!

09:07.381 --> 09:10.090
Get in the house!
Get in the house!

09:13.370 --> 09:17.389
¶<i> This time things are gonna</i>
<i> work out fine</i> ¶

09:17.466 --> 09:20.675
¶<i> This time will be better</i>
<i> than previous times</i> ¶

09:20.752 --> 09:23.553
¶<i> This time is</i>
<i> markedly different</i> ¶

09:23.564 --> 09:27.974
¶<i> Than the times</i>

09:28.051 --> 09:31.895
¶<i> This time is gonna be</i>
<i> so much more!</i> ¶

09:33.932 --> 09:36.075
¶<i> Or maybe it's not.</i> ¶

09:40.155 --> 09:42.572
Hi, new neighbor.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.907
I just thought
I'd come by and see

09:43.918 --> 09:45.700
if I could borrow a cup
of tampons.

09:45.777 --> 09:48.703
Sure. Just bring 'em back
when you're done. No rush.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.080
Thanks. My name's not important.

09:50.091 --> 09:51.581
What's yours?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.875
Um... my name?

09:53.952 --> 09:55.344
My name is...

09:57.789 --> 09:59.256
Hallway.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.924
Natalie Hallway.

10:00.935 --> 10:02.884
Nice to meet you, Natalie.

10:02.961 --> 10:05.011
You want to join us on the roof
and sit under string lights?

10:05.088 --> 10:06.513
That sounds great!

10:06.590 --> 10:08.431
I'll bring my hemorrhoid donut
to sit on.

10:10.018 --> 10:11.434
Great joke, Natalie Hallway!

10:11.445 --> 10:13.353
Yes. It is a joke.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.522
Because Natalie Hallway
doesn't need

10:15.599 --> 10:17.783
to sit on a hemorrhoid donut.

10:21.813 --> 10:24.206
To Natalie Hallway,
our new friend.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.335
Natalie, sit down.
Tell us about yourself.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.581
<i> Yow...!</i>

10:32.657 --> 10:34.007
What a view!

10:38.380 --> 10:40.630
You know, Stewie,
when Meg was little,

10:40.641 --> 10:43.934
we used to love to make
Christmas cookies together.

10:45.980 --> 10:48.647
Are... are those dongs?

10:48.724 --> 10:50.932
My God, from October to January

10:51.009 --> 10:52.642
I don't come up for air.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.061
All those families enjoying
their Christmas dongs.

10:55.138 --> 10:57.606
Could we get some of your
cookies for our wedding?

10:57.682 --> 10:59.316
Get out of here!
This is a family bakery!

10:59.326 --> 11:00.942
I'm a Christian!

11:01.019 --> 11:02.828
In the case of <i> Kent and Bradley</i>

11:02.905 --> 11:05.071
<i> v. Holiday Dongs,</i>

11:05.148 --> 11:08.667
the court rules that you
must give us the recipe.

11:08.744 --> 11:10.660
Oh!

11:10.671 --> 11:12.337
<i> Under court order,</i>
<i> Stewie went on</i>

11:12.414 --> 11:14.456
<i> to make baked goods</i>
<i> for the gay wedding.</i>

11:14.532 --> 11:16.833
<i> And because of that,</i>
<i> he did not get into heaven,</i>

11:16.844 --> 11:19.252
<i> just like they've</i>
<i> always been saying.</i>

11:25.761 --> 11:27.636
Chris, be in my selfie!

11:27.712 --> 11:29.804
I want to make
Meg's death about me.

11:31.192 --> 11:32.849
Hey, Chris, I couldn't
help but notice

11:32.860 --> 11:34.193
how much attention
you're getting.

11:34.269 --> 11:35.435
Want to high-five hug?

11:35.512 --> 11:37.979
Hell yes.

11:38.056 --> 11:39.689
Hang in there, brotha.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.025
I will,<i> brother.</i>

11:42.036 --> 11:44.703
Chris, here are the keys
to the drivers ed car

11:44.780 --> 11:46.538
to use anytime you want.

11:46.615 --> 11:49.491
-Wow, cool.
-See, everyone?

11:49.567 --> 11:52.702
If I were using the drivers ed
car for my real car,

11:52.713 --> 11:54.379
I wouldn't have
given him the keys.

11:54.456 --> 11:56.215
That would be a psycho move.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.884
I wouldn't have a ride home.

11:58.961 --> 12:01.386
Chris, if you're heading home,
can I get a ride?

12:17.905 --> 12:19.062
-Yeah!
-Go, Natalie!

12:19.073 --> 12:20.563
Wow, Natalie Hallway,

12:20.574 --> 12:22.691
how did you get
so good at bowling?

12:22.767 --> 12:23.909
Oh, I used to play a lot

12:23.986 --> 12:26.912
back in Qua... rea.

12:26.989 --> 12:28.405
Wow, you lived in Korea?

12:28.415 --> 12:29.823
Yep.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.658
When I was with the embassy.

12:31.735 --> 12:33.743
So was that before
or after you were

12:33.754 --> 12:35.704
one of the first black women
to do math for NASA?

12:35.780 --> 12:37.580
Yes.

12:37.591 --> 12:41.418
Wow, your parents must be
so proud of you.

12:55.851 --> 12:57.276
Hey, Griffin,
I heard you scored

12:57.352 --> 12:59.185
with the girls'
basketball team yesterday.

12:59.262 --> 13:01.938
Yep, 12 points
and eight rebounds.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.606
Aw, Griffin, you're the man.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.284
I got an extra orange at lunch.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.202
-You want it?
-Yeah!

13:08.789 --> 13:10.947
Life is pretty sweet.

13:12.293 --> 13:13.575
Hello?

13:13.651 --> 13:14.576
Hey, Chris.

13:14.652 --> 13:15.702
Meg?!

13:15.779 --> 13:17.579
Are you alive?

13:17.655 --> 13:18.872
Yes. I'll explain everything.

13:18.948 --> 13:20.540
Can you come meet me?

13:20.617 --> 13:22.709
Okay, still the cemetery?

13:22.786 --> 13:23.969
Alive?!

13:24.046 --> 13:25.712
Chris, you already
know that part.

13:25.789 --> 13:27.030
Oh, right.

13:27.032 --> 13:29.799
So you suddenly got sick
of your new, great life?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.051
No, Chris.

13:31.127 --> 13:33.470
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

13:33.480 --> 13:34.721
I missed Mom.

13:34.798 --> 13:36.473
I missed you.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.650
I missed the whole family.

13:38.727 --> 13:40.643
I'm glad you're alive,
but you should know

13:40.654 --> 13:42.103
things are different now.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.822
-Dad finally got a Peloton?
-Yeah.

13:43.899 --> 13:45.732
-Is he using it?
-No.

13:45.809 --> 13:47.150
He mumbled something
about the Wi-Fi,

13:47.161 --> 13:48.902
then ate a whole chicken
on the couch,

13:48.978 --> 13:50.820
-but there's something else.
-What is it?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.665
Let's talk about it in the van.

13:53.742 --> 13:54.666
Chris?!

13:54.743 --> 13:56.785
What are you doing?!
Let me out!

13:56.861 --> 13:59.662
Sorry, Meg, but I can't
let you come home just yet.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.840
I'm too popular now.

14:03.827 --> 14:05.460
-What's the holdup?
-What?

14:05.537 --> 14:06.669
I slapped the van twice.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.129
Yeah, what was that?

14:08.206 --> 14:09.798
I thought something
flew into the van.

14:09.874 --> 14:11.683
No, that's, like,
the universal signal

14:11.760 --> 14:13.176
for "move it out."

14:13.187 --> 14:14.636
I never heard that.

14:14.712 --> 14:16.179
And I drive vans all the time.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.190
Well, then how do you know
when it's time to head out?

14:18.266 --> 14:20.934
Somebody yells out
"okay" or "all right."

14:21.010 --> 14:22.852
Every so often it's "yep."

14:22.863 --> 14:25.522
Well, okay, you're good to go.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.024
All right.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.109
Ow! Ow!

14:29.185 --> 14:30.777
What are you doing?!

14:30.854 --> 14:32.704
Sorry, I got
distracted by all this

14:32.781 --> 14:34.910
whappin' the side
of the van business.

14:44.626 --> 14:47.219
Hello? Hello?

14:47.295 --> 14:49.879
Where is everyone?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.674
Damn it, Chris, I don't care
that you're popular now.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.843
Let me out of here!

14:54.919 --> 14:57.011
Well, at least
I still have my music.

14:57.088 --> 15:00.056
Siri, play Seals and Croft.

15:00.067 --> 15:04.403
¶<i> Darling if you want me</i>
<i> to be...</i> ¶

15:06.097 --> 15:10.075
¶<i> Get closer to me.</i> ¶

15:12.770 --> 15:14.696
Good morning, students.

15:14.772 --> 15:17.082
We are gathered here
for two reasons today.

15:17.159 --> 15:19.701
One, to mourn the loss
of Meg Griffin.

15:19.777 --> 15:22.370
And two, to find the owner
of this X-Men water bottle

15:22.447 --> 15:24.164
someone left in wood shop--
does anyone recognize it?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.415
I'll take it!

15:25.426 --> 15:28.084
That's not what I asked.
Anyone?

15:28.095 --> 15:29.761
I'm not gonna tell you
which character's on it,

15:29.838 --> 15:31.504
you have to be able
to tell <i> me</i> the character.

15:31.581 --> 15:32.839
Wolverine!

15:32.916 --> 15:34.382
-Are you guessing?
-Am I right?

15:34.459 --> 15:36.009
All right,
we'll handle this after.

15:36.085 --> 15:39.438
But now, here to help you mourn,
an artist who specializes

15:39.514 --> 15:41.773
in sensitive music
to do finger stuff to,

15:41.850 --> 15:44.517
Mr. John Mayer!

15:44.594 --> 15:45.685
It's good to be here.

15:45.762 --> 15:46.728
I love high school!

15:46.804 --> 15:47.896
Who are you?

15:47.972 --> 15:49.522
I was born in 2003!

15:49.599 --> 15:51.441
Then I'm probably your father.

15:51.452 --> 15:53.860
Ooh, pwned!

15:53.937 --> 15:56.955
Whoa, looks like the school
really is missing Meg.

15:57.032 --> 15:58.907
Chris, Brian,
would you help Peter?

15:58.983 --> 16:00.950
He's one of those
"has to be supported

16:00.961 --> 16:02.586
by both elbows" mourners.

16:04.989 --> 16:08.049
I'm gonna need three seats
for my elbow supporters.

16:10.328 --> 16:12.137
Stewie, you look depressed.

16:12.214 --> 16:13.755
You still upset about Meg?

16:13.831 --> 16:15.423
No, it's just this gym is sad.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.259
If you haven't won
a championship since 1982,

16:18.336 --> 16:20.720
just take the banner down.

16:25.677 --> 16:27.435
Well, Meg,

16:27.512 --> 16:30.605
looks like you really
are dead this time.

16:30.682 --> 16:33.483
They say your life flashes
before your eyes when you die.

16:33.494 --> 16:35.985
I wonder what I'll see.

16:37.814 --> 16:38.988
Oh, yeah!

16:38.999 --> 16:40.156
Over!

16:40.167 --> 16:41.491
I'm a tomato.

16:43.245 --> 16:44.410
<i> I'm not in any of these!</i>

16:44.487 --> 16:45.578
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:45.655 --> 16:47.163
Mr. Conway Twitty.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.340
Oh, come on!

16:48.416 --> 16:49.916
I was in the <i> Kingsman</i> fight!

16:49.993 --> 16:51.209
That could've been in there.

16:51.286 --> 16:52.502
I can do stuff.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.254
I-I can be a part
of a comedy team!

16:54.330 --> 16:56.756
Look, hey, Chris,
who's on first?

16:56.833 --> 16:59.842
A baseball player.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.853
Well, that's it.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.688
I'm gonna show them.

17:03.765 --> 17:05.357
I'm gonna live.

17:05.433 --> 17:07.642
I'm getting out of here.

17:07.719 --> 17:09.861
Now let's see,
if I whap my forehead

17:09.938 --> 17:11.863
against this cement floor
enough times,

17:11.940 --> 17:14.440
I think I can
create a blood luge

17:14.517 --> 17:16.367
to slide myself out on.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.987
This... this...

17:19.063 --> 17:21.039
can be in the highlight...

17:21.116 --> 17:23.083
video!

17:36.873 --> 17:37.964
Wow, thank you, John Mayer.

17:38.041 --> 17:39.674
Wasn't he terrific?

17:39.751 --> 17:41.676
I think we can all agree
that John is entitled

17:41.753 --> 17:44.721
to take whichever student he
wishes home with him tonight.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.849
And finally, the Quiznos

17:47.925 --> 17:49.568
across the street
has graciously

17:49.644 --> 17:51.853
taken out a full page ad
in the yearbook

17:51.929 --> 17:54.322
that will feature
a dedication page to Meg.

17:56.392 --> 17:58.067
Quiznos, go ahead and stand up.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.579
Come on, in the back,
you guys have been great.

18:10.615 --> 18:12.081
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, everyone!

18:12.092 --> 18:13.916
He's proposing right here!

18:13.927 --> 18:14.917
Right in front of everyone!

18:14.928 --> 18:16.544
Oh, she's so lucky!

18:16.621 --> 18:17.920
Oh, my God!

18:20.008 --> 18:22.934
I'm alive! I'm alive!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.428
Meg!

18:25.463 --> 18:26.771
Those are dark-soled shoes.

18:26.848 --> 18:29.766
She's wearing dark-soled shoes
on the gym floor!

18:29.776 --> 18:31.851
Sneakers only in the gym, guys.

18:31.928 --> 18:33.061
Oh, my God, Meg!

18:33.137 --> 18:34.937
I'm so glad you're alive!

18:34.948 --> 18:37.023
What happened?

18:37.100 --> 18:38.658
He did this!

18:40.311 --> 18:42.403
Are you saying Chris
saved your life?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.697
This calls for a celebration.

18:44.774 --> 18:46.699
All right,
everyone throw confetti

18:46.776 --> 18:48.576
and ruin the janitor's weekend.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.957
Hey, I'm not gonna
make it this weekend.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.960
Oh, but you're gonna miss
the big janitor dance!

18:57.971 --> 19:00.797
This is our last chance to get
laid before Janitor College!

19:00.807 --> 19:02.924
You think I don't know that?!

19:03.000 --> 19:06.478
No! Chris kidnapped me
so he could stay popular!

19:06.554 --> 19:08.971
What? Chris would never do that.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.649
Chris?

19:10.725 --> 19:12.525
It's true, Mom.

19:15.897 --> 19:17.939
I owe my sister an apology.

19:18.015 --> 19:19.899
I shouldn't have treated her
the way I did.

19:19.976 --> 19:22.235
And I think
if Meg were here today,

19:22.311 --> 19:24.278
she'd be the first one to agree.

19:24.355 --> 19:25.571
I am here!

19:25.648 --> 19:26.906
I'm right here!

19:26.983 --> 19:28.574
Anyway, Meg, wherever you are,

19:28.651 --> 19:29.951
I'm sorry.

19:32.155 --> 19:34.839
Damn it, I'm giving a speech!
I want to tell you--

19:34.916 --> 19:37.667
Very loud chant!
Very loud chant!

19:37.678 --> 19:40.294
Very loud chant! Very loud
chant!

19:42.424 --> 19:44.841
Oh, my God, Meg,
I'm so glad you're back.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.342
We love you, honey.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.302
I love you, too, Mom.

19:48.379 --> 19:50.689
Yeah, Meg, I'm just really glad
this whole ordeal is over.

19:50.765 --> 19:52.473
<i>Glad this whole ordeal is what?</i>

19:52.550 --> 19:53.975
<i>Over.</i>

19:54.051 --> 19:55.235
Come on!

20:02.277 --> 20:03.943
I'm sorry I faked
my own death, Mom.

20:04.020 --> 20:05.319
It's okay, Meg.

20:05.396 --> 20:06.705
Actually, I should've known.

20:06.781 --> 20:08.873
Faking stuff is part
of being a woman.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.116
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

20:10.193 --> 20:11.826
Women fake a lot of things.

20:11.903 --> 20:14.662
You faked your death,
I fake orgasms and being

20:14.739 --> 20:17.540
impressed by my husband's
accomplishments at work.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.500
Hey, Lois, guess
who got to erase

20:19.577 --> 20:21.544
the white board
in a meeting today?

20:21.596 --> 20:22.879
Oh, my!

20:22.889 --> 20:24.889
I think someone's earned himself

20:24.966 --> 20:27.633
Mama Lois' famous
egg salad, huh?

20:27.710 --> 20:29.218
Oh, yum!

20:29.229 --> 20:31.345
Oh, today just keeps getting
better and better!

20:31.422 --> 20:33.931
Dad, I thought you hated
Mom's egg salad.

20:34.008 --> 20:36.642
Chris, part of being a man
is faking things.

20:36.719 --> 20:39.979
Like orgasms or pretending
to like your wife's egg salad.

20:40.056 --> 20:42.907
And anyway, I give it to that
raccoon outside who likes me.

20:44.769 --> 20:46.319
I thought you hated that guy.

20:46.395 --> 20:49.572
Part of being a raccoon
is faking things.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.916
Like orgasms
or pretending to like people

20:51.993 --> 20:53.868
who give you egg salad.

20:53.945 --> 20:55.369
Oh, Peter!

20:55.446 --> 20:56.921
Oh, Lois!

20:56.998 --> 20:59.507
Oh, other raccoon!
