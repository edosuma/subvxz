00:34.234 --> 00:35.701
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, frank!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.136
- Yay!

00:37.138 --> 00:38.437
- You want to cut
the cake, frank?

00:38.439 --> 00:39.772
- Just a minute.
Let me loosen up here.

00:39.774 --> 00:41.673
- No, don't unbuckle those.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.575
Go put on your elastic pants.

00:43.577 --> 00:44.576
- I don't want to.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.477
- Go, go, go.
Come on.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.212
- All right.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.181
My house, my pants,

00:49.183 --> 00:51.116
My birthday.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.653
- Okay, let's get
the presents.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.090
- What are you talking about?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.391
- Presents?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.160
You told me we weren't
getting him a present.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.161
- I--he hates presents.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.529
Here, hold this.
- Oh.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.164
- Robert, what's going on?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.765
We stopped getting him
presents.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.735
- Well, it is
his 65th birthday, raymond.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.571
You didn't get him a present?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.473
- I got him a card,

01:14.475 --> 01:16.108
A funny card.

01:16.110 --> 01:20.679
- So no present from you.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.314
- Well...

01:22.316 --> 01:23.816
The kids made stuff.

01:23.818 --> 01:26.452
- But nothing from you.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.087
- No.

01:28.089 --> 01:31.256
- Dad, you coming down,
or what?

01:33.593 --> 01:35.260
- Hurry up, knit something.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.595
- I'm gonna stay here
with the kids

01:36.597 --> 01:37.796
And help them
with their presents.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.831
- Oh, sure.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.633
Attach yourself to them.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.168
- You all ready?

01:43.170 --> 01:44.436
- All right.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.639
Ice cream and cake time.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.179
- Actually, dad,

01:54.181 --> 01:56.381
First we have
a little presentation.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.182
- [groans]

01:57.184 --> 01:58.484
- Here.

01:58.486 --> 02:02.354
Happy birthday, frank.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.389
- Is this a gag?

02:04.391 --> 02:05.591
- No, no.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.426
Some of us
got you presents.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.161
- Hey-hey.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.729
Bring 'em on!

02:10.731 --> 02:12.331
- Ray, do you want the card?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.566
- Yeah, I want to put
20 bucks in it.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.767
Give me 20 bucks.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.636
- The envelope's
already sealed.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.872
- Damn!

02:19.874 --> 02:22.774
- Oh, a sweater.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.444
Didn't you buy me
a sweater once already?

02:25.446 --> 02:27.379
- But you didn't wear
that one.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.915
- So why did you buy me
another one?

02:31.384 --> 02:34.253
- It's a beautiful sweater,
marie.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.922
- I'm probably
allergic to this.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.290
- See, ma?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.691
I don't know
why you keep trying.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.660
You're just gonna have to
return it like always.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.629
- Uh-uh.
Not this year.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.297
It's a final-sale item.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.298
[chuckles]

02:46.300 --> 02:49.168
No refunds and no exchanges.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.370
- That's what her parents
said when we got married.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.338
[chuckles]

02:53.340 --> 02:55.340
I do like the buttons.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.242
- Oh, hey.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.243
- Ooh, nice buttons.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.545
- Okay, ma, cake.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.546
How about it? Let's go.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.613
- Oh, wait, wait.
No, no.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.582
We got more presents.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.417
Dad, I think you're really
gonna like what I got you.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.785
- Oh.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.387
- Ah, card, card--
there's a card, too.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.256
- Okay.

03:11.258 --> 03:12.658
Hey!

03:12.660 --> 03:16.528
The little kid
with the spaghetti on his head.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.664
Look at him.

03:18.666 --> 03:22.501
[laughing]

03:22.503 --> 03:24.570
- Remember when you
did that to me?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.637
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.573
- He did it to me.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.574
- He did it
to me.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.574
- He can't even
reach your head.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.843
- He did it with cereal.
What are you talking about?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.445
- That's not right
we were watching the--

03:33.447 --> 03:34.446
- Stop fighting!

03:34.448 --> 03:37.549
He did it to you both.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.618
- What the hell is this?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.453
- The remote boat.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.488
- A what?

03:43.490 --> 03:44.656
- A remote boat.
Look.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.391
See?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.594
You put your remote controls
right here.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.263
Then you can put
your "tv guide" right here.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.532
That way you can take it around
to any chair.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.267
Maybe I'll go over here,
I'll go over there.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.268
Right?

03:56.270 --> 03:57.268
And...

03:57.270 --> 04:01.940
You have a special compartment
for your soda.

04:01.942 --> 04:06.245
- Holy crap!

04:06.247 --> 04:08.013
- Oh, that is clever.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.881
- Yeah, that's
kind of great.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.650
- Why didn't I invent that?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.318
- Why?
Dad, please.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.587
It takes a team of technicians
and designers

04:15.589 --> 04:18.490
And skilled craftsmen
to produce this...

04:18.492 --> 04:22.427
Wood box.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.862
- Well, what'd you get him,
big shot?

04:25.632 --> 04:28.267
- It doesn't matter.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.535
Just because
it's my 65th birthday

04:30.537 --> 04:33.572
Doesn't mean I have to get
a gift from everyone.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.409
- Look, I got you something.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.578
- Oh?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.413
- Yeah, yeah.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.048
Yeah, it just hasn't
gotten here yet.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.816
- I see.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.886
So, when do you suppose
it will...

04:47.888 --> 04:50.622
Arrive?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.624
- Hey, it's not that fruit
of the month thing again, is it?

04:52.626 --> 04:53.725
- No, no.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.460
- Oh, that was the worst!

04:55.462 --> 04:56.862
- Okay.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.363
- They're still coming!

04:58.365 --> 05:00.499
We got grapefruit
out the wazoo!

05:00.501 --> 05:01.500
- You promised.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.834
You promised you'd stop them.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.069
- You're still
in the computer.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.370
It's gonna take
a couple months.

05:05.372 --> 05:06.338
- Dear god!

05:10.710 --> 05:12.644
- So, uh...

05:12.646 --> 05:16.014
What did you get me,
and how come it's not here yet?

05:16.016 --> 05:19.351
- Because
I-I special-ordered it.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.819
- I ordered the remote boat
from a catalog,

05:20.821 --> 05:23.588
And it got here on time.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.357
- I know.
I know. I know.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.591
This is bull.
This is bull.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.427
You order something
for somebody's birthday,

05:28.429 --> 05:29.661
It should be here
by their birthday.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.063
Tell me about it.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.898
This is--I'm definitely
gonna call somebody,

05:32.900 --> 05:34.866
'cause this is total bull.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.643
Oh, what the hell
am I gonna get my dad now?

05:44.645 --> 05:47.079
He's never liked anything
I've ever gotten him.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.014
I thought I developed
the perfect system.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.351
I get him nothing.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.919
He seemed to like that.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.455
Now I got everybody
to go along with it,

05:56.457 --> 05:59.124
And all of a sudden,
he likes the remote boat.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.961
- Well, it is
his 65th birthday, ray.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.731
- Come on, you're the shopper;
help me.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.032
- [sighs]

06:07.034 --> 06:09.067
Why don't you take him
to a ball game?

06:09.069 --> 06:12.604
- Mm, no, it's got to be
something I ordered.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.139
That much we know.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.742
It's late
because I ordered it.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.076
Hey.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.379
Hey, if I got him
the universal remote,

06:20.381 --> 06:23.782
He wouldn't need
the remote boat.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.783
[chuckles]

06:24.785 --> 06:28.687
Robert.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.556
- What about the tv guide
and the soda?

06:31.558 --> 06:34.426
- Damn!

06:34.428 --> 06:36.027
- You know, when I want to get
my parents something,

06:36.029 --> 06:37.562
I just think about
what they like.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.631
What does he like?

06:39.633 --> 06:42.534
- He likes the number three
combo at wo-hop's,

06:42.536 --> 06:44.035
Pork fried rice
and egg roll.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.771
- Okay, so, get him that.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.773
Just light the egg roll

06:47.775 --> 06:50.675
And tell him it's one of those
hilarious trick candles.

06:50.677 --> 06:51.910
He'll love it.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.078
Good night.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.146
[chuckles]

06:59.519 --> 07:00.852
- Hey, you know
what I'm thinking?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.053
- Hey, what?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.955
- When we go to wo-hop's,

07:03.957 --> 07:07.192
He always takes a table
by the tropical fish tank.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.994
He likes that.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.663
Maybe I'll get him a fish tank.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.166
- Yeah.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.167
You know, that's good.
- Yeah?

07:15.169 --> 07:16.168
- That really is good, ray.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.103
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.805
- Wait, wait, wait.

07:19.807 --> 07:23.909
Would I have had to order
an aquarium?

07:23.911 --> 07:25.677
Okay, that's important.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.914
It has to fit in with my lie.

07:28.916 --> 07:33.084
- Maybe you
special-ordered him a fish.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.154
- Special fish.
- Yeah.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.956
- I like that.
- Mm-hmm.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.759
- I like that.
- Good.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.462
- Somebody,
some scuba diver in fiji

07:43.464 --> 07:45.096
Is just combing
the coral reefs

07:45.098 --> 07:49.234
Looking for frank barone's
very special fish.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.569
That's it. That's it.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.738
That's our story.
- Good, ray, okay.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.874
- Now repeat it back to me.

08:00.980 --> 08:05.951
- Holy crap.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.119
- "holy crap."

08:08.121 --> 08:10.255
- It's beautiful, raymond.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.058
- It's huge.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.046
- They had smaller tanks,
you know,

08:35.048 --> 08:36.047
But I thought--

08:36.049 --> 08:39.117
- Hey, ally, look at my fish.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.520
- Wow!

08:41.522 --> 08:43.288
- I'm gonna call lee and stan.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.524
They should come over
and see this.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.159
- Hey, dad, you know that
civil war special's coming on.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.728
I got the boat.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.997
- Who needs tv?

08:51.999 --> 08:55.901
We got our own
"discovery" channel right here.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.903
- Oh, ray, he loves it.

08:57.905 --> 09:01.973
- [mimicking]
oh, ray, he loves it.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.242
- I liked your gift, too,
robert

09:04.244 --> 09:05.844
Oh.
- Come on, robert.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.713
It's not a competition here.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.550
[chuckling]

09:11.552 --> 09:12.884
- Can we name them?

09:12.886 --> 09:16.555
- Yeah, let's call
these two lee and stan,

09:16.557 --> 09:19.858
And that big one with its
mouth open we'll call marie.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.794
[laughter]

09:32.104 --> 09:34.839
- Hey, bubeleh.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.041
- Hey, ray.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.242
Listen, I got to hand it to you.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.711
That aquarium is a huge hit.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.046
- Hmm, yeah?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.814
- Oh, everybody loves it.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.116
I mean, your mom
can't stop talking about it,

09:45.118 --> 09:46.351
And the kids
are over there right now

09:46.353 --> 09:49.788
Trying to pet the fish.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.591
Your dad just sits there
and stares at it.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.693
He doesn't even
come over here anymore.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.860
It's a miracle.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.596
- [grunts]

10:00.366 --> 10:04.002
- Oh, doesn't it feel good
to give the perfect gift?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.137
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.372
Yeah, but...

10:07.374 --> 10:09.774
- But--but what,
ray?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.209
There's no "but" here.
- No, don't you see?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.111
I've set a precedent now.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.981
I got him
a tropical fish tank.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.949
Now every year, I got to get him
something bigger and better.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.317
- No, no, no.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.152
Nobody says you have to
keep topping yourself.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.821
- Yes.
Yes, you do.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.922
That's the way gifts are.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.790
You have to.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.226
You can't get him an aquarium
one year and the next year...

10:28.228 --> 10:31.129
Isotoners.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.031
- Your dad loves the gift.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.699
Just enjoy the moment.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.672
- I've had
no training for that.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.040
- The good news is,

10:42.042 --> 10:43.975
You don't have to worry
about this for a year.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.378
- Oh, no, you know nothing
about worry.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.313
It's not that I don't have to
worry for a year.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.182
It's that I have a year
to worry.

10:57.189 --> 11:00.825
- Oh, this is a nice picture
of a fish, michael.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.394
Oh, do you see this,
raymond?

11:02.396 --> 11:04.696
- Hey, yeah, yeah,
that's nice.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.997
- Isn't it?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.299
You know, the other night,
we ate dinner in here

11:08.301 --> 11:10.135
Just so we could
watch the fish?

11:10.137 --> 11:12.270
- Hmm, no kidding, huh?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.672
- Not tonight, though.

11:13.674 --> 11:17.108
We're having baked salmon.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.211
- Yay, that's great.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.713
All right, ally,
come on, let's go.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.714
It's time for dinner.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.382
- Where's stan?

11:24.384 --> 11:27.318
- Oh, uh, I-I-I...

11:27.320 --> 11:30.221
I think he's--he's hiding
in the treasure chest.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.224
- He's too big
for the treasure chest.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.994
- No, I-I-I think
he goes in there sometimes

11:35.996 --> 11:38.296
Just to--to get away
from the other fish.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.699
- He's not in the damn
treasure chest.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.935
He's dead.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.070
- What?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.037
- That's what fish do!

11:46.039 --> 11:47.372
They die!

11:47.374 --> 11:49.107
- Dad, I'll replace him
for you.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.075
- I don't want him replaced!

11:50.077 --> 11:51.843
Do me a favor, ray!

11:51.845 --> 11:53.912
Don't get me
any more presents!

12:03.022 --> 12:06.891
- Okay, one fish dies, but...

12:06.893 --> 12:09.994
A lot of 'em lived.

12:09.996 --> 12:13.765
- Ray, ally was upset
about stan the fish, too,

12:13.767 --> 12:17.135
But she managed
to get to sleep.

12:21.040 --> 12:26.277
- Maybe he had some weird bond
with that fish, you know?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.913
Like flipper.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.318
- All right.

12:35.287 --> 12:38.790
I don't think
it was the particular fish, ray.

12:38.792 --> 12:42.293
I think it was more
of a symbolic thing.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.795
- You mean, like...

12:46.365 --> 12:48.133
What do you mean?

12:55.307 --> 12:58.977
- [sighs]

12:58.979 --> 13:01.246
It's his 65th birthday,

13:01.248 --> 13:04.482
And then on top of that,
stan dies.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.317
You know, it's bound
to bring up the question

13:06.319 --> 13:09.154
Of his own mortality.

13:09.156 --> 13:13.491
- Okay, but it was
stan the fish.

13:16.362 --> 13:21.232
- Yes, ray,
that's the symbolic part!

13:25.971 --> 13:27.105
- I don't think that's it.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.106
- Why not?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.375
- My father isn't that deep.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.577
He doesn't make
those connections.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.946
He thinks the moral
of the adam and eve story

13:34.948 --> 13:38.116
Is don't eat
when you're naked.

13:52.298 --> 13:53.398
- No, ray.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.300
I think that
that's definitely it,

13:55.302 --> 13:58.870
And I think that your father
is hiding his feelings.

13:58.872 --> 13:59.938
It's normal.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.140
You know,
he's afraid of dying,

14:02.142 --> 14:04.075
And then you...

14:04.077 --> 14:07.011
Give him
the gift of death.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.019
- Hi.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.154
- Oh, hi, raymond.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.622
You want some breakfast?

14:17.624 --> 14:20.592
- No, no.
I want to talk to dad.

14:20.594 --> 14:21.960
Hey, where's the tv?

14:21.962 --> 14:23.862
- Your father moved it
into the kitchen.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.496
- The kitchen?

14:25.498 --> 14:28.633
- Yeah, didn't want to be
in the same room with the fish.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.436
You know, you never know when
another one of 'em's gonna go...

14:31.438 --> 14:32.604
[singing]
dee, dee, dee-dee

14:32.606 --> 14:35.440
[gagging]

14:41.080 --> 14:42.447
- So he's still upset.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.316
- He should be
this upset when I die.

14:49.421 --> 14:50.588
- Thanks, ma.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.257
That's perfect.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.158
- A television for the kitchen--

14:54.160 --> 14:55.493
That's what
I should have got him.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.527
Damn!

14:56.529 --> 14:58.930
Hey.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.532
- [grunts]

15:01.534 --> 15:03.534
- Dad, can you turn off
the television for a second?

15:03.536 --> 15:04.669
I want to talk to you.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.505
- I can hear ya.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.473
- Please?

15:11.644 --> 15:13.011
[button clicks]

15:16.181 --> 15:18.449
Okay...

15:18.451 --> 15:20.351
Uh, see...
The aquarium--

15:20.353 --> 15:22.020
- I don't want
to talk about that.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.187
- I know.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.089
I know.

15:31.196 --> 15:34.265
Look, it was a bad gift
to give you,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.267
And I want to apologize.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.369
- Okay.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.038
So, we done?

15:40.040 --> 15:43.041
- No. No.
No, no.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.643
See, I think maybe I understand

15:45.645 --> 15:47.979
Why you're so upset
about the dead fish.

15:47.981 --> 15:52.016
- I don't give a flying wallenda
about a dead fish.

15:52.018 --> 15:54.218
- Yeah.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.454
Yeah, I know.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.056
I know. I know.

15:58.058 --> 16:02.093
But I think maybe the fish
was a symbol.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.594
- Huh?

16:09.034 --> 16:11.302
- The fish--
the fish dying,

16:11.304 --> 16:15.673
I-I think maybe
made you think about...

16:15.675 --> 16:17.175
Not that it's gonna
happen anytime soon.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.209
I mean, everybody--

16:18.211 --> 16:20.345
Everybody thinks about this.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.714
It's--I think about it too.

16:22.716 --> 16:26.684
- What in sweet hell
are you talkin' about?

16:26.686 --> 16:29.620
- Look, I'm--

16:29.622 --> 16:32.090
I just--I didn't mean
for the gift to upset you.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.658
- Nice job!

16:33.660 --> 16:35.293
You know,
when that fish died,

16:35.295 --> 16:37.328
I went to al's aquarium
to see if they'd replace it.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.364
- I-I told you,
I'd replace it.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.733
- I don't want you
to replace it, okay?

16:41.735 --> 16:43.634
- Okay, okay, I understand.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.737
That's--that's more
of the symbol thing.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.705
You don't want me
to replace the fish

16:47.707 --> 16:49.774
Because you don't want me
to replace you

16:49.776 --> 16:52.143
When you, you know...

16:54.046 --> 16:56.414
When you're dead.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.052
- When I'm dead?

17:03.522 --> 17:07.025
What are you
bringing that up for?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.127
I don't want you
to replace the fish

17:09.129 --> 17:13.097
Because I found out
it costs 40 bucks!

17:13.099 --> 17:16.434
Who the hell
buys a $40 fish?

17:16.436 --> 17:19.670
Salmon costs $13.95 a pound,
and you can eat it!

17:26.512 --> 17:28.046
- That's what you're mad at.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.046
- Yeah, yeah!

17:29.048 --> 17:32.050
Then I find out the whole
fish tank cost 600 bucks!

17:32.052 --> 17:34.519
Where do you get off
spendin' that kind of money?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.687
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.558
- Happy?

17:40.560 --> 17:44.662
- Jeez-o-loo,
600 bucks on a box of water!

17:47.166 --> 17:48.533
- Come on, dad, what--

17:48.535 --> 17:50.802
I-I-I wanted to do
somethin' nice.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.370
- Nice?

17:52.372 --> 17:55.606
That's more than I paid
for my first car!

17:55.608 --> 17:57.675
Next year, why don't you
get me a coffee mug

17:57.677 --> 18:01.212
That says,
"I make more than you"?

18:01.214 --> 18:03.414
And if I want a fish tank,

18:03.416 --> 18:04.816
I'll get my own
damn fish tank!

18:04.818 --> 18:06.417
- I know you can, dad,

18:06.419 --> 18:10.221
But then it wouldn't be a gift.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.823
- You know what's a nice gift?

18:11.825 --> 18:13.424
I'll tell ya.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.494
One of those magnetic
coin holders for your car.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.230
$1.50 at any car wash.
- Come on.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.733
- That's a nice thing
for a son to give a father!

18:22.735 --> 18:23.868
- Dad, come on, I--

18:23.870 --> 18:25.703
Look, I make a good living.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.105
I can afford to buy you this.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.172
- I know!

18:28.174 --> 18:30.208
Okay?
I know!

18:31.710 --> 18:35.680
Look, how would you feel
if little geoffrey went out

18:35.682 --> 18:39.283
And got you
some big, expensive thing?

18:39.285 --> 18:43.754
- I'd wonder why michael
didn't get me something,

18:43.756 --> 18:46.190
But then I would feel proud.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.892
I'd feel proud that
one of my boys could do that.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.228
- You think
that's how you'd feel!

18:50.230 --> 18:53.564
- No, I would.
I would feel proud.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.733
So you don't
feel proud of me.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.335
- No, no, no, no.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.803
There's some of that.

19:01.406 --> 19:05.276
But then there's me.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.179
I still have
to feel about me.

19:10.449 --> 19:11.482
- Come on, dad.
What?

19:11.484 --> 19:15.319
You--you did all right.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.321
Didn't you do better
than your father?

19:17.323 --> 19:19.624
- Some contest.

19:23.695 --> 19:26.464
- Look, if it--

19:26.466 --> 19:27.899
If it makes you
feel any better,

19:27.901 --> 19:31.903
I wouldn't be where I am
without you.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.673
- Yeah, yeah.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.811
- So...

19:40.813 --> 19:42.513
Sorry for the gift.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.187
- It's all right.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.721
At least you tried.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.794
- So you weren't upset
about death at all.

19:56.796 --> 20:00.831
- Not until
you mentioned it.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.700
Thanks, though.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.971
- Oh, boy,

20:06.973 --> 20:09.307
Debra was way off on this one.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.917
- It's is a great tank.
- Yeah.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.919
- I've been wantin' to put
another one in the restaurant.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.221
Thanks a lot, ray.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.422
- Hmm.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.592
It's nice to be appreciated.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.993
- Well, dad,
at least you still have

20:28.995 --> 20:31.295
The good ol' remote boat.

20:31.297 --> 20:34.265
Where is it?

20:34.267 --> 20:36.801
- I needed
a coffin for stan.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.837
- You buried stan
in the remote boat?

20:39.839 --> 20:42.707
- Ally wanted a ceremony.

20:42.709 --> 20:46.744
You don't flush a $40 fish
down the toilet.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.745
- Wo-hop,

20:47.747 --> 20:50.314
Wait! Take some fruit!
