15:35.560 --> 15:37.391
l thought we were sleeping... Ramona.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.835
- What's happened?
- She must have the cordless.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.150
We've had a row. Adam's walked out.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.151
Ramona, get off the phone!

15:44.240 --> 15:46.151
Why would he just walk out?

15:46.240 --> 15:48.390
Because l told him l'm married.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.516
BOTH: Married?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.670
- Married?
- Yes, married.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.671
- Rachel's married.
- Married?

15:54.760 --> 15:56.671
Yes, married.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.034
ln name only.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.997
Bumstead?

16:00.080 --> 16:01.991
Well, l never used it.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.594
Well, you wouldn't, would you?

16:04.680 --> 16:08.832
Rachel, l've known you for six years.
You've never mentioned this.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.876
Believe me, l'd remember.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.951
Well, he broke my heart.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.996
Who wants to talk about it?

16:17.960 --> 16:20.269
l suppose l hoped it would just...

16:20.360 --> 16:22.271
go away.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.271
So...

16:24.360 --> 16:27.079
have you seen your husband since?

16:29.760 --> 16:33.355
He and Suzie went off to lndia together,
to live in an ashram.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.551
The last time l saw them was the day they left.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.312
Look, Adam will come round.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.631
l mean, you're not going to have
a problem getting a divorce!

16:45.680 --> 16:47.591
<i>ADAM: She doesn't want one.</i>

16:47.680 --> 16:49.591
- What?
- Why?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.716
Because l'm insisting on it.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.436
We had a row.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.476
A big row.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.831
She threw my gnome at me.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.830
You're lucky it's plastic.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.390
l feel so betrayed.
How could she not have told me?

17:09.480 --> 17:12.836
Adam, all couples
have secrets from each other.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.480
- We don't.
- Not that they're married to someone else!

17:15.560 --> 17:17.471
Do we?

17:17.560 --> 17:19.073
This changes everything.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.720
No, it doesn't. Rachel's no different.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.711
She has a husband!

17:23.800 --> 17:26.030
l'm living with a married woman!

17:26.119 --> 17:29.112
- My mother'll have a fit.
- Well, don't tell her!

17:29.200 --> 17:31.509
Yeah, it worked for Rachel long enough.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.433
l said to her,
''Listen, you bollocks, you better get a divorce.''

17:34.520 --> 17:37.796
- What was her reaction?
- The gnome.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.830
Then she yelled something about

17:40.920 --> 17:45.072
how she won't have me dictating
who she can and can't marry.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.071
Anyway, l was gone...

17:47.160 --> 17:49.754
Oh, yeah, that's another thing. Can l stay?

17:49.840 --> 17:52.559
(Both laugh uproariously, then stop)

18:05.640 --> 18:10.156
Well, l see your economy drive
hasn't reached your wine cellar.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.755
But l have made one significant saving -
l put a lock on the phone.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.796
He lets me have a key.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.751
Right, well,

18:20.840 --> 18:22.751
to business.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.549
The Lord giveth,
and the lnland Revenue taketh away.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.837
But sometimes they giveth back - a tax rebate.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.514
- ln fact, £1 ,000.
- A skiing holiday.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.194
A chance to recoup some of our losses.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.397
l see. Your harebrained scheme, our losses.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.677
- So what do you recommend, Larry?
- Marriage guidance. (Chuckles)

18:43.320 --> 18:46.869
lt really does depend on how much risk
you want to take.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.916
Probably less than you have.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.514
You still have time to take out a PEP,

18:51.600 --> 18:54.114
or a unit trust might be worth a look.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.191
- Do you have any literature?
- Reams.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.793
Right.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.668
We'll have a look through this lot
and make a decision.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.399
l don't think fiscal prudence is quite your forte.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.710
l'm not sure it's yours, old man.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.236
- lsn't your golf course waterlogged?
- And Marxist?

19:22.840 --> 19:26.674
<i>TV: Mia Farrow was once married to
which singer- Tony Bennett or Frank Sinatra?</i>

19:26.760 --> 19:28.716
Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatra.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.711
<i>Frank Sinatra.</i>

19:30.800 --> 19:32.756
<i>(AppIause)</i>

19:35.120 --> 19:37.076
<i>It is so cIose.</i>

19:38.840 --> 19:43.675
Which French general said to his wife,
''Not tonight, Josephine''?

19:43.760 --> 19:46.718
(Baby cries)
- l missed that answer!

19:47.760 --> 19:50.479
At least we know he's not constipated.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.754
(Jenny growls)

19:51.840 --> 19:53.990
Please! l'm trying to eat here.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.991
(Crying continues)

19:56.080 --> 19:58.071
Doesn't he ever stop crying?

19:58.160 --> 20:00.958
- Only when he's asleep.
- Not very often, then.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.951
- Pete?
- Yeah?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.031
Where's my milk l expressed?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.076
lt's not in here.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.596

20:13.840 --> 20:15.796

20:20.400 --> 20:22.311

20:22.400 --> 20:24.755
Well, it could be nice.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.311

Adam.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.432
Ah.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.196
(Silent exchange)

20:43.840 --> 20:45.751
How is Adam?

20:45.840 --> 20:48.479
Er, yeah, he's fine. You know, great.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.196
More trouble than the baby.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.554
Yesterday, he offered to baby-sit.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.471
Bye.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.471
Trust me.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.869
We went for a walk, not a long one.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.793
l didn't trust either of them to behave.

21:04.880 --> 21:10.637
Somebody told Adam that newborn babies
have a highly-developed survival instinct.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.838
<i>So you can get them to grip a rope,
and they'II know not to Iet go.</i>

21:26.720 --> 21:29.075
Thank God he landed in some washing.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.071
What, and Adam told you this?

21:31.160 --> 21:33.230
<i>The next-door neighbour did.</i>

21:36.640 --> 21:38.358
Rach, please get a divorce.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.238
Go on. Eh?

21:41.320 --> 21:43.231
For me.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.312
None of us like to be told what to do by our men,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.436
and usually it's grounds to do the opposite,

21:48.520 --> 21:51.910
but in this case,
and l say this as your closest friend,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.956

21:54.040 --> 21:58.989
l am 1 00%, completely,
totally and utterly in Adam's camp on this one.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.036
Me, too.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.990
Look, l am not being stubborn, it's just that...

22:08.560 --> 22:10.915
l am being stubborn, aren't l?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.438
Directory enquiries 1 92.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.238
What if he's ex-directory?

22:15.320 --> 22:17.276
As in ex-husband?

22:24.840 --> 22:27.400
Can l tell you something...man to man?

22:29.840 --> 22:31.751
l hate my life.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.072
l love the baby,
but it's everything else that goes with him.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.754
- Fatherhood.
- lt's hell.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.070
lt's no fun being a house guest either.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.789
l am a complete physical

22:48.680 --> 22:50.636
to extract confessions.

22:51.680 --> 22:54.558
- Does Jenny feel the same way?
- Oh, no way. She's a woman.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.756
- Comes naturally to her.
- Mm.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.358

23:02.440 --> 23:04.715

24:11.480 --> 24:13.994
lt is not a date.
She just wants to discuss a divorce.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.709
What's to discuss? ''l want a divorce.''
She could put that on a postcard.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.429
And still have room
for ''lots of love'' on the bottom.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.034

dredging up painful memories.

24:35.480 --> 24:39.393
At least l didn't sound like

- Oh, once!

24:53.800 --> 24:57.839

- Suzie?

25:07.320 --> 25:09.356

- Dunno.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.351

25:17.680 --> 25:19.636
Wow, that is supple.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.037

26:31.560 --> 26:34.120
Yeah. As soon as l got your message.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.592

29:31.680 --> 29:33.591

29:33.680 --> 29:36.638
- Really glad you're back.
- Why? ls the loo still buggered?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.911
Yeah, a little bit, but...

29:39.000 --> 29:40.319
l've missed you.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.311

29:42.400 --> 29:46.234

30:01.440 --> 30:02.998

30:03.080 --> 30:05.389
lt means you don't understand
what you're reading.

30:05.480 --> 30:09.473
Who can blame me? l've just read a sentence
five lines long with only one verb in it.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.279
- Who writes stuff like that?
- Lawyers.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.909
Well, they should have it checked
by human beings.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.434
And what's this column of figures?

30:18.520 --> 30:22.354
Who cares?
The only figure l'm interested in is yours.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.196
(Knock at door)

30:27.720 --> 30:29.631
Come in!

30:29.720 --> 30:31.631
Forgive to interrupt.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.917
Can l use the telephone, please,
because my mother...

30:35.000 --> 30:39.710
My sister called me and l don't think my mother
very well, so is it possible to use the phone?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.756
Yes, yes, all right!

30:41.840 --> 30:43.990
You want to give me the key again?

30:44.080 --> 30:46.036
Yes, Ramona.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.796
- Noches.
- Noches.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.116
(Mimics) Noches.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.196
What does she mean, again?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.798
You haven't mentioned the divorce?

31:03.880 --> 31:06.678
- l didn't want to rush it.
- You've been separated seven years!

31:06.760 --> 31:09.433
- lt's hardly indecent haste!
- l will tell him in my own time.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.748
When?

31:10.840 --> 31:12.751
l dunno!

31:12.840 --> 31:15.957
Well, can you give me a clue?
This side of your golden wedding?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.996
Adam, look...

31:19.840 --> 31:22.798
He has had a really rough time recently.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.917
He's been dropped by his record company.
And...

31:26.000 --> 31:28.070
He's got nowhere else to stay,

31:28.160 --> 31:31.152
and...and it's only going to be
for a couple of days,

31:31.240 --> 31:33.993
so you'd just better try and be nice to him.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.991

31:36.080 --> 31:38.230
Fine. You just get out.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.231

- Yes.
