00:46.200 --> 00:49.921
<i>Scorch, Scorch, are you there?</i>

00:50.080 --> 00:51.525
<i>Come on, Scorch, get back to me.</i>

00:51.680 --> 00:54.160
<i>You haven't run off
and done something reckless, have you?</i>

00:54.360 --> 00:57.409
Gary, we've got a problem!

00:57.840 --> 00:59.524
<i>That's my brother, Scorch.</i>

00:59.680 --> 01:01.250
<i>As usual, he's in trouble.</i>

01:01.400 --> 01:02.925
<i>How did he get into this mess?</i>

01:03.120 --> 01:05.885
<i>For that, I have to go back
a long, long time.</i>

01:07.720 --> 01:10.849
<i>Forty-seven minutes ago.
Baby rescue mission. Planet Gnarlach.</i>

01:13.640 --> 01:14.880
<i>Quiet, Scorch.</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:18.442
Whatever you do,
don't wake the Gnarlachs.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.769
<i>Hey, that's me, Gary Supernova.</i>

01:20.920 --> 01:24.322
<i>I work in Mission Control,
which means I control the mission.</i>

01:24.520 --> 01:27.126
<i>Scorch doesn't see it that way.</i>

01:27.680 --> 01:29.921
Oh, relax, Gary, they're fast asleep.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.922
<i>And that is a Gnarlach.</i>

01:33.080 --> 01:36.050
<i>- Scary, slimy...</i>

01:36.240 --> 01:38.322
<i>- ...and surprisingly stinky.</i>

01:38.480 --> 01:40.289
<i>Uploading that to Blue Tube.</i>

01:40.440 --> 01:43.887
Gary, this place smells worse
than the latrines at the BASA Academy.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.367
Mmm. Thank you for that.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.727
<i>Um, I was programmed
at the BASA Academy.</i>

01:48.920 --> 01:50.331
<i>The only thing I smelled there
was progress.</i>

01:50.480 --> 01:51.481
Zip it, James.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.802
<i>The name's Bing, by the way. James Bing.</i>

01:53.960 --> 01:55.246
<i>All right, Scorch,
let's find those babies</i>

01:55.400 --> 01:56.731
<i>and get you out of there.</i>

01:56.880 --> 01:59.531
Bingo.
Spacecraft identified.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.486
Good. Now proceed with extreme caution.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.684
Negative.
Proceeding with style.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.080
Not style again! Scorch! Shh!

02:09.240 --> 02:11.811
Hah! Triple Star System
into a Reverse Galaxy,

02:11.960 --> 02:13.928
followed by a Double Black Hole
with a twist!

02:14.080 --> 02:16.481
And he sticks the landing!

02:16.640 --> 02:18.369
<i>Now proceed with caution.</i>

02:20.680 --> 02:24.207
<i>OK, Scorch, the babies
should be straight ahead.</i>

02:24.360 --> 02:25.600
Copy that.

02:29.800 --> 02:30.767
No!

02:31.880 --> 02:34.486
Bad news, little brother.
We're too late.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.529
They've eaten the babies!

02:38.960 --> 02:40.530
It's so unfair!

02:40.720 --> 02:42.643
Scorch, they're right behind you.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.689
- What?

02:44.840 --> 02:48.208
Oh.
Hi, little guys.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.682
- Uncle Scorch is here to rescue you.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.490
- Coochie, coochie, coo.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.086
<i>Yeah, Gary, maybe tell Scorch to keep
his voice down in this situation?</i>

02:59.280 --> 03:01.521
<i>- Just a thought.</i>
- Scorch, quiet!

03:01.680 --> 03:05.401
Gary, you should see them.
They're so cute. It's magical.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.767
<i>You're gonna wake up
the whole neighborhood.</i>

03:07.920 --> 03:10.048
And this is not a good neighborhood.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.361
- Peekaboo!
<i>- Scorch?</i>

03:16.800 --> 03:19.326
- Excuse me.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.767
<i>- Oh, good, here we go again.</i>
- Scorch!

03:25.800 --> 03:29.122
Gary, we've got a problem!

03:30.640 --> 03:33.166
Of course we have a problem.
You never listen to me.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.721
You said there were 12 Gnarlachs, Gary.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.689
No, I said 1200.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.842
Uh, nope, I don't think you did.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.288
- There are 1200 Gnarlachs down there.
- Got it.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.523
- Twelve-hundred baby-eating Gnarlachs.
- Got it.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.921
Twelve-hundred of our archenemies,
the Gnarlachs.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.281
- Twelve-hundred of 'em.
- Got it.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.364
Nope. I think I'd remember
if you said 1200.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.171
- Now do your thing.
- OK.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.891
Chasm of death in 20 yards and closing.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.490
Deploy grappling hook in three...

04:06.640 --> 04:07.846
...two...

04:15.040 --> 04:16.041
...one.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.731
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

04:21.880 --> 04:24.531
- You see that?

04:24.680 --> 04:27.001
Boom! That's what I'm talking about!

04:27.200 --> 04:30.409
- Scorch me, baby!

04:30.560 --> 04:33.370
Helpless babies, your chariot awaits.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.601
In your face, Gnarlachs!

04:39.080 --> 04:41.481
I got the babies! Ha-ha!

04:44.040 --> 04:45.565
- Oh, no, no.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.286
Guys, no, no.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.408
- No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.
- Huh?

04:50.600 --> 04:53.251
- Shh! Gary?
<i>- I'm on it.</i>

04:56.640 --> 04:58.688
Ha! Take that!

05:10.920 --> 05:15.528
<i>Supernova-9,</i>
you are clear for landing on planet Dad!

05:15.680 --> 05:19.048
Hey! This is a no-fly zone, mister.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.440
Very funny, Dad.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.921
I'm serious.
This console's expensive, Kipper.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.801
<i>Console? I mean...
I mean, I'm right here. Unbelievable.</i>

05:26.960 --> 05:28.928
Can I have my spaceship back?

05:30.040 --> 05:33.328
- Mmm... No.
- Dad, you never let me do anything.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.562
OK, but be careful.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.210
Yeah, yeah, I know.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.805
- Ahh!

05:41.960 --> 05:43.564
- It burns! It burns!

05:43.720 --> 05:46.530
- Ohh!
- Sorry. Dad. Hey!

05:46.680 --> 05:49.889
OK, let's play the game
where you sit on your hands.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.451
- That game stinks.
<i>- Hey, Gary!</i>

05:51.600 --> 05:53.204
<i>Be a pal, park this puppy, will ya?</i>

05:53.360 --> 05:56.284
Activating remote assistance.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.767
Time to watch your old man bring in
the <i>Supernova-9</i> for a landing.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.441
- Scorch is back!

06:11.640 --> 06:13.881
I love you, planet Baab!

06:14.040 --> 06:15.326
Whoo!

06:16.960 --> 06:18.121
Boom!

06:21.080 --> 06:22.445
Cool!

06:32.840 --> 06:35.446
And that is how you do that.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.604
<i>- Gary!</i>
- What? OK, that's terrifying.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.570
Why do you always call me
in jumbo-head mode?

06:41.720 --> 06:44.803
<i>We've received an SOS from
an uncharted sector of the galaxy.</i>

06:44.960 --> 06:46.769
<i>Prepare for Scorch's next mission.</i>

06:46.920 --> 06:48.888
Copy that, boss.
Where are we headed?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.281
<i>He's going to the Dark Planet.</i>

06:51.440 --> 06:53.488
Lena, are you crazy?

06:54.960 --> 06:57.691
Let me... rephrase that.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.845
They call it the Dark Planet
because nobody ever comes back.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.843
It's like going into a black hole.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.604
<i>He leaves in an hour.</i>

07:06.120 --> 07:10.330
Whoa! He's going to the Dark Planet?
Wicked!

07:10.480 --> 07:12.050
Stay here. Don't touch anything.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.720
And nobody's going to the Dark Planet.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.645
We are going to the Dark Planet!

07:20.640 --> 07:22.642
- Scorch!
- Scorch, one question!

07:22.800 --> 07:24.040
No questions, just pictures.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.321
Yeah, baby!

07:28.840 --> 07:30.569
Excuse me, Scorch!
Scorch Supernova!

07:30.760 --> 07:33.331
Yes, the beautiful young lady
in the front row.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.051
- Oh!
- Hi, sweetie. Welcome home.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.249
- Gabby, we're live.
- Oh, right.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.448
Hi. Tell us about the mission.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.807
- The Dark Planet.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.724
It's heroic, even for me.

07:47.880 --> 07:51.521
- No one has ever come back alive.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.402
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Coming through.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.564
- Have you had time to prepare?
- Uh, no, no, we haven't.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.122
- Gary Supernova, my baby brother.
- Uh, fact check: I'm older than him.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.489
Gary works all the gizmos and
bleep-bloops here in the nerd factory.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.608
- I work in Mission Control.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.922
We use a trans-inducified
field matrix to...

08:09.080 --> 08:12.562
Mmm-hmm. And that's today's edition
of The Boring Report.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.171
- Back to you, Gabby.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.962
For BNN, this is Gabby Babblebrock,
reporting live from BASA headquarters.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.691
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- And I feel sorry for her.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.083
Now, listen, we know almost nothing
about the Dark Planet.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.686
No one does.
We need to postpone the mission.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.366
I would, but I've already
contacted all my sponsors.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.727
Dark Planet Cola!
Destroy your taste buds!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.722
This is 800 percent sugar.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.451
That's what makes it good for kids.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.446
Oh. Hey!

08:41.840 --> 08:43.842
Plus, I've already taken the photos
for the new cereal box.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.007
When?

08:47.160 --> 08:49.128
- Just now.
- Scorchios?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.442
- There's a surprise in every box.
- Ah!

08:51.600 --> 08:52.647
- Whoa, I'm pretty good at this.
- OK...

08:52.840 --> 08:54.285
- Come... Come on!
- I could do this all day.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.442
- Whee!
- Knock it off!

08:56.640 --> 08:59.291
- We need to think this through.
- I have.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.129
Someone out there needs my help,
and I am going to help them.

09:04.280 --> 09:08.569
OK, but if you go now,
I can't help you help them.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.963
You know, Gary, you're absolutely right.
There's no sense in rushing things.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.566
Why don't you pull up the star charts
in the briefing room,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.643
and we'll talk about this
with the whole team.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.643
You got it, partner.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.126
That should keep him busy.
Let's fire up the ship!

09:48.840 --> 09:51.605
Computer, load all information
on the Dark Planet.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.481
<i>All right, just a sec.
Scanning files, scanning files...</i>

09:55.640 --> 09:57.847
<i>Here we are. The Dark Planet:</i>

09:58.000 --> 10:01.561
<i>A remote M-class planet
located 400 light-years</i>

10:01.720 --> 10:04.405
<i>past the Taurus Molecular Cloud.</i>

10:04.560 --> 10:06.801
<i>A strange and terrifying environment,</i>

10:07.000 --> 10:10.971
<i>the only known world in which
evolution is taking place in reverse.</i>

10:11.120 --> 10:13.851
<i>It began with intelligent,
attractive beings,</i>

10:14.000 --> 10:16.207
<i>but was soon overrun
by ugly, aggressive</i>

10:16.360 --> 10:18.442
<i>and quite terrifying
dim-witted creatures.</i>

10:18.600 --> 10:20.284
Yuck. Gross.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.728
<i>As you can see, from gentle
intelligence to savage stupidity.</i>

10:23.880 --> 10:25.962
<i>They have a strange custom
of dividing themselves</i>

10:26.120 --> 10:29.203
<i>into what they call countries,
whose boundaries they often dispute,</i>

10:29.360 --> 10:31.124
<i>which causes them to go to war.</i>

10:31.280 --> 10:34.523
<i>The pattern seems to be that the winner
of the war then goes into decline</i>

10:34.680 --> 10:36.364
<i>while the loser prospers.</i>

10:36.520 --> 10:39.364
<i>We have also deduced
that the people of this planet choose</i>

10:39.520 --> 10:43.161
<i>leaders according to the oddity
and profusion of their facial hair.</i>

10:43.320 --> 10:47.245
<i>They worship money, soup, marker pens,
something called dental floss</i>

10:47.400 --> 10:50.051
<i>- and this man, whose name is Cowell.</i>
- Oh, terrifying!

10:50.200 --> 10:53.283
<i>He's known for his strange
accent, being very, very rich,</i>

10:53.440 --> 10:56.284
<i>showing off, wearing glasses indoors.
I like him.</i>

10:57.040 --> 11:00.408
<i>One hundred and six advanced life-forms
have landed on the Dark Planet...</i>

11:00.560 --> 11:02.961
- What?
<i>- ...to attempt friendly fairst contact.</i>

11:03.120 --> 11:05.771
<i>Not a single one has returned.</i>

11:05.920 --> 11:07.570
Uncle Scorch!

11:07.720 --> 11:09.688
Hey, Kipper!

11:11.520 --> 11:12.806
<i>You were awesome out there.</i>

11:12.960 --> 11:15.691
<i>Thanks, pal.
Does your dad know you're here?</i>

11:15.840 --> 11:21.449
<i>I'm supposed to be waiting in his
office, but Mission Control is boring.</i>

11:21.600 --> 11:25.002
<i>I know. Isn't it? It's all...</i>

11:25.200 --> 11:27.965
<i>I'm more
of an astronaut, like you.</i>

11:28.600 --> 11:30.204
Take me with you this time.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.489
Wow. That sure would upset your dad,
which is something I love to do.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.563
But I'll tell you what, Kipper...

11:35.720 --> 11:38.530
If I get into trouble,
you come rescue me.

11:38.680 --> 11:43.402
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Kip,
Junior Adventurer, at your service!

11:43.560 --> 11:45.961
Junior Adventurer, are you? Hmm.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.283
- Well, what have we here?
- Blast tape!

11:49.440 --> 11:51.488
Ready for a training mission?

11:52.240 --> 11:53.685
OK, we've crash-landed.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.810
We're surrounded by a tribe
of slimy, green aliens,

11:56.960 --> 11:58.610
and they are closing in on us.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.524
What do you do? You do this! Watch!

12:00.680 --> 12:02.523
- Take that!
- Cool!

12:02.680 --> 12:04.682
- Time to take out the trash!
- Awesome!

12:04.840 --> 12:07.605
Scorch me, baby!

12:08.560 --> 12:11.086
Oh, they got me!

12:11.760 --> 12:14.764
- Kipper, it's up to you.
- Wicked!

12:14.960 --> 12:17.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.481
Astronaut training.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.802
Blast tape?
Kip shouldn't be playing with it.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.088
He shouldn't even be looking at it.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.890
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:25.800 --> 12:30.010
Sorry, Barry.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.764
Ooh!

12:31.920 --> 12:35.925
- Back to my office.
- See ya, Uncle Scorch.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.286
Scorch...

12:37.480 --> 12:40.051
Mission Control, we've got
a mad-dad situation here.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.727
- You're darn right I'm mad.
- Why is this ship on?

12:45.360 --> 12:48.842
Oh!

12:49.000 --> 12:52.163
You sent me upstairs so you could
rush off to the Dark Planet.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.560
- Yep.
- Ah!

12:53.720 --> 12:55.529
I thought we'd agreed
to postpone the launch.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.206
<i>Launch in T-minus 30 minutes.</i>

13:03.560 --> 13:06.370
It's too risky to send
Scorch out there. Please.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.522
Drop it, Gary. I'm warning you.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.451
I'm the mission controller.
Does nobody here care what I think?

13:11.640 --> 13:12.880
- No.
- Not really.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.771
- Nope.
- Then why am I even here?

13:15.920 --> 13:19.049
It'll be fine, Gary.
He's done this a hundred times.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.010
We've done this a hundred times.
We're a team.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.925
I'm the brains and you're the brawn.
That's what you always said.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.040
I said it to make you feel better,
little brother.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.531
Scorch, stop calling me that.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.600
You've been trying to control me
your whole life.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.166
Isn't that why
you joined Mission Control?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.051
I'm looking out for you.
That's what brothers do.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.204
Oh, please.
You sit around here pushing buttons

13:40.360 --> 13:43.569
while I am out there risking my neck.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.445
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see
you do it without me.

13:46.600 --> 13:50.889
Any time. Any place.
Little brother.

13:51.040 --> 13:55.602
If you insist on going through
with this idiotic macho stunt,

13:55.760 --> 13:57.489
you can count me out.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.644
Buh... wai...
You're gonna quit?

14:02.080 --> 14:05.482
Well, you can't quit!
You... you're fired!

14:05.960 --> 14:09.760
You can't fire me.
Because I quit! Humph!

14:24.280 --> 14:26.089
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey, space ranger.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.402
Come on, boy.
Let's go play flisbee.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.643
- You're home early.
- Scorch fired me.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.802
What? He can't fire you.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.371
That's what I said, so I quit.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.608
So you quit after you were fired?

14:37.760 --> 14:39.649
Hey, whose side are you on?

14:40.120 --> 14:42.691
I think someone should lock
the two of you in a room

14:42.840 --> 14:45.650
until you figure out how to get along.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.610
I hope he gets stranded.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.364
What are you doing, Dad?

14:58.520 --> 15:02.650
Uh... Oh, nothing.
Just working on the old rocket boots.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.171
Cool! Can I help?

15:07.320 --> 15:10.005
Following in your dad's footsteps,
eh, Kipper?

15:10.160 --> 15:12.322
Hey! That makes this
an official father-son moment!

15:12.480 --> 15:13.845
What's this do?

15:15.320 --> 15:16.651
Whoa! Look out!

15:16.800 --> 15:19.929
Aah! Ah, incoming!

15:22.600 --> 15:25.763
Gary! Why is there
a rocket boot in our bathroom?

15:28.440 --> 15:31.011
<i>This is BNN.</i>

15:31.200 --> 15:33.487
<i>We are live as
Scorch Supernova investigates</i>

15:33.640 --> 15:37.087
<i>a mysterious intergalactic cry for help.
Brought to you by Dark Planet Cola.</i>

15:37.240 --> 15:38.765
Dark Planet Cola!

15:38.920 --> 15:41.048
<i>Scorch is stepping off
the Supernova-9 now.</i>

15:41.200 --> 15:43.407
<i>Oh boy,
is he looking good in that suit.</i>

15:43.560 --> 15:45.324
<i>Mmm.</i>

15:45.480 --> 15:48.609
<i>Oh! Let's go live
to the Dark Planet's surface.</i>

15:49.520 --> 15:52.046
<i>This is Scorch Supernova,
live from the Dark Planet.</i>

15:52.200 --> 15:54.771
<i>I'm here responding
to an intergalactic SOS call,</i>

15:54.920 --> 15:57.082
<i>and on the lookout for helpless victims.</i>

15:57.240 --> 15:58.765
Yeah!

15:58.920 --> 16:01.924
<i>Switching over to remote cams, Gabby.
Wish me luck.</i>

16:02.080 --> 16:04.440
<i>Our planet's greatest hero,
risking life and limb...</i>

16:04.560 --> 16:08.724
He's so awesome. I'm gonna be
just like Uncle Scorch someday.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.689
Well, better have another kid.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.764
- Gary.
- Just what every father wants to hear.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.241
My son wants to be like
my dim-witted brother.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.289
Oh, relax. He's excited.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.286
Besides, what could Scorch possibly
give your son that you can't?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.603
<i>I dedicate this planet
to my nephew, Kip!</i>

16:25.760 --> 16:28.240
I got my own planet? Awesome!

16:28.400 --> 16:31.165
- OK, that's pretty hard to top.

16:31.320 --> 16:37.009
<i>There appears to be a light source
coming from a light of some kind.</i>

16:37.160 --> 16:40.687
Oh, no, no, no. Don't do it!
Do not go into the light.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.810
<i>- Going to the light.</i>
- Wow.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.690
It's so beautiful.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.969
- Oh...

17:08.119 --> 17:09.359
Huh?

17:11.440 --> 17:14.046
A victim! Commencing rescue op.

17:17.079 --> 17:21.130
Greetings! We've heard your call
for help and have come to save you.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.089
I am Scorch Supernova.

17:26.319 --> 17:32.202
Strange. On my planet we shake hands,
but we can do it your way.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.842
That's humiliating.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.162
Boy, you sure love to wave.

17:39.320 --> 17:43.211
I love it, too,
but my arms are getting tired.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.647
- What was that?

17:47.320 --> 17:48.651
What...?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.690
Hmm...

17:51.880 --> 17:55.805
- No!

17:55.960 --> 17:57.962
No! Hang on!

17:58.960 --> 18:00.644
Look at me. Look at me!

18:01.680 --> 18:04.047
Don't you die on me, buddy!

18:08.480 --> 18:10.881
No!

18:11.040 --> 18:12.201
Moving in.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.164
- Scorch!
- We got a blue one!

18:15.520 --> 18:19.161
All he wanted to do was wave!

18:21.480 --> 18:23.130
Peter, Jackson is down!

18:23.280 --> 18:26.648
Man, what is it with aliens
and this desolate roadside 7-Eleven?

18:28.120 --> 18:31.727
Halt! Alien! Do not
use your advanced technology against us!

18:32.240 --> 18:34.720
- Marty, Quentin, move it out!
- Scorch me, baby.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.763
- Get out of there!

18:46.160 --> 18:49.607
- Time to take out the trash!

18:50.240 --> 18:51.401
Who's next?

18:51.560 --> 18:52.721
Yeah! Look at him go!

18:52.880 --> 18:54.803
Not now!
Scorch is in real trouble.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.281
Aim for the space-suity thingy!

19:09.480 --> 19:11.642
- Look out!

19:14.360 --> 19:16.681
Uh... uh-oh.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.285
Time to get outta here.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.281
That's not good.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.687
Gary, we better find
another way outta here.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.966
Gary?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.531
Scorch.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.402
OK, I take...

19:47.560 --> 19:49.164
You know something?

19:49.320 --> 19:51.129
I love you guys.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.528
Welcome to Earth.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.041
Tag him and bag him, boys.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.607
<i>The Baabian Aeronautics
and Space Administration have confirmed</i>

20:23.760 --> 20:28.607
<i>that all communications
with Scorch Supernova have been severed.</i>

20:28.760 --> 20:33.607
<i>At this point, we can only assume
that our planet's greatest hero is...</i>

20:33.760 --> 20:35.649
<i>...is dead?</i>

20:35.800 --> 20:38.087
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do this.</i>

20:38.240 --> 20:40.891
- Oh, no.
- You said you hoped he got stranded.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.849
You wanted this to happen!

20:43.000 --> 20:46.368
I'm sure your father didn't say that.
Did you?

20:46.520 --> 20:49.046
We've gotta get
to the Dark Planet and find him!

20:49.200 --> 20:51.202
Just hang on, Kip.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.089
Come on. Come on, pick up.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.041
<i>Oh, hello, Gary.
I thought you quit.</i>

20:56.200 --> 20:58.202
This is important.
Scorch has been captured.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.368
<i>- We've got it under control.</i>
- Come on!

21:01.680 --> 21:04.081
Dad, Uncle Scorch told me
to come rescue him.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.681
- We can be the rescue team.
- Kip!

21:06.840 --> 21:09.446
We're his family.
We need to go save him.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.045
I'm doing everything I can.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.531
You're not doing anything!

21:12.680 --> 21:14.523
- You're talking on the phone!

21:14.680 --> 21:16.648
Go to your room.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.241
Kipper?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.970
Kipper, I know you want to rescue him,

21:50.160 --> 21:53.050
and it's very brave of you.

21:54.760 --> 22:00.244
Even though your uncle and I
fight sometimes, we're still brothers.

22:01.680 --> 22:07.562
And I will do whatever it takes
to get him home, I promise you.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.048
I love you, buddy.
Come on, give us a hug.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.611
- Huh?

22:14.760 --> 22:16.330
Kip? Kip!

22:18.440 --> 22:20.920
Kira! Kip's gone! Kip's gone!

22:21.080 --> 22:22.241
- What?
- The rescue pod.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.125
We've gotta get
to BASA before he does.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.250
We're using the rocket boots.

22:29.400 --> 22:33.246
Are you crazy? The gyroscope is off,
the thrust mechanism is broken.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.400
They're not ready to fly.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.320
I spent 15 years as a BASA test pilot.
It's not rocket science.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.165
That's exactly what it is.
They're rocket boots!

22:41.760 --> 22:45.321
Gary, turn off your brain and hang on.

22:49.280 --> 22:53.922
This is staggeringly dangerous!
You're not even in a rocket boot lane!

22:54.080 --> 22:55.491
Look out!

22:55.680 --> 22:57.489
- Oh! Ah,
- Sorry!

23:01.120 --> 23:03.521
- This is so emasculating.
- Do you want to drive?

23:03.680 --> 23:05.648
- No, I want to live.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.724
You're actually very good at this!

23:12.920 --> 23:14.445
Look out! Look out! Look out!

23:14.600 --> 23:16.762
- Sorry, Barry!

23:24.320 --> 23:26.049
We're coming, Kipper.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.720
- Where is he?

23:30.880 --> 23:35.283
- Kip! No, Kipper, no!
- Kip, stop!

23:39.400 --> 23:41.607
- Kip, up here!
- Kipper, please!

23:41.760 --> 23:44.684
<i>Automated launch
in T-minus 60 seconds.</i>

23:44.840 --> 23:46.126
Kip, up here!

23:46.320 --> 23:48.846
Gary, look out.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.090
This is a bad idea.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.003
Mom! Dad! Are you coming?

24:03.160 --> 24:04.321
No, honey, this isn't a game.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.131
It's stuck!

24:07.280 --> 24:09.886
Gary, do something!

24:10.040 --> 24:11.610
I'll shut down the launch.

24:11.800 --> 24:16.362
<i>Twelve, eleven...
You've chosen Terminate Launch.</i>

24:16.520 --> 24:17.885
<i>- To confirm, say yes.</i>
- Yes.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.122
<i>- You said "banana." Is that correct?</i>
- No.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.720
<i>- You replied "no."</i>
- Gary, hurry up!

24:21.760 --> 24:22.807
<i>Terminate Launch canceled.</i>

24:22.960 --> 24:24.724
- No! I mean yes!
- Ow!

24:24.880 --> 24:26.405
<i>- Is that a yes or a no?</i>
- No.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.607
<i>- Did you say yes?</i>
- Yes!

24:27.760 --> 24:29.649
<i>- Yes, you said yes, or...?</i>
- Yes! Yes!

24:29.800 --> 24:30.767
It's stuck!

24:30.920 --> 24:33.048
<i>Sorry, Gary. Did you say
yes to Terminate Launch?</i>

24:33.240 --> 24:35.561
- Yes!

24:35.920 --> 24:38.890
<i>- Launch terminated.</i>

24:39.080 --> 24:42.050
<i>- That was close.</i>
- Oh, Kip, you scared me.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.886
I'm sorry. I promised
Uncle Scorch I'd go save him.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.486
Don't you ever do that again.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.567
No. Kip's right.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.808
Scorch is my brother.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.088
- Honey?
- I've gotta go save him.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.290
Wait. What are you doing?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.602
<i>Excellent.
Launch sequence reengaged.</i>

25:00.760 --> 25:01.966
Gary?

25:02.120 --> 25:04.248
- Dad!
- I love you guys!

25:04.440 --> 25:06.761
- Dad!
- Gary!

25:17.920 --> 25:19.922
Lena, I need your help.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.600
- Kira!
- Gary was on that pod!

25:22.760 --> 25:26.526
Don't worry.
We'll make contact as soon as he lands.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.445
No, no, no. You have to send
someone after him.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.408
I don't have to do anything.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.449
You don't give the orders
around here anymore.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.807
Gary will never survive out there alone.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.803
Please, bring my dad back.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.089
Don't worry, little guy.
We're doing everything we can.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.165
What can I do to help?

25:44.320 --> 25:46.448
You're the one who wanted
to be a stay-at-home mom.

25:46.600 --> 25:50.161
So why don't you stay at home
and let me do my job.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.205
<i>Prepare for final approach,
Gary. Fasten your seatbelt.</i>

26:03.360 --> 26:04.202
Huh?

26:13.960 --> 26:14.961
Oh!

26:32.760 --> 26:36.162
I thought this movie
was supposed to be in 3-D.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.283
Shh. It is in 3-D.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.570
OK, that's better.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.611
<i>- Area 48.</i>

26:46.760 --> 26:48.125
<i>Area 49.</i>

26:48.280 --> 26:50.123
<i>Area 50.</i>

26:52.120 --> 26:55.010
<i>Landing gear deployed.</i>

26:58.360 --> 27:00.010
<i>Landing gear destroyed.</i>

27:11.280 --> 27:12.800
<i>Please exit with caution, Gary.</i>

27:12.840 --> 27:15.127
<i>Contents may have shifted
during the flight.</i>

27:15.320 --> 27:16.845
<i>It's all over the place, isn't it?</i>

27:25.960 --> 27:29.089
OK, OK, don't panic.
Remember your training.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.527
The safest thing to do
is wait in your pod.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.648
<i>Self-destruct sequence initiated.</i>

27:33.800 --> 27:36.246
What? Self-destruct?
You're a rescue pod!

27:36.400 --> 27:37.970
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.805
<i>- This one does, Gary.</i>
- This is ridiculous!

27:40.960 --> 27:44.248
<i>- Twenty-nine, 28, 27...</i>
- Hey, anybody! Help!

27:44.400 --> 27:46.164
<i>Is that your plan, Gary?
Panicking?</i>

27:46.320 --> 27:49.244
<i>- Sixteen, 15...</i>
- Come on!

27:49.400 --> 27:51.971
<i>Ticktock, Gary.
Come on. You're running out of time.</i>

27:52.880 --> 27:55.000
- Water landing, monster attack... Aha!
<i>- Ten, nine...</i>

27:55.080 --> 27:58.527
- Foolishly trapped inside pod!
<i>- ...eight, seven...</i>

27:58.680 --> 28:01.001
<i>...six, five...</i>

28:01.200 --> 28:03.202
<i>Time to panic.</i>

28:03.360 --> 28:05.010
<i>...three, two...</i>

28:05.200 --> 28:08.170
<i>- ...one. We're toast.</i>

28:29.760 --> 28:33.924
Ah... the technology
in this suit is incredible.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.684
- Now open it.
- Yes, sir.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.891
Yuck!

28:52.640 --> 28:53.641
Blubonium.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.531
Ten thousand times more powerful
than atomic energy.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.570
Hey. How'd that get in there?

28:59.720 --> 29:01.449
Oh, you're awake.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.285
Let me go! Let me outta here!

29:04.440 --> 29:06.363
Shh. Go back to sleep.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.449
<i>You're listening to Far-out,
Far-right Hour on C-Dub FM.</i>

29:17.600 --> 29:19.728
<i>Let's go to the phones! Caller?</i>

29:19.880 --> 29:23.726
This is Hawk calling.
I work at 7-Eleven near Area 51,

29:23.880 --> 29:26.406
and after years of waiting,
it finally happened!

29:26.560 --> 29:28.608
<i>You had a date with a girl.</i>

29:28.760 --> 29:30.603
What? No. A close-encounter, man!

29:30.760 --> 29:32.171
We looked out the window

29:32.320 --> 29:34.971
and this blue dude
was standing right there.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.441
- - It was awesome.
<i>- Hawk, Hawk, Hawk, listen to me.</i>

29:37.600 --> 29:38.931
<i>If what you say is true,</i>

29:39.080 --> 29:43.210
<i>they're here for one reason
and one reason only: abduction!</i>

30:05.480 --> 30:08.006
It's OK, bro! We're friends.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.680
- What are you doing?
- We gotta make a good impression.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.971
We need a peace offering.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.851
Huh?

30:23.320 --> 30:24.526
It's OK, little guy.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.209
Welcome to Earth, blue buddy.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.687
In an effort to avoid enslavement,

30:34.840 --> 30:39.562
I offer you the finest chilled
refreshment known to the human race.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.205
He likes it!

30:49.360 --> 30:52.523
Of course he likes it.
Where's your brand loyalty, man?

30:54.200 --> 30:56.601
No!

30:58.000 --> 31:01.004
You're gonna regret it!
Don't do it!

31:04.000 --> 31:06.924
OK, OK, OK.
Calm down, blue buddy. It's OK.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.411
It's called a brain freeze.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.564
If you're gonna hang with us,
you need to learn to sip.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.364
Take him away!

31:28.360 --> 31:32.081
- Put me down!
- Little blue buddy...

32:30.880 --> 32:32.086
Ah!

32:34.520 --> 32:37.603
Stop this! Let me out!

32:43.880 --> 32:44.961
Huh?

32:45.600 --> 32:50.288
<i>Hello, creature from another world.
Welcome to planet Earth.</i>

32:50.440 --> 32:52.408
<i>You are now a guest
of the US government.</i>

32:52.560 --> 32:55.370
<i>When interacting
with the inhabitants of Earth,</i>

32:55.520 --> 33:00.367
<i>or humans, you should abide
by the following basic etiquette.</i>

33:00.520 --> 33:02.363
<i>Handshake, good.</i>

33:02.520 --> 33:06.764
<i>- Death ray... bad. No vaporizing.</i>

33:06.960 --> 33:09.930
<i>Modern Earth culture
also frowns on the following:</i>

33:10.080 --> 33:13.129
<i>eating human flesh,
probing, silver jumpsuits,</i>

33:13.280 --> 33:15.931
<i>abduction, Communism, nudity.</i>

33:16.080 --> 33:19.880
<i>If you or someone you know is
responsible for building the pyramids,</i>

33:20.040 --> 33:21.121
<i>we'd like to know about it.</i>

33:21.160 --> 33:24.040
<i>If you've been to the Bermuda Triangle
and brought someone home with you,</i>

33:24.080 --> 33:26.128
<i>please return them immediately.</i>

33:26.280 --> 33:28.282
<i>And, finally,
if you're a resident alien,</i>

33:28.480 --> 33:32.690
<i>please report
to the immigration desk on level 316.</i>

33:32.840 --> 33:35.320
<i>We hope this has been
an informative look at our planet,</i>

33:35.480 --> 33:38.484
<i>and urge you not to seek war against us.</i>

33:38.640 --> 33:41.120
<i>Enjoy your stay here at Area 51.</i>

33:46.240 --> 33:48.481
Let's take a peek
into that head of yours.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.887
<i>Brain scan processing.</i>

33:55.760 --> 33:59.810
<i>- Stupid. Simple. Dimwit. Average.</i>

34:01.440 --> 34:04.171
<i>Smart. Genius. Genius. Genius...</i>

34:05.720 --> 34:07.643
We got ourselves a real genius!

34:07.800 --> 34:09.768
Shanker's gonna want to meet you.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.763
- Here's the brainiac, sir.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.926
So... you're the genius.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.724
What are you gonna do to me?
Probe me? Dissect me?

34:22.880 --> 34:25.201
- Chop me up and eat me?
- Relax.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.203
I'm a big fan of your work.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.521
Scorch!

34:28.679 --> 34:30.125
What have you done with my brother?

34:30.280 --> 34:32.168
We'll get to him soon enough.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.607
This is your design, isn't it?

34:35.560 --> 34:36.846
How do you know that?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.606
Well, color me impressed.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.600
And I consider myself a connoisseur
when it comes to alien technology.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.239
I could use a man with your brain power.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.563
You see, Gary,
I run a work release program.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.643
You work, then I release you.

34:54.360 --> 34:58.524
You are going to make sure my latest
project goes off without a hitch.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.001
I'm not doing anything
until I see Scorch.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.487
You can whine
till you're blue in the face,

35:03.640 --> 35:05.847
but I call the shots around here.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.690
- Hmm?

35:07.840 --> 35:09.729
Everyone out, now!
Double-time!

35:09.920 --> 35:13.322
Wait! Wait! We're not finished!
Where's my brother?

35:29.680 --> 35:32.843
<i>Hello, Shanky-panky.</i>

35:33.000 --> 35:34.490
Hello, my darling.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.005
You look ravishing.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.640
<i>Oh, you always say that.</i>

35:38.800 --> 35:40.086
That's because it's true.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.886
<i>- Did you get my present?</i>
- Yes.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.601
- I did.
<i>- So do you like it?</i>

35:46.760 --> 35:49.001
It's... OK.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.491
<i>Pookie, what's wrong?</i>

35:50.640 --> 35:54.770
Nothing, it's fine.
I just... I was expecting more.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.644
<i>Well, that was just a sample.</i>

35:56.840 --> 35:58.683
<i>There's more coming, I promise.</i>

35:59.600 --> 36:02.490
<i>I'm bringing enough
so we can rule the universe together.</i>

36:02.680 --> 36:04.887
Hurry, my love.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.124
Gentle, gentle.
Just set me down nice and easy.

36:23.520 --> 36:27.127
Hello? Anyone?

36:28.320 --> 36:31.051
You can't do this! I know my rights!

36:32.720 --> 36:34.529
Ugh.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.330
Hey! Hi there, roomie!

36:38.280 --> 36:40.521
Hey, are you finished with the toilet?

36:40.680 --> 36:42.648
Huh?

36:42.840 --> 36:46.287
I'm Thurman. Pleased to meet you.

36:46.440 --> 36:50.650
Hello. Oh, my goodness.
You're all covered in slime.

36:50.800 --> 36:54.805
- Ugh! You're all dried out.
- Not anymore.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.201
I'm from Zaddlebrok 475.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.768
- Never heard of it.
- You've heard of Zaddlebrok 473.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.287
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
- It's two planets over.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.405
Makes sense.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.891
Anyway, you should settle in.
Throw your stuff on the bottom bunk.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.408
I gotta get outta here.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.040
Don't I get a phone call?

37:17.200 --> 37:20.682
Oh, yeah.
A phone call? A big-screen TV?

37:20.880 --> 37:22.769
Egyptian cotton sheets?

37:22.920 --> 37:26.003
- This is Area 51, man. Wake up!

37:26.160 --> 37:29.209
Keep it down!
I'm trying to get some shut-eye.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.569
Oh, I get it.
Shut-eye. You've got one eye.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.690
Are you making fun
of my one eye?

37:36.840 --> 37:40.731
Easy, Io. Remember the program.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.850
Just stick to the program,
stick to the program.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.961
I apologize for my outburst.

37:47.160 --> 37:51.165
My name is lo, and I'm working
through some anger issues.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.367
She seems nice.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.046
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah, great gal. I'm Doc.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.568
- You're a doctor?
- Radio talk show therapist.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.008
Same thing without all the training,
credentials or qualifications.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.003
So, Little Boy Blue, you got a name?

38:04.160 --> 38:08.210
Gary. I'm here looking for my brother.
Have you seen him?

38:08.360 --> 38:09.760
What's he look like? Blue like you?

38:09.880 --> 38:12.804
Yes, exactly like me
except with huge muscles

38:12.960 --> 38:14.883
<i>and a chiseled jaw and perfect teeth.</i>

38:15.040 --> 38:17.566
OK, so you're the ugly brother.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.961
Oh, well, I wouldn't put it that way.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.168
Oh, it's not a question.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.887
Look, Scorch can bust us out of here.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.610
He's got a ship. He can get us home.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.649
There's only one way out of here.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.371
Invent enough cool stuff
and Shanker lets you go.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.000
That's how Area 51 works.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.640
<i>He lures the smartest aliens
from across the universe</i>

38:37.800 --> 38:39.404
<i>and throws us in jail.</i>

38:39.560 --> 38:41.961
<i>Take Thurman. He was a professor.</i>

38:42.120 --> 38:44.930
<i>Those four hands invented
touchscreen technology.</i>

38:45.560 --> 38:48.086
<i>Or Io. She used to be a librarian.</i>

38:48.240 --> 38:49.730
<i>She got so mad
looking stuff up for people</i>

38:49.880 --> 38:51.962
<i>that she invented the search engine.</i>

38:52.120 --> 38:54.407
And most importantly, me.

38:55.440 --> 39:00.048
<i>After my radio show got famous,
I invented social networking.</i>

39:00.200 --> 39:02.771
<i>I've got five billion
pending friend requests.</i>

39:03.520 --> 39:05.602
<i>That's how Shanker
bankrolls this place.</i>

39:05.760 --> 39:09.082
<i>He rips off our technology
and sells it to the world.</i>

39:09.280 --> 39:11.442
<i>He's got deals with everybody.</i>

39:11.600 --> 39:14.570
<i>Apple, Facebook, them Google guys.</i>

39:14.720 --> 39:17.007
You think humans could build this stuff?

39:17.160 --> 39:18.400
I don't think so.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.369
Who do you think invented the Internet?

39:20.520 --> 39:23.126
<i>Cell phones? Computer animation?</i>

39:23.280 --> 39:24.850
We did!

39:25.000 --> 39:28.368
Thank you. I love tech history.
But have you seen my brother?

39:29.720 --> 39:33.167
<i>Attention, aliens. Please
report immediately to the cafeteria.</i>

39:33.320 --> 39:38.326
<i>And remember, levitating in
the passageways is strictly prohibited.</i>

39:38.520 --> 39:41.126
- What the heck is that?

39:42.880 --> 39:46.930
There is only one creature
in the universe that snores that loud.

39:47.080 --> 39:51.608
- Scorch! Scorch! Wake up!

39:52.720 --> 39:54.961
Space hero test today. Didn't study.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.642
- What the...?

39:58.800 --> 40:02.009
Needs a whole salad to sleep.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.724
Ow! Huh? Gary? Hey, Gary!
What are you doing here?

40:06.920 --> 40:09.048
I'm here to rescue you.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.931
You're rescuing me?
I'm still dreaming.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.763
I come 15 light-years
out of my comfort zone to save you,

40:16.920 --> 40:19.207
and this is the thanks I get
from my own brother?

40:19.360 --> 40:21.408
Try ex-boss. I fired you.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.329
No, I quit.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.000
And your first mission without me,
you wind up in jail.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.845
- And where did you end up? Jail.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.411
You two should make an appointment.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.928
<i>Attention, aliens. Lunch
is now being served in the cafeteria.</i>

40:34.080 --> 40:39.041
<i>Please be mindful of the joes
as they are unusually sloppy.</i>

40:42.800 --> 40:45.371
The launch station computer
will tell us where Daddy is.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.807
Locate Rescue Pod 13.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.641
<i>Self-destruct
initiated at 2900 hours.</i>

40:51.760 --> 40:53.888
- What?
- Self-destruct?

40:54.040 --> 40:55.724
Play back in-flight camera.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.281
<i>You're a rescue pod!
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.</i>

40:58.440 --> 40:59.441
<i>This is ridiculous!</i>

40:59.640 --> 41:00.801
Dad!

41:00.960 --> 41:05.204
Only Mission Control can destroy a ship.
Somebody here had to give that order.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.449
- Huh?
- Quick, get down.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.289
Lena.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.010
Keep still.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.931
OK, that's good.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.726
- Hurry up and get it loaded.
- You got it, boss.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.800
That much Blubonium
could blow up the whole galaxy.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.889
- Cool.
- No, no, no, not cool.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.407
Very, very not cool.
We have to tell somebody.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.642
- Tell somebody what?

41:34.840 --> 41:36.569
Lena!

41:36.760 --> 41:37.761
Run!

41:38.400 --> 41:40.164
- Go, Kipper!
- Hey!

41:40.320 --> 41:42.561
Let me go!

41:47.320 --> 41:49.527
Hey!

41:49.680 --> 41:53.207
I gave you a chance to go home, sweetie.
You should've taken it.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.561
Little rat got away.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.529
It doesn't matter,
he's just a kid.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.889
- Tie her up and bring her with us.
- Wait! What about Gary?

42:00.040 --> 42:05.570
Gary? That coward?
He's never coming back.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.046
Thank you.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.282
Hit me with some jiggly cubes.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.486
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

42:14.640 --> 42:17.086
Hi, guys. Not sure
if you guys are guys.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.129
Or ladies. Either way, no problem.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.925
Those are the Greys.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.321
No one knows what Shank has got on them,
but they do his bidding.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.921
So don't get on their bad side,
understand?

42:27.080 --> 42:28.445
What's up, eggheads?

42:28.600 --> 42:31.524
Give me two of everything
and one more of anything.

42:35.560 --> 42:38.609
Hey!
Some things you just can't teach.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.688
Uh, mmm...
What are... what is all this?

42:41.840 --> 42:44.320
We have lots of alien delicacies.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.562
<i>Blorm, Phrebbish, Zumft,</i> diet <i>Zumft,</i>

42:46.720 --> 42:48.768
free-range <i>Zumft,</i>
non-dairy gluten-free <i>Zumft.</i>

42:48.960 --> 42:51.725
And if you're looking for something
a bit more refined,

42:51.920 --> 42:53.524
we got fresh <i>plarbe.</i>

42:53.680 --> 42:55.170
Oh, hello.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.651
Hi.

42:56.840 --> 42:59.002
You know what? I'm not hungry.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.321
- Oh. Uh...

43:01.480 --> 43:03.130
- Aliens.
- After you.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.124
Gary!
I've seen a lot of jailbreak movies.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.601
All we need to break out of here
is a diversion,

43:08.760 --> 43:11.286
a shovel and a blowup dummy
of ourselves.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.482
It's not that simple, Scorch.
Don't be reckless.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.921
And from now on,
let's whisper our escape plan.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.371
That's your problem, Gary.

43:17.520 --> 43:20.444
Always wishy-washy, never taking action.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.762
That's what makes me the heroic brother.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.570
You're some hero.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.846
Without me, you're nothing.

43:26.040 --> 43:29.283
Ooh, big words
from a computer-loving mama's boy.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.568
No, they're regular-sized words.

43:31.720 --> 43:34.200
You're just too dumb to understand.

43:34.360 --> 43:38.285
Good thing Kip's gonna be a hero
like me, not a coward like you.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.568
Ugh! You take that back!

43:40.880 --> 43:44.680
Oh! Nice, Gary. Nice. Real mature.

43:44.840 --> 43:45.966
- Whoa!

43:50.840 --> 43:53.684
- Oh! Right in the kisser!
- Food fight!

43:53.840 --> 43:55.968
We have a food-related disturbance
in the cafeteria!

43:57.440 --> 44:00.330
- Get him!
- Stop! Get back here!

44:00.480 --> 44:03.051
- Come here, you little runt!

44:03.800 --> 44:06.087
- How the tables have turned.
- Hey!

44:09.840 --> 44:11.524
Well, that was lucky.

44:12.200 --> 44:15.329
Stop this right now
before somebody gets hurt.

44:15.880 --> 44:17.644
All right, that's it.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.569
- Bull's-eye!

44:20.120 --> 44:22.043
Oh, it's on!

44:23.000 --> 44:25.844
- Ugh! Now you've done it.
- Bruce, look out!

44:26.000 --> 44:29.243
- Willis, run!

44:29.400 --> 44:31.402
People, people, where are your manners?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.967
You're the one talking
with your mouth full of yourself.

44:38.640 --> 44:39.971
Do you have to do that now?

44:40.120 --> 44:42.282
Hey, practice makes perfect.

44:43.760 --> 44:45.603
George! Lucas! Let's go!

44:45.760 --> 44:47.250
- It's the fuzz!
- Get 'em!

44:47.400 --> 44:50.609
Christopher! Nolan! On your feet!

44:51.480 --> 44:53.244
Hello, my dear.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.687
- Oh!
- Stop right there!

44:58.280 --> 45:00.362
How dare you slap a commanding officer!

45:00.520 --> 45:02.329
- Ah!

45:03.200 --> 45:04.440
All right, alien...

45:04.600 --> 45:07.331
- Scorch, behind you!

45:07.720 --> 45:09.449
- Nice!
- Thank you.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.163
- Guess who!

45:16.960 --> 45:18.200
Let's get outta here.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.651
Oh, yeah!

45:24.520 --> 45:25.885
Ten-hut!

45:26.040 --> 45:28.122
I'm king of the world!

45:29.640 --> 45:30.801
You missed.

45:31.400 --> 45:35.450
Ooh. I told these guys, "You'd
better not food fight," but they did.

45:36.840 --> 45:38.444
I'm gonna sweep this up.

45:39.760 --> 45:42.286
Report to the peace shield,
on the double.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.010
This is the peace shield.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.208
It's an asteroid gun.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.488
Nothing says peace
like a giant gun, huh?

45:48.680 --> 45:49.966
It's overkill if you ask me.

45:50.120 --> 45:53.249
But it's America.
They supersize everything.

45:53.400 --> 45:54.890
You guys built this thing?

45:55.040 --> 45:56.769
Took us almost ten years.

45:56.920 --> 45:59.844
Now we're just waiting
for one last piece: the power source.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.367
Then we can go back to our home planets.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.488
- Or sun.
- Or sun.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.961
Seriously? You live on the sun?

46:07.160 --> 46:09.401
Yep. You can't beat the weather.

46:09.560 --> 46:12.928
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, even though you didn't
work on it, you've gotta sign the floor.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.770
Anything for a fan.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.007
That's a lot of names.
Where are all those guys?

46:19.160 --> 46:22.846
Shanker's been building this thing
for years. He probably let 'em go.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.323
- Get your hands off me.

46:28.760 --> 46:31.525
- You'll never get away with this.

46:31.720 --> 46:34.929
The beauty of it is, I already have.

46:35.760 --> 46:39.162
With Scorch and Gary gone,
who's gonna stop me?

46:39.320 --> 46:40.401
Hi-yah!

46:40.560 --> 46:43.211
- What the...?
- Time to take out the trash!

46:44.160 --> 46:47.050
- Kipper, no!
- Scorch me, baby!

46:48.440 --> 46:50.090
Come back here!

46:57.320 --> 47:01.882
- Let my mom go!
- "Scorch me, baby."

47:03.080 --> 47:06.368
- You monster!
- Aw, I wish I had my camera.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.251
What a perfect family portrait.

47:11.840 --> 47:14.081
Look alive! General's coming in hot!

47:14.240 --> 47:15.890
Shh. Don't do anything stupid.

47:16.040 --> 47:22.002
Soldiers of Area 51, the final
piece of the puzzle has arrived.

47:22.160 --> 47:25.369
That's a Blubonium reactor.
How did he get his hands on it?

47:25.520 --> 47:27.682
Somebody smuggled that thing in my suit.

47:27.840 --> 47:28.841
What's the big deal?

47:29.000 --> 47:31.685
Do you have any idea
how powerful that stuff is?

47:31.840 --> 47:33.888
Prepare for test firing.

47:34.080 --> 47:36.242
- You heard the man!
- Go! Go! Go!

47:46.560 --> 47:49.803
My old friend, Halley's Comet.

47:49.960 --> 47:52.440
Not back for another 50 years.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.120
So... who's gonna miss it?

47:55.280 --> 47:56.680
<i>Targeting Halley's Comet.</i>

47:56.720 --> 47:59.724
<i>Preparing condolence card
for Halley's family.</i>

48:04.640 --> 48:06.847
<i>Target acquired.</i>

48:07.440 --> 48:10.410
<i>Hasta la vista, Halley.</i>

48:25.320 --> 48:26.845
- Yeah, baby! It works!

48:27.000 --> 48:28.365
We're going home!

48:28.800 --> 48:30.086
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

48:30.240 --> 48:31.366
Hot diggity!

48:31.520 --> 48:33.409
- This is not good.
- Oh, yeah!

48:33.560 --> 48:34.641
Boom!

48:36.200 --> 48:39.329
Come on, guys, lighten up.
It's party time!

48:39.520 --> 48:41.249
Get down with your bad self!

48:41.400 --> 48:43.971
There's enough Blubonium
in that thing to blow up a planet.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.487
Well, are we gonna sit around
"Garying" this to death

48:46.640 --> 48:48.722
or are we gonna
do something about it? Ha-ha!

48:48.880 --> 48:51.360
- Scorch!

48:53.040 --> 48:55.486
- Are you nuts?
- Put that down, now!

48:55.640 --> 48:56.721
Get him!

48:58.360 --> 48:59.407
- Ha!

48:59.560 --> 49:01.369
- You're going down!

49:01.520 --> 49:04.922
- James, Cameron, get the alien!
- Scorch me, baby.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.730
Brace yourself, boys!

49:06.920 --> 49:08.251
Stop him!

49:09.840 --> 49:11.922
He's walking all over you.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.124
Stop him!

49:19.120 --> 49:20.804
How you like me now?

49:22.240 --> 49:25.289
- No! My reactor!

49:25.480 --> 49:26.970
Whoa!

49:27.120 --> 49:28.406
Get him out of here!

49:28.560 --> 49:30.528
- No, stop!
- Gary, stay out of this!

49:30.680 --> 49:32.409
Bring the little one, too.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.606
You got him right
where you want him, Gary!

49:37.760 --> 49:42.368
If you can't fix that reactor,
nobody's going home. Ever.

49:44.800 --> 49:48.247
His quiet anger is even angrier
than his loud one.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.084
Uh-huh.

49:52.200 --> 49:56.683
You useless blue moron.
Do you realize what you've done?

49:56.840 --> 50:00.686
I saved millions of innocent aliens,
'cause that's what heroes do.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.650
You failed at your evil plans,
'cause that's what villains do.

50:03.800 --> 50:07.168
And this crumb got stuck on my face,
'cause that's what crumbs do.

50:07.320 --> 50:09.402
- Scorch.
- It's OK, Gary.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.361
Do what you want with me.
I'll never help you.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.090
I thought you might say that.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.770
Whoa!

50:17.720 --> 50:19.802
Scorch! No!

50:26.240 --> 50:28.561
- Any last words?
- Yes.

50:28.720 --> 50:32.611
Friends, aliens, countrymen,
lend me your tentacles.

50:32.800 --> 50:34.529
Don't think of me as a hero.

50:34.680 --> 50:38.162
Think of me as a guy who acted
heroically while full of heroism.

50:38.320 --> 50:39.731
Have you been practicing this?

50:39.880 --> 50:42.406
Gary, tell Gabby I love her.

50:42.600 --> 50:44.682
Tell my fans I love them.

50:44.840 --> 50:47.280
Just as a general rule, if anyone asks,
tell them I love them.

50:47.360 --> 50:50.045
Hey, Gary, I love you too,
little brother.

50:50.200 --> 50:53.044
- Goodbye, cruel galaxy.
- No!

50:54.800 --> 50:57.565
Huh. Well, looks like
I've got time for a few more.

50:57.720 --> 51:00.485
Tell the guy that waxes my ship...
what's his name again?

51:00.640 --> 51:02.130
It doesn't matter.
Just tell him that I love him.

51:02.280 --> 51:03.930
And the people at Dark Planet Cola,

51:04.120 --> 51:07.090
- tell them I love them.
- Stop. We get it.

51:07.240 --> 51:10.767
No. Stop! I'm a BASA engineer.
I can fix the Blubonium.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.720
Don't help him, Gary!
We did the right thing!

51:14.000 --> 51:16.480
- No!

51:19.240 --> 51:23.404
- No! Scorch! Let him go!

51:23.600 --> 51:25.489
As soon as you fix my peace shield.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.170
Oh, and one more thing.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.245
If you tell any of the others
about this, I'll freeze you all!

51:34.840 --> 51:36.569
- Get in there, alien.

51:39.800 --> 51:44.601
You got some nerve
walking in here after that stunt.

51:44.760 --> 51:47.240
- I...

51:47.400 --> 51:49.767
- Where's your brother?
- Shanker's got him.

51:49.960 --> 51:53.089
- Why'd he let you go?
- Because he thinks I can fix it.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.528
- Can you fix it?
- Of course. I'm a BASA engineer.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.001
Oh, thank goodness.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.925
- But I don't think I should.
- Say what?

52:03.360 --> 52:07.331
- I fix it, we all go home, right?
- Exactly. What's wrong with that?

52:07.520 --> 52:11.491
Shanker ends up with the most
powerful weapon in the universe.

52:11.640 --> 52:14.928
So he's got a toy for shooting
down asteroids. Big deal.

52:15.080 --> 52:18.050
You saw what it can do.
Who knows what he'll blow up next.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.247
What if it's your planet?

52:19.400 --> 52:23.086
Don't be paranoid, Gary.
It happens to smart people all the time.

52:23.280 --> 52:26.250
You start thinking too much
and it gets the best of you.

52:26.400 --> 52:29.882
You guys
actually trust Shanker?

52:30.080 --> 52:33.050
- We're kinda low on options here, Gary.
- What choice do we have?

52:33.720 --> 52:35.131
We refuse to fix it.

52:35.280 --> 52:38.284
Then what? Stage a silent protest?
Come on, man!

52:38.440 --> 52:40.488
You want us to be stuck in here forever?

52:40.640 --> 52:43.769
I don't know what to do, OK? Just let me
sit down for a second and think!

52:44.640 --> 52:47.564
You mean sit around and do nothing.

52:49.560 --> 52:53.451
Well, we're gonna try to fix it.
Are you coming or not?

52:55.680 --> 52:58.763
You know what? We don't need you.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.649
Come on, Thurman.

53:09.800 --> 53:13.691
- Cut the red wire.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.205
No, no, no! Cut the green wire.

53:15.360 --> 53:19.684
- Scratch that. I'm colorblind.
- Quiet! I need to concentrate.

53:19.880 --> 53:22.884
My third eye, it's messing me up.
I can't do it!

53:23.040 --> 53:25.202
So that's it? Game over?

53:27.400 --> 53:30.404
Step away from the Blubonium.

53:30.600 --> 53:34.047
My man!
Thurman, you're fired.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.404
You sure you know what you're doing?

53:39.560 --> 53:43.087
I scored a 12.0
on my galactic engineering exams.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.884
Do you know what that means?

53:45.680 --> 53:48.160
You had no friends in high school?

53:48.320 --> 53:53.042
It means in a galaxy filled with nerds,
I'm their king.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.091
I hope this works.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.811
We're going home!
It's time to pay my parking tickets!

54:40.000 --> 54:43.163
Uh, Gary? Is that normal?

54:43.320 --> 54:46.130
- Come on, Thurman, don't be paranoid.
- OK.

54:46.280 --> 54:50.444
- Whoa!
- Gary! Gary! Gary...!

54:50.640 --> 54:52.529
Speech, Gary!

54:53.040 --> 54:55.361
Pack your stuff and be ready to go.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.722
I'm going to get my brother back.

54:59.840 --> 55:03.003
- This one was asking for you, sir.
- Leave him with me.

55:06.080 --> 55:07.525
I'm here for my brother.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.331
Ah, Gary... finally a team player.

55:10.480 --> 55:13.245
I did what you asked.
I fixed the reactor.

55:13.400 --> 55:15.129
And just in time.

55:15.280 --> 55:18.363
Imagine how powerful I'll be
with all this Blubonium.

55:18.520 --> 55:21.967
- What? How did you...?
- You call yourself intelligent life.

55:22.120 --> 55:25.249
These are fun.

55:25.400 --> 55:27.767
- I could do that all day.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.320
Let us go! You got what you wanted!

55:29.440 --> 55:32.728
Why let you go now,
only to hunt you down later?

55:32.880 --> 55:35.406
Hunt us down?
But we come in peace.

55:35.600 --> 55:36.840
Nobody comes in peace.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.243
I was six years old
when they took my father from me.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.525
Think about this, champ.

55:43.680 --> 55:47.446
With that many stars out there,
there just has to be intelligent life.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.968
- Golly! Can I have a look, Pops?
- In a minute, son.

55:51.160 --> 55:53.162
What? What is that?

55:53.320 --> 55:55.926
Good gravy! It's a UFO!

56:01.040 --> 56:03.884
Son, you wouldn't believe it!

56:04.040 --> 56:06.361
This is the moment
I've been waiting for my entire...

56:09.840 --> 56:11.251
No!

56:13.240 --> 56:14.924
Before you join your brother,

56:15.080 --> 56:17.606
there's one last thing
I'd like to show you.

56:21.760 --> 56:23.171
Hey, don't ask, don't tell.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.970
Not the hair, you idiot.

56:27.720 --> 56:30.007
- Lena!
<i>- Ugh. Hello, Gary.</i>

56:30.160 --> 56:32.288
<i>I see you've met my fiancé.</i>

56:32.440 --> 56:34.204
- Fiancé?
- We met online.

56:34.360 --> 56:35.407
Get with the times, Gary.

56:36.520 --> 56:39.410
<i>Your whole family has been
meddling in my business.</i>

56:39.560 --> 56:43.724
- Time to say goodbye, Gary.
- Kip! Kira!

56:44.480 --> 56:48.451
- Lena, please, he's using you.
- He's using all of us.

56:48.600 --> 56:50.887
OK, he's just jealous
he couldn't have you.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.280
<i>- Hmm?</i>
- Ta-ta.

56:52.440 --> 56:55.444
- How could you do this?

56:55.640 --> 56:57.404
You think I'm actually
in love with an alien?

56:57.600 --> 57:01.286
When she leaves your planet with
my Blubonium, I'm gonna blow it up.

57:01.480 --> 57:03.767
- But Baab's just the beginning.

57:03.920 --> 57:07.766
I'm gonna wipe out the alien infestation
one planet at a time.

57:09.080 --> 57:11.128
If you destroy every planet
with intelligent life,

57:11.320 --> 57:13.971
you'll have no stars left in the sky.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.930
My stargazing days are over.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.448
Let me out!

57:27.600 --> 57:29.841
Hey, congratulations. You're free! Not!

57:30.000 --> 57:33.004
- No, you can't do this!

57:33.160 --> 57:35.447
Please! Let me out of here!

57:45.760 --> 57:49.606
I don't know if you can hear me,
but... I'm sorry.

57:53.240 --> 57:57.450
My plan was to get you out of here,
not end up frozen beside you.

58:02.440 --> 58:06.729
I failed you. I failed my family.

58:07.720 --> 58:09.921
All the planning in the world
doesn't amount to anything

58:10.040 --> 58:11.883
without a hero to make it happen.

58:14.880 --> 58:16.803
I tried, brother!

58:17.800 --> 58:19.040
I'm sorry!

58:24.560 --> 58:25.800
Scorch...

58:34.960 --> 58:38.043
So that's Gary's wife?
How'd he make that happen?

58:38.240 --> 58:39.446
I know. Isn't he all like...

58:41.160 --> 58:44.243
Oh, Kip, I told you to run.
You shouldn't have come back.

58:44.400 --> 58:45.561
I couldn't leave you, Mom.

58:45.720 --> 58:48.724
A Junior Adventurer
never leaves a man behind.

58:48.920 --> 58:50.524
Kipper, this isn't a game.

58:50.680 --> 58:55.004
I know. I'm not a little kid anymore.
That's why I came to rescue you.

58:55.160 --> 58:59.006
And you're very brave,
but now we're both stuck in here.

58:59.160 --> 59:01.845
That's because
I'm not done rescuing you.

59:04.920 --> 59:07.241
Blast tape?
You let them catch you.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.926
Mom, I'm gonna need you to be quiet.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.651
- Kip, be careful.

59:17.720 --> 59:21.167
I can't believe
we're guarding a lady and a kid.

59:21.880 --> 59:24.451
- It's embarrassing.
- Is this a daycare?

59:24.600 --> 59:26.329
- Here goes nothing.

59:28.240 --> 59:29.127
Hey!

59:29.920 --> 59:32.207
Open the door! Open the door!
Hurry up!

59:33.040 --> 59:34.849
Kip, look out!

59:35.000 --> 59:36.081
Uh-oh.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.850
Consider yourselves scorched!

59:44.280 --> 59:46.089
Come on,
we don't have much time.

59:50.480 --> 59:51.970
I've gotta stop that ship.

59:52.120 --> 59:55.169
You go hide in Mission Control
and lock that door behind you.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.486
Copy that!

59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.730
<i>This whole villain thing,
it's not you.</i>

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.281
<i>You know? And the stress is aging you,
if I might be...</i>

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.522
Shut up.
Don't you have a mute button?

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.600
- It's locked.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.681
Our government thinks asteroids
are Earth's biggest threat.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.970
But some of us know better.
The biggest threat to planet Earth?

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.083
- Global warming.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.720
- Aliens.
- Oh.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.329
We will wipe out their planets
before they come for us.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.689
- Our first target? Planet Baab!

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.171
That's Gary's planet!

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.530
<i>Targeting planet Baab.
Target acquired.</i>

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.163
Excuse me, sir?
Sorry to interrupt.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.322
Just wondering approximately
what time you'll be sending us home.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.086
- Is he really this stupid?

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.681
The only place you're going
is the freezer.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.044
Oh! I trust there'll be
no more outbursts?

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.087
- No!

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.644
<i>Danger. System malfunction.</i>

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.041
Why isn't it working?

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.325
Gary?

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.201
No! It's a trap!
Shut it down! Shut it down!

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.681
- No!

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.325
<i>System overload.</i>

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.642
<i>Evacuate! Evacuate!</i>

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.481
<i>Seriously. Get out of here.
Everybody, out!</i>

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.923
<i>Scram. Gotta go. Uh-oh.</i>

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.569
- Ooh!

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.520
- They're off! We're free! Whoo!

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.321
You're all gonna pay for this!
Freeze the aliens!

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.404
Io, get up!
It's time to get mad, girl.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.847
- What about the program?

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.405
Forget the program!

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.129
Tasers to full power!

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.126
- Yeah! Take that!

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.328
That's what you get
when you mess with the Doc!

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.646
- Huh?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.725
Uh, guys?
We might wanna get out of here!

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.567
Scorch!

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.324
Scorch, hey! Come on!

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.962
- Scorch!
Gary?

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.842
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.644
- Huh?
- Are you OK?

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.122
Of course I am.
Nothing can stop Scorch Supernova.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.725
Whoa!

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.891
Ow! I'm having a bit
of a leg situation over here.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.565
You're still thawing out.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.162
Gary, I'm too heavy.
Go! Save yourself.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.641
Scorch, I couldn't.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.849
I'm not serious!
Come on, put some back into it!

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.129
- Get me outta here!

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.967
I'm free!

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.884
- Ooh!
- A Snarkbeast.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.889
Don't worry. They look mean,
but they're completely harmless.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.251
I'm free!

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.571
I'm not free.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.609
Uh... Maybe I'm thinking
of something else.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.009
- Oh, dear.
- Yummy!

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.329
- Oh, no!
- I don't think so.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.051
Got outta that place!
I'm starving here!

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.124
- Let me go!

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.400
Oy vey.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.841
- Io!

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.925
Come on, now, you saved us.
We couldn't leave you behind.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.969
Us aliens gotta stick together.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.648
Whoa! Hello, talking rat.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.609
Why you gotta disrespect me like that?

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.240
Gary, I could kiss your brain!

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.846
Destabilizing the Blubonium
was brilliant.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.128
I taught him everything he knows.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.407
He's still frozen. Grab a leg.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.881
I'm covered in slime. I can't do this!

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.451
<i>Come on!</i>

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.965
They're heading for the elevator.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.122
- Locking it down.
- Leave them.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.850
They're sitting ducks in there.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.810
Alpha Team,
they're headed your way.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.850
Copy that, sir. All right, boys,
set your freezers to ice cold!

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.206
Move! Move! Move!

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.524
So, Gary, what's the plan
when we reach the top?

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.842
Uh, just give me a second,
let me think.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.843
You'd better think fast.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.771
Here we go.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.165
- Aliens, come out to play.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.561
- Hmm?
- Huh?

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.721
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.400
- I don't see 'em!
- They're not there!

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.327
They're gone. Huh?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.051
- Now!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.247
Freeze 'em!

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.845
- Get 'em!
- Fire!

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.331
- Oh! Oh!
- There he goes!

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.925
- Find him! Find him!
- I'm out!

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.321
I can't believe you talked me into this!

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.766
- Shoot him!
- Don't freeze up out...

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.969
Hey, Gary, check it out!
The freezing wore off!

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.929
Aw, come on!

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.325
Huh?

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.320
Whoo! Did you see that? I am the man!

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.200
- My lips!
- Come on, come on, let's go!

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.609
Ouch! My lips got stuck!

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.769
It's a simple binary lock circuit.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.122
I'll just reconnect
the main IC control switch...

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.089
Haven't I taught you anything?

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.486
- Got it.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.764
- Yes!
- Freedom!

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.685
- Nice work, brother.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.727
- Scorch, where's the ship?

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.008
Follow me! It's this way!

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.168
Actually, it's this way.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.608
<i>I get it.
Being the villain can be lonely,</i>

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.808
<i>but you're looking for love
in all the wrong places.</i>

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.124
<i>He's using you.
What's wrong with Zane in Sector 113?</i>

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.248
<i>- He's a lovely chap. Just...</i>
- Shut up already!

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.925
Get me Shanker.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.128
<i>What do you want?
I'm kinda busy right now.</i>

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.410
What's going on?
What happened to your hair?

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.806
<i>Those blue idiots you sent
ruined everything.</i>

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.725
- Nothing's ruined.
<i>- This is all your fault.</i>

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.406
<i>If you screw up this delivery,
we're through!</i>

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.126
No! I'll make it up to you, please!

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.523
- Turn this ship around.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.366
Huh?
Kira? What are you doing here?

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.806
Let's go home.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.804
I bet it makes you happy
seeing me like this.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.564
No, of course not.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.610
How could I have been so stupid?

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.762
He used me.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.404
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.082
You're just like Gary.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.211
So innocent. So naive.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.211
Please! Lena, help me!

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.089
It doesn't have to be like this!

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.481
You thought you could stop me,
didn't you?

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.007
Little Miss Housewife saves the day!

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:20.122
You've betrayed your people!
You've betrayed your planet...

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:24.523
...and you're not fit
to wear this uniform!

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.961
What? You think just 'cause a chick
has kids she can't dish it out?

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.326
- Pshh.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:41.165
Computer, reset course to planet Baab.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.206
Hurry up! The ship's down there!

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.249
Whoo!
I gotta lay off the burritos.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.881
I cloaked it as one of their spaceships.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.564
Come on!

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.640
- Sorry!
- Dude, don't you knock?

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:19.488
Hammer, get out here!
You're never gonna believe this!

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.210
Whoa!

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.727
- Awesome.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.805
I'm going! I'm going!
Nope! Two down, a hundred to go.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.291
Scorch, which one is it?

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:32.283
Blue buddy, what's up?

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:34.368
My brother cloaked our ship and lost it.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.131
- Close the door! I'm changing!
- Nope! Ha!

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:39.044
No problem.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.167
- False alarm?
- Yeah.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.727
Tornado!

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.564
- Tornado?
- Out of my way!

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.801
- Take cover!
- Oh, my God!

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.404
- My cooler!

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.640
Come on, quick!

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.646
Aha! There it is!

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.126
Yes!

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.327
Hi, honey! I'm home!

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.684
- Sweet ride!
- There it is!

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.320
Wait! Aren't you going to abduct us?

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.767
Uh, we don't really do that.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.049
- They come in peace.
- Awesome.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.967
- Whoa.
- Fly, blue buddy! Fly!

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.726
- We're going home!
- Yes!

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.564
Gary, I love it!

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.725
Trashing bad guys, flying spaceships,
we might be related after all.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.523
You know, in some strange way,
I'm gonna miss this place.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.887
- I hate this planet!
- We got company!

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.486
- Hang on.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.042
Yee-haw!

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.567
Sweet flying, Gary!
I didn't think you had it in you.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.040
Nobody panic! I mean nobody else!

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.009
I'll panic for all of us.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.168
- Ugh!

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.481
I don't fly well.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:16.010
When I feel queasy, I try
breathing deeply through my nose.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.124
Careful with your warning
shots. Shanker wants 'em alive.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.561
Incoming!

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.251
- Oh, we're hit!
- Oh... no!

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.566
- What's going on?
- The computer's fried!

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.324
- Our steering's gone.
- Oh, no!

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.603
Oh, no! I've seen this in a movie!
It does not end well!

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.524
Mayday! This is <i>Supernova-9!</i>
We're going down!

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.445
<i>Mayday!
I repeat, we're going down!</i>

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.840
<i>- We're a dead stick!</i>
- Huh?

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.684
<i>This is the Supernova-9!</i>

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.650
- What?
<i>- We are going down!</i>

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.040
- Dad?
<i>- Kipper!</i>

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.850
- Yeah, it's me, Dad!
<i>- Where's Mom?</i>

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.281
Put a grown-up on, bud,
we're in trouble.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.245
I'm the only one here, Dad.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.483
Kipper, this is serious.
We're going down.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.130
No, you're not.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.765
Kip, what are you doing?

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.364
<i>Supernova-9,</i> you are go
for remote assistance.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.690
OK, Kip, this is just like
flying your remote control ship.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.411
What? This is nothing like
his remote control ship!

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.688
- Just a little to the left.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.251
Too much left! Too much left!

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.525
We got a student driver?
Every man for himself.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.843
Ah! We're gonna hit that cliff! Pull up!

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.287
Take out their engines.
Let's force 'em to land.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.360
- They're shooting!
- We're not gonna make it!

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.044
I've got this, Dad. Trust me.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.407
Pull up! Pull up!

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.206
- Three...
- Pull up!

01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.725
- Kip?
- ...two...

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.724
- Pull up!

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.723
...one.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.403
Get out! Get out!

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.331
- Yes!
- We made it!

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.404
See ya later, suckers!

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.641
- Yes! Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.450
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.524
Mission Control,
that's some good flying.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.490
- I told you, Dad, I got this.
<i>- Way to go, Kipper.</i>

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.801
Uncle Scorch?

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.122
Everyone is on board and accounted for.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.521
- Hey, guys, say hi to my son.
- Hi!

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.563
- What's up, little man?
- Pleased to meet you.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.411
Dad, there's something
coming up behind you!

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.325
- What?

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.203
Gary,
I'm not finished with you!

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.641
- It's Shanker!

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.404
He's got my mission suit.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.928
I made some modifications.
You like them?

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.003
What's going on?
Why aren't you moving?

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.640
We're caught in a tractor beam.
You've gotta get us out of it!

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.286
It's not working. We're burning up!

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.770
We gotta knock off that tractor beam.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.491
Nice one, Gary.
How do we do that?

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.170
We take it out at the source.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.243
You mean go down there?

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.289
Be logical, Gary. You're asking me
to jump with no chance of survival.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.960
I'm not asking you to do anything.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.603
Gary!

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.242
- He made it!
- Come on, Gary!

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.960
Get your hands off my brother!

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.161
Whoa!

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.091
- Scorch, what are you doing?
- We're a team, brother!

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:02.449
- Don't you remember?
- Aah! Help!

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.802
Hey, pal, we're having a moment here.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.440
- Ow!

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.001
Get your face out of my hand!

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.449
Let go of my hair!

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.889
Hurry up!

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.883
Oh!

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.687
I guess this is it.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.127
We were a good team!

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.201
You know, I always looked up to you.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.324
- You looked up to me?
- I'm serious.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.370
Great wife, great kid.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.330
I always thought
I could do that one day.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.642
You would've been a great dad.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.765
- Hey, uh, Gary?
- Yeah, brother?

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.602
I'm sorry for firing you.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:01.610
Actually, I quit.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.763
Huh? What the...?

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.930
- Gary!
- What...?

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.163
You! Thank you.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.845
Don't mention it.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.724
- You can talk?
- Of course.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.645
- Occasionally.
- From time to time.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.004
Why did you save us?
I thought you worked for General Crazy.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.527
At first, we felt bad
for squishing his dad.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.047
Turns out he was
a psychopathic megalomaniac

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.608
bent on destroying every known form
of intelligent life in the universe.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.410
Who knew?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.085
What are you gonna do with him?

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.811
- Can't say.
- It'll give you nightmares.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.365
Huh?

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.528
You're gonna pay for this.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.968
I thought I told you, we come in peace!

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.129
Ouch! Oh, wow.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.009
- First punch-out?
- Yeah.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.210
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, feels great.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.721
- Whoo-hoo!
- Uh-huh!

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.803
That was amazing!
I would've jumped, too,

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.962
but it looked like you guys
had everything under control.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.929
This little guy's great.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.764
- Can we keep him?
- Put me down!

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.681
- Let's go home.
- Whoo-hoo!

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.571
- All right!

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.842
Ah, it's good to be home.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.048
Mission Control, bring us in.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.680
<i>Check your six, Supernova-Q.</i>

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.930
- Hiya, honey!
- Kira? How did you...?

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.604
That's my wife!

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.206
Oh, Gary, how'd you hook that up?

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.840
I always thought you were a little...

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.331
What does that mean?
Everybody always says that.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.687
- Beats me.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.320
<i>I've come to expect
the unexpected working with Scorch,</i>

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.400
<i>but I don't think anything
could have prepared me</i>

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.647
<i>for working with my family
to save our planet.</i>

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.164
<i>I guess life's pretty
unpredictable after all.</i>

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.928
- Yay, Scorch, you're the best!

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.048
You're so awesome!

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.089
- Yay, Scorch!

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.164
I love you, planet Baab!

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.209
- Yeah, Scorch!
- Yes!

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.324
- Way to go, Scorch!
- You saved us!

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.643
No more hero stuff
for a while, OK?

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.770
Are you kidding?
I'm never leaving the house again.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.010
- Dad!
- We love you, buddy!

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.770
Kipper!

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.127
Kipper, that was amazing.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.930
We're so proud of you, bud.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.323
You were awesome out there,
just like your uncle.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.847
You are gonna be
a great astronaut one day.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.684
Maybe even as good as me.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.928
Thanks, Uncle Scorch.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.087
But I'm more of a mission controller.

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.730
Like my dad.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.041
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN, coming through!

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.601
Oh, it's good to see you!

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.164
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.728
Tell us what it's like to be
the greatest hero in the universe.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.564
You're gonna have to ask him yourself.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.611
Give it up for my little brother,
Gary Supernova!

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.730
Hey, I'm older than him.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.566
- Gary! Gary!
- So Gary, we still a team?

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.770
Somebody's gotta
watch your back. Little brother.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.400
<i>That's my brother, Scorch.
He's in trouble, again.</i>

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.164
<i>Seventy-two hours later,</i>

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.164
<i>he was on the most
terrifying mission of his life.</i>

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.766
Scorch, do you copy?

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.047
Yeah, brother. I'm scared to move.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.041
Remember your training.
You can do this.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.000
- I'm not gonna make it, Gary.
- Don't say that.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.327
I'll be by your side
every step of the way.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.164
My wingman?

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.445
Your best man.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.770
And do you, Scorch Supernova,

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.123
take Gabby Babblebrock
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.284
- to have and to hold...
- Oh, lo, are you crying?

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.841
No, I just got something in my eye.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.604
Let's never break up, guys.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.001
And do you, Gabby Babblebrock,
take Scorch Supernova

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.686
- to be your lawfully wedded husband?
- I do.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.162
And so, by the power vested in me

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.250
by the Intergalactic Association
of Radio Talk Show Therapists,

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.086
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.930
You may kiss the bride.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.963
Aww!

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.249
Let's party!

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.201
- Hey, Scorch, way to go, man!
- Hey, thanks for coming.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.526
Yeah!

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:14.121
No! You're OK!

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.884
I can't believe you made it!

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.963
Nice to meet you.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.808
Here we go again.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.042
Yeah! That's it, that's it!

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.328
Oh! Oh, yeah!

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.209
Come on, Gary.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.971
Well, this is humiliating.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.565
<i>You know, you don't have
to travel millions of light-years</i>

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.927
<i>and defeat a deadly intergalactic enemy</i>

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.045
<i>to find out that the greatest story of
all is right here on your home planet,</i>

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.521
<i>with your brother, and your own family.</i>

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.683
Love you guys!
