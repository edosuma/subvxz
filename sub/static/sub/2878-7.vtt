WEBVTT

00:01.804 --> 00:06.764
And reverse the spin
on the antiproton...

00:06.765 --> 00:10.684
and gamma becomes alpha...

00:10.686 --> 00:15.856
Multiplied by a matrix
of negative I comma zero...

00:15.858 --> 00:17.140
And there we have it.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.894
Conclusive proof that I am
absolutely worthless

00:20.896 --> 00:22.646
after 9:00.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.485
Sheldon...

00:30.121 --> 00:32.689
Sheldon...

00:39.714 --> 00:42.699
Hmm.

00:48.472 --> 00:52.309
All right, all right.

00:52.311 --> 00:54.060
I see what's going on.

00:54.062 --> 00:57.898
A little pre-Halloween
hijinkery.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.023
A ghostly moan,

01:07.025 --> 01:09.075
a rattling of chains,

01:09.077 --> 01:11.027
a witch's cackle.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.731
The trifecta
of haunted house clichés.

01:14.733 --> 01:18.118
Instead of "Eek,"
I say, "Yawn."

01:20.204 --> 01:24.124
Sheldon...

01:26.744 --> 01:29.429
Oh, the walls
are dripping blood,

01:29.431 --> 01:33.099
which looks nothing like
a phenolphthalein indicator

01:33.101 --> 01:36.353
exposed to a sodium carbonate
solution.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.092
"See you in hell Sheldon."

01:42.094 --> 01:46.646
The most frightening thing about
that is the missing comma.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.151
Ah.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.820
Okay, all right.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.122
That one was clever.

01:56.124 --> 01:59.659
Skeleton with phosphorous
on a zip line.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.445
Come on out,
merry pranksters.

02:02.447 --> 02:04.614
Take a bow.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.252
You should've seen your face.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.555
Yes, there's
nothing quite like

02:12.557 --> 02:16.626
the slightly widened eyes
of mildly startled.

02:16.628 --> 02:18.645
Come on, admit it.
We got you, Sheldon.

02:18.647 --> 02:22.799
Please, fright depends
on an element of surprise.

02:22.801 --> 02:23.850
The simple fact is,

02:23.852 --> 02:26.102
because I am much smarter
than you,

02:26.104 --> 02:29.906
and able to anticipate your
actions, it is highly unlikely

02:29.908 --> 02:33.777
that you two rubes
could ever surprise me.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.161
He's probably right.

02:35.163 --> 02:37.197
We can't beat him.
He's just too smart.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.199
Gentlemen.

02:44.656 --> 02:46.823
Who had money
on "faints"?

02:46.825 --> 02:48.091
I had "pee his pants."

02:48.093 --> 02:49.626
Hang on.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.344

03:17.748 --> 03:19.263
Oh. Watch out, Sheldon.

03:19.264 --> 03:22.516
This little boy Casper
is a g-g-g-ghost!

03:22.518 --> 03:24.734
Droll.

03:24.736 --> 03:27.070
Not as droll as a grown man

03:27.072 --> 03:29.322
passed out in a puddle
of his own urine.

03:29.324 --> 03:31.825
That was pretty droll.

03:31.827 --> 03:33.360
With a hint of ammonia.

03:35.863 --> 03:37.697
Yes, enjoy your japes,
gentlemen.

03:37.699 --> 03:40.500
You think you've poked fun
at a milquetoast academic.

03:40.502 --> 03:42.102
Well, you've forgotten
one thing:

03:42.104 --> 03:45.005
I am also a son
of the Lone Star state.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.456
I'm Texas through and through.

03:46.458 --> 03:49.876
And we know how to settle
scores down there.

03:49.878 --> 03:53.530
If you doubt me, ask Mexico.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.835
Hot girl, nine o'clock.

03:58.837 --> 04:01.788
Don't everybody look at once!

04:03.507 --> 04:05.392
What is she doing
in a comic book store?

04:05.394 --> 04:08.695
I don't know, she might be lost.

04:09.864 --> 04:13.733
Doesn't matter. Watch and learn.

04:17.988 --> 04:20.457
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:23.211 --> 04:26.046
Um... it-it-it...

04:32.403 --> 04:34.304
Shut up.

04:36.390 --> 04:37.757
Are you getting
this <i>Next Men?</i>

04:37.759 --> 04:39.726
Uh, yeah. It's
issue number 21.

04:39.728 --> 04:40.894
First appearance of Hellboy.

04:40.896 --> 04:43.563
I know. I've been
looking for it for years.

04:43.565 --> 04:44.720
Sorry.

04:44.745 --> 04:46.692
Hey, if I pretended
to hit on you,

04:46.718 --> 04:49.352
could I distract you
enough to sneak it away?

04:50.821 --> 04:54.190
Yes, but you'd be using
your superpowers for evil.

04:54.192 --> 04:58.495
Damn, I'm forbidden by my
Kryptonian father to do so.

04:59.196 --> 05:00.447
I'm Alice.

05:00.449 --> 05:01.831
Leonard.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.450
You're very cute, Leonard.

05:03.452 --> 05:05.919
Thanks. You, too. You know,
go ahead and take it.

05:07.088 --> 05:10.040
No, no. No, no,
I-I did evil.

05:10.691 --> 05:12.092
Would you be open
to a trade?

05:12.094 --> 05:13.960
Uh, yeah, yeah,
sure, I guess.

05:13.962 --> 05:16.129
Okay. Here.

05:16.131 --> 05:17.347
This is my number.

05:17.349 --> 05:18.765
Call me.

05:18.767 --> 05:21.250
Sorry, palm's a little sweaty.

05:21.252 --> 05:22.435
What's that word?

05:22.437 --> 05:25.421
- Alice.
- Oh, right, your name.

05:25.423 --> 05:27.924
That makes more
sense than "penis."

05:27.926 --> 05:30.093
Later.

05:33.447 --> 05:36.366
Did we just see you pick up
a girl in a comic book store?

05:36.368 --> 05:38.485
'Cause if you did, you get
your picture up there

05:38.487 --> 05:40.287
on the Wall of Heroes.

05:40.289 --> 05:42.438
No, I don't think
I picked her up.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.823
Besides, I have a girlfriend.

05:43.825 --> 05:46.209
Doesn't matter. This is the
closest anyone's ever come.

05:46.211 --> 05:48.295
You're going on
the wall, my friend.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.417
Be sure to check the mail.

05:54.419 --> 05:56.970
How many times are you gonna
tell me? What's with you?

05:56.972 --> 06:00.006
Nothing. It's not suspicious
that I'm fixating.

06:00.008 --> 06:01.591
It's consistent with
my personality.

06:01.593 --> 06:03.510
Right.

06:03.512 --> 06:04.561
Hey, guys.

06:04.563 --> 06:05.729
More Halloween candy?

06:05.731 --> 06:07.847
Didn't you just buy
a bunch of it yesterday?

06:07.849 --> 06:09.733
Oh. Yeah.
That's gone.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.687
It's a rough month when
Halloween and PMS

06:13.689 --> 06:15.689
hit at the same time.

06:16.991 --> 06:18.858
Leonard doesn't have time
to chat, he has to get the mail.

06:18.860 --> 06:21.811
Will you relax?
I'll get it in a minute.

06:21.813 --> 06:24.030
- How was work?
- Open the mail!

06:24.832 --> 06:26.282
Excuse me.

06:33.490 --> 06:36.876
A couple of circulars,
nothing important.

06:36.878 --> 06:39.512
- What's with him?
- Hang on.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:49.523 --> 06:52.559
You might be from Texas,
but I'm from New Jersey.

06:57.031 --> 06:58.398
Check it out.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.349
Jim Lee drew this
of me two years ago

07:00.351 --> 07:02.652
at Comic Con.

07:02.654 --> 07:03.903
What are you wearing?

07:03.905 --> 07:05.655
Well, you know,
it's Comic Con.

07:07.875 --> 07:11.061
I'm Lion-O from
<i>ThunderCats.</i>

07:11.063 --> 07:13.913
Wow, you must have
gotten so laid.

07:13.915 --> 07:17.533
No. But Jessica Alba
did rub my furry belly.

07:19.370 --> 07:22.538
Want to see a comic I draw?

07:22.540 --> 07:24.474
You're kidding.
You have your own book?

07:24.476 --> 07:27.010
Yeah. It's kinda
based on my life.

07:27.012 --> 07:28.228
Cool.

07:29.847 --> 07:31.097
Oh, look.

07:31.099 --> 07:33.266
That's you having
sex with a guy

07:33.268 --> 07:35.518
in the top half of
a Chewbacca costume.

07:37.605 --> 07:38.855
Comic Con?

07:38.857 --> 07:41.157
You'd think, but no.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.195
You're very talented.
This is really good.

07:45.197 --> 07:46.529
Did you do...

07:51.585 --> 07:55.371
So, can I trade you
my comic for the Hellboy?

07:55.373 --> 07:57.674
You can have my car.

08:12.973 --> 08:15.191
Oh, dear.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.145
Oh, dear...

08:19.147 --> 08:22.148
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.950
Oh, dear... oh, dear.

08:23.952 --> 08:25.768
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

08:25.770 --> 08:29.038
Purell, Purell,
Purell, Purell.

08:44.305 --> 08:46.556
Good morning, Sheldon.

08:46.558 --> 08:48.808
It is, isn't it?

08:56.134 --> 08:57.484
Oh, bother.

08:57.486 --> 08:59.969
Isn't that just
always the way?

08:59.971 --> 09:02.739
You go to staple something,
and you're out of staples.

09:02.741 --> 09:05.141
Gosh, I wish I'd known
that earlier today

09:05.143 --> 09:07.410
when I was at Staples.

09:07.412 --> 09:10.196
You have a thing of paper clips
right there.

09:10.198 --> 09:15.084
No, no, I need something more
permanent to join these papers.

09:15.086 --> 09:19.622
Say, don't you keep staples
in your top desk drawer?

09:19.624 --> 09:21.758
I don't know. Maybe.

09:22.476 --> 09:24.627
Be a lamb and check.

09:24.629 --> 09:26.963
All right.

09:30.551 --> 09:32.719
Who do we have here?

09:34.471 --> 09:37.190
It's a snake.
A terrifying snake.

09:37.192 --> 09:42.128
Oh, did some bad man
put us in a drawer?

09:42.130 --> 09:43.947
Stop talking like that.

09:43.949 --> 09:46.449
You've been rendered
speechless by fear.

09:46.451 --> 09:52.038
Let's go to the biology lab and
find you some nice yummy mice.

09:53.791 --> 09:57.043
I tried to scare an Indian
with a snake.

09:58.195 --> 10:00.380
Come on, Cooper.
You're better than this.

10:04.535 --> 10:06.953
It's open.

10:08.122 --> 10:09.289
Hey, you got a minute?

10:09.291 --> 10:10.607
Yeah, sure, come on in.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.492
Thanks.

10:12.494 --> 10:13.877
Want some mac and cheese?

10:13.879 --> 10:16.997
No. Lactose. Gas.

10:16.999 --> 10:20.801
- Glass of wine?
- No. Sulfites. Migraines.

10:20.803 --> 10:22.719
Okay, well, I'd offer
you Halloween candy,

10:22.721 --> 10:24.504
but that's gone.

10:25.306 --> 10:26.590
So, what's up?

10:26.592 --> 10:28.759
Okay, we used to go out, right?

10:28.761 --> 10:31.945
Oh, my God, that's
where I know you from.

10:33.380 --> 10:37.217
I'm dealing with a situation and
it's kind of about my love life,

10:37.219 --> 10:39.903
so I know that might be weird
for us to talk about,

10:39.905 --> 10:42.388
but in this area, as you know,
all my other friends

10:42.390 --> 10:44.941
are just so stupid.

10:44.943 --> 10:46.943
All right, what's going on?

10:46.945 --> 10:48.578
So, you're okay
talking about this?

10:48.580 --> 10:50.113
- Yes.
- You're sure it's not weird.

10:50.115 --> 10:51.498
It's okay.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.000
You know what, if you ever want
to talk to me about a problem

10:54.002 --> 10:56.536
in your life with a guy,
then I would be fine with that.

10:56.538 --> 10:58.672
Okay, good, because there's
this one guy I used to date

10:58.674 --> 11:00.340
who's about to be force-fed
wine and cheese

11:00.342 --> 11:02.008
if he doesn't get to the point.

11:02.010 --> 11:04.711
Okay, uh...

11:04.713 --> 11:06.430
here it is.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.915
Is it cheating
if a guy has a girlfriend...

11:08.917 --> 11:10.884
Yeah, probably.

11:12.220 --> 11:13.370
Come on.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.521
I'm sorry, go ahead.

11:14.523 --> 11:16.389
I met this girl,
and she's great.

11:16.391 --> 11:17.891
we have a lot in common.

11:17.893 --> 11:19.192
Did you guys do it?

11:19.194 --> 11:21.278
No. We just made out a little.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.231
Oh, look at you, you bad boy.

11:24.233 --> 11:26.316
Did you tell her
about Priya?

11:26.318 --> 11:28.429
Well, I was gonna, but
there were too many

11:28.454 --> 11:29.654
tongues in my mouth.

11:30.622 --> 11:33.790
That's gross.

11:34.942 --> 11:37.744
Here's the thing,
I-I'm not one of those guys

11:37.746 --> 11:40.914
who sneaks around and sleeps
with more than one woman.

11:40.916 --> 11:42.165
Well, good for you.

11:42.167 --> 11:45.252
The problem is, I want
to be one of those guys.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.839
So sleep with the new girl
and lie to Priya.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.340
Oh, that's not who I am.

11:50.342 --> 11:52.759
All right, then break it off
with the new girl.

11:52.761 --> 11:54.227
Now, let's not do anything rash.

11:54.229 --> 11:56.313
She's really hot.

11:56.315 --> 11:57.848
If you like this girl so much,

11:57.850 --> 11:59.766
why don't you just
end things with Priya?

11:59.768 --> 12:01.234
Priya and I are in love.

12:01.236 --> 12:03.019
I think we could
get married someday.

12:03.021 --> 12:05.906
Leonard, you're looking for
a way to sleep with both women

12:05.908 --> 12:07.774
and have everybody
be happy about it.

12:07.776 --> 12:10.861
Now we're getting somewhere.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.414
What does your gut tell you?

12:14.416 --> 12:17.083
"Go ask Penny;
she'll know what to do."

12:25.826 --> 12:27.377
Hello, Howard.

12:27.379 --> 12:31.464
I've realized that you
scaring me was all in jest.

12:31.466 --> 12:34.634
Allow me to say, job well done.

12:47.149 --> 12:49.950
Perfect.

12:50.985 --> 12:52.886
What are you doing?

12:52.888 --> 12:55.071
Science. You
wouldn't understand.

12:56.507 --> 12:59.125
Hey, well, see you.
I'm going out.

13:06.551 --> 13:09.035
I thought you were
leaving the apartment.

13:09.037 --> 13:11.755
Yeah, me, too.
I can't make up my mind.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.558
Are you concerned
because the world is filled

13:14.560 --> 13:17.510
with big dogs and bullies?

13:17.512 --> 13:20.764
No. I'm having a moral crisis.

13:20.766 --> 13:24.517
Well, if it's of
any help, I've read

13:24.519 --> 13:26.570
all the great
moral philosophers,

13:26.572 --> 13:29.105
including Dr. Seuss.

13:30.508 --> 13:32.158
Oh, what the hell.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.494
I'm supposed
to go see that girl

13:34.496 --> 13:36.896
from the comic book store,
Alice, but I don't know

13:36.898 --> 13:39.165
if I should, because
I'm going out with Priya,

13:39.167 --> 13:40.784
but she's in India.

13:40.786 --> 13:45.005
All right. So the topic at hand
is sexual fidelity.

13:45.007 --> 13:47.624
Probably won't be relying
on Seuss here.

13:49.343 --> 13:51.678
Although <i>One Fish, Two Fish,</i>
<i>Red Fish, Blue Fish</i>

13:51.680 --> 13:53.763
might be
surprisingly applicable.

13:55.182 --> 13:55.966
Go on.

13:55.968 --> 13:56.933
Well...

13:56.935 --> 13:58.852
they say
at the end of your life,

13:58.854 --> 14:00.604
you regret the stuff
you didn't do

14:00.606 --> 14:02.522
more than the stuff
that you did,

14:02.524 --> 14:06.493
and I'm pretty sure Alice
is the stuff I want to do.

14:06.495 --> 14:09.779
You know,
the German philosopher,

14:09.781 --> 14:13.533
Friedrich Nietzsche,
believed that morality

14:13.535 --> 14:17.404
is just a fiction used by the
herd of inferior human beings

14:17.406 --> 14:20.957
to hold back
the few superior men.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.276
That actually does help.

14:23.278 --> 14:27.063
It's worth noting that
he died of syphilis.

14:30.584 --> 14:32.002
Screw it,

14:32.004 --> 14:33.920
I'm going.
On your way home,

14:33.922 --> 14:35.338
will you pick up
some orange juice?

14:35.340 --> 14:36.389
Do you mind?
I'm questioning

14:36.391 --> 14:38.058
a lot of things
in my life right now.

14:38.060 --> 14:41.127
Is one of those things
your fondness for orange juice?

14:41.129 --> 14:42.512
No.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.014
Great. Tropicana, no pulp.

14:53.307 --> 14:54.474
Hey, Sheldon.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.909
Who is it!

14:55.911 --> 14:58.578
It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.

14:58.580 --> 15:02.415
That's not my mom,
it's Bernadette.

15:03.267 --> 15:06.319
Really?
That's very unsettling.

15:06.321 --> 15:07.787
Hi, Sheldon.

15:07.789 --> 15:09.956
- Hi.
- What's up?

15:09.958 --> 15:14.094
It just occurred to me that I
never formally congratulated you

15:14.096 --> 15:15.762
on your pending nuptials.

15:15.764 --> 15:17.130
So I hopped on

15:17.132 --> 15:20.016
the first bus and hightailed it
down here to shake your hand.

15:20.018 --> 15:23.303
Put 'er there,
you old so-and-so.

15:23.305 --> 15:25.939
Well, I-I'm gonna
see you at work in...

15:25.941 --> 15:29.342
12 hours-- don't you think it
could have waited until then?

15:30.227 --> 15:32.729
Holy smoke,
why didn't I think of that?

15:32.731 --> 15:35.315
You're a better man
than I, Howard Wolowitz.

15:35.317 --> 15:38.818
You put 'er there,
you son of a gun!

15:38.820 --> 15:40.403
Whatever.

15:41.856 --> 15:43.323
My... oh...

15:43.325 --> 15:44.857
it's...

15:46.544 --> 15:48.628
Oh, my God, Howard!

15:48.630 --> 15:49.746
What did you do?

15:49.748 --> 15:52.365
It was a harmless
Halloween prank. Look.

15:52.367 --> 15:55.201
Howard has a heart condition!
You know that!

15:55.203 --> 15:57.036
Well, I thought
he made that up.

15:57.038 --> 16:01.257
I-Isn't hypochondria a common
idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?

16:04.895 --> 16:06.229
This is adrenaline--
we're gonna have

16:06.231 --> 16:07.597
to inject it into his heart.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.066
- We are?
- You are. I'm not strong enough

16:10.068 --> 16:11.384
to get it through
his chest plate,

16:11.386 --> 16:12.852
and we've only got one shot.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.389
Oh, no! I can't!

16:16.391 --> 16:17.440
Hurry!

16:17.442 --> 16:19.192
We're running out of time!

16:19.944 --> 16:21.861
- Okay.
- Just do it!

16:21.863 --> 16:22.895
Oh, God!

16:22.897 --> 16:24.781
One... two...

16:24.783 --> 16:26.116
three!

16:26.118 --> 16:28.501
Trick or treat, bubbeleh.

16:28.503 --> 16:30.036
What?

16:31.673 --> 16:34.841
No. You mean
this was all a ruse?

16:34.843 --> 16:36.709
Oh, how could I be so stu...

16:36.711 --> 16:38.878
uuu....

16:41.298 --> 16:44.384
Mmm...

16:46.103 --> 16:47.270
Damn it, I can't.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.555
I can't do this.

16:48.557 --> 16:49.973
Uh, is it my tongue stud?

16:49.975 --> 16:51.424
'Cause if that
freaks you out,

16:51.426 --> 16:52.582
you're in for a real
surprise later on.

16:52.607 --> 16:53.807
No, no, no.

16:54.312 --> 16:56.112
I-I can't do <i>this.</i>

16:56.114 --> 16:58.314
Believe me,
I really want to.

16:58.316 --> 16:59.221
But...?

16:59.246 --> 17:00.882
But I kind of
have a girlfriend.

17:01.036 --> 17:02.368
Are you kidding?

17:02.370 --> 17:05.155
You're cool with you and me
just being friends, right?

17:05.156 --> 17:06.539
I don't believe this.

17:06.540 --> 17:09.742
Wait, I don't...
Which part?

17:09.743 --> 17:10.877
I'm so stupid.

17:10.878 --> 17:12.878
I thought for once
I'd met a good guy,

17:12.881 --> 17:14.380
but you're just another jackass.

17:14.382 --> 17:16.549
Oh, no, no, you
have it wrong.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.751
No. I-I was <i>going</i>

17:18.752 --> 17:22.088
to be a jackass, but
I stopped myself.

17:22.089 --> 17:23.839
I stayed

17:23.842 --> 17:24.973
a good guy, so...

17:24.976 --> 17:26.643
I'm gonna pass on the sex.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.344
But you should
know, that's not

17:28.346 --> 17:32.565
a comment on your hotness
but on my goodness.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.484
That's kind of my superpower.

17:34.486 --> 17:38.137
I'm, like, Captain Good Guy.

17:41.276 --> 17:42.325
It's okay.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.944
Did the right thing.

17:44.946 --> 17:47.146
You idiot!

17:52.406 --> 17:53.627
Hey, Priya.

17:53.628 --> 17:55.128
Hey, sweetheart.
How's it going?

17:55.130 --> 17:56.296
Uh, not so good.

17:56.298 --> 17:57.413
We have to talk.

17:57.415 --> 17:59.082
Oh, sounds serious.

17:59.084 --> 18:00.250
What's up?

18:00.252 --> 18:02.318
Okay, uh...

18:02.320 --> 18:04.120
here it is.

18:04.122 --> 18:06.205
I met this girl
and I kissed her,

18:06.207 --> 18:07.557
and I feel
terrible about it.

18:07.559 --> 18:09.459
But it's done, it's never
gonna happen again.

18:09.461 --> 18:11.961
And I am so, so sorry.

18:11.963 --> 18:13.463
Leonard, relax.

18:13.465 --> 18:14.614
It's okay.

18:14.616 --> 18:15.548
It is?

18:15.550 --> 18:17.350
Yeah, these things happen.

18:17.352 --> 18:18.885
They happen to everybody.

18:18.887 --> 18:22.839
Oh, my God, you are amazing.

18:22.841 --> 18:24.857
I mean, I don't deserve you.

18:24.859 --> 18:27.894
Wh-what do you mean "everybody"?

18:29.346 --> 18:31.814
Leonard, I didn't know
if I should tell you,

18:31.816 --> 18:35.234
but I kind of cheated
on you, too.

18:35.236 --> 18:37.737
Kind of?

18:37.739 --> 18:40.206
A couple of weeks ago,

18:40.208 --> 18:42.208
I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

18:42.210 --> 18:47.246
So, I guess we both messed up
a little.

18:47.248 --> 18:49.365
No, no, I messed up a little.

18:49.367 --> 18:52.085
You messed up a lot.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.836
Well, it's not a competition.

18:53.838 --> 18:57.173
Oh... yeah, it is,
and you won.

18:58.976 --> 19:02.178
I-I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

19:03.681 --> 19:05.765
I don't believe this.

19:17.947 --> 19:20.231
Bazinga, punk.
Now we're even.
