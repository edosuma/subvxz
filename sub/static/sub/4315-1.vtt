00:46.830 --> 00:50.136
There was a time,
a time before cable,

00:51.919 --> 00:55.006
when the local anchorman
reigned supreme,

00:58.007 --> 01:01.921
when people believed
everything they heard on TV.

01:01.964 --> 01:06.052
This was an age when only men
were allowed to read the news.

01:07.921 --> 01:12.532
And in San Diego, one anchorman
was more man than the rest.

01:12.576 --> 01:14.706
His name was Ron Burgundy.

01:17.011 --> 01:19.838
He was like a god
walking amongst mere mortals.

01:19.881 --> 01:24.274
He had a voice that could
make a wolverine purr,

01:25.361 --> 01:27.232
and suits so fine

01:27.232 --> 01:29.667
they made Sinatra
look like a hobo.

01:29.710 --> 01:34.712
In other words,
Ron Burgundy was the balls.

01:36.016 --> 01:39.191
Mmm. I look good.

01:40.279 --> 01:43.149
I mean, really good.

01:43.193 --> 01:47.889
Hey, everyone!
Come and see how good I look!

01:56.109 --> 01:59.545
Mm, ehh, mm.

01:59.589 --> 02:03.154
Ribs. I had ribs for lunch.
That's why I'm doing this.

02:03.198 --> 02:06.808
How now brown cow.
How now brown cow.

02:06.851 --> 02:08.372
How now brown cow.

02:08.372 --> 02:11.940
How are you?
You look awfully nice tonight. Hmm?

02:13.026 --> 02:15.158
Maybe don't wear
a bra next time.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.680
No, I was talking to you.
No, not her.

02:19.724 --> 02:22.116
I don't know her name.
What is it?

02:23.160 --> 02:25.247
Lanolin?

02:26.421 --> 02:28.509
La-lanolin?
Like sheep's wool?

02:29.465 --> 02:31.596
Unique New York.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.510
Unique New York.

02:33.510 --> 02:35.511
Mm, I love Scotch.

02:35.511 --> 02:37.947
I love Scotch.
Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch.

02:37.989 --> 02:39.512
Here it goes down.

02:39.512 --> 02:41.948
Down into my belly.
Mm-mm-mm.

02:41.991 --> 02:44.251
The arsonist
has oddly shaped feet.

02:44.295 --> 02:48.253
How much time?
30? 30 seconds?

02:48.296 --> 02:51.515
- You are on.
- I'm on right now?

02:51.558 --> 02:53.385
I don't believe you.

02:53.385 --> 02:56.342
- ♪ Doo doo doo. ♪
- Ron!

02:56.342 --> 02:58.473
Oh, come on. Audrey.

02:58.517 --> 03:01.256
I look like hell.
I got bags under my eyes.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.387
What's that?
If you were a man,

03:03.431 --> 03:05.345
I'd punch you right
in the mouth.

03:05.345 --> 03:07.301
That's bush.
Bush league.

03:07.301 --> 03:10.650
The human torch was denied
a bank loan.

03:10.694 --> 03:14.390
You hear me?
Audrey, look at me!

03:14.433 --> 03:15.869
I'm sorry.

03:15.869 --> 03:17.652
All right?
I'm sorry.

03:17.652 --> 03:21.001
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ho!

03:21.045 --> 03:22.654
Ha ha ho.

03:22.654 --> 03:24.741
Ha oh!

03:26.220 --> 03:28.525
All right, we're on.

03:28.525 --> 03:30.526
Ready, Phil.

03:30.526 --> 03:32.613
We're on in five, four...

03:33.396 --> 03:35.527
When the clock struck 6:00,

03:35.571 --> 03:37.527
it meant one thing
for Ron Burgundy

03:37.527 --> 03:39.963
and his news team:
Go time.

03:40.007 --> 03:40.137
Channel 4 News,

03:40.137 --> 03:42.224
Channel 4 News,

03:42.224 --> 03:45.051
with five-time
Emmy award-winning anchor

03:45.051 --> 03:46.835
Ron Burgundy.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.617
Champ Kind, sports.

03:48.617 --> 03:50.704
Ooh! Hoo-hoo!

03:51.488 --> 03:53.575
Brick Tamland, weather.

03:55.793 --> 03:58.620
And your reporter in the field,
Brian Fantana.

04:02.316 --> 04:04.924
It's Channel 4 News
at 6:00.

04:08.404 --> 04:10.406
Good evening.
I'm Ron Burgundy,

04:10.406 --> 04:12.797
and this is what's happening
in your world tonight.

04:12.841 --> 04:16.276
A La Jolla man clings to life
at a university hospital

04:16.321 --> 04:19.625
after being viciously attacked
by a pack of wild dogs

04:19.668 --> 04:21.452
in an abandoned pool.

04:21.452 --> 04:26.063
Hey, everybody! Shut the hell up!
Ron Burgundy's on!

04:26.105 --> 04:28.975
Authorities are still
uncertain as to why the man

04:29.018 --> 04:31.585
- was loitering...
- Ron Burgundy.

04:31.627 --> 04:33.715
Oh, my gosh!
She said her first words!

04:33.715 --> 04:36.673
Right now it's 82'
in our fair city,

04:36.716 --> 04:40.632
and compare that to 48'
in the upper Northwest

04:40.632 --> 04:43.631
and 38'
in the Middle East.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.023
Off the coast
of Tampa Bay yesterday,

04:46.067 --> 04:48.459
one lucky cameraman
happened to catch

04:48.502 --> 04:51.068
an unusual
aquatic daredevil.

04:51.112 --> 04:54.765
What you're about to see
is a Channel 4 News exclusive.

04:54.809 --> 04:57.591
His name is
Nutty the Squirrel,

04:57.635 --> 04:59.724
and he's three years old.

04:59.724 --> 05:03.114
How 'bout that?

05:03.159 --> 05:06.943
That squirrel
can water-ski.

05:08.464 --> 05:11.509
- Man, that's hilarious.
- Yeah, that's good.

05:11.552 --> 05:14.205
For all of us here
at News Center 4,

05:14.249 --> 05:15.727
I'm Ron Burgundy.

05:15.727 --> 05:17.640
You stay classy,
San Diego.

05:17.640 --> 05:22.119
You stay classy, San Diego.

05:22.163 --> 05:25.208
Listen up.
The ratings just came in for last month.

05:25.251 --> 05:28.427
We are number one.
We just grabbed every key demographic.

05:28.470 --> 05:30.601
- Super-duper, gang!
- Yeah! Yeah!

05:30.644 --> 05:32.689
Super-duper!
That's nice!

05:32.689 --> 05:34.340
Way to go!
Neat-o, gang.

05:34.340 --> 05:36.036
- Yes!
- Boy, Ed.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.255
That is good news.
I gotta be honest.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.994
- Congrats, congrats.
- That is good news!

05:41.037 --> 05:42.735
- All right!
- Stick around.

05:42.735 --> 05:44.953
Make sure these guys
don't party too much.

05:44.996 --> 05:47.692
- They don't really ever listen to me.
- Just get it done.

05:47.736 --> 05:47.823
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

05:47.823 --> 05:51.693
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

05:51.693 --> 05:54.041
I've just been handed
an urgent

05:54.085 --> 05:57.043
and horrifying news story.

05:57.086 --> 06:00.043
I need all of you
to stop what you're doing

06:00.086 --> 06:01.522
and listen.

06:01.522 --> 06:03.740
Cannonball!

06:07.523 --> 06:10.611
Yes, these fellas were a real news team.

06:10.654 --> 06:14.351
Burgundy, of course,
was the foundation, the rock.

06:14.394 --> 06:18.526
But each member brought their own
special something to the equation.

06:18.569 --> 06:20.701
People call me
the Bri-man.

06:20.745 --> 06:23.137
I'm the stylish one
of the group.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.224
I know what
you're asking yourself,

06:25.224 --> 06:28.486
and the answer is yes,
I have a nickname for my penis.

06:28.530 --> 06:30.529
It's called the Octagon.

06:30.529 --> 06:32.531
But I also nicknamed
my testes.

06:32.531 --> 06:34.530
My left one
is James Westfall,

06:34.530 --> 06:37.140
and my right one is
Dr. Kenneth Noisewater.

06:37.184 --> 06:40.880
You ladies play your cards right,
you might get to meet the whole gang.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.141
Bang, boom, they were
showing lasers

06:43.184 --> 06:45.576
every Friday night.

06:45.620 --> 06:49.056
Champ here.
I'm all about havin' fun.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.927
You know, get a couple
of cocktails in me,

06:51.927 --> 06:54.014
start a fire
in someone's kitchen.

06:54.057 --> 06:56.536
Maybe go to SeaWorld,
take my pants off.

06:56.579 --> 06:58.581
Anyway, I've become
kind of famous

06:58.581 --> 07:01.581
for my signature catchphrase,
"Whammy!"

07:01.625 --> 07:04.886
As in, "Gene Tenace
at the plate...

07:04.929 --> 07:07.843
and whammy!"

07:07.887 --> 07:09.975
Whammy!

07:16.455 --> 07:17.846
I'm Brick Tamland.

07:17.846 --> 07:20.413
People seem to like me
because I am polite

07:20.455 --> 07:22.326
and I'm rarely late.

07:22.326 --> 07:24.325
I like to eat ice cream,

07:24.325 --> 07:27.545
and I really enjoy
a nice pair of slacks.

07:27.588 --> 07:29.849
Years later,
a doctor will tell me

07:29.849 --> 07:32.633
that I have an IQ of 48

07:32.676 --> 07:34.763
and am what some people call

07:34.807 --> 07:36.808
"mentally retarded."

07:36.808 --> 07:38.417
Hello!

07:38.417 --> 07:41.070
- Whoo! Marco!
- Polo!

07:42.592 --> 07:44.418
- Brian.
- You having a good time?

07:44.418 --> 07:46.811
- I'm having a great time.
- That makes two of us.

07:46.853 --> 07:48.593
You've gotta meet this girl.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.768
She used to be a Charger cheerleader,
but she broke her pelvis.

07:51.812 --> 07:54.117
Sherri,
meet Ron Burgundy.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.291
- Hey, Ron.
- Hello.

07:56.335 --> 07:58.597
- I've got a big story for you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:58.639 --> 08:00.466
And it's right here.

08:00.466 --> 08:02.553
Well, hello.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.338
You pointed to your boobies.

08:06.338 --> 08:08.468
Oh, my God, you did!

08:10.294 --> 08:12.643
- Ron Burgundy?
- Yes?

08:12.643 --> 08:16.123
I have had a crush on you
since I was a little girl.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.775
Let's go somewhere.

08:17.775 --> 08:20.951
I'm telling you, it don't
get no better than this.

08:20.994 --> 08:23.690
We've been coming
to the same party for 12 years,

08:23.734 --> 08:25.821
and in no way
is that depressing.

08:29.169 --> 08:30.519
Ahh.

08:30.519 --> 08:32.692
♪ Gonna make
our own lightning ♪

08:32.736 --> 08:36.171

08:47.696 --> 08:50.001
By the beard of Zeus!

08:54.393 --> 08:56.480
Excuse me.

08:57.742 --> 09:01.526
Ron, where you going?
What, are you crazy? Ron!

09:01.526 --> 09:05.439
If you're coming down the baseline,
you gotta take home plate from me!

09:05.483 --> 09:08.963
So there I go,
head first, boom!

09:12.398 --> 09:14.485
I've lost her.

09:24.226 --> 09:26.314
Ohh.

09:33.056 --> 09:35.143
Hello.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.230
Hello.

09:37.230 --> 09:40.797
Hope I'm not disturbing
you, but, uh,

09:40.840 --> 09:43.797
I saw you from across
the party, and, uh,

09:43.841 --> 09:47.451
I don't usually do this, but I felt
compelled to tell you something.

09:50.104 --> 09:51.452
You have...

09:51.452 --> 09:53.975
an absolutely
breathtaking...

09:54.018 --> 09:56.105
heinie.

09:56.584 --> 09:58.802
I mean, that thing is good.

09:58.845 --> 10:01.063
I want to be friends with it.

10:02.411 --> 10:05.412
Well, you certainly know
how to compliment a woman.

10:05.456 --> 10:07.456
Now, if you'll excuse me.

10:07.456 --> 10:09.674
Do you know who I am?

10:11.414 --> 10:13.457
No, I can't say that I do.

10:13.457 --> 10:17.416
I don't know how to put this,

10:17.458 --> 10:20.589
but I'm kind of a big deal.

10:20.634 --> 10:22.112
Really?

10:22.112 --> 10:24.243
People know me.

10:24.287 --> 10:26.286
I've very happy for you.

10:26.286 --> 10:27.810
I'm very important.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.679
I have...

10:29.679 --> 10:31.898
many leather-bound books,

10:31.941 --> 10:34.332
and my apartment

10:34.376 --> 10:36.812
smells of rich mahogany.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.856
That's stupid.

10:41.987 --> 10:45.378
No, no, that's...
very exciting.

10:45.422 --> 10:47.555
Listen, can I--

10:47.598 --> 10:49.728
can I start over again?

10:49.772 --> 10:51.772
Sure.

10:51.772 --> 10:54.817
I wanna say something.
I'm gonna put it out there.

10:54.861 --> 10:56.818
If you like it,
you can take it.

10:56.818 --> 10:58.426
If you don't,
send it right back.

10:58.426 --> 11:00.513
Mm-hmm.

11:00.513 --> 11:02.601
I wanna be on you.

11:04.341 --> 11:07.341
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

11:07.385 --> 11:09.473
I--

11:12.646 --> 11:15.256
I wanna be on you.

11:29.304 --> 11:31.304
Yoo-hoo!

11:31.304 --> 11:33.348
Baxter!

11:33.348 --> 11:34.958
Papa's home.

11:34.958 --> 11:37.046
There he is.
There's my little man.

11:37.088 --> 11:39.349
You're okay?

11:39.393 --> 11:41.699
Of course I met
a lady tonight.

11:43.655 --> 11:45.786
This one was different.
I have to be honest.

11:47.048 --> 11:48.352
Quite different.

11:48.352 --> 11:51.049
What--

11:51.093 --> 11:53.353
I'm lonely?
I'm not lonely!

11:53.396 --> 11:56.876
I'm beloved by everyone
in San Diego.

12:00.399 --> 12:03.052
Wow.

12:03.096 --> 12:06.010
You know how to cut
to the core of me, Baxter.

12:06.052 --> 12:08.793
You're so wise.

12:10.053 --> 12:12.707
You're like
a miniature Buddha

12:12.707 --> 12:14.490
covered in hair.

12:14.490 --> 12:16.663
Come again?

12:18.622 --> 12:21.534
You know I don't speak Spanish.
In English, please.

12:21.578 --> 12:23.666
Huh?

12:23.666 --> 12:26.493
You pooped in the refrigerator?

12:26.536 --> 12:30.537
And you ate a whole wheel of cheese?

12:30.581 --> 12:32.450
How'd you do that?

12:32.450 --> 12:34.930
I'm not even mad.
That's amazing.

12:34.973 --> 12:38.539
I forgive you.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.279
What do you say we get you
in your pj's and hit the hay?

12:41.323 --> 12:45.194
Bedtime. Okay, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.502
Oh, that was one
crazy party.

13:02.545 --> 13:05.285
I am hung over.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.808
I woke up this morning

13:18.333 --> 13:20.768
All right, guys.
Let's focus up.

13:20.812 --> 13:23.290
Morning, everyone.

13:23.334 --> 13:26.073
Here are the stories
we're going to be chasing today.

13:26.116 --> 13:27.813
It looks like Ling Wong,

13:27.813 --> 13:30.727
the rare panda
at the San Diego Zoo, is pregnant.

13:30.771 --> 13:32.424
This is a big one.

13:32.424 --> 13:35.250
This could be the big
story of the summer.

13:35.294 --> 13:38.164
Network is gonna be wanting
plenty of coverage.

13:38.164 --> 13:40.903
And speaking of network,
word on the street is

13:40.947 --> 13:42.948
they're looking
for a new anchor.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.949
- So, Ron...
- Huh? Network?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.036
Are they here?

13:51.516 --> 13:54.342
A lot of you have been hearing
the affiliates complaining

13:54.386 --> 13:57.213
about a lack of diversity
on the news team.

14:03.606 --> 14:05.823
What in the hell's diversity?

14:05.867 --> 14:08.172
Well, I could be wrong,

14:08.215 --> 14:11.737
but I believe diversity
is an old, old wooden ship

14:11.737 --> 14:15.087
that was used
during the Civil War era.

14:15.131 --> 14:17.827
I would be surprised
if the affiliates were concerned

14:17.870 --> 14:20.001
about the lack
of an old wooden ship,

14:20.045 --> 14:22.306
but nice try.

14:22.349 --> 14:25.003
Diversity means
that times are changing,

14:25.003 --> 14:27.221
and with that in mind--

14:27.264 --> 14:30.222
- Ron, are you paying attention?
- Nope.

14:30.264 --> 14:32.396
- This concerns all of us.
- Okay.

14:32.440 --> 14:36.179
Keeping that in mind, I'd like
to introduce the latest addition

14:36.222 --> 14:38.354
to the KVWN News Team,

14:38.397 --> 14:41.094
directly from WYPN

14:41.137 --> 14:44.312
in Asheville, North Carolina,

14:44.356 --> 14:47.357
Ms. Veronica Corningstone.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.356
- ♪ Who's that lady? ♪
- Hello.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.835
- ♪ Who's that lady... ♪
- Hello, everyone.

14:52.879 --> 14:55.314
- Oh!
- I just want you all to know

14:55.358 --> 14:57.576
that I look forward
to contributing

14:57.576 --> 15:00.751
to this news station's
already sterling reputation.

15:03.448 --> 15:05.752
I mean, come on, Ed!
It's bullcrap!

15:05.796 --> 15:08.188
Don't get me wrong.
I love the ladies.

15:08.232 --> 15:11.623
They rev my engine,
but they don't belong in the newsroom!

15:11.667 --> 15:14.972
It is anchorman,
not anchorlady!

15:15.015 --> 15:18.582
- And that is a scientific fact!
- Uh-huh.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.757
I don't know
what we're yelling about!

15:22.931 --> 15:24.670
Ron, what do you think?

15:24.670 --> 15:26.757
She-- sh--
it's terrible!

15:26.757 --> 15:29.672
She has beautiful eyes,
and her hair smells like cinnamon!

15:29.716 --> 15:31.019
Mm-hmm.

15:31.019 --> 15:33.108
Loud noises!

15:34.021 --> 15:37.718
All right, everyone relax.
She's not gonna take anyone's airtime.

15:37.761 --> 15:41.327
I read somewhere that
their periods attract bears.

15:41.370 --> 15:44.110
Bears can smell
the menstruation.

15:44.154 --> 15:47.720
Well, that's just great.
You hear that, Ed?

15:47.764 --> 15:50.677
Bears. Now you're putting
the whole station in jeopardy.

15:50.721 --> 15:53.243
I will say
one thing for her, Ed,

15:53.330 --> 15:56.419
she does have a nice,
big old behind.

15:56.462 --> 15:59.635
I'd like to put some
barbecue sauce on that butt

15:59.679 --> 16:02.288
and just bite, bite, bite, bite,
munch, munch, munch!

16:02.332 --> 16:04.898
- Ah-whoo!
- Stop it! Oh, Jeez.

16:07.856 --> 16:11.074
Look at the full-moon butt!

16:11.118 --> 16:13.205
Champ! Champ!
Champ, Champ!

16:14.684 --> 16:16.771
Mr. Harken, I was just wondering

16:16.771 --> 16:18.814
if you knew when my office
would be ready.

16:18.814 --> 16:20.903
Well, that might
take some time.

16:20.903 --> 16:24.121
For now, why don't you just
grab a desk in the bullpen?

16:24.164 --> 16:27.295
You can use my office! Then afterwards
maybe we can go to lunch!

16:28.643 --> 16:30.166
Lower your voice, Ron.

16:30.166 --> 16:32.167
Mm-hmm!

16:32.167 --> 16:35.254
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Harken.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.168
I'll go get
my desk set up.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.736
Oh, she is a saucy mama!
I mean, I would...

16:50.562 --> 16:52.911
Here we go again.

16:52.954 --> 16:54.998
Every station
it's the same.

16:54.998 --> 16:57.563
Women ask me
how I put up with it.

16:57.607 --> 17:00.173
Well, the truth is,
I don't really have a choice.

17:00.217 --> 17:02.174
This is definitely
a man's world.

17:02.174 --> 17:04.392
But while they're laughing
and grab-assing,

17:04.435 --> 17:06.088
I'm chasing down leads

17:06.088 --> 17:08.829
and practicing
my nonregional diction.

17:08.872 --> 17:11.829
Because the only way to win
is to be the best.

17:11.873 --> 17:13.960
The very best.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.613
Touchy situation.

17:18.613 --> 17:22.092
I think the best thing
to do with this Corningstone,

17:22.092 --> 17:24.702
to keep her in line,
is bed her quick.

17:24.744 --> 17:28.181
Oh, that behind
is driving me loco!

17:28.224 --> 17:30.661
I'm like a night wolf.

17:30.747 --> 17:33.182
Guys, take it easy.
Just take it easy!

17:33.225 --> 17:36.749
- She's got feelings, too.
- Oh, my God!

17:36.791 --> 17:38.357
Listen to Burgundy.

17:38.357 --> 17:41.403
He's gone soft on us,
like some schoolboy bitch.

17:41.446 --> 17:43.532
You sound like a gay.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.448
Hey! Come on!

17:47.448 --> 17:50.274
It's me, Papa Burgundy,
all right?

17:50.317 --> 17:53.884
As far as I'm concerned,
Corningstone's fair game.

17:53.928 --> 17:56.623
Huh?
Let the games begin!

17:56.667 --> 17:58.799
Hi-ohhh!

17:58.842 --> 18:01.277
There he is.
There he is.

18:01.277 --> 18:03.364
I'm very aroused.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.757
What's this?

18:10.062 --> 18:12.149
Well, well, well.

18:14.280 --> 18:17.891
Ron Burgundy and the Channel 4
News Team.

18:17.934 --> 18:20.021
Hello, Wes Mantooth.

18:20.064 --> 18:21.890
Hello,
Evening News Team.

18:21.890 --> 18:23.414
Nice clothes, gentlemen.

18:23.414 --> 18:26.109
I didn't know the Salvation Army
was having a sale.

18:28.588 --> 18:30.763
Am I right?
Look at these guys.

18:33.285 --> 18:36.633
Hey, where did you
get those clothes?

18:36.677 --> 18:38.765
At the toilet store?

18:41.636 --> 18:44.462
What are you doing
on our station's turf, Burgundy?

18:44.505 --> 18:46.941
You're about to get
a serious beat-down.

18:46.985 --> 18:50.420
I will smash your face
into a car windshield

18:50.463 --> 18:52.638
and then take your mother,
Dorothy Mantooth,

18:52.682 --> 18:57.161
out for a nice seafood dinner
and never call her again!

18:57.204 --> 19:00.031
Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
You understand me?

19:00.074 --> 19:02.597
- Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
- Hey.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.293
Leave the mothers
out of this, all right?

19:07.772 --> 19:09.860
It's unnecessary.

19:11.034 --> 19:14.165
Besides, I'm sure Wes here

19:14.209 --> 19:18.689
is just upset over finishing
second in the ratings again.

19:18.732 --> 19:20.516
Ooh!

19:20.516 --> 19:23.038
That's completely
uncalled for, Burgundy.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.169
You know those
rating systems are flawed.

19:25.212 --> 19:27.431
They don't take into account
houses that have

19:27.431 --> 19:31.039
more than two television sets
and other things of that nature.

19:31.083 --> 19:34.389
I guess I have to take you
at your word,

19:34.432 --> 19:36.519
Number Two.

19:38.650 --> 19:41.390
You have
a great day, fellas.

19:41.434 --> 19:43.521
We'll see you around the bend.

19:46.043 --> 19:48.131
Son of a bitch!

19:48.174 --> 19:51.305
Excusez-moi, Numero Two.

19:53.785 --> 19:56.003
Hey, Burgundy.

19:56.047 --> 19:58.526
You know those sample audiences
aren't big enough!

19:58.569 --> 20:02.047
Stop hiding behind those phony numbers,
Burgundy! I'm coming after you!

20:02.091 --> 20:06.700
I hate you, Ron Burgundy.
I hate you!

20:06.744 --> 20:09.876
You can't say one word?

20:09.920 --> 20:12.050
Even the guy who can't
think says something!

20:12.093 --> 20:14.703
You guys just stand
there? Come on!

20:17.008 --> 20:20.053
Right, but I think my son
is just going through a phase.

20:21.227 --> 20:22.923
I have no idea where

20:22.923 --> 20:25.750
he would have gotten ahold
of German pornography.

20:25.793 --> 20:27.881
But you and I
are mature adults.

20:27.925 --> 20:31.272
We've both seen our share
of pornographic materials.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.795
Oh, you never have?

20:32.795 --> 20:35.534
Of course you haven't,
how stupid of me. Neither have I.

20:35.578 --> 20:37.840
I was just speaking
in generalities.

20:37.883 --> 20:42.276
I'll stop by the school
a little later, Sister Margaret. Bye.

20:42.276 --> 20:45.277
Ed, she insisted
on coming in.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.930
Mr. Harken, sir,

20:46.930 --> 20:49.929
I will not have my first story
at this news station

20:49.929 --> 20:51.931
be about a cat fashion show.

20:51.931 --> 20:54.583
Miss Corningstone, ma'am,

20:54.627 --> 20:57.802
you will do the stories
to which you are assigned.

20:57.845 --> 21:00.715
Mr. Harken, I am
a damn good journalist,

21:00.759 --> 21:03.934
and this cat show thing
is grade-A baloney.

21:03.977 --> 21:06.978
It is not baloney.
Now, go do your job, missy!

21:07.022 --> 21:09.239
It is baloney!

21:13.719 --> 21:16.111
Hey, Ron,

21:16.154 --> 21:18.504
I'm gonna take a run
at the new girl.

21:18.546 --> 21:20.633
Let the games begin.

21:20.633 --> 21:23.764
Oh, Champ, Champ,
we're not really gonna actually do that.

21:23.808 --> 21:26.026
- We were just flapping our gums.
- Oh, yeah.

21:26.070 --> 21:28.158
You kill me, Burgundy.

21:28.897 --> 21:32.507
Let me just grab this.
Oh, sorry about that.

21:32.551 --> 21:34.725
- Whammy.
- Hmm.

21:34.769 --> 21:37.073
- Uh, Champ?
- Yeah.

21:37.116 --> 21:39.683
You're trying to touch
my breasts, aren't you?

21:39.725 --> 21:43.466
What can I say?
I like the way you're put together.

21:43.509 --> 21:46.119
What do you say
we go out on a date?

21:46.162 --> 21:48.642
Have some chicken,
maybe some sex.

21:48.685 --> 21:50.337
You know,
see what happens?

21:50.337 --> 21:53.251
Oh, let me get this
over here.

21:54.774 --> 21:56.644
Sorry.

21:56.644 --> 21:58.992
Oh, there it is.

21:59.036 --> 22:01.209
I'll give this
little cookie an hour

22:01.253 --> 22:03.341
before we're doing
the no-pants dance.

22:03.341 --> 22:05.646
Time to musk up.

22:08.516 --> 22:09.907
Wow.

22:09.907 --> 22:12.779
It never ceases to amaze me.

22:12.822 --> 22:14.996
What cologne
you gonna go with?

22:15.040 --> 22:16.648
London Gentleman, or--

22:16.648 --> 22:19.824
wait. No, no, no.
Hold on.

22:19.867 --> 22:21.519
Blackbeard's Delight.

22:21.519 --> 22:24.303
No, she gets
a special cologne.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.260
It's called Sex Panther
by Odeon.

22:28.303 --> 22:32.262
It's illegal in nine countries.

22:32.305 --> 22:34.784
Yep, it's made with bits
of real panther.

22:34.784 --> 22:37.611
- So you know it's good.
- It's quite pungent.

22:37.654 --> 22:38.959
Oh yeah.

22:38.959 --> 22:41.003
It's a formidable scent.

22:41.003 --> 22:44.091
It stings the nostrils.

22:44.135 --> 22:46.048
- In a good way.
- Yep.

22:46.048 --> 22:48.875
I'll be honest with you.
That smells like pure gasoline.

22:48.918 --> 22:51.310
They've done studies,
you know.

22:51.353 --> 22:55.137
60% of the time,
it works every time.

22:55.137 --> 22:57.137
That doesn't make sense.

22:57.137 --> 22:59.572
Well...

22:59.572 --> 23:02.008
Let's go see if we can
make this little kitty purr.

23:07.183 --> 23:10.706
Hey, sweet cheeks. Got an invite
I'd like to extend your way.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.186
My God.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.187
What is that smell?

23:18.187 --> 23:19.490
- Oh!

23:19.490 --> 23:21.666
That's the smell
of desire, milady.

23:21.710 --> 23:23.797
God, no, it smells like--

23:23.839 --> 23:27.145
like a used diaper
filled with Indian food.

23:27.189 --> 23:29.189
Oh!
Excuse me.

23:29.189 --> 23:31.190
Desire smells like that
to some people.

23:31.190 --> 23:35.017
What is that? Smells like a turd
covered in burnt hair!

23:39.453 --> 23:41.584
It smells like
Bigfoot's dick!

23:43.628 --> 23:45.716
Oh, hell, that's rank!

23:47.976 --> 23:50.064
Oh, what's that smell?

23:54.328 --> 23:57.632
This is worse than the time
the raccoon got in the copier.

23:57.674 --> 23:59.154
Yeah.

23:59.154 --> 24:00.806
It's very distracting.

24:00.806 --> 24:03.677
- When we get to the pet shop--
- Cough!

24:03.720 --> 24:05.329
Look over here.

24:05.329 --> 24:07.242
Excuse me, Veronica.

24:07.242 --> 24:09.940
Yes, what is it, Brick?

24:09.983 --> 24:11.983
I would like
to extend to you

24:11.983 --> 24:14.157
an invitation
to the pants party.

24:15.202 --> 24:16.506
Excuse me?

24:16.506 --> 24:19.289
The party.
The pants--

24:19.332 --> 24:22.160
With the pants.
Party with pants?

24:22.204 --> 24:23.638
Brick, are you saying

24:23.638 --> 24:26.160
that there's a party in
your pants and I'm invited?

24:26.204 --> 24:27.814
That's it.

24:27.814 --> 24:30.728
Hmm. Did Brian tell you
to say this, Brick?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.686
No--
yes, he did.

24:32.686 --> 24:37.338
Okay. No, I don't want to go
to a party in your pants.

24:37.381 --> 24:39.078
Very well.
Ian?

24:39.078 --> 24:41.077
Would you like to go
to a party in my pants?

24:41.077 --> 24:42.992
No, Brick.

24:42.992 --> 24:45.079
All right. Let's go!

24:47.168 --> 24:51.254
All right, now...

24:51.254 --> 24:54.430
I'm telling you,
she is a real ball-buster.

24:54.474 --> 24:56.561
A real ice queen.

24:56.604 --> 24:59.909
Mm. I just
burned my tongue.

24:59.952 --> 25:02.214
The only way
to bag a classy lady

25:02.257 --> 25:05.084
is to give her two tickets
to the gun show...

25:08.129 --> 25:10.216
and see if she likes
the goods.

25:12.259 --> 25:14.305
1,001.

25:14.305 --> 25:18.262
1,002.

25:18.306 --> 25:20.480
- Uh, Mr. Burgundy?
- 1,003.

25:20.524 --> 25:22.828
Helen said that you
needed to see me?

25:22.872 --> 25:24.263
Oh, Miss Corningstone.

25:24.263 --> 25:27.308
I wasn't expecting company.

25:30.482 --> 25:32.701
Just doing my workout.

25:32.744 --> 25:34.701
Tuesday's arms and back.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.919
- You asked me to come by, sir.
- Oh, did I?

25:37.962 --> 25:40.050
Yes.

25:41.268 --> 25:43.529
Oh, it's the deep burn!

25:43.573 --> 25:46.661
Oh, it's so deep.

25:46.704 --> 25:49.706
I can barely lift my right
arm 'cause I did so many.

25:49.748 --> 25:53.359
I don't know if you heard me counting.
I did over 1,000.

25:53.401 --> 25:55.402
You have your ubulus muscle

25:55.402 --> 25:58.228
that connects
to the upper dorsinus.

25:58.272 --> 26:00.534
It's boring,
but it's part of my life.

26:00.577 --> 26:03.404
I'm just gonna grab this shirt,
if you don't mind.

26:03.447 --> 26:06.752
Just watch out for the guns.
They'll get you.

26:06.796 --> 26:08.536
You are pathetic.

26:08.536 --> 26:11.015
This has to be
the feeblest

26:11.102 --> 26:13.668
pickup attempt
that I have ever encountered.

26:13.710 --> 26:17.626
I expected it from the rest of them,
Mr. Burgundy, but not from you.

26:17.626 --> 26:19.974
Wait a minute!
I-- pickup attempt?

26:20.018 --> 26:21.539
I'm offended.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.931
I have little time
to get to the gym,

26:23.974 --> 26:26.584
so I have to sculpt
my guns at the office.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.542
Oh, stop calling
your arms "guns."

26:29.586 --> 26:31.585
Look.

26:31.585 --> 26:33.760
My plan was to ask you

26:33.802 --> 26:36.412
if I could squire you
about town

26:36.457 --> 26:39.110
as one professional
helping another professional,

26:39.154 --> 26:42.197
because I know what it's like
to be lonely in a new city.

26:44.546 --> 26:46.633
- Really?
- Yes.

26:46.633 --> 26:49.242
But now I am too hurt.

26:49.286 --> 26:51.939
And shocked and offended

26:51.983 --> 26:53.331
and-- and hurt.

26:53.331 --> 26:55.244
I could do that.

26:55.244 --> 26:56.463
Really?

26:56.463 --> 26:58.419
Well, yes.

26:58.419 --> 27:00.419
As a journalist,
I should get to know

27:00.419 --> 27:02.376
the city
that I'm covering.

27:02.376 --> 27:05.334
- But this is not a date.
- No, of course not.

27:05.378 --> 27:08.074
- Strictly professional.
- Wonderful.

27:08.117 --> 27:10.466
- Hmm.
- Great.

27:12.292 --> 27:13.814
Shall I pick you up

27:13.814 --> 27:15.902
8:00?

27:17.511 --> 27:19.598
Mm, 9:00.

27:20.730 --> 27:22.164
Downstairs?

27:22.164 --> 27:25.165
Mr. Burgundy, you have
a massive erection.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.252
Really?

27:28.644 --> 27:31.123
Yes, I do.
Um...

27:31.167 --> 27:33.906
I'm sorry, it's the--

27:33.950 --> 27:36.297
- it's the pleats.
- Mm.

27:36.342 --> 27:38.603
It's actually
an optical illusion.

27:38.647 --> 27:40.647
It's the pattern
on the pants.

27:40.647 --> 27:44.039
It's not flattering
in the crotchal region.

27:44.082 --> 27:46.170
I'm actually
taking them back right now.

27:46.214 --> 27:49.171
Taking them back
to the pants store.

27:50.170 --> 27:52.476
Oh, this is awkward.

27:53.912 --> 27:56.782
and I will see you later.

28:05.610 --> 28:07.698
Don't act like
you're not impressed.

28:07.785 --> 28:09.655
Frame up two.

28:09.655 --> 28:12.568
- Let's go to Brian Fantana live...
- Gimme a tighter one on two.

28:12.612 --> 28:15.004
...with a Channel 4
News exclusive.

28:15.048 --> 28:16.439
Brian?

28:16.439 --> 28:18.744
Panda watch.
The mood is tense.

28:18.786 --> 28:21.441
I have been on some
serious, serious reports,

28:21.484 --> 28:23.136
but nothing like this.

28:23.136 --> 28:26.181
I-- I-- Ching--
King is inside now.

28:26.225 --> 28:29.225
I tried to get an interview,
but they said, "You can't.

28:29.269 --> 28:32.053
He's a live bear. He will
literally rip your face off."

28:32.096 --> 28:35.053
Hey! You're making me
look stupid!

28:35.096 --> 28:37.967
Get out here!
Panda jerk!

28:38.011 --> 28:40.706
Great story.
Compelling and rich.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.969
That's gonna do it for all
of us at Channel 4 News.

28:45.012 --> 28:47.272
You stay classy,
San Diego.

28:47.316 --> 28:49.405
I'm Ron Burgundy?

28:50.492 --> 28:54.232
Damn it! Who typed a question mark
on the Teleprompter?

28:54.276 --> 28:57.580
For the last time, anything
you put on that prompter,

28:57.624 --> 28:59.712
Burgundy will read.

29:01.929 --> 29:04.581
Oh, God,
this is a mistake.

29:04.625 --> 29:06.495
This is a mistake.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.627
He's very cute. Very cute.
No, he's not. He's hairy.

29:09.670 --> 29:12.106
There she is!
Veronica!

29:12.150 --> 29:14.585
My little China doll.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.585
I am full of it tonight.

29:16.585 --> 29:19.064
Oh, silly. Hi.

29:19.108 --> 29:21.195
You look ravishing.

29:21.195 --> 29:24.196
It truly is beauty
and the beast.

29:25.761 --> 29:27.676
I might add
a handsome beast at that.

29:27.676 --> 29:29.415
Are you ready
for our rendezvous?

29:29.415 --> 29:31.068
It's not a date.

29:31.068 --> 29:33.721
No, strictly professional.

29:33.764 --> 29:36.287
Doesn't mean
we can't have fun.

29:36.331 --> 29:38.417
- Shall we?
- Yes.

29:42.679 --> 29:44.768
San Diego.

29:45.767 --> 29:47.768
Mm! Drink it in.

29:47.768 --> 29:49.855
It always
goes down smooth.

29:52.029 --> 29:54.031
What a beautiful view,
Mr. Burgundy.

29:54.031 --> 29:57.378
I know. I love this city.
It's a--

29:57.422 --> 29:59.162
it's a fact.

29:59.162 --> 30:01.424
It's the greatest city
in the history of mankind.

30:03.164 --> 30:06.512
Discovered by the Germans
in 1904.

30:06.512 --> 30:09.686
They named it San Diago,

30:09.730 --> 30:13.774
which of course in German
means a whale's vagina.

30:16.036 --> 30:18.950
N-- no, there's
no way that's correct.

30:23.385 --> 30:26.212
I'm sorry.
I was trying to impress you.

30:26.256 --> 30:28.038
Oh.

30:28.038 --> 30:30.779
I don't know what it means.

30:30.822 --> 30:33.779
I'll be honest. I don't think anyone
knows what it means anymore.

30:33.823 --> 30:36.172
Scholars maintain that
the translation was lost

30:36.215 --> 30:38.216
hundreds of years ago.

30:38.216 --> 30:40.607
Doesn't it mean
Saint Diego?

30:41.739 --> 30:44.522
No. No.

30:44.566 --> 30:47.088
No, that's--
that's what it means.

30:47.132 --> 30:48.480
Really.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.002
Well, agree to disagree.

30:55.394 --> 30:57.351
May I take your order?

30:57.351 --> 31:00.700
Yes, I am going to have
three fingers of Glenlivet

31:00.743 --> 31:03.614
with a little bit of pepper,
and, uh, some cheese.

31:03.658 --> 31:05.571
Very good.

31:05.571 --> 31:07.528
A Manhattan,
and kick the vermouth

31:07.528 --> 31:09.659
in the side with a pair
of steel-toed boots.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.573
- Certainly.
- Thank you, Scott.

31:11.573 --> 31:13.616
Thank you.

31:13.616 --> 31:16.182
Wow.
Quite a drink order.

31:16.226 --> 31:19.400
Oh, well, when in Rome.

31:19.444 --> 31:21.010
Yes?

31:21.010 --> 31:22.924
Please, go on.

31:22.924 --> 31:26.402
Uh, do as the Romans do?

31:26.446 --> 31:28.185
It's an old expression.

31:28.185 --> 31:30.403
Oh! I've never heard of it.

31:30.446 --> 31:32.230
- Oh.
- It's wonderful, though.

31:32.230 --> 31:34.492
Mr. Burgundy.

31:34.535 --> 31:36.928
- Tino! How are you?
- So good to see you.

31:36.971 --> 31:38.623
You're looking fantastic.

31:38.623 --> 31:40.623
Tino, Veronica.

31:40.623 --> 31:43.233
Veronica.
What a pretty girlfriend.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.277
- Drinks are on Tino tonight.
- No, no, no.

31:45.277 --> 31:47.755
We're work associates.
I work at the station.

31:47.799 --> 31:50.931
- I'm a journalist.
- Oh, okay. This is a good guy.

31:50.975 --> 31:53.105
Tino's the finest
club owner in the city.

31:53.149 --> 31:54.714
- My best friend, right?
- Yes.

31:54.714 --> 31:57.846
Yes, we have a saying
in my country about people like him.

31:57.889 --> 32:00.411
"The coyote of the desert

32:00.499 --> 32:02.673
always likes to eat
the heart of the young,

32:02.717 --> 32:06.456
where the blood drips down to children
for breakfast, lunch and dinner,

32:06.500 --> 32:09.283
- only the ribs will be broken in two."
- Tino.

32:09.327 --> 32:12.066
Okay. Well, Mr. Burgundy,
we will be honored

32:12.110 --> 32:14.807
if you will play
"yazz" flute for us.

32:14.851 --> 32:16.764
- I can't.
- Please.

32:16.764 --> 32:18.937
You play jazz flute?

32:18.981 --> 32:21.113
- I dabble.
- Oh.

32:21.156 --> 32:24.288
Would everyone love to hear
Ron Burgundy play "yazz" flute?

32:24.331 --> 32:27.593
- Get it goin', Ronnie!
- Yes! Please.

32:27.636 --> 32:28.854
You, on stage now.

32:28.854 --> 32:31.637
Okay, I guess I can play
a little ditty.

32:31.681 --> 32:33.420
- Honestly, I'm--
- Come on.

32:33.420 --> 32:37.117
- Give him a hand.
- I'm not prepared. Not at all.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.987
- Yeah!
- This is a surprise, I'll tell you.

32:41.379 --> 32:44.032
Guys, "East Harlem
Shakedown," E flat?

32:44.076 --> 32:45.684
Keep the cymbals splashy,

32:45.684 --> 32:47.815
and, Jay, let's take
the bass line for a walk.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.512
Hold on.

32:53.512 --> 32:56.384
I'm not hearing it right.
Hold on.

33:03.689 --> 33:05.776
We got it now.
It's all right.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.908
Fire up, Ronnie!

33:09.561 --> 33:13.083
Little "Ham and Eggs" comin' at you.
Hope you got your griddles.

33:19.824 --> 33:22.172
That's baby-makin' music,
that's what that is.

33:28.217 --> 33:30.652
Let's go!

34:12.620 --> 34:14.708
Hey, Aqualung!

34:27.145 --> 34:28.320
Thank you.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.408
Thank you!

34:36.844 --> 34:39.409
You were amazing.

34:39.454 --> 34:41.322
Mm. Thank you.

34:41.322 --> 34:43.454
Where did you learn
to play like that?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.193
Well, jazz flute

34:45.193 --> 34:48.237
has always been a small
passion of mine.

34:48.324 --> 34:51.283
So what other passions
do you have, Mr. Burgundy?

34:51.326 --> 34:56.065
Well, I have one
great passion that--

34:56.110 --> 35:00.590
that lives deep
within my loins, like a--

35:00.634 --> 35:04.633
Like a flaming golden hawk:

35:04.677 --> 35:07.809
To one day
become a network anchor.

35:07.852 --> 35:10.941
Well, believe it or not,

35:10.984 --> 35:13.028
we share the same dream.

35:14.027 --> 35:16.071
I too want to be
an network anchor.

35:17.855 --> 35:19.986
God, you are so beautiful.

35:24.595 --> 35:26.683
We really
should be going.

35:26.727 --> 35:29.814
I swore that I would never
get involved with a coworker.

35:31.511 --> 35:33.599
Wait.

35:35.598 --> 35:38.600
What if, just for tonight,
we weren't coworkers?

35:38.687 --> 35:41.426
We were co-people?

35:42.513 --> 35:44.557
- I don't--
- Shh.

35:45.819 --> 35:47.906
You be a woman.

35:47.950 --> 35:50.342
I'll be a man.

35:50.385 --> 35:52.473
That's all.

35:53.081 --> 35:54.690
Oh.

35:54.690 --> 35:57.822
You continue to surprise
me, Mr. Burgundy.

36:18.391 --> 36:21.741
Oh, I'm storming your castle
on my steed, milady.

36:26.395 --> 36:29.222
Oh, mi corazón
es en fuego!

36:29.266 --> 36:31.527
Julio, fuego,
fuego, fuego!

36:31.570 --> 36:33.875
Wait, stop.
Stop talking like that.

36:33.918 --> 36:36.440
- I can't understand you.
- Sorry.

36:40.877 --> 36:42.877
Take me to Pleasure Town!

36:42.877 --> 36:44.964

Tip of the cap to you as well,
Miss Corningstone.

37:46.504 --> 37:49.069
I'm having very strong feelings
for you, Mr. Burgundy.

37:49.113 --> 37:50.679
Mm.

37:50.679 --> 37:54.071

that I be viewed as a professional.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.768
doesn't really apply
to what I'm talking about.

38:04.812 --> 38:06.855
- Oh, I'm--
- What I was saying.

38:06.855 --> 38:09.857
I still don't quite
understand what it means.

38:09.857 --> 38:12.119
Oh, no.
You'll find it.

38:14.510 --> 38:16.511
No, I was saying that,

38:16.511 --> 38:18.598
if we continue
seeing each other,

38:18.641 --> 38:22.382
that we should keep it
relatively quiet around the station.

38:22.426 --> 38:24.208
Absolutely,

38:24.208 --> 38:26.862
my wild love tigress.

38:30.166 --> 38:32.299
Tasteful discretion
is the name of the game.

38:32.341 --> 38:34.428
Mm-hmm.

38:36.734 --> 38:39.735
Veronica Corningstone
and I had sex,

38:39.735 --> 38:42.908
and now we are in love!

38:43.952 --> 38:46.171
Did I say that loud?

38:46.214 --> 38:48.475
Yeah, you pretty much
yelled it.

38:48.519 --> 38:50.607
Well, I can't help it.

38:50.607 --> 38:52.172
It's fantastic!

38:52.172 --> 38:55.303
- What's it like, Ron?
- The intimate times?

38:55.347 --> 38:57.825
Outta sight, my man!

38:59.217 --> 39:02.610
No. The other thing.

39:02.654 --> 39:04.219
Love.

39:04.219 --> 39:06.872
Yeah.
What is that?

39:06.915 --> 39:10.699
Well, it's tough to explain.

39:10.743 --> 39:14.614
- I think I was in love once.
- Really, what was her name?

39:14.656 --> 39:16.091
I don't remember.

39:16.091 --> 39:19.049
That's not a good start,
but keep going.

39:19.093 --> 39:21.136
She was Brazilian.

39:21.136 --> 39:23.572
Or Chinese,
or something weird.

39:23.615 --> 39:26.573
I met her in the bathroom
of a K-mart,

39:26.616 --> 39:28.791
and we made out for hours.

39:28.834 --> 39:32.227
Then we parted ways,
never to see each other again.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.706
I'm pretty sure
that's not love.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.140
Damn it!

39:36.140 --> 39:38.228
I love...

39:39.533 --> 39:41.621
carpet.

39:43.404 --> 39:46.100
I love desk.

39:46.143 --> 39:49.970
Are you just looking at things
in the office and saying you love them?

39:49.970 --> 39:51.839
I love lamp.

39:51.839 --> 39:55.581
Do you really love the lamp,
or are you saying it because you saw it?

39:55.624 --> 39:59.320
I love lamp!
I love lamp.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.582
You really want to know
what love is?

40:01.626 --> 40:03.886
- Yeah.
- Yes, tell us.

40:03.930 --> 40:06.019
More than anything
in the world.

40:06.887 --> 40:09.802
Well, it's really
quite simple.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.454
It's kind of like...

40:15.021 --> 40:18.108

Sounds like you have
mental problems, man.

41:10.557 --> 41:13.296
- Yeah, you got mental problems, man.

Oh, look out.
Next up, it's Whiskerus Maximus.

41:31.824 --> 41:33.867
He's ready to do battle
in the arena

41:33.867 --> 41:36.694
against the tiniest lion
you've ever imagined.

41:38.564 --> 41:41.087
I'm getting some great stuff,
Miss Corningstone.

41:41.129 --> 41:43.348
Shut up.

41:43.391 --> 41:45.218
Oh, I hate cats.

41:45.218 --> 41:47.827
Let's just do my sign-off
and get outta here.

41:49.089 --> 41:51.697
It was quite a show
down here at the Pet Shack.

41:51.741 --> 41:55.872
Just for today, fashion curiosity
did not kill the cat.

41:55.917 --> 41:59.396
I'm Veronica Corningstone
for Channel 4 News.

41:59.440 --> 42:03.049
That was our newest reporter,
Veronica Corningstone.

42:03.093 --> 42:04.745
She's really great.

42:04.745 --> 42:07.963
I'd also like to share with you
that we are currently dating

42:08.006 --> 42:10.704
and that she is quite
a handful in the bedroom.

42:10.748 --> 42:12.573
Uh...

42:12.573 --> 42:15.227
That's gonna do it
for all of us here at 6:00.

42:15.270 --> 42:17.966
For the Channel 4 News Team,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

42:18.010 --> 42:20.097
You stay classy,
San Diego.

42:21.053 --> 42:23.097
All clear.

42:23.097 --> 42:25.185
Uh-oh.

42:25.185 --> 42:27.881
I might be in trouble
on that one.

42:27.925 --> 42:31.839
I can't believe that you said
that we were dating on the air.

42:31.883 --> 42:35.535
Mmm! Mmm.
That is good fondue.

42:35.579 --> 42:38.928
Don't you get it, Ron?
I wanna be an anchor.

42:38.971 --> 42:41.407
That is never gonna happen
if everyone in San Diego

42:41.451 --> 42:43.450
thinks that I'm
your bimbo gal pal.

42:43.450 --> 42:45.452
I don't know what to say.

42:45.452 --> 42:48.061
I just--
I got excited.

42:48.104 --> 42:52.235
I just wanted to shout it
from on top of a mountain.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.498
But I didn't have a mountain.
I had a newsroom and a camera.

42:55.540 --> 42:57.063
Look.

42:57.063 --> 42:59.063
I report the news.
That's what I do.

42:59.063 --> 43:03.456
And today's top story,
in Ron Burgundy's world,

43:03.456 --> 43:05.718
read something like this:

43:05.762 --> 43:08.197
I love Veronica Corningstone.

43:12.329 --> 43:14.416
Oh, Ron.

43:18.807 --> 43:20.808
This is nice, gang, sittin' here.

43:20.808 --> 43:23.200
- Oh, yeah.
- Brown baggin' it.

43:23.244 --> 43:26.723
The team pancake breakfast is tomorrow
morning at 9:00 instead of 8:00.

43:26.767 --> 43:28.768
Oh! Almost forgot.

43:28.768 --> 43:31.072
I won't be able
to make it, fellas.

43:31.115 --> 43:33.464
Veronica and I are trying
this new fad called,

43:33.508 --> 43:35.421
uh, jogging.

43:35.421 --> 43:38.901
I believe it's jogging or yogging.
It might be a soft "J."

43:38.943 --> 43:41.640
I'm not sure,
but apparently you just run

43:41.684 --> 43:43.815
for an extended period
of time.

43:43.858 --> 43:46.338
- It's supposed to be wild.
- So Ron's not coming?

43:46.380 --> 43:48.033
No, Ron's coming.

43:48.033 --> 43:51.121
It's the pancake breakfast.
We do it every month.

43:51.164 --> 43:53.035
I realize that.

43:53.035 --> 43:56.687
Sometimes you gotta look yourself
in the mirror and say, "When in Rome."

43:56.731 --> 43:58.818
The bottom line is,

43:58.862 --> 44:01.906
you've been spending
a lot of time with this lady.

44:01.950 --> 44:05.820
You're a member of
the Channel 4 News Team.

44:05.864 --> 44:08.343
- That's a given.
- We need you.

44:09.779 --> 44:11.866
Hell, I need you.

44:13.127 --> 44:15.345
I'm a mess without ya.

44:15.388 --> 44:17.781
I miss you
so damn much.

44:17.824 --> 44:20.562
I miss being with you.

44:20.606 --> 44:24.216
I miss being near you.
I miss your laugh.

44:29.741 --> 44:31.914
I miss--
I miss your scent.

44:31.958 --> 44:34.567
I miss your musk.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.654
When this all gets sorted out,

44:39.698 --> 44:42.700
I think you and me should
get an apartment together.

44:44.743 --> 44:47.222
Just take it easy, Champ.

44:47.266 --> 44:49.702
Why don't you stop talking
for a while?

44:49.745 --> 44:51.919
Maybe sit the next
couple of plays out.

44:51.963 --> 44:53.529
You know what I mean?

44:53.529 --> 44:55.530
Yeah, I'm gonna quit
sayin' things

44:55.530 --> 44:57.877
when they crop up
in the ol' skull, huh?

44:57.921 --> 45:00.835
See what it's like
when you're not here?

45:00.879 --> 45:03.879
You're our leader.
Look what you're doing to the group.

45:03.922 --> 45:06.271
Champ's been a mess.
Brick can't sleep at night.

45:06.314 --> 45:08.489
Here's the thing,

45:08.533 --> 45:10.360
I don't trust this chick.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.056
We need you around,
and she is just using you.

45:13.100 --> 45:15.273
Everyone, just relax.
All right?

45:15.317 --> 45:19.405
Believe me, if there's one thing
Ron Burgundy knows, it's women.

45:19.797 --> 45:22.058
I don't know, Ron.

45:22.102 --> 45:24.320
Guess what.
I do.

45:24.363 --> 45:27.711
I know that one day, Veronica
and I are gonna get married

45:27.755 --> 45:30.146
on top of a mountain.

45:30.190 --> 45:32.278
And there's going
to be flutes playing

45:32.322 --> 45:35.191
and trombones and flowers

45:35.234 --> 45:37.758
and garlands of fresh herbs.

45:39.107 --> 45:42.368
And we will dance
till the sun rises.

45:42.411 --> 45:45.195
And then our children
will form a family band.

45:45.237 --> 45:47.238
And we will tour
the countryside,

45:47.238 --> 45:49.326
and you won't be invited!

45:52.239 --> 45:55.937
I'm telling you, this lady has really
crawled into Ron's head.

45:59.415 --> 46:02.634
Good.
Good one!

46:02.677 --> 46:04.591
Oh, okay.
I understand.

46:04.591 --> 46:07.505
You have a nice day,
sir. Bye.

46:07.549 --> 46:10.288
Um, I could come back
later, Mr. Harken.

46:10.332 --> 46:11.767
No, no, no.

46:11.767 --> 46:13.506
It's just parent stuff.

46:13.506 --> 46:16.159
It seems that our youngest,
Chris, was

46:16.203 --> 46:18.030
on something called acid

46:18.030 --> 46:20.595
and was firing
a bow and arrow into a crowd.

46:20.638 --> 46:22.725
- Mm.
- You know how kids are.

46:22.769 --> 46:24.639
Oh. Right.

46:24.639 --> 46:27.336
Anyhoo, what can
I do you for?

46:27.380 --> 46:28.684
Well, Mr. Harken,

46:28.684 --> 46:31.685
I feel like I have proven
myself as a journalist

46:31.772 --> 46:33.773
and that I deserve
the opportunity

46:33.773 --> 46:35.904
to take on more
challenging stories.

46:35.946 --> 46:38.078
Well, ask
and you shall receive.

46:38.122 --> 46:41.428
Ah, yes, this just
came across my desk.

46:41.470 --> 46:43.862
Here is a story
of a 103-year-old woman

46:43.906 --> 46:47.732
who claims to have a recipe
for the world's greatest meat loaf.

46:47.776 --> 46:49.863
Ooh, now that's
a hot lead.

46:49.907 --> 46:53.213
It was very hard for Veronica.

46:53.255 --> 46:55.952
But she was a pro
and hung tough.

46:55.952 --> 46:59.301
But soon, with a simple act
of littering,

46:59.343 --> 47:01.867
everyone's life
would change forever.

47:23.612 --> 47:25.700

47:32.352 --> 47:34.659
Goddamn son of--

47:36.007 --> 47:37.615
What the hell, bro'?

47:37.615 --> 47:39.833
Hello, neighbor.

47:39.877 --> 47:42.095
Did you just throw a burrito
out your window?

47:42.139 --> 47:43.356
I believe I did.

47:43.356 --> 47:46.314
Are you high or something?
Did you see what happened?

47:46.357 --> 47:49.140
I did. That was a terrific spill.
That's quite a raspberry.

47:49.183 --> 47:51.923
That's my chopper
you just thrashed, Broseph.

47:51.967 --> 47:55.490
Easy, compadre. I'm your
friend out here, all right?

47:55.534 --> 47:58.969
I want you to fix my chopper
before I stomp your goofy ass!

47:59.011 --> 48:01.057
If you want
to throw down, fine.

48:01.057 --> 48:04.448
I've got Jack Johnson
and Tom O'Leary waiting for you.

48:04.492 --> 48:06.797
You destroyed
the only thing I love.

48:06.840 --> 48:09.972
All right? There it is.
What do you love?

48:10.016 --> 48:12.103
I love poetry.

48:12.103 --> 48:14.364
And a glass of Scotch.

48:14.408 --> 48:17.191
And, of course,
my friend Baxter here.

48:17.235 --> 48:19.931
Well, guess what.
Now this is happenin'.

48:19.975 --> 48:22.975
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What are you doing?

48:25.672 --> 48:28.151
That's how I roll.

48:29.281 --> 48:32.195
Baxter!

48:32.239 --> 48:36.022
No...!

48:37.805 --> 48:40.066
- Where the hell is he?
- He'll be here.

48:41.806 --> 48:44.633
- I thought he was Mr. Dependable.
- It's not like Ron.

48:44.676 --> 48:48.287
I'd put Brick on, but unless he's
tracking a storm front, he's useless.

48:48.330 --> 48:50.156
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Oh. Hello.

48:50.156 --> 48:53.549
Just want you to know if Ron does not
show up, I am ready to go on.

48:53.592 --> 48:55.941
You and I have had this discussion
a million times.

48:55.984 --> 48:57.767
There's never been
a woman anchor.

48:57.767 --> 48:59.245
Mr. Harken,

48:59.245 --> 49:02.246
- this city needs its news.
- Oh.

49:02.246 --> 49:05.378
You're gonna deprive them
of that because I have breasts?

49:05.422 --> 49:06.943
Exquisite breasts?

49:06.943 --> 49:11.335
I am gonna go on,
and if you want to stop me, bring it on.

49:11.379 --> 49:13.423
Because I am good
at three things:

49:13.466 --> 49:15.772
fighting, screwing
and reading the news.

49:15.815 --> 49:19.555
I've already done one of those today,
so what's the other one gonna be?

49:21.774 --> 49:23.121
Uh--

49:23.121 --> 49:25.208
Screwing?

49:28.297 --> 49:31.210
I will be in makeup.

49:32.645 --> 49:34.777
Jesus, she's terrifying!

49:34.820 --> 49:38.257
Fantana.

49:39.387 --> 49:40.734
Ron, are you okay?

49:40.734 --> 49:42.822
The man punted Baxter!

49:42.822 --> 49:44.909
Calm down.

49:44.953 --> 49:46.649
Breathe, Ron,
breathe.

49:46.649 --> 49:49.128
The man that loved
the motorcycle!

49:49.172 --> 49:51.042
What did the bad man do?

49:51.042 --> 49:55.173
The motorcycle on the bridge!
I hit him with a burrito!

49:55.217 --> 49:56.521
- Ron!
- He took him!

49:56.521 --> 49:59.870
He took him with his foot
and he kicked him!

49:59.914 --> 50:01.348
That's what he did!

50:01.348 --> 50:02.698
Someone punted him?

50:02.698 --> 50:05.438
No, wait. Wait.
Let me say something.

50:05.481 --> 50:10.829
Let me say something.

50:10.873 --> 50:13.874
What?

50:16.657 --> 50:19.788
I-- I don't-- I didn't
understand one word you said.

50:19.832 --> 50:22.224
Ron, are you okay?
Ron?

50:28.617 --> 50:30.835
Ron.
Where are you?

50:30.878 --> 50:34.532
I'm in a glass case
of emotion!

50:34.575 --> 50:36.663
He's gonna put
Corningstone on.

50:36.663 --> 50:39.143
He's gonna
put Corningstone on!

50:41.186 --> 50:43.273
I've got to do the news!

50:57.016 --> 50:59.104
You're not Ron.

51:00.713 --> 51:03.409
We're on in 10.
Good luck, lady.

51:03.409 --> 51:05.497
Ready the announce.

51:09.367 --> 51:11.541
- Power.
- Roll in.

51:11.585 --> 51:13.673
Power.
Power.

51:17.847 --> 51:20.110
One slip,

51:20.153 --> 51:22.631
and you're gone.
Whammy.

51:22.675 --> 51:25.023
And your reporter in the field,

51:25.067 --> 51:26.415
Brian Fantana.

51:26.415 --> 51:29.286
It's Channel 4 News
at 6:00.

51:31.112 --> 51:33.678
Good evening.
Ron Burgundy is off tonight.

51:35.069 --> 51:37.548
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

51:37.592 --> 51:39.114
Tonight's top story:

51:39.114 --> 51:41.594
- Okay, we're off and running.
- Three armed men

51:41.638 --> 51:45.333
wearing ski masks made off with over
$20,000 from an area bank

51:45.376 --> 51:47.463
in a daring
early morning robbery.

51:52.465 --> 51:53.900
Hey!

51:53.900 --> 51:57.076
And the winner of the frog-leaping
contest was Hoppy,

51:57.119 --> 52:00.032
with a jump
of seven feet, 10 inches.

52:00.076 --> 52:01.945
Hmm.

52:01.945 --> 52:06.078
I used to date a guy named Hoppy down
in Alabama. He was quite a jumper, too.

52:08.122 --> 52:10.340
That will do it
for us at 6:00.

52:10.384 --> 52:12.906
From all of us here
at Channel 4 News,

52:12.950 --> 52:15.167
I'm Veronica Corningstone,

52:15.210 --> 52:18.341
and thanks
for stopping by, San Diego.

52:18.385 --> 52:19.734
All clear!

52:19.734 --> 52:22.517
Yes! Yes!

52:23.647 --> 52:25.822
Lady! Lady!

52:25.866 --> 52:28.736
Not bad, Miss Corningstone.
Not bad at all.

52:28.779 --> 52:30.911
Thank you, Mr. Harken.
That felt good.

52:30.954 --> 52:33.867
- That felt really good.
- I liked your sign-off line, too.

52:33.911 --> 52:36.868
You did? It just came through me.
It was so organic.

52:36.912 --> 52:39.000
Thank you.

52:40.478 --> 52:42.479
Oh, Ron! Ron!
Ron, darling!

52:42.479 --> 52:45.174
I'm so glad you're
all right. Oh, God.

52:45.218 --> 52:47.131
I have something
magnificent to tell you.

52:47.131 --> 52:49.567
I'm here.
We can do the news now.

52:49.611 --> 52:52.437
It's all right, everyone!
We can do the news.

52:52.480 --> 52:55.309
Hold on. Why are we all standing around?
Let's go!

52:55.352 --> 52:58.440
Ron, we did it.
Veronica filled in for you.

52:58.483 --> 52:59.831
What?

52:59.831 --> 53:01.918
Sweetheart, we were
so worried about you,

53:01.962 --> 53:04.789
and we waited as long
as we could, but--

53:04.833 --> 53:08.789
Darling, I did the news,
and I nailed it. I nailed it.

53:08.833 --> 53:13.443
Wait, wait! Veronica, please,
tell me this is some kind

53:13.487 --> 53:15.966
of sick, tasteless joke.

53:16.010 --> 53:18.313
You weren't here.
Why are you being this way?

53:18.357 --> 53:20.359
Why can't you
be proud of me

53:20.359 --> 53:23.141
as a peer and as
my gentleman lover?

53:23.141 --> 53:24.707
Oh, Jeez.

53:24.707 --> 53:27.533
I can't believe
you did this to me!

53:27.577 --> 53:29.578
You read my news!

53:29.578 --> 53:32.622
I told you that I wanted
to be an anchor.

53:32.666 --> 53:34.233
I told you that.

53:34.233 --> 53:36.667
I thought you were kidding!

53:36.710 --> 53:38.711
I thought it was a joke!

53:38.711 --> 53:41.015
I even wrote it down
in my diary!

53:41.059 --> 53:44.277
"Veronica had
a very funny joke today."

53:44.320 --> 53:46.366
I laughed at it
later that night!

53:46.366 --> 53:48.670
I can't believe
that I cared for you.

53:48.713 --> 53:50.715
Get out! Just go!

53:50.715 --> 53:53.498
We are through!
Through!

53:53.541 --> 53:56.497
Because of your actions,
you scorpion woman!

53:56.541 --> 53:59.455
You have broken my heart,
Mr. Burgundy.

53:59.499 --> 54:01.630
You have broken my heart.

54:05.891 --> 54:07.675
From there on out,

54:07.675 --> 54:10.197
things just got worse
for Ron Burgundy.

54:10.241 --> 54:12.328
Corningstone was a star,

54:12.328 --> 54:15.200
and everything started
to move awfully fast

54:15.243 --> 54:17.895
- after her big break.
- Where's Ian? Ian!

54:17.895 --> 54:20.374
All right, I got a call from network.

54:20.417 --> 54:22.810
It looks like
our broadcast last night

54:22.852 --> 54:25.853
received a two-point
ratings boost,

54:25.941 --> 54:28.333
and the decision
has been passed down

54:28.376 --> 54:31.160
to make Veronica
our co-anchor.

54:31.202 --> 54:33.247
- What?
- No. No!

54:33.247 --> 54:35.334
No!

54:35.377 --> 54:37.117
- No!
- No!

54:37.117 --> 54:38.553
- No!
- This is wonderful.

54:38.553 --> 54:42.032
Ed, come here,
you big silly man. You big silly man.

54:42.118 --> 54:45.033
- We did it.
- What is this, amateur hour?

54:48.425 --> 54:51.078
- That's great.
- Thank you.

What Brian didn't tell you

55:21.086 --> 55:24.086
was that those
were not real pirates.

55:24.130 --> 55:26.609
- They looked convincing, though.
- Oh, yes.

55:26.653 --> 55:29.218
Well, for all of us here
at Channel 4 News,

55:29.262 --> 55:30.654
I'm Ron Burgundy.

55:30.654 --> 55:32.653
You stay classy,
San Diego.

55:32.653 --> 55:34.697
And thanks
for stopping by.

55:34.697 --> 55:36.743
But mainly stay classy.

55:36.743 --> 55:39.482
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy, I'm Ron Burgundy.

55:39.524 --> 55:41.396
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy.

55:41.396 --> 55:43.962
Ron Burgundy.

55:46.310 --> 55:49.397
You are a real hooker,
and I'm gonna slap you in public.

55:55.225 --> 55:58.443
You have man boobs.

55:58.486 --> 56:00.836
You've got a dirty,
whorish mouth.

56:05.185 --> 56:07.576
I'm gonna punch you
in the ovary.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.751
- A straight shot.
- Ooh, ow.

56:09.794 --> 56:11.838
Right to the baby-maker.

56:11.838 --> 56:14.926
Ah, jazz flute
is for little fairy boys.

56:14.970 --> 56:17.057
Okay, you know what?
That's uncalled for.

56:17.100 --> 56:19.319
I can't work with this woman.
It's terrible.

56:20.971 --> 56:23.929
It's ringing.

56:25.277 --> 56:27.103
Veronica Corningstone.

56:27.103 --> 56:30.147
Hello, Veronica,
this is Mike Rithjin

56:30.190 --> 56:32.495
from the network.
You've just been promoted.

56:32.539 --> 56:34.671
You're gonna need to move
to Moscow.

56:34.713 --> 56:36.497
Start cleaning up your desk.

56:36.497 --> 56:38.846
See you in the morning.
We'll pick you up in a van.

56:38.888 --> 56:40.497
What did you say
your name was?

56:40.497 --> 56:42.716
Mike Ritnitjun.
It's not important.

56:42.759 --> 56:44.281
Start cleaning your desk,

56:44.325 --> 56:46.760
and we'll pick you up
in the morning.

56:46.804 --> 56:49.108
Tell her she might
want to get a coat.

56:49.108 --> 56:51.761
Hold on. Veronica?
What was it?

56:51.805 --> 56:53.327
Tell her to get a coat.

56:53.327 --> 56:56.502
Also, I don't know if you know Moscow.
It's pretty cold.

56:56.502 --> 56:58.069
You might want
to buy a coat.

56:58.069 --> 57:00.373
Are you and Champ
having a good time, Ron?

57:00.416 --> 57:01.547
Are we what?

57:01.547 --> 57:03.677
I can see you, Ron.

57:03.721 --> 57:05.113
What?

57:05.113 --> 57:08.113
I can see you.

57:08.157 --> 57:10.549
Okay. Bye-bye.

57:10.593 --> 57:12.681
- What happened?
- She knew it was me.

57:16.508 --> 57:18.944
You're watching Channel 4 News

57:18.944 --> 57:21.291
with five-time
Emmy award-winning anchor

57:21.335 --> 57:23.423
Ron Burgundy
and Tits McGee.

57:24.856 --> 57:27.728
Good evening, San Diego.
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

57:27.771 --> 57:29.858
Tits McGee is on vacation.

57:33.164 --> 57:35.208
And I'm Tits--
I'm Ron Burgundy.

57:38.818 --> 57:41.340
- Veronica Corningstone.
- This is your doctor.

57:41.340 --> 57:44.514
I have your pregnancy
report here, and guess what.

57:44.558 --> 57:47.820
You got knocked up.
You should probably get out of news.

57:47.864 --> 57:50.343
- Who is this?
- This is Dr. Chim.

57:50.386 --> 57:53.822
- Dr. Chim Richalds.
- Ron, is this you?

57:53.865 --> 57:56.126
I'm a professional doctor.

57:56.170 --> 57:58.691
You saw me.
You don't remember.

57:58.736 --> 58:01.737
We-- you should move.

58:01.780 --> 58:03.999
- Get out of the business.
- This is pathetic.

58:03.999 --> 58:06.129
You're pathetic.

58:06.172 --> 58:07.826
What'd she say?

58:07.826 --> 58:10.262
She-- I don't--
I think she bought it.

58:10.305 --> 58:12.741
She's looking this way.

58:12.783 --> 58:15.914
- Oh, uh-oh. Whoa!
- Here she comes.

58:20.089 --> 58:22.568
I'll tell you what,
it's just not working.

58:22.612 --> 58:25.004
She's making us look like
a bunch of fools.

58:25.047 --> 58:28.091
Ellen, where's the party?

58:29.180 --> 58:31.876
Children, grow up.

58:32.962 --> 58:34.962
Son of a bee sting.

58:34.962 --> 58:37.094
She's turning
the entire office against us.

58:37.137 --> 58:39.747
- This is grim. Real grim.
- What are we gonna do?

58:39.791 --> 58:42.051
There's only one thing
a man can do

58:42.051 --> 58:46.010
when he's suffering from a spiritual
and existential funk.

58:46.054 --> 58:48.272
Go to the zoo,
flip off the monkeys?

58:48.314 --> 58:50.924
No. Buy new suits.

58:50.968 --> 58:52.751
Yea!

58:52.751 --> 58:54.881

Where's the suit store?
We've been walking for 45 minutes.

59:06.101 --> 59:08.537
Brick, I thought you said
this was a shortcut.

59:08.581 --> 59:09.886
Fantastic.

59:09.886 --> 59:12.364
- Is it a shortcut or not?
- Okay.

59:13.495 --> 59:15.582
Jeez.

59:18.235 --> 59:20.061
Hey.

59:20.104 --> 59:23.714
Uh-oh.
Here comes trouble.

59:26.150 --> 59:28.847
Burgundy and the ladies
went out for a stroll, huh?

59:30.325 --> 59:33.327
You boys walkin' around
and talkin' things through?

59:33.327 --> 59:35.414
Keep a tight perimeter.

59:37.197 --> 59:39.284
Yes, sirree.

59:40.110 --> 59:42.198
Well, well, well.

59:43.155 --> 59:45.112
Ron Burgundy

59:45.112 --> 59:47.112
and the Channel 4
News Team.

59:47.112 --> 59:49.113
Where's your mommy?

59:49.113 --> 59:51.592
You back off,
Evening News Team.

59:56.375 --> 59:58.593
You know,
I understand that, uh,

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.116
they had to bring
a female in.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.856
Change your diapers.

01:00:03.856 --> 01:00:06.379
Wipe the dribble away
from your bubblin' lips.

01:00:08.075 --> 01:00:09.989
Rub Vaseline
all over your heinie

01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:13.294
and tell you that it's special
and different from everyone else's.

01:00:15.207 --> 01:00:17.425
He said "heinie"!

01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:19.164
Brick, get back over here!

01:00:19.164 --> 01:00:20.642
Heinie!

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:22.730
Does she tuck you in, Ronnie?

01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:26.166
Give you a little kiss
on your forehead?

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.079
Tell you everything's
gonna be okay?

01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:30.340
I've had enough
of you, Mantooth.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.386
This is gonna end
right here, right now.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.255
Let's dance, dickweed.

01:00:35.255 --> 01:00:37.342
You wanna dance, Ronnie?

01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:42.780
I wanna polka.

01:00:51.042 --> 01:00:53.521
Come get a taste.

01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:59.306
Brick, where'd you get
a hand grenade?

01:00:59.306 --> 01:01:01.392
I don't know.

01:01:02.306 --> 01:01:05.351
All right.
Let's do this!

01:01:06.568 --> 01:01:08.655
Hey!

01:01:11.352 --> 01:01:13.353
If you're gonna have a fight,

01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:15.745
then don't forget
Channel 2 News with me,

01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:18.048
lead anchor Frank Vitchard.

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:21.354
You dirtbags have been
in third place for five years.

01:01:21.354 --> 01:01:25.225
Yeah? Well, you're about
to be in dead place.

01:01:30.922 --> 01:01:34.967
Not so fast, you ingrates!

01:01:35.011 --> 01:01:38.098
Public News Team is taking
a break from its pledge drive

01:01:38.142 --> 01:01:39.794
to kick some ass.

01:01:39.794 --> 01:01:42.012
No commercials!
No mercy!

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:57.277
Cómo están, pinches!

01:01:57.277 --> 01:01:59.364
Spanish Language News is here.

01:01:59.408 --> 01:02:00.800
Tonight's top story:

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.236
The sewers run red
with Burgundy's blood.

01:02:04.236 --> 01:02:06.323
Hyah! Hyah!

01:02:12.672 --> 01:02:16.021
Well looks like we got
ourselves a bilingual bloodfest.

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:26.590
Now, before we do this,
let's go over the ground rules.

01:02:28.894 --> 01:02:31.112
Rule number one:

01:02:31.156 --> 01:02:33.853
No touching
of the hair or face.

01:02:34.896 --> 01:02:36.114
Of course.

01:02:36.114 --> 01:02:38.288
And that's it!

01:02:38.332 --> 01:02:40.593
Now let's do this!

01:02:48.725 --> 01:02:51.247
Begin!

01:03:28.997 --> 01:03:31.389
I'm gonna straight-up
murder your ass!

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.520
- Blade!
- Here you go, mate!

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.608
Ahh! God!

01:03:35.651 --> 01:03:38.217
Oh! I did not
see that coming!

01:03:41.913 --> 01:03:44.001
Oh! Aaah!

01:03:44.001 --> 01:03:47.219
- Now I'll be number one.
- No, you won't!

01:03:49.351 --> 01:03:52.221
Policía!

01:04:05.615 --> 01:04:08.617
Boy, that escalated quickly.

01:04:08.659 --> 01:04:11.616
I mean, that really
got out of hand fast.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.270
- It jumped up a notch.
- It did, didn't it?

01:04:14.314 --> 01:04:16.705
Yeah, I stabbed
a man in the heart.

01:04:16.749 --> 01:04:20.314
I saw that.
Brick killed a guy.

01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:22.532
- Did you throw a trident?
- Yeah.

01:04:22.532 --> 01:04:25.926
There were horses and a man on fire
and I killed a guy with a trident.

01:04:25.968 --> 01:04:28.274
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

01:04:28.317 --> 01:04:31.145
Find yourself a safe house
or a relative close by.

01:04:31.187 --> 01:04:35.362
Lay low for a while, because you're
probably wanted for murder.

01:04:35.406 --> 01:04:36.885
I'm proud of you fellas.

01:04:36.885 --> 01:04:38.712
You kept your head
on a swivel.

01:04:38.712 --> 01:04:41.668
That's what you gotta do when
you're in a vicious cockfight.

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:44.495
Can you believe Mantooth and
the Channel 9 Evening News Team?

01:04:44.538 --> 01:04:46.973
"Where's your mommy?
Someone's gotta change your diapers."

01:04:47.017 --> 01:04:49.757
This Corningstone business
is really hurting our rep.

01:04:49.757 --> 01:04:51.758
I know exactly
what you mean, Brian.

01:04:51.758 --> 01:04:54.238
Every newsman in this city's
laughing at us.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.065
- And I don't like it.
- I don't like the put-downs.

01:04:58.108 --> 01:04:59.891
We're gonna do
something about it.

01:04:59.891 --> 01:05:02.457
It is time to put
an end to this!

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.849
Last time I looked, my name's Ron
Burgundy. What's your name?

01:05:05.892 --> 01:05:07.458
- Brian Fantana.
- Champ Kind.

01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:09.155
- Brian Fantana.
- No, you're Brick.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:10.371
- Brian.
- I'm Brian.

01:05:10.371 --> 01:05:11.938
Veronica.

01:05:11.938 --> 01:05:15.286
And I've shown you, old man!

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:18.505
Garth, I need to look at these tapes
for a potential lead.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:20.331
Ron's using the machine

01:05:20.331 --> 01:05:23.070
to play his local Emmy
acceptance speech from last year.

01:05:23.114 --> 01:05:24.983
I tried to ask her
out on a date.

01:05:24.983 --> 01:05:28.724
Turn the music off!
I'm still talking!

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:31.247
- This is ridiculous!
- I don't remember doing it.

01:05:31.334 --> 01:05:33.552
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.901
I need this machine so I can
watch a tape for a story.

01:05:36.943 --> 01:05:39.030
I'm using the tape.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:41.119
I'm showing Jeffrey
my Emmy tape.

01:05:41.119 --> 01:05:42.816
We are watching history.

01:05:42.816 --> 01:05:45.337
Mr. Burgundy,
I'm a professional,

01:05:45.381 --> 01:05:48.947
and I would like
to be able to do my job.

01:05:48.991 --> 01:05:51.121
Big deal!
I am very professional!

01:05:51.164 --> 01:05:53.731
Mr. Burgundy,
you are acting like a baby.

01:05:53.773 --> 01:05:57.471
I'm not a baby, I am a man.
I am an anchorman!

01:05:57.514 --> 01:06:00.385
You are not a man.
You are a big fat joke!

01:06:00.429 --> 01:06:02.386
I'm a man
who discovered the wheel

01:06:02.386 --> 01:06:05.647
and built the Eiffel Tower
out of metal and brawn.

01:06:05.691 --> 01:06:07.475
That's what
kind of man I am.

01:06:07.475 --> 01:06:10.170
You're just a woman
with a small brain.

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:14.042
With a brain a third the size of us.
It's science.

01:06:14.084 --> 01:06:16.999
I will have you know
that I have more talent

01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:19.434
and more intelligence
in my little finger

01:06:19.477 --> 01:06:21.956
than you do
in your entire body, sir!

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.480
You are a smelly
pirate hooker!

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:26.783
You look like a blueberry.

01:06:26.827 --> 01:06:29.914
Why don't you go back
to your home on Whore Island?

01:06:29.958 --> 01:06:33.220
Well, you have bad hair.

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.569
What did you say?

01:06:37.569 --> 01:06:39.352
I said

01:06:39.352 --> 01:06:41.092
your hair

01:06:41.092 --> 01:06:43.874
looks stupid.

01:06:50.746 --> 01:06:54.051
- Let 'em work it out!
- It's between the two of them!

01:07:06.533 --> 01:07:09.056
They're just talking.
Just talking.

01:07:09.098 --> 01:07:11.578
- I hate you!
- I hate you more!

01:07:23.319 --> 01:07:24.884
Ow!

01:07:24.884 --> 01:07:27.451
Shut up! Shut up!

01:07:31.496 --> 01:07:32.931
All right, stop!

01:07:32.931 --> 01:07:34.931
Stop what you're doing
right now!

01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:37.976
I will not have
my newsroom be divided.

01:07:39.498 --> 01:07:41.847
Ah! Knights of Columbus,
that hurts!

01:07:44.064 --> 01:07:46.152
I was like, "Who is that guy?"

01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:52.849
I just can't believe
what Ron did to you.

01:07:52.893 --> 01:07:55.328
It is so awful.

01:07:55.328 --> 01:07:57.373
Yes.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.590
Have you ever thought
about fighting fire

01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:02.982
with fire?

01:08:04.156 --> 01:08:06.027
What do you mean?

01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:10.114
I have some information
that you can choose to use or not use.

01:08:10.157 --> 01:08:11.593
Up to you.

01:08:11.637 --> 01:08:13.811
Ron Burgundy

01:08:13.855 --> 01:08:17.334
will read anything
that is put on that Teleprompter.

01:08:17.377 --> 01:08:19.377
And when I say anything,

01:08:19.377 --> 01:08:21.814
I mean an-y-thing.

01:08:30.599 --> 01:08:31.902
Arnold, cue one.

01:08:31.902 --> 01:08:33.991
After the FotoMat
was destroyed,

01:08:33.991 --> 01:08:36.773
the bear scampered
back into the woods.

01:08:36.817 --> 01:08:39.687
Apparently he wasn't too happy
with his color prints.

01:08:39.731 --> 01:08:41.819
Oh.

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:44.688
From the entire
Channel 4 News Team,

01:08:44.688 --> 01:08:46.470
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:47.863
And I'm Ron Burgundy.

01:08:47.863 --> 01:08:50.430
Go fuck yourself,
San Diego.

01:08:56.474 --> 01:08:58.953
What in the name--

01:08:58.997 --> 01:09:00.997
No!

01:09:00.997 --> 01:09:03.259
Nobody talks about
my city that way!

01:09:03.303 --> 01:09:05.390
Ron Burgundy's ass
is grass!

01:09:08.129 --> 01:09:11.045
Nice work, everyone.
Sharp broadcast.

01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:13.478
Really good.
Everyone on the floor as well.

01:09:13.522 --> 01:09:15.609
Really a lot of hustle.
I liked it.

01:09:16.568 --> 01:09:18.786
Dump out! Dump out!

01:09:18.828 --> 01:09:20.916
Hello, Edward.

01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:23.786
- Ron, I've got to fire you.
- I've got to fire you.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:25.874
Bing, bong, bong.
You're fired, Ed.

01:09:25.874 --> 01:09:28.919
Do you even know
what you just said?

01:09:28.961 --> 01:09:32.180
Great Odin's raven!

01:09:32.223 --> 01:09:34.267
Are you happy, Ron?

01:09:34.267 --> 01:09:37.180
Veronica.
She put that in the Teleprompter.

01:09:37.225 --> 01:09:41.529
You're probably right,
but this is bad, Ron. Real bad.

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:43.618
My hands are tied. I--

01:09:43.618 --> 01:09:45.401
I gotta fire you.

01:09:45.401 --> 01:09:47.880
Ed, let's hold on.
Let's count to 10.

01:09:47.923 --> 01:09:51.662
That's a rash decision.
Is this about something else?

01:09:51.706 --> 01:09:56.055
Ed, there's 300
very angry San Diego-ites.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.578
San Diego-ins.
San Diego-uns.

01:09:58.621 --> 01:10:00.926
- San Dieg-ons.
- San Diegans.

01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:03.188
San Diegans out
in front of the station.

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:05.016
They want Ron's blood.

01:10:05.016 --> 01:10:06.449
They want to hurt you.

01:10:06.449 --> 01:10:09.755
Why did you say that? Why?

01:10:09.755 --> 01:10:12.278
Why, Ron? Why?

01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:14.670
You're my hero, Ron.

01:10:14.714 --> 01:10:16.062
Garth, I--

01:10:16.062 --> 01:10:20.062
And you come out
with stink like that poop!

01:10:20.106 --> 01:10:24.933
You poop mouth!
Get all the poop out of your mouth!

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:28.847
If I were to give you money out
of my wallet, would that ease the pain?

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.065
I hate you, Ron Burgundy!
I hate you!

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:39.937
Ron? Ron!

01:10:40.024 --> 01:10:43.069
I can't believe you did this to me!
Are you happy?

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:44.938
No, Ron, I'm not!

01:10:44.938 --> 01:10:47.112
I have nothing left!
Nothing!

01:10:47.156 --> 01:10:49.331
I've been reduced to rubble!

01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:53.071
Let's go. These people
are about to pull you apart.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:58.681
No! No!

01:11:11.206 --> 01:11:13.598
Mr. Burgundy, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

01:11:13.642 --> 01:11:16.555
- Please, I--
- You're an awful man!

01:11:16.599 --> 01:11:20.426
You are truly a disappointment
to us all, Mr. Burgundy!

01:11:22.383 --> 01:11:24.210
Bob Dylan once wrote,

01:11:24.253 --> 01:11:26.253
"The times,
they are a-changin'."

01:11:26.298 --> 01:11:28.689
Ron Burgundy
had never heard that song.

01:11:28.732 --> 01:11:32.777
So when he fell, he fell hard.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:40.258
It's Channel 4 News at 6:00!

01:11:40.301 --> 01:11:41.910
Good evening, San Diego.

01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:45.520
I'm lead anchor
Veronica Corningstone.

01:11:45.563 --> 01:11:48.650
Tonight's top story:
an ultrasound of Ling Wong,

01:11:48.693 --> 01:11:50.825
the most famous panda
in the world,

01:11:50.868 --> 01:11:53.695
shows that her baby
is doing quite well.

01:11:53.739 --> 01:11:56.827
No!

01:12:02.002 --> 01:12:04.177
Ron Burgundy, stay classy.

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:06.525
Hello, this is Ron.

01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:07.872
Hello.

01:12:07.872 --> 01:12:10.656
Who's there?
I'm talking. Hello.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.354
Who is this?

01:12:12.354 --> 01:12:15.005
Baxter, is that you?

01:12:15.049 --> 01:12:16.440
Baxter!

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.528
Bark twice
if you're in Milwaukee.

01:12:19.529 --> 01:12:21.572
Is this Wilt Chamberlain?

01:12:21.572 --> 01:12:24.660
Have the courage
to say something. Hello!

01:12:26.964 --> 01:12:29.053
Hello!

01:12:34.532 --> 01:12:37.184
Hey, you watch
yourself, mister.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:39.925
Hey, lady in
the red hat. Yeah.

01:12:39.968 --> 01:12:42.056
You smell.

01:12:44.449 --> 01:12:47.796
Guys.
Guys, it's me, Ron.

01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:49.362
Fellas!

01:12:49.362 --> 01:12:51.841
Harken said he'd fire us
if we talked to you.

01:12:51.885 --> 01:12:55.277
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:12:55.321 --> 01:12:57.713
I-- Brian!

01:12:57.713 --> 01:12:59.843
- It's Ronnie!
- Ron!

01:12:59.887 --> 01:13:01.975
- Champ!
- Ron!

01:13:02.018 --> 01:13:04.062
Champ, come on.
Come on!

01:13:04.062 --> 01:13:05.454
Go, Brick.

01:13:05.454 --> 01:13:07.627
My sweet Brick.

01:13:07.671 --> 01:13:10.715
Brick, come hug me.
I know you want to.

01:13:12.326 --> 01:13:15.587
I am completely
miserable, San Diego!

01:13:18.935 --> 01:13:21.023
It's so damn hot!

01:13:23.807 --> 01:13:25.894
Milk was a bad choice!

01:13:33.157 --> 01:13:35.157
Yes, yes.
Chris, listen to me.

01:13:35.157 --> 01:13:38.420
Put down the gun
and let the marching band go.

01:13:38.462 --> 01:13:40.942
We'll play it off as a prank.

01:13:40.942 --> 01:13:43.768
We'll straighten it out later.
I'm getting another call.

01:13:43.768 --> 01:13:45.768
Ed Harken.

01:13:45.768 --> 01:13:47.900
What?
Oh, my God!

01:13:47.944 --> 01:13:52.597
Listen, everybody, Ling Wong
the panda is giving birth!

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.598
Get Corningstone
over there right away!

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.686
The network
is picking up the feed.

01:13:57.686 --> 01:14:00.685
I want a shot
of that panda being born!

01:14:07.384 --> 01:14:09.906
This is Ted Nightingale,
Channel 6 News Los Angeles,

01:14:09.948 --> 01:14:11.601
reporting from
the San Diego Zoo.

01:14:11.601 --> 01:14:13.298
And this is the moment

01:14:13.298 --> 01:14:15.907
the entire world
has been waiting for.

01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:19.169
I can only speculate
as to the sex of the panda,

01:14:19.169 --> 01:14:22.256
but if I had to guess,
I'd say female.

01:14:22.299 --> 01:14:24.561
- Excuse me. Press.
- Hey, lady, watch it.

01:14:24.604 --> 01:14:27.127
Excuse me, I'm press.
Thank you. What do you got?

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:29.433
Nothing. All I can see
is a blue curtain.

01:14:29.475 --> 01:14:31.562
Oh, damn it.

01:14:31.562 --> 01:14:36.043
Go over there and see
if you can get a shot. I'll go this way.

01:14:36.086 --> 01:14:39.131
Hey, lady, why don't you
go fetch me a sandwich?

01:14:39.173 --> 01:14:41.740
Okay, I'll go get your sandwich.

01:14:41.783 --> 01:14:44.959
Then I'll show you the ratings where
you're number two to a woman.

01:14:45.002 --> 01:14:47.829
Ouch. Don't lose
any more hair over it.

01:14:49.046 --> 01:14:51.177
- Whatever.
- We're live, Mr. Mantooth.

01:14:53.048 --> 01:14:55.134
Good afternoon,
San Diego.

01:14:55.178 --> 01:14:57.831
We're here today to celebrate
the birth of a panda.

Creeping out
all the regulars.

01:15:19.141 --> 01:15:23.273
I'm expressing my inner anguish
through the majesty of song!

01:15:23.316 --> 01:15:26.361
Look, drunkie, you been
coming in here every day,

01:15:26.361 --> 01:15:28.492
stinking up the joint
with your craziness.

01:15:28.535 --> 01:15:30.579
Now, what the hell
is wrong with you?

01:15:30.579 --> 01:15:32.579
I got no heart!

01:15:32.579 --> 01:15:34.884
Because a she-devil stole it!

01:15:34.927 --> 01:15:37.537
You know what the worst
part about it is?

01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.668
She's better than me!

01:15:43.192 --> 01:15:45.278
She's better than me.

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.496
You know, times are changing.

01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:51.932
Ladies can do stuff now.

01:15:51.976 --> 01:15:54.803
You're gonna have to learn
how to deal with that.

01:15:54.846 --> 01:15:57.325
What?
Were you saying something?

01:15:57.369 --> 01:15:59.675
Look, I don't
speak Spanish.

01:15:59.717 --> 01:16:01.804
Ah.

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:12.329
Scotty.

01:16:12.329 --> 01:16:14.938
Scotty, I have the shot.

01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:17.027
Scotty. Scotty!

01:16:17.027 --> 01:16:19.027
Hey, uh,

01:16:19.027 --> 01:16:21.983
that is some fantastic
shot you got there.

01:16:22.027 --> 01:16:25.419
The kind of shot that gets you
to the top of network news.

01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:28.855
- Oh, well, we hope.
- We at public television,

01:16:28.899 --> 01:16:33.335
we're really down
with the woman's lib thing.

01:16:33.379 --> 01:16:35.683
That is so refreshing to me.

01:16:35.727 --> 01:16:38.205
Because the struggle I've--

01:16:41.467 --> 01:16:44.773
Howie, we have the shot.

01:16:44.773 --> 01:16:46.773
Up a little.
Up, up.

01:16:46.816 --> 01:16:48.903
Oh.
You son of a bitch!

01:16:48.947 --> 01:16:50.948
Shh!

01:16:50.948 --> 01:16:53.078
Don't want to wake up
your friends.

01:17:04.039 --> 01:17:05.342
Help!

01:17:05.342 --> 01:17:07.952
- Simply vanished.
- How do you lose your lead anchor?

01:17:07.995 --> 01:17:10.474
- I can't find Corningstone.
- Where the hell is she?

01:17:10.517 --> 01:17:12.519
- No one's seen her.
- I can't believe this.

01:17:12.519 --> 01:17:16.041
Every news outlet in the world
is looking for coverage on this.

01:17:16.085 --> 01:17:19.130
I've got no damn lead anchor!

01:17:19.172 --> 01:17:21.608
Damn it! Get me a phone.

01:17:21.652 --> 01:17:24.001
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:28.697
Rocky's,
bar, grill, fine dining.

01:17:28.697 --> 01:17:31.654
- Is there an anchorman there?
- Hold on.

01:17:31.697 --> 01:17:34.481
This is killing me.
I'd rather slit my throat.

01:17:34.524 --> 01:17:37.090
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:17:37.134 --> 01:17:39.134
- Is this Ron?
- Who is this?

01:17:39.134 --> 01:17:41.135
- It's me. Ed.
- Who?

01:17:41.135 --> 01:17:43.657
- Ed Harken.
- I don't know a Ned.

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.962
- Ed Harken!
- Ed!

01:17:46.006 --> 01:17:48.267
- Ed, hello.
- Listen, Ron.

01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:52.137
Corningstone disappeared in the midst
of the biggest story of the year.

01:17:52.181 --> 01:17:54.269
We need you down here
right away.

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:55.965
Wait, Ed.

01:17:55.965 --> 01:17:59.139
Does this mean you're asking me
to report the news again?

01:18:00.879 --> 01:18:02.879
- Yes.
- Ed!

01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:05.010
That's wonderful!
Thank you!

01:18:05.054 --> 01:18:07.403
Ed, hold on.
I want to say a few words.

01:18:07.446 --> 01:18:10.752
- You have always been a good friend!
- Right.

01:18:10.795 --> 01:18:12.882
- Always!
- Right.

01:18:14.883 --> 01:18:17.361
Get down here
as quickly as you can.

01:18:17.405 --> 01:18:19.449
Ed, I'll be down there.

01:18:20.537 --> 01:18:23.189
And I'm going to look good.

01:18:32.888 --> 01:18:36.323
Good evening.
I'm Ron Burgundy.

01:18:36.366 --> 01:18:38.759
Damn!
That dude cleans up good!

01:18:38.759 --> 01:18:42.935
If I'm gonna do this, I'll need
my news team at my side.

01:18:50.675 --> 01:18:52.719
News team!

01:18:52.719 --> 01:18:55.285
Assemble!

01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:05.939
News team, assemble!

01:19:07.854 --> 01:19:09.768
Hey, Ron.

01:19:09.768 --> 01:19:11.420
What's up?

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.942
Oh.

01:19:12.942 --> 01:19:15.203
Hi.
Didn't see you there.

01:19:15.246 --> 01:19:18.596
We've been here literally
the entire time you have.

01:19:18.639 --> 01:19:21.553
I'm a little embarrassed.

01:19:21.597 --> 01:19:23.685
Look.

01:19:23.728 --> 01:19:27.990
I just got the call from Harken.
He wants me back.

01:19:28.033 --> 01:19:30.338
But I can't do this
without my news team.

01:19:30.382 --> 01:19:32.035
I don't know, Ron.

01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:34.774
That was half a lifetime ago.
We're different people now.

01:19:34.818 --> 01:19:36.817
When you left,
the hurt was so deep.

01:19:36.817 --> 01:19:39.383
I don't know if I can
go through that again.

01:19:39.427 --> 01:19:41.428
Think about
what you're asking.

01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:43.428
Man.

01:19:43.428 --> 01:19:45.516
Gentlemen,

01:19:46.472 --> 01:19:48.821
there was a time

01:19:48.821 --> 01:19:51.822
when you called me
your lead anchor.

01:19:54.997 --> 01:19:57.216
Will you follow me again?

01:19:59.172 --> 01:20:01.302
I'm gettin' too old
for this shit.

01:20:01.346 --> 01:20:03.347
To the news van!

01:20:03.347 --> 01:20:06.086
- To the news van!
- Okay!

01:20:15.698 --> 01:20:18.090
Ahh!

01:20:18.133 --> 01:20:20.264
Well, I'll be.
Ron Burgundy.

01:20:20.307 --> 01:20:22.003
He's back!

01:20:22.003 --> 01:20:25.004
Gentlemen, let's try
to get in a good position for the story.

01:20:25.004 --> 01:20:27.005
- How does the hair look?
- Magnificent.

01:20:27.005 --> 01:20:29.136
You have hair like an angel.

01:20:29.178 --> 01:20:32.050
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Network talent scout.

01:20:32.094 --> 01:20:35.530
- This is a hot one.
- I'm actually nervous.

01:20:35.572 --> 01:20:37.659
Let's go get 'em.

01:20:37.703 --> 01:20:39.616
Wait! Did you
just hear something?

01:20:39.616 --> 01:20:42.357
Help.

01:20:42.401 --> 01:20:44.879
- Ron, help!
- Veronica!

01:20:44.879 --> 01:20:47.097
- Are you okay?
- Shh!

01:20:47.097 --> 01:20:48.793
How did you
get down there?

01:20:48.793 --> 01:20:50.880
Just go get someone.
Please.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.229
Hold on.
Hold on!

01:20:56.404 --> 01:20:58.231
We've got to do something.

01:20:58.231 --> 01:21:00.710
Whoa, Ron, I don't want
to sound cruel, but--

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.057
There's a network
talent scout over there.

01:21:03.101 --> 01:21:05.189
This is a tough decision.

01:21:05.233 --> 01:21:07.841
So much to think about.

01:21:07.885 --> 01:21:10.408
Basically the biggest story
of my career,

01:21:10.408 --> 01:21:14.235
launching me to a level
I've never known before,

01:21:14.235 --> 01:21:15.713
or saving the woman

01:21:15.713 --> 01:21:19.063
I used to have
familiar relations with.

01:21:19.063 --> 01:21:21.758
This is hard!

01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:24.411
I am in a pickle!

01:21:24.455 --> 01:21:26.847
Ron, I know
it sounds harsh,

01:21:26.847 --> 01:21:29.369
but God does not
want her to live.

01:21:29.412 --> 01:21:31.499
No. Hold on.

01:21:32.806 --> 01:21:34.893
It's clear now.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.980
We go into the bear pit.

01:21:40.286 --> 01:21:42.373
Ron, don't.

01:21:44.373 --> 01:21:46.460
Oh!

01:21:48.592 --> 01:21:51.549
I immediately
regret this decision.

01:21:51.592 --> 01:21:54.115
What are you doing?
Why didn't you get help?

01:21:54.158 --> 01:21:56.550
These bears are massive!

01:21:56.594 --> 01:21:59.246
They looked
a lot smaller from up there.

01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:02.118
Fan out.
Let's go find Harken.

01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:04.770
Stay calm.

01:22:06.815 --> 01:22:10.162
It's all right. I think it's all right,
my sweet chinchilla.

01:22:10.206 --> 01:22:12.293
- Oh, Ron.
- Yes, yes.

01:22:12.337 --> 01:22:14.469
In case we die here today,

01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:17.382
there's something
that you should know.

01:22:17.424 --> 01:22:20.426
That dirty trick
with the Teleprompter, it wasn't--

01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:23.906
Sweet Eli Whitney's nose!
It wasn't you, was it?

01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:26.341
It was Wes Mantooth.

01:22:26.385 --> 01:22:29.298
- Oh, I should have known.
- No, no.

01:22:29.342 --> 01:22:31.690
- No, I did it.
- You bitch!

01:22:31.734 --> 01:22:34.821
Shh!

01:22:35.996 --> 01:22:38.300
You woke the bears.
Why did you do that?

01:22:41.388 --> 01:22:44.999
There's somebody
in the bear pit!

01:22:47.521 --> 01:22:50.434
It took
my impending death

01:22:50.477 --> 01:22:53.130
for me to realize
how much I need you.

01:22:53.173 --> 01:22:55.478
Oh, Ron.

01:22:58.828 --> 01:23:00.827
Those bears
are gonna hurt them!

01:23:00.827 --> 01:23:03.654
News team, let's hunt.

01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:07.179
News team!

01:23:10.178 --> 01:23:12.265
Bear fight!

01:23:14.527 --> 01:23:17.050
Come on.
Come on!

01:23:23.617 --> 01:23:25.008
Damn!

01:23:25.008 --> 01:23:27.096
Hit 'em in the uvula!

01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:29.357
Hey, Ron!

01:23:29.357 --> 01:23:31.445
I'm riding a furry tractor!

01:23:32.359 --> 01:23:34.794
The bears have descended
on the news team

01:23:34.836 --> 01:23:36.489
and it's not going well.

01:23:36.489 --> 01:23:39.490
Clearly, after today,
I will no longer--

01:23:39.534 --> 01:23:42.187
Come on!
Oh, God!

01:23:42.231 --> 01:23:44.666
It's getting to be
ri-goddamn-diculous!

01:23:46.362 --> 01:23:47.797
Oh, no.

01:23:47.797 --> 01:23:50.885
We woke up the mama.

01:23:53.451 --> 01:23:55.538
Oh, God!

01:23:56.451 --> 01:23:58.887
I don't wanna die.

01:24:04.585 --> 01:24:08.715
Baxter!

01:24:46.988 --> 01:24:49.465
Look! They're following their mother!

01:24:49.465 --> 01:24:50.857
It's instinct.

01:24:50.857 --> 01:24:53.162
Oh, Baxter!

01:24:53.206 --> 01:24:57.598
Oh! Oh, Baxter,
you're still alive!

01:24:57.598 --> 01:25:00.991
Oh, I'm so happy!

01:25:01.034 --> 01:25:04.688
I'm so happy!
You are alive!

01:25:04.731 --> 01:25:07.339
I'm so happy!

01:25:13.690 --> 01:25:15.168
I will lick you!

01:25:15.168 --> 01:25:18.256
I will lick you in front
of everyone to show my joy.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.387
Oh. Ohhh!

01:25:20.387 --> 01:25:23.475
Boy, he really
likes that dog.

01:25:23.519 --> 01:25:25.954
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

01:25:25.998 --> 01:25:28.345
Burgundy! Burgundy!

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.998
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

01:25:31.042 --> 01:25:33.304
Hi, Ron.

01:25:33.347 --> 01:25:36.478
It's always a long fall
from the top, isn't it?

01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:38.001
Easy, Wes.

01:25:38.001 --> 01:25:41.392
I've been waiting
to say this to you for a long time.

01:25:41.435 --> 01:25:43.827
- All right.
- Deep down in my stomach,

01:25:43.827 --> 01:25:45.524
with every inch of me,

01:25:45.524 --> 01:25:48.350
I pure, straight

01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:50.482
hate you!

01:25:55.179 --> 01:25:57.571
But, God damn it,
do I respect you!

01:26:10.618 --> 01:26:12.096
Thank you,

01:26:12.096 --> 01:26:14.184
brother.

01:26:15.793 --> 01:26:19.055
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

01:26:19.055 --> 01:26:21.535
Today we spell redemption

01:26:21.535 --> 01:26:23.578
R-O-N.

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:26.404
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.318
Ron, you're my hero!

01:26:28.318 --> 01:26:32.144
Ron, I think you've got
a story to report.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.319
Are you sure, Ed?

01:26:36.711 --> 01:26:38.624
Do it.

01:26:38.624 --> 01:26:41.233
It's the story
you were born to tell.

01:26:46.279 --> 01:26:48.758
San Diego's waiting.
Go get 'em.

01:26:48.801 --> 01:26:50.410
Make way!

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:53.411
Ron Burgundy's about
to report on pandas!

01:26:55.890 --> 01:26:57.499
Count me down.
Three.

01:26:57.499 --> 01:26:59.586
You're live, Mr. Burgundy.

01:26:59.586 --> 01:27:01.588
This is Ron Burgundy,

01:27:01.588 --> 01:27:05.457
proudly reporting once again
for Channel 4 News.

01:27:05.501 --> 01:27:09.329
Today's story is one
of the more remarkable things

01:27:09.373 --> 01:27:12.459
ever to happen
to San Diago

01:27:12.503 --> 01:27:14.243
or even the world.

01:27:14.243 --> 01:27:17.244
But in order
to properly retell it,

01:27:17.244 --> 01:27:19.592
I'm going to need
some help

01:27:19.636 --> 01:27:21.983
from my co-anchor,

01:27:23.202 --> 01:27:25.245
Miss Veronica Corningstone.

01:27:27.377 --> 01:27:30.074
- High-pressure system--
- No, no, no, no, Brick.

01:27:30.117 --> 01:27:32.204
- High-pressure system--
- Go stand over there.

01:27:36.161 --> 01:27:37.597
Oh, Ron.

01:27:37.597 --> 01:27:39.946
Ron, there are literally
thousands of men

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:41.598
that I should
be with instead,

01:27:41.598 --> 01:27:44.730
but I am 72% sure
that I love you.

01:27:51.949 --> 01:27:55.123
Yes, redemption was
sweet for Ron Burgundy.

01:27:55.167 --> 01:27:57.863
Yes!
Ron!

01:27:57.906 --> 01:28:01.560
- As for the news team:
- Stop it! Ron!

01:28:01.604 --> 01:28:04.995
Champ Kind went on to become
a commentator for the NFL,

01:28:05.039 --> 01:28:07.604
but was later fired
after being accused

01:28:07.648 --> 01:28:11.302
of sexual harassment
by Terry Bradshaw.

01:28:11.345 --> 01:28:13.390
Excuse me.

01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:15.955
Is that Sex Panther
you're wearing?

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:20.782
Brian Fantana went on
to have great success

01:28:20.826 --> 01:28:23.349
as the host of the hit
reality TV show

01:28:23.391 --> 01:28:26.262
"Intercourse Island"
on the Fox Network.

01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:29.002
Anyone seen Brick?

01:28:29.046 --> 01:28:31.090
- Brick?
- Don't! That tickles!

01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:34.307
No, that tickles me!
Come on!

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:37.308
Brick Tamland
is married with 11 children

01:28:37.352 --> 01:28:39.570
and is one of the top
political advisors

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:41.353
to the Bush White House.

01:28:41.353 --> 01:28:44.005
I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

01:28:54.574 --> 01:28:57.748
And Ron and Veronica
didn't stay in San Diego long.

01:29:01.663 --> 01:29:03.794
I chose them
as my replacement,

01:29:03.837 --> 01:29:07.229
and they became the first
mixed-gender network news team,

01:29:07.272 --> 01:29:09.533
and they're still
doing it today.

01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:12.665
From all of us here
at the World News Center,

01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:14.492
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

01:29:14.492 --> 01:29:16.362
And I'm Ron Burgundy.

01:29:16.362 --> 01:29:19.015
You stay classy, planet Earth.

In the back of the head.

01:30:03.636 --> 01:30:06.158
I'm sorry.

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.897
You're not very bright.
You know that, right?

01:30:09.941 --> 01:30:11.638
You're actually
quite a dullard.

01:30:11.638 --> 01:30:14.031
Everyone here knows it.

01:30:14.073 --> 01:30:18.205
If I'm a dullard,
you're the, uh, the dull--

01:30:18.248 --> 01:30:21.423
Oh! Can't think of
anything to say, can you?

01:30:21.466 --> 01:30:24.468
Yes, I can. I can think
of a lot of things to say.

01:30:24.468 --> 01:30:26.554
Like, you're a dirty bitch.

01:30:29.468 --> 01:30:31.773
Well, Ron, I'm gonna
put poison--

01:30:31.816 --> 01:30:33.904
Oh, my God!

01:30:38.383 --> 01:30:41.602
I drank a lava lamp.
It wasn't lava.

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:43.994
I ate a whole bunch
of fiberglass insulation.

01:30:44.037 --> 01:30:48.473
It wasn't cotton candy
like that guy said.

01:30:48.516 --> 01:30:50.127
My stomach's itchy.

01:30:50.127 --> 01:30:51.344
I pooped a hammer.

01:30:51.344 --> 01:30:53.518
I pooped
a tape recorder.

01:30:53.561 --> 01:30:55.649
I pooped
a Cornish game hen.

01:30:58.259 --> 01:31:00.172
Uh...

01:31:00.172 --> 01:31:02.259
Nope.

01:31:03.216 --> 01:31:05.260
You do not take
a tone with me,

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:08.522
'cause I will give you a rap right
on the Jack Johnson!

01:31:08.566 --> 01:31:10.088
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:31:10.088 --> 01:31:11.870
Now this
is happenin'.

01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:13.524
What are
you doing?

01:31:13.524 --> 01:31:15.612
- Hah!
- What are you doing?

01:31:15.655 --> 01:31:17.741
What are you--

01:31:22.004 --> 01:31:23.222
Action.

01:31:23.222 --> 01:31:25.310
We'll go back to doing
what I do best--

01:31:25.353 --> 01:31:28.137
I guess we'll go back to doing
what I do best, show off.

01:31:28.179 --> 01:31:30.136
When do we
get started?

01:31:30.136 --> 01:31:31.876
When do we get started?

01:31:31.876 --> 01:31:33.876
- That's my line.
- When do we get started?

01:31:33.876 --> 01:31:35.877
You say,
"Whenever you like."

01:31:35.877 --> 01:31:37.617
Whenever you like.

01:31:37.617 --> 01:31:39.704
Keep it rollin'.
This is good stuff.

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:43.531
...an area bank
in a daring...

01:31:43.575 --> 01:31:46.794
Probably not the same one.
Probably not the same guy.

01:31:54.535 --> 01:31:56.579
Brick, before I let you go,

01:31:56.579 --> 01:31:59.188
are you still having your celebrity
golf tournament this summer?

01:31:59.188 --> 01:32:01.188
No, too many people
died last year.

01:32:01.232 --> 01:32:03.406
So we're not gonna do--

01:32:03.450 --> 01:32:05.537
Sorry. Sorry.

01:32:06.233 --> 01:32:09.538
They named it
San Diego.

01:32:09.538 --> 01:32:13.322
Which in German means,
"a whale's vagina."

01:32:19.889 --> 01:32:22.412
This is the most
ridiculous thing ever.

01:32:43.503 --> 01:32:47.113

01:32:47.157 --> 01:32:50.940

Way to handle him.
That was nice.

01:33:18.296 --> 01:33:20.165
It sure is good
to be number one.

01:33:20.165 --> 01:33:22.819
It sure beats the hell
out of number two.

01:33:24.253 --> 01:33:26.646
We are laughing!

01:33:26.646 --> 01:33:28.993
And we are
very good friends.

01:33:29.037 --> 01:33:31.995
Good buddies sharing
a special moment.

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:34.865
Don't say anything, Ron.
Just let it happen.

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:37.953
We're laughing,
enjoying our friendship.

01:33:37.953 --> 01:33:41.432
And someday we'll look back
on this with much fondness.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.651
Yeah.
