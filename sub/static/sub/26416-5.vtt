you say you want to form

It's definitely her.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.390
That means she's still
in the library.

Can't say. People. Zombies.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.490
More bombs. Who knows what else.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.840
Okay. You and Cara
set up a triage outside.

02:24.883 --> 02:25.928
Got it.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.190
We'll go in
and search for survivors.

They could be anywhere.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.080
No. We need to think
strategically.

13:40.471 --> 13:41.821

13:41.864 --> 13:42.517
Yeah.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.305

at Northern Light,

13:50.090 --> 13:52.309
that was like an out of the way
closet, right?

13:52.353 --> 13:53.267
Was it?

13:53.615 --> 13:54.703
That's where she would go.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.096
So you think that

13:56.139 --> 13:57.837
Nana knows the closet layout
of the Pacifica library?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.882

stash.

19:06.362 --> 19:09.452
If I shoot it,
probably will blow up.

19:09.496 --> 19:12.716
Pike it, might fall on the timer
and trigger it.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.465
Oh, shit.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.099
They killed all the books.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.675
People are dead.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.939
People who were just...

20:03.593 --> 20:09.120
living their lives in what was
supposed to be a safe place.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.385
New...

20:17.955 --> 20:19.566
And now everybody is scattered

20:19.609 --> 20:22.308
because we just
can't trust Talkers anymore.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.309
You know that's not true.

20:23.352 --> 20:26.050
Doesn't matter what's true.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.184
It matters what people believe.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.414
Listen.

20:44.417 --> 20:48.682
We cannot stop fighting
for what we believe in.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.745
We save who we can.

21:09.137 --> 21:12.009
And we find out who did this.

21:12.836 --> 21:16.100
And we get your damn country

Just come with us now, okay?

27:13.022 --> 27:14.110
She's turning!

27:14.154 --> 27:16.199
Help me hold her!

27:18.201 --> 27:19.899
What do I do

27:19.942 --> 27:22.510
I'm out of bizkits.
Hold her down.

27:44.445 --> 27:47.230
Mercy her! Someone!
Before she bites us all!

27:47.274 --> 27:48.623
She just needs a bizkit!

27:48.667 --> 27:50.233
We don't have any bizkits!

27:50.973 --> 27:52.192
Mercy her!

27:52.235 --> 27:53.497
Move!

28:01.070 --> 28:03.464
If we would have quarantined
the Talkers,

28:03.507 --> 28:04.857
none of this
would have happened!

28:04.900 --> 28:05.945
It's not safe here!

28:05.988 --> 28:07.468
It's a Talker uprising!

28:07.511 --> 28:08.861
Only I don't see

28:08.904 --> 28:12.734
any of our Talkers out there
among the bombers, do you?

28:12.995 --> 28:15.868
Where have you been this whole
time while we were under attack?

28:17.086 --> 28:18.305
Acutally,

28:18.827 --> 28:20.611
I was busy dying.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.534
And what about the Talkers
who fled?

28:30.578 --> 28:32.406
You all plotted this together,
didn't you?

28:32.449 --> 28:36.279
All I see are zombies out there
and the humans that they turned.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.151
Zombies. That's who
attacked you. Not Talkers.

28:38.194 --> 28:39.587
But who sent the zombies?

28:39.630 --> 28:42.285
I bet your friend Dante knows.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.723
He might.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.813
He might also be dead.

28:48.814 --> 28:52.208
I know a lot of you think
our dream here is over.

28:52.469 --> 28:54.863
Talkers and humans
can't live together.

28:54.907 --> 28:57.648
I'm not giving up on Newmerica.

28:58.432 --> 28:59.999
Not yet.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.478
You're gonna get us all killed!

29:01.522 --> 29:03.437
Talkers are not humans!

29:03.480 --> 29:05.482
I just don't feel safe here
anymore!

29:05.526 --> 29:07.006
They're scared.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.659
And they should be.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.620
We got to find Dante.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.970
We need to find
who's doing this.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.190
Indeed.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.107
It's Altura. They came.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.283
Hey! Over here! Hi!

29:29.158 --> 29:31.770
Altura.
Must've heard Kaya's SOS.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.338
They're here
to take people away.

29:35.382 --> 29:37.340
Yeah, well that's a good thing,
right? They're here to help.

29:37.384 --> 29:41.431
Thank you so much for coming!
Thank you. Thank you.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.913
No. Not all the people.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.607
Uh-uh, uh-uh. No wounded.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.305
What do you mean no wounded?

31:12.348 --> 31:14.263
We have a right to safety
just like anyone else.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.700
Those are our orders.
Humans only.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.098
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.840
I said humans only.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.973
No, man, I'm not a Talker.

31:28.016 --> 31:28.974
Hey, no, wait. No! No!

31:31.454 --> 31:32.803
You shot me!

31:32.847 --> 31:34.980
And yet you're still talking.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.460
Sorry, but you stay.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.986
There are no bizkits here.
We're gonna...

31:41.029 --> 31:42.988
What, what, what

31:43.553 --> 31:46.817
That's exactly why
you can't come with us.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.737
No, no, no. No books.

31:57.393 --> 31:59.395
It's okay. It's okay.
You go.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.267
These will be here
when you get back.

32:01.310 --> 32:04.226
If any living humans
want to seek refuge in Altura,

32:04.270 --> 32:06.315
we leave in five minutes.

32:06.359 --> 32:07.447
Five minutes?

32:07.490 --> 32:09.840
But the books... Archives...

32:09.884 --> 32:11.320
That's not enough time
to save everything.

32:11.364 --> 32:14.584
We're not here to save books.
We're here to save humans.

32:14.628 --> 32:18.545
If you're going, you need to
leave now before it gets dark.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.811
We can't keep you safe here
after that.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.552
Listen here, bro.

32:25.856 --> 32:29.860
Why don't you give them one hour
and let them save what they can?

32:31.906 --> 32:33.429
Let's go.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.695
Three minutes!

32:40.871 --> 32:41.611
Hey.

32:43.178 --> 32:45.224
We're sending Nana and JZ to
Altura. They'll be safer there.

32:45.267 --> 32:48.140
We're not giving up.
We're staying.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.926
You're right. They'll be
safer there. You should go too.

32:52.361 --> 32:53.449
What?

32:53.493 --> 32:55.538
Look, the first attacks
happened there.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.410
We want to know
who's behind this.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.065
I think someone needs to be
on the inside.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.370
Good thinking.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.985
All right, boss. We can do that.

33:08.160 --> 33:12.251
Deuces. Hey buddy,
we're going on a trip.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.658
Anyone else going?

33:29.181 --> 33:31.009
Any humans?

33:31.400 --> 33:32.358
No?

33:34.316 --> 33:36.057
Suit yourself.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.444
Let's get this overwith.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.824
So much destruction.

36:15.303 --> 36:20.787
And now everyone, humans,
are scattered in the wind.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.877
I really don't want to
leave it like this.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.577
Stronger together, right?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.797
Isn't that what you say?

36:30.840 --> 36:32.451
I did.

36:32.494 --> 36:36.629
That was just an idea, really.
A hope.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.458
Maybe that's not enough anymore.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.763
Come on.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.026
Hope is...

36:43.331 --> 36:45.812
Sometimes that's all we got.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.857
And sometimes...

36:48.336 --> 36:51.557
Hope is all you need.

36:52.906 --> 36:56.344
Yeah, I think you were
nicknamed George for a reason.

36:56.388 --> 37:01.697
You know, sometimes a great idea
is worth more than you think.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.309
Here. That'll keep you going.

37:06.528 --> 37:07.573
Thank you.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.320
Okay.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.236
I'm ready to go now.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.339
What do we have here?

39:01.817 --> 39:05.952
Looks like Homer, yes.

39:05.995 --> 39:10.652
Greek Mythology.
That'd be over by Yolanda.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.134
Here's three more.

39:25.667 --> 39:29.323
Guess we all go green
eventually, right?

39:38.898 --> 39:41.117
All right.
Give them black leaves.

39:41.161 --> 39:44.382
At least now
they won't be forgotten.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.105
Would've been nice of Dante
to leave me a message.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.107
Hey, maybe he did.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.416
We're definitely
on the right track.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.333
That's a trail marker.

40:23.551 --> 40:26.336
Safe passage for the Talkers?

40:26.380 --> 40:27.990
Hopefully.

40:28.034 --> 40:29.644
We better get there first.

40:29.688 --> 40:30.428
Indeed.
