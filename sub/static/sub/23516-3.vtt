[Don Dahler] <i>You see how greedy </i>

00:39.539 --> 00:41.332
Yeah, I could see how it looks greedy,

00:41.416 --> 00:43.835
but I think there's a lot of
altruistic properties to it.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.047
[reporter 1] <i>Martin Shkreli </i>

It's not funny, Mr. Shkreli.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.780

01:17.660 --> 01:19.954
<i>arrested today for securities fraud.</i>

01:23.666 --> 01:26.461
I was sitting with an investor
who was complaining to me

01:26.544 --> 01:30.006
about how awful and unethical
Martin Shkreli's actions were

01:30.089 --> 01:32.217
in hiking up the price of Daraprim.

01:32.300 --> 01:36.054
I said to him, "Why is what Valeant's
doing any different?"

01:36.137 --> 01:38.807
And he said,
"Well, that's a good question."

01:40.850 --> 01:43.269
<i>If Martin was the minnow in all of this...</i>

01:44.437 --> 01:47.690

[Fahmi Quadir]
<i>I was always this Pollyanna growing up</i>

03:30.126 --> 03:33.630
<i>and thought science and drugs</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:36.716
<i>But that was kind of </i>
<i>idealistic and unrealistic. </i>

03:38.092 --> 03:41.137
<i>These are capitalist businesses.</i>

03:41.221 --> 03:43.765
<i>They're trying to make profits</i>
<i>for their shareholders </i>

03:43.848 --> 03:47.644

<i>I wouldn't necessarily agree with.</i>

03:52.982 --> 03:54.901
<i>Short sellers tend to get a bad rap</i>

03:54.984 --> 03:58.863
<i>because we say a lot of things</i>

03:59.906 --> 04:01.991
<i>There are a lot of people</i>

04:02.075 --> 04:04.452
<i>Valeant management</i>
<i>certainly does not like me. </i>

04:04.535 --> 04:07.580
<i>But that doesn't stop me, </i>

04:07.664 --> 04:09.540
<i>because I'm driven by doing good</i>

04:09.624 --> 04:12.877

<i>by companies like Valeant.</i>

04:15.880 --> 04:17.882
<i>What I do is not about making money.</i>

04:18.508 --> 04:23.471
Your interest has to be in bringing
some of these companies to justice.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.083
[Erin Lee Carr] <i>Can you talk about</i>
<i>the rise of the company?</i>

04:52.166 --> 04:53.543
Sure, I can do this really well,

04:53.626 --> 04:55.878
because I have been fighting the company
for decades.

04:56.462 --> 05:02.885
Uh, Valeant's forbearer or its origin
was a company called Biovail,

05:02.969 --> 05:06.014
which is a corporate clogged toilet
based in Canada.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.598
We've got a merger in medicine...

05:07.682 --> 05:11.602
[Boyd] <i>In 2010, there was a sort of </i>
<i>a merger of equals</i>

05:11.686 --> 05:13.229
with Valeant Pharmaceutical.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.357
Valeant planted a foreign flag
to save money

05:16.441 --> 05:18.484
as a way to skip paying taxes stateside.

05:18.568 --> 05:23.197
[Boyd] <i>And a guy named Mike Pearson</i>
<i>took over the remaining company.</i>

05:23.698 --> 05:25.575
Our job is to create shareholder value.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.953
And, uh,
so people shouldn't be afraid of...

05:29.037 --> 05:33.041
of anything that happens
that helps them create shareholder value.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.417
<i>That's our job.</i>

05:37.795 --> 05:39.839
[Bethany McLean] <i>When Mike Pearson </i>
<i>stepped in to run Valeant, </i>

05:39.922 --> 05:42.633
<i>its stock was maybe less than $15 a share.</i>

05:42.717 --> 05:47.263
But at its peak, it hit $262 a share.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.725
It was an incredible, incredible ride.

05:50.808 --> 05:55.063
One of the greatest money-making, uh,
opportunities Wall Street has ever seen.

05:55.146 --> 05:58.858
Valeant Pharmaceuticals
is continuing its shopping spree,

05:58.941 --> 06:01.611
announcing that it's to buy
orphan drug maker Aton Pharma.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.530
Billion-dollar takeover deal
in the pharmaceutical industry.

06:04.614 --> 06:09.410
Canada's Valeant is buying Medicis
Pharmaceutical for $2.6 billion in cash.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.162
That is about $44 a share.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.246
<i>Over to you, Seema.</i>

06:12.330 --> 06:16.501
Maria, Valeant Pharmaceuticals acquiring
Bausch and Lomb for $8.7 billion.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.127
That was a big move
in the health-care scene.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.588
Our strategy is a pretty simple one.

06:20.671 --> 06:25.927
Uh, since I joined the company three plus
years ago, we've made 22 acquisitions.

06:26.010 --> 06:29.013
We'd like to do this still, but if not,
we'll do something else.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.850
[cheers and applause]

06:36.729 --> 06:41.692
[Boyd] <i>Valeant Pharmaceuticals is just</i>
<i>simply hoovering up companies. </i>

06:41.776 --> 06:46.572
They're like a vacuum sucking up companies
out of the public markets.

06:46.656 --> 06:50.368
At one point, I'd tracked
that they had bought 110 companies.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.584
For a while, the entire pharmaceutical
industry was terrorized by

06:58.668 --> 07:00.586
and terrified of Valeant,

07:00.670 --> 07:05.299
because they were the company that was
getting all of Wall Street's admiration.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.803
This was the hot stock and supposedly
these guys were the ones

07:08.886 --> 07:12.598
who had figured out how the pharmaceutical
industry was supposed to work.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.767
[woman] <i>Valeant, Valeant,</i>
<i>Valeant, Valeant.</i>

07:30.575 --> 07:32.118
On Wall Street,
there's smart and dumb money.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.414
<i>The smart money</i>
<i>are the premier hedge funds,</i>

07:36.914 --> 07:38.833
<i>some of the best investors of our time.</i>

07:39.667 --> 07:44.213
<i>From the Sequoia Fund, which was run</i>
<i>by a protégé of Warren Buffett's, </i>

07:44.297 --> 07:46.757
<i>to Bill Ackman,</i>
<i>whose hedge fund Pershing Square </i>

07:46.841 --> 07:50.678
<i>was one of the biggest, most successful</i>
<i>hedge funds out there, </i>

07:50.761 --> 07:51.762
<i>to ValueAct. </i>

07:51.846 --> 07:56.809
<i>This fund that is always below the radar,</i>
<i>but is regarded as being very smart.</i>

07:57.310 --> 07:59.145
All of these guys were in Valeant.

08:00.021 --> 08:04.525
We originated
with Mike this strategy of rolling up,

08:04.609 --> 08:07.236
to use your words, consolidating
the pharmaceutical industry.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.448
And Mike has proven
that the execution is there.

08:13.951 --> 08:17.955
[McLean] <i>They saw a CEO who promised</i>
<i>a revolutionary strategy</i>

08:18.039 --> 08:22.502
<i>that was smarter than what everybody else</i>
<i>in the pharmaceutical industry was doing.</i>

08:22.960 --> 08:25.546
<i>It was music to the ears of people</i>
<i>on Wall Street,</i>

08:25.630 --> 08:28.466
who tend to think they're smarter
than everybody else.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.636
So, if somebody markets themselves
as smarter than everybody else,

08:31.719 --> 08:34.096
wow, it's like meets like.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.700
[Boyd] <i>I think, to look at Valeant,</i>
<i>you had to be an outsider.</i>

08:55.159 --> 08:57.703
<i>If you're in the Wall Street machine,</i>

08:57.787 --> 09:00.873
<i>you just wanted their share price</i>
<i>to go up and up and up.</i>

09:02.250 --> 09:05.878
<i>But on the other hand was </i>
<i>this small minority of dissenters</i>

09:05.962 --> 09:07.171
<i>called short sellers.</i>

09:07.255 --> 09:11.175
Two thirds of the broader
global financial community

09:11.259 --> 09:13.511
views them as...

09:13.594 --> 09:16.931
loosely affiliated with,
let's say, ISIS/Al-Qaeda.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.437
<i>For example, there is this colorful guy</i>
<i>out in Beverly Hills, </i>

09:23.521 --> 09:25.314
<i>guy named Andrew Left.</i>

09:26.691 --> 09:29.694
[Carr] In simplest terms,
what is short selling?

09:30.361 --> 09:31.404
Oh, boy.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.907
It's amazing 'cause every day
the stock market opens.

09:36.909 --> 09:41.497
<i>So every day, any stock has </i>
<i>an equal chance of going up or down.</i>

09:42.206 --> 09:45.084
But everybody only thinks
stocks can go up.

09:45.918 --> 09:50.172
<i>If 90% of America is looking at</i>
<i>what stock's gonna go up the next day, </i>

09:50.256 --> 09:52.592
<i>what if I just flip that thought and say,</i>

09:52.675 --> 09:55.886
<i>"Why don't I try to make a living,"</i>
<i>a tough one at that,</i>

09:55.970 --> 09:58.598
<i>"saying what stocks </i>
<i>are gonna go down tomorrow?"</i>

10:03.561 --> 10:06.814
[Boyd] <i>There are a lot of very,</i>
<i>very smart people on Wall Street,</i>

10:08.107 --> 10:13.112
<i>but Fahmi Quadir, she is just </i>
<i>a next-level intelligent person.</i>

10:14.447 --> 10:18.909
To use the chess analogy, she saw
three to four moves ahead on Valeant.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.371
[Quadir] <i>No company is telling you</i>

10:22.455 --> 10:24.206
<i>why you should short their stock.</i>

10:24.707 --> 10:28.961
Every source of information,
everything that the company tells you,

10:29.045 --> 10:34.425
everything you hear on CNBC is largely
people telling you to buy a stock.

10:34.925 --> 10:39.347
So to go short, you need to go out there
and find the information on your own.

10:39.847 --> 10:44.477
Oh, I forgot one other.
Uh, John Hempton in Australia.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.982
[John Hempton] <i>We like to find people</i>
<i>who are cheating other people.</i>

10:50.066 --> 10:50.941
[Carr] Why?

10:51.025 --> 10:55.780
Because sometimes they give you
trading opportunities that are oblique.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.282
For instance,
this highly reputable-looking

10:58.366 --> 11:00.284
pharmaceutical company called Valeant,

11:00.368 --> 11:03.079
was in reality a house of cards,

11:03.162 --> 11:05.665
with people cheating other people
left, right and center.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.544
<i>We figured that, at some stage,</i>
<i>all of this cheating would come undone, </i>

11:10.628 --> 11:13.297
<i>and the Valeant stock would go down</i>
<i>a long, long way.</i>

11:15.174 --> 11:16.884
We follow bad people in markets,

11:16.967 --> 11:20.262
we're very good at picking apart
bad accounts,

11:20.346 --> 11:21.555
and we short-sell them.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.517
And that means we make a profit
when stocks go down.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.605
Fahmi, Andrew Left, maybe Hempton,

11:29.688 --> 11:32.525
maybe seven people in the world
are questioning,

11:32.608 --> 11:34.318
"This emperor has no clothes."

11:35.361 --> 11:38.614
If you haven't noticed about us,
we're mostly outsiders. [chuckles]

11:38.697 --> 11:42.618
We didn't need to believe the bullshit.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.501
<i>Fahmi and I chatted maybe 20 times, </i>

11:50.584 --> 11:52.837
<i>and of all the people I spoke to,</i>

11:52.920 --> 11:56.298
<i>she was the person</i>
<i>that had the most original observations.</i>

11:59.301 --> 12:03.013
[Quadir] <i>I never, in my life, thought</i>
<i>I would be a short seller.</i>

12:03.097 --> 12:05.766
I was just planning to take a gap year

12:05.850 --> 12:09.061
and then start my PhD
in algebraic topology.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.355
Um, but that never happened.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.817
<i>I got pulled into Big Pharma consulting.</i>

12:16.068 --> 12:19.321
<i>And then a famous short seller</i>
<i>saw the way I thought</i>

12:19.405 --> 12:23.367
<i>and the kinds of lengths I would go</i>
<i>to conduct my research.</i>

12:23.868 --> 12:27.163
He saw that I was a short seller
before I even knew it.

12:28.998 --> 12:33.169
The thing is, with Valeant, no one wanted
to hear the short side of the story.

12:33.252 --> 12:37.631
It was all about the magical numbers
that Valeant was putting out.

12:37.715 --> 12:43.137
These non-GAAP adjusted, EBITDA metrics,
pro forma cash, EPS, et cetera.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.306
And that's all investors
wanted to hear about.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.837
Valeant Pharmaceuticals' main source
of growth isn't new drugs.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.798
It's been growing revenue by buying out
smaller companies.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.551
Mike, it's all about acquisitions, why?

13:22.635 --> 13:26.180
We've looked at the return on
research and development in total.

13:26.263 --> 13:30.434
Um, for the last decade or so,
it has not been positive for the industry.

13:30.518 --> 13:34.563
And, um, so we think a much better use
of our capital

13:34.647 --> 13:36.815
is to, uh, buy products that are approved,

13:36.899 --> 13:40.486
buy companies that have approved products,
and grow that way.

13:40.569 --> 13:44.698
Pearson was a real skeptic of the money
that most pharmaceutical companies spend

13:44.782 --> 13:45.866
developing new drugs.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.995
<i>He thought that most of those dollars</i>
<i>were wasted. They weren't efficient.</i>

13:50.079 --> 13:52.706
<i>There were better ways to run</i>
<i>a pharmaceutical company </i>

13:52.790 --> 13:56.710
<i>much more efficiently in order to make </i>
<i>more money for its shareholders.</i>

13:57.920 --> 14:01.674
You might go for three or four years
running a pharmaceutical company

14:01.757 --> 14:03.008
and not have any breakthroughs.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.470
And if you're someone who's
a McKinsey analyst or a hedge funder,

14:06.554 --> 14:08.847
you might say, "Waste of money,"
and throw your hands up.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.684
<i>But if you're a scientist,</i>
<i>you understand it's just time.</i>

14:11.767 --> 14:15.312
<i>It's time, data and understanding,</i>
<i>and you're gonna find it. </i>

14:15.396 --> 14:17.314
<i>If you slash</i>
<i>that research and development, </i>

14:17.398 --> 14:20.109
<i>that all goes to the bottom line.</i>
<i>It's all profitability.</i>

14:21.318 --> 14:23.904
[Hempton] <i>They bought over 100 companies. </i>

14:23.988 --> 14:26.657
<i>Their formula was relatively simple. </i>

14:26.740 --> 14:30.369
"We will consolidate the accounting,
we will consolidate the sales force,

14:30.452 --> 14:32.037
and we won't do science."

14:32.663 --> 14:34.540
<i>And the formula seemed to work.</i>

14:35.624 --> 14:39.461
<i>People had literally made </i>
<i>billions of dollars by backing Mike.</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:42.882
They wanted to tell Wall Street that,

14:42.965 --> 14:45.092
"All this money we make,
that belongs to you."

14:45.175 --> 14:49.013
But this was a company
that pretended to be cheap,

14:49.763 --> 14:53.183
but owned the most expensive
corporate jets you could find.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.189
<i>They went and bought a Gulfstream 650.</i>

15:00.274 --> 15:04.278
This is a corporate jet that can fly
nonstop from New York to China.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.698
[Carr] Valeant had a 650.
What does that say to you?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.075
They like to fly in style.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.869
It's the biggest...

15:13.120 --> 15:16.916
I don't even wanna say "the biggest
swinging dick you can have,"

15:16.999 --> 15:18.417
but that's essentially what it is.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.299
[Quadir] <i>Mike Pearson had this reputation</i>
<i>of spending most of his time </i>

15:25.382 --> 15:30.220
<i>just talking to investors,</i>
<i>taking them on his Gulfstream 650, </i>

15:30.304 --> 15:32.890
<i>flying them out</i>
<i>to Duke basketball games.</i>

15:33.891 --> 15:36.852
What you would hear on the street is,
you know,

15:36.936 --> 15:40.230
"Oh, don't worry about the balance sheet,
don't worry about the fundamentals.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.607
Just talk to Mike."

15:43.317 --> 15:46.904
<i>People thought </i>
<i>that Pearson was infallible.</i>

15:48.280 --> 15:51.408
<i>They failed to do basic research</i>
<i>on what is Valeant.</i>

15:53.535 --> 15:57.498
<i>But with short bets, it's always wise</i>
<i>to do your research first.</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:04.296
I started by looking at the entire history
of Valeant's prescription products.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.926
<i>What Valeant was doing</i>
<i>after it acquired these businesses</i>

16:09.009 --> 16:14.306
<i>was increasing the prices exponentially </i>
<i>and then the sales volumes, </i>

16:14.390 --> 16:17.559
<i>so the patients taking the drug</i>
<i>would substantially decline,</i>

16:17.643 --> 16:21.355
but the dollars that Valeant's generating
are going up.

16:23.816 --> 16:29.530
So, this is my nighttime reading material

16:29.613 --> 16:31.198
for the past two years.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.910
Some people like to read
Buffett biographies,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.413
some like to read <i>Fifty Shades of Grey,</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:40.040
but I spent the last two years of my life

16:40.124 --> 16:44.003
reading every single publicly available
document on Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

16:44.962 --> 16:50.384
<i>This is Valeant's investor day</i>
<i>at the end of 2012. </i>

16:50.467 --> 16:53.554
<i>They were really ramping up</i>
<i>with their acquisitions</i>

16:53.637 --> 16:55.973
<i>and maximizing their value</i>
<i>on those products</i>

16:56.056 --> 17:01.353
<i>through co-pay assistance, </i>
<i>patient assistance and increasing price.</i>

17:06.734 --> 17:10.821
Health care is just a certain field where,
if you're committing fraud,

17:10.904 --> 17:13.323
you're not just committing fraud
against your shareholders,

17:13.407 --> 17:15.325
you're potentially committing fraud
against patients.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.758
[Carr] <i>When did you and your wife meet?</i>

17:30.841 --> 17:33.719
[John] <i>In the late '80s, in Chicago, </i>
<i>through work.</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:38.015
[Carr] <i>What was it like when she told you</i>
<i>she had Wilson's disease?</i>

17:38.098 --> 17:39.349
What did you think at the time?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.602
I didn't think anything about it.

17:41.685 --> 17:46.899
She was taking a simple drug
four times a day and she was fine.

17:47.816 --> 17:52.321
[woman] <i>Wilson's disease is simply</i>
<i>the inability to process copper.</i>

17:52.821 --> 17:57.034
It builds up and, ultimately,
it poisons you through your liver.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.453
About one in 30,000 people have it.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.750
[woman] <i>The medication I take for Wilson's</i>
<i>is Syprine.</i>

18:06.418 --> 18:10.047
[Carr] Can you talk to us about why
it's important for you to be anonymous?

18:12.633 --> 18:14.760
[coughs] Um...

18:18.180 --> 18:21.725
[John] <i>We had spent maybe $30 a month</i>

18:21.809 --> 18:24.186
<i>and that would come out of</i>
<i>our flexible savings.</i>

18:24.269 --> 18:27.523
You just paid it, took the drug
and you went on.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.484
And then all of a sudden,
right after Christmas,

18:30.567 --> 18:31.860
<i>she goes to Walgreens, </i>

18:33.070 --> 18:37.908
and, uh, she calls me and says
they want $20,000

18:39.076 --> 18:40.744
for her drug.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.996
[woman] "This can't be my drug.
This can't be happening.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.623
I've been on this medication for years."

18:44.706 --> 18:46.458
It just kept going up and up and up.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.837
Today, it's $200-plus per tablet.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.048
[Carr] What's the math on that,
$200 per tablet?

18:53.132 --> 18:57.344
It's about, uh, $289,000 a year.

18:59.346 --> 19:04.059
<i>We probably have about $80,000 worth of it</i>
<i>in our refrigerator today.</i>

19:05.686 --> 19:09.064
[Carr] What would happen
if you stop taking the medication?

19:11.150 --> 19:11.984
[woman] I'd die.

19:13.068 --> 19:16.029
And you're insulated from the cost,
until you're not.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.739
Until you lose your job.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.992
Until you find
that you can't get health insurance

19:20.075 --> 19:22.744
because the cost of your medicine
is so exorbitant.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.831
Until it wipes out your family
because you have to pay for it,

19:25.914 --> 19:27.791
because you're gonna die if you don't.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.966
<i>She worries that if her company knew</i>
<i>that her insurance was so costly,</i>

19:36.049 --> 19:38.177
<i>that she would be targeted for layoff.</i>

19:38.677 --> 19:40.179
<i>And if she gets laid off,</i>

19:40.262 --> 19:42.139
<i>she's gonna have a hard time</i>
<i>finding another job,</i>

19:42.222 --> 19:45.142
<i>given her age and healthcare issues.</i>

19:46.101 --> 19:49.146
<i>And if she has to pay</i>
<i>for her medicine herself,</i>

19:49.229 --> 19:51.231
they'll be bankrupt, within a few years.

19:51.940 --> 19:55.861
[woman] I decided I didn't wanna show
my face as I work through all of that.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.823
Everybody runs scared
from these drug companies.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.201
Because the drug companies

20:02.284 --> 20:07.206
have somehow convinced patients
and the advocacy groups,

20:07.289 --> 20:10.709
"If you don't let us have our way,
we'll just not make the drug."

20:13.795 --> 20:19.092
[woman] <i>It's really personal and to see </i>
<i>such greed and avarice go unchecked,</i>

20:19.927 --> 20:21.845
<i>I think was maddening to him.</i>

20:21.929 --> 20:25.641
<i>And if you know John,</i>
<i>he can't stand by and watch it.</i>

20:28.101 --> 20:31.772
[John] <i>You start to try and figure out</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

20:33.065 --> 20:36.026
<i>For 20 years, Merck sold it</i>
<i>for about a dollar a tablet.</i>

20:36.652 --> 20:41.490
<i>In about 2007, we noticed</i>
<i>that the price of the drug had doubled. </i>

20:41.573 --> 20:45.118
<i>Merck put it into a company called Aton.</i>

20:45.202 --> 20:48.538
<i>Three years later, Valeant acquired Aton.</i>

20:48.622 --> 20:52.834
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the price really started to accelerate.</i>

20:55.754 --> 21:00.008
<i>Syprine had risen</i>
<i>to be one of their top 30 drugs.</i>

21:00.092 --> 21:03.262
Well, to be a top 30 drug,
it kinda had to have some volume,

21:03.679 --> 21:06.974
and we knew that this didn't have volume.
So it was all price.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.978
[McLean] <i>If you're willing</i>
<i>to take the price of a drug</i>

21:11.061 --> 21:12.771
<i>that was selling for a dollar a pill</i>

21:12.854 --> 21:15.023
<i>and boost it to $300,000 a year,</i>

21:15.399 --> 21:18.110
if you've figured out that lever
and you're willing to use it...

21:18.193 --> 21:20.112
Well, you've got a gusher.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.949
I mean, you really have found the ability
to turn straw into gold.

21:45.595 --> 21:47.931
[Quadir] <i>Those in finance, </i>
<i>those on Wall Street,</i>

21:48.015 --> 21:50.892
you know, the talking heads
that came on CNBC,

21:50.976 --> 21:55.647
they loved Valeant because it functioned
as if it was a hedge fund.

21:56.732 --> 21:57.733
Bill Ackman is here,

21:57.816 --> 22:00.444
he is the CEO and founder
of Pershing Square Capital Management.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.405
It currently has nearly
$6 billion under management.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.157
You were a very good short seller.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.284
Uh, occasionally, we got it right.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.245
-You were a very good short seller.
-Occ---

22:10.329 --> 22:12.331
Not always. It's a difficult business.

22:12.414 --> 22:17.127
Bill Ackman is a smart, savvy businessman.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.296
I think he's opportunistic,

22:19.379 --> 22:23.342
and I mean that not in a negative way,
but in a positive way.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.677
This is a time of opportunity
for people with money.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.762
Absolutely.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.766
It's the single best time in my career
to invest.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.225
-To invest money?
-Yes.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.771
[Katz] <i>I think Bill is impressed</i>
<i>with Valeant's results,</i>

22:35.854 --> 22:38.732
<i>and I think Mike Pearson</i>
<i>was an impressive guy</i>

22:38.815 --> 22:41.026
<i>from a financial perspective.</i>

22:41.109 --> 22:42.277
I think Bill Ackman

22:42.360 --> 22:45.947
was in the business
of investing money to make money.

22:52.537 --> 22:58.502
Mike Pearson's goal was to be a top five
pharmaceutical company by 2016.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.504
And the only way they could really do that

23:00.587 --> 23:02.464
was to buy something
even bigger than Valeant.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.551
<i>Allergan was an obvious choice.</i>

23:07.969 --> 23:10.305
[McLean] <i>Allergan is, in a way,</i>
<i>the anti-Valeant.</i>

23:10.388 --> 23:12.849
<i>It's an incredibly successful company,</i>

23:12.933 --> 23:15.310
<i>mainly that specialized</i>
<i>in cosmetic products.</i>

23:15.393 --> 23:18.271
Any woman who's used Botox
would know what Allergan is

23:18.355 --> 23:20.440
because Allergan
was the inventor of Botox.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.567
Whatever you think of Botox,
it was an invention

23:22.651 --> 23:24.778
and an incredibly successful one at that.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.363
I'm not the Dalai Lama.

23:26.446 --> 23:29.116
Somebody says, "Oh, Dolly,
you always just look so happy."

23:29.199 --> 23:32.661
-I say, "That's the Botox." So...
-[audience laughing]

23:32.744 --> 23:35.372
Everything was going along just fine.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.500
And here came a company, uh,

23:38.583 --> 23:42.295
really hell-bent
on short-term profit and greed.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.672
Enter Valeant.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.257
[applause]

23:45.340 --> 23:47.509
[announcer] Please welcome
J. Michael Pearson,

23:47.592 --> 23:49.928
chairman and CEO of Valeant.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.097
It did feel a little like Pearl Harbor.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.100
An explosion of M&amp;A action in pharma.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.186
That is our big story.
We've got every angle covered for you.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.688
Top-gun activist Bill Ackman

23:59.771 --> 24:02.357
teams up with Valeant,
Canadian drug company,

24:02.440 --> 24:04.860
to bid for the Botox maker Allergan.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.362
We call it Pharmapalooza.
What does it mean for you?

24:07.445 --> 24:09.239
This, folks, is <i>Power Lunch,</i>

24:09.322 --> 24:11.992
and this, Sue,
is your <i>Power Lunch</i> on drugs.

24:13.618 --> 24:16.329
Uh, so, why does this make sense?

24:16.413 --> 24:18.039
[McLean] <i>Valeant didn't have the money</i>
<i>to buy Allergan.</i>

24:18.123 --> 24:19.958
So just briefly on Pershing Square...

24:20.041 --> 24:21.835
[McLean] <i>And so they teamed up</i>
<i>with Bill Ackman,</i>

24:21.918 --> 24:25.088
who quietly
accumulated the stake in Allergan.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.299
And then tried to, basically,

24:27.382 --> 24:30.468
sway the rest of Allergan shareholders
to go with Valeant.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.889
The outsider. That will be the theme...

24:34.389 --> 24:37.642
[McLean] <i>Bill, who's suave and tall,</i>
<i>perfectly dressed,</i>

24:37.726 --> 24:40.187
<i>with this shock of white hair,</i>
<i>and very healthy,</i>

24:40.270 --> 24:43.690
<i>and then Mike, who's sort of gruff</i>
<i>and a little overweight</i>

24:43.773 --> 24:46.401
<i>and kind of slovenly,</i>
<i>do this presentation.</i>

24:46.484 --> 24:50.447
In terms of historically,
we've grown our business about 55% a year.

24:50.530 --> 24:54.242
Uh, they've grown their businesses
in the emerging markets, about 11% a year.

24:54.326 --> 25:00.832
Both Bill Ackman and Mike Pearson
were masters in use of fact,

25:00.916 --> 25:06.713
to lead to, in my humble view,
erroneous and misleading conclusions.

25:06.796 --> 25:10.133
In the R&amp;D number,
you'll see 1.3 minus 900...

25:10.217 --> 25:16.139
That, uh, Allergan's R&amp;D efforts, uh,
hadn't been good.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.599
And that we'd wasted money.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.523
Allergan was functioning
like a proper pharmaceutical company.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.903
<i>It had a strong focus on R&amp;D.</i>

25:30.403 --> 25:33.949
<i>Mike Pearson talks a lot about</i>
<i>how R&amp;D is so inefficient</i>

25:34.032 --> 25:36.076
<i>and he doesn't want to spend money on it.</i>

25:36.159 --> 25:39.663
<i>You know, he says,</i>
<i>"Bet on management, not on science."</i>

25:40.789 --> 25:42.082
Our operating committee...

25:42.165 --> 25:44.876
[Pyott] <i>From, uh, </i>
<i>Bill Ackman's perspective,</i>

25:44.960 --> 25:47.837
<i>I think he was, uh, very enamored,</i>

25:47.921 --> 25:54.552
and maybe I could use the word beguiled,
uh, by, um, Mike Pearson's pitches.

25:55.095 --> 26:01.184
Our job, Howard and mine, and Ari's job
is to create value for our shareholders.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.187
I found the first pharmaceutical CEO
that I could actually,

26:04.271 --> 26:06.481
"Hey, I could think about
investing in this business."

26:06.564 --> 26:09.567
And this is a business
that has an incredible story.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.112
[McLean] <i>There's a book called </i>
The Outsiders

26:12.195 --> 26:14.364
<i>that became, sort of,</i>
<i>cult reading on Wall Street,</i>

26:14.447 --> 26:17.951
<i>and it celebrates CEOs</i>
<i>who are mavericks in their industry.</i>

26:18.034 --> 26:20.328
[Ackman] <i>So, we think the only problem</i>
<i>with the book</i>

26:20.412 --> 26:21.705
<i>-is they left Mike off the book,</i>
-[laughter]

26:21.788 --> 26:24.082
so he'll be, I guess,
in the second edition.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.667
[McLean] <i>Bill thought </i>
<i>that in Mike Pearson,</i>

26:25.750 --> 26:27.335
<i>he had found another outsider</i>

26:27.419 --> 26:29.838
who was every bit as legendary

26:29.921 --> 26:33.091
as the people
who are celebrated in this book.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.552
There are copies of the book
as our gift to you.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.636
Encourage you to read it.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.306
It seems in a weird way to me

26:39.389 --> 26:42.267
that Bill Ackman
developed a huge crush on Mike Pearson.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.060
Um...

26:44.561 --> 26:46.813
[stuttering]
Why did you feel it necessary

26:46.896 --> 26:50.608
to team up with Bill,
as charming as he is?

26:51.860 --> 26:54.654
-[Pearson] He's charming?
-[laughter]

26:54.738 --> 26:57.073
He was willing to invest $4 billion in us.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.576
Um, or in this transaction.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.747
[stammering] I also think that he has

27:04.456 --> 27:06.708
real credibility in terms
of being a smart investor.

27:07.334 --> 27:11.087
If Allergan does not want
to negotiate with you,

27:11.171 --> 27:12.547
uh, what are the next steps?

27:12.630 --> 27:15.925
Well, maybe we should ask
the 10% owner of Allergan.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.680
So what we do for a living,
is we buy stakes in companies, uh,

27:20.764 --> 27:24.768
and we work with them to help them
do the right thing for shareholders.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.353
And that's what we're gonna do here.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.689
We have all kinds of ways
of making that happen.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.107
[laughter]

27:31.191 --> 27:35.320
What Ackman basically did was quietly
acquire this stake in Allergan

27:35.403 --> 27:39.074
in order to help Valeant
with its takeover attempt.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.076
And you look at that on the outside
and you think,

27:41.159 --> 27:43.495
"That's got to be insider trading.
That can't be legal."

27:43.578 --> 27:46.206
You're actually permitted to trade
on inside information

27:46.289 --> 27:49.125
as long as you didn't receive
the information

27:49.209 --> 27:50.126
from someone who's breached...

27:50.210 --> 27:51.878
[McLean]<i> Even at the time, people said,</i>

27:51.961 --> 27:53.922
<i>"Well, I guess he's checked</i>
<i>the letter of the law,</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:55.715
but this doesn't smell right to us."

27:55.799 --> 28:00.970
So it was a controversial company
trying to take over a beloved company

28:01.054 --> 28:04.974
using incredibly controversial tactics.
The whole thing was ugly.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.062
We really question

28:09.145 --> 28:12.941
the sustainability of the Valeant
business model in its entirety.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.736
They are proposing cutting R&amp;D 90%.

28:16.820 --> 28:22.075
We personally take the view
that is value destruction, not creation.

28:22.158 --> 28:25.036
To us, it was very clear
that their approach

28:25.120 --> 28:27.831
was, uh, in plain English,
"asset stripping."

28:28.581 --> 28:31.209
[McLean]<i> They launched this devastating</i>
<i>counterattack.</i>

28:31.292 --> 28:32.919
Basically calling Valeant a fraud.

28:33.711 --> 28:37.632
<i>They even compared it to Tyco,</i>
<i>which was a notorious 1990s company</i>

28:37.715 --> 28:40.051
<i>where the CEO ended up going to prison.</i>

28:41.177 --> 28:43.888
What's going on at Allergan,
I think is unprecedented.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.767
It's completely inappropriate,
possibly illegal.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.730
Having Bill, um, out there in the public,
you know, he doesn't give up.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.315
Uh, we don't give up either.
So, I think that helps...

28:54.399 --> 28:58.111
[McLean]<i> Most people, at least quietly,</i>
<i>were on Allergan's side.</i>

28:58.194 --> 28:59.696
A prominent Wall Streeter said to me,

28:59.779 --> 29:02.031
"It's like the dirty drunk
attacking your beloved uncle."

29:02.866 --> 29:05.285
[Betty Liu] The scuttlebutt
was that, if you were gonna sell,

29:05.368 --> 29:07.954
it was gonna be to anybody else
but Valeant. Is that right?

29:08.037 --> 29:11.916
Really, the prime objective
was to prevent Valeant

29:12.000 --> 29:14.836
from stealing us
at a ridiculously low price.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.297
[Pyott] <i>We had a big fight on our hands.</i>

29:17.380 --> 29:21.801
But for Allergan, there is a good
and happy end to this whole tale.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.723
[McLean] <i>Allergan found another bidder,</i>
<i>a company called Actavis,</i>

29:26.806 --> 29:31.019
<i>and acquired it for a higher price</i>
<i>than Valeant was willing or able to pay.</i>

29:34.105 --> 29:36.191
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>Valeant was front page news.</i>

29:36.274 --> 29:38.693
And with the attention came scrutiny.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.278
Why are you short?

29:40.361 --> 29:43.156
[McLean] <i>Jim Chanos, </i>
<i>who's a very well-known short seller,</i>

29:43.239 --> 29:46.034
<i>started to talk about all the flaws</i>
<i>in Valeant's business model.</i>

29:47.202 --> 29:49.829
<i>Chanos forwards all his work</i>
<i>to Bill Ackman and says,</i>

29:49.913 --> 29:53.625
<i>"You're making a mistake on this company.</i>
<i>I think it's got real problems."</i>

29:53.708 --> 29:56.127
And unfortunately,
Jim does not have Valeant right.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.090
[McLean] <i>Bill Ackman would have </i>
<i>walked away from the Allergan deal</i>

30:01.174 --> 30:02.425
<i>with a great deal of money</i>

30:02.509 --> 30:06.429
<i>because Allergan's stock price went up</i>
<i>quite a bit during this exercise.</i>

30:07.680 --> 30:09.307
But he didn't walk away.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.976
Instead, he took all that money
and then some

30:12.060 --> 30:14.604
and acquired a huge stake in Valeant.

30:15.647 --> 30:19.317
<i>He didn't seem to recognize</i>
<i>what other people saw so clearly.</i>

30:20.777 --> 30:22.946
[Hempton] <i>Bill is a funny guy.</i>

30:23.029 --> 30:25.114
I think there's a Wall Street expression
for this.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.784
It's, um, "Often wrong, never in doubt."

30:29.160 --> 30:31.663
<i>And people who are often wrong,</i>
<i>never in doubt,</i>

30:31.746 --> 30:34.499
<i>are very good to trade against.</i>

30:34.582 --> 30:36.000
<i>They will double up,</i>

30:36.084 --> 30:39.671
<i>they have large amounts of money</i>
<i>to bet when they're wrong,</i>

30:39.754 --> 30:41.965
<i>and Bill truly believes it.</i>

30:47.387 --> 30:49.973
[Boyd] <i>The American system takes</i>
<i>our best and brightest people,</i>

30:50.056 --> 30:52.559
<i>of which Bill Ackman</i>
<i>is certainly a member.</i>

30:52.642 --> 30:56.896
And they get paid outlandish sums
to look the other way.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.525
<i>If you're Bill Ackman</i>
<i>or other people like him,</i>

31:00.608 --> 31:02.318
<i>they invent rationalizations around it.</i>

31:05.238 --> 31:07.156
[Hempton] <i>These big-name </i>
<i>hedge fund managers</i>

31:07.240 --> 31:10.660
are just as capable of cognitive
dissonance as everybody else.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.162
The skeptics came out of the woodwork

31:13.246 --> 31:16.291
around the time
of the Allergan bid in 2014,

31:16.374 --> 31:19.127
and for the next year or so
they couldn't have looked more wrong

31:19.210 --> 31:22.130
as Valeant stock just went higher
and higher and higher.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.550
[David Faber] You came out
of the Allergan fight a loser.

31:25.633 --> 31:29.345
But there are those who'll say,
this company is only built to acquire.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.639
I don't think we were a loser.
We were disciplined.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.850
A lot of analysts are expecting
some more M&amp;A.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.769
That's your business model.
Can we expect more big M&amp;A from you guys?

31:36.853 --> 31:39.314
We'll absolutely
start getting back in M&amp;A.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.359
Valeant is now buying bankrupt
cancer vaccine maker Dendreon.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.112
It is the deal of the day,
if not one of the biggest of the year.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.823
Valeant agreeing to buy
Salix Pharmaceuticals for a hundred...

31:48.907 --> 31:50.825
You're never gonna stop
doing deals, are you?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.202
Uh, probably not. Life would get boring.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.084
The market was dismissing
the skeptics' concerns. End of story.

32:01.669 --> 32:06.007
All I hear is, "Valeant is brilliant.
Bill Ackman's a genius.

32:06.090 --> 32:10.720
Mike Pearson is changing the landscape
of American pharmaceutical management."

32:10.803 --> 32:13.556
And then, I'm here saying,
"I think they're very wrong."

32:14.390 --> 32:18.394
<i>So, I'm on a message board</i>
<i>called cafepharma.com.</i>

32:18.478 --> 32:21.898
<i>And I see a bunch</i>
<i>of ex-Valeant sales executives</i>

32:21.981 --> 32:24.484
<i>griping about something called Philidor.</i>

32:25.860 --> 32:27.946
<i>Another ex-Valeant rep says,</i>

32:28.029 --> 32:30.907
<i>"What's Philidor?</i>
<i>I've never even heard of it."</i>

32:32.659 --> 32:36.412
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>"We're trying to keep it on the down low.</i>

32:36.496 --> 32:38.706
<i>No one really</i>
<i>is supposed to know about it."</i>

32:39.958 --> 32:41.751
As a reporter when you hear the--

32:41.834 --> 32:44.587
You know, the magic phrase,
"No one's supposed to know about it,"

32:44.671 --> 32:47.799
it's kind of like a teenage boy
looking at <i>Playboy.</i>

32:47.882 --> 32:49.467
"I want to know about it."

32:54.472 --> 32:59.477
<i>I found something</i>
<i>in the California Pharmacy Board decision,</i>

32:59.560 --> 33:04.899
<i>that denied Philidor the license</i>
<i>to operate as a pharmacy.</i>

33:04.983 --> 33:07.944
<i>So right then and there</i>
<i>I know Philidor's a pharmacy.</i>

33:08.152 --> 33:12.949
I call up the California Pharmacy Board
and they tell me,

33:13.032 --> 33:16.244
"Read that decision closely.
We think Philidor's a fraud."

33:20.289 --> 33:22.291
[Hempton]
<i>Roddy was the first person to say</i>

33:22.375 --> 33:26.212
that Philidor was specifically a device
to rip off insurance companies.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.798
On the face of it,
it was just a mail-order pharmacy.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.844
[Boyd]
<i>It's designed to be kind of user-friendly.</i>

33:32.927 --> 33:37.265
<i>Low co-pays, three months' supply</i>
<i>on your doorstep the next day.</i>

33:37.348 --> 33:40.143
<i>The patient doesn't have to go</i>
<i>to CVS or Walgreens,</i>

33:40.226 --> 33:43.688
but the prices are incredibly high.

33:43.771 --> 33:48.026
I mean, they're charging
hundreds of dollars for Retin-A.

33:48.109 --> 33:51.571
Clearer skin in two weeks?
It's possible with Retin-A Micro...

33:51.654 --> 33:54.282
[Boyd] <i>This is the economic engine </i>
<i>of Valeant.</i>

33:54.365 --> 33:59.871
[man] Toe nail fungus? Don't hide it!
Tackle it with new FDA-approved Jublia!

33:59.954 --> 34:01.539
[Boyd] <i>Jublia, foot fungus cream,</i>

34:01.622 --> 34:04.292
<i>that if you actually look into it,</i>
<i>often doesn't work.</i>

34:04.375 --> 34:07.462
Almost $1,000 per.
I mean, it's incredible.

34:07.545 --> 34:10.381
This would have been found out
by the customer straight away

34:10.465 --> 34:13.301
if they were asked to pay $1,000
for their vitamin A cream,

34:13.384 --> 34:16.637
but that money was stuck
to the insurance companies.

34:17.430 --> 34:21.434
<i>Thousands of scripts for expensive drugs</i>
<i>were coming from Philidor.</i>

34:22.685 --> 34:25.021
<i>But the insurance companies</i>
<i>started getting wise</i>

34:25.104 --> 34:28.649
<i>and they started rejecting more</i>
<i>of the scripts that came from Philidor.</i>

34:28.733 --> 34:32.695
<i>So, Philidor would buy</i>
<i>a suburban pharmacy.</i>

34:32.779 --> 34:37.116
<i>And then they would pretend that</i>
<i>the script came through that pharmacy.</i>

34:37.200 --> 34:41.245
<i>But the problem is, you can't buy enough</i>
<i>suburban pharmacies</i>

34:41.329 --> 34:43.664
<i>to deceive the insurance companies.</i>

34:43.748 --> 34:47.460
So, maybe you could start inventing
fake suburban pharmacies,

34:47.543 --> 34:51.089
and I guess you can invent as many fake
suburban pharmacies as you want.

34:52.715 --> 34:57.011
<i>In Delaware, 70 different pharmacies</i>
<i>were registered by the same lawyer.</i>

35:03.434 --> 35:07.605
<i>My staff member goes down them and says,</i>
<i>"Isn't that a character from </i>The Shining?"

35:09.148 --> 35:11.984
Mr. Hallorann?
Are you scared of this place?

35:14.112 --> 35:17.281
No, scared of nothin' here.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.325
It's just that,

35:20.618 --> 35:23.079
you know, some places are like people.

35:24.288 --> 35:27.416
Some shine, and some don't.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.337
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel here

35:31.420 --> 35:33.923
<i>has something almost like shining.</i>

35:37.093 --> 35:38.594
Hello, Danny.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.306
They're Stephen King novels.

35:46.310 --> 35:51.107
[Boyd] <i>I had to connect, inarguably,</i>
<i>Valeant and Philidor.</i>

35:51.482 --> 35:54.735
Because Philidor was an actual,
literal smoking gun.

35:56.946 --> 35:59.031
<i>So, what is a Philidor?</i>

35:59.532 --> 36:00.950
It's a chess reference.

36:02.368 --> 36:06.080
<i>It's a reference to a famous</i>
<i>French chess player</i>

36:06.164 --> 36:08.833
<i>of the, uh, 18th and 19th centuries.</i>

36:10.126 --> 36:14.130
<i>I started throwing other chess terms</i>
<i>into search engines</i>

36:14.213 --> 36:17.800
<i>and I came up with one</i>
<i>that connected into Valeant</i>

36:17.884 --> 36:20.344
<i>and that was King's Gambit Accepted.</i>

36:22.471 --> 36:26.309
King's Gambit Accepted
in chess speak is KGA.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.814
<i>Buried in Valeant's 2014 annual report,</i>

36:31.898 --> 36:35.818
<i>KGA was disclosed</i>
<i>as being owned by Valeant.</i>

36:39.280 --> 36:46.204
<i>Eventually, I found one state that had KGA</i>
<i>as the owner of Philidor.</i>

36:57.340 --> 36:59.759
At that moment, I knew I had solved it.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.643
[Hempton] <i>Roddy Boyd worked out</i>
<i>what Philidor did.</i>

37:09.977 --> 37:12.605
Then, Roddy Boyd found R&amp;O,

37:12.688 --> 37:15.524
<i>which was a suburban pharmacy</i>
<i>in California they had bought </i>

37:15.608 --> 37:17.818
<i>in order to hide scripts.</i>

37:21.989 --> 37:25.660
[Boyd] <i>I believe that Philidor</i>
<i>was getting around the fact</i>

37:25.743 --> 37:29.455
<i>that they were denied</i>
<i>a California State Pharmacy Board license.</i>

37:29.956 --> 37:35.086
They were pulling out all the stops
to lie to people, to cover it all up.

37:39.131 --> 37:41.175
<i>R&amp;O Pharmacy was a cutout.</i>

38:01.070 --> 38:04.949
<i>One day, R&amp;O Pharmacy gets a demand letter</i>

38:05.032 --> 38:09.704
<i>for almost $70 million</i>
<i>from a guy named Robert Chai-Onn,</i>

38:09.787 --> 38:13.332
<i>who was general counsel</i>
<i>of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.</i>

38:15.334 --> 38:17.211
I mean, Valeant made a big mistake here.

38:17.295 --> 38:21.757
Valeant set the trap itself
when it had sent the letter to R&amp;O,

38:21.841 --> 38:24.051
because that opened up the Pandora's Box.

38:24.135 --> 38:28.514
I'd found enough cockroaches
and then when I didn't understand this,

38:28.597 --> 38:30.683
I would assume that there was
another cockroach behind

38:30.766 --> 38:31.892
and mostly there was.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.854
It's just that Philidor was a rather big
cockroach to find. [chuckles]

38:34.937 --> 38:37.732
John Hempton,
along with this other band of skeptics,

38:37.815 --> 38:41.736
had been doing a lot of work into Philidor
and he knew it was about to come out

38:41.819 --> 38:44.405
and so he sent Bill Ackman
just a one-word note.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.407
It was exactly the line from <i>The Graduate.</i>

38:48.326 --> 38:52.621
I just want to say one word to you.
Just one word.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.081
"Are you listening?"

38:54.165 --> 38:55.624
-Are you listening?
-Yes, I am.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.168
Philidor.

38:59.545 --> 39:02.381
[Boyd] <i>When Bill Ackman</i>
<i>initially bought his huge stake,</i>

39:02.465 --> 39:05.217
<i>Philidor probably wasn't apparent to him.</i>

39:05.301 --> 39:07.887
<i>But his staff had been through Philidor.</i>

39:07.970 --> 39:11.557
<i>He could get material non-public</i>
<i>information on Valeant.</i>

39:11.640 --> 39:14.393
He had been legally an insider
in the company.

39:16.562 --> 39:21.192
[Hempton] <i>The truth is usually</i>
<i>a simple story and it's not hidden.</i>

39:21.692 --> 39:27.365
<i>But lies are well hidden</i>
<i>and this one had lots and lots of lies.</i>

39:28.449 --> 39:29.909
<i>They didn't have enough cash,</i>

39:29.992 --> 39:33.120
<i>so they invented Philidor</i>
<i>so that they'd get more cash.</i>

39:33.204 --> 39:35.164
<i>And they bought this Syprine drug,</i>

39:35.247 --> 39:37.083
<i>which they started ripping off people</i>

39:37.166 --> 39:39.210
<i>to the tune</i>
<i>of a quarter of a billion dollars</i>

39:39.293 --> 39:41.128
<i>by holding a gun at their head.</i>

39:42.338 --> 39:44.924
Revenue was going... [whistles] Right.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.842
The formula looked like it worked.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.657
Every quarter,
you go to the investors section.

40:12.034 --> 40:14.495
And most of the good stuff
is in the footnotes.

40:15.871 --> 40:18.082
So, here, it's a perfect example.

40:18.165 --> 40:21.961
They said they had higher sales of
orphan products and they cite Syprine.

40:23.170 --> 40:25.464
They didn't have higher sales.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.468
More people didn't get Wilson's disease.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.762
What they did is they raised the price.

40:33.055 --> 40:37.059
Syprine is tough because it has
a really small patient population.

40:37.977 --> 40:43.566
Yet, Valeant somehow figured out how
to turn that into a $300 million drug.

40:44.233 --> 40:49.905
Of which they probably make 250 million
in profit every year.

40:49.989 --> 40:55.244
Valeant was very good at creating
an illusion that they were growing.

40:55.744 --> 41:01.125
And they tried to manipulate the numbers
in a way that may have been legal

41:01.208 --> 41:05.379
but was certainly giving investors
the wrong impression.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.515
[Quadir] <i>When you're a short seller,</i>
<i>you want to know what the company is doing</i>

41:16.599 --> 41:18.350
<i>because they're not gonna tell you.</i>

41:19.018 --> 41:20.144
<i>I'm here on the East Coast.</i>

41:20.227 --> 41:22.563
<i>I can go to Pennsylvania</i>
<i>and New Jersey pretty easily.</i>

41:23.481 --> 41:25.483
<i>So I would kind of do a stakeout.</i>

41:33.491 --> 41:37.745
<i>The way I function</i>
<i>is I do my work in the shadows</i>

41:37.828 --> 41:41.540
<i>and I take my work and send it</i>
<i>to the appropriate authorities.</i>

41:41.957 --> 41:45.711
<i>That might mean I send my work</i>
<i>to journalists and the mainstream media</i>

41:45.794 --> 41:49.715
<i>or to Valeant's auditors or to the SEC.</i>

41:52.635 --> 41:55.971
<i>I spoke with as many Valeant employees</i>
<i>as I could.</i>

41:56.055 --> 42:00.643
<i>There was a real inflection point</i>
<i>in the morale of Valeant employees.</i>

42:01.435 --> 42:04.230
Fahmi had worked out
vast amounts that I hadn't

42:04.313 --> 42:07.441
and I had worked out
vast amounts that Fahmi hadn't.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.860
And I'm a better accountant than Fahmi,

42:09.944 --> 42:13.280
but Fahmi knows
far, far more about drugs than I do.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.491
Fahmi is a medical specialist.

42:16.408 --> 42:22.414
<i>So, all the bits that I work out about,</i>
<i>"Hey, they've raised the price,"</i>

42:22.498 --> 42:25.960
<i>Fahmi would tell me, "Uh, yeah,</i>
<i>and it's got seven generic alternatives,</i>

42:26.043 --> 42:28.587
<i>and here's why,</i>
<i>and here's why this price is silly,</i>

42:28.671 --> 42:30.839
and this is why
the system's being ripped off."

42:43.477 --> 42:46.021
[Quadir] <i>And this was</i>
<i>the second short position I ever put on</i>

42:46.105 --> 42:47.773
in my entire career.

42:47.856 --> 42:50.276
It was a huge moment for me,

42:50.359 --> 42:54.488
especially since at the time,
very few people were shorting the stock.

42:54.572 --> 42:58.075
But I, as I had said,
thought it was the perfect moment.

42:58.158 --> 43:01.829
Because I thought the balance sheet
was completely tapped out.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.290
Even though I thought
I got my timing right,

43:04.373 --> 43:11.338
I still went into the summer of 2015
with health care at all-time highs,

43:11.422 --> 43:15.217
and Valeant went
all the way up to $262 a share.

43:16.176 --> 43:21.682
I wasn't too disheartened because I had
other short sellers in my ear saying,

43:21.765 --> 43:24.018
"Fahmi, when things get tough,

43:24.101 --> 43:26.437
you just gotta stick with it
because you've done the work."

43:26.520 --> 43:29.440
So I stuck with it,
and I continued to do my work,

43:29.523 --> 43:31.650
because I was still
at that point in my career

43:31.734 --> 43:35.070
where I had to prove to everyone
that I knew what I was doing.

43:35.738 --> 43:36.572
So...

43:37.865 --> 43:43.829
after that, Hillary Clinton came out
with her tweets about drug pricing.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.498
This is a letter from someone who's here.

43:46.582 --> 43:50.961
<i>She has to take a brand name drug,</i>
<i>been taking it since the early 1980s.</i>

43:51.045 --> 43:55.466
At that time, it cost approximately
$180 for ten shots.

43:55.549 --> 44:02.097
The latest refill was $14,700
for the same ten vials.

44:02.181 --> 44:05.601
<i>And the company</i>
<i>is called Valeant Pharmaceuticals.</i>

44:05.684 --> 44:06.977
I'm going after them.

44:07.061 --> 44:11.774
This is predatory pricing and we're going
to make sure it is stopped.

44:12.775 --> 44:15.653
As a short seller,
the key thing is waiting for the catalyst.

44:15.736 --> 44:18.614
At what point do people say,
"Now it matters."

44:18.697 --> 44:21.408
And I think the election
and Shkreli were a turning point.

44:21.492 --> 44:24.495
[Jason Carroll] <i>The drug in question </i>
<i>is called Daraprim.</i>

44:24.578 --> 44:26.580
<i>It used to cost $13.50 per pill.</i>

44:26.664 --> 44:30.668
<i>Turing changed the cost</i>
<i>to a whopping $750.</i>

44:30.751 --> 44:33.712
That's price gouging, pure and simple.

44:33.796 --> 44:38.801
Did you not expect a 5,000% price increase
would result in that kind of attention?

44:38.884 --> 44:42.638
Maybe, maybe not. It depends on how, uh,
focused people want to be on the industry.

44:42.721 --> 44:45.432
There have been
much larger drug price increases

44:45.516 --> 44:46.892
by much bigger drug companies.

44:46.975 --> 44:49.103
Martin Shkreli bought Daraprim

44:49.186 --> 44:53.649
and he stuck a whole lot of cost
to insurance company and HIV patients,

44:53.732 --> 44:56.193
and he got rich. Right?

44:56.276 --> 45:00.572
Valeant didn't just do it with Daraprim,
it did it with about 100 drugs.

45:00.656 --> 45:04.493
The Valeant formula was,
"We'll do it with everything we can."

45:04.576 --> 45:08.914
This was Wall Street at its worst,
funding a drug company at its worst.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.833
When I saw Shkreli in the election,
I'm like,

45:10.916 --> 45:12.751
"It's time to dig deep and hard and fast."

45:12.835 --> 45:14.837
Some breaking news on Valeant.

45:14.920 --> 45:18.090
We had heard earlier how the stock
was tumbling. How's it going so far?

45:18.173 --> 45:20.342
It still remains sharply lower.

45:20.426 --> 45:23.303
On a report coming out
from Citron Research, which asks,

45:23.387 --> 45:27.391
"Could this be the pharmaceutical Enron?"
So quite an inflammatory report.

45:27.474 --> 45:31.478
If you read the story, you'll see
what I'm accusing Valeant of.

45:31.562 --> 45:36.275
[McLean] <i>Andrew Left is this irascible,</i>
<i>West Coast guy who weighed in on Valeant,</i>

45:36.358 --> 45:38.277
calling it the Pharmaceutical Enron.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.864
It should be noted
that his financial analysis wasn't right.

45:41.947 --> 45:44.450
He thought that Valeant was using Philidor

45:44.533 --> 45:48.787
to stuff the channel
to create sales that weren't really there

45:48.871 --> 45:50.664
and that's not quite what was happening.

45:50.747 --> 45:53.959
But he was absolutely right
in the cultural comparisons to Enron,

45:54.042 --> 45:58.255
because both companies had this culture
of trying to work the rules,

45:58.338 --> 46:02.092
not paying any attention to the ethics.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.927
Andrew Left's story is wrong.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.388
But the company can't come out
and defend it.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.974
And the reason it can't come out
and defend it is that

46:09.057 --> 46:13.187
if they defend it, they have to state
what's really happening.

46:13.270 --> 46:16.106
And ripping off Wall Street
is sort of one thing.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.025
Ripping off Middle America
is another thing.

46:18.108 --> 46:22.821
Listen, these are allegations, of course,
and often times, you don't wanna be in...

46:22.905 --> 46:25.991
I can't be in a position to tell you
whether they are true or not,

46:26.074 --> 46:28.285
but they are focused
on a drug called Philidor...

46:28.368 --> 46:31.079
[Boyd] <i>The minute attention</i>
<i>went on Philidor,</i>

46:31.163 --> 46:33.790
Valeant sales started
completely imploding.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.959
Valeant, let's take a little look
at the stock.

46:36.043 --> 46:40.422
But I'm not sure if it's, uh, continued
to move down or stabilized in any way.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.091
Where is it now?
Now it's in a complete free fall...

46:43.175 --> 46:46.803
This is about $18 billion of wealth
that has been destroyed...

46:46.887 --> 46:50.265
It's a snowball that keeps getting bigger
and bigger for Valeant.

46:50.349 --> 46:55.020
The stock has since lost $22 billion,
a fourth of its value,

46:55.103 --> 46:58.524
and whoever owns those
puts basically two million shares...

47:13.080 --> 47:15.749
[Pearson] <i>After we saw </i>
<i>the false report for Citron,</i>

47:15.832 --> 47:19.670
<i>we request that the SEC</i>
<i>investigate Mr. Left and Citron.</i>

47:19.753 --> 47:23.840
It's very nice and I feel flattered
that he's made me a poster child.

47:23.924 --> 47:28.136
But, uh,
am I the one who laid off everyone

47:28.220 --> 47:30.514
at the Bausch and Lomb research
and development department,

47:30.597 --> 47:33.225
who's raised the price
of heart medication?

47:33.308 --> 47:37.104
There's reasons why his stock is here
and it's not because of me.

47:37.187 --> 47:40.232
We'll call it what it is,
I'm a market participant.

47:40.315 --> 47:43.360
So, obviously, I was interested
in the stock price of Valeant.

47:43.443 --> 47:46.738
That being said, the outrage was

47:46.822 --> 47:53.203
when you look at Pearson and Ackman
speaking like Valeant's doing God's work.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.038
Then you're like, "Come on."

47:55.122 --> 47:58.792
If we're gonna have a fair dialogue
about this, back and forth,

47:58.875 --> 48:00.752
then let's be honest with one another.

48:00.836 --> 48:02.963
And I think what people
are really wondering about is,

48:03.046 --> 48:05.215
with all of this business with Philidor,

48:05.299 --> 48:08.969
just how much did you know
about what was going on?

48:09.052 --> 48:13.473
Lots of allegations have been made,
but, um, nothing has been proven yet.

48:13.557 --> 48:16.184
And I was unaware
of any of the allegations.

48:17.394 --> 48:18.645
[Pearson over phone] <i>Good morning...</i>

48:18.729 --> 48:21.523
[Hempton] <i>The company came out</i>
<i>with a conference call,</i>

48:21.607 --> 48:25.694
and they were distancing themselves
from Philidor as fast as they can.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.947
[Pearson speaking]

48:34.745 --> 48:38.582
But they did put
$100 million into Philidor.

48:38.665 --> 48:43.003
And the whole board of Valeant
apparently had gone to visit Philidor

48:43.086 --> 48:44.796
before they put the money in.

48:44.880 --> 48:47.341
So it's very hard to distance themselves,

48:47.424 --> 48:49.384
but that was the tone
of the conference call.

48:49.968 --> 48:51.803
[Pearson speaking]

48:54.806 --> 48:57.601
[operator speaking]

48:58.518 --> 49:01.021
One investor told me that he thought,

49:01.104 --> 49:03.982
"They'll have answers
for this on the conference call on Monday.

49:04.066 --> 49:06.610
They'll take the weekend,
they'll have this conference call,

49:06.693 --> 49:08.612
and they'll tell me
everything I need to know."

49:08.695 --> 49:11.406
And when they didn't
and were evasive on the conference call,

49:11.490 --> 49:15.285
and didn't really give answers, he said,
"That's it. I'm selling all my stock."

49:15.369 --> 49:16.828
[music playing]

49:16.912 --> 49:19.956
[Ackman speaking]

49:22.876 --> 49:24.586
Bill Ackman had a conference call,

49:25.170 --> 49:27.714
and it was really clear
from the conference call

49:27.798 --> 49:29.716
that Bill had no idea what Philidor did.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.511
[Ackman speaking]

49:48.777 --> 49:52.739
That was a conference call
that was done a little bit in delusion.

49:54.074 --> 49:55.951
-And the delusion... Oh...
-[Carr] He sounds nervous, right?

49:56.034 --> 49:59.538
Do you remember that?
He was very nervous...

49:59.621 --> 50:02.791
He was nervous, except he bet
another billion dollars on it.

50:02.874 --> 50:05.252
[Ackman speaking]

50:17.389 --> 50:22.644
Bill wrongly or rightly started to see it
as a war of public perception.

50:22.728 --> 50:25.188
And that if he could step in

50:25.272 --> 50:29.651
and answer the questions
that Valeant wasn't answering well,

50:29.735 --> 50:33.071
it would turn the tide on this thing.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.866
I think he didn't realize
that now it had become reality,

50:35.949 --> 50:39.327
it was no longer about perception.
Reality was winning.

50:39.411 --> 50:41.455
[Ackman speaking]

50:47.169 --> 50:48.462
[line disconnects]

50:49.296 --> 50:52.299
There is this one e-mail, um,
from Bill Ackman

50:52.382 --> 50:56.011
<i>to Pearson </i>
<i>and others at Valeant, saying...</i>

50:56.094 --> 50:59.055
<i>"When every state trooper follows you,</i>

50:59.139 --> 51:01.975
<i>even if you're not guilty,</i>
<i>you'll get charged with something."</i>

51:07.606 --> 51:10.150
[McLean] <i>Just when you think</i>
<i>things can't get worse,</i>

51:10.233 --> 51:13.987
<i>the news breaks that Pearson has</i>
<i>to take medical leave from the company.</i>

51:15.238 --> 51:17.240
<i>There is a fair amount of speculation</i>

51:17.324 --> 51:20.619
<i>that his very hard-living lifestyle</i>
<i>caught up with him.</i>

51:20.702 --> 51:23.997
<i>But there's no question </i>
<i>that he was very, very, very sick.</i>

51:29.085 --> 51:31.671
<i>But even though Pearson</i>
<i>had led them to this point,</i>

51:31.755 --> 51:35.342
<i>they all seemed to believe he was </i>
<i>the only one who could save them.</i>

51:35.592 --> 51:37.594
So back Mike Pearson comes.

51:42.641 --> 51:44.559
[Pearson speaking]

51:47.312 --> 51:50.732
Mike Pearson disappeared from the scene

51:50.816 --> 51:55.362
just as the Philidor thing was getting
to the point of Philidor being one-off,

51:55.445 --> 51:58.740
to Philidor being indicative
of the whole structure.

51:59.449 --> 52:01.284
[Pearson speaking]

52:07.874 --> 52:12.212
With him away for a month and a half,
he couldn't control the narrative anymore.

52:12.796 --> 52:16.216
[Pearson continues speaking]

52:24.850 --> 52:27.727
[investor speaking]

52:30.480 --> 52:31.731
[Pearson speaking]

52:37.571 --> 52:41.157
There was a lot of drama
that came out,

52:41.241 --> 52:44.536
that was leaked to the press,
around Pearson.

52:44.619 --> 52:46.454
Well, what about
the whole Philidor aspect of...

52:46.538 --> 52:48.498
[Quadir] <i>ValueAct was obviously </i>
<i>on the board,</i>

52:48.582 --> 52:50.333
<i>so they wanted to keep Pearson around.</i>

52:50.417 --> 52:52.752
Do you think Michael Pearson
is still the guy for this job?

52:52.836 --> 52:56.089
Mike, he's a great problem solver
and we're solving problems as we speak.

52:56.172 --> 52:59.926
Really being as determined
as we can be to solve his problems.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.929
We think Mike
is the right guy for the job now.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.848
-[applause]
-Bill Ackman is here.

53:04.931 --> 53:08.685
[Quadir] <i>But Ackman, who started</i>
<i>to ramp up his activism in Valeant,</i>

53:08.768 --> 53:11.396
<i>did not want Pearson around.</i>

53:11.479 --> 53:12.772
So what did we miss?

53:12.856 --> 53:15.734
We missed that someone
with a superb track record

53:15.817 --> 53:17.819
of making acquisitions
could do something...

53:17.903 --> 53:20.030
Mike Pearson went crazy, in my opinion.

53:21.156 --> 53:22.490
<i>First weekend on the board, </i>

53:22.574 --> 53:25.577
<i>uh, we convinced the rest of the board </i>
<i>that Mike had to go.</i>

53:25.660 --> 53:29.956
<i>I was the guy the board asked to call him</i>
<i>to tell him he was fired.</i>

53:32.334 --> 53:37.589
[Hempton] <i>Ackman effectively</i>
<i>took control of the board.</i>

53:37.672 --> 53:39.925
<i>He fired Pearson,</i>

53:40.008 --> 53:43.887
<i>he got people to the board</i>
<i>who were all friends of his.</i>

53:43.970 --> 53:46.097
Then the stock continued going down.

53:46.181 --> 53:49.392
This whole thing
made a mockery of this idea

53:49.476 --> 53:53.897
that a company with this august hedge fund
on its board was a well-managed company,

53:53.980 --> 53:59.653
because it was all just a complete, um,
swear-word show. [chuckles]

53:59.736 --> 54:00.737
[Carr] You can swear.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.281
It was all a complete shitshow.
It really was.

54:03.365 --> 54:08.078
It was just a disastrous, uh, couple
of weeks that have to go down in history

54:08.161 --> 54:12.540
as the worst crisis management ever.

54:16.878 --> 54:19.297
[Quadir] <i>Mike Pearson went</i>
<i>from being a billionaire on paper</i>

54:19.381 --> 54:22.550
<i>because of the work he did at Valeant</i>
<i>and the deals he made,</i>

54:22.634 --> 54:24.552
<i>to being a potential criminal</i>

54:24.636 --> 54:27.639
<i>and being investigated</i>
<i>on some very serious claims.</i>

54:27.722 --> 54:31.643
<i>So I can't imagine</i>
<i>what goes on in his mind.</i>

54:33.311 --> 54:35.939
[Carr] What would you say to Mike
if he were sitting here?

54:36.523 --> 54:37.691
Good luck.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.279
[gavel banging]

54:43.363 --> 54:47.450
[Susan Collins] The hearing will
come to order. Senator McCaskill.

54:47.534 --> 54:53.123
Thank you. According
to your SEC filings, Mr. Pearson,

54:53.206 --> 55:00.171
beginning in first quarter of 2013
through the third quarter of 2015,

55:00.880 --> 55:04.926
you state in your filings
that your revenue,

55:05.010 --> 55:09.681
changes in revenue have been driven
primarily by price.

55:10.223 --> 55:13.977
Um, yes, uh, pricing has driven
more growth than volume,

55:14.060 --> 55:16.229
although that is changing over time.

55:16.313 --> 55:19.399
The average price of your top 30 products

55:19.482 --> 55:23.570
is up 78% over last year.

55:25.864 --> 55:31.328
Now, you can't attribute that to R&amp;D
'cause you don't spend that much on R&amp;D.

55:31.411 --> 55:35.957
Uh, we spend 8% of our pharmaceutical
revenue on R&amp;D.

55:36.041 --> 55:38.626
Whoa. Mr. Schiller, didn't you agree
in the hearing in the House

55:38.710 --> 55:40.712
it was actually 3%?

55:40.795 --> 55:42.839
Do I need to pull that testimony out?

55:43.590 --> 55:46.926
[clears throat] My recollection was I said
it's 3% of total revenue.

55:47.010 --> 55:49.637
Right. This is the business model.

55:49.721 --> 55:54.726
This was not, um, researchers
or scientists or academicians

55:54.809 --> 55:57.103
that were trying to buy
a pharmaceutical company

55:57.187 --> 55:59.272
in order to promote new drugs.

55:59.355 --> 56:01.399
This was purely a hedge fund move.

56:01.483 --> 56:04.319
You can create as much value acquiring

56:05.195 --> 56:09.074
small, fast-growing companies
that develop drugs

56:09.157 --> 56:11.910
as you can by developing them yourselves.

56:11.993 --> 56:14.871
-But doesn't that require price increases?
-[Ackman] No.

56:14.954 --> 56:18.124
Wait a minute. You're telling me
you're gonna go buy a company

56:18.208 --> 56:20.377
-that's selling a drug for price X.
-[Ackman] Right.

56:20.460 --> 56:24.089
And you're gonna give them a price for
their company and, therefore, that drug.

56:24.172 --> 56:27.467
-[Ackman] Correct.
-And that's gonna be a profit for them?

56:27.550 --> 56:29.260
-[Ackman] Very much so, yes.
-Yeah.

56:29.344 --> 56:32.389
And then you're gonna take that drug
and charge the same price

56:32.472 --> 56:36.059
after you have put your capital
and given them a profit?

56:36.142 --> 56:38.603
-Don't you have to raise the price?
-No, I think--

56:38.686 --> 56:41.731
Can you find me one drug
that Valeant didn't raise the price on?

56:41.815 --> 56:44.234
I don't know off-hand.
[stammers] I don't have the price list.

56:44.317 --> 56:45.944
Mr. Pearson? One drug.

56:47.487 --> 56:49.781
That you didn't raise the price on
after you acquired it?

56:49.864 --> 56:51.199
[Pearson] Not in the United States.

56:51.282 --> 56:54.160
They found a drug that had a monopoly.

56:54.702 --> 56:59.874
They bought the company,
stripped out all the R&amp;D in the company.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.002
Made no changes to the drug,

57:03.086 --> 57:08.133
and then jacked the price
up 300, 400, 500, 700%.

57:08.216 --> 57:11.302
And the American people
were left holding the bag.

57:12.220 --> 57:15.932
[stammers] Mr. Ackman, Exhibit Number 81

57:16.015 --> 57:22.439
is an e-mail you received in January 2015
from a man by the name of Drew Katz.

57:24.691 --> 57:26.443
<i>He had Wilson's disease.</i>

57:29.279 --> 57:32.115
I first was diagnosed
in the very early '80s.

57:33.658 --> 57:38.204
<i>I'm a lucky one.</i>
<i>I'll have my medicine one way or another.</i>

57:41.458 --> 57:45.295
When you invest in a hedge fund,
you're investing in managers

57:45.378 --> 57:48.089
and the managers are then
going to invest your money.

57:48.173 --> 57:52.844
Once it was disclosed
what, uh, the hedge fund owned

57:52.927 --> 57:57.140
and I saw that it owned
a lot of Valeant Pharmaceuticals,

57:59.142 --> 58:04.189
it was really, um, challenging.

58:04.606 --> 58:06.149
It was very challenging for me.

58:06.232 --> 58:08.067
-He had contacted you...
-[Ackman] Yes.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.445
...about the incredible problem

58:10.528 --> 58:14.741
and the fact that death could result
if people couldn't get this drug.

58:14.824 --> 58:15.658
[Ackman] Absolutely.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.827
-And the incredible increase in price.
-Yes.

58:17.911 --> 58:21.122
-You called Mr. Pearson.
-I sent him an e-mail.

58:21.206 --> 58:23.041
My understanding
from you talking with the committee

58:23.124 --> 58:26.503
is that he assured you that
anybody who needed help could get it.

58:26.586 --> 58:29.923
Did you follow up to see what they
had done about the price of this drug?

58:30.006 --> 58:31.674
No, I took him at his word.

58:31.758 --> 58:35.053
[stammers] We have invested,
and for many years

58:35.136 --> 58:37.305
since I joined the company,

58:37.388 --> 58:42.685
uh, heavily in patient assistance programs
so we follow up patient by patient.

58:42.769 --> 58:46.648
Their PR that
they had patient assistance programs

58:46.731 --> 58:50.735
and it was really helping families
that couldn't afford the drug,

58:50.818 --> 58:52.779
we certainly heard testimony
from people that said

58:52.862 --> 58:54.531
that couldn't be further from the truth.

58:56.908 --> 58:59.786
[John] <i>Whenever you see </i>
<i>a big increase in a drug,</i>

58:59.869 --> 59:02.413
<i>what the drug company will do </i>
<i>is they'll come out and say, </i>

59:02.497 --> 59:04.499
<i>"If you can't afford it, it's free."</i>

59:04.958 --> 59:08.419
All they're doing
is trying to keep the patients quiet

59:09.087 --> 59:11.881
so the insurer will pay the whole bill.

59:12.715 --> 59:14.551
But that's not how that works.

59:14.634 --> 59:18.471
All insurance is pooled money.
Everyone pays for this.

59:18.555 --> 59:22.934
That is why our insurance is so expensive.
Those costs get passed on to us.

59:23.017 --> 59:25.812
This is a cost that's being spread to you.

59:25.895 --> 59:30.692
This is why health care, generally,
is so damn expensive.

59:45.456 --> 59:48.376
Valeant became
one of the most egregious examples,

59:48.459 --> 59:49.502
but they're far from alone.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.879
Huge price hikes
over the past five years...

59:51.963 --> 59:54.924
[McLean] <i>Other companies were set up</i>
<i>precisely to do the same thing.</i>

59:55.008 --> 59:56.843
[Norah O'Donnell] The price of insulin
more than tripled

59:56.926 --> 59:58.636
to more than $700 per patient...

59:58.720 --> 1:00:00.305
[Anne Thompson]
<i>Fifteen new cancer drugs </i>

1:00:00.388 --> 1:00:02.557
<i>that cost more than $10,000 a month...</i>

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:07.270
[reporter] <i>EpiPen prices are</i>
<i>increasing by 400% since 2008.</i>

1:00:07.353 --> 1:00:11.524
All of biopharma's earnings growth
last year came from drug price increases.

1:00:12.567 --> 1:00:15.445
I texted our board chair
while I was listening to the hearing

1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:16.738
and suggested we have
a board call tomorrow

1:00:16.821 --> 1:00:20.241
to discuss, uh, the drugs
that are the subject of today's hearing.

1:00:20.325 --> 1:00:24.120
And my recommendation is gonna be
to reduce the prices of those drugs.

1:00:24.787 --> 1:00:27.790
I'm sitting in my office,
watching it on a web stream,

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:30.710
and you see Ackman say,
"That's it, we surrender.

1:00:31.544 --> 1:00:34.088
I'm texting the board,
we're lowering the prices."

1:00:35.757 --> 1:00:36.591
And a giant...

1:00:37.675 --> 1:00:41.387
You kind of exhale, and say,
"That's it, we won! It's over."

1:00:43.556 --> 1:00:45.475
A year later, nothing's changed.

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:51.773
<i>We've been successful, </i>
<i>had some good articles written. </i>

1:00:51.856 --> 1:00:54.901
<i>We did try to shame 'em. </i>
<i>I thought that would do it.</i>

1:00:57.111 --> 1:01:01.074
<i>And sometimes you say to yourself, </i>
<i>"Why fight this fight?" </i>

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:03.076
<i>And I think about my daughters.</i>

1:01:03.159 --> 1:01:08.247
What if they had lost the genetic lottery?
What if they had this disease?

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:14.295
What if they had
this $300,000-a-year drug bill

1:01:14.379 --> 1:01:18.424
hanging around their neck
for the rest of their life like a stone?

1:01:19.384 --> 1:01:22.679
Their lives would be destroyed.
It'd be terrible.

1:01:22.762 --> 1:01:25.056
And it's not just my kids,
it's everybody's kids.

1:01:25.139 --> 1:01:27.850
My children would be disappointed
if I stopped fighting.

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:29.602
They wouldn't know who I was.

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:37.568
[McLean] <i>The great tragic irony is that </i>

1:01:37.652 --> 1:01:40.780
<i>their victims are now the ones</i>
<i>helping to keep the company afloat.</i>

1:01:40.863 --> 1:01:43.116
Valeant can't afford
to reduce their profits

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:45.535
by reducing the cost of these drugs.

1:01:48.079 --> 1:01:49.539
[Hempton] <i>Valeant told Congress</i>

1:01:49.622 --> 1:01:52.291
<i>that they were going to lower </i>
<i>the price of these drugs.</i>

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:53.876
<i>And then they didn't do it.</i>

1:01:54.544 --> 1:01:59.465
If they dropped the price of the drugs,
they will not be able to pay their debt.

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:04.804
Right, so Valeant's still in the business
of ripping people off to this day.

1:02:08.349 --> 1:02:10.435
[Carr] <i>And now where is it at today?</i>

1:02:10.518 --> 1:02:14.731
So today, it is at $16 and change.

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:19.402
And when investors ask me
why I'm not taking profits,

1:02:19.485 --> 1:02:22.488
I say there is still
another 16 bucks to go.

1:02:25.533 --> 1:02:30.455
We've taken seriously the requests
and the inquiries from this committee.

1:02:30.538 --> 1:02:34.959
And we have, uh, dramatically, um, taken

1:02:35.042 --> 1:02:38.004
a much more conservative approach
to pricing,

1:02:38.087 --> 1:02:40.673
and I think that we're the lowest
in the industry now

1:02:40.757 --> 1:02:42.633
over that time period in terms of pricing.

1:02:42.717 --> 1:02:44.218
So we certainly have listened.

1:02:44.719 --> 1:02:48.014
If you are an industry leader
in this area,

1:02:48.097 --> 1:02:51.058
we'll need to have a lot more
hearings with a lot more drug companies.

1:02:52.643 --> 1:02:53.853
[John] <i>Mike Pearson... </i>

1:02:53.936 --> 1:02:56.105
<i>I never really thought about him </i>
<i>on a personal level. </i>

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:59.400
<i>I just think he was a bad actor, </i>

1:02:59.484 --> 1:03:02.820
operating in an environment
where there was no rules to stop him.

1:03:02.904 --> 1:03:05.239
So he was just a pirate.

1:03:05.323 --> 1:03:07.825
I just look at him and I see a pirate.
I don't see anything else.

1:03:07.909 --> 1:03:10.536
Clearly, there were things I did
not understand about the business

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:14.499
and this was a failure of due diligence
on my part, for sure.

1:03:16.417 --> 1:03:18.711
[McLean] <i>This is the good side </i>
<i>of Bill Ackman.</i>

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:22.131
<i>I think he felt </i>
<i>that he had a responsibility to fix it.</i>

1:03:22.215 --> 1:03:25.384
Now, perhaps you might say
there is still a lot of arrogance at work

1:03:25.468 --> 1:03:26.636
in the belief that he could fix it.

1:03:28.763 --> 1:03:30.890
<i>To me, the scariest thing</i>
<i>about the Valeant story</i>

1:03:30.973 --> 1:03:34.227
<i>is this divergence between</i>
<i>what's good for investors </i>

1:03:34.310 --> 1:03:36.896
<i>and what's good for people in society.</i>

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:40.733
And, in this story,
they were two different things

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:41.859
and that didn't matter.

1:03:41.943 --> 1:03:43.402
Thank all of you for being here today,

1:03:43.486 --> 1:03:46.531
and, um, we are glad, Mr. Pearson,
you're feeling better.

1:03:46.614 --> 1:03:48.533
Thank you very much.

1:03:48.616 --> 1:03:51.828
[Carr] <i>How much of what Valeant was doing</i>
<i>and taking part in what we discussed,</i>

1:03:51.911 --> 1:03:54.914
how much of it was legal versus illegal?

1:03:54.997 --> 1:03:58.668
I think we didn't find anything
they were doing that was illegal.

1:03:58.918 --> 1:04:01.504
