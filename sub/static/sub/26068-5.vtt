02:35.640 --> 02:37.840
[Joy's therapist]
So, how was it?

02:41.320 --> 02:42.160
It was fine.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.200
I don't know.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.640
What don't you know?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.040
Well, I don't know.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.320
[chuckles]

03:00.760 --> 03:01.880
What to say...

03:02.520 --> 03:03.760
Say whatever you like.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.240
Well, I was late.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.000
It hadn't started yet.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.520
Why were you late?

03:18.000 --> 03:18.840
This and that.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.960
Can you be a little more specific?

03:24.600 --> 03:25.640
I burnt my toast.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.080
How?

03:30.160 --> 03:32.480
I see where you're going with this,
by the way.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.840
Somebody turned the toaster up to four.
Somebody who wasn't me.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.640
And I couldn't find my shoes.
Couldn't find the right shoes.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.360
[Joy's therapist] <i>Which was it?</i>

03:42.760 --> 03:46.520
You knew which shoes you were looking for
and weren't able to find them,

03:46.600 --> 03:48.200
or in general--

03:48.280 --> 03:51.080
All right! Fine, I accept.
I may have...

03:52.960 --> 03:54.920
been a little bit hesitant.

03:56.680 --> 03:57.720
And why?

03:57.960 --> 03:59.480
Was I a little bit hesitant?

04:00.480 --> 04:01.360
You tell me.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.000
[Joy] <i>I asked a registrar once...</i>

04:08.720 --> 04:12.560
I said, "Do you have a preference when it
comes to weddings versus funerals?"

04:13.720 --> 04:15.000
And she said, "Funerals."

04:16.720 --> 04:18.640
And I said, "Oh, that's interesting."

04:19.600 --> 04:21.760
She said,
"Weddings can be quite elaborate,

04:21.840 --> 04:24.480
quite a lot of voices
and opinions in the mix."

04:25.400 --> 04:27.400
Funerals, on the other hand...

04:29.160 --> 04:30.960
she said all people want to do...

04:32.880 --> 04:34.400
more often than not, anyway...

04:39.280 --> 04:40.680
they just want it to matter.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.040
To mean something.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.560
And, in general, is that how <i>you </i>feel
about weddings versus funerals?

04:51.640 --> 04:52.920
I don't know.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.920
Maybe.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.920
<i>I think probably maybe it is, yeah.</i>

05:01.280 --> 05:03.000
Would you like to give me an example?

05:05.200 --> 05:08.680
You mean an example of why
I prefer funerals to weddings?

05:09.640 --> 05:12.400
Or you mean an example of a funeral
that actually meant something to me?

05:12.960 --> 05:13.920
Whatever you like.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.320
Well, no, you tell me.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.960
I wasn't necessarily saying
I did, by the way.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.560
I wasn't necessarily suggesting
you did either.

05:25.680 --> 05:31.040
I was relaying something someone once…

05:34.600 --> 05:35.480
Indeed.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.880
But, okay, so...

05:43.200 --> 05:46.960
I mean, since we were just
talking about him,

05:49.040 --> 05:50.640
I mean, I remember...

05:52.280 --> 05:53.280
at Mum's…

05:53.360 --> 05:55.080
at my mum's…

05:59.520 --> 06:00.400
Funeral?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.040
Yeah, and...

06:06.720 --> 06:08.760
Yeah, and I remember he...

06:09.520 --> 06:12.080
Sorry, by-- When you say "he"…

06:13.440 --> 06:15.120
-Lawrence's dad.
-Graham.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.200
Yeah.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.520
'Cause my own dad had said to me,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.720
[Joy] <i>"No one wants to see a fuss</i>
<i>from you today, Joy."</i>

06:31.000 --> 06:32.880
What did he mean by that, do you think?

06:32.960 --> 06:37.840
Well, in his very own inimitable way,
he was saying,

06:38.800 --> 06:41.280
"Today's the day
to keep a lid on it, kid."

06:45.000 --> 06:48.040
Not an easy promise to adhere to
at the best of times,

06:48.120 --> 06:49.480
let alone on the day...

07:07.360 --> 07:08.320
I did okay.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.240
The strangest, I think--

07:17.360 --> 07:19.440
The strangest thing was probably...

07:21.280 --> 07:25.240
the number of people I had never met

07:26.400 --> 07:28.680
telling me how much they loved my mum.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.960
Telling me how wonderful
they thought she was.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.880
People she worked with,
people she used to go dancing with.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.080
Why strange?

07:44.280 --> 07:47.440
But then, anyway, um...

07:49.760 --> 07:53.080
so then once the...

07:54.840 --> 07:56.280
service was done,

07:58.480 --> 08:03.920
I think that's when it... really…

08:12.960 --> 08:16.560
… and he said to me, he said,

08:18.160 --> 08:19.840
"You do know, don't you,

08:19.920 --> 08:23.520
<i>that it's all right not to feel yourself</i>
<i>on a day like today?"</i>

08:27.320 --> 08:28.160
[chuckles]

08:29.440 --> 08:30.640
How nice of him.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.160
He was amazing!

08:33.320 --> 08:34.440
Lawrence's father.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.960
Yes, he was...

08:37.160 --> 08:40.120
He was an extremely generous individual.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.920
More so than your father?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.080
More so than almost anyone.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.160
Alan, I suppose, actually.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I mean, he was the only other person
when Mum died.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.400
Because at the time, um,

09:02.680 --> 09:05.560
not a lot of my friends--

09:05.640 --> 09:07.520
I mean, nobody knew what to say to me.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.320
In what sense?

09:12.040 --> 09:16.320
Well, Angela, none of them
had a dead parent.

09:19.920 --> 09:24.440
So apart from Graham
and apart from your husband…

09:25.120 --> 09:27.920
Sorry, no, at the time, me and Alan,
we weren't...

09:28.000 --> 09:28.840
-You weren't?
-No.

09:28.920 --> 09:29.920
-You were together?
-Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.120
Boyfriend and girlfriend?

09:31.600 --> 09:32.480
Yup.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.640
Yeah. We actually…

09:39.680 --> 09:44.400
How we met, actually, is quite a--

09:52.200 --> 09:55.000
I was on antibiotics 'cause I'd been
bitten by the neighbor's cat.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.600
I hated that fucking cat.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.000
So I wasn't drinking

09:58.760 --> 10:00.880
<i>and as far as I could tell,</i>

10:00.960 --> 10:04.280
<i>Alan was the only other</i>
<i>sober person at this party</i>

10:04.360 --> 10:09.320
<i>full of otherwise horrendously</i>
<i>over the top undergraduates.</i>

10:17.640 --> 10:18.600
And he said...

10:19.520 --> 10:20.960
rather sweetly, he said,

10:23.560 --> 10:25.360
<i>"I've got an essay due in tomorrow."</i>

10:25.960 --> 10:26.840
<i>And I thought...</i>

10:29.800 --> 10:30.640
I mean...

10:34.360 --> 10:36.880
I'm sorry, just to check that I've...
Um...

10:38.040 --> 10:39.880
this was during...?

10:39.960 --> 10:42.360
Oh, yeah, we met at the start
of our second year.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.320
And your mother?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.520
She died towards the end
of our third year.

10:48.800 --> 10:54.760
I see. So the two of you, in fact,
have been together for some time.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.520
Yeah, but we...

10:59.640 --> 11:02.480
we actually didn't get together until...

11:04.120 --> 11:05.600
because at that time...

11:05.840 --> 11:08.200
Well, at this particular point in time,

11:08.760 --> 11:09.640
I was...

11:10.320 --> 11:13.040
I was still, actually,

11:13.520 --> 11:15.720
still seeing Lawrence.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.120
Oh.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.080
Yeah, trying to make a go
of things long distance.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.400
And did you?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.960
-Make a go of things long distance?
-Mm-hmm.

11:24.520 --> 11:25.880
Not massively, no.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.320
I did tell him the truth.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.680
<i>I said, "Lawrence, I'm so sorry,</i>

11:36.440 --> 11:38.560
but I think I've met someone else.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.080
We haven't done anything,
we haven't kissed or anything,

11:43.160 --> 11:48.080
<i>but we have been spending</i>
<i>a fair bit of time together.</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:57.720
<i>And the more I've found myself</i>
<i>drawn to him...</i>

12:00.200 --> 12:01.760
<i>the less I find myself...</i>

12:03.880 --> 12:04.880
<i>missing you."</i>

12:07.840 --> 12:12.560
And he, you know, he said, God...

12:15.680 --> 12:18.120
He said, "What has he got that I don't?"

12:18.800 --> 12:19.720
And you said?

12:20.760 --> 12:22.880
I don't know,
something along the lines of,

12:24.080 --> 12:26.200
"He seems so in control of things."

12:27.040 --> 12:28.560
What did you mean by that?

12:30.360 --> 12:32.800
Well, all his VHS's were alphabetized!

12:39.480 --> 12:41.720
I think he knew he wanted to be a teacher.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.160
I think... he knew that about himself.

12:47.480 --> 12:52.560
And he was calm and he was organized.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.840
What about Lawrence?

12:55.120 --> 12:57.320
What did his VHS collection look like?

12:57.720 --> 13:01.080
It certainly was not alphabetized.

13:03.960 --> 13:09.600
You said earlier, we were talking
about Lawrence's father, about Graham,

13:10.280 --> 13:15.080
and you described him
as an extremely generous individual,

13:16.440 --> 13:18.440
more so than almost anyone else.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.240
And then you said, except Alan.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.960
That's because... I mean, in terms of...

13:30.240 --> 13:33.840
I asked him not to come to Mum's funeral.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.880
-Okay.
-I just didn't.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.200
And why? Please...

13:46.120 --> 13:48.640
-I didn't want him to see me like that.
-Like what?

13:50.240 --> 13:51.080
Not myself.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.680
And he hadn't met any of my family.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.040
When you say "not yourself"--

13:57.120 --> 13:59.240
I know it isn't logical,

13:59.320 --> 14:01.280
it's just how I felt at the time.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.720
So, okay, you ask him not to attend...

14:08.360 --> 14:11.840
you give him your reasons,
and he agrees or...?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.520
No... Yeah, he does.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.720
Sorry, this is when? Where are we now?

14:21.560 --> 14:25.920
I think I probably called him within
about 24 hours of Mum dying.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.120
Okay.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.600
Yeah. And then I think we spoke
maybe about a day or so later.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.240
And, again, on the phone or...?

14:37.640 --> 14:40.360
No, I mean--
Yeah, this was all over the...

14:42.320 --> 14:44.640
I see. So a day or two later.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.000
Yeah. And he...

14:48.720 --> 14:50.400
He asks about the funeral, and...

14:51.760 --> 14:54.280
he says if there's anything
he can do to help or...

14:56.200 --> 14:57.200
And you said?

14:59.960 --> 15:03.880
I said, "Alan, the truth is,

15:04.560 --> 15:08.880
we're planning on keeping things
quite small, mostly family."

15:09.960 --> 15:11.920
Which was or wasn't true?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.840
More... wasn't than was.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.840
And what was his reaction?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.080
<i>He was quiet for a bit.</i>

15:30.880 --> 15:34.080
I think I thought I pissed him off,
upset him.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.240
Mmm.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.240
Thought he didn't want to speak to me.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.000
So...

15:46.440 --> 15:47.320
in the--

15:50.080 --> 15:55.160
So, okay. So, then what happened?
What changed?

16:27.920 --> 16:28.840
He...

16:34.080 --> 16:40.200
He said he... had been a little bit upset
that I didn't want him to be there

16:40.280 --> 16:42.080
because I had asked him not to come.

16:43.240 --> 16:47.800
But not because he minded,
per se, not being there, but...

16:54.320 --> 16:58.960
the thing that had been
upsetting for him was...

17:02.240 --> 17:04.160
the thought, he said...

17:06.320 --> 17:08.600
of me being on my own, sad.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.280
Alone.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.960
Having to go through all that on my own.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.960
Oh, I knew how much he hated
people writing in books.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.000
Really?

17:32.280 --> 17:33.760
He couldn't stand it.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.640
So it meant a lot.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.960
What a law-breaker.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.440
The problem was...

18:03.920 --> 18:04.800
I...

18:05.800 --> 18:07.440
[clears throat] I, erm...

18:24.440 --> 18:25.280
Um...

19:13.200 --> 19:14.720
You've been quiet for...

19:15.080 --> 19:16.280
quite a long time now.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.200
I've been listening.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.440
And what's more...

19:32.560 --> 19:36.480
I suppose, I've been thinking...

19:40.320 --> 19:42.080
What have you been thinking about?

19:43.280 --> 19:45.920
Well, good question.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.520
About... you.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.680
Good to know.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.320
And about...

20:00.080 --> 20:00.960
how.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.240
Because what's interesting
to me, Joy...

20:06.160 --> 20:09.360
you mentioned earlier
the burnt toast, the running late,

20:10.840 --> 20:13.960
and when I pressed you
ever so slightly, you said,

20:14.040 --> 20:20.000
"Okay, fine, I'll admit it,
I was feeling somewhat hesitant."

20:22.600 --> 20:24.200
So then I'm thinking to myself,

20:25.120 --> 20:29.120
"All right,
what is there to be hesitant about?"

20:31.800 --> 20:34.440
So then I'm thinking,  but I don't say it,
I'm thinking, "Well...

20:36.040 --> 20:39.040
presumably it's Lawrence,
it's his wife, it's the...

20:40.080 --> 20:43.160
prospect of the three of you
potentially being in the same room

20:43.240 --> 20:45.680
at the same time, maybe."

20:48.040 --> 20:50.640
But then, of course, when you describe

20:50.720 --> 20:55.040
this encounter with Graham,

20:55.720 --> 20:56.920
with Lawrence's father,

20:58.560 --> 21:03.320
well, then I'm thinking to myself,
"Well, okay. Well, now I see."

21:05.120 --> 21:07.800
He clearly meant a great deal to you.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.000
Not to mention the link with your mother.

21:13.240 --> 21:19.480
And then, also there's this... pattern...

21:21.280 --> 21:25.200
of persistently overlapping partners.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.720
And what I mean by that is…

21:32.240 --> 21:38.360
when I asked you why you didn't want Alan
to attend the funeral of your mother,

21:38.440 --> 21:41.600
you said something along the lines of...

21:41.680 --> 21:43.800
That I didn't want him
to see me like that.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.040
That's right, "not yourself."

21:47.560 --> 21:53.400
As though only certain parts
of our personality, our psyche,

21:53.480 --> 21:57.600
are suitable for public consumption.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.120
And then there's the story
of your father...

22:05.240 --> 22:07.200
asking you not to make a fuss.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.960
"Nobody wants to see you
make a fuss today, Joy."

22:13.160 --> 22:18.640
I'm thinking, "What did he really mean
by that, I wonder?"

22:20.560 --> 22:21.440
Or rather...

22:22.880 --> 22:25.440
what did a statement like that...

22:27.280 --> 22:28.640
really mean to you?

22:33.920 --> 22:36.400
I think my honest feeling is...

22:39.080 --> 22:41.400
when he asked you not to make a fuss...

22:42.920 --> 22:47.560
really, he was asking you to stop feeling.

22:49.880 --> 22:50.960
To feel nothing.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.800
When we feel nothing, Joy...

23:02.280 --> 23:05.520
when we cease to feel anything at all...

23:08.520 --> 23:12.560
we lose track of what causes us pain...

23:14.880 --> 23:15.720
and why.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.600
Not to mention what excites us,

23:21.760 --> 23:22.880
delights us.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.240
So then I'm thinking to myself, "Well...

23:30.720 --> 23:32.840
of course you had sex.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.160
Of course you did, with Lawrence."

23:37.200 --> 23:40.400
Because I suspect you wanted...

23:43.200 --> 23:47.200
you <i>needed...</i> to feel something.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.160
I told him, by the way.

24:06.480 --> 24:07.320
Alan.

24:10.040 --> 24:10.920
The truth.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.440
And?

24:52.440 --> 24:54.440
[no audible dialogue]

25:39.520 --> 25:40.360
[door opens]

25:48.920 --> 25:49.800
Water?

26:22.920 --> 26:27.280
Joy, I wanted to ask you about something
we talked about last week.

26:28.160 --> 26:32.240
We were discussing Josh,
Joshua and Emily Riley.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.960
And you said...

26:36.880 --> 26:41.880
"They said it was his last call he made,"
you said.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.480
The last call he made?

26:46.720 --> 26:47.600
Yeah.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.800
And by "they"? Just to double-check...

26:51.880 --> 26:52.760
The police.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.240
So...

26:54.960 --> 26:58.240
Okay, so it was the police
who informed you.

26:58.760 --> 27:02.040
Yeah, they said... they explained...

27:02.120 --> 27:04.680
I mean, I can't remember the exact...

27:04.760 --> 27:05.640
It's all right.

27:06.880 --> 27:07.840
Um...

27:10.680 --> 27:14.160
From the evidence that had been...

27:14.480 --> 27:15.320
Mm-hmm?

27:16.760 --> 27:17.600
...recovered...

27:17.720 --> 27:18.560
Mm-hmm?

27:19.200 --> 27:21.520
...the last call the deceased made...

27:26.320 --> 27:27.280
Was to you.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.840
And this was at your house?

27:37.840 --> 27:39.080
The call or the...?

27:39.160 --> 27:42.080
No, sorry, when the police...

27:44.840 --> 27:46.440
Yeah, I was at home.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.360
At the house.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.320
They knocked on the...

27:56.160 --> 27:58.480
Said, "Would I mind?" And I said, "No.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.400
Would either of you like
a cup of tea or a coffee?"

28:03.920 --> 28:06.480
[Angela] <i>Sorry, just to make sure…</i>

28:09.800 --> 28:13.360
how much at this point in time

28:13.440 --> 28:17.240
were you or were you not aware of?

28:18.760 --> 28:19.880
Aware of what?

28:20.680 --> 28:24.240
Well, that... something was wrong?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.040
Or might be?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.680
You mean did I know he was dead?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.960
[no audible dialogue]

28:50.000 --> 28:51.040
Shocking, then.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.200
It must have come
as quite a shock to you.

29:02.600 --> 29:06.360
-So…
-Sorry, I'm slightly struggling to…

29:07.320 --> 29:08.200
Please, please...

29:09.360 --> 29:11.760
I mean, this was months ago.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.440
It was, that's true.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.360
Best part of a year. I mean--

29:21.400 --> 29:24.680
Would you rather we talked
about something else instead?

29:26.360 --> 29:29.400
Angela, I can see your notes,
I can see them sitting right there

29:29.480 --> 29:32.240
so I'm not quite sure
why I'm being asked to repeat myself.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.120
You're frustrated?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.240
No, I'm...

29:39.960 --> 29:42.240
It feels a little bit
like I'm being attacked.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.120
Well, I'm sorry, Joy.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.360
I'm sorry if that's how you feel,

29:48.440 --> 29:51.640
I'm sorry if that's how these
questions are making you feel.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.080
Okay?

30:03.880 --> 30:05.040
It's not my intention.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.280
And you're absolutely right, you are.

30:09.680 --> 30:14.120
Because, as you say, some of this is
territory we've already explored.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.160
The knock at the door, the inquest…

30:20.520 --> 30:23.480
but actually, Joy, this call,

30:23.560 --> 30:27.560
this final unanswered call…

30:30.920 --> 30:35.920
I'm not sure we ever did, as it happens,
get around to discussing it.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.640
You're right, I do have my notes
from last week

30:40.720 --> 30:43.280
and also from the end of last year,
as well, because, Joy--

30:43.360 --> 30:46.120
So what you're saying is
you think I didn't tell you?

30:46.920 --> 30:47.760
No.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.200
You think I deliberately…

30:49.880 --> 30:51.360
-No.
-You think I deliberately

30:51.440 --> 30:53.520
neglected or avoided--

30:53.600 --> 30:55.720
No, not at all. Far from it, in fact.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.680
Truth be told,

30:58.720 --> 31:03.440
I was worried that I might have missed it
or misunderstood, or...

31:04.880 --> 31:09.680
You see, all I'm after here, Joy,
is clarity.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.200
Because...

31:14.040 --> 31:16.200
I don't want you
repeating yourself either.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.320
Excuse me?

31:23.080 --> 31:27.360
I'm sorry if these questions
have been upsetting for you.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.120
Angela, they're not upsetting me.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.360
They're annoying me.
There's a difference.

31:44.880 --> 31:45.760
I'm sorry.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.720
What for?

31:52.240 --> 31:53.480
Getting pissed off.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.280
Not a problem.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.400
I'm not someone who withholds things.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.320
Agreed.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.760
So, I don't know.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.480
I mean, maybe I couldn't.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.160
-You know?
-Couldn't what?

32:22.800 --> 32:27.840
I mean, as opposed to not telling you,
not wanting to tell you...

32:32.160 --> 32:36.920
I mean, it's embarrassing... isn't it?

32:39.760 --> 32:41.000
It's <i>shameful.</i>

32:44.480 --> 32:46.640
I mean, it's my job, for Christ's sake.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.000
It's not as if I don't...

32:55.720 --> 32:57.160
think about it all--

33:02.680 --> 33:05.160
It's impossible not to, surely.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.080
You mean if you'd taken the call?

33:12.720 --> 33:16.000
You mean you think about
what you might have been able to do...

33:16.880 --> 33:19.080
had you accepted Joshua's call?

33:20.880 --> 33:22.280
Or maybe just listened.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.680
I mean, just listened.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.040
You know?

33:33.400 --> 33:34.360
Done my job.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.560
It's an awful feeling, isn't it?

33:45.760 --> 33:46.680
The feeling of...

33:48.080 --> 33:50.120
"If only I had said this or done that."

33:52.480 --> 33:57.840
You said it yourself in fact last week.
It's... the responsibility.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.160
No, that I...

34:04.200 --> 34:05.480
That I don't agree with.

34:06.120 --> 34:06.960
Okay.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.240
No, I like responsibility.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.600
Responsibility is good.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.880
I think we should be held accountable.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.440
It's a job.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.760
They ought to get under our skin.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.080
So that isn't what this is.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.160
I don't think.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.880
This is different.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.840
This is me not knowing
what to do because…

34:49.560 --> 34:50.680
or should have done...

34:52.760 --> 34:54.520
or really even why?

34:57.840 --> 35:00.320
I mean, how alone he must have felt.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.960
Really and truly. To do that...

35:09.320 --> 35:15.000
For him to feel that it was
a viable alternative...

35:15.080 --> 35:19.840
it just doesn't make sense.
I can't understand it, you know?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.760
I mean, what an idiot!

35:25.040 --> 35:26.560
What an honest to God--

35:28.040 --> 35:31.040
Is honestly sometimes how I feel about it.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.040
How it <i>feels, </i>you know?

35:38.040 --> 35:42.000
I mean, stop trying to make yourself
the center of your own misfortune.

35:43.320 --> 35:46.400
You have an amazing wife. She loves you.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.840
So... I don't know.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.920
Any of it.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.960
Why any of it?

36:37.440 --> 36:39.160
You've gone quiet again.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.520
So have you.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.280
What are you thinking about?

36:51.640 --> 36:53.120
What are <i>you </i>thinking about?

37:05.440 --> 37:06.480
Okay, well...

37:13.600 --> 37:14.720
I'm thinking about...

37:16.040 --> 37:17.960
my responsibility towards you.

37:20.800 --> 37:21.880
I'm thinking about...

37:23.280 --> 37:24.800
when it feels appropriate

37:24.880 --> 37:27.440
to push back on certain things
and when it doesn't.

37:29.640 --> 37:33.840
Well, perhaps I'm a little afraid,
to tell you the truth...

37:35.200 --> 37:36.600
of really taking you to task

37:36.680 --> 37:38.440
on one or two things you've said.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.920
Because I can see that you're upset...

37:45.360 --> 37:46.520
and you're vulnerable.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.960
But I can also see that you're stuck.

37:55.960 --> 37:56.840
And...

37:58.640 --> 38:01.280
then I suppose I'm thinking also about

38:01.360 --> 38:05.480
certain words and phrases
which seem to keep cropping up.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.280
Popping up again and again.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.600
Um...

38:10.720 --> 38:11.760
Control.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.920
Organized.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.360
Responsibility.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.880
Meaning.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.560
Feeling.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.480
Fuss.

38:25.000 --> 38:25.920
And of course...

38:28.320 --> 38:30.240
I would be lying if I said that I...

38:31.800 --> 38:33.880
I wasn't thinking about how...

38:35.880 --> 38:39.680
desperately, desperately unfair,

38:39.760 --> 38:42.760
and incomprehensible and...

38:43.720 --> 38:46.840
unbearable death is.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.480
How it changes everything.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.560
And yet, all the while,

38:54.200 --> 38:58.800
changing absolutely nothing
whatsoever at all.

39:02.360 --> 39:03.240
How...

39:04.920 --> 39:07.200
really, truly shit that is.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.560
How... really, truly shit

39:14.120 --> 39:16.520
grief can make us feel, Joy.

39:20.760 --> 39:24.400
And then if I think back
to the start of our conversation,

39:25.320 --> 39:28.080
how you coped with
the unintelligibility of the world

39:28.720 --> 39:30.440
after the death of your mother.

39:32.160 --> 39:35.520
How you took back
some level of control by, in a way,

39:35.600 --> 39:38.360
making or creating problems
for yourself elsewhere.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.520
And then...

39:42.800 --> 39:44.000
Take a moment...

39:44.160 --> 39:47.320
Wait a minute, I don't understand.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.280
Okay.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.240
You're not being clear.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.040
Okay.

39:59.600 --> 40:05.040
Well, I suppose it's interesting to me,
Joy, that when you and Alan first met

40:05.600 --> 40:10.840
and you were still in a relationship with
Lawrence, you didn't behave disruptively.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.520
You behaved, as it were,
perfectly honorably.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.840
And then, in the wake
of your mother's death,

40:18.600 --> 40:22.080
you decided, for whatever reason,
to keep your current partner at bay,

40:23.120 --> 40:24.040
away.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.160
A man you yourself--

40:26.240 --> 40:27.120
So what?

40:29.280 --> 40:30.320
I don't...

40:32.080 --> 40:33.680
I mean, so fucking what?

40:35.640 --> 40:36.920
I did a stupid thing.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.520
I mean...

40:41.120 --> 40:42.840
Jesus, I mean, I was upset.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.520
I was a child.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.480
I wasn't suggesting it was stupid, Joy.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.760
Quite the opposite, in fact.

40:52.320 --> 40:57.120
Because, of course, a problem over here
is a good thing.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.360
Because having a problem over here

41:00.440 --> 41:03.600
means not thinking, not having to think
about or deal with

41:03.680 --> 41:07.520
this great big other sinkhole
of a problem over here.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.680
It means control,

41:12.320 --> 41:15.800
responsibility, accountability, autonomy.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.840
But in order to have that...

41:21.080 --> 41:24.200
it means having to wreak havoc elsewhere,
do you see?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.720
All the way over here.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.160
Exploiting a catastrophe

41:33.000 --> 41:35.720
in order to block internal change.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.920
And when I think
about your current situation,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.520
thinking about things
as they currently stand...

41:43.400 --> 41:45.440
thinking back to where it all started...

41:46.240 --> 41:48.960
Inviting a relative stranger...

41:50.680 --> 41:52.600
into your consulting room, do you see?

41:53.560 --> 42:00.080
Designing and implementing
an elaborate... an arrangement

42:00.160 --> 42:06.200
which means-- or allows this antithetical
behavior to continue and to escalate--

42:06.800 --> 42:08.880
And when I say--
To be absolutely clear...

42:10.760 --> 42:14.080
what I am not talking about here is--

42:16.960 --> 42:18.800
But what I am talking about...

42:21.280 --> 42:22.400
is death.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.560
Is grief.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.600
Is feeling again. Something, anything.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Sex as a means of controlling...

42:33.680 --> 42:35.160
or neutralizing...

42:36.200 --> 42:37.120
No, but...

42:37.200 --> 42:42.320
An antithesis to a deep
and profound sense of loss.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.400
Wait, because...

42:47.480 --> 42:49.440
You said it yourself only a moment ago...

42:51.280 --> 42:56.720
Stop trying to place yourself
at the center of your own misfortune.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.760
Wow... Okay.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.280
Jesus.

43:11.440 --> 43:14.400
When I think about your relationship,

43:15.400 --> 43:16.960
as it currently stands...

43:18.360 --> 43:19.200
Okay?

43:22.400 --> 43:25.160
Here's what I understand to be the case.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.240
Joy?

43:33.200 --> 43:37.480
There was a very real loss of desire

43:37.960 --> 43:41.320
which you tackled, both of you, head on,

43:41.400 --> 43:44.240
with a series
of sanctioned infidelities...

43:46.720 --> 43:49.680
which led, in fact,
albeit counter-intuitively,

43:49.760 --> 43:52.480
but, nonetheless, extremely successfully,

43:53.040 --> 43:56.840
to a renewed sense of desire...

43:58.200 --> 44:00.640
excitement, intimacy.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.280
Does that seem like a fair
assessment of things?

44:09.080 --> 44:09.920
Joy?

44:14.200 --> 44:16.640
So my question to you, Joy...

44:18.480 --> 44:19.960
is why keep going?

44:21.120 --> 44:22.200
Do you see?

44:24.400 --> 44:25.800
Why not stop?

44:30.560 --> 44:31.960
Yes, I'm asking you.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.080
Because it's fun.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.200
Well, okay, so why keep going?

44:43.280 --> 44:46.720
Well, the answer is…
because it's working.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.080
And you're enjoying yourselves,
both of you.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.040
-Yeah.
-And why not? Good for you!

44:54.920 --> 44:55.760
But then...

44:58.360 --> 44:59.400
so why Lawrence?

45:02.680 --> 45:03.520
Joy?

45:05.440 --> 45:06.920
Why take that risk?

45:08.280 --> 45:10.040
With things at home never better,

45:10.520 --> 45:13.440
why persist in flirting with disaster?

45:16.560 --> 45:19.000
And why the situation
with your eldest daughter?

45:20.720 --> 45:22.080
Why not tell her the truth?

45:22.600 --> 45:23.800
Set the record straight?

45:27.760 --> 45:30.160
And then why this standing up in public,
Joy?

45:31.920 --> 45:33.920
In front of friends and colleagues?

45:37.160 --> 45:38.040
Do you see?

45:40.120 --> 45:43.640
Leapfrogging from this crisis
to that crisis.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.280
It's all too much.

45:52.600 --> 45:53.560
You...

45:55.880 --> 45:57.640
are not responsible...

45:58.920 --> 46:00.600
for that man.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.600
For what it was he did to himself.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.320
Joy...

46:08.760 --> 46:11.400
you simply are not.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.400
[Joy weeping]

46:22.520 --> 46:25.760
[Joy sobbing]

46:32.400 --> 46:33.360
Oh, fuck.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.680
-It's all right.
-No, I'm sorry.

46:36.080 --> 46:36.960
Don't be.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.120
[rumble of approaching train]

46:55.640 --> 46:56.600
I just...

47:01.720 --> 47:03.480
I feel so sorry for him.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.000
Not to mention Emily, I mean.

47:11.520 --> 47:12.760
[car horn blares]

47:14.840 --> 47:15.680
Well...

47:22.080 --> 47:23.240
feeling is good.

47:32.920 --> 47:33.760
And...

47:36.600 --> 47:40.800
feeling even more... is even better.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.720
These aren't feelings to run away from.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.440
Okay?

47:57.720 --> 47:59.160
Fuck, I'm sorry.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.240
Joy, I want you to stop apologizing.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.680
Sorry, I just…

48:12.320 --> 48:16.320
I don't really think
I have anything else to say.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.920
I mean, fuck, no. I'm not sorry at all.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.720
Maybe we can just sit here...

48:37.800 --> 48:39.080
for a little bit.

48:43.560 --> 48:44.400
Maybe…

48:48.920 --> 48:49.840
And then--

48:57.200 --> 48:58.120
Yeah.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.800
Maybe then--

49:30.280 --> 49:31.880
Before we finish...

49:34.720 --> 49:36.800
can I ask you what you're thinking about?

49:42.480 --> 49:44.520
Alan. Alan, I think.

49:49.560 --> 49:51.040
What I should do now.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.360
Whether to do anything or...

50:04.640 --> 50:05.840
whether it's too late...

50:32.800 --> 50:34.120
[sighs deeply]

51:09.480 --> 51:10.480
See you next week?

52:28.720 --> 52:30.160
[baby crying]

53:10.440 --> 53:14.160
[door opens, then closes]

54:28.240 --> 54:29.080
[Alan] Hi.

54:36.440 --> 54:37.280
Hi.
