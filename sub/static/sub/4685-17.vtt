What do you have

against my locker?

Apparently, my nose.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.472
This is for you,

02:22.184 --> 02:24.020
- You wanna go
- grab some lunch?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.563
I'm tight with the lunch lady,

02:25.564 --> 02:26.981
so I can get us milk

02:24.144 --> 02:26.981
that hasn't expired.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.983
- (GASPS)
- That would be great.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.109
I am so tired

02:30.110 --> 02:31.110

you can call me

02:42.204 --> 02:43.227
I'd rather keep

02:43.228 --> 02:44.248
calling you butt-head.

- (CHUCKLES)
- That's timeless.

02:51.881 --> 02:52.924
You know, Zuri,

02:52.925 --> 02:53.966
I think it's great that

02:54.092 --> 02:55.656
for your "Going Green"

02:55.657 --> 02:57.219
school project,

02:54.092 --> 02:57.219
you're planting a tree.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.055
Most of my class

02:59.056 --> 03:00.765
is just taking

02:57.344 --> 03:00.765
shorter showers.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.225
Which is a bad move

03:02.226 --> 03:03.559
for the stinkier kids.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.605
Hey! Maybe I'll name

03:07.606 --> 03:09.565
my tree after you.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.026
Oh, that's so sweet.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.257
My dad named

03:13.258 --> 03:14.361
an urban assault

03:12.151 --> 03:14.361
vehicle after me.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.886
- Yeah, one night,
- he lost control

03:15.947 --> 03:16.948
And crashed "Jessie"

03:16.949 --> 03:17.949
through a grocery store.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.451
If your dad

03:20.452 --> 03:21.535
ever comes to visit,

03:21.660 --> 03:22.808
remind me to wear

03:22.809 --> 03:23.955
my bullet-proof tutu.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.088
- You don't have
- to pay for lunch?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.631
Nah,

03:33.632 --> 03:35.049
Agnes owes me a favor.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.842

This is incredible.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.408
hot towels cover up

03:59.406 --> 04:01.408

04:03.661 --> 04:05.080
Look, Ravi.

04:05.081 --> 04:06.497
It is our sister, Emma.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.373
That we know and love.

04:10.168 --> 04:11.335
These your brothers?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.337
I wish I could say no.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.630
But I don't want to

04:14.631 --> 04:15.798
start our relationship

04:13.462 --> 04:15.798
off with lies.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.276
- Ravi K. Ross,
- pleased to meet you.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.760
Ah. Your hands

04:19.761 --> 04:21.220
are a little sweaty.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.930
No, that is saliva.

04:22.931 --> 04:24.515
I have been licking

04:21.345 --> 04:24.515
pudding off of them.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.060
Ah, you like pudding?

04:28.186 --> 04:30.042
Well, since I like

04:30.043 --> 04:31.897
your sister, maybe I can

04:28.186 --> 04:31.897
help you out with that.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.023
Pudding!

04:35.943 --> 04:37.569
- A king's ransom
- in pudding!

04:39.279 --> 04:40.302
And tell the ball monitor

04:40.303 --> 04:41.323
in the gym you know me.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.492
He'll give you

04:42.493 --> 04:43.534
the basketball

04:41.448 --> 04:43.534
that isn't lopsided.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.035
I thought those

04:45.036 --> 04:46.411
were just a myth.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.681
- You better be
- good to him!

04:47.705 --> 04:48.706
Very good.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.776
ZURI: What's that girl

04:55.777 --> 04:57.131
doing to Branchy?

04:57.256 --> 04:58.799
- I thought her name
- was Jessie!

04:58.924 --> 05:00.765
- Okay, I'll just pretend
- that doesn't sting.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.556
You put that

05:04.557 --> 05:06.891
staple into her,

05:02.220 --> 05:06.891
the next one goes into you.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.311
Oh, it's on!

05:14.314 --> 05:15.399
You could have

05:15.400 --> 05:16.483
won the tractor pull

05:14.314 --> 05:16.483
at our county fair.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.408
So, Emma took my advice

05:24.409 --> 05:26.326
and tonight, she has

05:22.489 --> 05:26.326
her very first date!

05:26.451 --> 05:27.703
I'll alert the media.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.624
Hey, a girl's

05:31.625 --> 05:33.209
first date is magical.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.107
Unless you take

05:35.108 --> 05:36.879
a shortcut to the Cineplex

05:33.333 --> 05:36.879
through an artillery range.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.645
- I still have a ringing
- in my left ear.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.236
- I don't know
- what's more surprising,

05:42.260 --> 05:44.101
- That you're - still single,
- Or still alive.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.700
- So, what do you
- think Vincent's like?

05:48.724 --> 05:49.934
An intellectual, uh,

05:49.935 --> 05:51.143
an athlete, a poet?

05:51.269 --> 05:53.187
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

05:54.563 --> 05:56.378
Hey, there, Red.

05:56.379 --> 05:58.192
You must be the warden.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.632
I'm going with

05:59.633 --> 06:00.945
"none of the above."

06:01.070 --> 06:02.259
Wanna pat me down?

06:02.260 --> 06:03.447
Could be the highlight

06:01.070 --> 06:03.447
of your week.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.286
Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Vincent.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.808
Aren't you making

06:09.809 --> 06:11.205
a great first impression.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.562
What do you do

06:13.563 --> 06:15.793
for a second one,

06:11.330 --> 06:15.793
club a baby seal?

06:15.918 --> 06:17.587
Hey, Vincent. We set up

06:17.588 --> 06:19.255
the screening room for

06:15.918 --> 06:19.255
your "evening with Emma."

06:19.379 --> 06:21.174
Ah. Thanks, guys.

06:21.175 --> 06:22.967
Here's some bathroom

06:19.379 --> 06:22.967
passes for your trouble.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.844
Awesome! Now even

06:24.845 --> 06:26.595
when I don't gotta go,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.013
I can still go!

06:28.306 --> 06:30.204
Wait. These are

06:30.205 --> 06:32.101
for the girls' room.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.227
You're welcome.

06:35.854 --> 06:36.605
Emma, Vincent's here!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.337
He seems like

06:38.338 --> 06:39.942
a swell guy!

06:40.651 --> 06:42.945
Hi, Vincent.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.593
Whoa! You look

06:44.594 --> 06:46.115
like you just washed up

06:43.070 --> 06:46.115
on the Jersey Shore!

06:47.908 --> 06:49.785
- I think she
- looks smokin'.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.162
Thanks, babe.

06:51.287 --> 06:52.643
Uh, babe?

06:52.644 --> 06:53.998
Nobody should be

06:51.287 --> 06:53.998
calling anybody "babe."

06:54.123 --> 06:55.833
Well, calm down, babe.

06:58.336 --> 07:01.213
Not helping, Luke.

07:01.339 --> 07:02.402
Why don't you and Ravi

07:02.403 --> 07:03.465
go show Vincent

07:01.339 --> 07:03.465
the screening room?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.111
- Make sure he
- doesn't steal anything.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.766
- Emma. Maybe you
- should go change.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.623
Oh, please. Like I'd

07:14.624 --> 07:16.354
take fashion advice from

07:12.891 --> 07:16.354
someone who owns skorts.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.688
(GASPS)

07:19.648 --> 07:21.338
It's the comfort of shorts

07:21.339 --> 07:23.027
in the style of a skirt.

07:23.152 --> 07:24.903
- And it keeps
- cheerleaders modest.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.558
Hey, guys,

07:32.559 --> 07:33.996
hope I'm not

07:31.118 --> 07:33.996
interrupting anything.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.728
I just baked

07:35.729 --> 07:37.333
some "everybody keep your

07:34.121 --> 07:37.333
hands to yourself" cookies.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.188
Jessie! We're trying

07:39.189 --> 07:40.919
to watch a movie.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.297
Movie's up there.

07:42.298 --> 07:43.547
And I'll be out there.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.343
So where was I?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.844
- Oh, yeah.
- So I tell the guy,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.888
- "Quit being such a baby.
- Blood washes out."

07:51.013 --> 07:53.807
All righty. (CHUCKLES)

07:53.932 --> 07:54.975
This night is over.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.144
It's past your curfew.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.270
But I'm already home.

07:58.396 --> 07:59.771
Then it's past your curfew.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.357
I don't have a curfew.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.649
Then, I just gave you one.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.817
Consider it a parting gift.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.782
Whoa, Jessie,

08:10.908 --> 08:12.305
maybe if you

08:12.306 --> 08:13.702
had your own man,

08:10.908 --> 08:13.702
you wouldn't be so uptight.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.246
I am this close to

08:15.247 --> 08:16.663
poking out your eye.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.666
And for your information,

08:19.791 --> 08:21.543
- I'm this tense
- even when I am dating.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.004
Go. Go.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.905
This is so unfair!

08:27.906 --> 08:29.593
Vincent is a great guy.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.220
He got me a new locker,

08:31.221 --> 08:32.721
far away from

08:29.718 --> 08:32.721
the boys' bathroom.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.700
- No, that's how
- these guys work, okay?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.058
They romance you with

08:42.982 --> 08:44.566
he's a bad influence.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.932
- Vincent is the best thing
- that's ever happened to me!

08:49.405 --> 08:51.156
- Well, that's what
- I said about skorts.

08:51.282 --> 08:53.075
- Clearly, we both
- have poor judgment!

08:55.744 --> 08:56.536
- What do you
- think you're doing?

08:56.661 --> 08:58.122
- I'm sleeping
- on the terrace,

08:58.247 --> 08:59.894
So I can use

08:59.895 --> 09:01.541
the telescope to keep

08:58.247 --> 09:01.541
an eye on Branchy.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.751
Oh, not gonna happen, Zuri.

09:02.752 --> 09:03.835
But I just wanna...

09:03.961 --> 09:05.880
No! You are gonna sleep

09:05.881 --> 09:07.798
in that bed if I have to

09:03.961 --> 09:07.798
staple the sheets down. Go.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.474

- in a bad mood, Emma!

09:15.222 --> 09:16.974
- I am not
- in a bad mood!

09:17.099 --> 09:18.496
Tell that to

09:18.497 --> 09:19.893

09:17.099 --> 09:19.893

09:23.688 --> 09:24.753

09:24.754 --> 09:25.816

- teeth whitened.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.113
This is serious.

- If I tell Emma she
- can't be with Vincent,

09:32.823 --> 09:35.143
- It's only going to - make her want to
- Be with him more.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.453

09:37.577 --> 09:38.577
Don't care.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.248
You're right!

09:41.373 --> 09:43.251
If I pretend I don't care,

09:43.252 --> 09:45.127
she'll realize for herself

09:41.373 --> 09:45.127
that Vincent is no good.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.420
No. I mean I don't care.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.937
Nothing.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.105

16:51.845 --> 16:53.179
(GASPS) Vincent!

16:54.598 --> 16:56.224
- And a bunch
- of other people.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.350
Who are really hungry.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.227
- Can you hook us up
- with some snacks?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.562
Sure.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.189
Luke, Ravi.

17:02.190 --> 17:03.690
Time for you to help me out.

17:03.815 --> 17:04.963
See, there's a guy here,

17:04.964 --> 17:06.108
and I need you two to

17:03.815 --> 17:06.108
teach him a lesson.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.590
Oh, if he needs a tutor,

17:07.592 --> 17:08.945
you got the wrong guy.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.593
See, my only

17:10.594 --> 17:12.115
good subject is recess.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.034
Whereas I am good

17:14.035 --> 17:15.827
at everything but recess.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.496
I mean,

17:17.497 --> 17:19.038
I need you to collect

17:15.953 --> 17:19.038
some money I'm owed.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.249
From that guy.

17:23.627 --> 17:24.712
Oh, dear.

17:24.713 --> 17:25.796
That is not a guy.

17:25.921 --> 17:27.027
That is a building

17:27.028 --> 17:28.131
in a hoodie.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.469
(BOTH MOANING)

17:37.724 --> 17:39.434
- Excuse me,
- Mr. Giant, sir.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.962
My associate wishes

17:45.963 --> 17:47.317
to speak to you.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.568
What?

17:55.492 --> 17:56.868
Now I know what

17:56.869 --> 17:58.244
Bertram's chair feels like.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.543
(GROANS)

18:05.669 --> 18:07.734
If you release us now,

18:07.735 --> 18:09.798
we will forgive you.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.592
But if you

18:11.593 --> 18:13.259
eat another bite

18:09.923 --> 18:13.259
of Bertram's bean dip,

18:13.384 --> 18:15.553
your colon will not.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.161
Emma! Em...

18:18.162 --> 18:19.808
What is going on here?

18:19.933 --> 18:21.227
(SNIFFS) Is someone

18:21.228 --> 18:22.519
eating my bean dip?

18:23.227 --> 18:24.521
Oh, hi, Ravi.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.023
Hello, Bertram!

18:27.065 --> 18:28.859
Turn the music down!

18:28.984 --> 18:30.610
What...

18:30.735 --> 18:34.031
Help! Help! Teens!

18:34.155 --> 18:35.198
So much acne!

18:37.951 --> 18:39.078
(FARTS)

18:39.079 --> 18:40.203
(GROANS)

18:40.996 --> 18:42.455
(CRIES)

18:43.581 --> 18:44.875
Vincent, this has

18:44.876 --> 18:46.167
gone too far!

18:46.292 --> 18:47.394
- Ravi is stuck
- in the piano,

18:47.418 --> 18:49.128
- Luke's being used
- as a seat cushion,

18:49.253 --> 18:49.880
- And Bertram
- was just swept away.

18:50.005 --> 18:53.383
And he hates sweeping!

18:54.592 --> 18:55.426
- You guys
- have to leave.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.699
And you

18:56.700 --> 18:57.846
need to chill out!

18:59.931 --> 19:01.204
(SCREAMING)

19:01.205 --> 19:02.475
Keep it moving, people.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.475
Nothing to see here.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.897
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

19:07.022 --> 19:07.898
- Fine.
- You win this round.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.399
And every round

19:09.400 --> 19:10.775
up until now.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.360
You've got that right.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.907
Hello? Emma?

19:17.032 --> 19:18.367
What's going on?

19:18.368 --> 19:19.701
I can barely hear you

19:17.032 --> 19:19.701
over that noise.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.827
What is that noise?

19:20.952 --> 19:23.371
It's a party!

19:23.496 --> 19:24.974
- Stop it! - That's an antique vase,
- Not a football!

19:24.998 --> 19:27.042
(SHATTERING)

19:27.166 --> 19:28.501
Jessie, come home!

19:28.502 --> 19:29.836
I need your help.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.505
I'll be right there!

19:31.506 --> 19:33.048
Come on, Zuri.

19:29.961 --> 19:33.048
Emma needs me.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.549
Well, Branchy needs me!

19:34.674 --> 19:36.885
(SCREAMING)

19:37.010 --> 19:38.429
Zuri, I gotta go.

19:38.430 --> 19:39.846
What's it gonna take?

19:42.974 --> 19:44.559
I can't wait

19:44.560 --> 19:46.144
to show Branchy

19:42.974 --> 19:46.144
her new home.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.734
Or what's left of it.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.179
- I think I'll start - by showing Branchy
- The panic room.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.324
Jessie, I'm so sorry.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.677
- You were right
- about Vincent.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.954
He's my T-Bob!

20:03.955 --> 20:06.205
And I don't want a T-Bob!

20:06.330 --> 20:08.291
- Nobody should have
- a T-Bob. I got this.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.296
Hey! This party is over!

20:13.421 --> 20:15.256
- Whoa, these are
- Emma's guests.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.988
You can't kick them out.

20:16.989 --> 20:18.593
You're just the help.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.987
- Don't you talk
- to Jessie that way!

20:20.011 --> 20:21.722
No, Emma. He's right,

20:21.723 --> 20:23.431
I am just the help.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.142
- So let me
- help you out.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.936
(GROANS)

20:28.061 --> 20:29.312
My dad taught me that move.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.960
And sharpshooting.

20:30.961 --> 20:32.482
You're lucky I'm not armed.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.609
Emma! You're gonna

20:34.610 --> 20:36.611
let her do this to me?

20:36.736 --> 20:37.800
You're right.

20:37.801 --> 20:38.863
She shouldn't do that.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.783
Ow!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.803
- All right, just keep - his wrist right
- Between the shoulder-blades.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.308
Good. Oh!

20:45.309 --> 20:46.788
Now I know how

20:43.827 --> 20:46.788
proud my dad felt.

20:46.913 --> 20:47.914
Everybody out.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.211
Jessie, I'm so sorry

20:52.212 --> 20:53.503
about all this.

20:53.628 --> 20:54.692
I totally volunteer

20:54.693 --> 20:55.755
to clean it all up.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.111
Aw, that's cute.

20:57.112 --> 20:58.341
You think you have a choice.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.261
Emma, are you okay?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.972
- I should've
- listened to you.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.203
Yeah. You could

21:05.204 --> 21:06.307
learn a lot from my

21:06.432 --> 21:08.894
many, many, many years

21:08.895 --> 21:11.354
of painful experience.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.730
- You've had
- a rough 18 years.

21:12.856 --> 21:13.982
The womb wasn't

21:13.983 --> 21:15.108
that great either.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.609
- My mom ate
- a lot of jalapenos.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.717
Just remember,

21:19.718 --> 21:21.114
I'm here to help you.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.470
Great. Can you

21:22.471 --> 21:23.700
help me get Ravi out?

21:25.869 --> 21:26.891
Believe it or not,

21:26.892 --> 21:27.912
I was once in

21:25.869 --> 21:27.912
a very similar situation.

21:28.038 --> 21:29.393
T-Bob didn't want

21:29.394 --> 21:30.748
to pay for Cowboys tickets.

21:30.874 --> 21:31.979
I knew I shouldn't

21:31.980 --> 21:33.084
have followed him

21:30.874 --> 21:33.084
into that sewage pipe.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.544
I took 10 showers...

21:34.669 --> 21:36.192
You know what would

21:36.193 --> 21:37.714
make this story

21:34.669 --> 21:37.714
more enjoyable?

21:37.839 --> 21:39.966
If I did not have

21:39.967 --> 21:42.093
a piano string where

21:37.839 --> 21:42.093
the sun does not shine.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.037
How'd you get

21:48.038 --> 21:49.184
in that piano, anyway?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.909
- I have chosen to
- suppress the memory.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.481
- I've just changed
- my status to single.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.296
I'm a free woman

21:57.297 --> 21:58.985
and ready to par-tay.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.612
You're a grounded woman

22:00.613 --> 22:02.113
and ready to stu-day.

22:03.698 --> 22:04.866
You know,

22:04.867 --> 22:06.034
losing Vincent

22:03.698 --> 22:06.034
isn't that bad.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.286
I was using so many

22:07.287 --> 22:08.411
of those bathroom passes,

22:08.536 --> 22:09.933
people were

22:09.934 --> 22:11.330
calling me "Leaky Luke."

22:11.455 --> 22:12.874
(BANGING)

22:12.875 --> 22:14.292
BERTRAM: Help! Help!

22:14.417 --> 22:15.459
- (SOBBING)
- Someone help.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.176
- Bertram? - How did you
- Get in there?

22:23.301 --> 22:27.264
Teens! So much acne!

22:27.388 --> 22:28.588
- I just couldn't
- fight back!

22:31.642 --> 22:33.416
And the last stop

22:33.417 --> 22:35.188
on our tour is the kitchen.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.565
ALL: Pull!

22:40.777 --> 22:42.132
Branchy,

22:42.133 --> 22:43.487
I am so sorry

22:40.777 --> 22:43.487
you had to see that.
