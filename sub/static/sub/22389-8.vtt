â™ª â™ª

00:21.000 --> 00:22.699
[cheers and applause]

00:22.699 --> 00:24.399
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater

00:24.399 --> 00:25.769
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:25.769 --> 00:29.629
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:29.629 --> 00:32.630
[cheers and applause]

00:32.630 --> 00:38.369
â™ª â™ª

00:41.299 --> 00:43.700
- Welcome to "Penn & Teller:
Fool Us."

00:43.700 --> 00:45.969
Tonight, you're gonna see
magicians do some tricks

00:45.969 --> 00:47.369
that will probably fool you,

00:47.369 --> 00:49.570
and they'll certainly fool me.

00:49.570 --> 00:51.030
But that doesn't matter.

00:51.030 --> 00:54.130
They're trying to fool
two of the greatest magicians

00:54.130 --> 00:56.600
of all time: Penn and Teller.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.429
If they succeed, they'll win
the priceless prize

00:59.429 --> 01:01.170
of performing with our boys

01:01.170 --> 01:03.530
as part of their Las Vegas show.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.328
We can't wait to do the show,

01:05.328 --> 01:07.599
so--we can't do it without them,

01:07.599 --> 01:11.000
so let's hear it
for Penn and Teller.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
[cheers and applause]

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Hi.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.500
â™ª â™ª

01:19.500 --> 01:21.269
- Everybody okay?
- All right.

01:21.269 --> 01:22.400
Take your seats.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.900
You got good ones tonight.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.900
[cheers and applause]

01:33.030 --> 01:34.930
All right.
Fasten your seat belts.

01:34.930 --> 01:37.170
Let's meet our first performer.

01:39.069 --> 01:40.229
- Hi, I'm Matthew Laslo,

01:40.229 --> 01:44.000
and I'm a 15-year-old magician.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.469
I started magic
when I was seven years old.

01:47.469 --> 01:49.969
I run the projector
at this beautiful theater

01:49.969 --> 01:51.930
on Orcas Island, where I live,

01:51.930 --> 01:55.030
so I get to use the venue
for my performances,

01:55.030 --> 01:56.870
which is just incredible.

01:56.870 --> 01:57.870
[cheers and applause]

01:57.870 --> 01:59.329
[dramatic music]

01:59.329 --> 02:02.500
There are some differences
between my generation

02:02.500 --> 02:05.500
of magician
and the older generation.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.930
Youth is a big part of my show.

02:06.930 --> 02:08.969
I enter on a hoverboard.

02:08.969 --> 02:11.300
I use stuff like selfie sticks

02:11.300 --> 02:13.000
and instantly,
when you see that,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.469
there's such an amazing energy
from the audience

02:15.469 --> 02:16.670
that I just feed off of.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.270
â™ª â™ª

02:18.270 --> 02:20.329
I try and create
a modern world,

02:20.329 --> 02:22.569
a current, fresh approach
to magic.

02:22.569 --> 02:24.800
â™ª â™ª

02:24.800 --> 02:26.599
This is what magic
looks like right now.

02:26.599 --> 02:28.229
â™ª â™ª

02:28.229 --> 02:32.030
[cheers and applause]

02:32.030 --> 02:36.229
- Please welcome 15-year-old
magician Matthew Laslo.

02:36.229 --> 02:39.229
[cheers and applause]

02:39.229 --> 02:42.229
[upbeat rock music]

02:42.229 --> 02:48.370
â™ª â™ª

02:48.370 --> 02:50.670
- Hi, everyone.
My name is Matthew Laslo.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.099
Penn and Teller,
thank you so much

02:53.099 --> 02:54.729
for having me on your show.

02:54.729 --> 02:57.430
Right now, it's time for fun...

02:57.430 --> 03:00.500
[dramatic music]

03:00.500 --> 03:01.699
â™ª â™ª

03:01.699 --> 03:03.199
With a T-shirt gun.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.330
Whoa!

03:04.330 --> 03:06.069
Little itchy trigger finger.

03:06.069 --> 03:08.830
Sorry about that.
Hope I didn't hit anybody.

03:08.830 --> 03:12.800
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
my assistant, Maria.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.800
[cheers and applause]

03:18.930 --> 03:20.800
Maria, time to reload.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.870
- Reload.
- T-shirt.

03:21.870 --> 03:22.870
- T-shirt.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.400
- Ramrod.
- Ramrod.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.969
- Who wants a T-shirt?

03:25.969 --> 03:27.599
Come on.
Who wants it?

03:27.599 --> 03:29.030
Let's see.

03:29.030 --> 03:31.430
There we go.

03:31.430 --> 03:34.629
These things are so much fun,

03:34.629 --> 03:37.969
and the cool thing is
they can shoot other stuff

03:37.969 --> 03:40.430
like candy, confetti,

03:40.430 --> 03:42.729
even playing cards.

03:42.729 --> 03:44.129
Let's try something fun

03:44.129 --> 03:47.770
with this deck of cards
and the T-shirt gun.

03:47.770 --> 03:52.500
â™ª â™ª

03:52.500 --> 03:54.329
But first a word of caution.

03:54.329 --> 03:56.800
Like all guns,
these can be very dangerous.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.729
So please do not try what
I'm about to attempt at home.

04:00.729 --> 04:02.129
Go to your friend's house.

04:02.129 --> 04:03.169
[laughter]

04:03.169 --> 04:04.870
Just kidding.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.030
I'm going to need
the help of a few people

04:07.030 --> 04:09.830
from the audience,

04:09.830 --> 04:12.770
starting off over here.

04:12.770 --> 04:13.770
How about you?

04:13.770 --> 04:15.900
Go ahead and touch any card,

04:15.900 --> 04:17.970
any card at all.

04:17.970 --> 04:19.029
Right there?

04:19.029 --> 04:21.029
Look at that card.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.430
Remember it and hold onto it.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.000
Over here, touch any card,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.399
any card at all.

04:28.399 --> 04:29.399
Right there?

04:29.399 --> 04:30.569
Look at that card,

04:30.569 --> 04:33.329
remember it,
and hold onto it.

04:33.329 --> 04:35.300
Now, over here.

04:35.300 --> 04:38.129
Touch any card,
any card at all.

04:38.129 --> 04:40.100
Any one.
Right there?

04:40.100 --> 04:43.029
Now--oops.
You know what?

04:43.029 --> 04:45.069
We'll do something special
for your card.

04:45.069 --> 04:49.670
I'm going to tear the corner

04:49.670 --> 04:52.500
off of your card,

04:52.500 --> 04:55.029
and you get
to keep that piece

04:55.029 --> 04:57.500
as a souvenir.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.769
Three random people

05:00.769 --> 05:04.199
and three freely-chosen cards.

05:04.199 --> 05:05.699
Remember those cards.

05:05.699 --> 05:07.870
Hopefully we'll see them again.

05:09.269 --> 05:11.670
Now, over the years,

05:11.670 --> 05:13.430
a few brave magicians

05:13.430 --> 05:16.129
have attempted a feat
called the Bullet Catch:

05:16.129 --> 05:19.470
catching a bullet fired
from a gun in their teeth.

05:19.470 --> 05:22.029
Penn and Teller
made the trick famous

05:22.029 --> 05:25.199
while other magicians
have ended up in the hospital

05:25.199 --> 05:26.699
or worse.

05:26.699 --> 05:30.699
Tonight, I'm going to try my own
slightly-less-dangerous version

05:30.699 --> 05:32.029
of the Bullet Catch

05:32.029 --> 05:34.370
with the T-shirt gun.

05:34.370 --> 05:38.470
â™ª â™ª

05:38.470 --> 05:42.329
To start, I am loading
this rag into the gun

05:42.329 --> 05:46.329
to keep the blast
from blowing the cards to bits.

05:46.329 --> 05:51.730
Next, the deck of cards
with the three chosen cards.

05:51.730 --> 05:55.129
In a few moments, Maria will aim
the gun at my face

05:55.129 --> 05:56.699
and pull the trigger.

05:56.699 --> 05:59.529
If things go well, I will catch
the three chosen cards

05:59.529 --> 06:01.300
in my mouth.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.699
If things go horribly wrong,

06:03.699 --> 06:05.370
I could end up

06:05.370 --> 06:07.800
with some pretty nasty
paper cuts.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.199
[laughter]

06:09.199 --> 06:10.370
Oh, yeah.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.370
Now, to further continue,

06:13.370 --> 06:16.470
Maria is going to stuff
a poly-cotton blend

06:16.470 --> 06:20.529
Magic Now T-shirt
into the gun as well.

06:20.529 --> 06:22.069
â™ª â™ª

06:22.069 --> 06:24.670
Once again,
please do not try this at home.

06:24.670 --> 06:27.699
When the gun goes off, the cards
will be flying at my face

06:27.699 --> 06:30.000
at almost 200 miles an hour.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.269
So my mom told me
to wear these safety glasses.

06:33.269 --> 06:34.430
â™ª â™ª

06:34.430 --> 06:36.769
So this is for you, Mom.

06:36.769 --> 06:39.129
[laughter]

06:39.129 --> 06:40.930
Maria, take your position.

06:40.930 --> 06:44.829
Let's do this
on the count of three.

06:44.829 --> 06:47.670
One,

06:47.670 --> 06:48.670
two...

06:48.670 --> 06:49.670
whoa!

06:49.670 --> 06:51.430
Three.

06:51.430 --> 06:53.399
What happened to on three?

06:53.399 --> 06:55.470
You missed my count.

06:55.470 --> 06:57.800
What?
Wait a second.

06:57.800 --> 07:02.569
I caught three cards
on the T-shirt.

07:02.569 --> 07:05.329
I even caught the T-shirt.

07:05.329 --> 07:08.870
[applause]

07:08.870 --> 07:12.600
But are they the right cards?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.600
Starting off here,
what card did you pick?

07:15.600 --> 07:19.269
- Three of hearts.
- The three of hearts.

07:19.269 --> 07:21.629
The three of hearts.

07:21.629 --> 07:24.629
[applause]

07:25.930 --> 07:28.829
And the gentleman right beside
you--what card did you pick?

07:28.829 --> 07:31.000
- Ten of clubs.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.500
- The ten of clubs.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.500
[applause]

07:37.670 --> 07:39.800
Oh, and the lady
with the torn piece--

07:39.800 --> 07:41.129
can you
bring that up here?

07:41.129 --> 07:43.500
Let's make some noise as
she makes her way to the stage.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.970
[cheers and applause]

07:45.970 --> 07:46.970
Hi.
- Hi.

07:46.970 --> 07:48.170
- What's your name?
- Tina.

07:48.170 --> 07:51.069
- Tina, now, is that your card,
the five of spades?

07:51.069 --> 07:52.329
- Yes.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.970
- Go ahead and remove your card
from my shirt first.

07:54.970 --> 07:55.970
Let's--
- Oh.

07:55.970 --> 07:57.069
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

07:57.069 --> 07:58.500
- What's wrong?
- I can't.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.529
- What?

08:00.529 --> 08:05.269
Your card is embedded
into the fibers of my T-shirt.

08:05.269 --> 08:06.399
- Wow.

08:06.399 --> 08:08.500
- But there's a corner missing.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.699
If that piece fits,
that would be amazing.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.170
- It--
- Let's see.

08:14.170 --> 08:16.470
A perfect match.

08:16.470 --> 08:19.069
[cheers and applause]

08:19.069 --> 08:22.269
I'll take the card.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.769
You get the torn piece,
along with all of this applause.

08:25.769 --> 08:26.870
You can go back
to your seat.

08:26.870 --> 08:27.870
A huge round of applause.

08:27.870 --> 08:30.800
- That was Matthew Laslo!

08:30.800 --> 08:32.830
That was awesome.
- Thank you.

08:32.830 --> 08:34.399
- Wow.

08:34.399 --> 08:36.330
Do you practice, like,
every single day?

08:36.330 --> 08:38.899
- Yeah, I practice a lot.
Like, it's a constant thing.

08:38.899 --> 08:40.600
You always carry around
a deck of cards

08:40.600 --> 08:42.370
and are messing around
with everything

08:42.370 --> 08:43.370
that you can, you know?

08:43.370 --> 08:44.429
- Oh.

08:44.429 --> 08:45.929
So what's the sort
of worst thing

08:45.929 --> 08:47.399
that's happened to you
during a show?

08:47.399 --> 08:49.899
- Worst thing that happened--
well, I was doing a trick

08:49.899 --> 08:52.230
where my clothing
was the prediction

08:52.230 --> 08:53.669
for the end of the trick,

08:53.669 --> 08:56.100
and I was wearing shorts
underneath my pants,

08:56.100 --> 08:58.029
and I had to take
my pants off for this,

08:58.029 --> 09:01.299
and I was performing for
about 200 people in a church.

09:01.299 --> 09:02.629
So I took my pants off.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.970
The shorts came with it,

09:03.970 --> 09:06.000
and I was stepping forward
for the big applause cue,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.070
and it was--for an 11-year-old,
it was quite embarrassing.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.129
- Oh, dear.

09:10.129 --> 09:11.830
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.730
And what's your ultimate goal?

09:13.730 --> 09:15.899
- To have my own show
somewhere in the world.

09:15.899 --> 09:18.529
Like a nightly show, like, maybe
in--maybe even Las Vegas, here.

09:18.529 --> 09:19.570
- Yeah.

09:19.570 --> 09:20.870
- So this is a dream
come true to be here.

09:20.870 --> 09:22.399
- So are you nervous?

09:22.399 --> 09:24.230
'Cause you don't seem nervous
at all, but this, I think,

09:24.230 --> 09:25.529
is your first time
on television, correct?

09:25.529 --> 09:27.500
- I'm--yes, this is
the first time on television.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.769
I was extremely nervous
going into it.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.600
Like, my legs were shaking
at the beginning.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.299
But this is--you know,
once you're out here

09:33.299 --> 09:34.529
for a little bit,
you--you know,

09:34.529 --> 09:35.929
you guys were
such an awesome audience,

09:35.929 --> 09:37.000
so it's just been--been great.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.669
- Aww.

09:38.669 --> 09:40.570
[cheers and applause]

09:40.570 --> 09:42.769
Well, you didn't seem nervous
at all.

09:42.769 --> 09:44.370
- Thank you.
- Yeah. All right.

09:44.370 --> 09:46.500
Well, let's go
to the boys, shall we?

09:46.500 --> 09:47.799
- All right.
Yes.

09:47.799 --> 09:49.529
- Boys?

09:49.529 --> 09:52.200
- Well, we're doing a lot
of thinking on this.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.330
We do not think,

09:54.330 --> 09:56.399
in the history of our show,

09:56.399 --> 09:57.970
there has been
a better entrance.

09:57.970 --> 09:59.669
No, there's not been
a better entrance.

09:59.669 --> 10:00.899
- Thank you.

10:00.899 --> 10:03.899
[cheers and applause]

10:03.899 --> 10:07.070
- Age-appropriate entrance,
age-appropriate props.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.399
Very good idea.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.529
It's really wonderful
how you've taken stuff

10:10.529 --> 10:13.629
from a lot of different sources
and put it together.

10:13.629 --> 10:16.929
You've culled things from
all sorts of ways

10:16.929 --> 10:18.299
people have done magic.

10:18.299 --> 10:21.570
The color-changing T-shirt
is something we've seen before.

10:21.570 --> 10:23.570
The torn corner is something
we've seen before,

10:23.570 --> 10:26.000
but never seen a torn corner
on a T-shirt.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
It makes it
an entirely new trick,

10:28.000 --> 10:29.700
even though we know
both parts of it.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.299
We just loved
how you went through

10:31.299 --> 10:32.330
and pulled things

10:32.330 --> 10:33.700
here and there
and put it together

10:33.700 --> 10:37.330
in a--in a whole new--
we've seen every piece of this.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.000
We never saw it all together,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.169
and that makes you
a great performer, I think.

10:41.169 --> 10:42.769
[cheers and applause]

10:42.769 --> 10:44.700
- Thank you.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.799
- So are you convinced
that they know how you--

10:46.799 --> 10:48.600
- They--yes.
Absolutely, they--

10:48.600 --> 10:50.070
- Did everything
even though--okay.

10:50.070 --> 10:51.629
- They're--thank you once again.

10:51.629 --> 10:53.399
- You were great, man.
This was great, Matthew, great.

10:53.399 --> 10:54.929
- This has been, like, the best
week of my life.

10:54.929 --> 10:56.570
- Aww.
- [laughs]

10:56.570 --> 10:59.100
- Well, thank you,
Matthew Laslo.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.070
You were so wonderful.
- Thank you, everyone.

11:01.070 --> 11:03.070
[cheers and applause]

11:03.070 --> 11:04.970
- We have more
potential foolers,

11:04.970 --> 11:07.830
plus a trick by Penn and Teller
later in the show.

11:07.830 --> 11:08.899
Stay close.

11:08.899 --> 11:11.899
[jazz music]

11:11.899 --> 11:14.629
â™ª â™ª

11:18.970 --> 11:21.970
[cheers and applause]

11:21.970 --> 11:24.700
[jazz music]

11:24.700 --> 11:25.769
- Welcome back.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.299
While you were
watching commercials,

11:27.299 --> 11:30.230
we went out and found
this next potential fooler.

11:32.799 --> 11:33.799
- I am Zabrecky.

11:33.799 --> 11:37.230
[dramatic electronic music]

11:37.230 --> 11:38.769
I guess it is true
that I've always been

11:38.769 --> 11:40.730
a little bit...

11:40.730 --> 11:42.529
different.

11:42.529 --> 11:44.169
I don't know
what people say about me,

11:44.169 --> 11:46.299
and I really don't care.

11:46.299 --> 11:48.070
[quirky music]

11:48.070 --> 11:50.600
I wouldn't really want anyone
to expect anything

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
from one of my performances,

11:52.600 --> 11:56.470
because the artist's job is to
always deepen the mystery.

11:56.470 --> 11:59.830
I don't know if I can convince
Penn and Teller of anything,

11:59.830 --> 12:01.200
but I'm gonna try.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.370
I'll show them
what I'm good at.

12:03.370 --> 12:04.629
I want them to like me.

12:04.629 --> 12:06.370
Penn and Teller,
do you like me?

12:06.370 --> 12:08.899
â™ª â™ª

12:08.899 --> 12:12.370
[cheers and applause]

12:12.370 --> 12:15.330
- And now, with four
randomly-selected members

12:15.330 --> 12:19.529
of our audience, here's
the very-specific Zabrecky.

12:19.529 --> 12:22.529
[cheers and applause]

12:23.529 --> 12:26.970
- Humans, by being here now,

12:26.970 --> 12:30.870
you'll be part of an event
that you will never forget.

12:30.870 --> 12:32.700
Go ahead and take the caps
off of these pens.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.730
Put them to the cardboard
and draw me a picture.

12:35.730 --> 12:37.169
You can draw anything
that you like.

12:37.169 --> 12:38.470
Start drawing right...

12:38.470 --> 12:39.799
[snaps]
Now.

12:39.799 --> 12:42.399
It could be something simple,
like a circle, a square,

12:42.399 --> 12:44.600
maybe a geometric shape,

12:44.600 --> 12:48.870
maybe something more complex--
a burning Christmas tree.

12:48.870 --> 12:50.730
[laughter]

12:50.730 --> 12:51.899
Oh, please finish up the work.

12:51.899 --> 12:54.600
Now, very carefully,
put the caps on the pens

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
and hand all of the drawings
down to your right,

12:56.600 --> 12:58.529
to the female standing
closest to the table

12:58.529 --> 12:59.929
on the far right over there.

12:59.929 --> 13:01.899
Please tell me when you have
those four drawings

13:01.899 --> 13:04.299
in your hand.

13:04.299 --> 13:05.399
You have the four drawings?
- Yes.

13:05.399 --> 13:06.529
- Good.

13:06.529 --> 13:07.769
Now, make sure
they're all facing down,

13:07.769 --> 13:09.769
so they're facing the stage,
and once they are,

13:09.769 --> 13:11.370
shuffle them up
so you don't know

13:11.370 --> 13:13.169
where your drawing is
with anyone else's.

13:13.169 --> 13:14.870
Just make sure
they're all mixed up

13:14.870 --> 13:16.470
and they're all facing down.

13:16.470 --> 13:17.570
That done?
- Mm-hmm.

13:17.570 --> 13:18.769
- Place them face-down
onto the table.

13:18.769 --> 13:20.769
I will collect the pens.

13:25.629 --> 13:29.169
[pens clattering]

13:29.169 --> 13:32.730
Ladies and gentlemen,
among my skill sets,

13:32.730 --> 13:37.529
I happen to be
an expert in art analysis,

13:37.529 --> 13:40.899
and I have a trained eye--
this one, right here--

13:40.899 --> 13:42.669
to read in between
the lines of fine artwork,

13:42.669 --> 13:45.169
in particular
of pen-and-ink drawings.

13:45.169 --> 13:46.970
So if I analyze
this work properly,

13:46.970 --> 13:49.100
I should be able
to determine not one,

13:49.100 --> 13:51.669
but two things.

13:51.669 --> 13:53.970
I should be able to tell
all of you people, number one,

13:53.970 --> 13:56.299
which artist
created which picture,

13:56.299 --> 13:58.529
and number two,
I should be able to reveal

13:58.529 --> 14:00.470
some personal information

14:00.470 --> 14:02.330
about each of my artists.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.100
[laughter]

14:04.100 --> 14:05.629
And I'm going
to judge you all.

14:05.629 --> 14:08.000
[laughter]

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Especially you.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.970
[laughter]

14:10.970 --> 14:13.830
Let's see what we have.
Four artists, four drawings.

14:13.830 --> 14:15.230
Well, I said draw anything.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.200
This is certainly anything.
Look at this.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.629
A beautiful rendition.

14:18.629 --> 14:20.799
A woman with a hat
and long hair

14:20.799 --> 14:22.269
just kind of floating
in space there.

14:22.269 --> 14:24.399
Can we see that?
I mean, the work is compulsive.

14:24.399 --> 14:25.799
It's concentrated,

14:25.799 --> 14:29.629
yet it tells me everything that
I need to know about my artist.

14:29.629 --> 14:31.899
So right here, a little heart,
right there on the hat.

14:31.899 --> 14:35.830
It tells me that the person
that composed this picture

14:35.830 --> 14:38.600
likes piÃ±a coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.429
[laughter]

14:41.500 --> 14:42.799
Your work, yes?
- Yeah.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.200
- Be gone.
Go.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.200
This way.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.429
Right over here.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.429
[applause]

14:50.429 --> 14:53.269
One down.
Let's see what we have next.

14:53.269 --> 14:55.200
Oh, of course.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.200
Clearly, the work
of a sex maniac.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.629
[laughter]

15:00.629 --> 15:04.169
A faceless stick figure.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.799
Pure subversion.

15:06.799 --> 15:08.600
Mm.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.370
Look at this.

15:10.370 --> 15:13.799
[laughter]

15:13.799 --> 15:15.929
Your work.
Be gone.

15:15.929 --> 15:17.000
Go.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.370
Also, go.
Good.

15:18.370 --> 15:20.399
Two artists, two pictures.

15:20.399 --> 15:22.070
Aren't you glad you volunteered?

15:22.070 --> 15:24.029
[laughter]

15:24.029 --> 15:26.500
Oh, my God.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.600
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
Move.

15:36.070 --> 15:38.970
Oh, my God.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.070
This is your work, isn't it?

15:40.070 --> 15:41.169
- Yes.
- Just go.

15:41.169 --> 15:43.070
Just go.
Go, go.

15:43.070 --> 15:46.070
[applause]

15:46.070 --> 15:47.830
[whispering]
He is so weird.

15:47.830 --> 15:49.230
[laughter]

15:49.230 --> 15:50.830
We have one artist.
We have one picture.

15:50.830 --> 15:52.230
You may take your seat back.

15:52.230 --> 15:54.200
We're gonna do something
a little bit different with you.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.200
Go on.
Take your seat back.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.669
Yes.
You can go back.

15:56.669 --> 15:58.600
You can applaud for her
as she does.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.070
[applause]

16:01.070 --> 16:03.299
Female, I would like you
to clear your mind

16:03.299 --> 16:04.629
of all of your thoughts

16:04.629 --> 16:06.700
and concentrate on the picture
you drew a moment ago.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.700
Do you recall
what you did compose?

16:08.700 --> 16:10.500
Yes?
Good.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.700
Let your mind be free.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.970
Concentrate on the picture
and send it to me,

16:13.970 --> 16:15.529
and I will draw the first thing

16:15.529 --> 16:17.399
that comes into my mind,
you see.

16:17.399 --> 16:18.500
You understand?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.769
So take the picture
from your brain

16:20.769 --> 16:25.070
and send it to me right here.

16:25.070 --> 16:28.070
[laughter]

16:31.470 --> 16:33.429
[sniffing]

16:33.429 --> 16:36.429
[laughter]

16:38.500 --> 16:41.399
There we go.

16:41.399 --> 16:44.870
[laughter]

16:44.870 --> 16:46.429
I'm not saying
this is what you composed.

16:46.429 --> 16:48.529
It's just the first thing
that came into my mind.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.529
[laughter]

16:57.399 --> 16:58.730
Once again,
let your mind be free.

16:58.730 --> 17:00.070
Concentrate on the picture.

17:00.070 --> 17:02.700
Send it to me now.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.700
Oh, yes.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.230
Something's happening.

17:06.230 --> 17:08.769
That's it.

17:08.769 --> 17:10.098
That's it.

17:10.098 --> 17:11.829
I've composed something here,

17:11.829 --> 17:15.170
as I have here.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.029
I can't change my mind.

17:17.029 --> 17:18.529
In a loud and clear voice,

17:18.529 --> 17:20.329
would you mind
telling everyone here tonight

17:20.329 --> 17:22.200
what you composed
just a moment ago

17:22.200 --> 17:23.299
on your slip of cardboard?

17:23.299 --> 17:24.799
Yes?
- A fish.

17:24.799 --> 17:25.799
- A fish.

17:25.799 --> 17:27.098
May we take a look?

17:27.098 --> 17:28.098
Can we take a look?

17:30.599 --> 17:34.299
Some would call this a fish.

17:34.299 --> 17:35.299
Some would.

17:35.299 --> 17:38.299
[laughter]

17:42.829 --> 17:44.700
It's very nicely drawn.

17:44.700 --> 17:48.500
It's just like the one
you sent me right here.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.500
[cheers and applause]

17:57.069 --> 17:58.700
- Wow.

17:58.700 --> 17:59.900
Hi, hello.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.829
- Who are you?
- Hi. Alyson.

18:02.829 --> 18:04.130
- Alyson.
Hi.

18:04.130 --> 18:06.299
What a coincidence.
My sister's name is Laura.

18:06.299 --> 18:07.470
- Okay.

18:07.470 --> 18:10.670
Nice to--
nice to meet you.

18:10.670 --> 18:14.130
Do you know those markers
might be a little toxic?

18:14.130 --> 18:16.329
And just--I'm a little worried
about your health.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.630
Here--just--yes.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.130
No, that's--okay.

18:20.130 --> 18:22.269
Well, it's just--
you have lovely cheekbones.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.670
- Well, thank you.
- Yes. All right.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.500
Okay, okay.
So maybe the guy--okay.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.299
[laughs nervously]

18:28.299 --> 18:32.000
How did you draw the fish?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
- Well, the fish
came to me, you see.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.299
- Right.

18:34.299 --> 18:36.170
- Because she composed it
and it was sent to me, you see.

18:36.170 --> 18:37.769
Just sort of flowed
through the theater here.

18:37.769 --> 18:40.069
- Right, but, I mean,
I wouldn't have--

18:40.069 --> 18:41.200
even if I was looking at it,

18:41.200 --> 18:42.500
I wouldn't have been
able to say,

18:42.500 --> 18:44.599
"Oh, that's a fish,"
and copy it.

18:44.599 --> 18:45.900
Like, you're really good.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.500
- That's why I'm here,
and you're over there.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
You see?
Yes, of course.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
- That's so true.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.329
So good.
- Yes.

18:51.329 --> 18:54.000
- Can you tell
what they're thinking?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
- I'm not sure
which one is which.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.529
[laughter]

18:58.529 --> 18:59.799
- Really?
Okay.

18:59.799 --> 19:02.869
Let's see if the boys
have it figured out.

19:02.869 --> 19:04.670
- God, you know,
I got to tell you

19:04.670 --> 19:06.470
how many magicians

19:06.470 --> 19:09.930
trying to be funny
have held pens in their hands,

19:09.930 --> 19:12.730
and no one was smart enough
to write on their face.

19:12.730 --> 19:15.299
[laughter]

19:15.299 --> 19:16.970
This is just the greatest thing.

19:16.970 --> 19:18.299
And we were trying to think

19:18.299 --> 19:22.470
if there's ever been a mentalist
doing a mentalist act

19:22.470 --> 19:25.029
that was sincerely funny
and sincerely good.

19:25.029 --> 19:26.500
You may be the first ever.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.529
- Wow.

19:27.529 --> 19:28.799
- You may be
the first ever to do that.

19:28.799 --> 19:31.799
[cheers and applause]

19:32.799 --> 19:33.799
- Thank you.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.730
[applause]

19:35.730 --> 19:38.269
- As Teller said,
"It was Salvador Dali

19:38.269 --> 19:40.470
doing pseudo psychometry," so...

19:40.470 --> 19:41.470
[laughs]

19:41.470 --> 19:42.700
And you do have a trained eye,

19:42.700 --> 19:44.529
and you were looking
very carefully at those cards.

19:44.529 --> 19:45.700
That worked very well.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.230
I want to say this
a little bit carefully,

19:47.230 --> 19:48.769
because I don't want
to give it away.

19:48.769 --> 19:51.970
But I have been following you
before your magic career.

19:51.970 --> 19:53.599
- Oh, thank you.
- And--singer, right?

19:53.599 --> 19:56.400
You were a lead singer and put
out a few singles, didn't you?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.400
- Mm-hmm.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.670
- And what did they peak
at in Billboard?

20:00.670 --> 20:02.400
- In the 50s, let's just say.
- In the 50s.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.200
So you peaked--you peaked
around the 50s.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.299
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and that's--

20:05.299 --> 20:07.000
- But I was in my 20s
when I peaked, really.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.299
This is all just sort
of the afterlife, you know?

20:09.299 --> 20:12.029
- Well, I think it was a great,
great, great act,

20:12.029 --> 20:15.400
and you did not fool us,
and I think we told you how.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.599
- Okay, well, thank you.
- All right.

20:16.599 --> 20:17.700
So are you satisfied

20:17.700 --> 20:20.930
that they know
how you did your magic?

20:20.930 --> 20:22.730
- I'm satisfied, yes.
- All right.

20:22.730 --> 20:23.730
- [laughs]

20:23.730 --> 20:27.700
- All right.
Well, thanks, Zabrecky.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.970
I'll clean you up later.

20:28.970 --> 20:30.700
[cheers and applause]

20:30.700 --> 20:33.299
Well, believe it or not,
we have more amazing acts

20:33.299 --> 20:34.569
coming up after this.

20:34.569 --> 20:35.700
We'll be right back.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.700
[cheers and applause]

20:38.700 --> 20:41.670
[jazz music]

20:45.900 --> 20:48.900
[jazz music]

20:48.900 --> 20:51.900
[cheers and applause]

20:53.069 --> 20:55.269
- Welcome back
to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

20:55.269 --> 20:58.869
where magicians try to match
wits with the masters.

20:58.869 --> 21:01.500
Let's meet our next
potential fooler.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.670
- My name is David Garrard.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.630
I work part-time
as minister to children

21:07.630 --> 21:09.730
at St. Matthews
Baptist Church,

21:09.730 --> 21:11.170
and I do magic.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.170
[light instrumental music]

21:12.170 --> 21:13.670
I've played a lot of schools.

21:13.670 --> 21:16.369
I've played a lot of gymnasiums
and school cafeterias

21:16.369 --> 21:17.869
and shopping malls.

21:17.869 --> 21:19.829
I'm sort of a GP,
a general practitioner,

21:19.829 --> 21:21.700
of magic.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.430
Claire, my daughter,
first helped me

21:23.430 --> 21:25.700
when she was 18 months old.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.269
She is a marvelous assistant,

21:28.269 --> 21:31.130
and I couldn't do
what I do without family.

21:31.130 --> 21:33.029
I'm very excited
to have the opportunity

21:33.029 --> 21:34.599
to be on "Fool Us,"

21:34.599 --> 21:36.099
and we've been working hard,

21:36.099 --> 21:39.269
but I also feel like we've been
preparing for a moment like this

21:39.269 --> 21:42.470
on a Las Vegas stage
for 40 years.

21:42.470 --> 21:45.630
Wow, is this a dream,
or is this really happening?

21:46.900 --> 21:49.900
[cheers and applause]

21:51.170 --> 21:54.970
- Ladies and gentlemen,
David Garrard.

21:54.970 --> 21:56.900
[cheers and applause]

21:56.900 --> 21:58.529
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.

21:58.529 --> 22:01.500
Tonight, we want to show you
how a trick is done

22:01.500 --> 22:04.369
and try to fool you
at the same time.

22:04.369 --> 22:05.970
Specifically,
we want to show you

22:05.970 --> 22:09.869
how to produce a beautiful
young lady from two empty boxes.

22:09.869 --> 22:11.500
Now, in order to do that,

22:11.500 --> 22:13.799
Claire and I are gonna have
to turn things around

22:13.799 --> 22:16.269
so you can see
behind the scenes.

22:19.329 --> 22:22.329
[laughter]

22:23.730 --> 22:25.430
Say hello to Meredith.

22:25.430 --> 22:27.000
[crowd murmuring]

22:27.000 --> 22:31.069
The trick begins with Meredith
hiding behind the big, blue box,

22:31.069 --> 22:32.130
hidden from our audience,

22:32.130 --> 22:34.369
but clearly visible to you,

22:34.369 --> 22:36.769
as you now watch from backstage.

22:36.769 --> 22:39.599
Magic is full of surprises.

22:39.599 --> 22:42.599
[hard rock music]

22:42.599 --> 22:50.599
â™ª â™ª

22:53.599 --> 23:01.670
â™ª â™ª

23:04.670 --> 23:12.670
â™ª â™ª

23:15.670 --> 23:23.670
â™ª â™ª

23:26.670 --> 23:34.670
â™ª â™ª

23:37.670 --> 23:45.670
â™ª â™ª

23:48.670 --> 23:56.670
â™ª â™ª

23:59.670 --> 24:07.730
â™ª â™ª

24:10.730 --> 24:18.730
â™ª â™ª

24:21.730 --> 24:29.730
â™ª â™ª

24:37.369 --> 24:40.369
[applause]

24:40.369 --> 24:48.369
â™ª â™ª

24:58.400 --> 25:01.970
- That's Penn's daughter, Moxie.

25:01.970 --> 25:04.730
David Garrard, everybody!

25:04.730 --> 25:06.930
[cheers and applause]

25:06.930 --> 25:07.930
- How'd you do it?
- No.

25:07.930 --> 25:08.930
- Not gonna tell me?
- No.

25:08.930 --> 25:10.900
- [laughs]
- Aww.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.700
You obviously got the most
beautiful assistant ever,

25:13.700 --> 25:14.700
so congratulations to that.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.430
- She was wonderful.

25:16.430 --> 25:17.430
- Aww.

25:17.430 --> 25:19.170
[applause]

25:19.170 --> 25:22.829
- And the fun thing about it
for me is the tall young lady

25:22.829 --> 25:23.829
was my daughter.

25:23.829 --> 25:25.200
- I was gonna say--

25:25.200 --> 25:26.230
- Yes.
- Wonderful.

25:26.230 --> 25:28.069
- So very special tonight
to have some

25:28.069 --> 25:29.329
dad-and-daughter magic.

25:29.329 --> 25:30.799
There's something magical,
I think,

25:30.799 --> 25:32.769
about the dad-daughter
relationship.

25:32.769 --> 25:36.099
- Absolutely.
It's so sweet.

25:36.099 --> 25:40.000
And I mean, obviously,
brilliant choice using Moxie.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.500
How did that come to be?

25:41.500 --> 25:43.369
- You try to surround yourself
with the best people.

25:43.369 --> 25:45.170
That's what I try to do, and...

25:45.170 --> 25:48.230
- Very smart.
- Moxie was just magnificent.

25:48.230 --> 25:49.569
- She's a natural.

25:49.569 --> 25:51.430
Well, and I recognize
your accent,

25:51.430 --> 25:52.829
and I'm a little concerned

25:52.829 --> 25:54.569
that I'm gonna start
talking like you,

25:54.569 --> 25:55.869
'cause you must be
from Georgia.

25:55.869 --> 25:57.829
- You take the Southern boy
out of the country,

25:57.829 --> 26:00.099
but you can't take the country
out of the Southern boy.

26:00.099 --> 26:01.299
- Yeah.

26:01.299 --> 26:04.269
Okay, well, it's time
to go to the boys.

26:04.269 --> 26:05.730
- We've been trying
to get out of Moxie

26:05.730 --> 26:07.970
how you did it,
and she will not crack.

26:07.970 --> 26:09.829
She will not crack.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.430
We're not gonna
try waterboarding,

26:11.430 --> 26:12.630
but she will not crack.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.369
- That's good.
That's good.

26:14.369 --> 26:17.230
- That is a classic trick
done perfectly.

26:17.230 --> 26:18.900
Dante developed it--
backstage with the magician.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.200
- Thank you.
Yes.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.000
- And a real inspiration
for a lot of our career.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.069
We always try to show
that different angle and so on.

26:26.069 --> 26:27.329
Love that trick,

26:27.329 --> 26:29.170
and the hardest part
of that trick--

26:29.170 --> 26:32.000
the hardest thing
to make good about that trick

26:32.000 --> 26:33.829
is to give
a real surprise ending,

26:33.829 --> 26:36.170
and I think,
with the help of my daughter,

26:36.170 --> 26:38.230
you got--Teller said that he--
[laughs]

26:38.230 --> 26:39.630
When she first popped out,
he went,

26:39.630 --> 26:42.230
"Wow, she's about the same age
as Moxie."

26:42.230 --> 26:45.069
[laughter]

26:45.069 --> 26:46.329
So you did a wonderful job...

26:46.329 --> 26:47.869
- Thank you.
- With a classic illusion.

26:47.869 --> 26:49.299
- Thank you.
- Beautiful, beautiful job.

26:49.299 --> 26:51.470
I think Moxie, however,
was the star.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.130
Don't you think?
- Yes, I agree.

26:53.130 --> 26:54.730
[applause]

26:54.730 --> 26:56.069
- All right.
You didn't fool them.

26:56.069 --> 26:57.299
- Thank you.
Oh, that's all right.

26:57.299 --> 26:58.900
- But you definitely warmed
all of our hearts,

26:58.900 --> 27:02.170
and thank you so much,
David Garrard.

27:02.170 --> 27:03.930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:03.930 --> 27:05.670
[cheers and applause]

27:05.670 --> 27:07.000
- Aww.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.500
Amazing stuff.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.500
I sure could use a break,
which is great,

27:10.500 --> 27:12.200
because we have
to take one anyway.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.630
More "Fool Us"
when we come back.

27:14.630 --> 27:17.630
[cheers and applause]

27:17.630 --> 27:20.130
[jazz music]

27:24.500 --> 27:27.500
[jazz music]

27:27.500 --> 27:30.869
[cheers and applause]

27:30.869 --> 27:33.329
- Welcome back to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

27:33.329 --> 27:36.029
It's time for our next
potential fooler.

27:37.670 --> 27:39.599
- â™ª All right, I'm about
to rap out the hot one, son â™ª

27:39.599 --> 27:41.470
â™ª So give me the microphone
and let me have some fun â™ª

27:41.470 --> 27:42.930
â™ª Penn and Teller
on the throne â™ª

27:42.930 --> 27:45.130
â™ª Saying, "Yo, just school
us up at the Rio â™ª

27:45.130 --> 27:47.470
â™ª Wayne Hoffman,
try to fool us" â™ª

27:47.470 --> 27:50.670
I've been known to freestyle,
but don't tell anyone.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.529
[laughs]

27:52.529 --> 27:54.799
I started doing magic as a--
as a child,

27:54.799 --> 27:56.799
and then after I started
studying human behavior,

27:56.799 --> 28:00.299
psychology, I realized
I could get away from props

28:00.299 --> 28:03.700
and entertain people
just with their minds.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.730
There's a very fine line
with mentalists.

28:05.730 --> 28:08.069
I once did a show,
and halfway through the show,

28:08.069 --> 28:10.430
I saw a girl reading verses
of the Bible

28:10.430 --> 28:13.400
because she thought that I was
in the league with the devil.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.769
[laughs]

28:14.769 --> 28:16.569
I don't claim to have
supernatural powers,

28:16.569 --> 28:19.400
but people believe it.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.400
[cheers and applause]

28:24.329 --> 28:27.269
- Our next performer was once
Snoop Dogg's neighbor,

28:27.269 --> 28:31.130
so welcome the real dizzle
for shizzle, Wayne Hoffman.

28:31.130 --> 28:32.130
- Welcome!

28:32.130 --> 28:33.500
Quick question
before we begin.

28:33.500 --> 28:37.569
Do you believe it's possible
to predict the future?

28:37.569 --> 28:39.200
A lot of people say no,

28:39.200 --> 28:40.529
but those same people
are gonna go

28:40.529 --> 28:43.130
and check the weather forecast
for this weekend.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.400
It's nothing more
than a prediction of the future

28:45.400 --> 28:46.970
that you're relying on.

28:46.970 --> 28:49.200
Well, as a kid,
there was a group of us

28:49.200 --> 28:50.799
at school that believed
it was possible.

28:50.799 --> 28:53.099
So I decided to start a club.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.599
I started a club called
the Mind Candy Club,

28:55.599 --> 28:56.970
for those of us
that believed.

28:56.970 --> 28:59.970
And here tonight, right in
the Rio at--in Las Vegas,

28:59.970 --> 29:02.299
we are going to induct
a new member into my club,

29:02.299 --> 29:03.470
and it's gonna be one of you.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.069
So if you have a--
and just, you know what?

29:05.069 --> 29:07.430
Let's get one of the locals.
Those people are crazy in Vegas.

29:07.430 --> 29:10.099
If you're a local and you have
your driver's license with you,

29:10.099 --> 29:11.799
we want a guy
with a driver's license.

29:11.799 --> 29:13.500
So if that's you,
and you want to volunteer,

29:13.500 --> 29:14.829
just raise your hand,

29:14.829 --> 29:17.130
and in fact, I'm gonna let
Mr. Penn Jillette select

29:17.130 --> 29:20.099
who amongst the audience
we're gonna induct tonight.

29:21.099 --> 29:22.470
- Yeah.
I don't know.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.000
You, with the glasses
and the blue shirt right there.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.369
How about you?
Let's induct you.

29:26.369 --> 29:28.299
- Welcome.
Come on up here.

29:28.299 --> 29:31.299
[applause]

29:31.299 --> 29:32.799
Welcome to the party.

29:32.799 --> 29:34.170
- Thank you.
- Come on over here.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.569
Now, did you have any clue that
you would be up here tonight?

29:36.569 --> 29:37.930
- No idea.

29:37.930 --> 29:40.269
- I could tell by the look on
your face when Penn picked you.

29:40.269 --> 29:41.529
Now, here's the thing.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.130
In this envelope, I have
a little welcome letter for you,

29:44.130 --> 29:45.730
since you're the new member
of the club.

29:45.730 --> 29:47.329
Do you have your
driver's license on you?

29:47.329 --> 29:48.329
- Yes.
- Cool. Pull it out.

29:48.329 --> 29:49.670
We need it.

29:49.670 --> 29:51.170
I'm sure you've done this before
at a traffic stop.

29:51.170 --> 29:52.869
We all have.
Don't worry.

29:52.869 --> 29:54.130
No registration needed.

29:54.130 --> 29:55.869
Cool.
Yeah.

29:55.869 --> 29:56.930
That's you.

29:56.930 --> 29:58.430
I knew this was going to happen,

29:58.430 --> 30:00.299
and I have proof.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.900
Inside of this envelope here
is your welcome letter.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.970
I printed this on my computer,

30:05.970 --> 30:08.130
knowing that this was
going to occur.

30:08.130 --> 30:09.400
Hang onto that.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.130
I want you to unfold it.
Open it up.

30:11.130 --> 30:12.670
- Yeah.
- Pull it open all the way.

30:12.670 --> 30:14.369
Yeah, and there's
something printed here.

30:14.369 --> 30:15.569
Isn't that weird?

30:15.569 --> 30:17.400
I can tell by the look
on your face already.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.700
Turn it this way and read it out
loud for everybody.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.400
Go ahead.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.400
From the top.
- "Dear Carlos"--

30:22.400 --> 30:23.670
- That's you.

30:23.670 --> 30:25.230
- "Congratulations on being
selected as a new member

30:25.230 --> 30:26.869
"of Wayne Hoffman's
Mind Candy Club.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.269
"We strive to make sure
our members

30:28.269 --> 30:30.230
"are intelligent, well-mannered,
and good-looking.

30:30.230 --> 30:32.400
"Please, present your ID
for verification.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.869
Welcome to the world
of mystery."

30:33.869 --> 30:35.630
- Yeah, you see, I had a dream

30:35.630 --> 30:37.529
that all of this
was going to occur.

30:37.529 --> 30:38.529
This is yours to keep.

30:38.529 --> 30:39.730
I want you to take that
with you.

30:39.730 --> 30:42.269
- Thank you.
- It was the strangest thing.

30:42.269 --> 30:44.299
It was--it was extremely weird,
the dream.

30:44.299 --> 30:46.700
You came in.
You had guns blazing.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.329
You were shooting everybody
underneath the sun.

30:50.329 --> 30:53.130
I don't know why,
but you took seven shots.

30:53.130 --> 30:55.269
Teller walked in.
He couldn't stop talking.

30:55.269 --> 30:56.829
It was extremely weird.

30:56.829 --> 30:58.970
I'm gonna keep this license,

30:58.970 --> 31:00.630
and I'll get it back to you
in a little bit.

31:00.630 --> 31:02.799
Give Carlos a round of applause
as he makes his way down.

31:02.799 --> 31:05.799
[applause]

31:06.930 --> 31:09.369
Teller, take your hands
like this, if you would.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.130
Slowly bring them together.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.769
Cool.
Perfect, and stop,

31:13.769 --> 31:16.170
'cause this is a perfect time
to start praying.

31:16.170 --> 31:18.230
[laughter]

31:18.230 --> 31:20.170
Right now, we're gonna play
a game called,

31:20.170 --> 31:23.130
"Is This Mentalist a Homicidal,
Suicidal Maniac?"

31:23.130 --> 31:25.529
Right now, Penn and Teller
have to decide

31:25.529 --> 31:27.869
whether or not
they are about to die.

31:27.869 --> 31:30.069
Clearly, by the fact
that they're still sitting here,

31:30.069 --> 31:31.170
they're choosing to believe

31:31.170 --> 31:33.500
that I am not going to kill him,

31:33.500 --> 31:35.599
a prediction which
they are making right now.

31:35.599 --> 31:37.069
It's kind of life or death.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.400
Well, I'll tell you what.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.799
Teller, if you don't mind,
just hang onto that.

31:40.799 --> 31:42.069
- [laughs]

31:42.069 --> 31:45.470
[laughter]

31:45.470 --> 31:48.230
- Now, would I really
kill these people?

31:48.230 --> 31:51.200
No, but the funny part is
if that would've gone off,

31:51.200 --> 31:52.529
that would've been
the definitive way

31:52.529 --> 31:54.670
to say that I could fool them.

31:54.670 --> 31:57.670
[laughter]

32:00.299 --> 32:03.299
[applause]

32:03.299 --> 32:06.329
But this is all building up
to the climax,

32:06.329 --> 32:08.200
and for it, I need to ask
Penn and Teller

32:08.200 --> 32:09.599
to join me onstage.

32:09.599 --> 32:11.700
I want all of us
to climax together.

32:11.700 --> 32:12.970
Let's welcome them.

32:12.970 --> 32:15.970
[cheers and applause]

32:15.970 --> 32:17.029
Grab a seat.

32:17.029 --> 32:19.170
Thanks for coming up.

32:19.170 --> 32:21.430
You can keep that as a souvenir.

32:21.430 --> 32:22.670
Now, here's the thing.

32:22.670 --> 32:23.670
Most--

32:23.670 --> 32:25.099
[laughter]

32:25.099 --> 32:26.829
Most people keep
their driver's license

32:26.829 --> 32:27.829
in their wallet.

32:27.829 --> 32:29.170
I don't.

32:29.170 --> 32:31.000
See, tonight, I have something
completely different.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.369
I have something weird.

32:32.369 --> 32:34.230
My membership, my club,

32:34.230 --> 32:35.900
is an organization

32:35.900 --> 32:38.269
that gives out
plastic membership cards.

32:38.269 --> 32:41.329
We actually keep these
with our name

32:41.329 --> 32:44.470
and our birth dates as proof
that we're members of the club.

32:44.470 --> 32:47.970
Inside of my wallet here,
pinned up,

32:47.970 --> 32:52.029
is a membership card
stamped with a name

32:52.029 --> 32:53.299
and a date.

32:53.299 --> 32:55.970
Now, we always
keep the birthdays here.

32:55.970 --> 32:57.869
In fact, it's embossed--
stamped into the card,

32:57.869 --> 32:59.230
like you would have
a credit card at home.

32:59.230 --> 33:00.599
Penn, feel it.

33:00.599 --> 33:02.130
Make sure that's actually
embossed and stamped

33:02.130 --> 33:03.130
into the card.

33:03.130 --> 33:04.500
- Yeah, well, it is.
- It is.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.599
Now, over here, read the name
that's at the top.

33:06.599 --> 33:07.799
- Carlos is the name.
- Carlos.

33:07.799 --> 33:09.200
Now, we still have
Carlos's license.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.970
Verify.
Is his name Carlos, Teller?

33:10.970 --> 33:12.200
Yes?

33:12.200 --> 33:13.970
It's actually there,
and underneath is a date

33:13.970 --> 33:14.970
stamped into the card.

33:14.970 --> 33:15.970
- Yes.

33:15.970 --> 33:16.970
- What is the month?
Just the month.

33:16.970 --> 33:18.230
- January.
- January.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.799
Was he--he was born
in January, wasn't he?

33:19.799 --> 33:22.200
Now, what date of the month
does it say on the card?

33:22.200 --> 33:25.630
- 14.
- Was he born January 14th?

33:25.630 --> 33:27.900
Carlos, welcome to the club.

33:27.900 --> 33:29.029
[applause]

33:29.029 --> 33:30.869
Penn and Teller,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:30.869 --> 33:32.000
[cheers and applause]

33:32.000 --> 33:33.900
- Whoo.

33:33.900 --> 33:36.430
All right.

33:36.430 --> 33:38.730
- Thank you.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.069
- That's incredible,

33:40.069 --> 33:42.299
and thank you
for not blowing them up.

33:42.299 --> 33:43.630
I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

33:43.630 --> 33:46.130
The explosion was mental,
not physical,

33:46.130 --> 33:47.829
'cause that's highly illegal,
I found out.

33:47.829 --> 33:49.029
- Yes.

33:49.029 --> 33:51.970
And being a mentalist,
do you prefer that over magic?

33:51.970 --> 33:53.700
- A lot of guys will say,
"I'm a magician.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.630
I'm a sleight-of-hand artist.
I'm an escape artist,"

33:55.630 --> 33:56.829
or, "I'm a mentalist,"
or whatever.

33:56.829 --> 33:58.529
- Right.
- And choose one.

33:58.529 --> 34:00.269
I took the path--I wanted both.

34:00.269 --> 34:01.470
I do mentalism,

34:01.470 --> 34:03.599
which is psychologically-based
stuff, mainly,

34:03.599 --> 34:05.369
and I also do sleight-of-hand
and illusion,

34:05.369 --> 34:06.369
'cause it's fun and I love it.

34:06.369 --> 34:07.569
- Right.

34:07.569 --> 34:10.130
And you're also
a body language expert?

34:10.130 --> 34:13.599
- You know, I would never even
say I'm an expert at anything,

34:13.599 --> 34:15.869
but little tricks,
like, for example,

34:15.869 --> 34:17.630
you're sitting in what's called
the fig leaf position.

34:17.630 --> 34:18.929
- Oh.

34:18.929 --> 34:20.329
- It's like you're wearing
nothing but a fig leaf

34:20.329 --> 34:21.670
right now.

34:21.670 --> 34:24.199
This is a position people
go into when they're nervous,

34:24.199 --> 34:25.900
like standing next
to a mind reader, maybe.

34:25.900 --> 34:29.000
- Mm-hmm.
- They go, "Protection mode!"

34:29.000 --> 34:31.030
- Okay. All right.
I'll stop.

34:31.030 --> 34:33.070
- Now you're--you're just
protecting the back now.

34:33.070 --> 34:34.630
That's--

34:34.630 --> 34:37.630
[laughter]

34:37.630 --> 34:39.369
[laughs]

34:39.369 --> 34:40.670
- Okay.
All right.

34:40.670 --> 34:42.030
Penn, Teller--

34:42.030 --> 34:44.429
- We have this one nailed,
no problem.

34:44.429 --> 34:46.599
This is not real dynamite.

34:46.599 --> 34:47.630
[laughter]

34:47.630 --> 34:48.630
It's just--

34:48.630 --> 34:50.900
- [laughs]

34:50.900 --> 34:51.900
Damn it.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.429
[applause]

34:54.429 --> 34:55.768
- Thanks a lot for being here.

34:55.768 --> 34:56.929
- Thank you.

34:56.929 --> 35:00.070
- Oh, wow!
[laughs]

35:00.070 --> 35:01.230
- Wayne.
- Yes.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.969
- You did something
really amazing.

35:02.969 --> 35:06.369
You did mentalism
without being a sleazeball.

35:06.369 --> 35:07.570
- All right.

35:07.570 --> 35:09.269
- You did mentalism
as a really good trick.

35:09.269 --> 35:10.369
- Thank you.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.900
- And it's a really
modern version

35:12.900 --> 35:14.769
of Card To Wallet,

35:14.769 --> 35:17.969
which is a--which is a classic
and a wonderful effect,

35:17.969 --> 35:20.699
but done where
it means something--

35:20.699 --> 35:23.300
done with a membership card
instead of a playing card.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.170
It's also--
it's such a new version

35:25.170 --> 35:27.929
that you could not have done
this trick 30 years ago.

35:27.929 --> 35:28.929
[laughs]

35:28.929 --> 35:30.130
- True.
- Yes.

35:30.130 --> 35:32.099
And I hope that gives you
a little bit

35:32.099 --> 35:34.599
of a--a little bit of a hint.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.969
- Uh...

35:36.969 --> 35:39.000
I'm--I'm a little slow.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.170
So maybe we can creep
around it.

35:40.170 --> 35:41.170
- Okay, okay.

35:41.170 --> 35:42.699
Well, what we really liked was

35:42.699 --> 35:44.670
we really liked the whole set

35:44.670 --> 35:46.630
and all the stuff
you had set up here,

35:46.630 --> 35:47.630
and Teller, you know,

35:47.630 --> 35:49.630
is redecorating his living room

35:49.630 --> 35:52.030
and was wondering if
he could borrow the tablecloth.

35:52.030 --> 35:53.469
Can we take that with us
right now?

35:53.469 --> 35:55.130
Could we borrow
the tablecloth right now?

35:55.130 --> 35:56.329
- Yes, absolutely, you can.
- We could?

35:56.329 --> 35:57.469
We could take
the tablecloth right now?

35:57.469 --> 35:59.369
- Yes.
- We'd love to see it there.

35:59.369 --> 36:02.030
- Oh, okay.
All right.

36:02.030 --> 36:03.170
- If we could take this...

36:03.170 --> 36:04.769
- Something under the table,
perhaps?

36:04.769 --> 36:07.269
- Tablecloth with us.

36:07.269 --> 36:08.829
- And there's a table.

36:08.829 --> 36:10.800
All right.
Okay.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.170
Oh, wait.
I see a finger.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.130
- We would like to borrow
this tablecloth for a party

36:15.130 --> 36:18.829
that we're gonna have
for you having fooled us.

36:18.829 --> 36:21.800
Yeah, but that's the whole--
you want to do it.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.730
I mean, because we thought--
we thought...

36:23.730 --> 36:26.070
- Oh, my God.
You fooled them!

36:26.070 --> 36:28.900
- There was a printer
under this table,

36:28.900 --> 36:29.900
and there's not.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.030
- That is so cool.
- Oh, man!

36:31.030 --> 36:33.099
- There's nothing there
whatsoever.

36:33.099 --> 36:35.869
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Wayne Hoffman

36:35.869 --> 36:39.099
just fooled Penn and Teller!

36:39.099 --> 36:40.670
[cheers and applause]

36:40.670 --> 36:42.230
- All right, you guys.
Thank you so much.

36:42.230 --> 36:43.230
- All right.

36:43.230 --> 36:46.230
[cheers and applause]

36:47.869 --> 36:49.599
I can't believe you two
fell for that.

36:49.599 --> 36:51.699
Everyone knows how
that one's done.

36:51.699 --> 36:53.400
Well, I'll explain it
to these guys

36:53.400 --> 36:54.829
while we take a quick break.

36:54.829 --> 36:57.829
[jazz music]

36:57.829 --> 37:00.400
â™ª â™ª

37:04.730 --> 37:07.730
[jazz music]

37:07.730 --> 37:10.730
[cheers and applause]

37:12.530 --> 37:13.900
- Ladies and gentlemen,

37:13.900 --> 37:17.099
the best double act
in the history of magic,

37:17.099 --> 37:21.570
the great, great
Penn and Teller.

37:21.570 --> 37:24.570
[cheers and applause]

37:26.000 --> 37:29.769
- This--you're about to see
