00:00.001 --> 00:04.269
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:06.038
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:09.274
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:12.478
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:15.414
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:17.216
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.218 --> 00:21.453
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.455 --> 00:23.522
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:28.162 --> 00:29.795
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:29.797 --> 00:33.065
  We need to find and stop the
four horsemen of the apocalypse.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.167
 <i> The first seal's been broken.</i>

00:37.304 --> 00:39.238
        I might have gone online

00:39.240 --> 00:41.173
            And hacked a copy of
             your birth records.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.641
               I just thought it
                  might help you

00:42.643 --> 00:44.393
                Figure out where
                  you came from.

00:44.394 --> 00:46.144
          I know what you did to
         charlotte, you bastard.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.281
      <i> You and this church</i>
         <i> are finished.</i>

00:49.283 --> 00:51.216
   Being a messenger gave me
           a purpose.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.151
Now that's over.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.286
<i>What am i gonna do with myself?</i>

00:55.790 --> 00:57.289
                           Vera:
                        Michael.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.891
          He's alive.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.492
         I can tell you
    where to find your son.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.162
                           Vera:
                         Leland!

01:03.164 --> 01:04.229
Leland, stop!

01:04.230 --> 01:05.731
         Don't do this.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.401
           (sobbing)

01:09.403 --> 01:11.437
      Erin: <i> No more seals,</i>
      <i> no more apocalypse?</i>

01:11.439 --> 01:12.738
       <i> So it's over then?</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:14.273
             Rose:
      <i> I mean, i think so.</i>

01:22.283 --> 01:24.116
            (gasps)

01:25.553 --> 01:27.619
            (sighs)

01:32.293 --> 01:34.860
 Got to love the morning after.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.264
 Please tell me there's coffee.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.333
You need to read this.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.472
           She left.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.309
"to all my dear messengers:

01:50.311 --> 01:51.543
"by the time you read this,

01:51.545 --> 01:53.312
"i'll be well
on my way to seattle

01:53.314 --> 01:55.147
      "to sort things out
     with my fiancé, jacob.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.850
"your choice to put the welfare
of others ahead of your own

01:57.852 --> 02:00.686
"has saved billions of lives,
including yours.

02:00.688 --> 02:04.256
"now you must each choose
what to do with those lives.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.225
"wherever you end up,

02:06.227 --> 02:09.360
 "know that you carry with you
        all of my love.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.829
             Rose."

02:10.830 --> 02:13.232
           That's it?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.566
              Yep.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.835
     So we can just go back
       to our lives now?

02:16.837 --> 02:19.238
   Maybe i can get my job at
the vet clinic in arizona back.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.506
Koa:
Koa lin,

02:20.508 --> 02:22.341
       American citizen.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.243
   I like the sound of that.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.811
        I'm gonna clear my name.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.378
         I'm gonna put this mess
        with the feds behind me.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.680
       Mind clearing mine
      while you're at it?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.683
      Maybe we can all get
         a fresh start.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.186
 Assuming that i can figure out
  where the devil hid my son.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.687
Do you think we're safe
from him now?

02:35.689 --> 02:37.589
                  I mean, can he
            still come after us?

02:37.591 --> 02:40.292
     Ah, devil's been here
          a long time.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.363
  I doubt he's going anywhere.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.497
      Well, in that case,

02:45.499 --> 02:46.665
I need an aspirin.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.766
        Anyone else?

02:47.768 --> 02:48.901
        Yeah, let's get
     some breakfast going.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.441
     How is that possible?

02:56.443 --> 02:58.177
I mean, if we stopped
leland schiller, then...

02:58.179 --> 02:59.511
                   I don't know,

02:59.513 --> 03:01.313
      But the second seal
        has been broken.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.616
         (siren chirps)

03:04.618 --> 03:07.219
     Reporter: <i> The carnage</i>
    <i> is indescribable, jane.</i>

03:07.221 --> 03:08.854
         <i> Rescue workers</i>
     <i> have already recovered</i>

03:08.856 --> 03:11.924
           <i> The bodies</i>
 <i> of nearly 200 nero employees.</i>

03:11.926 --> 03:14.393
     And it's estimated...
      Jane: I need to stop
       you there, andrea.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.661
    We just received footage

03:15.663 --> 03:17.329
       From the building
       security cameras.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.332
        The police have
 positively i.D.'d the suspect

03:20.334 --> 03:21.767
      As leland schiller,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.368
The alleged criminal mastermind

03:23.370 --> 03:25.337
      Behind the anarchist
     hacker group, abaddon.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.705
  Who the hell bailed him out?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.240
             Who the hell cares?

03:28.242 --> 03:29.474
                           Vera:
             What are you doing?

03:29.476 --> 03:30.976
Turn it back on.
                            Why?

03:30.978 --> 03:32.861
      It's hopeless, vera.

03:32.862 --> 03:34.745
    Schiller broke his seal,
 and it's only a matter of time

03:34.748 --> 03:36.615
        Before the rest
  of the horsemen do it, too.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.617
Peter: What if he's right?
It's starting to seem

03:38.619 --> 03:40.452
   Like this apocalypse thing
        is a done deal.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.920
                         Joshua:
                  Because it is.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.323
      Take it from the guy
    who can see the future.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.657
The future isn't always certain,

03:45.659 --> 03:46.959
And you know that.
Look, guys,

03:46.961 --> 03:48.727
       We have to fight.
                   Raul: We did.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.395
  You even talked schiller down.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.964
       If rose was here,

03:51.966 --> 03:53.699
       What do you think
      she would say to us?
But she isn't, vera.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.667
                She's out there,

03:55.669 --> 03:58.237
Living what's left of her life.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.410
Guys, you can't just
give up like this.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.445
Come on, have a little faith.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.313
                 Open your eyes.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.917
        We can't rewrite
    the book of revelation.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.322
            Joshua.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.423
         (door closes)

04:18.425 --> 04:21.293
              There's still some
                time to get out.

04:21.295 --> 04:24.329
 We could find someplace, hunker
 down before it all falls apart.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.565
                           Erin:
                I'm sorry, vera,

04:26.567 --> 04:28.867
But i think we should go.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.673
  Guess i'm out of here, too.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.610
                           Wait.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.612
      Can i catch a ride?

04:49.890 --> 04:53.525
   This cannot be happening.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.473
         ¶ i can't see
   what i'm supposed to do ¶

05:10.411 --> 05:13.645
¶ says the boy inside of you. ¶

05:16.684 --> 05:18.750
            (gasps)

05:20.487 --> 05:22.721
        (doorbell rings)

05:23.657 --> 05:25.557
           (knocking)

05:25.559 --> 05:26.725
            (sighs)

05:30.964 --> 05:32.764
  You look like crap on toast.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.400
 Judge not, lest ye be judged.
             Save it, bible boy.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.601
I still need you.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.403
Everyone is splitting up.

05:38.405 --> 05:40.372
Raul left with erin,
peter left with koa.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.857
They're all breaking up
right now

05:41.858 --> 05:43.341
When we should be sticking
together to work this out.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.443
           I'm done.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.677
        Vera, i'm done.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.778
You're done?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.447
That's it?

05:48.449 --> 05:50.048
             Yeah.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.616
      Rose is coming back.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.719
She texted me;
she felt the seal break, too.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.420
            So what?
So what?

05:55.422 --> 05:58.457
 Joshua, you're our only hope.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.492
I'm serious.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.361
          Have you had
   any other kind of vision?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.766
              No.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.434
      Thank god for that.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.703
     'cause if there's one thing
  i've learned from all of this,

06:11.705 --> 06:14.973
It's that prophecy is prophecy,

06:14.975 --> 06:16.842
   And there's no changing that.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.777
You want proof?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.413
Turn on the news.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.516
The world is two horsemen away
from annihilation.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.017
  You can't just ignore that.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.754
  What's your plan, go back to
the church and lie for a living?

06:35.529 --> 06:37.529
 What the hell is your problem?

06:37.531 --> 06:38.563
   This is important, joshua.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.599
   You have a new path, okay?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.000
  You can't just ignore that.

06:42.002 --> 06:45.170
  Don't pretend like you give
    a damn about the world.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.905
  You just want michael back.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.440
            And you, you haven't
            even told his father

06:48.442 --> 06:50.776
        That he exists.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.613
  And you're a piece of work,
         you know that?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.048
   Yeah, and you're a junkie.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.155
            (sighs)

07:03.157 --> 07:04.923
          (door slams)

07:10.464 --> 07:13.465
            (sighs)

07:13.467 --> 07:15.534
        (doorbell rings)

07:18.806 --> 07:20.038
         Damn it, vera.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.176
                            Man:
                         Joshua.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.511
 Jeff fairburn. I'm an attorney
   with your father's church.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.547
       What do you want?
   The board retained a new firm

07:28.549 --> 07:29.614
          In the wake
    of your father's arrest.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.649
         May i come in?

07:30.651 --> 07:31.983
              No.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.920
    Joshua, with senior in jail,

07:34.922 --> 07:36.455
The entire church is in turmoil.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.656
    No one knows what to do.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.825
             They need a leader.
             This is your chance

07:39.827 --> 07:41.693
    To take back the pulpit
   and share the word of god.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.495
I'm sorry, i'm all preached out.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.197
    I know your father froze
          your assets.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.598
              What if we made it

07:46.600 --> 07:47.799
       Worth your while?

07:49.203 --> 07:51.536
   I'm talking seven figures.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.706
        You want a beer?

07:54.708 --> 07:56.508
                           Raul:
            I'm thinking alaska.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.609
Erin:
That's kind of

07:57.611 --> 07:59.678
A long way, don't you think?
                 Exactly.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.812
   We can reinvent ourselves

08:00.814 --> 08:02.214
    So no one will ever know
        the difference.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.950
Well, i have heard
that it's beautiful.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.721
         Not only that,

08:09.723 --> 08:12.591
    But when the apocalypse
      finally goes down...

08:16.597 --> 08:18.630
     ...It'll take a while
          to reach us.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.931
              Meantime, at least

08:19.933 --> 08:21.666
     We can enjoy the view.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.601
           (chuckles)

08:22.603 --> 08:23.935
Okay.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.504
         Alaska it is.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.572
   You want to go get nadia?

08:27.574 --> 08:28.573
Amy:
She's outside

08:28.575 --> 08:29.574
        With some lady.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.643
    (indistinct conversation
            outside)

08:44.258 --> 08:45.891
                       Gabriela:
 Well, i don't like any of this.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.626
        This is not what i left.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.160
     You're coming to live
       with me in tulsa.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.529
    The day you walked out,
       you lost the right

08:50.531 --> 08:51.730
     To tell me what to do.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.998
         Tell her i'm not going.
I can't, nadia.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.966
      I asked her to come.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.902
                  You what?
      You're 17.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.270
 You should be in high school,
   hanging with your friends,

08:58.272 --> 08:59.871
Having fun.
This place isn't right for you.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.306
You belong in tulsa
with your mom.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.609
         How many times
    do i have to tell you?!

09:04.611 --> 09:05.944
   I can take care of myself!

09:09.316 --> 09:12.584
          (door slams)

09:12.586 --> 09:16.721
Could you possibly have handled
        this any worse?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.557
     It's good to see you,
          too, gabby.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.863
            (sighs)

09:30.070 --> 09:32.771
            (sighs)

09:35.576 --> 09:37.642
             Nadia:
        <i> Am i getting it?</i>

09:37.644 --> 09:38.944
Please tell me i'm getting it.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.078
                   Wait and see.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.014
       Come here, birthday girl.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.852
         3.4 gigahertz,

09:47.854 --> 09:49.588
      4 gigs of sweetness.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.089
         When i was 15,

09:51.091 --> 09:53.325
      I wanted high heels.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.794
      You want a computer.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.062
    Just tell me one thing.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.663
                            Hmm?

09:58.665 --> 09:59.864
    The black or the silver?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.234
         Wait and see.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.774
          My princess.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.824
             Epic.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.814
    Nadia,

10:49.816 --> 10:51.683
Abuela brought
<i>tres leches.</i>

10:51.685 --> 10:53.284
You have
to come see it.
                      Okay.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.121
                        No.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.731
     (mariachi music plays)

11:16.710 --> 11:18.276
                  Stop. Stop.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.347
                 How could you?!

11:22.349 --> 11:24.749
   Cesar...
                  You slept with
                     my brother.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.918
               You make me sick.

11:27.888 --> 11:28.920
                  Get out.

11:30.857 --> 11:31.923
                        Get out!

11:31.925 --> 11:33.758
                  And don't ever
                      come back!

11:35.195 --> 11:37.228
      (cries with gasping)

11:46.373 --> 11:48.373
             Jeff:
  <i> You'd have complete control</i>

11:48.375 --> 11:50.909
   Of the church's direction
          and message,

11:50.911 --> 11:52.243
Your father's office,

11:52.245 --> 11:53.411
Plus a new car,

11:53.413 --> 11:54.913
Company plane
and the ranch in alpine.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.281
      It can all be yours.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.283
   This is a lot to take in.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.118
                I wasn't in your
                   congregation,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.921
                  But i saw your
                      broadcast.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.990
    They tried to call you crazy
 when you said you had a vision.

12:05.992 --> 12:09.794
            But i knew something
           amazing had happened.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.296
                   And there are
                 others, joshua,

12:11.298 --> 12:12.464
          Who feel the same way.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.932
             They want you back.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.933
    My church?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.101
    My message?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.836
              And a fresh start.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.838
              Just come with me.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.140
                  And we'll make
                      it happen.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.383
Thank you
for the ride.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.886
       Figured i owe you
      for saving my life.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.790
        I can't believe
  i'm finally gonna meet her.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.325
                        You sure
                   you're ready?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.027
                There's no going
                 back from this.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.864
     There's no going back
   to the messengers, either.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.766
You saw them.

12:47.768 --> 12:48.900
   Doing whatever they wanted

12:48.902 --> 12:50.835
      Instead of thinking
         of each other.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.040
     I want a real family.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.260
You sure you got
the right address?

13:15.262 --> 13:16.928
              It says right here
            in my birth records.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.799
This is the last known residence
         of anne moore.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.064
Hey!

13:53.066 --> 13:54.332
Don't you understand
what "no trespassing" means?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.034
                  Sir, we didn't
                  mean anything.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.002
          We're just looking for
     some information on my mom.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.470
Well,
look around, kid.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.039
Trust me,
your mom ain't here.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.241
            I get that, but i've
           got a birth record...

14:03.243 --> 14:05.877
No one's been here
for 13 years.
                      Okay...

14:05.879 --> 14:07.212
But you keep flapping
your gums,

14:07.214 --> 14:09.214
And the cops will be
happy to stop by.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.216
     Come on, now, the both
       of you, let's go.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.450
            Please, just listen.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.185
Her name is
anne moore.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.058
                  Wait a minute.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.026
            Are you annie's boy?

14:30.337 --> 14:32.203
                           Raul:
              Believe it or not,

14:32.205 --> 14:35.340
     I was thinking of you
       when i called her.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.141
 It was the right thing to do.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.244
      Sure, it has nothing
       to do with you two

14:39.246 --> 14:40.979
Finishing
what you started

14:40.981 --> 14:43.014
       Now that my dad's
      out of the picture.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.093
         I knew if i didn't call
           her, you never would.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.898
That woman destroyed
my life.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.935
                     That woman?

15:06.673 --> 15:09.941
            That woman loved you
         more than she loved me.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.646
                  Yes, nadia, we
                  had an affair.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.300
    (sniffles)

15:18.301 --> 15:20.485
              And i won't lie to
          you-- we were in love.

15:25.225 --> 15:29.160
              But after you came
            along, she ended it.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.264
          She stood by your dad.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.233
               She stood by you.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.537
                  And that's why
                   i called her.

15:39.539 --> 15:43.274
        Because you are the most
    important thing in her life.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.090
       The publicist sent
        an e-mail blast

15:59.092 --> 16:01.159
      To the congregation
    announcing your return.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.229
              We're expecting an
  unprecedented turnout tonight.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.301
My father ruined my reputation
with these people.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.370
    Your father is no longer
          at the helm.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.042
        Now, try not to dwell on
          what he took from you.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.044
            Instead, i encourage
                    you to think

16:20.046 --> 16:21.679
                  About what you
                  stand to gain.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.215
        The firm is drawing up a
   revised contract as we speak.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.384
             After today, you'll
           be the head preacher.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.721
    Can't really believe it.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.723
Thought he'd be
here forever,

16:31.725 --> 16:33.191
Looking
over my shoulder.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.392
              Well, not anymore.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.197
The kingdom is
yours now, joshua.

16:39.199 --> 16:42.333
           All you need to do is
          step out on that stage

16:42.335 --> 16:43.668
And seize it.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.270
Come on, it's time
to share your vision.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.384
Vera, it's okay.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.351
I'm here for you.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.153
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.469
    What's this?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.307
              It's our son, leo.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.684
            I was gonna tell you
            about it that night,

17:33.686 --> 17:36.454
               I was so excited,
                 but when you...

17:41.795 --> 17:45.563
                 So his-his name
                     is michael.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.332
              I took him with me
            to a grant proposal.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.736
      We were in the terminal at
  the airport here in houston...

17:51.738 --> 17:53.571
Vera, where the hell
is my son?

17:54.607 --> 17:56.407
                      He's gone.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.743
  Been working here 30 years,

17:58.745 --> 18:01.446
  First 20 as a groundskeeper.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.148
     Last ten, the state pays me
   just to drive by once a month

18:04.150 --> 18:05.550
                     To keep the
                   drifters out.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.854
            Seen a lot of people
              come through here.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.523
       Most i don't care
          to remember.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.225
                    Who was she?

18:14.227 --> 18:15.560
Your mom?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.562
She's impossible
to forget.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.864
Local kid from a real
religious family.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.699
Folks never
let her out.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.702
She got herself
pregnant at 16.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.704
Family found out

18:26.706 --> 18:28.673
And made
her life hell.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.541
That's why
they sent her here.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.877
Because she tried
to kill herself.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.215
Her family abandoned
her here after that.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.350
         Cut all ties.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.818
Her boyfriend,
the father,

18:40.820 --> 18:43.821
He tried to visit once
but wasn't allowed in.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.857
Hell, he didn't even know
she was pregnant.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.525
              She was all alone.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.194
She was too young
to be a mother.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.662
But as time went by,

18:51.664 --> 18:53.564
She looked forward
to having you.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.467
Every day, i'd see her
standing at this window.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.237
Watching me water the yellow
lilies in the garden.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.571
They were her joy,

19:00.573 --> 19:02.173
Them and the thought
of you.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.511
But everything changed
the day the baby came.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.783
                     You mean...

19:12.785 --> 19:15.520
                I was born here?

19:17.190 --> 19:19.290
I can't believe you kept
this from me.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.625
        Had you been honest with
          me about your illness,

19:20.627 --> 19:21.692
           I was gonna tell you.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.327
    That is no excuse.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.396
                    I know.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.699
                   You're right,
                      i'm sorry.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.703
        All right.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.473
      Tell me everything.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.341
                      We were at
                    the airport.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.544
          I was paged and looked
         up at the flight board.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.546
            It was five seconds.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.781
          And when i turned back
       around, michael was gone.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.651
                   I didn't even
                   hear him cry.

19:46.653 --> 19:50.254
       Every trace just vanished
         in the blink of an eye.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.722
What about security
footage?

19:51.724 --> 19:52.723
                I've checked it.

19:52.725 --> 19:53.891
            Every single camera.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.560
              I have watched the
            tapes over and over,

19:55.562 --> 19:57.562
            And the one security
     camera that could have seen

19:57.564 --> 19:59.430
          Who took him was being
              repaired that day.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.898
        Okay.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.600
This is terminal c.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.268
Just walk me
through it again.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.670
Tell me exactly
where you were.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.373
          We were here, in front
           of these three gates.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.542
                 492 to toronto.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.544
           Two kids, both girls.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.547
                 734 to seattle,
                  a 12-year-old.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.217
     And flight 87 to laguardia,
             there were no kids.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.384
    Okay, fine.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.986
But what about...
                            Leo.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.287
                I've checked it.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.690
                Every passenger,
                     every gate,

20:25.692 --> 20:27.525
      Every possible theory that
     is going through your head,

20:27.527 --> 20:29.394
              I have checked.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.262
          And there's a piece of
          paper in all of this--

20:31.264 --> 20:34.265
           I can prove every one
        of those theories wrong.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.400
            Joshua:
      <i> Can i get an "amen"?</i>

20:36.402 --> 20:39.737
It is great to be back, friends.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.251
    Do you feel that, folks?

20:53.253 --> 20:55.319
          (affirming)

20:55.321 --> 20:58.256
    That is god's presence.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.625
    Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.326
And he is sending out a message

21:02.328 --> 21:04.028
     To each and every one
      of y'all right now.

21:04.030 --> 21:04.962
        Do you hear it?!

21:04.964 --> 21:06.597
           All: Yeah!
Huh?!

21:06.599 --> 21:08.866
        Do you hear it?!
           All: Yeah!

21:08.868 --> 21:10.901
        (crowd cheering)

21:10.903 --> 21:12.570
            (whoops)

21:14.374 --> 21:16.007
        Let me tell you
      something, friends.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.942
           I hear it.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.744
   And you want to know why?

21:20.747 --> 21:23.281
          Because i am

21:23.283 --> 21:24.749
          A messenger!

21:24.751 --> 21:26.817
        (crowd cheering)

21:32.659 --> 21:34.292
     Tell them your vision!

21:35.662 --> 21:39.030
      And the message i've heard

21:39.032 --> 21:40.698
        Is that this...

21:40.700 --> 21:42.083
             Vera:
       <i> What's your plan?</i>

21:42.084 --> 21:43.467
     <i> Go back to the church</i>
     <i> and lie for a living?!</i>

21:43.469 --> 21:45.403
        <i> You're a junkie!</i>

21:48.408 --> 21:50.574
          ...Is wrong.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.714
           You won't

21:56.716 --> 21:58.616
    Find god in these pews.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.918
       (crowd murmuring)

22:02.388 --> 22:04.155
Start the music.
Start the music!

22:04.156 --> 22:05.923
   God did not sell you that
40-buck t-shirt in the lobby...

22:05.925 --> 22:07.658
     (music starts playing)
         (crowd booing)

22:07.660 --> 22:09.827
      And he sure as hell
    ain't passing the plate!

22:11.698 --> 22:14.832
       God... Is nowhere
        near this place.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.537
You were supposed
to share your vision.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.738
    I can't do this anymore.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.039
         I didn't know
   until i was back up there

22:22.041 --> 22:23.741
 In front of all those people,
        but i am through

22:23.743 --> 22:25.643
         Living a lie.
Joshua, think about

22:25.645 --> 22:27.545
What you're throwing away here!
        This is lunacy!

22:27.547 --> 22:28.646
  I guess the old man was right.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.814
What are you gonna do now?

22:29.816 --> 22:31.615
                Follow the path.

22:31.617 --> 22:32.850
                   The real one.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.361
            (grunts)

22:43.363 --> 22:44.829
  Did you just have a vision?

22:44.831 --> 22:46.497
Tell me what it was!

22:46.499 --> 22:49.767
What did you see, joshua?!

23:00.413 --> 23:02.380
   When you were born, peter,

23:02.382 --> 23:05.983
They let your mother hold you.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.689
         <i> But only once.</i>

23:11.691 --> 23:14.458
            (crying)

23:14.460 --> 23:18.129
      <i> Because of her past,</i>
 <i> the doctors deemed her unfit.</i>

23:18.131 --> 23:19.430
               It's time, annie.
             No.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.664
Please?
    <i> They took you from her.</i>

23:20.666 --> 23:23.067
        No, please! No!

23:23.069 --> 23:25.403
           (crying):
          Please, no!

23:25.405 --> 23:27.638
Please!

23:27.640 --> 23:30.174
         Please... No!

23:30.176 --> 23:32.443
              No!

23:36.883 --> 23:38.482
           Please...

23:38.484 --> 23:40.551
         I have to know
     what happened to her.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.856
After she lost you...

23:45.858 --> 23:48.526
Annie became severely depressed.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.060
 Totally silent during the day.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.862
           Catatonic.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.665
The lithium calmed her
for a while.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.667
     But eventually i think
      she finally realized

23:56.669 --> 23:59.203
         She was never
      gonna get you back.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.005
And then...

24:01.007 --> 24:02.807
          I found her.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.576
          "found her"?
           Out there.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.445
Right over those

24:07.447 --> 24:10.014
Same lilies she loved.

24:38.544 --> 24:41.111
  You mentioned her boyfriend.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.780
                      My father.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.516
         His name isn't
      on the birth record.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.585
    Do you know who he was?

24:50.823 --> 24:53.190
   You sure you want to know?

24:53.192 --> 24:54.692
           I have to.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.629
             Raul:
             <i> Erin?</i>

24:58.631 --> 24:59.997
Can you just wait?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.265
I'm sure i could
sort this all out.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.933
           I'm sorry.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.235
I don't understand.
                    Yes, you do!

25:04.237 --> 25:05.169
                  Everyone knows

25:05.171 --> 25:06.737
   That you and gabriela have...

25:06.739 --> 25:09.206
                 Issues that you
               need to work out.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.808
   And it's none of my business.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.142
               But i can't wait.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.777
I just need to make sure
that nadia's okay.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.513
After that, it's alaska.

25:15.515 --> 25:16.714
            Raul, my whole life,

25:16.716 --> 25:19.617
         People have been making
               decisions for me.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.085
        First it was my parents.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.686
             Then it was ronnie.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.588
                  And then rose.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.190
                    Not anymore!

25:26.192 --> 25:28.225
        Amy and i are moving on.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.294
           And not tomorrow, not
             the day after that,

25:30.296 --> 25:32.196
                        But now.

25:38.804 --> 25:41.705
                           Erin?

25:41.707 --> 25:44.108
             What?

25:44.110 --> 25:47.077
        I'm gonna come with you.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.913
   Really? But what about...?
        Gabriela: Raul?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.281
                     It's nadia.

25:50.283 --> 25:51.815
          She's gone.

25:51.817 --> 25:52.983
 What do you mean "she's gone"?

25:52.985 --> 25:54.018
She left!

25:54.020 --> 25:55.719
We had another fight and now...

25:55.721 --> 25:57.221
       I can't find her.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.557
Please, raul.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.824
            You have to help me.

26:01.861 --> 26:05.062
        This is family.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.766
She's right.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.901
Go find nadia.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.603
                  What about us?

26:12.605 --> 26:15.339
       We'll always have
        the apocalypse.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.241
Gabriela:
Raul?

26:27.853 --> 26:29.587
        (car door shuts)

26:30.756 --> 26:32.623
Amy, it's time.

26:32.625 --> 26:33.691
Let's go.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.627
         Hey, i wasn't finished!

26:36.629 --> 26:37.962
         Where's raul?
    You said he was coming!

26:37.964 --> 26:40.197
    Well, he's not anymore.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.599
Okay?

26:41.601 --> 26:44.168
         Amy, come on,
    i said it's time to go.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.673
       Berries are in our blood.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.175
                  And growing up
             on the family farm,

26:51.177 --> 26:52.876
We learned the value of quality,

26:52.878 --> 26:55.346
    Hard work and commitment
     to a perfect product.

26:55.348 --> 26:57.348
We're the plowman family.

26:57.350 --> 27:00.618
And we grow everything
straight from the heart.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.023
       I know how you feel, leo.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.891
      Sometimes i wake up
         in the middle

27:07.893 --> 27:09.193
     Of the night with some

27:09.195 --> 27:12.162
   Flash in my mind, a new clue.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.632
       I search after it, but...

27:14.634 --> 27:16.967
     It always leads me nowhere.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.836
It doesn't make any sense.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.638
Kids don't just vanish.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.739
Somebody took him.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.407
We just have to figure out who.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.847
         I'm so sorry.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.184
No, i'm sorry.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.687
I can't even begin to imagine

27:36.689 --> 27:39.023
What it's been like
searching for michael alone.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.424
One afternoon is bad enough,

27:40.426 --> 27:43.260
Let alone... Seven years.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.063
But no more.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.866
From now on,
i am here to help you.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.434
  I appreciate the sentiment,
             i do.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.736
       I... I just wanted

27:52.738 --> 27:54.672
     To tell you the truth.
 I don't need to drag you down

27:54.674 --> 27:56.440
 A rabbit hole that you didn't
      ask for, it's okay.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.909
Hey, hey.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.911
       I understand that.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.847
      But this is our son.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.316
I have to be part of the search.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.156
            (whoops)

28:12.158 --> 28:15.292
       Go, brian! Go! Go!

28:15.294 --> 28:18.262
            (whoops)

28:18.264 --> 28:19.430
        (crowd cheering)

28:19.432 --> 28:20.698
            (whoops)

28:25.137 --> 28:26.704
        Brian, you were amazing.

28:26.706 --> 28:27.822
Mom?

28:27.823 --> 28:28.939
      Scott and jacob want
       to play laser tag.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.340
        Can we go, too?

28:30.342 --> 28:32.976
    Yeah, sure, honey, just tell
     them we'll meet them there.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.479
      (indistinct chatter)

28:35.481 --> 28:38.248
        He's growing up so fast.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.484
               And you've become
               quite the mother.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.487
               You're a natural.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.988
    For someone who's faking it.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.890
Just leave us alone.
                       Now, kay.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.058
                 You know that's
             not how this works.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.893
          Consider this a little

28:49.895 --> 28:51.895
    Reminder of what's at stake.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.164
                          I made

28:54.166 --> 28:55.466
      That child disappear once.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.067
              I can do it again.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.502
You told my husband
you'd give us

28:58.504 --> 29:00.871
         Till tonight.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.239
            Please.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.742
I'm begging you.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.410
       Don't take my son.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.898
                     This is it.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.933
That must be your dad.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.002
  (indistinct chatter nearby)

29:34.940 --> 29:36.540
             Peter?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.809
                          I know

29:38.811 --> 29:40.811
       It's scary, but...

29:40.813 --> 29:42.379
       The life you want?

29:42.381 --> 29:44.481
   The life you've never had?

29:44.483 --> 29:46.550
        You deserve it.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.464
All right.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.433
Drive.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.568
                           What?

30:04.570 --> 30:06.136
        We've come all this way.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.372
Please, koa, just go.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.373
Man:
Oh-oh!

30:09.375 --> 30:10.374
Boy:
Nice!

30:10.376 --> 30:12.075
Man:
You make one or not?

30:15.447 --> 30:17.848
             Peter?

30:17.850 --> 30:20.384
       I'd give anything
      to see my dad again.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.555
     You shouldn't give up
          this chance.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.827
I'm a fugitive, koa.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.496
        And that family?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.498
         They're happy.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.867
         They're safe.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.837
  If i got out of this car...

30:39.839 --> 30:43.540
  And walked into their life?

30:43.542 --> 30:45.609
         I would bring
    all my problems with me.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.579
    I'd... I just c-couldn't
        do that to them.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.619
        I learned a lot
      about myself today.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.254
     About where i'm from.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.256
      And where i belong.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.624
       What do you mean?

31:00.626 --> 31:02.960
       The family we had?

31:02.962 --> 31:05.863
They may not have been perfect.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.365
     But that doesn't mean
  we should leave them behind.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.009
           Gabriela:
      <i> We have been looking</i>
          <i> for an hour.</i>

31:19.011 --> 31:21.078
              I don't understand

31:21.080 --> 31:23.981
                Why she wouldn't
           respond to our texts.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.149
Gabby, she's 17.

31:26.151 --> 31:29.019
             Still... That's not
           the way i raised her.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.554
   I'm sure she's all right.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.289
    She's just angry at you.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.557
    I didn't want to leave.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.026
          Me neither.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.327
       That's not the way
        it looked to us.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.565
    We never saw you again.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.001
   Because i went undercover.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.469
I spent the last
five years

31:45.471 --> 31:48.071
  Working in el jefe's outfit
          for the dea.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.240
             What?

31:50.242 --> 31:52.075
      It was the only way
   they'd let cesar go free.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.211
      You see, i did that
     to protect our family.

31:54.213 --> 31:55.212
  So that nadia could grow up

31:55.214 --> 31:56.413
With a father.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.215
I couldn't tell you
about it.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.650
You sure as hell didn't want me
    around anymore, anyway.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.052
        That's not true.

32:03.355 --> 32:07.324
      I wanted you around
    more than anyone, raul.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.162
    You are nadia's father.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.568
            (sighs)

32:18.570 --> 32:21.238
         You must have
      at least suspected.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.574
 What am i supposed to do now?

32:24.576 --> 32:27.077
       That's up to you.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.547
         (phone chimes)

32:35.220 --> 32:36.420
           What?

32:36.422 --> 32:38.956
      I know where she is.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.691
                        (sniffs)

32:42.194 --> 32:44.328
          (door opens)

32:44.330 --> 32:46.129
                     Dad's home!
                    We won, dad,

32:46.131 --> 32:47.698
                         We won!

32:47.700 --> 32:49.232
     I heard! Mom told me.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.004
Oh, i'm so proud of you.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.209
     Hey, why don't you go
     get cleaned up, okay?

32:59.211 --> 33:01.445
 You can tell me all about it.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.280
      What happened, jeff?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.614
   Did the preacher tell you
       about his visions?

33:04.616 --> 33:06.066
Kay, i tried.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.517
      I-i sobered him up,
 i brought him to the church...

33:07.519 --> 33:08.869
I'm telling you,

33:08.870 --> 33:10.220
       He was this close
   to telling me his vision.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.521
       What do we do now?

33:11.523 --> 33:13.056
           We leave.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.124
 What are we gonna tell brian?

33:14.126 --> 33:15.625
        Does it matter?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.160
Just tell him we're
taking him for ice cream.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.196
 Just get him in the damn car.
        (doorbell rings)

33:24.670 --> 33:26.036
             Jeff.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.204
              Kay.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.774
      Such a lovely home.

33:30.776 --> 33:31.775
         May i come in?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.643
             You can't take him.

33:33.645 --> 33:36.179
  Please. We both know there's
 nothing you can do to stop me.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.180
We're done.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.181
Do you hear me?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.316
       Please just leave.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.618
                         No.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.453
       I know for a fact

33:43.455 --> 33:45.389
      That his real mother

33:45.391 --> 33:47.224
  Would love to have him back.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.558
       Do you ever wonder

33:48.560 --> 33:49.726
     How she must have felt

33:49.728 --> 33:50.727
     The day you took him?

33:50.729 --> 33:51.695
         Listen to me.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.130
We will do anything.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.199
                        The man:
         That's what you told me

33:56.201 --> 33:57.501
                 Seven years ago

33:57.503 --> 33:59.403
                When i found you
          crying in the airport.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.471
                 After-- what?--

34:01.473 --> 34:04.274
                     Your fourth
            fertility treatment?

34:04.276 --> 34:06.076
            I am the only reason

34:06.078 --> 34:07.244
                    You can call
             yourselves parents.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.780
                        Still...

34:09.782 --> 34:12.315
                 I am willing to
               let it all slide.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.184
                    There's just
                  something else

34:14.186 --> 34:15.585
   That needs taking care of.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.632
 You through freaking out now?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.237
              When did you start
                   working here?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.806
             Today.

34:35.808 --> 34:38.275
     This is great, nadia.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.842
     But what about school?

34:39.844 --> 34:42.379
     I'm finishing online.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.114
Couple months, i'll have my ged.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.282
      College after that.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.750
          I'm thinking
      of computer science.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.753
          Bottom line,
    i'm not going to tulsa.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.420
I'm staying here.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.522
        My life is here.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.623
                     Okay. Okay.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.827
    What if i was here, too?

34:56.829 --> 34:58.495
  I'm not moving in with you.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.397
                       Gabriela:
         That's not what i mean.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.199
I just want to know you better.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.338
       Part of growing up

35:08.340 --> 35:10.140
     Is learning to let go
      of the past, nadia.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.276
                        But like
                       you said,

35:13.278 --> 35:15.745
       You're old enough
 to make your own choices now.

35:21.253 --> 35:24.221
             Um...

35:24.223 --> 35:25.622
      I can go on a break.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.525
Maybe we could

35:28.527 --> 35:30.227
         Grab a coffee.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.395
       I would like that.

35:32.397 --> 35:33.897
       You want to join?

35:33.899 --> 35:35.866
               You two go ahead.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.467
               Have a good time.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.276
                     I'm so glad
                     we stopped.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.277
                   I'm starving.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.212
Man:
Thirty-three!

35:50.782 --> 35:52.382
              Koa:
      Two spicy italians,

35:52.384 --> 35:54.451
       Extra everything,
    and we should get chips.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.519
        You want chips?

35:57.489 --> 35:59.322
                Peter?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.702
Woman:
Pomegranate.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.404
Clears the liver.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.739
Detoxifies.

36:17.342 --> 36:20.177
  I'm sorry... Do i know you?

36:20.179 --> 36:21.745
              No.

36:21.747 --> 36:22.846
        But i know you.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.317
I once had

36:27.319 --> 36:29.286
     The same gift you do.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.421
Every generation,

36:31.423 --> 36:33.957
A group of strangers is tested.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.393
Tasked with the difficult choice

36:36.395 --> 36:38.762
  Of helping humanity live on.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.397
The choice to serve

36:40.399 --> 36:42.432
  The world or serve yourself.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.867
      You're a messenger.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.669
I was a little girl,

36:45.671 --> 36:47.437
     Upset i'd been chosen,

36:47.439 --> 36:49.439
   Frightened of the visions
         i was having.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.608
But with the help
of the others,

36:51.610 --> 36:53.577
      I decided to fight.

36:53.579 --> 36:57.380
And together
we succeeded.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.982
    We stopped our horsemen

36:58.984 --> 37:00.517
       And now you've got

37:00.519 --> 37:01.952
To stop yours.

37:01.954 --> 37:03.220
The only thing

37:03.222 --> 37:06.256
   That can stand in your way
            is you.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.296
       Mom, i have to go
        to the bathroom.

37:13.298 --> 37:13.830
              Now?

37:13.832 --> 37:14.898
       Now.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.016
Jasper said they were
her favorites.

37:36.255 --> 37:39.689
         All right, this town is
          getting way too small.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.518
              ¶ ¶

38:22.968 --> 38:26.303
      I saw these two boys
         in my vision.

38:26.305 --> 38:28.938
I've seen them
twice today, too.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.473
It's definitely a sign.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.641
                  These brothers
               must be connected

38:31.643 --> 38:32.742
                     To the next
                       horseman.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.577
   How can we know for sure?

38:36.448 --> 38:37.847
     We're here, aren't we?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.449
                         Joshua:
                           Look,

38:39.451 --> 38:40.517
                     We can save
                        humanity

38:40.519 --> 38:42.018
                       Or we can
                     abandon it.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.453
                  It's up to us.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.588
         It's not easy,
   standing up against evil,

38:45.590 --> 38:48.625
  But we're not the first ones
           to do it.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.627
                      There were
                         others.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.362
                    They saw the
                     same doubt,

38:52.364 --> 38:53.897
                       Faced the
                    same danger.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.833
                  But they stuck
                       together.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.369
       And if we do, too,

38:59.371 --> 39:01.404
    If we follow the signs,

39:01.406 --> 39:03.440
If we let go of what we expected

39:03.442 --> 39:05.508
  And accept what is intended,

39:05.510 --> 39:06.876
     Then sooner or later,

39:06.878 --> 39:08.611
        Just like them,

39:08.613 --> 39:11.748
                    I know we're
                  gonna succeed.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.949
                    Amen.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.751
Amy:
Together again,

39:14.753 --> 39:17.454
     Just like my drawing.

39:20.092 --> 39:21.591
                            Koa:
                            Wow.

39:21.593 --> 39:22.492
       Did you make that?

39:22.494 --> 39:23.560
              Yep.

39:23.562 --> 39:24.861
       Is this all of us?

39:24.863 --> 39:25.895
Amy:
Uh-huh.

39:25.897 --> 39:28.465
                           Well,
                     who's that?

39:28.467 --> 39:30.367
   That's my friend michael.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.601
        He likes soccer.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.015
             Secretary richards,
           what a pleasure to...

39:49.554 --> 39:51.054
You were saying?

39:51.056 --> 39:53.623
Cindy:
Leland broke his seal.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.058
     We work together now.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.493
           Remember?

39:56.495 --> 39:59.662
  Then... What are you doing?

39:59.664 --> 40:01.431
           Your job,

40:01.433 --> 40:03.066
Apparently.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.267
      Or had you forgotten

40:04.268 --> 40:05.467
       That we still need
        to find famine?

40:05.470 --> 40:07.003
   I've got it under control.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.138
            Do you?

40:09.641 --> 40:11.508
       Because it looks,

40:11.510 --> 40:13.543
             To us,

40:13.545 --> 40:15.612
    Like you've sent a fool

40:15.614 --> 40:18.081
   To find out the preacher's
          next vision.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.616
Cindy:
You should be out there

40:19.618 --> 40:21.050
  Eliminating the messengers.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.153
         Not playing...
                        The man:
        You know as well as i do

40:23.155 --> 40:24.988
  That we need the messengers

40:24.990 --> 40:26.689
   To find the next horseman.

40:28.026 --> 40:30.994
            Then...

40:30.996 --> 40:33.129
        Once you've all
      broken your seals...

40:34.699 --> 40:37.734
     ...We rule the rubble
           together.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.572
            Yeah...

40:42.574 --> 40:45.008
         About that...

40:45.010 --> 40:46.743
         Leland, here,
    and i have been talking,

40:46.745 --> 40:49.813
And, well, i know you're used to
 doing things in a certain way,

40:49.815 --> 40:52.015
But it hasn't really

40:52.017 --> 40:54.551
      Panned out very well
          in the past.

40:59.724 --> 41:01.891
Six times,

41:01.893 --> 41:03.893
To be exact.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.628
But each time
the horsemen have tried

41:05.630 --> 41:06.930
To break the last
three seals

41:06.932 --> 41:08.498
      Leading to rapture,

41:08.500 --> 41:10.700
Somehow they always get stopped.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.068
         Not this time.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.604
     We're gonna do things
     a little differently.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.206
  What are you trying to say?

41:16.208 --> 41:19.676
You're obsolete,
old scratch.

41:23.014 --> 41:26.149
We don't need you.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.257
            You dare

41:34.259 --> 41:35.992
    Think you can cross me?

41:40.699 --> 41:44.968
         I am your god!
