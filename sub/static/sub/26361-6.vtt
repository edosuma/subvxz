his truck on 52nd

08:11.578 --> 08:15.277

08:27.681 --> 08:30.379

unconscious?

08:31.685 --> 08:33.208

the wrong guy.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.557
Besides, when I left,

08:34.601 --> 08:36.037
Grace was still
standing and drinking.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.518

their friend under the bus,

- Yeah, I guess.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.846
she wasn't wearing any
when I got there.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.674
- So if we do a DNA test

11:14.717 --> 11:16.153
on the semen that was found
on her body,

11:16.197 --> 11:18.547
that's not gonna
match you, right?

11:18.590 --> 11:20.375
- Christ.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.463
We had sex.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.291
It was consensual.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.814
Now if you don't mind,
I have work to do.

11:24.858 --> 11:25.989
- If you don't mind,

11:26.033 --> 11:29.732
stand up and turn
your ass around.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.386
- Harvey can go
to friggin' hell.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.519
- Me Too this,
Time's Up that.

11:34.563 --> 11:35.520
You can't even pick up a broad

11:35.564 --> 11:37.174
at a bar these days.

11:44.225 --> 11:44.399
.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.488
- Meet Silas Perry.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.620
He admits to partying
with Grace Walker

11:48.664 --> 11:50.579
at the Black Bunny last night
till 2:00 am.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.146
- Interrogation One.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.539
Grace remember anything more
about what happened last night?

11:54.583 --> 11:56.193
- Nah, she was pretty tired.
- Well, call her.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.717
We need to get her
in here for a line-up.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.935
- That's gonna be a problem.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.328
I tried the number she gave us.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.982
It goes to
the Theta Phi Kappa house

12:02.025 --> 12:03.679
at Spence College.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.333
They've never heard
of a Grace Walker.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.292
- No, we must have
written it down wrong.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.513
No big deal, let's go back
to the building.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.344
No one lives here by that name.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.738
- No, no, I just dropped her
off here two hours ago.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.001
All right, look.
That's her.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.352
- Never saw her.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.963
- Look, she lives with, um,
with her boyfriend Tommy.

12:27.007 --> 12:27.964
He's a thoracic surgeon.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.226
- Nah, I got two allergists,

12:29.270 --> 12:30.532
three shrinks,
and a podiatrist.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.056
None named Tommy, Tom,
or Thomas.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.235
- You know, do me a favor.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.759
Let me look at today's
security footage.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.804
- Be my guest.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.197
- The bar was closing.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.720
Grace wasn't ready
to call it a night.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.766
She wanted to hit
some after-hours joint.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.028
I should've gone home.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.029
- But you were doing
your thinking

12:49.072 --> 12:50.160
from below the belt.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.988
- Stupid's not against the law.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.294
- Well, horny might be.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.165
- You knock all your women
unconscious?

12:55.209 --> 12:56.950
- How many times
do I have to say it?

12:56.993 --> 12:58.299
She attacked me.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.517
- 'Cause she was trying
to rob you?

12:59.561 --> 13:00.344
- Yes.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.522
- I'm married. We had sex.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.482
I can live with a couple black and blue marks.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.136
- At least he didn't say
happily married.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.138
- Well, he's tenacious.
I'll give him that.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.270
Finally, somebody
to end our misery.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.837
- Sorry to disappoint,
Lieutenant,

13:14.881 --> 13:16.056
but it turns out
Grace may not be

13:16.099 --> 13:17.535
who we thought she was.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.233
Not only was the number
she gave me fake,

13:19.276 --> 13:20.887
but the doorman at the building
I dropped her off at

13:20.930 --> 13:22.192
had no idea who she was.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.628
Take a look at this.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.239
See, she goes in.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.849
She turns around.

13:26.893 --> 13:30.200
She comes right back out.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.159
Now Grace was concerned

13:32.202 --> 13:33.900
about how her boyfriend
was gonna react.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.597
- If we don't tell him,
he'll never know.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.207
But needless to say,
without her testimony,

13:37.251 --> 13:38.556
this case isn't going anywhere.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.775
- Look, she stayed up
drinking with him

13:39.819 --> 13:41.472
until 2:00 in the morning.

13:41.516 --> 13:44.388
She had to have said something
that will help us find her.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.045
- That's correct.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.786
- I believe you, Silas.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.006
- I'm Lieutenant Benson.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.356
I am the one in charge here.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.836
- Oh, finally,
someone with a brain.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.837
Can I go?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.099
- Not quite yet.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.622
Before you go,
I'd just like to ask you

14:00.665 --> 14:03.538
a few questions
about earlier in the night.

14:03.581 --> 14:06.236
So you and Grace were--
you were hanging out,

14:06.280 --> 14:09.152
you're drinking.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.937
What did you two talk about?

14:10.980 --> 14:13.591
- I don't know.
Nonsense.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.680
TV, music.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.639
I told her I loved
the new Kanye album.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.946
She said she didn't know
he was married to Kim K.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.121
I thought that was weird.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.079
- She say anything
about her family

14:23.123 --> 14:24.472
or her friends?

14:24.515 --> 14:26.474
- I wasn't really interested.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.563
Look, I was drunk, I--

14:28.606 --> 14:30.173
- You want to get
out of here, right?

14:30.217 --> 14:34.612
You've got to give me
something.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.658
- Pancakes.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.921
- She kept going on and on
about some diner.

14:38.965 --> 14:42.925
I think she said it was on...
155th, near Broadway.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.754
- I don't remember.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.844
- Silas, your phone
is gonna ring any minute

14:48.888 --> 14:50.063
and it's gonna be your wife,

14:50.106 --> 14:51.064
and Detective Rollins
is gonna answer--

14:51.107 --> 14:52.500
- Oh, for Christ's sake,

14:52.543 --> 14:54.154
I wasn't interested
in the damn pancakes.

14:54.197 --> 14:57.113
I just wanted
to get in her pants.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.680
- Put him in the cage.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.077
- So it looks like
Silas lied to us.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.513
- Or Grace lied to him.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.080
- Oh, come on, who lies
about pancakes?

15:07.123 --> 15:09.082
All right, hey, let's start
knocking on some doors.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.214
She didn't just pull
that address

15:11.258 --> 15:13.825
out of thin air.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.827
Grace's last name
was Walker, right?

15:17.046 --> 15:19.701
- So look at that.
Come on.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.746
- George and Penelope Walker.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.619
George is a tech billionaire
who grew a conscience.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.838
They got any kids?

15:26.882 --> 15:28.405
- Two daughters.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.539
- Grace. Sure.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.976
Usually comes in twice a week
around lunchtime.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.325
- That's great.

15:35.369 --> 15:39.199
So can you call her
and tell her to come down?

15:39.242 --> 15:40.809
- Wait a minute.

15:40.852 --> 15:41.810
You think that's...

15:41.853 --> 15:42.811
- Grace Walker.

15:42.854 --> 15:43.986
- Grace, maybe.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.032
Walker, not a chance.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.033
- Are you saying that--

15:47.076 --> 15:49.774
that Grace is homeless?

15:49.818 --> 15:52.342
- Is she in some kind
of trouble?

15:52.386 --> 15:53.996
- Yeah, we think
she might have been

15:54.040 --> 15:55.432
sexually assaulted.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.565
- That's par for the course.

15:57.608 --> 15:58.958
Most homeless women--

15:59.001 --> 16:00.611
and I'm talking over 90%--

16:00.655 --> 16:03.005
have experienced
some sort of sexual assault.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.443
- She hasn't said anything
about it to me,

16:06.487 --> 16:09.403
but Grace is what we call
a "rough sleeper."

16:09.446 --> 16:11.535
She prefers the streets
to the shelters.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.408
- Which makes her way more
vulnerable to assault.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.583
- This is crazy.
I mean,

16:15.626 --> 16:16.932
I met Grace, I drove her home,

16:16.976 --> 16:19.239
I--she didn't--

16:19.282 --> 16:21.328
Grace is one of the ones
with good hygiene.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.460
She showers here or at the Y.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.723
- Okay, so she comes here
at lunch?

16:25.767 --> 16:29.031
- And when she does,
she usually sits with Tommy.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.293
That's him.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.904
G.I. Joe.

16:32.948 --> 16:33.862
- Hey, Tommy.

16:33.905 --> 16:36.734
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

16:36.778 --> 16:39.563
- Hey, we're not gonna
arrest you.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.478
- Oh, hell no.
- Stop, stop!

16:41.522 --> 16:45.004
- Out of my way!
- I said stop!

16:47.136 --> 16:50.400
What the heck?

16:57.016 --> 16:57.190
.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.974
- Listen, Tommy,
we just--

16:59.018 --> 17:00.149
We want to ask you
about Grace.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.415
- Your girlfriend.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.070
- We had a couple
of meals together.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.204
She's not my girlfriend.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.078
- Because she's a cuckoo bird.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.907
Look, whatever she did,
I had nothing to do with it.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.952
- No, Tommy, she's not
in any trouble.

17:20.996 --> 17:24.695
The fact is she might have
been raped.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.262
- And we think we found
the guy who attacked her.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.787
We just need to find Grace
so that she can ID him.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.616
- She's alive.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.836
- Well, that's one
for the good guys.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.015
People like us, we're, um...

17:40.059 --> 17:41.451
What do you call it?

17:41.495 --> 17:44.585
We're peripatetic.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.369
- That's a two dollar word.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.763
- Yeah, Grace taught it to me.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.333
I'd like to help her.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.248
But I don't have a clue
where she is.

17:57.641 --> 18:01.297
Are we done?

18:01.341 --> 18:02.994
- You know, we've got
some coffee and doughnuts

18:03.038 --> 18:04.822
in the break room.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.955
- All right.
Come on, I'll show you.

18:12.526 --> 18:13.831
- Color me depressed.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.660
- There's 76,000 homeless
in New York City.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.619
Drug addicts, mentally ill,

18:18.662 --> 18:20.011
victims of domestic violence...

18:20.055 --> 18:22.536
- Guys who got shot at
defending our freedoms.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.842
- And every one of them
has a story.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.106
- And some of them use
the word "peripatetic."

18:30.370 --> 18:31.588
You know, Grace...

18:31.632 --> 18:33.068
said her name was Walker.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.678
She got her free lunches
at the Walker house.

18:34.722 --> 18:38.552
She said her boyfriend
was a surgeon named Tommy.

18:38.595 --> 18:39.857
I mean, there is
a little bit of truth

18:39.901 --> 18:40.989
in all the lies she told.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.470
So she gave us
the phone number

18:43.513 --> 18:45.646
of the sorority house.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.474
- You're thinking
that she went to Spence.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.304
- That's definitely
a college word.

18:51.347 --> 18:58.354
♪

18:58.920 --> 19:00.356
- Trying to locate a woman
named Grace Walker.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.142
Do you know her?
- Yeah.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.405
God, I can't believe
this is her.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.713
- Her name's not Grace,
it's Sophie.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.063
Sophie Simmons.
We pledged Theta together.

19:12.107 --> 19:15.763
- About three years ago.

19:15.806 --> 19:19.114
Let me show you.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.811
Sophie was
the first real friend

19:20.855 --> 19:22.857
I made at Spence.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.641
That's when we pledged.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.730
Freshman year.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.212
- Nothing.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.866
That's the weird thing.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.737
It was like any other day.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.217
Sophie and I had coffee
together at the Commons

19:35.261 --> 19:37.001
and that was the last time
that I saw her.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.439
- So what,
she spontaneously combusted?

19:39.482 --> 19:41.005
- She might as well have.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.442
I went to American Studies.

19:42.485 --> 19:43.747
I guess she never made it
to Bio.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.665
- It was our freshman year.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.711
Someone was always
having a party.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.365
It was normal
to blow off class.

19:52.408 --> 19:55.237
Sophie met a guy.
He didn't go to Spence.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.978
When she didn't show up
at the dorm,

19:57.021 --> 19:58.762
we all thought she was...

19:58.806 --> 20:00.590
you know, sleeping
at his place.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.462
- So when did you tell
the school she was missing?

20:02.505 --> 20:03.941
- About a week later.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.466
They called her parents.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.119
Is Sophie gonna be okay?

20:08.163 --> 20:10.731
- We don't know.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.647
- Will you tell her
I love her?

20:13.690 --> 20:15.344
And...

20:15.388 --> 20:17.999
I'm sorry.

20:18.042 --> 20:21.132
Hey, Sophie, Sophie.
- Hello.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.439
- Come on, everyone's going
to the Zeta party tonight.

20:23.483 --> 20:26.312
- Everyone except for
this future doctor, that is.

20:26.355 --> 20:27.878
- Come on, you know
you want to go.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.358
Plus Paul's going.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.839
You better not
be lying to me.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.406
- And do a shot of tequila
with me.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.930
- I need to get dressed.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.280
- The video was taken a week
before she disappeared.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.934
- I can't believe
it's the same girl.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.327
- Three years
living on the street

20:41.370 --> 20:42.676
will do that to a person.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.286
God know what
she had to do to survive.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.636
- And in that three years,
no one ever talked to her?

20:46.680 --> 20:47.811
She never once picked up
the phone

20:47.855 --> 20:48.812
and asked her parents for help?

20:48.856 --> 20:49.900
- Her parents live in Rye.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.293
They're on their way here now.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.642
- Meanwhile, we have no idea
where she is.

20:52.686 --> 20:53.643
- Well, I did send a mass email

20:53.687 --> 20:54.992
with the photo of Grace

20:55.036 --> 20:56.820
to every single YMCA
and shelter in the city.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.866
- And, believe it or not,
there is an app

20:58.909 --> 21:00.171
that tracks the homeless.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.304
Street Life NYC.

21:02.348 --> 21:05.307
Here, look. It helps families
who still give a damn

21:05.351 --> 21:06.830
locate their loved ones,

21:06.874 --> 21:08.876
and I uploaded a photo of her

21:08.919 --> 21:10.181
with the hashtag #FindGrace.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.705
Maybe we'll get
a hit from there.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.184
- Yeah, no, we know
she took the name Walker

21:13.228 --> 21:14.838
from that building,
but maybe we can figure out

21:14.882 --> 21:16.144
why she chose the name Grace.

21:16.187 --> 21:19.321
- Yeah, maybe it's
where she fell from.

21:20.714 --> 21:21.671
- Yeah, I'm okay.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.934
- No, you're not.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.632
- My sister went missing once

21:25.675 --> 21:27.329
before we
institutionalized her.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.722
- She ended up living
on the street.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.333
- Yeah, with a junkie,
doing meth.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.336
It's the only time
I ever saw my father cry.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.731
Sophie's parents are here.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.820
- Okay.

21:43.214 --> 21:47.610
- The last time I saw her
was freshman parents' weekend.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.046
Patty and I were newly married

21:49.090 --> 21:52.049
and Sophie was upset
that I brought her.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.095
- Debra died
when Sophie was five.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.445
- Brain cancer.
- I'm so sorry.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.795
- I knew I shouldn't have gone
with Mark that weekend.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.146
- For God's sake,
she wasn't a child anymore

22:02.190 --> 22:05.149
and you were part of my family.
- But not hers.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.024
- Anyway, that's
the last time we saw her.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.287
- In those three years,
she never texted?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.549
Emailed

22:13.593 --> 22:15.943
- No.
- We hung posters.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.336
Stayed on campus
for over a month.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.729
Eventually Mark
had to go back to work.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.253
I don't know how many
private detectives

22:22.297 --> 22:24.081

22:29.609 --> 22:32.307

never mentioned you.

22:34.918 --> 22:38.008
- That's worse, I guess.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.404

this girl

30:25.780 --> 30:29.392

abandoned who she was.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.872
- You catch him, I'll cook him.

30:30.916 --> 30:31.873

30:31.917 --> 30:33.005

what happened.

30:34.615 --> 30:38.010

who assaulted her
