WEBVTT

00:03.005 --> 00:04.723
Previously on Enterprise:

00:04.845 --> 00:08.076
Whoever built these spheres
may have done it to create the Expanse.

00:08.205 --> 00:11.914
Why would someone want to create
a web of crippling anomalies?

00:18.965 --> 00:21.684
We believe that it is through prayer
and meditation...

00:21.805 --> 00:23.477
that the Makers become manifest.

00:23.605 --> 00:26.403
- The Makers?
- The creator of the spheres.

00:26.525 --> 00:29.801
The quicker you folks find these Xindi,
the quicker we can get to work.

00:29.925 --> 00:31.119
Military Assault Command.

00:31.245 --> 00:32.394
Captain Archer wanted the best.

00:32.525 --> 00:34.402
I've seen men like Hayes all my life.

00:34.525 --> 00:35.514
Lieutenant?

00:35.645 --> 00:39.035
That had nothing to do with
who knows Enterprise inside and out.

00:39.845 --> 00:41.801
It had to do with who the Major thinks...

00:41.925 --> 00:44.359
is more capable
of carrying out this rescue.

00:47.685 --> 00:49.915
It's only been a day
since we were enemies.

00:50.045 --> 00:53.924
Giving you the coordinates
to a classified installation is difficult.

00:54.045 --> 00:55.160
They're coming in.

00:55.285 --> 00:58.038
The coordinates match
the location of one of the red giants.

01:02.925 --> 01:06.759
Dr. Phlox says we have to prepare
for the possibility that Trip won't survive.

01:06.885 --> 01:09.274
When implanted with DNA
from another species...

01:09.405 --> 01:11.760
it exactly replicates
that species' lifecycle.

01:11.885 --> 01:13.204
It becomes a clone.

01:13.325 --> 01:15.634
You and Trip used to spend
a lot of time here together.

01:15.765 --> 01:18.677
I was instructing him in the practice
of Vulcan neuro-pressure.

01:18.805 --> 01:21.273
He was really starting to enjoy
those sessions with you.

01:21.405 --> 01:25.364
What's driving me crazy is
I don't know if these feelings are mine...

01:26.125 --> 01:27.319
or his.

01:30.685 --> 01:34.075
Malcolm can be a tough man
to get to know, I'll grant you that.

01:34.525 --> 01:36.356
He likes to keep to himself.

01:37.845 --> 01:39.563
This feel okay?

01:40.365 --> 01:42.401
But, you spend enough time
around him...

01:42.525 --> 01:46.359
you come to realise there's no one
you'd rather have watching your back.

01:47.605 --> 01:51.154
- I thought you said you weren't ticklish.
- I didn't used to be.

01:53.645 --> 01:57.274
- Maybe I'm doing this wrong.
- Maybe we should try another position.

01:58.325 --> 02:00.759
Posture? Sure.

02:04.445 --> 02:05.560
Take a seat.

02:06.885 --> 02:10.002
I just get the feeling that whenever
Lieutenant Reed looks at one of us...

02:10.125 --> 02:11.160
he sees the enemy.

02:11.285 --> 02:13.799
I don't think Malcolm thinks of MACOs
as the enemy.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.597
Competition, maybe.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.164
Relax.

02:22.205 --> 02:25.322
This is one of the first pressure points
T'Pol worked on.

02:25.605 --> 02:29.120
- Helped me get through many a night.
- Feels great.

02:29.645 --> 02:32.159
Too bad this can't be
a part of our training routine.

02:32.285 --> 02:34.003
You should bring it up with Hayes.

02:34.125 --> 02:37.276
His training regimen hasn't changed
since I joined up.

02:37.565 --> 02:41.478
- Major Hayes likes consistency.
- So does Malcolm.

02:42.165 --> 02:44.759
He told me that
while he was in Starfleet training...

02:44.885 --> 02:47.843
he ate the exact same three meals
every day...

02:48.205 --> 02:49.558
for a year.

02:50.485 --> 02:52.919
They're definitely
cut from the same cloth.

02:54.085 --> 02:56.440
Maybe that's why they get along so well.

02:58.165 --> 03:00.599
- How's it feeling?
- Still great.

03:05.925 --> 03:06.880
There.

03:12.565 --> 03:14.635
I feel like I've just had 12 hours' sleep.

03:14.765 --> 03:16.517
I guess I did it right.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.205 --> 03:31.160
Well.

03:33.205 --> 03:34.433
Well.

03:36.885 --> 03:38.398
That was unexpected.

03:39.445 --> 03:42.642
- Nothing wrong with unexpected.
- No.

03:45.045 --> 03:46.603
With a little warning.

03:47.805 --> 03:51.593
Consider that a little warning
for next time.

04:04.605 --> 04:06.914
It's been a long road

04:09.885 --> 04:11.603
Gettin' from there to here

04:11.765 --> 04:14.438
It's been a long time

04:15.405 --> 04:18.795
But my time is finally near

04:19.365 --> 04:22.755
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

04:23.445 --> 04:26.198
I will touch the sky

04:26.725 --> 04:30.115
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

04:30.365 --> 04:33.163
No, they're not gonna change my mind

04:33.325 --> 04:37.523
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

04:38.045 --> 04:40.764
I'm going where my heart will take me

04:40.885 --> 04:45.003
I've got faith to believe

04:45.525 --> 04:48.198
I can do anything

04:48.325 --> 04:52.238
I've got strength of the soul

04:52.765 --> 04:55.563
And no one's gonna bend or break me

04:55.685 --> 04:59.917
I can reach any star

05:01.205 --> 05:03.196
I've got faith

05:04.885 --> 05:07.843
I've got faith

05:08.605 --> 05:11.802
Faith of the heart

05:22.325 --> 05:26.477
Captain's Starlog, December 27, 2153.

05:26.605 --> 05:28.436
Using the coordinates
we got from Degra...

05:28.565 --> 05:31.079
we're en route to the location
of the red giant star...

05:32.565 --> 05:34.123
and with any luck, the Xindi weapon.

05:34.245 --> 05:35.519
Come in.

05:37.005 --> 05:38.484
You wanted to see me, sir?

05:38.605 --> 05:41.324
I had a conversation
with Major Hayes this morning.

05:41.445 --> 05:43.037
He wants to put your security team...

05:43.165 --> 05:46.601
and all the senior officers
through a series of training drills.

05:47.925 --> 05:50.803
We run drills twice a week.
Senior officers are free to attend.

05:50.925 --> 05:52.278
These would be different.

05:52.405 --> 05:55.078
They'd be conducted by
Major Hayes and the MACOs.

05:56.605 --> 05:59.483
- Sir?
- We're heading into a hostile situation.

05:59.605 --> 06:02.073
We don't know what we're going to face
when we get there.

06:02.205 --> 06:04.002
My people are ready, sir.

06:04.125 --> 06:07.322
The MACOs' tactics and technology...

06:07.565 --> 06:09.521
are two, three years beyond Starfleet's.

06:09.645 --> 06:12.318
Why not let them
pass on some of that expertise?

06:15.285 --> 06:16.843
You don't agree.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.563
The MACOs' expertise...

06:20.685 --> 06:23.563
comes from simulated combat,
all conducted on Earth.

06:23.685 --> 06:26.245
On the other hand,
we've fought numerous alien species...

06:26.365 --> 06:27.639
on many different worlds.

06:27.765 --> 06:31.121
If anything, we should be giving the
MACOs the benefit of our experience.

06:31.245 --> 06:32.997
Hayes and his men
have gone up against...

06:33.125 --> 06:35.798
a few aliens on this mission,
including the Xindi.

06:35.925 --> 06:37.995
They've handled themselves pretty well.

06:38.125 --> 06:41.515
I'd like you to coordinate
the training sessions with the Major.

06:42.805 --> 06:44.033
Aye, sir.

06:51.165 --> 06:53.156
I appreciate your stopping by so quickly.

06:53.285 --> 06:54.604
What did you want to ask me?

06:54.725 --> 06:57.637
Are you acquainted with
Corporal Amanda Cole?

06:58.285 --> 06:59.877
She's one of the MACOs.

07:00.605 --> 07:02.561
She was in this morning
with a mild headache.

07:02.685 --> 07:05.563
Says she's been experiencing it
for a week now.

07:05.805 --> 07:07.443
Every test I ran came back negative.

07:07.565 --> 07:09.556
Frankly, I was mystified
until she mentioned...

07:09.685 --> 07:12.483
she was receiving
Vulcan neuro-pressure...

07:12.605 --> 07:14.197
from Commander Tucker.

07:15.725 --> 07:17.477
You believe it's causing her headaches?

07:17.605 --> 07:18.560
I wanted to ask you.

07:18.685 --> 07:20.915
Neuro-pressure's
a highly specialised discipline.

07:21.045 --> 07:23.639
Commander Tucker's only been
receiving it for a couple of months.

07:23.765 --> 07:26.916
I thought it was possible
that he might have misapplied...

07:27.045 --> 07:29.275
- one of its techniques.
- It's possible.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.885
Well, I've already spoken to
Corporal Cole about using caution...

07:33.005 --> 07:35.599
but I was wondering if you might
have a word with Commander Tucker...

07:35.725 --> 07:38.080
perhaps during your next session
with him.

07:38.205 --> 07:39.558
Gladly.

07:40.325 --> 07:42.839
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

07:44.685 --> 07:47.643
- Lf there's nothing else.
- Oh, there is...

07:47.765 --> 07:48.959
one other thing.

07:49.085 --> 07:51.155
If you find time,
perhaps you could schedule...

07:51.285 --> 07:53.435
a neuro-pressure session
with Corporal Cole...

07:53.565 --> 07:56.033
maybe undo
some of Commander Tucker's work.

08:01.125 --> 08:04.800
Okay, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Friday. How does 0800 sound?

08:04.965 --> 08:07.354
I prefer to train in the evenings.

08:07.685 --> 08:09.721
- Any reason?
- You get a better workout.

08:09.845 --> 08:11.836
Muscles are looser,
reaction time's quicker.

08:11.965 --> 08:14.115
How about Tuesdays
and Fridays in the morning...

08:14.245 --> 08:15.519
Wednesdays in the evening?

08:15.645 --> 08:17.840
How about Tuesdays
and Fridays in the evenings...

08:17.965 --> 08:19.444
and Wednesday in the morning?

08:19.565 --> 08:22.921
- You're not making this very easy.
- I'm not trying to make it difficult.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.034
With all due respect...

08:24.165 --> 08:25.883
I think that's exactly
what you're trying to do.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.518
"With all due respect"?

08:27.845 --> 08:30.279
Is that what you call
circumventing my authority?

08:30.405 --> 08:31.554
I wasn't aware I'd done that.

08:31.685 --> 08:32.754
And what did you think you were doing...

08:32.885 --> 08:34.682
when you went to the Captain
with this proposal?

08:34.804 --> 08:36.921
If I'd come to you first,
you'd have turned me down flat.

08:37.044 --> 08:39.240
You're probably right.
But the decision was mine to make.

08:39.365 --> 08:41.481
I didn't mean to deprive you
of the opportunity.

08:41.725 --> 08:43.955
I think that's exactly
what you meant to do.

08:44.085 --> 08:45.916
Whatever you might think, sir...

08:46.045 --> 08:49.196
my only concern is the successful
outcome of this mission.

08:49.885 --> 08:51.204
As is mine.

08:52.565 --> 08:56.274
Tuesdays and Fridays, in the evenings.

09:02.805 --> 09:04.079
What's the problem?

09:04.205 --> 09:08.118
I can't understand it, Captain.
It's like the stars keep shifting positions.

09:08.285 --> 09:11.118
- What do you mean?
- There. They just did it again.

09:11.245 --> 09:13.122
Maybe it's one
of the navigational sensors.

09:13.245 --> 09:16.681
I've already run two diagnostics.
I can't find anything wrong.

09:16.805 --> 09:18.397
I think I have the cause.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.675
An unusually strong
gravimetric disturbance...

09:20.805 --> 09:23.000
approximately three light-years away.

09:23.325 --> 09:25.156
Let's go take a look.

09:41.685 --> 09:44.722
It appears to be a convergence
of spatial anomalies.

09:45.245 --> 09:47.679
It's more than 700 million kilometres
in diameter.

09:47.805 --> 09:50.797
Captain, I'm picking up
an intermittent signal. Very faint.

09:50.925 --> 09:53.997
An object,
approximately five metres in length.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.158
Let's see it.

09:59.525 --> 10:02.164
It's just a few hundred metres
from the edge.

10:02.405 --> 10:04.680
I'm reading one bio-sign.

10:05.685 --> 10:08.119
- Humanoid.
- Could be an escape pod.

10:09.925 --> 10:11.881
Are there any other ships in the vicinity?

10:12.005 --> 10:13.120
None.

10:13.565 --> 10:15.715
The bio-signs are very erratic.

10:16.525 --> 10:18.277
Bring the grappler online.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.082
- Try again.
- I'll see if I can compensate.

10:49.285 --> 10:50.240
Travis?

11:07.285 --> 11:10.402
- We're losing systems all over the ship.
- Helm's not responding.

11:10.525 --> 11:13.915
There are rising levels of
ammonium sulphide in the atmosphere.

11:15.525 --> 11:18.244
- Archer to Engineering.
- Commander Tucker.

11:19.365 --> 11:22.562
The helm's not responding.
We need full reverse right away.

11:22.685 --> 11:23.720
I'm on it.

11:39.205 --> 11:40.877
Helm's back online.

11:42.365 --> 11:44.959
- Get us out of here.
- Love to.

11:48.445 --> 11:50.720
We're ready to open the hatch.

12:20.765 --> 12:23.916
He's suffering from
a form of rapid cellular degeneration.

12:24.405 --> 12:27.158
- Do you think you can stop it?
- I don't know yet.

12:27.285 --> 12:30.641
I've managed to revive him,
but he's in a fair amount of pain.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.204
I'm Captain Archer.

12:42.765 --> 12:46.963
- You had no right to bring me here.
- We were trying to save your life.

12:47.085 --> 12:50.839
I didn't ask for your help.
Return me to my ship.

12:51.845 --> 12:53.995
Your vessel has minimal life support.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.593
You wouldn't last too long
if we took you back.

12:56.725 --> 12:58.602
That's none of your concern.

13:00.925 --> 13:02.961
What was that pod designed to do?

13:03.125 --> 13:06.037
I'm not answering any of your questions.

13:15.445 --> 13:16.719
You're dying.

13:16.845 --> 13:18.722
We're doing everything we can
for you, but...

13:18.845 --> 13:20.756
Take me back to my ship!

13:21.925 --> 13:23.916
He may be going into shock.

13:30.965 --> 13:32.284
- How's it coming?
- Good, sir.

13:32.405 --> 13:36.080
We're adjusting the nav sensors to
compensate for the gravimetric waves.

13:36.205 --> 13:37.684
Get us underway as soon as you can.

13:37.805 --> 13:41.115
Just need a day to upload
and test these corrections.

13:42.005 --> 13:44.758
- Learn anything?
- A great deal.

13:45.285 --> 13:47.196
The disturbance appears
to be expanding...

13:47.325 --> 13:49.281
at a rate of several kilometres
per second...

13:49.405 --> 13:53.080
and its location is exactly equidistant
to five of the spheres.

13:53.205 --> 13:55.400
Do you think the spheres
have something to do...

13:55.525 --> 13:58.323
- with creating this thing?
- It's possible.

14:01.485 --> 14:04.079
This planet was once
an inhabited world.

14:04.205 --> 14:07.993
It was engulfed some time ago.
I couldn't find any signs of life.

14:09.605 --> 14:12.563
Maybe the alien we picked up
is the last survivor.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.118
A possibility.

14:17.045 --> 14:19.400
I want you and Trip
to take a look at the pod.

14:19.525 --> 14:23.313
If we can't revive the alien, it may
be our best source of information.

14:34.405 --> 14:37.203
We incorporate elements
from numerous disciplines.

14:37.325 --> 14:40.283
It's extremely effective
in hand-to-hand situations.

14:40.405 --> 14:43.317
What I'd like to do now is break up
into sparring pairs...

14:43.445 --> 14:45.436
run through some of the moves
you just saw.

14:45.565 --> 14:46.998
Let's get started.

15:31.685 --> 15:33.118
Try the combination.

15:35.725 --> 15:37.044
Nice cross.

15:43.845 --> 15:44.880
Excellent.

15:49.405 --> 15:51.282
Effective combination.

16:03.485 --> 16:07.319
You were looking at his hands when
you should've been watching his eyes.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.319
Good match.

16:14.645 --> 16:16.476
All right,
why don't we take five minutes...

16:16.605 --> 16:18.084
That's all for today.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.197
We still have the shoulder throws
to cover.

16:20.325 --> 16:22.361
Session is over.

16:28.565 --> 16:29.634
Okay.

16:30.205 --> 16:33.641
For next time, work on your
forearm blocks, and the elbow strikes.

16:33.765 --> 16:34.800
Dismissed.

16:37.565 --> 16:40.204
- What the hell was that?
- That was a sparring demonstration.

16:40.325 --> 16:41.394
It was way out of line.

16:41.525 --> 16:43.322
That last throw
was completely unnecessary.

16:43.445 --> 16:45.117
He was on his feet.
That made him fair game.

16:45.245 --> 16:47.918
- Fair game?
- It's just a little blood, sir.

16:48.045 --> 16:50.957
- No one got hurt.
- These are training sessions, Major.

16:51.085 --> 16:55.442
If your men can't understand that, then
I'm going to put a stop to this right now.

16:55.565 --> 16:57.044
Is that clear?

16:58.765 --> 17:01.484
- Perfectly.
- Jolly good.

17:07.405 --> 17:10.840
I think it's a transmitter.
I just can't pinpoint the frequency.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.154
Dr. Phlox has asked me
to speak with you.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.637
What about?

17:17.605 --> 17:19.960
Corporal Cole has been
experiencing headaches.

17:20.085 --> 17:21.837
The Doctor believes
they might be caused...

17:21.964 --> 17:23.842
by your neuro-pressure sessions.

17:24.765 --> 17:26.835
She never said anything
about headaches.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.320
Perhaps she didn't want to worry you.

17:30.725 --> 17:32.920
Why would neuro-pressure
be the cause?

17:33.125 --> 17:35.002
It shouldn't be performed by novices.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.958
If misapplied,
you could cause nerve damage.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.081
- I performed it on you plenty of times.
- Under my supervision.

17:42.725 --> 17:43.840
I see.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.799
You want to supervise me
and Corporal Cole?

17:49.285 --> 17:52.482
I think it would simply be best
if you ended the sessions.

17:54.125 --> 17:57.720
These electrodes were collecting
biometric data from the occupant.

17:58.005 --> 18:00.838
Amanda won't be too happy
about ending the sessions.

18:00.965 --> 18:02.762
I'm sure she won't.

18:05.725 --> 18:07.636
What do you mean by that?

18:07.925 --> 18:11.201
I've noticed that you and Corporal Cole
have become somewhat friendly.

18:11.325 --> 18:12.314
Friendly?

18:12.445 --> 18:14.834
Last week you were eating together
in the Mess Hall...

18:14.965 --> 18:18.355
and in the training session yesterday
she touched your behind.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.359
You've been keeping
a pretty close eye on us.

18:23.485 --> 18:24.964
You're hard to miss.

18:26.725 --> 18:29.922
Look, Amanda and I
just share a lot of interests, that's all.

18:30.045 --> 18:31.273
We both come from Florida.

18:31.405 --> 18:33.441
There's no reason
to justify your behaviour.

18:33.565 --> 18:36.921
I'm simply suggesting
you might use some discretion.

18:37.405 --> 18:38.394
Discretion?

18:38.525 --> 18:42.040
It's not appropriate for a senior officer
to fraternise with a subordinate.

18:42.165 --> 18:45.441
She's not Starfleet.
There's nothing inappropriate about it.

18:47.165 --> 18:48.564
What's wrong?

18:53.525 --> 18:56.403
We need to get this data
to the Captain immediately.

18:58.245 --> 18:59.394
There's no mistake.

18:59.525 --> 19:02.164
The pod's hull contains
the exact combination of alloys...

19:02.285 --> 19:04.560
we found on the surface of the spheres.

19:05.365 --> 19:08.004
You remember
the Triannon creation myth?

19:08.485 --> 19:11.397
They believe that the spheres were
created by divine beings...

19:11.525 --> 19:14.039
who would one day return
to the Chosen Realm.

19:14.165 --> 19:15.996
And that the spheres were reshaping...

19:16.125 --> 19:19.197
the Expanse into a paradise
for the faithful.

19:20.645 --> 19:23.637
Perhaps Triannon mythology
has a basis in fact.

19:24.605 --> 19:27.039
It appears the pod
was designed to transmit data...

19:27.165 --> 19:29.599
regarding the alien's
physiological status.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.195
I believe he was inserted
into the disturbance...

19:32.325 --> 19:35.442
so someone could monitor
his exposure to the environment.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.124
A canary.

19:37.645 --> 19:40.796
On Earth, miners used to take canaries
into the tunnels with them.

19:40.925 --> 19:45.476
If the canary didn't die, the miners
knew the air would be safe to breathe...

19:45.605 --> 19:47.561
and they could proceed.

19:49.525 --> 19:51.277
His condition has worsened.

19:51.685 --> 19:53.277
He's literally disintegrating...

19:53.405 --> 19:55.475
and there doesn't seem to be any way
to stop it.

19:55.605 --> 19:57.482
I want to talk to him again.

19:57.605 --> 20:00.244
- I don't even know if I can revive him.
- Find a way.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.515
Captain, this man is dying
a painful death.

20:02.645 --> 20:05.876
- To keep him conscious is unethical.
- Until I get the answers I need...

20:06.005 --> 20:08.394
we're going to have to bend
a few ethics.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.923
Very well. I'll do what I can.

20:15.805 --> 20:17.682
Notify me when he's conscious.

20:27.445 --> 20:28.400
Corporal.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.275
- Come in.
- Thank you, ma'am.

20:33.725 --> 20:36.603
- I appreciate your doing this.
- Please, sit down.

20:38.205 --> 20:39.638
Remove your jacket.

20:41.205 --> 20:44.481
I assume Commander Tucker briefed
you on the proper breathing technique.

20:44.605 --> 20:45.560
He did.

20:46.365 --> 20:48.037
Begin with a deep breath.

20:50.725 --> 20:51.680
Good.

20:53.765 --> 20:55.995
Dr. Phlox did caution you
against any further...

20:56.125 --> 20:58.081
neuro-pressure
from Commander Tucker?

20:58.765 --> 21:00.437
I got the lecture.

21:02.605 --> 21:05.722
You and Commander Tucker
appear to enjoy each other's company.

21:06.925 --> 21:08.836
We do have a lot in common.

21:09.245 --> 21:12.282
Did he tell you we grew up less than
50 kilometres from each other?

21:12.405 --> 21:13.884
He didn't mention it.

21:14.125 --> 21:17.640
Our high schools were rivals.
We went to the same movie theatres.

21:19.685 --> 21:22.199
- What are the odds?
- Extremely low.

21:24.565 --> 21:28.240
Unfortunately, neither of our hometowns
exists anymore.

21:28.805 --> 21:31.035
They were both destroyed in the attack.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.996
Did you lose any relatives?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.958
My family moved up north
a few years ago.

21:36.965 --> 21:38.318
I was lucky.

21:39.285 --> 21:42.277
Commander Tucker was
greatly affected by his sister's death.

21:43.325 --> 21:45.122
He talks about her a lot.

21:48.405 --> 21:50.361
You're quite fond of him.

21:51.925 --> 21:53.643
What's not to like?

21:54.805 --> 21:58.161
He's a gentleman.
He's great to be around.

22:00.725 --> 22:03.000
And he has very nice arms.

22:04.925 --> 22:08.474
I apologise. I'll try not to press so hard.

22:10.725 --> 22:12.795
We developed this
specialised training system...

22:12.925 --> 22:15.075
at Jupiter Station a few months ago.

22:15.205 --> 22:18.993
The goal is to hit as many targets
as you can in 10 seconds.

22:19.725 --> 22:22.523
Lieutenant, if you're up for it?

22:28.645 --> 22:29.919
Fall back.

22:33.445 --> 22:35.242
Start him off at Level 2.

22:49.925 --> 22:54.157
Four targets in 10 seconds.
Not bad for a first go.

22:55.405 --> 22:58.283
But you might schedule
a little extra practice time.

22:59.085 --> 23:00.723
Kick it up to Level 4.

23:14.765 --> 23:17.837
Nine hits. That's a mid-range score.

23:18.485 --> 23:22.000
Corporal Cole here has the record:
14 hits at Level 4.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.123
I was having a lucky day.

23:24.845 --> 23:26.642
Okay, let's do some shooting.

23:26.765 --> 23:29.325
We'll start at Level 2
and work our way up.

23:29.885 --> 23:31.398
Who'd like to go next?

23:36.925 --> 23:38.995
That target practice was something.

23:39.445 --> 23:41.913
Sure looked a lot easier than it was.

23:42.365 --> 23:45.004
- You don't say.
- Come on.

23:45.365 --> 23:48.198
Your score got a lot better
as the session went on.

23:48.565 --> 23:51.557
I started picturing Hayes' head
in place of the target.

23:53.085 --> 23:56.475
- You two really ought to declare a truce.
- Oh, no.

23:57.445 --> 23:59.675
This is a fight to the death.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.963
I guess if I were in your shoes,
I'd be just as upset.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.522
He's determined to take over
the security of this ship, you know.

24:06.645 --> 24:10.001
- You really believe that?
- Everything he does points to the fact.

24:10.125 --> 24:13.879
It could also be that he wants
everyone to be as prepared as possible.

24:14.245 --> 24:17.442
You have to admit,
the extra training isn't such a bad idea.

24:19.365 --> 24:22.835
- Just drop it.
- Okay.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.923
So why don't you tell me about
you and Miss Cole?

24:36.445 --> 24:37.594
We're friends.

24:38.685 --> 24:42.519
- Is everyone on this ship watching us?
- You're pretty hard to miss.

24:42.885 --> 24:44.637
That's what T'Pol said.

24:44.765 --> 24:47.757
Is it true she's giving Amanda
neuro-pressure now?

24:48.205 --> 24:49.160
So?

24:49.285 --> 24:51.799
I heard it was damage control
from your tender touch.

24:51.925 --> 24:55.315
T'Pol's just smoothing out
some of the rough spots, that's all.

24:56.325 --> 24:59.476
And why were you giving Amanda Cole
neuro-pressure, anyway?

24:59.605 --> 25:00.594
What's it to you?

25:00.725 --> 25:03.478
From what I'm told,
it's a pretty intimate procedure...

25:03.605 --> 25:05.038
for just friends.

25:05.405 --> 25:07.157
I do it with T'Pol.

25:07.285 --> 25:10.436
Are you implying there's something
going on there as well?

25:10.685 --> 25:12.038
That's the rumour.

25:12.765 --> 25:15.404
Look, for the last time...

25:15.525 --> 25:20.235
there's nothing going on with any of us.
Between any of us.

25:20.365 --> 25:23.835
- Right. You're all just friends.
- That's right.

25:25.845 --> 25:28.803
I guess this Vulcan neuro-pressure
isn't that intimate after all.

25:28.925 --> 25:30.119
Exactly.

25:31.325 --> 25:34.522
In that case,
I've got a nasty little pain just...

25:34.645 --> 25:36.044
Just drop it.

25:41.405 --> 25:44.920
We know you were sent here
as some kind of a test subject.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.400
The region of space
where we found you...

25:48.365 --> 25:50.083
what is it?

25:50.405 --> 25:52.475
His pain medication is wearing off.

25:54.085 --> 25:55.279
- Hold off a second.
- Captain.

25:55.405 --> 25:57.794
I was sent against my will.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.644
I'm not from your part of space.

26:01.765 --> 26:05.235
I come from a trans-dimensional realm.

26:10.645 --> 26:14.160
- Keep going.
- I don't know why I was sent here.

26:15.525 --> 26:18.483
- I find that hard to believe.
- It's the truth.

26:19.565 --> 26:21.157
I was a prisoner.

26:21.285 --> 26:23.321
Because of my transgressions...

26:23.445 --> 26:27.120
I've spent my entire adult life
inside a cell.

26:27.405 --> 26:30.158
One day,
the guards offered me freedom...

26:30.285 --> 26:34.642
if I would participate in an experiment.
I agreed.

26:35.565 --> 26:38.443
That's all I remember before
I woke up here.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.720
We found you drifting in a pod...

26:43.285 --> 26:46.083
hooked up to
banks of monitoring equipment.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.594
You're telling me you have no idea why?

26:48.725 --> 26:52.684
The experiment was important to them.
They wouldn't abandon me.

26:53.925 --> 26:55.324
Take me back.

26:59.325 --> 27:03.477
- That's impossible.
- Lf you don't, I'll die. Please!

27:06.045 --> 27:07.922
What's happening to me?

27:09.445 --> 27:11.645
What's happening to me?

27:13.445 --> 27:15.515
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

27:15.645 --> 27:17.636
With Travis' adjustments in place...

27:17.765 --> 27:19.881
we've resumed course for the red giant.

27:20.725 --> 27:24.081
Between all this training
and the extra shifts in Engineering...

27:24.205 --> 27:26.799
I've been looking forward to this all day.

27:27.405 --> 27:28.360
Sit up.

27:37.245 --> 27:39.156
You aren't saying much tonight.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.594
Don't tell me you're still upset about
me and Amanda.

27:43.725 --> 27:45.158
I'm not upset.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.764
- It sure sounds like it.
- You're mistaken.

27:50.965 --> 27:53.001
Why would
a few neuro-pressure sessions...

27:53.125 --> 27:55.480
between me and a MACO
be such a big deal?

27:58.325 --> 28:01.283
- Unless...
- Unless what?

28:02.045 --> 28:04.559
Unless you're a little jealous.

28:04.685 --> 28:07.245
I don't experience jealousy.

28:08.045 --> 28:10.513
You're doing a pretty fair imitation of it.

28:11.245 --> 28:15.443
I am not, in any way,
jealous of you and Corporal Cole.

28:15.565 --> 28:19.274
You know, your voice is tensing up.
It's a dead giveaway.

28:19.405 --> 28:21.873
I didn't know you were an expert
in vocal inflections.

28:22.005 --> 28:24.519
I don't need to be an expert to read you.

28:26.045 --> 28:27.478
Come on, admit it.

28:27.685 --> 28:29.641
You're a little jealous.

28:29.765 --> 28:32.199
You're implying that I'm attracted to you.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.282
That kind of goes
along with the assumption, doesn't it?

28:37.445 --> 28:40.915
I think you're mistaken
about who's attracted to whom.

28:42.645 --> 28:46.433
- Are you saying I'm attracted to you?
- I don't need to say it. You already have.

28:46.565 --> 28:48.954
I don't remember that conversation.

28:49.205 --> 28:52.277
It wasn't you, it was your clone.
Sim told me.

28:53.605 --> 28:56.563
- Sim?
- He said he had feelings for me.

28:57.165 --> 28:59.804
- He told you that?
- Standing right there.

29:00.965 --> 29:02.637
What the hell was he doing
in your room?

29:02.765 --> 29:05.279
- Your voice is tensing up.
- Now you're the vocal expert.

29:05.405 --> 29:07.965
I don't need to be an expert to read you.

29:09.445 --> 29:10.958
I can't believe this.

29:11.565 --> 29:14.955
I'm jealous of myself?

29:15.085 --> 29:18.236
- You're jealous?
- No, absolutely not.

29:24.565 --> 29:25.680
Okay, maybe.

29:26.485 --> 29:28.555
Maybe I am. A little.

29:29.645 --> 29:31.875
Which would mean
you're attracted to me.

29:33.485 --> 29:35.715
It goes with the assumption.

29:39.325 --> 29:40.917
What just happened here?

29:41.085 --> 29:43.918
Did we... Are we?

30:04.965 --> 30:07.604
You're not like the others on this ship.

30:09.685 --> 30:12.074
They're from a different world than I am.

30:12.605 --> 30:15.677
What are they called, your two worlds?

30:16.645 --> 30:21.196
Mine is called Denobula.
My shipmates are from Earth.

30:24.805 --> 30:26.477
Am I going to die?

30:27.965 --> 30:32.755
- I'm doing everything I can.
- I'm grateful to you for trying, Doctor.

30:34.845 --> 30:35.914
Try to rest.

31:23.525 --> 31:24.753
Leaving so soon?

31:25.605 --> 31:28.438
- I don't want to distract you.
- It's no distraction.

31:28.605 --> 31:30.960
In fact, I could use a sparring partner.

31:32.085 --> 31:34.804
- Lf you're up for it.
- Always.

31:40.685 --> 31:43.995
Good forearm block. Nice back fist.

31:44.885 --> 31:46.477
Show me the combination.

31:50.165 --> 31:52.156
Faster on that combination.

31:53.485 --> 31:54.964
You're improving.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.674
You want to keep that left up.

32:05.805 --> 32:07.921
That's it, stay loose. Excellent.

32:09.685 --> 32:11.118
You're improving.

32:16.005 --> 32:18.075
See? You were looking at my hands...

32:18.205 --> 32:20.844
when you should have been looking
at my eyes.

32:23.445 --> 32:26.005
- Okay, Lieutenant.
- Major.

32:31.725 --> 32:33.363
- Tell me something.
- What?

32:33.485 --> 32:35.760
Why won't you let me do my job?

32:39.525 --> 32:42.562
Because you're here to enhance
the combat capacity of this crew...

32:42.685 --> 32:44.038
not take over Security.

32:44.165 --> 32:47.282
Is that what this is all about?
You think I want to replace you?

32:47.405 --> 32:50.522
You just can't stand
taking orders from me, can you?

32:59.405 --> 33:01.760
I have no problems
taking orders from you.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.995
After lunar survival training,
I can handle just about anything.

33:10.325 --> 33:11.917
Good sparring with you.

33:15.005 --> 33:16.120
Hayes!

33:24.365 --> 33:26.242
As you were.

33:50.685 --> 33:52.323
What was that?

33:52.645 --> 33:55.239
It's a little Klingon move I picked up.

34:01.565 --> 34:04.875
Tactical Alert.
Senior officers to their posts.

34:12.284 --> 34:16.244
He's disrupting systems as he goes.
We can use that to track him.

34:17.485 --> 34:20.476
- That was the secondary relay coupling.
- He's on B-Deck.

34:20.605 --> 34:22.357
Between the A-1 and A-3 bulkheads.

34:22.725 --> 34:25.956
We're coming up
on access tube 17-Baker.

34:26.405 --> 34:29.761
- He's moving in your direction.
- Can you be any more specific?

34:35.245 --> 34:37.759
- Malcolm, status!
- Our weapons had no effect on him.

34:37.885 --> 34:40.319
He's heading toward
the centre of the ship.

34:40.685 --> 34:42.801
Archer to Engineering.

34:43.525 --> 34:44.480
Tucker.

34:55.645 --> 34:56.714
Lieutenant!

35:12.445 --> 35:14.276
Magnetic containment is fluctuating.

35:18.125 --> 35:20.798
We need to reverse polarity
on the plasma coils.

35:21.245 --> 35:25.443
It'll trigger a feedback pulse.
Turn the T-valve all the way to the left.

35:25.565 --> 35:26.918
All right.

35:32.205 --> 35:34.514
Let's see if you can handle this.

36:01.685 --> 36:03.755
- Morning.
- Commander.

36:09.765 --> 36:11.517
Coffee, strong.

36:15.765 --> 36:18.837
- Some night.
- Eventful.

36:25.805 --> 36:29.514
I don't know who did more damage
to the engine, the alien or Malcolm.

36:29.645 --> 36:33.399
- How long before we can get underway?
- Another day, at least.

36:37.565 --> 36:39.954
I guess we should talk
about what happened last night.

36:40.085 --> 36:41.916
I've been briefed on the situation.

36:42.325 --> 36:46.318
Well, I was referring to what happened
between us...

36:46.965 --> 36:48.637
in your quarters.

36:52.285 --> 36:54.037
I guess I'll go first.

36:57.965 --> 37:00.354
Actually, why don't you go first?

37:03.125 --> 37:04.956
I suppose I should thank you.

37:06.205 --> 37:07.877
No need to thank me.

37:08.005 --> 37:11.202
For facilitating
my exploration of human sexuality.

37:13.085 --> 37:14.803
I'm not sure I follow.

37:15.165 --> 37:17.440
It's one of the many aspects
of your species...

37:17.565 --> 37:21.035
which I've been meaning to explore
since I left the High Command.

37:22.885 --> 37:27.037
Sounds like you're saying last night
was some kind of experiment.

37:27.685 --> 37:30.802
- I wouldn't use that term.
- But that's the general idea.

37:32.605 --> 37:35.995
- Are you getting emotional?
- No, I'm not getting emotional...

37:36.125 --> 37:39.083
I just don't like being compared
to a lab rat.

37:40.205 --> 37:42.196
I'm sorry if I offended you.

37:44.285 --> 37:45.320
Forget it.

37:47.725 --> 37:51.638
I'd appreciate it
if we could keep this between us.

37:53.285 --> 37:56.163
In fact, we should probably just forget
it ever happened.

37:56.805 --> 37:57.760
Agreed.

38:00.565 --> 38:03.841
Doesn't mean we can't keep doing
the neuro-pressure, though.

38:09.845 --> 38:12.882
Dr. Phlox says you have
a detached retina...

38:15.605 --> 38:17.118
a bruised left kidney.

38:21.565 --> 38:24.238
We're in a dangerous region of space.

38:25.045 --> 38:28.162
We're trying to stop an alien race
from destroying Earth.

38:28.285 --> 38:32.198
We face attacks from all sides.
Enemies everywhere we go.

38:35.005 --> 38:38.441
The last thing I need is to hear
that two of my senior officers...

38:38.565 --> 38:40.283
have been admitted
to Sickbay because...

38:40.405 --> 38:42.839
they suddenly regressed
to the level of five year olds!

38:42.965 --> 38:45.274
Don't try to tell me who started it!

38:45.885 --> 38:48.240
I don't know what the problem is
between you two...

38:48.365 --> 38:49.593
and to tell you the truth...

38:49.725 --> 38:52.558
I don't care,
but I want it settled right now!

38:55.365 --> 38:58.323
Settle it! That's an order!

39:00.685 --> 39:03.802
- There's no problem, Captain.
- It's settled, sir.

39:07.805 --> 39:09.682
- How are the drills going?
- Good, sir.

39:09.805 --> 39:10.999
Very good, sir.

39:15.165 --> 39:16.280
Archer.

39:16.405 --> 39:19.954
Please come to Sickbay, Captain.
The alien has regained consciousness.

39:20.085 --> 39:21.484
On my way.

39:28.525 --> 39:30.038
Think we're dismissed?

39:32.485 --> 39:34.601
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

39:38.685 --> 39:41.074
You weren't sent here against your will.

39:41.205 --> 39:43.560
You knew exactly
what your mission was.

39:43.685 --> 39:46.153
What were your people trying to do?

39:46.845 --> 39:49.359
You tried to destroy my ship! Why?

39:52.565 --> 39:53.839
Answer me!

39:53.965 --> 39:56.684
When the Xindi destroy Earth...

39:56.805 --> 39:59.160
my people will prevail.
