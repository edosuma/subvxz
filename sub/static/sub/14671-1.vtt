01:03.630 --> 01:05.757
My job takes me to a lot of places.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.294
It's got its down sides.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.495
I sleep alone. I eat alone.

01:12.338 --> 01:14.007
I'm used to it,
though.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.137
I'd like to meet someone.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.339
But it's tough when you live
out of a suitcase.

01:22.282 --> 01:26.150
I go where I'm told...
do what I'm told.

01:26.953 --> 01:29.922
I shouldn't complain.
The work is steady.

01:30.356 --> 01:34.292
The money's good,
but it's not for everyone.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.048
My name's Joe.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.591
This is what I do.

05:10.777 --> 05:11.744
You're late.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.676
Sorry, Mr. London.
They closed Chechov bridge.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.218
You're leaving?

05:30.430 --> 05:31.522
I need the phone.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.576
I can help with the bags.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.441
No, I can handle it.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.581
If you ever come back,
I can, I can use the money.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.024
Thank you.

06:00.827 --> 06:01.885
Goodbye.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.442
I was taught four rules...

06:23.649 --> 06:26.618
One, "Don't ask questions".

06:27.587 --> 06:30.078
There is no such thing
as right and wrong.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.792
Two, " don't take an interest in people
outside of work".

06:35.495 --> 06:37.360
There is no such thing as trust.

06:38.097 --> 06:40.827
Three, "Erase every trace".

06:41.467 --> 06:44.231
Come anonymous
and leave nothing behind.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.500
Four, "Know when to get out".

06:49.509 --> 06:52.603
Just thinking about it.
Means it's time

06:53.179 --> 06:57.013
before you lose your edge,
before you become a target.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.093
So you look for the right opportunity.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.328
Nothing too risky.

07:20.339 --> 07:22.671
Get the money
and disappear forever.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.073
This is it.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.571
Four hits, one location.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.115
The lastjob.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.745
Purpose of your visit to Bangkok,
Mr. Vincent?

07:36.889 --> 07:37.981
Holiday.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.160
Bangkok.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.727
It's corrupt,
dirty and dense.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.165
All my clients have one thing
in common.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.504
They feed off the people.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.565
There's big money in misery.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.302
Where there's money,
there's competition.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.208
and the guy paying me
usually wins.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.981
How will we know when he's arrived?

08:43.188 --> 08:45.020
We'll know when he arranges the pick-up.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.627
You're sure he's reliable?

08:49.896 --> 08:51.955
The Russians swear by him.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.534
How do you swear by...

09:01.140 --> 09:03.165
a man you've never met?

09:03.910 --> 09:06.845
We don't know him. He doesn't know us.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.046
It's better for us that way.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.679
It always starts the same way.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.017
Just like I was taught.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.589
Secure a safe location.

09:21.827 --> 09:24.796
Somewhere off the beaten path
where you have privacy.

09:25.464 --> 09:30.265
But you stay invisible too long, the human race
starts to look like another species,

09:31.037 --> 09:33.733
so you venture out, you observe,

09:34.140 --> 09:36.506
and then you return to
your invisible world,

09:37.443 --> 09:38.842
like a ghost.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.424
Hey, Larry Check out the pussy here.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.899
- Check out these girls.
- Hey, girls, what's up?

10:02.001 --> 10:03.400
Hello, gentlemen, ah.
How are you?

10:03.469 --> 10:04.766
- First time in Bangkok?
- Yeah.

10:04.837 --> 10:08.034
Rolex? Good one if you want. Yeah, yeah,
Look. Good. Rolex.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.598
Watch out, Larry. How much you want
to bet it's counterfeit.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.538
Two thousand Baht only. Two thousand.
It looks good. Good.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.580
- No. thanks. No, thanks.
- No, no. No Rolex?

10:14.647 --> 10:16.512
Never mind. Never mind.
You want girls?

10:16.582 --> 10:18.311
- I can get you girls.
- No.

10:18.384 --> 10:19.851
No girls?
How about boys?

10:19.986 --> 10:21.146
- You like boys?
- Nooo!

10:21.253 --> 10:23.483
- You don't like boys, no?
- No. Hey,

10:23.556 --> 10:25.490
Hey, how about you,
huh, cowboy?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.389
Five thousand Baht, new car
smell satisfaction money back.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.554
Super-rubber-pussy-guarantee, huh?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.030
Whatever happens in Bangkok
stays in Bangkok.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.828
You wanna find garbage?
Go to a garbage dump.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.062
I look for three qualifications.

10:38.571 --> 10:42.405
They have to speak a little English,
they have to want to make money,

10:42.842 --> 10:45.970
and, above all they have
to be disposable.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.449
Do you wanna make some money?

10:52.418 --> 10:55.876
I have work in town.
I need some help.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.521
What work?

10:57.957 --> 11:00.050
Pick things up,
drop things off.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.693
Maybe some translation.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.724
About a month's work.
Two thousand a day.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.304
- Dollars.
- Baht.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.170
Bullshit. Huh.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.214
Five thousand, huh?
Forty five hundred.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.044
Four thousand.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.123
Two thousand, nine hundred
and fifty-two fifty, heh?

11:31.123 --> 11:32.784
What you, what you say?
Come on!

11:33.693 --> 11:35.991
We'll round up.
Three thousand.

11:36.228 --> 11:37.991
You get paid at the end of the week.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.388
No deal.

11:39.965 --> 11:40.933
Ah, oh, okay, okay.

11:40.933 --> 11:44.232
How about half, half now,
half at end of the week.

11:47.139 --> 11:48.401
What's your name?

11:48.741 --> 11:49.765
Kong.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.402
Kong?

11:56.449 --> 11:58.508
You can keep that in the wallet
you stole.

12:04.623 --> 12:07.285
You come alone,
or you don't get paid.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.026
Yes boss.

12:46.899 --> 12:49.026
- Take off the shades.
- Huh?

12:49.635 --> 12:51.466
Glasses. Off.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.204
Keep that with you at all times.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.314
- I have good phone.
- Now you have two.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.714
You answer whenever it rings.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.084
If I call and you don't answer,
you don't get paid.

13:16.061 --> 13:19.326
Time is very important.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.425
If I tell you to be somewhere

13:22.768 --> 13:25.999
and you are a minute late...

13:27.273 --> 13:28.831
you don't get paid.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.904
Do you understand?

13:31.443 --> 13:32.273
Birdshit foreigner

13:32.344 --> 13:34.471
- In English.
- I understand!

13:35.915 --> 13:37.405
You know the Caribbean club?

13:38.017 --> 13:39.118
High class ass.

13:39.118 --> 13:42.679
Ask for a dancer named Aom.
You give her this.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.347
You make sure the X is
facing up like this.

13:45.424 --> 13:47.289
She's gonna give you a package.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.489
Don't open it.

13:49.628 --> 13:50.560
What's in it?

13:50.729 --> 13:52.424
It doesn't concern you.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.359
Then you go pick it up.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.702
I'll find someone else.

13:56.702 --> 13:59.136
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I, I do it. I do it. I do it.

14:02.308 --> 14:03.935
You come straight back here.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.068
You don't stop for anything.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.835
What if I have to piss?

14:09.915 --> 14:13.043
If you ask me one more question...

14:13.118 --> 14:15.985
Then I won't get paid.
I know that.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.989
- Okay, I go now, ah?
- Hey!

14:23.295 --> 14:24.694
Take the cell phone.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.098
Duck fucker.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.175
Excuse me.
Which dancer is Aom?

15:12.544 --> 15:14.102
That one right there.

15:16.715 --> 15:17.909
Thank you very much.

15:55.554 --> 15:56.885
What do you want?

16:39.431 --> 16:40.659
Fuck a Duck!

17:04.356 --> 17:06.586
- You late, huh?
- Gimme the case.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.128
You don't get paid for today.

17:12.263 --> 17:14.289
- Why not?
- You ran from the police.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.858
You told me not to stop.
I, I do what you said.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.130
Don't stop, no stop for nothing,
not even for piss!

17:19.671 --> 17:22.138
From now on,
I don't want anymore police.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.339
You understand?

18:00.345 --> 18:04.008
The human face can mislead
in a thousand different ways.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.582
But the eyes never change.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.088
I was taught to start with the eyes.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.290
I'm Kong.

20:16.615 --> 20:17.707
Heroin?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.381
Give him what he needs.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.828
No, wait, wait, wait.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.306
The elephant.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.240
The ah, the nose, you see?

20:48.313 --> 20:51.646
Pointing down... bad luck.
No good.

20:52.651 --> 20:53.948
Bad luck for you.

20:54.653 --> 20:55.517
Goodnight.

23:20.365 --> 23:23.163
Yeah, I'm checking on
a wire transfer.

23:25.036 --> 23:30.201
Account code
six-five-one, four-three, four-six.

23:34.813 --> 23:35.780
Thank you.

24:14.252 --> 24:15.310
Hello...

24:15.420 --> 24:18.014
Uh... I have a a cut...

24:18.290 --> 24:20.918
and I need some medicine...

24:21.726 --> 24:23.057
disinfectant...

24:24.796 --> 24:26.229
Do you speak English?

25:12.477 --> 25:13.535
How many?

25:17.415 --> 25:18.609
Eh, one.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.681
In, oh, in the morning?
In the morning.

25:29.127 --> 25:30.253
One...

25:31.496 --> 25:32.929
Bef? before bed.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.439
Two hundred and fifty Bath, sir.

25:56.588 --> 25:57.919
Thank you.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.428
Oh, I have it.

26:32.857 --> 26:34.984
Excuse me.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.258
How much are these?

26:36.328 --> 26:38.455
Those are 20,000 Bath.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.732
20,000?

27:28.046 --> 27:29.411
I really love it

27:56.007 --> 27:57.702
Where's my money damn it?

28:55.633 --> 28:56.725
You're late.

28:57.001 --> 28:58.161
I'm sorry, boss.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.396
Don't be sorry.
Be on time.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.038
What happened to your face?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.844
Some ass holes tried,
tried to mug me.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.080
Like twenty of them.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.380
But I kicked their asses.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.220
I'm so sorry, boss.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.017
So sorry.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.753
They... they take...

29:27.432 --> 29:28.831
It's been opened.

29:29.534 --> 29:32.560
Not me. It's them.
They broke it.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.934
But I wouldn't let them have it.
I got it back for you.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.637
I don't let them have it.

29:42.647 --> 29:44.512
There's a beer in the refrigerator.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.140
It'll take down the swelling.

29:48.052 --> 29:49.178
Yes, boss.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.687
He's a bad man.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.284
Who?

29:59.130 --> 30:00.324
The man in the case.

30:00.698 --> 30:02.029
You're going to kill him?

30:10.008 --> 30:11.305
Can you teach me?

30:11.476 --> 30:13.535
- Teach you what?
- Everything.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.173
I could help you.

30:31.362 --> 30:32.351
Please?

30:35.700 --> 30:36.894
Show, show me.

31:12.503 --> 31:13.470
Again.

31:16.941 --> 31:17.737
Again.

31:19.244 --> 31:20.142
Again.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.610
Again.

31:26.351 --> 31:27.147
Again.

31:34.993 --> 31:35.925
Again.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.597
Good.

31:56.481 --> 31:57.948
That was your first lesson.

32:05.356 --> 32:06.983
Why didn't I kill him?

32:09.394 --> 32:10.827
Maybe it's because,

32:12.096 --> 32:13.859
and this is strange,

32:14.933 --> 32:17.766
somehow,
when I looked into his eyes,

32:18.670 --> 32:20.297
I saw myself,

32:22.407 --> 32:24.307
so I became his teacher.

32:25.009 --> 32:29.275
The best way to defend yourself is to know
when something's about to happen.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.773
So, you have to learn
to read your surroundings.

32:33.184 --> 32:34.981
See that man in the red jacket?

32:40.425 --> 32:41.414
What man?

32:49.600 --> 32:51.431
You're living in a city of mirrors.

32:51.502 --> 32:55.404
Store windows, glass office buildings,
polished steel,

32:56.607 --> 32:58.802
eyes in the back of your head.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.079
Aaah!

33:06.017 --> 33:07.985
Eyes in the back of my head, huh,
boss, huh?

33:08.152 --> 33:09.141
I got you now, boss.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.686
I'm not your boss.
I'm your teacher.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.482
So I call you

33:29.207 --> 33:30.367
How is he bad?

33:31.109 --> 33:32.041
This man?

33:33.644 --> 33:35.271
He hurts many country girls.

33:35.646 --> 33:38.911
From the north
He buys them from their parents?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.282
Same thing like devil,
ah, this guy.

33:49.060 --> 33:53.019
SHERATON HOTEL
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

36:59.517 --> 37:04.284
leader Pramod Juntasa was found dead
in his pool last night.

37:11.429 --> 37:14.990
Mother fucker,
he got what he deserved.

37:28.145 --> 37:29.703
How many people have you killed?

37:31.148 --> 37:32.547
I don't think about that.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.919
Do the police know who you are?

37:39.223 --> 37:43.216
No one knows who I am.
No one knows where I am.

37:45.663 --> 37:46.687
I know.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.234
- How many jobs in Bangkok?
- Four.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.809
Four. Two left.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.958
Um, I...

39:27.264 --> 39:28.663
Can you, can you help me?

39:28.733 --> 39:32.829
Could you tell her that I wanna
take her to dinner?

39:33.270 --> 39:34.760
Oh! Right.

40:20.951 --> 40:23.181
It's ah... hot.

40:38.002 --> 40:39.936
Tom Yam Kung

40:46.944 --> 40:48.172
That's just...

40:58.055 --> 40:59.317
Just eat it?

41:04.895 --> 41:06.328
It's cooling it down.

41:26.550 --> 41:29.610
It's hot again.
It's really hot.

41:34.391 --> 41:36.325
Ha, the whole thing.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.563
Yeah, that's better.

41:45.135 --> 41:46.124
Oooh!

42:01.385 --> 42:05.617
Now, you don't pull the trigger.
You squeeze it.

42:50.768 --> 42:52.292
- It's yours.
- Oh!

42:53.837 --> 42:55.702
Congratulations.

43:43.654 --> 43:46.179
It's best if he doesn't know us.

43:48.025 --> 43:50.960
But we should know more about him.

44:56.226 --> 44:57.921
Where? Where?

45:01.498 --> 45:02.624
Okay...

45:36.066 --> 45:37.897
- Boss?
- Yeah.

45:38.168 --> 45:41.262
I just left the club.
I think somebody's following me.

45:43.540 --> 45:46.532
Be at the Chao Praya ferry station
in twenty minutes.

45:46.744 --> 45:47.608
Okay, boss.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.770
- Wait for my call.
- Done, boss.

45:53.117 --> 45:54.709
Okay, listen carefully.

45:55.252 --> 45:58.653
Open the case.
Sixty-five, thirty-two, fifteen.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.156
You put the cell phone in the case,
and leave it.

46:01.225 --> 46:02.055
Got it.

46:17.908 --> 46:19.773
I found it first. Let go.

46:25.415 --> 46:28.976
- Give it to me.
- Let go. I found it first.

46:35.159 --> 46:36.922
I found it first.

46:50.574 --> 46:52.132
The case has returned.

47:13.197 --> 47:13.959
Yes.

47:14.231 --> 47:15.459
Put your boss on.

47:27.311 --> 47:28.039
Yes.

47:28.212 --> 47:29.679
We had an arrangement.

47:30.214 --> 47:33.479
If I see your people again,
I'll kill your wife.

47:42.593 --> 47:43.685
We'll try again.

48:27.571 --> 48:28.799
Thank you.

48:31.942 --> 48:34.308
Ah, you, what, what is your work?

48:34.444 --> 48:36.435
Oh... Ah... Ah, Banking.

48:40.951 --> 48:43.317
Bank. Banker?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.779
- Bank, banker, yes.
- Banker?

48:47.424 --> 48:50.188
He said he's a banker

49:53.957 --> 49:54.821
Rain.

50:00.697 --> 50:01.891
Rain.

50:04.668 --> 50:08.229
Is you?
Your, your name means rain?

50:09.840 --> 50:12.866
This is your name.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.832
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

51:53.977 --> 51:55.274
Floating Market?

51:55.545 --> 51:57.069
Where's Damnoen Saduak?

51:57.247 --> 52:00.273
Ratchaburi Province.
Hour and a half by car.

52:06.656 --> 52:07.850
Get some sleep.

52:09.359 --> 52:10.587
We leave early.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.015
Dock the boat up on the right.

54:08.511 --> 54:10.877
Hey, Mr... You buy something?
buy something?

54:25.428 --> 54:26.690
Get us out of here!

54:26.963 --> 54:28.021
Get us out!

54:32.736 --> 54:34.203
Dock the boat on the left.

54:36.573 --> 54:38.040
Come on. Faster. Hurry up!

56:32.255 --> 56:33.722
Get me over there!

57:17.167 --> 57:18.566
Fuck!

58:37.580 --> 58:38.808
Take it to the club.

58:40.717 --> 58:41.979
He's same like you, you know?

58:42.418 --> 58:44.909
- Who?
- This guy, in TV.

58:48.091 --> 58:50.958
He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

58:51.828 --> 58:53.125
Thai people love him.

58:55.965 --> 58:57.489
He's a very good man.

58:59.402 --> 59:01.870
Samle like you.

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:17.046
FIFTY COINS - FIFTY WISHES

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:46.326
I am happy together with you.

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:35.904
Four Know when it's time to get out.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.976
Three. Erase every trace.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:52.984
Boss?

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:59.723
Two... Don't take an interest
in people outside of work.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.208
One... Don't ask questions.

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.476
He's a very good man.

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.610
Same like you...

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.938
Political assassination wasn't in the contract.

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.207
So, there are two ways to go.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.540
Refuse the job and walk away now,

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:30.949
or, do the job and walk away rich.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:37.819
The truth is almost anyone one can take out a politician.

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.954
That's not the hard part.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.159
The hard part is getting away with it.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.377
He wants more money.

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:05.912
It's a big job. There's risk.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.517
Yes. He knows who we are.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.120
If he were caught,

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.123
it could lead back to us.

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.126
What about the messenger?

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:25.664
We should erase every link.

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:27.743
The girl too.

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.143
Just to be safe.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.346
I'll take care of it.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.553
- I'd better go.
- He can wait.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.691
He's counting on me.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:24.733
Kong!

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:31.265
Be here tomorrow at six P.M.

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:35.341
Last job?

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:37.143
Yeah.

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:39.676
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.411
See you tomorrow, boss.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.715
Call him. Or we do to your sister...

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:21.853
what we did to you.

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:27.460
Call.

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:48.813
Aom!

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.029
Kong!

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:16.838
Where is he staying?

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:28.386
Aom!

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:37.725
Tell me where he is staying.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.993
Or I'll cut her tits off.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:26.759
He fight bad guys and help the poor.

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:28.897
Thai people love him

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:41.960
When the nightmare becomes real,
you don't hesitate.

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:44.692
You don't think
You just run.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.160
Anyone in the way goes down.

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:50.138
It's pretty simple.
You are the target now.

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:52.698
Leave the country,
or you are going to die.

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:33.138
Where is Kong?

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:35.737
Where is Kong?

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:37.871
Why the fuck you care?

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:40.808
He's my student.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:46.949
Where is Kong?

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:49.952
Surat.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:52.621
He's with Surat.

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:59.290
...exactly which direction everybody's running
doesn't seem to be running away

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.433
Still no answer.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.835
Maybe he killed them.

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:09.975
He's only one man.

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:49.810
This is taking too long. When will he show up.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.833
There he is!

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.439
Let's go.

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:36.849
What's that noise?

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:48.869
Where is he? Do you see him?
I can't see anything.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.857
Kong, where is he?

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:51.495
I had to tell them.

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:01.307
Take her to the street.

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:03.366
I cleared the way.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.378
I got one more job.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:06.971
Surat?

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:09.307
He's very bad.

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:24.994
Don't wait. Just go.

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:32.391
Shoot him.

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:34.660
Shoot him.

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:52.818
Get off!
Go and fight!

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:54.011
Shoot him!

01:35:54.012 --> 01:35:55.013
