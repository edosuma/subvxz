00:20.486 --> 00:22.685
Why don't you go
to the European police?

00:22.687 --> 00:24.287
Because I think
it's one of you.

00:24.289 --> 00:25.688
I have a feeling
I'm gonna wish

00:25.690 --> 00:28.358
I never answered that call.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.861
I already do.

00:35.867 --> 00:37.500
<i>President Sherman</i>

00:37.502 --> 00:39.036
<i>is running his first
election campaign,</i>

00:39.038 --> 00:41.871

00:43.608 --> 00:45.808

<i>John Kilborn

<i>First Lady
Patricia Sherman</i>

<i>addressed delegates in Paris</i>

00:59.458 --> 01:01.024
<i>on behalf of
her husband's campaign.</i>

01:01.026 --> 01:04.461
I'm immensely proud
of our European Federation.

01:04.462 --> 01:07.363
We will use our fears to stay
the United States of Europe

01:07.365 --> 01:09.565
and become a stronger,
more peaceful order,

01:09.567 --> 01:11.735
as an example
to the rest of the world,

01:11.737 --> 01:14.538
something my husband wanted
for so long,

01:14.540 --> 01:15.775
to unite us all.

01:20.379 --> 01:22.479
<i>As far back
as I can recall,</i>

01:22.481 --> 01:23.380
<i>they've been at war.</i>

01:23.382 --> 01:25.949
<i>Codes established.</i>

01:25.951 --> 01:27.416
<i>Every so often,
something occurs</i>

01:27.418 --> 01:29.485
<i>to set off the balance,</i>

01:29.487 --> 01:31.755
<i>to tip the scales.</i>

01:31.757 --> 01:33.925
<i>This is where
it gets complicated.</i>

02:39.625 --> 02:42.895
Peace of God,
which passeth all understanding.

02:45.596 --> 02:49.768
Keep your hearts and minds in
the knowledge and love of God.

02:53.605 --> 02:56.540
Blessing of God Almighty,

02:56.542 --> 02:59.975
the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit,

02:59.977 --> 03:04.516
be amongst you
and remain with you always.

04:03.174 --> 04:04.510
It's time.

04:05.744 --> 04:07.480
<i>Bon app√©tit.</i>

04:39.978 --> 04:42.878
Hello, darling, it's me.
I'm delayed.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.649
He's late as usual.

04:45.651 --> 04:47.883
So, uh,
but do wait up for me.

04:47.885 --> 04:49.955
I love you very much.
Okay.

04:56.161 --> 04:59.094
Your wallet.

04:59.096 --> 05:01.130
On the hood. Now.

05:01.132 --> 05:02.298
Don't shoot.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.002
- Now!
- I'm getting it.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.077
Your Rolex also.

05:16.048 --> 05:17.550
Now the briefcase.

05:19.651 --> 05:21.650
Allow me to take out
the contents, at least.

05:21.652 --> 05:23.587
Briefcase on the hood.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.188
You know, I'm quite fond
of this suit,

05:25.190 --> 05:28.224
and I really don't think
you want to put a hole in it.

05:28.226 --> 05:29.962
Well, silver bullet
make big holes.

05:33.164 --> 05:34.664
Who are you?

05:34.666 --> 05:36.836
I know you.
Who are you?

05:47.878 --> 05:49.748
Sorry, Harry.
Nothing personal.

07:37.455 --> 07:39.354
Uncle Harry, how are you?

07:41.092 --> 07:43.392
- I've been shot.
- Good one!

07:43.394 --> 07:45.895
Auntie Emma catch you eating
before dinner again?

07:45.897 --> 07:49.733
This time...

07:49.735 --> 07:51.835
it's a silver bullet.

07:51.837 --> 07:53.303
What did you say?

07:53.305 --> 07:54.770
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

07:54.772 --> 07:57.039
Shh. It's Randall.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.210
- Rand... Randall Jackson?
- <i>Yes.</i>

08:00.212 --> 08:03.212
Now, listen to me...

08:03.214 --> 08:05.050
- <i>You know I love you.</i>
- Harry, where are you?

08:11.957 --> 08:13.091
Harry?

08:17.262 --> 08:18.495
Harry!

08:18.497 --> 08:20.496
Harry, stay with me!

08:20.498 --> 08:22.801
I'm coming to get you, Harry!
Stay there.

08:52.329 --> 08:54.197
Excuse me. Move. Move!

08:54.199 --> 08:57.332
Lieutenant Hunter!
Detective Hunter.

08:57.334 --> 08:59.202
Detective Hunter!

08:59.204 --> 09:00.305
Let her through.

09:07.278 --> 09:10.480
So, uh,
it's a mugging gone bad.

09:10.482 --> 09:13.219
No ID.
Wallet's missing.

09:16.821 --> 09:18.757
Got an anonymous tip.

09:20.492 --> 09:22.361
No ID on the shooter.

09:26.498 --> 09:28.501
Bastien!

09:29.868 --> 09:31.469
It's McGregor.

09:32.536 --> 09:34.169
What's she doing here?

09:34.171 --> 09:37.173
Private investigator
on my crime murder scene?

09:37.175 --> 09:39.074
Shouldn't you be out chasing

09:39.076 --> 09:41.144
some cheating wives
or husbands?

09:41.146 --> 09:43.545
The victim was Wolfe's uncle.

09:43.547 --> 09:46.481
Really? How interesting.

09:46.483 --> 09:47.616
You okay?

09:47.618 --> 09:50.186
Yeah. I've had better nights.

09:50.188 --> 09:53.590
Do you wanna tell me what
a presidential campaign manager

09:53.592 --> 09:56.592
was doing down here
at this time of night?

09:56.594 --> 09:58.995
I don't know, Lieutenant.

10:07.472 --> 10:10.305
I'm off to
Lieutenant McGregor's house.

10:10.307 --> 10:13.077
I'm sure I can find
a cheating wife there.

10:14.646 --> 10:16.448
Smart ass.

10:19.550 --> 10:22.150
What do we have? Gauge?

10:22.152 --> 10:23.186
Forty-five.

10:23.188 --> 10:24.356
Motive?

10:26.657 --> 10:29.192
I want a full autopsy done.

10:29.194 --> 10:31.430
Go through this
with a fine-tooth comb.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.404
Get that report first thing
in the morning, Bastien.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.108
Good job tonight.

10:44.342 --> 10:45.845
Blaze, come on.

10:50.547 --> 10:52.048
What do you think
is the difference

10:52.050 --> 10:53.482
between people and wolves?

10:53.484 --> 10:57.188
They're animals, silly.
I'm not an animal.

10:59.023 --> 11:01.024
Well, no, not like...

11:01.026 --> 11:03.058
Not the same as them, no.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.030
Like me...

11:07.431 --> 11:09.368
when I discovered...

11:11.268 --> 11:13.568
I had an animal inside of me.

11:13.570 --> 11:17.005
Maybe you will too.

11:17.007 --> 11:20.443
<i>Maybe you will discover
the animal inside of you.</i>

11:20.445 --> 11:22.180
<i>Understand?</i>

11:33.959 --> 11:36.491
<i>Ms. Wolfe?
The private investigator?</i>

11:36.493 --> 11:38.226
<i>My name is Jean Tesaud.</i>

11:38.228 --> 11:40.529
<i>I work for the First Lady,
Patricia Sherman.</i>

11:40.531 --> 11:42.164
Okay.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.399
<i>Ms. Sherman requests
a meeting with you</i>

11:44.401 --> 11:46.601
<i>at your residence or offices</i>

11:46.603 --> 11:48.371
<i>to discuss a matter.</i>

11:48.373 --> 11:50.573
May I ask
what this is regarding?

11:50.575 --> 11:52.475
<i>No. It's a private matter,</i>

11:52.477 --> 11:55.611
<i>and your every discretion
will be greatly appreciated.</i>

11:55.613 --> 11:57.215
I see.

12:21.105 --> 12:23.039
Please. Take a seat,
Mrs. Sherman.

12:23.041 --> 12:24.606
What can I help you with?

12:24.608 --> 12:26.742
- I want to hire you.
- For what?

12:26.744 --> 12:28.778
Someone wants to kill
my husband.

12:28.780 --> 12:31.983
He is the president, after all.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.419
The call asked
if we got the message.

12:37.421 --> 12:39.090
Harry.

12:40.691 --> 12:43.226
Why don't you go
to the European police?

12:43.228 --> 12:45.130
Because I think
it's one of you.

12:46.531 --> 12:48.231
By me, you mean...

12:48.233 --> 12:50.098
A werewolf.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.502
And what makes you so sure
it's one of us

12:53.504 --> 12:56.039
and not one of you?

12:56.041 --> 12:58.073
And by you, I mean vampire.

12:58.075 --> 13:01.244
Your kind are
a lot more vicious than us.

13:01.246 --> 13:02.381
And stronger.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.616
He said he knew
what my husband was.

13:07.618 --> 13:10.186
Why would a vamp marry a wolf?

13:10.188 --> 13:12.725
Because I love him.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.461
Both candidates wolves.

13:18.463 --> 13:20.399
If only the humans knew.

13:27.071 --> 13:32.243
Five thousand up front,
plus expenses.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.245
Here's ten.

13:36.247 --> 13:38.146
Come see me if you run out.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.348
Do you know Randall Jackson?

13:40.350 --> 13:42.651
No. Should I?

13:42.653 --> 13:44.587
He's one of my kind.

13:44.589 --> 13:46.489
Suspect?

13:46.491 --> 13:49.558
Yeah. He killed Harry.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.463
How do you know that?

13:53.765 --> 13:57.199
Money in the hand
always jars my memory.

13:57.201 --> 13:58.733
Do the police know about it?

13:58.735 --> 14:02.138
No, not yet.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.576
And I want to find him
before they do.

14:08.313 --> 14:10.746
Here's my private number.

14:10.748 --> 14:14.719
Call me if you just happen
to remember anything else.

14:22.392 --> 14:25.428
Does it burn you that we have
all the power in the Federation?

14:25.430 --> 14:27.395
You mean drunks or wolves?

14:27.397 --> 14:29.432
Wolves.

14:29.434 --> 14:33.135
<i>You're weak,
but stronger than the rest.</i>

14:33.137 --> 14:35.538
<i>You already have the desire.</i>

14:35.540 --> 14:37.673
<i>I'll give you
everything you need.</i>

14:37.675 --> 14:39.475
<i>We're not doing this.</i>

14:39.477 --> 14:42.211
<i>Get out of my head.</i>

14:42.213 --> 14:45.117
<i>Fine.
Please keep me updated.</i>

14:48.685 --> 14:51.419
<i>Vamps and humans
never bother me.</i>

14:51.421 --> 14:53.188
<i>Nothing much does.</i>

14:53.190 --> 14:54.890
<i>But Harry's dead,</i>

14:54.892 --> 14:56.424
<i>and I've got
the president's wife</i>

14:56.426 --> 14:58.760
<i>asking me to figure out
who it was.</i>

14:58.762 --> 15:02.198
<i>I think I'm gonna regret
ever answering that call.</i>

15:02.200 --> 15:03.868
<i>I already do.</i>

15:09.440 --> 15:13.442
<i>They seem to have no idea
about who runs their city.</i>

15:13.444 --> 15:16.578
<i>Decisive vote for apathy.</i>

15:16.580 --> 15:19.182
<i>I think they know.</i>

15:19.184 --> 15:20.582
<i>The werewolves and vampires</i>

15:20.584 --> 15:22.684
<i>accept their support
graciously,</i>

15:22.686 --> 15:25.254
<i>and that graciousness
is all they ask in return</i>

15:25.256 --> 15:26.257
<i>for compliance.</i>

15:36.901 --> 15:38.733
Hey! How about
some service in here

15:38.735 --> 15:39.869
whilst I'm still a pup?

15:39.871 --> 15:41.440
What?

15:44.408 --> 15:47.242
You got a problem, bub?

15:47.244 --> 15:50.181
Yeah. This place is a dump.

15:52.749 --> 15:55.250
Missed you, Frank.

15:55.252 --> 15:58.254
Ah, my little Wolfie-wolf.

15:58.256 --> 16:00.590
How come you don't
come around no more?

16:00.592 --> 16:03.693
Your old lady threatened to
hurt me if I ever came back.

16:03.695 --> 16:07.462
I believe the exact term
was "spay."

16:07.464 --> 16:10.298
She's always been
the jealous type.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.336
Want your usual?
Hair of the Wolf?

16:13.338 --> 16:16.675
Your jokes are worse
than her spaying.

16:17.941 --> 16:19.774
Sorry about Harry.

16:19.776 --> 16:22.680
He was a class act.

16:23.915 --> 16:27.750
Another wolf has passed on!

16:27.752 --> 16:29.518
Raise 'em!

16:39.564 --> 16:40.829
You seen Randall?

16:40.831 --> 16:43.301
Don't tell me it was him.

16:44.701 --> 16:46.804
Son of bitch!

16:49.273 --> 16:51.707
Wolves killing wolves.

16:51.709 --> 16:54.010
What's the world coming to?

16:54.012 --> 16:56.444
I need to find him.

16:56.446 --> 16:57.916
I'll make a call.

17:00.517 --> 17:01.820
Help yourself.

17:04.321 --> 17:06.625
Try not to get Frank
into trouble.

17:08.759 --> 17:11.294
<i>Where are you?
Where are they in this city?</i>

17:11.296 --> 17:14.530
<i>I'll find you.
I can smell you.</i>

17:14.531 --> 17:17.932
<i>I know you're there behind
a corner and inside a sewer.</i>

17:17.934 --> 17:19.935
<i>I'll track you down
and make you writhe</i>

17:19.936 --> 17:21.970
<i>whilst I extract your veins.</i>

17:21.972 --> 17:24.773
<i>I'll drink your sap,
while you beg me to stop,</i>

17:24.776 --> 17:26.508
<i>and I won't,</i>

17:26.510 --> 17:29.411
<i>but I'll enjoy every second
of the hunt.</i>

17:29.413 --> 17:32.648
<i>Most of all, the moments
before I bite down on you.</i>

17:32.650 --> 17:34.419
<i>And the first rip.</i>

17:52.503 --> 17:54.570
You know, Kristy,

17:54.572 --> 17:58.407
if you don't really understand
the wolf inside of you,

17:58.409 --> 18:01.509
the animal inside of you,

18:01.511 --> 18:06.948
the problem is someday
you might not remember

18:06.950 --> 18:09.884
what you were doing

18:09.886 --> 18:11.989
when that side of you
is in control.

19:41.711 --> 19:44.513
Our top story today,
President Richard Sherman

19:44.515 --> 19:46.649
continues with
his reelection campaign,

19:46.651 --> 19:48.650
addressing the media
at Parliament.

19:48.652 --> 19:51.053
Sherman and his team noted
that they will soldier on

19:51.055 --> 19:54.457
after his campaign manager,
Harry Goldstone, was found dead.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.759
Killing Harry
wasn't part of the plan.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.528
Don't quote me the code.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.163
Wolves don't kill wolves?

20:02.165 --> 20:03.799
A shocking development
from Saint-Gilles.

20:03.801 --> 20:05.167
We have reports coming in now

20:05.169 --> 20:07.035
that a number of bodies
have been found

20:07.037 --> 20:08.938
at the city's largest park.

20:08.940 --> 20:11.506
Police are on hand
and investigating this latest

20:11.508 --> 20:12.842
in a series of gruesome attacks.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.777
Let's split up
the fucking money now.

20:15.779 --> 20:18.450
When are we getting paid?

20:19.917 --> 20:22.951
Two nights from now.

20:22.953 --> 20:24.620
On the 25th.

20:24.622 --> 20:26.788
Keep the cops busy.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.594
Hit two parks
on your way home.

20:37.501 --> 20:39.901
Lock him up!

20:39.903 --> 20:41.736
I didn't do anything.

20:41.738 --> 20:45.541
Nobody ever does anything!
You're going to jail, son!

20:45.543 --> 20:47.909
President Sherman
was in Brussels today,

20:47.911 --> 20:51.679
speaking to an auditorium of
select international journalists

20:51.681 --> 20:54.216
at the at the Western European
Nations Summit.

20:54.218 --> 20:58.120
Harry Goldstone
was a friend

20:58.122 --> 21:01.957
and political confidant
for my entire career.

21:01.959 --> 21:03.758
<i>His service
to the Federation...</i>

21:03.760 --> 21:07.062
Ah, Bastien, have a seat.

21:07.064 --> 21:10.865
Yeah, just in time
for the president's speech

21:10.867 --> 21:14.536
about his
dead campaign manager.

21:14.538 --> 21:16.237
The debate will go on.

21:16.239 --> 21:18.075
That's the way
Harry would want it.

21:19.677 --> 21:22.844
Hmm.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.746
The person who, um,

21:24.748 --> 21:26.814
who knows me better
than anyone else,

21:26.816 --> 21:29.951
the person
that I trust the most.

21:29.953 --> 21:33.022
And, of course,
Frederik Forsythe,

21:33.024 --> 21:35.823
our lawyer and friends.

21:35.825 --> 21:39.762
Ah, Blaze! Pull up a chair.
Nice of you to join us.

21:39.764 --> 21:41.063
Forensics.

21:41.065 --> 21:43.165
Ah, forensics.

21:43.167 --> 21:46.869
The bullets were silver.

21:46.871 --> 21:50.573
Silver is silver,
gold is gold.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.111
Dead... is dead!

21:54.911 --> 21:58.112
President's office
breathing down my neck!

21:58.114 --> 22:00.282
They want answers,
and they want them now.

22:00.284 --> 22:02.884
His campaign manager is dead,

22:02.886 --> 22:04.852
and he has an election
coming up!

22:04.854 --> 22:08.990
So I want you and you
on the streets.

22:08.992 --> 22:10.292
Turn over every stone.

22:10.294 --> 22:12.727
Ask every single question
possible

22:12.729 --> 22:14.295
and come back with answers.

22:14.297 --> 22:17.365
I need answers.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.967
What do I need, Blaze?

22:18.969 --> 22:21.169
- Answers.
- That's right.

22:21.171 --> 22:23.005
Go.

22:23.007 --> 22:24.672
I told you. Be careful.

22:24.674 --> 22:26.274
Things are gonna get
a lot tougher.

22:26.276 --> 22:29.745
I know you said this,
but we both hated him.

22:29.747 --> 22:33.314
We know he could never
take the next step.

22:33.316 --> 22:36.185
Harry had to go.
I know that.

22:36.187 --> 22:38.887
So let's speak about
something else.

22:38.889 --> 22:40.255
Something better.

22:40.257 --> 22:43.292
I always hated Frank.

22:43.294 --> 22:45.861
- Well, it's all done now.
- Good.

22:45.863 --> 22:49.230
Listen, they aren't even human.

22:49.232 --> 22:50.734
You have to be careful.

22:52.202 --> 22:55.839
They don't care about life.

23:14.091 --> 23:16.891
I've dropped in the polls.

23:16.893 --> 23:19.128
Gotta dump this
Free Energy program.

23:19.130 --> 23:20.829
It isn't working
with the voters.

23:20.831 --> 23:22.997
Matthew, we're from
different parties,

23:22.999 --> 23:25.266
but we've made
this administration work.

23:25.268 --> 23:29.204
I appreciate dissent,
but let's remain constructive.

23:29.206 --> 23:30.773
Yes, but I don't think
you realize

23:30.775 --> 23:32.041
the enemies you're making
with this plan.

23:32.043 --> 23:33.374
Patricia and I are determined.

23:33.376 --> 23:34.842
Can't we leave Patricia
out of this?

23:34.844 --> 23:36.277
I wouldn't underestimate
Patricia.

23:36.279 --> 23:37.845
As long as you don't
overestimate her.

23:37.847 --> 23:39.348
Keep her in her place.

23:39.350 --> 23:44.186
Her place is on my side,
and on my other side is you.

23:44.188 --> 23:47.456
Only one of you is replaceable
in the upcoming election.

23:47.458 --> 23:50.292
- Understand?
- Excuse me, Mr. President.

23:50.294 --> 23:51.994
I've gotta take this call.

23:51.996 --> 23:54.263
I don't trust him.

23:54.265 --> 23:55.964
Do you?

23:55.966 --> 23:57.235
No.

24:21.357 --> 24:23.391
<i>First Lady Patricia Sherman
took the stage</i>

24:23.393 --> 24:25.960
<i>at the International States
Business Summit.</i>

24:25.962 --> 24:27.862
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

24:27.864 --> 24:29.497
<i>As the President
has mentioned his new plan,</i>

24:29.499 --> 24:32.200
<i>where do you fall
in the economic debate?</i>

24:32.202 --> 24:33.901
<i>The proposed
Energy for All program</i>

24:33.903 --> 24:35.336
<i>shows that our president
embraces progress.</i>

24:35.338 --> 24:37.105
<i>And I'm behind him 100%.</i>

24:37.107 --> 24:39.140
<i>What role do you see
the President taking on</i>

24:39.142 --> 24:41.043
<i>for the next three years,
if reelected,</i>

24:41.045 --> 24:43.812
<i>in terms of assisting
Federation nation states?</i>

24:43.814 --> 24:45.413
<i>The people know we've made
tremendous strides</i>

24:45.415 --> 24:47.448
<i>in our first term.</i>

24:47.450 --> 24:50.185
<i>We trust that they'll want
to see the job gets finished.</i>

24:50.187 --> 24:52.353
<i>However, right now,</i>

24:52.355 --> 24:55.093
<i>we would like to send our love
to Harry's family.</i>

24:58.394 --> 25:00.097
<i>Our condolences are with them.</i>

25:02.767 --> 25:06.001
<i>They're hidden.
Waiting for me.</i>

25:06.003 --> 25:08.871
<i>Awake all hours of the night.</i>

25:08.873 --> 25:11.105
<i>But I'll outlast them.</i>

25:11.107 --> 25:13.809
<i>Separate them from the pack.</i>

25:13.811 --> 25:18.280
<i>And then give them
what Harry would otherwise.</i>

25:18.282 --> 25:20.149
<i>What if there's ten?</i>

25:20.151 --> 25:22.817
<i>Hmmph. All the better.</i>

25:22.819 --> 25:24.421
<i>Ten it would be.</i>

26:15.538 --> 26:16.775
Harry told me.

27:05.488 --> 27:07.089
<i>Asked how the death
of their campaign manager</i>

27:07.091 --> 27:08.590
<i>would affect current plans,</i>

27:08.592 --> 27:10.592
<i>both Richard
and Patricia Sherman</i>

27:10.594 --> 27:12.326
<i>echoed that
Frederik Forsythe...</i>

27:12.328 --> 27:15.596
Look what I found.
It's important.

27:15.598 --> 27:18.368
<i>...strategy and policy
for the administration.</i>

27:33.116 --> 27:34.351
You again?

27:45.362 --> 27:48.130
Must be a big day.

27:48.132 --> 27:49.968
The 21st.

27:51.969 --> 27:54.402
Does it mean anything to you?

27:54.404 --> 27:56.537
No idea, Lieutenant.

27:56.539 --> 28:00.508
I find out you're lying,
which I think you are,

28:00.510 --> 28:05.112
or I find out that you're
holding back information,

28:05.114 --> 28:07.149
I'm throwin' you in jail.

28:07.151 --> 28:10.319
And I'm doin' you
for obstruction!

28:10.321 --> 28:14.255
I see that private detective
license of yours.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.992
I'm gonna wipe my ass
with it.

28:16.994 --> 28:18.663
Enjoy doing that.

28:26.569 --> 28:28.269
<i>They're like rats.</i>

28:28.271 --> 28:30.706
<i>They hunt for food,
live in colonies,</i>

28:30.708 --> 28:32.975
<i>fight for warmth.</i>

28:32.977 --> 28:35.142
<i>They have alphas.</i>

28:35.144 --> 28:38.045
<i>They appoint kings and queens
to keep order,</i>

28:38.047 --> 28:40.482
<i>so they can keep looking
for their comforts.</i>

28:40.484 --> 28:44.085
<i>Their entire existence is
built around food and warmth.</i>

28:44.087 --> 28:45.987
<i>There's no difference.</i>

28:45.989 --> 28:50.191
<i>They just delude themselves
with imagined complexity.</i>

28:50.193 --> 28:52.361
<i>Harry Goldstone
was honored today</i>

28:52.363 --> 28:54.729
<i>at funeral services
in Ixelles.</i>

28:54.731 --> 28:57.332
<i>The president's
long-time speechwriter</i>

28:57.334 --> 29:00.235
<i>was shot and killed
in an apparent robbery</i>

29:00.237 --> 29:02.172
<i>at the Gare du Nord last week.</i>

29:33.636 --> 29:35.603
I really didn't want to have
this conversation

29:35.605 --> 29:37.371
at the funeral.

29:37.373 --> 29:39.043
I understand.

29:41.311 --> 29:45.714
So did you know
what Harry was?

29:45.716 --> 29:47.986
A good politician?

29:50.153 --> 29:52.486
Oh, my God. Good Lord,
are you one of them too?

29:52.488 --> 29:55.489
How many of them
are in your family?

29:55.491 --> 29:57.124
Enough to keep you guessing.

29:57.126 --> 29:59.361
And I suggest
you keep this to yourself.

29:59.363 --> 30:01.830
Oh, yeah? Am I being threatened
by an actual bitch?

30:01.832 --> 30:02.767
Hah!

30:04.267 --> 30:06.601
That's dogs, Wauters.

30:06.603 --> 30:09.204
Not wolves.

30:09.206 --> 30:12.140
I only wanted to get
Harry's killers to justice.

30:12.142 --> 30:13.207
Why?

30:13.209 --> 30:14.708
Why? It's good for business.

30:14.710 --> 30:16.178
It's better for the city.

30:16.180 --> 30:17.411
There's been enough killings.

30:17.413 --> 30:21.216
And besides,
Harry was my friend.

30:21.218 --> 30:23.685
Well, Mr. Vice President,

30:23.687 --> 30:27.458
There's all forms of justice,
isn't there?

30:44.341 --> 30:46.341
I understand this happens,

30:46.343 --> 30:48.813
but I just don't want it
to happen again.

30:51.848 --> 30:56.884
Do you have any idea
who recommended Wolfe

30:56.886 --> 30:58.687
for this investigation?

31:05.796 --> 31:07.398
Hey! Kristy!

31:09.732 --> 31:11.134
Need a lift?

32:13.729 --> 32:15.863
<i>Tomorrow will be
the final presidential debate</i>

32:15.865 --> 32:17.932
<i>between President Sherman
and John Kilborn.</i>

32:17.934 --> 32:19.700
<i>This is one of
the most contested...</i>

32:19.702 --> 32:23.840
Looks like we'll have ourselves
a new president soon.

32:27.911 --> 32:29.910
You weren't checking
on Randall Jackson

32:29.912 --> 32:31.915
for alimony, were you?

32:34.284 --> 32:36.217
Randall killed Harry.

32:36.219 --> 32:39.653
Does anything connect
to Eddelman?

32:39.655 --> 32:42.323
Come on.

32:42.325 --> 32:44.592
Just because you're a PI,
and I'm police,

32:44.594 --> 32:47.531
doesn't mean we can't
work together.

32:49.766 --> 32:53.334
When I confronted Randall,
he had a bag full of money.

32:53.336 --> 32:56.438
Eddelman's rich enough.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.407
Randall had C4 as well.

32:59.409 --> 33:01.245
He's a shooter and a bomber.

33:02.813 --> 33:05.546
Anything else
you are not telling me?

33:05.548 --> 33:07.350
No.

33:26.469 --> 33:28.870
What could be this urgent,
Eddelman?

33:28.872 --> 33:30.705
The debate is in four hours.

33:30.707 --> 33:33.344
Trust me. It's worth it.

33:41.718 --> 33:44.652
How did you get this?

33:44.654 --> 33:46.487
Irrelevant.

33:48.057 --> 33:50.592
All you need to know...

33:50.594 --> 33:54.565
is the debate is in the bag,
Mr. Kilborn.

35:04.401 --> 35:06.634
A series of polls show
that the debate went hands-down

35:06.636 --> 35:08.002
to challenger John Kilborn.

35:08.004 --> 35:09.471
He seemed to have
all the answers

35:09.473 --> 35:10.871
to the moderator's questions,

35:10.873 --> 35:12.940
as well as
President Sherman's rebuttals.

35:12.942 --> 35:14.942
It appeared the president
was rattled at times

35:14.944 --> 35:17.478
and perhaps because he was not
as prepared as he might've been,

35:17.480 --> 35:20.750
without his trusted strategist,
Harry Goldstone.

35:33.129 --> 35:36.730
<i>I can't get a lead
on Randall or Mason.</i>

35:36.732 --> 35:39.933
<i>Trail's gone cold.</i>

35:39.935 --> 35:42.672
<i>Come on, come on, think!</i>

35:44.808 --> 35:47.542
<i>Who would want my uncle dead?</i>

35:47.544 --> 35:49.411
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

35:49.413 --> 35:52.480
<i>Who is Randall working for?</i>

35:52.482 --> 35:54.815
<i>Who would know about us?</i>

35:54.817 --> 35:57.018
<i>Something doesn't add up.</i>

35:57.020 --> 35:58.853
<i>Someone out there knows.</i>

36:04.428 --> 36:06.029
<i>Copy that. We're in position.</i>

36:13.636 --> 36:16.640
<i>Okay, 4-0-1,
we have eyes on the limo.</i>

36:17.940 --> 36:20.908
Glad you agreed to meet.

36:20.910 --> 36:24.712
I know how unusual a request
this is.

36:24.714 --> 36:26.580
My vice president

36:26.582 --> 36:29.919
has been pushing
for this meeting for a while.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.855
Your boy did well
at the debate.

36:33.857 --> 36:36.757
What can I say?

36:36.759 --> 36:39.726
Kilborn played well.

36:39.728 --> 36:42.165
It's easy to play, if you've got
the right sheet music.

36:44.201 --> 36:46.000
Harry was our friend.

36:46.002 --> 36:48.636
Patricia, please.

36:48.638 --> 36:52.410
Mr. Eddelman's a businessman,
not a murderer.

36:53.977 --> 36:56.710
He's only trying to help.

36:56.712 --> 37:00.982
I had nothing to do
with Harry's murder.

37:00.984 --> 37:02.984
And you...

37:02.986 --> 37:04.786
don't be a sore loser.

37:04.788 --> 37:08.656
Kilborn is ahead in the polls,

37:08.658 --> 37:10.058
and you are going to lose.

37:10.060 --> 37:11.826
Are you suggesting
some type of deal?

37:11.828 --> 37:15.830
You bow out gracefully next week
due to illness,

37:15.832 --> 37:18.565
and I cut you in
on a huge share of my profits

37:18.567 --> 37:23.136
from my deal
with EFF's new pipeline.

37:23.138 --> 37:24.739
That's insane.

37:24.741 --> 37:26.975
Why would I do that?
I can still win.

37:26.977 --> 37:30.712
Richard, be reasonable.

37:30.714 --> 37:32.980
You don't want
European Fossil Fuels

37:32.982 --> 37:34.549
as an enemy.

37:34.551 --> 37:37.018
If you think that I...

37:37.020 --> 37:39.520
Let's hear him out.

37:39.522 --> 37:44.091
You've thrown away
a lot of money on this campaign.

37:44.093 --> 37:46.294
I'm just looking out for us.

37:46.296 --> 37:49.096
The pipeline money
would be a godsend

37:49.098 --> 37:50.797
politically and financially.

37:50.799 --> 37:53.201
Hey, want a light?

37:53.203 --> 37:54.835
You've certainly
thought this through.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.670
Politics is like poker.

37:56.672 --> 37:58.772
You win when you cover
all the angles.

37:58.774 --> 38:01.109
And I always win.

38:01.111 --> 38:03.681
All you have to do is say yes.

38:06.082 --> 38:07.084
What the hell?

38:11.754 --> 38:13.321
Got a question for you.

38:13.323 --> 38:14.755
I've nothing to say to you.

38:14.757 --> 38:16.924
How many people
did you kill today?

38:16.926 --> 38:18.761
Fuck you!

38:24.134 --> 38:27.768
Your uncle was killed because he
was wrapped up in bad business.

38:27.770 --> 38:29.603
Do you think this is a game?

38:29.605 --> 38:32.005
Harry's dead,
and you're linked to it.

38:32.007 --> 38:33.741
And you two...

38:33.743 --> 38:36.044
If I find out you had anything
to do with his death,

38:36.046 --> 38:38.248
I'll rip your throats out!

38:45.187 --> 38:47.922
Take care of her tonight!

38:47.924 --> 38:50.824
Solve my problem...

38:50.826 --> 38:52.562
and win!

39:42.645 --> 39:44.281
Just being paranoid.

40:30.093 --> 40:32.859
You're distant.
What's going on?

40:32.861 --> 40:34.127
Hello!

40:34.129 --> 40:37.998
- What? Did I do it again?
- Yes.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.199
Sorry.

40:39.201 --> 40:41.201
I'm here!

40:41.203 --> 40:46.239
So talk to me. How are you?
What's going on?

40:46.241 --> 40:48.208
I wanted to ask you something.

40:48.210 --> 40:51.946
There's a guy called Colin
I'm trying to track down.

40:51.948 --> 40:54.281
Heard a lot of good things
about him.

40:54.283 --> 40:55.750
Do you know him?

40:55.752 --> 40:57.250
It's been a long time.

40:57.252 --> 40:58.819
So you know him.

40:58.821 --> 41:00.855
The name doesn't
mean anything to you?

41:00.857 --> 41:04.257
No, I... I've never
heard of him before.

41:04.259 --> 41:07.761
He conjures up potions
for people.

41:07.763 --> 41:09.096
Potions?

41:09.098 --> 41:11.165
Powerful potions.

41:11.167 --> 41:15.038
Wait. Do I need to be careful?
Is he dangerous?

41:18.006 --> 41:20.107
It might be
for you to find out.

41:20.109 --> 41:22.743
Where is he based?

41:22.745 --> 41:25.815
I only know
he was based in Rome.

43:08.084 --> 43:09.486
Evening, sir.

43:19.928 --> 43:22.098
Colin Haroosen.

43:27.536 --> 43:30.274
I was told to come and see you.

43:35.879 --> 43:37.980
Am I in the right place?

43:40.549 --> 43:42.486
I believe you're lost,
young lady.

43:43.553 --> 43:45.585
Really? Games?

43:45.587 --> 43:48.589
You know who I am.

43:48.591 --> 43:50.027
Perhaps.

43:52.527 --> 43:54.263
Towel, sir.

44:00.203 --> 44:02.139
I need to get back.

44:04.339 --> 44:06.473
Enjoy.

44:06.475 --> 44:08.509
<i>I need your help.</i>

44:08.511 --> 44:10.411
<i>Why the hell
would I help you?</i>

44:10.413 --> 44:13.147
<i>Because my Uncle Harry
was murdered last week,</i>

44:13.149 --> 44:15.319
<i>and I'm gonna find out
who did it.</i>

44:18.154 --> 44:19.089
Follow me.

44:30.332 --> 44:32.466
I need a potion.

44:32.468 --> 44:34.634
That's not my thing.

44:34.636 --> 44:38.105
Harry Goldstone was my uncle.

44:38.107 --> 44:41.141
He was killed last week.

44:41.143 --> 44:42.879
I need your help.

44:46.683 --> 44:50.087
You need to leave.

44:51.587 --> 44:54.391
My uncle thought
very highly of you.

44:57.694 --> 45:00.393
I have five thousand in cash.

45:00.395 --> 45:03.596
Five thousand?
Are you kidding?

45:03.598 --> 45:06.667
I'm dealing with
some very unpleasant people.

45:06.669 --> 45:08.669
That's your problem.

45:08.671 --> 45:11.408
Well, I'm about to make it
our problem.

45:20.149 --> 45:22.319
I'll call when ready.

45:40.602 --> 45:43.737
<i>What is this place?</i>

45:43.739 --> 45:46.640
<i>The kind of place
where no one bothers you.</i>

45:46.642 --> 45:49.009
<i>Too radioactive
for humans?</i>

45:49.011 --> 45:51.511
<i>Yeah. Too toxic.</i>

45:51.513 --> 45:53.346
<i>Did you think over
what I asked about?</i>

45:53.348 --> 45:54.781
<i>I did.</i>

45:54.783 --> 45:57.250
<i>I have someone
who's hired me.</i>

45:57.252 --> 46:01.087
<i>I know who hired you.
I hear her here.</i>

46:01.089 --> 46:02.323
<i>And what do you hear?</i>

46:02.325 --> 46:04.158
<i>All kind of things.</i>

46:04.160 --> 46:06.159
<i>And?</i>

46:06.161 --> 46:08.029
<i>I have nothing
to say about it.</i>

46:08.031 --> 46:10.196
<i>Do you have it for me?</i>

46:10.198 --> 46:11.799
<i>For your uncle's sake,</i>

46:11.801 --> 46:14.368
<i>in two days,
I'll have something for you.</i>

46:14.370 --> 46:16.569
<i>And she won't be able
to get in your head.</i>

46:16.571 --> 46:19.239
<i>No one will for 18 days.</i>

46:19.241 --> 46:21.509
<i>Thanks.
We'll speak soon.</i>

46:21.511 --> 46:22.980
<i>I hope so.</i>

49:07.343 --> 49:09.643
Come here often?

49:09.645 --> 49:11.679
Too dreary for my taste.

49:11.681 --> 49:12.782
Following me?

49:13.882 --> 49:15.583
Coincidence.

49:15.585 --> 49:18.886
I don't believe in them.

49:18.888 --> 49:22.989
I'm here paying my respects.
Just a coincidence.

49:22.991 --> 49:25.629
You don't strike me
as the sympathetic type.

49:27.529 --> 49:29.230
He was my favorite.

49:29.232 --> 49:30.663
Husband?

49:30.665 --> 49:32.201
Lover.

49:37.272 --> 49:39.739
The one that got away?

49:39.741 --> 49:40.975
Not quite.

49:40.977 --> 49:42.542
So?

49:42.544 --> 49:44.245
We were making love and...

49:44.247 --> 49:47.384
I get the picture. And?

49:49.718 --> 49:52.652
What brings you here?

49:52.654 --> 49:54.788
Gathering my wits.

49:54.790 --> 49:57.524
Fear doesn't become you, Wolfe.

49:57.526 --> 50:00.661
What have you told
Detective Bastien?

50:00.663 --> 50:02.596
I thought you said
you weren't following me.

50:02.598 --> 50:05.699
I'm not, but I have
my own resources.

50:05.701 --> 50:07.368
Well?

50:07.370 --> 50:10.904
He thinks my story about Harry
doesn't add up.

50:10.906 --> 50:13.574
Lieutenant McGregor
is gunning for me now.

50:13.576 --> 50:16.844
You need to be a better liar.

50:16.846 --> 50:19.045
The stakes are a lot higher now.

50:19.047 --> 50:21.315
You should be careful
what you tell others

50:21.317 --> 50:23.652
that don't have
our best interests in mind.

50:25.353 --> 50:27.353
Do you have anything
you want to share with me?

50:27.355 --> 50:29.723
Right now? No.

50:29.725 --> 50:32.493
I'm just trying
to make sense of everything.

50:32.495 --> 50:34.828
Be careful
of the European police.

50:34.830 --> 50:36.763
It's not that they have
bad intentions,

50:36.765 --> 50:38.998
but they just don't know
the whole situation.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.335
I can handle it.

50:41.337 --> 50:43.437
How have you been holding up?

50:43.439 --> 50:45.438
Does not having Harry here
affect your plan?

50:45.440 --> 50:48.808
Not having Harry makes
everything a lot harder.

50:48.810 --> 50:50.810
He was a good friend to me.

50:50.812 --> 50:52.879
He was someone I could trust.

50:52.881 --> 50:55.784
Now you're that someone
I can trust.

50:57.953 --> 50:59.920
Don't let me down, Wolfe.

50:59.922 --> 51:01.524
I'm on it.

51:07.395 --> 51:08.696
Hi.

51:08.698 --> 51:12.065
<i>Are you holding up
your end of the deal?</i>

51:12.067 --> 51:13.866
I'm working on it.

51:13.868 --> 51:15.969
<i>You haven't done
what you said you would do.</i>

51:15.971 --> 51:18.004
<i>I've been patient.</i>

51:18.006 --> 51:20.507
<i>Je sais.</i>
You have to understand.

51:20.509 --> 51:24.578
I want everyone to be realistic.
Don't shoot the messenger.

51:24.580 --> 51:28.681
<i>We want the energy initiative
off the table. Dead.</i>

51:28.683 --> 51:31.484
<i>That is your only choice.</i>

51:31.486 --> 51:33.821
<i>Off the table or dead.</i>

51:33.823 --> 51:36.089
Yes.

51:36.091 --> 51:38.958
<i>We want to keep you
in the game.</i>

51:38.960 --> 51:42.429
<i>You've been very useful.</i>

51:45.968 --> 51:48.534
<i>Before you embark
on a journey of revenge,</i>

51:48.536 --> 51:50.473
<i>dig two graves.</i>

51:53.609 --> 51:56.513
<i>I don't have to dig mine
just yet.</i>

53:07.783 --> 53:12.886
Randall hangs out
with two mangy mutts.

53:12.888 --> 53:16.190
Mason and Armand.

53:16.192 --> 53:20.063
This is Armand's
last known address.

53:22.531 --> 53:24.565
I bet those two
are behind the park murders,

53:24.567 --> 53:26.232
a distraction
for the European police,

53:26.234 --> 53:28.034
to keep them off
Harry's murder case.

53:28.036 --> 53:30.136
If I hear anything,
I'll call you.

53:30.138 --> 53:33.774
Word is even the vamps
are getting anxious.

53:33.776 --> 53:36.176
Those bastards!

53:36.178 --> 53:38.745
They're ready to kill
any one of us,

53:38.747 --> 53:41.013
just to keep things in peace,

53:41.015 --> 53:45.821
so watch your tail
out there, Wolfie.

53:51.593 --> 53:53.826
<i>Who's the top of this pyramid?</i>

53:53.828 --> 53:55.828
<i>I want to know everything.</i>

53:55.830 --> 53:58.931
<i>Not you, but you're a problem.</i>

53:58.933 --> 54:00.199
<i>We'll fix that.</i>

54:00.201 --> 54:02.935
<i>This is for Harry,</i>

54:02.937 --> 54:04.873
<i>but I won't end this
so quickly.</i>

54:42.076 --> 54:44.678
Shh.

54:44.680 --> 54:47.683
I like a midnight snack
before I go to bed.

55:05.033 --> 55:07.669
You like that?
You like that?

55:13.274 --> 55:14.510
Shh.

55:25.853 --> 55:29.922
Shh, shh, try to relax.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

55:53.649 --> 55:56.283
I thought you might need
a little help.

55:56.285 --> 55:59.685
Thanks, Frank.
If Mary knew you were here,

55:59.687 --> 56:01.754
she might try to finish
what Armand started.

56:01.756 --> 56:03.723
Nah.

56:03.725 --> 56:09.129
She'd cut out your ovaries
with a rusty butcher knife.

56:12.935 --> 56:14.967
Ah.

56:14.969 --> 56:16.870
He'd been bitten.

56:16.872 --> 56:18.304
If you leave him...

56:18.306 --> 56:20.743
It's humane, I know.

56:26.281 --> 56:28.250
I'll put Armand in my truck.

56:32.020 --> 56:34.754
Bring him out
when you're full.

56:34.756 --> 56:36.656
I'll load him also.

57:07.922 --> 57:10.757
<i>The best way to get the one
who really did this to Harry</i>

57:10.759 --> 57:13.196
<i>is to let Randall
live a little longer.</i>

57:15.464 --> 57:18.634
<i>I'm going to enjoy
when that's no longer needed.</i>

57:21.335 --> 57:23.236
<i>Patricia Sherman
continues her campaign</i>

57:23.238 --> 57:25.304
<i>on behalf of her husband,
the current president,</i>

57:25.306 --> 57:27.940
<i>and stopped in to address
the EconBrussles,</i>

57:27.942 --> 57:29.176
<i>covering a wide range
of topics,</i>

57:29.178 --> 57:30.944
<i>from environmental awareness</i>

57:30.946 --> 57:33.750
<i>to the upcoming vote
in less than three weeks.</i>

57:58.040 --> 57:59.473
Wow. Religion.

57:59.475 --> 58:01.208
Frederik, didn't know
you had it in you.

58:01.210 --> 58:04.076
You're so practical.

58:08.015 --> 58:09.815
I miss him.

58:09.817 --> 58:11.417
Harry? Please, Frederik.

58:11.419 --> 58:13.053
We can dispense
with the pleasantries.

58:13.055 --> 58:14.790
You don't like many of us.

58:15.991 --> 58:17.991
Was Harry just a random killing?

58:17.993 --> 58:20.326
I'm looking into it.

58:20.328 --> 58:22.462
If I find out
that your jealousy

58:22.464 --> 58:24.531
of us hiring Harry
to lead this campaign over you

58:24.533 --> 58:26.235
had anything to do with this...

58:35.310 --> 58:37.143
<i>The streets are full of people</i>

58:37.145 --> 58:39.481
<i>who'd sell their secrets
for 40 euro.</i>

58:41.315 --> 58:43.516
<i>Some for 20.</i>

58:43.518 --> 58:46.221
<i>And I'm only too glad
to pay for them.</i>

59:17.218 --> 59:19.020
Detective Blaze.

59:22.491 --> 59:24.193
Yeah.

59:37.239 --> 59:38.971
Take it easy.

59:38.973 --> 59:42.911
I need to ask a favor,
from one old friend to another.

59:45.214 --> 59:48.547
There's a leak
inside the department.

59:48.549 --> 59:53.118
I need you to find out
who's got links to Max Eddelman.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.520
Someone inside is helping him.

59:54.522 --> 59:57.093
Randall and Eddelman
are linked.

59:58.893 --> 01:00:01.228
Who do you think
is the leak?

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:04.196
Bastien is the only one
that knows about the link.

01:00:04.198 --> 01:00:06.399
There's a lot more riding
on this election

01:00:06.401 --> 01:00:09.205
than just whose ass is warming
the president's chair.

01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:23.382
She certainly has the motivation
to dig into this.

01:00:23.384 --> 01:00:25.317
We need someone like that
on our side.

01:00:25.319 --> 01:00:28.455
I'll get the answers from the
police about Harry. Trust me.

01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:30.891
I'm sure they're doing
the best they can.

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:33.296
They can try harder.

01:00:36.464 --> 01:00:39.299
He's right. The only bullet
that could've killed Harry

01:00:39.301 --> 01:00:40.303
had to be silver.

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:44.103
Wish you were here.

01:00:44.105 --> 01:00:46.105
Me too, darling.

01:00:46.107 --> 01:00:48.308
They need to see that this
hasn't hurt our campaign.

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:51.011
Frederik, go prep the team.

01:00:51.013 --> 01:00:53.348
Ready to take on a thousand
questions from these guys?

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.415
I wouldn't expect anything else.

01:00:56.417 --> 01:00:58.053
There's my president.

01:01:23.178 --> 01:01:26.045
I just need it this one time.

01:01:26.047 --> 01:01:30.016
Do you have any idea
what you need?

01:01:30.018 --> 01:01:35.154
I'm dealing with a rough crowd.
They're using silver bullets.

01:01:35.156 --> 01:01:37.056
Sounds terrifying.

01:01:37.058 --> 01:01:38.995
You have no idea.

01:01:43.265 --> 01:01:46.098
Your ancestors died for this.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.335
<i>It's ancient blood
of vampires.</i>

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.969
<i>Keep that in mind.</i>

01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:52.071
<i>Many people would
give anything for this.</i>

01:01:52.073 --> 01:01:54.373
<i>It's not something we give out.</i>

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:56.676
<i>It should make your mind
a fortress,</i>

01:01:56.678 --> 01:02:00.379
<i>but the effects might
take a toll on you physically.</i>

01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:03.485
<i>But your mind will be sharper,
and she won't get in.</i>

01:02:46.227 --> 01:02:48.363
Don't tell me you're leaving us.

01:02:53.535 --> 01:02:55.402
The city's not safe.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:58.304
Frederik, you know we must
support our president

01:02:58.306 --> 01:02:59.638
in these trying times.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.110
Any progress on Harry?

01:03:03.645 --> 01:03:07.714
He was...
carrying the debate strategy.

01:03:07.716 --> 01:03:09.752
The only other person
who knew about that was you.

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.453
Speakerphone, Frederik.

01:03:16.223 --> 01:03:18.193
Who is this?

01:04:04.739 --> 01:04:06.573
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:04:06.575 --> 01:04:09.375
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. President.

01:04:09.377 --> 01:04:13.545
I don't like ultimatums,
but you've left me no choice.

01:04:13.547 --> 01:04:16.149
<i>Gimme that. Yes. This is mine.</i>

01:04:16.151 --> 01:04:17.484
<i>Take that.</i>

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:18.750
<i>The leg.</i>

01:04:18.752 --> 01:04:20.252
Where did you find this?

01:04:20.254 --> 01:04:21.587
What the fuck are you?

01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:23.857
I'm your duly-elected president,

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:27.359
trying to make things
better for everyone.

01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:30.362
Humans too.

01:04:30.364 --> 01:04:32.866
Listen, you freak.

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:35.270
Kill the Free Energy program.

01:04:37.205 --> 01:04:39.739
It took me 30 years to develop.

01:04:39.741 --> 01:04:41.741
This can't happen overnight.

01:04:41.743 --> 01:04:44.143
You have two days to kill it.

01:04:44.145 --> 01:04:45.647
That's absurd.

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:53.386
<i>You're doing well.
Getting some people upset.</i>

01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:55.154
<i>Keep going.</i>

01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:58.324
<i>The potion's good for seven
days at a time.</i>

01:04:58.326 --> 01:05:01.794
<i>Very clever. I can only get you
when you're sleeping.</i>

01:05:01.796 --> 01:05:04.230
Kristy.

01:05:04.232 --> 01:05:06.632
Kristy.

01:05:06.634 --> 01:05:09.435
Do you hear my voice?

01:05:09.437 --> 01:05:13.739
Pay attention to my words.

01:05:13.741 --> 01:05:16.643
Follow my voice.

01:05:16.645 --> 01:05:20.245
Let me in.

01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:22.248
Did you dream of me?

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:25.752
<i>Do you remember
what we talked about?</i>

01:05:25.754 --> 01:05:28.388
<i>You've been wasting time.</i>

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.589
<i>You need to focus again.</i>

01:05:30.591 --> 01:05:33.259
<i>And keep an eye on McGregor.</i>

01:05:33.261 --> 01:05:34.763
<i>He's involved.</i>

01:05:45.707 --> 01:05:47.339
I want them taken out.

01:05:47.341 --> 01:05:50.777
The girl, the cop,
the inspector.

01:05:50.779 --> 01:05:52.277
Mostly the girl.

01:05:52.279 --> 01:05:53.446
Right, but...

01:05:53.448 --> 01:05:57.417
But nothing!
It has to happen!

01:05:57.419 --> 01:05:58.817
You want her taken out?

01:05:58.819 --> 01:06:01.323
Call Randall,
tell him no mistake.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:09.265
Do it.

01:06:12.466 --> 01:06:15.734
We don't care what it costs.
Just take care of this.

01:06:15.736 --> 01:06:17.437
Well, figure it out.

01:06:17.439 --> 01:06:19.672
But you missed with the car.

01:06:19.674 --> 01:06:21.343
Don't miss this time.

01:06:23.277 --> 01:06:24.810
<i>This is Alabastar Blazine</i>

01:06:24.812 --> 01:06:28.647
<i>of the Brussels
Metro Police Department.</i>

01:06:28.649 --> 01:06:31.319
<i>Please leave a message.
Thank you!</i>

01:06:33.254 --> 01:06:35.621
Hey, it's me.
Can you meet?

01:06:35.623 --> 01:06:36.558
It's important.

01:06:58.546 --> 01:07:00.346
The city mourns the death

01:07:00.348 --> 01:07:04.283
of 15-year veteran police
detective, Alabastar Blazine,

01:07:04.285 --> 01:07:06.685
who died this afternoon
in a car explosion

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:09.888
outside an uptown Helge
parking garage.

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:12.324
Foul play is not being
ruled out at this time.

01:07:12.326 --> 01:07:14.359
We will continue to bring you
more information

01:07:14.361 --> 01:07:15.363
as it becomes available.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.594
Who is it?

01:07:48.596 --> 01:07:50.632
McGregor. Open up.

01:07:55.669 --> 01:07:56.971
Warm welcome.

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:01.074
You expecting
someone dangerous?

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:03.576
I don't know
who to trust anymore.

01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:06.011
Bastien just called me.

01:08:06.013 --> 01:08:08.448
Found a bomb
under his car too.

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:09.815
Is he all right?

01:08:09.817 --> 01:08:13.786
Yeah. Bit spooked. Okay.

01:08:13.788 --> 01:08:16.421
Makes two of us.

01:08:16.424 --> 01:08:18.691
Blaze called to tell me
that there was a link

01:08:18.693 --> 01:08:22.462
inside the department
to Randall Jackson.

01:08:22.464 --> 01:08:24.029
My department?

01:08:24.032 --> 01:08:25.365
No.

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:26.698
Who?

01:08:26.701 --> 01:08:28.100
The bomb took him out
before he told me.

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:31.370
So you had to invite me
all the way down here.

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:34.005
Just couldn't tell me
over the phone?

01:08:34.006 --> 01:08:37.509
I didn't call you.
Your secretary sent me a message

01:08:37.511 --> 01:08:39.380
to say that you'd meet me
at my office.

01:08:43.451 --> 01:08:45.520
See, I don't have a secretary.

01:08:46.955 --> 01:08:49.087
Shooter! Go, go!

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:50.326
Go, go!

01:09:02.136 --> 01:09:03.639
Don't worry.
We're gonna make it.

01:09:22.991 --> 01:09:23.992
Freeze!

01:09:25.059 --> 01:09:26.091
Freeze!

01:09:47.782 --> 01:09:49.385
Thank you.

01:09:55.089 --> 01:09:56.725
Bomb!

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:19.177
What the devil are you?

01:10:19.179 --> 01:10:21.517
What the hell do you think I am?

01:10:25.886 --> 01:10:27.121
Let's get a drink.

01:10:36.497 --> 01:10:40.031
So are all these people...

01:10:40.033 --> 01:10:42.904
not... people?

01:10:45.139 --> 01:10:46.672
Not most of them.

01:10:46.674 --> 01:10:50.042
Don't werewolves eat humans?

01:10:50.044 --> 01:10:51.944
Yeah, we do.

01:10:51.946 --> 01:10:54.646
I'm only messing with you.

01:10:54.648 --> 01:10:56.848
A nice juicy steak
will do for me,

01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:59.852
just like vampires don't go
around biting people's necks

01:10:59.854 --> 01:11:01.987
and can go out during the day.

01:11:01.989 --> 01:11:04.723
We can adapt, you know.

01:11:04.725 --> 01:11:08.527
You may say that, but what about
the deaths in the parks?

01:11:08.529 --> 01:11:11.963
I mean, you do know that
werewolves are behind it.

01:11:11.965 --> 01:11:13.865
They're friends of Randall's,

01:11:13.867 --> 01:11:17.203
trying to distract police
and undermine the president.

01:11:17.205 --> 01:11:21.240
Ah! So you are
keeping something from me.

01:11:21.242 --> 01:11:22.909
But all this?

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:25.945
Never in my darkest dreams.

01:11:25.947 --> 01:11:28.280
<i>First Lady Patricia Sherman
took the stage today</i>

01:11:28.282 --> 01:11:31.150
<i>at the International States
Business Summit.</i>

01:11:31.152 --> 01:11:32.985
<i>She made her first
public statements</i>

01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:34.920
<i>since the death
of Harry Goldstone.</i>

01:11:34.922 --> 01:11:38.190
I'm immensely proud
of the European Federation.

01:11:38.192 --> 01:11:41.160
We will use our fears to stay
the United States of Europe

01:11:41.162 --> 01:11:43.329
and become a stronger,
more peaceful order,

01:11:43.331 --> 01:11:45.231
as an example
to the rest of the world,

01:11:45.233 --> 01:11:47.667
something my husband wanted
for so long,

01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:49.802
<i>to unite us all.</i>

01:11:49.804 --> 01:11:51.873
Frank, two doubles, please.

01:11:56.277 --> 01:11:58.177
Cheers.

01:11:58.179 --> 01:12:01.283
So we've got enough
to convict Eddelman.

01:12:02.349 --> 01:12:04.350
Convict him of what?

01:12:04.352 --> 01:12:06.185
If I raise
some suspicious alone,

01:12:06.187 --> 01:12:09.187
he'll sue the department
back into the Stone Age.

01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:10.856
Until you bring me
some hard evidence

01:12:10.858 --> 01:12:12.658
that links him
to Harry's death,

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.226
I can't even touch him.

01:12:14.228 --> 01:12:16.762
Eddelman and Kilborn have
practically stolen the campaign.

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:19.167
That's politics, you know.
It's politics.

01:12:21.234 --> 01:12:23.335
So they knew
Blaze was onto something,

01:12:23.337 --> 01:12:26.137
and they knew
he was gonna tell me,

01:12:26.139 --> 01:12:28.774
which only means...

01:12:28.776 --> 01:12:30.875
they're gonna
come after us again.

01:12:30.877 --> 01:12:32.911
Not unless
we get to them first.

01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:37.149
They could hit us any time,
any place, any day.

01:12:37.151 --> 01:12:39.020
Any day.

01:12:41.723 --> 01:12:43.356
What's the date today?

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:44.660
25th.

01:12:45.993 --> 01:12:48.828
- The calendar!
- What calendar?

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:50.195
The calendar
in Randall's apartment.

01:12:50.197 --> 01:12:51.998
The 25th was circled,
the number 8.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.234
We know he's linked
to Eddelman.

01:12:55.236 --> 01:12:57.335
The president
has a party tonight.

01:12:57.337 --> 01:12:58.870
They're having an office party.

01:12:58.872 --> 01:13:01.173
He is a walking target.

01:13:01.175 --> 01:13:02.374
I'm driving.

01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:04.410
Wait.

01:13:04.412 --> 01:13:06.348
I think I might need this.

01:13:11.118 --> 01:13:14.188
It's actually not bad, Frank.

01:13:38.312 --> 01:13:39.445
Come on! Come on!

01:13:39.447 --> 01:13:41.746
We gotta go faster than this.

01:13:41.748 --> 01:13:43.919
Do you wanna just
shut up? You're not helping.

01:13:53.027 --> 01:13:55.093
<i>Patricia, we're ready
for you in two minutes.</i>

01:13:55.095 --> 01:13:57.732
<i>We'll start with your speech
and then move to the questions.</i>

01:14:10.845 --> 01:14:12.712
So do you have
any silver bullets?

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.312
Never had any use for it.

01:14:14.314 --> 01:14:16.350
Maybe this time
you might need them.

01:14:24.425 --> 01:14:28.194
<i>Tactical detail,
stay out of sight at all times.</i>

01:14:28.196 --> 01:14:31.062
<i>I want weapons teams
on the ground floor</i>

01:14:31.064 --> 01:14:32.299
<i>and in the garage.</i>

01:14:38.206 --> 01:14:39.972
I don't know.
I'm giving up.

01:14:39.974 --> 01:14:41.973
I've giving up because
we're not gonna make it.

01:14:41.975 --> 01:14:44.310
We're gonna make it.
Trust me!

01:14:44.312 --> 01:14:45.747
I'm calling Bastien.

01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:50.316
Are you sure about this,
Lieutenant?

01:14:50.318 --> 01:14:53.185
Listen,
you keep your eyes open.

01:14:53.187 --> 01:14:55.920
Trust me on this, Bastien!
Eyes open!

01:14:55.922 --> 01:14:58.022
I can be there
in a few minutes.

01:14:58.024 --> 01:14:59.960
Expect anything!

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:04.329
Is there anything
you need right now?

01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:06.300
Can we run
and get you anything?

01:15:26.386 --> 01:15:31.125
Echo Team, maintain control
of our escape vector.

01:15:36.397 --> 01:15:39.498
The longer we wait, if we just
don't go right after we hear it,

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.801
then it's gonna
keep happening.

01:16:01.087 --> 01:16:04.024
I want a one-mile
primary perimeter.

01:16:28.282 --> 01:16:30.385
No!

01:16:33.287 --> 01:16:36.024
You take the back,
I've got the front. Go, go!

01:17:11.524 --> 01:17:13.392
Son of a bitch.

01:17:13.394 --> 01:17:15.030
Wish I could've
killed you myself.

01:17:31.245 --> 01:17:34.114
Looks like someone's
covering their tracks.

01:17:37.151 --> 01:17:40.322
Bastien, mind pointing
that somewhere else?

01:17:41.956 --> 01:17:44.222
- Dead. Shot twice.
- By who?

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:46.691
Just saw Max Eddelman
get on a lift.

01:17:46.693 --> 01:17:48.627
Let's go!

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:57.002
Where's Bastien?

01:17:57.004 --> 01:17:58.372
- Sent him around the back way.
- No!

01:19:44.778 --> 01:19:46.712
Do you need an ambulance?

01:19:46.714 --> 01:19:49.149
No, I'm okay.

01:19:50.617 --> 01:19:51.685
Where's Bastien?

01:19:59.059 --> 01:20:00.691
Tributes from world leaders

01:20:00.693 --> 01:20:02.694
continue to pour in
for the late President Sherman.

01:20:02.696 --> 01:20:05.696
Comes as a possible
response to local unrest

01:20:05.698 --> 01:20:07.332
that has been overwhelming
city police...

01:20:07.334 --> 01:20:09.133
A president-elect crisis team

01:20:09.135 --> 01:20:10.802
is now meeting in private to
deal with this tragic situation.

01:20:10.804 --> 01:20:13.304
We have various
reports from Brussels police,

01:20:13.306 --> 01:20:15.406
which we are gonna bring you
later on in this broadcast.

01:20:15.408 --> 01:20:18.310
We are getting ready to tune in
live to an address to the nation

01:20:18.312 --> 01:20:19.677
from the First Lady
Patricia Sherman.

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:22.181
It's difficult to put into words

01:20:22.183 --> 01:20:23.816
how much the tremendous support
from the people of Europe

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:25.651
means to me.

01:20:25.653 --> 01:20:29.120
As president, my husband gave
everything for this federation.

01:20:29.122 --> 01:20:31.222
He even gave his life for it.

01:20:31.224 --> 01:20:33.659
He and I spoke many times
about how being president

01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:36.594
was the highest privilege
he could ever imagine.

01:20:36.596 --> 01:20:39.431
This European Federation
was his home.

01:20:39.433 --> 01:20:41.667
His biggest pride.

01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:43.535
In the spirit of that pride,

01:20:43.537 --> 01:20:46.838
I am announcing that I will be
taking his place on the ballot

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:50.342
for the office of President.

01:20:50.344 --> 01:20:52.477
A vote for Patricia Sherman

01:20:52.479 --> 01:20:56.115
is a vote
honoring my late husband.

01:20:56.117 --> 01:20:57.452
Thank you.

01:21:00.254 --> 01:21:01.520
<i>Oui, allo?</i>

01:21:01.522 --> 01:21:04.289
I need to book flight
for tomorrow

01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:05.691
or even tonight late.

01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:08.160
<i>Okay, for tomorrow?</i>

01:21:08.162 --> 01:21:09.828
First flight you have
to Jamaica.

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.533
<i>Yes, this can be done.</i>

01:21:35.555 --> 01:21:37.388
<i>Somebody's tying up
loose ends.</i>

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:38.891
<i>And in a hurry.</i>

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:40.625
<i>But who?</i>

01:21:40.627 --> 01:21:43.361
<i>Only a few players left.</i>

01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:46.531
<i>Haven't I killed most of them?</i>

01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:49.267
<i>Come on, come on, think!</i>

01:21:49.269 --> 01:21:52.107
<i>There's a big piece
not on the table.</i>

01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:56.575
McGregor, where are you?
You need to check on Matthew.

01:21:56.577 --> 01:21:58.677
I know he has
something to do with this.

01:21:58.679 --> 01:22:00.945
<i>Who's on the inside?</i>

01:22:00.947 --> 01:22:02.948
<i>Someone out there knows.</i>

01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:05.553
<i>I can feel it.</i>

01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:13.161
<i>I just hope I'm not too late.</i>

01:22:30.477 --> 01:22:32.543
<i>Patricia Sherman
is the new president</i>

01:22:32.545 --> 01:22:34.213
- <i>of the European Federation...</i>
- Nina.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:36.481
<i>with a resounding
58% to 41% victory</i>

01:22:36.483 --> 01:22:39.584
- It's about time.
- <i>over Ambassador John Kilborn.</i>

01:22:39.586 --> 01:22:41.219
<i>We have polls now reporting</i>

01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:44.755
<i>in 87% of Federation
voting locations,</i>

01:22:44.757 --> 01:22:47.926
<i>in all EF nations
other than Bulgaria.</i>

01:22:47.928 --> 01:22:50.896
<i>We will take you live now
to the campaign headquarters,</i>

01:22:50.898 --> 01:22:52.664
<i>where Madame Sherman
is expected to give</i>

01:22:52.666 --> 01:22:55.234
<i>a victory speech this hour.</i>

01:23:44.484 --> 01:23:45.920
What the fuck?

01:24:05.406 --> 01:24:06.771
Are you heading somewhere?

01:24:06.773 --> 01:24:08.740
<i>Bien s√ªr.</i>

01:24:08.742 --> 01:24:11.743
Hmm. Well, I hope you stick
around for next week's agenda.

01:24:11.745 --> 01:24:13.411
Okay.

01:24:13.413 --> 01:24:15.012
Do you remember
what we talked about?

01:24:15.014 --> 01:24:17.449
I said yes. <i>C'est la.</i>

01:24:17.451 --> 01:24:19.654
I'm sure you won't
want to miss it.

01:24:21.688 --> 01:24:24.258
<i>Bonsoir, Frederik.
Au bon sant.</i>

01:24:59.026 --> 01:25:01.296
Thank you for seeing me,
Mrs. President.

01:25:02.962 --> 01:25:06.063
Excuse me. <i>Miss</i> President.

01:25:06.065 --> 01:25:09.034
- Did you come to apologize?
- For what?

01:25:09.036 --> 01:25:11.136
For not preventing
my husband's death.

01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:12.870
We could've prevented it
if you...

01:25:12.872 --> 01:25:15.606
And I'm sure
you're broken up about it.

01:25:15.608 --> 01:25:18.642
Our business has concluded.

01:25:18.644 --> 01:25:20.645
Haven't you done enough?

01:25:20.647 --> 01:25:23.981
You had me completely fooled.

01:25:23.983 --> 01:25:26.051
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:25:26.053 --> 01:25:28.018
Stolen debate material,

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.454
death threats backed up
by Harry's murder.

01:25:30.456 --> 01:25:32.156
You had us all
looking the wrong direction

01:25:32.158 --> 01:25:33.792
'cause when a husband
gets murdered,

01:25:33.794 --> 01:25:36.927
who's the first person
that police look to?

01:25:36.929 --> 01:25:39.130
Unless the evidence
points otherwise.

01:25:39.132 --> 01:25:40.664
Maybe a political motive.

01:25:40.666 --> 01:25:42.734
I don't appreciate
your accusations.

01:25:42.736 --> 01:25:44.936
You couldn't have done it
all by yourself.

01:25:44.938 --> 01:25:47.672
You needed heavy lifting.

01:25:47.674 --> 01:25:49.775
Keep the investigation
pointed away from you.

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:52.878
So this is what I'm paying for?
Accusations?

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.513
The same person

01:25:55.515 --> 01:25:59.450
who's pointing a gun to
the back of my head right now.

01:25:59.452 --> 01:26:02.521
Eddelman was killed
by a silver bullet.

01:26:02.523 --> 01:26:05.557
Only someone who knew he was
a wolf would've used one.

01:26:05.559 --> 01:26:07.459
Well done.

01:26:07.461 --> 01:26:09.731
Maybe there is room for you
in the new administration.

01:26:11.063 --> 01:26:12.963
Here's what's going to happen.

01:26:12.965 --> 01:26:16.767
McGregor will suffer
a fatal accident very soon,

01:26:16.769 --> 01:26:18.805
which leaves me with
one loose end to tie up.

01:26:25.711 --> 01:26:27.013
About damn time.

01:26:55.175 --> 01:26:56.908
<i>You've done well.</i>

01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:59.744
<i>Everything I've asked
as best you can.</i>

01:26:59.746 --> 01:27:02.713
<i>And for that,
you have my gratitude,</i>

01:27:02.715 --> 01:27:04.651
<i>which is not easy to come by.</i>

01:27:22.769 --> 01:27:26.271
<i>I removed all traces
of my endeavors.</i>

01:27:26.273 --> 01:27:30.141
<i>McGregor,
he won't let you...</i>

01:27:30.143 --> 01:27:31.877
<i>He's one of us now.</i>

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.878
<i>You don't need
to worry about him.</i>

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.946
<i>There's no one else
to think about.</i>

01:27:35.948 --> 01:27:38.816
<i>Get out of my head.
Just stop.</i>

01:27:38.818 --> 01:27:41.852
<i>Someone needs
to take the fall.</i>

01:27:41.854 --> 01:27:45.257
<i>We need a face on the tragedy
of the last month.</i>

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:48.994
<i>You will be that face.</i>

01:27:48.996 --> 01:27:51.730
<i>Tomorrow, you will
turn yourself in.</i>

01:27:51.732 --> 01:27:53.531
<i>Bastien will be with you.</i>

01:27:53.533 --> 01:27:55.734
<i>You'll confess to killing
Randall and Mason</i>

01:27:55.736 --> 01:27:57.735
<i>in retaliation
for Harry's murder.</i>

01:27:57.737 --> 01:28:00.004
<i>You'll be given
a lenient sentence.</i>

01:28:00.006 --> 01:28:01.539
<i>Two to four years.</i>

01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:03.941
<i>You'll only serve
twelve months.</i>

01:28:03.943 --> 01:28:08.146
<i>Then you'll be compensated like
you never thought possible.</i>

01:28:08.148 --> 01:28:10.084
<i>You'll never be poor again.</i>

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:16.120
<i>So take your reward...</i>

01:28:16.122 --> 01:28:18.890
<i>if you have the courage
to take it.</i>

01:28:18.892 --> 01:28:22.660
<i>This is the last thing
I'll ask of you, Wolfe.</i>

01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:25.730
<i>Meet your destiny.</i>

01:28:25.732 --> 01:28:27.868
<i>Harry would be proud of you.</i>

01:28:31.203 --> 01:28:35.809
<i>You just put down your fears,
and lift yourself with me.</i>

01:28:57.063 --> 01:28:58.696
<i>I didn't find...</i>

01:28:58.698 --> 01:29:00.701
<i>Who do you think
killed him?</i>

01:29:04.203 --> 01:29:06.137
<i>No.</i>

01:29:06.139 --> 01:29:08.306
<i>I'll do what I have to.</i>

01:29:08.308 --> 01:29:11.910
<i>Take the sentence if I need to,</i>

01:29:11.912 --> 01:29:14.916
<i>then... take her up
on her offer.</i>

01:29:19.152 --> 01:29:22.820
<i>It'll be all right, won't it?</i>

01:29:22.822 --> 01:29:25.825
<i>What choice do I have?</i>

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.298
<i>Harry... died for nothing.</i>

01:29:32.866 --> 01:29:35.633
<i>But I won't forget this.</i>

01:29:35.635 --> 01:29:37.802
<i>I'll remember everything.</i>

01:29:37.804 --> 01:29:40.638
<i>The people, the cause.</i>

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.642
<i>The shine on the street.
Everything.</i>

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:45.009
<i>Everything.</i>

01:29:45.011 --> 01:29:47.811
<i>They won't keep me in a cage.</i>

01:29:47.813 --> 01:29:52.182
<i>I'll be out,
and I'll be on her every day.</i>

01:29:52.184 --> 01:29:55.085
<i>I've already
won the election.</i>

01:29:55.087 --> 01:29:57.288
<i>Have to be positive.</i>

01:29:57.290 --> 01:30:00.661
<i>Stay busy.
Concentrate again.</i>

01:30:04.096 --> 01:30:06.867
<i>Remain focused on Harry.</i>

01:30:11.037 --> 01:30:14.105
<i>No more racking my brain.</i>

01:30:14.107 --> 01:30:16.941
<i>No more wondering.</i>

01:30:16.943 --> 01:30:19.811
<i>Tomorrow you will
turn yourself in.</i>

01:30:19.813 --> 01:30:21.913
<i>It happens whether or not
you come along, Wolfe.</i>

01:30:21.915 --> 01:30:24.783
<i>I've already won the election.</i>

01:30:24.785 --> 01:30:26.787
<i>Everything is resolved now.</i>

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.186
<i>Did you know?</i>

01:30:29.188 --> 01:30:30.789
<i>Did I know what?</i>

01:30:30.791 --> 01:30:32.390
<i>She could still
read my mind.</i>

01:30:32.392 --> 01:30:34.726
<i>She heard every thought.</i>

01:30:34.728 --> 01:30:36.794
<i>There was no way
to prevent that.</i>

01:30:36.796 --> 01:30:38.696
<i>She's truly amazing.</i>

01:30:38.698 --> 01:30:41.736
<i>I guess that's why
she is where she is.</i>

01:31:32.352 --> 01:31:34.953
<i>I'll be out
in a year or so.</i>

01:31:34.955 --> 01:31:36.754
<i>Not that long.</i>

01:31:36.756 --> 01:31:40.260
<i>Plenty of time
to think it over and plan.</i>

01:31:43.964 --> 01:31:46.964
<i>She's won for now.</i>

01:31:46.966 --> 01:31:48.199
<i>Today.</i>

01:31:48.201 --> 01:31:50.267
<i>I'll have my day.</i>

01:31:50.269 --> 01:31:54.075
<i>It just won't be
for a year or so.</i>

01:31:56.175 --> 01:31:57.875
<i>She'll let me out
on the pretense</i>

01:31:57.877 --> 01:32:00.779
<i>that I'll be
an asset for her.</i>

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:04.883
<i>I'll be the animal
Harry told me I was.</i>

01:32:04.885 --> 01:32:06.721
<i>I have to do this.</i>

01:32:07.987 --> 01:32:09.521
<i>But it's not over.</i>

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:12.524
<i>And when it's done,
and I'm done,</i>

01:32:12.526 --> 01:32:14.092
<i>Harry will have his day.</i>

01:32:14.094 --> 01:32:15.860
<i>I won't forget him.</i>

01:32:15.862 --> 01:32:18.295
<i>She won't keep me in a cage
for very long.</i>

01:32:18.297 --> 01:32:22.469
<i>When I get out,
she will burn.</i>

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:50.993
