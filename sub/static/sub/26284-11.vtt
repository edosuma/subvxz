00:02.044 --> 00:04.213
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:04.296 --> 00:06.090
Why was Veronica
Duncan hugging you?

00:06.173 --> 00:08.134
I'm tutoring her
in trigonometry.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.344
Just between us,
she's a little slow.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.847
That's not what I heard.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.099
There's nobody
at my house.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.809
- You want to come over?
- Yes.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.644
- What's that?
- Some stupid haunted house

00:18.728 --> 00:20.771
my mother's doing
for the church.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.857
<i>Mr. Lundy's scene about lust</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:24.900
<i>made a deep impact
on my brother's date.</i>

00:24.984 --> 00:27.528
<i>She asked to be saved by Jesus.</i>

00:27.611 --> 00:29.947
I don't want to live
like this anymore.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.949
<i>And as it turns out, she was.</i>

00:32.033 --> 00:34.660
Dear Lord Jesus,
set me free.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.291
<i>In</i> Conquest
of the Planet of the Apes,

00:40.374 --> 00:43.878
<i>we learned how humans taught
the apes to become civilized,</i>

00:43.961 --> 00:45.605
<i>which I think should start
with potty training,</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:47.631
<i>but I'm not a screenwriter.</i>

00:47.715 --> 00:49.216
Can you help me
with my math homework?

00:49.300 --> 00:50.384
No.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.053
Please. It's really hard.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.971
"It" isn't the problem.

00:54.055 --> 00:55.389
Sheldon.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.600
Fine, what are you working on?

00:57.683 --> 00:59.685
There's a number,
then there's a line,

00:59.769 --> 01:01.479
then there's another number
under it.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.147
Fractions?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.107
Yes, fractions.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.110
<i>At that moment,</i>

01:08.194 --> 01:10.821
<i>it occurred to me if I could
teach mathematics</i>

01:10.905 --> 01:13.115
<i>to someone as dull-witted
as my sister,</i>

01:13.199 --> 01:14.742
<i>I could create
a race of superhumans</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:16.869
<i>that would do my bidding.</i>

01:16.952 --> 01:19.371
<i>And who wouldn't want that?</i>

01:19.455 --> 01:21.040
Please, Sheldon.

01:21.123 --> 01:24.251
You know what, Missy?
I'd be happy to help you.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.003
Thank you.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.508

01:30.591 --> 01:33.344

01:38.349 --> 01:42.478
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪</i>

01:44.897 --> 01:48.109
Try thinking of it this way:
imagine a pie.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.860
The number on the bottom
of the fraction

01:49.944 --> 01:52.488
is how many pieces the pie
has been sliced into.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.906
What kind of pie is it?

01:53.989 --> 01:55.241
Doesn't matter.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.575
But it would help me picture it

01:56.659 --> 01:57.910
if I knew the kind of pie.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.829
Fine, it's banana cream.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.747
I don't like banana cream.

02:01.831 --> 02:04.542
Okay, what kind of pie
would you like it to be?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.419
What about those little
apple pies from McDonalds?

02:07.503 --> 02:10.005
- Sure.
- I burned my mouth on one of those.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.633
Didn't stop me. I still ate it.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.180
Veronica. Hi.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.765
Hey, Georgie.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.560
You... you changed your hair.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.520
I did.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.772
It's shorter.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.233
It is.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.527
I like it.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.988
Thank... thanks.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.281
You here to see me?

02:35.364 --> 02:37.199
I... I'm here for your mom's
Bible study.

02:38.409 --> 02:41.036
Oh, sure, of course.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.538
I'm glad you could join us.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.374
Come in, won't you?

02:45.457 --> 02:48.043
You're part of the group, too?

02:48.127 --> 02:52.089
Faith, the Bible, God,
I'm nuts for that stuff.

02:56.886 --> 03:00.931
So one fourth
of the 12 pieces of pie is...?

03:01.015 --> 03:02.600
Three?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.684
Yes.

03:03.767 --> 03:07.313
And one third
of the 12 pieces is...?

03:07.396 --> 03:08.606
Four?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.358
Yes. Now how much is one-third
of the pie plus

03:11.442 --> 03:12.943
one-fourth of the pie?

03:13.027 --> 03:18.616
Well, three plus four is seven,
but there's 12 pieces,

03:18.699 --> 03:21.118
so seven-twelve-iths.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.330
It's twelfths. And yes.

03:25.331 --> 03:26.916
I did it.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.584
<i>Actually,</i> I <i>did it.</i>

03:28.667 --> 03:32.296
<i>In less than ten minutes,
I taught fractions to a monkey.</i>

03:33.923 --> 03:37.259
Welcome, Veronica.
We're so glad to have you.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.554
What are you doing?

03:40.638 --> 03:42.681
What's it look like?
I'm here for Bible study.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.767
Did you just take a shower?

03:44.850 --> 03:45.935
No.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.728
You did, too.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.189
So I want to be clean for Jesus.
Get off my back.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.817
Interesting.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.153
Georgie, if you want
to be a good Christian,

03:56.237 --> 03:58.197
maybe you should stop
lying through your teeth.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.199
Just be happy
I brushed them, okay?

04:01.242 --> 04:02.660
- Hmm...
<i>- Okay.</i>

04:02.743 --> 04:03.827
All done. Thanks.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.287
While we're here,
would you like me

04:05.371 --> 04:06.872
to introduce you to algebra?

04:06.956 --> 04:08.290
Al who?

04:08.374 --> 04:09.708
Oh, boy.

04:09.792 --> 04:12.378
It's not a person,
it's an ancient Arabic method

04:12.461 --> 04:14.588
of finding the value
of variables.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.589
Oh. Nah.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.511
<i>Clearly, I needed
a more sophisticated technique</i>

04:20.594 --> 04:22.888
<i>to motivate my simian sister.</i>

04:22.972 --> 04:24.265
Are you sure?

04:24.348 --> 04:28.644
If you learn a little algebra,
I'll give you a banana.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.398
All right, now we're reading
from Matthew 4.

04:32.481 --> 04:35.901
Georgie, why don't you get
us started on verse 17?

04:36.527 --> 04:38.821
- Me?
- Yes, you.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.490
Oh. Okay.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.285
Um... Verse 17...

04:44.368 --> 04:46.453
Verse 17...

04:47.162 --> 04:49.039
Give me a minute.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.250
Here.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.460
Bless you.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.673
Okay, here we go.
"From that time,

04:57.756 --> 05:00.092
Jesus began to preach
and say 'Repent,

05:01.051 --> 05:04.263
change your inner self,
your old way of thinking,

05:04.346 --> 05:06.181
regret past sins,

05:06.265 --> 05:09.518
live your life in a way
that proves repentance:

05:09.601 --> 05:12.354
Seek God's purpose
for your life."

05:12.438 --> 05:13.647
Powerful stuff.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.401
Can I get an amen?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.653
Amen.

05:19.737 --> 05:20.779
Amen.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.785
Need any help there, Sheldon?
I'm looking

05:26.869 --> 05:28.912
for some books
on education theory.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.581
- What for?
- I'm trying

05:30.664 --> 05:32.249
to develop a technique
to teach someone

05:32.333 --> 05:35.210
who falls into the conventional
category of "stupid."

05:35.294 --> 05:38.255
Oh. Well, now, there's a wide
range of stupid.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.174
Can you narrow it down?

05:40.257 --> 05:42.343
She wrote a fan letter to Alf.

05:42.426 --> 05:46.805
Got it. So you're looking
to make a pretty radical change.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.683
Well, ideally, I'd like to wipe
my sister's brain clean

05:49.767 --> 05:51.935
and start over,
but my mom wouldn't like that.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.146
Yeah. Moms are no fun.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.290
Hey, Veronica.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.167
- Georgie.
- So, listen,

06:15.250 --> 06:16.811
I was doing my prayers
last night and, uh,

06:16.835 --> 06:19.671
you won't believe it,
but I think God spoke to me.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.591
Really? What did he say?

06:22.674 --> 06:24.009
Well, I couldn't
understand

06:24.093 --> 06:26.428
all of it, 'cause it was
in an ancient language,

06:26.512 --> 06:27.930
but the part I did understand

06:28.013 --> 06:30.766
is he wants us to spend
more time together.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.018
Doing what?

06:33.102 --> 06:35.479
Oh, you know, praying,
helping the needy.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.606
Your usual Christian activities.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.150
Well, I'm okay with that.

06:40.818 --> 06:44.655
Good. So you, me and God,
we'll hang out.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.407
Sounds good.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.326
Okay. See you later.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.286
See you.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.707
I may be going to hell.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.002
So you're hoping
to create an army

06:59.086 --> 07:01.797
of super-intelligent children
who will do your bidding?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.632
In a perfect world, yes.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.676
You should spend more time
with my mother.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.885
That's her goal, too.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.846
Ooh, this is interesting.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.057
According to Socrates,
all knowledge exists

07:12.141 --> 07:14.309
within the student
and just needs to be drawn out

07:14.393 --> 07:16.186
through skillful questioning.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.690
Are you saying I knew that
before you even said it?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.692
- I don't know, did you?
- Well, according

07:21.775 --> 07:25.279
to Socrates, you do know
and the answer's inside you.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.282
Well, then, ask me a skillful
question to draw it out.

07:29.158 --> 07:32.661
Do you know
if I knew before I knew?

07:34.246 --> 07:35.330
No.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.833
Hey, it works.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.043
It does.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.683
I'm recording my findings

07:54.766 --> 07:57.686
so that future generations
of mankind can understand

07:57.769 --> 08:01.523
the steps I took to create
<i>homo novus,</i> "new man."

08:02.608 --> 08:05.068
Of course, there's a strong
likelihood that my <i>homo novi</i>

08:05.152 --> 08:07.112
might've wiped out
all future generations,

08:07.196 --> 08:09.406
so I have no idea
who's watching this.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.492
What are you doing in here?

08:11.575 --> 08:14.786
I'm keeping a video diary of my
experiment to create <i>homo novus.</i>

08:14.870 --> 08:16.121
<i>Homo</i> what?

08:16.205 --> 08:18.916
<i>Novus.</i> It's Latin.
It means "new man."

08:19.458 --> 08:22.419
Oh. I guess that's okay.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.822
Y... Your mom's at church.
W... What do you want for dinner?

08:27.841 --> 08:30.761
I believe you know
what I want for dinner.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.429
Is that right?

08:32.513 --> 08:33.931
It's Thursday.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.850
What does Mom always make me
on Thursdays?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.559
Spaghetti and hot dogs?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.940
Socrates. Got to love him.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.692

09:16.807 --> 09:19.434
And now, why don't
we take a moment to pray,

09:19.518 --> 09:21.395
keeping in mind
that our prayers

09:21.478 --> 09:23.730
should not be
for our own benefit,

09:23.814 --> 09:26.191
but for our family, friends,

09:26.275 --> 09:31.071
fellow Texans, Americans
of all races and religions

09:31.154 --> 09:32.781
and the world.

09:32.864 --> 09:33.907
Well, most of the world.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.659
Y'all know what countries
to pick.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.164
<i>Lord,
please look after my family.</i>

09:41.248 --> 09:44.293
<i>Give them everything they need
to be happy and healthy.</i>

09:44.376 --> 09:46.503
<i>And this lovely young girl
with me tonight,</i>

09:46.587 --> 09:49.298
<i>help her stay on the path
of righteousness.</i>

09:49.381 --> 09:51.675
<i>God,
please look after my sister.</i>

09:51.758 --> 09:53.736
<i>You can find her at the women's
correctional facility</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:54.928
<i>in Lubbock.</i>

09:55.012 --> 09:56.722
<i>Help her seek salvation in you</i>

09:56.805 --> 10:00.309
<i>instead of cocaine, marijuana
and bass players.</i>

10:00.392 --> 10:02.436
<i>Jesus, I'm sure,
even from Heaven, you can see</i>

10:02.519 --> 10:04.646
<i>how hot the girl
sitting next to me is.</i>

10:04.730 --> 10:06.732
<i>And I know I'm not supposed
to pray for myself,</i>

10:06.815 --> 10:08.609
<i>but here's the deal:
If you can get her</i>

10:08.692 --> 10:10.360
<i>to fall in love with me,
and, you know,</i>

10:10.444 --> 10:12.112
<i>make some bad decisions,</i>

10:12.195 --> 10:14.656
<i>I swear I'll come to church
every Sunday.</i>

10:14.740 --> 10:17.326
<i>And thank you
for bringing Georgie tonight,</i>

10:17.409 --> 10:20.329
<i>even though you and I
both know why he came.</i>

10:20.412 --> 10:22.789
<i>Speaking of which, whatever
he's praying for right now,</i>

10:22.873 --> 10:24.166
<i>ignore it.</i>

10:24.249 --> 10:26.710
<i>And please protect me
from impure thoughts,</i>

10:26.793 --> 10:30.339
<i>and teach me to respect
the sanctity of my body.</i>

10:30.422 --> 10:33.133
<i>Now if, for instance,
she and I were to go skinny dipping</i>

10:33.216 --> 10:34.843
<i>and one thing
were to lead to another</i>

10:34.926 --> 10:37.304
<i>under the moonlit sky,
get this:</i>

10:37.387 --> 10:39.556
<i>Not only do I become
a devout Christian,</i>

10:39.640 --> 10:42.351
<i>I will also bug everybody
I meet to do the same.</i>

10:42.434 --> 10:43.852
<i>And you know
I can be real annoying</i>

10:43.935 --> 10:45.312
<i>when I set my mind to it.</i>

10:45.395 --> 10:46.938
<i>Amen.</i>

10:47.022 --> 10:49.149
<i>Amen.</i>

10:49.232 --> 10:52.402
<i>I'm gonna take
your silence as a yes. Amen.</i>

11:00.160 --> 11:01.411
What are you working on?

11:01.495 --> 11:04.790
A list of possible boyfriends
for my Cabbage Patch doll.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.168
How do you think Celeste would
look next to Joey Lawrence?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.295
I don't know who that is.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.130
He's Blossom's brother.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.299
I don't know who that is.

11:14.383 --> 11:17.260
It's a show. She wears hats.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.347
Anyway, I've been
doing some research,

11:20.430 --> 11:22.241
and I've come to the conclusion
that I don't need

11:22.265 --> 11:23.266
to teach you anything.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.893
You already know everything.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.186
Cool.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.705
Your brain already
contains all the math

11:27.729 --> 11:29.272
that will ever be known.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.483
I heard you and I said, "Cool."

11:31.566 --> 11:33.276
Well, wouldn't you
like to explore

11:33.360 --> 11:35.612
that great treasure
trove of knowledge?

11:35.696 --> 11:38.782
That depends. What's a trove?

11:38.865 --> 11:41.743
We'll circle back to that.
True or false?

11:41.827 --> 11:44.663
At times, you have referred
to yourself as being dumb.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.289
True.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.542
And do you enjoy
feeling that way?

11:49.626 --> 11:50.627
No.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.337
Well, let me change that.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.339
I'm presenting you
with an opportunity

11:54.423 --> 11:56.967
to achieve the full potential
of your mind.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.888
Are you gonna do some experiment
where we switch brains?

12:01.972 --> 12:03.348
No.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.784
'Cause I've seen it
on <i>Gilligan's Island</i>

12:04.808 --> 12:06.226
and I've seen it
on <i>The Flintstones</i>

12:06.309 --> 12:08.270
and it never goes well.

12:11.022 --> 12:14.192
Ooh. Gilligan.

12:14.276 --> 12:18.947
<i>♪ Then sings my soul,
my savior God... ♪</i>

12:19.030 --> 12:21.032
Oh, who do you think
you're fooling here?

12:21.116 --> 12:23.827
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.997
Listen to me. Veronica
has a rough family situation,

12:27.080 --> 12:29.124
and she's trying
to improve her life.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.711
And I admire that.
Very inspirational.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.881
Georgie, believe me,
I'm glad to see you in a church,

12:35.964 --> 12:39.301
but I do not want you
taking advantage of that girl.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.555
Taking advantage? Veronica and I
are Bible buddies, nothing more.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.808
- I'm serious.
- Right.

12:46.892 --> 12:49.352
Maybe you should ask yourself
what's in you

12:49.436 --> 12:51.730
that makes you see sin
in the hearts of others.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.982
Okay, now you're pushing it.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.070
Lord Jesus, please help
my mother with her anger.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.658
- Can I get an amen?
- No.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.038
Why do we need the camera?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.749
So people in the future
can see your transformation.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.460
Where are you going?

13:13.543 --> 13:15.796
To put on a dress
for the future people.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.881
Hello, people of the future.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.760
My name is Missy Cooper
and this is my best friend Celeste.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.304
She's dating Joey Lawrence.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.564
You want to hang out Saturday?

13:34.648 --> 13:37.526
Can't. I signed up
to get baptized.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.487
Oh, yeah. I've been
meaning to do that.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.406
Well, why don't you join me?
We could do it together.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.618
Sure. You and me,
getting double dunked. I like it.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.745
Can you imagine afterwards?

13:48.829 --> 13:51.122
All of our sins
will be washed away.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.834
Yeah, and we can start
cranking out fresh ones.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.713
I just don't know
where I went wrong.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.632
Are you sure your questioning
was skillful?

14:00.715 --> 14:03.802
I thought so, but after
two hours of interrogation,

14:03.885 --> 14:05.595
all I could extract
from my sister's brain

14:05.679 --> 14:08.932
was that there was some sort
of block with new kids on it.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.976
Sheldon, how's your
educational project going?

14:11.059 --> 14:12.936
Poorly. I've hit a wall.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.189
Have you considered B.F.
Skinner's behavior modification?

14:16.273 --> 14:17.732
- What's that?
- It uses punishment

14:17.816 --> 14:20.026
and reward to get
the results you want.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.904
Ooh, punishment.
I like the sound of that.

14:23.738 --> 14:27.367
In the right context, so do I.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.327
I took a real beating
at the craps table,

14:29.411 --> 14:32.372
and then I won it all back
playing Caribbean Stud Poker.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.791
Well, how does
Caribbean Stud Poker work?

14:34.875 --> 14:37.210
I have no idea.
I was drunk off my ass.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.087
Way to go, Mom.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.006
Way to lead a Christian life.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.174
Oh, does my daughter
think poorly of me?

14:43.258 --> 14:44.634
- Yes.
- Good.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.304
I can die happy.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.516
Hey, Mom, just a heads-up.
I'm getting baptized tomorrow.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.561
Good Lord.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.647
That boy's randiness
knows no bounds.

14:57.731 --> 14:58.940
What are you talking about?

14:59.024 --> 15:01.610
He's only doing it
'cause of that Veronica girl.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.820
Oh, sure. That makes sense.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.530
What do you mean,
it makes sense?

15:05.614 --> 15:08.074
When I was his age,
I hitchhiked to Florida

15:08.158 --> 15:10.160
'cause I had a friend
that had a girlfriend

15:10.243 --> 15:12.203
who knew a girl
who might be willing.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.764
But then you met my daughter
and you didn't have

15:13.788 --> 15:15.707
to travel so far.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.172
According to B.F. Skinner,

15:22.255 --> 15:24.966
if I can find the appropriate
punishment to motivate Missy,

15:25.050 --> 15:28.762
there's no limit to what
she might be able to learn.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.556
But what might
that punishment be?

15:31.640 --> 15:33.808
Whip her with a rubber hose?

15:34.434 --> 15:38.063
No. That sounds like a recipe
for tendonitis.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.192
Administer small
electric shocks?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.360
Tricky.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.755
If I get the voltage wrong,
I could spend the rest of my life

15:45.779 --> 15:48.490
in an institution
for the criminally insane.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.286
Or I inflict harm

15:53.370 --> 15:56.706
on the object she loves
more than life itself.

15:59.501 --> 16:04.255
Celeste, you're about to become
part of scientific history.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.677
All right, everybody,
welcome to the 1990

16:08.760 --> 16:10.720
East Texas Baptist Olympics.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.350
'Cause we're in the pool
of water.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.435
Anyway, I want to welcome

16:17.519 --> 16:19.854
our little sister
Veronica Duncan,

16:19.938 --> 16:21.523
who I will be dunkin'.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.483
Sorry.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.152
I can't turn it off.
And I also want to welcome

16:26.236 --> 16:28.321
George Cooper,
who has recently found

16:28.405 --> 16:29.990
his way to the Lord.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.367
Howdy. Praise Jesus.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.162
Are you ready to learn
some advanced calculus?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.539
Nope.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.499
Be right back.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.918
Take your time.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.212
Veronica, do you trust
in Jesus Christ

16:44.295 --> 16:46.840
as your personal
Lord and savior?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.259
I do.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.469
It's upon your
profession of faith

16:51.553 --> 16:54.014
that I baptize you, my sister,

16:54.097 --> 16:59.436
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.356
<i>♪ Wade in the water ♪</i>

17:03.440 --> 17:04.816
<i>♪ Wade ♪</i>

17:04.898 --> 17:09.612
<i>♪ In the water, children, wade ♪</i>

17:09.695 --> 17:12.615

17:24.627 --> 17:26.003
Dang.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.382
All right,
let's try this again.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.985
Would you be ready to learn
some advanced calculus

17:31.009 --> 17:33.136
if it saved Celeste's pigtails?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.972
What are you doing?
Put her down.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.641
Not until I modify
your behavior.

17:38.725 --> 17:43.188
In the name of the Father, Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.231
<i>♪ Drop me in the water... ♪</i>

17:45.315 --> 17:47.317
Sheldon, I'm warning you.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.410
Hallelujah!

17:57.494 --> 17:58.494
We did it!

17:58.536 --> 18:00.121
<i>♪ Tease me... ♪</i>

18:00.205 --> 18:02.207
Ooh, I'm so happy.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.917
I love you.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.712
Is it working?
Are you feeling motivated?

18:07.796 --> 18:09.255
Very.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.223
Care to explain yourself?

18:18.306 --> 18:20.141
I was trying
to motivate Missy

18:20.225 --> 18:22.560
to expand her
intellectual horizons.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.854
By torturing
her Cabbage Patch doll?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.898
Well, it's not like I shocked
her with electrodes,

18:26.981 --> 18:28.858
- which was an option.
- Enough.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.361
To be clear, I meant
to shock Missy, not the doll.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.113
- That would be ineffective.
- Enough!

18:33.196 --> 18:34.447
And you.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.408
Getting baptized just to kiss a girl?
What were you thinking?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.953
Sounds like you know
what I was thinking.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.207
Well, you are both grounded.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.801
<i>Dear Alf,
I'm your number one fan.</i>

18:54.884 --> 18:57.137
<i>I like you because you're
an alien but you're funny,</i>

18:57.220 --> 19:00.557
<i>unlike my brother,
who's an alien but just a jerk.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:03.476
<i>Anyway, I hope you're enjoying
your time here on our planet</i>

19:03.560 --> 19:06.104
<i>and have found things to eat
other than cats.</i>

19:06.187 --> 19:08.314
<i>I recommend chicken nuggets.</i>

19:08.398 --> 19:11.025
<i>Sincerely, Missy Cooper,
age ten.</i>

19:11.109 --> 19:15.363
P.S. My favorite color
is pink. What's yours?

19:15.446 --> 19:17.699
Ha. What a cutie pie.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.493
Hey, hey, Barbara, we got
any more of those pink T-shirts

19:20.577 --> 19:21.703
with my face on them?

19:21.786 --> 19:24.455
I want to send one
to this Missy Cooper kid.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.125
Oh, oh, and get me
some chicken nuggets, huh?

19:27.709 --> 19:30.545
Hello? Anybody out there?

19:32.547 --> 19:34.090
Apparently not.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.885
Barb!
