04:45.270 --> 04:48.405
When you're underwater
for months at a time,

04:48.407 --> 04:50.674
<i>you lose all sense
of day and night.</i>

04:51.977 --> 04:55.113
<i>And there's only awake
and dreaming.</i>

04:56.882 --> 04:58.917
<i>Not that those things
are easy to tell apart.</i>

05:04.423 --> 05:05.889
<i>I think,</i>

05:05.891 --> 05:07.857
<i>or I dream about
the first thing</i>

05:07.859 --> 05:09.127
<i>he ever said to me.</i>

05:15.434 --> 05:17.035
<i>Told me he didn't
believe in time...</i>

05:18.537 --> 05:19.703
<i>only moments.</i>

05:21.206 --> 05:22.939
Hmm.

05:22.941 --> 05:24.342
<i>He was a
glass-half-full type.</i>

05:25.377 --> 05:26.577
All right.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.215
<i>I prefer it empty.</i>

05:36.955 --> 05:38.689
What are you doing here?

05:43.161 --> 05:45.663
<i>I mean, there's a
comfort to cynicism.</i>

05:48.699 --> 05:50.068
<i>There's a lot
less to lose.</i>

07:08.413 --> 07:09.445
Wake up!

07:09.447 --> 07:11.082
Pressure breach!

07:15.187 --> 07:16.718
Pressure breach!
We gotta get to the bulkhead!

07:16.720 --> 07:18.188
Structural
integrity compromised.

07:18.190 --> 07:20.058
Everyone up! Everyone up!
Come on!

07:24.196 --> 07:26.898
Structural integrity
compromised.

07:27.966 --> 07:29.666
What the hell is happening?

07:29.668 --> 07:30.969
Let's go! Pressure breach!

07:33.939 --> 07:35.338
We gotta seal the bulkhead!

07:35.340 --> 07:37.706
<i>De-pressurization
warning.</i>

07:37.708 --> 07:40.176
<i>Seal the bulkhead.</i>

07:40.178 --> 07:42.612
- <i>De-pressurization warning.</i>
- I don't have my keycard!

07:42.614 --> 07:43.848
Here, here, here.

07:45.350 --> 07:46.382
- No!
- <i>Bulkhead jammed.</i>

07:46.384 --> 07:48.618
I gotta get inside
this thing now!

07:48.620 --> 07:50.155
- <i>Reboot required.</i>
- Where is it? Where is it?

07:52.691 --> 07:53.690
Oh, my God!

07:53.692 --> 07:55.391
Come on!

07:55.393 --> 07:59.030
De-pressurization warning.
Seal the bulkhead.

08:00.398 --> 08:01.898
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.166
The whole rig
is about to implode!

08:03.168 --> 08:04.400
If you don't shut these doors,

08:04.402 --> 08:05.902
it'll take the whole station
with us!

08:05.904 --> 08:07.937
Okay! Okay, okay, okay,
got it, got it, got it!

08:07.939 --> 08:09.305
- <i>System online.</i>
- Shut the door!

08:09.307 --> 08:11.474
- Wait!
- Hey, hey, hey.

08:11.476 --> 08:12.475
Wait for us!

08:12.477 --> 08:13.309
- Hey!
- Run!

08:13.311 --> 08:14.844
- Run!
- Come on!

08:14.846 --> 08:16.546
Guys, run! Come on, come on!

08:16.548 --> 08:18.414
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Come on, guys, let's go!

08:18.416 --> 08:19.882
Come on, run!

08:19.884 --> 08:21.951
Norah, Norah!
They're not gonna make it.

08:21.953 --> 08:23.720
- Close the door!
- Norah!

08:23.722 --> 08:25.924
We have to close the door,
otherwise the whole rig will die.

08:29.094 --> 08:30.128
Shut the door now!

09:18.710 --> 09:20.843
<i>Structural failure is imminent</i>

09:20.845 --> 09:22.078
<i>as the result of an...</i>

09:22.080 --> 09:23.515
<i>incident.</i>

09:26.184 --> 09:30.653
<i>To all Kepler Station crew,
structural failure is imminent.</i>

09:30.655 --> 09:34.492
<i>Repeat, structural
failure is imminent.</i>

09:36.261 --> 09:38.628
Hey, hey.

09:38.630 --> 09:39.531
You okay?

09:42.834 --> 09:44.269
Was that an earthquake?

09:45.470 --> 09:46.338
I don't know.

09:49.140 --> 09:51.076
Had to have been like
a ten or eleven.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.377
I don't even know
what channel we'd be...

09:54.379 --> 09:56.946
<i>All personnel
report to pod bays</i>

09:56.948 --> 09:58.816
<i>for immediate evacuation.</i>

10:00.151 --> 10:02.085
This is Kepler.
Control, can you hear me?

10:02.087 --> 10:06.456
Kepler Station
status, 70% compromised.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.091
<i>Reactor unstable.</i>

10:08.093 --> 10:09.492
Control, this is Kepler,
can you hear me?

10:09.494 --> 10:12.763
Kepler Station
status, 70% compromised.

10:12.765 --> 10:14.931
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

10:14.933 --> 10:16.532
Can anyone hear me?

10:27.679 --> 10:28.580
We have to get to the pod bays.

10:29.849 --> 10:30.915
Come on.

10:37.589 --> 10:40.189
As a crew
member, we want you to know

10:40.191 --> 10:42.225
<i>that you're not
just part of a team,</i>

10:42.227 --> 10:44.062
<i>you're part of
our family.</i>

10:48.433 --> 10:50.366
No, no, no.
That doesn't go through.

10:50.368 --> 10:51.835
<i>Have
a complaint?</i>

10:51.837 --> 10:54.239
<i>Address it
to your superior officer.</i>

10:55.775 --> 10:57.173
Oh, yes, working.

10:57.175 --> 10:58.543
I just got to find
the nearest pods.

11:03.948 --> 11:08.451
Senior engineers,
please report to engineering.

11:08.453 --> 11:09.521
Rodrigo, right?

11:11.556 --> 11:12.457
Yeah.

11:12.991 --> 11:14.025
Norah.

11:15.026 --> 11:16.259
I-I know.

11:16.261 --> 11:18.029
I usually work
with the day shift.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.533
- Can you...? Can you help me out here?
- Sure, I can.

11:23.535 --> 11:28.204
Um, are you a computer engineer
or something?

11:28.206 --> 11:29.907
- Mechanical.
- Okay.

11:29.909 --> 11:31.174
I can reset breakers.

11:31.176 --> 11:34.279
I've been down here for a bit.

11:43.087 --> 11:45.054
Hey, you gotta know...

11:45.056 --> 11:46.391
that wasn't our fault.

11:47.559 --> 11:49.592
I mean,
you-you saved the entire rig.

11:49.594 --> 11:51.527
I... I didn't even know
to close the door.

11:51.529 --> 11:52.430
Hmm.

11:58.603 --> 12:00.236
<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

12:00.238 --> 12:03.473
Do you... Do you really think
that was an earthquake?

12:03.475 --> 12:04.309
No.

12:05.977 --> 12:07.378
I-I don't know.

12:10.014 --> 12:11.347
That's not good.

12:11.349 --> 12:13.549
The hardline's been severed.

12:13.551 --> 12:17.019
Antenna's gone. I don't even
think we can reach the surface.

12:17.021 --> 12:19.655
...to the nearest
escape pod as soon as possible.

12:19.657 --> 12:21.760
There's-there's
evac pods in CR-7.

12:29.902 --> 12:31.770
Hey, we got this, all right?

12:40.144 --> 12:42.447
Some of this water
is definitely sewage.

12:53.759 --> 12:55.959
Welcome
aboard the Kepler Station,

12:55.961 --> 12:58.862
<i>located just a mile away
from the Roebuck...</i>

12:58.864 --> 13:01.564
<i>The titan-class
sister station...</i>

13:01.566 --> 13:03.501
<i>The Kepler...
pumps a crude...</i>

13:05.804 --> 13:07.270
There we go.

13:07.272 --> 13:08.738
<i>...and we hope
you enjoy your stay.</i>

13:08.740 --> 13:10.273
Can we...
Can we dig through there?

13:10.275 --> 13:12.074
I'll look inside.

13:27.225 --> 13:29.091
Yeah, I can fit up here,
if you can.

13:29.093 --> 13:30.161
Come check.

13:34.265 --> 13:35.966
Hello?

13:35.968 --> 13:37.235
Can anyone hear me?

13:38.570 --> 13:41.237
Hello? Hello?

13:41.239 --> 13:42.806
Hey, do you hear that?

13:42.808 --> 13:44.707
- Hey!
- Hello!

13:44.709 --> 13:46.377
Hey, keep talking, man.
I can hear you.

13:48.079 --> 13:49.447
I'm under the rock!

13:55.054 --> 13:56.385
Take him, take him.

13:56.387 --> 13:59.455
Paul? Here, here, here, here.
Hey, you.

13:59.457 --> 14:01.290
What's-what's going on
down there? Your legs all right?

14:01.292 --> 14:02.191
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:02.193 --> 14:03.392
What do you need?

14:03.394 --> 14:04.694
To get the heck out of here.

14:04.696 --> 14:06.429
Yeah, yeah, I know.
What can I do?

14:06.431 --> 14:07.800
- All right, all right.
- All right.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.334
- You good?
- Yeah.

14:11.336 --> 14:13.536
All right.

14:13.538 --> 14:14.570
- All right. Here.
- Hey.

14:14.572 --> 14:16.940
- Norah?
- You're good. Hi!

14:16.942 --> 14:18.207
Yes.

14:18.209 --> 14:20.343
You sweet,
flat-chested elven creature.

14:20.345 --> 14:23.646
Okay, just breathe for a second.
You're all good.

14:23.648 --> 14:24.948
- Is Lil Paul okay?
- Yeah, he's cool.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.749
- Let me help you.
- You wanna try to stand up?

14:26.752 --> 14:29.086
- Yeah.
- All right, buddy. Here we go.

14:29.088 --> 14:30.319
Grab his arm?

14:30.321 --> 14:32.154
No, no, no. Wait. No, no.

14:32.156 --> 14:33.556
Okay, are you caught
in anything?

14:33.558 --> 14:35.892
No, no, no,
let's just be stronger.

14:39.999 --> 14:41.297
Okay.

14:41.299 --> 14:42.698
Okay, give me Lil Paul.

14:42.700 --> 14:43.834
- Yeah, here.
- Thank you.

14:43.836 --> 14:45.035
Gotta go.

14:45.037 --> 14:47.303
Okay, I got my robe
and my lucky sock.

14:47.305 --> 14:48.805
What are we doing?

14:48.807 --> 14:49.973
The evac pods in CR-7.

14:49.975 --> 14:51.775
- We're headed there, okay?
- Okay.

14:51.777 --> 14:54.044
The upper decks are collapsing.
We gotta move fast.

14:54.046 --> 14:55.211
Through that thing?

14:55.213 --> 14:57.313
You guys are crazy.

14:57.315 --> 14:58.616
I'm a big boy.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.702
All right. I think...

15:19.704 --> 15:20.638
Hold up.

15:36.521 --> 15:38.356
<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

15:39.357 --> 15:41.158
<i>Flooding contained.</i>

15:41.160 --> 15:42.224
Okay.

15:51.736 --> 15:53.404
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

15:58.476 --> 16:00.877
There's-there's someone up here.

16:00.879 --> 16:02.447
It's... It's McClellen.

16:31.777 --> 16:32.911
Jesus.

16:33.812 --> 16:34.847
Hey, Rod.

16:36.347 --> 16:37.482
Come on, bud.

16:50.062 --> 16:51.527
Guys, I see the pod bay.

16:51.529 --> 16:54.131
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

16:54.133 --> 16:55.700
<i>All Kepler crew...</i>

16:56.769 --> 16:57.901
Cap?

16:57.903 --> 16:59.668
Holy shit.
He stayed behind?

17:01.339 --> 17:02.873
Wait, why's he
just sitting there?

17:02.875 --> 17:04.007
Oh, shit.

17:04.009 --> 17:06.108
"Shit?" What's...
What's "oh shit"? What?

17:06.111 --> 17:07.844
The evac pods are gone.

17:07.846 --> 17:09.614
- I need the line open.
- Captain!

17:13.752 --> 17:14.818
Hey!

17:14.819 --> 17:17.119
Norah. You're alive.

17:17.122 --> 17:18.221
Cap.

17:18.223 --> 17:19.423
The door's jammed.

17:21.926 --> 17:23.358
Rodrigo, Paul.

17:23.361 --> 17:25.661
I need you two to check where
we are on submersible. Now.

17:25.663 --> 17:28.098
All right, all right.

17:28.099 --> 17:31.034
On a scale from one to ten,
how bad's my rig?

17:34.072 --> 17:34.940
Uh, ten.

17:38.342 --> 17:40.143
You're 70% compromised.

17:40.145 --> 17:43.046
Honestly, you-you breathe
too hard in here, we're...

17:44.917 --> 17:46.448
Wait. Let me see.

17:46.450 --> 17:49.052
I don't get it. Was that
like an earthquake or...

17:49.054 --> 17:51.489
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out.

17:53.992 --> 17:55.457
Why are you still here?

17:55.459 --> 17:57.194
You should have gone up.
There were pods here.

17:57.196 --> 17:58.661
'Cause that's what captains do.

17:58.663 --> 18:01.099
Who cares? You have a kid,
you should have gone up.

18:03.601 --> 18:05.304
Can you, uh, can you
sit down, please?

18:07.272 --> 18:08.571
Any one of us would have
shoved your ass

18:08.573 --> 18:09.538
onto that pod immediately.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.774
Listen to me.

18:10.776 --> 18:12.242
Everybody's getting out
of here alive,

18:12.244 --> 18:13.409
you hear me?

18:13.411 --> 18:14.579
Okay?

18:16.148 --> 18:17.348
Hold that on your ear.

18:19.517 --> 18:21.350
I already sent 22 up.

18:21.352 --> 18:22.484
Smith reported seven dead.

18:22.486 --> 18:23.854
I found three.

18:23.856 --> 18:26.589
It was, it was Lee,
Travis and McClellen,

18:26.591 --> 18:28.390
and, um, um, McCl...

18:28.392 --> 18:29.759
McClellen's hands
were still warm

18:29.761 --> 18:31.627
so I-I know it was McClellen.

18:31.629 --> 18:33.562
I mean, she lives
three floors up,

18:33.564 --> 18:35.531
and I was brushing my teeth,
like, two hours ago.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.267
- I-I had to shut the door on the entire East wing.
- Don't do this to yourself.

18:37.269 --> 18:39.135
So, actually, you know what,
there could be more.

18:39.137 --> 18:40.436
Stop thinking back,
look forward.

18:40.438 --> 18:42.906
Look forward. Look at me.

18:42.908 --> 18:46.209
Now you follow the light.
Come on.

18:46.211 --> 18:47.813
Follow the light.
<i>Ça va ça va.</i>

18:49.614 --> 18:51.915
<i>Cap,
that isa no-go on the submersibles.</i>

18:51.917 --> 18:53.083
<i>Copy that.</i>

18:53.085 --> 18:55.020
<i>I'm sending Norah
to the control room.</i>

19:00.225 --> 19:02.058
Emily, are you okay? Hey.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.492
- Oh, my gosh. You're alive.
- Norah?

19:03.494 --> 19:04.729
- Hey.
- You're alive.

19:05.730 --> 19:07.264
- Dude.
- Ah, I hate that.

19:07.266 --> 19:09.099
- Have you heard anything?
- No, no. Nothing.

19:11.136 --> 19:12.936
- How are the cooling towers?
- I haven't checked 'em yet.

19:12.938 --> 19:14.004
- You wanna do it?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:14.006 --> 19:15.906
See if anybody's
alive out there.

19:15.908 --> 19:17.506
<i>...compromised.</i>

19:17.508 --> 19:19.644
<i>Bulkheads closed...</i>

19:21.013 --> 19:22.413
Hey, hey.

19:26.151 --> 19:28.218
Someone's coming. Right?

19:28.220 --> 19:29.753
They're gonna...
They're gonna send someone.

19:29.755 --> 19:31.221
I don't know. Thank you.

19:31.223 --> 19:32.989
I'm pretty sure
they already sent someone.

19:32.991 --> 19:36.026
I'm less sure we have the time
to wait for them.

19:36.028 --> 19:37.127
- Norah.
- Yeah.

19:37.129 --> 19:40.596
So, the cooling towers?
What are we getting?

19:42.000 --> 19:42.999
Oh, um...

19:44.202 --> 19:45.835
Nothing good.

19:45.837 --> 19:47.469
All the upper decks
have collapsed

19:47.471 --> 19:49.738
and we lost the cooling towers.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.775
The core of the Kepler
is completely unstable.

19:51.777 --> 19:53.009
Wait, what do you
mean "unstable"?

19:53.011 --> 19:54.476
Like, poof,
we all die "unstable"?

19:54.478 --> 19:55.444
What are we
talking about here, Norah?

19:55.446 --> 19:57.280
The thermal cores.

19:57.282 --> 19:59.115
That's a lot of energy
with nowhere to go.

19:59.117 --> 20:00.917
Okay, the intern's
freaking me out.

20:00.919 --> 20:02.651
Can somebody just explain
what the hell's going on here?

20:02.653 --> 20:03.987
Research assistant.

20:03.989 --> 20:05.688
No, there-there... There's a...
There's a, um...

20:05.690 --> 20:06.923
If there's a meltdown,
there's gonna be a lot of heat.

20:06.925 --> 20:08.691
There's gonna be
a flash boil, explosions.

20:08.693 --> 20:10.794
I don't really know. I watch a
lot of anime. That's all I know.

20:10.796 --> 20:12.362
Oh, you watch anime?
I like anime.

20:15.367 --> 20:16.732
No, I mean, he's right.

20:16.734 --> 20:18.868
We have about 30 minutes
till meltdown.

20:18.870 --> 20:21.805
And, uh, it's gonna blow us
into tiny pieces to the surface.

20:21.807 --> 20:24.040
And people are gonna find us,
like, floating around.

20:24.042 --> 20:26.443
<i>Bulkhead compromised.</i>

20:26.445 --> 20:28.178
Okay, guys, listen.

20:28.180 --> 20:31.348
The escape pods are gone
and the sub is out of order.

20:31.350 --> 20:33.716
And we're not getting
any more radio signals.

20:33.718 --> 20:35.819
And the structure of the Kepler
is totally unsound.

20:35.821 --> 20:37.619
Captain, there better be
a good punchline,

20:37.621 --> 20:38.687
'cause this setup is...

20:38.689 --> 20:40.058
- So weak.
- ...weak.

20:42.693 --> 20:44.361
We go for the Roebuck.

20:44.363 --> 20:46.196
The Roebuck?

20:46.198 --> 20:47.897
It's a mile down
and a mile that way.

20:47.899 --> 20:49.466
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

20:49.468 --> 20:50.969
How would we even get there?

20:53.238 --> 20:54.304
We walk.

20:54.306 --> 20:55.372
We what?

20:55.374 --> 20:56.406
Walk.

20:56.408 --> 20:58.008
We walk?

20:58.010 --> 21:00.143
That's what you dug me
out of the rubble for?

21:00.145 --> 21:01.211
I can't walk.

21:01.213 --> 21:02.345
I don't even have a suit.

21:02.347 --> 21:04.481
Listen, listen. Listen to me.

21:04.483 --> 21:07.150
Here's what we're gonna do.

21:07.152 --> 21:10.253
We're gonna drop down to the
cargo elevator to the seafloor.

21:10.255 --> 21:14.024
Then we use the access tunnel
to get to the Midpoint station.

21:14.026 --> 21:16.993
There we can charge
and clean the rebreathers.

21:16.995 --> 21:19.162
And then we follow the markers

21:19.164 --> 21:22.098
across the plateau
to the Roebuck.

21:24.870 --> 21:26.469
So we just go in the pitch black

21:26.471 --> 21:28.271
and we walk without knowing
where we're going

21:28.273 --> 21:29.538
with insufficient oxygen?

21:29.540 --> 21:31.007
- That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

21:31.009 --> 21:32.541
Everybody down with that?
Norah, you okay with that?

21:32.543 --> 21:34.778
The suits can't be down there
that long. You know that.

21:34.780 --> 21:37.280
Not everyone here
is an experienced diver and...

21:37.282 --> 21:38.381
Than we never know.

21:38.383 --> 21:39.851
I'm-I'm not trying to be...

21:41.119 --> 21:43.086
Can you just admit
we might die doing that?

21:43.088 --> 21:46.590
Yeah. But can you admit
that we might live doing this?

21:47.793 --> 21:49.225
Hey, what about
the old Shepard Station?

21:49.227 --> 21:50.527
Isn't that closer?

21:50.529 --> 21:53.329
Shepard Station's gone.
There's nothing there.

21:53.331 --> 21:56.301
Uh, you guys,
you need to hear this.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.170
Can this be
something good?

22:00.172 --> 22:02.138
Could we please have
one good thing? Could we?

22:02.140 --> 22:04.673
I think this was the last
transmission from the drill site.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.745
<i>Mayday, mayday!</i>

22:09.747 --> 22:12.215
<i>We've been compromised by category ten...</i>

22:23.627 --> 22:25.128
Now, what the hell
was that noise?

22:28.366 --> 22:30.867
Also, the temperature outside
jumped ten degrees.

22:30.869 --> 22:33.870
Great, so it'll be warm when
we're walking across the plateau.

22:33.872 --> 22:35.805
The water doesn't do that.
That's impossible.

22:38.076 --> 22:41.077
That's just aftershocks
from the last earthquake, okay?

22:41.079 --> 22:42.946
It's 'cause
we drilled too deep. Okay?

22:42.948 --> 22:44.848
It's those tectonic plates
I talk about all the time.

22:44.850 --> 22:47.649
This is insane.
Okay, this is insane.

22:47.651 --> 22:49.087
We go for the Roebuck.

22:59.397 --> 23:01.297
What? If we're gonna
do this, let's do it!

23:01.299 --> 23:02.234
Am I right?

23:04.936 --> 23:06.635
All right, we can compromise.
I can turn it down.

23:08.206 --> 23:09.439
Emily.

23:09.441 --> 23:11.343
Lose your pants.
They won't fit in the suit.

23:14.112 --> 23:16.014
<i>Deck A compromised.</i>

23:18.416 --> 23:20.383
<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

23:20.385 --> 23:21.920
<i>Flooding contained.</i>

23:35.967 --> 23:37.969
Has anyone ever
walked out there before?

23:40.172 --> 23:42.174
Longer than to fix a pipe.
I mean, just...

23:43.741 --> 23:44.876
Just walked?

23:46.178 --> 23:47.012
No.

23:49.047 --> 23:50.712
Check if we have enough helmets.

23:50.714 --> 23:52.716
I just need you to find
six good ones.

23:58.056 --> 23:59.157
Hey, Norah.

23:59.723 --> 24:01.257
Hey.

24:01.259 --> 24:02.861
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

24:04.896 --> 24:06.932
Hey. How you doing?

24:07.532 --> 24:08.765
You ready?

24:08.767 --> 24:09.868
All right.

24:19.211 --> 24:21.012
These are ripped too? Come on!

24:30.755 --> 24:31.923
All right, this is gonna suck.

24:32.657 --> 24:34.090
Okay.

24:34.092 --> 24:35.892
Oh, sorry, sorry!

24:35.894 --> 24:38.261
Okay. Good?

24:38.263 --> 24:39.231
Go suit up.

24:44.735 --> 24:45.937
Your air is good.

24:56.281 --> 24:57.580
Thank you.

24:57.582 --> 24:59.784
Okay, clear
all this shit from the deck.

25:10.562 --> 25:12.095
What are you thinking?

25:12.097 --> 25:13.062
I'm thinking
I really didn't like

25:13.064 --> 25:15.498
the sound on that transmission.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.534
We should take something.

25:19.237 --> 25:20.171
Yeah.

25:20.972 --> 25:23.039
That's a very valid point.

25:23.041 --> 25:25.875
Okay. Let me see your back.

25:25.877 --> 25:27.379
Okay. Last checks.

25:29.314 --> 25:30.148
Let's go.

25:32.717 --> 25:34.717
All right, listen up.

25:34.719 --> 25:38.321
We watch our descent rate
and follow all safety protocols.

25:38.323 --> 25:40.859
Remember,
these suits are dangerous.

25:44.296 --> 25:45.897
Hey, what's so funny?

25:50.001 --> 25:52.635
- I can't do this. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

25:52.637 --> 25:55.104
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

25:55.106 --> 25:57.874
It's all right. It's all right.
It's just an elevator, all right?

25:57.876 --> 25:59.676
It's all lit up
to the weigh station.

25:59.678 --> 26:00.677
You just follow the pipeline.

26:00.679 --> 26:03.446
You can do it. Come on, come on.

26:03.448 --> 26:05.450
Hey, what's the scariest
part of a roller coaster?

26:06.518 --> 26:08.251
Waiting in line.

26:09.688 --> 26:10.555
Ready?

26:12.257 --> 26:14.691
I'm gonna be right there
with you. Every step.

26:14.693 --> 26:16.659
<i>Main bridge compromised.</i>

26:16.661 --> 26:17.829
We have to move.

26:18.997 --> 26:20.897
All right.
Everybody in the pool.

26:20.899 --> 26:22.198
Okay, we gotta go.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.233
That was one level above us.

26:24.235 --> 26:26.035
This one's next. Let's go.

26:26.037 --> 26:27.839
<i>...integrity compromised.</i>

26:29.174 --> 26:32.675
<i>Structural integrity
compromised.</i>

26:32.677 --> 26:33.609
<i>Take us down.</i>

26:33.611 --> 26:35.345
<i>"If you don't know
where you're going,</i>

26:35.347 --> 26:37.647

26:37.649 --> 26:38.816
<i>Dude.</i>

26:38.818 --> 26:40.450
<i>What? It's not me, Norah.
It's from a book.</i>

26:40.452 --> 26:41.417
<i>Let's go.</i>

26:42.921 --> 26:44.189
<i>We all know you
can't read.</i>

27:12.517 --> 27:14.217
All right,
I don't wanna scare anyone,

27:14.219 --> 27:15.585
<i>but once we get
to the depth</i>

27:15.587 --> 27:17.555
<i>we're gonna have to
jump to the cargo lift.</i>

27:21.926 --> 27:24.327
<i>Okay, here we go.
Shit.</i>

27:24.329 --> 27:26.929
Exterior hatch,
it's ripped to shreds.

27:26.931 --> 27:28.030
<i>Everybody, get ready.</i>

27:28.032 --> 27:29.165
<i>Hang onto
something 'cause</i>

27:29.167 --> 27:31.167
<i>pressure's gonna
hit us hard.</i>

27:31.169 --> 27:32.268
<i>Override it.</i>

27:32.270 --> 27:33.905
<i>As long as it opens,
we'll be fine.</i>

27:35.673 --> 27:37.940
Captain, I don't know
what's going on with this thing.

27:37.942 --> 27:38.842
<i>Well,
keep trying.</i>

27:41.913 --> 27:42.880
<i>Rodrigo.</i>

27:42.882 --> 27:44.180
<i>Guys, what's going on?</i>

27:44.182 --> 27:46.050
<i>Keep the door closed.
Keep the door closed!</i>

27:58.096 --> 28:00.532
Stay where you are.
Close your eyes.

28:02.267 --> 28:04.669
It's okay, Em.
You're good, you're good.

28:07.105 --> 28:08.806
<i>Listen. Listen.</i>

28:08.808 --> 28:10.706
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

28:47.880 --> 28:50.379
Let's go, Emily.
Step to the edge.

28:50.381 --> 28:51.583
<i>You have to jump now.</i>

28:53.985 --> 28:56.020
<i>Norah, he's gone.</i>

28:57.422 --> 28:59.090
<i>It's your turn.
You need to jump.</i>

29:17.275 --> 29:19.475
He knew that
that helmet was faulty.

29:19.477 --> 29:21.079
I mean, I-I-I know
that he knew it.

29:21.513 --> 29:22.745
Listen.

29:22.747 --> 29:25.381
I know how you feel.
I know it's unfair.

29:27.685 --> 29:29.953
But you're gonna have to
take it and use it.

29:29.955 --> 29:31.623
Yeah. Okay.

29:32.825 --> 29:33.689
Come on.

29:33.691 --> 29:34.490
The sooner we get clear

29:34.492 --> 29:35.627
of the station the better.

30:02.053 --> 30:04.088
I've never seen
anyone die before.

30:07.358 --> 30:09.193
I saw somebody die.

30:11.462 --> 30:13.431
I've never seen anybody implode.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.672
What are you laughing at?

30:22.674 --> 30:24.041
Uh, I was just
thinking of this thing

30:24.043 --> 30:26.142
that Rodrigo did sometimes.

30:26.144 --> 30:27.476
He'd always say
he had a new joke,

30:27.478 --> 30:29.445
and then he'd tell
the same stupid joke.

30:29.447 --> 30:32.785
I was... laughing at that joke.

30:34.053 --> 30:35.685
Yeah, what was it?

30:35.687 --> 30:38.654
What did the fish say when
it bumped into the brick wall?

30:42.093 --> 30:43.161
"Dam."

30:44.964 --> 30:46.797
Pretty stupid joke.

31:08.653 --> 31:10.152
It looks like
whatever it is

31:10.154 --> 31:11.755
might be on the deck below us.

31:13.826 --> 31:17.060
I think it's a distress signal
from one of the pods.

31:17.062 --> 31:18.296
How far?

31:19.130 --> 31:20.897
Two hundred more meters.

31:20.899 --> 31:23.199
Why wouldn't it be
going to the surface?

31:23.201 --> 31:24.602
Maybe it's only got
half a charge.

31:25.904 --> 31:27.370
Uh...

31:27.372 --> 31:29.173
It's definitely stopped
on the platform below us.

31:29.875 --> 31:30.776
Survivor.

31:31.476 --> 31:32.845
It could be a survivor.

31:34.746 --> 31:37.546
Guys, somebody's gonna
have to suit up.

31:37.548 --> 31:39.515
All right, Emily,
this is your time.

31:39.517 --> 31:40.485
What?

31:41.352 --> 31:42.487
I'm just messing with you.

31:44.355 --> 31:46.457
Here, take him.

31:48.192 --> 31:49.793
Take this bunny.

31:49.795 --> 31:50.829
I bequeath it to you.

31:51.897 --> 31:54.064
If he doesn't make it,
I'll haunt you.

31:54.066 --> 31:55.498
Let's go, guys.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.768
We don't know how long
until the Kepler blows.

31:57.770 --> 31:59.702
Let's go put
our lives in danger.

31:59.704 --> 32:01.539
- Be careful.
- We'll be right back.

32:04.409 --> 32:07.077
Paul's crazy. Right?

32:07.079 --> 32:10.113
Yeah. I guess so.

32:10.115 --> 32:12.314
<i>Hey,
Captain, what do we do?</i>

32:12.316 --> 32:13.917
With the body, when we find it.

32:13.919 --> 32:16.053
We're talking about
a possible survivor, Paul.

32:16.055 --> 32:17.253
<i>Okay.</i>

32:17.255 --> 32:18.989
<i>Then hypothetically.</i>

32:18.991 --> 32:21.724
<i>Let's say we were to come
across a body and it was dead.</i>

32:21.726 --> 32:24.861
Just grab something
we can take back to his family.

32:24.863 --> 32:26.431
<i>It's okay. I
know what to do.</i>

32:28.366 --> 32:30.633
Oh, really?
We got G.I. Joe over here.

32:30.635 --> 32:33.269
And we are about to touch...

32:33.271 --> 32:38.141
in three, two, one.

32:41.980 --> 32:42.979
We're locked in.

32:42.981 --> 32:43.980
<i>All right.</i>

32:43.982 --> 32:44.983
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Yeah.

32:46.517 --> 32:48.484
<i>Yeah. Yeah!</i>

32:48.486 --> 32:50.153
Let's get this done
before the Kepler

32:50.155 --> 32:51.387
<i>comes down on our asses.</i>

32:51.389 --> 32:52.923
Okay.

32:52.925 --> 32:56.726
Turn on all the camera feeds
we have available.

32:56.728 --> 32:58.895
How long can
someone survive in a pod?

32:58.897 --> 33:00.799
If he lost power, not long.

33:02.167 --> 33:03.668
Especially at this depth.

33:05.436 --> 33:07.971
Okay, guys, we're starting
the decompression now.

33:07.973 --> 33:10.274
Are either of you two married?

33:12.978 --> 33:14.410
Was.

33:14.412 --> 33:15.413
Kids?

33:16.115 --> 33:17.180
Daughter.

33:17.182 --> 33:18.247
How-how old is she?

33:18.249 --> 33:19.850
Fourteen.

33:19.852 --> 33:21.517
That's a tough age for a girl.

33:21.519 --> 33:23.856
I mean, it's-it's a phase.
It will pass.

33:24.489 --> 33:26.056
She's not 14.

33:26.058 --> 33:28.324
Allie? She's gotta be
like my age, right?

33:28.326 --> 33:30.294
Who said 14? Did I say that?

33:31.096 --> 33:32.328
Yeah.

33:32.330 --> 33:34.330
Well, I don't know
why I said it.

33:34.332 --> 33:35.531
You're losing it, old man.

33:35.533 --> 33:37.067
You're going senile down here.

33:37.069 --> 33:40.669
It's actually a normal
neurological reaction.

33:40.671 --> 33:41.772
When you're facing death,
time just...

33:41.774 --> 33:42.908
Listen to me. Listen to me.

33:44.742 --> 33:46.979
You're not gonna die. Okay?

33:50.381 --> 33:51.449
<i>All right.</i>

33:52.117 --> 33:54.084
<i>Worst idea ever.</i>

33:54.086 --> 33:56.485
<i>Let's do it anyway.</i>

33:56.487 --> 33:58.287
<i>Helmets on.
Locked and loaded.</i>

33:58.289 --> 33:59.555
Either of you have dogs?

33:59.557 --> 34:00.656
<i>Flood it, Norah!</i>

34:00.658 --> 34:02.658
Flooding.

34:04.830 --> 34:05.764
I have a corgi.

34:07.800 --> 34:11.902
Not house-trained, so he's
kind of a nightmare right now,

34:11.904 --> 34:13.735
but I didn't think
I would miss him this much.

34:13.737 --> 34:16.674
Okay, hatch is sealed.
We're outside.

34:18.609 --> 34:19.945
Okay, I'll put us on standby.

34:21.045 --> 34:22.380
Turn the floodlights on, please.

34:32.958 --> 34:35.826
Cap, this platform's
not too stable.

34:35.828 --> 34:37.996
<i>I, uh, don't know how long
we should be out here.</i>

34:51.043 --> 34:52.677
<i>Oh, God.</i>

34:57.448 --> 35:00.050
Guys, keep on walking forward.

35:00.052 --> 35:01.284
Like 20 meters.

35:01.286 --> 35:02.687
<i>Check what's
on the right.</i>

35:06.225 --> 35:09.092
<i>I can't see shit.
My right or his right?</i>

35:14.699 --> 35:15.533
<i>What the
hell is that?</i>

35:19.771 --> 35:21.403
<i>Am I cracking up
or is there, like,</i>

35:21.405 --> 35:23.041
<i>like, a bird
chirping right now?</i>

35:24.276 --> 35:26.377
We're not hearing
anything up here.

35:30.115 --> 35:32.715
All right,
Captain, talk to us.

35:32.717 --> 35:34.683
<i>We close? We can't see
anything out here.</i>

35:34.685 --> 35:37.022
Honestly, you should be
right in front of it.

35:38.257 --> 35:39.091
<i>Okay.</i>

35:43.161 --> 35:44.695
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

35:52.470 --> 35:53.537
<i>Oh, hold up.</i>

35:54.572 --> 35:55.774
<i>You see that?</i>

35:56.875 --> 35:59.276
<i>Holy shit.</i>

35:59.278 --> 36:00.846
<i>What the hell
happened to this thing?</i>

36:04.448 --> 36:07.886
<i>Looks like it imploded.
There's, uh, something.</i>

36:10.289 --> 36:11.622
<i>Something all over it.</i>

36:12.623 --> 36:13.691
<i>You seeing this?</i>

36:16.194 --> 36:17.559
What is that?

36:17.561 --> 36:18.795
I would need to take
a closer look.

36:18.797 --> 36:20.830
It could be
some sort of an-an algae.

36:20.832 --> 36:22.433
You ever see
anything like that?

36:23.769 --> 36:25.601
<i>This looks...</i>

36:25.603 --> 36:27.005
<i>It doesn't look
like algae.</i>

36:28.472 --> 36:30.572
Is there anybody in it?

36:30.574 --> 36:31.542
<i>Empty.</i>

36:32.576 --> 36:33.744
<i>I got something.</i>

36:35.613 --> 36:36.580
<i>Wallet.</i>

36:39.184 --> 36:41.153
<i>Great. We can use
his credit cards.</i>

36:45.157 --> 36:46.722
<i>All right, Captain,
there's no body,</i>

36:46.724 --> 36:48.124
<i>so can we please
and thank you</i>

36:48.126 --> 36:49.928
<i>get the hell out of here
before we...</i>

36:52.130 --> 36:54.331
<i>Scratch that. There's a body.
It's entangled...</i>

36:54.333 --> 36:55.564
They should just come back.

36:55.566 --> 36:56.835
<i>...in the coils.</i>

37:04.276 --> 37:06.076
Dude, don't check it out.
Just come back.

37:06.078 --> 37:07.509
- Just come back.
- <i>Wait.</i>

37:07.511 --> 37:08.746
<i>Do you see his back?</i>

37:13.452 --> 37:16.485
- <i>Can you guys see that?</i>
- Let's just bring them back.

37:16.487 --> 37:17.586
Okay, come back, guys.

37:17.588 --> 37:18.589
<i>Paul.</i>

37:20.125 --> 37:21.592
<i>Whoa. Smith.</i>

37:23.228 --> 37:24.162
Paul.

37:28.066 --> 37:29.968
The hell's going on
with his body?

37:32.636 --> 37:36.473
<i>Did the pressure...
liquefy...</i>

37:39.111 --> 37:40.678
<i>Paul, hold
still! God!</i>

37:45.817 --> 37:47.817
What is that thing?

37:47.819 --> 37:49.651
All I know is that it was
eating a dead body

37:49.653 --> 37:51.123
and then it came at me.

37:55.427 --> 37:57.327
Em, what are you doing?

37:57.329 --> 37:59.029
Uh, I'm just looking for its...

37:59.031 --> 38:00.696
Oh, no, no!

38:00.698 --> 38:02.365
See?

38:02.367 --> 38:03.802
Looking for its mouth.

38:07.705 --> 38:08.905
Is it still alive?

38:08.907 --> 38:10.774
- No, no, no.
- 'Cause I will kill it.

38:10.776 --> 38:12.375
I think I just touched a nerve.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.412
Norah, how much
further do we have?

38:15.414 --> 38:17.280
Two hundred meters
away from the bottom.

38:18.283 --> 38:19.681
It doesn't have any eyes.

38:19.683 --> 38:21.617
How are they attracted
to the light?

38:21.619 --> 38:22.886
Oh, my God, look at this.

38:22.888 --> 38:24.720
Maybe they're like moths.

38:24.722 --> 38:26.722
Underwater moths.

38:26.724 --> 38:28.825
It's like talons.

38:28.827 --> 38:30.794
I think this might be
a new species.

38:30.796 --> 38:32.429
Do we get to name it?

38:32.431 --> 38:33.997
I shot it. I'm naming it.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.071
I've never seen
sea life like this down here.

38:43.375 --> 38:47.210
Unless... Unless we bored
into a hydrothermal pocket.

38:47.212 --> 38:50.048
If it was sustained heat
that could support life...

38:50.882 --> 38:52.148
Are you serious?

38:52.150 --> 38:55.251
Everybody stay calm. Stay calm.

38:55.253 --> 38:57.220
- Oh, my God.
- Norah, what'd you get?

38:57.222 --> 38:58.654
Nothing.
It's not just the lights.

38:58.656 --> 39:00.457
The whole system's down.

39:00.459 --> 39:02.258
Can you put us in neutral?
Glide the rest of the way?

39:02.260 --> 39:03.095
Yeah.

39:07.299 --> 39:08.965
We have access to the cable?

39:08.967 --> 39:11.334
If we can disengage, definitely.

39:14.973 --> 39:16.174
What was that?

39:36.928 --> 39:38.627
This better not be some

39:38.629 --> 39:41.066
<i>Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea</i> shit, man.

40:00.051 --> 40:00.984
- Paul.
- What the hell?

40:00.986 --> 40:01.885
I'm just joking.

40:01.887 --> 40:02.886
But it does sound like

40:02.888 --> 40:04.055
there's something out there.

40:10.195 --> 40:14.164
It's probably not a good time
to ask, but is that a baby?

40:25.544 --> 40:27.177
Should we close that door?

40:33.385 --> 40:36.421
I'm gonna close it.
I'm gonna close that door.

40:57.309 --> 40:58.176
Okay.

41:00.779 --> 41:02.645
We gotta find a way to get down.

41:02.647 --> 41:04.983
We're completely disengaged.
I don't know why we're not moving yet.

41:18.630 --> 41:20.863
Oh, my God!

41:20.865 --> 41:22.000
What the hell was that?

41:24.202 --> 41:25.969
- Oh, my God!
- The Kepler exploded!

41:25.971 --> 41:26.970
The Kepler!

41:26.972 --> 41:28.739
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

41:31.209 --> 41:32.143
Captain!

41:33.311 --> 41:34.777
Into the pressure chamber!

41:34.779 --> 41:35.814
Oh, God!

41:39.651 --> 41:41.050
We have to open
the outside hatch

41:41.052 --> 41:42.585
before we hit the seafloor!

41:42.587 --> 41:44.456
Or we get crushed! Move!

41:47.926 --> 41:49.892
Flood it! Flood it!

41:54.199 --> 41:55.767
Helmet, now!
Here we go! Come on!

41:56.601 --> 41:57.734
<i>Help!</i>

41:57.736 --> 41:59.102
<i>Hang on!</i>

41:59.104 --> 42:00.903
Here we go.
Open the hatch!

42:00.905 --> 42:01.840
<i>All right.</i>

42:11.549 --> 42:13.885
<i>Run! Run! Run!</i>

42:18.723 --> 42:20.325
<i>Watch it! Watch it!</i>

42:24.863 --> 42:25.864
<i>Norah.</i>

42:30.135 --> 42:31.868
<i>Hey, guys!
I'm over here.</i>

42:31.870 --> 42:34.205
<i>Come to the green light.
I'm at the entrance.</i>

42:35.340 --> 42:36.973
<i>Watch out, Smith!</i>

42:36.975 --> 42:38.076
<i>Emily, watch
out!</i>

42:40.278 --> 42:41.477
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

42:41.479 --> 42:42.345
<i>Keep 'em closed.</i>

42:42.347 --> 42:43.448
<i>I don't know
what happened.</i>

42:45.884 --> 42:47.383
<i>Come on, take him.</i>

42:47.385 --> 42:48.951
<i>To the pipeline entrance!</i>

42:48.953 --> 42:50.088
<i>Come on.</i>

42:56.294 --> 42:59.228
I can't get
the goddamn door open!

42:59.230 --> 43:00.630
<i>Smith, can you hear me?</i>

43:00.632 --> 43:03.468
<i>It's gonna be okay, buddy.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

43:20.318 --> 43:21.617
<i>Come on.</i>

43:21.619 --> 43:23.286
<i>Let's get him clear
of the door!</i>

43:23.288 --> 43:24.520
<i>Get him up. Get him up.</i>

43:27.292 --> 43:28.691
Get him up.
Get him up. Get him up.

43:30.228 --> 43:32.261
What happened? Are you okay?

43:32.263 --> 43:33.696
He inhaled some fumes.
He's okay.

43:33.698 --> 43:35.598
His oxygen scrubber took a hit.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.501
We all saw this, right?
There are things out there.

43:38.503 --> 43:40.171
Fuck our lives!

43:49.547 --> 43:50.814
See?
There's something out there.

43:50.816 --> 43:52.248
Oh, my God.

43:52.250 --> 43:55.218
Paul, stop.
It's just debris falling.

43:55.220 --> 43:57.055
Norah, call the mover.

43:57.622 --> 43:58.456
All right.

44:00.992 --> 44:02.492
Look at me.

44:02.494 --> 44:03.561
How's your sight?

44:04.429 --> 44:05.561
I'm good.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.566
- It's gonna be all right, man.
- Okay.

44:10.568 --> 44:12.504
I don't have the code.
I-I can't get in here.

44:18.676 --> 44:19.511
Ears.

44:20.780 --> 44:21.613
Eh, forget it.

44:27.051 --> 44:29.185
- Give me your hand.
- Two, three!

44:41.366 --> 44:44.367
It's gonna be fine, buddy. Yeah.

44:44.369 --> 44:46.971
All right. We ride this
to the Midpoint Station.

44:51.709 --> 44:52.977
We're halfway there, guys.

44:53.813 --> 44:54.946
Halfway there.

45:25.778 --> 45:27.109
Paul, stop the cart.

45:27.111 --> 45:28.379
It's not gonna go
in that kind of water.

45:29.047 --> 45:30.114
Stop it.

45:35.186 --> 45:36.719
That's a lot of water.

45:36.721 --> 45:38.254
The pumps are probably jammed.

45:38.256 --> 45:40.456
What happens
if they don't turn back on?

45:40.458 --> 45:43.092
Anybody else wanna take that?

45:43.094 --> 45:44.227
No?

45:44.229 --> 45:46.362
In the book, Alice cried so much

45:46.364 --> 45:48.866
she almost drowned
in her own tears.

45:48.868 --> 45:51.067
Luckily, she could swim.

45:51.069 --> 45:52.803
It got pretty rough
for her after that.

45:57.542 --> 45:59.444
There's definitely
something following us.

46:03.414 --> 46:06.150
Okay. I'm getting very close
to shitting myself.

46:24.202 --> 46:26.770
Looks like somebody got
a care package.

46:26.772 --> 46:28.373
Cheetos and...

46:29.274 --> 46:30.575
Oh, the irony.

46:34.112 --> 46:35.547
I love MoonPies.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.420
This is someone's stuff.

46:47.091 --> 46:48.624
This is all someone's...

46:48.626 --> 46:49.494
Oh...

46:51.162 --> 46:52.228
Oh...

46:52.230 --> 46:53.331
Oh, my God.

47:12.083 --> 47:14.185
Keep moving. Keep moving.

47:15.219 --> 47:17.653
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:17.655 --> 47:19.990
Come on, guys,
we're almost there.

47:19.992 --> 47:21.392
It should be 300 meters ahead.

47:37.208 --> 47:38.842
Is this it?

47:38.844 --> 47:40.276
We can't go back.

47:40.278 --> 47:41.412
What does that mean?

47:42.213 --> 47:43.381
It's too tight.

47:44.182 --> 47:45.648
Oh, no.

47:45.650 --> 47:47.383
We've got to find
another way.

47:47.385 --> 47:49.153
I'm the smallest. Let me check.

47:50.055 --> 47:50.889
Here.

47:52.256 --> 47:53.924
Okay.

47:53.926 --> 47:55.426
Let me connect you with my line.

47:56.694 --> 47:57.562
Attached.

48:01.599 --> 48:02.433
Thank you.

48:31.496 --> 48:33.930
All right, I'm through.
It's open out here.

48:33.932 --> 48:35.531
And I think you guys
can definitely make it.

48:35.533 --> 48:36.900
It's really tight but...

48:36.902 --> 48:38.467
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Huh?

48:38.469 --> 48:39.368
<i>We're sending Emily.</i>

48:39.370 --> 48:40.405
Yeah, okay.

48:41.172 --> 48:42.306
Attached.

48:54.452 --> 48:55.284
<i>Captain's
on his way.</i>

48:55.286 --> 48:56.320
Hey, come here.

48:59.024 --> 48:59.858
Nice.

49:06.932 --> 49:08.131
Hey.

49:08.133 --> 49:09.699
How you holding up?

49:09.701 --> 49:10.535
I'm okay.

49:12.004 --> 49:13.937
Um, I was gonna eat this,

49:13.939 --> 49:15.906
but Lil Paul and I decided

49:15.908 --> 49:17.608
that you should
give it to your girl.

49:18.609 --> 49:19.912
- MoonPie.
- Yeah.

49:20.846 --> 49:21.914
MoonPie.

49:23.448 --> 49:24.815
Thanks, man.

49:24.817 --> 49:26.749
She's pretty cool.

49:26.752 --> 49:28.821
Gotta make sure
not to screw that up.

49:30.923 --> 49:31.757
Yeah.

49:38.764 --> 49:40.063
Smith.

49:40.065 --> 49:41.297
<i>Your turn. Come on.</i>

49:41.299 --> 49:43.334
All right, Cap's through.
I'm going.

49:46.738 --> 49:48.841
<i>All right, guys.
I'm coming through.</i>

49:55.646 --> 49:57.646
How are you doing in there, buddy?

49:57.648 --> 49:59.017
You want your bunny heater?

50:08.559 --> 50:10.461
All right, forget this.
We're going in.

50:13.065 --> 50:14.263
Hey. You okay?

50:14.265 --> 50:15.466
- Paul, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

50:16.434 --> 50:17.668
- You okay?
- Yeah.

50:19.972 --> 50:21.270
- <i>What is that?</i>
- Huh?

50:21.272 --> 50:22.839
Paul?
Paul, are you reading?

50:22.841 --> 50:24.640
Don't screw around. Let's go.

50:24.642 --> 50:26.442
Hey, Paul, you copy?

50:26.444 --> 50:28.310
We're gonna pull you through.

50:28.312 --> 50:29.745
- All right, pull.
- All right.

50:29.747 --> 50:30.581
Here we go.

50:40.358 --> 50:42.426
- Come on.
- I'm pulling. I'm pulling.

50:43.195 --> 50:44.360
Come on.

50:44.362 --> 50:45.463
Shit!

50:46.965 --> 50:47.966
Come on, come on.

50:52.537 --> 50:53.970
There he is.

50:53.972 --> 50:55.939
You scared the shit out of me.

50:55.941 --> 50:58.541
There's something back there.
Some Slender Man-type shit.

50:58.543 --> 50:59.642
Hey, that's not funny.

51:01.679 --> 51:02.881
What's wrong with my line?

51:06.517 --> 51:07.751
Smith, unclip.
He's all tangled up.

51:07.753 --> 51:08.719
- Okay, I got it.
- Oh, no!

51:11.023 --> 51:11.990
Unclip, unclip, unclip!

51:13.391 --> 51:14.490
Take Lil Paul! Take Lil Paul!

51:14.492 --> 51:15.591
Give me my helmet!

51:15.593 --> 51:17.393
It's pulling me underwater!

51:17.395 --> 51:18.627
He's going! Helmet!

51:18.629 --> 51:19.428
- My helmet!
- Helmet, now!

51:19.430 --> 51:20.698
Get it on! Get it on!

51:21.632 --> 51:22.667
Grab him! Grab him!

51:31.109 --> 51:32.376
Grab him! Grab him!

51:36.982 --> 51:38.449
I can't hold him!

51:42.855 --> 51:44.054
Oh, my God!

51:45.389 --> 51:46.457
Oh, my God!

51:47.159 --> 51:48.392
Paul!

51:52.630 --> 51:54.097
Get out of the water!

51:54.099 --> 51:55.666
- Emily, go!
- Get to the bulkhead!

52:11.482 --> 52:16.019
<i>Calling CQ. Calling CQ.
This is Captain Lucien.</i>

52:16.021 --> 52:19.057
<i>We're at the Midway Station.
It's heavily damaged.</i>

52:21.126 --> 52:22.861
Not sure how long it will last.

52:25.163 --> 52:26.497
Does anyone copy?

52:28.466 --> 52:29.902
It ripped him out of the suit.

52:31.502 --> 52:33.638
It ripped him right out
of his goddamn suit.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.139
What could do that?

52:36.141 --> 52:37.640
<i>Begin evacuation</i>

52:37.642 --> 52:39.209
<i>to surface immediately.</i>

52:39.211 --> 52:40.578
CQ, do you copy?

52:42.347 --> 52:44.415
<i>Overwatch
tower is online.</i>

52:45.250 --> 52:46.517
What is happening?

52:51.890 --> 52:53.926
That drill weighs 6,000 tons.

52:55.928 --> 52:57.728
How did it get
ripped up like that?

53:00.232 --> 53:01.432
We did this.

53:04.369 --> 53:06.138
We drilled
the bottom of the ocean.

53:07.571 --> 53:09.074
We took too much.

53:10.375 --> 53:12.443
And now she's taking back.

53:17.515 --> 53:19.550
We're not supposed to be
down here.

53:22.220 --> 53:23.155
No one is.

53:26.158 --> 53:27.225
She's not wrong.

53:40.205 --> 53:41.073
Listen.

53:41.940 --> 53:43.574
I know Paul's gone, but...

53:45.710 --> 53:47.079
we can't stay here.

53:47.846 --> 53:49.547
What about Smith's suit?

53:50.681 --> 53:53.515
Let me take a look
at your oxygen scrubber.

53:53.517 --> 53:54.886
- Hmm.
- Come on.

54:03.795 --> 54:04.863
How is it?

54:09.034 --> 54:10.568
The suit's not gonna make it.

54:17.976 --> 54:19.744
You guys gotta
go without me. We... I'm...

54:20.979 --> 54:22.848
I'm just gonna be
dead weight out there.

54:27.052 --> 54:28.954
- I can't lose anybody else.
- Me neither.

54:30.355 --> 54:31.256
Stop.

54:37.429 --> 54:40.098
Okay,
Smith, you can lean on me.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.601
<i>Take short,
shallow breaths.</i>

54:44.403 --> 54:45.634
<i>Okay.</i>

54:45.636 --> 54:46.872
<i>It's gonna be all right.
I got you.</i>

55:29.680 --> 55:32.282
<i>Okay, there's Marker 21.</i>

55:32.284 --> 55:36.052
<i>All we do now is follow
these across the plateau.</i>

55:36.054 --> 55:38.156
<i>The Roebuck Station
will be at Marker Zero.</i>

56:04.416 --> 56:06.751
<i>What did you see? Huh?</i>

56:12.491 --> 56:13.325
<i>I don't know.</i>

56:25.070 --> 56:26.069
- I just saw it.
- Oh, my God!

56:26.071 --> 56:27.237
<i>I saw that.</i>

56:27.239 --> 56:27.971
<i>Set him down.</i>

56:27.973 --> 56:29.539
<i>What was that?</i>

56:29.541 --> 56:30.741
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

56:32.244 --> 56:33.912
<i>Where is it? Where is it?</i>

56:39.751 --> 56:40.819
<i>Turn off the lights.</i>

56:42.720 --> 56:43.755
<i>Don't move.</i>

56:48.692 --> 56:50.262
<i>I'm gonna turn my IR on.</i>

56:55.100 --> 56:56.801
<i>Norah, did you
get my feed?</i>

56:57.502 --> 56:58.436
Yeah.

57:17.355 --> 57:18.588
<i>Smith?</i>

57:18.590 --> 57:20.192
<i>Where's Smith? Norah?</i>

57:22.194 --> 57:23.293
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- Do you see him?

57:23.295 --> 57:24.460
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

57:24.462 --> 57:25.962
- <i>Smith!</i>
- <i>Emily.</i>

57:25.964 --> 57:27.463
- <i>Smith?</i>
- Smith!

57:27.465 --> 57:29.367
<i>Emily. Help.</i>

57:33.538 --> 57:34.839
- <i>That's his foot.</i>
- I'm going.

57:36.441 --> 57:37.842
<i>I'm hooking
onto you. Here.</i>

57:47.752 --> 57:48.787
<i>I see him.</i>

57:59.464 --> 58:00.265
<i>I got him.</i>

58:02.000 --> 58:04.169
<i>He's alive. He's alive.</i>

58:05.570 --> 58:06.838
<i>I'm pulling him back.</i>

58:09.307 --> 58:10.406
<i>Okay.</i>

58:10.408 --> 58:12.043
<i>Just push him.
We'll grab his feet.</i>

58:13.144 --> 58:15.578
<i>Smith, can you hear us?</i>

58:15.580 --> 58:17.146
Smith, please! Can you hear us?

58:17.148 --> 58:18.514
<i>I gotta grab the gun.</i>

58:18.516 --> 58:20.285
<i>What?
Forget the gun.</i>

58:21.820 --> 58:23.021
<i>Captain, leave it.</i>

58:27.626 --> 58:28.460
Cap.

58:34.933 --> 58:36.499
<i>Cap, what are you doing?</i>

58:36.501 --> 58:38.601
- <i>Norah!</i>
- No!

58:38.603 --> 58:41.371
<i>No!</i>

58:41.373 --> 58:42.374
<i>No!</i>

58:57.455 --> 58:58.454
<i>Norah?</i>

58:58.456 --> 58:59.357
<i>You okay?</i>

59:01.426 --> 59:03.426
<i>I can't see you.
Can you see me?</i>

59:06.031 --> 59:07.132
<i>Norah?</i>

59:10.235 --> 59:11.367
<i>Where are you?</i>

59:11.369 --> 59:14.037
I'm underneath you.
Can you see me?

59:14.039 --> 59:16.506
<i>Cap, can
you hear me?</i>

59:16.508 --> 59:17.342
<i>Norah.</i>

59:18.143 --> 59:19.110
<i>Where are you?</i>

59:20.912 --> 59:23.980
<i>I'm here.
Underneath.</i>

59:23.982 --> 59:27.183
<i>I'm all tangled.
Can you see me?</i>

59:27.185 --> 59:28.119
<i>Yeah.</i>

59:28.853 --> 59:30.055
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

59:36.027 --> 59:37.860
<i>Where is it?</i>

59:37.862 --> 59:39.395
<i>I don't know.</i>

59:39.397 --> 59:40.365
<i>Get me
out of here.</i>

59:44.135 --> 59:45.503
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Shit.

59:47.439 --> 59:49.040
<i>Okay, let me see
if I can help you. Hold on.</i>

59:51.242 --> 59:52.810
<i>Can you reach my knife?</i>

59:57.549 --> 59:58.350
<i>What was that?</i>

01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:10.862
<i>Norah.</i>

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:12.864
<i>Is it back?</i>

01:00:14.165 --> 01:00:15.266
<i>What do you see?</i>

01:00:16.668 --> 01:00:17.569
<i>Is it back?</i>

01:00:30.715 --> 01:00:31.583
<i>Norah!</i>

01:00:40.925 --> 01:00:42.160
<i>Norah!</i>

01:00:53.405 --> 01:00:55.905
<i>Oh, I got you. I got you.
I'm with you.</i>

01:00:55.907 --> 01:00:57.640
<i>I'm with you.</i>

01:00:57.642 --> 01:00:59.475
<i>Pressure level critical.</i>

01:00:59.477 --> 01:01:00.410
<i>We're
rising too fast!</i>

01:01:00.412 --> 01:01:02.111
<i>The pressure's gonna
kill us both!</i>

01:01:02.113 --> 01:01:04.215
<i>Please slow ascent.</i>

01:01:07.585 --> 01:01:08.420
<i>Norah.</i>

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:13.723
<i>Let go.</i>

01:01:13.725 --> 01:01:15.625
<i>Suit
integrity, ten percent.</i>

01:01:15.627 --> 01:01:16.628
<i>Norah,
look at me.</i>

01:01:18.096 --> 01:01:19.962
<i>Let go, God damn it!</i>

01:01:19.964 --> 01:01:22.198
No, I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.168
<i>Four percent.</i>

01:01:24.569 --> 01:01:26.202
<i>Three percent.</i>

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:27.336
<i>No, no, no. No, no, no.</i>

01:01:27.338 --> 01:01:28.371
<i>Two percent.</i>

01:01:28.373 --> 01:01:29.641
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

01:01:30.608 --> 01:01:31.441
<i>No, don't do that.</i>

01:01:31.443 --> 01:01:33.009
<i>One percent.</i>

01:01:33.011 --> 01:01:33.978
<i>Don't do that!
Don't do that!</i>

01:02:16.187 --> 01:02:17.222
<i>Emily, can
you hear me?</i>

01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:03.728
<i>Emily, Smith,
can you hear me?</i>

01:04:05.563 --> 01:04:08.499
<i>I'm still alive. I'm at
the old Shepard drill.</i>

01:04:10.335 --> 01:04:11.768
<i>There's no...</i>

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:14.303
<i>There's no pods here
but I can breathe.</i>

01:04:14.305 --> 01:04:15.538
<i>I have some air.</i>

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.674
<i>If you guys are
out there...</i>

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.578
<i>Is anyone reading?</i>

01:04:25.818 --> 01:04:26.819
Emily, can you hear me?

01:04:35.526 --> 01:04:36.628
Can you guys hear me?

01:05:05.124 --> 01:05:06.190
Cap.

01:05:30.949 --> 01:05:31.850
Allie.

01:05:39.657 --> 01:05:40.759
I'm sorry.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.465
<i>Guys, I'm just gonna
keep talking.</i>

01:07:29.467 --> 01:07:30.735
<i>I don't know if
you can hear me.</i>

01:07:37.976 --> 01:07:39.812
<i>I'm following
the southeast line.</i>

01:07:41.046 --> 01:07:42.380
<i>Following the markers.</i>

01:07:43.215 --> 01:07:44.382
<i>To the Roebuck.</i>

01:07:47.186 --> 01:07:48.921
<i>I used to love the ocean.</i>

01:07:54.059 --> 01:07:58.795
<i>It was like a giant
petri dish, you know?</i>

01:07:58.797 --> 01:07:59.965
<i>Em, is that you?</i>

01:08:14.712 --> 01:08:17.180
<i>I know that you have...</i>

01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:20.716
<i>a different Hawaiian shirt
for every day of the week.</i>

01:08:20.718 --> 01:08:22.718
Emily, I can hear you.
Is that you?

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.486
<i>Though I...</i>

01:08:24.488 --> 01:08:26.756
<i>Even though
I don't know you</i>

01:08:26.758 --> 01:08:28.591
<i>outside of this
petri dish...</i>

01:08:28.593 --> 01:08:29.759
<i>Emily.</i>

01:08:29.761 --> 01:08:32.764
But I know
that you listen to me.

01:08:34.365 --> 01:08:35.834
<i>And you make me laugh.</i>

01:08:47.545 --> 01:08:48.613
<i>I love you.</i>

01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:51.281
<i>You know?</i>

01:08:51.283 --> 01:08:52.383
<i>Em?</i>

01:08:55.053 --> 01:08:55.952
<i>Emily?</i>

01:08:55.953 --> 01:08:57.587
<i>I needed you to know.</i>

01:08:58.357 --> 01:08:59.157
<i>Emily?</i>

01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:02.359
<i>Hey.</i>

01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:04.361
<i>Emily, I'm right
behind you.</i>

01:09:04.363 --> 01:09:05.662
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.635
<i>Hey, Emily.</i>

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:14.069
- <i>Emily!</i>
- No! Please!

01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:15.604
<i>Please stay back!</i>

01:09:15.606 --> 01:09:17.240
<i>Emily, stop!</i>

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.848
<i>Emily. Hey, hey.</i>

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:27.483
<i>Hey. Em? Em? Em?
Open your eyes.</i>
