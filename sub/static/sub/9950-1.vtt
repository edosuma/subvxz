00:00.569 --> 00:04.264
Look at me, and look at the Queen.

00:04.401 --> 00:08.974
I wasn't a fan until it occurred
to me how much we have in common.

00:08.974 --> 00:11.533
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.609 --> 00:14.728
I know she's not a single parent,
but she might as well be.

00:14.795 --> 00:17.814
Plus, the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns -

00:17.909 --> 00:21.528
her literally sometimes -
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.538 --> 00:25.459
Admired and despised equally.
Not for never lifting a finger.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.978
No - for setting examples
through extremity.

00:28.979 --> 00:31.777
And whether you're a bigwig
on her end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.778 --> 00:34.817
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,

00:34.818 --> 00:36.777
snip, snip, snipping
at your benefits.

00:36.778 --> 00:38.977
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking

00:38.978 --> 00:40.699
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:40.700 --> 00:43.418
I got shot of my kids yonks back,

00:43.419 --> 00:46.457
whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.458 --> 00:49.699
Fine, I've had to get out of bed
on occasion to make ends meet,

00:49.700 --> 00:53.699
whereas she's done
the whole thing from a chair.

00:54.339 --> 00:55.977
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:55.978 --> 00:58.699
Oh, sure, there's perks,
but look at her lot -

00:58.700 --> 01:01.298
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:01.299 --> 01:04.178
Now, look at my lot -

01:04.179 --> 01:07.783
we know how to throw a proper
fucking party!

I don't listen any more.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.563
Yeah!

03:24.564 --> 03:27.964
Just like the Olympic Committee
didn't listen to Wilmslow

03:27.965 --> 03:31.564
and Bowdown and chose Chatsworth...

03:33.164 --> 03:35.883
yes, Chatsworth, to receive

Kids play on this street, Tel.

05:47.967 --> 05:51.045

05:53.327 --> 05:54.805
How's the big move going?

05:54.806 --> 05:56.725
I'm moving in with my big sister.

05:56.726 --> 05:59.205
Yeah, works wonders
for my self-esteem.

05:59.206 --> 06:01.885
Well, she's always thought
she's better than everyone else.

06:01.886 --> 06:04.927
Yeah, and a homeless, potless little
sister just perpetuates the myth.

06:04.928 --> 06:06.206
See ya later.

06:06.207 --> 06:07.644
Bye, love.

06:11.927 --> 06:15.125
Use your Old Spice!
That aftershave doesn't come cheap.

06:15.126 --> 06:17.567
The stronger aroma
caressing your nostrils

06:17.568 --> 06:21.567
is the sweet smell of success.

06:52.527 --> 06:53.805
Oh, Avril's moved out.

06:53.806 --> 06:57.045
Are you Frank, the bloke
who shifted Coggsy's furniture?

06:57.046 --> 07:00.047
And duly twinged
a hamstring in the process, yeah.

07:00.048 --> 07:01.366
Happy days.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.326
Fuck, you talking... hey.

07:03.327 --> 07:06.926
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm expecting someone.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.886
We know. Jizzabelle.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.607
Just diagnosed with a nasty dose.
Waiting on a prescription.

07:11.608 --> 07:14.684
Professional hazard,
but a lucky break for you.

07:15.607 --> 07:16.966
Lend us your phone.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.966
We always come as a pair.

07:18.967 --> 07:21.527
You ready for the night
of your life, Frank?

07:21.528 --> 07:24.886
What's up, Frank?

07:24.887 --> 07:28.006
Coggsy. Yeah, we need
to renegotiate, mate.

07:28.007 --> 07:30.246
I'll take the money instead.

07:30.247 --> 07:32.727
These two are bigger
than the fucking settees.

07:32.728 --> 07:35.686
Oi! Don't get personal,
Franky Wanky.

07:35.687 --> 07:39.286
Where's Jizzabelle?
I don't care if she's got AIDS.

07:39.287 --> 07:41.965
I'll get double bagged up and watch
her tamper with herself.

07:41.966 --> 07:43.365
I'd rather do a Rock Hudson

07:43.366 --> 07:45.447
than be trampled on
by these gastric bandits.

07:45.448 --> 07:46.726
Cheeky twat.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.207
What about the bird in the photo?

07:52.327 --> 07:53.766
Coggs...

07:53.767 --> 07:55.406
I'm Sherrilee.

07:55.407 --> 07:56.846
And I'm...

07:56.847 --> 07:58.326
Derrilee.

07:58.327 --> 08:00.447
And once you've been
spatchcocked by us...

08:00.448 --> 08:04.447
There ain't no looking back.

08:16.807 --> 08:18.086
Hiya! Hiya.

08:18.087 --> 08:20.366
Any feds come back?

08:20.367 --> 08:24.367
Don't you love smashing them up?

08:25.047 --> 08:27.286
Why so snide? Just a couple?

08:27.287 --> 08:30.047
The last thing your borderline
personality needs

08:30.048 --> 08:33.206
is a dose of this twisted shite.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.846
No-one else coming?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.806
It seems people have got
cautious in their old age.

08:38.807 --> 08:41.325
OK, then, I'm going to
be all right, go on.

08:41.326 --> 08:44.805
Mushroom virgin. I promised
I wouldn't let him go under.

08:44.806 --> 08:48.807
I'm a firm believer a trip a year
is a great work-out for the swede.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.887
About time you told me
who you've been shagging.

08:52.888 --> 08:54.846
Wide smile, sparkly eyes...

08:54.847 --> 08:57.287
She's right.
You can't fake that shit.

08:57.288 --> 09:00.286
Don't be stupid.

09:00.287 --> 09:04.046
This will open you up.

09:04.047 --> 09:06.007
No pain, no gain.

09:08.007 --> 09:09.526
I was there!

09:09.527 --> 09:13.166
My 21st? It was a madhouse.

09:13.167 --> 09:17.167
God, I was fucking fat!

09:18.047 --> 09:21.246
Hey, that was the night
Jamie was conceived.

09:21.247 --> 09:25.247
Paddy sneaked out of
the open nick for my birthday.

09:26.127 --> 09:30.127
Only shag in five months,
and I'm off me trolley on mushrooms.

09:32.207 --> 09:33.726
It wasn't just a shag.

09:33.727 --> 09:36.206
Are you getting at something?

09:36.207 --> 09:38.447
Oh, that image has
scarred me for years.

09:38.448 --> 09:39.926
What image?

09:39.927 --> 09:42.007
I thought the two of them
were attacking you.

09:42.008 --> 09:44.046
Tell me what you're on about.

09:44.047 --> 09:48.047
Paddy wasn't the only one
getting it on.

09:49.887 --> 09:53.887
Alfy the Arab? The medical student?

09:54.607 --> 09:56.646
Now I remember.

09:56.647 --> 09:58.846
Paddy was up the Gary Glitter.

09:58.847 --> 09:59.886
Wahey!

09:59.887 --> 10:01.365
Suppose someone had to.

10:01.366 --> 10:05.327
It wasn't his thing. Ever. The
mushrooms must've loosened him up.

10:05.328 --> 10:06.806
That's how I know.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.886
Your only shag in five months?

10:08.887 --> 10:12.887
The night Jamie was conceived?

10:15.887 --> 10:18.966
'But Alfy was up the front and...'

10:18.967 --> 10:22.967
'Paddy was up the Gary Glitter.'

10:24.687 --> 10:28.687
Frank's heard you've got mushrooms.

10:32.487 --> 10:34.450
Someone going to tell me
what's going on?

10:39.059 --> 10:43.259
Your mam can't look down her
nose at me anymore, the dirty bitch.

10:45.185 --> 10:47.423
You know how big she was back then.

10:47.424 --> 10:51.425
I suppose Mimi's sexual deviance
is the least of your worries.

10:51.585 --> 10:55.585
32 years happy with who you are.

11:02.152 --> 11:04.751
I'm happy.

11:04.752 --> 11:08.752
Connor's happy.

11:09.152 --> 11:12.791
You're still you.

11:12.792 --> 11:16.792
Still feel like a pound of semtex
has gone off in my head.

11:22.672 --> 11:24.832
Do I get the impression
you liked that, Frank?

11:24.833 --> 11:28.431
Oh, God!

11:28.432 --> 11:31.992
Eh, Derrilee, what the fuck
are you doing? Get over here!

11:31.993 --> 11:34.031
In a minute.

11:34.032 --> 11:36.952
There's no telling her, Frank.
It's a proper obsession.

11:36.975 --> 11:38.293
I have to clean.

11:38.294 --> 11:40.854
She goes through £30 a week
on bleach alone.

11:40.855 --> 11:44.253
Nobody even fucking lives here.

11:44.254 --> 11:47.334
You should have entertained us
round your gaff,

11:47.335 --> 11:51.334
she'd have left it sparkling.

12:03.654 --> 12:07.654
I think I could get used
to them mushrooms.

12:09.294 --> 12:11.333
Imagine Jamie's head today?

12:11.334 --> 12:15.133
Think it's any worse than Mimi's?

12:15.134 --> 12:17.172
Maybe Jamie hasn't said nothing.

12:17.248 --> 12:18.407
Well, why would he?

12:18.408 --> 12:21.369
And Dom and Gloria promised
it'd go no further.

12:23.649 --> 12:26.568
Seriously!

12:26.569 --> 12:30.569
Yeah, you can trust them.

12:33.929 --> 12:37.848
As you were.

12:37.849 --> 12:41.849
The dinner ladies want a price
on a thousand tins of tomatoes.

12:42.129 --> 12:46.129
I'll sort it.

12:48.129 --> 12:52.129
As you were!

12:52.929 --> 12:56.929
Can we have a talk in private?

12:58.729 --> 13:01.489
I'm the one with my dirty knickers
on display.

13:01.490 --> 13:05.489
And I'm another product of them
being dropped.

13:05.569 --> 13:07.648
This isn't easy for me.

13:07.649 --> 13:09.328
Piece of piss for me.

13:09.329 --> 13:10.608
Get over yourself.

13:10.609 --> 13:11.848
Just like that?

13:11.849 --> 13:13.369
Does it make that much difference?

13:13.370 --> 13:16.648
Difference is, I thought
I was a Maguire.

13:16.649 --> 13:17.929
I'm still your mother!

13:17.930 --> 13:19.448
More's the pity.

13:19.449 --> 13:20.689
She didn't remember.

13:20.690 --> 13:24.689
Exactly! How's this my fault?

13:25.209 --> 13:27.329
D'you know what, he wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for me!

13:27.330 --> 13:31.329
Code red!

13:32.649 --> 13:36.649
It's OK. Just nobody move.
Do not move.

13:36.889 --> 13:37.968
Put that down!

13:37.969 --> 13:40.088
This is not a drugs raid.

13:40.089 --> 13:41.968
So what's the charge then?

13:41.969 --> 13:43.447
Public disorder, affray.

13:43.448 --> 13:46.407
Affray? I've used more eggs
in an omelette.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.047
Come on,
where's your sense of humour?

13:48.048 --> 13:49.409
They were only messing about!

13:49.410 --> 13:52.208
Camera doesn't lie.

13:52.209 --> 13:54.288
I wasn't even there!

13:54.289 --> 13:55.328
And him.

13:55.329 --> 13:57.287
The camera's telling
porkies this time.

13:57.288 --> 13:58.769
Look, I swear, that's not even me.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.248
He was working here!

14:00.249 --> 14:03.488
12-6 all week.

14:03.489 --> 14:05.968
You know who was working!

14:05.969 --> 14:07.207
I was at the ceremony.

14:07.208 --> 14:09.809
Exactly. And that's why you'll be
joining us as well.

14:09.810 --> 14:11.248
Bollocks!

14:11.249 --> 14:12.968
And her.

14:12.969 --> 14:16.969
Oh, this is harassment!
Get off me, you fucking knobhead!

14:23.409 --> 14:26.569
Er, do you mind? I'm trying
to have a slash here.

14:26.570 --> 14:30.569
Very impressive, Shane Maguire.

14:30.689 --> 14:34.088
I can't see any rioters here,
can you?

14:34.089 --> 14:38.089
Stay put till we've gone.

14:41.169 --> 14:45.169
This is fucking ridiculous.
They've not even done anything.

14:45.529 --> 14:49.048
And we're still looking for these.

14:49.049 --> 14:53.049
It's a fucking joke!

14:56.689 --> 15:00.689
♪ Thank God for you
The wind beneath my wings. ♪

15:06.569 --> 15:10.569
Celine warbles the vowels just a tad
longer, gives the perfect yolk.

15:11.889 --> 15:14.249
Mum reckoned Bette Midler's
version was better.

15:14.250 --> 15:17.168
That's why her eggs were too runny.

15:17.169 --> 15:21.169
Such a relief having you in a safe
environment at last.

15:21.529 --> 15:25.529
Riots, junkies, gangsters...

15:25.809 --> 15:28.448
consider them things of the past.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.128
Get settled in a decent
neighbourhood.

15:31.129 --> 15:32.529
Chatsworth's all right.

15:32.530 --> 15:35.528
We never felt anything
but secure there.

15:35.529 --> 15:39.368
Maybe when Jackson was around.

15:39.369 --> 15:42.248
But all's well that ends well.

15:42.249 --> 15:46.168
Me and Mary Mae can look
after you now.

15:46.169 --> 15:47.529
Now for the fun part.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.328
Weekly costs...

15:50.329 --> 15:52.569
A hundred quid each
gets all-inclusive.

15:52.570 --> 15:55.168
Wifi's on, but Sky's extra...

15:55.169 --> 15:56.248
Shit!

15:56.249 --> 15:59.688
Anything you want to share?

15:59.689 --> 16:01.609
One of the kids has
gone off the rails.

16:01.610 --> 16:02.688
Kids?

16:02.689 --> 16:06.688
Yeah. We mentor underprivileged
immigrant families.

16:06.689 --> 16:10.689
Got to go. Always on call.

16:11.489 --> 16:15.489
Thank you.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.809
White kids got four years for
nicking Mars bars in the last riots.

16:19.810 --> 16:23.809
You've done nothing wrong.
Hold your head up.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.328
Excuse me.

16:27.329 --> 16:28.808
Hi.

16:28.809 --> 16:32.329
Erm, I just wanted to clear up
a little misunderstanding.

16:32.330 --> 16:36.329
See, my daughter
and I were moving house earlier...

16:42.489 --> 16:45.209
This is unbelievable.
We were moving house!

16:45.210 --> 16:47.008
With shopping trollies?

16:47.009 --> 16:48.248
Yeah.

16:48.249 --> 16:50.488
Hold your head up, Mum.

16:50.489 --> 16:51.608
Is your Dad in?

16:51.609 --> 16:53.849
I haven't seen him for a few weeks.
He works away.

16:53.850 --> 16:55.688
Can we have a look around?

16:55.689 --> 16:59.608
Not without my permission you can't.

16:59.609 --> 17:01.289
Thought you do everything together?

17:01.290 --> 17:05.167
'Sharston pole-dancing night
is her only night off.'

17:05.169 --> 17:07.646
'And you said you spent
all your money on the extra hours?'

17:07.647 --> 17:10.489
Well, you know, I was hoping
we could come to an arrangement.

17:10.490 --> 17:13.167
Business is business, Frank.

17:13.169 --> 17:16.009
I know. Yeah, but, you know,
given the laugh we had,

17:16.010 --> 17:20.009
you must have felt the connection.

17:21.648 --> 17:25.648
Credit me till next giro then!

17:27.209 --> 17:31.209
Coggsy, you got any settees
that need shifting?

17:31.489 --> 17:34.928
There's got to be something
I can do.

17:34.929 --> 17:38.929
So where the fuck am I going
to find 30 quid that...

17:48.289 --> 17:52.289
Won't find anything in there.

17:52.969 --> 17:54.529
Well done with the pigs, by the way.

17:54.530 --> 17:58.529
Piece of cake.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.208
Hey, any Bad Girls
lesbian fantasies?

18:15.209 --> 18:17.487
I let the desk sergeant
come on my glasses.

18:17.488 --> 18:20.129
Been a long time
since we were banged up together.

18:20.130 --> 18:23.248
Oh, what, like the good old days?

18:23.249 --> 18:25.408
Quiet, please.

18:25.409 --> 18:28.128
Be quiet!

18:28.129 --> 18:31.327
Maybe I shouldn't be surprised given
the lack of respect shown to the

18:31.328 --> 18:35.169
distinguished honour of being chosen
to host one of the Olympic rings.

18:35.170 --> 18:36.368
It was a zero!

18:36.369 --> 18:39.407
At least it appears you're saving
yourself from further embarrassment

18:39.408 --> 18:40.967
by all pleading guilty?

18:40.968 --> 18:42.969
Only because of bullshit pressure!

18:42.970 --> 18:44.168
Button it, Avril.

18:44.169 --> 18:46.447
You might have had your
first charge sheet at 17,

18:46.448 --> 18:48.887
but I had better hopes for her!
This is a disgrace!

18:48.888 --> 18:52.487
The fact you went equipped
with such ideal transportation

18:52.488 --> 18:54.567
would argue compellingly
against you.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.889
We were nowhere near!

18:55.890 --> 18:56.928
Mum!

18:56.929 --> 18:59.089
You're more than free to take
it further and gamble

18:59.090 --> 19:03.089
with the sentencing powers
of the Crown Court.

19:03.849 --> 19:06.688
Good.

19:06.689 --> 19:08.649
You'll be dealt with individually.

19:08.650 --> 19:11.448
Catherine Mimi Harmonica Joy Tutton.

19:11.449 --> 19:15.449
£500 and 100 hours
community service.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.128
£900 and 100 hours.

19:19.129 --> 19:20.648
150 hours.

19:20.649 --> 19:21.368
But...

19:21.369 --> 19:23.408
Looting.

19:23.409 --> 19:26.689
80 hours should give you time to
reflect on the damage you've caused

19:26.690 --> 19:28.808
to property and the community.

19:28.809 --> 19:32.809
Last, but not least, Lilian Tyler.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.449
Given your previous good character,

19:37.450 --> 19:41.449
I think binding over will be
sufficient in your case.

19:44.449 --> 19:48.449
Waahey! Free drinks for everyone who
suffered a miscarriage of justice!

19:58.289 --> 20:02.289
So the navvy is going to be at
the school? Jamie, our business.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.367
Have I got to take care
of everything, as usual?!

20:05.368 --> 20:08.807
I've just been in court again
because of this family.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.311
- What's that got do with anything?
- I'm not even a Maguire.

20:14.289 --> 20:16.047
Not having dad's potato-genes

20:16.048 --> 20:19.569
might explain why your accent's
all over the place, eh?

20:19.570 --> 20:23.569
Fucking hell, watch it,
Plastic Paddy!

20:25.969 --> 20:28.528
You really fancy this?

20:28.529 --> 20:31.408
Yeah, I do, mate. I feel it
in my blood.

20:31.409 --> 20:35.409
Telling ya, this field's the golden
goose that keeps on shitting eggs.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.328
We're going to smash it.

20:39.329 --> 20:42.408
Do you reckon Paddy knew?

20:42.409 --> 20:46.409
Why worry about him? Find your real
dad, that's more important, eh?

20:47.969 --> 20:50.928
Come on, how bad can it be?

20:50.929 --> 20:51.768
You reckon?

20:51.769 --> 20:55.769
I know.

20:56.249 --> 20:57.128
Sandwiches?

20:57.129 --> 20:59.768
Yeah.

20:59.769 --> 21:03.769
Has a bit of exercise got my little
bastard feeling any better?

21:04.289 --> 21:08.289
You're still convinced Connor
would like a granddad?

21:09.729 --> 21:11.568
Yeah. I adored mine.

21:11.569 --> 21:15.328
Someone to spoil him
even more than we do?

21:15.329 --> 21:18.408
Might spoil us as well.

21:18.409 --> 21:22.409
I think it's time to track him down.

21:24.889 --> 21:26.950
He lives in the poshest part
of Leeds.

21:35.217 --> 21:38.215
You need 30 quid and I
need to stay on the PTA.

21:38.216 --> 21:42.217
The kiddies know what to pick. You
bring the mushrooms straight to me.

21:43.097 --> 21:46.977
Nick any and your scrawny arse
will decompose in that field

21:46.978 --> 21:50.977
providing good nutrients
for next year's crop.

21:51.177 --> 21:54.055
And keep your beady eyes
on those lazy bastards

21:54.075 --> 21:55.596
rebuilding the shitters.

21:55.596 --> 21:58.594
First sign of skiving,
get on the blower.

21:58.595 --> 22:01.073
So do I get paid now
or at the end of the day?

22:01.074 --> 22:04.195
Public sector, Frank.
Monthly wages like everyone else.

22:04.196 --> 22:05.674
What good's that?!

22:05.675 --> 22:08.874
Sacrifice a giro in the
meantime?! No chance.

22:08.875 --> 22:11.115
It's less effort than signing on!

22:11.116 --> 22:14.514
Forms every week,
job plans, job club...

22:14.515 --> 22:18.515
it's full-time employment
keeping out of work these days.

22:18.915 --> 22:22.155
This job is tailor-made
for a lazy cunt like you.

22:22.156 --> 22:26.155
Part-time, own room,
going missing, phone,

22:27.075 --> 22:31.075
tidy a bit here, there,
sweep a few leaves. A doddle.

22:35.995 --> 22:37.994
Frank?

22:37.995 --> 22:39.554
Frank?

22:39.555 --> 22:42.314
What?

22:42.315 --> 22:45.515
You can tell there's
plenty of money round here.

22:45.516 --> 22:47.994
Will you calm down, you look fine.

22:47.995 --> 22:50.715
Are you sure you don't
want us to come in with you?

22:50.716 --> 22:53.914
No. Better break the news gently.

22:53.915 --> 22:57.915
How could he not love you?

23:12.555 --> 23:13.594
Where's Jamie?

23:13.595 --> 23:15.034
He rang in sick.

23:15.035 --> 23:17.033
So he finds Alfy, what's the point?

23:17.034 --> 23:19.275
Why does he think
that's going to help?

23:19.276 --> 23:23.275
Exactly. Driving himself
mad for nothing.

23:24.395 --> 23:25.835
I thought you got off?

23:25.836 --> 23:28.154
I did.

23:28.155 --> 23:30.955
And I heard those Arabs,
they don't age well.

23:30.956 --> 23:33.154
Exactly.

23:33.155 --> 23:37.155
Although he does sound like
a better option than Paddy.

23:38.075 --> 23:39.473
Paddy wasn't all bad.

23:39.474 --> 23:41.355
Suppose he couldn't have been.

23:41.356 --> 23:42.954
Meaning?

23:42.955 --> 23:46.794
Well, I never get shit dick, do I?

23:46.795 --> 23:48.714
Oh, here we go again!

23:48.715 --> 23:51.354
"Up the greaser, yak yak yak!"

23:51.355 --> 23:54.035
I have no idea what
my dad's up to now.

23:54.036 --> 23:58.035
I've not even got one any more.

24:02.475 --> 24:05.395
Pick up Gallagher, you lazy tramp!

24:08.715 --> 24:09.794
Hello.

24:09.795 --> 24:10.874
Frank!

24:10.875 --> 24:12.994
Ah, Mama Mimi most mild!

24:12.995 --> 24:15.393
Cut the wisecracks,
scruffy bollocks.

24:15.394 --> 24:16.995
How's the kiddie-shitters looking?

24:16.996 --> 24:20.995
Er, hang on.

24:27.195 --> 24:29.234
They haven't even turned up?

24:29.235 --> 24:33.235
I fucking knew it!

24:45.715 --> 24:49.075
This is for the community, right?
"Community Service."

24:49.076 --> 24:50.194
Yeah.

24:50.195 --> 24:53.195
Have you got any say
in how we serve our time?

24:53.196 --> 24:54.594
Yeah.

24:54.595 --> 24:58.113
Well, we're not talking the Sudan,
or some other potless gaff.

24:58.114 --> 25:00.193
Less than a mile away from here,

25:00.194 --> 25:03.193
English kiddies are risking
illness and disease

25:03.194 --> 25:05.633
by holding in their urine
and their faeces

25:05.634 --> 25:08.433
because they haven't
got functioning toilets.

25:08.434 --> 25:12.435
That or they march to Mapley Park
and risk noncing by paedos.

25:13.355 --> 25:15.794
Half term starts today.

25:15.795 --> 25:17.475
Imagine the joy on their faces

25:17.476 --> 25:21.475
if they got back to find
they could piss in safety.

25:24.115 --> 25:25.954
Karen!

25:25.955 --> 25:29.955
Right then, shall we
go and see Granddad?

25:32.715 --> 25:34.314
Kassi, Karen.

25:34.315 --> 25:37.474
- Hiya.
- Hello. Welcome, come in.

25:37.475 --> 25:40.834
This is Connor.
Say hello to your new uncle.

25:40.835 --> 25:42.234
Hello. Hello!

25:42.235 --> 25:43.755
Connor's got three new cousins.

25:43.756 --> 25:44.914
Wow.

25:44.915 --> 25:46.115
No granddad, I'm afraid.

25:46.116 --> 25:46.794
Oh?

25:46.795 --> 25:50.634
Dad died when I turned 16.
Jamie will fill you in.

25:50.635 --> 25:52.035
Can he use the toilet?

25:52.036 --> 25:54.074
Yes, of course.

25:54.075 --> 25:56.674
Go on.

25:56.675 --> 25:57.954
Tea, coffee?

25:57.955 --> 26:01.955
Coffee'd be great.

26:03.715 --> 26:06.075
Looks like he inherited
a few quid, though?

26:06.076 --> 26:08.474
Fuck all.

26:08.475 --> 26:11.035
Alfy the Arab died potless.
He wasn't a doctor.

26:11.036 --> 26:12.154
Oh.

26:12.155 --> 26:16.155
Dropped out after his first year.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.554
Well, are you OK with that?

26:18.555 --> 26:20.274
I am.

26:20.275 --> 26:24.074
It's a shame for Connor.

26:24.075 --> 26:26.794
There any more?

26:26.795 --> 26:28.154
How old is he?

26:28.155 --> 26:29.954
30.

26:29.955 --> 26:31.955
He's done all right for himself.

26:31.956 --> 26:35.955
Are you done? Come on, then.

26:40.315 --> 26:43.114
Where in Liverpool is the pub?

26:43.115 --> 26:45.994
It's not. It's Manchester.

26:45.995 --> 26:49.995
Of course. Sorry. Struggling
getting my head around all this.

26:50.515 --> 26:52.435
Jamie's mum is from Liverpool.

26:52.436 --> 26:55.034
Ah. And she was at college with Dad?

26:55.035 --> 26:59.034
She worked in the chip shop.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.434
What does she do now?

27:01.435 --> 27:05.435
She's big in the local PTA.

27:06.515 --> 27:10.475
There.

27:13.755 --> 27:15.035
Who's that with them?

27:15.036 --> 27:16.314
Paddy.

27:16.315 --> 27:20.315
Who you thought was your dad?

27:23.795 --> 27:27.795
She's not his normal type.

27:31.115 --> 27:34.034
How long were they together?

27:34.035 --> 27:35.833
It was a bit of a one-night stand.

27:35.834 --> 27:37.593
They knew each other
a while, though.

27:37.594 --> 27:39.715
Apparently they were
the worse for wear.

27:39.716 --> 27:42.514
No, that excuse doesn't wash.

27:42.515 --> 27:46.515
He needs an excuse?

27:46.595 --> 27:49.195
Not for the one-night stand.
He never drank.

27:49.196 --> 27:50.874
Yeah?

27:50.875 --> 27:52.995
Try off his rocker on mushrooms.

27:52.996 --> 27:56.995
No! No chance.

27:58.115 --> 28:00.594
They had a threesome.

28:00.595 --> 28:04.595
Your old fella hanging
out of the front.

28:04.675 --> 28:08.675
Our old man.

28:09.355 --> 28:12.314
Listen, we've got a lot on.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.353
Well, Esther will be back
with the kids in a minute.

28:15.354 --> 28:17.579
- Let Connor meet his cousins?
- Another time, yeah?

28:23.355 --> 28:27.355
Should've knocked
that little prick out.

28:39.755 --> 28:41.274
Hang on a sec.

28:41.275 --> 28:43.954
Oi, nonces!

28:43.955 --> 28:46.954
The entertainment starts at seven!

28:46.955 --> 28:50.955
You can come back then
and fucking pay at the gate!

28:53.395 --> 28:56.275
I'll give you a bell back later,
yeah? All right, mate.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.674
Look, you didn't see that.

29:04.675 --> 29:06.954
Plenty here I "haven't seen."

29:06.955 --> 29:10.475
And I'm prepared not to,
as long as you keep them enclosed.

29:10.476 --> 29:14.475
You make this work,
good luck to you.

29:15.595 --> 29:19.595
Er? Warrant?!

29:32.235 --> 29:36.114
Nice office. Moving in?

29:36.115 --> 29:39.275
Living on site's good
enough for Michael Eavis.

29:39.276 --> 29:43.275
Just so you know,
I could never be a grass.

29:44.835 --> 29:46.115
Where's that come from?

29:46.116 --> 29:50.115
Why else are you giving me,
the, er, special treatment?

30:09.555 --> 30:13.234
Seems your mum was a bit
lively in her prime.

30:13.235 --> 30:16.674
Wayward youth, y'know. Scousers.

30:16.675 --> 30:20.114
I like it.

30:20.115 --> 30:24.115
Multiple entries.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.914
'All units, all units.

30:26.915 --> 30:30.915
'Reports of a missing five-year-old
girl in the Byley Boulevard area.'

30:32.915 --> 30:35.554
Are you going to read me my rights?

30:35.555 --> 30:39.555
Nothing interferes
with a missing kiddie.

30:48.995 --> 30:52.674
The police are after you.

30:52.675 --> 30:56.675
Fuck 'em!

30:58.515 --> 31:02.114
Pointless trying to
puncture my happiness, Lillian.

31:02.115 --> 31:05.715
My defences are reinforced
so the full force of the law

31:05.716 --> 31:08.754
can crash down and
be rebuffed at will.

31:08.755 --> 31:11.714
Tonight, I am truly alive!

31:11.715 --> 31:14.555
Ah-ah-ah! Only our drinks
on the premises, Frank.

31:14.556 --> 31:18.154
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
20 diddley dees, my good man.

31:18.155 --> 31:20.313
Not the disco-biscuit dancey things,

31:20.314 --> 31:23.473
them hardcore filthy ones
spiked with a pinch of Viagra.

31:23.474 --> 31:25.075
All the drugs got
flirted in the raid.

31:25.076 --> 31:28.834
No one's got access
till Jamie gets back.

31:28.835 --> 31:31.634
Ah! Mine host of the chemicals.

31:31.635 --> 31:32.994
Alfy not with you?

31:32.995 --> 31:35.393
If you fancy another threesome
you better get a shovel

31:35.394 --> 31:37.995
cos he's six foot under
in Roundhay cemetery.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.474
Boosh!

31:40.475 --> 31:41.474
How was it?

31:41.475 --> 31:43.075
Well, he's got a new brother.

31:43.076 --> 31:45.234
Fuck off! You serious?

31:45.235 --> 31:47.274
Cool as me?

31:47.275 --> 31:48.274
Thought so.

31:48.275 --> 31:52.034
At last! The world mourns
another poor, dead Arab.

31:52.035 --> 31:56.035
Jamie! What are you
playing at, mate? Produce-request.

31:56.075 --> 31:58.033
And all this bullshit's done with,

31:58.034 --> 32:01.393
no more running around playing
"Who do you think y'are?"

32:01.394 --> 32:03.393
While you've been
fucking about in Leeds

32:03.394 --> 32:05.273
I've been busy
picking up the pieces.

32:05.274 --> 32:09.275
Jamie. Pill-me-up with the
stepping stones to celestial bliss.

32:10.115 --> 32:14.115
20 of your finest serotonin
fucker-uppers. The dirty ones.

32:20.515 --> 32:23.074
He-ey! I love it here, me.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.835
That's good to know, Frank.

32:24.836 --> 32:28.835
You've always been
like a son to me.

32:29.875 --> 32:33.875
Don't wait up, anyone.

32:36.755 --> 32:40.715
I've sorted another crew.
Silver lining of community service.

32:40.716 --> 32:42.874
I'm not interested.

32:42.875 --> 32:46.154
Come on Jamie,
this is getting boring.

32:46.155 --> 32:47.834
I'm out.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.715
What does that mean? Out of what?

32:49.716 --> 32:52.514
The lot.

32:52.515 --> 32:54.509
Congratulations on
your promotion, mate.

33:06.606 --> 33:09.246
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

33:09.320 --> 33:13.319
Why's it so difficult to understand?
It's over.

33:14.479 --> 33:18.479
Mickey, definitely. Shane, maybe.
I never thought I'd see the day

33:18.919 --> 33:21.237
where I had to tell you
to get a grip.

33:21.238 --> 33:23.439
Not one little
doubt in 32 years?

33:23.804 --> 33:25.562
Jamie, please believe me.

33:25.563 --> 33:27.901
I know you must have known
it wasn't Paddy.

33:27.993 --> 33:28.794
I swear I didn't!

33:29.074 --> 33:30.152
Bollocks!

33:30.153 --> 33:34.153
Oh, so I'm a liar as well?

33:42.153 --> 33:46.032
It's every kid's instinct
to prove himself to his dad.

33:46.033 --> 33:49.312
And you did.

33:49.313 --> 33:53.152
You did him proud.

33:53.153 --> 33:54.711
But it was the wrong man!

33:54.712 --> 33:56.831
Why does it matter?
He's the one who brought you up.

33:56.832 --> 33:59.713
So losing ten years of your life
wouldn't matter to you?

33:59.714 --> 34:02.912
Stuck in jail, based on a lie.

34:02.913 --> 34:06.152
All to show my "dad"
what I was made of.

34:06.153 --> 34:09.913
That's wasted time me and her
could have spent together.

34:09.914 --> 34:13.512
Bigger family, better house,
proper neighbourhood.

34:13.513 --> 34:15.913
You always talk
about getting away.

34:15.914 --> 34:19.913
By the sea. Devon, Cornwall?
Well, maybe it's time.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.512
Don't say that.

34:23.513 --> 34:26.152
I've always fancied Australia.

34:26.152 --> 34:28.792
Or New Zealand.

34:28.793 --> 34:31.351
Australia, New Zealand. Visas?

34:31.353 --> 34:35.353
Manslaughter convictions don't
grant instant access any more.

34:36.553 --> 34:38.312
Well, anywhere then.

34:38.313 --> 34:41.391
A proper break.

34:41.393 --> 34:45.393
Give Connor a proper
start in life that we never had.

34:50.632 --> 34:53.312
Mum, we're late.

34:53.313 --> 34:57.313
Tell me again
how this mentoring works.

35:10.473 --> 35:14.473
Wakey-wakey!

35:15.633 --> 35:18.752
Uh! Uh!

35:18.753 --> 35:22.351
A more civilised manner
in which to greet the sunrise

35:22.352 --> 35:23.831
I have yet to imagine.

35:23.832 --> 35:26.073
This is way over our rate, Frank.

35:26.074 --> 35:27.392
Even for all night.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.872
Well, enlighten me like that again,

35:29.873 --> 35:33.873
and you'll be swimming in enough
bleach to sanitise Old Trafford.

35:34.393 --> 35:35.632
I'd love your job.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.993
We've got a real gent here, Sher.

35:41.713 --> 35:44.713
Hey, hey!

35:47.193 --> 35:51.193
Now do that with your mouth!

35:55.473 --> 35:57.071
I need to get a fucking door.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.793
Brought you these -
books for the business. Eh?

35:59.794 --> 36:03.192
Well, the official ones anyway.

36:03.193 --> 36:05.911
Come on, you're not
serious about this, are you?

36:05.912 --> 36:09.913
I'm out. Fuck the business and fuck
Mam. Fuck the Chatsworth.

36:10.753 --> 36:12.192
And me?

36:12.193 --> 36:13.551
Yeah, fuck you an' all.

36:13.552 --> 36:15.113
I'm not gonna step up, you know.

36:15.114 --> 36:17.312
Got this place now, haven't I?

36:17.313 --> 36:19.032
Big plans.

36:19.033 --> 36:20.112
Nah.

36:20.113 --> 36:24.113
Your departure heralds
the end of an empire.

36:24.193 --> 36:25.672
Maybe Mam'll do it.

36:25.673 --> 36:27.752
You reckon?

36:27.753 --> 36:31.713
I'm not saying she doesn't love
the whole Mimi Big-bollocks routine

36:31.714 --> 36:35.472
but it's not the only reason
she does it, you know?

36:35.473 --> 36:39.032
Yeah, it is.

36:39.033 --> 36:41.712
Nah. It's tribal for her.

36:41.713 --> 36:45.713
No tribe, no point.

36:45.833 --> 36:48.552
No you...

36:48.553 --> 36:49.832
no point.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.633
So she does this all for me,
does she?

36:51.634 --> 36:55.633
You do it for each other.

36:55.873 --> 36:59.072
You'll miss me.

36:59.073 --> 37:03.073
But you'll miss her more.

37:19.513 --> 37:23.512
Now this is what I call
value for money.

37:23.513 --> 37:26.471
We empty the bank accounts
and safety boxes,

37:26.472 --> 37:30.473
sell the car and furniture,
we cash in our stake in the Jockey,

37:30.593 --> 37:34.593
and we can afford this.

37:34.633 --> 37:37.991
Five acres overlooking the ocean,
and we won't have to work

37:37.992 --> 37:40.513
for the next three years
if we don't want to.

37:40.514 --> 37:41.792
Where is it?

37:41.793 --> 37:43.072
Nugget Bay.

37:43.073 --> 37:44.792
Very funny!

37:44.793 --> 37:47.711
It is! Look, you follow the coast
all the way down

37:47.712 --> 37:50.073
from Christchurch
to near the bottom.

37:50.074 --> 37:51.352
Christchurch?

37:51.353 --> 37:53.592
New Zealand?

37:53.593 --> 37:57.593
Which is what I always said.

37:58.633 --> 38:01.392
Go on.

38:01.393 --> 38:05.072
I will follow you to
the end of the earth.

38:05.073 --> 38:09.073
I love you, no matter who you are,
or what you are.

38:09.433 --> 38:12.912
You, me and Connor
is all that counts.

38:12.913 --> 38:15.992
No matter where we are.

38:15.993 --> 38:17.952
I mean, watching United

38:17.953 --> 38:21.113
at three o'clock in the morning's
gonna be a pain in the arse,

38:21.114 --> 38:23.832
but other than that,

38:23.833 --> 38:27.833
it's all perfect.

38:31.033 --> 38:35.033
Except I know you don't
want to go.

38:43.193 --> 38:47.193
It's only right, you know.
Offenders putting a bit back.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.391
Guess who couldn't keep away?

39:14.392 --> 39:17.993
Thought I'd bring you
something nutritious for lunch,

39:17.994 --> 39:19.512
keep your strength up.

39:19.513 --> 39:20.513
Course you did.

39:20.514 --> 39:23.032
Consider this an education, Mary Mae.

39:23.033 --> 39:25.113
Be grateful that this
is probably the only time

39:25.114 --> 39:27.952
you'll encounter
this level of society.

39:27.953 --> 39:29.352
Cheeky bitch.

39:29.353 --> 39:33.353
You are so much better than this.

39:52.793 --> 39:56.152
Sandwich spread and cheese slices?

39:56.153 --> 40:00.153
How old am I?

40:04.193 --> 40:08.193
All this work, earning readies.

40:08.593 --> 40:12.593
None of it matters without you.

40:19.273 --> 40:23.273
Used to be that and a Mars Bar
every Tuesday and Thursday.

40:25.273 --> 40:27.872
Remember any others?

40:27.873 --> 40:31.873
Beef and tomato paste and cucumber,
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

40:34.033 --> 40:36.872
What chocolate bar?

40:36.873 --> 40:40.873
Kit Kat or a Bounty.

40:45.353 --> 40:48.832
Been playing it over and over.

40:48.833 --> 40:52.833
Guess the warning signs
were always there.

40:53.433 --> 40:57.112
There was always something
different about you,

40:57.113 --> 41:01.113
something more going on.
Something better.

41:08.433 --> 41:11.232
Maybe I did know, subconsciously.

41:11.233 --> 41:13.432
Just couldn't admit it.

41:13.433 --> 41:17.433
Terrified what it would mean for me
and Paddy.

41:23.193 --> 41:27.193
I am sorry.

41:29.633 --> 41:33.633
I know.

41:40.713 --> 41:44.713
I will have that sandwich.

41:54.033 --> 41:56.192
That's how good I am.

41:56.193 --> 41:57.872
That's how easy

41:57.873 --> 42:00.872
I can sneak up.

42:00.873 --> 42:04.113
Which is what I'll do if you breathe
a word of this to anyone.

42:04.114 --> 42:06.552
What do you want?

42:06.553 --> 42:10.553
Twisted, filthy, full-on fucking
and beasting.

42:12.073 --> 42:13.672
No strings.

42:13.673 --> 42:17.673
No questions.

42:21.033 --> 42:25.033
I'm addictive.

42:26.233 --> 42:28.912
I'll blow your mind.

42:28.913 --> 42:32.913
And if I'm remotely impressed,
it might happen again.

42:36.193 --> 42:38.832
Show me what you've got, Mr Villain.

42:38.833 --> 42:40.232
Grrr!

42:40.233 --> 42:44.233
There you go, sweet cheeks.
There you go, smiler.

42:44.313 --> 42:46.232
There you go, Lillian.

42:46.233 --> 42:49.512
There you go, lazy arse.

42:49.513 --> 42:51.992
Plenty more where that came from.

42:51.993 --> 42:54.753
The Maguire money-machine
keeps on rolling.

42:54.754 --> 42:56.392
And the school's sorted.

42:56.393 --> 43:00.393
And looks like Lucky Bollocks
here finally gets it right.

43:01.513 --> 43:04.033
I can't work out how you
never got nicked.

43:04.034 --> 43:06.712
Born lucky.

43:06.713 --> 43:09.113
You should start
doing my lottery tickets.

43:09.114 --> 43:12.072
Oh, bloody hell. Downturn Abby.

43:12.073 --> 43:16.073
Her name is Patty.

43:17.273 --> 43:18.672
We're honoured.

43:18.673 --> 43:22.471
I thought it'd be nice to spend
some quality time with my sister.

43:22.472 --> 43:25.753
If you want to join us down at "that
level of society", that's fine.

43:25.754 --> 43:28.992
But, I think you
owe my friends an apology.

43:28.993 --> 43:32.992
Come on, Avril. There's no smoke
without fire.

43:32.993 --> 43:35.313
They were all there.
And there was a riot.

43:35.314 --> 43:38.632
An apology.

43:38.633 --> 43:42.272
I'm sorry.

43:42.273 --> 43:44.152
Mine's a G&T, babes.

43:44.153 --> 43:45.312
Kassi!

43:45.313 --> 43:46.593
What's the occasion?

43:46.594 --> 43:50.593
It's a private celebration.

43:52.153 --> 43:54.831
Thought it was my turn
to make the effort.

43:54.832 --> 43:58.671
Check out Manchester, me and you
get to know each other...

43:58.672 --> 44:02.191
I wanted to find my dad.
Leeds wasn't about me and you.

44:02.192 --> 44:04.913
It's a good opportunity
to explore that?

44:04.914 --> 44:07.192
Not really, no.

44:07.193 --> 44:10.431
We might find we have
more in common than you think.

44:10.432 --> 44:12.353
And I always wanted a brother.

44:12.354 --> 44:15.152
He's got me, hasn't he?

44:15.153 --> 44:16.872
I'm Kassi.

44:16.873 --> 44:20.873
It's time you should leave.

44:21.393 --> 44:24.352
You not listening? Fuck off!

44:24.353 --> 44:28.353
Maybe come another time, Kas.

44:28.793 --> 44:30.512
Come on, mate.

44:30.513 --> 44:32.031
Dickhead! You still here?

44:32.032 --> 44:33.033
What's the problem?

44:33.034 --> 44:34.512
You are!

44:34.513 --> 44:36.993
Fuck's sake, Jamie!
He's your brother!

44:36.994 --> 44:39.912
Get him fucking out of here!

44:39.913 --> 44:43.913
Shane, throw him out the back.

44:45.393 --> 44:49.312
Chatsworth. The Maguires.

44:49.313 --> 44:52.431
What if I'm meant to
be part of another kingdom?

44:52.432 --> 44:54.231
I loved the Jungle Book
when I was a kid.

44:54.232 --> 44:57.553
But I always got upset when Mowgli
realised he wasn't a wolf.

44:57.554 --> 45:00.672
It wasn't his fault
he'd been conned.

45:00.673 --> 45:03.271
He still loved the wolves
and Big Baloo

45:03.272 --> 45:05.871
but he could never forget
he was different.

45:05.872 --> 45:09.071
Couldn't help wondering
if there were more like him.

45:09.072 --> 45:11.151
Mowgli knew he had to go
to the village

45:11.152 --> 45:13.111
and see what it was all about.

45:13.112 --> 45:15.951
So he went to
find his place in the world.

45:15.952 --> 45:19.351
'Hey, this is Kassi, I can't
take your call right now

45:19.352 --> 45:23.353
'so please leave a message and
I'll get back to you when I can.'

45:23.354 --> 45:26.592
The good things happened.

45:26.593 --> 45:29.952
Right?

45:29.953 --> 45:31.311
Better watch your tone.

45:31.312 --> 45:33.833
You better watch out you don't
overstep the mark.

45:33.834 --> 45:37.833
Go in, after midnight,
rip it out, sell it on.

45:37.873 --> 45:39.352
They know about this?

45:39.353 --> 45:40.632
Frank, I'm stuck!

45:40.633 --> 45:43.153
I'll catch you, trust me!

45:44.033 --> 45:46.951
- You get on all right, as a family?
- I thought she was lovely.

45:46.952 --> 45:49.951
- Second time this week
we've almost been caught.
- I want to do normal things.

45:49.952 --> 45:52.513
Why don't we, then?
Tonight, Grand Hotel.

45:52.514 --> 45:54.538
Oh, shite!

45:55.898 --> 46:36.243

46:36.243 --> 46:38.442
Here, tell him what your Biddy said.

46:38.443 --> 46:39.804
That I left hair in the bath!

46:39.805 --> 46:41.643
Oh, ride it, baby!

46:41.644 --> 46:43.523
Hair, as if!

46:43.524 --> 46:44.843
Yeah, let it go.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.004
I know how good I cleaned it.

46:46.005 --> 46:47.083
It sparkles!

46:47.084 --> 46:48.323
I love to clean.

46:48.324 --> 46:49.643
Ride it out!

46:49.644 --> 46:52.494
Give it to the big boy.
