WEBVTT

00:04.150 --> 00:06.992
As our Hood Legends tour continues,

00:06.994 --> 00:10.274
what you're witnessing here is
what we here in Brooklyn call

00:10.276 --> 00:12.559
a "shoe drop", okay?

00:12.561 --> 00:15.121
This line right here could extend
all the way to Manhattan,

00:15.123 --> 00:17.366
across the bridge,
depending on the hype.

00:17.368 --> 00:19.408
Yo, shorty, what shoes you waitin' on?

00:19.410 --> 00:20.650
The new Jordans.

00:20.652 --> 00:22.252
You remind me of me, man.

00:22.254 --> 00:24.438
I remember my first pair of Jordans.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.824
- It's a magical day in the hood
- _

00:26.826 --> 00:29.260
when a boy gets his first
pair of new Jordans.

00:29.262 --> 00:31.046
It represents them not having to wear

00:31.048 --> 00:32.567
duh-dunt-duh-dunt's no more...

00:32.570 --> 00:34.570
you know, hand-me-downs,

00:34.572 --> 00:35.995
knock-offs.

00:35.997 --> 00:37.734
Adidas with seven stripes,

00:37.736 --> 00:39.817
Chuck Taylors with the heels,

00:39.819 --> 00:42.741
Pumas with domesticated
house cats on 'em.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.303
It's the first time in your life

00:44.305 --> 00:46.146
when you get to feel rich.

00:46.148 --> 00:48.549
You feel like you're walking on air,

00:48.551 --> 00:51.353
like one of those trolley
shots in a Spike Lee joint.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.235
I was a superstar.

00:53.237 --> 00:56.279
Guys wanted to be me,
girls wanted to see me,

00:56.281 --> 00:58.325
but haters always gonna hate.

00:58.327 --> 01:00.270
That's the day I met the hood legend

01:00.272 --> 01:01.435
"Kangaroo Jack".

01:02.701 --> 01:04.782
Run 'em. Put 'em in the pouch.

01:04.784 --> 01:06.641
Kangaroo Jack was the "Michael Jordan

01:06.643 --> 01:07.986
of stealing Jordans".

01:07.988 --> 01:09.988
He got his name because
his getaway skills

01:09.990 --> 01:11.831
was legendary.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.794
Legend has it that, to this day,

01:13.796 --> 01:15.916
Kangaroo Jack has never been caught

01:15.918 --> 01:17.799
and still roams these Brooklyn streets.

01:20.484 --> 01:22.846
So, kids,

01:22.848 --> 01:25.249
if you ever get a fresh
pair of new Jordans,

01:25.251 --> 01:26.971
you better keep your eyes open,

01:26.973 --> 01:29.592
or you'll get jacked...
by Kangaroo Jack.

01:40.671 --> 01:42.752
Thank you all for joining me today.

01:42.754 --> 01:46.357
Remember, there's a hood legend
in each and every one of y'all.

01:48.361 --> 01:50.522
You know what? Cronuts
is the only good thing

01:50.524 --> 01:52.074
to come out of gentrification.

01:52.076 --> 01:53.179
How we do?

01:53.181 --> 01:54.764
The livestream of the tour went well.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.091
You're averaging 50 more
viewers than last week.

01:57.093 --> 01:58.653
10 new people just followed you,

01:58.655 --> 02:00.415
and your engagement is up 3%.

02:00.417 --> 02:02.018
How much dollars is that?

02:02.020 --> 02:03.379
Zero.

02:03.381 --> 02:06.704
But you can't put a price on Insta fame.

02:06.706 --> 02:08.545
You know something?

02:08.548 --> 02:10.794
I had the original release
of those back in the day.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.700
You still had them
today in mint condition,

02:12.702 --> 02:14.795
they'd be worth $25,000.

02:14.797 --> 02:16.641
What?! $25,000?!

02:16.643 --> 02:19.200
Man, you know what I could
do with that kind of money?

02:19.202 --> 02:21.323
And I think might still have them.

02:21.325 --> 02:22.938
Well, I hope they're hermetically sealed

02:22.940 --> 02:24.487
in a temperature-controlled environment.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.690
I gotta get to Shay, man.
She might know where they at.

02:26.692 --> 02:28.653
- Come on, Miles. Let's go.
- Mnm.

02:28.655 --> 02:30.856
I've hit my quota of social interaction.

02:30.858 --> 02:32.738
- Need to recharge.
- No, no, no.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.661
You said we were gonna
spend the day together.

02:34.663 --> 02:37.865
Plus, I still need your car. Let's go!

02:37.867 --> 02:41.470
Shay, I just want you to know
things are gonna change, okay?

02:41.472 --> 02:42.832
I'm getting out the game.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.302
Then me and you gonna focus on making

02:44.304 --> 02:46.717
our dreams come true, I promise.

02:51.325 --> 02:53.766
- Baby, are these all my sketches?
- Yes, it is.

02:53.768 --> 02:56.530
This is what you want to do,
we gonna make it happen.

02:56.532 --> 02:58.332
Oh, baby, this means so much to me.

02:58.334 --> 02:59.774
And you mean so much to me.

02:59.776 --> 03:01.777
Happy anniversary.

03:01.779 --> 03:03.099
Mwah!

03:03.101 --> 03:04.701
- I got something for you, too.
- Wh-What?

03:04.703 --> 03:06.343
Shay, come on. What did you do.

03:06.345 --> 03:07.705
Open it! Open it.

03:07.707 --> 03:09.307
- Aw, man.
- Open it.

03:09.309 --> 03:11.029
Aah!

03:11.031 --> 03:13.192
I'm goin' all out.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.995
A fresh pair of new Jordans

03:14.997 --> 03:16.684
for our fresh new life together.

03:16.686 --> 03:17.919
- Thank you.
- I hope you like them.

03:17.921 --> 03:20.000
- I love 'em!
- Try 'em on.

03:20.002 --> 03:22.324
Wait a minute. My phone is ringing.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.610
It's Wavy.

03:26.612 --> 03:29.344
This is the last one. I gotta do this.

03:29.346 --> 03:30.513
I'll be right back.

03:30.515 --> 03:32.138
But, I never got to those Jordans.

03:32.140 --> 03:34.825
'Cause the next night, I got locked up.

03:34.827 --> 03:36.730
What is wrong with you,

03:36.732 --> 03:38.626
banging on my door like
that and just coming in?

03:38.628 --> 03:39.691
And who is this?

03:39.693 --> 03:41.991
Shay, this is my neighbor, Miles.

03:41.993 --> 03:43.553
I need to know if you have these shoes.

03:43.555 --> 03:46.517
Miles, show her the picture.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.439
Remember? You gave me those.

03:48.441 --> 03:49.841
Of course, I remember.

03:49.843 --> 03:51.523
But why do you care
about some old Jordans?

03:51.525 --> 03:54.006
I just found out they're worth 25 grand.

03:54.008 --> 03:55.609
- Come again?
- Oh, yeah.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.062
Yeah, it's crazy how much
some of these retro shoes

03:58.064 --> 03:59.414
can go for now.

03:59.416 --> 04:03.379
"It's Gotta Be the Shoes!"

04:03.381 --> 04:05.702
Um, I heard a story on NPR last week.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.184
Do you know where they are?

04:07.186 --> 04:09.107
Yeah, we, um... just got
cleaned out our locker

04:09.109 --> 04:11.229
- and gave all your old stuff to your mom.
- Yes!

04:11.231 --> 04:12.791
My moms is a straight hoarder, man.

04:12.793 --> 04:14.233
It's like "Grey Gardens" up in there.

04:14.235 --> 04:15.996
She'll have them. Come on, Miles.

04:15.998 --> 04:18.702
We goin' back to the future.

04:23.127 --> 04:24.167
Why'd you lie to Tray?

04:24.169 --> 04:25.528
We never cleaned out that locker.

04:25.530 --> 04:28.212
Do you know what he
would do with $25,000?

04:28.214 --> 04:30.855
- Uh, yeah.
- We're not gonna let that money go to waste.

04:30.857 --> 04:33.018
Get the car. We goin'
to get some Jordans.

04:33.020 --> 04:35.982
- Mm.
- Might get this booty redid.

04:37.787 --> 04:39.427
Yo.

04:39.429 --> 04:41.910
- Where my mom?
- Roberta went to get a pedicure

04:41.912 --> 04:44.474
because her man got a foot fetish.

04:44.476 --> 04:46.396
Yo, don't talk about my mother's feet.

04:46.398 --> 04:48.719
Most guys like the
baby toe or the big toe.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.041
I like that middle toe...

04:50.043 --> 04:51.643
you know, the "f[BLEEP] me" toe.

04:51.645 --> 04:53.005
That turns me on.

04:53.007 --> 04:54.770
What are you playing?

04:54.772 --> 04:56.052
Playing a little "Call of Duty".

04:59.496 --> 05:02.377
What this dude do to my room, man?

05:02.379 --> 05:04.060
Aw!

05:10.710 --> 05:12.190
I don't want to know.

05:12.192 --> 05:14.834
Ugh!

05:14.836 --> 05:16.797
F[BLEEP] Carl.

05:16.799 --> 05:18.279
Yo, where my Jordans?!

05:18.281 --> 05:19.360
I have no idea.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.002
Now, I do have your Pumas,

05:21.004 --> 05:22.324
and I do have your Adidas,

05:22.326 --> 05:25.368
but I have not seen any Jordans.

05:25.370 --> 05:27.608
Where... are my...

05:27.610 --> 05:28.893
Jordans?!

05:28.895 --> 05:31.376
Thought it was in this... Nope. Come...

05:31.378 --> 05:33.819
Look in this...

05:33.821 --> 05:35.942
You hesitated before you shot.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.788
That's why you perished.

05:37.790 --> 05:39.947
Yo! I'm not playing with you!

05:39.949 --> 05:41.469
Hey!

05:41.471 --> 05:43.873
What the hell is going on here?

05:43.875 --> 05:45.314
And who is this boy?

05:45.316 --> 05:46.756
My neighbor, Miles.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.399
Hello, Mrs. Barker.

05:48.401 --> 05:51.563
Ma, where's all my old
stuff Shay gave you?

05:51.565 --> 05:52.942
Shay didn't give me anything.

05:52.944 --> 05:54.724
Shay said she gave you
all of my old stuff.

05:54.726 --> 05:58.091
It's important. Please, try to remember.

05:58.093 --> 05:59.573
Don't talk to me like that.

05:59.575 --> 06:01.176
I'm not some old senile woman!

06:01.178 --> 06:02.978
My memory is perfect.

06:02.980 --> 06:05.462
A pair of Michael Jordans
are worth $25,000.

06:05.464 --> 06:06.823
I can't find 'em.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.345
You're gonna get murked if
you remain in prone position.

06:08.347 --> 06:09.787
- Just...
- That's Gaming 101.

06:09.789 --> 06:12.911
Did you tell Shay how
much they're worth?

06:12.913 --> 06:14.954
- Why?
- That girl is playing you.

06:14.956 --> 06:17.878
She told you that she
gave me the Jordans

06:17.880 --> 06:19.440
so she could go get them herself!

06:19.442 --> 06:20.962
Aw, Shay wouldn't do me like that, Ma.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.766
Oh, money makes people do stupid stuff.

06:23.768 --> 06:27.509
I bet you those Jordans are
still i-in Shay's storage.

06:27.511 --> 06:30.659
Mm-hmm. More-Storage, 3rd and Carroll.

06:30.661 --> 06:31.816
- You know what?
- What?

06:31.818 --> 06:33.418
Ever since you gave birth to me, Ma,

06:33.420 --> 06:35.408
I knew I could count on you!

06:35.410 --> 06:37.754
I hope I can count on
you to clean up this mess.

06:37.756 --> 06:39.379
I promise you, I'll be back.

06:39.381 --> 06:41.816
I promise, Ma.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.401
Miles, come on!

06:43.403 --> 06:44.986
Yeah. Sorry.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.972
Hey, hey. How do you
throw a hand grenade?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.839
Just push triangle.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.962
Put on some pants.

06:50.964 --> 06:52.977
We're going to get those Jordans.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.364
I gave Tray the wrong storage facility.

06:55.366 --> 06:57.571
Mm, I love when you get shady.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.882
Wait a minute.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.188
This is not the place
Shay brought me to.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.630
The plot thickens.

07:09.632 --> 07:11.592
These Jordans are
tearing my family apart!

07:11.594 --> 07:13.019
They're also keeping
me from binge-watching

07:13.021 --> 07:14.677
"Mr. Robot".

07:14.679 --> 07:17.921
I'm notating continuity
errors for my Reddit thread.

07:17.923 --> 07:19.483
You need to get out more.

07:19.485 --> 07:20.965
- Let's go.
- Oh.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.703
Let's go, Miles.

07:23.705 --> 07:25.208
I'm feeling kind of torn

07:25.210 --> 07:27.574
about selling the shoes for money.

07:27.576 --> 07:30.297
Why the change of heart?

07:30.299 --> 07:32.861
They have memories attached.

07:32.863 --> 07:36.145
_

07:46.601 --> 07:49.082
See that right there. That's your baby.

07:50.406 --> 07:52.567
Oh, honey. It'll be okay.

07:52.569 --> 07:55.090
Wow. And you see this right here?

07:55.092 --> 07:57.181
- Yeah?
- That's your other baby.

07:57.183 --> 07:59.656
Wh... Why is there another baby

07:59.658 --> 08:02.060
Because you're having
twins! Congratulations!

08:02.062 --> 08:04.710
I didn't know what I
was gonna do with one,

08:04.712 --> 08:06.065
but two?

08:06.067 --> 08:08.068
- Is the father in the picture?
- Yeah.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.034
But I didn't tell him yet
because I didn't know

08:10.036 --> 08:11.432
how he was gonna react.

08:11.434 --> 08:12.594
Do you love him?

08:12.596 --> 08:13.715
Yes, I do.

08:13.717 --> 08:15.001
And does he love you?

08:15.003 --> 08:17.185
Yeah, and he would be a good dad

08:17.187 --> 08:20.029
- if he would just get his shit together.
- Then don't worry.

08:20.031 --> 08:21.814
You'll find your own way to tell him.

08:21.816 --> 08:23.776
You seem like a strong, capable woman.

08:23.778 --> 08:25.414
If you have to do this on your own,

08:25.416 --> 08:27.493
you'll be just fine.

08:27.495 --> 08:30.137
You'll have to take my word for it.

08:30.139 --> 08:31.499
I'm the doctor.

08:43.837 --> 08:45.477
Twins.

08:48.107 --> 08:50.912
For our anniversary this year,
you got me a waffle maker.

08:50.914 --> 08:53.288
- What's that say?
- That I want you to start making breakfast.

08:53.290 --> 08:54.726
You didn't update your
payment information,

08:54.728 --> 08:56.740
so your locker's been sent to auction.

08:56.742 --> 08:58.142
Why didn't you contact us?

08:58.144 --> 09:00.825
We tried, but someone said,

09:00.827 --> 09:04.831
"Stop calling my goddamn
house from a private number".

09:04.833 --> 09:06.233
Hmm.

09:06.235 --> 09:10.598
Well, well, well. If it
isn't the Black Widow.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.162
I knew you did Tray dirty.

09:13.164 --> 09:15.205
What are you doing here, "Skillet"?

09:15.207 --> 09:16.807
Tray told me about the Jordans.

09:16.809 --> 09:18.409
And I know you lied to him.

09:18.411 --> 09:20.452
Well, the fact that
you're here and he isn't

09:20.454 --> 09:23.375
makes me think that you lied, too.

09:23.377 --> 09:25.394
You know, I bought him those Jordans,

09:25.396 --> 09:28.702
so, technically, the money is mine.

09:28.704 --> 09:32.347
Besides, Tray owes me 15
years back child support.

09:32.349 --> 09:37.114
Well, I gave birth to Tray,
so he owes me his life.

09:37.116 --> 09:38.956
Plus six months' rent.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.678
Hey, can't we just split it?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.200
- Hell no!
- Hell no!

09:42.202 --> 09:45.765
Listen, when my husband died,
he left me no insurance.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.409
I had to take care
of Tray all by myself.

09:48.411 --> 09:50.705
For 30 years, I got up every morning

09:50.707 --> 09:55.138
and worked 14 hours a day
just to make ends meet, okay?

09:55.140 --> 09:57.421
- Now I'm in the prime of my life...
- Mm-hmm.

09:57.423 --> 10:00.184
... and you can be sure
I'mma get something for me.

10:00.186 --> 10:02.387
Well, I did all that times two.

10:02.389 --> 10:04.470
Well, neither of you
are getting any money

10:04.472 --> 10:07.514
because this joker sent our
unit to the auction block.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.601
I-I can give you the address
of where they're auctioning it.

10:12.603 --> 10:15.233
Oh, could you write it down, please?

10:15.235 --> 10:16.606
And put it in my hand.

10:16.608 --> 10:18.809
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

10:18.811 --> 10:22.053
If you know what's good
for you, you will do that.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.495
Uh...

10:23.497 --> 10:25.138
I hate conflict!

10:26.221 --> 10:29.423
Gimme that.

10:29.425 --> 10:33.148
Come on.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.712
Two black women yelling profanities?

10:35.714 --> 10:37.274
Yep. That's them.

10:37.276 --> 10:39.837
Can you tell us where they're headed?

10:39.839 --> 10:41.519
Okay. Thanks.

10:41.521 --> 10:44.203
They're headed to an
auction house in Flatbush.

10:44.205 --> 10:46.646
We're closer. We'll
get there ahead of them.

10:46.648 --> 10:48.792
Time to get "Fast and Furious".

10:48.794 --> 10:50.601
In my car, you'll
have to settle for slow

10:50.603 --> 10:52.975
and fuel-efficient.

10:52.977 --> 10:55.858
Damn it, Miles! You
are cooking my grits!

10:56.902 --> 10:59.223
1,200!

10:59.225 --> 11:00.264
$1,400!

11:00.266 --> 11:01.906
Do I hear 1,450?

11:03.991 --> 11:05.431
Sold to this man and his wife!

11:05.433 --> 11:07.073
- Hey!
- Oh!

11:07.075 --> 11:08.916
Aw, that's got to hurt.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.998
God don't like ugly.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.123
Should be in smaller increments.

11:17.329 --> 11:19.249
Oh, my God. I hate dolls.

11:19.251 --> 11:21.576
127? This isn't ours.

11:21.578 --> 11:23.215
God don't like stank either!

11:23.217 --> 11:24.657
I'll check and see where your locker is.

11:24.659 --> 11:27.020
But these dolls are yours now.

11:27.022 --> 11:29.303
No. No, they're not.

11:29.305 --> 11:30.625
Well, well, well.

11:30.627 --> 11:33.749
What a surprise. My own mother.

11:33.751 --> 11:35.030
Don't look at me like that.

11:35.032 --> 11:37.834
And you, the mother of my children.

11:37.836 --> 11:40.037
I always knew it would be you, Fredo.

11:40.039 --> 11:41.359
You broke my heart.

11:41.361 --> 11:42.440
Looks like it was bought

11:42.442 --> 11:43.762
by St. Mary's Church this morning

11:43.764 --> 11:45.845
and sent to their shelter in Queens.

11:45.847 --> 11:47.327
Got it.

11:47.329 --> 11:48.849
Every man for himself!

11:50.693 --> 11:54.359
What are you doing in my purse?!

11:54.361 --> 11:55.504
I don't know!

11:55.506 --> 11:56.819
- I had 'em.
- We got to open it.

11:56.821 --> 11:59.102
Hey. Y'all looking for these?

11:59.104 --> 12:01.105
You pick-pocketed your own mother?

12:01.107 --> 12:02.507
What's that taste in your mouth?

12:02.509 --> 12:03.949
Sweet revenge?

12:03.951 --> 12:06.072
Ha ha!

12:06.074 --> 12:09.136
- Josh, call an Uber.
- Carl, call a Lyft.

12:12.068 --> 12:14.772
- Are you the manager?
- Um, yes, but I'm sorry.

12:14.774 --> 12:16.775
We've filled up. We have
no more beds tonight.

12:16.777 --> 12:20.982
We're not homeless.
Do... Do we look homeless?

12:22.905 --> 12:25.747
I'm not homeless.
Have you seen these shoes?

12:25.749 --> 12:28.430
Well, we received a
donation shipment today,

12:28.432 --> 12:30.513
but it's already been
distributed amongst the needy.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.836
- Well, do you know who has them?
- We don't keep a record.

12:32.838 --> 12:35.400
They could be anywhere on the premises.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.807
Come on, Carl.

12:44.374 --> 12:46.735
Sorry, bathrooms for homeless only.

12:58.232 --> 13:01.795
Psst, honey, come here.

13:01.797 --> 13:04.150
Are those them?

13:04.152 --> 13:06.296
Can't tell. We got to get closer.

13:09.605 --> 13:13.810
If you two want a look...
you don't gotta be shy.

13:15.014 --> 13:16.174
Uh...

13:16.176 --> 13:18.417
Ohh.

13:18.419 --> 13:21.501
- Not Jordans and not...
- Not bad.

13:24.066 --> 13:27.068
I don't know. It seemed like a...

13:27.070 --> 13:28.110
Roberta?

13:28.112 --> 13:29.592
Is that you?

13:29.594 --> 13:31.034
It's me, Monty!

13:31.036 --> 13:32.716
Monty Stevens!

13:32.718 --> 13:35.399
Monty!

13:35.401 --> 13:38.523
Oh, I don't believe it! I
haven't seen you in years!

13:38.525 --> 13:40.711
I haven't seen you since the prom!

13:40.713 --> 13:42.994
And you were the most
beautiful girl there.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.556
Still are.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.664
And who's this handsome
young man you're with?

13:46.666 --> 13:48.841
- Your son?
- No. I'm her Daddy.

13:48.843 --> 13:51.124
- Right, Roberta?
- Yes.

13:51.126 --> 13:53.287
You back up there, silver Fox.

13:53.289 --> 13:55.570
You might've had her
first, but I got her last.

13:55.572 --> 13:57.293
Oh.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.817
You sexy when you get jealous.

14:00.819 --> 14:03.220
Hey, move your feet, lose your seat.

14:03.222 --> 14:06.104
Stop, you crazy.

14:07.588 --> 14:09.909
Tray, look.

14:09.911 --> 14:11.031
Oh!

14:13.957 --> 14:15.837
- Who are you?!
- Oh!

14:15.839 --> 14:18.000
- What do you want?!
- Those shoes in your cart are mine.

14:18.002 --> 14:19.602
I'd like to get them back.

14:19.604 --> 14:21.405
And I'd like to marry Jeff Goldblum

14:21.407 --> 14:24.048
in a small and intimate
ceremony in Napa.

14:24.050 --> 14:25.851
Please, they mean a lot to me.

14:25.853 --> 14:28.294
Really? How much?

14:28.296 --> 14:30.136
I'll give you whatever you want.

14:30.138 --> 14:32.179
How 'bout a kiss?

14:32.181 --> 14:34.021
- How 'bout you kiss him first?
- What?

14:34.023 --> 14:37.226
No, I want you to kiss me on the lips.

14:39.431 --> 14:42.272
Alright. Okay. Okay.

14:45.358 --> 14:46.798
Hey!

14:46.800 --> 14:48.200
Okay.

14:48.202 --> 14:51.130
Okay!

14:51.132 --> 14:53.275
- Mwah!
- Aah!

14:53.277 --> 14:55.890
Oh, there he is. Tray.

14:55.892 --> 14:59.615
Hand over the shoes.
Don't make Mama get mad.

14:59.617 --> 15:00.977
No, give 'em to me, Tray.

15:00.979 --> 15:02.326
You know you're just
gonna blow that money

15:02.328 --> 15:03.501
on foolishness.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.583
Is that what y'all think?

15:05.585 --> 15:08.467
Y'all think I don't
appreciate y'all's sacrifice?

15:08.469 --> 15:11.271
This was my opportunity to spoil y'all.

15:11.273 --> 15:14.035
Ma, I was gonna get you
that gold necklace...

15:14.037 --> 15:16.862
and I'm not talking about the
one that turn your neck green...

15:16.864 --> 15:18.856
and some roses and everything,
because you said

15:18.858 --> 15:20.964
nobody ever gave you none.

15:20.966 --> 15:24.128
And two tickets to Sinbad's
Funk Festival in Aruba.

15:24.130 --> 15:25.410
Ohh.

15:25.412 --> 15:27.052
And, Shay...

15:27.054 --> 15:29.535
I was gonna get you
a Malaysian lace front

15:29.537 --> 15:31.818
with the gold hoop earrings,

15:31.820 --> 15:35.583
with that hot-pink
"Bootylicious" Beyoncé outfit

15:35.585 --> 15:37.906
to go on your dream vacation to Paris.

15:37.908 --> 15:41.271
And, Josh, I was gonna
get you those golf clubs.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.113
Hey. Hey. What about me?

15:43.115 --> 15:45.076
No, I didn't forget about you, Carl.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.518
I was gonna get two hard,

15:46.520 --> 15:48.080
pipe-wieldin' dudes from Brooklyn

15:48.082 --> 15:50.563
to go Medieval on your ass.

15:50.565 --> 15:53.130
- Okay.
- I am so sorry, Tray.

15:53.132 --> 15:56.085
I didn't realize how... how
good your intentions were.

15:56.087 --> 15:57.973
Yeah, Shay's right.

15:57.975 --> 16:00.456
We got a little blinded by our greed.

16:00.458 --> 16:01.985
It's okay.

16:01.987 --> 16:03.981
We all behaved badly.

16:03.983 --> 16:05.423
Ma, come on in here.

16:05.425 --> 16:07.986
Let's say a prayer.
You lead us in prayer.

16:07.988 --> 16:09.869
Ohh! Okay.

16:12.274 --> 16:16.998
Oh, Lord, forgive us,
for we have sinned.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.802
Please bring peace to our hearts

16:19.804 --> 16:24.648
and make us more like my son, Tray.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.252
Generous. Loving.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.854
Kind.

16:28.856 --> 16:30.897
Amen.

16:30.899 --> 16:32.138
Amen.

16:34.023 --> 16:35.383
That little mother...

16:41.787 --> 16:43.290
Aah! Yes!

16:43.292 --> 16:46.478
25K in full effect, baby.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.568
_

17:06.028 --> 17:07.451
You got to be kidding me.

17:07.453 --> 17:09.997
Been a long time, Tray. How you doing?

17:09.999 --> 17:12.022
Not as good as you.

17:12.025 --> 17:13.647
Is that a Louis Vuitton bag?

17:13.650 --> 17:15.914
That it is. You know the drill.

17:15.915 --> 17:20.121
Run 'em. Throw 'em in the pouch.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.589
Tray Leviticus Barker, you invoked

17:40.591 --> 17:42.782
the name of the Lord
in your deviousness.

17:42.784 --> 17:43.914
Hand over those shoes!

17:43.916 --> 17:47.118
I got jacked. Shay.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.401
I'm sorry I didn't see this.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.163
Things would've been
different if I would've just

17:51.165 --> 17:52.405
tried those shoes on.

17:52.407 --> 17:53.710
There's no way to really know,

17:53.712 --> 17:56.016
but it would've been nice
to see those shoes again.

17:56.018 --> 17:57.842
Okay, well, let's go home.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.427
My dogs are barking.

17:59.429 --> 18:01.217
I'mma treat them dogs like a chew toy.

18:01.219 --> 18:02.939
- Yi-yi-yi!
- Stop it.

18:02.941 --> 18:05.302
Miles, let me get you home
so you can finish your Reddit.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.465
No way... This is better

18:07.467 --> 18:09.187
than any WorldStar video I've ever seen.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.355
If you want to get your Jordans back,

18:11.357 --> 18:14.943
there's only one place
you can get them verified.

18:14.945 --> 18:16.328
Let's go get your Jordans.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.913
Let's go.

18:21.446 --> 18:23.567
Yo! Wait a minute!
Those shoes belong to us!

18:23.569 --> 18:25.129
Yeah?

18:25.131 --> 18:26.170
Prove it.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.493
May I?

18:28.495 --> 18:30.255
"Amira.

18:30.257 --> 18:31.898
Shahzad".

18:31.900 --> 18:34.461
Those are the names that
I picked out for our kids.

18:34.463 --> 18:35.903
You wrote in them?

18:35.905 --> 18:37.986
I'm sorry, but they gotta
be in mint condition

18:37.988 --> 18:40.586
to be considered collector's items.

18:40.588 --> 18:42.492
Man, take your worthless shit.

18:42.494 --> 18:44.995
They worthless to you.

18:44.997 --> 18:47.278
They priceless to me.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.640
Let's go.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.306
Run it.

18:57.255 --> 19:00.576
- Sorry about your Jordans, Tray.
- You know what?

19:00.578 --> 19:04.181
Sometime, I feel like an
old pair of Jordans myself.

19:04.183 --> 19:06.370
I used to be the guy
that make you proud,

19:06.372 --> 19:07.692
but these streets,

19:07.694 --> 19:09.855
they scuffed me up pretty bad, Shay.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.338
Tray, you are rough around the edges

19:12.340 --> 19:15.102
and hard-headed at times...

19:15.104 --> 19:18.066
but your heart is priceless.

19:18.068 --> 19:19.828
- Thank you.
- They are just a pair of shoes.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.900
Eventually, they will
fade and fall apart.

19:22.902 --> 19:24.274
You're right.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.640
Excuse me, Shay.

19:32.767 --> 19:35.828
My man.

19:35.830 --> 19:38.414
Here you go.

19:38.416 --> 19:42.002
For you.

19:42.004 --> 19:43.066
My dear.

19:43.068 --> 19:45.342
My dear.

19:45.344 --> 19:48.867
Aw, this nigga wrote in 'em.
