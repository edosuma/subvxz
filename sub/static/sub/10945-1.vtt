00:00.070 --> 00:01.429
<i>Previously on "heartland":</i>

00:01.430 --> 00:03.999
Peter and I have been doing
some talking and...

00:04.066 --> 00:07.068
<i>We talked to Clint about
becoming your foster parents.</i>

00:07.136 --> 00:08.937
You're actually not half bad.

00:08.971 --> 00:10.605
It would have been fun jumping
against you on the circuit.

00:10.673 --> 00:12.207
What do you mean
"would have been"?

00:12.241 --> 00:13.675
Everybody knows that foster kids
don't hang around for long.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.409
I'm not going anywhere!

00:15.443 --> 00:16.643
<i>And now that you
are finally engaged</i>

00:16.711 --> 00:18.879
you're eloping?!

00:18.947 --> 00:21.748
No! No, flipping way!
I deserve a wedding!

00:21.783 --> 00:23.250
- We're not eloping.
- You're not?

00:23.285 --> 00:25.385
I was invited to lead
a horse clinic in Vegas

00:25.453 --> 00:27.254
and Ty and I thought we could
make a road trip out of it.

00:27.322 --> 00:29.156
Hey, where's grandpa?

00:33.360 --> 00:34.694
I need-I need some help.
I need an ambulance!

00:34.761 --> 00:36.229
Heartland ranch.

01:08.727 --> 01:10.862
Poor paint.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.730
He won't even hang out
with the other horses anymore.

01:12.764 --> 01:13.630
It's not good for him.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.467
He'll be fine.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.370
How are you doing?

01:20.404 --> 01:21.071
I'm okay.

01:23.341 --> 01:27.577
Dad's driving everyone crazy.
It's his way or the highway.

01:27.611 --> 01:30.571
It's just not the same.

01:31.182 --> 01:32.548
<i>I want to know when
you made that decision</i>

01:32.583 --> 01:34.783
and why you didn't tell me!

01:34.817 --> 01:37.586
Lou, I can't keep you
in the loop on everything.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.621
It's easier
if I just do it myself,

01:39.689 --> 01:41.790
get it done.

01:41.824 --> 01:43.125
Yeah, it's easier all right

01:43.159 --> 01:44.793
because you knew
I wouldn't agree with you!

01:44.827 --> 01:46.595
Hey, kid,

01:46.629 --> 01:48.663
<i>I thought I asked you</i>
<i>to clean up the tack area.</i>

01:48.698 --> 01:50.564
So get on it,
it's not gonna clean up itself.

01:52.368 --> 01:53.334
<i>Honey, could you
look in on her first?</i>

01:53.369 --> 01:54.135
You can do the tack after,
okay?

01:54.203 --> 01:55.336
Lou.

01:56.705 --> 01:57.705
I'm worried about her.

01:57.739 --> 01:59.274
I'm not, she's fine.

01:59.308 --> 02:01.042
She just needs direction.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.777
Dad, listen,

02:02.844 --> 02:04.379
I know things are different
around here

02:04.413 --> 02:06.313
and someone needs
to take control,

02:06.347 --> 02:08.382
but I have to say, you know,

02:08.416 --> 02:10.083
grandpa would want me to.

02:10.118 --> 02:11.484
You got a lot on your plate.

02:11.519 --> 02:13.453
No, I don't. I'm fine.

02:14.455 --> 02:16.489
I'm much better than I was.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.361
Dad...

02:21.396 --> 02:23.662
Sweetheart, I'll take care
of the day-to-day workings

02:23.730 --> 02:25.764
of the ranch,

02:25.799 --> 02:27.733
because this was thrown
on my shoulders.

02:27.767 --> 02:28.968
God knows I didn't ask for it.

02:34.074 --> 02:35.174
Where do you think
you're gonna put them?

02:35.242 --> 02:36.542
Right there,

02:36.609 --> 02:38.643
as soon I get rid
of those old wrecks.

02:38.710 --> 02:42.013
Grandpa's trucks?!
No, dad, no way!

02:42.048 --> 02:43.614
I need room for the new pen,
Lou,

02:43.649 --> 02:45.483
a lot more than I need
those old eyesores.

02:45.551 --> 02:46.551
They should've been towed away
a long time ago.

02:46.618 --> 02:48.453
They're not going anywhere.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.688
You gotta get rid of the old
to make room for the new.

02:50.756 --> 02:51.990
That's the only way to deal.

02:52.058 --> 02:53.425
No, dad,
that's the only way you deal!

03:01.666 --> 03:02.333
Hey, Scott.

03:05.403 --> 03:06.337
The airport?

03:08.006 --> 03:10.173
Amy too?

03:10.240 --> 03:11.441
Okay, we'll be right there.

03:11.508 --> 03:12.842
Okay, bye.

03:12.909 --> 03:14.944
Let's go.

03:19.916 --> 03:21.917
Take it easy, take it easy!
Hey! Hey!

03:24.921 --> 03:26.788
Come on. Whoa! Easy.

03:26.822 --> 03:28.223
Scott?

03:28.257 --> 03:29.191
Glad to see you guys.

03:30.493 --> 03:32.427
<i>This one's a handful.</i>

03:32.462 --> 03:35.030
It's okay.
Whoa, whoa, boy.

03:35.098 --> 03:36.098
Is he injured?

03:36.132 --> 03:36.931
I don't think so.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.633
Easy...

03:38.667 --> 03:39.401
<i>But we need to
get him to the clinic.</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:40.335
Good boy.

03:43.805 --> 03:44.905
What's his name?

03:44.939 --> 03:46.507
His name's emir.

03:46.541 --> 03:48.942
Hi, emir.

03:48.977 --> 03:50.911
No one's gonna hurt you.
You're okay.

03:52.347 --> 03:55.471
Wow. Nice work.

03:57.319 --> 03:58.885
That's a good boy. Good boy.

04:00.421 --> 04:02.222
Adrian gilson.

04:02.256 --> 04:04.090
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.025
The team vet was supposed
to be here,

04:05.059 --> 04:06.559
but his flight was delayed.

04:06.593 --> 04:08.194
No worries. Glad we can help.

04:08.229 --> 04:09.029
It's a beautiful horse
you have.

04:10.531 --> 04:12.798
It's not my horse.
I'm just the groom.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.034
That's his owner over there.

04:19.839 --> 04:20.605
He doesn't seem too
concerned, does he?

04:21.507 --> 04:23.608
Excuse me.

04:23.643 --> 04:25.810
Yes?

04:25.845 --> 04:27.712
Ah, yes.
Well, I just thought that uh...

04:27.747 --> 04:29.181
<i>Absolutely, I understand.</i>

04:29.215 --> 04:31.282
I do.

04:31.316 --> 04:34.552
Okay, good. Right.
No, I'm fine.

04:34.586 --> 04:36.087
The owner doesn't want emir
taken to your clinic.

04:36.121 --> 04:37.055
He wants him taken
right to hillhurst.

04:37.089 --> 04:38.156
Can you trailer him?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.890
No, that's ridiculous!

04:39.925 --> 04:41.392
He needs to go
to Scott's clinic.

04:41.427 --> 04:42.960
His injuries might
not be apparent, but...

04:42.994 --> 04:43.827
Just tell him that!

04:45.964 --> 04:49.767
His royal highness, the prince,
isn't told anything.

04:49.801 --> 04:50.601
A prince?

05:12.255 --> 05:14.523

Good boy.

05:46.855 --> 05:49.023
He really is incredible.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.757
What brings you to Hudson?

05:50.825 --> 05:51.891
The team's trying
to make the next Olympics,

05:51.926 --> 05:53.960
so we need
north American exposure.

05:54.028 --> 05:55.895
The world cup qualifiers,
next week, will help,

05:55.963 --> 05:57.296
<i>if we do well.</i>

05:57.364 --> 05:59.799
Hopefully.
We could use a break.

05:59.867 --> 06:02.869
Who are these people?

06:02.937 --> 06:04.104
I'm Scott cardinal-

06:04.138 --> 06:06.606
Uh, Scott's a
vet here in Hudson,

06:06.673 --> 06:07.973
and this is his assistant,
Ty borden,

06:08.041 --> 06:09.241
and Amy Fleming,

06:09.308 --> 06:11.043
and if I may please introduce

06:11.111 --> 06:13.812
his royal highness
prince Ahmed Al saeed.

06:13.847 --> 06:15.948
I don't want strangers
anywhere near my horse.

06:15.982 --> 06:17.349
See that they leave.

06:19.719 --> 06:20.352
You're welcome.

06:22.921 --> 06:24.122
<i>A prince?</i>

06:24.156 --> 06:26.758
Like actual royalty,
in Hudson?

06:26.825 --> 06:28.660
Ty he's part of his
national equestrian team.

06:28.727 --> 06:30.928
They've taken over
most of the hillhurst operation.

06:30.996 --> 06:32.130
Yeah, but you
wouldn't believe this guy.

06:32.197 --> 06:34.632
Prince or not,
he barely looked at his horse,

06:34.700 --> 06:36.067
and he wouldn't let Scott
take him to his clinic

06:36.135 --> 06:37.769
to see if he was seriously
hurt or not.

06:37.836 --> 06:39.369
Oh, come on.

06:39.403 --> 06:41.404
Sounds like this horse
is a hugely successful jumper.

06:41.438 --> 06:43.106
He's probably worth

06:43.141 --> 06:45.508
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

06:45.543 --> 06:47.644
I get why the guy wants
his own vets to look at him.

06:47.712 --> 06:49.646
Yeah, but he could
care less about that horse.

06:49.681 --> 06:50.981
Well, he's a prince.

06:51.015 --> 06:52.683
He probably has a dozen
more emirs

06:52.717 --> 06:54.317
just waiting in the wings.

06:54.351 --> 06:56.786
I think if Scott plays
his cards right,

06:56.820 --> 06:58.453
get on the good side
of this guy, huh?

06:59.823 --> 07:02.257
Um, I'm not hungry.
Can I be excused?

07:02.292 --> 07:03.125
Yeah, honey, sure.

07:07.931 --> 07:10.532
Speaking of playing
your cards right,

07:10.567 --> 07:13.568
I noticed you didn't have
many clients on your board.

07:13.602 --> 07:15.436
Dad.

07:15.470 --> 07:17.105
No, I'm just saying

07:17.139 --> 07:18.973
you've got umpteen rescue horses
out there,

07:19.041 --> 07:20.675
they're eating us
out of house and home,

07:20.710 --> 07:21.442
<i>no income coming in?</i>

07:21.476 --> 07:22.777
Dad.

07:22.812 --> 07:24.512
Amy, listen.

07:24.546 --> 07:26.147
You know,
I've been very patient

07:26.182 --> 07:28.548
with what you're going through,

07:28.583 --> 07:31.318
but an income stops,
it's got consequences.

07:31.352 --> 07:32.586
So I put an ad up in Maggie's.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.754
<i>For what?</i>

07:33.788 --> 07:34.755
To sell those rescue horses.

07:34.823 --> 07:36.056
Dad, that's my decision!

07:36.091 --> 07:38.125
No, honey, when it starts
costing us money,

07:38.159 --> 07:39.059
<i>it's my decision.</i>

07:43.097 --> 07:44.831
It's Adrian.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.399
The groom? Yeah.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.769
He wants me to come meet him
at hillhurst tomorrow.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.939
- There's an opportunity.
- A prince as a client.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.539
Just sayin'.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.777
Hey.

08:00.213 --> 08:00.846
You okay?

08:04.817 --> 08:07.786
I can sit with you for a while
if you want me to.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.489
I know you're still getting used
to sleeping in here.

08:11.523 --> 08:13.892
It's just not the same.

08:13.926 --> 08:17.561
Well, it'll take a while
to feel like this is your room.

08:17.595 --> 08:19.730
It's not the room,
it's everything.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.234
Yeah.

08:24.870 --> 08:27.271
When's Peter coming home?

08:27.338 --> 08:31.340
A couple of days, I hope. Why?

08:31.375 --> 08:32.075
Just curious.

08:33.577 --> 08:34.443
Okay. Good night.

08:37.514 --> 08:39.215
You sure you're okay?

08:39.250 --> 08:40.482
Yeah. Good night.

08:42.886 --> 08:44.687
Um, listen,

08:46.356 --> 08:49.158
I know you don't think so now,

08:49.225 --> 08:51.293
but everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

09:11.046 --> 09:12.112
They're amazing!

09:12.180 --> 09:13.613
I've never seen horses
like those.

09:13.647 --> 09:15.682
Yeah, they are pretty special.

09:15.749 --> 09:17.717
Amy, hi! Hey.

09:17.785 --> 09:19.552
Thanks for comin'.

09:19.586 --> 09:21.221
So I probably shouldn't
have called,

09:21.255 --> 09:24.757
but, uh, well, I did see this
on the community board.

09:24.826 --> 09:27.127
I looked at your site.
You have quite the reputation.

09:27.161 --> 09:28.560
Thank you.

09:28.628 --> 09:29.929
<i>So here's the thing,</i>

09:29.996 --> 09:32.464
I'm not really making
any progress with emir.

09:32.532 --> 09:35.634
In fact,
I think he's gettin' worse.

09:35.702 --> 09:37.469
Would you take a look at him,

09:37.503 --> 09:39.205
perhaps calm him down
like you did yesterday?

09:39.239 --> 09:41.406
Well...

09:41.441 --> 09:43.342
Does your boss know that
you asked me to work with him?

09:43.376 --> 09:44.642
I mean, he seemed
pretty particular

09:44.676 --> 09:46.044
about who's around his horse.

09:46.078 --> 09:47.545
Oh, he's at a lunch meeting,

09:47.612 --> 09:48.346
won't be back
for a couple hours.

09:51.516 --> 09:52.817
Okay, I guess.

09:52.852 --> 09:53.684
Great. Thanks.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.956
Oh, uh, I don't think
it's gonna be safe for her.

09:57.990 --> 09:59.190
Do you mind?

09:59.225 --> 10:00.123
Yeah, I can stay here.

10:00.158 --> 10:01.091
Okay. Good.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.367
<i>So the prince has
threatened to sell him</i>

10:10.401 --> 10:11.869
if there's no improvement.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.636
I've tried everything I know.

10:13.671 --> 10:15.239
I've never seen him like this.

10:17.540 --> 10:18.374
<i>I think maybe he's
equating this stall</i>

10:18.408 --> 10:20.642
to the one on the plane.

10:20.677 --> 10:24.513
You know, he's expecting
to be hurt or something.

10:24.547 --> 10:26.249
Do you mind
if I walk him around

10:26.283 --> 10:28.317
and try and calm him down?

10:28.352 --> 10:29.685
Well, I've tried that,
but sure, have a go.

10:35.124 --> 10:37.692
What are you doing here?

10:37.726 --> 10:39.261
I'm here with Amy.
She's helping a horse.

10:39.295 --> 10:40.695
Really.

10:40.729 --> 10:42.297
He actually belongs
to a prince.

10:42.331 --> 10:43.464
What are you doing here?

10:43.499 --> 10:46.101
I'm just shopping
for a new horse.

10:46.135 --> 10:48.769
My father knows
one of the owners.

10:48.803 --> 10:51.005
So this dance at school,
you going?

10:54.075 --> 10:55.742
Oh, wait,
it's a father/daughter dance,

10:55.810 --> 10:57.544
isn't it?

10:57.612 --> 10:59.213
I guess that could be
a problem,

10:59.247 --> 11:01.181
seeing as you don't have
a father.

11:01.216 --> 11:03.683
I do so have a father.
His name is Peter.

11:03.718 --> 11:06.152
Ah, you call him
by his first name,

11:06.220 --> 11:08.721
like that's a real father,
for sure.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.822
He is so real!

11:11.858 --> 11:14.493
What's she talking
about, Georgie?

11:14.528 --> 11:16.963
Real father?
What does she mean?

11:17.031 --> 11:18.932
Come on, you can tell me.

11:18.966 --> 11:21.366
There's a dance at school.

11:21.401 --> 11:24.002
So what's the problem?

11:24.037 --> 11:25.404
It's a father/daughter dance.

11:33.146 --> 11:34.846
Is that the prince?

11:34.880 --> 11:37.848
Yeah.

11:37.916 --> 11:39.683
What is she doing here again?

11:39.751 --> 11:40.584
I called her.

11:40.652 --> 11:41.785
You called her?

11:41.820 --> 11:43.421
Adrian was worried about emir.

11:43.488 --> 11:44.755
He's still traumatized
by the flight.

11:44.823 --> 11:46.757
I thought maybe I could help.

11:46.825 --> 11:49.427
I have a retinue of people
to do that - experts.

11:49.494 --> 11:50.494
It's not always easy to know

11:50.562 --> 11:52.262
why an animal
does what it does.

11:52.330 --> 11:54.897
Oh, so now we know more
than the professionals,

11:54.966 --> 11:56.466
is that right?

11:56.533 --> 11:58.768
I know what I'm doing.

11:58.836 --> 12:01.390
Yes, of course you do.

12:01.872 --> 12:03.673
My vet has looked
at the animal.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.375
It's clear
that it's damaged goods.

12:05.443 --> 12:06.609
I have three other horses

12:06.677 --> 12:07.477
being shipped in from Belgium.

12:07.544 --> 12:08.810
I'll choose from them.

12:08.878 --> 12:11.546
Now please leave
or I'll call security!

12:14.250 --> 12:16.852
He's a tough guy.

12:16.919 --> 12:18.587
How long has he been
riding emir?

12:18.654 --> 12:21.390
A little over a year.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.358
<i>He must feel
something for the horse.</i>

12:24.059 --> 12:25.526
That would take an emotion.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.794
As far as I can see,
he has none.

12:30.366 --> 12:32.033
He's horrible.
Prince not-so-charming.

12:32.101 --> 12:33.301
I just don't understand
why he would bring in

12:33.369 --> 12:35.370
three other
ridiculously expensive horses.

12:35.404 --> 12:36.604
Because it's a mindset.

12:36.638 --> 12:38.272
You know,
he can afford to be choosy

12:38.307 --> 12:40.107
and a lot's at stake
in that world.

12:40.174 --> 12:40.740
You know, Amy, if anyone can
get through to this guy

12:40.808 --> 12:41.975
you can.

12:42.010 --> 12:42.876
Are you kidding me?

12:42.943 --> 12:43.776
<i>No way!</i>

12:43.844 --> 12:45.178
He's a sexist pig.

12:45.213 --> 12:47.014
Georgie, where did you ever-?

12:47.081 --> 12:48.315
<i>Well, she's actually right.</i>

12:48.349 --> 12:49.082
That's why he's treating me
like this,

12:49.117 --> 12:50.650
'cause I'm a girl!

12:50.684 --> 12:52.986
You know,
you saw it, right, Ty?

12:53.021 --> 12:55.022
Oh, hey, it's Peter.

12:55.056 --> 12:55.955
He's gonna get home
for a few days.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.094
Is he coming home for that
father/daughter dance thing?

13:02.129 --> 13:03.829
Georgie was telling me
about it.

13:03.863 --> 13:06.165
Um, that's the first
I've heard about it.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.303
You forgot your sandwich.

13:16.142 --> 13:18.043
Hey.

13:18.077 --> 13:20.345
So what's this I hear
about a father/daughter dance?

13:20.379 --> 13:22.180
Oh.

13:22.214 --> 13:24.215
I had to hear
about it from Amy.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.184
It's nothing.
I'm not going.

13:26.218 --> 13:28.385
Why?

13:28.420 --> 13:28.952
I'm just not
going, that's all.

13:32.457 --> 13:34.591
You know you can talk to me
about it, if you want.

13:34.625 --> 13:35.325
Well, I don't want to.

13:38.430 --> 13:39.129
Okay.

13:42.100 --> 13:42.832
And you're gonna be home
in plenty of time

13:42.867 --> 13:44.700
for this, right?

13:44.734 --> 13:46.302
Okay,
because I'm pretty certain

13:46.336 --> 13:47.603
she's only pretending
she doesn't want to go.

13:49.606 --> 13:50.839
I'm worried, Peter.

13:50.874 --> 13:53.543
I mean, she's had a lot
to deal with lately.

13:55.011 --> 13:55.844
We all have.

13:57.847 --> 14:00.449
Yeah. I love you, too.
Okay, bye.

14:28.469 --> 14:29.536
<i>agh! Get off me!</i>

14:30.671 --> 14:31.744
<i>What are you doin'?! Back off!</i>

14:34.041 --> 14:35.641
Dad, what is going on?!

14:37.110 --> 14:39.412
It's okay.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.113
<i>What? Grandpa?!</i>

14:41.148 --> 14:42.648
You're back!

14:42.715 --> 14:43.615
You scared the hell out of me.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.583
<i>I scared you?!</i>

14:44.617 --> 14:45.584
How about
the other way around?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.253
What are you...?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.321
Jack! Hey!

14:50.889 --> 14:52.190
How are you?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.191
Good. How are you?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.259
Good.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.693
<i>Now here I am,</i>

14:55.761 --> 14:57.162
I'm trying to be
as quiet as I can,

14:57.229 --> 14:58.964
and the last thing I expected

14:59.031 --> 15:00.465
was to crawl into bed
with you!

15:00.532 --> 15:01.866
What are you doin' in my room?

15:01.934 --> 15:03.101
I was sleeping.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.569
Why are you sleeping
in my room?

15:05.636 --> 15:06.370
He's been staying here a
few nights a week, grandpa.

15:06.438 --> 15:07.338
Thank you.

15:07.372 --> 15:08.772
Why are you staying here?

15:08.840 --> 15:09.539
Because while you've
been sunning yourself

15:09.607 --> 15:11.008
down in Arizona,

15:11.076 --> 15:13.242
I've been busy running
the operations around here.

15:13.310 --> 15:16.012
Now I told you that Lou
and Amy would handle things.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.081
Yeah, well, that
didn't happen, Jack!

15:18.148 --> 15:20.851
Okay, so... No, never mind.

15:20.918 --> 15:22.051
You know,
that's the thanks I get.

15:23.721 --> 15:24.387
Good to have you back.
Good to-

15:24.421 --> 15:24.754
Dad.

15:26.757 --> 15:27.990
I was gonna move
his stuff out,

15:28.024 --> 15:30.125
but we weren't expecting you
for days.

15:30.193 --> 15:30.926
Well, I shouldn't
have gone to Arizona

15:30.961 --> 15:32.194
in the first place.

15:32.228 --> 15:33.195
Well, it wasn't your choice.

15:33.229 --> 15:34.997
You know, after your...

15:37.133 --> 15:38.667
Heart attack.

15:38.702 --> 15:41.537
I had a heart attack, Lou,
you can say it.

15:41.571 --> 15:44.205
Yes, well, the trip
was doctor's orders

15:44.272 --> 15:46.107
and I'm glad you went.
I mean, look at you.

15:46.141 --> 15:47.909
You're all healthy
and rested and zen.

15:49.645 --> 15:52.146
Zen? I'm not that.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.216
So, grandpa, how was Arizona?

15:55.283 --> 15:57.351
Ah, it was fine,
but a month was way too long.

15:57.386 --> 15:59.153
Now what the heck is this?

15:59.221 --> 16:01.054
<i>Oh, it's nothing.</i>

16:01.122 --> 16:03.356
<i>Tim bought it. I
told him you'd hate it,</i>

16:03.424 --> 16:03.857
but he wouldn't take it back.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.395
Where's my old coffee maker?

16:08.429 --> 16:10.564
Grandpa, how
about you go unpack

16:10.598 --> 16:12.032
and I will make you
a cup of herbal tea.

16:12.066 --> 16:14.535
I don't want a cup
of herbal tea.

16:14.569 --> 16:18.571
I want a cup of coffee
made on my own coffee maker!

16:18.605 --> 16:21.473
Okay, he is clearly not zen.
He is easily upset,

16:21.508 --> 16:24.343
and that is the last thing
that we want!

16:24.377 --> 16:25.344
We have to make him think
that everything went smoothly

16:25.378 --> 16:26.846
while he was gone.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.281
Lou, it didn't. Dos to lie?

16:29.315 --> 16:33.217
Yes, I want you to lie,
for grandpa's sake, okay?

16:33.252 --> 16:35.386
He hates change.
You know that!

16:35.421 --> 16:36.755
You know
you have to rethink this,

16:36.789 --> 16:38.924
'cause it will put him
right back to square one!

16:38.958 --> 16:40.959
Well, if he hadn't
have come home early,

16:40.993 --> 16:42.627
they'd already be here by now

16:42.662 --> 16:44.462
and he wouldn't have noticed
any change at all.

16:44.496 --> 16:46.397
Yes, he is home early
and he will notice,

16:46.432 --> 16:48.899
so just call and cancel, okay?

17:10.721 --> 17:12.354
Sheep?!

17:12.388 --> 17:14.190
Who gave you permission
to bring in a herd of sheep?!

17:14.257 --> 17:15.558
Uh, technically speaking,

17:15.593 --> 17:17.358
it's a flock, flock of sheep.

17:17.394 --> 17:19.694
Do I care? I'm a cattle man.

17:19.729 --> 17:21.429
There's never been sheep
on this ranch

17:21.464 --> 17:23.031
- and there never will be!
- Okay, grandpa.

17:23.098 --> 17:26.201
Well, there's big money
in sheep, Jack.

17:26.234 --> 17:28.604
I'm telling you, organic lamb,
it's all the rage.

17:28.638 --> 17:31.006
<i>Bigger than bison.</i>

17:31.040 --> 17:33.675
<i>Besides, I did it for you.</i>

17:33.743 --> 17:35.643
Face it, your days of riding
the range are over.

17:35.711 --> 17:37.277
What does that mean, "over"?

17:37.345 --> 17:38.913
That's not true, grandpa.

17:38.947 --> 17:39.747
That's not what dad means.

17:42.084 --> 17:44.384
And the beauty of sheep

17:44.419 --> 17:46.386
<i>is they can be controlled</i>
<i>by a dog,</i>

17:46.421 --> 17:48.188
<i>and they threw the dog in</i>
<i>with the package.</i>

17:48.256 --> 17:49.657
Get rid of 'em.

17:49.725 --> 17:51.391
Put your flock of sheep

17:51.459 --> 17:53.493
right back onto that trailer.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.595
Not gonna happen. Bought
'em with my own funds.

17:55.663 --> 17:57.063
They're stayin'.

17:57.131 --> 17:58.932
Over my dead body!

17:59.000 --> 17:59.499
Almost was!

18:01.969 --> 18:03.236
What?

18:03.270 --> 18:04.237
Too soon?

18:07.774 --> 18:08.507
I think we need
to make a toast.

18:09.609 --> 18:12.077
To Jack! Welcome home.

18:12.145 --> 18:13.278
Grandpa, welcome home.

18:13.346 --> 18:14.346
It's good to have you back.

18:14.380 --> 18:16.682
Mmm...

18:16.750 --> 18:18.751
And just so you know,
despite today's little hiccup,

18:18.818 --> 18:20.585
everything has been running
like clockwork

18:20.654 --> 18:22.254
since you've been away.
Right, guys?

18:22.321 --> 18:23.921
It has. Yeah.

18:23.956 --> 18:25.422
<i>Well, I have to admit</i>

18:25.457 --> 18:29.493
I was a little worried about
how things would go without me.

18:29.561 --> 18:30.762
I'm glad it all worked out.

18:30.829 --> 18:32.063
Mmm-hmm.

18:32.097 --> 18:33.665
But I'm home now,

18:33.732 --> 18:36.067
so let's just get back
to normal.

18:36.135 --> 18:37.802
Great. Can't wait
to get back to normal.

18:37.870 --> 18:39.370
This place was a-

18:39.437 --> 18:40.403
<i>You know, we made
a lot of progress,</i>

18:40.437 --> 18:42.839
I think, while you were gone.

18:42.874 --> 18:45.676
Sometimes seeing things
through fresh eyes

18:45.743 --> 18:47.744
is the ticket, huh?

18:47.779 --> 18:49.279
<i>And as for the future, Jack,</i>

18:49.313 --> 18:50.147
<i>you don't have a thing</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

18:50.214 --> 18:51.381
<i>I'm not goin' anywhere.</i>

18:51.448 --> 18:53.083
I'm not selling big river.

18:53.151 --> 18:54.918
<i>But even with you back,</i>

18:54.952 --> 18:56.485
<i>I'll continue to run</i>
<i>the day-to-day.</i>

18:56.553 --> 18:57.486
Did everyone have
enough to eat?

18:57.554 --> 18:58.888
Anyone want dessert?

18:58.922 --> 19:00.255
Yeah? Yeah.

19:00.323 --> 19:01.390
We got this, grandpa,

19:01.424 --> 19:02.792
you don't move a muscle, okay?

19:02.826 --> 19:04.259
Where are you going?

19:04.294 --> 19:06.862
Oh, I just need a little air.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.898
Okay, well, put on your jacket.
Don't catch a chill.

19:15.838 --> 19:17.605
So how you been?
You're lookin' good.

19:20.609 --> 19:21.275
<i>Hey, grandpa?</i>

19:23.813 --> 19:26.447
Lou... she worries.

19:26.481 --> 19:28.849
Yeah.

19:28.883 --> 19:30.918
You know,
I missed you so much.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.385
I'm so glad you're back.

19:37.458 --> 19:39.727
So how's work goin', Amy?
You keepin' busy?

19:39.761 --> 19:41.128
It's okay. Yeah?

19:41.162 --> 19:43.163
It's a little slow.

19:43.198 --> 19:44.163
Yeah, well, by the
looks of that board

19:44.198 --> 19:48.034
it's been more than slow

19:48.068 --> 19:50.036
and I feel kinda responsible
for that.

19:50.070 --> 19:52.438
I know my health situation

19:52.472 --> 19:55.174
took everybody out
of their normal routine.

19:55.209 --> 19:56.776
A week in the hospital,

19:56.810 --> 19:58.978
two months of being
waited on at home,

19:59.012 --> 20:03.701
- yeah, that's a long time.
- Grandpa, nobody minded waiting on you.

20:04.483 --> 20:06.718
You've looked after us
all our lives.

20:06.753 --> 20:09.020
Well, that's fine.

20:09.055 --> 20:10.555
I was hoping you'd have
gotten back into it

20:10.589 --> 20:12.523
while I was in Arizona.

20:12.591 --> 20:15.460
Did you happen to talk
to those folks in Vegas

20:15.494 --> 20:17.728
about rescheduling
that clinic you missed?

20:17.796 --> 20:19.663
No. I needed to be here.

20:23.101 --> 20:26.971
Don't worry about me, okay?
Everything'll be fine.

20:27.005 --> 20:27.772
I'm just glad you're better.

20:29.507 --> 20:30.707
I love you.

20:47.557 --> 20:49.591
I did a search on you!

20:49.625 --> 20:51.626
No wonder that guy wanted you
to work with emir.

20:51.661 --> 20:54.830
You used to be
the "miracle girl".

20:54.864 --> 20:55.998
I've never heard anyone
call you that!

20:59.602 --> 21:03.371
<i>I used to be the "miracle girl?"</i>
<i>that pretty much sums it up, doesn't it?</i>

21:04.139 --> 21:05.973
<i>Miracle girl, eh? I remember that.</i>

21:06.041 --> 21:08.309
Ty, come on, I'm being serious here!
Okay, okay!

21:08.376 --> 21:10.978
All I'm saying is
don't beat yourself up, okay?

21:11.046 --> 21:12.346
<i>You're not into it right now.</i>

21:12.414 --> 21:14.115
You can't force it.

21:14.183 --> 21:15.249
I just... I feel like a...

21:16.952 --> 21:19.120
What?

21:19.188 --> 21:21.421
So what if this Ahmed guy's
a prince?!

21:21.488 --> 21:23.556
The bottom line is
his horse needs help,

21:23.624 --> 21:25.926
and I let him
totally intimidate me!

21:25.960 --> 21:26.927
<i>I should've</i>
<i>just stood my ground and-</i>

21:26.961 --> 21:29.495
hey, come here.

21:29.563 --> 21:31.497
I just-come here. Listen.

21:31.565 --> 21:34.201
You still can.

21:34.268 --> 21:35.668
It's like you said,
he's just a prince.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.642
That's it...
Bring him around. Good.

21:50.317 --> 21:52.583
Whoa! Easy, easy!
Come on!

21:52.651 --> 21:54.418
Come on! Go!

21:54.486 --> 21:56.420
Stop it! Stop!

21:56.455 --> 21:58.422
- Come on.
- That won't work!

21:58.457 --> 22:00.758
<i>Back off, Jamie.
Back off.</i>

22:00.826 --> 22:03.361
It's okay. I know, I know.
Good boy.

22:05.530 --> 22:06.731
Do you all want to get fired?!
Is that it?!

22:09.600 --> 22:11.101
Sir! Captain, sir!

22:11.169 --> 22:13.803
<i>Oh, oh, careful!</i>

22:15.173 --> 22:17.875
Agh! Agh!

22:17.909 --> 22:20.727
Pack that animal up
and get him out of my sight!

22:23.481 --> 22:25.487
- You okay?

22:31.925 --> 22:34.860
You see, grandpa,
they're not so bad, right?

22:34.895 --> 22:37.196
Not so bad
if they're off my property.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.230
There's no place for 'em here.

22:38.264 --> 22:39.531
Okay, hear me out.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.099
I got a perfect place
for a pen.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.068
No, dad, we can
talk about that later.

22:43.102 --> 22:45.837
We don't need a new pen
if there's nothin' to go in it.

22:45.902 --> 22:47.636
You get 'em outta here pronto!

22:51.644 --> 22:53.778
One, make these sheep
disappear,

22:53.813 --> 22:57.948
and two, you are not getting rid
of grandpa's trucks!

22:57.983 --> 22:58.849
I already made the deal
with stumpy to tow them away.

22:58.883 --> 23:01.418
Why should I?

23:01.452 --> 23:04.354
Because grandpa will lose
it and I will lose it!

23:04.388 --> 23:05.723
Please, dad, cancel.

23:07.726 --> 23:09.059
- Okay.
- I mean it.

23:09.094 --> 23:09.593
Okay!

23:14.464 --> 23:17.266
So thanks for the call
and don't worry about a thing.

23:17.334 --> 23:19.969
I know the guys at the airport,
the paperwork will go smoothly.

23:20.037 --> 23:21.804
Thanks, I appreciate it.

23:21.839 --> 23:23.405
Take care of yourself,
all right?

23:23.440 --> 23:26.143
Ah, it's not the first time I've
been kicked by a horse, or the last.

23:28.311 --> 23:29.911
<i>Hey, good to see you again.</i>

23:29.946 --> 23:31.880
Just so you know,
your horses from Belgium?

23:31.914 --> 23:33.615
Ty and I will be
at the airport personally

23:33.650 --> 23:36.184
to make sure that
the de-planing goes well,

23:36.218 --> 23:38.319
and we're honoured that
you would have us involved.

23:38.354 --> 23:39.855
You were never involved.

23:39.889 --> 23:41.589
I have my own people
to oversee it.

23:41.658 --> 23:42.858
I hardly need
a small-town cow doctor.

23:42.925 --> 23:45.259
Whoa, whoa.

23:45.326 --> 23:47.261
<i>We were actually asked</i>
<i>to help out.</i>

23:47.328 --> 23:48.228
Really.

23:48.263 --> 23:48.763
Yeah.

23:51.733 --> 23:55.002
Your arm, it's broken.

23:55.070 --> 23:57.237
So you not only went behind
my back with this arrangement,

23:57.305 --> 23:58.873
you are now completely incapable
of managing the horses

23:58.940 --> 24:00.874
in that condition.

24:00.941 --> 24:03.943
How are you of any use to me?
You're fired.

24:03.978 --> 24:06.012
I should have done it
a long time ago.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.246
And what is with you people

24:07.314 --> 24:08.381
that you're constantly
poking your noses

24:08.415 --> 24:09.649
where they don't belong?

24:09.717 --> 24:11.517
You are not welcome here!

24:11.585 --> 24:13.252
And that annoying
country bumpkin cowgirl

24:13.320 --> 24:14.721
who keeps showing up,

24:14.789 --> 24:15.454
I don't want to see her
back here either!

24:20.393 --> 24:21.827
Hey, hold on a second!

24:21.895 --> 24:23.228
You got a problem, man?!

24:23.296 --> 24:25.363
Are you afraid to talk to Amy?

24:25.431 --> 24:27.833
You have no idea
what she is capable of!

24:27.901 --> 24:29.134
You could have
your world class horse back

24:29.202 --> 24:29.902
and you're throwing it away.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.770
World class?

24:31.838 --> 24:33.137
Emir is far from being
world class.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.906
Never was and never will be!

24:34.940 --> 24:36.540
In fact, that horse has let me

24:36.608 --> 24:38.843
and my team down consistently.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.651
Sorry, Adrian.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.586
Let us know if there's anything
we can do to help.

24:49.653 --> 24:51.855
Take emir back to heartland.

24:51.889 --> 24:54.191
I want Amy to work with him.

24:54.258 --> 24:57.027
What about the...?

24:57.061 --> 24:59.562
I'll take responsibility.

24:59.597 --> 25:03.233
I'll take full responsibility.

25:03.267 --> 25:05.567
Hey, Katie, do you want some?
You want some pasta?

25:08.304 --> 25:11.006
Now this...
This is what I missed the most!

25:11.041 --> 25:12.908
Hello.

25:12.976 --> 25:15.377
You were missing
something else too?

25:15.445 --> 25:16.011
<i>Look at that!
You found it!</i>

25:18.982 --> 25:20.216
<i>Hey, so I just
talked to Peter</i>

25:20.250 --> 25:22.117
and he's headed home,

25:22.151 --> 25:24.219
and he has no plans
this weekend.

25:24.286 --> 25:26.955
So if you wanted to ask him
that question -

25:26.989 --> 25:30.058
you know, that thing
that we talked about?

25:33.495 --> 25:35.730
What's goin' on there?

25:35.765 --> 25:37.564
Uh, it's nothing.
It'll all work itself out.

25:37.598 --> 25:39.332
Here you go.

25:39.367 --> 25:40.801
You know, you finish your lunch
with grandpa, okay?

25:40.835 --> 25:42.669
Nothing to worry about.

25:42.703 --> 25:46.439
Lou, I don't mind
worrying about somethin'.

25:46.474 --> 25:49.276
It's not gonna kill me, is it?

25:49.310 --> 25:51.745
See now,
there's a noodle for you.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.345
Ah, too late, noodle for me.

25:55.149 --> 25:57.850
Hey! What's he doin' here?

25:57.885 --> 25:59.152
How did you convince
his highness

25:59.186 --> 26:00.686
to let me work with him.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.254
We didn't.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.301
Hey, Peter!

26:19.038 --> 26:20.538
Hey.

26:20.572 --> 26:21.907
I'm so glad you're home!

26:23.709 --> 26:24.475
Wow.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.446
It's just beautiful
how he moves.

26:29.514 --> 26:31.148
He's amazing to watch.

26:31.216 --> 26:32.382
<i>He is a champion.</i>

26:32.450 --> 26:33.583
<i>I trained emir</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

26:33.651 --> 26:36.520
<i>He won competition</i>
<i>after competition.</i>

26:36.587 --> 26:39.456
Well, Ahmed said he
wasn't performing too well.

26:39.524 --> 26:40.691
Emir was a star

26:40.758 --> 26:43.159
when he belonged
to Ahmed's father.

26:43.194 --> 26:44.861
So he wasn't always his horse?

26:44.895 --> 26:47.230
<i>No, not at all.</i>

26:47.264 --> 26:49.265
About a year ago,
just before his death,

26:49.300 --> 26:52.468
the king gave emir to his son
as a gift.

26:52.502 --> 26:54.170
Just like that
his winning streak was over.

27:01.744 --> 27:02.577
I will have you arrested
for horse theft -

27:02.611 --> 27:04.179
all of you!

27:04.247 --> 27:06.748
Have you completely lost
your mind, Adrian?!

27:06.782 --> 27:08.583
I was doin' what your
father would've wanted me to do.

27:13.288 --> 27:15.156
- Uh, no!
- Give her to me!

27:15.224 --> 27:16.623
Hey. Hey! Hey!

27:17.893 --> 27:19.293
<i>It's okay, it's okay!</i>

27:19.328 --> 27:20.461
Whoa. Easy. It's okay.

27:23.531 --> 27:25.199
Why are you so afraid of him?

27:27.035 --> 27:28.669
I'm not afraid of anything.

27:28.737 --> 27:29.402
If you think
I am afraid of an animal,

27:29.436 --> 27:31.104
you're wrong!

27:31.172 --> 27:33.539
Okay, then work with him.

27:33.607 --> 27:35.876
Why? I don't have to prove
anything to you.

27:35.943 --> 27:37.643
No, you don't,

27:37.711 --> 27:39.746
but why don't you prove it
to yourself?

27:45.818 --> 27:47.152
Come on! Come on!

27:55.695 --> 27:56.561
I've had enough!

27:58.865 --> 28:01.632
I won't do
a stable hand's job!

28:01.700 --> 28:03.968
Listen, you can't give up!

28:04.003 --> 28:06.938
There's a reason emir acts
that way with you.

28:06.972 --> 28:08.339
Really? And you
have the answer, do you?

28:08.407 --> 28:09.573
Yeah.

28:09.641 --> 28:11.409
Oh! Then, please, enlighten me.

28:11.443 --> 28:12.944
The reason he acts
this way with you

28:12.978 --> 28:15.213
is because the only attachment
he has is negative!

28:15.281 --> 28:17.747
A negative attachment.
I love it.

28:17.782 --> 28:19.582
He associates you
with that horrible flight.

28:19.617 --> 28:21.084
It terrified him!

28:21.152 --> 28:22.319
And you're just a silly
country girl

28:22.387 --> 28:23.720
spouting new age garbage!

28:23.754 --> 28:25.755
I am a professional.

28:25.790 --> 28:27.057
Why do you think Adrian
called me in the first place?

28:27.091 --> 28:29.226
Because Adrian is a fool.

28:29.294 --> 28:31.628
And you are a spoiled,
condescending, sexist idiot!

28:31.662 --> 28:33.029
How dare you?!

28:33.063 --> 28:34.663
You don't know
anything about me!

28:34.697 --> 28:36.299
I know you have no personal
connection with that horse!

28:36.333 --> 28:37.833
Personal connection?

28:37.901 --> 28:38.935
Brushing him, grooming him,

28:38.969 --> 28:40.036
being with him?!

28:40.070 --> 28:41.304
I have staff to do that.

28:41.338 --> 28:44.407
And so did your father,

28:44.441 --> 28:48.110
but I can bet
he did it himself anyway.

28:48.145 --> 28:50.545
Emir was his horse.

28:50.579 --> 28:52.080
They won championships
together,

28:52.114 --> 28:54.849
so they must have
had a strong bond.

28:54.883 --> 28:57.118
He misses him.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.754
He doesn't have that connection
with anyone anymore,

28:59.788 --> 29:00.888
certainly not with you.

29:08.964 --> 29:12.833
I'm sorry, I...
I shouldn't have said that.

29:12.867 --> 29:14.969
I'm probably totally wrong.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.337
You're not wrong.

29:19.807 --> 29:22.475
How do you think it feels,
losing again and again

29:22.509 --> 29:25.511
on a horse that my father
made a champion of?

29:29.716 --> 29:32.918
My father was the founder
of the equestrian team.

29:32.987 --> 29:35.554
Everyone loved him,

29:35.589 --> 29:37.055
and I'm letting
his memory down

29:37.090 --> 29:39.691
in front of my teammates.

29:39.725 --> 29:43.228
They know it's not the horse.

29:43.296 --> 29:46.664
Well, then you need emir
to trust you,

29:46.732 --> 29:48.933
like he trusted your father.

29:49.002 --> 29:50.568
I am not my father.

29:54.106 --> 29:56.240
I can't come close
to being my father.

29:56.308 --> 29:59.010
And I'm not asking you to,

29:59.077 --> 30:02.480
but you can still reach emir.

30:02.547 --> 30:04.248
I can't imagine competing
at such a high level

30:04.316 --> 30:05.149
without a partnership.

30:07.585 --> 30:11.354
You need to make
a personal connection with him

30:11.422 --> 30:12.622
and I want to help you.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.791
Will you let me?

30:30.792 --> 30:32.492
Good to be home.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.261
Glad you are.

30:34.329 --> 30:37.164
Well, thank you. Good.

30:37.232 --> 30:38.364
Hey, there's this
rumour going around

30:38.432 --> 30:41.467
about some dance or something.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.536
Do you know anything
about that?

30:45.405 --> 30:46.840
I'm guessing
from that reaction

30:46.907 --> 30:48.007
that you don't want to go.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.136
Is that right?

30:50.049 --> 30:52.104
Obviously.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.105
How come?

30:58.584 --> 31:00.118
I don't know.

31:00.186 --> 31:04.022
- It might be fun.
- It might not be too.

31:04.090 --> 31:06.124
Well, that's true,
it might not be.

31:07.927 --> 31:10.361
Come on, Georgie, why not?

31:12.297 --> 31:13.831
Well, it's just...

31:14.341 --> 31:15.873
It's just...

31:16.568 --> 31:18.069
I've never been
to a dance before

31:18.136 --> 31:19.937
and I don't want to make
a fool out of myself

31:19.972 --> 31:22.139
in front of everybody,

31:22.174 --> 31:24.141
especially Olivia.

31:24.176 --> 31:28.278
Okay, but...

31:28.312 --> 31:29.846
I mean, if you don't go

31:29.914 --> 31:32.448
isn't that kind of like
letting Olivia win?

31:32.483 --> 31:35.118
She probably doesn't want you
to come anyway, right?

31:35.152 --> 31:37.020
I'm sure she would just love
to be there

31:37.054 --> 31:39.837
all by herself
holding court all her own.

31:43.793 --> 31:45.294
Well, think about it,

31:45.328 --> 31:46.262
because if you do need
someone to go with

31:46.296 --> 31:47.662
I have a brand new suit

31:47.697 --> 31:50.299
that's just dying
to be shown off, okay?

32:02.778 --> 32:04.078
This is ridiculous!

32:05.915 --> 32:07.882
Just keep trying.

32:07.917 --> 32:09.817
Look at
him, he hates me!

32:09.851 --> 32:12.020
O-okay...

32:12.054 --> 32:13.621
Why don't you take
the lunge line off him?

32:19.427 --> 32:20.193
<i>Send him around again.</i>

32:24.198 --> 32:25.698
It's no use!

32:25.766 --> 32:28.501
Just talk to
him, be steady.

32:28.536 --> 32:29.602
He needs to see you
as his safe place.

32:32.806 --> 32:34.173
Okay, now keep him moving.

32:37.377 --> 32:37.977
I'm sorry!

32:41.681 --> 32:42.681
I'm sorry I'm not my father.

32:45.919 --> 32:47.152
Try changing direction.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.354
Heyah!

32:51.290 --> 32:52.958
Okay, now steady, turn in.

32:58.664 --> 32:59.965
That's good.
Change direction again.

33:03.568 --> 33:05.702
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>Now talk to him quietly.</i>

33:05.736 --> 33:06.703
Good boy.

33:09.374 --> 33:10.574
<i>Okay, now stop and
turn away from him.</i>

33:15.113 --> 33:16.313
<i>Now walk away.</i>

33:45.608 --> 33:46.975
I miss him too, you know.

34:07.661 --> 34:10.030
Boy, that tack looks
pretty nice and clean.

34:10.097 --> 34:11.197
I did that.

34:11.232 --> 34:13.166
Did you now?
Well, good work.

34:16.737 --> 34:19.205
What are you doing?
You can't ride! You might...

34:19.239 --> 34:20.139
I might what?

34:22.242 --> 34:23.975
I'm not a delicate flower,
Georgie.

34:24.010 --> 34:26.678
Sittin' in a saddle
is not a problem.

34:26.712 --> 34:28.414
Don't get all worried
on me now.

34:28.447 --> 34:29.915
But I am worried!

34:29.949 --> 34:31.382
Everyone is

34:31.418 --> 34:33.652
and they're all acting
like big fakes!

34:33.686 --> 34:35.187
Like it was all fine
when you were gone,

34:35.221 --> 34:37.722
but it wasn't!

34:37.757 --> 34:39.090
It was weird and horrible

34:39.123 --> 34:42.159
because Tim was here
and you weren't,

34:42.194 --> 34:46.797
and I was scared, Jack.
I'm still scared.

34:46.831 --> 34:48.466
Ah, don't be scared.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.568
I'm not goin' anywhere soon.

34:52.237 --> 34:52.937
Sorry.

34:55.273 --> 34:58.408
I'm probably gonna
get you sick again.

34:58.443 --> 35:00.711
Lou says I shouldn't
stress you out.

35:00.745 --> 35:02.947
Oh, you're not
stressin' me out.

35:02.981 --> 35:06.516
I'd rather everyone
be straight with me anyway.

35:06.551 --> 35:09.853
<i>You know,</i>
<i>it wasn't all that bad.</i>

35:09.888 --> 35:12.288
In fact, the whole experience

35:12.322 --> 35:15.592
opened my eyes
to a couple of things.

35:15.626 --> 35:17.259
You never want to pass up
an opportunity

35:17.294 --> 35:19.028
to be close to your family,

35:19.063 --> 35:21.530
and never give up
without a fight.

35:28.738 --> 35:30.906
So I'm glad to hear

35:30.940 --> 35:32.407
you're back workin' again
with that prince.

35:32.475 --> 35:33.541
Yeah, I guess.

35:33.576 --> 35:34.977
Oh, that's good, Amy.

35:35.011 --> 35:36.612
Yeah, I told her that.

35:36.679 --> 35:38.814
<i>Yup, it's a great opportunity.</i>

35:38.881 --> 35:40.649
Okay, I have an announcement
to make.

35:43.418 --> 35:46.621
I've made a decision
about the dance.

35:46.655 --> 35:48.756
I'd like to go
if you would go with me.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.594
Well, thank you very much.
I would love to.

35:53.662 --> 35:55.229
Honey, that's great!

35:55.263 --> 35:56.931
What made you change
your mind?

35:56.965 --> 35:58.065
Just leave it alone, honey.
Okay.

36:00.635 --> 36:02.368
So, coffee anyone?

36:02.436 --> 36:02.902
Yeah.

36:06.273 --> 36:07.573
Okay, want some?

36:07.608 --> 36:08.108
<i>Sure.</i>

36:23.423 --> 36:23.956
<i>Well, Peter, you
get to use your new suit.</i>

36:23.990 --> 36:25.158
Tim?

36:25.225 --> 36:27.326
Yeah?

36:27.394 --> 36:29.529
Can I have
a word with you?

36:29.596 --> 36:30.729
Uh...

36:35.801 --> 36:37.035
How dare you take over
this ranch while I was gone?

36:37.102 --> 36:38.870
Oh, come on!

36:38.937 --> 36:40.238
How dare you buy
a herd of sheep?!

36:40.306 --> 36:41.806
Flock. Now I know-

36:41.874 --> 36:43.775
shut up, I'm talkin' here!

36:43.842 --> 36:45.009
I know everybody else,

36:45.077 --> 36:46.110
they saying
it all went smooth,

36:46.145 --> 36:48.312
but apparently,
you rode roughshod

36:48.346 --> 36:50.281
over this family
the entire time!

36:50.315 --> 36:51.715
Where do you get off
with that?!

36:51.783 --> 36:53.250
And to top everything,

36:53.285 --> 36:54.985
you threw out my coffee maker!

36:55.019 --> 36:55.886
Oh, is that what
this is about?

36:55.953 --> 36:57.388
Your coffee maker?!

36:57.422 --> 36:59.690
Don't you dare turn this
back around onto me!

36:59.724 --> 37:02.893
I'm runnin' the ranch
while you're down for the count

37:02.927 --> 37:04.694
sunnin' yourself in Arizona!

37:04.761 --> 37:06.829
Arizona was not my idea!

37:06.863 --> 37:08.130
And you're worried about

37:08.199 --> 37:10.132
some 400-year-old
coffee maker?!

37:10.201 --> 37:11.334
Oh, thanks for
the appreciation!

37:11.402 --> 37:12.802
It's not just about
a coffee maker, Tim,

37:12.869 --> 37:15.371
it's about the way
you treat me!

37:15.406 --> 37:19.208
I am not redundant.
I am not sick.

37:19.275 --> 37:21.276
Don't you dare
put me out to pasture.

37:21.311 --> 37:23.011
You don't need
to "be here" for me,

37:23.045 --> 37:24.879
because I'm here!

37:24.947 --> 37:27.781
I'm the reason you are here!

37:27.849 --> 37:29.049
I'm the one that found ya
face down in the snow!

37:29.117 --> 37:30.585
Oh, here we go again.

37:30.652 --> 37:32.119
If it wasn't for
me-I saved your life!

37:32.187 --> 37:34.689
Oh, so you called 911.
Big deal!

37:34.756 --> 37:36.023
Anybody that came along
woulda done the same-

37:36.057 --> 37:37.258
but they didn't! They didn't!

37:37.292 --> 37:39.193
It was me! I'm the one.

37:39.228 --> 37:41.262
I saved your life!
I saved your life!

37:41.296 --> 37:43.597
All right, fine!

37:43.631 --> 37:45.265
But you, you're the one
who almost killed me

37:45.333 --> 37:46.700
in the first place!

37:51.772 --> 37:53.640
You're right,
I guess I kinda did.

38:04.851 --> 38:06.218
Good to have you back, buddy.

38:23.439 --> 38:25.507
<i>We're going to do this.</i>

38:25.541 --> 38:26.174
Okay, boy.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.757
Will you consider returning
to your job?

39:29.568 --> 39:31.102
Good boy.

39:47.752 --> 39:48.885
Hey!

39:48.920 --> 39:49.986
Hello.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.224
I, uh, I should have called,
but-

39:54.291 --> 39:55.357
No, that's fine.

39:59.395 --> 40:01.864
I just wanted to thank you
for all you did,

40:01.898 --> 40:02.732
and I wanted to let you know,

40:02.799 --> 40:04.299
at Adrian's urging,

40:04.367 --> 40:07.036
I watched
the "miracle girl" video.

40:07.070 --> 40:08.604
Quite astonishing.

40:08.638 --> 40:10.172
Thank you.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.506
So...

40:12.541 --> 40:13.808
I thought
this was appropriate.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.307
Oh!

40:23.786 --> 40:27.287
<i>It's beautiful! I, I...</i>

40:27.321 --> 40:28.555
I can't accept that!

40:28.589 --> 40:31.091
Yes, you can.

40:31.159 --> 40:32.192
It's very bad form
to turn down a gift

40:32.227 --> 40:33.560
from a prince.

40:35.363 --> 40:37.430
Thank you.

40:37.465 --> 40:40.901
I... do I curtsy
or can I give you a hug?

40:40.969 --> 40:42.702
I will allow the hug.

40:42.737 --> 40:44.270
Thank you.
Thank you so much!

40:48.008 --> 40:50.042
I hope to see you at the show.

40:50.077 --> 40:52.378
We'll be there.

40:52.412 --> 40:53.379
Thank you.

41:08.527 --> 41:10.028
Welcome back, miracle girl.

41:10.062 --> 41:10.929
Thanks.

41:15.566 --> 41:17.034
<i>What?! No! Dad,
you promised me!</i>

41:22.007 --> 41:23.674
Oh my God!

41:26.744 --> 41:28.445
Grandpa, you are back!

41:28.479 --> 41:30.247
You know, you were gone
a long time!

41:30.282 --> 41:33.416
I'm fine, Lou,
please stop worrying.

41:33.450 --> 41:35.852
No, no, no, don't worry.
Let me take these bags.

41:35.886 --> 41:38.054
Did you go to the bakery?
No, you didn't.

41:38.088 --> 41:40.123
They have these
new apple fritters

41:40.157 --> 41:41.858
that are to die for.

41:41.892 --> 41:42.792
I'm gonna pick you up some,
okay?

41:42.827 --> 41:43.592
You're gonna love them.

41:58.441 --> 41:59.141
