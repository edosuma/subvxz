02:43.931 --> 02:46.831
Maybe we should check out
this Pizza Pan Theatre.

Yeah, it just might
lead us to another

Someone bricked up
the tunnel.

04:28.735 --> 04:32.103

Hey, great name,

the entrance to our lair.

Guys, if it keeps
rising at this rate,

into an indoor swimming pool.

I'll bet that
phantom character

05:11.511 --> 05:13.044

to do with this.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.747
But why would the dude
be flooding the sewers?

05:15.749 --> 05:17.882
Well, maybe he sells
scuba gear part-time.

the river's flooding.

He's opened
the flood control
valves.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.565

He's using the force
of the water

05:34.567 --> 05:36.467

hydroelectric power.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.169
We'll have to find
the control wheels

05:38.171 --> 05:40.004

those floodgates.

don't look now,

but I think
the rest of your life
just arrived!

07:12.631 --> 07:15.300

It's an underground
waterfall!

come from anyway?

07:34.387 --> 07:36.955
There are no
major waterfalls
beneath the city.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.256
It came from there.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.257
When the phantom opened
those floodgates

07:40.259 --> 07:41.892
for his hydroelectric
power,

07:41.894 --> 07:44.161
he created
a giant waterfall.

07:44.163 --> 07:47.799
Guys, look,
the floodgate controls.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.567

Well, don't
just stand there,

07:49.569 --> 07:52.469

turned into a fish tank!

tries to open them again.

[grunting]

08:17.597 --> 08:19.463
There.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.599
Now the phantom won't
be able to carry out

08:21.601 --> 08:25.569
his horrible, evil,
terrible plans.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.439
Hey, just what the heck
are his plans anyway?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.507

have to find out.

of a building.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.022
Yeah, but what building?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.057
Hey,

08:46.059 --> 08:49.193

like an elevator shaft.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.530
And this almost looks
like an elevator platform.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.833

like an elevator control.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.169

Well, if there isn't,

11:23.149 --> 11:24.515
we've been chasing
a sewer worker

11:24.517 --> 11:26.317
who's got a thing
for black capes.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.452
I haven't even had a chance
to investigate it

11:28.454 --> 11:30.854
because of all those
bank robberies last night.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.557
Uh, what bank
robberies?
Didn't you hear?

11:33.559 --> 11:36.827
40 different banks,
all over the city
were broken into

11:36.829 --> 11:39.663
by thieves who ripped
the vault doors
off their hinges.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.965
One robbery like that
would be baffling enough,

11:41.967 --> 11:43.100
but 40?

11:43.102 --> 11:46.069
Let's hit the streets
and check it out.

11:50.275 --> 11:51.675
[Raphael]
"Cityville Bank.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.744
Our vaults
have no faults."

11:53.746 --> 11:55.912
[scoffs]
How corny.
Who cares?

11:55.914 --> 11:58.116
It's one of the few banks
that hasn't been robbed yet.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.884
Now be on guard, fellas.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.786
If those robber dudes
are strong enough

12:01.788 --> 12:03.921
to rip the door
off a bank vault,

12:03.923 --> 12:06.490
just imagine what they
could do to our shells.

12:06.492 --> 12:09.160
Ooh, thanks for bringing
that up, Michelangelo.

12:10.295 --> 12:12.396
Uh-oh, here they
come now.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.599
They've got to be
incredibly huge,

12:15.601 --> 12:17.268
brutally strong,

12:17.270 --> 12:19.370
savagely evil.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.674
[Donatello]
The robots from
the Pizza Pan Theatre?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.242
They're the robbers?

12:25.244 --> 12:26.410
They got to be kiddin'.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.251
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

12:35.754 --> 12:38.723
Maybe we underestimated
these guys.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.991
What a humiliating way to go--

12:40.993 --> 12:43.894
done in by a bunch
of cutesy-poo critters!

12:43.896 --> 12:46.663
I can't believe
I'm about to be
blown to bits

12:46.665 --> 12:48.399
by a wombat!

12:48.401 --> 12:50.001
Aw, no way!

12:50.003 --> 12:52.736
Let's take 'em,
green team!

12:59.278 --> 13:01.278
Ugh!

13:01.280 --> 13:02.747
Adorable and lethal.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.749
Now, that's what I call
a deadly combination.

13:06.518 --> 13:07.751
Uh-oh.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.925
Thought you'd
never get here.

13:18.897 --> 13:20.197
[clanging]

13:20.199 --> 13:21.565
Oof!

13:24.369 --> 13:26.604
Oh, these things
are too strong.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.273
We need some heavier
artillery, guys.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.942
Got just the thing,
muchacho!

13:34.746 --> 13:37.347
I'm taking it
to the streets!

13:45.156 --> 13:47.224
Way to go, Michelangelo!

13:47.226 --> 13:49.393
They crumbled like
animal crackers!

13:49.395 --> 13:52.029
We did it!
The bank is safe.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.165
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

13:56.401 --> 13:57.935
And look there!

13:57.937 --> 14:00.738
[Raphael]
Not more adorable
law-breakers!

14:05.244 --> 14:09.012
Someone's turned
all those Pizza Pan Theatre
robots loose.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.549
It must be the same someone
who's controlling them.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.717
<i>[TurtleCom beeping]</i>
But who?

14:12.719 --> 14:14.051
<i>Guys, it's April.</i>

14:14.053 --> 14:15.152
<i>Wait</i>
<i>till you hear this.</i>

14:15.154 --> 14:16.854
And wait till you hear this.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.889
The crooks who robbed
all those banks

14:18.891 --> 14:21.559
are the robots
from the Pizza Pan Theatre.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.327
<i>Then you'll be</i>
<i>interested in this.</i>

14:23.329 --> 14:27.131
<i>Rufus Higby</i>
<i>originally had a partner</i>
<i>in the Pizza Pan Theatre.</i>

14:27.133 --> 14:29.400
<i>His name was Bogart Flywheel.</i>

14:29.402 --> 14:31.502
<i>He designed all the robots</i>
<i>for the theater.</i>

14:31.504 --> 14:34.372
<i>But he had a falling out</i>
<i>with Higby three months ago,</i>

14:34.374 --> 14:36.340
<i>and vanished</i>
<i>without a trace.</i>

14:36.342 --> 14:39.710
Then this Flywheel guy
might be the phantom.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.845
And he's trying
to scare away
all the customers

14:41.847 --> 14:43.080
to get even with Higby.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.983
And if he designed
all the robots,

14:45.985 --> 14:49.453
he must also be the one
behind the bank break-ins.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.821
To the sewers!

14:50.823 --> 14:52.456
We've got to stop
that dapper

14:52.458 --> 14:55.059
yet demented dude.

15:00.465 --> 15:03.467
[transmitter beeping]

15:03.469 --> 15:04.769
He's in there, all right.

15:04.771 --> 15:08.205
But we don't want
his booby traps
to get us this time.

15:08.207 --> 15:09.907
Hang on, amigos.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.748
[all]
Turtle Power!

15:19.117 --> 15:21.018
All right,
phantom, drop that...

15:23.421 --> 15:26.090
lavishly illustrated
magazine.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.092
Uh, how can you read
while you're running

15:28.094 --> 15:29.760
the biggest crime wave
in the city?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.496
Crime wave?
What are you talking about?

15:32.498 --> 15:34.798
Oh, well, aren't you
Bogart Flywheel?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.633
And didn't you
design Willie Wombat

15:36.635 --> 15:38.336
and all those
other robots?

15:38.338 --> 15:40.137
That is correct.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.574
Well, what are you doing
lurking around in the sewers?

15:43.576 --> 15:46.243
When Rufus Higby cut me
out of our partnership,

15:46.245 --> 15:48.345
he paid a visit
to my laboratory.

15:48.347 --> 15:51.748
I feel a flashback
coming on.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.485
[Raphael]
Yeah, I was right.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.687
[Phantom]
When I refused to end
our partnership,

15:56.689 --> 15:58.188
he attacked me.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.824
I was stronger than Higby,
and able to resist.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.526
So he threw
some chemical at me.

16:06.264 --> 16:09.467
My face was horribly
disfigured,

16:09.469 --> 16:12.703
so I put on this mask
and retreated to the sewers

16:12.705 --> 16:16.474
to hide from humanity
forever.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.442
Oh, yeah? Then why
do you keep going up

16:18.444 --> 16:20.578
to the Pizza Pan Theatre
to scare folks?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.579
I don't mean
to scare anyone.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.781
But I can't help it,
looking like this.

16:24.783 --> 16:28.385
I go up to visit
my children.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.554
You mean, there's
a Mrs. Phantom?

16:30.556 --> 16:32.356
I'm talking about my robots:

16:32.358 --> 16:33.857
Willie Wombat,

16:33.859 --> 16:35.325
Elmo Elephant,

16:35.327 --> 16:37.894
Cashes Cow.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.897
You know,
I'm beginning to think

16:39.899 --> 16:43.200
that Rufus Higby
is the one behind
all these robberies.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.869
What robberies?
You must tell me.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.171
Does it involve
my precious robots?

16:47.173 --> 16:50.774
Yeah. Three of them
nearly turtle-waxed
our shells.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.010
And they've been
robbing banks
all over the city.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.879
So that's why Higby
wanted me out of the way:

16:55.881 --> 16:59.016
so he could use my inventions
for his own evil ends.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.418
I've got to stop him,

17:00.420 --> 17:02.086
and you've got to help me.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.921
[chuckles]
What a small world.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.790
You know, we were
about to ask you to help us.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.260
[Leonardo]
We figured the robots must be
operated by a remote control.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.829
[Phantom]
You were right.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.864
And in all likelihood,
it's up in the theater.

17:20.671 --> 17:22.005
No one's here.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.674
And all the robots
are gone.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.876
They must all be
out robbing banks.

17:28.046 --> 17:31.115
We've got to find
the master control
before Higby gets back.

17:32.183 --> 17:33.283
[Leonardo]
Nothing here.

17:33.285 --> 17:34.685
What about you,
Michelangelo?

17:34.687 --> 17:36.654
No luck, either,
compadre.

17:36.656 --> 17:40.357
But I did find
this really tubuloso
coffee machine.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.393
Michelangelo,
that's it!

17:43.395 --> 17:45.796
Yes, it's definitely
a remote control.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.498
Can you use it to order
the robots back here?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.733
I can try.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.902
If all goes well,
in a few moments,

17:51.904 --> 17:54.204
they'll be coming
through those doors.

17:55.406 --> 17:59.143
Good. Now all we have
to worry about is--

17:59.145 --> 18:02.278
Hey, get away
from those controls!

18:07.919 --> 18:11.088
Time to pull the plug
on this lug!

18:12.157 --> 18:13.857
[Leonardo]
Here come the robots.

18:15.527 --> 18:18.061
Ruin a perfectly good
master plan, will you?

18:18.063 --> 18:20.564
I'll get you for this!
[grunting]

18:20.566 --> 18:22.966
Whoa! Ugh!

18:22.968 --> 18:24.334
The controls
are ruined.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.169
I'm not feeling
too good myself.

18:27.772 --> 18:31.208
Whoa, those robots
are going wacko!

18:31.210 --> 18:34.144
Without the controls,
there's nothing to restrain
their actions.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.812
[Leonardo]
Look out!

18:35.814 --> 18:37.448
[springs boinging]

18:39.818 --> 18:42.285
Not so fast, bozo!

18:56.868 --> 18:59.837
[springs boinging]

18:59.839 --> 19:03.273
The robots!
Oh, they're ruined!

19:03.275 --> 19:04.808
[crying]
My children,

19:04.810 --> 19:06.944
smashed to pieces!

19:06.946 --> 19:10.047
Yeah. They sure
don't build robots
like they used to.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.849
Uh-oh. Now what?

19:11.851 --> 19:15.084
The control unit
for the robots have damaged.

19:15.086 --> 19:16.220
They're overloading.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.155
They'll explode
in a matter of minutes.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.791
If they do, they won't
just blow up the theater,

19:20.793 --> 19:23.493
they'll take out a half-mile
chunk of the city, too!

19:23.495 --> 19:25.695
We've got to keep that
from happening.

19:25.697 --> 19:26.964
But how?

19:26.966 --> 19:29.399
There just
might be a way.
Come with me.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.969
[Phantom]
These support beams are right
in the path of the floodgates.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.870
We'll open
all the floodgates.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.706
The force of the water
should be enough

19:35.708 --> 19:37.641
to knock out
the theater's
foundations.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.709
It will drop down
into the sewers,

19:39.711 --> 19:42.312
and the flood water
will squelch the explosion.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.748
Hey, great plan,

19:44.750 --> 19:47.050
but there's one
little problem.
What's that?

19:47.052 --> 19:50.254
I smashed
the floodgate controls
earlier, remember?

19:50.256 --> 19:51.822
Well, we've got
to get them fixed.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.424
All my stolen money
is hidden in the theater.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.361
I got to get it
before the whole place
blows up.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.129
Hey, guys,
we're in luck.

19:59.131 --> 20:02.099
The only thing
that's really broken
is the main control lever.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.834
Help me get
the panel open.

20:05.437 --> 20:09.006
Higby. He's escaped.
I mustn't let him get away.

20:19.717 --> 20:21.986
Aha. It's still here!

20:21.988 --> 20:24.321
[Phantom]
Higby!

20:26.090 --> 20:28.325
No, it's mine!

20:37.401 --> 20:39.403
There, it's fixed.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.005
Higby and the phantom
are gone.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.507
[Michelangelo]
I thought it felt
kind of lonely in here.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.142
Somebody's got to find them

20:45.144 --> 20:46.843
while I get
those floodgates open.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.044
We'll get 'em.

20:48.046 --> 20:51.114
Turn all those
cranks, hard!

20:56.988 --> 21:00.557
Now, Higby,
you stole my ideas,

21:00.559 --> 21:02.459
you corrupted
my inventions,

21:02.461 --> 21:05.462
and you left my face
disfigured.

21:05.464 --> 21:08.065
Hey, everybody
makes mistakes.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.133
Now you will pay.

21:10.135 --> 21:12.303
[rumbling]

21:12.305 --> 21:14.437
[both screaming]

21:16.007 --> 21:17.508
Sorry to interrupt
your fun, guys,

21:17.510 --> 21:20.077
but if we don't
get out of here
in about five seconds,

21:20.079 --> 21:21.312
we're all
gonna be toast.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.113
[both grunting]
There.

21:31.256 --> 21:32.556
[Michelangelo]
Whoa,

21:32.558 --> 21:35.192
talk about sinking
real estate values.

21:42.633 --> 21:43.867
[Leonardo]
Well, Mr. Flywheel,

21:43.869 --> 21:45.803
now that Higby's in the hands
of the police,

21:45.805 --> 21:47.170
what do you intend to do?

21:47.172 --> 21:50.007
Oh, I suppose I'll just
live out the rest of my life

21:50.009 --> 21:51.475
down here in the sewers.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.677
Oh, what Higby did
to your face, I mean,

21:53.679 --> 21:55.245
it couldn't
have been that bad.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.147
Oh, yes, it is.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.848
Look for yourself.

21:58.850 --> 22:02.252
Yuck! Mondo-hideoso.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.219
[Raphael whistling]

22:03.221 --> 22:05.222
I must admit it's,
uh, it's horrible.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.891
Wait a minute.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.226
Just as I thought.
It's paint.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.261
[all]
What?

22:11.263 --> 22:13.096
Didn't you ever try
washing your face?

22:13.098 --> 22:15.032
No. When I looked
in the mirror,

22:15.034 --> 22:17.734
I was so horrified
that I put the mask on

22:17.736 --> 22:20.304
and vowed never
to take it off again.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.173
Hey, a little soap and water,
you'll be as good as new.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.279
My friends,

22:29.281 --> 22:31.415
how can I ever
repay you?

22:31.417 --> 22:33.450
Just go back
to your old life.

22:33.452 --> 22:37.187
Yeah, and leave the sewers
to us rockin' reptiles.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.389
Ah, these sewers
sure will be quiet,

22:39.391 --> 22:40.857
now that the phantom
is gone.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.560
It'll be nice to have
some peace and quiet
around here again.

22:43.562 --> 22:45.395
[splashing]

22:46.564 --> 22:50.133
Uh, guys, why are we
ankle-deep in water again?

22:50.135 --> 22:53.336
Oh, no. I forgot
to close the floodgates!

22:53.338 --> 22:55.339
We are going to have
a very wet lair

22:55.341 --> 22:57.474
if we don't do
something fast.
Come on!

23:00.544 --> 23:03.046
Sheesh, and they chew me out

23:03.048 --> 23:05.849
when I leave the bathtub
faucet dripping.
