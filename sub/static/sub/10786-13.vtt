WEBVTT

00:01.208 --> 00:02.959
Pacey: TOMORROW NIGHT
WILL BE YOUR NIGHT.

00:02.959 --> 00:05.125
WE'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:05.125 --> 00:06.792
Joey: SOMETHING WILD,
INSANE, AND CRAZY?

00:06.792 --> 00:08.166
I PROMISE.
LIKE WHAT?

00:08.166 --> 00:09.166
LIKE I'LL COME HOME
FROM WORK EARLY

00:09.166 --> 00:12.333
AND WE'LL
WALLPAPER EACH OTHER.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.291
NO WAY.
SORRY, WE'RE DONE.

00:17.291 --> 00:18.834
WE CAN'T STOP NOW.
I DON'T KNOW THIS
STUFF AT ALL.

00:18.834 --> 00:20.083
SORRY, MASTER THESPIAN,

00:20.083 --> 00:22.500
BUT THE WHOLE NEXT PAGE
CONSISTS SOLELY

00:22.500 --> 00:23.750
OF COOING, TICKLING,
AND LAP-SITTING,

00:23.750 --> 00:26.542
3 THINGS DEFINITELY
NOT IN MY RANGE
AS AN ACTRESS.

00:26.542 --> 00:28.166
OK. LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY
TOMORROW NIGHT

00:28.166 --> 00:30.667
WHEN I GET UP
ON THAT STAGE, PANIC,

00:30.667 --> 00:34.208
DRAW A COMPLETE BLANK,
THEN JUST START AD-LIBBING
OBSCENITIES TO THE CROWD.

00:34.208 --> 00:37.917
ACTUALLY, PACEY,
I KIND OF THOUGHT
I'D GO ON SATURDAY.

00:38.875 --> 00:40.125
SATURDAY?
YEAH.

00:40.125 --> 00:43.125
NO, NO, YOU DON'T
WANT TO COME ON SATURDAY.

00:43.125 --> 00:45.000
YOU GOTTA COME ON FRIDAY.
IT'S OPENING NIGHT.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.875
MUCH BETTER CHANCE
YOU'LL GET TO WITNESS
SOME AMUSING DISASTER.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.708
YOU KNOW, LIKE SCENERY
FALLING ON MY HEAD,

00:49.708 --> 00:51.542
OR PERHAPS MY CO-STAR
HYPERVENTILATING

00:51.542 --> 00:52.917
FROM ONE OF MY
INTOXICATING STAGE KISSES.

00:52.917 --> 00:55.500
YEAH, YOU'RE
KNOWN FOR THOSE.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.083
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
FRONT ROW CENTER?

00:58.834 --> 01:00.208
I CAN'T.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.417
I KIND OF HAVE
THIS THING I HAVE
TO DO ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

01:02.417 --> 01:03.708
WHAT THING?

01:03.708 --> 01:05.708
IT'S JUST THIS THING.

01:05.708 --> 01:06.708
THIS GUY.

01:06.708 --> 01:09.375
WHAT GUY?

01:11.417 --> 01:12.875
A.J.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.208
COLLEGE GUY?

01:15.208 --> 01:17.542
HE'S COMING OUT
TO THE CAPE FOR A PARTY,

01:17.542 --> 01:19.000
AND HE INVITED
ME TO GO WITH HIM.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.041
YOU'RE GOING
TO A FRAT PARTY?

01:21.041 --> 01:22.208
HE'S NOT THAT KIND
OF A COLLEGE GUY, PACEY.

01:22.208 --> 01:25.250
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE AURORA BOREALIS?

01:25.250 --> 01:26.000
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS?
YES.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.125
YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF 'EM.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.917
I MEAN, I MAY NOT BE
IVY LEAGUE MATERIAL,

01:29.917 --> 01:32.000
BUT IF YOU GIVE ME A ROAD MAP
AND A REMOTE CONTROL,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.750
I CAN PROBABLY FIND MY WAY
TO THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL
AND BACK.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.250
THERE'RE LIKE 10 NIGHTS
OUT OF THE YEAR

01:36.250 --> 01:38.125
WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY
SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

01:38.125 --> 01:39.542
FROM THIS PART OF THE WORLD,
AND TOMORROW MAY BE ONE OF THEM.

01:39.542 --> 01:42.417
AND IF YOU FACTOR IN
THE RECENT
SUNSPOT ACTIVITY--

01:42.417 --> 01:43.667
NORTHERN LIGHTS, MY ASS.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.583
THIS GUY IS OBVIOUSLY
JUST TRYING TO SEPARATE

01:45.583 --> 01:47.583
YOU FROM THE POTTER
PANTALONES.

01:47.583 --> 01:49.417
PACEY, READ A NEWSPAPER
ONCE IN A WHILE.

01:49.417 --> 01:50.917
YOU CANNOT FAKE
GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY.

01:50.917 --> 01:51.875
OH, YEAH, YOU CAN.

01:51.875 --> 01:53.708
SURE YOU CAN!
YOU CAN FAKE ANYTHING!

01:53.708 --> 01:55.750
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
SOME IVY LEAGUE EGGHEAD,

01:55.750 --> 01:59.041
AND IT'S ALL PART OF
SOME GRAND ASTRONOMICAL
MAKE-OUT SCAM.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.708
I'M TALKING AS THE VOICE
OF REASON HERE, OK?

02:01.708 --> 02:03.917
I MEAN, COME ON,
THE CHANCES OF
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

02:03.917 --> 02:05.458
APPEARING IN
THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE CAPESIDE

02:05.458 --> 02:07.500
ARE AS GOOD AS THE CHANCES
OF ME ACQUITTING MYSELF

02:07.500 --> 02:09.208
WITH DISTINCTION
ON THAT STAGE TOMORROW.

02:09.208 --> 02:10.375
YEAH, WELL,
CALL ME CRAZY,

02:10.375 --> 02:12.250
BUT I'LL TAKE
THOSE ODDS ANY DAY.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.500
Dawson:
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:05.500 --> 03:05.875
Joey:
WHAT DO I THINK?

03:05.875 --> 03:08.125
YEAH.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.750
I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO BE PRETTY BORED
IN STUDY HALL, DAWSON.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.667
IT COULD BE A VERY
INTERESTING
OPPORTUNITY

03:12.667 --> 03:14.708
TO STUDY SOME
HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

03:14.708 --> 03:17.041
AT LEAST UNTIL
I FIGURE OUT WHAT MY
NEXT MOVE IS GONNA BE.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.792
JUST DON'T GO
JOINING THE YEARBOOK, OK?

03:19.792 --> 03:22.417
I MEAN, IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT PACEY'S DOING
THIS WHOLE PLAY THING.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.375
THAT'S RIGHT.
TONIGHT'S OPENING
NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

03:24.375 --> 03:25.875
YEAH...

03:25.875 --> 03:28.458
YOU DROPPED FILM CLASS?
ARE YOU INSANE?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.667
UM...

03:29.667 --> 03:32.333
I CAN TELL YOU GUYS
HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS,

03:32.333 --> 03:32.667
SO, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.834
OK.

03:35.708 --> 03:37.125
THIS DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

03:37.125 --> 03:39.625
WITH THE FILM FESTIVAL,
DOES IT?

03:39.625 --> 03:40.792
NO, IT DOESN'T.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.375
I JUST--I NEED
TO WALK AWAY FOR
A LITTLE WHILE.

03:42.375 --> 03:45.500
YOU KNOW?
RECHARGE MY
BATTERIES.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.583
WELL, THE LEAST
YOU COULD HAVE DONE

03:47.583 --> 03:49.667
WAS GIVEN
ME A HEADS-UP.

03:49.667 --> 03:50.625
WE'RE PARTNERS,
DAWSON.

03:50.625 --> 03:53.750
AND IN 3 DAYS
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STAND

03:53.750 --> 03:56.667
IN FRONT OF OUR ENTIRE CLASS
AND PITCH A FEATURE FILM.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.667
NIKKI, I'M SURE
MR. JORDAN WILL BE
MORE THAN HAPPY

03:58.667 --> 04:00.208
TO GIVE YOU
AN EXTENSION AND GET
YOU A NEW PARTNER.

04:00.208 --> 04:02.875
I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER PARTNER.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.250
I WANT YOU.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.750
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT

04:06.750 --> 04:08.792
THE ENTIRE
ASSIGNMENT
DONE ALREADY.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.750
WELL, YEAH,
BUT I WAS GONNA
ASK FOR YOUR IDEAS.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.250
WHEN YOU DID, YOU
WOULD HAVE REALIZED
THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.083
YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY IDEAS?

04:15.083 --> 04:17.875
DAWSON, YOU ARE
THE MOST CREATIVE
PERSON IN THE CLASS.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.708
SEE, THAT'S
WHERE YOU'D BE WRONG,

04:19.708 --> 04:21.250
BECAUSE, AS OF 8:15,

04:21.250 --> 04:23.667
I'M NOW THE MOST CREATIVE
PERSON NOT IN THE CLASS.

04:24.917 --> 04:25.917
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GO UP TONIGHT

04:25.917 --> 04:28.000
IF YOU KEEP
FORGETTING YOUR LINES?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.500
I KNOW THE LINES, OK?

04:29.500 --> 04:32.125
IT'S JUST THAT I GOT
A BIT OF RECALL DELAY,
THAT'S ALL.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.417
WHERE'S
MR. BRODERICK?

04:33.417 --> 04:35.708
OUR PLAY IS FALLING
APART AT THE SEAMS!

04:35.708 --> 04:37.333
PACEY, JUST TAKE IT
FROM THE TOP.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.542
SURE THING, BOSS.

04:38.542 --> 04:39.708
WHAT'S THE TOP AGAIN?

04:39.708 --> 04:40.792
YOUR ENTRANCE.

04:40.792 --> 04:41.375
ENTRANCE. RIGHT.

04:41.375 --> 04:42.792
ANDIE. ANDIE.

04:42.792 --> 04:45.083
NOT NOW, JACK.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.333
WE'RE TRYING TO DO
THIS LINE READ-THROUGH,

04:46.333 --> 04:48.875
BUT PACEY HAS
CONVENIENTLY CHOSEN

04:48.875 --> 04:50.208
TO LEAVE
HIS MEMORY AT HOME.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.375
YEAH, WELL,
ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO
IN ENGLISH CLASS,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.708
UH, MR. BRODERICK...
WHAT?

04:53.708 --> 04:55.166
JUST COME WITH ME.
COME ON. COME ON.

04:55.166 --> 04:56.375
COME ON.

04:56.375 --> 05:00.792
THE NURSE THINKS
IT'S A KIDNEY STONE.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.417
MY WIFE'S PICKING
ME UP IN 5 MINUTES.

05:03.417 --> 05:06.792
NO, NO, NO.
THE PLAY'S GOING UP
IN LESS THAN 8 HOURS.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.125
I'M SORRY, ANDIE.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.417
I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE IT THERE.

05:09.417 --> 05:12.625
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE MY PLACE.

05:12.625 --> 05:13.458
UH, NO, YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.458
SEE, I HAVE, UM,
TICKETS TO SELL

05:15.458 --> 05:17.792
AND THE AFTER-PARTY
TO SET UP.

05:17.792 --> 05:19.333
I CAN'T DO
EVERYTHING BY MYSELF!

05:19.333 --> 05:20.333
I CAN DO THE TICKETS
AND THE AFTER-PARTY.

05:20.333 --> 05:23.708
THERE YOU GO.
JACK'LL HELP YOU.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.041
I HAVE FAITH
IN YOU, ANDIE.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.667
I MEAN,
WHO AM I KIDDING?

05:27.667 --> 05:29.333
IT'S BEEN
YOUR SHOW ALL ALONG.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.875
THIS IS YOUR NIGHT.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.625
HERE.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.000
YOUR DIRECTOR'S BINDER?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.917
IT'S YOURS NOW.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.083
AND, AS THE
HOUSE LIGHTS FALL

05:41.083 --> 05:44.333
OVER THAT MAGIC PLACE
WE CALL THE THEATER,

05:44.333 --> 05:49.959
ALL I ASK IS
THAT YOU GIVE PAUSE
FOR A FLEETING MOMENT...

05:49.959 --> 05:51.291
AND THINK OF ME.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.792
HENRY!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.083
HEY, WAIT, PARKER!

06:09.083 --> 06:11.500
PARKER, WAIT UP!

06:26.041 --> 06:27.500
HI, HENRY.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.458
JEN...

06:28.458 --> 06:30.792
OK, WHY ARE
YOU AVOIDING ME?

06:30.792 --> 06:33.708
WHY ARE YOU CANCELING
ON DINNER TONIGHT?

06:33.708 --> 06:36.083
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I'M CANCELING?

06:36.083 --> 06:39.708
EVER SINCE YOU
AGREED TO THIS LITTLE...
DARE I CALL IT "DATE,"

06:39.708 --> 06:42.708
YOU DON'T EVEN
MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH ME IN THE HALLWAY.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.875
IT'S LIKE YOU GOT
THIS GIANT BLIND SPOT

06:44.875 --> 06:45.708
IN EXACTLY
MY SHAPE AND SIZE.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.542
OK, DON'T YOU
THINK THAT MAYBE

06:47.542 --> 06:49.083
YOU'RE JUST BEING
A LITTLE BIT PARANOID?

06:49.083 --> 06:50.708
ARE YOU OR ARE YOU NOT
CANCELING OUR DATE?

06:50.708 --> 06:51.917
I'M NOT
CANCELING ANYTHING.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.125
YOU'RE NOT?

06:55.125 --> 06:57.875
NO. NO, I'M...

06:57.875 --> 06:58.625
JUST POSTPONING.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.583
LOOK, SEE,
IT'S PACEY'S
OPENING NIGHT,

07:03.583 --> 07:06.667
AND I JUST FIGURED
THAT MAYBE I SHOULD
BE THERE TO SUPPORT HIM.

07:06.667 --> 07:09.333
SO THAT'S ALL
THIS IS ABOUT,
THE PLAY?

07:09.333 --> 07:10.834
YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S ALL
THIS IS ABOUT.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.542
GREAT.

07:12.542 --> 07:13.959
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, GREAT?

07:13.959 --> 07:16.417
I'LL GO WITH YOU...
TO THE PLAY.

07:16.417 --> 07:19.083
WHAT TIME'S CURTAIN?

07:19.083 --> 07:20.291
7:00.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.250
7:00. ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE THERE.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.959
I MEAN, IF THAT'S
ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.000
YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.375
OK.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.500
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT COMING NEAR ME

07:37.500 --> 07:39.667
WITH THAT MEDIEVAL
TORTURE DEVICE.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.250
[KNOCK KNOCK]

07:40.250 --> 07:41.625
THAT CAN'T BE HIM.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.083
JUST RELAX.
LET BODIE GET IT.

07:44.083 --> 07:47.250
AND FINISH TELLING ME
HOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO WORRY ABOUT

07:47.250 --> 07:49.875
YOU GOING OUT WITH
SOME MUCH OLDER GUY.

07:49.875 --> 07:54.208
HE'S NOT THAT OLD, BESSIE.
HE'S LIKE 19.

07:54.208 --> 07:54.792
[KNOCK KNOCK]

07:57.834 --> 08:00.583
WELL, IT'S A BOY.
JUST NOT THE ONE
WE EXPECTED.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.500
OK. SO I TANKED.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.750
I DID.
I COMPLETELY TANKED.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.500
CALM DOWN, PACEY,
YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.208
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS WAY BEYOND NERVOUS.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.875
YOU KNOW THAT READ-THROUGH? I
COULDN'T REMEMBER A SINGLE LINE.

08:14.875 --> 08:17.083
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
PSYCHING YOURSELF
OUT LIKE THIS.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.291
YOU KNOW THE PLAY. WE WENT
THROUGH IT 2 NIGHTS AGO.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.792
I KNOW THE PLAY WHEN
I'M RUNNING IT WITH YOU.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.667
WHEN I GOT TO DO IT
WITH HUMAN BEINGS, NOTHING.

08:22.667 --> 08:23.750
I KNOW I SUCK
FOR NOT BEING THERE.
I'M SORRY.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.125
YOU DO SUCK FOR
NOT BEING THERE, DON'T YOU?

08:26.125 --> 08:27.959
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE
OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK
IN MY GOOD BOOKS.

08:27.959 --> 08:31.583
THERE'S STILL THE AFTER-PARTY.
AND DON'T SAY NO TOO QUICKLY,

08:31.583 --> 08:33.332
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A SHOULDER TO CRY ON

08:33.332 --> 08:35.375
AFTER THIS NORTHERN
LIGHTS THING
DOESN'T WORK OUT.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.542
[LAUGHS]
OK, I'LL TRY.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.332
BUT DON'T
COUNT ON IT, ALL RIGHT?

08:39.332 --> 08:41.875
CURRENT GEOMAGNETIC
CONDITIONS ARE EXTREMELY
FAVORABLE

08:41.875 --> 08:43.332
FOR AURORAL ACTIVITY,
ACTUALLY.

08:43.332 --> 08:45.583
WHERE DID ALL THIS
SCIENTIFIC MUMBO-JUMBO
COME FROM?

08:45.583 --> 08:47.458
I THOUGHT THIS A.J. DUDE
WAS A POETRY GEEK.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.333
HE'S INTERESTED
IN MORE THAN JUST THAT.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.166
HE'S A RENAISSANCE MAN.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.083
FANTASTIC.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.458
HE CAN BORE YOU
IN 7 LANGUAGES.

08:53.458 --> 08:54.708
NO, JUST 3, ACTUALLY.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.875
ENGLISH, FRENCH,
AND LATIN.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.000
LATIN?
MM-HMM!

08:58.000 --> 09:00.166
WHO SPEAKS LATIN?
I MEAN, LIKE SPANISH,

09:00.166 --> 09:02.083
NOW, THAT'S THE FOREIGN
LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.041
BUT, LATIN,
THAT'S A DEAD LANGUAGE.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.125
HE'S HERE.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.917
OK, THANK YOU.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.250
IT'S NOT
TOO LATE TO BAIL, OK?

09:09.250 --> 09:10.458
BELIEVE ME.

09:10.458 --> 09:11.708
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO DO THAT, PACEY?

09:11.708 --> 09:13.375
BECAUSE THIS GUY'S
AN OPERATOR, OK?

09:13.375 --> 09:15.750
I CAN TELL. THE FIRST
THING HE'S GONNA DO

09:15.750 --> 09:17.208
WHEN HE COMES
THROUGH THAT DOOR,

09:17.208 --> 09:18.875
HE'S GONNA
PAY YOU SOME
LAME COMPLIMENT

09:18.875 --> 09:21.458
ABOUT HOW INCREDIBLE
YOU LOOK TONIGHT.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.542
PACEY.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.458
I'M LOOKING
OUT FOR YOU.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.875
AND THEN HE'LL
TRY SOMETHING CUTE,

09:26.875 --> 09:28.667
LIKE A NEGLIGIBLE
BUT NOT ENTIRELY
INSIGNIFICANT

09:28.667 --> 09:30.250
AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL
CONTACT, YOU KNOW?

09:30.250 --> 09:32.000
LIKE HELPING YOU
ON WITH YOUR COAT.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.500
IT'S CALLED BEING A GENTLEMAN.
I'M SURPRISED YOU'VE
HEARD OF IT.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.708
THIS PARTY
HE'S TAKING YOU TO?

09:35.708 --> 09:36.959
I BET IT DOESN'T
EVEN EXIST.

09:36.959 --> 09:37.917
IF IT DOES EXIST,
I WILL LAY YOU MONEY

09:37.917 --> 09:39.875
THAT OUR BOY WONDER
OVER THERE SEIZES

09:39.875 --> 09:41.583
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
TO GET YOU ALONE.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.083
STAY.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.250
HEY.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.834
HI.

09:54.542 --> 09:55.708
YOU LOOK, UH,
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.041
Joey: I SHOULD
GET MY COAT.

10:06.792 --> 10:08.333
LET ME HELP
YOU WITH THAT.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.125
HEY.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.375
THANK YOU.

10:47.291 --> 10:50.708
SO...WHO ARE
ALL THESE PEOPLE?

10:50.708 --> 10:52.917
WELL, THE GUY
WHO OWNS THE PLACE
IS A MATHEMATICIAN.

10:52.917 --> 10:57.000
ONCE UPON A TIME,
HE WAS MY MENTOR.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.792
AND EVERYBODY ELSE?

10:57.792 --> 11:00.083
HIS GRAD STUDENTS,
MOSTLY.

11:00.083 --> 11:05.250
SOME ASTROPHYSICISTS
AND OTHER LEFT-LEANING
IMPOVERISHED ACADEMICS.

11:05.250 --> 11:05.959
CAN'T YOU TELL?

11:05.959 --> 11:07.625
AND HOW
WOULD I TELL?

11:07.625 --> 11:09.834
WELL,
THE CHEAP HAIRCUTS,

11:09.834 --> 11:13.250
THE UNFORTUNATE
FASHION SENSE.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.458
THE PRETENTIOUS
TASTE IN BEVERAGES.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.000
IT'S MEAD.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.750
IT'S WHAT BEOWULF DRANK
BEFORE HE SLEW GRENDEL.

11:25.041 --> 11:27.542
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T.
IT'S...

11:27.542 --> 11:28.834
CAN'T I HAVE SOME?

11:28.834 --> 11:30.917
NO, IT'S ALCOHOLIC.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.000
AH.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.792
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
COLLEGE GUYS LIVED FOR.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.083
WHAT?

11:36.083 --> 11:39.333
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS
ALL LIQUORED UP.

11:40.667 --> 11:44.667
WELL, ONLY ONES
WITH VERY LITTLE
IMAGINATION.

11:44.667 --> 11:49.667
ALCOHOL ISN'T EXACTLY
THE MOST SOPHISTICATED WAY
TO SEDUCE A GIRL.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.583
I MEAN, THERE ARE
BETTER WAYS TO GO ABOUT IT.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.458
N-NOT THAT I MEAN--
I WASN'T--

11:56.458 --> 11:59.125
I WASN'T--
I'M NOT PLANNING ON...

12:00.959 --> 12:02.041
WHERE IS EVERYONE GOING?

12:05.041 --> 12:08.041
OH...
CLOUD COVER.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.458
VIEWING CONDITIONS
AREN'T EXACTLY CLEAR.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.959
DOES THAT
MEAN NO LIGHTS?

12:13.959 --> 12:15.500
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.208
IT COULD CLEAR UP
BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.959
MIDNIGHT.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.750
YEAH, FOR SOME
UNKNOWN REASON,

12:20.750 --> 12:22.792
MIDNIGHT--
ASTRONOMICAL MIDNIGHT,
TO BE EXACT--

12:22.792 --> 12:24.834
IS THE BEST TIME FOR
VIEWING AURORAL DISPLAYS.

12:24.834 --> 12:28.792
SO THAT MEANS
WE HAVE QUITE A WAIT
IN STORE FOR US.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.208
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TURN INTO A PUMPKIN

12:31.208 --> 12:31.959
IF I KEEP YOU
OUT THAT LATE, ARE YOU?

12:34.750 --> 12:34.959
NO.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.375
BUT I MIGHT
FREEZE TO DEATH,

12:39.375 --> 12:43.542
SO, UH...MAYBE WE
SHOULD GO INSIDE...

12:43.542 --> 12:47.208
AND MINGLE WITH
THOSE ASTROPHYSICISTS.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.500
LET'S TAKE A WALK FIRST.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.125
YOU WANT TO?

12:54.625 --> 12:56.417
SURE.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.333
OH, DAWSON,
THERE YOU ARE.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.667
WHERE'S PACEY?

13:06.667 --> 13:08.083
UH, AS DIRECTOR,
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE

13:08.083 --> 13:09.250
A BETTER IDEA
OF THAT THAN I DO?

13:09.250 --> 13:09.750
OH!

13:09.750 --> 13:11.708
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.917
UM, WELL, IT'S
ONLY 20 MINUTES
TILL CURTAIN CALL,

13:13.917 --> 13:15.000
AND MY LEAD IS
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.750
I COULD SWEAR I SAW
HIM COME IN EARLIER.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.375
OK, SO HE'S GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE,
RIGHT?

13:20.375 --> 13:21.417
I'LL GO
LOOK FOR HIM.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.834
OK, DAWSON,
DON'T LOOK, JUST FIND.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.542
PLEASE? AND TELL
HIM NOT TO WORRY.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.875
I'M NOT GONNA KILL HIM.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.125
TILL AFTER THE SHOW.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.166
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

13:44.166 --> 13:46.792
I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE
OF KNOWING HOW YOUR
BRAIN WORKS.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.291
YEAH.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.000
YOU KNOW, I SEEM
TO RECALL THAT THE
LAST TIME YOU AND I WERE

13:57.000 --> 14:00.166
ON A BASKETBALL COURT
TOGETHER, I ENDED UP
GETTING MY NOSE BROKEN.

14:00.166 --> 14:01.959
PACEY, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR
THIS. YOU'VE GOT A SHOW TO DO.

14:01.959 --> 14:04.500
OH, JUST A COUPLE MORE,
YOU KNOW? IT HELPS.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.834
IT'S PART OF THE WHOLE
ACTING PROCESS.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.208
SO WHAT ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS ABOUT?

14:08.208 --> 14:09.792
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'VE NEVER ACTED BEFORE.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.875
YEAH. HOW MANY TIMES
DID IT TAKE ME

14:11.875 --> 14:13.917
TO ACTUALLY GET
THAT SEA CREATURE
THING RIGHT?

14:14.917 --> 14:15.917
GOOD POINT.

14:15.917 --> 14:16.959
AND AT THAT POINT,

14:16.959 --> 14:20.708
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WERE WATCHING ME?

14:20.708 --> 14:22.208
AND FOR THAT MATTER,
HOW MANY EX-GIRLFRIENDS

14:22.208 --> 14:26.667
WERE THERE, COUNTING
ON ME TO DO A GOOD JOB?

14:26.667 --> 14:28.917
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.500
ACTING--YOU LIKE IT?
YOU HAVING FUN?

14:31.500 --> 14:34.625
WELL, I KIND OF
GOT BLACKMAILED
INTO THE WHOLE THING,

14:34.625 --> 14:37.708
BUT...
YEAH, I HAVE TO SAY
IT'S BEEN FUN.

14:37.708 --> 14:38.875
ACTUALLY, IT'S
BEEN A BLAST.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.750
SO THEN GO OUT
ON STAGE TONIGHT
AND HAVE A BLAST.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.208
IT'S ALL THAT MATTERS, MAN.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.041
FIND WHAT YOU
LOVE TO DO AND DO IT.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.083
THIS IS COMING FROM
A GUY WHO JUST GAVE UP
HIS LIFE'S PASSION

14:52.083 --> 14:53.750
TO HANG OUT WITH
THE UNDERACHIEVERS

14:53.750 --> 14:54.750
IN FOURTH PERIOD
STUDY HALL, RIGHT?

14:54.750 --> 14:57.083
I DIDN'T GIVE IT UP.

14:57.083 --> 15:00.417
I JUST DECIDED
TO SPREAD IT AROUND
A LITTLE BIT.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.208
WHEN DID YOU
BECOME ALL ZEN?

15:01.208 --> 15:02.250
I THOUGHT
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE

15:02.250 --> 15:04.792
WOULD BE FREAKING OUT
BIG TIME RIGHT NOW.

15:04.792 --> 15:05.875
WHY?

15:05.875 --> 15:07.458
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE BECAUSE OF

15:07.458 --> 15:08.125
JOEY'S BIG DATE
WITH COLLEGE GUY.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.458
I REALLY SUCK AT THIS GAME.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.500
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, OLIVIER,

15:17.500 --> 15:18.875
YOUR PUBLIC AWAITS.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.417
WHAT IF THIS GUY IS
SOME BIG SEX MANIAC?

15:20.417 --> 15:22.417
JOEY'S A BIG GIRL.

15:22.417 --> 15:23.500
I'M SURE SHE CAN
TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.083
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT
TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

15:25.083 --> 15:27.834
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
JOSEPHINE POTTER,

15:27.834 --> 15:30.458
THE GIRL WHOSE DESTINY
IS INTRINSICALLY LINKED
TO YOUR OWN.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.166
HAD TO
HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.792
YOU SAID THAT YOURSELF.

15:35.792 --> 15:36.125
LET'S GO.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.125
OH, PLEASE. OH, PLEASE.
OH, PLEASE.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.834
HEY--HENRY.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.083
HEY, I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA
MEET OUT IN FRONT.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.959
OH, I THOUGHT THAT
WHOEVER GOT HERE FIRST

16:00.959 --> 16:01.500
WAS SUPPOSED
TO SAVE SEATS,

16:01.500 --> 16:04.291
SO I DID.

16:06.959 --> 16:09.458
HENRY, I'D LIKE
YOU TO MEET MY GRAMS.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.500
YOUR GRANDMOTHER?

16:12.500 --> 16:15.458
GRAMS, THIS IS
HENRY PARKER.

16:15.458 --> 16:18.083
OH, WELL, WHAT
A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

16:18.083 --> 16:18.667
I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.125
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.708
JENNIFER, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME HENRY WAS COMING?

16:23.708 --> 16:25.041
I WOULD HAVE
GLADLY STAYED AT HOME

16:25.041 --> 16:26.166
SO THAT YOU TWO
COULD BE ALONE.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.583
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SHOW'S STARTING.

16:31.583 --> 16:32.250
WE SHOULD
TAKE OUR SEATS.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.166
HOW LONG DID YOU
SAY YOU'D BEEN MARRIED?

16:44.166 --> 16:45.625
6 DAYS.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.333
HE WON'T NOTICE
THE PLACE IS EMPTY
TILL JUNE.

16:47.333 --> 16:52.125
WELL, ELDORADO 58191,
HAVE A NICE MARRIAGE.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.500
DAWN, WE'VE GOT
TO GET YOU BUTTONED.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.125
OK, YOU LOOK GREAT.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

16:59.125 --> 17:00.500
ANDIE.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.750
PACEY, NO!
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

17:01.750 --> 17:04.666
I SENT YOUR
UNDERSTUDY INTO MAKEUP
15 MINUTES AGO.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.916
THAT'S GOOD.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.165
I THINK
HE SHOULD STAY THERE,

17:07.165 --> 17:07.666
'CAUSE, ANDIE,
I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:07.666 --> 17:08.834
WHAT? YOU CAN.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.834
COME HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:10.834 --> 17:12.416
I GAVE UP ON YOU KNOWING
THIS WORD FOR WORD

17:12.416 --> 17:13.625
A LONG TIME AGO.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.666
SO YOU'RE JUST
GONNA GET THE GENERAL
GIST OF IT,

17:15.666 --> 17:16.875
AND YOU ARE
GONNA BE FINE! OK?

17:16.875 --> 17:18.208
COME ON, LET'S GO!

17:18.208 --> 17:19.416
GO, YOU'RE UP!

17:19.416 --> 17:20.916
I DON'T KNOW...
COME ON,
COME ON!

17:20.916 --> 17:22.125
OH, WAIT.
NO, NO, NO, NO!

17:22.125 --> 17:23.541
THE SUITCASE!

17:23.541 --> 17:25.125
OK, GO!

17:27.083 --> 17:28.625
OH, PAUL, DARLING!

17:33.125 --> 17:34.375
UH...

17:34.375 --> 17:36.792
WELL?
SAY SOMETHING!

17:45.208 --> 17:46.792
IT'S 6 FLIGHTS!

17:46.792 --> 17:48.792
DID YOU KNOW
THAT IT'S 6 FLIGHTS?

17:48.792 --> 17:50.041
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

17:51.417 --> 17:53.083
IT ISN'T, IT'S 5.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.500
WHAT ABOUT THAT
BIG THING HANGING...

17:58.875 --> 18:00.041
Joey:
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S HOPE FOR ME?

18:00.041 --> 18:03.125
A.J.: I'M JUST
SAYING I WOULDN'T LET

18:03.125 --> 18:05.667
MY FAMILY'S FINANCES
LIMIT MY DREAMS.

18:08.792 --> 18:10.959
YOU THINK YOU WANT TO GO
TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL?

18:13.542 --> 18:15.667
I DON'T KNOW.

18:15.667 --> 18:16.959
I JUST KNOW
THAT IF I DON'T TRY,

18:16.959 --> 18:19.792
THEN I'LL ALWAYS WONDER.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.083
WONDER WHAT?

18:22.083 --> 18:24.792
IF I WAS GOOD ENOUGH.

18:24.792 --> 18:29.250
SMART ENOUGH TO...

18:29.250 --> 18:31.750
TO DO SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT
WITH MY LIFE.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.750
YOU SOUND PRETTY DRIVEN.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.708
YEAH. DRIVEN
BY FEAR OF FAILURE.

18:41.708 --> 18:45.166
YOU KNOW, I THINK
MAYBE SOMETIMES
THAT HAPPENS TO GIRLS

18:45.166 --> 18:47.333
WHO LOSE
THEIR MOTHERS WHEN
THEY'RE REALLY YOUNG.

18:49.917 --> 18:52.125
THEY'RE REALLY
DRIVEN TO SUCCEED.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.083
LIKE MADONNA?

18:56.083 --> 18:59.959
WELL, I WAS THINKING
MORE ALONG THE LINES
OF THE BRONTE SISTERS,

18:59.959 --> 19:02.291
BUT...

19:02.291 --> 19:04.417
FOR A WHILE I--I...

19:04.417 --> 19:06.166
I THOUGHT I LIKED ART.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.792
BUT NOW YOU
DON'T ANYMORE?

19:08.792 --> 19:11.750
NO, IT...

19:11.750 --> 19:14.125
I DO. IT'S--
I DON'T KNOW...

19:17.417 --> 19:18.959
IT'S LIKE
THERE'S THIS PERSON

19:18.959 --> 19:20.917
THAT YOU WANT TO BE
FOR OTHER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

19:20.917 --> 19:25.625
AND TO MAKE THEM HAPPY
AND TO MAKE THEM PROUD OF YOU.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.458
AND--AND THEN
THERE'S YOURSELF.

19:27.458 --> 19:31.291
AND...SOMETIMES IT'S
REALLY HARD TO TELL

19:31.291 --> 19:35.166
WHERE ONE ENDS
AND THE OTHER BEGINS.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.375
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

19:41.792 --> 19:44.417
YEAH...
COMPLETELY.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.542
YOU KNOW,
IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE,

19:52.542 --> 19:54.625
THEY USED TO THINK
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

19:54.625 --> 19:57.583
WERE SPIRITS
OF DEAD WARRIORS.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.667
AND NOW?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.625
WELL, NOW WE KNOW THAT
THEY'RE JUST CHARGED
PARTICLES OF THE SUN

20:03.625 --> 20:07.583
INTERACTING
WITH THE EARTH'S
UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.708
CHARGED PARTICLES.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.291
NOT TOO ROMANTIC.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.083
THINK ABOUT IT
FROM THE PARTICLES'
POINT OF VIEW.

I GOT HOME THAT DAY,

THE MOVIE POSTERS
OFF MY WALLS.

THERE'S THIS IMAGE
THAT I KEEP ON
COMING BACK TO.

24:29.917 --> 24:31.792
I'M 10 YEARS OLD.
MY PARENTS HAVE TAKEN ME
TO SEE JURASSIC PARK.

FLANKED BY MOM AND DAD.

24:37.792 --> 24:40.041

WALK IN. A GUY AND A GIRL.

24:40.041 --> 24:42.000
PROBABLY ABOUT OUR AGE.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.041
THEY SIT IN FRONT OF US,

24:44.041 --> 24:48.500
AND THEY PROCEED TO MAKE OUT
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE.

24:48.500 --> 24:52.458
AND I REMEMBER
SITTING THERE,
JUST BEING SHOCKED

24:52.458 --> 24:54.959
THAT ANYONE WOULD
RATHER KISS THAN WATCH

24:54.959 --> 24:56.291
THIS MIRACULOUS FANTASY
UNFOLD ONSCREEN.

24:56.291 --> 24:59.458
AND AT ONE--
AT ONE POINT,

24:59.458 --> 25:01.291
I ACTUALLY TAPPED
THE GUY ON THE SHOULDER

25:01.291 --> 25:04.333
AND ASKED HIM
IF HE WOULDN'T MIND
KEEPING IT DOWN.

25:04.333 --> 25:07.125
AND HE LOOKED
AT ME LIKE...

25:07.125 --> 25:10.333
"LOOK, ONE DAY, KID,
YOU'LL GET IT."

25:13.208 --> 25:15.834
AND HERE I AM,
ALL THESE YEARS LATER.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.583
AND I'M STILL NOT THE KID
WHO GOES TO THE MOVIE
THEATER JUST TO MAKE OUT.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.542
AND I'M NOT THE KID
WHO SAT BETWEEN
HIS PARENTS ANYMORE.

25:21.542 --> 25:24.959
I'M THIS THIRD PERSON
WHO'S SO BUSY ANALYZING
EVERYTHING

25:24.959 --> 25:26.500
THAT I CAN'T ENJOY ANYTHING.

THERE'S REALLY NO CHANCE

26:18.583 --> 26:20.583

THE NORTHERN LIGHTS
FROM THIS LATITUDE.

GETTING COLD, SO--

32:12.750 --> 32:15.000
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.667
NO.

32:16.667 --> 32:18.667
NEXT TIME.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.208
I'VE SEEN THEM BEFORE.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.625
WILL YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THEM?

32:32.667 --> 32:35.750
IT'S LIKE THE SKY YOU'VE
KNOWN YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.083
THE ONE YOU'VE LOOKED UP AT
EVERY NIGHT AS A KID.

32:39.041 --> 32:42.083
ONLY YOU LOOK UP AT IT,

32:42.083 --> 32:43.417
AND IT'S LIKE
IT'S ON FIRE.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.083
FLOODED WITH ALL
THESE BRILLIANT COLORS.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.166
SOUNDS KINDA SCARY.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.542
YEAH, IT IS.

32:57.542 --> 32:58.083
BUT BEAUTIFUL.

33:02.875 --> 33:05.125
NOT TOO
GLAMOROUS, HUH?

33:05.125 --> 33:08.417
STUCK WITH
CLEAN-UP DUTY
ON YOUR BIG NIGHT.

33:08.417 --> 33:10.041
I DON'T MIND.

33:11.542 --> 33:12.750
I'M SORRY DAD
COULDN'T BE HERE.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.333
OH, DON'T BE SORRY.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.667
I MEAN, THAT ACTUALLY
KIND OF MADE IT BETTER.

33:16.667 --> 33:20.458
YOU KNOW, BEING AROUND
ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO
DON'T KNOW ME SO WELL,

33:20.458 --> 33:21.583
WHO BELIEVE IN
THE PERSON I AM TODAY,

33:21.583 --> 33:26.166
THAT DON'T REALLY KNOW
EVERYTHING I USED TO BE.

33:26.166 --> 33:27.500
IT WAS GREAT.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.125
THE WHOLE NIGHT
I FELT LIKE...

33:29.125 --> 33:30.792
THE BELLE OF THE BALL?

33:30.792 --> 33:33.041
NO. MORE LIKE ME.

33:33.041 --> 33:34.625
LIKE MYSELF.

33:34.625 --> 33:37.500
WELL, THAT IS SOME OF
THE BEST NEWS I'VE
HEARD IN A LONG TIME.

33:37.500 --> 33:42.542
I HAD THIS, UH, THIS MANTRA
IN THE HOSPITAL.

33:42.542 --> 33:43.583
YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

33:43.583 --> 33:45.708
YEAH.

33:45.708 --> 33:48.041
STRUCTURE AND PURPOSE.

33:48.041 --> 33:50.166
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S JUST
A STUPID LITTLE SCHOOL PLAY,

33:50.166 --> 33:52.917
BUT THAT'S
WHAT IT WAS TO ME.

33:52.917 --> 33:55.166
STRUCTURE AND PURPOSE.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.834
I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IN YOUR LIFE,

33:57.834 --> 34:03.000
YOU KNOW, TO HOLD ON TO
THAT'S NOT ANOTHER PERSON,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.667
BUT IT'S MORE LIKE
A PART OF YOURSELF,

34:05.667 --> 34:07.291
YOU KNOW, LIKE
A GOAL OR A DREAM,

34:07.291 --> 34:10.458
THE WHOLE WORLD
FALLS APART AROUND YOU,

34:10.458 --> 34:11.542
YOU'LL BE OK.

34:11.542 --> 34:15.083
AND YOU ARE...OK?

34:15.083 --> 34:17.708
YEAH, I'M GREAT.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.708
YOU SURE
YOU'RE THAT GREAT?

34:26.041 --> 34:28.917
THERE'S
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

34:39.917 --> 34:41.792
HEY.

34:41.792 --> 34:43.875
HEY.

34:43.875 --> 34:47.375
YOU WEREN'T EXACTLY
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
TONIGHT.

34:47.375 --> 34:51.458
NO, I GUESS I GOT
A LOT OF STUFF
ON MY MIND.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.875
YEAH, IT'S TOO BAD
YOUR PARENTS COULDN'T COME.

34:52.875 --> 34:55.333
WELL, AS IT TURNS OUT,

34:55.333 --> 34:57.708
THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T
MAKE IT TONIGHT,

34:57.708 --> 34:58.708
SO C'EST LA VIE.

34:58.708 --> 35:00.750
YEAH, BUT I MEAN,
TOO BAD THEY COULDN'T

35:00.750 --> 35:03.834
SEE YOU BEING
A STAR AND ALL TONIGHT.

35:03.834 --> 35:07.041
I THINK YOU AND I BOTH
KNOW WHO THE REAL STAR
OF THAT PRODUCTION IS.

35:07.041 --> 35:09.458
I MEAN, THE ACTORS,
ALL WE DO IS COME ON
AT THE LAST MOMENT

35:09.458 --> 35:11.083
AND GRAB ALL THE GLORY,

35:11.083 --> 35:13.208
WHEREAS THE PEOPLE WHO
WORK BEHIND THE SCENES,

35:13.208 --> 35:15.417
YOU GUYS ARE
THE ONES WHO MAKE
EVERYTHING HAPPEN.

35:15.417 --> 35:18.000
I MEAN, NOBODY EVER
KNOWS ALL THE WORK
THAT YOU GUYS DO.

35:19.333 --> 35:20.708
THEY KNOW.

35:23.583 --> 35:26.125
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT
GUARANTEED "C" IN ENGLISH.

35:26.125 --> 35:30.208
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,
AREN'T YOU?

35:30.208 --> 35:32.834
ABOUT MY PATHETIC
RETURN TO THE DEPTHS
OF ACADEMIC MEDIOCRITY?

35:32.834 --> 35:35.625
I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED.

35:35.625 --> 35:40.291
GIRLS HAVE THESE
IDIOTIC, MISGUIDED
NOTIONS ABOUT GUYS.

35:40.291 --> 35:42.208
I MEAN, WE THINK
WE CAN SPRUCE 'EM UP

35:42.208 --> 35:44.792
AND TURN 'EM INTO
SOMETHING THEY'RE NOT.

35:44.792 --> 35:48.667
IN YOUR DEFENSE,
I WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'D CALL A LUXURY MODEL.

35:48.667 --> 35:51.125
I DID HAVE FIXER-UPPER
WRITTEN ALL OVER ME.

35:51.125 --> 35:54.291
YEAH, YOU PRETTY MUCH
WERE PRICED TO SELL,
WEREN'T YOU?

35:54.291 --> 35:55.417
YES, I WAS.
DAMAGED GOODS.

36:00.917 --> 36:03.417
BUT, UH,
THING IS, PACEY...

36:04.792 --> 36:06.875
I WAS WRONG.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.708
THERE WAS NEVER
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
THAT NEEDED FIXING UP.

36:11.708 --> 36:15.250
AND THERE NEVER WAS,
AND THERE NEVER WILL BE.

36:16.333 --> 36:17.875
'CAUSE YOU'RE
PERFECT AS IS.

36:21.625 --> 36:23.041
YOU, TOO, ANDIE.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.083
[SIGHS]

36:32.083 --> 36:33.166
WHAT?

36:33.166 --> 36:33.291
I'M TRYING.

36:36.667 --> 36:40.375
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU THINK
MY NEXT PROJECT SHOULD BE?

36:40.375 --> 36:43.333
IT DEFINITELY
WON'T BE INVOLVING YOU.

36:43.333 --> 36:46.250
NO. MY PEOPLE
WILL CERTAINLY NOT
BE CALLING YOUR PEOPLE.

36:46.250 --> 36:48.000
UM, I DON'T KNOW,

36:48.000 --> 36:49.667
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
AN ALL-GIRL CAST.

36:49.667 --> 36:50.625
OR PERHAPS PUPPETS.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.250
YOU KNOW, PUPPETS
ARE REALLY GOOD.

36:52.250 --> 36:54.000
THEY'RE
VERY DIRECTABLE,
UNLIKE MYSELF.

36:55.041 --> 36:57.667
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN
I FELT THIS DEPRESSED.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.208
OH, YEAH.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.250
10 MINUTES AGO.

37:03.250 --> 37:05.750
YOU'LL GET NO SYMPATHY
FROM THESE QUARTERS.

37:07.041 --> 37:07.500
I KNOW.

37:10.125 --> 37:11.458
FOR A SECOND THERE,
I THOUGHT I SAW YOU
SMILING.

37:14.375 --> 37:16.458
YOU ARE NOT
LIKE OTHER BOYS.

37:16.458 --> 37:18.166
HAS ANYBODY
TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE?

37:19.208 --> 37:21.125
YEAH, YOU.

37:21.125 --> 37:23.959
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU GOTTA STOP IT
WITH THESE GRAND GESTURES,

37:23.959 --> 37:25.959
THESE LARGER-THAN-LIFE
PUBLIC DECLARATIONS.

37:25.959 --> 37:27.542
THEY'RE...

37:29.166 --> 37:31.959
YOU'RE LIKE THE CHRISTO
OF TEENAGE CRUSHES.

37:33.291 --> 37:34.417
WHO'S CHRISTO?

37:34.417 --> 37:38.417
HE'S--WELL, HE'S
KIND OF LIKE A SCULPTOR.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.125
HE DOES THESE
REALLY LARGE...

37:40.917 --> 37:43.125
NEVER MIND.

37:44.792 --> 37:47.125
IT'S JUST THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE TO TRY SO HARD.

37:48.583 --> 37:54.417
IT'S JUST THAT...
I WANT TO KNOW YOU,
JEN LINDLEY.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.583
I WANT TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

37:57.583 --> 37:59.375
TOTALLY AND
COMPLETELY HONEST.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.458
NOBODY CAN EVER BE
COMPLETELY HONEST, HENRY.

38:01.458 --> 38:05.417
NO ONE OVER
THE AGE OF 6, THAT IS.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.000
I CAN.

38:09.375 --> 38:11.708
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN, CAN'T YOU?

38:13.417 --> 38:18.917
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
OR HOW YOU MANAGED TO
KEEP IT FOR SO LONG,

38:18.917 --> 38:22.542
BUT YOU'VE
DEFINITELY GOT THAT THING
THAT CHILDREN HAVE.

38:22.542 --> 38:25.083
YOU HAVE IT, TOO.

38:25.083 --> 38:28.000
YOU'VE JUST...
FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.625
NO.

38:30.625 --> 38:33.250
HENRY, I DON'T THINK
THAT I EVER HAD IT.

38:33.250 --> 38:36.375
THEN I CAN TEACH YOU.

38:37.834 --> 38:39.041
JUST SAY WHAT'S EVER
IN YOUR HEART RIGHT NOW,

38:39.041 --> 38:41.875
RIGHT AT THIS INSTANT.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.125
WAS THAT HONEST ENOUGH?

38:51.583 --> 38:52.583
ALMOST.

38:54.959 --> 38:58.417
I'D SAY ABOUT 70%.

39:10.625 --> 39:11.750
NOT SO FAST.

39:11.750 --> 39:15.000
A CERTAIN BOY WE BOTH KNOW
IS WAITING TO SEE YOU.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.125
DAWSON?

39:31.125 --> 39:32.667
HEY, I'M SORRY
TO SHOW UP LIKE THIS.

39:32.667 --> 39:33.625
I KNOW YOU JUST
GOT BACK FROM YOUR DATE.

39:33.625 --> 39:36.375
LOOK, IF THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT--

39:36.375 --> 39:37.500
NO, IT'S NOT.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.959
IT'S NOT. I SWEAR.

39:45.166 --> 39:48.041
HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY DATE, ANYWAY?

39:49.041 --> 39:50.959
PACEY TOLD ME.

39:50.959 --> 39:52.458
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.917
IF ANYBODY
HAS TO EXPLAIN,

39:53.917 --> 39:55.792
IT'S ME, SHOWING UP
LIKE THIS.

39:57.417 --> 40:00.417
SO WHY DID YOU
SHOW UP LIKE THIS?

40:04.708 --> 40:07.834
I NEEDED
TO SEE YOU.

40:07.834 --> 40:10.375
YOU KNOW?
I JUST--

40:10.375 --> 40:13.291
I SUDDENLY
FELT VERY LOST.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.291
HOW DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE GOING TO FEEL

40:18.291 --> 40:19.792
AFTER YOU TOOK DOWN
ALL YOUR POSTERS

40:19.792 --> 40:22.834
AND SUDDENLY DECIDED
TO DROP FILM CLASS?

40:25.250 --> 40:30.458
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK.
I JUST...DID.

40:32.166 --> 40:33.792
AND NOW YOU'RE THINKING,

40:33.792 --> 40:37.917
AND YOU REALIZE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
YOU ARE ANYMORE?

40:40.708 --> 40:42.750
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH.

40:47.041 --> 40:49.125
I THINK YOU
LOST YOUR TRUE NORTH.

40:52.125 --> 40:54.750
THAT FIXED POINT
IN THE NIGHT SKY

40:54.750 --> 40:57.250
THAT YOU
GUIDE YOURSELF BY.

41:03.375 --> 41:04.625
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR TRUE NORTH?

41:11.041 --> 41:13.583
I DON'T THINK I HAVE ONE.

41:21.708 --> 41:23.542
WHAT IS THAT?

41:28.708 --> 41:31.041
THE AURORA BOREALIS.

41:31.041 --> 41:33.041
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS?

41:33.041 --> 41:35.708
AREN'T WE A LITTLE
TOO FAR SOUTH FOR THAT
HERE IN CAPESIDE?

41:35.708 --> 41:38.959
APPARENTLY NOT.

41:38.959 --> 41:42.250
IT'S FUNNY.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
ALL NIGHT FOR THIS,

41:42.250 --> 41:44.375
AND IT HAPPENS NOW,
WITH YOU.

41:46.917 --> 41:48.959
IS THAT A BAD THING?

41:52.500 --> 41:54.708
NO. IT'S, UH...

41:54.708 --> 41:56.750
IT'S JUST TYPICAL.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.834
I THOUGHT THEY'D BE
BLUER THAN THIS.

42:31.291 --> 42:33.792
[♪♪♪]
