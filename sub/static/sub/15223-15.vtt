01:01.234 --> 01:02.334
Louie.

01:02.367 --> 01:03.334
Huh?

01:03.367 --> 01:04.501
Louie.

01:04.534 --> 01:08.868
Listen, I have a bad cavity
in my tooth.

01:08.901 --> 01:13.901
So is it okay if I leave early
and go to the dentist?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.701
The dentist.
Yeah.

01:18.734 --> 01:21.100
That reminds
me of a story I
heard yesterday.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.133
Yeah?

01:22.167 --> 01:24.567
This guy goes
into the dentist's office

01:24.601 --> 01:27.901
and he says to the nurse,
he says, "Nurse, me and my wife

01:27.934 --> 01:30.067
"are having
very bad sexual problems.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.234
So could I please make
an appointment?"

01:32.267 --> 01:35.567
So the nurse says, "Oh, sir,
you don't need a dentist.

01:35.601 --> 01:37.234
You need a psychologist."

01:37.267 --> 01:40.234
And he said, "No, no, nurse,
I need a dentist.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.667
With my wife,
it's like pulling teeth."

01:52.667 --> 01:55.634
So that means it's all right
to go to the dentist?

01:55.667 --> 01:57.167
No, no, no way.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.100
Okay, now get back
to work, Latka.

01:59.133 --> 02:00.534
TONY:
Hey, fellas.

02:00.567 --> 02:01.868
ELAINE:
Hi, Tony.

02:01.901 --> 02:03.868
Did you have a good weekend?

02:03.901 --> 02:07.400
Nah, I went on a blind date,
and I hate blind dates.

02:07.434 --> 02:09.100
So what did you
go on one for?

02:09.133 --> 02:11.200
Sort of a favor to Bobby.

02:11.234 --> 02:13.100
See, he had
this really terrific date

02:13.133 --> 02:15.868
with this really terrific girl,
and she had a cousin

02:15.901 --> 02:18.200
who she didn't want
to leave home

02:18.234 --> 02:20.200
so I had to go along.

02:20.234 --> 02:21.601
Well, what do you mean
you had to go along?

02:21.634 --> 02:23.434
Well, you know, Bobby's
sort of my best friend.

02:23.467 --> 02:24.901
I couldn't let him down.

02:24.934 --> 02:27.167
Well, why not? I mean, just
'cause he's your best friend

02:27.200 --> 02:29.601
doesn't mean you have to do
everything he wants you to do.

02:29.634 --> 02:30.801
Of course, it does.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.701
That's exactly what it means.

02:32.734 --> 02:35.767
When I was a kid, I had
this best friend, Bob McDaniel.

02:35.801 --> 02:38.033
Whenever either one of us
needed anything,

02:38.067 --> 02:40.667
the other would come a-running,
no matter what.

02:40.701 --> 02:42.801
We even had a special call
we made up.

02:42.834 --> 02:45.567
I still remember it.

02:45.601 --> 02:47.033
Yak-yak-yak-a-bye.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.033
Yak-a-bye.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.601
Yak-a-bye.

02:51.267 --> 02:52.734
Nobody panic.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.767
Where is the yakabye?

02:54.801 --> 02:56.901
No.

02:58.868 --> 03:01.534
No, Latka. No Yakabye.

03:01.567 --> 03:02.968
Oh, it's a false alarm?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.534
Uh-huh.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.734
It's okay, no Yakabye.

03:09.067 --> 03:10.367
Hi, Latka.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.868
Hello.

03:11.901 --> 03:15.300
Oh, too bad--
you miss Yakabye drill.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.367
Shucks.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.534
Hey, so you really had
a good time on your date?

03:21.567 --> 03:23.667
Oh, Alex, Dominique
is one terrific lady.

03:23.701 --> 03:24.901
Yeah?

03:24.934 --> 03:27.167
I haven't felt this way
about a girl in a long time.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
Oh, that's terrific.

03:28.234 --> 03:29.868
Hey, how about you, Tony?
How was your date?

03:29.901 --> 03:31.300
I don't want
to talk about it.

03:31.334 --> 03:32.534
Hey, what are you
talking about?

03:32.567 --> 03:34.100
I thought you two
had a lot in common.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.501
Why? 'Cause she wanted
to be a boxer?

03:36.534 --> 03:38.467
I never want to see her again

03:38.501 --> 03:41.667
especially in the ring--
I wouldn't have a chance.

03:41.701 --> 03:43.601
Hey, Banta, telephone.

03:43.634 --> 03:45.267
Hey, you guys
want to come over

03:45.300 --> 03:47.567
to my house Sunday
and watch the big game?

03:47.601 --> 03:48.934
Hey, hey,
that's an idea.

03:48.968 --> 03:50.901
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm taking
the kids to the movies.

03:50.934 --> 03:53.200
Oh, Suzanne and I
have plans too.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.734
Hey, Latka, you want to watch

03:54.767 --> 03:56.534
the football game
in my apartment?

03:56.567 --> 03:58.067
Okay, thank you.

03:58.100 --> 04:01.567
It's better than watching it
on television.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.734
I'll explain it to him later.

04:06.767 --> 04:08.067
Hey, guess what, guys!

04:08.100 --> 04:10.200
I'm fighting tomorrow,
out of town.

04:10.234 --> 04:11.534
Where you fighting?

04:11.567 --> 04:12.534
I'm fighting in Scranton.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.200
I'm fighting the state champ.

04:14.234 --> 04:15.601
Hey, Pennsylvania's
supposed to be

04:15.634 --> 04:17.200
a really tough boxing state,
isn't it?

04:17.233 --> 04:19.701
Oh, no, no, no. I'm fighting the
state champ of New hampshire.

04:19.733 --> 04:21.868
Do they have a lot of
middleweights in New Hampshire?

04:21.901 --> 04:23.467
Three. The guy I'm fighting

04:23.501 --> 04:26.067
just took the title away
from his father.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.801
You're not just
fighting a champ--

04:27.834 --> 04:29.133
you're fighting a whole dynasty.

04:29.167 --> 04:31.300
Yeah, that's right.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.300
Hey, I got to go to the gym,
pick up my stuff

04:35.334 --> 04:36.367
cancel the paper.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.200
Hey, Bobby,
will you feed my fish?

04:38.234 --> 04:39.200
Uh, Tony, I...

04:39.234 --> 04:40.734
I'll bring them
to your place.

04:40.767 --> 04:41.667
Don't worry, man!

04:41.701 --> 04:43.234
A pinch of food
every morning.

04:43.267 --> 04:45.968
Yeah, but Tony, I don't know
anything about fish.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.400
There's nothing to it, man.
Ten seconds a day.

04:50.033 --> 04:52.467
Why don't you ask somebody else
to do it all right?

04:52.501 --> 04:53.501
I'm asking you.

04:53.534 --> 04:55.467
I do a lot of stuff for you.

04:55.501 --> 04:58.100
Can't you do one little thing
for me?

04:58.133 --> 05:00.767
All right,
give me your fish.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.267
You're going to love them.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.334
Now listen, make sure you feed
them every day

05:04.367 --> 05:06.067
because me and my fish
go back a long way.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.267
I mean almost four years.

05:07.300 --> 05:11.100
I bought them with the purse
from my first big win-- $3.00.

05:11.133 --> 05:13.601
Wow.

05:13.634 --> 05:15.701
I got to go. See ya.

05:15.734 --> 05:17.033
Get 'em, Tony!

05:17.067 --> 05:18.100
So long, Tony.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.534
Tony!

05:19.567 --> 05:20.601
Oh...

05:20.634 --> 05:22.534
Oh, my.

05:22.567 --> 05:24.534
Oh, me, oh, my.

05:24.567 --> 05:27.467
Oh, I don't know
what to do.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.968
Oh, it's so bad.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.701
Wait, wait.
Does that hurt that bad?

05:31.734 --> 05:32.701
Yes.

05:32.734 --> 05:33.701
This is bad?

05:33.734 --> 05:34.701
Ow!

05:34.734 --> 05:36.100
All right, all right,
go to the...

05:36.133 --> 05:37.334
You better go to the dentist.

05:37.367 --> 05:40.100
Oh, thank you very much.

05:40.133 --> 05:43.534
You know, Louie, you know,
sometime people talk about you.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.534
They say bad things
about you.

05:45.567 --> 05:48.801
They say that you
are cheap and mean

05:48.834 --> 05:51.267
and cruel and nasty.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.834
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

06:06.868 --> 06:13.000
ALEX:
Hey, Bobby,
you in there? Bobby?

06:13.033 --> 06:15.167
He's not in there.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.834
Wait a minute, he usually leaves
the key out here somewhere.

06:18.868 --> 06:20.200
Ah, ah, there it is.

06:23.901 --> 06:25.834
I guess he must have
gone out for a while.

06:25.868 --> 06:27.767
Hey, Latka, why don't
you put the game on,

06:27.801 --> 06:29.367
and I'll stick this
in the fridge.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.534
Okay.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.934
I hope he went out
to shop.

06:33.968 --> 06:36.868
There's only a loaf
of old bread in here.

06:36.901 --> 06:39.033
We could have beer and toast.

06:39.067 --> 06:40.300
No, thank you.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.968
I'm trying to watch my <i>babas.</i>

06:44.734 --> 06:46.033
Hey, there he is.

06:46.067 --> 06:49.200
Come on, Bobby, you're
going to miss the kickoff.

06:49.234 --> 06:52.200
Hey, you just getting in?

06:52.234 --> 06:54.601
Yeah.

06:54.634 --> 06:57.033
You devil.

06:58.067 --> 07:00.467
No, it really wasn't like that.

07:00.501 --> 07:02.834
Dominique and I spent
the whole night talking.

07:02.868 --> 07:03.968
Oh, yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.300
Yeah, she told me
her life story, man.

07:06.334 --> 07:07.534
What a great girl!

07:07.567 --> 07:10.534
You know,
she turned down Warren Beatty.

07:10.567 --> 07:11.868
Imagine that.

07:11.901 --> 07:15.367
Me and Warren being
turned down by the same girl.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.834
Hey, you guys want some toast?

07:18.868 --> 07:20.400
ALEX:
Hey, come on, Bobby

07:20.434 --> 07:22.567
you're going to miss
a great game.

07:22.601 --> 07:24.400
You like football,
Latka?

07:24.434 --> 07:27.767
Well, you know, this football
is very confusing.

07:27.801 --> 07:29.133
What's confusing?

07:29.167 --> 07:33.300
Well, you see, because this team
here is called the Giants,

07:33.334 --> 07:37.067
but they are not bigger
than the other team.

07:37.100 --> 07:41.200
And also, this team
is called the Redskins,

07:41.234 --> 07:44.267
but they are almost all black.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.367
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

07:48.868 --> 07:49.901
Hello?

07:49.934 --> 07:52.200
Yeah... hey, it's Tony.

07:52.234 --> 07:53.400
Hey, wow, how you doing?

07:53.434 --> 07:54.834
Hey, let me talk.

07:54.868 --> 07:55.901
Here's Alex.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.801
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

07:58.834 --> 08:01.167
Yeah, how's Scranton?

08:01.200 --> 08:04.167
Oh, you took your camera,
that's great.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.834
Yeah, what?

08:05.868 --> 08:09.267
Really? And they're staying
at your hotel?

08:09.300 --> 08:10.133
Who? Who?

08:10.167 --> 08:12.834
The Platters.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.501
Hey, Tony, are those
the original Platters?

08:15.534 --> 08:18.334
Oh, just one cousin?

08:18.367 --> 08:19.634
Yeah, okay...

08:19.667 --> 08:22.634
Hey, listen, Tony--
drop that guy, you hear me?

08:22.667 --> 08:24.167
Drop him!

08:24.200 --> 08:25.501
Yeah, okay.

08:25.534 --> 08:27.267
No, here's Bob.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.000
So, champ, how you feeling?

08:30.033 --> 08:32.167
Yeah, yeah, the fish are fine.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.400
Yeah, the two of them.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.868
Look, you just worry
about the fight, okay?

08:35.900 --> 08:37.400
All right, now, listen

08:37.433 --> 08:40.534
the three of us
are really pulling for you, man.

08:40.567 --> 08:45.033
Okay, the five of us
are really pulling for you.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.367
Okay, now you do good, all
right?

08:47.400 --> 08:48.901
All right, all right,
come home a winner.

08:48.934 --> 08:50.367
All right, bye-bye.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.868
What a crazy guy.

08:51.901 --> 08:54.300
Yeah. Hey, Bobby, you're
missing a great game here.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.634
I'll be there.

08:55.667 --> 08:58.067
ALEX:
Oh, look
at that catch.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.133
Hey, Bobby, come here.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.534
You can see the replay.

09:00.567 --> 09:03.467
You know, in my country,
they don't have instant replay.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.868
They just make them
do it over again.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
That Tony, it's the biggest
fight of his career

09:10.033 --> 09:12.534
and he's worrying
about two dumb fish.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.634
Man, how can anybody care
about these things?

09:15.667 --> 09:17.033
Two little nothings.

09:17.067 --> 09:19.534
Just floating around
on their backs.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.367
They do move their fins,
you know, Bob?

09:24.400 --> 09:27.167
Uh-uh, not these.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.801
They're just lying there.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.734
Bobby, did you feed
those fish today?

09:37.767 --> 09:38.834
How could I?

09:38.868 --> 09:39.834
I was busy.

09:39.868 --> 09:41.100
You know, I just got home.

09:41.133 --> 09:42.767
Don't worry about it.

09:42.801 --> 09:44.133
I'll feed them now.

09:47.901 --> 09:50.567
I don't want
to go over there.

09:52.901 --> 09:54.334
Will you look at that?

09:54.367 --> 09:56.033
They're not even hungry.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.868
Come on,
roll over and eat.

09:57.901 --> 09:58.868
Come on!

09:58.901 --> 10:01.267
Oh, my God!

10:01.300 --> 10:02.801
What?

10:02.834 --> 10:04.801
They're dead, Bobby.
They're dead.

10:04.834 --> 10:09.534
Well, I guess it was
just their time, huh?

10:09.567 --> 10:10.200
Their time?

10:10.234 --> 10:11.968
Both of them, together?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.367
I don't know, I don't know.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.934
Maybe it was one of those
murder-suicide things.

10:25.267 --> 10:27.234
What's Bobby
going to do?

10:27.267 --> 10:28.234
I don't know.

10:28.267 --> 10:30.567
He just said stall Tony
until he gets here.

10:30.601 --> 10:32.334
Those fish really meant
a lot to Tony.

10:32.367 --> 10:33.968
He's going
to be heartbroken.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.901
I love it.

10:35.934 --> 10:40.067
Now, listen, Louie--
this is a very
sensitive situation.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.167
When Tony comes in

10:41.200 --> 10:43.234
if I hear you say one word,
like...

10:43.267 --> 10:44.734
Bobby killed your fish.

10:44.767 --> 10:45.734
That's right.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.334
Hey, what's happening, guys?

10:47.367 --> 10:48.367
Nothing.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.367
Oh, hi, Tony.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.934
Hey, how was the fight?

10:50.968 --> 10:52.300
Oh, I lost.

10:52.334 --> 10:53.334
It's all right, Elaine.

10:53.367 --> 10:54.534
The guy told me I gave him

10:54.567 --> 10:56.200
a much better fight
than his old man.

10:56.234 --> 10:58.701
Hey, so, where's Bobby?

10:58.734 --> 10:59.734
Huh, Bobby?

10:59.767 --> 11:01.033
He's... uh... he called.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.200
He's going to be a little late.

11:03.234 --> 11:04.400
So, how was Scranton?

11:04.434 --> 11:05.567
Man, was it cold.

11:05.601 --> 11:07.434
Half the time
I was frozen stiff.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.501
Speaking of stiffs...

11:08.534 --> 11:08.901
So...

11:11.367 --> 11:13.868
What have you got in the bag?

11:13.901 --> 11:15.534
Oh, wait till you see.

11:20.467 --> 11:21.968
It's a little castle.

11:22.033 --> 11:23.033
Oh.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.934
I bought it for my fish.

11:24.968 --> 11:27.634
You know, I think they can swim
in and out.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.868
I thought I'd surprise them.

11:29.901 --> 11:32.200
They're going
to love it, Tony.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.634
You see? It's got "Scranton"
on it and everything.

11:34.667 --> 11:37.067
You know

11:37.100 --> 11:39.467
I know it may seem
a little weird

11:39.501 --> 11:41.734
to care about them
the way I do,

11:41.767 --> 11:44.734
but I mean, to me,
them fish are like symbols.

11:44.767 --> 11:46.901
I mean, of, like, survival.

11:46.934 --> 11:50.234
If them little fish
can survive in this world

11:50.267 --> 11:51.300
than so can I.

11:51.334 --> 11:52.901
You know what I mean?

11:52.934 --> 11:55.267
I can't wait
to see them again.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.934
Hey, Alex, you saw
them yesterday.

11:56.968 --> 11:58.334
How did they look?

12:00.234 --> 12:03.267
Peaceful.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.667
Yeah, they're so easy-going.

12:04.701 --> 12:07.067
Hey, I'm going to put
this stuff away.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.868
I'll be back.

12:08.901 --> 12:13.067
Somebody has got to tell
him soon, for my sake.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.200
Boy, I'm really glad
I'm not Bobby.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.200
It's going to break
the guy's heart.

12:17.234 --> 12:20.000
This is great.

12:21.901 --> 12:23.267
Is he here yet?

12:23.300 --> 12:24.868
Where have you been?

12:24.901 --> 12:26.300
I had to go to four stores

12:26.334 --> 12:28.334
before I could find
two that matched exactly.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.701
ELAINE:
I just hope
this works.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.234
Hey, Bobby.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.501
Yeah, it's Bobby.

12:32.534 --> 12:33.601
Look at that.

12:33.634 --> 12:35.234
Hey, Tony, how'd the fight go?

12:35.267 --> 12:36.234
Oh, I lost.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.234
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:37.267 --> 12:38.234
Hey...

12:38.267 --> 12:39.567
They look great, huh?

12:39.601 --> 12:40.567
Yeah.

12:40.601 --> 12:42.534
Healthy, strong, happy, huh?

12:42.567 --> 12:44.067
Oh, gee, thanks, Bobby.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.067
Oh, forget it.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.234
No, I mean it.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.901
I really love these guys.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.601
I hope they get along
with my fish.

12:53.267 --> 12:54.467
Hey, where are they?

13:02.501 --> 13:03.534
Tony?

13:03.567 --> 13:04.868
Yeah.

13:04.901 --> 13:07.133
Uh, I-I-I-I got to tell you
something.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.501
What's that, Bob?

13:08.534 --> 13:12.834
Um, your fish...
uh, they didn't make it.

13:14.234 --> 13:15.601
What?

13:15.634 --> 13:18.767
Tony, I forgot to feed them
yesterday

13:18.801 --> 13:21.601
and when I came home
they were...

13:21.634 --> 13:23.567
My fish?

13:23.601 --> 13:26.400
Listen, I'd give anything
if it didn't happen, man.

13:26.434 --> 13:29.133
My fish are dead.

13:29.167 --> 13:32.534
Look, I know
it doesn't help much

13:32.567 --> 13:36.434
but I think they went
in their sleep.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.868
Where are they now?

13:41.901 --> 13:44.167
Did you flush them?

13:44.200 --> 13:46.200
I wouldn't do that, Tony.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.200
No, man.

13:47.234 --> 13:48.601
I saved them for you.

13:49.868 --> 13:52.000
I got them right here.

13:56.434 --> 13:58.300
You killed my fish.

13:58.334 --> 14:00.667
Hey, Tony, listen...

14:00.701 --> 14:03.701
if you want to slug me...
just not in the face.

14:03.734 --> 14:05.501
I got an audition.

14:09.434 --> 14:11.901
I don't want
to slug you, Bobby.

14:11.934 --> 14:16.000
I don't want to have
nothing to do with you, <i>friend.</i>

14:29.367 --> 14:31.968
Hey, Tony,
what did you book?

14:32.000 --> 14:36.200
He booked 90, fish killer.

14:36.234 --> 14:38.501
Hey, buddy, you need
a quarter? I got it.

14:50.167 --> 14:53.367
Hey, Tone, I got these two
tickets to the Islanders' game.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.901
I know how you really...

14:58.434 --> 15:00.634
Oh, he's
really grieving.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.300
I remember when our dog
Bootsie died.

15:03.334 --> 15:06.634
I was devastated
for years.

15:06.667 --> 15:07.968
How many?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.434
So far... 12.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.501
You know, Alex,
this is really too much.

15:19.534 --> 15:22.000
I mean, I know
I made a mistake--

15:22.033 --> 15:23.367
A big mistake.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.667
I mean, I really feel lousy

15:24.701 --> 15:26.334
about what happened
to Tony's fish.

15:26.367 --> 15:29.000
I mean I hate myself
when I do things like that--

15:29.033 --> 15:32.000
forgetting things,
not coming through for people,

15:32.033 --> 15:34.901
but jeez, how many times
do I have to apologize?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.667
Now, if he doesn't
want to be my friend,
well, that's fine with me.

15:37.701 --> 15:40.200
That's great, that's great.
It's over. Who needs him?

15:40.234 --> 15:41.434
You want me to talk to him?

15:41.467 --> 15:43.033
Would you, please?

15:43.067 --> 15:44.501
Yeah.

15:44.534 --> 15:47.033
Listen, why don't you tell
him to come over to my place

15:47.067 --> 15:48.501
and we'll sit down,
have some beers,

15:48.534 --> 15:50.701
and spend the evening together
and talk it out, okay?

15:50.734 --> 15:52.033
Okay.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.868
Oh, would you come with him?

15:53.901 --> 15:55.167
Yeah.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.701
Hey, Tony.

15:58.734 --> 15:59.968
Hey, Al.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.300
Listen,
Bobby's really hurting.

16:01.334 --> 16:02.634
He wants to patch it up.

16:02.667 --> 16:03.934
What do you say?

16:03.968 --> 16:05.300
I don't know, Alex.

16:05.334 --> 16:06.801
I mean, he really let me down.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.100
It's not just the fish.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.100
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

16:09.133 --> 16:10.767
Well, look, he's really
sorry for what he did.

16:10.801 --> 16:11.801
I mean, what could it hurt?

16:11.834 --> 16:12.968
You two sit down,
talk it out...

16:13.000 --> 16:14.200
Alex, I'm telling you--

16:14.234 --> 16:15.634
he really let me down this time.

16:15.667 --> 16:16.801
It ain't right.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.534
I'm not going to let him
get away with it.

16:19.567 --> 16:21.567
Look, he just wants you
to come over to his place

16:21.601 --> 16:22.901
and talk about it, that's all.

16:22.934 --> 16:24.167
Oh, yeah?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.067
Give me one good reason
why I should.

16:28.033 --> 16:32.334
Because I think the fish
would want it that way.

16:34.701 --> 16:36.701
I guess you're right.

16:45.901 --> 16:47.300
Hey, we're a little early.

16:47.334 --> 16:48.901
He's probably
out buying food.

16:48.934 --> 16:50.868
You know, this is
a first for Bobby.

16:50.901 --> 16:52.300
When he comes to my place,

16:52.334 --> 16:55.701
not only doesn't he bring stuff,
he usually takes stuff home.

16:55.734 --> 16:57.400
Like once, he took a lamp.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.634
That one.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.300
Hey, there's a couple
of beers in here.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.434
You want one?

17:03.467 --> 17:04.434
Yeah.

17:04.467 --> 17:05.968
I can't believe this guy.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.467
He borrows stuff;
he never gives it back.

17:08.501 --> 17:10.634
There's my dumbbells,
there's my football

17:10.666 --> 17:11.968
and that's my clock.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.133
Well, he doesn't mean
anything by it.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.601
He's just forgetful.
That's the way he is.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.434
Yeah, but that's what
I'm talking about.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.968
I mean, you take Bobby--

17:19.000 --> 17:21.634
he treats me creepy,
he ignores me

17:21.666 --> 17:23.166
calls me stupid.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.300
I mean, what do I like him for?

17:25.334 --> 17:29.167
I mean, there are guys I don't
even like that treat me better.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.667
One guy I hate
treats me almost as good.

17:31.701 --> 17:33.334
I mean, what is it, Alex?

17:33.367 --> 17:35.367
I don't Tony. I don't know
what makes people friends.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.667
Hey...

17:36.701 --> 17:38.000
Look.

17:38.033 --> 17:40.000
He kept them two phonies

17:40.033 --> 17:43.667
he was trying to pass off
as George and Wanda.

17:43.701 --> 17:44.934
Poor little guys.

17:44.968 --> 17:48.000
I wonder if they know
their days are numbered.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.334
It's a dog's life.

17:49.367 --> 17:50.667
He makes me so mad

17:50.701 --> 17:53.000
I'd like to destroy
something of his.

17:53.033 --> 17:55.000
Something that
he really cares about

17:55.033 --> 17:57.000
so he'd know how I feel.

17:57.033 --> 17:58.267
His lucky shirt.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.434
Hey, Tony, don't.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.434
The one he wears
to all his auditions.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.467
Tony, you're going
to regret this...

18:02.501 --> 18:03.801
I'm ripping off a sleeve.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.133
No, no, don't...
don't... don't!

18:05.167 --> 18:07.300
Hey, man, let me go!

18:07.334 --> 18:08.801
I can't.

18:08.834 --> 18:09.567
I knew you couldn't.

18:10.534 --> 18:13.767
Gee, I just remembered--
it's my shirt.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.067
You know, even if it wasn't my
shirt, man,

18:16.100 --> 18:17.834
I couldn't have done it anyway.

18:17.868 --> 18:19.434
I mean, it's like you said--

18:19.467 --> 18:22.901
a guy can do what he can do, and
he can't do what he can't do,

18:22.934 --> 18:25.100
so if a guy doesn't do
what he can't do,

18:25.133 --> 18:26.567
what are you going to do?

18:33.667 --> 18:35.501
I said that?

18:37.667 --> 18:39.701
( <i>laughter</i> )

18:50.033 --> 18:51.334
( <i>clears throat</i> )

18:51.367 --> 18:54.133
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

18:54.167 --> 18:55.667
What are we doing here?

18:55.701 --> 18:57.968
You begged me to have Tony
come over here

18:58.000 --> 18:59.267
so you two
could sit down...

18:59.300 --> 19:00.601
Oh, no.

19:00.634 --> 19:02.934
Oh, no... was that tonight?

19:02.968 --> 19:05.934
Oh, geez, Tony,
I'm really sorry.

19:05.968 --> 19:07.901
How can I do this?

19:07.934 --> 19:09.300
I'll tell you how.

19:09.334 --> 19:11.567
Because you are irresponsible,
inconsiderate, undependable...

19:11.601 --> 19:12.801
Maybe I should leave.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.968
No, no, no,
Dominique, listen...

19:15.000 --> 19:17.501
Would you mind
just waiting in the bedroom?

19:17.534 --> 19:19.567
Open the door,
down the hall...

19:19.601 --> 19:21.634
it's nice to see
you again, Tony.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.667
Yeah. How's your cousin?

19:22.701 --> 19:24.634
She had
any good fights lately?

19:24.667 --> 19:25.968
No, not lately.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.067
See you.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.334
Where was I?

19:30.367 --> 19:31.467
"Undependable."

19:31.501 --> 19:32.601
Right!

19:32.634 --> 19:34.000
Undependable, selfish,
insensitive...

19:34.033 --> 19:35.000
Hey, Alex?
Huh?

19:35.033 --> 19:36.167
Don't be so hard on him.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.801
He don't mean it.
He just forgets.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.968
How can you defend him?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.767
He killed
your fish!

19:41.801 --> 19:44.934
I murdered George and Wendy.

19:44.968 --> 19:46.167
George and Wanda!

19:46.200 --> 19:48.434
Wanda! The least you could do is
get their names straight! Wanda!

19:48.467 --> 19:49.167
Wanda...
Wanda.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.000
Don't be so hard on him.

19:51.033 --> 19:52.534
People are what they are.
You said it.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.667
Yeah, and I'm damn mad and
that's the way I am!

19:54.701 --> 19:55.834
And not just at him

19:55.868 --> 19:57.367
because you're just as
much to blame as he is.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.334
I mean, it's not as if
you didn't know

19:59.367 --> 20:00.667
how irresponsible he was.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.267
But you put your fish
in the hands of a man

20:02.300 --> 20:03.834
who can't even feed himself
half the time!

20:03.868 --> 20:06.000
Are you saying <i>I</i> had something
to do with killing my own fish?

20:06.033 --> 20:07.033
That's right!

20:07.067 --> 20:08.334
Hey, that's a crummy remark,
man.

20:08.367 --> 20:09.467
I think you should
take that back...

20:09.501 --> 20:10.501
Take it back? Why?

20:10.534 --> 20:11.501
It's true!
What are you talking about?

20:11.534 --> 20:12.501
I didn't kill my own fish.

20:12.534 --> 20:13.534
You know him!
Don't you?

20:13.567 --> 20:15.534
How can you possibly
put your fish in the...

20:15.567 --> 20:18.534
( <i>all arguing</i> )

20:18.567 --> 20:20.167
What do you want?!

20:20.200 --> 20:24.701
Listen, it's me
you're mad at, remember?

20:24.734 --> 20:26.200
Yeah.

20:26.234 --> 20:28.300
( <i>Alex chuckles</i> )

20:28.334 --> 20:30.133
It's... it's... it's...

20:30.167 --> 20:32.367
( <i>Alex chuckling</i> )

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
( <i>all chuckling</i> )

20:36.734 --> 20:39.300
Wendy, Wanda.

20:39.334 --> 20:40.701
Oh...

20:40.734 --> 20:42.701
I love you guys.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.033
I can't believe this.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.367
Hey, listen.
Grab your coats.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.067
I'm going to take you out
for a steak dinner tonight.

20:48.100 --> 20:52.067
Steak and Lowenbrau--
just like the commercial.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.601
Wheeler...

20:53.634 --> 20:54.901
You're a genius.

20:54.934 --> 20:56.200
Yeah.

20:56.234 --> 20:58.334
And after dinner,
I know this scalper.

20:58.367 --> 21:01.501
He's going to get us three
tickets to the Knicks' game.

21:01.534 --> 21:02.667
Okay? Let's go.

21:02.701 --> 21:04.334
Let's go.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.000
Oh, my God.

21:06.033 --> 21:07.334
Huh?

21:07.367 --> 21:09.667
( <i>stammering</i> )

21:09.701 --> 21:10.667
Oh.

21:10.701 --> 21:11.834
Oh.

21:11.868 --> 21:14.000
I'm... just going to
have to tell Dominique

21:14.033 --> 21:16.767
that I'm spending the
evening with you guys.

21:16.801 --> 21:18.067
Hey, listen, Bobby...

21:18.100 --> 21:19.334
No, no, no, Alex...

21:19.367 --> 21:21.334
Alex, this is very
important to me.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.367
Now I said
we're going out tonight

21:23.400 --> 21:24.701
and I'm sticking to it.

21:24.734 --> 21:27.701
I got to stop
letting people down like this.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.701
From now on,
when I say something

21:29.734 --> 21:31.901
I'm going to do it,
and that's that!

21:31.934 --> 21:34.067
Hey, Bobby,
that's really great...

21:34.100 --> 21:35.367
No, no, no, man...

21:35.400 --> 21:37.701
I said we're going out
and we're going.

21:37.734 --> 21:41.200
and we're going to have
a great time too.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.200
Just give me a second.

21:43.234 --> 21:45.367
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.334
( <i>sighs</i> )

21:49.534 --> 21:51.367
That was funny.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.067
( <i>both chuckling</i> )

21:58.701 --> 22:00.701
Oh, boy.

22:15.033 --> 22:18.033
( <i>whistling</i> )

22:36.000 --> 22:36.868
Hey!

22:41.734 --> 22:43.167
( <i>whistles</i> )

22:50.400 --> 22:52.400
( <i>mumbling</i> )

23:20.868 --> 23:24.000
Hey, Alex,
I got to do something.

23:24.033 --> 23:25.667
No, no, Tony, don't!

23:25.701 --> 23:28.033
There you go, guys.

23:35.067 --> 23:37.534
Hey, can I have your attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?

23:37.567 --> 23:39.267
I have a presentation to make.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.100
For my best friend, Tony.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.434
For me?

23:49.901 --> 23:53.033
That's the most beautiful
thing I ever saw.

23:53.067 --> 23:55.534
He got my fish mounted.
