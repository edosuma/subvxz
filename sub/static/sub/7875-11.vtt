00:05.038 --> 00:07.370
# Good morning, U.S.A. #

00:07.474 --> 00:11.069
# I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day #

00:11.177 --> 00:14.078
#The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face #

00:14.180 --> 00:17.946
#And he's shining a salute
to the American race #

00:20.620 --> 00:23.714
# Oh, boy
it's swell to say #

00:23.823 --> 00:26.758
<i># Good morning, U.S.A. #</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:31.926
<i>#Good morning, U.S.A. ##</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:37.560
<i>- Hello, Hercules.
- Opa! Francine!</i>

00:37.670 --> 00:39.900
- What you want?
- Stan's been on a big mission...

00:40.006 --> 00:41.906
and he gets home tonight.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.442
I want to do something
special, like prime rib.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.104
No, no, no, no, no.
A man- he want lamb.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.113
I give you four kinds of lamb.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.115
Well, you never steer me wrong.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.186
That's because I want you
and Stan to be so happy.

00:54.287 --> 00:56.585
Marriage was such
a beautiful thing for me...

00:56.689 --> 01:00.386
until my wife put her bike on the front
of the bus and the driver no see her.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.893
But I see her- every night...

01:02.996 --> 01:05.430
when I close my eyes,
with her many beautiful moles.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.501
<i>And I think, " Why, Athena? Why?"</i>

01:08.601 --> 01:11.468
But I'm ready to move on. I'm out there.
I just bought Rollerblades.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.471
Oh, Hercules.
You'll find someone.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.235
Yes! You make me believe.
Lamb is on the house.

01:16.342 --> 01:19.573
No, no. I can't do that. I got caught up
in moment. You pay me now.

01:19.679 --> 01:22.876
Horny, I'm home. L-
I mean, honey, I'm horny.

01:22.982 --> 01:25.041
L- I mean, Francine, I'm horny.

01:25.151 --> 01:27.051
Oh, Stan, I missed you.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.121
And I'm horny.

01:30.590 --> 01:34.458
Oh, Stan, don't ever put
a bike on the front of a bus.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.928
<i>Don't worry, baby. The bus is for foreigners.</i>

01:38.031 --> 01:39.931
Hello? Mama!

01:40.033 --> 01:43.628
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Stay right there. I'm coming, Mama.

01:43.736 --> 01:46.534
Mama's new boyfriend just left her.
Can you imagine?

01:46.639 --> 01:49.574
Yes! Because it happens,
like, three times a year.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.576
Three being the average.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.203
Steve taught me averages
with cupcakes.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.981
There, there, Mama. You don't need him.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.522
- Jerry's a jerk.
- I don't understand.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.286
We had such a good time
on our first two dates.

02:07.393 --> 02:11.193
Then we were at the movies. He went
to get popcorn and never came back.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.492
Oh, I had to watch
the whole thing by myself.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.058
Adam Sandler had a remote control.
I didn't know what was happening.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.367
To hell with Jerry.
Any guy would be lucky to have you.

02:20.473 --> 02:24.000
This happens with every
gentleman I see socially.

02:24.110 --> 02:26.203
Maybe I'm just unlovable.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.212
- Fishing.
- What's that, dear?

02:28.314 --> 02:31.750
- You're fishing!
- Francine! My mother's very vulnerable right now.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.513
Every guy she goes out with
dumps her on the third date.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.521
And why wouldn't they?
She's all dried up.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.648
Her uterus is an abandoned theater.

02:38.758 --> 02:41.056
Nothing in there but
old playbills and memories.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.358
- Some say there's a phantom
that only comes out at night.

02:44.464 --> 02:48.025
Shh, shh, shh. Don't be scared.
It's just a legend.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.159
Is Grandma still sad?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.467
There's the matter of two bounced
$10 Christmas checks to attend to.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.734
Nope. Still milking it.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.709
Oh, Stan.
At least I have you.

02:58.811 --> 03:01.371
You'll always be my number one man.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.574
And you're my number one gal.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.173
What about me?

03:05.285 --> 03:07.685
Francine, I can't
put a number on you.

03:07.787 --> 03:10.221
<i>But you're definitely
woman " B" in my life.</i>

03:13.726 --> 03:17.958
Yes, about six foot, blonde, stacked,
not afraid to get down with a fish.

03:18.064 --> 03:21.056
Oh, and this is very important.
She must be nine months pregnant.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.192
Hello?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.931
Klaus, were you just ordering a hooker
from the yellow pages?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.735
Oh, no, no. I was just,
um, looking to see...

03:28.841 --> 03:31.605
if there was a plumber
in the area who could-

03:31.711 --> 03:33.975
Yes! Yes!

03:34.080 --> 03:36.014
I'm so lonely!

03:36.115 --> 03:39.312
I haven't felt the touch of another
human being in six years.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.944
I just want to be held.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.989
There, there.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.581
- You're not alone.
- Oh.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.355
Thank you, Steve.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.625
Here's a $100 bill. Don't look at me,
because I won't look at you.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.106
Oh, look who's got tickets
for the gun show. Ka-pow!

04:07.680 --> 04:09.773
I cannot go back down there.

04:09.882 --> 04:13.477
Stan's mom is here after
being dumped for the billionth time.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.679
Oh, Betty's here?
I love her.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.985
You don't even know her.
Every time she visits, you're plastered.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.550
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.755
Oh.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.891
Tacos!

04:28.001 --> 04:30.128
Who's crying?

04:30.236 --> 04:33.103
So I've had a drink in my life.
But I'm sober now.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.107
This is my white month.
Thirty days with no alcohol.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.440
Just clean living.
Got the idea from the Swedes.

04:39.545 --> 04:43.003
Amazing people,
unbelievably shoddy furniture.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.550
Now, who does Betty know me as?

04:45.652 --> 04:48.348
Cousin Phil, number 302.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.496
God, that woman's manipulative.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.127
She uses her personal drama
as an excuse to come here...

05:04.237 --> 05:07.070
take over Stan's life
and elbow me out.

05:07.173 --> 05:10.574
Threatened by the visiting
mother-in-law. Cliché!

05:10.677 --> 05:14.306
Ah, you don't know what you're
talking about. They are way too close.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.814
Francine, this is all in your head.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.578
<i>Just like my wedding to Valerie Harper
was all in my head.</i>

05:19.686 --> 05:21.586
Okay, Roger. You're right.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.418
Stan and his mother's relationship
is perfectly normal.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.424
You know, I have a headache.

05:26.526 --> 05:29.586
You mind going to my medicine cabinet
and getting some aspirin?

05:29.696 --> 05:33.928
Ooh! Stairs! Give me a chance
to blast my calves. Ka-boom!

05:34.033 --> 05:38.402
Ba-bam. Ba-boom.
Ba-bam. Ba-boom.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.529
<i># What do you do
when your mom's unhappy #</i>

05:40.640 --> 05:42.540
#Jerry left her
feeling crappy #

05:42.642 --> 05:46.100
# Sing her a chantey, nice and snappy
Wash her in the bathtub #

05:46.212 --> 05:49.579
<i># Wash, wash, wash your V.J.
Scrub, scrub, scrub your V.J. #</i>

05:49.682 --> 05:53.049
<i># Rinse, rinse, rinse your V.J.
Next we'll do your tushy #</i>

05:53.152 --> 05:56.588
#Wash, wash, wash your tushy
Scrub, scrub, scrub your tushy #

05:56.689 --> 06:00.386
<i># Rinse, rinse, rinse your tushy
Wejust did your tushy ##</i>

06:05.732 --> 06:07.632
I told you it was complicated.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.931
No. No. No. Changing planes
at O'Hare is complicated.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.131
Th-This is-
This is just-

06:14.240 --> 06:18.643
- Frannie, what is this?
- Well, it all started when Stan was a little boy...

06:18.745 --> 06:20.713
<i>and his father left them.</i>

06:25.718 --> 06:28.482
- Is it my fault?
- Stan, look at me.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.422
Kind of.

06:32.525 --> 06:36.655
- Don't worry, Mama. I'll take care of you.
- I know you will.

06:38.698 --> 06:41.326
That's my little man Stan.

06:41.434 --> 06:45.336
<i>So, from that moment on,
Betty relied on Stan for everything.</i>

06:45.438 --> 06:47.998
She tried to find love,
but it never worked out.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.735
And Stan was always
the pillow she'd cry on.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.811
So, have you talked
to Stan about this?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.506
I've tried. But he doesn't think
there's a problem.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.914
Well, we'll talk to him together.
I'll make him see there's a problem.

06:59.018 --> 07:02.715
Too close to my mother?
How dare you! I'm all she's got!

07:02.822 --> 07:05.655
Yeah, Francine. This is the man's mother,
for God's sake.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.194
- What is wrong with her?
- But you were the one who said we should talk to him.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.162
Yeah. About the possibility of
switching from cable to dish.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.665
I didn't know I was gonna get
dragged into your psychodrama.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.726
- I vote dish, by the way.
- Francine, my mother is not manipulating me.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.829
Our relationship
is completely normal.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.808
And if you keep upsetting me, then I'll have to
retreat to my safe place between her breasts.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.676
- Roger, what the hell?
- Yeah, I panicked.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.942
Listen, talking to Stan
is the wrong way to go.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.314
- But you said-
- Yeah, keep interrupting. That's helpful.

07:33.419 --> 07:36.980
Look, until Betty gets a man of her own,
she won't let go of Stan.

07:37.089 --> 07:41.082
But she's a disaster at picking men.
So we pick one for her.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.321
One who won't blow her off
after three dates.

07:43.429 --> 07:47.058
Roger, that's a great idea.
And I know the perfect guy.

07:47.166 --> 07:51.068
Fantastic. All I ask in return
is that you vote with me on the dish.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.229
Wait. Did I make that up,
or is that real?

07:53.339 --> 07:55.864
Is there even a vote?
I don't know what's real.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.741
Oh, man. This is not gonna be fun.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.746
Hey, Steve.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.214
<i>- Hey, Klaus. What's up?
- Ja, this is Klaus.</i>

08:04.317 --> 08:06.217
- How's it going?
- Good.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.844
Okay. Look. Um...

08:08.955 --> 08:11.753
I don't know if you remember,
but you picked me up a while back.

08:11.858 --> 08:15.089
Look, there's no easy way to say this.
I just found out that I have ich.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.458
- So you might have it too.
- Ich?

08:17.563 --> 08:21.465
<i>- Isn't that a fish disease?
- Ja. So I'm just trying to be responsible.</i>

08:21.567 --> 08:23.865
- I'm calling everyone I've been with to-
- Everyone?

08:23.970 --> 08:25.995
You told me you hadn't
been touched in six years.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.539
Yeah. And you took the hundred dollars.
No one's a saint here.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.735
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah. Well, I'll let you go.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.336
- You probably have some calls
to make yourself. Sorry.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.076
This is gonna be a tough one.

08:39.118 --> 08:41.018
Carlos...

08:41.120 --> 08:44.054
when you were at your cousin's
funeral in Valparaiso...

08:44.155 --> 08:46.056
I had sex with Cynthia.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.722
Francine, Stan's coming home soon.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.198
- He needs me to be there to greet him.
- This'll take one second.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.531
<i>Opa! Francine!
How was the lamb?</i>

08:57.637 --> 09:00.606
Oh, you got the lamb here.
I thought it was a little fatty.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.707
Hercules, I'm sorry.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.743
- She doesn't know what she's-
- No. She is right.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.813
It was not good lamb.
I wrestled morally...

09:07.914 --> 09:11.441
but the man who bring it is my sister's
husband, so I sell shoddy lamb.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.985
You know your lamb, lady.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.384
- I am Hercules.
- I'm Betty.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.321
I would love to talk more
about the lamb.

09:23.429 --> 09:26.330
Say, over lamb?

09:27.900 --> 09:31.063
We are laughing about lamb.
We are living!

09:34.173 --> 09:36.573
<i>So the woman- she say, " No deal. "</i>

09:36.676 --> 09:39.804
Then she opened her own case,
and inside was only a penny.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.370
- No!
- Yes! She give up $70,000.

09:43.482 --> 09:46.451
- I would die.
- Don't die. Kiss me.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.850
Deal.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.355
- Oh, my God! They're kissing!
- I know! I know! I know!

09:53.459 --> 09:55.757
You ever notice how Rolos
make you drool?

09:55.861 --> 09:58.421
- What's going on?
- Stan, now don't be upset...

09:58.531 --> 10:00.931
but I set your mother up
with Hercules.

10:01.033 --> 10:04.400
No. It's too soon.
Poor woman just had her heart broken.

10:04.503 --> 10:07.995
Don't you get it?
She's as raw as the Wu-Tang Clan like it.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.803
Oh, Francine, Hercules is wonderful.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.810
We're going out again
tomorrow night.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.937
I hope this one sticks.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.015
I hope it does too, Mama.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.607
Anything goes wrong with this guy,
it's your fault.

10:19.719 --> 10:24.554
Oh, what could go wrong? They're both lonely.
They both like each other.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.557
You're a fool,
and I'll tell you why.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.787
Grandma Chase-'Em-Away
always blows it on the third date.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.295
So, ta-da!

10:32.398 --> 10:35.060
- You stole her address book?
- That's right.

10:35.167 --> 10:39.069
I'm gonna call up Betty's previous suitors
and find out what sent them all running.

10:39.171 --> 10:42.572
That way we can coach her
so she doesn't screw things up with Hercules.

10:42.675 --> 10:46.702
Yep. We're gonna teach that lady
how to please a man.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.250
Oh, I wasn't making a point.
I was just low on potassium.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.789
I can't believe my stupid friends
won't hang out with me.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.689
I told them, as long as they don't
touch me, they can't get ich.

11:01.794 --> 11:04.024
Oh, they are totally uncool, Steve.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.030
Oh, look. I'm getting married.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.864
Steve, no. Don't give me
a boy bride. L-

11:10.970 --> 11:13.530
Oh, you're teasing me.

11:13.639 --> 11:17.075
You're insinuating I'm gay
because I'm marrying a boy.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.270
Salacious!

11:26.052 --> 11:28.213
Francine. Thank God.
I've been waiting for you.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.154
- Roger?
- Meet me in the attic. I have something important to show you.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.823
Morning.
I was just... in there.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.369
Oh, look.
Here's some bologna.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.439
I, uh-

11:49.208 --> 11:51.870
I've been up all night
doing research.

11:51.977 --> 11:55.743
You know Betty's boyfriends,
the ones who keep leaving her?

11:55.848 --> 11:57.941
Well, they're not leaving her.
They're disappearing.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.451
<i>Missing. Missing.
Missing. Missing. Missing.</i>

12:01.554 --> 12:04.648
Me buying chocolate in Solvang.
Missing. Missing.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.692
- I don't understand.
- They're not breaking up with her.

12:07.793 --> 12:12.287
Betty Smith is a black widow.
She dates, and then... she kills!

12:12.398 --> 12:15.890
<i>- What? That's crazy.
- No. She's crazy.</i>

12:16.001 --> 12:18.663
Think about it. She lives
for her son's attention.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.899
What better way to get it
than by constantly being dumped?

12:22.007 --> 12:25.135
- We have to tell Stan.
- But he'll never believe us.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.509
He'll have to believe us.
We have proof.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.514
My mother is a killer?

12:30.616 --> 12:33.710
Stan, I know this is hard to hear,
but we have proof.

12:33.819 --> 12:37.016
- Roger.
- I don't know what she's talking about, Stan.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.489
First you say my mother
and I are too close.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.492
Then you accuse her
of being a killer.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.926
Will you stop at nothing
to drive a wedge between us?

12:44.029 --> 12:46.293
No, Stan.
Look at the evidence.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.464
I don't have time
for your craziness.

12:50.569 --> 12:53.902
- Roger!
- I'm sorry, Francine. He's a big, scary man.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.133
Plus his mother kills
men and eats them.

12:56.242 --> 12:59.609
- She eats them?
- No. It's called exaggeration, and we all do it.

12:59.712 --> 13:03.148
Oh, my God.
We have to warn Hercules.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.612
- Klaus, where's Betty?
- Hercules just picked her up.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.654
They went to
Les Pantalons Fancie for dinner.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.315
Francine, they're on date number three!

13:12.424 --> 13:15.552
- We have to go save Hercules.
- And we have to go in disguise.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.822
Right. 'Cause otherwise
Betty would recognize us.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.830
I guess, if you need a reason.

13:19.932 --> 13:23.026
I just need to justify my dry-cleaning
carousel to my accountant.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.571
- You have an accountant?
- I have an accountant costume.

13:31.944 --> 13:34.708
What's going on? I can't hardly see.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.805
They seem to be having a good time.

13:36.916 --> 13:41.410
What is her plan?
How is she gonna do this in a public place?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.715
That guy's big head's in my way.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.950
Hey, Easter Island.
Move your fat head.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.652
- Shh!
- Oh, I know you didn't just shush me.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.854
Ooh! Look, girl.
He's going to the bathroom.

13:59.338 --> 14:03.570
<i>And she's following him. She's right behind
you. Do not go in there, " Hercule"!</i>

14:03.676 --> 14:07.840
That poor man. This is all my fault.
We've gotta go save him.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.006
I agree. Right after
my soufflé comes...

14:10.115 --> 14:12.743
I will join you,
and we will save him.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.752
Mmm. Mmm, mmm!

14:14.854 --> 14:17.345
What's this? Honey butter?
That's a good roll.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.391
Hercules, I'm coming!

14:32.805 --> 14:34.932
Betty!

14:37.676 --> 14:39.541
It's over, Betty.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.070
Stan!

14:44.917 --> 14:46.885
Francine, I can explain.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.386
<i>She's my mommy!</i>

14:51.123 --> 14:55.389
So for 35 years you've been
killing your mother's dates?

14:55.494 --> 14:58.327
No. I've been abducting them
and dumping them on an uncharted island.

14:58.430 --> 15:01.729
Killing them. You've seen too many movies.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.734
<i>After my father left us...</i>

15:03.836 --> 15:05.804
<i>my mother was devastated.</i>

15:06.972 --> 15:08.872
<i>I was all she had...</i>

15:08.974 --> 15:11.909
<i>- and I did everything I could to keep her happy.
- Oh!</i>

15:13.946 --> 15:16.506
<i>But then she started dating again.</i>

15:16.615 --> 15:19.641
<i>And I knew these men wouldjust
break her heart, like my father did.</i>

15:19.752 --> 15:23.279
<i>So I did what any rational loving son would do.</i>

15:23.389 --> 15:27.587
<i>When they took her out,
I took them out.</i>

15:49.648 --> 15:53.345
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I have an amazing capacity for love.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.511
Anyway, gotta go kidnap a Greek guy.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.521
Stan, come back!

15:58.691 --> 16:01.216
<i>- Where's my mom and Hercules?
- Mmm, mmm!</i>

16:01.327 --> 16:04.296
I might lose my toes to diabetes,
but it was worth it.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.921
- Roger, where's Betty?
- Oh, she left with the Greek.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.899
I guess there was some craziness
in the bathroom, and he was all like...

16:10.002 --> 16:11.936
<i>" Life's too short.
I'm taking my lady to Greece. "</i>

16:12.037 --> 16:14.301
<i>And she was like,
"Oh, my God. I was so scared...</i>

16:14.406 --> 16:16.670
you weren't gonna come back
from the bathroom. I love you. "

16:16.775 --> 16:19.801
<i>Then he yelled, " Oprah!" and I dropped
a peppermint, and I missed the rest.</i>

16:19.912 --> 16:22.346
Oh, my God!
He's taking her to Greece!

16:22.448 --> 16:25.542
- I'm coming, Mama!
- Stan!

16:29.922 --> 16:32.584
- We need to get to the airport.
- You go. I gotta get home.

16:32.691 --> 16:35.159
I got term papers to grade.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.854
Klaus, guess what.
I went online...

16:37.963 --> 16:39.988
and found out
there's a cure for ich.

16:40.099 --> 16:42.192
You can buy it
at any pet store. Look.

16:42.301 --> 16:46.499
A cure! Hooray!
I had no idea.

16:46.605 --> 16:50.598
That is something of which
I am just now learning.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.700
Oh, my God. You knew.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.745
You knew there was a cure for ich.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.146
What? That-That-That-That's crazy.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.344
Why would I infect you
and not tell you there's a cure?

17:01.453 --> 17:03.353
So- So your friends
would shun you...

17:03.455 --> 17:06.891
and you'd be forced to come home early
and spend time with me for a change?

17:09.127 --> 17:12.689
How absurd!
Listen to how crazy absurd you sound.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.925
Do you want to make cookies with me?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.731
That's exactly why you did it!
You're sick.

17:18.837 --> 17:21.305
You're sick!

17:21.406 --> 17:24.069
Get out!
Go back to your world!

17:28.380 --> 17:30.280
Klaus, what's wrong?

17:31.383 --> 17:34.113
Oh, nothing.
It's- It's just...

17:34.219 --> 17:38.246
I haven't felt the touch of another
human being in six years.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.450
Oh, you poor thing.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.964
Fish can't get herpes, can they?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.932
All right.
What's the fastest way to the airport?

17:50.035 --> 17:52.469
Should I take the freeway,
or should I take surface streets?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.471
Surface streets or freeway?

17:54.573 --> 17:57.098
Surface streets or freeway?
Surface streets or freeway?

17:57.209 --> 17:59.109
- Freeway.
- Surface streets!

18:01.747 --> 18:04.215
Damn it!
Come on. It's green.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.807
I need to make this light.
Get off your phone.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.285
I have to-
And now it's red. Oh, bravo. Bravo.

18:10.722 --> 18:14.351
- Has the 8:00 to Athens left yet?
- They're boarding now.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.862
<i>Excuse me. Trying to merge.</i>

18:18.964 --> 18:21.228
<i>Not trying to get ahead of anybody.
Just merging.</i>

18:21.333 --> 18:23.267
<i>This isn't a contest.</i>

18:23.368 --> 18:26.599
<i>Fuck you! Fine.
I'll take the shoulder.</i>

18:26.705 --> 18:28.730
<i>Excuse me.
Trying to merge. L-I'm just trying-</i>

18:28.841 --> 18:30.308
<i>Fuck you!</i>

18:41.420 --> 18:43.684
I'm coming, Mama.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.982
Oh, okay.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.391
First time peeing in an airplane.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.398
You're a little nervous.
There's no shame in that. Just relax and-

19:00.472 --> 19:02.633
Sir, may I see your ticket?

19:02.741 --> 19:05.539
Blanket? Blanket? Blanket?

19:05.644 --> 19:08.374
Francine?
But how did you- Freeway!

19:08.480 --> 19:12.075
Stan, this is ridiculous.
You have to leave your mother alone.

19:12.184 --> 19:15.745
I will-just as soon as I ditch Hercules
on a deserted island.

19:15.854 --> 19:19.153
<i>Attention, everyone. Let's all give a big opa...</i>

19:19.258 --> 19:22.250
<i>to Betty and Hercules,
who'vejust decided to get married!</i>

19:22.361 --> 19:25.194
<i>- Opa!
- Mmm.</i>

19:25.297 --> 19:27.857
- No.
- You see, Stan?

19:27.966 --> 19:31.663
Look how happy she is. There was a time
when you two needed each other...

19:31.770 --> 19:33.670
but she's moved on...

19:33.772 --> 19:35.933
and you have to do the same.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.202
Let her go.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.211
- Or I can stab him in the neck.
- No!

19:44.316 --> 19:46.045
Don't touch my mommy.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.886
What do you think you're doing, young man?

19:49.988 --> 19:53.924
- Saving you.
- Saving me? I don't need to be saved.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.722
- But, Mama-
- You've been the perfect son...

19:56.828 --> 20:00.764
but I finally have a chance at happiness,
and I'm taking it.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.356
But what about me?

20:02.467 --> 20:05.766
Honey, you're the luckiest guy
in the world.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.169
You have a woman who loves you.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.537
- You?
- No! The wonderful woman...

20:10.642 --> 20:14.009
who's put up with us
for all these years.

20:18.483 --> 20:20.610
Now, I'm gonna need you
to sit back down...

20:20.719 --> 20:24.655
because there's an air marshal
pointing a gun at your head.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.986
Oh, hey. Look, I know I was
about to attempt murder...

20:27.092 --> 20:30.289
but it's cool, because I'm about to
reconcile emotionally with my wife.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.333
A toast to the happy couple.

20:36.435 --> 20:40.166
- And to my number one gal.
- Oh, Stan.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.570
<i>- Betty!
- Oh, that's so strange.</i>

20:42.674 --> 20:44.665
<i>- Betty!
- Sounds like someone shouting my name.</i>

20:44.776 --> 20:47.142
It's the call of the Greek sirens.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.680
They try to ensnare you
in their web of love.

20:49.781 --> 20:52.773
- I think it is working.
- Mmm.

20:52.884 --> 20:55.079
It's working on me too.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.281
<i>- Mmm.
- Betty!</i>

20:59.625 --> 21:01.183
<i>Betty! Betty!</i>

21:01.293 --> 21:03.193
Betty! Betty!

21:03.295 --> 21:05.786
Betty! Betty!
Betty, it's Benny! Betty. Betty, Betty.

21:05.897 --> 21:08.195
Betty, over here.

21:08.300 --> 21:12.134
Hey, you guys want to keep it down?
I'm trying to watch TV.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.137
I've gone crazy.

21:45.904 --> 21:47.804
Bye. Have a beautiful time.
