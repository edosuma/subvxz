00:28.328 --> 00:29.864
Hello, Wyatt.
I have a few questions

00:29.929 --> 00:32.101
before we complete your profile.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.606
Okay.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.113
Boxers or briefs?

00:40.073 --> 00:41.882
Boxers?

00:41.941 --> 00:43.545
Is your ass hairy?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.647
Well, it's not.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.886
I don't shave my ass
if that's what you mean.

00:48.948 --> 00:51.258
One last question.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.957
Would you rather bang a guy
or get banged by a guy?

00:54.020 --> 00:56.022
What?
I'm not answering that!

00:56.089 --> 00:59.195
So banged in the ass!

00:59.259 --> 01:00.533
I must be hearing things.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.184
Yeah, the summer sun's gone.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.059
So what do I do?

01:26.119 --> 01:28.793
Tryin' to move on,
I found someone new.

01:28.855 --> 01:31.927
But it's not you,
no, it's not you.

01:34.494 --> 01:37.134
And misery lives
down Memory Lane.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.905
When I go down the road
always feel the same.

01:39.966 --> 01:43.004
'Cause I miss you,
yeah, I miss you.

01:46.005 --> 01:50.283
To be without you
would be pain defined.

01:50.343 --> 01:53.916
And she might?

01:53.980 --> 01:58.656
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

02:00.019 --> 02:02.397
The magic.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.197
She might?

02:05.258 --> 02:09.434
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.711
The magic.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.302
In her eyes.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.452
Sitting in the room
under candlelight.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.086
Thinking you will never
find your Mr. Right.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.325
But it's not true,
no, it's not true.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.800
And you can be my princess,
I'll be your knight.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.499
My armor might be dirty
but my love still shines.

02:42.562 --> 02:46.032
Yes, it shines through,
yeah, it still shines through.

02:48.535 --> 02:52.847
To be with you
is happiness defined.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.319
And she might?

02:56.376 --> 03:00.256
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.895
The magic.

03:04.951 --> 03:07.795
She might?

03:07.854 --> 03:11.301
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.497
Wipe it off. So dirty.

03:14.561 --> 03:17.132
Oh, so dirty. Wipe it.

03:17.197 --> 03:21.236
Oh oh. Slow down.

03:21.301 --> 03:24.145
Oh oh oh yeah.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.946
Oh, too much for me to handle
I just...

03:32.612 --> 03:35.218
Okay, oh yes.
I'm open for a little negotiating.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.522
Ready for this? This is what
we've been training for, buddy.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.722
Ready?
Here we go, buddy.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.236
You pack up that
little thumbtack of yours

03:49.295 --> 03:53.004
and haul it on out of here
before I snap it off!

04:24.264 --> 04:26.870
This whole miniature golf course
is calling our names.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.607
Let's finish off this hole
so I can whup your ass!

04:29.669 --> 04:31.876
Oh, you wanna bet?

04:31.938 --> 04:34.509
Hey, it was my turn anyway!
See, that's what you get.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.180
I'm gonna bounce you out.
Oh, look at me, I just gave it to you

04:37.243 --> 04:39.621
I still give you the game,
just like when you were little!

04:42.315 --> 04:44.625
You need to find a nice girl
Maybe that'll cook for you

04:44.684 --> 04:46.561
and stop eating
all that fast food, okay?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.860
You know I go on
a lot of nice dates,

04:48.921 --> 04:51.162
but... I don't know.
We're having a party tonight

04:51.224 --> 04:53.067
and maybe I'll meet the one.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.936
What do you want?
You're almost 30 years old, Wyatt.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.271
You need to find yourself a girl
There's a reason why

04:58.331 --> 05:00.607
somebody's not married by
the time they're 30 years old.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.544
- Yeah? Why's that?
- Because they're fucking nuts!

05:02.602 --> 05:06.414
You don't want to be 40 and fat
and bald and not have somebody

05:06.472 --> 05:08.645
I mean, hey,
everybody wants to get some,

05:08.708 --> 05:12.713
but, you know... not everybody
can be Van Halen, you know.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.656
Huh? Van Halen?

05:14.714 --> 05:16.591
Yeah, guys that get some.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.858
No, they're all rock stars
and all bald by now, okay?

05:19.919 --> 05:22.331
They're not getting
any at all, so there.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.868
They may be bald,
but they've got bigger dicks than me.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.828
Yes, I know.
I've changed your diapers, okay?

05:27.894 --> 05:29.737
- I know what it's like...
- Oh ho ho!

05:29.796 --> 05:32.208
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I know you're not blessed.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.108
- You are not gifted, okay?
- Wow.

05:46.746 --> 05:49.192
It's hard to believe that.

05:49.248 --> 05:50.989
- Hey.
- Whassup, girl?

05:51.050 --> 05:52.996
Are you the guy with the stuff?

05:53.052 --> 05:55.054
Ha, no. I am not.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.362
There's a guy upstairs... Asian guy.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.528
He's got the stuff
you're probably looking for.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.538
Feel free to look around
check it out.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.631
- Cool, thanks.
- Do it.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.176
Do it.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.474
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:10.536 --> 06:14.245
- Big time, man.
- The party's a little out of control?

06:14.307 --> 06:16.309
Dude, what are you worried about?
Look at this.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.754
They're chilling, they're all having
a good time. It's a party.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.018
- You know what a party is, right?
- I do.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.526
Don't worry about it.
I got your house unlocked.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.085
We're good.
We're good. I'll be back.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.222
That scares me the most.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.103
Hi, is this your house?

06:37.163 --> 06:40.633
- Yeah.
- You want to show me around?

06:40.700 --> 06:43.203
- Uh...
- Hey, Ange, leave him alone, okay?

06:43.269 --> 06:45.215
You can't have every guy.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.217
We'll see about that.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.244
Okay, bye-bye.

06:51.310 --> 06:54.553
Hey, Angie, go find Kevin.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.616
He's the, uh

06:56.682 --> 06:58.059
dirty Asian guy.

06:59.385 --> 07:02.594
- Your friend is a lucky man.
- Really?

07:02.655 --> 07:05.795
You gotta do this to me.

07:05.858 --> 07:09.067
After all is said and done.

07:09.128 --> 07:12.632
Can we go back
to where we've begun?

07:12.698 --> 07:15.042
- Hey!
- Hey-yyy.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.375
Hi.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.746
- Are you Kevin?
- Well, if you're asking

07:18.805 --> 07:20.910
for the double-wide over there
then no, I'm Jason.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.288
I'm the one who's asking.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.791
Well, then you found me.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.589
You're kinda cute.

07:30.650 --> 07:33.426
Thanks.
You know I exfoliate

07:33.486 --> 07:35.693
and drink a lot of water...
what do you mean kinda?

07:35.755 --> 07:38.065
How about you show me
around your house?

07:40.026 --> 07:41.266
And what about you?

07:41.327 --> 07:43.739
Hmm, I'm sorry
I have morals.

07:43.796 --> 07:48.006
That's good, because I was just
about to give up on your kind.

07:48.067 --> 07:51.105
- Oh, off to the dark side, are we?
- "Dark side."

07:52.405 --> 07:53.406
Now that's funny

07:55.875 --> 07:57.877
I always get the worm,

07:57.944 --> 07:59.719
in more ways than one.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.123
I... I...

08:11.624 --> 08:13.968
Are you gonna offer me
some of that drink?

08:14.026 --> 08:16.370
Yeah, I'm... shit, I'm sorry
I'm not a very good host.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.672
Yeah, it totally confused me, because
normally gay guys are great hosts.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.978
- Let's play a game.
- Okay okay.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.682
First one to scream
takes a bodyshot.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.621
Uh, okay.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.687
- Here's one.
- That was a...

08:40.753 --> 08:42.357
okay, I guess it is my turn, huh?

08:42.421 --> 08:44.526
Uh-huh.
Suck it up, stud.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.035
- Can I have that...
- Yeah yeah.

08:50.730 --> 08:51.868
What the fuck?

08:51.931 --> 08:54.241
- How about another one?
- I don't like this game.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.439
- Go on!
- Well, I guess it's not that bad.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.311
- The game is...
- Oh yeah.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.556
Oh fuck!

09:06.612 --> 09:08.717
What, you can't hold
your liquor, you pussy?

09:08.781 --> 09:10.488
What? I wish your face
was your pussy.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.688
Uh-huh

09:12.752 --> 09:15.062
I want you inside me

09:15.121 --> 09:16.623
I don't have a condom.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.363
- I don't care, go in me.
- Okay.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.033
That's... this... oh.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.373
- That's the ticket.
- Ow. Where are you?

09:29.802 --> 09:31.213
You're not inside me.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.645
- What are you fucking?
- Uh, it's these sheets.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.814
They must be
a nice 1,000-thread count

09:38.878 --> 09:40.221
I mean, it felt good?

09:40.279 --> 09:42.259
I'm taking over.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.453
Oh, okay.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.266
- Oh yeah?
- Baby, I like it.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.165
Oh yeah?
How about this?

09:52.191 --> 09:54.193
Much better.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.968
- Is that?
- Huh, how do you like that?

09:57.029 --> 09:59.441
You little bitch!

09:59.498 --> 10:00.875
You like that?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.541
Dude...

10:05.671 --> 10:07.844
- Dude?
- What's up, fuckers?

10:07.907 --> 10:10.353
Has this stoner been
in here the entire time?

10:10.409 --> 10:12.719
Hey, man, can I get in
on some of this?

10:12.778 --> 10:15.520
Dude, what the hell
are you doing here?

10:15.581 --> 10:17.959
My mom had blonde hair too,
just like yours.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.759
In fact my dad was
Asian too, I think.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.135
Are you a real blonde?

10:25.191 --> 10:27.228
Get the hell out of here!

10:27.293 --> 10:29.034
All right, all right, chill out.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.097
All right, so, uh

10:31.163 --> 10:32.574
hey, forget it.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.943
Hey, I love you assholes.
Remember that, all right?

10:36.002 --> 10:36.701
You need a beat?
Catch me in the hood.

10:36.702 --> 10:37.840
You need a beat?
Catch me in the hood.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.504
See me in the street,
I got what you want

10:39.538 --> 10:41.745
I got what you need,
I'm in the black Lexus.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.218
Oh my God, get it off me!

10:43.275 --> 10:45.084
Oh my God!

10:45.144 --> 10:47.181
Dude, what the fuck
do you have all over you?

10:47.246 --> 10:49.692
- And what's that smell?
- Dude, I was fucking that chick...

10:49.749 --> 10:51.660
thank you, by the way
She's awesome.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.391
And we were going at it so good and I
was fucking her reverse cowboy, right?

10:54.453 --> 10:56.399
Like she was turned around
her ass facing you.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.296
Yeah, I know what
the reverse cowboy is, Kevin!

10:58.324 --> 11:00.684
All right, well, anyway,
I must have been doing her so good?

11:00.693 --> 11:03.139
Because all I remember
is she was screaming

11:03.195 --> 11:04.833
and I looked down

11:04.897 --> 11:06.501
dude, it's everywhere!

11:06.565 --> 11:10.172
- In my bed?!
- And all over me. It's everywhere!

11:10.236 --> 11:11.579
It's everywhere.

11:11.637 --> 11:15.016
Oh, are you just gonna
stay in bed all day?

11:15.074 --> 11:17.020
Or are you gonna do
something productive?

11:17.076 --> 11:20.489
Gimme a break. I didn't get home
from the bar until 4:00 in the morning.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.389
Yeah, I know.

11:22.448 --> 11:25.292
But I think that if you just
wake up a little earlier,

11:25.351 --> 11:28.332
- you might get more stuff done.
- Yeah, and do what?

11:28.387 --> 11:31.766
Let's see, clean the pool,
fix the barbecue!

11:34.293 --> 11:36.899
I am having a bachelorette party
here this weekend.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.644
I'm up now.
Are you happy?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.738
Why do you always
have to wait till the last minute

11:43.803 --> 11:45.339
to do everything?

11:45.404 --> 11:47.441
Okay, I'll do it now.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.419
But we have to have
a little fun time first.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.149
Yeah?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.782
Come on, we haven't touched
each other in a month.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.986
So jack off!
No one's stopping you.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.030
- No kiss bye?
- Mm-hmm.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.198
Love you.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.073
Thanks for coming.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.371
- You've always been there for me.
- Of course.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.540
- You know you're my best friend.
- I know.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.482
- You have it?
- Oh yeah!

12:20.539 --> 12:23.520
- Ta-da!
- Nice box.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.580
She definitely would have found that.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.682
Yeah, that would have been funny

12:29.882 --> 12:32.385
Wyatt, this is a huge step.

12:32.451 --> 12:35.330
It's big.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.367
Yeah, I know, but...

12:37.423 --> 12:40.404
I mean, it sounds like
you don't like the idea.

12:40.459 --> 12:42.632
No no, it's not that
She's great.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.038
Well then what?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.905
I'm not going to be able
to make it to dinner tonight?

12:45.965 --> 12:48.275
Yes, you will.
Just bring your dickhead boyfriend.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.177
- Hey!
- All right, but seriously though.

12:50.236 --> 12:53.547
I need you more than ever,
so I really need you to be there.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.745
- More than ever, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.189
- Okay.
- Did you hear that Kevin got caught

13:01.247 --> 13:04.091
- spanking it, looking at those girls?
- Ugh, yes, I did.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.061
Kevin! He's such a perv.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.461
What an idiot!

13:08.621 --> 13:11.830
You make me.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.497
Smile.

13:16.996 --> 13:20.068
You make me.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.703
Cry

13:24.170 --> 13:27.777
I like.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.150
You.

13:30.209 --> 13:33.247
- You fool.
- Yay!

13:34.613 --> 13:36.058
Thank you,
Uncle Kenny.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.254
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Thank you, Uncle Kenny.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.593
That was... quite entertaining.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.532
You know he

13:43.589 --> 13:45.432
just came back
from Palm Springs

13:45.491 --> 13:48.438
from the gay and lesbian rally
to be here at this dinner.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.667
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.766
You really mean the world
to Katie and me.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.971
Oh, Wyatt, that's sweet!

13:55.034 --> 13:57.446
Don't forget to wipe
from front to back when you pee.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.780
Shut up, Kev, before I wipe you
from front to back.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.447
As you all know, Katie and I have been
dating for a while.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.083
And although we've had
our differences from time to time,

14:08.147 --> 14:10.889
I think that

14:10.950 --> 14:12.930
love brings us through.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.592
When you find someone
who can be your true friend

14:16.655 --> 14:18.862
to love and cherish

14:18.924 --> 14:20.528
how else can you go wrong?

14:20.593 --> 14:22.869
It's like the cosmos

14:22.928 --> 14:26.000
almost align and there's like
a nuclear reaction.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.637
I have something to say.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.211
Miss Katie Elizabeth Jones,

14:35.274 --> 14:37.311
will you marry me?

14:39.178 --> 14:40.589
Um.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.855
Wait, Wyatt. Can we talk?

14:43.916 --> 14:45.520
Can't we talk about it right here,

14:45.584 --> 14:47.586
in front of all of our family?

14:47.653 --> 14:49.496
Okay

14:49.555 --> 14:51.501
I just, um

14:53.292 --> 14:55.932
I'm not... I'm not
ready for marriage.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.976
- Oh shit, I knew this was gonna happen.
- Why?

14:59.031 --> 15:01.773
- Shut up, Kevin.
- I just...

15:01.834 --> 15:04.178
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.943
This is worse than
the ending of "Beaches."

15:12.177 --> 15:14.350
Now that's fucking funny!

15:16.081 --> 15:18.357
I'm gonna get a drink
Who needs a refill?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.226
You're a jerk, Paul.
Maybe you should

15:20.286 --> 15:21.890
just skip the refill and go home

15:21.954 --> 15:23.831
I haven't laughed in years
Are you kidding me?

15:23.889 --> 15:25.163
This is funny

15:31.864 --> 15:34.868
Katie, I don't understand

15:34.934 --> 15:37.540
I can't marry you

15:39.204 --> 15:41.548
I'm sorry.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.112
Dunbrook and Balcrest, please.

15:52.084 --> 15:52.984
Hey, check this out,
the amazing girls of Brazil,

15:52.985 --> 15:55.397
Hey, check this out,
the amazing girls of Brazil,

15:55.454 --> 15:57.365
one of the erotic centers
of the world.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.502
We have traveled the globe

16:01.560 --> 16:03.506
to bring you the real girls
of the world.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.838
- They're life-sized.
- Good dog.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.208
You'll never leave me, will you, baby?

16:09.835 --> 16:11.781
Engagement ring?

16:11.837 --> 16:14.283
The exclusive celebration diamond..

16:14.340 --> 16:16.047
Don't do it, you fucking idiot!

16:16.108 --> 16:18.987
- Jared's most exclusive.
- Just break your heart.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.490
Come on, girl.
Let's get out of here.

16:22.948 --> 16:25.792
Visit us downtown
in the heart of Austin.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.634
Mopping around isn't gonna
help anything, okay?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.829
It's like... it's like
my dad always says.

16:33.892 --> 16:37.305
A setback is a set-up
for a great comeback.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.371
It's good!

16:40.432 --> 16:42.503
Yeah, it's good.
It's really good, right?

16:42.568 --> 16:44.548
You gotta get back
on that horse, right?

16:44.603 --> 16:46.207
And do some mounting
of your own, man.

16:46.271 --> 16:49.275
Stick it in some random chick's ass
They love that shit.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.617
If she's super freaky, dude,

16:51.677 --> 16:53.748
she will lick
that shit right off.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.019
But if she does,
I'm telling you, do not

16:56.081 --> 16:58.527
kiss her afterwards.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.325
Dude, what is
with you and anal?

17:00.386 --> 17:04.198
And do you really think your freaky
sex bullshit is helping the situation?

17:04.256 --> 17:06.827
- I think what he needs...
- Alone time

17:06.892 --> 17:08.565
is what I need.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.665
No anal, no hot lunches
in my mouth,

17:11.730 --> 17:13.300
no nothing!

17:13.365 --> 17:15.174
Got it? Got it?

17:15.233 --> 17:16.645
- Yes, fine.
- Okay.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.046
Whatever, dude. We just want
to see you happy again, all right?

17:19.104 --> 17:21.345
- That's it.
- Really we miss you.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.683
- We miss the old Wyatt.
- The old me?

17:23.742 --> 17:25.847
Yes! The one who's
larger than life, man.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.857
Yeah. And, you know,

17:27.913 --> 17:29.859
when the time's right,
you'll meet the one.

17:29.915 --> 17:32.122
My confidence is gone.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.960
Well, figure it out, man,
because you look like a pile of shit.

17:35.020 --> 17:39.025
Okay, waffles
for Miss Cutie Pie.

17:39.091 --> 17:43.005
Cherry pie and waffles
for Mr. Sad Eyes.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.200
Thank you.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.845
Scrambled eggs and sausage
for Master Panda Bear.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.403
Mm-hmm, you know!

17:50.469 --> 17:51.675
Thank you.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.410
You're welcome, sugar.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.213
You sure look cute today.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.185
Oh, thanks.
It's a new shirt.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.813
Boy, oh boy,
if I wasn't married, I'd take you home

17:59.878 --> 18:03.621
and lick your bamboo stick
till it fell off.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.127
Whoa!

18:05.184 --> 18:07.357
With the sweet potato pie
in your ass...

18:08.387 --> 18:10.458
eating good for a week.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.335
So, dude, you booked
an Elvis commercial, man!

18:14.393 --> 18:17.340
- Come on.
- An enema commercial

18:17.396 --> 18:20.172
with Elvis impersonator.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.712
Bam! And then it's gonna be
a national commercial

18:22.768 --> 18:24.941
and you will get paid
like that chick. Right?

18:25.003 --> 18:27.244
- Flo from the Progressive commercials.
- Right.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.843
- I'm telling you, that girl makes bank.
- She's loaded.

18:29.908 --> 18:32.479
Never have to worry
about it again. Besides,

18:32.544 --> 18:35.388
Elvis is always cool, right?
Anytime,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.791
anywhere, whomever,
how he got it.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.524
Okay, but once again
Elvis impersonator,

18:40.586 --> 18:42.463
okay?
Enema commercial

18:42.521 --> 18:44.467
equals ridiculous.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.671
I think it's pretty cool
I think you're gonna love it.

18:48.727 --> 18:51.230
Well, you know what?
I gotta go.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.037
No!
Sit down.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.702
We're not done, okay?

18:57.202 --> 18:58.647
What do you want from me?

18:58.704 --> 19:00.843
We want you
to get over it, okay?

19:00.906 --> 19:04.012
We're sick of you playing the victim
You need to move on.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.157
- You know what they say?
- Hmm?

19:07.212 --> 19:09.852
When you love someone,
let them go.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.896
- And then if they come back.
- Then you know!

19:12.951 --> 19:15.522
Then you know,
you know?

19:15.587 --> 19:17.828
You know what?
If you guys believe that shit

19:17.890 --> 19:19.631
- you're retarded.
- Come on.

19:19.691 --> 19:21.261
We're just trying
to cheer you up, okay?

19:21.326 --> 19:22.634
I love you all
See you later.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.106
Don't be a baby.
You better kill that tomorrow.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.410
Say, chief, think I could
get a Diet Coke?

20:03.835 --> 20:05.542
Hey, look

20:05.604 --> 20:07.174
if you don't
mind me asking

20:07.239 --> 20:10.118
you seem like you're
a little down in the mouth.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.020
No.

20:13.078 --> 20:15.319
- It's just, uh...
- What is it? Come on.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.054
Come on, you can talk to me
I got you covered, Sancho.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.255
I don't know, man,
this is weird.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.060
You know what's weird?

20:22.120 --> 20:24.566
A man who's got sadness
in his heart

20:24.623 --> 20:27.331
and ain't got no friends
to cut the track with?

20:28.660 --> 20:29.934
That's weird.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.975
Okay.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.533
My girlfriend left me
when I proposed to her.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.977
In front of everyone.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.880
I'm kneeling down
with the ring in my hand

20:40.939 --> 20:42.714
and she just leaves.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.823
That's a bitch, man.

20:47.879 --> 20:50.826
That's it?
That's a bitch, man"?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.961
That's all you've got to say?

20:54.019 --> 20:55.760
Well, what you want me to say?

20:59.958 --> 21:02.302
Hey, Dad, I got something for you?

21:02.361 --> 21:03.362
- Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.339
Let's see it.

21:09.835 --> 21:13.510
Oh, my name is Wyatt.

21:13.572 --> 21:17.918
And I'm a sissy
simpering boy.

21:17.976 --> 21:20.479
My girlfriend left me.

21:20.545 --> 21:23.549
All those months ago.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.591
Ain't nothing
to do about it?

21:27.653 --> 21:29.826
Except cry like the rain.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.596
Don't want to talk to nobody.

21:32.658 --> 21:37.164
Cause I like the pai-iiin.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.171
Ahhh.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.508
- That's all you got?
- That was it, baby.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.911
All right

21:44.970 --> 21:48.645
I'm not Elvis,
I'm a fraud and a loser.

21:48.707 --> 21:52.120
Who assumes the identity
of an aging Vegas act?

21:52.177 --> 21:56.455
Silly sassy boy
who ain't good.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.927
At nothing at all.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.932
Who's been acting
after all these years.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.969
And still hasn't done jack shit.

22:06.024 --> 22:09.733
Fat-ass Elvis, drugged up
can't-take-a-shit Elvis.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.435
Wearing a jacket
that his mama made him.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.273
My mama didn't make it
it's an original.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.541
You little
Mark Wahlberg wannabe.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.242
Ain't got no car,
drive a Pinto to set

22:20.305 --> 22:23.650
I drive a Cadillac,
you little whiny brat.

22:23.709 --> 22:27.657
Who probably takes dick
in the Walmart alley too...

22:27.713 --> 22:30.489
What the hell's going on?
We're trying to set up a shot here.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.290
- I need to replace you two?
- Sorry.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.161
- No, no sir.
- All right, then shut the fuck up

22:35.220 --> 22:37.291
I'm sorry, man.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.892
It's all right, man
Me too. Me too.

22:38.957 --> 22:41.077
I didn't mean that about your suit
It looks real nice.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.933
I appreciate that. I didn't mean nothing
about the Walmart crack either.

22:48.734 --> 22:51.112
So the director wants
you two on set in an hour.

22:51.169 --> 22:52.671
So we're gonna be quick.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.547
Hey, Wyatt

22:54.606 --> 22:56.813
I didn't know you got
cast in this commercial.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.219
What's up, Angie?
What are you doing here? Makeup, huh?

22:59.277 --> 23:02.520
Well yeah, I've gotta get
a couple extra bucks.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.857
- I'm gonna hightail my ass to Vegas.
- Yeah?

23:04.916 --> 23:07.328
For work or for pleasure?

23:07.386 --> 23:09.195
Oh...

23:09.254 --> 23:10.426
you don't know.

23:10.489 --> 23:13.959
- Know what?
- Katie moved back home.

23:14.025 --> 23:16.301
No, I didn't know that.

23:16.361 --> 23:17.806
How is she doing?

23:17.863 --> 23:19.934
She's getting married.

23:19.998 --> 23:22.877
A week after she got back
she met someone.

23:22.934 --> 23:25.915
What happened to
she wasn't ready"? I mean,

23:25.971 --> 23:28.144
when's the wedding?

23:28.206 --> 23:30.345
In 37 hours?

23:33.211 --> 23:34.952
Hey, I've gotta take this.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.492
But if you need to talk

23:36.548 --> 23:38.357
I'll be back
in a couple minutes, okay?

23:44.189 --> 23:46.601
Oh my God!

23:51.196 --> 23:53.198
Come here.
I know how you feel

23:53.265 --> 23:54.801
I really do

23:54.866 --> 23:56.777
I just wanted to tell you, man,

23:56.835 --> 23:59.315
yours truly

23:59.371 --> 24:01.544
I've been kicked down
a couple notches by love.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.711
Believe me, man,
I've been kicked down

24:03.775 --> 24:05.584
from Tupelo to Memphis.

24:05.644 --> 24:08.215
Well, great.
That's you and your shit

24:08.280 --> 24:10.021
and this is me and my shit.

24:10.081 --> 24:13.085
And just because you got shit
doesn't mean my shit's better.

24:13.151 --> 24:14.562
I still got shit!

24:14.619 --> 24:17.327
Wyatt, listen.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.199
You know those rare times

24:20.258 --> 24:23.728
when you find someone...
that special someone...

24:23.795 --> 24:25.741
and that someone special finds you,

24:25.797 --> 24:27.777
and you're both drawn
to each other

24:27.833 --> 24:30.143
and you get closer
and closer and you're like...

24:30.202 --> 24:32.739
- like a set of magnets?
- Yeah, it's called attraction.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.681
Exactly, except?

24:34.739 --> 24:37.219
This ain't the good kind.

24:37.275 --> 24:39.687
Huh-uh.
It's the bad kind.

24:39.744 --> 24:41.781
It's the unsexy kind.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.794
- You know what I mean?
- No.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.558
Sometimes the ugly thing in you

24:47.619 --> 24:49.292
is attracted to

24:49.354 --> 24:52.028
the ugly thing in someone else.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.969
It's like you got this little
asshole living inside you.

24:55.026 --> 24:58.007
Mm-hmm, and... and...
and that little asshole

24:58.063 --> 25:01.237
is just yearning to get
up out of you.

25:01.299 --> 25:05.145
And she's got that little
asshole inside of her.

25:05.203 --> 25:07.479
And then these two assholes,
they come together.

25:07.539 --> 25:10.042
These two assholes come out
and they shake hands, man.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.849
They kind of give
each other a little wink.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.685
- Winking assholes?
- That's right.

25:16.414 --> 25:19.657
Okay well, thanks for that
That's great.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.561
See, Wyatt

25:21.620 --> 25:25.295
what you see in her

25:25.357 --> 25:28.566
is the same thing that...
that... that's busted

25:28.627 --> 25:31.039
inside of you?

25:31.096 --> 25:34.737
Okay?
And if you truly...

25:34.799 --> 25:36.836
if you truly love that little girl

25:36.902 --> 25:38.540
you know what you're gonna do?

25:38.603 --> 25:40.742
<i>Mew“.</i>

25:42.474 --> 25:45.421
You're gonna plug up
them winking assholes.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.855
So you're saying
I should go get her?

25:47.913 --> 25:49.824
Now you're talking, Jackson.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.020
Let me tell you something.

25:53.818 --> 25:56.890
We get one go-around
in this world, Wyatt.

25:56.955 --> 25:58.434
- Okay?
- Right.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.970
If it was me,
I'd want some goddamn answers.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.336
Right? As opposed to sitting
around here bellyaching

26:03.395 --> 26:05.238
like some little pansy-ass pussy.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.038
Yeah, so I'm gonna go
to Vegas and win her back.

26:07.098 --> 26:09.169
Now you're talking, Daddy-o
Now you're talking.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.977
Hey, guys, so what's going on?

26:13.038 --> 26:14.517
I'm gonna go
plug some assholes!

26:21.546 --> 26:24.117
Are you sure he said to bring
something nice to wear?

26:24.182 --> 26:27.163
- Like we're going to a wedding?
- That's what he said.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.960
The only girl
he should marry is you

26:30.021 --> 26:31.796
I've been telling him this

26:31.856 --> 26:34.530
- ever since you grew boobies.
- Never gonna happen.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.732
Well, if all you want is friendship

26:36.795 --> 26:39.207
then I'm as straight as 6:00.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.912
Cheese and rice.

26:43.969 --> 26:46.006
- Tell me we're not hauling ass
all the way to Vegas...

26:46.071 --> 26:47.379
- No!
- ...to watch him marry

26:47.439 --> 26:49.749
this white-trash Barbie?

26:49.808 --> 26:52.550
I mean ,I knew he was desperate,
but this is ridiculous!

26:52.611 --> 26:54.648
There's no way
Wyatt's getting married.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.160
No no no no no

27:00.218 --> 27:03.165
I'm not going.
Wherever she's going, I'm not going

27:03.221 --> 27:04.996
- if she's going.
- Relax.

27:05.056 --> 27:07.593
- She's going and so are you.
- Don't touch my bag!

27:07.659 --> 27:09.536
Do you remember
our little fiasco?

27:09.594 --> 27:11.096
What are you guys
talking about?

27:11.162 --> 27:13.768
No no, you don't need to know
Nobody-

27:13.832 --> 27:15.368
don't ask, don't tell.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.880
It's fine. I didn't feel
anything anyways.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.178
You can deal with each other
for two days.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.719
- Whatever.
- Fine.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.154
- If you stay on your side of the RV.
- Done.

27:27.212 --> 27:30.716
Guys, Katie's getting
married in 27 hours,

27:30.782 --> 27:34.730
and we have to stop it. So let's
pull it together and get going, huh?

27:34.786 --> 27:38.666
We're going a road trip, huh?
What are we waiting for?

27:38.723 --> 27:41.101
Let's load up
Come on.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.298
Okay, I guess.

27:43.361 --> 27:45.272
Love you.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.839
Oh Oh.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.971
Wow.

27:51.036 --> 27:52.982
- Dude... yeah.
- Nice.

27:53.038 --> 27:55.211
It totally reminds me
of an '80s porno set.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.048
You know, this couch is
really comfortable.

27:57.108 --> 27:58.712
You wouldn't think so,
but it is.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.815
Oh, we had some hot nights
in this RV.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.826
Friggin' bananas.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.793
No, I'm serious.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.796
Oooh

28:07.852 --> 28:10.924
I mean... I mean there was
lots of bananas in here

28:10.989 --> 28:13.094
and we weren't going
to no gorilla farm,

28:13.158 --> 28:15.638
if you know what
I'm talking about.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.334
Let's get this cock wagon rolling!

28:18.396 --> 28:20.137
Hmm?

28:20.198 --> 28:22.769
Uncle Kenny, when was
the last time you drove this thing?

28:22.834 --> 28:25.474
- It does run, right?
- Don't be silly.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.110
Of course.
Let's see, it was Chicago,

28:29.174 --> 28:32.178
the great
Lesbian Luncheon of 2006.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.951
- Five years ago?
- Yeah.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.357
But it is gonna start, right?

28:37.415 --> 28:38.951
Don't be silly.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.528
Why, that's funny.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.593
My God!
I'm going to miss the wedding.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.231
- I'm in the wedding.
- You are not gonna miss the wedding!

28:51.296 --> 28:54.709
It's probably the stupid
battery or something.

28:54.766 --> 28:58.145
We'll just open
that little engine thingy

28:58.203 --> 29:00.513
and jump it.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.811
What the fuck?

29:03.875 --> 29:05.855
Oh, what the fuck was that?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.048
<i>Mama,</i>

29:07.112 --> 29:09.752
Oh my God,
we're gonna get the rabies.

29:09.814 --> 29:12.226
Okay, ideas?
Who's got one?

29:12.283 --> 29:14.229
I vote we take a frigging plane

29:14.285 --> 29:15.662
I'm trying to remember...

29:15.720 --> 29:17.722
what year was it we gave
the whores the vote?

29:17.789 --> 29:19.166
- Oh, fuck you.
- Kevin.

29:19.224 --> 29:22.603
- Not helping, dude.
- Rotten sack!

29:22.660 --> 29:24.435
I know who to call.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.943
- Who?
- It's this guy I used to date.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.501
Skeeter.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.740
Hey, Skeet,

29:31.803 --> 29:34.306
how are you,
my little sugar lumpy?

29:35.573 --> 29:37.553
Come here, you little
son of a bitch.

29:40.178 --> 29:41.350
Easy, hey!

29:42.380 --> 29:45.418
Get... you goddamn bitch
Get in, come here.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.137
Ow!
Get it out!

29:55.193 --> 29:56.433
Dear dear.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.599
Get in there.
Hey, there you go!

29:58.663 --> 30:00.165
Get in there.

30:00.231 --> 30:01.869
Easy there, there you go
That's it.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.914
Whoo, how you like that?

30:04.969 --> 30:07.279
Whoo!

30:07.338 --> 30:08.544
Whew.

30:08.606 --> 30:12.247
Well, you are up and running.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.256
- Whoa!
- This little son of a bitch

30:14.312 --> 30:16.622
just did not want
to give up the fight.

30:16.681 --> 30:18.683
Usually I can get in there

30:18.750 --> 30:21.856
and wear them down a little bit
and then they just don't fight at all.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.797
Pfft! Not this one!

30:23.855 --> 30:26.426
He even look like he done
grown up into the engine.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.801
He... he looked like
that scene from "The Fly"

30:28.860 --> 30:31.739
when he has that pod sticking out
of the side of him like that.

30:31.796 --> 30:34.538
He just looked like
a fucking Brundlecoon,

30:34.599 --> 30:37.045
all wrapped up in the hoses
and wires and shit.

30:37.101 --> 30:41.106
- I never seen it.
- Thanks for coming over, Skeeto!

30:41.172 --> 30:43.846
Well, you called me,
I was like "Wha-aaaat?"

30:43.908 --> 30:46.115
I can't believe he called me.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.248
But I didn't know whether
to shit or go blind,

30:48.313 --> 30:50.122
so I just closed one eye and farted.

30:51.149 --> 30:52.753
So...

30:52.817 --> 30:55.661
what say you and me put some
pizza rolls on the heater?

30:55.720 --> 30:59.497
And see if we can't find ourselves
at the bottom of a bottle of moonshine?

30:59.557 --> 31:01.662
- Sounds divine.
- It's a date then!

31:01.726 --> 31:03.637
Make sure you get
your sweet ass

31:03.695 --> 31:05.402
back home safe and sound
from Las Vegas.

31:05.463 --> 31:08.467
I just jumped me the RV.
I'm figure on jumping on something else.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.103
All right then,

31:10.168 --> 31:12.148
well, I gotta get going
I know some Japs

31:12.203 --> 31:13.682
who want to make
a noodle salad

31:13.738 --> 31:15.513
outta this here
little troublemaker.

31:15.573 --> 31:17.644
- That is disgusting.
- All right then.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.347
I'll see you later
It's a date.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.720
She says she's coming down
tonight.

31:21.779 --> 31:24.487
Needs a place
to crash in town tonight.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.689
Wants to know exactly
how I feel

31:30.021 --> 31:33.161
I mumble underneath
my breath...

31:33.224 --> 31:35.830
This is so much fun!
I love road trips.

31:35.894 --> 31:39.103
Me too! Let's sing
some show tunes, huh?

31:39.163 --> 31:42.975
Yes yes, let's sing show tunes
Show tunes show tunes!

31:43.034 --> 31:45.139
Oh my God,
I know one too!

31:45.203 --> 31:48.377
It goes,
Gay gay gay! Gay! Gay!

31:48.439 --> 31:51.283
For fuck's sake, Kev.
Don't be such a 'phobe, huh?

31:51.342 --> 31:53.686
- Yeah, Kevin.
- What? I just don't want

31:53.745 --> 31:55.918
to hear fucking
show tunes all night.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.119
So you think this
is a mistake?

31:58.182 --> 31:59.684
- Chasing her?
- Yeah.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.963
- I can't really say.
- Why not?

32:03.021 --> 32:06.525
Well, Wyatt, I'm your friend
I would even say

32:06.591 --> 32:08.696
- you're my best friend.
- Yeah, I'd say that too.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.335
And we've been close for so long

32:12.397 --> 32:15.003
but I can't tell you what to do here

32:15.066 --> 32:19.014
I mean,
I can't take that responsibility

32:19.070 --> 32:21.346
I won't put that on myself
if it goes the other way

32:21.406 --> 32:23.750
- and I don't think you'd want me to.
- No, I...

32:23.808 --> 32:25.583
you know, it's just...
I don't know.

32:25.643 --> 32:29.181
I have so many questions.
What is it about me that made her leave?

32:29.247 --> 32:31.659
I mean, what if it's a sign?

32:31.716 --> 32:34.162
What if she leaves again?
I don't think I could bear that.

32:34.218 --> 32:36.255
Do you love her?

32:38.222 --> 32:40.566
Yeah. I mean,
I'm miserable without her.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.606
You invested a lot
of yourself in her.

32:43.661 --> 32:47.438
I mean, all this has to go right
or it's just a big waste of time.

32:47.498 --> 32:49.535
But do you think that
equals love?

32:49.600 --> 32:52.877
Or do you think that's just
missing something, you know?

32:52.937 --> 32:55.474
So you're saying this is
a big waste of time?

32:55.540 --> 32:58.077
Never said that, Wyatt.
I just want you to be sure

32:58.142 --> 33:00.281
I don't want you to get hurt again.

33:00.345 --> 33:03.292
Yeah, man, I think
Ellen's right, you know?

33:03.348 --> 33:05.919
I don't think anybody
wants you to get hurt again.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.430
Right? Because when you are,
you act like a fucking bitch

33:08.486 --> 33:10.295
and I don't know how much
more of it I can take.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.562
Okay? So what we're gonna do...
this is the plan:

33:12.623 --> 33:14.694
you're gonna go punch
the groom in the dick,

33:14.759 --> 33:16.932
take her back,
quit being a douche, act normal,

33:16.995 --> 33:18.497
and then you're gonna knock her up

33:18.563 --> 33:20.236
and squeeze out a bunch
of other little douches.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.572
- Fucking A!
- Right?

33:21.632 --> 33:23.908
Because I'll be damned
if I'm gonna ride in this box

33:23.968 --> 33:25.641
with the frigging
show-tunes twins here,

33:25.703 --> 33:27.649
featuring Bob the Knob
and Loosey Bowels,

33:27.705 --> 33:30.481
and a cheap-ass episode
of "Dr. Phil" going on back here.

33:30.541 --> 33:32.350
So what do you want?

33:32.410 --> 33:34.913
- A fucking beer!
- I can make that happen.

33:34.979 --> 33:36.686
- Holla!
- That's nothing.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.750
Get it

33:38.816 --> 33:41.888
Uncle Kenny, can we please
get Kevin some beer?

33:41.953 --> 33:44.092
Because he's gonna drive me
crazy and this is gonna be

33:44.155 --> 33:46.635
- a really long trip without it.
- Yeah, sure.

33:53.398 --> 33:54.376
Excellent.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.708
Bath rooms?

33:56.768 --> 33:58.679
Yeah, right over there to the left.

33:58.736 --> 34:01.444
- I gotta pay a visit.
- Yes, thank you for sharing.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.447
What's it gonna be,
my friends?

34:04.509 --> 34:06.853
We will take
three six-packs of Bud

34:06.911 --> 34:09.585
and a Coke and a water
for my gay little friend right here.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.752
- You're a douche.
- Mm-hmm.

34:13.317 --> 34:15.524
Coconut water,
got electrolytes,

34:15.585 --> 34:17.395
good for the kidneys.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.297
- Three six-pack of beer.
- Ohhh.

34:19.357 --> 34:22.167
That was fast
Ready to go.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.866
The bathrooms in here are atrocious.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.876
There was something slippery
on the handle

34:27.931 --> 34:31.072
and I swear there was
a glory hole in the wall.

34:36.206 --> 34:38.016
Gentlemen, 52.55.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.646
- Damn!
- What?

34:39.710 --> 34:42.350
- That's a little steep, isn't it?
- Pesos or dollars?

34:44.248 --> 34:46.023
Oh Shit!

34:46.083 --> 34:49.121
- Oh shit what?
- It's the sarge.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.928
- Sarge like...
- The sarge is coming

34:50.987 --> 34:53.228
- ...like sergeant?
- Sergeant of what?

34:56.594 --> 34:58.938
Oh man. I'd throw my dick
in cocaine to get...

34:58.996 --> 35:02.375
- Shut the hell up.
- Do you see... I see that, come on

35:04.068 --> 35:08.016
Marcus, I thought you were
gonna close down for a while.

35:08.072 --> 35:11.019
We were, sheriff.
I just had these last customers

35:11.075 --> 35:12.986
- and I was...
- Lock the doors.

35:13.044 --> 35:15.820
- On it.
- Hey.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.330
Oh, I love what you do
with that chain.

35:23.387 --> 35:25.389
Go eat a bowl of dicks,
you douchewad.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.867
Come on, that was awesome.

35:26.924 --> 35:29.029
I don't know what this
is all about,

35:29.093 --> 35:31.039
but you can't just lock us in.

35:31.095 --> 35:34.235
Oh no?
Just did, sweetcakes.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.306
What are you gonna do about it?

35:37.368 --> 35:39.609
Well, what do you want me to do?

35:39.670 --> 35:42.446
I'll bet you'd rather be at home
with a cup of warm cocoa?

35:42.507 --> 35:44.646
Curled up
in a Winnie the Pooh snuggie,

35:44.709 --> 35:47.451
reading Oprah's book of the week.

35:47.512 --> 35:49.822
Well, that ain't gonna happen.

35:51.382 --> 35:54.625
You see, we are hunters

35:54.685 --> 35:58.394
and we are here on a mission.

35:58.456 --> 36:01.096
It's supposed to be
a secret mission,

36:01.159 --> 36:03.105
but now you faggots
are in my mission.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.334
Excuse me?

36:05.396 --> 36:08.536
Well, two regular people
and one faggot.

36:08.599 --> 36:11.239
- That's you.
- Listen, we just want beer.

36:11.302 --> 36:12.576
That's all.

36:12.637 --> 36:14.674
We all want something, son.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.451
Have you ever seen a man

36:17.508 --> 36:19.454
with a dragon tattoo on his dick?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.624
Well, I have!

36:22.680 --> 36:24.125
My daddy.

36:25.616 --> 36:29.029
He used to ride bicycles naked
when he was drunk and on leave.

36:30.154 --> 36:32.156
He'd ride endless circles
singing a song

36:32.223 --> 36:34.499
about a man with a dragon in his lap.

36:34.559 --> 36:36.163
What's this all about?

36:36.227 --> 36:38.867
Have you ever heard of a strigoi?

36:40.398 --> 36:43.004
Half zombie, half vampire

36:43.067 --> 36:45.377
one quarter werewolf?

36:46.938 --> 36:50.010
One and a quarter's
not even possible.

36:50.074 --> 36:52.020
Not possible?

36:52.076 --> 36:53.953
Then what do you call
the devil beast

36:54.011 --> 36:56.150
we have locked up
in the back there right now?

36:58.182 --> 37:00.753
- What was that awful sound?
- Holy was that?

37:00.818 --> 37:02.593
Settle down.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.690
And we mean to take
him out right now.

37:04.755 --> 37:07.031
And I don't mean for dinner.

37:07.091 --> 37:10.937
Then we will come back
and deal with you.

37:10.995 --> 37:13.976
You all have to be inspected

37:14.031 --> 37:15.567
and cleansed.

37:17.802 --> 37:19.304
Is that like a sponge bath?

37:19.370 --> 37:20.940
'Cause if so,
I'd really like for her...

37:21.005 --> 37:22.643
Shut the hell up.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.819
This cleansing could kill you.

37:25.876 --> 37:27.878
But it is the only way.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.556
Winter, to the back.

37:41.626 --> 37:43.230
You've gotta get us out of here, man

37:43.294 --> 37:46.241
I can't... the sarge

37:46.297 --> 37:49.244
I'm getting the gist here pretty good.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.906
Please open the door,

37:51.969 --> 37:54.381
and we'll be outta here
like the fucking wind.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.980
What the high holy was that?

37:59.043 --> 38:01.649
Dude, if you don't let us out of here

38:01.712 --> 38:04.215
right now, I'm going to
penetrate your colon so deep

38:04.282 --> 38:06.853
that your shit is gonna
have my Nike marks on it.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.864
This is insane.
There is no such thing

38:09.920 --> 38:12.958
as a strigoi.
Am I on "Fear Tactics" right now?

38:14.091 --> 38:15.764
<i>Marcus?</i>

38:15.826 --> 38:18.932
My ex-fiancée is
getting married in

38:18.996 --> 38:20.236
17-

38:20.298 --> 38:21.868
...17 hours.

38:21.932 --> 38:24.276
Marrying another guy?

38:24.335 --> 38:26.315
Yeah, hence the "ex" part

38:26.370 --> 38:27.872
I gotta stop her.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.315
Do you love her?

38:29.373 --> 38:31.375
Of course I do

38:31.442 --> 38:33.752
I was almost married once.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.950
Then you know exactly how I feel.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.687
Yeah. She broke my heart

38:39.750 --> 38:42.629
Katie broke mine, but you see
I have a chance to change that.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.425
But you gotta let me
out of here to do that.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.128
Do you think so?

38:48.192 --> 38:50.297
I can do this
for the both of us, Marcus.

38:51.562 --> 38:53.041
Oh, to hell with it.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.077
Love needs to win sometimes.

38:55.132 --> 38:57.237
- Yeah!
- Yes.

38:57.301 --> 39:00.145
Come on, you all get out of here
Let's get out of here quick.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.314
- What are you doing?
- Beer... we need it.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.378
Come on, let's get outta here.

39:07.445 --> 39:08.645
Let's get the hell outta here.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.259
What the hell?

39:20.091 --> 39:21.832
Oh-hhhh Shit!

39:21.892 --> 39:23.599
Let's get outta here!

39:27.264 --> 39:29.540
Now that was purely awesome

39:29.600 --> 39:31.944
Jesus, Becky, nice right hook.

39:32.002 --> 39:33.743
You almost broke my jaw.

39:33.804 --> 39:36.182
Did you have to rip
my top open, huh, Alan?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.550
- Fucking asshole.
- I was giving them a show.

39:38.609 --> 39:40.816
What's the harm?
Besides, you have great tits.

39:40.878 --> 39:40.910
All I'm saying is, like,

39:40.911 --> 39:42.322
All I'm saying is, like,

39:42.380 --> 39:45.224
what if it's real... the strigoi?

39:45.282 --> 39:47.228
And there are more
of them out there?

39:47.284 --> 39:50.857
It's ridiculous! The world's
not coming to an end by strigoi.

39:50.921 --> 39:53.902
There are a lot of things,
actually, that happen

39:53.958 --> 39:56.666
that no one has
an explanation for.

39:56.727 --> 39:59.333
Someone should have been
called is all I'm saying.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.502
Like who? The cops?

40:03.033 --> 40:05.309
I need my bag.

40:05.369 --> 40:07.940
Kev, would you grab it for me?

40:08.005 --> 40:10.383
- It's an emergency.
- Fine.

40:10.441 --> 40:12.421
- Which one is it?
- The pink one.

40:12.476 --> 40:14.547
Obviously.

40:14.612 --> 40:18.719
- Uh, you want me to grab something?
- Xanax pronto.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.729
Oka-aaay!

40:20.785 --> 40:23.356
Fucking bong rip,
how about one of those, please?

40:23.421 --> 40:25.560
Whoa, what the fuck is this?

40:25.623 --> 40:27.660
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh my God!

40:27.725 --> 40:30.228
- Get it out of here!
- Hey hey hey.

40:30.294 --> 40:32.365
Calm down, everybody, please.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.274
- Let me explain.
- Lookit,

40:35.332 --> 40:37.334
it has pubic hair on it.

40:37.401 --> 40:38.846
Oh my God!

40:38.903 --> 40:41.008
Kevin, get that out of here!

40:41.071 --> 40:42.846
- No telling where that's been.
- I teach classes

40:42.907 --> 40:44.545
on how to give the perfect.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.654
- B.J.

40:48.712 --> 40:52.489
The course is called
"Slob on the knob"

40:52.550 --> 40:54.325
and give a good job.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.558
What? What don't you just use
a banana or something?

40:56.620 --> 40:59.032
It's the visual effect.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.626
They learn better if it seems real.

41:01.692 --> 41:04.866
Well, why the fuck would you
even need it on this trip anyway?

41:04.929 --> 41:07.000
Well, you never know
who's going to need

41:07.064 --> 41:09.010
a Mr. Tugglesworth of their own?

41:09.066 --> 41:12.104
And practice makes perfect.

41:15.105 --> 41:18.643
Hey, look at these two.
Probably running from the strigoi.

41:18.709 --> 41:20.950
Look like a couple of hippies.

41:21.011 --> 41:23.082
- Dude, pull over.
- No, Kevin!

41:23.147 --> 41:26.594
- No hitchhikers!
- We can't leave them out there

41:26.650 --> 41:29.756
I mean they have weed
I know it. I'm positive.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.925
And... and... and if
anything happens,

41:31.989 --> 41:34.993
I take full responsibility.
I will take your blowjob class.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.596
I... I will do the bob-my-knob thing
Come on!

41:37.661 --> 41:39.504
Come on,
I'll blow Mr. Tugglesworth!

41:39.563 --> 41:41.702
Now that I gotta see.

41:41.765 --> 41:44.837
You take full responsibility?

41:46.537 --> 41:49.882
- Oh yeah.
- Whoo!

41:59.283 --> 42:01.160
Thank you for extracting us

42:01.218 --> 42:04.358
from that derelict and

42:04.421 --> 42:07.425
- arenaceous desert floor.
- Yes yes yes.

42:07.491 --> 42:10.734
Ahh, and this is my love partner

42:10.794 --> 42:13.365
and traveling companion..

42:16.867 --> 42:19.040
Destiny.

42:19.103 --> 42:21.674
- Dest... Destiny.
- Destiny.

42:25.109 --> 42:28.249
Bless your souls
for your kindness.

42:28.312 --> 42:30.314
They seem nice.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.861
- I don't know about that.
- Yeah right, Kevin.

42:32.917 --> 42:34.760
You guys got any weed?

42:34.818 --> 42:38.027
- Oh, we don't have any weed.
- No weed.

42:38.088 --> 42:42.366
- No weed.
- Hello, Mr. Tugglesworth.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.838
This is gonna be good.

42:44.895 --> 42:47.205
Sure you guys don't have
any weed at all?

42:47.264 --> 42:50.768
- No...
- Destructive

42:50.834 --> 42:55.374
vegetation.

42:57.041 --> 42:59.453
- Awww.
- ...ln our possessions.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.319
Damn it!

43:01.378 --> 43:04.291
But we do have

43:04.348 --> 43:06.157
the dried gift of the mother.

43:06.216 --> 43:08.389
Oh snap!

43:10.854 --> 43:14.063
Join us for a blessing?

43:14.124 --> 43:16.104
Hell yeah.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.766
The Earth turns

43:18.829 --> 43:21.673
all on a ship of souls?

43:21.732 --> 43:25.236
Come with me.
And she rewards us with life.

43:25.302 --> 43:27.339
We suck

43:27.404 --> 43:29.850
from the dusky teat.

43:29.907 --> 43:32.945
Birth, life,

43:33.010 --> 43:34.717
death.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.553
We suck the life of the mother

43:36.614 --> 43:40.585
and taste birth.

43:40.651 --> 43:44.963
- Destiny, anoint him.
- Yes, anoint me!

43:45.022 --> 43:48.196
- I'm so ready.
- Show him your dark cycle.

43:57.034 --> 43:59.378
Baby, there's no rides out here.

43:59.436 --> 44:01.382
Cycle of life, asshole.

44:01.438 --> 44:02.940
Come on, Wyatt, let's go.

44:03.007 --> 44:04.850
Take this with you.

44:04.908 --> 44:08.151
- So lame, so lame!
- We're cleansing ourselves of you

44:09.346 --> 44:11.087
Wyatt, don't be so mean.

44:15.452 --> 44:17.989
That dumb bitch on the skateboard.

44:18.055 --> 44:19.864
She can't even catch up.

44:19.923 --> 44:21.129
Cool ritual, bitch.

44:21.191 --> 44:21.224
Naw, man, I don't think it's a sign.

44:21.225 --> 44:24.331
Naw, man, I don't think it's a sign.

44:24.395 --> 44:27.171
It was a total fluke.
You're not a shit magnet.

44:29.566 --> 44:33.378
- I'm sorry.
- It was a really nice ceremony

44:33.437 --> 44:36.043
I mean she really honored you.

44:37.641 --> 44:39.780
- Awww.
- Okay okay. Leave him alone.

44:43.113 --> 44:45.059
Oh dude.

44:45.115 --> 44:48.096
I'm on fucking fire, man.

44:48.152 --> 44:50.098
Yeah, what the fuck
are you doing here?

44:52.022 --> 44:53.501
Dude?

44:54.525 --> 44:56.766
- What?
- Dude!

44:57.995 --> 44:58.973
What?

45:00.431 --> 45:03.105
Dude!

45:03.167 --> 45:05.340
What... what?

45:05.402 --> 45:07.245
What?

45:08.305 --> 45:10.307
- Dude?
- What?

45:10.374 --> 45:12.047
What?

45:17.981 --> 45:20.552
Again, what are you
doing here on the RV?

45:20.617 --> 45:23.393
What do you mean what am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

45:23.454 --> 45:26.628
What are you, just some kind
of fucking ninja Batman or something?

45:26.690 --> 45:30.137
Fucking ladies wrestling league
here or something, man?

45:30.194 --> 45:33.073
Dude, what are you doing here?

45:33.130 --> 45:36.475
I think you dented
my fucking beard, man!

45:37.735 --> 45:39.646
What are you doing here?

45:40.971 --> 45:42.507
You mean prior to being accosted

45:42.573 --> 45:44.917
and having my fucking joint
stabbed out on me?

45:44.975 --> 45:47.683
I was using the fucking
facilities, man.

45:47.745 --> 45:50.555
You know,
the fucking head here?

45:50.614 --> 45:52.651
Dude!
Oh, dude.

45:54.551 --> 45:57.259
Dude, you're not supposed...
you crapped in the RV?

45:57.321 --> 45:59.699
You're not... no one
craps in the RV, dude!

45:59.757 --> 46:01.998
Hey, man, well, it sure the shit

46:02.059 --> 46:05.040
ain't a fucking reading chair,
now is it there, Komatsu.

46:06.296 --> 46:08.037
Not fucking comfortable enough.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.009
- Hey, man.
- No no, I don't like it here.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.844
Dude, how did you...

46:14.905 --> 46:16.509
Dude felt the pressure.

46:16.573 --> 46:18.610
Release was the option I had, man

46:18.675 --> 46:21.417
I came here for some
quiet time, you know?

46:21.478 --> 46:25.119
Meditate on my colon, you know?
Maybe fucking blow a jay.

46:25.182 --> 46:28.220
Next thing I know,
this motherfucker's moving, man.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.728
But I got... oh shit

46:32.790 --> 46:34.201
I gotta tell you though

46:34.258 --> 46:35.999
as far as RV shitters go,

46:36.059 --> 46:39.063
This has
got some fucking space, man

46:39.129 --> 46:40.836
I fucking like this guy
You know.

46:40.898 --> 46:43.003
I could spend some
fucking time in here.

46:43.066 --> 46:45.706
It's got some nice
wallpaper and shit, man.

46:45.769 --> 46:48.272
Dude, listen, we can't...

46:48.338 --> 46:50.340
If they find out you're on here

46:50.407 --> 46:53.047
they're gonna flip, okay?
So just lay low and just chill, man.

46:53.110 --> 46:55.215
And we'll figure out
a way to get you off.

46:55.279 --> 46:58.920
You know what? I think you're the one
who needs to fucking drop a deuce.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.655
Okay.

47:00.717 --> 47:03.698
Look at you,
all fucking backed up.

47:03.754 --> 47:06.166
Fucking ninja back up

47:06.223 --> 47:09.227
I think you need to ninja
that shit right out of there, man.

47:09.293 --> 47:12.297
Okay, just chill and be quiet.

47:12.362 --> 47:14.433
Why don't you keep it
on the DL and have a hit?

47:14.498 --> 47:15.602
Shut up.

47:20.370 --> 47:22.907
Oh well

47:22.973 --> 47:25.317
I guess I'll have a drink

47:25.375 --> 47:26.979
I'll drink to that!

47:38.655 --> 47:40.760
Wow, I'm so stoned.

47:40.824 --> 47:42.428
Hmm.

47:42.492 --> 47:44.870
That really took it out of me.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.947
Yeah, her too?

48:10.254 --> 48:11.961
You lucky guy

48:12.022 --> 48:14.366
Wyatt, what's wrong?

48:14.424 --> 48:16.426
I don't know.

48:16.493 --> 48:18.473
Something doesn't feel right

48:20.063 --> 48:21.770
I think we need to turn around.

48:21.832 --> 48:24.438
No, you were just having
a bad dream, that's all.

48:24.501 --> 48:27.948
We're not turning around.
You love her, end of story.

48:28.005 --> 48:30.542
Okay?
Get some rest.

48:30.607 --> 48:31.677
All right.

48:31.742 --> 48:34.518
A sunny afternoon

48:34.578 --> 48:39.118
I've been up for hours
and I don't know what to do today.

48:40.183 --> 48:43.596
Tomorrow forever.

48:45.889 --> 48:48.369
You all right, Uncle Kenny?
You need me to drive?

48:48.425 --> 48:50.302
Oh, I'll be fine. I'm fine.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.273
Nobody drives Ernest but me

48:53.330 --> 48:54.832
I'll be fine.

48:56.533 --> 48:58.740
All right then.
Let me know if you need something

48:58.802 --> 49:01.214
I will, thanks

49:07.844 --> 49:11.485
I want to leave this place
and start again

49:11.548 --> 49:15.428
I don't want to go back
where I began

49:15.485 --> 49:19.194
I want to find
somewhere I belong

49:19.256 --> 49:22.703
I don't want to make
this last word.

49:24.061 --> 49:26.098
Without a song

49:40.277 --> 49:42.757
I should clean this place up.

49:42.813 --> 49:46.590
Grab a shower and shave
and go outside...

49:49.086 --> 49:51.430
As long as I am by it.

49:51.488 --> 49:54.196
The phone never rings

49:54.257 --> 49:56.396
I don't know what I'm doing.

49:56.460 --> 49:59.031
But I'm making new friends

49:59.096 --> 50:02.475
I know that this ain't working?

50:09.506 --> 50:12.419
Hey, what do you think about
that waitress over at Nick's diner?

50:12.476 --> 50:14.649
She sure was something.

50:14.711 --> 50:17.055
Those were some monstrous jugs,
weren't they?

50:17.114 --> 50:20.118
Oh yeah, I gave them titties
a pearl necklace last weekend.

50:20.183 --> 50:22.925
Whoo-wee!
Boy, you give a girl a piece of jewelry

50:22.986 --> 50:24.090
she might let you slip it in her.

50:24.154 --> 50:26.634
No, you dumb-ass

50:26.690 --> 50:29.603
I didn't buy her nothing
I shot it on her neck.

50:29.659 --> 50:33.436
- You shot what on her neck?
- My fucking spunk!

50:33.497 --> 50:36.376
My essence.
My goddamn man-chowder.

50:38.335 --> 50:39.871
Oh, she let you do that?

50:39.936 --> 50:41.847
Hell yeah, she let me do that!

50:41.905 --> 50:44.317
She was like, "Oh, Daddy"

50:44.374 --> 50:46.513
goo me up, Daddy!
Goo me up!"

50:46.576 --> 50:49.147
Then she held
her big old jugs up like that

50:49.212 --> 50:51.886
and I sprayed 'em like Engine 59

50:51.948 --> 50:53.757
I even got a little on her lip too.

50:53.817 --> 50:55.819
You oughta try that one.

50:57.654 --> 51:01.033
Shit. Donna would never let me
goo up that waitress.

51:01.091 --> 51:03.970
She'd kill me!
Huh-uh, huh-uh.

51:04.027 --> 51:06.598
Are you inbred or something?

51:06.663 --> 51:08.836
Donna!
Give Donna the goo.

51:08.899 --> 51:11.675
This ain't useful.

51:11.735 --> 51:14.215
How on earth did they ever
let you have a gun?

51:18.909 --> 51:20.589
- Son of a bitch.
- What the hell was that?

51:20.644 --> 51:22.988
Damned RV hit our car, man.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.564
Hey, boy.
You want to step out of that vehicle

51:36.626 --> 51:38.367
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

51:38.428 --> 51:40.499
Yes sir, officer.

51:46.570 --> 51:48.880
Over there, miss. This way

51:48.939 --> 51:51.010
shaman.

51:51.074 --> 51:53.247
You too.
Come on, Pops, come on.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.088
Are we still in Texas?

51:58.148 --> 52:00.685
Have you been drinking, son?

52:00.750 --> 52:04.721
No, officer. I must have
fallen asleep at the wheel.

52:04.788 --> 52:06.927
We'll just see about that
What about drugs?

52:06.990 --> 52:09.061
- You been doing them drugs, boy?
- No.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.127
Nothing.

52:11.261 --> 52:12.899
Okay, why don't you just
keep your lips sealed

52:12.963 --> 52:15.034
and give me your license
and registration?

52:15.098 --> 52:17.339
We'll see if you have
any warrants coming back.

52:17.400 --> 52:20.404
You better hope and pray
you don't come back with any warrants.

52:20.470 --> 52:23.110
No, officer,
I don't have any warrants

52:23.173 --> 52:25.119
Uncle Kenny,
you hit their patrol car?

52:25.175 --> 52:27.746
I changed the music
to a country station,

52:27.811 --> 52:30.291
- all of a sudden, kaboom!
- Country's like the worst choice!

52:30.347 --> 52:32.349
You should have picked something
like, more upbeat.

52:32.415 --> 52:34.520
- Like Green Bay?
- Green Bay?

52:34.584 --> 52:36.564
- Green Day.
- Green Day, yes yes!

52:36.620 --> 52:37.963
- Green Day would work.
- Oh yeah yeah!

52:38.021 --> 52:39.295
What if he picked that...

52:39.356 --> 52:40.994
what is that album called again?

52:41.057 --> 52:43.059
"Pukie"?
Wouldn't that be great, Kev?

52:43.126 --> 52:45.572
All I know is I'm driving
the rest of the way.

52:45.629 --> 52:49.805
Like hell you are.
Nobody drives Ernest but me.

52:49.866 --> 52:51.004
- I'm fine.
- Ernest?

52:51.067 --> 52:52.307
Okay, shut it, shut it!

52:52.369 --> 52:54.872
Just shut it already!
Do you realize how much trouble

52:54.938 --> 52:57.578
- you guys are all in?
- Whatever.

52:57.641 --> 53:01.214
Listen to me, people around these parts
don't take too kindly to your kind.

53:01.278 --> 53:03.656
I might end up throwing you in jail.

53:03.713 --> 53:05.624
You ever been
to a gang bang? Huh?

53:05.682 --> 53:08.925
You know what it's like
to be gang-raped? Sweet thing?

53:08.985 --> 53:12.432
Bending down, picking up the soap?
You're gonna find out the hard way.

53:12.489 --> 53:15.527
- That's not so bad.
- He's clear, partner.

53:15.592 --> 53:18.766
- Clear.
- You know what? Check the RV.

53:18.828 --> 53:20.830
Step aside, sir. Aside!

53:20.897 --> 53:22.706
- Sorry.
- Here.

53:22.766 --> 53:24.507
Thank... thank you, officer.

53:30.607 --> 53:33.417
My God. Nothing!

53:33.476 --> 53:36.286
Except this.
What do you make of this, partner?

53:36.346 --> 53:39.156
Goddamn sickos.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.559
Right? You know what?

53:40.617 --> 53:42.537
I want to give
one of them girls a cavity search!

53:44.487 --> 53:46.688
But you wouldn't know
what to do with one of those girls

53:46.690 --> 53:48.692
if they was sitting on your face.

53:48.758 --> 53:50.601
- Maybe a pearl necklace.
- Take this!

53:50.660 --> 53:53.300
- All right, who's first?!
- One Lincoln seven.

53:53.363 --> 53:55.138
Stay right here.

53:58.268 --> 54:00.305
One Lincoln seven. Go ahead

54:00.370 --> 54:02.611
415, customer at a minimart

54:02.672 --> 54:05.016
stating a half-man,
half-zombie being chased

54:05.075 --> 54:07.021
by a shirtless female officer.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.148
Sumbitch zombie man-beast

54:09.212 --> 54:11.385
chasing folks over at the minimart!

54:11.448 --> 54:12.893
Hey, Jess, let's go!

54:12.949 --> 54:15.088
What about a citation?

54:15.151 --> 54:16.858
Forget about the citation.

54:16.920 --> 54:19.730
I had a pearl necklace for you, honey.

54:19.789 --> 54:22.429
Old truckers never die

54:22.492 --> 54:24.836
I'll tell you, girl, I wouldn't lie.

54:24.894 --> 54:27.465
What can I do do do?

54:33.837 --> 54:35.839
- Let's get outta here!
- Let's go!

54:35.905 --> 54:37.851
- Right?

54:59.963 --> 55:02.375
Shit.
Hey, Ellen, can you... can...

55:02.432 --> 55:05.242
my leg's falling asleep.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.805
Hey, Ellen,
my leg's falling asleep.

55:09.539 --> 55:11.780
Can you move a little bit?

55:15.512 --> 55:18.049
No, seriously,
I can't feel my leg.

55:19.316 --> 55:20.954
Oh Shit!

55:24.321 --> 55:26.392
Dude, what are you doing?

55:26.456 --> 55:27.833
Nothing.
I'm... I'm... I'm fine

55:27.891 --> 55:29.734
I just dropped something
Go back to sleep.

55:29.793 --> 55:32.603
It's too late for that.
What the fuck are we listening to?

55:32.662 --> 55:34.835
I'm just trying
to stay awake, man.

55:34.898 --> 55:38.141
- Change it if you want.
- Yeah, I'll find something.

55:38.201 --> 55:40.340
- No, wait!
- Oh shit!

55:40.403 --> 55:43.213
Nice boner, dude! Does Ellen
know you're skull-fucking her?

55:43.273 --> 55:46.982
- What's going on, huh?
- Dude, Ellen is sleeping on Wyatt's lap

55:47.043 --> 55:50.149
and he's got a huge boner
Classic.

55:50.213 --> 55:52.124
Interesting.

55:52.182 --> 55:54.128
It's not funny.

55:54.184 --> 55:57.495
- It doesn't mean anything.
- Oh, I beg to differ, my dear.

55:57.554 --> 56:00.364
It's not even a boner!
It's just a bulge in my pants.

56:00.423 --> 56:02.664
Naw naw, that's bullshit, man.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.798
- That is fully a boner.
- Shut up! Ellen.

56:07.530 --> 56:10.010
Oh, you... fuck, man!

56:10.066 --> 56:11.409
Yeah, motherfucker!

56:11.468 --> 56:13.846
Oh, I'm going to punch you
in the dick later.

56:37.594 --> 56:39.733
- Number one or number two?
- Oh, come on!

56:39.796 --> 56:42.106
No no, first rule of the RV

56:42.165 --> 56:45.772
is no one dumps in the RV
unless they want to empty the RV.

56:45.835 --> 56:49.044
- Shit!
- Not here, grasshopper.

56:49.105 --> 56:50.607
Ha ha!
Frickin' bridge troll.

56:50.673 --> 56:52.880
Number one or number two.

56:52.942 --> 56:54.979
"Cannot cross my bridge
if it's number two."

56:55.044 --> 56:58.287
Hey hey, you gotta pull over, dude
I gotta go.

56:58.348 --> 57:00.828
We don't have time to stop.
Use the bathroom back there.

57:00.884 --> 57:03.421
- I can't, it's number two.
- Contract your sphincter.

57:05.221 --> 57:07.565
Come on, man, I gotta go.
I'm about to crap my pants.

57:07.624 --> 57:09.661
Hey, maybe it's time
to pay Angie back?

57:09.726 --> 57:13.401
- Piss off, Wyatt!
- Wyatt, if Kevin shits the rug

57:13.463 --> 57:15.238
you're cleaning it.

57:15.298 --> 57:18.279
- Come on, man.
- I will, I will!

57:18.334 --> 57:20.007
I'm just messing with him

57:21.371 --> 57:23.783
I don't know, Kev.
This is an Indian reservation

57:23.840 --> 57:26.821
in the middle of nowhere.
I don't have a good feeling about this.

57:26.876 --> 57:29.254
What the fuck are you doing
on an Indian reservation?

57:29.312 --> 57:31.053
The road goes right through it.

57:31.114 --> 57:34.391
Um, well, fuck it.
I can't hold it, man.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.522
So just pull over
and I'll say an apology

57:36.586 --> 57:39.396
and a prayer to the great buffalo
then for making doodie on his land.

57:43.493 --> 57:45.871
Oh yes, the big one!
The big one!

57:45.929 --> 57:47.875
Oh, you... God.

57:50.467 --> 57:53.277
- Oh!
- Use another stall, buddy

57:53.336 --> 57:55.213
I'm taking a shit!

57:55.271 --> 57:57.808
Oh fuck!

58:00.610 --> 58:02.851
Oh, you've gotta-

58:05.849 --> 58:08.261
Oh, God damn it.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.389
It's just you and me, old buddy

58:10.453 --> 58:12.592
I need half of you for later.

58:12.655 --> 58:15.295
Half of you for now.

58:15.358 --> 58:17.804
Okay.

58:17.861 --> 58:20.535
No time. No.

58:20.597 --> 58:24.067
Ohhhh um,

58:24.133 --> 58:26.135
How long are you gonna be?

58:27.403 --> 58:30.316
How long are you gonna be?

58:30.373 --> 58:32.478
I just sat down, man
I might be awhile.

58:32.542 --> 58:35.318
You're disabled?
- No-oooo.

58:35.378 --> 58:37.619
How long are you gonna be?

58:39.616 --> 58:41.857
I'm disabled right now, man.

58:41.918 --> 58:43.955
Get the fuck outta here. Whew

58:44.020 --> 58:46.626
I'm not leaving
until you open this door.

58:53.663 --> 58:56.109
- Why?
- You gonna be awhile?

58:56.165 --> 58:59.009
Are you fucking kidding me?
What's wrong with you, man?

58:59.068 --> 59:02.743
- Use another stall.
- I'm crippled, you dumb-ass.

59:02.805 --> 59:04.478
Game.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.817
You wanna use your dick
for a birthday candle?

59:06.876 --> 59:09.584
You'd better open this door

59:09.646 --> 59:11.284
I can't, man,
you're gonna have to wait.

59:11.347 --> 59:14.487
- I'm mid-squeeze right now, nubs.
- Come on!

59:15.518 --> 59:18.499
I'm not leaving
until you open this door.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.728
What, did you get fucking hit
in the head or something, man?

59:20.790 --> 59:22.497
Use a different stall, you weirdo!

59:22.559 --> 59:25.665
- What?
- I said you're gonna have to wait.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.935
Figure something out,
Wheelie Jim!

59:31.834 --> 59:33.108
What the fuck?

59:51.087 --> 59:53.863
Uncle Kenny,
why are you sitting?

59:53.923 --> 59:55.698
He's not in there.
What's going on?

59:55.758 --> 59:58.034
It seems he has offended some

59:58.094 --> 01:00:01.701
big-shot tribal leader or something.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.412
Yeah, he offends everyone.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:07.448
Where is he, in the office?

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:10.313
It's not gonna be that easy.

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.853
What the hell is going on here?

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:15.480
Your friend has offended an elder

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.525
and therefore
he must be punished.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.357
Well, you bring him down
right now or we are calling the cops.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:24.398
Go ahead.
They have no jurisdiction here.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.900
No, wait, is there

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:29.232
some kind of offering
that we can make?

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.034
Here, it's all I have
Please just take it.

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.076
And here, I got a couple too.

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:39.037
Your white-man money
is no good here.

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:40.262
- But you just took it.
- Huh?

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:41.976
I am unburdening you.

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:44.211
The less you have,
the better you are.

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:46.344
No, you listen to me!
I don't have time to...

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.591
Okay okay!
This isn't gonna resolve anything

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:55.952
ls there anything that
we can do to bring our friend back?

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:00.263
I will call the council and I
will relay to them your request.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.735
Okay, fine.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.772
When do we start?

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.774
- I need to borrow a phone.
- Oh Jeez.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.071
- What?
- Diot.

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:14.638
Really?

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.279
Yes, I'm here with the guys.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.628
And put $5 on Duckling
Okay.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.298
- Are you kidding me?
- Ha ha!

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.007
Hey!

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:45.307
You'll get your phone back
with your friend.

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:50.481
The council says you may do
the ritual of the great Tatonka.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.952
And that should take care of everything.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.818
Okay fine.
When do we start?

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:57.448
End of the road at sundown.

01:01:57.513 --> 01:02:00.983
And how long is this
gonna take... about?

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.530
The ritual of the Tatonka
can take five days.

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:06.192
We don't have five days.

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:09.259
Well, screw this!
Let's just pick him up

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.236
- on the way back.
- No no no.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:14.707
- We're taking him right now.
- Well, fine then!

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:20.578
Really?
Is it really gonna take five days?

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:23.310
I've seen it done in less time

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:27.085
ls there any way it could
be done in, like...

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:30.420
this ritual... in like an hour?

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:36.723
- It's never been attempted.
- No?

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.323
I have seen it done in...

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:41.629
in less time.

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.796
It would require all of you
working as one,

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.864
and maybe... just maybe you
will please the great spirit.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.909
Okay, that's promising.

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.342
- Yeah.
- Know this

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:54.747
if the spirit is not satisfied
you are not protected

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:57.341
and the ritual may kill all of you?

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.010
What?!

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:01.681
End of the road.

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:04.190
You should start driving.

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.249
Let's go, come on!

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.360
Do you think
we're gonna make it in time?

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.528
Yeah.

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:19.596
- I hope you're right.
- I am right. I'm always right.

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:21.073
- Yeah yeah.
- You know that.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.440
And if not?

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:29.415
Is this the place?
We're in the middle of BFE.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.315
What's BFE again?

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:34.082
Hmm, so that's what
a tepee looks like.

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.319
Guys, this looks really creepy.

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.361
Where are we?

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.026
- I have no idea.
- Oh my God!

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:46.999
- That looks like a...
- Where the hell is this place, huh?

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.636
This must be it

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.374
I don't like this.

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.966
Me neither.

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:58.945
Let's just do what we need to do
and get the hell outta here.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.716
You four have come
for your friend

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.048
who has greatly offended an elder?

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:09.283
- And so the tribe.
- Yes, we have.

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.621
And you intend to take
the ceremony of the Tatonka?

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.756
- Yeah.
- Yes, we do.

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:19.431
- Can we see our friend?
- No.

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.235
Follow.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.007
Oh sweet baby Jesus!

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.638
I love wheelchair people.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.011
- Kevin.
- Oh my God.

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.709
- That looks like it hurts.
- Merry Christmas.

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:39.116
Man, you know,
like when I was a little kid

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:41.587
I used to play
cowboys and Indians,

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.487
I was always an Indian.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:46.083
- What have you done with him?
- You can see him.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:49.891
There he is. He's up
on the giant thing and he is fine.

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.590
He is in the spirit world.

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.258
Hey, Ellen,

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:55.802
you know you and Wyatt should bang

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:59.271
and make uptight Caucasian babies.

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:02.070
Just thought I should tell you that
I saw it in a vision.

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.439
No big deal.

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.638
He is so fucked.

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:09.513
It seems like a bad night
I had in Ibiza.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.519
He committed the disrespect
in the bathroom.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.612
So the journey for your friend

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:16.953
is a muddy disgrace
as the elder felt.

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:18.515
Everybody should get stoned.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.632
And they should
throw rocks at me, man,

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:28.692
in the mud
while I'm wearing this...

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.897
Now are you ready
to begin your journey?

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:35.237
Pray the great spirit
smiles upon you.

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:37.437
Sound prehistoric.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.377
Will there be
hors d'oeuvres there?

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:42.279
Maybe some mystery fingers?

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:45.410
Do you think I could get
clubbed by a warrior?

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:46.612
Uncle Kenny!

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.181
Follow.

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:52.487
- I don't like this.
- Me neither.

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.757
Hey, man, can I have
some more of that soup?

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.031
So begins the ceremony
of the Tatonka.

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:09.269
Like my ancestors before me
who have shown me

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:12.040
the gift of the Tatonka,

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.945
and those who didn't
show me shit

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.041
cause they were kinda dicks,

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:20.212
I begin this offering.

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:24.658
Oh great spirit,

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:28.218
guide us in this journey.

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:33.425
Yes.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:35.560
Drink.

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:39.865
What's in this?

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.636
Cause I don't do dark liquor.

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:44.974
It's roofies, dear.
You've done it before.

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:47.173
Drink.

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:55.549
Drink.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.790
Um.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.635
Drink.

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:17.538
Blech.

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.844
Drink.

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:28.281
Can I get a straw
and maybe a twist of lemon?

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.722
- Huh?
- Drink.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.453
Okay okay.

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:39.559
Good. Good good.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:42.967
Now the great spirit will
show you the way.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.920
How come you're not drinking?

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.471
Not my journey.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.511
I'm glad you think it's funny.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:58.381
Last time I felt like this,
it was at the

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.580
and when I woke up
I was covered in ham.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.884
Drink.

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:06.188
Do you want to scalp me, man?
Go ahead!

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.058
All these people out there,
they're all scalping me.

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.428
This girl in Vegas,
she's scalping me.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:13.228
Scalping me in the ass!

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:19.870
Thank you. That helps.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.341
See your destiny?

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:24.344
I see myself.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:28.314
Pigtails, cute little gingham skirt

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:31.010
lollipops.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:34.850
Teasing all the football players
from the sideline,

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.447
showing my little b-bubble ass

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:42.087
and then the whole entire team
will jerk jizz all over their cleats

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:44.688
right there
on the 50-yard line

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:46.493
I am a dynamo!

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.438
Drink.

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:56.939
Mmm, I'm in a white forest.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.906
But I'm hanging from a tree,

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.417
upside down like a bat,
like a big black bat.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:08.011
And my tongue is licking

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.648
the snow again

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:12.750
and again!

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.126
What does it mean?

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.791
It means you're insane

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:22.495
I thought it was cool.

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:28.675
Drink.

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:33.443
Man, you guys got
the raw end of the deal, man.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.243
Yes, we know.

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:37.180
White people are dicks!

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.517
And I can say that
because I'm white.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.145
Drink.

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:47.750
Oh man

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:50.091
I don't even care
if we get there right now

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:52.462
I just wanna

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.865
stay here

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.369
with the twigs and the spit

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.470
Ellen, what's your vision?

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.908
Oh no no, I'm not... not telling.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.946
What?

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:08.311
Don't tell.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.611
- No.
- Come on.

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:14.513
This is just for me.
I wanna go see the fire.

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:16.648
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Okay.

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:18.988
Come on,
give me your hand

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.332
Wyatt!

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:38.175
Wyatt!

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.210
We're leaving now

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.216
Wyatt!

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.945
We're leaving.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:47.009
Where are you?

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.193
Are we dead?

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.396
I wish we were.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.341
We have to get to Vegas!
Oh my God,

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.741
- we have to get to the wedding.
- Where's the RV?

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:13.143
- What about Kevin and the others?
- Fuck!

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:15.580
We have to get
to fucking Vegas!

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:18.050
The wedding... fuck.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.178
We're gonna miss everything.

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:22.984
- Well, you're not helping.
- Try dancing or something?

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:32.622
Really?
Come on, who doesn't

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.599
pick up a chick
in a leather two-piece?

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.568
I thought you were gonna show me
how to get it done?

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:41.404
Well, why don't you go
and bury yourself in the sand?

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.703
Well, here comes somebody now.

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.841
You wanna actually
get in that car?

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:51.907
Why don't you go check for me?

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:58.358
Oh man,
we really need a ride.

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:00.087
Uh, where are you guys going?

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.288
Uh, we're trying
to get to Vegas. Vegas.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:05.821
We're going to Buffalo Bill's
You guys can hop in.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:08.994
- Yeah.
- You gotta bring that little...

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:11.732
that little Shirley Temple-
looking thing with you.

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:16.623
Oh yeah, totally. You can...
whatever you want. You can have her.

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.770
- Yeah.
- Get in.

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.142
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:22.648
- All righty, partay.
- Whew.

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.343
Thank you

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:27.944
...on Friday,
August 12th at 2:00 p.m.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.752
All you gotta do is call
the studio between the hours

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.793
of 8:00 and 10:00 p.m
Pacific Standard Time.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.328
I'm not sure we should have
left the others.

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:36.886
Oh, don't worry
We'll be fine.

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.954
What's the worst that
could happen, right?

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.466
A lot of discussion on the table

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.866
about what they're gonna do
to expand the runway.

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.235
Let me tell you...
last week, we had...

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:49.174
Y'all must be getting hot and sweaty
with all that leather down there.

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:53.111
You guys want some beer?
We got a bunch of that shit right here.

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:56.115
- Oh, boo boo.
- Thank you. I am so thirsty right now.

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.742
- Yoo! Thank you.
- No problem.

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:01.048
But they're kinda hot, though, man.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.112
Whoo, hot damn!

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:06.648
- Yeah!
- Oh yeah.

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.423
This is a song we made
so much sweet love to,

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.795
you can't even imagine it.

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:14.630
- Ugh.
- Had plenty of practice with this boy.

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:15.998
Hey now.

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:21.840
- Oh, y'all want a joint?
- Puff puff pass.

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:24.468
- No, I'm good.
- No thanks.

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.376
I... I had quite a night last night.

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.979
More for us to smoke and to drive.

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:32.678
What are y'all supposed to be, anyways?
Sonny and Cher?

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.822
- Who are they?
- Are you kidding with me?

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:42.351
Who is Sonny and Cher? I should come
back there and kick your fucking ass.

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:49.194
Smoking and driving
is funning.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.204
Yeah, you sure
that's the best idea?

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.797
- You want me to drive your car, man?
- Hey, I pride myself?

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.933
On how we done got it ourselves
This guy

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:59.036
at a gas station...
he left it.

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.741
And the next thing you know,
me and the lady here

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.182
hopped right in, boom!
Outta there.

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.583
You stole this car
or it's your car?

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:08.053
I didn't steal shit, man

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.418
I didn't steal a damn thing

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:12.482
I settled into these
nice leather seats.

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.721
- Yeah, these things got seat warmers.
- Yeah.

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:17.161
This thing has the coolest.

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:19.563
Star-Trekking
motherfucking gadget

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.498
button-pushing thing
in front here.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:25.027
You press a button, it talks.
It says a bunch of shit to you

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:28.097
I call him Carl
I say to Carl...

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:30.507
I say, "Carl,
where are we going?"

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:33.172
And he starts yippering
and yappering. Like watch

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:35.738
Carl, how far to Buffalo Bill's?

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.376
100 miles.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.851
Isn't that cool?

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:42.320
Man, I'm gonna get arrested
before I even get to Vegas.

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:43.583
You ain't gonna get arrested.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:45.420
You ain't gonna get
arrested for anything.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.859
And now we've got that
full back seat back there.

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.362
- That's right, we do.
- You have any other shit in the trunk

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:52.262
besides your bags?

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.392
There might be a goat in the trunk.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.364
A... a goat?
A live goat?

01:14:57.426 --> 01:15:00.669
Well, it may not be alive any more.

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:03.175
But it was alive when

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:05.508
we put it in the trunk.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.274
Yahoo!

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.983
All right, all right, hey!

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.022
Sonny and Cher!

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.250
Yoo-hoo.

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.588
Sackajaweenis
and Pocahotness, hey.

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:20.820
Y'all wake up.

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.757
Are we at Buffalo Bill's?

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:28.495
Yeah.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.503
We... fuck,
we have to get a cab.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:33.096
Oh no, we brought you
all the way here.

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:36.438
Yeah, the missus here
wanted to see Paris

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:39.172
and there ain't any way
we're actually gonna do that,

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.441
so this is as good as it gets.

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.176
Oh man!

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.081
Are you kidding me?
That's awesome!

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.949
- Thanks so much, man.
- Hell yeah!

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:50.223
Oh fuck.

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.486
Oh yeah, there was... sorry.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.653
We hit a lot of bumps
on the way here.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:56.992
Your titty must have
just popped right out.

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:59.658
- Really?!
- Yeah, really.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.632
Totally totally.

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:03.863
Hey, you guys have
a nice wedding, all right?

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.701
Yep, thanks, man.

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:07.866
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:16.943
Okay, you gotta get in the shower
because we're gonna be late.

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:19.007
But I still need to go
get a suit though.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:21.111
No you don't.

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:25.083
When did you guys get here?

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:27.991
Oh no, not... not...
like how long... like an hour!

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:29.461
Where the hell
have you been, huh?

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:41.399
Hey, I finally made it.

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:44.740
Yeah, long story, but I look great.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.671
How's it going over there?

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:51.149
Oh good!
All right, good luck. See you soon!

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:52.879
Gotta go to the wedding!

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.682
Toodle-loo, lady!

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.416
See you there.

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:58.116
Good luck, Wyatt!

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.524
Buh... bye!

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.061
Bye.

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:08.293
- You're not coming down to the bar?
- No.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.268
I need to talk to Wyatt.

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:11.963
That's my girl!

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:15.467
I'm so hot in this suit.

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:17.373
Too hot!

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:19.571
Too hot... why am I so hot

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.775
- in this suit? Sexy.
- Hey, get out of here.

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.749
You heard the lady.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.877
Come on, move it, huh?

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:28.853
You see this, right?
I'm not the only one.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:31.220
- Oh, good-looking dude.
- Oh, get out of here with that.

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:33.555
Hey, no hooking up
in the shower, all right?

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.162
Where is everybody?

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.637
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.810
Wait a minute...
wait wait, I can't do that.

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:56.110
Um...

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:59.380
I'm about to go break up
a wedding and I can't do that

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:02.320
I've loved you practically all my life

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:04.687
and I can't live a lie anymore.

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.589
What do you expect me
to say to that?

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:08.958
Just say how you feel.

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.623
At least then I'll know the truth

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.928
I do, I love you so much

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:16.401
but I love you
as a friend, you know?

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:20.804
That's not enough?

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:34.142
It was a great trip
and a fun ride over the years.

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.417
Take care of yourself, okay?

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.354
Wait

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:43.191
I need you now more than ever

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:46.563
I've heard that before

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:48.862
I just... I wish you meant it.

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:23.036
You pull me in, I pull away.

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:27.233
And you ask why
I don't stay longer.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.310
Hey, what can I get you, buddy?

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.212
- A shot of Jack.
- You got it.

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.717
What took you so damn long?

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.054
- She's gone.
- Who?

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.523
Ellen.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.582
She told me she loved me

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:49.094
and I rejected her.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:52.928
Idiot. You two are
meant for each other.

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.490
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.331
I could have used
this information, you know?

01:19:56.391 --> 01:20:00.032
Would you have listened?
We drove all the way out here

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:04.635
hoping that this whole thing
would come to a head finally.

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:07.270
- No pun intended.
- All I know

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:09.281
is I came out here
to break up a wedding

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:12.011
and that's exactly
what I intend to do.

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:14.519
You're sure that's
what you want to do?

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:16.749
Yes.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.553
Then break a leg.

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:21.756
Yes.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.263
You're saying words
I want to hear...

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:48.347
Y'all may be seated.

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.989
First off,

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:55.620
I'd like to say congratulations

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:59.029
to Billy and Katie.

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:01.363
This guy must have a huge cock

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.425
because he's as ugly as sin

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.738
I'd like to say thank you

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:11.073
to the parents,
family members and friends

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:14.272
for being here today.

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.008
We've all come together

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:19.882
"for one common thing"

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:24.151
the love these two individuals

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:26.522
have for one another.

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:29.653
It's been called
life's greatest adventure?

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.495
Marriage.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.933
What is marriage

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:37.527
might you ask.

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:40.471
It has but one meaning.

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:45.802
To share the rest
of your lives together.

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:52.380
At one time

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.387
you were given life individually.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.189
Now...

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:02.289
together

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.387
as one.

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:10.392
Before we embark
on this miracle

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.703
I must ask

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.709
if there's anyone here
who objects to this marriage?

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.802
What's he waiting for?

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.574
Together!

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.411
Uh-Oh.

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:25.178
Look who's here.

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:36.222
Let us call now
on Psalm number three...

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.059
I object.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.690
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- No way.

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:48.467
Wyatt!
What are you doing here?

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:51.204
I never thought I'd see you again.

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.080
Thattaboy.

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:03.019
Young man, is there something
you wanted to say?

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.993
Katie, when you find
someone special

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:10.086
that loves you for who you are,

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:14.156
someone who can get behind you
when things get a little confusing,

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:18.102
you know, like they've been lately
a friend...

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:20.036
Wyatt, I haven't stopped
thinking about you since I left

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.200
I knew that I made
a mistake and...

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:27.137
I was doing it for all
the wrong reasons.

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:29.978
I thought I'd know what
to say in this moment,

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:33.485
I mean, I've been thinking about it
a lot over the last few days

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.543
and... I don't know,

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.647
I guess something feels different

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:40.022
I mean, here I am down here

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:42.459
and you're up there

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.861
and I wanted so badly to be...

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.899
up there.
And that's why I came.

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.993
To stop this and to show you that
we're meant to be together.

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:52.504
Oh, Wyatt, I...

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.437
I love you

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.999
I can't believe you came for me.

01:23:57.065 --> 01:24:00.342
But when I started practicing and saying
all the things I was going to say,

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.483
I realized it doesn't fit.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:06.314
- But...
- The person in my head

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.444
wasn't you at all.

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:11.149
She just ran out the door

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.858
I'm sorry.

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.395
This was wrong.

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:18.260
I'm sorry.

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:23.828
- What?
- Wyatt, you fucking asshole!

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.894
How could you do this to her?

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.600
How could you do this to me?

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:37.580
Ellen!

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:42.714
C'mere.

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:45.815
I stood up at the wedding
and I couldn't do it.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.690
- All I could think about was you.
- So you ruined her wedding?

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.321
Well, it was worth it, I think.

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.457
- You think?
- Well, it depends on how you respond.

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:56.127
- How should I respond?
- Um...

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:57.864
"I love you"
would do the trick

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.270
I just... I don't throw
that word around loosely.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.767
Not the reaction
you were hoping for?

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:07.905
- Not exactly.
- Well,

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:10.779
maybe if you say it to me,
I might say it back.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.451
I love you so much

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:15.954
I love you too.

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:22.051
Oh, Wyatt, ahem.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:24.791
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.332
Hey, guys, hi.

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:29.197
Yeah, so, um, congratulations.

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:31.999
- Thank you.
- 'Cause yeah, no hard feelings, 'kay?

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.097
- Yes.
- That's really relieving.

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:36.608
Because I was kinda feeling
like a real horse's dick.

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:38.075
Mm-hmm, yeah?

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.579
- Ah, Jeez, ow.
- You come here

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:43.275
after I haven't seen you
in fucking forever,

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:45.579
and pull that shit?

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.246
In front of my family
and my new husband?!

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:51.813
- Stop, ow!
- Then you ruin my fucking wedding!

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.383
I hate you!

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:57.225
- Oh, my nose is broken.
- Are you okay?

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.458
Oh man.

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:01.762
Oh my God

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:04.633
I am so glad I did not marry her.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.137
Yeah.

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.475
Oh man, and I'm glad
you're here.

01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:11.477
Can we please go get
a drink right now?

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:13.137
Yes, baby, we can.

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:14.839
- Let's go.
- You called me baby.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:19.851
Hear the words I want to say.

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:22.912
Dying to communicate.

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:25.821
Stuck inside this breakdown

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.918
I want to say it,
but can't get it out.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:43.843
Good morning, campers!

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:45.036
Come on!

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:46.635
It's time to roll your rucksacks

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:49.477
and stow your tent poles
Get up, get up!

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.107
Get up!

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.015
Huh? We have
a long way back home.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:58.320
You won some money last night
Do you remember?

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.188
No. How much?

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:02.990
5,000. And...

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:06.794
we just have enough left
for a lovely candlelight dinner.

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:09.300
Just enough?
Did I gamble it all away?

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:11.894
No no, come on

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:16.405
Wyatt?!

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:19.536
- What?
- What the hell is this?

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.610
Oh my God, it's gorgeous.

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.208
Like I said, just enough left.

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:27.412
Huh?

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:33.723
- I'm glad you like it.
- I love double weddings.

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:43.024
Oh God, no no no!

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:46.231
Of all the stinky tuna fish
in the world, it had to be you!

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:49.207
Oh God, what did I do
to deserve this?

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.471
- Karma's a bitch!
- I'm gonna be sick.

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:54.338
So sick.

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:57.713
If this is not some hillbilly shit
I do not know what is.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.412
Well, come on, come on, let's go.

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.955
We have a long way back home.

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.354
Come on, get up.

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:06.153
Okay.

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.490
I have the wedding pictures.

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:10.426
And they're driving home with me.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.561
- There are pictures?!
- Yeah.

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:16.761
- Pictures?
- Uh-huh. Goodbye.

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:19.361
- Bye.
- Let's go!

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:48.894
Once a long long time ago in history.

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:53.996
Was born a man unlike
any other I'd seen.

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:58.374
Kicked out of school
for wearing jeans by age 13.

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:03.405
Gang-bangs and naked boys
are his two favorite things.

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:06.418
- Whoa.
- He wants to be.

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:09.683
- Yeah.
- Your fantasy.

01:29:09.744 --> 01:29:13.248
He's not looking for trouble,
but he might blow your brother.

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:16.090
- Whoa.
- He's living the dream.

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:20.064
- Yeah.
- So obscene.

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:25.833
Look out, boys,
he's the queen of the road.

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:32.244
There on his nightstand
lies a dirty magazine.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:36.806
Panties on the floor
and cum stains on the sheets.

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:41.718
A force of nature that can
never be contained, no.

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:46.816
His loins will burn a hole
straight into your brain.

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:49.623
- Whoa.
- He wants to be.

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:53.154
- Yeah.
- Your fantasy.

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:56.668
He's not looking for trouble
but he might blow your brother.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:59.204
- Whoa.
- He's living the dream.

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:03.037
- Yeah.
- So obscene.

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:09.048
Look out, boys,
he's the queen of the road.

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:41.244
Oooh.

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:44.010
That's right.

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:47.985
Come on, you're not
a little curious?

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:52.047
- Mmm, it feels so good.
- Whoa.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:53.786
Yeah.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.632
- Whoa.
- He's the queen of the road.

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:03.191
Yeah.

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:11.004
- Whoa.
- He wants to be.

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:14.672
- Yeah.
- Your fantasy.

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:18.080
He's not looking for trouble
but he might blow your brother.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.676
- Whoa.
- He's living the dream.

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:24.621
- Yeah.
- So obscene.

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:30.561
Look out, boys,
he's the queen of the road
