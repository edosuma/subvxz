WEBVTT

00:26.257 --> 00:27.882
In April 1961,

00:28.291 --> 00:32.963
Yuri Gagarin was the first man to arrive in the Cosmic Space.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.486
The space ship Vostok with Yuri Gagarin onboard

00:36.345 --> 00:38.009
has launched into space.

00:38.802 --> 00:40.808
Where for thousands of years

00:40.878 --> 00:42.728
the imagination of humans

00:43.133 --> 00:45.263
has created a fantastic land,

00:46.393 --> 00:47.745
of the after life.

00:49.209 --> 00:51.913
A place reserved for Angels and God.

00:55.206 --> 00:57.779
Arriving there, on his voyage,

00:57.779 --> 01:00.304
in the Cosmic Space or the Heavens,

01:00.310 --> 01:02.068
Gagarin was asked on his return

01:02.168 --> 01:04.671
by the Soviet Union officials,

01:04.705 --> 01:08.251
if he saw God up there, on his journey.

01:08.804 --> 01:11.193
The official answer was no.

01:13.128 --> 01:15.005
But for hundreds of years,

01:15.173 --> 01:18.468
the Christian artists, theologians and believers

01:18.504 --> 01:21.639
have imagined God existing far away,

01:21.712 --> 01:23.823
in the unknown abyss of sky,

01:24.613 --> 01:27.537
In the unknown depth of the clouds.

01:35.067 --> 01:37.110
Depictions of God

01:37.110 --> 01:39.265
though sometimes forbidden by dogma

01:39.265 --> 01:41.516
have imprinted the image of the Creator

01:41.616 --> 01:43.043
and the place where he exists,

01:43.134 --> 01:45.957
in countless paintings and frescoes.

01:46.598 --> 01:48.352
God, The Father,

01:48.448 --> 01:49.791
is up there,

01:49.849 --> 01:53.875
sitting on the throne of the boundless and tumultuous clouds,

01:53.887 --> 01:57.036
from the heights of creation.

01:58.811 --> 02:04.151
The "US Genesis-1491 Mission" from January 1962,

02:04.151 --> 02:07.537
aims to deepen observation from the Low Earth's orbit,

02:07.537 --> 02:10.506
of the unknown physical phenomena around the Earth,

02:10.806 --> 02:14.235
and the possibility of existence of a supernatural entity,

02:14.235 --> 02:18.208
assumed to God, on a location near our planet.

02:18.526 --> 02:22.796
My name is William Florescu, the astronaut of this mission.

02:23.152 --> 02:26.125
My father was an immigrant from Romania.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.194
I will be the fifth astronaut

02:28.720 --> 02:31.025
to see the Earth from Space.

02:31.148 --> 02:35.318
Gagarin, Shepard, Grissom, Titov were there before me.

02:35.369 --> 02:37.391
But I will spent the longest time,

02:37.391 --> 02:40.253
alone there, in Space, until now.

02:41.089 --> 02:43.921
But not much will be known about my mission.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.438
Because it has a special secret purpose.

02:49.438 --> 02:54.632
My job is to find if something extraordinary is happen in the outer space.

02:54.976 --> 03:00.289
Something supernatural, divine, mysterious, inexplicable.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.307
If anyone is living there.

03:02.652 --> 03:05.237
If there is a God,

03:05.416 --> 03:09.606
somewhere above us ...

03:12.699 --> 03:26.996
THE ASTRONAUT OF GOD

03:55.461 --> 03:57.113
Genesis 1491!

03:57.638 --> 04:00.905
Here is Cape Canaveral transmitting in the blind!

04:02.484 --> 04:05.876
We ask you to confirm Omni Bravo, if you copy us!

04:05.964 --> 04:10.196
Genesis 1491, you may hear us!

04:10.854 --> 04:12.950
Confirm your location visually!

04:13.087 --> 04:14.785
Radiolocation is getting worse!

04:15.465 --> 04:17.678
We loose contact ...

04:18.241 --> 04:20.367
We don't know at this time the reason.

04:20.630 --> 04:24.059
I'm afraid is a C.S.O error, during launching,

04:24.254 --> 04:26.269
but not sure.

04:27.967 --> 04:31.871
Please confirm message reception!

04:40.400 --> 04:46.903
In a moment the ridges of the clouds merge with the glow of the ruins,
of the old abbey,

04:48.232 --> 04:52.784
and everything becomes like a painting by Gaugain;

04:54.360 --> 04:58.258
"Who are we?

04:58.546 --> 05:02.926
Where do we come from?

05:03.148 --> 05:07.460
Where are we heading?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.544
Roger Mission Control!

05:19.638 --> 05:25.174
Here's Genesis 1491, I'm over Honduras, approximately,

05:25.174 --> 05:26.852
All systems go!

05:27.227 --> 05:32.546
It got hot around here but I'm going to turn off the ventilation manually.

05:34.223 --> 05:36.504
The C.O.2 level is low.

05:36.875 --> 05:41.266
Cab is at 14 psi, oxygen flows normally.

05:42.126 --> 05:45.576
But I'm about to orbit in the dark.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.307
Roger Genesis 1491!

05:48.471 --> 05:51.754
we hope to remedy the problem with radiolocation soon.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.846
To have you on the radar again.

05:58.126 --> 06:01.032
How is the view, up there William?

06:08.463 --> 06:13.386
Through the capsule's porthole, the blue Earth appears frail.

06:16.850 --> 06:23.613
Fine stretches of water like synapses, mountain chains and layers of clouds.

06:25.224 --> 06:27.112
Lovely view.

06:29.637 --> 06:33.774
But I turn my head and my gaze is absorbed,

06:34.031 --> 06:36.467
by the deep black of the Space.

06:37.828 --> 06:40.316
It feels like an infinity.

06:42.144 --> 06:45.626
What's there, so far away?

06:47.064 --> 06:50.450
Heaven, hell, God is here?

06:50.847 --> 06:52.174
There?

06:52.176 --> 06:57.788
In the same Universe and time with us?

07:02.219 --> 07:06.357
"An infinite Universe of worlds?

07:07.613 --> 07:10.579
Like Giordano Bruno believed.

07:11.656 --> 07:17.981
Before it was burned at the stake by Inquisition.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.903
The darkness has come.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.127
I'm alone.

07:40.225 --> 07:42.769
When I accepted this mission,

07:42.769 --> 07:45.534
I knew I should never loose my lucidity.

07:46.887 --> 07:50.179
Because there, in the Cosmic Space,

07:50.179 --> 07:52.658
the perceptions are different.

07:54.610 --> 07:58.690
The body and brain are deprived of gravity and air,

07:59.980 --> 08:07.222
and possible hallucinations, depression or other forms of unknown disease,
can occur quickly.

08:08.775 --> 08:13.200
Vision is affected by cosmic radiation.

08:14.558 --> 08:17.204
The reality becomes different.

08:20.294 --> 08:23.652
The first orbit around the Earth begins.

08:23.924 --> 08:30.866
The Mission Time is 23 minutes, 28 seconds.

08:40.414 --> 08:43.796
Genesis 1491, here's Mission Control,

08:43.796 --> 08:46.646
transmitting in the blind from the ground.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.922
The radiolocation is not working!

08:52.438 --> 08:55.530
Genesis 1491, if you copy,

08:55.530 --> 08:57.961
confirm message reception!

08:58.750 --> 09:02.979
You have still 4 hours and 34 minutes of the mission.

09:03.723 --> 09:07.144
We cannot locate you at the moment!

09:08.037 --> 09:10.400
Confirm visually your location!

09:10.768 --> 09:13.576
Genesis 1491, answer!

09:14.795 --> 09:18.806
Mission Control, here is Genesis 1491,

09:18.990 --> 09:21.924
signal is weak but I can hear you.

09:24.179 --> 09:30.006
I'm in the dark approximately orbiting over the South China Sea.

09:32.761 --> 09:36.077
When will you fix the radiolocation?

09:38.072 --> 09:41.751
Genesis 1491, the boys are working on it.

09:42.037 --> 09:46.485
Anyway, until you get back into the atmosphere we will be ready.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.835
If not you will go manually.

09:49.918 --> 09:52.826
Right now you can deal it without us.

09:55.281 --> 09:58.123
William, your pulse in at 80 beats per minute.

09:58.718 --> 10:00.270
Blood pressure is good.

10:00.688 --> 10:04.402
The biometric data we receive is ok.

10:04.514 --> 10:07.750
We also have an electrocardiogram.

10:08.143 --> 10:11.262
Looks like you like the space.

10:13.157 --> 10:14.826
Ok.

10:17.834 --> 10:24.072
Genesis 1491, you should start A.S.C.S. test on manual control.

10:25.647 --> 10:27.861
Roger, Mission Control!

10:28.037 --> 10:30.479
Change on manual pitching.

10:32.436 --> 10:35.197
Roger, manual pitching.

10:38.391 --> 10:40.393
Pitching is ok.

10:44.993 --> 10:48.639
The launch day was on Thursday.

10:51.233 --> 10:55.280
At 14:34 hour and 8 seconds.

10:57.173 --> 11:00.916
The weather forecast was perfect.

11:01.402 --> 11:04.170
The day was perfect.

11:07.658 --> 11:11.285
What will I find?

11:12.832 --> 11:17.242
Will I return safely, to Earth?

11:18.557 --> 11:23.668
What will be the results of my research?

11:26.128 --> 11:31.576
My discoveries could change the humanity forever.

11:34.979 --> 11:39.228
Now I live the emotion of mission to the fullest

11:39.228 --> 11:43.112
and all those thoughts make me anxious.

12:02.259 --> 12:09.205
The capsule I am in now travels into orbit at 16000 mph.

12:09.205 --> 12:14.623
A full orbit of the capsule around the Earth takes 88 minutes.

12:18.892 --> 12:22.036
If everything goes as planned.

12:43.318 --> 12:46.764
A mere contemplation of the celestial vault,

12:46.764 --> 12:50.306
is sometimes enough to trigger an experience.

12:50.308 --> 12:56.671
But to orbit around the Earth is something reserved for a demigod.

12:57.706 --> 13:01.703
Everything on Earth- the Romanian people believed,

13:01.703 --> 13:06.225
- is born and dies; No one can stop this.

13:06.735 --> 13:09.288
What is in sky is eternal;

13:09.288 --> 13:15.030
there is the good place: with light, with trees and with sweetness;

13:15.208 --> 13:17.951
there, God is close.

13:18.115 --> 13:21.969
And on some days of the year the sky opens,

13:21.969 --> 13:26.208
and our world contacts the afterworld"

13:26.613 --> 13:30.072
my father, Dragomir, told me.

13:30.207 --> 13:34.041
He had emigrated from Romania, before the Great War.

13:34.738 --> 13:40.039
He had worked on the railways and never had flew with a plane.

13:40.134 --> 13:46.417
Like for millenia man did not reach above the height of the mountains.

13:46.854 --> 13:52.816
Today the sky has opened for me.

13:55.660 --> 14:01.904
Genesis 1491, if all systems go, you can start the visual observation.

14:03.046 --> 14:06.996
Mission Control, yes, all systems are go.

14:08.436 --> 14:11.428
I start shooting.

14:34.456 --> 14:39.024
My task is to document in physical parameters,

14:39.024 --> 14:42.704
any unusual experience that might take place,

14:42.704 --> 14:45.776
in this new environment for man,

14:47.959 --> 14:50.316
while orbiting the Earth.

14:55.170 --> 14:58.664
To film any anomaly or mysterious fact,

14:58.664 --> 15:03.487
that is happening in this forbidden space for man, until now.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.581
Up there, where gods are living.

15:10.581 --> 15:16.211
Like a mystical explorer of the sacred mountains of Tibet or Olympus,

15:16.366 --> 15:21.880
or Hara Berezaiti, the mountain of Zarathrusta,

15:22.035 --> 15:26.417
around which the stars and planets revolve.

15:36.279 --> 15:41.829
I am where no one was until now.

15:43.296 --> 15:45.713
Further to gravity.

15:46.463 --> 15:48.885
To the stars.

15:49.919 --> 15:55.915
I'm an astronaut. And I'm searching ...

16:01.559 --> 16:04.729
But nothing special happens yet.

16:10.142 --> 16:15.634
I only feel the traces of cosmic radiation when I close my eyes,

16:15.634 --> 16:21.474
and small colored sparks cross the blackness of my eyelids.

16:21.997 --> 16:26.532
And my head seems a little swollen but it doesn't hurt.

16:32.672 --> 16:38.559
The Mission Time is 38 minutes, 9 seconds.

16:39.362 --> 16:44.296
And I found nothing or no one here.

16:46.299 --> 16:49.811
William, we thought you should relax a bit.

16:50.156 --> 16:53.403
Emma is going to tell you something.

16:55.369 --> 16:56.802
Ok.

17:00.818 --> 17:03.079
"When all the stars are sown

17:03.079 --> 17:05.603
Across the night-blue space,

17:06.184 --> 17:08.885
With the immense unknown,

17:08.885 --> 17:11.580
In silence face to face.

17:11.969 --> 17:15.071
We stand in speechless awe

17:15.315 --> 17:17.678
While Beauty marches by,

17:17.678 --> 17:19.601
And wonder at the Law

17:19.601 --> 17:23.020
Which wears such majesty."

17:25.464 --> 17:29.212
My colleagues asked me to recite a little.

17:29.337 --> 17:32.775
I think it fits perfectly, up there.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.204
Yes. It's Bliss Carman.

17:36.204 --> 17:38.423
Nice from you, Emma.

17:38.733 --> 17:41.563
I continue to shoot.

17:41.565 --> 17:43.177
I need more filming.

17:45.158 --> 17:48.098
Be carefull, William!

18:05.655 --> 18:09.381
I want to come back with great results.

18:10.737 --> 18:14.100
I need to find out something ...

18:20.521 --> 18:22.394
But nothing.

18:35.563 --> 18:37.656
I'm in Space

18:38.611 --> 18:42.812
and I see nothing which not be prepared at ground.

18:43.626 --> 18:47.547
Which I hadn't imagined in so many white nights.

18:47.989 --> 18:50.159
Which weren't be planned.

18:50.159 --> 18:53.016
It's exactly what I wanted.

18:53.198 --> 18:55.513
But it's hard for me.

18:55.590 --> 19:00.131
Some insidious feeling of abandonment lurks in me.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.726
The Earth is beautiful.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.197
But so alone.

19:05.755 --> 19:07.347
Like me.

19:08.718 --> 19:11.181
I’m waiting.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.348
There has to be more here.

19:14.926 --> 19:17.784
Something, someone ...

19:24.811 --> 19:28.332
One day we will be ruins.

19:31.151 --> 19:34.483
And the stars will fade out.

19:37.149 --> 19:41.480
But, we'll look further.

19:44.192 --> 19:48.050
An astronaut is always searching.

19:49.179 --> 19:50.999
I am the Astronaut.

20:02.933 --> 20:05.540
I am orbiting over Egypt.

20:05.540 --> 20:09.684
But, I don't see the pyramids from Space.

20:11.844 --> 20:16.262
On the control panel I have painted the"Horus's eye".

20:17.108 --> 20:22.225
The one that protects and gives health to the navigators.

20:23.205 --> 20:27.005
Now, I am a free spirit and I travel through the sky,

20:27.044 --> 20:29.686
like Thoth, on Ra's boat.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.620
Thoth, the god with the head of ibis,

20:34.891 --> 20:39.135
the one who made the calculations to establish the heavens,

20:39.635 --> 20:43.753
the stars, the Earth and all that is in them.

20:47.142 --> 20:50.429
Knowledge should not be possessed by humans.

20:50.705 --> 20:53.526
It is the apex of the gods.

20:53.999 --> 20:57.527
"Thoth's Book" should never be known.

20:58.492 --> 21:04.605
The secret science of communicating with animals and understanding the gods.

21:04.741 --> 21:09.362
That, would have told me 4 millennia ago, in Ancient Egypt,

21:09.411 --> 21:14.274
if I had gone sent by a rebel pharaoh on such a quest.

21:25.809 --> 21:28.435
I'm still shooting.

21:34.315 --> 21:35.218
What the !?...

21:46.416 --> 21:48.159
What the heck!

21:52.258 --> 21:57.335
Mission Control, I hear beating outside the capsule!

21:58.011 --> 22:01.702
Genesis 1491, repeat, please!

22:02.268 --> 22:09.274
Mission Control, something or someone hit the capsule cockpit 4 times, repeatedly!

22:09.822 --> 22:11.018
Roger.

22:11.018 --> 22:14.736
Genesis 1491. Start shooting.

22:14.736 --> 22:18.501
I already do it ...

22:18.512 --> 22:20.571
Mission Control, what can it be?

22:20.576 --> 22:23.042
Probably a collision with a group of meteors.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.703
There may be more of them.

22:26.253 --> 22:30.239
Negative, Mission Control, I didn't see anything on porthole.

22:30.239 --> 22:32.038
Are you still hearing it?

22:32.348 --> 22:34.395
It's quiet now.

22:34.475 --> 22:36.948
I start check all systems.

22:40.364 --> 22:42.194
All systems go.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.421
Oxygen is fine.

22:44.421 --> 22:48.643
Batteries are at 80%. CO 2 is a bit high, but.

22:49.465 --> 22:51.663
Roger Genesis 1491.

22:51.976 --> 22:54.304
Start the ventilation manually.

22:54.586 --> 22:58.910
You should lower your CO2 level until you return to atmosphere.

22:59.039 --> 23:01.180
You still have to stay.

23:17.903 --> 23:19.457
What the !?

23:22.136 --> 23:24.189
What the heck!

23:25.138 --> 23:26.538
Damn it!

23:32.919 --> 23:34.319
Damn it!

23:34.793 --> 23:36.255
I was hit!

23:38.120 --> 23:39.565
It's an asteroid!

23:40.891 --> 23:43.439
I have to stabilize the capsule!

23:48.628 --> 23:52.093
Genesis 1491, what happened?

23:52.093 --> 23:54.190
What are your flying data?

23:54.956 --> 23:58.319
Genesis 1491, do you copy us?

24:00.961 --> 24:03.061
I was able to film it, yeah...

24:06.501 --> 24:10.928
Mission Control, it's hard for me to estimate the dimensions,

24:10.928 --> 24:12.979
but smaller than the capsule.

24:12.979 --> 24:15.591
Mission Control, I loose oxygen!

24:15.864 --> 24:17.384
It's an emergency!

24:18.947 --> 24:20.824
William, do you copy?

24:22.008 --> 24:24.656
Not great, Mission Control!

24:26.858 --> 24:29.848
Genesis 1491, do you copy?

24:31.061 --> 24:33.362
We don't get signal from you.

24:33.535 --> 24:37.715
Mission Control, I was hit, I'm trying to stabilize A.S.C.S.

24:40.836 --> 24:43.710
Genesis 1491, we do not receive you!

24:44.924 --> 24:48.102
Our data shows you are orbiting far too South.

24:48.271 --> 24:49.598
No!

24:49.794 --> 24:51.967
Capsule trajectory is deflected.

24:51.967 --> 24:54.152
You go to uncontrolled descent!

24:54.692 --> 24:59.006
Genesis 1491 we don't hear you at all!

25:27.303 --> 25:30.103
Mission Control, I confirm, I'm ok.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.516
I'm fine!

25:34.507 --> 25:36.220
I stabilized the capsule.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.975
Mission Control!

25:43.143 --> 25:47.632
Genesis 1491, start the retro thrusters, manually!

25:48.215 --> 25:50.110
Set nose to 34 degrees yawn.

25:50.110 --> 25:50.572
What?!

25:50.586 --> 25:52.899
You have to go on an emergency re-entry.

25:53.148 --> 25:54.620
You get the wrong data!

25:55.197 --> 25:58.836
Our data shows that you entered on drifted trajectory for descent.

25:59.147 --> 26:01.493
With 230m per second.

26:02.723 --> 26:04.592
You're falling, William!

26:04.673 --> 26:07.974
Mission Control, I confirm, I'm ok!

26:09.713 --> 26:11.081
I'm fine!

26:11.081 --> 26:12.529
You get the wrong data.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.349
I stabilized the capsule.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.620
Mission Control!

26:19.822 --> 26:23.045
Genesis 1491, do you copy?

26:25.721 --> 26:30.976
Mission Control, yes, I can hear you! I'm talking! I'm here!

26:32.448 --> 26:34.886
Do you hear me?

26:40.752 --> 26:44.265
Genesis 1491, we do not receive you!

26:44.613 --> 26:48.590
William, our biometric data shows you have a declining pulse.

26:48.590 --> 26:51.686
You approach 40 beats per minute.

26:51.696 --> 26:53.850
Turn on the emergency oxygen!

26:54.550 --> 26:57.949
Mission Control, I don't feel any change.

26:58.187 --> 27:00.451
Maybe a little warm, but ...

27:01.963 --> 27:05.726
William, our data shows us, zero pulse!

27:05.731 --> 27:07.711
William what's going on with you?

27:07.847 --> 27:08.729
Reply!

27:11.888 --> 27:15.449
Mission Control! I'm good! Don't you hear me?

27:16.311 --> 27:19.434
Mission Control, the sensors were probably blown,

27:19.434 --> 27:21.854
after the impact with the asteroids.

27:22.361 --> 27:25.888
Or it's another unknown error.

27:28.139 --> 27:31.291
Genesis 1491, we do not hear you.

27:31.612 --> 27:33.957
Wake up, William!

27:37.346 --> 27:41.081
Puls zero. He went into cardiac arrest.

27:41.081 --> 27:44.061
Already lost his consciousness.

27:45.151 --> 27:47.342
My God ...

27:47.621 --> 27:49.441
William wake up!

27:49.807 --> 27:51.403
William, don't die ...

27:51.553 --> 27:53.031
What the?!

28:01.393 --> 28:06.783
William, wake up ...! Turn on the extra oxygen.

28:07.409 --> 28:12.602
You went into hypoxia. Zero pulse ...

29:08.120 --> 29:10.135
Mission Control, answer!

29:12.232 --> 29:16.138
Mission Control, here astronaut William Florescu,

29:16.438 --> 29:24.686
of US Genesis 1491 mission, on Genesis 1491 ship, do you copy me?

29:31.080 --> 29:34.435
Mission Control, do you hear me?

29:45.347 --> 29:48.713
Mission Control ... I didn't die ... Impossible.

29:48.713 --> 29:51.876
You received incorrect data.

29:53.135 --> 29:56.668
Mission Control ... I'm aware!

30:08.241 --> 30:10.399
Mission Control ...

30:27.680 --> 30:33.128
The Mission Time is 48 minutes, 55 seconds.

30:39.429 --> 30:43.356
William, are you ok?

30:43.391 --> 30:45.782
What's happening to you?

30:46.400 --> 30:48.279
Keep your cold blood.

30:48.279 --> 30:53.794
Lucidity was your guardian angel for so many times.

31:20.985 --> 31:27.529
Mission Control, the Mission Time has blocked at 48 minutes and 55 seconds.

31:32.569 --> 31:36.209
The timer has failed, I think ...

31:38.844 --> 31:43.084
Something happens with temperature sensors, also.

31:44.080 --> 31:51.699
It's a little warm, although, in capsule are only 41 degrees -F.

32:00.039 --> 32:02.247
And my chest hurts a bit,

32:02.982 --> 32:06.394
but I suspect, it's because of the lack of gravity.

32:12.246 --> 32:16.471
I hit my wrist, and my head a little too.

32:32.400 --> 32:36.712
Mission Control, something is happening on the control panel.

32:40.310 --> 32:43.652
I can't reset the communication buttons.

32:43.915 --> 32:46.571
It looks like a short circuit.

32:47.521 --> 32:49.305
Strangely.

32:56.158 --> 32:59.997
I'm afraid it won't be totally interrupted.

33:06.168 --> 33:09.619
Mission Control, I will monitor and record,

33:09.619 --> 33:14.795
the physical parameters outside the capsule, for the next orbit.

33:16.998 --> 33:19.514
According to the mission procedure.

33:19.674 --> 33:22.555
I'm trying to continue the mission.

33:56.142 --> 34:02.308
Mission Control, the oxygen level has been constant for too long.

34:05.247 --> 34:08.636
The gauge has broken too, I suspect ...

34:09.295 --> 34:11.853
Level is not dropping.

34:17.001 --> 34:20.281
It’s not possible to consume nothing!

34:24.074 --> 34:25.793
I am breathing.

34:26.101 --> 34:28.801
Or maybe I don't see well.

34:33.850 --> 34:35.686
I'm going to track it.

34:38.509 --> 34:43.641
The level of carbon dioxide has increased, in the meantime.

34:43.893 --> 34:45.820
I'm a little worried.

34:46.039 --> 34:48.991
Mission Control, I do not know if you copy me,

34:49.031 --> 34:50.338
I do not receive you,

34:50.384 --> 34:55.261
but I will continue to talk about the procedures I perform.

34:59.678 --> 35:03.051
They will be recorded in the mission's log.

35:03.270 --> 35:06.236
I try to record the outdoor data.

35:14.519 --> 35:20.927
Exterior radiation looks stable. About 37-48 Megalectronvolt.

35:21.267 --> 35:25.283
Ionizing radiation, 91mileSiverti.

35:25.568 --> 35:30.713
The temperature about to -58 Fahrenheit,

35:31.447 --> 35:33.852
it got warmed up.

35:36.559 --> 35:42.215
I am orbiting with 17424 miles per hour.

35:42.547 --> 35:47.202
Over 30-35 minutes I reach apsis altitude.

35:49.069 --> 35:53.895
High visibility, 125 degrees.

35:54.514 --> 36:01.141
I filmed about 4 minutes. I have still another one hour of unused reel.

36:19.458 --> 36:21.794
I am still shooting

36:23.388 --> 36:26.274
and taking outside data.

36:30.796 --> 36:34.094
The communication with the Earth has been lost.

36:34.700 --> 36:38.764
I try to continue the mission by myself.

36:40.679 --> 36:43.295
What else, could I do?

36:47.633 --> 36:49.910
I continue to search.

36:53.651 --> 36:55.982
But, nothing special ...

37:01.330 --> 37:03.898
Maybe it's an answer.

37:37.661 --> 37:40.423
I'm not feeling well.

37:45.352 --> 37:52.567
I have a pulse in my left hand, on my fingers.

38:03.449 --> 38:07.562
How did Bruno's inquisitors sign his death sentence?

38:08.137 --> 38:12.613
Holding firmly fingers around the pen?

38:14.860 --> 38:18.931
With shaking hands, with doubts?

38:22.431 --> 38:27.554
I probably did a stretching of the tendons of the fingers.

38:28.773 --> 38:33.185
I don't have too much power when I clench my fist.

38:34.275 --> 38:37.300
I need to focus.

38:44.569 --> 38:48.622
Mission Control, our communication is still recorded

38:51.601 --> 38:54.946
even if you don't copy.

38:55.195 --> 38:57.697
I will continue speaking ...

39:13.273 --> 39:14.393
But ...

39:17.975 --> 39:20.591
I'm starting to have ...

39:21.049 --> 39:23.059
some kind ...

39:24.563 --> 39:26.966
of visions,

39:43.373 --> 39:45.713
I don't know …

39:46.251 --> 39:47.975
something happens to me,

39:48.193 --> 39:51.005
when I close my eyes I see,

39:57.740 --> 39:59.648
I see ...

40:00.210 --> 40:02.196
I see ...

42:31.492 --> 42:35.546
Mission Control, here's Genesis 1491!

42:36.185 --> 42:38.069
Do you copy?

42:38.972 --> 42:43.684
I just heard music outside the capsule!

42:49.043 --> 42:52.325
Mission Control, I hear something out there,

42:53.863 --> 42:59.065
it's a song, it sounds like,

43:00.457 --> 43:03.587
But of course, it can't be music.

43:03.787 --> 43:05.777
There is no sound in Space,

43:05.820 --> 43:10.499
no sound waves can propagate in the cosmic vacuum,

43:14.641 --> 43:17.768
Mission Control ...

43:17.938 --> 43:22.478
something sounded like music. I can't explain ...

43:24.176 --> 43:27.620
Maybe, it was a frequency interference.

43:31.223 --> 43:32.886
It's quiet now.

43:34.586 --> 43:38.892
Very strange.

43:53.605 --> 43:57.419
Mission Control, do you copy?

44:00.300 --> 44:05.178
Mission Control, I am orbiting above Indonesia, approximately.

44:05.550 --> 44:08.215
The flight parameters are restored.

44:09.299 --> 44:12.322
Oxygen is at 44%.

44:12.488 --> 44:14.674
I repressurized the ship.

44:15.117 --> 44:17.716
I have no serious damage.

44:18.143 --> 44:22.835
Maybe, the telecommunication antenna was hit by meteoroids.

44:22.835 --> 44:24.774
I don't know if you hear me ...

44:28.795 --> 44:30.826
Mission Control

44:31.445 --> 44:33.252
I don't hear you.

44:34.451 --> 44:36.453
I'm alone again.

44:36.491 --> 44:38.031
If ...

44:43.724 --> 44:46.378
Blocked, between two worlds.

44:46.975 --> 44:50.477
The Earth and the Deep Black Space.

44:50.540 --> 44:52.674
What should I do?

44:55.473 --> 44:58.593
I cancel, yes, I come back.

44:59.644 --> 45:02.733
Enough of this, there's nothing here.

45:02.920 --> 45:06.640
Just an hostile and strange place.

45:10.660 --> 45:14.432
Mission Control, I’m transmitting in the blind.

45:14.634 --> 45:17.980
Mission Control, if you somehow receive me,

45:18.063 --> 45:23.280
you must know that I have start the procedure of reentry into the atmosphere.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.302
Due to the strange events that happened,

45:26.302 --> 45:29.035
and the lack of communication with the Earth,

45:29.035 --> 45:31.330
I cannot continue the mission.

45:33.010 --> 45:35.596
I finish the mission earlier.

45:35.828 --> 45:38.770
I'm sorry, I don't have great results.

45:39.336 --> 45:42.054
Just a concussion on the head.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.316
I'm comming home

46:09.749 --> 46:14.181
Yes, I'm leaving here. I'm returning home.

46:15.720 --> 46:21.687
In about 15 minutes I estimate I get the atmosphere re-enter window.

46:28.782 --> 46:29.918
What the hell?

46:40.339 --> 46:42.063
Mission Control

46:43.803 --> 46:47.432
the Automatic Positioning System no longer works.

46:58.219 --> 47:02.895
A wave of galactic radiation melted the circuits.

47:03.831 --> 47:05.038
Damn it!

47:13.746 --> 47:15.900
Some chip. Maybe.

47:16.779 --> 47:19.382
I have no other explanation ...

47:30.129 --> 47:32.622
I do not know what happened.

47:32.718 --> 47:35.201
Where did this wave came from.

47:45.831 --> 47:46.552
Maybe

47:46.552 --> 47:49.241
it's a Solar blast.

48:07.336 --> 48:09.080
What the hell!

48:09.080 --> 48:13.042
There are 3 minutes until I return to Earth's atmosphere.

48:14.225 --> 48:15.835
The trajectory is good,

48:15.835 --> 48:18.474
I remain on manual control.

48:22.219 --> 48:23.648
But!

48:32.068 --> 48:32.770
But ...

48:32.770 --> 48:36.378
something stands out at the window!

48:36.846 --> 48:40.476
Something is going on outside the capsule!

48:52.800 --> 48:55.330
I do not know what this is.

48:57.500 --> 49:01.871
It could be a radiation globe or something else.

49:01.939 --> 49:05.133
A plasma body, better said.

49:05.853 --> 49:07.541
A radiating globe.

49:07.841 --> 49:10.134
Something completely new ...

49:11.797 --> 49:13.962
and unknown.

49:15.429 --> 49:18.137
Or ... an entity.

49:18.377 --> 49:19.667
Something allien.

49:20.067 --> 49:22.076
Maybe alive.

49:28.247 --> 49:31.779
It's difficult to appreciate the distance,

49:31.779 --> 49:34.154
I have no landmarks,

49:34.442 --> 49:40.917
and the shape or the entity seems to be moving towards the capsule.

49:48.028 --> 49:50.351
I have to get closer!

49:50.412 --> 49:52.624
I change my position manually.

49:52.927 --> 49:54.184
I'm getting closer.

49:54.845 --> 49:56.073
With any risk!

49:56.371 --> 49:58.082
I’m recording!

49:58.097 --> 50:00.749
It's extraordinary!

50:08.409 --> 50:10.849
It is an unnatural presence

50:10.849 --> 50:13.986
somewhere at 28 degrees port of capsule

50:14.706 --> 50:16.143
I have to shoot!

50:16.396 --> 50:17.910
Mission Control!

50:25.164 --> 50:29.355
It is an evolving form, Mission Control,

50:29.355 --> 50:31.725
similar to a butterfly of small size,

50:35.161 --> 50:39.137
that radiates in shades of orange.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.955
It's beautifull!

50:53.586 --> 50:55.513
I'm recording.

50:57.327 --> 50:59.433
It's extraordinary.

51:03.892 --> 51:06.023
What is this?

51:40.494 --> 51:43.455
Mission Control, repeat please!

51:45.117 --> 51:47.658
I do not understand!

51:52.028 --> 51:55.645
Mission Control, please repeat!

51:55.859 --> 51:58.522
Mission Control!

52:12.686 --> 52:15.681
Mission Control ...are you?

52:17.034 --> 52:19.703
or ...

52:30.102 --> 52:31.828
Who are you?

52:37.572 --> 52:42.403
Are you trying to comunicate with me?

52:53.174 --> 52:57.110
Is it an audio interference?

53:02.811 --> 53:04.636
What happens?

53:09.295 --> 53:11.374
Mission Control,

53:11.374 --> 53:13.219
the entity I film

53:14.026 --> 53:17.714
affects the audio communication.

53:19.679 --> 53:22.852
Or they try to communicate with me,

53:23.024 --> 53:25.237
I don't realize what is it

53:36.062 --> 53:38.479
But my chest hurts,

53:39.970 --> 53:42.162
harder.

53:42.490 --> 53:44.340
I feel a sting,

53:44.992 --> 53:47.699
in the sternum.

53:48.374 --> 53:53.508
Mission Control, something extraordinary is happening .

53:55.227 --> 53:59.693
Mission Control, something extraordinary is there!

53:59.744 --> 54:01.605
I hope you receive me!

54:07.976 --> 54:11.708
Mission Control, I don't have much time.

54:11.860 --> 54:14.512
The gravity increases.

54:16.684 --> 54:18.908
The Earth attracts me.

54:27.077 --> 54:29.701
I put the retro thrusters on,

54:31.522 --> 54:34.841
I try to keep a little more.

54:39.386 --> 54:41.999
The entity is approaching me.

54:55.997 --> 55:00.636
"No one saw God, at any time”, wrote the Apostle John

55:01.130 --> 55:08.116
And early Christians believed, that no one could see God and live afterwards.

55:10.076 --> 55:12.452
I shot something exceptional.

55:13.953 --> 55:15.514
An entity.

55:15.514 --> 55:22.275
A supernatural being who, maybe was trying to communicate with me.

55:23.059 --> 55:24.358
Alien.

55:24.358 --> 55:25.057
Angelic.

55:25.057 --> 55:26.124
Divine.

55:26.201 --> 55:32.475
Or it is a completely unknown physical phenomenon for science.

55:32.872 --> 55:36.149
But I have proof of existence.

55:37.302 --> 55:38.542
In the Space,

55:38.542 --> 55:42.401
unimaginable things are happening, near our planet.

55:44.371 --> 55:45.913
I have proof.

55:45.988 --> 55:49.468
I have the evidence, for the first time.

55:50.993 --> 55:54.587
Something was happening up, here in the sky,

55:54.587 --> 55:56.682
in the heavens.

56:08.120 --> 56:10.814
Mission Control, I can't keep up

56:10.814 --> 56:13.878
The gravity increases!

56:14.721 --> 56:16.061
I reentry!

56:16.061 --> 56:19.597
My coordinates are ...

56:25.655 --> 56:30.903
Genesis 1491, if you hear us, confirm the reception!

56:31.361 --> 56:37.739
Genesis 1491, we lost radio communication for 21 minutes,

56:46.288 --> 56:50.261
Genesis 1491, do you copy?

57:12.014 --> 57:18.890
Genesis 1491, our biometric data tells us that you are alive now.

57:19.390 --> 57:21.238
You came back!

57:21.525 --> 57:24.200
Your pulse is approaching 90 beats per minute.

57:24.503 --> 57:29.800
Genesis 1491, if you copy us please confirm!

57:29.800 --> 57:34.966
Genesis 1491, if you hear us prepare for re-entry.

57:35.266 --> 57:37.838
We fixed the radiolocation.

57:37.838 --> 57:40.510
You are crossing over the South Atlantic.

57:40.704 --> 57:44.876
You may experience some waves of high radiation.

57:45.127 --> 57:48.069
You are crossing South Atlantic Anomally.

57:48.263 --> 57:53.260
Genesis 1491, the radiolocation is getting worse, again

57:53.260 --> 57:55.272
get ready for ... for

57:56.803 --> 57:59.682
Mission Control, I hardly hear you.

57:59.682 --> 58:01.233
I am alive!

58:01.300 --> 58:03.832
I filmed something extraordinary.

58:04.164 --> 58:07.829
Something supernaturally exists out here.

58:11.270 --> 58:13.085
William, we're glad!

58:13.237 --> 58:17.007
You were in cardiac arrest for 5 minutes.

58:17.179 --> 58:18.947
We thought we lost you.

58:20.314 --> 58:23.416
Mission Control, no, I wasn't.

58:23.555 --> 58:27.389
Mission Control, I shot something extraordinary.

58:27.636 --> 58:29.398
I have the proof.

58:29.398 --> 58:34.318
Of a superior form of existence or some unbelievable phenomena.

58:34.762 --> 58:36.049
William!

58:36.333 --> 58:39.467
William, you were probably in hypoxia.

58:39.744 --> 58:45.136
You’ve had hallucinations due to the high level of breathed carbon dioxide.

58:45.389 --> 58:50.143
You also crossed a huge intensity field of radiation.

58:50.391 --> 58:54.722
The South Atlantic Anomally. Like never before.

58:54.722 --> 58:59.583
Our colleagues from the Institute never recorded such high values!

59:01.368 --> 59:04.631
William, turn on the emergency oxygen!

59:08.140 --> 59:11.798
Misson Control, no, no, I wasn't!

59:14.226 --> 59:17.421
William, get ready for ...

59:19.543 --> 59:23.479
William, the radiolocation is constantly deteriorating.

59:25.087 --> 59:28.130
Something happened again to the system.

59:28.278 --> 59:31.703
We cannot identify the problem now and

59:31.703 --> 59:33.710
We don't know where you are!

59:33.710 --> 59:35.611
And where will you gonna land.

59:35.995 --> 59:39.427
The boys are working on an estimate.

59:39.427 --> 59:43.726
But you moved away from the sea coast landing perimeter.

59:46.909 --> 59:49.573
William, continue the maneuvers.

59:49.779 --> 59:55.117
At 10,000 feet the baroswitch of the main chute will be activated.

59:55.224 --> 59:57.599
If not, do it manually.

59:57.599 --> 01:00:00.324
Or use the backup chute.

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:05.691
William, we are not copy you at the moment ...

01:00:05.691 --> 01:00:07.328
We hope you can handle it.

01:00:07.535 --> 01:00:09.309
You have to.

01:00:09.427 --> 01:00:12.734
Genesis 1491, if you copy us

01:00:13.332 --> 01:00:15.904
Try to not modify the …

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:41.378
William ...

01:00:41.378 --> 01:00:43.148
We are losing you!

01:00:43.148 --> 01:00:46.959
William, you disappeared from the radar.

01:01:15.494 --> 01:01:17.800
All things are in the Universe,

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.764
and the Universe is in all things:

01:01:21.933 --> 01:01:29.111
we in it, and it in us; in this way, everything concurs in perfect unity.

01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:39.588
Giordano Bruno, Cause, Principle. And Unity, 1584

01:01:55.967 --> 01:01:58.787
Later, I understood everything.

01:01:58.967 --> 01:02:02.229
With disappointment and sadness, though.

01:02:02.558 --> 01:02:09.922
I managed to save myself from the emercency re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.

01:02:10.704 --> 01:02:14.201
On January 2, 1962.

01:02:39.135 --> 01:02:46.483
I had serious damage to the space capsule but in the end it survived exceptionally.

01:02:47.037 --> 01:02:52.655
It seems my engineers did a great job with the design.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:04.677
For me a luxurious shoulder, bruises and a psychic state of confusion.

01:03:05.891 --> 01:03:07.832
But I got back.

01:03:14.802 --> 01:03:18.380
I also took the camera, with the precious shooting.

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:26.488
But the film the whole reel to my shock had only recorded a few minutes of flight.

01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:30.259
The rest is empty.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.911
Nothing special on the the cosmic capsule shootings.

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:38.228
No mysterious presence.

01:03:38.456 --> 01:03:46.352
No God, no superior form of extraterrestrial life, no unknown cosmic phenomenon.

01:03:46.878 --> 01:03:49.086
Only the expeditionary filming,

01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:54.519
with the Earth seen from Space from the first minutes of the mission.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.656
6 minutes, 27 seconds.

01:04:01.656 --> 01:04:03.681
Just that.

01:04:08.195 --> 01:04:10.507
I haven't found anything

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:16.611
How was that possible?

01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:28.032
The explanation for that, given by my doctors was,

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:33.878
that after I get hit by the asteroid, the capsule start to loose oxygen.

01:04:33.878 --> 01:04:40.936
I quickly lost consciousness and went into a dangerous state of hypoxia.

01:04:41.255 --> 01:04:48.765
The lack of normal oxygen saturation in blood for the brain and carbon dioxide intoxication,

01:04:48.765 --> 01:04:53.863
produced by own breathing causes strong hallucinations.

01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:56.777
An abnormal mental state in which a person,

01:04:56.777 --> 01:04:59.960
has the illusion of perceiving non-existent things.

01:05:01.961 --> 01:05:06.973
All that I saw was just the product of my imagination,

01:05:08.758 --> 01:05:11.914
of an oxygen-free brain.

01:05:14.028 --> 01:05:16.287
A 21-minute dream.

01:05:16.797 --> 01:05:23.135
Long and strange as the Mission Control lost the radio connection with me.

01:05:28.161 --> 01:05:30.961
I didn't shoot anything out of the ordinary.

01:05:34.582 --> 01:05:36.718
Nothing happened up there.

01:05:36.718 --> 01:05:39.979
Than the unfortunate impact with the asteroid.

01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:41.676
And the strong hallucination,

01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:46.836
due to the lack of appropriate oxygen saturation of the brain.

01:05:48.859 --> 01:05:50.672
I'm a scientist.

01:05:50.672 --> 01:05:53.308
Science got me up there.

01:05:54.878 --> 01:05:58.137
And I find the explanation plausible.

01:06:01.974 --> 01:06:05.305
However, I do not explain how and why,

01:06:05.605 --> 01:06:09.475
I get my consciouness back during the reentry.

01:06:09.685 --> 01:06:11.334
From the blackout.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.852
Maybe it's just luck.

01:06:13.485 --> 01:06:14.885
My destiny.

01:06:20.499 --> 01:06:23.756
The US Genesis 1491 missions,

01:06:23.756 --> 01:06:29.350
and the secret research program of paranormal phenomena in low Earth's orbit,

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:32.720
has not been continued.

01:06:51.252 --> 01:06:58.373
For hundreds of years our telescopes have searched the sky and the stars.

01:07:00.187 --> 01:07:05.685
For now there is no mystery above the clouds near the Earth.

01:07:06.403 --> 01:07:13.008
Just the risky desire of man to get there and look haughty behind.

01:07:13.008 --> 01:07:14.580
From above.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.781
Near the God of the past.

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:23.248
But, there is no God in the cosmic space.

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:26.129
That's what I believe, today.

01:07:31.719 --> 01:07:33.879
I haven't met him.

01:07:35.683 --> 01:07:37.672
Or maybe,

01:07:38.162 --> 01:07:42.307
just as Hamlet cannot meet Shakespeare,

01:07:42.307 --> 01:07:46.121
neither can creation, meet the Creator,

01:07:46.318 --> 01:07:48.672
And man, the God ...

01:07:56.053 --> 01:07:58.948
But I will look further,

01:08:03.004 --> 01:08:06.664
deeper on Space.

01:08:07.368 --> 01:08:12.216
In an infinite Universe of worlds and galaxies.

01:08:12.216 --> 01:08:14.065
Same as Giordano Bruno,

01:08:14.065 --> 01:08:17.720
the medieval monk, believed once.

01:08:17.835 --> 01:08:22.345
Because an astronaut is always searching.

01:08:22.908 --> 01:08:23.831
Further.

01:08:24.046 --> 01:08:26.452
On and on.

01:08:26.452 --> 01:08:28.292
To the stars.

01:08:32.327 --> 01:08:36.288
I am the astronaut of God.

01:08:36.288 --> 01:08:40.988
And I will find the answer ...

01:08:44.234 --> 01:08:48.059
The Mission Time has been reset.
