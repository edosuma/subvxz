I don't understand,
you said you hate camping.

00:07.433 --> 00:09.300
I do,
but Jennifer loves it.

00:09.333 --> 00:10.766
She thinks it's romantic.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.533
This is my chance
to get Jennifer

we have to do

is to figure out

Now, let's just take stock
of our situation, huh?

03:27.400 --> 03:31.200
Now, this happens to be a nice,
safe spot for a camp site.

03:31.833 --> 03:34.366
Isn't it? Yes.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.666
And now, I'm going to be handing
out some assignments seeing

03:37.700 --> 03:39.433
that I'm the camping leader.

03:39.466 --> 03:43.266
First of all, we need somebody
to hunt for nuts and berries.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.466
We need somebody to head up
the firewood committee.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.666
And, uh, one of you people gets
to dig for the good‐luck slug.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
Now, let's take
the, uh, life jackets.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.033
Spread them out to dry.

03:56.066 --> 03:58.333
Now, wait‐wait‐wait.

03:58.366 --> 04:00.466
Why are we
making camp?

04:00.500 --> 04:03.300
All we have to do is
cut across the forest

04:03.333 --> 04:05.400
in...that direction.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.100
And we'll run right into
the other fork of the river.

04:10.133 --> 04:11.800
We'll just follow it down
to the camp site

04:11.833 --> 04:13.466
and we'll be there in time
for the big barbeque

04:13.500 --> 04:14.400
and talent show.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.300
I think that we should stay here

04:17.333 --> 04:19.233
and wait for the search party.

04:19.266 --> 04:20.433
I'm with Balki.

04:20.466 --> 04:21.500
Me too.

04:23.533 --> 04:26.266
Uh, Balki, could I...speak
with you privately.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.400
Oh, sure.

04:28.166 --> 04:29.400
Excuse us.

04:40.466 --> 04:42.533
You have got to let me
lead us out of here.

04:42.566 --> 04:44.300
You have got
to be kidding.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.766

04:54.700 --> 04:57.033
You're the camping leader.

04:57.066 --> 04:59.333
They'll follow me
if you tell them to.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.033

lost their way

05:01.066 --> 05:02.266

05:05.200 --> 05:08.066
But good news, I'm gonna put you
in charge of gathering nuts.

Jennifer's respect back

05:13.266 --> 05:15.033

me again.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.300
If she doesn't trust me

05:16.333 --> 05:17.466
she won't go out
with me anymore.

‐ Well‐‐
‐ And then, we'll drift apart.

a...darling little tike

Oh, cousin, I want
to be an uncle.

to get back to the camp site?

05:59.666 --> 06:02.666
Of course. Nobody can be
wrong all the time.

you've ever taken.

the Beav to pretend

17:32.666 --> 17:33.733

pretended
that they needed help..

maybe he'll get
his confidence back?

Yeah, I was thinking maybe
you could pretend

17:53.733 --> 17:55.766
to be bitten by a snake

17:55.800 --> 17:58.333
and then, and then I could
run and hide in the bushes

wake Cousin Larry up
