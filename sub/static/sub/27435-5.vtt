JUDGE WILKINS: This case
is calendared
for a 12(b) hearing.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.567
The defendant is challenging
the constitutionality

04:02.640 --> 04:04.608
of a search
that led to the discovery

04:04.670 --> 04:06.672
of an unregistered,
defaced firearm

04:06.740 --> 04:09.345
seized from his possession.
Is that correct,
Mr. Reddington?

04:09.410 --> 04:12.140
Yes, Your Honor,
on the grounds that
the search was unreasonable

04:12.210 --> 04:13.973
and therefore a violation
of the Fourth Amendment.

04:14.050 --> 04:16.917
So you are familiar with
Fourth Amendment
Jurisprudence?

04:16.990 --> 04:21.017

04:26.530 --> 04:28.623
to be admitted into
eVIdence against you,

04:28.700 --> 04:30.122
the Government
will consider that

04:30.200 --> 04:32.168
a violation of your
immunity agreement.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.595
And without immunity,

04:33.670 --> 04:36.195
you will be facing
multiple capital offenses.

Your Honor, please.

I'm on pins and needles
as it is,

04:39.940 --> 04:41.373

the matter.

to hire an attorney.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.938

your concern.

It's my obligation to let you
know what you're up against.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.384
A motion to suppress involves
a complex legal analysis,

done by someone

I haven't studied mine?

by Justice Warren
in Terry v. Ohio, I am.

no reason to break this early,

of emergency.

may be in jeopardy,

05:52.650 --> 05:54.015
but while it remains intact,

05:54.080 --> 05:56.947
I intend to live up
to its obligations.

claims the explosion

06:41.900 --> 06:44.425
was a targeted hit
aimed at Van Ness

06:44.500 --> 06:45.922
because he's
supporting Reddington

06:46.000 --> 06:47.797
in ongoing business dealings.
What business?

06:47.870 --> 06:49.963
Van Ness is one
of a group of assocnates,

06:50.040 --> 06:52.679

sever ties with Reddington
because of his arrest.

knocked off for being

06:54.380 --> 06:57.304

to find his killer?

06:57.380 --> 06:59.007

has no idea who did it?

06:59.080 --> 07:00.911
He's got a lot of enemies
who want a piece
of his empire.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.642

the FBI to protect it.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.143

10:26.250 --> 10:28.059
No, no. If you put
the Q and the S
on the triple word score,

10:28.120 --> 10:29.382
it's worth over 300 points.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.382
Did you find out
about Timothy Peterson?

10:32.390 --> 10:35.029
Right. Work.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.965
ARAM: As of the reading
of his father's will,

10:37.030 --> 10:41.160
Tim Peterson is the
511th-richest man in America

10:41.240 --> 10:43.834
and, I'm fairly confident,
the only billionaire

10:43.910 --> 10:46.879
working in a bowling alley
and living in a trailer park.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.077
Looks like that apple

10:48.140 --> 10:49.698
fell a few, uh, light-years
from the tree.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.270
Oh, that's putting it
mildly.

10:51.350 --> 10:55.411
His credit score is 580,
he's $62,000 in debt, and...

10:55.480 --> 10:57.516
He has got
a criminal record.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.013
COOPER:
Unpaid speeding tickets,
public intoxication,

11:00.090 --> 11:02.308
a bar fight that got him
thrown in jail for a week.

11:02.390 --> 11:04.688
It seems like more of
a slacker than a killer.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.058
His inheritance came
as a complete surprise.

11:07.130 --> 11:09.928
Then what motivation would he
have to kill his father
if he didn't know about it?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.319
Well, let's say
he did know.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.766
How does a kid living
in a trailer park
outside Arlington

11:13.840 --> 11:15.637
connect in any way
to Mr. Reddington?

11:15.700 --> 11:18.100
And if he doesn't, why are we
even on this case?

11:18.170 --> 11:20.536
Because something
doesn't add up,
and I want to know why.

11:20.610 --> 11:22.373
Navabi, the people
in his posts,

11:22.440 --> 11:23.577
I want to know
everything about them.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.868
Ressler, Keen,
talk to Peterson.

11:25.950 --> 11:29.010
Find out
what he knew about his
old man and when he knew it.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.379
Well, it didn't take him long
to spend the old man's money.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.213
Sure beats
the trailer park.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.882
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

11:35.960 --> 11:39.259
I've been to
my share of Irish wakes,
but this is ridiculous.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.551
(MAN GRUNTS)

11:41.630 --> 11:45.396
Hate to interrupt Miller Time,
but where's Tim Peterson at?

11:45.470 --> 11:48.598
Hey, Tim!
Hide your cash!

11:48.670 --> 11:52.208
The IRS is already here.
(CHUCKLES)

11:52.270 --> 11:55.637
Tim Peterson.
Agents Ressler, Keen. FBI.

11:55.710 --> 12:00.318
FBI? Don't worry.
The hotel suite
is bought and paid for.

12:00.380 --> 12:03.417
We just have
a few questions surrounding
your father's death.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.549
You and me both.
(PEOPLE CHANTING "CHUG")

12:05.620 --> 12:07.258
(CHEERING)

12:07.320 --> 12:08.958
When was the_ last_time
you spoke With him?

12:09.020 --> 12:11.079
Far as I can recall,
I never spoke to him.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.628
I didn't even know
he was my father
till the lawyer called,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.998
told me to come
to the reading of the will.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.369
What questions
do you have?

12:18.430 --> 12:21.866
Why didn't he get in touch
with me when he was alive?

12:21.940 --> 12:25.103
What kept him from
wanting to get to know me?

12:25.170 --> 12:29.072
And most importantly, why'd
he leave me all this dough?

12:29.140 --> 12:31.540
You don't seem too upset
about him dying.

12:31.610 --> 12:35.148
It's just DNA. Like I said,
I never met the man.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.780
Tim, who are
the late arrivals?

12:37.850 --> 12:39.442
Hey, princess.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.250
These are my new friends
from the FBI.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.289
Hi, new friends
from the FBI.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.850
I'm Deidre. I'm Tim's...

12:46.930 --> 12:48.352
She's my shooting star.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.591
Aww.

12:53.870 --> 12:56.361
Can I get you a drink?
What would you like?

12:56.440 --> 12:58.635
Answers _
to a few questions.

12:58.710 --> 13:02.032
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth so help me God.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.109
We met
at the bowling alley.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.114
(ALL LAUGHING) It only
took her three frames

13:07.180 --> 13:10.115
to get her Shoe stuck
in the ball return.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.987
I had to press
the little "help" button,

13:12.050 --> 13:14.359
and he came
and got my shoe back.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.184
But I'll be damned
if he didn't steal
my heart in the process.

13:18.260 --> 13:20.797
I teach second grade
in Bedford.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.727
Guess I love
being around kids 'cause
I come from a big family.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.361
Seeing as he didn't know much
about his, I encouraged him.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.160
I got my birth certificate,
found out my mom had died.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.902
She moved to California
after she had me,

13:33.980 --> 13:36.869
got married,
had another kid.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.339
Deidre held my hand,
I pick up the phone...

13:39.410 --> 13:40.638
Next thing,
I had a sister.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.881
I always thought
I was an only child.

13:42.950 --> 13:45.248
When Mom passed, I didn't
have anyone but Marcus.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.413
And when we heard
that Helen had a brother,

13:47.490 --> 13:48.718
I didn't know
what to think.

13:48.790 --> 13:50.257
We flew across the country
to meet him.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.888
And I gave him a big hug.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.258
Probably talk once a day
on the phone now.

13:54.330 --> 13:55.649
Uh, when Tim called
to tell me

13:55.730 --> 13:57.721
who his father was
and what had happened...

13:57.800 --> 14:00.234
We were happy for him.
How could you not be?

14:00.300 --> 14:02.165
But I'm just glad
I have a brother.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.832
That's what matters to me.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.803
Mr. Reddington. That recess
was anything but brief.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.245
Any further delays?

14:11.310 --> 14:13.346
Or might we finally
get this Show on the road?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.911
I'm finished serving
the public good
for the moment, Your Honor.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.244
So, yes, the Government
may once again

14:18.320 --> 14:21.084
go about its business
of trying to execute me.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.458
Wonderful. Mr. Sima?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.521
Sir, please state your name
for the record.

14:25.590 --> 14:29.549
Officer Michael Baldwin.
Shield 21561.

14:29.630 --> 14:32.098
I'm a patrol officer
with the 27th Precinct.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.388
On the day in question,
the 16th of this month,

14:34.470 --> 14:36.461
were you in fact on patrol

14:36.540 --> 14:38.337
in the 27th Precinct?
Yes.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.571
Did you make any arrests
that afternoon?

14:40.640 --> 14:44.041
One. _I arrested that man
there, in the navy-blue swt.

14:44.110 --> 14:46.749
May the record reflect
the witness has
identified the defendant.

14:46.810 --> 14:49.278
Uh, o-objection.
Grounds?

14:49.350 --> 14:51.989
That's not entirely correct,
Your Honor.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.655
The suit is actually
a prunelle weave...

14:54.720 --> 14:57.427
Blue with a subtle
overlay of red.

14:57.490 --> 15:00.095
So in the right light,
it goes quite plum.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.299
Denied.
So reflected.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.759
SIMA: Officer Baldwin,

15:03.830 --> 15:05.593
how did you come to
arrest the defendant?

15:05.670 --> 15:08.969
I received
a radio run of a man
with a gun on West 4th Street

15:09.040 --> 15:11.167
near the vicinity
of the Red Brau Tavern.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.105
Dispatch described
the individual

15:13.180 --> 15:17.276
as a white male, 505,
in a tan suit and hat.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.568
I approached the location
on foot where I observed

15:19.650 --> 15:21.470
the defendant standing
at a pretzel cart

15:21.550 --> 15:22.983
in _a conversation
With the vendor.

15:23.050 --> 15:24.938
What drew your attention
to the defendant?

15:25.020 --> 15:28.183
It was
the only suit in the area
wearing a fedora-style hat.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.979
I see. And did you arrest
the defendant at that point?

15:31.060 --> 15:33.494
No, sir.
I approached Mr. Reddington

15:33.560 --> 15:35.289
in an effort to
assess the situation.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.126
I requested ID,
and he gave me a fake
driver's license and name.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.497
SIMA:
Who did he say he was?

15:40.570 --> 15:43.630
A shower curtain salesman
named George Murphy.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.802
SIMA: How did he seem?

15:44.870 --> 15:47.031
BALDWIN: Nervous.
His eyes were darting.

15:47.110 --> 15:50.341
I got the feeling that he was
possibly being evasive.

15:50.410 --> 15:53.174
At one point, he turned and
looked towards the tavern,

15:53.250 --> 15:55.047
which I interpreted
to be a furtive gesture...

15:55.120 --> 15:56.610
Furtive?
Is that what it was?

15:56.680 --> 15:58.216
You'll get your turn,
Mr. Reddington.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.009
I asked him to turn around,
and he refused...

16:01.090 --> 16:03.479
Made a joke about it
not being his good side.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.324
That's when I noticed
a bulge in his jacket,
at his waistline.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.028
Objection.
Y-Your Honor.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.318
No. A bulge
at my waistline?

16:10.400 --> 16:11.719
I'd prefer that the witness

16:11.800 --> 16:13.358
leave my bulges
out of this entirely.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.964
You'll... Mr. Reddington...
That's more than en...

16:15.040 --> 16:16.359
I want that struck
from the record.
It's embarrassmg.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.329
Sit down, or I will have
someone sit you down!

16:19.410 --> 16:21.037
Officer,
please continue.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.249
I had the defendant
put his hands on the cart,

16:23.310 --> 16:25.744
and I conducted a pat-down
of his person.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.517
That's when I recovered
a Browning
semi-automatic pistol

16:28.580 --> 16:30.684
from a holster
in the small of his back.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.615
Your Honor, permission
to approach the witness.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.055
Granted.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.417
Do you recognize
this weapon?

16:35.490 --> 16:36.980
That's the one
I recovered.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.528
As you can see, the serial
number's been scratched off.

16:39.590 --> 16:40.852
Your Honor,
the Government moves

16:40.930 --> 16:43.819
to enter _Exhibit 1
into eVIdence.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.390
Thank you, Officer.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.664
That's all for now.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.831
Your witness.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.739
Hey. Guys.
Peterson's story checks out.

17:02.820 --> 17:06.039
He was given up
by his birth mother,
raised in foster care,

17:06.120 --> 17:08.384
and has an alibi for
the night Van Ness died.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.758
Cameras at the
bowling alley show...

17:10.830 --> 17:12.525
Show him working
that night.

17:12.590 --> 17:15.889
So this guy really is the
luckiest half-wit in history.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.598
Or the biggest mark.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.228
COOPER: What did you learn
about the company he keeps?

17:19.300 --> 17:22.394
SAMAR: Helen Litke,
Marcus Duncan, Deidre Mori...

17:22.470 --> 17:24.438
His sister, brother-in-law,
and girlfriend.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.877
We're still waiting on
background information
for Litke and Duncan, but...

17:27.940 --> 17:31.569
The girlfriend told you
she was a second-grade
teacher in Bedford?

17:31.650 --> 17:33.777
The Virginia school system
has no record of her.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.875
Driver's license and
SOCIal Security number

17:35.950 --> 17:38.441
registered to Deidre Mori
are less than 12 months old.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.351
She said she met Peterson
a year ago.

17:40.420 --> 17:43.480
Keen, Ressler, time to have
a little chat with Miss Mori.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.028
Or whoever She really is.

17:46.090 --> 17:48.092
That radio run...

17:48.160 --> 17:50.560
According to
your arrest report,

17:50.630 --> 17:52.860
it was based _
on an anonymous tip.

17:52.930 --> 17:56.491
That's correct.
So someone called 911

17:56.570 --> 17:59.835
and said that a white man
in his 505

17:59.910 --> 18:01.878
wearing a suit and a hat

18:01.940 --> 18:04.602
was in the vicinity
of the Red Brau Tavern

18:04.680 --> 18:06.773
and that man had a gun.
Yes.

18:06.850 --> 18:09.614
And this tip came from someone
you never spoke to,

18:09.680 --> 18:12.740
someone who also refused
to give his or her name

18:12.820 --> 18:14.708
to the police operator.
Yes.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.679
Completely anonymous,
not a trusted source

18:17.760 --> 18:20.854
known to have been
reliable in the past.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.797
That's true,
but I didn't arrest you
based only on the tip.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.667
I conducted my own
investigation.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.869
What investigation
was that?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.362
I asked for identification.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.203
Which I provided
immediately.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.828
A false ID.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.037
(CHUCKLES) No, you didn't
know that at the time.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.668
That license was created

18:36.740 --> 18:40.039
by the preeminent
document forger in the world.

18:40.110 --> 18:42.840
Not in this country.
On the planet.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.809
There's not a chance you could
have known it was a fake.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.858
You looked nervous.
Furtive.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.821
Officer Baldwin,
I've been evading the police

18:50.890 --> 18:53.859
and law enforcement
for almost 30 years.

18:53.930 --> 18:56.558
I'm the most wanted man
in the world.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.359
At the time
of our encounter,

18:58.430 --> 19:02.230
I was armed with a Browning
9—millimeter semi-automatic

19:02.300 --> 19:05.201
with a round in the chamber
and the hammer cocked.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.409
Do you really expect
this court to believe

19:07.480 --> 19:10.745
_ that a marshmallow_
dingIsed as a patrol officer,

19:10.810 --> 19:13.415
a comic figure
in an ill-fitting uniform,

19:13.480 --> 19:15.038
could possibly
make me nervous?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.644
Objection!
Sustained.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.019
You think this is funny?
You're a real smart guy, huh?

19:20.090 --> 19:21.819
Well, we'll see
how smart you are!

19:21.890 --> 19:23.152
(LAUGHS) There he is.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.719
There's the real
Officer Baldwin.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.190
You didn't search me
for looking nervous.

19:29.260 --> 19:32.093
The truth is
I was disrespectful.
No.

19:32.170 --> 19:35.594
I was disrespectful,
you got angry,

19:35.670 --> 19:38.161

doesn't mean anything.

Excuse me?
Of the anonymous call.

23:59.770 --> 24:01.761
We haven't offered
the tape into evidence.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.104
Exactly.
How do I know it even exists?

24:04.170 --> 24:07.435
How do I know you're not
fabricating the entire call

24:07.510 --> 24:09.603
as a way
to justify the search?

24:09.680 --> 24:13.047
Should I even ask if you have
any foundation for that?

24:13.110 --> 24:15.010
Oh, come on.
The government pretended

24:15.080 --> 24:17.139
my immunity agreement
didn't exist.

24:17.220 --> 24:20.280
How do I know you're not
pretending the tape does?

24:20.350 --> 24:23.387
Under the circumstances,
that's a fair question,
Mr. Sima.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.883
This hearing
is about Officer Baldwin

24:26.960 --> 24:28.723
and whether he had
a reasonable suspICIon

24:28.800 --> 24:30.290
that this defendant
was carrying a weapon.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.624
Yes, and he relied
on the information

24:32.700 --> 24:34.565
that was relayed
in that call.

24:34.640 --> 24:39.304
No. He relied
on the information
relayed by his dispatcher.

24:42.110 --> 24:44.408
I was targeted.
I want to know Why.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.345
The why is irrelevant.
What you want to know is who.

24:46.410 --> 24:48.014
You want to hear
the voice on that tape.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.140
I have a Sixth Amendment right
to confront my accusers.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.518
Something tells me you're
interested in more than
just confrontation.

24:53.590 --> 24:55.581
Your Honor, given this
defendant's history...

24:55.660 --> 24:57.480
What history?
I haven't made any threats.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.187
And in case you've forgotten,
I'm in federal custody.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.852
Oh, right, and I'm sure
if you recognized the voice

25:00.930 --> 25:02.852
you're not gonna put a bullet
in that person's head!

25:02.930 --> 25:06.058
JUDGE WILKINS: Enough! Now,
I agree, as a matter of law,

25:06.130 --> 25:07.893
What matters
is what the officer believed

25:07.970 --> 25:10.530
at the time he conducted
the pat-down, period.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.737
That said, given
the government's penchant

25:12.810 --> 25:15.278
for dishonesty where
this defendant is concerned,

25:15.340 --> 25:17.706
I think it's more
than reasonable to wonder

25:17.780 --> 25:19.509
if the police
are playing fair.

just yet.

to produce the tape,

Objection.
Overruled.

25:30.090 --> 25:32.081
I'm not giving you that tape,
Mr. Reddington.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.196
But I will confirm
that it exists

25:34.260 --> 25:35.852

What they claim.

against each other.

that's a good idea.

to keep it that way.

He wouldn't listen.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.822
Not about Van Ness

to bleed Tim dry, is he?

What did he have,
Your Honor?

33:55.300 --> 33:57.723
What did who have?
Officer Baldwin.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.066
A tip from a source who
refused to give their name.

34:02.140 --> 34:06.258
No explanation
as to how their information
was achIred,

34:06.340 --> 34:09.309
no prior history
of reliability,

34:09.380 --> 34:13.942
no compelling
reason to believe_
the tip was even credible.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.384
I couldn't possibly
have been the only one.

34:24.460 --> 34:26.257
And how did the caller know

34:26.330 --> 34:27.979
I was carrying
a concealed weapon?

34:28.060 --> 34:30.722
It was concealed,

34:30.800 --> 34:33.792
In What stretch
of the imagination

34:33.870 --> 34:38.261
could this kind of tip
justify this search?

34:38.340 --> 34:41.639
Officer Baldwin obviously
knew that when he got there,

34:41.710 --> 34:44.804
which is why he didn't just
throw me up against a wall.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.269
He knew that what he had

34:47.350 --> 34:51.684
didn't amount to reasonable
suspICIon under the law.

34:51.750 --> 34:54.150
So what did he do?
He investigated.

34:54.220 --> 34:56.313
Please excuse
my drip of sarcasm,

34:56.390 --> 34:59.279
but Officer Baldwin asked
for some identification,

34:59.360 --> 35:04.662
and I gave him a false ID
so magnificent,

35:04.730 --> 35:07.665

my name was George Murphy.

nervously.

I made fun of the man.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.702
the respect he somehow
believe he deserved.

I might regret.

35:20.710 --> 35:23.270
It's one of my biggest
issues in therapy,

35:23.350 --> 35:26.683
along with some residual
anxiety from childhood

and a sexual fascination I'd
prefer to discuss in chambers.

35:30.190 --> 35:34.297
But the point is the tip
gave him next to nothing,

35:34.360 --> 35:37.955
_and his own observations
didn't change things one iota.

and even he knows it,

since I'm pretty sure

Let me be clear.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.671
Reasonable suspicion
can be based

38:07.750 --> 38:09.877

What the Supreme Court calls
"an indicia of reliability."

the courts look

38:17.090 --> 38:19.524

But there's more.

38:35.540 --> 38:38.475
_ The officer made
his own observations.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.371
In his view,
the defendant seemed nervous.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.647
Whatever looks
the defendant gave,
he interpreted as furtive.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.883

to turn around.

38:47.950 --> 38:51.317
Is that enough? It probably
wouldn't have been for me.

38:51.390 --> 38:53.153

38:53.230 --> 38:55.255
Whether I would have patted
Mr. Reddington down.

38:55.330 --> 38:58.219
The issue is,
was the decision to do so

39:01.600 --> 39:04.364
I find that it wasn't.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.363
They'll throw out
your immunity.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.765
I was set up.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.407
What are you
talking about?

41:22.810 --> 41:25.802
There's a recording
of the person
who tipped off the cops.

41:27.850 --> 41:29.442
Have you heard it?

41:31.050 --> 41:32.415
What goes on in court...

41:32.490 --> 41:35.288
Yeah, there are rules,
people play their parts.

41:36.590 --> 41:39.252
Your enemies are known.
It's a fair fight.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.990
And despite losing today,
it's only just begun.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.127
Have you heard
the recording?

41:49.470 --> 41:50.789
No.

41:50.870 --> 41:54.408
* You barely talked,
and I didn't mind *

41:54.470 --> 41:57.678
(INHALES DEEPLY)
But I intend to.

41:57.740 --> 42:00.345
And when I do,
I'll know who betrayed me.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.687
And at that moment,
no matter Where I am...

42:04.750 --> 42:07.685
On the street,
in solitary confinement,

42:07.750 --> 42:10.412
or on the receiving end
of a firing squad...

42:10.490 --> 42:12.981
At that moment,
Whoever set me up...

42:14.700 --> 42:16.258
His fate will be sealed.

42:16.330 --> 42:18.594
(VOCALIZING)
