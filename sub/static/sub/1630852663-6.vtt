WEBVTT

01:44.416 --> 01:47.291
- I only wish we could have
gotten here sooner.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.916
Is there anything else
we can do?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.208
Not at this stage.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.833
You have a list of
the passengers in the hospital.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.916
And another of the dead.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.375
- Five victims is tragic,
of course.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.458
But no women and no children,
thank God.

01:59.541 --> 02:01.041
It might have been much worse.

02:02.875 --> 02:04.500
I want to give you something

02:04.583 --> 02:06.291
for all that you've done.

02:08.166 --> 02:09.333
For the Red Cross.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.541
Thank you, Mr. Russell.

02:14.625 --> 02:16.291
- We're very grateful,
Miss Barton.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.125
- Will you be at
the next meeting, Mrs. Russell?

02:18.208 --> 02:19.875
I'll quite understand
if you'd rather not.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.083
She'll be there.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.166
What should we do now?

02:27.250 --> 02:28.666
- The wounded are
in Pennsylvania Hospital.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.500
You could go there.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.416
The police need to speak
with you.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.500
But they can do that
back in New York.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.500
Mr. Russell? Mrs. Russell?

02:36.583 --> 02:38.833
He's from "The Daily Graphic."

02:38.916 --> 02:40.208
They came for pictures
of the train.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.125
- But now they've seen you.
- Better let him do it.

02:42.208 --> 02:44.791
Or they might say
we were hiding.

02:44.875 --> 02:45.958
Bertha?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.375
- Five dead doesn't seem
very many.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.583
- Oh, Agnes.
Think of their families.

03:00.666 --> 03:03.166
- Of course, it was negligence
on Mr. Russell's part.

03:03.250 --> 03:06.500
- Is that fair?
- He's the captain, isn't he?

03:06.583 --> 03:08.916
Or doesn't an officer take
responsibility in that class?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.666
- Of course
he'll take responsibility,

03:10.750 --> 03:12.541
but it doesn't mean
it's his fault.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.375
I do not follow you.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.708
- When is the committee meeting
at Aurora's?

03:16.791 --> 03:17.875
Is it this week?

03:17.958 --> 03:21.291
- Thursday, but I'm not sure
it will happen now.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.583
Why not?

03:22.666 --> 03:24.208
- Someone she's expecting
may not be able

03:24.291 --> 03:26.416
to get there after all.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.250
- Why are you being
so elliptical?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.375
Who may not come
to the meeting?

03:31.958 --> 03:33.833
- Mrs. Russell.
- Oh.

03:33.916 --> 03:35.500
Heavens, Agnes.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.625
Can we let Marian
off the witness stand

03:37.708 --> 03:39.416
for ten minutes at least?

03:41.041 --> 03:43.791
I had a letter from
Cousin Margaret this morning.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.541
She says the opera war
is really heating up.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.166
- Why does there have
to be a war?

03:48.250 --> 03:49.833
Why can't the Academy create
more boxes

03:49.916 --> 03:51.250
for the new people to rent?

03:51.333 --> 03:54.250
- Because the Academy of Music
is one of the last bastions

03:54.333 --> 03:56.250
of decency and standards
in this city.

03:56.333 --> 03:59.541
We will not patronize
any jumped-up opera house,

03:59.625 --> 04:01.791
however loud and gaudy
it may be.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.458
- Metal fatigue
and a broken axle?

04:08.541 --> 04:09.583
That's impossible.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.833
- Not if they weren't new
when they were installed.

04:12.916 --> 04:14.833
- At some point in the chain,
a man did this,

04:14.916 --> 04:15.958
and I want to know who.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.208
We're dealing with it.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.791
- The public will think
we've cut corners,

04:18.875 --> 04:21.208
and the result
is five innocent deaths.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.333
They'll know we have
a killer on our payroll.

04:23.416 --> 04:25.541
And we need to make it clear
it isn't me.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.250
- The police are doing
their best.

04:28.916 --> 04:30.166
Go down to Pinkerton.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.625
I want a couple of his men
on the case.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.041
Give them all the help
they need.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.666
Keep me up to date
with their inquiries.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.666
- Of course.
You should go home.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.833
- I thought you'd like to see
the latest coverage.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.833
- We're not too badly damaged
on the market,

04:46.916 --> 04:47.875
I'm glad to say.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.625
- Well, Miss Barton gave
a good quote.

04:49.708 --> 04:51.250
She called you
"grief-stricken."

04:51.333 --> 04:52.916
- I am grief-stricken.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.416
You're also very rich.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.458
And likely to remain so.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.541
- Away on your errands,
Miss Scott?

05:03.625 --> 05:05.458
- Miss Brook's
Red Cross meeting is today.

05:05.541 --> 05:07.041
I've said I'd go with her.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.416
I'm not sure
when we'll be back.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.041
Oh, don't worry.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.541
- Do you have any errands
you'd like me to run?

05:11.625 --> 05:13.750
- No,
I'm going shopping tomorrow.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.541
What about you, Miss Armstrong?

05:15.625 --> 05:17.291
Meaning what?

05:17.375 --> 05:18.916
Meaning nothing.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.500
Miss Scott is offering
to do us a good turn.

05:21.583 --> 05:25.166
- Why? Is she suggesting
we can't do our work?

05:25.250 --> 05:26.541
I'll be off, Mrs. Bauer,

05:26.625 --> 05:27.833
or I'll keep
Miss Brook waiting.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.625
What is the matter with you?

05:35.708 --> 05:37.250
- She's always trying
to set me up

05:37.333 --> 05:38.583
as some poor, sad creature

05:38.666 --> 05:40.791
who's too old for the work
she's employed to do.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.750
You watch. You'll see it.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
You're very quiet.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.083
- I'm just thinking
about the poor men

05:50.166 --> 05:51.250
in the train crash.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.875
Oh, I feel for their wives.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.958
Making dinner, expecting
their husbands to be home

05:55.041 --> 05:57.208
at any moment.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.708
- Suppose the truth is, you
never know what's coming next.

05:59.791 --> 06:00.875
- So we should try
to get the most

06:00.958 --> 06:02.375
out of what's happening now.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.375
- Sometimes
it's hard to be quite sure

06:06.458 --> 06:08.875
of what is happening now.

06:08.958 --> 06:10.583
If you mean Mr. Raikes...

06:11.916 --> 06:13.041
I like him.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.041
He's a fine lawyer.
He's been kind to me.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.666
Of course, he's handsome.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.000
I feel a "but" coming on.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.458
- The things he said
in Dansville.

06:20.541 --> 06:22.833
- While you listened
in the shadows.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.458
- He didn't seem to have
much of a plan.

06:24.541 --> 06:25.750
That's all.

06:27.375 --> 06:29.125
By the way,
after this meeting is over,

06:29.208 --> 06:30.291
would you like me
to see you home?

06:30.375 --> 06:31.791
Why? Where are you going?

06:31.875 --> 06:33.625
- Lower Manhattan
to the "Globe" office.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.750
I'm meeting Mr. Fortune.

06:35.833 --> 06:37.875
- Your writing career
is so exciting.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.625
- Miss Brook,
how nice to see you.

06:41.708 --> 06:44.125
- You remember Miss Scott.
- Of course.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.250
I read your article
in the "Globe," Miss Scott.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.458
You were very flattering.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.000
- I only hope
I did you justice.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.083
- Either way,
you are welcome at my meeting.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.541
- Mrs. Fane.
- Miss Barton.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.666
- Marian.
- Aurora.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.083
- Miss Scott.
- Mrs. Fane.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.500
Excuse me.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.000
I brought my dollar, Miss Ada.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.833
Oh. How trying it is for you.

07:13.916 --> 07:16.375
No. I must pay my debt.

07:16.458 --> 07:18.291
- Well, if it becomes
troublesome,

07:18.375 --> 07:19.708
just let me know.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.333
- I've asked Mrs. Russell
to join us.

07:26.416 --> 07:28.916
- Why? She is the wife
of a murderer

07:29.000 --> 07:30.458
who has even more blood
on his hands now

07:30.541 --> 07:32.291
then when he killed my husband.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.125
- Mrs. Morris,
you have suffered a great deal,

07:35.208 --> 07:36.958
and I am sorry for it.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.500
But I hope you can recognize
that this meeting

07:39.583 --> 07:42.416
is not the place to address
your society squabble.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.166
- This isn't
a society squabble,

07:44.250 --> 07:47.750
since Mrs. Russell
is not in society.

07:48.833 --> 07:51.333
- What an interesting moment
for me to arrive.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.333
Ladies, ladies.

07:54.416 --> 07:57.541
If Mrs. Russell will be seated,
we will have a show of hands.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.708
All in favor of inviting
Mrs. Russell on the board?

08:10.083 --> 08:12.708
- I would like to remind you
that no one in this city

08:12.791 --> 08:15.375
has done more real good
for my cause.

08:26.333 --> 08:29.500
- So money
is the deciding factor here?

08:29.583 --> 08:31.583
Yet again.

08:31.666 --> 08:35.458
What a sad and vulgar world
we live in.

08:35.541 --> 08:38.916
- We're not arranging
a debutant ball, Mrs. Morris.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.208
We're raising money to bring
help to people in dire need

08:42.291 --> 08:43.375
all over this country.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.708
- And because I cannot give
as much as Mrs. Russell,

08:45.791 --> 08:48.583
I am to be jettisoned
while she is enthroned?

08:48.666 --> 08:49.875
- How thrilling
you make it sound.

08:49.958 --> 08:51.708
Nobody is being jettisoned.

08:51.791 --> 08:53.208
- Good luck
with your new member

08:53.291 --> 08:55.208
and your new set of values.

08:55.291 --> 08:58.291
I do not share your admiration
for either.

09:07.458 --> 09:09.500
- Shall we all collect
a cup of coffee

09:09.583 --> 09:10.958
before we regroup?

09:11.041 --> 09:12.500
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.333
Wonderful idea.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.791
- Miss Scott,
I am pleased to see you here.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.000
- Thank you for that, Mrs. Fane.
- It's a pleasure.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.250
- Let us hope your article
will have interested others

09:26.333 --> 09:27.416
in our cause.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.166
Which reminds me, Miss Brook.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.291
Have you made any progress
with Mrs. Chamberlain?

09:31.375 --> 09:32.875
- I'm calling on her
next Thursday.

09:32.958 --> 09:34.583
Oh, my dear. Are you sure?

09:34.666 --> 09:36.458
I was rather hoping
that would be forgotten

09:36.541 --> 09:38.416
after Mrs. Russell's
generous gift.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.250
- No opportunity to raise funds
may be forgotten.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.875
And surely no one decent could
doubt Miss Brook's motives.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.208
Maybe not.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.041
But there are plenty of people
in New York

09:47.125 --> 09:48.708
who are not decent at all.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.208
- Mrs. Russell is winning
the battle.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.208
- The battle, maybe,
but not the war.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.791
Not yet.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.000
Now we need a cab.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.958
I'll drop you off
at the "Globe" offices.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.291
Where to?

10:06.375 --> 10:07.833
- Cedar Street
in lower Manhattan, please.

10:07.916 --> 10:09.458
And then to 61st Street.

10:09.541 --> 10:12.208
I'll drive you. Not her.

10:12.291 --> 10:14.333
- Aren't you in business
to make money, sir?

10:14.416 --> 10:16.583
- Step back.
- I will not step back--

10:16.666 --> 10:18.250
Hyah!

10:20.041 --> 10:21.083
How rude.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.458
- But it's not unusual.
What was the point of that?

10:23.541 --> 10:24.958
- Aren't some fights
worth having?

10:25.041 --> 10:27.041
- Not if it's going to make me
late for my meeting.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.583
I don't understand.

10:28.666 --> 10:30.083
- You've just discovered
injustice.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.416
I've lived with it
my whole life.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.416
If I spent every day
fighting with bigots,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.208
I'd never get anything done.

10:35.291 --> 10:37.041
This time, let me hail the cab.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.083
If it stops,
that means he'll take me.

10:41.791 --> 10:43.791
All right.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.208
Whoa, there.

10:48.291 --> 10:49.750
Whoa.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.500
- I want to apologize
for Mrs. Morris.

10:52.583 --> 10:53.750
She forgot herself.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.208
- She's angry,
and she blames George.

10:55.291 --> 10:56.666
So naturally, she hates me.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.541
You're very philosophical.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.833
- I've had worse to deal with.
- Of course you have.

11:00.916 --> 11:03.041
I was so sorry to read
about the accident.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.666
Isn't it typical?

11:04.750 --> 11:06.875
Just as we seem
to be getting somewhere.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.375
No one will blame you.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.541
And to prove my point,
there was another matter

11:10.625 --> 11:12.791
I want to discuss with you.

11:12.875 --> 11:15.250
Mr. McAllister
has written to me.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.916
He said
you have made him curious

11:17.000 --> 11:19.416
to see your
"palace on the Avenue."

11:19.500 --> 11:21.375
- Ward McAllister wants me
to entertain him

11:21.458 --> 11:23.375
- in my own home?
- He does.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.250
- I wonder
if he's told Mrs. Astor.

11:25.333 --> 11:26.750
I think he will.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.666
- But whom could I invite
with him?

11:28.750 --> 11:30.250
I can't include anyone
from his own set.

11:30.333 --> 11:31.583
I don't know them.

11:31.666 --> 11:33.166
- Assemble the same group
that came here.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.791
He enjoyed himself then.
Why shouldn't he again?

11:35.875 --> 11:37.541
But service must be English.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.708
He uses it
to frighten newcomers.

11:39.791 --> 11:41.416
Well, it's worked with me.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.833
You'll manage.

11:42.916 --> 11:44.708
But be sure to make it
a success.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.791
He won't give you
a second chance.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.916
- You've essentially
done something

11:54.000 --> 11:55.958
Parker never thought possible.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.125
What is that?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.708
Increased our subscriptions.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.250
Why don't you look happy?

12:05.333 --> 12:08.250
- Well, probably
because I'm in shock.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.833
But how do you know
that my article

12:09.916 --> 12:10.916
is responsible for this?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.833
- My agents
on the Eastern Seaboard

12:12.916 --> 12:15.291
report strong sales
and quite a bit of chatter

12:15.375 --> 12:16.291
about your piece.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.041
It's not often
the colored journalists

12:18.125 --> 12:20.750
have access to the likes
of Clara Barton.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.083
- I have a friend
who made the introduction

12:22.166 --> 12:24.250
to Miss Barton, and she was
very willing to be interviewed.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.166
Well...

12:26.250 --> 12:27.708
keep up the good work.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.291
I'll do my best.

12:32.916 --> 12:36.166
- Does Monsieur McAllister have
to follow the English fashion?

12:36.250 --> 12:38.000
Might he not welcome a change?

12:38.083 --> 12:39.833
Apparently not.

12:39.916 --> 12:41.500
You have a menu in mind?

12:41.583 --> 12:43.666
- Fish and chips,
suet pudding?

12:43.750 --> 12:45.958
Or what about
boiled beef and carrots?

12:46.041 --> 12:47.583
- The principal dish
will be French.

12:47.666 --> 12:48.541
I think he'll forgive that.

12:48.625 --> 12:49.625
But we will give
an English flavor

12:49.708 --> 12:51.541
to some of the other courses
just for fun.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.541
- You know how to do it.
- As you wish, madam.

12:53.625 --> 12:56.833
- However, the service must be
entirely in the English style.

12:58.791 --> 13:00.791
- I will make
a list of suggestions.

13:00.875 --> 13:01.791
Thank you.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.958
But, Church,
are you sure you can bring off

13:04.041 --> 13:06.333
a luncheon laid and served
in the English manner?

13:06.416 --> 13:07.625
Why shouldn't we?

13:10.208 --> 13:11.625
It is a good deal to take on.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.333
Thank you all very much.

13:18.958 --> 13:21.708
- May I make a suggestion,
ma'am?

13:21.791 --> 13:22.958
Please do.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.916
- Are you aware that
Mrs. Van Rhijn's butler

13:25.000 --> 13:26.375
across the road is English?

13:26.458 --> 13:29.166
And I believe Mrs. Van Rhijn
follows English traditions.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.833
Wouldn't she just?

13:30.916 --> 13:31.916
But what are you suggesting?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.791
Rather than put Church
to the test,

13:33.875 --> 13:37.333
why not let Mr. Bannister solve
any problems before they arise?

13:37.416 --> 13:39.541
Of course, we'd have
to get Mr. Church to agree.

13:39.625 --> 13:40.958
I'll leave that to you.

13:41.041 --> 13:43.333
But don't give him a choice.

14:15.666 --> 14:17.333
Peggy.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.541
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

14:19.625 --> 14:21.458
Do I need an invitation?

14:21.541 --> 14:23.375
- No, but they could have
prepared something

14:23.458 --> 14:24.500
in the kitchen.

14:24.583 --> 14:25.750
And I'd have put off
my piano student

14:25.833 --> 14:27.000
who'll be here in a moment.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.791
No need. I can't stay long.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.041
- Long enough for me
to congratulate you in person

14:31.125 --> 14:33.500
on your story?

14:33.583 --> 14:35.125
Have you shown it to Father?

14:37.041 --> 14:38.083
Yes.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.625
But he didn't read it.

14:41.708 --> 14:42.958
He read it.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.666
But he doesn't wish
to encourage you

14:45.750 --> 14:47.333
to pursue a career
that he thinks

14:47.416 --> 14:48.791
is bound to fail.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.500
He's wrong.

14:50.583 --> 14:53.125
I've just come
from Mr. Fortune's office.

14:53.208 --> 14:56.416
He said my article has
increased their circulation.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.083
- You should tell
your father that.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.291
Why?

15:00.375 --> 15:02.166
When he doesn't approve
of anything I do?

15:02.250 --> 15:04.083
We have to get through it.

15:04.166 --> 15:08.500
We're a family,
and we must get through it.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.375
- Please don't come
by 61st Street again

15:10.458 --> 15:12.125
and speak with Miss Brook
about family matters.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.958
Don't cut us out, Peggy.

15:14.041 --> 15:17.583
- I don't wanna cut you out,
Mama.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.375
I've never wanted that.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.500
Just your father.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.833
- Can we meet without him,
then?

15:30.416 --> 15:31.583
We'll see.

15:47.166 --> 15:49.291
- How did you get on?
- Very well.

15:49.375 --> 15:50.500
I'm now a member of the board

15:50.583 --> 15:53.083
with a ringing endorsement
from Miss Barton herself.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.541
Mrs. Morris made no trouble?

15:54.625 --> 15:55.875
I wouldn't quite say that.

15:55.958 --> 15:58.000
But Mrs. Fane, Miss Barton,
and Miss Brook

15:58.083 --> 16:00.041
- all ganged up against her.
- Ah, Miss Brook.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.208
That's nice.

16:02.791 --> 16:04.333
They know
what caused the crash.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.125
One of the axles broke.

16:07.208 --> 16:08.458
How could that be?

16:08.541 --> 16:09.875
It was substandard.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.791
All of the axles on the engine
were substandard.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.583
Someone in my organization

16:14.666 --> 16:16.541
used old and damage axles
on the engine,

16:16.625 --> 16:18.333
stealing my money as he did so

16:18.416 --> 16:20.333
and killing five men
in the process.

16:20.416 --> 16:22.291
- We must try and control
the damage.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.833
The company's taken
a bit of a dent,

16:23.916 --> 16:25.166
but we seem
to be climbing back.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.500
- No, I meant the damage to us.
You and me.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.125
Can you manage the papers?

16:30.583 --> 16:32.000
Within limits.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.416
Unless it goes to trial.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.166
- Because I heard today
that Mr. McAllister

16:35.250 --> 16:36.375
wants to come here
for luncheon.

16:36.458 --> 16:37.750
What do you think of that?

16:37.833 --> 16:39.875
Well, if you're asking,

16:39.958 --> 16:41.916
I think the fact
that five men are dead

16:42.041 --> 16:44.708
and a member of my staff
has blood on his hands

16:44.791 --> 16:46.416
is a little more important
than whether or not

16:46.500 --> 16:48.625
the great Ward McAllister
comes here for luncheon.

16:48.708 --> 16:49.791
It matters, George.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.291
I've worked for this,
and it matters to me

16:51.375 --> 16:53.083
- even if it doesn't to you.
- Well, you're right there.

16:53.166 --> 16:54.083
I don't give a rat's ass

16:54.166 --> 16:55.583
where Mr. McAllister
breaks his bread.

16:58.666 --> 16:59.708
I'm sorry.

17:03.791 --> 17:06.541
- I know what I want,
and he can help me to get it.

17:07.958 --> 17:10.083
By the way, he's written
to her, Mr. Baldwin.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.208
- You still open
Gladys's letters?

17:12.291 --> 17:13.500
Always.

17:13.583 --> 17:14.875
Well, give it to her now.

17:14.958 --> 17:16.166
He's accepted the situation,

17:16.250 --> 17:18.041
but he writes
a little too well.

17:18.125 --> 17:19.166
Then I'll give it to her.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.958
- If you go soft on me now,
George,

17:22.041 --> 17:23.583
we could lose everything
we've worked for.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.791
Whom am I going soft about?

17:25.875 --> 17:28.458
The dead in the train wreck,
or your only daughter?

17:29.708 --> 17:32.833
Just please don't be soft.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.875
- No one could accuse you
of that.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.625
<i>But what's he done wrong?</i>

17:42.541 --> 17:43.791
- Your mother thinks
you're too young

17:43.875 --> 17:45.291
for an engagement, that's all.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.416
But it isn't all.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.083
If she said we had
to wait a year or something,

17:48.166 --> 17:49.500
I'd accept it, but she hasn't.

17:49.583 --> 17:52.416
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- Don't pretend.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.416
You're the one
who set out the conditions.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.708
Why do you say that?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.250
- "Your father has asked
for my word

17:58.333 --> 17:59.583
"that we will not meet again.

17:59.666 --> 18:01.250
"Or, if we do, that we should
not attempt to speak

18:01.333 --> 18:02.583
in any private manner."

18:02.666 --> 18:04.375
Your mother thinks it best.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.250
- You're one of the most
successful men in the country.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.000
With real estate and steel
and copper and coal and oil

18:12.083 --> 18:13.583
and railroads
that are the envy of the world,

18:13.666 --> 18:15.125
and you can't stand up
to your wife?

18:21.083 --> 18:22.541
I suppose you bought him off.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.791
And if he took it,
he wasn't worthy of me.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.125
That's what Mother will say.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.000
Don't be too hard on the boy.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.958
I made it tough for him
to refuse.

18:31.041 --> 18:33.125
- I just wish
I knew the reason.

18:33.208 --> 18:35.208
- Because your mother believes
that you have more to come

18:35.291 --> 18:37.041
than marriage to a banker
in Manhattan.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.125
What's wrong with that?

18:39.208 --> 18:40.791
Nothing.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.625
It's not special.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.250
Father, I'm not special.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.791
Why can't she see it?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.291
I'm ordinary.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.416
I'm just an ordinary person
who wants an ordinary life.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.916
No, my darling.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.291
You are not
in the least ordinary.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.208
On that point,
your mother and I are as one.

19:08.958 --> 19:11.375
- You intend to accept
a luncheon invitation

19:11.458 --> 19:13.375
from Mrs. Russell?

19:13.458 --> 19:15.041
- Should I have gone
without telling?

19:15.125 --> 19:17.166
- She could have done that,
you know.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.333
These people.

19:18.416 --> 19:20.541
You shut the door,
they come in the window.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.541
You shut the window,
they come down the chimney.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.208
- They never give up.
- But isn't that a good thing?

19:25.291 --> 19:26.833
- Why is she entertaining
at all?

19:26.916 --> 19:28.333
Shouldn't she be in mourning?

19:28.416 --> 19:31.000
- She wasn't driving the train,
Agnes.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.666
Hmm. So.

19:33.750 --> 19:37.583
She's ensnared Mr. McAllister
and dragged him to her lair?

19:37.666 --> 19:40.250
- I think he's just coming
to luncheon.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.500
- She hopes to trap
the queen bee.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.083
Now she's caught the drone.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.708
But Lina Astor would never
set foot in that house

19:46.791 --> 19:49.083
if they laid a trail of gold
from the sidewalk,

19:49.166 --> 19:50.291
and nor would I.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.166
Will Mr. Raikes be there?

19:54.166 --> 19:55.375
I think so.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.750
I wish I could see
what he's done wrong.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.875
- I've told you.
He's an adventurer.

20:00.958 --> 20:02.541
I suppose he's worming his way

20:02.625 --> 20:04.500
into every ballroom
in the city?

20:04.583 --> 20:05.958
It's true people invite him,

20:06.041 --> 20:08.583
but that's because
he's pleasant and popular.

20:08.666 --> 20:12.083
- Everyone likes him.
- Everyone except me.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.291
Be warned, my dear.

20:13.375 --> 20:16.458
He won't need you much longer
if he keeps this up.

20:18.375 --> 20:21.000
Any minute now, he'll see
his chance and move on

20:21.083 --> 20:22.916
to more glittering prizes.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.458
Agnes.

20:24.541 --> 20:26.791
What a horrid thing to say.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.625
- You don't know him,
Aunt Agnes.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.750
I know his type.

20:31.833 --> 20:33.666
And I am never wrong.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.333
You're wrong this time.

20:40.041 --> 20:43.625
- Marian didn't mean that.
- Yes, she did.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.083
You mark my words.
It will come back to haunt her.

20:53.083 --> 20:54.625
I'll go.

20:54.708 --> 20:57.166
- What did Miss Ada want
when you went to her yesterday?

20:57.250 --> 20:58.541
Nothing much.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.333
- I don't suppose it
was changing the menus

21:00.416 --> 21:03.000
without asking Mrs. Van Rhijn?

21:04.750 --> 21:06.500
That's the drawing room, John.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.000
- It was one
of the Russell footmen.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.166
- I'll take it up.
I should get back to work.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.458
It's for Mr. Bannister.

21:13.541 --> 21:16.333
Oh, well. What a surprise.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.375
- Hmm.
Mr. Church wants my advice.

21:25.458 --> 21:29.666
Would I look in
whenever it might suit me?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.333
And will you go?

21:31.416 --> 21:33.833
- Oh, I don't think
my curiosity

21:33.916 --> 21:36.541
can be satisfied
in any other way.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.166
Mr. Bannister.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.291
Aren't you worried
by Mis Scott's scribblings?

21:43.375 --> 21:44.625
Why? Should I be?

21:44.708 --> 21:46.708
- Won't she cause talk
about Mrs. Van Rhijn?

21:46.791 --> 21:48.416
Not that she'd mean to,
of course.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.833
But I do worry.

21:49.916 --> 21:52.083
- Of course you do,
Miss Armstrong.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.041
- I had a message
from Mrs. Fish this morning.

22:00.125 --> 22:01.041
Hmm?

22:01.125 --> 22:02.166
She's having a tea party,

22:02.250 --> 22:04.333
and she's invited
me and Gladys.

22:04.416 --> 22:05.541
How nice.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.041
- She calls it
a doll's tea party,

22:07.125 --> 22:09.416
but she doesn't say
if the guests are the dolls

22:09.500 --> 22:10.833
or if she provides them.

22:10.916 --> 22:12.583
You will go, but not Gladys.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.666
Why not?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.666
- You know perfectly well
why not.

22:15.750 --> 22:16.750
Mother.

22:16.833 --> 22:19.500
It's a doll's tea party,
not an embassy ball.

22:19.583 --> 22:22.416
Besides, Carrie Astor
will be there,

22:22.500 --> 22:24.208
and the Gardiner sisters
and some others

22:24.291 --> 22:25.916
whom Gladys ought to know.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.708
I agree.

22:27.791 --> 22:29.166
What harm would it do?

22:29.250 --> 22:31.291
- Why do you think Miss Astor
will be there?

22:31.375 --> 22:33.250
- She's a favorite
of Mrs. Fish.

22:36.708 --> 22:38.083
Hmm.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.916
Oh, very well.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.791
You know I'm helpless when
you all gang up against me.

22:47.291 --> 22:49.000
- I'm afraid
I've embarrassed you.

22:49.083 --> 22:50.833
- On the contrary.
I'm flattered.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.666
But first,
I need to know the menu.

22:52.750 --> 22:54.375
- What difference
does that make?

22:54.458 --> 22:56.875
- If you were to serve
asparagus, for example,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.125
you would lay a finger bowl
but no cutlery.

22:59.208 --> 23:00.791
The English eat it
with their fingers.

23:00.875 --> 23:03.041
Americans do not.
That sort of thing.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.875
- Well, the main course
will be French.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.958
But the mistress would like
to embellish it

23:08.041 --> 23:10.000
with some English dishes.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.958
I would value your advice.

23:12.041 --> 23:13.791
- I'll send over
some suggestions.

23:13.875 --> 23:17.125
Then, when the choice is made,
you can lay the table.

23:17.208 --> 23:20.125
I'll inspect it and iron out
any irregularities.

23:20.208 --> 23:22.666
- Very good.
- And now I'll take my leave.

23:28.291 --> 23:29.958
What do you think?

23:31.291 --> 23:33.916
Let's avoid asparagus.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.666
- Wait!

23:49.541 --> 23:52.208
Larry, you came.

23:52.291 --> 23:54.833
And you brought your sister.
I'm so happy.

23:54.916 --> 23:56.291
- It's very kind of you
to invite me.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.166
Nonsense. Now, come on in.

24:00.708 --> 24:03.291
This is my baby's party,
really.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.791
Isn't it, honey?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.333
Now, we all pick a doll,

24:09.416 --> 24:11.291
and we make sure they have
enough to eat and drink

24:11.375 --> 24:12.958
throughout the afternoon.

24:13.041 --> 24:15.375
Oh. Excuse me.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.833
What do we do now?

24:19.916 --> 24:23.250
- I don't know.
Not pick a doll.

24:30.541 --> 24:33.291
Hello. Not a good moment?

24:33.375 --> 24:36.333
- Of course it is.
It's nice to see you.

24:36.416 --> 24:37.791
And is this your sister?

24:37.875 --> 24:40.875
- Miss Astor, may I present
Miss Gladys Russell?

24:40.958 --> 24:42.500
- We were wondering
what we were supposed to do

24:42.583 --> 24:43.791
- with the dolls.
- Don't worry.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.916
Mamie gets these wild ideas
for her parties,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
but people pay no attention.

24:48.083 --> 24:50.000
There are normal sandwiches
at the end of the room.

24:50.083 --> 24:53.083
- Oh, look,
there's Billy Drayton.

24:53.166 --> 24:54.541
Will you excuse me?

24:59.875 --> 25:01.625
- Would you like me
to fetch you a cup of tea?

25:01.708 --> 25:04.208
- Or something to eat?
- No, thank you.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.541
- Maybe you'd rather be
on your own.

25:06.625 --> 25:08.583
- No, I'll be all right
in a minute.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.125
The fact is,
I have a very difficult mother.

25:19.666 --> 25:22.125
- Well, I know
what that's like.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.458
- Your mother could not
possibly be

25:23.541 --> 25:25.375
- as difficult as mine.
- No?

25:25.458 --> 25:27.041
My mother keeps me
under house arrest.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.541
I'm allowed no friends.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.291
God forbid
I should speak to a man.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.791
- Why has she let you
come here?

25:34.041 --> 25:35.541
My brother persuaded her.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.041
But she'll regret it,
and I'll pay.

25:38.125 --> 25:39.708
Shall I come and visit you?

25:39.791 --> 25:41.333
I could bring you a cake
with a file in it.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.916
What's your quarrel about?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.458
What do you think?

25:46.541 --> 25:47.791
A man, of course.

25:47.875 --> 25:50.000
- Who's not good enough
for you?

25:50.083 --> 25:52.583
So she says, but he is.

25:52.666 --> 25:54.416
- We're really going
to have to shake on that.

26:00.208 --> 26:02.291
What's this?

26:02.375 --> 26:05.000
- You know what it is.
A salad fork.

26:05.083 --> 26:07.916
- We never lay a fork
without a knife

26:08.000 --> 26:09.750
or a spoon to partner it.

26:09.833 --> 26:12.416
Nor is salad a course
on its own.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.541
It is eaten with the entrée
or the remove

26:14.625 --> 26:15.666
on salad plates

26:15.750 --> 26:18.000
which fit the curve
of a larger dish.

26:21.166 --> 26:24.250
And what is this?

26:24.333 --> 26:26.666
- What does it look like,
Mr. Bannister?

26:26.750 --> 26:28.500
A spoon for the coffee.

26:28.583 --> 26:32.333
- No teaspoon is ever laid
on an English table.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.041
If one is needed,
it is supplied

26:34.125 --> 26:36.500
at the apposite moment.

26:36.583 --> 26:38.208
Mrs. Russell. Good day to you.

26:39.916 --> 26:41.041
- My maid told me
you were here.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.333
This is very kind.

26:42.416 --> 26:43.500
- I am pleased
to be of assistance.

26:43.583 --> 26:46.125
- There are so many snares
designed to catch us out.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.166
- We have it under control,
ma'am.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.500
- I'm afraid I've asked
too much of you, Church.

26:51.583 --> 26:52.791
It wasn't fair of me.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.500
Mr. Bannister,
for all our sakes,

26:54.583 --> 26:56.666
Is there any chance I can
prevail on you to take charge?

26:56.750 --> 26:58.625
- At the luncheon
for Mr. McAllister?

26:58.708 --> 27:00.875
Exactly. On Friday the 18th.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.125
I would be so grateful.

27:02.208 --> 27:03.958
- Ma'am,
I'm sure we can manage.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.625
- I won't be so cruel
as to make you try.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.000
What do you say, Mr. Bannister?

27:08.083 --> 27:09.708
Would Mrs. Van Rhijn
ever allow it?

27:09.791 --> 27:12.041
- I'm afraid there'd
be a problem, madam.

27:12.125 --> 27:13.916
I cannot pretend otherwise.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.541
- Well, I hope it's a problem
that $100 will solve.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.041
$100?

27:20.125 --> 27:22.541
- I understand
I'm asking a lot.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.666
You can rely on me, madam.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.000
Don't give it another thought.

27:27.083 --> 27:28.083
In two days' time,

27:28.166 --> 27:30.250
Mr. Church and I
will finalize the setting.

27:30.333 --> 27:32.833
- But what position
would I occupy?

27:32.916 --> 27:34.000
I must be here.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.833
Mr. Bannister
is not familiar with the house.

27:35.916 --> 27:37.541
- You can settle that
between you.

27:39.416 --> 27:40.833
I do not quite understand

27:40.916 --> 27:43.333
how I am to present this
to the staff.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.750
- Why not tell them the truth,
Church?

27:45.833 --> 27:48.875
There are some situations
where it really can be helpful.

28:26.833 --> 28:28.541
You want me to be the butler?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.375
- Don't make so much of it,
boy.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.458
I want you to serve
a perfectly routine luncheon

28:33.541 --> 28:34.666
to two elderly ladies.

28:34.750 --> 28:35.750
That is all.

28:35.833 --> 28:37.208
What'll we tell the others?

28:37.291 --> 28:39.958
Family business obliges me
to be away for a few hours.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.250
It's one luncheon,
for heaven's sake.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.833
I'll do it, Mr. Bannister.

28:45.916 --> 28:47.750
But will you explain
to Mrs. Van Rhijn?

28:47.833 --> 28:49.208
Of course.

28:49.291 --> 28:50.458
Better you than me.

28:56.833 --> 28:59.250
- I don't see much point
in a Lenox Library.

28:59.333 --> 29:01.458
Of course, it's wonderful
to find a Gutenberg Bible,

29:01.541 --> 29:03.458
even behind glass, but there's
nothing you can touch,

29:03.541 --> 29:04.791
let alone read.

29:04.875 --> 29:07.916
- They should call it a museum.
- Exactly.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.125
Now I need a cab.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.916
I said I'd be
with Mrs. Chamberlain by 4:00.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.666
- What will you tell your aunts
when you get home?

29:12.750 --> 29:14.833
- I'll say I went with you
to the Lenox Library,

29:14.916 --> 29:16.208
which will be true.

29:16.291 --> 29:17.458
Hmm.

29:18.625 --> 29:21.375
- Mr. Russell.
- Miss Brook.

29:21.458 --> 29:22.833
- Miss Scott,
my aunt's secretary.

29:22.916 --> 29:23.875
How do you do?

29:23.958 --> 29:26.041
- What are you up to
in an architect's office?

29:26.125 --> 29:27.666
You can't be planning
to build another house.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.500
McKim, Mead, and White built
our present house,

29:29.583 --> 29:30.500
opposite you.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.000
- I know.
Are you making changes?

29:32.083 --> 29:34.125
Seems very splendid to me.

29:34.208 --> 29:35.958
You know...

29:39.750 --> 29:41.666
I'll tell you
if you won't give me away.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.291
How intriguing.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.291
- I'm interested in a career
in architecture.

29:45.375 --> 29:47.333
I've been talking to Mr. White
about a job.

29:47.416 --> 29:49.875
- I thought you were a banker.
Don't you work for your father?

29:49.958 --> 29:51.250
Banking is part of it.

29:51.333 --> 29:53.750
But also railroads, steel,
real estate.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.041
- Won't that bring you
into contact with architects?

29:56.125 --> 29:57.333
Not enough.

29:57.416 --> 29:59.875
I want to train properly
and build up a practice.

29:59.958 --> 30:02.708
- I applaud your enthusiasm,
and I envy your freedom.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.875
My freedom may require work.

30:04.958 --> 30:06.458
Oh?

30:06.541 --> 30:08.541
- And I'd be grateful
if you didn't mention this

30:08.625 --> 30:09.625
to my parents.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.208
My father's been going
through a tough time.

30:11.291 --> 30:12.625
I don't want to make it worse.

30:12.708 --> 30:14.833
- I promise, but won't
Mr. White say something?

30:14.916 --> 30:16.541
- He's going to help me
persuade them.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.333
At least, I hope he is.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.708
- It's a brave man who
contradicts his own clients.

30:20.791 --> 30:22.583
- And that is why
you must wish me luck.

30:22.666 --> 30:25.250
I do. Most sincerely.

30:25.333 --> 30:26.791
Now I'll bid you good day.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.583
I'm expected at the office.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.250
He seems nice.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.625
I think he is nice.

30:39.708 --> 30:41.041
Here we are.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.416
<i>- I suppose</i>
<i>they want money from me.</i>

30:45.500 --> 30:46.958
<i>- Mrs. Russell gave</i>
<i>a large sum,</i>

30:47.041 --> 30:49.250
and now she has a seat
on the board.

30:49.333 --> 30:51.250
You are pure, my dear.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.666
- But there will be no seat
on the board for me,

30:53.750 --> 30:55.833
or every other seat
would be empty.

30:55.916 --> 30:58.916
Still, they were clever
to send you.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.208
- I was the only one
who knew you.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.000
- You were the only one
who would admit it.

31:07.375 --> 31:08.708
It seems very hard

31:08.791 --> 31:11.083
that you should be punished
in perpetuity.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.833
I suppose you know my story.

31:18.916 --> 31:20.791
I know what they say.

31:22.875 --> 31:24.958
- Well, to you I'll confess
that what they say

31:25.041 --> 31:27.125
is the unvarnished truth.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.625
I was with the husband
of another woman

31:31.708 --> 31:34.291
while she was still alive.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.666
I broke the rules.

31:36.750 --> 31:39.000
- I'm on the brink
of breaking them myself.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.375
My aunt's rules, anyway.

31:43.833 --> 31:46.125
Tell me.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.583
There's a man.

31:47.666 --> 31:50.083
Respectable, hardworking.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.000
A successful attorney, in fact.

31:52.083 --> 31:55.083
But my aunts believe him to be
an unworthy adventurer

31:55.166 --> 31:56.833
who's using me to get ahead.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.083
And you disagree?

31:58.166 --> 32:00.041
- He doesn't need me
to get into society.

32:00.125 --> 32:03.208
He's already there.
And I have no money.

32:03.291 --> 32:05.166
So why would he pursue me
if it wasn't true?

32:05.250 --> 32:07.000
Well, what do you plan to do?

32:07.083 --> 32:08.208
It's so difficult.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.833
We meet
for a few stolen moments

32:09.916 --> 32:11.083
in the park or the opera.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.666
- In other words,
you hardly know him,

32:12.750 --> 32:13.791
and your aunts are against it.

32:13.875 --> 32:14.875
But what do they know?

32:14.958 --> 32:17.833
- A great deal
about how this city works.

32:19.250 --> 32:21.208
I don't regret my choice,
not for a moment,

32:21.291 --> 32:22.875
because I knew a great love.

32:22.958 --> 32:26.916
But without it, my path
would have been a stony one.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.625
- How can I know
if it is a great love

32:28.708 --> 32:31.791
if I'm not allowed to see him
for more than a minute?

32:35.875 --> 32:40.166
- Then meet him here, and take
some time to talk it through.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.541
I will invite him
when you tell me.

32:43.916 --> 32:46.458
Why would you do that for me?

32:46.541 --> 32:49.833
- Because you are
the first woman in New York

32:49.916 --> 32:54.166
who has shown me any respect
since my Augustus died.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.875
Things were different

32:55.958 --> 32:58.791
when he was alive,
as you can imagine.

32:58.875 --> 33:03.666
But when he was buried,
so was my life in this town.

33:08.958 --> 33:10.541
- I try to talk with him
when we meet,

33:10.625 --> 33:13.000
- but she watches me like a hawk.

33:14.083 --> 33:15.208
- Church said
you had a visitor.

33:16.750 --> 33:19.000
- Mother,
may I present Miss Astor.

33:19.083 --> 33:20.625
Miss Astor, I'm delighted.

33:20.708 --> 33:22.166
Gladys and Larry
have spoken of you.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.833
- I just looked in
to see if Gladys could join

33:23.916 --> 33:25.791
a few friends of mine
for a luncheon next week.

33:25.875 --> 33:27.916
- Where?
- At my mother's house.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.750
On 34th and 5th.
Just a few people.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.583
Well, Gladys isn't out yet.

33:32.666 --> 33:34.500
She will be soon, won't she?

33:34.583 --> 33:36.416
This house would be
quite perfect for a ball.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.625
Thank you, and don't worry.

33:37.708 --> 33:39.541
She'll have a ball
when the time is right.

33:39.625 --> 33:41.791
- Maybe we could arrange
a quadrille for it?

33:41.875 --> 33:43.791
We did that at my party,
and people loved it.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.291
You danced quadrilles?

33:45.375 --> 33:47.500
- No, I mean
groups of men and girls

33:47.583 --> 33:49.000
rehearsed various dances
that they performed

33:49.083 --> 33:50.041
before the guests.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.583
With special costumes
and everything.

33:51.666 --> 33:54.375
- How charming that sounds.
- Doesn't it?

33:54.458 --> 33:56.125
- Think what you'd like
to dance, Gladys.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.041
Perhaps Miss Astor can help.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.958
Ring down for tea
if Miss Astor would like some.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.500
Heavens.

34:06.583 --> 34:07.916
Normally any mention
of my debut,

34:08.000 --> 34:09.125
and she runs for the hills.

34:09.208 --> 34:12.416
- Oh?
She seemed to like the idea.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.500
- She did.
Will wonders never cease?

34:18.041 --> 34:20.791
- What sort of family business?
Do you have any family here?

34:20.875 --> 34:23.625
- No, but there are
some matters

34:23.708 --> 34:25.291
that require legal advice.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.333
- And why must it be
at lunchtime?

34:27.416 --> 34:29.750
Won't the lawyer want
to eat some luncheon?

34:29.833 --> 34:32.416
Or is he a fasting monk?

34:32.500 --> 34:33.583
No.

34:33.666 --> 34:34.625
Then go in the morning,

34:34.708 --> 34:36.583
and service our luncheon
when we need it.

34:36.666 --> 34:40.625
- But he only opens his office
from noon to 3:00, ma'am.

34:40.708 --> 34:43.083
And it will take three hours?

34:43.166 --> 34:44.416
I fear so.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.041
- Bannister is throwing us over
to see a lawyer

34:47.125 --> 34:48.833
who fasts at lunchtime.

34:48.916 --> 34:50.291
But how interesting.

34:50.375 --> 34:53.375
Is he a Muslim,
and is it Ramadan?

34:55.083 --> 34:56.500
You'd better go down

34:56.583 --> 34:58.916
and send up Armstrong
to help me change.

35:01.291 --> 35:02.291
What would we say

35:02.375 --> 35:04.958
if a surgeon suddenly
flung down his scalpel

35:05.041 --> 35:06.916
and went off to see
a fasting lawyer?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.791
I'm sure he has a reason.

35:08.875 --> 35:10.291
Hmm.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.958
Benedict Arnold had a reason

35:12.041 --> 35:14.541
when he tried to sell
West Point to the British.

35:17.333 --> 35:18.750
- Are you ready to go down,
dear?

35:18.833 --> 35:19.791
Almost.

35:19.875 --> 35:21.833
- Then I'll wait,
and we can walk together.

35:23.166 --> 35:26.458
Now, I think you're lunching
with Mrs. Russell tomorrow?

35:26.541 --> 35:27.791
Yes.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.708
- I just wondered if we could
stay off the subject tonight.

35:30.791 --> 35:32.541
Agnes has had a run-in
with Bannister,

35:32.625 --> 35:34.083
and I'd rather keep
the evening smooth.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.750
- I won't bring it up.
What's Bannister done?

35:36.833 --> 35:38.375
I'm not certain.

35:38.458 --> 35:39.833
He seems to have got involved

35:39.916 --> 35:41.416
with some sort
of religious lawyer

35:41.500 --> 35:43.958
who thinks we're wrong
to eat luncheon.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.583
But I may be a bit muddled.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.458
You seem very preoccupied.

35:52.541 --> 35:53.833
You're right, ma'am.

35:53.916 --> 35:56.666
I do have something things
on my mind.

35:56.750 --> 35:57.833
Such as?

35:57.916 --> 35:59.375
- Miss Scott has written
an article,

35:59.458 --> 36:01.666
and they say
it's widely talked of.

36:01.750 --> 36:04.541
I'm just concerned they might
trace her back to this house.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.500
- I hope this concern
has nothing to do

36:06.583 --> 36:08.666
with your prejudice
against Miss Scott.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.083
Prejudice, ma'am?

36:10.166 --> 36:11.916
Please learn to control it.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.375
Why do you say that, ma'am?

36:13.458 --> 36:16.166
I will say more.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.083
If you continue
to try to make trouble

36:18.166 --> 36:20.875
for Miss Scott,
I will be angry.

36:20.958 --> 36:22.458
You are warned.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.291
Well, it will have to do.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.750
Thank you, Armstrong.

36:29.833 --> 36:32.541
And learn some charity
in the future.

36:37.791 --> 36:40.708
- Has Pinkerton really not
come up with anything yet?

36:40.791 --> 36:42.416
- They've come up
with a great deal.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.208
They'll have something solid
for us soon.

36:45.291 --> 36:47.208
- Because we're finalizing
the design for the station.

36:47.291 --> 36:48.875
- I know.
- Of course you do.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.291
But I can't have this
hanging over me.

36:52.375 --> 36:55.458
- They will have something
for us, I assure you.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.958
- Mr. Bannister,
before you go.

37:02.041 --> 37:03.458
Can it wait?

37:03.541 --> 37:05.833
- Well, it isn't
life and death.

37:05.916 --> 37:08.833
- Good.
Then tell me this afternoon.

37:55.333 --> 37:57.458
Well, Mr. Church,
won't you join us?

38:02.041 --> 38:04.125
You all have clean gloves?

38:04.208 --> 38:05.291
We do, sir.

38:05.375 --> 38:07.500
- Only put them on
when you are about to enter

38:07.583 --> 38:10.583
the dining room, and remove
them as soon as you come out.

38:10.666 --> 38:13.125
That's it. Dismissed.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.000
Is everything ready, monsieur?

38:15.083 --> 38:16.750
Ready, if strange.

38:16.833 --> 38:19.000
Why is chilled vichyssoise
English?

38:19.083 --> 38:20.875
Trust me. It is.

38:20.958 --> 38:22.208
- The Eton mess looks
as it sounds.

38:22.291 --> 38:23.708
A mess made by schoolboys.

38:23.791 --> 38:26.416
- Good.
I'll check the dining room.

38:29.208 --> 38:30.750
This is intolerable.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.375
- This is worse
than intolerable.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.375
It's ridiculous.

38:34.458 --> 38:37.416
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back in a moment.

38:40.083 --> 38:41.500
You've counted it twice.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.333
- I'm sure
it's all under control.

38:43.416 --> 38:44.666
That's easy for you to say.

38:44.750 --> 38:45.958
What about gloves?

38:46.041 --> 38:48.000
Are you a footman or a butler
when it comes to gloves?

38:48.083 --> 38:50.333
- Don't worry him.
- No, it's fine.

38:50.416 --> 38:51.708
Mr. Bannister says
I'm to wear the gloves

38:51.791 --> 38:54.708
when I serve the food,
but not when I pour the wine.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.375
- That sounds
a bit complicated.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.791
- He can manage.
Can't you, Jack?

38:58.875 --> 39:01.125
Yes, I can.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.958
I think I can.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.041
- Don't let your hands shake
when you pour.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.958
Why would it shake?

39:07.041 --> 39:08.250
It won't shake, will it?

39:08.333 --> 39:11.583
- Well, you'd better go in
and tell them luncheon's ready.

39:30.458 --> 39:33.000
- Miss Brook,
if you'd like to come this way.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.041
Tell Mr. Church, I am...

39:38.083 --> 39:39.833
- Bannister?
- All right?

39:44.458 --> 39:46.833
What are you doing here?

39:46.916 --> 39:49.625
- Mrs. Russell never mentioned
you were coming.

39:49.708 --> 39:52.583
- I assume Mrs. Van Rhijn
is in the dark.

39:52.666 --> 39:54.125
- Mm-hmm.

39:54.208 --> 39:56.750
- Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

40:46.083 --> 40:48.666
- Mr. McAllister,
you are most welcome.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.083
An English butler.

40:51.166 --> 40:53.333
That's a good start.

40:53.416 --> 40:55.833
I'm only sorry
I'm underdressed.

40:55.916 --> 40:57.333
Sir?

40:57.416 --> 40:59.625
- Feel I should be
in court livery

40:59.708 --> 41:02.541
with a periwig and red heels.

41:09.708 --> 41:12.500
<i>- And of course,</i>
<i>you must join us...</i>

41:12.583 --> 41:14.708
Mr. Ward McAllister.

41:16.500 --> 41:19.208
- What surroundings,
Mrs. Russell.

41:19.291 --> 41:22.750
We could be at Tsarskoye Selo.

41:22.833 --> 41:24.833
- Ah.
- Yes.

41:24.916 --> 41:27.125
Catherine the Great would feel
quite at home here.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.666
In so many ways.

41:28.750 --> 41:30.666
- Mr. Russell.
- Mr. McAllister.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.666
How flattering you all are.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.500
You admire the empress?

41:34.583 --> 41:36.333
- Do you?
- Of course.

41:36.416 --> 41:38.833
She reminds me of Mrs. Astor.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.333
- I suppose your life
in New York

41:42.416 --> 41:44.416
continues as splendidly
as ever?

41:44.500 --> 41:46.541
- Not at splendid
as this house.

41:46.625 --> 41:48.625
But I'm off to the opera
again tonight,

41:48.708 --> 41:50.750
and I have a ball on Saturday
with the Dreesmanns

41:50.833 --> 41:52.583
- on Long Island.
- Heavens.

41:52.666 --> 41:54.666
How can I compete with that?

41:56.041 --> 42:00.208
- Meanwhile,
I want to see more of you.

42:00.291 --> 42:03.083
To press my advantage,
if I have it.

42:03.166 --> 42:05.875
You've not done badly so far.

42:05.958 --> 42:08.708
- Shall we go in?
- Lovely idea.

42:10.291 --> 42:12.250
Thank you so much.

42:12.333 --> 42:14.625
Miss Brook, Mr. Raikes,
Right this way.

42:38.708 --> 42:40.166
Oh, look how pretty...

42:40.250 --> 42:42.458
Hyacinths and lilac.

42:42.541 --> 42:44.791
At this time of year?

42:44.875 --> 42:47.083
Next you will make
the blind see

42:47.166 --> 42:49.583
- and the lame walk.

42:49.666 --> 42:50.916
Come and sit by me.

43:08.041 --> 43:10.958
- What?
- What's this?

43:11.041 --> 43:12.583
- Oh.
- Wow.

43:12.666 --> 43:15.291
I wanted one just like this.

43:15.375 --> 43:16.500
It's enchanting.

43:19.750 --> 43:22.333
My, my, my.

43:24.791 --> 43:26.666
You have outdone yourself.

43:26.750 --> 43:28.208
Indeed, you have.

43:28.291 --> 43:29.708
It's not too much?

43:29.791 --> 43:31.958
My dear Mrs. Russell.

43:32.041 --> 43:34.208
Nothing is ever too much
for me.

43:53.791 --> 43:56.625
- Should you be wearing gloves
if you're the butler today?

43:56.708 --> 43:58.208
- Mr. Bannister told me
to wear them

43:58.291 --> 43:59.583
when I was serving
the food, ma'am.

43:59.666 --> 44:02.541
- Oh.
- You are the butler now, John.

44:02.625 --> 44:04.708
Not Bannister.

44:04.791 --> 44:09.041
Who throws us over on a whim
to please an itinerant monk.

44:09.125 --> 44:10.083
Thank you, ma'am.

44:11.875 --> 44:13.416
May we have some more wine?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.208
May I have something to eat?

44:40.291 --> 44:41.916
Bannister seems
to have made things

44:42.000 --> 44:43.666
very complicated for you.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.916
Well, don't worry.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.875
We'll report back to him
that you've passed your test

44:52.958 --> 44:54.083
with flying colors.

44:54.166 --> 44:55.708
- We will not give him
the satisfaction

44:55.791 --> 44:57.416
of thinking he was missed.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.458
This was on the mat.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.875
- It's just been delivered,
ma'am.

45:20.875 --> 45:23.625
- What?
- Agnes?

45:25.791 --> 45:28.083
This is too much!

45:28.166 --> 45:29.791
Agnes?

45:29.875 --> 45:31.916
Don't do anything
you'll regret.

45:35.583 --> 45:38.583
May I have some wine now?

45:38.666 --> 45:40.333
You can leave your gloves on.

45:51.250 --> 45:52.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

46:20.708 --> 46:24.583
- Bannister.
Do my eyes deceive me?

46:24.666 --> 46:26.458
- Well, you see--

46:26.541 --> 46:29.750
Aunt Agnes, what a surprise.

46:29.833 --> 46:32.375
Mrs. Russell never said
you were coming.

46:32.458 --> 46:34.166
- She's just looked in
to pay her compliments

46:34.250 --> 46:36.375
to Mr. McAllister,
haven't you, Aunt Agnes?

46:36.458 --> 46:37.708
Mrs. Van Rhijn.

46:37.791 --> 46:39.166
I think you know everyone.

46:39.250 --> 46:43.125
- You remember Mr. Raikes?
- How could I forget him?

46:43.208 --> 46:45.000
- Can we persuade you
to sit down and join us,

46:45.083 --> 46:46.541
Mrs. Van Rhijn?

46:46.625 --> 46:48.583
- I expect we've had luncheon
rather earlier

46:48.666 --> 46:50.000
than you imagined.

46:50.083 --> 46:51.875
- You thought we'd still be
in the drawing room.

46:51.958 --> 46:53.291
Didn't you, Aunt?

47:03.458 --> 47:05.958
- I mustn't interrupt
your party.

47:06.041 --> 47:07.291
- It's so kind of you
to look in

47:07.375 --> 47:09.500
when I know how busy you are.

47:09.583 --> 47:11.500
I should go.

47:11.583 --> 47:14.500
Marian was right.
I must have misread the clock.

47:14.583 --> 47:16.750
- Next time, I hope we can
persuade you to stay.

47:19.958 --> 47:21.750
Heads have rolled for less.

47:26.791 --> 47:29.416
- A nice surprise,
dear Aunt Agnes.

47:29.500 --> 47:32.291
- We're all very neighborly
here on 61st Street.

47:32.375 --> 47:33.958
Aren't we, Miss Brook?

47:34.041 --> 47:36.083
- I must come back
if your luncheons

47:36.166 --> 47:37.916
are always this lively.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.333
Is it a nice place to work?

47:42.416 --> 47:45.916
- Well, it's new and everything
is of the highest quality.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.541
But she is queen
of all she surveys.

47:48.625 --> 47:50.541
And quite a demanding queen
at that.

47:50.625 --> 47:51.875
I can imagine.

47:51.958 --> 47:54.208
- The one you need to win over
is Mr. Russell.

47:54.291 --> 47:55.833
Oh? I've been working on her.

47:55.916 --> 47:57.625
You implied she made
all the decisions.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.333
That's true as a rule,

47:59.416 --> 48:01.291
but the master loves
his daughter.

48:01.375 --> 48:02.791
He'd never agree to any suitor

48:02.875 --> 48:04.000
if he didn't think
he'd make her happy.

48:04.083 --> 48:05.125
Hmm.

48:05.208 --> 48:06.500
What shall I do?

48:06.583 --> 48:08.625
- Show him sympathy
and loyalty now.

48:08.708 --> 48:10.458
- You didn't when he was having
his fight with the aldermen,

48:10.541 --> 48:11.875
and that counted against you.

48:11.958 --> 48:13.958
- I'll write to him
about the train crash

48:14.041 --> 48:15.291
and how sorry I am.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.041
- He's worried about it,
of course.

48:17.125 --> 48:18.125
But he seems to be concerned

48:18.208 --> 48:20.000
about what the police
may discover.

48:22.208 --> 48:24.750
Has he done anything wrong?

48:24.833 --> 48:26.250
How should I know?

48:26.333 --> 48:28.625
I'm only telling you
that he's vulnerable.

48:28.708 --> 48:31.458
- And when you're vulnerable,
you appreciate support.

48:32.833 --> 48:33.791
I should be going.

48:33.875 --> 48:35.333
- Aren't you forgetting
something?

48:35.416 --> 48:37.791
I haven't forgotten.

48:37.875 --> 48:39.750
- But I don't do it
for the money.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.000
I'm well aware of that.

48:42.083 --> 48:45.833
You want your revenge
for some reason.

48:45.916 --> 48:47.750
But I don't need to know why.

49:21.708 --> 49:23.708
<i>I felt sorry for Aunt Agnes.</i>

49:23.791 --> 49:25.875
Sorry for her
and ashamed of myself.

49:25.958 --> 49:27.250
You'd done nothing wrong.

49:27.333 --> 49:29.041
If you'd seen her there.

49:29.125 --> 49:32.666
Alone and surrounded like
Custer at Little Big Horn,

49:32.750 --> 49:35.041
facing the annihilation
of everything she believes.

49:35.125 --> 49:37.708
- Why not help her to find
a place for herself

49:37.791 --> 49:39.416
in the new world?

49:39.500 --> 49:41.750
Easier said than done.

49:41.833 --> 49:44.000
- What happens next?
- Who knows.

49:44.083 --> 49:45.375
She won't speak to me.

49:47.791 --> 49:49.916
I hear you did well today,
John.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.333
- Thank you, Mr. Bannister.
I'm glad you've been told that.

49:52.416 --> 49:54.333
And I'm sorry I gave her
the letter.

49:54.416 --> 49:55.625
Not your fault.

49:55.708 --> 49:57.916
But I need to find out
who wrote it.

50:00.458 --> 50:02.833
I should talk
to Miss Armstrong.

50:02.916 --> 50:05.541
She has an ear for what's
going on in the other house.

50:05.625 --> 50:07.583
Don't jump to conclusions.

50:20.375 --> 50:22.208
- Would you like
some warm milk, ma'am,

50:22.291 --> 50:23.583
to calm you down?

50:28.291 --> 50:32.416
- I allowed myself to act
on impulse today, Armstrong.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.166
Something I never do.

50:36.541 --> 50:38.333
To act on impulse...

50:39.875 --> 50:42.666
Is to make oneself a hostage
to ridicule.

50:44.500 --> 50:48.083
- I'm sure these betrayals
must be very upsetting.

50:51.166 --> 50:53.833
- What do you mean,
"these betrayals"?

50:53.916 --> 50:56.125
Have there been others?

50:56.208 --> 50:58.541
It was just something I saw.

50:58.625 --> 51:00.125
I thought you knew.

51:02.041 --> 51:04.333
Knew what?

51:04.416 --> 51:06.375
About Mr. Oscar.

51:07.375 --> 51:09.875
Tell me. At once.

51:21.583 --> 51:24.416
Mrs. Russell's maid?

51:24.500 --> 51:25.708
Are you sure?

51:25.791 --> 51:27.291
- Servants
in neighboring houses

51:27.375 --> 51:28.958
do know each other, madam.

51:30.791 --> 51:32.375
Leave me.

51:32.458 --> 51:34.166
- Should I give a message
to Mr. Bannister--

51:34.250 --> 51:35.333
Never mind Bannister.

51:35.416 --> 51:37.000
What is Bannister to this?

51:37.083 --> 51:38.500
- So there's nothing more
you need?

51:38.583 --> 51:40.375
Leave me! Now!

52:01.291 --> 52:02.666
I'm going to bed.

52:02.750 --> 52:05.125
I want to thank you
for your help today.

52:05.208 --> 52:07.625
I think it was a success,
don't you?

52:07.708 --> 52:10.375
Thank God for Aurora Fane
and Miss Brooks saving us

52:10.458 --> 52:12.666
from the wrath
of Mrs. Van Rhijn.

52:12.750 --> 52:14.416
What's that?

52:14.500 --> 52:15.833
That's from Clay.

52:17.083 --> 52:19.708
He says they found the man
responsible for the axles.

52:19.791 --> 52:21.375
His name is Dixon.

52:21.458 --> 52:23.208
He's the head of the team
that built the engine.

52:23.291 --> 52:25.125
- Of course he would be.
- Good.

52:27.125 --> 52:28.541
- He's told them
I gave the order.

52:28.625 --> 52:29.958
That's ridiculous.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.666
The police say he has proof.

52:33.750 --> 52:35.125
Written proof.
