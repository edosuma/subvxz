Can I see?

01:03.417 --> 01:04.792
You have
the most beautiful

01:04.875 --> 01:06.792

01:06.875 --> 01:08.750

01:08.834 --> 01:10.959
Beauty is an illusion.

Excuse me,

02:44.291 --> 02:46.583
I should talk
to Detective Rush.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.291
I'm Rush.

This is

you guys something?

02:52.667 --> 02:53.709
You got a name?

02:53.792 --> 02:54.917
Kara Dhiet.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.500
How 'bout you?

02:56.583 --> 02:57.709
Booker.

02:57.792 --> 02:58.750
(Kara)
'You know about eBay.'

02:58.834 --> 03:00.709
- 'Right?'
- Vaguely.

03:00.792 --> 03:02.875
(Kara)
'Cause I was fooling around
looking for some textbooks

03:02.959 --> 03:05.625
when I came across this..

03:05.709 --> 03:07.250
'...it was
my mother's bracelet.'

03:07.333 --> 03:08.250
Okay.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.333
I'm wearing it here.

03:11.417 --> 03:12.750
'That was a few days
before my parents'

03:12.834 --> 03:14.834
were killed.

03:14.917 --> 03:15.834
When was that?

03:15.917 --> 03:17.875
July, '91.
I called it in.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.834
- You were there?
- In the neighborhood.

03:19.917 --> 03:22.625
- Your connection to Kara is?
- Friend.

03:22.709 --> 03:24.333
(Kara)
'They were shot
in a home invasion.'

03:24.417 --> 03:26.417
I was too young at the time
to know what got stolen

03:26.500 --> 03:28.250
but now,
I remember this bracelet.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.542
And you think
whoever killed

03:29.625 --> 03:30.834
your parents
stole it that night.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.375
Maybe, if you find
the eBay dealer

03:32.458 --> 03:33.834
then you can
trace how he got it.

03:33.917 --> 03:35.166
It's good thinkin'.

You two live together?

03:44.417 --> 03:46.583
No, I live with
my aunt and uncle.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.125
He hangs with me
at the restaurant.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.667

03:51.917 --> 03:54.458
Hm, I know it.

03:54.542 --> 03:56.291
My dad was an architect.

03:56.375 --> 03:58.250
My mom, a dancer.

03:58.333 --> 04:02.125
I'm six years old,
everything's normal, happy..

04:02.208 --> 04:03.959
...then they're gone.

04:04.041 --> 04:07.417
My aunt and uncle
never talk about 'em.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.959
You know what
I'm saying?

04:09.041 --> 04:11.041
You wanna get the truth.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.166
Talk about
your odd couples.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.417
Hm...read my mind.

04:58.792 --> 04:59.917
Summer of '91.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.375
The height
of the crack boom.

05:01.458 --> 05:02.792
And home invasions.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.750
Theory at the time
was a robbery gone
wrong.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.375
Doer enters, thinks
no one will be there

05:06.458 --> 05:08.417
panics...and kills the couple.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.834

except maybe this bracelet.

05:10.917 --> 05:12.250

05:15.792 --> 05:17.041

recovered.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.250
(John)
'Their daughter told you'

05:18.333 --> 05:19.709
they were professionals
of some kind?

05:19.792 --> 05:21.709
Yeah, an architect
and a dancer.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.041
Says here
that he worked in construction

05:24.125 --> 05:26.417
and she was
a seamstress.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.166
Tracked down
that eBay dealer.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.583
He said he bought
the bracelet off a widow named

05:30.667 --> 05:33.000
uh...Wilma Whiting
couple of weeks ago.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.417
- She got a record?
- No.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.834
But her son is doing time
up at Frackville

05:35.917 --> 05:37.709
'for a burglary in '92.'

05:37.792 --> 05:39.417
So maybe, he gave her
the bracelet?

05:39.500 --> 05:40.667
(John)
'Now, Vera and Jeffries'

05:40.750 --> 05:41.959
are up in Frackville
on Sherman's

05:42.041 --> 05:44.083
job now.
They can pay him a visit.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.041
This Daryl Booker
came in with Kara?

05:46.125 --> 05:47.917
He wasn't just
the 911 caller

05:48.000 --> 05:49.625
he was also a suspect.

05:49.709 --> 05:52.000
Yeah, along with half
the crack heads in Kensington.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.959
No, but half the crack heads
in Kensington.

05:54.041 --> 05:55.417
aren't maintaining
a relationship

05:55.500 --> 05:56.750
with the victims'
daughter.

05:56.834 --> 05:57.750
What kind of relationship?

05:57.834 --> 05:59.000
50-year-old guy
hanging with

05:59.083 --> 06:00.709
a pretty
18-year-old
.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.250
- What do you think?
- Good Samaritan.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.083
College advisor?

06:05.166 --> 06:08.917
I'd bet a lot, it's
something
less high-minded.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.000
Detectives.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.417
Got a minute?

06:17.709 --> 06:18.917
Shoes.

06:22.041 --> 06:24.625
(Daryl)
So what's the theory?

06:24.709 --> 06:26.250
What do you got me pegged as?

06:26.333 --> 06:27.458
'Kara's pimp?'

06:27.542 --> 06:29.834
Her sugar daddy?
Black mambo?

06:30.875 --> 06:32.125
We need you
to fill us in on some

06:32.208 --> 06:34.291
missin' pieces, Booker.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.750
Like?

06:35.834 --> 06:37.166
(Scotty)
'Well, it turns out
that bracelet'

06:37.250 --> 06:39.125
was solid gold.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.250
It's valuable.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.667
We're thinking
the killer must have had

06:41.750 --> 06:43.291
some inside information

06:43.375 --> 06:45.000
'on that poor
Cambodian couple'

06:45.083 --> 06:47.250
had something
worth breaking in for.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.959
Logical.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.125
- Did you know the Dhiets?
- No.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.333
But you were
out
on that corner

06:52.417 --> 06:53.917
that night.
By their apartment?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.750
Read my statement.
That's what it says.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.709
Oh, we've read up on you,
Booker, know you served

06:57.792 --> 06:59.250
four years
for drug possession

06:59.333 --> 07:00.458
'with intent to sell.'

07:00.542 --> 07:02.291
I came home
to Philly from Vietnam

07:02.375 --> 07:03.417
and dealt smack because

07:03.500 --> 07:05.500
I picked up
the habit myself.

07:05.583 --> 07:06.917
I did my time.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.959
I got clean in prison.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.125
End of story.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.125
So, why'd the police
suspect you in '91?

07:12.208 --> 07:14.834
Black man with a record,
loitering in the area?

07:14.917 --> 07:17.250
Surprised I wasn't convicted
and locked up.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.583
How'd you come to make
that 911 call?

07:19.667 --> 07:21.291
You wouldn't understand.

07:21.375 --> 07:25.125
Try us.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.375
Help...anybody.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.792
Please.

07:44.667 --> 07:47.458
- Help!
- Damn girl.

07:47.542 --> 07:50.041
Shoo, fly.
I ain't the five-o. Go!

07:50.125 --> 07:51.250
'Please.'

07:52.625 --> 07:53.875
'They are hurt.'

08:01.083 --> 08:03.709
Come on.

08:32.959 --> 08:34.625
After that night..

08:34.709 --> 08:36.250
...I started
looking out for
Kara.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.417
What about
her aunt and uncle?

08:38.500 --> 08:39.542
They don't look out
for her?

08:39.625 --> 08:40.750
They're good people.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.750
But they work long
hours
at the restaurant.

08:42.834 --> 08:46.333
So out of the goodness
of your heart, you play daddy?

08:46.417 --> 08:48.583
Must rob you
of something,
soul-wise.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.750
Suspecting people of unsavory

08:50.834 --> 08:53.125
motives all the time.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.625
What was on her mouth

08:56.709 --> 08:57.875
that you wiped off?

08:57.959 --> 08:59.166
Piece of dirt.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.291
As complete stranger

09:00.375 --> 09:02.250
but you felt compelled
to...clean her up?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.583
Woman had
a beautiful
face..

09:04.667 --> 09:06.166
...bothered me.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.542
Any idea
who the killer might be?

09:08.625 --> 09:09.875
If I had an idea

09:09.959 --> 09:11.959
I'd have done
something about it.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.875
I want this crime solved.

09:13.959 --> 09:16.166
For Kara's sake?

09:16.250 --> 09:18.208
What I want.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.458
What she needs.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.500
- Needs?
- 'Move on with her life.'

09:21.583 --> 09:23.166
Get out of here.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.667
The girl's gifted.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.208
'Going places.'

09:29.542 --> 09:33.166
Don't forget your
shoes
on the way out.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.667
I don't deny it.

09:46.750 --> 09:47.709
I gave that bracelet

09:47.792 --> 09:49.667
to my ma
for her birthday.

09:49.750 --> 09:50.917
(Will)
Nice present.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.125
Where'd you get it?

09:52.208 --> 09:54.166
There was
a fellow
sufferer..

09:54.250 --> 09:57.166
...white dude, traded
me
that bracelet for rock

09:57.250 --> 09:58.667
back in the dark days

09:58.750 --> 10:02.000
when Satan had dominion
over my soul.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.792
This fellow sufferer,
he got a name?

10:03.875 --> 10:06.834
If I knew,
I'd tell
you.

10:06.917 --> 10:09.500
Remember his
face though.
Fugly.

10:09.583 --> 10:10.542
(Will)
'You're gonna have to do'

10:10.625 --> 10:12.083
better than that, Dolla Bill

10:12.166 --> 10:14.166
Yeah, we checked
your employment records.

10:14.250 --> 10:17.166
You've worked exactly
one legit job in your life.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.875
On a construction
crew
in '91...with Sen
Dhiet.

10:20.959 --> 10:21.959
I don't deny it.

10:22.041 --> 10:24.125
I worked with Sen.
Liked him.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.041
So you don't deny
having the bracelet

10:26.125 --> 10:27.291
and you don't deny
knowing Sen?

10:27.375 --> 10:28.917
I don't deny the truth.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.458
Truth is, you're looking good
for a double homicide, Dolla.

10:31.542 --> 10:34.250
And considering you're up
for parole in two months.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.041
Our old boss..

10:36.125 --> 10:37.333
...the foreman.

10:37.417 --> 10:38.875
Brad Atwater.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.875
That's who you
should
be talking to.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.000
- Why is that?
- Sen hated him.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.250
On account of Atwater
skimming his
paychecks.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.458
Skimming how?

10:46.542 --> 10:48.709
Atwater had Sen
by the short
hairs.

10:48.792 --> 10:51.250
Just like all the
illegals
working for him.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.375
And was Sen doing
something about it?

10:53.458 --> 10:56.208
Trying to rally
the troops in
protest..

10:56.291 --> 11:00.250
...like Moses
to the
Pharaoh.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.625
Alright, Dolla.

11:02.709 --> 11:04.083
We'll run this down.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.000
Maybe come back..

11:06.083 --> 11:08.917
...bring the picture
of fugly for you.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.500
(Brad)
We read about that home

11:10.583 --> 11:12.125
invasion at Sen's place.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.291
I met them at
the site once.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.250
She was really lovely.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.458
You happen to remember
where you were

11:16.542 --> 11:18.041
at that
night,
Mr. Atwater?

11:18.125 --> 11:19.875
Um, remember correctly

11:19.959 --> 11:21.500
I was...fixing potholes

11:21.583 --> 11:23.834
in the driveway
till, um, pretty
late.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.000
10:30.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.125
Brad's a big
do-it-yourselfer.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.250
Well, regarding your
construction crew..

11:29.333 --> 11:31.750
...we heard some talk
about you taking
kickbacks

11:31.834 --> 11:35.250
'from some
of your workers.'

11:35.333 --> 11:37.750
- I'll leave you to this.
- You need help, honey?

11:37.834 --> 11:40.375
No, I just need
to lay down.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.750
- Fibromyalgia.
- Her pain is unbelievable.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.959
We keep going to
specialists, but..

11:45.041 --> 11:47.542
Don't worry
about me.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.166
So...the kickbacks.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.500
I don't want
to get into trouble

11:53.583 --> 11:55.166
over some creative accounting.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.250
(Scotty)
'Well, we're homicide.'

11:56.333 --> 11:58.625
We're not looking at that.

11:58.709 --> 12:00.125
I had this thing going

12:00.208 --> 12:01.875
with a pal
who worked at the
INS.

12:01.959 --> 12:04.792
- He's dead now.
- What kind of thing?

12:04.875 --> 12:06.792
At that time
I had five kids.

12:06.875 --> 12:07.959
One on the way.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.125
Plus my wife's
medical
condition--

12:09.208 --> 12:11.333
The...the thing?

12:11.417 --> 12:14.625
We would go on
raids,
busting illegals.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.250
Gave work visas to the ones
who had something to trade.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.625
And sent them your way?

12:18.709 --> 12:20.875
And we'd both get a
cut
of their paychecks.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.917
But Sen and Channary
were legals.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
They had work permits.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.083
Their permits were legal

12:25.166 --> 12:26.333
but they weren't.

12:40.875 --> 12:41.959
(male #1)
'Freeze!'

12:43.375 --> 12:45.500
Nobody move.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.250
Get up against the wall.

12:50.083 --> 12:53.333
Everybody keep your hands
where we can see them.

12:53.417 --> 12:56.583
(male #2)
'Get up against the wall.'

12:57.500 --> 13:02.208
'You heard me,
come here, now.'

13:02.291 --> 13:04.208
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

13:04.291 --> 13:05.792
Please, you must let us go.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.125
We'll be in great
danger
if we are sent back.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.083
Shut it.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.333
No, I will not let you.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.333
Not let me?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.166
You have a passport,
my friend?

13:14.250 --> 13:16.333
A visa?

13:17.625 --> 13:20.917
I have something else.

13:23.500 --> 13:27.709
Khmer ruby. Very rare.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.917
Let me see what I can do.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.458
(male #3)
'Right there, don't move.'

13:40.625 --> 13:43.000
Well, it's your
lucky day, ruby boy.

13:43.083 --> 13:46.208
I got two legit
work visas for you.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.291
These are the Dhiets' visas.

13:52.375 --> 13:55.375
(Mark)
You don't want 'em?
Fine.

13:55.458 --> 13:59.375
Back home they
kill the kids too, right?

14:03.333 --> 14:04.917
Is there no other way?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.375
Legit work visas
don't grow on trees.

14:08.458 --> 14:09.583
'So what's it going to be?'

14:09.667 --> 14:12.625
Life or death?

14:12.709 --> 14:14.250
They were easy targets.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.250
I-I was in such a money jam.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.583
This other couple..

14:17.667 --> 14:19.417
...the real Dhiets,
what happened to them?

14:19.500 --> 14:20.542
Deported.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.041
Now, did that mean,
going home to

14:22.125 --> 14:24.542
poverty or worse?

14:24.625 --> 14:27.166
Worse.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.709
So by accepting those visas

14:28.792 --> 14:31.000
Sen might have got
those people killed?

14:31.083 --> 14:34.667
Like he pulled
the trigger
himself.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.291
(Scotty)
'So, tracked that
deported Cambodian couple.'

14:43.375 --> 14:44.709
It wasn't easy,
I'll tell you that.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.625
- Congratulations.
- 'So?'

14:46.709 --> 14:48.291
Well, according
to human rights watch

14:48.375 --> 14:50.667
the real Sen and Channary Dhiet
were executed

14:50.750 --> 14:53.542
three days after arriving
back in their country.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.583
So by taking
those visas, Kara's parents

14:55.667 --> 14:56.792
really did get 'em killed.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.083
Maybe, relatives
of the dead
couple

14:58.166 --> 14:59.709
show up in Philly
some time later.

14:59.792 --> 15:02.000
Wanting revenge on the
people
posing as their family.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.959
Shot 'em , then took
the bracelet as a bonus.

15:04.041 --> 15:05.375
Maybe, knowing
it was valuable.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.291
'Cause there's a special
Cambodian ability

15:07.375 --> 15:09.125
to appraise jewelry?

15:09.208 --> 15:11.417
Just offering
a theory, boss.

15:12.667 --> 15:13.750
(John)
Let's look for
Dhiet relations

15:13.834 --> 15:15.417
in and around
Philly in '91.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.458
(Nick)
'Well, Kara lives
with her aunt and uncle.'

15:17.542 --> 15:19.000
(Lilly)
'Yeah, in Kensington.'

15:19.083 --> 15:20.667
They must have known
about the name change.

15:20.750 --> 15:21.875
Their parents weren't
really Dhiets.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.333
I'll swing by
the courts, Nick.

15:23.417 --> 15:26.917
Pick up Jeffries
and pay them a visit.

15:29.959 --> 15:31.959
Sen and Channary
were good people.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.417
Except their names
weren't Sen and
Channary.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.959
Let's start by you
telling us their real names.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.917
Kara's father..

15:42.000 --> 15:43.083
...was my brother.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.000
- 'Varin Toan.'
- And his wife?

15:45.083 --> 15:48.500
Kannitha Yasovarman.

15:48.583 --> 15:49.959
Could you..

15:50.041 --> 15:51.250
...spell that?

15:51.333 --> 15:53.500
So, they came
over in '91.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.166
'90.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.500
Kannitha was a member
of the royal family.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.166
That's why they
have to leave
Cambodia.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.250
I don't follow.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.375
Regime change.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.709
Very dangerous for people
with connections to the
royals.

16:05.792 --> 16:07.917
They had to sell
everything to get
here.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.959
And get a new identity?

16:10.041 --> 16:11.166
(Nick)
Now the real Dhiets..

16:11.250 --> 16:12.291
...the ones that were deported.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.917
- Did you know them?
- No.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.792
Any of their
relatives, friends?

16:15.875 --> 16:18.917
No. No one.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.792
Sen was a good man.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.917
And his wife?

16:24.834 --> 16:26.583
Not such a good woman.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.208
How so?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.000
She was a fool.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.709
Too...proud to..

16:32.792 --> 16:34.458
...accept
who she was now.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.125
Instead of royalty, you mean.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.458
I tried to make her change

16:38.542 --> 16:40.375
but she was stubborn.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.417
Why do you always
wear that dress?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.792
Because it is beautiful.

16:47.875 --> 16:50.750
You draw too much
attention to
yourself.

16:50.834 --> 16:52.625
It is the only dress I own.

16:52.709 --> 16:55.291
So, wear pants.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.917
Stop pretending.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.208
Look at your fingers.

16:58.291 --> 16:59.750
They rough
from sewing.

16:59.834 --> 17:02.542
Look at the holes
in your stockings.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.000
They don't exist.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.709
You should dress like
the person you are
now.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.875
I am who
I have always been.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.750
No. Not here.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.667
Not anymore.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.667
Here, now.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.959
Just illusions.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.250
You, you, Mama San.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.291
What's up, baby? Love you
long time, baby, huh?

17:27.375 --> 17:31.834
Is that illusion, too?

17:45.250 --> 17:46.959
(Will)
'Had an air about her, huh?'

17:47.041 --> 17:49.458
People think that
she was better than them.

17:49.542 --> 17:50.959
That she was still rich.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.291
But she was a seamstress
in Kensington.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.750
People think
Asians hide money.

17:55.834 --> 17:58.000
Keep it secret,
under their pillow.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.875
But Sen and Channary
were broke.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.959
Except for the bracelet.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.917
Did anyone else know that
Channary was royalty?

18:05.041 --> 18:06.583
- No one.
- Not even Kara?

18:06.667 --> 18:10.333
And let her become
like her mother?

18:11.834 --> 18:13.125
(Kara)
'You got
the same amount of shrimp'

18:13.208 --> 18:15.333
in your kung pao
as igloo over there.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.417
Ah, see right here.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.375
I got eight,
he got
eleven.

18:18.458 --> 18:19.709
I counted.

18:19.792 --> 18:21.417
So what,
you want three more?

18:21.500 --> 18:25.750
Four. To make up
for the insult.

18:27.834 --> 18:30.041
Kara, got a second?

18:30.125 --> 18:33.166
Yeah, sure.
Of course.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.500
You find the bracelet?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.875
Maybe we should
talk alone.

18:38.959 --> 18:41.500
Daryl can hear
anything you gotta say.

18:41.583 --> 18:44.125
So, the bracelet?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.542
We found it.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.250
Turns out
it's very
valuable.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.792
Really?

18:50.875 --> 18:53.250
Kara, we've found out
some things about your
parents

18:53.333 --> 18:55.875
that might not be easy to hear.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.583
Like what?

18:57.667 --> 19:00.500
For one thing, they weren't
going by their real names.

19:00.583 --> 19:03.041
They weren't...Sen and Channary?

19:03.125 --> 19:04.875
They weren't Dhiets, either.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.959
How's this relevant
to their murders?

19:07.041 --> 19:08.208
They were here
illegally.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.417
And there may
have been danger

19:09.500 --> 19:11.208
associated with
them getting fake
visas.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.500
I know about immigration.

19:12.583 --> 19:13.917
People screw people over.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.208
You're not saying
that my parents

19:15.291 --> 19:17.041
did that to this
Dhiet family?

19:17.125 --> 19:18.083
It's possible.

19:18.166 --> 19:21.125
No, no way.

19:21.208 --> 19:24.375
My parents were honorable.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.625
There's more.

19:25.709 --> 19:26.917
Is it really necessary,
dete--

19:27.000 --> 19:30.625
You want to stay,
stop interfering.

19:30.709 --> 19:34.125
So...what else?

19:34.208 --> 19:37.834
Your mother,
Channary
was...royalty.

19:39.166 --> 19:40.041
What?

19:40.125 --> 19:41.375
She was part
of the royal
family.

19:41.458 --> 19:42.917
That's why they
had
to leave Cambodia

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
and probably why they
had
that valuable bracelet.

19:48.583 --> 19:49.709
Oh no.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.959
What?

19:52.041 --> 19:54.250
I-I thought
they were just stories.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.750
What were?

19:56.834 --> 19:59.166
Daddy thinks I'm
going
to be beautiful like
you

19:59.250 --> 20:00.333
but I don't think so.

20:00.417 --> 20:01.709
You're a princess.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.166
Of course, you'll
be beautiful.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.458
Beauty's on
the inside, Kara.

20:06.542 --> 20:09.166
In your veins.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.208
Can I take this
to
show-and-tell?

20:11.291 --> 20:13.250
Oh no. No.

20:13.333 --> 20:14.458
Why not?

20:14.542 --> 20:17.125
It's just a trifle.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.709
A part of something..

20:18.792 --> 20:20.709
...bigger and grander.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.291
I'll take
the whole thing then.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.792
I wish you could

20:23.875 --> 20:26.458
but the whole is...lost.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.709
Sold.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.542
I wish you could
have seen it though.

20:32.625 --> 20:36.166
All gold and rubies.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.709
(Sen)
'Look at me, Kara.'

20:44.750 --> 20:47.125
I took it anyway,
to show-and-tell.

20:47.208 --> 20:50.000
Your parents
never knew?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.583
I bragged
to my whole class about

20:51.667 --> 20:55.208
a...treasure chest
full of jewels.

20:56.959 --> 21:00.709
Gold and rubies.

21:00.792 --> 21:01.875
Who was there?

21:01.959 --> 21:05.792
All the kids,
the teacher, the assistant.

21:12.792 --> 21:16.208
Did I get my parents killed..

21:16.291 --> 21:18.000
...because of my lies?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.667
That was nice, detective.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.250
That was just what Kara
needs, more upset in her life.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.333
Well, you're the one
who brought her into
homicide..

21:38.417 --> 21:39.542
...looking for the truth.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.959
The truth about
their murders..

21:42.041 --> 21:43.333
...not about hurtful
secrets that don't do

21:43.417 --> 21:45.333
no good airing
after all this
time.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.875
What were you doing
on that corner

21:46.959 --> 21:48.291
the night
they died, Booker?

21:48.375 --> 21:49.959
If you were clean
like you said?

21:50.041 --> 21:51.458
- Not dealing.
- Buying?

21:51.542 --> 21:54.709
It's got no relevance
to what happened to
them.

21:54.792 --> 21:56.208
Kara know you were
hooked on smack?

21:56.291 --> 21:57.834
- Nope.
- She know you were in prison?

21:57.917 --> 21:59.041
No.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.333
Girl needs a father
figure
to look up to.

22:02.583 --> 22:03.583
Not all girls.

22:03.667 --> 22:06.709
I see you ain't wearing
no wedding ring.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.041
Well, you know, I just
can't find the right
ex-con

22:09.125 --> 22:11.625
drug-dealing smack
addict
to settle down with.

22:11.709 --> 22:15.625
You got man issues,
don't you?

22:17.500 --> 22:19.792
I think you're the
one
with issues, Daryl.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.375
You're hiding something,
and I'm gonna find out
what.

22:22.458 --> 22:24.250
So back off..

22:24.333 --> 22:27.417
...and let
me
get back to
it.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.625
Yes, sir.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.583
(Lilly)
'New list of people
to check out.'

22:37.667 --> 22:39.083
Kara told
her first grade class

22:39.166 --> 22:40.875
her family had
a hidden
treasure.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.458
Well, Scotty's
got something,
too.

22:42.542 --> 22:45.458
Talked to this old-timer at
this Buddhist temple on
Cambria.

22:45.542 --> 22:46.792
He knew the Dhiets
back in Cambodia

22:46.875 --> 22:49.417
and they got a niece
living in Philly.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.041
- Get a name?
- Mei Dhiet.

22:51.125 --> 22:54.250
Well, she goes
by her married name,
Toan.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.667
Kara's aunt.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.291
(Will)
'Who looked me
in the eye and said'

22:57.375 --> 22:59.125
she didn't know
anyone named Dhiet.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.291
(John)
'Now, if Mei knew
that Kara's parents'

23:01.375 --> 23:03.417
got her relatives
killed,
then she must have.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.917
That gives her
one good motive for murder.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.083
You said you didn't know
the Dhiets, Mei.

23:18.166 --> 23:20.542
- I don't.
- Come on, Mei.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.250
We know they were
your aunt and uncle.

23:22.333 --> 23:23.959
(Will)
Kara's father
made a deal to save

23:24.041 --> 23:25.667
his family
by getting yours deported.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.375
Which led to them
being executed

23:27.458 --> 23:28.792
and you taking revenge.

23:28.875 --> 23:29.750
No.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.625
No? You just let
that slide?

23:31.709 --> 23:34.542
No big deal?

23:34.625 --> 23:36.750
Sen have no choice.

23:36.834 --> 23:39.458
He must protect his family.

23:39.542 --> 23:40.917
Kara.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.500
I don't blame him.

23:42.583 --> 23:43.917
Last time
we talked, Mei

23:44.000 --> 23:46.625
seemed you
really hated Channary.

23:46.709 --> 23:48.250
I did..

23:48.333 --> 23:49.834
...but not why you think.

23:59.917 --> 24:02.542
(Brad)
'I wish my wife
would bring me lunch like
that.'

24:02.625 --> 24:04.667
Sen's a lucky man.

24:04.750 --> 24:06.500
You are beautiful.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.500
We must be getting back.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.834
Sen's a bright guy.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.959
He is a great...architect.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.750
You know who I am, right?

24:14.834 --> 24:16.750
Who my friend
is at the INS?

24:16.834 --> 24:18.166
I know who you are.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.041
'Cause Sen's been
mouthing off lately.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.125
Complaining about
getting shortchanged

24:22.208 --> 24:23.208
'paycheck wise.'

24:23.291 --> 24:25.542
He work very hard for you.

24:25.625 --> 24:28.083
Well how about you make up
for Sen's misbehaving?

24:28.166 --> 24:30.291
What do you say about
a little cultural
exchange?

24:30.375 --> 24:32.125
No, thank you.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.041
You want to translate here,
'cause I don't think

24:34.125 --> 24:35.208
'Miss Saigon understands me.'

24:35.291 --> 24:38.417
I am from Cambodia,
Saigon is in Vietnam

24:38.500 --> 24:42.250
and I understand completely.

24:45.709 --> 24:47.583
Who the hell does
that
bitch think she is?

24:47.667 --> 24:49.792
You don't want her.
She crazy.

24:49.875 --> 24:51.750
She cut your thing off
when you're not looking.

24:51.834 --> 24:56.750
Well, guess that
just leaves me and you now.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.625
I think
Channary
upset Atwater

25:01.709 --> 25:05.166
maybe get family deported.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.542
So I pay price for her.

25:07.625 --> 25:10.583
What'd you have to do?

25:10.667 --> 25:13.750
That man, Atwater..

25:13.834 --> 25:15.041
...evil.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.625
Evil how?

25:18.959 --> 25:22.208
Make me do things.

25:23.375 --> 25:25.041
Sex things.

25:25.125 --> 25:28.750
Lick his boots.

25:30.166 --> 25:32.625
That's why
I don't tell
police

25:32.709 --> 25:35.417
or my husband.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.417
I'm sorry, Mei.

25:36.500 --> 25:40.083
Is too late for sorry.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.250
(Robert)
Nothing decent has been written

25:43.333 --> 25:45.291
<i>the poetics.</i>

25:45.375 --> 25:47.709
You trust me,
Aristotle's the bomb.

25:47.792 --> 25:50.000
- Robert Richter.
- Yes?

25:50.083 --> 25:51.291
You were
a teacher's assistant

25:51.375 --> 25:54.125
at Adams Elementary
in 1991?

25:54.208 --> 25:57.125
To be continued.

25:58.166 --> 25:59.875
Adams Elementary
was a long time
ago.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.834
You had a student
named Kara Dhiet?

26:02.917 --> 26:05.125
Uh..

26:05.208 --> 26:06.834
...maybe.
I-I can't
remember.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.125
Well, she remembers you.

26:08.208 --> 26:10.375
And she's not
the only one.

26:10.458 --> 26:11.625
Know this guy?

26:11.709 --> 26:14.542
- Dolla Bill Whiting.
- Why would I know him?

26:14.625 --> 26:15.792
From when
you were a part-time

26:15.875 --> 26:17.667
assistant teacher
full-time crack head.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.458
(Lilly)
'He ID'd you as
the man who traded'

26:19.542 --> 26:21.625
a gold bracelet
for some rock.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.083
I knew this would come back
to haunt me one day.

26:26.166 --> 26:27.291
I just knew it.

26:27.375 --> 26:29.333
Yeah, well...boo.

26:29.417 --> 26:31.625
Well,
hy-hypothetically,
there's..

26:31.709 --> 26:32.917
...there's a
statute
of limitations

26:33.000 --> 26:34.208
on breaking and
entering, right?

26:34.291 --> 26:36.542
- Just not on murder.
- Mu...wait.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.000
What the hell
do you think I
did?

26:38.083 --> 26:39.792
Why don't you tell us.

26:39.875 --> 26:42.875
- Well, the kid...Karen.
- Kara.

26:42.959 --> 26:44.875
Whatever. The one
with
the fine looking
mother.

26:44.959 --> 26:46.333
Wait, so you knew Channary?

26:46.417 --> 26:48.500
Yeah, from-from
parent teacher
conferences.

26:48.583 --> 26:49.542
Hottie.

26:50.917 --> 26:53.667
Anyway the,
um...the kid kept
jawing

26:53.750 --> 26:54.834
on and on all the time about

26:54.917 --> 26:56.125
all these jewels they had.

26:56.208 --> 26:57.917
And you with a crack habit
to support..

26:58.000 --> 26:59.208
Broke into their place.

26:59.291 --> 27:00.917
Busted through
a kitchen
window.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.333
But I didn't find squat.

27:02.417 --> 27:03.583
Except for
that
bracelet.

27:03.667 --> 27:04.667
How about
the part when the family

27:04.750 --> 27:05.834
comes home
and you shoot them?

27:05.917 --> 27:07.375
There was no one home.
I swear.

27:07.458 --> 27:08.875
We better
take this guy in.

27:08.959 --> 27:10.333
(Robert)
N-no, wait-wait,
listen, l-listen.

27:10.417 --> 27:12.625
You...you want
a good lead? I got
one.

27:12.709 --> 27:14.041
This is good 411.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.041
We're listening.

27:16.125 --> 27:18.166
There was this guy
nobody messed with.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.709
The last stop
of the night

27:19.792 --> 27:22.291
I was just
jonesin'
to get a high
on.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.000
I saw them together.

27:25.709 --> 27:28.041
What's up B?
Got any rock for
me?

27:28.125 --> 27:30.667
You're already living
on credit.

27:51.583 --> 27:54.750
It's a far cry from
the opium dens in Saigon.

27:54.834 --> 27:57.917
From Phnom Pen, too.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.000
Mm.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.917
Now we become ghosts

28:07.000 --> 28:09.208
and forget.

28:10.166 --> 28:13.208
For a while anyway.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.041
Never expected to see
a babe like Channary

28:19.125 --> 28:21.625
in a crib like that.

28:21.709 --> 28:24.166
You're sure it was
Daryl Booker with Channary?

28:24.250 --> 28:26.041
You ever met Booker?

28:26.125 --> 28:27.417
Then you know.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.250
Man leaves an impression.

28:35.875 --> 28:36.792
(Scotty)
Well, Richter said he busted

28:36.875 --> 28:38.375
a kitchen window to get in.

28:38.458 --> 28:41.250
- Check it out.
- Already boarded up.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.875
Yeah, it's tough for a dead
couple to do house repairs.

28:43.959 --> 28:45.625
The search
on Atwater's running
dry.

28:45.709 --> 28:47.625
No priors,
no registered
weapons.

28:47.709 --> 28:49.291
Still checking
phone records.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.667
(Scotty)
Yeah, well, we know
what he did to Mei.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.333
Let's bring the
sumbitch
in and sweat him.

28:52.417 --> 28:54.625
(Nick)
Can't. He already lawyered up.

28:54.709 --> 28:56.166
- Lil?
- What's up?

28:56.250 --> 28:57.542
A friend of mine at the VA

28:57.625 --> 29:00.417
got a hold of Booker's
classified military
records.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.750
Classified? Was he
special ops or
something?

29:02.834 --> 29:04.959
No, he was a grunt just
like me, except his luck

29:05.041 --> 29:07.041
was worse,
he served in Tiger Company

29:07.125 --> 29:08.083
Quang Ngai Province.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.291
Mm...meaning?

29:09.375 --> 29:10.834
Well, a lot of those guys,
including Booker

29:10.917 --> 29:11.917
were brought up on charges.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.041
What'd they do?

29:13.125 --> 29:14.750
Allegedly,
massacred the locals

29:14.834 --> 29:17.041
execution style.

29:18.125 --> 29:19.959
Like Channary.

29:20.041 --> 29:21.291
Now, Booker beat
the court-marshal

29:21.375 --> 29:23.041
and was dishonorably
discharged instead

29:23.125 --> 29:24.208
for psychiatric reasons.

29:24.291 --> 29:25.542
He snapped?

29:25.625 --> 29:27.166
Lot of guys snapped,
lot of guys
recovered..

29:27.250 --> 29:30.166
Lil, I don't know
where he came out.

29:33.625 --> 29:36.333
Had to drag my ass
in here, didn't
you?

29:36.417 --> 29:37.667
Show me you the man.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.500
I knew you were
hiding
something, Booker.

29:39.583 --> 29:41.834
'Eyewitness saw you
smoking opium with Channary'

29:41.917 --> 29:45.542
who you said...you didn't know.

29:45.625 --> 29:46.917
So I knew her.
Big deal.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.542
No big deal.
Why lie?

29:48.625 --> 29:51.333
I got a theory about you,
why you got it in for m--

29:51.417 --> 29:52.417
Answer the question.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.625
It's 'cause
I did for Kara

29:53.709 --> 29:55.333
what no man
ever did for you.

29:55.417 --> 29:57.041
You mean lie to her?

29:57.125 --> 29:58.375
Pretend you're something
you're not?

29:58.458 --> 30:01.000
Take an interest in her.

30:02.417 --> 30:04.917
You didn't have
no father, did you?

30:09.875 --> 30:11.875
You know, I got a theory
about you, too, Daryl.

30:11.959 --> 30:13.959
I think that massacre
you did in Vietnam

30:14.041 --> 30:15.125
got under your skin.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.083
You don't know
nothing about
that.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.709
I've seen
pictures...of Channary.

30:19.792 --> 30:22.500
She...was beautiful.

30:22.583 --> 30:23.959
Yes, she was.

30:24.041 --> 30:25.166
You tried
to get her to leave Sen

30:25.250 --> 30:26.750
but she wouldn't,
so you snapped

30:26.834 --> 30:27.959
killed them
both in a rage

30:28.041 --> 30:30.250
then adopted Kara
'cause you felt guilty.

30:30.333 --> 30:31.250
No!

30:31.333 --> 30:32.250
You were on that corner
that night

30:32.333 --> 30:33.667
buying for her,
weren't you?

30:33.750 --> 30:36.500
- Channary was in agony.
- So you helped her?

30:36.583 --> 30:38.625
With opium?

30:38.709 --> 30:41.542
On the outside,
she was at peace,
serene.

30:41.625 --> 30:42.917
Inside, she was dying.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.959
Answer the question.

30:44.041 --> 30:46.750
Yes, I was
buying for
her.

30:46.834 --> 30:49.583
But the fool
that was selling was
late.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.000
Past 10:30,
past the
time

30:52.083 --> 30:54.291
those shots
were fired.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.709
- This fool have a name?
- Name and address.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.208
He'll tell you.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.083
So you've had
an alibi all this
time?

31:02.166 --> 31:03.375
You think
I want Kara
knowing

31:03.458 --> 31:05.417
her mom was
an opium fiend?

31:05.500 --> 31:06.792
That she was like me?

31:06.875 --> 31:08.917
Like you?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
How?

31:10.083 --> 31:11.959
Damaged goods.

31:13.458 --> 31:16.542
You were in love
with her, weren't you?

31:16.625 --> 31:19.166
First time we met..

31:19.250 --> 31:20.959
...I knew we shared
a mutual interest

31:21.041 --> 31:22.375
in forgetting about the past.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.625
You're here
all

31:40.709 --> 31:43.792
<i>New Testament</i>
once
long time ago.

31:43.875 --> 31:44.959
I'm trying
to figure out how

31:45.041 --> 31:46.875
to live in this country.

31:46.959 --> 31:50.125
I thought this would be
a good place to start.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.959
a

31:53.041 --> 31:54.959
Where you from?

31:55.041 --> 31:56.125
Cambodia.

31:56.208 --> 31:57.750
Phnom Pen.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.458
I was there once.

31:59.542 --> 32:00.917
Past life.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.417
During the war?

32:03.500 --> 32:05.000
Not supposed
to talk about that.

32:05.083 --> 32:08.417
Ah, yes. Secrets.

32:19.542 --> 32:22.291
Did you ever smoke opium..

32:22.375 --> 32:25.333
...in Southeast Asia?

32:25.417 --> 32:26.750
Yeah. Why?

32:26.834 --> 32:30.041
I don't know anyone here..

32:30.125 --> 32:31.709
...and I need to forget.

32:31.792 --> 32:33.875
Forget what?

32:34.917 --> 32:37.417
My secret.

32:38.208 --> 32:40.000
You hate it here?

32:40.083 --> 32:42.208
Did you hate Vietnam?

32:45.083 --> 32:46.458
My name is Daryl.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.166
Channary.

32:48.250 --> 32:51.583
But my real name
is Kannitha.

32:55.792 --> 32:57.917
Why not tell Kara
you loved her mother?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.417
Can't...without her
finding out

33:00.500 --> 33:03.250
how...busted up
her mom was inside.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.667
- 'She don't need to know
that.'
- Maybe not.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.959
Children don't want to know
who their parents really
are..

33:09.041 --> 33:12.208
...just who
they want them to be.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.667
You don't believe
in the truth?

33:14.750 --> 33:17.959
Not if it hurts
more than it
helps.

33:19.125 --> 33:21.959
You're not gonna
tell Kara, are
you?

33:30.875 --> 33:32.041
You okay, Daryl?

33:32.125 --> 33:34.750
Oh, s-s-sure, I am!

33:34.834 --> 33:36.041
What are you doing here?

33:36.125 --> 33:37.583
My aunt saw them
bringing you in.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.333
Why are you
bothering him?

33:39.417 --> 33:41.834
He'd never do
anything to hurt me.

33:41.917 --> 33:43.208
She's just
doing her job, sweetheart.

33:43.291 --> 33:45.250
How could you think
Daryl killed my parents?

33:45.333 --> 33:47.542
He didn't even know them.

33:51.834 --> 33:53.417
I made a mistake.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.625
You should arrest
that psycho Atwater.

33:55.709 --> 33:56.750
Brad Atwater?

33:56.834 --> 33:58.417
Sen's boss?

33:58.500 --> 34:01.208
I heard my aunt tell
my uncle what he made her do.

34:01.291 --> 34:04.917
Get on her knees,
lick his boots.

34:05.000 --> 34:05.875
That true?

34:05.959 --> 34:07.458
We're looking into it.

34:07.542 --> 34:08.959
(Kara)
'I always thought
my aunt was so cold'

34:09.041 --> 34:11.000
but she did that
for my parents.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.625
For me.

34:14.125 --> 34:16.709
That guy
should be shot.

34:17.667 --> 34:19.000
Take her home?

34:19.083 --> 34:20.000
Come on.

34:20.083 --> 34:23.792
Let's get outta here.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.375
- Still here, huh?
- Yeah.

34:34.458 --> 34:36.583
I, uh..

34:36.667 --> 34:38.792
...had to write up
my Booker
interview.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.375
Guy didn't do it, huh?

34:40.458 --> 34:44.083
I was wrong about him.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.208
Took him
for a lech after
predator

34:46.291 --> 34:48.250
or...something worse.

34:49.875 --> 34:51.166
Well, being cynical is a hazard

34:51.250 --> 34:53.333
'of the job, Lil.'

34:53.417 --> 34:56.000
Jeffries got Atwater's
phone records back.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.166
And?

34:57.250 --> 34:59.834
Six calls logged
from Atwater's house

34:59.917 --> 35:01.250
to Sen and Channary's

35:01.333 --> 35:03.000
all within the week

35:03.083 --> 35:04.500
'before the murder.'

35:04.583 --> 35:06.583
That's something.

35:24.959 --> 35:27.542
(Daryl)
He shot 'em.
Both of 'em.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.542
Put that gun down.

35:30.625 --> 35:32.875
Boots is how
I know he did it.

35:32.959 --> 35:34.041
'Never could figure out'

35:34.125 --> 35:36.291
how Channary got
that dirt on her mouth..

35:36.375 --> 35:37.709
...till I found
out you liked

35:37.792 --> 35:39.250
women licking your heels.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.083
Don't do it, Daryl!
Man's not worth it.

35:41.166 --> 35:42.542
(Daryl)
'I killed plenty of
people.'

35:42.625 --> 35:44.041
One more won't matter.

35:44.125 --> 35:47.291
Now, you know
that's not true.

35:48.792 --> 35:51.792
You got a ghost rattling
around
behind your eyelids like me?

35:51.875 --> 35:53.583
I was there.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.458
Kill anyone?

35:55.542 --> 35:57.208
Yeah..

35:57.291 --> 35:58.625
'...when I was 18, Daryl.'

35:58.709 --> 36:00.250
When I didn't
think like a man.

36:00.333 --> 36:03.458
But you and me,
we're not 18 now.

36:03.542 --> 36:06.125
But Kara is.

36:06.208 --> 36:10.125
And every girl needs
a father figure, like you
said.

36:10.208 --> 36:12.291
Tell me you can
nail this
bastard.

36:12.375 --> 36:13.583
We got phone records.

36:13.667 --> 36:16.083
Ties him to Channary
before the murders.

36:16.166 --> 36:17.041
That's crap.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.208
I never called that woman.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.333
- I did.
- What?

36:22.417 --> 36:24.250
I called her,
to hear the
voice

36:24.333 --> 36:26.083
of the woman
who was driving you
crazy.

36:26.166 --> 36:28.583
Oh, lord.
Pharmacy speaking.

36:28.667 --> 36:30.166
She was the one
you couldn't
have.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.583
You know how many pills
she's on for this
fibromyalgia?

36:32.667 --> 36:35.250
Was he really fixing
potholes that night, Brenda?

36:35.333 --> 36:36.458
Yes.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.000
- But then he went out--
- Shut up, Bren.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.667
And when he came back..

36:40.750 --> 36:42.583
...he buried
something in the
driveway

36:42.667 --> 36:44.083
'in one of the potholes.'

36:44.166 --> 36:45.250
The gun.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.917
You think they're
gonna believe a whack job

36:47.000 --> 36:49.542
like you with
your made-up disease?

36:50.542 --> 36:51.750
You got what you need?

36:51.834 --> 36:52.959
Yeah.

36:53.041 --> 36:55.166
We got it.

36:58.333 --> 37:00.917
Talk about
Channary, Brad.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.542
(John)
What happened that night?

37:03.625 --> 37:05.083
(Atwater)
'Woman was uppity.'

37:06.083 --> 37:08.458
Acted too good for me.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.125
So you went
to teach her what's what.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.959
(Atwater)
'That morning,
she came to the site.'

37:12.041 --> 37:15.083
Brought Sen
his lunch as always.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.375
I say hello.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.792
She doesn't even
acknowledge me.

37:18.875 --> 37:23.000
So, Sen was just a casualty
that night, huh?

37:24.250 --> 37:25.709
She was the one.

37:34.792 --> 37:36.083
Who is it?

37:36.166 --> 37:39.917
(Atwater)
'Brad Atwater. Your boss.'

37:43.542 --> 37:46.709
Mr. Atwater
what can I do for
you?

37:47.750 --> 37:50.583
Ask your wife, she knows.

37:50.667 --> 37:54.000
He wants me
to be with
him.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.291
Must be a mistake.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.083
No mistake.

37:57.166 --> 37:58.125
Hands and knees.

38:02.375 --> 38:05.333
Hands and knees
or he dies.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.500
You think I'm fooling?

38:11.250 --> 38:16.375
First, lick the boots,
then move on up.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.250
Ah!

38:40.291 --> 38:43.166
Oh...God!

38:43.250 --> 38:47.041
- No.
- Look, what you made me do!

38:50.625 --> 38:53.875
Now, I gotta kill you, too.

38:57.625 --> 39:01.458
Ain't you even gonna beg?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.875
You don't exist.
