Man, Leonardo
sure looks awful.

01:17.434 --> 01:19.871
Ok, i think we found
the solution

01:19.872 --> 01:21.207
to your
hyper-mutation.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.342
now, stand back,
guys.

01:22.343 --> 01:23.945
i'm gonna
test it out.

01:37.137 --> 01:38.038
uhh.

01:38.039 --> 01:39.206
hey...

01:39.207 --> 01:41.544
what am i doing
in a cage ?

01:41.545 --> 01:43.247
you were auditioning
for the lead role

01:43.248 --> 01:44.650
in the next
jurassic movie

01:44.651 --> 01:45.785
as a turtlesaurus rex.

01:45.786 --> 01:47.121
how do you feel ?

01:47.122 --> 01:49.459
fine. now can you
let me out of here ?

01:49.460 --> 01:52.030
well, your vital signs
are all ok.

01:52.031 --> 01:54.368
ahh. thanks for
all your help, guys.

01:54.369 --> 01:56.672
it's good
to be normal again.

01:56.673 --> 02:00.345
The genetic code
in this mutated turtle shell

02:00.346 --> 02:03.484
contains the key
to my defeating the turtles.

02:03.485 --> 02:05.020
with the mutanite,

02:05.021 --> 02:08.526
i will mutate them
out of existence.

02:10.098 --> 02:12.568
um, we don't quite
have the mutanite,

02:12.569 --> 02:15.506
as it is a very
rare element, lord Dregg,

02:15.507 --> 02:18.479
found only
in, uh, dimension x.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.083
i've had a patrol
out searching for months.

02:22.754 --> 02:25.459
what ? i don't
have months.

02:25.460 --> 02:29.265
i need mutanite now
or my plan won't work.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.802
eh, i--i--

02:31.803 --> 02:33.405
i know of another way.

02:36.546 --> 02:39.216
there is
an element on earth

02:39.217 --> 02:41.120
called plutonium.

02:42.524 --> 02:44.726
it not only
creates mutations,

02:44.727 --> 02:47.898
but can cause an atomic
explosion as well.

02:50.639 --> 02:53.976
excellent. this plutonium
is just what i need

02:53.977 --> 02:55.980
to rid myself of the turtles

02:55.981 --> 02:58.318
so i can finally conquer
the earth.

02:58.319 --> 03:00.589
but how exactly
do you plan

03:00.590 --> 03:02.759
to dispose
of the reptiles ?

03:02.760 --> 03:04.929
<i>i don't. </i>

03:04.930 --> 03:08.069
they'll dispose
of themselves.

03:08.070 --> 03:10.807
oh, no.
look at those feet.

03:10.808 --> 03:12.378
i'm glad
we can't smell them.

03:12.379 --> 03:14.380
i am pleased to see
your mutations

03:14.381 --> 03:16.517
have finally
been stabilized.

03:16.518 --> 03:18.522
ahh. looks like
i'm the only freak

03:18.523 --> 03:19.558
left in the circus.

03:19.559 --> 03:20.960
the happy butterfly

03:20.961 --> 03:24.299
does not spend its time
dreaming of caterpillars.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.438
unh. i feel sick.

03:27.439 --> 03:28.874
what a wuss,
Leonardo.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.444
i saw this movie
6 times

03:30.445 --> 03:31.879
before it made me
nauseous.

03:35.754 --> 03:36.755
grr !

03:36.756 --> 03:39.560
easy. easy,
Leonardo

03:39.561 --> 03:40.862
we're your friends,
remember ?

03:40.863 --> 03:43.033
rrahhr !

03:43.034 --> 03:44.135
whoa.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.704
why do i get
the feeling

03:45.705 --> 03:47.375
he thinks we're
turtle-burgers ?

03:52.117 --> 03:53.686
do not resist him.

03:54.822 --> 03:56.692
sensei, no.
get away from him.

04:01.134 --> 04:03.403
i didn't move.
i swear.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.517
we gotta stop him

04:10.518 --> 04:13.088
before he turns the city
into a junkyard again.

04:13.089 --> 04:14.859
i'll go with carter.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.467
look out !

04:41.742 --> 04:44.245
no need
to alarm anyone.

04:44.246 --> 04:46.550
i just want
your entire supply

04:46.551 --> 04:49.722
of plutonium...
now !

04:54.999 --> 04:55.933
uh-oh.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.208
guys, we've
picked up his trail

05:00.209 --> 05:01.510
on east valla boulevard.

05:03.415 --> 05:04.682
we're on our way.

05:12.932 --> 05:14.166
there he is.

05:14.167 --> 05:18.173
Leonardo, please come back
to the lair with us.

05:18.174 --> 05:20.177
rrahhr !

05:24.119 --> 05:24.853
unh.

05:28.027 --> 05:30.195
hey, you all right,
Donatello ?

05:30.196 --> 05:32.700
nothing a little
adjustment won't fix.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.237
ahh.

05:34.238 --> 05:35.239
hey, guys,

05:35.240 --> 05:37.375
does Leonardo
like hockey ?

05:37.376 --> 05:39.046
uh, not particularly.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.214
in that case,

05:40.215 --> 05:41.918
we're in trouble !

05:56.244 --> 05:59.383
ok, Michelangelo,
now !

06:01.688 --> 06:02.821
rrahhr !

06:03.891 --> 06:06.662
let's get him
back to the van.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.744
i feel like
a frozen tv dinner.

06:14.745 --> 06:17.550
i can't let you
cause any more damage.

06:47.606 --> 06:49.107
hey.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.877
ohh.
hey.

06:54.886 --> 06:56.287
look out !

07:03.334 --> 07:05.369
aah !

07:06.874 --> 07:08.375
we gotta stop Leonardo

07:08.376 --> 07:10.546
before he trashes
the whole stadium.

07:11.616 --> 07:12.751
all: whoa !

07:12.752 --> 07:14.453
i'm slipping.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.238
help !

07:28.648 --> 07:31.284
uh. good shot, dude,

07:31.285 --> 07:33.922
only i'm not a teenage
mutant hockey puck.

07:59.370 --> 08:00.772
you ok, carter ?

08:00.773 --> 08:02.141
ooh. i'll be fine

08:02.142 --> 08:04.279
once we get Leonardo
back to normal.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.947
come on !

08:16.201 --> 08:18.204
wow, the internet
is great

08:18.205 --> 08:20.140
for researching stories.

08:20.141 --> 08:21.510
<i>i'm here live</i>

08:21.511 --> 08:23.714
<i>from the metropolitan
hockey stadium. </i>

08:23.715 --> 08:25.650
<i>once again,
one of the notorious</i>

08:25.651 --> 08:28.356
<i>mutant ninja turtles
is reeking havoc. </i>

08:28.357 --> 08:30.827
<i>this time in the middle
of the hockey playoffs. </i>

08:30.828 --> 08:33.164
oh, those guys
have more energy

08:33.164 --> 08:36.003
than that
battery-powered rabbit.

08:36.004 --> 08:38.039
but from now on
i'm working

08:38.041 --> 08:40.812
on nice
ordinary stories.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.849
and this is just what
i've been looking for--

08:42.850 --> 08:44.351
to crack the biggest

08:44.352 --> 08:45.988
chop-shop ring
in the city !

08:45.989 --> 08:47.190
"otto wrecker,

08:47.191 --> 08:48.725
"known car thief,

08:48.726 --> 08:51.799
disappeared
2 years ago. "

08:51.800 --> 08:53.769
now to analyze
all the car thefts

08:53.770 --> 08:56.140
over the past 3 weeks.

08:56.141 --> 08:58.109
and that's where
the computer predicts

08:58.110 --> 08:59.746
otto will strike next !

09:08.664 --> 09:09.597
rrahhr !

09:12.037 --> 09:13.938
he's heading
for the bridge.

09:13.939 --> 09:15.809
cut him off
on the north side,

09:15.810 --> 09:16.944
we'll cover the south.

09:24.794 --> 09:26.796
rrahhr !

09:28.099 --> 09:29.735
easy, Leonardo.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.005
nobody's gonna
hurt you.

09:33.409 --> 09:35.712
rrahhr !

09:37.683 --> 09:40.454
It's one of
Dregg's shuttles !

09:55.782 --> 09:57.719
he's got Leonardo !

09:57.720 --> 09:59.322
well, what are we
standing around for ?

09:59.323 --> 10:00.457
wait.

10:02.462 --> 10:04.164
that train will crash
if it reaches the bridge.

10:04.165 --> 10:05.433
we got to stop it.

10:05.434 --> 10:06.902
but what about
Leonardo ?

10:06.903 --> 10:08.339
i'll go after him.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.807
you guys take care
of the train.

10:20.295 --> 10:23.199
there's a switch
about 100 yards back.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.969
see if you can
change the tracks.

10:24.970 --> 10:26.572
i'll try to signal
the train.

10:28.677 --> 10:30.045
uhh !

10:30.046 --> 10:31.814
man, it was
never this hard

10:31.815 --> 10:33.184
on my electric
train set.

10:35.857 --> 10:38.226
yeow !

10:38.227 --> 10:39.829
It's too late, carter.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.231
get off the tracks !

10:41.232 --> 10:42.534
no !

10:42.535 --> 10:43.736
Carter !

10:53.421 --> 10:55.859
that was the bravest
thing i ever saw !

10:55.860 --> 10:57.595
that dude
sacrificed himself

10:57.596 --> 10:59.131
to save the train !

11:00.735 --> 11:02.738
guys, could you
help me ?

11:02.739 --> 11:04.408
he's still alive !

11:08.015 --> 11:08.882
thanks.

11:08.883 --> 11:10.017
don't mention it.

11:10.018 --> 11:11.921
and don't scare us
like that again !

11:11.922 --> 11:13.123
hey, guys,

11:13.124 --> 11:15.093
how are we gonna locate
Dregg's shuttle ?

11:15.094 --> 11:18.132
come on ! we can track it
from the van !

11:20.372 --> 11:22.374
carter:
he's headed northeast.

11:22.375 --> 11:23.609
well, let's boogie !

11:32.227 --> 11:34.529
titanium, aluminum,

11:34.530 --> 11:37.468
chromium, benzene.

11:37.469 --> 11:38.938
perfect.

11:38.939 --> 11:41.208
the microbots will have
everything they need

11:41.209 --> 11:45.348
to rebuild that warehouse
to my specifications.

11:45.349 --> 11:47.352
with those
kinds of chemicals

11:47.353 --> 11:48.955
and Dregg's kind
of mind,

11:48.956 --> 11:52.528
10 to 1 he's gonna
build something bad.

12:25.891 --> 12:27.894
this is going
to be a nice,

12:27.895 --> 12:29.965
easy,
turtle-free story.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.472
hey !

12:34.473 --> 12:35.976
what ?!

12:35.977 --> 12:37.979
oh, talk about bad luck.

12:37.980 --> 12:41.351
i'm in the middle of another
one of Dregg's evil plots.

12:43.456 --> 12:45.458
he's got Leonardo.

12:45.459 --> 12:46.862
i've got to alert
the others.

12:49.969 --> 12:53.440
time to go to work,
my little friends.

12:53.441 --> 12:55.845
build me
a plutonium ray.

12:55.846 --> 12:58.549
and when they're done,
i'll transform you

12:58.550 --> 13:01.455
into the deadliest turtle
in the world.

13:13.412 --> 13:15.314
i've lost
the shuttle.

13:15.315 --> 13:17.418
guys, it's April.
Dregg's got Leonardo !

13:17.419 --> 13:20.457
we're in a warehouse
at 333 south sim--

13:20.458 --> 13:21.726
aah !

13:25.334 --> 13:28.170
we've gotta find
April, and fast.

13:28.171 --> 13:29.440
but she never got
a chance

13:29.441 --> 13:30.842
to give us
the entire address.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.412
no problemo, dude.

13:32.413 --> 13:34.682
i'll just let my turtle
fingers do the walking

13:34.683 --> 13:36.753
through the web pages.

13:36.754 --> 13:39.291
uh-oh,
major problemo, dude.

13:39.292 --> 13:40.660
there's 2 addresses

13:40.661 --> 13:43.732
beginning with
333 south sim-something.

13:43.733 --> 13:44.935
there's "simpson street"

13:44.936 --> 13:46.705
and
"simpleton boulevard. "

13:46.706 --> 13:48.107
well, we'll have
to check them both.

14:01.933 --> 14:05.739
rrahhr !

14:05.740 --> 14:07.743
relax, turtle.

14:07.744 --> 14:10.247
you'll be dealt
with soon enough.

14:12.086 --> 14:14.088
now's my chance
to free Leonardo.

14:16.761 --> 14:18.764
lord Dregg ?

14:18.765 --> 14:21.034
here's the plutonium
you required.

14:24.541 --> 14:27.279
Everything is ready.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.185
no ! that plutonium
will destroy him !

14:33.624 --> 14:36.729
rrahhr !

14:39.268 --> 14:41.538
stop !
he'll never survive !

14:41.539 --> 14:43.876
don't worry.
it won't be fatal.

14:43.877 --> 14:46.246
heh heh.
at least not yet.

14:53.561 --> 14:55.263
huh ?

14:56.567 --> 14:57.600
huh ?

14:57.601 --> 14:59.571
Leonardo,
are you ok ?

14:59.572 --> 15:02.510
huh. actually...

15:02.511 --> 15:04.580
i feel great.

15:04.581 --> 15:06.617
why did you
cure me ?

15:06.618 --> 15:08.087
cure you ? ha !

15:08.088 --> 15:09.924
think again, fool.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.068
all right, dudes,

15:16.069 --> 15:18.104
let's kick some bat !

15:18.105 --> 15:20.109
hyah !
hyah !

15:21.881 --> 15:24.116
what would Dregg be doing
in an animal warehouse ?

15:24.117 --> 15:25.920
maybe he knows santa's
not gonna give him

15:25.921 --> 15:27.589
that puppy he asked for.

15:30.796 --> 15:31.797
over there !

15:33.400 --> 15:35.403
hyah !
hyah !

15:35.404 --> 15:36.773
grrrr !

15:36.774 --> 15:38.577
rraaar !

15:38.578 --> 15:40.947
either Dregg needs
a shave...

15:40.948 --> 15:43.752
or we're in
the wrong warehouse !

15:45.656 --> 15:47.158
let April go, Dregg !

15:47.159 --> 15:49.161
there's no reason
to keep her here.

15:49.162 --> 15:50.363
you're right.

15:50.364 --> 15:51.766
Mung, release her.

15:54.773 --> 15:56.542
go on, April,
get out of here.

15:56.543 --> 15:59.048
i said i was
releasing her.

15:59.049 --> 16:01.719
i never said anything
about letting her go.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.160
Mung, have the microbots
turn her into a cyborg.

16:06.161 --> 16:08.163
no !

16:08.164 --> 16:09.565
freeze, beetle-brain !

16:14.978 --> 16:16.312
Destroy them !

16:28.569 --> 16:31.741
Mung, use
the plutonium ray.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.610
guys, look out !

16:37.351 --> 16:39.254
i brought your blades,
Leonardo.

16:42.495 --> 16:44.330
thanks, Raphael.

16:44.331 --> 16:46.167
the game's over, Dregg !

16:46.168 --> 16:48.504
on the contrary,
turtle.

16:48.505 --> 16:50.274
it's just beginning.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.610
at this very moment,

16:51.611 --> 16:53.680
the plutonium
in your system

16:53.681 --> 16:55.584
is turning
your mutated genes

16:55.585 --> 16:58.923
into a very unstable
element.

16:58.924 --> 17:01.194
Dregg, you're not
trying to tell us

17:01.195 --> 17:04.200
that he's gonna reach
critical mass ?!

17:04.201 --> 17:05.635
exactly.

17:05.636 --> 17:07.539
that means Leonardo
is gonna go nuclear

17:07.540 --> 17:09.209
in less
than 30 minutes !

17:09.210 --> 17:11.213
he'll take the whole
city with him !

17:11.214 --> 17:13.684
he's bluffing !
i don't feel a--

17:13.685 --> 17:17.021
uh, i don't feel
very good.

17:18.394 --> 17:19.595
nothing personal,

17:19.596 --> 17:21.897
but you don't look
very good either.

17:21.898 --> 17:23.602
raaaaah !

17:23.603 --> 17:25.705
boy ! i said
it wasn't personal.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.353
raaaah !

17:49.016 --> 17:50.017
grrr.

17:51.086 --> 17:53.289
come on ! we gotta
get out of here !

17:57.231 --> 17:59.234
oh !

17:59.235 --> 18:01.037
let her go,
Leonardo !

18:02.040 --> 18:05.712
Leonardo,
please put me down !

18:05.713 --> 18:07.749
help !

18:10.121 --> 18:11.889
how are we gonna
stop Leonardo

18:11.890 --> 18:13.727
before the big bang ?

18:13.728 --> 18:15.363
well, if we can get
the chemicals

18:15.364 --> 18:17.334
Dregg used
on Leonardo...

18:17.335 --> 18:18.168
we can diffuse them

18:18.169 --> 18:19.805
and possibly stabilize
his mutation !

18:19.806 --> 18:22.076
all right !
we're happening now !

18:22.077 --> 18:23.579
let's have
the chemicals.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.381
uh, they're in
Dregg's shuttle.

18:25.382 --> 18:27.385
we're not happening.

18:27.386 --> 18:29.289
Donatello and i
will go after Leonardo.

18:29.290 --> 18:31.559
you guys try to get
Dregg's chemistry set.

18:31.560 --> 18:32.294
right !

18:37.237 --> 18:38.739
Dregg's shuttle
is up ahead.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.576
see if you can get
underneath it.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.345
oh, yeah. piece of cake.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.491
whoo-hoo !

18:49.492 --> 18:51.229
caught a big one, dude !

18:58.643 --> 19:00.045
unh. oomph.

19:00.046 --> 19:02.082
<i>you sure they didn't
catch us ?</i>

19:04.221 --> 19:05.221
there he is !

19:05.222 --> 19:06.223
look out !

19:06.224 --> 19:07.726
aah !

19:07.727 --> 19:09.062
rrrraaaah !

19:09.063 --> 19:10.063
look out !

19:10.064 --> 19:11.299
monster !

19:17.077 --> 19:18.311
he's going crazy !

19:18.312 --> 19:19.313
carter, stop !

19:25.425 --> 19:27.596
uh, we need to borrow
your truck.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.332
it's a national
emergency.

19:32.739 --> 19:33.740
run !

19:33.741 --> 19:34.742
aah !

19:42.490 --> 19:44.393
Higher.

19:44.394 --> 19:45.695
April !

19:47.866 --> 19:49.368
rrraaah !
jump !

19:52.709 --> 19:54.712
ecch !
this stinks.

19:54.713 --> 19:56.815
i need some air.

19:56.816 --> 19:58.318
no, don't touch that !

20:04.330 --> 20:05.832
whoa !

20:05.833 --> 20:07.568
oh !

20:11.410 --> 20:14.347
carter, get us back
to the lair fast !

20:31.012 --> 20:32.948
Raphael,
get the chemicals !

20:34.319 --> 20:36.087
oh, man !
i hope these are the ones

20:36.088 --> 20:37.456
Donatello
was talking about.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.234
cowabunga !

20:43.235 --> 20:45.638
you won't get away,
turtles !

20:49.313 --> 20:51.749
whaaah !
whoa !

20:56.359 --> 20:59.497
no-o-o-o !

21:14.893 --> 21:16.629
he's about
to go critical !

21:16.630 --> 21:19.467
if Michelangelo and Raphael
don't get here soon,

21:19.468 --> 21:21.804
this place is gonna be
a turtle crater.

21:21.805 --> 21:24.710
oh, yeah.
we got 'em.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.053
well, here goes.

21:40.773 --> 21:41.774
ohh.

21:41.775 --> 21:43.277
oh, man.

21:43.278 --> 21:46.449
i gotta cut out those
cheesy sci-fi flicks.

21:46.450 --> 21:48.821
i just had
one weird dream.

21:48.822 --> 21:49.956
hey !
all right !

21:49.957 --> 21:51.726
welcome back,
dude !

21:57.638 --> 22:00.341
the picture
from the remote microbot

22:00.342 --> 22:03.213
we placed on the reptile
is coming in now.

22:03.214 --> 22:05.751
they've returned
the mutated one

22:05.752 --> 22:07.688
to normal, lord Dregg.

22:07.689 --> 22:09.090
he may look normal,

22:09.091 --> 22:12.531
but i've permanently altered
his genetic structure,

22:12.532 --> 22:16.972
and, soon, i'll put it
to my advantage.

22:18.375 --> 22:20.512
your transformation
is stable, Leonardo.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.416
no more
wild mutations.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.753
ha ha.
i can't believe it.

22:24.754 --> 22:26.857
i'm a normal mutant
again.

22:26.858 --> 22:28.159
isn't it great,
carter ?

22:28.160 --> 22:30.329
huh. yeah, sure.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.971
hey, hang in there,
carter.

22:34.972 --> 22:37.009
if my calculations
are correct,

22:37.010 --> 22:39.413
we may be able to
eliminate your mutation

22:39.414 --> 22:41.382
with a similar
combination of elements.

22:41.383 --> 22:43.553
yeah, well,
i'm not sure i'd want

22:43.554 --> 22:46.459
to return to normal,
even if i could.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.296
maybe the only thing
that makes me special

22:48.297 --> 22:49.564
is my mutation.

22:49.565 --> 22:50.967
it is not your mutation

22:50.968 --> 22:53.238
that makes you
special, carter.

22:53.239 --> 22:56.411
it is you who make
your mutation special.

22:56.412 --> 22:59.015
whoa, sensei,
that's deep.

22:59.016 --> 23:00.986
too deep for me.
