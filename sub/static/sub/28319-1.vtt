00:43.137 --> 00:48.345
Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1995

01:06.359 --> 01:08.592
Are everyone in positions?

01:08.672 --> 01:10.672
Slash: yes.

01:10.887 --> 01:12.519
Vera: yes.

01:12.619 --> 01:14.619
Gerey: yes.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.637
Barry: yes.

01:16.737 --> 01:18.817
Kiriah: yes.

01:20.415 --> 01:23.845
So, the band - we sit quietly, we're waiting for a command.

01:34.881 --> 01:39.697
Find fire on the second point! Act according to the situation!

01:41.332 --> 01:44.536
Well, in such silence I want to overturn everything.

01:44.636 --> 01:48.528
Shatiya, an excellent point, to cover your asses.

02:03.493 --> 02:06.063
Commander, they hurt me ...

02:08.925 --> 02:12.833
Slash, is this a lighter? - No.

02:13.123 --> 02:15.177
Throw the cigarette!

02:15.257 --> 02:17.194
You remove both and capture Harun.

02:17.274 --> 02:19.816
Slash, he needs us alive.

02:19.896 --> 02:22.835
Piece of cake.

02:53.337 --> 02:58.692
Guys, somehow, it's very quiet here. I feel this is not good.

02:58.772 --> 03:01.966
Surah, when Slash grabs Harun, you conceal.

03:02.046 --> 03:04.537
Open your eyes and come on without whimpering.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.550
Listen without whining, Commander.

03:12.683 --> 03:16.714
Slash, Slash ... The commander's command is to catch him alive.

03:30.879 --> 03:33.857
Gerey, do you watch?

03:34.236 --> 03:37.981
So far, there is silence. - Do not lie. I see you sing!

03:40.428 --> 03:43.583
Now you 'll "sing, dirty!

03:43.978 --> 03:46.275
How did this happen?

03:46.355 --> 03:50.624
Slash, tell Sylvia ... "" Hang on! Hang on, brother!

03:52.261 --> 03:54.568
Commander, Kiru is badly injured!

03:54.668 --> 03:56.697
Emergency evacuation ...

03:56.777 --> 03:58.781
Hang on, brother!

04:08.219 --> 04:12.755
Barra, is everything ready for you? "That's right, Commander, everything is ready!"

04:13.135 --> 04:15.135
We'll "stretch" you, darling.

04:22.698 --> 04:25.394
Now you're going to fly, pederast!

04:54.606 --> 04:56.637
There were already waiting for us.

04:56.717 --> 05:00.358
Kiru lost much blood, probably will not get alive.

05:01.066 --> 05:05.073
It's all right, brother-in-law ... It's all right.

05:07.216 --> 05:10.213
I want home ... "" What are you talking about, my friend? "

05:10.313 --> 05:13.745
I want home ... "" Do not get mad, can you hear me? "

05:13.845 --> 05:16.981
Soon we will fly. - I hope I'm alive ...

05:17.061 --> 05:20.034
Please ... give this to ...

05:22.194 --> 05:24.346
Masha ...

05:25.430 --> 05:29.254
Take care of Mom and Masha.

05:30.269 --> 05:32.980
When you arrive home, you will take care of yourself, understand?

05:40.087 --> 05:42.087
Kiriah ...

05:42.275 --> 05:44.580
Kiriah ...

05:46.910 --> 05:49.278
Киря !!!

06:05.115 --> 06:06.334
OK!

06:06.414 --> 06:08.735
Relax him! - Slash, sir.

06:08.835 --> 06:11.554
Tell him to stop! - He's under NATO's protection!

06:11.654 --> 06:15.524
It was me! I'm sorry. - Ile, leave it!

06:18.156 --> 06:21.674
Under what protection? - In short:

06:21.754 --> 06:25.841
There was an order to let this freak, but I could not get back to you anymore.

06:25.921 --> 06:29.978
How come we let him go? He's a war criminal! Beck, he killed Kirya!

06:30.058 --> 06:34.666
Do not make me a traitor! There was a warrant, that's it! We have no choice!

06:34.746 --> 06:37.194
Who in the order - NATO? - Yes! Finish!

06:37.274 --> 06:42.470
More relaxed! All of you here are subordinate to NATO, did you understand?

06:42.550 --> 06:45.630
This is our territory!

06:45.710 --> 06:48.673
If you kill him, you go to a military court!

06:48.808 --> 06:53.844
You will execute my commandments! Did you understand me, soldier?

06:57.840 --> 07:00.720
Urgently contact the base. Exceptional situation on board.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.778
Who's in charge here - you or he?

07:12.565 --> 07:16.506
What is going on here? - Lost in Translation!

07:16.606 --> 07:20.919
You will regret it! "Are you crazy?" Shatalov!

07:21.487 --> 07:25.150
Brief: Get a command for landing! - What?

07:29.855 --> 07:34.608
For the discretion of the officers' title, non-execution,

07:34.688 --> 07:39.400
failure of the assignment and threat to the international relations of the RF,

07:39.480 --> 07:41.710
to lay down the soldiers:

07:41.790 --> 07:45.387
Andrei Shatalov, Oleg Barmin, Vera Kurbaeva,

07:45.468 --> 07:48.717
Ilya Slashchev and Rustam Baba Gereev

07:48.817 --> 07:52.055
of the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

07:52.153 --> 07:56.591
Deputy Chief of Intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel Aslanbek Ithhoev,

07:56.671 --> 08:00.240
shall be declared incomplete official compliance.

08:02.369 --> 08:04.678
Listen, incomplete compliance.

08:04.758 --> 08:07.656
Beck, listen ... I'm telling you as a friend.

08:07.747 --> 08:12.369
"Up" are rabid. The situation is very fucking.

08:14.719 --> 08:19.746
If yours show up in Russia, even I will not be able to do anything.

08:31.612 --> 08:35.712
<i> By signing the Dayton Accords in 1995, the war in Bosnia ended </ i></i>

08:35.812 --> 08:39.402
<i> But peace in the Balkans did not last long. </ i></i>

08:46.664 --> 08:49.911
<i> A new conflict arose in the region in 1998 - Kosovo Albanians want independence. </ i></i>

<i> In 1999, without the consent of the UN Security Council, </ i></i>

09:05.404 --> 09:10.415

Belgrade, Yugoslavia March 1999

10:32.576 --> 10:37.342
BALKAN RUBBER

10:39.992 --> 10:44.171
Stefan, I'm afraid, faster, please!

10:44.366 --> 10:48.377
What are you afraid of? There are no military objects there. Nothing to bomber.

10:49.031 --> 10:53.392
I'm not afraid of that, stupid. I just want my child to be okay.

10:53.472 --> 10:58.449
Everything will be fine. And the bombs are a salute. Salut for the birth of my son.

10:58.529 --> 11:01.282
The Firstborn! In honor of the new Bukajevic, do you understand?

11:01.362 --> 11:05.952
Bukajevic is born under the bombs! - And I did a little too.

11:06.917 --> 11:10.367
True ... Add a little.

11:33.864 --> 11:38.039
Come on, my love ... The cue ... It's gonna be all right.

11:38.139 --> 11:41.273
Do not worry, slowly ... Carefully.

11:41.353 --> 11:45.548
Come on, do not worry. Do you believe me? Everything will be great!

11:45.648 --> 11:48.624
Come on. Bring the papers and things.

11:48.704 --> 11:51.946
Everything is in my bag. "Yes, yes, I will."

11:52.026 --> 11:55.443
Do not be excited, everything will be fine. "Come on, dear."

11:57.062 --> 11:59.062
I love you!

12:18.559 --> 12:22.318
Bring it up. We will try to save the child.

12:51.992 --> 12:55.155
This is a mother's house, swine goddamn!

12:55.247 --> 12:59.099
Go to the basement! Everyone in the basement!

12:59.489 --> 13:01.314
In the basement!

13:01.414 --> 13:03.525
Toshka, Toshka!

13:12.769 --> 13:15.295
Do not go there. No, do not go there!

13:15.375 --> 13:18.369
Do not- "" Toshka, Toshka!

14:35.875 --> 14:39.554
Now, you will not help her. Do you hear me?

14:39.634 --> 14:41.907
Come on!

14:42.007 --> 14:44.847
Come!

15:31.237 --> 15:37.850
<i> ... for the fact that the first air attacks killed women and children. </ i></i>

15:40.171 --> 15:45.588
<i> There has been a tragedy in Kosovo - according to various data, 20-70 people are killed. </ i></i>

15:45.668 --> 15:49.778
<i> We have joined forces with NATO partners against the Serbian Armed Forces. </ i></i>

15:50.484 --> 15:55.144
<i> Because of this, Pratakov ordered the plane to turn and return. </ i></i>

16:08.668 --> 16:12.755
Moscow, Russia June 1999

16:12.978 --> 16:16.389
Health I wish, etc. General!

16:16.489 --> 16:19.977
So, the bombings in Yugoslavia will soon be over.

16:20.057 --> 16:23.377
The Serbs will respond to them, but once their army comes out of Kosovo, the real power in the region

16:23.457 --> 16:25.779
will pass into the hands of Albanian rebels.

16:25.879 --> 16:29.763
NATO troops will stop the bombing and come as peacekeepers.

16:29.843 --> 16:32.062
What I will tell you is absolutely secret.

16:32.142 --> 16:34.934
There is only one large airport in Kosovo - Pristina.

16:35.014 --> 16:37.018
This will be the British responsibility sector.

16:37.098 --> 16:39.671
Only transport planes can land there.

16:39.751 --> 16:44.305
We have the task of taking the airport under control before the arrival of the English.

16:44.397 --> 16:48.310
For this purpose, military equipment will be sent from Bosnia to our peacekeepers.

16:48.410 --> 16:52.823
Your task is to borrow the airport and keep it until the dealers arrive.

16:52.967 --> 16:55.583
Do you have people?

16:57.071 --> 17:00.700
Andrew Shalalov's band. All of them remained in Yugoslavia.

17:00.780 --> 17:02.976
Shatalov? Was Bosna a bit you?

17:03.056 --> 17:07.276
I do not trust Shatalov, but I need his band.

17:07.376 --> 17:11.066
Victor Ivanovich, without them I can not master the airport.

17:12.626 --> 17:15.377
Glogovac, Yugoslavia June 1999

17:21.335 --> 17:25.377
Military warlords from NATO are thirsty for blood

17:26.135 --> 17:27.977
Clinton is a pedal

17:45.671 --> 17:48.263
Hello!

17:54.652 --> 17:58.732
Hello, Uncle Rade! Boyan has a birthday today.

17:58.832 --> 18:02.048
Pick up the phone!

18:02.379 --> 18:06.140
You are standing well. Okay ... - Hi! Where's Dad?

18:06.220 --> 18:09.120
Oh, Rade, hello. Here somewhere...

18:09.200 --> 18:12.045
Pick up the damn phone!

18:12.125 --> 18:14.614
Rade!

18:16.051 --> 18:19.206
Goran, Rade came!

18:20.052 --> 18:23.143
Pick up the phone, de!

18:23.539 --> 18:27.907
Mom! Please reduce the TV! It's like a disco.

18:27.987 --> 18:31.452
Just try closing the door!

18:31.959 --> 18:35.015
Do you want to bury me in this warehouse? - Come on ... it started!

18:35.095 --> 18:38.017
A shrewd sham!

18:40.387 --> 18:43.461
Rade, you did not find it - I can not with one hand.

18:43.541 --> 18:46.792
Elohus, then you will eat. Go to play in the yard.

18:46.872 --> 18:51.079
Come on, kids - there is better, and I have to work.

18:54.405 --> 18:59.532
It was very difficult for me to do it. I got 10,000.

19:00.364 --> 19:03.151
What are you kidding? Am I totally stupid?

19:03.231 --> 19:07.336
He took your family out of the bombs! Better offer him a job!

19:07.416 --> 19:11.108
A shrewd sham! "Enough, Mom!

19:11.336 --> 19:15.182
The passport is fake.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.766
Moment.

19:21.408 --> 19:23.026
Hello? - Goran?

19:23.106 --> 19:24.357
Yes?

19:24.457 --> 19:28.050
Why did not you pick up the phone? Haika! The police are in you!

19:28.130 --> 19:30.217
What ?!

19:31.941 --> 19:35.406
Oh, Goran, life does not teach you anything!

19:35.506 --> 19:39.417
Ah, Commander Milic! What a joy in Bulgaria!

19:39.517 --> 19:43.408
Woman, make coffee to our dear guests!

19:48.135 --> 19:52.562
What are you doing in the territory of Yugoslavia?

19:57.729 --> 20:00.800
Leave us alone.

20:02.394 --> 20:05.342
Me too?

20:11.208 --> 20:14.417
We found it in your backpack.

20:15.154 --> 20:19.606
People, people, there is nothing. Old TVs, trinkets ...

20:19.706 --> 20:21.773
Colleague...

20:22.360 --> 20:25.775
Smuggling of cigarettes - five to seven years.

20:25.855 --> 20:28.763
This is not smuggling, I have prepared it as a gift for you.

20:28.843 --> 20:31.404
I wanted to surprise you; did not happen...

20:31.484 --> 20:35.334
An attempt to bribe an official - three to five ...

20:36.072 --> 20:38.970
Everything together - at least eight years.

20:39.050 --> 20:42.097
And here what do you hold?

20:42.177 --> 20:43.606
Fifteen years?

20:43.706 --> 20:47.952
I am a hunter and help our people - is it war?

20:51.701 --> 20:54.728
We play with the boys.

20:55.347 --> 20:59.503
Do you know what coats I have for your girls? Fantastic are!

20:59.583 --> 21:01.717
Genuine leather with hair! - Skin?

21:01.817 --> 21:03.049
Are you a fool? - Why?

21:03.129 --> 21:05.685
Do you know that this crazy Albanian loves the animals?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.359
The wound will open now! He will kill us all!

21:08.439 --> 21:12.651
Better run for brandy, and I'll try to calm him down.

21:12.903 --> 21:17.106
Do I love animals? The other way you play the psychopath.

21:19.701 --> 21:22.930
I will offer you two options: Option A:

21:23.010 --> 21:27.278
Now I, without much talk, get my coffee,

21:27.618 --> 21:33.058
then we go to the plot. From there, we deport you to Russia.

21:33.260 --> 21:37.238
Option B: You tell me everything ...

21:37.318 --> 21:41.834
and if I like your story, I can give you a job.

21:42.874 --> 21:47.052
I hope I said everything right and you understood me.

21:51.543 --> 21:54.918
Belgrade, Yugoslavia June 1999

21:58.139 --> 22:00.255
Doctor ...

22:01.029 --> 22:03.966
Sister, X-ray. - Thanks.

22:04.066 --> 22:07.443
Clear, well, you're here.

22:07.674 --> 22:11.589
I wanted to talk; in our ward in Kosovo urgently needed medics.

22:11.669 --> 22:15.442
I suggested you. The department heads Dr. Stern.

22:15.522 --> 22:18.391
Excellent doctor from Switzerland.

22:26.398 --> 22:28.982
What is this?

22:29.658 --> 22:32.415
I can not any more.

22:33.223 --> 22:36.220
Do you want to leave when doctors need it?

22:36.300 --> 22:39.348
It's hard for me- "" It's a war, it's hard for everyone.

22:39.428 --> 22:42.026
I constantly hear their cries ...

22:42.107 --> 22:47.128
I saved one, but I could save more. I had to do it.

22:47.714 --> 22:53.688
Excuse me. Mariana Ilic - 25 years old; Week 32. Bloody bleeding.

23:04.933 --> 23:08.363
In the emergency operation!

23:11.991 --> 23:16.712
It is better to save a life than nothing to do!

23:57.903 --> 23:59.950
Live Serbia!

24:00.541 --> 24:04.482
Go, go ... What is this language, I do not understand anything.

24:23.868 --> 24:25.868
Gereev!

24:27.263 --> 24:29.263
Geree!

24:29.631 --> 24:31.860
But he broke!

24:35.238 --> 24:38.042
Hello bro!

24:39.683 --> 24:41.949
When you call me, I did not believe in my ears!

24:42.029 --> 24:43.618
Salam ... (peace, hello) - Salam!

24:43.698 --> 24:44.857
How did you find me?

24:44.937 --> 24:48.402
For four years it was issued 7 times, unlike the rest.

24:48.482 --> 24:52.000
But you have chosen a place- "" I had to get some information.

24:52.080 --> 24:55.228
Yeah, I saw what you were getting out there.

24:55.332 --> 24:57.332
Yes.

25:01.132 --> 25:04.515
Interesting is their form of protest.

25:04.595 --> 25:08.305
Yes, such a nation is they - bombard them, and they sing!

25:18.406 --> 25:20.633
Shaitan will not participate.

25:21.367 --> 25:23.928
What is the job - in short? - Take the airport.

25:24.008 --> 25:27.583
And wait for the BTRs with the landing. - BTR? What BTRs?

25:27.835 --> 25:31.085
Location of Russian peacekeepers Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 1999

25:31.174 --> 25:34.450
Crew 249 is ready to perform the training task!

25:34.530 --> 25:38.102
Crew 341 is ready to train 249th!

25:38.182 --> 25:40.270
Run, get ready for a start!

25:40.350 --> 25:42.988
Attention, ahead!

25:44.475 --> 25:48.788
You fell asleep at the start, fucking Schumacher! - We'll cut them off at the "speed"!

25:51.016 --> 25:55.516
We will see who will pass the distance according to the normative time.

25:56.979 --> 26:01.017
Catch us, reduce! - We'll do it now.

26:01.390 --> 26:03.499
Go left!

26:11.806 --> 26:15.287
Now someone will swallow dust ...

26:15.688 --> 26:18.569
Give gas, friend!

26:27.416 --> 26:31.338
Come on, a fat ass - just give gas, pedal to the floor!

26:38.035 --> 26:40.531
They are already swallowing ...

26:40.647 --> 26:43.647
Overtake them to the left!

26:43.727 --> 26:45.727
Reduce, reduce!

26:51.144 --> 26:54.785
Ah, what happened to me, huh?

26:55.124 --> 26:59.129
We pass through the 21st stretch!

27:07.211 --> 27:10.673
Happy bath! - Oh, beautiful; come on, give gas!

27:11.075 --> 27:13.464
They jumped, damn it! "How are you, Ichthyandri?"

27:13.564 --> 27:17.268
Normally, gentlemen - we wet our asses, we roam - as much as we can.

27:17.368 --> 27:20.301
Good running ...

27:21.085 --> 27:22.895
Give gas, give gas!

27:22.995 --> 27:25.044
Gas, gas ...

27:30.688 --> 27:34.142
Get gas! "Where are we going now?"

27:34.222 --> 27:36.840
Go! - The turbine will be fucked!

27:36.920 --> 27:40.159
Shut up, there is a swamp! We are at the border.

27:40.239 --> 27:43.116
Press him!

27:47.778 --> 27:49.778
Stay!

27:56.687 --> 27:58.824
We fixed them!

27:59.393 --> 28:02.831
That bastard! Go back!

28:03.271 --> 28:07.293
Dr. Colonel! General Somov looks for you on the satellite connection.

28:11.498 --> 28:14.445
Polotorotsky! You better prepare the fighters.

28:14.545 --> 28:16.545
Listen!

28:16.924 --> 28:19.037
To prepare them better ...

28:20.164 --> 28:22.650
Nicholas ... my condolences.

28:22.730 --> 28:24.919
Fuck you!

28:29.520 --> 28:32.005
Colonel LADOV. Health I wish, etc. General!

28:32.105 --> 28:35.814
Ladov, the decision to jump in Pristina is well established.

28:35.894 --> 28:37.977
Do you understand? - Aye!

28:38.077 --> 28:40.738
The task is to get the airport ahead of the Allies

28:40.838 --> 28:43.466
and to prevent leakage of information to NATO.

28:43.566 --> 28:46.102
Run! - Listen!

28:46.576 --> 28:49.057
End the link!

28:52.625 --> 28:54.706
At last!

30:04.938 --> 30:06.900
Nadia ...

30:07.000 --> 30:08.720
Nadia!

30:08.820 --> 30:10.836
Come here...

30:11.198 --> 30:14.650
It's me ... your uncle.

30:46.614 --> 30:50.066
<i> Death of the Sons </ i></i>

30:56.808 --> 31:00.218
Commander ... Commander Milic!

31:00.451 --> 31:03.715
I checked everything ... Nobody survived.

31:04.451 --> 31:09.025
Let's go to work. - Right at the feast - freak out!

31:35.897 --> 31:42.586
Slatina Airport, Pristina, Yugoslavia June 1999

31:42.886 --> 31:45.038
They're not even an army.

31:45.118 --> 31:48.566
Bandits in uniform. Their commander is called Smuk.

31:48.666 --> 31:50.907
Real animals ...

31:51.007 --> 31:53.221
The village of Vuk is fifth in line.

31:53.301 --> 31:56.934
They come, they kill, someone takes them in captivity ...

31:57.530 --> 32:01.388
and two days ago they took over that airport.

32:01.468 --> 32:03.863
Now here is their base.

32:03.943 --> 32:07.628
We know where the beast is, and we can not kill him.

32:07.728 --> 32:12.413
When our troops withdraw, there will be full lawlessness.

32:12.493 --> 32:14.979
What do you want from me?

32:15.329 --> 32:17.582
We're not going to deal with four.

32:17.662 --> 32:20.786
Do you know how many people I lost in half a year?

32:20.866 --> 32:25.097
But we can get volunteers. "Your volunteers do not know anything.

32:25.197 --> 32:27.527
You know!

32:27.607 --> 32:30.603
Volunteer soldiers made me.

32:30.683 --> 32:35.026
Milic, once again: This problem is unsolvable without outside help.

32:35.122 --> 32:37.845
Kosovo and Metohija, Yugoslavia

32:49.779 --> 32:54.031
Hell, that's a real airbob, is not it?

32:54.401 --> 32:58.657
Better wear the protective suit. - Is he helping?

32:59.830 --> 33:03.115
Do you have children? - No...

33:03.215 --> 33:05.287
Well then.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.968
Lord, save and save!

33:18.682 --> 33:21.633
Hi, Barmin!

33:23.706 --> 33:26.872
Chakak, Yugoslavia

33:33.975 --> 33:38.164
Hi sweety! Will we have some fun? - No. I'm not here for that.

33:38.684 --> 33:42.181
Are you a Russian? Are you looking for something special?

33:42.261 --> 33:44.029
You could say so.

33:44.109 --> 33:48.289
... blast his machine gun into his ass - just see him liked.

33:49.341 --> 33:50.522
Hello!

33:50.622 --> 33:53.539
Kragujevac, Yugoslavia

33:54.587 --> 33:58.970
Are we silent? To wipe our legs with us? Fuck them!

34:04.711 --> 34:09.380
What do you think - when will this end?

34:09.480 --> 34:12.299
It's me ...

34:14.074 --> 34:16.000
I'm not going there.

34:16.100 --> 34:20.362
Better pushing instead of pouring in here every day.

34:22.481 --> 34:25.190
And I narrow myself down to ask - what are you doing here?

34:25.270 --> 34:29.317
Do not worry. I work as a guard. And what are you doing here?

34:29.417 --> 34:33.174
By the way ... a good question. "Well, here you are not locked.

34:33.254 --> 34:37.900
Look, you're having fun ... "" I'm consulting the Yugoslavs.

34:38.016 --> 34:41.476
A "gift" by the French. - Well done!

34:41.576 --> 34:44.407
Will not you win, by chance?

34:44.516 --> 34:47.097
I'm old for such things.

34:47.177 --> 34:49.177
Although...

34:49.364 --> 34:51.364
Give me a cigarette.

34:51.556 --> 34:55.888
Here they bombard us every day. We hope for you.

34:55.967 --> 34:59.837
The Russians will not ditch us. The Russians are brothers ...

34:59.917 --> 35:01.966
And the Russians are silent.

35:02.046 --> 35:04.078
Have you leaned?

35:04.403 --> 35:07.365
What is the job? - Secret.

35:07.445 --> 35:10.764
In short: I'm collecting Sha'tai's team. There is a task.

35:10.844 --> 35:14.904
If you do it ... they'll let you go back to Russia.

35:16.905 --> 35:19.694
You bent, you bastard!

35:19.794 --> 35:22.936
Quiet, honey ... Hello Helios!

35:23.036 --> 35:25.556
Relax, guys, it's all right!

35:25.636 --> 35:28.668
We need to talk.

35:28.842 --> 35:30.893
Weapon has ...

35:30.993 --> 35:34.115
And where is the guarantee that the power will not reflect and imprison us?

35:34.195 --> 35:36.855
I am the guarantee!

35:38.101 --> 35:41.113
I'm glad to see you.

35:41.213 --> 35:45.047
Well, did it bring you life? To beat brothers Serbs?

35:45.297 --> 35:48.521
Psychic is everywhere. Nationality is irrelevant.

35:48.621 --> 35:51.492
It's so ... "" Go on, Beck.

35:51.902 --> 35:56.321
Vera ... There's a drunken client ... beating Vishnya.

35:56.633 --> 35:59.625
Until recently ... "" Stay!

36:01.642 --> 36:04.643
If you think suddenly ...

36:15.240 --> 36:18.108
Glory to Normandy Neman!

36:18.538 --> 36:22.237
They did not want the French to really bomber -

36:22.317 --> 36:24.422
they threw a school ...

36:24.502 --> 36:27.060
Oh, shit!

36:28.009 --> 36:32.277
You will go home, with all the orders and medals ...

36:32.357 --> 36:35.534
Here's how things are.

37:09.867 --> 37:12.695
I remembered you, an abnormal!

37:12.795 --> 37:14.246
Beck ...

37:14.346 --> 37:16.957
I come with you!

37:18.626 --> 37:22.207
You tell these about the orders and your home to Gerey, is not it?

37:30.014 --> 37:32.435
$ 10,000

37:35.714 --> 37:37.549
What is this?

37:37.629 --> 37:42.046
If you want me with you, there is no problem. And that's the amount I'm going to go for.

37:48.468 --> 37:52.313
Yes ... psychics are everywhere.

38:06.093 --> 38:09.153
Here are the keys.

38:10.623 --> 38:13.731
We there, everything ...

38:21.611 --> 38:24.354
Do you want brandy?

38:30.194 --> 38:33.041
Hang on, brother!

38:37.371 --> 38:39.572
Brother?

38:40.765 --> 38:45.458
What kind of brother are you, Albanian ?! - Vuk, do not ...

38:51.331 --> 38:57.194
Yes, our faith is different. But I've proven to be your brother many times!

38:57.294 --> 38:59.937
Listen to me, hey!

39:00.037 --> 39:06.112
Piss, cry, hit me if you need to ...

39:06.709 --> 39:10.233
just do not keep that in yourself.

39:14.629 --> 39:18.541
Hello guys! Three families left the village today.

39:18.621 --> 39:21.090
They have nothing to pay the Smoke tax gang, "goodbye."

39:21.170 --> 39:25.310
Their Albanian neighbors were called and said they would be robbed by the road.

39:25.410 --> 39:28.096
When did they leave? - About an hour ago.

39:28.176 --> 39:30.566
Time is short. We will not be able to warn them.

39:30.666 --> 39:33.280
Let's go!

39:49.655 --> 39:52.612
The bus is for you!

39:55.268 --> 39:58.237
Excellent opportunity to catch Smoke at the crime scene.

39:58.317 --> 40:03.029
We start when he appears. Hardly his men will go to the column.

40:03.109 --> 40:06.167
We'll wait for them on the road.

40:06.247 --> 40:09.423
Here is the easiest way to get the transport - before the fork.

40:09.503 --> 40:12.924
If we hurry, we'll be there before them.

40:43.149 --> 40:47.402
On the way, I see three; The smoke is gone.

40:48.542 --> 40:52.893
Where did he go, Vuk? Milic told us to wait in the car.

40:57.776 --> 41:00.942
Vuk, stay! - Leave me, Fadil!

41:01.192 --> 41:04.230
This is an order!

41:14.509 --> 41:17.384
Vuk went ...

41:20.786 --> 41:24.034
Yes, he is ... shit!

41:26.867 --> 41:31.484
There's a target ... Chuck until you're done with the sniper.

41:57.356 --> 41:59.356
Fytim!

42:01.751 --> 42:03.751
Fytim!

42:18.933 --> 42:21.310
Come on, get up ... Get up!

42:21.579 --> 42:25.470
I will kill her! Do not shoot!

42:28.321 --> 42:30.645
I will kill her!

43:11.585 --> 43:13.636
Come on!

43:14.548 --> 43:17.630
Come on, finish me. - Vuk, no ...

43:18.663 --> 43:23.359
Fadil, Fadil ... for the traitors like you, we are cutting a separate knife!

43:23.453 --> 43:25.778
Keep silent, Bashkin, otherwise I'll shoot you.

43:25.858 --> 43:28.068
Vuk ...

43:29.088 --> 43:31.407
Stay! Put down the gun!

43:31.507 --> 43:34.213
This is an order! We are not bandits.

43:34.293 --> 43:38.931
There is a law in Bulgaria! - And they're bombing us ...

43:39.011 --> 43:41.408
And they kill us by the law.

43:41.508 --> 43:45.395
What law are you talking about? "He's a criminal,

43:45.495 --> 43:48.905
but you do not decide whether to live or not.

44:12.730 --> 44:15.252
Stay! - Do not...

44:15.828 --> 44:19.066
Let's go.

44:32.892 --> 44:35.046
Andrew!

44:37.873 --> 44:43.456
Bravo, I'm good. I will give you a passport. Here is the address.

44:47.902 --> 44:51.597
I hope to see you again.

45:01.750 --> 45:05.058
Dr. Lieutenant, let me ask, not the statutes.

45:05.158 --> 45:08.812
Ask, etc. Corporal! Then - your ass is cool!

45:09.833 --> 45:12.648
How much more? We'll wipe this bumper into a hole!

45:12.728 --> 45:14.874
Behold, the eggs are already shining like a cat!

45:15.024 --> 45:20.358
Fighters! Today, you ... have stood up!

45:22.146 --> 45:27.299
You beat the squad ... and what's worse - the whole battalion!

45:27.714 --> 45:30.559
And our kind troops, and along with this -

45:30.659 --> 45:33.613
all the armed forces of the Russian Federation!

45:33.760 --> 45:36.640
What if tomorrow is war? A?

45:36.857 --> 45:39.784
I answer my own question, Comrade Guards Corporal!

45:39.864 --> 45:43.526
If war is going on, you will fight, sunk in your own shit!

45:43.606 --> 45:46.324
Polotorotsky! - Dr. Major!

45:46.405 --> 45:48.722
The staff of the first platoon conducts ...

45:48.802 --> 45:51.885
I see your work! Finish this circus!

45:52.036 --> 45:54.081
Brake!

45:54.382 --> 45:58.135
By the morning, check the technical condition of all machines!

45:58.235 --> 46:00.330
Aye!

46:00.743 --> 46:04.493
Finish! Fuck those!

46:04.693 --> 46:08.136
Finish, Schumacher!

46:12.032 --> 46:14.032
Samun!

46:22.477 --> 46:25.112
But they have chosen!

46:28.127 --> 46:31.055
Hello guys!

46:31.155 --> 46:33.384
Hello, bandit! "Just jerk, Barja!

46:33.464 --> 46:35.572
I thought you were a retiree now? Is not it yet?

46:35.652 --> 46:38.812
Do not say that! - Do you have cigarettes?

46:38.915 --> 46:41.133
Are you still smoking, asshole? You must refuse them!

46:41.213 --> 46:43.193
Hello, girls! - Shit old!

46:43.273 --> 46:46.469
Gerey, do not start! - I'm also glad to see you.

46:46.549 --> 46:48.490
Hello! - Vera, give a cigarette.

46:48.570 --> 46:50.706
I denied them.

46:50.972 --> 46:53.681
Immediately I pass by essence: the time is small.

46:53.761 --> 46:59.659
Since the 95th, many things have changed. Now we make the decisions on our own - without NATO.

46:59.759 --> 47:03.696
It's a task ... and if you do it with me,

47:03.776 --> 47:09.243
will restore you to the army; awards, but most importantly: you come back home ...

47:09.772 --> 47:13.195
and they will meet you as heroes.

47:16.169 --> 47:19.089
And where is Shaitan?

47:19.542 --> 47:23.728
The operation is leading me.

47:32.644 --> 47:35.023
Thanks.

47:39.918 --> 47:43.524
Excuse me. - No, excuse me.

47:44.090 --> 47:48.435
You have wonderful reactions. "I was always a goalkeeper in childhood.

47:49.578 --> 47:52.352
Clear ... - Rade.

47:52.432 --> 47:56.059
Let's go!

48:01.749 --> 48:06.784
Help God ... Is the Bus for Prizren? Come on, Misho, faster!

48:08.515 --> 48:11.332
Let's go!

48:55.114 --> 48:57.402
Dad!

49:13.023 --> 49:15.931
Sit, your mom!

49:17.032 --> 49:20.030
Pray, son ...

49:30.947 --> 49:35.451
You entered the territory of the Republic of Kosovo.

49:35.531 --> 49:39.930
All arrivals undergo a screening procedure.

49:40.010 --> 49:43.769
Prepare your documents and personal belongings.

49:43.849 --> 49:50.963
Any resistance of the lawful authorities will be punished mercilessly!

49:51.043 --> 49:54.633
Hey ... Who are you?

49:56.746 --> 49:59.816
Rade Tonic. - What is this accent?

49:59.896 --> 50:02.975
Are you a Serb? "Yes ... but I grew up in Russia.

50:03.055 --> 50:08.279
My mother is Russian. I came to a relative - he has diabetes.

50:09.567 --> 50:12.105
Documents!

50:36.177 --> 50:38.745
Lord, please!

50:38.825 --> 50:44.756
Son, please ... let us. "I'm not a" son, "a Serb bitch!

50:44.836 --> 50:48.173
Hey, what are you doing?

50:50.226 --> 50:54.428
Did he say something, pop? Answer!

50:57.294 --> 51:00.785
These are liturgical things they do not need.

51:01.841 --> 51:05.818
It is not good to touch that.

51:17.701 --> 51:22.114
Jasna Blagoevich. I'm traveling to the hospital in Glogowice.

51:22.465 --> 51:25.045
Here are my papers.

51:48.386 --> 51:54.484
Pop, pop, you're a smuggler?

51:55.257 --> 51:58.274
What is that?

51:59.801 --> 52:02.408
See ... Yeah!

52:04.310 --> 52:09.460
Please stop. These are sacred things, understand.

52:10.207 --> 52:14.958
Abe, people ... you too are believers!

52:16.269 --> 52:19.873
You believe in Allah; we - in Christ ...

52:20.631 --> 52:24.199
Let's at least respect each other.

52:26.500 --> 52:29.823
Do we respect?

52:30.436 --> 52:36.174
Then say, "There is no God but Allah!"

52:38.069 --> 52:40.773
Come on, tell him!

52:41.019 --> 52:44.026
Can you hear me, come on!

52:44.418 --> 52:47.058
Honor me, pop.

52:47.515 --> 52:50.637
Come on ... talk!

52:50.737 --> 52:53.524
I can not, I'm a Christian.

52:55.842 --> 52:58.105
Dad ...

52:58.510 --> 53:00.672
Talk!

53:01.568 --> 53:03.011
Come on.

53:03.111 --> 53:04.885
Come on!

53:04.985 --> 53:07.269
Tell him, de!

53:12.560 --> 53:13.944
Christ is Bo ...

53:14.044 --> 53:16.044
Dad!

53:16.246 --> 53:18.248
What are you doing?!

53:54.610 --> 53:58.716
Tell them to throw the weapons or go to your Allah!

53:58.816 --> 54:01.065
Throw the guns!

54:01.281 --> 54:03.281
Throw them away.

54:13.087 --> 54:14.855
In the bus.

54:14.953 --> 54:17.853
Everyone in the bus!

54:19.532 --> 54:22.097
Run on the bus!

54:28.380 --> 54:31.912
I will touch you, Russian!

54:34.599 --> 54:37.412
Come on ... Come on, fast!

54:51.018 --> 54:54.089
I'm going for doctors.

54:57.781 --> 55:00.262
Faster ... that way.

55:03.083 --> 55:06.091
I am Dr. Stern. What happened? Do you speak English?

55:06.191 --> 55:10.099
Yes. We were attacked by bandits and terrorized us.

55:10.199 --> 55:14.060
If it were not this young man, we would not have been there anymore.

55:14.362 --> 55:18.026
What's wrong with the boy? - Severe head trauma.

55:18.106 --> 55:20.842
They told me they were traveling to the monastery near Prizren.

55:20.922 --> 55:25.333
The boy in the intense; the rest - in the reception room.

55:25.844 --> 55:29.306
They and the boy went to the monastery near Prizren, with Father John.

55:29.386 --> 55:33.568
Where can we find a car? - Where to find a car, the body?

55:33.648 --> 55:35.858
Do not worry, I'll help you with the car.

55:35.938 --> 55:37.639
Thanks.

55:37.719 --> 55:42.642
Where can I wash? - Come on, I'll show you.

55:45.505 --> 55:49.519
Here, take it. These are the things of the account; take them.

55:49.809 --> 55:53.944
Thanks. "No ... thank you, son.

56:46.472 --> 56:49.934
I will take the priest's body.

56:53.079 --> 56:55.495
Wait, wait ...

56:56.078 --> 56:59.085
May I come with you?

57:56.198 --> 57:59.617
Accept our condolences.

58:01.496 --> 58:05.666
And with Misho what's going on? "He's in the hospital in Glogowice.

58:05.746 --> 58:09.770
The trauma of his head is serious, but his condition is stable.

58:09.850 --> 58:13.314
I'll take care of Misho.

58:13.986 --> 58:17.434
Oh, brother, how did it happen ...

58:18.450 --> 58:21.716
Take it away.

58:22.400 --> 58:27.405
Father ... they asked me to tell you ...

58:34.986 --> 58:39.619
Give this to Misho. This is his heavenly patron.

58:40.926 --> 58:45.783
We will go. - I'm gonna pray for your family.

58:45.863 --> 58:48.500
Do you have children?

58:49.512 --> 58:51.872
God bless you!

58:51.972 --> 58:54.151
Farewell.

58:54.629 --> 58:56.763
Farewell.

59:21.253 --> 59:23.358
Thanks.

59:25.395 --> 59:29.351
Only now do I begin to realize what happened in the morning.

59:33.942 --> 59:37.389
We're in town now. Where do I get you?

59:37.469 --> 59:40.968
In the hospital. They allowed me to stay there.

59:41.048 --> 59:44.705
You can stay in my home. Anyway, I do not appear there.

59:46.819 --> 59:50.949
I do not want to hurt you ... "" How will you stop me?

59:54.930 --> 59:57.063
Thanks.

59:59.626 --> 01:00:03.701
In the morning I'll go to the hospital.

01:00:21.154 --> 01:00:24.531
End - come on, go home. Greet my mom.

01:00:24.611 --> 01:00:27.517
And can it be with you? - Come on, sleep!

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:34.816
You have to watch overnight. Go, wicked!

01:00:34.896 --> 01:00:38.319
C'mon, c'mon. Come on!

01:00:52.463 --> 01:00:58.086
Well, Grandpa? Do you want to live yet?

01:00:58.671 --> 01:01:01.556
Not necessarily.

01:01:06.887 --> 01:01:10.584
A Russian Serb is serving in your area.

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:16.675
Tell me where he is and you can go home.

01:01:17.703 --> 01:01:20.442
Where is the Russian Serb? - Yes.

01:01:21.085 --> 01:01:22.803
Option A:

01:01:22.903 --> 01:01:24.945
I do not know.

01:01:25.045 --> 01:01:27.179
Option B:

01:01:27.412 --> 01:01:31.109
I do not want to tell you. Choose.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:36.371
Do you know what I can do with you? "I know what you can not do.

01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:40.889
You can not buy me, you can not break me;

01:01:40.969 --> 01:01:43.458
you can only kill me ...

01:01:43.538 --> 01:01:46.505
In fact, you can ...

01:01:47.145 --> 01:01:50.711
and my ass to kiss!

01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:53.966
Stay, please, do not! Do not, do not ...

01:01:55.117 --> 01:01:57.619
Is it scary, garbage? - Please, my mother is sick ...

01:01:57.699 --> 01:02:00.005
She is waiting for me, worried ...

01:02:00.085 --> 01:02:03.710
I also had a mother ...

01:02:04.143 --> 01:02:08.080
I will not kill you, Milic ...

01:02:08.249 --> 01:02:11.445
I'll execute you ...

01:02:11.525 --> 01:02:14.368
Poor!

01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:19.947
Run!

01:02:21.941 --> 01:02:26.978
Listen to everyone! In the name of Greater Albania,

01:02:27.058 --> 01:02:31.273
for cooperation with Serbian occupiers,

01:02:32.242 --> 01:02:36.730
this Serb is sentenced to death!

01:02:41.727 --> 01:02:48.789
And so it will be with everyone who stands up against my power!

01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:53.626
Are you the legal authority ?! You are an ordinary bandit!

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:58.791
And Kosovo is Serbia! It has always been and will be!

01:02:58.871 --> 01:03:02.070
Do you want to kill Albanian?

01:03:02.348 --> 01:03:04.720
Do you want?

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.820
Come on ...

01:03:14.616 --> 01:03:16.743
Pick it up.

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:46.812
Bravo, Grandpa!

01:03:46.912 --> 01:03:48.912
Well done...

01:04:06.334 --> 01:04:09.910
Vuk ... who did you become?

01:04:11.187 --> 01:04:14.215
At the feast ...

01:04:16.261 --> 01:04:18.640
At the feast!

01:04:19.844 --> 01:04:23.828
Vuk ...

01:04:36.174 --> 01:04:38.202
Yes? <i> - Rade, here is Fadil. </ i></i>

01:04:38.282 --> 01:04:39.693
Hello!

01:04:39.773 --> 01:04:43.445
<i> Listen, we do not have much time. Now I'm with Vuk. </ I></i>

01:04:43.525 --> 01:04:46.590
<i> What do we do? </ i> - What are you talking about?</i>

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:50.152
<i> Do not you know? Smuk killed Milic. </ I></i>

01:04:50.252 --> 01:04:53.595
<i> You searched for, Rade. </ i></i>

01:05:06.265 --> 01:05:09.224
Doctor Stern wants to see you.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.540
Two failures on the track. Do you have fun, Smoke?

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.631
Why did you kill the Chief of Police - now we will have problems.

01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:44.962
What problems? - They stopped working with drugs.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.502
Your political future is questionable.

01:05:47.582 --> 01:05:51.893
That's right. get rid of the hostages and clean the airport from your shit.

01:05:51.973 --> 01:05:54.975
Until the coming of NATO troops, you do not have to be here!

01:05:55.055 --> 01:05:59.131
You command me? Do not you just forget, Doctor?

01:06:02.621 --> 01:06:07.073
My dear, it seems to me you have forgotten that I represent the interests of those,

01:06:07.153 --> 01:06:11.215
who convinced the whole world to help you get home!

01:06:11.315 --> 01:06:15.362
Do whatever I say!

01:06:27.457 --> 01:06:30.314
Do not let go!

01:06:36.222 --> 01:06:41.277
Devil savages! No, did you see? Did you see?

01:06:41.879 --> 01:06:46.448
This is totally unmanageable ... But they will put it in its place.

01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:56.413
What is this beret he has invaded? Have not he imagined that Che Guevara?

01:06:56.567 --> 01:06:58.769
What are they waiting for, why do not they open?

01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:02.004
Open now, hurry!

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:22.190
Amir, park the Doctor's car.

01:07:23.436 --> 01:07:25.152
Come on!

01:07:25.252 --> 01:07:28.149
Come on, get out of here!

01:07:34.343 --> 01:07:39.142
Our first date was short.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:42.696
We did not get to know each other.

01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:47.262
Your friend...

01:07:47.594 --> 01:07:50.191
prevented us.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.373
Damn.

01:07:58.751 --> 01:08:01.256
Killer!

01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:06.152
I'm not a killer!

01:08:06.232 --> 01:08:11.335
I only clean up my territory ...

01:08:16.202 --> 01:08:19.703
of all of you.

01:08:19.803 --> 01:08:21.803
C'mon, c'mon...

01:08:23.104 --> 01:08:28.622
Russians, Americans, Serbs ...

01:08:33.379 --> 01:08:38.823
You do not need me here; this is my home!

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:43.859
And I'll bell you to the last one!

01:08:44.778 --> 01:08:49.880
Where is that Russian who was traveling with you on the bus?

01:08:52.063 --> 01:08:54.258
I do not know.

01:08:57.432 --> 01:08:59.741
He does not know...

01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:10.417
Animal!

01:09:31.693 --> 01:09:35.923
Do I really look like an animal?

01:09:41.502 --> 01:09:44.953
Daughter ... come on, come on.

01:09:48.139 --> 01:09:50.676
Please dont...

01:09:52.736 --> 01:09:55.513
Really I do not know.

01:09:57.127 --> 01:10:01.032
Together you left the hospital.

01:10:02.479 --> 01:10:04.479
Where is the Russian?

01:10:05.621 --> 01:10:07.785
Where is?

01:10:18.611 --> 01:10:21.133
Where is he?

01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:23.485
Enough!

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:27.446
Well, here it is ...

01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:35.383
You see, proud Serbian, is not that complicated!

01:10:35.874 --> 01:10:39.142
Hide! - You could say right away ...

01:10:39.222 --> 01:10:41.661
and the girl would not die.

01:10:41.741 --> 01:10:46.157
Though ... one more serpent, or one less ...

01:10:46.237 --> 01:10:48.596
Naise ...

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:51.195
And so...

01:10:53.039 --> 01:10:55.408
I am listening to you.

01:10:55.721 --> 01:10:58.318
Do not touch the nurse!

01:10:58.768 --> 01:11:01.628
Smoke attacked one of ours.

01:11:01.949 --> 01:11:04.443
He was Vuk, a man of Milic.

01:11:04.523 --> 01:11:08.584
I know where she lives. - Collect yours and him!

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.974
What about you?

01:11:11.074 --> 01:11:14.465
And I'm going to visit Rade Tonic.

01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:49.701
Our task is to take over the airport in Slatina.

01:11:49.781 --> 01:11:52.442
We take it and hold positions until the peacekeepers come!

01:11:52.522 --> 01:11:57.887
And the most important; we have to take the airport so that no one understands this ...

01:11:57.987 --> 01:12:00.967
and who did it. Gerey ...

01:12:01.047 --> 01:12:03.851
There are 10-15 fighters on the site. They are all armed.

01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:06.105
They have a machine gun. The diagram shows everything.

01:12:06.185 --> 01:12:11.302
To negotiate; Barry and I - the dispatcher is for us ...

01:12:20.688 --> 01:12:24.792
Gerey and Slash - the hangars ... The checkpoint is also for you.

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.177
Vera takes the terminal ...

01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:04.998
Terminal is available.

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:09.494
Vera: everything is clean!

01:13:09.574 --> 01:13:11.086
So you're the commander?

01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:14.602
Yes, I am the commander. And I answer for everything!

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.193
Are there any questions? "Is our column coming from Bosnia?"

01:13:17.273 --> 01:13:20.492
Aye. - From Bosnia to here is 600 km.

01:13:20.592 --> 01:13:22.999
612, if we have to be accurate ...

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:26.632
Will they succeed?

01:13:27.104 --> 01:13:29.359
Plato will succeed.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:33.077
President Slobodan Milosevic has signed an agreement

01:13:33.157 --> 01:13:36.749
to withdraw the Allied troops of Yugoslavia from Kosovo.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:40.757
Thus, the management of this end is going to NATO.

01:13:40.857 --> 01:13:44.229
Our division has a task:

01:13:44.309 --> 01:13:49.245
In the shortest time we reach the outskirts of Pristina ...

01:13:49.414 --> 01:13:53.011
and take control of a strategically important site -

01:13:53.091 --> 01:13:58.352
Slatina Airport, before the arrival of the NATO Armored Brigade.

01:13:58.452 --> 01:14:04.313
We will go there as KFOR - International Peacekeeping Forces.

01:14:04.753 --> 01:14:08.542
We must be ready for any development of events.

01:14:08.642 --> 01:14:15.084
This includes a full-scale battle with a potential enemy.

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:18.096
By machines! - The machines!

01:14:18.176 --> 01:14:20.679
In places! - In places!

01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.738
If you are scary, just squat in the bushes!

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.619
What's going on?

01:15:15.699 --> 01:15:19.485
It's very quiet ... It's bad.

01:15:22.071 --> 01:15:24.473
Is there another way?

01:15:24.799 --> 01:15:28.106
There is ... through the gorge.

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:49.919
They are well equipped here.

01:16:02.492 --> 01:16:06.386
Only my heart stopped beating ...

01:16:07.925 --> 01:16:11.617
Beck, do you know ...

01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:16.367
I think they did not tell you everything about this airport.

01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:22.638
We hide ... We hide!

01:16:25.442 --> 01:16:27.697
We hide!

01:16:27.957 --> 01:16:29.957
Curse!

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.644
Amir! - I accept.

01:16:33.074 --> 01:16:37.472
The airport is not responsible. Go back and check what's going on there.

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:39.499
What about Vuk?

01:16:39.579 --> 01:16:41.723
He'll wait.

01:16:41.803 --> 01:16:44.384
Listen!

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:53.613
Within two or three hours they will die.

01:16:53.693 --> 01:16:55.138
Gerey ... - Yes?

01:16:55.218 --> 01:16:58.132
Need help, go to the dispatcher. - Understood...

01:17:17.308 --> 01:17:21.569
Slash, is it clear? "Yes, Beck, everything is clean.

01:17:26.945 --> 01:17:30.601
Once the checkpoint has passed, go.

01:18:52.432 --> 01:18:54.432
Shati ?!

01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:59.599
They are with me.

01:19:06.516 --> 01:19:08.516
They were lying!

01:19:08.628 --> 01:19:11.388
Leave it!

01:19:14.169 --> 01:19:17.710
How did you get here? - I have the same question.

01:19:18.058 --> 01:19:21.121
Gerey, what did you get for? - I wanted to welcome the commander.

01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:23.787
Why is my team here? "Now this is not your team!

01:19:23.867 --> 01:19:27.604
Then in Bosnia you misleaded everyone! Yourself, me and the boys!

01:19:27.957 --> 01:19:31.124
Once again, what are you doing here?

01:19:32.523 --> 01:19:35.475
This is the base of an Albanian terrorist. We came for him.

01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:40.697
How many people does he have? More than a hundred.

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:55.273
And these guerrillas what are they? - Local policemen.

01:19:55.353 --> 01:19:58.169
Let's get to know it right away: "Break off the beach!"

01:19:58.249 --> 01:20:02.618
Hey, man, I do not move from here until we've done what we've come to.

01:20:02.886 --> 01:20:06.146
I do not care what you're talking about. - I did not understand anything.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:09.711
Why are you standing, Geree, translate! - If we miss out on the monks ...

01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:11.918
He will not leave. - So, her ...

01:20:11.998 --> 01:20:15.996
Gerey, Slash, put them in the hangar! - Excuse me, Chatha.

01:20:16.636 --> 01:20:18.643
Beck ...

01:20:20.714 --> 01:20:24.361
Hey Hey! Enough! - Commander - a pickup machine with a machine gun.

01:20:24.441 --> 01:20:26.130
Is it far? - I can work.

01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:28.513
How many?

01:20:29.335 --> 01:20:31.016
Four.

01:20:31.096 --> 01:20:33.280
Ettly Ramush, I accept!

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.865
Get them down! Quiet!

01:20:34.945 --> 01:20:37.364
<i> Ramush, can you hear me? </ i> - It will not be quiet.</i>

01:20:37.444 --> 01:20:39.626
I accept!

01:20:40.893 --> 01:20:43.181
The solution?

01:20:46.243 --> 01:20:48.243
Commander, the solution?

01:20:56.511 --> 01:20:58.496
Terminal Sniper! - Get them off!

01:20:58.576 --> 01:21:00.576
Fire!

01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:21.750
300, hang me!

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:24.301
Hell, Vera.

01:21:24.388 --> 01:21:26.216
End, we got out.

01:21:26.296 --> 01:21:29.286
In short - come on, Shatalov, get involved!

01:21:29.366 --> 01:21:31.587
Why do we stand? Keep working.

01:21:31.667 --> 01:21:34.599
"Clean up" the hangars!

01:22:21.958 --> 01:22:24.256
Stay ...

01:22:24.437 --> 01:22:26.437
Clear?

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:29.509
Do not shoot.

01:22:40.147 --> 01:22:42.969
Where are we? - At Slatina Airport.

01:22:43.049 --> 01:22:45.732
How did you get here?

01:22:45.812 --> 01:22:51.042
Dr. Stern and the one who killed the father work together.

01:22:55.515 --> 01:22:58.618
I told him where you lived.

01:22:58.698 --> 01:23:01.064
Forgive me...

01:23:07.447 --> 01:23:11.257
In our situation, it is no longer the same.

01:23:11.337 --> 01:23:13.653
What kind of situation?

01:23:32.447 --> 01:23:35.337
Smoke ... - Yes?

01:23:37.852 --> 01:23:40.577
They took the airport.

01:23:44.298 --> 01:23:46.801
Who?

01:23:48.266 --> 01:23:50.287
I do not know.

01:23:50.367 --> 01:23:53.099
They attacked us.

01:23:53.199 --> 01:23:56.085
Fucking coward!

01:24:04.398 --> 01:24:09.299
Explain who took the airport, for what purpose and how many?

01:24:10.327 --> 01:24:15.811
If you run away again today, I will personally shoot you!

01:24:17.834 --> 01:24:19.834
Total sum!

01:24:20.181 --> 01:24:23.916
Full combat readiness!

01:24:25.445 --> 01:24:27.952
Will be fulfilled!

01:24:40.545 --> 01:24:43.917
What do you think, can you really fight for the airport?

01:24:44.017 --> 01:24:46.450
Did you see Platov's face?

01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:49.468
Something serious. So far it is not clear what.

01:24:49.568 --> 01:24:53.297
Maybe we know that we are traveling? "The operation is secret - it should not.

01:24:53.397 --> 01:24:55.212
Listen, clowns!

01:24:55.292 --> 01:24:59.401
You are scared of the chase, but you have no right to hate at the airport!

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:04.100
And if you grind not the task, I will put the thickest on the head of the smartest!

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:06.599
Aye!

01:25:14.866 --> 01:25:18.142
The airport is in the area of interest of a local rebel.

01:25:18.242 --> 01:25:21.808
He has about a hundred people. We are eighth.

01:25:21.888 --> 01:25:25.140
Will the task change? - The task remains the same!

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.726
Hold the airport. - Listen, hold the airport.

01:25:27.806 --> 01:25:31.232
By the end of the operation - radio-silence mode.

01:25:31.312 --> 01:25:34.772
The column is already gone. There is no way back.

01:25:34.872 --> 01:25:38.184
Tomorrow morning - June 13, they will arrive in Slatina.

01:25:38.284 --> 01:25:40.702
By this time you have to disappear.

01:25:40.782 --> 01:25:42.840
Listen!

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.334
That's what I guarantee you.

01:25:48.511 --> 01:25:51.899
Is that your lucky hand? - Gadest ...

01:25:55.369 --> 01:25:59.568
Do you need help? "Chatha, come on,"

01:25:59.714 --> 01:26:02.966
How do you live, at all?

01:26:06.011 --> 01:26:09.662
Well, it was not the lightest four years of my life ...

01:26:11.177 --> 01:26:15.330
but I'm glad we're all together.

01:26:17.885 --> 01:26:21.038
Everyone gathered. - Excellent!

01:26:21.829 --> 01:26:25.374
Vera, how is the hand? - It works.

01:26:26.358 --> 01:26:28.551
Our situation is fucking ...

01:26:28.631 --> 01:26:32.400
The probability of living until the morning is about 10 percent ...

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.568
but we have the task of holding the airport.

01:26:35.648 --> 01:26:37.705
So we'll hold it.

01:26:37.785 --> 01:26:39.912
We're going all the way.

01:26:39.992 --> 01:26:42.916
Geree? - I agree, it will get hot.

01:26:42.996 --> 01:26:46.834
If we accomplish everything literate and clever, we will take 2-3 hours.

01:26:46.914 --> 01:26:49.268
And further on? - Further on ...

01:26:49.348 --> 01:26:51.677
We will further improvise.

01:26:51.777 --> 01:26:57.643
In short, we explain to the Serbs the task and define their place in the pipeline.

01:26:57.731 --> 01:27:02.153
Shatalov, once they remain, it is your responsibility.

01:27:02.233 --> 01:27:08.102
Do you understand? Just tell them that they will exactly follow my orders.

01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:11.033
Mine!

01:27:11.506 --> 01:27:12.970
End.

01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:17.496
Let's check the connection. We are glad to welcome guests.

01:27:18.036 --> 01:27:20.949
What did he say? "Come on, I'll explain everything to you.

01:27:21.029 --> 01:27:23.029
Chathai!

01:27:24.582 --> 01:27:28.289
I will explain everything to the blonde.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.448
God help you!

01:27:48.217 --> 01:27:51.561
Well, do you have ideas, Commander?

01:27:55.789 --> 01:27:58.930
We will prepare fireplaces throughout the territory.

01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:01.825
We will deploy weapons from the hangar - there is as much as you want;

01:28:01.918 --> 01:28:04.336
but with the cartridges we are bad. We will save.

01:28:04.416 --> 01:28:06.967
Who's on the terminal? "This is Gerey.

01:28:07.047 --> 01:28:11.483
The roof should be held in two directions. Let Fadil take it.

01:28:11.563 --> 01:28:15.390
Well, blonde, do you want to blow up Albanians?

01:28:16.534 --> 01:28:19.613
Cursed joker!

01:28:27.938 --> 01:28:31.881
Is that another retirement? - Let's do this job too ...

01:28:31.962 --> 01:28:35.905
and hard - in retirement. Come on, masquerade!

01:28:35.985 --> 01:28:41.221
Were we able to load the whole field? "We'll load it so they're gonna get hit!"

01:28:43.410 --> 01:28:45.973
Would it be more joyful than in Bosnia?

01:28:46.073 --> 01:28:47.792
Hang on.

01:28:47.887 --> 01:28:51.459
The main thing is not to overdo it. - You are insulting me.

01:28:51.539 --> 01:28:55.102
At the checkpoint, Barmin will go. "There's a gully behind the checkpoint, we've come from there.

01:28:55.182 --> 01:28:59.132
Probably from here will come the shitters. Only Bary is not enough.

01:28:59.212 --> 01:29:01.917
Give him a partner Vuk. He is a former detachment.

01:29:01.997 --> 01:29:03.902
Such, there are no "ex".

01:29:04.002 --> 01:29:08.086
The main one - do not worry, Vuk! We have to endure until the morning.

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:11.302
This is what you need. I need a Smoke.

01:29:11.382 --> 01:29:14.867
Vera is on the roof of the repair shop. From there everything is like a palm.

01:29:14.967 --> 01:29:18.445
This is the last place to look for the sniper.

01:29:33.503 --> 01:29:36.725
Vera, where are you?

01:29:37.056 --> 01:29:38.780
Yes, I am in the place.

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.597
If it gets too stuffy, we retire to dispatch.

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.442
Finally, will we make them a surprise?

01:29:55.806 --> 01:29:58.862
Around the gasoline is not smoked!

01:29:58.942 --> 01:30:01.257
Bary, if it's enough!

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:19.107
When we're done here, I'll take you to a concert.

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.447
It seemed like it was ...

01:30:30.527 --> 01:30:33.886
Can the girl stay with you in the dispatcher?

01:30:34.381 --> 01:30:37.287
As the most distant point?

01:30:39.545 --> 01:30:41.880
All right. - We're ready now.

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:44.064
Thanks.

01:30:54.531 --> 01:30:58.631
How do we hold on to this beauty?

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:09.489
Guys ... We have guests.

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:26.473
They have gone to intelligence. No one to show; sit quietly!

01:31:28.933 --> 01:31:32.263
If he came here, he would blow himself up on the straps.

01:31:32.343 --> 01:31:35.595
No ... will go through the checkpoint.

01:31:36.911 --> 01:31:39.037
Up to the checkpoint is, Barya.

01:31:39.117 --> 01:31:41.571
I see ...

01:31:57.933 --> 01:32:01.861
He is on the territory. We sit and wait.

01:32:09.372 --> 01:32:12.918
Where the hell are you, bastard?

01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:17.617
Turn around ... Turn the hell up!

01:32:27.992 --> 01:32:30.200
Lainzenze!

01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:07.709
That's bad!

01:33:17.696 --> 01:33:22.736
Children to send to intelligence.

01:33:27.621 --> 01:33:32.833
At war it is the worst move.

01:33:33.275 --> 01:33:40.136
And it is happening that the mujahedin give such a pimples an automatic,

01:33:40.461 --> 01:33:45.766
and say to him, "Go, fight!"

01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:54.548
Every time before a fight, please ...

01:33:54.948 --> 01:33:58.824
no children.

01:33:59.248 --> 01:34:02.189
Otherwise, end!

01:34:07.201 --> 01:34:12.182
Or take it like a trash ...

01:34:13.202 --> 01:34:17.192
or a bullet in the "pumpkin."

01:34:24.354 --> 01:34:27.447
It's working for you, Vuk ...

01:34:28.088 --> 01:34:33.768
War always breaks people ...

01:34:50.247 --> 01:34:54.783
What was that? - They checked.

01:34:54.863 --> 01:34:58.666
Whether here are professionals or ordinary thugs.

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.891
And what?

01:35:00.991 --> 01:35:05.319
The boy is alive - they are not thugs.

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:10.430
Listen, here's a lot of morphine. Maybe you will need it.

01:35:11.508 --> 01:35:13.508
Thanks.

01:35:16.257 --> 01:35:21.404
You will sit with my commander in the Dispatch Center. It's safest there.

01:35:21.504 --> 01:35:24.849
Beck will take care of you.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.329
Anyway ...

01:35:39.516 --> 01:35:41.557
And you?

01:35:43.576 --> 01:35:46.594
Not scary - I'm used to it.

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:49.845
What's your name? The real?

01:35:52.667 --> 01:35:56.285
Andrew. Shatalov.

01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:59.391
I like.

01:36:17.829 --> 01:36:21.214
Watch out, Andrew.

01:36:28.868 --> 01:36:33.117
Chatha ... Just jammed me in my throat.

01:36:49.429 --> 01:36:52.229
Dr. Colonel! We crossed the border between Bosnia and Serbia.

01:36:52.309 --> 01:36:55.004
We went exactly half way. - Excellent!

01:36:55.085 --> 01:36:58.238
Our NATO colleagues still think we are in the part.

01:36:58.339 --> 01:37:03.207
In Slatina we enter the dawn - confident, beautiful, powerful.

01:37:08.592 --> 01:37:13.205
So, brother ... Now there will be a historic battle!

01:37:13.707 --> 01:37:17.664
Russia and Serbia united.

01:37:18.226 --> 01:37:21.768
Have you been to Russia? - No...

01:37:23.043 --> 01:37:28.793
Milic was. Our commander. He sometimes told it.

01:37:29.024 --> 01:37:31.683
Good man ... it was.

01:37:31.763 --> 01:37:35.040
70 years old, and jumping like Chingaguch.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.886
He said, "We, with the Russians, are 200 million."

01:37:38.966 --> 01:37:41.508
No way. And without the Russians?

01:37:41.588 --> 01:37:43.857
Serbs will never shut down the Russians.

01:37:43.937 --> 01:37:47.999
Funny ... And with the Tatars? - What?

01:37:48.913 --> 01:37:52.547
How old are you with the Tatars?

01:37:52.914 --> 01:37:56.206
Who is it for the Tatars?

01:38:02.198 --> 01:38:05.337
But you're my Serb ...

01:38:05.437 --> 01:38:09.921
Eat it. Go to your position.

01:38:17.693 --> 01:38:21.410
What is Shaitan, how are you?

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:26.718
Well as in the old and good (times). "Only they were not good ..."

01:38:28.981 --> 01:38:33.044
Chatha ... I wanted to tell you then, but the situation was not right.

01:38:33.771 --> 01:38:38.257
Thank you for protecting me and throwing away that hell of a helicopter.

01:38:39.094 --> 01:38:42.781
You act as a true officer and commander.

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:59.570
I've long wanted to give it to you ...

01:39:03.705 --> 01:39:07.331
Kiriah ...

01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:14.966
The dispatch is my backpack. There's an address and money there.

01:39:15.066 --> 01:39:18.312
If anything happens - you'll be right on your own.

01:39:18.697 --> 01:39:22.491
Of course, there are no problems. "This is Kirj's address.

01:39:22.733 --> 01:39:25.412
To his family ...

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.735
His wife and daughter are alone ...

01:39:29.816 --> 01:39:32.955
After his death he did not even compensate them.

01:39:37.954 --> 01:39:41.579
It's not your fault.

01:39:44.099 --> 01:39:46.733
We will live!

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:42.866
Interesting is our "Russian" team.

01:40:42.966 --> 01:40:45.816
Tatar, Ingush, Belorussian, Serb ...

01:40:45.896 --> 01:40:48.715
Albanian, Uzbek ...

01:40:48.937 --> 01:40:54.283
Barry could not really understand what he was ... Only Shaitan is a Russian.

01:40:54.516 --> 01:40:58.537
Getting International!

01:40:58.637 --> 01:41:01.276
Go ahead! Tu-tu ...

01:41:01.834 --> 01:41:05.636
Bravo, Gereev, is on the air!

01:41:06.939 --> 01:41:11.680
I miss the Soviet time ... Then everything was different.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.903
Work is not in Soviet times. Just then you were young and beautiful,

01:41:14.983 --> 01:41:18.330
so do not start ... "" We just lived peacefully.

01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:20.878
Yes...

01:41:33.803 --> 01:41:36.406
It was - they started!

01:41:47.075 --> 01:41:50.228
They split into two groups; Barra, four of the column come to you!

01:41:50.308 --> 01:41:53.955
Meet them! - Vera, I accepted.

01:41:56.178 --> 01:41:59.641
No-no ... They do not have to know who's here.

01:41:59.721 --> 01:42:04.998
You know what Kosovo is for us? Let them see who is against them.

01:42:06.170 --> 01:42:08.450
A real Serb!

01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:13.869
When they see the beret, they'll shoot you first!

01:42:22.349 --> 01:42:24.967
C'mon, c'mon!

01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:46.920
For better times ...

01:42:48.065 --> 01:42:50.691
Go, go!

01:43:20.216 --> 01:43:22.407
Barya, Gerey and the Serb hold the terminal.

01:43:22.487 --> 01:43:26.509
I, Slash and Shatiy - the field. Vera, as always, hides our asses.

01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:29.940
With God ahead, boys, on my command!

01:43:31.315 --> 01:43:34.044
Bara, come on!

01:43:43.821 --> 01:43:47.926
Fadil, we finish the column! - Vuk, shoot right!

01:43:49.474 --> 01:43:52.119
We're acting!

01:44:26.306 --> 01:44:28.355
Gift ...

01:44:37.991 --> 01:44:40.033
Go!

01:44:47.153 --> 01:44:49.350
Let's pull off!

01:45:03.427 --> 01:45:05.781
Bary ...

01:45:09.190 --> 01:45:11.497
Do not Trouble ...

01:45:15.545 --> 01:45:17.722
Ready! - Bare, we're on our own ...

01:45:17.802 --> 01:45:20.255
Beck, we processed the column; we get out. Hold ...

01:45:20.355 --> 01:45:22.674
Accepted!

01:45:26.792 --> 01:45:29.268
We're downloading.

01:46:06.363 --> 01:46:10.476
And what, was that all? - Nothing can be seen...

01:46:12.451 --> 01:46:15.102
Gerey, report the situation!

01:46:17.003 --> 01:46:20.331
Did the boys die very quickly? - Yeah right...

01:46:20.431 --> 01:46:23.042
Too fast.

01:46:23.277 --> 01:46:26.297
Is the second group ready?

01:46:27.002 --> 01:46:29.549
It's ready. Waiting for order.

01:46:31.016 --> 01:46:33.804
Well, warrior ... how do you feel in the fight?

01:46:33.904 --> 01:46:37.215
Honestly? I thought there would be more.

01:46:37.315 --> 01:46:39.732
Do not be angry!

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.769
So, guys, do not relax. Open your eyes at four!

01:46:46.613 --> 01:46:50.083
Tell the second group to attack the terminal; remember the positions?

01:46:50.183 --> 01:46:53.079
Yes. - We're acting on the plan!

01:46:56.498 --> 01:47:00.114
I'm going to the terminal. Catch me!

01:47:05.347 --> 01:47:07.809
I see movement. The car is pointing to the terminal.

01:47:07.909 --> 01:47:10.241
You will remember, shit!

01:47:13.047 --> 01:47:15.677
Vera, will you be able to hit it?

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:19.193
Impossible, Chatha. - Gere, remove the target!

01:47:19.273 --> 01:47:20.816
Accepted!

01:47:20.896 --> 01:47:24.433
This is yours; will you?

01:47:36.875 --> 01:47:39.849
Cloak me, cover up!

01:47:43.265 --> 01:47:45.265
Fadil!

01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:48.510
He is ready!

01:48:13.608 --> 01:48:15.917
Gerey, what's wrong with you?

01:48:29.168 --> 01:48:32.676
Terminal, terminal take over! - Gera, hold on, come on!

01:48:34.094 --> 01:48:36.036
Come on come on!

01:48:36.116 --> 01:48:38.431
Move!

01:48:41.347 --> 01:48:43.485
Vuk, the terminal!

01:48:45.124 --> 01:48:47.640
Come on, complement ...

01:48:56.709 --> 01:49:02.063
Attention, we have guests in 1 hour! Chathai, Vera, Slash, fire in the direction of the road!

01:49:02.163 --> 01:49:04.793
I show ...

01:49:11.818 --> 01:49:14.782
Piece of cake!

01:49:27.465 --> 01:49:29.757
They killed me, Gerey ... they killed me!

01:49:29.857 --> 01:49:32.802
Kratko, Fadil, calmly. Hold on!

01:49:40.125 --> 01:49:42.669
You scream ... "" What? "

01:49:42.749 --> 01:49:44.623
Pee! - For what?

01:49:44.723 --> 01:49:46.732
Come on, fuck!

01:49:46.812 --> 01:49:49.993
Here we are very hard pressed. They try to get me.

01:50:05.751 --> 01:50:08.563
Is there blood in the urine? - No, no.

01:50:09.656 --> 01:50:12.241
Inject morphine!

01:50:12.368 --> 01:50:16.208
And bind! You will live, warrior!

01:50:28.672 --> 01:50:31.919
Now you're going to ... pander!

01:50:49.566 --> 01:50:54.021
Dogs ... Guys, I think there's plenty more here.

01:50:55.767 --> 01:50:58.636
Here we can not go.

01:50:59.915 --> 01:51:03.453
Amir, attack! Attack!

01:51:33.634 --> 01:51:36.563
Are they all alive?

01:51:37.972 --> 01:51:39.956
Shatiya: yes.

01:51:40.038 --> 01:51:41.501
Slash: yes.

01:51:41.581 --> 01:51:43.581
Barry and Vuk: yes.

01:51:44.887 --> 01:51:47.690
Vera: yes. - Gerey and Fadil: yes.

01:51:48.432 --> 01:51:52.373
Shaitan, wounded Vuk, Serb; but he behaves - beautifully!

01:51:52.499 --> 01:51:55.309
Where are the BTRs?

01:51:58.774 --> 01:52:02.663
Brazdnikov, be careful not to drop under the wheels!

01:52:04.482 --> 01:52:08.432
Can I go out too? "Where the hell are you going to do?"

01:52:08.532 --> 01:52:10.896
Well, look at the girls. - AHA...

01:52:10.976 --> 01:52:13.617
Drive more carefully. - Get out of the way, please.

01:52:13.697 --> 01:52:16.074
Thanks. Thanks. Get away, please.

01:52:16.154 --> 01:52:19.965
We're like our grandfathers in 1945. "" How many Russian flags do you have?

01:52:20.065 --> 01:52:23.180
They did not know we were going to arrive ...

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:25.529
They turned the Serbian.

01:52:27.973 --> 01:52:30.333
Thanks, we do not. Leave it for yourself.

01:52:30.413 --> 01:52:34.924
I'm a Voroshilski shooter! The Russians are our brothers!

01:52:35.024 --> 01:52:37.024
Brothers, brothers ...

01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:42.907
<i> With confidence, one can say: We are Russian military equipment before us. </ i></i>

01:52:42.987 --> 01:52:46.266
<i> June 12, 1999, 3 o'clock in the morning. </ i></i>

01:52:46.346 --> 01:52:49.646
<i> Morning will give us all the answers, and for now just watch. </ i></i>

01:52:49.726 --> 01:52:52.157
<i> The Russian Army in Pristina! </ i></i>

01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:59.648
Listen to Gerey, did the blonde hurt him a lot?

01:52:59.933 --> 01:53:03.247
He has not damaged his beauty.

01:53:03.332 --> 01:53:05.828
Are you angry?

01:53:05.939 --> 01:53:08.831
Come on, move faster!

01:53:08.931 --> 01:53:12.021
Put minometts fast!

01:53:23.738 --> 01:53:26.150
Quiet, quiet ... Do not cry.

01:53:28.488 --> 01:53:30.735
What is your name?

01:53:30.835 --> 01:53:33.751
Mila ... I want to Mom.

01:53:43.182 --> 01:53:46.610
It's quite quiet ... "" My ears are screaming!

01:53:46.878 --> 01:53:49.753
In a quiet pool devils are born!

01:53:49.833 --> 01:53:53.631
Guys, I can tear this silence with an excellent song!

01:53:53.711 --> 01:53:56.630
Better army rebels than your singing!

01:53:57.343 --> 01:54:00.499
Leave it! Squeeze the asses and do not relax!

01:54:00.579 --> 01:54:03.406
The holes are clenched ... In a dead grip!

01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:12.250
Guys, did you hear?

01:54:18.354 --> 01:54:20.582
Mini !!!

01:54:33.361 --> 01:54:35.438
Curves!

01:54:36.046 --> 01:54:38.801
Are you alive? - Let's go, go upstairs.

01:54:38.892 --> 01:54:41.822
Attention, change positions!

01:54:51.221 --> 01:54:54.043
Fadil, let's go missing!

01:55:05.118 --> 01:55:07.729
Vuk!

01:55:21.732 --> 01:55:23.732
Bend yourself! Down!

01:55:25.533 --> 01:55:28.968
Where is this child from?

01:55:29.135 --> 01:55:31.263
He says he does not know anything.

01:55:31.668 --> 01:55:34.516
Serbs, where do you get from here alone?

01:55:34.596 --> 01:55:37.600
Attention, we retreat to dispatching!

01:55:38.712 --> 01:55:40.713
Chatha: I accepted.

01:55:43.196 --> 01:55:45.470
Are you alive?

01:55:52.625 --> 01:55:55.111
Barra, retire, I'll cover you!

01:56:07.002 --> 01:56:10.392
We have to go, Gerey - they will start again.

01:56:16.927 --> 01:56:19.407
Go ... Go, Fadil.

01:56:19.956 --> 01:56:25.220
I'll just be here a bit ... - No, no, we're pulling together.

01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.299
Go!

01:56:27.399 --> 01:56:29.947
You need the boys.

01:56:31.602 --> 01:56:36.193
Friend ... Just give me the machine.

01:56:57.962 --> 01:57:00.267
Sorry, brother.

01:57:00.367 --> 01:57:03.463
It's all right, brother.

01:57:05.976 --> 01:57:09.500
Get down slowly, okay?

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.993
Go.

01:57:14.374 --> 01:57:16.730
Go.

01:57:59.226 --> 01:58:01.226
Gerey ...

01:58:01.791 --> 01:58:04.139
Geree!

01:58:05.908 --> 01:58:08.236
Geree!

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:16.907
Come on, brother, do not keep silent. - Commander ...

01:58:17.094 --> 01:58:19.851
Gerey died.

01:58:20.187 --> 01:58:22.800
Goodbye, Gere!

01:58:24.522 --> 01:58:27.479
Fuck him, where are ours?

01:58:35.849 --> 01:58:38.815
Come on, Barry.

01:58:45.072 --> 01:58:47.499
Fadil! "Where did you go, was it?"

01:58:48.436 --> 01:58:50.086
Where the fuck, shit ...

01:58:50.186 --> 01:58:52.780
Vera, 11!

01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:05.188
Well, come on ... Come on, come on!

01:59:09.193 --> 01:59:11.193
Fire!

01:59:13.155 --> 01:59:15.730
Oh, dog damn!

01:59:18.357 --> 01:59:21.863
Bare, cover me. I'm going to Vuk ... "" Shaitay, do not show out! "

01:59:23.265 --> 01:59:26.233
Chatha, the column I take; you can work!

01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:41.290
It's clean, you can start.

01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:43.390
Accepted, Vera. I work ...

01:59:43.869 --> 01:59:45.869
Vera, 3 hours!

01:59:57.185 --> 02:00:01.632
<i> Hot News from Kosovo: A Difficult Situation. </ i></i>

02:00:01.712 --> 02:00:04.787
<i> I spoke with my Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov. </ i></i>

<i> Russian troops are ordered immediately to leave Kosovo. </ i></i>

02:00:12.046 --> 02:00:14.046
Excellent!

General Somov listens. <i> A commandment from the President came: </ i></i>

02:00:25.303 --> 02:00:28.716
<i> "Urgently stop the column in Kosovo!" Run, Somov! </ I></i>

02:00:28.796 --> 02:00:32.072
I have never done cowardly orders!

02:00:32.172 --> 02:00:37.444
<i> The column will always be suspended. General, you buried yourself. </ i></i>

02:00:37.544 --> 02:00:40.634

Vera ... Vera!

02:00:58.623 --> 02:01:00.623
Vera, I accept, answer!

02:01:01.767 --> 02:01:04.237
Are you alive? Vera!

02:01:06.007 --> 02:01:10.259
Vera! - Guys, you need some help.

02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:13.614
I'm stuck. - Vera, do a little.

02:01:21.927 --> 02:01:24.557
Fire on the hangar! Remove the machine gun!

02:01:32.919 --> 02:01:35.257
Ladow on the phone! "Arbat is on the phone.

02:01:35.337 --> 02:01:39.230
Ataman, is ordered to stop the column and wait for further instructions.

02:01:39.330 --> 02:01:42.534
And how do you imagine it? - Run!

02:01:44.642 --> 02:01:46.642
Listen!

02:01:56.928 --> 02:01:59.728
Attention to everyone!

02:01:59.808 --> 02:02:02.727
I commend:

02:02:02.921 --> 02:02:06.377
Stop the movement.

02:02:09.942 --> 02:02:12.540
Why did we stop? - I do not know...

02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:15.973
We'll wait, we'll see.

02:02:20.549 --> 02:02:23.220
End. It is time...

02:02:25.312 --> 02:02:28.210
Seriega, why are you psychiatrist?

02:02:29.822 --> 02:02:32.383
We have not even reached ...

02:02:40.615 --> 02:02:42.952
We have to get ours off, okay. - Ah, I know ...

02:02:43.052 --> 02:02:46.666
But first, we need to solve the Minomet.

02:02:51.391 --> 02:02:53.759
What are you doing, Slash?

02:02:53.859 --> 02:02:55.852
I resolve the matter.

02:02:55.932 --> 02:02:59.439
Go ahead! Quick! Quick, to the hangars!

02:02:59.589 --> 02:03:02.394
Next, hold positions.

02:03:02.757 --> 02:03:05.334
I'm under fire. I can not disguise myself.

02:03:07.733 --> 02:03:09.451
We need help, Beck!

02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:12.983
They pressed us ... Vuk was 300 - seriously injured.

02:03:15.013 --> 02:03:18.114
I know you need help, I know ...

02:03:28.937 --> 02:03:30.483
Slash ...

02:03:30.563 --> 02:03:33.561
Sha'tai and Barya, Slash opposed the Minomet.

02:03:43.076 --> 02:03:46.623
God help you, they are lying!

02:03:48.935 --> 02:03:51.442
Dr. Colonel, Slatina is beyond the pass.

02:03:51.542 --> 02:03:54.066
We have to move, use the moment!

02:03:56.984 --> 02:03:58.984
Dr. Colonel ...

02:04:11.257 --> 02:04:14.322
We'll wait for the Minometts to finish.

02:04:35.237 --> 02:04:37.739
Truck, truck!

02:04:39.344 --> 02:04:41.636
Fire on the truck!

02:04:49.296 --> 02:04:50.967
Go!

02:04:51.047 --> 02:04:52.797
Hang on Illuah!

02:04:52.877 --> 02:04:54.877
Fire!

02:05:25.125 --> 02:05:26.497
Come on!

02:05:26.577 --> 02:05:29.332
Fire with buses!

02:05:43.899 --> 02:05:46.793
Jump, Illuah, come on!

02:05:51.454 --> 02:05:54.320
Come on, Illuah, jump!

02:06:01.374 --> 02:06:04.740
Piece of cake...

02:06:17.214 --> 02:06:20.646
See you, Slash ... I'll see you soon.

02:06:37.127 --> 02:06:40.155
How many people do we have?

02:06:41.575 --> 02:06:43.629
About 20.

02:06:48.031 --> 02:06:50.774
We have to save Vera. One tape left.

02:06:51.155 --> 02:06:54.525
The same thing - almost empty!

02:06:54.625 --> 02:06:57.494
<i> What are you doing with your Serb? </ i></i>

02:06:58.105 --> 02:07:00.835

<i> Shait! </ i></i>

<i> Such ... on the Serb - thank you! </ i></i>

02:07:43.226 --> 02:07:45.398
A real Serb.

02:07:46.556 --> 02:07:50.167
Boys, I will support the Serb! We're working on the last one!

02:08:10.133 --> 02:08:13.074
Kill him, fire! Fire!

02:08:19.638 --> 02:08:22.461
Sorry, brother.

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.200
I'm here!

02:08:34.107 --> 02:08:36.211
Chatha, I'm empty!

02:08:43.993 --> 02:08:46.526
Fuck him!

02:08:52.992 --> 02:08:55.682
Is not it "broken"? - We're working.

02:08:57.462 --> 02:08:59.462
Empty! They hit me.

02:09:03.384 --> 02:09:05.395
There 's a fly, ready to shoot. - Excellent!

02:09:05.475 --> 02:09:07.862
Prepare the "present".

02:09:15.483 --> 02:09:19.079
I'll be back soon. You hide. Did you understand me?

02:09:33.613 --> 02:09:36.094

Please, if you can hear me, please ...

Andrei, look at me.

02:10:19.941 --> 02:10:22.139
Everything is OK, do you hear?

02:10:22.219 --> 02:10:24.986
Listen to me, listen to me ...

02:10:25.758 --> 02:10:27.937
Come on, everything will be fine.

02:10:37.912 --> 02:10:42.832
Andrey ... look at me. Do not close your eyes, do you hear?

02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:53.394
Andrew!

02:10:53.474 --> 02:10:55.582
Please, please...

02:10:55.662 --> 02:10:58.385
Please do not die!

02:11:12.192 --> 02:11:14.772
Everyone is preparing to withdraw!

02:11:21.558 --> 02:11:23.566
We are withdrawing!

02:11:26.050 --> 02:11:28.050
Go!

02:11:37.043 --> 02:11:39.541
I'm empty! - Hang on!

02:11:43.707 --> 02:11:45.707

02:11:57.463 --> 02:11:59.603
I'm empty!

02:12:01.134 --> 02:12:04.016
What, Commander? Do you network yourself?

02:12:04.431 --> 02:12:05.618

Let's go! - Damn it!

02:12:56.328 --> 02:12:58.407
Smoke!

02:14:12.087 --> 02:14:13.961
I shot everything.

02:14:14.061 --> 02:14:16.061

02:14:22.392 --> 02:14:24.851
Four.

02:14:38.947 --> 02:14:42.055
What did he die for?

02:14:42.606 --> 02:14:47.776
For the family? He has no family.

02:14:47.876 --> 02:14:54.091
For the Motherland? This is my homeland!

02:14:54.358 --> 02:14:56.826
Gadini ...

02:14:57.075 --> 02:15:00.211
What did he die for?

02:15:00.291 --> 02:15:05.217
You have two minutes to leave!

02:15:05.881 --> 02:15:08.590
Do you hear me?

02:15:09.889 --> 02:15:13.052
Two minutes!

02:15:14.413 --> 02:15:17.377
I brought your friend.

02:15:17.457 --> 02:15:21.121
Get out to greet.

02:15:23.461 --> 02:15:26.751
You'll catch us another time!

02:15:27.275 --> 02:15:31.189
Do you have anything personal about yourself?

02:15:55.176 --> 02:15:58.764
What will we do with the civilians?

02:16:02.592 --> 02:16:04.651
It's a war ...

02:16:12.071 --> 02:16:15.651
Excuse me, Shaitan.

02:16:20.378 --> 02:16:22.750
Come on ... Get started from me.

02:17:24.475 --> 02:17:27.287
To be beautiful.

Are you ready?

02:17:31.761 --> 02:17:33.761
Ready.

02:19:47.668 --> 02:19:49.918

To the commander of the 1st Company: to provide security at the airport perimeter!

02:20:07.646 --> 02:20:12.110
Everything is fine. All ended.

02:20:14.352 --> 02:20:17.256
We are Russians ...

02:20:17.698 --> 02:20:22.270
Do you understand what I am telling you?

02:21:11.692 --> 02:21:15.450
Guys ... do what you want, but he does not have to land!

02:21:15.717 --> 02:21:18.722
We'll do it, Kolyan! - A ward, for a fight!

02:21:31.491 --> 02:21:36.030
Landing is impossible. Below there are some psyche on a Russian tank!

02:21:58.366 --> 02:22:01.372
Ward, fight!

02:22:07.936 --> 02:22:13.550
Sir, calm down. World War III will not start for you!

02:22:13.650 --> 02:22:15.650
Hurry!

02:22:20.985 --> 02:22:27.724

Yes she is...

What are you waiting for, man?

02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:23.790
There are things you can not tell just like that.

02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:28.891
There is nothing to tell. Go and act!
