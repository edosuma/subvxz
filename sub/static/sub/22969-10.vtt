00:00.880 --> 00:02.140
Where was the artifact found?

00:02.150 --> 00:03.480
La Brea Tar Pits.

00:03.480 --> 00:04.680
A volunteer at
the paleontology department

00:04.680 --> 00:06.410
uncovered it by accident.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.620
From the description of it,
sounds like the Osiris Stone,

00:08.620 --> 00:10.550
which has the power
to reanimate.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.490
Which explains
all the saber-toothed tigers

00:12.490 --> 00:13.820
running through
the streets of Los Angeles.

00:13.820 --> 00:14.960
Jenkins, we need a door!

00:14.960 --> 00:17.290
I grabbed some spears
from the weapons room.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.690
I found some nets. Gosh,
I hope they're big enough
for saber-toothed tigers.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.700
Make that woolly mammoths.
Someone just Instagrammed

00:21.700 --> 00:23.300
one of them crashing
into a tour bus.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.700
We're gonna need
bigger nets.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.100
- Jenkins?
- Coming!

00:26.100 --> 00:28.100
Jenkins, there you are.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.840
We need a door to the
La Brea Tar Pits, buddy, now.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.810
Yeah, sure.
One door coming up.

00:35.650 --> 00:37.250
Good luck, Librarians.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.630
Hmm.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.850
I don't think this is right.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.720
Hello.

01:19.620 --> 01:20.890
Anyone here?

01:33.170 --> 01:35.140
Jeff Peppers.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.660
Oh, my...

01:57.460 --> 01:59.930
Oh, my dear God.

01:59.930 --> 02:00.730
Jeff!

02:01.800 --> 02:03.200
What are you doing, Brad Pitt,

02:03.200 --> 02:04.400
staring at yourself?

02:04.400 --> 02:05.800
No, madame, um, you...

02:05.800 --> 02:07.470
You overslept again, Jeff.

02:07.470 --> 02:08.470
You gotta feed the babies.

02:08.470 --> 02:10.139
I'm not him.
He's not me.

02:10.139 --> 02:12.410
And, after you're done,
I've got a list of chores.

02:12.410 --> 02:15.210
I need you to fix that dish.
It's acting screwy.

02:15.210 --> 02:16.950
I thought we could watch
a "Wheel Of Fortune" later.

02:16.950 --> 02:18.810
Wait, madame, I beseech you
to listen to me.

02:18.820 --> 02:20.150
Something horrible
has happened...

02:20.150 --> 02:22.020
Well, something horrible
is about to happen

02:22.020 --> 02:24.290
if you don't get
up those stairs
and feed the babies.

02:24.290 --> 02:25.950
I will do no such thing...

02:25.960 --> 02:27.820
Feed the babies!
Feed the babies!

02:27.820 --> 02:29.820
- I will not feed your bab...
- Get up there.

02:29.830 --> 02:31.290
You know what your
responsibility is.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.300
- Listen... I know... I can't...
- Get in there.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.300
All right, don't forget
to clean all the litter boxes
and refill their bowls.

02:36.300 --> 02:40.770
The eyedropper for
poor little Tessie's pinkeye
is on the counter.

02:40.770 --> 02:44.510
Otto's got ringworm again,
so don't forget to give him
those suppositories.

02:45.910 --> 02:47.580
What are you waiting for?

02:47.580 --> 02:48.840
I...

02:49.980 --> 02:50.950
Uh...

02:53.850 --> 02:56.650
Soap, soap, soap!

02:56.650 --> 02:57.850
You want some breakfast?

02:57.850 --> 02:59.450
No, I've gotta get
to the library.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.190
Library?

03:01.190 --> 03:03.330
- But you hate reading,
- Is that his car?

03:03.330 --> 03:05.690
Jeff, what about my "Wheel"?
You promised you'd
fix the dish.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.870
Oh, God, what is that smell?

03:17.210 --> 03:19.410
Just... come on!

03:19.410 --> 03:20.380
Damn it.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.620
Yo, dude! Jeff!
Let's get a move on.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.220
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

03:29.220 --> 03:30.290
I am not...

03:30.290 --> 03:32.220
Never mind, just pl... go.
Go away, please.

03:32.220 --> 03:33.820
Hop in.
We're gonna be late for work.

03:33.820 --> 03:34.820
I'm not going to your work.

03:34.830 --> 03:37.090
Ooh, playing hooky.

03:37.090 --> 03:39.030
You gonna get
in so much trouble.

03:39.030 --> 03:40.360
- Just call in sick.
- It's what I do.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.560
Who's gonna know?

03:42.570 --> 03:44.500
Well, technically,
I'm the assistant manager,
so I'm supposed to report it.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.100
Dennis, please, I was talking.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.070
- Where you need to go, Jeff?
- Yeah, we'll drive you.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.980
Yes, fine. Take me
to St. John's Bridge.

03:54.980 --> 03:56.850
St. John's.
- Why, thinking
of jumping off?

03:56.850 --> 04:00.780
Not a bad idea right now.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.420
Want a Ring Pop?

04:04.720 --> 04:06.720
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.190
Stop! Stop!
Let me out of here.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.000
Okay, well,
we still on for later?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
- No.
- Cool. See you then.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.600
- Bye, Jeff.
- Feel better.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.399
He's not sick, Dennis!
God!

04:19.399 --> 04:20.700
Pump it!

04:25.880 --> 04:30.480
You, sir,
are one sexy stud muffin.

04:33.620 --> 04:35.750
Oh, wow.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.890
Mm, thank you, book.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.430
Thank you.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.640
Oh, hey! All right.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.040
The Librarians.
How was your adventure?

04:58.040 --> 04:59.770
Good. Went really well.
No thanks to you!

04:59.780 --> 05:01.310
You set the door
to a port-o-potty

05:01.310 --> 05:03.380
two feet from the Tar Pits.
We fell right in.

05:03.380 --> 05:04.910
Uh, this stuff
is really like sand.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.780
It gets everywhere,
and I mean everywhere!

05:06.780 --> 05:09.580
What's going on with you,
Jenkins? You never
make mistakes like that.

05:09.590 --> 05:11.450
Must've just had
a senior moment.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.890
But, hey,
at least the mission
went well, right?

05:16.730 --> 05:18.990
Uh, is that the artifact?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
The Osiris Stone...

05:21.000 --> 05:22.870
it's able to bring
the dead back to life.

05:22.870 --> 05:24.530
That is so rad.
Can I touch it?

05:24.540 --> 05:26.000
Sure.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.940
Awesome. Wow.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.340
You feeling all right, Jenkins?

05:30.340 --> 05:32.740
What? Uh, yeah.

05:32.740 --> 05:33.940
Yeah, no, never better.

05:33.940 --> 05:35.880
Yeah, just feeling like myself,

05:35.880 --> 05:37.080
you know, Jenkins.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.280
Jenkins being Jenkins.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.750
Aah! What the hell?

05:40.750 --> 05:42.220
Perimeter alarm.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.190
Someone's trying to get
into the library.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.290
Who is that?

05:48.290 --> 05:51.230
<i>Fingerprint not recognized.</i>

05:51.230 --> 05:53.700
- Damn it.
-<i>Voice pattern</i>
<i>not recognized.</i>

05:53.700 --> 05:55.460
Oh, just... shut up.

05:57.570 --> 05:58.830
Ah.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.570
Colonel? Colonel, it's me.
It's Jenkins!

06:03.570 --> 06:04.710
What's he doing?

06:04.710 --> 06:06.170
I mean, he's clearly insane.

06:06.180 --> 06:07.840
You gotta feel sorry
for him, don't ya?

06:07.840 --> 06:09.640
Looks like a sad sack.

06:09.650 --> 06:13.720
I don't know.
I feel like there's kind of
a rugged handsomeness to him.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.220
How...

06:16.790 --> 06:18.190
Ah.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.360
- Sorry. Need this.
- Hey!

06:23.390 --> 06:25.360
Jenkins.

06:27.060 --> 06:29.030
Oh, look.
He's writing something.

06:31.740 --> 06:32.800
- Hey! Whoa!
- What are you doing?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.470
Jeez!
Butterfingers, right?

06:34.470 --> 06:36.810
Well, we're done
with this guy anyway.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.410
Look, you've seen one
homeless guy on bath salts,
you've seen them all.

06:39.410 --> 06:42.280
Now, tell me all
about that mission.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.610
Can you see it?

06:44.620 --> 06:45.750
I'm Jenkins!

06:45.750 --> 06:47.450
I am...

06:49.220 --> 06:51.690
Jenkins.

06:51.690 --> 06:53.190
They don't know it's me.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.430
Jeff, where have you been?

06:59.430 --> 07:01.960
I just walked
from St. John's Bridge.

07:01.970 --> 07:04.170
Well, Lord,
that's over five miles away.

07:04.170 --> 07:05.630
Actually eleven.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.440
Well, now that you're back,

07:07.440 --> 07:09.500
the toilet's been acting
fussy again,

07:09.510 --> 07:12.170
and I had to miss both
"Wheel" and "Steve Harvey."

07:12.180 --> 07:14.980
Oh, and guess what?
We ran out of
Werther's Originals.

07:14.980 --> 07:16.310
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

07:16.310 --> 07:18.380
I'm going to search his room,

07:18.380 --> 07:20.720
try to figure out why...
how this happened.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.250
- Whose room?
- Uh, just...

07:22.250 --> 07:24.190
Wait, what about my
Werther's Originals, Jeff?

07:24.190 --> 07:27.990
Good grief, woman, don't you
have some wretched husband

07:27.990 --> 07:29.190
you can order about?

07:29.190 --> 07:31.530
How could you say
something like that?

07:31.530 --> 07:33.060
Do you think
it's been easy for me

07:33.060 --> 07:34.800
living without your father?

07:34.800 --> 07:38.370
His cancer
just about destroyed me.

07:41.470 --> 07:42.470
I'm sorry.

07:42.470 --> 07:45.070
I miss him so much.

07:46.410 --> 07:47.480
Right.

07:48.810 --> 07:51.280
Excuse me.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.420
Read it.
People just inform themselves.

07:54.420 --> 07:55.620
- You're a dork.
- Actually, you're a dork.

07:55.620 --> 07:56.890
- Hey, Jeff!
- Hey, Jeff.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.090
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

07:58.090 --> 07:59.960
You ready to play?
We said after work.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.490
I got Ring Pops.

08:01.490 --> 08:02.760
Leave me alone, please.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.030
- What about the game?
- Yeah.

08:04.030 --> 08:05.690
So last we left off,

08:05.700 --> 08:08.430
we were about
to enter the catacombs
of the demon king

08:08.430 --> 08:10.300
to find the golden treasure.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.570
Jeff, D&D, we're waiting.

08:12.570 --> 08:15.040
Excuse me, please.
For the last time,
leave me be.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.770
I do not want to play
your stupid game.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.280
Well, Jenkins is out.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.780
Guess it's just you
and me, Jacob Stone.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.710
Quite right, Cassandra Cillian.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.980
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
you know about the Librarians?

08:28.990 --> 08:31.590
God, what is wrong with you?
He is seriously mental today.

08:31.590 --> 08:32.990
They're our D&D characters.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.059
We got Cassandra the Sorceress,

08:35.059 --> 08:36.190
Stone the Ranger.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.659
Baird the Warrior Princess.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.390
Flynn the Wise Sage.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.460
And Mr. Jones?

08:40.460 --> 08:42.530
Ezekiel the Cunning Thief.

08:42.530 --> 08:45.400
Sadly, he got eaten
by a tenth-level Orc

08:45.400 --> 08:46.470
a few weeks ago.

08:46.470 --> 08:47.740
How do you know about them?

08:47.740 --> 08:49.070
Dude, because of you.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.410
You're, like,
obsessed with them.

08:50.410 --> 08:51.740
Did you forget your shrine?

08:54.750 --> 08:56.310
What?

08:59.480 --> 09:01.150
You know,
I'm still on the fence

09:01.150 --> 09:03.080
about whether
they're real or not.

09:03.090 --> 09:04.690
- Librarians?
- Of course they are.

09:04.690 --> 09:06.620
What about all those DOSA files
that Wikileaks dumped?

09:06.620 --> 09:08.420
Oh, or those articles
by what's-her-name,

09:08.430 --> 09:09.560
the reporter.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.890
- Sarina Bhonsle.
- Yes.

09:10.890 --> 09:12.030
- She retracted them.
- What?

09:12.030 --> 09:13.090
She took them all back.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.360
Or she was forced to.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.170
Conspiracy.

09:16.170 --> 09:18.100
- You had me at conspiracy.
- Oh, my God.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.100
I'm, uh...

09:21.100 --> 09:23.040
really obsessed
with Jenkins, huh?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.640
Big time.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.240
You said Jenkins is like
an immortal knight of Camelot.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.380
Percival, I think.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.240
No, Lancelot.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.910
- Galahad.
- Galahad!

09:30.910 --> 09:33.720
Who would want to be Galahad?
Arthur is way cooler.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.490
So he switched bodies
with me on purpose.

09:39.790 --> 09:42.460
The enemy is
at the castle gates.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.130
To battle!

09:51.540 --> 09:53.870
Your skills are impressive,
Black Knight.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.570
Can you handle this?

09:57.740 --> 09:59.670
I meant to do that.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.880
Yeah, you know,
I meant to do that.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.020
Hey, Cassandra.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.350
Sassy Cassie.

10:09.350 --> 10:10.550
How you doing?

10:10.550 --> 10:11.550
I'm good.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.960
Uh, I guess I just...
Jenkins, I need to...

10:13.960 --> 10:15.160
Ah, ah, ah, whoa, hey.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.330
Hold that thought.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.130
Water...

10:20.700 --> 10:21.600
into wine.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.170
Ha! How sick is that, right?

10:26.170 --> 10:28.170
You want a pull?

10:28.170 --> 10:30.140
- No, I'm good.
- Cool. More for me.

10:31.910 --> 10:34.440
Ah, so... what's up?

10:34.450 --> 10:38.310
I mean, to what do I owe
this splendiferous pleasure,
Miss Cillian?

10:38.320 --> 10:41.380
Um, I... I found this book
in the Annex,

10:41.380 --> 10:43.120
and I've never seen it before,

10:43.120 --> 10:44.250
and I can't find a file on it.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.650
Oh, yeah, no, that's, um...

10:45.660 --> 10:47.190
that's 'cause it's
a new acquisition.

10:47.190 --> 10:48.920
Yeah, from the s...

10:48.930 --> 10:50.790
...department.

10:50.790 --> 10:52.730
- Oh.
- I was just about
to file it away,

10:52.730 --> 10:55.900
so don't you worry
your pretty little
red head about it.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.530
Okay. Great.

10:59.540 --> 11:00.740
Hey, um...

11:00.740 --> 11:02.800
I was just thinking,

11:02.810 --> 11:04.140
if you weren't busy later,

11:04.140 --> 11:05.270
you and me could go out

11:05.280 --> 11:07.740
and double straw a margarita,

11:07.750 --> 11:09.480
maybe talk about magic,

11:09.480 --> 11:13.210
maybe... make some magic.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.420
Excuse me?

11:14.420 --> 11:15.950
What? No, nothing.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.020
- No.
- No, no, I just...

11:17.020 --> 11:18.020
- Yeah.
- Just kidding.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.550
Right.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.220
- Yeah...
- Uh, I am going
to put this puppy back

11:22.230 --> 11:23.890
and, yeah, good talk.

11:23.890 --> 11:25.630
Great. Okay.

11:25.630 --> 11:28.900
Yeah, Stoner, my man.

11:30.570 --> 11:32.170
Do you think...
Do... Do you think

11:32.170 --> 11:35.040
there's something off
about Jenkins?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.110
- 'Cause...
- Maybe.

11:36.110 --> 11:37.110
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:37.110 --> 11:38.510
- Mm-hmm.
- He did ask me earlier

11:38.510 --> 11:40.110
if Baird was seeing anyone.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.710
- Oh.
- I just figured it was a...

11:41.710 --> 11:44.380
like a byproduct of him
dealing with mortality

11:44.380 --> 11:47.920
or a delayed,
delayed mid-life crisis.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.320
Right.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.190
Hiding place, hiding place.

11:52.190 --> 11:54.920
Oh. Oh.

11:54.930 --> 11:56.790
Ugh.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.560
Gross.

12:04.070 --> 12:05.270
Rats... skitter, skitter.

12:05.270 --> 12:06.670
Bats... flying, flying, flying.

12:06.670 --> 12:09.140
You make your way down
the castle catacombs,

12:09.140 --> 12:11.140
slime oozing down the walls.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.940
Suddenly you come across
a wooden door.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.280
What do you do?

12:14.280 --> 12:15.540
- We open the door.
- This is ridiculous.

12:15.550 --> 12:17.750
It creaks open... Cree-eak...

12:17.750 --> 12:20.550
revealing a glistening mound
of treasure.

12:20.550 --> 12:22.350
But it is being guarded

12:22.350 --> 12:25.020
by a great ten-foot tall
cave troll.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.960
Have I been acting odd lately?

12:26.960 --> 12:29.290
- Have I come into contact
with anything?
- The cave troll

12:29.290 --> 12:31.090
opens its great mouth,

12:31.090 --> 12:33.030
blood dripping from its fangs.

12:33.030 --> 12:34.160
What do you do?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.630
Attack!

12:35.630 --> 12:37.600
- Roll for initiative.
- Ooh, yeah.

12:39.170 --> 12:41.700
Roll for initiative.

12:47.710 --> 12:49.440
Ha! Cassandra the Sorceress
goes first.

12:49.450 --> 12:51.780
I cast fireball at the troll.

12:51.780 --> 12:53.850
Oh, completely ineffective.
Does not work at all.

12:53.850 --> 12:55.650
- What?
- What? She just rolled at 19.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.920
The cave troll is wearing
a fire resistance ring,

12:58.920 --> 13:00.390
so it's immune to fireballs.

13:00.390 --> 13:01.520
Dude, always the fire rings.
It's the third campaign...

13:02.930 --> 13:04.790
Who makes up this...
Listen to me.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.460
First of all, do you realize
how full this game is

13:07.460 --> 13:09.930
of just inaccuracies
and misinformation?

13:09.930 --> 13:13.270
Um, my fifth edition
Monster Manual begs to differ.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.740
Yes, that is not...

13:15.740 --> 13:17.670
First,
no self-respecting castle

13:17.670 --> 13:19.140
will hide its treasure

13:19.140 --> 13:20.340
behind an unlocked wooden door.

13:20.340 --> 13:21.680
That's just amateur hour.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.210
And anybody that's anybody

13:23.210 --> 13:25.350
knows that cave trolls
don't have fangs.

13:25.350 --> 13:28.550
They have tusks.
Oh, and a fireball spell?

13:28.550 --> 13:31.420
Do you realize
how long it takes
to conjure one of those?

13:31.420 --> 13:35.960
Days. A paralysis spell
works in half the time
and is just as effective.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.090
People, if we're gonna do it,
let's do it right.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.830
I think he needs to be
the Dungeon Master.

13:39.830 --> 13:42.300
No! Not this again.
I'm the Dungeon Master!

13:42.300 --> 13:44.100
Dude, that was incredible.
He had the paralysis...

13:44.100 --> 13:45.500
Listen. Wait, wait.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.040
Is this what you do
with your days,

13:47.040 --> 13:48.570
just sit in this cellar
and play this game?

13:48.570 --> 13:51.510
What is wrong with you?

13:51.510 --> 13:53.840
Dude, you've been acting
like a total psycho.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.450
- Yeah, ever since
you found that book.
- I...

13:57.450 --> 13:59.050
Book? What book?

13:59.050 --> 14:01.180
Seriously,
do you not remember
a single thing?

14:01.180 --> 14:02.250
Did you get hit in the head?

14:02.250 --> 14:03.650
Yeah, really hard.
What book?

14:03.650 --> 14:05.790
The one you got online
from the rare bookshop

14:05.790 --> 14:07.320
that was being liquidated.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.060
You wouldn't
stop talking about it.

14:09.060 --> 14:11.330
You kept on saying
how it would make a kick-ass
monster manual.

14:11.330 --> 14:13.930
It looked a little bit strange
to be a monster manual,
if you ask me.

14:13.930 --> 14:15.330
Wait, wait,
what did it look like?

14:15.330 --> 14:17.470
- I can probably look it up.
- What?

14:17.470 --> 14:20.470
One second. Ah!

14:24.610 --> 14:26.610
That's no monster manual.

14:26.610 --> 14:29.010
That's the Asmodeus Grimoire.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.910
It's the most dangerous book
in the world.

14:38.890 --> 14:39.690
<i>Asmodeus Grimoire?</i>

14:39.690 --> 14:41.420
<i>Jeff, what are you
talking about?</i>

14:41.430 --> 14:43.490
He bought the book.
He didn't know what it was.

14:43.490 --> 14:44.830
Then he found out what it was,

14:44.830 --> 14:46.630
and he used it
to exchange places with me,

14:46.630 --> 14:48.630
not understanding
the consequences.

14:48.630 --> 14:49.770
Jeff, you're scaring me.

14:49.770 --> 14:51.430
I've gotta break
into the Library,

14:51.440 --> 14:52.970
find the book if he still has...

14:52.970 --> 14:55.370
how do I break into the Library?

14:55.370 --> 14:58.110
Oh. Secret entrances.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.370
I can't do that without help.

14:59.380 --> 15:00.510
I've got to...

15:03.780 --> 15:05.050
Get up. Let's go.

15:05.050 --> 15:06.450
- What?
- Let's go.

15:06.450 --> 15:07.650
Up. Out. Mush.

15:07.650 --> 15:08.850
- Where are we going?
- Just go.

15:08.850 --> 15:10.790
- What about the game?
- Don't worry about it.

15:10.790 --> 15:12.920
I promised my wife
I was gonna stop at
the Bed, Bath, & Beyond.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.260
Yes, yes.
I don't know what that is,
but it's gonna have to wait.

15:15.260 --> 15:17.530
Come on. Go. Go.
Get in the car.

15:17.530 --> 15:19.390
Jeff, please.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.730
I'm not going
another step further

15:20.730 --> 15:22.330
until you tell us
what's going on.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.800
Yeah! And what about the game?

15:23.800 --> 15:28.600
Okay, this is going to sound
ludicrous to you, but...

15:30.340 --> 15:32.210
I'm not your friend Jeff.

15:32.210 --> 15:34.410
I am in reality Jenkins,

15:34.410 --> 15:36.680
also known as Galahad,
Knight of Camelot,

15:36.680 --> 15:39.010
and Caretaker
to the magical Library,

15:39.020 --> 15:40.680
which happens to be real.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.150
The book that your friend bought

15:42.150 --> 15:44.150
was not a toy, nor a fake.

15:44.150 --> 15:45.890
It was an authentic spellbook

15:45.890 --> 15:50.360
which he used
to exchange bodies with me,

15:50.360 --> 15:51.830
apparently because
he was obsessed with me,

15:51.830 --> 15:55.430
but when he did so,
he also unknowingly

15:55.430 --> 15:59.500
released very powerful
evil forces

15:59.500 --> 16:02.370
that could wreak havoc,

16:02.370 --> 16:05.510
and we must stop it
before it's too late.

16:07.310 --> 16:08.510
- Okay.
- Makes sense.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.780
- Totally.
- That's it?

16:10.780 --> 16:13.580
No... "That's the craziest
thing we've ever heard, dude"?

16:13.580 --> 16:15.450
Yeah. No, we figured something
like this was going on.

16:15.450 --> 16:17.120
Yeah, it's just like
that D&D module,

16:17.120 --> 16:19.050
"The Sinister
Body Snatchers of Boldovia."

16:19.060 --> 16:20.660
When do we start?

16:22.390 --> 16:24.990
Uh, now.
Let's start now.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.660
Front entrance to the Library
is impenetrable,

16:27.670 --> 16:30.470
protected by
an elaborate security system.

16:30.470 --> 16:32.200
There is, however, a back door,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.800
but to gain access to it,

16:33.800 --> 16:36.140
one must first pass
through a series

16:36.140 --> 16:37.410
of booby-trapped chambers,

16:37.410 --> 16:39.680
each more deadly than the last.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.410
If you know so much about it,

16:41.410 --> 16:42.740
why can't you just waltz in?

16:42.750 --> 16:44.550
Yeah, why do you need us?

16:44.550 --> 16:46.150
Because the chambers
were designed

16:46.150 --> 16:47.420
to prevent a single individual

16:47.420 --> 16:48.550
from gaining access.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.550
It takes teamwork.

16:50.820 --> 16:52.420
But you know about
the booby traps, right?

16:52.420 --> 16:54.160
You can get us past
the booby traps.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.160
No, the chambers are
constantly self-reconfiguring,

16:57.160 --> 16:59.830
the puzzles inside,
chosen by the Library itself.

16:59.830 --> 17:01.630
I have no idea what we'll face.

17:01.630 --> 17:04.099
- Wow.
- All of you must help me

17:04.099 --> 17:05.369
get to the back door.

17:05.369 --> 17:06.569
In order to do this,

17:06.569 --> 17:07.770
you must be trained

17:07.770 --> 17:09.300
in the way of the Librarians.

17:09.310 --> 17:11.569
You must become greater
than yourselves.

17:11.579 --> 17:13.780
You're going to turn us
into Librarians?

17:13.780 --> 17:16.040
No, that would take a miracle.

17:16.050 --> 17:17.310
Let's begin.

17:23.650 --> 17:26.920
A Librarian must make
friends with danger,

17:26.920 --> 17:29.390
must learn to fight
with his, or her,

17:29.390 --> 17:31.730
body and mind.

17:42.810 --> 17:44.940
A Librarian
is more than a person.

17:44.940 --> 17:48.280
A Librarian is a shining beacon,

17:48.280 --> 17:52.680
reminding us of the best
humanity has to offer.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.880
Everything hurts.

17:54.890 --> 17:57.490
Why did you make us do that?

17:57.490 --> 17:59.560
- That was grueling.
- Hmm.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.560
What are you doing over there?

18:01.560 --> 18:03.090
Yeah, come on.
Join us.

18:03.090 --> 18:06.490
Have some of my famous
home-brewed mead.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.430
It's cheap wine mixed
with Shasta cola.

18:09.430 --> 18:11.030
- Ignore her.
- It's so good.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.170
You'll love it.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.500
It's been a very long time

18:14.500 --> 18:17.670
since I partook in spirits.
Hmm?

18:18.980 --> 18:20.210
Good stuff, huh?

18:24.650 --> 18:25.710
No, not at all.

18:28.190 --> 18:32.990
So are you honestly
gonna sit there and not
tell us about Camelot?

18:32.990 --> 18:35.790
We're D&D nerds. Spill.

18:35.790 --> 18:38.190
Come on, what was Arthur like?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.390
Bossy.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.800
A bit vain, but a good king.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.530
Was Merlin as cool
as we think he is?

18:44.530 --> 18:46.670
- Cooler than you can imagine.
- Aww!

18:46.670 --> 18:49.070
To be a Knight
of the Round Table.

18:49.070 --> 18:51.010
I bet it was a lot like this,
right?

18:51.010 --> 18:54.340
Just sitting around,
drinking mead,

18:54.340 --> 18:55.880
telling tales of glory.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.410
Well, I don't know
so much about that.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.480
I stayed to myself a lot.

19:01.490 --> 19:02.820
But you're Galahad,

19:02.820 --> 19:04.490
the finder of the Holy Grail,

19:04.490 --> 19:05.620
nicknamed
the "Perfect Knight."

19:05.620 --> 19:08.360
But also the illegitimate son
of Lancelot,

19:08.360 --> 19:09.960
not of true noble birth.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.490
I always felt different
than the others,

19:11.500 --> 19:13.090
even after joining the Library.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.970
I'm neither Librarian
nor Guardian.

19:16.970 --> 19:18.370
It's...

19:18.370 --> 19:21.570
sort of on the outside
looking in.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.110
I know what
you're talking about.

19:24.110 --> 19:25.510
I grew up an Army brat,

19:25.510 --> 19:28.040
so we moved eight times
in 12 years.

19:28.050 --> 19:32.180
I never lived a single place
long enough to call home.

19:32.180 --> 19:34.780
You had it lucky.
I would've killed to move.

19:34.780 --> 19:35.980
Beats sticking around,
being picked on

19:35.990 --> 19:37.450
by all the beautiful people.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.060
Try dealing with a family
of overachievers.

19:40.060 --> 19:42.460
Do you know what it was like
during Thanksgiving?

19:42.460 --> 19:43.990
I was invisible.

19:43.990 --> 19:47.400
To the outcasts.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.000
Long may they reign.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.200
Huzzah.

19:53.340 --> 19:55.340
I will never drink wine
and Shasta again,

19:55.340 --> 19:56.600
that's for sure.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.270
Do you guys think
this is too much?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.010
- Maybe I should go home
and change Ag...
- No, stop it.

20:00.010 --> 20:01.410
You've already changed twice.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.940
No, no, no, no, honey.
We shouldn't be late.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.210
I'm just gonna break
into the Magical Castle and...

20:04.210 --> 20:06.550
Hang up!

20:06.550 --> 20:08.850
We need to focus.

20:17.430 --> 20:21.500
Come. We have to enter
here to gain access
to the underground chambers.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.700
Where? The tree?

20:26.840 --> 20:28.570
Run directly into it.

20:28.570 --> 20:29.840
It will transport you there.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.310
It's an invisible door,

20:31.310 --> 20:33.310
just like the train station
in Harry Potter.

20:33.310 --> 20:34.980
Love it.

20:34.980 --> 20:35.980
Now that...

20:35.980 --> 20:36.850
Uh!

20:36.850 --> 20:38.850
Aurora, are you okay?

20:38.850 --> 20:42.250
Please tell me one of you guys
got a picture of that.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.390
That was awesome!

20:43.390 --> 20:47.590
The entrance is here.

20:47.590 --> 20:49.530
Get behind me.

20:49.530 --> 20:50.890
Follow me in.

20:52.530 --> 20:55.860
Now that was awesome.

20:55.870 --> 20:59.670
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Oh, my God!

21:03.940 --> 21:06.710
The door down there will
take us to the second chamber.

21:11.420 --> 21:15.350
Tell me that did not just
come up out of the floor.

21:15.350 --> 21:20.290
Interlocking pieces,
like part of a jigsaw puzzle.

21:20.290 --> 21:23.090
So if we solve it,
then we can cross.
Awesome.

21:23.090 --> 21:24.890
Oh, well, I know puzzles
'cause I do them

21:24.900 --> 21:25.960
- with my kids all the time.
- Wait! Don't...

21:28.900 --> 21:30.630
What was that? What was that?
What was that?

21:30.630 --> 21:33.440
You set off
one of the booby traps.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.040
- Sorry.
- Each wrong move

21:35.040 --> 21:37.840
makes the chamber collapse
a little more.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.140
What are we gonna do now?

21:52.460 --> 21:55.460
- Awesome.
- Hello, Jenkins.

21:55.460 --> 22:00.800
Oh, well, if it isn't
my favorite math whiz/
synesthete/tumor survivor.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.400
What's happenin', Red?

22:02.400 --> 22:05.530
I just found this scroll
I need translated
for an upcoming mission.

22:05.540 --> 22:08.340
I couldn't find Stone,
so I thought maybe you
could help me.

22:08.340 --> 22:11.210
You w...
you want me to
Tran... translate?

22:11.210 --> 22:13.940
Yeah.
It's just a mix of Sumerian

22:13.940 --> 22:16.750
and seventh-century
archaic Latin.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.610
Should be a breeze for you.
After all, you are Jenkins.

22:19.620 --> 22:20.950
Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah.

22:20.950 --> 22:23.820
Uh-huh, what... Did you...
Did you hear that?

22:23.820 --> 22:25.290
Did you hear someone
calling for me?

22:25.290 --> 22:27.090
I think I heard...
Yeah, I'll be right there!

22:27.090 --> 22:29.290
Translate the scroll, Jenkins.

22:29.290 --> 22:31.830
Oh, sure.
Yeah, not a problem.
Not a problem.

22:33.430 --> 22:34.900
Boy, they...

22:34.900 --> 22:37.430
sure make the font small
on these things, huh?

22:37.430 --> 22:39.030
Okay. Um,

22:39.040 --> 22:43.970
inter-way... is-yay...
oming-cay.

22:43.970 --> 22:45.770
- Pig Latin.
- I knew it.

22:45.780 --> 22:47.380
- I knew you were a fake.
- What did you do
with Jenkins?

22:47.380 --> 22:48.510
Oh, please don't hurt me.

22:48.510 --> 22:50.380
Tell us or we feed you
to Nessie.

22:50.380 --> 22:53.780
No, please.
Wait, the Loch Ness
Monster's here?

22:53.780 --> 22:56.190
- Start talking.
- Okay, all right.

22:56.190 --> 22:58.050
Um, um, uh-uh...

22:58.060 --> 22:59.990
Okay, my name is Jeff Peppers.

22:59.990 --> 23:01.990
I'm a 28-year-old tech
from Circuit Town.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.590
I found a book with magic in it,

23:03.590 --> 23:05.060
and I used it to swap
places with Jenkins.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.930
That's the book
I was telling you about.

23:06.930 --> 23:08.200
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.800
I just wanted to...

23:09.800 --> 23:11.330
rent him for a little while.

23:11.330 --> 23:13.130
You know, honestly,
I'm a really good guy.

23:13.140 --> 23:14.870
If you guys ever find yourself
out by Circuit Town,

23:14.870 --> 23:16.210
pop on in.
I'll give you a discount.

23:16.210 --> 23:18.340
Well, on anything
other than Apple products

23:18.340 --> 23:19.810
'cause, you know,
they don't really give me
that kind of pull...

23:19.810 --> 23:22.410
Where's this book?

23:22.410 --> 23:23.810
It's just over here.

23:23.810 --> 23:25.610
I hid it underneath
one of your end tables,

23:25.620 --> 23:27.280
which are beautiful, by the way.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.750
Just show us the book.

23:28.750 --> 23:32.020
Yeah, no, there it is.
See? No harm, no foul.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.490
What is that?
Are those hoof prints?

23:49.110 --> 23:51.170
We've been staring
at this forever.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.970
There has to be a way
to figure this out.

23:52.980 --> 23:55.480
- Well...
- I know this.

23:56.910 --> 23:58.910
- Uh...
- Schmidt, what are you doing?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.050
Yeah, man, don't play around.

24:00.050 --> 24:03.250
Twenty pieces, each a triangle.

24:03.250 --> 24:06.920
Twenty pieces.
Twenty triangles.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.720
Mr. Schmidt,
we cannot afford
any mistakes.

24:08.730 --> 24:11.160
Trust me, guys.
I got this.

24:28.410 --> 24:31.210
It's an icosahedron.
How did you know that?

24:31.210 --> 24:35.080
It's the one shape every
D&D player in the world knows.

24:35.090 --> 24:38.620
20-sided die.
Roll for initiative, bitches.

24:38.620 --> 24:41.020
- That was awesome!
- Dragon's fire, bro!

24:41.020 --> 24:42.990
Dungeon Master, bro!

24:44.830 --> 24:46.800
Mr. Schmidt.

24:49.370 --> 24:51.700
Now, we have to turn these dials

24:51.700 --> 24:54.100
exactly at the same time.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.570
One, two, three.

25:17.130 --> 25:18.790
This one looks fun.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.330
Oh, God! What is that?

25:21.330 --> 25:24.670
Stop, stop, stop.
Just stop.

25:24.670 --> 25:26.000
Past intruders in the Library.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.940
Many have tried.
None have succeeded.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.340
Let's get
out of this chamber quick.

25:32.010 --> 25:36.480
Would you please stop
setting off booby traps?

25:36.480 --> 25:40.150
What is wrong with you?
Have you not seen
Last Crusade"?

25:40.150 --> 25:41.880
Oh, is that the one
with Shia LaBeouf?

25:41.890 --> 25:43.350
No, Dennis!

25:43.350 --> 25:46.490
- Gimme that boom.
- Excuse me?

25:46.490 --> 25:49.160
The tiles. It's just like
"Dance Dance Revolution."

25:49.160 --> 25:51.960
- What?
- It's this stupid
dancing game

25:51.960 --> 25:54.360
where you step on glowing tiles

25:54.370 --> 25:56.170
that match a pattern.

25:56.170 --> 25:58.300
These tiles are glowing
in a repeating pattern,

25:58.300 --> 26:00.240
just like the song,
"Gimme That Boom."

26:00.240 --> 26:01.240
Watch.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.510
<i>♪ Gimme that boom,
boom, boom ♪</i>

26:08.510 --> 26:10.710
<i>♪ Gimme that boom, boom, boom</i>

26:10.710 --> 26:13.980
Holy roly poly, it's working.

26:13.980 --> 26:16.190
Come on.

26:16.190 --> 26:18.790
<i>♪ Gimme that boom,
boom, boom ♪</i>

26:18.790 --> 26:21.720
<i>♪ Gimme that boom,
boom, boom ♪</i>

26:21.730 --> 26:23.990
<i>♪ Bang it with the bottom,
gonna make ya move ♪</i>

26:23.990 --> 26:25.260
Come on, Jenkins, dance.

26:25.260 --> 26:27.730
- No.
- But you'll die!

26:27.730 --> 26:29.260
Much preferred.
Thank you.

26:29.270 --> 26:31.400
Jenkins, you'll never get
your body back.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.540
<i>♪ Gimme that,
gimme that, gimme that ♪</i>

26:34.540 --> 26:38.140
<i>♪ That, that boom,

26:38.140 --> 26:41.340
<i>♪ We get dressed up,

26:41.340 --> 26:43.280
Go, Jenkins!
It's your birthday!

26:43.280 --> 26:45.150
- Go, Jenkins!
- Come on, Jenkins!

26:45.150 --> 26:47.550
♪<i>I can't stop this... ♪</i>

26:48.750 --> 26:49.950
Way to go, Sir Jenkins.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.350
Well done. Well done.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.820
But any of you
ever mention this,

26:55.830 --> 26:57.030
I will end you.

26:57.030 --> 26:58.990
- Okay.
- Understood.

27:02.300 --> 27:06.000
Aurora.
Now, just like before.

27:09.710 --> 27:12.240
- Whoa.
- Where are we?

27:12.240 --> 27:15.110
If this is the final chamber,
then where's the door?

27:15.110 --> 27:17.450
Maybe we did something wrong.

27:17.450 --> 27:20.120
Maybe we're in a dream,

27:20.120 --> 27:23.120
like inside the dream of
some giant sentient creature,

27:23.120 --> 27:25.790
and when he wakes up,
we'll wake up.

27:25.790 --> 27:26.990
Or we're in limbo,

27:26.990 --> 27:28.390
and we got
in a huge car accident

27:28.390 --> 27:29.860
on the way here,
and we all just died.

27:29.860 --> 27:32.260
- Or...
- Please, please, be quiet.

27:32.260 --> 27:33.930
I'm trying to concentrate.

27:33.930 --> 27:36.130
Don't worry, Sir Jenkins.
We will find a way out of here.

27:36.130 --> 27:37.800
Oh, God, I don't think so.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.870
I don't think we can dance
our way out of this one.

27:39.870 --> 27:41.740
Hey, she's just trying
to be positive.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.470
I was an idiot thinking
I could train you
as Librarians.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.470
It's impossible!

27:45.480 --> 27:48.010
And now here we are.
We're stuck.

27:48.010 --> 27:49.010
Stuck in this room.

27:49.010 --> 27:51.080
I am stuck in this body.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.550
It's no use.

27:53.550 --> 27:54.680
Oh, God.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.220
It's...

27:56.220 --> 28:00.760
Hopeless. It's hopeless.

28:07.630 --> 28:08.600
Mr. Jenkins.

28:11.370 --> 28:13.370
There's this bedtime story
I often tell my kids.

28:13.370 --> 28:14.300
Oh, God.

28:14.310 --> 28:16.570
It... It's about a bunny

28:16.570 --> 28:18.970
that gets lost on his way home
from the dark wood,

28:18.980 --> 28:21.380
and he gets so scared,
so frightened,

28:21.380 --> 28:25.180
that he wants to just curl up
in a little ball and give up.

28:25.180 --> 28:27.920
But then he remembers what
his mother always tells him.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.520
No matter how dark things look,

28:31.520 --> 28:34.020
just keep hopping
and you'll find your way home.

28:36.530 --> 28:37.630
Just keep hopping.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.260
Just keep...

28:42.270 --> 28:43.370
...hopping.

28:49.070 --> 28:51.610
Just keep... hopping.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.350
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:56.350 --> 29:00.150
Just keep... hopping!

29:00.150 --> 29:01.780
Hopping!

29:04.290 --> 29:06.960
And hopping!

29:06.960 --> 29:09.120
Find your way home!

29:12.830 --> 29:13.730
We made it.

29:19.240 --> 29:22.570
That last chamber was
a test of perseverance.

29:22.570 --> 29:25.310
Thank you, Dennis.

29:25.310 --> 29:28.380
And thank you all
for bringing me this far.

29:29.980 --> 29:33.110
But here is where we must part.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.380
You mean, we can't go in?

29:35.390 --> 29:38.390
No. The Library must stay
a magical secret place.

29:38.390 --> 29:40.120
It cannot be shared
with the public,

29:40.120 --> 29:42.790
despite what your friend
Jeff thinks.

29:42.790 --> 29:44.790
Go to his house,

29:44.800 --> 29:46.530
and if all turns out well,

29:46.530 --> 29:48.700
you'll soon have your friend
back to normal.

29:56.270 --> 29:57.710
May I borrow your sword?

29:59.410 --> 30:02.210
Would you three
take a knee, please?

30:05.680 --> 30:08.420
In the name of the ancient gods,

30:08.420 --> 30:10.090
and to all the ancient kings,

30:10.090 --> 30:14.220
I dub thee three
honorary knights of Camelot.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.190
Rise, knights.

30:20.700 --> 30:25.030
I have fought beside
the greatest of warriors,

30:25.040 --> 30:26.870
but none braver than you.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.510
Now, go.

30:34.510 --> 30:37.410
I have an evil book I must find.

30:55.530 --> 30:59.000
Mr. Stone. Mr. Stone.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.670
Ezekiel. Cassan...

31:01.670 --> 31:04.010
Colonel?

31:04.010 --> 31:05.140
Colonel. Colonel.

31:16.220 --> 31:18.320
Show yourself!

31:21.630 --> 31:23.420
Oh, thank God.

31:23.430 --> 31:24.960
I thought that thing was back.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.100
You thief!

31:26.100 --> 31:27.230
Oh, crap.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:27.230 --> 31:28.630
You stole my body!

31:28.630 --> 31:30.570
Yes, yes, I did, but it was
just for a little while.

31:30.570 --> 31:31.900
I promise I was going
to give it back.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.370
- Liar!
- No, I'm telling the truth.

31:33.370 --> 31:34.570
I told the Librarians
about the book,

31:34.570 --> 31:36.510
and I was taking them to find it

31:36.510 --> 31:39.510
when this monster, it came out
and it attacked us, and I hid.

31:39.510 --> 31:41.580
You think that was bad?
Wait till I get hold of you!

31:41.580 --> 31:43.040
- Please, please, please.
- How dare you!

31:43.050 --> 31:44.910
Stop! Just stop.
Please, please stop.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.050
I screwed up.
I used the book,

31:47.050 --> 31:48.450
and I got in way over my head.

31:48.450 --> 31:49.990
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

31:49.990 --> 31:53.690
I'm so sorry.

31:58.260 --> 32:02.400
That thing.
What was that?

32:02.400 --> 32:06.540
That is Asmodeus, one of
the Seven Princes of Hell.

32:06.540 --> 32:10.670
Centuries ago,
Merlin entrapped him
in that spellbook.

32:10.670 --> 32:12.610
But by you using it,
you unknowingly

32:12.610 --> 32:15.680
released him back
into the world.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.880
- Your friends, are they...
- They're...

32:18.880 --> 32:20.220
They'll be fine.

32:20.220 --> 32:22.820
It's just a form of hibernation.

32:22.820 --> 32:27.220
Asmodeus' power
is limited for now,
but I must find him.

32:27.220 --> 32:29.360
I must entrap him again,
and to do that,

32:29.360 --> 32:31.360
I must be in my own body.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.560
- So give me that book back.
- You wanna switch back now?

32:34.570 --> 32:37.230
If I'm to fight
a Prince of Hell,

32:37.230 --> 32:40.170
I can't do it in this...

32:40.170 --> 32:43.040
short, slightly overweight body.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.970
I need to be in my own skin.

32:45.980 --> 32:48.510
But I like being you.

32:48.510 --> 32:51.580
- Jeff!
- You saw my life.
You saw how much it sucks.

32:51.580 --> 32:54.450
I mean, I live in my mother's
basement, for Christ's sake.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.720
My life is not yours to take.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.590
I know. I know.

33:00.590 --> 33:01.790
It... It...

33:01.790 --> 33:04.190
It's just...

33:04.200 --> 33:07.460
You had to be me
for a couple of days.

33:07.460 --> 33:08.900
I have to be me forever.

33:15.070 --> 33:18.410
Not long ago, I made a decision

33:18.410 --> 33:21.480
to become mortal.

33:21.480 --> 33:25.350
My choice. I...
I did it willingly,

33:25.350 --> 33:28.620
but I will confess
that I was not prepared

33:28.620 --> 33:31.890
for what it would be like
to actually be human.

33:31.890 --> 33:34.820
And I've been struggling,
truly struggling,

33:34.830 --> 33:37.430
with the idea
of growing older,
the limitations,

33:37.430 --> 33:39.560
and having to go into the world

33:39.560 --> 33:41.160
dealing with people?

33:41.160 --> 33:43.970
There are
a lot of awful people
in the world.

33:43.970 --> 33:46.240
Do you know that?
But I think
I'm coming to realize

33:46.240 --> 33:49.910
that I've been
concentrating on the negative
a little too much,

33:49.910 --> 33:54.380
because on the other side
there are wonderful,

33:54.380 --> 33:58.180
amazing things in this life,
in your life.

33:58.180 --> 34:01.050
You have phenomenally
faithful friends,

34:01.050 --> 34:04.520
you have a loving mother,
and you have food.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.920
Yeah, food is good.

34:06.920 --> 34:07.920
Food is delicious.

34:07.930 --> 34:09.389
Yeah.

34:09.389 --> 34:10.929
And so there are
beautiful things in life,

34:10.929 --> 34:13.929
in your life,
and we have to embrace it all.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.530
Because, really, what's
the point of having a life

34:16.530 --> 34:19.870
if one does not live it fully?

34:27.010 --> 34:30.350
If I have followed
this recipe precisely,

34:30.350 --> 34:34.150
this should do the trick.

34:34.150 --> 34:37.290
- Ugh, it smells rank.
- Eh? It... well,

34:37.290 --> 34:40.159
it can't be any worse
than your friend Schmidt's
homemade mead.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.389
Down the hatch.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.360
I could use a chaser.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.530
Ooh.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.699
Hey, what's going on?
Why do I still look like you?

34:54.909 --> 34:56.969
Perhaps the potion
has a delayed reaction.

34:56.969 --> 35:00.440
Oh, okay. So what?
Do we just sit here
and wait it out?

35:00.440 --> 35:01.780
No, no, no.
We have no time for that.

35:01.780 --> 35:04.110
For every minute Asmodeus
is out there,

35:04.120 --> 35:05.510
he gains in strength.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.650
Fortunately,
we have something he needs.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.720
When Merlin first
captured Asmodeus,

35:10.720 --> 35:13.860
he took some of his power
as a precaution

35:13.860 --> 35:16.460
and contained it
within a gem stone

35:16.460 --> 35:18.930
which Merlin then hid
inside the book.

35:18.930 --> 35:21.260
sort of a hide-in-plain
sight thing.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.800
So as long as I have
the gem stone,

35:23.800 --> 35:26.470
Asmodeus will not be
fully powerful

35:26.470 --> 35:27.900
and I can defeat him.

35:30.210 --> 35:31.410
There's no...
Where's the gem...

35:31.410 --> 35:33.140
there's no gemstone.

35:33.140 --> 35:36.210
This gemstone, um, was it...

35:36.210 --> 35:40.480
kinda small,
sort of a reddish color?

35:40.480 --> 35:42.750
- Oh, Jeff, no.
- Look, I didn't know.

35:42.750 --> 35:44.150
It was just sitting there
inside the book.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.290
What did you do with it?

35:45.290 --> 35:47.220
You know, I...

35:47.220 --> 35:50.290
- I s...
- Sorry, you did what?

35:50.290 --> 35:53.900
- I sort of gave it to my mom.
- You gave it to your mom.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.900
Look, it was her birthday,
and it sort of looked

35:55.900 --> 35:57.700
like a cubic zirconia,
so I figured, why not?

35:57.700 --> 35:59.170
So I just gave it to her
and then...

35:59.170 --> 36:00.840
I just don't
wanna piss her off.
I mean, you know my mom.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.840
She can be a bit
of a Ballbuster, so...

36:02.840 --> 36:06.240
Listen to me, Jeff.
Asmodeus will be looking
for that gemstone,

36:06.240 --> 36:07.510
so if it is with your mother...

36:07.510 --> 36:08.710
That's where Asmodeus
is heading.

36:08.710 --> 36:11.180
And she and your friends
are in grave danger.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.380
What do we do?

36:12.380 --> 36:14.520
We take the battle to him.

36:21.390 --> 36:23.660
Now, when we get inside,
stay close

36:23.660 --> 36:25.190
be prepared for anything.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.730
- I'm scared.
- You should be.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.410
Mom? Schmidt?

36:41.410 --> 36:44.610
- Asmodeus?
- What are you...

36:44.620 --> 36:47.220
- You don't call
for the Prince of Hell.
- Right.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.860
Back, foul beast!
Get the gemstone.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.000
She'll be safe
without the gemstone.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.930
Hurry! Hurry!

37:03.930 --> 37:06.070
- Mom, are you okay?
- What's going on?

37:06.070 --> 37:07.870
What's wrong
with that man's face?

37:07.870 --> 37:09.000
Mom, I need the gemstone.

37:09.010 --> 37:10.610
No, tell him to get his own.

37:10.610 --> 37:12.610
Mom, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

37:12.610 --> 37:14.740
Got it!

37:14.750 --> 37:16.210
Time to go!

37:16.210 --> 37:19.050
Bye, Mom!

37:23.220 --> 37:24.490
Come. Come. Come.

37:24.490 --> 37:26.290
We'll lure him back
to the Library,

37:26.290 --> 37:28.490
trap him there.

37:30.890 --> 37:31.830
Damn it.

37:31.830 --> 37:32.830
Oh! To the basement.

37:32.830 --> 37:34.400
Go. Go. Go!

37:36.370 --> 37:39.030
Oh, my God, my friends.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.440
Oh, my God,
this is all my fault.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.440
I did this.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.640
God, I'm such a schmuck.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.440
We don't have time for this.
He will find us.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.980
What if we just
give him back the gemstone,
apologize, be like,

37:48.980 --> 37:50.710
"Asmodeus, we're really sorry
that we took your gemstone"?

37:50.710 --> 37:53.720
You wanted to be
a Knight of Camelot.
Now is your chance.

37:53.720 --> 37:54.920
Fight.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.590
- I'm scared.
- Well...

37:58.860 --> 38:01.420
Oh, God!
No, no, no, no!

38:27.490 --> 38:29.590
Jeff!
Get out here and fight!

38:40.830 --> 38:41.900
Hey, zombie face!

38:42.970 --> 38:44.570
You want this?

38:45.770 --> 38:49.840
You shall not pass!

38:51.640 --> 38:53.510
Okay. No, I'm just kidding.
You can have it.

38:53.510 --> 38:54.580
You can have it.
I don't want it.

38:54.580 --> 38:55.980
Take it, please.
Just take it.

38:55.980 --> 38:57.580
Take it.
I don't want it.

39:16.130 --> 39:17.500
Well done.

39:19.870 --> 39:21.600
You fought well.

39:21.610 --> 39:26.210
Yeah. Well, it's easy
when you're Galahad
the brave knight.

39:26.210 --> 39:27.480
Take a look in the mirror.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.680
I did this?

39:32.680 --> 39:33.750
As myself?

39:33.750 --> 39:34.950
Like a true knight.

39:34.950 --> 39:38.550
We switched back when we came
through the magic door.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.160
Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.690
Oh.

39:46.230 --> 39:47.500
Jeff, is that really you?

39:47.500 --> 39:49.570
- Dude!
- Hey, what's up, guys?

39:49.570 --> 39:51.430
Dude!

39:54.300 --> 39:55.500
Oh, my God,
I have so many stories.

39:55.510 --> 39:57.310
It was amazing.
We got knighted.

39:58.780 --> 39:59.680
I wasn't even scared.

40:01.510 --> 40:02.780
I found Poseidon's Trident.

40:02.780 --> 40:04.580
Jeff was roasting
marshmallows with it.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.920
Still better
than what he was doing
with the Shroud Of Turin.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.250
Good Lord, how much damage
can one man cause?

40:09.250 --> 40:11.250
We're just happy
to have you back.

40:11.260 --> 40:14.590
What about you, mate?
You still haven't told us
what it was like.

40:14.590 --> 40:16.390
Yeah,
it must've been awful, huh,

40:16.390 --> 40:18.660
hanging out with
the common folk?

40:18.660 --> 40:23.000
Actually, you know,
people aren't bad
if you give 'em half a chance.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.940
They can be quite delightful.

40:26.940 --> 40:28.840
I have an appointment
I have to get to.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.870
I think I'll drive.

40:34.340 --> 40:37.810
Did he just say people
could be delightful?

40:37.820 --> 40:39.350
Wonders never cease.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.550
So that mind flayer?
He, like, melted his brain.

40:45.560 --> 40:46.690
- Yeah, my favorite.
- That was so good.

40:46.690 --> 40:47.690
I just replay that
over and over.

40:47.690 --> 40:50.560
- Hey, Jenkins!
- Jenkins!

40:50.560 --> 40:52.160
What's up, dude?
You're just in time.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.360
We're just about to fight
the acid-spewing black dragon.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.700
First of all,
black dragons breathe fire.
They do not spew acid.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.500
- He's so good.
- And I brought your mom

41:00.500 --> 41:01.840
a nice big bag of
Werther's Originals.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.240
- Aww, thanks.
- And you know what?

41:03.240 --> 41:05.170
If I'm gonna continue
playing with you guys,

41:05.180 --> 41:07.180
I need to be Dungeon Master.

41:07.180 --> 41:08.910
- Agreed.
- What? No.

41:08.910 --> 41:10.710
- Dude, come on.
- I'm moving. I'm moving.

41:10.710 --> 41:13.580
Dude, dude,
I can't have you
playing this game

41:13.580 --> 41:15.780
with all of these inaccuracies.

41:15.790 --> 41:18.590
Fine, but my character
gets to have the ring
of fire resistance.

41:18.590 --> 41:20.060
- Yes! Happening.
- Another ring?

41:20.060 --> 41:21.860
- Ring of fire... every time.
- No. It's not a real thing.

41:21.860 --> 41:25.330
Shh. Okay, danger.

41:25.330 --> 41:28.730
The moat? It is dark.

41:28.730 --> 41:31.570
But you must cross it.
What do you do?
