06:56.207 --> 06:57.916
In the year of our Lord...

06:58.126 --> 07:03.046
...Judea, for nearly a century,
had lain under the mastery of Rome.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.924
In the seventh year of the reign
of Augustus Caesar...

07:06.134 --> 07:08.593
...an imperial decree
ordered every Judean...

07:08.803 --> 07:11.263
...each to return
to his place of birth...

07:11.472 --> 07:13.807
...to be counted and taxed.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.687
The converging ways of many of them led
to their capital city, Jerusalem...

07:18.896 --> 07:21.940
...the troubled heart of their land.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.694
The old city was dominated
by the fortress of Antonia...

07:25.903 --> 07:27.279
...the seat of Roman power...

07:27.488 --> 07:29.614
...and by the great golden temple...

07:29.866 --> 07:34.077
...the outward sign of
an inward and imperishable faith.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.998
Even while they obeyed
the will of Caesar...

07:38.207 --> 07:41.376
...the people clung proudly
to their ancient heritage...

07:41.586 --> 07:44.588
...always remembering
the promise of their prophets...

07:44.839 --> 07:48.091
...that one day there would be
born among them a redeemer...

07:48.301 --> 07:52.637
...to bring them salvation
and perfect freedom.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.690
You'll be counted at Hebron.

08:03.858 --> 08:04.900
- Name?
- Samuel.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.193
- What city?
- Joppa.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.819
- What family?
- Michael.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.155
- Move on. Move on.
- Yes.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.781
- Name?
- Joseph.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.159
- What city?
- Nazareth.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.119
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.872
- And the woman?
- My wife.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.541
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.211
Come on, come on.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.843
What village is this?

14:47.094 --> 14:48.261
Nazareth.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.514
We should arrive in Jerusalem
tomorrow night.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.578
You're not watching
the soldiers, Joseph?

15:13.871 --> 15:15.997
We've seen Romans before.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.332
Yes...

15:18.042 --> 15:20.501
...and we will see them again.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.591
My table is not finished.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.343
Where is your son?

15:28.594 --> 15:32.847
He's walking in the hills.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.808
He neglects his work, Joseph.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.352
No.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.106
Once, I reproached him with
forgetting his work. He said to me:

15:42.316 --> 15:44.984
"I must be about my father's business."

15:45.235 --> 15:47.737
Then why isn't he here, working?

15:49.907 --> 15:51.407
He's working.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.623
Trumpeters of the legion!

17:01.729 --> 17:03.396
Welcome, Messala.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.272
The command is yours.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.898
Thank you.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.569
Thank you for relieving me.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.329
Drusus...

17:23.125 --> 17:27.670
...when I was a boy, I dreamed
of commanding this garrison.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.467
Now the wheel has turned.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.470
I am in command.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.980
Attention!

17:47.649 --> 17:50.735
Aisle one, face right!

17:52.112 --> 17:53.654
Forward!

18:01.080 --> 18:03.164
I'd forgotten the heat.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.500
If it were only the heat.

18:06.001 --> 18:09.253
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.964
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.

18:12.466 --> 18:16.219
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.514
If there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.769
If you want to rise, Sextus,
do the difficult.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.815
I asked to be sent here.

18:28.982 --> 18:32.193
I think you'll find the people changed
since you were a boy.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.028
In what way?

18:34.238 --> 18:38.449
Oh, won't pay their taxes,
an irrational resentment of Rome...

18:39.952 --> 18:42.036
There's nothing new in all that.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.165
And then there's religion. I tell
you, they're drunk with religion.

18:46.375 --> 18:50.253
They smash the statues of our gods,
even those of the emperor.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.713
Punish them.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.926
We do.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.762
When we can find them.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.223
Find the leaders.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.768
Oh, you don't know. There's nothing
you can put your finger on.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.396
I tell you, there are strange forces
at work here.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.064
For instance,
this "messiah" business...

19:10.274 --> 19:12.984
I know. There was one
predicted when I was a boy.

19:13.193 --> 19:17.738
A king of the Jews, who will lead them
into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.866
Makes your head spin.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.869
There's a wild man
in the desert named John...

19:23.078 --> 19:25.079
...who drowns people in water.

19:25.247 --> 19:29.375
And a carpenter's son who does magic
tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.919
There's always a rabble-rouser
stirring up trouble.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.297
No, no, no. This man is different.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.092
He teaches that God is near,
in every man.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.306
It's actually quite profound,
some of it.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.268
You've been too long away from Rome.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.936
Go back, Sextus.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.606
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...

19:51.773 --> 19:54.942
...and forget that
God is in every man.

19:55.277 --> 19:59.155
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.908
The emperor is displeased.

20:02.784 --> 20:06.120
He wishes Judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.540
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.

20:09.750 --> 20:14.295
But how? You can break a man's skull,
arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.673
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?

20:17.925 --> 20:19.759
Especially a new idea.

20:23.639 --> 20:27.433
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.810
I assume he has a name.

20:30.062 --> 20:34.482
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!

20:37.152 --> 20:39.153
Tell him I will join him.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.656
Yes, tribune.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.991
Centurion!

20:49.706 --> 20:52.833
This was his country
before it was ours.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.460
Don't forget that.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.797
Yes, tribune.

21:01.343 --> 21:06.681
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is
the richest man in Jerusalem.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.850
And the head of one
of the greatest families in Judea.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.019
We were friends as boys.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.730
We were like brothers.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.484
Sextus...

21:18.860 --> 21:22.196
...you ask how to fight an idea.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.198
Well, I'll tell you how.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.702
With another idea.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.367
I said I'd come back.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.746
I never thought you would.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.249
I'm so glad.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.301
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

22:26.678 --> 22:29.096
You've come back a tribune.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.974
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.020
We'll drink another now.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.773
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.901
They've talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.444
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.447
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.116
She's been in love with you
since she was 5.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.452
I can't wait to see them.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.205
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

22:54.414 --> 22:56.040
Or have you become too dignified?

23:14.226 --> 23:19.271
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!

23:27.656 --> 23:29.281
Where the beams cross?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.131
Good.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.025
After all these years!

24:06.403 --> 24:07.987
Still close.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.864
In every way.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.201
I hope so.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.538
I know.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.376
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...

24:23.795 --> 24:25.337
...whose life you once saved.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.091
The best thing I ever did.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.055
Judah...

24:37.225 --> 24:39.727
...it will be very difficult
to govern here.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.562
I'm going to need help.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.690
Your help. Your advice.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.198
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.826
Withdraw your legions.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.747
Give us our freedom.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.545
Unfortunately, the emperor
is devoted to his empire.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.048
He's particularly fond of Judea.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.092
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.554
Is there anything so sad
as unrequited love?

25:21.853 --> 25:23.103
My quarters.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.439
A bit grim.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.107
Not grim.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.902
Austere. Virtuous.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.612
Roman.

25:35.951 --> 25:40.454
I'm going to be second-in-command
to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.998
He's arriving in a few days
with two more legions.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.253
Then the rumors are true.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.467
The emperor does not approve
of your countrymen.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.638
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.187
But you and your family
need have no concern.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.190
I'm next in authority to the governor,
and you're my friend.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.443
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!

26:11.653 --> 26:13.946
What have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble?

26:14.114 --> 26:16.991
Rabble? They're my people.
I'm one of them.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.701
Be wise, Judah.

26:18.952 --> 26:22.997
It's a Roman world. If you want to
live in it, you must become part of it.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.040
You've changed.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.794
I've grown up. I've seen the world
since I left Jerusalem.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.715
I've seen Rome. It's no accident
that one small village on the Tiber...

26:32.966 --> 26:34.675
...was chosen to rule the world.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.552
Your legions.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.639
It wasn't just our legions.

26:41.516 --> 26:45.352
Other countries have armies,
fine armies. I know, I fought them.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.645
Oh, no.

26:47.439 --> 26:52.026
No, it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world. And we have.

26:52.193 --> 26:55.237
Our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth.

26:55.530 --> 26:58.949
Roman law, architecture, literature
are the glory of the human race.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.535
I believe in the future of my people.

27:02.245 --> 27:05.456
Of course you do.
And you can help them.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.375
How?

27:09.210 --> 27:10.502
You're an aristocrat.

27:10.712 --> 27:14.048
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.884
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.595
They'd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.182
Persuade your people that
their resistance to Rome is stupid.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.726
It is worse than stupid, futile!

27:25.977 --> 27:29.480
For it can end in only one way,
extinction for your people!

27:35.111 --> 27:37.988
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.783
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.409
Then we're agreed!

27:44.120 --> 27:46.580
Now, when can I come
to see your family?

27:48.416 --> 27:51.377
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.297
And now for our toast.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.427
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.555
It's especially fermented
for the Roman army.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.267
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.274
It's an insane world.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.278
But in it there is one sanity:

28:18.947 --> 28:21.407
The loyalty of old friends.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.078
Judah, we must believe in one another.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.539
Will you drink to that?

28:32.794 --> 28:34.461
With all my heart.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.984
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.987
The court where we played
at changing the guard.

29:00.155 --> 29:04.366
The roof where we'd throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide.

29:04.659 --> 29:07.995
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.

29:08.204 --> 29:10.289
I would have that time again.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.958
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.626
Except for the fountain.

29:14.836 --> 29:19.006
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.

29:19.799 --> 29:23.969
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.723
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?

29:28.016 --> 29:32.519
Of course he has. He was a boy
when he left us, now he's a man.

29:32.687 --> 29:35.022
With great responsibilities.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.399
Come.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.904
The emperor builds and builds,
turning brick to marble.

29:42.155 --> 29:45.115
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.248
I've never seen anything
like this before. It's beautiful!

29:53.500 --> 29:56.502
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan. I was there last year.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.212
A tremendous campaign.

29:58.421 --> 30:01.882
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.344
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.387
Or was, till we destroyed it.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.433
Now it's nothing but ashes.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.021
I'm boring you with soldier stories.

30:16.898 --> 30:20.150
Come with me, there's something
I want to show you.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.277
Thank you for this.

30:22.529 --> 30:26.448
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.715
What do you think of it?

30:45.260 --> 30:46.802
Magnificent.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.307
It's Arabic.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.936
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.

30:56.437 --> 30:57.813
Let me try him sometime.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.566
Whenever you like. He's yours.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.612
Do you mean you'll give me this?

31:06.281 --> 31:07.948
Oh, Judah.

31:09.826 --> 31:13.787
You are good. It's going
to be like old times, I know it.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.796
Judah, tell me, did you...

31:23.464 --> 31:24.965
...think about what I said?

31:25.133 --> 31:27.843
Yes. Talked to a number
of people already.

31:28.094 --> 31:30.804
Spoken against violence,
against incidents.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.848
Most of the men agree with me.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.100
Most? Not all?

31:35.810 --> 31:38.645
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?

31:39.939 --> 31:42.816
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.026
Who are they?

31:47.322 --> 31:50.282
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

31:57.332 --> 32:00.167
Would I retain your friendship
if I became an informer?

32:00.376 --> 32:02.544
Telling the names of criminals
is not informing.

32:02.795 --> 32:05.631
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.341
Patriots?!

32:13.056 --> 32:14.556
Judah.

32:15.016 --> 32:19.144
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.

32:20.063 --> 32:24.524
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.

32:24.859 --> 32:27.694
This is my great opportunity,
and yours too.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.364
If I bring order here,
I can have any post I want.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.867
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?

32:34.077 --> 32:37.079
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side
of Caesar himself.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.040
I mean it. It can happen
and this is the moment.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.000
I swear, this is the time.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.046
The emperor is watching us, judging
us. All I need do is serve him.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.716
And all you need do
is help me serve him.

32:51.719 --> 32:55.555
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God. The only God.

32:55.723 --> 32:59.810
He is power,
real power on earth, not...

33:01.396 --> 33:02.896
Not that.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.733
Help me, Judah.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.905
I would do anything
for you, Messala...

33:12.699 --> 33:15.409
...except betray my own people.

33:15.743 --> 33:20.247
In the name of all the gods, what do
the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

33:23.543 --> 33:27.921
If I cannot persuade them, that does
not mean I would help you murder them.

33:29.924 --> 33:33.635
Besides, you must
understand this, Messala.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.596
I believe in the past
and future of my people.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.433
Future? You are a conquered people.

33:41.477 --> 33:45.230
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.607
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.

33:47.984 --> 33:52.070
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.614
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?

33:54.907 --> 33:57.784
Joshua will not rise again
to save you nor David.

33:58.077 --> 34:01.955
There is only one reality in
the world today. Look to the West.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.582
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

34:03.791 --> 34:05.792
Better a fool
than a traitor or a killer.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.795
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.965
- I warn you...
- No! I warn you.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.967
Rome is an affront to God.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.512
Rome is strangling my people
and my country, the whole earth!

34:17.804 --> 34:19.181
But not forever.

34:19.431 --> 34:23.143
And I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom...

34:23.393 --> 34:26.146
...such as the world
has never heard before.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.945
Judah.

34:35.156 --> 34:39.117
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.454
You're either for me or against me.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.170
If that is the choice...

34:51.464 --> 34:53.507
...then I am against you.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.577
There they are.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.747
Where's Messala?

35:27.667 --> 35:29.376
- Where's?
- He's gone.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.378
Gone?

35:32.547 --> 35:34.381
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.

35:34.590 --> 35:38.051
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.054
Come. Let us have dinner.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.238
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
King of the world...

35:58.489 --> 36:00.907
...who bringeth to us
bread from the earth.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.916
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.631
He wanted to use me
to betray our people.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.761
Judah.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.601
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.312
Simonides.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.024
- Welcome.
- Judah.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.777
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.

37:18.986 --> 37:21.571
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.616
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.660
And for the master, lberian wine.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.829
Not to mention the best gift of all,
your presence.

37:29.997 --> 37:33.833
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.628
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.630
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.173
And what of Numidia?

37:40.383 --> 37:44.010
The trade route is ours,
guaranteed by treaty with the king.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.846
Once a year,
you bring your accounting.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.849
And once a year,
I find myself wealthier.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.978
Yeah, but my greatest treasure
is my steward.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.814
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

37:56.023 --> 37:59.359
Nothing else exists for me,
except my daughter.

37:59.694 --> 38:03.363
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.532
She was born
the daughter of your slave.

38:05.741 --> 38:09.369
When I inherited you,
I inherited a friend, not a slave.

38:09.537 --> 38:13.248
Still, Esther has come with me from
Antioch for your permission to marry.

38:13.541 --> 38:17.210
It's granted. I wish you
the joy of many grandchildren.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.839
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.

38:55.249 --> 38:58.376
With your permission,
Esther wishes to speak to her master.

39:16.312 --> 39:18.605
You're eager to marry, Esther?

39:20.941 --> 39:22.901
It is my father's wish.

39:25.946 --> 39:28.114
Your husband will be fortunate.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.284
What is his name?

39:32.119 --> 39:34.287
David, son of Mathias.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.122
Of what house?

39:36.832 --> 39:39.501
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.587
Tell me more about him.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.299
I have seen him only once.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.635
He is a merchant,
well-thought-of in Antioch.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.346
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.475
Her freedom will be
my wedding gift to Esther.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.606
You are generous, master.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.823
Do you love this man?

40:14.537 --> 40:16.496
I will learn to love him.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.724
You have my permission to marry.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.978
We'll drink to your happiness.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.440
And a safe return to Antioch.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.091
I disturbed you.

41:10.759 --> 41:11.885
No.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.137
What were you thinking?

41:15.222 --> 41:17.474
I was saying goodbye...

41:18.184 --> 41:19.767
...to this city...

41:20.644 --> 41:22.395
...and this house.

41:26.817 --> 41:30.695
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?

41:31.989 --> 41:34.532
My father sometimes brought me here...

41:34.909 --> 41:36.409
...when I was little.

41:38.245 --> 41:41.581
It was a house
where I was always happy.

41:44.418 --> 41:46.044
Except once.

41:47.463 --> 41:50.340
When you and your friend,
the Roman boy...

41:50.841 --> 41:52.634
- Messala.
- Yes.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.553
You had been out hunting...

41:56.847 --> 41:59.474
...and they brought you home injured.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.937
I touched your face
as you lay there...

42:08.484 --> 42:12.362
...and prayed to God,
"Don't let this boy die."

42:15.950 --> 42:20.495
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.

42:22.498 --> 42:23.581
Yes, master.

42:23.832 --> 42:27.252
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.

42:29.296 --> 42:33.258
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.098
And now...

42:41.684 --> 42:43.476
...I hardly feel free.

42:45.771 --> 42:49.566
You know, in the old, wise days
of Solomon...

42:49.817 --> 42:51.901
...if there was among his slaves...

42:52.111 --> 42:54.904
...some girl who filled his eyes...

42:55.573 --> 42:58.241
...he could choose her out
from the rest...

42:59.410 --> 43:00.994
...and take her to him.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.122
Wise days of Solomon.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.292
Different days.

43:10.337 --> 43:11.838
And long ago.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.391
If you were not a bride...

43:24.310 --> 43:26.686
...I should kiss you goodbye.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.524
If I were not a bride...

43:32.109 --> 43:34.652
...there would be no goodbyes
to be said.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.792
Your slave ring.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.048
Fair exchange.

43:56.717 --> 43:59.927
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.055
You will wear it?

44:09.647 --> 44:12.273
Until you meet the woman
you will marry?

44:19.698 --> 44:21.115
Until then.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.587
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

45:57.796 --> 46:01.048
If it is the governor's pleasure,
the wreath of office.

46:01.467 --> 46:02.967
Thank you, tribune.

46:05.512 --> 46:07.513
I see no delegation from the city.

46:07.723 --> 46:09.891
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?

46:10.184 --> 46:12.477
Jerusalem's welcome will not
be a warm one.

46:12.686 --> 46:15.480
But I pledge, my lord,
it will be a quiet one.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.690
Let us proceed.

47:20.629 --> 47:22.171
There's Messala.

47:33.517 --> 47:35.184
He saw you, Judah.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.299
The new governor.

48:22.316 --> 48:23.649
Stand back!

48:25.736 --> 48:28.154
- Stand back.
- Up there. You, come!

48:28.447 --> 48:30.323
Had to be the Jews!

48:36.663 --> 48:39.457
Open up in the name
of the divine emperor!

48:50.010 --> 48:53.721
Judah! Tirzah! What is it?
What's happened?

48:53.931 --> 48:55.848
Open up in the name of Rome!

48:56.016 --> 48:59.143
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.

48:59.353 --> 49:01.520
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.

49:01.730 --> 49:05.358
She won't have to say anything.
You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

49:05.859 --> 49:07.652
Open the gates!

49:13.909 --> 49:15.368
I'll speak to them.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.496
- Arrest him!
- Wait. Let me tell you what happened.

49:18.747 --> 49:20.998
Hold those women.
Not them!

49:21.208 --> 49:23.292
- Judah!
- It was an accident.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.965
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.

49:29.216 --> 49:32.718
- This is the man, sir. We saw him.
- It was an accident.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.304
- Accident?
- I swear it.

49:35.514 --> 49:38.808
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. It gave way.

49:39.017 --> 49:40.893
Take him. Take all of them.

49:41.061 --> 49:44.313
He's telling the truth!
- It was me! Let them go!

49:44.481 --> 49:45.523
Judah!

49:45.691 --> 49:47.692
Attention!

49:52.489 --> 49:53.823
Messala.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.001
In the name of God,
tell them it's a mistake.

50:05.210 --> 50:08.295
I leaned on the tile,
and it broke loose.

50:11.925 --> 50:14.176
It was an accident.

50:23.437 --> 50:26.689
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!

50:26.940 --> 50:29.233
Messala!
Messala.

50:32.362 --> 50:33.821
Let the servants go.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.699
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.666
- Come.
- Where?

52:09.543 --> 52:10.584
Tirus.

52:12.420 --> 52:13.879
Tirus?

52:15.882 --> 52:17.675
I've had no trial.

52:18.343 --> 52:21.220
I'm to die in the galleys
without even a trial?

52:21.429 --> 52:24.140
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!

52:24.391 --> 52:27.643
Wait. My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?

52:27.853 --> 52:29.353
Tie his hands.

52:31.898 --> 52:35.568
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

53:06.349 --> 53:07.892
Get along. Keep moving.

53:23.116 --> 53:24.366
Jailer!

53:25.827 --> 53:28.037
Guard, in there!

53:28.538 --> 53:30.414
Up the stairs!

53:30.790 --> 53:34.919
Jailer!

53:37.047 --> 53:38.380
To the right.

54:32.686 --> 54:34.937
Wait!
Send them out.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.524
Send them out.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.652
You can go.

54:44.447 --> 54:45.572
Go!

54:50.495 --> 54:51.578
The door.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.506
Where are my mother and sister?

55:14.352 --> 55:15.394
Where are they?

55:18.606 --> 55:20.816
Here, within these walls.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.570
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.866
Of course, they will be sentenced.

55:32.495 --> 55:36.123
Is it possible, Messala?

55:37.500 --> 55:40.461
Is it possible
you could do this to us?

55:40.670 --> 55:43.422
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?

55:44.549 --> 55:46.258
You'll let them go.

55:46.426 --> 55:48.927
You must.
You will gladly let them go!

55:49.095 --> 55:50.846
Messala!

55:53.558 --> 55:56.685
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad. I'm not a murderer!

55:56.895 --> 55:58.562
I know you're not.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.815
You know?

56:05.862 --> 56:07.071
You are evil.

56:07.530 --> 56:10.032
No, Judah, I am not evil.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.493
I wanted your help.

56:13.286 --> 56:15.162
Now you've given it to me.

56:15.997 --> 56:19.291
By making this example of you,
I discourage treason.

56:19.542 --> 56:23.504
By condemning without hesitation
an old friend, I shall be feared.

56:26.216 --> 56:28.300
But not my family.

56:29.719 --> 56:31.428
Let them go.

56:32.013 --> 56:33.055
Please.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.976
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?!

56:41.106 --> 56:43.232
Didn't I beg you?

56:48.571 --> 56:51.407
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.535
Kill me, and your mother
and sister will die today...

56:54.744 --> 56:57.079
...nailed to crosses in front of you!

56:59.082 --> 57:00.833
Go on, Judah.

57:01.918 --> 57:03.168
Kill me!

57:16.099 --> 57:18.392
May God grant me vengeance.

57:18.601 --> 57:22.438
I will pray that
you live till I return.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.481
Return?

57:30.029 --> 57:31.155
Take him.

58:07.942 --> 58:10.444
Sentries, salute.

58:11.321 --> 58:13.113
The tribune will see you now.

58:44.562 --> 58:48.190
Tribune, I'm steward
of the House of Hur.

58:49.567 --> 58:50.984
I remember you.

58:51.236 --> 58:55.072
We were on our way to Antioch
when we heard what had happened.

58:55.323 --> 58:59.076
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done
this thing. You knew him, tribune.

58:59.285 --> 59:00.869
Better than you.

59:01.120 --> 59:05.582
Then there must be no doubt in
your mind, the charge is groundless.

59:05.959 --> 59:08.043
The prisoners have been sentenced.

59:08.461 --> 59:10.504
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.

59:10.713 --> 59:14.216
There was never a threat against
the governor in Judah's mind.

59:14.467 --> 59:17.219
Surely you must know
he would never have done this.

59:17.470 --> 59:19.721
In your heart, you must know it.

59:25.061 --> 59:26.228
Drusus.

59:31.192 --> 59:34.528
This man had better be kept here
until we have time to question him.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:31.376
Hold!

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:29.226
Water for the soldiers.

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:31.353
Soldiers first!

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.858
Get away from that well!
No water for them!

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.945
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:43.031
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.913
Water. Water.
Soldiers first!

01:01:58.756 --> 01:01:59.881
Here.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:23.947
Wait.

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:26.658
No water for him.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.056
God...

01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:52.768
...help me.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.533
You! I said no water for him!

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:25.986
All right, on your feet, all of you!

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.612
Get them on their feet!

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:30.866
Back in line, you dog!

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:45.338
On your feet!

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.173
Get them going!

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:53.722
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!

01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:58.810
Forward, you dogs!

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.503
In a few minutes, the consul's barge
will be coming alongside.

01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:08.588
Be ready to raise oars.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.681
Raise oars!

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.310
Down oars!

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:42.497
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:05.770
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.815
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.895
This man is ill. Replace him.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.272
- Change him.
- Right, sir.

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:58.865
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:01.117
That will stop.

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.310
What service have you seen?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.688
Forty-one.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.901
A month's less a day in this ship.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:39.322
You keep an exact account.
And before?

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:43.033
Three years in other ships.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.412
Three years.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.145
You have the spirit to fight back...

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:13.064
...but the good sense to control it.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:20.321
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:24.908
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:27.078
It gives him strength.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.832
Now, listen to me, all of you.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:38.006
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.426
So row well...

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.929
...and live.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.191
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:10:00.069
Strike oars!

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:22.800
You know that a fleet
of Macedonian galleys...

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:25.803
...has been raiding Roman commerce.

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:29.307
The emperor has honored us
with the task...

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:32.185
...of seeking out and destroying them.

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:05.843
Battle speed, hortator.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.431
Battle speed!

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:42.213
Attack speed.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.507
Attack speed!

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.090
Ramming speed.

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:28.926
Ramming speed!

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.127
Rest.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.504
Halt!

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:48.923
Rest!

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:53.237
Why are you here?

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.949
I was ordered to report to you
during my relief.

01:14:59.077 --> 01:15:00.745
Oh, yes.

01:15:01.246 --> 01:15:02.914
I'd forgotten.

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:11.380
You could have killed me
as I lay there.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.758
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?

01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:16.385
I'm not ready to die.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.721
What do you think will save you?

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.557
The God of my fathers.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:25.102
Hmm. Your God has forsaken you.

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:28.523
He has no more power
than the images I pray to.

01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:32.568
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:34.237
I might.

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:37.615
Does that interest you, 41?

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.786
I can see that it does.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.249
I'm a fighting man by profession,
and in my leisure moments...

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:49.252
...it amuses me to train fighting men.

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:52.588
I own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in Rome.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:55.007
Would you like to become one of them?

01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:57.385
To die as your slave?

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.137
Better than to live in chains
below these decks.

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:02.807
I will not be here forever.

01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:05.226
No?

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.149
What would you do if you escaped?

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:17.446
Two people were condemned with me,
my mother and sister...

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.907
...though they were innocent.
I won't rest...

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:21.951
Do not say that you were innocent.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.454
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.

01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:30.793
Consider my offer carefully. You will
never escape while we are victorious.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:35.172
If we are not, you will sink
with this ship, chained to your oar.

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:38.342
I cannot believe that
God has let me live these three years...

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.344
...to die chained to an oar.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:44.181
It's a strange, stubborn faith
you keep...

01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:47.268
...to believe that
existence has a purpose.

01:16:47.477 --> 01:16:51.689
A sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.357
As you have.

01:16:54.192 --> 01:16:56.193
What drove it out of you?

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:00.364
Go back to your oar, 41.

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:18.966
Consul, enemy sighted.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:22.511
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:32.188
All the watch to battle posts.

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:39.278
Stand by to load.
Make ready to fire.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.905
Hurry, quick!

01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:46.202
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:53.918
Raise oars!

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:57.505
Down oars!

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.674
Chain rowers!

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.072
Guard.

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:27.243
Unlock 41.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.912
No! I don't want to die!

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:31.914
I don't want to die!

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:05.573
41, why did he do that?

01:19:06.324 --> 01:19:07.783
I don't know.

01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:13.497
Once before, a man helped me.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.500
I didn't know why then.

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:21.255
Normal speed!

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:59.627
Number 1, flame.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:02.838
- Fire.
Fire!

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:15.518
Fire!

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:17.228
Fire!

01:20:23.026 --> 01:20:24.902
Hold withdrawal on command.

01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:29.198
Lift oars! Raise!

01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:31.408
Withdraw!

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:35.079
Steersman, right.

01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:44.588
Extend oars!

01:20:46.299 --> 01:20:48.259
Fire!
Fire!

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:55.891
Fire!

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.573
Watch out!
Fire!

01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:12.241
Fire!

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:31.260
Steersman, ram course! Order below!
Ramming speed!

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:32.636
Ramming speed!

01:21:44.107 --> 01:21:46.650
Consul, barge on ramming course.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:57.870
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:54.374
Why did you save me?

01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:59.713
Why did you have me unchained?

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:22.945
What is your name, 41?

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:26.782
Judah Ben-Hur.

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:29.701
Judah Ben-Hur...

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:32.663
...let me die.

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:39.211
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:41.171
Row well and live.

01:27:57.146 --> 01:27:58.438
Is the sail square?

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.359
I can't tell.

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.363
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:08.865
My death.

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.159
Your freedom.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:17.958
It's a Roman sail.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.197
Face rear!

01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:53.410
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:57.998
Water.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.421
The fleet, all lost?

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:06.298
Five galleys.

01:29:06.924 --> 01:29:10.260
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.012
You have a victory.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.599
It was a victory?
Complete.

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:36.578
In his eagerness to save you...

01:29:36.829 --> 01:29:40.457
...your God has also saved
the Roman fleet.

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:17.577
Hail Arrius!

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:19.496
Hail Arrius!

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:22.249
Right oars!

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:20.176
You have cleared the seaways
of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:24.556
This baton of victory
has been nobly won.

01:33:32.356 --> 01:33:35.358
This man riding beside you, who is he?

01:33:35.818 --> 01:33:38.862
The man who saved me, divine emperor,
to return and serve you.

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:41.156
Is that all you know about him?

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:48.371
No. He was accused of an attack
on the governor of Judea.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:50.498
But he was innocent.

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:53.501
If not, there's a strange
inconsistency in this man...

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:58.131
...who tries to kill my governor,
yet saves the life of my consul.

01:33:59.091 --> 01:34:02.052
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

01:34:31.749 --> 01:34:34.668
We have all the information
on this man...

01:34:34.877 --> 01:34:37.337
...a man of some influence
in his own country.

01:34:37.713 --> 01:34:41.883
His attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of Rome.

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:44.928
I am convinced that
no such attack was intended.

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:48.765
Consul, allow us to continue.

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:52.394
Allow us to be generous.

01:34:53.604 --> 01:34:56.856
As a reward to you
for your great victory...

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:59.776
...we shall not send him
back to the galleys.

01:34:59.944 --> 01:35:04.280
We give him to you as your slave
to do with him as you like.

01:35:05.449 --> 01:35:07.742
Such is the will of the senate...

01:35:08.577 --> 01:35:10.537
...and the people of Rome.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:33.453
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...

01:36:33.704 --> 01:36:36.456
...with a young man
who had saved my life.

01:36:36.707 --> 01:36:39.876
You all know him as
the finest charioteer in Rome.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:43.046
Five times, he's driven
my horses to victory.

01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:54.599
I know him as one who stands
in the place of the son I lost.

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:58.353
I have the love and pride
in a son's achievements...

01:36:58.771 --> 01:37:00.939
...which I thought
I should never have again.

01:37:06.403 --> 01:37:08.571
Nothing could make stronger
the bond between us...

01:37:08.739 --> 01:37:11.282
...but tonight I wish
to share it with you all.

01:37:12.451 --> 01:37:16.412
The formalities of adoption
have been completed.

01:37:16.622 --> 01:37:19.791
Young Arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name...

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.252
...and the heir to my property.

01:37:26.882 --> 01:37:29.259
This ring of my ancestors...

01:37:29.885 --> 01:37:31.928
...would have gone to my son.

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:35.932
So now it is yours.

01:37:56.954 --> 01:38:01.708
It's a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life...

01:38:02.501 --> 01:38:04.127
...a new home...

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:06.546
...a new father.

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:10.174
It brought me here.

01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:12.844
It may take me away.

01:38:13.637 --> 01:38:15.471
But wherever I may be...

01:38:15.681 --> 01:38:19.851
...I shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of Arrius should.

01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:23.521
With gratitude and affection...

01:38:24.815 --> 01:38:26.149
...and with honor.

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:44.792
I present my son to you.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.254
My old friend Pontius Pilate,
young Arrius.

01:38:48.505 --> 01:38:51.674
Before you came to this city,
my horses always won.

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:53.885
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:56.387
Yes, but not swift enough
to defeat you.

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:59.057
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:02.060
I hear that the climate
is difficult to live in.

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:04.187
Not for Judeans.

01:39:07.858 --> 01:39:11.194
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.

01:39:11.403 --> 01:39:13.196
- Of Judea?
- Yes.

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:14.864
I asked for Alexandria.

01:39:15.032 --> 01:39:17.909
But it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents.

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:21.204
The scorpions and holy prophets
can't get on without me.

01:39:21.413 --> 01:39:24.874
Lay the dust of Judea,
at least for this evening.

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:26.793
Goats and Jehovah.

01:39:46.063 --> 01:39:47.438
You're leaving.

01:39:50.609 --> 01:39:52.110
I must.

01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:55.947
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

01:39:57.533 --> 01:40:01.953
Your eyes have never left it all
these months. I can recognize pain.

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:05.915
But still, my counsel is to wait.

01:40:06.125 --> 01:40:08.584
Gratus is to be replaced.

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:12.046
The governorship goes
to Pontius Pilate.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:16.968
When?

01:40:17.469 --> 01:40:18.928
Very soon.

01:40:19.555 --> 01:40:21.806
It's very much to our purpose.

01:40:22.975 --> 01:40:27.603
Nothing is to the purpose if, when
I come back to Judea, I come too late.

01:40:30.774 --> 01:40:34.986
That is the thought which has punished
me every moment I've spent here.

01:40:41.952 --> 01:40:44.287
Will Rome see you again?

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:54.964
Here is a part of my life
which you have made for me.

01:40:56.508 --> 01:40:58.342
I shall remember it.

01:41:01.597 --> 01:41:05.975
Whoever the gods are, they take
small interest in an old man's hopes.

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:08.311
They have their way.

01:42:49.163 --> 01:42:50.663
Forgive me.

01:42:51.039 --> 01:42:53.249
You're a stranger here.

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:56.919
Would you be from Nazareth?

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:00.590
Why do you ask?

01:43:01.049 --> 01:43:02.091
I thought...

01:43:03.719 --> 01:43:06.012
...you might be the one...

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:11.601
The one that I have come back
from my country to find.

01:43:15.564 --> 01:43:18.024
He would be about your age.

01:43:19.193 --> 01:43:21.110
Who?

01:43:23.739 --> 01:43:25.573
When I find him...

01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:28.492
...I shall know him.

01:43:33.832 --> 01:43:37.210
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:39.295
I am the guest of Sheik llderim.

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:42.590
Hyah! Hyah! Sack of flesh without brains!

01:43:42.799 --> 01:43:45.551
No! No! Not the whip!

01:43:47.137 --> 01:43:48.221
That is my host.

01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:49.597
Gently! Gently!

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:53.726
Fool! Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!

01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:57.313
Whip my children once and
I'll drain every drop of your blood!

01:43:57.522 --> 01:44:01.651
Now, gently around the first turn,
and let them run! Go on!

01:44:06.865 --> 01:44:10.368
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!

01:44:11.203 --> 01:44:12.453
Beautiful horses.

01:44:24.132 --> 01:44:26.592
Now! Now! They are ready!
Let them go!

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.810
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:40.564
No! No!

01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:44.568
Abadon, stop him!

01:44:46.571 --> 01:44:47.947
Stop that whip!

01:44:48.156 --> 01:44:50.157
I'll kill him! I'll kill!

01:44:55.664 --> 01:44:58.833
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:04.672
You think you can treat
my horses like animals?

01:45:06.174 --> 01:45:09.010
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:10.845
Get off, idiot!

01:45:16.184 --> 01:45:17.768
Drive goats, not horses!

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:20.146
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?

01:45:20.355 --> 01:45:23.607
This traveler told what would happen
before it happened.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.318
Hmm?

01:45:25.527 --> 01:45:28.487
Your horses are very fine,
but they're not a team.

01:45:28.697 --> 01:45:30.114
Not a team?

01:45:30.324 --> 01:45:33.159
But one of them held steady,
the one on the outside.

01:45:33.368 --> 01:45:35.661
- Antares.
- The slow one?

01:45:35.912 --> 01:45:37.121
Uh-huh.

01:45:37.289 --> 01:45:40.958
I think he should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns.

01:45:45.964 --> 01:45:49.383
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?

01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:51.469
In the circus in Rome.

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:56.098
You have driven in the great circus?

01:45:57.809 --> 01:46:02.146
Tell me, my friend, could you
make my four run as one?

01:46:02.397 --> 01:46:03.939
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:06.233
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

01:46:06.485 --> 01:46:08.569
We have time enough
to eat, drink and talk.

01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:10.946
Come into my tent
and refresh yourself.

01:46:11.156 --> 01:46:14.533
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

01:46:16.411 --> 01:46:20.373
If I had a voice to sing,
I would sing you the psalm of horses.

01:46:20.582 --> 01:46:23.250
No other animal has
descended so in scale...

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:26.045
...from the first innocent falling
of the world.

01:46:27.422 --> 01:46:30.841
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares
on the inside.

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:34.512
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.

01:46:35.013 --> 01:46:37.014
Judah Ben-Hur.

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:40.059
You're a Jew,
yet you drove in the great circus.

01:46:40.268 --> 01:46:41.435
Yes.

01:46:43.021 --> 01:46:47.024
By a strange choice
and a stranger fortune.

01:46:47.859 --> 01:46:50.486
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

01:46:50.695 --> 01:46:53.280
We might have achieved wonders.

01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:55.324
You have to go.

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:01.789
I make a journey which will not wait.

01:47:01.998 --> 01:47:04.333
Well, then perhaps you will come back.

01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:06.961
And when you do,
bring your friends, your wives.

01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:08.879
I have no wives.

01:47:09.131 --> 01:47:11.048
No wives at all?

01:47:11.383 --> 01:47:13.676
I have six, no, seven.

01:47:13.885 --> 01:47:15.553
Ha, ha. I've counted eight.

01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:19.056
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:22.643
Believe me, it is a great advantage
to have many wives.

01:47:22.853 --> 01:47:25.271
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:30.151
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.

01:47:30.485 --> 01:47:31.861
It is not generous.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:41.454
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.

01:47:53.425 --> 01:47:55.342
Thank you. Thank you.

01:47:55.552 --> 01:48:00.222
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.

01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:05.019
And now I must say good night
to my beauties.

01:48:05.687 --> 01:48:08.481
When they're ready for sleep,
they get impatient and jealous.

01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:11.525
They wait to see which one
I will embrace first.

01:48:12.068 --> 01:48:14.403
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.

01:48:14.613 --> 01:48:16.572
Stay and see them.

01:48:30.462 --> 01:48:33.380
Come, my children. Come.

01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:41.138
Strangers make them shy.

01:48:42.307 --> 01:48:43.390
Come.

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:46.685
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

01:48:52.484 --> 01:48:54.527
There, my children.

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:57.696
They are descended from
the Arabians of the first Pharaohs...

01:48:57.906 --> 01:49:00.241
...and I have named them
for the stars.

01:49:01.952 --> 01:49:03.536
Come, Antares.

01:49:03.787 --> 01:49:06.413
You are the slowest, and you can
run all day without tiring.

01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:10.084
What? Yes, yes.

01:49:10.293 --> 01:49:14.088
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.

01:49:14.339 --> 01:49:15.548
Come, Rigel.

01:49:15.757 --> 01:49:18.634
We've both supped well,
and the world is good.

01:49:20.011 --> 01:49:21.053
There's my good Rigel.

01:49:23.306 --> 01:49:25.641
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

01:49:26.935 --> 01:49:29.270
The day's work done for you, eh?

01:49:29.437 --> 01:49:33.107
Ah. Yes, well, you can go
to sleep in a minute.

01:49:33.358 --> 01:49:35.776
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:41.115
Ah! Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.

01:49:41.366 --> 01:49:45.035
No. You are the swiftest,
but you must be steady.

01:49:47.581 --> 01:49:49.957
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:52.167
You should see their mother, Mira.

01:49:52.377 --> 01:49:55.421
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.

01:49:55.630 --> 01:49:57.590
All right, all right.

01:50:02.012 --> 01:50:05.764
You are their friend, and they do
not give their affections readily.

01:50:06.516 --> 01:50:10.102
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

01:50:10.895 --> 01:50:15.149
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:18.402
You must be strong and swift.

01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:21.071
Go, my children. Go.

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:28.537
When they reach Jerusalem,
they'll race the world's finest teams...

01:50:28.747 --> 01:50:32.541
...not to mention the champion of the East,
Messala, with his black devils.

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:34.376
He stops at nothing to win.

01:50:34.628 --> 01:50:37.463
- Messala? In the circus?
- Yes.

01:50:37.672 --> 01:50:39.340
You knew him?

01:50:40.425 --> 01:50:41.634
I know him.

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:44.219
Perhaps without much liking.

01:50:47.766 --> 01:50:50.267
Judah Ben-Hur,
my people are praying for a man...

01:50:50.435 --> 01:50:52.311
...to drive their team
to victory over Messala.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.647
You could be that man, the one...

01:50:54.856 --> 01:50:56.982
...to stamp his arrogance
into the sand.

01:50:57.192 --> 01:51:00.319
My horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them...

01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:04.198
...one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.

01:51:04.407 --> 01:51:06.158
It's not possible.

01:51:07.452 --> 01:51:09.078
That is a pity.

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.122
Think of it. To break his pride...

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:15.834
...to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded.

01:51:16.044 --> 01:51:20.589
Just think, his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a Jew!

01:51:21.216 --> 01:51:23.384
I know it is not possible.

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.512
Does it not delight your imagination?

01:51:27.972 --> 01:51:30.307
Does it not answer your purpose?

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.560
I must deal with Messala
in my own way.

01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:36.397
And your way is to kill him.

01:51:40.193 --> 01:51:43.070
I see this terrible thing
in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.

01:51:43.446 --> 01:51:47.658
But no matter what this man has done,
you have no right to take his life.

01:51:48.076 --> 01:51:50.452
He will be punished inevitably.

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:53.163
I don't believe in miracles.

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:56.125
But all life is a miracle.

01:51:56.334 --> 01:51:58.669
Why will you not
accept God's judgment?

01:52:01.548 --> 01:52:03.465
You do not believe in miracles.

01:52:04.342 --> 01:52:07.386
Yet God once spoke to me
out of the darkness...

01:52:07.595 --> 01:52:10.264
...and a star led me
to a village called Bethlehem...

01:52:10.473 --> 01:52:13.559
...where I found a newborn child
in a manger.

01:52:13.768 --> 01:52:15.644
And God lived in this child.

01:52:16.771 --> 01:52:20.649
By now, he is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work.

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.568
That is why I have returned here...

01:52:22.777 --> 01:52:25.571
...so that I may be at hand
when he comes among us.

01:52:27.782 --> 01:52:29.366
He is near.

01:52:30.368 --> 01:52:33.996
He saw the sun set this evening,
as we did.

01:52:34.539 --> 01:52:38.459
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop.

01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:41.295
Perhaps he is a shepherd...

01:52:41.504 --> 01:52:44.381
...a merchant, a fisherman.

01:52:44.883 --> 01:52:46.592
But he lives...

01:52:46.801 --> 01:52:51.138
...and all our lives from now on
will carry his mark.

01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:56.059
There are many paths to God, my son.

01:52:57.187 --> 01:52:59.438
I hope yours will not
be too difficult.

01:53:10.283 --> 01:53:12.117
I'm ready for sleep.

01:53:26.549 --> 01:53:28.967
Balthasar is a good man...

01:53:29.177 --> 01:53:33.430
...but until all men are like him,
we must keep our swords bright.

01:53:33.723 --> 01:53:35.808
And our intention true.

01:53:36.976 --> 01:53:38.727
So I must leave you.

01:53:40.939 --> 01:53:42.815
One last thought.

01:53:43.024 --> 01:53:45.734
There is no law in the arena.

01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:48.445
Many are killed.

01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:53.992
I hope to see you again.

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:10.884
Fine Damascus silk.

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:13.512
Fine Damascus silk.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.682
Esther?

01:56:33.569 --> 01:56:35.320
It's Judah.

01:56:39.784 --> 01:56:41.410
Judah.

01:56:43.579 --> 01:56:45.497
- You are alive.
- Esther.

01:56:46.541 --> 01:56:48.792
You are alive.

01:56:50.545 --> 01:56:53.880
What are you doing here?
What has happened?

01:57:00.471 --> 01:57:02.222
Shh.

01:57:03.933 --> 01:57:05.267
I'm here.

01:57:07.228 --> 01:57:08.395
I'm with you.

01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:11.231
Esther.

01:57:14.902 --> 01:57:16.570
Where's your father?

01:57:17.113 --> 01:57:18.530
Hmm?

01:57:21.576 --> 01:57:25.412
The day they took you away,
they imprisoned him.

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:27.664
They tortured him.

01:57:28.124 --> 01:57:32.669
When they were sure he was hiding
nothing, they let him go.

01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:38.884
Ever since then, we have been
living here, in hiding.

01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:41.720
You never went back to Antioch?

01:57:42.096 --> 01:57:43.263
No.

01:57:43.514 --> 01:57:47.934
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.

01:57:49.604 --> 01:57:54.274
Esther.

01:57:54.484 --> 01:57:56.443
Where are my mother and sister?

01:58:03.451 --> 01:58:04.493
Esther.

01:58:06.079 --> 01:58:08.121
Let me tell him first.

01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:27.849
Father.

01:58:29.102 --> 01:58:31.812
Father, something wonderful
has happened.

01:58:33.147 --> 01:58:35.232
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.

01:58:36.651 --> 01:58:39.986
He has come home. He is here.

01:58:57.672 --> 01:58:59.005
Judah.

01:59:00.842 --> 01:59:03.176
Judah Ben-Hur.

01:59:05.847 --> 01:59:08.014
My dear old friend.

01:59:10.017 --> 01:59:11.977
Let me look at you.

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:14.062
Let me see you.

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:18.441
Yes, yes. It is true.

01:59:19.193 --> 01:59:22.779
Praise God for his mercy.

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:45.719
Where are they?

01:59:46.929 --> 01:59:50.140
Since that terrible day...

01:59:51.058 --> 01:59:53.602
...there has been no word of them.

02:00:09.452 --> 02:00:11.453
You should have been less loyal.

02:00:11.662 --> 02:00:13.663
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:16.917
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.

02:00:18.461 --> 02:00:22.589
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

02:00:22.798 --> 02:00:24.883
We were released on the same day.

02:00:25.092 --> 02:00:29.930
Malluch without a tongue,
and I without life in my legs.

02:00:30.139 --> 02:00:32.557
Since then, I have been his tongue...

02:00:32.767 --> 02:00:34.434
...and he has been my legs.

02:00:34.644 --> 02:00:37.854
Together, we make a considerable man.

02:00:39.774 --> 02:00:41.399
Old friend.

02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:45.654
She always said you would return.

02:00:45.863 --> 02:00:48.198
She never gave up hope.

02:00:50.284 --> 02:00:52.869
Though I hoped it,
I didn't believe it.

02:00:54.163 --> 02:00:57.999
I see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister.

02:00:59.335 --> 02:01:01.628
But suppose that isn't possible.

02:01:01.837 --> 02:01:04.422
If one purpose fails,
it is good to have another.

02:01:05.341 --> 02:01:07.467
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

02:01:07.677 --> 02:01:10.595
They could not make me
tell them where it is.

02:01:10.805 --> 02:01:11.930
It is there still...

02:01:12.139 --> 02:01:15.558
...to put power into our hands
and buy death for the Romans.

02:01:18.854 --> 02:01:21.189
That's not why I came back.

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:24.359
Judah, they are dead.

02:01:24.777 --> 02:01:29.447
Four years. No one could live
so long in the dungeons.

02:01:34.203 --> 02:01:37.122
Who lives more than one year
in the galleys?

02:01:37.832 --> 02:01:40.041
Yes, it is true.

02:01:42.378 --> 02:01:45.213
Judah Ben-Hur.

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:51.636
You have come back to us
like a returning faith.

02:01:51.846 --> 02:01:54.973
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

02:01:55.182 --> 02:01:56.516
- Let us laugh.
- We will.

02:01:56.726 --> 02:01:58.601
There will be joy again in this house.

02:01:58.811 --> 02:02:01.062
We will celebrate among the dust.

02:02:14.744 --> 02:02:16.202
I will take him.

02:02:47.777 --> 02:02:49.736
We stood here before.

02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:55.033
A long while ago.

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:57.577
Four years.

02:03:01.457 --> 02:03:03.249
But now it seems as if...

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:05.794
...only yesterday...

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:09.214
I was saying:

02:03:11.467 --> 02:03:15.220
"If you were not a bride,
I should kiss you goodbye."

02:03:17.264 --> 02:03:19.391
"If I were not a bride...

02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:22.394
...there would be
no goodbyes to be said."

02:03:33.114 --> 02:03:34.948
I am not a bride.

02:04:06.897 --> 02:04:09.149
Why did you never marry?

02:04:11.318 --> 02:04:13.111
My father needed me.

02:04:17.867 --> 02:04:19.242
And also...

02:04:28.169 --> 02:04:30.170
It's still on my finger.

02:04:32.506 --> 02:04:37.260
I said I should wear it
till I met a woman I would marry.

02:04:44.185 --> 02:04:46.853
It's become a part of my hand.

02:04:55.654 --> 02:04:58.698
If Messala once knew you were here...

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:00.575
As he must.

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:03.119
He will know where they are.

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:12.921
And if you should find?

02:05:15.674 --> 02:05:19.385
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.

02:05:24.934 --> 02:05:28.186
I've seen too much
of what hate can do.

02:05:28.771 --> 02:05:30.980
My father is burned up with it.

02:05:33.067 --> 02:05:37.695
But I've heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater...

02:05:37.905 --> 02:05:40.740
...and love more powerful than hatred.

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:43.368
I believe it.

02:05:43.994 --> 02:05:45.912
- Esther.
- Judah.

02:05:46.455 --> 02:05:48.122
Stay alive.

02:05:48.707 --> 02:05:50.667
Keep away from Messala.

02:05:50.918 --> 02:05:53.753
Only if I can give up
thinking and feeling.

02:05:55.881 --> 02:05:57.882
That time isn't yet come.

02:05:58.092 --> 02:06:02.595
The stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling.

02:06:03.097 --> 02:06:05.807
Only this time you won't be sent
to the galleys.

02:06:06.016 --> 02:06:08.226
This time you will be destroyed.

02:06:08.435 --> 02:06:09.978
You'll die.

02:06:53.814 --> 02:06:57.358
Tribune, compliments of Quintus
Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

02:06:57.568 --> 02:07:00.236
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:02.530
Thank him. Bring him to me.

02:07:03.365 --> 02:07:08.661
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.

02:07:09.371 --> 02:07:11.414
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?

02:07:11.582 --> 02:07:14.959
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.

02:07:16.879 --> 02:07:18.588
It's magnificent.

02:07:18.797 --> 02:07:20.715
And from a man I've never met.

02:07:20.924 --> 02:07:22.967
You're wrong, Messala.

02:07:36.774 --> 02:07:38.024
Judah.

02:07:47.534 --> 02:07:50.536
By what magic do you bear
the name of a consul of Rome?

02:07:51.872 --> 02:07:54.165
You were the magician, Messala.

02:07:54.375 --> 02:07:56.668
You condemned me to the galleys.

02:07:57.419 --> 02:08:00.213
When my ship was sunk,
I saved the consul's life.

02:08:12.434 --> 02:08:14.060
You know his seal?

02:08:26.073 --> 02:08:27.990
Now I have come back...

02:08:28.283 --> 02:08:30.660
...as I swore I would.

02:08:36.166 --> 02:08:40.378
Your gift is exquisitely
appropriate, young Arrius.

02:08:41.422 --> 02:08:44.132
You suggest I use it on myself?

02:08:45.634 --> 02:08:49.512
What has become of
my mother and my sister?

02:08:53.267 --> 02:08:56.310
It is not my duty
to keep track of prisoners.

02:08:56.979 --> 02:08:58.312
Find them, Messala.

02:08:59.815 --> 02:09:02.358
Restore them to me,
and I'll forget what I vowed...

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:06.112
...with every stroke of that oar
you chained me to.

02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:12.785
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.

02:09:12.995 --> 02:09:14.162
Then get it.

02:09:18.959 --> 02:09:21.169
I will come back tomorrow.

02:09:22.087 --> 02:09:24.881
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

02:09:39.772 --> 02:09:41.439
What became of them?

02:09:41.732 --> 02:09:45.276
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?

02:09:45.486 --> 02:09:48.112
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

02:09:48.322 --> 02:09:50.531
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!

02:10:05.506 --> 02:10:08.591
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter."

02:10:08.801 --> 02:10:11.344
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?

02:10:11.804 --> 02:10:13.179
East section...

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:15.973
...lower level.

02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:20.353
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

02:10:38.038 --> 02:10:39.205
Water.

02:10:39.748 --> 02:10:40.873
Water.

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.792
Let me out!

02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:45.336
Hear us! Hear us!

02:11:18.412 --> 02:11:21.289
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:25.585
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.

02:11:28.839 --> 02:11:30.548
The food disappears.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.375
Lepers.

02:12:35.656 --> 02:12:38.532
They must be taken outside the city
and released at once.

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:40.409
Then we'll burn out the cell.

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:28.874
Is someone there?

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:36.632
There is someone there.

02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:51.272
Who are you?

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.152
Don't come any closer.

02:13:59.448 --> 02:14:00.489
Who are you?

02:14:03.827 --> 02:14:04.869
Esther.

02:14:06.872 --> 02:14:08.205
It's Miriam.

02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:09.874
Miriam.

02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:13.502
Miriam?

02:14:16.173 --> 02:14:18.340
Stay where you are.

02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:22.428
You have come home.

02:14:24.181 --> 02:14:26.307
Stand back, Esther.

02:14:34.941 --> 02:14:36.400
We are lepers.

02:14:49.998 --> 02:14:51.624
Oh, Esther.

02:14:53.543 --> 02:14:54.835
Tirzah.

02:15:03.595 --> 02:15:05.054
Esther...

02:15:06.848 --> 02:15:09.141
...is Judah living?

02:15:09.935 --> 02:15:12.770
Yes, he is alive.

02:15:13.563 --> 02:15:15.272
He is here.

02:15:18.318 --> 02:15:19.819
Where?

02:15:21.071 --> 02:15:24.490
He is searching for you now.

02:15:24.866 --> 02:15:27.743
I must find him and tell him.

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:29.161
No!
- Tell my father.

02:15:29.371 --> 02:15:30.538
No.

02:15:31.498 --> 02:15:33.207
Tell no one.

02:15:35.919 --> 02:15:39.380
We are going away
to the Valley of the Lepers.

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:41.382
We won't return.

02:15:42.968 --> 02:15:44.385
But...

02:15:44.553 --> 02:15:46.679
...Judah has to be told.

02:15:47.097 --> 02:15:48.139
No.

02:15:51.184 --> 02:15:52.309
Please.

02:16:11.621 --> 02:16:14.081
I couldn't see his face.

02:16:15.917 --> 02:16:17.501
Is it changed?

02:16:20.422 --> 02:16:23.507
No, he is not changed.

02:16:24.467 --> 02:16:25.509
He...

02:16:29.181 --> 02:16:30.973
He's not changed.

02:16:33.309 --> 02:16:35.436
You love him, Esther.

02:16:46.531 --> 02:16:48.240
Promise me...

02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:50.950
...on your love for him...

02:16:52.204 --> 02:16:54.871
...you will never tell him
you've seen us.

02:17:03.965 --> 02:17:05.966
Is he never to know?

02:17:09.971 --> 02:17:12.513
Let him remember us as we were.

02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:15.308
Promise me.

02:17:25.986 --> 02:17:29.281
There's nothing else I can hope for.

02:17:30.325 --> 02:17:31.992
Only this.

02:17:39.125 --> 02:17:40.834
I promise you.

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:46.674
I am content.

02:18:06.068 --> 02:18:07.278
Wait.

02:18:53.366 --> 02:18:55.492
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.

02:18:55.701 --> 02:18:59.788
I pray to God they're alive
and that Messala will free them.

02:18:59.998 --> 02:19:01.874
He'll free them.

02:19:02.083 --> 02:19:04.209
He wants to survive.

02:19:05.712 --> 02:19:07.504
He cannot free them, Judah.

02:19:11.343 --> 02:19:12.384
What do you mean?

02:19:21.519 --> 02:19:24.646
- I saw them.
- You saw them?

02:19:24.856 --> 02:19:26.022
Where?

02:19:26.232 --> 02:19:27.900
When did you see them?

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:39.244
They were dead.

02:19:41.331 --> 02:19:42.373
When?

02:19:44.041 --> 02:19:46.418
When? When?

02:19:48.755 --> 02:19:50.172
In the prison.

02:19:52.384 --> 02:19:55.260
When I was waiting
for news of my father.

02:19:59.891 --> 02:20:01.683
Why didn't you tell me?

02:20:07.399 --> 02:20:08.816
I couldn't tell you.

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:11.819
Nor even you, Father.

02:20:13.488 --> 02:20:15.906
I was afraid that
if you saw Messala...

02:20:16.699 --> 02:20:19.952
Judah, you have come
to the end of your search.

02:20:20.161 --> 02:20:21.537
It's over now.

02:20:22.038 --> 02:20:23.247
Over?

02:20:24.165 --> 02:20:25.749
- Judah.
- Over?

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.254
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.

02:26:11.137 --> 02:26:13.472
Gentlemen. Officers.

02:26:15.475 --> 02:26:18.226
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...

02:26:19.061 --> 02:26:20.729
...may I enter?

02:26:21.397 --> 02:26:22.898
Certainly, sheik.

02:26:23.316 --> 02:26:25.317
You do us an unexpected honor.

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:28.820
The noble tribune is most gracious.

02:26:38.331 --> 02:26:41.416
And now,
the question you're all asking yourselves:

02:26:41.667 --> 02:26:43.293
Why am I here?

02:26:43.753 --> 02:26:45.712
As you know, I am a gambling man.

02:26:45.922 --> 02:26:47.214
The games approach.

02:26:47.423 --> 02:26:51.801
I am racing my whites against the
noble tribune's undefeated blacks.

02:26:51.969 --> 02:26:54.888
But I will back my own poor horses.

02:26:55.097 --> 02:26:56.598
No limits?

02:27:13.699 --> 02:27:15.242
Mark me first!
- And me!

02:27:15.451 --> 02:27:17.035
What odds?
- A moment, please...

02:27:17.203 --> 02:27:20.205
...my lords, protectors
of the far flung marshes.

02:27:20.456 --> 02:27:21.873
May I first, uh, sit down?

02:27:22.083 --> 02:27:24.125
Sit down. Lie down.
How much will you wager?

02:27:24.293 --> 02:27:26.962
- Yes, let's call his game.
Give the Arab a seat.

02:27:27.213 --> 02:27:29.089
A bench, quickly.

02:27:30.132 --> 02:27:31.466
Thank you.

02:27:34.845 --> 02:27:36.972
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.

02:27:37.223 --> 02:27:39.724
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!

02:27:39.892 --> 02:27:41.977
Your spirit does you credit,
but do not be impatient.

02:27:42.144 --> 02:27:44.729
There is time and money enough for all.

02:27:45.106 --> 02:27:48.233
First, gentlemen, the odds.

02:27:48.734 --> 02:27:52.237
The tribune has won many times. The
odds should be in the same measure.

02:27:52.405 --> 02:27:55.490
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?

02:27:56.617 --> 02:27:57.909
Two to one.

02:27:59.787 --> 02:28:03.873
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber,
masters of the Earth...

02:28:04.083 --> 02:28:07.752
...where is the courage
that made Rome master of the world?

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:10.630
I can get better odds
on any street market.

02:28:11.465 --> 02:28:12.882
Three to one.

02:28:13.384 --> 02:28:15.635
Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.

02:28:15.886 --> 02:28:19.264
In four years, the tribune has won
four victories in the circus.

02:28:19.432 --> 02:28:21.683
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.

02:28:22.768 --> 02:28:25.895
We know you have good horses,
but who is your driver?

02:28:28.482 --> 02:28:31.985
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.

02:28:32.194 --> 02:28:34.195
The Prince of Hur.

02:28:35.906 --> 02:28:38.450
Judah Ben-Hur.

02:28:38.701 --> 02:28:39.951
Prince of Hur?

02:28:41.329 --> 02:28:44.289
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.

02:28:44.498 --> 02:28:46.708
Returned? Impossible.

02:28:46.917 --> 02:28:50.420
The divine Tiberius is merciful
as always.

02:28:53.132 --> 02:28:54.132
Well?

02:28:54.425 --> 02:28:58.720
Will no one back the noble tribune
against a Jew, a galley slave?

02:29:02.224 --> 02:29:04.559
Perhaps I made a mistake
in coming here.

02:29:08.481 --> 02:29:09.981
You, tribune...

02:29:10.316 --> 02:29:12.317
...will you give me four to one?

02:29:16.572 --> 02:29:17.906
Four to one.

02:29:18.157 --> 02:29:19.699
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.

02:29:19.867 --> 02:29:24.704
Four to one, sheik. The difference
between a Roman and a Jew.

02:29:24.914 --> 02:29:26.498
Or an Arab.

02:29:32.338 --> 02:29:34.005
Bravely spoken.

02:29:36.092 --> 02:29:40.470
Now we will settle the amount
of our wager. I will venture...

02:29:51.357 --> 02:29:53.274
A thousand talents?

02:29:54.902 --> 02:29:58.988
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.

02:30:04.787 --> 02:30:06.705
Of course, if it is too much...

02:30:08.207 --> 02:30:10.291
A thousand talents it will be.

02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:11.918
Agreed.

02:30:59.133 --> 02:31:01.718
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.

02:31:13.355 --> 02:31:14.939
You're good fellows.

02:31:15.274 --> 02:31:17.776
If only men were this good.
Hey!

02:31:19.653 --> 02:31:20.945
Remember, Altair...

02:31:21.113 --> 02:31:23.782
...nine times around the circus, huh?

02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:27.452
Aldebaran.

02:31:29.538 --> 02:31:30.955
Hey, ha, ha.

02:31:31.373 --> 02:31:33.500
Rigel, did you hear?

02:31:33.709 --> 02:31:35.627
Nine lives to live.

02:31:37.463 --> 02:31:39.464
My swift fellow.

02:31:40.216 --> 02:31:43.676
You must not win the race
the first time around.

02:31:44.345 --> 02:31:46.721
You win the last time around.

02:31:48.057 --> 02:31:52.227
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.

02:31:55.356 --> 02:31:57.690
Steady Antares.

02:31:57.983 --> 02:31:59.484
Like a rock.

02:32:00.986 --> 02:32:02.779
You will be our anchor.

02:32:10.329 --> 02:32:13.039
I thought they'd never love
another as they love me.

02:32:13.249 --> 02:32:15.625
They have taken me into their family.

02:32:16.627 --> 02:32:18.503
Rest well, my stars.

02:32:18.754 --> 02:32:20.797
Tomorrow we go up to the city.

02:32:21.674 --> 02:32:25.802
Then if you defeat Messala and
the new governor there to see it...

02:32:26.053 --> 02:32:28.930
...the news will scorch the streets
of the whole Roman world.

02:32:29.181 --> 02:32:30.223
Pontius Pilate here?

02:32:30.432 --> 02:32:32.433
Yes, and ready to grind
his heel into us.

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:36.020
You will make him see
what men are born in this land.

02:32:36.605 --> 02:32:40.024
I only know that
I race against Messala.

02:32:56.250 --> 02:32:57.709
Look for the yoke.

02:33:00.045 --> 02:33:01.546
Ease that strap.

02:33:42.588 --> 02:33:47.342
God forgive me for seeking
vengeance, but my path is set.

02:33:47.593 --> 02:33:52.013
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.

02:34:07.446 --> 02:34:09.238
The Star of David.

02:34:09.448 --> 02:34:12.617
To shine out for your people
and my people together...

02:34:12.785 --> 02:34:14.911
...and blind the eyes of Rome.

02:34:17.831 --> 02:34:19.707
They are ready.

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:44.691
Ready, off!

02:34:47.236 --> 02:34:49.237
Easy, girl, easy.

02:35:28.861 --> 02:35:30.570
Number five.

02:35:31.613 --> 02:35:33.781
Where is number five?

02:36:04.563 --> 02:36:08.483
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.

02:36:08.817 --> 02:36:12.153
Yes, this is the day.

02:36:12.905 --> 02:36:13.946
Judah!

02:36:15.365 --> 02:36:18.409
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.

02:36:34.843 --> 02:36:38.429
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:53.486
Hail, Jupiter. Give me victory.

02:40:33.749 --> 02:40:36.500
Watch your line! Keep your places!

02:41:00.734 --> 02:41:03.402
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.

02:41:24.966 --> 02:41:26.258
Citizens...

02:41:27.177 --> 02:41:31.889
...I welcome you to these games
in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.

02:41:32.557 --> 02:41:35.142
We dedicate them to his glory...

02:41:35.352 --> 02:41:37.895
...and to the glory of Rome...

02:41:38.105 --> 02:41:40.773
...of which you are all part.

02:41:44.069 --> 02:41:47.279
Let us honor those
who race for us today.

02:41:47.781 --> 02:41:50.324
They come here from Alexandria...

02:41:50.575 --> 02:41:51.742
...Messina...

02:41:51.993 --> 02:41:53.327
...Carthage...

02:41:53.578 --> 02:41:54.787
...Cyprus...

02:41:54.996 --> 02:41:56.163
...Rome...

02:41:56.498 --> 02:41:57.623
...Corinth...

02:41:57.916 --> 02:41:59.250
...Athens...

02:41:59.501 --> 02:42:00.709
...Phrygia...

02:42:00.919 --> 02:42:02.670
...and Judea.

02:42:10.846 --> 02:42:14.098
To the best of these,
a crown of victory.

02:42:14.850 --> 02:42:16.976
The race begins.

02:42:17.602 --> 02:42:19.854
Hail, Caesar!

02:42:20.105 --> 02:42:22.106
Hail, Caesar!

02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:32.384
Oh, you dog!

02:46:23.348 --> 02:46:25.432
Come, my children, come!

02:46:42.450 --> 02:46:44.034
The Roman pig!

02:47:21.781 --> 02:47:23.781
Hyah! Hyah!

02:49:11.266 --> 02:49:13.016
Steady! Now, now!

02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:17.803
Salute.

02:53:32.443 --> 02:53:34.194
A great victory.

02:53:34.403 --> 02:53:37.030
You are the people's one true god...

02:53:37.281 --> 02:53:38.865
...for the time being.

02:53:39.450 --> 02:53:41.201
Permit us to worship.

02:53:49.127 --> 02:53:51.628
I crown their god.

02:54:11.566 --> 02:54:15.360
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.

02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:20.323
A long life, young Arrius,
and the good sense to live it.

02:54:45.433 --> 02:54:47.684
We cannot wait, tribune.

02:54:47.935 --> 02:54:50.228
He will come. He will...

02:54:58.362 --> 02:55:00.447
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.

02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:02.407
He will come!

02:55:05.953 --> 02:55:07.412
He will come.

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:11.625
I've sent for him, and he will come.

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:16.213
If you wish us to keep you alive,
we have to go to work now, tribune.

02:55:16.964 --> 02:55:18.298
Do you understand?

02:55:18.507 --> 02:55:20.634
To hack the legs off me?

02:55:20.885 --> 02:55:24.596
Not yet. Not till I've seen him.

02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:27.641
I don't receive him with half a body.

02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:42.739
No. No!

02:55:50.414 --> 02:55:53.458
I told you, Drusus. I told you.

02:55:53.834 --> 02:55:55.460
Here he is.

02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:33.623
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.

02:56:34.375 --> 02:56:37.460
The race won. The enemy destroyed.

02:56:42.550 --> 02:56:44.634
I see no enemy.

02:56:46.262 --> 02:56:48.096
What do you think you see?

02:56:48.306 --> 02:56:51.224
The smashed body of a wretched animal?

02:56:53.894 --> 02:56:57.647
There's enough of a man
still left here for you to hate.

02:57:02.862 --> 02:57:04.404
Let me help you.

02:57:19.211 --> 02:57:22.505
You think they're dead,
your mother and sister.

02:57:23.382 --> 02:57:26.134
Dead. And the race over.

02:57:28.429 --> 02:57:30.764
It isn't over, Judah.

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:32.807
They're not dead.

02:57:38.522 --> 02:57:41.122
Where are they?

02:58:02.546 --> 02:58:04.255
Look for them...

02:58:04.548 --> 02:58:08.259
...in the Valley of the Lepers...

02:58:10.262 --> 02:58:12.389
...if you can recognize them.

02:58:28.155 --> 02:58:29.823
It goes on.

02:58:31.242 --> 02:58:33.368
It goes on, Judah.

02:58:35.579 --> 02:58:36.955
The race...

02:58:39.333 --> 02:58:43.753
The race is not over.

03:00:34.907 --> 03:00:36.783
Is there a way down here?

03:00:37.117 --> 03:00:40.245
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.

03:01:29.253 --> 03:01:30.420
Man.

03:01:35.384 --> 03:01:39.262
I'm searching for two women,
a mother and daughter.

03:01:41.807 --> 03:01:44.934
There... There are many women.

03:01:46.562 --> 03:01:48.938
Of the family of Hur.

03:01:50.858 --> 03:01:53.151
We have no names here.

03:02:52.586 --> 03:02:53.628
For them?

03:02:58.967 --> 03:03:01.886
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.

03:03:02.096 --> 03:03:06.224
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?

03:03:06.558 --> 03:03:08.267
Not to see them?

03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:09.686
They are coming.

03:03:09.895 --> 03:03:14.607
Love them in the way they must need
to be loved. Not to look at them.

03:03:14.858 --> 03:03:19.362
Let them be as if you had
never come here. Please! Judah!

03:04:31.935 --> 03:04:33.227
Is Judah well?

03:04:34.563 --> 03:04:36.606
Is he happy?

03:04:37.816 --> 03:04:40.818
Yes, he is well.

03:04:44.072 --> 03:04:46.741
Your mind can be at rest for him.

03:04:47.367 --> 03:04:49.035
He is well, Miriam.

03:04:59.004 --> 03:05:00.505
God be with you.

03:05:36.917 --> 03:05:38.334
They have gone.

03:05:45.259 --> 03:05:46.801
We can go back.

03:05:51.306 --> 03:05:54.016
Go back to what?

03:05:56.436 --> 03:05:58.938
Judah, they have one blessing left.

03:05:59.314 --> 03:06:02.567
To think you remember them
as they were...

03:06:03.902 --> 03:06:05.903
...and live your own life.

03:06:08.615 --> 03:06:10.366
Forget what is here.

03:06:10.576 --> 03:06:11.784
Forget?

03:06:14.746 --> 03:06:16.539
It's as though
they were alive in a grave.

03:06:16.707 --> 03:06:19.417
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.

03:06:19.626 --> 03:06:23.087
How could you have suffered them
to come here? I must see them.

03:06:23.297 --> 03:06:25.840
No, Judah, please! Judah!

03:06:30.178 --> 03:06:34.557
Think, Judah, think. It would
tear them apart if they see you.

03:07:38.705 --> 03:07:39.789
Judah!

03:07:40.958 --> 03:07:42.208
Judah.

03:07:43.043 --> 03:07:46.963
He is here. I have found him.
The child has become a man.

03:07:47.214 --> 03:07:51.467
And the man, I know it now,
is the son of God.

03:07:55.639 --> 03:07:57.431
The promise is true.

03:07:58.684 --> 03:08:02.478
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.

03:08:02.688 --> 03:08:04.772
Life has been answered.

03:08:05.023 --> 03:08:06.899
God has answered it.

03:08:21.957 --> 03:08:23.958
Come. Come with me.

03:08:27.295 --> 03:08:29.755
When the Romans were marching me
to the galleys...

03:08:29.965 --> 03:08:32.049
...thirst had nearly killed me.

03:08:32.259 --> 03:08:35.011
A man gave me water to drink.

03:08:35.262 --> 03:08:36.971
I went on living.

03:08:37.347 --> 03:08:40.725
I should have done better
if I had poured it into the sand.

03:08:41.018 --> 03:08:42.309
No.

03:08:42.769 --> 03:08:44.311
I am thirsty still.

03:08:45.063 --> 03:08:46.897
Come and listen.

03:08:48.900 --> 03:08:50.943
I have business with Rome.

03:08:52.779 --> 03:08:54.822
You insist on death.

03:09:00.037 --> 03:09:01.579
Goodbye, Judah.

03:10:54.818 --> 03:10:55.818
You sent for me?

03:10:56.027 --> 03:10:59.029
I hope I bring you
a good conclusion to your victory.

03:10:59.239 --> 03:11:02.408
I have a message for you
from the consul, your father.

03:11:04.494 --> 03:11:07.580
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.

03:11:07.831 --> 03:11:10.082
You have been made a citizen of Rome.

03:11:13.962 --> 03:11:16.088
Do you say nothing to this?

03:11:18.884 --> 03:11:22.219
I have just come
from the Valley of Stone...

03:11:22.429 --> 03:11:26.348
...where my mother and sister live
what's left of their lives.

03:11:26.516 --> 03:11:31.395
By Rome's will,
lepers, outcasts without hope.

03:11:31.646 --> 03:11:35.983
I have heard this. There was great
blame there, very deeply regretted.

03:11:36.234 --> 03:11:40.905
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.

03:11:41.114 --> 03:11:43.741
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.

03:11:43.950 --> 03:11:47.411
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.

03:11:47.621 --> 03:11:50.497
Before the cruelty of Rome
spread in his blood.

03:11:50.707 --> 03:11:55.127
Rome destroyed Messala as surely
as Rome has destroyed my family.

03:11:55.378 --> 03:11:59.590
Where there is greatness,
great government or power...

03:11:59.799 --> 03:12:02.092
...even great feeling or compassion...

03:12:02.385 --> 03:12:04.803
...error also is great.

03:12:05.013 --> 03:12:07.097
We progress and mature by fault.

03:12:07.307 --> 03:12:10.976
Rome has said she is ready to join
your life to hers in a great future.

03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:12.728
There are other voices.

03:12:12.938 --> 03:12:16.440
The voice, for instance, of Arrius
waiting for you in Rome.

03:12:16.650 --> 03:12:19.151
He would tell you,
if I may speak in his place...

03:12:19.653 --> 03:12:22.821
...not to crucify yourself
on a shadow such as old resentment...

03:12:23.031 --> 03:12:25.157
...or impossible loyalties.

03:12:25.408 --> 03:12:27.701
Perfect freedom has no existence.

03:12:27.911 --> 03:12:30.829
A grown man knows the world
he lives in.

03:12:31.039 --> 03:12:34.500
And for the present, the world is Rome.

03:12:35.543 --> 03:12:37.920
Young Arrius, I am sure,
will choose it.

03:12:40.006 --> 03:12:41.924
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

03:12:54.062 --> 03:12:56.647
I cross this floor
in spoken friendship...

03:12:56.856 --> 03:12:59.066
...as I would speak to Arrius.

03:12:59.526 --> 03:13:03.195
But when I go up those stairs,
I become the hand of Caesar...

03:13:03.446 --> 03:13:05.948
...ready to crush all those
who challenge his authority.

03:13:06.741 --> 03:13:08.951
There are too many small men
of envy and ambition...

03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:11.328
...who try to disrupt
the government of Rome.

03:13:11.538 --> 03:13:14.123
You have become the victor
and hero to those people.

03:13:14.708 --> 03:13:18.836
They look to you,
their one true god, as I called you.

03:13:19.296 --> 03:13:23.257
If you stay here, you will find
yourself part of this tragedy.

03:13:24.217 --> 03:13:27.261
I am already part of this tragedy.

03:13:33.685 --> 03:13:35.769
Return this to Arrius.

03:13:37.314 --> 03:13:39.857
I honor him too well
to wear it any longer.

03:13:49.576 --> 03:13:51.785
Even for Arrius' sake,
I cannot protect you...

03:13:51.995 --> 03:13:54.663
...from personal disaster
if you stay here.

03:13:55.498 --> 03:13:57.541
You are too great a danger.

03:14:13.350 --> 03:14:15.184
Leave Judea.

03:14:17.020 --> 03:14:18.896
You have my word.

03:14:39.959 --> 03:14:41.168
Judah!

03:14:50.637 --> 03:14:52.429
Oh, Judah!

03:14:53.139 --> 03:14:55.557
I was afraid
you would never come back...

03:14:55.767 --> 03:14:58.060
...afraid of what would happen to you.

03:14:59.854 --> 03:15:01.855
But I see you again.

03:15:04.317 --> 03:15:06.860
Your father's waiting for me.

03:15:11.199 --> 03:15:12.408
Where is he?

03:15:15.245 --> 03:15:16.578
What do you mean to do?

03:15:25.130 --> 03:15:26.380
Oh, Judah.

03:15:27.799 --> 03:15:30.008
Rest, sleep.

03:15:30.218 --> 03:15:33.512
For a few hours of the night
let your mind be at peace.

03:15:33.721 --> 03:15:35.097
Peace?

03:15:35.265 --> 03:15:37.224
Love and peace.

03:15:37.434 --> 03:15:40.436
Do you think I don't long for them
as much as you do?

03:15:40.770 --> 03:15:41.895
Where do you see them?

03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:45.482
If you had heard this man
from Nazareth.

03:15:45.692 --> 03:15:46.984
Balthasar's word.

03:15:48.862 --> 03:15:51.447
He is more than Balthasar's word.

03:15:51.990 --> 03:15:55.993
His voice traveled
with such a still purpose.

03:15:56.369 --> 03:15:58.454
It was more than a voice.

03:15:59.372 --> 03:16:01.623
A man more than a man.

03:16:05.295 --> 03:16:09.298
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...

03:16:09.507 --> 03:16:11.800
...for they shall obtain mercy.

03:16:12.677 --> 03:16:14.970
Blessed are the peacemakers...

03:16:15.180 --> 03:16:18.307
...for they shall be called
the children of God."

03:16:18.892 --> 03:16:20.142
Children of God?

03:16:21.186 --> 03:16:24.021
In that dead valley
where we left them?

03:16:24.230 --> 03:16:28.025
I tell you every man of Judea is
unclean and will stay unclean...

03:16:28.276 --> 03:16:31.445
...until we have scoured off
our bodies the crust and filth...

03:16:31.654 --> 03:16:33.864
...of being at the mercy of tyranny.

03:16:34.324 --> 03:16:37.910
No other life is possible
except to wash this land clean.

03:16:38.161 --> 03:16:39.870
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!

03:16:42.081 --> 03:16:43.916
I know there is a law in life.

03:16:44.167 --> 03:16:48.086
That blood begets more blood
as dog begets dog.

03:16:48.338 --> 03:16:50.422
Death generates death...

03:16:50.673 --> 03:16:53.258
...as the vulture breeds the vulture.

03:16:54.010 --> 03:16:56.595
But the voice I heard today
on the hill said:

03:16:56.804 --> 03:16:58.514
"Love your enemy.

03:16:58.848 --> 03:17:02.017
Do good to those who
despitefully use you."

03:17:02.727 --> 03:17:06.230
All who are born in this land
hereafter can suffer as we have done.

03:17:06.439 --> 03:17:08.732
As you make us do now.

03:17:12.403 --> 03:17:14.780
Are we to bear nothing together?

03:17:16.574 --> 03:17:17.908
Even love?

03:17:21.621 --> 03:17:24.206
I can hardly draw breath...

03:17:24.624 --> 03:17:26.875
...without feeling you in my heart.

03:17:28.211 --> 03:17:29.628
But I know...

03:17:31.339 --> 03:17:33.799
...that everything I do
from this moment...

03:17:34.008 --> 03:17:37.219
...will be as great a pain to you
as you have ever suffered.

03:17:38.555 --> 03:17:40.722
It is better not to love me.

03:17:42.308 --> 03:17:46.853
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?

03:17:47.313 --> 03:17:50.274
You seem to be now the very thing
you set out to destroy...

03:17:50.483 --> 03:17:54.945
...giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.

03:17:55.154 --> 03:17:57.072
It's as though you had become Messala.

03:18:05.790 --> 03:18:07.874
I've lost you, Judah.

03:19:10.480 --> 03:19:12.230
No further.

03:19:13.191 --> 03:19:14.524
What are you doing here?

03:19:15.318 --> 03:19:17.819
I was here last evening
waiting for you.

03:19:18.029 --> 03:19:20.489
I have waited all night.
What has happened?

03:19:21.407 --> 03:19:22.866
Where is Tirzah?

03:19:26.079 --> 03:19:27.871
Leave the food.

03:19:28.998 --> 03:19:31.750
I am coming closer. Don't be afraid.

03:19:31.959 --> 03:19:34.336
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.

03:19:34.754 --> 03:19:37.381
I've heard him again,
the man from Nazareth.

03:19:37.590 --> 03:19:41.968
If ever words were from God,
they are in everything he says.

03:19:42.220 --> 03:19:45.347
I cannot bear that
you should have never known...

03:19:45.515 --> 03:19:49.351
...this hand of quiet
reaching towards us.

03:19:49.769 --> 03:19:52.854
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.

03:19:53.022 --> 03:19:55.440
Bring Tirzah
and we can go together to find him.

03:19:58.361 --> 03:20:00.570
Tirzah is dying.

03:20:06.994 --> 03:20:09.538
Leave the food and go.

03:20:11.749 --> 03:20:13.417
It's Judah.

03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:19.756
Why did you tell him?

03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:22.467
Yes, Judah, yes.

03:20:23.094 --> 03:20:26.304
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.

03:20:26.514 --> 03:20:27.556
Mother.

03:20:30.476 --> 03:20:33.437
Wait, Mother, wait.

03:20:33.646 --> 03:20:34.771
Let me talk with you.

03:20:34.981 --> 03:20:36.398
Please.

03:20:36.607 --> 03:20:39.192
No, no further. Please.

03:20:39.402 --> 03:20:43.113
No, Judah. Son, no.

03:20:43.906 --> 03:20:46.908
Mother, let me see Tirzah.

03:20:47.076 --> 03:20:48.076
Tirzah is dying.

03:20:58.755 --> 03:21:01.965
Judah, if they would see Jesus
of Nazareth they will know...

03:21:02.175 --> 03:21:04.176
...that life is everlasting...

03:21:04.427 --> 03:21:08.054
...and death is nothing to fear
if you have faith.

03:21:10.683 --> 03:21:12.350
I will take them to him.

03:21:14.437 --> 03:21:15.520
No!

03:21:16.439 --> 03:21:17.647
God, no!

03:21:31.704 --> 03:21:34.623
No, no, dear son.

03:21:35.666 --> 03:21:36.875
Mother...

03:21:39.629 --> 03:21:41.171
...where is Tirzah?

03:21:44.383 --> 03:21:48.804
Judah, no.

03:21:57.563 --> 03:22:00.482
You must not go to her, dear son.

03:22:01.859 --> 03:22:03.193
Please.

03:22:03.820 --> 03:22:05.320
Dear son.

03:22:56.622 --> 03:22:58.248
I am afraid.

03:22:59.208 --> 03:23:00.876
No cause.

03:23:02.336 --> 03:23:04.713
The world is more than we know.

03:23:40.917 --> 03:23:44.169
Tirzah, it's Judah.

03:23:44.587 --> 03:23:45.670
No.

03:23:46.714 --> 03:23:48.548
No, Judah.

03:23:50.676 --> 03:23:52.552
No, Judah. No.

03:24:32.218 --> 03:24:34.803
Alms for the blind?

03:24:35.846 --> 03:24:38.515
Alms for the blind?

03:24:41.644 --> 03:24:45.939
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?

03:24:46.148 --> 03:24:49.985
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.

03:24:50.152 --> 03:24:53.113
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial? Whose trial?

03:24:53.322 --> 03:24:56.616
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.

03:24:56.826 --> 03:24:58.952
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?

03:25:00.371 --> 03:25:01.746
What has he done?

03:25:01.956 --> 03:25:05.667
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.

03:25:05.876 --> 03:25:07.836
Help for the blind.

03:25:08.004 --> 03:25:10.171
Look, lepers!
Lepers!

03:25:10.798 --> 03:25:14.259
Go away!
Get away! Stay away!

03:25:15.553 --> 03:25:16.845
Go away!

03:27:36.318 --> 03:27:38.444
Lepers! Lepers!

03:28:00.009 --> 03:28:02.177
How can this be?

03:28:11.312 --> 03:28:13.646
I know this man.

03:28:27.745 --> 03:28:29.662
Will someone help him?

03:28:37.171 --> 03:28:38.463
Take pity on him.

03:28:44.720 --> 03:28:47.722
Have mercy. Have mercy.

03:29:09.870 --> 03:29:11.746
In his pain...

03:29:12.414 --> 03:29:14.791
...this look of peace.

03:29:16.919 --> 03:29:18.753
Watch over them, Esther.

03:29:56.792 --> 03:29:58.126
We must go back.

03:29:58.294 --> 03:30:00.670
I brought you here to this...

03:30:01.422 --> 03:30:03.131
...when I hoped...

03:30:06.051 --> 03:30:08.428
You haven't failed, Esther.

03:30:26.989 --> 03:30:29.574
Hail King of the Jews!

03:33:07.608 --> 03:33:11.152
This is where your search
has brought you, Balthasar.

03:33:17.951 --> 03:33:19.744
He gave me water...

03:33:20.496 --> 03:33:22.497
...and a heart to live.

03:33:25.501 --> 03:33:27.335
What has he done to merit this?

03:33:29.546 --> 03:33:33.341
He has taken the world
of our sins onto himself.

03:33:34.551 --> 03:33:37.470
To this end he said he was born...

03:33:38.680 --> 03:33:40.640
...in that stable...

03:33:41.350 --> 03:33:43.476
...where I first saw him.

03:33:47.064 --> 03:33:50.399
For this cause,
he came into the world.

03:33:57.199 --> 03:33:58.908
For this death?

03:34:01.703 --> 03:34:03.204
This beginning.

03:34:35.737 --> 03:34:37.863
I have lived too long.

03:35:08.937 --> 03:35:12.064
As though he were carrying
in that cross...

03:35:12.274 --> 03:35:14.442
...the pain of the world.

03:35:15.944 --> 03:35:20.448
So fearful, and yet why is it...

03:35:20.657 --> 03:35:22.950
...I'm not afraid anymore?

03:35:32.252 --> 03:35:34.587
The shadow of a storm.

03:36:00.155 --> 03:36:02.448
A strange darkness...

03:36:02.658 --> 03:36:04.617
...but still day.

03:36:13.543 --> 03:36:15.795
His life is over.

03:36:37.025 --> 03:36:38.359
What is it?

03:36:47.452 --> 03:36:49.036
This tearing.

03:36:49.996 --> 03:36:51.872
I am in pain.

03:36:52.833 --> 03:36:54.875
I feel it too.

03:37:25.282 --> 03:37:26.365
Miriam.

03:37:31.413 --> 03:37:33.164
I thought I...

03:37:34.583 --> 03:37:35.583
Miriam.

03:37:39.755 --> 03:37:41.547
Do you see your hand?

03:37:44.926 --> 03:37:46.010
Tirzah.

03:37:49.639 --> 03:37:50.723
Miriam.

03:38:02.819 --> 03:38:03.903
Tirzah.

03:40:19.956 --> 03:40:22.416
Almost at the moment he died...

03:40:23.919 --> 03:40:27.421
...I heard him say,
"Father, forgive them...

03:40:27.672 --> 03:40:29.965
...for they know not what they do."

03:40:32.218 --> 03:40:35.429
- Even then.
- Even then.

03:40:41.102 --> 03:40:45.606
And I felt his voice take
the sword out of my hand.

03:40:46.305 --> 03:40:52.290
