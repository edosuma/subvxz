00:41.451 --> 00:44.451
- Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

00:48.894 --> 00:50.094
How are you feeling?

00:50.453 --> 00:52.432
Oh, don't touch me!

00:53.018 --> 00:54.667
Nice to meet you, too.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.110
Hello!

00:57.476 --> 00:59.135
- You're in a hospital.

00:59.449 --> 01:01.127
Yes, I can hear you.

01:02.043 --> 01:04.203
My head hurts.
- I'm not surprised,

01:04.379 --> 01:06.227
you were hit by a cricket ball.

01:10.225 --> 01:11.692
Now, I am a doctor.

01:12.181 --> 01:13.381
I guessed that.

01:13.546 --> 01:16.067
I qualified as a doctor
just three weeks ago.

01:16.068 --> 01:17.448
We're all going to die.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.645
Thank you, porter.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.213
- So, I have a questionnaire.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.718
Name?

01:25.743 --> 01:26.943
- Um...

01:27.208 --> 01:28.408
well...

01:29.627 --> 01:31.075
Tom.
- Tom,

01:31.571 --> 01:32.771
super.

01:32.846 --> 01:34.886
Right, who brought you here today?

01:35.775 --> 01:36.975
Um...

01:37.034 --> 01:38.364
- Parents?
- No.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.098
They live abroad.
- Friend?

01:41.834 --> 01:43.274
I don't really have any.

01:44.428 --> 01:46.168
Right, I'll just put "other".

01:46.264 --> 01:48.958
- Let me past.
Get up, boy!

01:49.350 --> 01:51.690
It was only a ding, you can run it off.

01:51.781 --> 01:52.981
Sorry, headmaster.

01:58.316 --> 02:01.161
Right, that ball must
have been going extremely fast.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.661
It was actually one of my slower ones.

02:05.180 --> 02:08.239
- Conk. - Right, would you mind
awfully just waiting in reception?

02:08.240 --> 02:09.799
- Yes, I would mind awfully.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.626
- You might want to peruse one
of our posters on fungoids.

02:11.627 --> 02:13.547
Do you want a detention as well?

02:16.916 --> 02:18.645
Oh, no, more emergencies.

02:19.452 --> 02:22.645
"Newsagent has stapled
his fingers to a Mint Aero."

02:23.277 --> 02:25.197
We'll have to finish this later.

02:26.255 --> 02:27.455
Porter!

02:29.394 --> 02:30.594
Um...

02:31.851 --> 02:33.111
Have you got a dream?

02:34.130 --> 02:37.010
Something you wish you could do
before you die?

02:37.256 --> 02:39.497
I haven't really thought about it.

02:39.641 --> 02:40.841
- Um...

02:41.532 --> 02:42.732
Maybe you should.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.412
Children's Ward.

02:54.580 --> 02:55.780
Good luck.

03:12.676 --> 03:13.876
Hi,

03:14.067 --> 03:16.167
I'm Tom.
- We'll call you New Boy.

03:16.518 --> 03:17.718
I'm Amber.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.035
I'm in charge.
Is that clear?

03:20.995 --> 03:22.195
Good.

03:22.491 --> 03:24.857
Robin, from the sound
of your voice I'd say

03:24.858 --> 03:27.198
you were seven foot tall
with an Afro.

03:28.148 --> 03:30.608
- Not exactly.
- We both know I'm right.

03:30.874 --> 03:33.702
- I'm George and I'm the smart,
and the handsome,

03:33.703 --> 03:34.903
and the clever one.

03:38.201 --> 03:41.861
- Who's that? - That's Sally,
but you're not to disturb her.

03:44.347 --> 03:45.607
- She looks really ill.

03:45.958 --> 03:48.358
- Maybe you should mind your own business.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.098
Aren't there any toys or games?

03:52.277 --> 03:54.377
No, Matron doesn't believe in them.

03:55.571 --> 03:57.251
- This is worse than school.

03:58.374 --> 03:59.989
What a, dump.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.012
Look at the state of this place.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.012
It's absolutely filthy.

04:06.916 --> 04:10.216
I mean, whoever's in charge
must really hate children.

04:10.265 --> 04:12.033
"Hate" is a strong word.

04:12.058 --> 04:13.840
I prefer to say detest.

04:14.245 --> 04:17.365
Children are just grown-ups
who are too lazy to grow up.

04:17.366 --> 04:20.315
I mean, look at you all,
just lying there.

04:20.339 --> 04:21.988
"Oh, I'm ill" oh,

04:22.179 --> 04:24.192
boo-hoo.
You must be Tom.

04:24.926 --> 04:27.237
- Yes, Matron.
- The world's worst cricketer!

04:29.467 --> 04:31.301
So where are your mummy and daddy?

04:31.302 --> 04:33.191
They work in the Middle East.

04:33.519 --> 04:37.636
Oh, they must have wanted to get
a long way away from you.

04:38.349 --> 04:41.356
George's parents are away
as well, aren't they, George?

04:41.357 --> 04:43.577
- Please don't.
- They're in prison,

04:44.252 --> 04:45.452
for theft.

04:46.534 --> 04:49.153
So if anything goes missing
on the ward, we'll know who to blame,

04:49.154 --> 04:51.604
won't we, George?
- That ain't not fair!

04:51.605 --> 04:53.585
That's a double negative, George,

04:53.669 --> 04:56.387
like your mum and dad.
Now, rules to my ward.

04:56.388 --> 04:58.286
No running, no laughing,

04:58.536 --> 05:00.784
boys and girls visit the toilet
on alternate days

05:00.785 --> 05:03.245
except for Sundays,
when it's reserved as a footbath.

05:03.246 --> 05:05.581
No talking after lights out,
no crying.

05:05.582 --> 05:07.566
Everyone's in pain,
you're nothing special.

05:07.567 --> 05:09.208
"This", is your bed.

05:12.576 --> 05:14.848
I think that's meant for babies.

05:15.020 --> 05:16.520
Well, I'm looking at one.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.714
Did you bring pyjamas?
- Um...

05:18.715 --> 05:21.553
they brought me straight
from the cricket pitch, so no.

05:21.554 --> 05:22.754
No problem...

05:23.116 --> 05:25.336
we'll just try the lost property box.

05:34.557 --> 05:35.757
Hmm...

05:46.951 --> 05:48.151
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

05:50.390 --> 05:51.670
- There you are.

05:51.961 --> 05:53.161
- Oh,

05:53.617 --> 05:54.817
it...

05:54.842 --> 05:57.122
I don't think they're quite my colour.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.541
Would you like to be operated
on for no reason?

06:00.932 --> 06:03.332
- No.
- All it takes is one phone call.

06:03.372 --> 06:04.572
They'll be fine.

06:04.885 --> 06:07.789
- Good, I don't want to have to report
you to the head of the hospital.

06:07.790 --> 06:11.412
He's got no time for nasty
little ungrateful brats like you.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.732
Sir Quentin Strillers,
is an extremely busy man.

06:21.802 --> 06:23.575
Line seven...

06:29.684 --> 06:30.937
Come in!

06:31.562 --> 06:33.247
Oh, hello, Sir Quentin.

06:33.316 --> 06:35.452
You asked to see me
about something very urgent.

06:35.524 --> 06:36.724
- And your name is...

06:36.958 --> 06:38.158
Oh, Luppers.

06:38.372 --> 06:40.973
- And you are a...
- A doctor.

06:41.260 --> 06:42.460
At this hospital?

06:43.085 --> 06:45.977
- Yes. - Splendid, well,
as I'm sure you can appreciate,

06:45.978 --> 06:47.731
I am a very busy man.

06:47.819 --> 06:49.879
- You asked to see me.
- Did I?

06:50.121 --> 06:54.141
- Yes, I was told there were some
strange goings-on at the hospital.

06:54.465 --> 06:56.234
Ah, yes, Luppers.

06:56.782 --> 06:58.906
There's some strange goings-on

06:59.041 --> 07:01.562
going on, at this hospital.

07:02.468 --> 07:04.984
Unnatural goings on.

07:05.921 --> 07:07.121
Unnatural?

07:07.389 --> 07:10.293
Hospital equipment going missing,
boof - back again.

07:10.294 --> 07:12.731
Patients out of their bed
at the dead of night,

07:12.756 --> 07:15.797
strange noises from the cellar.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.398
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

07:18.143 --> 07:20.712
What are you doing tonight?
- It's my night off, sir.

07:20.713 --> 07:23.100
I haven't had one since
I started three weeks ago.

07:23.101 --> 07:25.556
Splendid, then you can investigate,
have a delve,

07:25.557 --> 07:28.137
let me know what you find out.
- Yes, sir.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.529
- Now, if you'll forgive me,

07:31.363 --> 07:33.103
I have got a hospital to run.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.076
Of course, sir.

07:46.905 --> 07:50.194
Beautiful...

08:02.763 --> 08:05.769
- You look like an ape at the zoo.
- You smell like one, too.

08:08.817 --> 08:10.528
- Laughter is forbidden!

08:10.529 --> 08:11.729
You are here...

08:12.192 --> 08:13.392
to be ill.

08:14.095 --> 08:15.295
Now,

08:15.595 --> 08:16.795
it's very late.

08:17.088 --> 08:18.888
Gosh, it's almost six o'clock.

08:19.751 --> 08:21.491
Lights out!
No talking.

08:22.666 --> 08:24.826
And if you have a medical emergency,

08:24.918 --> 08:26.118
do it quietly.

08:27.146 --> 08:28.346
Um, excuse me.

08:31.215 --> 08:32.414
Are you talking?

08:33.099 --> 08:35.179
Um... I'm just asking you a question.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.861
That is a subset of talking.

08:37.687 --> 08:40.687
I was wondering if my parents
have been in touch.

08:41.342 --> 08:42.543
No.

08:44.193 --> 08:46.280
Perhaps they just don't care about you.

08:46.281 --> 08:47.601
Or maybe they've died.

08:48.586 --> 08:50.566
Or it could be a mixture of both.

08:51.005 --> 08:52.205
Sweet dreams.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.106
Sorry, Tom,

09:01.378 --> 09:03.418
you must be missing them.
- Yeah.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.900
I'm at boarding school,

09:05.134 --> 09:07.745
I just don't see them very much.
- I can still hear talking!

09:54.674 --> 09:56.160
- Psst!
George!

09:57.038 --> 09:58.474
- Shut up!

09:59.469 --> 10:01.215
- Give me a sweet.
- No!

10:01.567 --> 10:02.767
I'm starving!

10:02.959 --> 10:05.239
Don't, Tom, you will spoil everything.

10:05.982 --> 10:08.781
Just a little one,
I don't mind if it's marzipan.

10:08.782 --> 10:09.982
I said no!

10:12.652 --> 10:13.852
Who was that?!

10:14.500 --> 10:17.482
I heard somebody "scoffing"!

10:20.085 --> 10:21.778
Was it you, George?

10:23.932 --> 10:25.132
I was as,

10:25.296 --> 10:26.496
quiet,

10:26.589 --> 10:27.713
as a mouse.

10:27.737 --> 10:29.131
- "I was as..."

10:29.132 --> 10:30.786
"quiet as a mouse."

10:31.543 --> 10:34.560
Then what have you got
in your fat, greedy gob?

10:35.052 --> 10:36.252
Nothing, Matron.

10:42.827 --> 10:44.982
You disgusting hog.

10:48.297 --> 10:49.497
Spit!

10:54.954 --> 10:57.702
You were told, no chocolates
after your operation.

10:57.703 --> 11:00.823
But no, you just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

11:03.253 --> 11:04.573
These are confiscated.

11:05.936 --> 11:07.136
Now, back to sleep,

11:07.613 --> 11:08.813
all of you!

11:16.103 --> 11:17.303
Are you asleep?

11:29.337 --> 11:31.182
I'm, so sorry.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.860
Bit late for that now, isn't it?

11:53.729 --> 11:54.929
- Finished work?

11:55.895 --> 11:57.095
Home now.

11:57.180 --> 11:59.933
- Lucky you, Strillers has me up
all night investigating

12:00.114 --> 12:01.791
strange goings-on.

12:03.054 --> 12:04.669
I'm sure it's nonsense.

12:04.694 --> 12:06.134
- You're absolutely right.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.657
Though don't let it see you.

12:08.739 --> 12:10.822
Oh, I won't.
What... let...

12:11.118 --> 12:12.318
what see me?

12:12.571 --> 12:15.088
The folks swear blind there's a ghost

12:15.504 --> 12:17.304
haunts the lower ground floor.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.041
But you don't want to know about that.

12:20.042 --> 12:23.197
No... Well, maybe I want
to know a little bit...?

12:23.670 --> 12:24.870
The story goes,

12:25.739 --> 12:30.135
a junior doctor made a fatal mistake
in the operating theatre,

12:30.360 --> 12:32.760
patient came back
from beyond the grave

12:33.281 --> 12:34.635
to eat the hearts

12:35.011 --> 12:38.361
and drink the brains,
of junior doctors.

12:38.698 --> 12:39.898
Golly.

12:41.255 --> 12:42.575
It's probably nothing.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.675
I mean,
how do you even drink a brain?

12:46.720 --> 12:48.697
Squish it up, I suppose.

12:50.932 --> 12:52.132
Goodnight.

12:55.335 --> 12:56.535
Goodnight.

13:44.399 --> 13:47.494
Why can't I find anyone as evil as me?

13:49.630 --> 13:53.142
Why must I always eat chocolates alone?

14:12.760 --> 14:13.960
Get to, George.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.514
Did you plan that all along?

14:26.741 --> 14:28.743
- Yep.
- Where are you going?

14:28.798 --> 14:30.718
Mind your own business, New Boy.

14:30.844 --> 14:32.524
Oh, what can that be?

14:34.382 --> 14:35.582
Are we safe?

14:35.648 --> 14:36.848
Should be.

14:36.873 --> 14:39.336
I put a sleeping pill
in each of the chocolates,

14:39.337 --> 14:42.177
except for the purple ones,
because they're my favourites.

14:44.268 --> 14:47.208
- You've seen nothing...
- Other than my genius.

14:58.843 --> 15:00.043
Argh!

15:05.313 --> 15:06.953
Where are you off to?

15:08.263 --> 15:10.723
- Nowhere.
- You can't be going nowhere,

15:10.868 --> 15:13.791
you must be going somewhere.
- We have to be quiet.

15:13.792 --> 15:14.992
We really don't.

15:15.257 --> 15:17.600
La-la-la!
They do this every night,

15:17.601 --> 15:19.625
that cow won't wake for hours.

15:20.513 --> 15:23.118
- Perhaps you should get some rest.
- Boring.

15:23.259 --> 15:25.119
I never get to do anything fun.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.093
Take me with you.
- Um...

15:27.246 --> 15:30.223
I'm just going to find the others,
to tell them to come straight back.

15:30.224 --> 15:32.273
- Liar.
- I'm not. - Are.

15:32.438 --> 15:35.995
And you aren't even a good liar.
You think I'll slow you down?

15:35.996 --> 15:38.758
- No. - I might be sick,
but I'm not stupid.

15:43.645 --> 15:45.145
Can I ask you a question?

15:47.143 --> 15:48.745
Why don't you have any hair?

15:48.746 --> 15:51.986
I shaved it all off, so I
could look like a Malteser.

15:55.469 --> 15:57.269
Is it because of your illness?

15:57.503 --> 15:58.703
It's the treatment.

16:00.438 --> 16:02.089
Will you get better?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.276
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

16:11.873 --> 16:13.793
I'll take you with me next time.

16:13.948 --> 16:15.928
The others never took me, either.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.581
Go on, then,
but promise me something.

16:20.265 --> 16:21.945
- Yes?
- When you get back,

16:22.352 --> 16:24.512
I want you to tell me
all about it.

16:24.719 --> 16:25.919
OK.

16:26.905 --> 16:28.105
- And by the way,

16:28.694 --> 16:31.994
there are clean pyjamas
in the drawer behind your bed.

16:32.555 --> 16:33.755
Thanks.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.444
- <i>"Folks swear blind there's a ghost"</i>

16:47.445 --> 16:49.365
<i>"haunts the lower ground floor."</i>

17:01.231 --> 17:03.554
<i>"A junior doctor made a fatal"</i>

17:03.579 --> 17:05.799
<i>"mistake in the operating theatre..."</i>

17:05.997 --> 17:07.196
This is ridiculous!

17:07.368 --> 17:09.393
<i>"in the operating theatre..."</i>

17:10.031 --> 17:11.970
I'm a fully qualified doctor,

17:12.272 --> 17:13.473
not Scooby-Doo!

17:14.045 --> 17:15.244
A ghost, indeed!

17:25.196 --> 17:27.597
- I'm thirsty for more brain.

18:00.129 --> 18:01.329
- George!

18:02.769 --> 18:04.932
- What are you doing here?
- What are "you" doing here?

18:04.933 --> 18:07.364
It's got nothing to do
with The Midnight Gang.

18:07.365 --> 18:09.128
- The what?
- Shhh!

18:09.315 --> 18:11.027
Don't ruin Amber's dream.

18:13.562 --> 18:16.183
- And finally,here we are,

18:16.453 --> 18:19.355
after trekking through miles of ice

18:19.432 --> 18:21.894
and snow, I am the

18:22.128 --> 18:24.675
very first girl

18:25.075 --> 18:27.917
to reach the North Pole!
- Woo-hoo!

18:31.154 --> 18:32.714
What's New Boy doing here?

18:33.339 --> 18:34.899
- This is amazing!

18:35.208 --> 18:36.761
Can I join your gang?

18:36.808 --> 18:37.932
No!

18:38.642 --> 18:40.237
- Everyone, hide!

18:51.443 --> 18:52.823
All right, little 'uns.

18:52.938 --> 18:54.095
Porter?!

18:55.459 --> 18:56.659
He helps us.

18:56.964 --> 19:00.684
It's amazing what you can do
with a little bit of imagination

19:00.770 --> 19:03.898
and the ice off some frozen
fish finger packets.

19:03.923 --> 19:05.123
It was wonderful.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.116
This is so cool!

19:07.298 --> 19:09.314
I want to know everything.

19:09.594 --> 19:12.080
- If you tell anyone
about The Midnight Gang,

19:12.081 --> 19:14.601
anyone at all,
you'll end up in hospital.

19:16.743 --> 19:17.943
I am in hospital.

19:18.974 --> 19:20.174
Oh, yeah.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.332
Well, seeing as George
has given the game away,

19:23.333 --> 19:24.701
you might as well know.

19:24.702 --> 19:29.041
The Midnight Gang has been making
wishes come true in this hospital

19:29.853 --> 19:31.947
for near on 50 years.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.127
It doesn't matter if you want
to be an ancient explorer...

19:48.022 --> 19:50.542
Or if you want to be
a ballroom dancer...

20:04.543 --> 20:05.863
Or be a racing driver!

20:17.628 --> 20:18.828
- Last Friday,

20:19.379 --> 20:21.839
it was Robin's turn.
- I'm very musical.

20:22.144 --> 20:24.181
I don't want to blow my own trumpet,

20:24.182 --> 20:26.680
but I really can blow
my own trumpet.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.350
My dream was to conduct an orchestra.

20:30.392 --> 20:33.272
Naturally, they all played
medical instruments.

20:52.508 --> 20:53.708
My turn's tomorrow.

20:54.223 --> 20:55.538
- George wants to fly!

20:57.630 --> 20:59.509
- Why's that funny?
- Come on, George.

20:59.510 --> 21:00.710
It's impossible.

21:02.084 --> 21:05.444
- Nothing's impossible
for The Midnight Gang.

21:05.845 --> 21:07.963
Come on, you lot,
back to your beds.

21:07.964 --> 21:11.084
I'm going to get my blowtorch
and start to defrost.

21:11.629 --> 21:12.829
Thanks, Porter.

21:12.949 --> 21:14.149
That was amazing.

21:14.241 --> 21:16.341
Oh, it was my pleasure, young Miss.

21:16.596 --> 21:18.936
Anything to make you little 'uns happy.

21:26.511 --> 21:28.056
- Oh, this isn't our floor.

21:28.057 --> 21:29.376
Oh, we're busted.

21:36.528 --> 21:38.905
What are you kids doing up so late?

21:40.454 --> 21:41.654
We're not.

21:41.796 --> 21:42.996
You're imagining us.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.835
- Imagining us. Imagining us...

21:47.961 --> 21:50.234
I ain't got no imagination.

21:50.913 --> 21:52.113
Out!

21:57.348 --> 21:58.548
So...?

21:58.749 --> 21:59.949
- Um...
- Eh...

22:00.226 --> 22:02.206
we're top-secret dirt inspectors.

22:02.331 --> 22:03.571
You what?!

22:04.173 --> 22:07.572
Yes, we're checking you're cleaning
the floors properly.

22:07.573 --> 22:08.773
- You've got an F,

22:08.967 --> 22:10.167
for "filthy".

22:17.256 --> 22:19.500
You can't even see nothing.

22:19.692 --> 22:23.163
- It's all done by smell.
When did you last change that water?

22:23.164 --> 22:24.364
- Last Tuesday.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.495
Good for another week yet.

22:27.449 --> 22:30.573
Aren't you a bit young to be inspectors?

22:31.524 --> 22:34.275
Children are best because
we're closer to the ground.

22:34.276 --> 22:36.556
We can see dirt more easily.
Goodbye.

22:49.539 --> 22:51.397
- Yummy, yummy

22:51.588 --> 22:52.788
chocolate...

22:54.076 --> 22:55.320
Shoes!

23:00.668 --> 23:02.648
Where did you go this time, then?

23:03.239 --> 23:05.759
- Nowhere.
- You can't have been nowhere.

23:06.033 --> 23:07.713
It must have been somewhere.

23:08.427 --> 23:09.867
Sally, go back to sleep.

23:10.270 --> 23:13.715
- You'll wake Matron. - Tom promised
he'd tell me about the adventure.

23:13.716 --> 23:15.944
Well, I didn't exactly promise.

23:16.067 --> 23:17.267
You're a liar!

23:17.720 --> 23:19.460
I thought you were different.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.368
But you're just as bad as the others.

23:28.576 --> 23:31.226
- <i>Dr Oliver, please come to reception.</i>

23:32.549 --> 23:35.669
I ain't afraid of no ghost,
I ain't afraid of no...

23:36.839 --> 23:38.519
I thought you were a doctor.

23:39.538 --> 23:40.738
Oh, yes. I...

23:41.897 --> 23:43.097
I am.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.074
Did you know that there
have been more goings on

23:46.075 --> 23:47.815
going on in the night?

23:47.932 --> 23:50.279
Freezer room,
even stranger than before.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.334
What are you doing tonight?
- Oh, you know,

23:52.335 --> 23:54.795
sleeping, crying.
- Ah, splendid. No plans,

23:54.796 --> 23:57.088
then you can be on patrol again.

23:57.953 --> 23:59.153
And, Luppers,

23:59.547 --> 24:01.564
the truth, is out there.

24:11.405 --> 24:13.747
- La-la-la!

24:13.748 --> 24:15.978
La-la, la-la-la-la!

24:16.241 --> 24:18.446
Good morning
and good morning

24:18.476 --> 24:21.009
and good morning, children.

24:21.355 --> 24:23.532
Rise and shine.

24:23.599 --> 24:25.459
- Good morning, Tootsie.
- Ah!

24:26.629 --> 24:28.909
I see we have a new patient.
- Hello.

24:29.506 --> 24:31.486
I'm Tom.
- Good morning, Thomas,

24:31.640 --> 24:34.369
and what a good morning
it is that the Lord has given us.

24:34.370 --> 24:36.290
Now what would you like
for breakfast?

24:36.291 --> 24:38.501
- What have you got?
- Everything!

24:39.364 --> 24:40.564
Everything?

24:42.116 --> 24:44.970
Everything.
Whatever your heart desires.

24:45.429 --> 24:46.629
Oh, great.

24:46.821 --> 24:50.454
Can I please have waffles
with cold vanilla ice cream

24:50.501 --> 24:53.931
and two jam doughnuts
covered in chocolate

24:54.061 --> 24:55.525
and whipped cream?

24:55.647 --> 24:57.387
I've got toast or cornflakes.

25:00.097 --> 25:02.681
- Oh.
- Cutbacks, I'm afraid, Thomas.

25:03.726 --> 25:06.303
- I see.
- But it makes the patients happy

25:06.304 --> 25:09.123
to think they can have whatever
their heart's desire.

25:09.124 --> 25:10.245
But they can't?

25:10.269 --> 25:13.029
They can, if they desire
toast or cornflakes.

25:13.509 --> 25:15.480
- Toast, please.
- I'm out of toast.

25:15.481 --> 25:16.681
Cornflakes?

25:17.092 --> 25:18.292
Yes, OK.

25:23.261 --> 25:24.461
Now...

25:25.872 --> 25:27.611
I don't have any milk,
so

25:27.829 --> 25:29.744
how about, a drop

25:29.921 --> 25:31.121
of cold tea?

25:31.845 --> 25:33.197
- Super.
- Ah!

25:33.763 --> 25:34.963
Yes.

25:34.994 --> 25:36.674
Mm!

25:37.761 --> 25:39.392
Oh! Mm!

25:40.692 --> 25:41.892
Here.

25:43.638 --> 25:46.818
Sally, I've brought you an
iced bun from the bakery.

25:47.085 --> 25:48.345
- Thank you, Tootsie,

25:48.655 --> 25:50.815
but I think I can
only manage half.

25:51.294 --> 25:54.294
- I'll save it for later.
- I'll have it, thanks.

25:59.964 --> 26:01.431
Good morning, Matron.

26:01.592 --> 26:03.150
- Out!
- Oh, dear.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.419
Somebody hasn't had
their morning coffee.

26:05.420 --> 26:07.150
I won't say it twice.

26:07.242 --> 26:08.442
You won't have to.

26:10.645 --> 26:12.423
I know it was you lot

26:12.475 --> 26:14.962
causing havoc downstairs
last night.

26:15.943 --> 26:18.763
I just had a call on the telephone.
They found

26:19.200 --> 26:20.751
tiny footprints

26:20.941 --> 26:22.423
in the freezer room.

26:22.645 --> 26:25.994
- Oh, really?
- You are all in big trouble!

26:28.141 --> 26:30.712
I'm calling Sir Quentin right away.

26:31.012 --> 26:32.212
It wasn't them.

26:34.191 --> 26:35.391
What do you know?

26:35.616 --> 26:39.440
- I couldn't sleep a wink last night,
but everyone else was asleep

26:39.441 --> 26:40.641
the whole time.

26:41.598 --> 26:43.587
So it couldn't have been them.

26:47.511 --> 26:48.711
Swear it?!

26:52.154 --> 26:54.837
I swear on my hamster's life.

26:58.443 --> 27:00.962
- I'll be watching all of you

27:01.059 --> 27:02.519
very closely,

27:03.250 --> 27:05.212
and I am sending you

27:05.237 --> 27:08.008
and your pathetic little
bump to the doctor.

27:08.586 --> 27:11.226
I'm sure he will discharge
you immediately.

27:12.182 --> 27:15.058
Your headmaster wants
you back at school.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.851
Thanks for that one, Sally.

27:31.987 --> 27:33.347
- Hm, no problem.

27:33.673 --> 27:36.137
I..., I'm sorry you had to swear
on your hamster's life.

27:36.546 --> 27:37.745
That's OK.

27:37.932 --> 27:39.312
I don't have a hamster.

27:41.122 --> 27:43.941
- Tom,
I have some very good news.

27:44.612 --> 27:45.812
Really?

27:46.321 --> 27:49.073
You are, 100% better.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.640
Do you know what this means?

27:52.680 --> 27:53.880
I've cured someone!

27:54.599 --> 27:55.859
Who would've thought?

27:56.172 --> 27:57.732
You can go back to school.

27:58.195 --> 27:59.395
- Oh!

27:59.454 --> 28:00.535
What?!

28:00.559 --> 28:01.819
Something the matter?

28:02.301 --> 28:04.988
I've just made some really
good friends on the ward.

28:05.013 --> 28:06.832
Well, two words.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.600
"Pen pals".

28:09.711 --> 28:10.911
Or is it one word?

28:12.020 --> 28:15.300
Anyway, pop this in for
a final temperature check,

28:15.348 --> 28:17.675
and I will let the Matron know
that you are good to go.

28:17.676 --> 28:20.850
- Ah, wait! But..., but
we never finished the questionnaire.

28:21.374 --> 28:22.574
Oh, yes.

28:22.901 --> 28:25.230
Good point.
Yeah, hang on. Right.

28:25.363 --> 28:29.023
"Would you say that the music
in the lift was too relaxing,"

28:29.357 --> 28:30.557
"relaxing,"

28:30.929 --> 28:32.129
"too exciting,"

28:32.518 --> 28:35.433
"or made you feel, off your nut?"

28:35.802 --> 28:37.799
- I'm ill.
- Well...,

28:38.588 --> 28:39.788
you look fine.

28:40.259 --> 28:41.459
Let's see.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.006
Oh, no.

28:46.557 --> 28:47.757
Oh, no!

28:48.262 --> 28:51.775
This is the highest temperature
ever recorded in a human being.

28:51.776 --> 28:54.144
Am I well enough for school?

28:54.274 --> 28:55.972
No! No, no!

28:56.019 --> 28:59.051
We have to get you straight back
to the ward as soon as possible.

28:59.052 --> 29:01.332
This is medical history in the making.

29:01.759 --> 29:02.959
Porter!

29:11.066 --> 29:12.737
Take it easy, Master Tom.

29:14.197 --> 29:15.550
See you all later.

29:16.056 --> 29:18.456
Tonight, I'm going to fly like an eagle.

29:22.725 --> 29:24.945
So, how are you going to make me fly?

29:24.990 --> 29:27.612
My idea is still undergoing refinement.

29:27.924 --> 29:29.587
Ha! I knew you didn't know.

29:33.959 --> 29:35.740
- Time to go for your treatment.

29:35.741 --> 29:36.941
Do I have to?

29:37.455 --> 29:40.943
- You're not here to have fun.
This isn't Alton Towers.

29:42.955 --> 29:45.323
Come on, come on, come on!
Hurry up.

29:50.761 --> 29:52.381
I know how you could do it.

29:52.986 --> 29:55.026
I really don't need any help,
but

29:55.519 --> 29:57.439
if you insist,
you may tell me.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.974
But I'm not a member of
The Midnight Gang,

29:59.975 --> 30:01.175
so I can't.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.767
You can have a temporary membership.

30:10.918 --> 30:12.118
On a junior basis.

30:14.623 --> 30:18.333
- So this is what we need to do.
So we need to get all the...

30:27.348 --> 30:28.548
- Om,

30:28.573 --> 30:29.773
nom, nom!

30:31.684 --> 30:33.130
- Om, om!

30:35.821 --> 30:38.165
- You're at it again.
That's it!

30:38.166 --> 30:40.310
I'm calling the Amputation Department.

30:40.311 --> 30:41.511
Please, don't!

30:43.471 --> 30:44.791
These are impounded...,

30:45.948 --> 30:47.268
till further notice.

30:56.257 --> 30:57.780
- Om, nom, nom!

31:00.673 --> 31:02.944
- Yummy chocolate!

31:05.352 --> 31:07.092
- Oh, sleepy time.

31:49.611 --> 31:50.802
Raj!

31:50.826 --> 31:52.852
Uh-huh, George!

31:53.325 --> 31:55.328
My favourite customer.

31:55.470 --> 31:59.610
- What are you doing here?
- I had a third-degree stapling accident.

31:59.908 --> 32:01.528
Oh, they can be very nasty.

32:01.740 --> 32:04.860
Newsagent's job is the most
dangerous job there is.

32:05.167 --> 32:07.831
I've lost many good
colleagues to paper cuts.

32:07.832 --> 32:09.516
I like what you've done with the place.

32:09.517 --> 32:11.977
What do you desire?
Chocolates, flowers,

32:12.379 --> 32:13.579
get-well cards?

32:13.864 --> 32:16.144
Prewritten cards
are very good value,

32:16.224 --> 32:18.463
especially if your name
is Auntie Deepta

32:18.464 --> 32:20.562
and you want to send
a card to a Raj.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.533
We need, balloons.

32:22.868 --> 32:25.781
We want to make this sick
boy's dream come true.

32:25.782 --> 32:29.125
Well, then, the cupboard
on the right below the Panda Pops.

32:29.126 --> 32:30.501
You are welcome to them.

32:30.502 --> 32:33.008
By "welcome", do you mean you're not
going to charge us for them?

32:33.009 --> 32:36.633
Ah, they are being used to let
a young boy's dream come true.

32:36.634 --> 32:38.074
I want you to have them.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.808
- You're a good man.

32:41.228 --> 32:42.775
They're £12.50.

33:05.845 --> 33:07.364
How are you getting on, Doctor?

33:07.600 --> 33:09.160
I've found nothing at all.

33:10.130 --> 33:12.578
- There isn't a ghost.
- I'm sure you're right.

33:12.579 --> 33:15.099
I remember that's what
Dr Wilson thought.

33:15.204 --> 33:16.404
Who's Dr Wilson?

33:16.469 --> 33:18.209
The junior doctor before you.

33:18.649 --> 33:21.227
They found him
on this very ward,

33:21.408 --> 33:23.628
with a hole
at the side of his head,

33:23.770 --> 33:25.423
and by his lifeless body,

33:25.940 --> 33:27.602
an empty juice bottle.

33:28.511 --> 33:29.711
And a note.

33:30.978 --> 33:32.178
W-w-what...?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.880
- What did it say?
- Yeah.

33:35.072 --> 33:36.272
It said,

33:36.524 --> 33:38.624
"Thank you for the brain smoothie."

33:39.599 --> 33:40.799
"Yum-yum."

33:41.184 --> 33:44.544
I need to go to the toilet
as a matter of some urgency.

33:48.288 --> 33:50.321
That's got rid of him.
Come.

33:52.945 --> 33:54.745
Right, I think we have enough.

33:55.538 --> 33:56.738
- Oh, my!

33:57.336 --> 33:59.188
What beautiful balloons.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.827
Are they meant for me?
- Come on.

34:02.535 --> 34:05.516
That's Nelly.
She's 99 years old

34:05.746 --> 34:08.087
and she has no family left alive.

34:08.409 --> 34:11.949
I've never seen such beautiful
balloons in all of my life.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.306
Who sent them?
Was it Daddy?

34:15.462 --> 34:17.195
She think she's a little girl.

34:17.196 --> 34:18.976
I do hope it was Daddy.

34:20.598 --> 34:21.918
I miss him ever so.

34:24.774 --> 34:26.034
I know how she feels.

34:30.661 --> 34:31.862
Oh!

34:33.070 --> 34:34.270
Yes, Nelly,

34:34.719 --> 34:38.139
your daddy wants you to have this.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

34:38.335 --> 34:40.495
Did he say when he would pick me up?

34:41.143 --> 34:43.433
Soon.
He said he'd come soon.

34:43.687 --> 34:44.887
Oh, goody!

34:45.647 --> 34:46.967
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

34:54.739 --> 34:55.940
Oh!

35:00.095 --> 35:01.535
- Right, give them over.

35:01.783 --> 35:03.742
I'm going to fly like an ostrich.

35:03.743 --> 35:06.457
- Ostriches don't fly.
- This one does.

35:15.033 --> 35:17.596
- I'm not lifting.
- We're one balloon short.

35:17.597 --> 35:21.371
Oh, it's almost as if "someone"
decided to give one away!

35:21.839 --> 35:24.463
- There aren't any more.
- Actually, there is one.

35:24.464 --> 35:25.664
Wait here.

35:31.271 --> 35:33.971
I suppose you're here
to ask for my balloon?

35:35.756 --> 35:39.776
- How did you know? - How else
are you going to get George to fly?

35:42.341 --> 35:45.099
- Thanks, Sally.
- If I can't go on adventures,

35:45.100 --> 35:46.540
at least my balloon can.

35:48.863 --> 35:50.402
- Here we go.
- Thank you!

35:53.685 --> 35:56.528
Wa-hey, I'm flying!
- Whoa! Whoa!

35:56.827 --> 35:58.833
- Wahey!
- OK. - Not yet.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.117
We have to be able to get
you back to Earth.

36:01.118 --> 36:04.046
Someone has to go to the top
of the stairs and catch him.

36:04.047 --> 36:05.403
It's a lot of stairs.

36:05.752 --> 36:07.492
Thanks for volunteering, Tom.

36:09.238 --> 36:12.403
Just so you know, Robin,
I'm giving you a look.

36:17.100 --> 36:19.145
- Some people are born

36:19.287 --> 36:20.903
to witness history,

36:20.928 --> 36:22.928
some, to make it.

36:23.243 --> 36:25.381
One of us is about to become

36:25.673 --> 36:26.933
the first man,

36:27.295 --> 36:28.495
to fly.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.724
- OK, I'm ready.

36:34.890 --> 36:37.590
Please, could I swap
this one for a red one?

36:38.225 --> 36:39.425
- Oh!

36:39.678 --> 36:41.336
- My balloons!
Give them back!

36:41.337 --> 36:43.601
- Oh, she's going too fast.

36:43.602 --> 36:46.371
- I'm guessing she might be
a tiny bit lighter than George.

36:46.372 --> 36:50.474
- Tom, you're going to have to catch
Nelly before she flies past!

36:51.717 --> 36:52.917
- Help!

36:55.183 --> 36:56.383
- Yippee!

36:56.944 --> 36:58.555
- Let's get after her.

36:59.097 --> 37:00.297
- Oh...,

37:00.584 --> 37:01.784
Big Ben!

37:01.860 --> 37:03.060
Oh!

37:05.128 --> 37:08.282
Oh, look at the lights.
Can you see me?

37:10.498 --> 37:12.658
If you see the old girl, just shout.

37:14.930 --> 37:16.883
Right, let's go!

37:17.148 --> 37:19.821
- Yee-hah!
- Hold on tight.

37:21.374 --> 37:22.574
- Yes!

37:32.326 --> 37:33.526
Straight ahead!

37:33.774 --> 37:35.814
- Hello down there!

37:36.132 --> 37:37.332
Ooh!

37:42.909 --> 37:44.624
- Cooeee!

37:56.720 --> 37:59.213
- Oh, it's so pretty.

37:59.307 --> 38:01.759
Oh! St Paul's!

38:02.513 --> 38:03.963
Oh, my goodness!

38:04.218 --> 38:06.541
Oh, I hope I'm not going to crash.

38:06.895 --> 38:08.095
Ooh!

38:08.971 --> 38:10.171
Oh, dear.

38:10.308 --> 38:12.127
Oh, I'm in the nuddy!

38:13.629 --> 38:16.449
- Well, I'm scarred for life.
- Whee!

38:17.031 --> 38:18.231
Oh!

38:18.514 --> 38:20.854
- Stop that naked pensioner!

38:20.944 --> 38:22.144
Oh!

38:25.417 --> 38:26.617
- Oh!

38:26.692 --> 38:27.892
Oh, I say!

38:28.326 --> 38:29.526
Oh!

38:29.678 --> 38:31.478
Oh, look at all these pigeons.

38:31.817 --> 38:33.301
Oh, my goodness!

38:33.616 --> 38:35.236
- Oh, no!

38:36.036 --> 38:38.392
- Whee!

38:40.361 --> 38:42.519
Oh, this is comfy.

38:49.413 --> 38:50.613
Oh!

38:50.880 --> 38:52.768
I think this is going to look...

38:56.106 --> 38:57.306
Horrendous!

38:59.317 --> 39:03.110
If there's one thing I've learnt
running a hospital for 30 years,

39:03.111 --> 39:05.737
other than you can charge
what you like for car parking,

39:05.738 --> 39:07.863
it's that you don't leave

39:07.868 --> 39:09.956
naked patients dangling

39:10.094 --> 39:12.027
off statues.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.183
How's Nelly doing, sir?

39:15.241 --> 39:18.195
- Well, she wants to know when she
can fly again. - Never!

39:18.196 --> 39:21.147
- She isn't even a member of
The Midnight Gang! - Uh!

39:21.148 --> 39:22.948
- "Midnight" what?
- Nothing.

39:23.025 --> 39:25.261
Drugging a member of staff,

39:25.561 --> 39:27.688
stealing another patient's property,

39:27.689 --> 39:30.113
damaging a valuable

39:30.270 --> 39:31.995
asbestos ceiling...

39:32.057 --> 39:34.128
Making me clean the hospital.

39:34.818 --> 39:38.418
Dilly, it is probably better
if the hospital is kept clean.

39:38.824 --> 39:40.504
- It's all my fault.

39:41.295 --> 39:42.555
I was the ringleader.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.316
No, I was the ringleader.

39:45.505 --> 39:46.705
No, I was.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.620
I wasn't.

39:50.298 --> 39:51.498
Sir Quentin,

39:52.152 --> 39:53.352
it was me.

39:53.863 --> 39:55.980
I'm solely, to blame.

39:56.105 --> 39:57.231
I knew it!

39:57.255 --> 39:59.955
- Please, it's not true.
- Porter! - Matron,

40:01.698 --> 40:03.050
send these

40:04.011 --> 40:05.211
children

40:05.398 --> 40:06.598
back to their ward.

40:07.108 --> 40:08.956
With pleasure, Sir Quentin.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.980
Now, you deceitful little beasts!

40:19.365 --> 40:22.509
- I find it unbelievable
that you allowed the behaviour

40:22.510 --> 40:24.614
of the children
to go on in this way!

40:24.615 --> 40:27.060
You are a responsible adult...

40:29.404 --> 40:31.099
Get out!

40:50.703 --> 40:53.665
- Good morning
and good morning

40:53.690 --> 40:55.310
and good morning.

40:55.552 --> 40:57.622
I have everything for breakfast.

40:58.147 --> 41:00.171
Toast or cornflake.

41:01.590 --> 41:05.250
What is the matter with all
you kiddie-winkies this morning?

41:05.654 --> 41:08.109
They are sitting in a damp

41:08.341 --> 41:09.901
puddle of their own guilt.

41:10.183 --> 41:12.367
They broke every rule in the hospital.

41:12.368 --> 41:14.511
- But they seem
like such a nice bunch.

41:14.512 --> 41:15.913
No, don't be fooled.

41:16.396 --> 41:18.316
They even got the porter sacked.

41:19.544 --> 41:22.714
But the porter has been here longer
than anyone can remember.

41:22.715 --> 41:26.654
I heard his mother abandoned him
on the hospital steps as a baby.

41:26.655 --> 41:28.687
- Well, who can blame her?

41:28.688 --> 41:31.552
I mean, who'd want to look at
a baby that frightful?

41:31.553 --> 41:33.296
Oh, the poor, poor man.

41:33.619 --> 41:35.059
I must try and find him.

41:35.204 --> 41:37.388
He deserves not an ounce of sympathy.

41:37.389 --> 41:40.569
He is as ugly on the inside
as he is on the outside.

41:41.271 --> 41:42.471
Off!

41:44.579 --> 41:45.779
Tootsie...

41:48.691 --> 41:50.071
If you find the porter,

41:50.850 --> 41:52.468
can you tell him I'm so,

41:53.236 --> 41:54.436
so sorry.

41:55.195 --> 41:56.395
I will try.

42:00.673 --> 42:01.873
Well...,

42:02.803 --> 42:05.443
The Midnight Gang
was good while it lasted.

42:05.792 --> 42:06.992
It can't end yet.

42:07.577 --> 42:11.177
There's still a member who hasn't
had their wish come true.

42:12.614 --> 42:13.814
You.

42:13.886 --> 42:16.945
Although, can it be
something really easy?

42:17.236 --> 42:19.366
It needs to be very unambitious.

42:19.461 --> 42:23.001
Like, have you always dreamt
of lying in a hospital bed...

42:24.455 --> 42:26.429
staring at a blank wall?

42:29.147 --> 42:30.347
Actually...,

42:31.454 --> 42:33.974
I'd like to give my wish
to someone else.

42:34.605 --> 42:35.805
Who?

42:35.957 --> 42:37.157
Sally.

42:37.685 --> 42:40.985
She wants to be in The Midnight
Gang more than anyone,

42:41.108 --> 42:42.972
but we kept telling her she couldn't.

42:42.973 --> 42:45.133
We didn't want to make her more ill.

42:47.819 --> 42:48.938
But...,

42:48.962 --> 42:51.362
we should all have one dream
come true,

42:51.853 --> 42:53.053
shouldn't we?

42:54.028 --> 42:55.228
Sally.

42:55.478 --> 42:57.679
Thank you for giving me your wish, Tom.

42:57.680 --> 42:58.841
What is it?

42:58.865 --> 43:00.425
We can't wait to find out.

43:02.250 --> 43:03.450
The thing is,

43:04.032 --> 43:06.795
I don't know
if I'll ever get out

43:06.820 --> 43:08.020
of this hospital.

43:10.236 --> 43:12.038
My dream is to live
a big,

43:12.613 --> 43:13.813
beautiful life.

43:17.672 --> 43:18.872
Oh, Sally!

43:19.874 --> 43:21.074
It's a lovely wish.

43:22.708 --> 43:24.452
Well, it's hardly unambitious, is it?

43:24.453 --> 43:26.013
Did you not hear that bit?

43:26.038 --> 43:29.013
So, faker, guess whose
lab tests are back?

43:29.124 --> 43:31.636
Boy, I'm taking you straight back
to school,

43:31.637 --> 43:33.257
and I hope you get carsick.

43:33.323 --> 43:35.743
- No, please,
just one more night.

43:35.744 --> 43:37.713
Can't I say goodbye to my friends?!

43:37.714 --> 43:39.334
You don't have any friends.

43:39.935 --> 43:43.115
When we get back to school,
I will personally ensure

43:43.162 --> 43:45.538
that your life becomes
a waking nightmare.

43:45.539 --> 43:47.523
- How about I don't come back?

43:59.541 --> 44:00.741
- Run, Tom!
- Run!

44:03.449 --> 44:05.116
Boy, I'll get you, boy!

44:06.695 --> 44:07.895
- Run, Tom!
- Run!

44:08.382 --> 44:10.616
Boy, straight back up this instant!

44:44.652 --> 44:45.852
- Oh!

44:47.696 --> 44:50.636
- Welcome to my humble abode.
- Oh, you're back!

44:51.444 --> 44:53.477
Well, I missed my home comforts.

44:54.297 --> 44:55.497
Go in there.

44:56.438 --> 44:58.919
- Boy?
- He's not down there.

44:59.035 --> 45:00.235
- Boy!

45:00.260 --> 45:02.120
- You won't get away with this.

45:02.352 --> 45:04.940
Where are you, you wretched boy?

45:08.385 --> 45:10.118
Oh, look at all this junk.

45:10.143 --> 45:11.885
I've been in tidier riots.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.276
- That smell.

45:13.844 --> 45:15.044
It's very familiar.

45:15.356 --> 45:17.876
Let's go before I develop
a skin disease.

45:18.232 --> 45:21.172
It looks like the possessions
of a homeless man.

45:21.927 --> 45:25.374
I shall come back later and put
them all in the incinerator.

45:25.375 --> 45:28.573
- Cruel and callous,
a woman after my own heart.

45:30.198 --> 45:32.174
Do you hate animals too?

45:32.529 --> 45:34.401
Nearly as much as children.

45:34.746 --> 45:36.205
I can't bear children.

45:36.560 --> 45:39.242
- Literally or metaphorically?
- Metaphorically.

45:39.243 --> 45:41.315
We shall have to see
about literally.

45:41.316 --> 45:44.091
I open all the letters
the boys receive,

45:44.116 --> 45:45.737
I steal the book tokens

45:45.948 --> 45:47.328
and then burn the rest.

45:47.611 --> 45:50.268
The local church sends
my ward toys

45:50.302 --> 45:52.402
for the children.
I sell the toys,

45:52.790 --> 45:54.950
and I spend all the money
on shoes.

45:55.141 --> 45:58.701
Tom's parents have telephoned
the school every single day

45:58.726 --> 45:59.926
since his accident.

45:59.991 --> 46:02.031
I just put the phone down on them.

46:02.096 --> 46:04.616
Would you like to join
me this evening...

46:04.883 --> 46:06.143
for chocolate cake?

46:07.148 --> 46:08.635
Is it stolen cake?

46:09.546 --> 46:13.293
- Robin's parents sent it to me
to share amongst the children.

46:13.294 --> 46:15.976
- Then it'll taste all the sweeter!

46:21.560 --> 46:24.620
- What a lovely couple!
- I must invite them back.

46:25.831 --> 46:27.871
- Have you always lived down here?

46:28.977 --> 46:30.357
When I was a young 'un,

46:32.242 --> 46:33.442
the hospital

46:33.879 --> 46:36.073
tried all sorts of operations

46:36.684 --> 46:37.884
to make me look...

46:38.958 --> 46:41.478
presentable, but
they didn't really work.

46:43.377 --> 46:45.177
When I was 16, my time was up.

46:47.920 --> 46:49.120
I had to leave.

46:53.381 --> 46:55.001
I didn't like it out there.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.951
Sometimes people think
if you've got

46:59.058 --> 47:00.558
a stain
on your outside,

47:00.876 --> 47:03.396
you know, you have a
stain on the inside.

47:04.959 --> 47:06.338
I don't blame them.

47:07.902 --> 47:09.627
We're all scared of things

47:10.345 --> 47:11.963
we don't understand.

47:14.151 --> 47:15.351
But...,

47:15.568 --> 47:16.768
I found a job,

47:17.763 --> 47:20.112
and a place I could call home.

47:21.714 --> 47:22.974
And things looked up.

47:25.454 --> 47:26.654
It ain't fancy.

47:27.546 --> 47:29.369
But it meant I was on hand

47:29.748 --> 47:31.068
for The Midnight Gang.

47:31.250 --> 47:32.930
- Why do you always help them?

47:33.418 --> 47:36.238
- There's no reason.
- There must be a reason.

47:37.473 --> 47:39.513
I don't know what you're on about.

47:40.200 --> 47:43.602
- Maybe you were the one
who started it! - Me?

47:43.940 --> 47:47.245
- Yes! You were a patient here
all those years ago,

47:47.349 --> 47:49.331
bored and with nothing to do.

47:51.062 --> 47:54.422
You're a right little
Sherlock Holmes, you, aren't you?

47:56.251 --> 47:57.451
I am right,

47:57.737 --> 47:58.937
aren't I?

48:01.269 --> 48:02.469
Yes, Tom,

48:02.730 --> 48:03.930
you're right.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.800
I started The Midnight Gang.

48:10.012 --> 48:13.252
Just wanted to make the other
kids on the ward happy.

48:16.353 --> 48:18.333
And that's what I want for Sally.

48:19.355 --> 48:21.755
I said I would make
her wish come true,

48:21.970 --> 48:24.089
but it's impossible.
- Hey...,

48:25.130 --> 48:27.909
nothing's impossible
for The Midnight Gang.

48:28.584 --> 48:30.504
We've just got to work together.

48:31.836 --> 48:35.284
So let's sneak upstairs and get
the rest of the gang.

48:44.683 --> 48:45.883
- Uh-oh.

48:47.420 --> 48:48.620
Cleaners!

48:48.842 --> 48:50.042
Thank goodness.

48:50.191 --> 48:53.674
They unplugged my freezer,
because the nice lady in bed four

48:53.675 --> 48:56.069
needed her life-support
machine back on.

48:56.070 --> 48:58.830
But now the floor
is covered in Solero juice.

48:59.498 --> 49:02.660
- The thing is, we're not real cleaners.
- Sorry, Raj.

49:02.661 --> 49:06.721
Oh, in that case, can I interest
you in some ice lollies

49:06.824 --> 49:08.606
on very special offer?

49:09.816 --> 49:11.316
- Maybe later.

49:11.382 --> 49:12.582
We are on a mission.

49:14.211 --> 49:17.461
And 12 melted Twisters
for the price of

49:17.486 --> 49:18.987
11!

49:20.278 --> 49:21.478
- Mm.

49:21.535 --> 49:23.387
Scrumptious cake, Matron.

49:34.121 --> 49:36.410
- Where's Sally?
- She got worse.

49:37.146 --> 49:39.306
They took her to the isolation ward.

49:44.309 --> 49:46.589
That door won't keep them in for long.

49:47.299 --> 49:48.926
- Open the door right now!

49:50.206 --> 49:54.166
Here, have some chocolates to keep
you going before help arrives!

49:54.449 --> 49:56.387
- Oh..., chocolates.

49:56.830 --> 49:58.856
- Oh, no!
We shouldn't eat these!

49:58.947 --> 50:01.167
- Why not?
They're so very, very

50:01.642 --> 50:02.842
tasty.

50:04.027 --> 50:05.986
- That will see them through
to the morning.

50:06.090 --> 50:08.250
What are we going to do about Sally?

50:09.782 --> 50:11.702
I've let her down so many times.

50:13.271 --> 50:14.771
Can't let her down again.

50:14.859 --> 50:16.359
You mustn't give in, hmm?

50:18.926 --> 50:21.690
She wants a big, beautiful life.

50:25.430 --> 50:28.361
The Midnight Gang
is going to give it to her.

50:31.432 --> 50:32.632
Yeah.

50:36.352 --> 50:37.992
Robin..., stand up!

50:54.246 --> 50:55.446
OK, ready?

50:55.586 --> 50:57.092
You go find Sally, hey?

51:19.242 --> 51:20.768
- You took your time.

51:22.846 --> 51:24.826
Are you sure you want to do this?

51:25.021 --> 51:26.221
It's now...

51:26.399 --> 51:27.599
or never.

51:55.556 --> 51:56.756
Sally,

51:56.910 --> 51:58.439
welcome at last

51:58.647 --> 52:01.167
to The Midnight Gang's
presentation of...

52:01.455 --> 52:02.655
your big,

52:02.680 --> 52:04.063
beautiful, life.

54:43.285 --> 54:45.357
And last but not least...

54:52.071 --> 54:54.597
I loved it, I loved it,
I loved it!

54:54.970 --> 54:56.170
Huh...

54:59.852 --> 55:01.052
We're...

55:01.176 --> 55:02.376
done for.

55:11.148 --> 55:13.581
Beautiful, beautiful!

55:14.501 --> 55:16.964
Absolutely beautiful!

55:17.087 --> 55:19.127
You wonderful, wonderful children!

55:19.495 --> 55:21.417
Here, have a duster.

55:23.429 --> 55:26.136
- Pure genius.
- It was mainly my idea.

55:26.182 --> 55:29.027
Do you know what the most
moving part was?

55:29.144 --> 55:32.744
- Oh, um..., me being on the old
projector here? - No.

55:33.269 --> 55:35.849
Seeing this special
little patient of ours

55:35.983 --> 55:38.535
do something we've not
seen her do before...

55:38.536 --> 55:39.736
smiling.

55:41.130 --> 55:44.970
Everyone here at the hospital works
so hard to help young Suzy.

55:44.989 --> 55:46.789
- It's Sally.
- Are you sure?

55:47.341 --> 55:51.644
- Fairly. - But none of us thought
to simply make her smile.

55:52.785 --> 55:53.985
Sally...

55:55.160 --> 55:57.500
it's going to be a really long journey.

55:58.069 --> 56:02.089
But I want you to be able to do
all those things for real one day.

56:02.289 --> 56:03.489
And I promise you,

56:04.599 --> 56:06.099
I will never stop trying.

56:07.062 --> 56:08.262
Thank you.

56:08.478 --> 56:09.678
- Sir Quentin...

56:09.799 --> 56:12.995
we couldn't have done
any of this without the Porter.

56:12.996 --> 56:15.336
The kindest person I've ever met and...

56:16.349 --> 56:19.529
the man you sacked.
- Well, I may have been hasty,

56:19.815 --> 56:21.015
but I'm sorry,

56:21.040 --> 56:23.402
you're not,
getting your job back.

56:24.839 --> 56:26.039
- Oh.
- No.

56:26.827 --> 56:29.253
I'm promoting you!

56:31.072 --> 56:32.272
What?

56:32.596 --> 56:35.706
Yes, our very first Doctor of Fun!

56:38.228 --> 56:39.831
Oh, thank you.

56:40.375 --> 56:43.855
- But I hear you live in a basement
and we can't have that.

56:44.283 --> 56:47.871
Come and live with me and I will
bring you breakfast every morning

56:47.872 --> 56:49.072
in bed.
- Well,

56:49.631 --> 56:51.189
that's an offer.
- Now, then,

56:51.190 --> 56:54.070
I think it's high time
we left young Sally here

56:54.212 --> 56:55.933
to get some rest.
- No,

56:56.007 --> 56:57.917
please, can I just have
one more night

56:57.918 --> 56:59.522
back in the ward
with The Midnight Gang?

56:59.523 --> 57:02.823
- I'm not sure that that... - Please!
- Please, please, please, please.

57:02.848 --> 57:04.516
- All right. All right!
All right!

57:05.470 --> 57:07.136
Just one night, mind.

57:07.388 --> 57:08.588
Yes!

57:08.878 --> 57:10.078
- Thank you.

57:40.177 --> 57:42.757
- Thank you so much
for giving me your wish.

57:43.531 --> 57:44.731
You deserve it.

57:45.956 --> 57:47.156
What would yours be?

57:47.503 --> 57:49.517
Oh, I have two,
and...

57:49.943 --> 57:51.143
one's come true.

57:52.596 --> 57:54.276
It was to make some friends.

57:55.520 --> 57:56.720
You big softie.

57:57.854 --> 57:59.234
What was the other one?

58:02.320 --> 58:03.657
To see Mum and Dad.

58:07.081 --> 58:08.281
Well,

58:09.019 --> 58:10.618
dreams can come true.

58:12.167 --> 58:14.267
The Midnight Gang's taught us that.

58:15.593 --> 58:18.681
It's been the most amazing night.

58:19.840 --> 58:22.876
I've had the adventure of a lifetime.

58:36.892 --> 58:39.173
- La-la-la!

58:39.551 --> 58:42.103
Good morning
and good morning

58:42.128 --> 58:43.517
and good morning!

58:43.820 --> 58:45.020
Breakfast time!

58:45.298 --> 58:48.060
Who wants cornflake box and water?

58:48.324 --> 58:49.982
So...,

58:50.326 --> 58:52.287
how's my favourite patient?

58:52.524 --> 58:55.344
- Better, thanks.
- Good morning, Sir Quentin,

58:55.347 --> 58:57.412
can I interest you in a sock

58:57.622 --> 58:58.882
on some cardboard...?

59:00.693 --> 59:02.030
- What's that noise?

59:02.055 --> 59:05.115
- Don't hear no noise.
- How can you not hear it?!

59:05.344 --> 59:06.544
- Let us out!

59:06.741 --> 59:07.941
Let us out, now!

59:13.406 --> 59:14.606
Arrest that man!

59:15.231 --> 59:18.351
He locked us in there all night,
have him put down!

59:18.542 --> 59:22.313
Is this true? I may have to
reconsider my reconsideration.

59:26.850 --> 59:28.719
I hope this explains...

59:29.341 --> 59:31.919
"I open all the letters
the boys receive,"

59:31.944 --> 59:35.297
"I steal the book tokens
and then burn the rest!"

59:35.480 --> 59:38.822
- "My local church gives my ward
toys for the children,"

59:38.847 --> 59:42.586
"I sell the toys and I spend
all the money on shoes!"

59:45.685 --> 59:49.257
- I was doing those spoilt children
a favour by stealing their presents!

59:49.258 --> 59:53.278
- My shoes, what will happen to my
perfectly normal number of shoes?

59:53.834 --> 59:55.399
Don't be strangers!

59:55.951 --> 59:58.312
- Losers! - Losers!

01:00:06.577 --> 01:00:07.777
Tom,

01:00:08.097 --> 01:00:10.197
Sally had a chat with me yesterday,

01:00:10.734 --> 01:00:13.100
and I made some calls
and, well,

01:00:14.602 --> 01:00:16.822
there's some people here
to see you.

01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:27.512
Mum!

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:29.574
Dad!

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:46.489
So,

01:00:46.617 --> 01:00:48.237
what's on the menu for this

01:00:48.731 --> 01:00:49.931
breakfast in bed?

01:00:50.315 --> 01:00:51.515
Everything.

01:00:51.676 --> 01:00:52.876
And I mean,

01:00:52.966 --> 01:00:54.166
everything.

01:00:54.911 --> 01:00:56.111
Oh, goodness!

01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:02.186
I've come to say goodbye.

01:01:03.511 --> 01:01:04.711
Bye, New Boy.

01:01:04.966 --> 01:01:07.186
All of us have to move on in the end.

01:01:07.593 --> 01:01:10.441
I'll have these casts off
on Wednesday and then

01:01:10.442 --> 01:01:11.869
I'll be out of here too.

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:13.790
I get my stitches out next week.

01:01:14.793 --> 01:01:19.293
And then I'll be gone. - My bandage
is coming off at the end of the month.

01:01:19.306 --> 01:01:21.166
Then that'll be the last of us.

01:01:22.976 --> 01:01:25.616
Maybe this is the end
of The Midnight Gang.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.160
Never.

01:01:30.301 --> 01:01:32.281
The gang just needs a new leader.

01:01:33.609 --> 01:01:34.809
Sally?

01:01:35.765 --> 01:01:37.374
- Me?
- Yes.

01:01:37.786 --> 01:01:39.890
You will make sure all the new patients

01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:41.571
have their wishes come true.

01:01:41.596 --> 01:01:43.053
I would love to!

01:01:43.994 --> 01:01:46.866
But, will you help me?
- You bet I will!

01:01:48.399 --> 01:01:51.325
- Just...  don't get The Midnight
Gang in any more trouble.

01:01:51.326 --> 01:01:52.526
Of course.

01:01:52.678 --> 01:01:54.718
Well, maybe little bit of trouble.

01:02:00.704 --> 01:02:02.585
- Yippee!

01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:05.623
Nelly!

01:02:35.997 --> 01:02:37.197
The End
