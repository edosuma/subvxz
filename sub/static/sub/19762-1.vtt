<i>You've reached the bellows.</i>

01:08.402 --> 01:09.835
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:10.704 --> 01:13.238
Hey, um, you weren't there
to meet me at the station,

01:13.240 --> 01:17.709
so I'm, I'm just walking home so
I hope you're not on your way,

01:17.711 --> 01:19.178
'cause I'm nearly there.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.180
Um.
Well, I'm looking forward

01:21.182 --> 01:25.284
to seeing you all;
I hope everything's okay.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.486
Alright, um...

03:42.822 --> 03:44.990
Are you coming over?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.863
<i>Wha-what's wrong?</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:56.268
<i>Dude, what's
the matter with you?</i>

03:59.339 --> 04:00.505
<i>The fuck you doing?</i>

04:00.507 --> 04:04.710
<i>You wanna fucking go?
Fucking fuck you up.</i>

04:20.726 --> 04:22.294
<i>Nick?</i>

04:22.296 --> 04:24.029
<i>Yeah, mum, it's me.</i>

04:24.031 --> 04:26.999
<i>How's my boy?</i>

04:27.001 --> 04:30.402
Yeah, I'm fine, mum,
how are you?

04:30.404 --> 04:32.437
<i>Fine.</i>

04:32.439 --> 04:35.407
<i>Did you go to mass, son?</i>

04:35.409 --> 04:37.476
Yeah, uh-huh.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.811
<i>Good, good.</i>

04:40.947 --> 04:43.849
<i>Was a beautiful day
here actually.</i>

04:43.851 --> 04:46.318
<i>How was the weather there?</i>

04:46.320 --> 04:47.519
Um, yeah, yeah.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.657
It's a beautiful day, yeah.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.428
<i>Strange, isn't it?</i>

04:56.430 --> 04:58.964
<i>That today should
be so beautiful?</i>

04:58.966 --> 05:02.668
Yeah.
It is.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.569
Yeah, it is.

05:07.073 --> 05:11.810
<i>You have one
minute left on your call.</i>

05:15.548 --> 05:17.616
Mum, maybe I better go.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.051
<i>Already?</i>

05:19.053 --> 05:21.653
Yeah, well, this phone
card is running out,

05:21.655 --> 05:27.726
and time seems to be taking
its toll ay-de-ay-de.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.861
<i>It's lovely to hear from you.</i>

05:29.863 --> 05:31.697
Yeah.

05:33.766 --> 05:37.903
I'm really sorry I couldn't
be there today, mum.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.844
Mum?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.725
Hey, man.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.660
Oh, hello to you, too.

06:01.662 --> 06:05.664
You, you alright, man, you,
you were late again.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.833
Sorry, Sam.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.868
I'm sorry, it's fine,
I don't really care.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.071
I probably care about this
job as much as you do so.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.007
But just, uh, you know,
try to show up on time.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.843
I don't wanna have to fire you.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.411
Ah, can you go clear some tables

06:19.413 --> 06:22.714
or, ah, you know, take
someone's order, anything?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.716
Please, thanks.

06:49.041 --> 06:53.145
Um, don't look over there, but
there's a guy who looks...

06:53.147 --> 06:56.148
Don't look over there!

06:57.016 --> 06:59.551
Don't look over there.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.455
Oh, uh, table 7.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.756
Table 7.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.825
Table 7 perhaps?

07:09.629 --> 07:12.197
You want something?

07:14.167 --> 07:16.468
You don't remember me, do you?

07:16.470 --> 07:19.004
Of course I remember you.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.039
Stare much?

07:21.041 --> 07:21.907
Huh?

07:21.909 --> 07:23.608
Stare much?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.877
Are you serious?

07:26.078 --> 07:27.746
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.148
Whoa guys, settle
down, settle down.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.216
He started it.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.019
Hello, that guy started
it, we saw, we saw it.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.455
Yeah, he totally did.
He totally started it.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.224
<i>- He was being a dick.
- Huge dick.</i>

07:39.226 --> 07:41.660
Yeah.
Enormous, enormous dick.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.662
Huge dick.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.230
<i>He was, get him out of here.</i>

07:45.232 --> 07:46.698
I've already had you once, mate.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.067
- Hey, come on.
<i>- Kick him out.</i>

07:49.069 --> 07:50.068
Get him out.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.905
Kick him out, right outta
here, get him outta here.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.640
<i>- Out.
- Out.</i>

07:55.642 --> 07:58.877
<i>I want him outta here,
we want him outta here.</i>

08:00.880 --> 08:02.714
<i>Hey.</i>

08:06.018 --> 08:07.552
What's your name?

08:07.554 --> 08:09.054
Her name's sue.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.789
You can't speak for yourself?

08:10.791 --> 08:13.158
No, she can't.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.929
Wow, you're a serious wacko.

08:18.764 --> 08:19.965
Come on, em.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.032
I mean sue.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.568
I'm, I'll be right there.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.169
Ya sure?

08:24.171 --> 08:27.005
I'm watching you, wacko.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.177
So how'd that go for you?

08:32.179 --> 08:36.748
Yeah, it was good, I got fired.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.649
- Great.
- Yeah.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.750
I've got another job so...

08:38.751 --> 08:42.254
Well, hopefully you don't
kill anyone there.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.756
I can't promise.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.793
Where do I know you from?

08:48.961 --> 08:52.063
I saw you at the club
the other night.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.598
That's not it.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.200
This is our favorite restaurant.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.035
You probably just saw
me here before...

08:57.037 --> 09:00.005
No, that's not it either.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.044
Where's your girlfriend?

09:07.647 --> 09:08.146
What?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.181
Your girlfriend, the one
you were dancing with.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.317
Oh, she's not my girlfriend.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.253
- Does she know that?
- Yeah.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.890
What about you,
you got a boyfriend?

09:31.037 --> 09:34.606
I should probably go.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.308
Okay.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.643
Nice to meet ya.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.251
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

10:24.256 --> 10:28.960
Pretty girls make you wait
though, that's all I'm saying.

10:29.261 --> 10:33.298
Maybe we should call
them or, I don't know.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.401
Nah.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.040
Give me your phone.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.157
Oh, hi, you alright?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.925
Yeah.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.361
Um...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.737
I'm sorry, it's Anna, right?

11:12.739 --> 11:13.838
Yeah.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.142
- Sammy.
- I know.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.820
What happened to your hand?

11:31.123 --> 11:34.959
Nothing of particular import.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.030
You won't tell me?

11:42.134 --> 11:46.971
You're not from around
here, are you?

11:48.207 --> 11:51.142
No, I'm not from around here.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.379
So why'd you come here?

11:55.114 --> 11:57.348
Work?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.184
School?

12:01.854 --> 12:05.957
I heard you girls had really
good oral hygiene.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.894
- We do.
- Yeah?

12:09.896 --> 12:12.330
Go on, show me then.

12:57.810 --> 13:00.879
So, is this just what you do?

13:00.881 --> 13:02.280
What?

13:02.282 --> 13:05.550
Go from girl to girl to girl.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.554
No, it's not what I do.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.857
So you wanna come home with me?

13:49.461 --> 13:52.163
<i>Get a fucking room.</i>

13:55.501 --> 13:57.368
Whoa, Nick.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.237
Hey, whoa.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.605
Hey!

14:00.607 --> 14:02.040
Nick?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.142
Wrong eyes.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.180
Scary.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.082
Am I?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.040
Oh, no.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.644
Uh, I really hurt
myself that time.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.445
Ugh.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.981
No, I'm joking.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.083
Good though, right?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.252
It's funny?

14:54.360 --> 14:57.195
What time are you
getting off work?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.130
Soon. Why?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.498
I was coming to rescue you.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.968
Oh, I don't need rescuing.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.149
<i>Guys, this is Nickie.</i>

15:18.151 --> 15:21.286
I don't want this sword,
swap me.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.086
Okay.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.622
Up against the wall.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.129
Go time!

15:31.131 --> 15:33.464
Ahhh!

15:33.466 --> 15:34.966
Oh, I'm saving you.

15:34.968 --> 15:35.400
Bang.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.670
I've got her, I've got
her, I've got her.

15:38.672 --> 15:44.575
No, no, no, ah, no.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.711
Ah.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.103
- Sammy.
- How's it going?

16:12.105 --> 16:14.238
<i>- Hi, how are ya?
- Good.</i>

16:14.240 --> 16:16.007
<i>Hey, Nick, where's your friend?</i>

16:16.009 --> 16:20.478
Well, we didn't know you guys
were coming, so she's not here.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.181
Sorry. You're adorable,
you know that?

16:23.183 --> 16:25.350
Yeah, tell that to your friend.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.051
She gave me her number,

16:27.053 --> 16:28.386
and we were texting last night,

16:28.388 --> 16:32.523
and then, I told her
that she dazzled me,

16:32.525 --> 16:35.059
<i>and sent her that,
like, the three stars,</i>

16:35.061 --> 16:37.528
<i>and the, like, the, you know,
the whooshy symbol thing.</i>

16:37.530 --> 16:39.731
She likes you, she likes you,
man, you just need to text her

16:39.733 --> 16:41.532
and tell her that
you think she's great,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.401
and just be really direct.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.103
She doesn't like guys
who are, like, you know,

16:45.105 --> 16:47.705
<i>so just make a decision.
He has to be patient, right?</i>

16:47.707 --> 16:49.073
<i>Nickie?</i>

16:49.075 --> 16:51.676
What, what, wha...
Why are you being weird?

16:51.678 --> 16:54.679
I'm not being weird.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.248
Okay.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.616
Are you okay?

16:58.618 --> 17:01.119
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.188
<i>Hey, Emily!</i>

17:06.025 --> 17:09.527
Just two seconds, two seconds.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.329
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.665
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

17:14.666 --> 17:17.167
I'm good. Good.
Where have you been?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.803
Here and there, everywhere.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.173
What does that even mean,
here, there, everywhere?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.273
I've just been busy.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.675
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sorry.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.144
So what's been up?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.445
I've been trying to reach
you and stuff like that.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.381
Yeah, I mean, I don't really
have a phone right now,

17:30.383 --> 17:33.184
<i>I'm kind of going on
without a phone...</i>

17:33.186 --> 17:33.618
Yeah.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.487
So I don't really have, I'm
trying this no-phone thing so.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.289
But yeah, but I'll see you...

17:38.291 --> 17:40.191
No, no, no, please just
stop walking around,

17:40.193 --> 17:43.394
and walking everywhere
like that, just...

17:59.144 --> 18:02.680
- I'm not a violent person, I swear.
- Okay.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.315
- No, ah, Emily, I'm not.
- I believe you.

18:04.317 --> 18:07.819
- I know what you must think of me, I know.
- I believe you.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.620
But I'm not, okay, I'm not.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.721
Why did you do that then?

18:10.723 --> 18:14.625
I don't know, I didn't even
think to do it, I just, I just,

18:14.627 --> 18:18.329
it's not something
I even thought about.

18:24.736 --> 18:29.240
It's a bit of a hard
time of year for me.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.342
What does that mean?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.478
Nothing.

18:34.246 --> 18:35.813
Why won't you tell me?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.816
I don't think I can do this.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.788
Okay.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.591
Is that what you want?

18:52.764 --> 18:54.699
Okay.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.537
I'm confused, Nick.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.840
I'm just not really
used to this.

19:03.609 --> 19:07.178
I'm not really
good at it, you know?

19:07.180 --> 19:08.246
Mm-hm.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.915
Em, I had a really nice
time with you today.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.750
I had a really good day.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.584
It was really fun.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.752
I know I shouldn't have...

19:14.754 --> 19:16.220
Em, you didn't do anything.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.523
I got ex...
I got nervous.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.759
Emily, it was my fault.

20:59.858 --> 21:02.526
<i>Are we gonna
continue to see each other?</i>

21:02.528 --> 21:03.527
Mm-hm.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.864
Can we not see anybody else?

21:06.866 --> 21:09.333
If you were seeing
someone else right now,

21:09.335 --> 21:11.669
I'd throw her into a volcano.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.338
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:27.319 --> 21:30.788
My dad won't be home until late.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.817
Em.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.678
You're beautiful.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.915
You're so, so beautiful.

22:33.652 --> 22:36.554
You're so very beautiful.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.788
Shh.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.958
Em, em please.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.560
Beautiful man.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.694
Shut up.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.664
You are beautiful.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.805
What is this, Nick?

22:56.742 --> 22:58.876
This right here?

23:03.081 --> 23:04.648
Hmm?

23:04.650 --> 23:07.518
What is it, Nick?

23:10.789 --> 23:12.890
It's a date.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.495
What date?

23:24.569 --> 23:26.771
What date?

23:30.609 --> 23:35.579
Em, my brother disappeared
5 years ago.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.015
My little brother.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.754
On the way to school one day.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.065
And that's the date,

23:55.067 --> 23:58.903
that's the date that
it happened.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.563
You have to meet my dad.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.065
My dad would love you, Nick.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.001
I wanna show you
a painting, Nick.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.239
I have to show you
a painting, Nick.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.675
<i>I have to show you a painting.</i>

25:24.756 --> 25:27.191
Will you marry me?

25:27.193 --> 25:29.727
Sure, I'll marry you.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.530
Okay, what if I'm serious, Nick?

25:32.532 --> 25:33.564
Ahh!

25:33.566 --> 25:35.299
<i>Don't you think we
should wait a little bit?</i>

25:35.301 --> 25:38.235
<i>Why?
Nick, why?</i>

25:38.237 --> 25:40.037
<i>Because that's what people do.</i>

25:40.039 --> 25:42.239
<i>What do we care what people do?</i>

25:42.241 --> 25:45.075
- We don't.
- No.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.278
Serious?

25:47.280 --> 25:48.979
You serious?

25:48.981 --> 25:50.681
Yes.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.719
No. No.

25:55.721 --> 26:01.926
I know, I'm sorry,
Princess nut bucket, I know.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.108
You can go if you want to.

26:22.047 --> 26:25.950
Why would I want to
go, I don't wanna go.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.652
<i>Good.</i>

26:44.336 --> 26:46.870
What's going on?

26:49.174 --> 26:49.773
Nothing.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.977
Just get the jitters
sometimes, that's all.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.713
But they're gone now, it's okay.

26:55.715 --> 27:00.818
Why do you get
the jitters sometimes?

27:07.025 --> 27:10.661
Why do you get
the jitters sometimes?

27:15.834 --> 27:19.803
'Cause I'm
rapid cycling bipolar 1.

27:20.905 --> 27:23.407
I'm rcbp1.

27:24.976 --> 27:29.246
I'm like a poorly
assembled robot.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.726
I think you're wonderful.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.299
And I adore you, em.

28:56.801 --> 28:59.803
<i>Where you
calling me from this time?</i>

28:59.805 --> 29:03.207
I'm actually calling you
from my apartment.

29:03.209 --> 29:06.777
<i>Well, settling down, son?</i>

29:06.779 --> 29:10.347
Sure, mum, whatever you say.

29:10.849 --> 29:14.518
<i>And to what do I owe
the pleasure?</i>

29:14.520 --> 29:16.420
Uh.

29:18.456 --> 29:19.289
<i>Hm?</i>

29:19.291 --> 29:22.392
Kinda seeing someone, I suppose.

29:25.029 --> 29:26.964
<i>Is it serious?</i>

29:26.966 --> 29:33.237
Um, ah, yeah, kinda, yeah.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.372
<i>Nice girl, I hope?</i>

29:35.374 --> 29:37.141
Oh, no, she's horrible,
she's a hag,

29:37.143 --> 29:40.077
deals drugs, missing teeth,

29:40.079 --> 29:42.079
no nose, she hasn't got
a nose, mum.

29:42.081 --> 29:48.852
Yes, mum, she's, um,
I think she's lovely.

29:49.988 --> 29:53.056
<i>Well, it's getting late.</i>

29:53.058 --> 29:53.924
Okay.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.526
<i>Quick chat with your father.</i>

29:55.528 --> 29:57.961
<i>William?</i>

29:59.030 --> 30:02.166
<i>Hey, Nick, you doing alright?</i>

30:02.168 --> 30:06.069
Hey, dad.
Mm-hm. You?

30:06.071 --> 30:06.970
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:06.972 --> 30:09.006
Hey, listen, dad,
I'm really sorry

30:09.008 --> 30:10.974
I didn't make it back this year.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.877
<i>Yeah, that's okay, Nick.</i>

30:13.879 --> 30:18.048
<i>There's no need to come back
all this way just for one day.</i>

30:18.050 --> 30:24.354
<i>Um, it's an early day
for me tomorrow.</i>

30:24.856 --> 30:27.124
<i>It was nice speaking with you.</i>

30:27.126 --> 30:30.227
Very nice speaking with you too.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.000
<i>Emily.</i>

31:21.312 --> 31:22.279
Emily.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.447
Ohh, oh, oh.

31:23.449 --> 31:24.147
<i>Whoa!</i>

31:24.149 --> 31:28.252
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

31:28.254 --> 31:28.652
Hey.

31:28.654 --> 31:32.623
What are you doing,
what's going on?

31:32.625 --> 31:33.657
Getting it done.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.425
- <i>Sure looks it.</i>
- Yeah.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.127
<i>Hello?</i>

31:37.129 --> 31:38.362
We're in here.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.197
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yeah.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.331
<i>Coming.
Hi.</i>

31:41.333 --> 31:43.934
- Hey.
- How are you?

31:43.936 --> 31:47.604
I'm okay, mm-hm,
how are you?

31:47.606 --> 31:50.440
Hey, how are you, sweetie?

31:50.442 --> 31:52.342
You've been painting,
oh, my gosh.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.011
Don't you touch me, what's that?

31:54.013 --> 31:57.414
Oh, you look lovely, but you
have a lot of paint on you.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.616
- I know.
- What happened, what happened?

31:59.618 --> 32:01.618
- I threw up paint.
- Why?

32:01.620 --> 32:04.154
Ah, 'cause I ate too much.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.056
Hello?

32:06.058 --> 32:07.090
Yes.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.193
Hi, mm-hm.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.562
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- I'll be right back.

32:12.564 --> 32:16.266
<i>I haven't forgotten, come over.</i>

32:16.268 --> 32:18.101
<i>Of course, come over,</i>

32:18.103 --> 32:25.642
come over now, come over now,
okay bye, bye, bye, buh buh bye.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.278
Em, how ya feeling?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.313
<i>I feel great actually.</i>

32:29.315 --> 32:33.016
<i>Right now, I feel so fine,
I feel actually...</i>

32:33.018 --> 32:35.319
What?
I feel fine.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.687
I feel really good right now.

32:36.689 --> 32:38.622
<i>So I don't wanna do
that right now,</i>

32:38.624 --> 32:40.524
<i>I don't wanna talk about
that right now.</i>

32:40.526 --> 32:43.226
<i>I get that, but you
need to, uh, sit down,</i>

32:43.228 --> 32:44.661
<i>and you need to take your meds.</i>

32:44.663 --> 32:46.296
I don't wanna sit down
right now, dad.

32:46.298 --> 32:50.367
Look at what I'm in the process
of doing, and I have to go.

32:50.369 --> 32:53.070
<i>Em, you can't go out
the way you are.</i>

32:53.072 --> 32:53.637
<i>Why not?</i>

32:53.639 --> 32:55.405
Well, because you have
paint all over your dress,

32:55.407 --> 32:57.507
so why don't we get
yourself cleaned up first.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.343
Ugh, I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.411
Sorry, I don't have time
for this right now.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.246
Where's my purse?

33:22.033 --> 33:24.668
It's okay, just...

33:26.237 --> 33:31.475
We're all cool, hmm, right?

33:33.778 --> 33:36.613
Emily, can we be honest?

33:36.615 --> 33:38.482
<i>I-I would love that.</i>

33:38.484 --> 33:43.120
You are so up right now!

33:46.658 --> 33:50.060
Wake up, wake up, dad!

33:50.261 --> 33:53.196
You're taking these, Emily.

33:53.198 --> 33:57.401
You're taking these, and I'm
giving you this, alright?

33:58.604 --> 34:00.237
Keep it easy for us.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.439
I-I'm making
it easy.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.673
You stay right here.

34:03.675 --> 34:06.343
Get her some water, please.

34:08.612 --> 34:10.246
<i>Good evening.</i>

34:10.248 --> 34:11.181
Can I help you?

34:11.183 --> 34:16.152
<i>We received a call about some
loud music at this address.</i>

34:16.155 --> 34:18.355
Well, you don't hear any
loud music, do you?

34:18.357 --> 34:22.391
<i>No, probably the wrong
house, I would guess.</i>

34:22.393 --> 34:24.127
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:24.129 --> 34:25.594
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

34:25.597 --> 34:27.130
<i>Yeah, everything's fine.</i>

34:27.132 --> 34:29.199
Who's that?
What? Who broke...?

34:29.201 --> 34:30.300
Why did you call the cop?

34:30.302 --> 34:33.203
- We didn't call the cop.
- You did. I can see him.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.504
We did not call the cops.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.273
I see you.
Come on in, yeah!

34:36.275 --> 34:37.741
Come in. No, it's fine,
it's good.

34:37.743 --> 34:41.478
You know why, because my parents are
illicit pharmaceutical pushers.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.379
Would you please...?

34:42.380 --> 34:47.184
You're trying to poison
me, maybe he'll help me.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.452
<i>Is everything okay here?</i>

34:48.454 --> 34:50.120
Can I talk to you in
the kitchen, please?

34:50.121 --> 34:52.322
Can I just talk to you for
a couple minutes in the kitchen?

34:52.324 --> 34:54.224
You know what, you can go,
you can get out of here.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.525
<i>Sir, please step
aside, thank you.</i>

34:55.527 --> 34:57.594
It's alright. Dad.
I'm done with you.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.495
I'm done. Go away.

34:58.497 --> 35:01.098
Emily, if you don't calm down,
I can't help you, sweetheart.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.599
I'm calm look at me,
I'm so calm right now,

35:02.601 --> 35:04.634
I'm not even up there.
I'm like way down here.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.771
<i>You have no idea what I'm capable of!
Do you understand?</i>

35:07.773 --> 35:11.508
- Do not touch me.
- I'll touch you with my goddamn eyeballs.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.144
- <i>Emily.</i>
- You are not real!

35:14.146 --> 35:15.479
I asked you to leave now.

35:15.481 --> 35:16.780
<i>You asked me to come inside.</i>

35:16.782 --> 35:20.817
You're under my bidding because you
know what, I said I talked to god.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.552
- No problem.
- I talk to god.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.287
You worship him.
You do, yeah!

35:24.289 --> 35:26.323
<i>I'm gonna call ambulance, okay.</i>

35:26.325 --> 35:28.291
<i>You don't need to
call an ambulance.</i>

35:28.293 --> 35:30.594
That's it.
I think he should.

35:30.596 --> 35:33.563
I think he should.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.533
Dad, dad, dad!

35:36.535 --> 35:37.834
Do not touch me.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.237
You're exciting her!

35:40.239 --> 35:42.405
<i>Sir! Sir! Sir!
Just chill!</i>

35:42.407 --> 35:46.209
<i>Get your hands off my daughter.</i>

35:48.447 --> 35:51.214
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

35:51.216 --> 35:56.553
Calm down, calm down.
Calm down, calm down.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.489
- <i>Hey, sweetie.</i>
- Relax.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.791
Stop moving and we're
gonna let you go, okay?

36:01.793 --> 36:04.427
- I'm not moving.
- Can we make that deal?

36:04.429 --> 36:06.229
- Yes, deal.
- Alright. Deal.

36:06.231 --> 36:08.365
<i>Stop moving and
we'll let you go.</i>

36:08.367 --> 36:10.367
I'm moving.

36:10.369 --> 36:14.538
<i>I'm late, you goddamn fucking
dick sucker cunts!</i>

36:14.540 --> 36:16.373
<i>Would you like me to...</i>

36:16.375 --> 36:17.607
<i>I'm fucking late!</i>

36:17.609 --> 36:19.342
You're gonna really
like him, Marie.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.344
- I know.
- I swear to god.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.612
I swear to god, because,
you know what,

36:22.614 --> 36:27.918
the thing is Nickie and I,
me and him are the same ones.

36:27.920 --> 36:31.254
You know?
We just, we just are.

36:31.256 --> 36:32.522
- I know.
- We just are, you know?

36:32.524 --> 36:38.495
And I need him.
Why? Why isn't he here?

36:38.497 --> 36:39.829
No!

36:39.831 --> 36:42.465
Where is he?

36:42.867 --> 36:45.502
I can hear him,
I know he's there.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.838
You're not letting me see him.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.475
I don't wanna stay here.

36:52.477 --> 36:56.980
I wanna see him!

37:45.930 --> 37:48.765
<i>I'm Nickie, and I saw
what happened.</i>

37:48.767 --> 37:50.800
<i>Can I see Emily?</i>

37:50.802 --> 37:56.273
Uh, listen, Nickie,
Emily's resting.

37:57.341 --> 37:59.309
Whoa.

38:00.044 --> 38:04.481
Yes? When do I get
to see Emily?

38:04.483 --> 38:07.951
Emily is resting.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.487
Good night.

38:14.825 --> 38:16.893
<i>Oh, for god...</i>

38:17.595 --> 38:20.697
Just give me one
minute, alright?

38:22.566 --> 38:26.002
<i>Were we supposed
to meet tonight?</i>

38:26.871 --> 38:32.375
My memory isn't
what it could be.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.378
Yeah, we were, yeah.

38:37.948 --> 38:43.019
Okay.
I thought so, sorry.

38:46.557 --> 38:50.760
Emily, take off your
sunglasses, please.

38:51.729 --> 38:55.065
I just wanna see your face.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.034
Hey.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.426
I have to go in now.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.763
Okay.

39:28.799 --> 39:32.402
<i>When am I gonna
hear from you, em?</i>

39:34.739 --> 39:37.674
<i>I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

39:39.944 --> 39:40.810
Really?

39:40.812 --> 39:42.746
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

39:42.748 --> 39:45.081
<i>Thanks.</i>

39:45.083 --> 39:48.385
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

40:09.673 --> 40:12.442
<i>Hi, you've reached Emily.</i>

40:13.945 --> 40:18.948
Hey, uh, how you doing?

40:19.884 --> 40:21.418
Umm...

40:21.552 --> 40:25.088
I just wanna know
how you're feeling.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.167
<i>Hi, you've reached Emily.</i>

40:39.070 --> 40:45.708
<i>Hi, uh, look, I really
don't wanna bother you.</i>

40:45.710 --> 40:47.811
<i>Um...</i>

40:48.145 --> 40:49.913
<i>No, I'm just...</i>

40:49.915 --> 40:55.151
<i>I just wanna know that you're
doing okay, and...</i>

40:58.756 --> 41:02.692
<i>Yeah, alright.</i>

41:03.060 --> 41:07.163
<i>Well, I'll speak to you
soon hopefully.</i>

41:35.226 --> 41:37.527
<i>Hi, you've reached Emily.</i>

43:04.281 --> 43:10.286
<i>And then, without
even realizing where I was,</i>

43:10.288 --> 43:14.991
<i>suddenly I was driving
by the old house.</i>

43:14.993 --> 43:18.094
<i>So I stopped.</i>

43:18.796 --> 43:22.632
<i>It looks exactly
the same from the outside.</i>

43:22.634 --> 43:26.769
<i>But it isn't
the same now, is it?</i>

43:28.773 --> 43:34.711
<i>Strangers living there now,
some strange boy</i>

43:34.713 --> 43:39.215
<i>or girl sleeps in
your brother's bed now.</i>

43:39.217 --> 43:43.953
<i>It's a strange thing,
isn't it, Nick?</i>

43:43.955 --> 43:46.122
Yeah, it is.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.159
<i>I'm sorry, son.</i>

43:50.161 --> 43:54.163
Mum, you do not have
to apologize to me.

43:56.033 --> 44:00.670
<i>So did you think about
it some more?</i>

44:03.374 --> 44:05.375
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:05.377 --> 44:06.242
<i>And?</i>

44:06.244 --> 44:10.279
<i>I'm not gonna be able
to make it home, mum.</i>

44:14.885 --> 44:18.254
<i>Because you're still
seeing that girl?</i>

44:18.256 --> 44:20.289
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

44:21.825 --> 44:23.760
<i>Okay.</i>

44:23.762 --> 44:24.661
I should go, mum.

44:24.663 --> 44:28.398
<i>Fine, but if you don't
take care of yourself</i>

44:28.400 --> 44:30.733
<i>I'll come fetch you.</i>

44:30.735 --> 44:35.104
Mum, you do not have to
worry about me, okay?

44:44.715 --> 44:46.716
Hi.

44:53.223 --> 44:55.892
- Come in.
- Okay.

45:00.998 --> 45:03.232
Where you been hiding?

45:08.038 --> 45:10.773
Here, just here.

45:12.276 --> 45:17.146
Well, I'm glad you allowed me
into your secret hiding spot.

45:26.423 --> 45:28.324
Hey.

45:38.102 --> 45:41.771
<i>Nick, you can talk to me, okay?</i>

45:43.507 --> 45:49.112
<i>I mean, what do you want
me to do, should I go?</i>

45:51.849 --> 45:53.916
Okay.

46:00.290 --> 46:02.024
<i>Wow.</i>

47:52.236 --> 47:54.203
Hey.

47:56.173 --> 47:57.139
Nice to see you.

47:57.141 --> 47:59.108
- Hey, John, you alright?
- Yeah.

47:59.110 --> 48:01.611
Hey, man, how's it going?

48:01.613 --> 48:03.880
Good to see ya!

48:06.183 --> 48:07.416
Whoo!

48:09.988 --> 48:11.554
Yeah, three more.

48:11.556 --> 48:14.257
Here we go!

48:14.259 --> 48:17.093
Yo, can we have three
more, come on, man.

48:17.095 --> 48:19.362
You don't have to be a dick.

48:20.965 --> 48:24.300
<i>Might as well have some
fun tonight, yeah?</i>

48:24.302 --> 48:26.035
There we go!
Ya alright?

48:26.037 --> 48:27.436
<i>Have a little bit of fun!?</i>

48:27.438 --> 48:28.204
A little bit.

48:28.206 --> 48:30.339
I get home, he's just peed
on my fresh laundry,

48:30.341 --> 48:32.308
all my fresh laundry.
And I was pissed.

48:32.310 --> 48:36.245
I was really, really mad 'cause
I had just done the laundry.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.014
I don't like doing laundry
particularly, so I-i,

48:38.016 --> 48:40.483
you know, I took him,
and I sat him down

48:40.485 --> 48:44.520
and I, uh, I peed
on him because i...

48:46.291 --> 48:48.457
<i>I tried to teach him a lesson.</i>

48:48.459 --> 48:49.458
<i>I was thinking, okay...</i>

48:49.460 --> 48:51.227
You pissed on your
fucking cat, bro?

48:51.229 --> 48:53.930
You pissed on your cat!

48:53.932 --> 48:56.132
<i>Okay, it was territorial.</i>

48:56.134 --> 48:58.501
- Long live Jack.
- Long live Jack.

48:58.503 --> 49:01.938
Urine-stained cat.

49:02.973 --> 49:05.274
<i>So good to see you!</i>

49:05.276 --> 49:06.642
Yeah, yeah.

49:06.644 --> 49:09.645
It's gonna be good, man.

49:14.184 --> 49:16.252
Who are you texting, man?

49:16.254 --> 49:17.119
Put your phone away.

49:17.121 --> 49:22.658
Oh, I'm seeing that, uh, I'm
seeing that Anna girl, 'member?

49:22.660 --> 49:25.194
That girl Emily's friend.

49:25.196 --> 49:29.165
Yeah, fuck, she's so cool man.

49:29.167 --> 49:32.068
I'm trying to play it
cool and everything,

49:32.070 --> 49:36.405
but I'm terrible at it,
I really like her.

49:36.407 --> 49:39.008
Yeah, she's great!

49:39.010 --> 49:41.010
Yeah.

49:42.312 --> 49:43.980
That's cool, man.

49:43.982 --> 49:46.015
Yeah.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.858
<i>When did you get back?</i>

52:10.594 --> 52:13.629
<i>Couple weeks ago, you?</i>

52:13.631 --> 52:17.166
<i>Oh, you know,
I've just been here.</i>

52:19.302 --> 52:20.803
<i>How have you been?</i>

52:20.805 --> 52:23.272
<i>Yeah, good.</i>

52:24.207 --> 52:25.574
<i>Good. You?</i>

52:25.576 --> 52:28.677
<i>Yeah, good.</i>

52:50.834 --> 52:54.904
When you went away, I found
it really difficult, and, uh,

52:54.906 --> 52:58.407
obviously, it was
harder for you.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.849
I can't go through that again.

53:09.252 --> 53:11.854
You won't, you wouldn't.

53:11.856 --> 53:15.624
Honestly, I'm so
much better now.

53:15.626 --> 53:17.526
I really am.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.696
I have a rule...

53:20.698 --> 53:24.967
Rules that I follow,
and a system, and it's working,

53:24.969 --> 53:30.573
and I've never felt
more, you know, okay.

53:30.575 --> 53:35.411
So, I'm not gonna do
that to you again.

53:36.846 --> 53:39.815
The only rule I broke
so far is coming to see you,

53:39.817 --> 53:42.718
'cause I'm not supposed
to get in touch with you,

53:42.720 --> 53:47.423
but that makes me
not feel good so...

53:57.601 --> 53:59.868
We can't go through that again.

53:59.870 --> 54:02.271
We won't.

55:38.936 --> 55:43.572
Help me.
Help me!

55:43.574 --> 55:47.643
Really!
Ouch.

55:47.645 --> 55:48.410
Please.

55:48.412 --> 55:50.579
There's a button on...
Stop.

55:50.581 --> 55:53.415
You're gonna pull my eyes
out of the sockets.

55:53.417 --> 55:55.884
There's a button on the back.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.619
- Please.
- Okay.

55:57.621 --> 56:00.889
Why did you try to pull
it off, it's your top.

56:00.891 --> 56:03.625
I was trying to be cool.

56:07.897 --> 56:12.034
<i>About a month ago
I was gonna call you.</i>

56:12.969 --> 56:15.003
<i>I did, but I hung up.</i>

56:15.005 --> 56:17.506
<i>I got scared.</i>

56:20.677 --> 56:22.544
<i>Of what?</i>

56:22.546 --> 56:25.948
<i>Of doing something
I shouldn't do.</i>

56:28.451 --> 56:35.991
<i>Or of you having a girlfriend
or being angry and not caring.</i>

56:36.393 --> 56:40.396
<i>Or you thinking I was
just some weird girl.</i>

56:57.414 --> 56:59.948
Crap!
Ah, shite bottles!

56:59.950 --> 57:01.583
Fuck it!

57:01.585 --> 57:03.752
Got the mop.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.087
You need a bucket.

57:05.089 --> 57:08.023
<i>Um, you find the bucket,
I'll find the...</i>

57:15.865 --> 57:17.733
How do mops actually work?

57:17.735 --> 57:20.135
That doesn't do anything.

57:20.137 --> 57:22.838
You're spreading it around.

57:30.013 --> 57:34.216
It was just the anniversary
of your brother, wasn't it?

57:35.985 --> 57:41.557
I mean, I know it was cause
it's a year since we met.

57:42.625 --> 57:48.897
Just want you to know that
I know, that I remembered.

58:19.863 --> 58:21.630
Hello!

58:32.041 --> 58:34.009
Fucking kiss me!

58:34.844 --> 58:36.712
Oh, fuck off, let's go.

58:40.518 --> 58:43.252
You really don't wanna
wear a suit, eh?

58:43.254 --> 58:43.919
Huh?

58:43.921 --> 58:46.522
You don't wanna wear a suit?

58:47.657 --> 58:48.824
This is like $100.

58:48.826 --> 58:51.894
I could get that
for like 5 bucks.

58:51.896 --> 58:55.998
No, you couldn't;
This is like really nice.

58:56.266 --> 58:59.801
Anyway, don't worry about
the money, doesn't matter.

58:59.803 --> 59:01.770
Try this one on.

59:02.205 --> 59:04.072
And the pants.

59:06.109 --> 59:07.943
And the cowboy thing.

59:11.648 --> 59:17.052
Ooh.
Hubba hubba, Mr. dreamboat.

59:17.054 --> 59:17.986
What?

59:17.988 --> 59:20.222
Good, you like it?

59:23.226 --> 59:24.793
Do you like it?

59:24.795 --> 59:29.064
It's a bit expensive, isn't it,
for second-hand clothing.

59:29.066 --> 59:30.666
Don't worry about it.

59:30.668 --> 59:33.602
What does that mean?
You're not paying for it.

59:33.604 --> 59:36.104
No, you're right, I'm not.

59:36.106 --> 59:38.240
What does that mean?

59:38.975 --> 59:41.777
Have you got daddy's card,
daddy's girl?

59:41.779 --> 59:43.912
- No.
- No?

59:43.914 --> 59:45.881
Yes.

59:45.883 --> 59:46.648
Wow.

59:46.650 --> 59:49.284
If it's too fast,
maybe I should just cancel it?

59:49.286 --> 59:50.686
I'm happy to meet your dad.

59:50.688 --> 59:54.590
It's for him, not for me, it's
for him, not for anybody else.

59:54.592 --> 59:56.658
It's just...

59:56.660 --> 59:58.694
Just what?

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.602
See you at 9:00, still?

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.975
I'll see you
at 9:00, still.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.382
<i>Hello?</i>

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:54.216
Hi, dad.

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:56.852
<i>Nick?
Uh, everything okay?</i>

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.053
Yeah.
Yeah, it is, yeah.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:01:01.323
Everything's, um,
everything's, yeah.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.358
All is well.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.294
<i>Good, good.</i>

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:07.729
<i>Um...</i>

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.198
<i>Do you wanna talk to your mum?</i>

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.235
No. No, don't fetch
mum, I was just...

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:15.303
I was calling to
speak to you, dad.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:17.706
I was wondering how you were.

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:22.077
<i>Fine, Nick.
Everything's fine.</i>

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:25.147
Good, I'm glad.
I'm really glad.

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:27.949
Really glad to hear that, dad.

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:28.717
I'm...

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:31.119
Hey, listen, I'm just
going out to, um,

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:35.290
meet my girlfriend's
parents tonight, and, uh,

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.325
just got me thinking
that maybe, um,

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:41.129
you and mum might wanna come
out and visit sometime.

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:43.265
That would be really...

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:50.739
<i>I'm not sure I can get
the time off work now, son.</i>

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:52.941
<i>And money's tight.</i>

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:54.976
<i>Yeah, of course, sure.</i>

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:56.878
<i>I understand completely.</i>

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.746
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:01.116
<i>Well, you know, maybe you can
mull it over or something.</i>

01:02:01.118 --> 01:02:03.885
<i>Okay.
Alright.</i>

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.321
<i>Alright, Nick, will do.</i>

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:08.223
<i>Okay, dad.</i>

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.762
Hello!

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:15.363
Hello again.

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:16.198
Hi, Nickie.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.101
<i>- And Marie.</i>
- Oh, I'm Marie.

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.103
It's two in Quebec.

01:02:21.105 --> 01:02:24.072
Okay.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.876
So, Nick whereabouts
are you from?

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:31.246
<i>Uh, dad, it's Nickie, actually.</i>

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.814
- Nickie?
- I'm sorry.

01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:35.283
What part of the UK
are you from, Nickie?

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:37.919
Um, I'm actually not from
the UK; I was born here,

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:39.421
but I grew up in the UK.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:41.356
I moved here when I was three.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:42.791
Oh, you were born here?

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:43.892
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Is that right?

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:46.762
How long have you two known each other?
I can't remember.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:50.065
<i>We've known each other
for quite a long time now.</i>

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:52.768
Haven't we?

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.036
Yes, please.

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.538
Thank you.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.041
Uh, four tasting menus, I think.

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:01.510
No, thank you.

01:03:01.512 --> 01:03:06.348
<i>Uh, Emily tells me
that you're an artist?</i>

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.350
Uh...

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:10.819
No, I drive a cab.

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:11.453
Well.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:16.258
<i>Well, uh, she said you were
into arts, so I just assumed.</i>

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:22.063
I studied music for a bit, so...

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:23.031
That's great!

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:24.533
<i>A long time ago now.</i>

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:25.934
What do your parents do?

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:30.205
<i>My dad's a security guard,
my mum, she works at a school.</i>

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:31.239
That's nice.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:34.142
So, my work is going
really well right now.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:35.310
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:38.513
I just love your ladybugs;
They're beautiful.

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:41.883
Yeah.
I think they're great.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:43.151
My dad's a comedian.

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:45.420
He hasn't actually
seen any of it.

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:46.488
<i>How is a comedian...</i>

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.324
You just haven't
looked at any of it.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.492
Yeah, I have.

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.327
<i>No, you have not.</i>

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.495
<i>It's okay, it's okay.</i>

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.831
<i>I will unveil them
one day to you.</i>

01:03:55.833 --> 01:04:01.102
Um, we have a very, um, we
have a request for you, dad.

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:03.839
We have an investment
proposition for you, actually.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:08.109
Um, because I've been looking
at all these schools in the UK,

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:09.477
and because com...

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:12.047
It's very competitive
right now, as you know,

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:14.316
<i>and-and so if you don't
get into the top school,</i>

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:19.254
<i>you might as well just give up
and start popping out babies.</i>

01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:20.922
<i>Joke.</i>

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:22.357
Joke.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:25.126
<i>Did you look at any
schools closer to home, maybe?</i>

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:29.231
Well, the thing is that, um,
even if I had a good scholarship

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:30.298
or whatever, I would...

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.167
I would still have to
take out loans,

01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:33.635
and then that would
affect both of us,

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:37.572
because we would be raked over
the coals for the next 70 years.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:41.877
<i>Right, so, um, we just wanted
to know if you wanted</i>

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:43.245
to give us a loan, actually.

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:45.614
Instead of going through
the bank, right, so...

01:04:45.616 --> 01:04:48.116
We would pay it back quickly,

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:50.352
because we're both really
good at what we do,

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:55.156
and-and we just kinda wanna
avoid all the interest,

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:59.394
you know, and-and
the bank foreclosures,

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:05.500
or whatever, destiny
foreclosures or whatever.

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:10.005
<i>We would pay it back, of course!</i>

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:12.440
And my-my work is
so strong right now,

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.009
and my portfolio is so solid.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:18.013
I just feel like we just need
a little bit of extra help,

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.448
and then we'd be fine.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:28.690
Anyhow, it'd be great
if you found

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:30.659
a school closer to us, right?

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:34.629
Marie, I love you, I'm talking
to my father right now.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:38.667
<i>No disrespect, no disrespect.</i>

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.938
Okay.
Alright.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.442
Well, uh, I think
your portfolio is great, um,

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:51.513
<i>but I don't think
you're quite there yet.</i>

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:52.981
What does "quite there" mean?

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:55.317
You haven't seen any of my work.

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.185
<i>You haven't even
looked at it, dad.</i>

01:05:57.187 --> 01:06:00.021
That's not what I'm
talking about.

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:03.425
<i>It's prosciutto
wrapped in asparagus</i>

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:05.193
<i>with truffle-infused
balsamic vinegar.</i>

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:08.663
Sorry, we don't really care about
your truffle infusion right now.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:13.134
<i>Emily, please.
Sweetie.</i>

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.971
Sorry.

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:18.106
Thank you very much.

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:19.307
Okay.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:20.675
Dad.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:22.210
I apologize, I apologize.

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:24.112
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:29.551
But you were on the other side
of this table, were you not?

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:30.752
With my grandfather?

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:32.220
<i>When you asked him for money</i>

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:37.125
<i>so that you could make
your life happen?</i>

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:38.760
Em.

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:53.274
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.660
I didn't know she
was gonna do that.

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:14.195
I don't want anything from you.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:16.464
<i>I just wanna make
that really clear.</i>

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:17.399
<i>I just thought that...</i>

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:20.335
I know what she's
like, it's okay.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:23.738
I did, I mean, I wanted
to meet you.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:29.511
<i>Emily's involved in a process
that requires rest,</i>

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:34.282
quiet, and social simplicity.

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:37.185
So, based on what I can see,
I think it's best

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:42.557
that you and Emily stop seeing
each other for a while.

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:49.764
I don't think it's
your place to say that.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.734
<i>You don't know
the girl in there.</i>

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:55.203
And you don't know me.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.406
You don't know
one thing about me.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:01.743
So, what are you gonna
do when she's very sick,

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:06.281
and she refuses to take
her medication?

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:09.417
What are you gonna do when
she takes her medication,

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.853
and she's still very sick?

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:15.290
I don't know,

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:18.460
but I'll cross
that bridge with her

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:21.696
when she gets there,
if she gets there,

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:25.466
'cause right now, she's doing
really well, isn't she?

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:26.835
<i>I mean, isn't she?</i>

01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:29.703
It's very hard to say.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:32.573
Looks to me like another
fling into health.

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:35.877
It's where a person thinks
they're standing on solid ground

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:39.279
but really, they're on-on...

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.283
Quicksand.

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.754
She needs time, Nickie.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:48.356
<i>Look, maybe in a little while,</i>

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:50.591
<i>if she can maintain some
sort of equilibrium,</i>

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:54.429
<i>and you both still feel
the same way about each other,</i>

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.430
<i>then who knows?</i>

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:59.434
<i>But for now,
it's not a good idea.</i>

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:03.304
I'm gonna go and check on Emily.

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.276
<i>I was right where you are.</i>

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:09.377
<i>You know that?</i>

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:11.578
I mean, Emily's mother was doing

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:18.286
about the same just before
she-she took her own life and...

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.423
We thought we had
it figured out.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:30.899
<i>And from what I can see,
you're not capable.</i>

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.468
<i>Don't make this
any more difficult</i>

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.904
<i>than it already is for her.</i>

01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:38.206
<i>Okay?</i>

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:45.613
Nick, where are you going?

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:47.549
Em.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.484
You should've told me that
you were gonna say that.

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:52.287
- I know.
- Well, why didn't you?

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.656
Because. Because you wouldn't
have wanted me to,

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:56.324
and-and money means
nothing to him, Nick.

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:58.760
I don't need money.
I don't need your dad's money.

01:09:58.762 --> 01:10:02.430
Okay, then we won't...
We won't take it then.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:06.668
It's not about money, em.

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:10.838
Okay, okay.

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:15.343
I just don't wanna waste
any more time.

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:20.415
I know what I want, and I know
who I want it with.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.984
Is that wrong?

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:30.525
Would you tell me if
I was bad for you?

01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:31.326
Would you?

01:10:31.328 --> 01:10:33.995
Em, would you know if I was?

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:37.799
What did he say to you?

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:45.873
He's not my doctor.

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:50.645
I have a doctor, and she says
I'm doing really well.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:53.314
She says when it's adolescent
onset, 'cause I was 15

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:58.419
when it first happened, that it
can be very hard to balance,

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:02.490
but I found a balance, Nick.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:04.559
My medication doesn't
make me feel like a robot.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:08.429
It makes me feel
actually pretty good.

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:13.301
It's not always perfect, but...

01:11:13.303 --> 01:11:15.870
You believe me, right?

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:23.378
Good, 'cause I'm not a leper.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.746
What if I am?

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:25.913
You're not a leper.

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:27.382
I'm not a leper.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.616
Em.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:31.319
If you need anything,
if you need something,

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.621
you need to tell me.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:40.361
You're not doing this
by yourself, nor am I.

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:46.067
Okay.
Okay.

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:59.414
I love you, Nick.

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:03.484
I'm in love with you.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:10.858
Oh come on, come on!

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.393
Come on!

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:13.828
Come on.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.597
You can do it harder
than that, seriously.

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:22.804
- Can you unpack me, please?
- Sure, no problem.

01:12:22.806 --> 01:12:25.773
<i>- No, not my...</i>
- Got something here.

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:27.575
Little bit down here.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:30.111
Uh-huh, what'd you find?

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:32.480
Woah, it's quite squidgy.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:33.414
Squidgy?

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:37.118
I'm not even ticklish
right now, go ahead.

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:43.992
Ow!

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:53.368
Hey, that's my really delicate
fucking sweaters.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.938
Watch what you're doing!

01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.408
Watch what you're doing?

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:04.679
You're gonna have to leave
the house sometimes though.

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.853
What?

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:13.755
For private stuff.

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.656
So you can shit?

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:16.758
No!

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.759
What!

01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:20.428
Don't say it like that.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.863
I don't do that.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:25.566
I don't.

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:33.441
Okay. Okay! Yeah,
I'm waiting for the beat.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:34.842
- What?
- Nothing.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:38.079
- <i>What?</i>
- Sorry, you looked accusing.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.113
<i>Did I?</i>

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:41.416
You're like...

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:44.085
A-five, six, seven, eight.

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:53.895
I don't wanna sing this.

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:56.831
I don't wanna sing about that.

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.427
Em?

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:56.404
Em?

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:09.817
- - Oh, fucking hell!

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.689
Got ya!

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:17.725
I made dinner.

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:19.460
<i>Yeah, I saw.
Thanks.</i>

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:21.929
<i>You're welcome.</i>

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.700
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:29.403
Why does something
have to be wrong?

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.105
It doesn't.

01:18:31.107 --> 01:18:33.808
It's just because
you seem upset.

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:35.743
Come on.
You're freaking me out.

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:37.478
You wanna know
what I'm thinking.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.947
<i>Yes, I want you to tell
me what you're thinking.</i>

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:42.717
<i>Or whatever you wanna tell me.</i>

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.853
Please, Nick.

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:46.854
You're freaking me out.

01:18:46.856 --> 01:18:49.890
Fucking please, get off me!

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:56.897
- Em?
- Yeah?

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:02.403
- Em?
- Do you wanna go eat something?

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:06.240
- Em?
- Why don't you go sit down and eat?

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.075
Em?

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.883
I'm trying to apologize.

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:17.818
<i>I know.</i>

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:24.258
<i>What's so funny?</i>

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.798
<i>What's so funny?</i>

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.767
Nothing.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.270
<i>What?</i>

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:41.909
Your apology is like angrier
than your real voice.

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:09.270
<i>Wanna come for a walk?
No, thank you.</i>

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:10.905
<i>It's a really nice day.</i>

01:20:10.907 --> 01:20:14.241
<i>- No, thanks.
- Okay.</i>

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:17.378
<i>We can cancel, you know?</i>

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.281
<i>No, no, I don't
want you to cancel.</i>

01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:22.850
<i>Don't cancel.</i>

01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:26.554
<i>I'm just gonna tell
my mum to get a cab then.</i>

01:20:26.556 --> 01:20:30.891
No, hey, you-you go, okay?

01:20:30.893 --> 01:20:32.560
I'll be fine once you're back.

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:35.896
I just have the jitters.

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:40.034
You think I'm gonna run
into a bus or something?

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:43.470
- <i>Hey.</i>
- No, course not.

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:48.142
I just, I'm not gonna go.

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:50.477
No, no, go.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:53.881
I'm communicating
and telling you

01:20:53.883 --> 01:20:59.320
that I need some space, okay?

01:20:59.322 --> 01:21:00.054
Okay.

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:04.024
I'm telling you I'm gonna
be okay when you get back.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:04.625
Okay.

01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:06.227
Well, I'm gonna take
your cell, yeah?

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:09.864
You give me a call if you,
if you need anything.

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:13.868
I can grab whatever you
want on the way back.

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:24.371
<i>- Hiya.
- Hiya.</i>

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:28.208
<i>I can't believe you're
sat next to me.</i>

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:30.477
<i>Stop looking at me, mum.</i>

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:32.713
<i>Oh, you look so well.</i>

01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:34.081
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.317
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:38.218
<i>Hey, mum, I'm sorry
Emily can't be here,</i>

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.388
<i>she's feeling a bit tired,
but she'll be up and about</i>

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.190
<i>when we get back, I think.</i>

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:46.026
<i>- That's okay, Nick.
- Alright.</i>

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:49.163
<i>Your father sends his regards.</i>

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.239
Hello?

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:01.008
- Em?
<i>- Hi.</i>

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:04.378
Hi, I'm Katherine,
Nick's mother.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:07.414
I'm Emily, nice to meet you.

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:10.351
Nice to meet you, sweetheart.

01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:12.653
Look at you.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:15.022
You're so very pretty.

01:23:15.024 --> 01:23:16.423
Thank you.

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:18.359
Alright, mum, you're
gonna scare her.

01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:20.127
<i>No, it's nice, it's nice.</i>

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:23.030
<i>Do you want, um, do you
want wine or anything?</i>

01:23:23.032 --> 01:23:24.665
<i>I'd love some.</i>

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:26.033
What's with all the candles?

01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:29.403
Um, I thought it was more
romantic this way.

01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:31.305
It's beautiful.

01:23:31.307 --> 01:23:32.206
Might be too many.

01:23:32.208 --> 01:23:34.775
- No.
- <i>I don't know.</i>

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:36.243
It's very nice, I like it.

01:23:36.245 --> 01:23:38.345
<i>Good, good.
What wine...</i>

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:39.747
- <i>did you want wine?</i>
- Sure.

01:23:39.749 --> 01:23:41.382
<i>- What do you want?
- Red, please.</i>

01:23:41.384 --> 01:23:42.383
<i>- Red?
- Yes.</i>

01:23:42.385 --> 01:23:45.586
<i>Perfect, 'cause that's
kind of all we have.</i>

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:48.722
It's beautiful, really great.

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.024
- Good.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:51.658
What's the special occasion?

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:56.397
You guys getting married
or having kids?

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.200
No.

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:02.236
<i>What about you?</i>

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:03.237
Should we tell them?

01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:05.706
I think it's... I think
we should tell 'em.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.574
Do you wanna tell
them, or should I?

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:12.746
Well, I think, um,
we've got some news.

01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:19.119
<i>We're getting married, and
it's because she's pregnant.</i>

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:20.721
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:26.593
No.

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:28.562
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:32.266
<i>No, em, I'm not, oh, my god.</i>

01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:35.269
<i>Sorry, I gave that away.</i>

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:40.140
<i>It was a bad joke.</i>

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:44.244
<i>He was just joking.</i>

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:48.549
May I make a toast?

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:51.151
<i>Sure, yeah.</i>

01:24:51.153 --> 01:24:52.119
Mum, you don't...

01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:56.156
Yes, I want to make
a toast, please let me.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:07.167
I've missed Nickie so much
over the past two years,

01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:12.272
and I'm so glad now to have
come and met you all,

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:20.274
because it makes it much easier
to know that he's happy here.

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:28.422
<i>It makes us very, very
happy to know that Nick has...</i>

01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:35.162
<i>Has started a new life here.</i>

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:52.346
<i>What, darling?
What is it?</i>

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:58.652
It's just, you know.

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.629
He's just my whole
heart, you know?

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:22.910
Come on, let's go to sleep.

01:26:22.912 --> 01:26:24.778
Okay.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:02.716
<i>Beautiful man, beautiful man.</i>

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:05.419
<i>You beautiful, lovely man.</i>

01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:07.254
<i>You beautiful, sweet man.</i>

01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:09.690
Look at you, you beautiful man.

01:27:09.692 --> 01:27:13.627
Your fingers, your fingers, your
skin, your beautiful skin,

01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:16.897
and your fingers,
and your beautiful hair.

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:19.333
Your skin and
your beautiful fingers.

01:27:19.335 --> 01:27:23.670
Your beautiful face,
and your beautiful love.

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:26.473
Shh.

01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:28.775
Shh.

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:12.819
Em?

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:22.863
Em?

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:27.401
Emily.

01:28:27.403 --> 01:28:30.003
Come back to bed.

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:46.920
Em.

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:58.065
<i>Holy fuck, em.</i>

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:00.734
Em?

01:29:00.736 --> 01:29:02.336
Emily?

01:29:02.338 --> 01:29:03.370
Mum?

01:29:03.372 --> 01:29:04.738
<i>What is it, Nickie?</i>

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.407
Go back to bed.
It's okay.

01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:09.576
<i>What is it?</i>

01:30:58.186 --> 01:31:01.121
Em, em?

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:04.858
Emily, look at me.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.894
I am right here with you.

01:31:07.896 --> 01:31:12.833
Yes, I am, I am right
here with you.

01:31:12.835 --> 01:31:13.834
Yeah.

01:31:13.836 --> 01:31:15.635
I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:31:15.637 --> 01:31:17.237
I can't have this, Nickie.

01:31:17.239 --> 01:31:19.973
Can't have what?
What can't you have?

01:31:19.975 --> 01:31:23.043
- I can't...
- You can't what?

01:31:23.045 --> 01:31:26.613
I can't, I can't.

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:29.249
You can't what?

01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:35.121
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna be awake.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.160
I understand, em.

01:31:40.162 --> 01:31:43.697
Where were you, Nickie?

01:31:43.699 --> 01:31:46.066
What do you mean, where was I?

01:31:46.068 --> 01:31:49.569
I didn't see you.

01:31:49.571 --> 01:31:51.505
I didn't see you, Nickie.

01:31:51.507 --> 01:31:54.875
You didn't see me where, em?

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:58.211
I can't see you, Nickie.

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.548
I'm right here.

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:04.751
I wanna be old with
you on this bench.

01:32:04.753 --> 01:32:05.852
Yeah?

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:09.990
I wanna be old with you, and we
know that it all worked out.

01:32:09.992 --> 01:32:12.559
I wanna be...

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:17.631
Is it gonna work out, Nickie?

01:32:17.633 --> 01:32:20.967
Yeah, it is.

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:22.903
How do you know?

01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:26.239
I just know, I know
'cause I'm here,

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:30.310
and I'm gonna look
after you, I promise.

01:32:30.312 --> 01:32:32.946

01:32:35.183 --> 01:32:36.850
Okay, okay.

I just, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:42.622
Okay.

Okay, em, look at me.

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:46.226
I need you...

01:32:46.228 --> 01:32:51.731
I need you to start taking
your medication again, okay?

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:54.601
I just need you to do that.

01:32:54.603 --> 01:32:56.169
Okay?

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:00.040
Em.

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:03.577
I am taking my medication.

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:13.653
What do you mean?

01:33:13.655 --> 01:33:15.855
I'm taking it.

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:22.195
Okay.

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:30.837
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:34.140
I'm sorry.

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:37.978
It's okay.

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:45.385
I'm gonna call us a cab, okay?

01:33:45.387 --> 01:33:49.122
I'm gonna call us a cab.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:53.927
Okay?
I'm right here.

01:33:53.929 --> 01:33:56.796
I'm right here.

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:07.407
We should go now, Nick.

01:34:07.409 --> 01:34:08.742
- Huh?
- We need to go.

01:34:08.744 --> 01:34:10.010
I called the cab, remember?

01:34:10.012 --> 01:34:11.344
- The cab's coming.
- Please, Nick.

01:34:11.346 --> 01:34:12.345
- I know.
- Please.

01:34:12.347 --> 01:34:14.147
- I know.
- Let's go now, okay?

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:16.249
Okay, well, why don't
we sit down on the bench,

01:34:16.251 --> 01:34:20.320
and wait until,
until the cab comes.

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:23.356
- Hey. - Hey, hey, kids?
- I just needed help.

01:34:23.358 --> 01:34:25.358
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.927
<i>Emily, are you okay?</i>

01:34:27.929 --> 01:34:29.396
Okay, Nick.

01:34:29.398 --> 01:34:30.897
<i>Emily.</i>

Oh, thanks, mum.

Hello.

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:53.379
Thank you, I'll be down now.

01:35:53.948 --> 01:35:56.783
Should I come with you, Nick?

01:35:56.785 --> 01:35:59.185
<i>No.</i>

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:18.438
