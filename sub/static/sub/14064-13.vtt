WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:01.835
<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.835 --> 00:02.915
Denny got engaged.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.713
–Who is it this time?
–Beverly Bridge.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.877
The woman Denny “Craned”
in the coatroom at that charity dinner.

00:06.877 --> 00:09.963
–Denny Crane…
–If Denny becomes incapacitated…

00:09.998 --> 00:10.773
I'm having a stroke.

00:10.773 --> 00:12.174
She could bring down the firm.

00:12.174 --> 00:14.664
–Maybe you're in love.
–I am delirious with joy.

00:14.664 --> 00:17.119
How come you're getting involved
with a dead guy?

00:17.119 --> 00:19.589
I, uh, try not to think about it.

00:19.624 --> 00:22.024
There is nothing romantic about this.

00:22.059 --> 00:24.648
It turns you into a corpse before you die.

00:24.683 --> 00:26.839
It is not too late to get out.

00:26.874 --> 00:28.995
I start chemo again tomorrow.

00:29.941 --> 00:30.917
Okay…

01:22.874 --> 01:24.959
Thank you.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.132
Hello. May I help you, ma'am?

01:31.167 --> 01:33.885
Yes, you may, dear.

01:35.219 --> 01:38.671
Take all the money out of the drawer
and put it in a bag, please.

01:38.671 --> 01:39.650
Yes.

01:41.594 --> 01:46.218
Oh, and put some of that delicious
beef jerky in there, too.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.219
Mr Shore,

02:10.253 --> 02:11.964
She said to call you.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.549
Thank you, Lawrence.

02:32.067 --> 02:35.696
In a way, I suppose this is all your fault.

02:35.731 --> 02:37.717
Oh, dear God how, Catherine?

02:37.752 --> 02:42.700
How is it that you holding up a convenience
store suddenly becomes my fault?

02:42.821 --> 02:47.284
You said you would hire me as your
personal assistant after the firm fired
me,

02:47.284 --> 02:50.127
and I took you at your lying word.

02:50.162 --> 02:51.962
Bad Catherine, bad!

02:54.256 --> 02:57.926
It was a terrible thing to forget, and I'm sorry,

02:57.961 --> 03:00.602
but you are in a lot of trouble here.

03:00.637 --> 03:03.848
What else was I to do?
A gal's got to eat.

03:03.883 --> 03:07.060
And robbery isn't as bad
as killing a man,

03:07.095 --> 03:08.645
and you got me off on that.

03:08.645 --> 03:13.567
And you've done wonders
with your second chance.

03:14.735 --> 03:16.555
Stay here.

03:29.332 --> 03:31.007
Good evening.

03:31.042 --> 03:34.629
I understand you recently
suffered a robbery.

03:34.664 --> 03:36.047
You a lawyer?

03:36.089 --> 03:37.555
Actually, I'm here more as a

03:37.555 --> 03:40.427
friend to the befuddled old woman who…

03:40.468 --> 03:42.144
Robbed me.

03:42.179 --> 03:44.925
Do you know how many times
I have been held up this year?

03:44.925 --> 03:49.272
Far too many for you to appreciate
her little prank, I'm sure.

03:49.307 --> 03:52.395
May I ask if that's your car out front,

03:52.430 --> 03:55.483
the Datsun with the dents in the side?

03:55.518 --> 03:57.033
Yeah.

03:57.068 --> 04:00.304
I have a friend who has a friend.

04:00.339 --> 04:03.540
He's a magician with bodywork.

04:03.575 --> 04:05.945
He'll make those dents disappear,
change the color.

04:05.945 --> 04:12.834
He'll make that Datsun look
exactly like a late-model BMW

04:16.921 --> 04:20.757
Can he make the seats look like leather?

04:20.793 --> 04:23.475
The man's a miracle worker.

04:56.419 --> 04:57.677
We got a problem.

04:57.712 --> 04:59.297
Another sector car called it in.

04:59.297 --> 05:01.167
I don't have any choice.
I've got to book her.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.667
It's late. She's elderly.

05:02.686 --> 05:04.597
Can't we at least defer the arrest?

05:04.597 --> 05:06.577
–I don't know.
–Lawrence, please.

05:08.410 --> 05:11.230
–You owe me.
–Thank you. You won't regret this.

05:11.260 --> 05:13.734
Excuse me, officer?

05:13.769 --> 05:16.917
Can I get my gun back, please?

05:29.451 --> 05:31.954
When ADA Raines gets back,
have her call me immediately.

05:31.954 --> 05:33.694
<i>–Yes, sir.</i>
–Thank you.

05:34.874 --> 05:37.001
Could I borrow you for a minute?

05:37.036 --> 05:39.128
Opposing counsel has made an offer.

05:39.128 --> 05:41.373
I'm trying to get these people to take it.

05:41.373 --> 05:45.336
I'm hoping that you can explain
to them that this is as good as it gets.

05:45.336 --> 05:46.725
Do I get a hint?

05:46.760 --> 05:48.950
It involves invasion of privacy.

05:48.985 --> 05:51.140
A woman, Jackie Hayden, access was

05:51.223 --> 05:53.469
gained to her personal medical records.

05:53.469 --> 05:55.462
Invasion of privacy, there's an

05:55.561 --> 05:57.556
increasingly familiar tune these days.

05:57.556 --> 05:59.055
This is a little worse than your

05:59.055 --> 06:01.056
typical case of someone being denied a job

06:01.056 --> 06:02.587
because of a preexisting condition.

06:02.587 --> 06:03.776
How much worse?

06:03.811 --> 06:06.639
He never beat me, just my mother.

06:06.674 --> 06:08.867
I finally got out when I was 16.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.025
A few years later, Emily's mom

06:11.060 --> 06:13.051
Jackie came to us at the women's shelter.

06:13.051 --> 06:13.951
She was a mess.

06:13.961 --> 06:16.465
They promised my dad
would never find her there.

06:16.465 --> 06:18.788
For obvious reasons, the name, phone number

06:18.788 --> 06:21.072
and location of the shelter are kept confidential.

06:21.072 --> 06:23.322
We put Emily's mom in touch
with a psychiatrist for

06:23.322 --> 06:24.844
post-traumatic stress disorder.

06:24.844 --> 06:26.331
The cost of which was covered…

06:26.331 --> 06:27.508
Under her HMO.

06:27.543 --> 06:31.618
Unfortunately, the HMO,
“Well Benefits” posted Jackie's information,

06:31.618 --> 06:35.659
including the name and address
of her psychiatrist on their web site.

06:35.659 --> 06:37.417
Emily's father found Jackie's

06:37.452 --> 06:39.789
psychiatrist via the “Well Benefits” web site

06:39.789 --> 06:42.262
and tracked her down
at the psychiatrist's office.

06:42.262 --> 06:43.740
And that's where…

06:44.484 --> 06:46.924
he killed her.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.857
So this is a wrongful death action,

06:48.857 --> 06:50.961
and Well Benefits has offered you
a settlement?

06:50.961 --> 06:54.195
$20,000, no admission of liability.

06:54.230 --> 06:58.658
Regarding the settlement,
I have to agree.

06:58.693 --> 07:00.334
–Thank you, Alan.
–Not with you.

07:00.334 --> 07:01.386
With you.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.261
The offer is insulting. These people
need to be taught a lesson.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.702
Would you excuse us one moment?

07:12.178 --> 07:14.104
$20,000.

07:14.139 --> 07:16.697
That's a lot of money
for a 19-year-old girl,

07:16.697 --> 07:19.217
and I brought you in
to make this go away.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.485
I won't do that.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.582
What happened to Jackie Hayden
was a nightmare,

07:23.617 --> 07:26.128
but to blame the HMO, there was a
supervening act.

07:26.128 --> 07:28.605
Technically, well benefits didn't break
the law.

07:28.605 --> 07:30.624
But there was a foreseeable danger.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.676
There are consequences in this case,

07:32.676 --> 07:34.701
dire consequences to putting someone's

07:34.701 --> 07:36.786
most personal information on the internet.

07:36.786 --> 07:38.621
Well benefits should have known that.

07:38.621 --> 07:41.624
I say we clobber them over the head with it.

07:42.024 --> 07:44.662
This is why people don't ask your opinion a lot.

07:44.662 --> 07:47.069
Most likely.

08:00.268 --> 08:03.743
Lorraine, ham and provolone on a baguette.

08:09.443 --> 08:12.008
Do you have anything without bread?

08:12.043 --> 08:14.538
These are sandwiches. They have bread.

08:14.573 --> 08:17.273
Well, there's a thing called “protein style”.

08:17.278 --> 08:19.644
Yeah, if it don't have bread, it ain't

08:19.679 --> 08:22.010
a sandwich, and I only do sandwiches.

08:22.456 --> 08:25.584
Do you know who I am?
I am Denny Crane's fiancée.

08:25.668 --> 08:27.443
Yeah, so?

08:30.005 --> 08:33.102
Hey, Mr Chase, roast beef and havarti.

08:54.738 --> 08:56.188
Catherine, what are you doing here?

08:56.188 --> 08:57.852
I just tried to reach you at your house.

08:57.852 --> 08:59.482
I was in the neighborhood. I wanted to see

08:59.482 --> 09:01.049
if there was any news on my case.

09:01.049 --> 09:04.605
There isn't.  I put in a call to the
DA's office.  I have yet to hear back.

09:04.605 --> 09:06.365
Now about your finances…

09:06.400 --> 09:09.872
Oh, we can talk finances and trial strategy.

09:09.907 --> 09:13.345
Um, can we use osteoporosis as a defense?

09:14.166 --> 09:15.506
Do you have it?

09:15.541 --> 09:20.179
No, but I have a little pillow I can put
under my shirt.

09:20.315 --> 09:22.448
We'll keep that in our arsenal.

09:22.483 --> 09:23.332
So Catherine…

09:23.367 --> 09:24.662
Do you want to talk more now?

09:24.662 --> 09:27.574
I was gonna catch up with the girls in
word processing.

09:27.574 --> 09:30.802
Oh, okay. Why don't you do that?

09:30.837 --> 09:33.995
But don't worry. I'll be here.

09:34.030 --> 09:37.703
I've cleared my schedule. This gets top priority.

09:37.738 --> 09:41.376
As it should, given you're facing 25 to life.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.671
What happened to the sandwich guy?

09:52.706 --> 09:54.846
Uh, Bev fired him.

09:54.881 --> 09:57.669
–Bev doesn't work here.
–Well, then I fired him.

09:57.669 --> 10:00.095
Denny, I thought we agreed you wouldn't

10:00.178 --> 10:02.507
fire anyone after you let Vicky Donchey go.

10:02.507 --> 10:03.900
She wasn't pulling her weight.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.523
She was a client.

10:05.558 --> 10:07.060
Let me tell you something, Shirley.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.723
You know why this firm is going into the dumper?

10:09.723 --> 10:12.023
Our profits were up 5% last quarter.

10:12.058 --> 10:13.858
People are being coddled.

10:13.893 --> 10:17.535
Bunch of layabouts.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.675
Be careful of the cuticle, Ming.

10:21.359 --> 10:25.001
Denny… it's starting.

10:25.036 --> 10:26.663
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:26.663 --> 10:28.738
Bev, she's following a similar

10:28.773 --> 10:31.251
pattern to your five previous wives.

10:31.334 --> 10:33.435
It starts with her firing the sandwich guy

10:33.435 --> 10:35.485
and ends with her influencing policy at

10:35.485 --> 10:37.548
this firm, and it will not be tolerated.

10:37.548 --> 10:39.717
Now, Shirley, we both know what this is all about.

10:39.717 --> 10:42.025
No, we do not both know what this is about.

10:42.025 --> 10:44.377
It's not about me being jealous of Bev.

10:44.412 --> 10:46.765
It's about getting the sandwich guy back!

10:46.765 --> 10:49.530
All right, all right. Jeez,

10:49.565 --> 10:52.934
if I'd known it was such a big deal…
I'll talk to Bev.

10:54.824 --> 10:56.802
Happy ending, Mr Crane?

10:58.096 --> 11:00.447
Oh, not today, Ming.

11:00.482 --> 11:02.798
I'm engaged now.

11:08.704 --> 11:10.741
<i>Wellesley memorial, oncology.</i>

11:10.741 --> 11:12.798
Room 4175.

11:12.833 --> 11:15.509
<i>There is a phone block on that room.</i>

11:15.544 --> 11:19.423
Could you help me out here?  I'm his,
um, girlfriend.

11:19.458 --> 11:22.385
Hold one second, please.

11:23.260 --> 11:27.198
<i>Hello, Ms Bauer?  This is Laura
Buckingham, Mr Post's personal
assistant.</i>

11:27.198 --> 11:29.975
Oh, thank God! How is the chemo going?

11:30.010 --> 11:31.387
<i>He's indisposed at the moment,</i>

11:31.387 --> 11:34.598
<i>but he wanted me to personally assure
you he's well.</i>

11:34.598 --> 11:38.318
<i>I will phone you in a few days following
his treatment.</i>

11:39.193 --> 11:44.448
Uh, could you tell Mr Post that, um…

11:44.483 --> 11:47.583
Tell him I, um…

11:47.618 --> 11:51.455
–I'm thinking of him.
<i>–I will.</i>

11:55.376 --> 11:57.104
They're here.

11:58.295 --> 11:59.796
Let's go.

11:59.831 --> 12:01.298
Rejected?

12:01.340 --> 12:02.633
You've got to be kidding!

12:02.633 --> 12:04.426
No, I'm much funnier when I'm kidding.

12:04.426 --> 12:07.256
–I thought this was worked out.
–I thought so, too.

12:07.256 --> 12:10.432
After further consideration, we decided
that the offer was inadequate.

12:10.432 --> 12:12.309
Oh, what a bunch of crap!

12:12.392 --> 12:14.691
Young lady, I don't know
what nonsense these lawyers

12:14.691 --> 12:16.955
have been telling you about HMOs
and their deep pockets.

12:16.955 --> 12:19.272
Please direct your unfounded arrogance at me.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.133
Okay, fine.

12:20.168 --> 12:23.130
You two are just trying to make an issue
when there is no issue.

12:23.130 --> 12:24.203
No issue? I'm sorry.

12:24.203 --> 12:27.299
Did this young woman's mother suddenly
spring back to life?

12:27.299 --> 12:30.361
Her father killed her mother, and we are
all upset about that,

12:30.361 --> 12:33.640
but it was not our fault.  However, to
make this go away,

12:33.640 --> 12:36.316
we were willing to give her a gift of $20,000.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.479
Well, as a gift, that's very sweet of you.

12:38.479 --> 12:40.572
We'll put it in the den next to the armoire.

12:40.572 --> 12:43.313
However, as compensation
that you owe Emily Hayden

12:43.313 --> 12:46.053
because your negligence led to her
mother being brutally murdered,

12:46.053 --> 12:49.750
your offer is offensive, even more
offensive than your tone.

12:50.469 --> 12:51.777
We're done!

12:52.754 --> 12:55.800
The law is on our side, Mr Shore.

12:55.835 --> 12:57.786
Tragedies happen every day.

12:57.821 --> 13:01.211
Yes, and you're about
to experience one firsthand.

13:01.246 --> 13:03.246
See you in court.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.859
Aren't you glad you brought me on board?

13:21.336 --> 13:23.671
Mr Hayden, is it true you stabbed your

13:23.755 --> 13:25.006
wife to death with a kitchen knife?

13:25.006 --> 13:26.052
Yes.

13:26.084 --> 13:28.026
–You hunted her down?
–Yes.

13:28.061 --> 13:29.934
–You lay in wait?
–Yes.

13:29.969 --> 13:32.472
And finally, after you both exchanged words,

13:32.472 --> 13:36.205
you pulled the knife out and stabbed her
seven times in the chest.

13:36.205 --> 13:37.332
Yes.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.225
Before you killed Emily's mother Jackie,

13:40.260 --> 13:43.972
she was living at Renew, a battered
women's shelter?

13:44.007 --> 13:45.622
That was my understanding.

13:45.657 --> 13:49.187
A shelter, the location of which was
kept confidential.

13:49.222 --> 13:50.407
As far as I knew.

13:50.442 --> 13:53.588
Could you tell us how you came to learn
of Jackie's whereabouts?

13:53.588 --> 13:56.093
–My computer.
–Specifically?

13:56.128 --> 13:58.754
I logged on to Well Benefits' web site.

13:58.789 --> 13:59.790
Jackie's HMO.

13:59.825 --> 14:02.861
I had her social security number and her
date of birth.

14:02.861 --> 14:05.381
That's all I needed to access the records.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.650
And what did you find?

14:06.650 --> 14:08.634
Her explanation of benefits.

14:08.669 --> 14:11.444
It had on it what she was being treated for,

14:11.479 --> 14:14.433
the location of her doctor and what her
co-pay was.

14:14.433 --> 14:17.352
I noticed she was seeing the same shrink
every Monday,

14:17.352 --> 14:20.696
so I went and waited for her outside his office.

14:35.868 --> 14:37.573
Emily?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.667
The good was we just made a strong

14:43.702 --> 14:46.086
opening impression with the jury.

14:46.170 --> 14:49.013
The bad was you just had to listen to testimony

14:49.048 --> 14:50.674
of how your father killed your mother.

14:50.674 --> 14:54.274
That's something that nobody should ever
have to experience.

14:58.557 --> 15:01.476
Here's what you should know about lawyers.

15:01.511 --> 15:07.350
I could have sat you down and prepared you
for this testimony so as to brace you.

15:07.351 --> 15:09.491
I chose not to.

15:09.526 --> 15:13.322
No tears for the plaintiff,
no tears for the jury,

15:13.357 --> 15:16.158
less money.

15:17.618 --> 15:20.391
But, Emily, we don't have
to keep going here.

15:20.426 --> 15:23.165
–If you feel this…
–I want to keep going.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.584
You're sure?

15:25.619 --> 15:27.169
Yes.

15:29.963 --> 15:30.826
Okay.

15:32.883 --> 15:34.361
But if you don't care to be
in the courtroom…

15:34.361 --> 15:36.011
I want to be there.

15:36.046 --> 15:37.512
From this point on,
that's not entirely necessary.

15:37.512 --> 15:39.181
I want to be there!

15:39.264 --> 15:42.444
I want you to get him, and I want to see
you get him!

15:43.894 --> 15:47.022
Get who, Emily?

15:47.105 --> 15:51.068
We're suing a company.

15:56.782 --> 15:58.985
So I heard Lynette's cyst didn't go away,

15:58.985 --> 16:00.452
and they're gonna have to lance it.

16:00.452 --> 16:02.162
All that and her…

16:02.245 --> 16:04.581
Hello, Denny.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.666
Do you still remember who I am?

16:06.750 --> 16:09.753
Or did I leak out your whiffle-ball brain?

16:11.755 --> 16:14.514
Now her, I know we fired.

16:14.549 --> 16:16.885
–Alan, any news of the case?
–Yes.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.220
Well, make it quick, because I'm having
lunch with Judy.

16:19.220 --> 16:22.223
–Her husband's… again.
–Well, I have good news.

16:22.307 --> 16:23.664
The grocery clerk was too busy driving

16:23.664 --> 16:25.712
around in his plush new ride to press charges,

16:25.712 --> 16:28.853
and the DA won't prosecute without a
complaining witness.

16:28.853 --> 16:29.812
What does that mean?

16:29.812 --> 16:32.661
Your case is dismissed. You're free and clear.

16:32.696 --> 16:33.444
Really?

16:34.613 --> 16:36.353
Catherine, this is good news.

16:36.738 --> 16:39.093
There are only two “get out of jail
free” cards in the game,

16:39.093 --> 16:41.642
and you've used them both up.

16:41.677 --> 16:44.658
–I did, didn't I?
–Yes, you did.

16:44.693 --> 16:47.639
Catherine, I want you to have this.

16:48.464 --> 16:50.707
$3,000?

16:51.642 --> 16:53.912
I hope you're not expecting sex for this.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.379
I am not. Consider it back pay.

16:57.176 --> 16:58.383
Thank you, Alan.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.578
We'll have dinner soon to celebrate.

17:10.271 --> 17:12.690
You want to rehire the sandwich guy?

17:12.724 --> 17:15.108
Well, it wasn't that big a deal.

17:15.144 --> 17:16.909
Not a big deal?

17:16.944 --> 17:18.863
How would you feel if he raped me?

17:18.863 --> 17:20.766
What would you do,
just sweep that under the rug?

17:20.766 --> 17:23.560
Oh, come on, Bev.
I know the guy upset you.

17:23.595 --> 17:26.415
Damn right he upset me.
He was completely rude.

17:27.109 --> 17:30.599
But, Denny, I mean,
my feelings don't matter here.

17:30.634 --> 17:34.089
The sandwich guy didn't disrespect
Beverly Bridge.

17:34.124 --> 17:38.228
He disrespected the fiancée of Denny Crane.

17:38.263 --> 17:40.685
He disrespected you.

17:42.043 --> 17:44.303
That son of a bitch.

17:57.526 --> 18:00.828
If you turn to page 56, appendix B…

18:00.863 --> 18:03.383
Uh, sorry, folks. Talked it over with Bev.

18:03.394 --> 18:06.036
The sandwich guy? Still out.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.709
Okay, we need to deal with this now.

18:13.744 --> 18:16.255
We need to deal with the sandwich guy

18:16.290 --> 18:18.248
instead of the multimillion-dollar Blake Merger?

18:18.248 --> 18:20.222
No, Bev's influence on Denny.

18:20.257 --> 18:22.523
Yeah, believe me, that's next on my agenda.

18:22.523 --> 18:24.755
Bev fired the sandwich guy. I went to Denny.

18:24.755 --> 18:27.995
He talked to Bev, and the sandwich guy
is still fired.

18:29.349 --> 18:31.705
–It's Angie all over again.
–Or Marcia.

18:31.740 --> 18:34.062
–Or Clovis.
–From what I have seen,

18:34.146 --> 18:37.774
Bev is much more formidable than any of
the previous Mrs Cranes.

18:37.774 --> 18:40.604
If she gets Denny to take
his name off the door,

18:40.604 --> 18:42.904
people will think the firm's in trouble.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.842
Clients will stampede out of here.

18:44.842 --> 18:46.950
I have an idea.

18:47.034 --> 18:49.747
I realize I haven't been partner for
very long, so let me ask you both,

18:49.747 --> 18:53.707
how much discretion would I have to make
this Bev problem go away?

18:57.335 --> 18:59.358
No chopping off fingers.

18:59.393 --> 19:01.381
No violence of any kind.

19:01.416 --> 19:05.510
None, I promise.

19:07.179 --> 19:10.402
Then you have as much
discretion as you need.

19:17.022 --> 19:18.724
And in comparison with other

19:18.759 --> 19:21.359
HMOs, Well Benefits would rank where?

19:21.394 --> 19:24.529
Several prominent publications have listed us

19:24.564 --> 19:27.504
at the top of our field in terms of
customer satisfaction.

19:27.504 --> 19:31.104
And in terms of your web site,
specifically security?

19:31.139 --> 19:34.138
It is considered user-friendly but sound.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.287
We meet the accepted business standard
for internet security.

19:37.287 --> 19:41.665
If Mr Hayden uses his criminal ingenuity
to illegally obtain information,

19:41.665 --> 19:44.983
that's horrible, but it's what he chose to do.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.825
Mr Orchard, according to my records,

19:46.825 --> 19:49.197
your company generates approximately

19:49.232 --> 19:51.116
$1.5 billion in revenues each year.

19:51.116 --> 19:52.976
–Is that right?
–Approximately.

19:53.563 --> 19:55.945
Oh, forgive me, your honor.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.928
Before I began my cross-examination,

19:57.928 --> 19:59.806
I meant to congratulate Mr Orchard.

19:59.806 --> 20:04.089
His wife recently gave birth to a
beautiful baby daughter.

20:05.380 --> 20:05.980
Thank you.

20:05.991 --> 20:10.959
8 pounds, 15 ounces. Healthy, happy?

20:10.994 --> 20:12.780
Thank goodness, yes.

20:12.815 --> 20:15.464
She was a bit jaundiced
when she came out, though,

20:15.464 --> 20:18.444
had a little fluid in her lungs which
needed to be aspirated.

20:18.444 --> 20:20.651
–Sorry?
–No, I'm sorry.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.745
I didn't mean to disregard
your other children,

20:22.745 --> 20:24.629
which so often happens with the arrival
of the new one.

20:24.629 --> 20:25.702
You have a 4-year-old and a 10-year-old.

20:25.702 --> 20:26.372
Your honor!

20:26.407 --> 20:28.810
Your honor, I just thought Mr Orchard
would like to know

20:28.810 --> 20:31.317
his 10-year-old Carly likes Max Babcock,

20:31.352 --> 20:33.528
though Max doesn't know if he likes her back.

20:33.528 --> 20:35.307
At least that's what I ascertained from
the chat room.

20:35.307 --> 20:37.268
–Objection!
–All this objecting.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.735
Mr Jovanka, you seem
in such a nasty mood.

20:39.735 --> 20:42.889
Could it be the new Lexus you ordered
online from a broker has been delayed?

20:42.889 --> 20:44.370
Gosh, I hope you're not forced to keep

20:44.370 --> 20:45.817
driving that sedan with the dent in it

20:45.817 --> 20:47.373
from your recent fender bender.

20:47.373 --> 20:48.860
–Mr Shore!
–Yes, your honor!

20:48.860 --> 20:51.297
By the way, you need to renew
your car registration,

20:51.297 --> 20:53.197
but congratulations on your colonoscopy.

20:53.197 --> 20:55.490
–Mr Shore!
–Too personal?

20:55.525 --> 20:57.855
It was just information I was able to
obtain from web sites

20:57.855 --> 21:01.811
which employ the accepted business
standard for internet security.

21:01.811 --> 21:04.691
That is what you called it,
Mr Orchard, correct?

21:04.784 --> 21:05.469
Correct.

21:05.504 --> 21:07.739
Here's what I don't understand.

21:07.774 --> 21:09.940
You're a billion-dollar company.

21:09.975 --> 21:14.226
You're in the business of ensuring the
health and well-being of your clientèle.

21:14.226 --> 21:17.159
And yet, you weren't able to ensure the
safety of their records,

21:17.159 --> 21:18.828
which you could have done had you spent

21:18.828 --> 21:21.817
just a fraction of those billions
on internet security.

21:21.817 --> 21:25.306
Mr Shore, as we all know, health care
costs have spun out of control.

21:25.306 --> 21:28.043
Information technology
is the single largest cost

21:28.043 --> 21:30.746
for us and for all other
Fortune 1000 companies.

21:30.746 --> 21:33.091
If we had upgraded to a more secure system,

21:33.091 --> 21:35.751
more people would have had
to do without health care.

21:35.751 --> 21:38.091
And yet fewer would have been murdered.

21:55.053 --> 21:56.227
Thank you.

21:56.513 --> 21:58.473
To Denny Crane.

22:05.188 --> 22:07.606
Now, Brad, did you really
ask me here on business,

22:07.606 --> 22:11.041
or are you trying to do a little move-in
on Denny Crane's girl?

22:11.041 --> 22:13.036
Just business.

22:13.071 --> 22:14.608
I'm here to talk about you and Denny.

22:14.608 --> 22:16.790
Well, we're very much in love.

22:16.825 --> 22:20.203
If anything changes, though,
I'll let you know.

22:20.238 --> 22:23.331
Well, as you know, Denny's been married
several times,

22:23.331 --> 22:24.874
and each time, it's ended in divorce.

22:24.874 --> 22:26.543
And each divorce has been traumatic

22:26.543 --> 22:29.337
and ultimately costly for Denny and
Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

22:29.337 --> 22:30.553
Don't worry about it, Brad.

22:30.553 --> 22:33.742
I'm sure I'm gonna sign any pre-nup that
Denny wants me to.

22:33.742 --> 22:35.509
This isn't about a pre-nup.

22:35.544 --> 22:39.940
This is about avoiding the turmoil of
marriage and divorce altogether.

22:41.504 --> 22:43.046
You lost me.

22:43.081 --> 22:44.926
I'll make it simple.

22:44.961 --> 22:48.193
I'm prepared to give you $500,000 right now

22:48.228 --> 22:52.861
if you walk away and never have any
contact with Denny Crane ever again.

23:00.952 --> 23:04.593
It will save us a lot of money, time and grief.

23:06.534 --> 23:08.537
But I want you to know that we will
aggressively fight

23:08.537 --> 23:12.317
to keep you from exercising any control
over Denny or the firm.

23:19.595 --> 23:22.105
I'm gonna tell you two things.

23:22.140 --> 23:25.893
First, I love Denny Crane with all my heart,

23:25.935 --> 23:29.473
and I will never leave him, not for all
the money in the world.

23:29.473 --> 23:32.031
And second…

23:32.066 --> 23:36.882
in a moment, you're going to pour your
glass of wine all over yourself.

23:57.925 --> 23:59.626
Crap!

24:10.896 --> 24:12.126
Hello.

24:13.691 --> 24:14.647
Hi.

24:15.567 --> 24:17.783
I always feel slightly sick to my stomach

24:17.783 --> 24:21.063
when I work alone in the office late at night.

24:21.984 --> 24:23.652
I thought you liked being alone.

24:23.652 --> 24:25.313
Oh, I love being alone.

24:25.348 --> 24:28.888
I just prefer to be alone when there's
other people around.

24:30.826 --> 24:33.059
So how are you doing?

24:33.996 --> 24:35.224
Fine.

24:35.754 --> 24:38.841
I have a rabbi friend with a small
gambling problem

24:38.876 --> 24:41.003
who, when he hears someone say they're fine,

24:41.003 --> 24:44.262
he always asks again until they

24:44.297 --> 24:47.522
say something other than “fine”.

24:48.969 --> 24:50.434
So…

24:52.521 --> 24:54.142
how are you doing?

24:58.235 --> 25:02.614
I'm seeing someone
who's dying of lung cancer.

25:02.649 --> 25:04.873
And while he is a very wealthy man,

25:04.908 --> 25:08.328
he can't buy his way out
of the secondary cancers

25:08.363 --> 25:10.751
that the treatment for the first cancers
are causing.

25:10.751 --> 25:12.415
And here's the kicker.

25:12.450 --> 25:14.956
He, um, Daniel…

25:14.991 --> 25:18.776
has completely shut me out of his life.

25:22.043 --> 25:26.094
So now I just wait.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.906
Denise, I don't know you very well.

25:44.941 --> 25:48.841
However, you don't strike me as the type
of woman who just waits…

25:50.321 --> 25:52.248
for anything.

26:19.649 --> 26:20.470
May I help you?

26:20.470 --> 26:23.142
I'd like to buy some earplugs, please.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.453
$2.03.

27:18.916 --> 27:20.372
Oh, I'm in trouble now.

27:20.407 --> 27:21.522
Yes.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.011
–What's with me?
–Indeed.

27:24.046 --> 27:27.800
I certainly have a lack of impulse control.

27:27.835 --> 27:31.435
I must have ADD or OCD.

27:31.470 --> 27:33.173
Or one of those other letter things.

27:33.173 --> 27:36.733
But I don't want you to think I'm not
aware of the hole we're in.

27:36.733 --> 27:37.829
I get it.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.880
That's why I want you to know

27:39.915 --> 27:41.897
I'm willing to roll up my sleeves

27:41.980 --> 27:44.942
and work with you on this.

27:45.025 --> 27:49.278
Maybe we can set up a little office
for me at the firm.

27:54.159 --> 27:59.039
I'll be back. Sir.

28:02.668 --> 28:06.046
Don't go anywhere.

28:07.297 --> 28:09.299
What in the hell were you thinking?

28:09.299 --> 28:12.006
Well, you both gave me discretion to
make her go away.

28:12.006 --> 28:13.512
But she didn't go away!

28:13.595 --> 28:15.099
So you made this insane offer,

28:15.099 --> 28:16.534
put the firm at risk for nothing?

28:16.534 --> 28:18.626
When this gets back to Denny, and it will,

28:18.626 --> 28:20.721
he is going to blow sky high.

28:20.756 --> 28:23.301
Now Bev has a chip to play against us.

28:23.336 --> 28:25.856
Bev turned down the offer that I made her.

28:25.881 --> 28:28.822
She was very offended. She, um…

28:30.054 --> 28:32.627
–Set my tie on fire.
–Oh, God!

28:32.662 --> 28:36.659
But before she tuned me down,
she hesitated.

28:38.134 --> 28:41.910
Just a little bit, but she hesitated.

28:42.641 --> 28:47.581
This is going to get ugly.

28:55.386 --> 28:57.020
How can I not testify?

28:57.055 --> 29:00.183
You said yourself I'm the emotion
in the case.

29:00.218 --> 29:02.852
I'm thinking too much emotion.

29:02.887 --> 29:04.235
I, I don't understand.

29:04.270 --> 29:05.897
Emily, I could put you on the stand,

29:05.897 --> 29:08.691
exhibit your anger and sadness for the jury,

29:08.726 --> 29:10.318
and they will be moved, but

29:10.318 --> 29:11.861
then the defense has their turn,

29:11.861 --> 29:14.357
and they'll exploit those very same emotions,

29:14.357 --> 29:17.075
taking advantage of your pain.

29:17.110 --> 29:20.578
They'll argue that your vengeance
is truly meant for your father,

29:20.578 --> 29:23.081
and you've refocused it toward Well Benefits,

29:23.081 --> 29:25.875
the deepest pockets you could find.

29:25.958 --> 29:28.541
And they'll have the jury convinced
it's a misdirected

29:28.541 --> 29:32.451
and therefore frivolous lawsuit,
and that's how we'll lose.

29:33.477 --> 29:38.888
I suspect the most difficult thing
one could ask of you is trust,

29:38.923 --> 29:43.528
but that's exactly what I'm asking
for now, Emily.

29:49.273 --> 29:51.574
Let's get in there.

29:59.283 --> 30:01.292
Mr Shore…

30:01.327 --> 30:04.246
I wish I could get you
to come to the shelter.

30:04.281 --> 30:07.916
So many of the women there
desperately need legal advice,

30:07.917 --> 30:10.955
someone who will speak to them
openly and honestly.

30:10.955 --> 30:13.339
Are they cute?

30:13.714 --> 30:15.723
You don't fool me.

30:15.758 --> 30:18.595
You're a compassionate man.

30:21.931 --> 30:24.880
We need to get back.

30:27.311 --> 30:29.459
Ned Hayden killed his wife.

30:29.494 --> 30:33.274
He's serving a life sentence without the
possibility of parole.

30:33.776 --> 30:36.820
Justice has been served.

30:36.904 --> 30:40.199
Emily Hayden's loss is immeasurable,

30:40.282 --> 30:42.076
but whatever closure she is seeking,

30:42.076 --> 30:45.669
she must find it in her soul
or through her God,

30:45.704 --> 30:49.208
not through suing Well Benefits.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.890
Well Benefits could not reasonably
foresee this killing

30:51.890 --> 30:53.572
and did nothing to encourage it.

30:53.572 --> 30:56.172
They were in compliance with all state

30:56.207 --> 31:00.293
and federal regulations
regarding internet security.

31:00.328 --> 31:02.181
If you find for the plaintiff,

31:02.216 --> 31:05.610
you are punishing my client
for playing by the rules,

31:05.645 --> 31:09.978
and you are opening
a Pandora's box of lawsuits,

31:10.062 --> 31:13.282
not just against HMOs, but against
all internet businesses.

31:13.282 --> 31:17.007
And who will ultimately
end up paying for that?

31:17.042 --> 31:20.582
You know. It's you.

31:21.607 --> 31:23.704
When I was 11 years old,

31:23.739 --> 31:26.285
there came a time when the temptation

31:26.320 --> 31:28.796
to explore the more secretive recesses

31:28.831 --> 31:32.756
of my older sister's life became more
than I could resist.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.197
I started by poking around in her room.

31:35.232 --> 31:38.568
I ended by reading her diary. In my defense,

31:38.603 --> 31:42.107
she kept it right out in the open, under
her mattress.

31:42.142 --> 31:45.611
And the little metal clasp on it was
simply no match

31:45.646 --> 31:47.986
for the paper clip and the screwdriver.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.779
I was eventually caught,

31:49.814 --> 31:54.194
prompting my sister to have a lock
installed in her door.

31:54.229 --> 31:58.575
The only consequence of the invasion
of my sister's privacy

31:58.610 --> 32:02.834
was the temporary loss
of her confidence and trust.

32:02.869 --> 32:05.464
The invasion of Jackie Hayden's privacy

32:05.499 --> 32:10.567
led to her being stabbed and left to
bleed to death in the street.

32:10.602 --> 32:14.531
Privacy and the safety and security

32:14.566 --> 32:20.441
that that word has always implied has,
with time and technology,

32:20.476 --> 32:21.770
become an illusion.

32:21.805 --> 32:23.669
The National Security Agency

32:23.704 --> 32:28.059
has access to all our e-mail the world
over with its Echelon system.

32:28.094 --> 32:30.400
Virtually every web site you visit

32:30.435 --> 32:34.106
installs a delicious cookie
onto your computer,

32:34.141 --> 32:37.743
which is in fact a spy
to track your every move.

32:37.778 --> 32:42.028
There are predators out in cyberspace
collecting data on your children

32:42.063 --> 32:44.311
while they innocently type away in chat rooms.

32:44.311 --> 32:46.850
And that little waiver you've signed in
the doctor's office

32:46.850 --> 32:50.445
most likely allows physicians to share
your information on the internet

32:50.445 --> 32:52.067
with insurance companies,

32:52.102 --> 32:54.291
the government, your employer and the courts.

32:54.291 --> 32:58.768
Make no mistake, access to your
information is easy.

32:58.803 --> 33:02.215
All you need is a person's 5-digit zip code,

33:02.250 --> 33:05.628
gender and date of birth to uniquely identify

33:05.663 --> 33:09.154
87% of the US population.

33:09.189 --> 33:13.302
That is how vulnerable we are,
how vulnerable you are.

33:13.337 --> 33:17.381
Well Benefits says they could not have
possibly foreseen

33:17.416 --> 33:22.140
the actions of an abusive spouse intent
on causing his wife harm.

33:22.175 --> 33:25.278
Let me tell you what Jackie Hayden
could not foresee,

33:25.278 --> 33:27.326
that after years of cruel and violent

33:27.326 --> 33:29.305
debasement at the hands of her husband,

33:29.305 --> 33:32.034
after she finally found her way out of
the shadows,

33:32.034 --> 33:34.728
she didn't foresee that the people
she most trusted

33:34.728 --> 33:36.151
with her health and well-being would

33:36.151 --> 33:38.308
lead the darkness right back to her door,

33:38.308 --> 33:40.079
and now she's dead.

33:41.833 --> 33:46.004
Well Benefits made it easy
for Ned Hayden to find his wife,

33:46.039 --> 33:48.549
as easy as looking under a mattress.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.302
Madame foreperson,
you've reached a verdict?

34:28.755 --> 34:31.273
We the jury find in favor of the plaintiff

34:31.273 --> 34:32.540
and award compensatory

34:32.540 --> 34:35.774
damages in the amount of $950,000

34:35.809 --> 34:39.804
and punitive damages
in the amount of $2 million.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.813
Your honor, we move for a

34:43.857 --> 34:45.400
judgment notwithstanding the verdict,

34:45.400 --> 34:47.527
or in the alternative, a new trial.

34:47.610 --> 34:50.030
Motion denied.

34:50.112 --> 34:55.034
Jury is dismissed. We are adjourned.

34:55.118 --> 34:56.745
Thank you.

34:56.828 --> 35:01.291
–Thank you, Mr Shore.
–You're welcome.

35:03.626 --> 35:06.358
I knew you could win this, Mr Shore.

35:06.393 --> 35:09.660
Well, that's usually the safe bet.

35:09.695 --> 35:12.927
Tell me, how does a striking latino

35:13.011 --> 35:16.729
woman come by the name Irma Levine?

35:16.764 --> 35:24.022
Congratulations on winning
your case. Thank you.

35:28.192 --> 35:30.743
–Great work.
–Thank you.

35:30.778 --> 35:33.823
I have to go see the DA about Catherine.

35:33.858 --> 35:36.534
Are you heading somewhere?

35:36.569 --> 35:40.169
Or just waiting?

35:40.204 --> 35:46.419
No, I'm definitely not waiting.

35:51.465 --> 35:52.807
Let her go?

35:52.842 --> 35:54.886
–What are you, high?
–Not yet.

35:54.921 --> 35:56.512
She already murdered a man.

35:56.512 --> 35:58.132
For which a jury found her innocent.

35:58.132 --> 35:59.717
And now she's on a crime spree.

35:59.717 --> 36:01.183
Twice in the same

36:01.267 --> 36:02.893
convenience store hardly makes a spree.

36:02.893 --> 36:06.355
Then what would you call her,
an active senior?

36:06.439 --> 36:08.024
No.

36:08.107 --> 36:11.246
I would call her a sad and lonely old woman,

36:11.281 --> 36:14.771
a woman who spent
many years living in solitude

36:14.806 --> 36:18.262
with nothing to occupy
her wit and intellect.

36:18.297 --> 36:20.841
Then one day, she became my assistant,

36:20.876 --> 36:22.482
and suddenly she was in an

36:22.517 --> 36:24.860
environment equal to the task of entertaining

36:24.860 --> 36:28.075
and stimulating her magnificent mind.

36:28.110 --> 36:29.697
Then she should have taken up

36:29.697 --> 36:31.557
crocheting, not felony robbery.

36:32.033 --> 36:34.008
Granted.

36:34.476 --> 36:36.295
But for Catherine, this was not about

36:36.295 --> 36:41.890
malice nor financial gain, nor thrill seeking.

36:41.925 --> 36:47.485
It was about getting my attention,
and she got it.

36:47.490 --> 36:50.783
Her reign of terror is over.

36:50.818 --> 36:52.465
I promise.

36:58.073 --> 36:59.273
She pleads guilty to

36:59.273 --> 37:01.034
misdemeanor possession of a firearm.

37:01.034 --> 37:04.166
I'll recommend probation, no jail time.

37:04.580 --> 37:06.302
Thank you, Ms Raines.

37:13.672 --> 37:16.431
–One thing.
–Yes?

37:16.466 --> 37:19.636
I do this for you,
you do something for me.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.104
I'm listening.

37:23.849 --> 37:27.394
Get me an interview
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

37:27.429 --> 37:29.514
Let's just say being a district attorney

37:29.514 --> 37:33.282
isn't entertaining and stimulating
my magnificent mind.

37:33.317 --> 37:36.021
Just get me in the door.
I'll get the job myself,

37:36.021 --> 37:38.181
and you'll get Catherine Piper back.

37:40.942 --> 37:43.281
I'll see what I can do.

37:57.215 --> 37:59.342
These are for you, dill pickles.

37:59.426 --> 38:01.410
They're supposed to alter the metallic

38:01.410 --> 38:03.796
taste sensation from the chemotherapy

38:03.831 --> 38:06.231
and make your regular food taste better.

38:06.266 --> 38:08.408
Well, that is the nicest

38:08.443 --> 38:10.550
chemo gift I've ever gotten.

38:16.025 --> 38:18.146
This may not be the best time to discuss this,

38:18.146 --> 38:23.116
but you're weak, and I'm strong.

38:23.151 --> 38:26.511
You don't get to set all the rules
in this relationship.

38:26.612 --> 38:28.245
Your whole life, you have

38:28.246 --> 38:29.622
used money to set the rules,

38:29.622 --> 38:33.501
and now you're using your illness.

38:33.536 --> 38:35.795
I think I should be able

38:35.878 --> 38:38.089
to. I… I got the bum lung.

38:38.124 --> 38:40.097
I know, I know,

38:40.132 --> 38:45.269
but it, it wasn't right

38:45.304 --> 38:48.547
for you to shut me out like that.

38:51.637 --> 38:56.614
You're right. I'm sorry.

38:56.649 --> 38:59.318
But if you hit me or anything,

38:59.353 --> 39:02.266
I might literally die.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.568
Scoot.

39:25.594 --> 39:28.514
I've been thinking a good deal
about my offer

39:28.549 --> 39:31.058
to hire you
as my personal assistant,

39:31.100 --> 39:32.545
I've come to the conclusion,

39:32.545 --> 39:36.355
Catherine, that I am a terrible boss.

39:36.390 --> 39:39.156
Oh, no, dear, I don't think so.

39:39.191 --> 39:43.320
My point is, I've found you a job,
a better job.

39:43.355 --> 39:44.301
I don't know.

39:44.336 --> 39:46.753
The pay is comparable.
It's a start-up company,

39:46.753 --> 39:50.166
and they need someone
with imagination

39:50.201 --> 39:53.580
and experience, a real people person.

39:53.615 --> 39:55.547
I immediately thought of you.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.093
Dental?

39:59.128 --> 40:02.965
I'm sure something can be worked out.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.501
So what would I be doing?

40:06.270 --> 40:09.436
Pesto chicken, veggie wraps!

40:09.471 --> 40:12.850
Roast beef on ciabatta!
Come and get it.

40:12.885 --> 40:14.643
I have fruit and hard-boiled eggs

40:14.643 --> 40:16.311
and stuff, but I've got bundt cake.

40:16.311 --> 40:19.856
Okay, what are you having there?
That's $4 for that.

40:19.891 --> 40:21.240
Thank you very much.

40:21.275 --> 40:23.645
Only a sandwich?
Don't you want something sweet?

40:23.645 --> 40:27.572
I've got sweet buns. Oh, no.

40:30.951 --> 40:34.746
So you're in the sandwich business now?

40:34.781 --> 40:36.894
A silent investor.

40:56.601 --> 40:57.776
There you are.

40:57.811 --> 41:00.355
I've hardly seen you this episode.

41:00.390 --> 41:03.233
It saddens me.

41:05.193 --> 41:06.451
Tough case?

41:06.486 --> 41:08.738
Yes, lack of privacy on the

41:08.780 --> 41:10.990
internet is complicated and…

41:11.025 --> 41:12.707
overwhelming.

41:12.742 --> 41:14.806
It doesn't scare me.

41:14.841 --> 41:16.836
My life's an open book.

41:16.871 --> 41:19.200
So you wouldn't mind if someone
tapped a few keys

41:19.200 --> 41:21.633
and discovered you have mad cow?

41:21.668 --> 41:25.094
I don't care. I tell everybody I meet anyway.

41:25.129 --> 41:26.951
Ever looked yourself up on the internet?

41:26.951 --> 41:32.762
I have. Denny Crane, legal genius.
What about you?

41:32.797 --> 41:35.605
No. I don't want to know me.

41:35.640 --> 41:41.813
Oh, I know you. You're not so bad.

41:44.357 --> 41:47.033
–So I've met this girl.
–You did?

41:47.068 --> 41:52.198
Irma Levine. She gives me a bit of trouble.

41:52.233 --> 41:54.499
Take her to my wedding.

41:54.534 --> 41:56.744
–We just met.
–Bev and I just met.

41:56.779 --> 41:58.955
We're the ones getting married.

41:58.990 --> 42:03.084
You are, aren't you?

42:04.877 --> 42:07.630
Yes, I am.
