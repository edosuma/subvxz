33:46.491 --> 33:48.258
I just want to be clear.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.527
Gabriela dawson
and sylvie brett,

33:50.562 --> 33:52.095
you've been ordered
to mandatory re-training.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.630
Next shift.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.598
Report to the fischer classroom,
third floor of the academy.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.400
8:00 a.M. Sharp.

33:57.435 --> 33:59.403
And bring a number-two pencil.

34:05.443 --> 34:06.409
- Hmm.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.845
- Re-training. Re-training?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.314
Like every day
isn't re-training already?

34:11.349 --> 34:12.482
I should be the teacher
of that class.

34:12.517 --> 34:14.451
Hell, I am the teacher.

34:14.486 --> 34:15.618
Name one thing
they're gonna say to me

34:15.653 --> 34:17.420
that I haven't seen or done
100 times.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.356
- I can't.

34:23.695 --> 34:26.463
- Look, if they want to pay me
to sit in a warm classroom

34:26.498 --> 34:29.132
instead of freezing my ass off
helping the citizens of chicago,

34:29.167 --> 34:31.334
then be my guest.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.103
- Hey, guys,

34:33.138 --> 34:35.438
can I get you to do a favor
for me?

34:35.473 --> 34:37.540
- What is it?

34:37.575 --> 34:40.110
- Who cares what it is.
It's a favor.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.711
You in or you out?
- I'm in.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.513
- Thank you. Good.

34:43.548 --> 34:44.714
- I'm gonna need
more information.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.449
- No, you're not.
- Okay. I'm in.

34:46.484 --> 34:47.751
- Yeah.

34:52.390 --> 34:54.591
So, now, listen, lee henry.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.693
You definitely have
the constitutional right

34:56.728 --> 34:58.895
not to say the pledge
of allegiance.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.663
You also have the right
to be a jackass.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.599
- [scoffs]

35:02.634 --> 35:05.735
- I'm kidding, all right?
Sort of.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.738
Hey! I don't know
if you remember my old friend

35:08.773 --> 35:10.740
eddie wright,
1st recon battalion,

35:10.775 --> 35:13.476
marine corps,
served in iraq

35:13.511 --> 35:15.512
fighting for your
constitutional rights.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.514
- Look at you now.
I haven't seen you

35:17.549 --> 35:19.449
since you were knee-high.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.518
- So, hey, eddie,
this is chief boden.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.620
- Sir, nice to meet you.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.922
- And fellow firefighter
randy mcholland.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.358
- Sir, nice to meet you.
- My pleasure, eddie.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.426
- I hope you guys are hungry.
I got us a table over here.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.595
Come on.
- All right. Thank you.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.665
Get going.

35:37.535 --> 35:40.170
- Welcome. Enjoy yourself.

35:40.205 --> 35:43.506
- Yeah. Thank you.

35:43.541 --> 35:44.741
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

35:44.776 --> 35:47.744
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you.

35:47.779 --> 35:52.415
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.551
- Thanks, everyone,
for coming down here today

35:54.586 --> 35:57.520
and chipping in
on the pancake breakfast.

35:57.555 --> 36:01.457
You know, that $5 is
the best deal in the city.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.693
[laughter]
now, if you wouldn't mind,

36:03.728 --> 36:06.696
let's all stand

36:06.731 --> 36:08.965
and remove our hats,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.768
put a hand over our hearts.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.543
[together]
I pledge allegiance to the flag

36:20.578 --> 36:23.246
of the united states of america,

36:23.281 --> 36:26.549
and to the republic
for which it stands,

36:26.584 --> 36:28.818
one nation, under god,

36:28.853 --> 36:30.420
indivisible,

36:30.455 --> 36:33.489
with liberty and justice
for all.

36:33.524 --> 36:35.758
- Now let's eat!

36:35.793 --> 36:39.229
- Let's eat.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.698
- How about that?

36:52.677 --> 36:55.578
- How is she?

36:55.613 --> 36:57.680
- Physically, she's fine.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.016
Mentally,
it's going to be a long road,

37:00.051 --> 37:02.719
and, uh, recovery always has
its hills and valleys,

37:02.754 --> 37:04.721
but I am optimistic.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.689
She moves to the rehab facility
tomorrow.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.857
- Okay. Thanks, doc.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.826
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.268
I am texting dawson right now

37:18.303 --> 37:20.637
telling her to meet us
at top golf,

37:20.672 --> 37:22.872
because the first round
of games are on me.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.875
- Ooh.
- Mm-hmm.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.044
I just said<i> I</i> was texting her.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.313
- Yeah.
I'm texting everyone else,

37:30.348 --> 37:32.882
since you're buying.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.751
- Oh.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.819
- So, the four paramedics are
hillary, john,

37:36.854 --> 37:38.755
max, and crazy joe.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.758
Each one of them bets me that I
can't streak down a hallway,

37:41.793 --> 37:43.526
jump five feet
over a bunch of tacks

37:43.561 --> 37:44.761
that they'd laid down
on the floor,

37:44.796 --> 37:46.763
grab the fire pole, slide down,

37:46.798 --> 37:48.631
and do it all
in my tighty-whities.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.767
So, crazy joe--
I say to him, "listen,

37:50.802 --> 37:52.669
there's no time like the
present--let's do this."

37:52.704 --> 37:54.871
so I get to the end of the
hallway, off comes the shirt,

37:54.906 --> 37:57.774
off come the pants, and--
oh, there she is.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.676
This must be the lucky lady.

37:59.711 --> 38:00.910
- Hi.
- I'm benny.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.979
- Hi.
- Hi!

38:04.682 --> 38:05.715
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.550
- Course she's all right.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.686
This is the best steakhouse
in chicago, isn't it?

38:09.721 --> 38:11.721
Hey, george, do me a favor and
get this young lady a cocktail.

38:11.756 --> 38:13.890
- No--just a water, please.
- Okay, in that case,

38:13.925 --> 38:15.892
I'll have the cocktail,
and trish will have another--

38:15.927 --> 38:18.361
whatever these umbrella things
are.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.697
- [giggles] thanks.
- Thank you.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.932
Anna, this is trish,
and trish this is anna.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.668
She's my son's main squeeze.
Or so I'm told.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.870
- It's really nice to meet you.
- You too.

38:27.905 --> 38:30.940
- How was your shift?
- It was fine.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.676
- Anna's a pediatric nurse
at chicago med.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.111
- Is that, like, a foot doctor?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.714
- No. That's a podiatric.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.549
- She works with children.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.784
Many in the oncology--
cancer unit.

38:41.819 --> 38:42.952
- Oh, great. That's cool.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.954
- And I work
with the big children.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.790
- Yes. Big and old.
[both laugh]

38:47.825 --> 38:50.660
I cop to that.
[trish laughing]

38:51.996 --> 38:55.365
oh, bone-in steak girl.
That's a good sign.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.134
That looks good.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.737
- Actually, I, um--

39:00.772 --> 39:02.772
I have to go.
- What?

39:02.807 --> 39:04.574

to meet you.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.976
Um, enjoy your dinner.
