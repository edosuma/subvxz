WEBVTT

00:50.150 --> 00:51.151
Good job.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.919
It's a great song.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.990
But do you think you can beat
the idol team with this?

00:58.525 --> 01:01.895
They'll be delivering
a splendid performance.

01:01.961 --> 01:03.563
We are B-grade...

01:04.397 --> 01:06.533
I don't know.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.935
Won't the performances
be graded by peer voting?

01:12.939 --> 01:17.544
Why don't you add
some choreography to your routine?

01:18.378 --> 01:19.312
Choreography?

01:20.213 --> 01:21.047
But we can't dance.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.349
You think dancing is hard,

01:23.416 --> 01:24.984
but even your English teacher here
can dance.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.087
Anybody can dance.

01:28.121 --> 01:31.558
Hong-ju, how would you
express the letter B?

01:38.932 --> 01:40.433
Maybe not anybody.

01:40.967 --> 01:41.801
Hae-seong.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.170
What about you?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.712
Sun-dong, how about A?

01:57.350 --> 01:58.885
And B-grade?

02:05.658 --> 02:07.961
How about you?
Express the part about being the best.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.134
-That's your choreography.
-What?

02:14.767 --> 02:15.668
You can do it!

02:16.436 --> 02:18.972
I do nothing important

02:19.038 --> 02:22.108
Everything seems pointless

02:22.175 --> 02:24.978
I work up a sweat

02:25.044 --> 02:28.314
For nothing

02:28.448 --> 02:30.884
I'm frustrated as can be

02:30.950 --> 02:33.887
But even more frustrating to others

02:33.953 --> 02:36.856
Seeing the looks on their faces

02:36.923 --> 02:39.759
Wears me out even more

02:39.826 --> 02:43.129
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

02:43.196 --> 02:45.431
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

02:45.665 --> 02:48.968
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

02:49.035 --> 02:51.237
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

02:51.304 --> 02:53.039
-One day
-One day

02:53.106 --> 02:59.078
-I hope to find that inner spark
-I hope to find that inner spark

02:59.145 --> 03:00.747
-One day
-One day

03:00.813 --> 03:03.249
-I hope to shine as I am meant to
-I hope to shine as I am meant to

03:03.316 --> 03:07.654
-Will that day come
-Will that day come

03:08.054 --> 03:10.623
-Before I lose the fading light
-Before I lose the fading light

03:10.990 --> 03:14.894
-Of my dream?
-Of my dream?

03:15.295 --> 03:18.731
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

03:18.798 --> 03:20.900
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

03:21.267 --> 03:24.571
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

03:24.637 --> 03:26.906
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

03:27.106 --> 03:30.577
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

03:30.643 --> 03:32.745
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

03:33.079 --> 03:36.416
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

03:36.482 --> 03:38.818
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

04:44.817 --> 04:48.421
You'll really damage your throat.
Let's go and see a doctor.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.557
It's just a cold.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.561
Will you be able to perform?

04:58.097 --> 04:58.965
You're so stubborn.

05:00.099 --> 05:02.068
We're going to the doctor
right after the show, okay?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.044
I'm impressed, Ms. Ahn.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.681
It was nothing. How about your kids?

05:15.715 --> 05:17.216
You're in for a spectacle.

05:17.950 --> 05:22.555
You'll be able to see the difference
between amateurs and pros.

05:36.169 --> 05:41.441
When the rain falls,
You always come to my mind

05:41.574 --> 05:46.546
The memory of you tortures me
Through the night

05:46.813 --> 05:50.016
When the rain gets lighter

05:50.149 --> 05:56.689
The memory of you will slowly fade away

06:01.761 --> 06:03.730
I LOVE YOU HERSHE

06:14.374 --> 06:18.444
Who will wipe all my tears away?

06:18.644 --> 06:21.681
The hot tears running down my face

06:22.615 --> 06:26.452
Among all those people passing by

06:26.552 --> 06:29.689
Who will stay by my side?

06:30.590 --> 06:33.626
Standing on the street in the rain

06:34.460 --> 06:37.530
I am thinking of you

06:38.598 --> 06:41.267
I am reminded of our star-crossed love

06:41.467 --> 06:45.705
That I had kept deep in my heart

06:57.850 --> 07:01.788
When my love rains down your my head

07:01.921 --> 07:06.259
You will be reminded of the memory
We shared

07:06.459 --> 07:09.629
When my love rains down on your heart

07:09.695 --> 07:13.166
You will be reminded of the precious love
We had for each other

07:13.232 --> 07:16.969
When my love touches your lips

07:17.036 --> 07:21.407
You will shout out "I love you"

07:21.574 --> 07:27.747
Walking down the rainy street

07:27.814 --> 07:29.882
You will see me waiting for you

07:29.949 --> 07:33.719
I want to go back in time

07:33.786 --> 07:37.523
I prayed to go back to that one moment

07:37.723 --> 07:43.029
If I cry out like this

07:43.362 --> 07:48.201
The rain of love will come down

08:14.227 --> 08:18.531
When your love rains down on my eyes

08:18.698 --> 08:23.069
I can see you standing
Right in front of me

08:23.236 --> 08:26.606
-When your love rains down on my ears
-How can Na-na make a mistake like that?

08:26.672 --> 08:30.142
-I can hear you whispering love to me
-It wasn't a mistake.

08:30.209 --> 08:34.013
-When I hold you, my love, in my arms
-Something's wrong with her.

08:34.180 --> 08:38.417
I can be happy again

08:38.484 --> 08:42.655
Following the road where the sun shines on

08:42.722 --> 08:46.959
Once we walk down, we will see us together
As we have wanted

09:02.308 --> 09:06.012
Did you witness a miracle today?

09:12.818 --> 09:15.821
The theme of today's mission was "bi."

09:17.623 --> 09:21.294
With any team mission,
the key is teamwork.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.665
To present a cohesive team performance,

09:26.365 --> 09:28.734
the less competent members
should try harder, right?

09:30.102 --> 09:33.906
And the more competent members
shouldn't try to show off.

09:34.473 --> 09:35.808
That's what teamwork is.

09:37.143 --> 09:41.013
A team should be a cohesive unit,
without any member standing out.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.584
Unexpected contingencies
may arise on stage.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.021
While the two teams here
delivered their performances

09:49.622 --> 09:51.524
on the theme "bi,"

09:51.724 --> 09:55.595
what I was looking for was "B,"
as in "plan B."

10:01.867 --> 10:02.802
Shin Hae-seong.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.008
She made a mistake on stage.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.949
But thanks to her teammates,
the audience did not notice.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.920
That was the plan B I was looking for.

10:22.421 --> 10:25.358
A professional team can react quickly

10:25.424 --> 10:29.895
and deal with any mistakes
or issues that arise on stage.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.770
I don't know how he managed to catch that.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.639
No wonder he's the best of the best.

10:40.106 --> 10:43.075
An unexpected mistake was made
during the second performance as well.

10:44.610 --> 10:47.446
The professional team,
consisting of HershE and I:dn members,

10:48.381 --> 10:50.449
however, couldn't react quickly
and cover up the mistake.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.386
Why weren't they able to do so?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.725
It was arrogance.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.462
Despite the terrible condition
of her throat,

11:04.163 --> 11:06.966
she arrogantly took the stage
and tried to trick the audience.

11:08.300 --> 11:12.371
That excessive confidence
led to a critical mistake.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.942
In any case,
the final decision is up to you all.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.715
The winner of the first round
of the Super Idol Audition

11:23.249 --> 11:25.251
will be announced...

11:27.119 --> 11:28.688
after we count all your votes.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.832
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

11:41.434 --> 11:44.370
-Thank you, Ms. Ahn.
-Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

11:45.504 --> 11:49.709
You guys did a great job.

11:49.942 --> 11:52.845
I still can't believe
you guys won first place.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.780
I'm so proud of my babies.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.615
-Ms. Ahn.
-Yes?

11:56.982 --> 12:01.087
Shouldn't we celebrate
at a fancy restaurant?

12:01.520 --> 12:04.857
I figured a home-cooked meal would be
better since you hardly get to eat them.

12:07.126 --> 12:10.062
Without you all, none of this
would have been possible.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.632
Thank you for making
my first stage performance so special.

12:16.669 --> 12:20.606
You don't need to thank us.
I am a super idol, after all.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.241
As long as I'm on the team,

12:22.975 --> 12:25.077
we'll always...

12:26.278 --> 12:27.113
be first place.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.048
Whatever you say.

12:41.627 --> 12:42.495
What are you doing here?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.266
You must be here to kneel.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.267
What?

12:50.669 --> 12:52.104
We had made a bet.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.442
Whoever loses the audition
has to get down on his knees.

12:58.310 --> 13:03.182
You didn't have to come here
to do it, but if you insist, go ahead.

13:03.749 --> 13:05.584
Korea's top star JB,

13:07.219 --> 13:08.053
go ahead and kneel.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.124
Come on, kneel.

13:13.659 --> 13:14.493
Get down on your knees.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.863
Kneel down. Come on.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.035
Why are you here
if you're not going to kneel down?

13:23.469 --> 13:24.637
-Kneel.
-No way.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.072
That little...

13:30.576 --> 13:34.246
-I asked him to come eat with us.
-Oh, that's great.

13:36.015 --> 13:39.952
Why would you invite him here
when there isn't enough to go around?

13:46.525 --> 13:49.395
Well, what does it taste like?
Is it the true taste of defeat?

13:50.563 --> 13:51.697
How does it feel to lose?

13:52.598 --> 13:55.201
You were so sure of yourself,
saying I would be down on my knees.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.406
Hae-seong won,
and that's all that matters to me.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.113
Are you two dating?

14:13.953 --> 14:15.187
No.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.293
She says she's not with you.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.796
Is it just a one-sided crush?

14:25.431 --> 14:28.934
Ms. Ahn, this is really delicious.
It's amazing.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.369
Right?

14:34.907 --> 14:36.842
Why aren't you eating?

14:39.378 --> 14:41.847
I have never seen you like this.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.250
I don't have an appetite.

14:53.325 --> 14:54.960
You have heard about
vocal cord nodules, right?

14:55.427 --> 14:59.331
Your case is more serious.
You have vocal cord cysts.

15:00.232 --> 15:04.436
Surgery is the most effective,
but there can be side effects.

15:04.703 --> 15:07.773
Your voice may change.
Your vocal range may even decrease.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.683
APPLICATION FOR WITHDRAWAL
NAME: KIM NA-NA

15:23.188 --> 15:24.623
You said it was only the flu.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.327
You can rest a few days.
Why drop out of school?

15:30.496 --> 15:31.630
What's the reason?

15:35.067 --> 15:36.502
Is it because of what happened yesterday?

15:38.170 --> 15:41.407
Anyone can mess up.
Make up for it next time.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.776
I thought this through.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.045
I'm dropping out.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.080
I didn't know you were a quitter.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.651
Give me a more convincing reason.

15:54.753 --> 15:55.788
You won't tell me?

16:01.560 --> 16:05.397
Rest in the hospital for a week.
You need the rest.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.367
You should get your throat
in tip-top shape again.

16:36.628 --> 16:37.730
Where are the others?

16:37.930 --> 16:40.332
Na-na packed up and left for the hospital.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.935
Ailee went with her.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.572
Don't dwell on yesterday.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.841
It was just an accident.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.043
There are more chances.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.078
-If you just--
-If it really was an accident,

16:54.613 --> 16:56.248
why is Na-na held accountable?

16:56.348 --> 16:57.783
That's the rule.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.286
Why are you hospitalizing
a perfectly healthy person?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.123
Is this part of Oz's process
of kicking its singers out?

17:05.157 --> 17:07.159
There was Rian, and now Na-na...

17:10.529 --> 17:12.598
-Stop it.
-Why?

17:15.501 --> 17:18.537
I guess it's an opportunity for you.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.305
What do you mean?

17:20.639 --> 17:23.542
Na-na had the best voice and vocal range,
but now that she's gone,

17:24.576 --> 17:28.614
you're in a better position to win
a spot in the super idol group.

17:28.981 --> 17:29.982
You're not making any sense.

17:31.483 --> 17:32.451
We're one team.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.452
One team?

17:34.486 --> 17:37.222
Aren't you the same person
who wanted to go solo?

17:39.124 --> 17:40.426
Thanks for the reminder.

17:52.204 --> 17:56.241
Studies show that the more famous
and consistently popular a star is,

17:56.408 --> 18:00.746
the more similarity there is
between the persona they pursue

18:00.846 --> 18:03.449
and what the public wants from them.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.223
That's why today,

18:11.323 --> 18:14.793
I would like you to draw
your self-portraits.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.562
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.001
JB, why are you here?

18:23.802 --> 18:27.606
-To take this class.
-What about your class?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.709
Everyone else is absent today.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.012
Really? Great.

18:34.079 --> 18:38.083
We'll be able to see
how similar JB's portrait is

18:38.150 --> 18:40.619
to what the public thinks of him.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.823
There are spare easels back there.
I look forward to your self-portrait.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.269
Do you want to use this
to draw your portrait?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.305
I'm fine.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.477
May I have your mirror?

19:11.083 --> 19:13.952
I'll hold it for you,
so that you can draw comfortably.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.357
I'm fine. I'll hold it for you.
You need to work on yours too.

19:18.590 --> 19:22.327
It's okay. You draw first.
I'll be waiting.

19:22.427 --> 19:25.397
-It's okay.
-Come on. You go ahead.

19:30.802 --> 19:34.006
JB, have you come back to kneel before me?

19:35.741 --> 19:36.742
That again?

19:37.609 --> 19:39.611
Be a man and keep your word.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.492
-Hey!
-That's right.

19:53.625 --> 19:57.396
Now I'm getting through to you.
This is a good start.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.331
Kneel.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.107
What? Are you embarrassed?

20:10.409 --> 20:11.944
Should we go outside
and do this in private?

20:18.984 --> 20:20.185
-Kneel.
-Let go.

20:22.187 --> 20:23.722
I told you to kneel.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.058
-Where are you going?
-Let go of me.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.988
Good grief. I told you
not to stick your face so close.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.657
What are you looking at?

21:34.192 --> 21:37.262
Mr. Yang, that kid over there...

21:37.329 --> 21:39.431
-Yu-jin?
-No. In front of him.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.969
-JB?
-Yes. JB.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.171
Don't you think JB likes Hae-seong?

21:47.272 --> 21:48.740
No way.

21:49.775 --> 21:53.011
Why not? It's obvious he likes her.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.548
Hae-seong may like him,
but not vice versa.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.717
JB is a teen idol.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.853
Can't a teen idol have a crush?

22:05.691 --> 22:08.894
Hae-seong is a nice girl.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.763
-She is.
-But she's not so feminine.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.865
-No.
-And she's...

22:17.569 --> 22:19.137
-She's a bit too tough.
-True.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.874
She's not awful, but she's plain.

22:23.542 --> 22:26.411
She's way too plain.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.847
She could do better
by losing some of her plainness.

22:30.115 --> 22:33.118
This is why I know
you still have a long way to go.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.886
Think about it.

22:34.953 --> 22:37.155
For a teen idol, what's special?

22:37.689 --> 22:41.460
Being model-perfect? Being gorgeous? No.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.694
Right.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.931
They see girls like those
in Girls' Generation every day...

22:45.997 --> 22:47.132
That's right.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.667
Girls like Hae-seong could be intriguing.

22:48.734 --> 22:52.003
-That's right.
-How did you know that?

22:52.537 --> 22:56.975
From experience. Come on.
I used to be a star myself.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.643
Right. Galaxy!

22:59.945 --> 23:02.881
So, your wife must be very plain as well.

23:06.351 --> 23:07.452
I don't want to talk about her.

23:08.453 --> 23:09.988
She's way too plain.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.392
Mr. Ju, what's that?

23:14.459 --> 23:16.228
Oh, right.

23:16.762 --> 23:21.666
As of today, my job title
is school counselor. Does it suit me?

23:21.867 --> 23:23.301
Oh, yes...

23:23.835 --> 23:27.005
If there's anything you want
to talk about, come to me.

23:30.008 --> 23:31.143
-I will.
-Bye.

23:34.913 --> 23:35.947
Mr. Lee,

23:36.915 --> 23:38.350
please reconsider.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.051
The decision has been made.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.989
If you give me time, I'll persuade Na-na.

23:44.122 --> 23:46.258
Rian is babied by her mother,

23:46.892 --> 23:49.628
while Na-na is babied by you.

23:50.662 --> 23:54.666
Don't fool yourself. You're not a teacher
just because you're at this school.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.136
Please, if you can give me
some time, I'll--

23:58.203 --> 24:00.238
The problem with HershE
is a fundamental one.

24:00.839 --> 24:03.074
Na-na's throat and Rian's attitude
are irreparable problems.

24:04.376 --> 24:08.046
Even when the TV ban is lifted,
HershE won't be able to function.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.215
I'll be held accountable if--

24:10.282 --> 24:12.217
This isn't something
you should be held accountable for.

24:12.884 --> 24:15.153
They are old enough to take
responsibility for their own lives.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.290
You can't always be there
to take care of them.

24:44.249 --> 24:46.084
FROM SI-U

24:46.218 --> 24:47.652
Na-na is hospitalized for a cold.

24:48.253 --> 24:50.121
She's in room 702
of the same hospital that you're in.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.296
PATIENT NAME, KIM NA-NA

25:08.807 --> 25:12.143
Si-u said you were here.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.851
The tests will start in ten minutes.
Please come to the seventh floor.

25:25.490 --> 25:26.558
What tests?

25:27.792 --> 25:30.562
Si-u said that you had a cold.

25:31.830 --> 25:35.166
Since she has time,
she decided to get a checkup.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.478
I saw yesterday's performance.

25:48.613 --> 25:49.848
It's just a cold, right?

25:51.349 --> 25:52.784
Your throat's okay, right?

25:57.022 --> 25:57.856
Fine.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.128
You guys didn't bother to come see me

26:03.862 --> 26:05.764
even though you were
in the same hospital as me.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.400
I'll do the same to you.

26:18.677 --> 26:19.644
What's up with her?

26:27.986 --> 26:30.088
A star?

26:31.890 --> 26:34.259
This is what a star is.

26:43.568 --> 26:47.472
Hey, that's the wrong genre.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.841
Romance comics don't suit you.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.378
Stick with the violent action thriller.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.717
You're drawing the wrong species.

26:59.084 --> 27:00.418
How so?

27:01.419 --> 27:03.188
You're not some beastly idol.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.725
You're a bug.

27:07.692 --> 27:10.295
What did you say?

27:10.528 --> 27:13.298
I LOVE YOU, HONG-JU

27:15.667 --> 27:17.335
His condition is serious.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.305
He thinks about Na-na round the clock.

27:24.542 --> 27:25.543
It's a girl.

27:26.344 --> 27:28.213
Don't tell me that's you.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.348
Is that Rian?

27:31.282 --> 27:32.717
-It's Hae-seong.
-What?

27:33.051 --> 27:35.253
Give me a break. That's Hae-seong?

27:36.087 --> 27:38.790
Hae-seong is like a pufferfish,
not some svelte model.

27:39.858 --> 27:43.495
You may be blinded by love,
but this is way too much.

27:43.695 --> 27:44.596
Seriously.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.799
You should have said it was Rian.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.701
Next up, Shin Hae-seong.

27:53.271 --> 27:57.042
I'm not done yet.

28:05.383 --> 28:07.786
Have a warm cup of tea.

28:09.387 --> 28:12.857
So, do I look like a counselor?

28:13.224 --> 28:15.727
Are you even certified?

28:15.994 --> 28:17.729
Do you want a beating from the counselor?

28:18.563 --> 28:20.098
Stop being a smart aleck.

28:20.665 --> 28:25.336
Now, Jin Yu-jin, please tell me
what you would like to discuss with me.

28:25.403 --> 28:26.471
Go ahead.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.141
-I...
-Yes?

28:30.775 --> 28:32.010
I'm doing well, right?

28:33.745 --> 28:34.646
With what?

28:35.180 --> 28:36.347
The whole super idol thing.

28:37.682 --> 28:38.917
That's a good thing, right?

28:40.418 --> 28:42.120
I've been meaning to ask you...

28:43.054 --> 28:45.290
Why are you doing it?

28:46.057 --> 28:47.425
You said you didn't want to be an idol.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.060
You wanted to do your music.

28:49.160 --> 28:53.498
That's what I'm not certain about.
The kind of music that I want to do.

28:53.631 --> 28:56.101
What do you mean? Rock. Rock spirit!

28:56.601 --> 28:59.104
Have you changed your mind?

28:59.404 --> 29:02.340
-No, but...
-But?

29:03.208 --> 29:04.476
I really want to win.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.846
There is someone I really want to beat.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.416
Really?

29:15.353 --> 29:19.390
Do you know what a pacemaker does?

29:20.658 --> 29:22.494
Why are you suddenly
talking about a marathon?

29:22.827 --> 29:25.096
-So, you know.
-Of course I do.

29:25.463 --> 29:26.297
Okay.

29:27.365 --> 29:29.400
This is only hypothetical,
so don't take it too seriously.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.338
Suppose you had to be a pacemaker.
What would you do?

29:35.039 --> 29:36.674
Why would I be a pacemaker?

29:39.010 --> 29:41.980
If I entered a marathon,
I would be in it to win first place.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.549
Why help someone else win?

29:45.483 --> 29:47.218
I would go for first place,
no matter what.

29:49.854 --> 29:50.688
Okay.

29:51.890 --> 29:54.526
That's how it should be, right?

29:55.460 --> 29:58.663
You'll make a great super idol.
Yes. You will...

30:03.201 --> 30:04.369
Anything else?

31:18.243 --> 31:20.011
I think I look better than this.

31:22.647 --> 31:23.481
Give that back.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.351
-You need to pay up.
-For what?

31:27.418 --> 31:28.686
I'm a celebrity.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.788
Haven't you heard of personality rights?

31:31.556 --> 31:32.757
You should pay up for it.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.728
-Give that back.
-I need to be paid.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.863
You can't just peek
inside my sketchbook like that.

31:38.963 --> 31:42.600
-Give it back to me.
-You have to settle your bill.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.298
I'll take this as payment.

32:14.399 --> 32:15.333
All right.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.177
I hereby announce the next mission.

32:27.645 --> 32:31.482
The winner of this mission can snag
the most advantageous spot

32:31.816 --> 32:33.685
in the performance order
for the next showcase.

32:34.585 --> 32:36.054
It's simple.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.324
There is no set theme or format.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.992
Each team will create a video

32:41.759 --> 32:44.896
and upload it on the Internet
within 12 hours.

32:45.897 --> 32:49.767
Then 12 hours later, that is,
24 hours from now,

32:50.268 --> 32:52.236
the video with the most views
will be the winner.

32:53.671 --> 32:56.107
The Internet is a new,
star-making platform.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.443
How well you understand
and use this type of medium

32:58.743 --> 33:01.012
is the key to this mission.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.315
The mission begins now.

33:10.121 --> 33:11.255
Game over.

33:13.591 --> 33:14.859
They're teen idols.

33:16.427 --> 33:17.261
So?

33:18.196 --> 33:19.263
Are you an idiot?

33:20.298 --> 33:24.102
They would win if they just uploaded
a teaser for their music video.

33:32.977 --> 33:33.911
No, they won't.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.382
He's all alone.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.371
Why are you here?

34:34.605 --> 34:35.673
And you?

34:35.973 --> 34:38.476
I came by to visit Na-na.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.711
You must be doing that too.

34:43.648 --> 34:44.482
A teddy bear...

34:46.150 --> 34:48.186
-Hey, you.
-Yes?

34:49.187 --> 34:51.522
Don't tell anyone at school
you saw me with a teddy bear.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.458
Okay.

34:56.294 --> 34:58.096
This is so not my style.

34:58.362 --> 35:02.266
Na-na had wanted to go to the zoo,
so I thought it would cheer her up.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.771
Na-na likes going to the zoo?

35:07.605 --> 35:08.473
I love zoos too.

35:08.673 --> 35:09.507
Okay.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.743
You got her a stuffed animal too?

35:46.477 --> 35:49.981
No. A fan of hers dropped it off earlier.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.383
I should get going.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.252
Why? Wait until Na-na gets back.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.120
No. I have to run.

36:00.791 --> 36:04.428
I was going to let it go
because I got her a stuffed animal too.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.131
Is it that embarrassing?

36:19.510 --> 36:23.014
The person you've dialed can't be reached.
Please leave a voice message.

36:25.316 --> 36:26.150
See?

36:27.752 --> 36:28.920
I can't get in touch with anyone.

36:30.421 --> 36:32.356
Since I'm all alone,

36:32.957 --> 36:35.993
why don't I help you first,
and then you can help me?

36:36.727 --> 36:38.062
There is no helping.

36:38.896 --> 36:40.164
You're our competitor.

36:40.665 --> 36:43.868
I'm asking you for your help,
so that it's a fair competition.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.138
Just lend me Hae-seong later.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.876
I need someone to film me.

36:53.077 --> 36:53.911
Me?

36:56.414 --> 36:57.481
Not Hae-seong.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.319
Then you can help me.

37:01.986 --> 37:02.954
Whatever.

37:03.621 --> 37:04.989
Why don't you film it yourself?

37:06.190 --> 37:07.925
Idols like you do that a lot, don't you?

37:09.093 --> 37:10.628
Hey, kids. Take a look at this.

37:14.465 --> 37:17.101
There are a few tricks in order
to raise the number of views.

37:17.168 --> 37:20.137
First, since the views
will be counted for 24 hours,

37:20.204 --> 37:21.739
the sooner we upload the video,
the better.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.010
Does anyone have footage
of last night's performance?

37:26.944 --> 37:28.946
Why don't we just put that up for now?

37:29.814 --> 37:30.881
You should think it through.

37:31.515 --> 37:33.251
It's one video per team.

37:33.784 --> 37:36.287
If you put that up
and have a better idea later,

37:36.854 --> 37:37.788
you might regret it.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.926
Why are you still here? Go away already.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.663
There must be a hidden meaning
to this mission, like the previous one.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.166
Why an Internet video? Think carefully.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.971
A video gets many views
if people find it interesting

37:54.071 --> 37:56.474
and can relate to it.

37:57.842 --> 38:01.412
Shouldn't we make something
that people like and relate to?

38:02.413 --> 38:06.784
That's right. I checked out
the most popular videos,

38:06.951 --> 38:12.657
and while their themes and formats vary,
they have two things in common.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.293
What are they?

38:16.460 --> 38:17.461
One, they're funny.

38:18.796 --> 38:19.864
Two, they're moving.

38:20.598 --> 38:23.167
So, they either make people laugh or cry?

38:25.069 --> 38:26.070
That's right.

38:44.855 --> 38:45.823
What the...

38:46.357 --> 38:47.858
Let's take it for a spin!

38:49.026 --> 38:51.362
I'm bored.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.197
I'm actually not that bad at it.

38:54.965 --> 38:57.234
-...three, four. One...
-...three, four. One...

38:57.501 --> 38:59.303
-Give that to me.
-No!

39:06.177 --> 39:08.312
Hong-ju, the next mission was announced.

39:08.779 --> 39:09.613
Okay.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.115
"Okay"?

39:11.449 --> 39:12.717
That's it?

39:16.587 --> 39:17.822
What's wrong with him?

39:18.889 --> 39:20.124
I'm not sure.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.394
-I think it's about Na-na.
-Na-na?

39:24.395 --> 39:27.164
He has a mad crush on her.

39:30.868 --> 39:31.702
On Na-na?

39:32.937 --> 39:37.274
So, he must have gone
to the hospital to visit her.

39:39.944 --> 39:41.379
Delivery.

39:43.914 --> 39:44.749
Food!

39:45.449 --> 39:48.953
-Is this for us?
-Who ordered this for us?

39:54.925 --> 39:56.594
Did you get this?

39:58.963 --> 40:02.967
Maybe it was worth
letting you join us after all.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.003
Thanks.

40:07.371 --> 40:08.773
Enjoy.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.194
Is Na-na okay?

40:31.228 --> 40:32.296
I didn't get to see her.

40:33.697 --> 40:34.965
Weren't you at the hospital?

40:35.666 --> 40:38.936
Yes, but I didn't see her.

40:40.671 --> 40:42.173
Then go back.

40:42.773 --> 40:43.674
No.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.311
What's the point in going?

40:48.245 --> 40:49.613
There's nothing I can do for her.

41:02.159 --> 41:02.993
Let's go.

41:04.261 --> 41:05.329
Let's visit Na-na.

41:18.709 --> 41:19.777
NA-NA

41:24.281 --> 41:26.417
NA-NA

42:01.085 --> 42:02.686
I want you to get better soon,

42:03.787 --> 42:05.389
so we can go to the zoo together.

42:07.691 --> 42:08.559
And...

42:16.000 --> 42:21.105
Even though I want to buy you
A pretty necklace

42:23.741 --> 42:28.679
Even though I want to take you out
On a ride in a nice car

42:31.382 --> 42:36.153
Even though I want to dress you
In nice clothes

42:36.453 --> 42:38.422
Even though

42:38.756 --> 42:43.894
I want to take you to nice places

42:46.363 --> 42:49.466
I put my hands in my pocket

42:50.100 --> 42:53.103
And finds nothing

42:54.038 --> 42:59.243
How can I make you stay by my side?

43:01.545 --> 43:04.848
I know well

43:05.516 --> 43:08.485
That you deserve better

43:09.153 --> 43:14.892
But could you still stay by my side?

43:15.292 --> 43:21.865
The only thing I can give you is this song

43:22.967 --> 43:29.540
All I have is this voice

43:31.508 --> 43:33.611
I don't know

43:34.144 --> 43:39.183
If this would make you smile

43:39.516 --> 43:42.519
But I would like to sing you this song

43:43.320 --> 43:49.093
I hope you could accept my love

44:05.743 --> 44:07.311
REPORTER PARK

44:13.817 --> 44:16.587
HERSHE BREAKUP! DISCORD AMONG THE GIRLS?

44:16.654 --> 44:17.788
RIAN'S DESERTION CAUSED BREAKUP?

44:28.365 --> 44:31.135
HERSHE BREAKS UP! HERSHE DISBANDS!
DISCORD AMONG THE GIRLS?

44:39.643 --> 44:41.979
You're very amusing,

44:42.446 --> 44:46.283
but something even more
amusing will happen soon.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.653
When it does, you'll come back to me.

44:54.992 --> 44:55.993
It's over.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.562
It's all over.

45:06.770 --> 45:08.405
Where are you going?

45:18.449 --> 45:21.819
She's such a great singer. It's a pity
that she has vocal cord nodules.

45:22.286 --> 45:24.021
That's probably why
HershE broke up, right?

45:24.855 --> 45:25.956
Mom's the word.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.926
We'll get in trouble for leaking
a patient's medical records.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.395
What are you talking about?

45:34.865 --> 45:36.266
Who has vocal cord nodules?

45:38.202 --> 45:39.036
Who is it?

46:01.792 --> 46:04.995
You broke up HershE
for that super idol group, didn't you?

46:07.631 --> 46:10.000
So that they can make
a comeback as super idols.

46:10.901 --> 46:12.736
Have you heard of pilot fish?

46:14.471 --> 46:16.507
They're used to purify contaminated water,

46:17.074 --> 46:19.743
so an aquarium is clean enough
for expensive tropical fish.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.981
Are you saying
that HershE was a pilot fish?

46:24.281 --> 46:25.783
Their sacrifice was necessary.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.752
-But they were forced into--
-Would "cull" be a better word?

46:30.053 --> 46:31.989
My vocabulary is limited.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.459
But there's one thing I know.

46:37.761 --> 46:42.266
It's manners to step down
once you've finished doing your part.

46:43.867 --> 46:45.669
Please reconsider.

46:59.583 --> 47:03.220
And it's not vocal cord nodules.
She has vocal cord cysts.

47:08.358 --> 47:09.193
What?

47:09.960 --> 47:11.895
Does this remind you
of when Cream Puff disbanded?

47:14.331 --> 47:15.966
The kids' futures ride on your decision.

47:17.067 --> 47:21.271
It wasn't my decision to make you
the sole survivor of Cream Puff.

47:22.272 --> 47:23.707
You survived yourself.

47:30.314 --> 47:32.983
Why are you hospitalizing
a perfectly healthy person?

47:34.184 --> 47:36.119
Is this part of Oz's process
of kicking its singers out?

47:36.587 --> 47:38.455
There's Rian, and now Na-na...

47:44.261 --> 47:46.597
-You should have heard him sing.
-He was good.

47:46.663 --> 47:48.832
-He was awesome, I'm not kidding you.
-Really?

47:48.899 --> 47:51.835
-He was awesome.
-Hong-ju, show us what you did.

47:51.902 --> 47:54.805
-Really? He did a good job?
-He was out of this world.

47:54.872 --> 47:57.307
-There's no guy like him on this earth.
-You're being serious?

47:57.574 --> 47:58.942
-I knew it.
-Show us.

47:59.009 --> 48:00.944
-His guitar playing was the best.
-I know, right?

48:01.011 --> 48:04.514
-Show us.
-How was Na-na doing?

48:05.616 --> 48:06.950
She said she wanted to be alone.

48:08.151 --> 48:11.455
By the way, why did HershE
break up all of a sudden?

48:11.588 --> 48:13.824
Their TV ban was going to be lifted soon.

48:14.992 --> 48:19.463
What's with these teen idol bands?
They're always breaking up.

48:21.899 --> 48:22.799
Where's JB?

48:23.967 --> 48:25.402
Wasn't he with you?

48:26.670 --> 48:30.107
When he heard about HershE,
he left for school right away.

48:31.475 --> 48:33.143
You said you wanted to go solo.

48:34.611 --> 48:36.013
HershE's not even your group.

48:37.681 --> 48:38.982
What do you care?

48:39.616 --> 48:42.419
You know HershE and I:dn
were close since our training days--

48:42.486 --> 48:44.121
Do you know why I like you?

48:45.956 --> 48:48.025
I have seen my fair share of kids
who make it as big as you.

48:49.593 --> 48:52.262
But do you know
what causes their downfall?

48:53.830 --> 48:55.098
When people say they have changed,

48:57.267 --> 48:59.503
they deny it and make excuses.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.705
They go on with their lengthy excuses.

49:03.407 --> 49:04.708
You have to be able to say

49:05.776 --> 49:08.612
that you've changed
and admit that you're special.

49:08.679 --> 49:12.015
That's the only way
you can move further up.

49:13.550 --> 49:15.452
That's why I liked you,

49:16.853 --> 49:19.589
but now I hear rumors
about you dating a Kirin student.

49:22.292 --> 49:23.827
Don't disappoint me further.

49:26.330 --> 49:27.731
You're a super idol.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.801
You're better
than that lowlife Jin Yu-jin.

49:33.136 --> 49:35.138
Don't get distracted.

49:36.306 --> 49:37.441
Focus on the audition.

49:43.046 --> 49:48.518
There's always a place higher up.
You want to get there, don't you?

49:57.027 --> 50:00.497
Na-na's not at the hospital.
They said she checked out.

50:02.899 --> 50:04.601
Do you know where she might be?

50:04.868 --> 50:06.636
She doesn't have many places.

50:07.371 --> 50:09.039
Things now are like
back when she was a trainee.

50:09.239 --> 50:12.075
So I'm guessing she could be
at the dorm or the studio.

50:21.485 --> 50:22.452
NA-NA

50:36.600 --> 50:38.568
It's all so chaotic.

50:38.835 --> 50:42.406
It's one thing after another.
It's like a minefield here.

50:43.306 --> 50:45.842
All we have to do is focus on the mission.

50:47.544 --> 50:50.447
-We need good ideas.
-How much time is left?

50:54.051 --> 50:57.654
We have lots of time.
Let's do the best we can.

51:04.294 --> 51:06.997
What? Why are you all
staring at me like that?

51:07.831 --> 51:11.768
We're proud of you, that's all.

51:12.436 --> 51:15.672
-Jeez.
-Was that a smile?

51:20.310 --> 51:24.648
All right. Let's do this.
But no humor this time.

51:25.549 --> 51:28.685
I'll get sick if I see another balloon.

51:29.252 --> 51:30.220
You're weird.

51:33.657 --> 51:34.791
Not bad at all.

51:36.827 --> 51:37.861
-Hello.
-Hello.

51:40.197 --> 51:43.100
-You're Hong-ju, right?
-Yes.

51:44.234 --> 51:48.338
Your touching serenade has already
made you an Internet sensation.

51:50.707 --> 51:53.944
And what perfect timing.
HershE just happened to break up.

51:56.146 --> 51:59.216
Do you know what I've learned
over the 20 years as a music producer?

52:01.818 --> 52:03.286
Sincerity works.

52:15.232 --> 52:16.199
Kids!

52:37.220 --> 52:38.288
Open the door.

52:39.723 --> 52:41.458
Na-na, open up!

52:42.859 --> 52:44.728
Are you okay?

52:47.531 --> 52:48.732
Na-na, open the door.

52:50.033 --> 52:51.668
Na-na, open the door!

52:52.502 --> 52:53.570
Na-na!

52:54.738 --> 52:55.839
Please open up.

52:56.673 --> 52:57.707
Are you okay?

52:58.742 --> 53:00.043
It's all over.

53:08.752 --> 53:09.653
Na-na!

53:10.086 --> 53:11.621
Na-na, open the door!

53:22.332 --> 53:24.134
What are you doing here?

53:25.468 --> 53:27.637
HershE's breakup doesn't change a thing.

53:29.239 --> 53:32.542
You can sing your own songs.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.745
Wherever it is,
you can just sing your own songs.

53:38.715 --> 53:40.383
Singing is everything to me.

53:43.653 --> 53:45.488
My voice is everything to me.

53:48.325 --> 53:49.392
But, I've lost everything.

53:52.796 --> 53:54.197
Why is singing everything?

53:56.233 --> 53:57.767
Why is your voice everything?

54:00.203 --> 54:01.037
What about me?

54:02.038 --> 54:03.006
What about Ailee?

54:05.942 --> 54:07.978
It's not over for us
just because HershE broke up.

54:10.547 --> 54:11.748
Aren't we your friends?

54:13.216 --> 54:14.517
Do we mean that little to you?

54:15.452 --> 54:16.987
How can you say
that you've lost everything?

54:17.954 --> 54:21.791
You can get treated,
whether by surgery or rehabilitation.

54:23.426 --> 54:25.695
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

54:35.038 --> 54:36.940
We'll be with you until then.

54:40.577 --> 54:45.315
How about it?
Should I:dn go down with the last hurrah?

54:46.082 --> 54:47.017
"The last hurrah"?

54:50.854 --> 54:51.788
Na-na.

55:26.589 --> 55:27.524
Hey, newbie.

55:33.663 --> 55:35.865
I heard that you're here
as the face of our group.

55:38.268 --> 55:40.704
Let's see here.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.108
You're pretty.

55:45.742 --> 55:47.210
We should be able to debut soon, then.

55:47.977 --> 55:50.347
-Really?
-Of course.

55:50.480 --> 55:54.117
With her looks and our vocal skills,
there's no doubt we'll be huge.

55:54.951 --> 55:56.986
Really? Well, I'm Ailee.

55:57.387 --> 55:59.089
This is Na-na. And you?

56:00.824 --> 56:03.793
I'm Lee Ji-gyeong.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.295
Ji-gyeong?

56:08.131 --> 56:10.700
What a name.

56:11.034 --> 56:12.869
You need a stage name.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.741
Since you're like the relief pitcher,

56:17.874 --> 56:20.243
coming in at the last minute to save us,
let's get you a nice name.

56:23.813 --> 56:24.814
How about Rian?

56:25.615 --> 56:26.449
Rian?

56:27.484 --> 56:28.685
What does it mean?

56:29.652 --> 56:32.355
The one who brings good luck to us.

56:32.889 --> 56:34.491
Okay.

56:34.591 --> 56:37.894
Well, since you'll make
our debut a lot easier,

56:38.695 --> 56:41.498
Rian sounds perfect. Do you like it?

56:42.632 --> 56:44.968
-Yes.
-Welcome aboard.

56:46.436 --> 56:47.337
Thanks.

56:52.575 --> 56:53.910
-Hey there.
-Is she the new member?

56:57.814 --> 57:00.850
-Pleasure.
-I'm Lee Ji-gyeong.

57:02.285 --> 57:05.789
Rian, watch out. Si-u's a big player.

57:06.756 --> 57:07.590
Why you...

57:09.659 --> 57:11.694
Nice to meet you. I'm JB.

57:13.229 --> 57:14.063
Hi.

57:15.799 --> 57:18.968
Come on, guys. Let's take a picture.

57:19.202 --> 57:20.036
Okay.

57:21.938 --> 57:24.841
One, two, three.

58:02.145 --> 58:05.048
I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

58:05.915 --> 58:09.686
-What are you doing?
-Solving math problems.

58:10.820 --> 58:11.921
Seriously?

58:14.090 --> 58:17.994
When things get all messy and frustrating,

58:19.028 --> 58:21.831
solving math problems can sometimes...

58:22.665 --> 58:23.533
Sometimes what?

58:24.300 --> 58:26.803
It helps me untangle the knots.

58:27.971 --> 58:29.606
You're an oddball.

58:33.042 --> 58:35.712
Don't you ever have times like that?

58:37.680 --> 58:42.986
When things get messy or tangled,
cutting that part off is the easiest.

58:44.187 --> 58:47.790
But you won't be able to use it anymore.

58:48.758 --> 58:50.994
No, you won't.

58:54.597 --> 58:56.599
There's someone I like,

58:57.033 --> 58:59.135
but he only does things I hate.

59:00.470 --> 59:02.105
I have no choice
but to cut him out of my life.

59:02.472 --> 59:06.075
How do you feel when you see him?

59:07.377 --> 59:08.511
Do you just resent him?

59:09.913 --> 59:13.182
It's not about liking or hating.
I just get really angry,

59:14.651 --> 59:16.085
to the point where I just can't stand it.

59:18.454 --> 59:21.391
Is he your boyfriend?

59:24.594 --> 59:25.695
My dad.

59:31.134 --> 59:33.069
-What?
-No. Why?

59:33.202 --> 59:34.304
What's that noise?

59:34.771 --> 59:38.508
-What's going on?
-No, please don't!

59:51.521 --> 59:52.355
Hello?

59:54.257 --> 59:55.258
At the school?

59:58.928 --> 59:59.762
Okay.

1:00:17.947 --> 1:00:21.217
We, I:dn, stand before you today

1:00:21.451 --> 1:00:23.519
to share with you a piece of good news.

1:00:24.087 --> 1:00:28.424
HershE and I:dn went through
a lot together since our trainee days.

1:00:28.825 --> 1:00:32.061
To support HershE's decision,
I:dn is now breaking up as well.

1:00:32.161 --> 1:00:35.665
-What?
-No, don't.

1:00:41.204 --> 1:00:44.941
All members of I:dn and HershE
will work on improving ourselves,

1:00:45.441 --> 1:00:49.545
and we promise that all five of us
will someday return to you.

1:00:50.580 --> 1:00:54.017
We thank Mr. Lee Gang-cheol
for giving us this opportunity

1:00:54.417 --> 1:00:57.253
to delve into our studies
and become full-fledged students.

1:01:00.957 --> 1:01:03.860
We would also like to thank
Producer Shin Jae-in

1:01:04.394 --> 1:01:09.132
for giving us new opportunities
through the Super Idol Audition.

1:01:11.968 --> 1:01:15.304
As we said earlier,
this is a happy occasion.

1:01:16.372 --> 1:01:18.307
Because today, we are not leaving you,

1:01:19.142 --> 1:01:21.377
but promising you
that we'll return as better artists.

1:01:22.545 --> 1:01:25.915
So, we've prepared
a small gift for all of you.

1:01:36.426 --> 1:01:38.995
Why is life so hard?

1:01:39.062 --> 1:01:41.264
Who said that life was beautiful?

1:01:41.330 --> 1:01:43.599
Since I was born, all that life gave me

1:01:43.666 --> 1:01:46.069
Was more trials to overcome

1:01:46.135 --> 1:01:48.404
During those times,
I looked into the mirror

1:01:48.471 --> 1:01:50.840
And asked myself, "What did I do wrong?"

1:01:50.907 --> 1:01:53.176
What did I do to deserve this?

1:01:53.242 --> 1:01:55.478
It feels like it'll never change

1:01:55.645 --> 1:01:58.181
-Don't you crumble under the pressure
-Do you remember this song?

1:01:58.247 --> 1:02:00.116
-Whatever life gives you
-We sang this together

1:02:00.183 --> 1:02:02.752
-at the trainee boot camp.
-Whatever this unfair world offers you

1:02:02.819 --> 1:02:04.887
If you just accept it, nothing will change

1:02:04.954 --> 1:02:06.889
Would you fight it or would you give up?

1:02:06.956 --> 1:02:09.258
Would you surrender to fate?

1:02:09.325 --> 1:02:11.194
Don't bow your head to the world

1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:13.196
Don't lose strength and look at us

1:02:13.262 --> 1:02:17.467
When you're tired and exhausted,
Lean on me

1:02:17.867 --> 1:02:22.505
I will always be by your side

1:02:23.106 --> 1:02:27.844
So that you never feel like you're alone

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:31.781
I'll be right beside you,
Holding your hand

1:02:32.849 --> 1:02:35.184
It's too dark
And I can't see what's ahead of me

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:37.920
All I have on me is one match
And one candle

1:02:37.987 --> 1:02:40.423
What could I do
With this one small candle?

1:02:40.490 --> 1:02:42.692
How would it drive away the darkness?

1:02:42.759 --> 1:02:44.894
I see the bright light in the distance

1:02:44.961 --> 1:02:47.330
And here I am making vain efforts
Alone in the dark

1:02:47.396 --> 1:02:51.968
I want to fly towards that bright light,
But I can't

1:02:52.034 --> 1:02:53.336
But that's not the case

1:02:53.402 --> 1:02:56.906
So much can happen
By lighting that one small candle

1:02:56.973 --> 1:03:01.477
I believed that there was nothing else
Around me, but there was another candle

1:03:01.577 --> 1:03:03.813
And when I lit it, they became two

1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:06.149
By the light of two candles,
I can find more

1:03:06.282 --> 1:03:07.950
And two becomes three,
And three becomes four

1:03:08.017 --> 1:03:09.719
And the darkness disappears

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:13.723
When you're tired and exhausted,
Lean on me

1:03:13.790 --> 1:03:14.624
Lean on me

1:03:14.690 --> 1:03:19.929
-I will always be by your side
-By your side

1:03:19.996 --> 1:03:24.100
So that you never feel like you're alone

1:03:24.167 --> 1:03:28.171
I'll be right beside you,
Holding your hand

1:03:28.671 --> 1:03:32.542
When you're tired and exhausted,
Lean on me

1:03:32.608 --> 1:03:35.311
I will always be

1:03:35.378 --> 1:03:38.114
by your side

1:03:38.181 --> 1:03:41.651
So that you never feel like you're alone

1:03:41.717 --> 1:03:47.256
I'll be right beside you,
Holding your hand

1:04:40.042 --> 1:04:41.177
Hong-ju, music.

1:05:01.864 --> 1:05:02.698
Done!
