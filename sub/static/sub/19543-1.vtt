Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:06.006 --> 00:09.089
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:09.176 --> 00:13.215
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:13.305 --> 00:16.638
Go Go Let's do it

00:17.851 --> 00:23.596
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:23.691 --> 00:29.561
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:29.655 --> 00:35.525
I'II protect you with my life

00:35.619 --> 00:41.740
Turn your courage to love into strength

00:41.834 --> 00:47.750
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

00:47.840 --> 00:55.008
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

00:56.348 --> 00:59.215
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:59.309 --> 01:02.517
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:02.604 --> 01:08.099

Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:11.155 --> 01:14.318
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:14.408 --> 01:21.496
Your soul already knows the answer

01:21.582 --> 01:25.200
Dragon Soul!

01:27.671 --> 01:29.536
Kakarrot?

01:29.631 --> 01:32.213
Yeah, a lower-class warrior child, right?

01:32.301 --> 01:35.714
Nothing to do but send him off
to some frontier planet, huh?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.465
I suppose not.

01:40.684 --> 01:45.178
On Planet Vegeta, a baby boy
cries for the first time.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.560
His father, and his mother planet,

01:48.650 --> 01:52.814
are about to be destroyed by a fearsome enemy.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.322
Freeza!

02:04.708 --> 02:06.448
Freeza!

02:07.836 --> 02:10.327
--|t's Freeza-sama!
--Freeza-sama!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.293
Everything changes now.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.750
The fate of Planet Vegeta, of Kakarrot...

02:17.971 --> 02:20.462
...as well as...

02:20.557 --> 02:23.048
...your fate!

02:24.102 --> 02:27.640
This is the end!

02:39.076 --> 02:41.112
W-What?!

02:58.387 --> 03:03.006
Ka... kar... rot...

03:06.228 --> 03:10.517
Kakarrot!!

03:39.553 --> 03:42.511
My son, Kakarrot...

03:42.598 --> 03:44.384
Carry on my dying wish!

03:44.474 --> 03:51.346
You must avenge the fall of
the Saiyans, and of Planet Vegeta!

03:56.612 --> 04:04.280
And so, a baby from a
faraway planet falls to Earth.

04:04.369 --> 04:09.363
He was a young boy who had taken
the charge of an unknown destiny.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.700
Let's name you... Goku!

04:12.794 --> 04:17.083
This is the tale of Son Goku.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.295
Son Goku would grow up healthy,

04:24.389 --> 04:25.890
and together with Bulma,

04:25.974 --> 04:31.014
go on ajourney to gather
the seven Dragon Balls,

04:31.104 --> 04:36.144
which were said to grant any wish.

04:39.655 --> 04:43.944
While on this journey,
Goku would meet many friends,

04:44.034 --> 04:45.740
go through much training,

04:45.827 --> 04:49.490
seek for greater strength, and fight.

04:53.335 --> 04:58.045
In his battle against the Demon Clan,
who sought to rule the world,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.838
he would increase his power even further

05:00.926 --> 05:03.508
under the guidance of the
martial arts sage Karin-sama,

05:03.595 --> 05:06.837
and masterfully put a stop to
the schemes of Piccolo Daimao,

05:06.932 --> 05:11.847
who had once again become
young with the Dragon Balls.

05:15.941 --> 05:20.810
Piccolo would leave behind
his offspring before dying.

05:22.531 --> 05:26.991
Three years later, Ma Junior,
the reincarnation of Piccolo,

05:27.077 --> 05:32.822
and a grown-up Goku would wage
battle in a fateful confrontation.

05:32.916 --> 05:39.003
Following a heated battle,
Goku would claim the victory.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.172
It's now a little more than five years later.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.048
Goku and Chichi had abruptly gotten married,

05:47.139 --> 05:50.597
and the people were living in peace.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.017
However...

06:14.875 --> 06:21.371
"Prologue to Battle! The Return of Son Goku. "

06:29.097 --> 06:32.760
Gohan-chan!

06:32.851 --> 06:35.888
Lunchtime!

06:35.979 --> 06:38.391
Gohan-chan!

06:48.825 --> 06:50.781
This is a good one.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.460
Gohan-chan!

07:02.547 --> 07:04.253
Ah, welcome home.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.832
Goku-sa, where's Gohan?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.627
I'm starving!

07:10.722 --> 07:14.135
What are you talkin' about?
Have you seen Gohan-chan?

07:14.226 --> 07:17.593
Huh? No, I ain't seen him.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.552
You have to hurry and eat before you leave,

07:19.648 --> 07:22.014
or you're goin' to keep Muten
Roshi-sama and the others waitin'.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.191
All right, I'll go look for him.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.984
I don't think he's gone too far away.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.279
Yeah. I'll take care of it!

07:29.366 --> 07:31.231
I'm countin' on you!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.491
You sure are pretty.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.077
My name is Son Gohan.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.039
Ah! Wait!

07:56.268 --> 08:00.307
Mother! Father!

08:09.698 --> 08:11.529
Gohan!

08:13.702 --> 08:15.943
F-Father!

08:19.374 --> 08:22.912
Sit tight! I'm coming to help right now!

08:23.003 --> 08:24.664
Gohan!

08:27.799 --> 08:29.835
A little farther...

08:36.515 --> 08:39.849
--Father!
--Gohan!

08:55.118 --> 08:57.951
Father!

09:00.040 --> 09:01.746
Gohan!

09:03.043 --> 09:04.123
Gohan!

09:04.211 --> 09:08.955
Father! I can't get down!

09:09.049 --> 09:12.758
I'm scared! I'm scared! Father!

09:15.347 --> 09:21.263
Father, I was so scared!
I was so scared, Father!

09:23.772 --> 09:25.854
Gohan...

09:28.526 --> 09:31.063
...how did you get up here?

09:33.698 --> 09:36.189
l-l don't know.

09:37.410 --> 09:41.574
Gohan, let's go home.
Mommy is worried about you.

09:41.665 --> 09:45.874
We have to be going to Old Timer
Turtle Hermit's place soon, too.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.417
Mm-hmm.

09:53.426 --> 09:58.011
Whoo, just about there...

10:28.586 --> 10:33.876
W-W-What was that just now?!
A meteor?! A UFO?!

10:49.733 --> 10:54.147
T-That's no meteor. What the heck is it?

11:32.567 --> 11:36.185
W-Who are you...?

11:39.741 --> 11:43.154
A battle power of just 5? What trash.

11:43.244 --> 11:47.738
D-Don't you come near me! |-|'|| shoot!

12:01.971 --> 12:05.680
Hmph. What a frail race this is.

12:07.685 --> 12:12.896
There's someone with a
large power here. Range 4,880.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.270
Is that you, Kakarrot?!

12:38.258 --> 12:42.342
W-What power is this?! It couldn't be...

12:42.429 --> 12:44.260
Son Goku?!

12:54.691 --> 12:56.602
No, it isn't!

13:04.159 --> 13:06.445
You're not Kakarrot.

13:06.536 --> 13:10.779
Who are you? Do you have
some business with me?

13:10.874 --> 13:13.206
I have no business with you.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.332
Then what did you come here for?
Do you want to die?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.831
You're mighty spirited, huh?

13:24.471 --> 13:30.091
Hmm, battle power 322. So there's
someone like you around, is there?

13:30.185 --> 13:31.550
Still...

13:31.644 --> 13:33.726
...you are no match for me.

13:33.813 --> 13:39.024
What was that?! Do you know
who you're saying that to?!

13:39.110 --> 13:40.850
Not really.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.982
What's with this guy's power...?

13:56.628 --> 13:59.620
Such a worthless technique.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.922
ls kicking up dust all it does?

14:07.889 --> 14:13.009
Is it my turn now? Well then, let me
show you a sampling of my moves.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.480
There's another large power.

14:29.702 --> 14:35.038
That way. Range 12,909. It's big.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.616
The biggest power on the planet.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.327
This time for sure, it's Kakarrot!

14:51.599 --> 14:54.261
l-lmpossible...

14:54.352 --> 14:57.970
H was shaking so hard, I couldn't move...

15:18.710 --> 15:20.200
Good afternoon!

15:20.295 --> 15:22.251
Long time no see!

15:22.338 --> 15:23.544
Bulma-san!

15:23.631 --> 15:27.123
You said come pay a visit, so here I am.

15:27.218 --> 15:30.551
Well, well, it really has been a long time.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.721
This house is the same
as it always has been, huh?

15:33.808 --> 15:35.309
You are so cold.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.180
Unless someone tells you
to come visit, you stay away.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.307
Here.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.559
Some manju buns, as a gift.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.642
You didn't have to go to all that trouble.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.275
If you'd just let me touch
your boobs a little bit...

15:52.243 --> 15:54.279
You don't appreciate my gags, same as ever.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.656
You're the same lecherous jerk as ever!

15:56.748 --> 16:00.411
By the way, Bulma-san, where is Yamucha-san?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.583
Yamucha? That idiot?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.747
How should I know about him?
lam so fed up with him,

16:06.841 --> 16:10.049
I didn't tell him we were
all getting together today.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.469
Let's have a blast without him!

16:13.556 --> 16:15.512
You sure do fight a lot, huh?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.215
They sure do.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.096
Incidentally, where is Lunch-san?

16:19.187 --> 16:22.975
She went off somewhere,
chasing Tenshinhan-san, five years ago.

16:34.285 --> 16:37.652
The location of this power is
moving at considerable speed.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.831
See? That's Muten Roshi-sama's house.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.335
Yoo-hoo!

16:46.422 --> 16:47.628
l-ls that...?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.455
--Son-kun!
--Goku!

16:49.550 --> 16:52.132
--Yo!
--Huh? What's with the boy?

16:52.220 --> 16:55.587
Have you started working
as a babysitter or something?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.047
He's my boy.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.722
Y-Yours, Goku?!

16:58.810 --> 17:01.222
Yeah, that's right. Is that strange?

17:03.815 --> 17:05.771
Go on, say hello.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.564
Good afternoon.

17:07.652 --> 17:11.190
--R-Right.
--Good afternoon.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.146
His name is Son Gohan.

17:14.242 --> 17:19.362
Son Gohan? | see, so you've given
him the name of your late grandpa?

17:19.454 --> 17:20.535
Yeah.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.579
l have to say, I'm amazed.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.204
To think that you'd be
bringing a child along, Goku...

17:25.294 --> 17:28.286
Gohan-kun, how old are you?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.167
I'm four years old.

17:31.259 --> 17:34.296
Wow, he has good manners,
considering he's your son, Son-kun.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.878
Chichi is really fussy about that.

17:38.641 --> 17:42.554
Say, Gohan-kun, what do you
want to be when you grow up?

17:42.645 --> 17:44.431
A great scholar.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.730
S-Scholar?

17:51.362 --> 17:52.442
A tail...?

17:52.530 --> 17:53.940
Yeah.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.612
Just like I used to have, right?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.782
Y-You're right.

17:59.996 --> 18:05.332
S-Say, does anything particularly
strange happen to your boy?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.409
Strange?

18:07.503 --> 18:11.496
F-For example, does he change
at all on nights with a full moon?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.297
Nights with a full moon?

18:13.384 --> 18:16.672
I don't know. We go to bed early at my house.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.763
--How come?
--N-Never mind, it's nothing.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.932
If that's the case, then all right.

18:23.019 --> 18:27.228
S-Say, Goku, is he strong, like you are?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.522
About that...

18:30.610 --> 18:33.443
I think he's got quite a bit of power,

18:33.529 --> 18:37.568
but when I try to train Gohan, Chichi gets mad.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.910
Rock, paper, scissors!

18:39.994 --> 18:42.781
What for? That's such a waste, isn't it?

18:42.872 --> 18:44.157
Ain't it?

18:44.248 --> 18:47.115
She says the world is at peace now,

18:47.210 --> 18:49.451
so we don't need martial arts no more.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.332
She says from now on, it's the age of studying.

18:55.092 --> 18:59.552
So that tomboy of a girl turned out
to be an education-minded mom?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.595
Father!

19:02.725 --> 19:06.593
Say, is that a Dragon Ball
stuck to Gohan-kun's hat?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.678
Yeah, that's Si Xing Qiu.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.014
It is a keepsake from my grandpa, after all.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.690
I searched for it, and stuck it on there.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.521
I found San Xing Qiu and
Liu Xing Qiu while I was at it.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.321
They're back at home.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.948
That sure takes me back.
The Dragon Balls, huh?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.574
--What's that?!
--What's wrong?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.957
S-Something's coming this way.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.760
Something's coming?

19:40.847 --> 19:44.806
It's awesome! I sense an
awesome power! What is it?!

19:54.193 --> 19:55.774
It's here!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.978
Here it comes!

19:58.072 --> 20:00.358
W-What is that?

20:03.077 --> 20:04.692
Who is it?!

20:06.539 --> 20:08.951
What a brutal bloodlust!

20:24.098 --> 20:26.510
So, we finally meet.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.179
You've grown up.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.857
But I knew it was you at first glance, Kakarrot.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.559
Kakarrot?

20:38.654 --> 20:42.146
You look just like our father.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.356
What does he mean?

20:43.451 --> 20:46.318
W-What is this? What's he talking about?

20:46.412 --> 20:50.121
Kakarrot, what is with
the condition of this planet?

20:50.207 --> 20:53.916
Your mission was supposed to be
to exterminate all of humanity.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.369
What the hell have you
been goofing around for?!

20:59.717 --> 21:03.926
Hey, now, hold on, you.
I don't know who you are,

21:04.013 --> 21:06.345
but go away, go away.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.968
Shoo,shoo!

21:08.059 --> 21:12.974
Man, it just isn't right to be
drunk this early in the afternoon.

21:13.064 --> 21:16.022
--Okay then, go on, go on.
--Kuririn! Keep away from him!

21:20.446 --> 21:22.027
Kuririn!

21:23.324 --> 21:25.030
Why, you...!

21:28.579 --> 21:32.913
What's this? A man with a tail has appeared.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.787
Just what is his terrifying true identity?

21:37.004 --> 21:39.916
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:40.007 --> 21:44.501
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:44.595 --> 21:47.428
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:47.515 --> 21:50.552
and zip away to wherever we want

21:50.643 --> 21:52.884
Being a daredevil is the best

21:52.979 --> 21:56.312
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:56.399 --> 22:02.190
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

22:02.279 --> 22:08.366
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:09.745 --> 22:12.703
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:12.790 --> 22:15.953
You were born

22:16.043 --> 22:21.663
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:21.757 --> 22:24.669
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:24.760 --> 22:27.877
Go at it full power

22:27.972 --> 22:31.931
Hope is my weapon,

22:32.018 --> 22:35.260
so believe in the future

22:39.650 --> 22:41.356
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:41.444 --> 22:44.436
If you've got the same sort
of tail that I did, who are you?!

22:44.530 --> 22:49.320
Remember, Kakarrot,
your mission, and your Saiyan pride!

22:49.410 --> 22:51.321
Father, help me!

22:51.412 --> 22:56.657
If you value your son's life,
you will obey your brother's orders.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.707
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.794 --> 23:03.003
"The Enemy is Goku's Brother?!
The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors. ”

23:03.090 --> 23:04.955
