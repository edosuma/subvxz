WEBVTT

01:17.840 --> 01:22.199
- Still haven't told Roman where we are?
- We don't need his backing.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.079
This is the place.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.399
We will find something here.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.479
Why are there so many kids here
from Les Agnettes? It's no coincidence.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.519
Kids go to gyms.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.319
There must be twenty gyms closer to them
than this one. Why this one?

01:50.120 --> 01:54.039
You know, sometimes you can't
correct mistakes. That's life.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.159
Khalil? What's wrong?

02:11.800 --> 02:14.359
- Maybe you're right.
- What do you mean?

02:14.880 --> 02:18.839
About mistakes.
Let's get back to the station.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.919
Aco.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.799
Tourists?

03:11.160 --> 03:14.119
- Piece of shit.
- Why?

03:15.080 --> 03:18.959
This is the holiday I've always dreamt
off. Mum, dad, 40 Kalashnikovs.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.559
Three rocket launchers.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.999
- Good equipment.
- Old equipment.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.719
For me this is a nostalgic moment.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.759
- After this I'm done with weapons.
- Totally?

03:31.880 --> 03:35.879
It's a matter of profits,
risks and boredom.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.159
Zlatko, where's my money?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.919
I'm getting tired of you.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.439
You're getting tired of me?

03:49.640 --> 03:53.919
Fuck you and listen carefully.
Stop playing me.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.999
The Animal has returned.

04:02.680 --> 04:07.079
That's how I like you.
The boss wants to go home.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.719
Go.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.519
You know why I was so keen
to have you with us?

05:26.640 --> 05:31.079
Because you grew up here,
so I thought you'd understand.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.319
There's nothing to understand.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.799
You're pursuing something
which no longer interests us.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.959
Marseille is delicate, it needs
to be handled by people with delicacy.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.999
Causing riots and bloodsheds
is not the answer.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.679
We know where the shooters are
in Serbia, that's enough.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.159
- There's still one in Marseille.
- And we have no new leads.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.839
Or have you seen something
sitting pointlessly outside that gym?

06:03.240 --> 06:05.919
And the death of the Belairs
doesn't interest you?

06:06.120 --> 06:08.759
The death interests me hugely.

06:08.880 --> 06:13.399
Shall we discuss how it happened?
And whose fault it is?

06:15.720 --> 06:19.199
I'm reassigning you.
Sim card fraud in Aix.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.039
I need you to head that up.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.759
- I'm off the case?
- No. The case is dead.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.199
You've a new job. In Aix.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.959
Thirsty?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.079
Here.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.319
Your friends still aren't answering
our calls.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.959
They've turned off our gun supply.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.399
We need the supply taken up again.
You need to help us.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.519
Dumb fucking Serb.
He can't understand a word.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.799
- How much trouble are we in?
- That's not your concern.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.799
Piece of shit.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.639
Khalil, I give up.
I don't feel up to this.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.279
- You chicken out?
- No, you don't need me.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.519
- Stay.
- My father would kick my ass.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.159
What are you saying, Halim?

08:29.840 --> 08:31.039
Son of a bitch.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.999
What kind of car is it?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.679
Peugeot 405. With Serbian plates
and a sticker with a hedgehog.

08:43.800 --> 08:47.399
There is a bag under the carpet
in the boot. They want the bag.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.879
- OK.
- See you in a bit.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.879
- Mokhtar.
- Khalil.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.839
Fuck.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.039
OK, Milan.
You know what you're doing.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.959
But I remember you came back home
in 2002 all covered in blood.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.479
Zlatko wanted to steal tiles.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.479
You were bedridden for a month
and he was fine.

15:02.600 --> 15:08.439
In 2003 he caused trouble in a bar
for a girl.

15:08.560 --> 15:11.959
You caught all the punches.
He didn't have a scratch.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.959
- In 2004...
- I know what he did.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.879
OK. It's up to you.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.039
It got worse every time.
A women got hurt, children...

15:26.120 --> 15:30.799
Every time you did something wrong,
he whispered it in your ear.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.679
He owes us money.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.319
We'll find it somewhere else.

15:36.440 --> 15:40.159
I've tried everything.
We need money for your surgery.

15:40.280 --> 15:43.559
Don't worry about me.
I'll hang in there for a while

15:43.680 --> 15:46.759
if you promise
not to visit Zlatko anymore.

15:47.680 --> 15:53.079
If you don't do it yourself,
you'll be his slave forever.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.599
- I need to go.
- Then go.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.999
Here you see the plans
of the architects in 3D.

17:01.080 --> 17:05.319
You can take a virtual walk
through the airport. It's very amusing.

17:05.440 --> 17:10.359
I will now introduce the people
who are part of the project.

17:11.080 --> 17:16.399
Unfortunately Guillaume von Reeth
can only join us virtually.

17:18.360 --> 17:21.879
Present: Henrik Porel Hoiston,
in charge of the concessions,

17:22.120 --> 17:25.399
James Deloitte, in charge of parking,

17:25.520 --> 17:28.959
and Zlatko Mladic, representing
his company Lugano Holdings

17:29.080 --> 17:32.479
that will be in charge of security.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.159
Any questions?

19:20.760 --> 19:24.079
I only had enough for one.
We can share, right?

19:24.200 --> 19:26.599
Have they called dad?

19:26.720 --> 19:29.279
Yes. He's on his way.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.159
That fucking dog... I was scared.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.359
You're OK now?

19:41.320 --> 19:45.679
Thank you for coming.
To do this at all.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.679
You'd do the same for me, right?

19:52.960 --> 19:54.519
Do we open it?

19:55.880 --> 19:58.719
He said not to open it.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.479
We've got ten minutes
before dad is here. Shall we open it?

20:10.920 --> 20:12.039
Shit.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.999
Shit.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.479
Nadim is coming to get it.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.959
I won't come every time you call.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.359
- That?
- Are you training now?

20:41.480 --> 20:45.999
Don't fuck with me. I saw you.
I saw the cars.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.399
I saw them leave.
The foreign number plates.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.919
What calibre are they?

20:52.040 --> 20:55.039
What are you saying?
You're losing it?

20:58.160 --> 20:59.919
You're fucking with me.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.879
Mokhtar, you're going to be in deep
shit. This is for real. So tell me.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.359
- Tell you what?
- The Serb.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.559
- What about the Serb?
- Where is he?

21:07.680 --> 21:10.999
How would I know?
- There's a link with the guns.

21:12.320 --> 21:15.879
You're my little brother, I'll fix it,
but you have to talk to me.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.279
Get off my back with your bullshit.

21:19.720 --> 21:23.119
For once in your life make
the right choice, jackass.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.999
You always considered me a shithead,
didn't you?

21:26.120 --> 21:28.999
You want to talk about the blood
on your hands?

21:30.560 --> 21:34.639
Dad was right, you know.
You really have a screw loose.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.999
- Do as I say.
- We're not doing anything.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.039
Stop. Let go of me.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.279
Stop moving. I'll hurt you.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.399
Let go of me.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.719
You never understood anything.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.639
You'll never understand anything.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.679
Get fucked, you and your Serb.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.359
Every time you come home
with different bruises.

25:52.720 --> 25:57.239
Do you want to drink something?
Something to eat?

25:57.800 --> 25:59.439
No, I'm OK.

26:08.240 --> 26:14.119
I saw him. Last Tuesday.
He was walking past the shop. I hid.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.359
Mokhtar?

26:19.600 --> 26:22.159
Do you see him?

26:24.960 --> 26:27.399
When I see him, I avoid him too.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.199
How did this happen?

26:36.600 --> 26:38.039
I don't know.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.639
You threw me out, I wasn't there.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.519
Your father thought he understood what
was best. Sometimes he was wrong.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.119
When I came back I thought
I'd be able to fix things.

26:53.960 --> 26:58.079
You can.
You just can't fix everything.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.279
Nadim.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.159
I thought I'd be seeing you.

27:08.640 --> 27:14.439
Were you going to charge in here and
threaten me? For hurting your friend?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.879
You didn't hurt him, you killed him.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.879
He left you at the site.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.119
He left you behind
like a piece of shit.

27:23.240 --> 27:28.159
So I showed him.
And by showing him, showed everyone.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.599
There is a new king in town
and that king is me.

28:09.360 --> 28:10.639
Yes?

28:21.600 --> 28:24.759
- It's Manu, from Marseille.
- Who?

28:25.080 --> 28:28.599
We sold him Kalashnikovs.
Milan's friend is alive.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.199
The guys who found...
What's his name?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.559
Rajko.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.799
They think he's important to me.

30:08.080 --> 30:12.119
I told them that nobody's important
to me. What matters is what we do.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.399
Are you going to give me trouble?

30:22.440 --> 30:24.999
Why would I bring you trouble?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.519
He was like a father to you.
To me too.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.879
We always call him the boss.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.759
That means we're not going
to go save him.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.279
Dragan is an old story,
it will interfere more than anything.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.319
The new Caesar must kill the old one.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.639
We do this and you get your money.

37:00.720 --> 37:04.479
Give me the keys. Give them to me.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.679
What's this all about?

37:06.800 --> 37:08.399
He wants to kill you.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.439
- Kill me?
- Yes.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.199
I wanted Milan to kill you.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.679
You could have had everything.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.999
- It was a test of your loyalty.
- Fuck your loyalty.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.119
Listen.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.919
You shoot and he will kill you.
Then he'll kill your brother.

37:33.040 --> 37:37.999
Don't shoot and maybe
you'll get a chance to warn him.

37:39.880 --> 37:43.119
If I were you I would not be a wimp
and I'd shoot straight after.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.599
Shoot.
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.199
Give me the keys.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.159
Throw your weapon on the ground.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.239
Start the car.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.279
Drive. Quick.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.359
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.

43:08.880 --> 43:12.359
- Where's Manu?
- He told you that we'd come to you.

43:12.480 --> 43:17.719
He promised me less blood.
A girl died, an officer shot...

43:28.960 --> 43:31.639
Otherwise what? You'll arrest us?

43:35.040 --> 43:38.039
Listen, little fuck. I'm not
in the mood for your bullshit.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.759
Roman, let go of him.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.159
He may be a little fuck
but he's my little fuck. Release him.

43:55.400 --> 44:00.239
Now. Let's see
how we can sort this shit out.

44:13.960 --> 44:17.799
- What's that?
- I thought you'd like to meet.

44:17.920 --> 44:21.439
I've got a Serb no one wants
and all the police is after him.

44:22.040 --> 44:25.599
- So what?
- I need you.

44:25.720 --> 44:27.559
All this shit is because of him.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.839
Call this killing two birds
with one stone.

44:31.960 --> 44:36.199
- You won't regret it.
- This isn't how this works.

44:37.840 --> 44:41.959
Trust me. I've got a solution
to all our problems.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.639
Come on, get in.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.159
Run.

46:22.200 --> 46:24.399
Leave.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.119
Go on.

46:31.600 --> 46:32.999
Move.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.999
Move.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.199
Stop. Police.

46:44.040 --> 46:47.279
- What are you playing at?
- Run.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.159
Stop. Police.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.479
What the fuck are you doing?

46:58.880 --> 47:02.119
If he talked he was a problem.
As a quiet man he had no use.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.439
This way you're a hero.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.079
And now you need to help me.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.999
The Serbs have cut me off.
I need guns.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.799
But you need to turn a blind eye.
Take it.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.679
The cost of peace.

47:47.680 --> 47:50.879
- He has the IGS on his tail?
- Yes.

47:55.160 --> 47:58.119
He did nothing wrong.
He did his job.

47:58.240 --> 48:01.919
We got our man. Coming for a drink?

48:02.360 --> 48:03.519
I'm going home.

48:03.640 --> 48:07.559
Sure? OK, see you tomorrow.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.399
Here is good.

48:23.800 --> 48:26.559
- How do we travel without a car?
- By foot.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.879
We're not gonna get far by foot.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.199
Further than in a stolen car
with a broken window.

48:32.920 --> 48:35.639
He wanted to kill me. Me.

48:35.760 --> 48:38.599
And then he talked about loyalty.
Asshole.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.159
- Hello?
- Adnan, my brother.

48:42.280 --> 48:44.599
- It's you, Milan.
- Listen to me.

48:44.720 --> 48:48.879
Leave your flat right away.
Do you remember where the safe house is?

48:49.000 --> 48:52.119
- Go there right away.
- Why?

48:52.240 --> 48:54.519
They're coming to get you.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.679
It's my fault.

48:57.640 --> 48:59.319
I'm sorry. I'm in trouble.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.679
