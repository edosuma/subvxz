00:05.827 --> 00:08.448
<i>Previously, on Stargate SG-1...</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:11.172
It's over, Jack.
No extensions, no reversals,...

00:11.185 --> 00:12.929
...no new hearings.

00:12.986 --> 00:16.984
The Stargate will be buried,
literally and figuratively.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.143
We should attempt to open the gate.

00:19.184 --> 00:21.757
We'd be court-martialled
the second we got back.

00:21.783 --> 00:22.864
<i>If we got back.</i>

00:27.542 --> 00:29.949
We're on an attack ship headed to Earth.

00:29.981 --> 00:32.603
<i>The mighty warrior, Klorel.</i>

00:32.621 --> 00:35.290
<i>- I'm gonna grab Skaara.
- Are you sure?</i>

00:35.301 --> 00:37.709
It would be like trying to take Apophis.

00:39.780 --> 00:42.938
<i>You will get to see your home
one last time...</i>

00:42.939 --> 00:47.268
...before you and everyone
on your planet are destroyed.

00:50.898 --> 00:52.095
Skaara!

00:54.737 --> 00:57.572
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

01:12.893 --> 01:15.465
- Captain Carter?
- Sir?

01:15.492 --> 01:17.984
Is there enough C4 around this ship
to make a dent?

01:18.010 --> 01:21.170
The charges should generate
secondary explosions.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.368
So... yes, sir. Should make a helluva dent.

01:24.370 --> 01:25.400
Thank you.

01:25.489 --> 01:29.287
- Given enough time, I may figure out...
- Negative!

01:29.289 --> 01:31.531
Their reinforcements
may come any second.

01:31.569 --> 01:34.847
Stand by to detonate your charges
on my order.

01:34.847 --> 01:35.926
Yes, sir.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.206
Wait...

01:37.287 --> 01:40.526
Daniel, if we don't stop them now,
we may never stop them.

01:40.527 --> 01:42.566
Yeah, I know that.

01:47.126 --> 01:50.625
Let's just make
as big a dent as possible. OK?

01:56.164 --> 01:58.950
Ready and awaiting your order, sir.

02:00.123 --> 02:01.118
OK.

02:01.201 --> 02:06.112
Well, I suppose now is the time
for me to say something profound.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.230
Nothing comes to mind. Let's do it.

02:17.239 --> 02:18.187
O'Neill,...

02:18.278 --> 02:21.114
...Apophis's ship approaches.

02:21.758 --> 02:25.457
We heard him say he'd rejoin Klorel
once they came out of the shadows.

02:28.037 --> 02:28.985
Teal'c,...

02:29.075 --> 02:31.781
...if we can knock out this ship,
will it stop them?

02:31.795 --> 02:33.289
It will not.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.106
Apophis's vessel has defence shields.

02:36.115 --> 02:38.155
He can still destroy your cities.

02:41.992 --> 02:44.991
Tell me those C4 charges
are on an automatic timer.

02:44.992 --> 02:46.402
They are.

02:46.473 --> 02:48.465
- Good. How long do we have?
- 24 hours.

02:48.512 --> 02:49.971
24 hours?!

02:50.031 --> 02:52.522
At the time, sir,
I thought we were still light years away.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.710
<i>Just a minute!</i>

02:54.751 --> 02:59.549
Teal'c, work with me, buddy.
Is there any other way outta here?

02:59.550 --> 03:00.580
None.

03:01.788 --> 03:03.199
Cover up.

03:06.429 --> 03:09.713
This is turning out to be a bad day.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.747
Agh!

04:43.887 --> 04:45.927
O'Neill?

04:51.446 --> 04:53.485
Teal'c...

04:53.524 --> 04:55.564
Aah...

05:02.283 --> 05:04.322
Teal'c,...

05:04.682 --> 05:06.141
...I can't see.

05:06.201 --> 05:09.521
I am blinded as well. It will pass.

05:09.521 --> 05:11.810
What the hell was that?

05:11.841 --> 05:13.382
A Goa'uld shock grenade.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.918
Though extremely painful,
its effects are temporary.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.959
That's good to hear.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.882
Ow!

05:20.959 --> 05:22.701
God! Ow!

05:22.759 --> 05:24.798
Colonel?

05:24.838 --> 05:26.915
Sorry, sir. It's just so dark.

05:26.957 --> 05:28.997
Oh... Carter!

05:30.077 --> 05:33.475
It's all right. I like your attitude.

05:33.476 --> 05:35.516
It isn't dark. We're blind.

05:35.716 --> 05:37.707
And we failed.

05:37.755 --> 05:40.507
All right, take it easy, Daniel.

05:40.514 --> 05:43.218
We've been in worse situations than this.

05:43.235 --> 05:45.689
Not to my knowledge.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.752
Thanks, Teal'c.

05:47.793 --> 05:51.391
Right now they're preparing
to wipe out the major cities of Earth.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.096
They'll do it from orbit, out of reach.

05:54.112 --> 05:55.108
Daniel...

05:55.192 --> 05:58.709
Jack, I've been through this once before.
I've seen this before.

05:58.711 --> 06:00.786
Daniel, will you relax?

06:00.831 --> 06:04.709
You've been through it before
and you survived.

06:04.709 --> 06:08.576
We're... just having a bad day.

06:09.749 --> 06:12.666
Colonel, I think
I'm starting to see something.

06:12.668 --> 06:15.752
- My sight returns as well.
- That's what I wanna hear.

06:16.507 --> 06:17.502
Carter,...

06:17.586 --> 06:21.425
...if someone comes in here, you...

06:21.425 --> 06:23.632
...bite 'em in the hand.

06:23.665 --> 06:25.908
Yes, sir.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.579
Tal kree, shak!

06:53.738 --> 06:56.976
Forgive me, master.
I will not fail Klorel again.

06:56.978 --> 06:57.973
No.

06:58.058 --> 07:00.098
You will not.

07:09.656 --> 07:11.696
What the hell are you doing here?

07:11.735 --> 07:15.334
Reporting for duty, sir.
I'm to coordinate with the Pentagon.

07:15.334 --> 07:19.812
- By whose order?
- At the request of Senator Kinsey.

07:19.812 --> 07:21.853
He did try to contact you.

07:21.893 --> 07:24.134
Why aren't our forces on full alert?

07:24.173 --> 07:27.089
If we don't move now
they'll be caught on the ground.

07:27.091 --> 07:30.930
The Pentagon don't want to alert
the Goa'uld we know they're there.

07:30.930 --> 07:33.303
Let me guess whose bright idea that was.

07:33.331 --> 07:36.488
General Hammond, may I speak freely?

07:36.490 --> 07:40.528
I seem to have lost your respect, sir,
for whatever reason,...

07:40.528 --> 07:43.564
...but we wouldn't be in this situation,
that is,...

07:43.567 --> 07:46.355
...at the brink of war with the Goa'uld,...

07:46.367 --> 07:49.526
...if you had heeded my advice
and buried the Stargate.

07:49.526 --> 07:51.935
Was that "I told you so",
Colonel Samuels?

07:51.966 --> 07:54.636
I'm not here to point fingers, sir.

07:55.206 --> 07:59.643
I'm here to help coordinate our
pre-emptive strike against the Goa'uld.

07:59.644 --> 08:03.083
That's if the President approves.
He's being briefed now.

08:03.084 --> 08:06.242
- With what do you intend to strike?
- A new weapon, sir.

08:06.242 --> 08:09.362
I've helped to oversee
its development at area 51.

08:09.362 --> 08:14.079
Two prototypes are being prepared
for launch at Vandenberg Air Force base.

08:14.081 --> 08:16.951
If all goes well,
history should mark this day...

08:16.961 --> 08:21.079
...by two brilliant and unexplained flashes
that occur in the night sky.

08:21.081 --> 08:24.865
The world should never know
how close we came to Armageddon.

08:44.475 --> 08:48.312
<i>- Kel Klorel?
- Your son was struck down by humans.</i>

08:48.313 --> 08:50.140
He is in his sarcophagus?

08:50.193 --> 08:52.767
Yes, my lord, but his wounds were great.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.702
It will take time to revive him.

08:54.753 --> 08:57.750
- What of the humans?
- I thought to wait until Klorel...

08:57.751 --> 08:59.709
No!

08:59.751 --> 09:01.412
Execute them now!

09:01.471 --> 09:03.629
I will see to it myself.

09:11.149 --> 09:13.188
We hold our position.

09:13.229 --> 09:17.013
The humans of this world
still send no challenge.

09:17.707 --> 09:20.792
Yet they find their way to my son.

09:22.866 --> 09:27.494
We will attack their world
when Klorel has risen again.

09:27.586 --> 09:31.500
They will pay a hundredfold
for their insolence.

09:31.744 --> 09:33.783
Kel sha, Apophis.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.980
The Goa'uld's unexplained delay
is buying us time to prepare.

09:46.981 --> 09:49.222
We'll strike as soon as they enter orbit.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.668
What makes this weapon so special?

09:51.700 --> 09:56.898
An otherwise ordinary
Mk 12-A warhead,...

09:56.899 --> 09:59.977
...has been enriched
by the alien material naqahdah.

09:59.979 --> 10:02.221
- The Stargate element?
- Yes, sir.

10:02.258 --> 10:07.535
A small amount of the raw ore
was found by SG-5 and brought back.

10:07.537 --> 10:12.294
The warheads should now yield
in excess of 1,000 megatons... each.

10:12.296 --> 10:14.870
We call them our Goa'uld busters.

10:14.895 --> 10:20.133
Our plan is to launch two rockets
simultaneously into retrograde orbit.

10:20.134 --> 10:23.812
Now, the naqahdah-enriched warheads...

10:23.813 --> 10:27.371
...are made of the same material
as our Stealth aircraft,...

10:27.373 --> 10:30.159
...and should go undetected by their radar.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.587
Assuming the Goa'uld
have anything remotely like radar.

10:35.371 --> 10:37.411
It's our best shot, sir.

10:37.450 --> 10:41.994
And I'm sure the President agrees
or he wouldn't have initiated countdown.

10:43.849 --> 10:47.099
Currently,
we stand at T minus three hours.

10:47.528 --> 10:52.902
We'll hold at two minutes
while the Goa'uld come within range.

10:53.606 --> 10:55.645
It's going to work, sir.

10:55.687 --> 10:58.177
The Goa'uld should be taken off guard.

10:58.206 --> 11:02.563
If you're wrong, every country on Earth
will be caught off guard.

11:02.565 --> 11:04.937
If it were up to me,
I'd recommend warning...

11:04.964 --> 11:08.083
With respect, sir, it's not up to you.

11:14.363 --> 11:18.657
Well, on the bright side,
my hand isn't blurry any more.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.921
<i>Teal'c?</i>

11:48.315 --> 11:49.311
Bra'tac?

11:50.274 --> 11:51.224
Oh, God!

11:51.315 --> 11:53.355
<i>Fools! Hashak!</i>

11:53.394 --> 11:56.792
You doom yourselves.
It is all I can do to keep you alive!

11:56.793 --> 12:00.672
Do you know all I have done
to regain the trust of Apophis...

12:00.673 --> 12:02.749
...and join this campaign? Hmm?!

12:02.793 --> 12:03.788
Hmm?!

12:03.871 --> 12:04.903
Tek matte, Bra'tac.

12:09.030 --> 12:12.548
Hello again, old friend.

12:12.549 --> 12:14.589
Your son grows strong.

12:14.629 --> 12:17.085
One day, he will be a great warrior.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.677
But you should not have come.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.748
I stand by my friends.

12:22.788 --> 12:27.105
<i>This world may be our only hope
in one day overcoming the false gods.</i>

12:27.106 --> 12:28.518
Yes.

12:28.586 --> 12:31.374
As pathetic as that may seem
at the moment,...

12:33.665 --> 12:35.326
...I agree.

12:35.384 --> 12:37.092
You do?

12:37.144 --> 12:40.982
I may even have been able
to save this world had you not interfered.

12:40.984 --> 12:43.023
Hey!

12:43.663 --> 12:46.201
What do you think
we've been trying to do?

12:46.222 --> 12:48.510
<i>It is our world you're talking about.</i>

12:48.543 --> 12:49.491
Enough, human!

12:51.221 --> 12:53.048
This is not the place to talk.

12:53.101 --> 12:57.230
I have been ordered by Apophis himself
to execute you.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.870
An order I intend to disregard.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.653
Come!

13:14.336 --> 13:17.337
- Kill the gate, Corporal!
- Yes, sir!

13:21.495 --> 13:23.534
They still haven't moved?

13:23.575 --> 13:26.030
No, sir. Not for the last 18 hours.

13:26.053 --> 13:28.722
What in God's name are they waiting for?

13:28.732 --> 13:32.371
My mission analysis team believes
they're waiting to see what we do.

13:32.373 --> 13:37.171
Amazingly, the Russians and Chinese
haven't detected the Goa'uld presence.

13:37.172 --> 13:39.841
Of course, they're not looking.
So, from space,...

13:39.851 --> 13:43.690
...we should appear to be
a vulnerable and unsuspecting world.

13:43.691 --> 13:45.730
Got 'em just where you want 'em?

13:46.529 --> 13:49.648
There may be another reason
why they haven't attacked.

13:49.649 --> 13:51.605
We have the computer enhancement.

13:51.649 --> 13:55.846
There was an energy burst, coming
from the bridge of one of the ships,...

13:55.847 --> 13:58.385
...recorded at 1750 hours.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.649
Just before they stopped.

14:04.926 --> 14:06.966
That's it?

14:07.326 --> 14:11.563
For all we know, that flash could be
part of their ship's normal function.

14:11.565 --> 14:15.644
Except that the burst came from
within the ship. It was powerful.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.356
Maybe an explosion? An accident?

14:19.403 --> 14:20.945
Or sabotage.

14:21.001 --> 14:22.331
SG-1.

14:24.481 --> 14:25.596
I hardly think so.

14:25.681 --> 14:28.847
For one thing,
it's impossible to gate to a ship.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.158
Forgive me, sir.
I know how important SG-1 is to you,...

14:33.159 --> 14:35.447
...but this is wishful thinking.

14:35.479 --> 14:39.393
So's your plan. That hasn't stopped us
going ahead with it.

14:40.998 --> 14:45.076
General Hammond, the first group
on the Alpha list has just arrived.

14:45.076 --> 14:47.153
Thank you.

14:50.076 --> 14:52.115
Here are your weapons.

14:53.634 --> 14:55.673
You will need them.

14:56.115 --> 15:01.192
Um, Bra'tac, you mentioned
something about... saving the world?

15:01.193 --> 15:04.511
- Care to elaborate on that?
- By assaulting Klorel,...

15:04.513 --> 15:07.466
- ...you have made that impossible.
- Why?

15:07.471 --> 15:10.470
A pharaoh's power
is more often challenged by their sons...

15:10.471 --> 15:12.048
...than by their enemies.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.981
Once we had joined battle
with your world,...

15:14.990 --> 15:19.548
...I was prepared to lead my wing
against Apophis, in Klorel's name.

15:19.548 --> 15:23.548
Apophis would assume your attack
was ordered by Klorel and reciprocate.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.375
A daring plan.

15:25.427 --> 15:28.381
I had hoped to drive
a stake of mistrust between them.

15:28.388 --> 15:31.666
Now they will bond
against their common enemy.

15:31.667 --> 15:32.912
What bond?

15:32.985 --> 15:36.153
- Klorel's dead.
- He will rise again.

15:39.265 --> 15:41.057
The sarcophagus.

15:42.585 --> 15:46.863
Wait a minute. You put him
in that thing to bring him back?

15:46.864 --> 15:50.101
I knew it would delay their attack
until he arose.

15:50.102 --> 15:52.059
<i>Perhaps when the warships
of your world attack, we...</i>

15:52.101 --> 15:55.380
<i>Uh, excuse me, did you say
the ships of our world?</i>

15:55.381 --> 15:56.959
You have such vessels?

15:57.981 --> 16:01.178
Well,... we have a number of... of...

16:01.179 --> 16:03.422
<i>Shuttles.</i>

16:04.340 --> 16:06.379
These... shuttles,...

16:07.219 --> 16:09.259
...they are a formidable craft?

16:09.857 --> 16:11.898
Oh, yeah.

16:13.217 --> 16:14.592
Yeah.

16:14.657 --> 16:16.198
Bad day.

16:20.855 --> 16:24.615
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as you have all been made aware,...</i>

16:24.615 --> 16:26.027
<i>Chevron four encoded.</i>

16:26.095 --> 16:28.134
...this nation,...

16:28.174 --> 16:30.961
...the entire world, faces a deadly threat.

16:32.494 --> 16:34.533
<i>Chevron five encoded.</i>

16:34.693 --> 16:38.691
With this knowledge,
you have all volunteered for a mission...

16:38.692 --> 16:41.729
...intended to preserve humankind.

16:41.730 --> 16:45.850
You've been chosen because
you represent the best we have...

16:45.850 --> 16:48.721
...in all fields of expertise.

16:48.730 --> 16:50.273
<i>Chevron six encoded.</i>

16:50.330 --> 16:53.967
What you have not yet been told,
for reasons of security,...

16:53.969 --> 16:58.133
...is where you're going
or how you're going to get there.

16:58.927 --> 17:00.470
<i>Chevron seven locked.</i>

17:04.326 --> 17:06.615
You're going to step through that.

17:07.685 --> 17:09.845
Once through the Stargate,...

17:09.885 --> 17:14.603
...you will find yourself
on the opposite side of this galaxy.

17:14.604 --> 17:17.689
A place we call Alpha site.

17:18.443 --> 17:20.483
If we do not prevail,...

17:20.521 --> 17:22.563
...you, and those that follow,...

17:22.603 --> 17:25.438
...will call it... home.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.082
A new colony.

17:29.441 --> 17:31.480
Godspeed.

17:44.278 --> 17:47.029
<i>Kel mak tak, Tauri!</i>

17:48.717 --> 17:52.215
Let us burn their world to ashes.

17:55.756 --> 17:57.463
<i>They're moving.</i>

17:58.675 --> 18:00.633
Restart the countdown.

18:00.674 --> 18:02.548
Hold at T minus 20 seconds.

18:02.594 --> 18:06.176
We'll launch the weapons
the moment they settle into orbit.

18:12.832 --> 18:15.239
We accelerate. Klorel has risen.

18:15.592 --> 18:17.916
Then the campaign has begun.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.349
Once we launch,
we will do what damage we can.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.390
How many in your wing?

18:24.709 --> 18:25.704
Three.

18:28.348 --> 18:29.510
Three?

18:29.588 --> 18:31.664
Teal'c makes four.

18:31.708 --> 18:33.748
Oh, well, four.

18:33.948 --> 18:37.145
I have trained these warriors
since they were Chal'tii.

18:37.146 --> 18:41.224
They have sworn their lives to me.
It is no simple thing to ask.

18:41.226 --> 18:43.266
And we appreciate it.

18:43.306 --> 18:46.584
But what are the odds of
taking out a ship like this...

18:46.585 --> 18:49.982
...with four gliders and... maybe a shuttle?

18:49.983 --> 18:52.226
A Goa'uld attack vessel is armed,...

18:52.263 --> 18:56.142
...shielded, and capable of launching
a legion of gliders against us.

18:56.143 --> 18:57.720
I would say... slim.

18:57.782 --> 19:00.737
OK. Call me a pessimist,
but it's time for a new plan.

19:00.741 --> 19:04.420
We offer to lay down our lives
for your world, human.

19:04.421 --> 19:05.962
You cannot ask more.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.891
No. But I think a better idea
is to get the other guys...

19:08.900 --> 19:11.438
...to lay down their lives
for their world first.

19:14.378 --> 19:16.454
How long before the C4 goes?

19:16.498 --> 19:18.123
41 minutes, sir.

19:18.178 --> 19:21.895
OK, with any luck at all,
this ship is gonna blow within the hour.

19:21.896 --> 19:25.135
It might be a good idea for us
to get to the other one.

19:25.136 --> 19:27.175
Can you do that?

19:47.851 --> 19:51.210
They're in a geosynchronous orbit
over the United States.

19:51.211 --> 19:53.962
Lock in that attack profile,...

19:53.970 --> 19:56.886
...and advise the President
we are go for launch.

20:21.564 --> 20:23.971
Vandenberg reports a good launch.

20:24.002 --> 20:26.042
Yes!

20:27.682 --> 20:29.923
I'm sorry, sir. For what it's worth,...

20:29.961 --> 20:32.880
...I seriously doubt SG-1
is aboard those alien ships.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.512
Weapons should reach their targets in...

20:36.520 --> 20:37.932
...four minutes.

20:39.201 --> 20:42.616
Let's keep moving these people
through to the Alpha site.

20:44.319 --> 20:46.560
Group nine, prepare to disembark.

20:46.878 --> 20:51.756
Let's wait and see the result of our strike,
before moving more people through.

20:51.757 --> 20:54.756
- I don't think so.
- Evacuation may be unnecessary.

20:54.757 --> 20:57.923
From your mouth to God's ears, Colonel.

21:02.875 --> 21:05.330
Have you more of this 4-C?

21:06.115 --> 21:08.071
It's called C4.

21:08.114 --> 21:13.108
- And no. We used it to take out this ship.
- You guys must have something left.

21:14.192 --> 21:17.278
We shall have to cross that bridge
when we come to it.

21:18.352 --> 21:21.950
You know,
that particular... clichÃ© doesn't...

21:21.951 --> 21:23.990
...always work.

21:25.430 --> 21:27.588
<i>The warheads have separated.</i>

21:27.628 --> 21:28.625
One minute to go.

21:28.710 --> 21:32.375
- Any indication of countermeasures?
- They won't know what hit 'em.

21:35.748 --> 21:38.286
My lord, they launch weapons against us.

21:38.307 --> 21:40.633
<i>Let them come.</i>

21:43.146 --> 21:44.641
30 seconds to impact.

21:44.705 --> 21:47.458
Still no countermeasures.

21:47.984 --> 21:49.894
Go, go.

21:57.782 --> 22:00.107
Their weapons approach, my lord.

22:00.143 --> 22:03.013
You must activate the shield.

22:04.221 --> 22:06.261
Klorel, tal shak!

22:07.381 --> 22:08.460
Tal shak!

22:17.298 --> 22:18.923
Impact in seven,...

22:18.979 --> 22:20.438
...six,...

22:20.499 --> 22:21.614
...five,...

22:31.296 --> 22:33.336
Whoa, what was that?

22:33.375 --> 22:35.616
Something may have
impacted the shields.

22:37.575 --> 22:41.852
Reports say the warheads struck
an energy field just prior to impact.

22:41.853 --> 22:44.260
- No damage.
- That's impossible!

22:44.294 --> 22:47.959
NASA confirms, sir,
the Goa'uld ships are still up there.

23:30.084 --> 23:31.541
Not bad.

23:31.603 --> 23:34.604
The peltak is two decks above. This way!

23:38.882 --> 23:39.876
Yes, sir.

23:39.961 --> 23:44.679
The EMP caused by the explosion has
affected our satellite communications.

23:44.680 --> 23:50.557
It's too late to warn the general public.
It will only cause mass panic.

23:50.558 --> 23:55.037
Mr. President, I recommend we maintain
the highest defence condition.

23:55.038 --> 23:57.197
You should board Air Force One.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.076
Yes, sir.

24:08.555 --> 24:14.058
<i>Klorel, it is time.
You will burn their first city to the ground.</i>

24:15.673 --> 24:19.152
<i>Father,
the host you chose for me is strong.</i>

24:19.153 --> 24:22.750
I fear I may need more time
in the sarcophagus to gain strength.

24:22.751 --> 24:25.503
You are strong enough! You are my son!

24:28.310 --> 24:29.935
Yes, Father.

24:31.349 --> 24:34.055
Do not disappoint me.

24:48.625 --> 24:49.871
Looks clear.

24:49.945 --> 24:53.544
No. There are sentries in every corridor.

24:53.545 --> 24:57.079
- Carter, how many grenades?
- Two left.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.535
<i>- Grenades?
- A crude explosive device.</i>

25:01.542 --> 25:03.999
<i>No! Observe...</i>

25:04.022 --> 25:06.063
...and learn.

25:15.340 --> 25:16.715
Ough!

25:16.779 --> 25:18.404
Urgh!

25:20.939 --> 25:22.564
Hmm!

25:24.459 --> 25:26.498
Not bad.

25:31.257 --> 25:35.414
General Hammond, Major Castleman
reports Alpha teams 12 and 13...

25:35.415 --> 25:39.213
- ...are briefed and ready to disembark.
- Send them through.

25:39.214 --> 25:40.211
General,...

25:41.615 --> 25:44.853
...maybe we should consider
using the Stargate...

25:44.854 --> 25:47.143
...as a strategic weapons platform.

25:47.173 --> 25:48.169
How?

25:48.252 --> 25:53.291
By sending a bomb to the coordinates
Dr. Jackson spoke of. Or to Chulak.

25:53.292 --> 25:57.650
We already tried to send a team through.
It won't work.

25:57.651 --> 26:02.359
And I can't think of any military reason
to wipe out the people of Chulak.

26:03.650 --> 26:05.523
Well, sir,...

26:07.769 --> 26:12.406
...since I am no longer
wanted or needed here,...

26:12.407 --> 26:14.696
...I respectfully request permission...

26:14.728 --> 26:17.219
...to join a team headed for the Alpha site...

26:17.248 --> 26:19.702
Permission denied.

26:19.726 --> 26:22.395
The idea is to send the best and brightest.

26:23.006 --> 26:25.045
When the time comes,...

26:25.085 --> 26:29.044
...you'll stand with the men and women of
this command, in defence of this facility.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.788
But, sir...

26:30.845 --> 26:35.340
I ask no more or less of myself.
Dismissed!

26:47.560 --> 26:51.855
- All right, here's what we do...
- I will lead. You will follow.

26:52.960 --> 26:53.955
Right.

27:01.797 --> 27:03.789
You will know when it is time.

27:03.836 --> 27:05.913
You're gonna walk in there alone?

27:05.955 --> 27:08.529
I am Klorel's loyal servant.

27:20.353 --> 27:22.393
<i>Bra'tac.</i>

27:22.432 --> 27:24.010
My lord, Klorel.

27:27.911 --> 27:28.906
Come.

27:28.991 --> 27:32.069
Witness the power of your God.

27:32.070 --> 27:34.479
I cannot.

27:39.749 --> 27:43.249
- Why do you defy me?
- Because you are not a God.

27:44.468 --> 27:47.302
You are a parasite within a child,...

27:47.627 --> 27:49.371
...and I despise you.

27:49.426 --> 27:51.883
Jaffa, kree tai!

27:52.507 --> 27:54.380
<i>I am your God!</i>

27:55.026 --> 27:58.229
And you will feel my wrath!

27:59.224 --> 28:00.848
I...

28:00.903 --> 28:02.896
...die...

28:02.944 --> 28:04.854
...free!

28:04.903 --> 28:07.111
Let's go. Daniel, watch our backs.

28:14.182 --> 28:16.221
Orgh!

28:24.419 --> 28:26.044
Jaffa! Tal shak!

28:33.577 --> 28:34.527
<i>Jack!</i>

28:37.936 --> 28:39.217
Agh!

28:49.134 --> 28:51.173
Daniel...

28:52.212 --> 28:53.243
Dammit!

28:53.333 --> 28:56.892
- I'm dead anyway. Just get outta here.
- I am not leaving you here!

28:56.893 --> 29:00.171
You're just gonna blow up
with the other ship anyway!

29:00.172 --> 29:03.042
What difference does it make? Go!

29:05.451 --> 29:07.490
Just go!

29:10.930 --> 29:13.172
I'll stay and watch your back.

29:29.405 --> 29:31.861
He's... staying behind.

29:34.605 --> 29:35.802
Come.

29:57.358 --> 29:58.390
Jaffa!

29:58.479 --> 30:00.057
Come.

30:01.638 --> 30:02.884
Come!

30:03.038 --> 30:05.410
If you fire upon us, I will kill Klorel!

30:05.518 --> 30:08.186
Bra'tac, how dare you betray me?

30:08.196 --> 30:13.653
I have spent 133 years
worshipping false gods.

30:14.435 --> 30:15.266
No more!

30:29.392 --> 30:32.642
Colonel, the C4 on the other ship
goes in six minutes.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.790
How do we blow this ship?

30:35.830 --> 30:39.910
When we were on Klorel's vessel
I directed it closer to this one.

30:39.911 --> 30:44.067
If we disable this shield generator,
both vessels will explode.

30:44.068 --> 30:46.606
Two birds with but one stone.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.708
This way.

31:06.184 --> 31:08.391
<i>You disappoint me, my son.</i>

31:08.423 --> 31:11.094
<i>Father, please...</i>

31:11.104 --> 31:13.060
...forgive me.

31:18.541 --> 31:20.949
The shield generators are far below.

31:20.981 --> 31:23.603
There, in the very bowels of the ship.

31:23.621 --> 31:27.298
We must climb down several decks,
through the length of the ship.

31:27.299 --> 31:29.506
Then, taking our weapons, we must...

31:43.697 --> 31:45.736
Grenades.

31:46.615 --> 31:49.237
We are no longer protected
by an energy field.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.461
So, that's it?

31:52.734 --> 31:54.561
That is it.

31:54.614 --> 31:57.615
I think what the Captain is asking
is "what now?"

31:58.893 --> 32:00.932
Now we die.

32:00.972 --> 32:03.381
Well, that's a bad plan.

32:03.412 --> 32:05.653
Where are the glider bays from here?

32:15.809 --> 32:18.887
Sir, reports say the ships
are moving closer together.

32:18.888 --> 32:20.928
What's the status of the shuttle Endeavor?

32:20.968 --> 32:22.510
Standing by.

32:22.567 --> 32:25.237
We've got to find out
what's going on up there.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.273
Carter,...

32:41.364 --> 32:43.356
...you and I will go in first.

32:43.403 --> 32:45.146
We'll take up positions... to...

32:46.323 --> 32:47.698
Never mind.

32:47.762 --> 32:49.173
<i>Observe.</i>

32:56.760 --> 32:58.421
Cover!

33:02.319 --> 33:05.154
<i>Now, that was a grenade! Come!</i>

33:29.233 --> 33:31.903
Human, put this on.

33:32.353 --> 33:34.974
Will you please stop calling me human?

34:43.097 --> 34:45.137
<i>No!</i>

35:17.731 --> 35:20.648
Our time is up. We have got to go.

35:20.648 --> 35:23.105
Punch it.

35:42.525 --> 35:45.682
Sir, we've got reports
from all over the country!

35:45.684 --> 35:48.436
A huge fireball in the night sky!

36:02.280 --> 36:03.275
Bra'tac?

36:04.320 --> 36:06.525
Bra'tac!

36:06.559 --> 36:08.599
You OK?

36:08.679 --> 36:10.717
Not bad.

36:10.759 --> 36:12.335
For an old man.

36:17.237 --> 36:19.563
<i>Colonel? Come in.</i>

36:20.596 --> 36:21.840
We're OK, Captain.

36:21.916 --> 36:23.458
Same here, sir.

36:23.516 --> 36:26.753
But we didn't buy ourselves much time.
Our glider's had it.

36:26.755 --> 36:28.250
I concur.

36:28.315 --> 36:31.673
<i>- We got cooked in the explosion.
- Captain...</i>

36:31.675 --> 36:34.425
We're low on power
and in a fairly low orbit,...

36:34.434 --> 36:37.751
...so it won't be long before
we burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

36:37.751 --> 36:38.914
<i>Captain,...</i>

36:38.992 --> 36:41.032
...take a look up.

36:49.349 --> 36:51.389
It's beautiful.

36:53.949 --> 36:56.025
Yes, it is.

36:58.028 --> 36:59.652
We saved it, sir.

37:00.628 --> 37:02.751
Yes, we did.

37:07.186 --> 37:10.056
Incoming traveller! Incoming traveller!

37:11.545 --> 37:13.585
It's SG-1's signal, sir.

37:13.625 --> 37:15.664
Open the iris.

37:27.702 --> 37:29.576
Dr. Jackson!

37:29.621 --> 37:31.864
Was SG-1 aboard one of those ships?

37:31.900 --> 37:33.230
Yes.

37:34.581 --> 37:36.574
Well... Well, how did you get...

37:36.619 --> 37:39.076
There was a Stargate
aboard the ship we were on.

37:39.099 --> 37:43.496
Once we were close enough to use Earth
as a point of origin, I dialled P3X-984.

37:43.498 --> 37:44.411
The Alpha site?

37:44.498 --> 37:47.617
Yeah. They called it the Beta site
in the alternate reality.

37:47.617 --> 37:49.277
Where's the rest of SG-1?

37:55.536 --> 37:57.907
<i>It'll be a beautiful sunset, sir.</i>

37:57.934 --> 37:59.809
You know, Captain,...

37:59.855 --> 38:03.900
...this wasn't such a bad day after all.

38:03.934 --> 38:05.974
Not bad at all.

38:09.813 --> 38:11.804
We die well, Teal'c.

38:11.853 --> 38:14.557
More than that, old friend.

38:15.891 --> 38:17.931
We die free.

38:23.449 --> 38:25.489
Or not.

38:29.289 --> 38:31.329
<i>Uh, Houston, this is Endeavor.</i>

38:31.367 --> 38:33.159
<i>We have 'em in sight.</i>

38:33.206 --> 38:35.876
<i>I repeat, we have 'em in sight.</i>

39:00.802 --> 39:02.840
Master Bra'tac,...

39:05.440 --> 39:07.931
...words cannot express our gratitude.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.844
You are Hammond, of Texas?

39:14.878 --> 39:16.918
I am.

39:20.277 --> 39:22.235
Your warriors serve you well.

39:22.277 --> 39:27.438
I know they will be sorry
to see you return home so soon.

39:27.876 --> 39:31.873
I must return, before word
of our rebellion reaches Chulak.

39:32.835 --> 39:35.077
My place is there.

39:56.789 --> 39:59.956
This way, sir. We want to ask
a few questions before you leave.

40:15.465 --> 40:17.505
Not bad at all.

40:19.425 --> 40:23.422
SG-1, there's someone
who'd like to see you.

40:34.302 --> 40:35.333
Daniel.

40:45.659 --> 40:47.697
Space monkey.

40:48.737 --> 40:49.733
Yeah!

40:49.784 --> 40:54.333
Repair and Synchronization by Ach
Enjoy
