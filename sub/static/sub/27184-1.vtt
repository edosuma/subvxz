02:11.148 --> 02:12.580
The sky is black.

02:12.582 --> 02:14.649
The water is poison.

02:14.651 --> 02:16.718
Brothers and sisters,

02:16.720 --> 02:20.190
these earthquakes that
shake us up each day,

02:21.124 --> 02:22.692
they ain't natural.

02:32.034 --> 02:35.202
Come on,
baby, come over here.

02:39.175 --> 02:41.508
Brought
to you by Sino-Gazam.

02:41.510 --> 02:43.045
Have a nice day.

02:44.313 --> 02:46.480
Those venturing out
onto the SuperGrid

02:46.482 --> 02:48.014
do so at their own risk.

02:48.016 --> 02:51.119
Jackal tribes are deadly
and will shoot on sight.

02:52.321 --> 02:54.521
Earthquake levels
are on the rise.

02:54.523 --> 02:57.158
Stay in cities, stay safe.

onto the SuperGrid

03:09.737 --> 03:11.370
do so at their own risk.

03:11.372 --> 03:12.707
Fuck you, bud.

03:14.074 --> 03:17.777
Earthquake
levels are on the rise.

03:45.572 --> 03:46.838
Have a nice day.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.606
We never should have
allowed them to leave

03:48.608 --> 03:49.808
in the first place.

03:49.810 --> 03:53.845
Now we've got 60 million Americans
dying of the hard lung.

03:53.847 --> 03:56.213
Thousands of new
cases every day,

03:56.215 --> 03:58.449
and no one taking
responsibility.

03:58.451 --> 04:00.451
And if you think it's
tough in the cities,

04:00.453 --> 04:02.118
be a cargo runner
for the mob and spend

04:02.120 --> 04:03.354
a day on the SuperGrid.

04:03.356 --> 04:05.356
The death tolls are triple.

04:10.161 --> 04:11.327
Allowed them to leave?

04:11.329 --> 04:13.596
When you sell six million
hectares to another country,

04:13.598 --> 04:15.799
they're allowed to do
whatever they want with them.

04:15.801 --> 04:17.200
Shut up, I'm talking now,

04:17.202 --> 04:18.134
it's my show.

04:18.136 --> 04:20.637
You act like there
was some other choice.

04:20.639 --> 04:21.838
The national debt...

04:21.839 --> 04:24.107
Of course
there was another choice.

04:24.109 --> 04:25.308
At least there was
before we started

04:25.310 --> 04:30.114
to parcel out parts of our
country to the highest bidder.

04:42.660 --> 04:45.329
Hello, Deke,
we've been looking for you.

04:51.902 --> 04:54.070
Okay, okay.

04:55.338 --> 04:55.973
Hi, Deacon.

04:59.375 --> 05:01.110
You have some explaining to do.

05:02.545 --> 05:04.846
You know, you didn't
need to come down here.

05:04.848 --> 05:07.248
Believe me, I didn't
fucking wanna come down here.

05:08.718 --> 05:11.719
I just wanted to hear it
from my own donkey's mouth.

05:11.721 --> 05:13.256
You failed your run.

05:13.923 --> 05:15.158
Why?

05:24.199 --> 05:26.466
Your driver was inexperienced.

05:26.468 --> 05:29.269
The driver was your
fucking sister, Deacon.

05:29.271 --> 05:30.670
It wasn't her fault.

05:30.672 --> 05:31.939
It doesn't matter to
me whose fault it was,

05:31.941 --> 05:34.507
and I'm actually
sorry for your loss.

05:34.509 --> 05:36.244
But it was a crucial run, man.

05:37.779 --> 05:39.646
Now you gotta go back.

05:39.648 --> 05:42.582
We had a deal, one more run.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.618
I did what I could.

05:44.620 --> 05:45.454
Did you?

05:47.288 --> 05:48.122
Really?

05:49.390 --> 05:50.556
That's funny.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.391
Because if you did,

05:52.393 --> 05:55.260
I don't think we'd
all be here right now.

05:55.262 --> 05:57.563
I mean, you'd probably
be having dinner

05:57.565 --> 06:00.499
with your sister Jude
and your whole family.

06:00.501 --> 06:01.967
Why don't you just
send your goon squad?

06:01.969 --> 06:03.902
Listen, kid, this
isn't a fucking

06:03.904 --> 06:06.307
negotiation anymore, okay?

06:07.273 --> 06:09.240
You gotta do this
under the radar.

06:09.242 --> 06:12.811
Complete it, or we'll kill the
only sibling you have left.

06:12.813 --> 06:14.980
Speaking of which, you'll
get a lot further this time

06:14.982 --> 06:18.151
if you just get your old
driver out of retirement.

06:19.552 --> 06:21.287
It's your last shot, buddy.

06:21.989 --> 06:22.822
Make it count.

06:25.525 --> 06:27.859
Guys, guys, he's
got a big job to do,

06:27.861 --> 06:29.894
so you know, keep away
from his hands and the eyes

06:29.896 --> 06:32.563
and the rest of
his fucking spirit.

06:32.565 --> 06:33.765
Eh, eh, eh.

06:33.767 --> 06:38.335
Honey, don't worry,
it'll be quick.

06:38.337 --> 06:40.205
It's that grid life.

06:52.918 --> 06:54.484
I'm sorry, buddy.

06:54.486 --> 06:57.356
Good luck, and we'll see
you in a couple days.

07:05.363 --> 07:07.998
Overwatch,
for your protection.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.632
Call now.

07:13.038 --> 07:14.972
Shit, Deke, you're sick.

07:16.974 --> 07:17.809
Who isn't?

07:24.782 --> 07:25.616
No.

07:35.826 --> 07:38.027
Do you think he'll go with you?

07:38.029 --> 07:40.530
No, but I gotta try.

07:42.632 --> 07:44.267
Give this to him, would you?

07:47.336 --> 07:47.971
Yep.

08:33.914 --> 08:34.847
You know
they make those things

08:34.849 --> 08:36.283
so no one else can fix them now.

08:38.019 --> 08:39.254
Shit, you've got nerve.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.557
Give me a bucket, quick.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.958
You shouldn't be drinking.

09:23.429 --> 09:24.897
What are you
having for dinner?

09:26.132 --> 09:28.433
I could stay, help
make something.

09:34.439 --> 09:35.975
Forgot how fun you
were to talk to.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.478
All right, well,
I gotta go back.

09:41.646 --> 09:42.946
For what?

09:42.948 --> 09:44.482
Yeah, I got one more run.

09:47.152 --> 09:47.786
One more run?

09:49.754 --> 09:51.388
I don't have a choice, man.

09:52.157 --> 09:53.390
Get out.

09:54.192 --> 09:55.725
Give me a chance to explain.

09:55.727 --> 09:56.560
Get out!

10:07.471 --> 10:08.503
Hey.

10:08.505 --> 10:09.274
I'm leaving, I get it.

10:12.643 --> 10:14.543
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

10:14.545 --> 10:15.711
You could've spared my sister.

10:15.713 --> 10:16.814
Our sister.

10:21.085 --> 10:23.584
I'm not dying on that
fucking grid, Deke.

10:23.586 --> 10:25.155
We'll be back in two days.

10:26.489 --> 10:27.757
Is that what you told Jude?

10:32.162 --> 10:34.128
Get the fuck outta here.

10:41.204 --> 10:43.771
Those
venturing out onto the SuperGrid

10:43.773 --> 10:45.873
do so at their own risk.

10:45.875 --> 10:49.576
Jackal tribes are deadly
and should be avoided.

10:49.578 --> 10:51.678
Earthquake levels
are on the rise.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.048
Stay in cities, stay safe.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.751
Brought to you by Sino-Gazam.

10:57.753 --> 10:58.820
Good morning.

11:44.864 --> 11:45.665
Fuck.

11:51.171 --> 11:52.472
Goddammit, Deke.

12:28.773 --> 12:30.908
Smoking with the
lung, real smart.

12:38.783 --> 12:41.119
You're gonna wanna see this.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.692
Wow, now that's a
letdown on wheels.

12:48.692 --> 12:50.658
Shut up.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.695
Get in the hood.

12:57.701 --> 12:58.600
Is that a?

12:58.602 --> 13:00.236
Thorium cell.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.771
Yeah, I took it as a
parting gift on my last run.

13:02.773 --> 13:04.739
And you put it into the this?

13:04.741 --> 13:07.075
Yeah, it's a big
enough chassis,

13:07.077 --> 13:08.578
and it's what Spanner had.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.680
Hands to God, or
this truck's next

13:13.682 --> 13:15.252
paint job is arterial red.

13:16.619 --> 13:17.720
How'd you get in here?

13:18.888 --> 13:20.954
You gave me the
code, remember?

13:20.956 --> 13:23.059
Not so you'd show
up unannounced.

13:25.127 --> 13:26.595
You bring me a fucking drink?

13:36.172 --> 13:37.006
That's better.

13:39.408 --> 13:40.740
Little Deke.

13:40.742 --> 13:41.743
Hey, okay.

13:44.879 --> 13:46.115
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

13:47.116 --> 13:48.915
It's nice to see you, man.

13:48.917 --> 13:50.284
You too, Spanner.

13:50.286 --> 13:51.853
I would fuck you, now.

13:53.389 --> 13:56.591
So you put a Thorium cell
generator in an antique shitbox?

13:58.726 --> 14:01.727
Hid it in an antique shitbox.

14:01.729 --> 14:03.963
This will outlast any
Jack car on the grid,

14:03.965 --> 14:05.732
and no need to trade for fuel.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.934
So how's that skin coming?

14:08.936 --> 14:11.870
I installed ballistic glass,
tacked on this carbon fiber,

14:11.872 --> 14:14.039
just waiting on you
for the cowboy lining.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.040
Is this thing bulletproof?

14:15.042 --> 14:16.643
Not proof.

14:17.744 --> 14:18.645
Resistant.

14:19.713 --> 14:21.213
Will it stop a bullet or not?

14:21.215 --> 14:22.314
I don't know.

14:22.316 --> 14:24.651
Are you using this car to
primarily stop bullets?

14:26.320 --> 14:27.718
Nope.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.622
Hey, we should
start this thing up.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.727
Does this mean
you're coming with me?

14:35.928 --> 14:37.761
Yeah, like I'd just
leave you out there like...

14:37.763 --> 14:38.664
I left Jude?

14:41.934 --> 14:42.768
Get in.

14:44.804 --> 14:46.906
If anybody's gonna kill
you, it's gonna be me.

14:50.343 --> 14:52.076
Hang on, Little D.

14:52.078 --> 14:53.776
Coming outta retirement.

14:53.778 --> 14:56.746
Brothers Campbell, ride again.

14:56.748 --> 14:57.747
Whoo.

15:00.952 --> 15:02.154
I'm gonna move.

15:18.436 --> 15:20.370
So where we going?

15:20.372 --> 15:22.472
Across the border,
that's all I know.

15:22.474 --> 15:24.073
What's our cargo?

15:24.075 --> 15:25.308
I don't know.

15:25.310 --> 15:26.442
You don't know
what the cargo is?

15:26.444 --> 15:27.443
No.

15:27.445 --> 15:28.877
Jesus Christ.

15:28.879 --> 15:30.846
Fuck, what's it matter?

15:30.848 --> 15:32.748
It's not like we get to pick
and choose our runs anyways.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.185
No, but you can prepare.

15:35.753 --> 15:37.688
As soon as you don't prepare,
that's when you get hit.

16:09.519 --> 16:13.820
Jesse, whoopee,
it's good to see you

16:13.822 --> 16:17.125
on the side of your
brother for his final run.

16:18.026 --> 16:18.860
Well done.

16:20.028 --> 16:21.429
That's not what
you're driving.

16:21.431 --> 16:23.465
I don't think she
likes your car, guys.

16:25.033 --> 16:25.867
Follow me.

16:27.302 --> 16:28.270
You better listen.

16:31.873 --> 16:34.007
We can get you onto
the grid at two p.m.

16:34.009 --> 16:35.275
Make sure you're well fed.

16:35.277 --> 16:36.942
You'll need to overnight
out there before you hit

16:36.944 --> 16:37.745
the border wall.

16:39.514 --> 16:41.215
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

16:42.351 --> 16:44.451
Coordinates,
fueling locations,

16:44.453 --> 16:46.553
Jackal ambush groups
and blockades.

16:46.555 --> 16:48.588
You've both dealt
with Jacks before,

16:48.590 --> 16:50.456
but now they're more desperate.

16:50.458 --> 16:54.193
Without weapons or water to
trade, you won't last a mile.

16:54.195 --> 16:56.595
You've got 250 water cells.

16:56.597 --> 16:58.199
Trade them wisely.

16:59.866 --> 17:02.368
Deke still has the mission
details, don't you, Deke?

17:02.370 --> 17:03.602
What's this?

17:03.604 --> 17:05.439
All in good time, get packed.

17:12.912 --> 17:14.381
Yeah, we're off in an hour.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.452
We have no Overwatch,
that's why I'm calling you.

17:21.588 --> 17:24.057
And no one knows the route
better than you and Owl.

17:25.592 --> 17:27.592
You're not gonna
make me beg, are you?

17:27.594 --> 17:28.428
Deke?

17:29.862 --> 17:30.595
Yeah.

17:30.597 --> 17:31.531
Let's go.

17:55.019 --> 17:56.653
Papers?

18:13.671 --> 18:15.406
Here we go.

18:55.444 --> 18:56.445
Aw, fuck no.

18:58.047 --> 18:59.179
Helps with the stress.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.516
Chew some fucking gum.

19:01.983 --> 19:04.050
How far to the first
fuel barricade?

19:04.052 --> 19:05.987
I think like 20 miles up B12.

19:08.324 --> 19:09.325
How about be sure?

19:11.292 --> 19:14.293
Campbell,
confirm your frequency.

19:14.295 --> 19:15.528
Confirmed.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.630
Stay
on this channel,

19:16.632 --> 19:19.232
report back when you've
made it across the border.

19:19.234 --> 19:20.068
Copy.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.407
Where do you
wanna overnight, Black Lake?

19:27.409 --> 19:28.243
Yeah.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.109
You still
talk to Eagle?

19:31.111 --> 19:32.043
Here and there.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.111
She's holding it down out there,

19:33.113 --> 19:35.347
but the lakes are polluted now.

19:35.349 --> 19:37.182
They're gonna need water
cells pretty badly.

19:37.184 --> 19:37.819
Yeah, I bet.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.923
So, uh, you two still, you know?

20:12.685 --> 20:15.553
It's weirdly quiet, are
you sure about this?

20:15.555 --> 20:16.787
Jacks
barricaded the roads.

20:16.789 --> 20:18.422
There's no other way through.

20:18.424 --> 20:20.025
30 water cells should do it.

20:20.793 --> 20:22.760
Better let
me do the talking.

20:22.762 --> 20:24.762
Don't do anything stupid.

20:24.764 --> 20:25.565
Me?

20:46.618 --> 20:49.084
Where you all headed?

20:49.086 --> 20:49.688
To the border.

20:52.089 --> 20:53.690
In this thing?

20:53.692 --> 20:55.259
We got 30 cells to pass.

21:08.839 --> 21:10.106
We're gonna need 50.

21:13.142 --> 21:15.211
Fine, 50 cells.

21:16.714 --> 21:17.748
Nice negotiating.

21:19.449 --> 21:20.648
Shit.

21:20.650 --> 21:21.850
You ain't as pretty
as the last driver

21:21.852 --> 21:24.118
they brought through here.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.154
Remember her?

21:26.556 --> 21:29.025
The boys up the road had
quite the time with her.

21:29.859 --> 21:31.261
What the fuck you say?

21:32.295 --> 21:34.764
Deke, get back in the truck.

21:36.164 --> 21:37.798
You wanna get farther
than you got last time,

21:37.800 --> 21:39.500
pull 50 more cells.

21:39.502 --> 21:40.868
We're gonna need 100.

21:40.870 --> 21:42.803
We won't make
it to the border.

21:42.805 --> 21:44.304
That's not our problem.

21:44.306 --> 21:46.106
If you wanna get his
piece of shit up the road

21:46.108 --> 21:48.308
far enough to see what
the coyotes left behind

21:48.310 --> 21:52.579
of the last driver,
hand over 50 more cells.

21:57.151 --> 21:58.585
What the fuck.

21:58.587 --> 22:00.185
Get in the truck.

22:02.189 --> 22:03.757
Fuck.

22:10.899 --> 22:12.498
What about being discreet?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.702
We couldn't afford to
give up that much water.

22:16.737 --> 22:17.836
I thought we didn't
have Overwatch.

22:17.838 --> 22:18.804
We don't.

22:18.806 --> 22:20.472
Well you were hanging
halfway outta the car,

22:20.474 --> 22:22.075
and I didn't shoot that guy.

22:23.878 --> 22:25.346
Oh, here we go.

22:29.684 --> 22:31.551
Guan Yin, Brezhnev,
do you copy?

22:32.485 --> 22:34.220
Guan Yin, Brezhnev, come in.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.656
Campbell brothers.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.925
The brothers schmuck,
you got Lazlo.

22:39.927 --> 22:40.993
Did you send an Overwatch?

22:40.995 --> 22:43.227
Did I send a
support team to cover you?

22:43.229 --> 22:44.262
No.

22:44.264 --> 22:45.263
Are you sure?

22:45.265 --> 22:46.230
Who are you,
the fucking president?

22:46.232 --> 22:49.367
You don't get backup,
you're on your own.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.269
Fucking prick.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.273
Here.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.445
What's with your fucking fork?

23:00.847 --> 23:01.614
It's adorable.

23:19.297 --> 23:22.465
Come out to the grid,
she says, no big deal.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.469
You'll be fine, no
one's gonna get hurt.

23:27.438 --> 23:29.507
Oh, what do you have
to say for yourself?

23:31.209 --> 23:32.143
Tough break.

23:39.817 --> 23:40.883
They're all fish in a barrel.

23:40.885 --> 23:44.287
Not sure that was necessary,
headed your way now.

23:48.659 --> 23:49.559
Are you Overwatch?

23:50.527 --> 23:51.695
Put down the gun.

23:53.497 --> 23:55.332
That's my brother
at your feet.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.168
Put it down, go back inside.

23:59.736 --> 24:01.605
You know there's a
sniper scope on you.

24:19.855 --> 24:20.690
Sorry.

24:36.271 --> 24:38.406
Here goes nothing.

25:05.033 --> 25:05.866
Eagle.

25:08.635 --> 25:09.670
It's okay.

25:13.373 --> 25:14.374
You have any water?

25:18.078 --> 25:19.376
Can you get those
pads over there?

25:19.378 --> 25:20.411
Yeah.

25:20.413 --> 25:21.414
Thank you.

25:22.315 --> 25:23.717
About that water.

25:25.719 --> 25:26.918
Thank you.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.352
You're welcome.

25:31.691 --> 25:33.993
Jesse, you can't
just catch it, go help.

25:36.496 --> 25:38.829
He's right, you know,
it's caused by exposure.

25:38.831 --> 25:40.664
First stage is
cough, then shakes,

25:40.666 --> 25:42.767
but I've seen it get much worse.

25:42.769 --> 25:45.470
Like a leprosy that
poisons both mind and body.

25:50.442 --> 25:51.276
Dick.

26:03.088 --> 26:05.289
We have fungi
growing in the fields.

26:06.458 --> 26:08.558
They slow down the
symptoms of it.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.759
We used it to cure the soil

26:09.761 --> 26:11.663
after the supplements
stopped coming in.

26:12.831 --> 26:15.597
It's the closest thing
we have to medicine.

26:15.599 --> 26:17.934
More medicine
than what we've got.

26:17.936 --> 26:19.468
Off the grid, they still
think it's a virus,

26:19.470 --> 26:21.572
and PharmacAid's just
making out like bandits.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.642
I wish we could
give you more water.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.409
You need it to
cross the border.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.343
I get it.

26:28.345 --> 26:29.812
We should be able to
trade with the Jacks

26:29.814 --> 26:30.915
for some meat with it.

26:31.949 --> 26:32.783
I know, but...

26:33.918 --> 26:34.752
It's okay.

26:45.528 --> 26:46.663
Here, drink some water.

26:52.836 --> 26:54.035
Pretty gross, huh?

26:54.037 --> 26:55.638
Yeah, you're
pretty disgusting.

26:59.441 --> 27:01.474
Where's a
good place to camp?

27:01.476 --> 27:02.877
I was thinking
the north hills.

27:02.879 --> 27:04.477
There's shacks
all over the res.

27:04.479 --> 27:06.479
You park at the
foot of the hills,

27:06.481 --> 27:07.915
that's probably the safest.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.649
It's not safe here?

27:09.651 --> 27:13.486
Uh, not with you guys here,
after Deke's last overnight.

27:13.488 --> 27:15.457
The Consortium came
looking for us.

27:19.528 --> 27:20.493
Do you need any more guns?

27:20.495 --> 27:22.662
We have guns, we need water.

27:22.664 --> 27:24.498
You need the guns
more than we do.

27:27.903 --> 27:28.971
You should get going.

27:30.538 --> 27:31.372
Yeah.

27:33.441 --> 27:34.076
Thanks, Eagle.

27:35.310 --> 27:38.012
We'll bring more clean water
on our way back, I promise.

27:40.915 --> 27:41.749
Sure.

28:28.727 --> 28:29.561
Here?

28:31.063 --> 28:32.062
I don't wanna get
too far off the road,

28:32.064 --> 28:33.532
in case we've gotta bolt.

28:46.711 --> 28:49.612
I haven't seen a night this
clear over the grid in years.

28:49.614 --> 28:51.914
Yeah, well, it
doesn't help us any.

28:51.916 --> 28:53.885
Speaking of not
helping, get your side.

28:55.653 --> 28:57.887
That's a big fucking tarp.

28:57.889 --> 28:59.157
It's a
big fucking car.

29:03.227 --> 29:05.227
Is this
seriously all we're doing?

29:05.229 --> 29:06.862
Well, as
long as the Jacks

29:06.864 --> 29:08.732
don't have thermal
tracking, yeah.

29:11.202 --> 29:12.036
I gotta piss.

29:47.670 --> 29:48.472
Shit.

29:58.214 --> 29:59.015
Get his gun.

30:03.185 --> 30:04.986
Come on, man,
those are expensive.

30:06.188 --> 30:08.221
You won't be finishing it.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.224
Where's the cargo?

30:10.359 --> 30:12.258
I asked you where the cargo was.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.960
We haven't
picked up yet.

30:13.962 --> 30:14.796
Bullshit.

30:16.731 --> 30:17.665
I'll check the car.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.178
Just a tremor, boys, stay sharp.

30:37.985 --> 30:39.618
What the fuck?

31:11.084 --> 31:11.918
Shit.

31:13.885 --> 31:15.186
Little help.

31:15.188 --> 31:16.886
Give me a sec.

31:16.888 --> 31:18.324
Don't have one.

31:41.179 --> 31:42.245
Thanks.

31:42.247 --> 31:43.745
It wasn't me.

31:43.747 --> 31:45.182
It was me.

31:48.119 --> 31:49.751
North?

31:49.753 --> 31:50.921
Hey, Campbell.

31:52.690 --> 31:54.723
You're our Overwatch?

31:54.725 --> 31:55.893
Off the books.

31:56.961 --> 31:58.693
And you knew about this?

31:58.695 --> 31:59.696
Called her.

32:00.797 --> 32:02.266
Jesus Christ.

32:03.933 --> 32:05.100
You've gotta get moving
if you're gonna make it

32:05.102 --> 32:06.268
to the border.

32:06.270 --> 32:08.437
We can keep D22 fairly
clear from here.

32:08.439 --> 32:11.172
North, sorry to
break up the family reunion.

32:11.174 --> 32:13.307
I'm getting a decent
amount of radiation

32:13.309 --> 32:16.679
coming from that beautiful
vehicle they're driving.

32:18.848 --> 32:20.348
Resistant.

32:20.350 --> 32:21.351
Not proof.

32:22.318 --> 32:24.852
Owl, what kind of a
leak are we looking at?

32:24.854 --> 32:26.220
Yeah, there's a breach.

32:26.222 --> 32:28.089
Since I'm guessing
they can hear me,

32:28.091 --> 32:30.757
I should say it's
nonlethal, probably.

32:30.759 --> 32:32.661
All right, you two
have to move now.

32:37.933 --> 32:40.133
What do you expect me to say?

32:40.135 --> 32:42.371
I don't want you to
say anything right now.

32:43.906 --> 32:46.842
I'll radio you two from the
grid when you reach the border.

32:48.477 --> 32:50.045
Nice to see you, asshole.

32:54.082 --> 32:54.947
Jesse, I...

32:54.949 --> 32:55.917
Get in the car.

33:02.823 --> 33:04.256
What makes you think
we can trust her?

33:04.258 --> 33:06.825
Jesse, she's your ex-wife.

33:06.827 --> 33:08.761
No one knows the grid
better than North.

33:08.763 --> 33:09.995
With Lazlo sending us out alone,

33:09.997 --> 33:11.830
she's the only one I can
count on to do it for...

33:11.832 --> 33:13.065
For what?

33:13.067 --> 33:13.901
For honor?

33:14.535 --> 33:15.769
For free.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.141
She gave me this to give to you.

33:22.543 --> 33:23.777
What's it mean?

33:25.513 --> 33:26.780
It's a grenade pin.

33:27.747 --> 33:29.849
From the first time
she saved me out here.

33:31.318 --> 33:32.118
That's dumb.

33:34.254 --> 33:35.088
You're dumb.

33:37.023 --> 33:38.091
Pass me the walkie.

33:41.827 --> 33:42.728
Guan Yin, you there?

33:44.331 --> 33:46.364
Have you
crossed the border?

33:46.366 --> 33:47.931
50 miles out.

33:47.933 --> 33:49.434
What's our cargo?

33:49.436 --> 33:51.835
Deke has the
itinerary and instructions.

33:51.837 --> 33:53.971
Yeah, what's our cargo?

33:53.973 --> 33:57.307
You're on a
need-to-know basis, over and out.

33:57.309 --> 33:59.078
What the fuck did
you get us into?

34:21.299 --> 34:22.800
Am I in trouble?

34:26.871 --> 34:29.239
50 miles from the border.

34:31.141 --> 34:35.078
Without incident, they should
be there in a few hours.

34:37.214 --> 34:38.181
Without incident.

34:39.350 --> 34:40.384
Get off.

34:42.252 --> 34:43.954
I think we just
had two incidents.

34:46.356 --> 34:48.590
You better hope
they pull this off.

34:48.592 --> 34:52.159
You know who's on the chopping
block next if they don't.

35:09.245 --> 35:11.578
So was Jesse
surprised to see you?

35:11.580 --> 35:13.949
To say the least,
stubborn prick.

35:15.117 --> 35:16.550
You know, we can't
cross the border.

35:16.552 --> 35:19.386
The nearest crossover point's
30 clicks outta the way.

35:19.388 --> 35:20.222
I know.

35:21.624 --> 35:23.324
We'll watch from O76,
and then pick them up

35:23.326 --> 35:24.993
when they cross back.

35:26.662 --> 35:28.229
If they cross back.

35:30.398 --> 35:32.867
Canada's cannibal
country, don't forget.

35:34.135 --> 35:36.204
Do you think a drone would
last on the other side?

35:38.406 --> 35:39.240
Hmm.

35:40.108 --> 35:40.942
We'll see.

35:58.926 --> 36:00.225
North, Owl, you there?

36:00.227 --> 36:01.993
We're here, Deke,
about two miles

36:01.995 --> 36:03.362
from the border
west of the gate.

36:03.364 --> 36:05.197
Okay, we're approaching,
how's the leak?

36:05.199 --> 36:07.999
Same as it
was, be careful.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.234
Yeah, right.

36:09.236 --> 36:12.069
Gonna put a drone
on you, see how long it lasts.

36:12.071 --> 36:14.073
Thanks, talk to you
on the other side.

36:18.111 --> 36:20.545
Did you pack the drone?

36:20.547 --> 36:22.513
You packed the drone.

36:44.537 --> 36:46.071
We got eyes on you.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.040
Get out of the vehicle.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.343
What a piece of shit.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.315
We've got
water, 100 cells.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.954
The famous Campbell brothers.

37:04.756 --> 37:08.023
Goddam, you guys are
uglier than I heard.

37:08.025 --> 37:09.291
Word's already traveled up here,

37:09.293 --> 37:12.029
you took out four
proud boys last night.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.165
We were ambushed
at Black Lake.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.569
I'm gonna need 100 cells
for each one of them.

37:19.603 --> 37:20.571
Reparations.

37:21.505 --> 37:22.939
We only have 100 left.

37:24.108 --> 37:26.075
You only brought 100
cells to the border?

37:27.411 --> 37:29.277
We've crossed lotsa
times with less.

37:29.279 --> 37:30.213
Things change.

37:31.649 --> 37:32.982
It's gotten worse out here.

37:34.685 --> 37:37.485
And there's a lot less of
you fuckers passing through.

37:37.487 --> 37:39.554
We don't have 400 cells.

37:39.556 --> 37:42.123
Well you better go
back and get it then.

37:42.125 --> 37:42.992
Not possible.

37:47.063 --> 37:48.131
Where you headed?

37:56.205 --> 37:57.607
Don't make me ask you again.

37:59.308 --> 38:00.207
We don't know.

38:00.209 --> 38:01.043
Bullshit.

38:02.444 --> 38:04.711
And I wasn't asking you.

38:04.713 --> 38:05.714
It's true.

38:09.618 --> 38:10.619
It's true.

38:14.823 --> 38:16.525
You must think we're stupid.

38:18.527 --> 38:21.126
We could just let
you cross on foot.

38:22.664 --> 38:24.564
And see how long it
takes before someone

38:24.566 --> 38:25.566
brings us your head.

38:30.839 --> 38:31.672
Stop.

38:33.674 --> 38:35.140
Look under the hood.

38:35.142 --> 38:36.809
Dammit, Deke.

38:36.811 --> 38:37.778
What did you say?

38:39.079 --> 38:40.481
Look in the hood of the truck.

38:41.449 --> 38:42.282
Open it.

38:44.084 --> 38:45.118
Do it!

38:56.763 --> 38:59.065
Thorium cell, we're
picking up more of them.

39:01.101 --> 39:04.134
Take the water now, let us
through and we'll give you one.

39:04.136 --> 39:05.572
We'll be back in a few hours.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.874
We have to come back
through these gates.

39:09.876 --> 39:10.777
It's the only way.

39:16.248 --> 39:17.082
Get the water.

39:18.183 --> 39:18.818
Get it!

39:27.293 --> 39:28.561
I'll be seeing you soon.

39:30.763 --> 39:32.831
If you don't got no
Thorium cell for us,

39:34.667 --> 39:38.069
there ain't gonna be no
prison, for you both.

40:15.906 --> 40:19.774
Lying to those Jacks, I hope
you know what you're doing.

40:19.776 --> 40:20.609
Of course I don't,
but what the fuck

40:20.611 --> 40:21.678
was I supposed to do?

40:27.516 --> 40:28.750
Guan Yin, we're
across the border.

40:28.752 --> 40:30.317
Good
work, Campbell.

40:30.319 --> 40:32.821
Take S64 north, keep in touch.

40:32.823 --> 40:33.654
Copy.

40:33.656 --> 40:34.557
Gee thanks.

40:36.492 --> 40:38.127
North, we're on
the other side.

40:39.962 --> 40:40.928
Owl?

40:40.930 --> 40:42.264
Yeah, we're close.

40:45.368 --> 40:47.168
Boys, we've
got eyes on you.

40:49.404 --> 40:51.337
Okay, here we go.

40:51.339 --> 40:53.272
Welcome aboard Air Owl.

40:53.274 --> 40:54.942
This is your captain speaking.

40:54.944 --> 40:56.442
If you look directly below,

40:56.444 --> 40:58.881
you'll see two dumbasses
headed to their demise.

41:14.328 --> 41:16.996
Hey, eyes on the road.

41:16.998 --> 41:18.865
Just resting them.

41:18.867 --> 41:19.500
Yeah.

41:21.602 --> 41:23.270
This isn't a fucking vaca here.

41:24.705 --> 41:26.304
Steady,
guys, there's a Sino

41:26.306 --> 41:27.608
gassing vehicle up ahead.

41:36.684 --> 41:38.284
Okay, shit got real.

41:39.385 --> 41:41.320
Let's hope you do
better than them.

41:44.257 --> 41:47.493
Guan Yin, on S64, buncha
your dead buddies on the grid.

41:48.494 --> 41:50.196
Check your tracker.

41:54.667 --> 41:55.933
Yeah.

41:55.935 --> 41:59.269
What does it say?

41:59.271 --> 42:02.207
About 20 clicks
ahead, off-road.

42:03.543 --> 42:05.843
Good, proceed.

42:22.027 --> 42:23.695
Something
big dead ahead.

42:39.477 --> 42:41.245
Jesus, it's a fortress.

42:42.546 --> 42:44.480
Guan Yin, you said
this was a pickup.

42:44.482 --> 42:47.750
It is, but I
didn't say it would be easy.

42:47.752 --> 42:49.818
Find the case at
those coordinates.

42:49.820 --> 42:50.921
Stop at nothing.

43:09.339 --> 43:10.505
Owl are you there?

43:10.507 --> 43:11.572
We've got eyes on you.

43:11.574 --> 43:13.007
The area's crawling with Jacks,

43:13.009 --> 43:14.742
so you should
holster your pistols.

43:14.744 --> 43:17.344
One shot, and they'll
all be all over you.

43:17.346 --> 43:19.281
All be all, you get what I mean.

43:28.357 --> 43:29.123
Enter on the west
side of the fence.

43:29.125 --> 43:30.659
There's no Jacks in sight.

43:37.966 --> 43:40.434
I'm gonna sweep around,
see how many I can count.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.773
Hey, don't do
anything stupid, okay?

43:46.775 --> 43:48.041
Me?

43:48.043 --> 43:49.708
Deke, if you can
get through that fence,

43:49.710 --> 43:51.811
go left, less Jacks.

43:51.813 --> 43:53.412
Follow me.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.753
Okay, follow my voice.

44:00.755 --> 44:03.989
I'm gonna lead you to safety.

44:03.991 --> 44:05.891
Only one, a few turns up.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.893
Stop, move slowly and stay low.

44:07.895 --> 44:11.163
Don't make any sound,
okay, look out.

44:11.165 --> 44:11.765
Now right.

44:13.100 --> 44:15.036
Pass the red car, up ahead.

44:15.970 --> 44:16.803
See him?

44:18.105 --> 44:18.972
Okay, keep going.

44:20.874 --> 44:21.708
Turn.

44:22.676 --> 44:24.475
Come on, guys.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.983
Okay, you're clear
for a while now.

44:31.985 --> 44:32.819
Shit, sorry.

44:36.655 --> 44:38.488
This is it.

44:59.577 --> 45:01.211
Nice job, guys.

45:01.213 --> 45:02.179
Jesus.

45:02.181 --> 45:03.846
Now move fast,
you won't have long.

45:03.848 --> 45:04.749
It's your party.

45:08.553 --> 45:10.722
When's the last time
you guys even talked?

45:12.624 --> 45:13.258
Sort of,

45:14.559 --> 45:16.127
drops outta communication, eh?

45:18.830 --> 45:20.528
You deserve better, you know?

45:20.530 --> 45:21.565
Mm-hmm.

45:23.001 --> 45:23.835
It'll be okay.

45:27.571 --> 45:28.405
Good talk.

45:53.763 --> 45:55.765
Hey, stay calm,
Guan Yin sent us.

45:57.500 --> 45:58.534
Where's your cargo?

46:07.276 --> 46:08.144
Give me the code.

46:10.012 --> 46:11.047
I didn't tell them.

46:12.114 --> 46:13.513
You think I'll tell you?

46:13.515 --> 46:14.547
We're you're only
way outta here.

46:14.549 --> 46:15.515
What's the code?

46:15.517 --> 46:16.984
It's classified.

46:16.986 --> 46:18.185
Hey, if we're taking this
thing across the border,

46:18.187 --> 46:20.254
we need to know
what we're carrying.

46:20.256 --> 46:21.888
I'm sorry.

46:21.890 --> 46:22.956
No, you fucking
think you're sorry.

46:22.958 --> 46:25.259
Give me the fucking code.

46:25.261 --> 46:27.162
Man, you don't
need to die here.

46:30.899 --> 46:32.899
Three, zero,

46:32.901 --> 46:35.068
six, seven,

46:35.070 --> 46:36.171
six, one,

46:37.272 --> 46:38.106
five.

46:49.616 --> 46:51.049
What is it?

46:51.051 --> 46:52.551
I don't know,
vials of something.

46:52.553 --> 46:53.819
What is this?

46:53.821 --> 46:56.156
A chemical compound,
from the reactor site.

46:58.325 --> 46:59.324
It's a weapon?

46:59.326 --> 47:02.127
No, it's a cure.

47:02.129 --> 47:03.061
A cure?

47:03.063 --> 47:04.764
For the epidemic, the lung.

47:06.066 --> 47:08.733
We went to the source,
looking for causes.

47:08.735 --> 47:09.969
We found a vaccine.

47:11.738 --> 47:14.605
It's made up of
waste and mushrooms.

47:14.607 --> 47:17.274
Okay, so what's
Lazlo want with this?

47:17.276 --> 47:19.679
It's a pretty significant
bargaining chip.

47:21.180 --> 47:22.081
Bargaining chip?

47:23.249 --> 47:25.783
Do you know how many fucking
people are dying for this?

47:25.785 --> 47:27.784
Holy shit, Eagle.

47:27.786 --> 47:29.253
How do you use this?

47:29.255 --> 47:32.624
It's a shot, diluted,
direct to the lung.

47:34.093 --> 47:35.058
Now kill me.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.229
Please, kill me.

47:37.162 --> 47:38.297
Look, I'm already dead.

47:39.898 --> 47:41.631
If that doesn't make it
back safe and intact,

47:41.633 --> 47:45.237
they're gonna kill
you, and your families.

47:46.638 --> 47:48.604
Shit, Deke, Deke,

47:48.606 --> 47:49.272
Jacks incoming.

47:49.274 --> 47:50.608
We've gotta go now.

47:53.879 --> 47:54.777
Fuck, move.

47:54.779 --> 47:55.646
Let's go, now.

47:57.882 --> 47:59.282
I'm sorry.

48:07.324 --> 48:09.660
Where is it?

48:10.661 --> 48:11.695
Where is it?

48:23.907 --> 48:27.175
I'm gonna politely
say move as fast as you can.

48:27.177 --> 48:28.209
What the fuck do we do?

48:28.211 --> 48:30.244
We can't give this to Lazlo.

48:30.246 --> 48:31.214
No shit.

48:34.317 --> 48:35.716
We gotta get this thing
across the border.

48:35.718 --> 48:37.952
You need to move now,
Jacks on your tail.

48:37.954 --> 48:39.987
They're on bikes
and moving fast.

48:39.989 --> 48:40.824
Shit.

48:42.158 --> 48:44.626
If they're on bikes,
they've got speed on us.

48:47.197 --> 48:48.264
Got another problem.

48:50.166 --> 48:51.365
North, Thorium cell's leaking,

48:51.367 --> 48:52.668
we might not make it home.

48:54.303 --> 48:55.735
Fucking thing.

48:55.737 --> 48:57.070
Try Spanner.

48:57.072 --> 48:58.373
Spanner, you there?

49:00.909 --> 49:02.409
Deke, how's the...

49:02.411 --> 49:04.311
Thorium cell's
leaking, Jacks in pursuit.

49:04.313 --> 49:05.545
10-four, what's your 20?

49:05.547 --> 49:08.115
Closing in on the border,
we're still north of the wall.

49:08.117 --> 49:09.216
Trying to get to Black Lake.

49:09.218 --> 49:10.052
Copy that.

49:12.019 --> 49:13.087
Heading for the grid.

49:14.289 --> 49:15.324
Spanner, Spanner.

49:16.325 --> 49:17.825
North, where the fuck are you?

49:19.227 --> 49:21.762
North, where do we get
off, how close are they?

49:22.797 --> 49:25.366
North, North, where
the fuck are they?

49:26.767 --> 49:31.070
Well lookee here, we found
ourselves an Overwatch.

49:34.808 --> 49:35.642
All right.

49:37.345 --> 49:39.144
Bring them to the wall.

49:39.146 --> 49:40.379
Where are they?

49:40.381 --> 49:41.980
Dropped off, they
mighta lost the drone.

49:41.982 --> 49:43.715
Just drive, our turn's soon.

49:43.717 --> 49:45.018
Deke, do you copy?

49:47.387 --> 49:49.322
Campbell, report your position.

49:54.793 --> 49:55.428
Fuck.

50:18.017 --> 50:19.516
Coming up fast.

50:28.427 --> 50:29.261
Shit.

50:37.402 --> 50:38.203
Shit.

50:49.447 --> 50:52.147
Jesse, that's
the guy that took Jude.

50:52.149 --> 50:54.352
Shit, Deke, get on Suzie.

50:56.053 --> 50:59.488
Hang onto something.

51:15.539 --> 51:18.774
Bikes coming up,
better get up top.

51:27.350 --> 51:28.315
Hurry up!

51:28.317 --> 51:29.151
No shit.

51:40.296 --> 51:41.863
All right, Suzie.

51:50.472 --> 51:53.141
Shit, it's
jammed, I gotta reload.

52:03.518 --> 52:06.151
Deke, fucking shoot this fuck.

52:22.870 --> 52:24.269
Shit.

52:32.178 --> 52:33.612
This is our turn.

52:37.950 --> 52:40.885
They've got the case,
but they've seen inside.

52:40.887 --> 52:43.954
They should be close
to the border by now.

52:43.956 --> 52:44.891
They should be?

52:45.892 --> 52:47.927
You don't have eyes on them?

52:48.628 --> 52:51.329
I'm the only one
fucking working here?

52:51.331 --> 52:53.331
I can't get anyone on radio.

52:53.333 --> 52:55.633
So they could be dead.

52:55.635 --> 52:58.970
They could be, but I think
they are headed for Black Lake.

53:01.507 --> 53:02.341
New MO.

53:04.042 --> 53:05.408
We'll get them ourselves.

53:05.410 --> 53:07.043
Onto the grid?

53:07.045 --> 53:08.678
There's a reason we pay...

53:08.680 --> 53:10.647
This case is too valuable.

53:10.649 --> 53:11.648
If it doesn't get off the grid,

53:11.650 --> 53:14.052
getting paid is the
least of our worries.

53:15.220 --> 53:17.687
I should have set
the fucking tank.

53:17.689 --> 53:18.655
How far are we?

53:18.657 --> 53:19.955
Close, but what the
fuck are we gonna do

53:19.957 --> 53:20.958
when we get there?

53:21.926 --> 53:23.160
They're coming in hot.

53:28.065 --> 53:28.899
Stand them up.

53:30.669 --> 53:31.502
Hey, hey.

53:34.438 --> 53:35.272
Relax.

53:37.274 --> 53:38.242
It's gonna be fine.

53:43.046 --> 53:46.315
You let them know not to
come in too hot, Mama Bear.

53:46.317 --> 53:47.150
Tell him.

53:48.351 --> 53:50.051
Deke, Jesse.

53:50.053 --> 53:52.387
North, what the fuck,
we're close to the border.

53:52.389 --> 53:53.556
The border's blocked.

53:55.058 --> 53:57.191
I have no idea
what's behind you.

53:57.193 --> 53:58.595
They've got us at the border.

54:00.697 --> 54:02.031
Throw a flare up, Jesse.

54:24.386 --> 54:25.354
Hold your fire.

54:44.038 --> 54:45.371
Thought you boys
were gonna put on

54:45.373 --> 54:46.707
a little show for us there.

54:48.075 --> 54:49.275
I don't have a
Thorium cell for you.

54:49.277 --> 54:50.211
Why not?

54:51.078 --> 54:52.713
I lied, it wasn't the cargo.

54:55.048 --> 54:56.148
The ball's on you, kid.

54:56.150 --> 55:01.054
Look, just take my Thorium
cell, keep the truck,

55:02.055 --> 55:03.756
and we'll slide on outta
here with our Overwatch.

55:03.758 --> 55:06.524
Oh, you're gonna slide
on outta here, huh?

55:06.526 --> 55:07.728
Just slide on out?

55:08.796 --> 55:10.997
Yeah, that sounds real nice.

55:14.801 --> 55:16.367
The only problem is
we kinda got used

55:16.369 --> 55:18.038
to having them
around, these two.

55:18.772 --> 55:20.738
They're like family to us.

55:20.740 --> 55:22.273
Am I right?

55:22.275 --> 55:23.207
Yeah.

55:23.209 --> 55:24.509
Fuck yeah.

55:34.253 --> 55:36.553
Why don't you just
tell me what you got?

55:36.555 --> 55:38.155
Seems like it's the
only bargaining chip

55:38.157 --> 55:39.058
you got at this point.

55:41.293 --> 55:42.994
We can't show you the cargo.

55:46.130 --> 55:47.165
Get out.

55:50.168 --> 55:52.270
Campbell
brothers, please come in.

55:57.175 --> 55:57.977
Copy.

55:59.210 --> 56:02.080
Good, nice of you to copy.

56:03.848 --> 56:05.250
Have you crossed the border?

56:06.684 --> 56:09.685
Yeah, just did, headed
for the south checkpoint.

56:09.687 --> 56:12.855
I was starting to
get nervous, Deacon.

56:12.857 --> 56:14.459
You weren't gonna come home.

56:15.760 --> 56:19.829
I do crazy shit
when I get nervous.

56:19.831 --> 56:22.032
Crazy, crazy shit.

56:23.100 --> 56:24.767
Yeah, well, we were chased.

56:24.769 --> 56:26.201
Had to deal with Jacks.

56:26.203 --> 56:31.141
Just tell me, was
the pickup a success?

56:35.712 --> 56:37.144
Yep.

56:37.146 --> 56:37.814
Headed home now.

56:38.782 --> 56:41.415
Why don't you
meet us at Black Lake?

56:41.417 --> 56:43.284
Let us off the grid.

56:43.286 --> 56:45.654
There's nothing for
you at Black Lake.

56:45.656 --> 56:47.889
That wasn't a request, Deacon.

56:47.891 --> 56:49.091
We'll see you soon.

56:50.159 --> 56:51.193
Great work.

56:54.764 --> 56:55.598
I'm a prick.

56:57.533 --> 57:00.236
Prepare your team
for Black Lake.

57:03.406 --> 57:04.239
Double time.

57:08.310 --> 57:10.176
Looks like you're gonna
have to dump your cargo

57:10.178 --> 57:11.212
if you wanna make it.

57:15.918 --> 57:17.152
Jesse.

57:18.386 --> 57:19.919
I got this.

57:19.921 --> 57:21.556
I highly doubt that.

57:27.294 --> 57:28.828
Open it.

57:37.738 --> 57:39.237
What the fuck is that?

57:39.239 --> 57:41.440
They don't tell
us, you know that.

57:41.442 --> 57:42.276
Bullshit.

57:44.511 --> 57:45.346
Careful.

57:47.514 --> 57:48.415
It's nothing, huh?

57:49.717 --> 57:51.683
We think it's a cure.

57:51.685 --> 57:52.553
A cure?

57:54.187 --> 57:55.787
Yeah, but we're not giving
it back to the Consortium.

57:55.789 --> 57:58.255
Fucking right
you're not going to.

57:58.257 --> 57:59.190
Bound these four up.

57:59.192 --> 58:00.959
Wait, you come with us.

58:00.961 --> 58:03.394
You'll have access to it too.

58:03.396 --> 58:05.296
I have all the access
I need right here.

58:05.298 --> 58:07.266
Yeah, but you need a doctor.

58:08.267 --> 58:10.470
Someone's gotta dilute
and inject that stuff.

58:11.871 --> 58:13.306
We got one at Black Lake.

58:15.541 --> 58:17.642
We'll get you off the grid.

58:17.644 --> 58:19.512
Come to Black Lake
and fight with us.

58:20.947 --> 58:22.947
Come get your freedom.

58:32.424 --> 58:34.326
My daughter gets
the cure first.

58:36.728 --> 58:37.562
Yeah.

58:38.463 --> 58:39.297
Of course.

58:54.012 --> 58:56.580
First time your big
mouth's got us outta trouble.

58:58.883 --> 59:00.249
You okay?

59:00.251 --> 59:01.218
Yeah, you?

59:03.988 --> 59:04.622
Hey.

59:07.792 --> 59:10.025
Sure you know what you're doing?

59:10.027 --> 59:12.697
Don't worry, done
more with less.

59:20.303 --> 59:20.937
Deke?

59:22.039 --> 59:23.604
I know, shouldn't be...

59:23.606 --> 59:24.240
It's not that.

59:28.311 --> 59:28.912
Listen, uh,

59:30.580 --> 59:32.379
what happened to Jude
wasn't your fault.

59:32.381 --> 59:33.614
It was mine.

59:33.616 --> 59:34.816
No, Jesse.

59:34.818 --> 59:37.453
No, I shoulda been there.

59:40.489 --> 59:41.690
I knew she wasn't ready.

59:43.525 --> 59:45.627
We started something
real good here, Deke.

59:47.329 --> 59:48.297
Let's go finish it.

59:57.338 --> 59:58.839
Come on, you fuckers.

59:58.841 --> 01:00:00.941
Satellites don't
work on the grid.

01:00:00.943 --> 01:00:02.475
We're taking back channels.

01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:03.709
So everyone make sure you enter

01:00:03.711 --> 01:00:05.711
the coordinates
before departure.

01:00:05.713 --> 01:00:08.314
Remember, there's no
need to take anybody alive.

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:11.084
Just get me that fucking case.

01:00:11.086 --> 01:00:12.754
Let's go, now!

01:00:17.425 --> 01:00:18.657
I don't see
any Consortium cars.

01:00:18.659 --> 01:00:19.494
Let me look.

01:00:20.495 --> 01:00:22.930
They're not there now,
but they will be soon.

01:00:27.769 --> 01:00:28.602
Let's go.

01:00:30.004 --> 01:00:31.005
Come and get them.

01:00:32.472 --> 01:00:33.738
There you go.

01:00:50.623 --> 01:00:51.423
Shit.

01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:53.657
Eagle.

01:00:53.659 --> 01:00:55.126
Deke, what the
hell's going on?

01:00:55.128 --> 01:00:56.428
I'll tell you inside.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.887
It's okay, you're
gonna be fine, okay?

01:01:25.523 --> 01:01:26.622
Is it a cure?

01:01:26.624 --> 01:01:28.124
We'll see, I guess.

01:01:28.126 --> 01:01:30.493
It's a mycelium compound?

01:01:30.495 --> 01:01:31.460
That's what he said.

01:01:31.462 --> 01:01:32.297
Mushrooms.

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:35.164
Okay, let's give it a shot.

01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:36.866
Did they say how
to administer it?

01:01:36.868 --> 01:01:38.703
Diluted, straight
shot to the lung.

01:01:40.604 --> 01:01:41.873
I don't wanna kill her.

01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:44.173
What did you say?

01:01:48.112 --> 01:01:48.912
Test it on me.

01:01:51.014 --> 01:01:51.815
Yeah.

01:01:52.883 --> 01:01:53.917
Test it on him first.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.521
Okay.

01:02:07.496 --> 01:02:08.629
It's
funny, you always had

01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:10.433
such a bleak view of the future.

01:02:11.168 --> 01:02:13.434
And here you are
fighting to save it.

01:02:13.436 --> 01:02:14.137
Yeah, well,

01:02:16.472 --> 01:02:18.007
sure hope that cure's for real.

01:02:19.475 --> 01:02:22.377
And I didn't always have a
bleak view of the future.

01:02:23.579 --> 01:02:26.479
I just didn't wanna bring
any more life into it.

01:02:26.481 --> 01:02:29.183
Doesn't mean the ones
here aren't worth saving.

01:02:29.185 --> 01:02:30.483
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.120
No.

01:02:32.121 --> 01:02:35.057
I begged you to get off
the grid and leave this.

01:02:36.725 --> 01:02:38.992
Without you, we
wouldn't have survived.

01:02:38.994 --> 01:02:41.828
No, you fucking wouldn't have.

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:51.671
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

01:02:51.673 --> 01:02:53.540
Lazlo and his goons
are one mile away.

01:02:55.911 --> 01:02:57.509
Deke, how's it going in there?

01:02:57.511 --> 01:02:59.611
Good, just
getting set up.

01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:01.914
Span, how's it coming?

01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:02.750
Ahh.

01:03:05.986 --> 01:03:07.187
We need more time.

01:03:08.889 --> 01:03:10.557
Deke, are you sure?

01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:12.860
Yeah.

01:03:19.499 --> 01:03:20.533
Ready?

01:03:22.535 --> 01:03:23.170
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:31.778 --> 01:03:33.844
What am I supposed to feel?

01:03:33.846 --> 01:03:35.548
Hopefully nothing right now.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:37.850
Can I sit up?

01:03:39.551 --> 01:03:40.452
Slowly, sure.

01:03:44.891 --> 01:03:46.591
Well at least
it didn't kill me.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:53.665
Come here, sweetheart.

01:03:56.568 --> 01:03:57.267
How's it going out there?

01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:59.002
In formation.

01:03:59.004 --> 01:04:00.772
The charge is set
around the perimeter.

01:04:02.607 --> 01:04:03.807
Don't worry about Jesse.

01:04:03.809 --> 01:04:05.241
He's the best driver I know,

01:04:05.243 --> 01:04:07.980
so as long as the car doesn't
blow up, he'll be fine.

01:04:09.081 --> 01:04:10.313
What are you talking
about, Spanner?

01:04:10.315 --> 01:04:11.814
Where's Jesse?

01:04:13.818 --> 01:04:15.251
Jesse, what are you doing?

01:04:15.253 --> 01:04:17.521
Spanner says the
Thorium cell's unstable.

01:04:18.823 --> 01:04:20.589
Protect the cure, Deke.

01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:22.093
I'll try to buy you some time.

01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:38.608
Incoming.

01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:41.243
Prepare for the
attack on my mark.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:42.877
There's a chance they're
not as stupid as I thought.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:43.713
Stay vigilant.

01:05:02.831 --> 01:05:03.732
Here we go.

01:05:07.636 --> 01:05:08.271
What the fuck?

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:17.545
Hi.

01:05:19.748 --> 01:05:21.216
Can I speak to Deacon please?

01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:24.685
He's indisposed.

01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:28.355
Listen to me, fuckstick,
you're all gonna be

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:31.692
very indisposed if you blow
this, do you understand, Jesse?

01:05:34.028 --> 01:05:36.264
Do you understand, copy?

01:05:40.201 --> 01:05:41.803
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

01:05:47.942 --> 01:05:50.078
Jesus Christ, where
the fuck is he going?

01:05:51.312 --> 01:05:52.146
Fuck.

01:05:53.314 --> 01:05:54.148
Get him.

01:05:55.682 --> 01:05:56.614
Go.

01:05:56.616 --> 01:05:59.050
Deacon is MIA, I repeat,
he's MI, fucking A.

01:05:59.052 --> 01:06:02.421
Take down Black
Lake, kill them all.

01:06:56.474 --> 01:06:58.141
Okay.

01:07:02.746 --> 01:07:04.115
What are you up to?

01:07:06.184 --> 01:07:08.085
Come on, come get me.

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:21.863
You wanna play games?

01:07:21.865 --> 01:07:24.034
Jesse, let's play fucking games.

01:07:26.904 --> 01:07:29.204
Fuck.

01:07:44.954 --> 01:07:46.820
He's turning around.

01:07:46.822 --> 01:07:49.158
Fuck, come on, you
piece of shit, keep going.

01:07:51.427 --> 01:07:52.792
Fire.

01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:25.826
May I?

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:30.231
You want something done right.

01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:58.124
Ooh.

01:09:13.573 --> 01:09:14.872
We all need to move.

01:09:15.974 --> 01:09:16.808
Campbell,

01:09:18.578 --> 01:09:19.810
you alive?

01:09:21.013 --> 01:09:22.913
Where are you, Jesse?

01:09:38.062 --> 01:09:40.231
I'm getting my daughter.

01:09:55.879 --> 01:09:56.514
Kurtis?

01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:02.986
Deke.

01:10:13.897 --> 01:10:14.998
Daddy's dying.

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.437
Shoot me, I shoot her.

01:10:23.939 --> 01:10:24.973
Where is it?

01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:35.351
Give me the case.

01:10:36.251 --> 01:10:37.052
I'll leave.

01:10:37.953 --> 01:10:39.355
No one else has to die.

01:10:40.422 --> 01:10:41.990
Tell that to your friends.

01:10:44.126 --> 01:10:45.625
The case.

01:11:21.562 --> 01:11:22.396
I found you.

01:11:24.398 --> 01:11:27.599
Look at you, you
dumb sack of shit.

01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:29.136
This was so unnecessary.

01:11:30.137 --> 01:11:32.036
Now I gotta kill your brother.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:34.541
And believe me, he's
gonna fucking suffer.

01:11:37.611 --> 01:11:39.011
We're all suffering.

01:11:43.015 --> 01:11:44.451
No one more than you.

01:11:52.091 --> 01:11:54.093
Behind you, asshole.

01:12:27.124 --> 01:12:30.093
You wasted all three.

01:12:31.696 --> 01:12:32.329
Only two.

01:12:33.465 --> 01:12:35.232
The last one's in safe hands.
