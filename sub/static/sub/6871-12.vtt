WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:02.289
<i>[Holly] Before we begin,</i>

00:02.375 --> 00:04.608
I want to make one thing
perfectly clear to all of you.

00:04.677 --> 00:07.111
The information you're
about to hear is top secret.

00:07.180 --> 00:10.014
Unauthorized publication or
"leaking" of this information

00:10.083 --> 00:11.582
would be an act of high treason,

00:11.651 --> 00:13.150
for which you would
be tried and convicted

00:13.219 --> 00:16.087
by a secret military tribunal
and summarily executed.

00:16.155 --> 00:17.755
So no, Miss Poovey,

00:17.824 --> 00:19.824
I don't think a selfie
would be appropriate.

00:19.892 --> 00:24.462
- Okay I'm not. Jesus.
- Why is she even in this briefing?

00:24.530 --> 00:26.097
She's not allowed to go on missions.

00:26.165 --> 00:30.167
Because she always stows away somehow,
as do Figgis and Dr. Krieger,

00:30.236 --> 00:32.703
<i>and Julia gluey-Dreyfus over there.</i>

00:32.772 --> 00:35.806
So this time they're going on the
mission, so we can contain them.

00:35.875 --> 00:37.808
Well, unless the mission
is a softball game

00:37.877 --> 00:40.611
- against Gary's olde town tavern...
- No, it's...

00:40.680 --> 00:42.146
in which case I nominate Ray Pitcher.

00:42.215 --> 00:44.482
- You know what?
- Not because it's black.

00:44.550 --> 00:47.168
You know what?

00:47.169 --> 00:48.819
Lana, he's the one ashamed of
his hand's heritage, not me.

00:48.825 --> 00:51.835
I'm not ashamed.
[crying]

00:51.889 --> 00:55.302
<i>[whispers] Pssst, Ray. 
C-C-Call me.</i>

00:55.309 --> 00:58.429
- Ooh, little "handingo" action.
- [Holly] Ahem.

00:58.498 --> 01:00.464
Time is a bit of a factor here,

01:00.533 --> 01:02.800
so as much as I'd like to spend
the day murdering all of you,

01:02.869 --> 01:04.034
I'm afraid we need to press on.

01:04.102 --> 01:06.937
<i>To wit, this is Dr. Zoltan Kovacs.</i>

01:07.006 --> 01:08.706
<i>Last night in Paris, someone...</i>

01:08.775 --> 01:11.175
we suspect the Russians...
attempted to abduct him.

01:11.244 --> 01:13.577
A high-speed chase ended in a crash,

01:13.646 --> 01:16.647
which left him in a coma
with a blood clot in his brain.

01:16.716 --> 01:18.449
Which matters because?

01:18.518 --> 01:20.618
Because since defecting
to the West 20 years ago,

01:20.686 --> 01:23.621
Dr. Kovacs has been
developing a top-secret process

01:23.689 --> 01:25.222
for molecular miniaturization.

01:25.291 --> 01:26.957
[chuckles] Aren't they
already pretty small?

01:27.026 --> 01:29.593
It doesn't miniaturize molecules.

01:29.662 --> 01:32.930
The process can miniaturize anything
down to sub-microscopic size...

01:32.965 --> 01:35.800
<i>robotics, computers,
video cameras, vehicles,</i>

01:35.852 --> 01:37.067
<i>Even human beings.</i>

01:37.136 --> 01:39.003
- But...
- [Krieger] You maniacs!

01:39.071 --> 01:41.972
You stole it!
You stole my idea!

01:42.041 --> 01:43.574
[overlapping responses]

01:43.643 --> 01:45.976
I've been working on
miniaturization for years,

01:46.045 --> 01:49.480
- damn you, years!
- Krieger, those were shrinky dinks.

01:49.549 --> 01:52.149
[sobbing] It's the same principle!
[sighs]

01:52.218 --> 01:54.852
It is absolutely not the same principle.

01:54.921 --> 01:57.621
Well... [sniffs] 
then I've wasted my life.

01:57.690 --> 01:59.423
And all of my good markers.

01:59.492 --> 02:03.527
But how does it work, this... process?

02:03.596 --> 02:05.162
You'll be given a cursory explanation

02:05.231 --> 02:07.998
- at the CIA laboratory in New Mexico.
- Why?

02:08.067 --> 02:09.900
Well, I assume they
needed a large building

02:09.969 --> 02:12.102
in a remote location
with plenty of parking,

02:12.171 --> 02:14.472
and real estate is a lot
cheaper out in the desert.

02:14.540 --> 02:18.008
- No, not why is the lab in New Mexico.
- Why are you going to tell us

02:18.077 --> 02:20.478
how this super top-secret
shrink ray works?

02:20.546 --> 02:25.049
Because in less than 14 hours,
you're all going to be miniaturized

02:25.117 --> 02:29.587
down to the size of bacteria
and injected into Dr. Kovacs.

02:29.655 --> 02:31.622
[overlapping response]

02:31.691 --> 02:34.225
What if we don't consent
to be Dr. Shrinkered?

02:34.293 --> 02:36.093
Well there's a carrot and a stick here,

02:36.162 --> 02:39.864
the carrot being an one-time
payment of $1,000,000 each.

02:39.932 --> 02:41.532
[overlapping agreements]

02:41.601 --> 02:46.136
- And the stick?
- The stick is this is your last chance.

02:46.205 --> 02:47.872
You people have bungled every assignment

02:47.940 --> 02:51.141
the CIA has given you, so if
you refuse or fail this mission,

02:51.210 --> 02:53.711
I will personally
ensure that none of you

02:53.779 --> 02:56.046
ever works in espionage again.

02:56.115 --> 02:57.448
[overlapping disagreement]
I'm just an assistant.

02:57.517 --> 03:00.518
- No likey.
- Well it's normally the other way around,

03:00.586 --> 03:04.094
but this time, I think I definitely
prefer the carrot.

03:04.228 --> 03:08.504
Not dick, Pam, stick.
Carrot and stick!

03:08.505 --> 03:10.581
Yeah... I know.

in a very short time in which to do it,

03:58.203 --> 04:00.537
so your undivided attention

04:00.606 --> 04:04.841

- Yeah, is there any reason why you can't

surgery without a shrink ray?

04:07.846 --> 04:11.715

Dr. Sklodowska.

- I'm sorry. What'd I say?

05:08.707 --> 05:09.873
I don't know. Something else.

05:09.941 --> 05:11.541
Welcome, all of you,

05:11.610 --> 05:13.843
and thank you for
volunteering for this mission.

05:13.912 --> 05:17.280
- Albeit under threat of death.
- Due to boredom. Come on!

05:17.349 --> 05:19.616
Let's get shrunked up already!

05:19.685 --> 05:21.117
First we need to cover some basics.

05:21.186 --> 05:25.155

Dr. Kovacs and I are lovers.

If that is shocking to you, so be it.

05:27.259 --> 05:29.059
<i>[overlapping support]
That's not shocking at all.</i>

05:29.127 --> 05:31.127
This is Dr. Kovacs' brain,

<i>home to the greatest mind
in the history of mankind,</i>

05:34.132 --> 05:35.699
<i>if not the universe.</i>

<i>This is the blood clot that

<i>But we will destroy the

Dibs on driving!

05:44.142 --> 05:47.677
You have dibs on neither.
Mr. Gillette, who is a licensed pilot,

05:47.746 --> 05:49.245
will be piloting the Nereus.

05:49.314 --> 05:51.281
Oh so I'm good enough
to drive y'all around?

05:51.349 --> 05:54.718
Great. Maybe on the way, we can
stop off down the piggly wiggly.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.152
When this is over,

05:56.221 --> 05:58.154
I really think you and I
should have a nice, long talk.

05:58.223 --> 06:01.558
- I'm sorry. Am I forgetting my place?
- Little bit.

06:01.626 --> 06:04.027
After being miniaturized,
the Nereus and its crew will...

06:04.096 --> 06:06.129
[scoffs] Yes, Mr. Archer?

06:06.198 --> 06:08.264
Yeah, I think I should
at least be co-captain.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.733
I've had astronaut training.

06:09.801 --> 06:12.569
- So what? So did I.
- So did most of us.

06:12.637 --> 06:14.070
Yeah, but you sucked at it.

06:14.139 --> 06:16.172
You kept puking your guts
out on the... [retches]

06:16.241 --> 06:17.540
- the...
- Don't say it.

06:17.609 --> 06:19.676
[chuckling] the vomit comet.

06:19.745 --> 06:23.913
But I kicked total ass in zero gravity,
so I think I should be in charge.

06:23.982 --> 06:25.281
What the hell are you talking about?

06:25.350 --> 06:27.617
I know how to do it... be weightless.

06:27.686 --> 06:29.780
- So?
- So when we're floating

06:29.813 --> 06:31.888
around in this Kovacs guy,
in the submarine...

06:31.957 --> 06:33.790
Have you ever seen a submarine movie?

06:33.859 --> 06:36.693
[chuckles] Oh my god,
"Operation Petticoat,"

06:36.762 --> 06:38.595
"Das Boot,"
"The enemy below,"

06:38.663 --> 06:41.664
"Run silent, run deep", uh...
"Gray lady down..."

06:41.733 --> 06:43.967
- Ooh, "Yellow sub..."
- "Yellow submarine," yes!

06:44.035 --> 06:46.302
Wow, there's so 
many submarine movies.

06:46.371 --> 06:51.775
And in any of them was anyone on
board any submarine weightless?

06:51.843 --> 06:53.910
<i>[overlapping dawning]
...fat joke?</i>

06:53.979 --> 06:56.212
Yeah, plus that time we
were all on a submarine

06:56.281 --> 06:59.906
- and were not weightless?
- Oh, right.

06:59.978 --> 07:03.621
Uh, but this time we're gonna be tiny.
[clears throat]

07:03.622 --> 07:06.390
After being miniaturized
the Nereus with the mission

07:06.391 --> 07:09.159
team onboard will be
injected into Dr. Kovacs here,

07:09.227 --> 07:11.294
as close to the blood clot as possible.

07:11.363 --> 07:14.564
This is because we only
have exactly 60 minutes

07:14.633 --> 07:17.634
before the process wears off
and we revert to normal size.

07:17.702 --> 07:19.202
Sixty minutes exactly?

07:19.271 --> 07:21.171
Yes, I feel like I
was very clear on that.

07:21.239 --> 07:23.273
Our progress will be
tracked in real time

07:23.341 --> 07:25.241
- on a 3-D map of the human body...
- Ta-da!

07:25.310 --> 07:26.609
[overlapping disgust]

07:26.678 --> 07:28.278
Oh my god, Slim Goodbody.

07:28.346 --> 07:32.248
No! No, this is absolutely not
that trademark character.

07:32.317 --> 07:35.018
- This is...
- Michael? [scoffs] Oh my god.

07:35.086 --> 07:39.155
Just a unitard with the
systems of the human body on it.

07:39.224 --> 07:42.445
- On a guy.
- On a guy named TV's Michael Gray.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.094
- What? [clamoring]
- Earballs! Jesus!

07:45.163 --> 07:47.330

- Are you?

07:49.734 --> 07:51.634

07:51.703 --> 07:54.103
Billy Batson, from  
"the Shazam/Isis hour?"

07:54.172 --> 07:55.905
Well, and "the Brian Keith show."

07:55.974 --> 07:58.541
Obviously in "the Brian Keith show."

07:58.610 --> 08:01.611
- Who is Brian Keith?
- Now you're just trying to piss me off.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.746
So what's up?
W-What have you been doing?

08:03.815 --> 08:08.051
- As you see, my good sir.
- Uh... CIA puppet shows?

08:08.119 --> 08:13.621
- Act-ting, you philistine.
- Michael, what are you doing here?

08:13.668 --> 08:15.658
- I...
- How did he even get on the base?

08:15.727 --> 08:18.561
- He said he knew you.
- You let an unauthorized civilian

08:18.630 --> 08:21.598
onto a CIA black site just
because he said he knew me?

08:21.666 --> 08:24.000
Well plus, he is TV's Michael Gray.

may or may not know,

08:26.404 --> 08:28.171

08:31.810 --> 08:33.576

08:33.645 --> 08:35.712
- the word, "shocking" with the word...
- This!

08:35.780 --> 08:38.615
- This is shocking!
- No, that's just gross.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.683
Which is also the word
I think you're looking for

08:40.751 --> 08:43.753
- with your old man fetish.
- Aw come on, they're not so...

08:43.822 --> 08:45.889
That one doesn't even have skin!
[Dr. Sklodowska sighs]

08:45.957 --> 08:49.058
Okay if everyone will follow me
into the miniaturization chamber,

08:49.127 --> 08:50.727
we will now begin boarding the Nereus.

08:50.795 --> 08:52.528
Whoa. Wait. Already?

08:52.597 --> 08:54.264
Yeah. Shouldn't we
learn a little more about

08:54.332 --> 08:57.166
- the mission parameters?
- Oh you absolutely should!

08:57.235 --> 08:58.902
But we're behind schedule, thanks to...

08:58.970 --> 09:02.038
- TV's Michael Gray.
- [Archer] Whoo!

09:02.107 --> 09:06.542
- And...
- Scene! Yes. We get it, Michael.

09:06.611 --> 09:11.560
Scene!
No, you ruined it.

you heard the lady.</i>

09:19.140 --> 09:20.639
We've got no time to lose, so
here are your mission assignments.

09:20.691 --> 09:22.207
- Archer...
- [Archer] Captain!

09:22.276 --> 09:25.577
No you're not. Gillette is the pilot,
and Cyril is the co-pilot.

09:25.646 --> 09:27.146
<i>Well we'll see about that.</i>

09:27.214 --> 09:30.249
Go see about that.
Okay. Pam and crazy glue,

09:30.318 --> 09:32.184
your job is to stay
out of everybody's way,

09:32.253 --> 09:34.153

09:35.723 --> 09:38.791
- Of the ship.
- Well let's keep an open mind.

09:38.859 --> 09:40.426
And a closed mouth. How about that?

09:40.494 --> 09:42.561
- Mmm.
- Just go.

09:42.630 --> 09:45.297
Okay. Lana, you think you
can help Dr. Sklodowska

09:45.366 --> 09:48.434
- with the navigation?
- Well I did get an "A" in college biology.

09:48.502 --> 09:51.838
Oh wow, great. So when we're
traversing the occipital lobe,

09:51.839 --> 09:55.174
you'll know what to do if
the ship is in imminent danger

09:55.242 --> 09:59.511
of phagocytosis by
polymorphonuclear leukocytes?

09:59.580 --> 10:03.126
It actually might've been an A-minus.
[groans]

10:03.284 --> 10:05.250
[Slater] Okay maybe just
help Archer with the laser

10:05.319 --> 10:07.219
- if he ever gets... out here.
- [Archer] Ow!

10:07.288 --> 10:08.687
You two head up to the laser turret

10:08.756 --> 10:11.357
and get acquainted with that bad boy.
[makes laser noises]

10:11.425 --> 10:13.199
<i>[Archer] Jesus H. Christ, Ray!</i>

10:13.200 --> 10:15.782
[Krieger] Speaking of "H",
do you se me in a sort of

10:15.783 --> 10:18.365
Leonard H. Bones McCoy
type of role, or...

10:18.432 --> 10:20.799
- Meaning?
- Harassible on-board medical officer. {*}

10:20.868 --> 10:25.237
- Mm yeah, I wouldn't say on-board.
- Oh man!

10:25.306 --> 10:29.441
So not only am I not going to tiny town,
now I have to execute a guy?

10:29.510 --> 10:32.111
- What are you talking about?
- This big, meaty bastard right here.

10:32.179 --> 10:36.115
- What are we doing, lethal injection?
- Are you... this is Dr. Kovacs.

10:36.183 --> 10:39.034
- This is? Are you sure?
- Yes.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.053
Because even a first-year
phrenology student

10:41.122 --> 10:46.225
could see that this man...
is a cold-blooded murderer.

10:46.293 --> 10:49.061
Phrenology?
Who are you, George Combe?

10:49.130 --> 10:50.729
[scoffs] Man, I wish.

10:50.798 --> 10:53.399
<i>[Archer] Because now I
probably have nerve damage.</i>

10:54.535 --> 10:57.369
[sighs]
I've decided to let Ray drive.

10:57.438 --> 11:00.506
With his racist robot monster hand!

11:00.574 --> 11:04.309
[sobbing] Hand, legs, feet.
I am a monster!

11:04.378 --> 11:07.546
Oh now... come on.
You're not a monster,

11:07.615 --> 11:10.382
you're just different.
Come on. It could be a lot worse.

11:10.451 --> 11:12.284
- How?!
- Well I guess the hand,

11:12.353 --> 11:15.254
or the tissue covering the
bionic part, it would be, I guess.

11:15.322 --> 11:17.256
You know, could've come
from a serial killer.

11:17.324 --> 11:20.025
And then one day soon,
maybe you're shaving,

11:20.094 --> 11:22.594
and you find out it
has a mind of its own.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.292
It's a force of pure evil,

11:24.293 --> 11:27.516
and it starts dragging you
out into the city at night.

11:27.601 --> 11:30.602
Just cats at first. But once the
hand gets a taste for killing,

11:30.688 --> 11:32.738
it's only a matter of time
before you're out there

11:32.773 --> 11:35.574
strangling male prostitutes,
and then posing them

11:35.643 --> 11:39.044
in grotesque and horrific
parodies of Mentos ads.

11:39.113 --> 11:41.580
You know, the freshmaker.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.317
In which case, I guess try to remember

11:45.386 --> 11:50.656
- I was always kind to you.
- Not always. [nervous chuckle]

11:50.724 --> 11:54.526
<i>Miniaturization will
begin in 30 minutes.</i>

11:54.595 --> 11:57.496
And besides, I don't think Ray's
hand is the one that's racist.

11:57.565 --> 11:59.131
- Shock. Nothing.
- What?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.632
[sighs] So, listen.

12:00.701 --> 12:04.603
<i>- I can't. I'm swiveling.
- Yes you can, Archer.</i>

12:04.672 --> 12:06.438
<i>I need to talk to you
about something important.</i>

12:06.507 --> 12:09.642
Lana, what's more
important than blasting

12:09.643 --> 12:12.778
imaginary womp rats in my
imaginary T-16 back home?

12:12.847 --> 12:16.315
- Your infant daughter.
- Oh right. Sorry. What's up?

12:16.383 --> 12:20.085
Well A: this mission feels fairly
dangerous and totally half-cocked.

12:20.154 --> 12:22.254
[chuckles] 
That's normally cock aplenty.

12:22.323 --> 12:24.490
Shut up. 
And what if Kovacs dies,

12:24.558 --> 12:26.926
and the CIA disavows us,
and we're blacklisted

12:26.927 --> 12:29.801
- from intelligence work?
- I'd have a lot more free time?

12:29.802 --> 12:34.689
So your entire career, your entire
personal identity as a spy gone.

12:34.718 --> 12:37.662
- Maybe I finally learn to fly fish.
- That's great, Archer.

12:37.669 --> 12:40.739
- What if we die?
- I'd have a lot more free time?

12:40.808 --> 12:44.143
Well if we do die, I just
want to reiterate that my

12:44.144 --> 12:47.479
parents are gonna be A.J.'s
legal guardians, not Malory.

12:47.548 --> 12:51.517
[sighs] Okay. A: you've made that
hurtfully clear about a jillion times.

12:51.585 --> 12:55.754
B: Ava Jean could do
a lot worse for a guardian.

12:55.823 --> 12:57.368
Really?

12:57.825 --> 12:59.658
<i>[babbles]
Jesus Christ!</i>

12:59.727 --> 13:01.693
I-I'm sorry. I didn't see the child.

13:01.762 --> 13:04.663
Hmm?
 Oh she's fine. She's used to it.

13:04.732 --> 13:07.799
- Really?
- "Then the mama bear said,

13:07.868 --> 13:11.036
"'well somebody's been
eating my porridge.'

13:11.105 --> 13:14.640
- And then the baby bear said... "
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?

13:14.708 --> 13:15.807
- What?
- What?

13:15.876 --> 13:19.738
- I just had the drapes cleaned!
- And then papa bear said,

13:19.738 --> 13:22.314
"Yeah? You just keep it up
because this town is crawling

13:22.383 --> 13:26.051
with goldilockses with hot,
young bodies and daddy issues."

13:26.120 --> 13:27.467
[babbles] Exactly.

13:27.468 --> 13:30.556
Like what's-her-face at work.
[chuckles]

13:30.624 --> 13:32.524
Debbie, yeah.
[babbles]

13:32.593 --> 13:34.393
And as far as I'm concerned,

13:34.461 --> 13:36.628
the sooner she learns about
cigarettes, the better.

13:36.697 --> 13:39.649
This little pudge-pop's
going to need all the help

13:39.650 --> 13:42.601
she can get in the battle
of the Bulge. [babbles]

13:42.670 --> 13:46.305
<i>And C: even if, god forbid
something happens to you,</i>

13:46.373 --> 13:49.741
- I'm gonna be fine.
- So if, say, there's a malfunction

13:49.810 --> 13:52.595
with the shrink ray and the
ship, and everything in it

13:52.596 --> 13:55.380
- gets vaporized?
- I'd just jump out at the last second.

13:55.449 --> 13:59.184
While every single atom and molecule
in your body is being destroyed?

13:59.253 --> 14:01.873
Uh, no. I already jumped out.

14:01.873 --> 14:04.456
<i>It's this new thing
called cat-like reflexes?</i>

14:04.525 --> 14:07.759
So can you seriously not even grasp
the concept of your own mortality?

14:07.828 --> 14:10.596
- Lana, nobody can.
- Really?

14:10.664 --> 14:12.798
Except maybe bears.
[scoffs]

14:12.866 --> 14:15.767
So will you do everyone
a favor and relax for once?

14:15.836 --> 14:17.669
Nothing bad's gonna...
[both yelps]

14:17.738 --> 14:19.071

14:19.139 --> 14:21.306
<i>[moans]
[Archer] Sorry, gang!</i>

14:21.375 --> 14:23.242
My bad. That was on me.

14:23.310 --> 14:26.745
Hey, somebody roll that guy around.
He's... smoldering.

14:26.814 --> 14:28.247
<i>Miniaturization in...</i>

14:28.315 --> 14:30.310

- I don't know.

14:31.752 --> 14:33.418
Probably something about Paris.

[Dr. Sklodowska]

14:45.356 --> 14:46.489
<i>[Slater] Copy that, navigation.</i>

14:46.557 --> 14:49.558
Bridge is online and we are ready
for miniaturization process, over.

14:49.627 --> 14:53.262
<i>- Said your dick.
- That would mean it's too big, dummy,</i>

14:53.331 --> 14:55.231
<i>and so it's ready to be made smaller.</i>

14:55.299 --> 14:56.966
Damn it.

14:57.035 --> 14:59.168
Turret, are you ready to
begin miniaturization? Over.

14:59.237 --> 15:01.886
Yes, if...
Lana, you good?

15:02.006 --> 15:06.242
- [deep breath] Yes.
- We'll be fine, all right?

15:06.310 --> 15:11.195
- A.J. will be fine.
- Just remember what we talked about.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.282
You already forgot.

15:13.351 --> 15:15.384
[chuckles] Bears.
Turret ready.

15:15.453 --> 15:17.853
Roger that, stupid. You
guys ready to make history?

15:17.922 --> 15:19.321
I'm ready to make a million dollars.

15:19.390 --> 15:22.158
Close enough.
Okay, let's light this candle.

15:22.226 --> 15:24.560
What are you doing?

15:24.629 --> 15:27.596
- He said light the candle.
- Not an ear candle!

15:27.665 --> 15:30.266
Well you won't bleed
him, you won't cup him,

15:30.334 --> 15:33.102
you won't divine his humors.
For all you charlatans know,

15:33.171 --> 15:36.238
this poor man is both
phlegmatic and bilious.

15:36.307 --> 15:38.407
- Get out.
- Gladly!

15:39.844 --> 15:43.079
So, hey, do I need to
swipe a keycard, or...

15:43.147 --> 15:47.450
Ow!
Paging Dr. Dickwads.

- Speak for yourself, holy shrink-snacks.
- Yeah, this is kind of terrifying.

16:08.372 --> 16:10.372
So why are you messing around

- Wh... Are you kidding?

16:13.944 --> 16:15.611
It's not about the money.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.935
Pam, we are going on a voyage
of medical discovery unparalleled

16:19.975 --> 16:24.523
in not only the history of mankind
but also perhaps its future.

16:36.968 --> 16:38.400
which I think you'll agree,

16:38.469 --> 16:41.337
is the very embodiment of
Arthur C. Clarke's third law,

16:41.405 --> 16:44.824
which states that any
sufficiently advanced technology

16:44.909 --> 16:46.876
is indistinguishable from magic.

Or, if you like, a miracle.

- I...
- Plus I'm going to use the money

a lifetime to be with him.

19:24.135 --> 19:26.869
fancy-pantsy Ivy League med school,

to some other med school,

19:29.540 --> 19:31.006

That doesn't give you
the right to bully me.

Doctor, please tell me that Nereus
was injected into Kovacs?

19:54.999 --> 19:56.498
<i>- It was.
- Whew, okay.</i>

19:56.567 --> 19:58.233
<i>So we're still okay.</i>

19:58.302 --> 20:00.169
I'm sorry. I should've
finished that thought.

20:00.237 --> 20:04.073
It was injected into Dr. Kovacs,
but not at the injection site.

20:04.141 --> 20:07.843
- What? Well then, where is it?
- His foot.

20:07.912 --> 20:10.846
Wow.
Now I feel like Dr. Dickwads.

20:10.915 --> 20:13.549
<i>Krieger, shut up!
And you, get them out of there.</i>

20:13.617 --> 20:16.285
<i>[sighs] 
We can't. They're way too small.</i>

20:16.354 --> 20:19.088
<i>They'll just have to make it to
his tear duct like we planned.</i>

20:19.156 --> 20:20.856
Is there enough time
to make it to the clot,

20:20.925 --> 20:24.860
- laser it, and still escape?
- I mean, it will be close, but maybe.

20:24.929 --> 20:29.732
Damn it! 
[sighs] So do we tell them?

20:29.800 --> 20:33.435
Well they'll find out soon enough.
And in the meantime,

20:33.504 --> 20:36.438
I'm sure Sterling has
everything well in hand.

20:36.507 --> 20:38.458
<i>[creaking]</i>

20:38.459 --> 20:40.719
<i>[Archer] Goddamn it.</i>

20:42.731 --> 20:46.280
