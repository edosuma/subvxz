00:38.850 --> 00:41.143
Damn. Why can I never
get straight lines?

00:41.263 --> 00:42.636
Ralph Fiennes?!

00:42.654 --> 00:45.939
Ralph Fiennes is here?!

00:45.974 --> 00:47.541
No, I said "straight lines."

00:47.575 --> 00:48.859
I can never get them.

00:52.864 --> 00:55.916
Stan, I've got some terrible news.

00:55.950 --> 00:56.950
For you or for me?

00:56.984 --> 00:58.602
For you.
Damn.

00:58.636 --> 00:59.953
Your mom called.

00:59.988 --> 01:01.672
Hercules died.

01:01.706 --> 01:03.757
Oh. Big whoop, he's
just my step dad.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.759
I barely care about my real dad.

01:05.794 --> 01:08.979
The only dad that's ever
been kind to me is Father Time.

01:09.013 --> 01:11.465
He's been most kind.

01:11.499 --> 01:14.635
Quick, take a picture
before I blow out my rectum!

01:14.669 --> 01:16.186
Aah, too late!

01:21.092 --> 01:22.893
What are they putting him in?

01:22.927 --> 01:26.296
Oh, Hercules always wanted to
be buried in a Spani-coffina.

01:26.331 --> 01:28.499
Oh, that's so jokey.

01:28.533 --> 01:31.802
The eulogy will now be given
by John Stamos,

01:31.836 --> 01:35.489
as famous fictional Greek
character, Jesse Katsopolis.

01:35.523 --> 01:37.791
Have mercy...

01:37.826 --> 01:40.210
on this great Greek
of a man we lost today.

01:43.448 --> 01:45.482
Now, please join me
in the banquet hall

01:45.517 --> 01:47.484
for the Greek tradition
of stealing everything

01:47.519 --> 01:48.869
that's not tied down.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.493
Betty, that service
was straight baller.

01:56.528 --> 01:58.429
It must've cost a fortune.

01:58.463 --> 01:59.897
All of our savings.

01:59.931 --> 02:01.231
Wait, you're out of money?

02:01.266 --> 02:03.000
Well, then you'll have
to move in with us.

02:03.034 --> 02:05.502
Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude.

02:05.537 --> 02:08.872
Besides, I should be independent
and on my own.

02:08.907 --> 02:10.874
That's ridiculous.
You're so old.

02:10.908 --> 02:12.309
Look how old you are.

02:12.343 --> 02:14.778
See?

02:14.813 --> 02:17.080
So old.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.418
Namaste, Lauren.

02:21.453 --> 02:23.086
Very good, Kim.

02:23.121 --> 02:25.622
Shawn Ian, I'm just going
to adjust your arm

02:25.657 --> 02:27.958
to the right a bit--
how does that feel?

02:27.992 --> 02:29.309
Good?
Good.

02:29.344 --> 02:32.279
Okay, now I'm just going to
put my thumb in your mouth.

02:32.313 --> 02:33.380
How does that feel?

02:33.414 --> 02:34.565
Good?
Good.

02:34.599 --> 02:37.167
Shut it down, pack it up.

02:37.202 --> 02:38.702
What?

02:38.736 --> 02:40.704
Pack up your crap; you're moving
to the basement.

02:40.738 --> 02:42.756
My mom's gonna live
up here from now on.

02:42.791 --> 02:44.441
But, Stan, this is my attic.

02:44.476 --> 02:46.443
This is my home.
You can't do this.

02:46.478 --> 02:48.078
Sorry, bro.
Mom's family.

02:48.112 --> 02:50.581
But I'm family, too!
You just called me bro!

02:50.615 --> 02:52.583
Sorry, cuz, I was
just using it as slang.

02:52.617 --> 02:54.468
Let me break it down for you, son:

02:54.502 --> 02:57.604
Family is your siblings,
your kids, or most importantly,

02:57.639 --> 02:59.506
people you have physically
been inside,

02:59.541 --> 03:01.575
either sexually or as a fetus.

03:10.618 --> 03:14.154
You know, this might
be the seventh best bike ride

03:14.189 --> 03:15.489
we've ever taken.

03:15.523 --> 03:16.824
Keep dreaming, Steve.

03:16.858 --> 03:18.592
It's barely top nine.

03:18.626 --> 03:19.593
Guys!

03:19.627 --> 03:22.529
Oh, my God, a downed plane!

03:22.564 --> 03:26.934
We've got to keep it wet
until the tide comes back in!

03:34.492 --> 03:36.126
I wonder what happened.

03:39.898 --> 03:42.366
Well, fellas, I think it's
quite clear what happened.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.870
The pilot's head exploded
while he was being read this!

03:46.905 --> 03:49.873
The script for <i>The Fast</i>
<i>and the Furious 7!</i>

03:49.924 --> 03:52.309
No way!
Look, it's signed

03:52.343 --> 03:54.094
by Randy Scott Knobson,

03:54.128 --> 03:56.697
the guy who wrote all
the <i>Fast and Furious</i> movies.

03:56.731 --> 04:00.534
Steve, this just became
the best bike ride

04:00.568 --> 04:04.838
we've had where we didn't
see homeless people having sex.

04:04.873 --> 04:07.207
So, number six?

04:07.242 --> 04:08.542
Yeah.

04:11.029 --> 04:13.797
Stan, I'm able to live on my own.

04:13.831 --> 04:15.532
This is all so unnecessary.

04:15.567 --> 04:18.101
No, Mom, the Golden Globes
are unnecessary.

04:18.136 --> 04:20.437
Chelsea Handler's career
is unnecessary.

04:20.471 --> 04:22.573
Tucson, Arizona, unnecessary.

04:22.607 --> 04:26.410
<i>Congratulations</i>
<i>Tucson, you've been Dadded!</i>

04:26.444 --> 04:28.245
<i>Nobody's safe!</i>

04:29.847 --> 04:31.481
Who's that?

04:31.516 --> 04:32.833
Oh, don't worry about him.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.168
That's just a nobody
who lives in the basement.

04:35.203 --> 04:36.536
A nobody?!

04:37.572 --> 04:38.805
Who farted?

04:38.840 --> 04:41.174
Nobody!

04:41.209 --> 04:43.126
Well, I gotta go.

04:43.161 --> 04:44.411
Gotta get to work.

04:44.445 --> 04:45.562
See you tonight.

04:45.597 --> 04:47.164
What are we doing?
This is crazy.

04:52.604 --> 04:55.272
"Exterior.

04:55.323 --> 04:56.573
"The streets.

04:56.608 --> 04:57.741
"Night.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.359
"There's not a soul around...

04:59.393 --> 05:02.813
"until the sickest Toyota you've
ever seen slowly pulls up.

05:02.847 --> 05:06.249
"Brian O'Connor stares out
into the dark night.

05:06.284 --> 05:11.588
"The only thing darker: the sick
black tank top he's wearing.

<i>Suddenly, he pulls a gun
out from under his seat..."</i>

05:46.441 --> 05:48.775
Yo, Brian, I've been looking for you.

05:48.810 --> 05:51.128
Heist?
Heist.

05:55.166 --> 06:00.504
Oh... my... God.

06:00.538 --> 06:02.773
We gotta get this script to Hollywood.

06:02.807 --> 06:04.775
The world needs to see this movie.

06:04.809 --> 06:06.927
But first we gotta finish reading it.

06:08.296 --> 06:09.496
"Interior.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.231
"Crazy awesome mansion.

06:11.265 --> 06:15.068
"A ridiculously hot girl feeds
caviar to a Russian bad guy.

06:15.103 --> 06:17.671
There's like a bear or something
chained up by the pool."

06:17.705 --> 06:20.440
Whoa!

06:22.860 --> 06:24.344
Jeff?

06:24.379 --> 06:26.279
What the hell are you doing?

06:26.314 --> 06:27.597
Oh, hey, Mr. S.

06:27.632 --> 06:30.600
Tom said if I helped him move
his stuff back in the attic,

06:30.635 --> 06:32.903
he'd let me take him
to the airport one day.

06:32.937 --> 06:34.621
Roger!

06:34.655 --> 06:38.458
I thought I told you to move
down to the basement.

06:38.493 --> 06:40.794
Oh, yeah, right,
because I wasn't family.

06:40.828 --> 06:43.146
Oh...Did you tell him yet?
Tell me what?

06:43.181 --> 06:46.950
Me and Tom Yabo got married!

06:46.984 --> 06:48.618
That's right, Stan.

06:48.653 --> 06:49.886
I'm your new stepdad!

06:51.923 --> 06:55.005
FYI, Stan, the ceremony was beautiful.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.776
I sang an original song.

06:56.896 --> 06:59.029
People hated it.

07:03.670 --> 07:04.820
Mom, tell me this is a joke.

07:04.854 --> 07:06.287
There's no way you married this guy!

07:06.305 --> 07:07.922
She did.
Now, we're registered at

07:07.957 --> 07:10.291
Crate and Barrel, but if you'd
rather make something,

07:10.326 --> 07:12.343
that would be a lot more special.

07:12.378 --> 07:14.090
But...
I-I don't...

07:14.210 --> 07:16.313
Oh, you want to know
how we met? Sit, sit.

07:16.348 --> 07:20.184
After all this time, I never
get tired of telling our story.

07:20.218 --> 07:22.186
<i>At first we barely even got along.</i>

07:22.220 --> 07:25.189
<i>But then we realized</i>
<i>we had a ton in common.</i>

07:25.223 --> 07:26.724
<i>Like telling this story.</i>

07:26.758 --> 07:28.325
<i>We both apparently love</i>
<i>telling this story.</i>

07:28.360 --> 07:31.595
<i>I thought I was just gonna do</i>
<i>it on my own, but, oh well.</i>

07:31.630 --> 07:33.831
<i>In addition to both of us loving tea,</i>

07:33.865 --> 07:36.550
<i>it turns out Betty and I</i>
<i>are also both huge fans</i>

07:36.585 --> 07:38.602
<i>of laughing while drinking tea.</i>

07:40.856 --> 07:42.490
<i>Tom eventually invited me</i>

07:42.524 --> 07:44.625
<i>to take a beginner's yoga class.</i>

07:44.659 --> 07:50.664
<i>We connected on a physical,</i>
<i>emotional, and spiritual level.</i>

07:54.035 --> 07:57.521
I haven't been this happy
since I was with Hercules.

07:57.556 --> 07:59.023
That was three days ago!

07:59.057 --> 08:02.143
Betty, can you give me a hand
with the champagne?

08:02.177 --> 08:03.944
I'll miss you!

08:03.979 --> 08:05.463
I'll miss you more!

08:05.497 --> 08:06.747
Not possible.

08:06.782 --> 08:10.034
You married my mother
just to get your attic back!

08:10.068 --> 08:12.085
Why on Earth would I want my
attic back if it meant having

08:12.104 --> 08:14.505
to share it with some old
lady I didn't even love?

08:14.539 --> 08:16.190
I'm sorry you don't trust me,

08:16.224 --> 08:17.975
but what your mother
and I have is real.

08:18.009 --> 08:19.577
To true love.

08:19.611 --> 08:21.378
To happy endings.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.647
Oh, you, I know what that means.

08:23.682 --> 08:24.782
Prove it.

08:24.816 --> 08:26.450
Mom, I've known this guy for years.

08:26.485 --> 08:27.685
He's a manipulative sociopath.

08:27.719 --> 08:28.686
Stan!

08:28.720 --> 08:30.204
It's okay, Betts.

08:30.238 --> 08:32.957
Big family changes are often
hardest on the children.

08:32.991 --> 08:34.741
Let's just take it step by step.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.577
You know, Stan, Betty and I would love

08:36.611 --> 08:38.578
to have you and Francine over
for dinner tonight.

08:38.613 --> 08:40.114
Well, you can
just forget--

08:40.148 --> 08:41.916
That sounds wonderful, Tom.

08:41.950 --> 08:45.553
Stan, I think this actually
might be good for your mom.

08:51.243 --> 08:52.576
Ugh!

08:56.665 --> 08:59.099
<i>"Dom and Brian drive</i>
<i>sick convertibles</i>

08:59.134 --> 09:02.470

09:22.574 --> 09:24.842
What the?!

09:24.876 --> 09:26.844
Are you sure you read that right?

09:26.878 --> 09:28.812
Maybe it's a typo.

09:28.847 --> 09:30.514
I'll just flip ahead..

09:30.549 --> 09:33.584
Here we go: "Interior,
garage, night.

09:33.618 --> 09:36.153
"Dom stands
behind a bent-over Brian,

09:36.188 --> 09:39.190
"and Tokyo drifts
into his..."

09:39.224 --> 09:42.610
Oh, that, okay, that scene
goes on for like ten more pages.

09:42.644 --> 09:44.495
Dudes, this script is full of

09:44.529 --> 09:46.263
extremely graphic gay sex scenes.

09:46.298 --> 09:47.665
What do you expect?

09:47.699 --> 09:49.867
The whole lifestyle's fast
and furious,

09:49.901 --> 09:53.470
with the pills and the disco
and the tank tops-- ohh.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.139
Everything's changing.

09:57.642 --> 10:01.946
Oh, honey, it means so much
to me that you came.

10:11.406 --> 10:15.009
Tom likes to say grace before eating.

10:17.245 --> 10:19.747
God, are you there?

10:19.781 --> 10:21.482
It's me, Tom Yabo.

10:21.516 --> 10:23.317
I just want to say thank you

10:23.351 --> 10:25.519
for sending me such an amazing woman

10:25.554 --> 10:27.655
and unbelievably generous lover.

10:27.689 --> 10:30.891
I mean her giving to receiving
ratio is like three to one.

10:30.926 --> 10:31.892
Minimum.

10:31.927 --> 10:33.127
Amen.

10:33.161 --> 10:34.795
So, Stan, how was work today?

10:34.829 --> 10:36.497
Fine.

10:36.531 --> 10:40.501
Stan, you speak up and look at
Tom when he asks you a question.

10:40.535 --> 10:41.969
It was fine!
Okay?!

10:42.003 --> 10:43.637
Stan!

10:43.672 --> 10:45.639
Tom worked really hard on this meal.

10:45.674 --> 10:47.541
Well, it's gross, and I don't like it.

10:47.576 --> 10:49.059
Come on, champ, give it another try.

10:49.094 --> 10:51.278
Shut up!
You're not my dad!

10:53.081 --> 10:54.415
Stan!

11:02.073 --> 11:03.874
Damn mower!

11:03.908 --> 11:05.726
By the size of those pit stains,

11:05.760 --> 11:09.229
I'd say it's half-past
Miller time.

11:09.264 --> 11:10.648
Your mow-stripes are
a little curved, huh?

11:10.682 --> 11:12.016
May I?

11:12.050 --> 11:13.284
Free country.

11:13.318 --> 11:14.818
Mm-hmm... Okay,

11:14.853 --> 11:16.320
I see what's going on here.

11:16.354 --> 11:17.855
You got the left rear wheel

11:17.889 --> 11:18.956
elevated at a six,

11:18.990 --> 11:20.691
but the right is only at a four.

11:20.725 --> 11:21.892
Not your fault,

11:21.926 --> 11:23.761
sometimes they come
off the line like this.

11:23.795 --> 11:25.396
All right, that should do the trick.

11:25.430 --> 11:27.364
I'll leave you to your lawn.

11:40.912 --> 11:43.397
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

11:45.033 --> 11:46.066
No. Stop.

11:46.101 --> 11:47.267
Listen, little monkey.

11:47.302 --> 11:48.636
This is hard to explain,

11:48.670 --> 11:50.871
but sometimes
grown-ups use expressions

11:50.905 --> 11:52.790
that they don't really mean.

11:56.828 --> 11:59.296
I know.
I was there.

11:59.331 --> 12:01.131
I was driving the other car.

12:05.603 --> 12:08.439
So we're all in agreement that
this <i>Fast and Furious</i> could be

12:08.473 --> 12:10.908
the most action-packed one yet,
right?

12:10.942 --> 12:14.712
But Steven, it'll never get made
with all the hardcore gay sex.

12:14.746 --> 12:16.980
That's why we're gonna cut those
scenes out

12:17.015 --> 12:19.183
and deliver the clean script
to Hollywood.

12:19.217 --> 12:21.051
Then this movie will
definitely get made.

12:21.086 --> 12:22.086
Let's do it!

12:22.120 --> 12:23.087
Yeah!

12:23.121 --> 12:24.788
I like it how it is now!

12:24.823 --> 12:25.923
Okay, here we go.

12:25.957 --> 12:29.493
Pull out all the pages
that need to be cut.

12:29.527 --> 12:33.163
Um, what about this scene
where Dom and Brian hold hands

12:33.198 --> 12:35.466
as they enter
the Toyota Service Center?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.267
No, I think that's okay.

12:37.302 --> 12:38.602
We do that.

12:38.636 --> 12:40.571
We're actually holding hands
right now.

12:40.605 --> 12:41.939
Oh, yeah.

12:41.973 --> 12:44.241
What about the scene
where Paul Walker can't see,

12:44.275 --> 12:47.244
so Vin Diesel sits in his
lap and shifts for him?

12:47.278 --> 12:49.413
That's just teamwork.

12:49.447 --> 12:50.981
Okay look, how about this?

12:51.015 --> 12:54.651
If both guys keep their pants
on, it stays in, okay?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.353
Good work, gents.

12:56.388 --> 12:58.288
We were able to keep eight pages.

12:58.323 --> 13:00.190
Now let's take this baby to Hollywood!

13:03.762 --> 13:06.063
Whoa, no way!
Cool car!

13:06.097 --> 13:08.866
It's a 1970 Dodge Challenger.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.317
Socket wrench me, would ya?

13:12.220 --> 13:16.223
Um... my, uh, my dad never
taught me about tools.

13:16.257 --> 13:17.975
I could teach you...

13:18.009 --> 13:19.476
if you'd let me.

13:21.029 --> 13:23.447
I'll teach you how to do that, too.

13:52.043 --> 13:53.527
Here we go.

13:56.898 --> 13:59.316
It started, you did it!

13:59.367 --> 14:01.068
No, <i>we</i> did it.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.211
I hate to interrupt
my boys getting along so well,

14:11.246 --> 14:13.614
but Tom, we really
should hit the road.

14:16.968 --> 14:18.785
Whoa! We almost died.

14:18.803 --> 14:20.237
Where are you guys going?

14:20.271 --> 14:23.841
Mr. Yabo is
taking me to Niagara Falls

14:23.875 --> 14:25.809
for our honeymoon.

14:25.844 --> 14:29.513
Mr. Yabo is
taking me to Niagara Falls

14:29.547 --> 14:30.614
for our honeymoon."

14:30.648 --> 14:33.283
Seriously, that's how you sound.

14:35.153 --> 14:36.403
Niagara Falls, huh?

14:36.437 --> 14:37.504
That sounds fun.

14:37.539 --> 14:39.039
Are you guys taking the Dodge?

14:39.073 --> 14:41.475
Why would I do that, Stan?
This isn't my car.

14:42.777 --> 14:44.645
It's yours.

14:44.679 --> 14:45.712
What?!

14:45.747 --> 14:48.882
Stan, my stepfather gave
this car to me,

14:48.917 --> 14:50.851
and now I'm giving it to you.

14:50.885 --> 14:52.119
And one day?

14:52.153 --> 14:54.254
You'll give it to your stepson.

14:57.742 --> 14:59.560
I'll take good care of her.

14:59.594 --> 15:00.961
I know you will, son...

15:00.995 --> 15:02.796
I mean, Stan.

15:02.831 --> 15:04.565
No, it's okay...

15:04.599 --> 15:05.799
Dad.

15:07.836 --> 15:10.838
You're the man of the house
for the weekend.

15:10.872 --> 15:12.339
Wow.

15:13.775 --> 15:15.592
Wow.

15:15.627 --> 15:17.261
Here, take our picture.

15:17.295 --> 15:18.996
I want to remember this day forever.

15:25.787 --> 15:27.054
See ya, sport.

15:27.088 --> 15:28.388
Bye, Dad!
Have fun, Dad!

15:28.423 --> 15:29.923
See you when you get back, Dad!

15:29.958 --> 15:32.326
Ooh! I should load this onto
Roger's computer as his wallpaper.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.261
Do you think he'll love it?
He'll love it.

15:34.295 --> 15:35.896
I can't wait for him to get back!

15:42.220 --> 15:44.288
Oh, my God...

15:44.322 --> 15:47.858
this was Roger's plan all along!

15:47.892 --> 15:51.295
He's gonna kill my mom
just to get his attic back!

15:53.481 --> 15:56.116
He's getting another toggle coat?!

16:01.918 --> 16:03.785
Roger's gonna kill my mom!

16:03.836 --> 16:05.904
Out of the way!
My family's in danger!

16:13.596 --> 16:15.697
Well? Are you gonna
make it?!

16:15.731 --> 16:17.115
Nice try, boys,

16:17.150 --> 16:19.869
but this is obviously not a
genuine Randy Scott Knobson.

16:20.092 --> 16:24.402
It's missing one key
component: the gay sex scenes.

16:25.492 --> 16:27.753
You see, boys,
the <i>Fast & Furious</i> franchise has

16:27.873 --> 16:32.597
to be written, and filmed, <i>super gay.</i>

16:32.632 --> 16:35.300
The gay undertones are what
create the chemistry and tension

16:35.334 --> 16:37.469
that make those movies so great.

16:37.503 --> 16:40.906
Oh... I always felt their love
went much deeper than cars.

16:41.127 --> 16:44.830
Yep, we shoot everything Randy
writes, <i>everything,</i>

16:44.864 --> 16:47.138
and then edit it down
for the theaters.

16:47.258 --> 16:49.367
Except France, they get it all.

16:49.487 --> 16:52.671
Wait! We have
the sex scenes!

16:55.976 --> 16:59.812
Looks like we're in business, boys.

17:01.114 --> 17:02.982
Yay! We did it!

17:04.150 --> 17:08.671
Come on. Bring it in,
bring it in.

17:10.056 --> 17:12.924
I let him into my heart,
and he betrayed me!

17:12.942 --> 17:15.277
Well, I'm coming for you, Tom Yabo!

17:20.400 --> 17:22.417
Damn it! I'm gonna have
to go for it.

17:26.939 --> 17:29.992
Yes! Yes! The camera is
loving you.

17:30.043 --> 17:32.127
Okay, I need sexier, more danger.

17:32.162 --> 17:34.079
Um, get closer to the edge.

17:34.113 --> 17:35.280
Great! Now move over

17:35.298 --> 17:37.115
to the area without
the railing in the way.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.167
Perfect!

17:39.369 --> 17:41.503
Uh, we're out of film.

17:41.554 --> 17:44.506
Stay right there, Betts.
Gotta reload.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.848
I got this.

17:52.899 --> 17:54.416
It's okay. I can make it!

17:56.236 --> 17:58.087
Whoa, no! I'll never make it!

18:02.359 --> 18:04.376
Aw, man, I wussed out.

18:09.282 --> 18:11.200
Okay, finally got the film in.

18:11.234 --> 18:13.719
Man, that took forever...!

18:14.921 --> 18:16.955
Mom, look out! He's trying
to kill you!

18:16.989 --> 18:18.090
What?

18:18.124 --> 18:19.208
Son, no...

18:19.259 --> 18:21.176
It's true!
I should've known.

18:21.211 --> 18:23.462
Whenever I let a man inside me,
it hurts.

18:23.496 --> 18:25.547
Stan, I'm not trying to kill your mom!

18:25.582 --> 18:27.716
Shut up! I saw your computer!

18:27.751 --> 18:29.551
"How to Kill Your Spouse
at Niagara Falls"?!

18:29.602 --> 18:32.771
Stan, he's not trying to kill me.

18:32.806 --> 18:35.774
Because I'm trying
to kill him!

18:37.794 --> 18:39.027
Mom, what the hell?!

18:39.062 --> 18:41.730
I told you I wanted to be
independent, Stan,

18:41.765 --> 18:43.365
but you wouldn't listen.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.368
So I took out a life
insurance policy on Tom.

18:46.403 --> 18:48.804
What?! Betts-Betts!

18:48.838 --> 18:52.324
It was the only way I could
afford to live on my own.

18:52.358 --> 18:54.943
I can't hold you both!

18:54.978 --> 18:56.962
I just resewed my rectum!

18:56.996 --> 18:59.665
Then save me, I'm your mother!

18:59.699 --> 19:01.083
And he's a nobody!

19:01.134 --> 19:02.818
You said it yourself, Stan.

19:02.852 --> 19:04.887
Tom Yabo loved us.

19:04.921 --> 19:07.055
And you... you used him!

19:07.090 --> 19:09.191
It's okay, Stan.
I used her, too.

19:09.225 --> 19:11.493
What?
For the attic?

19:11.528 --> 19:14.096
No, kiddo.
To get close to you.

19:14.130 --> 19:18.016
And it was worth it.

19:18.050 --> 19:21.236
No...!

19:22.272 --> 19:23.605
Why'd you let go?!

19:23.656 --> 19:26.108
Because I don't think your mom
and I are gonna be able

19:26.159 --> 19:27.659
to patch things up.

19:27.694 --> 19:30.696
And I'd rather be dead than no
longer a part of your family!

19:30.730 --> 19:32.531
I was wrong, Roger.

19:32.565 --> 19:35.701
You don't have to be <i>in</i>
my family to <i>be</i> my family!

19:35.735 --> 19:37.252
Dude, seriously?

19:37.287 --> 19:40.522
I really wish I'd known
before I let go...!

19:43.293 --> 19:45.727
I can't believe he's gone.

19:45.762 --> 19:47.629
He was the best father I ever had.

19:47.664 --> 19:51.099
To your right is one
of the best views of the Falls.

19:52.335 --> 19:54.436
Of course it's not
the original Niagara Falls,

19:54.471 --> 19:57.022
which burned down in 1816.

20:02.729 --> 20:04.229
All these memories...

20:06.266 --> 20:08.500
So, where is Betty now, anyway?

20:08.535 --> 20:10.636
She ended up collecting
the life insurance money

20:10.670 --> 20:13.105
from Tom Yabo's death
and moved to Paris.

20:13.139 --> 20:14.773
Guess she's getting the
independent life

20:14.808 --> 20:16.542
she wanted all along.

20:16.576 --> 20:17.910
Hey, wait, when was this?

20:17.944 --> 20:19.411
We never hugged.

20:19.445 --> 20:20.879
Not yet.

20:23.216 --> 20:25.484
Do you think things
between us will go back

20:25.518 --> 20:28.253
to the way they usually are next week?

20:28.288 --> 20:30.823
I sure hope so.

20:36.079 --> 20:38.080
<i>Une, s'il vous plaît.</i>

20:38.114 --> 20:40.816
Is this happening too fast?

20:40.850 --> 20:43.986
I'd be furious if it wasn't.

20:49.626 --> 20:52.661
Tastes so good.
Mmm, mmm...

20:54.264 --> 20:57.399
Did I miss any  play?

20:57.433 --> 20:59.234
Tons.
