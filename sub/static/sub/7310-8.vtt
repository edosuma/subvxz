WEBVTT

00:05.900 --> 00:08.500
See? Shortcut through
the park will be working.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.200
You just doubled your tip.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.400
It's Kirkland.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.900
No, my car broke down.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
I had to take a cab. I
should be there in 20.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.800
Have Bob start the presentation.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Yeah,

00:22.300 --> 00:23.400
use the laser pointer.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.700
The GAO guys are
distracted by shiny things.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.300
That'll keep them busy.

00:27.335 --> 00:28.335
Be there soon.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.800
Through no, no. Be passing us, already.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.350
What the hell?

00:33.385 --> 00:34.500
Come on, come on.

00:34.700 --> 00:35.700
Go, go.

01:44.142 --> 01:46.007
No, no, no, it is not you, it's just...

01:46.042 --> 01:47.942
well, you know, these
things run their course.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.742
And, well, you

01:49.942 --> 01:52.342
- you must accept it...
- Personal call, David?

01:52.377 --> 01:53.377
Yes.

01:53.642 --> 01:54.707
Go away.

01:54.742 --> 01:55.942
Somebody being dumped?

01:58.142 --> 02:00.642
How do you tell someone you
no longer want to see him?

02:00.842 --> 02:01.842
Easy.

02:02.442 --> 02:04.342
Listen, dirtbag, this is Ziva's husband.

02:04.942 --> 02:07.307
I have your phone number
now. I can find your address.

02:07.342 --> 02:10.241
If you ever try to contact her
again, I will reach down your throat,

02:10.276 --> 02:12.642
grab your intestines, rip them
out and drive over your head!

02:12.677 --> 02:14.242
Lose this number or lose your life.

02:15.242 --> 02:16.242
You're welcome.

02:16.342 --> 02:17.942
That was my Aunt Nettie

02:18.142 --> 02:19.342
from Tel Aviv.

02:19.942 --> 02:20.942
She was trying

02:21.142 --> 02:23.942
to stop seeing her
86-year-old mahjong partner.

02:24.442 --> 02:25.642
Why didn't you stop me?

02:25.842 --> 02:27.042
Too stunned.

02:27.742 --> 02:28.942
Where do I send flowers?

02:29.542 --> 02:31.942
If you ever communicate with
her again, I will kill you.

02:32.842 --> 02:34.342
Is it always this bright in here?

02:35.642 --> 02:37.507
Wait a second. I recognize that look.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.542
You had sex, and I'm
guessing it was with a girl.

02:39.642 --> 02:40.542
No.

02:40.642 --> 02:41.842
No, it wasn't a girl?

02:42.442 --> 02:43.842
No, it's none of your business.

02:44.042 --> 02:46.742
If the probie was probing
last night, I demand details.

02:47.342 --> 02:48.942
Actually it was this morning.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.742
And it wasn't sex, it was coffee.

02:52.442 --> 02:53.442
And it was good.

02:53.642 --> 02:54.942
The coffee or the sex?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.542
It wasn't sex. I met a nice girl,

02:57.642 --> 02:59.042
we're hitting it off, that's all.

02:59.442 --> 03:00.407
Where do you meet?

03:00.442 --> 03:03.242
Moved into my building a few
days ago right across the hall.

03:03.542 --> 03:05.042
Proximity, that's convenient.

03:05.142 --> 03:06.242
Very?

03:07.642 --> 03:09.042
McGee is getting some.

03:09.242 --> 03:10.842
Get it out of your head, DiNozzo.

03:11.142 --> 03:12.842
And gear up, we got a dead one.

03:13.242 --> 03:15.542
You know, repeated head
trauma causes brain damage!

03:15.842 --> 03:16.842
Explains a lot.

03:17.442 --> 03:18.942
Is this side of my head bigger?

03:19.042 --> 03:21.142
Yes, but so is the other side.

03:25.042 --> 03:26.142
Bonnie and Clyde.

03:27.942 --> 03:28.942
Who and what?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.042
It's a movie.

03:30.642 --> 03:31.842
1967,

03:32.542 --> 03:33.542
Warren Beatty.

03:33.742 --> 03:34.742
Faye Dunaway.

03:34.942 --> 03:37.442
It's a classic tale of
crime and punishment.

03:38.642 --> 03:40.542
Focus on this crime scene, DiNozzo.

03:40.642 --> 03:42.042
Nine millimeter cartridges.

03:42.442 --> 03:43.742
It's not a robbery.

03:44.842 --> 03:46.442
Cash box is still under the seat.

03:46.642 --> 03:47.942
Credit cards are here, too.

03:48.842 --> 03:50.742
Rear Admiral Kenneth Kirkland.

03:52.142 --> 03:53.242
Worked at the Pentagon.

03:54.142 --> 03:56.242
The driver's name...

03:56.442 --> 03:57.742
"A-tife"?

03:58.642 --> 03:59.842
Atif Nukunda.

04:00.142 --> 04:01.142
Gesundheit.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.142
Address is listed as DC.

04:05.942 --> 04:06.942
Tire tracks.

04:07.142 --> 04:08.142
Single alignment,

04:08.242 --> 04:09.442
looks like a motorcycle.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.942
Top choice of assassins

04:11.042 --> 04:13.042
who often dump their weapons.

04:13.142 --> 04:14.342
Look, Ziva.

04:16.442 --> 04:17.242
Duck?

04:17.341 --> 04:19.541
Well, this was no traffic accident.

04:19.642 --> 04:20.642
No kidding.

04:20.742 --> 04:22.542
Little doubt they were killed here.

04:23.342 --> 04:25.642
Cause of death, multiple gunshots.

04:26.342 --> 04:28.342
Any one of which could have been fatal.

04:28.842 --> 04:30.642
- Time?
- That's not gonna be a problem.

04:30.942 --> 04:33.442
Onboard digital surveillance
camera, probably time-stamped.

04:33.542 --> 04:34.642
Let's see it, DiNozzo.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.342
- What? There a problem?
- Well, I...

04:38.442 --> 04:39.907
- McGee has the cable...
- McGee.

04:39.942 --> 04:42.742
Normally I have the cable,
but McGee has the other bag.

04:49.642 --> 04:51.742
Recorded straight onto a flash drive,

04:52.242 --> 04:53.842
probably on a 15 minute loop.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.642
Let's see the last recorded images here.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.842
At 9:23, first shot was fired.

05:01.942 --> 05:03.942
Cab crashed seven seconds later.

05:04.542 --> 05:05.542
A turkey shoot.

05:05.742 --> 05:06.742
Fish in a barrel.

05:07.142 --> 05:09.442
DiNozzo, find out where
the admiral was coming from,

05:09.477 --> 05:10.942
headed to, who knew about it...

05:11.442 --> 05:13.042
and if any of those files are missing.

05:13.077 --> 05:14.442
All right, I'll take care...

05:15.842 --> 05:16.842
That lipstick

05:16.942 --> 05:18.342
on your collar, McGee?

05:21.042 --> 05:22.042
Well...

05:22.442 --> 05:24.042
Good for you, Tim.

05:25.042 --> 05:26.042
Good for you.

05:26.342 --> 05:27.742
Just don't ever get married.

05:33.742 --> 05:34.742
Hello?

05:37.342 --> 05:38.742
I didn't order a sofa.

05:40.242 --> 05:42.142
Yeah, that's my credit card number.

05:43.442 --> 05:45.142
Rear Admiral Kirkland's credited

05:45.242 --> 05:47.742
with several innovative efficiency
programs at the Pentagon.

05:47.777 --> 05:49.607
He was involved in
developing the Ready-Rapid.

05:49.642 --> 05:52.742
Deployment model for moving massive
amounts of assets with minimum delays.

05:52.842 --> 05:54.342
Possible target for terrorists?

05:54.742 --> 05:56.742
Admiral hasn't left dry land since 02.

05:56.942 --> 05:58.942
Not exactly a high-value
al-Qaeda target.

05:59.142 --> 06:01.142
Any admiral is a high-value target.

06:01.242 --> 06:02.242
Taxi?

06:02.642 --> 06:05.742
Kirkland was heading from home to
attend a budget meeting at the GAO.

06:05.777 --> 06:06.807
No government car?

06:06.842 --> 06:08.107
Broke down on 14th Street.

06:08.142 --> 06:10.242
His aide stayed with the
car, Admiral called a cab.

06:10.277 --> 06:11.407
Why go through the park?

06:11.442 --> 06:12.907
Three car pile-up on Connecticut.

06:12.942 --> 06:15.042
The cabdriver was probably
trying to make up time.

06:15.077 --> 06:16.077
Sabotage?

06:16.142 --> 06:18.007
No, we checked the
Pentagon surveillance tapes.

06:18.042 --> 06:20.142
Nobody touched the car
before it left to pick him up.

06:20.177 --> 06:20.807
Files?

06:20.842 --> 06:22.653
Staff checked his briefcase.
Nothing was missing.

06:22.677 --> 06:23.607
Personal?

06:23.642 --> 06:25.842
No enemies, loving family, devoted wife.

06:25.942 --> 06:27.842
No large insurance policies.

06:27.877 --> 06:28.807
No motive.

06:28.842 --> 06:30.542
Every murder has a motive, McGee.

06:30.742 --> 06:31.742
Not this one.

06:42.512 --> 06:44.112
I though you have quit.

06:44.712 --> 06:45.712
I did.

06:45.912 --> 06:47.012
It's no caffeine.

06:47.712 --> 06:48.677
No kick.

06:48.712 --> 06:51.712
I can suck down, like an half dozen
of these babies, no ill effects.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.112
Gibbs,

06:53.212 --> 06:54.412
I'm steel.

06:57.612 --> 06:59.712
No, I am okay. I'm better than okay.

06:59.912 --> 07:01.412
Way better. From the taxi.

07:01.447 --> 07:02.447
Bullets,

07:02.812 --> 07:04.777
the slug on the right
is a nine millimeter,

07:04.812 --> 07:06.912
full metal jacket, high
velocity, you can see by its

07:06.947 --> 07:08.812
deformation that it went
through metal, glass,

07:08.847 --> 07:10.612
- whole she-bang.
- The other one?

07:10.812 --> 07:11.977
Also nine millimeter.

07:12.012 --> 07:13.477
But just a standard hollow-point.

07:13.512 --> 07:16.312
The striations on the rounds indicate
that they were using silencers.

07:16.347 --> 07:17.277
Casings?

07:17.312 --> 07:18.477
Ejection port marks

07:18.512 --> 07:21.012
show that you're looking
for a Glock or a Beretta.

07:21.412 --> 07:22.812
You should really try this, Gibbs.

07:22.847 --> 07:24.012
It'll change your life.

07:24.112 --> 07:25.112
Motorcycle?

07:26.912 --> 07:30.212
The tread on the bike was
only offered as an option

07:30.247 --> 07:32.379
on the Yamaha R-six series.

07:32.414 --> 07:34.512
No hits on sales records yet,

07:34.612 --> 07:37.012
indicating that the bike may
have been purchased overseas

07:37.047 --> 07:38.512
and then brought across the border.

07:38.612 --> 07:39.577
All that,

07:39.612 --> 07:41.312
- no caffeine.
- Crime scene?

07:41.612 --> 07:43.312
I'm working on some fresh oil drops

07:43.412 --> 07:45.012
that were found near the tire tracks.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.177
Cab took a detour.

07:46.212 --> 07:47.762
Must have followed them.

07:47.797 --> 07:49.312
Or they could've hacked into

07:49.412 --> 07:51.812
the taxi's on board navigation
system and were waiting.

07:51.912 --> 07:52.912
Ambush.

07:53.912 --> 07:57.212
Okay... can I just have one little
teeny-tiny baby booster sip? Please?

07:57.312 --> 07:58.112
No.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.512
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome.

07:59.712 --> 08:02.312
McGee, garage. Now.

08:02.812 --> 08:05.612
Boss, the navigation system
was definitely hackable.

08:05.712 --> 08:09.212
All they would've need was the car's
VIN number and the owner's address.

08:09.412 --> 08:11.212
They could have requested
a diagnostic test,

08:11.247 --> 08:12.812
then captured and cloned the signal.

08:12.912 --> 08:14.677
- Who hacked it?
- No way to tell.

08:14.712 --> 08:16.812
The signal doesn't ghost,
and there's no recording

08:16.847 --> 08:18.712
GPS markers after the fact.

08:19.012 --> 08:21.012
Does anyone have any answers?

08:21.312 --> 08:22.677
- Ziva?
- No.

08:22.712 --> 08:24.412
Ziva doesn't have any answers, boss.

08:26.412 --> 08:27.377
Yeah, Duck.

08:27.412 --> 08:28.412
I'm on my way up.

08:31.012 --> 08:32.712
You look into the cab company.

08:42.412 --> 08:45.377
Hey, I can't really talk right now.

08:45.412 --> 08:47.712
Sure you can, probie.
You can talk right now.

08:48.112 --> 08:49.077
Go away.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.412
Put her on speaker, probie.

08:50.512 --> 08:51.712
Get out of here!

08:52.812 --> 08:53.812
Probie...

08:53.912 --> 08:56.212
Look, there's something...
Ah, look at him.

08:56.312 --> 08:58.312
He's all grown up
having his first fight.

08:58.347 --> 08:59.212
Now,

08:59.312 --> 09:01.212
where did you get my credit card number?

09:01.612 --> 09:02.912
You opened my mail?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.277
Listen, I need to go,

09:06.312 --> 09:08.612
but we'll talk about this later, okay?

09:09.812 --> 09:10.812
You, too.

09:11.212 --> 09:12.712
I'll see you later, Bumby.

09:14.712 --> 09:15.712
"Bumby"?

09:17.512 --> 09:19.412
Well, we can't all be
called "probie", can we?

09:23.812 --> 09:25.212
What have you got, Duck?

09:25.247 --> 09:26.612
Bullet from the frontal lobe

09:26.647 --> 09:28.512
of your rear admiral.

09:28.912 --> 09:31.512
Yeah, both bodies
received multiple rounds

09:31.547 --> 09:33.812
from a variety of ranges and angles.

09:35.112 --> 09:36.112
Indicating?

09:36.512 --> 09:39.312
The first projectiles struck them after

09:39.512 --> 09:41.512
deflected off metal or glass.

09:41.612 --> 09:43.077
And they were followed by two

09:43.112 --> 09:45.312
close contact wounds with stippling,

09:45.512 --> 09:46.577
indicating

09:46.612 --> 09:48.812
that they were shot execution style.

09:48.912 --> 09:50.112
Okay. That's it?

09:50.212 --> 09:51.212
No, no, no.

09:51.247 --> 09:52.247
Come here.

09:52.512 --> 09:53.712
Take a look at this.

09:55.712 --> 09:56.877
What am I looking at?

09:56.912 --> 10:00.212
Between the second bicuspid
and second molar, lower left.

10:00.412 --> 10:01.412
Missing tooth?

10:01.612 --> 10:03.312
Freshly extracted.

10:03.412 --> 10:05.612
And the lack of bleeding
around the gum tissue

10:05.647 --> 10:07.312
indicates that it was postmortem.

10:07.812 --> 10:09.412
There was no tooth in his throat

10:09.512 --> 10:11.512
or in his stomach, so
he didn't swallow it.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.612
And there was no tooth
at the crime scene.

10:15.312 --> 10:16.412
They pulled his tooth?

10:16.512 --> 10:18.712
Well, they could have
used a pair of pliers.

10:18.747 --> 10:20.912
It's a crude if effective
means of extraction.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.812
Anything taken from our admiral?

10:22.912 --> 10:24.877
No, no, no, no, but I found something

10:24.912 --> 10:28.112
really interesting on
the driver's right hand.

10:39.912 --> 10:40.912
What is that?

10:41.512 --> 10:43.112
Abby ran the analysis.

10:43.212 --> 10:44.612
It's a fingerprint salve.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.512
Invisible until it's pressed on paper.

10:48.612 --> 10:50.877
Fingerprints and tooth pulp DNA.

10:50.912 --> 10:52.712
Two of the best ways to identify a body.

10:52.812 --> 10:55.312
Yeah, your rear admiral
wasn't the target, Jethro.

10:55.412 --> 10:56.412
No.

10:57.212 --> 10:58.712
The cabdriver was.

11:08.484 --> 11:10.649
Dead driver name was Atif Nukunda.

11:10.684 --> 11:14.084
Immigrated here seven years ago
from Burundi, in East Africa,

11:14.119 --> 11:16.284
after his name was found
on a death squad list.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.684
A political refugee.

11:18.084 --> 11:20.184
Employment records
show he worked two jobs.

11:20.284 --> 11:24.084
Cab and pizza delivery
driver, about 85 hours a week.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.349
- Land of opportunity.
- Check his address.

11:26.384 --> 11:28.784
Metro Police have been
there, done that. Vacant lot.

11:28.884 --> 11:30.884
Attacks on other cabdrivers
in the past 60 days?

11:30.984 --> 11:32.184
Already working on it.

11:32.584 --> 11:34.484
DiNozzo, check out the cab company.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.684
Go to, boss.

11:37.784 --> 11:38.784
"Go to".

11:38.884 --> 11:39.984
It's the new "on it."

11:40.984 --> 11:42.584
New catchphrase, just came up with it.

11:42.684 --> 11:44.084
- You like it?
- No.

11:44.584 --> 11:45.584
Cab company?

11:45.884 --> 11:46.884
On it, boss.

11:47.084 --> 11:48.184
Go, too.

11:51.284 --> 11:52.584
McGee, what do you got?

11:52.784 --> 11:55.184
Well, boss, the time-stamped
footage of the killings

11:55.219 --> 11:57.149
enabled us to track all cell calls made

11:57.184 --> 11:59.284
from the park in the two
minutes after the shooting.

11:59.384 --> 12:00.384
Ten calls in all.

12:00.484 --> 12:03.884
One that stands out was a
high-density bandwidth transmission,

12:03.919 --> 12:05.584
almost certainly a video file.

12:06.084 --> 12:07.584
Someone filmed the execution.

12:07.884 --> 12:08.984
Proof of death?

12:09.284 --> 12:11.334
Call was made from a
pre-paid cell phone,

12:11.369 --> 12:13.384
then sent through a
router in East Africa.

12:13.419 --> 12:14.384
Lost it there.

12:14.419 --> 12:15.419
Find it.

12:15.584 --> 12:18.084
Well, it went to a series
of public pay phones,

12:18.119 --> 12:19.349
all of which were answered.

12:19.384 --> 12:22.384
Impossible to tell which line
was actually the intended number.

12:23.384 --> 12:25.584
Whoever these guys are,
boss, they're very good.

12:28.784 --> 12:29.984
But so are we.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.384
Nukunda is dead, Mr. Bayliss.

12:33.484 --> 12:34.584
Oh, my God.

12:34.684 --> 12:35.684
Really dead?

12:35.884 --> 12:36.949
What happened?

12:36.984 --> 12:38.149
Have you not missed him?

12:38.184 --> 12:41.084
No, he works the morning shift, so,

12:41.384 --> 12:42.884
usually he's sleeping all day long.

12:42.919 --> 12:44.084
Where, in his cab?

12:44.184 --> 12:45.884
In his apartment.

12:46.084 --> 12:47.684
- Fake address.
- Really?

12:48.584 --> 12:49.584
That is weird.

12:50.084 --> 12:51.684
You know, I can't figure out if you're.

12:51.784 --> 12:54.584
DeVito in Taxi or De
Niro in Taxi Driver.

12:56.084 --> 12:57.584
- What?
- You're acting.

12:58.184 --> 13:00.384
I worked transit detail
in Baltimore for two years.

13:00.419 --> 13:01.419
Come on.

13:01.584 --> 13:03.484
Okay, Nukunda was off book.

13:03.519 --> 13:04.519
Off book?

13:04.684 --> 13:05.749
Off book.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.484
Means he worked for himself,
not just the cab company.

13:08.884 --> 13:10.684
It also means he required

13:10.984 --> 13:12.884
an illegal hack license.

13:12.984 --> 13:14.384
Cause there's a lot of places

13:14.484 --> 13:16.284
that cabdrivers won't go in the city,

13:16.384 --> 13:19.184
so we let the gypsies work those areas,

13:19.219 --> 13:20.684
service the public.

13:20.884 --> 13:21.884
Everybody wins.

13:21.984 --> 13:23.884
The dead cabdriver was not a gypsy.

13:24.884 --> 13:25.684
What?

13:25.784 --> 13:27.584
No, "gypsy" means a cabdriver

13:27.619 --> 13:29.349
who works for himself off book.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.584
It's also a great way to
take advantage of immigrants

13:31.619 --> 13:32.949
desperate for work, isn't it?

13:32.984 --> 13:36.284
Dude, look, all I know is that
the guy worked his ass off, okay?

13:36.484 --> 13:37.984
He never invited me to his house,

13:38.084 --> 13:39.484
so I don't know where he lives.

13:39.984 --> 13:41.584
I just can't help you out.

13:42.084 --> 13:43.084
Listen, dude,

13:43.184 --> 13:44.984
every dispatcher knows

13:45.084 --> 13:46.249
every driver

13:46.284 --> 13:48.184
and everything about them, so...

13:49.984 --> 13:53.184
I could have the Taxi Commission
come down here and talk to you guys

13:53.219 --> 13:56.384
cause I know they'd like to meet
each and every one of you and...

13:56.484 --> 13:58.284
- Wait.
- Look, okay,

13:58.984 --> 14:00.284
the Burundi drivers,

14:00.484 --> 14:02.084
they hang out at a little café.

14:02.184 --> 14:03.984
On 18th Street, Northwest.

14:04.284 --> 14:06.184
Little tip: Lime juice.

14:06.284 --> 14:09.084
It cuts that just-barfed-on
backseat smell,

14:09.184 --> 14:10.284
smelly guy.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.884
How long have you been in this country?

14:14.484 --> 14:15.484
Why?

14:16.184 --> 14:17.884
Well, you never heard of gypsy cabs?

14:18.184 --> 14:20.284
You don't use contractions.
Assimilate already.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.184
What are contraptions?

14:22.784 --> 14:23.784
Never mind.

14:24.884 --> 14:26.784
There's definitely a photo missing.

14:27.484 --> 14:28.984
Any way to tell what was there?

14:29.284 --> 14:31.984
Would I have you down
here to watch me fail?

14:33.584 --> 14:37.284
Silver bromide particles
on any positive print leave

14:37.384 --> 14:39.449
minute traces on any surface

14:39.484 --> 14:41.484
when they're combined
with compression and heat,

14:41.519 --> 14:42.684
like, say,

14:42.784 --> 14:44.849
a wallet being sat on

14:44.884 --> 14:47.384
for ten hours a day in a hot taxi.

14:48.184 --> 14:49.384
Abby-cadabra,

14:50.084 --> 14:51.584
your picture from the cadaver.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.384
That's sad.

14:55.584 --> 14:57.284
Why would they take the family photo?

14:57.384 --> 14:59.684
More proof they got the
right guy. Any good news?

14:59.719 --> 15:01.349
Yes, the oil,

15:01.384 --> 15:03.484
not from the taxi but
from the motorcycle.

15:03.584 --> 15:06.784
I was able to determine the
exact viscosity and degradation,

15:06.884 --> 15:08.884
and I found microscopic
metal shavings in it.

15:08.919 --> 15:09.919
Trace the bike?

15:10.084 --> 15:11.084
Well, not exactly.

15:11.284 --> 15:12.884
Well, actually, not at all,

15:12.984 --> 15:14.649
but if you find the motorcycle,

15:14.684 --> 15:16.784
then I can positively place
it at the murder scene.

15:16.819 --> 15:18.084
Unless they change the oil.

15:19.584 --> 15:20.984
Unless they change the oil.

15:23.484 --> 15:25.584
This is a gift for you. It's decaf.

15:26.584 --> 15:27.784
I sleep at night.

15:27.984 --> 15:29.484
I actually eat food.

15:29.584 --> 15:31.684
It is so weird, you've got to try it.

15:32.984 --> 15:33.984
Abs.

15:36.384 --> 15:37.884
Don't let that hurt your feelings.

15:54.284 --> 15:55.884
You speak Burundi?

15:56.084 --> 15:58.384
The official language
is Kirundi and French.

15:59.484 --> 16:00.984
But these people speak English.

16:01.384 --> 16:03.584
They just don't want
to speak it with us.

16:05.484 --> 16:06.584
NCIS.

16:07.584 --> 16:08.684
Federal agents.

16:13.984 --> 16:16.584
Looking for anybody who knows this man,

16:16.784 --> 16:17.884
his family,

16:18.184 --> 16:19.384
where he lives.

16:21.884 --> 16:23.484
I take it this is the hack section.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.284
I'm just guessing,

16:25.584 --> 16:27.384
and your work visas are in order,

16:27.684 --> 16:29.484
cause I hate paperwork, so...

16:29.584 --> 16:31.184
how about a little help here?

16:31.219 --> 16:32.784
May I see the photograph, please?

16:36.984 --> 16:38.884
I know the man you're looking for,

16:39.584 --> 16:41.484
but his name is not Nukunda.

16:43.384 --> 16:44.784
You must forgive them.

16:44.984 --> 16:46.484
Where they come from, agents

16:46.584 --> 16:48.484
of the government
seldom bring good news.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.684
Well, we have questions.

16:50.784 --> 16:51.784
Even worse.

16:52.784 --> 16:53.884
These are delicious.

16:54.384 --> 16:56.684
Then I won't tell you
what they are made from.

17:00.984 --> 17:02.084
Mr. Abaka,

17:02.984 --> 17:04.284
you say you're a professor?

17:04.483 --> 17:06.084
At Waverly University.

17:06.184 --> 17:07.884
I teach African Studies there.

17:09.384 --> 17:10.983
How long have you been in this country?

17:11.019 --> 17:12.084
Seven years.

17:12.584 --> 17:14.049
Same as our dead cabdriver.

17:14.084 --> 17:16.084
The same as many people in here.

17:16.483 --> 17:18.584
It was a time of unrest

17:18.784 --> 17:20.584
and upheaval in the region.

17:20.983 --> 17:22.384
Thousands of us came here

17:22.483 --> 17:24.184
looking for freedom and safety.

17:25.084 --> 17:26.284
It is unfortunate

17:26.784 --> 17:29.784
that this man and his
family only found death.

17:30.284 --> 17:32.284
Someone must know where his family is.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.084
If they are in hiding, no.

17:36.284 --> 17:37.384
What's his real name?

17:37.484 --> 17:38.484
I don't know.

17:39.484 --> 17:41.084
We keep secrets

17:41.384 --> 17:43.584
because secrets keep us alive.

17:44.584 --> 17:46.684
We don't put people in
jail for cooperating,

17:46.784 --> 17:48.684
but we do put them in
jail for not cooperating.

17:49.184 --> 17:51.284
I have been tortured in prison.

17:51.384 --> 17:53.884
I am not afraid of your legal system.

17:54.784 --> 17:56.284
How do you feel about deportation?

17:56.384 --> 17:57.384
Tony.

17:57.984 --> 17:59.484
I will ask,

18:00.984 --> 18:01.949
but it is not

18:01.984 --> 18:04.384
in their culture to
cooperate with the government.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.684
They are too afraid.

18:09.584 --> 18:12.284
He is lying about something.
He looked suspicious.

18:12.584 --> 18:14.084
They all looked suspicious.

18:14.984 --> 18:16.284
I'm surprised you could

18:16.319 --> 18:17.584
understand him, Ziva.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.684
He spoke perfect English.

18:22.484 --> 18:23.584
You are xenophobic.

18:23.784 --> 18:25.084
I am not Xena-phobic

18:25.284 --> 18:26.684
it's one of my favorite shows.

18:26.884 --> 18:27.949
Leather skirts,

18:27.984 --> 18:29.984
lesbian sword fighting,
female empowerment.

18:30.384 --> 18:32.484
Maybe I'm a little Ziva-phobic.

18:33.484 --> 18:34.884
Do you see what I see?

18:35.384 --> 18:36.684
A crazy Israeli chick with

18:36.784 --> 18:37.884
impulse issues?

18:38.384 --> 18:39.484
The reflection.

18:41.984 --> 18:43.684
We could go ask him who he's calling.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.484
Or we can have McGee ask for us.

18:51.284 --> 18:52.849
Okay, triangulating all traffic

18:52.884 --> 18:54.934
from the towers closest to Café Butu,

18:54.969 --> 18:56.984
narrowing it down to all outgoing calls

18:57.019 --> 18:58.484
the time Abaka made his call.

18:58.519 --> 18:59.784
Less narration, McGee.

18:59.884 --> 19:00.984
Tracing.

19:02.384 --> 19:03.484
Look at that.

19:04.484 --> 19:05.484
It's incredible.

19:05.684 --> 19:08.984
Probie's lips are still
moving while he's working.

19:09.884 --> 19:13.284
He's like one of those Romanian
orphans who can't stop rocking.

19:13.684 --> 19:14.984
You are so prejudiced.

19:15.884 --> 19:16.884
I am not.

19:18.084 --> 19:19.084
I'm not.

19:19.384 --> 19:21.384
By the way, that's a contraction: "I'm."

19:21.484 --> 19:22.984
You should try it sometime.

19:23.184 --> 19:24.284
Got it.

19:25.184 --> 19:27.184
Beat my old record by two seconds.

19:29.784 --> 19:31.984
Cell number is listed to Delphin.

19:32.084 --> 19:33.384
Abaka of Georgetown.

19:33.584 --> 19:34.584
Who'd he call?

19:36.184 --> 19:38.684
The Wilmont Hotel, room 234.

19:39.184 --> 19:41.584
Currently occupied by a Sayda Zuri.

19:41.984 --> 19:43.049
African.

19:43.084 --> 19:44.584
Accessing immigration files.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.984
Probably Burundian.

19:46.284 --> 19:47.584
Cabdriver's wife maybe?

19:49.184 --> 19:51.484
She came through
Customs two days ago from

19:51.519 --> 19:52.549
Burundi.

19:52.584 --> 19:53.784
Restricted travel visa.

19:53.884 --> 19:54.884
DiNozzo.

19:54.984 --> 19:56.084
Picking her up, boss.

19:58.184 --> 19:59.184
Found her.

20:03.284 --> 20:05.684
I have come to claim my husband's body.

20:08.384 --> 20:10.084
His name is Thomas.

20:10.984 --> 20:12.384
Thomas Zuri.

20:13.784 --> 20:15.184
Did he change it when he got here?

20:15.584 --> 20:16.684
Many times.

20:16.984 --> 20:19.084
I don't know what he calls himself now,

20:19.584 --> 20:21.484
but he'll always be Thomas to me.

20:23.284 --> 20:25.484
You said he came from
Burundi seven years ago?

20:25.884 --> 20:26.884
Yes.

20:27.084 --> 20:28.949
But according to immigration records,

20:28.984 --> 20:30.884
this is the first time
you have been here.

20:31.284 --> 20:32.284
Why?

20:32.984 --> 20:36.184
The situation in Burundi
is very complicated, Miss.

20:36.684 --> 20:39.384
I have not been free to come before now,

20:40.684 --> 20:42.384
but it seems I am too late.

20:45.884 --> 20:47.584
I am sorry for your loss.

20:50.184 --> 20:51.484
Who told you to come to us?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.284
A friend called me.

20:54.384 --> 20:55.584
Professor Abaka?

20:56.384 --> 20:58.784
He has been helping me
to try and find Thomas.

21:02.184 --> 21:03.384
We are soul mates,

21:03.684 --> 21:04.884
Thomas and I.

21:08.284 --> 21:10.384
Have you met your soul mate, miss?

21:15.684 --> 21:16.784
You will know

21:17.284 --> 21:18.384
the minute you do.

21:21.884 --> 21:22.884
Ziva.

21:23.784 --> 21:24.784
Ready.

21:38.884 --> 21:39.884
No,

21:41.384 --> 21:42.584
this is not Thomas.

21:42.784 --> 21:44.049
Yes, well, there's

21:44.084 --> 21:46.084
- considerable swelling...
- May I see his body?

21:52.684 --> 21:54.384
Thomas was tortured.

21:54.984 --> 21:56.784
This man has no scars.

21:56.884 --> 21:57.884
No.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.084
This is not my husband.

22:01.584 --> 22:02.884
You gotta be kidding me.

22:03.284 --> 22:04.984
$15,000?

22:05.284 --> 22:06.284
$25...

22:07.784 --> 22:08.984
Something wrong, McGee?

22:10.584 --> 22:11.684
Computer glitch.

22:13.884 --> 22:14.984
Better?

22:15.584 --> 22:16.584
Much.

22:17.584 --> 22:19.184
- Where's Ziva?
- Right behind you.

22:19.384 --> 22:21.284
There have been 11 attacks on cabdrivers

22:21.384 --> 22:23.849
in the past 60 days in
the DC and Maryland area.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.684
- Three of them are very interesting.
- DiNozzo, put them up.

22:26.784 --> 22:28.884
All three were shot
with a nine-millimeter.

22:28.984 --> 22:31.484
And all three autopsies
showed a tooth missing.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.884
Enlarge the photos.

22:36.384 --> 22:39.184
Come on. Tell me you just
didn't lose all that information.

22:39.284 --> 22:40.284
McGee!

22:41.884 --> 22:43.084
I hit the space bar.

22:43.284 --> 22:45.384
Just push the buttons I
tell you to push, monkey.

22:45.419 --> 22:47.084
Love is not treating
you well, my friend.

22:47.184 --> 22:48.384
Yeah, no kidding.

22:49.684 --> 22:51.384
Bring up our John Doe from the morgue.

22:58.384 --> 22:59.884
Anybody see what I see?

23:00.284 --> 23:01.349
Black males.

23:01.384 --> 23:02.784
All in their mid to late 40s.

23:02.819 --> 23:04.149
All local cabdrivers.

23:04.184 --> 23:06.084
None of them work for
the same company, though.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.119
Vitals.

23:08.184 --> 23:10.734
Similar age, similar
height, similar weight...

23:10.769 --> 23:13.284
they all have shaved
heads and facial hair.

23:13.784 --> 23:16.284
Bad guys don't know exactly
what their target looks like now.

23:16.319 --> 23:17.884
They only have a general description.

23:17.984 --> 23:20.084
Seven years. Long time. People change.

23:20.184 --> 23:22.384
Would explain the teeth
pulling and the videos.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.484
DiNozzo. How many cabdrivers in DC

23:24.519 --> 23:25.884
fit this general description?

23:28.276 --> 23:29.376
I'd say dozens.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.984
Thomas was a storekeeper.

23:40.484 --> 23:42.684
He had no interest in politics.

23:43.384 --> 23:45.584
But his words were so eloquent,

23:45.684 --> 23:46.984
so passionate,

23:47.484 --> 23:50.084
that his message spread
from village to village.

23:50.284 --> 23:51.749
He became a symbol of hope

23:51.784 --> 23:54.484
against a system of
injustice and corruption.

23:55.584 --> 23:57.784
Extremists saw him as a threat.

23:57.984 --> 23:59.884
Privately, many in the government

23:59.919 --> 24:01.484
did not care if he died.

24:01.684 --> 24:02.984
That was seven years ago.

24:03.584 --> 24:04.549
What's changed?

24:04.584 --> 24:07.184
There is a growing movement
against the old ways.

24:07.684 --> 24:10.384
Some people are openly
calling for him to return

24:10.684 --> 24:12.484
and lead the new people's party.

24:12.884 --> 24:15.484
His enemies fear he
will do exactly that.

24:16.084 --> 24:18.984
I have been told they have
sent people here to kill him.

24:19.984 --> 24:20.984
Came to warn him.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.084
Yes.

24:22.684 --> 24:24.084
How did your husband get here?

24:24.284 --> 24:27.084
He was smuggled out of the
country by your embassy in Burundi.

24:27.119 --> 24:28.584
Our government brought him here?

24:28.619 --> 24:29.619
Yes.

24:30.184 --> 24:32.384
You see, Thomas was pro-American.

24:32.984 --> 24:34.584
That is why the extremists hate him.

24:35.184 --> 24:36.184
Why did you stay?

24:36.384 --> 24:38.284
I could not leave my family, Miss.

24:39.084 --> 24:40.484
My father was dying.

24:41.484 --> 24:43.484
Thomas felt that if he left,

24:43.684 --> 24:46.084
the extremists would no
longer be threatened by him.

24:46.584 --> 24:47.684
He was right.

24:48.384 --> 24:49.484
They left me alone.

24:53.484 --> 24:54.984
A year after he left,

24:55.784 --> 24:56.984
I received this.

24:59.984 --> 25:00.984
No postmark.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.384
It was smuggled to me by the embassy.

25:04.384 --> 25:06.684
He writes that he's
working in Washington,

25:07.184 --> 25:08.284
driving a taxi.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.484
That he misses me.

25:13.084 --> 25:15.084
That he wants me to join him in America.

25:15.684 --> 25:17.984
- And then?
- And then there was another civil war.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.034
I never received another letter.

25:20.069 --> 25:21.784
The embassy could no longer help me.

25:22.484 --> 25:23.984
And now they have come for him.

25:26.584 --> 25:27.684
I know men like these.

25:27.784 --> 25:30.784
They will not stop until they
are sure my husband is dead.

25:30.819 --> 25:32.384
We need something from you.

25:32.484 --> 25:33.584
Anything.

25:33.984 --> 25:35.784
The name of the embassy official

25:36.084 --> 25:37.284
who helped him get away.

25:38.984 --> 25:42.584
Are you aware that I no longer work
for the State Department, Director?

25:42.984 --> 25:45.084
Mr. Choyce, are you aware
that the State Department

25:45.284 --> 25:47.384
and NCIS are part of
the same government?

25:47.784 --> 25:49.984
I doubt if there's anything
I can do to help you.

25:50.184 --> 25:53.284
You smuggled Thomas Zuri out
of Burundi seven years ago.

25:53.784 --> 25:55.284
You set him up in DC.

25:56.184 --> 25:57.849
Gave him a new identity.

25:57.884 --> 25:59.484
Don't know what you're talking about.

25:59.584 --> 26:01.384
Talking about saving a life.

26:01.419 --> 26:02.419
Maybe several.

26:03.884 --> 26:05.149
I wish I could help.

26:05.184 --> 26:07.284
Sit down. You're not done yet.

26:12.084 --> 26:13.484
You're a consultant now

26:13.584 --> 26:15.084
with an Asian-based oil company.

26:15.784 --> 26:19.484
What do you think would happen to
your value in the private sector

26:19.684 --> 26:22.584
if I were to call ZNN, and
tell them you refused to help us

26:22.684 --> 26:25.284
solve a murder of a United
States Naval Officer?

26:25.884 --> 26:26.884
An admiral.

26:26.984 --> 26:28.084
Off the record.

26:29.884 --> 26:31.084
Zuri walked away.

26:31.584 --> 26:32.984
Happens all the time.

26:33.184 --> 26:35.984
Once we get a political
asset into the country,

26:36.384 --> 26:38.484
we hold onto them in case
we need them in the future.

26:39.184 --> 26:40.884
Zuri was very helpful.

26:41.484 --> 26:43.584
But often the assets don't
like the restrictions,

26:43.684 --> 26:45.084
so they leave the program.

26:45.484 --> 26:46.984
We have no control over that.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.184
Zuri left.

26:49.784 --> 26:51.484
That was five years ago.

26:52.284 --> 26:53.484
How do we find him?

26:55.284 --> 26:56.784
Anything I tell you

26:57.084 --> 26:59.784
is a violation of the
agreement we had with him.

27:01.084 --> 27:03.084
I am sure he'll understand.

27:03.384 --> 27:04.884
I don't know where he is.

27:08.484 --> 27:10.084
Last known address.

27:10.884 --> 27:11.884
Look,

27:12.284 --> 27:14.184
he changed his address often.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.684
All I can give you is
where I know he lived

27:17.484 --> 27:18.584
five years ago.

27:19.684 --> 27:20.684
Do you understand?

27:20.784 --> 27:22.484
Stop laughing. It's not funny.

27:22.584 --> 27:23.784
What's not funny, McGee?

27:24.284 --> 27:26.584
- Nothing. Personal...
- Well, don't tell me about it.

27:27.384 --> 27:30.784
I want you to visit the State
Department's strategic analysis unit.

27:31.384 --> 27:32.384
Visit?

27:32.584 --> 27:34.384
I'm going to need clearance.

27:34.784 --> 27:35.784
- Visit.
- Visit.

27:35.884 --> 27:37.584
Visit, that kind of visit. Okay.

27:37.984 --> 27:40.084
- What exactly am I looking for?
- Oil...

27:40.184 --> 27:41.284
in Burundi.

27:41.884 --> 27:44.684
- Don't think there's oil in Burundi.
- That's why I want you to look.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.184
And run this.

27:50.684 --> 27:52.484
Last known address for Thomas Zuri.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.484
Okay, multitasking, boss.

27:56.584 --> 27:58.434
Take my money, take my money.

27:58.469 --> 28:00.284
Take my money. Give me my candy.

28:04.184 --> 28:05.784
You cannot buck the system, Tony.

28:06.784 --> 28:08.184
Trade bucks with me?

28:12.984 --> 28:15.884
If you stop forcing things,
they will come to you.

28:16.784 --> 28:18.084
Thank you, Obi-Wan.

28:19.084 --> 28:20.584
Why don't you like immigrants?

28:21.084 --> 28:22.084
What?!

28:24.684 --> 28:27.484
My great-grandparents
came through Ellis Island,

28:30.484 --> 28:32.484
not the first-class lounge at El Al.

28:33.084 --> 28:36.784
I came here in the jump seat
of a C1-30 with turbulence.

28:37.084 --> 28:38.584
Whatever. My point is,

28:38.984 --> 28:41.184
you're here on a weekend
fun pass. I'm the immigrant.

28:41.884 --> 28:43.784
My family came here with nothing.

28:43.984 --> 28:45.484
Just loads of charm, talent...

28:45.684 --> 28:46.884
and great looks.

28:47.584 --> 28:48.684
My great-grandfather

28:49.284 --> 28:51.084
drove a truck for two dollars a day.

28:51.284 --> 28:53.684
Took him 20 years to start
his own transportation company.

28:53.784 --> 28:56.584
And now their great-grandson,
he's an NCIS agent.

28:57.684 --> 29:00.184
So don't tell me about
the immigrant experience.

29:01.084 --> 29:02.184
Until you are one.

29:02.684 --> 29:03.784
Any of that true?

29:04.984 --> 29:05.984
Parts.

29:07.784 --> 29:09.284
Is this stuck to my teeth?

29:10.284 --> 29:11.484
Nothing sticks to you.

29:22.284 --> 29:23.984
Do you ever think about soul mates?

29:24.584 --> 29:26.084
They were on Decca, right?

29:26.119 --> 29:27.284
Big hit, mid - '70s.

29:27.384 --> 29:28.584
Sort of a disco thing?

29:29.284 --> 29:30.684
Sing a few bar, I'll get it.

29:32.084 --> 29:33.484
You'll never get it.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.449
Boss.

29:38.484 --> 29:41.084
- I did what you told me to do.
- You don't have to whisper.

29:41.119 --> 29:42.349
I don't care who hears.

29:42.384 --> 29:44.084
- You want me to tell you...
- Nope.

29:44.284 --> 29:45.884
'Cause I can give you the short...

29:45.919 --> 29:46.919
Forget I asked.

29:47.784 --> 29:49.884
Classified satellite recon photos

29:50.084 --> 29:52.584
of a petroleum exploration
firm linked to China,

29:52.884 --> 29:55.184
doing drilling in the
Dajee region of Burundi.

29:55.219 --> 29:56.149
Find anything?

29:56.184 --> 29:58.695
Considering the money they're
poured into the region I'd say yes.

29:58.719 --> 29:59.719
Oil.

29:59.784 --> 30:02.384
Guess who still has top-level
clearance in the State Department?

30:03.184 --> 30:04.649
Choyce. Still working for them.

30:04.684 --> 30:06.884
Not as an employee, but as a consultant.

30:06.919 --> 30:08.484
Plausible deniability.

30:08.684 --> 30:10.284
You run that address Choyce gave us?

30:10.584 --> 30:12.484
Yeah, construction site. New condos.

30:12.584 --> 30:14.784
Original building was
demolished two years ago.

30:15.284 --> 30:17.284
Guess Zuri moved on,
found a new place to live.

30:17.684 --> 30:19.684
Four drivers, four
different cab companies.

30:19.784 --> 30:20.884
Nothing in common?

30:20.984 --> 30:22.784
All attacked at different
times of the day.

30:23.084 --> 30:24.684
Time of death of the first driver?

30:27.384 --> 30:28.584
2:30 in the morning.

30:29.384 --> 30:31.384
Which was 90 minutes
after he clocked out.

30:31.684 --> 30:32.784
Second driver?

30:34.384 --> 30:35.884
9:45 in the evening.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.684
Two hours after he logged off.

30:37.884 --> 30:39.984
None of them were working
when they were attacked.

30:40.084 --> 30:43.184
Boss, in two of the attacks,
the cabs had passengers.

30:43.784 --> 30:46.984
In each case, including the admiral's,
the passengers called for a cab.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.701
They didn't just hail it on the street.

30:48.736 --> 30:50.384
Meaning someone had
to have dispatched it.

30:50.419 --> 30:51.749
Even if they was off the records.

30:51.784 --> 30:54.184
Meaning Bayliss, the
cab company dispatcher.

30:55.584 --> 30:57.484
He was working when
every attack happened.

30:57.884 --> 31:00.184
Probably used a bypass
to channel the calls.

31:01.184 --> 31:02.884
Bayliss did not report to work today.

31:03.184 --> 31:04.184
Address.

31:04.284 --> 31:05.384
Yeah, got it.

31:17.684 --> 31:18.884
NCIS!

31:19.084 --> 31:20.184
Warrant!

31:30.484 --> 31:31.484
Clear.

31:31.984 --> 31:32.984
Clear.

31:34.684 --> 31:35.884
DiNozzo. McGee.

31:45.084 --> 31:46.184
Ziva, pick it.

31:46.484 --> 31:47.484
No problem.

31:54.384 --> 31:55.784
Fives and tens. Curb cash.

31:56.084 --> 31:57.184
What's curb cash?

31:57.684 --> 31:59.434
Fares. Small denominations.

31:59.469 --> 32:01.184
- Street money.
- Kickbacks.

32:01.384 --> 32:02.584
Lollipop for McLoverboy.

32:03.384 --> 32:04.584
Those real?

32:09.184 --> 32:10.184
Fakes.

32:10.384 --> 32:12.884
But they're really good fakes.
Guy's a regular cab coyote.

32:13.384 --> 32:15.049
Is that like a wolf in sheep's clothing?

32:15.084 --> 32:18.084
Coyote's a person who exploits people
who come to this country illegally.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.684
As opposed to outsourcing,
which is what you are.

32:36.184 --> 32:37.184
That's Bayliss.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.284
Attic space. He must have been hiding.

32:45.184 --> 32:46.284
Been shot.

32:46.484 --> 32:47.484
Still warm, boss.

33:05.743 --> 33:09.643
Boss, MPD shut down a 12-block perimeter
around Bayliss's apartment. Nothing.

33:09.678 --> 33:11.643
Got a BOLO out on the Yamaha.

33:11.678 --> 33:12.608
Traffic cams?

33:12.643 --> 33:15.143
Lost the bike after three
blocks. He took side streets.

33:15.343 --> 33:16.843
How did they know about Bayliss?

33:17.043 --> 33:19.543
McGee, Choyce's bank records
and personnel file from State.

33:19.843 --> 33:22.543
And find out who the hell
Choyce called after he left here.

33:22.643 --> 33:23.943
- DiNozzo?
- Boss.

33:24.443 --> 33:25.443
Bring him in.

33:28.743 --> 33:29.843
Get Sayda.

33:36.143 --> 33:37.143
Yes?

33:38.543 --> 33:40.543
No, I told you I don't
want to give you her name.

33:40.743 --> 33:42.543
I just want to cancel my credit cards.

33:42.643 --> 33:43.743
58, 59.

33:43.843 --> 33:44.843
60...

33:45.043 --> 33:47.843
Well, why would you send the IRC
after me? I haven't done anything.

33:51.743 --> 33:55.743
Did you know that it's 365
steps from my lab to your desk?

33:58.043 --> 33:59.943
Trying to get my blood pumping.

33:59.978 --> 34:01.543
What's wrong with you?

34:01.743 --> 34:02.743
Nothing.

34:02.843 --> 34:06.243
Okay, this is the new,
caffeine-free, non-jittery Abby.

34:06.743 --> 34:08.342
Still waters. Deep.

34:08.743 --> 34:10.443
You're hiding something, and I seek it.

34:10.643 --> 34:11.643
Speak.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.643
I've been seeing this girl.

34:16.342 --> 34:17.342
That's nice.

34:17.643 --> 34:19.643
No, actually, it's not nice.

34:19.678 --> 34:21.507
She stole my mail,

34:21.543 --> 34:24.943
and took out $65,000 in
pre-approved credit cards in my name.

34:25.643 --> 34:26.943
You have really good credit.

34:27.342 --> 34:28.743
FICO score's 750.

34:28.842 --> 34:29.842
Well, was.

34:30.143 --> 34:33.043
So, this is, like, the
best worst love story ever?

34:33.543 --> 34:34.743
Abby, what do I do?

34:35.243 --> 34:38.743
It's like I'm nuts for this
girl, you know, and she's just...

34:39.943 --> 34:40.943
nuts.

34:41.143 --> 34:42.443
She stole your heart,

34:42.478 --> 34:43.743
she stole your money.

34:43.777 --> 34:44.842
Arrest her.

34:44.943 --> 34:46.643
That's the thing. That's what she wants.

34:46.678 --> 34:48.643
She admitted everything to me.

34:52.543 --> 34:55.143
That is a check for $65,000.

34:55.743 --> 34:58.043
Yeah, her father's Earnest
Leonard. He's worth billions.

34:58.643 --> 35:00.043
She does this for fun.

35:00.543 --> 35:01.808
She's been arrested twice.

35:01.843 --> 35:04.443
She steals people's
money, she buys things.

35:04.643 --> 35:06.043
The crazy ones are the best.

35:08.743 --> 35:10.543
See, the weird thing is...

35:10.643 --> 35:12.043
I kind of dig it, you know?

35:12.543 --> 35:14.943
Love is never having to
read her her Miranda rights.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.543
But she's going to do
this to somebody else.

35:18.043 --> 35:19.943
Throw her psycho ass in the brig.

35:20.543 --> 35:21.643
I love you, McGee.

35:23.243 --> 35:24.543
That should be enough.

35:25.843 --> 35:29.143
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

35:30.243 --> 35:31.443
Shall we try this again?

35:31.943 --> 35:33.243
Has something changed?

35:33.443 --> 35:34.543
You might say that.

35:36.043 --> 35:37.143
Recognize these?

35:38.743 --> 35:40.943
My banking details. This is outrageous.

35:40.978 --> 35:42.208
How did you get these?

35:42.243 --> 35:44.043
Warrant, and this is what we found.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.643
Two deposits. One for $100,000.

35:46.843 --> 35:48.693
The second for $150.000.

35:48.728 --> 35:50.543
From a bank in Burundi.

35:50.643 --> 35:52.408
Now, we're still following

35:52.443 --> 35:55.243
the paper trail, but I think we all
know where it's going to take us,

35:55.278 --> 35:56.343
don't we, Mr. Choyce?

35:57.543 --> 35:59.943
To Burundi political extremists.

36:00.243 --> 36:01.643
With well-oiled pockets.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.643
You sold them information about Zuri.

36:06.143 --> 36:08.343
I want a deal before
I say anything else.

36:09.443 --> 36:10.543
First the truth.

36:10.843 --> 36:13.143
- Then a deal.
- Look, I didn't sell them

36:13.243 --> 36:14.543
anything useful.

36:14.743 --> 36:16.543
It was information from years ago.

36:16.643 --> 36:19.043
Old addresses and phone
numbers, that's all.

36:20.043 --> 36:21.243
He was paranoid!

36:21.643 --> 36:23.343
He moved six times in the first year!

36:23.378 --> 36:25.010
There's no way they could find him!

36:25.045 --> 36:26.608
Was one of these old phone numbers

36:26.643 --> 36:29.343
used by a taxi dispatcher named Bayliss?

36:29.843 --> 36:33.843
Zuri only drove cabs for a
couple of months years ago.

36:33.878 --> 36:34.943
Then he quit.

36:35.143 --> 36:38.243
Wrong. He went gypsy, off the books.

36:39.043 --> 36:40.743
You gave them Bayliss's name.

36:41.443 --> 36:42.543
Bayliss is dead.

36:42.943 --> 36:45.143
Got to believe he told
them where to find Zuri.

36:45.643 --> 36:46.843
My God.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.143
How did you communicate with them?

36:49.443 --> 36:50.543
They contacted me.

36:50.943 --> 36:51.943
By phone?

36:52.143 --> 36:54.043
Pre-paid cell. They called me.

36:54.843 --> 36:55.943
Non-traceable.

36:56.043 --> 36:57.043
I tried.

36:57.343 --> 36:58.343
Name.

37:02.943 --> 37:04.543
Tie him to Burundi terrorism.

37:04.843 --> 37:05.943
Send him to Gitmo.

37:06.143 --> 37:07.743
No lawyer, no phone.

37:08.943 --> 37:11.543
- Good luck with that deal.
- Delphin Abaka.

37:14.943 --> 37:16.043
Delphin Abaka.

37:17.343 --> 37:18.443
No luck, boss.

37:18.543 --> 37:19.643
Abaka's off the grid.

37:19.743 --> 37:21.943
He's a damn teacher
at a university, McGee.

37:22.543 --> 37:24.793
Also served in the
Burundi army 20 years ago

37:24.828 --> 37:27.043
and hasn't been teaching
since last semester.

37:27.143 --> 37:29.643
Guess when he realized we were
involved, he tried to use Sayda

37:29.678 --> 37:31.443
to find out what we knew.

37:31.543 --> 37:33.343
We probably know less than he does.

37:33.443 --> 37:35.943
The DMV needs a thumbprint
to get a driver's license.

37:36.943 --> 37:38.243
Means Zuri's in the system.

37:38.943 --> 37:41.043
If we can match his
prints to DMV records,

37:41.243 --> 37:42.543
we can get his current alias

37:42.643 --> 37:44.208
- and an address.
- That's a nice try.

37:44.243 --> 37:46.943
If Zuri's still out there, he's
got his fake hack license with him.

37:46.978 --> 37:48.408
I'm sorry, boss. I already looked.

37:48.443 --> 37:50.543
I think I know where we
can get a fingerprint.

37:50.943 --> 37:52.143
Sayda's locket.

37:55.243 --> 37:56.243
Scanning.

38:00.943 --> 38:02.543
Let's see what we got.

38:04.343 --> 38:06.443
It's a partial right thumb.

38:06.843 --> 38:08.543
Degraded by age, but...

38:08.843 --> 38:11.343
I have enough whirls and
deltas to get eight points.

38:11.743 --> 38:13.343
How long is this going to take, madam?

38:13.743 --> 38:16.043
- You know what? It's hard to tell.
- Tell, Abby.

38:16.443 --> 38:18.143
Somebody needs to switch to decaf.

38:18.643 --> 38:20.143
Could be seconds, could be hours

38:20.243 --> 38:23.043
if he used his other thumb
for his driver's license.

38:25.043 --> 38:28.043
He's not in the DC system,
or Virginia or Maryland.

38:28.078 --> 38:29.643
Do you want me to run all 50 states?

38:33.843 --> 38:35.243
It's getting really late.

38:35.943 --> 38:36.943
Not that I'm...

38:37.143 --> 38:39.743
tired or anything from a lack
of caffeine, 'cause I'm not.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.143
At all. Really.

38:42.443 --> 38:45.643
My meter is running full blast, Gibbs.

38:53.343 --> 38:54.343
Relax, Abs.

38:54.843 --> 38:56.243
I think you just solved the case.

38:57.643 --> 38:58.643
I did?

38:59.243 --> 39:00.243
Meters.

39:00.443 --> 39:02.443
A form of measurement
used extensively in Europe.

39:02.943 --> 39:04.043
Taxi meters, DiNozzo.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.708
Bayliss keep meter
records for gypsy drivers?

39:06.743 --> 39:09.643
Sure. Without records, he wouldn't
be able to keep track of kickbacks.

39:09.743 --> 39:10.843
Bayliss's laptop.

39:11.043 --> 39:14.043
Every driver who hasn't reported
to work for the past 72 hours.

39:14.243 --> 39:16.343
I'm only interested in
meters that are not running.

39:16.543 --> 39:19.543
I don't follow. But I'm
willing to give it a try.

39:20.343 --> 39:21.343
I get it.

39:21.443 --> 39:24.543
Zuri heard about other cabdrivers being
attacked. He knows they're after him.

39:24.643 --> 39:26.943
So he would have stopped
driving after the first attack.

39:27.043 --> 39:28.008
Put it up.

39:28.043 --> 39:30.343
Dumping all females,
non-African-Americans,

39:30.443 --> 39:32.443
everyone over 50 and under 30.

39:33.043 --> 39:34.943
Match the rest against
our victims' stats.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.643
Five left, boss.

39:39.943 --> 39:40.943
Sayda?

39:44.943 --> 39:45.943
That is Thomas.

39:46.143 --> 39:47.343
That is my husband.

39:47.443 --> 39:49.343
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

39:49.643 --> 39:51.943
- Give me the address, McGee.
- I want to come with you.

39:52.243 --> 39:54.143
I want to see him. Please.

39:56.043 --> 39:57.143
Please.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.343
Yamaha's on the side.
Engine's still hot.

40:13.643 --> 40:15.843
McGee, you're out front.
DiNozzo, you're with us.

40:18.243 --> 40:19.443
I will not have a...

40:19.543 --> 40:20.943
to ruin my country...

40:21.143 --> 40:22.943
It's time for you to die.

40:23.143 --> 40:26.043
If you're going to do this,
do it, but do not harm my wife.

40:26.643 --> 40:28.843
Shut up, shopkeeper. Be still.

40:29.043 --> 40:31.343
Be still, or she will
end up dead like you.

40:31.743 --> 40:34.843
If you think I would let you return
to my country, you are wrong...

40:35.143 --> 40:36.543
NCIS! Drop your weapons!

40:54.243 --> 40:55.043
You.

40:55.143 --> 40:56.743
Hello again, Professor Abaka.

41:00.843 --> 41:01.843
Thomas Zuri?

41:02.043 --> 41:02.943
Yes.

41:03.043 --> 41:04.443
You're a hard man to find.

41:05.643 --> 41:06.643
Perhaps...

41:07.043 --> 41:08.043
not hard enough.

41:10.543 --> 41:11.643
My wife...

41:26.843 --> 41:28.743
- He is okay.
- Thank you.

41:31.843 --> 41:33.443
Seven years is a long time.

41:35.143 --> 41:36.243
Thomas.

41:38.143 --> 41:39.143
Sayda.

41:40.643 --> 41:42.543
I have missed you so much.

41:43.143 --> 41:46.243
You have been in my heart every moment.

41:47.343 --> 41:48.343
Sayda.

41:52.643 --> 41:53.643
I wrote to you.

41:54.343 --> 41:56.643
So many letters. Hundreds.

41:57.543 --> 41:59.843
But I just received one letter, Thomas.

42:00.243 --> 42:02.943
And then I heard that the army had...

42:03.343 --> 42:05.843
- killed everyone in our village.
- I survived.

42:06.043 --> 42:07.443
We both survived.

42:17.543 --> 42:18.643
I thought...

42:19.543 --> 42:21.443
I would never see you again.

42:27.343 --> 42:29.943
I'm so sorry, Sayda.

42:31.443 --> 42:32.743
I am so very sorry.

42:41.843 --> 42:43.143
It's okay, Thomas.

42:47.743 --> 42:48.943
I understand.

42:54.143 --> 42:56.743
I am just glad you are safe.

43:01.243 --> 43:02.243
Sayda.

43:10.543 --> 43:11.543
Sayda.

43:22.843 --> 43:23.843
Let's go in.
