00:02.147 --> 00:04.257
Oh, look at all
that chest hair.

00:04.358 --> 00:05.390
And overbite.

00:05.392 --> 00:07.225
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

00:09.029 --> 00:11.563
Son of a bitch, he bit me.

00:11.565 --> 00:15.000
Okay, I guess I'll just go to
the emergency room to be safe.

00:15.002 --> 00:17.769
Howie, this is just
your hypochondria.

00:17.771 --> 00:20.105
When I sat on the mute button
and thought I'd gone deaf,

00:20.107 --> 00:21.940
that was my hypochondria.

00:30.718 --> 00:34.219
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

00:38.158 --> 00:39.491
Morning.

00:39.493 --> 00:40.792
Morning.

00:40.794 --> 00:42.461
"We"?

00:42.463 --> 00:43.862
What is this?

00:43.864 --> 00:45.063
I don't know.

00:45.065 --> 00:46.665
Maybe it says
something on the back.

00:48.235 --> 00:51.203
"Continued on milk."

00:51.205 --> 00:53.271
If you're tricking me
into making my own breakfast,

00:53.273 --> 00:55.440
it didn't work for my mom,
and it won't work for you.

00:57.244 --> 00:58.243
"Are."

00:58.245 --> 01:00.912
"We are..."

01:00.914 --> 01:02.581
"See spoons for more."

01:03.917 --> 01:05.316
What could it be?

01:05.319 --> 01:06.651
"We are Groot"?

01:06.653 --> 01:08.320
"We are the champions"?

01:08.322 --> 01:09.988
"We are family"?

01:09.990 --> 01:11.823
"I got all my sisters with me."

01:16.163 --> 01:17.462
Are you serious?

01:17.464 --> 01:19.631
Yeah.

01:19.633 --> 01:22.934
Are you sure?

01:24.405 --> 01:26.705
Pretty positive.

01:26.707 --> 01:28.507
That's a joke, because
the pregnancy test says...

01:28.509 --> 01:30.041
Oh, my God.

01:32.846 --> 01:34.379
This is incredible.

01:34.381 --> 01:36.982
We're gonna be parents?

01:36.984 --> 01:40.452
We're gonna get
to board planes first.

01:41.588 --> 01:43.221
Finally gonna get to see

01:43.223 --> 01:46.725
what's in that family bathroom
at the mall.

01:46.727 --> 01:48.860
I know, it's crazy.

01:48.862 --> 01:50.962
It is crazy.

01:50.964 --> 01:52.264
Oh.

01:52.266 --> 01:56.001
I mean, how do you... prepare
for something like this?

01:56.003 --> 01:59.204
I'm not even sure
I've held a baby before.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.906
Oh, it's okay,
you'll figure it out.

02:00.908 --> 02:02.841
But how's this all gonna work?

02:02.843 --> 02:03.975
Do we get a nanny?

02:03.977 --> 02:05.210
I mean, can we
afford a nanny?

02:05.212 --> 02:07.012
And if we can,
we can't get a pretty one,

02:07.014 --> 02:08.979
'cause it'll wreck our marriage.

02:10.383 --> 02:13.485
We can't get an ugly one,
'cause it'll scare the kid.

02:15.355 --> 02:17.155
I-I don't know, Howie.

02:17.157 --> 02:18.623
Are we in a good
school district?

02:18.625 --> 02:19.858
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.893
What religion do
we raise it?

02:21.895 --> 02:23.395
And if it's a boy,
do we get him circumcised?

02:23.397 --> 02:24.596
People say it's barbaric,

02:24.598 --> 02:27.499
but if we don't, it looks like
a pig in a blanket.

02:30.637 --> 02:33.071
Calm down, it's
gonna be okay.

02:33.073 --> 02:34.639
How's it gonna be okay?

02:34.641 --> 02:38.076
Look at me, I'm a mess.

02:38.078 --> 02:39.744
And that means this baby's
gonna half a mess.

02:39.746 --> 02:41.012
And that's even
before we screw it up

02:41.014 --> 02:43.815
with our cut-rate
moderately attractive nanny.

03:14.251 --> 03:17.252
Hey, Raj, I read a couple
guys in your department

03:17.254 --> 03:19.354
may have discovered a new
planet in our solar system?

03:19.356 --> 03:21.089
Oh, I heard about that.

03:21.091 --> 03:22.624
Why didn't you
discover it?

03:22.626 --> 03:25.260
Because instead of being
in the telescope room,

03:25.262 --> 03:29.865
I was busy making you guys
homemade jam for the holidays.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.199
Well, you be sure
to let us know

03:31.201 --> 03:34.736
when you win the Nobel
Prize for boysenberry.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.207
Hey.

03:39.209 --> 03:40.275
Hello.
Hey, bud.

03:40.277 --> 03:41.777
Ready to play when you are.

03:41.779 --> 03:42.911
Yeah, um, in a minute.

03:42.913 --> 03:45.147
I actually need
to tell you guys something.

03:45.149 --> 03:46.648
If it's "thank you"
for the homemade jam

03:46.650 --> 03:48.483
you got in December,
congratulations,

03:48.485 --> 03:50.852
you're the
first one.

03:50.854 --> 03:53.188
What's going on?

03:54.792 --> 03:57.159
I'm, uh...

03:57.161 --> 03:59.127
uh, gonna be a father.

03:59.129 --> 04:01.163
That's so amazing.
What? Congratulations.

04:01.165 --> 04:03.498
Oh, no.

04:04.435 --> 04:06.134
Why "oh, no"?

04:06.136 --> 04:08.103
Because this changes everything.

04:08.105 --> 04:09.471
What about comic book night?

04:09.473 --> 04:11.473
Uh, what about playing
games together?

04:11.475 --> 04:13.141
What about our trips
to Disneyland?

04:13.143 --> 04:16.278
How can we do those things
with a child around?

04:17.447 --> 04:20.281
Relax, there's room
for two babies in this group.

04:20.284 --> 04:21.649
Oh, dear L...

04:21.652 --> 04:23.552
Penny's pregnant, too?

04:23.554 --> 04:25.721
You're the other baby.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.155
Oh, really?

04:27.157 --> 04:30.425
Okay, well, would a baby have
to shave once every 11 days?

04:32.463 --> 04:35.030
Would an adult refuse
to eat his graham crackers

04:35.032 --> 04:37.132
because one of them was broken?

04:37.134 --> 04:39.000
I guess we'll call this a draw.

04:41.772 --> 04:43.538
So, I'm glad
you guys are here.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.140
There's something I want
to share with you.

04:45.142 --> 04:47.576
Howie and I are going to...

04:47.578 --> 04:49.211
Leonard says you're pregnant.

04:49.213 --> 04:50.479
What?

04:50.481 --> 04:51.380
"Don't say anything.

04:51.382 --> 04:53.281
Act surprised
when she tells you."

04:53.283 --> 04:55.183
All right,
how you want to do this?

04:56.620 --> 04:58.186
I'm pregnant.

04:58.188 --> 04:59.588
Oh, my God, I
can't believe it!

04:59.590 --> 05:00.856
This is so exciting!

05:00.858 --> 05:03.525
Yeah, it's all real exciting.

05:03.527 --> 05:06.595
Are-are you not
happy about this?

05:06.597 --> 05:09.831
I am. Of-of course I am. I'm...

05:09.833 --> 05:11.366
I'm sure it's just the hormones.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.503
But it's weird-- Howie's the one
who's been talking about

05:14.505 --> 05:15.937
having kids for years, and I was

05:15.939 --> 05:18.373
all excited to tell him because
I thought he'd be thrilled,

05:18.375 --> 05:20.142
but then he started to flip out

05:20.144 --> 05:22.010
and now this
feels like a bad idea

05:22.012 --> 05:25.013
and I'm gonna get fat.

05:25.015 --> 05:26.748
No, no, come on. Come on,
you're not gonna get fat.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.417
You're gonna be beautiful
and glowing

05:28.419 --> 05:30.819
and-and have the cutest
little baby bump ever.

05:30.821 --> 05:33.088
Easy for you to say,
skinny bitch.

05:34.925 --> 05:36.892
Sorry, hormones.

05:36.894 --> 05:38.960
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."

05:39.863 --> 05:42.264
I wouldn't make too much
out of Howard

05:42.266 --> 05:43.995
not reacting the way
you expected him to.

05:44.019 --> 05:45.034
Yeah, I'm sure

05:45.035 --> 05:46.635
it was just
the initial shock of it all.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.804
You're probably right.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.473
After we talked about it,
he started to calm down.

05:51.475 --> 05:53.208
I shouldn't be raising a kid.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.410
I don't even
eat my own vegetables.

05:56.613 --> 05:58.847
Buddy, I-I think
you might be overreacting.

05:58.849 --> 06:00.749
And then there's
this nose.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.819
I mean, what if he
looks like me?

06:05.088 --> 06:06.288
Or worse...

06:06.290 --> 06:08.790
what if <i>she</i> looks like me?

06:08.792 --> 06:10.292
Not to mention

06:10.294 --> 06:12.294
the impact on our social circle.

06:12.296 --> 06:13.562
Everything's going to change.

06:13.564 --> 06:15.397
Howard won't be able
to come over as much.

06:15.399 --> 06:17.599
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to

06:17.601 --> 06:20.368
baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister

06:20.370 --> 06:22.337
has one of those toilet locks
in her bathroom.

06:22.339 --> 06:25.207
I have two doctorates,
I still had to go in the sink.

06:27.144 --> 06:29.110
Oh, my God,
and do you have any idea

06:29.112 --> 06:32.247
how expensive having a kid is?

06:32.249 --> 06:34.683
I read that in Los Angeles,
raising a child through college

06:34.685 --> 06:36.651
can cost over a million dollars.

06:36.653 --> 06:38.720
A million dollars?

06:38.722 --> 06:42.424
God, it's like my nuts
just kicked me in the nuts.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.860
That's it-- I got to start

06:44.862 --> 06:46.962
earning more money right now.

06:46.964 --> 06:48.630
I know--
you could ask Bernadette

06:48.632 --> 06:51.032
for a raise in your allowance.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.801
This isn't a joke.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.636
I wasn't joking.

06:56.740 --> 06:57.939
It'll be fine.

06:57.941 --> 06:59.407
People have kids every day.

06:59.409 --> 07:00.775
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on,

07:00.777 --> 07:02.811
this is great news
and you know it.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.713
Oh... You're right, it is,

07:04.715 --> 07:08.350
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.

07:08.352 --> 07:10.619
Hey, you know what we should do?

07:10.621 --> 07:13.488
All get vasectomies so this
doesn't happen to us?

07:15.993 --> 07:18.360
Go out and celebrate.

07:19.296 --> 07:21.463
But not your worst idea.

07:23.634 --> 07:26.768
Hey, let's go do something
to get your mind off this.

07:26.770 --> 07:29.037
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?

07:29.039 --> 07:30.338
Uh, I don't know, a bar?

07:30.340 --> 07:31.873
Can't drink.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.576
We can, but all right.

07:34.578 --> 07:36.912
Are you hungry? How about
that sushi place you love?

07:36.914 --> 07:39.915
Doctor said I can't have sushi.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.416
Okay, look, we don't
have to go anywhere.

07:41.418 --> 07:44.019
We can just, you know, stay here
and hang out in the hot tub.

07:44.021 --> 07:46.354
Doctor said I can't
go in the hot tub.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.658
Maybe you should
get a new doctor.

07:51.695 --> 07:55.263
What, he said
you can't laugh either?

07:56.466 --> 07:59.734
I'd like to propose a toast
to our friend, Howard--

07:59.736 --> 08:02.604
his, um, his big heart,
his beautiful soul...

08:02.606 --> 08:03.772
And his tight little pants

08:03.774 --> 08:06.074
that somehow
did not make him sterile.

08:06.076 --> 08:08.310
Cheers.

08:10.247 --> 08:12.113
Well, look at this.

08:12.115 --> 08:13.982
I bet whoever invented
tiny umbrellas

08:13.984 --> 08:15.817
doesn't have to worry
about money.

08:15.819 --> 08:18.219
He can have
all the kids he wants.

08:18.221 --> 08:21.556
And can keep a small portion
of their heads dry.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.261
If I'm gonna have any chance
of raising this kid,

08:26.263 --> 08:29.431
I need to come up with
a big idea to make some money.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.266
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.

08:31.268 --> 08:32.900
You and Sheldon
already came up with

08:32.903 --> 08:34.568
your superfluid helium model.

08:34.571 --> 08:35.971
That's just research.
We're never gonna

08:35.972 --> 08:37.472
make any money from it.

08:37.474 --> 08:39.174
Forget helium.
The real superfluid

08:39.176 --> 08:41.943
is the fruit punch in this mug.

08:41.945 --> 08:44.346
Reminds me of my daddy's secret

08:44.348 --> 08:46.581
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.

08:48.652 --> 08:50.885
Uh, these are strong,
you should slow down.

08:50.887 --> 08:53.321
Oh. I'll just take one last sip.

08:59.432 --> 09:00.432
Ah.

09:10.738 --> 09:13.739
Okay, how about this
for an invention--

09:13.741 --> 09:17.009
slightly... bigger
cocktail umbrellas.

09:18.312 --> 09:19.878
How is that a new invention?

09:19.880 --> 09:22.281
I don't know, all Apple does
is change the size of things

09:22.283 --> 09:24.483
and we keep buying them.

09:24.485 --> 09:28.287
It's true. I like my giant iPad
and my little iPad

09:28.289 --> 09:31.757
almost as much
as my regular-sized iPad.

09:31.759 --> 09:33.992
This place is terrific.

09:33.994 --> 09:36.595
Why-why have
we never been here before?

09:36.597 --> 09:40.933
The same reason we don't do
a lot of fun stuff-- you.

09:40.935 --> 09:43.035
That's some smart talk
from a guy

09:43.037 --> 09:45.504
who can't even keep
his face in focus.

09:48.108 --> 09:50.342
Where's the bathroom?

09:50.344 --> 09:51.510
Uh, it's in the corner.

09:51.512 --> 09:53.712
Excuse me.

09:55.149 --> 09:57.950
Hey, how you doin'?

09:59.987 --> 10:01.887
I hope the bathroom
is clearly marked.

10:01.889 --> 10:03.021
Doesn't matter.

10:03.023 --> 10:05.324
He's headed
for the kitchen anyway.

10:06.226 --> 10:07.359
Maybe that's an idea--

10:07.361 --> 10:09.928
guidance systems
for drunk people.

10:09.930 --> 10:12.230
They have that.
It's called Uber.

10:12.232 --> 10:13.599
Hey.

10:13.601 --> 10:15.334
In your supercooled
helium experiments,

10:15.336 --> 10:17.803
did you create
quantum vortices?

10:17.805 --> 10:18.804
Yeah. Why?

10:18.806 --> 10:20.105
Well, if you made
a guidance system,

10:20.107 --> 10:22.541
couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

10:22.543 --> 10:25.010
Wow. I've never thought
about that.

10:25.012 --> 10:26.612
And since
it's in a quantum state,

10:26.614 --> 10:28.413
it would maintain
an infinite persistence.

10:28.415 --> 10:31.049
Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks.

10:31.051 --> 10:35.087
Tell me this isn't like the best
episode of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

10:37.124 --> 10:39.858
You may have actually
just come up with something.

10:39.860 --> 10:41.560
You think so?
I really do.

10:41.562 --> 10:44.563
You guys, the bathroom
here is amazing.

10:44.565 --> 10:47.199
There's people
cooking in it.

10:49.937 --> 10:51.436
Think about all the fun
things you get to do

10:51.438 --> 10:52.804
when you have a baby.
Yeah!

10:52.806 --> 10:56.041
Yeah, you get to buy toys
and little clothes.

10:56.043 --> 10:59.044
I kind of already do that
for Howie.

10:59.046 --> 11:00.946
And-and whenever you're hungry,

11:00.948 --> 11:05.050
you'll be in a minivan with
Cheerios all over the floor.

11:05.052 --> 11:07.919
Oh, and I just found a
new travel cup for Sheldon.

11:07.921 --> 11:10.055
It only lets out
three at a time.

11:11.158 --> 11:13.859
So, when did you guys
decide to get pregnant?

11:13.861 --> 11:16.628
Well, we didn't exactly decide.

11:16.630 --> 11:17.896
We were talking about it,

11:17.898 --> 11:20.132
and then one night
we got a little reckless.

11:20.134 --> 11:22.134
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.

11:22.136 --> 11:23.368
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on,

11:23.370 --> 11:25.137
we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.

11:25.139 --> 11:28.173
Me! Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!

11:30.577 --> 11:32.577
Fine.

11:32.579 --> 11:34.112
We were out one night,

11:34.114 --> 11:37.683
and things got
a little spontaneous.

11:37.685 --> 11:39.618
Oh, that sounds juicy.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.553
Well, Sheldon was going on
and on about time zones

11:41.555 --> 11:44.409
and railroad schedules,
and I went out...

11:44.410 --> 11:46.793
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.

11:46.794 --> 11:50.429
You did it
at our place?

11:50.431 --> 11:53.632
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.

11:53.634 --> 11:56.234
What?!
No!

11:57.071 --> 11:59.037
I was headed to the bathroom,

11:59.039 --> 12:01.373
and I passed Howie
on his way out.

12:01.375 --> 12:05.243
Usually he says,
"Do not go in there,"

12:05.245 --> 12:10.182
but this time he said,
"Hey, let's go in here."

12:10.184 --> 12:11.717
How could you do that?
I'm sorry,

12:11.719 --> 12:13.952
but you know what it's like
when you're with your man

12:13.954 --> 12:15.620
and one thing leads to another.

12:15.622 --> 12:18.190
I do know what that's like.
I really do.

12:20.828 --> 12:22.394
I'm not seeing anyone

12:22.396 --> 12:24.496
using liquid helium
vortices like this.

12:24.498 --> 12:26.364
I'm not finding
anything either.

12:26.366 --> 12:27.599
That's a good sign.

12:27.601 --> 12:29.534
Oh, wait, I found something.

12:29.536 --> 12:30.902
Damn. What is it?

12:30.904 --> 12:33.772
This video.
The baby panda sneezes,

12:33.774 --> 12:36.742
and the mama panda
gets so scared.

12:40.180 --> 12:41.980
Can you focus
on what we're talking about?

12:41.982 --> 12:43.415
All right.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.951
Look, now,
this may be the rum talking,

12:45.953 --> 12:48.887
but as long as the unpinning
rate of the vortices

12:48.889 --> 12:51.356
is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,

12:51.358 --> 12:54.726
the Magnus force issue
should be negligible.

12:56.196 --> 12:59.965
Even drunk, he's still smarter
than all of us.

12:59.967 --> 13:01.900
And stronger.

13:01.902 --> 13:05.370
Yeah. Who wants to see me
beat up the bartender?

13:06.206 --> 13:08.006
I'd enjoy that.

13:08.008 --> 13:10.475
Nah, she's a good kid.

13:12.346 --> 13:15.013
If this is a viable thing,
we could get a patent

13:15.015 --> 13:18.083
and license it to companies
that make guidance systems.

13:18.085 --> 13:20.552
Look at that. You've known
you're gonna be a father

13:20.554 --> 13:23.221
for less than a day
and you're already stepping up.

13:23.223 --> 13:24.456
I'm telling you,
you got this.

13:24.458 --> 13:25.724
Maybe you're right.

13:25.726 --> 13:27.192
Of course he's right.

13:27.194 --> 13:30.962
You and I both know how hard it
is growing up without a father.

13:30.964 --> 13:32.864
That's why I'm confident
you're gonna be

13:32.866 --> 13:34.599
the best dad you can be.

13:35.435 --> 13:37.502
Thank you, Sheldon.

13:37.504 --> 13:38.804
You're welcome.

13:38.806 --> 13:40.405
And if he has
twins, we can do

13:40.407 --> 13:43.875
all kinds
of neat experiments on them.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.214
You guys can go in
if you want.

13:49.216 --> 13:50.515
No, we're a team.

13:50.517 --> 13:52.484
If you can't go in,
we're not going in.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.620
Then why are we drinking?

13:55.622 --> 13:58.356
Okay, it's not like she's got
the Christ child in there,

13:58.358 --> 14:00.292
all right?

14:01.728 --> 14:03.261
Oh. It's Leonard.

14:03.263 --> 14:05.564
He says Sheldon's drunk
and they're gonna do karaoke

14:05.566 --> 14:06.698
if we want to join them.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.633
That sounds fun.

14:08.635 --> 14:10.535
Oh, no.

14:10.537 --> 14:12.470
Sheldon's drunk
texting me.

14:12.472 --> 14:13.505
What's it say?

14:13.507 --> 14:16.241
"Would you like
to sing karaoke with us."

14:16.243 --> 14:17.676
How is that a drunk text?

14:17.678 --> 14:19.578
He used a period
instead of a question mark.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.047
