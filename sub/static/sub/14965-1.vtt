00:26.890 --> 00:29.560
Jeun Jee-hyun Cha Tae-hyun.

00:35.024 --> 00:39.862
MY SASSY GIRL

00:57.421 --> 00:59.131
Exactly two years ago today,

00:59.215 --> 01:04.053
she and I buried
a time capsule here.

01:05.012 --> 01:09.684
We promised to meet here
two years Later,

01:10.727 --> 01:14.397
but she hasn't come yet.

01:15.356 --> 01:17.817
I'm going to wait.

01:25.575 --> 01:26.743
Here we go.

01:27.577 --> 01:28.536
Please don't move.

01:29.079 --> 01:30.413
One, two...

01:30.497 --> 01:31.706
Wait a minute.

01:36.086 --> 01:38.880
Hello? Oh, auntie.

01:39.506 --> 01:42.425
Sorry, I'm on my way.

01:43.093 --> 01:47.389
I'm really sorry. Yes, I'm coming.

01:48.265 --> 01:52.394
I'm having my photo taken. Bye.

01:54.104 --> 01:55.564
Are you ready?

01:57.316 --> 01:58.775
Here we go.

01:59.776 --> 02:01.737
One, two...

02:03.822 --> 02:05.866
My parents wanted a daughter,

02:05.949 --> 02:08.786
so they raised me like one.

02:10.829 --> 02:14.416
So I thought I was a girl
until I was seven.

02:18.962 --> 02:21.882
I had to go to the women's
public bath, too.

02:22.633 --> 02:24.134
The older I got,

02:24.301 --> 02:27.888
I thought my penis would
get smaller and disappear.

02:28.722 --> 02:32.685
But it was the opposite.

02:38.733 --> 02:42.069
First Half.

02:43.321 --> 02:44.488
He hasn't changed at all.

02:44.572 --> 02:46.991
No, I'm a real man now.

02:47.533 --> 02:48.117
Hey, asshole.

02:48.409 --> 02:51.579
Think clerical work in the
army makes you a man?

02:51.704 --> 02:53.372
You irritate me!

02:53.539 --> 02:55.458
Give me a break, asshole.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.126
My job was tougher than you could imagine.

02:57.168 --> 02:59.670
Hey!! I worked near the DMZ.

02:59.712 --> 03:02.048
Who are you kidding?

03:02.215 --> 03:05.009
Hold it. Anyway, welcome back home.

03:05.802 --> 03:06.928
She's just my type.

03:07.011 --> 03:09.639
When I see my type,
I can't help it.

03:09.847 --> 03:11.516
I need to hit on her.

03:17.522 --> 03:19.274
Who's interrupting me?

03:19.357 --> 03:20.942
Hello? Who is this?

03:21.025 --> 03:23.319
Your mother, you bastard.
Oh, mom...

03:23.403 --> 03:25.155
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?

03:25.238 --> 03:27.949
I'm leaving soon.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.120
Keep quiet! It's my mom!

03:32.204 --> 03:33.330
Talk over there!

03:33.413 --> 03:34.664
Make sure you pay a visit.

03:34.706 --> 03:36.625
It's been over a year since you saw her.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.919
That long?

03:39.127 --> 03:43.048
You know she feels lonely after
losing her son last year.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.425
She says you resemble him.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.929
She'll be so glad to see you.

03:49.346 --> 03:50.889
Still there?

03:52.557 --> 03:54.685
We don't look alike.

03:54.768 --> 03:59.231
Plus, I hate when she rubs
my face and kisses me.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.691
Uncle does, too.

04:01.316 --> 04:04.486
She'll introduce you to a girl. Hey!

04:04.695 --> 04:07.364
I know the type she likes.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.782
Tell her no thanks.

04:18.167 --> 04:23.589
I want to meet a girl like the ones
in romantic comic books.

04:24.757 --> 04:26.258
But on that day...

05:17.519 --> 05:20.981
She's my type, but I don't like her.

05:21.231 --> 05:22.315
Why?

05:23.149 --> 05:26.278
Drunk girls disgust me.

05:56.934 --> 05:59.436
Hey, get up!

05:59.728 --> 06:02.272
Offer your seat to the elder!

06:07.987 --> 06:08.779
Ugh!

06:15.369 --> 06:16.162
Go!

06:28.215 --> 06:29.091
Hey.

06:31.844 --> 06:33.930
Don't wear pink.

08:20.204 --> 08:21.289
Honey!

08:24.834 --> 08:25.835
She call him honey!

08:25.918 --> 08:27.170
I'm not...

08:27.837 --> 08:28.629
What are you doing!

08:29.505 --> 08:30.590
I'm not...

08:31.215 --> 08:32.633
You handle this!

08:33.676 --> 08:35.511
I'm not...

08:35.595 --> 08:37.347
Think I'm stupid?

08:38.348 --> 08:39.432
Come here!

08:45.396 --> 08:46.648
Are you laughing?

08:47.482 --> 08:50.110
Why didn't you look after her?

08:51.236 --> 08:53.488
Hurry and do something!

09:16.386 --> 09:17.971
What are you doing?

09:25.771 --> 09:29.858
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.

09:30.817 --> 09:34.029
Forget it. Just take care of her.

11:18.093 --> 11:20.178
Nothing's there when you need it.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.850
Where did all those motels go?

11:26.018 --> 11:28.645
I hate being with a drunk girl.

11:29.813 --> 11:32.775
Carrying her on my back is worse.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.282
Wow, your honeys wasted.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.077
No, it's not my fault.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.454
Of course, it is. I know everything.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.750
You see, we're engaged.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.795
Western or Korean style?

11:52.878 --> 11:54.797
Give me any room.

11:57.008 --> 11:57.967
Room 405.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.510
None on the first floor?

11:59.552 --> 12:00.469
Fourth floor!

12:29.833 --> 12:31.000
You forgot to check in.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.716
It's 40,000 won, kid.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.552
What? 40,000 won?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.930
Why? Find another place then.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.560
Count it.

13:38.920 --> 13:39.796
Hello?

13:41.329 --> 13:42.956
This phone's owner?

13:45.834 --> 13:48.211
She's sleeping beside me.

13:49.171 --> 13:50.964
What? Here?

13:52.132 --> 13:55.093
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.

13:59.097 --> 14:00.766
Better wash and leave fast.

14:04.019 --> 14:05.604
Aha~!

14:34.717 --> 14:35.718
Hands in the air!

14:39.805 --> 14:40.765
What are you doing?

14:42.642 --> 14:43.559
Hands in the air!

14:47.230 --> 14:49.273
Aaggh~~~~~~!

14:55.240 --> 14:56.033
All of you.

14:56.158 --> 14:58.535
Eat one a piece, okay?

14:59.161 --> 15:00.412
Yes, boss.

15:00.496 --> 15:03.916
What are you looking at?
Look away.

15:06.335 --> 15:08.128
Gyeon-woo! You're out!

15:23.574 --> 15:24.784
Did you go to Bupyung?

15:25.743 --> 15:27.537
Yes, I did.

15:28.803 --> 15:29.595
Come here!

15:29.679 --> 15:31.472
Where did you sleep?

15:33.141 --> 15:34.726
Your aunt said you didn't come!

15:34.767 --> 15:36.269
And you're telling me a lie!

15:36.352 --> 15:39.439
What happen to your sweater?

15:40.690 --> 15:43.067
I'm such a poor guy.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.529
All this cause of a drunk girl.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.491
I wanna die.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.830
You asked if I went to Bupyung!

15:56.164 --> 15:58.959
I did, but not to see auntie!

15:59.292 --> 16:01.795
What?

16:08.969 --> 16:11.763
Bastard! Wait till he comes back.

16:12.881 --> 16:15.717
Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.179
An engineering major. Study?

16:20.096 --> 16:21.973
I'm smart, but I never study.

16:22.224 --> 16:24.518
My parents can prove that.

16:26.061 --> 16:30.399
You're smart like me,
but studying is your problem.

16:30.982 --> 16:33.693
Since you inherited
your brain from me,

16:33.694 --> 16:38.323
you'll get good grades
if you study harder, idiot.

16:44.288 --> 16:46.540
Up four points in three years.

16:46.623 --> 16:49.001
Call this a report card?

16:49.793 --> 16:52.796
Since you inherited
your brain from your mom,

16:53.047 --> 16:55.841
you'll get good grades
if you study harder.

16:55.924 --> 16:59.386
If you raise kids,
never tell them they're smart.

16:59.762 --> 17:01.263
They'll never study.

17:02.890 --> 17:04.183
My goals?

17:04.934 --> 17:06.685
Haven't thought about it yet.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.270
You know now?

17:09.021 --> 17:09.939
You got it.

17:10.481 --> 17:12.066
I'm a hopeless student.

17:16.487 --> 17:17.405
Hello?

17:17.488 --> 17:19.532
Who are you, asshole?

17:21.075 --> 17:23.494
What? Who's calling?

17:23.578 --> 17:25.872
Why were you naked
in a motel with me?

17:25.913 --> 17:26.497
What?

17:26.581 --> 17:27.373
Come out!

17:27.456 --> 17:29.083
To Bupyung station now!

17:29.167 --> 17:30.460
Uh...

17:30.543 --> 17:31.711
How could she do this?

17:31.794 --> 17:35.381
I went to jail and got beaten
with a vacuum for her.

17:59.656 --> 18:01.074
Excuse me.

18:01.783 --> 18:02.492
Is it you?

18:03.159 --> 18:03.910
Yes?

18:05.453 --> 18:06.580
Follow me.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.042
Get over here.

18:21.595 --> 18:22.679
What do you wanna eat?

18:23.972 --> 18:25.057
Cherry jubilee...

18:25.140 --> 18:27.434
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...

18:27.684 --> 18:30.479
Jamonka Almonds good, too.

18:31.188 --> 18:33.398
I'll just have a Love Me.

18:33.482 --> 18:36.235
Hey, wanna die?

18:38.695 --> 18:39.738
Drink coffee.

18:41.407 --> 18:42.616
Two coffees.

18:43.450 --> 18:44.785
You pay for it.

18:49.965 --> 18:50.800
Girl: Tell me.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.343
What happened last night?

18:53.552 --> 18:55.137
Well, it's...

18:55.221 --> 18:58.849
You were drunk, so...

18:59.517 --> 19:02.395
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!

19:03.688 --> 19:05.314
You see.

19:05.398 --> 19:07.900
You were drunk and staggering
at the subway station.

19:07.984 --> 19:11.404
I saved you from the train.

19:12.488 --> 19:16.576
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.

19:17.327 --> 19:19.746
Pretending to be drunk
and vomiting

19:19.829 --> 19:22.832
to use the guy
in a state of confusion.

19:22.916 --> 19:25.043
So I called you honey?

19:25.126 --> 19:26.502
That's right.

19:27.086 --> 19:29.464
I kind of remember that.

19:30.799 --> 19:33.718
You showered to wash
off vomit and sweat,

19:34.511 --> 19:35.428
and the police came?

19:35.678 --> 19:36.679
Gyeon-woo: That's right.

19:38.348 --> 19:39.265
Would you believe that, too?

19:40.350 --> 19:45.438
To a girl like this, you need to
show her who's the boss.

19:45.522 --> 19:47.023
So I did that, right?

19:48.233 --> 19:48.900
Yes, you did.

19:56.241 --> 19:57.569
Sorry, it's late.

19:57.610 --> 19:58.840
Yeah...

20:07.252 --> 20:12.382
When she's not drunk,
she's just my type.

20:13.133 --> 20:19.348
You look prettier and livelier
than yesterday.

20:23.185 --> 20:24.853
Are you mocking me?

20:26.397 --> 20:28.983
No, I'm not.

20:31.068 --> 20:32.903
Then are you hitting on me?

20:35.698 --> 20:37.158
I don't wanna date you.

20:37.992 --> 20:41.579
We're not destined
for each other.

20:42.955 --> 20:44.040
Throw the trash away.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.251
Damn it.

20:54.592 --> 20:56.385
I think she's a heavy drinker.

21:04.060 --> 21:05.061
You order.

21:08.356 --> 21:11.317
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.

21:11.985 --> 21:13.695
Eat Golbangee.

21:14.779 --> 21:16.656
Then you should order.

21:16.739 --> 21:18.199
Stop pouting!

21:18.950 --> 21:19.909
Golbangee, please.

21:23.621 --> 21:25.331
Let's go somewhere fun later.

21:25.457 --> 21:27.042
Teenage girl 1:I know what that means.

21:27.125 --> 21:30.962
A motel? Are you rich?
Of course.

21:31.046 --> 21:32.255
How much will you give us?

21:32.339 --> 21:34.215
We'll see, so don't worry.

21:36.718 --> 21:38.929
You kids are prostituting, huh?

21:39.971 --> 21:42.474
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!

21:42.516 --> 21:45.352
Teenage girl 1:What's it to you?
Mind your own business.

21:45.435 --> 21:49.356
We're just having a drink with
some friends. What's wrong?

21:49.439 --> 21:52.317
You take friends to a motel?

21:52.943 --> 21:54.236
How old are you kids?

21:54.319 --> 21:57.239
Teenage girl 1:Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.

21:57.322 --> 21:59.950
Think I'm doing this
'cause you're drinking?

22:00.284 --> 22:02.286
Show me your lD. You, too.

22:02.369 --> 22:03.745
Teenage girl 1:What's with you?

22:03.829 --> 22:05.622
Show it, now.

22:06.540 --> 22:08.208
Teenage girl 1:This sucks.

22:09.960 --> 22:13.922
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,

22:14.006 --> 22:16.842
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.

22:16.925 --> 22:19.345
Who are you to butt
in other people's business?

22:19.428 --> 22:23.682
Don't you have a daughter?
I don't. Bear me one.

22:23.766 --> 22:26.727
Who the hell do you think
you are?

22:26.810 --> 22:28.395
How dare you?
Come on, let's fight!

22:28.479 --> 22:30.356
Come on! I'll show you.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.109
Don't live like that!

22:33.859 --> 22:35.444
Catch the girls.

22:45.079 --> 22:47.456
Have a drink and calm down.

23:03.932 --> 23:05.683
Shit!

23:13.316 --> 23:14.526
Ah~!

23:18.905 --> 23:20.505
Huk~!

23:25.870 --> 23:29.791
Seeing a girl cry
makes me sad for some reason.

23:31.251 --> 23:36.506
She's more attractive
the closer I look at her.

23:38.483 --> 23:40.861
Did you blow your nose on this?

23:42.154 --> 23:42.988
No.

23:47.909 --> 23:54.499
Huk~ huk~ huk~~~!

24:06.887 --> 24:08.180
Please stop crying.

24:08.972 --> 24:09.973
Also...

24:12.059 --> 24:13.519
The handkerchief is mine.

24:32.455 --> 24:34.331
To be honest,

24:36.542 --> 24:41.088
I broke up with
my boyfriend yesterday.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.053
Excuse me.

24:47.678 --> 24:49.430
Wake up.

24:50.181 --> 24:53.351
Come on, wake up.

24:55.103 --> 24:57.730
Your fiances wasted again?

25:22.964 --> 25:25.091
What now?

25:25.175 --> 25:27.510
Sign you in like before, right?

25:30.972 --> 25:31.598
Yes.

25:33.141 --> 25:35.977
But mister, have any medicine
for alcohol?

25:37.020 --> 25:38.939
No, you buy it.

27:08.422 --> 27:10.090
I saw her lips.

27:12.134 --> 27:13.927
Her white neck.

27:16.180 --> 27:16.889
And...

27:19.725 --> 27:21.685
I saw her breast, too.

27:24.146 --> 27:29.109
While watching her
sleep like a baby,

27:29.902 --> 27:32.822
it may be forward,
but this occurred to me.

27:33.948 --> 27:37.535
I want to heal her sorrow.

28:02.477 --> 28:04.896
Give me some water.

28:11.444 --> 28:12.320
Hey.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.281
Why am I here?

28:17.200 --> 28:18.952
You see.

28:21.287 --> 28:23.206
I'm sorry,

28:24.290 --> 28:28.253
but I saw your lD,
and you're twenty-four.

28:28.336 --> 28:30.505
If you talk down on me again...

28:32.507 --> 28:34.926
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...

28:35.010 --> 28:36.219
Nothing.

28:36.303 --> 28:37.387
Give me the towel.

28:37.471 --> 28:42.434
Yes. You see, I'm a year older.

28:42.517 --> 28:44.811
Then talk like friends. Yeah?

28:44.853 --> 28:45.729
Toothbrush.

28:51.693 --> 28:52.653
Toothpaste?

28:52.694 --> 28:54.112
In the bathroom.

29:03.956 --> 29:06.417
Our relationship
is so peculiar.

29:07.042 --> 29:12.298
We met only three days ago,
and slept twice in a motel.

29:16.677 --> 29:20.389
That's how our
relationship began.

29:22.850 --> 29:23.309
Lee Hyung-chul.

29:23.392 --> 29:24.226
Here.

29:24.310 --> 29:25.186
Jeun Mi-young.

29:25.269 --> 29:25.936
Here.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.104
Kang Man-gyu.

29:27.188 --> 29:27.938
Yep.

29:28.606 --> 29:29.357
Gyeon-woo.

29:30.483 --> 29:31.359
Is he absent?

29:31.400 --> 29:32.193
No, no!

29:32.276 --> 29:33.736
I'm here!

29:33.819 --> 29:36.030
Then answer right away.

29:36.822 --> 29:37.615
Phew! Gonna be sucks!

29:37.698 --> 29:38.449
Lee Jeung-min.

29:38.533 --> 29:39.492
Here.

29:40.076 --> 29:40.868
Gu Seol-soo.

29:40.910 --> 29:42.161
Yes, I'm here.

30:38.135 --> 30:42.014
Professor. How about a break?

30:44.808 --> 30:48.270
You're right. Let's take a break.

30:50.939 --> 30:51.690
Let's go.

30:52.649 --> 30:55.277
Go where? Class isn't over yet.

30:55.360 --> 30:59.490
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?

31:00.157 --> 31:01.200
Let's go.

31:01.867 --> 31:04.828
I can't. I can't miss this class.

31:05.537 --> 31:06.914
Kill me instead.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.085
All right.

31:15.673 --> 31:18.050
Who is she? She's pretty.

31:18.884 --> 31:21.679
Pretty? Doesn't matter.

31:21.762 --> 31:23.848
A girl needs to act pretty.

31:23.931 --> 31:26.892
But she's still pretty.
Nice body, too.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.315
Who's Gyeon-woo?

31:34.817 --> 31:37.069
It's me, sir.

31:37.820 --> 31:41.949
I won't mark you absent
so you can leave.

31:43.201 --> 31:43.993
Pardon me?

31:44.077 --> 31:45.495
I said leave.

31:46.871 --> 31:47.747
Why?

31:47.830 --> 31:49.916
Wasn't that girl
your girlfriend?

31:52.252 --> 31:53.878
So go see her.

31:57.715 --> 31:58.800
Thank you, sir.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.763
Oh, Gyeon-woo.

32:05.181 --> 32:08.268
If you can, raise it with her.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.856
It worked.

32:15.108 --> 32:17.194
What did you tell him?

32:18.361 --> 32:20.280
That I'm getting an abortion,
and you're the father.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.033
What?

32:24.076 --> 32:27.996
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!

32:59.582 --> 33:02.168
She wanted
to be a scriptwriter,

33:02.251 --> 33:04.128
so she kept writing stories.

33:04.211 --> 33:06.422
She called them synopsis.

33:07.089 --> 33:11.344
To get me into the mood, she took me
to the park to read them.

33:12.720 --> 33:16.557
Reading her synopsis
was stressful.

33:17.266 --> 33:20.311
If I miss anything, I'm dead.

33:20.394 --> 33:23.147
Wanna die? Finish reading it.

33:27.944 --> 33:28.820
I will.

33:41.374 --> 33:44.878
Mister! How could
you throw the butt here?

33:44.961 --> 33:46.171
Pick it up!

33:50.133 --> 33:52.969
And why did you
wear that colour?

33:53.053 --> 33:56.222
Man on the street:
Then what about you?

33:56.306 --> 33:58.058
Don't wear the same
colour as mine!

33:58.141 --> 34:00.977
The heroine is
tough, like the 'Terminator'.

34:01.061 --> 34:03.188
The year is 2137.

34:03.271 --> 34:07.776
Villains kidnap her lover
and travels to the present.

34:07.859 --> 34:09.277
I don't know why.

34:09.319 --> 34:12.197
To save her lover,

34:12.280 --> 34:15.742
she travels in a time machine
to the present.

34:37.473 --> 34:39.933
Aaggggggghh~!

34:40.517 --> 34:43.520
Bang! Bang!

34:45.940 --> 34:47.024
Uuh~ ack!

34:56.200 --> 34:57.451
Fizz~ Bang!

35:03.040 --> 35:03.833
Click!

35:04.000 --> 35:04.750
Bang!

35:06.919 --> 35:08.337
Uuuaaaaahh~~~.

35:42.580 --> 35:46.876
Bang! Bang! Bang!

35:54.175 --> 35:56.052
They have to kiss in the end.

35:57.095 --> 36:01.308
This isn't a melodrama.
It's an action movie.

36:01.391 --> 36:03.560
You don't know movies.

36:03.602 --> 36:06.438
Koreans like melodramas.

36:06.521 --> 36:07.647
Why?

36:07.731 --> 36:12.152
Know what novel touched us
when we were teenagers?

36:12.235 --> 36:14.655
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.

36:14.738 --> 36:18.742
It shaped our people's
sensibility in their teens.

36:18.825 --> 36:22.746
Koreans like sad movies
all because of 'Shower'.

36:23.288 --> 36:26.375
Shower? What's sad about it?

36:26.959 --> 36:28.961
It's sad when she asked

36:29.002 --> 36:32.256
to be buried in the clothes
reminiscent of her love.

36:32.297 --> 36:34.758
I couldn't sleep for one week.

36:35.801 --> 36:36.927
The ending sucks.

36:37.928 --> 36:38.929
Gotta change it.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.431
How?

37:18.928 --> 37:23.141
It's sad. Her family couldn't afford
to pay for her medicine.

37:24.809 --> 37:28.354
Their family line
is broken up now.

37:32.901 --> 37:38.156
But you know, she must have
been an extraordinary girl.

37:38.865 --> 37:39.407
Why?

37:39.491 --> 37:41.034
This was her last request.

37:42.410 --> 37:46.164
When I die, please bury me
with my loving friend.

37:46.623 --> 37:47.499
What?

37:47.749 --> 37:50.126
To bury him alive, even.

37:50.544 --> 37:52.045
Oh, my gosh.

37:53.922 --> 37:56.258
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

38:04.558 --> 38:06.059
No way!

38:06.143 --> 38:11.940
This is wrong! This is wrong!

38:15.402 --> 38:16.987
This is wrong!

38:19.364 --> 38:21.992
Please. Don't!

38:24.036 --> 38:24.703
Bury him!

38:30.793 --> 38:34.797
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?

39:00.490 --> 39:01.908
I must be hurt still.

39:07.622 --> 39:13.586
I think I'll never get over him.

39:20.622 --> 39:21.873
How deep could it be?

39:24.459 --> 39:25.252
I don't know.

39:26.294 --> 39:28.421
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.

39:28.505 --> 39:30.757
I wanna know how deep it is.

39:32.926 --> 39:34.469
Come on.

39:35.804 --> 39:37.264
Uuaaaah~!

39:41.059 --> 39:45.564
Help me! Help me!

39:45.647 --> 39:47.733
Wow, it's deep.

39:49.193 --> 39:51.612
I can't swim!

39:55.741 --> 39:56.533
Yes, it's deep...

39:56.617 --> 39:59.286
My mind was getting blurry.

40:01.497 --> 40:02.456
At that moment...

40:11.201 --> 40:12.619
Heard you got a girlfriend.

40:13.350 --> 40:14.726
Introduce me.

40:15.310 --> 40:17.229
Really? I'm serious.

40:17.312 --> 40:18.688
Is she pretty?

40:19.064 --> 40:20.816
Have you kissed her?

40:21.316 --> 40:24.277
Girlfriend?

40:24.528 --> 40:26.989
Gonna introduce me or not?

40:28.699 --> 40:29.616
She really pretty?

40:31.535 --> 40:32.828
What are you looking at?

40:35.956 --> 40:37.833
See that girl over there?

40:38.542 --> 40:41.336
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?

41:10.866 --> 41:13.494
Hey...

41:13.577 --> 41:14.996
Excuse me...

41:15.538 --> 41:16.622
Hey, baby.

41:17.540 --> 41:21.252
Are you free? Hey?

41:22.003 --> 41:22.837
What?

41:23.421 --> 41:24.547
Baby?

41:26.132 --> 41:27.925
Hey! Come here.

41:37.977 --> 41:38.895
Hmm!

41:43.837 --> 41:48.466
How could
a coincidence like this happen?

41:49.259 --> 41:52.220
Reportedly say there is
an accident of runaway soldier...

41:57.309 --> 41:58.601
Hello?

42:02.460 --> 42:07.674
You call a wrong number
or the dial is not in service.

42:07.757 --> 42:10.427
Please, call again.

42:10.927 --> 42:15.390
You call a wrong number
or the dial is not in service.

42:15.474 --> 42:17.059
Please, call again.

42:20.655 --> 42:24.742
Let's drink. Drink till we die.

42:29.364 --> 42:30.615
Since I'm drunk,

42:30.991 --> 42:38.248
I decided to take revenge on her.

42:38.790 --> 42:42.586
If I'm out cold
at Bupyung station,

42:43.253 --> 42:47.466
then she'll have to carry
me on her back.

43:07.027 --> 43:11.198
This stop is Bupyung station...

43:17.538 --> 43:21.709
Hey, kid. Wake up. Wake up.

43:23.085 --> 43:25.588
Where am I?

44:11.176 --> 44:14.804
I'm at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.

44:32.948 --> 44:35.701
Wake up. Get up, idiot.

44:35.742 --> 44:39.037
Go away, buttbrain.

44:40.414 --> 44:41.707
Talking back?

44:42.416 --> 44:47.671
Get up, bastard! What the...

44:57.890 --> 44:59.141
How're you?

44:59.225 --> 45:01.435
Hi!

45:01.519 --> 45:03.312
How are you?

45:04.647 --> 45:06.690
Oh, how is it going?

45:07.274 --> 45:10.152
What? Go away, buttbrain?

45:11.487 --> 45:13.531
You got a bad mouth.

45:15.908 --> 45:19.537
I'll set you
straight the gangster's way.

45:19.620 --> 45:20.955
On your head.

45:24.125 --> 45:25.126
Get up.

45:26.919 --> 45:32.592
Sit down. Get up. Sit down.
Roll right. Roll left.

45:34.093 --> 45:36.387
Do it right. Keep going!

45:41.351 --> 45:44.270
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.

45:45.772 --> 45:51.485
Hey! You low-life thieves.

45:51.486 --> 45:53.196
What officer? Keep quiet.

45:53.279 --> 45:55.073
Low-life thieves?

45:56.741 --> 45:58.326
Damn it.

46:02.289 --> 46:06.626
Hey. Want some of this?
No thanks.

46:06.668 --> 46:08.295
Try it. It's delicious.

46:08.420 --> 46:10.589
No. Hey, boy.

46:11.298 --> 46:13.300
Pay attention to your elders.

46:13.341 --> 46:14.426
Eat it, buttbrain.

46:18.555 --> 46:22.517
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?

46:22.601 --> 46:25.646
Am I your toy? Leave me
alone you petty thieves!

46:25.729 --> 46:31.819
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It's humiliating!

46:33.695 --> 46:35.030
Oh, shit!

46:47.084 --> 46:48.836
Good morning.

46:51.714 --> 46:56.969
Keep quiet!
Thank you. Thank you.

47:05.144 --> 47:05.895
You bastard!

47:05.978 --> 47:08.272
Do that again, and you're dead.

47:08.356 --> 47:10.524
What? Are you free, baby?

47:10.608 --> 47:12.735
Your English is good, too.

47:14.737 --> 47:17.198
Better behave!

47:19.117 --> 47:20.326
Wanna die?

47:27.220 --> 47:28.137
Taste good?

47:29.681 --> 47:32.225
It's so delicious.

47:32.775 --> 47:37.071
If I sleep out, mom beats me with
whatever's in her hand.

47:37.155 --> 47:39.532
If she's sweeping,
it's a broom stick

47:39.616 --> 47:41.951
if she's cleaning,
it's a vacuum.

47:41.993 --> 47:45.663
When I'm lucky,
it's a cucumber or eggplant.

47:45.747 --> 47:49.292
So I have to come
at the right time.

48:12.923 --> 48:15.801
You're not looking
at dirty pictures, right?

48:16.510 --> 48:20.014
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?

48:20.097 --> 48:24.518
No, I do. Time for bed.

48:24.602 --> 48:27.522
Go to sleep. Good night, dad.

48:42.545 --> 48:45.757
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.468
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?

48:48.551 --> 48:53.139
Since I like you so much,
better make me smile like this.

48:53.223 --> 48:54.516
Got it?

48:56.101 --> 48:57.102
I got it.

48:58.270 --> 48:59.688
Phew~~.

48:59.771 --> 49:01.314
Her birthday.

49:01.940 --> 49:04.818
If I prepare nothing,
she may murder me.

49:05.735 --> 49:08.113
I have a good idea.

49:08.155 --> 49:11.825
Before going to the service,
I worked in a theme park.

49:11.908 --> 49:13.952
So this is my plan.

49:14.036 --> 49:18.582
At midnight, I'll be alone
with her in the park.

49:18.665 --> 49:21.960
It'll be completely dark
all around us.

49:22.002 --> 49:27.174
One by one, the lights
to the merry-go-round flick on.

49:27.257 --> 49:32.638
I raise my arms up there,
and her birthday song starts.

49:32.721 --> 49:36.058
Then all the lights turn on
and it moves.

49:36.141 --> 49:39.728
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?

49:39.812 --> 49:43.107
She'll be thrilled.

49:44.169 --> 49:48.382
I gave 200,000 won
to my friends working there.

49:48.757 --> 49:52.178
Jump over here?
Yeah. We have to.

49:52.344 --> 49:54.889
I always wanted to
come here at night.

49:56.057 --> 49:58.643
It's my birthday, not yours.

49:59.060 --> 50:01.604
Please, let's just try.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.357
I'll go up first and help you.

50:15.243 --> 50:19.831
Eh? There's a step here.

50:19.956 --> 50:22.417
Take my hand.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.878
Oh, shit!

50:27.005 --> 50:30.466
Shit!

50:31.301 --> 50:32.343
Gyeon-woo.

50:34.095 --> 50:34.804
Hey!

50:36.139 --> 50:41.770
Answer me.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

50:44.606 --> 50:49.569
Answer me! You're dead.

50:49.653 --> 50:50.946
Wait till I catch you.

50:58.495 --> 51:02.916
Why didn't you answer?

51:02.958 --> 51:04.209
Wanna die?

51:12.342 --> 51:13.176
Come with me!

51:40.591 --> 51:41.425
Hurry and get in.

51:45.429 --> 51:46.222
Shut up!

51:49.016 --> 51:52.770
Go in fast. Move it. Sit here.

51:52.853 --> 51:55.022
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?

51:55.106 --> 51:55.982
Yes.

51:56.274 --> 51:59.026
Answer quietly! Yes.

52:20.798 --> 52:22.133
Is that a real gun?

52:23.676 --> 52:26.596
Wanna see? Forget it.

52:33.895 --> 52:34.980
How are you two related?

52:35.063 --> 52:40.193
We're just friends.

52:46.687 --> 52:47.855
Why are you here?

52:48.698 --> 52:51.498
We just wanted to
come here at night.

52:51.571 --> 52:55.575
Tell me the truth, idiot.
Nothing special.

52:57.327 --> 52:58.745
Bullshit.

52:59.954 --> 53:01.790
What makes you
trust a guy like him?

53:05.335 --> 53:06.961
I trusted myself.

53:16.638 --> 53:18.098
I had a girlfriend, too.

53:20.684 --> 53:23.270
She visited me
every week for one year.

53:26.064 --> 53:27.691
I was so happy.

53:30.610 --> 53:37.701
But that bitch fell in love
with the guard house sergeant.

53:39.620 --> 53:45.459
I found out the fact
after he was discharged.

53:46.585 --> 53:48.670
Damn it.

53:49.963 --> 53:54.301
While I'm in the service,
even my dog...

53:55.135 --> 53:57.471
ran away with some mutt, too.

54:01.058 --> 54:05.604
My Yorkshire terrier. Bitch.

54:07.273 --> 54:13.154
Fuck. I came out to
kill both bitches. Fuck.

54:14.280 --> 54:18.242
I have the worst luck
in this world.

54:19.827 --> 54:21.913
Damn it.

54:25.183 --> 54:28.395
Know what special day
is it today?

54:28.687 --> 54:33.066
Huh, damn it? This sucks!

54:37.446 --> 54:40.741
Uuuuuuuhhh~ ack!

54:46.200 --> 54:51.539
Hey, what are the odds to meet
a runaway soldier in a park?

54:52.540 --> 54:53.583
Don't know.

54:53.666 --> 54:58.212
Heard your head blows up
if you shoot in the mouth.

54:58.296 --> 55:01.966
Yeah, the hole in your head
is this big.

55:02.050 --> 55:05.345
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?

55:05.386 --> 55:07.472
Yeah, the bullet tears the...

55:07.555 --> 55:11.518
Hey! What are you two doing?

55:12.727 --> 55:14.437
Stop joking around.

55:15.730 --> 55:19.651
Damn it. Damn it!

55:19.734 --> 55:22.195
Even you bastards ignore me.

55:22.279 --> 55:28.452
That's why don't be foolish.
Why am I foolish?

55:28.535 --> 55:31.830
Even if you do this,
she won't come back.

55:32.622 --> 55:34.916
I know. I know, too.

55:35.667 --> 55:39.796
But if I die,
she'll be heartbroken.

55:39.880 --> 55:42.174
She'll never be the same.

55:43.592 --> 55:44.801
You're wrong.

55:46.929 --> 55:50.808
The pain goes away
sooner than you think.

55:52.434 --> 55:53.936
You went through
something like this?

55:58.899 --> 56:04.530
Yeah. It happens that way.

56:06.115 --> 56:09.451
Damn it. If I'm caught,
I'll go to the can.

56:09.994 --> 56:11.662
I'll always think of her there.

56:11.745 --> 56:13.330
What does 'can' mean?

56:13.414 --> 56:15.291
It means prison.

56:15.374 --> 56:17.043
Don't interrupt. Sorry.

56:19.712 --> 56:24.258
Anyway, you're responsible
for your actions now.

56:26.155 --> 56:28.324
Excuse me, sir.

56:29.700 --> 56:31.327
How about letting her go?

56:35.248 --> 56:36.332
If I say no?

56:37.500 --> 56:38.835
Then...

56:42.255 --> 56:44.757
let me go, instead.

56:48.344 --> 56:50.805
Come to think of it,

56:50.847 --> 56:53.433
your eyebrows remind
me of that sergeant.

56:53.516 --> 56:54.767
You act like him, too.

56:55.143 --> 56:57.270
You can go.

56:57.353 --> 56:58.813
And you...

57:00.315 --> 57:02.525
We die together. Got it?

57:03.234 --> 57:04.069
Pardon?

57:04.819 --> 57:10.450
Hey, lady. Forget about this bastard,
and look for a nice guy. Got it?

57:10.533 --> 57:12.535
Go! Let's go together.

57:13.286 --> 57:14.412
All three of us.

57:17.123 --> 57:19.376
Will you leave if I kill him?

57:23.171 --> 57:27.467
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.

57:28.719 --> 57:31.430
This soldier isn't a bad guy.

57:33.015 --> 57:34.391
You'll come out safely.

57:35.517 --> 57:38.520
You're leaving me alone?

57:39.396 --> 57:40.772
There's no other way.

57:46.570 --> 57:50.157
I was afraid to die alone,
but I'm glad we're in it together.

58:08.342 --> 58:10.386
Oh, right.

58:10.428 --> 58:13.055
Over there,

58:13.139 --> 58:16.517
there's an exit near
the merry-go-round.

58:16.600 --> 58:18.102
Nobody knows about it.

58:18.769 --> 58:21.480
I used to work here.

58:21.564 --> 58:22.607
Really?

58:23.983 --> 58:25.234
You're not tricking me, right?

58:25.276 --> 58:27.487
I'm a man, too. Why would I?

58:31.115 --> 58:32.408
Walk in front of me.

58:38.790 --> 58:40.458
See? I told you so.

58:52.303 --> 58:53.012
This way!

58:53.096 --> 58:54.389
Shit!

59:08.195 --> 59:11.490
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.

59:12.365 --> 59:15.452
Screw you! Don't come closer!

59:16.286 --> 59:19.081
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!

59:26.088 --> 59:30.509
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!

59:31.510 --> 59:32.761
I'll give you an hour!

59:33.679 --> 59:38.308
If not, I'll kill him,
and myself, too!

59:38.350 --> 59:41.770
Got it? Hurry up!

59:41.854 --> 59:43.605
Sniper 2!

59:43.689 --> 59:46.025
The hostage is in danger,
but we can still fire.

59:52.781 --> 59:56.202
Don't! Wait! Don't shoot!

59:59.955 --> 1:00:02.249
Hey, soldier! I mean sir!

1:00:05.461 --> 1:00:07.254
Your girlfriend changed
her mind, right?

1:00:08.255 --> 1:00:10.007
Did you really love her?

1:00:12.385 --> 1:00:13.803
Ask yourself.

1:00:15.805 --> 1:00:17.473
I think you didn't.

1:00:19.642 --> 1:00:21.060
If you really love her,

1:00:22.186 --> 1:00:26.274
you should let her go.

1:00:27.442 --> 1:00:29.319
If not, then it's not love.

1:00:31.070 --> 1:00:34.908
What's wrong with someone
you don't love getting married?

1:00:37.660 --> 1:00:38.912
Stop this,

1:00:39.579 --> 1:00:41.664
and go back to
base as a real man.

1:00:45.043 --> 1:00:48.797
A person like you
should learn more about love.

1:00:51.967 --> 1:00:53.677
If we want to learn,

1:00:55.929 --> 1:00:58.181
then we should keep living.

1:01:03.937 --> 1:01:07.190
Damn it.

1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:10.235
She's the nicest girl I've met.

1:01:11.653 --> 1:01:16.158
Hey! Don't let her go. Got it?

1:01:18.619 --> 1:01:20.829
If you do, I'll take her.

1:01:26.460 --> 1:01:29.254
Can I go? Go. Screw it.

1:01:31.382 --> 1:01:32.424
Shit! Don't know.

1:01:37.137 --> 1:01:38.847
Pop! Pop!

1:01:49.316 --> 1:01:53.404
Thank you. Today's my birthday.

1:01:53.946 --> 1:01:56.449
I'll live on until
I learn what love is.

1:02:03.664 --> 1:02:07.376
What? We're just friends?

1:02:09.086 --> 1:02:12.507
No, I said that to save you.

1:02:14.967 --> 1:02:17.345
Let me go, instead?

1:02:18.471 --> 1:02:20.098
Wanted to save yourself, huh?

1:02:20.848 --> 1:02:23.101
He wouldn't have let you go.

1:02:23.184 --> 1:02:25.186
Stop lying!
Stop lying! Stop lying!

1:02:26.521 --> 1:02:29.023
Have a nice life alone.

1:02:31.025 --> 1:02:35.572
I screwed up her
birthday, but I feel good anyway.

1:02:35.739 --> 1:02:38.575
'Cause I'm proud
to be with her,

1:02:38.658 --> 1:02:40.952
and things turned
out as planned.

1:02:41.036 --> 1:02:43.538
I hope you believe in me.

1:02:44.539 --> 1:02:46.041
You can't?

1:02:46.333 --> 1:02:47.133
Wait...

1:02:49.878 --> 1:02:52.422
Second Half

1:03:22.317 --> 1:03:23.360
I remember.

1:03:24.361 --> 1:03:26.947
She always came
with him until last year.

1:03:30.117 --> 1:03:33.704
Was it last spring or winter?

1:03:34.663 --> 1:03:38.751
One day, she came alone
with flowers to ask a favour.

1:03:42.254 --> 1:03:46.842
To not let anyone
sit in his seat that day.

1:03:51.389 --> 1:03:52.265
What's up?

1:03:52.306 --> 1:03:54.475
Oh, hi.

1:03:55.184 --> 1:03:56.519
You're early.

1:03:57.144 --> 1:03:58.938
I was in the neighbourhood.

1:03:59.564 --> 1:04:00.731
Miss me?

1:04:01.315 --> 1:04:02.275
Of course!

1:04:03.818 --> 1:04:07.280
She always tried
hard to look cheery.

1:04:08.072 --> 1:04:11.326
I like her that way.
What would you like?

1:04:11.618 --> 1:04:12.452
Coke, please.

1:04:12.535 --> 1:04:14.662
Wanna die? Drink coffee.

1:04:15.371 --> 1:04:16.414
Two coffees, please.

1:04:16.497 --> 1:04:18.625
He he he~

1:04:18.708 --> 1:04:20.543
I know her.

1:04:20.627 --> 1:04:22.545
She pretends to be happy,

1:04:22.629 --> 1:04:25.965
but she's full of sorrow inside.

1:04:26.633 --> 1:04:29.511
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?

1:04:29.594 --> 1:04:32.055
No. It's nothing.

1:04:34.975 --> 1:04:36.226
Looks fun, huh?

1:04:39.062 --> 1:04:41.773
Another one?
Why? Don't wanna read it?

1:04:41.815 --> 1:04:43.733
She may get disappointed,

1:04:43.817 --> 1:04:47.654
but I should be
honest for her sake.

1:04:48.363 --> 1:04:51.283
Looks fun. I'll read it.

1:04:51.450 --> 1:04:52.868
Ha ha ha~.

1:05:01.346 --> 1:05:04.016
This time it's
a martial arts film.

1:05:09.521 --> 1:05:12.733
The heroine is a bounty hunter.

1:05:16.362 --> 1:05:20.074
The villain wears rain
slippers even on clear days.

1:05:20.699 --> 1:05:23.369
The worst of his kind.

1:05:31.001 --> 1:05:32.712
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?

1:05:32.795 --> 1:05:34.588
Gyeon-woo?

1:05:34.672 --> 1:05:36.924
The story's setting is a mess.

1:05:37.008 --> 1:05:39.885
Japan invades during
King Sejong's reign,

1:05:39.927 --> 1:05:43.014
and the king's father
is the tyrant Yeonsan.

1:05:46.809 --> 1:05:50.396
In the end, the heroine
fights the villain in a field.

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:53.524
Heavy rain pours
down on a sunny day.

1:06:00.990 --> 1:06:02.742
He he he~.

1:06:17.298 --> 1:06:20.260
Yaaaah~.

1:06:21.678 --> 1:06:23.680
Yup~!

1:06:55.838 --> 1:07:00.217
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.

1:07:00.801 --> 1:07:02.636
She's from the future, of course.

1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.471
It's fun, huh?

1:07:04.888 --> 1:07:08.684
Why is the heroine
always from the future?

1:07:08.976 --> 1:07:12.146
Science is advanced then,

1:07:12.354 --> 1:07:14.064
so they invent a time machine.

1:07:15.816 --> 1:07:18.819
And people go to
the past to travel.

1:07:20.029 --> 1:07:23.491
People from the future
could be here now.

1:07:23.699 --> 1:07:28.079
I think UFOs are time machines.

1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:32.542
Someday, I'll meet
someone from the future.

1:07:33.709 --> 1:07:34.710
I have to.

1:07:35.711 --> 1:07:39.465
If you do, ask him to take you.

1:07:40.174 --> 1:07:40.925
What?

1:07:41.509 --> 1:07:42.510
If it's possible...

1:07:43.219 --> 1:07:45.471
Give this to Shin Cine.

1:07:46.097 --> 1:07:50.310
Tell them to cast
Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.

1:07:50.393 --> 1:07:52.020
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.

1:07:52.123 --> 1:07:56.002
Excuse me,
we talked on the phone, right?

1:07:56.961 --> 1:07:59.547
Well... this is
'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...

1:08:27.676 --> 1:08:31.096
On the way, we
play fun games, too.

1:08:33.265 --> 1:08:36.434
Left foot over the line, I win.

1:08:36.518 --> 1:08:40.272
With the right foot, you win.

1:08:40.355 --> 1:08:41.314
What's the prize?

1:08:43.608 --> 1:08:44.317
Let's see...

1:08:46.987 --> 1:08:47.988
How about a kiss?

1:08:48.030 --> 1:08:49.364
A kiss?

1:08:50.365 --> 1:08:51.491
Wanna die?

1:08:52.701 --> 1:08:53.535
You choose.

1:08:55.662 --> 1:08:56.622
Hitting each other.

1:08:57.706 --> 1:08:58.832
Again?

1:08:59.625 --> 1:09:01.043
You can hit me, too.

1:09:02.461 --> 1:09:03.420
Okay.

1:09:05.214 --> 1:09:05.881
Someone's coming.

1:09:24.358 --> 1:09:26.235
Ha ha ha~~~~~!

1:09:31.032 --> 1:09:32.992
I think this is unfair.

1:09:33.993 --> 1:09:36.412
I'm a girl, so I'll
slap the cheek.

1:09:37.246 --> 1:09:39.832
No. Then I'll change it, too.

1:09:40.666 --> 1:09:44.170
But I'm a girl.
Men and women are equal.

1:09:46.255 --> 1:09:50.426
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.

1:09:50.510 --> 1:09:53.429
Go easy on me,
and I'll kill you.

1:09:53.471 --> 1:09:55.139
Better slap me on the cheek.

1:09:55.223 --> 1:09:57.433
If you don't, I'll kill you!

1:10:00.436 --> 1:10:01.396
All right.

1:10:02.063 --> 1:10:04.566
You slap, and I'll use my finger.

1:10:04.607 --> 1:10:06.901
Right, that's fair.

1:10:07.777 --> 1:10:09.112
Saw that?

1:10:09.195 --> 1:10:12.532
See that guy step over
with his left foot?

1:10:12.605 --> 1:10:15.358
I had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.

1:10:15.442 --> 1:10:16.776
I thought it was this way.

1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:18.778
Shut up. Here they come.

1:10:22.115 --> 1:10:24.242
Left foot. Left foot.

1:10:31.458 --> 1:10:32.751
It'll be the right foot.

1:10:32.834 --> 1:10:37.923
Left! Left!
Switch to the right.

1:10:45.973 --> 1:10:49.059
You have to hit me?

1:10:49.235 --> 1:10:53.657
Come here. Stay still.
Ugh! Uh uh uh~!

1:11:02.322 --> 1:11:03.532
When I'm with her,

1:11:03.605 --> 1:11:06.441
I never know how
the day will turn out.

1:11:30.257 --> 1:11:30.966
What?

1:11:31.050 --> 1:11:32.593
What are you looking at?

1:11:57.493 --> 1:11:59.370
I quit!

1:11:59.996 --> 1:12:01.706
Is your face a racket?

1:12:05.710 --> 1:12:09.172
Why does the ball
always hit my face?

1:12:10.423 --> 1:12:11.799
It's strange.

1:12:13.509 --> 1:12:15.053
Ugh~!

1:12:32.487 --> 1:12:35.782
I never want to lose a game.

1:12:36.741 --> 1:12:39.744
So I play until I win.

1:13:05.228 --> 1:13:08.190
Aaaaaaaaah~!

1:13:11.652 --> 1:13:13.195
Ugh!

1:13:33.424 --> 1:13:34.758
Wait long?

1:13:34.925 --> 1:13:36.594
Just a teeny bit.

1:14:04.247 --> 1:14:07.250
My mom bought me these heels,

1:14:07.792 --> 1:14:11.129
but they're killing my feet.

1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:13.798
Want a massage?

1:14:13.881 --> 1:14:15.842
No, it's okay.

1:14:15.925 --> 1:14:17.802
Instead, let's exchange shoes.

1:14:21.181 --> 1:14:22.348
Don't wanna?

1:14:23.308 --> 1:14:25.727
How can a guy wear heels?

1:14:25.810 --> 1:14:27.645
It'll fit.

1:14:29.898 --> 1:14:31.441
But, I can't...

1:14:32.984 --> 1:14:36.613
Yeah? I see.

1:14:37.197 --> 1:14:44.079
Come on. I'll buy you some sneakers.

1:14:44.162 --> 1:14:45.622
Forget it.

1:14:47.124 --> 1:14:51.378
Then wear mine,
and I'll carry yours.

1:14:51.461 --> 1:14:52.921
You don't understand women.

1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:57.301
Okay! Let's exchange.

1:14:59.636 --> 1:15:00.554
Really?

1:15:15.444 --> 1:15:18.197
Wanna know a secret?

1:15:19.448 --> 1:15:20.324
What is it?

1:15:20.366 --> 1:15:24.286
I don't wear panties on exam day.

1:15:24.870 --> 1:15:27.706
But I had one today.

1:15:29.250 --> 1:15:30.960
Catch me, honey!

1:15:37.550 --> 1:15:40.553
Hey. If you don't, I'll kill you.

1:15:41.429 --> 1:15:45.516
Phew~ Catch me, honey~!

1:15:47.059 --> 1:15:47.977
Stop right there!

1:15:50.062 --> 1:15:50.855
Stop!

1:16:23.555 --> 1:16:24.347
Out!

1:17:09.601 --> 1:17:15.316
It was just a second, but I
felt something in her eyes.

1:17:20.321 --> 1:17:21.947
That's my house.

1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:29.705
Wait. I'll bring you an umbrella.

1:17:30.331 --> 1:17:34.502
I'm okay. I'm already
wet so I'll just leave.

1:18:12.207 --> 1:18:16.336
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?

1:18:19.214 --> 1:18:20.006
Yes, sir.

1:18:20.090 --> 1:18:22.842
How much do you know
about my daughter?

1:18:27.430 --> 1:18:29.182
Not much...

1:18:37.733 --> 1:18:41.028
Next time, don't hang out till late.

1:18:48.535 --> 1:18:50.871
You don't understand me.

1:18:50.913 --> 1:18:53.207
Why'd you stand him up?

1:18:53.248 --> 1:18:56.543
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?

1:18:56.627 --> 1:18:59.380
And what happened to your heels?

1:18:59.421 --> 1:19:01.382
What's wrong with you?

1:19:01.423 --> 1:19:04.218
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.

1:19:04.301 --> 1:19:07.555
He's dumb and has no future.

1:19:07.638 --> 1:19:09.265
It's none of your business.

1:19:09.348 --> 1:19:10.891
Why is he stupid?

1:19:10.975 --> 1:19:14.061
You're stupid so you don't know.

1:19:14.145 --> 1:19:16.105
What has gotten in to you?

1:19:16.147 --> 1:19:18.107
Let me live my own life!

1:19:35.208 --> 1:19:36.542
Afterwards,

1:19:36.959 --> 1:19:39.796
I didn't hear
from her for a long time.

1:19:43.508 --> 1:19:45.677
Hello? Gyeon-woo, it's me.

1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:46.719
Long time no see.

1:19:46.803 --> 1:19:49.389
Her voice sounds cheerful
as if nothing happened to her.

1:19:49.472 --> 1:19:52.767
Our 100th day celebration
is soon.

1:19:52.809 --> 1:19:54.686
It's 100 days already?

1:19:54.769 --> 1:19:57.397
When do you think
a girl's the prettiest?

1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:02.444
When a sexy woman is naked.

1:20:02.527 --> 1:20:05.322
Where are you now?
Stay right there.

1:20:05.405 --> 1:20:09.200
No, I'm just kidding.

1:20:10.076 --> 1:20:12.996
The prettiest is when she's
playing the piano.

1:20:13.705 --> 1:20:15.207
What's your favorite song?

1:20:15.290 --> 1:20:18.168
That George Winston song.

1:20:22.547 --> 1:20:23.757
Pachelbel Canon?

1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:25.801
Yeah, that song.

1:20:25.884 --> 1:20:27.594
You're not gonna ask me?

1:20:27.878 --> 1:20:31.882
When is the guy the prettiest?

1:20:31.965 --> 1:20:34.176
Just give me a rose.

1:20:34.259 --> 1:20:36.386
Still have your high school uniform?

1:20:36.470 --> 1:20:38.889
Yeah. Why?

1:20:38.972 --> 1:20:41.725
Bring it on our 100th day,

1:20:41.808 --> 1:20:44.436
and give me a rose
during my class.

1:20:44.519 --> 1:20:46.146
Do it yourself, okay?

1:20:46.229 --> 1:20:50.150
What? What did you say?
How can I during class?

1:20:50.776 --> 1:20:54.404
Hey! Just hung up on me!
Damn it!

1:20:58.534 --> 1:21:00.703
I don't wanna get beaten by her,

1:21:01.578 --> 1:21:04.164
or get humiliated
at a women's college.

1:21:06.483 --> 1:21:08.860
I'm cleverer than I look.

1:21:08.902 --> 1:21:10.904
These girls sure
love Chinese food.

1:21:10.987 --> 1:21:14.700
Hey, you! Where you headed?
Come here!

1:21:14.783 --> 1:21:16.868
I'm delivering Chinese food.

1:21:17.661 --> 1:21:19.329
I ordered it. Bring it here.

1:21:19.872 --> 1:21:21.206
Really?

1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:23.083
Bring a lot of radish?

1:21:25.419 --> 1:21:26.962
Oh, I forgot something!

1:21:27.045 --> 1:21:30.174
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!

1:21:30.883 --> 1:21:32.092
There's another customer.

1:21:32.176 --> 1:21:33.052
Hey!

1:24:26.186 --> 1:24:28.021
But that wasn't enough for her.

1:24:31.608 --> 1:24:34.694
We relived our old
high school days.

1:25:26.417 --> 1:25:32.131
After we visited that club, a school
uniform party was held every month.

1:25:34.383 --> 1:25:35.885
But she got wasted again.

1:25:38.513 --> 1:25:39.889
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.

1:25:39.972 --> 1:25:41.766
Let's prevent AIDS.

1:25:46.354 --> 1:25:47.021
Taxi!

1:26:00.201 --> 1:26:03.246
She's having a happy dream.

1:26:04.205 --> 1:26:08.793
Compared to when I looked at her
in the motel the first time,

1:26:08.877 --> 1:26:10.754
She looks so different.

1:26:11.421 --> 1:26:14.591
Could her pain be cured now?

1:26:15.634 --> 1:26:21.598
Maybe it means that she doesn't
need me anymore.

1:26:23.767 --> 1:26:31.441
Excuse me. Can you drive slowly?

1:26:39.199 --> 1:26:41.535
Here.

1:27:08.062 --> 1:27:09.897
Have any plans after graduation?

1:27:10.439 --> 1:27:14.068
Actually, I've never
thought about it yet.

1:27:15.152 --> 1:27:17.822
Can I see what's in your pocket?

1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:21.367
Sir? Right.

1:27:52.222 --> 1:27:54.432
What is this for?

1:27:55.225 --> 1:28:01.815
Oh, right. I learned that
it prevents AIDS.

1:28:02.565 --> 1:28:04.693
But I haven't used it yet.

1:28:06.236 --> 1:28:08.947
Actually, on the way here.
Forget it.

1:28:14.494 --> 1:28:18.957
'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?

1:28:19.750 --> 1:28:26.590
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.

1:28:28.842 --> 1:28:32.095
'We'll satisfy all your wishes?'

1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:37.100
I think it's to
satisfy our tastes.

1:28:56.851 --> 1:28:58.519
How do feel about our daughter?

1:29:01.981 --> 1:29:07.069
Oh, right. We're just friends now.

1:29:07.528 --> 1:29:08.821
Please don't worry.

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:13.659
If we get closer,
I'll let you know, sir.

1:29:14.493 --> 1:29:16.370
Don't see her any more.

1:29:20.301 --> 1:29:23.221
After that day, she never calls me.

1:29:24.889 --> 1:29:29.852
It was sudden,
but that's how we broke up.

1:29:33.272 --> 1:29:39.279
We're broken up. Now, I'm free.

1:29:57.589 --> 1:30:00.800
It's me. Come to the cafe
by seven o'clock.

1:30:01.927 --> 1:30:02.594
Why?

1:30:03.428 --> 1:30:06.848
What? I have a blind date today.

1:30:07.724 --> 1:30:08.683
Come in 45 minutes.

1:30:09.935 --> 1:30:11.228
I have a blind date, too.

1:30:25.784 --> 1:30:26.910
Are you on your way?

1:30:27.411 --> 1:30:29.246
I'm on a date with a girl.

1:30:29.288 --> 1:30:30.164
Hurry up.

1:30:40.257 --> 1:30:43.594
I have to go to the bathroom.

1:30:47.848 --> 1:30:50.142
'Gotta go to the bathroom.'

1:31:05.344 --> 1:31:06.345
Eh?

1:31:28.838 --> 1:31:29.672
Nice to meet you.

1:31:30.475 --> 1:31:32.227
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.

1:31:32.310 --> 1:31:34.562
Same here. Have a seat.

1:31:43.363 --> 1:31:45.824
Were you really with a girl?

1:31:48.618 --> 1:31:51.371
No, I was with a guy.

1:31:54.791 --> 1:31:55.500
Can I take your order?

1:31:56.877 --> 1:31:57.711
Coffee, please.

1:31:59.004 --> 1:32:00.380
You can drink coke.

1:32:02.674 --> 1:32:03.508
I'll drink coffee.

1:32:07.346 --> 1:32:10.182
Gyeon-woo. You're very lucky.

1:32:11.109 --> 1:32:15.113
I heard a lot about you.
That you're close friend.

1:32:18.742 --> 1:32:19.243
Friend...

1:32:24.920 --> 1:32:25.921
I need to go to the bathroom.

1:32:39.812 --> 1:32:40.563
Where's Gyeon-woo?

1:32:41.814 --> 1:32:42.732
He left already.

1:32:44.484 --> 1:32:47.445
He told me ten rules to follow.

1:32:48.696 --> 1:32:51.074
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.

1:32:53.159 --> 1:32:59.666
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...

1:32:59.749 --> 1:33:03.336
Second, don't let her drink
over three glasses.

1:33:03.753 --> 1:33:05.296
She'll beat someone.

1:33:06.506 --> 1:33:11.386
At a cafe, drink coffee
instead of coke or juice.

1:33:12.637 --> 1:33:16.391
If she hits you,
act like it hurts.

1:33:17.017 --> 1:33:19.185
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.

1:33:21.146 --> 1:33:25.108
On your 100th day together,

1:33:25.859 --> 1:33:27.819
give her a rose
during her class.

1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:29.988
She'll like it a lot.

1:33:31.072 --> 1:33:32.741
Make sure you learn
fencing and squash.

1:33:34.576 --> 1:33:37.412
Also, be prepared to
go to prison sometimes.

1:33:38.538 --> 1:33:39.915
If she says she'll kill you,

1:33:41.166 --> 1:33:44.253
don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.

1:33:45.420 --> 1:33:49.091
If her feet hurts,
exchange shoes with her.

1:33:49.967 --> 1:33:55.139
Finally, she likes to write.

1:33:56.724 --> 1:33:58.100
Encourage her.

1:35:18.807 --> 1:35:24.813
Ladies and gentlemen,
please pay attention to here...

1:35:24.896 --> 1:35:25.939
Gyeon-woo.

1:35:28.984 --> 1:35:33.155
Step backward on the yellow line...

1:35:33.238 --> 1:35:33.905
Gyeon-woo!

1:35:37.367 --> 1:35:44.124
After passenger's
getting off, take in order...

1:35:44.208 --> 1:35:44.750
Gyeon-woo!

1:35:49.004 --> 1:35:53.676
Please use the next train.

1:35:57.179 --> 1:35:58.430
What's his name?

1:35:58.514 --> 1:36:00.808
Gyeon-woo. I'll do it myself.

1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:12.236
Gyeon-woo. Where are you?
I looked all over for you.

1:36:16.198 --> 1:36:20.953
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator. Okay?

1:36:21.621 --> 1:36:23.998
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.

1:36:46.866 --> 1:36:48.034
Who told you to hug me?

1:36:57.513 --> 1:37:00.016
Dummy. You're supposed to dodge.

1:37:04.854 --> 1:37:09.734
Sometimes I feel like I know her
and sometimes I don't.

1:37:10.652 --> 1:37:14.197
We're definitely standing
at the crossroad now.

1:37:15.448 --> 1:37:17.075
What's going on between us?

1:37:18.285 --> 1:37:21.788
Can this relationship
last forever?

1:37:43.352 --> 1:37:44.144
Who is it?

1:37:47.356 --> 1:37:48.524
It's me, Dad.

1:38:10.045 --> 1:38:13.382
She told me to write a letter
and bring it.

1:38:14.175 --> 1:38:15.968
To write it on paper.

1:38:17.595 --> 1:38:19.972
To express my feelings,

1:38:20.473 --> 1:38:22.391
I tried hard to find
the right words.

1:38:24.769 --> 1:38:26.270
When I first met her,

1:38:26.938 --> 1:38:30.399
I wanted to cure her grief,

1:38:31.192 --> 1:38:33.569
but now I can't give her up.

1:38:34.529 --> 1:38:38.157
I wish we can get serious.

1:38:39.075 --> 1:38:41.995
I'm writing about
these feelings.

1:38:42.954 --> 1:38:45.999
She's probably
writing about me now.

1:38:47.876 --> 1:38:52.297
This is how we're
preparing to split up.

1:39:12.734 --> 1:39:13.527
Gyeon-woo.

1:39:15.403 --> 1:39:17.239
See that mountain top?

1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:19.366
Yeah.

1:39:21.076 --> 1:39:23.745
Could someone
hear me from there?

1:39:25.455 --> 1:39:31.545
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.

1:39:33.255 --> 1:39:36.341
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.

1:39:36.633 --> 1:39:38.093
If you hear, answer me.

1:39:40.304 --> 1:39:42.055
You want me to go over there?

1:39:43.932 --> 1:39:44.725
Yeah.

1:39:58.405 --> 1:39:59.615
Gyeon-woo?

1:40:01.117 --> 1:40:02.201
Can you hear me?

1:40:04.912 --> 1:40:15.798
Gyeon-woo! I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.

1:40:18.342 --> 1:40:29.395
Gyeon-woo. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry... I can't help it.

1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:37.018
I thought I was different,
but I'm just a helpless girl.

1:40:40.762 --> 1:40:43.362
Gyeon-woo! I'm sorry.

1:41:09.666 --> 1:41:10.834
Did you bring your letter?

1:41:11.835 --> 1:41:12.419
Yeah.

1:41:16.590 --> 1:41:18.467
What's that?

1:41:19.801 --> 1:41:20.928
A time capsule.

1:41:23.722 --> 1:41:27.434
We put our letters
in it and bury it here.

1:41:29.645 --> 1:41:34.233
And two years later,
let's meet here again.

1:41:35.182 --> 1:41:39.019
We'll read the letters that day,

1:41:40.354 --> 1:41:42.523
and maybe we can
find an answer then.

1:41:44.128 --> 1:41:46.630
This was her way of saying good-bye,

1:41:47.266 --> 1:41:53.522
and I kept repeating in my mind
that two years isn't long.

1:42:13.084 --> 1:42:21.509
Let's open this exactly
two years later, at two, Okay?

1:42:58.797 --> 1:43:02.092
We can meet two years later.

1:43:02.968 --> 1:43:08.098
When we meet then, we'll be
different from what we are now.

1:43:09.057 --> 1:43:12.102
We may become closer,

1:43:12.978 --> 1:43:14.771
or stay forever apart.

1:43:15.147 --> 1:43:18.066
We can only choose one.

1:43:41.445 --> 1:43:44.198
Gyeon-woo. You go first.

1:43:44.401 --> 1:43:45.694
Let's separate here.

1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:03.025
See you two years later!

1:44:03.140 --> 1:44:04.517
Okay, in two years!

1:44:04.642 --> 1:44:05.518
Two years!

1:44:08.563 --> 1:44:09.355
Bye!

1:44:43.014 --> 1:44:45.058
Gyeon-woo!

1:44:58.429 --> 1:45:01.557
That's how we broke up.

1:45:06.270 --> 1:45:09.231
Overtime

1:45:10.512 --> 1:45:14.975
I couldn't endure the loneliness
after we broke up.

1:45:16.185 --> 1:45:17.603
Thinking of those memories,

1:45:18.354 --> 1:45:22.233
I started to write about
our stories on the Internet.

1:45:23.756 --> 1:45:25.591
Then I made up my mind.

1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:30.773
If I meet her again,
I'll show her a different myself.

1:45:31.764 --> 1:45:37.228
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.

1:45:44.642 --> 1:45:48.813
Why does the ball I hit keep
hitting my face?

1:46:14.869 --> 1:46:19.457
I wrote our stories on the
Internet everyday,

1:46:20.584 --> 1:46:24.171
and I kept myself
busy for two years.

1:46:41.470 --> 1:46:49.311
Excuse me. I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.

1:46:49.770 --> 1:46:53.315
Shin Cine saw my writing,

1:46:53.732 --> 1:46:56.860
and offered to make
a movie out of it.

1:46:57.778 --> 1:47:00.864
I made her dream
come true instead.

1:47:01.647 --> 1:47:05.109
I wanted to tell her
right away,

1:47:05.526 --> 1:47:07.945
but I can only wait
till that day.

1:47:10.434 --> 1:47:12.018
She didn't come.

1:47:13.103 --> 1:47:15.564
It's our only day to meet.

1:47:16.835 --> 1:47:19.338
No one knows
when she will come.

1:48:12.305 --> 1:48:14.056
How did he get in here?

1:48:14.849 --> 1:48:15.975
It's a mystery.

1:48:32.784 --> 1:48:35.703
Gyeon-woo! How are you?

1:48:37.163 --> 1:48:40.708
I was so happy
while being with you.

1:48:41.668 --> 1:48:47.799
I'm not sure if you knew,
but the person I loved passed away.

1:48:49.467 --> 1:48:51.177
The day when I first met you

1:48:51.678 --> 1:48:55.348
was the day he died a year ago.

1:48:57.350 --> 1:49:02.355
Actually, I tried to
look for him in you.

1:49:03.752 --> 1:49:07.464
I know it was wrong. I'm sorry.

1:49:14.399 --> 1:49:18.570
I also met him on
the subway like you.

1:49:20.739 --> 1:49:23.158
I was really sick at that time.

1:49:26.265 --> 1:49:34.815
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.

1:49:42.219 --> 1:49:45.556
Under this tree, we planned
our future together.

1:49:47.628 --> 1:49:51.090
But he suddenly passed away.

1:49:52.425 --> 1:49:57.597
While I was dating you,
I met his mother often.

1:49:59.932 --> 1:50:02.685
She wanted to introduce
a nice man to me,

1:50:03.645 --> 1:50:04.979
but I couldn't.

1:50:09.067 --> 1:50:13.404
The day I first met you,
I came under this tree,

1:50:14.614 --> 1:50:16.407
and I prayed to him.

1:50:17.283 --> 1:50:18.993
To let me free.

1:50:21.121 --> 1:50:24.624
When I met you,
this occurred to me.

1:50:25.428 --> 1:50:29.015
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.

1:50:30.100 --> 1:50:32.018
But the more I met you,

1:50:33.174 --> 1:50:37.137
he seemed to grow
jealous of you in me.

1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:44.895
The more I liked you,
I felt guilty inside.

1:50:46.271 --> 1:50:49.399
While the two of us are apart,

1:50:49.983 --> 1:50:52.402
I want to forget him alone.

1:50:57.241 --> 1:51:01.703
After that day, I went often to
this place.

1:51:03.747 --> 1:51:07.418
If I'm not with you
after two years,

1:51:08.001 --> 1:51:09.586
it means I still lack of courage.

1:51:11.005 --> 1:51:14.425
How much will we change
after two years?

1:51:16.919 --> 1:51:18.962
I feel like you live
in the future,

1:51:19.755 --> 1:51:21.757
and I stay in the past.

1:51:24.301 --> 1:51:25.511
I want to meet you soon,

1:51:26.595 --> 1:51:28.222
so I can read your letter.

1:52:16.813 --> 1:52:18.857
Why are you staring at me, sir?

1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:25.864
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.

1:52:30.493 --> 1:52:32.162
Do you come here often?

1:52:32.746 --> 1:52:37.751
Sometimes. This tree has a secret.

1:52:39.878 --> 1:52:42.047
I have a secret here, too.

1:52:42.923 --> 1:52:43.799
Really?

1:52:46.468 --> 1:52:52.099
Three years ago, I buried a letter
here with my boyfriend.

1:52:54.977 --> 1:52:56.561
What's your secret?

1:52:56.895 --> 1:52:57.854
So what happened?

1:53:00.148 --> 1:53:04.278
We promised to read
the letters a year ago.

1:53:07.072 --> 1:53:08.699
But I couldn't come.

1:53:10.284 --> 1:53:11.910
I guess you're a year late.

1:53:15.164 --> 1:53:17.708
But two years didn't seem that long.

1:53:20.711 --> 1:53:22.796
I haven't made any decision yet.

1:53:26.008 --> 1:53:28.344
I just wasted my time
on stupid thoughts.

1:53:29.386 --> 1:53:30.638
Like what?

1:53:35.017 --> 1:53:36.852
If we were destined to meet,

1:53:38.980 --> 1:53:41.232
I thought we'd meet
by chance somewhere.

1:53:43.484 --> 1:53:45.152
Know what fate is?

1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:52.076
Building a bridge of chance
for someone you love.

1:53:57.874 --> 1:54:03.963
To be honest,
I read you guys letters.

1:54:07.091 --> 1:54:09.511
I said this tree
had a secret, right?

1:54:09.886 --> 1:54:10.512
Yes.

1:54:12.472 --> 1:54:19.312
Look closely. Does this tree
look the same as before?

1:54:30.198 --> 1:54:35.245
Well, it looks like it
changed a bit. But I'm not sure.

1:54:37.289 --> 1:54:40.333
People are dead or alive.

1:54:41.376 --> 1:54:45.172
There's a dead tree
and a living tree, too.

1:54:47.299 --> 1:54:51.261
This tree was struck dead
by lightning last year.

1:54:52.638 --> 1:54:54.264
It was split into two.

1:54:57.726 --> 1:55:01.814
But this young man felt sorry for it.

1:55:03.482 --> 1:55:05.526
During this spring,

1:55:06.402 --> 1:55:12.700
he planted another tree
that looked the same.

1:55:15.244 --> 1:55:17.746
When he planted the tree,

1:55:18.289 --> 1:55:24.086
he asked me if it look the same.

1:55:25.796 --> 1:55:29.842
He said that someone
would be sad if it died,

1:55:31.594 --> 1:55:34.931
so no one should know.

1:55:37.808 --> 1:55:38.518
Gyeon-woo...

1:56:11.527 --> 1:56:15.489
You call a wrong number
or the dial is not in service.

1:56:17.614 --> 1:56:18.824
Please, call again.

1:57:58.366 --> 1:57:58.908
Hi.

1:58:05.456 --> 1:58:09.627
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.

1:58:10.295 --> 1:58:13.006
You still look young.
How have you been?

1:58:13.653 --> 1:58:14.904
You were in England?

1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:18.199
Yes. For one and a half years.

1:58:22.787 --> 1:58:26.124
So I can forget him.

1:58:31.421 --> 1:58:35.175
I see. Feel better?

1:58:35.300 --> 1:58:37.678
Yes. A lot better.

1:58:38.230 --> 1:58:39.731
Is it true now?

1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:42.693
My son might be sad.

1:58:43.235 --> 1:58:46.864
He won't.
He'll like it this way.

1:58:50.586 --> 1:58:55.215
Good,
that's what I really hoped.

1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:57.948
Auntie! I was getting
my photo taken.

1:58:58.073 --> 1:59:02.161
You naughty boy.

1:59:03.245 --> 1:59:04.997
Know how long it's been?

1:59:05.789 --> 1:59:07.625
Sorry I didn't tell you before.

1:59:07.750 --> 1:59:11.337
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?

1:59:12.014 --> 1:59:13.557
When you had a hard time,

1:59:13.974 --> 1:59:18.145
I tried to introduce you
to him for several years,

1:59:18.511 --> 1:59:20.554
but he kept getting out of it.

1:59:22.088 --> 1:59:23.631
Heard you came to Bupyung often,

1:59:24.757 --> 1:59:26.884
but you never visited me?

1:59:33.796 --> 1:59:34.922
Go out with him.

1:59:36.132 --> 1:59:40.303
I thought he'd make
things easy for you.

1:59:42.055 --> 1:59:45.767
Oh, yeah. Gyeon-woo,
you're going to England, right?

1:59:46.726 --> 1:59:51.439
She's already been there,
so she can give you some tips.

1:59:53.608 --> 1:59:57.403
I don't have to go now.

1:59:58.988 --> 2:00:06.538
Why? You two know each other?

2:00:10.083 --> 2:00:15.297
You may not believe it, but I think I
met a man from the future.

2:00:17.007 --> 2:00:18.466
From your future.

2:00:24.347 --> 2:00:27.017
This is how I met her again.

2:00:27.768 --> 2:00:29.353
Think it's too coincidental?

2:00:30.020 --> 2:00:34.983
It's building a bridge
of chance for your love.

2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:43.080
