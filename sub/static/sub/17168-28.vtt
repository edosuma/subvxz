01:26.353 --> 01:28.787
I can't feel my butt.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.923
I too have no feelings

01:31.925 --> 01:33.792
Quick, someone smack mine.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.194
Again.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.329
Nothing!

01:37.331 --> 01:39.197
I feel nothing!

01:39.199 --> 01:42.033
Those whoopee cushions
were too strong!

01:42.035 --> 01:44.169
I just wanted a good
clean toot sound.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.838
(GROWLS) Well, you
paralyzed our butts, fool!

01:46.840 --> 01:49.808
Our behinds shall
never again feel

I... I'm sorry, Star.

01:59.986 --> 02:03.254
No. (SNIFFLES) It was supposed
to be a harmless prank.

That's good. That's good fun.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.843
Fun? You were crying.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.378
It was fun crying.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.880
Because it was just a
hilarious April Fools' prank.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.383
What's fun about making
your friends look dumb?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.084
I shall demonstrate.

You see, Raven?

02:46.433 --> 02:48.466
Uh, you just humiliated him.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.769
But in the fun way. See?

02:51.470 --> 02:53.304
Fun.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.240
These "fun"
April Fools' pranks

02:55.242 --> 02:57.809
are just excuses to be
cruel to your friends.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.444
No one likes being the
butt of a joke.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.646
Especially me.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.181
I hear you, Mama. I hears you.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.383
Uh, we promise
not to prank you.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.185
-Shake on it.
-No.

-Gum?
-No.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.321
-Peanuts?
-No.

03:10.323 --> 03:12.891
Would you care to smell
this nice flower

03:12.893 --> 03:14.759
that does definitely
not spray the...

03:14.761 --> 03:16.094
No. I'm leaving.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.495
And if you guys are smart

03:17.497 --> 03:20.465
you'll stop with this
April Fools nonsense.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.233
I'm serious.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.436
Maybe she's right.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.604
The pranks do seem the cruel.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.773
It's not fun if
people get hurt.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.341
Then let's agree right now,

03:30.343 --> 03:31.710
no more pranks. Deal?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.344
-Deal.

when someone walks
right into this tape.

They're gonna look so dumb.

Robin, we have found
something most serious.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.076
What is it?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.078

they're here, man.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.913

a downer, Raven.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.079
It's all in good fun! (SOBS)

04:42.481 --> 04:44.549

to the wolf again.

on your leg,

06:33.426 --> 06:35.059
so funny.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.500
Guys, these pranks aren't fun.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.102
You're just treating
each other horribly

06:44.104 --> 06:45.904
and it's made you
super paranoid.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.872
We're not paranoid, Mama.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.073
I'm watching you!

Great. 'Cause I'm
watching you.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.978
And you and you.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.914
I've been watching you
all for years.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.348

who watches,

This is fun?

Being suspicious
of your friends

07:04.024 --> 07:06.124
and getting chewed on
by wild animals?

shatter the bonds of trust

07:13.066 --> 07:14.265
we share as friends.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.733
And I can't let that happen.

April Fools' Day is over.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.138

07:20.140 --> 07:22.240
But we haven't even
pranked you yet.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.008

Oh! Oh, it is the crime alert.

07:34.487 --> 07:38.156
Indeed. A huge, um,
booger monster...

-(BOTH GIGGLING)

07:41.061 --> 07:43.361
Really? A booger monster?

07:43.363 --> 07:46.264
(GIGGLING) It seems
his power is boogers.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.733
Wow. This is the best
you guys could come up with?

07:48.735 --> 07:50.301
This is no prank, Mama.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.603
I don't know if we will be
able to defeat this villain

07:52.605 --> 07:55.373
if we do not have
your support.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.674
You'll be fine.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.644
Then we have no choice.

Ah!

08:39.018 --> 08:40.651
The booger monster was real?

08:40.653 --> 08:43.755
Yes, and we could not
defeat him.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.890
He destroyed our beloved city.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.626
Cyborg is in a robot coma!

08:48.628 --> 08:51.863
I told you there was
nothing funny about
April Fools pranks.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.632
No good can come from
being cruel to your friends.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.567
We've learned
our lesson, Mama.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.336
No more pranks or lies.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.004
Just the real reals.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.673
Then be real, Beast Boy.

This is me getting as
reals as I can.

I love you, too.

If Cyborg's robot coma has
taught me anything,

09:11.518 --> 09:13.985
it's that some chances
are worth taking.

will you marry me?

-Yes.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.036
These expressions of
love and truth

09:32.038 --> 09:34.038
saved me from my robot coma.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.407
I know how precious
life is now.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.276
That's why I'm
leaving the Titans

09:38.278 --> 09:41.145

in the Justice League.

the day we all leave
childish things behind.
