00:03.521 --> 00:05.788
- Good mornin'!
- Good morning.

00:05.790 --> 00:07.322
- Oh, man, damn, Brown,

00:07.324 --> 00:10.526
will you please turn
that shirt down, man?

00:10.528 --> 00:13.929
Look like a rainbow
threw up on you!

00:13.931 --> 00:17.232
- What--I have you to know
this is called hot cooter.

00:17.234 --> 00:20.402
- Did he say "hot cooter"?
- Yeah, everybody know that

00:20.404 --> 00:23.405
high-end fashion is called
hot cooter.

- Anyway, whatever it is,
it's a gift to me from me.

00:31.415 --> 00:34.149
Yeah, I finally broke
even here at Pleasant Days.

00:34.151 --> 00:36.118
Yeah, I am
officially recouped.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.788
My $40,000 is back in my pocket.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.225
- Don't go spending all your
money on yourself, Mr. Brown.

00:43.227 --> 00:45.160
You have maintenance
issues here to deal with.

00:45.162 --> 00:46.895
- Say what?

00:46.897 --> 00:49.098
- Efe's toilet is clogged.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.567
- Well--well, get a plunger!

00:51.569 --> 00:55.037
- Plunger? I pay money.
You better fix it.

00:55.039 --> 00:56.872
- Reginald's faucet drips.

00:56.874 --> 00:59.575
- Well, buy him some headphones.
He won't hear it.

00:59.577 --> 01:01.610
- I paid here
six months in advance

01:01.612 --> 01:03.712
and you will complete
the repair.

01:03.714 --> 01:06.348
- And every time I
open my shower curtain,

01:06.350 --> 01:09.518
the rod falls and
almost hits me in my eye.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.522
- That's why the Lord gave you
two eyes, in case one go out!

01:13.524 --> 01:15.958
Okay, look, I need
everybody to be patient,

01:15.960 --> 01:20.295
'cuz if everything works out
according to plan, I'ma be rich!

01:20.297 --> 01:21.630
And I'll fix
everything for y'all.

01:21.632 --> 01:23.532
- And how do you
plan to get rich?

01:23.534 --> 01:25.968
Sell your organs
on the black market?

01:25.970 --> 01:30.105
- Hm, the shape his body in,
he should try the flea market.

01:30.107 --> 01:31.507
- Just in case y'all
haven't noticed,

01:31.509 --> 01:33.976
there's a brand-new
five-star luxury hotel

01:33.978 --> 01:35.577
opening up across the street.

01:35.579 --> 01:37.513
- Well, how the hell that's
gonna help Pleasant Days?

01:37.515 --> 01:39.148
- Okay, it's kind of like

01:39.150 --> 01:40.716
when people see me and you
together in public.

01:40.718 --> 01:43.585
They automatically
think you got class.

01:43.587 --> 01:46.288
We can jack the price up
on all the residents.

01:46.290 --> 01:48.957
- You do know you're
talking to your residents.

01:48.959 --> 01:52.060
- We can jack the price up
on all the new residents

01:52.062 --> 01:53.562
when they come pouring in,

01:53.564 --> 01:56.765
as soon as the inspector
give us our recommendation.

01:56.767 --> 01:59.434
- And what makes you think
you're gonna be put on the list?

01:59.436 --> 02:01.570
- Well, 'cuz when the inspector
interviews y'all today,

02:01.572 --> 02:04.907
y'all can tell him what a
great place this is to live.

02:04.909 --> 02:07.509
- And why on earth would we do
that when you haven't addressed

02:07.511 --> 02:09.144
these repairs that are needed?

02:09.146 --> 02:10.779
- Okay, listen up.

02:10.781 --> 02:12.748
I'm gonna get to it, I just
can't get to it right now.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.584
But I promise, just
trust me, I'ma get it done.

02:15.586 --> 02:19.121
- We'd trust you more
if you give us $100.

02:19.123 --> 02:22.257
- No problem.
- Each.

02:22.259 --> 02:24.159
- Yeah, that's a problem.

02:24.161 --> 02:27.896
Okay, what I can do is I can
give y'all $20 each and some

02:27.898 --> 02:31.700
Pop-Oh's coupons for
a two-piece chicken.

02:31.702 --> 02:33.001
- Pop-Oh's coupon?

02:33.003 --> 02:34.570
You'd be a damn fool
not to take 'em.

Them things like gold
on the street, man.

residents.

- [chuckles]
- Coupon.

02:48.552 --> 02:49.852
Coupon?

02:56.827 --> 02:58.460
- That's all I got, ma'am!

03:01.632 --> 03:05.100
- When you say you will
fix everything around here,

03:05.102 --> 03:07.836
does that include getting
rid of that obscene shirt?

03:07.838 --> 03:09.071

I was distracted by
the muscular deliverymen

03:40.721 --> 03:44.690
across the street
putting on a show.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.925
Boy, I've spotted
every bit of opulence,

from a grand piano to
crystal chandeliers.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.033
I mean, that hotel is

wonderful, but, uh,

I believe the inspector's
getting a little antsy.

keep you waiting.

Mea culpa.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.681
I seem to be missing
an Efe and a Vincent.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.718
Is that correct?
- Oh, um, Vinny is napping

04:12.720 --> 04:17.089
and Efe is in Reginald's room
using the toilet.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.858
- That incorrigible sneak!

04:19.860 --> 04:23.095
- Why is Mr. Efe using
Reginald's toilet?

04:23.097 --> 04:26.732
- Uh, uh...oh, because, um,

04:26.734 --> 04:29.501
Reginald has very
interesting literature

04:29.503 --> 04:33.271
that he keeps by his commode.
Why else?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.641

can't wait any longer, okay?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.275
I'll get started with you two.

down, we'll finish with them.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.346
Shall we begin?

04:41.348 --> 04:43.582
- By all means.
- Excellent.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.350
Now, you all know I'm here

04:45.352 --> 04:48.520
to get a sense of how well
Pleasant Days is treating you

04:48.522 --> 04:50.822
in order to determine if
the facility is worthy of

04:50.824 --> 04:53.492
being placed on
the county recommend list.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.127
- Well, I fell
in love with the place

04:55.129 --> 04:59.064
the moment I stepped
my red bottoms inside.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.466
- Yes, but an assisted
living facility is like

05:01.468 --> 05:03.135
any relationship.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.804
When you first move in, the
owner's on his best behavior.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.240
But after the honeymoon stage,
the true colors come out!

05:10.511 --> 05:12.678
- My second husband
showed me his true colors

05:12.680 --> 05:14.146
on the night of our honeymoon,

05:14.148 --> 05:18.216
when he revealed his
pink-and-purple panty!

05:18.218 --> 05:20.152
- TMI.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.787
- Well, I guess
I'll let you go ahead

05:21.789 --> 05:23.689
and interview Reginald first.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.891
I'll go and get a head
start on waking up Vinny.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.828
He sleeps like a
tranquilizer victim.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.963
- [sighs]
Well, that was fun.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.132
Okay, Mr. Junie.
Shall we begin?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.902
- Whoo! Sorry I'm late.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.604
Ooh, the drive over
here took forever!

05:39.606 --> 05:41.273
- Bad traffic?

05:41.275 --> 05:44.376
- No, no, it was hard pressing
the gas pedal with my brand-new,

05:44.378 --> 05:47.245
state-of-the-art roller skate.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.414
- Why didn't you take the
skates off before you started--

05:49.416 --> 05:51.817
oh, never mind.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.752
- So, what did I miss?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.687
You didn't forget
our deal, did you?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.623
- Deal? What deal?

05:58.625 --> 06:01.026
- Yeah, I didn't
say--I said meal!

06:01.028 --> 06:03.929
Yes. Uh, uh,
to show our appreciation

06:03.931 --> 06:07.199
for you putting us on the
county, uh, recommendation list,

06:07.201 --> 06:10.736
we, uh, are gonna make you
a meal. Yes.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.070
- Save your sandwich, Mr. Brown.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.839
Let's not get ahead of
ourselves.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.041
My recommendation is
gonna be determined by

06:16.043 --> 06:17.943
what the residents have to say.

06:17.945 --> 06:21.813
- Oh, well, they're not--
they're not very talkative.

06:21.815 --> 06:25.183
No, they don't say much.
Mu--mute even, there you go.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.752
- That's okay.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.487
All I ask is that everyone
answer my questions

06:28.489 --> 06:29.988
honestly and truthfully,

06:29.990 --> 06:32.424
as if under
oath in a court of law.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.927
- Sorry, Mr. Brown, I just
don't feel comfortable.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.296
- And why don't you feel
comfortable, Reginald?

06:38.298 --> 06:40.699
- 'Cuz his drawers are tight!

06:40.701 --> 06:43.468
Some--sometime they just
suck up on him like that.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.070
- Mr. Brown, please.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.105
Mr. Junie here
has something to say

06:47.107 --> 06:48.673
he doesn't feel
comfortable about,

06:48.675 --> 06:50.175
and I need
to hear what it is.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.078
- Well, what--what he doesn't
feel comfortable about is

06:53.080 --> 06:56.148
the brand-new chess set
that I just bought him.

06:56.150 --> 06:59.618
He don't feel comfortable
taking good gifts like that.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.221
But I insist on the chess
set that I'm about--

07:03.223 --> 07:04.422
Ooh, the chess set--

07:04.424 --> 07:07.425
- Oh, yes, that--
- Remember?

07:07.427 --> 07:12.564
- --that very high-quality,
expensive chess set

07:12.566 --> 07:15.801
with the hand-carved pieces of
the, uh,

07:15.803 --> 07:18.937
heroes of Black
American history.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.173
Isn't that right, Mr. Brown?

07:21.175 --> 07:25.043
- Yeah, Black history
chess set with carved.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.679
- Mr. Brown, I like
what I see so far.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.214
I really like your chances

07:29.216 --> 07:31.349
of landing on that
county recommend list.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.688
- [inaudible whispering]

07:36.690 --> 07:38.990
- Reginald's faucet
is still leaking.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.060
The curtain rod almost
hit Anastasia in her eye.

07:42.062 --> 07:46.298
And my toilet, it's
still constipated.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.733
- I know, Efe.
Look, I wanna fix everything.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.035
I really do, all right?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.336
But Mr. Brown
didn't give me the money

07:51.338 --> 07:52.804
to go to the hardware store.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.174
- So--so--so--well, where
is that cheap bastard? Hm?

07:56.176 --> 07:59.211
- I'm ridin' and I'm rollin'.
Ridin' and I'm rollin'.

07:59.213 --> 08:02.614
I'm ridin' on these rims,

08:02.616 --> 08:05.450
Ridin', ridin'. [laughs]

08:05.452 --> 08:09.654
- Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown!
- Huh?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.456
- You spent the repair
money on this thing?

08:11.458 --> 08:12.924
- Oh, relax, boy!

08:12.926 --> 08:15.961
Look, the inspector
already put us on the list.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.229

08:19.533 --> 08:21.399

in a river of something else

08:24.371 --> 08:26.004
unless you fix my toilet!

08:27.374 --> 08:30.108
Mr. Brown, you better
keep up to your promises.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.943
- Or what? You're gonna
take all your stuff

08:31.945 --> 08:34.779
and drag it 50 miles to the
nearest assisted living center

08:34.781 --> 08:37.349
that we both know
ain't better than this?

08:37.351 --> 08:40.585
I don't think so.
Get out of my face, I'm ridin'.

nice, I thought it was!

- I'm proud of you, Mr. Brown.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.227
- Well, join--join the club.
Get in line.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.597
Hey, it ain't everybody that
can ride around here 27 to 37

09:59.599 --> 10:04.069
to 47 times without stopping.
Yeah, my mama would be proud.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.371
- No, man. I'm proud of you
for doing the right thing

10:06.373 --> 10:09.007
and buying that big screen TV
for our residents.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.709
It just got delivered.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.278
- What? Dang,
I keep forgetting to

10:13.280 --> 10:16.081
change my Monzon address
to my house.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.952
- Wait, you bought that
TV for your own house?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.988
- Yeah, how else am I
gonna watch the stories?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.757
Stay with me, son, stay with me!

10:25.759 --> 10:27.926
- Look, I hate to tell you
how to run the business, okay?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.394
But you need
to take this thing back

10:29.396 --> 10:31.262
and get the money back
for the repairs.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.165
Our residents pay good money to
be here and they deserve better.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.668
- Well, what about
what I deserve?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.636
What about me?

10:38.638 --> 10:42.207
You know, I worked hard all my
life just to try to get a little

10:42.209 --> 10:44.476
piece of the pie and come up.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.979
And now you wanna try to
keep a big dog from eating.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.015
- Come on, Brown, you
know it ain't like that.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.317
If you don't fulfill your
obligations to our residents,

10:52.319 --> 10:55.286
you gonna roll
right off that hill.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.856
- What, you think they gonna
move across the street?

10:57.858 --> 11:02.494
- Hmm, live band,
fancy finger foods,

11:02.496 --> 11:04.496
and toilets that work.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.832
No, why would they do that?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.401
- Aw, I ain't
worried about them.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.503
That--that ain't nothing but
a bunch of bells and whistles.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.104
Ain't nobody worried. I ain't
worried about them.

11:15.659 --> 11:19.661
- [humming] Ahhh!

11:19.663 --> 11:24.065
Pleasurable Years
Assisted Living is amazing!

11:24.067 --> 11:26.534
The residence has
its own sports bar.

11:26.536 --> 11:30.905
I just rooted for my country's
football team to victory.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.508
We won! We won!

11:33.510 --> 11:38.747
[laughs] We won!

11:38.749 --> 11:41.116
- No, he lyin'.
He probably drunk.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.584
- Why would you think that?

11:42.586 --> 11:44.352
- You heard what he said?
- [doorbell rings]

11:44.354 --> 11:47.222
- He said, I root for my
country's football team.

11:47.224 --> 11:50.725
Everybody know Africa
ain't got no football.

11:50.727 --> 11:55.029
- Mr. Brown, football is soccer
everywhere else in the world

11:55.031 --> 11:59.033
besides America, okay?
Clearly, he had a good time!

11:59.035 --> 12:00.635
- I know Anastasia
don't even like sports,

12:00.637 --> 12:02.570
so she probably
ain't have a good time.

12:02.572 --> 12:06.408
- Pleasurable Years
is simply divine.

12:06.410 --> 12:09.344
The residents
have their own spa.

12:09.346 --> 12:12.947
And a handsome Swede
named Sven Magnusson

12:12.949 --> 12:15.683
gave me a foot massage today.

12:15.685 --> 12:20.822
And his firm hands etched
his name into my soles.

12:20.824 --> 12:24.626
And my soul--honey, now I know

12:24.628 --> 12:27.028
why it's called Pleasurable.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.465
- I'm not even gonna
stress 'cuz I know Reggie--

12:30.467 --> 12:32.734
he don't like people touching
all on his feet and stuff,

12:32.736 --> 12:34.636
so he probably just--he
probably a little bit mad--

12:34.638 --> 12:39.140
- [laughs] They even
have a library that rivals

12:39.142 --> 12:42.710
the one in ancient Alexandria!

12:42.712 --> 12:45.180
[laughs]

12:48.051 --> 12:49.918
- Vinny! You the co-owner.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.519
You ain't supposed
to be over there!

12:51.521 --> 12:55.890
- I know, but man, they got an
Olympic-sized swimming pool.

12:55.892 --> 12:57.525
Man! [laughs]

12:57.527 --> 12:59.627
- You told me you don't get in
the pool 'cuz chlorine seeps

12:59.629 --> 13:02.797
into your skin and make
your internal organs ashy.

13:02.799 --> 13:05.800
- I don't swim, but that pool
over there is everything.

13:05.802 --> 13:07.802
And the women are fine.

13:07.804 --> 13:09.437
That place is lit, man!

13:12.976 --> 13:14.776
- You worried now?

13:14.778 --> 13:20.648
- No. Leroy F. Brown.
The F is for Favored by God.

13:20.650 --> 13:24.219
- As long as you're confident.
- I'm good.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.356
I'm good--I'm good.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.461
Lord, please don't
let them leave us!

13:33.463 --> 13:36.297
I'ma be poor and broke
and just livin' in a box

13:36.299 --> 13:38.833
or something, Lord! Please--
- What is wrong with you?

13:38.835 --> 13:40.401
Pull yourself
together, Mr. Brown!

13:40.403 --> 13:42.070
- We can't compete!
I'm gonna be broke.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.671
We gon' lose everything!

13:43.673 --> 13:45.406
- Man, that place ain't
that much better than ours.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.108
They just got a
few more amenities.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.510
That's it.

13:48.512 --> 13:51.813
- You mean they got
a whale over there?

13:51.815 --> 13:53.081
- Mr. Brown?
- Huh?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.950
- That's a manatee.
I said amenity.

13:55.952 --> 13:59.420
- Men-tee-keys. Meni...
What?

13:59.422 --> 14:01.089
- They got more
perks than us, okay?

14:01.091 --> 14:02.457
Now, if you get some
perks around here,

14:02.459 --> 14:04.659
then maybe your residents
would wanna stay.

14:04.661 --> 14:07.128
- Well, why didn't you
just say get perks?

14:07.130 --> 14:08.530
Why do you gotta try
to go all difficult

14:08.532 --> 14:10.899
and use big words like
amanatays?

14:10.901 --> 14:12.567
You done should've said perks!

14:12.569 --> 14:14.035
That's all you
should've said, perks.

14:14.037 --> 14:15.436
You just gotta make
stuff difficult.

14:17.707 --> 14:19.240
[clears throat]

14:19.242 --> 14:21.476
Welcome to the grand reopening
of Pleasant Days,

14:21.478 --> 14:24.812
where we now have
luxuries for everyone.

14:24.814 --> 14:29.751
- The only luxury I want is
a faucet that doesn't drip.

14:29.753 --> 14:33.888
The incessant drip, drip,
drip, drip is, like...

14:33.890 --> 14:37.792
haunting my dreams, like
Poe's "Telltale Heart."

14:37.794 --> 14:40.495
- I don't know what that
mean, but I--I'm confused,

14:40.497 --> 14:44.532
'cuz I had Jeremy to--to
fix everything on that list!

14:44.534 --> 14:47.402
- He removed the entire faucet.

14:47.404 --> 14:49.938
- Well, then it ain't
dripping no more, is it?

14:49.940 --> 14:51.339
- My bad, Judge. Look,

14:51.341 --> 14:53.074
I was planning on
replacing it after I removed it,

14:53.076 --> 14:55.276
but Mr. Brown didn't
buy a new one.

14:55.278 --> 14:57.211
- What about
Anastasia's shower rod?

14:57.213 --> 14:59.447
You pieced it together
with duct tape.

14:59.449 --> 15:02.717
- And voila! No more duckin'!

15:02.719 --> 15:06.254
- And Efe's toilet.
Still clogged.

15:06.256 --> 15:07.722
Now, how do you explain that?

15:07.724 --> 15:09.357
- Okay, now that's on him.

15:09.359 --> 15:11.159
He got to get something to
start breaking this stuff down.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.694
That fufu is clogging
up the toilets.

15:12.696 --> 15:16.497
That ain't me, that's him. You
ain't about to put that on me.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.733
- So, clearly you had
no intention of fixing

15:18.735 --> 15:20.335
our maintenance issues.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.703
Now--[clears throat]

15:21.705 --> 15:24.505
--what about the chess set
you promised me?

15:24.507 --> 15:27.442
- Oh, right there, bam.
Look at that.

15:27.444 --> 15:29.010
I got it--I got it fixed all up.

15:29.012 --> 15:32.180
Bam, look at that. And bam!

15:32.182 --> 15:36.117
- A fruity cereal box
with rocks on it?

15:36.119 --> 15:37.418
- Yeah.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.320
- Why did you put
"MLK" on this one?

15:39.322 --> 15:41.322
- Oh, that's the king.

15:41.324 --> 15:44.659
The one with "Beyoncé,"
that--that's the queen.

15:44.661 --> 15:49.130
- And why does
this one say "Mr. Ed"?

15:49.132 --> 15:50.865
- The horsey!

15:50.867 --> 15:53.935
- This is ridiculous.
We misled the inspector

15:53.937 --> 15:57.338
and you didn't hold up
your end of the bargain.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.474
- Okay, look, now, I was too
busy trying to get all them

15:59.476 --> 16:02.210
amenit--jamenities--
[stutters]

16:02.212 --> 16:04.545
- Amenities! Amenities!

16:04.547 --> 16:08.282
- Oh, I tell you, I did do it!
I got Efe his big screen TV.

16:08.284 --> 16:10.284
- No, I saw that.
That wasn't a big screen.

16:10.286 --> 16:13.621
That was two small
TVs pushed together.

16:13.623 --> 16:16.324
- That's picture in picture!

16:16.326 --> 16:19.327
And--and see?
Reg, I got you your chess set.

16:19.329 --> 16:20.862
- [groans]

16:20.864 --> 16:22.397
- You're too ungrateful
to even appreciate it.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.433
Sorry for your loss!

16:25.435 --> 16:27.902
You just unappreciative and
you don't appreciate stuff.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.303
- REGINALD: This is ridiculous.

16:29.305 --> 16:31.973
- I set Anastasia up
with her own private spa!

16:31.975 --> 16:33.608
- Uh, uh, see, I saw that, too.

16:33.610 --> 16:35.543
Now, I understand
the lawn chair.

16:35.545 --> 16:37.111
And I understand the choir robe.

16:37.113 --> 16:39.614
But what is the--
the water hose for?

16:39.616 --> 16:42.350
- Okay, she wanted
to make a mud mask. Put little--

16:42.352 --> 16:45.953
- The nerve!
- Okay, look, I'm sorry.

16:45.955 --> 16:48.723
I just wanted to give all y'all
something that y'all deserve!

16:48.725 --> 16:51.826
I wanted to do right,
but I--I ran out of money.

16:51.828 --> 16:54.395
- Because you spent
it all on yourself.

16:54.397 --> 16:56.064
- That's it!

16:56.066 --> 16:58.933
I am tired of being treated
like vegans in a rib joint!

16:58.935 --> 17:00.568
We're all moving out!

17:00.570 --> 17:02.403
- Where you think you going?

17:02.405 --> 17:04.439
You can't afford that place
where all the residents have

17:04.441 --> 17:06.774
their personal butler.
- No, he got a point.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.177
- They're offering
a move-in special.

17:09.179 --> 17:11.479
The first six months free.

17:14.484 --> 17:17.585
- Well,
I--I give you a month free.

17:19.389 --> 17:20.988
I can't compete with that.

17:20.990 --> 17:23.558
- ♪

17:23.560 --> 17:26.360
- What's all these bags?
Where you going?

17:26.362 --> 17:28.830
- We're moving out
like we said we would.

17:28.832 --> 17:31.666
- But I put all my--my new swag
on tBay so Jeremy could fix

17:31.668 --> 17:36.571
the stuff for real this time.
- We know.

17:36.573 --> 17:40.274
- Well, I done everything.
What more do y'all want from me?

17:40.276 --> 17:44.145
- Something that doesn't
cost a penny, Mr. Brown.

17:44.147 --> 17:47.815
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.518
- R-P...R-P-S.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.686
Okay, you lost me with the R.

17:51.688 --> 17:53.654
You're gonna have
to just tell me.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.425
- Respect!
- That's what I was thinking.

17:57.427 --> 18:00.161
But--but I do appreciate y'all.
And I respect y'all.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.029
Not--not just 'cuz
y'all give me money.

18:02.031 --> 18:03.831
I really do.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.199
- I'm listening.

18:05.201 --> 18:07.301
- And--and I appreciate it

18:07.303 --> 18:10.138
when Reginald tried to
teach me big words, too.

18:10.140 --> 18:12.707
- For the record, you
teach him some words, too.

18:12.709 --> 18:14.342
- But I--I enjoy
all your stories.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.910
They fun. I like 'em.

18:15.912 --> 18:17.612
- You do?
- Yes!

18:17.614 --> 18:20.114
- Did I ever tell you the story
about when I was on the set of

18:20.116 --> 18:24.018
"Attack of the Mutant Pimps"
with Scatman Crothers and--

18:24.020 --> 18:26.521
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you told
us a whole bunch of times.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.190
And you--[stammers]
Yes, yes.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.693
- Well, I'm sure I probably did
tell you once or twice already.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.962
- Or three or four.
- But you know what?

18:34.964 --> 18:37.532
That's what it is when
you're in a relationship,

18:37.534 --> 18:39.667
when you live together.

18:39.669 --> 18:43.304
Pleasant Days is like
the boy you grew up with.

18:43.306 --> 18:44.906
- Yeah?

18:44.908 --> 18:46.507
- The boy across the street
might have more hair than

18:46.509 --> 18:47.975
Pleasant Days--

18:47.977 --> 18:51.078
- Are you trying to
say y'all gonna stay?

18:51.080 --> 18:56.784
- Well, what I'm trying to say
is that the most important thing

18:56.786 --> 18:59.487
is the history that we share.
That's what I'm trying to say.

18:59.489 --> 19:02.990
- Oh, so y'all not gonna stay.

19:02.992 --> 19:05.493
Are y'all gonna stay
or--or y'all gonna go?

19:05.495 --> 19:06.527
- We're gonna stay.

19:06.529 --> 19:09.330
- Yes! Yes, Lord! Yes!

19:09.332 --> 19:11.465
Y'all gonna stay!
God is good all the time.

19:11.467 --> 19:14.302
Let me help you with
these bags and move--

19:14.304 --> 19:17.572
Wait a minute, that's it?
That's it?

19:17.574 --> 19:20.474
All these bags empty!

19:20.476 --> 19:22.877
Y'all was just trying to
make me sweat, wasn't you?

19:22.879 --> 19:26.747
That's cold.
That's just cold-bleeded.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.984
- We never really
wanted a divorce, Brown.

19:29.986 --> 19:32.420
We love it here.
- Oh.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.455
- But before we
make this official,

19:34.457 --> 19:36.524
I do have one condition.

19:36.526 --> 19:38.893
- You not gonna try to
do love to me, are you?

19:38.895 --> 19:42.096
- Mr. Brown!
- Oh, ooh, you scared me!

19:42.098 --> 19:44.298
I thought she was gonna try
to throw me down and try to be

19:44.300 --> 19:45.566
