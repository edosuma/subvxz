WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:09.565
Love is overrated,

00:09.600 --> 00:11.685
and built on very shaky ground,

00:11.720 --> 00:14.320
whereas an affair with a wardrobe...

00:14.355 --> 00:16.920
it's solid and it lasts forever.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.640
That's Â£4,600, please.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.280
I'll pay cash.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.840
No. 1 unwritten rule of being an escort.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.880
You're only allowed one lover.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.760
Money.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.980
That one's quite good.

01:20.015 --> 01:22.007
Do you think?

01:22.042 --> 01:23.965
You don't like it?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.280
I just... think it looks a bit cheap.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.245
Unless that's what you're after.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.120
No, no. We, er... we don't want cheap.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.600
And it's important that
you're happy with it.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.160
Um... this one is a bit subtler.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.285
Yeah, maybe.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.300
Well... would you buy it?

01:55.335 --> 01:57.280
Well, I don't have to, do I?

01:58.960 --> 02:01.205
You're angry with me.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.500
No, it's just that... we're acting
as though nothing happened and,

02:03.501 --> 02:06.560
frankly, I just find that a bit odd.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.600
I, er... I think we should,
maybe keep it at work,

02:12.635 --> 02:14.520
in the work place.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.720
Absolutely.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.445
- Belle.
- Yeah.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.725
- We...
- We had sex... here,

02:22.760 --> 02:25.005
which is very much in the workplace,

02:25.040 --> 02:29.040
or on the workplace, if you want to count
the desk. There you go, I've said it.

02:29.075 --> 02:31.405
Ok. Is that better now?

02:31.440 --> 02:34.405
Yeah, it is, but I should probably leave

02:34.440 --> 02:37.160
and come back and do the
writer stuff another time.

02:37.195 --> 02:39.240
Ok that's fine. You go.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.840
Great. Thanks.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.120
I don't need a boyfriend,
when I've got regulars like Al.

02:57.155 --> 03:00.560
He pays well, and there's
no bullshit. No games.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.120
Hi, beautiful. How you doing? All right?

03:09.155 --> 03:10.485
Good. You?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.400
Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, great!

03:13.120 --> 03:16.000
I missed you. So, what
do you fancy doing today?

03:16.035 --> 03:18.157
- What are you in the mood for?
- Anything.

03:18.192 --> 03:20.280
- Everything. I'll let you decide.
- Perfect.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.165
Can we do it on the floor again?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.720
I love all that. Makes
me feel all young again.

03:25.755 --> 03:27.817
- You are young, silly.
- Ah, stop it!

03:27.852 --> 03:29.880
- Say it again, a bit slower.
- You are...

03:31.760 --> 03:35.160
All right, then. I'm gonna
go take a little shower.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.685
See? Easy.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.360
Sex, enthusiasm, respect, clarity.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.885
Yeah, that's it. Just there.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.000
- Is that all right?
- Oh, no, no, that's good.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.160
That's better than good.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.760
All right, just... a tiny bit faster.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.600
No, a bit slower.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.320
All right, faster now.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.085
No! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:14.120 --> 04:16.360
That was close. Bloody lovely, though.

04:16.394 --> 04:18.605
All right, come on. Your turn.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.880
I want to get the speed just right,
this time... and the pressure.

04:21.915 --> 04:23.845
Sounds like pumping up a car tyre.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.760
Well don't talk about cars,
you'll get me too excited.

04:26.795 --> 04:28.480
- Have you done it?
- Yeah.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.040
Oh, now that is a beautiful sight.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.640
Ah, look at you.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.180
- Oh, well. It's only the cheap stuff.
- It's not cheap.

04:40.215 --> 04:42.800
No, it's not classy, is
it? Come on, up you get.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.880
Is this your idea of classy, is it?

04:45.915 --> 04:48.005
You watch it, you.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.040
I'm in quite a strategic position, here.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.440
- Are you all right up there?
- What do you think?

04:55.680 --> 04:57.560
Three sugars?

04:58.400 --> 05:00.280
Yeah, magic.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.165
That's for you.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.960
- What is it? A tip?
- Cheeky.

05:08.440 --> 05:12.205
No, it's a, er... it's a retainer.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.845
I'm thinking I might have
a bit more time to play with

05:14.880 --> 05:18.280
on this next contract, so I
might make it round every Tuesday.

05:18.315 --> 05:21.240
- You all right with that?
- Perfect. How much is in there?

05:21.275 --> 05:23.365
Ten hours.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.080
Look, I did round it up, though,
so if you want to give me a freebie,

05:27.115 --> 05:29.525
it would be appreciated,
thank you very much.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.300
- I'll throw in a few blowjobs.
- Great. We're going steady, aren't we?

05:32.301 --> 05:34.240
You and me. Happy days.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.205
Do you never...

05:40.240 --> 05:42.320
Have you never fancied settling down?

05:42.355 --> 05:44.445
You know, with a fella.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.205
I can't have a boyfriend. Not while
I'm doing this job. It's impossible.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.480
Get out of it. You could have any bloke you wanted, like that.
- They can't handle it.

05:52.515 --> 05:55.200
No? I guess it all depends
on the fella, doesn't it?

05:56.640 --> 05:58.720
Well, could you handle it?

05:58.755 --> 06:00.520
- Truthfully?
- Yeah.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.320
All right, look. If I
met you and I was single

06:05.355 --> 06:07.160
and... and you told me what you did...

06:08.000 --> 06:11.480
Yeah. Yeah, I could definitely
handle it. Course I could. Yeah.

06:11.515 --> 06:14.405
But we'd have to be completely
straight with each other.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.320
Right. And this is coming from a man
who can't tell his wife he takes sugar.

06:18.355 --> 06:20.200
You cheeky mare!

06:21.440 --> 06:23.400
All right. I should go.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.160
- Bye, hun.
- Bye, sweetheart.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.680
- Duncan, hi.
- Hi.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.640
Can I come in?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.640
Yeah.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.600
Shit! Shit! Bollocks!

07:41.840 --> 07:43.680
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.240
I've... um. I just brought
you these for your approval.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.240
- Thanks.
- We narrowed it down to four.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.520
Great. This is unexpected.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.760
Yeah, sorry. I should
probably have rung ahead first.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.400
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.760
I thought the, er, cuts
you made were great.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.040
- Really work.
- Good.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.520
Look, I know I was a
bit... rubbish earlier on.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.800
I'm not very good at all
of that sort of thing.

08:30.835 --> 08:32.284
It's ok.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.600
Do you think we could, sort of... rewind?

08:34.960 --> 08:36.840
Forget I was a bit of a twat?

08:37.480 --> 08:39.320
- Course we can.
- Thanks.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.920
You're actually meant to say, "Oh
no, you weren't a bit of a twat."

08:44.955 --> 08:46.805
Oh.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.880
And that's your second chance.

08:48.915 --> 08:50.760
And it's gone.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.120
Look, I really like you.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.840
I'd like to see you again.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
But I have to warn you, I'm...
a complete and utter nightmare.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.920
Is this supposed to be some challenge?

09:08.760 --> 09:10.640
No.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.120
Yeah, maybe.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.920
What do you think?

09:19.120 --> 09:24.320
I think it's only fair
that I should warn you...

09:24.355 --> 09:26.680
I'm impossible too.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.045
- Really.
- Really.

09:30.080 --> 09:35.480
I mean, for starters, I'm
completely OCD about cleanliness.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.680
Hm.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.920
Oh, you're lying.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.965
Fuck off.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.880
I'm joking. It's immaculate!

09:48.640 --> 09:51.000
- And hoovered.
- Hoovered?

09:53.320 --> 09:55.680
Well, I'm gonna have to inspect that.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.800
- Oh, shit. What was that?
- No, it's empty. Sorry.

10:05.835 --> 10:07.765
- It's fine.
- No, no, no. It's not.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.000
It's ok. Everyone should
drink champagne in the morning.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.005
What?

10:14.040 --> 10:16.880
Just so long as there's
no-one hiding in the bedroom.

10:16.915 --> 10:18.800
No, nobody.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.005
This is not right.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.240
What? Al? No, no, no. You've got to go.

10:25.275 --> 10:27.120
How come he doesn't mind?

10:28.760 --> 10:32.600
Just like you said, if you want to be
with someone, you want to be with him.

10:32.635 --> 10:36.280
I was lying. No man can be ok
with his woman doing what you do.

10:36.315 --> 10:39.560
It's a no-go area. No ifs or buts.

10:39.595 --> 10:42.325
You are so lovely.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.200
Ha! I bet he says that to all the girls.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.440
- Do you want me to get him off you?
- No!

10:47.475 --> 10:49.480
Ask him why it's not a problem.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Go on.

10:53.035 --> 10:55.000
Duncan.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.680
I'm... a prostitute.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.845
I'm... an editor.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.160
Yeah... why are you ok with it?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.165
Well, it's just my job.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.080
No, no, no. It... um... it bothers
me that you're ok with what I do.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.240
Then... I'm not ok with it.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.800
Right, well, if that's the
case, it can't work, can it?

11:23.280 --> 11:26.160
You're not really giving
me much of a chance, here.

11:26.195 --> 11:28.040
I've got to be somewhere.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.845
Weren't we just...

11:31.880 --> 11:33.925
cos you seemed to be quite... into it.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.080
Yeah, I was, but now I'm
not and I need you to go now.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.080
Ok.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.040
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.485
What? I had to do it.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.520
He's my editor and escorts
can't have boyfriends. Keep up.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.000
When life gets too much,
this is my sanctuary.

12:18.035 --> 12:21.500
Anyone who says money
is the route of all evil

12:21.535 --> 12:23.380
has obviously never had a lot of it.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.500
Why would I go to a
bank, when there's this?

12:26.535 --> 12:29.060
London's best kept secret.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.265
Hi.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.840
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Doing your laundry too, are you?

12:56.875 --> 12:59.380
No need to look sheepish.
I'm not the taxman.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.700
I love spending time down here, don't you?

13:02.735 --> 13:04.825
Yeah. But I'm actually late.

13:04.860 --> 13:07.700
Do you know the thing I
like best about having cash?

13:07.735 --> 13:10.540
There's absolutely no-one
to spend it on but myself.

13:10.575 --> 13:12.420
Same for you too, isn't it?

13:13.780 --> 13:15.700
I've got to go.

13:21.820 --> 13:25.060
I just don't know whether I've
done the right thing or not.

13:25.620 --> 13:28.865
Ow! That helps, thanks!

13:28.900 --> 13:32.460
"I'm never gonna see someone
again, not while I'm doing this job.

13:32.495 --> 13:34.940
Punch me if I ever try
it." That's what you said.

13:34.975 --> 13:36.940
Maybe I was joking.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.860
Oh, my God. This is
the guy Bambi's seeing.

13:42.895 --> 13:44.700
- Guys, hi.
- Bambi.

13:44.735 --> 13:46.705
Hi. Byron.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.620
- Ben. Hannah.
- Hi. - Hello.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.460
We want your best champagne, Ben.

13:51.495 --> 13:54.357
Ooh! What's the occasion?

13:54.392 --> 13:57.220
Well... we're getting married.

13:57.255 --> 13:59.740
We are, yeah.

14:01.820 --> 14:04.020
Well, this is a bit, er...

14:04.055 --> 14:05.820
- Brilliant.
- Yeah.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.145
So, er... when did... did you...?

14:09.180 --> 14:12.100
First meet? Oh, er...
two weeks ago... today.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.540
Right. And you've set a date, have you?

14:15.575 --> 14:18.260
- Not yet.
- Yeah, it's up to Bambi, really.

14:18.295 --> 14:20.465
Mrs. Bambi.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.420
Might need to find out her
real name before the big day.

14:23.455 --> 14:25.825
You're being a bit weird about this.

14:25.860 --> 14:29.620
He booked you for a shag two weeks
ago. You hardly know each other..

14:29.655 --> 14:31.580
- Look, no offence, but...
- None taken.

14:31.615 --> 14:33.700
We'll get to know each other.

14:33.735 --> 14:35.580
Yeah. Everyday.

14:37.380 --> 14:42.380
Ok, well... what's her favourite colour?

14:43.540 --> 14:45.460
What?

14:46.660 --> 14:50.060
Just because it's a car crash
whenever you see someone,

14:50.095 --> 14:53.425
does not mean it has to be
the same for everyone else.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.840
Bam Bam, shall we go? I think
it might be an idea. Can we go?

14:56.875 --> 15:00.220
Yeah, course we can. We'll find
somewhere proper to celebrate.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.260
- What's her favourite colour?
- Shut up.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.700
That's you three up to date. Thank you.

15:34.260 --> 15:38.380
Ah, look who's here. Twice in
one day? Must be my birthday.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.345
- Do you have a minute?
- You paying?

15:40.380 --> 15:43.820
Right, bugger off. Work to do.

15:48.780 --> 15:50.665
What can I do for you?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.940
I'm a bit worried about Bambi.
She's been seeing this client.

15:53.975 --> 15:56.625
It doesn't worry me. As long
as she turns up for work.

15:56.660 --> 16:00.580
His name's Byron. He's asked her
to marry him. Do you know him?

16:00.615 --> 16:03.197
Yeah. Young guy. Old money.
He wants to marry her?

16:03.232 --> 16:05.780
Ooh. She's done all right
for herself, hasn't she?

16:05.815 --> 16:07.025
It's insane.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.220
Why? As long as she gets a good pre-nup.

16:09.255 --> 16:11.380
I'm talking about her wellbeing.

16:11.415 --> 16:13.260
So am I.

16:21.420 --> 16:23.500
Do you think it can ever work?

16:23.535 --> 16:25.580
Seeing someone and doing this job.

16:27.140 --> 16:28.625
No.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.785
I thought it could, once,

16:30.820 --> 16:32.980
then she ran off with
all my money and my car.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.945
Oh, right.

16:35.980 --> 16:38.660
Money's the only thing
worth having, Belle.

16:38.695 --> 16:41.340
Relationships. They're
unreliable, but this...

16:42.180 --> 16:44.100
You know that.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.540
We're alike, aren't we?

16:48.020 --> 16:49.980
Identical in some respects.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.744
Favourite pudding.

17:04.780 --> 17:07.540
Oh, er... treacle tart with custard.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.224
Um... tree.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.704
Tree? Favourite tree?

17:12.740 --> 17:17.099
Yes. Like mine's a... a sycamore.

17:17.135 --> 17:18.980
Er... sycamore, then.

17:19.819 --> 17:21.859
I like sycamores.

17:21.895 --> 17:23.625
Cartoon.

17:23.660 --> 17:27.140
Count Duckula closely followed
by Thundercats, obviously.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.905
Next question.

17:29.940 --> 17:34.968
Er... do you like... me?

17:34.969 --> 17:38.460
What? Of course I like you.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.460
Just wanted to check.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.340
A lot of people don't.

17:44.660 --> 17:47.380
My parents, for example.

17:48.780 --> 17:50.980
Mine didn't like me either.

17:51.015 --> 17:52.780
- No?
- No.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.585
Well, maybe they did,
but they gave me away,

17:55.620 --> 17:58.260
which probably means they
didn't like me that much.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.025
Superhero.

18:09.060 --> 18:12.780
Silver Surfer. Yours? And
it's not allowed to be me.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.260
Wolverine, definitely.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.140
Uh-huh.

18:19.175 --> 18:20.625
Hi.

18:20.660 --> 18:22.905
Belle, I'm in the middle of something.

18:22.940 --> 18:26.145
- Could you possibly wait outside?
- No, I can't. Can we, um...

18:26.180 --> 18:27.900
can we just stop playing grown-up
jobs and suits, for a minute,

18:27.901 --> 18:29.700
and actually talk about this?

18:31.215 --> 18:33.460
I'm gonna have to call
you back in ten minutes.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.860
Thanks.

18:37.020 --> 18:40.105
Look, I'm sorry if I was
confusing this morning,

18:40.140 --> 18:43.580
but... I've... never met a
man who can handle what I do

18:43.615 --> 18:46.460
and... I'm not sure you'll
be able to cope, so...

18:52.660 --> 18:55.220
Right. You know, that's
a bad idea. I'll just go.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.260
Belle, wait!

18:59.860 --> 19:02.100
Don't just walk away. Belle!

19:02.135 --> 19:04.020
My name's not Belle.

19:05.660 --> 19:09.305
- What is it, then? Tell me.
- No.

19:09.340 --> 19:12.140
- Where do you want this?
- Anywhere. Put it anywhere.

19:12.175 --> 19:13.460
Great.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.585
Anywhere but there.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.545
Why do you keep running away?

19:19.580 --> 19:21.745
She doesn't look anything like me.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.420
Look, if you're not
interested, that's fine.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.980
Before you came round today,
I'd had sex with another man.

19:31.340 --> 19:33.145
Yeah, I know that.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.385
Ok, say we meet after work,

19:35.420 --> 19:37.580
and you say, "How was your day, darling?"

19:37.615 --> 19:40.025
And I'm like, "Yeah, it was fine,

19:40.060 --> 19:44.420
I had sex with this guy. It
was nothing. How was yours?"

19:44.455 --> 19:47.900
Well, if I've been with
a guy, then I'll tell you.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.540
I've slept with 1,036 men.

19:56.180 --> 19:58.460
No, I can't top that.

19:58.495 --> 20:00.705
Sometimes I enjoy it.

20:00.740 --> 20:03.225
We're not talking about
a life sentence here,

20:03.260 --> 20:05.300
just... seeing where it goes.

20:05.301 --> 20:08.300
Yeah, but why would you want to see
me when there's all that baggage?

20:08.455 --> 20:11.060
Because I don't see baggage, or a problem.

20:12.220 --> 20:14.580
You're smart and funny.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.860
A bit crazy.

20:18.780 --> 20:21.700
Would you please tell me your real name?

20:25.620 --> 20:27.520
It's Hannah.

20:27.555 --> 20:29.420
Hannah. Nice.

20:32.900 --> 20:37.500
So we should stop analysing
ourselves into the ground, here.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.745
Ok.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.500
I like you, you like me. I fancy you...

20:43.900 --> 20:46.060
- I think you fancy me?
- I do.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.580
What are we arguing about, then?

20:51.740 --> 20:53.945
Nothing.

20:53.980 --> 20:55.860
So, we're on?

20:58.260 --> 21:00.180
Yeah, we're on.

21:04.020 --> 21:05.505
Call me James.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.700
If you're gonna do role play,
you have to do it completely.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.300
You have to get every detail right.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.940
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:13.660 --> 21:15.420
- What was that?
- He's a client.

21:16.420 --> 21:19.140
- This is Duncan. I've heard a lot about you.
- Right.

21:19.175 --> 21:20.185
- Evening.
- Evening.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.980
- Duncan is a prick.
- Oh, you wanker.

21:22.740 --> 21:23.740
This isn't over.
