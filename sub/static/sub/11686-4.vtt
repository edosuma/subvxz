WEBVTT

00:09.080 --> 00:12.004
Quite a plan you boys cooked up here.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.365
Quite a plan.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.931
I'm not sure what upsets me more,

00:18.400 --> 00:23.804
that I have four employees
that conspired to commit felony fraud,

00:23.880 --> 00:26.724
or that I have four employees
that are so stupid

00:26.800 --> 00:29.280
I found out about it within 30 seconds.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.810
Hearing it out loud, the first one seems worse.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.521
We got sales, manufacturing,
design, assembly,

00:37.640 --> 00:39.768
logistics teams, they're all ready to go.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.482
All of them on the payroll,
all of them here to build me a box.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.251
I have a deal, in principle,
with Maleant to buy the box.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.842
The second that we deliver a product
that meets those specs,

00:53.920 --> 00:55.649
we are cashing checks!

00:55.760 --> 00:59.890
And you are the only four people
in this building that are fighting me on it!

00:59.960 --> 01:03.726
So give me one reason
why I don't fire you right now,

01:03.800 --> 01:07.930
claw back your options,
make you unhireable all over town.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.844
One goddamn reason!

01:17.800 --> 01:18.961
Because you can't.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.806
Excuse me?

01:20.880 --> 01:23.850
This agreement says that you have 10 weeks

01:23.920 --> 01:26.844
to complete a working prototype
before the deal expires.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.766
So how are you gonna do that if you fire us?

01:30.120 --> 01:35.081
There are maybe eight engineers on Earth
proficient in middle-out compression.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.606
Five of them work for EndFrame,
your competition,

01:37.680 --> 01:40.160
and three of them are here
in this office right now.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.801
So if we're gone, I don't think
you're ever going to get your box.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.601
What do you want?

01:46.680 --> 01:49.081
I want to build my platform. Now.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.890
To complete the box project,
it's going to take six months at least.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.364
So, what I think maybe we should do is

01:57.240 --> 02:01.086
take a little tip from your chart there
and we compromise.

02:01.960 --> 02:06.887
Compromise is the shared hypotenuse
of the conjoined triangles of success.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.281
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.931
So, uh, what I'm proposing

02:11.880 --> 02:14.804
is we stand up the prototype, that's it.

02:14.880 --> 02:19.681
We're not doing any custom features,
no new versions, no maintenance, nothing.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.846
Richard, the Maleant basement.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.251
And no onsite support.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.767
I think you can hire other engineers
to do that fucking mole monkey work.

02:28.280 --> 02:33.684
The second we write code that satisfies
the basic minimum requirement of the deal,

02:33.760 --> 02:36.889
we are off the box and on to the platform.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.248
And that is my final offer.

02:39.720 --> 02:42.849
So, what do you say to that...

02:43.920 --> 02:44.921
- Whoa!
- Ow!

02:45.000 --> 02:46.525
- Richie!
- Oh, my God!

02:46.600 --> 02:48.170
Hey, hey. You okay?

02:48.240 --> 02:50.607
- You were standing and then what happened?
- Okay, I'm okay.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.523
-It's just a little shocking.
- Oh.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.001
What were you saying? Did you...
Do we have a deal or...

02:55.080 --> 02:58.084
Yeah, Richard, we have a deal.
You have a bloody nose.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.288
That was pretty badass, Richard.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.600
Until it wasn't.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.489
Uh, this is not even a room.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.523
This is a hallway.

03:19.320 --> 03:24.281
Uh, it can't be because that is a bed,
thus, this is a bedroom.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.527
Two entrances and exits, cross drafts ahoy.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.005
And it is the safest room in the event,
unlikely, of a fire.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.968
Ah. Oopsies. Don't mind me.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.769
Ah, Fred, this is Jared.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.571
He actually is, uh, a temporary resident.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.723
While I have you,
there were fresh droppings near my cot.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.801
I think you were right.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.565
The Havahart traps don't seem to be working.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.725
I was thinking maybe we could just pick a day
and just drench it in hawk urine,

03:51.800 --> 03:54.724
because the scent of a predator
can keep rodents at bay.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.122
It's funny, we're named Pied Piper,
but we're beset with rats.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.125
Little rascals.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.960
Fuck this.

04:06.040 --> 04:11.410
I've been writing quick, bullshit subpar code
for 48 hours, and I want to kill myself.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.322
How do you do it every day, Dinesh?

04:14.440 --> 04:15.601
What a coincidence.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.445
I've also been writing bullshit code
for 48 hours,

04:18.519 --> 04:20.567
and want you to kill yourself.

04:20.640 --> 04:24.281
Guys, please. Let's just shit this thing out
so we can get on to building the platform.

04:24.880 --> 04:25.881
Hi.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.845
- Hi.
- Dang.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.484
- What?
- I'm Dang.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.841
I'm dang?

04:33.360 --> 04:34.361
Dang.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.240
What...

04:36.320 --> 04:37.367
My name is Dang.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.131
Oh, my... I'm sorry. What can I do for you?

04:40.200 --> 04:43.170
I'm heading the design team
that's building the enclosure for the box.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.288
It's time for the concept meeting.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.210
"Concept meeting?"

04:48.360 --> 04:51.284
Okay. I'm just going to
show you a few pictures,

04:51.360 --> 04:53.362
and you tell me which ones you like, okay?

04:53.480 --> 04:54.720
Okay. Sure.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.682
Look... Wait, hold on.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.081
I thought you were going to
show me pictures of boxes.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.764
Like data storage devices.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.887
Before I can actualize a box,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.970
you and I need to develop
a shared aesthetic vocabulary.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.042
Otherwise, I have no idea
what you're going to want.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.247
I have a lot of work to do right now.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.846
This is work. This is my work.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.321
What we're doing here
could actually save time.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.731
Okay. Sure. Yeah...

05:28.800 --> 05:30.848
Look, let's just make this simple.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.685
If the box were an animal,
what sort of animal would it be?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.486
Leopard?

05:36.160 --> 05:38.162
Butterfly? Rhinoceros?

05:38.240 --> 05:40.049
Stop. Animal?

05:40.120 --> 05:41.690
It's a box. Right?

05:41.760 --> 05:46.368
Okay, so if you need an animal,
make it a box turtle. How does that sound?

05:46.960 --> 05:49.361
So this is all kind of a joke to you?

05:49.440 --> 05:53.525
You know what? I don't actually give
a flying fuck what this box looks like, okay?

05:53.600 --> 05:56.046
If it was up to me,
I wouldn't even have it in the first place.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.201
So, look, here.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.126
This is a black rectangle.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.726
Make it that, all right?

06:02.840 --> 06:05.366
Because we're going to take it
and put it in a hole

06:05.440 --> 06:07.886
in a sub-basement in a data center,
where no one can see it

06:07.960 --> 06:11.442
except for a sad man
named John with a ponytail. Okay?

06:11.520 --> 06:14.046
Just make it a box.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.327
And please turn off that fucking music.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.721
Hello!

06:29.600 --> 06:31.568
It appears there has been a mistake.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.325
Is this not my parking space?

06:34.400 --> 06:37.370
Sorry, a lot of premium spaces
are being reassigned.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.808
14-A, you've been reassigned to lot D.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.401
Lot D?

06:43.480 --> 06:44.970
The structure?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.325
Beyond the freeway?

06:48.400 --> 06:51.210
Anywhere above level three,
those are reserved.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.328
There's a shuttle stop on the ground level.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.847
A shuttle?

07:03.080 --> 07:05.731
Call Gavin Belson. Cell.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.167
Greetings, friend,

07:14.520 --> 07:17.285
<i>I'm not available right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

07:17.360 --> 07:19.328
<i>- I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
{HORN HONKS</i>

07:25.720 --> 07:27.165
What the fuck?
Why isn't this working?

07:27.880 --> 07:31.441
Gilfoyle's preprocessor and my compressor
should integrate seamlessly.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.691
This should work.

07:35.240 --> 07:39.325
I may have made my preprocessor
slightly faster than you asked me to, Richard.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.728
What do you mean?
How much "slightly faster"?

07:42.120 --> 07:43.565
200 megs per second.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.766
You dick.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.047
That's eight times as fast
as the specs required.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.282
No wonder our modules
aren't running at the same speed.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.566
Why would you do that?

07:50.720 --> 07:54.441
I tried to make it slow. I really did.
But I'm not Dinesh.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.288
It's very difficult for me to do shitty work.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.244
So, I added a differencing library

07:59.320 --> 08:01.891
and then the whole thing
just took off like a rocket.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.768
Wait, so you're not processing whole files,
just the changes?

08:05.880 --> 08:07.484
That's actually pretty cool.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.721
Yeah, I thought so, too.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.205
That's why I wrote it.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.562
All right, well,
I guess I should just revert back.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.485
Right?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.762
Slow my preprocessor way down.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.005
Although, Richard,

08:21.080 --> 08:25.642
couldn't you just rewrite the compressor
to make it faster so it's compatible?

08:25.720 --> 08:27.609
I mean, these are minimum speeds, right?

08:28.760 --> 08:33.004
Just 'cause making the box sucks
doesn't mean we have to suck at making it.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.645
Yeah. Okay. Um, here's one idea. Uh...

08:38.200 --> 08:41.602
What if we actually move upstream
and connect the parser...

08:41.679 --> 08:44.570
Directly to the compressor
seed functions.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.685
Okay.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.444
Well, then, the whole thing would really fly.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.444
- Yeah.
- That would rock.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.601
Hey, Richard, do you have a sec?

08:53.720 --> 08:55.484
I have a preliminary render for you.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.641
What is that?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.571
What do you mean? It's a box.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.202
That's not our box, is it?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.362
Yes. It's exactly what you asked me for.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.842
You drew a rectangle and said,
"if it was an animal, it'd be a box turtle."

09:11.920 --> 09:14.890
I mean, are you just going to do
the bare minimum and call it a day?

09:14.960 --> 09:16.121
I mean, is that, like, what you do?

09:16.240 --> 09:18.641
You said it didn't matter,
you said you didn't care.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.848
No one's caring about this.
I'm just saying, like,

09:20.920 --> 09:22.843
it's just a matter of pride
and, like, self-respect.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.251
I mean, that's gonna go on brochures, man,

09:24.320 --> 09:27.244
that's like an advertisement to you
and the company and everything.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.403
I can maybe add some color to it
and give the bezel a little slam.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.482
There you go. Definitely, a slam. Slam it.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.800
Yeah, maybe add some more lights.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.881
Sure. Yeah.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.122
Well, hey, what are you doing
standing around here talking about it?

09:37.200 --> 09:39.202
You should go do it, you know?
Go ahead and make the damn thing.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.682
Make it a jaguar 'cause I have a feeling
this baby is going to purr.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.845
I don't care either, but, you know,
I think maybe a gazelle is more like it.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.570
'Cause it's synonymous with speed.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.120
Fuck that. A cheetah's faster.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.611
And it kills fucking gazelles.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.091
But I really don't fucking care.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.924
But definitely cheetah.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.126
Or a gazelle.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.969
Also, don't throw away
the whole jaguar thing,

09:59.040 --> 10:00.530
-yeah, 'cause they're pretty quick too.
- Or a gazelle.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.163
Ah! Jared, Jesus fuck! What are you doing?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.765
Sorry. I was...

10:08.840 --> 10:11.525
I was just taking a quiet moment
to collect myself.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.605
What the hell is all this shit?

10:13.680 --> 10:16.604
My tenant has been leaving my belongings
in the alley behind my condo,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.370
to make more room for his tenants.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.726
Your tenant has tenants?

10:20.160 --> 10:21.207
Yeah.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.282
He's Airbnbing my Airbnb.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.570
So, if it's okay with you,
I might need to stay a little bit longer.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.803
Um, I can go around the back
to get to the bathroom once Fred's here.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.881
When's he moving in?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.724
Wouldn't we all like to know.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.724
Fred, Erlich Bachman.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.645
You said you'd get back to me
about the room.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.530
I don't mean to pressure you,
but I need you to decide now.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.648
In this moment, on this phone call.

10:45.720 --> 10:49.361
I am literally standing within feet
of three potential candidates

10:49.440 --> 10:52.205
whose selves I could easily tell to go fuck...

10:52.600 --> 10:55.604
"Good"? What do you mean "good"?
What does that mean, you're "good"?

10:56.600 --> 10:59.285
What? What other incubator? Where?

11:00.080 --> 11:01.730
What is the address?

11:02.080 --> 11:04.526
Because I want to send them
a fucking nice gift!

11:15.760 --> 11:18.843
<i>Fucking Miami Vice. Disgusting architecture!</i>

11:24.240 --> 11:26.561
Hey, man. What are you doing here?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.210
What the fuck are you doing here?

11:28.280 --> 11:30.521
What do you mean? This is my house.
Crazy, right?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.807
This place is huge.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.411
Did you want to...

11:37.960 --> 11:40.486
Yes, it would be polite
for you to invite me into your home

11:40.560 --> 11:42.483
and offer me a Push Pop, yes.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.686
I'm sorry.

11:43.760 --> 11:47.048
You're telling me that
we should spend less time together?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.770
Absolutely, Chela.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.241
Well, I have to say, this is a big relief.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.082
In all candor, I was feeling the same,

11:55.160 --> 11:59.370
but I thought that discussing it with you
might be awkward.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.324
Not at all.

12:01.640 --> 12:06.806
You are ready, Chela, to stand on your own,
to weather the challenges of the future.

12:07.360 --> 12:11.126
And the rumors swirling
about your leadership.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.406
Be well, Gavin.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.642
I'm sorry. Wait, what...

12:16.720 --> 12:18.051
What rumors?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.885
There is talk that
in the face of a growing threat

12:20.960 --> 12:24.681
from Richard Hendricks and Pied Piper,
armed with a powerful new CEO,

12:24.760 --> 12:26.444
that you have done nothing.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.646
- Well, yes, but...
- And that by shuttering Nucleus,

12:29.720 --> 12:32.530
you have left them
to gather strength unopposed,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.250
ceding the entire space.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.244
Some are saying
this is a show of great weakness.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.966
Who? Who exactly is saying this?

12:42.440 --> 12:44.090
Well, people talk.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.329
In the halls, in the cafeteria,
on the parking shuttle.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.165
Wait, should I be worried about this?

12:52.520 --> 12:57.208
The beauty is, now you have all the answers.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.007
Yes?

13:02.520 --> 13:03.760
All right.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.325
Denpok, please.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.688
Will you sit back down?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.205
I need your help.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.566
Of course.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.006
Thank you.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.687
Clearly, we have come far,
but we still have far to go.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.483
Not as far as lot D,

13:24.920 --> 13:26.410
but far nonetheless.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.251
Look what you guys built.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.526
You can't help but be elegant.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.648
You're like Audrey Hepburn.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.801
Here they come.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.042
Well, I know we made a big deal

13:37.120 --> 13:40.363
about just doing your
absolute minimum of your specs,

13:40.440 --> 13:43.011
but one thing led to another and, well, Jack,

13:43.080 --> 13:46.163
buckle your seat belt
because I'd like to introduce you to...

13:46.240 --> 13:48.242
Richard, just save it.

13:48.760 --> 13:52.401
Just got off the phone with
Calvin Greene, CEO of Maleant.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.649
- They're pulling out.
- What?

13:54.720 --> 13:56.006
How can they just pull out?

13:56.080 --> 13:57.161
Because they shopped our deal

13:57.240 --> 13:59.288
and got a better bid
from another appliance maker,

13:59.400 --> 14:01.607
so Maleant's out, they fucked us.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.000
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.882
So, probably we should just push pause
on the whole box thing

14:06.960 --> 14:10.328
until we figure out where to go from here.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.166
Okay. I... Actually, I have a question.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.210
Yeah, I know. I know.
I know, Richard, we had an arrangement,

14:17.280 --> 14:19.806
but that was all based on
closing the Maleant deal.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.161
- So now we have to figure out...
- No, no, no. Sorry.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.288
No, my question is, who did they go with?

14:24.360 --> 14:26.840
Whose box do they think
is that much better than ours?

14:27.120 --> 14:29.088
Oh, uh, Dectosphere.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.286
Dectosphere?

14:30.360 --> 14:32.124
It's a brick with a power cord.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.405
Yeah. But I hear their new 43-11 s,

14:35.520 --> 14:38.649
they're going to be hitting
close to 75 megs per second.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.962
Uh, we can do 200.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.325
- What?
- Yeah.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.880
Do you think you can get me in a room
with Calvin Greene?

14:47.960 --> 14:48.961
This is the pool.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.646
The first night I was here,
I turned the heat, like, all the way up,

14:51.720 --> 14:53.722
and half the water evaporated overnight.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.847
It's crazy.

14:54.920 --> 14:55.967
Well, I hope you own a skimmer

14:56.080 --> 14:59.801
because there's a massive turd
floating on the surface of your pool.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.881
Who, Fred? Fred's great, man.

15:02.960 --> 15:06.089
He's got this really cool,
um, malware cataloging thing...

15:06.160 --> 15:07.241
Cut the shit, Big Head.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.924
I see exactly what you're doing.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.206
Poaching my tenants?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.009
You stole my business model.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.329
What? No. Dude, it's not like that at all.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.085
It's just, this house has, like, nine bedrooms.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.810
You have any idea
how scary that gets at night?

15:19.280 --> 15:21.009
So I just wanted
to have some roommates around,

15:21.080 --> 15:23.287
but, you know, I felt weird charging them rent,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.243
-'cause, you know.
- No, I don't.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.842
Well, it's, like, 20 million, you know?
So I don't really need it,

15:28.920 --> 15:32.447
but then they felt weird
living here without paying me anything,

15:32.520 --> 15:35.046
so they offered me pieces of their start-ups.
That's all.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.802
You just admitted to starting
a competing incubator.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.727
I've caught you in a web
of your own lies, haven't I?

15:42.440 --> 15:44.761
I don't think so. Wait, have you?

15:44.880 --> 15:46.609
All right, Big Head.
You want to play it that way?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.445
If it's a fight you want,
then a fight you shall have.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.760
All of you!

15:53.200 --> 15:54.565
See you, buddy.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.360
Big Head.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.247
We'll see.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.611
Fuck!

16:14.680 --> 16:15.966
What are we doing here?

16:17.200 --> 16:18.929
Why are we fighting like this?

16:19.040 --> 16:22.044
I mean, I'm gonna steal your guys,
you're gonna steal my guys.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.930
We'll both wield the heft
of our considerable fortunes

16:25.000 --> 16:27.287
until each of us have nearly nothing left.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.601
Is that really what you want? Me either.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.363
So what do you say we join forces?

16:32.440 --> 16:33.851
I'm big enough.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.042
Are you, Big Head?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.081
Partners?

16:39.920 --> 16:40.921
Okay.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.241
Atta boy.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.607
All right, I'm going to take a spin
on that fancy Japanese toilet,

16:44.680 --> 16:46.091
and then let's get to work

16:46.160 --> 16:49.528
figuring out which one of these bedrooms
is gonna be my office.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.729
Consider the bulldog.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.005
A grotesque monstrosity
born of relentless inbreeding.

16:58.120 --> 17:01.602
Riddled with sinusitis, crippled by joint pain,

17:02.160 --> 17:04.401
chronically flatulent.

17:05.599 --> 17:09.286
A kindly pet, or humanity's cruelest mistake?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.609
All right, take it away.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.167
Ladies and gentlemen,
just like that horrible creature,

17:18.240 --> 17:21.608
the entire Nucleus program
was the result of inbreeding.

17:21.680 --> 17:26.163
We mated Hooli engineers
with Hooli designers in a Hooli kennel.

17:26.240 --> 17:30.450
Is it any wonder the result was
just as unspeakable as that thing?

17:30.920 --> 17:32.126
Bring it back here!

17:33.280 --> 17:35.521
Look at that hideous face.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.809
All right, get it out of here!

17:39.320 --> 17:41.402
I'm sorry, Gavin. What's your point?

17:41.480 --> 17:45.246
My point is, just as not all dogs
are as flawed as the bulldog,

17:45.320 --> 17:49.006
not all compression plays
are as flawed as Nucleus.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.562
Our execution was lacking,
but the idea was correct.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.847
Our only mistake was looking inward.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.809
It is now time to look outward.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.890
I mean, this guy did all of the work.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.201
Ten minutes after we leave
Calvin Greene's office,

18:07.280 --> 18:10.170
he calls me up and says,
"Hey, you got me. How much?"

18:10.240 --> 18:11.401
I just showed them the box,

18:11.480 --> 18:13.369
Jack's the one who made the deal.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.083
Good feelings, happy feelings.

18:16.680 --> 18:21.686
So, Big Head built a better version
of your incubator, accidentally.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.091
Correct.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.650
And he didn't even realize it?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.131
Also correct.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.602
And your solution to that was
to go into business with him?

18:29.680 --> 18:30.727
Big Head?

18:30.800 --> 18:35.044
The guy you once called more useless
than a bag of dicks without a handle?

18:35.120 --> 18:38.090
Dinesh, don't fall for his "aw, shucks" routine.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.083
He is a shrewd businessman.

18:40.160 --> 18:46.566
And together, we have over
$20,036,000 at our disposal.

18:47.200 --> 18:51.171
Now, if you'll excuse me, on to Pied Piper.

18:51.880 --> 18:56.090
I have a board meeting,
and this board ain't exactly gonna meet itself.

18:57.680 --> 19:01.366
Our subsequent order of business
is the approval of Pied Piper's redraft

19:01.440 --> 19:05.411
of the hardware requisition agreement
with Maleant Data Systems Solutions.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.766
Oh, yeah.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.410
The main event.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.326
We've all read
the latest sales agreement, yes?

19:12.400 --> 19:14.368
Actually, I don't think I was CC'd on...

19:14.440 --> 19:16.568
So, I believe
we can move straight forward to a vote?

19:16.640 --> 19:17.801
Actually, I'm sorry.

19:17.880 --> 19:21.089
I have an issue with, uh, section 14,
paragraph two.

19:21.600 --> 19:26.447
Um, it states that Maleant has exclusive rights
to purchase any appliance made by Pied Piper

19:26.560 --> 19:28.164
for the next five years.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.527
Oh, uh, yeah.
Jack gave them exclusive rights to the box

19:30.600 --> 19:32.284
so that we would get a better price upfront.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.482
Right, but this language is far broader.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.406
They actually have exclusive rights
to use the underlying algorithm in any form.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.891
Oh, no. That's not right at all.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.286
Yeah, so I think, Jack,

19:41.360 --> 19:44.125
we're going to have to go back to them
and just change the language here.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.926
We're not going to be able to do that.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.168
And, uh, why not?

19:52.240 --> 19:56.484
Because that was the specific language
which Maleant requested

19:56.560 --> 20:00.770
when I got them to pay three times as much
for each one of our boxes.

20:00.840 --> 20:06.085
It's a white label deal, so they have the right
to resell these boxes in any form they choose.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.209
Yeah, but, Jack,
if they have exclusive rights to the algorithm,

20:09.280 --> 20:12.124
then we can't use the algorithm
to build the platform.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.531
For five years.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.443
They wanted seven, I talked them down.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.760
I know, but you said that we could

20:16.840 --> 20:18.365
build the platform once we gave you the box.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.411
Yes, but I never specified a time frame.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.811
Are you serious?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.721
I save your ass
and you stab me in the back like this?

20:25.800 --> 20:26.767
In the front, Richard.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.205
Laurie, did you know about this?

20:29.040 --> 20:31.122
- I did not.
- Well, then, good, okay.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.010
So it won't go through
because Laurie's not going to vote for it.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.927
Richard, this is complicated.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.727
If one goes strictly
by the numbers, these numbers,

20:42.800 --> 20:46.725
you have built a box that is so valuable,

20:46.800 --> 20:49.406
I am now obligated to vote in favor of it.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.369
Laurie, this deal is peanuts.

20:52.040 --> 20:55.601
The platform could be worth
1,000 times what the box is worth.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.445
It could be, correct, however...

20:58.520 --> 21:01.410
This is theoretical, Richard.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.130
You don't have a price point, I do,

21:03.240 --> 21:06.562
and she has a fiduciary obligation
as a member of the board

21:06.640 --> 21:07.880
to vote for the box.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.282
On the page, this is in the best interest
of the company.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.407
Am I wrong, Laurie?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.050
That is factually correct.

21:15.920 --> 21:19.049
You remember when you tried to end run me
and kill the box?

21:19.120 --> 21:21.407
Well, she couldn't do
a goddamn thing about it then.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.051
And she can't do
a goddamn thing about it now.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.450
Simple majority ratifies
the agreement, all in favor.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.364
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck is going on right now?

21:32.560 --> 21:33.766
Laurie.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.320
I wasn't carbon copied
on this particular email,

21:36.440 --> 21:37.646
so, I stand with Richard.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.561
Um...

21:42.240 --> 21:46.404
Richard, you know how
I voted to fire you a couple months ago?

21:46.480 --> 21:48.448
And I said that I did it to stay in the game,

21:48.520 --> 21:51.888
so that maybe at some point in the future,
I could do something to help?

21:52.960 --> 21:54.883
Well, Laurie,

21:55.720 --> 21:58.200
I know you'll probably
replace me on the board

21:58.280 --> 22:01.602
and call for a revote tomorrow,
but I'm here today.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.641
And I don't have any metrics to back it up,

22:05.760 --> 22:09.242
but I honestly believe that
the platform that Richard wants to build

22:09.320 --> 22:12.767
will be far more lucrative
in the long term than any box.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.688
So, at least for today, I'm voting no.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.451
Motion denied.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.643
We will be reconvening tomorrow.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.931
And if I could get a...
An email, be CC'd on the latest draft...

22:36.920 --> 22:38.888
I couldn't sit there
and watch them do that to you.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.207
I just hope I don't end up fired over this.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.047
Well, what you did took incredible guts.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.607
And the fact that
it probably won't make any difference

22:46.680 --> 22:48.170
makes it all the more meaningful.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.204
Right, I saw this nature documentary

22:51.280 --> 22:55.205
where a bison fought a lion
to protect the rest of the herd.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.964
And it was so moving.

22:57.200 --> 23:01.728
It didn't work, the lion tore into the bison
and then laid waste to the herd,

23:01.800 --> 23:03.689
but what courage.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.770
Thank you, Jared.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.411
You guys just had to make a great box,
didn't you?

23:09.480 --> 23:10.766
You couldn't phone it in.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.649
Uh, guys, Gavin Belson is calling me. Again.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.166
What the fuck does he want?

23:19.160 --> 23:20.161
Hello?

23:20.280 --> 23:23.921
Richard Hendricks, just checking in,
seeing if you heard the news.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.561
What news?

23:25.920 --> 23:29.925
Hmm. Obviously, you don't have your
Hooli news alerts up to date.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.730
Go to the site. I'll wait.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.964
Go to the Hooli news website.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.041
Okay.

23:40.800 --> 23:41.847
It's an ad.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.009
It's an ad. Hold on.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.327
Just wait four seconds
and you can click to skip it.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.842
Just wait four seconds
and then you can click it.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.287
No, it's the kind where you have to watch
the whole fucking thing.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.771
It's the whole ad kind.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.128
I thought we stopped doing those.
God damn it.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.124
<i>Well, regardless, what you'll see
once the paid announcement is over</i>

24:00.240 --> 24:04.768
is that I just closed a $250 million deal

24:04.880 --> 24:07.804
to acquire a little company called EndFrame.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.609
<i>I thought you'd want to know.</i>

24:09.680 --> 24:11.967
<i>Update those Hooli news alerts.</i>

24:12.040 --> 24:15.203
Also, I invite you to click "yes"
if our ad experience was relevant to you.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.611
<i>Be well, Richard.</i>

24:18.720 --> 24:19.926
What did he say?

24:20.680 --> 24:21.966
Oh, my God.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.405
"Gavin Belson announces deal
to acquire EndFrame,

24:25.480 --> 24:27.801
"a middle-out compression
platform company,

24:28.040 --> 24:30.691
"for $250 million."

24:31.800 --> 24:36.567
Even after they shit the bed with Nucleus,
Hooli gets to build our platform and we don't?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.326
What is funny about this?

24:42.400 --> 24:43.811
He's intoxicated.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.963
No. No... Yes, but don't you see?

24:47.400 --> 24:50.563
Gavin, in trying to fuck us,
just saved our asses.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.411
He's right. He's right.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.047
My gosh. Oh, my gosh, he's right.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.485
Holy shit.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.604
I am so confused right now.

25:02.680 --> 25:03.681
Gavin set a...

25:05.920 --> 25:07.206
He set the...

25:07.280 --> 25:08.964
- The price point.
- Yes!

25:09.040 --> 25:11.771
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, thanks to Gavin,

25:11.840 --> 25:14.525
EndFrame, a middle-out
compression platform,

25:14.600 --> 25:17.171
is objectively worth $250 million.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.366
Wait, okay.

25:19.160 --> 25:22.482
We are a
middle-out compression platform company.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.961
Are we worth $250 million?

25:25.040 --> 25:27.042
There's no way the box
makes us worth a fraction of that.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.690
Laurie couldn't vote for the platform

25:28.760 --> 25:31.001
because she couldn't assign
a dollar value to it.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.128
Well, Gavin has just done that.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.124
He's validated the market,
so there's no reason to revote

25:36.200 --> 25:37.690
We win.

25:37.760 --> 25:41.321
I can't wait to see the look
on that AAR prick's face

25:41.400 --> 25:44.210
when we come in there and gut him like a...

25:46.280 --> 25:47.441
Is he okay?

25:47.520 --> 25:48.885
He's gonna be fine.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.367
Welcome, men and ladies of EndFrame.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.728
Rather than incestuously promoting
the same faces from within,

25:54.800 --> 25:58.247
you represent fresh blood, new ideas.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.607
Everything Nucleus was not.

26:00.680 --> 26:05.481
It is my honor to personally
welcome you all to Hooli.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.168
Does he really not remember us?

26:10.240 --> 26:13.562
How long did you work at Hooli?
The last time?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.085
Seven years.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.764
I was here for nine.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.171
He was invited to my wedding.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.163
I hope Jack doesn't cry.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.809
I really hope he does.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.006
Hey, Gloria. Lynn.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.771
Did they both get fired?

26:32.840 --> 26:34.080
I don't...

26:35.560 --> 26:37.289
Laurie. What are you doing here?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.600
Where's Jack?

26:41.160 --> 26:42.286
As you may recall,

26:42.360 --> 26:46.001
at our board meeting last night,
Jack said that he would get his way,

26:46.080 --> 26:48.128
and that, in his words,

26:48.200 --> 26:51.921
I, quote, couldn't do
a goddamn thing about it, end quote.

26:52.560 --> 26:56.281
Well, in light of recent activities,

26:56.360 --> 26:59.045
it appears that
I could do a goddamn thing about it.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.724
And I just did.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.643
Jack Barker has been exited.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.131
Fuck me sideways.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.406
Indeed.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.566
Effective immediately,

27:07.640 --> 27:11.201
you are all at liberty to commence work
upon the platform.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.128
Okay. Uh, wow.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.850
Yeah, I just got to ask,

27:17.920 --> 27:21.811
with Jack not being CEO anymore,
am I CEO again?

27:21.880 --> 27:22.927
You are not.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.805
Nor are you, Mr. Bachman.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.724
I'm sorry, if I'm not CEO,
Erlich isn't, Jack isn't,

27:28.800 --> 27:30.802
who is gonna run Pied Piper then?

27:31.800 --> 27:34.246
Officially, and until further notice,

27:35.240 --> 27:37.447
this chair will remain empty.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.122
- What, really?
- Excuse me.
