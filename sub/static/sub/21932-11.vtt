00:53.573 --> 00:55.996
Henry will be happy that you're here.

00:56.061 --> 00:59.418
Oh, yes. He's mentioned
it at least a dozen times.

00:59.543 --> 01:02.043
This is his first game with the team.

01:02.112 --> 01:04.673
A rather important one, I hear.

01:05.916 --> 01:08.750
- Oh...
- Look, it's Murdoch!

01:10.816 --> 01:12.213
I must say,

01:12.526 --> 01:15.095
I'm surprised how popular it is.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.902
Look at all these people!

01:17.846 --> 01:19.508
Do you know the rules?

01:19.633 --> 01:21.231
Not in the slightest.

01:24.768 --> 01:25.790
Oh...

01:25.809 --> 01:29.359
that must be the Serbian
count that Henry mentioned.

01:29.484 --> 01:31.773
His family was recently outed

01:31.782 --> 01:34.550
in a coup a few years ago.

01:34.675 --> 01:35.960
Hmm!

01:36.429 --> 01:40.068
There is something rather
swarthy about him, isn't there?

01:42.565 --> 01:46.273
Look at how the players are
positioned strategically on the field,

01:46.303 --> 01:48.243
a line of defence anticipating

01:48.254 --> 01:51.541
any and all outcomes.

01:51.714 --> 01:54.351
Julia, this is quite a lot.

01:54.368 --> 01:56.366
Are we expecting someone?

02:00.016 --> 02:01.852
Yes, we are, William.

02:03.493 --> 02:05.513
Oh, you... you don't mean...

02:05.560 --> 02:07.062
I do.

02:07.269 --> 02:08.887
It actually worked?

02:09.118 --> 02:11.012
We're having a baby!

02:11.432 --> 02:14.858
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh!

02:15.670 --> 02:17.426
Oh, I'm very sorry. Are you all right?

02:17.466 --> 02:20.472
- Of course. I'm not made of glass.
- I...

02:20.650 --> 02:23.063
I don't know what to say.

02:24.433 --> 02:25.953
I love you.

02:26.132 --> 02:28.031
I love you too, William.

02:29.447 --> 02:31.529
And I couldn't be happier.

02:31.563 --> 02:34.225
But I do think that we
should keep this between us,

02:34.242 --> 02:37.431
- at least for a little while.
- Right. Right.

02:40.472 --> 02:42.860
Isn't there a law against
that kind of thing?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.039
Have you got something to hide?

02:49.140 --> 02:50.838
Are you enjoying the game, sir?

02:50.890 --> 02:52.215
Ah, not really.

02:52.261 --> 02:55.386
England may have exported
the rules, but not the talent.

02:55.511 --> 02:58.916
Here we go! Come on!

02:59.041 --> 03:00.240
Look at that.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.981
Ridiculous! The batsman's
stance is all wrong.

03:03.171 --> 03:06.608
- Come on, Higgins! Get a move on!
- Oh, Inspector!

03:06.856 --> 03:09.043
One does not yell at a cricket match.

03:09.078 --> 03:11.196
Oh, really? Is that what this is?

03:11.231 --> 03:14.714
Rupu! Oh, that's Rupert, my brother.

03:15.204 --> 03:16.793
The alive one.

03:25.221 --> 03:27.518
He's quite something.

03:28.410 --> 03:32.488
Doesn't my Henry look so
dashing in his uniform?

03:32.524 --> 03:34.358
He is fitting in quite well here.

03:34.483 --> 03:36.940
They're referred to as
whites, Miss Newsome.

03:37.128 --> 03:39.197
Oh. Is this the Serbian count

03:39.226 --> 03:42.322
- that's been staying with you?
- Oh, yes. Count Dagon Petrovitch.

03:42.368 --> 03:45.086
He said our estate was
the finest he'd ever seen.

03:45.155 --> 03:47.124
He has impeccable taste.

04:09.410 --> 04:10.843
Oh!

04:10.866 --> 04:12.979
The rules in Serbia
must be quite different.

04:18.603 --> 04:21.113
Don't worry, you can take him!

04:27.728 --> 04:29.572
Oh!

04:30.136 --> 04:34.551
- Go on, lad! Get after him!
- Oh, Inspector, it's...

04:43.628 --> 04:45.611
This is as bad as hockey.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.284
Perhaps the other ball had a defect.

04:53.353 --> 04:55.080
If this batsman's
anything like the last one,

04:55.092 --> 04:57.187
he won't make a blind bit of difference.

05:21.983 --> 05:25.046
Bloody hell!

05:37.439 --> 05:40.318
Julia... perhaps you shouldn't.

05:40.347 --> 05:43.225
- Why not?
- This was particularly violent,

05:43.242 --> 05:45.050
and what with your condition,

05:45.085 --> 05:47.642
I thought it might be best
to let Miss Hart handle it.

05:47.676 --> 05:49.859
Nonsense, William!

05:49.893 --> 05:53.927
Just because I'm accompanying doesn't
mean I can't do my job properly.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.831
All right.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.587
Front foot planted firmly
down the crease. Head down.

06:05.638 --> 06:07.976
Strong follow through,
and fours will come.

06:08.017 --> 06:11.328
Six is strictly for the
anarchists. Here endeth the lesson.

06:12.042 --> 06:15.042
So this one's different. Any thoughts?

06:16.159 --> 06:17.258
Murdoch?

06:17.937 --> 06:21.859
Yes, sir. It would appear someone
put explosive inside the ball.

06:21.868 --> 06:23.053
We all saw that.

06:23.178 --> 06:24.258
Sirs?

06:24.283 --> 06:26.148
The count is ready
to speak when you are.

06:26.273 --> 06:28.644
Yes. Henry, tell us about the victim.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.539
Michael O'Donnell, sir.

06:30.561 --> 06:32.546
He'd been a part of the
professionals team for some years,

06:32.565 --> 06:33.969
from what I understand.

06:35.047 --> 06:36.787
And the history between the teams?

06:36.847 --> 06:40.500
Well, sir, as you may have heard
me mention several times this week,

06:40.859 --> 06:43.162
they are all professional
cricket players.

06:43.185 --> 06:46.146
Every year, they face off
against us, the Gentlemen.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.182
We are hobbyists of some distinction.

06:48.215 --> 06:50.591
So basically, a bunch of rich buggers

06:50.647 --> 06:53.511
pay to be humiliated by professionals.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.255
Mr. O'Donnell was sledging the count
in the lead up to the game, sir.

06:57.278 --> 06:59.895
- "Sledging"?
- A form of mental intimidation.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.463
He and some teammates would show
up at practice and taunt the count,

07:03.537 --> 07:06.456
- yell insults, that sort of thing.
- For what purpose?

07:06.581 --> 07:09.375
Sir, some people simply
resent us for our wealth.

07:09.444 --> 07:11.574
Brewster? Here.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.968
- Sir?
- Take Miss Newsome home

07:14.003 --> 07:16.260
and then lay out my formal
attire for this evening.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.610
I have an engagement
at the club tonight.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.646
What just happened? Who
the bloody hell is Brewster?

07:26.771 --> 07:29.581
Oh, Ruth insisted I take
on a manservant, sir.

07:29.609 --> 07:31.872
Part of my "transformation,"
as she calls it.

07:32.045 --> 07:34.872
Ah, yes. You seem to
have adjusted quite well.

07:34.935 --> 07:37.693
Sir, I feel it's the life
I should have always lived.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.431
Animal!

07:39.604 --> 07:41.526
You killed him, you Serbian bastard!

07:41.567 --> 07:43.616
- What are you saying?
- I know it was you.

07:43.645 --> 07:45.528
- You are a madman.
- Who is that man?

07:45.580 --> 07:48.815
Sam McTier, sir. He was
also sledging the count.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.440
I believe he was quite
close to O'Donnell.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.554
Why aren't you arresting
him? He blew up my friend.

07:54.577 --> 07:56.634
I mean, my God, this is his blood.

07:56.759 --> 07:59.729
Yes. I'm very sorry for
the loss of your friend,

07:59.752 --> 08:01.681
but I still have questions.

08:01.974 --> 08:04.720
What do you think was the
count's motive for doing this?

08:04.761 --> 08:07.536
- We embarrassed him.
- But why?

08:08.025 --> 08:11.469
This game is our chance to show
these twits they can't just buy glory.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.599
You know, we've been
trousing them for years.

08:13.645 --> 08:15.631
But then we heard about
this count, that he was...

08:15.677 --> 08:16.938
he was a ringer.

08:16.961 --> 08:20.317
Did Mr. O'Donnell have
direct contact with the count?

08:20.375 --> 08:23.052
No, so. At least, I don't think so.

08:23.984 --> 08:26.114
We just wanted him to
know we were watching.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.499
Only a maniac would do this,
Detective. He has to hang!

08:31.767 --> 08:36.631
- Mr. Petrovitch?
- Count Petrovitch, or my Lord, if you prefer.

08:36.804 --> 08:40.410
Detective Murdoch, Inspector
Brackenreid, Toronto Constabulary.

08:42.179 --> 08:45.481
Why did you switch balls
just prior to the explosion?

08:45.606 --> 08:47.508
The stitching was coming loose.

08:47.542 --> 08:50.162
This is why I nearly hit that poor man.

08:50.287 --> 08:52.790
It looked to me like
you did it on purpose.

08:53.916 --> 08:56.282
Do you play cricket, Inspector?

08:56.605 --> 08:59.663
I'm from Yorkshire. Of course I do.

08:59.698 --> 09:01.563
And I'm a damn sight
better than you lot.

09:01.580 --> 09:04.568
Then you will understand what I mean
when I say the ball was drifting.

09:04.591 --> 09:06.980
I merely exchanged it for a better one.

09:07.913 --> 09:10.723
The victim, Mr.
O'Donnell, and Mr. McTier,

09:10.752 --> 09:13.411
had been antagonizing you in
the days prior to the match?

09:13.596 --> 09:17.902
Yes! Very unsportsmanlike for
professional cricket players

09:17.949 --> 09:21.050
- in my humble opinion.
- Did you retaliate in any way?

09:21.096 --> 09:22.586
Detective,

09:22.621 --> 09:24.822
I was in the Serbian army.

09:25.155 --> 09:26.974
If I wanted to kill that man,

09:26.997 --> 09:29.404
I would have just shot him like a dog...

09:29.962 --> 09:31.684
which I have done.

09:34.015 --> 09:36.309
Thank you... Count.

09:36.434 --> 09:38.177
We will be in touch.

09:40.054 --> 09:41.305
Henry?

09:43.393 --> 09:46.865
Where do the players obtain
their cricket equipment?

09:46.990 --> 09:50.049
The only sporting goods store
in town, sir: Christianson's.

09:50.072 --> 09:52.928
Right. Have constables
fetch a new ball for me

09:52.957 --> 09:54.811
and bring it round to the station house.

09:54.936 --> 09:57.661
Oh, and, uh... I'll need a saw.

10:00.579 --> 10:04.461
The centre is cork, layered
with tightly-wound string.

10:04.586 --> 10:07.229
It's possible someone could
have made their own ball

10:07.246 --> 10:09.233
and encased an explosive inside.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.289
I imagine an assembled ball
could also be tampered with,

10:12.295 --> 10:13.815
with the right tools.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.640
It would be more
difficult, but possible.

10:16.675 --> 10:18.709
If it was filled with explosive,

10:18.834 --> 10:20.608
why didn't it blow on the first bounce?

10:20.619 --> 10:23.452
We can assume they used a
less volatile combustible:

10:23.498 --> 10:27.240
leadite, nitroglycerine.
Both are relatively common.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.020
I'll know more once I
examine the ball fragments.

10:30.055 --> 10:32.951
The constables are scouring
the field as we speak.

10:32.974 --> 10:35.623
I'll see if Dr. Ogden has
completed the post-mortem.

10:35.692 --> 10:37.356
That may give us something.

10:37.408 --> 10:40.493
Oh, the... the good
doctor. Is she all right?

10:40.528 --> 10:42.309
She looked a bit flushed earlier.

10:42.543 --> 10:43.999
Oh...

10:44.011 --> 10:46.236
just the excitement
of the game, I'm sure.

10:46.487 --> 10:47.978
Ah...

10:48.559 --> 10:51.870
Ah, the sound of willow on leather.

11:00.454 --> 11:02.492
Oh! What's this?

11:02.515 --> 11:05.238
- These are for your table.
- Oh!

11:05.791 --> 11:09.369
And this is a tonic in powder form

11:09.404 --> 11:11.571
meant to ease the symptoms of nausea.

11:11.696 --> 11:14.107
How thoughtful. Thank you.

11:14.889 --> 11:16.967
I'll put these in some water.

11:17.358 --> 11:18.869
How are you feeling?

11:19.680 --> 11:23.093
I'm fine, William. Honestly.

11:23.958 --> 11:27.739
We can live our lives normally,
at least for a little while.

11:27.808 --> 11:29.747
It's all I can think about lately.

11:30.448 --> 11:32.123
It is exciting.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.767
After everything we've been through...

11:36.020 --> 11:37.926
it almost feels like a dream.

11:38.257 --> 11:40.023
Well, almost.

11:40.058 --> 11:41.730
Ah, yes. Have you finished?

11:41.790 --> 11:45.429
I removed the debris. What was
left of him was badly damaged.

11:46.064 --> 11:48.723
Did you happen to find any
fragments of the ball itself?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.331
I need to determine the explosive.

11:50.350 --> 11:52.192
Well, that's the odd
thing. There weren't any.

11:52.234 --> 11:54.292
Just splinters of wood from the bat.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.208
Strange. It should've blown up with it.

11:56.254 --> 11:58.959
Perhaps the explosion
incinerated it completely.

11:58.982 --> 12:00.690
I don't think the exothermic force

12:00.709 --> 12:02.311
would've been powerful enough for that.

12:02.358 --> 12:04.030
There should be at
least some trace of it.

12:04.108 --> 12:05.554
One would think.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.621
Well, I should get back and
re-examine the evidence, then.

12:13.296 --> 12:14.387
Oh!

12:19.261 --> 12:22.623
Constable McNabb said it was in
the range of the rest of the debris.

12:22.655 --> 12:24.074
He thought it might be something.

12:24.396 --> 12:26.538
It appears to be a plug of some kind.

12:27.081 --> 12:29.633
Well, at least we know the
ball wasn't the explosive.

12:29.647 --> 12:31.227
It's nearly intact.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.313
Well, sir, that would mean that
the count is innocent, then.

12:34.603 --> 12:36.523
One step at a time, Henry.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.575
So the bomb was in the bat.

12:43.700 --> 12:44.772
I believe so, sir.

12:44.799 --> 12:46.816
So what exactly happened
to this little chap, then?

12:46.835 --> 12:49.456
If I'm correct, the plug
that killed this squirrel

12:49.474 --> 12:51.463
was used to hold the
explosive inside the bat,

12:51.472 --> 12:52.946
which must've been hollowed out.

12:52.983 --> 12:55.213
- So when the ball hit the bat...
- It triggered the explosion,

12:55.249 --> 12:57.769
which blew the plug
out with some velocity.

12:57.948 --> 13:00.814
So poor little Sammy here
was an innocent bystander.

13:00.854 --> 13:02.161
Well, that's tragic.

13:02.846 --> 13:05.067
Henry, how do the
players go about choosing

13:05.079 --> 13:06.731
which bats they'll use in a game?

13:06.789 --> 13:08.279
Are they shared?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.317
Not on our team, sir.

13:10.648 --> 13:12.315
You have your own bat, Higgins?!

13:12.378 --> 13:15.084
Of course, sir. It's named Ruth.

13:15.209 --> 13:17.800
You've named your bat
after your lady friend?!

13:17.973 --> 13:19.790
What about the professionals?

13:19.824 --> 13:22.337
Oh, I believe they may
share equipment, sir.

13:22.521 --> 13:24.191
So whoever made the bomb

13:24.231 --> 13:25.623
either handed it to O'Donnell

13:25.637 --> 13:27.562
or placed it where they
knew he'd pick it up.

13:27.687 --> 13:30.975
Henry, did you happen to see
if someone handed him the bat?

13:31.008 --> 13:32.509
Actually, yes, sir.

13:34.905 --> 13:36.415
Mr. McTier?

13:37.769 --> 13:39.943
Detective. Inspector.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.913
Have you arrested the murderer?

13:41.936 --> 13:45.069
Actually, there's a strong
chance we're looking right at him.

13:45.194 --> 13:46.299
What?

13:46.372 --> 13:49.427
Who gave Mr. O'Donnell the
bat he used in the game?

13:49.468 --> 13:50.859
I, uh...

13:51.172 --> 13:53.296
I don't remember. Why?

13:53.554 --> 13:56.264
- The bomb that killed him was inside it.
- What?!

13:56.853 --> 13:59.037
- How is that possible?
- It just is!

13:59.162 --> 14:02.011
Mr. McTier, who handed him the bat?

14:03.560 --> 14:06.336
I did. But I had no idea!

14:06.583 --> 14:09.439
- Please, I'm not lying.
- You understand, we get that quite a lot.

14:09.564 --> 14:12.433
The bat wasn't even one of
ours. It was the count's.

14:12.497 --> 14:15.682
You handed Mr. O'Donnell
the count's personal bat?

14:15.705 --> 14:18.048
- Why?
- It was stupid.

14:18.173 --> 14:20.587
We thought we'd score on
him with his poncy bat,

14:20.616 --> 14:22.129
then parade it in front of him.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.840
How did you know it was the count's?

14:23.880 --> 14:25.372
It had an engraved handle.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.058
Did anyone else know of your plans?

14:27.092 --> 14:29.067
- Other teammates, perhaps?
- No.

14:31.008 --> 14:33.696
Please! I could never
kill another human being.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.390
We may need to speak
with you further on this.

14:36.707 --> 14:38.342
Of course, Detective.

14:41.278 --> 14:42.648
So no one else knew.

14:42.773 --> 14:45.728
Which means Mr. O'Donnell
was not the intended victim.

14:45.853 --> 14:48.002
Someone was trying to kill the count.

15:01.121 --> 15:04.310
Oh, my dear, sweet Natasha.

15:05.076 --> 15:07.701
In all the commotion, I
thought she'd been stolen.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.822
So she's responsible
for this man's death?

15:11.863 --> 15:14.253
Well, the explosive inside of it...

15:14.281 --> 15:17.693
- her... yes.
- How awful!

15:17.743 --> 15:19.217
Tea?

15:19.816 --> 15:22.767
When was the bat last
used prior to the game?

15:22.824 --> 15:24.966
At our last practice, the day before.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.582
Then I believe she was
placed in my stall overnight.

15:27.639 --> 15:30.288
Do you know of anyone who
had access to the change rooms

15:30.316 --> 15:33.632
- who may have wished you harm?
- I can't think of a single person.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.930
The count is loved by all, Detective.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.570
Unless you consider the Bulgarians...

15:39.226 --> 15:41.508
but few do.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.639
"The Bulgarians"?

15:44.696 --> 15:48.159
The count fought in the battle of
Pirot during the Serbo-Bulgarian war.

15:48.180 --> 15:52.603
- He's a war hero.
- I was merely doing my duty, my dear Ruth.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.356
Though you're not the first to say it.

15:57.025 --> 16:00.549
Yes. Well, are there
any Bulgarians in Toronto

16:00.549 --> 16:03.502
- who may wish to harm you?
- No.

16:03.905 --> 16:06.058
Only those men on the other team.

16:06.997 --> 16:09.343
Right. Thank you, Count.

16:09.848 --> 16:11.339
Miss Newsome.

16:11.368 --> 16:14.931
Oh, it may be best for
you to remain out of sight

16:14.972 --> 16:17.876
until we can determine what is going on.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.236
But the game has been rescheduled
for tomorrow afternoon.

16:22.179 --> 16:25.677
I will not hide like some
Macedonian, Detective!

16:25.802 --> 16:28.665
Whoever did this, let them come.

16:31.146 --> 16:33.758
Is there anyone else who
could've got into the equipment?

16:33.793 --> 16:35.593
Not that I know of, sir.

16:35.718 --> 16:37.335
The killer must have gained access

16:37.352 --> 16:39.598
to the change room prior to the game.

16:39.723 --> 16:42.154
It's the only time the
bomb could've been planted.

16:42.568 --> 16:46.037
Henry, who was the last person to
leave practice the night before?

16:46.298 --> 16:48.757
That would be Dr. Newsome, sir.

16:48.780 --> 16:50.455
It was his turn to gather
the equipment afterwards.

16:50.507 --> 16:52.740
- You take turns?
- Yes, sir. Alphabetically.

16:52.752 --> 16:54.428
Ridgewell Munt did it the night before.

16:54.462 --> 16:57.779
- Right. Bring in Mr. Newsome.
- It's Dr. Newsome.

16:58.262 --> 16:59.678
...Sir.

17:01.135 --> 17:02.839
Higgins...

17:03.277 --> 17:05.734
Does your man have to
stand out there like that?

17:06.742 --> 17:08.987
It would be undignified
to let him sit, sir.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.662
But why is he here?

17:10.979 --> 17:13.760
- To tend to my needs, of course.
- What bloody "needs"?

17:13.933 --> 17:16.553
You'd be surprised how many I have.

17:17.653 --> 17:19.224
Come, Brewster.

17:22.385 --> 17:24.176
Thank you for coming in, Doctor.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.078
If I may, what sort of doctor are you?

17:27.203 --> 17:28.947
A cardiac surgeon.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.752
A surgeon! Oh.

17:30.792 --> 17:33.888
And what hospital do
you practice out of?

17:34.013 --> 17:37.285
I don't practice,
Detective! I'm a gentleman,

17:37.323 --> 17:41.289
a man of titles. I leave
it to others to... perform.

17:41.764 --> 17:43.203
I see.

17:44.095 --> 17:46.628
Doctor... Newsome, to your knowledge,

17:46.665 --> 17:49.520
were you the last person
to leave the change room

17:49.535 --> 17:53.648
- the night before the murder?
- As far as I know, yes.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.176
And do you recall
collecting the count's bat?

17:56.385 --> 18:00.781
Vaguely. There are over a dozen
bats in our cache, Detective.

18:03.009 --> 18:04.488
Please, don't.

18:05.087 --> 18:07.428
Did anyone else come
into contact with it

18:07.458 --> 18:09.487
- after you left?
- No.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.690
I suppose I was the last.

18:11.909 --> 18:14.338
Just what are you implying, sir?

18:14.413 --> 18:17.896
Because I'll remind you of
he to whom you are speaking!

18:18.021 --> 18:20.170
Yes... I'm well aware.

18:20.295 --> 18:22.967
I'm simply trying to
track the murder weapon.

18:23.588 --> 18:27.964
I didn't plant a bomb
in our star player's bat!

18:28.337 --> 18:32.540
I put it back in his stall
as I did with all the others.

18:33.968 --> 18:36.425
Do you know of anyone who may
have wished the count harm?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.624
Detective,

18:37.814 --> 18:41.637
we haven't won against the
professionals in seven years.

18:41.890 --> 18:45.099
Not only is the count the best
cricket player I've ever seen,

18:45.125 --> 18:47.668
he reaffirms the necessary divide

18:47.704 --> 18:51.009
between the honourable
proletariat and the beau monde!

18:51.067 --> 18:53.135
I'm captain of the team.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.787
If I knew of anyone who wished him harm,

18:54.810 --> 18:56.710
I would've come to you immediately.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.870
You saw no one else that evening?

18:59.335 --> 19:01.620
Actually, yes.

19:01.745 --> 19:04.533
Leonard Killjoy, a teammate.

19:04.567 --> 19:07.308
He wanted to talk
about my recent decision

19:07.346 --> 19:09.347
to replace him as opening bowler.

19:09.472 --> 19:10.928
Bumpy's a tad upset.

19:11.053 --> 19:14.352
And the count was the
one who replaced... Bumpy?

19:14.477 --> 19:16.236
Correct.

19:16.276 --> 19:18.741
Well, I was upset about
being replaced, yes.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.559
But I'd never fault a team for
putting their best players first.

19:21.856 --> 19:25.730
No, what bothered me most
was that the count lied to us.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.009
- How so?
- He's always going on

19:28.049 --> 19:32.055
about his big battle in Bulgaria.
It all just seemed so contrived.

19:32.180 --> 19:35.974
So I contacted a professor
friend at the university.

19:36.040 --> 19:39.205
Dagon Petrovitch never
fought in the Battle of Pirot.

19:39.269 --> 19:42.423
That was the famous
General Dragon Petrovitch.

19:42.452 --> 19:44.473
But how do you know the
count didn't fight as well?

19:44.496 --> 19:47.128
Well, because Dagon
Petrovitch was driving gypsies

19:47.173 --> 19:49.701
out of northern Serbia and
into Hungary at the time.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.514
Is there proof of this?

19:51.639 --> 19:53.898
Well, my professor friend
found a newspaper article

19:53.933 --> 19:56.973
in a British paper in the
archives. It should still be there.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.265
Where did you go after you
spoke to Dr. Newsome that night?

20:00.299 --> 20:02.229
I had dinner with a woman.

20:02.354 --> 20:05.470
- And after dinner?
- I mustn't say.

20:05.811 --> 20:10.074
We engaged in amorous
congress the entire evening.

20:10.630 --> 20:13.011
If we ask, she'll confirm this?

20:13.045 --> 20:17.030
- She most certainly will not.
- So our count's a liar.

20:17.155 --> 20:19.369
Quite common in those
circles, I'd imagine.

20:19.412 --> 20:21.404
That type are always
building themselves up

20:21.427 --> 20:22.625
to be something they're not.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.761
But it does raise some suspicions, sir.

20:24.789 --> 20:27.935
If he lied about that, what
else might he be lying about?

20:28.387 --> 20:30.762
You think he could be
the one to kill O'Donnell?

20:31.260 --> 20:34.979
Perhaps he learned of the plot to
steal his bat and sabotaged it first.

20:35.013 --> 20:38.013
Sirs? I checked on Mr. Killjoy's alibi.

20:38.047 --> 20:40.494
The woman he was with
corroborated his story.

20:41.219 --> 20:43.096
It was off-putting, sir.

20:43.488 --> 20:45.416
Have a look at this, Higgins.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.812
Your war hero.

20:50.355 --> 20:53.474
I don't understand. He
wasn't at the battle of Pirot?

20:54.496 --> 20:56.518
No, sir, he showed me his scars.

20:56.541 --> 20:58.038
He has battle scars?

20:58.055 --> 21:01.002
Yes, sir. Quite a deep one,
in fact. Right down here.

21:01.127 --> 21:04.395
Right here, you say.
How big is this scar?

21:04.870 --> 21:07.498
I'd say... like that.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.921
That's an appendectomy scar, Henry.

21:14.104 --> 21:17.508
This article clearly states that
you were hundreds of miles away

21:17.543 --> 21:20.292
flushing gypsy camps
out of norther Serbia.

21:20.333 --> 21:21.916
I've never seen this before.

21:21.974 --> 21:26.550
It says right there, "cousin of
the king's wife, Dagon Petrovitch."

21:26.608 --> 21:29.198
- That's you, is it not?
- Gentlemen...

21:29.722 --> 21:31.806
in the chaos of war,

21:31.931 --> 21:35.693
many facts are distorted or fabricated.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.709
Sometimes things take on
a mythology of their own.

21:40.384 --> 21:44.051
The chap who fought at Pirot
was named as Dragon Petrovitch,

21:44.176 --> 21:46.394
which means that you
got your own name wrong!

21:46.519 --> 21:50.090
So tell us, who are you? Really?

21:50.215 --> 21:54.163
- Besides a man without an appendix.
- What a surprise!

21:55.673 --> 21:57.838
- Hello, darling.
- Good evening, officers.

21:57.875 --> 22:00.215
- What's this about?
- These men are implying

22:00.265 --> 22:03.406
that I am some sort
of a liar or a fraud.

22:03.415 --> 22:05.018
Oh, you're not, Henry, are you?

22:05.051 --> 22:07.049
No. Not exactly.

22:07.754 --> 22:08.859
I'm not.

22:09.274 --> 22:10.449
They are.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.562
I'm afraid I must ask you to leave.

22:14.211 --> 22:17.799
This man is a victim, not a criminal,

22:17.868 --> 22:20.356
and the fact that you are questioning
him is frankly inexcusable!

22:20.388 --> 22:22.995
This man can't even remember
which battle he fought in!

22:23.041 --> 22:24.408
How dare you, sir?!

22:24.473 --> 22:26.735
Honestly, this is ridiculous!

22:26.767 --> 22:29.123
I have half a mind to
toss you out myself!

22:29.134 --> 22:31.354
- Dr. Newsome, please.
- Rupu, count to 10.

22:31.368 --> 22:33.091
The man is royalty, Ruthie!

22:33.132 --> 22:36.250
- This man is lying to you, Newsome!
- An inflammatory accusation, sir!

22:36.264 --> 22:39.115
- Oh, call it what you like!
- I refuse to listen to any more of this.

22:39.133 --> 22:40.458
Rupu, please! Oh!

22:40.921 --> 22:42.104
What is that?

22:42.146 --> 22:43.666
It's mine.

22:43.891 --> 22:46.631
I was bringing it upstairs
when these men arrived.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.100
- Oh.
- Oh! Allow me to assist you.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.071
- No, that's all right.
- No, please. I insist.

22:51.113 --> 22:53.088
- No, no, no, no!
- Truly, I just...

22:56.902 --> 22:58.150
That's not mine.

22:58.555 --> 23:00.260
You just said it was.

23:01.052 --> 23:02.314
The truth.

23:02.439 --> 23:03.659
For a change.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.117
I'm not a count.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.153
I'm Stan. Stanley Palazzo.

23:09.508 --> 23:11.289
- What?!
- What are you saying?

23:11.323 --> 23:13.500
What we've been trying to tell
you for the last five minutes!

23:13.528 --> 23:15.076
This man is an impostor!

23:15.122 --> 23:17.306
We opened our home to you!

23:17.329 --> 23:20.290
- Our home!
- Dr. Newsome, please sit down.

23:20.308 --> 23:21.358
I will not!

23:21.433 --> 23:24.006
This is an outrage!
And... and an affront!

23:24.020 --> 23:26.181
Oh, calm down, Newsome.
He'll get his comeuppance.

23:26.221 --> 23:29.294
- Henry, I don't feel so good...
- He must hang!

23:29.335 --> 23:30.422
Ruth?

23:30.532 --> 23:34.055
- I think I should probably sit down...
- Ruth?! Ruth?

23:38.508 --> 23:39.982
So, who are you really?

23:40.328 --> 23:43.036
I told you. I'm Stan
Palazzo. I'm from Oshawa.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.053
Oh, dear God! Oshawa!

23:45.077 --> 23:46.983
- Could it be worse?!
- Mr. Newsome, please...

23:47.006 --> 23:51.046
Dr. Newsome! And I will not be
silent for this... this... fabulist!

23:51.084 --> 23:53.731
- Just let me explain.
- She's coming to!

23:54.132 --> 23:57.168
- Are you all right, Fairy Face?
- Yes, I think so.

23:57.214 --> 23:59.275
What is he still doing here?!

23:59.303 --> 24:01.494
- You take him to jail!
- All right, enough!

24:01.528 --> 24:03.436
Doctor, sit down!

24:03.561 --> 24:04.587
- Count...
- Stanley.

24:04.631 --> 24:08.188
Stanley, sit! Miss Newsome, breathe.

24:08.437 --> 24:09.902
Now...

24:09.937 --> 24:12.271
just what was your plan, exactly?

24:12.812 --> 24:14.424
I didn't really have one.

24:14.447 --> 24:16.704
I met Ruth on the train
and I saw and obvious mark.

24:16.722 --> 24:17.942
What about your war medals?

24:17.965 --> 24:21.396
Russian, from a pawnshop
in Ronkonkoma, New York.

24:21.885 --> 24:24.486
And before I knew it, she
had invited me to stay here,

24:24.528 --> 24:26.554
and Rupert had made me
a member of the team.

24:26.679 --> 24:30.418
- I really didn't have to do much.
- We thought you were exiled royalty!

24:30.464 --> 24:32.831
- Sit down, Newsome!
- Hmph!

24:33.273 --> 24:35.194
But where did you learn
to play cricket like that?

24:35.228 --> 24:37.336
- Prison.
- Ruth!

24:37.368 --> 24:40.210
You gonzoogler!

24:40.242 --> 24:41.619
I should run you through!

24:41.637 --> 24:44.138
Oh, you were more than willing to
exploit me for my cricket skills.

24:44.148 --> 24:46.124
- You're no victim.
- Gentlemen!

24:46.156 --> 24:48.731
- Sit!
- And put the cutlery down!

24:49.309 --> 24:51.263
Hmm...

24:52.111 --> 24:54.095
Henry, is she all right?

24:54.138 --> 24:57.799
I think so, sir, but how much
more betrayal can one woman take?!

25:03.240 --> 25:05.580
So you were getting ready to run?

25:05.644 --> 25:07.871
What choice did I have?
Someone's trying to kill me!

25:10.772 --> 25:12.642
Been at this for some time, I take it?

25:13.687 --> 25:15.225
The confidence game?

25:15.837 --> 25:17.145
Yeah, long enough.

25:17.638 --> 25:20.806
I imagine you've accumulated
quite a list of enemies.

25:21.383 --> 25:22.748
I suppose.

25:22.789 --> 25:26.508
How did you learn about
the Serbian monarchy?

25:28.044 --> 25:30.813
I did some jobs with a Serbian grifter.

25:30.938 --> 25:32.885
Clearly he couldn't get
the names right either.

25:32.919 --> 25:36.804
Is it possible a member of the
Gentlemen's team recognized you?

25:36.827 --> 25:39.935
Had you had any dealings
with them prior to this?

25:40.060 --> 25:43.262
No. I wouldn't have
got involved if I had.

25:44.967 --> 25:46.562
Mr. Palazzo...

25:46.867 --> 25:49.402
who do you think planted the bomb?

25:50.373 --> 25:52.427
I honestly have no idea.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.821
A couple of days ago,

25:58.484 --> 26:00.280
I got this in my stall.

26:03.147 --> 26:05.945
- That's it?
- Yeah.

26:07.068 --> 26:09.631
And for the life of me, I
can't figure out what it means.

26:10.039 --> 26:12.358
Where were you in November of last year?

26:13.193 --> 26:14.860
In the Kingston jail.

26:16.694 --> 26:18.272
Detective, please.

26:19.766 --> 26:21.369
You gotta help me.

26:22.469 --> 26:24.420
Someone is out for revenge

26:24.483 --> 26:26.193
and with nowhere to stay,

26:26.318 --> 26:28.439
I'm a walking target.

26:29.573 --> 26:31.346
Mm-hmm.

26:37.265 --> 26:39.361
May I have a moment, Detective?

26:39.486 --> 26:40.858
Of course.

26:47.922 --> 26:51.774
I have never been this
upset in my entire life.

26:52.891 --> 26:55.465
Except, of course, when
you killed dear Roger.

26:58.404 --> 27:02.475
Might I suggest taking an
inventory of your possessions?

27:02.796 --> 27:06.876
- Some items may have been stolen.
- I'll have the servants look around.

27:09.581 --> 27:10.983
Detective...

27:11.108 --> 27:15.254
would it be possible to keep this quiet?

27:15.552 --> 27:18.407
I understand a crime has
been committed, but...

27:19.092 --> 27:23.197
if you could see a way
to... to be discreet?

27:23.640 --> 27:26.007
I promise to do what I can.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.833
If any of our friends found out,

27:27.873 --> 27:30.539
we would be laughed
straight out of Mimico.

27:31.322 --> 27:32.623
Of course.

27:33.555 --> 27:34.974
Thank you.

27:37.965 --> 27:40.279
We will weather this storm.

27:40.404 --> 27:44.049
The Newsomes are
nothing if not survivors.

27:46.209 --> 27:48.387
Except, of course, dear Roger.

27:49.467 --> 27:51.143
I have no doubt.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.192
Miss Newsome.

27:54.027 --> 27:55.680
Let's go, dear.

27:56.791 --> 27:58.956
- Henry?
- Hmm?

27:59.601 --> 28:02.031
Find out where the
Newsomes do their banking.

28:02.066 --> 28:03.233
Speak with the manager.

28:03.247 --> 28:05.983
It's possible Stanley gained
access to their accounts.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.570
Sir.

28:18.409 --> 28:19.924
Come in.

28:20.601 --> 28:22.310
I suppose the list
of suspects has grown,

28:22.319 --> 28:25.224
- what with this Palazzo being the target.
- Not necessarily.

28:25.258 --> 28:28.183
The only people who had access
were the Gentlemen themselves.

28:28.223 --> 28:31.388
The motive may have changed, but
the possible perpetrators haven't.

28:31.422 --> 28:34.088
We need to find out if Stanley
swindled any of them in the past.

28:34.134 --> 28:35.942
That's the most likely motive.

28:36.002 --> 28:37.611
Let's look into any connections.

28:37.658 --> 28:40.306
- A group that thick, there must be something.
- Sir.

28:44.105 --> 28:47.398
He's at a hotel with a
guard at the door. He's safe!

28:47.523 --> 28:49.791
- The cad.
- What if...

28:50.760 --> 28:53.085
what if the guard weren't there?

28:53.432 --> 28:55.721
Well, then he would be in real danger.

28:56.057 --> 28:57.790
Would that be so bad?

28:58.038 --> 29:00.628
Flitter Mouth, you can't
actually wish him...

29:02.453 --> 29:03.915
Can you?

29:04.571 --> 29:07.894
Well, I admit, I have
been daydreaming about it.

29:08.078 --> 29:10.560
Henry, our family has worked so hard

29:10.574 --> 29:12.747
to build our standing
in the community! First,

29:12.826 --> 29:14.608
the undercooked chicken
at the fundraiser...

29:15.014 --> 29:16.976
- and now, this!
- Bonbons,

29:17.174 --> 29:19.975
Detective Murdoch will assist
me in catching whoever did this.

29:20.864 --> 29:23.622
I'll make sure he never shows
his face in Toronto again. Just...

29:23.673 --> 29:25.117
please, don't kill him!

29:25.133 --> 29:27.961
Oh, you always know just what to say!

29:31.474 --> 29:32.801
Brewster!

29:32.985 --> 29:34.841
Take Miss Newsome home.

29:36.646 --> 29:39.546
I'll see you shortly, my wingless dove.

29:50.053 --> 29:52.118
Having second thoughts?

29:53.212 --> 29:56.192
Not that it would do me any
good at this point, but no,

29:56.207 --> 29:57.869
not a one.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.157
I've brought you something.

30:00.282 --> 30:02.402
Oh! What is it?

30:02.527 --> 30:05.230
Lavender oil. It's said to be soothing.

30:05.266 --> 30:07.173
Oh!

30:08.331 --> 30:10.462
Oh.

30:10.929 --> 30:13.053
It's... it's lovely.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.668
Perhaps a bit strong.

30:15.702 --> 30:18.162
- What do I do with it?
- Well, I...

30:18.219 --> 30:20.213
I thought you might know.

30:20.774 --> 30:23.108
Perhaps it should be diluted.

30:23.934 --> 30:25.546
Thank you.

30:31.511 --> 30:33.218
Right. I'm gonna let you off this time,

30:33.253 --> 30:35.016
but if it happens again,
I'm gonna tell your mother.

30:35.039 --> 30:37.118
You keep an eye on him. Off you go.

30:37.490 --> 30:38.730
Murdoch!

30:38.855 --> 30:41.897
We found a connection between the
count and one of the gentlemen.

30:41.931 --> 30:44.579
- Which one?
- The lothario, Leonard Killjoy.

30:44.648 --> 30:46.698
Apparently, Stanley
was involved in a scheme

30:46.738 --> 30:48.743
to relieve Killjoy's wife of a tidy sum.

30:48.758 --> 30:51.446
- Was he arrested for it?
- Not for that particular instance,

30:51.504 --> 30:54.157
but he was for a similar
swindle. He confessed to both.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.409
- So Mr. Killjoy knew the truth?
- Mm-hmm.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.610
Higgins said that he broke
up the man's marriage.

30:58.645 --> 31:00.761
- He's on his way in.
- Very good.

31:01.123 --> 31:03.415
- Well, she was an idiot.
- Your wife?

31:03.450 --> 31:04.779
Ex-wife.

31:04.969 --> 31:07.795
They convinced her she was
investing in a property development

31:07.801 --> 31:09.724
in the swamplands of Florida.

31:09.730 --> 31:12.073
Well, that must have been upsetting.

31:12.556 --> 31:15.100
I didn't marry her for
her brains, Detective.

31:15.169 --> 31:17.162
We divorced shortly after.

31:17.197 --> 31:19.698
But you never met the
man who swindled her?

31:19.889 --> 31:23.836
No, but according to her,
he was "quite charming."

31:23.870 --> 31:26.314
Yes. Mr. Killjoy, we
have reason to believe

31:26.351 --> 31:29.108
Stanley Palazzo is the
man who swindled your wife.

31:29.142 --> 31:31.987
- Who?
- Stanley Palazzo...

31:32.032 --> 31:35.187
the fraudster who has been
posing as Count Petrovitch?

31:35.205 --> 31:38.273
- Wait. Wait, so he's a...
- Confidence man.

31:40.473 --> 31:42.096
Oh, unbelievable!

31:42.136 --> 31:44.400
Oh, the Newsomes must be mortified!

31:44.440 --> 31:48.205
- Mr. Killjoy...
- Oh! Oh. I must tell everyone at the club.

31:48.217 --> 31:49.834
What did you say his name was?

31:49.863 --> 31:51.360
- Palazzo.
- Oh!

31:51.400 --> 31:54.911
And swindled by an
Italian to boot! Ha ha!

31:55.257 --> 31:58.437
How marvelous! Oh, boy!

31:58.671 --> 32:00.949
Higgins spoke to the
Newsomes' bank manager.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.118
It seems that Stanley did
try to make a withdrawal

32:03.133 --> 32:05.044
- from one of their accounts.
- I thought so.

32:05.078 --> 32:07.118
- How much did he steal?
- Not a penny.

32:07.152 --> 32:10.693
The bank manager became suspicious
and alerted Dr. Newsome personally.

32:10.716 --> 32:13.318
The transaction was canceled
and no further action was taken.

32:13.347 --> 32:16.052
- So Dr. Newsome knew about the attempt?
- It seems so.

32:16.098 --> 32:17.612
And yet he did nothing...

32:17.814 --> 32:20.985
- and made quite a show of being surprised.
- Hmm.

32:21.809 --> 32:24.163
Sir, my shift is ending soon.

32:24.197 --> 32:26.283
Do you think I might be
able to join the practice?

32:26.311 --> 32:29.495
I don't know, Henry. This
definitely takes precedence.

32:30.686 --> 32:33.225
This is Dr. Newsome's cabinet, sir.

32:43.259 --> 32:45.851
Maybe it's a surgical tool?

32:55.148 --> 32:56.996
What are you doing?!

32:57.651 --> 32:59.174
Dr. Newsome.

32:59.299 --> 33:01.209
We found these in your stall.

33:01.334 --> 33:02.573
What are those?

33:02.608 --> 33:06.005
Well, they appear to be the tool
used to hollow out a cricket bat

33:06.039 --> 33:09.605
- and a bottle of nitroglycerine.
- Nonsense! Those aren't mine.

33:10.549 --> 33:14.213
Dr. Newsome, you are under arrest
for the murder of Michael O'Donnell.

33:14.247 --> 33:16.348
Are you joking?!

33:17.286 --> 33:20.195
This is preposterous! Henry!

33:20.211 --> 33:23.432
Are you going to let him
do this to me?! Henry!

33:31.010 --> 33:33.722
I have no idea how
those got into my stall.

33:33.768 --> 33:36.519
For all I know, you put them there.

33:37.094 --> 33:38.885
Why did you not come to the police

33:38.915 --> 33:41.450
when you learned Stanley
wasn't who he claimed to be?

33:41.484 --> 33:43.933
Detective, please!

33:43.942 --> 33:47.189
I've told you how long we've been
losing to those professionals.

33:47.223 --> 33:49.051
I didn't care who he was!

33:49.074 --> 33:51.193
We needed him to win!

33:51.280 --> 33:53.527
I wasn't about to let
something as silly as money

33:53.531 --> 33:54.747
get in the way of that.

33:54.780 --> 33:58.271
So you abetted a charlatan in
order to win a cricket match?

33:58.920 --> 34:02.948
Well... of course when you say
it like that, it sounds absurd,

34:02.994 --> 34:05.579
but I was planning on
informing the police...

34:06.195 --> 34:07.952
after we won the game.

34:09.074 --> 34:10.879
How do you explain these?

34:12.056 --> 34:13.500
I suppose...

34:13.731 --> 34:15.350
I've been framed.

34:15.809 --> 34:17.351
You have to believe me!

34:17.387 --> 34:20.058
I'm a surgeon, not a murderer!

34:25.239 --> 34:28.630
- You certainly had motive.
- What motive?

34:28.664 --> 34:30.444
The attempted theft.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.672
The shame it would have
brought to your family,

34:32.695 --> 34:34.101
had the news gotten out.

34:34.137 --> 34:35.844
He needed to be silenced.

34:35.931 --> 34:37.304
Detective Murdoch,

34:37.507 --> 34:40.059
I am a member of the Mimico Newsomes.

34:40.081 --> 34:42.210
We do not murder people...

34:43.237 --> 34:44.715
that I know of.

34:47.358 --> 34:48.891
Does this mean anything to you?

34:48.918 --> 34:51.963
Hmm... November 26th.

34:52.226 --> 34:54.889
Ah, the birthday of Schmeltzer,

34:55.014 --> 34:56.790
my favourite composer.

35:01.972 --> 35:03.833
I'm sorry, Dr. Newsome,

35:03.851 --> 35:06.826
but given the evidence, I have
no choice but to charge you.

35:09.755 --> 35:13.018
- Put my bag in my stall, Brewster.
- Yes, sir.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.264
I hope you waxed your bat, Higgins.

35:17.307 --> 35:19.748
You don't have a hope in
hell without that ringer.

35:19.782 --> 35:22.818
Get ready for a pummeling.
This one's for Michael.

35:25.534 --> 35:27.986
I know we've been down
this road before with Roger,

35:28.044 --> 35:29.834
but I'm still flummoxed

35:29.864 --> 35:32.427
as to how dense the Newsomes can be.

35:32.462 --> 35:34.245
It is difficult to fathom.

35:35.230 --> 35:36.932
It can't be easy for Ruth, though,

35:36.966 --> 35:38.972
now with both brothers gone.

35:39.302 --> 35:41.315
At least she has Henry.

35:43.873 --> 35:46.197
Here's to a job well done, Detective.

35:48.033 --> 35:50.711
There is still the
matter of this note, sir.

35:52.477 --> 35:55.143
Dr. Newsome claims to
not know what it is.

35:55.218 --> 35:57.195
He also claims to be innocent.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.021
Maybe it's just more sledging
from the professionals.

36:00.538 --> 36:02.023
That's possible.

36:02.058 --> 36:03.958
Maybe someone slipped
it to him as a prank.

36:03.998 --> 36:06.338
Could even be some other
poor bugger that he swindled.

36:06.463 --> 36:09.829
No doubt we'll be investigating
Stanley's murder in the near future,

36:09.841 --> 36:12.501
but right now, it's got
nothing to do with this.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.369
I suppose you're right.

36:14.403 --> 36:16.214
I am right, Murdoch.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.781
I'm always right.... until I'm wrong.

36:19.149 --> 36:21.746
Rupert Newsome is our killer.

36:30.192 --> 36:31.718
Gentlemen...

36:32.138 --> 36:35.177
and I do not use that term lightly...

36:35.856 --> 36:37.848
a few words, if I may.

36:39.684 --> 36:42.275
Now, I know that many
of you must be thinking

36:42.298 --> 36:45.735
that we are doomed to fail
without the count, or...

36:45.781 --> 36:48.837
Stanley, or whoever that impostor was.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.805
And it is true:

36:51.256 --> 36:54.530
we have lost our captain
and our best player to...

36:54.576 --> 36:56.360
Murder and lies?

36:58.307 --> 37:00.304
Look at these men before you!

37:02.014 --> 37:04.403
This team is more than
just an individual!

37:05.100 --> 37:09.124
This team represents all that
is right and just in society!

37:10.127 --> 37:11.646
When I joined,

37:11.771 --> 37:13.728
I was a lowly commoner...

37:14.059 --> 37:16.247
and you accepted me as one of your own,

37:16.696 --> 37:18.166
and you welcomed me

37:18.200 --> 37:20.300
into your world.

37:22.649 --> 37:25.640
And now I am proud to
call myself one of you,

37:25.675 --> 37:27.294
win or lose.

37:27.985 --> 37:29.850
And win or lose,

37:30.109 --> 37:34.519
we will play with
dignity and with honour!

37:38.146 --> 37:39.955
What do you want?

37:43.339 --> 37:44.658
Forgiveness.

37:45.740 --> 37:48.146
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

37:48.271 --> 37:50.665
We do not play with thieves and liars.

37:52.193 --> 37:54.306
Are you ready to bowl?

37:55.538 --> 37:57.068
Yes, sir!

37:57.114 --> 37:59.366
Ha ha! Good to be back. He's back!

37:59.423 --> 38:02.020
Come on boys, come on! Here we go!

38:02.060 --> 38:04.006
That's it! That's it!

38:05.474 --> 38:07.581
Good to have you back!

38:07.604 --> 38:10.316
_

38:26.170 --> 38:28.439
- Sir!
- What is it, Murdoch?

38:29.354 --> 38:31.075
Have a look at this.

38:31.979 --> 38:34.943
- What am I looking at?
- November 26th.

38:34.977 --> 38:37.258
- And?
- Well, sir, do you think it's possible

38:37.276 --> 38:40.348
that whoever wrote this
was referring to this event?

38:40.383 --> 38:42.947
But it doesn't make sense.
Stanley isn't the count.

38:43.217 --> 38:45.312
Yes, but no one knew that.

38:45.595 --> 38:48.894
But you said someone from the
Gentlemen must have planted the bomb.

38:48.915 --> 38:51.465
Now you're theory's what?
That some gypsy wanted revenge?

38:51.517 --> 38:54.735
How many gypsies do you know that
are members of a posh cricket club?

38:54.810 --> 38:58.045
- There must be a connection.
- It doesn't bloody exist, Murdoch.

38:58.170 --> 39:01.218
We interviewed every player who
had access to that changing room.

39:02.795 --> 39:04.948
We interviewed every player

39:05.073 --> 39:06.750
but not every person.

39:07.637 --> 39:10.857
Brewster! Take Miss Newsome home.

39:15.928 --> 39:17.431
Henry's manservant.

39:17.887 --> 39:19.337
I'd like a word with him.

39:21.757 --> 39:23.413
That's it!

39:36.856 --> 39:39.262
Sir! Sir, are you all right?

39:39.498 --> 39:41.142
Someone hit me...

39:41.267 --> 39:44.437
- like a train.
- Who did this to you?

39:44.495 --> 39:46.101
Ah...

39:49.550 --> 39:52.529
You, there! Look after this man!

39:58.487 --> 39:59.840
What are you doing?

39:59.875 --> 40:02.200
Stop!

40:03.231 --> 40:06.190
- Don't come any closer.
- Brewster, what are you doing?

40:06.235 --> 40:08.124
- I insist you unhand...
- Quiet, you blithering idiot!

40:08.147 --> 40:10.581
My name is Baval. Did
you hear me, monster?

40:10.706 --> 40:12.351
Baval Salazar!

40:12.374 --> 40:15.730
I hear you and whatever I did,
I'm sorry! I can pay you back!

40:15.770 --> 40:17.700
There's no paying back
what you took from me.

40:17.723 --> 40:20.026
I was a child when you killed my parents

40:20.151 --> 40:22.133
You and your army of murderers!

40:22.156 --> 40:24.471
Mr. Salazar, listen to me.

40:24.505 --> 40:27.637
- This man is not who you think he is!
- It's true! I'm not!

40:27.660 --> 40:31.420
- Shut up!
- He's a fraud, an impostor, a petty thief!

40:31.437 --> 40:34.321
- Hey!
- His name is Stanley Palazzo.

40:34.373 --> 40:38.288
- He is not Dagon Petrovitch.
- It's true. Listen to his voice!

40:38.413 --> 40:39.923
I only pretended to be the count

40:39.952 --> 40:41.771
so that I could steal from the Newsomes!

40:41.800 --> 40:43.937
- I'm not even Serbian!
- You're a pig!

40:44.000 --> 40:45.382
- You'll say anything.
- No!

40:45.399 --> 40:46.936
I've been dreaming about this for years!

40:46.965 --> 40:48.951
- For all the pain...
- No!

40:55.608 --> 40:56.909
I'm bleeding.

40:57.034 --> 41:00.148
It's just a surface
wound. You'll be fine.

41:00.689 --> 41:03.534
- Good work, Henry.
- Thank you, sir.

41:03.758 --> 41:06.481
It's a good thing old
Ruth is as thick as she is.

41:19.377 --> 41:22.744
And I just love both
my brothers so dearly!

41:22.756 --> 41:24.650
Well, you can imagine my distress:

41:24.673 --> 41:28.691
one barely in the grave and
then the other one in jail!

41:30.649 --> 41:33.925
- Rupu!
- Ruthie-schmuthie!

41:34.369 --> 41:36.459
I am so glad you're all right!

41:36.488 --> 41:40.091
- Did Henry tell you how heroic he was?
- In some detail, yes.

41:40.109 --> 41:41.456
You should be proud!

41:41.479 --> 41:45.141
You should have seen it. He was
magnificent! Just like a lion with a bat!

41:46.116 --> 41:48.937
Well, I suppose the
real work begins now:

41:48.960 --> 41:50.613
trying to find a quality manservant.

41:52.335 --> 41:55.840
- Dr. Newsome.
- Ah, Detective.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.973
I hope there are no hard feelings.

41:58.023 --> 42:00.790
Henry told me you worked
to prove my innocence.

42:00.915 --> 42:02.941
For that, I am grateful.

42:03.268 --> 42:04.732
Perhaps, one day...

42:05.612 --> 42:07.924
I may even forgive you
for killing my brother.

42:08.518 --> 42:09.711
Perhaps.

42:10.333 --> 42:11.959
I'll see you soon.

42:12.512 --> 42:13.981
My hero.

42:14.313 --> 42:15.520
Gentlemen.

42:19.904 --> 42:22.262
Can you believe a family as fine as that

42:22.289 --> 42:24.399
has taken me on as one of their own?

42:31.257 --> 42:32.537
If it's a boy,

42:32.616 --> 42:35.536
perhaps the inspector could
teach him to play cricket.

42:36.384 --> 42:39.152
There's nothing that says
that girls can't play as well.

42:39.732 --> 42:42.551
- True.
- Well, these are modern times, William.

42:43.256 --> 42:45.904
I imagine we'll have to
start looking for a house.

42:46.029 --> 42:49.482
- Something bigger.
- I'm perfectly happy in the hotel.

42:49.741 --> 42:53.582
Yes, but something with
more room, perhaps a yard.

42:53.656 --> 42:56.673
Well, I suppose I
could try to cook more.

42:57.191 --> 43:00.599
But then again, parks
do offer plenty of space.

43:00.663 --> 43:03.168
You said you liked
my stew and dumplings.

43:03.202 --> 43:05.396
Mmm...

43:06.409 --> 43:08.908
We should start interviewing au pairs.

43:09.259 --> 43:10.883
William...

43:11.073 --> 43:13.393
That may be a bit prematured.

43:14.459 --> 43:18.967
- I've begun a list of potential schools...
- Oh, I am sure you have.

43:20.170 --> 43:23.964
And I'm sure you'll make many many more.

43:27.275 --> 43:28.754
How are you feeling?

43:30.568 --> 43:32.451
I've never been better.

43:34.189 --> 43:36.135
Neither have I, Julia.
