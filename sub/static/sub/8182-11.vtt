01:37.883 --> 01:39.184
Hey!

01:41.159 --> 01:42.926
Oh.

01:44.186 --> 01:46.336
Hello.

01:46.396 --> 01:48.514
What the hell
is that?!

01:48.575 --> 01:49.291
Warden moved out,

01:49.356 --> 01:50.907
Finally got my scooter.

01:50.969 --> 01:52.036
Good for you, doug.

01:52.099 --> 01:53.266
On your own a week

01:53.330 --> 01:55.331
And you've already given up
cleaning and walking.

01:57.287 --> 01:58.555
So you finally decided
to come home.

01:58.617 --> 02:01.053
No. I just came
to get some stuff.

02:01.112 --> 02:03.513
And by the way,
my home is in manhattan now.

02:03.573 --> 02:05.041
And you're welcome
to join me.

02:05.103 --> 02:06.270
Well, you know
what you might want to do?

02:06.332 --> 02:07.216
You might want
to open a window

02:07.281 --> 02:08.430
And check
the temperature,

02:08.494 --> 02:10.029
Because it's going
to be a cold day in hell

02:10.091 --> 02:11.324
Before that happens.

02:11.387 --> 02:13.389
Trust me, i'm all
for opening up a window.

02:13.449 --> 02:14.816
Ooooooh.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.880
I get it!

02:17.773 --> 02:22.177
You're gone. I'm all
by myself and i "smell."

02:22.229 --> 02:24.097
Ok, where are you going?

02:24.159 --> 02:25.475
To get the china.

02:25.538 --> 02:27.222
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

02:27.284 --> 02:29.185
My house, my china.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.193
What do you
need the china for?

02:32.255 --> 02:33.922
You having a dinner party?

02:33.984 --> 02:34.767
I'll have
a dinner party.

02:34.915 --> 02:36.232
I'll have a dinner
party right now!

02:37.709 --> 02:38.643
You didn't even
know we had china

02:38.707 --> 02:39.707
Until i said something.

02:39.771 --> 02:40.937
I know we have china.

02:41.001 --> 02:42.118
Ok. I love our china!

02:42.181 --> 02:42.898
Oh, you love our china?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.246
Well, what's the pattern?

02:44.310 --> 02:46.695
Um... gay!

02:46.755 --> 02:48.822
Yeah.

02:48.882 --> 02:49.582
Just stop!
You're being an idiot.

02:49.648 --> 02:51.132
No!

02:56.331 --> 02:57.848
You know what?

02:57.911 --> 03:01.814
10 years of that, it's
nothing but scar tissue now.

03:01.869 --> 03:03.086
Well, fine. If that's the
way you want to play it.

03:03.149 --> 03:04.349
I'll just get
some new china.

03:04.412 --> 03:06.029
Oh, yeah?
Well, good luck!

03:06.059 --> 03:08.444
Because i already
maxed out the credit cards

03:08.504 --> 03:10.755
Reto-Fitting the suv
for this baby!

03:10.815 --> 03:13.383
Yeah!

03:15.769 --> 03:18.304
That's funny. Yeah.

03:20.060 --> 03:22.677
What the hell?
Holy...

03:22.736 --> 03:23.936
You've been robbed!

03:23.999 --> 03:25.049
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait.

03:25.114 --> 03:26.081
What if-What if they're
still in the house?

03:26.144 --> 03:27.512
I mean...
i can't die tonight.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.742
I'm wearing
very girlish underwear.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.281
Hi, baby. Just to let you know,

03:33.345 --> 03:35.646
I stopped by
and grabbed a few things.

03:35.706 --> 03:38.073
But don't worry,
i left the china.

03:38.133 --> 03:40.067
Enjoy your dinner party.

03:41.210 --> 03:42.376
This is all your fault!

03:42.439 --> 03:43.622
You know, for making
us bowl 2 extra frames!

03:43.686 --> 03:44.954
We could've stopped her!

03:45.017 --> 03:46.718
It's the only sport
i'm good at!

03:46.780 --> 03:48.096
You had them
put up the bumpers!

03:48.159 --> 03:49.793
I hardly used them.

03:51.485 --> 03:52.385
You know what? Why don't
we just go to cooper's

03:52.449 --> 03:54.117
And watch
the hockey game there?

03:54.179 --> 03:55.929
We do that
and she wins!

03:55.991 --> 03:58.326
Well, she is good.

03:58.386 --> 04:00.136
Hey!

04:00.198 --> 04:01.699
Fine! You know what?

04:01.762 --> 04:02.895
I don't need you guys!

04:02.958 --> 04:03.925
I don't need her!

04:03.989 --> 04:05.222
I don't need anybody!

04:05.286 --> 04:06.904
I was going to
make you panini, too!

04:06.965 --> 04:09.400
You know what?
More panini for me!

04:13.317 --> 04:15.852
Afanasenkov takes
the puck in the corner.

04:15.911 --> 04:17.779
Centers it
to ponikarovsky.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.475
Ponikarovsky passes
it back to afanasenkov.

04:20.531 --> 04:21.531
And a whistle...

04:21.596 --> 04:22.998
High-Sticking.

04:30.543 --> 04:31.610
Hello.

04:31.673 --> 04:32.640
Dougie!

04:32.705 --> 04:34.306
Oh! Hey, mom.
What's up?

04:34.367 --> 04:35.568
Thank god you answered!

04:35.631 --> 04:37.932
I've been trying
to reach you for days.

04:37.992 --> 04:39.042
I wanted to tell
you and carrie

04:39.106 --> 04:40.306
That we're flying in.

04:40.370 --> 04:43.722
I had a companion ticket
that was about to expire.

04:43.778 --> 04:45.696
Anyway, we just landed.

04:45.758 --> 04:47.091
What?!

04:47.154 --> 04:49.455
We should be there in
2 shakes of a lamb's tail.

05:03.016 --> 05:05.501
Mom! Dad! Hey!

05:05.560 --> 05:07.612
Come have some
cheese and crackers.

05:07.672 --> 05:09.523
Where the hell's
all your furniture?

05:09.585 --> 05:11.902
Oh, uh...

05:11.962 --> 05:14.764
W- We're having
it refurbished.

05:14.821 --> 05:16.039
All of it?

05:16.102 --> 05:17.536
Yeah, you know. It's taking
a long time, though, because...

05:17.599 --> 05:18.966
I've got to be honest,

05:19.029 --> 05:21.280
I don't even know how they
furbish it in the first place.

05:21.340 --> 05:22.373
Where's carrie?

05:22.437 --> 05:24.287
Oh, carrie.
Um...

05:24.349 --> 05:26.000
Bridge.

05:26.062 --> 05:27.228
She plays bridge?

05:27.292 --> 05:30.194
No, she's
on the bridge.

05:30.252 --> 05:32.286
Queensboro,
she's cleaning it.

05:32.348 --> 05:34.682
It's a community service
thing. It's court ordered.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.855
What's going
on here, doug?

05:41.060 --> 05:42.594
Here's the thing,
uh...

05:42.657 --> 05:44.024
Carrie, uh...

05:44.086 --> 05:46.321
She's just got a little
apartment in the city,

05:46.381 --> 05:49.249
And, uh... i'm kind of staying
here by myself right now.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.308
It's all good!

05:51.369 --> 05:54.037
You're separated?
Oh, my god.

05:54.095 --> 05:55.229
No, no, no.
We're not separated.

05:55.293 --> 05:57.094
We're just kind of shaking
things up a little bit.

05:57.155 --> 05:58.289
You know... separately!

05:59.450 --> 06:01.518
I need water.

06:07.647 --> 06:10.216
Hey, you were right.

06:10.275 --> 06:12.226
This seafoam green
really pops!

06:12.286 --> 06:13.954
I told you!

06:14.016 --> 06:15.049
Listen, i want
to thank you

06:15.113 --> 06:16.647
For keeping doug
at the bowling alley.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.244
I never could have gotten
the furniture without you.

06:19.303 --> 06:21.520
Hey, it was not easy.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.316
I had to tell him that
i needed the bumpers.

06:24.374 --> 06:26.942
I don't!

06:27.002 --> 06:29.637
Listen, uh, i know you
and doug are friends and-

06:29.695 --> 06:30.995
Yeah.

06:31.059 --> 06:34.595
You guys are all about
"bros before hos," but...

06:36.712 --> 06:38.996
This ho really
appreciates it.

06:39.056 --> 06:40.674
Thanks.

06:46.805 --> 06:48.956
The cotton is soft.

06:55.368 --> 06:57.102
Ok, well...

06:57.164 --> 06:59.999
3 cans of comet later,
the kitchen is presentable.

07:00.057 --> 07:01.357
I'm going to go
upstairs and see

07:01.420 --> 07:04.689
If the oven cleaner took
care of that toilet situation.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.374
It's open!

07:09.135 --> 07:10.519
Hey!

07:10.582 --> 07:11.733
Look who's here!

07:11.796 --> 07:13.263
Hi.
Hi!

07:13.326 --> 07:16.128
Dougie! You remember your
second cousin virginia?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.387
Oh, yeah.

07:18.447 --> 07:19.064
We played mouse trap

07:19.129 --> 07:20.546
At uncle freddy's funeral.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.125
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure.

07:22.188 --> 07:23.888
Anyway, i'll
put on some coffee,

07:23.950 --> 07:26.068
While you kids catch up.

07:34.575 --> 07:37.093
Well, the toilet's
bubbling.

07:37.153 --> 07:39.988
I think that's
a good sign.

07:40.046 --> 07:41.831
Aren't you howard
and judy's daughter?

07:41.892 --> 07:43.660
I put bailey's
in the coffee!

07:43.721 --> 07:46.774
Get this party started, as the kids say.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.565
Joe, could i talk
to you in the kitchen?

07:52.118 --> 07:53.718
What the "h" "e"
double hockey sticks

07:53.780 --> 07:54.914
Are you doing?

07:54.977 --> 07:56.412
Oh, open your eyes!

07:56.475 --> 07:57.741
Their marriage is over.

07:57.804 --> 07:58.804
We don't find him somebody,

07:58.869 --> 08:00.336
He's going to move
back in with us.

08:01.695 --> 08:03.045
So you set him up
with his cousin?!

08:03.109 --> 08:05.477
What do you want?
A 3 headed grandchild?

08:05.535 --> 08:07.203
They can adopt!

08:07.265 --> 08:08.432
Like that madonna-

08:08.496 --> 08:10.647
Will you stop it!

08:10.707 --> 08:11.790
Look, carrie and i
are going to deal

08:11.854 --> 08:14.256
With our own problems
by ourselves, ok?

08:14.315 --> 08:15.882
You're darn tootin'
you will.

08:15.944 --> 08:16.961
You know what
you're going to do?

08:17.026 --> 08:19.394
You and carrie are going
to go talk to father biskup.

08:19.453 --> 08:20.988
He'll straighten
you out.

08:21.049 --> 08:22.116
Mom, i-I'm-

08:22.181 --> 08:23.764
Don't you mom me!

08:23.826 --> 08:25.127
You are going, mister.

08:27.784 --> 08:30.135
Hey! Thanks for
painting the bedroom.

08:30.195 --> 08:31.078
And that mural
in the bathroom

08:31.142 --> 08:32.458
Is amazing.

08:32.522 --> 08:33.756
Oh, you-You like it?

08:33.818 --> 08:36.671
I love it! You made me
look really busty.

08:36.730 --> 08:41.049
Well, um... i'm going to go
out and pick up some more paint

08:41.102 --> 08:43.888
And... maybe something for
the top of your curio shelf.

08:43.945 --> 08:45.263
What curio shelf?

08:45.326 --> 08:47.210
The one i bought you
at the great indoors.

08:47.270 --> 08:48.438
Aww, you're the best.

09:02.468 --> 09:04.719
You're not taking
the furniture back!

09:04.779 --> 09:05.746
Don't want it.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.245
Just open the door.

09:07.307 --> 09:09.275
I just want
to talk to you.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.193
Wipe your wheels.

09:14.258 --> 09:16.026
They're clean.

09:18.049 --> 09:19.516
So, this is it, huh?

09:19.578 --> 09:22.680
Yep. This is the place
you promised you'd live.

09:28.008 --> 09:30.276
Why is there a picture of
joan collins on your wall?

09:30.336 --> 09:32.905
Ok.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.564
If you're not here
to tell me you're moving in,

09:34.626 --> 09:36.594
I got things i gotta do.

09:36.654 --> 09:38.038
Ok, here's the deal.

09:41.244 --> 09:45.230
My mom found out about us
bein'... whatever we are.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.552
All right, and she says she's not
going to go back down to florida

09:47.612 --> 09:49.346
Unless we go see
father biskup.

09:49.408 --> 09:52.026
And this is my problem
because...

09:52.084 --> 09:53.785
Because she's right
downstairs in the car.

09:53.848 --> 09:55.748
What?!

09:55.809 --> 09:57.177
Crap!

09:57.239 --> 09:58.990
And as soon as i
press this button,

09:59.052 --> 10:02.988
Her giant, old lady cell
phone is going to ring,

10:03.043 --> 10:06.412
And as soon as she figures
out how to answer it,

10:06.468 --> 10:08.902
She's going
to be up here, carrie.

10:08.962 --> 10:11.147
So, you
gotta ask yourself.

10:11.206 --> 10:12.723
What's it gonna be?

10:12.786 --> 10:15.705
All right!
We'll see father biskup.

10:15.762 --> 10:17.297
Good.

10:17.359 --> 10:18.325
But just to be clear,

10:18.389 --> 10:20.357
It's only to get your
mother off our backs, right?

10:20.417 --> 10:21.385
We're just going
through the motions.

10:21.449 --> 10:22.849
Deal.
Deal.

10:22.912 --> 10:24.513
Oh...

10:24.575 --> 10:26.442
And i'm taking back
the panini grill.

10:26.504 --> 10:27.137
No, you are not
taking back the-

10:27.201 --> 10:29.437
Eeeeeee.
Fine! Fine!

10:49.349 --> 10:52.218
Where the hell
were you?

10:52.276 --> 10:54.477
I waited outside the
podiatrist's office for 2 hours.

10:54.538 --> 10:56.805
Sorry, i got
caught up.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.583
What the hell is that?

10:58.645 --> 11:00.512
It's a little, uh,
somethin' somethin'

11:00.573 --> 11:04.376
For a pretty special lady. Who?

11:04.431 --> 11:07.933
I can't say,
it's complicated.

11:07.989 --> 11:10.190
God, you're annoying.

11:10.251 --> 11:11.884
What's your problem?

11:11.946 --> 11:13.047
I've had a rough
afternoon, all right?

11:13.111 --> 11:16.113
You know, i sat with you,
when you had your corn shaved.

11:16.170 --> 11:20.741
Look, things are moving pretty
fast between me and ms. X.

11:20.792 --> 11:23.861
And we may be taking our
relationship to the next level.

11:23.919 --> 11:25.636
What do you mean?

11:25.698 --> 11:27.248
I may be moving out.

11:27.310 --> 11:29.544
I'm sorry i couldn't
give you anymore notice.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.740
Don't be sorry. Roommates
are a dime a dozen.

11:32.797 --> 11:34.365
But know this,

11:34.427 --> 11:36.211
You walk out that door,
you're dead to me.

11:36.273 --> 11:37.873
I'm like an assassin.

11:37.935 --> 11:39.637
I never look back.

11:39.698 --> 11:42.366
Well, it was, uh,
good being your roommate.

11:42.425 --> 11:44.025
And uh, you know
i- I gotta...

11:44.087 --> 11:46.855
A lot of stuff to do. So
i'll, uh... see you later.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.132
Yeah, whatever.
Take it easy.

11:56.990 --> 12:01.261
Doug, carrie, welcome.

12:01.313 --> 12:03.481
Now, i understand,
from doug's mother

12:03.542 --> 12:06.210
That you two have hit a little
rough patch in your relationship.

12:07.682 --> 12:08.799
Well, in my experience,

12:08.863 --> 12:12.065
No matter how difficult
things may seem at the moment,

12:12.122 --> 12:13.889
There's usually an answer.

12:13.951 --> 12:16.418
Sometimes, where you
least expect it.

12:16.477 --> 12:19.079
Well, you've been very helpful. Yeah.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.238
Thank you so much.

12:20.302 --> 12:21.568
Wait, wait, wait.

12:21.632 --> 12:24.001
Doug, carrie,
i'm not quite done.

12:26.321 --> 12:28.923
Now, carrie,
i understand your father

12:28.981 --> 12:31.582
Has moved out
to get married.

12:31.641 --> 12:32.975
Yeah.

12:33.039 --> 12:34.890
Well, sometimes
the departure

12:34.951 --> 12:36.484
Of a family member
from the household

12:36.548 --> 12:39.182
Creates a void
in your life.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.958
That's a lot
to chew on.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.988
Yeah.

12:43.048 --> 12:45.817
Void where prohibited.
Ok, thank you very much.

12:45.874 --> 12:48.309
You know,
i moved back a baptism

12:48.369 --> 12:50.336
To make time
for you two today.

12:50.397 --> 12:52.932
I thought you were here
for spiritual guidance.

12:54.422 --> 12:57.690
Well, the truth is,
father, um...

12:57.748 --> 12:59.915
We were going for more

12:59.975 --> 13:02.443
Of the appearance
of spiritual guidance.

13:02.502 --> 13:03.236
Pardon me?

13:03.368 --> 13:05.686
Uh, the thing is,
father, uh...

13:05.746 --> 13:08.414
We're going to take care
of our problem by ourselves,

13:08.473 --> 13:10.774
But uh, we came to you
because, uh...

13:10.833 --> 13:13.034
Well, we'd like you
to get my mom off our backs.

13:13.094 --> 13:14.545
Oh, how wonderful.

13:14.607 --> 13:18.377
And what can i do to help
you deceive your mother?

13:18.432 --> 13:21.784
Oh! I mean, she's
in the car right now.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.475
So, uh, maybe you
could, uh,

13:24.534 --> 13:26.735
I don't know,
i'm just spitballin' here,

13:26.795 --> 13:28.630
Uh, walk us out with your arms
around us? Or something like that.

13:28.691 --> 13:29.791
Yes! Yes!

13:29.855 --> 13:31.122
With a look on your face

13:31.184 --> 13:32.619
Like "i did the best i can
do." You know what i mean?

13:32.681 --> 13:33.981
Yeah, that would be great.

13:34.045 --> 13:37.164
I don't want to do
your job for you.

13:37.221 --> 13:39.422
All right. If we're going to do this,

13:39.482 --> 13:40.816
Let's get it over with.

13:40.879 --> 13:42.246
All right!
Thank you, father!

13:42.309 --> 13:43.876
You're a lifesaver.
Absolutely.

13:43.937 --> 13:45.238
Hey, don't be surprised if
there's a little something extra

13:45.302 --> 13:47.103
In your, uh,
collection plate on sunday.

13:47.165 --> 13:48.431
You know what i'm saying?

13:50.107 --> 13:53.026
I'll see you on sunday though.

13:54.214 --> 13:55.915
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

13:55.977 --> 13:56.944
Just be another minute.

13:57.007 --> 13:58.107
Oh, that's ok, father.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.239
Oh! Hi, suzy!
Hey, carrie!

14:00.299 --> 14:01.700
I work with her.
How are you?

14:01.763 --> 14:04.865
Good! Look at you, you lost
the baby weight already.

14:04.923 --> 14:06.122
I know,
and here it is!

14:06.186 --> 14:08.254
Aw, let me see.
What's his name?

14:08.313 --> 14:10.498
He's cute.
Aww!

14:10.559 --> 14:12.760
You know,
i just remembered,

14:12.820 --> 14:14.104
Uh, russ, suzanna?

14:14.167 --> 14:17.002
I need you inside to sign
a few more baptism papers.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.928
Right now? I was
about to feed the baby.

14:18.989 --> 14:21.758
Oh, i'm sure carrie
would be happy to do it.

14:21.815 --> 14:23.282
You don't mind,
do you?

14:23.345 --> 14:24.879
We'll be right
in here if you need us.

14:24.942 --> 14:26.292
Sure, go ahead!

14:26.355 --> 14:27.655
All right.
Thank you.

14:27.718 --> 14:30.019
Yeah, no problem.

14:30.079 --> 14:33.832
Uh, father b, he's a...
he's a good egg, isn't he?

14:33.888 --> 14:36.022
Yeah, he just likes to hear
himself talk though, right?

14:36.081 --> 14:38.449
I know. What was with
that whole void thing?

14:38.510 --> 14:40.978
I know.
Like what void?

14:45.759 --> 14:49.029
What? You d
- You don't think the baby's our void.

14:49.084 --> 14:50.985
Do you, doug?

14:51.047 --> 14:52.881
I mean, we've
been down this road.

14:52.943 --> 14:55.678
I
- I... we tried to get pregnant. We can't.

14:55.735 --> 14:59.138
Yeah, but, you know,
we could adopt.

14:59.195 --> 15:00.395
My father said that

15:00.457 --> 15:03.493
When he tried to set me
up with my second cousin.

15:04.848 --> 15:07.082
Look, i never stopped
wanting to have a baby, ok?

15:07.142 --> 15:08.242
What about you?

15:08.306 --> 15:11.058
Are you kidding me?
I'll take this one!

15:11.116 --> 15:14.118
He's already wrapped and fed.
Let's get out of here.

15:16.038 --> 15:17.338
What are
we talking about?

15:17.400 --> 15:20.169
We can't adopt. We're not
even living in the same place.

15:22.206 --> 15:23.640
But we could be.

15:23.703 --> 15:25.870
Oh, and i guess
you're thinking

15:25.931 --> 15:27.732
That i'm the one who
should give in, right?

15:27.793 --> 15:30.428
I'm just saying, look,
you know, i mean a baby...

15:30.487 --> 15:33.922
Should have a yard where
there's fresh air, and you know.

15:33.979 --> 15:36.264
Uh, it can't get fresh
air on a fire escape?

15:40.763 --> 15:42.898
Fine.

15:42.957 --> 15:46.693
I'll give up
the apartment.

15:46.749 --> 15:49.884
But you know,
if we adopt a baby,

15:49.941 --> 15:51.242
I'm going to have to
quit my job for a while.

15:51.304 --> 15:52.371
You know what
that means, right?

15:52.436 --> 15:55.687
Um, yeah, you're
going to be around a lot.

15:57.507 --> 15:59.375
No, it means you're
going to have to get a job

15:59.435 --> 16:01.036
That pays a lot more.
Oh, come on carrie.

16:01.099 --> 16:02.733
We're not going to go into
this stupid sales thing again.

16:02.794 --> 16:06.630
Doug, your uncle said you could
make double what you're making now.

16:06.685 --> 16:09.070
It's just that
i've been at i.P.S...

16:09.130 --> 16:10.797
Longer than anybody
without a promotion.

16:10.859 --> 16:13.995
I mean, i'm right
where i want to be.

16:14.051 --> 16:15.585
Look, i know it's scary.

16:15.648 --> 16:18.316
But we're both taking
a leap of faith here.

16:18.373 --> 16:20.642
So let me just
get this straight.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.034
You're going to
get rid of the apartment,

16:24.094 --> 16:26.495
I'm going to get a new job,

16:26.555 --> 16:29.824
And we're both
going to get a baby.

16:29.881 --> 16:33.583
That's the deal
that's on the table.

16:33.637 --> 16:35.405
I'm in.

16:36.631 --> 16:38.232
Me too.

16:43.166 --> 16:47.469
Ok, um...
i'm not pointing fingers,

16:47.523 --> 16:50.492
But someone
peed on my hand.

16:55.221 --> 16:56.187
Hey, babe.

16:56.251 --> 16:57.218
Hey.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.383
Where's the scooter?

16:58.446 --> 17:00.280
Totaled it.

17:03.268 --> 17:06.103
By the way,
our mailman's suing us.

17:06.161 --> 17:09.329
So, all
the paperwork in?

17:09.387 --> 17:10.670
Yep, once they
give us the green light,

17:10.734 --> 17:14.502
We hop on a plane to china, and
14 hours later, we're parents.

17:15.888 --> 17:19.156
Hey, i won't even have
to gain the 60 pounds.

17:19.214 --> 17:22.349
Yeah, i can't
make that promise.

17:22.406 --> 17:25.641
So, how you, uh, doing
giving up this place, huh?

17:25.698 --> 17:26.965
I'm fine.

17:27.030 --> 17:28.997
You know, we're both
making sacrifices.

17:29.058 --> 17:30.758
Yeah. Oh, hey.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.354
You want me to drop
these off with the super?

17:32.417 --> 17:33.267
Ah, no.
I'll do it tonight.

17:33.331 --> 17:34.748
Ok.

17:34.811 --> 17:38.530
Hey, since this is your
last night in manhattan,

17:38.585 --> 17:39.585
You want to, uh...

17:39.649 --> 17:43.518
Enjoy a new york minute?

17:45.402 --> 17:47.737
Uh, sure.

17:47.797 --> 17:50.481
Should we roll out
the bubble wrap?

17:50.540 --> 17:51.741
I don't think so.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.906
Once i get going, it's going
to sound like a gun fight.

18:19.323 --> 18:22.824
Hey, mike. Good job
on the raymond-Jack account.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.613
Thanks.

18:23.678 --> 18:25.496
Yeah!

18:28.450 --> 18:30.551
Hey, doug! So how's
your first week going?

18:30.612 --> 18:31.712
Great so far.

18:31.776 --> 18:33.043
I mean, everyone's
been really nice,

18:33.106 --> 18:34.907
And gary invited me
to lunch at chili's.

18:34.968 --> 18:36.702
Oh, yeah?
Stay away from gary.

18:36.764 --> 18:37.965
He'll pretend
to be your friend

18:38.028 --> 18:39.295
And then bad-Mouth
you to everyone.

18:39.359 --> 18:43.695
Actually, i was pretty
psyched about going to chili's.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.683
Hey, it's your funeral.

18:45.743 --> 18:47.844
Personally,
i'd fire the douche.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.105
But he's my top salesman.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.636
So, uh, anyway,
how you doin' doug?

18:50.698 --> 18:52.266
You sell any
office furniture today?

18:52.328 --> 18:54.212
Well, yeah, i-I
might have a few leads.

18:54.274 --> 18:57.476
A c.P.A. In paramus
might want to buy a chair.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.685
Ok, i don't want to hear
about "a guy" and "a chair,"

19:00.741 --> 19:04.144
I want to hear about a
floor, a division, a company!

19:04.199 --> 19:05.867
This is a commission
business, doug.

19:05.929 --> 19:08.363
You wanna make money?
Huh? Gary money?

19:08.423 --> 19:11.976
You get out there,
and you sell chairs!

19:12.031 --> 19:13.131
Capeesh?

19:13.195 --> 19:15.363
Yes. Yes, sir.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.889
Dinelli office furnishings, first
in lumbar support. Doug heffernan.

19:27.943 --> 19:29.010
Have you checked

19:29.075 --> 19:32.544
Your apartment in manhattan?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.000
Who-Who is this?

19:34.063 --> 19:36.964
Just check your apartment.

19:37.022 --> 19:38.423
Ok, we got rid
of our apart-

19:38.486 --> 19:40.387
Who-Who-Who
