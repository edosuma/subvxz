WEBVTT

00:29.396 --> 00:30.729
Walter!

00:31.798 --> 00:34.066
(woman screaming)

00:37.237 --> 00:39.038
Breaching... Go!

00:40.140 --> 00:42.808
Immunity agreement
and extradition waiver.

00:42.810 --> 00:47.079
Sign them, and I'll tell you
how I hacked into nasa.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.382
Corporal to command.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.750
We have scorpion.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.819
He's just a kid.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.821
Officer (over radio):
Team leaders maintain position

00:55.823 --> 00:58.123
To leave...

00:58.125 --> 00:59.725
Target is acquired.

01:02.595 --> 01:06.231
I just wanted the shuttle
blueprints for my wall.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.067
(crying)

01:32.492 --> 01:35.194
What's your name, son?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.262
Woman:
<i>Walter?</i>

01:39.632 --> 01:42.234
Walter?

01:42.236 --> 01:44.103
Are you listening?

01:44.105 --> 01:46.438
Yes, you said "I didn't see
this coming at all."

01:46.440 --> 01:48.240
I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.876
I'll admit you
have been patient.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.678
Longest three months of my life.
Mmm.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.146
You're not easy, walter.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.380
I thought this might help.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.449
Throughout our relationship,

01:57.451 --> 02:00.152
You've accused me,
correctly, of being unable

02:00.154 --> 02:02.688
To connect with your
emotional states.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.557
So... I mapped out

02:05.559 --> 02:07.860
What I anticipate
you'll experience

02:07.862 --> 02:09.394
Over the next few minutes.

02:09.396 --> 02:12.264
You wrote a document
to connect with me

02:12.266 --> 02:13.298
Emotionally?
Mm-hmm.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.700
Now, this is a decision tree.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.201
This is just to help
you through the...

02:16.203 --> 02:17.236
Man:
Hey! I pay you

02:17.238 --> 02:18.670
To fix wireless, not talk.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.207
You scheduled
our breakup on a job?!

02:22.209 --> 02:24.209
To be more efficient.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.911
You may be trying, walter.

02:25.913 --> 02:29.681
But you're still
a million miles from normal.

02:36.389 --> 02:37.823
Here you go, burt.
Your table's up here.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.859
And your tea's waiting
and your eggs'll be up in five.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.629
What is that-- new cologne?
I love it.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.631
Man:
Hey, kid! You're making a mess!

02:45.633 --> 02:48.901
Paige! Again your boy's all over

02:48.903 --> 02:51.236
With the shakers!
I know, he knows, I know.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.172
He's just having a hard
time adjusting in school.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.607
He'll be back next week.
Promise.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.543
Hey, honey. It's okay.

02:57.545 --> 03:01.180
Mr. Gianakos just likes
to keep things neat.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.383
Remember we talked about
that kind of thing before?

03:04.385 --> 03:07.252
Doesn't mean there's something
wrong with you, okay?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.308
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

03:32.345 --> 03:34.580
Paige:
Excuse me?

03:34.582 --> 03:35.981
Can I help you?

03:35.983 --> 03:38.383
No, but you should help him.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.954
Wireless is up.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.522
Don't yell at that boy.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.726
â™ª

03:47.728 --> 03:49.728
Radio dj: If you're sick of
being broke, for $108.3,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.396
Which month has 28 days?

03:51.398 --> 03:52.464
All of them.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.799
Woman:
I actually know this one!

03:53.801 --> 03:55.234
Uh, February?

03:55.236 --> 03:56.468
Radio dj:
We have a winner!

03:56.470 --> 03:58.937
Idiots.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.406
â™ª

04:09.249 --> 04:11.283
Okay, so if my math is right--
and it is--

04:11.285 --> 04:13.318
We can siphon
700 kilowatts a month

04:13.320 --> 04:15.487
Through the fall
before anyone even notices.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:16.757 --> 04:18.790
What are you doing?
Over 30,000 shock-related

04:18.792 --> 04:20.692
Accidents happen every year!
Woman: Please.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.327
I got this.

04:22.329 --> 04:23.962
See? Power's up.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.298
Why are you
stealing electricity?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.366
Just borrowing it

04:27.368 --> 04:28.900
Until they turn
our power back on.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.035
I thought we were
paying the bills

04:30.037 --> 04:31.536
After the credit
nationale job?

04:31.538 --> 04:35.340
I worked for three days
on this great loss algorithm

04:35.342 --> 04:36.808
For credit risk...
You got lost in the numbers

04:36.810 --> 04:38.510
And you forgot to pay
the electric bill.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.846
And the water bill and our rent.
And the payment

04:40.848 --> 04:43.715
Was all in cash,
which got misplaced.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.651
It's somewhere... Close.
When's the last time you ate?

04:45.653 --> 04:46.885
You mean, like, food?

04:46.887 --> 04:49.688
Okay, it's cool, I finished

04:49.690 --> 04:51.790
The lynwood job,
toby's picking up the fee.
Toby?

04:51.792 --> 04:52.991
Why not you?
I built the contractor

04:52.993 --> 04:54.660
An automated conveyance system

04:54.662 --> 04:56.061
And he called me sugar.
Hmm.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.963
So I hit him in the mouth.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.866
And toby is where exactly?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.048
â™ª

05:18.851 --> 05:21.687
Shh!
Keep your voices down!

05:21.689 --> 05:25.090
(car speeding away, outside)
uh, toby...

05:25.092 --> 05:28.627
First, can I note how I nearly
tripled the lynwood payment?

05:28.629 --> 05:29.695
So those thugs are
chasing you down

05:29.697 --> 05:31.830
To give you a big
congratulations?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.098
I beat them in poker!
They're born chumps!

05:33.100 --> 05:34.666
Pupils that dilate like saucers

05:34.668 --> 05:35.767
Whenever they had a good hand.
Come on!

05:35.769 --> 05:37.035
A harvard-trained behaviorist

05:37.037 --> 05:38.337
Should know that people

05:38.339 --> 05:42.474
No, you don't.
We have a combined I.Q.
Of nearly 700,

05:42.476 --> 05:44.343
And we can't even pay our bills.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.578
We had a bad day!
We've been at this two years!

05:46.580 --> 05:49.381
The whole reason why I started
this company is because

05:49.383 --> 05:51.450
We have more to offer
than just fixing routers!

05:51.452 --> 05:52.984
Walter, I'm reading a
textbook panic response

05:52.986 --> 05:56.621
Okay, if this thing is going
south, walt, just let me know,

05:56.623 --> 05:58.357
'cause I have a cousin
who owns a garage in phoenix...

05:58.359 --> 05:59.958
No matter how hard we try--

05:59.960 --> 06:01.460
And I know
we're all trying--

06:01.462 --> 06:05.964
We're a million miles
from normal.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.034
(banging)

06:09.036 --> 06:10.535
(shushing)

06:14.407 --> 06:15.841
Yo!

06:15.843 --> 06:17.476
(sirens wailing)

06:19.946 --> 06:21.046
Hey, good.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.514
Your timing's perfect.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.749
A guy in there ripped us off.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.719
I'll put a bag of pills
in your pocket

06:27.721 --> 06:29.721
Fat enough to get you
a room in lompoc.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.723
Understand?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.792
Now, hit it.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.464
Homeland security.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.600
Is this you?
No!

06:41.602 --> 06:43.602
We're looking
for walter o'brien!

06:46.906 --> 06:48.840
It's a badge.

06:54.614 --> 06:55.647
No, no, no, no.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.848
Get out. Get out!

06:56.850 --> 06:58.617
Get out of here now.
I wouldn't be here

06:58.619 --> 06:59.818
If I weren't desperate,
trust me.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.886
"trust you"?

07:00.888 --> 07:03.121
What is that-- a joke?
Who are you?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.756
He's federal agent cabe gallo.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.792
We worked together
years ago.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.660
The outcome was unfavorable.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.896
Put it aside, o'brien.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.197
I need you.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.466
45 minutes ago,
there was

07:14.468 --> 07:17.436
An automatic software upgrade
in the lax control tower.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.438
It had a bug.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.840
Now the entire system's down.
Happy: Wa-wa-wait...

07:21.842 --> 07:23.542
All the communications are down?

07:23.544 --> 07:24.676
Contact's been lost between

07:24.678 --> 07:26.211
Long beach, lax and burbank.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.079
Incoming flights
have been diverted.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.081
But the ones that were about
to start their descent--

07:30.083 --> 07:32.184
56 of them--
are out of comm range.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.553
Nsa's trying to work
a satellite hook-up.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.087
Fbi's attempting
a morse code

07:36.089 --> 07:37.923
Signal from the
observatory.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.091
We need you on software.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.929
Without landing guidance,
those planes run out of fuel.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.831
Sylvester:
And crash.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.199
And crash, walter!

07:47.201 --> 07:48.867
Sounds like...

07:48.869 --> 07:51.069
Catastrophe is imminent.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.071
So, go find someone else.
Now.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.474
How about a certified federal
check for $50,000

07:55.476 --> 07:57.542
In each of your pockets?

07:58.077 --> 08:00.512
I ran checks on all of you.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.181
Mechanical prodigy,
world-class shrink,

08:03.183 --> 08:05.183
A human calculator.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.687
Brilliant minds
working at half-capacity.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.689
You want to do
something meaningful?

08:10.691 --> 08:11.990
Here's your chance.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.059
You don't, people and metal

08:14.061 --> 08:17.562
Will be falling from the sky
in less than two hours.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.631
It's your call.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.554
Even with half my iq,
I wouldn't be

08:42.556 --> 08:43.588
Dumb enough
to believe you twice.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.589
"put it aside"?

08:44.591 --> 08:45.790
"forget about it and move on"

08:45.792 --> 08:47.659
Is not an option for people

08:47.661 --> 08:49.661
With photographic memories.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.795
Give us a minute.

08:59.171 --> 09:02.207
What the hell are you doing?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.678
I was mirroring you so your
subconscious can relate to me.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.713
I thought it would
help you relax.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.782
Do you think it's working?

09:12.818 --> 09:14.753
Breaking this down logically,
we're not just going to

09:14.755 --> 09:16.621
Let those people
fall out of the sky.

09:16.623 --> 09:17.789
I'm telling you--
I don't trust him.

09:17.791 --> 09:21.259
But without an influx
of capital, these two

09:21.261 --> 09:23.094
Are just gonna go back
to hacking banks.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.863
And the next forensic
analyst they run into

09:24.865 --> 09:27.132
Won't be as nice as you.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.234
Now, personally, I'm cool,
I can handle myself.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.670
Time is wasting.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.005
We've got 56 planes to land.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.615
Walter: Lax tower control
is the main hub

09:43.617 --> 09:44.783
For all the other airports.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.184
Fix the software there,
it autocorrects

09:46.186 --> 09:50.322
The glitch-- first step is to
delete that, then download

09:50.324 --> 09:51.923
The old software, should be
enough for the planes to land.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.792
So you're doing it?

09:53.794 --> 09:54.926
Sylvester:
We go to lax...

09:54.928 --> 09:57.896
We fix the software,
we are at a 90%

09:57.898 --> 10:00.065
Chance of success.
Grab your equipment.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.634
Mine, too, please?

10:02.636 --> 10:06.137
Must've been keeping tabs
on me to find me so quickly.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.974
I got promoted
to the l.A. Office.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.710
Only make sense that
I would track you down.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.979
Your body language suggests
that's about half the truth.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.885
Of course, there's a 10% chance
that everyone dies.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.787
You cross me on this,

10:22.789 --> 10:24.856
I'll go online...

10:24.858 --> 10:26.658
And in less than a hour,

10:26.660 --> 10:28.760
I will erase you.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.833
(p.A. Chiming)

10:34.835 --> 10:38.870
We should have
some more information shortly.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.873
Thank you for your patience.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.409
Still no contact.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.744
Your cell?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.145
Nothing.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.780
Back in the air force,
I once dropped

10:48.782 --> 10:50.382
Down to 1,500 feet
to catch a signal.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.716
If we descend without comms,

10:51.718 --> 10:52.951
We could run into another plane.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.786
I'm sure there's
an army of people

10:54.788 --> 10:56.221
Working on this as we speak.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.723
Toby:
<i>All right,</i>

10:58.725 --> 11:01.192
Listen, when the fbi
and the nsa fail, do we get

11:01.194 --> 11:03.094
Some kind of bonus here?
I'd be willing

11:03.096 --> 11:04.829
To go double or nothing.
I'm just saying.
Toby...

11:04.831 --> 11:06.197
They were your
top choice for this?

11:06.199 --> 11:07.832
Walter o'brien
is one of the five

11:07.834 --> 11:10.068
Smartest people alive,
so, yes.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.270
Dispatch: Be advised,
just got word from headquarters

11:12.272 --> 11:14.072
There's a major pile-up
on the 405.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.440
Lax is unreachable for hours.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.875
Repeat: Lax is a no-go.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.877
Copy that.
Toby:
Call for a helicopter.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.211
Cabe:
Air traffic's been shut down

11:20.213 --> 11:21.846
Until the situation is resolved.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.947
No copter?

11:22.949 --> 11:24.349
We're down to a 17% chance

11:24.351 --> 11:26.051
Of success.
Lloyd:
Pipe down, rain man.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.419
Call him that again,
you better hope

11:27.421 --> 11:29.688
The feds have
a good dental plan.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.856
This is what we get with
a car full of geniuses?
What you'll get

11:31.858 --> 11:33.892
Is a solution if everyone
keeps their mouth shut.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.927
Everyone, quiet!

11:35.929 --> 11:38.163
We don't need to go to lax.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.898
We just need a reliable
wireless signal

11:39.900 --> 11:41.266
With no chance of going down.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.868
I just fixed one
a mile north of here.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.870
(tires squealing)

11:45.872 --> 11:47.939
(sirens wailing)

11:50.176 --> 11:52.243
(door bell dings)

11:53.879 --> 11:55.013
Owner!

11:55.015 --> 11:57.782
Agent gallo,
homeland security.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.918
We need to commandeer your diner
for a national emergency.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.985
You can stay.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.221
But that's it.

12:04.156 --> 12:05.857
Everybody out!

12:05.859 --> 12:07.225
Come on! Everybody out!
Come on, come on!

12:07.227 --> 12:08.326
No, no, no, no, no.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.327
You-you pay tomorrow.
Come on.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.029
Come on, out! Out! Out!

12:11.031 --> 12:12.797
Gianakos:
Come on!

12:12.799 --> 12:13.998
What are you doing?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.867
Any idea the bacteria
on countertops?

12:15.869 --> 12:17.902
Just from chicken alone,
there are over 20 diseases

12:17.904 --> 12:18.937
You can get from exposure.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.939
This is wildly upsetting.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.375
No, no, no, no,
you stay.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.044
Uh, nemos,
no customers, no tip,

12:26.046 --> 12:27.278
And I cannot
leave ralph here with...

12:27.280 --> 12:28.947
Listen,
my immigration status

12:28.949 --> 12:31.950
Makes me not so comfortable
around federal agents.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.018
You lock up.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.058
Ralph?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.226
Good to see you again.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.827
Cabe:
Roughly 89 minutes

12:42.829 --> 12:44.195
Until the first plane

12:44.197 --> 12:45.430
Goes down.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.465
Their lives are in our hands.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.468
Paige:
Is there something wrong

12:50.470 --> 12:51.870
At lax?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.938
It's top-secret.

12:55.275 --> 12:59.010
If the guy who set up
our wireless is working on it?

12:59.012 --> 13:02.013
Happy, script a post check
after the system's stabilized.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.215
Sylvester, run the
odds on the patch

13:04.217 --> 13:05.517
Linking back into the software.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.852
We do not want
the same problem tomorrow.

13:07.854 --> 13:08.953
Toby...

13:08.955 --> 13:10.221
Look for a saboteur.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.523
Walter, look for coffee.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.825
This is gonna take me,
like, 90 seconds.

13:13.827 --> 13:14.826
Sylvester: Screw this up,
brains and guts

13:14.828 --> 13:16.060
Are gonna bounce all over town.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.295
Happy:
Actually, fuel tanks

13:17.297 --> 13:18.863
Ignite on impact.

13:18.865 --> 13:23.168
Eh, a blood-soaked spleen
could burn at a slower rate.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.502
Hey, please check

13:24.504 --> 13:26.204
Your language
around my nine-year-old.

13:27.573 --> 13:28.940
Be decent in my place of work.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.008
Thank you.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.344
(door opens)

13:33.346 --> 13:34.846
Secure channel to lax.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.114
Air traffic supervisor
is on the line.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.182
His name is brooks.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.550
Okay.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.852
Mr. Brooks, I'm hacking
into airport security.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.188
I'm gonna rotate your cameras
to point at the monitors.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.322
I'll see it remotely,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.291
And I'll walk you
through each step.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.592
Who am I on with here?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.327
I am not comfortable
with you hacking

13:49.329 --> 13:51.462
Into anything at this airport.
Then don't make it so easy.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.364
To answer your question,
my name is walter o'brien,

13:53.366 --> 13:55.934
And I was brought in to fix your
problem since you're not capable

13:55.936 --> 13:56.901
Of doing it yourself.

13:56.903 --> 13:57.969
Look behind you.

13:57.971 --> 14:01.139
I'm at your 10:00.
Our goal is to reboot

14:01.141 --> 14:02.407
Your computer
and land those planes.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.009
Hit control c right in between
the flickers

14:05.011 --> 14:06.311
At the exact moment
that I say now.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.912
Ready?

14:07.914 --> 14:08.980
Now.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.915
(beeps)
(groans)

14:10.917 --> 14:12.083
I missed. It's too fast.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.885
Moving on, you,

14:13.887 --> 14:15.553
Short sleeves and tie,
you in the glasses,

14:15.555 --> 14:16.621
You code, right?

14:16.623 --> 14:17.922
A little.

14:17.924 --> 14:18.957
How'd you know?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.124
Lucky guess. What's your name?

14:20.126 --> 14:22.961
Randy.
Randy, take mr. Brooks's seat.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.562
You guys are talking
about planes going down.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.997
I'm just an intern.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.398
You just got promoted.
Sit down!

14:27.400 --> 14:29.167
Walter:
Mr. Brooks, can you give randy

14:29.169 --> 14:31.002
The original installation disk
to download?

14:31.004 --> 14:33.004
That software was installed
15 years ago.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.405
I have no idea where it is.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.473
The company went
out of business.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.877
Blackstern data storage.
Okay, we can get a copy

14:38.879 --> 14:40.445
Of the old software
from the backup server.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.980
I e-mail it to brooks,
he clicks a link,

14:41.982 --> 14:43.615
And the system is up and running

14:43.617 --> 14:45.884
As if the corrupted software
was never downloaded.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.085
Blackstern's on ventura.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.654
Northeast. Opposite direction
of the gridlock.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.023
You should know
that the data is backed up

14:52.025 --> 14:54.959
To the latest software
every 12 hours on the five.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.662
So in 20 minutes, the last
remaining useable software

14:57.664 --> 14:59.097
Will be corrupted.
Happy, toby,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.633
Get to the server and
get me that backup disk.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.234
Sylvester, call the data center;
tell them we're on our way.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.036
I'm gonna prep here
to relay to lax.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.437
Bates, take 'em.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.039
Stay in contact.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.441
Walter, you tell that waitress
I'm gonna be right back.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.076
Toby, in situations like this,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.178
Carelessness, mistakes,
they will haunt you.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.281
I know this from experience.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.615
Walter, I'm always on point.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.018
Have you seen my hat?

15:23.289 --> 15:24.522
Here, I thought
you might be thirsty.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.523
Thank you.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.524
Mm-hmm.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.126
You have anemia.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.095
It turns your
fingernails pitted.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.263
That's why your polish
looks streaky.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.431
You need more iron.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.166
(chuckles)
okay.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.068
I don't recall asking, einstein.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.470
Einstein had a 160 iq.

15:39.472 --> 15:43.975
So you must know everything
about me, if you're that smart.

15:46.312 --> 15:49.113
You have no-name sneakers,
he has orthotics.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.148
Whatever you have
goes to ralph.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.150
The inflammation under your eyes

15:52.152 --> 15:53.484
From lack of sunlight comes

15:53.486 --> 15:55.186
From working two jobs...

15:55.188 --> 15:56.621
As for the boy's father,
I'd make

15:56.623 --> 15:58.423
Calculated assumptions

15:58.425 --> 16:01.259
In the realm of interpersonal
communication issues.

16:01.261 --> 16:05.063
Oh, so we split because
I have issues communicating.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.130
And I thought it was

16:06.132 --> 16:07.365
The blonde in tahoe.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.100
Who the hell are you to tell me

16:09.102 --> 16:10.535
That my polish looks cheap?

16:10.537 --> 16:13.371
That-that hurts my feelings.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.406
Do you understand?

16:15.408 --> 16:17.208
Yeah.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.411
I've been told things like that
a lot before.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.046
And my polish streaks
because ralph does it.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.648
He loves to paint,
and don't tell me

16:23.650 --> 16:25.383
That he needs help, either.
He's challenged.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.418
Have some empathy.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.661
(sighs)

16:36.663 --> 16:39.097
Challenged, huh?

16:39.099 --> 16:40.732
Look at sylvester and him.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.734
Do you know what
they're doing?

16:42.736 --> 16:45.370
The matches are the king,
the jelly is the queen,

16:45.372 --> 16:47.238
The sugar packets
are the knights.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.273
He's playing chess
with a grand master

16:49.275 --> 16:50.775
Who's about to lose.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.410
Walter, you see this?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.779
Check mate in eight moves.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.280
This kid is amazing!

16:56.282 --> 16:58.783
And he doesn't like
to paint your nails.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.119
He does it because he wants

17:01.121 --> 17:03.121
To hold your hand,
but he can't process

17:03.123 --> 17:04.689
Physical contact.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.692
So help him.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.194
Or he will never connect
with you.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.398
I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

17:13.400 --> 17:15.633
But your son is a genius.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.276
Happy:
<i>Walter, we're approaching</i>
<i>the data center.</i>

17:25.278 --> 17:27.612
<i>We should have</i>
<i>the backup hard drive soon.</i>

17:27.614 --> 17:29.213
Walter:
<i>Copy that, happy.</i>

17:29.215 --> 17:30.548
<i>Standing by.</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:34.118
(sirens wailing,
tires squealing)

17:35.554 --> 17:38.489
No, it's supposed
to be open 24/7!

17:38.491 --> 17:40.124
Looks like they cut out.

17:40.126 --> 17:43.294
We got a problem.
No one's home.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.563
You're the mechanical engineer!
Pick the lock!

17:45.565 --> 17:47.231
I have my tools, but it'll take
a lot longer

17:47.233 --> 17:49.333
Than the six minutes we have
before the bad software backs up

17:49.335 --> 17:51.202
Onto the servers.
Bates, get them in.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.770
Step aside.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.439
Whoa! Are you insane?

17:54.441 --> 17:57.408
You're the one putting hands
on a fed.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.710
That is 75-millimeter,
six-layer polycarbonate casing.

17:59.712 --> 18:03.281
It won't break, but a round
could deflect and kill somebody.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.482
Walt,

18:04.484 --> 18:05.683
Please don't let
the fed talk anymore.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.118
Sylvester:
We're down

18:07.120 --> 18:08.820
To a four-percent chance
of success.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.321
Cabe:
Five minutes from now,
the software we need

18:10.323 --> 18:11.556
Disappears forever.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.157
If that happens,

18:13.159 --> 18:14.659
20,000 people die.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.562
Hey, ralph, let's go
in the office, okay?

18:18.730 --> 18:20.364
Walter:
<i>We got to abandon</i>
<i>the data center.</i>

18:20.366 --> 18:21.632
We got to pull the team back,

18:21.634 --> 18:23.267
Get four minds
working together at once,

18:23.269 --> 18:24.735
And then, maybe within
an hour, we'll be able...

18:24.737 --> 18:26.437
By then, the first two planes
will be out of fuel.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.206
Do you really think
you can come up

18:28.208 --> 18:29.540
With an option by then?
Hold on.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.309
You're just accepting
two planes going down.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.643
We lose two planes
to save 54.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.646
That's a trade
we're gonna have to make.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.548
Contact the faa and tell them
these two flights are terminal.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.418
Agent gallo is implementing
the greater good theory.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.587
Loss is acceptable as long
as the resulting gain

18:42.589 --> 18:45.356
No, it isn't.
You save everybody.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.558
Normal people save everybody.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.627
I'm not normal.
I don't care!

18:49.629 --> 18:52.263
Use that 197 iq of yours.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.732
Take a deep breath and reset.

19:00.706 --> 19:01.873
Reset.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.207
Reset, reset.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.342
Happy, we need to reset

19:04.344 --> 19:05.476
The door lock.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.279
Ten blocks around
the data center.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.548
Kill the electricity to part
of los angeles?
Mm-hmm.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.682
Just turn it off
in that one building!

19:11.684 --> 19:13.417
We can't focus a surge
that precisely,

19:13.419 --> 19:14.785
But a brief power surge

19:14.787 --> 19:17.388
Will open up the door,
and we'll be able to get in.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.557
You're gonna owe me
a new slim pick.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.159
All right, we need to find
a municipal junction box

19:21.161 --> 19:22.360
That covers that area.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.561
It should be
on a commercial street.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.896
I'll check the south.
North.

19:27.700 --> 19:32.270
It'll take to overpower a surge
within a ten-block radius.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.604
No, no, no, no, no.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.274
Cabe:
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

19:36.276 --> 19:39.310
I can't calculate
without order; it's my process.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.245
My process involves my foot
in your ass.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.713
Hold on. Here.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.348
One piece.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.716
It's the biggest and
the smallest, so it's in order.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.252
That works.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.657
(horn blowing)

19:54.860 --> 19:56.861
Uh, sylvester, I don't want
to hurry your process...

19:56.863 --> 19:58.362
500,000 kilowatts!

19:58.364 --> 19:59.430
All right!

19:59.432 --> 20:01.432
We need exactly
500,000 kilowatts.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.500
Can you handle that?

20:02.502 --> 20:05.303
Who rigged our whole office
this morning?

20:05.305 --> 20:06.571
I'm on it.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.339
Okay, ready?

20:08.341 --> 20:09.640
Here we go.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.709
(electricity crackling,
power whirring down)

20:17.783 --> 20:19.550
We're in. We're in!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.385
There!

20:25.490 --> 20:26.958
Not good.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.393
We have less than a minute.
Which one is it?

20:29.395 --> 20:30.962
Okay, these servers
run the facilities.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.830
So the clients would be
in the cage.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.606
Yeah, this guy, he's the boss.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.708
Cuff links, tie clip,
anal micro-manager.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.776
Makes all the calls
as to what gets stored where.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.378
Look at his belt tail;
he's a lefty.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.479
So we eliminate
the right-side servers.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.616
A big client like lax
on his dominant hand side.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.883
There's still about
250 servers.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.453
Okay, you think lax,
you think planes.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.455
You think planes,
you think high, so eliminate

20:57.457 --> 20:58.456
The bottom
three shelves.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.690
100 servers left. Ten seconds.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.692
Get on it!
He's what, five-six, tops?

21:01.694 --> 21:04.462
Napoleonic boss man would
never use a step ladder

21:04.464 --> 21:05.663
In front of
his employees.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.697
So it's one
of these....

21:06.699 --> 21:07.865
This one!

21:07.867 --> 21:08.899
Ah!
Time's up.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.468
(servers whirring)

21:10.470 --> 21:12.536
How did you know for sure?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.405
'cause it says "lax"
right here.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.507
Oh...

21:16.509 --> 21:17.842
You are impressed.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.689
He doesn't even
know we're here.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.824
He's wondering
if those flashlights

21:33.826 --> 21:36.761
Can be powered by the heat
of the hand that holds them.

21:36.763 --> 21:39.764
Or he's calculating
the cubic footage

21:39.766 --> 21:41.032
Of the octagon clock.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.500
He thinks
about anything.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.734
Everything.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.304
Did you let him
beat you, earlier?

21:46.306 --> 21:48.506
No.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.841
I-I had no idea
he even liked chess.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.710
Sylvester: Few parents
meaningfully engage

21:52.712 --> 21:53.878
With mentally
enabled children.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.946
It's not your fault.

21:58.350 --> 22:01.485
It's just... How we are.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.757
How did your
parents handle it?

22:06.759 --> 22:09.593
Oh, I-I haven't spoken
to them in ten years.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.098
(rapid beeping)

22:16.735 --> 22:18.669
Nsa satellite link failed.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.404
Where the hell
are your people?

22:20.406 --> 22:23.074
That kid toby doesn't exactly
fill me with confidence.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.676
Toby grew up penniless,

22:25.678 --> 22:26.877
Gambled his way through school.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.746
Even then,
he got his doctorate

22:28.748 --> 22:29.880
At the age of 17.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.616
Sometimes people like us need...

22:32.618 --> 22:35.019
Repair... Before we can fit
into your world.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.954
I know the aftermath
was devastating.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.724
I did keep tabs on you.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.760
Toby:
Seat backs and tray tables up!

22:42.762 --> 22:45.563
Those planes are
as good as landed.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.731
Endlessly patting
himself on the back,

22:46.733 --> 22:47.798
The whole ride here.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.800
I just want a statue
of me at lax.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.868
Now what?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.002
Easy as sending a file.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.804
Mr. Brooks, in a moment,

22:53.806 --> 22:54.839
You'll receive
a bug-free version

22:54.841 --> 22:56.040
Of the software.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.708
All you have to do
is open your e-mail

22:57.710 --> 22:59.677
And click a link.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.847
(rapid beeping)
wait.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.115
The hard drive's frozen.

23:04.117 --> 23:05.483
The files are corrupted.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.519
We took it out
as carefully as we could.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.720
Walter:
How'd you transport it?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.921
It was wrapped
in a towel,

23:10.923 --> 23:12.857
Tucked in a door console
so I wouldn't drop it.

23:13.992 --> 23:16.560
Was there an audio speaker
in the door?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.828
Toby:
Yeah. So?

23:17.830 --> 23:20.698
What?
The magnet erased
the hard drive.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.866
It's useless now.
No, no, no, no.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.501
It's not my fault.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.869
I didn't know anything about
magnets in car speakers.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.570
You've stolen
hundreds of them, toby.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.141
No place on earth
has what we need.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.076
Cabe:
Fbi just texted.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.745
They're out, too.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.081
We're at less
than one percent,

23:37.083 --> 23:38.149
Walter...

23:52.731 --> 23:53.898
You know what I'm
going to tell you.

23:53.900 --> 23:54.899
There was
a fourth team.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.735
Tracking the planes via radar.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.204
Circling over the ocean...

24:00.206 --> 24:01.572
Fighter jets...

24:01.574 --> 24:02.540
You'll shoot them down?

24:02.542 --> 24:06.977
On 9/11 to prevent
possible ground casualties.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.847
Can you think of
anything we can do?

24:13.084 --> 24:14.985
(speed dial blipping)

24:14.987 --> 24:16.921
Contact director merrick.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.924
Tell him we need to activate
the fourth option.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.826
Paige:
Hey...

24:21.828 --> 24:22.860
Walter.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.161
I know what's going on.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.897
Actually, uh, there's only
100 people in the world

24:26.899 --> 24:28.232
Who really know anything

24:28.234 --> 24:29.867
And unfortunately,
you're not one of them.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.803
When he doesn't understand
how to fix a problem.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.472
He panics and
shuts down.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.573
When you don't know something,

24:35.575 --> 24:36.574
You feel like
you don't know anything.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.775
For all practical purposes,

24:37.777 --> 24:38.976
I have no right brain.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.978
People with high iq
tend to have low eq.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.979
That's emotional quotient.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.747
So these big speeches,
pep talks...

24:43.749 --> 24:45.950
They work on athletes,
they work on children,

24:45.952 --> 24:46.984
They work on waitresses.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.888
I never
called you that.
But I'm
smart enough

24:50.890 --> 24:53.524
You don't know how
to solve the problem

24:53.526 --> 24:54.892
And you're terrified
because people will die.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.126
Well, they won't die
because of me.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.661
And they won't live
because of you, either,

24:57.663 --> 24:59.129
Because you're just giving up
and walking away.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.599
Don't lecture me about how
people dying will make me feel.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.766
I already know!

25:06.238 --> 25:07.671
What does that mean?

25:11.042 --> 25:13.077
Walter...

25:14.880 --> 25:16.881
...What does that mean?

25:26.658 --> 25:27.691
Hey, sweetheart.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.027
Let's go back
inside, okay?

25:37.970 --> 25:41.572
I'll draft an alert for the
emergency broadcast system asap.

25:41.574 --> 25:42.940
Don't hang up.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.808
Tell them there's
still a chance.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.677
Put a pin in that, sir.
We may have something here.

25:46.679 --> 25:50.814
They use a duplicate copy to
communicate with the tower.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.182
Now, if they took off
before this morning's update,

25:52.184 --> 25:53.217
Like a flight from

25:53.219 --> 25:54.952
Australia
or new zealand,

25:54.954 --> 25:56.687
They'll still have
the bug-free software on board.

25:56.689 --> 25:57.755
Cabe:
Okay.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.024
But we still have
the same problem.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.892
What we need is
seven miles over our head

26:01.894 --> 26:03.027
And there's no way
to get in touch

26:03.029 --> 26:04.061
With the people who have it.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.604
Yes, there is.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.278
<i>Get me there in ten, and I can</i>
<i>download that software.</i>

26:21.280 --> 26:22.980
If you're gonna shut
down all the roads

26:22.982 --> 26:24.081
That lead to
klemmer airfield,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.282
There's gonna be lots
of moving parts.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.817
I still think it's
the wrong play;

26:26.819 --> 26:27.952
The runways are too short there.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.353
It's just a low fly-by.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.623
If something goes wrong,
you take out half a block.

26:32.625 --> 26:33.924
It's actually four blocks,
but I won't let that happen.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.860
To get lapd to set up
rolling road blocks.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.129
We're talking about major
roads in a major city.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.065
There's safety risks,
there's procedure...

26:41.067 --> 26:43.133
I know what you're doing.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.002
You're covering yourself
in case of casualties.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.904
I don't put protocol over lives.

26:46.906 --> 26:47.972
Lives?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.640
Suddenly you're worried
about lives?

26:49.642 --> 26:50.708
We can debate the past later.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.042
Right now, if you want my help,

26:52.044 --> 26:53.310
Then let me make the calls

26:53.312 --> 26:54.979
And see if I can't get
this done for you.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.246
Let's go.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.051
I know he thinks he's helping,

27:01.053 --> 27:02.252
But we don't
have time for

27:02.254 --> 27:03.320
Bureaucracy right now.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.089
Happy, if I hack you
into the dot,

27:05.091 --> 27:06.390
Can you manipulate
the traffic signals?

27:06.392 --> 27:07.725
They're on standard
sequencers;

27:07.727 --> 27:09.059
Don't see why not.
So you shut down

27:09.061 --> 27:10.361
The roads,
we drive fast as hell,

27:10.363 --> 27:11.895
We might be able to pull
this off. Toby,

27:11.897 --> 27:13.163
I need you to check
the manifest...

27:13.165 --> 27:14.698
For a passenger
up there

27:14.700 --> 27:15.833
Whose phone is still on.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.201
Walt, I got this.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.069
Don't worry.
All right.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.038
I'm gonna need to upgrade
my wireless antenna software

27:21.040 --> 27:25.242
So someone's gonna
have to drive me there.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.011
Um... I don't have my license,

27:27.013 --> 27:28.212
But--

27:28.214 --> 27:29.847
I'm more of a bus guy--

27:29.849 --> 27:31.215
I-I understand the
basic mechanics

27:31.217 --> 27:33.050
Of-of how
this works...
Sylvester.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.386
I really need you here,
helping toby.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.656
But thank you, pal.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.043
Uh, driving through l.A.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.310
With nothing
but green lights--

28:00.312 --> 28:02.112
It's kind of always been
a fantasy of mine.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.247
At high speed? No.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.348
Somebody's gotta drive.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.016
Come on.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.419
Your son needs you.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.320
I've tried really hard,

28:10.322 --> 28:12.122
But I've never been able
to fully connect with him,

28:12.124 --> 28:14.425
Not in the way that I've seen
him connect with you guys today.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.227
What my son needs

28:17.229 --> 28:19.396
Is to see me help you.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.767
Please, walter.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.270
You're a good mom.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.175
Or a very bad one.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.409
No, we need roads blocked
the entire time.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.078
Why do I need to call
the highway patrol?

28:34.080 --> 28:35.279
We're only staying
on side streets!

28:35.281 --> 28:36.346
(tires squealing)

28:39.084 --> 28:41.218
What the...?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.053
Happy:
<i>Okay, walter,</i>

28:43.055 --> 28:44.388
<i>I'm tracking you</i>
<i>on the traffic cams.</i>

28:44.390 --> 28:47.424
They should start
changing... Now.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.461
It's working!

28:53.798 --> 28:54.398
Hold on!

28:55.800 --> 28:56.834
(horn honking)

29:00.939 --> 29:03.207
We're at 100. This thing
doesn't have air bags.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.075
Well, you know, at these
speeds, they're useless.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.343
Go faster.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.516
They all have their phones off
'cause they're on a damn plane.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.284
How the hell am I supposed
to communicate with them?

29:14.286 --> 29:15.986
I'm checking sigalert;
you should head south

29:15.988 --> 29:17.321
On hilgard to manning,

29:17.323 --> 29:18.756
Then santa monica to bundy.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.057
I'll get you a clear path.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.431
I think that's
agent gallo!

29:27.433 --> 29:29.266
Keep driving.

29:29.268 --> 29:32.503
I can't get the light on
barrington to change over.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.305
No, no, walter...

29:35.307 --> 29:37.975
No, no, no, no, no! No!

29:43.148 --> 29:44.214
Oh...
Oh, god.

29:50.388 --> 29:52.189
What the hell was that?

29:52.191 --> 29:55.459
Greater good theory in practice.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.527
Now just get to that airfield

29:56.529 --> 29:58.162
And don't make me regret this!

29:58.164 --> 30:00.464
Walter:
<i>We're almost there.</i>

30:00.466 --> 30:03.567
On one of those planes
with an active phone?

30:03.569 --> 30:06.336
Sylvester, I need more
passenger names.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.538
Novell software
technology's too old

30:07.540 --> 30:09.406
To do any this
in five minutes.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.475
And even if someone's
phone was on,

30:11.477 --> 30:13.143
How do we get in touch
with them at 36,000 feet?

30:13.145 --> 30:14.244
Old technology!

30:14.246 --> 30:15.379
That's it!
We-we-we find someone

30:15.381 --> 30:17.214
With an out-of-date
analog phone.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.515
The receivers are 10 times
stronger than smartphones.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.417
They can get a
signal up there.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.419
All right, we lose
anyone under 50.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.556
Can't work for
a tech company...

30:25.558 --> 30:26.890
Salesmen!

30:26.892 --> 30:28.458
Salesmen never
turn off their phones.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.027
They risk losing business.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.195
And... Duh duh
duh duh duh duh...

30:31.197 --> 30:32.462
Gordon tooley!

30:32.464 --> 30:34.531
Plastics salesman from reseda

30:34.533 --> 30:36.233
Returning from a work trip.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.402
Service is linked to
a retron a-64 analog.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.403
Call him!

30:39.405 --> 30:41.471
(phone ringing)

30:49.480 --> 30:50.480
Hello?

30:50.482 --> 30:52.049
Mr. Tooley, listen carefully.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.483
This is homeland security.

30:53.485 --> 30:54.484
There's an emergency
on your flight.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.485
We need your help.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.887
Nice try, sully.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.455
I'll see you at work, ya putz.

30:58.457 --> 31:02.626
Outside of your window are
the santa monica mountains.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.493
And right above them

31:03.495 --> 31:05.229
<i>Are two f-22s,</i>

31:05.231 --> 31:07.097
<i>Ready to shoot you</i>
<i>out of the sky.</i>

31:07.099 --> 31:08.565
So I need you
to get off your ass,

31:08.567 --> 31:11.401
And tell them to get your phone
to the pilot.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.938
Captain: This is captain pike,
standing by.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.607
Captain pike, you're carrying
an uncorrupted version

31:16.609 --> 31:19.243
Of control tower software.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.411
Now, you need to e-mail it to me
so it can be downloaded at lax.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.980
Copy.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.482
But our onboard wireless
only has a limited reach.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.484
What do you want me to do?

31:27.486 --> 31:29.119
Buzz the tower at 100 feet.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.587
I should be able to grab
your wireless.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.389
Where will you be?
We just arrived

31:32.391 --> 31:33.390
At klemmer airfield;
we called ahead.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.391
Runway two has been cleared.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.227
Could be there in
less than a minute.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.163
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats

31:40.165 --> 31:41.331
With your seat belt fastened.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.432
Mr. O'brien?
Yes.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.567
I've got a space cleared
for you up here.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.469
Thank you. Okay.

31:45.471 --> 31:46.536
I've linked
my computer up to lax,

31:46.538 --> 31:48.238
So as soon
as I get the download,

31:48.240 --> 31:49.640
They'll have it as well.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.575
Here it comes.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.678
I should be able to catch
your wi-fi signal

31:54.680 --> 31:56.146
And download your software.

32:00.351 --> 32:02.119
This is captain pike.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.520
Do I have confirmation? Over.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.556
Were you able to download
that software?

32:06.558 --> 32:09.326
No, there's too much
of a speed differential

32:09.328 --> 32:10.360
Between a plane

32:10.362 --> 32:11.495
And a stationary laptop.
Over.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.297
Let's try again.
Doing the same thing

32:13.299 --> 32:15.666
But expecting a different result
is the definition of insanity.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.301
It won't work.

32:17.303 --> 32:20.570
Mr. O'brien,
I've got 240 souls onboard.

32:20.572 --> 32:23.440
Please tell me there's
something else you can do.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.276
I just solved
the speed differential problem.

32:28.947 --> 32:33.016
Happy, I need you to get me
into a ferrari 458.

32:33.018 --> 32:35.619
Force the gas cap open.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.287
There's an engine cover
emergency release.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.689
All right.
Left hand side
of the engine bay.

32:38.691 --> 32:43.060
(engine revving)
can you get that plane
about eight feet off the ground?

32:43.062 --> 32:45.629
Eight feet? What for?
Can't risk missing

32:45.631 --> 32:47.497
The wireless signal again, so
we're gonna have to hardwire it

32:47.499 --> 32:49.566
Into the computer.
You're the world's smartest
computer guy,

32:49.568 --> 32:51.201
And this comes down
to plugging something in?

32:51.203 --> 32:52.669
Pike:
How exactly

32:52.671 --> 32:54.604
Do you plan on doing this?
We're gonna be driving

32:54.606 --> 32:55.739
200 miles an hour
underneath you.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.541
What?
Yeah.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.176
You'll only have seven seconds
to receive that file.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.244
Any longer, we're not gonna
get this plane back up,

33:01.246 --> 33:03.380
And we will crash.
On top of us?

33:03.382 --> 33:04.681
That will not happen,
most likely.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.583
Do it in one minute.
Roger that.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.418
Good luck.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.187
You were in the
air force, right?

33:10.189 --> 33:12.656
Uh-huh.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.425
You-you expect me to sit
in this car

33:15.427 --> 33:18.061
No, you're gonna be standing up
through the sunroof.

33:18.063 --> 33:20.263
Oh, okay.
All right, okay, okay.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.665
You-you're gonna have
to trust me now.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.667
I will not let
anything happen to you.

33:23.669 --> 33:27.137
You're the one that said
you wanted to save everyone.

33:29.073 --> 33:31.408
This is our only chance.

33:40.485 --> 33:43.120
Preparing for second approach.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.359
Randy: Okay, we're in sync
with mr. O'brien's laptop.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.328
Let's hope this works.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.763
(engine roaring,
tires squealing)

33:56.401 --> 33:57.401
Paige: <i>Oh, my god.</i>

33:57.403 --> 33:58.602
You ready?
No...

33:58.604 --> 33:59.770
Hit the roof panel.
No.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.538
Hit the roof panel.
Okay, okay.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.639
Do it now!

34:15.520 --> 34:18.321
(breathing deeply)

34:19.624 --> 34:21.191
Oh, my god.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.492
Oh, my god!

34:22.494 --> 34:23.794
All right.

34:23.796 --> 34:27.164
(tires squealing)

34:37.442 --> 34:38.842
Oh, my god!

34:38.844 --> 34:40.243
Co-pilot:
Come on!

34:40.245 --> 34:41.311
You got to reach it!

34:41.313 --> 34:43.380
I can't reach it!

34:43.382 --> 34:45.115
(groans)

34:45.117 --> 34:46.349
Come on, reach for it.
Just try!

34:46.351 --> 34:48.285
Okay.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.519
Walter:
Drop the cable!

34:49.521 --> 34:50.754
Drop it now!

34:50.756 --> 34:52.823
Come on, you got to get it! Now!

34:52.825 --> 34:54.391
Reach!

34:54.393 --> 34:55.358
I got it!

34:55.360 --> 34:56.393
Yes!

34:56.395 --> 34:58.395
I got it! Okay, it's in.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.796
It's downloading,
it's downloading!

34:59.798 --> 35:01.398
What's it say?
I don't know, uh,

35:01.400 --> 35:02.365
A few seconds;
it needs a few seconds.

35:02.367 --> 35:03.366
We're running out of road!

35:03.368 --> 35:05.402
Still loading!

35:06.304 --> 35:07.637
Oh, come on, pal, up...

35:11.275 --> 35:13.710
Just a few seconds! Almost!

35:13.712 --> 35:15.312
Oh, no, no! No, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

35:15.314 --> 35:16.580
No, hold on!
Walter!

35:16.582 --> 35:18.515
Walter! It's done!
Hold on! Hold on to it!

35:18.517 --> 35:19.883
It's going!

35:19.885 --> 35:21.384
(tires squealing)

35:21.853 --> 35:23.587
Got it! (groans)

35:28.759 --> 35:29.826
Look out!

35:29.828 --> 35:31.428
(screaming)

35:33.264 --> 35:35.365
(tires squealing)

35:39.570 --> 35:41.371
We're back on.
(cheering)

35:41.373 --> 35:43.273
Mayday, mayday.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.508
Communications restored.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.209
(cheering)

35:46.211 --> 35:47.544
We'll have you all

35:47.546 --> 35:49.379
Safely on the ground in moments.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.448
Please confirm.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.150
(cheering continues)

35:53.152 --> 35:55.485
Your mom did that.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.424
(coughing, retching)

36:01.426 --> 36:03.660
(laughs)

36:10.535 --> 36:13.503
Deal's a deal.

36:13.505 --> 36:17.407
(sighs deeply)

36:17.409 --> 36:19.342
Paige...

36:19.344 --> 36:20.477
She deserves a share.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.512
I'll see to it.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.381
When we worked together,

36:24.383 --> 36:27.250
That didn't pan out
the way either of us wanted.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.419
I was hoping,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.588
Moving forward,
things could be different.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.590
Moving forward?

36:33.592 --> 36:36.526
I came to l.A. To start
a strategic response team.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.428
At any given time,
we deal with everything

36:38.430 --> 36:40.697
From stolen nukes
to missing kids

36:40.699 --> 36:43.500
To counterfeit cash so good
it can collapse our economy

36:43.502 --> 36:45.468
In less than a month.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.903
The bad guys are
getting smarter.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.639
And I can't train my agents
to think like you do.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.409
I have the full resources
of the u.S. Government.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.444
I need your help,

36:54.446 --> 36:57.347
And I think you
and your team need a home.

37:04.622 --> 37:05.989
Here.

37:08.526 --> 37:11.695
"fixed salaries, cars,

37:11.697 --> 37:13.863
Research lab."

37:13.865 --> 37:16.499
You saw this coming.

37:16.501 --> 37:19.336
It was your only logical move.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.404
(sighs)

37:36.754 --> 37:38.488
Okay, lips are parted,
leaning slightly forward.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.024
You have something
to tell us.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.826
He offered us jobs.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.029
Me, too?

37:46.031 --> 37:48.298
We're a team, aren't we?

37:51.769 --> 37:53.770
The waitress just left
to bring her son home.

37:53.772 --> 37:54.904
You just missed her.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.507
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

37:58.776 --> 37:59.876
Walter.

37:59.878 --> 38:00.944
Come in.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.312
I know it's, uh, late.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.446
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to, um,

38:03.448 --> 38:06.916
Say thank you
for your help today.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.551
You're welcome.

38:09.654 --> 38:12.422
You came all the way over here
to tell me that?

38:12.424 --> 38:14.391
No, I also wanted
to offer you a job.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.026
Government-funded
problem solvers.

38:16.028 --> 38:18.728
Uh... Why?

38:18.730 --> 38:20.930
I'm-I'm not a genius.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.632
No, but you are raising one.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.568
That takes, uh,
someone smart, brave...

38:25.570 --> 38:28.805
Now, our work requires, uh,

38:28.807 --> 38:29.939
Interaction with people.

38:29.941 --> 38:30.974
It's not our strength.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.076
You want to know about your son,

38:33.078 --> 38:35.512
I can translate him for you.

38:35.514 --> 38:40.016
You translate
the world for us.

38:43.421 --> 38:44.854
It's, um...

38:44.856 --> 38:46.756
Salary...

38:46.758 --> 38:48.558
Plus benefits.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.760
You're worried about not being
able to connect with ralph.

38:52.630 --> 38:55.532
That is a second chance.

38:59.904 --> 39:02.105
For you, too.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.575
With you and cabe.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.682
When I was 16, cabe asked me
to develop tracking software

39:12.684 --> 39:15.819
To drop military aid packages.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.421
So months later, I, uh,

39:18.423 --> 39:20.423
I turned on the tv,

39:20.425 --> 39:23.126
And I saw bombs falling
on baghdad.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.561
They were using my system,

39:24.563 --> 39:27.964
And I designed it
for speed over accuracy.

39:27.966 --> 39:31.735
So 2,000 civilians died.

39:34.472 --> 39:35.739
Walter, you...

39:35.741 --> 39:37.374
You were just a kid.

39:37.376 --> 39:39.542
Yeah, so is ralph.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.544
So tell him to ignore
any sentence that starts

39:41.546 --> 39:43.980
With "normally."

39:43.982 --> 39:45.582
Make sure that he's not scared

39:45.584 --> 39:48.017
Of anything
that he's capable of.

39:48.019 --> 39:51.654
And he'll find it difficult
to make friends,

39:51.656 --> 39:54.824
And sometimes he'll feel
like no one else

39:54.826 --> 39:56.526
In the world likes him.

39:56.528 --> 40:00.630
You just got to make sure that
he knows it's not his fault.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.700
Ralph:
Hi, walter.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.769
Hey, ralph.

40:07.571 --> 40:10.740
He-he doesn't talk
to anyone but me.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.543
He recognizes one of his own.

40:17.448 --> 40:19.182
May I?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.017
Thank you.

40:26.023 --> 40:28.992
Electronic voice:
Three, two, one.

40:28.994 --> 40:32.962
You ever pause
your dreams, ralph?

40:32.964 --> 40:35.165
Yeah.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.101
Ever rewind them?

40:38.103 --> 40:40.170
Sometimes.

40:42.673 --> 40:45.041
Yeah, me, too.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.109
