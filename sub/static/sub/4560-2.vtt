the Senior Pier Party tonight.

11:48.839 --> 11:52.212
I mean, just say the word
and I'll stay here with you.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.216
- [smacking]
- No, it's fine. Go.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.250
Well, all right.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.823
But, I probably won't
have a good time.

12:04.494 --> 12:08.358
No! Don't let the fact
that my life is in ruins

12:08.358 --> 12:10.360
spoil your senior fun.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.964
Go! Enjoy!

12:15.735 --> 12:17.237
OK!

12:28.378 --> 12:29.980
Forget it!

12:29.980 --> 12:31.852
I am not going
without my best friend!

12:31.852 --> 12:33.383
- Really?
- Yeah! I mean...

12:33.383 --> 12:35.255
They may be able
to keep you out of school,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.888
but they can't keep
you out of football games,

12:37.888 --> 12:40.991
or Homecoming dances,
or Senior Night at the pier!

12:40.991 --> 12:42.292
You know what?
You're right!

12:42.292 --> 12:44.895
I gave the best three years
of my life to that school.

12:44.895 --> 12:47.137
I deserve to be there
as much as everybody else!

12:47.137 --> 12:48.899
What're they gonna do,
throw me out?

12:48.899 --> 12:50.270
- [scoffs]
- Throw you out?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.403
- You can't throw me out!
- That's right!

12:53.403 --> 12:55.275
You're gonna have
to get through me

12:55.275 --> 12:57.147
and I'd like
to see you do that!

12:57.147 --> 12:59.179

you're just gonna have to wait

I can do for you, Hannah?

13:46.326 --> 13:49.059
Nope. Just want to be treated
like a normal student.

13:49.059 --> 13:50.330
Well, as far as
I'm concerned,

13:50.330 --> 13:52.102
you're just another kid
in the hall.

13:53.203 --> 13:54.604
- Oh!

13:54.604 --> 13:57.337

14:12.622 --> 14:16.486
Hannah Montana wants
to be treated like
a regular student...

- Except no P.E.
- Except no P.E.!

14:19.960 --> 14:22.362
Other than that,
a regular girl.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.494
A regular girl!

14:29.369 --> 14:31.972
That should do it.
And, if that doesn't work,

14:31.972 --> 14:33.643
you can always try
putting on a wig

14:33.643 --> 14:35.375
and pretending to be
somebody else.

All right, guys,
off to class!

14:44.114 --> 14:46.516
Don't want to be
Hannah Mon-tardy!

15:06.536 --> 15:09.039
OK, normal senior...

15:09.039 --> 15:12.282
I'm really looking forward to
working on the senior float.

15:12.282 --> 15:16.686

15:16.686 --> 15:18.318
Oh, boy.

15:25.695 --> 15:27.927
This is nice.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.560
- Real cozy.
- Yeah.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.562
See if you feel that way when
you have to go to the bathroom.

15:32.562 --> 15:34.564
Actually, I already tried it.
Wasn't that bad.

15:34.564 --> 15:36.466

applause in there before.

Joannie, would you
tell her I like her top?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.314
You tell her.
I don't even like her.

15:44.314 --> 15:47.947
- [whining] Please!
- Wow, you're annoying.

15:49.579 --> 15:52.352
- Thank you!
- Out of the way,
out of my way...

No, no, no, please.
No reason to freak out.

you know, senior to senior?

16:11.741 --> 16:13.743

16:13.743 --> 16:15.345
Thanks.
I love yours, too.

just a compliment. Please...

float or something.

that surprise you?

I mean, that's why we came up
with Hannah Montana
in the first place.

20:45.014 --> 20:49.248

to wait a whole semester

to work on the Homecoming float.

gets everything she wants.

get to spend

21:09.369 --> 21:11.641
the entire summer
touring Europe.

21:11.641 --> 21:15.044
And though you won't be
on yearbook committee,

21:15.044 --> 21:17.947
Hannah did meet the
President of the United States.
