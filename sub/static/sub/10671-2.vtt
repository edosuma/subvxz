00:04.814 --> 00:07.985
<i>...the courage to change the things I can</i>

00:08.068 --> 00:10.821
<i>and the wisdom to know the difference.</i>

00:13.949 --> 00:18.411
I think that there's really only
one honest, but lots of truths.

00:18.495 --> 00:19.621
- And the key...
- Hey.

00:19.705 --> 00:24.960
What's up, man? The key, for me, anyways,
is just being honest about all of them.

00:25.627 --> 00:27.337
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

00:30.507 --> 00:33.719
Hey, listen, if you ever want to talk
about anything, come see me at the store.

00:33.802 --> 00:35.136
- That's me.
- Okay.

00:36.262 --> 00:38.515
Hey, man. You talk to Jerry yet?

00:38.598 --> 00:39.975
- No, man. No. It's...
- Why?

00:40.059 --> 00:42.143
It's probably nothing.

00:42.227 --> 00:44.521
He had an appraisal done.
It's not nothing.

00:44.604 --> 00:48.901
So, dude? That's his move, man.
It's like a tax dodge.

00:48.984 --> 00:51.277
He's probably going to,
like, sell the building to himself

00:51.361 --> 00:54.280
through a company that's owned
by his cat or something, man.

00:54.364 --> 00:56.033
- It's Jerry.
- Fucking Jerry, man.

00:56.116 --> 00:57.826
- No shit.
- Hey, take care of yourself.

00:57.910 --> 01:02.081
I will. Don't worry. I know Jerry.
What about London? You talk to her yet?

01:02.122 --> 01:03.582
- Yeah, sort of.
- Yeah?

01:03.665 --> 01:07.293
- I got a look at her Facebook page.
- And...?

01:07.377 --> 01:11.715
Not a lot to go on, to be honest with you,
except for a lot of sunsets.

01:11.798 --> 01:13.425
She's kind of mysterious, you know?

01:13.508 --> 01:15.301
- Yeah, I like that.
- How...?

01:15.385 --> 01:20.306
For you. For you, obviously, dude.
Come on. I mean for you.

01:20.390 --> 01:21.725
What can I do to help?

01:21.808 --> 01:24.686
Oh, well, she's looking
for places in Mar Vista.

01:24.770 --> 01:26.980
Oh, dude. That's no good.
That's the other side of Lincoln.

01:27.064 --> 01:28.648
Now you'll never see her.

01:28.732 --> 01:31.110
Yeah. I already feel like I'm losing her.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.737
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.
There's plenty of time to lose her.

01:33.820 --> 01:36.489
- Yeah.
- First, you got to get her.

01:36.573 --> 01:39.785
It's too soon, man, you know?
I haven't gotten to know her well enough

01:39.868 --> 01:43.246
to know what it is that I need
to pretend to have in common with her.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.457
- That's a good point.
- Yeah.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.668
I... Plus, what if she doesn't like me?

01:48.752 --> 01:50.545
Oh, dude. Come on. She'll like you.

01:50.629 --> 01:53.006
And you know what? If she doesn't,
then it's not meant to be.

01:53.090 --> 01:54.174
Well, don't say that.

01:54.257 --> 01:56.426
You've just got to have the serenity
to accept the things, man.

01:56.509 --> 01:57.844
Don't say that either.

01:57.928 --> 02:00.597
- And the wisdom to know the difference.
- And definitely don't say that!

02:02.223 --> 02:05.060
You've got a serious platitude problem.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.388 --> 02:45.184
Come on, man. What are you doing?
You're the one who wanted a coffee.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.560
Yeah, but if I go in,
then I'll have to pay for it.

02:47.644 --> 02:49.604
I can't go in there
and ask for two free coffees.

02:49.688 --> 02:54.026
Why not? Come on, this kid
looks up to you. You love this shit.

02:54.109 --> 02:56.653
Hey, look, you get the coffees
and I'll go open up your store.

02:56.736 --> 02:59.280
- Fine.
- Thanks, bro. See ya.

03:01.116 --> 03:02.367
- Chip?
- Hey.

03:02.450 --> 03:06.329
Great to see you, man.
What can I get you? The "uzhe"?

03:06.412 --> 03:09.749
You know what? I'll take two "uzhes."
Need a little extra jolt this morning.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.711
- You got it, man. Coming up.
- All right.

03:14.087 --> 03:15.088
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:15.714 --> 03:17.883
You know Chip
and you still want to ditch Venice?

03:17.966 --> 03:20.343
Yeah, it's more like Venice
wants to ditch me.

03:20.426 --> 03:22.221
Oh. What happened?

03:22.303 --> 03:26.933
A number of things.
Mostly, it's so expensive.

03:27.017 --> 03:28.476
Yeah. Even the free coffee's,
like, five bucks.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.353
Yeah. I was going to get a scone,

03:30.436 --> 03:32.939
but I think I'll spend the money
on a new car instead.

03:33.940 --> 03:37.360
What else? Sorry. You said
there were a number of things.

03:37.443 --> 03:39.946
Oh, yeah. I just...
I don't think Venice is for me.

03:40.030 --> 03:42.074
You know, I thought it was.
I thought I'd come here,

03:42.157 --> 03:46.119
and everything would fall into place
and I'd know what to do, but...

03:49.289 --> 03:51.791
Yeah. Well, it's still early days.

03:51.875 --> 03:55.628
When I first moved to Venice, things got
a lot worse before they got better.

03:55.712 --> 03:59.132
- Here you go. Two free coffees.
- Great. Thanks, man.

03:59.216 --> 04:02.635
- Free as in "on the house" or...?
- Yeah. Is that okay?

04:02.719 --> 04:05.597
Yeah. No, it's great.
It's just a little ambiguous, is all.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.893
Okay, well, either it was nice to meet you
or I'll see you around.

04:09.976 --> 04:12.020
- Yeah. Bye.
- See ya.

04:40.423 --> 04:43.426
Oh, shit! I'm so sorry.

04:43.509 --> 04:46.763
That's okay.
It was for a friend, so...

04:46.846 --> 04:49.891
- Sorry.
- Hey, you know what? I'm a total idiot.

04:49.975 --> 04:53.478
I should have thought of this before.
I actually have a studio apartment open.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.480
Is it... is it furnished?

04:55.563 --> 04:59.442
Well, it's above a furniture store,
but... no.

04:59.525 --> 05:01.778
Sounds great.
Yeah, I'd love to have a look.

05:01.861 --> 05:03.280
Okay.

05:03.363 --> 05:04.489
Are you going there now?

05:05.615 --> 05:06.992
Well, I am...

05:08.952 --> 05:10.287
not going there.

05:10.370 --> 05:13.539
Not this second, but...

05:13.623 --> 05:15.583
I can meet you there tomorrow.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.002
No. Never mind.

05:17.085 --> 05:20.463
I have to let my landlord know tonight.
So, it wasn't meant to be.

05:20.546 --> 05:23.967
- Or this afternoon?
- I'm working.

05:24.050 --> 05:25.885
- What time do you start?
- In, like, 30 minutes.

05:29.222 --> 05:30.765
Okay. Well, no time like the present.

05:30.849 --> 05:32.851
I guess I can meet you there
in 15 minutes.

05:32.934 --> 05:34.102
- Yeah?
- Sure. Yeah.

05:34.186 --> 05:35.728
- Thank you.
- Yup. Okay. I'll see you there.

05:35.812 --> 05:39.358
It's "Try." It's a furniture store
over on Abbott Kinney. Just down there.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.651
- Okay.
- Got three stools in the window.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.195
- Thanks.
- Can't miss it.

06:02.755 --> 06:05.591
What is he doing?
He's only got one coffee.

06:05.675 --> 06:07.468
What happened to my coffee?

06:08.220 --> 06:11.014
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Cooler.

06:11.097 --> 06:14.934
Hey, real quick, do you mind throwing
some of these in the window of your store?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.896
Uh... yeah, sure. What is this?

06:17.979 --> 06:20.232
It's "Save Venice."
A bunch of us are getting together

06:20.315 --> 06:22.817
to try to stop that developer
from building hotels and shit.

06:22.901 --> 06:25.111
- You know about that.
- Yeah, great. You know what? I'll do it.

06:25.195 --> 06:27.488
Cool. Hey, can I talk to you
for a quick minute?

06:27.572 --> 06:28.573
Not really, no.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.117
You don't notice anything different
about Dennis's dogs, by any chance?

06:31.201 --> 06:33.578
- Nope.
- I was walking them the other day,

06:33.661 --> 06:36.248
and we ran into this
little Jack Russell Terrier.

06:36.331 --> 06:39.584
It's yappy. For sure, it's yappy.
The little thing's got a cool vibe.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.420
Cooler, I really don't have time
for this, man.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.837
And then Pinot, out of nowhere, man,

06:42.921 --> 06:45.506
snatches this thing little up
right in his jaws

06:45.590 --> 06:47.633
and starts rag-dolling him around.

06:47.717 --> 06:49.552
- Fuck.
- Yeah. He was looking to kill it.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.721
At least eat it.

06:51.804 --> 06:54.933
So, I had to do the thing, man.

06:55.016 --> 06:57.518
I had to... I had to stick it in his ass.

06:57.602 --> 06:59.354
Stick what in his ass?

07:02.523 --> 07:05.318
I had to, man.
It was the only way he'd let go.

07:05.402 --> 07:08.571
- You digitally molested his dog?
- No. Only there.

07:08.654 --> 07:12.409
- Only up from there.
- Shit, man.

07:12.492 --> 07:15.661
Listen, Chip, you have
to tell Dennis for me.

07:15.745 --> 07:17.872
- Me?
- I can't tell him. He'll listen to you.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.919
You know what? You should...
you should go tell him right now.

07:23.002 --> 07:26.131
Come on, man.
That's Dennis and his dogs and me.

07:26.214 --> 07:28.758
No normal rules apply to that.

07:28.841 --> 07:32.595
I know, man, but I can't go tell him.
It's way too suspicious.

07:32.678 --> 07:34.806
Plus, you don't lawyer up
if you're innocent.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.392
- That's...
- Right. They never... right?

07:37.476 --> 07:39.185
- Yeah.
- I think you should tell him yourself.

07:39.269 --> 07:41.187
He's actually in the store right now.

07:41.271 --> 07:43.940
He's in a really good place.
He just had his coffee.

07:44.023 --> 07:45.024
- Thank you.
- Yeah, man.

07:45.108 --> 07:46.192
All right.

08:37.076 --> 08:41.164
It's a known move, Dennis.
I learned it in the Boy Scouts, man!

08:41.246 --> 08:43.207
Yeah, I bet you did!

08:44.750 --> 08:46.919
Hey, man. So, that went pretty good,
don't you think?

08:47.003 --> 08:49.339
Yeah, not bad.
Yeah. Good call, man. Thanks.

08:49.422 --> 08:51.466
- Yeah, you got it.
- Cool.

08:52.342 --> 08:55.136
Aw... That fucking guy.

09:23.582 --> 09:24.665
Hey!

09:25.958 --> 09:29.588
I must have walked past this place
a million times.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.006
How did you know I was looking
for an apartment?

09:32.090 --> 09:34.593
Uh, Dennis told me.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.554
Like, you guys tell each other
everything, huh?

09:37.637 --> 09:39.639
Oh yeah.

09:39.722 --> 09:41.307
Wait. How did Dennis know?

09:41.391 --> 09:43.435
Um, welcome to Venice.

09:49.482 --> 09:51.276
So...

09:54.362 --> 09:55.196
Yeah.

10:00.452 --> 10:02.703
It's not exactly cavernous.

10:03.996 --> 10:05.915
It could definitely use a coat of paint.

10:05.998 --> 10:08.918
I feel like that would
make it even smaller.

10:11.129 --> 10:15.049
Well... throw a lamp in here,
maybe a chair.

10:15.133 --> 10:17.051
- Yeah, no, the light's good.
- Yeah.

10:19.471 --> 10:22.765
Plus, I'm right downstairs
if you need anything at all.

10:22.848 --> 10:25.851
- Yeah, this is probably a bad idea.
- Yeah, it's a terrible idea.

10:25.935 --> 10:29.648
- But good to rule it out, though.
- Oh, yeah, no, I appreciate the offer.

10:29.730 --> 10:33.151
And it's here if you need it.
The apartment, that...

10:34.402 --> 10:35.403
- Yeah.
- That is...

10:37.697 --> 10:39.740
What the fuck are you doing?

10:41.576 --> 10:43.578
What the fuck are you doing?

10:54.130 --> 10:56.174
You must be sweating
this Jerry stuff.

10:56.257 --> 10:58.968
By "sweating," I mean fully avoiding it.

11:03.181 --> 11:05.766
I guess it's true what they say.
There are no secrets in Venice, huh?

11:05.850 --> 11:12.607
Policeman's dream. Everybody talks,
often to themselves, loud enough to hear.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.444
I'll have you know that I was actually
headed to see Jerry right now.

11:16.528 --> 11:18.697
- Uh-huh.
- Come on, man. Give me a break.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.700
I'll do better than that.
Let me give you a ride.

11:22.617 --> 11:23.909
Oh, man.

11:25.620 --> 11:28.540
Sorry I can't let you ride up front.
It's department policy.

11:28.623 --> 11:31.876
Plus, I got all of my gear.
Look, I get it, Chip, man. I do.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.919
I mean, you know,
you've been in that store a long time,

11:34.003 --> 11:36.506
and it's important to you, you know?

11:36.589 --> 11:38.883
And you're feeling pissed now, huh?
You're feeling betrayed,

11:38.966 --> 11:42.721
'cause he's cashing out
and leaving you by the curb, as it were.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.430
Yeah, if that's what he's doing.

11:45.724 --> 11:48.351
Look, I bet you feel
a little scared now, too, huh?

11:48.434 --> 11:51.020
You've got to go out there
and get yourself a real job.

11:51.688 --> 11:55.400
Come on, man. Don't give me that shit.
I've had plenty of real jobs in my life.

11:55.483 --> 11:58.444
What you going to be,
bagboy for Whole Foods, huh?

11:59.612 --> 12:01.740
That's good for your image.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.824
Dude, fuck you. "Image."

12:06.827 --> 12:10.623
Man, look, I got another take on this.
You want to hear it?

12:10.707 --> 12:13.167
Yeah, I can't wait.

12:13.251 --> 12:15.670
I think this is a good thing.

12:15.754 --> 12:19.549
The store, Jerry.
Nah, man, those are links to the past.

12:19.632 --> 12:22.927
It's time you got out of there.
Time to look forward now.

12:24.887 --> 12:27.473
All right, man.
This is as close as I can get you.

12:28.683 --> 12:29.850
I can't do this.

12:30.935 --> 12:34.980
Come on, man.
There's no time like the present.

12:35.064 --> 12:37.900
No, I mean there's no handle on it.
I can't do this door.

12:37.983 --> 12:39.569
Oh, yeah. All right,
I gotta let you out.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.912
What, you got a problem?

12:49.995 --> 12:54.250
No. I don't think so. It's just that...
I think I've seen that car before.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.629
Which one? The silver Honda Sedan?
Mid-size, no distinguishing features?

12:57.712 --> 12:59.505
Yeah. Have you noticed it?

12:59.589 --> 13:00.757
Obviously, I haven't paid
enough attention,

13:00.840 --> 13:03.217
but if you want, I can run
the license plates for you.

13:03.301 --> 13:06.887
- Yeah?
- Of course not, fuckhead.

13:10.516 --> 13:11.810
Thanks for the ride.

13:56.771 --> 13:57.730
Dennis!

14:00.358 --> 14:01.442
Denny!

14:57.874 --> 14:59.291
Hey.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.252
That was lame.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.505
Oh, yeah. Cooler's comedy night.
Well, I warned you.

15:04.589 --> 15:06.841
No, that was lame of you
not to fucking show up.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.178
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. I got slammed...

15:11.262 --> 15:13.848
I would have called,
but you know I don't have a phone.

15:13.932 --> 15:18.102
- You have a phone at work.
- Yeah, but it's a work phone.

15:21.230 --> 15:24.275
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

15:24.358 --> 15:30.072
You didn't. I just... whatever.
I just... I just felt stupid, that's all.

15:32.867 --> 15:36.370
- What are we doing here?
- Just making stools for people to sit on.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.293
Just be a gentleman.

15:49.550 --> 15:50.802
Kara got a new haircut?

15:52.470 --> 15:53.888
Good for her.

15:59.978 --> 16:02.814
I can't believe Cooler told you.

16:02.897 --> 16:05.107
Look, man, I think he was worried
that you might overreact.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.692
He finger-raped Pinot!

16:06.776 --> 16:08.319
Like that.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.362
I had to take the dogs
to the V.D. clinic.

16:10.446 --> 16:12.698
Dude, I'm not sure
you can get V.D. off a finger.

16:12.782 --> 16:14.700
The Venice Dog Clinic.

16:15.660 --> 16:18.245
Look, man, at least he had the guts
to come and tell you.

16:18.329 --> 16:22.708
I just... I don't... I can't...
I don't want to talk about this.

16:24.543 --> 16:26.211
So, did you go see Jerry?

16:26.295 --> 16:30.925
You know, for a guy who does nothing
but sit around and smoke weed all day,

16:31.009 --> 16:33.594
he is... he is tough to find.

16:33.678 --> 16:36.931
He's like Osama bin Laden or something.

16:37.015 --> 16:38.683
Yeah, but we found Osama bin Laden.

16:38.766 --> 16:41.477
- Yeah, I guess.
- No, no. We did and we killed him.

16:42.061 --> 16:43.354
"We"?

16:43.437 --> 16:44.730
- "They."
- Yeah.

16:44.814 --> 16:47.316
That gives me hope.

16:51.529 --> 16:52.989
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:53.072 --> 16:54.198
Um...

16:54.281 --> 16:58.536
I decided to take you up on that offer,
if it's still open.

16:59.954 --> 17:00.872
Um...

17:00.955 --> 17:05.084
Yes, it is. Definitely. Good decision.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.045
Great. Can I bring these
up to the apartment?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.713
Yep. Absolutely.

17:08.796 --> 17:11.339
- Hi, Dennis.
- Hey...

17:16.054 --> 17:18.180
- What the fuck, man?
- Look, man...

17:18.262 --> 17:19.515
- Are you for real?
- Dennis...

17:19.598 --> 17:22.601
What part of "swoop"
do you not understand?

17:22.685 --> 17:24.729
Come on. It's not what it looks like.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.022
It looks like she's moving
into your studio.

17:27.106 --> 17:28.357
It's short term.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.484
That's because Jerry's selling
the fucking building.

17:30.568 --> 17:33.362
- We don't know that.
- That's because you won't talk to Jerry.

17:33.445 --> 17:34.697
I did go. I went to see...

17:37.366 --> 17:39.118
I just... I have a couple more things.

17:39.827 --> 17:42.413
- Oh, here. Let me help you.
- Let me help you. I got it.

17:42.496 --> 17:43.748
- Thanks.
- No, here. Let me help you. I got it.

17:43.831 --> 17:46.000
- No, it's good. I got it.
- I got it.

17:48.127 --> 17:51.255
- I was just being of service, man.
- Yeah. Some room service.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.340
Come on, man.
She's not even part of the program.

17:53.424 --> 17:56.552
Yeah, I know,
but I ran into her at Free Coffee,

17:56.635 --> 17:59.346
and I wouldn't have even been there
if you hadn't been so fucking cheap.

17:59.430 --> 18:00.264
Okay.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.391
It could have been you.
You could have been the one.

18:02.474 --> 18:05.728
I'd be the one to ask her to move
into your studio? Why would I do that?

18:05.811 --> 18:07.521
Because this puts her right
in our wheelhouse.

18:07.605 --> 18:09.857
- "Our" wheelhouse?
- "Your" wheelhouse.

18:09.941 --> 18:12.777
- You're gonna see her, like, every day.
- Yeah, at your place.

18:12.860 --> 18:16.238
Jesus, I'm not even interested in her.
Could you just let it go?

18:16.321 --> 18:19.992
Let it go, huh? What, are you going
to put a finger in my ass?

18:20.076 --> 18:21.535
Dude...

18:21.619 --> 18:22.954
Hey. How you guys doing?

18:23.037 --> 18:26.415
Good. Yeah, no, we're good.
Dennis just needed to take a break.

18:26.498 --> 18:27.875
Okay, cool. Thank you.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.043
Sure.

18:30.711 --> 18:33.464
I know what you're doing, man.
I know what you're doing.

18:33.547 --> 18:37.342
You want me to fly in there,
all unprepared, and fall flat on my face,

18:37.426 --> 18:40.471
while you just swoop in after,
totally in the clear.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.056
No, no. Dude, no.

18:42.140 --> 18:44.976
That is the sort of negative attitude
that I'm trying to rid you of.

18:45.059 --> 18:47.853
Yeah. So, you want me
to just go in there and ask her out?

18:47.937 --> 18:50.606
- No time like the present.
- Okay, man. I'm just gonna ask her out.

18:50.689 --> 18:51.899
Great. I don't think you will.

18:51.983 --> 18:53.818
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm going to do it.

18:53.901 --> 18:55.027
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:55.778 --> 18:58.530
And if it's not meant to be,
then it's not meant to be.

18:58.614 --> 19:01.033
Can't believe you asked her out.

19:01.117 --> 19:03.243
I can't believe she said "yes."

19:04.578 --> 19:06.122
Well, I knew she would.

19:07.498 --> 19:08.791
Congratulations.

19:08.874 --> 19:12.837
Yeah, yeah. Thanks, man. It turns out
that she actually knows me from before.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.131
She spotted me playing paddle
about a month or so ago.

19:15.464 --> 19:16.715
- Huh.
- Yeah.

19:16.799 --> 19:18.759
It was right after I did
the master cleanse.

19:18.843 --> 19:20.886
So, I was looking good.

19:21.220 --> 19:24.264
- You would have been playing with me.
- Yeah, but it was me that she spotted.

19:24.348 --> 19:28.435
And it was me that she just asked
to give the lowdown on Venice.

19:35.109 --> 19:36.819
I'm sorry. She asked you?

19:36.902 --> 19:39.571
Well, no. No, I mean, I told her
that I knew about all the cool spots,

19:39.655 --> 19:43.450
and I said that if she wanted me
to show her around, I could do it.

19:43.534 --> 19:47.997
So, is it a date or are you showing her
the places that people go on dates?

19:48.122 --> 19:51.125
- It's like a rendezvous.
- So, not a date?

19:51.209 --> 19:54.879
It's going to turn into a date,
you know? This is what I do.

19:54.962 --> 19:58.049
I ask them out and we just
kind of hang, all casual like,

19:58.132 --> 20:01.219
and then, we transition
into a full blown date.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.387
I think full blown's a little optimistic.

20:04.763 --> 20:06.015
It's a good plan.

20:06.098 --> 20:11.103
You do have a lot of girl friends
who never transition into "girlfriends."

20:11.187 --> 20:13.605
Well, yeah, but I got this, okay?

20:13.689 --> 20:16.650
I got the perfect bottle of wine.
We're going to watch a beautiful sunset.

20:16.734 --> 20:19.028
She's going to drink this.
And then, I'm going to call an Uber.

20:19.987 --> 20:23.448
For the transition. Uber guy's
going to say, "One stop or two?"

20:23.532 --> 20:25.576
Which is basically like saying,
"Your place or mine?"

20:25.659 --> 20:28.037
Except I don't have to say anything.

20:29.121 --> 20:33.542
- Sounds like you got it all figured out.
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

20:33.625 --> 20:35.169
I feel confident.

20:37.588 --> 20:39.339
That's her. That's her!
She thinks it's a date.

20:39.423 --> 20:41.842
She's going to cancel.
Shit! Fuck me!

20:42.509 --> 20:44.762
I knew she would.

20:44.845 --> 20:46.388
It's Carmichael. Shit!

20:46.471 --> 20:48.266
Fuck!
He was going to sit the dogs

20:48.348 --> 20:51.227
because you-know-who
is out of the equation.

20:51.310 --> 20:55.022
I... I don't know who else to call.

20:56.481 --> 20:59.526
- Well, can't they just be here?
- After the day that they've had?

20:59.610 --> 21:01.862
No, I'm not going to leave them alone.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.451
- Okay, I guess I could step in.
- Yes! Buddy, thank you.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.871
- Thank you so much.
- Just tell me what to do.

21:11.747 --> 21:14.499
Oh, what time does the sun set?
Oh, and should I pick her up?

21:14.583 --> 21:17.044
Or is she going to meet me there?

21:17.128 --> 21:19.088
And what is an Uber?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.884
You mean to look after the dogs?

21:25.427 --> 21:27.096
Sorry. Of course.

21:36.521 --> 21:39.191
I heard that
you were going to split town.

21:39.275 --> 21:43.112
Yeah. No, I was,
but I didn't, obviously.

21:43.195 --> 21:44.696
Yeah. No, obviously.

21:45.614 --> 21:47.908
Not a lot of secrets
in Venice, huh?

21:47.992 --> 21:50.202
- Yeah.
- Nice.

21:50.286 --> 21:53.247
- Uh-huh. Great.
- Cool. Yeah.

21:53.331 --> 21:56.041
What...
so, what made you stay?

21:56.125 --> 21:58.794
Doesn't matter where you go,
right? There you are.

21:58.877 --> 22:01.172
Yeah.
That's like Chip says.

22:01.255 --> 22:02.422
There's no such thing

22:02.506 --> 22:05.343
as a geographical solution
to your problems.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.303
- Chip says that?
- Well, yeah.

22:07.386 --> 22:10.848
I guess a lot of people say that,
but Chip more than most.

22:10.931 --> 22:13.851
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, nothing.

22:17.729 --> 22:20.983
You can open a bottle of wine
with your belt buckle?

22:22.860 --> 22:24.444
Apparently not.

23:13.744 --> 23:17.539
You just woke me up
from a really intense dream.

23:18.623 --> 23:22.711
- Okay. Well, look, I just...
- Yeah. In fact, I was in here.

23:25.214 --> 23:28.008
- I was looking for something.
- Well, what is it?

23:28.092 --> 23:33.305
Now I think about it, I haven't seen
my chameleon for quite some time.

23:33.389 --> 23:36.058
Didn't you once eat a chameleon,
like, on a salad or something?

23:36.141 --> 23:38.643
Yeah, I thought he was arugula.

23:38.727 --> 23:43.065
You know, I thought I saw him
over here, blending in, like...

23:45.443 --> 23:47.319
Do you have something
that you want to tell me?

23:51.365 --> 23:57.996
If I just had a dream
I was doing exactly this...

23:58.122 --> 24:01.917
how do I know
I'm not still in the dream?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.044
Well, you're not, Jerry. I promise.

24:04.128 --> 24:05.587
Okay. That's good enough.

24:05.670 --> 24:09.549
- How's that?
- No one ever makes a promise in a dream.

24:12.052 --> 24:13.011
Hey.

24:13.929 --> 24:15.555
Hey.

24:15.639 --> 24:17.182
Are you selling the building?

24:19.559 --> 24:20.727
I don't know.

24:20.811 --> 24:23.481
What the hell does that mean?

24:23.563 --> 24:25.607
Chip, come on.

24:25.690 --> 24:29.278
Look... we, you and me...

24:29.361 --> 24:32.531
we see way above
all the B.S. out there.

24:32.614 --> 24:37.244
It's, like, literally that...
like, there's a baseline truth.

24:37.328 --> 24:38.829
Reality.

24:39.037 --> 24:44.001
And then, there's all of these layers
and layers and layers of bullshit,

24:44.084 --> 24:45.294
and it just sits there.

24:45.377 --> 24:48.380
It's like a mountain village that...

24:48.464 --> 24:50.924
rocks cascade down the mountain.

24:51.008 --> 24:55.095
Mud. Mud everywhere,
overruns the whole village.

24:55.179 --> 24:57.764
But guys like you and me,

24:57.848 --> 25:02.311
we've got these special glasses,
3D glasses.

25:02.394 --> 25:05.272
And they see through...
they see through...

25:05.356 --> 25:08.900
- Mud.
- They see through the mud.

25:10.819 --> 25:12.196
I need that store, Jerry.

25:15.032 --> 25:18.660
I'm not sure I'd know what to do
if I lost it, man. That store is me.

25:18.743 --> 25:21.288
You... are you.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.832
Wherever you are.

25:23.915 --> 25:25.584
And that's a great thing.

25:25.667 --> 25:28.712
You should be excited to find that out.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.630
It's great news.

25:38.013 --> 25:43.268
Hey, listen, all mud aside...
how much are you asking for that building?

25:43.352 --> 25:45.437
Four million dollars.

25:46.564 --> 25:47.772
Cash?

25:47.856 --> 25:50.568
I'll take a check,
but what does that matter to you?

25:50.650 --> 25:51.651
It's just that four million dollars

25:51.735 --> 25:53.737
was a little bit more
than I was looking to spend.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.406
Chip, I don't mean
to sound like an asshole,

25:55.489 --> 25:58.242
but I could give you ten years,
and you...

25:58.325 --> 26:01.620
you couldn't come close
to making four million dollars.

26:01.703 --> 26:03.288
So you're telling me I got ten years?

26:03.372 --> 26:06.708
No, I'm telling you
you don't have four million dollars.

26:14.508 --> 26:17.344
I may not have
four million dollars today...

26:19.179 --> 26:20.639
Yeah?

26:21.932 --> 26:24.684
No, that was it. I was finished.

26:30.608 --> 26:32.443
- Getting kind of late.
- Yeah.

26:32.526 --> 26:35.946
- I should get us an Uber.
- Oh, I have my bike, so...

26:36.029 --> 26:37.114
Oh.

26:38.198 --> 26:40.158
- Is that Chip?
- No.

26:41.868 --> 26:45.414
Hey. Hey! What the fuck
is this thing doing on Pinot?

26:45.497 --> 26:48.292
- I found that muzzle you got him.
- Yeah, he doesn't like it.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.335
- He seems to like it just fine.
- Are these your dogs?

26:50.419 --> 26:54.172
Yeah. Oh, well,
they really seem to like you.

26:54.256 --> 26:55.466
You'd know if they didn't.

26:55.549 --> 26:57.801
What have you got this silly thing on for?

26:57.884 --> 27:00.304
- What the fuck are you doing here, man?
- Hey, I just...

27:00.387 --> 27:03.890
- These guys smell like weed.
- Fucking Jerry, man.

27:03.974 --> 27:05.725
- You talked to Jerry?
- Yeah.

27:06.768 --> 27:10.314
Hey, you... you don't happen to have
a corkscrew on you, do you?

27:10.397 --> 27:16.320
Me? No. No, I don't... that's... he does.
We do at our house, but not...

27:16.403 --> 27:18.280
Should we go get it?
We could bring the dogs.

27:18.363 --> 27:21.783
We should go... yes.
You know, that's a great idea.

27:21.866 --> 27:24.119
- We should go get a...
- Do you mind?

27:24.202 --> 27:26.955
No. Not at all. That...
Here, take that.

27:27.038 --> 27:28.999
- Thank you.
- You might want the air horn.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.168
No, I'm good. Thanks.

27:32.169 --> 27:35.130
- Thank you so much.
- For what?

27:35.213 --> 27:36.423
The transition.

27:36.507 --> 27:39.092
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, man.
Yeah. That's good. Go get it.

27:39.176 --> 27:41.386
- Good night, Chip.
- Good night.

27:42.137 --> 27:45.974
