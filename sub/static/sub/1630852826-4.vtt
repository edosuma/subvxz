00:12.637 --> 00:15.473


00:22.439 --> 00:24.566
-Let's cheers.
-Thank you.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.361
-Oh, let me get yours first, actually.
-Thank you.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.279
Yeah.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.116
-My God, it's so fucking hot.
-I know.

00:33.616 --> 00:37.746
-All right, we'll go straight back inside.
-Sorry, I'm awkward sometimes in person.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.081
No, it's all good. Yeah.

00:40.165 --> 00:43.168
I was wondering if that was going on
when we first saw each other.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.336
Yeah.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.758
Coming into Mexico,
I was a little worried just because, um,

00:49.841 --> 00:53.261
like, at the reveal, I definitely…

00:53.344 --> 00:55.805
You know, I was in my head.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.974
So, I think just letting him know

00:59.142 --> 01:02.187
I reacted this way
because this is not easy for me,

01:02.270 --> 01:06.733
but it has nothing to do
with who you are or how I feel about you.

01:07.734 --> 01:11.863
I'm extremely attracted to him,
so I never want him to think that I'm not.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.948
I am very, like…

01:14.949 --> 01:18.953
-I can be very awkward and…
-I'll be awkward with you. I don't care.

01:19.037 --> 01:22.373
I'm just… I'm a quirk…
I'm just sometimes quirky

01:22.457 --> 01:24.959
and a little awkward in person.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.879
It's a lot.
I want you to feel comfortable.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.005
-Okay? I don't--
-Yeah.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.717
And, honestly, Mal, like,
I know this is really, really different.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.304
Something that you…
There's really nothing to compare it to.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.640
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-So, I get that. Okay?

01:38.723 --> 01:40.308
Well, I appreciate you for that.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.602
But I just wanna say
it has nothing to do with you.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.645
I understand.

01:43.728 --> 01:47.565
I had a lot going on through my head too,
when I first saw her.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.151
And I think I was kind of taken aback by…

01:50.235 --> 01:53.404
I don't know. Like, it was…
It was just… It was just weird.

01:53.488 --> 01:57.033
I was thinking about that a lot.
I felt like our kiss was a little bit…

01:57.742 --> 02:01.996
I felt like it was missing something,
but I didn't take into perspective

02:02.080 --> 02:03.498
how Mallory was feeling.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.709
I just want you to know
that I'm going through this with you too.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.504
-Yeah. I appreciate that.
-And, like… Yeah.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.506
I told you in the pods
and telling you now,

02:11.589 --> 02:14.259
this is a safe space
and always will be a safe space. Okay?

02:14.342 --> 02:17.762
-So…
-Thank you. You're so sweet.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.223
-And you look beautiful.
-Thanks.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.933
-You look so handsome.
-Thank you.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.561
-You're so handsome.
-Man… Get outta here.

02:24.644 --> 02:28.148
-My God. How cute you are!
-Get outta here. All right.

02:29.858 --> 02:30.900
You're so cute!

02:30.984 --> 02:33.027
-Cheers.
-To our first time in Mexico.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.321
-To our first time in Mexico.
-Cheers.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.159
Hmm!

02:39.784 --> 02:43.037
So, who is this <i>encarnac--?</i>

02:43.663 --> 02:46.124
Oh my God. You better stop.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.104
So, what was your first impression
when you seen't me?

03:08.188 --> 03:11.566
-"Seen't me"? When you seen't me?
-Yeah, when you saw me.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.069
I was like, "Fuck, he's tall."
I said, "Fuck!"

03:15.153 --> 03:17.947
It's not what I wanted,
but it's fine. I'll take it.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.073
-For real?
-Yeah.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.243
I was overthinking our height difference.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.454
-Like, it was bad.
-It's not that…

03:24.537 --> 03:26.623
I mean, like, a whole 11 inches.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.792
I kept saying,
"I'm gonna have to wear heels during sex."

03:29.876 --> 03:32.754
-You don't…
-Thank you.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.466
Jarrette is fucking huge.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.010
He's taller than I typically want,

03:39.093 --> 03:42.472
but I will adjust
to the fact that he's 6'1,

03:42.555 --> 03:46.017
and maybe I'll have back problems
by the age of 30, but it's fine.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.938
He's still him and I love his personality.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.064
Oh!

03:51.147 --> 03:52.732
-What?
-Excuse me.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.442
-What?
-I got you something.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.444
-What did you get me?
-I got you something.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.238
-You got <i>me</i> something?
-Yes.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.864
-Me?
-Yeah.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.157
What'd you get me?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.284
What's--

04:03.368 --> 04:06.079
-A fucking Polaroid camera!

04:06.162 --> 04:07.872
Oh my God!

04:08.373 --> 04:09.874
Are you serious?!

04:09.958 --> 04:13.753
Oh, you don't know how excited I--
You don't know how much this means to me.

04:13.836 --> 04:17.173
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Please tell me you have…

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
-Yes.
-I'm gonna lose my shit!

04:19.342 --> 04:22.262
-Okay, I'm okay. I'm okay.
-I love cameras. All right.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.807
-Oh my God!

04:25.890 --> 04:28.268
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.188
The first pack of film,
that's for the raunchy photos.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.732
-Raunchy? Are we taking raunchy photos?
-Rawr.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.276
-Listen…
-Know what? I'm down.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.152
I'm not even gonna lie. I'm down.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.738
-Gummi Bear.
-Smile for the camera. Really?

04:42.573 --> 04:45.285
-I like that one.
-You're so cute.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.959
-It is warm.
-Yeah, so it is.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.168
Oh my God. Warm as hell.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.546
I thought I was gonna be too short.
Like, "Oh God!"

04:56.629 --> 05:00.049
-I was talking about the sun…
-This is nice. Didn't wanna get…

05:01.634 --> 05:03.177
-Are you cold?
-I'm cold.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.888
-I feel good.
-Ooh, this shit is…

05:05.972 --> 05:06.931
I'm on my knees.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.267
Look at you.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.823
-Girl, you be like, "Dang."
-Mm-hmm.

05:27.493 --> 05:31.664
Being with him, I feel really comfortable.
I feel protected.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.501
I want to wait until we're married
to actually have sex,

05:35.585 --> 05:38.629
but I'm very attracted to him,
so I'm like, "Fuck."

05:41.841 --> 05:45.678
<i>5</i>

06:07.283 --> 06:10.912
Being here, physically, with Shake,
and bonding in this way,

06:10.995 --> 06:13.206
has definitely enhanced
my feelings for him.

06:13.289 --> 06:17.377
When we started off this experience,
Shake placed so much importance

06:17.460 --> 06:20.338
on the physical aspect
of the relationship.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.216
And to me that was, like, really tough,

06:23.299 --> 06:26.636
because when I was heavier,
I didn't even love myself.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.681
And this is the first time
he's seeing me in a bikini. It's like,

06:30.765 --> 06:34.352
will he find me that attractive?
Will we have that physical connection?

06:35.103 --> 06:38.022
But we definitely have
that physical chemistry.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.400
I'm so happy. I'm very happy.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.403
-Yes! Yes!

06:44.570 --> 06:45.446
Come on in.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.656
Oh boy.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.327
Nice.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.621
Come in here. Come here.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.475
-Sure is nice.
-It feels so great out here.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.810
-It feels amazing.
-Love it.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.148
You got the wet hair look.
Did you wanna hump?

07:27.488 --> 07:29.949
-I think we're good together.
-You're kind of tiny.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.617
Kind of a tiny woman.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.206
I think our babies are gonna be
so cute and smart.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.584
-Yeah.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.963
I think we're both ready
to commit to each other.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.424
-And I'm excited to just…
-What?

07:46.507 --> 07:49.594
-Connect with you on all these levels.
-Yeah.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.721
All these levels. Mm-hmm.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.683
Do you just wanna get married
and just say fuck it?

07:56.934 --> 07:58.644
-I, uh…

08:00.062 --> 08:02.523
-We have the rest of our lives.
-Yeah.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.233
-Right. Yeah.
-Isn't that crazy?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.903
-Are you excited? Are you happy?
-I'm very happy.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.904
-Are you?
-Yeah.

08:07.987 --> 08:14.160
But right now, I'm also just trying
to take it… one hour at a time.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.661
One hour at a time?

08:15.745 --> 08:16.621
Yeah.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.333
Are you excited to marry?

08:21.292 --> 08:23.419
Yep. I'm on-- I'm on-- I'm on my way.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.213
Definitely on my way.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.256
-Organic and natural, baby.
-Mm-hmm.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.093
It's all organic and natural, right?

08:31.177 --> 08:34.972
First night together, honestly,
feelin' a little apprehensive

08:35.056 --> 08:38.684
spending that physical time
touching one another,

08:38.768 --> 08:40.311
and I don't know if I'm feeling

08:40.394 --> 08:42.980
the type of body connection
that I wanted to feel.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.233
There's things that I said, like,

08:45.316 --> 08:48.528
"We're gonna get married,
gonna have babies," and stuff like that,

08:48.611 --> 08:52.782
and hearing that back from Deeps,

08:52.865 --> 08:55.409
at times, it feels amazing to hear that,

08:55.493 --> 08:57.662
but then at times, it feels really scary.

08:57.745 --> 09:01.624
There's, like… just moments
where I'm like, "Oh my God."

09:02.291 --> 09:06.546
Maybe this is a little commitment phobia
rearing its head.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.382
Shouldn't be a huge deal.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.262
It'll be hard
to keep it PG-13 with you.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.305
-You think so? Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.276
Have a side you like sleeping on?

09:28.359 --> 09:29.360
I like this side.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.153
-Do you?
-Yeah. Do you like this side?

09:31.237 --> 09:34.699
Whatever. I'm a man of many things.
We can do a lot of things differently.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.660
I know about Shayne's nighttime routine.

09:37.743 --> 09:42.123
He sleeps with the TV and eats in bed,
and that's my worst nightmare.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.918
So, um, we're gonna have
to figure that out tonight.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.922
You think I'll ever eat in my bed?
Look at me. Nothing touches my bed.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.465
I have white sheets at home.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.802
-I love this ring so much.
-I know. Me too.

09:55.303 --> 09:58.139
I'm so glad you chose it.
It's my favorite.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.183
That makes me so happy. Here.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.603
Oh yeah, baby.

10:03.686 --> 10:07.148
If I'm being honest,
I like a late-night snack

10:07.231 --> 10:08.399
once in a while.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.746
It takes me usually months
to gain physical connection

10:21.829 --> 10:25.041
with other guys, because
I'm scared for them to see me naked.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.461
But Nick, every single time
that I'm around him,

10:28.544 --> 10:31.881
I feel myself. And I feel
more confident than I ever have.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.090
Like, I'm so happy.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.134
I am.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.386
I'm, like, so happy.

10:46.812 --> 10:51.192
Luckiest guy in the world.
It's a big world. I'm the luckiest.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.380
So, I'm here in paradise by myself,

11:13.089 --> 11:15.091
and it's not the same

11:16.425 --> 11:17.802
without Shaina.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.888
The fact that she's not here
makes me so upset.

11:21.472 --> 11:26.644
Shaina wasn't sure about me

11:26.727 --> 11:27.978
after the proposal.

11:28.062 --> 11:32.066
I know she wasn't, but I think
I can change her mind about me.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.821
Last night, I was taken aback.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.199
Shaina decided that she should
just end our trip early

11:40.282 --> 11:41.450
and go home.

11:45.329 --> 11:49.625
I need better communication from Shaina.
She's a horrible communicator.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.461
It's like, well,
how do I even know you're alive?

11:52.962 --> 11:56.507
I'm a little worried.
I'm gonna have to adjust

11:57.800 --> 12:02.972
a lot, I think, in order for us
to move forward with our relationship.

12:03.055 --> 12:07.810
Eventually, I'll get more confident
physically around her. I'll grow on her.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.772
Shaina is gonna be
madly in love with me at the end of it.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.024
Ready to get married.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.705
I don't wanna get up.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.752
-Get off of me.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.337
You take up too much of the bed, bro.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.964
Look at this.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.760
-Look at all…
-Oh, shit, you really don't have no space.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.886
My gosh.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.095
I'm sorry.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.723
-It's a bad first night impression.
-Shut up.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.684
I'm waking up next to my fiancée
and it's the first time

12:48.768 --> 12:51.645
I've actually been able to hold her
while she was sleeping.

12:51.729 --> 12:55.274
I was sitting there looking at her like,
"Man, this girl is so beautiful."

12:55.357 --> 12:58.652
That physical connection we have
is as strong as our emotional connection

12:58.736 --> 13:00.446
and it's only been one day.

13:00.529 --> 13:04.116
I can kinda get used to this.
You was cool at cuddling.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.452
-I like cuddling with you.
-'Cause…

13:06.535 --> 13:08.412
At first, I was like, "He's so big!"

13:08.496 --> 13:10.456
-"What the fuck?"
-He's so what?

13:10.539 --> 13:11.874
Man, shut up!

13:13.250 --> 13:16.796
It's nice to wake up to somebody.
It's nice to cuddle again.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.256
I feel like I've known him
for at least two years.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.591
It's so weird, right?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.511
This is what I wanted.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.639
This is just… It's just what I wanted.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.433
Yep.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.769
Whoo!

13:37.441 --> 13:38.943
Want me to sing to you?

13:39.026 --> 13:42.530
I don't think that'd help.
I feel like absolute trash.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.158
-Drink your electrolytes.
-Yeah.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.952
-Little sips.
-I'm trying.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.037
Do you want more bread, or toast?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.998
No, I ate one bite of bread,
and threw it up immediately.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.127
I just feel bad.
I can't even drink the water.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.839
You think you could be pregnant?
No, I'm kidding…

13:59.922 --> 14:01.549
I'm pregnant already.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.677
Can you imagine?
"We're gonna wait five years."

14:04.760 --> 14:06.720
-Discussed in the pods.
-Yeah, for sure--

14:06.804 --> 14:09.557
This would be karma,
because I was making bets

14:09.640 --> 14:11.934
on who would get pregnant on the trip.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.812
-And it was never us.
-Lemme tell you. You were…

14:15.646 --> 14:18.774
Last night was awesome.
Danielle is amazing.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.778
I love her and…
…we're physical.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.738
It's… That works too.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.242
Twice, in three different places.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.245
-Did we even eat last night?
-We ate a lot.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.123
-Right. We ordered two dinners.
-I ate a lot.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.458
Yeah. That really did me in.

14:36.959 --> 14:40.880
It's in the harder times
when you realize how good people are,

14:40.963 --> 14:43.465
and the fact that he's patient,
he's not acting upset

14:43.549 --> 14:46.552
that I'm ruining a day
of our vacation. That's huge.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.387
I appreciate that.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.473
What is this, our third day? Second day.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.601
-Yeah, this is the third day…
-Third day now.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.395
This is the third day
we've known each other in real life.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.690
-…in person and here I am.
-And here you are at your absolute worst.

14:59.773 --> 15:04.361
-It's terrible. This is terrible.
-And I haven't run for the hills yet.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.616
-So, that's good. That's good.
-You've still got time. Still got time.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.377
Good morning. Did you sleep okay?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.547
Not really. You were making
puppy noises all night.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.593
-I…
-It was cute, though.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.428
Okay. And that kept you up?

15:29.511 --> 15:32.514
No, I was just tossing and turning.

15:32.598 --> 15:37.102
It's crazy that we're engaged.
I'm with you. This is wild.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.938
It is crazy. Yeah.

15:42.900 --> 15:47.321
We kept things PG last night.
Just a lot of cuddling, lots of talking,

15:47.404 --> 15:49.907
and we're not ready to take that step yet.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.037
Is it weird waking up next to me?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.914
Gonna take some getting used to.

15:57.414 --> 16:00.626
Uh, just being together
in real life, I think.

16:00.709 --> 16:01.710
Yeah.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.673
I mean, I'm glad that we're taking things
a little bit slower.

16:05.756 --> 16:11.053
I think it's taking more getting used to
to me than I initially thought.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.013
Mm-hmm. There's no need to rush it.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.808
I think Deeps is really awesome.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.686
Personality-wise, ten out of ten.

16:18.769 --> 16:23.232
Probably eleven out of ten,
but… I don't know.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.067
All right, it's time for coffee.

16:25.609 --> 16:26.527
Go.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.451
In the pods, we had an amazing connection,
but it's a purely emotional one,

16:34.952 --> 16:37.579
and waking up…
I don't know, it's hard to deny

16:37.663 --> 16:41.750
that I don't really feel
that kind of animalistic attraction.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.294
And, obviously,

16:44.378 --> 16:46.839
you don't judge a relationship
by just one factor.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.050
It's several, several different factors.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.344
And so many of these factors are

16:53.595 --> 16:57.016
so high in-- you know, in compatibility,

16:57.516 --> 17:00.144
that I don't want to overthink

17:00.936 --> 17:03.272
this one that isn't.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.816
But that's just something
I have to figure out right now.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.484
-Yes.
-Here we are. Look at this.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.863
-On this huge bed, put it right there.
-Wait. Okay, just don't spill.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.532
Yeah. What have we got here? Nice.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.286
I just need a straight IV tube of coffee.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.580
-How'd you sleep?
-Good.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.248
-Yeah?
-How did you sleep?

17:21.331 --> 17:23.584
If I hear three alarms
go off every morning,

17:24.626 --> 17:27.004
there'll be a divorce
happening pretty quickly.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.299
Fuck you.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.387
-It only went off twice. I know it did.
-No, it went off three times.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.766
-How do you know? Were you counting?
-Yes, I was counting in my head.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.309
-Wait, you were?
-Yes.

17:40.392 --> 17:44.063
Well, just get used to it.
It's gonna be like that every day.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.106
"I wanna wake up early," and then…

17:46.190 --> 17:47.024
"Beep."

17:47.107 --> 17:49.735
Ten minutes later… "Beep."
Ten minutes later… "Beep."

17:49.818 --> 17:51.528
And I'm like, "Oh my God. I…"

17:51.612 --> 17:54.156
I know, and I was like, "I don't snooze…"

17:54.656 --> 17:58.744
You said you don't snooze,
yet you fucking click it three times

17:58.827 --> 18:01.497
the first night together.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.749
I didn't realize I was hitting the snooze…

18:03.832 --> 18:05.918
You what?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.380
-Ew.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.007
I'm just kidding.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
You know what? You're acting like a…

18:15.719 --> 18:17.763
I think you're really hot.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.182
-Like, temperature-wise.
-Oh, thanks.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.019
I had a lot of fun
with Shayne last night. We just…

18:27.731 --> 18:28.565
You know.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.195
Enjoyed each other's company.

18:33.278 --> 18:37.199
-What time did we fall asleep last night?
-It was late, like 12:30.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.244
We could've knocked boots
a little longer, but…

18:40.327 --> 18:42.663
-What's that mean?
-You've never heard that saying?

18:42.746 --> 18:46.458
-No.
-It's… Never mind.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.294
We explored
each other's bodies well last night.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.880
I didn't expect that from her.
She's a little sassy.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.799
Threw me a few curveballs. It was fun.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.968
-We slept well together.
-Yeah, we did well.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.053
You did call my elbow pointy.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.389
Well, you did sleep like this too.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.767
You were modeling off your body
in the middle of the night too.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.938
I can't get close
because your elbow's like a knife.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.731
I don't know if you felt it,

19:09.815 --> 19:12.943
but I was trying to get my feet
in between yours for body heat,

19:13.026 --> 19:15.112
but your subconscious state
was not feeling it.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.243
Good morning.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.121
Good morning.
How are you feeling?

19:24.621 --> 19:26.540
-How are you?

19:27.499 --> 19:28.375
Stop.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.631
I had a lot of fun.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.717
-Yeah, I feel good.
-Yeah.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.468
Yeah.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.220
Last night was a lot of fun.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.265
I was super nervous and awkward at first,

19:43.348 --> 19:46.768
but then, yeah, we just… Um, you know.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.479
We… We were having a good time.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.441
I don't kiss and tell, but…

19:52.524 --> 19:55.861
You know, he's…
he's pretty suave, for sure.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.990
I don't know. I feel like just to be
on the safe side, you know, I would…

20:00.657 --> 20:03.577
It would ease my mind
probably to stop at the pharmacy.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.204
Um…

20:05.287 --> 20:07.789
Does this get in your way
when you're sleeping?

20:07.873 --> 20:11.335
No, it's definitely something
you get used to.

20:11.418 --> 20:15.088
-This hand is so much heavier.
-Stop it.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.008
-I'm just kidding.
-Oh God. What?

20:18.675 --> 20:22.221
-I did hear you snoring yesterday.
-Oh my God. You're full of shit.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.264
No, I mean it.

20:24.348 --> 20:28.143
-I wouldn't lie about that.
-Be quiet.

20:29.770 --> 20:34.024
Sometimes I do,
occasionally, but not a lot.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.110
We have
the whole day to ourselves. So,

20:37.194 --> 20:38.779
we could go to the beach,

20:38.862 --> 20:43.200
or we could just go explore
the resort a little bit.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.035
-All right…
-Look at you.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.703
-You're so cute.
-What? What?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.134
Ready for these hands…

21:01.218 --> 21:03.762
-You don't have feminine hands.
-…to be all up on you?

21:03.845 --> 21:06.265
You wasn't expecting
the full body massage, huh?

21:06.348 --> 21:09.142
The fuck…?
For real, I can't stand you.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.771
Iyanna wants to wait
until marriage and I respect that.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.816
Still gonna let her know
I'm very affectionate, very intimate,

21:15.899 --> 21:18.402
and there's different ways
to show intimacy without sex.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.486
So soft.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.030
A good magician never tells his tricks.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.329
Where's your most tense spots?

21:29.413 --> 21:30.872
-Tense?
-Yeah.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.833
Mmm, everywhere.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.878
Definitely everywhere.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.886
Okay, thanks.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.473
-Hope yours is as good as this.
-Shut up.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.393
-I got high expectations.
-Oh my God.

21:52.185 --> 21:55.188
He was talking a lot of crap.
He was like, "I have the best hands."

21:55.272 --> 21:58.066
All right, we'll see.
This massage got me a little hot.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.694
I was like, "Okay. I'm a little sweaty."

22:06.658 --> 22:09.536
I enjoy Jarrette to the fullest.
He's hard to resist.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.833
Even more so when he's naked.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.419
He's really hard to resist.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.171
I saw it all.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.088
It was nice.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.215
You know. Yeah, real nice.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.594
-Is that oil?
-I got balm. You can't feel over here?

22:25.677 --> 22:28.138
I got some soft tissue,
some hard tissue.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.056
Yeah.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.851
I bet it didn't help you had keloids.

22:33.352 --> 22:37.105
Yes, I don't know what it'd look like
if I didn't have keloids…

22:41.777 --> 22:44.071
Ooh. I like-a this.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.132
I can't wait for this.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.177
This is our first date.
Couldn't ask for a better place.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.887
I know. This is legit paradise.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.398
-Are you excited to sail?
-I am excited.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.234
-Have you been before? You haven't?
-No, I have not.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.027
Oh my gosh. Then this is gonna be so fun.

23:24.111 --> 23:27.072
I can't wait. It's a nice little
adrenaline rush for me. Have you?

23:27.155 --> 23:28.490
-Yeah, I have.
-Is it fun?

23:28.573 --> 23:31.034
I know you're scared
of it tipping, but we'll be okay.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.203
Yeah, if I'm driving,
it's a problem.

23:33.286 --> 23:34.454
It'll be fun.

23:34.996 --> 23:38.417
I'm gonna suffocate
while I'm out on the water. There we go.

23:39.376 --> 23:42.921
I think it looks good.
Yeah. Okay. Perfect.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.424
This is me
and Natalie's first real date.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.927
I couldn't picture a better way to do it.
Just something fun and goofy and unique.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.763
That's our personalities,
and I feel like that's our relationship.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.475
I knew I'd always have my Leo
and Kate Winslet moment here on the water.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.396
-You talking about the <i>Titanic? </i>Oh my God.
-Yeah.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.273
We'll remember this date
the rest of our lives.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.607
Okay, hold on.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.965
All right, I'm starting to get seasick.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.098
When I got sick out there,
she was very caring and very supportive,

24:35.182 --> 24:37.934
asking me how I was doing
and if I needed anything.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.563
I'm just excited with Natalie,
and I don't know how I got so lucky.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.070
You could tell me
you'll always be there and care for me,

24:49.154 --> 24:51.990
but today was the first example
that she actually will be.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.116
And I love that.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.541
-Are you okay?

25:02.042 --> 25:04.085
-Are you sure?
-I'm good.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.671
-That was really fun though.
-It was fun.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.925
You popped my sailing cherry
and that'll never happen ever again.

25:10.008 --> 25:13.303
-Was that the first and last time?
-The first and that'll be the last.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.848
-To never doing that again.
-Cheers to that. Yes, that as well, yes.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.352
But to hopefully many more
of these fun vacations together.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.812
-I hope so.
Yes. Cheers, darling.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.776
I never thought this would happen.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.570
You have a ring on your finger,
my fiancée…

25:30.654 --> 25:31.905
Yeah, it's crazy.

25:31.988 --> 25:35.784
I haven't said the word "girlfriend"
in four years,

25:35.867 --> 25:38.036
but it's like, I'm so happy.

25:38.119 --> 25:38.954
Me too.

25:39.037 --> 25:42.165
You can love someone without seeing them,
but I think there's…

25:42.916 --> 25:46.878
I just love you so much more
because you're beautiful too.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.715
Ow! You are beautiful though.

25:50.799 --> 25:54.094
Oh my gosh, I think if you didn't look
like you, I'd still feel the same.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.514
-Do you think I'm pretty?
-Do I think you're pretty?

25:57.597 --> 25:59.641
-Think I'm pretty?
-You fishing for compliments?

25:59.724 --> 26:00.559
Mm-hmm.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.604
-Not really. I'm just-- Yes.
-See, honestly, it's so…

26:04.688 --> 26:07.315
Stop doing that to me.
I'm trying to have a conversation.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.442
"Are you fishing for compliments?" Stop.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.111
-Have a normal conversation.
-Okay.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.113
You're making it much harder
than what it is.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.574
You joke a lot.

26:15.657 --> 26:19.786
-I do. You hate it.
-It kinda gets a little old after a while.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.872
-Oh my…
-I know. Sorry, but it's true.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.301
Oh, this is beautiful.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.930
Deepti!

26:39.014 --> 26:40.473
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

26:40.557 --> 26:42.350
What's up? What's up?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.021
-Hey!
-Hi!

26:46.980 --> 26:48.064
What's up?

26:48.148 --> 26:51.359
Shayne's voice
was kind of annoying.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.569
-I'm Shayne.
-Hi, Shayne!

26:52.652 --> 26:54.821
-Oh my God.
-It was really bro-ish.

26:54.904 --> 26:59.284
I was like, "Couldn't live with this for
the rest of my life. That's a no for me."

26:59.367 --> 27:00.535
-Hey!
-How are you?

27:00.619 --> 27:01.703
Good!

27:01.786 --> 27:05.707
Shayne stood out the most to me,
'cause he's such a ball of energy.

27:05.790 --> 27:11.046
I think we would've had a really fun,
cool type of relationship, honestly.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.382


27:16.885 --> 27:20.013
-They're so cute!
-Sallory! Sallory's in the house!

27:20.096 --> 27:21.640
Okay. Do you s--

27:21.723 --> 27:25.226
I don't know if Jarrette
saw Mallory or not. I didn't look.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.688
-They're so cute.
-Mal, your dress!

27:28.772 --> 27:32.108
I have a girl crush on Mallory,
so I don't think I'd be paying attention

27:32.192 --> 27:35.403
if he's looking at her or not,
'cause I'm probably looking at her.

27:35.487 --> 27:39.699
This is weird. It's so crazy
to see all the couples together.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.994
-Damn, everyone's so attractive. This is…
-It's great.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.037
Yeah.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.623
Hello, hello, hello.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.793
Welcome. Everyone looks so good.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.921
-You guys enjoying your romantic getaway?
-Yes.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.214
-To you guys.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.548
To you guys! Wow!

27:56.341 --> 27:57.175
Hey.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.512
-Who we got? Who is this?
-Oh, that's Nick.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.056
-Hi, Nick, how are you?
-You're solo?!

28:03.932 --> 28:05.058
We broke up.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.979
-No, I'm just kidding. She's…
-What?

28:10.480 --> 28:14.067
-Look at Shayne! Oh my God.
-Yo, what?

28:14.150 --> 28:17.320
She's under the weather.
She got some sort of stomach bug.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.364
-So, it's unfortunate.
-Aww.

28:19.447 --> 28:23.326
I hate bread. But I don't know
what to do to make me feel better.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.954
Looks like you love bread
from this standpoint.

28:27.997 --> 28:30.750
No. I'm gonna throw it right back up. So…

28:31.835 --> 28:35.004
-At least you're close to the toilet.
-I can't move.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.965
Welcome
to your romantic getaway.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.175
It'll be romantic
when her tummy feels better.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.260
Totally agree.

28:40.343 --> 28:43.596
Congratulations on all your engagements.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.473
-Cheers!
-Congrats, guys.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.891
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.686
You guys fell in love,
and found someone to marry

28:49.769 --> 28:51.730
without ever seeing them.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.357
This is a chance
to turn that emotional connection

28:54.441 --> 28:55.942
into a physical one.

28:58.153 --> 29:02.323
Ladies, I would like you to meet
the gentlemen, and gentlemen,

29:02.407 --> 29:05.160
I'd like you to meet the ladies
who you dated,

29:05.243 --> 29:07.662
but did not propose to in the pods.

29:11.624 --> 29:15.837
Soon we'll see how the realities
of the material world, your looks,

29:15.920 --> 29:20.008
your age, your background,
maybe even seeing someone here

29:20.091 --> 29:21.676
who you didn't choose…

29:22.552 --> 29:25.013
You guys are four weeks away
from your wedding.

29:28.183 --> 29:31.853
Will you say, "I do" to the person
you chose to marry sight unseen,

29:31.936 --> 29:35.940
or will you walk away
from that person forever?

29:36.649 --> 29:38.860
Is love truly blind?

29:40.278 --> 29:42.155
We certainly hope you prove it is.

29:42.655 --> 29:46.159
Cheers to love,
and happiness, and to all of you.

29:46.659 --> 29:48.703
-Cheers. Congrats.
-Thanks, guys.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.414
All right. Have fun.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.626
-See y'all later.
-Enjoy!

29:57.420 --> 29:59.464
-But when you--
-On my God!

30:00.381 --> 30:04.219
-We really were excited to see Kyle.
-He's not even here!

30:04.302 --> 30:06.596
-Where the fuck are they?
-What, who? Kyle and…

30:06.679 --> 30:09.432
-It was a crash course with them.
-I'm like, "Hold out."

30:09.516 --> 30:12.977
-I'm upset. I wanna see 'em.
-I'm upset. I'm really upset.

30:14.437 --> 30:17.357
I wanted his celebrity-couple name,
Shayne, to be Shaina.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.776
I wanted him to be
with Shaina just 'cause of that.

30:19.859 --> 30:22.362
-Just 'cause of that.
-I don't know what happened.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.531
-What do you mean? Yeah.
-Kyle and Shaina.

30:24.614 --> 30:25.824
What could've happened

30:25.907 --> 30:29.911
that was that bad enough
for them to leave? Crazy.

30:29.994 --> 30:33.540
-Shots! Shot! Shots! Shots!
-Shots! Shot! Shots! Shots!

30:33.623 --> 30:35.708
It's so awesome seeing,

30:35.792 --> 30:39.462
honestly, what I feel
like are my best friends right now.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.006
-Ladies, want a shot?
-Honorary shot for Danielle.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.218
I'm just gonna say the elephant
in the room. Cheers to Shaina.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.845
-I mean…

30:46.928 --> 30:48.763
-God!

30:50.306 --> 30:52.600
This… This is done!

30:52.684 --> 30:54.352
My God, dude!

30:54.435 --> 30:56.771
-Okay, cheers, guys.
-Shanalie!

30:57.856 --> 31:00.692
We came up with the name
for you guys. Sallory.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.694
-That's so funny.
-I was saying 'Malvador'…

31:02.777 --> 31:04.529
Or it's gonna be-- Malvador?

31:04.612 --> 31:08.700
Seeing Sal was so amazing.
I'm so happy for him and Mal.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.494
He's exactly what I expected. Honestly.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.788
He's such a calming soul to me.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.416
Sal, did I tell you?
If Shake and I don't work out,

31:16.499 --> 31:17.834
he wants to marry you.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.587
-Just grab a cup. Grab--
-To all the exes!

31:24.549 --> 31:27.093
Mallory. We didn't talk very much.
I just--

31:27.176 --> 31:30.013
-I know! So nice to meet you! Yeah.
-Happy to be here with you.

31:30.096 --> 31:33.516
Cheers! How are you?
I love your pug shirt.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.685
Would you look at my lipstick?
Is it still red?

31:35.768 --> 31:38.104
Yeah. Yes!
You want me to take care of that?

31:38.187 --> 31:39.147
They're so cute.

31:39.230 --> 31:42.859
Oh my God. I'm so happy to see
Natalie and Shayne together.

31:42.942 --> 31:47.447
The way that Shayne was described
in the pods, Natalie is our Shayne.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.407
Stop.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.868
You always fuck up my lipstick.

31:53.161 --> 31:56.164
Shayne and Natalie.
Probably gonna get married.

31:56.247 --> 31:59.626
How is it gonna go?
Long term? It's gonna be wild.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.544
-You look beautiful.
-Really?

32:01.628 --> 32:05.006
-You're the hottest one here. By far.
-Shut up. Whatever.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.927
-We all dated each other, so it's like…
-I know. It's crazy.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.346
At the end of the day,
we're trying to find somebody

32:11.429 --> 32:12.472
we really connect with.

32:12.555 --> 32:14.265
-Connect with. Absolutely.
-Yeah.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.894
I love that. So, cheers to that.
We're here for a reason.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.146
Love that. I love that.

32:20.229 --> 32:23.024
You have great teeth. Did you have braces?

32:23.107 --> 32:25.318
-I've had braces, yeah.
-Okay. Sorry. Keep going.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.236
-What were you saying?

32:29.822 --> 32:31.783
-Shake, what the fuck?
-What?

32:31.866 --> 32:33.868
My first impression of Natalie is

32:33.952 --> 32:36.621
I thought this was a girl
I kicked out of a club once.

32:36.704 --> 32:40.124
I was DJing, and it was a girl
that looked just like her

32:40.208 --> 32:45.004
and she was being super annoying,
and I thought that could've been Natalie,

32:45.088 --> 32:47.090
but I'm thankful to find
that it wasn't her.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.092
I wanna have
a great relationship with her.

32:49.175 --> 32:52.804
-No, I'm self-conscious about my teeth.
-You should be thrilled by your teeth.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.723
-Just let those babies shine and you do.
-Thanks.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.309
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.019
How did yesterday go?

33:00.103 --> 33:01.646
-This is my home.
-Amazing.

33:01.729 --> 33:02.855
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.649
Were y'all nervous day one?

33:04.732 --> 33:07.443
For Danielle and I, it was super anxious.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.989
And in about five minutes, it was like,
"Yeah, this is totally normal."

33:11.072 --> 33:13.992
-Bro, what is that? You know what that is.
-Camera, look at that.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.120
-I was just scratching.
-That's not a scratch mark.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.997
-That's not a scratch mark.
-What is it?

33:19.080 --> 33:22.291
-Looks like some lips to me.
-No. But she did bite my lip.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.711
-So bad that it bled.
-Oh shit.

33:24.794 --> 33:28.006
Yesterday she did it and I'm like,
"You gotta stop. It was bleedin'."

33:28.089 --> 33:29.632
"You bit it so hard."

33:29.716 --> 33:32.802
-Okay, did anyone get intimate--
-There's a lot going on.

33:32.885 --> 33:36.514
Between both of us, I don't kiss and tell.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.016
Don't be so coy, guys.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.768
-I'm glad you're fucking happy.
-Yeah, dude, I am.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.980
I wish I was that coy. Maybe I'll say,
"It's none of your business."

33:45.356 --> 33:48.067
But knowing Shayne,
he's probably gonna be like, "You know…"

33:48.151 --> 33:51.279
Trust me.
I tried getting back on the sailboat.

33:51.362 --> 33:54.949
Butt cheeks, hey now.
She wasn't very graceful either.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.994
She got on the sailboat
and she was rolling like a potato on it--

33:58.077 --> 34:00.830
-Excuse me?! Did you tell them--

34:00.913 --> 34:02.123
Fucking little--

34:02.206 --> 34:07.211
If I was to say somebody would make it,
probably say Shayne and Natalie.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.173
I heard the potato thing.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.509
They have really good chemistry,

34:13.593 --> 34:16.846
so I feel like if anybody
outside of me and Iyanna, they'll make it.

34:17.346 --> 34:21.017
You seem like the kind of guy
that like, flexes in the mirror.

34:21.100 --> 34:25.229
Get the fuck… No, mirror on the top of…
On the ceiling kinda guy. Yeah.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.773
-Like old times.
-To old times.

34:26.856 --> 34:30.109
-Honestly… And then there were five.
-How are you and Jarrette?

34:30.193 --> 34:33.404
-Really good.
-Good! You look really happy together.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.989
-Yeah, so cute.
-Thanks.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.951
We're so fuckin' similar. That shit
just translated over from the pods.

34:39.035 --> 34:41.204
-100%.
-That's amazing. Dude, happy for ya.

34:41.287 --> 34:45.333
We were emotionally intimate.
Lots of heavy cuddling.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.250
-Good.
-Yeah.

34:46.334 --> 34:50.046
We decided we wanna wait
and see shit out. We have lots of time.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.297
-Cool.
-That's good.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.215
Yeah.

34:52.298 --> 34:56.636
She's like the number one hype girl
I could ever, ever, ever hope for.

34:56.719 --> 34:57.762
Her?!

34:59.013 --> 35:01.849
-No! Don't do that again.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.684
All right? I won't tell you now.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.188
So, she's like the number one hype girl.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.815
-So fucking fun…
-Yeah.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.943
I do not…
I'm not physically attracted to her, man.

35:12.026 --> 35:14.570
It feels like I'm with
my aunt or something.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.656
-Don't laugh at that.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.367
-You know? I didn't mean it as a joke.
-That's funny.

35:19.450 --> 35:23.454
She's fucking super fun. Super easy going
and easy to get along with.

35:23.538 --> 35:27.125
-Everybody fucking loves her.
-I don't know. We'll see.

35:28.501 --> 35:31.337
-Is anyone else getting bit?
-How was the actual intimacy?

35:31.420 --> 35:33.881
-It's good.
-It was fire? Was it fire?

35:33.965 --> 35:36.425
No. No, no, no, no.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.469
-We get along great.
-So what's the problem?

35:38.553 --> 35:39.637
Physical attraction.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.099
How is there not any intimacy
with you and Deeps? I don't get it.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.519
I thought that'd be
fucking rock-solid easy.

35:48.271 --> 35:51.440
You gotta try to keep an open mind
with situations, I think.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.193
-I want to see.
-God, it makes me sad.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.528
Yeah.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.322
-Ours was lights out.
-Yeah?

35:58.406 --> 36:01.200
-It was lights out. It was…
-I knew it. Nice.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.494
It was fucking just, like…

36:03.578 --> 36:06.622
If there was a video in that
fucking place, we'd sell millions.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.624
-Whoa. Maybe there is.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.587
Awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.590
You seem nervous.

36:15.673 --> 36:19.302
-Do you think I'm nervous?
-Yeah. I can tell.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.308
If I do ask for another one,
pour me water. I'll thank you later.

36:25.391 --> 36:26.517
-Fuck no!
-I'm good.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.854
-Pour him a shot of tequila.
-Mallory's pretty beautiful.

36:29.937 --> 36:31.397
-She is.
-I'm not gonna lie.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.815
She is, but, you know--

36:32.899 --> 36:35.193
I'm gonna tell Danielle
as soon as I get back.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.777
-Really?
-Don't want her to get mad.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.072
She's not gonna get mad. I'm kidding.
Shock? Surprise? What did you think?

36:40.156 --> 36:43.326
Just off her voice,
I was like, "I know she's fine."

36:43.409 --> 36:45.536
I just knew it from her voice. I know it.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.788
Everyone here's beautiful,

36:47.872 --> 36:50.666
but even sweaty, I think you're beautiful.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.294
Thank you, my good man.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.338
-You're not too shabby yourself.
-I know.

36:56.088 --> 36:59.175
-Is it weird that Mallory's here with Sal?
-No, it's not.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.345
The weirdest part is
I haven't gone up and said hi to her.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.180
-Have you said anything to her?
-No.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.766
She hasn't done the same thing either, so…

37:07.266 --> 37:10.228
Try standing between you two.
It's fucking weird.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.520
-Just be like…
-I'm fine.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.815
Just wish her well.
That's all. Her and Sal.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.317
Trust me.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.946
Iyanna and Jarrette.

37:22.031 --> 37:25.993
I want the best for them.
He's a little standoffish against Mallory.

37:26.077 --> 37:30.456
It's a little weird.
Like, "I asked a girl to marry me."

37:30.539 --> 37:33.709
"She said no, so I went
to the second one." I…

37:35.378 --> 37:37.421
Make it comfortable.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.007
-It's okay.
-Yeah, okay.

37:40.091 --> 37:44.595
-I'll get in when I get in. It's okay.
-I'm not gonna-- There it is.

37:45.471 --> 37:48.266
What if she said she'd say yes?
Would you have done it?

37:48.849 --> 37:50.810
Man! Leave me alone.

37:52.561 --> 37:55.231
Hey, Shake,
can I talk to her for two seconds?

37:55.731 --> 37:56.649
Yeah.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.150
-You know?
-Just two seconds.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.986
-So sorry. Sorry.
-No…

38:06.367 --> 38:09.078
-How are you?
-I mean…

38:10.204 --> 38:13.207
Did I look like what you expected
me to look like? I really--

38:13.291 --> 38:17.378
Jarrette, I could see your fucking voice
behind the goddamn wall.

38:17.920 --> 38:22.800
Okay, JerBear.
Was this what you expected? Probably not.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.846
Yes. The dream that I had,
I said, "dark, curly hair."

38:29.849 --> 38:32.727
I've never cried… I cried so much.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.771
That was the hardest thing I've ever done.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.066
I had never been
so caught off guard in my life.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.361
I never thought
that I was your number one.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.197
-How? How did you <i>not</i> get that?
-Never.

38:45.281 --> 38:49.201
Every time we talked,
I was just, like, "Mal Mal. Mal Mal."

38:49.285 --> 38:51.746
-I was--
-Because that was the thing?

38:51.829 --> 38:54.999
Who else called you a nickname?
Who else gave you a nickname?

38:56.125 --> 38:59.837
-I heard everything in the morning.
-Y'all were shifting every day.

39:00.463 --> 39:03.007
I connected with both of y'all
for different reasons.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.634
You're cool as fuck, man. I…

39:06.719 --> 39:11.766
The connection we had
was, like… so fucking genuine.

39:11.849 --> 39:15.436
It was literally,
from day one, I was just like…

39:16.312 --> 39:18.147
-But that's my thing.
-Bruh…

39:18.230 --> 39:22.109
I was mad I never got to talk to you,
like, really talk to you,

39:22.693 --> 39:24.195
'cause you wouldn't.

39:24.278 --> 39:28.783
-What do I say at that point? I'm just--
-You were like, "It's over!"

39:28.866 --> 39:29.992
I was hurt as hell.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.162
-No, you have your pride, like--
-I was hurt as hell.

39:35.289 --> 39:40.002
I have a really hard thing with trust,
so for me to only rely on someone's words…

39:40.586 --> 39:44.340
-Words are so easy. You can lie. Actions…
-Words just… Exactly. Exactly.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.928
-I feel awkward as fuck.
-Why?

39:49.011 --> 39:51.430
'Cause I do. But that's just who I am.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.183
I've never got that from you.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.145
This is crazy.

39:58.854 --> 40:00.481
Sal is a good one.

40:00.564 --> 40:04.819
Sure. You guys are both amazing people.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.406
You ready to get married?

40:13.327 --> 40:15.663
-Wait a minute. Wait. Time out.
-But it's--

40:15.746 --> 40:17.790
-No. No, no, no, no, no.
-But it's--

40:17.873 --> 40:21.335
You've always been honest.
Wait, what? Are you ready to get married?

40:23.379 --> 40:27.049
Sal's a good guy. Is Sal somebody
you'd go for outside of here?

40:27.633 --> 40:29.427
Um, no.

40:30.886 --> 40:33.055
-He's so, like…
-I love Sal.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.724
The thoughtfulness and, like, that.

40:35.808 --> 40:36.934
I felt like…

40:38.644 --> 40:40.396
I'm such a guy's girl.

40:40.479 --> 40:42.940
-Hence why the fuck we connected.
-Dude.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.526
How did I not fucking see that shit?

40:45.609 --> 40:48.904
Like, these are--
Like, I-- That's so import…

40:48.988 --> 40:53.617
It is important to me. I fucking--
I wanna go catch a game. I wanna go…

40:53.701 --> 40:56.328
But that's who I am. That's what I want.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.997
-That's what I love.
-It's easy.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.290
-It's so easy.
-Yeah.

40:59.373 --> 41:04.128
But most men that are into sports
and things like that,

41:04.211 --> 41:09.592
or that connect me in that aspect,
they don't put me in priority.

41:10.176 --> 41:15.097
They don't know how to fucking be like,
"Hey. You're a bad bitch."

41:15.181 --> 41:18.851
"Let me just… You're beautiful.
Let me do things for you."

41:18.934 --> 41:21.103
"Let me… You're gorgeous."

41:21.187 --> 41:22.646
-I knew that!
-I need that.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.316
But what's so fucking wild…

41:25.399 --> 41:27.485
-I woulda did that.
-I'm tired of, like…

41:27.568 --> 41:28.736
I woulda did that.

41:30.112 --> 41:31.113
You're amazing.

41:34.992 --> 41:39.246
You guys were both fucking the shit.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.956
Did you guys talk about this?

41:41.040 --> 41:44.293
Sal talked to me,
on my anniversary of my fucking…

41:44.376 --> 41:46.212
He never mentioned your name.

41:46.295 --> 41:50.382
I can't be mad that you had
a strong connection with Sal. I…

41:50.466 --> 41:53.260
-It's so hard.
-I put my best foot forward.

41:53.344 --> 41:58.224
I had made two strong-ass connections.
Y'all were both right here.

41:58.307 --> 42:01.435
-From day one.
-Yeah. Listen, JerBear…

42:02.311 --> 42:03.187
Mal Mal.

42:07.399 --> 42:12.112
I feel like Sal and Mallory
were not as close as they seem to be.

42:12.613 --> 42:16.408
Honestly, I'm not completely convinced
that it's all kosher.

42:18.702 --> 42:23.499
-I had two connections. I told you.
-Well, so did I. Well, so did I.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.216
And how do you really feel?

42:32.967 --> 42:36.762
-So, I was… I had these…
-How the fuck do you really feel?

42:37.721 --> 42:41.100
How are you feeling?
You look a little, kinda bummed right now.

42:42.309 --> 42:45.729
I felt some kind of way
about Mallory when I first saw her.

42:54.905 --> 42:58.993
I don't know what was said,
but I know she's not interested in me.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.831
And I want to go home.

43:06.458 --> 43:07.334
That's all.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.505
That's a nice ring.
That's not the ring you wanted.

43:12.506 --> 43:15.009
-Yeah.
-You wanted gold.

43:15.509 --> 43:18.637
-You wanted gold, yeah.
-You're so funny.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.932
You don't like that ring.
I know you don't.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.684
You like gold rings, don't you?

43:24.518 --> 43:25.811
I do.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.649
-You know how I know? Because I asked.
-Yeah.
