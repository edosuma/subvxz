You're my best friend

Oh, my God. Babe, stop it.
You're gonna make me--

01:41.435 --> 01:43.278
If you get emotional,
you're gonna kill me.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.447
I'm trying to
get through this, babe.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.651
I love you,
more than anything.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.870
Will you marry me?

Yes, Mitch Rapp.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.749
I'll marry you.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.881
Sorry, it's hard one-handed.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.011
You like it?
It was my mom's ring.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.764

two drinks, please?

03:22.119 --> 03:24.167
Dos bebidas,

03:24.246 --> 03:25.793
Um, I just got engaged,
so something special.

Dr. Frain: You wanted to kill them all,
and then go on killing.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.352
Pretty extreme,
don't you think?

16:17.435 --> 16:19.938
No, I don't think
that's extreme at all.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.614
I think people like that
deserve to die

16:21.689 --> 16:23.612

you can imagine.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.910
What do you remember
about your parents' death?

16:26.736 --> 16:27.988
Car crash.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.287
I was in Massachusetts.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.956
They were in Tunisia
at the time.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.375
I was 14.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.748
That's what I remember.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.171
You started having
discipline problems.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.294
Got yourself kicked out of
three boarding schools.

16:39.373 --> 16:44.220
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I wonder what that was about.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.549

<i>Your grad studies

17:36.514 --> 17:39.017
I know who you are.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.773
Any idea how long
you been here?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.193
30 days.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.867
Enough time for you to figure out
a couple things.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.321
Yeah, yeah. I've figured out
a lot about myself.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.406
It's been a very reflective time.
Thank you.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.459
You wouldn't have made it through
the next 20 seconds there alive.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.583
I guess we'll never
know now, will we?

17:59.662 --> 18:02.791
You told Dr. Frain you thought
you were gonna kill Mansur

18:02.873 --> 18:04.716
and wipe out his whole cell.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.009
For starters.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.758
Mmm-hmm.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.589
You had an even bigger agenda,
didn't you, Mitch?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.346
What did you think,

18:12.425 --> 18:14.974
you were gonna jump from cell to cell
taking out terrorists?

18:15.052 --> 18:16.304
<i>Righting the world's wrongs?</i>

18:16.387 --> 18:18.139
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

18:18.222 --> 18:20.441
I mean, it's more
than you accomplished.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.610
<i>I'm gonna let you in
on something.</i>

18:22.685 --> 18:25.438
Our people here, they don't know
what to do with you.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.024
A lot of them think we should
just throw you in a supermax.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.818
<i>Me?</i>

18:30.901 --> 18:32.869
<i>I</i> like your agenda, Mitch.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.368
I can help you with it,
if you throw in with us.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.618
<i>We can teach you how to play
with the big boys.</i>

18:38.701 --> 18:40.453
Yeah, let me
stop you right there.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.255
You don't think I considered
that 18 months ago?

18:43.331 --> 18:45.834
Joining the CIA?

18:45.916 --> 18:48.590
I made the decision to
pursue Mansur on my own

18:48.669 --> 18:50.717
'cause I knew
I could get it clone.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.926
What you need to understand
is that I'm the only way.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.428
To get what you want.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.388
Why the hell
would I trust you?

19:00.097 --> 19:01.815
Because I believe in you.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.524
And I'm all you've got.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.652
<i>CIA Officer:

<i>from a decommissioned

<i>If they get their hands
on a nuclear trigger</i>

19:16.405 --> 19:17.827
<i>and a physicist to build it,</i>

19:17.907 --> 19:20.535
<i>they'd be able to arm it

Irene: Tom?

19:32.797 --> 19:34.219
He's testing
through the roof.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.346
Might be the best
I've ever seen.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.519
We've had him under surveillance
for six months.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.891
Martial arts,
gun skills.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.189
<i>I've surveilled dozens
of these vigilantes.</i>

19:42.264 --> 19:44.437
<i>This one is different.</i>

19:44.517 --> 19:46.360
Yeah, well, I've gone
over these, Irene.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.529
He's non-compliant,
he's oppositional.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.527
He got us
into Mansur‘s cell.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.529
That's a hell of a lot more
than we ever managed.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.860
All right,
Orion is an elite unit, Irene.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.320
A secret unit.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.872
Reports to you, me,
and no one else.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.073
I don't want
to be responsible

19:59.156 --> 20:00.248
for that kind of mistake.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.076
Now, that's Hurley talking.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.877
Yeah, well, he's called me
twice about this.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.923
<i>This kind of psych profile
scares the hell out of him.</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:08.715
As far as he's concerned,

20:08.791 --> 20:10.714
<i>you're sending him a Section 8
with an ax to grind.</i>

20:10.793 --> 20:12.545
What happened to that kid
on the beach,

20:12.628 --> 20:14.005
it changed him.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.590
You can't train that
into someone.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.552
<i>His psych profile is exactly
what I've been looking for.</i>

20:18.634 --> 20:19.760
(Stansfield sighs)

20:20.928 --> 20:22.396
Polygraph?

20:22.471 --> 20:23.563
Flying colors.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.899
All right.
Good luck with Hurley.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.856
Oh, Irene.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.691
We'll have fresh intel
on the Russian

20:33.774 --> 20:35.492
plutonium situation
in two hours.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.070
Stay by your phone.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.154
Yeah.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.466
You can take
the blindfold off.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.928
So, what do I need to know
about this guy?

21:02.011 --> 21:03.103
<i>Irene:
Stan Hurley.</i>

21:03.179 --> 21:05.273
He's a warrior.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.769
<i>Ex-Navy SEAL.</i>

21:06.849 --> 21:08.943
<i>My daddy served with him
in the Persian Gulf.</i>

21:28.746 --> 21:30.214
Did you go through
this program?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.212
<i>Irene: I went through a program.
Not this one.</i>

21:32.291 --> 21:34.259
It's not like becoming
a spy or Special Ops,

21:34.335 --> 21:35.461
none of those things.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.255
Good.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.951
<i>Dr. Frain‘.
So, what are your goals, Mitch?</i>

22:00.152 --> 22:02.621
Mitch:
<i>My</i> goals?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.448
<i>My goal is to have them
lie awake at night,</i>

22:04.532 --> 22:05.909
<i>knowing I'm coming for them.</i>

22:23.759 --> 22:25.227
(@109 barking)

22:36.188 --> 22:38.407
I thought you were supposed
to be on the patch.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.537
You saw those tests.
Yeah, I saw them.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.909
He's off the charts.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.034
I've seen
off the charts before.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.619
And he's got
none of the bad habits

22:49.702 --> 22:51.670
he'd have to unlearn
if he had military training.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.006
Unlearn?

22:54.081 --> 22:55.879
Come on, Stan.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.676
You drop one of your Navy SEALs
in an urban setting,

22:57.751 --> 23:00.004
you can spot the boot camp
on them a mile away.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.088
<i>We're not fighting the--</i>

23:01.171 --> 23:02.639
Cold War? Yeah, I know.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.262
You keep telling me that,
Miss Deputy Director.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.929
Oh, wow.
"Miss Deputy Director."

23:08.012 --> 23:10.014
Your daddy
would agree with me.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.400
I'll be checking in with you
every 48 hours.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.488
I'm on a plane to London
in the morning.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.946
And go back on the patch,
for God's sake.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.829
Don't prove me wrong.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.953
(engine starting)

23:34.246 --> 23:35.463
She ain't coming back.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.632
<i>Hey -</i>

23:41.670 --> 23:43.013
Eyes front and center.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.258
Sorry.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.389
"Sorry"? Do I look like one of
your college professors?

23:47.468 --> 23:49.345
You talk to me,
you call me "sir," son.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.263
Yes, sir.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.235
What the fuck
you doing here?

24:00.314 --> 24:02.112
Did you have some bad things
happen to you,

24:02.191 --> 24:04.114
some shitty things
happen to you?

24:04.193 --> 24:07.072
Now you wanna kill
those mean old terrorists.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.280
Go get some bad guys.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.082
What makes you think
you can make it

24:11.158 --> 24:12.330
through my selection process?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.002
Permission to speak, sir?

24:14.078 --> 24:15.580
Sure, go ahead
if you got something to say.

24:15.663 --> 24:16.710
Like this is all a big mistake
and you wanna go home.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.336
You wanna go home? Good.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.416
Get the fuck out of here.
I'll drive you myself.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.252
Not at all, sir.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.382
I was gonna suggest we maybe
speed this whole thing up?

24:23.837 --> 24:25.384
My guess is,
if you and I go hand-to-hand,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.137
you could probably figure out
inside of 20 seconds

24:27.216 --> 24:28.559
whether or not I have
what it takes to make it

24:28.634 --> 24:29.977
through your
selection process.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.313
So, what do you think?

24:40.562 --> 24:42.610
We got an empty cot,
empty footlocker.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.408
They're both yours
as long as you can last.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.279
Sounds good.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.989
Follow me.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.325
See you out there.

24:52.408 --> 24:53.660
Heard a lot about you,
by the way.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.244
Excited to see
what you got.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.342
Kill me.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.138
(both grunting)

25:16.932 --> 25:19.526
People think you can slice
a man's throat like this.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.774
That's only in the movies.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.356
<i>Right there.</i>

25:24.273 --> 25:25.274
Do it.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.359
<i>No noise. No mess.</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:34.415
(Mitch panting)

25:35.242 --> 25:36.789
<i>Victor, you're up.</i>

25:44.585 --> 25:45.882
(both grunting)

25:48.255 --> 25:50.223
(groans)

25:50.299 --> 25:51.801
What the fuck, man?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.761
Who grabs a fucking blade?

26:12.321 --> 26:13.914
Come on, you fuckin‘ pussy.
Let's go!

26:22.331 --> 26:23.753
You gotta have eyes
in the back of your head.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.719
You flinch, you die.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.435
Orion is about the mission.

26:35.511 --> 26:36.683
It ain't about you.

26:41.183 --> 26:44.232
You go down out there, you're a ghost,
you don't exist.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.656
There's nobody,
nobody coming back for you.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.743
You're about to be captured.

26:57.366 --> 26:58.367
(gun clicks)

26:59.493 --> 27:00.745
Bye-bye.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.713
(Spits)

27:07.376 --> 27:11.552
<i>Stansﬁeki:
We now know 15 kilos of plutonium-239</i>

27:11.630 --> 27:13.257
went missing
during the Russian breach.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.469
Irene: It's enough to build
a full-scale nuclear weapon.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.522
But that would likely require
the resources of a nation-state.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.473
As Iranian Chief
of General Staff,

27:21.557 --> 27:23.434
I share your concern.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.396
We have been monitoring
the situation as you have.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.321
I'm afraid
we too are in the dark.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.491
Ashani:
For Iran, of course,

27:30.566 --> 27:33.570
a <i>nuclear weapon
is off the table.</i>

27:34.403 --> 27:36.030
We have a treaty.

27:36.113 --> 27:39.583
You have countrymen who are
not too happy about that.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.037
We monitor your nuclear enrichment
program pretty closely,

27:43.120 --> 27:45.873
<i>but black market
plutonium-239 from Russia--</i>

27:45.956 --> 27:48.800
Would be difficult
for inspectors to detect.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.337
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

27:51.420 --> 27:53.172
- (Behruz chuckles)
- Mmm-hmm.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.888
I assure you
as Minister of Defense

27:56.967 --> 28:02.269
that we in Iran recognize
how much the spirit of comity

28:02.347 --> 28:05.772
between our nations
would be compromised

28:05.851 --> 28:07.649
if we were to acquire

28:07.728 --> 28:09.776
weapons-grade plutonium
from any source.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.153
Stansfield:
Yes, <i>it</i> would.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.951
Same goes for
your clients outside Iran,

28:15.027 --> 28:16.654
<i>Hezbollah. Hamas.</i>

28:17.821 --> 28:19.414
<i>The Houthis.</i>

28:19.489 --> 28:23.210
Nuclear weapons are a danger
in any hands, Director.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.162
Wasn't that your pretext
for your invasion

28:25.245 --> 28:26.872
of our neighbor to the west?

28:26.955 --> 28:29.299
One that cost
500,000 Iraqi lives

28:29.374 --> 28:30.751
and left
a wake of destruction

28:30.834 --> 28:32.677
from which our region
has never recovered.

28:32.753 --> 28:36.053
General Rostami, we came only
to tell you what we know.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.974
(Behruz chuckles dryly)

28:38.050 --> 28:39.597
ls that a threat?

28:41.136 --> 28:44.481
Of course not,
Minister Behruz.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.150
Gentlemen, I very much
appreciate you meeting with us.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.728
<i>Rostami".
Not at all.</i>

28:48.810 --> 28:51.063
I only wish we could
offer more insight.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.147
Thank you.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.711
<i>Stansﬁekl:

29:07.788 --> 29:09.415
<i>We need to keep this quiet.</i>

29:10.249 --> 29:11.546
How ready is Orion?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.423
I'll check in with Hurley.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.257

Why is there no one on watch?

29:20.008 --> 29:21.100

29:21.176 --> 29:23.599
You're all dead.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.896
You're dead.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.104
What?

29:32.187 --> 29:35.066
You wanna say something to me?
Say it. Go on, say it.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.491
You got 30 seconds!

29:45.659 --> 29:47.161

30:04.094 --> 30:05.687
<i>Let's just say
you're gonna feel it.</i>

30:06.680 --> 30:07.681

Okay.

That's clever.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.897
at a decommissioned
Russian plutonium facility.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.392
I'm aware.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.398
What you don't know is 15 kilos
of plutonium went missing.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.150
<i>Weapons-grade.</i>

37:11.229 --> 37:13.027
That's a shit-ton
of plutonium.

37:13.106 --> 37:14.449
And it just changed hands.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.363
I wanna show you something.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.450
Take a look at this.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.995
Does that face
bong a gong for you?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.455
<i>Or is it just me?</i>

37:34.002 --> 37:36.425
It can't be him.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.848
Our drones took him out after
the embassy bombing at Bamako.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.550
We never got
a positive ID.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.761
<i>That's our mad dog
out there.</i>

37:46.598 --> 37:48.942
All right.
Let's say it's him.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.189
It's him, Irene.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.317
This gives us a chance to kill
two birds with one stone.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.617
Hamdi Sharif.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.286
He's an arms dealer
working out of Turkey.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.114
Four days ago, he purchased
a Russian-designed nuclear trigger.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.075
And he's gonna be selling it.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.626
<i>Irene:
Sharif's; got the honey.</i>

38:06.701 --> 38:08.920
<i>Now we just wait
for the bee.</i>

38:08.995 --> 38:11.168
<i>We go in,
we fuck up their deal.</i>

38:14.292 --> 38:15.418
And we take 'em both out.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.557
You're going to Istanbul.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.805
<i>We have an agent in place.</i>

38:22.884 --> 38:24.010
<i>She'll meet you
at the airport.</i>

38:24.093 --> 38:25.140
All right.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.102
<i>Annika Ogden. We've had her
on the ground over there</i>

38:28.181 --> 38:29.933
for ﬁve years.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.689
I want Rapp on the team.

38:32.894 --> 38:33.895
Really?

38:33.978 --> 38:35.230
He's ready, Stan.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.532
Actually, Irene,
he's not ready.

38:39.692 --> 38:40.944
But he will be.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.156
(door closes)

38:46.574 --> 38:47.951
You wanted to see me, sir?

38:48.034 --> 38:50.002
Yeah. Shut the door.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.666
<i>We're shipping out.</i>

38:54.749 --> 38:55.841
Set those down there.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.379
You like movies?

39:00.213 --> 39:01.214
Sure.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.968
<i>Mitch:
I got something for you.</i>

39:05.051 --> 39:06.177
What the fuck is this?

39:06.261 --> 39:07.854
Yeah, I thought so.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.182
- You thought so?
- Yeah.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.359
Why are you
even alive, Rapp?

39:14.185 --> 39:15.983
You ever
asked yourself that?

39:17.564 --> 39:20.818
<i>Why you? You know,
of all those people?</i>

39:20.900 --> 39:22.823
You're special, I guess.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.074
Katrina:
Oh, my God!

39:25.113 --> 39:26.365
You want me to turn it up?

39:26.447 --> 39:28.745
- Katrina: I'll marry you!
- Mitch: Take it!

39:28.825 --> 39:31.544
You're a fucking coward, you know that?
Turn that shit off.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.462
<i>Mitch: What do you think?
It's my mom's ring.</i>

39:33.538 --> 39:35.085
You gonna turn it off?

39:35.164 --> 39:37.508
- Mitch on <i>video: Katrina!
- (people screaming)</i>

39:37.584 --> 39:38.756
(gunshot)
(Mitch groans)

39:40.962 --> 39:43.090
<i>Hurley:
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?</i>

39:44.048 --> 39:45.049
I don't.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.310
(groans)

39:55.393 --> 39:56.440
(choking)

39:58.313 --> 39:59.906
You made a big mistake.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.075
You let emotion
cloud your judgment.

40:03.735 --> 40:07.535
Never, ever
let it get personal.

40:07.614 --> 40:08.866
You understand?

40:11.492 --> 40:13.039
(panting)

40:13.995 --> 40:15.417
(coughing)

40:18.166 --> 40:19.964
(continues panting)

40:23.338 --> 40:24.635
Yeah, I got it.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.217
Be ready to go by 5:00.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.553
See you at 4:30.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.654
You know what
you're gonna do here?

40:39.729 --> 40:41.731
- No, sir.
- Correct. You don't.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.361
So keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.442
And wait for my orders.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.653
(all conversing in Turkish)

40:51.532 --> 40:52.875
(all greet in Turkish)

41:15.181 --> 41:19.482
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate
mogul/arms dealer.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.654
<i>He's like Santa Claus
for terrorists.</i>

41:22.689 --> 41:24.111
Scumbag.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.988
Spare me
your junior-year-abroad

41:26.067 --> 41:27.319
moral opinion,
would you, Rapp?

41:27.402 --> 41:30.030
Not really an opinion, sir.
Sharif's a piece of shit.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.410
It's not a crusade.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.617
This mission is practical.
Don't make it--

41:33.700 --> 41:34.826
Personal?

41:34.909 --> 41:37.537
- Exactly.
- Yes, sir.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.837
Victor, you're with me.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.132
<i>Rapp, you and Annika
are eyes on.</i>

41:43.084 --> 41:44.461
<i>Annika:
Sharif has a routine.</i>

41:44.544 --> 41:45.796
<i>Let's see if anything
breaks his pattern.</i>

41:45.878 --> 41:47.880
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.012
All right, we got 48 hours.

41:50.091 --> 41:52.469
Quick, clean.
No footprint.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.395
This town's ready
to blow as it is.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.083
(inaudible)

42:38.514 --> 42:40.141
Annika:
Where the hell are you going?

42:51.069 --> 42:52.070
(speaks Turkish)

43:03.664 --> 43:05.257
That was
fucking reckless, Rapp.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.380
I took
the initiative, sir.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.052
- Victor: He could've been made.
- Well, I wasn't.

43:09.796 --> 43:11.514
Here we go.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.011
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.219
A meeting at a restaurant
on Akbiyik Street.

43:15.301 --> 43:18.305
That's right before Sharif
goes to see his mistress.

43:18.387 --> 43:19.684
That breaks his pattern.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.141
<i>Victor:
I'll tell you what'II break his pattern.</i>

43:21.224 --> 43:22.726
<i>When that fucking assistant
tells his boss</i>

43:22.809 --> 43:24.026
he lost his goddamn phone.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.355
Mitch: He won't.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.111
He's too afraid of Sharif to let him know
he screwed up.

43:29.190 --> 43:31.113
<i>All right. We go tomorrow.</i>

43:31.192 --> 43:32.193
What's the mission, sir?

43:32.276 --> 43:34.244
Eliminate the target.
Eliminate the recipient.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.446
Obtain the package.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.123
Mitch:
And what's the package?

43:37.198 --> 43:38.245
We'll know it
when we see it.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.665
You're lead.

43:41.744 --> 43:42.791
You're backup.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.170
(speaking Turkish)

44:10.189 --> 44:12.112
(conversing in Turkish)

44:16.654 --> 44:18.531
He thinks we're married.

44:25.413 --> 44:27.415
<i>Don't think too much.</i>

44:27.498 --> 44:29.000
You'll lose your nerve.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.294
No, I don't think so.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.844
It'll be your first time.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.387
Yeah, not in my mind.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.998
Lead, your friend's
arriving now.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.325
Victor: <i>Copy.</i>

45:11.792 --> 45:14.716
And he brought a shitload
of military protection.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.978
<i>Hurley:
I'll take care of the MPs.</i>

45:31.020 --> 45:33.114
Oh, come on, now, honey.
Don't be mad.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.233
No, no, no.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.568
I had a few. Yeah, I did.

45:36.651 --> 45:37.903
I'll make it up to you
when I get home.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.407
You know that.

45:42.114 --> 45:43.457
(both speaking Turkish)

45:51.582 --> 45:54.802
Call it in. Call it in,

Why does this kid give you
such a fucking hard-on?

53:15.693 --> 53:17.616
Don't talk to me like that!
I'm your superior.

<i>Hurley:

That's an affirmative.

Can you give us a minute?

53:37.631 --> 53:38.848
Look at this.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.602
The trigger must have been
in that car.

<i>The only thing

54:02.531 --> 54:04.124
is that fucking lunatic
has everything he needs

54:04.199 --> 54:05.246
to build a nuclear weapon.

54:07.202 --> 54:10.752
Stan: He's got a trigger.
Now he needs to buy a physicist.

54:10.831 --> 54:12.504
We just have to figure out

54:12.583 --> 54:14.426
where they're gonna
build this thing.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.970
Ben.

54:17.045 --> 54:19.924
That computer our boy Rapp
lifted from Sharif's house,

54:20.007 --> 54:23.261
there's evidence of a $2 million
transfer to a bank account in Rome.

54:23.343 --> 54:24.970
Cash prepped
for withdrawal.

I've been reading up, Minister.

55:54.810 --> 55:57.939
You Iranians probably
all learn this growing up,

55:58.021 --> 56:00.149
or at least you did before
you signed that treaty.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.528
But me, I had no idea
about these fun facts.

56:06.780 --> 56:08.282
Yeah, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

56:10.826 --> 56:13.955
Inside three miles,
apparently you just vaporize.

56:14.037 --> 56:16.210
Some folks don't.

56:16.290 --> 56:18.384
They get all
black and charred,

56:18.458 --> 56:22.588
and dense as lead,
and no one knows why.

56:22.671 --> 56:26.141
Inside five miles,
everything is sucked into a void,

56:26.216 --> 56:28.435
hotter than
the core of the sun.

56:31.388 --> 56:32.856
How about that?

56:33.891 --> 56:36.485
(speaking other language)

56:36.560 --> 56:38.938
You'll get the rest of your money
when the job's done.

56:39.021 --> 56:40.318
(speaking other language)

56:42.524 --> 56:44.322
Where is my physicist?

56:44.401 --> 56:46.699
He'll pick up his money,
then we'll pick him up.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.247
(Javeed speaking
other language)

56:49.323 --> 56:52.076
We'll need an extra day to configure
the weapon, then it's all yours.

56:52.159 --> 56:54.332
Kill as many Jews
as you want.

56:58.165 --> 57:01.339
Do you practice
Salah, brother?

57:01.418 --> 57:04.797
I receive my payment,
complete the project.

57:06.006 --> 57:08.475
That's my practice, brother.

57:08.550 --> 57:09.597
Very well.

57:42.793 --> 57:43.919
Mitch:
Who was that guy?

57:44.544 --> 57:45.887
In Istanbul.

57:48.382 --> 57:50.931
It seemed like he was
a step ahead of us.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.685
Hey, you gonna fill me in
here or what?

57:55.764 --> 57:58.108
There's some bad people planning
on doing some bad things,

57:58.183 --> 57:59.400
and it's ourjob
to stop them.

58:02.396 --> 58:04.194
You still haven't said
anything about Victor.

58:04.272 --> 58:06.866
Victor's gone.
Victor doesn't exist.

58:12.656 --> 58:14.909
What is it you think
we do here, Rapp?

58:18.328 --> 58:20.171
I think we kill people
who need to be killed.

58:20.247 --> 58:21.248
And who do you trust
to tell you?

58:21.331 --> 58:22.674
I follow orders.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.467
No, you follow orders
when they suit you.

58:24.543 --> 58:25.886
This whole thing
is pretty much

58:25.961 --> 58:28.840
just a means to an end
for you, isn't it?

58:28.922 --> 58:30.390
A lot's happened
in my life, sir.

58:30.465 --> 58:32.433
- Really? Huh.
- Yeah.

58:32.509 --> 58:33.761
So you think
you were sent here

58:33.844 --> 58:36.188
as an outlet
for your self-pity,

58:36.263 --> 58:39.437
and your anger,
and all your guilt. Right?

58:40.809 --> 58:42.777
Patriotism exists

58:42.853 --> 58:46.858
because people like you and people
like me need a higher cause.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.068
Something bigger than us.

58:49.151 --> 58:51.028
That stink coming outta you

58:51.111 --> 58:53.955
you like to call "revenge,"
the rest of us call “shit."

58:54.031 --> 58:55.624
And as soon as
it starts to feel good,

58:55.699 --> 58:57.417
that's when you stop
being a professional.

58:57.492 --> 58:58.744
And then what are you?

59:05.042 --> 59:07.044
Tell us something good,
darling.

59:07.127 --> 59:08.925
We're in their system.

59:11.006 --> 59:15.056
The moment that transfer from
Sharif's account is picked up,

59:15.135 --> 59:17.012
we'll know it.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.939
Boy, you just smile,
and the Red Sea parts.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.143
Works in the Med, too.

59:23.226 --> 59:25.729
I'll bet it does.

59:25.812 --> 59:27.439
(indistinct chattering)

59:30.650 --> 59:32.027
(cell phone chimes)

59:39.534 --> 59:43.084
Cash withdrawal from Sharif's account.
$2 million, U.S.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.913
There's our physicist.
Let's go.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.764
Welcome to the Boscolo
and enjoy your stay.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.432
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:28.060
He's in 1448.

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.861
And we're next door.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.097
(cell phone ringing)

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:00.843
Code in.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:01.973
Victor-Charlie 1109.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.725
<i>Hurley:
Confirmed.</i>

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:06.022
<i>Mitch: Suite 1448.
We're in 1449, right next door.</i>

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:09.101
All right.
We'll grab the physicist,

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.357
<i>and we'll take out whosever
coming for him.</i>

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:12.983
Signal every 15 minutes.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:55.738
<i>Hey -</i>

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.167
I know what happened
to you.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.833
I'm sorry.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:19.554
I understand you.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.098
More than you know.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.481
I know what it's like
to lose people you love.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.908
We're gonna get
these fuckers.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:57.459
(groans)

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.543
Fuck!

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.053
Where the hell are you?

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.029
Hurley...

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.580
Where is he?

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:30.412
I don't know
what you're talking--

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:33.829
(grunts)

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:35.755
(Mitch breathing heavily)

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:46.508
(groans)

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:48.892
Where is he?

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:50.728
He outside?

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.436
(grunting)

01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:58.520
(man groans)

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:17.580
(screaming)

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:36.516
(groans)

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:38.689
Bartosh:
Please, no.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.985
(speaking other language)

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:42.522
Please.

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:46.693
<i>Mitch:
Hurley, what the fuck?</i>

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.198
I thought you were eyes on,
why didn't you spot 'em?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.622
They were already
in the damn hotel.

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.165
<i>Local mafia 's
working with 'em.</i>

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.715
I'll tell Kennedy
we have the physicist.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.642
What the hell just happened
out there, huh?

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.435
That's twice now this guy's
blown up our entire op.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.933
What's the target?
Huh? What's the target?

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.139
- I don't know, mister.
- Yeah, you do.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.812
Huh?

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:19.893
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.649
He's an American.
He said your name.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.150
Did you train this guy?

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:26.483
- You like to smoke?
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.034
- Are you a smoker?
- Bartosh: <i>I</i> don't--

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.861
- Wait!
- Bad habit.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:32.322
Wait, stop! Wait, wait!
I know something.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.873
- What do you know?
- I know something.

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:37.748
There is a man-- There is
a man they call Ghost.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:41.832
Ghost. I think it was
an Iranian man said it.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:42.916
Uh-huh. Where are they
building the bomb?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.296
- I <i>just</i> took <i>the money.
- Where are they building it?</i>

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.252
Where are they building it?

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.179
All right, here.
Take some time to think about it.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.633
Ghost. ls that his name?

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.270
Why is this guy after you?

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.018
Something personal, sir?

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.723
They're building a nuke.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.770
Hotel Navona.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.571
- Clean yourself up.
- Wait.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.991
(Bartosh grunting)
Don't go.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.869
<i>News Anchor: America's president
has ordered the Sixth Fleet</i>

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.197
<i>out of the U.S. Naval base
in Naples, Italy.</i>

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.748
<i>The Sixth Fleet is now
southwest off the coast...</i>

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:18.242
Let me help you.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:19.543
No, it's okay.
I'm fine.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:20.871
You're not.

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:23.377
(Sighs)

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:40.856
How are you holding up?

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.988
I was afraid today.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.816
I thought
we were going to die.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.152
Yeah, I'm either always afraid
or never afraid.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.737
I don't know which.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.301
There you go.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.639
Just relax now.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.402
We'll search for
Ghost tomorrow.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.044
(gasps) You scared me.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.962
Who are you?

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:47.131
What do you mean?

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:49.459
You said “Ghost."

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.715
- What about him?
- I never told you that name.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.261
Hurley did.

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.180
Yeah, I think
you're full of shit.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.553
- Mitch.
- Who are you?

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.305
- Mitch, what's wrong with you?
- Who do you work for?

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:00.473
I'm CIA.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.680
Now don't fucking lie to me!

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:03.890
I'm not lying!

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.060
You're Iranian, aren't you?

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.486
Get the fuck away from me!

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.481
(groans)

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:14.901
(choking)

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.698
Are you working
with the Iranians?

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.500
(coughing)

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.794
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth!

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.880
(speaking other language)

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.095
You Iranian intelligence?

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.269
Are you Iranian intelligence?

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:51.774
What do you know
about Ghost?

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:13.501
<i>CIA Officer:
We're gonna need the decryption device.</i>

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.054
You were right, Mitch.

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:23.603
This Iranian mole
is a tough nut to crack.

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:26.022
All I could get from her
was her handler. Azad Ashani.

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.314
Happens to be
a friend of mine.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:28.767
I'm gonna go
pay him a visit.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.069
- Okay, I'm going with you.
- No.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.612
I need you to stay here.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:34.314
Kennedy's on her way
with the CIA team

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.398
and a Mossad team.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.698
She's gonna ask me
where you went.

01:10:36.774 --> 01:10:37.775
What the hell
am I supposed to say?

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:39.532
That's right, she is.
And you're gonna be smart,

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:40.953
and you're gonna
keep your mouth shut,

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:42.575
and you're gonna
cover my ass.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.075
(door closes)

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:08.681
I still have it.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.312
(chuckles)

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.152
Very nice.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.736
I am always happy
to meet you, Stan...

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.655
But never happy why.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:25.365
Well, maybe next time
we'll meet for pizza.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.495
Your girl's tough,
by the way.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:31.295
Go easy on her.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.462
She's my niece.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.166
Yeah.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.051
What have you got for me?

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:48.388
The men behind all this
are General Rostami,

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.894
our military
chief of staff,

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.772
and our defense minister,
Behruz.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:56.024
Both are very powerful,

01:11:56.103 --> 01:12:00.233
and both are very angry about
the nuclear treaty we made with you.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.114
They have been
trying to acquire

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.992
nuclear materials
for the past two years.

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:06.288
And they are the ones

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:09.243
who hired the mercenary
called Ghost.

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:15.207
Rostami is now in Tehran,
but Behruz is here in Rome.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:20.170
Annika has been tracking
his movements through his cell phone.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:21.379
And they're
building it here?

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.055
I wish I knew.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.762
We have their physicist.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:26.843
They can't build it
without him.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:27.927
But...

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.977
The mercenary asked Behruz

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:34.809
to use one of ours,
an Iranian.

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:38.567
Behruz agreed.
That was rash.

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:40.444
It means
they are in a hurry.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.236
And the target's Israel?

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.196
I wish I had
better information for you.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.497
(gunshot)
(groans)

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:50.495
(Hurley groans)

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.214
Where the hell is Hurley?

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:58.883
You gotta tell me
what's going on here. Now.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.881
That guy he trained,
who the hell is he?

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.712
That's not something you
need to know right now.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.797
What are you covering up?

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.849
When you've got a level-5
security clearance

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.426
and 20 years' experience,
talk to me.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.352
Until then,
shut up and do your job.

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:18.478
<i>I want her cell phone
decrypted and scanned.</i>

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.279
<i>Ben: Local PD pulled a <i>body
from the harbor an hour ago.</i></i>

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.355
<i>Gunshot to the chest.</i>

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.908
Iranian intelligence officer,
Azad Ashani.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.236
Christ!

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:27.992
That's the guy
Hurley went to meet.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.993
Stupid son of a bitch!

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.665
All right, so what do we do?
We gotta go after him.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.994
There's a fucking nuke
in play, Rapp.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:37.376
That's the mission,
and the only mission.

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.082
This is now a joint
CIA-Mossad operation,

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:40.462
whether we like it or not.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:41.793
Can you get the Director
on the phone?

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:44.004
So you're just gonna
write him off then?

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.838
That's the plan?

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:48.095
Stan Hurley is the closest
thing to family I've got.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.300
And if he were
standing here right now,

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:50.475
his only question would be,

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:52.394
why are we wasting our breath
talking about him?

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.556
You're through here.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.062
You're going home,
that's an order.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.527
<i>Now, sit down
and shut up.</i>

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:54.119
Why are you helping me?

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:56.075
Your handler Ashani
was killed.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.876
Hurley was with him.
Something happened.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:58.999
I'm going after him.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.044
I need your help.

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:06.377
We gotta go.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.946
<i>Ghost: Stan.</i>

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.158
I've looked forward to this.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.163
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:40.874
I wanna show you something.

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:42.330
All right.

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:56.807
Savages. Right, Stan?

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:01.274
But you know something?
I don't blame them.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:03.684
I blame you.

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:05.190
Never would've happened

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:06.441
if you would have
followed orders, Ronnie.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.488
<i>"You go down out there,
you're a ghost.</i>

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.907
"You're a John Doe.

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:12.235
"You get captured?"

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.696
Oh, you remember.
That's very gratifying.

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:15.780
Thank you.

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:17.365
You made me proud
today, Ron.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.452
You should've come for me.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.417
Ten men would've died.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:25.874
You put 10 men's lives
in danger,

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:27.924
'cause you couldn't follow
a fucking order.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.297
- Fuck you.
- Ghost: <i>Fuck</i> orders.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:30.969
<i>- Fuck the mission!
- Fuck you.</i>

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:33.423
This was me.
I was your boy, I believe that.

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:34.553
You made me believe that.

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:47.027
Ashani had their people
tracking Minister Behruz's

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:48.195
secure cell phone.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.365
Mitch:
So, we find Behruz, we find Hurley.

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:54.319
(sirens wailing)

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.292
Mitch!

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:04.086
(driver speaking Italian)

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.203
(horns honking)

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.714
<i>Hurley:
Oh, yeah, look at that.</i>

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.340
Did you learn that
in Aleppo?

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.763
No.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:57.840
You always told us
what to expect, Stan.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.930
Now,

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.015
where's the rest of
your team?

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.060
(laughs)
Come on, Ronnie, really?

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:10.895
Don't call me that.
Where's the rest of your team?

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:13.447
Your new boy out there,
he on my tail?

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.742
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
There's your first mistake.

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:19.741
You never start
with a real question.

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.914
You start slow.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:23.787
You get inside
your subject's head.

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:27.541
Stan, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.294
(sighs) There's your
second mistake. Number two.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:33.125
You don't say, "one more time."
You already--

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.927
(groaning) Damn!

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:38.047
(shudders)

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:41.225
Now, what's that
third mistake, Stan?

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.177
Huh? What is it?

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.103
Go ahead! Go ahead!

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:47.523
I got nine more! I like this.

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:49.942
<i>l like it.
Go ahead, bring it on!</i>

01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:51.143
You motherfucker!

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:54.071
(man speaking other language)

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:56.569
Ronnie wants to know
if I got a team outside.

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:57.775
Right, Ron?

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.326
If it's safe
to move your bomb.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:01.745
(speaks other language)

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.072
Are we being followed?

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.498
(speaks other language)

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.496
Where's the new me?

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.998
I've done my research.
I know all about him.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.627
"The new me..."
Oh, you mean Mitch?

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.924
You know, Mitch,
he's unpredictable.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:15.592
You never know about Mitch.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.090
He might be here,
he might be there.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.842
He's like you, but you're
a real Section 8.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:19.922
Enough.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:22.133
<i>- Schizo mom.
- Where are they?</i>

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:23.763
- Loser dad.
- Where are they?

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:25.932
(groaning)

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.137
God!

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.021
Where's the rest of
your team?

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:33.603
Half-wit mom, psycho dad--

01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:34.812
Where's the rest of
your team?

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:36.272
- You're pond scum.
- Where are they?

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.608
Pond scum!
You're fucking--

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.989
(electricity crackling)
(groaning)

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.752
I'm sorry
about your handler.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.164
Ashani was my uncle.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.134
I'm sure
it was Minister Behruz

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.712
and General Rostami
who had him killed.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.890
<i>They want nuclear war
with Israel.</i>

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.717
<i>We tried to stop them.</i>

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.519
My brother and father
both died fighting them.

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.357
Corviale. Turn here.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:19.190
You know what
my real mistake was?

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.576
I trusted you.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.621
You made me feel like
I was the Second Coming.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.454
And you acted like my father.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:36.007
I trusted you and I trusted
the United States Navy.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.044
(Hurley groaning)

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.890
U.S. of A. does it, it's gotta be good.
Right, Stan?

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:49.978
Except

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:53.228
nobody told me the business
y'all are really in.

01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:58.400
You create monsters.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:20:59.856
That's just what you do.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:03.529
Those people
who did this to me,

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.782
you think
they're barbarians?

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.617
Bullshit.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.241
(groaning)

01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:17.293
Where's the decryption
I asked for?

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:20.217
Rapp grabbed her smartphone
before we could get any of it.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.420
And we can't find him.

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:24.221
Surveillance cameras
picked up Rapp

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:26.298
<i>taking out our agents
five minutes ago.</i>

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.433
What the hell are you doing?

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.647
There's not a single thing
happening here

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:42.947
that you didn't make happen.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:48.362
God bless fucking America,
huh, Stan?

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:51.156
Hoorah!

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.167
Hoorah!

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.334
<i>I can tell you
where Mitch is...</i>

01:21:57.413 --> 01:22:00.257
<i>Ghost:
What's that third mistake, Stan?</i>

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.333
Mitch...

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:02.418
I can't hear you.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:03.502
(Ghost groans)

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.586
Fuck!

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:10.843
<i>Third mistake,</i>

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.600
never get too close.

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.773
Finish your
personal business here.

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:17.191
<i>Your work is done.</i>

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:18.734
The bomb is armed.

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:20.402
- Timer is set up?
- Yes.

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:21.478
He's playing you.

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:23.656
<i>Bomb's not for you,
it's for him.</i>

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:25.323
<i>It was his plan all along!</i>

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:58.724
Dead zone.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:01.105
We're not getting
any signals here.

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.311
(Mitch sighs)

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.533
<i>Mitch:
Come on. Come on.</i>

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.327
<i>Wait a second.</i>

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.472
(speaks other language)

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:38.563
(men speaking other language)

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.516
What are you gonna do
with it?

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:42.021
Ghost:
No, Stan.

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:44.732
"What are we gonna do
with it?"

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:50.075
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:52.611
I like Rome.

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:53.741
It's good food.

01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:01.959
Never, ever thought
I'd die in the field.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.256
Ain't it crazy?

01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:08.302
I always figured it would be,
I don't know,

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:12.757
some cabin in the woods
with my dog.

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:14.432
Ghost: Me?

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.761
I think I want water.

01:24:16.843 --> 01:24:19.938
There's just something
peaceful about dying at sea.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:25.936
All right.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:29.569
Let's get it over with.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.901
No, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:33.031
I ain't gonna kill you.

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:35.283
You're gonna live to see

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.285
the crown of
your creation, Stan.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:41.498
Thousands of Americans
are gonna burn.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:44.288
<i>All because of you.</i>

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.458
Enjoy the show.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:50.586
Get ready.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.415
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:31.752
Go.

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:56.318
(man speaking other language)

01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:27.607
(man grunting weakly)

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:39.323

<i>A half click

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.178
It's underground.

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.978
- Delta One, go!
- Let's go.

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.681
<i>Irene: Get a <i>chopper out there.</i></i>

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.047
You're not supposed
to be here, Rapp.

01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:06.007
Yeah, what are you
gonna do, fire me?

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:08.560
There's another passage down there.
He's got the nuke.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.763
- You gonna be good?
- Go. Go!

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.815

<i>Or she's dead.</i>

01:29:56.016 --> 01:29:58.018
I want to see
my family, Mitch.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.904
No, Annika, you don't.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.448
I want to see my family.

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:05.571

Come on, Mitch. Be nice.

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:07.152
<i>She wants to live.</i>

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:09.363
She wants to see her family.

01:30:09.446 --> 01:30:10.447
Put the gun down.

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.076

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:14.154
The bomb can't be stopped.

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:15.534
Just like you couldn't stop

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:18.207
that beautiful girl from
dying on the beach.

01:32:22.912 --> 01:32:24.084
Irene.

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.129
The bomb's on a boat.

<i>Irene:
Hurley?</i>

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:29.760
How do you know?

01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:32.339
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:38.602
ls the Sixth Fleet

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:42.269
Irene:
Oh, my God.

01:32:42.348 --> 01:32:43.349
Bring up ISR feeds.

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:45.106
Get me eyes in the sky
over the coastline

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:47.779
and put the Sixth Fleet
on nuclear alert.

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.272
<i>Tom.</i>

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:52.825
<i>The target is the Sixth Fleet

01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:01.743
It's a shame.

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:06.172
The last thing your girl saw
was you not saving her.

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:07.624
(laughs)

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.181

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.948
Didn't Hurley teach you
anything, little brother?

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:43.953
To never make it personal.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.001
(yen-s)

01:33:55.213 --> 01:33:56.760
This isn't personal.

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:05.769
Shit.

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:10.357
The bomb has a timer
and a release trigger.

01:34:10.436 --> 01:34:13.064
We take out his boat,
it'll detonate.

01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.071
If it goes off
above the waterline...

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:18.029
Disaster. There'll be fallout
all over the mainland.

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:22.699
<i>USS Flynn...</i>

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:24.580

The boat

01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:38.468
Who's driving that boat?

01:34:41.926 --> 01:34:42.927
RaPP-

01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:47.140
Go.

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:49.146

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:00.536

<i>Hurley: Trying to get our boy

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:08.662
Do not fire, Commander.
The boat is turning.

01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:11.544
Captain: <i>If we don't engage,
that guarantees detonation.</i>

01:35:11.623 --> 01:35:12.875
I understand there's a risk,

01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:14.379
but this is the best chance
we've got.

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:16.427
Shit! God damn it!

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:26.228
There he is.

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:28.352
<i>Get me on that boat's

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:33.228

01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:40.990
Throw the bomb overboard!

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:43.242
No way, sir, I gotta get
further away from the fleet!

01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:44.743

The bomb's in the water.

Hold fire!

01:36:09.514 --> 01:36:10.936
<i>Hold fire!</i>

01:36:41.087 --> 01:36:42.964
Got less than 30 seconds.

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:47.935
All right, go!
Get outta here!

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:09.615
Jesus.

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:49.765

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:55.972
Brace!

01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:38.848
You shouldn't have
come for me.

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:42.648
Don't get used to it, son.

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.104
(laughs)

01:39:45.062 --> 01:39:47.565
Hurley...

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:49.992

be all right up here.

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:51.819
lthink.

01:39:56.407 --> 01:39:59.286

Low... Low levels.

Commander,
any casualties?

01:40:12.256 --> 01:40:14.133
The <i>Flynn</i> took
some serious damage.

01:40:14.217 --> 01:40:16.094
The casualty reports
aren't in yet,

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:19.147
but if it had gone off above the
waterline, I don't think we'd be here.

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:49.801
Hold on a minute.

01:40:54.924 --> 01:40:56.016
Yeah, go ahead.

01:40:56.092 --> 01:40:57.594
You okay, Mitch?

01:40:57.677 --> 01:40:59.429
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.648
You saved
a lot of lives today.

01:41:08.396 --> 01:41:10.023
Took some losses, too.

01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:16.802
What the hell
are you looking at?

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:18.599
You look like a mummy.

01:42:18.674 --> 01:42:20.051
Yeah.

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:22.136
Well...

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:24.313
A mummy doesn't have to
write up reports.

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:26.766
Dictate them.
You should be good at that.
