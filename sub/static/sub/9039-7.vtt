WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:04.933
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.833
- OH, HI, MA.

00:06.833 --> 00:08.067
- HOW'S YOUR BOOK COMING?

00:08.067 --> 00:09.333
- GOOD. YEAH.

00:09.333 --> 00:10.833
- IT IS SO EXCITING

00:10.833 --> 00:12.500
TO SEE YOU
WRITING A BOOK.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.567
- OH, THANKS.

00:13.567 --> 00:14.733
THANK YOU, MA.

00:14.733 --> 00:17.300
- DOES IT HAVE
TO BE ABOUT SPORTS?

00:19.567 --> 00:21.033
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S EITHER THAT

00:21.033 --> 00:23.233
OR ABOUT MOTHERS
WHO CAN'T LET GO.

00:23.233 --> 00:25.700
- [laughs]
- YEAH.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.033
[laughing]

00:27.033 --> 00:28.500
- LISTEN, DEBRA MENTIONED

00:28.500 --> 00:31.067
YOU MIGHT NEED SOMEONE
TO HELP YOU GET ORGANIZED.

00:31.067 --> 00:32.733
- OH, SHE DID.
- MM-HMM.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.633
- YEAH.
YEAH.

00:34.633 --> 00:37.533
ISN'T THAT NICE HOW SHE
MENTIONS THINGS TO YOU?

00:38.933 --> 00:41.700
LISTEN, MOM,
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

00:41.700 --> 00:43.367
BUT I DON'T--
I DON'T NEED ANY--

00:43.367 --> 00:45.400
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT ME, RAYMOND.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.400
ALTHOUGH I'D BE
A TERRIFIC GAL FRIDAY.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.267
NO, NO, NO, IT'S--I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOUR COUSIN GERARD.

00:52.267 --> 00:55.567
- GERARD?
OH, I DON'T LIKE GERARD.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.233
- YES, YOU DO.

00:58.967 --> 01:00.967
- ISN'T HE ALWAYS
IN THE HOSPITAL?

01:00.967 --> 01:03.233
- WELL,
HE'S A FRAGILE BOY.

01:03.233 --> 01:05.467
I MEAN, HE--HE HAS
ALLERGIES,

01:05.467 --> 01:07.133
AND HE HAS A POOR
SENSE OF BALANCE,

01:07.133 --> 01:09.000
BUT HE'S
MUCH BETTER NOW.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.367
- I DON'T NEED ANYBODY, MA,
ESPECIALLY GERARD.

01:13.367 --> 01:17.133
- I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT GERARD
IS A VERY RESPONSIBLE YOUNG MAN.

01:17.133 --> 01:19.833
AND HE'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED.

01:19.833 --> 01:22.733
AND I OWE HIS MOTHER.

01:22.733 --> 01:24.033
- FOR WHAT?

01:24.033 --> 01:25.600
- WELL, YOU KNOW
WHEN ROBERT GOT DIVORCED?

01:25.600 --> 01:27.967
SHE SET HIM UP
WITH MELISSA.

01:27.967 --> 01:29.300
- I DON'T THINK
YOU OWE SOMEONE

01:29.300 --> 01:32.733
FOR SETTING UP A GUY
WITH HIS OWN COUSIN.

01:32.733 --> 01:34.267
- IT WAS JUST
TO TALK.

01:34.267 --> 01:36.200
THEY HAD A LOT
IN COMMON.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.800
- YEAH, DNA.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.467
NO, MA, NO--
PLEASE.

01:41.467 --> 01:42.800
- COME ON.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.167
RAYMOND,

01:44.167 --> 01:45.733
DO I ASK FOR MUCH?

01:48.600 --> 01:51.367
I THINK YOU COULD DO
THIS ONE THING FOR ME...

01:51.367 --> 01:55.800
WHILE I'M STILL HERE.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.233
- YOU MEAN
IN THE BASEMENT?

01:59.867 --> 02:01.000
ALL RIGHT!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.267
RELAX.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

02:03.267 --> 02:04.433
I MEAN SPIRITUALLY.

02:04.433 --> 02:05.800
PHYSICALLY,
GET THE HELL OUT.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.100
I'LL ASK HIM.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.100
- YOU'LL ASK HIM?

02:08.100 --> 02:09.433
- YEAH, YEAH.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.633
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
- OKAY.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.233
- TELL HIM
TO CALL ME TOMORROW.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.200
- GERARD, COME ON DOWN!

02:14.200 --> 02:16.700
- WHAT? HE'S HERE?
- YEAH.

02:33.067 --> 02:35.300
- HIYA, RAYMOND.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.400
- HIYA, GERARD.

02:41.933 --> 02:44.133
SO YOU'RE, UH...

02:44.133 --> 02:45.667
YOU'RE OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.633
- YEAH.
- YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.733
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GREAT.

02:52.967 --> 02:56.733
- RAYMOND.
- WHAT?

02:56.733 --> 03:00.600
SO, UH, GERARD, WOULD YOU, UH,
BE INTERESTED IN...

03:00.600 --> 03:03.967
UH, HELPING ME OUT
AROUND HERE?

03:03.967 --> 03:07.733
- UH...OKAY.

03:07.733 --> 03:09.400
- YEAH, OKAY.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.733
- WELL, I'LL LEAVE
YOU TWO BUDDIES TO GET TO WORK.

03:13.733 --> 03:16.067
I'LL BE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
IF YOU NEED ME.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.633
- OKAY, THANK YOU, MA.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.167
- OH, AND, GERARD, DON'T FORGET
TO TELL YOUR MOTHER

03:19.167 --> 03:20.700
THAT WE'RE EVEN NOW.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.433
- DO YOU MIND
IF I SIT?

03:33.433 --> 03:36.467
SOMETIMES MY LEGS
GIVE OUT UNEXPECTEDLY.

03:36.467 --> 03:40.267
- OH, YEAH.
YEAH, GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.

03:40.267 --> 03:41.800
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS

03:41.800 --> 03:42.867
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

03:42.867 --> 03:44.433
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:44.433 --> 03:46.033
- WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE FORCED

03:46.033 --> 03:47.800
INTO DOING SOMETHING
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.433
- I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING WEIRD, AM I?

03:51.433 --> 03:54.400
- WHAT?
NO, NO. NO, NO, NO.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.433
- I MEAN,
WE ARE IN A BASEMENT.

03:57.433 --> 03:59.200
REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD
THAT IDEA--

03:59.200 --> 04:00.600
- WE WERE SEVEN.

04:07.167 --> 04:08.433
ALL RIGHT.

04:08.433 --> 04:10.000
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.500
GOOD.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.833
UH, SO THE BOOK I'M WRITING
IS ABOUT BASEBALL.

04:13.833 --> 04:16.167
YOU FOLLOW BASEBALL?

04:16.167 --> 04:20.400
- YOU WANT ME TO SAY YES,
DON'T YOU?

04:20.400 --> 04:22.667
- I'M JUST ASKING.

04:22.667 --> 04:26.033
- YES.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.800
- OKAY.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.933
UH, I WAS THINKING--
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO

04:29.933 --> 04:32.900
IS READ WHAT I'VE ALREADY DONE
AND KIND OF PROOFREAD IT.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.500
- OH, NO.
- WHAT?

04:35.500 --> 04:38.400
- I GOT A STAIN ON MY SHIRT.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.100
I WANTED TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.533
I SUCK.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.900
- OKAY, SO ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS KIND OF...

04:51.900 --> 04:54.167
JUST CHECK FOR SPELLING
AND PUNCTUATION, YOU KNOW?

04:54.167 --> 04:55.533
HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:55.533 --> 04:57.767
JUST HIGHLIGHT ANYTHING
THAT YOU SEE IS WRONG.

04:57.767 --> 05:01.900
THAT'S ALL.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.100
- OH, BOY.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.567
- WHAT, ALREADY?
FOUND SOMETHING ALREADY?

05:05.567 --> 05:07.633
- DO I HAVE TO USE
THIS HIGHLIGHTER?

05:07.633 --> 05:10.133
- WHY? WHY?
WHAT'S WRONG?

05:10.133 --> 05:14.033
- THIS IS REALLY
THROWING OFF FUMES.

05:14.033 --> 05:18.000
I'M GETTING HIGH HERE.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.467
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

05:21.467 --> 05:23.167
- HOW ABOUT
THAT RED PENCIL?

05:23.167 --> 05:26.133
- I'M USING IT.
I'M USING THE RED PENCIL.

05:26.133 --> 05:29.033
- OKAY.
LISTEN, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.267
- ALL RIGHT, HERE.
HERE, HERE, HERE.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.000
TAKE IT.
TAKE THE PENCIL.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.733
- THANK YOU.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.733
"SANDY KOUFAX, NOLAN RYAN,
TO NAME A FEW.

05:44.733 --> 05:45.933
WHILE THESE MEN..."

05:45.933 --> 05:47.400
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.267
- YEAH, IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S GOOD.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.667
WHATEVER.
- WAIT.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.767
GERARD, IF THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG, YOU GOT TO TELL ME.

05:53.767 --> 05:56.133
- NO, IT'S JUST...
I DON'T KNOW.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.567
DOESN'T "WHORE"
HAVE A "W"?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.400
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:00.400 --> 06:02.133
- YOU CALLED SOME GUY
A WHORE IN HERE, AND I--

06:02.133 --> 06:04.467
- WAIT. WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE!
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.767
I DON'T CALL A GUY A WHORE
IN MY BOOK.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.967
- YES, YOU DO.

06:07.967 --> 06:12.533
"LOU GEHRIG WAS THE IRON HORE,"
H-O-R-E.

06:12.533 --> 06:14.833
- HORSE!
SEE, I FORGOT THE "S."

06:14.833 --> 06:16.500
HE WAS THE IRON HORSE.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.700
- OH.

06:17.700 --> 06:21.200
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE EITHER.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.800
- BUT THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A TYPO.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.433
THAT'S A TYPO.
THANKS.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.100
- YEAH, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE
FOUND IT EVENTUALLY.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.467
- NO, BUT--
BUT YOU FOUND IT.

06:27.467 --> 06:29.300
- OR SOMEONE ELSE
WOULD HAVE.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.667
- GERARD, YOU DID IT.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.300
YOU FOUND SOMETHING.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.600
- I-I MIGHT HAVE MISSED
SOMETHING ELSE, THOUGH.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.267
I THINK I WAS DISTRACTED
BY THAT "WHORE."

06:37.267 --> 06:39.300
- IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT "WHORE"!

06:39.300 --> 06:42.200
I DON'T WRITE "WHORE"
IN MY BOOK.

06:55.467 --> 06:58.000
- HEY, HOW DID IT GO
WITH GERARD TODAY?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.767
- YEAH, THANKS FOR MENTIONING
THINGS TO MY MOM, PEPPERSQUAT.

07:01.767 --> 07:03.367
- WHAT?

07:03.367 --> 07:04.600
- I CAN'T GET
ANY WORK DONE.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.400
HE'S ALLERGIC
TO THE PEN,

07:06.400 --> 07:11.300
AND HE KEEPS ASKING ME
STUPID QUESTIONS.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.600
- YOU GOT TO JUST GIVE THE GUY
A CHANCE, YOU KNOW?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.367
- YOU TRY SPENDING THE DAY
IN THE BASEMENT WITH HIM.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.900
HE'S GOT SOMETHING NEGATIVE
TO SAY ABOUT EVERYTHING,

07:20.900 --> 07:22.767
EVEN WHEN I COMPLIMENT HIM.

07:22.767 --> 07:27.233
AND HE KEEPS COMPLAINING
IN THAT NASAL, WHINY VOICE.

07:28.933 --> 07:32.467
"OH, NO,
I SPILLED WITE-OUT."

07:32.467 --> 07:35.267
- [laughing]

07:36.600 --> 07:37.633
- WHAT?

07:37.633 --> 07:40.200
- YOU COULD BE TWINS.

07:42.033 --> 07:43.133
- WHAT?

07:43.133 --> 07:45.333
- HE SOUNDS
JUST LIKE YOU.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.100
- NO, HE DOESN'T.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.333
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S YOU.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.833
"OH, I SPILLED
THE WITE-OUT."

07:51.833 --> 07:54.200
- YEAH, THAT'S ME.
IT'S NOT ME.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.933
- AS A MATTER
OF FACT, YOU--

07:57.933 --> 07:59.333
- WHAT? WHAT?

07:59.333 --> 08:00.867
WHAT?
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

08:00.867 --> 08:03.733
- SOMETHING ABOUT THE KIDS.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.067
- YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I'M HIS TWIN.

08:07.067 --> 08:09.567
- NO, RAY,
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

08:09.567 --> 08:12.067
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

08:12.067 --> 08:13.333
- [sighs]

08:13.333 --> 08:14.800
IT'S JUST THAT...

08:14.800 --> 08:18.733
I NOTICED YOUR HEADS
ARE KIND OF THE SAME SHAPE.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.133
- HEADS?

08:32.033 --> 08:35.233
"OH, NO,
I SPILLED WITE-OUT."

08:42.467 --> 08:45.467
OH, MY GOD,
I AM GERARD.

08:45.467 --> 08:47.867
- NO, YOU'RE NOT, RAY.

08:47.867 --> 08:48.967
- HEY, I'M NOT BLIND.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.367
I CAN SEE AND HEAR IT.

08:50.367 --> 08:53.000
- NO, YOU'RE
FROM THE SAME FAMILY, OKAY?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.900
SO YOU SOUND A LITTLE BIT ALIKE.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.467
YOU HAVE
A FEW SIMILAR MANNERISMS.

08:56.467 --> 08:58.600
YOUR HEAD SHAPE
IS A TINY BIT THE SAME.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.000
BUT YOU'RE TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, OKAY?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.800
YOU'RE NOT GERARD.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.000
- OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.433
I KNOW.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

09:06.433 --> 09:09.300
I KNOW.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.533
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.033
YOU'RE A MUCH BETTER KISSER.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.467
- W--

09:19.400 --> 09:20.800
THAT'S--YOU KNOW--

09:20.800 --> 09:24.233
THAT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.
YOU HEAR ME?

09:24.233 --> 09:26.500
- I'M JUST KIDDING YOU.
GOOD NIGHT.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.167
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
I'M JUST SAYING...

09:29.167 --> 09:32.167
IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

09:34.967 --> 09:37.167
YOU GOT YOUR UNCLE'S BUTT.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.933
- SO YOU DON'T
LIVE HERE ANYMORE?

09:48.933 --> 09:51.933
- NO, NO, I'VE HAD MY OWN PLACE
FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW.

09:51.933 --> 09:53.300
YOU?

09:53.300 --> 09:55.267
- YEAH, 12 YEARS
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN.

09:55.267 --> 09:57.633
EIGHT IF YOU DON'T COUNT
THE HOSPITALS.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.100
- HEY.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.133
- HI.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.167
- HIYA, RAYMOND.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.367
- HIYA, GERARD.

10:04.367 --> 10:08.733
UH, GOOD MORNING, COUSIN.
YEAH.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.600
- HELLO, RAYMOND.
YOU HUNGRY, DEAR?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.767
I'M MAKING SOME EGGS
FOR YOU TOO.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.400
- IS THAT MY SHIRT?

10:14.400 --> 10:18.933
- OH, WELL, HE HAD A STAIN
ON HIS OTHER ONE.

10:18.933 --> 10:20.233
- ALL DONE, AUNT MARIE.

10:20.233 --> 10:21.933
DO YOU MIND IF I VISIT
YOUR RESTROOM?

10:21.933 --> 10:23.600
- NO, DEAR. GO AHEAD.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.200
- BE CAREFUL IN THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

10:25.200 --> 10:28.900
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GETTING MY PANTS!

10:28.900 --> 10:31.033
- WHERE IS HE GOING?

10:31.033 --> 10:33.400
- TAKE A WILD GUESS.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.600
- AGAIN?

10:34.600 --> 10:38.067
WHAT IS HE,
ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN?

10:38.067 --> 10:39.867
MARIE, HOW LONG
IS HE GONNA BE AROUND?

10:39.867 --> 10:41.500
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.967
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BE FINISHED
WITH YOUR BOOK, RAYMOND?

10:43.967 --> 10:45.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.300
- JEEZALOO.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.733
- I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.667
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOTHER
IS NOT WORTH THIS.

10:52.667 --> 10:53.633
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

10:53.633 --> 10:55.367
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME TO--

10:55.367 --> 10:59.100
- I KNOW, BUT HE'S
SUCH A MOPEY FELLOW.

10:59.100 --> 11:03.433
- "OH, NO...
MY LEG'S BOTHERING ME."

11:03.433 --> 11:05.167
- "OH..."

11:05.167 --> 11:07.767
- "OH, I'M ALLERGIC."

11:07.767 --> 11:10.500
[all whining]

11:10.500 --> 11:13.300
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE!

11:13.300 --> 11:15.700
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.033
- HE'S A SCHMO.

11:18.033 --> 11:20.533
HE'S GOT NO ZEST
FOR LIFE.

11:20.533 --> 11:22.567
- I MEAN,
HE'S VERY NEGATIVE.

11:22.567 --> 11:24.700
HOW DID YOU PUT IT,
ROBBIE?

11:24.700 --> 11:27.700
- LOSER.

11:29.367 --> 11:32.100
- AND HE ONLY
COMES OVER HERE TO EAT.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.433
YOUR EGGS
ARE READY, DEAR.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.200
- YOU KNOW, DEBRA THINKS
THAT I'M A LOT LIKE HIM.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.967
UH, WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

11:45.967 --> 11:47.300
- WHAT, DEAR?

11:47.300 --> 11:49.867
- IT WAS LIKE TIME FROZE
THERE FOR A SECOND,

11:49.867 --> 11:52.400
AND WHEN--

11:52.400 --> 11:53.667
WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?

11:56.933 --> 11:58.800
YOU AGREE WITH DEBRA.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.600
- NO, NOT AT ALL, DEAR.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.500
IT'S JUST THAT--

12:01.500 --> 12:03.167
- NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT--

12:03.167 --> 12:05.200
- [laughing]

12:05.200 --> 12:08.900
IT'S UNCANNY!

12:08.900 --> 12:10.667
- YOU THINK
I'M LIKE HIM.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.667
AND YOU THINK HE'S ANNOYING,
SO YOU THINK I'M ANNOYING.

12:12.667 --> 12:15.900
- UH, I BELIEVE
THAT'S THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.333
- THERE IS SOMETHING.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.667
- OH, RAYMOND.
NOBODY SAYS YOU'RE ANNOYING.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.333
YOU'RE JUST BLOWING
THIS WHOLE THING

12:21.333 --> 12:22.667
OUT OF PROPORTION.

12:22.667 --> 12:23.600
- OH, AM I?

12:23.600 --> 12:27.733
- YEAH.
I-I DON'T HATE YOU.

12:27.733 --> 12:31.067
I WONDER WHY THAT IS.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.700
- JUST SAY IT!
I'M ANNOYING!

12:32.700 --> 12:34.600
RIGHT?
I GOT THE SAME NASAL VOICE.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.700
UH, I LOOK DROOPY
LIKE HIM.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.067
I'M NEGATIVE.

12:38.067 --> 12:41.767
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I KNOW ALL THAT.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.533
IT'S JUST
IT'S DIFFERENT WITH YOU.

12:43.533 --> 12:46.700
I-I-I--DAMNED IF I KNOW
WHAT IT IS, THOUGH.

12:46.700 --> 12:47.833
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.567
YOU'RE OUR SON.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.567
- THAT'S IT!

12:52.567 --> 12:55.267
- WAIT.
WH-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:55.267 --> 12:56.967
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE USED TO YOU.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.133
- USED TO ME.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.200
- YES.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.633
THIS MEANS YOU ARE ANNOYING.

13:00.633 --> 13:03.467
WE'VE JUST DEVELOPED
A TOLERANCE FOR YOU.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.000
- TOLERANCE FOR ME?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.667
YOU TOLERATE ME.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.200
GOOD-BYE, EVERYBODY.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.167
- HEY, HEY!
DON'T GET MAD AT US.

13:15.167 --> 13:16.467
- COME ON,
HE'S RIGHT, DEAR.

13:16.467 --> 13:17.967
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CAME OVER HERE,

13:17.967 --> 13:19.633
ASKING US
IF YOU'RE ANNOYING.

13:19.633 --> 13:24.567
- WHICH, IN AND OF ITSELF,
IS QUITE ANNOYING.

13:24.567 --> 13:29.167
- WHY, HUH?
WHY IS THAT ANNOYING, ROBERT?

13:29.167 --> 13:33.167
- BECAUSE YOU ALREADY
KNOW THE ANSWER.

13:33.167 --> 13:35.433
SEE, THAT'S YOU
ALL OVER.

13:35.433 --> 13:37.033
DEBRA ALREADY
TOLD YOU YESTERDAY

13:37.033 --> 13:38.667
YOU WERE LIKE GERARD,
RIGHT?

13:38.667 --> 13:40.433
BUT IS THAT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

13:40.433 --> 13:45.433
NO, YOU HAVE TO CHECK
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

13:45.433 --> 13:48.600
POLL THE WORLD.
THEY WON'T MIND.

13:48.600 --> 13:54.533
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS REALLY
IMPORTANT, ARE THEY, RAYMOND?

13:54.533 --> 13:57.167
WHAT DO YOU THINK, WE'RE JUST
HANGING ON HOOKS OVER HERE,

13:57.167 --> 13:59.600
WAITING FOR YOU TO STOP BY?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.767
- HEY.
- HEY.

14:01.767 --> 14:04.267
- MY MOM SAYS NEXT TIME
THEY'RE WORKING ON MY SINUSES,

14:04.267 --> 14:06.033
THEY SHOULD DO
A WHOLE NOSE JOB.

14:06.033 --> 14:09.300
WH-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:10.467 --> 14:12.200
- WELL, WE WERE HAVING
A CONVERSATION

14:12.200 --> 14:13.700
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE,

14:13.700 --> 14:17.533
BUT WE COULD STOP TO ADDRESS
YOUR CONCERNS, GERARD.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.767
- HEY, ROBERT, YOU REALLY WANT
TO SEE ANNOYING?

14:21.767 --> 14:23.700
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK
IN THE MIRROR?

14:25.067 --> 14:27.233
- BRAVO.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.233
ALL RIGHT,
BREAK'S OVER.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.533
EVERYBODY BACK ON THE HOOKS.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.900
- HI, DADDY.
- HI, DADDY.

14:44.900 --> 14:48.133
- HEY. HI. HEY.
- HI, DAD.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.833
- YOU FORGOT SOMETHING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

14:49.833 --> 14:50.833
- WHAT?

14:50.833 --> 14:52.033
- THAT I'M ANNOYING.

14:52.033 --> 14:53.200
- WHAT?

14:53.200 --> 14:54.333
- YEAH, LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW--

14:54.333 --> 14:55.533
- HIYA, THERE.
- SHH!

14:55.533 --> 14:58.100
- HI, GERARD.
- HIYA, KIDS.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.033
GOT YOUR NOSE.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.667
- CAN I BE EXCUSED?

15:13.433 --> 15:15.000
- WELL, RAYMOND,
I'M PUNCHING IN.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.633
I'LL BE DOWN
IN THE SALT MINES.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.033
- OKAY.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.567
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

15:21.267 --> 15:23.900
ALL RIGHT,
I'M FIRING HIM.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.100
- WHY?
- WHY?

15:25.100 --> 15:26.600
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HATES ME.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.067
AND BEFORE HE GOT HERE,
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

15:30.067 --> 15:33.067
- OH, SO YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE IT OUT ON THAT POOR GUY?

15:33.067 --> 15:35.867
- YEAH.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.633
- CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION?

15:37.633 --> 15:38.933
- YOU WANT TO FIRE HIM?

15:38.933 --> 15:41.400
- NO, BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT YOURSELF

15:41.400 --> 15:42.667
THAT'S BOTHERING YOU,

15:42.667 --> 15:45.600
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
WORK ON YOU?

15:47.667 --> 15:50.133
- WHY DO I TALK
TO YOU?

15:51.933 --> 15:58.067
- [playing "Smoke on the Water"]

16:11.633 --> 16:12.733
- HEY.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.800
- OH, HEY.
SORRY.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.933
IS THERE
A SONG YOU LIKE?

16:17.933 --> 16:20.400
- NO, NO. UH...

16:22.800 --> 16:23.900
LISTEN, GERARD...

16:23.900 --> 16:25.100
- OH, BOY.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.100
- WHAT?

16:26.100 --> 16:27.767
- YOU'RE FIRING ME?

16:27.767 --> 16:29.533
- WHAT?

16:29.533 --> 16:31.100
- IT'S JUST
EVERY TIME IN MY LIFE

16:31.100 --> 16:32.967
SOMEONE HAS SAID,
"LISTEN, GERARD,"

16:32.967 --> 16:34.300
IT'S EITHER
I'M BEING FIRED,

16:34.300 --> 16:38.200
OR THERE'S
A MEDICAL COMPLICATION.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.233
- [laughs]

16:39.233 --> 16:42.067
YEAH, OH, OH,
NO, NO.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.867
NO, NO, I JUST WANTED
TO TALK, YOU KNOW?

16:44.867 --> 16:46.767
JUST...TALK.

16:46.767 --> 16:48.533
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

16:48.533 --> 16:52.433
OKAY, UM...

16:52.433 --> 16:55.233
I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE,
YOU KNOW,

16:55.233 --> 16:58.133
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
KIND OF GRUMPY WITH YOU.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.967
- I DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.333
- IT'S OKAY.

17:02.333 --> 17:05.400
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME

17:05.400 --> 17:08.300
THAT IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH YOURSELF,

17:08.300 --> 17:10.567
YOU SHOULD WORK
ON YOURSELF,

17:10.567 --> 17:12.533
AND I'VE BEEN KIND OF THINKING
ABOUT THAT,

17:12.533 --> 17:16.767
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD WORK ON YOU.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.833
- WHAT?

17:23.833 --> 17:25.433
- I...

17:25.433 --> 17:28.300
NO, YOU SEE, 'CAUSE
SINCE YOU'RE WORKING FOR ME,

17:28.300 --> 17:31.033
YOU ARE THEN
A REFLECTION OF ME.

17:31.033 --> 17:32.800
AND THAT IS WHY...

17:32.800 --> 17:35.867
WE SHOULD WORK ON YOU.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.567
- I DON'T KNOW. I--

17:37.567 --> 17:39.300
- NOW, SEE, SEE,
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE,

17:39.300 --> 17:40.400
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT ME.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.633
WHEN YOU TALK
TO SOMEBODY,

17:41.633 --> 17:43.333
YOU SHOULD MAKE
EYE CONTACT, YOU KNOW?

17:43.333 --> 17:45.100
JUST TRY--TRY SAYING
SOMETHING TO ME.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.400
- WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

17:46.400 --> 17:47.833
- NO, NO, YOU'RE LOOKING
AT YOUR SHOES.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.433
YOU SHOULD LOOK UP.
LOOK--MAKE EYE CONTACT.

17:50.433 --> 17:54.567
- YOU SAID I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING WEIRD.

17:56.433 --> 17:58.300
- AND ANOTHER THING:
WHY YOU ALWAYS GOT

17:58.300 --> 18:01.200
TO LOOK SO MOPEY
ALL THE TIME FOR?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.267
- THAT'S MY FACE.
I CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

18:04.267 --> 18:05.633
- WELL, HAVE YOU TRIED?

18:05.633 --> 18:07.600
YOU SHOULD JUST, LIKE,
RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS

18:07.600 --> 18:08.667
AND SMILE A LITTLE.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.800
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.900
YEAH--WELL...

18:11.900 --> 18:14.467
NOT A BIG SCARY...

18:14.467 --> 18:16.233
THAT'S--

18:16.233 --> 18:18.133
THAT'S A BIG SCARY SMILE;
JUST A LITTLE...

18:18.133 --> 18:19.600
SMILE A LITTLE BIT.
SMILE A LITTLE.

18:19.600 --> 18:24.367
NO, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE IN PAIN NOW.

18:24.367 --> 18:27.333
A SMILE, A LITTLE SMILE,
NOT A BIG SMILE.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.300
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.733
- NOBODY LIKES TO WORK
ON THEMSELVES, GERARD.

18:31.733 --> 18:33.367
YOU GOT TO STAND UP
STRAIGHT TOO.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.900
- I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO MOVE LIKE THAT.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.133
I THINK
I HAVE SCIATICA.

18:38.133 --> 18:40.367
- SEE, THAT'S ANOTHER THING.
THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

18:40.367 --> 18:42.367
WHY DO YOU GOT TO BE
SO NEGATIVE ALL THE TIME?

18:42.367 --> 18:44.667
- 'CAUSE I'M NOT
VERY HAPPY.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.867
- WELL, WHOSE FAULT IS THAT,
GERARD?

18:47.867 --> 18:49.467
- RIGHT NOW?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.133
- YOU EVEN TALK STRANGE.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.500
YOU'RE ALL NASALLY
AND WHINILY AND--

18:57.500 --> 18:59.333
LIKE, THE WORD
YOU JUST SAID.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.133
RIGHT...

19:00.133 --> 19:01.567
- "NEOW"?

19:01.567 --> 19:03.933
- OKAY, WHAT DOES
A CAT SAY?

19:03.933 --> 19:06.700
- YOU MEAN
A TALKING CAT?

19:06.700 --> 19:10.333
- NO! A REGULAR CAT!
A REGULAR CAT.

19:10.333 --> 19:13.333
WHAT DOES A REGULAR CAT SAY?
- "MEOW."

19:13.333 --> 19:15.433
- MEOW. NEOW.
MEOW. NEOW.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.467
YOU SEE THAT?
SEE HOW ANNOYING THAT CAN BE?

19:17.467 --> 19:20.867
- YEAH,
BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:20.867 --> 19:23.200
- TRY IT LIKE THIS.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.733
RIGHT NOW.

19:25.733 --> 19:28.967
- RIGHT NEOW.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.533
- TRY IT AGAIN.
RIGHT NOW.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.867
- RIGHT NEOW.

19:33.867 --> 19:35.900
- NOW.
- NEOW.

19:35.900 --> 19:36.967
- NOW.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.967
- NEOW.
- NOW.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.133
- NEOW!
- NEOW!

19:39.133 --> 19:40.667
- NEOW!
- NEOW!

19:40.667 --> 19:41.600
- NEOW!
- NEOW!

19:41.600 --> 19:43.133
- YOU SAY IT JUST
LIKE I DO.

19:43.133 --> 19:44.767
- NO, NO, I DON'T!
JUST TRY IT AGAIN!

19:44.767 --> 19:45.967
TRY IT AGAIN!
NEOW!

19:45.967 --> 19:47.133
- NEOW!
- NEOW!

19:47.133 --> 19:48.233
- NEOW.
- NEOW!

19:48.233 --> 19:49.267
- NEOW.
IT'S THE SAME!

19:49.267 --> 19:50.300
- IT ISN'T!
NEOW!

19:50.300 --> 19:51.600
- NEOW.
- NEOW!

19:51.600 --> 19:53.767
- THIS ISN'T
ABOUT ME, GERARD!

19:53.767 --> 19:55.133
- KNOCK IT OFF!

19:55.133 --> 19:57.200
YOU'RE REALLY ANNOYING!

20:04.033 --> 20:06.633
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:06.633 --> 20:07.500
I QUIT.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.733
I'VE HAD IT
WITH YOU

20:08.733 --> 20:10.500
AND YOUR WHOLE SIDE
OF THE FAMILY.

20:10.500 --> 20:15.967
I ONLY TOOK THIS JOB
BECAUSE MY MOM OWES AUNT MARIE.

20:15.967 --> 20:17.533
- MY MOM OWES YOUR MOM!

20:17.533 --> 20:19.233
- YEAH, YEAH.
BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

20:19.233 --> 20:21.733
I'M OUT OF HERE,
YOU CRAZY BASTARD!

20:24.800 --> 20:26.133
- YOU GOT PROBLEMS, PAL!

20:26.133 --> 20:28.033
YOU GOT PROBLEMS,
ALL RIGHT?

20:28.033 --> 20:29.567
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

20:29.567 --> 20:33.267
YOU'RE GONNA GO THROUGH LIFE
BLIND TO YOUR PROBLEMS!

20:33.267 --> 20:36.267
AND THERE'S NO CALL
FOR THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE!

20:40.900 --> 20:44.667
NEOW.
DAH!

20:44.667 --> 20:45.700
RIGHT NEOW.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.200
AHH!

20:51.567 --> 20:53.067
RIGHT NOW. NOW!

20:53.067 --> 20:57.233
RIGHT NOW!
RIGHT NOW!

21:04.033 --> 21:06.500
OH, GOOD.
GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.733
I'M ANNOYING? HUH?
YOU THINK I'M ANNOYING?

21:08.733 --> 21:09.867
WHERE'S MOM AND DAD?

21:09.867 --> 21:11.233
- SHOPPING.

21:11.233 --> 21:14.700
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU'RE ON PAGE THREE.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.233
I'M ANNOYING.

21:17.233 --> 21:18.500
YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN PLACE,

21:18.500 --> 21:20.133
AND YET YOU'RE ALWAYS
OVER HERE.

21:20.133 --> 21:23.767
ANNOYING.

21:23.767 --> 21:27.233
- THAT'S LOYALTY.
THAT'S A DEVOTED SON.

21:27.233 --> 21:30.233
- FINE, THAT'S YOUR SPIN
ON IT, OKAY, GOOD.

21:30.233 --> 21:31.800
YOU CAN HAVE THAT.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.400
HOW ABOUT
THE WAY YOU EAT?

21:33.400 --> 21:35.667
EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A BITE,
YOU TOUCH IT TO YOUR CHIN FIRST.

21:35.667 --> 21:36.667
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

21:36.667 --> 21:38.700
- QUIRKY.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.567
IF I WAS FAMOUS,
EVERYONE WOULD BE DOING IT.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.000
- YOUR FEET SMELL.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.233
- [laughs]
ALL RIGHT.

21:50.233 --> 21:52.033
NOW YOU'RE GRASPING.
[laughs]

21:52.033 --> 21:53.333
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

21:53.333 --> 21:54.700
HOW ABOUT THAT LAUGH
RIGHT THERE, HUH?

21:54.700 --> 21:56.300
THAT'S ANNOYING.
- AMY THINKS IT'S CUTE.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.033
- SHE'S ANNOYING TOO.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.667
I'VE MADE MY POINT!
