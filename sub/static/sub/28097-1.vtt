MAN: What's going on over
there, Lo?

01:23.516 --> 01:24.884
Alex is always staring at me.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.385
He's, like, obsessed with me.

01:26.418 --> 01:28.621
No, that's not at all what...

01:28.654 --> 01:32.592
Which is amazing, because I've
been in love with you for forever.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.461
Are you serious?
I thought you didn't know I existed.

01:35.494 --> 01:38.364
How could I not notice a guy in
our grade who has a thousand views

01:38.397 --> 01:40.633
on his last
League of Legends stream?

01:40.666 --> 01:44.871

- Alex Finn!

02:05.424 --> 02:07.260
What, what, what.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.195
It's not what it looks like.

02:09.228 --> 02:12.365
I mean, I've heard
of online dating,

02:12.398 --> 02:15.335
but this is ridonkulous.

02:17.269 --> 02:18.838
Be careful in detention, Alex.

MAN: I suggest if you

02:19.872 --> 02:21.541

Shut up, Darius.
At least he got her to look at him.

02:24.243 --> 02:26.043
Maybe I should start
making out with my phone.

everything you've learned
in the last two months

02:38.390 --> 02:40.726
into a presentation about,

02:40.759 --> 02:43.429
as the name suggests, you.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.211

Yo, what's up, players?

03:23.535 --> 03:25.605
Today, pretty nervous,
I've got a quiz.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.807
I'll report to you the details.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.010
Sounds good.
Hello Lo.

03:31.043 --> 03:32.745
Finished painting my nails.

03:32.778 --> 03:35.381
What's up, ladies?

03:38.317 --> 03:39.719
What? No.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.923
It's 7:30!
I'm gonna be late.

03:43.956 --> 03:46.692
What's the rush?

03:46.725 --> 03:48.361
School starts in a half an hour.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.962
Can't Mom and Dad take you?

03:49.995 --> 03:51.339
They're about to
leave for the airport.

03:51.363 --> 03:53.766
Oh, right, the honeymoon.

03:53.799 --> 03:57.637
Boys? Boys!

03:57.670 --> 03:59.772
Honey, they're just sleeping,
they're not stubborn.

03:59.805 --> 04:01.574
- All right,
- What is this, TMZ?

04:01.607 --> 04:03.309
Hey, Dad.

04:03.342 --> 04:05.422
You're gonna make us take
our luggage down ourselves?

04:07.079 --> 04:09.282
Come on, boys, Lyft's waiting.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.685
All right, call my cell
phone only in emergencies.

04:12.718 --> 04:14.587
It's two dollars a minute.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.755
And be sure you turn all
the lights off in the house,

04:16.789 --> 04:18.733
otherwise you'll be paying the
utility bill with your allowance.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.293
Yeah, roger that.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.795
And I want to see pictures.

04:22.828 --> 04:24.330
Of us just sitting
around the house?

04:24.363 --> 04:27.700
No, I just like
to see your faces.

04:27.733 --> 04:29.435
Oh, sweetheart.

04:29.468 --> 04:30.836
I'm gonna miss you so much.

04:30.869 --> 04:33.005
And you're gonna be tall
by the time I get back.

04:33.038 --> 04:34.674
Probably.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.509
And remember to pick up
your bother today

04:36.542 --> 04:38.611
after school,
5:30 p.m. sharp.

04:38.644 --> 04:39.879
- 5:30.
- 5:30.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.814
And don't forget to feed Milton.

04:41.847 --> 04:43.316
I'll remind him.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.818
All right, I'm giving
you $200 for food.

04:45.851 --> 04:47.820
Don't blow it all
on steak chips and gelato.

04:47.853 --> 04:50.790
You'll be eating dirt
for the rest of the week.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.726
Where you going, Arthur?

04:53.759 --> 04:56.829
Just pretend you can't hear him.

04:56.862 --> 05:00.533
- Be careful with this.
- Um, are you serious?

05:00.566 --> 05:03.336
He's gonna blow it all on
in-app purchases and zit cream.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.338
Uh, you try beating Candy Crush

05:05.371 --> 05:07.039
without the golden
pineapple, mister.

05:07.072 --> 05:12.011
EJ, I'm trusting you, all right?

05:12.044 --> 05:14.881
Just don't be yourself.

05:16.415 --> 05:17.850
You got it, Dad.

05:17.883 --> 05:19.852
They play Nintendo too loud!

05:19.885 --> 05:22.021
Tell them I won't tolerate that.

05:22.054 --> 05:25.458
- What's that, Bernie?
- Where are you going?

05:25.491 --> 05:28.394
Maureen and I are
headed for the Bahamas

05:28.427 --> 05:29.962
- for our anniversary.
- Hi, Bernie.

05:29.995 --> 05:32.765
Who's watching the youngsters?

05:32.798 --> 05:34.967
They're 17 and 24.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.669
They're perfectly
capable of taking...

05:36.702 --> 05:38.371
I don't trust the small one.

05:38.404 --> 05:41.874
Thank you, Mr. Delaney.
Awesome.

05:41.907 --> 05:43.776
All right, boys,
no horsing around.

05:43.809 --> 05:46.045
And you know what?
Turn off those machines

05:46.078 --> 05:48.414
every once in
a while and go outside.

05:48.447 --> 05:50.058
There's a whole world out
there that you're missing, huh?

05:50.082 --> 05:52.051
- I agree.
- Yeah, okay.

05:52.084 --> 05:53.686
Bernie, you're
watering your shoes.

05:53.719 --> 05:58.157
Gosh dang it.

05:58.190 --> 06:01.594
- Bye. We'll miss you!
- Bye. Bye.

06:01.627 --> 06:04.063
Maybe.

06:04.096 --> 06:05.998
Woo! No parents.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.639
Come on, man,
don't spit in my face

06:13.672 --> 06:14.774
and tell me it's raining,

06:14.807 --> 06:16.909
You're my go-to guy, brother.

06:16.942 --> 06:18.911
I gotta say, man,
I don't like what I'm hearing.

06:18.944 --> 06:20.913
EJ, what's the status
on the sushi?

06:20.946 --> 06:22.681
The meeting's about to start.

06:22.714 --> 06:24.459
I'm on the phone with
the delivery guy right now.

06:24.483 --> 06:26.919
- Should be here any minute.
- Bring it in right away.

06:26.952 --> 06:29.522
And please button your shirt.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.857
You look like a child.

MAN ON SPEAKER:
<i>Who hears that?</i>

06:53.979 --> 06:55.890
Yeah, we're not hearing
anything on this end, Owen.

06:55.914 --> 06:57.783
<i>Exactly.
That's the sound of Gray Pop</i>

07:01.753 --> 07:03.832

07:03.856 --> 07:06.592
Actually, sir, I do have...

07:06.625 --> 07:08.961
Sorry. So I take it you weren't
impressed with the ideas

07:08.994 --> 07:10.038
that I sent over to you, boss?

07:10.062 --> 07:11.730
<i>I actually was impressed</i>

07:11.763 --> 07:14.133
<i>by how astonishingly
off the mark you were.</i>

07:14.166 --> 07:15.968
<i>You're thinking inside
the box, people.</i>

07:16.001 --> 07:17.970

Shut up! Jesus!

07:25.010 --> 07:26.688
<i>- What's that, gentlemen?</i>
- No. No, no, no.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.156
I'm sorry. Sorry, boss.
Not talking to you.

07:28.180 --> 07:29.982
I was talking to
the receptionist.

07:30.015 --> 07:32.251
He keeps coming in and out
of the conference room.

07:32.284 --> 07:33.962
- I'm very sorry.
<i>- The reception's fine on my end.</i>

07:33.986 --> 07:35.788

07:35.821 --> 07:37.165

It's data science.</i>

07:37.189 --> 07:38.724
Yeah, of course.

07:38.757 --> 07:40.068
Yeah, I know the difference
between data...

- Okay, great.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.863
Hung up. Good job, guys.

07:43.896 --> 07:44.897
Smooth move, Jonathan.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.098
Shut up.

MAN: <i> Broadcasting from

<i>What's up, fam?</i>

07:54.306 --> 07:57.009
I got my hair on point,
know what I'm saying?

07:57.042 --> 07:58.911
This is Eskin Radio...

07:58.944 --> 08:02.014
There's no way that's
Mr. Eskin's real hair.

08:02.047 --> 08:03.558
Do you think he got
plugs or something?

08:03.582 --> 08:05.017
They can turn the scalp around.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.519
It has to be extensions.

08:06.552 --> 08:09.255
ESKIN: Hey, shh!
I'm trying to podcast.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.491
Okay. Nice hair.

08:13.258 --> 08:15.127
Does anyone here
know how to paste

08:15.160 --> 08:16.896
an Instagram photo
into a document?

08:16.929 --> 08:20.099
Yes, yes! I mean, yes.
I know how. I know how.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.200
I'm Alex, by the way.

08:21.233 --> 08:22.735
I know who you are, Alex.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.045
We've had, like,
10 classes together.

08:24.069 --> 08:26.038
Actually,
13 if you count P.E.

08:26.071 --> 08:27.573
Or is it 12?

08:27.606 --> 08:30.042
Anyway, ballpark figure.
Anyway.

08:30.075 --> 08:33.178
Instagram.
Okay, let's see here.

08:33.211 --> 08:34.914
Whoa! No.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.650
You have 72.4
thousand followers?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.219
Shh, that's my other account.
I'm really into nail art,

08:40.251 --> 08:41.787
so I made an Instagram about it.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.923
Miley tweeted about it once
and it kinda blew up.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.758
Why do you keep it a secret?

08:45.791 --> 08:47.593
Well, it's not a secret exactly,

08:47.626 --> 08:48.636
it's just when people find out,
they treat you differently.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.796
It's gross, actually.

08:50.829 --> 08:52.231
But it's a big part of my life,

08:52.264 --> 08:54.967
so I thought I would put
it in the presentation.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.736
That's so cool.
If I had a fanbase like that...

08:57.769 --> 09:00.673
- There he goes!
- He's doing it.

09:03.275 --> 09:05.844
Oh, uh, embedding.
Yes, of course.

09:05.877 --> 09:07.021
See these three dots right here?

09:07.045 --> 09:08.747
Okay, so what we're gonna do

09:08.780 --> 09:10.191
is we're gonna click
those three dots, boom,

09:10.215 --> 09:14.086
and we're gonna copy,
boom, paste, voila!

09:14.119 --> 09:15.955
Whoa, you are really
good at that.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.891
Looks like I'm not the only
one with a hidden talent.

09:18.924 --> 09:20.793
Yeah, I don't like
to brag or anything.

09:20.826 --> 09:23.362
It's just more of like
it's a thing, like I...

09:23.395 --> 09:25.331
- Oh, my God.
- I'm all right. I'm fine.

09:25.364 --> 09:26.332
I'm fine.
I didn't break anything.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.333
I'm good. I'm good.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.635
- Okay.
- Thank you.

09:29.668 --> 09:30.870
Talk to you later.
Okay.

09:37.809 --> 09:42.748
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,
Ellie, Ellie.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.985
What's going on?

09:46.018 --> 09:47.658
What are you doing
in my office, Jonathan?

09:47.686 --> 09:48.988
I thought I'd just stop by

09:49.021 --> 09:50.131
and see what you've
done with the place.

09:50.155 --> 09:51.991
I really, really like it.

09:52.024 --> 09:56.295
Especially that bookshelf.
That's nice.

09:56.328 --> 09:58.297
That's great.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.299
Can I help you with something?

10:00.332 --> 10:03.002
No, I just...
I wanted to jump in here

10:03.035 --> 10:06.672
and let you know I wouldn't
worry about what Owen said.

10:06.705 --> 10:10.142
Personally, I think you're
doing a bang-up job, so...

10:10.175 --> 10:12.144
What are you even talking about?

10:12.177 --> 10:14.680
You know, about how
you haven't brought in

10:14.713 --> 10:16.324
any worthwhile companies,
and how you've been

10:16.348 --> 10:17.925
pretty much useless during
the innovation challenge.

10:17.949 --> 10:21.020
You didn't hear him
say any of that?

10:21.053 --> 10:22.821
No, I didn't.

10:22.854 --> 10:26.191
Yeah, like I said,
I wouldn't stress it.

10:26.224 --> 10:28.160
And, honestly,
if all else fails,

10:28.193 --> 10:30.796
I'm sure there will be a
receptionist job opening up soon.

10:32.064 --> 10:33.966
Yeah, that's a window.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.710
I'd put some stickers
on there or something.

10:35.734 --> 10:37.178
It's a little misleading,
and dangerous, honestly.

10:37.202 --> 10:39.105
- Get out.
- Mm-hmm.

11:02.227 --> 11:03.929
Ellie, hey.

11:03.962 --> 11:05.297
Let me get that for you.

11:05.330 --> 11:07.366
- What do you want?
- To congratulate you.

11:07.399 --> 11:08.734
On what? EJ!

11:08.767 --> 11:10.736
- Oh, my God!
- I'm so sorry.

11:10.769 --> 11:12.738
Hang on.
Hang on. I got it.

11:12.771 --> 11:14.011
I'm about to show you something

11:14.039 --> 11:15.474
that's gonna change your life.

11:15.507 --> 11:17.385
I don't have time for more
YouTube fail compilations.

11:17.409 --> 11:18.377
I have a meeting
that I have to go to.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.878
No, no, this is serious!

11:19.911 --> 11:22.081
Okay, so...

11:22.114 --> 11:24.750
I saw you talking about
that GE whatchamacallit

11:24.783 --> 11:26.427
challenge about the app,
but it just so happens

11:26.451 --> 11:28.787
that this folder, while
appearing to be your

11:28.820 --> 11:30.889
run of the mill
sopping wet folder,

11:30.922 --> 11:34.093
actually contains several
billion dollar ideas.

11:34.126 --> 11:35.761
And the best part?

11:35.794 --> 11:37.930
I am giving you the first look.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.799
Oh, come on! This thing has
your name written all over it.

11:40.832 --> 11:45.204
Actually, EJ, my name
is written with two Ls.

11:45.237 --> 11:48.407
You don't even know the
parameters of the challenge.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.477
This is not just any random app.
We need an app...

11:51.510 --> 11:54.113
That leverages GE's
Predix cloud software

11:54.146 --> 11:56.115
to lessen our carbon
footprint while enhancing

11:56.148 --> 11:58.083
everyday life through
insights and solutions

11:58.116 --> 12:00.252
that leverage real-time data.

12:00.285 --> 12:03.956
Yeah, I read the
all-company emails, too.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.433
Granted I had to Google
most of those words,

12:05.457 --> 12:08.127
but I am 90% certain
that there is a unicorn

12:08.160 --> 12:10.029
hiding inside these pages.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.278
You just made the best
decision of your career.

12:17.302 --> 12:18.738
Debatable!

12:20.872 --> 12:22.307
I have to say, my camera roll

12:22.340 --> 12:24.309
from this past year
was on fleek.

12:24.342 --> 12:27.813
I mean, me and my sister
on stage at Comic-Con?

12:27.846 --> 12:30.282
And our family trip
to Harry Potter World?

12:30.315 --> 12:33.285
- Expelliarmus!
- Hey, were you bummed

12:33.318 --> 12:35.154
when the sorting hat
put you in Hufflepuff?

12:35.187 --> 12:37.289
Okay, how are you guys
not stressed out about this?

12:37.322 --> 12:38.791
What?

12:38.824 --> 12:40.464
We can bang this project
out in our sleep.

12:40.492 --> 12:42.294
I'm not talking about
the technical aspect.

12:42.327 --> 12:44.963
Photos and videos that
communicate who I am?

12:44.996 --> 12:46.398
What am I supposed
to show, this?

12:46.431 --> 12:50.035
Oh, but you love Pow Pow.

12:50.068 --> 12:52.471
Yeah. Or this?

12:52.504 --> 12:55.174
- That's crushing it, though.
- Yeah.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.309
- What about this?
- A-plus.

12:57.342 --> 12:58.510
I am not laughing, okay?

12:58.543 --> 13:00.780
I could humiliate
myself in front of Lo.

13:03.348 --> 13:06.051
Relax, her best
friend is Lamey Jamie.

13:08.553 --> 13:11.490
Hey, hey, Jamie
is not that lamey.

13:11.523 --> 13:14.193
Okay, and as I was saying,

13:14.226 --> 13:16.328
maybe she has a secret
attraction to ninja coders

13:16.361 --> 13:18.497
who rocked braces
for nine years.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.199
- Thanks, Darius.
- Yeah.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.201
Don't worry, there are
people in this school

13:22.234 --> 13:24.169
way more suss than we are.

13:24.202 --> 13:27.873
DARIUS: Yeah, like,
uh, like the math nerds.

13:27.906 --> 13:31.343
How about the foreign
exchange kids?

13:31.376 --> 13:34.346
And the drama geeks.

13:34.379 --> 13:37.216
Okay, okay, I get it,
but you're missing the point.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.219
All of those cliques
have a thing.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.486
They're all unique.

13:41.519 --> 13:44.356
I'm just some kid.

13:44.389 --> 13:46.024
Not everybody's a thing.

13:46.057 --> 13:48.060
Look at Bernie Davis.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.062
Nah, he's on
the basketball team.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.164
Um, Spencer Boyle.

13:52.197 --> 13:54.900
He's super into Jesus.

13:54.933 --> 13:57.069
- Ariel Green.
- Oh, she talks loud.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.038
Hey, Tara!
Save me a seat!

14:00.071 --> 14:01.540
Oh, yeah.

14:01.573 --> 14:04.543
Oh, I've got one.
Cole Winnard.

14:04.576 --> 14:06.912
And then she said,
"Are you just happy to see me

14:06.945 --> 14:08.022
or is that your phone
in your pocket?"

14:08.046 --> 14:09.381
I didn't have my phone!

14:09.414 --> 14:11.250
I mean, he doesn't have a thing,

14:11.283 --> 14:13.060
and considering the fact
that he's friends with Lo,

14:13.084 --> 14:15.254
I mean, he's doing
pretty good for himself.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.256
Mmm, he throws parties.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.925
See ya!
Have a good trip!

14:19.958 --> 14:21.327
Woo-hoo-hoo.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.632
- Dude, there's your answer.
- What?

14:26.665 --> 14:28.200
Throw your own party.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.944
Aren't your parents out
of town this weekend?

14:29.968 --> 14:32.304
Okay, there's a lot of legal
risks associated with...

14:32.337 --> 14:34.106
Don't ruin this one for us.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.575
Look, the guy who throws
the party gets the girl.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.277
That means we do, too.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.578
Ain't happening.

14:39.611 --> 14:42.014
A, our guild practice
is this weekend.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.491
B, I have no idea
how to throw a party.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.218
Can we forget about
the stupid guild for once?

14:46.251 --> 14:49.288
How dare you speak ill
of the Crusaders of Xenith?

14:49.321 --> 14:52.124
We've played thousands
of hours of Warcraft,

14:52.157 --> 14:53.592
and what do we have
to show for it?

14:53.625 --> 14:55.160
A high ranking
and literally the love

14:55.193 --> 14:57.129
of thousands of Ukrainians.

14:57.162 --> 15:00.065
I'd rather have the love
of a few IRL for once,

15:00.098 --> 15:02.301
and you should, too.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.702
What if nobody shows up

15:03.735 --> 15:05.304
and I'm the laughingstock
of the school?

15:05.337 --> 15:07.339
Dude, are you seriously
considering this?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.576

Was that even real?

15:30.362 --> 15:32.464
Please don't sneak up
on me like that.

15:32.497 --> 15:35.334
Ah! Yes.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.170
So I see you have
perused the X-Files.

15:38.203 --> 15:41.473
I have, and most of these
ideas are absolutely terrible.

15:41.506 --> 15:43.342
Hey, hey, look, Ellie.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.177
Facebook wasn't built in a day.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.645
Actually, it was.

15:46.678 --> 15:48.480
- It was?
- It was.

15:48.513 --> 15:51.383
I mean, come on, EJ.

15:51.416 --> 15:53.018
Look at some of these ideas.

15:53.051 --> 15:55.487
An app that monitors
how much gas you pass

15:55.520 --> 15:57.365
when you eat certain foods
so that you can track

15:57.389 --> 15:59.491
your carbon emissions
and improve your diet?

15:59.524 --> 16:01.293
Yeah, I stand by
Outsmart Your Fart.

16:01.326 --> 16:03.362
Lyft for couch potatoes?

16:03.395 --> 16:05.506
Sometimes the remote gets stuck
on the other side of the room

16:05.530 --> 16:07.199
and you gotta
get somebody to go get it.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.668
I guess there's
really only one in here

16:09.701 --> 16:11.536
that actually kind of works.

16:11.569 --> 16:13.205
Really, there is?

16:13.238 --> 16:14.715
Monitoring your device usage
to save time and energy.

16:14.739 --> 16:17.042
Ah, yes, okay.

16:17.075 --> 16:19.044
So that little gem
came to me when my dad

16:19.077 --> 16:21.389
started yelling at me for spending
all my free time on my cell phone.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.682
And I thought to myself,
what if I could develop an app

16:23.715 --> 16:25.784
that would encourage
you to go offline

16:25.817 --> 16:28.053
but then also
conserve electricity?

16:28.086 --> 16:31.457
So, do you have a prototype
for this earth-shattering idea?

16:34.092 --> 16:36.495
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?

16:36.528 --> 16:40.499
Yeah, it's, um, right...
This guy right here.

16:40.532 --> 16:43.201
No, EJ, I meant a minimum
viable product, okay?

16:43.234 --> 16:45.404
A working version of the app.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.239
Yes, I totally have that, too.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.707
The only thing
is that my developer

16:48.740 --> 16:50.342
is working on fixing
some bugs right now

16:50.375 --> 16:52.711
and I can't deliver anything
less than perfection.

16:52.744 --> 16:54.413
Okay.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.482
Thursday morning then,
before the staff meeting.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.087
Thursday, yeah.
Okay, great.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.489
Thursday it is.

17:14.265 --> 17:15.733
It's not your fault.

17:15.767 --> 17:18.270
EJ was supposed to pick me up.

- Welcome home.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.884
Aah! What is wrong with you?

18:05.917 --> 18:07.886
Were you seriously
just sitting in the dark

18:07.919 --> 18:10.122
waiting for me to
come home, you freak?

18:10.155 --> 18:11.435
Aren't you forgetting something?

18:14.192 --> 18:16.261
Is it national sibling day?

18:16.294 --> 18:18.697
You were supposed to pick me
up from school, you jerk.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.166
Ah, that explains it.

18:21.199 --> 18:24.636
I wrote down "pick up Alex"
on my hand, but it smudged,

18:24.669 --> 18:26.538
So I thought it said
"pick up a lox."

18:26.571 --> 18:30.175
I bought all this
lox for nothing.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.344
You are literally
too dumb to get mad at.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.646
No, no, no, wait.
Dude, no, don't go.

18:34.679 --> 18:36.448
I need your help
with something, okay?

18:36.481 --> 18:38.359
It's for work, and I promise,
I can't pay you right now,

18:38.383 --> 18:40.819
but shares of my future company
could literally be worth

18:40.852 --> 18:42.821
billions of dollars.

18:42.854 --> 18:44.523
Trillions of dollars,
dude, come on!

18:44.556 --> 18:46.458
- Nope, not helping.
- Please?

18:52.397 --> 18:54.600
I guess it's just
you and me, lox.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.677
I still think this
is a terrible idea,

19:05.710 --> 19:08.346
but if we're gonna do it,
we should do it right.

19:08.379 --> 19:11.950
So, I ran a Twitter search
for the hashtag "sickparty",

19:11.983 --> 19:14.553
then aggregated the results,

19:14.586 --> 19:18.390
and what I noticed were that ping
pong balls were featured a lot.

19:18.423 --> 19:20.625
So we're definitely gonna
want ping pong balls.

19:20.658 --> 19:22.561
- I love ping pong.
- Me as well.

19:22.594 --> 19:25.664
No, no, no, we do not have
time to crunch numbers.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.699
Let's just think about
all the rad parties

19:27.732 --> 19:29.668
we've been to in the past.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.576
Oh, my cousin Allegra had
a piñata at her quinceañera.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.778
Now we're getting somewhere.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.714
Piñatas are a bop.
Do you guys not watch CW?

19:42.747 --> 19:45.250
It's all about foam parties.

19:45.283 --> 19:47.686
Look in that book.
I guarantee you it's somewhere in there.

19:47.719 --> 19:50.689
Look at it.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.691
Oh, that looks unhygienic.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.593
How about glow in the dark?

19:54.626 --> 19:57.362
We whiten our teeth
and we get an advantage

19:57.395 --> 19:59.331
over all of the other guys.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.574
I can't believe
I'm friends with you.

20:00.598 --> 20:03.368
Okay, Stu, search Yelp
for party planners.

20:03.401 --> 20:05.437
I'll put an ad on Craigslist.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.906
Darius, keep an eye
on Lo's Snapchat.

20:07.939 --> 20:09.975
All right.

20:30.928 --> 20:33.598
Is it on? The camera? Oh!

20:33.631 --> 20:36.768
Hola. Hi, how are
you gringos locos?

20:36.801 --> 20:38.803
So I've seen that
you've posted online

20:38.836 --> 20:40.739
that you need help
for this fiesta, right?

20:40.772 --> 20:43.475
What's up, guys?
It's Barry the beat-boxer.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.310
Heard you need a little
"eh-wuh-eh-wuh"

20:45.343 --> 20:46.387
entertainment for your party.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.946
And if that is the case,

20:47.979 --> 20:50.649
then you go no other place

20:50.682 --> 20:52.451
than Kudro the Cowboy.

20:55.987 --> 20:57.789
Hello there.
I'm Rickets.

20:57.822 --> 21:00.325
Like crickets,
but without the "K".

21:00.358 --> 21:01.660
I'm a software developer.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.329
I made a game
called Duck Hunter.

21:04.362 --> 21:05.673
Apparently there
was already a game

21:05.697 --> 21:06.665
called Duck Hunter out there.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.633
I was not aware of this.

21:08.666 --> 21:11.569
Although we are not technically
conjoined, we act as though we are.

21:11.602 --> 21:13.672
You can reach me
on my Facebook page,

21:13.705 --> 21:17.042
or I got a SoundCloud
because I'm also a singer.

21:17.075 --> 21:18.977
♪ You were the first ♪

21:19.010 --> 21:20.912
♪ So was I ♪

21:20.945 --> 21:23.815
(BEAT-BOXING)

21:23.848 --> 21:25.517
(COUGHS)

21:25.550 --> 21:26.985
Hey, it's me!
Reddy the Clown.

21:27.018 --> 21:28.687
Hire me for your party.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.755
Hire me! Please!
I need the work!

21:30.788 --> 21:32.524
I'm just kidding... but I'm not.

21:32.557 --> 21:33.992
I got lots of special skills.

21:34.025 --> 21:35.994
I can dance,
I can do balloon animals,

21:36.027 --> 21:39.531
I'm good with kids,
archery, hiking.

21:39.564 --> 21:40.841
I used to be a barista.
I don't know.

21:40.865 --> 21:44.536
I come with all
sorts of fun stuff.

21:44.569 --> 21:48.473
I, Lady Maybelline,
can make your party lit.

21:48.506 --> 21:50.542
- I'll bring yogurt.
- Broken legs.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.812
I even have
this pretty sweet thing.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.413
(COUGHS)

21:55.446 --> 21:57.649
It's make me cough
when I go too hard.

21:57.682 --> 21:58.950
Anyway, hire me.

21:58.983 --> 22:02.554
Go no place else
than Kudro the Cowboy.

22:02.587 --> 22:03.922
- Call us.
- Call us.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.090
I'm coming.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.792
Hit me up, Reddy the Clown.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.563
And 200.
Now, you're sure

22:11.596 --> 22:13.398
you can get this
out by Thursday?

22:13.431 --> 22:16.868
Yeah. Don't be
so paranoid, man.

22:16.901 --> 22:19.037
- You're in great hands.
- That's fantastic.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.381
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little nervous

22:20.405 --> 22:21.673
about giving that much money

22:21.706 --> 22:23.875
to someone I never met
on the internet.

22:23.908 --> 22:25.811
Aah!

22:27.078 --> 22:29.348
Aah!

22:31.616 --> 22:33.952
Why?

22:33.985 --> 22:37.422
Dude, we could ask
Cole Winnard for help.

22:37.455 --> 22:39.591
He's not gonna help us.

22:39.624 --> 22:42.060
That's like Kylo Ren
helping Jar Jar Binks.

22:42.093 --> 22:44.996
That's like Taylor Swift
helping Hannah Montana.

22:46.631 --> 22:47.632
- Whoa.
- Oh.

22:47.665 --> 22:49.067
What happened with you?

22:49.100 --> 22:50.135
Craigslist.

22:51.702 --> 22:53.071
Why do you look all depressed?

22:53.104 --> 22:55.907
- ALL: Craigslist.
- For what, Pokémon cards?

22:55.940 --> 22:58.977
If you must know,
we're throwing a party on Friday night.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.879
You mean, like a Mario party?

23:00.912 --> 23:02.614
No, no, no, like a real party.

23:02.647 --> 23:06.785
Cool kids, lit music,
glow in the dark, baby.

23:06.818 --> 23:09.921
L.O.L.! Big-time L.O.L.!

23:09.954 --> 23:12.023
- You guys can't throw a party.
- Watch us.

23:12.056 --> 23:14.793
No, I'm not saying you don't
know how to throw a party,

23:14.826 --> 23:17.462
though you don't know
how to throw a party.

23:17.495 --> 23:19.464
I'm saying that dad will
freak if he finds out

23:19.497 --> 23:21.008
and I'm not putting
my butt on the line.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.935
Dude!

23:23.968 --> 23:25.036
ALL: Dude!

23:25.069 --> 23:26.805
Oh, come on, I'll do anything.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.473
I'll cook dinner
for the next week.

23:28.506 --> 23:30.475
Shh!

23:30.508 --> 23:32.510
Hold on, it's coming.

23:32.543 --> 23:35.113
Wait, wait. Shh!

23:35.146 --> 23:36.815
Yep, I got it.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.483
Light bulb moment!

23:38.516 --> 23:40.485
What are you talking about?

23:40.518 --> 23:41.662
You know that app you
didn't want to hear about?

23:41.686 --> 23:42.821
I need it built, fast.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.122
You guys build me a prototype,

23:44.155 --> 23:45.499
I'll let you throw
your dumb party.

23:45.523 --> 23:47.125
What's the app?

23:47.158 --> 23:48.635
Basically we use
GE's cloud technology

23:48.659 --> 23:50.028
to monitor
the town's power grid.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.130
When demand surges,
everybody's devices turn off

23:52.163 --> 23:53.965
except for emergency calls
and Taco Bell.

23:53.998 --> 23:56.134
We all conserve energy
and you guys have to go out

23:56.167 --> 23:57.845
and do stuff that doesn't
involve being on your iPads

23:57.869 --> 23:59.671
and Xboxes and what have you.

23:59.704 --> 24:01.673
Have some decency, man.

24:01.706 --> 24:03.984
Okay, I am not interested in
the peanut gallery right now.

24:04.008 --> 24:04.976
Can you build it or not?

24:05.009 --> 24:07.145
When do you need it by?

24:07.178 --> 24:08.480
Thursday morning.

24:08.513 --> 24:10.849
- Thursday?
- It's doable.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.860
I mean, I'm down,
but we need to set up for the party.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.161
Don't worry about that.
I got a guy.

24:14.185 --> 24:15.620
- A guy?
- A guy.

24:16.554 --> 24:18.523
Get in here.

24:18.556 --> 24:21.460
(WHISPERING)

24:24.896 --> 24:26.164
We need to spit up the server,

24:26.197 --> 24:27.866
then write the JavaScript,

24:27.899 --> 24:29.868
then Darius and Stu can
handle it from there.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.011
Okay, so what does that mean?

24:31.035 --> 24:32.537
We accept your offer.

24:32.570 --> 24:35.707
Woo! Come here.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.551
You know what? No, forget it.
Just get in the car.

24:37.575 --> 24:38.910
- Get in the car.
- See you, guys.

24:38.943 --> 24:40.712
- See you, Alex.
- Come on, let's go.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.814
- Later, nerds.
- Bye, EJ.

25:01.599 --> 25:03.735
- Is it good yet?
- What?

25:03.768 --> 25:04.936
The app, is it good?

25:04.969 --> 25:06.289
It's literally
been three minutes.

25:17.348 --> 25:19.851
- Are you?
- Nine.

25:21.719 --> 25:22.921
Come sit with me.

25:24.088 --> 25:25.724
Over there.

25:28.893 --> 25:29.893
You go first.

25:31.262 --> 25:33.265
Okay.

25:39.670 --> 25:40.638
So you're EJ's little brother.

25:40.671 --> 25:41.973
Yeah.

25:42.006 --> 25:44.943
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?

25:44.976 --> 25:47.612
- No, sir.
- You wouldn't lie to me?

25:47.645 --> 25:49.247
I would not.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.882
So why don't you look like that?

25:55.987 --> 25:58.957
Okay, the timer
is locked and loaded,

25:58.990 --> 26:02.627
the CSS looks sharp,
and the AJAX is all set.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.962
How's the firewall tracking?

26:03.995 --> 26:05.797
Oh, it's all the way live.

26:07.965 --> 26:10.569
Mother, I don't want
to practice the piano!

26:13.838 --> 26:15.707
Is someone at the door?

26:22.113 --> 26:23.757
You want to do something
different, you know?

26:23.781 --> 26:25.292
Something they're
gonna remember forever.

26:25.316 --> 26:27.752
Everybody's tweeting.
Nobody's doing this.

26:27.785 --> 26:31.122
Oh, my gosh, that's insane!

26:31.155 --> 26:33.291
What is your problem?
I just want people

26:33.324 --> 26:34.292
from my high school to show up,

26:34.325 --> 26:35.793
not random strangers.

26:35.826 --> 26:37.929
You're in high school?

26:39.163 --> 26:41.666
Huh.

26:41.699 --> 26:43.001
I mean, I guess
it's pretty cool.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.604
- How'd you do it?
- I know a guy.

26:47.104 --> 26:49.173
So, the GE cloud notifies us

26:49.206 --> 26:51.109
when the town
is using too much energy,

26:51.142 --> 26:53.845
and then every device
gets a two-minute warning.

26:53.878 --> 26:59.384
Then for three hours,
we're all stuck in real life.

26:59.417 --> 27:02.353
- Huh.
- Not bad, huh?

27:02.386 --> 27:05.256
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

27:05.289 --> 27:06.691
Oh, my God.

27:06.724 --> 27:08.126
We'll text you the Cliff Notes.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.728
It's right here. How?

27:10.761 --> 27:12.998
It's EJ, bro.

27:15.299 --> 27:18.102
Weather forecasts,
grid maintenance,

27:18.135 --> 27:21.272
scheduling and outages,
all processed in real-time

27:21.305 --> 27:23.441
through Predix, to our users

27:23.474 --> 27:28.446
because life is much better
lived than watched.

27:28.479 --> 27:29.781
Nice.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.449
That's it.

27:31.482 --> 27:33.118
You may applaud now.

27:35.486 --> 27:37.055
Calm down.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.790
OWEN: <i> Do you have
a technical cofounder?</i>

27:38.823 --> 27:42.293
Yes. Yes, we do.
It's this buddy of mine.

27:42.326 --> 27:45.296
He dropped out of Stanford,
total rock star.

27:45.329 --> 27:47.432
This guy's still at Google

27:47.465 --> 27:48.975
but he wants to come on
full-time once we raise money.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.935
- Money.
- Enough.

27:50.968 --> 27:52.103
<i>And what do you call it?</i>

27:52.136 --> 27:55.306
- Excuse me?
- The app, genius.

27:55.339 --> 27:57.475
- What's the name of the app?
- Right. Yes, okay.

27:57.508 --> 28:03.981
We're calling it
the Cloud Maximizer 2.0.

28:04.014 --> 28:05.983
Cloud Maximus 2.0.

28:06.016 --> 28:07.719
That's not even
what he said. Shut up.

28:07.752 --> 28:09.153
These things take time.

28:09.186 --> 28:11.089
<i>Based on what
I'm hearing so far...</i>

28:11.122 --> 28:12.824
Where's the market value fit?

28:12.857 --> 28:14.992
I mean, how many kids are
voluntarily gonna use this?

28:15.025 --> 28:16.494
<i>That's a fair point, Jonathan.</i>

28:16.527 --> 28:18.171
- Well, we haven't really.
- Right, you know what?

28:18.195 --> 28:20.498
Owen, you are asking
all the right questions.

28:20.531 --> 28:22.333
Is it okay if I call you Owen?

28:22.366 --> 28:25.336
- <i>Sure.</i>
- Fantastic.

28:25.369 --> 28:27.305
It just so happens that
actually we're throwing

28:27.338 --> 28:29.173
the world's first
unplugged party

28:29.206 --> 28:33.010
where all devices
will be voluntarily

28:33.043 --> 28:35.012
powered down for three hours.

28:35.045 --> 28:36.414
Genius. That's genius.

28:36.447 --> 28:37.415
Some people are
already calling it

28:37.448 --> 28:38.850
the party of the decade.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.185
You wanna swing by?

28:41.218 --> 28:42.754
Witness history in the making?

28:44.822 --> 28:46.858
There will be live music.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.527
- Kids love live music.
- Do they?

28:49.560 --> 28:51.963
<i>Well, this is the closet thing
I've seen to a good idea</i>

28:51.996 --> 28:53.364
<i>and GE's deadline
is this weekend,</i>

28:53.397 --> 28:56.033
<i>so you got your shot.</i>

28:56.066 --> 28:57.435
<i>Jonathan and I are having dinner</i>

28:57.468 --> 28:59.203
<i>with a journalist
from Tech Crunch.</i>

28:59.236 --> 29:01.038
<i>Why don't you and Ellie join,</i>

29:01.071 --> 29:02.315
<i>and then we'll
head over together?</i>

29:02.339 --> 29:03.541
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir,

29:03.574 --> 29:06.477
but what about that
vegan delivery concept

29:06.510 --> 29:08.246
that we had been talking about?

29:08.279 --> 29:10.381
<i>I've seen 12 competitors
already this week.</i>

29:10.414 --> 29:12.950
Owen, it is brilliant decisions
like this

29:12.983 --> 29:14.227
- that demonstrate why...
- <i>You may leave now.</i>

29:14.251 --> 29:15.953
Yep. 'Kay, on my way.

29:15.986 --> 29:18.389
Good? Right, guys?

29:18.422 --> 29:19.891
Cloud Maximizer 2.0.

29:19.924 --> 29:20.924
Shut up.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.897
That sounds lit.
An underground disaster party?

29:25.930 --> 29:29.233
This could do irreparable
damage to our social status.

29:29.266 --> 29:32.570
You do irreparable damage
to our social status everyday.

29:32.603 --> 29:36.574
Oh, hi. Hey.
Hello, Lo, Jamie.

29:36.607 --> 29:38.910
- Hey.
- How are you guys doing?

29:38.943 --> 29:40.244
I have to get to calculus.

29:40.277 --> 29:42.914
Hey, so do we.
You wanna come with?

29:42.947 --> 29:46.584
Um, sure.

29:46.617 --> 29:49.086
Uh, were you eating lunch?

29:49.119 --> 29:51.422
No, I just like to carry
around an empty tray.

29:51.455 --> 29:52.933
I'm actually an alien
who doesn't eat,

29:52.957 --> 29:55.092
but don't tell anyone.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.828
Stupid question.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.863
How's the project coming along?

29:58.896 --> 30:00.040
I don't know.
It's kind of hard

30:00.064 --> 30:01.441
to sum myself up
in one presentation.

30:01.465 --> 30:02.843
Kind of stressing out
about it actually.

30:02.867 --> 30:07.104
Same. Yeah.
I mean, kind of, but...

30:07.137 --> 30:09.841
I'm having a house party
tomorrow night,

30:09.874 --> 30:11.342
- if you want to join.
- Really?

30:11.375 --> 30:12.519
Didn't take you
for the house party

30:12.543 --> 30:13.978
throwing type of guy.

30:14.011 --> 30:15.379
Well, the parents
are out of town,

30:15.412 --> 30:16.990
so I thought it'd be cool
to betray their trust.

30:17.014 --> 30:18.182
Can I bring Jamie?

30:18.215 --> 30:20.318
Yeah, absolutely.

30:20.351 --> 30:23.487
You know, friends,
acquaintances,

30:23.520 --> 30:26.190
mortal enemies.
Come one, come all.

30:26.223 --> 30:27.534
I've been looking
to smooth things over

30:27.558 --> 30:29.193
with my enemies,
so perfect timing.

30:29.226 --> 30:31.329
Awesome, yeah.
It's the time.

30:33.063 --> 30:34.232
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

30:34.265 --> 30:37.201
Yes, wouldn't miss
it for the world.

30:37.234 --> 30:38.436
- Okay.
- Ow!

30:38.469 --> 30:40.037
Oh, my God.

30:40.070 --> 30:41.381
I think that man just
hit me with a muffin.

30:41.405 --> 30:43.941
It's not a man.
It's my brother.

30:43.974 --> 30:45.577
I'm sorry.
Let me go talk to him.

30:51.248 --> 30:53.050
Are you trying to ruin my life?

30:53.083 --> 30:54.361
There's my favorite
and only brother.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.025
Don't you wanna know
how the meeting went?

30:56.053 --> 30:57.464
Don't you wanna know how
the party planning is going?

30:57.488 --> 30:58.498
Actually, yeah,
that's why I'm here.

30:58.522 --> 31:00.024
Well, we've done nothing.

31:00.057 --> 31:01.459
Nine is useless.

31:01.492 --> 31:04.061
All he's done is send me
text messages of gifs.

31:04.094 --> 31:08.399
Well, in his defense,
Nine is a gif god.

31:08.432 --> 31:09.634
The party is tomorrow night!

31:09.667 --> 31:12.570
Chill, chill.
That's where I come in.

31:12.603 --> 31:14.071
What are you gonna do?

31:14.104 --> 31:17.408
Well, what if there
was a secret password

31:17.441 --> 31:20.645
and only people who know it
will be admitted?

31:20.678 --> 31:23.014
So like unlocking a hidden level
or something?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.181
Precisely.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:24.214 --> 31:25.349
But stay with me though.

31:25.382 --> 31:27.184
What if instead of a password,

31:27.217 --> 31:29.487
it's actually an app?

31:29.520 --> 31:32.189
And if you don't download it,
you can't get in.

31:32.222 --> 31:34.358
- Wow!
- Shut up, shut up.

31:34.391 --> 31:37.495
I thought you actually
cared about my party.

31:37.528 --> 31:38.696
I do.

31:38.729 --> 31:40.040
No, it's all about
your stupid app.

31:40.064 --> 31:43.200
Hey,<i> mi app es su app,</i> bro.

31:43.233 --> 31:44.502
My new company, your big party,

31:44.535 --> 31:47.371
they are flip sides
of the same coin.

31:47.404 --> 31:50.207
Let me show you how
a CEO gets things done.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.240
Come on.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.047
You want a great party?

31:56.080 --> 31:57.123
You can't just invite the people

31:57.147 --> 31:58.316
you think should be there.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.151
If you want an instant classic,

32:00.184 --> 32:02.987
it's all about the people
who shouldn't be there.

32:08.425 --> 32:10.962
Start with a clique that
never gets invited to parties.

32:13.497 --> 32:15.533
STU: <i> I used to be
in the drama club.</i>

32:15.566 --> 32:17.068
Perfect.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.235
While you guys all reminisce

32:18.268 --> 32:19.537
about that 8th grade production

32:19.570 --> 32:21.247
of "Annie Get Your Gun",
casually drop that

32:21.271 --> 32:23.049
you got invited to a party
tomorrow at Alex Finn's.

32:23.073 --> 32:25.643
Got invited to a party
tomorrow at Alex Finn's.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.715
Wasn't it Leibniz who said music

32:30.748 --> 32:32.717
is a hidden exercise
in arithmetic?

32:32.750 --> 32:35.419
DARIUS:
<i>I am on the calculus team.</i>

32:35.452 --> 32:37.555
And as everyone knows,
there's only one word

32:37.588 --> 32:39.432
that's exactly the same
in every single language.

32:39.456 --> 32:41.359
<i>Fiesta? Partido? Fete?</i>

32:44.261 --> 32:45.572
And from there,
my young Padawan learners,

32:45.596 --> 32:47.732
the word is out
and the party is on.

32:47.765 --> 32:50.201
Nobody knows who's hosting,
and nobody cares.

32:50.234 --> 32:53.504
<i>But come tomorrow night,
everybody's gonna be there.</i>

32:58.609 --> 33:01.412
Alex Finn's having a party?

33:01.445 --> 33:03.581
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

33:03.614 --> 33:05.383
You really think that'll work?

33:07.484 --> 33:09.354
It already has.

33:15.793 --> 33:20.431
<i>♪ From the spires

34:44.882 --> 34:47.418
Alexander Finn!

34:50.888 --> 34:53.357
Did you want to speak with me?

34:53.389 --> 34:55.192
What's up, dude?

34:55.225 --> 34:56.694
- Nothing much.
- 'Sup, dawg.

34:56.726 --> 34:57.795
Boom.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.469
'Sup, dawg?
How you living?

35:05.502 --> 35:08.672
- Just busy.
- Oh, really? Busy?

35:08.705 --> 35:11.876
Heard you might be real busy.

35:11.909 --> 35:15.312
- Planning something.
- I mean, um...

35:15.345 --> 35:17.548
I know about your little
soiree tomorrow night.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.886
I didn't mean for it
to get this big.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.721
I invited a couple
friends here and there,

35:23.754 --> 35:26.257
and all of a sudden everyone
just wanted to come.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.758
I don't want to hear it!

35:34.431 --> 35:37.468
Look, dude, I get it.

35:42.906 --> 35:45.242
I was a kid once, too, dude, all
right?

35:45.275 --> 35:48.245
So I'm gonna be straight
with you, Alexander.

35:48.278 --> 35:50.247
I'm not gonna bust
your party, dude.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.650
Really? You're not?

35:52.683 --> 35:55.252
Dude! Come on! Who am I?

35:55.285 --> 35:57.254
Remember who you're talking to.

35:57.287 --> 35:58.622
Yeah, man, I'm not whack.

35:58.655 --> 36:01.926
I'm lit.
I got a mixtape man.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.227
It's fire.

36:05.262 --> 36:08.432
But look, I do need to
ask you a question.

36:08.465 --> 36:09.667
Okay.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.877
And I need you to be
100% straight with me.

36:10.901 --> 36:13.271
Okay, all right.

36:15.472 --> 36:16.841
Is it cool if roll through?

36:19.309 --> 36:22.947
Uh, sure.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.783
That's, that's cool.

36:25.816 --> 36:27.284
Sick, dude!

36:27.317 --> 36:30.287
Whoo! Yeah!

36:30.320 --> 36:33.290
I needed this.
Thanks, bro.

36:33.323 --> 36:35.626
Awesome.
So I'll just come by.

36:35.659 --> 36:36.627
What time's the party?

36:36.660 --> 36:37.795
- 8:30.
- 8:30.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.430
Okay, on the late side.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.465
You can come whenever,
though. It's not...

36:41.498 --> 36:43.801
Seven o'clock?
Help you set up?

36:43.834 --> 36:46.771
Yes. Am I dismissed now?

36:49.339 --> 36:51.976
- Yeah, fam. Fo' sho.
- Okay.

36:52.009 --> 36:55.312
Fo' sho! See you at
the party tonight, playa!

36:55.345 --> 36:57.915
Rock on, fam.

37:00.651 --> 37:03.754
DAD ON SPEAKER:
<i>Hey, boys, it's your dad.</i>

37:03.787 --> 37:07.424
<i>How's it going over
there on the home front?</i>

37:07.457 --> 37:08.968
<i>I haven't gotten any
calls from the police,</i>

37:08.992 --> 37:11.262
<i>so that's a good sign.</i>

37:13.864 --> 37:15.499
<i>Anyway, I hope Mr. Delaney</i>

37:15.532 --> 37:17.334
<i>isn't giving you
too hard of a time.</i>

37:17.367 --> 37:19.503
<i>Oh, remember to set
the A/C to away mode</i>

37:19.536 --> 37:20.904
<i>if you're both
leaving the house.</i>

37:20.938 --> 37:24.908
<i>And no ordering any on-demand
movies unless you pay for them</i>

37:24.941 --> 37:27.845
Too much camo?

37:27.878 --> 37:29.680
<i>So, uh, what else?</i>

37:29.713 --> 37:33.851
<i>Yeah, um, we're about to hit
the hay.</i>

37:33.884 --> 37:36.287
<i>Love you both.
Good night.</i>

37:38.722 --> 37:40.357
Alex?

37:40.390 --> 37:41.692
Lo?

37:41.725 --> 37:43.360
The party doesn't start
for four hours.

37:43.393 --> 37:45.362
What are you doing
here so early?

37:45.395 --> 37:46.764
I just wanted
to give you a kiss.

37:46.797 --> 37:49.700
Oh, Lo.

37:49.733 --> 37:51.368
I love you.

37:51.401 --> 37:54.805
Shh.

38:04.414 --> 38:06.684
That is way too loud.

38:13.023 --> 38:14.058
No.

38:23.967 --> 38:26.870
Aah!

38:26.903 --> 38:29.940
Hi, Lo. It's me, Alex.

38:29.973 --> 38:33.377
Hey, no.

39:00.871 --> 39:02.606
Hey, what do you guys think?

39:02.639 --> 39:04.708
- Oh, Alex.
- A-sharp.

39:04.741 --> 39:07.845
- On fire.
- I'm digging it.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.848
Now aren't that cute?

39:10.881 --> 39:12.158
EJ: What up with the headphones?

39:12.182 --> 39:13.459
Makes it look like I don't care.

39:13.483 --> 39:15.085
Look, I'm not even plugged in.

39:15.118 --> 39:16.954
Nah, lose 'em.

39:16.987 --> 39:19.790
All right, party's about ready.

39:19.823 --> 39:21.792
Nine, you're working
security, man.

39:21.825 --> 39:23.460
Keep everybody out
of the front yard.

39:23.493 --> 39:24.795
Make sure that nobody gets in

39:24.828 --> 39:25.972
unless they've
downloaded the app

39:25.996 --> 39:27.131
and their data's disabled.

39:27.164 --> 39:28.465
No disabled people, got it.

39:28.498 --> 39:29.800
That's not what I said.

39:29.833 --> 39:32.002
Stu, you're handling
bugs and glitches.

39:32.035 --> 39:34.638
If I'm not too busy
finessing the ladies.

39:34.671 --> 39:37.875
I am not joking, Stuart!
This is serious!

39:37.908 --> 39:39.977
Darius.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.745
You're monitoring
the back end, buddy.

39:41.778 --> 39:44.848
I have been training for
this moment my entire life.

39:44.881 --> 39:46.150
Good man.

39:46.183 --> 39:48.819
- Alex.
- Yes.

39:48.852 --> 39:51.622
Try to keep in mind that this
is not just a house party.

39:51.655 --> 39:55.959
This is the most important
night of my... of our careers.

39:55.992 --> 39:58.495
I know.

39:58.528 --> 40:00.697
Make sure you don't burn
the house to the ground.

40:00.730 --> 40:03.801
Try to have a little fun, too.

40:03.834 --> 40:05.769
- All right?
- All right.

40:05.802 --> 40:09.006
I'll be monitoring everything
from the Milton cam.

40:09.039 --> 40:14.445
Uh, guys? I think we might have a
minor, minor issue.

40:14.478 --> 40:16.513
Dude, I don't have time for issues.
What is this?

40:16.546 --> 40:18.546
Look what happens when I
click on a user's profile.

40:20.016 --> 40:22.719
- Oh, my goodness gracious.
- Yeah.

40:22.752 --> 40:24.897
I'm kidding. I have no idea
what you're trying to show me.

40:24.921 --> 40:27.191
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

40:27.224 --> 40:30.194
We have full access
to people's phones.

40:30.227 --> 40:32.696
I mean, what happened to
the privacy firewall, Stu?

40:32.729 --> 40:36.200
Did I forget to plug it in?

40:36.233 --> 40:38.202
Uh, all right, look,
all I know is that this is

40:38.235 --> 40:39.937
super secure cloud software

40:39.970 --> 40:42.072
and if you guys figured out
a way to muck it up...

40:42.105 --> 40:44.241
Okay, Stu screwed up,
but it's an easy fix,

40:44.274 --> 40:45.943
and we're gonna get on it ASAP.

40:45.976 --> 40:47.177
All right.
I'm gonna be late.

40:47.210 --> 40:48.812
You twerps got this?

40:48.845 --> 40:50.881
Just go. I'll patch
the security network.

40:50.914 --> 40:52.149
It'll take 15 minutes.

40:52.182 --> 40:54.084
Now we're talking, Patch Adams.

40:54.117 --> 40:56.253
I will see you guys
at around nine.

40:56.286 --> 40:59.723
You will text me if there
are any other problems, okay?

41:07.964 --> 41:09.266
ELLIE ON SPEAKER:
<i>EJ, it's Ellie.</i>

41:09.299 --> 41:10.934
<i>We're running late.</i>

41:10.967 --> 41:12.569
<i>Jonathan insisted on
telling the driver</i>

41:12.602 --> 41:13.779
<i>how to get to the
hotel and got lost,</i>

41:13.803 --> 41:15.105
<i>and then of course blamed me</i>

41:15.138 --> 41:16.907
<i>for giving him
the wrong address.</i>

41:16.940 --> 41:19.209
<i>Anyways, can we please
just impress the pants off</i>

41:19.242 --> 41:20.644
<i>this writer and Owen tonight</i>

41:20.677 --> 41:22.646
<i>so I can prove Jonathan wrong?</i>

41:22.679 --> 41:26.283
<i>I mean, let's kill it.
You're gonna kill it.</i>

41:26.316 --> 41:28.118
<i>We have a great idea.</i>

41:28.151 --> 41:29.820
<i>So meet us at the bar,</i>

41:29.853 --> 41:31.822
<i>and maybe go over
your pitch again,</i>

41:31.855 --> 41:34.224
<i>and again, and then, like,
maybe one more time.</i>

41:34.257 --> 41:37.294
<i>And please don't say
anything weird tonight, okay?</i>

41:37.327 --> 41:39.530
<i>Oh, and don't order
anything too strong</i>

41:39.563 --> 41:40.731
<i>before we get there.</i>

41:40.764 --> 41:42.933
<i>I need you focused.</i>

41:44.301 --> 41:46.803
Oh! Oh, scrumptious.

41:46.836 --> 41:48.972
Oh, that's fire.

41:49.005 --> 41:51.174
Yo, before y'all
finish that patch,

41:51.207 --> 41:55.646
let me hit a lick and
just get like five minutes

53:32.842 --> 53:36.012
Let me talk to your father.

53:36.045 --> 53:38.281
Of course, yes.
Let me go get him.

53:43.519 --> 53:46.656
DAD ON SPEAKER: <i>Hey,
how's it going over there?</i>

53:46.689 --> 53:48.324
Is that you, Arthur?

53:48.357 --> 53:50.293
<i>Hey, how's it going
over there, Mr. Delaney?</i>

53:50.326 --> 53:53.997
I didn't realize you and
the missus are back already.

53:54.030 --> 53:56.332
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:56.365 --> 53:58.334
Do the boys have
some people over?

53:58.367 --> 54:02.338
Because I've been
hearing this noise.

54:02.371 --> 54:03.840
<i>No, we're about to hit the hay.</i>

54:03.873 --> 54:05.808
Are you sure?

54:05.841 --> 54:07.343
<i>No, we're about to hit the hay.</i>

54:07.376 --> 54:08.720
- He already said that one.
- I know!

54:08.744 --> 54:11.414
- Change it up!
- I'm trying. Shut up!

54:11.447 --> 54:13.016
I can only keep this
going for so long.

54:13.049 --> 54:15.685
- Well, keep doing it.
- Okey-dokey.

54:15.718 --> 54:17.454
<i>Good night. Love you.</i>

54:18.721 --> 54:20.690
All I had was "I love you."

54:20.723 --> 54:22.025
He didn't record anything else.

54:22.058 --> 54:23.293
He thinks we love him now.

54:23.326 --> 54:25.028
<i>Good night, Mr. Delaney.</i>
