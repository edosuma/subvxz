WEBVTT

00:05.250 --> 00:06.289
Mel: RYDER,

00:06.290 --> 00:08.039
YOU'RE JOINING THE NAVY?

00:08.040 --> 00:09.040
YEP.

00:10.290 --> 00:14.040
JUST SO I'M CLEAR, THE
UNITED STATES NAVY?

00:15.080 --> 00:17.379
THAT'S THE ONE. IT
WAS LENNOX'S IDEA.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.999
WHOA, YOU CAN'T PIN THIS ON ME.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.379
NO, I TOLD YOU TO PUT ON PANTS
AND GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.329
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS NOTHING
LIKE, "JOIN THE NAVY."

00:23.330 --> 00:25.169
YOU TOLD ME TO GET
MY OLD JOB BACK.

00:25.170 --> 00:27.080
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE,
"JOIN THE NAVY" EITHER.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.419
RIGHT, BUT WHEN I WENT DOWN
TO THE LASER TAG PLACE

00:30.420 --> 00:32.669
TO GET MY OLD JOB BACK,
IT'D GONE OUT OF BUSINESS

00:32.670 --> 00:36.119
AND INSTEAD, EXACTLY WHERE IT USED
TO BE WAS A NAVY RECRUITING CENTER.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.170
I MEAN, IF THAT'S NOT FATE,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT...

00:39.290 --> 00:40.920
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.169
RYDER, YOU CAN'T BE IN THE NAVY!

00:44.170 --> 00:45.080
YOU DON'T THINK I
COULD HANDLE IT?

00:45.081 --> 00:46.119
NO!

00:46.120 --> 00:47.879
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
YOU WERE TELLING ME

00:47.880 --> 00:49.329
ABOUT THAT TIME YOU
WERE IN THE SHOWER

00:49.330 --> 00:51.169
AND YOU WERE FASCINATED
BY THE SHOWER HEAD

00:51.170 --> 00:53.079
AND YOU WERE STARING AT IT AND
FORGOT TO CLOSE YOUR MOUTH

00:53.080 --> 00:54.539
AND YOU ALMOST DROWNED?

00:54.540 --> 00:56.210
YOU ALMOST DROWNED IN
THE SHOWER, RYDER!

00:57.210 --> 00:59.329
YEAH, AND PLUS A
GIRL DUMPS YOUR ASS

00:59.330 --> 01:00.379
AND YOU JOIN THE NAVY?

01:00.380 --> 01:01.959
I MEAN, THAT'S SO CLICHE.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.499
OKAY, MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING
STARTED ABOUT A GIRL,

01:04.500 --> 01:07.419
BUT I GOT DOWN THERE AND THE
RECRUITER STARTED TALKING TO ME

01:07.420 --> 01:11.039
ABOUT GOALS AND DIRECTION AND
DOING SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.829
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU
GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT.

01:12.830 --> 01:13.919
LISTEN, RYDER...

01:13.920 --> 01:14.960
WHAT IS THAT, A DRUG TEST?

01:16.540 --> 01:17.750
LOOKS LIKE IT'S NEGATIVE.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.460
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.460
MY NEPHEW WANTS
TO JOIN THE NAVY.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.880
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO CRY ABOUT FIRST.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.119
I'M HERE FOR YOU, BABY.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.790
AW, AUNT MEL.

01:32.790 --> 01:34.669
(sighs) I'M HERE FOR YOU, TOO.

01:34.670 --> 01:36.710
HEY, ME TOO.

01:40.330 --> 01:41.790
SO, WHO ELSE IS HUNGRY?

01:42.790 --> 01:44.539
(theme music playing)

01:44.540 --> 01:46.079

02:10.330 --> 02:11.880
WHICH THAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.249
RYDER AND THE NAVY,
THAT'S JUST CRAZY!

02:15.250 --> 02:17.670
YES, YES. NO, OF COURSE THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT YOU MEANT.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.039
YOU THOUGHT I MEANT
THE NON-PREGNANCY.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.789
YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY, JOE.

02:21.790 --> 02:22.919
YOU CAN SAY IT.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.079
I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK INTO
A MILLION LITTLE PIECES.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.960
(sobs) OH, JOE!

02:28.080 --> 02:29.959
OH, HONEY, COME ON. LOOK,
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.209
HERE.

02:31.210 --> 02:35.829
I KNOW, IT'S JUST THE STRESS OF MONTHS
OF TRYING AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT.

02:35.830 --> 02:36.919
I KNOW, I FEEL IT TOO.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.040
HEY, I DID SOME OF MY BEST WORK.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.919
MAYBE WE NEED TO SEE SOMEBODY,
LIKE A FERTILITY SPECIALIST.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.669
NO, NO, NO, HONEY.
WHAT WE NEED TO DO

02:45.670 --> 02:46.919
IS JUST FORGET ABOUT
THE WHOLE THING.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.670
YOU MEAN, NO SEX?

02:50.580 --> 02:51.880
I WOULD NEVER MEAN THAT.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.499
NO. NO, HONEY,

02:54.500 --> 02:55.619
IT'LL HAPPEN WHEN IT HAPPENS.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.669
HOW ABOUT THIS?

02:56.670 --> 02:59.959
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN MENTION THE WORD
BABY FOR LIKE THE NEXT MONTH.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.999
OKAY.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.039
BUT FIRST,

03:02.040 --> 03:03.119
I HAVE TO GET IT ALL
OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.419
OKAY.

03:04.420 --> 03:06.039
(clears throat) BABY, BABY, BABY.
BABY, BABY, BABY.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.789
(repeatedly shouts
rapidly) BABY!

03:07.790 --> 03:08.829
DONE.

03:08.830 --> 03:09.879
BABY!

03:09.880 --> 03:10.880
HMM.

03:10.881 --> 03:12.580
SORRY, THERE WAS JUST
ONE MORE LEFT IN THERE.

03:13.830 --> 03:14.879
(clears throat)

03:14.880 --> 03:16.249
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD. NOW,
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

03:16.250 --> 03:17.829
IS COME UP WITH SOMETHING
TO DISTRACT YOU.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.329
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
SOMETHING CALMING.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.379
SOMETHING RELAXING.

03:20.380 --> 03:22.579
WELL, HOW ABOUT WE FOCUS
ALL OF OUR ENERGIES

03:22.580 --> 03:24.079
ON KEEPING MY NEPHEW
FROM JOINING THE NAVY.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.829
I MEAN, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.039
HONEY, YOU SAY THAT LIKE JOINING
THE NAVY'S A BAD THING.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.459
IT IS...

03:29.460 --> 03:30.789
FOR THE NAVY!

03:30.790 --> 03:31.829
I MEAN,

03:31.830 --> 03:34.789
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF RYDER TRIED TO DO THE
STUFF THEY DO IN THOSE NAVY COMMERCIALS,

03:34.790 --> 03:36.619
HE'D BE STEERING
JETS INTO THE OCEAN

03:36.620 --> 03:38.249
AND CAPSIZING BATTLESHIPS AND...
(gasps)

03:38.250 --> 03:40.249
JOE, ALL THOSE
PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.040
I MEAN, THEY'LL
BE SITTING DUCKS.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.329
HONEY, LOOK, MY COUSIN NUNZIO
WENT INTO THE AIRFORCE.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.379
ALL RIGHT, HE WASHED OUT OF
BASIC TRAINING AFTER ONE MONTH.

03:48.380 --> 03:51.169
THERE IS NO WAY RYDER IS GONNA
MAKE IT THROUGH NAVY BOOTCAMP.

03:51.170 --> 03:52.879
YEAH, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.250
WELL, HE'S ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

03:57.540 --> 03:58.829
STOP!

03:58.830 --> 04:00.459
QUIT YOUR SNOOZE AND
GRAB YOUR SHOES.

04:00.460 --> 04:02.959
JOE, WHAT THE HELL?
IT'S FIVE A.M.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.830
THAT'S RIGHT, RECRUIT.

04:03.831 --> 04:05.209
WELCOME TO LONGO BOOTCAMP.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.079
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, IF YOU
CAN SURVIVE A WEEK WITH ME,

04:07.080 --> 04:09.119
MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE WHAT
THE NAVY CAN DISH OUT.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.169
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, FINE.

04:10.170 --> 04:12.619
WHATEVER, JUST... WAKE
ME UP IN TEN MINUTES.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.959
YEAH.

04:13.960 --> 04:14.999
SURE, OKAY.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.789
TEN MINUTES WORKS. YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE, UM...

04:16.790 --> 04:19.380
THE NAVY'S FAMOUS FOR
ITS SNOOZE BUTTON.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.540
AH!

04:23.960 --> 04:25.170
MAN OVERBOARD.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.120
- HEY.
- HEY.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.459
THE "NEEDLE EXCHANGE"?

04:31.460 --> 04:33.789
ISN'T THAT THE KNITTING
PLACE ON HIGH STREET?

04:33.790 --> 04:36.079
YEAH, MY FRIEND BETH HAS
BEEN TRYING TO GET ME

04:36.080 --> 04:38.619
TO JOIN HER KNITTING CLASS FOR
YEARS NOW, SO I FINALLY DID.

04:38.620 --> 04:39.829
LOOK WHAT I MADE.

04:39.830 --> 04:41.289
VERY NICE.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.329
WHAT IS IT?

04:43.330 --> 04:44.379
IT'S A BEDSPREAD.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.710
FOR AN ELF?

04:46.710 --> 04:48.249
MY FINGERS GOT TIRED.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.879
SO, WHY'D YOU LET YOUR FRIEND
BETH TALK YOU INTO KNITTING NOW?

04:50.880 --> 04:53.829
OH, WELL, JOE SUGGESTED I DO
SOMETHING TO TAKE MY MIND

04:53.830 --> 04:56.500
OFF THE SUBJECT WE
AGREED NOT TO MENTION.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.920
THAT JOE SECRETLY EATS
CANDY BARS IN THE GARAGE?

05:00.920 --> 05:02.329
NO, I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE "B" WORD.

05:02.330 --> 05:03.709
BABIES?

05:03.710 --> 05:06.830
SHH, DO NOT UTTER
THE FORBIDDEN WORD.

05:07.920 --> 05:08.880
- WHOO!
- HEY, HON.

05:08.881 --> 05:10.169
I THOUGHT RYDER WAS WITH YOU.

05:10.170 --> 05:11.619
YEAH, WE JUST RAN THREE MILES.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.789
WELL, ACTUALLY I
RAN THREE MILES.

05:13.790 --> 05:16.879
HE RAN ONE, CRAWLED
ONE, AND UM...

05:16.880 --> 05:18.080
HE CRIED ONE.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.539
SO WHERE IS HE?

05:20.540 --> 05:23.120
RIGHT NOW? HE'S DOWN THE BLOCK PUKING
IN THE HENDERSON'S BIRD FOUNTAIN.

05:24.710 --> 05:25.920
IT'S BEEN A GOOD DAY.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.499
OH, KNITTING I SEE.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.330
SO... OKAY, SO YOU FOUND SOMETHING
TO KEEP YOUR MIND OFF OF UM...

05:32.330 --> 05:33.829
- BABIES.
- LENNOX!

05:33.830 --> 05:35.580
I'M SORRY, IT JUST CAME OUT.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.619
HEY, THERE HE IS!

05:38.620 --> 05:39.709
HOW'D YOU LIKE THAT RUN?

05:39.710 --> 05:41.330
IT WAS REFRESHING. (grunts)

05:43.040 --> 05:44.079
NOW, COME ON.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.079
LET'S GO, I WANT YOU TO PUT
YOUR SWIMSUIT ON, ALL RIGHT?

05:46.080 --> 05:47.919
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE HEADING
OUT INTO THE GARAGE.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.879
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO
THE DRIVEWAY AND I'M GONNA

05:49.880 --> 05:51.379
HOSE YOU DOWN WHILE
YOU DO SOME BURPEES.

05:51.380 --> 05:52.380
WHY?

05:53.380 --> 05:54.750
THERE'S NO "WHY"
IN LONG BOOTCAMP.

05:55.710 --> 05:56.749
WHY?

05:56.750 --> 05:58.880
HEY! DON'T ASK ME WHY, RECRUIT!
JUST DO IT.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.709
BUT IT'S 50 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.079
IS THAT A LITTLE
TOO COLD FOR YOU?

06:04.080 --> 06:05.669
OKAY. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

06:05.670 --> 06:09.289
YOU CAN JUST RING THE CHICKEN AND WE'LL
BE ALL DONE WITH THIS WHOLE EXPERIMENT.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.789
OKAY? REALLY. GO AHEAD.

06:10.790 --> 06:12.119
COME ON, BOY.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.709
HIT THAT QUITTIN' CHICKEN.
I KNOW YOU WANNA DO IT.

06:13.710 --> 06:14.710
LET'S GO.

06:15.830 --> 06:17.209
NO.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.170
I'M NOT GONNA TOUCH
THE CHICKEN, JOE.

06:21.420 --> 06:22.620
PUTTING ON MY SWIMSUIT.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.749
JOE, THIS IS CRUEL AND
UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT.

06:29.750 --> 06:30.789
YOU'RE KILLING HIM.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.330
THANK YOU.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.579
OUT OF BED OR I BREAK YOUR HEAD!

06:42.580 --> 06:44.329
I CAN'T MOVE!

06:44.330 --> 06:45.829
IT EVEN HURTS TO THINK.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.999
CAN WE MAYBE SKIP TODAY

06:48.000 --> 06:50.709
AND JUST DO MORE
BOOTCAMP STUFF TOMORROW.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.499
YEAH, BECAUSE... THE NAVY.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.669
I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST A
JOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE...

06:54.670 --> 06:56.580
EVERY OTHER DAY.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.539
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

06:59.540 --> 07:00.579
YEAH.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.119
YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE
ON TO SOMETHING.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.669
'CAUSE WE SHOULD ONLY FIGHT OUR
WARS ON ODD-NUMBERED DAYS.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.619
OBVIOUSLY, WE JUST HAVE TO TEXT OUR ENEMY,
SO WE KNOW WHICH DAY'S THEY SLEEP IN ON

07:07.620 --> 07:08.669
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

07:08.670 --> 07:10.289
ON YOUR FEET, RECRUIT!

07:10.290 --> 07:11.419
(groans) I CAN'T!

07:11.420 --> 07:13.420
I DON'T THINK I
HAVE FEET ANYMORE.

07:14.580 --> 07:16.459
IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.039
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M PROUD OF
YOU FOR AT LEAST TRYING.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.539
I MEAN, NOT A LOT OF GUYS ARE CUT
OUT TO BE IN THE NAVY. YOU KNOW?

07:21.540 --> 07:23.669
SO YOU WASHED OUT ON
THIS ONE, IT'S OKAY.

07:23.670 --> 07:24.670
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:24.671 --> 07:26.999
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE,

07:27.000 --> 07:28.039
AND I'M GONNA BE HERE FOR YOU.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.040
SLEEP IN, HAVE A GREAT
REST OF YOUR MORNING.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.499
WASHED OUT?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.289
WHO'S WASHED OUT?

07:38.290 --> 07:39.540
(groans) OH, GOD.

07:40.580 --> 07:42.669
TELL ME AGAIN HOW YOU
CRUSHED HIS SPIRIT.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.709
IT RELAXES ME.

07:44.710 --> 07:47.619
WELL, HONEY, I TOOK HIM FOR A
LITTLE RIDE ON THE PAIN TRAIN.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.959
ALL RIGHT? RIGHT NOW, RYDER
CAN'T EVEN STAND UP.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.209
THANK YOU, JOE LONGO.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.379
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

07:53.380 --> 07:55.079
HEY, KEEPING THAT
KID OUT OF THE NAVY

07:55.080 --> 07:56.919
SAYS THAT I'M NOT JUST
A GOOD MAN, HONEY.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.380
I'M A GOOD AMERICAN.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.619
LET'S GO, LONGO!

08:01.620 --> 08:02.920
WHAT'S ON TODAY'S TORTURE MENU?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.209
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING?

08:05.210 --> 08:06.249
NOPE.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.499
YOU KNOW, IT FINALLY HIT ME.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.579
YOU'RE PUSHING ME SO HARD

08:08.580 --> 08:09.789
BECAUSE YOU CARE.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.459
SO I'M GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.460
I'M GONNA GET THROUGH
THIS FOR YOU, JOE.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.079
YOUR LITTLE PLAN BACKFIRED.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.750
I'M OFFICIALLY UN-THANKING YOU.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.669
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

08:20.670 --> 08:21.879
ALL RIGHT, TOUGH GUY.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.119
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

08:23.120 --> 08:24.329
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO;

08:24.330 --> 08:25.919
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT
INTO THE DRIVEWAY,

08:25.920 --> 08:28.079
YOU'RE GONNA HOLD THESE JUGS
OUT TO YOUR SIDES LIKE THIS

08:28.080 --> 08:29.119
UNTIL I SAY STOP.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.879
- EASY.
- YEAH?

08:30.880 --> 08:32.419
SAY THAT WHEN THEY'RE
FILLED UP WITH WATER.

08:32.420 --> 08:33.619
LET'S GO! (chuckles)

08:33.620 --> 08:34.620
YEAH.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.250
OW!

08:46.710 --> 08:47.959
OH, WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

08:47.960 --> 08:50.079
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU... WHY
AREN'T YOU IN SCHOOL?

08:50.080 --> 08:51.709
IT'S SATURDAY.

08:51.710 --> 08:54.579
(scoffs) THAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

08:54.580 --> 08:57.459
YOU KNOW, THOSE LOOK
AMAZINGLY LIKE CLOTHES

08:57.460 --> 08:59.329
FOR ONE OF THOSE
CUTE LITTLE THINGS

08:59.330 --> 09:00.539
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.579
WHAT? NO!

09:02.580 --> 09:04.419
THAT WOULD BE CRAZY

09:04.420 --> 09:08.459
TO BUY CLOTHES LIKE THESE
WHEN I'M NOT EVEN PREGNANT.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.459
OH, WAIT SO YOU KNITTED THOSE
IN YOUR KNITTING CLASS?

09:11.460 --> 09:13.749
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.750
YES, I AM. (giggles)

09:16.830 --> 09:18.289
OH! TEACH ME.

09:18.290 --> 09:19.459
NO, I WON'T.

09:19.460 --> 09:20.669
WAIT, WHAT? WHY NOT?

09:20.670 --> 09:22.119
BECAUSE I'M VERY BUSY.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.539
WELL, PLEASE!

09:23.540 --> 09:24.789
BUT YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THIS.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.499
COME ON, SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.539
(sighs)

09:27.540 --> 09:29.289
OKAY, UM... YEAH, SURE.

09:29.290 --> 09:31.419
I GUESS I COULD SQUEEZE
IN A QUICK LESSON,

09:31.420 --> 09:33.379
TEACH YOU SOME BASICS.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.419
SO, THESE ARE YOUR
KNITTING NEEDLES.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.919
WE CALL THEM NEEDLES.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.709
YEAH, UM...

09:40.710 --> 09:43.419
SO YOU WANT TO FEEL
THEM, YOU KNOW, LIKE...

09:43.420 --> 09:47.579
LIKE, RELAX YOUR WRISTS, AND JUST...
YEAH, LIKE THIS.

09:47.580 --> 09:48.619
LIKE...

09:48.620 --> 09:50.619
LIKE THIS?

09:50.620 --> 09:51.420
GOOD! GOOD!

09:51.421 --> 09:53.539
YOU KNOW, LIKE
YOU'RE EATING PASTA.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.579
AHH!

09:54.580 --> 09:55.749
UH-HUH.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.619
YEAH! LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.119
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.169
WAIT, WHAT?

10:00.170 --> 10:01.459
WHY DON'T I GET TO
TRY IT WITH YARN?

10:01.460 --> 10:03.499
WHOA, SLOW DOWN SPEEDRACER.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.959
OKAY, WE DON'T GET TO
YARN FOR A LONG TIME.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.079
AUNT MEL, YOU HAVE SO
MUCH YARN RIGHT HERE.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.790
NO. NO, NO, NO. NO, DON'T!

10:10.790 --> 10:14.619
WOW! LOOK AT
EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO.

10:14.620 --> 10:15.879
- MM-HMM.
- OH!

10:15.880 --> 10:17.710
YOU CAN EVEN KNIT...

10:18.710 --> 10:20.420
LEATHER.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.210
WELL, I AM THE
FIRST IN MY CLASS.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.289
OKAY, LOOK, WHEN I GOT
TO THE KNITTING CLASS,

10:27.290 --> 10:28.919
IT WAS RIGHT NEXT
DOOR TO ONE OF THESE

10:28.920 --> 10:30.119
"B" WORD STORES.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.579
AND SO, I WENT INSIDE
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW...

10:32.580 --> 10:34.329
THE CLOTHES ARE ADORABLE,

10:34.330 --> 10:37.710
AND BECAUSE I WANT A
"B" WORD, DAMMIT!

10:39.500 --> 10:41.079
WHY ARE YOU HIDING ALL THIS?

10:41.080 --> 10:43.379
BECAUSE... I DON'T
WANT JOE TO KNOW.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.499
YOU KNOW, WE HAD AN AGREEMENT

10:44.500 --> 10:45.919
AND HE'LL JUST THINK I'M CRAZY.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.539
AUNT MEL, NOBODY'S GONNA
THINK THAT YOU'VE GONE CRAZY

10:48.540 --> 10:50.329
JUST BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT
A FEW BABY THINGS

10:50.330 --> 10:51.830
TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER.

10:58.330 --> 10:59.330
(toy squeaks)

11:07.830 --> 11:11.499
("Rock-A-Bye-Baby" plays)

11:11.500 --> 11:15.079
HOW MUCH BABY STUFF DID YOU BUY?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.619
HEY, I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM, OKAY?

11:16.620 --> 11:17.829
I CAN STOP WHENEVER I WANT.

11:17.830 --> 11:21.329
OKAY, SO WE CAN RETURN ALL THIS?

11:21.330 --> 11:23.329
YES. WELL, BUT NOT THIS.

11:23.330 --> 11:26.209
OR THIS, OR THIS...
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

11:26.210 --> 11:27.380
I'M KEEPING IT ALL!

11:30.880 --> 11:32.669
JOE, ISN'T RYDER SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THE FRONT PORCH,

11:32.670 --> 11:34.039
HOLDING UP THOSE WATER JUGS?

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
HE'S NOT?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.419
HA HA! HE WENT AWOL.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.749
I KNEW I COULD BREAK HIM.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.499
I KNEW HE COULDN'T HANDLE IT, HONEY.
I KNEW IT. LISTEN,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.039
I DON'T WANT YOU TO
TAKE OFFENSE TO THIS,

11:42.040 --> 11:45.379
BUT, UM... YOUR NEPHEW?
HE'S A LITTLE SOFT.

11:45.380 --> 11:47.210
(chuckles) OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?
HE'S A LOT SOFT.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.669
I TELL YOU, HE'S LIKE A
BIG BOWL FULL OF PUDDING.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.079
YOU KNOW? (chuckles)

11:52.080 --> 11:53.829
I MEAN, I SHOULDN'T
MAKE FUN, YOU KNOW?

11:53.830 --> 11:56.169
HONESTLY, I MEAN HE'S PROBABLY CURLED
UP SOMEWHERE CRYING RIGHT NOW.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.959
UM, JOE?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.669
DOES THAT LOOK BROKEN TO YOU?

11:59.670 --> 12:01.169
DOES WHAT LOOK...

12:01.170 --> 12:02.380
HOLY CRAP.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.419
OKAY.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.919
ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S A LITTLE
STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.419
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

12:13.420 --> 12:15.619
BOOTCAMP IS NOT JUST ABOUT USING
THESE MUSCLES, ALL RIGHT?

12:15.620 --> 12:17.750
IT'S ALSO ABOUT USING THE
MOST IMPORTANT MUSCLE.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.750
HIS WEINER?

12:23.880 --> 12:25.289
NO! NO, THE MUSCLE IN HERE.

12:25.290 --> 12:26.329
HIS BRAIN.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.499
DO IT, JOE.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.250
BREAK HIS BRAIN.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.749
OKAY, AUNT MEL, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO STOP BUYING BABY STUFF.

12:38.750 --> 12:42.919
YES, BUT THIS WAS
HANDCRAFTED BY THE AMISH.

12:42.920 --> 12:47.419
THE AMISH? AND YOU DIDN'T
PICK ONE UP FOR ME?

12:47.420 --> 12:49.329
HA HA HA, LOOK JOE
IS BUSY WITH RYDER,

12:49.330 --> 12:51.959
SO WE HAVE A VERY SHORT WINDOW TO GET
THIS IN TO THE HOUSE AND HIDDEN.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.039
OKAY, AUNT MEL. AUNT MEL,

12:54.040 --> 12:55.249
LISTEN TO THE WORDS I'M SAYING:

12:55.250 --> 13:00.709
YOU DON'T HAVE A BABY.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.249
I KNOW.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.879
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
TO HIDE THE BOX.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.079
COME ON, GIVE ME A HAND.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.670
LET'S GO, PULL IT. OH!

13:09.380 --> 13:11.039
COME ON, LET'S DO IT.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.749
JOE, IT'S MIDNIGHT,

13:12.750 --> 13:13.879
I'M EXHAUSTED.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.209
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
ME SINCE 5 A.M.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.249
I KNOW, I KNOW.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.999
BUT DON'T WORRY, THIS IS
GONNA BE A PIECE OF CAKE

13:18.000 --> 13:19.039
'CAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

13:19.040 --> 13:22.329
IS TURN THIS INTO THIS,

13:22.330 --> 13:24.209
AN ORIGAMI CRANE.

13:24.210 --> 13:25.249
OKAY.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.289
1,000 TIMES.

13:26.290 --> 13:27.829
- WHAT?
- YEP.

13:27.830 --> 13:29.499
ALL RIGHT, AND THEY ALL
HAVE TO BE IDENTICAL.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.500
AND YOU HAVE TO GET
IT ALL DONE BY DAWN.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.499
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.919
OH, OKAY.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.500
WHY DON'T WE GO TELL THAT
TO THE QUITTIN' CHICKEN?

13:40.330 --> 13:41.330
NO.

13:43.420 --> 13:44.459
GOOD.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.879
WHOA, LOOK AT THE TIME, MAN.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.880
I GOTTA GET TO BED.

13:52.380 --> 13:56.169
SO THE CRANE TEST IS HOW THE JAPANESE WEED
OUT APPLICANTS FOR THEIR SPACE PROGRAM.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.749
FOLDING A THOUSAND OF
THESE THINGS ON NO SLEEP,

13:58.750 --> 14:02.119
REQUIRES ALMOST A
ZEN-LIKE CONCENTRATION.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.329
OH, I LIKE IT.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.209
RYDER CAN'T EVEN
FOLD HIS T-SHIRTS.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.879
YEAH. SO, LOOK I WANT
YOU TO PREPARE YOURSELF

14:07.880 --> 14:09.709
TO SEE A BROKEN MAN WHEN
YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS, OKAY?

14:09.710 --> 14:12.329
AND HONEY, I'M JUST
WARNING YOU NOW,

14:12.330 --> 14:14.080
IT'S NOT GONNA BE PRETTY.

14:15.290 --> 14:17.709
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE.
IT'S NOT PRETTY.

14:17.710 --> 14:19.710
IT'S FRICKIN' BEAUTIFUL!

14:23.830 --> 14:25.709
RYDER DID ALL THIS?

14:25.710 --> 14:26.959
OVERNIGHT?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.960
ON NO SLEEP?

14:30.080 --> 14:31.120
THEY'RE...

14:34.120 --> 14:36.120
THEY'RE PERFECT.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.079
HEY.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.379
"SORRY, JOE. THERE
ARE ONLY 999 CRANES.

14:43.380 --> 14:46.459
"I HAD TO SNEEZE AND
DIDN'T HAVE A TISSUE.

14:46.460 --> 14:50.120
"SINCERELY, RYDER SCANLON,
UNITED STATES NAVY, FUTURE."

14:51.460 --> 14:52.749
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS.

14:52.750 --> 14:56.289
I THOUGHT FOR SURE THAT
THIS WOULD BREAK HIM.

14:56.290 --> 14:59.619
BUT IT... IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOT THE BRAINS,

14:59.620 --> 15:01.619
THE BRAWN, AND THE SPIRIT.

15:01.620 --> 15:04.079
WELL, YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.289
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE.

15:05.290 --> 15:06.329
ARE YOU SAYING...?

15:06.330 --> 15:07.959
YEAH.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.960
HE DID IT.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.460
THAT MAGNIFICENT
BASTARD BROKE ME.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.459
HE REALLY SURPRISED ME, MEL.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.289
I MEAN, MAYBE RYDER REALLY
DOES HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF.

15:22.290 --> 15:23.789
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.379
MY LITTLE NEPHEW IS NOT
JOINING THE NAVY, OKAY?

15:25.380 --> 15:26.709
HE'S STILL A LITTLE BOY.

15:26.710 --> 15:30.079
HE'S THE THIRD TALLEST
BUILDING IN TOLEDO.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.669
OKAY, FINE, HE'S A
VERY LARGE LITTLE BOY.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.249
BUT SINCE YOU FAILED... FAILED!

15:34.250 --> 15:35.539
- WAIT!
- JOSEPH LONGO,

15:35.540 --> 15:37.169
IT IS MY TURN.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.999
REALLY? WHAT COULD YOU DO TO HIM
THAT I HAVEN'T ALREADY TRIED?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.079
OH, I'M GONNA CRY.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.209
I'M GONNA CRY SO HARD,

15:42.210 --> 15:43.669
HE IS GONNA FEEL SO GUILTY

15:43.670 --> 15:45.119
HE IS NEVER GONNA LEAVE
THIS HOUSE AGAIN,

15:45.120 --> 15:46.249
EVER.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.789
MEL, THAT'S LIKE
EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.

15:48.790 --> 15:52.499
FINE, JOE. THEN WE'LL JUST LET
HIM GO OFF AND JOIN THE NAVY

15:52.500 --> 15:55.079
AND I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO ENJOY
MYSELF FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AGAIN.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.079
OKAY, HONEY, I'M SORRY.
GO TRY IT, GO AHEAD.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.040
I'M GOOD, AREN'T I?

16:03.120 --> 16:05.120
GLAD SHE'S ON MY SIDE.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.170
MOST OF THE TIME.

16:14.670 --> 16:17.119
(sobbing)

16:17.120 --> 16:18.250
(cries) RYDER.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.419
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:22.420 --> 16:24.999
YEAH, SOMEBODY HID THIS
CRIB IN MY CLOSET.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.379
YEAH, THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ME.

16:28.380 --> 16:31.289
OH, HEY. THE INSTRUCTIONS.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.709
COULD HAVE USED THOSE.

16:33.710 --> 16:35.039
UH, LISTEN, RYDER,

16:35.040 --> 16:38.619
I JUST CAME UP HERE TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT THIS WHOLE NAVY THING.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.209
OH, YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

16:40.210 --> 16:41.669
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

16:41.670 --> 16:44.119
AFTER I SHIP OUT, YOU GUYS CAN
USE THIS ROOM AS A NURSERY.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.919
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE BABY COMES.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.789
IT'S LIKE, THE OLD KID MOVES
OUT, THE NEW KID MOVES IN.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.619
CIRCLE OF LIFE.

16:50.620 --> 16:53.169
OH, RYDER.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.789
OH, NO.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.169
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:57.170 --> 16:58.459
THAT CRYING ACT'S
NOT GONNA WORK.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.959
I HELD WATER JUGS
UP FOR FIVE HOURS

17:00.960 --> 17:05.079
AND I JUST SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT FOLDING
FREAKING JAPANESE ASTRONAUT CRANES.

17:05.080 --> 17:07.209
TEARS ARE NOT GONNA
CHANGE MY MIND.

17:07.210 --> 17:08.579
(sighs)

17:08.580 --> 17:10.999
I'M NOT CRYING TO
CHANGE YOUR MIND NOW.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.619
I'M CRYING BECAUSE YOU'VE
GROWN INTO A REAL MAN.

17:16.620 --> 17:19.039
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
JOIN THE NAVY.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.169
AND THE NAVY WOULD BE
LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

17:22.170 --> 17:26.120
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK SO HANDSOME
IN YOUR POPEYE SUIT.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.790
SCRUNCH DOWN, I CAN'T REACH YOU.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.829
SO, MAYBE THIS NAVY
THING IS A GREAT IDEA.

17:35.830 --> 17:37.289
RYDER'S MATURED.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.579
HE'S A MAN NOW.

17:38.580 --> 17:41.959
HE'S GOT THE RIGHT STUFF.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.999
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT I SAID EARLIER?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.169
IT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.

17:47.170 --> 17:49.169
NOW I AM SAYING IT.

17:49.170 --> 17:51.669
THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP.

17:51.670 --> 17:56.329
("Rock-A-Bye-Baby" plays)

17:56.330 --> 17:58.039
WHAT IS THAT?

17:58.040 --> 17:59.119
OH, THAT'S MY PHONE.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.290
THAT'S MY PHONE
AND NOTHING MORE.

18:05.960 --> 18:06.960
SHOULDN'T YOU ANSWER IT?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.289
NOPE.

18:09.290 --> 18:12.379
THAT'S NOT YOUR PHONE. NO.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.039
THAT'S NOT YOUR PHONE,
THAT'S COMING FROM

18:14.040 --> 18:15.079
SOMEWHERE OVER HERE
NEAR THE WINDOW...

18:15.080 --> 18:16.420
NO!

18:18.380 --> 18:20.879
WOW, HONEY, I'M SO
GLAD YOU STOPPED ME

18:20.880 --> 18:22.329
BECAUSE NOW I'M NOT
THE LEAST BIT CURIOUS

18:22.330 --> 18:23.620
AS TO WHAT'S IN
THIS WINDOW SEAT.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.960
- WHAT?
- ("Rock-A-Bye-Baby" plays)

18:31.830 --> 18:33.119
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

18:33.120 --> 18:36.079
(inhales deeply) YES.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.999
THESE, UM, BABY THINGS...

18:39.000 --> 18:40.419
I'M DONATING THEM TO THE POOR

18:40.420 --> 18:42.000
AND I WANTED TO SURPRISE THEM.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.959
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL
ME THAT'S THE TRUTH?

18:46.960 --> 18:52.249
LOOK, THERE'S A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON
WHY I BOUGHT ALL THIS STUFF, OKAY?

18:52.250 --> 18:54.289
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D FIND OUT.

18:54.290 --> 18:55.879
MEL...

18:55.880 --> 18:56.959
LOOK, I KNOW. I KNOW.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.119
I KNOW WE AGREED TO PUT
BABIES ON THE BACKBURNER,

18:59.120 --> 19:00.999
WHICH SOUNDS VERY
DANGEROUS, BY THE WAY,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.459
BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.999
AND I COULDN'T, YOU KNOW?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.959
I WANT TO KEEP THINKING
ABOUT BABIES, JOE.

19:07.960 --> 19:12.829
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T STOP
BUYING ALL THIS BABY STUFF.

19:12.830 --> 19:14.749
I GET IT.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.169
YOU DO?

19:16.170 --> 19:18.749
YES, OF COURSE I DO.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.919
LOOK, WHEN I LOST
MY JOB AT SCANLON,

19:20.920 --> 19:23.169
I KEPT BUYING NECKTIES.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.829
I BOUGHT A WHOLE BUNCH OF
THEM, LIKE THREE DOZEN.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.039
THE REALLY NICE ONES, THE SILK ONES.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.459
I GUESS I JUST, YOU KNOW,
WANTED TO FEEL LIKE I WAS

19:29.460 --> 19:31.080
STILL IN THE GAME.

19:32.670 --> 19:33.919
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

19:33.920 --> 19:35.459
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO JUDGE ME.

19:35.460 --> 19:36.919
WHY WOULD I JUDGE YOU

19:36.920 --> 19:38.249
FOR BUYING A BUNCH OF BABY TOYS

19:38.250 --> 19:39.790
AND SMUGGLING THEM
INTO THE HOUSE?

19:41.830 --> 19:43.080
I UNDERSTAND.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.829
DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY FAVORITE?

19:45.830 --> 19:47.830
ABSOLUTELY.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.249
IT'S A BABY BUSINESS SUIT.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.789
OH!

19:51.790 --> 19:54.119
WHAT? WITH A BRIEFCASE
AND EVERYTHING?

19:54.120 --> 19:55.289
- IT'S A RATTLE.
- IT'S A...

19:55.290 --> 19:56.619
- (rattles)
- HEY!

19:56.620 --> 19:58.749
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE
PERFECT FOR MY KID.

19:58.750 --> 19:59.789
I MEAN, OUR KID.

19:59.790 --> 20:00.919
I'M TELLING YOU
SOMETHING, HONEY,

20:00.920 --> 20:02.829
HE'S GONNA BE A CEO
BY THE TIME HE'S 12.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.710
MMM. YES, SHE WILL.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.879
I CAN'T BELIEVE RYDER'S ACTUALLY
LEAVING TO JOIN THE NAVY.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.919
YOU KNOW,

20:18.920 --> 20:21.209
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE SOME OF HIS
FAVORITE FOOD TO TAKE WITH HIM!

20:21.210 --> 20:23.829
I KNOW, EXCEPT I THINK THE NAVY
ONLY LETS YOU BRING LASAGNA

20:23.830 --> 20:25.460
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH
FOR EVERYBODY.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.079
HEY, HEY. COME ON. BUCK UP, NOW.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.879
ALL RIGHT? LOOK, NO GUY
LIKES TO SEE CRYING

20:30.880 --> 20:32.670
WHEN HE'S ABOUT TO START A
NEW CHAPTER IN HIS LIFE.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.789
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
THIS IS IT, HUH?

20:40.790 --> 20:42.919
ANCHORS AWAY.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.749
WELL, I'LL DRIVE HIM TO
THE RECRUITING STATION.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.289
THAT WAY AUNT MEL WON'T
EMBARRASS AMERICA.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.079
NO, NO, I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.789
WE ARE ALL SO PROUD
OF YOU, RYDER.

20:52.790 --> 20:53.959
RIGHT JOE?

20:53.960 --> 20:55.539
ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY ARE, MAN.

20:55.540 --> 20:56.829
LOOK, WE DID SOME
GREAT WORK TOGETHER

20:56.830 --> 20:59.249
AND, YOU KNOW... I
THINK YOU'RE READY

20:59.250 --> 21:00.749
BECAUSE... WELL, I
KNOW YOU'RE READY.

21:00.750 --> 21:04.919
BECAUSE... YOU KNOW, IT'S...
IT'S THE...

21:04.920 --> 21:06.960
(cries) GOODBYE.

21:08.420 --> 21:11.829
AW, JOE, NOW YOU
GOT ME ALL UPSET.

21:11.830 --> 21:12.959
HEY, LISTEN, I'LL SEE YOU ALL

21:12.960 --> 21:14.209
IN A COUPLE MONTHS.

21:14.210 --> 21:15.999
THAT'S RIGHT, IT BETTER NOT
BE A COUPLE OF DAYS, BUDDY.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.209
- NO, NO IT WON'T.
- I KNOW IT WON'T.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.249
YEAH.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.419
'CAUSE I TAUGHT YOU SO GOOD.

21:19.420 --> 21:20.710
OKAY.

21:22.210 --> 21:23.210
(Lennox and Mel weep)
