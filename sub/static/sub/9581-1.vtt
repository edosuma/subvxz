17:27.480 --> 17:29.540

You can cycle through
the entire population in a year

if you look at 1,906 faces every night,
so that's what I did.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.841
For a year?

17:42.280 --> 17:43.725
For 13 years.

Started the day I left here.

17:48.280 --> 17:51.727

is different, and the eyes.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.922
RAY: You know, must've had surgery.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.940
Makes sense, given what he did,
and contact lenses.

Oh.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.540
She didn't tell me what
she was doing this morning,

19:05.640 --> 19:08.700

about her morning

at lunchtime.

it would just be me and him
in an alley. This is...

an actual case against him.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.609
- Well, maybe he confesses.
- Would you?

19:40.880 --> 19:44.220
(CLEARS THROAT) Maybe we could
go about this a little less officially.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.820
I could call the parole officer...

19:45.920 --> 19:49.726
No, no, no. If we did this,
you couldn't be involved.

Can I give you some...

28:23.200 --> 28:25.806
Just unsolicited advice,
one cop to another?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.980
You're kind of crossing a line here.

the case over at Homicide.

to fight terrorism.

to the hottest mosque in L.A.

I'm not fighting terrorism?

you an ass-kicking.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.804
Why don't you spare yourself?

28:56.960 --> 28:59.611
- Okay?
- Spare myself. Right.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.888
God damn it, I knew
I'd seen that guy before!

29:08.160 --> 29:09.924
He's from the mosque!

29:14.920 --> 29:17.048
(SIGHS) God, I hope
you're wrong about this.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.888
The idea that it could've been
someone connected to this office?

29:22.120 --> 29:23.360
I don't think I could live with that.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.980
Who's the lead on this at LAPD?

29:26.080 --> 29:27.540
Um, a detective named Guerrero.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.700
Has he seen these?

29:28.800 --> 29:32.327
No. No, I thought it might
reflect badly on the office,

29:33.160 --> 29:35.340
the guy being at the picnic, so...

29:35.440 --> 29:36.805
I wanted to show them to you first.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.490
Thank you. I appreciate it.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.300
All right.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.940
Leave all this with me,
get back to your C-T work.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.180
I'll get this Guerrero up to speed.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.300
No, I can take care of that.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.651
No, no. Nothing should ever come
before your terrorism cases. Ever.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.860
Well, it's not a problem for me, sir,
to put out a field report.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.500
No, I can explain things to him, you know?

29:55.600 --> 29:57.204
One vato to another.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.500
Well, the thing is, sir, because
it's Jess, I wanna bird-dog this one.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.682
They teach you some version of "Yes, sir"
at the Bureau, don't they?

30:13.080 --> 30:14.081
Yes, sir.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.567
So?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.321
Be careful in there. He's slick.

30:28.800 --> 30:32.362
And unless I'm very wrong,
he's about to ask you to lunch.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.300
Mean a lot to me if you said no.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.447
How's Jess?

30:38.560 --> 30:39.900
Did you find anything yet?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.380
I did.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.529
Aban Ghazala, the guy seen
running from the garage.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.400
He'd been living down there.
Just confessed.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.201
Where is he?

30:49.800 --> 30:50.881

30:56.480 --> 30:58.209
Come on in, Claire.

Are you hungry?

31:14.880 --> 31:17.500
Hey. I wasn't here today, okay?

31:17.600 --> 31:19.500
We're trying to assess him
as a C-T source.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.020
We gotta keep it quiet.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.531

31:45.080 --> 31:47.060
You really are a dumb
son of a bitch, Siefert!

31:47.160 --> 31:48.900
Is that how cases get buried 'round here?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.340
You find the nearest Muslim
and you ring him up!

31:51.440 --> 31:54.140
You're protecting someone, Siefert,
and you're gonna tell me who it is!

(CLEARS THROAT)

32:13.560 --> 32:16.370
I was just trying to point you
away from someone.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.480
That guy in that stupid picture of yours?

32:20.240 --> 32:22.500
I can't have you questioning
him at the moment.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.284
Why is that? Who is he?

32:25.400 --> 32:26.561
My snitch.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.767
Huh?

32:27.880 --> 32:30.884
My guy in the Al-Ankara mosque.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.883
The guy staring at Carolyn Cobb

32:34.800 --> 32:35.820
is your snitch?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.420
I don't think he's your doer, Kasten.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.100
Well, why don't you introduce us?
I'll ask him.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.170
'Cause he is this close to giving us
a whole sleeper cell!

32:43.120 --> 32:44.360
You don't spook a guy like that!

32:44.480 --> 32:45.940
What the hell you bring him
to the picnic for?

32:46.040 --> 32:47.020
He's a wanna-be, all right?

32:47.120 --> 32:49.248
The guy's got some fantasy
of being a cop someday!

32:50.000 --> 32:52.500
So I brought him to the picnic,
I let him feel like a big-shot.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.647
Anything to keep him happy.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.740
Well, it worked.
He found his true love there!

32:55.840 --> 32:57.180
You don't... You don't know that.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.620
I do know that you tricked
a phony confession

32:58.720 --> 33:00.580
out of a guy who didn't do it!
I do know that!

33:00.680 --> 33:02.921
My guy shuts down, everybody loses!

33:03.800 --> 33:05.723
A couple more buildings come down maybe.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.367
So I redirected things a bit.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.651
Sorry.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.290
He got a name?

33:18.160 --> 33:21.050
You want me to send
Jess in here to ask you?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.769
Anzor Marzin.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.446
- Street name's Pac-Man.
- Where is he?

33:34.960 --> 33:37.260
- Where is he?
- Hey, I don't know, okay?

33:37.360 --> 33:39.249
Maybe you can find him.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.010
Okay.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.250
When's the last time you seen him?

33:51.480 --> 33:53.050
Ten days.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.168
Carolyn Cobb was killed 10 days ago.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.443
Was that a coincidence?

33:58.640 --> 34:01.851
Detective on the case, Guerrero,
he know about all this?

34:03.920 --> 34:05.020
Of course he does.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.009
Guy understands the ugly truth.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.500
Meaning what?

34:08.600 --> 34:12.739

his love life doesn't matter.

All right, start writing.

something useful.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.940
- She's coming out.
- Yeah, right.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.020
And then Marzin's gonna
pull up in a stolen gray van

34:44.120 --> 34:46.699
with Carolyn's DNA under his nails,
and everybody wins.

to do this right.

the line, we're burying it.

What else he say?

39:42.600 --> 39:43.740

two weeks after release,

39:50.840 --> 39:52.540

you know, like drawing,

No and no.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.380

Your Beckwith.

Wasn't much of a surprise.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.900
Why?

41:10.000 --> 41:12.060
And the P.O. doesn't recall Beckwith

41:12.160 --> 41:14.380
having a particular talent
for drawing, does he?

41:14.480 --> 41:16.164
His name's Marzin.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.721
Not Beckwith.

it's not gonna be like last time.

We find the guy, he goes down.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.220
You shouldn't make promises like that.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.820
I can make that promise.

41:40.920 --> 41:44.020
You know, everybody's asking me,
since you're back,

41:44.120 --> 41:45.610
"Who is this guy?"

41:46.480 --> 41:49.460
"What is it with his obsession
with your daughter?"

41:49.560 --> 41:52.940
And I say, "Well, he's a friend.
He's a badge."

41:53.040 --> 41:56.820
They say, "Yeah? Then where's
he been the last 13 years?"

41:56.920 --> 41:59.366
I was supposed to meet
Carolyn in that bakery.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.690

42:05.360 --> 42:09.126
She was gonna have a party
for your birthday.

42:10.160 --> 42:13.448
I told her I'd meet her there
and pay for the cake.

42:14.480 --> 42:18.807
Last minute, I begged off,
after she'd already gotten there.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.605
I had...

42:21.920 --> 42:24.002
I had some case work to file.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.081
Two hours later, we found her.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.211
That's where I've been the last 13 years.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.445
What happened to Siefert's face?

42:54.080 --> 42:55.525
Hell if I know.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.609
I was hoping for
a better answer than that.

42:58.720 --> 43:01.660
Well, I don't spend that much time
thinking about Siefert's face.

you and Bumpy yesterday?

you spin your chain like that?

You're making me anxious.

- Oh, yeah? Why is that?
- Because I caught the case.

43:17.880 --> 43:19.689

43:21.200 --> 43:22.300
Of course he did.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.289
- (BANGS TABLE)
- That son of a bitch!

43:25.600 --> 43:28.888
You're being taken, Claire.
Ghazala's not your guy.

43:29.240 --> 43:30.700
You're gonna have to explain that.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.020
There's a snitch.

43:32.120 --> 43:34.580
He's working Al-Ankara mosque.
His name's Marzin.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.820
He's also a person of
interest on Carolyn Cobb.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.220
And, by the way,
everybody's running around,

43:38.320 --> 43:40.260
trying to blow this thing up.
He's the doer!

43:40.360 --> 43:42.860
So Siefert squeezes
a phony confession out of Ghazala

43:42.960 --> 43:45.980
and the snitch stays untouched,
'cause he's working C-T for us.

43:46.080 --> 43:49.140
Now he turns up as the rapist-murderer
of a cop's kid?

43:49.240 --> 43:51.180
No. No, can't be the guy.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.700

has the highest priority.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.962

He's "a" guy.

a predilection for violence?

45:33.800 --> 45:35.020
Okay. All right. Okay.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.340
JESS: The truth and nothing but the truth.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.460
I'm ready.

45:37.560 --> 45:38.540
- JESS: Fear not.
- (CAROLYN GIGGLES)

45:38.640 --> 45:39.687
This is beautiful, by the way. Thank you.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.524
- You're welcome.
- It's beautiful.

45:41.640 --> 45:46.009
Okay. So, are you looking
for a professional type?

45:48.120 --> 45:50.060
- Struggling actress type?
- What?

45:50.160 --> 45:53.060
(LAUGHS) Nurturing schoolteacher type?

45:53.160 --> 45:55.481
I'm... I'm willing to cast
a wide net, so...

45:56.320 --> 45:58.322
- Very wise. Very wise.
- Thank you.

45:58.640 --> 46:01.166
Uh, how about tall, short...

46:01.800 --> 46:03.380
Other? No preference?

46:03.480 --> 46:05.820
There's no preference,
as long as she's smart.

46:05.920 --> 46:06.967
How smart?

46:07.680 --> 46:09.300
Preferably Harvard-educated.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.420
Oh, okay.

46:10.520 --> 46:11.521
From Philly.

46:11.640 --> 46:12.780
- (CHUCKLES)
- Hmm.

46:12.880 --> 46:13.927
Who's a prosecutor.

46:14.040 --> 46:15.451
- CAROLYN: I see.
- (CHUCKLING)

46:16.000 --> 46:17.140
Named Claire.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.580
(LAUGHING)

46:18.680 --> 46:20.540
CAROLYN: That might narrow
the field a bit, Ray.

46:20.640 --> 46:23.260
That's very good. Very good.
What can I say?

46:23.360 --> 46:24.380
What can you say?

46:24.480 --> 46:25.481
(ALL LAUGHING)

46:27.520 --> 46:29.170
You look a little quiet all of a sudden.

46:32.160 --> 46:33.491
Claire.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.526
I think you should know
that I can't rein her in.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.168
She's not gonna stop
till she finds this guy.

46:40.320 --> 46:44.041
You never saw Jess and her kid.
They were inseparable.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.060
(SIGHS)

46:46.160 --> 46:48.891
Yeah. I can imagine.

46:55.200 --> 46:56.770
I know it's messy.

46:57.200 --> 47:01.165
I mean, working C-T, but we gotta
find this guy before Jess does, okay?

47:02.280 --> 47:04.931
I'll work it at night, under the radar.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.200
Morales doesn't have to know.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.140
I can't tell you what to do
with your free time.

47:13.240 --> 47:17.086
But my legal advice
would be, find that van.

47:17.600 --> 47:18.931
Thank you.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.650
'Night.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.540
Uh, let me, uh...
Let me walk you to your car.

47:25.640 --> 47:26.780
Oh, you don't have to do that.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.540
No, no, I'd like to, if you don't mind.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.608
Something about garages lately.

47:33.600 --> 47:34.806
CLAIRE: Hmm?

47:35.280 --> 47:36.964
Oh. Um...

47:37.400 --> 47:39.129
Sometime next year.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.608
- Congratulations.
- Oh.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.940
What's he do?

47:45.040 --> 47:47.500
He manages a hedge fund in Philly.

47:47.600 --> 47:49.284
His name is Ellis.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.380
So, what, is he moving here?

47:53.480 --> 47:55.130
That's the plan.

47:55.480 --> 47:56.620
Is that a hard thing to do,

47:56.720 --> 47:59.500
to manage a hedge fund in Philly
when you're living in L.A.?

47:59.600 --> 48:00.806
(CHUCKLES)

48:00.920 --> 48:02.490
Might be.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.940
But he's pretty clever.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.328
I bet he is.
Ellis is a pretty clever name.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.041
And love conquers all, right?

48:12.040 --> 48:13.180
That's me.

48:13.280 --> 48:14.645
(CAR BEEPS)

48:15.920 --> 48:17.365
See you tomorrow.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.921
Jess is lucky to have you, Ray.

48:27.440 --> 48:28.805
You're a good friend.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.842
She'd do the same for me.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.485
She'd do more.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.100
All right, I wanna see the stables.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.690
What the hell for?

49:15.560 --> 49:17.289

I had him, Bump.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.044
That was Marzin.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.009
It's okay. This is Luis.

He says the guy is here
all the time boosting cars.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.447

51:26.360 --> 51:28.220
I... I don't talk to him.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.129
I don't like the way
he looks at the horses.

You got a cell phone, Luis?

51:33.520 --> 51:34.726

you know, walk you to your car again.

Well, you need it more than I do anyway.

I mean, I don't know, but I think you...

53:28.080 --> 53:30.401

Yeah, really sweet, Ray. Come with me.

Uh, would you excuse us, Claire?
Thank you.

53:43.320 --> 53:45.049
Please tell me I've been misinformed.

53:45.400 --> 53:49.220
Please tell me no one from this office
broke into the home of a stripper

53:49.320 --> 53:51.620
to steal a comic book

53:51.720 --> 53:54.980
in some half-assed attempt at making
a case against a prime C-T asset!

53:55.080 --> 53:56.420
There's a case to be made, sir.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.682
With a picture from a picnic as evidence.

53:59.520 --> 54:02.683
And no participation from the actual
cop investigating the case.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.051
This how you do things in New York?

54:05.760 --> 54:07.410
Hmm? No warrant.

54:07.680 --> 54:09.420
You just surveil whomever you wish!

54:09.520 --> 54:12.000
My sense was that your enthusiasm
for the target was low, sir.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.004
I'll tell you what's lower,

54:14.360 --> 54:17.807
my enthusiasm for witnessing another 9/11.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.810
Jesus Christ.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.645
Everybody knows those assholes
wanna hit L.A. next!

54:23.000 --> 54:26.580
Half the families in my neighborhood
are buying duct tape and hazmat suits!

54:26.680 --> 54:28.250
You don't even have
a case against this guy!

54:28.400 --> 54:30.340
You don't have his van,
you don't have shit!

54:30.440 --> 54:31.660
If I did, would you file?

54:31.760 --> 54:34.047
No, I'd let a rapist-murderer go free!

54:34.360 --> 54:35.580
Jess is a friend of mine.

54:35.680 --> 54:38.047
You'd charge him, politics aside?

54:38.240 --> 54:41.420
And while you're doing this, how many
C-T leads are going unpursued?

54:41.520 --> 54:43.460
How many hurdles are you
placing between Marzin

54:43.560 --> 54:46.820
and his ultimate use to us,
which is intel on that mosque!

54:46.920 --> 54:51.100
If I had evidence on him tying him
to Carolyn Cobb, you'd charge him?

54:51.200 --> 54:52.820
- Of course!
- I have your word on that?

54:52.920 --> 54:54.206
Did I just stutter?

54:59.720 --> 55:03.780
And by the way, Harvard Law
doesn't date community college,

55:03.880 --> 55:05.660
so stop hitting on my new hire.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.285
You're embarrassing yourself.

55:10.440 --> 55:14.730

but so ambitious.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.129

55:30.000 --> 55:32.890

looking back more than I do.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.569
I don't have the time for it.

55:36.240 --> 55:38.891
Okay. Let's look forward.

55:39.080 --> 55:40.969
Okay, let's.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.484
I think you should go back to New York.

55:43.600 --> 55:44.540
Why?

55:44.640 --> 55:46.020
Because I don't like where this is going,

55:46.120 --> 55:48.060
and I can't justify it
for a case that isn't there.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.286
Oh, it's there.

55:49.480 --> 55:52.290
I got two broken ribs
from a shovel says it's there.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.490
That was Marzin.

55:54.880 --> 55:55.881
I need two more men.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.442
- What?
- Bumpy's on one leg

55:58.920 --> 56:00.649
and truth is I don't move like I used to.

56:00.760 --> 56:03.180
Come on, Ray, you move
exactly like you used to.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.566
(CHUCKLES)

56:05.280 --> 56:06.486

56:07.280 --> 56:09.169
They don't have to be big men.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.521
Get out.

56:12.280 --> 56:14.521
I mean it. Go home.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.281
I can't.

they have anthrax now...

56:28.800 --> 56:30.020
Bump.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.860
What is it? You said
you had a lead on Marzin.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.420
- We do.
- We?

56:33.520 --> 56:34.851
Come here.

56:48.640 --> 56:49.641
Hey, Jess.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.645
I hate the death penalty.

56:54.960 --> 56:56.166
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

56:56.920 --> 56:59.100
JESS: Death would be
too good for this guy.

56:59.200 --> 57:02.522
A big meal and a shot and a nap.

57:02.680 --> 57:05.650
Let him rot in jail,
live a life full of nothing.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.566
Uh-huh.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.420
What're we doing here, guys?

57:11.520 --> 57:13.124
Waiting for him.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.380
He's been here?

57:16.480 --> 57:17.527
JESS: He will be.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.260
Bumpy and I figured it out.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.980
Jess, you come within a mile
of this guy, we never make a case.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.100
JESS: He can quit his job,
he can change his name,

57:24.200 --> 57:28.125
he can dump his car,
but I will still find him,

57:28.680 --> 57:32.685
'cause there's one thing
you can't change, and it's right here.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.561
Are you drunk?

57:37.280 --> 57:40.284
The Justifier by Pac-Man Marzin.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.601
Page one, first character,

57:43.720 --> 57:46.940
a monster hunter named Alston Sherry.

57:47.040 --> 57:47.980
Bumpy?

57:48.080 --> 57:50.780
BUMPY:
Alston. Could that be Walter Alston,

57:50.880 --> 57:53.500
the winningest manager
in the history of the Dodgers?

57:53.600 --> 57:56.300
He won four World Series titles,
three of them here in L.A.

57:56.400 --> 57:57.731
And Sherry.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.540
Larry Sherry?

57:59.640 --> 58:01.620
The MVP of the '59 World Series.

58:01.720 --> 58:04.166
That's the first championship here in L.A.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.200
Not that it matters,

58:06.320 --> 58:08.482
but he had two wins
and two saves in that series.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.340
Page two, Alston's partner,
named Bulldog O'Malley.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.602
- Bump?
- BUMPY: Walter O'Malley?

58:15.720 --> 58:18.820
The owner who brought the Dodgers
to L.A. from Brooklyn?

58:18.920 --> 58:20.020
Man was a saint.

58:20.120 --> 58:21.980
You seeing a pattern here, Ray?

58:22.080 --> 58:25.260
BUMPY: How about "Bulldog", huh?
Orel "Bulldog" Hershiser?

58:25.360 --> 58:27.900
Star of the last Dodger team
that won a Series, '88?

58:28.000 --> 58:29.020
Before we sucked.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.929
JESS: So, why are we here, Bumpy?

58:31.040 --> 58:34.980
'Cause this is the place
where ex-Dodgers hang out.

58:35.080 --> 58:37.048
And all the crazies know it.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.500
And by the way,

58:40.600 --> 58:45.285
the monster that O'Malley and Sherry
are chasing is orange and black.

58:45.840 --> 58:49.162
You know, the colors worn
by that team up north.

58:49.400 --> 58:51.368
Think I'd have noticed
that a little sooner.

58:51.560 --> 58:53.220
Don't beat yourself up, Bump.

58:53.320 --> 58:54.560
Think Blue.

58:54.760 --> 58:56.125
JESS: See?

58:56.320 --> 58:59.802
Passions are like maps.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.963
Take me, for example.

59:03.480 --> 59:05.244
Carolyn is...

59:07.680 --> 59:09.011
Was

59:10.600 --> 59:13.809
the thing that made me me.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.605
Nothing will ever change that.

59:18.880 --> 59:22.900
Take you, the way you keep
thinking about Claire.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.809
It's a lost cause.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.165
But you don't give up.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.651
Passion always wins.

59:33.160 --> 59:36.482
So I will be here every night from now on.

59:38.480 --> 59:40.244
He'll come here.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.527
That's kind of a long shot.

59:44.360 --> 59:46.522
Crazy. I know.

59:48.320 --> 59:51.500
Sort of like building a whole case

59:51.600 --> 59:54.206
around a picture from an office picnic.

59:57.520 --> 59:59.620
But you look at enough faces,

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.961
you're bound to find
the one you're looking for.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.648
Eventually, right?

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.640

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.085

Onlinger checks the runner,
rocks and deals way outside.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.281
Ball four.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.620
And that fast, Manager Dave McDaniels

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.724
out of the dugout,
on his way to the mound.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.531
We'll see if he's bringing a hook with him.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.460
You know, the 2002 Met bullpen

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.040
has not been particularly impressive.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.769

Sit down!

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.081
I'm looking for my uncle.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.930
Yeah, and I'm trying to watch the game.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.820
You know, after 10 nights of this,
I've really learned something.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.967
Bump.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.291
Ten rows up, seven guys in.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.441
BUMPY: Yeah.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.610
- Yeah, maybe.
- Okay.

with a 6-5 lead in the bottom of the 8th.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.808
get yourself suspended,
sent back to New York?

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.060
We didn't know the guy would run.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.140
It was a baseball game.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.700
We were just there to ask him
a couple of questions,

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.380
- but then he ran!
- Don't do that to me.

What were we supposed to do, let him go?

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.940
Yes. We don't have anything on him.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.041
I want him released.

No! I want him advised of his rights
and released before Morales...

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.740

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.300

when I'm a cop.

You understand your rights.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.001
Yeah.

No.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.048

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.921
Mmm.

I never met her.

It's the office picnic.

your, uh... Your rabbi in here.

Your godfather.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.620
I came to the picnic for 10 minute maybe.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.290
Music was shit.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.570
That... Is that a Glock 9?

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.282
That's standard issue, right?

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.565
Why did you run from us?

and killed her, Pac-Man.

Hmm.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.860
Yeah, that would be smart,

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.300
'cause I don't have enough
heat on me as it is, do I?

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.526
So...

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.480
I think you met her at the picnic,

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.041
convinced yourself that
she was interested in you,

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.980
and then maybe after a couple
of days following her around,

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.100
you went up to her,
declared your undying love,

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.540
and when she told you to piss off,
you raped her and killed her

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.165
and dumped her body in the trash,
doused in bleach.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.566
Mmm.

Okay, you should be thanking me.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.780

He hasn't made any calls.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.482
He has friends here, remember?

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.841
Look, I just need a few more minutes.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.962
No, that won't be necessary.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.979
Mr. Marzin has been a very
good friend to this office.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.420
I thought I made that clear to you.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.249
May I see the file, please?

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.166

You're free to go.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:12.300
We're sorry if we've inconvenienced you.

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:13.460

Carolyn Cobb, 5'7", 130 pounds.
An athlete.

"was of extraordinary physical strength."

You see? We're looking
for a brute, not a kid.

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:35.020
You can't overpower a girl like that

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.487
with two noodles for arms. It's laughable.

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:40.448
And then, of course, there's the bleach.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.562
A clear sign of premeditation.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.484
Your killer knew enough to douse
the victim thoroughly inside and out

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.500
so as to destroy all the DNA evidence.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.921
Now, that takes smarts,
it takes strategic thinking.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.327
What is your level
of education, Mr. Marzin?

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.004
What is it, high school?

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.685
Less than that?

01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.660
