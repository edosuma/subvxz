Now give me a coo.
[groans]

00:38.480 --> 00:41.480
Ollie, when are you gonna
finish bird-watching?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.960
It's time to do
something exciting and fun!

00:44.080 --> 00:47.919
Moon, bird-watching
is exciting and fun... to me!

00:48.080 --> 00:50.400
Besides, I need a special bird picture

00:50.559 --> 00:52.640
for my Bird Scouts' meeting tomorrow.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.320
Oh, yeah? What ya got so far?

00:55.440 --> 00:56.960
So far, just pigeons.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.199
But my dream would be
to get a picture of a quetzal.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.399
-A pretzel?
-No, a quetzal. See?

01:05.600 --> 01:08.560
Then I could earn
my "Rare and Unusual Bird" badge.

01:08.679 --> 01:11.600
Ollie, you're not gonna see
a rare bird like that

01:11.759 --> 01:13.960
out of your window.
So let's go to the park!

01:14.119 --> 01:17.880
You can look for quetzals
and I can swing and slide.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.399
Everybody's happy!

01:19.560 --> 01:21.800
Quetzals don't live in Brooklyn.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.320
We'd have to go somewhere far to see one,

01:24.479 --> 01:26.560
like the Cloud Forest in Costa Rica.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.880
Yes?

01:28.119 --> 01:32.160
And you wouldn't be swinging
or sliding, you'd be zip-lining.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.839
Zip-lining? Cool!

01:34.000 --> 01:35.600
[gasps] Ollie! I'm...

01:35.759 --> 01:39.000
-Having a brainstorm?
-How do you know?

01:39.160 --> 01:43.080
We can go on a quetzal adventure
in Costa Rica, with quetzals!

01:43.240 --> 01:44.600
And zip-lining!

01:44.759 --> 01:47.520
But my window is so cosy and safe.

01:47.679 --> 01:49.600
But if you get a picture of a quetzal,

01:49.759 --> 01:52.320
your whole bird-scout troop will cheer!

01:52.440 --> 01:54.759
I'll be a birding hero!

01:54.880 --> 01:56.479
-OK! I'm in!
-Yay!

01:56.600 --> 02:00.360
We're zipping off to Costa Rica
for zip-lining!

02:00.520 --> 02:02.119
And quetzals!

02:02.240 --> 02:03.039
Ah!

02:09.079 --> 02:10.280
Whoo!

02:11.280 --> 02:12.640
Whee!

02:22.519 --> 02:27.200
<i>We are now arriving in Costa Rica.</i>

02:31.760 --> 02:36.239
Wow. This forest really does go
on and on and on and on and...

02:36.359 --> 02:39.040
Yes! It's called the Cloud Forest

02:39.200 --> 02:42.359
because the trees are so high
they touch the clouds.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.640
Now, which way to the quetzals?

02:44.799 --> 02:46.600
And which way to the zip-line?

02:46.760 --> 02:51.160
I know where to find both.

02:51.799 --> 02:54.120
Hello? Is someone there?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.480
Hello!

02:56.840 --> 02:59.640
Coming!

02:59.799 --> 03:02.560
I'm Irene.

03:02.679 --> 03:05.840
-I'm a sloth.
-Hi!

03:06.000 --> 03:07.560
I'm Ollie and this is Moon.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.959
Can you help us find a quetzal?

03:09.120 --> 03:10.959
'Cause then we can go zip-lining.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.560
As long as we get there
before the zip-line closes.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.120
You bet!

03:16.239 --> 03:18.120
And on the way,

03:18.280 --> 03:23.519
you can help me find a <i>guaria morada</i>.

03:23.679 --> 03:27.359
This beautiful orchid
is Costa Rica's national flower.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.760
Cool! Well, what are we waiting for?

03:30.160 --> 03:34.119
Quetzal, here we come.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.000
Let's go, go, go!

03:42.679 --> 03:44.239
This is go, go, go?

03:49.440 --> 03:54.320
[yawns]

03:55.000 --> 03:57.560
I like Irene, except she's not fast.

03:57.679 --> 03:59.519
At all. She moves slowly.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.280
-She even yawns slowly!
-Sloths are naturally slow,

04:03.440 --> 04:05.560
like cheetahs are naturally fast.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.519
-It's just who they are.
-Let's find that quetzal.

04:10.679 --> 04:14.280
Off we go, go, go!

04:14.399 --> 04:15.920
Why does she keep saying that?

04:16.079 --> 04:18.599
What she should be saying
is slow, slow, slow!

04:18.719 --> 04:23.640
I know!
Don't you love how safe and careful she is

04:23.760 --> 04:25.760
and how she stops to admire things?

04:25.880 --> 04:27.560
Uh, not really!

04:27.719 --> 04:31.080
The sun's going down
and the zip-line closes at dusk!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.360
Just point the way
and enjoy the ride, Irene!

04:38.520 --> 04:41.240
-I've got this!
-Thanks!

04:41.400 --> 04:44.360
Careful of...

04:44.520 --> 04:46.919
roots.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.200
See, Moon?
There's no point in being in a hurry.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.719
Yes, there is. Zip-lining!

04:52.840 --> 04:55.080
Which closes in less than an hour.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.640
So let's... do this!

04:58.800 --> 05:00.479
[shouts]

05:02.240 --> 05:03.960
Ah!

05:06.640 --> 05:10.400
Why rush, Moon?
Relaxing and looking for a quetzal

05:10.560 --> 05:14.840
-is so much fun!
-It's OK, Moon.

05:14.960 --> 05:20.599
Everyone gets frustrated that I'm so slow.

05:20.719 --> 05:23.960
Sorry, Irene. Take all the time you need.

05:24.080 --> 05:28.680
Hmm. Maybe there's a way
to help you go fast. This way!

05:30.200 --> 05:32.640
[snoring]
Here we are.

05:32.760 --> 05:36.919
-As high as the clouds!
-And still no quetzal.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.919
Hello, tree.

05:41.039 --> 05:46.120
A sloth's most favourite place to be.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.760
OK, Moon, how does being
up in a tree help us go...

05:49.919 --> 05:51.200
fast!

05:52.159 --> 05:54.440
Hey, hey! This is fun!

05:55.039 --> 05:59.880
Ready, Irene? One, two, swing!

06:00.359 --> 06:05.760
-Woo-hoo!
-I've never gone so fast!

06:07.880 --> 06:10.520
-Awesome swing, Moon.
-Thanks, Ollie.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.359
Way to swing, Irene!

06:12.520 --> 06:14.000
Irene?

06:14.159 --> 06:16.800
[sighs] Now where'd she go?

06:17.640 --> 06:21.560
Uh-oh! Sloths camouflage
really well in a tree.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.200
-She's so hard to find.
-Huh?

06:30.359 --> 06:32.640
[snoring]
Follow that snoring!

06:34.280 --> 06:36.000
[both]
Found her!

06:36.359 --> 06:40.120
Soaring through the clouds
is pretty cool, isn't it, Irene?

06:40.280 --> 06:44.159
Sure, but all that swinging

06:44.320 --> 06:46.719
really tires me out.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.599
Oh, no, look at the time!

06:51.080 --> 06:52.840
We may as well give up.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.599
Look on the bright side, Moon.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.840
We've seen a lot of other amazing things

06:57.000 --> 06:58.440
just by going slow.

06:58.560 --> 07:04.560
Amazing things like
my <i>guaria morada </i>flower.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.200
It's beautiful, Irene.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.640
And so is that quetzal!

07:11.760 --> 07:15.000
Both amazing sights at the same time?

07:15.159 --> 07:17.320
My bird-scout troop will be amazed!

07:17.479 --> 07:20.400
I'll be the bestest birder in Brooklyn!

07:21.680 --> 07:24.320
Slow down, Ollie.

07:24.479 --> 07:26.479
Yeah, you're making it nervous.

07:26.599 --> 07:27.640
[squawking]

07:28.280 --> 07:30.239
I want to take a picture,

07:30.400 --> 07:32.680
but my hands are shaking too much.

07:32.840 --> 07:33.799
Here. Let me.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.400
Perfect!

07:46.200 --> 07:48.080
Wow! Thanks, Moon.

07:48.239 --> 07:49.239
Your turn, Irene.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.440
Say, "guaria morada!"

07:51.560 --> 07:55.239
<i>Guaria morada.</i>

07:55.359 --> 07:58.320
You know, if Irene had been any faster,

07:58.479 --> 08:00.080
we would have missed this moment.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.159
Like I'm missing my moment.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.799
The zip-line place closes in five minutes.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.840
What are we waiting for?

08:08.000 --> 08:12.479
You showed me a sloth can go fast,

08:12.640 --> 08:16.359
so let's pour on the speed.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.479
-Really?
-Really!

08:18.640 --> 08:22.239
Yoo-hoo! Zip-lining here we come!

08:51.520 --> 08:53.360
Hi, Mr Zip-Line Operator.

08:53.680 --> 08:57.680
Is there still time to ride
through the Cloud Forest?

08:58.120 --> 09:00.840
If you'd gotten here any sooner,
you'd have been out of luck.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.319
I was late today.
The zip-line is now open!

09:05.600 --> 09:07.319
How lucky is that?

09:07.480 --> 09:11.400
Irene, thank you for being
so, so, so slow.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.439
It's zip-line time!

09:15.560 --> 09:19.079
I dunno about this, Moon.
Looks kind of scary to me.

09:19.199 --> 09:20.400
No way, Ollie!

09:20.520 --> 09:23.600
This is your chance
to be a quetzal and fly!

09:23.720 --> 09:27.520
Watch me! Woo-hoo! Be the quetzal, Ollie!

09:28.199 --> 09:30.480
Phew! Be the quetzal.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.520
Be the quetzal.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.600
Whoo! I'm flying, just like a quetzal!

09:35.240 --> 09:39.319
Here I go, go, go!

09:39.439 --> 09:40.720
Woo-hoo!

09:40.880 --> 09:43.680
Yeah! Awesome ride, Ollie!

09:43.839 --> 09:46.560
What an amazing day in the Cloud Forest.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.680
Thanks to our sloth friend, Irene.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.800
Who will be here soon. Any time.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.839
Whee!

09:57.959 --> 09:58.880
Yeah!

09:59.959 --> 10:04.800
That was so fast.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.600
[embarrassed laugh]

10:08.040 --> 10:09.839
Getting a picture of a quetzal

10:10.040 --> 10:12.480
and a "Rare and Unusual Bird" badge?

10:12.640 --> 10:15.520
Now that is a fun and exciting day.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.400
Don't forget zip-lining
through the Cloud Forest!

10:20.560 --> 10:24.439
But the best part of visiting
Costa Rica was meeting Irene.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.640
She even made me enjoy going slow.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.839
-Hi, Irene!
-<i>Hello!</i>

10:31.000 --> 10:36.400
<i>I got a new job, thanks to you.</i>

10:36.520 --> 10:42.800
<i>Running the world's slowest zip line!</i>

10:42.959 --> 10:46.880
<i>Here we go, go, go.</i>

10:50.680 --> 10:52.720
<i>Whee.</i>

10:52.839 --> 10:55.360
-I'll get the pretzels.
-Good idea.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.959
This could take a while.
