the suspect as a black man,

he was a black man

Alex was really into the whole

11:22.466 --> 11:24.099
Guys' Night thing.

11:24.134 --> 11:25.367
So like every other night?

11:25.402 --> 11:27.335
Well, Sam passed out.

11:27.371 --> 11:29.371
I'm starting to think he's narcoleptic.

11:29.406 --> 11:31.306
And, uh, Alex dropped a bunch

11:31.341 --> 11:33.575
of sad pick-up lines all night, so...

11:33.610 --> 11:35.543
So, yeah, yeah, pretty much.

11:35.579 --> 11:37.345
JOSH: Blue team, blue team, blue team,

11:37.381 --> 11:41.349
let's scrum here today. Let's do this.

11:41.385 --> 11:44.252
Hey man, what's up? What's
up! Hey, how's it going?

11:44.287 --> 11:46.187
So Evan wanted me to start

11:46.223 --> 11:48.289
by giving my man, Alex
here, a little shout-out.

11:48.325 --> 11:50.225
Dude, Evan's legit stoked

11:50.260 --> 11:53.194
about your user-customizable
photo filters app idea.

11:53.230 --> 11:55.597
We could incorporate photo
filters in the eGIFany app.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.299
It's gonna rock the new app so hard.

11:58.335 --> 11:59.534
Thanks, man.

11:59.569 --> 12:01.336
We'll get started refactoring the code

12:01.371 --> 12:03.104
and improve build time

12:03.140 --> 12:04.384
and testing through
a three-week sprint.

12:04.408 --> 12:06.441
JOSH: I love it! Evan's gonna love it!

12:06.476 --> 12:09.210
You guys rock! Get back to work.

12:09.246 --> 12:13.515
Okay, uh, we'll divide between
Sam and Raj the back-end classes.

12:13.550 --> 12:15.216
Mariana, you handle front-end.

12:15.252 --> 12:17.152
All right? Go blue team!

12:17.187 --> 12:18.420
- Ah!
- Yeah boy!

12:18.455 --> 12:19.487
Blue team!

12:21.291 --> 12:23.425
- Hey, Alex?
- Hey, Mari-anne-a.

12:23.460 --> 12:25.560
- Mari-ah-na.
- Oh, sorry.

12:25.595 --> 12:28.229
The customizable filters was my idea.

12:28.265 --> 12:30.298
- You sure?
- Yeah.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.267
I pitched it to you in the voicemail?

12:32.302 --> 12:33.435
During my party?

12:33.470 --> 12:35.203
Huh, you left me a voicemail?

12:35.238 --> 12:36.271
A couple.

12:36.306 --> 12:37.450
That's weird, I didn't get 'em.

12:37.474 --> 12:40.542
Great minds, right Mari-anne-a?

12:42.179 --> 12:43.411
Now let's get back to work.

12:59.325 --> 13:01.225
You know, I wish the press

13:01.260 --> 13:03.360
would use that photo of Jamal,

13:03.396 --> 13:05.162
but I'm not surprised they don't.

13:06.399 --> 13:08.410
Why they got to make him
out to look like a criminal

13:08.434 --> 13:10.267
in every picture when he's the victim?

13:10.303 --> 13:11.647
You're the girl that's been tweeting

13:11.671 --> 13:13.604
about the case all week.

13:13.639 --> 13:16.307
- You got all these people here.
- Some of them.

13:16.342 --> 13:18.575
I mean, people are
good with the retweets,

13:18.611 --> 13:20.244
but showing up...

13:21.681 --> 13:24.214
- that's not so easy.
- I know.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.483
When Jamal first got killed,

13:26.519 --> 13:28.319
people took to the streets.

13:28.354 --> 13:29.520
But it's been five years,

13:29.555 --> 13:31.422
and with a new shooting every month,

13:31.457 --> 13:34.425
people forget by the time
the case gets to court.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.427
If it gets to court.

13:36.462 --> 13:38.495
I won't forget.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.500
Thank you.

13:46.305 --> 13:47.338
(INAUDIBLE)

14:00.686 --> 14:02.386
I can see there's four paladins.

14:02.421 --> 14:04.321
- I see you.
- Why aren't you the dwarf?

14:04.357 --> 14:06.390
- I'm the mage.
- You're, well...

14:06.425 --> 14:08.525
- Why aren't you the dwarf?
- Because I'm a paladin.

14:08.561 --> 14:10.539
RAJ: I'm telling you,
there's four dragons around.

14:10.563 --> 14:11.606
ALEX: Well, no, you hold on...

14:11.630 --> 14:13.497
SAM: Fireball!

14:13.532 --> 14:14.609
ALEX: Can you hold on two sec... ?

14:14.633 --> 14:16.467
Can we actually plan
out something, please?

14:16.502 --> 14:18.302
Well, why are there dragons charging in?

14:18.337 --> 14:19.937

14:45.331 --> 14:47.264
Why didn't you tell
Wilson you wrote the memo?

14:47.299 --> 14:49.299
Because, in spite of what you think,

14:49.335 --> 14:50.479
I'm not a backstabbing bitch.

14:50.503 --> 14:52.302
I don't think that.

14:52.338 --> 14:55.539
Isn't that what your best
friend, Ben, told you?

14:55.574 --> 14:56.707
I couldn't be trusted

14:56.742 --> 14:58.702
because I was born with
a silver spoon up my ass.

15:00.346 --> 15:02.179
That's not exactly how he put it.

15:02.214 --> 15:03.414
(LAUGHING) Oh.

15:07.353 --> 15:08.552
Look...

15:08.587 --> 15:10.621
Ben turned the last clerk against me,

15:10.656 --> 15:13.223
and it would be nice

15:13.259 --> 15:15.159
if we could have each
other's backs, right?

15:16.495 --> 15:17.495
Yeah.

15:18.497 --> 15:20.197
Thanks for having mine.

15:20.232 --> 15:22.466
Well, don't be too grateful.

15:22.501 --> 15:24.468
I wrote a conservative opinion

15:24.503 --> 15:28.205
recommending against the
injunction on purging the 911 calls.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.541
Which is exactly what
I would have written.

15:30.576 --> 15:33.544
- Really?
- I'm not gonna be the counter-clerk.

15:33.579 --> 15:35.690
I'm not gonna be used to knock
down the progressive argument.

15:35.714 --> 15:38.348
I'm only writing from his
perspective from now on.

15:39.485 --> 15:40.485
Makes sense.

15:46.358 --> 15:47.524
Judge wants to see me.

15:50.696 --> 15:53.697
D... did you really accost
Evan in the elevator?

15:55.401 --> 15:56.633
I did not accost him.

15:58.604 --> 15:59.636
Umm...

15:59.672 --> 16:01.171
Excuse me?

16:01.207 --> 16:02.239
Mr. Speck?

16:03.409 --> 16:04.508
I just...

16:04.543 --> 16:06.510
asked him if I could
pitch him a few app ideas.

16:06.545 --> 16:09.346

16:10.549 --> 16:12.516
Look, you have to pay your dues.

16:12.551 --> 16:15.519
Eventually, you will get
your chance to impress Evan.

16:15.554 --> 16:17.621
I already did.

16:17.656 --> 16:20.557
Apparently, he's super stoked
about an idea that I had,

16:20.593 --> 16:23.360
but Alex took credit for it.

16:23.395 --> 16:26.396
At least you had an idea
that was worth stealing.

16:26.432 --> 16:28.398
You gotta be patient.

16:28.434 --> 16:30.200
Work harder than the boys,

16:30.236 --> 16:31.613
and eventually you'll
get noticed for it.

31:21.468 --> 31:23.268
No surprise there. On what basis?

31:23.303 --> 31:25.303
The doctrine of
spoliation should prevent

31:25.339 --> 31:26.616
the destruction of potential evidence.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.541

31:31.345 --> 31:33.123

31:33.147 --> 31:34.424

31:34.448 --> 31:35.492
