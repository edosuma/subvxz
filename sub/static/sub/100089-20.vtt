WEBVTT

00:00.141 --> 00:03.140
Okay, so it happened...
Poppy and Douglas broke up.

00:03.203 --> 00:04.257
Doomsday scenario.

00:04.305 --> 00:06.005
Possibly catastrophic for the group.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.023
I dialed 3-1-1. They were not helpful.

00:08.070 --> 00:09.375
Does anybody know what happened?

00:09.444 --> 00:11.323
Who we mad at? Poppy? Douglas?

00:11.425 --> 00:13.212
A sexy, sexy stranger
yet to be revealed?

00:13.281 --> 00:15.047
Whoa. Easy, Angie. It's no one's fault.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.649
I mean, she wants a baby, he doesn't.

00:16.718 --> 00:18.618
It's too bad, because
I love a mixed baby.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.519
Half old, half young.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.421
That would've been so cute.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.991
How are Rory and the twins handling it?

00:25.093 --> 00:26.106
The kids don't know.

00:26.168 --> 00:27.994
Poppy and Douglas haven't dealt
with their own feelings yet.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.662
They can't help their kids
until they help themselves.

00:29.731 --> 00:31.430
So that's why we're meeting here.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.666
School on a Sunday...
guaranteed kid-free zone.

00:33.735 --> 00:34.867
You know what else is a no-kid zone?

00:34.904 --> 00:35.968
A bar.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.204
- Stop it.
- We should hit up a bar!

00:38.306 --> 00:40.146
You mean like we did yesterday
and the day before?

00:40.209 --> 00:42.108
Yeah, whatever.
We're single, we're drinking!

00:42.176 --> 00:43.442
- You're paying!
- I am.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.444
Damn, Angie, ever since
you broke up with Colin,

00:45.513 --> 00:46.846
y'all been in the groove.

00:46.855 --> 00:48.535
All right, we got to stop.
Our friends are hurting,

00:48.616 --> 00:49.815
and they should not be left alone.

00:49.848 --> 00:50.983
So I say we split up

00:51.085 --> 00:52.585
and collectively be the custom-made bra

00:52.620 --> 00:54.387
that supports our two
wildly different-sized friends.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.322
- I'll take Douglas.
- Not Poppy, your best friend?

00:56.391 --> 00:58.157
That makes more sense.
I just like answering quickly.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.326
All right, Miggy, let's get to Douglas.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.460
He has the emotional intelligence

01:01.529 --> 01:03.095
of a 1950s auto exec,

01:03.164 --> 01:05.464
so we probably won't even notice
anything's wrong with him.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.368
What do you want?

01:12.907 --> 01:15.941
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

01:18.279 --> 01:19.412
Ang, am I doing the right thing?

01:19.514 --> 01:21.047
Yes, of course!

01:21.149 --> 01:22.682
You want a baby up in there.

01:22.784 --> 01:23.983
You gotta do what you gotta do

01:24.085 --> 01:25.284
to put a baby up in there.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.652
I'm sorry I said it that way.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.321
Me too, but okay.

01:28.423 --> 01:29.555
You're right.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.190
I mean, it's not like
if you want another kid,

01:31.292 --> 01:32.658
you can just wait forever.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.127
Bottom line... you're gonna be fine.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.662
I mean, better than fine...
you're gonna be great.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.198
Things might even be too good for you.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.299
You might even end up murdered,

01:40.401 --> 01:42.001
because that's just the way things go.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.170
It's Derek.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.271
He's here to pick up Graham.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.539
They're doing a photo shoot

01:46.641 --> 01:50.543
with Graham's LEGO Star Wars
thingy around LA landmarks.

01:50.645 --> 01:52.778
Yeah, first stop... the star
on the Walk of Fame

01:52.880 --> 01:54.380
where Harrison Ford is buried.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.748
Okay, Ang, you know those stars

01:55.850 --> 01:57.516
aren't where those people
are buried, right?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.719
Also, Harrison Ford is completely alive.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.813
Oh.

02:00.838 --> 02:02.391
All right. Wow. I'm about to meet Derek.

02:02.431 --> 02:03.451
How should I play this?

02:03.491 --> 02:04.590
Full bitch mode?

02:04.692 --> 02:06.359
Polite but cold? Or...

02:06.461 --> 02:08.038
we going to jail tonight?

02:08.125 --> 02:09.662
No, actually, things are pretty good

02:09.764 --> 02:10.863
between me and Derek right now.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.765
He's really stepping it up
as a co-parent.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.266
He's renting a couch,

02:14.369 --> 02:15.701
he's leasing a Honda.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.371
He's, like, really trying.

02:18.473 --> 02:19.939
Ang, you don't have
a crush on Derek, do you?

02:20.041 --> 02:21.273
No. No.

02:21.376 --> 02:23.042
Yeah, so you feel nothing, right?

02:23.144 --> 02:24.577
Nothing.

02:24.679 --> 02:26.612
Hey. I hope it's kosh

02:26.714 --> 02:29.949
that I parked my four-door car
in the driveway.

02:30.051 --> 02:32.284
It's actually five,
if you count the trunk.

02:32.387 --> 02:33.953
Six if you count the gas thingy.

02:34.055 --> 02:35.688
Hi. I'm Poppy...

02:35.790 --> 02:37.556
Angie's best friend,
Godmother to your child.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.125
Yeah, I've wiped his butt,
and you haven't.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.726
Sorry, I couldn't resist. Starting over.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.794
Hi, I'm Poppy.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.262
Poppy, yes, yes.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.398
The little dude has told me
so much about you.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.566
I heard you have a blue shirt!

02:47.668 --> 02:48.901
I mean, you're not wearing it now,

02:49.003 --> 02:50.169
but I still believe him.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.905
Check it! Where are we
taking this bad boy first?

02:53.007 --> 02:55.040
The Hollywood Sign? The Observatory?

02:55.143 --> 02:56.242
The Chaz Dean billbo...

02:56.344 --> 02:59.712
Oh, no!

03:02.450 --> 03:04.417
Nooooo!

03:04.485 --> 03:06.218
My life's work!

03:06.287 --> 03:08.621
Why, God, whyyyyy?!

03:08.689 --> 03:11.877
Oh. That stinks. But you know what?

03:11.971 --> 03:15.828
Everything you're feeling,
channel it to create something new.

03:15.930 --> 03:20.299
Use that... force.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.102
I got it. I got it.

03:23.138 --> 03:24.138
Oh, man.

03:24.172 --> 03:25.971
Man, just you wait!

03:26.073 --> 03:28.007
Aww.

03:28.109 --> 03:29.675
Wow.

03:29.744 --> 03:31.644
That "force" thing was amazing.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.447
- Did you think of that?
- Yeah, I think so.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.936
But the whole
"thinking on the fly" thing,

03:37.006 --> 03:38.045
I learned that from you.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.618
- Nuh-uh.
- Yuh-huh.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.266
- Nuh-uh!
- Yuh-huh!

03:41.291 --> 03:42.098
Nuh-uh.

03:42.123 --> 03:43.189
Yuh-huh.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.324
- Nuh-uh!
- Yuh-huh.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.994
Yuh-huh.

04:00.575 --> 04:01.707
This is wrong, man.

04:01.776 --> 04:03.676
I don't think he wants us here.
We should bounce.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.778
This whole thing
is making my shingles flare up.

04:05.847 --> 04:07.446
Miggy, he needs us.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.581
Trust the expert.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.417
Strong, masculine, but present.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.053
Watch.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.023
Heya, baby boy. Whatcha makin'?

04:18.125 --> 04:19.524
- Breakfast.
- 2:00 p.m. breakfast?

04:19.594 --> 04:21.459
Hell, yeah. Very European.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.995
If you say so.

04:23.064 --> 04:24.330
Listen, I'd like to say

04:24.398 --> 04:25.698
that I appreciate you being here,

04:25.766 --> 04:26.765
but I don't.

04:26.868 --> 04:28.033
Okay?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.853
So let me just be alone, please.

04:29.908 --> 04:31.136
Oh, fo sho, fo sho.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.606
We hear you, and we ain't
gonna be near you.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.975
Come on, Will. Let's go to that
new cream cheese restaurant.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.577
Miggy, we can go to
Schmear's Lookin' At You later.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.112
Douglas, I know this is hard to hear,

04:40.214 --> 04:41.146
but we're not going anywhere.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.148
In fact, we're just gonna stand here

04:43.251 --> 04:45.417
and exude quiet strength
until you're ready to...

04:45.486 --> 04:46.452
Really?

04:49.190 --> 04:50.656
I know you think you want to be alone,

04:50.725 --> 04:51.857
but that's not what you need.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.526
You need your bros.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.593
And they here.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.830
So, come on. Let's. Dive. In.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.966
All right.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.768
Maybe I do need some company today.

05:02.837 --> 05:06.872
I'm gonna go freshen up
and fire up the Norelco,

05:06.941 --> 05:08.040
put on a clean shirt,

05:08.109 --> 05:11.076
and then I'm gonna
come back ready to heal.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.478
Good.

05:12.547 --> 05:14.079
Thank you, guys.

05:15.550 --> 05:16.982
Proud of you.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.952
You see that?

05:20.021 --> 05:21.320
The process works.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.490
Did you just kiss your own shoulder?

05:24.559 --> 05:26.191
I did. You can do it, too, if you want.

05:26.294 --> 05:28.195
You didn't earn it,
but you can do it, too.

05:28.265 --> 05:30.529
Nah, I'm good.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.666
This is shaping up to be
a red-letter day for ol' Coop.

05:33.768 --> 05:37.670
Helping Douglas out, teaching
you how to support a friend...

05:37.772 --> 05:39.138
It's a good day.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.308
It's a really good day.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.576
Yeah, he's driving away.

05:43.678 --> 05:44.677
Mm-hmm.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.979
I mean, ultimately, I'm cool

05:47.048 --> 05:48.314
because it was bound to happen, right?

05:48.416 --> 05:49.615
I mean, Douglas and I are so different.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.684
I can't just keep being sad about this.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.385
I need to move on.
Can't keep looking back.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.588
That's right!
You're like a dog with a cone...

05:55.619 --> 05:57.085
healing without looking back.

05:58.259 --> 06:00.059
Ow, my head.

06:00.161 --> 06:01.327
Oh, my God.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.596
This poor LEGO man's got no face.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.897
Oh.

06:04.966 --> 06:06.231
It's just turned around
the wrong way in his helmet.

06:06.334 --> 06:09.501
Hey, Poppy, I don't mean
to drop any eaves on you,

06:09.570 --> 06:11.470
but is that really
the healthiest perspective?

06:11.539 --> 06:12.705
Excuse me?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.373
Well, I just mean
that the past is a gift,

06:14.475 --> 06:15.608
and it helps us grow.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.611
If you really care about
Douglas, why forget him?

06:18.713 --> 06:20.379
That doesn't feel fair to either of you.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.449
Whoa. Uh, Derek, can we talk?
I'm gonna come down.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.883
- You'll come down?
- Yeah.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.654
Hello. Um, what you just said...

06:28.679 --> 06:29.665
Stupid.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.672
- I'm sorry.
- No.

06:30.697 --> 06:32.024
Uh, it was weirdly wise.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.392
I was kind of into it.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.495
But that's not
what we're doing here, okay?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.664
We're validating, not challenging.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.566
Ohh, so tell her what she wants to hear?

06:40.635 --> 06:41.634
Like an echo chamber?

06:41.702 --> 06:42.935
Yeah, exactly!

06:43.004 --> 06:45.133
Exactly. Exactly.

06:45.134 --> 06:46.148
Exactly.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.406
Yeah.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.674
I don't mean to sound weird,

06:48.743 --> 06:51.110
but you look really nice in
under-dining-room-table light.

06:54.115 --> 06:55.547
Ow! Come back up.

06:55.650 --> 06:57.149
Ooh.

06:57.251 --> 07:00.297
It's weird down there.
Anyway, we got off track.

07:00.388 --> 07:03.211
- Just remember, no regrets.
- Yeah.

07:03.273 --> 07:05.190
- I refuse to feel bad about any of this.
- Yeah.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.298
So what if I didn't give him
a reason for the breakup?

07:07.322 --> 07:09.561
That's right. It is none of his beez...

07:09.664 --> 07:11.063
Wait. What?

07:11.132 --> 07:12.665
You didn't tell Douglas
why you broke up with him?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.566
You didn't say anything
about wanting a baby?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.735
No. I know he doesn't want one,
so what's the point?

07:16.737 --> 07:17.736
And I'm never gonna tell him.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.139
Yes! Silence is golden.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.807
- That's what's up.
- No, wait, no.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.810
That's not what's up.
Poppy, that's not okay.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.979
It's kind of cruel.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.118
Welp, looks like I found 'em all.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.254
Seventeen thousand...

07:37.491 --> 07:39.291
Okay, you were saying? I'm cruel?

07:39.360 --> 07:40.793
How could you leave him
in the dark like that?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.761
I mean, he must be going crazy.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.962
Hey, you're supposed to support me.

07:44.065 --> 07:45.297
Well, I want to,

07:45.399 --> 07:47.599
but I also feel obligated
to give it to you straight.

07:47.702 --> 07:48.967
Okay.

07:49.070 --> 07:52.738
Well, since we're giving it
to each other straight...

07:52.840 --> 07:54.073
you're into Derek.

07:54.175 --> 07:56.809
- W-What? I-I am not.
- Yeah, you are.

07:56.903 --> 07:58.877
He's an adult now. You love it.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.239
You want it. Yeah.

08:00.281 --> 08:01.880
And I'm not just talking
squeezy fun-fun.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.415
I'm talking relationship.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.517
You just wanna spend
a Saturday at Target

08:05.542 --> 08:06.515
picking up essentials.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.624
- What's your evidence, bro?
- Oh, I don't know,

08:08.702 --> 08:11.156
maybe everything you say and do.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.102
Yeah, what about that
"yuh-huh, nuh-uh" stuff?

08:13.194 --> 08:14.293
- Yuh-huh, nuh-uh, yuh-huh, nuh-uh.
- Nuh-uh.

08:14.395 --> 08:16.282
You're giving him
major relationship vibes.

08:16.337 --> 08:18.130
I am not. Do not put vibes in my mouth.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.132
I am just trying to be nice
to the father of my son.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.364
♪ V-I-B-E, you can't even lie to me ♪

08:22.442 --> 08:24.442
♪ You vibin'. What, what? You vibin' ♪

08:25.740 --> 08:27.239
Okay, this is just a little speed bump.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.875
We're gonna find Douglas,
and we're gonna find him alive.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.643
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I-I assumed.

08:31.746 --> 08:33.412
But... But, Will,
he said he wanted to be alone,

08:33.514 --> 08:34.913
and you ignored him, and now he's gone.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.648
Maybe that's a sign
we should just let him be.

08:36.751 --> 08:39.318
That's so crazy.
You're insane right now.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.186
You need to chill out, my man.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.254
Like, in a real way.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.621
Use me as a model.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.058
I'm chill, I'm positive, I'm calm.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.860
You're not calm. You're shaking.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.495
Yeah, that has
nothing to do with Douglas.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.797
I swallowed a Nespresso pod
earlier... a purple one.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.031
Oh, my God. You want me
to take you to the hospital?

08:53.134 --> 08:54.233
I'll let you know.

08:54.335 --> 08:55.834
All right, we need to
find Douglas, okay?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.870
You're him, you're sad. Where do you go?

08:57.972 --> 08:58.937
Mm, uh... uh...

08:59.039 --> 09:00.372
Present-day Douglas or young Dougie?

09:00.474 --> 09:02.841
Douglas today. The Douglas
we've been talking about.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.210
Okay, I'm just saying,
if it was med-school Douglas,

09:05.312 --> 09:07.146
- I'd be at Delky's.
- What's Delky's?

09:07.248 --> 09:09.081
It's a wing place!
It's what you do in Buffalo!

09:09.183 --> 09:10.115
Come on, man!

09:10.217 --> 09:11.550
Me come on? You come on!

09:11.652 --> 09:13.552
We can't leave Douglas
out there walking alone

09:13.654 --> 09:15.016
right after his breakup with Poppy!

09:15.089 --> 09:16.485
His what?

09:18.554 --> 09:20.087
You have such quiet feet.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.571
What are you kids doing here?

09:22.649 --> 09:23.860
You're supposed to be surfing with Tony.

09:23.904 --> 09:25.633
Tony kicked a stingray to death.

09:25.704 --> 09:27.371
Said it was for Steve Irwin.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.273
He's out in the car cooling off.

09:29.313 --> 09:30.974
What did you say about our dad
and Poppy breaking up?

09:31.043 --> 09:32.443
Oh, no, you misheard.

09:32.545 --> 09:33.744
They're shaking it up.

09:33.846 --> 09:34.778
Role play stuff.

09:34.847 --> 09:37.514
Nasty. But safe! But nasty.

09:37.616 --> 09:40.117
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Cool. Cool, cool.

09:40.142 --> 09:41.106
I totally believe that.

09:41.153 --> 09:42.653
Because I'm a three-year-old

09:42.721 --> 09:45.122
with caca in my sleep sack.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.200
Get real!

09:46.225 --> 09:47.424
Just tell us what's going on.

09:47.493 --> 09:48.859
We can handle it.

09:48.961 --> 09:50.394
We just watched Tony avenge the death

09:50.463 --> 09:52.763
of an Australian he didn't even know.

09:52.832 --> 09:54.698
Look, your parents wanted
to tell you themselves,

09:54.800 --> 09:56.333
but, yes, they broke up.

09:56.402 --> 09:58.268
I'm sorry.

09:58.370 --> 09:59.336
Hey, sigh guy.

09:59.405 --> 10:00.838
A lot to process, huh?

10:00.906 --> 10:02.306
You need some stoic male energy?

10:02.374 --> 10:03.874
Nah, miss me with that mess.

10:03.976 --> 10:06.419
- Okay.
- I'm just worried about Douglas.

10:06.445 --> 10:07.611
Poor guy.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.379
He's not equipped to deal
with something like this.

10:09.482 --> 10:10.547
We need to find him.

10:10.616 --> 10:12.516
I've literally been saying
the same thing,

10:12.618 --> 10:13.984
but we have no idea where he went.

10:14.053 --> 10:15.519
- I know where he went.
- You do?

10:15.621 --> 10:18.021
Where? Cigar lounge?
Delta Lounge? Burger Lounge?

10:18.090 --> 10:19.923
We know it's a lounge, but which lounge?

10:20.025 --> 10:22.326
There's only one place
Douglas would go right now.

10:22.394 --> 10:25.896
In times of trouble, he always
turns to a higher power.

10:25.965 --> 10:30.467
I know I haven't talked to you
in a while, big guy,

10:30.536 --> 10:33.670
but I'm here now, and I need you.

10:38.110 --> 10:41.144
I do not want a relationship with Derek!

10:41.247 --> 10:43.680
We mutually put DNA into the same guy,

10:43.705 --> 10:44.758
and I'm happy he's cleaning up his act,

10:44.783 --> 10:45.949
but that's it, case closed.

10:45.974 --> 10:47.061
Uh, case re-opened.

10:47.086 --> 10:48.352
I can always tell when you're lying.

10:48.420 --> 10:50.464
Like when you told me that you
have four pair of yoga pants,

10:50.489 --> 10:52.393
everyone else might believe it,
but I know it's only one.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.955
It's four! They're all
wearing out in the same way

10:54.994 --> 10:56.727
because of a manufacturing defect!

10:56.795 --> 10:58.262
Stop yelling at me on my breakup day!

10:58.364 --> 10:59.396
Oh, is it your breakup day?

10:59.465 --> 11:00.697
Are we gonna celebrate it all month

11:00.766 --> 11:01.932
like we do for your birthday?

11:02.001 --> 11:03.867
- You love my birthday month.
- I do not.

11:03.969 --> 11:06.203
I can't go to a hibachi
restaurant that many times.

11:06.272 --> 11:08.305
- You love hibachi.
- I hate hibachi!

11:08.374 --> 11:10.173
It's confusing,
you have to sit with strangers,

11:10.242 --> 11:11.475
and... and... and the food is bad.

11:11.577 --> 11:13.944
Don't drag hibachi into this, man.

11:14.046 --> 11:15.612
That's 'bachi, dude! 'Bachi!

11:15.664 --> 11:16.713
And you're only saying that

11:16.815 --> 11:17.915
because you know I'm right about Derek.

11:17.940 --> 11:18.944
You know what?

11:18.969 --> 11:21.184
Maybe I do think about
a relationship with Derek.

11:21.253 --> 11:24.054
Maybe there is a world where
I want to watch him eat cereal

11:24.123 --> 11:26.523
and talk about changing the air filter.

11:26.592 --> 11:28.659
Okay? It's confusing.

11:28.761 --> 11:32.102
- Thank you.
- But you owe Douglas an explanation,

11:32.180 --> 11:34.965
and you're just putting it on me
because you know I'm right.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.001
No, you're just making this about me

11:36.035 --> 11:37.077
because you know I'm right.

11:37.102 --> 11:38.569
I'm out.

11:38.637 --> 11:40.637
Also, Derek's been standing behind you

11:40.739 --> 11:42.760
this whole time,
and he heard everything. Bye!

11:47.346 --> 11:49.479
I did hear everything,

11:49.548 --> 11:50.948
but I'm willing to have my mind wiped

11:51.050 --> 11:52.482
if you'll loan me the money.

11:57.256 --> 11:58.522
There's Dad's car!

11:58.591 --> 12:00.857
It's not a car.
It's a gentleman's coupe.

12:00.926 --> 12:02.125
Show some respect.

12:02.194 --> 12:05.028
Wow. I gotta say, I am impressed, Rory.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.630
You really do know Douglas.

12:06.699 --> 12:08.398
See, Miggy? All's well that ends well.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.167
Or should I say, ends Will?

12:10.269 --> 12:11.501
I don't like that, man.

12:11.604 --> 12:13.804
It's true, guys.
I really do know Douglas.

12:13.906 --> 12:16.073
I've really gotten
to know him this past year.

12:16.175 --> 12:18.875
We've become very close.

12:18.978 --> 12:20.077
Which is why it's a shame

12:20.179 --> 12:21.178
that he has broken my mom's heart

12:21.280 --> 12:22.679
and now I must murder him.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.559
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go!
- What?!

12:25.584 --> 12:27.184
- Rory? Rory?
- Go, go! Let's go!

12:27.286 --> 12:29.319
- Murder is fun!
- Move! Move!

12:29.421 --> 12:31.496
Museums are for learning!

12:32.493 --> 12:36.330
Uh, okay. So, did you h-hear
the part where...

12:36.409 --> 12:38.932
I heard all the parts.
Especially the one where you said

12:39.002 --> 12:40.534
you wanted to be
in a relationship with me?

12:40.622 --> 12:41.821
I said maybe.

12:41.889 --> 12:43.389
And I was in a fight
with my best friend.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.625
That's legally the same as being drunk.

12:45.693 --> 12:47.793
You don't have to backpedal. This is...

12:47.895 --> 12:50.096
It's obviously a-a sexy situation...

12:50.198 --> 12:52.231
No, no, no. This is not sexy.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.634
And this is definitely not a situation.

12:54.736 --> 12:58.871
Oh, well, that's a bummer.
Because... the truth is,

12:58.940 --> 13:00.921
I want that, too.

13:00.991 --> 13:02.208
I want to be with you.

13:02.310 --> 13:03.976
What?

13:04.078 --> 13:05.945
- You do?
- I do.

13:06.047 --> 13:08.047
Very much.

13:08.149 --> 13:10.216
Well...

13:10.285 --> 13:12.785
We're just getting into a really
good co-parenting rhythm,

13:12.887 --> 13:14.053
and I... I don't...

13:14.122 --> 13:15.915
I don't want to do anything
that'll risk that.

13:15.993 --> 13:17.757
I know. I totally agree.

13:17.825 --> 13:19.959
But also, what if we just did?

13:20.028 --> 13:22.461
Listen, Graham goes to camp
every summer.

13:22.563 --> 13:24.563
What if you came with me
to Barstow while he's away?

13:24.632 --> 13:26.098
We could figure out what this is.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.434
You could finally get to know Phoebe.

13:28.536 --> 13:29.535
That's my turtle.

13:29.637 --> 13:31.937
Yeah, I know. She sent me a valentine.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.706
That was from me.

13:33.808 --> 13:35.541
Yeah, I figured.

13:35.610 --> 13:37.943
If we don't try, we'll always wonder.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.947
Mom, Derek, look what I made!

13:42.050 --> 13:43.649
I didn't even use instructions.

13:43.751 --> 13:45.017
But it looks great, right?

13:45.086 --> 13:47.019
That makes me want to be a real LEGO man

13:47.121 --> 13:48.387
so I can fly it.

13:48.456 --> 13:50.256
You see... you see these orange ones?

13:50.325 --> 13:53.592
Basically, this thing here,
this is actually laser-proof.

13:53.695 --> 13:54.860
- Laser-proof?
- Yeah.

13:54.962 --> 13:57.930
- And, um, right in here...
- Yeah?

13:57.999 --> 14:00.166
This is where they eat snacks.

14:00.234 --> 14:02.268
- Oh, that's a snack hole?
- Yeah.

14:02.337 --> 14:05.271
I keep replaying it and replaying it,

14:05.340 --> 14:07.006
and I don't understand it, Dutch.

14:07.075 --> 14:09.809
She was supposed to be my Nancy.

14:09.877 --> 14:11.744
Hello, Douglas.

14:11.813 --> 14:13.546
Rory, what are you doing here?

14:13.648 --> 14:14.680
I have come to murder you.

14:14.782 --> 14:16.549
And that would go down how?

14:16.651 --> 14:20.119
I mean, I figured I could
find something to throw at you.

14:20.221 --> 14:21.328
Maybe a sword.

14:21.406 --> 14:23.171
Feel like a lot of museums have swords.

14:24.325 --> 14:25.691
I don't know. I'm just mad at you.

14:25.793 --> 14:27.326
Well, I'm mad at me, too.

14:27.395 --> 14:29.395
Your mom was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me,

14:29.464 --> 14:30.863
and... and I blew it.

14:30.932 --> 14:32.431
Then she broke up with me.

14:32.533 --> 14:36.001
Wait. She broke up with you?

14:36.070 --> 14:37.703
- Why?
- I-I don't know.

14:37.805 --> 14:38.771
She never told me.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.506
But you know your mom...
she's a smart woman,

14:40.608 --> 14:43.542
so she must have had a good reason.

14:45.012 --> 14:47.113
Well, this sucks.

14:47.181 --> 14:48.914
You know, I didn't like you
for a long time.

14:49.016 --> 14:51.417
- Same.
- Mm.

14:51.486 --> 14:53.586
But now I do.

14:53.688 --> 14:54.820
Same.

14:54.889 --> 14:57.189
So, we came all this way,

14:57.291 --> 14:59.525
and now, just like that,
you're out of my life?

14:59.627 --> 15:01.260
Hey, Rory,

15:01.329 --> 15:03.496
I will never be out of your life.

15:03.564 --> 15:05.364
Okay? Look at me. Look at me!

15:05.466 --> 15:07.166
- I'm looking straight at you.
- I know.

15:07.235 --> 15:09.668
It just sounded like
the right thing to say.

15:09.737 --> 15:12.438
Listen, whatever happens
between me and your mom

15:12.507 --> 15:14.807
won't change how I feel about you.

15:14.909 --> 15:17.710
You will always be a part of my life.

15:17.812 --> 15:20.559
And I'm always here for you. Okay?

15:26.320 --> 15:27.420
- Mm. Mnh. Nope.
- Yeah.

15:27.488 --> 15:28.654
All right, let's never
talk about that again.

15:28.756 --> 15:31.424
- Talk about what?
- Nice.

15:31.526 --> 15:32.792
Look, you're not a quitter.

15:32.894 --> 15:35.694
If you want to get Poppy back,
you gotta at least try.

15:38.599 --> 15:41.901
Scale of one to ten,
how racist was that fella?

15:42.003 --> 15:43.569
I'm done with you now.

15:46.908 --> 15:48.741
Excuse me, sir, our friend went in there

15:48.843 --> 15:49.942
to "kill" our other friend,

15:50.011 --> 15:51.177
and we have to get in to stop it.

15:51.245 --> 15:52.411
Do you have a reservation?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.313
You need a reservation
for the Ronnie Room?

15:54.415 --> 15:57.349
This is more government control
than the Gipper would've wanted.

15:57.452 --> 15:59.118
And you know that.

15:59.187 --> 16:00.786
Come on. Let's go touch some stuff.

16:00.855 --> 16:02.788
Okay, you were right.

16:02.890 --> 16:05.257
Clearly Douglas doesn't want us
anywhere near him.

16:05.326 --> 16:06.492
This is such a mess.

16:06.561 --> 16:07.993
This is why friends
shouldn't date within the group.

16:08.062 --> 16:10.663
It's too risky.
That's why I would never do it.

16:10.765 --> 16:12.064
Uh...

16:12.166 --> 16:13.232
I'm gonna say disagree.

16:13.301 --> 16:15.401
I got mad respect for Poppy and Douglas.

16:15.470 --> 16:16.969
They had the guts to take a shot.

16:17.038 --> 16:18.471
The only thing worse than a breakup

16:18.573 --> 16:20.339
is letting those feelings eat you up.

16:20.441 --> 16:22.408
I could never do that.

16:22.510 --> 16:23.909
Could you?

16:32.220 --> 16:34.220
Okay! Gonna go check out some T-Rexes.

16:34.322 --> 16:37.056
Um, different kind of museum, buddy.

16:37.124 --> 16:38.424
Nah, I'll find 'em.

16:44.232 --> 16:45.598
Ding dong.

16:45.666 --> 16:47.366
I'm sorry.

16:47.468 --> 16:48.767
Look...

16:50.171 --> 16:51.528
...you were right, all right?

16:51.606 --> 16:54.240
I may have some
unresolved feelings for Derek.

16:54.308 --> 16:55.508
And he told me he does, too.

16:55.610 --> 16:58.177
- What? He said that?
- Later. Save that for later.

16:58.254 --> 16:59.545
All right.

16:59.647 --> 17:00.813
I didn't want to hear the truth,

17:00.882 --> 17:03.949
but... you're a good friend
for telling me anyway.

17:04.050 --> 17:05.483
You are, too.

17:05.586 --> 17:07.219
I know. I need to talk to Douglas.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.521
I just... I don't know where to start.

17:08.623 --> 17:10.923
You know him better than anyone.

17:10.992 --> 17:13.025
And just... talk.

17:13.127 --> 17:14.527
Even if it's tough.

17:14.628 --> 17:16.228
Like a piece of hibachi steak.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.998
Okay, you go for the experience.

17:21.002 --> 17:24.869
And you were right about my yoga pants.

17:24.939 --> 17:26.238
It is only one pair.

17:26.307 --> 17:29.241
I know, baby. I know.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.415
That coffee for me?

17:36.517 --> 17:38.751
Yes. They... they wrote "Poopy" on it.

17:38.853 --> 17:40.686
- Oh.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.188
I'm just honestly seeing that
for the first time.

17:43.257 --> 17:45.224
I actually got you a coffee, too.

17:45.293 --> 17:47.126
Guess we were both hoping
we'd run into each other.

17:47.228 --> 17:49.228
- I guess so.
- Should we exchange coffees...

17:49.297 --> 17:52.763
Listen, Pop, I-I could ease into this
with some light banter,

17:52.849 --> 17:55.334
but I-I know what I want... you.

17:55.403 --> 17:57.591
And I'll do whatever it takes
to get you back.

17:57.637 --> 17:59.520
Douglas, I don't think
you can promise that.

17:59.567 --> 18:00.817
Yes, I can.

18:00.895 --> 18:02.875
If you want me to quit my job,
I'll quit my job.

18:02.944 --> 18:05.044
If you want to move
to another city, I will.

18:05.146 --> 18:07.012
Just not Santa Fe. Creeps me out.

18:07.114 --> 18:09.114
O-Okay, Santa Fe.

18:09.216 --> 18:11.083
I'll move to Santa Fe for you.

18:11.152 --> 18:13.152
Douglas, I want to have a baby.

18:14.589 --> 18:15.988
A baby?

18:16.090 --> 18:18.457
Wow. That is, uh...

18:18.559 --> 18:22.494
Like one that takes 18 years to raise?

18:22.597 --> 18:24.263
A-Are you... Oh, okay.

18:24.332 --> 18:26.031
You know... You know what?
Let's... Let's do it.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.166
Let's do the baby.

18:27.268 --> 18:29.602
Come on. You... You don't
want that, do you?

18:29.704 --> 18:30.970
I want us.

18:31.072 --> 18:33.639
I do, too, but I can't let you
have a baby that you don't want.

18:33.741 --> 18:35.508
That won't make either one of us happy.

18:37.712 --> 18:40.139
Okay, so I guess this is just a...

18:40.202 --> 18:43.983
Horrible, sucky,
unfixable situation. Yeah.

18:44.085 --> 18:47.219
Oh, man. Yeah, that's...
that's the worst kind.

18:47.321 --> 18:49.688
Um...

18:49.790 --> 18:51.156
I'm sorry.

18:51.258 --> 18:52.758
Don't be sorry.

18:54.395 --> 18:55.928
I love you.

18:58.032 --> 18:59.531
I love you, too.

19:02.536 --> 19:04.203
Thanks.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.747
Oh, my God. You were, like, right there.

19:21.797 --> 19:24.059
Yeah, you're an incredibly loud
parallel parker.

19:24.114 --> 19:27.182
And I don't just mean the hubcaps
scraping against the curb,

19:27.250 --> 19:29.551
I mean the swearing,
and the yelling, "Sir!

19:29.653 --> 19:31.586
Can you help me?! Am I close enough?!

19:31.655 --> 19:33.154
I'm not anywhere near the curb?!

19:33.256 --> 19:35.824
Okay, thank you, sir!" And so on.

19:37.094 --> 19:38.626
Do you have a second to talk?

19:38.729 --> 19:41.429
Yeah, you wanna unpack all
the Douglas and Poppy stuff?

19:41.531 --> 19:42.997
Wait, are you sweating?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.199
Are you wearing body spray?

19:44.301 --> 19:45.567
Yes, thank you.

19:45.669 --> 19:48.870
Um, I'm... I'm not here
to talk about them.

19:48.972 --> 19:51.106
Although dealing with their breakup

19:51.208 --> 19:54.109
made me think a lot about friendship,

19:54.211 --> 19:55.977
and... and relationships,

19:56.079 --> 19:59.428
and... complicated things, you know?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.649
And... And...
and I don't know, I just...

20:01.752 --> 20:05.120
I felt like I had to see you.

20:05.145 --> 20:06.188
Is that weird?

20:06.223 --> 20:07.322
No.

20:07.424 --> 20:08.508
I'm glad you're here.

20:08.558 --> 20:09.768
- You are?
- Yeah.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.278
I have been dying to tell you.

20:12.356 --> 20:14.591
Something crazy happened.

20:14.662 --> 20:17.896
Derek asked me to move with him
to Barstow for the summer.

20:17.998 --> 20:19.231
Oh.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.504
I said that I would think about it.

20:20.567 --> 20:24.036
- Oh?
- And as crazy as it sounds, I...

20:25.439 --> 20:27.606
I might do it.

20:27.708 --> 20:30.409
Ohhhh!

20:30.511 --> 20:33.879
That... is crazy!

20:33.981 --> 20:35.013
And you know what?

20:35.115 --> 20:36.882
I'm gonna go.

20:36.984 --> 20:38.677
Where are you going? You just got here.

20:38.755 --> 20:41.114
To the... beach.

20:41.188 --> 20:42.421
It's 9:00 at night.

20:42.513 --> 20:44.184
I know. Smart, right?
Traffic will be light.

20:44.255 --> 20:45.428
Parking's gonna be a dream.

20:45.483 --> 20:47.345
What is going on with you?
Now you're definitely sweating.

20:47.374 --> 20:48.991
Yeah, well, that is another problem

20:49.038 --> 20:50.256
that can be solved at the beach.
