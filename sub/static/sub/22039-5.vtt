WEBVTT

00:04.008 --> 00:07.648
You comfortable? Are you..
are you too hot or too cold or...?

00:10.888 --> 00:13.766
Any coffee? Or you want
some more coffee or anything?

00:13.767 --> 00:16.886
Because there's a place just
up the road. I can go get it.

00:16.887 --> 00:19.166
What are
you asking me right now?

00:19.167 --> 00:22.181
Uh, just... do you feel okay?
You feel... you're comfortable?

00:22.206 --> 00:23.605
Everything okay.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.245
Just making chit-chat.

00:25.246 --> 00:27.885
Are you okay? Do you feel comfortable?

00:28.391 --> 00:29.725
Yeah, I'm very, very comfortable.

00:29.726 --> 00:32.764
So let's just both assume the
other man is okay and comfortable.

00:32.765 --> 00:34.454
Sure. Just... just... just...

00:34.479 --> 00:40.884
You know, I've never had an
American policeman, uh, here.

00:40.885 --> 00:44.403
So it's... it's a little
exciting to have you here.

00:44.404 --> 00:45.883
Welcome!

00:45.884 --> 00:48.203
Car 72,
please report. Car 72.

00:48.204 --> 00:50.883
Uh, yes, uh, Car 72.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.431
That's no activity from
Detective Hendy and...

00:57.163 --> 00:59.477
Uh, Special Agent...
Special Agent? Or is it...?

00:59.502 --> 01:01.602
Uh, Agent Cutler from...

01:01.603 --> 01:03.321
Is it the D... DEA?

01:03.322 --> 01:04.921
Drug...

01:04.922 --> 01:06.962
The American... from America.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.081
You know who he is. No activity.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074

Operation Big Red.

01:41.239 --> 01:43.357
Confirming the amphetamines
within the coffee crates

01:43.358 --> 01:46.277
were moved overnight to
the warehouse location,

01:46.278 --> 01:50.157
uh, suspected of being
a distribution centre.

01:50.158 --> 01:54.356
So do you, uh... You flew
over business or economy?

01:54.357 --> 01:56.076
Or coach?

01:56.077 --> 01:58.336
From the States... of America?

02:02.077 --> 02:03.715
You know, on those long-haul flights,

02:03.716 --> 02:06.355
they put a very mild constipating agent

02:06.356 --> 02:09.155
in the food, you know,
just... just to...

02:09.156 --> 02:12.235
It reduces bowel movements.
It's called corking the food.

02:12.236 --> 02:14.554
You cork the chicken
pasta and cork the...

02:14.555 --> 02:16.594
'Cause otherwise, you've got
300 people at 40,000 feet...

02:16.595 --> 02:18.994
You know, think about it.
It's gonna become a real poo-fest.

02:18.995 --> 02:22.274
And, uh, you know, then
you've got 'Turds on a Plane',

02:22.275 --> 02:25.073
starring Samuel L. Jackson.

02:25.074 --> 02:26.793
It's not because you're
black. That was not...

02:26.794 --> 02:29.153
It's just because he's the star
of the movie. He's... he's...

02:29.154 --> 02:31.793
Sorry, and I know you have to be
very sensitive about that thing

02:31.794 --> 02:33.272
in your country

02:33.273 --> 02:35.312
because you shoot the
black... you shoot the people.

02:35.313 --> 02:38.232
You shoot people of
various, um, ethnic...

02:38.233 --> 02:40.032
All sorts. All sorts.

02:40.033 --> 02:42.951
Sorry, I'm just... I'm rambling
because my partner shot someone.

02:42.952 --> 02:45.791
He's in counselling because
he shot a black... a person...

02:45.792 --> 02:48.911
Can we be in silence for just a moment?

02:49.523 --> 02:52.203
- Is that okay? Thank you.
- Yes.

02:59.071 --> 03:01.830
So do I... do I just
start talking or...?

03:02.436 --> 03:04.189
Well, if you could just, uh,

03:04.190 --> 03:07.549
tell me about the night of
the shooting in your own words.

03:07.550 --> 03:11.109
Ah, the shooting. Well, okay.

03:11.110 --> 03:13.668
Just to go back, to put
it into context, all right?

03:13.669 --> 03:15.627
Hendy and I, uh, uh...

03:15.652 --> 03:17.268
Well, actually, go back another step.

03:17.269 --> 03:18.748
I'd left home in the morning.

03:18.749 --> 03:20.415
Um, my wife, Wendy, uh, was...

03:20.440 --> 03:22.039
I was a bit late out the door

03:22.064 --> 03:23.427
because she was in one of her moods.

03:23.428 --> 03:25.187
She gets a...

03:25.188 --> 03:27.147
Well, she's kind of
clinically depressed,

03:27.480 --> 03:30.279
but, um, she has been
ever since her husband...

03:30.304 --> 03:31.747
No... no one probably...

03:31.748 --> 03:35.066
Anyway, she was married
to a pilot, uh, Charles.

03:35.067 --> 03:38.586
And, um, he suffered a
rather unfortunate accident

03:38.587 --> 03:40.386
with a... with a cargo door.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.025
Actually, I won't go
into the details. It's...

03:43.026 --> 03:45.225
He lost his head. It came, like...

03:45.226 --> 03:47.265
It just... as he was going by...

03:47.266 --> 03:49.505
Apparently, he was reaching
in for some hand luggage.

03:49.506 --> 03:51.025
Anyway, it wasn't his. Doesn't matter.

03:51.026 --> 03:52.505
Hendy and I had to go around

03:52.506 --> 03:54.144
and give her the news about her husband,

03:54.145 --> 03:56.624
and she was distraught, quite naturally.

03:56.625 --> 03:59.544
So, uh... He was a very handsome man.

03:59.545 --> 04:02.743
And he had this, um... like, this hat.

04:02.744 --> 04:06.104
He would wear his hat
on a jaunty angle and...

04:07.584 --> 04:10.103
I understand her grief,
is all I'm trying to say.

04:10.104 --> 04:11.583
And we struck up a little thing.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.462
And one day, she just
threw herself at me.

04:13.463 --> 04:14.942
Like, out of grief,

04:14.943 --> 04:17.702
she just came at me
like some nympho octopus,

04:17.702 --> 04:19.341
just legs all over the place.

04:20.041 --> 04:24.181
It was amazing, but she was
quite ashamed afterwards.

04:24.182 --> 04:26.341
Do you think we could just get back to

04:26.342 --> 04:27.821
the night of the shooting?

04:28.598 --> 04:30.661
Ah, the shooting, yes!

04:30.662 --> 04:32.261
What do you want to know about that?

04:42.214 --> 04:45.459
Hey, mate, have you
thought any more about...

04:45.460 --> 04:47.259
maybe coming down the coast with me?

04:47.260 --> 04:49.019
You know, I'll look after you.

04:49.514 --> 04:50.819
Yeah.

04:50.820 --> 04:55.178
Hey, hey, don't worry, all right?
We'll be all right. I promise.

04:55.179 --> 04:57.218
I got rid of him clean,
mate. No one's gonna...

04:57.219 --> 04:59.938
As long as we keep our
mouths shut, we'll be fine.

04:59.939 --> 05:02.150
Should I teach you something
while we're here?

05:02.175 --> 05:03.175
Yeah.

05:04.018 --> 05:06.177
You just got a little
bit of blood there.

05:06.928 --> 05:08.937
This is a little app I picked up.

05:08.938 --> 05:10.937
That one down there, that's your C4.

05:10.938 --> 05:13.416
Most blokes, if they're
gonna take a head off,

05:13.417 --> 05:16.216
they'll just drive an
axe between the C4 or C5.

05:16.217 --> 05:18.216
They're gonna make a mess
all over the place, right?

05:18.217 --> 05:20.016
You get shards of bone.

05:20.017 --> 05:24.055
Mate, that is a forensic
man's wet dream, right? Not me.

05:24.056 --> 05:25.535
Have a look at this.

05:25.536 --> 05:28.015
Or would you use a crowbar
or, like, a hacksaw to get...

05:28.016 --> 05:32.295
No! Amateur time, mate.
Amateur time. No. Piece of wood.

05:32.296 --> 05:34.534
In fact, even better,
a little bit of cloth around it,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.214
and just gently,
ever-so-gently, until...

05:36.215 --> 05:38.054
You'll feel it, you'll
feel it, you'll feel it...

05:38.055 --> 05:40.174
Straight off.

05:40.175 --> 05:42.733
Clean as a whistle.
No shard. No problem.

05:42.734 --> 05:44.213
This is providing, of course,

05:44.214 --> 05:46.973
you've done all your nerve
work, your muscle work around it.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.201
- Which I generally do straightaway.
- Yeah, right.

05:49.496 --> 05:52.976
You know, I probably...

05:53.613 --> 05:55.132
I think about if Mum and Dad

05:55.133 --> 05:57.012
had probably paid more attention to me,

05:57.013 --> 06:00.012
I probably could've
got a decent education.

06:00.013 --> 06:02.452
I probably could've
been a doctor, you know?

06:02.453 --> 06:03.971
You've got an incredible bedside manner.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.211
Very steady hand. A keen eye.

06:06.212 --> 06:07.771
I love the idea of helping people.

06:07.772 --> 06:09.611
Just making them feel better, you know?

06:09.612 --> 06:12.291
You are helping people.
You're helping me.

06:12.292 --> 06:14.930
And goodness knows Glen
feels a lot better now...

06:14.931 --> 06:17.250
wherever he is.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.490
Right, in a thousand bits
and pieces all over the place.

06:19.491 --> 06:21.210
Exactly right. Never-never land.

06:21.211 --> 06:22.689
You know?

06:22.690 --> 06:24.169
Woop-woop.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.249
Wonderworld.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.256
Madagascar.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.489
Madagascar's a real place.

06:32.490 --> 06:34.288
Isn't it? In Africa.

06:34.289 --> 06:36.009
Don't think so. I think it's a cartoon.

06:42.715 --> 06:45.423
- It's your first time here?
- Yeah.

06:46.342 --> 06:47.941
Have you seen much?

06:47.942 --> 06:49.949
I don't think there's much to see.

06:49.949 --> 06:52.108
Come on! It's Australia.

06:52.109 --> 06:53.827
I mean, I know a lot about Australia.

06:53.828 --> 06:56.667
I could take you to the zoo.
Have you seen many marsupials?

06:56.668 --> 06:59.907
- We've got, uh, emu. Platypus.
- Right.

06:59.908 --> 07:01.627
When they first discovered the platypus,

07:01.628 --> 07:03.386
they thought it was a fake, a forgery.

07:03.387 --> 07:05.506
I could take you to some
kangaroos in the wild.

07:05.507 --> 07:07.106
Yeah, I've seen "Crocodile Dundee".

07:07.107 --> 07:11.186
I know what you guys have to offer.
I've seen it. I love it.

07:11.187 --> 07:13.505
I've seen your nature.
I've seen your people.

07:13.506 --> 07:15.585
Well, if you've just
seen the movie, that's...

07:15.586 --> 07:17.625
"Crocodile Dundee", that's 30 years ago.

07:17.626 --> 07:20.185
You know, we've done a...
come a long way since then.

07:20.186 --> 07:21.665
You're telling me you've got

07:21.666 --> 07:23.144
something better than
"Crocodile Dundee"?

07:23.145 --> 07:25.664
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

07:25.665 --> 07:27.384
I think it's insulting to be told

07:27.385 --> 07:29.704
that that's the best thing
our country's done in 30 years.

07:29.705 --> 07:31.544
- Name something better.
- I can name plenty of things.

07:31.545 --> 07:33.143
- Name one.
- I can name lots of things.

07:33.144 --> 07:34.983
- Then start naming them.
- I will.

07:34.984 --> 07:37.097
- And I'll give you an honest take.
- Okay.

07:37.264 --> 07:39.023
For one...

07:39.024 --> 07:40.503
I don't know what "For One" is.

07:40.504 --> 07:42.103
- No, I'm saying number one.
- "For One"?

07:42.104 --> 07:44.222
- Number one.
- 'Cause you took a pause.

07:44.223 --> 07:46.382
Yeah, I'm thinking of the best thing.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.862
'Cause I can say one without thinking.

07:47.863 --> 07:50.702
"Crocodile motherfucking Dundee".

07:50.703 --> 07:52.302
- The Sydney Olympics.
- No.

07:52.303 --> 07:54.301
Everyone does an Olympics.
Every four years, it's different.

07:54.302 --> 07:56.781
- We hosted those Olympics.
- Yeah, and we won those.

07:56.782 --> 07:59.901
- We've hosted them in L.A. too.
- Ian Thorpe.

07:59.902 --> 08:03.060
- Lleyton Hewitt. Vegemite.
- No. Eugh! No, no, no.

08:03.061 --> 08:05.500
- Pavlova. Great Barrier Reef.
- No. No.

08:05.501 --> 08:08.020
- Uluru. Bondi.
- No. No.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.901
"Australia", the film.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.940
"Crocodile Dundee II".

08:20.140 --> 08:22.219
- You win.
- There you go.

08:22.220 --> 08:25.018
- And that's all I'm saying.
- Yeah. Okay.

08:25.019 --> 08:27.618
No movement
to or from the warehouse

08:27.619 --> 08:29.098
at this time.

08:29.099 --> 08:32.457
Uh, let's stay alert, guys.
We know the target's good.

08:32.458 --> 08:34.697
Just, uh... just gotta wait.

08:34.698 --> 08:36.496
- That is amazing.
- What is?

08:36.498 --> 08:39.657
Listen to this, "More fatalities occur"

08:39.658 --> 08:42.496
"from cyclones and
hurricanes with female names"

08:42.498 --> 08:45.056
"than those with male names."

08:45.057 --> 08:46.936
It's like they don't take the...

08:46.937 --> 08:49.776
you know, the female
ones as a serious threat.

08:49.777 --> 08:53.295
It's almost like, you know,
"Oh! Cyclone Helen's on its way."

08:53.296 --> 08:56.455
"Oh! Oh, Helen might come over.
She might, you know..."

08:56.456 --> 08:59.575
"She might mess up my hair.
It'd be nice to see her, but..."

08:59.576 --> 09:03.014
Hurricane Rodney, he's like,
"Right. Rodney's on his way!"

09:03.015 --> 09:05.934
"He is angry!
Everybody downstairs, now!"

09:05.935 --> 09:08.694
See, that is completely in
the same vein as what happened

09:08.695 --> 09:11.135
with me and that man
that I tasered to death.

09:12.805 --> 09:13.836
Completely.

09:13.861 --> 09:16.660
Sorry, hang on. So... this
is related to that, is it?

09:16.661 --> 09:20.540
I think so, because I wasn't
taken seriously as a female.

09:20.541 --> 09:23.503
- I wanted to be taken seriously.
- Um, yep.

09:23.678 --> 09:26.557
I'm pretty sure you're
taken seriously now.

09:26.558 --> 09:28.597
- Especially by all the men here.
- Okay.

09:28.598 --> 09:30.437
"Don't park in April's spot."

09:30.438 --> 09:33.117
"Look, there she is, 'Crazy Tasey'."

09:33.118 --> 09:36.356
So it's, like, yeah, "'The Cock Taser'."

09:36.357 --> 09:39.436
I mean, I don't...
I don't condone it, but...

09:39.437 --> 09:41.636
Pretty funny play on words.

09:42.086 --> 09:43.596
Some of them.

09:44.364 --> 09:47.363
Anyway, I thought that
was an interesting article.

09:53.443 --> 09:55.402
- What's up?
- Forgot to feed the dog.

09:55.403 --> 09:56.882
What dog? You don't have a dog.

09:56.883 --> 09:59.322
- Haven't I told you about this?
- Since when?

09:59.323 --> 10:00.642
Get a load of this.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.121
- I'm down at Bunga'schop-shop, right?
- Oh, yeah.

10:03.122 --> 10:04.601
There's this dog hanging around.

10:04.602 --> 10:07.161
He's looking for food scraps or
something in the bins, you know?

10:07.162 --> 10:08.721
Beautiful-looking dog. Weimaraner.

10:08.722 --> 10:10.241
Gorgeous dog, right?

10:10.242 --> 10:11.841
I walk him home.

10:11.842 --> 10:14.160
Number's on the collar. Ring the number.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.240
Family comes down.
Nice enough family, you know?

10:16.241 --> 10:17.720
Sweet-looking family, you know?

10:17.721 --> 10:20.120
Father's probably, I don't
know, an accountant or something.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.800
Two kids. Nice young kids, you know?

10:21.801 --> 10:23.599
So they're pretty happy to see Brisket.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.119
Brisket. That was his name, right?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.999
This guy pulls out his
wallet. Hundred bucks.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.039
I said, "No, please. I don't
want the hundred bucks."

10:31.040 --> 10:34.278
"You know, just trying to do
the right thing here. It's okay."

10:34.279 --> 10:37.078
He says, "I insist. I want
you to take the hundred bucks."

10:37.079 --> 10:39.518
It's a bit embarrassing.
So I look at the kids.

10:39.519 --> 10:43.277
I say, "No, kids, you know,
I didn't do this for a reward."

10:43.278 --> 10:46.277
"I did this because I feel that
this is the right thing to do."

10:46.278 --> 10:50.637
"I wanna live in a world where
people just do the right thing"

10:50.638 --> 10:52.796
"because they feel it's
the right thing to do."

10:52.797 --> 10:55.036
Little sort of Martin
Luther King type speech.

10:55.037 --> 10:56.876
He's still waving the
hundred in front of me.

10:56.877 --> 10:58.836
You know? Almost insulting me.

10:58.837 --> 11:01.196
I said, finally, "Okay,
I'll take the hundred."

11:01.197 --> 11:04.435
"I feel bad about it, but I'll
take the hundred." Off they go.

11:04.436 --> 11:06.155
About a week later...

11:06.156 --> 11:08.315
what do I see
on this telegraph pole?

11:08.316 --> 11:11.195
- "Reward, dog lost..."
- Brisket. Brisket.

11:11.196 --> 11:12.675
- Brisket.
- Yeah, right.

11:12.676 --> 11:15.315
300.

11:16.755 --> 11:18.514
You weren't gonna take the hundred.

11:18.515 --> 11:20.434
That's not the point.
It's the principle.

11:20.435 --> 11:22.254
I'm down 200 bucks.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.833
So I go round to his
place three nights later

11:24.834 --> 11:26.633
and I steal the fuckin' dog.

11:27.681 --> 11:29.045
Did you want a dog?

11:30.665 --> 11:32.333
N... No, not particularly.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.395
But he's a beautiful dog. I love him.

11:38.996 --> 11:41.352
You know, your American films
have got a lot to answer for,

11:41.353 --> 11:44.511
because, you know... I mean, YOU
know it's not like the movies.

11:44.512 --> 11:47.028
It's a lot of this.
Lot of just sitting, waiting.

11:47.195 --> 11:48.711
You know, just waiting.

11:48.712 --> 11:51.271
If you knew why I was here,

11:51.272 --> 11:53.591
you wouldn't think this was boring.

11:55.551 --> 11:57.990
- Why are you here?
- Don't worry about it.

11:57.991 --> 12:00.070
A Mexican drug cartel?

12:00.071 --> 12:02.350
Or a Colombian drug cartel?

12:02.351 --> 12:03.829
Just sniff if it's Mexican.

12:03.830 --> 12:05.390
If it's Colombian, just do nothing.

12:07.230 --> 12:09.749
- So it's Mexican?
- I didn't say that.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.589
- No, you didn't.
- No, I literally didn't.

12:12.590 --> 12:15.348
- Okay, so it's Colombian?
- I didn't say that.

12:15.349 --> 12:17.668
No. You didn't.

12:17.669 --> 12:19.508
- What I'm telling you...
- Yeah.

12:19.509 --> 12:21.268
..is I didn't tell you anything.

12:21.269 --> 12:23.227
No, you didn't, and
that's what I'm saying.

12:23.228 --> 12:26.027
- Mm-hm. I know you didn't.
- Good.

12:26.028 --> 12:28.507
- 'Cause you're acting like I did.
- No, I'm not.

12:28.508 --> 12:30.227
If I was gonna tell anybody,

12:30.228 --> 12:32.707
I wouldn't tell you because I
don't trust you with a secret

12:32.708 --> 12:34.786
'cause I don't think you're
smart enough to keep it.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.118
That's right.

12:37.187 --> 12:39.146
'Cause I'm not a police officer.

12:39.147 --> 12:41.043
No, you are a police officer.
Or you're a detective.

12:41.068 --> 12:42.068
Yes.

12:42.093 --> 12:44.092
I think you're a real
low-level detective.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.865
And I don't think you could
handle the kind of information

12:48.866 --> 12:50.745
that I have.

12:50.746 --> 12:52.985
Do you get what I'm saying?

12:54.945 --> 12:56.464
Yeah.

12:56.465 --> 12:58.904
Car 72, please report.

12:58.905 --> 13:01.264
Yes, Car 72. No activity.

13:01.265 --> 13:03.103
No activity. Copy that.

13:03.104 --> 13:05.383
And we're gonna get
pregnant, okay, right?

13:05.384 --> 13:06.863
And I just thought,

13:06.864 --> 13:09.303
"This is it. Give her a
child, make her happy."

13:09.304 --> 13:10.783
The next minute, before I know it,

13:10.784 --> 13:12.782
she's telling me about
this pilot-semen bank.

13:12.783 --> 13:16.342
I think, okay, this is
our fourth time round now,

13:16.343 --> 13:20.262
and we're using a cup of
her dead husband's semen.

13:20.263 --> 13:22.062
- Right...
- Mmm.

13:22.063 --> 13:25.301
I mean, is it wrong
that I think it is okay

13:25.302 --> 13:29.941
to use a cup of another man's
semen to impregnate my wife?

13:29.942 --> 13:32.101
What does it say about me?

13:32.102 --> 13:34.060
I mean, what kind of man am I, hmm?

13:34.061 --> 13:35.900
I mean, I would do that out of love,

13:35.901 --> 13:37.900
but I... I... I'm a man.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.900
You know, my son's gonna
be there looking at me

13:39.901 --> 13:42.060
with his same hairline as Charles

13:42.061 --> 13:43.859
and those fantastic teeth.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.499
Just... Is that part of me?

13:46.500 --> 13:49.105
But I'm okay. Or am I? Hmm?

13:49.130 --> 13:51.579
Ha! That's what I'm saying.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.978
I don't know if I'm okay with it.

13:53.979 --> 13:55.978
But I'm gonna do it
all the same, you know?

13:55.979 --> 13:59.458
We've just got a whole
milk tray of cups lined up.

13:59.459 --> 14:01.618
- Bang, bang, bang!
- Mmm-hmm.

14:01.619 --> 14:04.457
- Obviously, we're not gonna drink them.
- No, I know.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.418
Sorry!

14:09.338 --> 14:12.577
It's just one of those
magic memories, you know?

14:12.578 --> 14:14.336
Completely, yeah.

14:14.337 --> 14:16.896
- What was his name?
- James.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.696
- Good name.
- 20. Just got his licence.

14:21.389 --> 14:23.895
- I can't believe I'm telling you this.
- Hmm!

14:23.896 --> 14:27.295
Anyway, he... he came and
picked me up in his car.

14:27.296 --> 14:31.135
It was a classic EH Holden, you know.

14:31.136 --> 14:33.814
And, um, we were driving around

14:33.815 --> 14:36.214
and Rod Stewart was
playing on the radio.

14:36.215 --> 14:37.209
Nice.

14:37.225 --> 14:40.436
And then we went up to, um...
oh, yeah, up to Kissing Point.

14:40.461 --> 14:41.504
Mmm!

14:41.505 --> 14:44.303
And, um, he was so nervous.

14:44.858 --> 14:46.223
One thing led to another,

14:46.224 --> 14:48.783
and we, you know,

14:48.784 --> 14:50.863
we had intercourse.

14:50.864 --> 14:55.209
He was so... he was
just, like, so thankful.

14:55.234 --> 14:58.182
And then I... I realised, you know,

14:58.183 --> 15:01.022
it was the first time
he'd seen a woman's flesh.

15:01.023 --> 15:02.821
Was he a virgin?

15:02.822 --> 15:05.141
Oh, wow!

15:05.142 --> 15:07.261
And, you know, I was sort of, like,

15:07.262 --> 15:09.901
"Wow. A couple of hours
ago, you were a virgin."

15:09.902 --> 15:12.221
"And now, you're...
you know, now you're a man."

15:12.222 --> 15:14.220
And I was there. I was a part of that.

15:14.221 --> 15:18.060
Like, I witnessed that. I was... Yeah.

15:18.061 --> 15:21.041
So it'll always be a special memory.

15:21.653 --> 15:23.159
- Just...
- Completely.

15:23.485 --> 15:25.921
I wonder where James is now.

15:27.432 --> 15:30.144
I'd say he'd probably
still be at laser tag.

15:30.843 --> 15:34.315
Sorry, so this was, like, recently?

15:36.478 --> 15:38.957
Two or three weeks ago.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.797
Oh, wow. Okay.

15:40.798 --> 15:43.236
- I mean, he's not The One or anything.
- No.

15:43.237 --> 15:45.876
I mean, he's at laser tag.

15:45.877 --> 15:47.556
I think that says a lot.

15:47.557 --> 15:49.356
Yeah.

15:49.357 --> 15:51.836
But, yeah, special.

15:55.896 --> 15:59.775
Car 72, please report.
Car 72, please report.

15:59.776 --> 16:03.495
Uh, Car 72, no activity. Thanks, April.

16:07.971 --> 16:09.650
I met April.

16:10.490 --> 16:11.850
You met April?

16:11.851 --> 16:14.649
- I met April when I first got in.
- Did you?

16:14.650 --> 16:17.129
Me, April and, uh, the older lady.

16:17.130 --> 16:18.929
- Carol?
- Carol.

16:18.930 --> 16:22.649
They showed me to my actual hotel
and we... Yeah.

16:22.650 --> 16:26.274
- And there at the bar, and Carol left.
- Ah.

16:26.274 --> 16:28.073
And April and I...

16:28.073 --> 16:33.071
I guess she gave me the official
Australian, uh, greeting.

16:33.072 --> 16:34.831
I fucked her.

16:36.408 --> 16:38.447
Don't tell her that I told you.

16:38.448 --> 16:40.447
- April? April?
- April.

16:40.449 --> 16:42.248
- In the bathroom. Yeah.
- From Dispatch?

16:42.249 --> 16:43.927
- Blonde hair...
- Yeah.

16:43.928 --> 16:45.767
She's, like, sucking my dick.
I'm like, "What the...?"

16:45.768 --> 16:48.167
I go, "Honey, I'm gonna pop.
I'm gonna pop. I'm gonna pop."

16:48.168 --> 16:50.247
- I'm not gonna lie...
- I'm gonna get some Chinese food.

16:50.248 --> 16:52.207
You want some Chinese
food? Do you want anything?

16:52.208 --> 16:54.366
- Sure.
- Yeah? What would you like?

16:54.367 --> 16:57.326
I don't care. Some sort of
chicken dish. Not too spicy.

16:57.327 --> 16:59.887
Okay. Uh, I'll be back in a minute.

17:02.379 --> 17:03.857
I'll just finish this story really fast.

17:03.858 --> 17:06.977
And a beef in
the black bean sauce, please.

17:06.978 --> 17:08.737
- And, uh...
- Sichuan.

17:08.738 --> 17:10.497
- Sichuan?
- Sichuan.

17:10.498 --> 17:12.257
- You want the beef?
- Yeah.

17:12.258 --> 17:14.776
And, uh,
one serve of Sichuan beef.

17:14.777 --> 17:17.896
Uh... Oh, no, no. Spicy.

17:17.896 --> 17:21.096
No, no takeaway. I can be pick up.

17:21.136 --> 17:23.069
Thank you very much.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.775
Mate, that's...
that's pretty racist, mate.

17:26.776 --> 17:28.815
Why?
I was... I mean, I...

17:28.816 --> 17:32.695
I mean, what do you mean? I
order Indian, Thai, Italian...

17:33.537 --> 17:34.866
You do all the accents?

17:34.891 --> 17:36.950
Well, it just makes it simple.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.574
And to be honest, I think, you
know, it's appreciated if...

17:40.575 --> 17:42.374
..gotta make a special effort.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.293
I welcome all cultures.

17:44.294 --> 17:45.813
What, by doing funny voices?

17:47.506 --> 17:48.875
You think that voice was funny?

17:50.294 --> 17:51.702
You're the racist.

17:52.910 --> 17:54.132
- Can I take this?
- Yeah.

17:54.133 --> 17:55.693
See you in 10 minutes.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.852
Don't... don't do the accent
when you go there, mate.

17:59.853 --> 18:01.572
You're the racist, mate.

18:01.963 --> 18:03.403
I am not.

18:04.633 --> 18:05.731
Am I?

18:05.732 --> 18:07.851
Intelligence
suggests that the big boss

18:07.852 --> 18:11.131
may arrive at the warehouse
sometime in the next 48 hours.

18:11.132 --> 18:14.570
Let's coordinate all units
to converge here asap.

18:14.571 --> 18:17.090
Basically, he pulled what
you thought was a weapon

18:17.091 --> 18:19.050
and then you shot him, yeah?

18:19.051 --> 18:20.530
- Bingo.
- Terrif. Okay.

18:20.531 --> 18:22.729
I'll fill in all those
other blanks later.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.489
We should do more of this.

18:24.490 --> 18:27.489
Fantastic, yeah. Give us a cuddle.

18:27.490 --> 18:30.809
Oh. No, look, that's fine.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.048
Um... listen, about your, um...

18:33.049 --> 18:35.768
I hope you don't mind me saying this,
but I think you might...

18:36.817 --> 18:39.344
It might be a good idea
for you to see a therapist

18:39.369 --> 18:41.488
or a counsellor or someone, you know?

18:41.489 --> 18:44.287
- But that's what you are.
- No, I'm not.

18:45.212 --> 18:46.309
What are you?

18:46.737 --> 18:48.207
I'm from the courts.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.007
- What?
- I'm just a...

18:50.008 --> 18:52.167
I'm a clerk from the courts.

18:52.168 --> 18:53.766
I've got to file an independent report

18:53.767 --> 18:55.905
on the shooting.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.489
That's why I'm here.

18:57.490 --> 18:59.784
Oh, that's bloody lovely, isn't it?

18:59.784 --> 19:03.382
Ha! I've been sitting here just
pouring all my shit out to you.

19:03.382 --> 19:05.981
- And you were writing it down.
- No, I wasn't.

19:05.982 --> 19:09.021
- Rub that shit out!
- It won't go in the report.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.501
I'm just doing a report on the shooting.

19:11.502 --> 19:13.340
Everything about you says 'counsellor'.

19:13.341 --> 19:15.380
What says 'counsellor' about me?

19:15.381 --> 19:17.180
Your demeanour. Your...

19:17.181 --> 19:19.580
The way you had me in the
foetal position on the couch.

19:19.581 --> 19:21.260
You put yourself in the foetal position.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.019
- You gave me tissues.
- I never gave you tissues.

19:24.020 --> 19:26.059
I am outraged over this, right?

19:26.060 --> 19:29.819
I haven't even told my
partner any of this stuff.

19:30.567 --> 19:33.818
You... Shit.

19:41.486 --> 19:44.045
Ah. Uh...

19:45.125 --> 19:49.764
Ah! Mate, you wouldn't happen to
have 20 cents you could give me?

19:49.765 --> 19:51.844
- I'm... I'm short by 20 cents.
- Oh, yeah.

19:51.845 --> 19:53.843
- It's ridiculous.
- There's a dollar. Keep the change.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.443
Thank you very much. Let me give you...

19:55.444 --> 19:57.163
Give it as a tip. Honestly.

19:57.164 --> 19:58.843
- All right. Thanks.
- Yeah.

19:58.844 --> 20:00.644
Thank you.

20:03.079 --> 20:04.282
Thanks, Tony.

20:04.283 --> 20:06.082
I'll just get this.

20:08.483 --> 20:12.562
You getting away?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.679
Holiday or road trip or...?

20:16.232 --> 20:20.168
- Oh, yeah. Uh... Road trip.
- Ah.

20:23.216 --> 20:24.855
Yeah, with the old man.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.895
We're heading up to Emerald,

20:26.896 --> 20:29.655
on the Sapphire Coast,
just north of Woolgoolga.

20:29.656 --> 20:32.095
- Oh, lovely.
- Yeah, well.

20:32.096 --> 20:34.934
10 hours in the car with
your old man's, you know...

20:34.935 --> 20:37.378
- Sometimes, uh...
- Backseat driver?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.654
Well, front-seat driver.
He insists on driving.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.774
Insists on talking
every step of the way.

20:41.775 --> 20:43.373
If I had a dollar for every kilometre

20:43.374 --> 20:46.013
of good advice I got from the old man,

20:46.014 --> 20:47.493
I'd be a multimillionaire.

20:47.494 --> 20:49.253
Oh, mate, tell me about it.

20:49.254 --> 20:51.573
I'm heading home. Just been
away with the wife and kids.

20:51.574 --> 20:53.412
Oh, it's school holidays, isn't it?

20:53.413 --> 20:55.012
- Yeah, it is.
- Easter holidays.

20:55.013 --> 20:57.612
Yeah, that's right. We've gotta
get the kids back to school.

20:57.613 --> 21:01.412
And, um, oh, my God,
it's just... relentless.

21:01.413 --> 21:03.131
You know, "Mehmehmehmeh," in the back.

21:03.132 --> 21:04.811
And "Mehmehmehmeh!
You missed the turn-off."

21:04.812 --> 21:06.291
You're just,
"April, settle down. Back off."

21:06.292 --> 21:08.935
- How many kids you got?
- Two. Twins. Yeah.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.506
- Eight years old.
- Yeah, right.

21:10.531 --> 21:11.738
Jeff and Donna.

21:12.612 --> 21:14.650
Older names, but they're family names.

21:14.651 --> 21:16.130
Yeah, right, from the family.

21:16.131 --> 21:19.130
And, you know, it's lovely
and God bless family,

21:19.131 --> 21:21.170
but every now and
then, it's all I can do

21:21.171 --> 21:23.849
to stop myself from swerving
into oncoming traffic.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.329
- You know?
- I know.

21:25.330 --> 21:27.969
If I had the freedom I had
when I was single, you know?

21:27.970 --> 21:30.653
If I could bottle that. I never
knew what I had when I had it.

21:30.678 --> 21:32.223
You don't know what you've got
till it's gone.

21:32.248 --> 21:33.248
That's true.

21:33.249 --> 21:34.728
But family, you've gotta love 'em.

21:34.729 --> 21:36.768
It's everything. Family is everything.

21:36.769 --> 21:39.088
I mean, was it Mother Teresa who said

21:39.089 --> 21:41.155
if you wanna work towards world peace,

21:41.163 --> 21:43.001
just go home and love your family.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.561
- She said that?
- Yeah.

21:44.562 --> 21:46.121
She didn't have any kids.

21:46.122 --> 21:47.681
No, no, she was a nun.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.681
But she had, you know, her orphanage.

21:49.682 --> 21:52.321
She saw a lot of...
That's why they called her Mother.

21:52.322 --> 21:54.680
Like Michael Jackson.
The world's just kind of family.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.680
Yeah, yeah, it wasn't
a biological thing...

21:56.681 --> 21:59.121
- Yeah, right.
- Is the point.

22:02.761 --> 22:04.399
Xie xie.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.199
Well, all the best with the old man.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.959
Thanks for the, uh...

22:10.960 --> 22:12.479
- Don't mention it.
- 20 cents.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.125
- All the best.
- See you.

22:17.994 --> 22:19.713
Thank you very much.

22:19.714 --> 22:22.794
Is this the kung pao? Extra spicy?
