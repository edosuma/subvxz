WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:03.204
Morning, Scully.
How was your weekend?

00:03.205 --> 00:07.308
Oh, fun. Kelly and I hit
the park, went for a long walk.

00:07.309 --> 00:08.776
Fell asleep watching TV.

00:08.810 --> 00:12.713
Oh. Sounds like a fun
weekend with Kelly.

00:12.714 --> 00:15.783
So, Kelly. Is that
Scully's wife or his dog?

00:15.817 --> 00:17.751
Uh...
<i>Wait.</i>

00:17.786 --> 00:18.953
No one knows
Scully's wife's name?

00:18.987 --> 00:20.421
I think Kelly is his dog.

00:20.422 --> 00:22.189
Went for a long walk.
That's what you do with a dog.

00:22.224 --> 00:24.391
You can go on a long
walk with a person.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.626
At sunset.

00:25.627 --> 00:27.728
Talking about nothing.
And everything.

00:27.729 --> 00:30.564
Sounds awful.
Hit the park. That's a dog.

00:30.599 --> 00:33.300
My wife takes the babies
to the park all the time.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.135
All right, we're doing this.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.403
Let's play "wife or dog."

00:36.404 --> 00:38.539
Hey, so Scully,

00:38.573 --> 00:40.674
what do you do
at the park with Kelly?

00:40.675 --> 00:42.209
Oh, we just walk around.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.411
She gets antsy if she doesn't
get outside enough.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.448
And then it's just
yap, yap, yap, all day long.

00:47.482 --> 00:50.317
<i>Hey,
what's Kelly's favorite food?</i>

00:50.352 --> 00:53.354
Peanut butter. She'll eat it
right out of the jar.

00:53.355 --> 00:54.555
How old is Kelly again?

00:54.589 --> 00:55.823
Well, she's getting up there,

00:55.824 --> 00:57.658
but she's pretty spry
for her age.

00:57.659 --> 00:59.760
Especially considering she got
hit by that car a year ago.

00:59.761 --> 01:01.428
Oh, that's so awful.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.264
Was she chasing something
into the street, or...

01:03.298 --> 01:05.766
No. Just getting me
the newspaper.

01:05.767 --> 01:07.468
All right, this is useless.

01:07.469 --> 01:09.003
Scully, is Kelly
your wife or your dog?

01:09.037 --> 01:12.606
How can you ask me that?

01:12.607 --> 01:14.508
I still don't know
which it is.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.577
- <i>Could be either.</i>
- I could not tell you.

01:36.631 --> 01:38.132
<i>Okay, what do you got?</i>

01:38.166 --> 01:40.134
Yup.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.935
Oh, sir, are you
looking for your glasses?

01:41.970 --> 01:44.138
I borrowed them to do
an impression of you.

01:44.139 --> 01:45.139
It killed.

01:45.140 --> 01:47.808
Peralta, give me my glasses.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.044
Peralta, give me back
my glasses.

01:50.078 --> 01:51.145
Okay.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.680
All right, lay out
the steroids case.

01:52.714 --> 01:54.281
It's a major operation.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.516
And one of the biggest
black market distributors

01:55.517 --> 01:56.817
in all of Brooklyn.

01:56.851 --> 02:00.487
And it's centered at a gym
called Brooklyn total body.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.539
The center of our investigation
is a guy named Brandon jacoby.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.392
<i>He did seven years
at Rikers for assault.</i>

02:07.796 --> 02:10.564
We spent two weeks undercover
infiltrating the gym.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.933
"Gym-filtrating" it.
I coined that.

02:12.934 --> 02:15.669
I think it'll really catch on
if more people infiltrated gyms.

02:15.704 --> 02:18.872
We believe that jacoby can
link us to the distributors,

02:18.873 --> 02:21.375
but he only talks to trainers
and other muscle heads.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.310
So we want to
bring in the sarge.

02:23.345 --> 02:25.045
<i>His name will be
Trent Carter.</i>

02:25.080 --> 02:26.380
A personal trainer, bouncer,

02:26.381 --> 02:29.049
and assistant manager
at petsmart.

02:29.050 --> 02:30.784
It's the economy.
What can you do?

02:30.819 --> 02:32.486
Gentlemen, have a seat.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.788
Sergeant Jeffords is just
getting back in the field.

02:34.789 --> 02:35.789
What if he panics again?

02:35.824 --> 02:37.658
Why is everyone so worried
about the sarge?

02:37.659 --> 02:39.660
I mean, he saved your life
at the rail yard.

02:39.694 --> 02:42.529
Okay. It's your case.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.298
But if anything goes wrong,
it's on you.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.900
Trust me, the sergeant
will be fine.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.902
If you want to worry about
anyone panicking in the field

02:48.903 --> 02:50.003
it should be Boyle.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.039
Damn straight.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.240
Wait, why'd
high five that?

02:53.241 --> 02:54.842
'Cause you're a sucker
for a high five.

02:54.843 --> 02:58.011
Damn straight I am.

02:58.046 --> 03:00.381
Captain, I need a favor.

03:00.382 --> 03:02.483
My apartment got
broken into last night.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.251
Gina, that's terrible.
Are you okay?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.587
I'm fine,
but I suffered the loss

03:06.588 --> 03:08.389
of many treasured items.

03:08.390 --> 03:11.091
<i>Such as my grandma's jewelry,
some cash,</i>

03:11.126 --> 03:15.963
and this very fancy gown
with, like, a magic eye print.

03:15.997 --> 03:18.265
Do you have any connections
in the FBI or CIA?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.901
There's no one else I can
turn to to solve this crime.

03:20.902 --> 03:22.403
Gina, you work
in a police precinct.

03:22.404 --> 03:23.404
You can turn
to anyone here.

03:23.438 --> 03:25.205
You think these
buffoons can help?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.240
They're buffoons.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.741
They are not buffoons.

03:27.776 --> 03:30.277
Try the heel.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.414
Still don't feel anything.

03:33.448 --> 03:36.183
Awesome. I wish I had
nerve damage.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.419
Some of them are buffoons.

03:38.420 --> 03:40.587
But I'll find the non-buffoons
to investigate.

03:40.622 --> 03:43.590
Could you ask Scully
to return my thumbtacks?

03:43.625 --> 03:45.292
I already put 'em
in a biohazard bag

03:45.293 --> 03:46.760
and tossed 'em
in the furnace.

03:46.761 --> 03:47.795
Good call.

03:47.829 --> 03:49.496
You ready, sarge?

03:49.497 --> 03:50.664
I was born ready.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.866
And then I was not
born ready for a while,

03:52.867 --> 03:54.435
but now I'm back
to being born ready.

03:54.436 --> 03:57.004
Yes! The ebony falcon
soars again.

03:57.038 --> 03:58.338
The ebony falcon.

03:58.373 --> 04:00.307
His feathers are muscles.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.543
Let's talk strategy
later tonight at my house.

04:02.544 --> 04:04.611
My wife's working late,
I'm on daddy duty.

04:04.646 --> 04:05.946
But you're ready
for this, right?

04:05.947 --> 04:07.381
Absolutely.

04:07.382 --> 04:10.784
I just need to put my precious
babies to bed with a story.

04:10.785 --> 04:14.588
The ebony falcon needs
to read <i>go, dog, go.</i>

04:14.622 --> 04:15.823
Yeah, he does.

04:15.824 --> 04:17.673
Terry Jeffords is back!
Chest bump me.

04:17.692 --> 04:18.692
You don't want
to do this, man.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.692
No, I really do.

04:19.694 --> 04:20.793
It hurts you every time.

04:20.829 --> 04:21.928
No, I know, but I'm fired up.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.230
The adrenaline is gonna
carry me through.

04:23.231 --> 04:24.298
Here we go.

04:30.305 --> 04:32.406
No signs of forced entry
at the door.

04:32.407 --> 04:33.807
But the window was jimmied.

04:33.808 --> 04:35.142
You don't have locks
on your windows.

04:35.176 --> 04:36.577
Way to blame the victim.

04:36.578 --> 04:38.979
Sorry I'm not rich
like you, miss 1%.

04:39.013 --> 04:41.882
They cost $8.
You have a fur bedspread.

04:41.883 --> 04:44.184
Why do you have so many
lycra bodysuits?

04:44.185 --> 04:46.820
And why do you need eight
full drawers of underwear?

04:46.855 --> 04:48.822
Because I'm civilized.

04:48.823 --> 04:50.958
Less talky-talk,
more solvey-solve.

04:50.992 --> 04:53.026
We need an itemized list
of everything that was stolen.

04:53.061 --> 04:54.628
I already gave it
to Captain Holt.

04:54.662 --> 04:58.499
$160 in cash, one TV,

04:58.533 --> 05:01.201
one large painting
of a naked lady on a lion,

05:01.236 --> 05:03.837
<i>one set of Joseph Gordon-levitt
nesting dolls...</i>

05:03.838 --> 05:04.838
Wow.

05:04.839 --> 05:06.840
Homemade and irreplaceable.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.575
One music box that plays

05:08.576 --> 05:11.345
<i>she works hard for the money</i>
when opened.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.579
One knockoff
designer clutch...

05:12.614 --> 05:14.181
Can't you just buy
another knockoff?

05:14.215 --> 05:16.250
No, I can't, silly sue.

05:16.251 --> 05:18.719
'Cause the label no longer
makes the original,

05:18.720 --> 05:21.021
so the sweatshop no longer
makes the knockoff.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.857
Can you estimate the value
of everything that was taken?

05:23.892 --> 05:28.829
Emotionally, $700 million.

05:30.365 --> 05:32.232
Somebody at the door.
Yeah.

05:32.233 --> 05:33.232
<i>Hey, sarge.</i>

05:33.234 --> 05:35.102
Sorry about the mess.

05:35.103 --> 05:36.236
<i>Hi, Cagney. Hi, Lacey.</i>

05:36.271 --> 05:38.906
Hey, your kids like
the same kind of cereal as me.

05:38.940 --> 05:40.207
Well, we just
finished story time.

05:40.241 --> 05:42.075
I'm gonna kiss
the girls night-night,

05:42.076 --> 05:43.744
then we can get down
to business.

05:43.745 --> 05:46.079
All right,
time for night-night, girls.

05:46.114 --> 05:48.882
He is so strong
but so gentle.

05:48.883 --> 05:51.652
He's like an enormous,
muscular Ellen Degeneres.

05:51.686 --> 05:54.254
You know, I just want
to let you guys know

05:54.255 --> 05:56.924
that I love you girls
so, so muc

05:56.958 --> 05:58.725
okay? So sleep tight.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.828
You know, daddy will never
leave you, right, girls?

06:01.863 --> 06:03.564
<i>Night-night, daddy.</i>

06:03.565 --> 06:06.767
Gosh. Really makes you
understand what he went through.

06:06.768 --> 06:08.435
I'm worried about Terry.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.638
We can't let anything bad
happen to him.

06:13.894 --> 06:14.927
Jake, where are you?

06:14.961 --> 06:18.330
In here.

06:18.331 --> 06:19.732
Oh...

06:19.733 --> 06:21.634
This is a classy tepee.

06:21.635 --> 06:23.502
Should we get these
instead of desks at work?

06:23.537 --> 06:25.004
We have to get Terry
off this case.

06:25.038 --> 06:26.105
What? Why?

06:26.139 --> 06:27.473
Look, I thought
he was a weirdo

06:27.474 --> 06:29.642
for having his year-long
freak-out, but I get it now.

06:29.643 --> 06:32.111
He has children. What happens
to them if he gets hurt?

06:32.112 --> 06:33.379
I'll have to
take care of them.

06:33.413 --> 06:36.182
Or his wife or other family
or his more mature friends,

06:36.183 --> 06:37.516
but interesting point.

06:37.517 --> 06:39.018
Why is this just
hitting you now?

06:39.052 --> 06:41.020
I don't know, I guess I just
hadn't seen his kids in so long

06:41.021 --> 06:43.322
he never takes them around
the precinct for some reason.

06:43.323 --> 06:45.191
Because of
all the guns and danger.

06:45.192 --> 06:47.460
If you have concerns, maybe you
should talk to Terry about it.

06:47.461 --> 06:49.161
No. And you can't either.

06:49.162 --> 06:50.663
If he finds out
we're worried about him,

06:50.664 --> 06:52.064
it'll get in his head
and freak him out.

06:52.065 --> 06:53.432
He'll lose his edge
and panic.

06:53.433 --> 06:55.234
Yeah, that's why I've never
tried to develop an edge.

06:55.235 --> 06:56.502
You can't lose
what you don't have.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.503
No surprises.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.604
What are you guys
talking about?

06:58.605 --> 07:00.139
Work. International
taxes and tariffs.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.740
Work.

07:01.741 --> 07:02.741
Heh.

07:02.742 --> 07:03.976
<i>So...</i>

07:04.010 --> 07:05.344
What's the plan at the gym?

07:05.345 --> 07:06.545
Well, I say
we slow-play it.

07:06.546 --> 07:07.546
You know?

07:07.547 --> 07:08.647
Do a little more setup,

07:08.648 --> 07:09.982
a little surveillance,

07:09.983 --> 07:12.651
wait a couple months and see
if they turn themselves in.

07:12.686 --> 07:14.587
Listen, man, I know
everybody's worried about me

07:14.588 --> 07:16.388
being psychologically
ready for this.

07:16.389 --> 07:18.157
But I promise you I am.

07:18.158 --> 07:19.525
No matter what happens,

07:19.526 --> 07:21.193
no matter how many
bullets are flying,

07:21.194 --> 07:23.996
I'm gonna be right there
in the middle of everything.

07:23.997 --> 07:25.898
<i>I got your back.</i>

07:25.899 --> 07:29.602
No, it's not even that,
you know, it's just...

07:29.603 --> 07:31.437
Well, frankly, I'm not so sure
that everyone at the gym

07:31.438 --> 07:32.838
is gonna buy you as a trainer.

07:32.873 --> 07:34.753
You've been sitting behind
that desk for so long

07:34.774 --> 07:36.075
you've gotten
a little tubby.

07:36.076 --> 07:38.143
Right? It's like,
love handle alert!

07:38.144 --> 07:39.645
Do you have a bone
there somehow?

07:39.679 --> 07:43.816
Jake, I promise.
I'm good.

07:43.817 --> 07:45.251
Oops.

07:45.285 --> 07:48.654
I gotta put this stuffed giraffe
between my two girls.

07:48.655 --> 07:52.124
They both like to snuggle
against his head.

07:52.158 --> 07:53.359
Here comes Mr. snuggles.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.895
Here comes
Mr. snuggles.

07:58.899 --> 07:59.999
Okay, thanks.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.701
Crime tech report from
your apartment came back.

08:02.702 --> 08:04.270
Apparently they found
a strand of hair

08:04.271 --> 08:05.771
belonging to Mario Lopez.

08:05.772 --> 08:07.873
I bought a lock of his hair
at an auction.

08:07.874 --> 08:10.042
That's cool it's real.

08:10.043 --> 08:11.410
What'd they say
about the prints?

08:11.411 --> 08:13.112
None of the partials
returned any matches.

08:13.113 --> 08:15.581
Nobody in your building
saw anything. We've hit a wall.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.949
So what do we do next?

08:16.950 --> 08:19.018
Do I just look
for another apartment?

08:19.019 --> 08:20.853
Should I buy a handgun?

08:20.854 --> 08:22.454
Should I buy
a shotgun?

08:22.455 --> 08:23.656
Should I buy an uzi?

08:23.690 --> 08:26.292
Look, Gina,
we've done all we can.

08:26.293 --> 08:27.893
This is how it goes
with most B and es.

08:27.928 --> 08:29.962
Mm. All right.

08:29.996 --> 08:32.298
C'est la vie. Let me grab
your badge numbers.

08:32.332 --> 08:33.599
'Cause I will be filing

08:33.600 --> 08:35.701
an official civilian
complaint with the Captain.

08:39.839 --> 08:40.839
Why did I just receive

08:40.840 --> 08:42.201
a civilian complaint
about you two?

08:42.207 --> 08:43.708
I can answer this.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.844
Because your assistant
is a goblin.

08:45.879 --> 08:47.313
Captain, we swept the scene,
ran the prints,

08:47.347 --> 08:51.517
canvassed the building.
We followed procedure.

08:51.518 --> 08:56.121
"Procedure" is just a fancy word
for proper order to do things.

08:56.122 --> 08:58.090
Yes, that is it's definition.

08:58.091 --> 09:00.159
This is a miscarriage
of justice.

09:00.193 --> 09:01.994
I'm gonna haunt your dreams.

09:10.236 --> 09:11.537
You sure you can lift
this much weight?

09:11.571 --> 09:13.439
Are you kidding me?

09:13.440 --> 09:15.975
I was the strongest kid in
my camp seven summers in a row.

09:15.976 --> 09:17.309
It would've been eight

09:17.310 --> 09:19.078
if that freak Rebecca Lobelman
hadn't showed up.

09:19.112 --> 09:21.313
Let's put in work.

09:21.314 --> 09:22.314
And here we go.

09:22.315 --> 09:23.349
One.

09:23.350 --> 09:25.017
And I'm done. That's it.

09:25.018 --> 09:27.019
Oh, good rep.
Don't wanna get too bulky.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.388
Two things.

09:29.389 --> 09:31.423
First, this gym's wipe-down
policy is criminally lax.

09:31.424 --> 09:32.591
So I rewrote it.

09:32.592 --> 09:34.059
Second, I lowered
the temperature

09:34.060 --> 09:35.594
of the water fountain
by two degrees.

09:35.629 --> 09:37.129
Still waiting on feedback,

09:37.163 --> 09:39.765
but I see a lot
of refreshed faces.

09:39.766 --> 09:41.327
Also Brandon jacoby
should be here soon.

09:41.334 --> 09:43.335
How was that not
one of your two things?

09:43.336 --> 09:45.037
I gave his regular trainer
the day off,

09:45.038 --> 09:47.272
I told him Trent
would be filling in.

09:47.273 --> 09:50.142
It was an interesting
interaction.

09:50.143 --> 09:52.911
Well, according to my new
cloud-based scheduling system,

09:52.946 --> 09:55.681
your trainer is out,
and Trent will be filling in.

09:59.285 --> 10:02.755
I spent 40 minutes making that
water bottle pyramid display.

10:02.756 --> 10:04.223
This guy is a psycho.

10:04.257 --> 10:06.025
You know the best way
to deal with psychos.

10:06.026 --> 10:08.961
The silent treatment. We should
draw him out by not engaging.

10:08.995 --> 10:10.396
Nope.

10:10.397 --> 10:12.531
The longer we wait the more
likely our cover gets blown.

10:12.532 --> 10:13.999
I'll make contact.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.367
Okay, but just remember.

10:15.368 --> 10:17.970
You're not Terry.
You're Trent.

10:17.971 --> 10:22.207
Trainer and known hemophiliac,
so be careful.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.177
Trent is also a quaker who
avoids violence at all costs.

10:27.047 --> 10:31.083
You Trent?

10:31.084 --> 10:35.154
Yup. A black Trent.
One of many.

10:35.155 --> 10:36.922
Uh, what do you want
to start with today?

10:36.923 --> 10:38.824
Weights.

10:38.825 --> 10:40.626
Excuse me, sir.
Can I borrow this machine?

10:40.627 --> 10:42.695
I need to be here to keep
an eye on a friend.

10:44.230 --> 10:46.365
Hold on. I'm on my last set.

10:46.366 --> 10:47.366
Okay.

10:47.367 --> 10:51.303
Two...

10:51.304 --> 10:52.738
Three...

10:52.739 --> 10:54.273
Can you go any faster?

10:54.274 --> 10:55.474
I mean, what do you need
leg muscles for anyway?

10:55.475 --> 10:56.809
You're, like, 100 years old.

10:56.810 --> 10:58.944
Socially acceptable for you
to roll around on a scooter.

10:58.945 --> 11:02.247
I lost the count.

11:02.248 --> 11:03.248
One.

11:03.249 --> 11:04.248
One?

11:05.785 --> 11:06.785
<i>You're not even moving.
Let's go.</i>

11:06.786 --> 11:08.454
Get your hands off me!

11:08.455 --> 11:10.155
I've heard about this
in the news!

11:10.156 --> 11:12.024
You're cyber-bullying me!
Shh!

11:12.025 --> 11:13.559
I'm getting the manager!
Get the hell away from me!

11:13.560 --> 11:15.961
No, you're very misinformed.
Please don't...

11:15.962 --> 11:17.262
Damn it.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.222
Hey. Have you seen Terry?
I lost him.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.157
His children could be
orphans already.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.360
Fatherless,
mother-having orphans.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.195
I'm sure he's fine.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.097
I think the bigger issue
is the complaint I received

11:38.098 --> 11:39.465
from an older gentleman

11:39.466 --> 11:41.200
saying you tried to
hurry him off his machine,

11:41.201 --> 11:42.868
in open defiance
of gym protocol.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.069
Don't do this.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.572
I know we're friends,
but if you do that again,

11:46.573 --> 11:47.873
I'm gonna have to
suspend your membership.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.141
What have you become?

11:49.175 --> 11:50.609
Me. I've become me.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.610
What?

11:51.611 --> 11:53.212
Oh, sarge, thank God.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.680
Where were you?
What happened?

11:54.681 --> 11:57.850
Nothing happened. Jacoby wanted
to do wind sprints outside.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.652
You know, he's a mean dude,
but I think I'm making progress.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.022
He asked to borrow
my squat belt, I told him no,

12:03.023 --> 12:04.323
he respected that.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.992
Okay, but let's build up
that relationship slowly, okay?

12:06.993 --> 12:09.528
We don't want to
jump the gun and spook him.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.430
<i>Whew!</i>

12:11.431 --> 12:13.799
'Sup?
Good workout.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.002
You know, it's weird I never
worked out with you before.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.437
What'd you say
your regular gym was?

12:18.471 --> 12:22.007
I didn't.
Brooklyn bulk fitness.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.409
Huh?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.443
I work out there too.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.112
<i>Never heard of any Trent.</i>

12:27.147 --> 12:29.448
I don't know why.
I work out there all the time.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.917
Really? Starting when?

12:31.918 --> 12:34.219
NYPD, hands on your head!
My God, you're gigantic.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.822
What are you doing, Peralta?
You just blew my cover!

12:36.856 --> 12:38.424
Or did I save your life?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.626
Or did you compromise
an investigation

12:40.627 --> 12:42.428
and piss off
a superior officer?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.596
I'm sensing from your tone
it's that one.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.266
<i>I need some afternoon coffee.</i>

12:48.301 --> 12:49.501
What's the matter with you?

12:49.502 --> 12:52.571
Gina came by my house last night
to go over the case.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.641
Between us doing that and her
using my bread maker all night,

12:55.642 --> 12:57.876
I didn't get much sleep.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.145
I will say she makes
a wonderful rye.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.381
So dense, yet so moist.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.383
Hello, ladies.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.118
<i>Since you have allowed
crime to win,</i>

13:06.152 --> 13:10.389
I've hired a private
investigator to solve my case.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.291
Say hello to Leo Sporm.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.327
A P.I.?
These guys are hacks.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.963
How do you know if your
husband's a murderer?

13:17.997 --> 13:20.065
You don't.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.800
<i>Call Leo now.</i>

13:21.801 --> 13:23.635
Leo Sporm.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.970
<i>How's business?</i>

13:25.004 --> 13:26.004
You know this guy?

13:26.005 --> 13:27.139
<i>Everyone knows him.</i>

13:27.140 --> 13:29.308
The Picasso of hucksters.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.809
I like that.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.645
"Look up who Picasso is."

13:33.680 --> 13:35.114
Sporm. Out.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.816
<i>Now.</i>

13:37.817 --> 13:39.017
You blew our cover, man!

13:39.018 --> 13:41.353
Now I gotta go into an
interrogation with no evidence

13:41.354 --> 13:43.622
and try to get jacoby
to rat out his distributors!

13:43.623 --> 13:45.157
I'm sorry, I got jumpy.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.092
I wasn't thinking straight.
It was all the exercise.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.994
The blood from my head
rushed into my delts.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.897
Point to your delts, Jake.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.799
There is...

13:53.800 --> 13:55.334
You didn't have to
hop in there, man.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.303
I can handle this.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.304
What's my name?

13:59.305 --> 14:00.305
Terry Jeffords.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.840
What is my name?

14:01.875 --> 14:02.874
The ebony falcon.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.776
And what does
the ebony falcon do?

14:04.777 --> 14:07.679
Takes every precaution to
ensure his own safety?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.149
Takes bad guys to jail
and bad girls to bed.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.583
Hell yeah, he does.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.285
Except now the ebony falcon
is monogamous

14:13.286 --> 14:15.287
and too tired for sex,
so his only indulgence

14:15.288 --> 14:20.292
is fresh fruit
yogurt parfaits.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.161
Terry loves yogurt.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.196
How's it going?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.365
Well, so far jacoby
hasn't given anything up,

14:26.366 --> 14:27.833
but I think Terry's
starting to get to him.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.001
I'm not talking.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.836
You're talking right now!

14:30.837 --> 14:31.970
Boom!

14:31.971 --> 14:35.841
I'm already in your head.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.342
Sarge is safe in there,

14:37.343 --> 14:39.044
so the longer this
interrogation goes the better.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.046
We gotta solve the case
before he does.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.948
Hey, tell me about that new
system you set up at the gym

14:42.949 --> 14:44.316
for scheduling appointments.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.451
I've been waiting so long
to hear you say those words.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.719
Come with me.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.657
Experience the future
of cloud-based scheduling.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.824
Okay.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.060
I put all
the trainers' schedules

14:55.061 --> 14:56.828
into a shared online calendar.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.997
Aside from the cucumber water
at the front desk,

14:58.998 --> 15:01.233
it's probably my greatest
accomplishment ever.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.202
Hang on a sec.
Who's this guy?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.903
Says he's a personal
trainer at the gym,

15:04.938 --> 15:06.572
but he has no regular hours.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.106
He always makes
last-minute appointments,

15:08.107 --> 15:10.475
always in the boxing area,
and always late at night.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.377
And look who he trains.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.545
Brandon jacoby.

15:13.546 --> 15:14.947
That's probably
our supplier.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.249
We should set up a buy
from this Vladimir Rincic.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.085
All right. We should set up
a tactical team and hit the gym.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.520
And sergeant Jeffries
should stay here

15:21.521 --> 15:23.622
and keep interrogating jacoby
for as many hours

15:23.623 --> 15:25.390
or years as necessary.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.025
Are you sure
I shouldn't go get him?

15:27.026 --> 15:29.361
I feel a little uncomfortable
leaving him out of this.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.696
Don't think of it
as leaving him out

15:30.697 --> 15:32.764
so much as including his babies
in having a father.

15:32.799 --> 15:33.865
Let's go.

15:33.866 --> 15:34.866
<i>Detectives.</i>

15:34.867 --> 15:35.968
Where are you going?

15:35.969 --> 15:37.869
Just headed out
to close the steroid case.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.072
Isn't sergeant Jeffries
interrogating the suspect now?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.473
Yup, he's got that
locked up.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.141
We're following up
on this lead.

15:43.142 --> 15:45.410
The whole team is running
smoothly and perfectly

15:45.411 --> 15:49.581
like a well-lubed,
oiled time clock... bye.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.384
<i>Why do you think
Gina hired that P.I.?</i>

15:52.385 --> 15:53.619
To mock us.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.787
She's scared.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.155
She's not scared.

15:57.156 --> 16:00.292
With all due respect, sir,
Gina has no feelings.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.361
She once said
the best comedy of all time

16:02.362 --> 16:04.296
was <i>the girl
with the dragon tattoo.</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:06.131
Well, think about
how she's been acting.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.133
Gina came by my house
last night.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.468
Do I buy an uzi?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.437
I asked for a police officer
to escort me to work,

16:12.438 --> 16:14.539
and it took a while
for dispatch to find me

16:14.540 --> 16:16.808
a young Kevin costner type.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.745
Her home doesn't
feel safe anymore.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.246
If someone broke
into your apartment

16:21.247 --> 16:23.915
and you weren't cops,
wouldn't you be scared?

16:23.916 --> 16:26.018
Yes.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.487
Depends. How many guns
do I still have hidden?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.488
None.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.024
Do I still have my knife?
Nunchucks?

16:32.025 --> 16:33.325
Axe?

16:33.359 --> 16:35.761
It was a hypothetical
question.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.562
I know, but I want
to play it out.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.431
Do I still have
my throwing stars?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.967
This has taken
a strange turn.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.136
Fine. I'd be scared.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.471
<i>We're on it.</i>

16:46.472 --> 16:48.774
What kind of woman
doesn't have an axe?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.678
All right, we're all set
for the sting.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.646
<i>We got hidden cameras,
wireless mics,</i>

16:54.647 --> 16:56.348
and tactical teams
by all the exits.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.517
I told Vladimir to meet
Vance Vandervaven,

16:58.518 --> 17:00.185
a.K.A. me, here at 10:00.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.853
Said that I was
filling in for jacoby.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.689
You and I will be sparring
when he arrives.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.924
Cool.
I boxed at the academy.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.693
They invented a new
weight class for me.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.529
You're looking at the undisputed
bubbleweight champion.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.863
<i>Hey! Peralta!</i>

17:11.864 --> 17:13.665
Boyle!
Sarge, hey.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.434
I'm so psyched you
made it here to the sting

17:15.435 --> 17:18.369
that I definitely told
Charles to tell you about.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.371
You lied to me!

17:19.372 --> 17:20.872
I can see that
you're upset,

17:20.873 --> 17:22.473
but let's just sit down
and talk about it.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.876
Done talking!

17:24.877 --> 17:27.079
Time to dance.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.147
Fine. But I should warn you.

17:29.148 --> 17:30.849
I took three years of tap.

17:36.512 --> 17:38.079
Again, sarge,
it's so good to see you.

17:38.113 --> 17:40.481
Just out of curiosity,
how did you find out about this?

17:40.516 --> 17:43.785
I'm a Detective sergeant
in the NYPD.

17:43.786 --> 17:46.621
Holt told me. Why are you
cutting me out of the operation?

17:46.655 --> 17:48.289
What? That's crazy!

17:48.323 --> 17:49.590
Boyle, come in here
and stand in front of my body

17:49.625 --> 17:51.292
and tell him that's crazy.

17:51.326 --> 17:53.327
Ow! My lucky face!

17:53.362 --> 17:55.063
You gonna talk to me now?

17:55.097 --> 17:57.265
Sure. If you could be
any vacation...

17:57.299 --> 17:58.299
Oh!

17:58.300 --> 18:00.701
You didn't let me finish.

18:00.702 --> 18:02.837
If you could be any vacation,
what would you be?

18:02.838 --> 18:03.971
I'd be skiing.

18:04.006 --> 18:05.306
Oh, now I'm gonna
hit you for real.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.141
That wasn't for real?
Oh, my God.

18:07.142 --> 18:08.109
No, wait, wait, wait!
I was worried!

18:08.143 --> 18:10.144
Worried about what?

18:10.179 --> 18:12.346
About you getting hurt.

18:12.347 --> 18:13.815
I don't want your daughters
growing up without a dad.

18:13.816 --> 18:15.450
I know what that's like,
and it sucks.

18:15.451 --> 18:16.751
And I don't want it
to happen to them.

18:16.785 --> 18:18.486
Why didn't you just
say something to me?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.288
Because I didn't want
to get in your head

18:20.289 --> 18:22.723
and have you
freak out again.

18:22.724 --> 18:24.559
Yeah, I get it.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.127
It's been a rough year.

18:26.128 --> 18:29.697
But I've learned to embrace my
fears. It makes me a better cop.

18:29.731 --> 18:30.731
Tacs one and two are set.

18:30.732 --> 18:31.766
30 minutes until
the bogeys arrive.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.101
Thanks, Boyle.

18:33.102 --> 18:35.670
I love it when
you say "bogeys."

18:35.704 --> 18:36.871
So we good?

18:36.905 --> 18:39.474
We good.

18:39.475 --> 18:41.242
And for the record...

18:41.243 --> 18:43.544
If I could be any
kind of vacation...

18:43.545 --> 18:44.812
I'd be lake trip.

18:44.847 --> 18:46.147
Classic.

18:47.749 --> 18:48.749
You're here late.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.885
Ah, you know me.
I love working.

18:50.919 --> 18:52.653
Can't tear me
away from my work.

18:52.654 --> 18:56.624
I just love requisitions
and corporate record reports.

18:56.625 --> 19:00.027
Just, you know,
messages from people for Holt.

19:00.062 --> 19:02.730
I can imagine
how frightening this must be.

19:02.731 --> 19:04.132
I'm sorry we didn't
catch the guy.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.800
Yeah. It's weird.

19:05.801 --> 19:07.235
It's like,
why do the worst things

19:07.236 --> 19:09.470
always happen
to the best people?

19:09.471 --> 19:11.572
And what's to keep it
from happening again?

19:11.607 --> 19:14.075
We are. Come on.
We're taking you home.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.510
Really?

19:19.081 --> 19:21.415
We installed a second lock
on your front door,

19:21.450 --> 19:23.484
put locks on the windows
by the fire escape,

19:23.485 --> 19:24.752
and set all your lights
on timers.

19:24.786 --> 19:27.121
That makes me feel
so much better.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.189
Thank you, guys.

19:28.223 --> 19:30.358
And as a token
of my appreciation,

19:30.392 --> 19:33.561
I would like
to give you...

19:33.562 --> 19:34.561
These.

19:34.563 --> 19:36.531
Great.

19:36.565 --> 19:38.366
The cool thing is you can
eat whatever you want.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.868
These are right there
with you.

19:46.775 --> 19:47.942
Hey!

19:47.976 --> 19:49.777
You Vance Vandervaven?

19:49.811 --> 19:53.581
Yeah. That's me.
I'll be right there.

19:53.615 --> 19:54.615
You gonna let me
do this, man?

19:54.650 --> 19:55.917
What choice do I have?

19:55.918 --> 19:57.952
You hit me in the arms so hard
they no longer work.

19:57.986 --> 20:01.689
All right. It's time
to catch some bad guys.

20:01.690 --> 20:03.124
It good to be back.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.092
Have a fun steroid deal,
sergeant.

20:05.127 --> 20:06.460
You're a weird guy,
Jake.

20:06.495 --> 20:07.662
Yeah.

20:11.967 --> 20:14.101
The ebony falcon.
No.

20:14.136 --> 20:16.237
The ebony falcon
had no fear.

20:16.271 --> 20:18.506
He's the ebony antelope now.

20:18.507 --> 20:20.408
Brave enough
to drink at the lake,

20:20.409 --> 20:23.511
but wise enough
to run from the lions.

20:23.512 --> 20:25.746
Hey, my arms don't work.
Can you scratch my nose?

20:25.747 --> 20:28.115
You bet.
Mm-hmm.

20:28.116 --> 20:29.450
Yeah. Thank you.

20:30.986 --> 20:32.253
Morning, Captain.

20:32.287 --> 20:35.156
So? How did
sergeant Jeffries do?

20:35.190 --> 20:37.191
Why is everyone so worried
about the sarge?

20:37.192 --> 20:38.259
He was amazing.

20:38.260 --> 20:39.894
He made the buy,
took out the suppliers,

20:39.895 --> 20:41.935
but wisely didn't take on
more than he could handle.

20:41.964 --> 20:44.899
I left one for you.

20:44.933 --> 20:46.467
And you'll be happy to know

20:46.468 --> 20:48.336
that he punched me
in the face several times.

20:48.370 --> 20:49.470
That does make me happy.

20:49.504 --> 20:52.306
Guess we're being
candid today.

20:54.743 --> 20:55.977
Hey, sarge,

20:56.011 --> 20:57.478
just for the record,

20:57.479 --> 20:59.580
I hope you're on every case with
me for the rest of my career.

20:59.615 --> 21:01.983
I'm not scared
for you at all.

21:01.984 --> 21:03.251
Of you a lot.

21:03.285 --> 21:05.786
Thanks, Jake.

21:05.821 --> 21:08.756
Oh, Peralta,
I almost forgot.

21:08.757 --> 21:10.057
My girls made you a card.

21:10.092 --> 21:11.592
To thank you
for keeping me safe.

21:11.593 --> 21:13.394
Oh...

21:13.428 --> 21:15.463
They're so full
of potential.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.967
Why would you
show me this?
