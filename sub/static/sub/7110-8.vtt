WEBVTT

00:13.681 --> 00:15.449
Here. It's for the visas.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.424
Wowie, wowie.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.793
Ring the bell.
The queen is home.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.228
You walk over here like this

00:27.295 --> 00:29.330
and no one beat
the fuck out of you?

00:29.397 --> 00:30.998
You don't think that's
a little meshuggeh?

00:31.065 --> 00:33.134
Actually, I'm-- I'm fine.

00:33.201 --> 00:37.771
I have the transvestite pass.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.040
No one can arrest me.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.676
I am protected by the city.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.479
It actually says there
that I'm not meshuggeh.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.116
What's transvestite?
That's like faigele, right?

00:48.182 --> 00:51.185
No. Me. I'm--
I'm a transvestite.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.586
You look like
Aunt Esther in this.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.223
Magnus had the city
issue them to all of us.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.691
Who's Magnus?
He's your gay lover?

00:57.758 --> 01:01.229
- Uh, no. Uh, Magnus--
- I mean, not my gay lover.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.996
...the head of an institute
where Gittel works.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.633
You know, Ma, if you
got out more often,

01:05.699 --> 01:08.001
then you might not
hate Berlin so much.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.370
It's actually
quite a lovely city.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.038
I think it's a fantastic city.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.906
If it wasn't for all
the Germans living in it,

01:12.973 --> 01:14.175
it would be great.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.344
Chosa, I was hoping
tomorrow morning

01:16.410 --> 01:18.146
you would teach me
how to use the U-bahn

01:18.212 --> 01:19.213
like you've been saying.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.614
I'm afraid of the turnstile

01:20.681 --> 01:22.416
because I've been
hearing nonstop

01:22.483 --> 01:24.618
about how it's been
breaking women's pelvises.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.720
Did you hear
about Sheila's sister?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.789
She had to give birth
through her face.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.424
So stay home tonight,

01:30.491 --> 01:32.293
and tomorrow you can
finally teach me--

01:32.360 --> 01:34.928
I'm actually-- I can't
tomorrow morning.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.330
When are you
coming home, huh?

01:36.397 --> 01:38.166
I'm going to stay with--

01:38.199 --> 01:39.700
I'm going to stay
with Gittel.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.402
Stay here tonight,
Chosa, please.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.771
Stay-- Chosa, stay here.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.406
Stay here with Mommy.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.178
Bye, Mommy.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.344
Oh, my God,
what did you do?

02:23.411 --> 02:24.778
I know, I got more.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.349
No.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.219
L'chaim.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.920
Don't do that.
It makes me think of Dad.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.722
L'chaim.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.757
L'chai...
Anyone?

Sneaking in, sneaking out.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.442
I'm not sneaking.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.377
I could be dead, you know,

04:03.444 --> 04:05.579
lying in a gutter somewhere,

04:05.646 --> 04:07.981
maggots eating my eyeballs.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.216
You wouldn't even notice.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.484
Fucking morbid.

You're fucking morbid.

I got the visas.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.518
- What?
- I got the visas.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.852
All three of us.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.854
That's you.
Give it back to me.

05:53.921 --> 05:54.988
That one's yours.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.095
It says Ger Schoen.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.932
Do you have a visa
for Gittel?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.500
Your name is Ger Schoen.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.969
My name is Gittel.
You know my name
is Gittel.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.238
Okay. Today you're Gittel.
Tomorrow you can be Edith.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.040
After that, you can be
a fucking lobster.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.443
Change your name when you
get to America, please.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.277
I'm not leaving Magnus.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.946
Take me to this man.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.816
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.586
Ma: What did you do
to my boy?

06:25.653 --> 06:27.521
- Magnus: She goes by Gittel.
- Gittel?

06:27.588 --> 06:28.656
What a horrible name.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.057
It's the name she chose.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.860
So what is this, a circus?
A sex circus?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.495
- No.
- A zoo for fucking?

06:34.562 --> 06:35.829
Are you starting
a religious--

06:35.896 --> 06:38.198
No, I don't believe
in religion.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.467
A sex religion?

06:39.467 --> 06:42.503
I believe in...science.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.337
I believe in truth.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.907
I believe in reason,

06:46.974 --> 06:47.841

06:47.908 --> 06:49.943
Look. Look around.
Look around.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.212
You know, y--
you're in my library.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.482
You're next to my museum.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.485
You-- You're underneath
my medical ward.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.352
You make fun.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.489
This is the future!

07:10.263 --> 07:11.632
What's that?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.503
Ger Schoen's visa.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.305
When he changes his mind

07:18.371 --> 07:19.840
and he wants his mommy...

07:20.908 --> 07:22.510
you're going to hold that
for him

07:22.543 --> 07:24.978
and give it to him, okay?
Keep it safe, please.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.356
Wipe that stuff
off your face.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.159
Be home in an hour.
We have to pack,

07:39.226 --> 07:40.828
and we have to go.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.936
I mean, if you're
going to be a girl,

07:49.002 --> 07:50.771
cover your tits.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.574
Shameful.

Two reps, and we're done.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.613
This is what I like to see.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.414
From the hips.
Focus on the hips.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.082
All the way up.
All the way up.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.183
Come on, rookie.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.652
It's not about doing it
the way you want.

09:11.719 --> 09:12.886
It's about doing it right.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.056
You got plenty of time
to rest when we're done.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.859

we're going to be, huh?

Keep it moving.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.166
All right?
A little bit faster.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.636
You got a little bit
more in you, all right?

09:28.669 --> 09:29.670
[grunting]

09:29.737 --> 09:30.738
Looking better.
Looking better.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.939
That's what I'm
talking about.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.209
Well, so far for me,
the hardest thing
about the Jewish New Year

09:36.276 --> 09:40.047
by far is that I keep
writing 5775 on my checks.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.717
I'm pretty sure you used
that same joke in 5774.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.656
Okay.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.124
I don't want to start
a whole thing,

09:51.191 --> 09:53.126
but I'm keeping
a little bit in my head

09:53.193 --> 09:54.695
just about the--

09:55.729 --> 09:58.565
the talk.
The whole polyamory idea

09:58.666 --> 09:59.867
is freaking me out.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.101
Don't--
That's the wrong word.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.603
It's not about
other people at all.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.872
It's about me and you.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.875
It's about
how incredible this is

10:07.941 --> 10:10.143
and how amazing you are

10:10.210 --> 10:12.079
and how much
I love being with you

10:12.145 --> 10:16.616
and how, being with you,
I've become myself,

10:16.684 --> 10:18.418
and I-- and I want
to keep doing that

10:18.485 --> 10:20.921
and expanding and getting
closer and closer to that,

10:20.988 --> 10:23.957
and I know that I will
just start shutting down

10:24.024 --> 10:26.894
if we have to, you know,
make some commitment

10:26.960 --> 10:29.229
to-- to next year,
next month, or--

10:29.296 --> 10:32.265
A month? Is that hard
for you to think about?

10:32.332 --> 10:34.935
A whole month with me
or a week?

10:35.002 --> 10:37.137
Like tomorrow?
Like a day?

10:37.204 --> 10:39.239
That would be hard?
Or, like, you know,

10:39.306 --> 10:40.841
what's going to happen
in an hour?

10:40.908 --> 10:42.676
Are we going to be
going out in an hour,

10:42.743 --> 10:44.544
or is that, like,
too hard,

10:44.611 --> 10:46.714
- like, so locked in?
- Stop.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.215
You're
so locked in by me.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.349
Stop it. What? No.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.984
Of course tomorrow.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.653
I'm just-- But yes,
like, day to day.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.723
Why not? Why not...

10:55.789 --> 10:58.759
not burden us
with expectations and--

10:58.826 --> 11:00.093
Because
this isn't a burden.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.962
This is not a burden
for me.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.964
I can't do this way.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.899
I can't do this version.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.801
That's not who I am,
and you know that.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.036
So I'm not doing it.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.370
I'm not
going to the festival,

11:10.437 --> 11:11.538
and I'm not doing this.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.806
So figure it out.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.413
I don't know
where I belong here,

11:20.480 --> 11:22.816
but, uh, I know, you know,
I'd like to help.

11:22.883 --> 11:23.951
Well, there's a lot,
you know.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.585
We have a variety
of opportunities.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.653
Uh-huh.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.988
Uh, Crock Pot,

11:28.055 --> 11:30.190
which is sort of like
our queer Meals On Wheels.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.827
Oh, I don't think
I want to inflict my
cooking on shut-ins.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.796
How do you think you'd do
with crisis intervention?

11:35.863 --> 11:37.765
Well, I butt in a lot.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.900
I'm very good at that,
my children tell me.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.368
- Okay.
- Tell me more.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.836
Well, the Trevor Project.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.838
They're looking for people
for their late night shifts.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.807
- Uh-huh.
- It's intense, you know?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.408
It's mostly
suicidal teens.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.510
Wow. That's important.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.779
Yeah. And, you know,

11:51.845 --> 11:53.213
the people who do it,
the Life On Uppers,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.115
they go through a rigorous
training program.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.650
Mm. Is the graveyard
shift the only opening?

11:57.785 --> 11:59.119
We don't call it
the graveyard shift

11:59.186 --> 12:01.855
because of the, you know,
the nature of the calls.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.657
Right. Well, I wouldn't--
That's not something
I would say on the phone.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.326
I'm going to get you
an application.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.360
Okay.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.014
Oh. Sorry.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.818
Hi.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.452
I didn't know
you did yoga.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.187
Sorry.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.856
I do.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.557
What kind of yoga is it?

12:37.624 --> 12:38.959
It's called hatha.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.727
Well, I have hatha mind--

12:40.828 --> 12:42.062
Okay.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.469
- Davina--
- What do you want, Maura?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.472
I mean, is this
what we're going to do?

12:52.539 --> 12:53.841
Do you want me
to move out?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.943
Do you want me
to find other housing?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.277
Is this where we are?

12:57.344 --> 12:59.212
Are we going to be
friends again?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.281
I'm trying to change,
all right?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.284
I'm trying
to do the right thing.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.886
I mean, I'm here.
I'm volunteering

13:05.953 --> 13:07.354
for these people.
My God.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.621
Volunteering twice a week

13:08.688 --> 13:10.257
doesn't make you
Mother Teresa.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.959
I know that.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.861
Mother Teresa, by the way,

13:13.861 --> 13:16.897
was not a terribly
nice person.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.199
Flawed.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.211
Hello.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.245
Come in.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.281
In here.

come here.

Would you come over here
and smell this pepper?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.954
I think this stem
has stem rot.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.789
- Oh.
- Does it smell moldy?

13:42.890 --> 13:45.258
Looks like a stem to me.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.627
Let's see what's inside. Yes.

13:47.694 --> 13:50.597
Um, is Leslie here?
I just have a thing--

13:50.663 --> 13:52.665
Oh, sure. Bean! Hey, Bean!

13:52.732 --> 13:54.001
Do you live here?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.535
I thought
you lived next door.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.437
Oh, yeah. My stove's broken.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.139
- Bean!
- Leslie: What?

14:01.308 --> 14:02.642
Hi.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.911
Hey, there.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.047
Uh, um, I'm sorry.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.149
I just--
I have my essay for you.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.750
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Just--

14:10.817 --> 14:11.919
Just drop it right there,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.486
and I'll get around
to it.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.521
You know Bella.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.622
Hi.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.990
Hey.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.725
[Leslie chuckles]

14:18.791 --> 14:21.528
Let me take you
to your Uber, babe.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.196
Bye.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.568
She was kind of young, huh?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.337
You know, I kind of guess

14:30.403 --> 14:33.573
that Leslie harbors
a little disdain

14:33.640 --> 14:35.575
for the aging female body.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.710
So it seems
like the age gap

14:37.777 --> 14:39.012
just keeps getting bigger.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.280
I mean, the girls,
they just--

14:40.347 --> 14:41.581
they keep getting younger?

14:41.648 --> 14:43.650
Well, like, Leslie
keeps getting older,

14:43.716 --> 14:45.085
and they all stay 21.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.026
Hold up.
It's a complicated process

14:53.093 --> 14:55.195
to select
the correct tour van--

14:55.262 --> 14:56.496
- Oh, my God.
- That's crazy.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.364
...in order to haul

14:57.430 --> 14:58.966
your fussy little pusses
across--

14:58.966 --> 15:00.200
- How about this one?
- [Agnyss laughs]

15:00.267 --> 15:01.969
So where are we
going to go?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.770
Uh, as far away
as we can fucking--

15:03.836 --> 15:05.572
- Ooh.
- ...get from Los Angeles.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.074
Fuck, that's baller.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.044
Ooh-ooh!

15:11.111 --> 15:12.512
It's so good.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.248
Hop in.
See if this is the one.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.383
Whoo!

15:16.449 --> 15:19.286
This one-- This is like
we all have our own bed.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.055
Josh can sleep in the back
while I drive.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.024
- If you're sober.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.292
You're not driving.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.994
This is what
we're going to do.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.128
I'm going to put
little blankies.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.562
I'm going to
make little nests.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.564
And I'm going to feed you
little gummy worms as we go.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.100
- You're out of
your fucking mind.
- Ew!

15:33.166 --> 15:35.102
- How you folks doing?
- Oh, here he is.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.137
- Hi. Richard.
- Hi, Joshua Pfefferman.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.671
- How are you?
- I'm good.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.440
- Hi.
- Hey.
- My girls love this one.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.075
Yep. Pretty girls
need a pretty van.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.443
Yes, they do.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.212
Now, the base model on this
one starts at 39.5.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.879
So, right off the bat,

15:47.014 --> 15:48.315
what's the lowest
you can go?

15:48.381 --> 15:49.649
Just no fucking around.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.753
Um...I might be able
to swing, uh, 38.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.155
- No.
- But that's really--

15:55.222 --> 15:57.524
That's as low as I can go
without losing my job.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.625
38? Okay.

15:58.691 --> 15:59.659
Uh, where you from?

15:59.726 --> 16:00.860
Encino. You?

16:01.028 --> 16:02.329
Pacific Palisades.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.230
Really?

16:03.296 --> 16:04.731
We got two Cali boys here.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.299
- Two Cali boys!
- There we go.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.800
That's what I'm
talking about.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.469
What can you do for
a fellow Angelino?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.738
Because I think you can
do better than 38.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.540
I know you can do
better than 38.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.641
I-- I really can't.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.675
Like 32.

16:15.742 --> 16:16.843
[snapping fingers]

16:16.909 --> 16:18.111
Okay.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.679
That's physically
not possible.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.813
Treinta y dos.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.250
Right? Right? Right?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.086
You will sell me
this van for $32,000.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.587
I know you need
this commission,

16:27.654 --> 16:30.757
and if you don't,
I'm going to walk away.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.559
Owned and fucking poned.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.827
All right,
who's got a license?

16:34.894 --> 16:36.129
Yes.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.131
See you back at
the studio, all right?

16:38.198 --> 16:41.668
Last one to the studio
buys Pinkberry.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.139
Motherfucker.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.179
Ali: And then Syd bailed,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.914
and now I have to go
to Idyllwild all by myself.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.883
Isn't that Leslie
woman there?

16:56.949 --> 16:59.486
Yeah, but that's exactly why
I don't want to go by myself.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.589
I don't want to seem like
one of her little groupies.

17:02.655 --> 17:06.593
You should see this
little baby bird little--

17:06.659 --> 17:09.196
excommunicated
from the Mormon Church

17:09.262 --> 17:12.099
coming out of her bedroom
all fucked into oblivion

17:12.099 --> 17:13.566
like a--

17:13.633 --> 17:15.168
Oh, my God.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.669
Isn't she old?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.138
She is older.

17:18.205 --> 17:21.808
She is extremely sexy,
very smart,

17:21.874 --> 17:23.276
and I really,
really like her,

17:23.343 --> 17:25.478
and I think that I'm
too old for her.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.815
I'm not kidding.
She likes them real little.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.483
I got to meet this woman.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.486
Oh, my God.
Come with me to Idyllwild.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.788
You can meet her, and then
I don't have to go alone.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.490
No. I can't. I can't.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.761
I got the cable guy coming
to install the bigger TV.

17:41.828 --> 17:45.465
Do you hear the words that are
coming out of your mouth?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.236
In case you didn't,
the cable guy

17:49.302 --> 17:52.839
coming to install
the bigger TV.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.141
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.275
Shelly: Hi!

17:55.342 --> 17:57.043
- Wow.
- Hello.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.145
This place looks great.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.380
Yeah. Isn't this amazing?

18:00.447 --> 18:01.781
Looks like we're
in Key West.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.883
- That makes sense.
- Very festive, Mom.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.785
1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.220
Is Josh coming?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.556
No. I, uh, I invited him,

18:09.622 --> 18:12.159
but he's still
a little depressed.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.826
Yeah. So am I.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.995
I thought Raquel
was going to be
my sister-in-law.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.430
- It's awful.
- It's tragic.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.366
We all thought it was
gonna work out differently.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.800
Is that
a margarita machine?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.535
Yes, Buzzy bought it for me.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.204
- Hi, Buz.
- Hey, girls.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.438
Wow, a new grill.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.174
Yes, he bought that
for me, too.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.576
He loves his meat.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.977
I love his meat.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.945
Oh, Mom, ew.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.614
Can I get
one of these?

18:34.681 --> 18:35.815
Yeah, in a minute.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.184
I made the plates
too small.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.751
I have to do
with my finger.

18:38.818 --> 18:39.986
Did he move in?

18:40.052 --> 18:43.456
He lives on a houseboat
on Lake Havasu,

18:43.523 --> 18:46.759
and the commute was
getting to be too much,

18:46.826 --> 18:49.996
so he has a drawer.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.098
I don't know how
to work this yet. Here.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.434
Oh, a yellow watermelon.
This is very exotic.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.835
I knew
you'd like that.

18:55.902 --> 18:56.969
Thanks for bringing this.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.905
I wonder if this
is an aphrodisiac.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.673
Whoo, I hope so.

19:05.545 --> 19:09.115
I just feel like
no one understands me.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.550
Well, I felt like that,

19:10.617 --> 19:12.118
and I know
what you're saying.

19:12.219 --> 19:16.256
You know, there's always
darkness before the--

19:16.323 --> 19:17.690
the storm? Dawn?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.559
And I'm dead.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.728
- This is hard.
- I know.

19:21.794 --> 19:22.729
It's really hard.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.896
I know. It's okay, though.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.265
You just have to get in there

19:25.332 --> 19:27.334
and intercept
what they're feeling.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.236
They're-- They're about
to harm themselves.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.404
You have to keep them
from harming themselves.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.305
Okay.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.606
- Okay?
- Yeah.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.608
This is harder
than I thought.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.344
[writing]

19:38.778 --> 19:40.680
I've had those thoughts.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.250
This is you.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.585
Oh, my God.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.819
Suicide and--

19:48.455 --> 19:51.157
Sometimes I just feel
like it would be easier

19:51.258 --> 19:54.594
is I just wasn't here.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.263
When was this?

19:58.064 --> 20:01.000
Uh, freshman year
of high school,

20:01.067 --> 20:04.304
sophomore year-- Hmm.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.540
All of high school
and into college.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.377
Pretty much until
about three years ago

20:10.443 --> 20:12.845
when, uh, I don't know.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.615
I guess I still have my days.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.749
Still?

20:18.285 --> 20:19.419
Now you listen to me.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.787
If you ever
have those thoughts,

20:20.853 --> 20:21.988
you call me, all right?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.991
I mean, even the slightest
thought like that,

20:25.057 --> 20:26.993
I mean, really,
you call me

20:27.059 --> 20:28.495
because I'll come over,

20:28.561 --> 20:31.197
and I'll tell you how
fantastic and wonderful

20:31.264 --> 20:34.100
and unique and what
a gorgeous soul you are

20:34.166 --> 20:36.503
and what a crappy,
fucked-up world

20:36.569 --> 20:38.137
this would be without you.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.806
Do you understand me?

20:48.014 --> 20:50.016
You're such a good mom.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.490
Okay, who likes them bloody?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.359
- Ooh!
- Let's go, let's go.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.927
- They're perfect.
- Wow.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.962
That is a lot of meat.

21:03.029 --> 21:03.996
A lot of meat.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.432
Does that say something?

21:05.498 --> 21:07.400
An artist always
signs his work.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.337
Wow. "Buzzy meat."

21:10.370 --> 21:12.472
Yeah, yeah.
It's from Sky Mall.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.941
They have all kinds
of nifty gadgets there.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.743
Do you want one?
I can get you one.

21:16.809 --> 21:20.347
Okay, everybody,
you are looking...

21:20.413 --> 21:23.182
at the new president
of the condo board.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.117
- Wow.
- Yeah, hurray.

21:25.184 --> 21:28.187
It was a landslide
victory.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.822
- But guess what.
- What?

21:29.889 --> 21:32.224
After the first meeting,

21:32.359 --> 21:34.193
I wanted to quit.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.796
Yeah. Sitting around listening
to a bunch of alte kochers

21:36.863 --> 21:40.400
talk about what color they
should paint the facackteh
speed bumps.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.401
[speaking Yiddish]

21:41.468 --> 21:43.002
So Buzzy says to me--

21:43.069 --> 21:45.738
So I told her you need to do
what you want in this life,

21:45.805 --> 21:48.274
not what you feel like
you should be doing.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.709
Just quit.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.478
- Just quit.
- Just quit.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.480
So you quit after
the first meeting?

21:53.546 --> 21:55.181
Yes. Tell them
about the cruise.

21:55.247 --> 21:58.150
I'm taking your mother
on a five-day Alaskan cruise.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.186
Five days.
And you know what?

22:00.252 --> 22:01.888
If you look in the brochure,

22:01.954 --> 22:04.657
there is a picture
of a buffet--

22:04.724 --> 22:06.893
you know the raw bar buffet--

22:06.959 --> 22:09.462
with clams, oysters,

22:09.529 --> 22:12.532
uh, sh-shrimp
the size of your arm,

22:12.599 --> 22:15.435
and-- and-- and scallops
the size of footballs.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.037
And it's all--
it's all for free.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.972
Okay, you know what?
I got to go wash my hands.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.442
- Ali: Yeah, I got to pee.
- Where are you going?

22:26.913 --> 22:29.248
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.818
What is that person?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.853
I don't understand.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.321
That's a plant.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.523
These aren't real.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.157
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.526
It's real, and it's alive.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.193
Oh, my God. She's--

22:41.260 --> 22:42.629
she's fucking
watering plants?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.130
There's a clean faucet.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.432
She's in limerence.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.266
It is so clean in here.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.568
She's in limerence.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.236
She's in what?

22:50.302 --> 22:51.237
Limerence.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.439
What's limerence?

22:52.439 --> 22:53.740
Puppy love, early days.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.442
It makes you clean
your cabinets?

22:55.508 --> 22:57.343
She got a bidet.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.579
Oh, my God,
I love those things.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.648
It's so clean and neat
and organized.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.583
These are, like, $500.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.518
I guess Buzzy likes
his taint cleaned.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.654
It's got pulsate, oscillate--

23:07.720 --> 23:09.155
Where is all the shit?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.790
...high, medium, low.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.625
Cold, hot.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.761
Where's my Kleenex
cozy I made for her

23:14.827 --> 23:15.862
in fifth grade? I can't--

23:15.928 --> 23:17.163
- [water gushing]
- [gasp]

23:17.229 --> 23:18.565
Oh, my God.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.801
She threw away my
needlepoint Kleenex cozy?

23:21.868 --> 23:22.702
Mom!

23:22.769 --> 23:25.337
This is so warm and wet.

23:25.472 --> 23:28.374
Als. Als, close the door.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.476
What?

23:29.509 --> 23:31.077
Close the fucking door.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.182
I gave it all
to the Hadassah League.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.717
I got rid of all those boxes

23:37.784 --> 23:40.252
of moldy clothes
and toys in the garage, too.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.954
I-- I can breathe.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.524
Mama, my artwork
was in those boxes.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.592
What artwork?

23:45.658 --> 23:46.759
All my old artwork

23:46.826 --> 23:48.160
from my freshman year
at Bard.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.062
My-- My paintings
and my collage

23:50.129 --> 23:51.330
and my video pieces.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.965
Buzzy says

23:53.032 --> 23:56.235
that if you hold an item
in your hand

23:56.302 --> 23:58.370
and it doesn't give you joy,

23:58.505 --> 24:00.006
you should get rid of it.

24:01.841 --> 24:05.945
I didn't want to be like
one of those hoarders on
television.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.146
See?

24:07.213 --> 24:08.748
Jesus, Mom.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.750
Everything is gone.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.985
You didn't want to keep
anything, Mom?

24:13.052 --> 24:14.420
Nothing?

24:14.521 --> 24:16.022
None of the artwork
I made for you as a kid?

24:16.088 --> 24:18.257
What about the painting
of you holding that baby?

24:18.324 --> 24:20.960
That painting
did not give me joy.

24:21.027 --> 24:24.797
It was very unattractive.
I looked so angry.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.633
Whose baby
was that anyway?

24:26.699 --> 24:29.636
It was a symbolic baby, Mom.
It was a painting.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.738
Well, anyway,
I've been telling you kids

24:31.804 --> 24:33.005
to come pick up
your stuff for months.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.207
- Uch.
- I am not a storage facility.

24:35.274 --> 24:38.410
Your father is the one
with the enormous house.

24:38.545 --> 24:41.213
[loud groan]

24:41.280 --> 24:42.582
[scoff]

24:44.183 --> 24:46.719
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm,
mm-mm.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.722
- Buzz?
- Yeah.

24:49.789 --> 24:50.990
You need some help?

24:51.057 --> 24:52.124
Not really. My--

24:52.191 --> 24:54.093
our mom threw out
all of our stuff,

24:54.160 --> 24:56.896
- so we're just looking for it.
- Oh.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.400
Could you be a little
gentle, please? Just--

25:01.568 --> 25:02.602
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.170
Good hunting.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.605
Okay. Thanks.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.707
You know, I could
have been a painter.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.075
Probably should have
been a painter.

25:09.141 --> 25:13.112
My teacher said I had
unusual raw talent.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.082
Someone gave
their Bible away.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.985
You think
they lost faith?

25:19.051 --> 25:20.186
I'm losing faith

25:20.252 --> 25:22.254
that we're ever going
to find our stuff.

25:22.321 --> 25:23.623
I need to start
doing something,

25:23.690 --> 25:25.692
something bigger than myself,

25:25.758 --> 25:27.860
anything, just something
really big.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.929
Really?
Something really big?

25:29.996 --> 25:35.234
Like a really big
music festival

25:35.301 --> 25:37.369
in a big forest

25:37.436 --> 25:41.273
full of big vaginas
and big fires

25:41.340 --> 25:45.244
and big hugs
from your sister?

25:45.311 --> 25:46.713
Josh:
Look at this traffic.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.848
They time it out so you
can't get anywhere.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.950
It's a fucking conspiracy
is what it is.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.785
Come on, motherfucker.
Come on!

25:52.852 --> 25:54.754
- [honk]
- Josh, for real.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.488
If I could go around him
I would,

25:56.623 --> 25:57.924
- but this bitch with--
- Chill out.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.458
...the fucking children
in the car is fucking with me.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.828
- [honk]
- What the fuck
is wrong with them?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.429
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

26:03.495 --> 26:04.797
You're being a dick,
Josh.

26:04.864 --> 26:05.965
- Fucker!
- Relax!

26:06.032 --> 26:07.366
- [honk]
- Oh, my God.

26:07.433 --> 26:08.534
You're so embarrassing.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.637
Fucking go,
you piece of shit!

26:10.703 --> 26:11.738
You're freaking me out!

26:11.804 --> 26:13.472
They're
fucking boxing me in!

26:13.539 --> 26:15.842
- [honk]
- Oh, my God, stop it!

26:15.908 --> 26:19.311
Seriously, what is
happening to you?

26:20.980 --> 26:22.381
I think
you should pull over.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.083
Ohh...

26:27.486 --> 26:29.288
[panting]

26:33.726 --> 26:36.195
Josh?
Are you all right?

26:37.429 --> 26:39.065
[panting]

26:39.131 --> 26:40.432
I don't know.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.068
I don't know.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.670
I don't know.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.886
Do you think a bear
can work this zipper?

26:59.952 --> 27:00.887
Yes.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.188
- Really?
- Yes, you know.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.489
They prefer knobs,

27:03.555 --> 27:04.691
but they like
a good zipper.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.925
Oh, you're just a jerk.

27:05.992 --> 27:06.759
Hello.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.894
- Moppa.
- Hi.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.228
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.097
What's going on?
What is all this?

27:11.163 --> 27:13.165
We're going to Idyllwild
Womyn's Music Festival.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.133
We're camping.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.735
We're checking out
our new gear.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.370
It's Womyn.
Womyn's Festival with a Y.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.706
That's wonderful.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.073
We're going to drink
and dance

27:21.140 --> 27:22.174
and shake our tits
in the wind.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.076
- [gasp] Is that it?
- Yes.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.545
- It just came.
- What is that?

27:26.612 --> 27:28.180
Oh, it's a, uh,
it's a service

27:28.247 --> 27:30.717
that regenders
childhood photos.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.018
- Come over here.
- Sarah: Really?

27:32.084 --> 27:33.820
That's so cool. Let's see.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.421
You, like,
send your pictures in?

27:35.487 --> 27:36.889
Of course. Now look.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.725
Wait a second.
Can you wait?

27:40.226 --> 27:41.293
Hold on, hold on.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.162
- [gasp]
- Mm.

27:43.229 --> 27:47.099
Oh, my God, look.
They put a bow
in your hair.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.401
It's so beautiful
what they do.

27:49.468 --> 27:50.803
Look, look.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.238
- [gasp]
- Oh, my God.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.173
Sarah: Oh. Is that
your bar mitzvah?

27:54.240 --> 27:57.076
God, just imagine if you
could have been her

27:57.143 --> 27:58.177
your whole life.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.079
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.349
Then I would be shaking
my tits in the wilderness...

28:07.519 --> 28:08.855
with my daughters.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.324
** [rock guitar]

28:12.391 --> 28:14.326
- Maura, Sarah: Yeah.
- Ali: Yeah.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.327
All right.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.929
*Well, darkness
has a hunger *

28:16.996 --> 28:18.530
* That's insatiable *

28:18.597 --> 28:19.766
* Insatiable *

28:19.799 --> 28:21.600
*And lightness has a call *

28:21.667 --> 28:22.935
*That's hard to hear *

28:23.002 --> 28:24.536
* Hard to hear *

28:24.603 --> 28:26.405
*I wrap my fear
around me *

28:26.472 --> 28:29.208
- *Like a blanket *
- * A blanket *

28:29.275 --> 28:31.377
*I sailed my ship to safety *

28:31.443 --> 28:33.946
- *Till I sank it *
- * I sank it *

28:34.013 --> 28:36.215
*I'm crawlin'
on your shores *

28:36.282 --> 28:41.387
*I went to the doctor,
I went to the mountains *

28:41.453 --> 28:46.292
*I looked to the children,
I drank from the fountains *

28:46.358 --> 28:50.329
*There's more than one answer
to these questions *

28:50.396 --> 28:53.432
*Pointing me
in a crooked line *

28:53.499 --> 28:55.701
*And unless
I seek my source *

28:55.802 --> 28:57.703
*From some definitive *

28:57.804 --> 29:02.508
*Closer I am to God, yeah *

29:02.574 --> 29:06.378
* Closer I am to God *

29:06.445 --> 29:08.180
* Yeah *

29:08.247 --> 29:13.185
*I sent to see
the doctor of philosophy *

29:13.252 --> 29:15.187
* With a poster of Rasputin *

29:15.254 --> 29:18.057
*And a beard
down to his knee *

29:18.124 --> 29:20.827
*He never did marry *

29:20.827 --> 29:23.162
* Or see the great movie *

29:23.229 --> 29:25.364
*He graded my performance *

29:25.431 --> 29:27.399
*He said he could
see through me *

29:27.466 --> 29:31.003
*I spent four years

29:31.070 --> 29:34.140
*Got my paper,

29:35.274 --> 29:37.977
*I went to the doctor *

29:38.044 --> 29:40.079

29:40.146 --> 29:42.581
