00:06.101 --> 00:08.092
It's a jungle out there.

00:16.901 --> 00:18.812
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.941 --> 00:38.818
It's a jungle out there.

00:55.781 --> 00:57.981
Of all the murders
in the gangland war,

00:58.016 --> 01:00.226
Australians most remember Jason's -

01:00.261 --> 01:02.861
the one in front of the kids
at the footy clinic.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.986
It shocked the nation.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.621
The police now found themselves
under immense pressure

01:07.656 --> 01:09.066
to prove to the public

01:09.101 --> 01:11.661
that they had the control
of the streets of Melbourne.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.181
In response, Purana
was given everything.

01:14.216 --> 01:16.826
Failure would no longer be an option.

01:16.861 --> 01:18.786
Inspector!
Inspector Butterworth!

01:18.821 --> 01:20.826
Are you any closer
to an arrest, Garry?

01:20.861 --> 01:23.066
Any comment, Garry?
What's the progress, Garry?

01:23.101 --> 01:26.681
On behalf of Taskforce Purana, I just
want to assure the Victorian public

01:26.716 --> 01:30.261
that we are doing everything possible
to solve these series of murders.

01:30.296 --> 01:32.301
Do you have any idea
who's behind it, Garry?

01:32.336 --> 01:33.826
I make no further comment.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.681
Shit, Garry, there's been
21 murders, mate.

01:35.716 --> 01:38.168
Who's running this State -
you or them?

01:38.203 --> 01:40.586
What if it was
your family, Garry?

01:40.621 --> 01:42.541
Come on, Garry.
Garry, further comments?

01:42.576 --> 01:44.259
How many more people, mate?

01:48.301 --> 01:50.701
From this day forward,
whenever we go out,

01:50.736 --> 01:52.546
we will have our coats buttoned up

01:52.581 --> 01:56.341
and we will wear these Purana ties
knotted sharply.

01:56.376 --> 01:59.226
We will be a strong
and confident team,

01:59.261 --> 02:02.066
and the public and the crims
both have to know that.

02:02.101 --> 02:05.541
We will no longer be rattled by
a bunch of psychotic hooligans.

02:05.576 --> 02:09.226
We will be in control
and we will be effective.

02:09.261 --> 02:11.821
We're gonna start locking
these idiots up right now.

02:11.856 --> 02:13.626
The whole country is watching us

02:13.661 --> 02:15.941
and they do not think
we will get the job done

02:15.976 --> 02:18.261
but we WILL get the job done.

02:18.296 --> 02:19.706
We have to -

02:19.741 --> 02:21.746
lawfully and efficiently.

02:21.781 --> 02:24.541
Ladies and gentlemen, we need a win.

02:30.781 --> 02:32.426
Willie Thompson -

02:32.461 --> 02:36.021
Iollipop vendor, former kickboxer,
sometimes bouncer

02:36.056 --> 02:37.621
who was there the night
Berlozzi was murdered.

02:37.656 --> 02:39.066
And according to the phone traffic,

02:39.101 --> 02:41.901
he was sitting on 700 litres
of pseudoephedrine.

02:41.936 --> 02:43.741
Has there been
a lot of phone traffic?

02:43.776 --> 02:44.786
Yeah, huge.

02:44.821 --> 02:48.021
Every crim in Melbourne's calling
10 others to find out who did it.

02:48.056 --> 02:50.933
Mwah!

02:52.101 --> 02:54.081
Thank you.
Cheers, mate.

02:54.116 --> 02:56.061
Hey, what's your name, son?

02:56.096 --> 02:57.626
Uh, Keith.
Keith.

02:57.661 --> 03:00.221
You know who I am?
Yeah.

03:00.256 --> 03:02.146
Good.

03:02.181 --> 03:04.301
Keep the change, eh?

03:04.336 --> 03:05.973
$100?

03:07.541 --> 03:09.452
Thanks, Mr Mokbel.
Have a nice day.

03:12.221 --> 03:15.061
You should be ashamed of yourself.

03:15.096 --> 03:16.506
Why's that?

03:16.541 --> 03:18.841
You, flashing your money around
like a drunken sailor.

03:18.876 --> 03:21.106
What's the use of making it
if you don't enjoy it?

03:21.141 --> 03:23.621
Do you realise the next person
who doesn't tip him 93 bucks

03:23.656 --> 03:25.066
he's gonna treat like shit?

03:25.101 --> 03:26.701
It's not about them, baby.
It's about me.

03:26.736 --> 03:29.141
Oh. Oh, well, that's OK, then.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.378
Yeah.

03:30.413 --> 03:31.580
It is OK.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.266
Oh, fuck.
What?

03:36.301 --> 03:39.501
Fuck. They shot a mate of mine.

03:39.536 --> 03:40.986
Willie Thompson.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.501
They shot him dead in the street.

03:42.536 --> 03:44.266
Was he a good friend?

03:44.301 --> 03:46.541
I went to school with him.

03:46.576 --> 03:48.026
Shit, he...

03:48.061 --> 03:51.341
<i>... he used to stick up for me
in the yard and that, you know, so...</i>

03:51.376 --> 03:53.861
<i>... I used to let him cheat off me.</i>

03:53.896 --> 03:55.506
Those pricks.

03:55.541 --> 03:58.374
Fuckin' hell.

04:04.181 --> 04:06.821
Hey, it's me.
You heard about Willie?

04:06.856 --> 04:08.426
Yeah, the bastards killed him.

04:08.461 --> 04:11.506
Yeah, bloody oath.
He was a top bloke.

04:11.541 --> 04:15.600
Listen, listen - you hear anything,
right, you get back to me.

04:15.635 --> 04:19.659
Hey, did anyone know Willie Thompson
was a mate of Mokbel's?

04:22.301 --> 04:24.261
Here we go.
Oh, here he is.

04:24.296 --> 04:25.746
Carl!
Carl!

04:25.781 --> 04:27.441
What was your relationship...
G'day!

04:27.476 --> 04:29.088
How well did you know Mr Thompson?

04:29.123 --> 04:30.666
Oh, I only met him a few times,

04:30.701 --> 04:32.541
but, you know,
he seemed like a lovely bloke.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.026
Why do you think
he was murdered?

04:34.061 --> 04:36.721
Oh, I got no idea, mate.
Yeah, you should ask Purana.

04:36.756 --> 04:39.381
They got, like, 70 cops
working on this thing now.

04:39.416 --> 04:40.941
They should be keeping
the streets safe

04:40.976 --> 04:42.226
for an honest businessman like me.

04:42.261 --> 04:44.941
You know what I'm saying?
What is your business, Carl?

04:44.976 --> 04:48.021
Oh, um, I'm a property developer.

04:48.056 --> 04:50.489
Yeah.

04:52.421 --> 04:54.626
Carl's the one. He's behind it.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.261
Even though he's best mates
with Mokbel

04:56.296 --> 04:57.826
and Mokbel is good mates
with Willie?

04:57.861 --> 05:00.266
Carl is behind everything.
Keep an open mind.

05:00.301 --> 05:03.341
I keep telling you, this is not gonna
stop unless you lock Carl up.

05:03.376 --> 05:05.986
And Carl and Benji
both know they're hot?

05:06.021 --> 05:09.581
Yep. Look - cars, phones, home.
They know we're listening to them.

05:09.616 --> 05:11.026
And these two arseholes don't?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.346
That's right.
But he must know, surely?

05:13.381 --> 05:16.181
No, the guy's a bloody fruit loop.
He thinks we haven't gone near him.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.906
In his mind, he's been too smart for us.
He's off the radar.

05:18.941 --> 05:22.661
OK, well, if he is part of Williams' crew,
he will be asked to offend again.

05:22.696 --> 05:24.621
Providing he doesn't realise
we're on his tail,

05:24.656 --> 05:26.426
that's our chance to catch him
in the act.

05:26.461 --> 05:29.541
And if we can get him,
if we can just get one of 'em,

05:29.576 --> 05:31.372
we'll have our foot in the door.

05:33.861 --> 05:35.817
Oh, I like this one.

05:38.581 --> 05:41.573
Yeah!

05:43.101 --> 05:45.541
Can I keep it on for
a couple of minutes at least?

05:45.576 --> 05:47.541
You can keep it on all night
if you like,

05:47.576 --> 05:49.021
as long as your
knickers are off.

05:49.056 --> 05:50.466
Come on, Tigey.

05:50.501 --> 05:52.501
Let's just sit down
and talk for a while, huh?

05:52.536 --> 05:54.301
I just wanna wear it for a bit.

05:54.336 --> 05:55.814
Please?

05:56.861 --> 05:58.741
Babe, please?

05:58.776 --> 06:00.586
I'm serious.

06:00.621 --> 06:03.738
Ow! Alright, alright,
alright, alright! OK, wait.

06:06.981 --> 06:08.460
Undo it for me.

06:09.541 --> 06:13.881
# Where's my bodyguard,
bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard?

06:13.916 --> 06:18.247
# Where's my bodyguard, bodyguard,
bodyguard, bodyguard?

06:18.282 --> 06:22.578
# Be my bodyguard,
bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard... #

06:34.341 --> 06:37.381
Oh, Tigey, come on! Come on!

06:39.581 --> 06:41.106
Is there anything else on?

06:41.141 --> 06:43.341
Oh, yeah!
Fuckin' fuck me!

06:44.821 --> 06:47.061
You don't understand!
Fuckin' right I don't.

06:47.096 --> 06:48.506
Yeah, it's alright for you but!

06:48.541 --> 06:50.941
I get my legs waxed
'cause I got fuckin' hairs on them.

06:50.976 --> 06:53.466
I'm not payin' $40
for you to get a wax

06:53.501 --> 06:55.741
when you haven't got any hairs
there in the first place!

06:55.776 --> 06:56.706
You're so stupid!

06:56.741 --> 06:58.946
You want $40, you go and you tidy
and you vacuum.

06:58.981 --> 07:01.221
Then you do whatever the fuck
you want with it, alright?

07:01.256 --> 07:03.586
Right, you owe me!
I what?

07:03.621 --> 07:06.374
I owe you a bloody headache,
you slut!

07:08.141 --> 07:09.981
God, she drives me
up the wall sometimes.

07:10.016 --> 07:11.426
I could kill her.

07:11.461 --> 07:14.341
You know what it'll be, though.
She's gonna want a Brazilian.

07:15.861 --> 07:17.746
I suppose she might
have some hairs down there.

07:17.781 --> 07:20.181
She hasn't let me in the bathroom
for the past year and a half.

07:20.216 --> 07:21.626
Yeah, that's what it'll be.

07:21.661 --> 07:24.101
She probably doesn't wanna say
anything in case I go ape-shit

07:24.136 --> 07:26.541
about her letting some boy
cop a feel behind the toilets.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.386
If only she knew, eh?

07:29.421 --> 07:31.457
Hey, you'd like the hairless look,
wouldn't you?

07:33.301 --> 07:34.859
You ever done anal?

07:35.941 --> 07:39.021
The number of times
I've been asked that. No!

07:39.056 --> 07:41.261
Mine's got an exit sign on it, alright?

07:41.296 --> 07:43.226
It's a great feeling.

07:43.261 --> 07:45.941
The ultimate fucking feeling
of power when you're the doer.

07:45.976 --> 07:48.614
Doing who? Guys or girls?

07:49.741 --> 07:51.746
Nah! Sorry.

07:51.781 --> 07:54.941
Me myself, personally,
I just don't get anal sex.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.818
It must hurt like buggery.

07:58.541 --> 08:00.621
Did she really just say that?

08:00.656 --> 08:02.461
Where's Carl?

08:02.496 --> 08:04.106
Oh, search me.

08:04.141 --> 08:07.656
You might as well
ask Purana. They probably know.

08:08.781 --> 08:11.421
All I know is he told me
he was going for a walk.

08:13.301 --> 08:15.781
Probably got a new girlfriend,
for all I know.

08:15.816 --> 08:18.226
The stroppy one's not gonna
be down for hours now,

08:18.261 --> 08:21.426
so it's just you and me...
if you want to do something.

08:21.461 --> 08:25.661
Dhakota's napping but, so,
you know, just can't be too loud.

08:25.696 --> 08:28.300
Really?

08:30.981 --> 08:32.972
Don't these people do anything else?

08:35.301 --> 08:37.241
Went back a long way, Willie and me.

08:37.275 --> 08:39.145
I'm very upset about this, Carl.

08:39.181 --> 08:40.780
We went to high school
together, you know.

08:40.816 --> 08:42.785
Yeah?

08:42.821 --> 08:46.655
It just so happens...
I think I know who did it.

08:48.501 --> 08:49.456
Yeah?

08:50.861 --> 08:52.294
Michael Marshall.

08:53.461 --> 08:54.941
You blokes heard of him?

08:54.976 --> 08:57.546
Nah.
No.

08:57.581 --> 08:59.492
Nah, me either.

09:00.661 --> 09:03.961
Apparently he owed Willie
a shitload of cash, you know?

09:03.996 --> 09:06.948
And when he couldn't pay him,
he figured he'd take him out.

09:06.983 --> 09:09.901
Take out the bloke he owed
the money to, sort out the debt.

09:09.936 --> 09:11.221
Bastard.
What a prick.

09:11.256 --> 09:12.654
Prick.

09:22.861 --> 09:24.546
He's got it all wrong, hasn't he?

09:24.581 --> 09:26.941
Completely.
You... you organised Willie.

09:26.976 --> 09:29.386
Yep.
So who's Michael Marshall?

09:29.421 --> 09:32.986
Who cares?
Point is we've gotta get rid of him.

09:33.021 --> 09:35.866
If Tony finds out I offed Willie
then we're all stuffed.

09:35.901 --> 09:38.481
So we get Marshall, we'll let him
keep thinkin' it was Marshall.

09:38.516 --> 09:41.061
Why did you knock Willie Thompson
if he was a mate of Tony's?

09:41.096 --> 09:43.774
Didn't know he was a mate of Tony's.
Jesus, Carl!

09:43.809 --> 09:46.453
He had 700 litres of pseudoephedrine,
for God's sake.

09:47.981 --> 09:50.861
Look, fellas, I am making the gear.
I am the bank.

09:50.896 --> 09:52.386
We're rolling the dice

09:52.421 --> 09:54.746
on a billion-dollar-a-year
amphet trade here,

09:54.781 --> 09:58.821
so if we let some shit like this
worry us, then we're all fucked.

09:58.856 --> 10:00.266
A hundred G's each for the job.

10:00.301 --> 10:03.054
He's right, mate. Who gives a fuck?
Let's just find him and off him.

10:10.621 --> 10:13.089
That him?
Yep.

10:14.221 --> 10:17.581
Sells hot dogs all night outside
that nightclub in Exhibition Street.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.981
Gets home around now most mornings.

10:20.016 --> 10:22.026
Oh, yeah, hot dogs, eh?

10:22.061 --> 10:24.346
And he owns a house in South Yarra.

10:24.381 --> 10:27.214
Yeah.
Don't think it's just hot dogs.

10:28.621 --> 10:30.339
So what do you wanna do?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.421
I reckon we should drive around
for a little bit.

10:33.456 --> 10:35.661
Just get a feel for things.

10:35.696 --> 10:37.652
Yeah, OK.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.493
Good morning.
Morning.

10:54.781 --> 10:56.226
They on the move?

10:56.261 --> 10:58.981
Yeah, they're just
going around the block.

10:59.016 --> 11:01.346
What, at South Yarra?

11:01.381 --> 11:05.421
Yeah. Chapel Street, Toorak Road.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.935
Nup, they've stopped again.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.666
What do you think about this?

11:31.701 --> 11:34.141
Yeah, we don't know when
he leaves or anything, eh?

11:34.176 --> 11:35.574
Nup.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.746
I'll take you home if you like.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.941
I might come back,
wait around for a while.

11:40.976 --> 11:42.421
See what happens, eh?

11:42.456 --> 11:44.139
Alright.

11:46.421 --> 11:49.221
Hey. What are they up to?

11:49.256 --> 11:50.946
Well, you tell us.

11:50.981 --> 11:53.346
They get up at 5am,
they drive to South Yarra,

11:53.381 --> 11:56.661
they go round and round a few blocks
for about half an hour or so.

11:56.696 --> 11:59.941
Then they stop for 15 minutes,
and then they go round and round again.

11:59.976 --> 12:02.266
South Yarra?
Yep.

12:02.301 --> 12:04.261
Who the hell do they know
in South Yarra?

12:04.296 --> 12:05.866
Did you get
any conversation?

12:05.901 --> 12:08.266
No, there's no listening device
in the car.

12:08.301 --> 12:10.381
We haven't got a permit.
There's a tracker only.

12:10.416 --> 12:11.901
There's intercepts
on all the phones,

12:11.936 --> 12:13.398
but no-one's made a call yet.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.826
Go and front the Supreme Court

12:14.861 --> 12:17.295
and get a warrant
to OK an LD in that car.

12:43.541 --> 12:45.054
Mish!

12:46.221 --> 12:49.261
Mish, I'm home.

12:49.296 --> 12:51.855
Mishy?

12:53.981 --> 12:56.106
What's he doing?

12:56.141 --> 12:57.986
He's calling her.

12:58.021 --> 13:00.701
Hi, this is Michelle.
Can't answer the phone at the moment.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.626
If you're boring, hang up.

13:02.661 --> 13:04.226
If not, please leave
a name and number

13:04.261 --> 13:06.901
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I feel like it.

13:06.936 --> 13:09.021
Mishy, hi, it's me. Look, sorry.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.266
Um, I got held up, so...

13:11.301 --> 13:13.941
I know I said I was going
to be home at around 9:00

13:13.976 --> 13:15.826
but it's looking
more like 10:30, yeah?

13:15.861 --> 13:18.901
Don't feel like you've
got to wait up or anything,

13:18.936 --> 13:21.101
but if you do,
I'll make it worth your while.

13:21.136 --> 13:22.946
Promise.

13:22.981 --> 13:24.426
Alright, darlin'?

13:24.461 --> 13:26.706
I love you. OK, thanks. 'Bye.

13:26.741 --> 13:28.626
He's going back outside.
Oh, shit.

13:28.661 --> 13:30.936
Where's our guy?
I'm not in contact. Call backup.

13:58.661 --> 14:00.701
It's alright.
He's in the clear. Is it working?

14:00.736 --> 14:02.134
I'm just trying to get the channel.

14:05.701 --> 14:07.858
What was that?
It's working.

14:07.893 --> 14:10.015
He must have turned the radio on.

14:11.341 --> 14:13.301
She's bloody
cheating on me, buddy.

14:13.336 --> 14:15.621
I mean, she's got to be, right?

14:15.656 --> 14:17.066
Fuck.

14:17.101 --> 14:21.261
You can't trust 'em, you know, mate.
They're only good for one thing.

14:21.296 --> 14:23.546
What's the old joke?

14:23.581 --> 14:26.781
They're just a life support system
for a vagina, mate.

14:26.816 --> 14:28.261
That's all a woman is.

14:28.296 --> 14:30.217
Dump her.

14:32.741 --> 14:36.661
Look, if you can off a bloke
in front of his kids,

14:36.696 --> 14:38.786
you can dump a chick
who's cheating on you.

14:38.821 --> 14:40.821
This should not be difficult.
I know, mate, I know!

14:40.856 --> 14:43.654
No big deal, right? I know.

14:45.421 --> 14:47.518
But I don't know.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.616
There's something...

14:52.861 --> 14:54.941
Dad thought Mum was
cheating on him once.

14:54.976 --> 14:56.678
How'd he handle it?

14:56.713 --> 14:58.346
He bit her nipple off.

14:58.381 --> 15:01.066
I saw it too.
I'm not shittin' ya.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.621
Went for her with a knife
a couple of years later.

15:03.656 --> 15:06.141
I was a bit older then
so I ran across the street,

15:06.176 --> 15:07.586
tried to get some help.

15:07.621 --> 15:10.021
By the time I come back,
prick had stabbed her 30 times.

15:11.821 --> 15:14.066
Some women never learn, do they?

15:14.101 --> 15:17.138
No, no, she hadn't
done anything that time.

15:18.861 --> 15:20.621
She never liked him after that.

15:20.656 --> 15:23.101
How old were ya?
10, 11.

15:23.136 --> 15:25.490
Shit.

15:32.301 --> 15:34.053
Wake up. Wake up.

15:38.501 --> 15:43.370
Good morning, officers!

15:44.421 --> 15:46.981
Go on, get out.
It's breakfast time.

15:47.016 --> 15:49.506
Suppose I better get up too, yeah?

15:49.541 --> 15:51.941
Yeah, if you ever
want to get sucked off again, yes.

15:51.976 --> 15:53.386
All the halogens need changing

15:53.421 --> 15:55.666
and the spin cycle
on the washing machine's fucked.

15:55.701 --> 16:00.058
Property developers should not
have to put up with this.

16:13.141 --> 16:15.052
What'd you get up to last night?

16:16.941 --> 16:18.746
Had some tea.

16:18.781 --> 16:20.226
Watched some telly.

16:20.261 --> 16:22.666
And then I had a long shower.

16:22.701 --> 16:25.461
That must have been when you called.

16:25.496 --> 16:27.417
I did get your message.

16:33.381 --> 16:34.826
Yeah, right.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.136
Sorry I fell asleep.

16:39.301 --> 16:41.019
Sorry I was late.

17:14.781 --> 17:19.421
Hey, let's do something tonight.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.501
Yeah, sure.

17:48.221 --> 17:50.561
Was it your whole class?
Yep.

17:50.596 --> 17:52.866
How many did you get wrong?

17:52.901 --> 17:55.621
One. It was L-A-K-E. I said 'like'.

17:55.656 --> 17:57.386
Ahh.

17:57.421 --> 18:00.901
This happens every afternoon, yeah?
Yeah.

18:00.936 --> 18:03.226
When do you want to do it?

18:03.261 --> 18:05.341
I'll give you a call,
I guess. I don't know.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.786
Well, don't leave it too long, mate.

18:06.821 --> 18:09.061
I've got the arse falling out
of my trousers this week.

18:09.096 --> 18:11.498
Oh, he tackles him! BALL!

18:11.533 --> 18:13.901
Quick kick. Kick us the ball!

18:13.936 --> 18:16.256
Oh, good kick. Come on.

18:17.861 --> 18:20.381
Well, sometimes they stop
but never in the same place.

18:20.416 --> 18:22.021
Otherwise they just
go round and round.

18:22.056 --> 18:24.146
But what is the job?

18:24.181 --> 18:25.941
We don't know.
They just talk about 'it'.

18:25.976 --> 18:27.466
You know, when they're gonna do 'it'.

18:27.501 --> 18:30.461
How's the phone traffic been?
Anyone's name been mentioned?

18:30.496 --> 18:32.146
No-one who lives in here.

18:32.181 --> 18:35.826
You know, 'it' could be
a thing, not a person.

18:35.861 --> 18:38.461
These guys have got a long history
of armed robbery.

18:38.496 --> 18:40.292
Good point.

18:56.821 --> 18:58.386
Could be the TAB at the Bush Inn.

18:58.421 --> 19:00.810
Or one of the banks.
They're on the move again.

19:01.861 --> 19:03.626
Is this it?

19:03.661 --> 19:06.698
No. They're still unarmed.

19:12.021 --> 19:13.946
What time is it?

19:13.981 --> 19:15.972
Just after half past.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.586
What's in Howitt Street?
Maybe that's a base.

19:23.621 --> 19:27.057
Now, remember he can run up to
a kilometre from the getaway car.

20:03.021 --> 20:05.306
If you do it when the kid's with him,

20:05.341 --> 20:07.336
it means he's slower
getting out of the car

20:07.371 --> 20:09.332
and he's not really
looking around much.

20:13.461 --> 20:15.133
I reckon that's your best option.

20:17.181 --> 20:18.660
Yeah.

20:27.741 --> 20:30.021
Was that some kind of
dress rehearsal, you reckon?

20:30.056 --> 20:32.732
It's gotta be this TAB here.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.409
We are very close.

20:54.781 --> 20:56.226
Hello!

20:56.261 --> 20:58.341
Where you off to?

20:58.376 --> 21:01.226
Out.
Where?

21:01.261 --> 21:03.541
To get something. For us.

21:03.576 --> 21:05.106
For tonight.

21:05.141 --> 21:07.521
It WAS going to be a surprise.

21:07.556 --> 21:09.901
Well, come on. I'll come too.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.098
Uh-uh.

21:14.781 --> 21:17.981
Ah, babe! It's for you, really.

21:18.016 --> 21:19.981
It's my treat. Come on.

21:20.016 --> 21:21.706
You stay here.

21:21.741 --> 21:24.209
I'll be back in two or three hours.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.861
Department?
Yeah, Bill Inquiries.

21:46.896 --> 21:49.501
Did you say, "Billing Inquiries"?

21:49.536 --> 21:51.014
Yes.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.546
Hello, Billing Inquiries.

21:53.581 --> 21:55.546
Are you a person or a computer?
A person, sir.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.586
Good. I need an itemised copy
of my last bill, please.

21:58.621 --> 22:01.781
They're not going to give it to him.
They'll only give it to her.

22:01.816 --> 22:03.781
Sorry, sir - we can only
pass that information on

22:03.816 --> 22:05.226
to the authorised account holder.

22:05.261 --> 22:07.266
She's just asked me
to do it, that's all.

22:07.301 --> 22:09.541
Is the account holder there?
Yeah, she's right here.

22:09.576 --> 22:11.781
You can talk to her,
but she's just asked me to do it.

22:11.816 --> 22:13.746
I need to speak to her.
Hang on a second.

22:13.781 --> 22:17.101
Yep, yep, I'll get her for you.
Hold on, one tick, one tick.

22:17.136 --> 22:21.106
Mishy! Mishy, they want you.

22:21.141 --> 22:24.506
"Just tell 'em to do it, babe!"

22:24.541 --> 22:28.101
No, they won't give it to me.
They need to speak to you.

22:28.136 --> 22:30.586
Garry?
"Just tell them that I want it!"

22:30.621 --> 22:34.941
They won't give it to me, ya bitch!
That's why they gotta talk to you!

22:34.976 --> 22:37.981
"Oh, for fuck's sake.
Do I have to do everything?

22:38.016 --> 22:40.466
"Jeez!"

22:40.501 --> 22:43.254
Who's that?
Running Man.

22:44.861 --> 22:48.421
"I just need an itemised copy
of my last bill."

22:48.456 --> 22:49.866
He's very good.

22:49.901 --> 22:52.661
"It's Michelle Mercieca."
Date of birth?

22:52.696 --> 22:54.666
"August 14, 1970."

22:54.701 --> 22:56.346
So it was your last bill?
"Mm-hm."

22:56.381 --> 22:58.341
OK, Michelle, we'll fax that
to you right away.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.438
"Great. Thank you!"

23:00.473 --> 23:02.466
They're doing it now.

23:02.501 --> 23:04.701
Where's our copy?
Have we got a copy of this?

23:04.736 --> 23:06.259
Oh, yeah, should do.

23:24.021 --> 23:25.586
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

23:25.621 --> 23:27.781
Yeah, Benj, can you
talk for a second?

23:27.816 --> 23:29.226
Yeah, mate, fire away.

23:29.261 --> 23:32.412
Mate, I think
Mishy's screwing around on me.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.861
Well, there's this number
on her phone bill, right,

23:35.896 --> 23:37.306
that I haven't seen before

23:37.341 --> 23:39.861
and she's called the fuckin' thing
about a million times.

23:39.896 --> 23:40.826
Fuck, mate.

23:40.861 --> 23:43.381
And I was thinking I was just
going to call it straight up

23:43.416 --> 23:45.901
but then I thought no,
I should just, like, ask around,

23:45.936 --> 23:47.586
see if anyone knows
who I'm messing with.

23:47.621 --> 23:50.981
Know what I mean? She mention
anything to you, Bobbie, Carl, anyone?

23:51.016 --> 23:54.318
No mate, nothin'.
Not that I know of.

23:54.353 --> 23:57.621
I guess I just gotta
call it up then, eh?

23:57.656 --> 23:59.106
Fuck it, I would!

23:59.141 --> 24:01.541
I'm gonna rip his dick off, Benj.
That's what I'm gonna do.

24:01.576 --> 24:03.066
One of 'em's gotta cop it, right?

24:03.101 --> 24:05.541
You know, I'm just a weak
piece of shit otherwise, right?

24:05.576 --> 24:08.301
Yeah, mate. Go for it.
What can I say?

24:08.336 --> 24:09.906
Thanks, Benj.

24:09.941 --> 24:11.661
Alright, mate. No worries.
Take it easy.

24:11.696 --> 24:13.219
That's it, guys.

24:15.821 --> 24:19.018
Thanks, fellas. See ya tomorrow.
Yeah, look forward to it.

24:23.101 --> 24:25.410
Who was that?
No-one.

24:26.501 --> 24:28.779
Fuckin' prepaid junk.

24:28.814 --> 24:31.057
Hey, baby, come here.

24:43.421 --> 24:44.906
Oh, shit.
What?

24:44.941 --> 24:46.946
He's dialled the wrong number.

24:46.981 --> 24:52.221
He's supposed to dial 0416
and he's dialled 0413.

24:52.256 --> 24:54.421
So who's he gonna get?
Well, dunno.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.146
Hello?

24:58.181 --> 25:01.021
Hello, sir, this is Edward Kelly
from the Australian Taxation Office.

25:01.056 --> 25:03.178
Er, does this phone belong to you?
Yes.

25:03.213 --> 25:05.301
Good. Can you tell us
your name, please?

25:05.336 --> 25:07.398
Don't tell him your name.

25:07.433 --> 25:09.426
John Wang.
Thank you, John.

25:09.461 --> 25:12.466
We're preparing an audit
into your affairs

25:12.501 --> 25:14.901
and I have to tell you that
this call may be recorded

25:14.936 --> 25:16.346
for training purposes only.

25:16.381 --> 25:19.261
Can we start by confirming
your address, please, John?

25:19.296 --> 25:23.621
Uh, 46 Hill Street, Box Hill.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.386
Thank you, sir.

25:25.421 --> 25:29.341
And can you also tell me
why are you fucking my girlfriend?

25:29.376 --> 25:31.478
What?
You heard me, you little prick.

25:31.513 --> 25:34.007
Where'd ya fuckin' meet her?
Piss off.

25:34.042 --> 25:36.501
What?
I said, piss off, you nutcase.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.946
Piss off?

25:37.981 --> 25:39.541
Yeah, I haven't touched
your bloody girlfriend.

25:39.576 --> 25:43.250
Don't you lie to me!
Yeah, whatever. Jerk.

25:46.861 --> 25:48.666
Hey, you want to be tough, arsehole?

25:48.701 --> 25:51.181
You want to be fuckin' tough
now, don't ya, eh?

25:51.216 --> 25:53.118
Yeah, I'll show you
fuckin' tough, pal.

25:53.153 --> 25:55.021
I'll show you tough,
you little prick.

25:55.056 --> 25:57.171
Yeah, we'll see who's tough now.

25:59.901 --> 26:01.812
Bloody hell.

26:08.181 --> 26:09.661
If we pull him over now,

26:09.696 --> 26:11.106
he's gonna know
we've been listening.

26:11.141 --> 26:14.101
Exactly. So we've gotta get this
John Wang guy right out of the way.

26:14.136 --> 26:16.535
Without letting him know why?
He can't know a thing.

26:43.461 --> 26:44.610
I'm comin' in!

26:46.061 --> 26:48.301
I thought I would've
got a reminder or something.

26:48.336 --> 26:50.138
I mean, it's only a speeding fine.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.906
You didn't have to
drag me down here.

26:51.941 --> 26:55.092
I could have paid it over the phone
if you'd sent me a reminder notice.

26:57.301 --> 26:59.066
OK.

26:59.101 --> 27:01.012
OK, fair enough.

27:21.421 --> 27:22.854
Jesus.

27:37.421 --> 27:38.959
Uh-oh.

27:38.994 --> 27:40.497
Garry.

27:48.861 --> 27:51.106
Mate, we're hot.

27:51.141 --> 27:53.141
I think I've found something,
like a bug or something.

27:53.176 --> 27:55.198
You know what they look like?

27:55.233 --> 27:56.967
Shit. Where?
In the HiAce.

27:57.002 --> 27:58.666
Deadset?
I'm not sure.

27:58.701 --> 28:00.266
I mean, do you know
what they're like?

28:00.301 --> 28:03.501
Bring it over and let's have a look.
We gotta pull out if it is.

28:03.536 --> 28:05.386
Yeah, OK.

28:05.421 --> 28:06.866
What's happened?

28:06.901 --> 28:09.081
They found the LD in the car.

28:09.116 --> 28:11.286
And they've aborted the job?

28:11.321 --> 28:13.456
Well, they're not total idiots.

28:15.021 --> 28:16.786
Oh, well.

28:16.821 --> 28:19.051
Looks like there's
nothing we can do now.

28:22.581 --> 28:25.101
My ride's here
so I suppose I'll see you Monday.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.146
Hey, Susie.

28:26.181 --> 28:28.421
Hey. Not a good day, huh?

28:28.456 --> 28:30.898
Very depressing.

28:30.933 --> 28:33.306
Is that him?
Hmm?

28:33.341 --> 28:38.661
The shooter from the Auskick thing?
Yeah, that's what we reckon.

28:38.696 --> 28:41.226
What a psychopath.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.226
He's a failed psychopath, actually.

28:43.261 --> 28:45.881
I spoke to one of the shrinks
who saw him in jail

28:45.916 --> 28:48.128
and apparently
he was born with no feelings -

28:48.163 --> 28:50.341
so, in other words,
he's a bona-fide psychopath

28:50.376 --> 28:52.506
but then something happened

28:52.541 --> 28:55.426
which meant that in some situations

28:55.461 --> 28:57.941
he's just capable
of actually feeling something.

28:57.976 --> 29:00.466
Just not when there's
a car-Ioad of kiddies

29:00.501 --> 29:02.541
in between him
and the person he wants to shoot.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.293
Yeah, no, that doesn't count.

29:05.341 --> 29:07.321
You having a fucking affair, bitch?
No!

29:07.356 --> 29:09.301
Hey? Are you having
a fucking affair?

29:09.336 --> 29:10.746
No! Get off me!

29:10.781 --> 29:13.681
Are you or not?
I am not having an affair!

29:13.716 --> 29:16.248
So who's the Box Hill dude then?
I don't know!

29:16.283 --> 29:18.746
You've called that number
at least eight times!

29:18.781 --> 29:21.301
I've seen it on your account.
Yeah, I call lots of people.

29:21.336 --> 29:23.821
If they don't answer, I call back
and call back and call back!

29:23.856 --> 29:26.021
Could be a hairdresser,
a florist, a pizza-delivery guy.

29:26.056 --> 29:28.038
Who knows?
Yeah? And what about this afternoon?

29:28.073 --> 29:30.021
You said you were going out
to get me something.

29:30.056 --> 29:31.466
Yeah.
Well?

29:31.501 --> 29:32.466
We can't afford it.

29:32.501 --> 29:35.761
Don't you fuckin' lie to me!
Please, please! Babe, please!

29:35.796 --> 29:39.021
Cards on the table here, right?
Cards on the fucking table.

29:39.056 --> 29:40.626
Are you fucking with me or what?

29:40.661 --> 29:46.099
Benji... Benji took me out
to see Roberta's plastic surgeon.

29:48.381 --> 29:51.261
After you jerked off all through
that Angelina Jolie movie,

29:51.296 --> 29:52.706
I just thought, you know,

29:52.741 --> 29:55.746
if I want you to change
to be a bit nicer to me, then...

29:55.781 --> 30:00.181
<i>... then maybe I should change a bit
to be a bit nicer to you too.</i>

30:00.216 --> 30:02.426
Be more what you want.

30:02.461 --> 30:04.895
So I looked into
getting some work done.

30:05.941 --> 30:08.141
Just everything a bit more sexy.

30:08.176 --> 30:10.211
For you.

30:11.941 --> 30:16.776
Tits like Angelina's?
Yeah. And lips.

30:18.821 --> 30:20.254
Wow.

30:25.501 --> 30:27.259
For me?

30:27.294 --> 30:29.018
Yeah.

30:32.821 --> 30:35.540
This better be true.
I swear.

30:36.621 --> 30:39.741
So when's it happening?
Well, we can't afford it.

30:39.776 --> 30:42.861
No, no, no, no. Don't say can't, OK?
Don't say can't.

30:42.896 --> 30:45.181
It'd cost us 70 grand.
That's doable.

30:45.216 --> 30:46.866
Yeah?

30:46.901 --> 30:48.781
If I get the money, will you do it?

30:48.816 --> 30:51.170
Yeah.

30:56.701 --> 30:58.134
Come here.

30:59.821 --> 31:03.211
I fuckin' love you.
I love you too, baby.

31:12.461 --> 31:14.019
Show me.
Rightio.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.494
What do you think?

31:38.101 --> 31:40.586
Yeah, it's a bug. So what?

31:40.621 --> 31:43.506
So what?! We're fucked.
They're onto us.

31:43.541 --> 31:47.101
Mate, if they were onto us,
we'd be fighting them off right now.

31:47.136 --> 31:49.456
I reckon we go ahead.
Sooner the better, I reckon.

31:50.541 --> 31:53.506
Yeah, stupid dumb cops.
So what if they're listening?

31:53.541 --> 31:57.420
As long as we don't say nothin',
they've got nothin'. Right?

31:58.701 --> 32:00.338
Do it.

32:00.373 --> 32:01.976
Come on.

32:11.261 --> 32:13.411
See ya, mate.
See ya, boys.

32:20.501 --> 32:22.621
Hey, you need
a shower afterwards?

32:22.656 --> 32:24.306
Yeah. Yeah.

32:24.341 --> 32:27.461
Here we go. Get a call out.
I need everybody back here right now.

32:27.496 --> 32:30.339
Can we go around to your place?
Sure.

32:35.021 --> 32:38.381
They're mad. They know they're hot.
Hey, don't knock it.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.746
Been waiting years
for a mistake like this.

32:40.781 --> 32:43.341
You gonna help Dad
pick up his bread rolls again?

32:43.376 --> 32:46.026
It's a big night. Saturday night.

32:46.061 --> 32:48.461
I reckon we might
have to get two bags.

32:48.496 --> 32:50.426
I'll carry one.
Yeah?

32:50.461 --> 32:53.100
Let's just wait and see
how heavy they are, eh?

32:55.421 --> 32:57.746
Jones, Owen, Kaldas, Brownlow.

32:57.781 --> 33:01.101
Two cars,
but stay outside the target area.

33:01.136 --> 33:02.866
If they get a whiff, they'll abort.

33:02.901 --> 33:07.061
We've got to hang back until we can
establish intent to commit a crime.

33:07.096 --> 33:08.858
By then we will know the target.

33:10.701 --> 33:13.215
Alright. Onto it.
And wear vests.

33:14.781 --> 33:17.421
Yeah, I think he likes me.
Oh, really?

33:17.456 --> 33:18.900
Oooh. Hello.

33:20.461 --> 33:22.946
Keep walking, darling.
She's cute.

33:22.981 --> 33:25.586
Wonder what she'd taste like.
Creeps.

33:25.621 --> 33:28.861
Are you right, are ya?
It's not your sister, is it?

33:28.896 --> 33:30.772
You wish.

33:33.941 --> 33:37.506
What time is it?
10 past.

33:37.541 --> 33:40.301
OK. Toorak Road's clear.
Our guys are back here.

33:40.336 --> 33:41.746
SOGs are waiting on this side.

33:41.781 --> 33:43.346
You reckon they're
gonna hit the bank?

33:43.381 --> 33:46.221
Well, it's Saturday. The banks'll
be closed. It's gotta be that TAB.

33:46.256 --> 33:48.177
A ram-raid?
They could hit a bank that's closed.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.941
Jesus! Watch it!
I can't help dickheads.

33:56.976 --> 33:59.421
Sorry, mate. You right?
Yeah, yeah.

33:59.456 --> 34:01.466
What's happened?

34:01.501 --> 34:04.021
Come on, guys.
What's going on? Where are they?

34:04.056 --> 34:06.541
Uh, we've lost the tracker.
Shit! It's frozen.

34:06.576 --> 34:07.506
Unfreeze it!

34:07.541 --> 34:10.386
We can only do that by rebooting.
What's that mean?

34:10.420 --> 34:13.341
It means powering down, letting it
clear and powering it back up again.

34:13.376 --> 34:15.460
The listening device
is on the same software.

34:15.496 --> 34:17.061
When we put it in,
they were linked.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.701
How long will it take to reboot?

34:18.735 --> 34:20.306
About five minutes.
What?!

34:20.341 --> 34:23.061
If we reboot, we can get them
both back in about five minutes,

34:23.096 --> 34:24.661
but in the meantime
they could do anything

34:24.696 --> 34:26.106
and we won't have any evidence.

34:26.141 --> 34:29.661
If we let it go, we can record what
happens, but we couldn't stop them

34:29.696 --> 34:31.299
because we don't know
exactly where they are.

34:35.460 --> 34:37.701
If they're robbing a bank
or the TAB,

34:37.735 --> 34:39.181
we might have time to reboot.

34:39.216 --> 34:40.626
But five minutes?

34:40.661 --> 34:43.121
An armed robbery could easily
take longer than five minutes.

34:43.156 --> 34:45.428
If it does we can reboot,
establish intent, stop a crime.

34:45.463 --> 34:47.701
Yes, but if they're fast
we will lose the opportunity

34:47.735 --> 34:49.746
of getting anything
on which to convict.

34:49.781 --> 34:51.981
Our first job's gotta be
stopping them, doesn't it?

34:52.016 --> 34:53.355
Reboot.

34:53.389 --> 34:54.695
OK.

34:58.501 --> 35:02.699
No. It's my call.
I'll live with it. Leave it.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.746
All units, all units.

35:08.781 --> 35:10.741
We've lost the tracker
but we still have sound.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.066
Target last seen two minutes ago

35:13.101 --> 35:16.298
on the corner of Cromwell Road
and Motherwell Street.

35:20.301 --> 35:22.451
Right on time.

35:25.341 --> 35:26.330
There he is.

35:27.781 --> 35:29.466
Who's 'he'?
Who's 'he'?

35:29.501 --> 35:31.298
Is this a robbery or a hit?
Shit.

36:02.821 --> 36:06.052
Go! Get in there! Get in there!
Find that target now!

36:19.901 --> 36:21.346
Who's he ringing?

36:21.381 --> 36:24.612
Er... it's Carl.

36:28.221 --> 36:30.066
Hello?
Yeah, hi. It's me.

36:30.101 --> 36:32.301
You know that horse
we were talking about?

36:32.336 --> 36:35.259
Yeah?
It's just been scratched.

36:37.381 --> 36:39.101
Let's get these bastards.

36:46.261 --> 36:48.386
Police!
Don't move! Don't move!

36:48.421 --> 36:51.697
Stay in the car!
Police! Don't move!

37:34.661 --> 37:36.106
Arggh!

37:36.141 --> 37:39.341
Don't move! Don't move.
Get off me, pig!

37:39.376 --> 37:41.426
Get down! Get down!

37:41.461 --> 37:43.601
My name is
Detective Sergeant Steve Owen.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.741
You are under arrest
for the murder of...

37:45.776 --> 37:47.186
Bill!

37:47.221 --> 37:49.626
Who'd he shoot, mate?
Don't know.

37:49.661 --> 37:52.181
Well, whoever you just shot, mate.
Yeah, you roll over.

37:52.216 --> 37:54.376
Go on! Now!

37:55.861 --> 37:57.541
Hey!

37:57.576 --> 37:59.221
Oi!

38:20.901 --> 38:25.338
Hey, you are so brave.
Your dad would be really proud of you.

38:29.621 --> 38:33.296
The man who hurt your dad,
was he wearing a mask?

38:34.461 --> 38:37.134
So you didn't see
what he looked like?

38:38.181 --> 38:39.694
Did he say anything to you?

38:41.941 --> 38:43.781
And what did you do
after he ran away?

38:43.816 --> 38:46.141
I ran across the road to get Mum.

38:46.176 --> 38:48.586
OK. Good boy.

38:48.621 --> 38:50.541
Anything else you wanna tell me?

38:50.576 --> 38:53.578
I looked both ways first.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.821
So?
Tell me they didn't make bail.

39:04.856 --> 39:06.346
No, we had too much on them.

39:06.381 --> 39:08.301
We had the blood
on his shoe, the gun.

39:08.336 --> 39:10.858
They're both remanded in custody.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.877
Well done.
About bloody time.

39:12.912 --> 39:14.826
Did they say anything about Carl?

39:14.861 --> 39:16.586
They're not saying anything much
at the moment,

39:16.621 --> 39:19.021
but they're both in 23-hour lockdown,
so let's see what happens.

39:19.056 --> 39:22.934
Well done.

40:16.141 --> 40:17.733
Hey.

40:54.301 --> 40:57.461
Garry. Garry.
Can you tell us what's going on?

40:57.496 --> 41:00.338
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just wish to confirm

41:00.373 --> 41:03.146
that we have arrested
and charged two men

41:03.181 --> 41:06.821
in relation to the murder
of Michael Marshall in South Yarra.

41:06.856 --> 41:09.666
While this was
truly a horrific crime,

41:09.701 --> 41:13.821
the speed of our response
should reassure the Victorian public

41:13.856 --> 41:17.941
that Taskforce Purana is now
a very real and potent weapon

41:17.976 --> 41:20.838
against organised crime
in this State.

41:20.873 --> 41:23.701
And to those involved
in organised crime,

41:23.736 --> 41:25.941
this should serve as a warning.

41:25.976 --> 41:28.296
We are coming to get you.
