WEBVTT

00:01.738 --> 00:03.117
Hold the elevator!

00:06.087 --> 00:07.414
Oh.

00:07.903 --> 00:09.285
Oh, my God, Ben!

00:09.286 --> 00:10.835
It is so good to see you.

00:11.227 --> 00:13.168
And how good do you smell?

00:13.169 --> 00:14.983
What is that? Eau de delicious?

00:15.884 --> 00:17.235
You two know each other, right?

00:17.236 --> 00:18.813
We've met.

00:18.814 --> 00:20.227
Kayla.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.866
Ben.

00:21.867 --> 00:23.313
So how come you and little Emma

00:23.314 --> 00:24.774
never come to our play group?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.693
- "Play" what?
- Play nothing. It's nothing.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.996
Sondra, please stop talking.

00:27.997 --> 00:30.271
It's not nothing. It's the best thing ever!

00:31.153 --> 00:32.965
We meet twice a week at Kayla's.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.713
Oh! You meet twice a
week at Kayla's, do you?

00:35.714 --> 00:37.510
Yeah, every parent in the
neighborhood brings their kids,

00:37.811 --> 00:39.357
and they're all becoming such good friends.

00:39.358 --> 00:40.894
It's so cute!

00:40.895 --> 00:42.099
<i>- Really?</i>

00:42.100 --> 00:43.193
All the kids in the neighborhood?

00:43.194 --> 00:44.746
Oh, look! Here's your floor.

00:44.747 --> 00:46.275
Oh, I think I'll just keep going up.

00:46.823 --> 00:48.836
So maybe we'll see you
at the next play group?

00:49.166 --> 00:51.020
<i>- It's this afternoon. Here's a flyer.</i>

00:52.677 --> 00:54.188
It would be so good for Emma.

00:54.189 --> 00:56.077
And you and I should totally
get together sometime.

00:56.078 --> 00:57.782
I keep meaning to tell you
there's this one place...

00:57.783 --> 00:58.785
and we can go
downstairs...

01:00.685 --> 01:02.876
so Kayla, how you been?

01:02.877 --> 01:04.084
Good? Good.

01:04.084 --> 01:05.643
I was just thinking maybe it's time

01:05.644 --> 01:07.723
we put our little feud behind us.

01:07.724 --> 01:09.564
It was just so darn silly, wasn't it?

01:10.017 --> 01:11.949
Ben, you and your degenerate roommates

01:11.950 --> 01:13.842
broke into my kid's room
while he was sleeping

01:13.843 --> 01:15.255
and stole his favorite toy.

01:15.691 --> 01:19.027
Which in hindsight was not
one of my proudest moments.

01:19.790 --> 01:22.088
However, what do you say we
don't take it out on Emma?

01:22.089 --> 01:23.389
She is just a baby.

01:23.693 --> 01:25.376
You're right. I guess the poor thing has

01:25.377 --> 01:27.340
enough strikes against her
with you as a role model.

01:27.874 --> 01:29.133
So you'll
let us into...

01:29.479 --> 01:31.996
Wait. Are you saying I'm a bad dad?

01:31.997 --> 01:33.441
Yeah, pretty much.

01:36.177 --> 01:39.132
<i>* It's amazing how the unexpected *</i>

01:39.133 --> 01:42.164
<i>* Can take your life
and change direction. *</i>

01:47.809 --> 01:49.129
Yes! Three points!

01:49.130 --> 01:50.213
Damn it.

01:50.214 --> 01:52.033
I think Vanessa and I just broke up again.

01:53.390 --> 01:54.742
All caps.

01:57.406 --> 01:58.844
Didn't you just get back together?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.570
Dude, how do you even keep track?

02:00.571 --> 02:03.301
Oh, well, it is all right
here in this little...

02:03.696 --> 02:05.004
Oh my God.

02:05.005 --> 02:06.653
I just deleted our history.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.716
Whatever, she'll break up with
me again tomorrow. It's fine.

02:11.405 --> 02:12.766
Knock knock!

02:12.767 --> 02:14.044
Oh, hey, babe.

02:14.045 --> 02:15.638
Oh, my God, Danny. You're not ready.

02:15.639 --> 02:16.837
Why aren't you ready?

02:16.838 --> 02:18.896
You said you would be
ready and you are not ready.

02:20.392 --> 02:21.542
Ready for what?

02:21.543 --> 02:23.290
For what? Are you kidding me?

02:23.291 --> 02:25.059
Okay, please say you're kidding
me. How could you forget?

02:25.563 --> 02:27.484
I didn't forget.

02:27.485 --> 02:28.972
Oh, really? What are we doing?

02:28.973 --> 02:30.525
Ha! See you forgot too.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.473
We are meeting my sister for lunch.

02:34.474 --> 02:36.485
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry. I just need two seconds.</i>

02:36.486 --> 02:38.026
That's outta bounds, ref! Come on!

02:38.027 --> 02:39.456
Okay. You know what, Danny?

02:39.457 --> 02:40.489
If you don't wanna go, then don't go.

02:40.490 --> 02:41.568
That'd be great.

02:48.582 --> 02:49.777
What just happened?

02:50.102 --> 02:52.443
<i>I think she just cleared your history.</i>

02:54.131 --> 02:56.536
Dude, go after her! Even I know that.

02:56.537 --> 02:57.652
<i>- Right.</i>

02:57.653 --> 02:59.990
Oh, yes! Overtime!

02:59.991 --> 03:00.861
Wow.

03:00.862 --> 03:03.341
Oh, yeah yeah! Amy! Wait!

03:03.933 --> 03:05.707
Okay, Emma.

03:06.034 --> 03:08.326
Time to go to the park and watch grandma

03:08.327 --> 03:10.775
pretend to be a Swedish nanny
who doesn't speak English.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.397
Oh, men are so simple.

03:18.739 --> 03:20.269
Okay. First of all,

03:20.270 --> 03:22.793
that Amy has a very colorful vocabulary.

03:23.186 --> 03:24.287
And second,

03:24.288 --> 03:26.826
did you know that Kayla,
the mini meanie in 5-D,

03:26.827 --> 03:28.504
is secretly hosting a play group?

03:28.864 --> 03:29.735
Oh, my God!

03:29.736 --> 03:31.446
Have you called homeland security?!

03:32.585 --> 03:33.643
Mom!

03:33.644 --> 03:34.668
All the kids in the neighborhood

03:34.669 --> 03:36.248
have been invited except for Emma.

03:36.249 --> 03:37.305
All the kids?

03:37.306 --> 03:38.606
Every one of them.

03:38.607 --> 03:41.121
So she's only excluding Emma?

03:41.122 --> 03:42.353
Just our little girl.

03:42.354 --> 03:44.218
Okay, that is totally unfair!

03:44.219 --> 03:45.614
Now you're mad, aren't ya?

03:46.048 --> 03:47.105
<i>Yeah!</i>

03:47.609 --> 03:49.057
Oh, my God, you guys.

03:49.058 --> 03:51.627
This is totally like boy
scouts all over again.

03:52.844 --> 03:55.374
Look, I had to use my mom's scarf

03:55.375 --> 03:56.809
and make my own badges.

03:58.594 --> 03:59.780
Okay, well, obviously...

04:00.786 --> 04:02.401
We have to do something.

04:02.402 --> 04:05.025
I was thinking maybe we
could just sneak Emma in

04:05.026 --> 04:07.728
and tell Kayla that you're
new in the neighborhood.

04:07.729 --> 04:09.112
<i>- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

04:09.113 --> 04:10.575
Yeah yeah, that's good, that's good.

04:11.813 --> 04:13.419
What do I do?

04:13.774 --> 04:15.608
Uh, you're not part of the plan.

04:15.609 --> 04:17.161
I'm excluded again?

04:17.161 --> 04:19.813
Where does it end?! This...

04:20.379 --> 04:21.272
Okay, Ben,

04:21.273 --> 04:23.378
but won't Kayla recognize Emma?

04:23.379 --> 04:25.440
We'll just slap a bow on her

04:25.441 --> 04:27.257
and call her Esmerelda.

04:27.716 --> 04:30.225
They
all more or less look alike.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.408
What book you read that in?

04:33.409 --> 04:34.778
"What to expect when you're an idiot."

04:39.977 --> 04:42.524
But she said, "if you don't
wanna go, then don't go."

04:42.979 --> 04:44.423
Which actually means

04:44.732 --> 04:46.635
"get your lazy ass off the couch and go."

04:47.854 --> 04:49.255
Then why didn't she just say that?

04:49.256 --> 04:50.863
Wouldn't it be easier to
just say what you mean?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.860
Oh, my God, no.

04:53.953 --> 04:55.619
Okay, here's the problem:

04:55.620 --> 04:58.156
If we ask you outright,
you think we're nagging.

04:58.157 --> 04:59.757
But if we don't say anything at all,

04:59.758 --> 05:01.409
then nothing would ever get done.

05:01.410 --> 05:03.994
So we have created a language all our own.

05:03.995 --> 05:05.749
It's called "girl."

05:06.696 --> 05:08.490
And I suggest you learn how to speak it.

05:09.257 --> 05:10.549
Is it like French?

05:10.550 --> 05:12.572
<i>Because I le failed that
three times in high school.</i>

05:14.212 --> 05:16.085
Well, at least there's one woman

05:16.086 --> 05:18.450
who can motivate you to put
on pants and leave the house.

05:18.770 --> 05:20.581
Amy, hi!

05:20.582 --> 05:22.552
Riley was just teaching me how
to make sense of what you say.

05:24.903 --> 05:26.133
No, I wasn't.

05:27.073 --> 05:29.726
Are you saying you need Riley
to explain what I say to you?

05:31.404 --> 05:32.824
No.

05:34.605 --> 05:36.423
You're not mad, are
you? Please don't be mad.

05:36.424 --> 05:38.413
No, of course not. Why would I be mad?

05:38.414 --> 05:39.724
Oh, good.

05:39.725 --> 05:41.301
She's mad.

05:42.238 --> 05:44.026
Okay, um, I'm gonna go.

05:44.027 --> 05:45.163
So he's all yours.

05:46.174 --> 05:47.995
Amy, please don't be upset.

05:47.996 --> 05:49.312
I'm trying, I really am.

05:50.151 --> 05:51.429
I know you are.

05:51.430 --> 05:54.574
So how about we go out
for a romantic night on the town?

05:54.575 --> 05:55.586
Whatever you wanna do.

05:56.026 --> 05:57.855
Maybe we could go salsa dancing.

05:57.856 --> 05:59.059
That'd be so fun.

05:59.386 --> 06:01.333
Ohh. Dancing.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.203
How about I just
make you the salsa instead?

06:05.610 --> 06:07.011
Right. Right. Yeah.

06:07.012 --> 06:09.763
Whatever you wanna do. Mm-hmm.

06:09.764 --> 06:12.503
I'm sensing that means
whatever you wanna do.

06:13.912 --> 06:15.000
Turns out that Riley

06:15.001 --> 06:16.914
really knows what she's talking about.

06:20.067 --> 06:21.898
- Huh, Esmerelda?
- Yeah.

06:21.899 --> 06:23.264
That is such an...

06:23.265 --> 06:24.453
Interesting name.

06:24.816 --> 06:26.847
I'm sorry, I don't think
we've officially met.

06:26.848 --> 06:27.760
I'm Kayla.

06:27.761 --> 06:29.640
Oh, Kayla. I'm Bonnie Wheel...

06:29.641 --> 06:31.430
Chohovitzstein.

06:32.915 --> 06:35.571
Esmerelda and I, we just
moved in across the way.

06:35.931 --> 06:37.757
You know, I have to say,

06:37.758 --> 06:40.307
Esmerelda looks a little familiar to me.

06:40.308 --> 06:41.672
Oh. Oh, really?

06:41.673 --> 06:44.700
Because, um, you don't
look familiar to her at all.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.962
Although, you guys should
really get to know each other.

06:47.963 --> 06:49.693
You could share clothes.

06:50.675 --> 06:51.643
Funny.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.037
Uh, so, Bonnie, what do you do?

06:54.369 --> 06:56.284
Uh, me?
Umm...

06:56.285 --> 06:59.412
I'm... a rockette.

07:00.511 --> 07:01.424
Oh, my God!

07:01.425 --> 07:02.834
You're a rockette?! So was I.

07:03.325 --> 07:04.548
Really?

07:04.998 --> 07:06.694
Uh-huh. You must know
Jennifer and Monica.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.594
Oh, my God. Totally do.

07:09.242 --> 07:11.313
But I wouldn't
tell them that you saw me.

07:11.655 --> 07:13.109
They're getting fired.

07:18.507 --> 07:20.342
Mom, I got your text. What's wrong?

07:20.343 --> 07:21.732
I think our cover's blown.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.568
One of those play group biddies made me.

07:24.135 --> 07:25.360
Why didn't you just leave?

07:25.361 --> 07:26.411
Well, I tried.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.319
But she's got childproof locks everywhere.

07:28.806 --> 07:30.851
I was stuck in the bathroom for 20 minutes.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.678
But aren't these soaps adorable?

07:34.679 --> 07:35.693
Look at 'em.

07:35.694 --> 07:37.039
They're like tiny shells.

07:37.971 --> 07:39.381
Mom, relax.

07:39.382 --> 07:41.434
There is no way that
Kayla is ever gonna know

07:41.435 --> 07:42.509
that Emma's my kid.

07:43.724 --> 07:44.614
Ben.

07:45.558 --> 07:46.955
Well, I guess that's one way.

07:49.266 --> 07:51.240
Oh, these aren't your soaps.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.301
They're gum.

07:57.949 --> 07:59.582
There you go, sweetie.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.066
So we'll see the two of you at two.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.494
Bring your babies and your sense of wonder.

08:03.495 --> 08:05.898
And do not be late

08:05.899 --> 08:08.110
or you may miss the amazing...

08:08.111 --> 08:09.468
Tuckdini!

08:09.469 --> 08:10.845
Ohh.

08:13.137 --> 08:15.795
You'll also be amazed at what I can make...

08:15.796 --> 08:17.122
Disappear.

08:20.610 --> 08:21.834
Oh, I'm gonna need that back.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.852
That's $18 at the magic shop.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.373
Okay, so what the hell
do you think you're doing?

08:28.374 --> 08:30.397
Somebody just shoved this under my door.

08:30.398 --> 08:32.648
Oh, you know, what any good dad would do.

08:32.649 --> 08:35.018
Just trying to help his
little girl make some friends.

08:35.019 --> 08:38.121
And introduce them to the
wonderful world of magic...

08:38.121 --> 08:39.712
Magic magic magic...

08:41.054 --> 08:44.150
But you're doing it at the
exact same time as my play group.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.382
- Oh, am I?
- With all the same people.

08:46.383 --> 08:47.935
Oh, are they?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.080
Everyone is calling to cancel!

08:51.395 --> 08:53.821
Ohh, that is unfortunate.

08:54.755 --> 08:56.529
I hope it doesn't have anything to do with

08:56.530 --> 08:58.927
the Margarita machine, the sandwich bar

08:58.928 --> 09:00.915
or the great Tuckdini.

09:03.406 --> 09:05.916
Aww, a hanky for your tears?

09:07.996 --> 09:09.678
Uh... oh,
my God.

09:10.909 --> 09:11.977
Ha ha!

09:12.400 --> 09:13.984
Oh, my God oh, my...

09:20.922 --> 09:22.759
<i>Ready? Here we go.</i>

09:22.760 --> 09:23.915
Quick quick, slow.

09:23.916 --> 09:25.507
Quick quick, slow.

09:25.508 --> 09:27.138
Quick quick, slow.

09:28.427 --> 09:30.054
Which part is quick and which part is slow?

09:31.428 --> 09:33.603
All of them. You just
gotta listen to the beat.

09:33.604 --> 09:34.689
Which beat?

09:34.690 --> 09:36.497
There is only one.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.523
Okay, you know what? Um,

09:39.524 --> 09:40.990
you just gotta loosen up
your hips a little bit.

09:41.383 --> 09:42.743
Right? Quick quick, slow.

09:43.063 --> 09:44.151
Quick quick, slow.

09:48.249 --> 09:50.294
Okay, so maybe you should
tighten up your hips a little bit.

09:51.385 --> 09:52.614
This is impossible.

09:52.615 --> 09:54.072
<i>- No, here, let's just keep...</i>

09:54.073 --> 09:55.580
ohh! Ohh!

09:56.042 --> 09:57.644
- Okay!
- Hey! Ha ha!

09:58.065 --> 09:59.432
A little Latin beat.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.393
Don't do it, don't do it.

10:02.690 --> 10:03.596
Oh!

10:05.878 --> 10:07.512
- Very nice!
- Spin?

10:07.513 --> 10:08.727
Oh, in.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.872
- Down.
-  Ohh!

10:12.566 --> 10:14.651
Okay!

10:16.377 --> 10:17.795
Aww!

10:18.846 --> 10:19.849
All right! All right, all right!

10:19.850 --> 10:20.897
That's it! Keep it up,

10:20.898 --> 10:22.635
and I'm putting all the
food on the top shelf.

10:22.636 --> 10:24.692
- Ohh!
- Okay!

10:24.693 --> 10:27.384
Well, you better figure out your
rhythm of the night pretty quick...

10:27.385 --> 10:29.845
<i>Because my baby is throwing her first party.</i>

10:29.846 --> 10:31.748
This place is about to be crawling with...

10:32.381 --> 10:33.971
Well, babies.

10:33.972 --> 10:35.309
Yeah.

10:35.310 --> 10:38.506
And I still need to go to the
park, so I can catch something I can

10:38.507 --> 10:39.850
call a rabbit.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.894
All right. Actually,

10:44.415 --> 10:46.885
I have a different idea.
Okay, let's try this.

10:47.308 --> 10:49.255
It will be easier for you to follow me

10:49.642 --> 10:51.607
if you have no choice. All right?

10:51.608 --> 10:54.600
So let's pretend I'm
like your training wheels.

10:55.057 --> 10:56.446
Comfortable?

10:57.237 --> 10:58.483
All right.

10:58.484 --> 10:59.445
Quick quick, slow.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.391
Quick quick, slow.

11:01.392 --> 11:03.392
Quick quick, slow. There you go!

11:04.121 --> 11:05.704
Danny, you're doing great.

11:05.705 --> 11:07.615
Quick... oh oh!

11:08.011 --> 11:09.992
Okay, Danny, are
you... oh, my God!

11:09.993 --> 11:11.350
Danny, Riley?!

11:11.351 --> 11:12.540
Amy, it's not what it looks like!

11:12.541 --> 11:13.638
We're just dancing.

11:14.472 --> 11:15.652
Danny Wheeler...

11:15.653 --> 11:16.977
I never wanna see you again.

11:21.022 --> 11:23.224
Do you want me to translate that for you?

11:23.225 --> 11:25.558
No. I think I got it.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.600
Thank you for coming. Bye-bye now.

11:28.601 --> 11:30.835
This was so much fun! Okay.

11:31.427 --> 11:33.154
Oh, my God. That was brutal.

11:34.098 --> 11:36.609
Was that play group or a plot to kill me?

11:36.955 --> 11:40.172
Okay, that was the worst
two hours of my life.

11:40.173 --> 11:44.471
We should have filmed that and sold
it as a P.S.A. For birth control.

11:45.823 --> 11:48.058
Well, I hope Emma had a good time.

11:48.468 --> 11:51.006
Because my wand sure didn't!

11:51.439 --> 11:53.090
Oh, and I don't even wanna tell you

11:53.091 --> 11:54.591
what I found in my top hat.

11:55.762 --> 11:58.446
Okay, as a mother, I hate to admit this,

11:58.447 --> 12:01.185
but oh, my God, mothers are horrible!

12:01.186 --> 12:02.574
How do you put up with us?

12:02.575 --> 12:03.910
And all that breast-feeding!

12:04.303 --> 12:06.743
I can't believe that
they ruined boobs for me.

12:07.803 --> 12:09.071
Boobs, people!

12:10.726 --> 12:12.682
Yes, they were all pretty obnoxious.

12:12.683 --> 12:14.567
But we have to put up with them for Emma.

12:15.010 --> 12:18.390
God, I just wish there was a way
we could get rid of that Sondra.

12:18.391 --> 12:20.695
She is definitely the worst of the worst.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.673
"Oh, my God,
is this not just the cutest?

12:23.042 --> 12:24.285
You're cute, I'm cute.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.468
Everything's just so cute!"

12:26.304 --> 12:27.767
You know what's not cute?

12:28.077 --> 12:29.264
You!

12:29.619 --> 12:31.264
Sorry we're so awful

12:31.265 --> 12:32.868
and you hate us so much!

12:32.869 --> 12:34.655
No! Sondra, please. I can explain.

12:34.656 --> 12:36.552
Explain? What's there to explain?

12:36.866 --> 12:38.265
Do you know what these are, Ben?

12:38.266 --> 12:39.942
They're ears.

12:39.943 --> 12:41.220
And they heard you loud and clear.

12:41.701 --> 12:43.263
And now, I'm gonna make sure

12:43.264 --> 12:45.416
all the other parents hear
you loud and clear too.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.364
We are never coming back here.

12:47.710 --> 12:48.734
Ever!

12:53.137 --> 12:54.791
You know, now that I think of it...

12:55.521 --> 12:57.646
There might be somebody in the bathroom.

13:00.577 --> 13:02.692
The bar is closed and I'm still pouring.

13:02.693 --> 13:05.003
Get it, get it!

13:05.004 --> 13:06.315
<i>- Oh!
- Oh oh!</i>

13:06.633 --> 13:07.898
Oh!

13:08.699 --> 13:09.948
You're really good at that.

13:11.210 --> 13:13.119
- You know what you're really good at?
- What?

13:13.806 --> 13:15.120
It's a secret.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.096
Okay.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.043
I'm gonna go sit down now.

13:21.044 --> 13:22.163
Okay.

13:27.150 --> 13:29.990
So, what are we gonna toast to this time?

13:30.377 --> 13:31.836
How about...

13:31.837 --> 13:33.602
My inbalility...

13:33.942 --> 13:37.087
To have a normal relationship with Vanessa?

13:39.769 --> 13:41.682
Can anyone else not feel their tongue?

13:43.315 --> 13:46.451
We already drank to that! Like five times.

13:46.886 --> 13:49.021
How about we drink to Amy?

13:49.022 --> 13:52.514
The greatest girl in the world who
will probably never talk to me again.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.059
That was my fault.

13:55.397 --> 13:57.090
We should toast to Emma,

13:57.091 --> 13:59.705
who thanks to her idiot father,

13:59.706 --> 14:02.519
is now gonna be a social
outcast for the rest of her life.

14:04.338 --> 14:06.221
To the idiot father!

14:06.222 --> 14:07.977
- Yeah!
- Thank you, thank you.

14:07.978 --> 14:09.651
You're all an inspiration, yeah.

14:10.287 --> 14:11.672
- Oh! Whoa!
- You know what?

14:12.166 --> 14:15.204
You people are losers.

14:16.763 --> 14:18.520
But it doesn't have to stay like that.

14:19.353 --> 14:21.114
'Cause you just gotta get out there,

14:21.115 --> 14:22.840
and you gotta seize...

14:25.655 --> 14:26.958
What was I just saying?

14:27.371 --> 14:29.108
- Oh, the day!
- Ohh.

14:29.109 --> 14:30.400
You gotta seize the day.

14:30.883 --> 14:34.389
'Cause we're not the kind of
people that stuff happens to.

14:34.390 --> 14:37.945
We're the kind of people
that make stuff happen.

14:38.725 --> 14:40.418
We're stuff happeners.

14:40.419 --> 14:41.378
Damn right.

14:41.379 --> 14:42.567
<i>- Hear hear!
- Damn right.</i>

14:42.568 --> 14:45.534
So you get out there
and you fight for Emma.

14:45.535 --> 14:47.665
Who cares what Kayla thinks of you?

14:47.666 --> 14:49.090
You're an amazing dad.

14:49.091 --> 14:49.986
Thank you.

14:49.987 --> 14:51.726
And can't just let Amy get away.

14:51.727 --> 14:52.713
- Huh?
- No!

14:52.714 --> 14:55.360
You gotta prove that
she's the only one for you!

14:55.361 --> 14:57.588
You know? Go big or go home!

14:57.589 --> 14:59.374
Can you do that?

14:59.375 --> 15:00.662
I can do it.

15:00.663 --> 15:02.019
Because I'm big.

15:03.113 --> 15:05.130
And I've got my address in my cellphone.

15:11.058 --> 15:12.020
Wait wait wait. Wait.

15:13.278 --> 15:14.658
What about me?

15:15.009 --> 15:16.672
What should I do about Vanessa?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.179
You should just

15:18.180 --> 15:19.622
dump her already. Everybody hates her.

15:22.475 --> 15:24.615
To dumping Vanessa!

15:26.715 --> 15:28.397
<i>Ooh, what about this one?</i>

15:28.398 --> 15:30.440
It's a dove with flames for wings.

15:31.229 --> 15:32.734
Or is the dove on fire?

15:33.507 --> 15:35.554
Oh, my God. This heart's on fire too.

15:35.555 --> 15:37.320
Everything in this book is on fire!

15:38.361 --> 15:39.783
No flames.

15:39.784 --> 15:41.723
I think I'm just gonna
get "Amy" on my wrist.

15:41.724 --> 15:43.596
That way she'll know I'm really committed.

15:44.356 --> 15:46.008
You think this is a good idea, right?

15:46.009 --> 15:48.135
Totally. Yes.

15:48.908 --> 15:50.991
It's like the most romantic thing ever.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.830
Oh, what about a skull with a snake?

15:54.419 --> 15:57.012
All right. Ready to do this?

15:57.013 --> 15:58.946
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

15:58.947 --> 16:01.028
Is this gonna hurt?

16:01.029 --> 16:03.596
Yeah, something tells me you
won't be feeling any pain.

16:10.868 --> 16:12.928
Maybe you should wait in the other room.

16:12.929 --> 16:14.795
Yeah, Riley. I don't think you can handle

16:14.796 --> 16:16.623
what's about to go down in here.

16:16.624 --> 16:18.016
This is man stuff.

16:21.056 --> 16:23.500
Yeah, that was just the swab.

16:30.954 --> 16:32.234
Ohh!

16:32.235 --> 16:33.792
Mom's sleeping. Shh.

16:34.101 --> 16:37.357
That was the loudest shush I've ever heard.

16:37.358 --> 16:39.131
You're the loudest shush I've ever heard.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.154
- What does that even mean?!
- I don't know!

16:41.155 --> 16:43.292
It means you should be
out scarfing chili dogs

16:43.293 --> 16:44.802
like regular drunks!

16:44.803 --> 16:46.823
Chili dogs! That's
what we were gonna get!

16:47.259 --> 16:48.543
I love you.

16:49.078 --> 16:50.342
Oh, my God.

16:53.232 --> 16:54.546
- Watch out!
- Ooh!

16:54.547 --> 16:55.669
Oh, my...

16:57.549 --> 16:58.418
You know what?

16:59.289 --> 17:00.416
Riley was right.

17:00.934 --> 17:02.093
This ends now.

17:03.089 --> 17:04.731
Kayla!

17:05.281 --> 17:06.958
I just want everyone to know...

17:07.361 --> 17:09.186
- Shh.
- That Kayla in 5-D

17:09.608 --> 17:10.981
is a bad mom!

17:11.435 --> 17:12.789
She excluded my little girl

17:13.251 --> 17:15.641
from joining her stupid play group.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.452
Shh! Shh!

17:18.009 --> 17:20.252
I'm calling Vanessa and I'm gonna give her

17:20.252 --> 17:21.858
a mind of my piece.

17:22.364 --> 17:23.759
And it's all your fault

17:24.364 --> 17:26.877
that every other mommy in
this building hates me now!

17:27.740 --> 17:31.968
Hey, is it too mean to break up
with someone over a voice-mail?

17:32.324 --> 17:34.826
Oh, crap! That's what I just did.

17:36.738 --> 17:39.151
Ben, it is 3:00 in the morning.

17:39.152 --> 17:42.360
Get in here! I'm not making
out with another cop for you.

17:44.043 --> 17:45.108
No!

17:45.109 --> 17:46.115
I'm not getting in there.

17:46.116 --> 17:47.390
I've got a lot more to say!

17:47.796 --> 17:48.773
Fine.

17:48.774 --> 17:50.472
But I hope you have an umbrella.

17:53.386 --> 17:55.148
- Umbrella?
- That's funny.

17:58.468 --> 17:59.932
Oh, my God!

18:03.156 --> 18:05.082
Mom! No, mom!

18:05.083 --> 18:06.908
<i>Mom!</i>

18:06.909 --> 18:07.866
- Please!
- Mom!

18:07.867 --> 18:09.116
I hope that's officer Gary.

18:09.117 --> 18:11.520
<i>He's got a cloudy eye, but he's a good kisser.</i>

18:15.067 --> 18:16.005
Oh.

18:16.337 --> 18:17.673
Hi, Kayla.

18:17.674 --> 18:19.874
What is your lunatic son doing?

18:19.875 --> 18:22.216
He has to stop screaming
those things about me.

18:22.217 --> 18:24.869
Hmm, the truth hurts,
doesn't it, tinker bell?

18:26.311 --> 18:27.746
I'm not a bad mom.

18:27.747 --> 18:30.181
Really? Because a good mom

18:30.182 --> 18:32.749
wouldn't exclude a little
girl from a play group.

18:33.531 --> 18:35.581
That's at least a pretty insensitive mom

18:35.582 --> 18:36.687
in my book.

18:37.396 --> 18:38.492
Mom!

18:38.493 --> 18:39.632
Shut up, Ben!

18:43.472 --> 18:44.390
Hey, listen,

18:44.807 --> 18:46.538
mom to mom here, okay?

18:46.539 --> 18:48.799
We both know that there isn't anything

18:48.800 --> 18:50.645
that we wouldn't do for our kids.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.737
And sometimes that means

18:52.738 --> 18:55.280
putting up with a parent
that you don't like.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.763
Heck, I hate all of Ben and
Danny's friends' parents,

18:58.764 --> 19:00.989
and they hate me! We're fine with that.

19:00.990 --> 19:02.305
That's what we do!

19:03.413 --> 19:05.635
We make sacrifices for our kids.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.588
And Ben is just like any other parent.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.595
He just wants Emma to be happy.

19:12.108 --> 19:14.409
Fine, Ben and Emma can
come to my play group.

19:15.553 --> 19:16.744
Thank you.

19:17.897 --> 19:20.373
Now do you need help getting back upstairs,

19:20.374 --> 19:22.410
or will your little fairy
wings take you there?

19:23.731 --> 19:25.374
Ooh, maybe this will help.

19:32.633 --> 19:33.887
Good night, Ben!

19:33.888 --> 19:35.289
- No!
- Mom!

19:35.290 --> 19:37.041
- No!
- Why?!

19:41.192 --> 19:43.031
So should we talk about
what happened last night?

19:45.664 --> 19:47.534
It was raining and freezing.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.135
We had no choice.

19:58.541 --> 20:00.237
It was either spoon or die.

20:02.513 --> 20:04.686
Fine. Fine.

20:05.683 --> 20:07.343
But we're never talking about it again.

20:07.344 --> 20:08.572
Nope.

20:09.510 --> 20:10.545
Hey, guys.

20:10.546 --> 20:11.840
Crazy night, huh?

20:11.841 --> 20:12.806
What happened to you?

20:12.807 --> 20:14.245
You and Riley kinda just disappeared.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.620
I decided to make a bold and decisive move.

20:17.052 --> 20:18.858
I got Amy's name tattooed on my wrist.

20:18.859 --> 20:20.574
W-what?!

20:20.575 --> 20:21.680
Are you serious?

20:21.681 --> 20:23.004
Did it hurt?

20:23.336 --> 20:24.676
Not really.

20:24.677 --> 20:26.050
Mainly because I kinda passed out.

20:27.123 --> 20:28.166
I just hopes she likes it.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.108
<i>What do you think?</i>

20:32.828 --> 20:35.406
Honestly, I don't think
Amy's gonna like it.

20:41.036 --> 20:43.403
See? She was just teaching me how to dance.

20:43.404 --> 20:45.799
Well, she did a pretty amazing job.

20:46.973 --> 20:48.132
Listen, I'm...

20:48.910 --> 20:50.638
I'm really sorry I overreacted.

20:51.286 --> 20:53.102
I don't know why I can't
shake the thought that...

20:53.535 --> 20:55.080
You have feelings for Riley.

20:55.081 --> 20:57.389
Me?! No, that's crazy.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.938
Why would you think that?

20:58.939 --> 20:59.974
You're right.

20:59.975 --> 21:01.249
I'm just being a girl.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.278
Riley Riley Riley.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.937
I think I just have to
get it out of my head.

21:08.729 --> 21:09.934
Yeah, me too.

21:09.935 --> 21:15.474
