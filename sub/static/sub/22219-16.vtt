you know I just was trying to represent

13:04.890 --> 13:08.490
myself the best way that I could you

13:06.180 --> 13:11.520
know so if you thought you were doing

13:08.490 --> 13:12.900
better would you hung in there not cuz

13:11.520 --> 13:15.660
in the moment I felt like I was given

13:12.900 --> 13:18.480
impossible you know things to do like

13:15.660 --> 13:20.520
palm tattoos realistic palm tattoos like

13:18.480 --> 13:22.470
yeah that's impossible you know we all

13:20.520 --> 13:24.720
expected to see you up there man

13:22.470 --> 13:26.970
I expected me to be up there Wow Oliver

13:24.720 --> 13:30.600
as the opposing team leader what's your

13:26.970 --> 13:32.070
take on this man I mean for him being on

13:30.600 --> 13:35.130
the other team it's great that he quit

13:32.070 --> 13:36.870
but a lot of people a lot of people work

13:35.130 --> 13:38.760
hard to be here and for someone to just

13:36.870 --> 13:41.250
to walk out it's pretty upsetting man

13:38.760 --> 13:43.230
well Eric you got eliminated right

13:41.250 --> 13:45.480
before sketchy quit I mean what are your

13:43.230 --> 13:47.250
thoughts I mean yeah I thought it was a

13:45.480 --> 13:49.590
pretty wack move on his behalf but you

13:47.250 --> 13:51.990
know I was really sick but you know I

13:49.590 --> 13:54.240
finished my tattoo and I did my best to

13:51.990 --> 13:56.010
stay in the competition but right you

13:54.240 --> 13:58.410
know if he knew he was gonna leave you

13:56.010 --> 14:01.200
know when I got eliminated I probably

13:58.410 --> 14:03.330
could have stayed sketchy I mean it

14:01.200 --> 14:06.240
wasn't premeditated you know after I did

14:03.330 --> 14:08.820
that tattoo you know I felt like I was

14:06.240 --> 14:10.200
being thrown under the bus and it was

14:08.820 --> 14:12.360
just a decision I was in the moment do

14:10.200 --> 14:13.800
you still think that looking back at the

14:12.360 --> 14:15.600
show and seeing how well I was doing I

14:13.800 --> 14:17.310
mean I should have started up a little

14:15.600 --> 14:19.110
bit more you know I wanted to you guys

14:17.310 --> 14:20.790
saw that I wanted to stir it up man some

14:19.110 --> 14:22.320
people didn't to play well Chris you're

14:20.790 --> 14:24.330
the team leader I mean what's your take

14:22.320 --> 14:27.450
on all this well look for me it was a

14:24.330 --> 14:30.450
major hit to lose sketchy it was a major

14:27.450 --> 14:32.610
hit to lose Eric it was a big hit really

14:30.450 --> 14:34.740
every time somebody on my team left I

14:32.610 --> 14:36.630
lost John early a lot of things happen

14:34.740 --> 14:38.400
where I picked the team that I really

14:36.630 --> 14:39.960
felt and don't have any regrets about

14:38.400 --> 14:42.540
picking I felt a wholeheartedly was a

14:39.960 --> 14:43.920
great team so you know if I had to do it

14:42.540 --> 14:45.780
all over again I'd picked the same crew

14:43.920 --> 14:46.520
and I want you to stay and I hope you

14:45.780 --> 14:51.070
with me

14:46.520 --> 14:54.380
yeah good for me ah anything dad

14:51.070 --> 14:56.360
anything dad sketchy no I mean I did

14:54.380 --> 14:58.550
what I did and you know I I stand behind

14:56.360 --> 15:00.460
what I do well you weren't the only one

14:58.550 --> 15:03.370
who had a hard time being on a team

15:00.460 --> 15:07.779
Kevin

15:03.370 --> 15:10.000
[Applause]

15:07.779 --> 15:15.069
Kevin Leroy let's have a chat man how

15:10.000 --> 15:18.189
was it for you it teams only really work

15:15.069 --> 15:20.829
for me that well especially you know

15:18.189 --> 15:23.740
when when the team captain likes to play

15:20.829 --> 15:27.610
favorites sometimes you know yeah it

15:23.740 --> 15:29.800
only workout but but all in all you know

15:27.610 --> 15:33.790
Chris is really good at what he does and

15:29.800 --> 15:35.379
I feel like I feel like he tried to give

15:33.790 --> 15:37.750
me a lot of good a lot of good tips but

15:35.379 --> 15:39.399
in this industry it's more like a like a

15:37.750 --> 15:41.500
rapper trying to tell an opera singer

15:39.399 --> 15:43.449
how to sing is that we're both the music

15:41.500 --> 15:46.089
but you do something complete different

15:43.449 --> 15:48.220
in what I do Chris well I here's the

15:46.089 --> 15:50.350
thing being the first time that we've

15:48.220 --> 15:52.300
ever been able to give you guys help or

15:50.350 --> 15:53.889
ideas you have to check you the ego at

15:52.300 --> 15:55.269
the door you have to leave it behind and

15:53.889 --> 15:57.399
this is a place where you come and you

15:55.269 --> 15:58.750
get challenged and tested and I'm trying

15:57.399 --> 16:01.269
to feed the information that will get

15:58.750 --> 16:03.279
you further in the competition but when

16:01.269 --> 16:04.810
you don't take the information it's like

16:03.279 --> 16:06.399
all coaches you have a team of players

16:04.810 --> 16:08.500
that start and you have people that end

16:06.399 --> 16:14.589
up on the bench not taking the advice

16:08.500 --> 16:17.379
puts you on the bench they start when we

16:14.589 --> 16:19.420
come back the three finalists are gonna

16:17.379 --> 16:21.430
finish their live tattoos and voting

16:19.420 --> 16:23.230

16:21.430 --> 16:26.139
the bottom of this female Alliance thing

16:23.230 --> 16:27.090
that has everyone up in arms you don't

16:26.139 --> 16:34.330
want to miss it

16:27.090 --> 16:47.289
[Applause]

16:34.330 --> 16:47.289
[Music]

16:51.200 --> 17:04.169

17:12.810 --> 17:16.579
how's Ryan doing well let me tell you

17:15.480 --> 17:19.140
Dave

17:16.579 --> 17:22.109
Ryan's over here doing her thing and she

17:19.140 --> 17:25.349
has put in so much detail and beautiful

17:22.109 --> 17:26.700
elegant working of this tattoo it's it's

17:25.349 --> 17:28.770
really what we were missing from her

17:26.700 --> 17:30.810
work all season long I think her fans

17:28.770 --> 17:33.510
are gonna be super stoked to see this

17:30.810 --> 17:36.710
when it's done and she's looking right

17:33.510 --> 17:36.710
on the target the finishing

17:39.960 --> 17:46.590
I mean Ollie this is a historic moment

17:43.139 --> 17:50.129
we've never had two women competing in

17:46.590 --> 17:51.840
the live finale Chris how's your only

17:50.129 --> 17:53.639
hope for a win doing over there it's

17:51.840 --> 17:56.460
secured brother she's making a beautiful

17:53.639 --> 17:58.470
portrait of you and Kelly all season has

17:56.460 --> 18:00.740
done nothing but impress us with her

17:58.470 --> 18:03.119
drawing skills and her tattooing Kelly

18:00.740 --> 18:05.549
always seems to design and make

18:03.119 --> 18:07.080
beautiful art on paper and on skin and

18:05.549 --> 18:08.909
I'm confident in her work first her

18:07.080 --> 18:10.860
minute and just on subject matter alone

18:08.909 --> 18:15.269
she's knocking it out of the park hey we

18:10.860 --> 18:18.080
know how to play Holi how's Jeon doing

18:15.269 --> 18:18.080
well

18:21.590 --> 18:28.500
like I said earlier neons never been in

18:26.010 --> 18:29.940
the bottom and this tattoo would

18:28.500 --> 18:33.059
definitely not gonna sit in the bottom

18:29.940 --> 18:35.669
this thing is smooth as ice solid and

18:33.059 --> 18:37.260
clean and he's going totally out of his

18:35.669 --> 18:39.150
comfort zone doing a Japanese tattoo

18:37.260 --> 18:48.480
that I think Chris Nunez would be proud

18:39.150 --> 18:50.520
of he has got a lot of fans out there

18:48.480 --> 18:52.710
and it's for a very good reason yeah he

18:50.520 --> 18:55.380
does all right finally once you have

18:52.710 --> 18:58.080
less than 10 minutes to finish your live

18:55.380 --> 19:00.000
tattoos before voting opens and while

18:58.080 --> 19:02.370
you're doing that we're gonna get back

19:00.000 --> 19:09.179
to this battle of the sexes thing check

19:02.370 --> 19:12.450
it out to think about three women in

19:09.179 --> 19:14.250
finale I want a girl to win this year we

19:12.450 --> 19:16.410
should be hunting these boys and we need

19:14.250 --> 19:18.720
to come at them from every side battle

19:16.410 --> 19:20.070
of the sexes they pick one person they

19:18.720 --> 19:22.380
go after them and they're plucking them

19:20.070 --> 19:23.460
off Dave you do not have what it takes

19:22.380 --> 19:25.860
to be inkmaster

serve on Tito please pack your machines

19:25.860 --> 19:30.350

19:30.350 --> 19:34.130
if you get dear to the bottom so you

19:31.760 --> 19:36.230
were completely crumble it's done it's

19:34.130 --> 19:38.060
baffling that Gio's down here yeah you

19:38.060 --> 19:41.830
master

19:39.429 --> 19:43.570
are you kidding me right now I thought

19:41.830 --> 19:45.639
you was going down there and you know

19:43.570 --> 19:48.070
what most of the people except the girls

19:48.070 --> 19:53.739

19:59.499 --> 20:02.849
strongest female presence we ever had in

20:01.539 --> 20:06.009
this competition

20:02.849 --> 20:07.960
these boys why the boys why not Kelly

20:06.009 --> 20:09.789

20:07.960 --> 20:12.039
the 8th round of this competition and

20:09.789 --> 20:13.899
there hasn't been a female to win you I

20:12.039 --> 20:18.460
don't really know what it's like stop

20:13.899 --> 20:21.039
playing the vagina cards on the card I'm

20:18.460 --> 20:23.139
not cool with that dude y'all win then

20:21.039 --> 20:24.429
you know what congratulations it doesn't

20:23.139 --> 20:29.249
matter if it's a guy or a girl

20:24.429 --> 20:29.249
no way man I pull the white card

20:39.180 --> 20:43.980
all right well let's get to the bottom

20:41.010 --> 20:46.890
of this whole thing gyah how did the

20:43.980 --> 20:49.500
whole female alliance thing started well

20:46.890 --> 20:52.260
we were all really strong and talented

20:49.500 --> 20:53.460
tattooers and when it came to be clear

20:52.260 --> 20:55.320
that we were the strongest in the house

20:53.460 --> 20:57.090
we decided to form an alliance to

20:55.320 --> 20:59.880
support each other rather than tear each

20:57.090 --> 21:02.790
other down and when the dudes caught a

20:59.880 --> 21:04.740
caught wind of a female alliance they

21:02.790 --> 21:06.960
got super paranoid and we just took

21:04.740 --> 21:09.540
advantage of that well let me ask Dave

21:06.960 --> 21:12.630
man Dave do you feel that you got taken

21:09.540 --> 21:15.390
down by the female Alliance well my

21:12.630 --> 21:19.080
first mistake is I ruffled the girls

21:15.390 --> 21:21.590
feathers yeah you know I sensed that

21:19.080 --> 21:23.940
there was a female alliance forming and

21:21.590 --> 21:26.910
you know I just didn't play my cards

21:23.940 --> 21:28.620
right I ended up making enemies with the

21:26.910 --> 21:30.660
girls and that ultimately sealed my fate

21:28.620 --> 21:32.070
I had nothing to do with you making

21:30.660 --> 21:39.420
enemies at all I had everything to do

21:32.070 --> 21:41.580
with you being a two-faced weasel since

21:39.420 --> 21:44.460
we got here this is ink master not

21:41.580 --> 21:45.610
crybaby master

21:44.460 --> 21:48.510
[Applause]

21:45.610 --> 21:51.760
because there are two women up there Oh

21:48.510 --> 21:53.770
Mike let me go to you man you seem like

21:51.760 --> 21:56.350
you played both sides how did you manage

21:53.770 --> 21:58.120
to do that man oh I was cool with

21:56.350 --> 22:00.270
everybody I just didn't like sitting

21:58.120 --> 22:02.710
there listening the guys talk about

22:00.270 --> 22:10.150
going after the women just because

22:02.710 --> 22:11.679
they're women so now there was

22:10.150 --> 22:13.030
definitely some stuff going on he was

22:11.679 --> 22:14.620
going to leaking information to the

22:13.030 --> 22:16.870
females I didn't feel like he ever tried

22:14.620 --> 22:19.179
to make an alliance with the guys so it

22:16.870 --> 22:20.799
was apparent to us that you were feeding

22:19.179 --> 22:22.690
the girls information it looked like you

22:20.799 --> 22:26.260
were part of team the girls that's true

22:22.690 --> 22:28.419
I was of the girls Alliance at all you

22:26.260 --> 22:30.850
can ask any of them I don't care if they

22:28.419 --> 22:31.270
hand Alliance I was there for myself the

22:30.850 --> 22:33.660
whole time

22:31.270 --> 22:36.680
you made them smoothies in the morning

22:33.660 --> 22:38.600
[Applause]

22:36.680 --> 22:41.740
[Music]

22:38.600 --> 22:41.740
[Applause]

22:41.880 --> 22:48.549
if they wanted one let me ask you I just

22:47.020 --> 22:50.919
didn't like when it started to get

22:48.549 --> 22:53.830
disrespectful like what bomb face said

22:50.919 --> 22:55.660
to Nikki I felt like that was a terrible

22:53.830 --> 22:59.530
thing to say you got that cross the line

22:55.660 --> 23:02.260
bone face let me ask you do that I don't

22:59.530 --> 23:04.480
have any regrets I'm not saying that you

23:02.260 --> 23:08.860
I don't have any regrets here's the air

23:04.480 --> 23:11.530
right here I'm confident in the way I

23:08.860 --> 23:13.630
carry myself throughout the competition

23:11.530 --> 23:15.220
I felt like they were using tattoos to

23:13.630 --> 23:17.020
attack me personally and that the insult

23:15.220 --> 23:20.380
was earned so I felt like I was

23:17.020 --> 23:21.190
basically forced into it Nikki how do

23:20.380 --> 23:24.390
you respond to that

23:21.190 --> 23:24.390
he looked lovely by the way

23:27.140 --> 23:34.760
I was never trying to personally insult

23:32.090 --> 23:36.740
bone face if he did a bad tattoo I'm

23:34.760 --> 23:39.410
gonna call him out on it and this is

23:36.740 --> 23:41.060
exactly why us girls came together we

23:39.410 --> 23:43.070
wanted to prove that we could go far in

23:41.060 --> 23:45.680
our skills and our looks should have

23:43.070 --> 23:47.510
nothing to do with it and if you had a

23:45.680 --> 23:50.030
problem with me you could have just

23:47.510 --> 24:01.010
tried to out tattoo me but you couldn't

23:50.030 --> 24:03.690
[Applause]

24:01.010 --> 24:06.660
I'm gonna say this it's easy to jump

24:03.690 --> 24:08.490
somebody four against one you know if

24:06.660 --> 24:13.050
you're in a gang and you jump somebody

24:08.490 --> 24:15.540
four against one's always gonna win over

24:13.050 --> 24:16.650
101 Chris what's your take on the female

24:15.540 --> 24:18.900
Alliance I mean this is your team

24:16.650 --> 24:21.540
talking here look I mean I think overall

24:18.900 --> 24:23.040
the females Alliance plays in a

24:21.540 --> 24:25.380
psychological way we're playing a game

24:23.040 --> 24:28.050
in that sense that worked for everybody

24:25.380 --> 24:30.090
but Kevin pointed it out this is a solo

24:28.050 --> 24:32.280
sport when your hands touch your client

24:30.090 --> 24:36.800
it's on you Nicki you tattooed your ass

24:32.280 --> 24:36.800
off all season I was a fan of your work

24:40.480 --> 24:44.470
I don't buy I never buy into

24:42.639 --> 24:46.210
personalities to the show because I

24:44.470 --> 24:47.919
can't get really close or personal to

24:46.210 --> 24:49.840
anybody I like everybody to just show

24:47.919 --> 24:51.249
off what they can do by their work so we

24:49.840 --> 24:51.940
really don't subscribe to what goes on

24:51.249 --> 24:54.129
upstairs

24:51.940 --> 24:55.840
well let's ask Oliver what what are your

24:54.129 --> 24:58.779
thoughts on all this man man I think

24:55.840 --> 25:00.940
that it's a game and the girls played

24:58.779 --> 25:09.129
the game and some of the people got

25:00.940 --> 25:12.759
played well serve on why didn't the guys

25:09.129 --> 25:14.259
just form an alliance I think from the

25:12.759 --> 25:17.200
jump the girls realized there was no

25:14.259 --> 25:19.090
female ink master and to do that if they

25:17.200 --> 25:20.739
join forces made in life they were

25:19.090 --> 25:22.989
pushing further than the competition

25:20.739 --> 25:25.210
meanwhile the guys realized from the

25:22.989 --> 25:26.950
jump with the without your teams it's

25:25.210 --> 25:28.239
only gonna be one winner and to get to

25:26.950 --> 25:31.749
the end you gotta do clean tattoos the

25:28.239 --> 25:32.639
same way Jia do it and not not look for

25:31.749 --> 25:35.230
the lux

25:32.639 --> 25:35.730
Jian let me throw to you man you got a

25:35.230 --> 25:38.320
minute

25:35.730 --> 25:41.580
you're the only guy left in the

25:38.320 --> 25:41.580
competition do you agree with that

25:45.220 --> 25:51.559
Gian you agree with that I didn't hear

25:49.940 --> 25:54.309
you sorry all right well let me go to

25:51.559 --> 25:57.140
Nicky then Nicky what are your thoughts

25:54.309 --> 25:57.440
in the end you know what it's not about

25:57.140 --> 25:59.780
us

25:57.440 --> 26:02.270
targeting out anybody it was really

25:59.780 --> 26:04.610
about us girls supporting each other

26:02.270 --> 26:06.650
this alliance was kind of thought up

26:04.610 --> 26:07.640
whenever the guys started to see that we

26:06.650 --> 26:10.640
became friends

26:07.640 --> 26:12.860
we didn't care about who was going to

26:10.640 --> 26:14.240
win we just wanted one of us to win cuz

26:12.860 --> 26:16.660
we're friends all right well let's see

26:14.240 --> 26:20.660
if the Alliance worked out all right

26:16.660 --> 26:23.059
because if I'm not mistaken time is

26:20.660 --> 26:25.520

31:35.830 --> 31:42.040
close up it is super clean the outline

31:38.890 --> 31:43.900
is unbeatable saturation the color is

31:42.040 --> 31:45.760
really solid and the layout of the

31:43.900 --> 31:48.820
design is really nice it fits her leg

31:45.760 --> 31:51.070
and it's it's a it's a pretty big tattoo

31:48.820 --> 31:53.700
and you've got a lot of detail in it

31:51.070 --> 31:58.020
great job man great job

[Applause]

32:14.750 --> 32:19.520
okay Ryan you're assigned to fine line

32:17.299 --> 32:21.080
black and gray which is your specialty

32:19.520 --> 32:23.539
let's check out the judges Holly

32:21.080 --> 32:25.190
thoughts pariah well Ryan I wish the

32:23.539 --> 32:26.419
picture on the screen was a little bit

32:25.190 --> 32:28.400
out of focus because when you look at

32:26.419 --> 32:31.190
this tattoo up close it is so much

32:28.400 --> 32:33.289
detail and so much line work the fact

32:31.190 --> 32:34.940
that you were the fact you were able to

32:33.289 --> 32:37.940
put that much into it this amount of

32:34.940 --> 32:40.789
time was a pretty big risk but it came

32:37.940 --> 32:41.690
out super smooth it really shows your

32:40.789 --> 32:44.000
own style

32:41.690 --> 32:45.740
in it and it's really cool that you got

32:44.000 --> 32:47.360
to do something to be all yourself and

32:45.740 --> 32:49.350
for your last tattoo on the show

32:47.360 --> 32:58.620
congratulations

32:49.350 --> 33:00.990
[Applause]

32:58.620 --> 33:03.000

33:00.990 --> 33:05.309
something to really show off and let us

33:05.309 --> 33:09.480

33:07.500 --> 33:12.120
that lines you right up in that category

33:09.480 --> 33:13.890
you've had a great outing the question

33:12.120 --> 33:16.350
is fine line black and gray there's a

33:13.890 --> 33:17.880
lot of bold lines in there and I just

33:16.350 --> 33:19.920
feel like you stepped a little bit out

33:17.880 --> 33:22.530
of what was asked but again an amazing

33:19.920 --> 33:26.300
tattoo just the word fine line comes to

33:22.530 --> 33:29.400
mind all right Ryan thank you step back

38:37.550 --> 38:41.270
competition has ever seen I mean that's

38:39.410 --> 38:43.340
pretty huge for you which they've got

38:41.270 --> 38:45.560
regular world and to say this is the

38:43.340 --> 38:47.390
best Japanese we've seen on ink master

38:45.560 --> 38:49.370
other than rubendall doing his tattoo

38:47.390 --> 38:51.110
this is this is it this is the best

38:49.370 --> 38:53.240
tattoo we've seen on ink master for

38:51.110 --> 38:55.160
Japanese style so you have two

38:53.240 --> 38:55.940
incredibly different tattoos going

38:55.160 --> 38:58.760
head-to-head

38:55.940 --> 38:59.330
oh man it's tough you know Oliver how

38:58.760 --> 39:03.650
about you

38:59.330 --> 39:06.110
I mean Kelly's Kelly Kelly's artistry

39:03.650 --> 39:08.900
has never been in doubt and this tattoo

39:06.110 --> 39:10.760
is got her name written all over it you

39:08.900 --> 39:12.620
everybody sees it knows how to work and

39:10.760 --> 39:18.980
know it's her and it's smooth like every

39:12.620 --> 39:22.790
tattoo she does Jeon again clean solid

39:18.980 --> 39:26.180
tattoo just like he did just like he did

39:22.790 --> 39:27.740
all season long except he went that

39:26.180 --> 39:29.450
extra step and wanted to prove he could

39:27.740 --> 39:31.730
do something else other than what he

39:29.450 --> 39:33.680
always does he did he took a Japanese

39:31.730 --> 39:36.710
challenge to himself instead of takin

39:33.680 --> 39:39.140
the same thing that this is normal we

39:36.710 --> 39:42.260
huh wheelhouse and I think that I mean

39:39.140 --> 39:45.250
both tattoos are great jion's tattoo is

39:42.260 --> 39:45.250
pretty flawless man

39:47.720 --> 39:52.650
we have those spots in those centers of

39:50.400 --> 39:54.630
the maples and debatably they could be

39:52.650 --> 39:57.030
negative or debatably they're undone

39:54.630 --> 39:59.910
this is a time management challenge that

39:57.030 --> 40:04.200
tattoo is well I mean he said it's done

39:59.910 --> 40:06.210
right and I would say with more time and

40:04.200 --> 40:07.530
another sitting Kelly would do more to

40:06.210 --> 40:09.150
this there's elements in this tattoo

40:07.530 --> 40:12.330
that I think would but what starers

40:09.150 --> 40:13.710
finished on denied you guys can't get

40:12.330 --> 40:15.960
into this finished unfinished business

40:13.710 --> 40:17.610
again I mean this is what we got we've

40:15.960 --> 40:18.600
already been down this road I'm not

40:17.610 --> 40:20.940
gonna go down that road again

40:18.600 --> 40:23.240
so I need a final decision for you

40:20.940 --> 40:23.240
Oliver

40:31.860 --> 40:38.160
I hear you man

40:36.480 --> 40:41.220

40:49.670 --> 40:52.780

creative designs and they showed their

43:19.200 --> 43:23.640
own style throughout and it's it's been

45:12.310 --> 45:23.080
canvas went Ryan I would love to see

45:18.850 --> 45:25.680
dueling hot rods big chunky 90s

45:23.080 --> 45:25.680
new-school

45:31.130 --> 45:39.420
are you ready ready this is your new

45:35.640 --> 45:40.710
testes cool right excited I have a lot

45:39.420 --> 45:45.180
more to prove

45:40.710 --> 45:47.490
are you new school was the one challenge

45:45.180 --> 45:50.550
that everyone else in the finale did

45:47.490 --> 45:55.010
that I didn't do I'm gonna breathing

45:50.550 --> 45:58.470
it's literally the opposite of my style

45:55.010 --> 46:00.980
vibrant right color thick chunky lines I

45:58.470 --> 46:03.980
don't do anything like that

46:00.980 --> 46:05.750
you got this this really is the tattoo

46:03.980 --> 46:07.510
that's going to make it or break it for

46:05.750 --> 46:10.570
me 11 minutes

46:07.510 --> 46:14.350
I've made it this far because I busted

46:10.570 --> 46:17.220
my ass I deserve to be the first female

46:14.350 --> 46:17.220
ink master

46:25.910 --> 46:33.640
all right it is the moment of truth Ryan

46:28.700 --> 46:33.640
please reveal your master canvas

46:35.840 --> 46:48.529
[Applause]

46:44.079 --> 46:51.339
hi Ryan tell us about this well Kelly

46:48.529 --> 46:51.339
assigned me

46:52.970 --> 46:58.190
because it's the opposite of what I

46:55.220 --> 47:02.599
normally do and I feel like she assigned

46:58.190 --> 47:04.339
it to me because she basically wanted me

47:02.599 --> 47:07.040
to prove that if I deserved the

47:04.339 --> 47:09.290
inkmaster title I should be able to you

47:07.040 --> 47:11.569
know tackle any style and handle any

47:09.290 --> 47:14.630
challenge that was thrown at me so I

47:11.569 --> 47:17.300
think you know this challenge was the

47:14.630 --> 47:22.430
opposite of what I've been expected to

47:17.300 --> 47:26.349
do and I you know did it as as true to

47:22.430 --> 47:28.940
the challenge as I could I trained with

47:26.349 --> 47:32.230
coil machines for a few weeks before I

47:28.940 --> 47:35.839
attempted it I started using steel tubes

47:32.230 --> 47:38.540
and I practiced before I even attempted

47:35.839 --> 47:45.920
it and the artwork took me a very long

47:38.540 --> 47:49.520
time I mean aside from just Oliver let's

47:45.920 --> 47:51.890
hear from you well I gotta say man this

47:49.520 --> 47:53.810
was one tough challenge for you

47:51.890 --> 47:54.740
especially I mean this style is

47:53.810 --> 47:56.720
something that you weren't even

47:54.740 --> 47:59.869
tattooing when this style was prevalent

47:56.720 --> 48:01.250
I remember the 90s I remember tattooing

47:59.869 --> 48:03.609
and tattoo conventions with cleen Rock

48:01.250 --> 48:07.250
when he was doing all this stuff and I

48:03.609 --> 48:09.140
mean this this is it you could go this

48:07.250 --> 48:11.800
is a time machine tattoo right here

48:09.140 --> 48:11.800
you know you

48:18.420 --> 48:23.400
she was done the line work the color the

48:20.940 --> 48:24.779
solid the bright the color play of

48:23.400 --> 48:27.680
making the chrome with the weird

48:24.779 --> 48:30.839
highlights nailed it

48:27.680 --> 48:33.630
Chris your thoughts well you know this

48:30.839 --> 48:36.089
tattoo it really it does exude 90s it

48:33.630 --> 48:38.130
does have that really 90s feel I also

48:36.089 --> 48:40.769
this is my 25th year tattooing I grew up

48:38.130 --> 48:43.019
on this so looking at this artwork the

48:40.769 --> 48:46.049
outline quality the color quality the

48:43.019 --> 48:48.150
color palette and play it really sets

48:46.049 --> 48:50.160
off a strong 90s presence look for me

48:48.150 --> 48:52.950
really hits it is the use of the chrome

48:50.160 --> 48:54.480
because we were really chrome babies in

48:52.950 --> 48:57.569
the 90s we would make anything chrome

48:54.480 --> 49:01.010
and you captured that look in this 90s

48:57.569 --> 49:01.010
filled tattoo I think he did a great job

49:01.090 --> 49:11.150
[Applause]

49:08.089 --> 49:13.400
because we'll have to say and then the

49:11.150 --> 49:16.999
moment we've all been waiting for one

49:13.400 --> 49:18.829
artist will be awarded $100,000 and the

49:16.999 --> 49:19.970
title of ink master

49:18.829 --> 49:26.230
stay tuned

49:19.970 --> 49:26.990
[Applause]

49:26.230 --> 49:32.610
[Music]

49:26.990 --> 49:32.610
[Applause]

49:42.010 --> 49:48.190
welcome back that's alive

49:45.490 --> 49:53.530

49:55.450 --> 50:01.680
hour master canvas but first let's take

49:58.780 --> 50:01.680

50:12.450 --> 50:18.040

50:18.040 --> 50:22.900
it's so tight I'm just doing the

50:20.830 --> 50:24.700
watercolour drips on the sides I'm gonna

50:22.900 --> 50:26.170
use all my traditional skills and I'm

50:24.700 --> 50:32.140
gonna try to make this thing look like a

50:26.170 --> 50:34.450
watercolor painting I want to prove to

50:32.140 --> 50:37.480
America that Perico has some badass

50:58.240 --> 51:01.630

51:00.400 --> 51:04.090
the power plant it's the state of

51:01.630 --> 51:06.280
emergency that was completely ready to

51:04.090 --> 51:08.950

51:06.280 --> 51:15.670
me out of my focus on our fingers

crossed we got the power back on do this

51:15.670 --> 51:17.880

51:18.180 --> 51:23.580
going against these girls I still think

51:21.030 --> 51:25.530
I got a chance I would love for there to

51:23.580 --> 51:29.480
be a female ink master just not this

time around may the best man win

51:57.210 --> 52:03.610
yeah what was your plan here man I mean

52:00.010 --> 52:05.440
that was a tough ask from Kelly what was

52:03.610 --> 52:08.620
your plan that was a what

52:05.440 --> 52:10.810
what was your plan you know I was really

52:08.620 --> 52:12.490
nervous at first but after thinking

52:10.810 --> 52:14.620
about it I was kind of excited you know

52:12.490 --> 52:17.560
it just gave me the opportunity to show

52:14.620 --> 52:19.350
that I'm very diverse and that I got

52:17.560 --> 52:22.150
what it takes to be ink master

52:19.350 --> 52:24.010
all right Chris what are you talking

52:22.150 --> 52:26.320

52:27.820 --> 52:33.340
Oliver pointed that out and you have

52:29.920 --> 52:35.140
steadily been able to really push your

52:33.340 --> 52:36.550
craft and really show people that you

52:35.140 --> 52:39.610
know how to apply solid tattoos that

heal really well this tattoo is really

52:39.610 --> 52:44.560
strong from you man the color palette on

52:41.380 --> 52:46.690

52:44.560 --> 52:49.060
of beautiful detail to it

52:46.690 --> 52:51.040
the standalone skull the placement of it

52:49.060 --> 52:52.480
really you know it shows itself it

52:51.040 --> 52:53.830
doesn't get lost in the piece and I

52:52.480 --> 52:54.930
think you did an overall beautiful

52:53.830 --> 52:58.030
tattoo

52:54.930 --> 52:59.320
Oliver thoughts for Gian well G on the

52:58.030 --> 53:01.480
first thing I'm going to say is that

52:59.320 --> 53:06.040
this challenge of doing a watercolor

53:01.480 --> 53:08.830
coral reef was insane and you were set

53:06.040 --> 53:10.570
up to fail but you instead you turned it

53:08.830 --> 53:13.900
around and you did a beautiful tattoo

53:10.570 --> 53:15.700
and for those who for those people that

53:13.900 --> 53:18.100
might debate whether this is the

53:15.700 --> 53:19.960
watercolor tattoo I want to remind them

53:18.100 --> 53:24.060
that every piece of Sailor Jerry flash

53:19.960 --> 53:24.060
on the wall is a watercolor painting

53:26.190 --> 53:31.030
the dis is now a two words watercolor

53:28.990 --> 53:33.490
tattooers watercolor with outlines

53:31.030 --> 53:36.550
tattooers color with black and this

53:33.490 --> 53:39.100
tattoo has that soft fluid color

53:36.550 --> 53:41.290
blending that really looks like a

53:39.100 --> 53:42.760
painting that we would do not what

53:41.290 --> 53:44.470
people are thinking of of watercolor

53:42.760 --> 53:46.690
painting that will be in the museum but

53:44.470 --> 53:49.960
the detail on this tattoo is amazing the

53:46.690 --> 53:52.780
outline is solid the color saturation is

53:49.960 --> 53:58.380
beautiful management it is a top-notch

53:52.780 --> 53:58.380
tattoo all right gr thank you

54:01.110 --> 54:05.590

the judges have a huge decision to make

54:08.890 --> 54:12.060

54:13.160 --> 54:17.420
[Applause]

54:29.290 --> 54:32.010
welcome back

54:32.550 --> 54:37.980
cuties and pick by Oliver Peck Chris

54:34.980 --> 54:41.150
Nunez battled it out all season long and

54:37.980 --> 54:44.790

54:41.150 --> 54:46.850
all right eliminated artists all season

54:44.790 --> 54:49.530

54:46.850 --> 54:51.810
critiquing each other's work now Kelly

54:49.530 --> 54:55.800
let me ask you I mean you assigned both

54:51.810 --> 54:58.680
of these what are your thoughts I came

54:55.800 --> 55:00.990
for both of them I wanted a knock both

54:58.680 --> 55:04.890
of them out and I gave him everything I

55:00.990 --> 55:07.590
had and they gave it right back

55:04.890 --> 55:10.530
they both did beautiful tattoos what do

55:07.590 --> 55:12.450
you want for me did they hit the

55:10.530 --> 55:14.670
challenges as far as you're concerned I

55:12.450 --> 55:18.170
mean this is this is your moment to

55:14.670 --> 55:21.360
chime in on them hitting the challenges

55:18.170 --> 55:26.100
they they both did it

55:21.360 --> 55:29.370
Gyan did a watercolor tattoo he did not

55:26.100 --> 55:32.760
want to do a watercolor tattoo of coral

55:29.370 --> 55:36.870
eye I could hear him gnashing his teeth

55:32.760 --> 55:40.230
when I said it and same for Ryan I gave

55:36.870 --> 55:45.170
her everything she hated because I was

55:40.230 --> 55:49.320
inside her head they both killed it I

55:45.170 --> 55:53.210
don't have a decision sorry they they

55:49.320 --> 55:53.210
both killed it okay

55:58.280 --> 56:02.090
the jury appears man you know I'm always

56:01.160 --> 56:04.490
down to chime in

56:02.090 --> 56:05.540
first of all Gianna I felt like kept it

56:04.490 --> 56:07.310
real the whole time

56:05.540 --> 56:10.099
he didn't need an alliance to carry him

56:07.310 --> 56:12.470
he did every single tattoo never went to

56:10.099 --> 56:16.570
the bottom I mean if I got a pick an ink

56:12.470 --> 56:16.570
master is Giancarlo standing right there

56:18.700 --> 56:23.930
okay man it is a tough room

56:21.800 --> 56:26.800
I'm fair enough guys ultimately the

56:23.930 --> 56:30.200
decision lies in the hands of the judges

56:26.800 --> 56:34.420
all right Gian and Ryan one of you is

56:30.200 --> 56:40.270
about to win it all on the line is

56:34.420 --> 56:44.869
$100,000 a feature in Inked Magazine a

56:40.270 --> 56:51.070
guest spot in Oliver's shop a Dodge

56:44.869 --> 56:51.070
Charger and the title of ink master

56:51.490 --> 56:57.050
judges we got to make a decision

56:55.099 --> 56:59.190
running out of time

56:57.050 --> 57:01.070
I'm not gonna I'm gonna go to Chris

56:59.190 --> 57:03.270
first Chris were you have thoughts in

57:01.070 --> 57:07.020
well look I think both of them did

57:03.270 --> 57:08.730
beautiful final tattoos I think two

57:07.020 --> 57:11.130
completely different styles two

57:08.730 --> 57:14.610
completely different takes both with

57:11.130 --> 57:16.770
seamless smooth application if I look at

57:14.610 --> 57:20.600
both of them I can read

57:16.770 --> 57:23.100
I think legibly that jion's tattoo is

57:20.600 --> 57:24.930
undeniably you pick up what it is right

57:23.100 --> 57:26.580
out of the gate I think Ryan's tattoo

57:24.930 --> 57:28.950
there's a little bit of a hard time

57:26.580 --> 57:30.330
realizing what's actually in the cockpit

57:28.950 --> 57:32.610
that you have those eyes driving

57:30.330 --> 57:34.980
whatever it is so it takes a double-take

57:32.610 --> 57:37.140
know taking away from the tattooing

57:34.980 --> 57:39.470
going all the way down to the layout of

57:37.140 --> 57:42.990
the artwork I think maybe the artwork

57:39.470 --> 57:45.030
Gyan may have squeaked by like that but

57:42.990 --> 57:47.850
you know what Ryan's Ryan's tattoo

57:45.030 --> 57:50.730
debating myself is really strong that

57:47.850 --> 57:57.870
outlines strong the color strong it's a

57:50.730 --> 58:00.210
tough call here yeah I mean for me man

57:57.870 --> 58:02.610
it's both both my team both team members

58:00.210 --> 58:06.240
of mine it's a hard pick two great

58:02.610 --> 58:07.860
tattoos but we have said that we are

58:06.240 --> 58:09.930
throwing a report cards out the window

58:07.860 --> 58:11.970
so what they did all season long does

58:09.930 --> 58:13.200
not matter right now man and we we made

58:11.970 --> 58:15.030
that agreement before we here we were

58:13.200 --> 58:18.840
here tonight we do and it's just these

58:15.030 --> 58:21.690
two tattoos and Geon had eight a

58:18.840 --> 58:23.340
terribly hard challenge and he pulled it

58:21.690 --> 58:24.870
off it's a lot of people are gonna

58:23.340 --> 58:27.810
debate whether it's watercolor or not

58:24.870 --> 58:30.480
I'm gonna stand firm that that is how a

58:27.810 --> 58:33.030
tattooer watercolours not some fine

58:30.480 --> 58:35.340
artist but Ryan's challenge I think was

58:33.030 --> 58:37.980
almost equally as hard because it was

58:35.340 --> 58:40.380
something that's not only stylized but

58:37.980 --> 58:43.110
image wise something she's completely

58:40.380 --> 58:44.820
unfamiliar with and she had to work she

58:43.110 --> 58:47.010
had to work with this artwork looking

58:44.820 --> 58:49.200
back at looking back at hundreds of

58:47.010 --> 58:53.070
tattoos to pick a style when Kelly

58:49.200 --> 58:56.370
assigned watercolor coral reef I thought

58:53.070 --> 58:57.819
immediately there's no way I'm gonna

58:56.370 --> 59:00.489
like that

58:57.819 --> 59:02.799
chance and Jian pulled out something

59:00.489 --> 59:05.170
that actually hits the challenge and

59:02.799 --> 59:07.269
it's pleasurable to look at and it's

59:05.170 --> 59:09.099
discernable well also - I mean I'm

59:07.269 --> 59:11.140
shocked dude you did a great job

59:09.099 --> 59:13.269
Jian has a ton of different textures in

59:11.140 --> 59:15.759
his tattoo you know there's a lot of

59:13.269 --> 59:17.529
fancy tricks in there so you know

59:15.759 --> 59:19.809
there's they're two completely different

59:17.529 --> 59:22.839
styles one's big and bold and one's

59:19.809 --> 59:25.299
really fancy and kind of delicate and

59:22.839 --> 59:29.829
well done but I also can't deny the fact

59:25.299 --> 59:32.499
that Ryan's is super dynamic super

59:29.829 --> 59:34.989
dynamic really stands out when you see

59:32.499 --> 59:37.150
it it pops it does that 90 feels little

59:34.989 --> 59:39.519
thing where it just exudes that color

59:37.150 --> 59:41.170
saturation and that the color play that

59:39.519 --> 59:45.630
real someone outside of their comfort

59:41.170 --> 59:45.630
zone I need a final decision from you

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:04.540
this is the toughest decision I made all

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.880
season long

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:09.790
I hate picking between my two people but

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:13.839
literally the challenge they had to go

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:16.170
through jumping the hoops I I got to go

01:00:13.839 --> 01:00:16.170
to Ryan

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:23.560
all right Chris final decision buddy I

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.420
think for fans of the show and people

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.580
that first look at first glance of what

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:33.870
the two tattoos are people recognize

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:33.870
what Jian did Jian I knew it

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:42.580
first of all let me say all three of you

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:47.290
guys killed it this season I love all

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:50.590
three of you guys Ryan loved the tattoo

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:52.260
Jian knocked it out of the park man but

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:55.960
in terms of just being an overall

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:59.520
dynamic piece that just has that wow

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.520
factor I'm going with Ryan

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:26.249
the judges have decided Briar's

01:01:24.839 --> 01:01:30.210
you do have what it takes to be

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:34.099
inkmaster congratulations thank you good
