04:00.281 --> 04:03.534
America isn't interested
in space exploration anymore.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.703
Maybe we should finally
tell them the big secret--

04:05.787 --> 04:09.123
That all the chimps we sent into space
came back superintelligent.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.919

be telling them that.

04:13.002 --> 04:16.047

04:16.130 --> 04:18.800
We need a fresh angle
to get the public interested.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.301
The public see
our astronauts as

04:20.385 --> 04:22.971
clean-cut,
athletic go-getters.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.013
They hate people like that.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.726

a wide range of emotions.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.522
First I was nervous,
then anxious, then wary,

08:42.605 --> 08:46.692
then apprehensive,
then kind of sleepy,

08:46.776 --> 08:49.654
then worried
and then concerned.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.572
But now I realize
that being a spaceman

08:51.656 --> 08:53.115
