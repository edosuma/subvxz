00:00.493 --> 00:02.795
Previously on AMC's "The Son"...

00:02.797 --> 00:03.896
Aah!

00:09.337 --> 00:11.203
My people are gonna be looking for me.

00:11.205 --> 00:12.938
Those ain't people.

00:12.940 --> 00:14.206
What is this?

00:14.208 --> 00:16.140
The Garcías have oil on their land

00:16.143 --> 00:17.509
and they don't know about it.

00:17.511 --> 00:19.278
There are a few records in your office

00:19.280 --> 00:20.554
we would like to have altered.

00:20.557 --> 00:21.647
What happens next?

00:21.649 --> 00:22.628
- Water!
- Get the water!

00:22.631 --> 00:24.950
Niles believes Pedro sent men to do it.

00:24.952 --> 00:26.952
Pete, don't do this!

00:26.954 --> 00:29.031
You want to stop me, Daddy, shoot me.

00:30.453 --> 00:32.761
This whole town...

00:32.796 --> 00:35.530
Look here. Damn time.

00:35.566 --> 00:37.366
We're under attack, Sheriff.

00:37.401 --> 00:39.401
They're coming after us.

00:39.436 --> 00:40.936
Who are? What are you talkin' about?

00:40.971 --> 00:43.004
Tell the sheriff what you saw.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.706
I was comin' around the corner there,

00:44.742 --> 00:46.441
and I saw a bunch of Pedro García's men

00:46.477 --> 00:47.943
running away from the fire.

00:47.978 --> 00:50.112
I shouted at 'em to
stop, but they took off.

00:50.147 --> 00:52.247
How many men did y see
running away, Louis?

00:52.282 --> 00:54.015
Four, maybe five of 'em.

00:54.051 --> 00:57.185
I shoulda followed 'em, Sheriff.
I know I should've, but..

00:57.188 --> 00:59.516
The fire went up so fast and
I had to tend to that first,

00:59.552 --> 01:02.691
- so I ran for the water truck and...
- You did the right thing.

01:02.726 --> 01:05.093
We're gonna fight back. You hear me?

01:05.129 --> 01:06.695
Look, you don't have to convince me.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.497
I'm just trying to get
all the facts before I go

01:08.499 --> 01:10.632
banging on Pedro García's
door in the middle of the night.

01:10.634 --> 01:13.201
Those are the facts! He just told you!

01:13.237 --> 01:15.570
All right, Niles. All right.

01:19.943 --> 01:21.410
You better stay with the car.

01:21.445 --> 01:23.512
I'll be fine.

01:32.256 --> 01:34.923
Colonel, thank God you're here.

01:34.958 --> 01:37.426
Pedro García burned down my saloon.

01:37.461 --> 01:39.016
We need your help.

01:39.047 --> 01:41.596
I wouldn't be anywhere else.

01:43.300 --> 01:47.102
Everybody, gather 'round.

01:53.210 --> 01:55.477
Most of you have known me a long time.

01:55.512 --> 01:57.078
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

01:57.114 --> 01:59.281
You know I'm a patient man.

01:59.316 --> 02:01.783
I'm a deliberate man.

02:01.819 --> 02:03.652
I'm a fair man.

02:03.687 --> 02:08.490
But tonight, once
again, we were attacked.

02:08.525 --> 02:11.259
Tonight, this war continues against us,

02:11.295 --> 02:14.496
against our women and children,
against our way of life!

02:14.531 --> 02:18.548
And make no mistake... It is a war.

02:22.206 --> 02:24.606
And what have we done to stop it?

02:24.641 --> 02:26.274
Look around at yourselves.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.310
You're all brave men,

02:28.345 --> 02:30.512
but what have you done to stop this?

02:30.547 --> 02:31.947
Not a goddamn thing.

02:31.982 --> 02:33.428
- That's right.
- He's right. Mm-hmm.

02:33.452 --> 02:35.650
Truth is...

02:35.686 --> 02:38.854
I am guilty of hesitation.

02:38.889 --> 02:41.122
Because I believed that this problem

02:41.158 --> 02:44.659
was gonna go away on
its own, but it has not.

02:44.695 --> 02:48.029
Our enemies are not common
bandits or common thieves.

02:48.065 --> 02:51.066
They're not after gold and land.

02:51.101 --> 02:53.902
They're determined to
destroy our way of life,

02:53.937 --> 02:56.705
and their weapon of choice is terror.

02:56.740 --> 03:00.141
So they burn down homes.

03:00.177 --> 03:01.710
They derail trains.

03:01.745 --> 03:04.579
They shoot innocent
people in broad daylight.

03:04.615 --> 03:09.084
And now I'm hearing that they
have been aided and abetted

03:09.119 --> 03:11.887
and supported by one of our own!

03:17.928 --> 03:20.562
You all know the Garcías were there

03:20.597 --> 03:24.165
when our ranch was hit.

03:24.201 --> 03:25.767
People are saying that maybe

03:25.802 --> 03:28.069
they had something to
do with it. Is it true?

03:28.105 --> 03:32.207
I don't know, but I sure
as hell want to find out!

03:32.242 --> 03:34.042
And what are we gonna do?

03:34.077 --> 03:36.411
Do you think we should
continue to do nothing?!

03:36.446 --> 03:38.747
- No.
- Do you want to look your wives in the face

03:38.782 --> 03:40.181
and tell 'em you did nothing?!

03:40.217 --> 03:41.750
- No!
- You want to look your children

03:41.752 --> 03:43.718
in the face and tell
them you did nothing?!

03:43.754 --> 03:46.254
- No!
- No more innocent men being murdered.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.590
No more buildings being
burned in the night.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.859
- No more.
- Do you want justice or not?

03:50.894 --> 03:52.727
- Yes!
- Are you with me?!

03:52.763 --> 03:54.330
- Yes!
- Are you ready to go and

03:54.333 --> 03:55.899
deliver that justice now?!

03:55.933 --> 03:57.365
- Yes!
- Let's get 'em.

03:57.401 --> 03:58.800
Let's get 'em.

04:45.606 --> 04:48.174
Hello! Hey!

04:52.580 --> 04:55.715
Maria! Let me in!

04:57.218 --> 04:58.584
Maria!

04:58.619 --> 05:01.020
Peter.

05:01.055 --> 05:03.055
What's wrong? What are you doing here?

05:03.091 --> 05:05.424
I need to talk to your father.

05:05.460 --> 05:08.894
No. N-No, that's not a good idea.

05:14.202 --> 05:16.368
- What is this?
- Pedro, you need to let me in.

05:16.404 --> 05:17.946
- I don't think so.
- We need to talk.

05:17.949 --> 05:19.071
You're all in danger.

05:33.654 --> 05:36.455
What is it?

05:36.491 --> 05:39.625
My father found oil on your land.

05:42.463 --> 05:45.231
Did you hear what I said?

05:45.266 --> 05:47.900
I heard.

05:47.935 --> 05:49.268
I'm just trying to figure out

05:49.303 --> 05:50.903
why your father sent you to say this.

05:50.938 --> 05:52.281
My father didn't send me.

05:52.284 --> 05:54.457
He did everything he could
to stop me from coming.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.728
Why would you do this for me?

05:59.580 --> 06:01.547
I think you know why.

06:01.582 --> 06:03.749
Maria. Maria.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.114

_

07:11.641 --> 07:14.768
_

07:16.587 --> 07:18.672
Why is your father doing this, Pete?

07:18.707 --> 07:20.006
What does he want?

07:21.195 --> 07:23.329
There's oil on your land.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.200
- Get out of my house!
- Mama.

07:28.236 --> 07:29.668
We should all go.

07:30.641 --> 07:32.494
_

07:32.497 --> 07:34.290
_

07:35.212 --> 07:37.082
_

07:37.123 --> 07:38.581
_

07:38.605 --> 07:41.127
_

07:41.127 --> 07:43.581
_

07:43.652 --> 07:45.518
My father doesn't start
fights he can't win.

07:45.589 --> 07:47.008
_

07:47.133 --> 07:52.305
_

07:59.967 --> 08:01.667
Pete.

08:01.702 --> 08:03.335
You have to help me
convince your father.

08:03.371 --> 08:05.404
Convince him of what exactly?

08:05.439 --> 08:06.832
Convince him to leave.

08:06.863 --> 08:09.775
I don't know what to believe, Pete.

08:09.810 --> 08:11.777
Is your father doing this?

08:11.812 --> 08:14.613
Or are you? Or is it both of you?

08:14.649 --> 08:16.849
At this point, it's everyone in town.

08:16.884 --> 08:18.550
- You have to go.
- No. Why?

08:18.586 --> 08:20.386
No one wants you here.
Do you understand that?

08:20.421 --> 08:22.178
They've all been waiting for an excuse.

08:22.181 --> 08:23.389
My father gave it to them.

08:23.424 --> 08:26.101
So we just run over the border
in the middle of the night?

08:26.156 --> 08:26.959
Yes.

08:26.994 --> 08:29.228
This is the United States.

08:29.263 --> 08:30.262
There are laws here.

08:30.298 --> 08:32.097
Not right now there aren't.

08:32.133 --> 08:36.235
We're not running, Pete.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.535
You're gonna protect us.

08:37.571 --> 08:40.606
You are going to stop him.

08:43.144 --> 08:45.811
_

09:10.371 --> 09:12.237
I can't believe you're back.

09:12.273 --> 09:13.639
Barely made it.

09:13.674 --> 09:16.575
Everyone thought you
went back to the whites.

09:16.610 --> 09:19.040
Everyone?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.880
None of that matters.

09:20.892 --> 09:22.581
You're here now. We
have to move quickly.

09:22.616 --> 09:23.949
Come on. Help. Let's go.

09:23.985 --> 09:26.151
Go where?

09:26.187 --> 09:28.587
You came back to get me.

09:28.622 --> 09:30.289
Didn't you?

09:32.660 --> 09:35.594
I don't understand.

09:35.629 --> 09:37.796
Why are you here? You could've run.

09:41.502 --> 09:43.302
I belong here.

10:16.070 --> 10:17.870
Tiehteti?

10:23.680 --> 10:25.277
_

10:29.646 --> 10:31.840
_

10:33.454 --> 10:36.188
What happened? Where were you?

10:36.223 --> 10:37.990
Where's Prairie Flower?

10:50.237 --> 10:51.937
- Stay back.
- What'd you do?

10:51.972 --> 10:54.406
What did I do? You disappeared.

10:54.442 --> 10:56.267
So you just went and got
married, just like that?

10:56.269 --> 10:57.635
I had no choice.

10:58.446 --> 11:01.780
This is our way. You know this.

11:05.052 --> 11:07.586
You have to go away, Eli.

11:07.621 --> 11:08.954
I can't see you anymore.

11:08.956 --> 11:10.550
- Tiehteti.
- Where is he?

11:10.574 --> 11:13.025
Tiehteti. Come on.

11:13.060 --> 11:15.694
Come with me.

11:18.941 --> 11:21.600
_

11:21.852 --> 11:23.485
_

11:23.488 --> 11:24.726
_

11:24.726 --> 11:27.937
_

11:28.118 --> 11:31.232
_

11:31.232 --> 11:34.472
_

11:35.904 --> 11:39.699
_

11:39.699 --> 11:41.159
_

11:48.416 --> 11:53.254
_

11:55.840 --> 11:59.969
_

12:00.702 --> 12:04.163
_

12:11.163 --> 12:13.116
_

12:13.186 --> 12:16.986
_

12:19.081 --> 12:20.323
_

12:20.323 --> 12:22.533
_

12:23.576 --> 12:25.828
_

12:26.996 --> 12:29.540
_

12:29.999 --> 12:31.626
_

12:37.298 --> 12:41.344
_

12:43.012 --> 12:45.139
_

12:52.493 --> 12:54.159
Four horses?

12:54.195 --> 12:56.662
He pushes me off a cliff,
and you get four horses?

12:56.697 --> 12:59.231
Four horses is a lot.

12:59.266 --> 13:01.967
- I could have died.
- But you didn't.

13:02.002 --> 13:05.204
And now I have four more horses.

13:05.239 --> 13:07.906
You can have two of them.

13:07.942 --> 13:10.042
It's not right. The
punishment should be bigger.

13:10.077 --> 13:12.311
I don't think he was very
happy about it, either.

13:12.346 --> 13:15.180
He'll have to borrow the horses
from Prairie Flower's father.

13:15.216 --> 13:17.076
It's not about the horses.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.685
There are other girls. We'll
find you a different one.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.887
It doesn't work like that.

13:23.624 --> 13:24.890
I love her.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.427
And she's with someone else now.

13:35.194 --> 13:37.661
Then I'll kill him.

13:38.546 --> 13:40.570
_

13:43.611 --> 13:46.178
Comanche cannot hurt another Comanche.

13:46.213 --> 13:47.946
You're free, Tiehteti.

13:47.982 --> 13:50.215
If you want to go back to the whites,

13:50.251 --> 13:53.218
no one can stop you.

13:53.254 --> 13:55.287
But if you want to be one of us,

13:55.322 --> 13:58.257
then you'll live by our rules.

13:58.292 --> 13:59.958
Understand?

14:05.466 --> 14:06.765
Clean this up.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.533
Tomorrow, we go hunting.

14:10.904 --> 14:13.105
- This is beautiful.
- Mm.

14:13.140 --> 14:16.241
Try not to shoot yourself.

15:15.818 --> 15:17.618
- Did you cut the phone lines?
- Yes, sir.

15:17.653 --> 15:19.253
Get that dynamite ready!

15:19.288 --> 15:21.355
Once we lay down enough
fire to pin 'em down,

15:21.390 --> 15:22.756
we'll blow the door.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.424
- You ready?
- Ready.

15:27.162 --> 15:30.063
You got the shotgun?

16:30.659 --> 16:32.626
Just surrender yourself, Pedro!

16:34.296 --> 16:35.696
I will not.

16:42.304 --> 16:44.471
How many of you did I personally welcome

16:44.506 --> 16:45.972
when you came to this town?

16:46.008 --> 16:50.277
How many have dined here at my house

16:50.312 --> 16:52.012
with my family?

16:52.047 --> 16:54.348
And now here you are.

16:54.383 --> 16:56.283
To kill me.

16:56.318 --> 16:57.784
To take my land.

16:57.820 --> 17:01.655
You turned my bar
into a goddamn bonfire!

17:01.690 --> 17:04.358
No.

17:04.393 --> 17:07.461
I would never destroy
property in this town.

17:07.496 --> 17:09.363
It is my home.

17:09.397 --> 17:12.531
My family has lived
here for two centuries.

17:12.568 --> 17:16.236
How long have you lived
here, Niles Gilbert?

17:18.272 --> 17:21.340
How 'bout you, Sheriff?

17:21.377 --> 17:25.912
Minister Frank, how long
have you lived in this town?

17:28.016 --> 17:32.152
To me, you are all intruders.

17:32.187 --> 17:34.321
Carpetbaggers.

17:34.356 --> 17:35.555
Canallas.

17:38.427 --> 17:42.763
And you, Eli, you, now I see my mistake.

17:42.798 --> 17:44.398
You will never have enough.

17:44.433 --> 17:48.735
Enough land, enough money.

17:48.771 --> 17:51.238
I should have let you
die with all your family.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.878
- Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire.

17:57.913 --> 17:59.880
Pete.

18:01.917 --> 18:03.417
Get away from there.

18:03.452 --> 18:05.419
I don't know what my father told you,

18:05.454 --> 18:09.055
but you're all being lied to.

18:09.091 --> 18:11.358
Pedro didn't burn down that bar.

18:11.393 --> 18:13.026
Come on, Pete.

18:13.061 --> 18:15.095
He's using all of you to get this land.

18:15.130 --> 18:17.397
- Please stop.
- My family is bankrupt.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.168
- We're about to lose the ranch.
- I don't wanna say this.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.368
Not in front of all these
people who care about you.

18:21.403 --> 18:23.804
He paid somebody to burn down that bar.

18:25.574 --> 18:27.207
Easy, son.

18:27.242 --> 18:31.211
Pete, I know you've been
going through a hard time.

18:31.246 --> 18:34.247
There are people here who can help you.

18:34.283 --> 18:37.451
We can find medicines
for your troubled mind.

18:37.486 --> 18:41.822
Just... come back to your friends.

18:41.857 --> 18:45.642
There's oil on Pedro's land.

18:45.673 --> 18:47.394
My father wants it.

18:47.429 --> 18:49.729
He's willing to do whatever it takes.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.668
That's a lie, Pete.

18:54.703 --> 18:58.472
Pedro's been supporting the
sediciosos for years.

18:58.507 --> 19:00.941
But that wasn't enough, I guess.

19:00.976 --> 19:03.176
Today...

19:03.212 --> 19:07.814
I lost my place of business!

19:07.850 --> 19:10.450
But be rest assured,

19:10.486 --> 19:12.980
tomorrow, it will be one of you.

19:13.011 --> 19:17.624
Your homes, your families.

19:17.659 --> 19:19.993
Unless we take action now.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.128
Hold it together.

19:35.577 --> 19:38.178
You see how the wind's blowing.

19:44.353 --> 19:46.152
Come with me, son.

19:51.793 --> 19:52.993
Aah!

20:05.941 --> 20:07.674
Pete!

20:18.186 --> 20:19.519
Pete! Pete!

20:19.555 --> 20:21.021
Stop shooting!

20:21.056 --> 20:23.590
Stop shooting now!

20:32.568 --> 20:34.534
Down, down.

20:36.004 --> 20:38.672
Aah!

20:38.707 --> 20:39.839
Mi amor.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.908
Aah!

20:45.666 --> 20:46.746
Aah!

20:46.782 --> 20:48.548
Ugh!

20:48.584 --> 20:49.665
_

20:49.665 --> 20:50.900
_

20:50.958 --> 20:52.209
_

20:52.418 --> 20:53.461
_

20:53.464 --> 20:54.420
_

21:02.698 --> 21:04.197
_

21:05.631 --> 21:06.932
_

21:07.099 --> 21:08.561
_

21:23.385 --> 21:25.518
_

21:29.157 --> 21:30.890
Ignacio!

21:42.804 --> 21:44.304
No!

22:20.342 --> 22:24.444
Get in there! Get that door open now!

22:24.479 --> 22:25.812
Give 'em cover.

22:42.864 --> 22:44.097
Ugh!

22:47.536 --> 22:49.169
Ugh!

22:52.874 --> 22:54.307
Get those guns up!

22:54.342 --> 22:56.376
Get those goddamn guns up!

22:58.814 --> 23:00.814
That's good. Press 'em down.

23:04.319 --> 23:06.124
Roof's clear.

23:06.156 --> 23:08.621
Good man, Neptune.

23:08.657 --> 23:10.523
Now retrieve that damn dynamite.

23:15.363 --> 23:17.397
Light it up.

23:25.707 --> 23:26.997
Get back, boys. Get back.

23:35.517 --> 23:37.333
Come on. Come on.

23:41.573 --> 23:43.556
Come on.

23:43.592 --> 23:46.943
Aah.

23:46.978 --> 23:49.879
Is Pete alive? Is Pete alive?

23:49.915 --> 23:52.382
I don't know. Let's get you out of here.

23:54.553 --> 23:56.086
It's all right.

24:39.331 --> 24:41.731
You're mad at me?

24:41.766 --> 24:43.733
Yeah.

24:43.768 --> 24:45.969
I don't like it.

24:46.004 --> 24:48.972
I don't really care.

24:49.007 --> 24:52.008
She your first woman?

24:52.043 --> 24:54.744
Eh, you're young. There'll be others.

24:54.779 --> 24:56.913
Hyah! Hyah!

24:59.050 --> 25:00.517
Those are goddamn rangers.

25:00.552 --> 25:03.419
Yeah.

25:17.235 --> 25:18.234
Ugh!

25:20.800 --> 25:21.738
Ugh.

25:25.744 --> 25:27.143
Ugh!

25:27.179 --> 25:28.244
Aah!

25:28.880 --> 25:29.812
Ugh!

25:33.685 --> 25:36.219
Get the horses. Find the others.

25:59.511 --> 26:00.710
Don't do that!

26:00.745 --> 26:01.678
Aah!

26:01.713 --> 26:03.346
Ooh.

26:03.381 --> 26:04.581
Aah!

26:05.750 --> 26:07.317
Aah!

26:09.221 --> 26:12.355
I bet that smarts, huh?

26:13.858 --> 26:15.058
Aah!

26:19.231 --> 26:21.331
You gonna be my first Injun.

26:25.303 --> 26:28.253
_

26:28.253 --> 26:30.756
_

26:32.944 --> 26:36.946
You know, I hear tell...

26:36.982 --> 26:39.215
you can't get into heaven
if someone takes your scalp.

26:44.623 --> 26:47.223
Come here. That long black hair a'yours

26:47.259 --> 26:49.459
is gonna look real sweet
hangin' from my belt.

26:49.494 --> 26:51.194
Hold still, ya...

26:52.831 --> 26:54.264
Ugh.

27:07.612 --> 27:09.912
_

27:09.948 --> 27:12.615
_

27:13.004 --> 27:14.091
_

27:17.427 --> 27:21.890
_

27:21.890 --> 27:25.594
_

27:51.156 --> 27:52.689
Why'd you come here?

27:52.724 --> 27:54.757
Why are you after us?

27:54.793 --> 27:56.926
Y-You're on our land.

27:58.363 --> 28:02.398
If you go somewhere else,
we'd leave you alone.

28:27.525 --> 28:29.959
_

29:32.696 --> 29:34.595
Maria?

29:49.379 --> 29:50.912
Shh.

29:52.315 --> 29:53.681
Come on.

29:58.955 --> 30:00.355
Come on.

30:08.231 --> 30:11.032
Shh. Shh. Shh.

30:11.067 --> 30:13.000
We got to leave right now, okay?

30:13.036 --> 30:14.535
Mm-hmm.

30:24.013 --> 30:27.215
Maria, we got to move quick.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.283
We got to move quick. Come on.

31:16.933 --> 31:18.900
Louis.

31:18.935 --> 31:22.036
Hey, Louis.

31:22.071 --> 31:24.071
How you holding up there, buddy?

31:24.107 --> 31:26.374
You didn't say it was
gonna be like this.

31:26.409 --> 31:28.276
What'd you think it was gonna be like?

31:30.647 --> 31:32.547
We're all going to hell.

31:34.451 --> 31:36.451
Well...

31:36.486 --> 31:38.719
maybe u just don't have
the stomach for this.

32:06.082 --> 32:07.482
Come on.

32:41.951 --> 32:44.352
So, it seems Pedro had been sympathetic

32:44.387 --> 32:49.090
to the sediciosos longer
than any of us had realized.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.591
He burned down Niles' bar,

32:50.627 --> 32:52.527
which could have
destroyed the whole town.

32:52.562 --> 32:54.529
We're lucky it didn't.

32:54.564 --> 32:57.932
And after that, everyone in
town was so furious and scared,

32:57.967 --> 33:00.804
they all rode out to the García ranch.

33:00.828 --> 33:02.703
And the Colonel tried to talk Pedro

33:02.739 --> 33:04.872
into surrendering peacefully, but...

33:04.908 --> 33:07.308
his men just opened fire.

33:07.343 --> 33:09.944
That doesn't make any sense.

33:09.979 --> 33:12.614
Why would they start shooting
with the family inside?

33:12.645 --> 33:14.482
I don't know what to tell you.

33:14.517 --> 33:15.903
Maybe he felt cornered.

33:17.921 --> 33:20.955
By the mob of people with
torches surrounding their house?

33:20.990 --> 33:22.690
Hard to believe.

33:22.725 --> 33:24.492
There weren't any torches.

33:24.527 --> 33:26.527
How do you know? You weren't even there.

33:26.563 --> 33:28.162
A whole lot of people died.

33:28.197 --> 33:30.331
Everyone in town's wearing
black. It's horrible.

33:30.366 --> 33:32.833
So wh-where was Daddy in all this?

33:32.869 --> 33:35.636
He was trying to reason with Pedro.

33:35.672 --> 33:37.038
Stop anyone from getting hurt.

33:38.592 --> 33:41.126
Unfortunately, it didn't work out.

33:43.513 --> 33:45.413
So where is he now?

33:45.448 --> 33:46.914
Is he dead?

33:46.950 --> 33:49.383
No, if he was, we would
have found him by now.

33:49.419 --> 33:53.020
Well, then where is he? Where'd he go?

33:55.191 --> 33:57.992
He left us.

33:58.027 --> 33:59.493
So it doesn't matter.

33:59.529 --> 34:03.164
Of course it matters.
What's wrong with you?

34:03.199 --> 34:05.032
Shut your mouth.

34:08.871 --> 34:12.773
We have every Pinkerton in
the state looking for him.

34:12.809 --> 34:15.409
I promise you all,

34:15.445 --> 34:18.245
I'll do everything in
my power to find him.

34:28.491 --> 34:31.958
Tell me the truth.

34:31.995 --> 34:34.094
What did you do to him?

34:34.130 --> 34:36.263
Where is he really?

34:36.299 --> 34:38.264
We don't know.

34:38.301 --> 34:40.568
How could you possibly not know?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.539
I'm sorry, Sally.

34:45.574 --> 34:47.775
Don't apologize.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.578
Tell me something that isn't bullshit!

34:50.612 --> 34:54.581
I know you're understandably upset.

34:58.521 --> 35:01.480
What have you done to our family, Eli?

35:04.494 --> 35:06.293
I need to rest.

35:19.175 --> 35:21.976
Pete hasn't been well for a long time.

35:22.011 --> 35:23.411
It's everything you been feeling,

35:23.446 --> 35:25.846
everything you been noticing about him.

35:25.882 --> 35:28.816
And this was the, uh...

35:28.851 --> 35:31.152
the last straw, I guess.

35:31.187 --> 35:33.354
Something broke.

35:33.389 --> 35:36.791
All right, you're
telling me how Pete is,

35:36.826 --> 35:39.226
but not where he is.

35:58.715 --> 36:00.514
The last time I saw Pete,

36:00.550 --> 36:03.050
he was heading to the
border with Maria García.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.633
- Did you know about them?
- No.

36:22.371 --> 36:26.240
He is not right in the head, Sally.

36:26.275 --> 36:28.743
Anyone who would leave you...

36:30.847 --> 36:32.813
Don't.

39:18.580 --> 39:21.181
In the matter of the agricultural land

39:21.216 --> 39:24.451
formerly owned by Pedro García,

39:24.486 --> 39:26.920
including the house, outbuildings,

39:26.955 --> 39:32.559
and 125,000 undeveloped acres.

39:32.594 --> 39:35.295
The original deed is Spanish.

39:35.330 --> 39:42.269
Paid the last transfer...
April 17, 1750.

39:42.304 --> 39:45.639
$563.64

39:45.674 --> 39:49.409
are due Dimmit County in back taxes.

39:49.444 --> 39:55.048
I will begin the bidding at $563.64.

39:55.083 --> 39:56.783
Are there any bidders here?

40:00.355 --> 40:02.956
Are there any other bidders here?

40:04.493 --> 40:06.927
Going once.

40:06.962 --> 40:10.063
Going twice.

40:10.098 --> 40:11.765
Sold to the McCulloughs.

41:44.523 --> 41:47.357
_

41:49.625 --> 41:51.884
_

41:52.766 --> 41:54.701
_

41:58.640 --> 42:02.275
When will they stop coming?

42:02.310 --> 42:04.611
They won't.
