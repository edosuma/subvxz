- They hauled meat, mostly.

anything further to share.

07:01.709 --> 07:05.044

hotel project has been destroyed

07:05.077 --> 07:07.349

07:14.955 --> 07:17.051
It's not about the money, Alex.

07:17.092 --> 07:20.256
It's about your ability to lead.

07:21.951 --> 07:23.053
Hmm.

07:24.558 --> 07:26.461
I'd have a lot more
faith in his intentions

- all the stuff here comes up and...
- Oh, I know you're not about to blame me

- for your police record.
- No, no, no, no, of course not.

I could come back here

- Breece Connors, Siobhan's ex-husband.

- So what was that about?
- A job he's after.

He wants me to lift
the restraining order.

10:40.034 --> 10:42.568
Hope you told him to get lost.
You told him "no", right?

the Thunder Man.

52:54.985 --> 52:58.688
Go home.
I'll clean this up.

52:58.721 --> 53:01.625
- He'll tell 'em it was me.
- Yeah, I'll have a talk with him.

53:01.658 --> 53:03.593
He won't stick around.

53:09.863 --> 53:12.334
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

53:16.042 --> 53:17.675
Go home.

53:26.146 --> 53:28.553
You know, for the last four years,

53:28.587 --> 53:31.090
there wasn't a day 
that I didn't imagine

53:31.123 --> 53:33.426
some version of this playing out.

53:36.893 --> 53:38.900
<i>How does it feel?</i>

53:41.300 --> 53:43.981
Better than I imagined.

53:46.036 --> 53:47.676
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:50.683 --> 53:53.917
- Thanks, boss.
- Don't mention it.

54:24.609 --> 54:27.610

55:11.015 --> 55:12.655
Thanks.

55:39.897 --> 55:42.600
