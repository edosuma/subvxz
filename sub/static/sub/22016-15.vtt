WEBVTT

00:01.984 --> 00:03.868
Daddy.
What are you doing up?

00:03.870 --> 00:05.470
I can't sleep.

00:05.521 --> 00:07.823
Wait. You eat
while I'm in bed?

00:07.890 --> 00:09.941
Is there a meal
I don't know about?

00:10.008 --> 00:10.892
A couple.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.394
But you need to
hit the hay, buddy.

00:12.461 --> 00:16.815
I need you sawin' logs
until 0700.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.400
I don't know what
any of that means.

00:19.468 --> 00:22.471
Gloria and I are going through
a romantic dry spell.

00:22.538 --> 00:24.655
Luckily, she's out tonight
with her friend, Rebecca,

00:24.723 --> 00:26.374
who is married to a jackass.

00:26.442 --> 00:29.978
Gloria always comes home
ready to show
her appreciation.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.012
Suddenly, me going to bed
with socks on

00:32.080 --> 00:34.615
is not such a deal-breaker.

00:34.683 --> 00:36.834
Aw, geez.

00:36.902 --> 00:39.438
I'm home!
Hey, Jay.

00:39.505 --> 00:40.721
How's Rebecca?

00:40.789 --> 00:42.607
She's never
been better.

00:42.674 --> 00:44.025
So, she left the husband,
like, a month ago,

00:44.093 --> 00:48.630
and it's like a weight
has been
lifted off her shoulders.

00:48.698 --> 00:49.614
Speaking of shoulders,

00:49.782 --> 00:51.149
are you ready for
one of my famous massages?

00:51.217 --> 00:52.233
No, I'm good.

00:53.753 --> 00:54.502
It's her.

00:54.570 --> 00:55.687
Hello?

00:55.755 --> 00:58.656
The waiter?

00:58.724 --> 01:01.392
I knew he was
flirting with you!

01:01.460 --> 01:04.111
Don't forget about
that clod she married!

01:04.180 --> 01:06.765
You got one of
the good guys!

01:06.832 --> 01:10.068
And he didn't have to
write down our order,

01:10.136 --> 01:12.353
so you know that he won't
forget your birthday.

01:12.421 --> 01:15.056
Ay!

01:16.458 --> 01:18.860
Joe leaves all his toys
on the floor.

01:18.928 --> 01:21.629
I tell him to pick them up,
but he doesn't listen.

01:21.697 --> 01:25.733
I'm telling you,
it's a disaster
in the bedroom.

01:25.801 --> 01:27.418
I don't know
what to do.

01:27.486 --> 01:30.655
It's like he can't remember
where things go.

01:30.723 --> 01:36.444
Eventually, I get
so frustrated that
I take care of it myself.

01:36.512 --> 01:38.246
Spanking?

01:38.314 --> 01:40.165
Well, yeah, I guess
we could try that.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.150
Actually, now that
you mention it,

01:42.218 --> 01:45.020
Javier and I tried it
a long time ago.

01:45.087 --> 01:47.422
It was a game-changer.

01:48.156 --> 01:50.892
Ay. Rebecca
is doing so well.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.460
Sounds like
she's having fun.

01:52.528 --> 01:55.246
Navy used to
make us watch films
about girls like that.

01:55.314 --> 01:58.783
Well, her husband never really
gave her what she needed.

01:58.851 --> 02:00.268
Did she tell him?

02:00.336 --> 02:03.255
No. But sometimes it's more
exciting to be with someone

02:03.322 --> 02:07.125
that already knows
what you want
without you telling them.

02:07.243 --> 02:08.376
Got it.

02:08.443 --> 02:09.827
Ay! Hey!

02:09.895 --> 02:11.279
Wh-What the hell
was that?!

02:11.347 --> 02:12.447
Nothing!
You know what?

02:12.515 --> 02:15.015
I think I forgot
to lock the front door.

02:28.247 --> 02:30.231
There he is.
Oh, now, don't get mad.

02:30.299 --> 02:32.249
I know I said I was only
getting tulips for the party,

02:32.384 --> 02:34.368
but I splurged
and I got orchids.

02:34.436 --> 02:36.153
Hey, I wanted the party
to be special, too.

02:36.221 --> 02:37.321
Okay.
And in my defense,
I didn't know

02:37.389 --> 02:38.906
about the orchids.

02:38.974 --> 02:40.241
I got a piano.

02:40.309 --> 02:42.076
Really? Where?

02:42.144 --> 02:43.762
I recently got
a pretty fancy job

02:43.812 --> 02:46.380
working for billionaire
Michael Quinly.

02:46.448 --> 02:47.949
It's kind of a big deal.
It is a big deal.

02:48.017 --> 02:49.918
Now, admittedly,
throwing a party

02:49.986 --> 02:51.869
to celebrate your own
reversal of fortune

02:51.937 --> 02:53.287
could be seen as braggy.

02:53.355 --> 02:55.457
Sort of a rags-to-bitches
story, if you will.

02:55.524 --> 02:57.125
Then again,
for a while now,

02:57.210 --> 02:59.460
when I've been telling my
friends that I was struggling,

02:59.545 --> 03:01.379
they'd give me
"that look"--

03:01.447 --> 03:02.931
the one that's
mostly sympathetic

03:02.999 --> 03:06.134
with just a touch of
enjoying my pain.

03:06.201 --> 03:08.803
So, today,
I get the other look--

03:08.871 --> 03:11.205
the one that's mostly
"I'm so happy for you"

03:11.273 --> 03:14.108
with just a hint of
"I am wracked with jealousy."

03:16.178 --> 03:17.845
It'll be good to see
the old gang again.

03:17.913 --> 03:19.497
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

03:22.284 --> 03:23.634
Hey, you.

03:23.702 --> 03:26.087
What's going on?
You, uh-- you texting a boy?

03:26.155 --> 03:27.555
Just figuring out
my summer plans.

03:27.622 --> 03:28.873
I remember the summer
of my junior year.

03:28.940 --> 03:32.126
I followed N.W.A. on tour--
Nebraskans With Accordions.

03:32.194 --> 03:35.129
This was before Polka Pete was
brutally murdered, of course.

03:35.197 --> 03:36.381
Yeah, this is
a little different.

03:36.448 --> 03:37.832
I'm actually up for
an internship

03:37.900 --> 03:39.751
researching the minimal
supersymmetric standard model

03:39.819 --> 03:40.885
at M.I.T.

03:40.952 --> 03:43.738
Cool. Beantown.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.807
I don't know why
I'm getting all girly
and excited about it.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.475
It's not like I'm
gonna get it anyways.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.877
What's with the quitter talk?
If you want my advice--

03:49.945 --> 03:50.828
No, I don't,
but thanks.

03:50.896 --> 03:52.763
What is all this junk?

03:52.831 --> 03:54.549
Fruit Roll-Ups, chips,
chocolate milk? Ugh.

03:54.616 --> 03:57.001
Th-There's nothing
in the fridge.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.471
I'm packing you a lunch.

03:59.538 --> 04:01.406
I've always heard
there comes a time in life

04:01.473 --> 04:04.209
when the kid starts
parenting the parents.

04:04.226 --> 04:05.926
I thought it would be
when I was in my 40s.

04:06.011 --> 04:07.829
But I'm pretty mature
for my age,

04:07.896 --> 04:10.265
and my dad claps
when he gets waffle fries.

04:10.332 --> 04:11.383
What are you even
still doing home?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.268
Don't you usually open
your magic shop by now?

04:13.335 --> 04:15.353
Yeah. I'm just going in
a little late.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.720
Doesn't sound good
for business.

04:16.788 --> 04:18.505
And I saw you sneak those
carrots out of your lunch.

04:18.572 --> 04:21.459
I'm trying to avoid one of
the other shop owners.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.043
Kind of an intimidating
character.

04:23.111 --> 04:25.062
It started with a dispute
over a parking space

04:25.130 --> 04:26.531
and escalated
from there.

04:26.598 --> 04:29.667
Hey... we don't avoid bullies
in this family.

04:29.735 --> 04:31.603
We stand up to them.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.354
Off you go.

04:33.422 --> 04:35.456
I don't think you realize what
kind of person I'm up against.

04:35.524 --> 04:36.941
Yesterday, all my
dribble glasses

04:37.009 --> 04:38.543
were replaced
with real ones.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.095
It was humiliating.

04:40.162 --> 04:42.781
So, Long', we have a lot
to catch up on.

04:42.848 --> 04:44.632
What's up?
Not my weight.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.568
The Tom Brady diet changed
the way I see the world.

04:47.636 --> 04:50.771
Food, not food,
super-food, poison.

04:50.839 --> 04:52.907
Oh, well, okay,
that covers you.

04:52.975 --> 04:54.625
So...
I was going to ask about you,

04:54.693 --> 04:56.293
but you know I'm always
nervous about the answer.

04:56.361 --> 04:57.778
Well, you know what?
Let's roll the dice.

04:57.846 --> 04:59.731
So, it turns out that I--
Hey, Mitch.

04:59.798 --> 05:02.283
Hi. Where's Cam? Hey.
Oh.

05:02.350 --> 05:04.035
Claire, what a surprise.

05:04.102 --> 05:04.919
What are you
talking about?

05:04.987 --> 05:06.270
You asked me to bring over
the piano music.

05:06.321 --> 05:07.121
"Party-time Favorites"?

05:07.189 --> 05:08.756
Oh, my gosh,
how apropos.

05:08.824 --> 05:11.676
I'll just set these on our new
piano...
Mm.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.328
...that I know
how to play.

05:13.395 --> 05:15.246
Great party, boys.

05:15.313 --> 05:17.098
We need to talk about
the piano in the room.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.350
Uh, well, yes, so, okay, okay.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.052
So, Cam has always
wanted one,

05:21.120 --> 05:23.488
and, frankly, it has been
out of our price range

05:23.555 --> 05:25.106
until this week.

05:25.174 --> 05:27.024
Fun story.
It turns out that I--

05:27.092 --> 05:28.809
Hi.
I'm being rude.

05:28.894 --> 05:30.278
Sam Turnbull.

05:30.346 --> 05:31.846
Oh!
Claire Dunphy.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.432
Hi. You are the editor
of <i> L.A. Woman</i> magazine,
right?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.467
I believe it's pronounced...
"La Woman."

05:36.535 --> 05:38.136
It isn't.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.187
It's funny because your office
called my business last week.

05:40.255 --> 05:43.007
Apparently,
I'm on some short list

05:43.075 --> 05:44.859
for the Women in Business
issue.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.694
Closets, right?
Yeah.

05:46.762 --> 05:47.962
I shattered
the glass ceiling--

05:48.047 --> 05:51.332
and, ironically, we have
a new glass-ceiling closet.

05:51.399 --> 05:53.284
You can see if it's raining
when you're getting dressed.

05:53.335 --> 05:55.186
Gonna save
a lot of suede.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.038
Well, it's, um, pretty
competitive this year.

05:57.105 --> 05:58.506
Oh.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.507
Anyway, I'm meeting
someone on the
other side of the piano.

06:00.575 --> 06:02.493
I should leave now.

06:02.594 --> 06:03.861
Oh.

06:03.929 --> 06:07.498
I don't even care about
his stupid magazine,

06:07.566 --> 06:08.850
but to be dismissed
like that?

06:08.918 --> 06:12.720
Hey, everyone, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.

06:12.787 --> 06:14.505
We never get to
see each other anymore,

06:14.573 --> 06:16.124
what with our busy lives.

06:16.192 --> 06:19.076
And Jotham's ambient music
compositions

06:19.144 --> 06:21.862
and, uh, Deepak's
guerrilla gardening

06:21.930 --> 06:25.650
and, uh, well,
me and my big new job

06:25.718 --> 06:27.502
working for
Michael Quinly.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.019
Yeah.

06:29.087 --> 06:30.871
The rich guy whose name
is on all those museums?

06:30.939 --> 06:33.591
And hospitals, yeah.
So, to all of us!

06:33.659 --> 06:36.443
Ah, congratulations.

06:36.511 --> 06:38.612
That's-that's really great.
We're all--

06:38.680 --> 06:39.714
We're all so happy
for you.

06:39.781 --> 06:41.015
Thank you.
Thank you.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.083
Hey, hey.
Hi.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.334
You saw the look, right?
Yeah.

06:43.401 --> 06:47.605
Pure love and support with
just a hint of rancid envy.

06:47.672 --> 06:49.156
A word.

06:49.224 --> 06:50.791
But I'm basking.
Um, Cam.

06:50.859 --> 06:52.526
So, while you were talking,
I got online,

06:52.645 --> 06:56.247
and... your new boss
was caught embezzling.

06:56.314 --> 06:57.682
Your company
is crumbling.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.585
No! No! This-this can't be
happening to me again.

07:00.653 --> 07:02.520
You know what?
You'll find something else.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.105
Oh, my-- Cam,
I literally just bragged

07:04.173 --> 07:05.723
about a job
that doesn't exist.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.641
Okay, okay.
They cannot know,

07:07.709 --> 07:09.977
or else this will turn into
an actual pity party.

07:10.045 --> 07:11.296
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I-I got this.

07:11.363 --> 07:12.679
Hi, everyone.

07:12.747 --> 07:15.700
So, we are about to get
to know one another
on a deeper,

07:15.768 --> 07:17.402
more personal level.

07:17.419 --> 07:19.403
I think you all know
what the bowl is for.

07:19.471 --> 07:23.307
Hey, no.
Not your keys, Jotham.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.625
Your phones!

07:24.692 --> 07:27.645
We are about to rediscover the
long-lost art of conversation.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.963
What if
the sitter calls?

07:29.031 --> 07:31.498
Your dog will be fine.
Phones, gentlemen, phones.

07:35.270 --> 07:36.637
You're working
on a Saturday?

07:36.704 --> 07:38.572
I've been dealing with
a little problem.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.025
In moments like this,
there's only one place I turn.

07:41.092 --> 07:43.461
Well, I am flattered,
Dad.

07:43.529 --> 07:44.879
Right.

07:44.946 --> 07:47.949
Hey, but, you know,
since you're here...

07:48.016 --> 07:50.484
Uh, it's a
difficult subject.

07:50.552 --> 07:51.585
Gloria and I...

07:51.653 --> 07:53.237
Mm-hmm.

07:53.305 --> 07:54.939
...having an issue
in the bedroom.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.307
Okay.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.542
There's been a drop-off

07:57.609 --> 07:58.593
of pace and intensity.
Mm-hmm.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.795
I get the impression
she's looking for,

08:00.863 --> 08:02.012
maybe, a little more variety.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.264
Mm.
But you can't blame her.

08:03.331 --> 08:04.849
I've been using the same moves
since the '70s.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.885
I may as well be doing
"The Hustle" in there.

08:06.952 --> 08:08.635
I'm just gonna
wet my whistle.

08:08.670 --> 08:10.738
I heard her tell
her friend last night

08:10.806 --> 08:12.891
about wanting
to be spanked.

08:12.958 --> 08:16.460
And later, the opportunity
presented itself, and...

08:16.528 --> 08:17.745
No, you didn't.
You didn't.

08:17.812 --> 08:19.513
Three times.
Oh, God. Why three times, Dad?

08:19.581 --> 08:21.316
I don't know. Maybe all those
years of ping-pong

08:21.383 --> 08:22.750
in the warehouse.

08:22.817 --> 08:24.302
I've got very agile wrists.
Mm.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.470
But I don't know how
I come back from this one.

08:26.538 --> 08:29.524
Well, uh, Dad,
when you, um--

08:29.591 --> 08:31.308
When you did what
you did to Gloria,

08:31.376 --> 08:33.544
you made the sex
all about her body,

08:33.611 --> 08:35.913
and a woman wants it
to be about the mind.

08:35.981 --> 08:39.183
Oh, crap. I was afraid
it would be
about that sort of thing.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.686
Look, she is an intelligent,
interesting woman.

08:41.754 --> 08:44.305
And you just
need to remind her
that you notice that--

08:44.373 --> 08:46.790
unlike, say, I don't know,
<i>L.A. Woman</i> magazine,

08:46.858 --> 08:48.359
that only cares about
how a woman looks.

08:48.477 --> 08:50.477
So, we're off
my thing, huh?

08:50.596 --> 08:51.629
Hopefully forever, yes.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.197
I ran into the editor
of that magazine

08:53.265 --> 08:55.532
over at Cam and Mitch's today,
and you know what?

08:55.600 --> 08:56.834
He looks me up and down.

08:56.885 --> 08:59.387
Suddenly, I am off
their Women in Business list.

08:59.454 --> 09:01.522
So,<i> L.A. Woman</i> is
its own magazine now?

09:01.590 --> 09:04.274
I remember when it was
the back page of <i> L.A. Man.</i>

09:04.342 --> 09:07.495
Well, I suppose I'm just not
as glamorous as Linda Vaughn,

09:07.563 --> 09:09.663
the queen of
corrective shoes.

09:09.731 --> 09:11.348
And this has nothing to do
with the fact
that you showed up

09:11.416 --> 09:14.051
looking like someone
who just watered some horses?

09:14.119 --> 09:15.486
Who cares?
What about merit?

09:15.554 --> 09:17.238
I hear you.
But you got to play the game.

09:17.305 --> 09:18.606
I didn't get
on the cover

09:18.624 --> 09:21.342
of <i> Closet Time's</i>
September '78 issue

09:21.460 --> 09:25.145
by wearing Jordache jeans
one size too big.

09:25.213 --> 09:26.063
I'm not doing it.

09:26.131 --> 09:27.665
They can keep
their beauty contest.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.800
I don't care.

09:28.867 --> 09:30.834
Before you say no,
take a look at this.

09:32.637 --> 09:34.772
It's not making the case
you think it's making, Dad.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.857
Oh, God.

09:39.611 --> 09:40.795
Okay, that's all
the phones.

09:40.862 --> 09:42.914
Look, nobody's gonna find out
about you losing your job

09:42.981 --> 09:44.264
until after the party.

09:45.066 --> 09:46.700
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna get that.

09:46.768 --> 09:47.968
You call someone
about returning the piano

09:48.036 --> 09:49.937
we can no longer afford.

09:50.005 --> 09:54.174
Well, we couldn't
really afford it
<i>with</i> your new job, either.

09:54.242 --> 09:56.527
Why haven't you been
texting me back?

09:56.594 --> 09:57.828
Well, uh--

09:57.896 --> 10:00.098
You're judging us, aren't you?
No.

10:00.165 --> 10:02.583
This is nothing compared to
the things that I have heard

10:02.650 --> 10:04.435
that you two do--
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:04.503 --> 10:05.636
I-I never saw
your text, okay?

10:05.703 --> 10:06.938
All of our phones
are in a bowl.

10:07.005 --> 10:09.373
Oh, it's <i> that</i> kind
of party.

10:09.441 --> 10:11.024
What do you think
that we do?

10:11.093 --> 10:12.376
I have a problem.

10:12.443 --> 10:13.778
Well, can it wait?
I have guests.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.596
Your father spanked me.

10:15.664 --> 10:17.131
Eh, it's a buffet.
They'll be fine.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.267
Oh, my G...
Okay, talked to the piano
company--

10:19.334 --> 10:21.435
Okay, okay,
my dad spanked her.
You're all caught up.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.454
What?
What did you do?

10:23.572 --> 10:25.439
I screamed,
he ran away.

10:25.506 --> 10:27.124
And now I think
he's embarrassed.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.826
Okay, okay.

10:28.894 --> 10:31.078
For what it's worth,
sometimes people do
things to other people

10:31.145 --> 10:32.763
that they want done
to themselves.

10:32.831 --> 10:33.831
Mm-hmm.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.133
Sometimes,
for years on end.

10:36.201 --> 10:37.684
Really?
Mm-hmm.

10:37.752 --> 10:41.438
So, you think that
Jay wants me to spank him?

10:41.506 --> 10:42.723
Well, if he's like
some of the successful,

10:42.790 --> 10:44.958
powerful men
I've been with, yes.

10:44.993 --> 10:47.645
Who are these men?
What are these things I don't
do?

10:47.713 --> 10:50.431
Well, I guess I could ask him
if that's what he wants.

10:50.499 --> 10:51.916
No, no, no, no, no. Don't do
that.
Mm.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.801
He's probably already
feeling self-conscious.

10:53.869 --> 10:56.787
Act casual,
like it never happened.

10:56.805 --> 10:58.188
I can do that.

10:59.758 --> 11:00.574
I haven't even
said anything

11:00.642 --> 11:02.943
about this gigantic piano
you have here.

11:03.011 --> 11:05.646
Okay. Well, if it doesn't
go back today, we own it,

11:05.714 --> 11:07.014
so the moving company
is on the way.

11:07.082 --> 11:09.283
Okay, well, I think our guests
are gonna notice that,

11:09.351 --> 11:10.884
maybe ask a question
or two.

11:10.952 --> 11:11.769
I've got this.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.371
Hey, guys.
Hi, guys.

11:14.439 --> 11:16.624
Mitchell and I...
Maybe just Cam. Not sure yet.

11:16.692 --> 11:19.326
...are about to remodel our
bathroom,
and we were wondering,

11:19.394 --> 11:21.879
does anyone here have
strong opinions

11:21.947 --> 11:24.114
about interior design?
I do.

11:24.182 --> 11:25.315
Oh, me. Oh, me.
Okay.

11:25.383 --> 11:27.484
Can you guys, uh,
follow me right this way?

11:27.552 --> 11:29.871
All right, everybody in.
Yep, there's plenty of room.

11:29.938 --> 11:31.455
And I'll-I'll just
close the door,

11:31.522 --> 11:34.442
give you guys some privacy
so you can speak freely.

11:34.509 --> 11:35.793
There you go.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.778
All right.
And, oh, look at that.

11:37.846 --> 11:40.447
The... doorknob came off.

11:40.515 --> 11:42.466
Sit tight.
I got to fix this.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.001
Hey, Dad.

11:44.069 --> 11:45.386
Hey, sweetie.
What are you doing here?

11:45.454 --> 11:47.638
Did you really think
I wouldn't notice these?

11:47.706 --> 11:49.623
Also, I got
that internship.

11:49.691 --> 11:51.308
I just need your signature
on my insurance form.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.561
I told you
to stay positive.

11:53.728 --> 11:55.579
How much fun
is this gonna be?

11:55.647 --> 11:57.364
It's really not
about fun.

11:57.432 --> 11:58.666
It's gonna be
a lot of hard work.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.000
The pressure's
off the charts.

12:00.068 --> 12:02.286
Well, that would explain
the mental health waiver.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.905
The last undergrad
they let into the program
completely snapped.

12:04.973 --> 12:06.173
They found her
wandering the Freedom Trail

12:06.241 --> 12:07.975
wearing nothing
but her safety goggles.

12:09.410 --> 12:12.379
Dunphy, you're in
my spot again.

12:12.447 --> 12:14.699
That's her.
She's your bully?

12:14.766 --> 12:16.267
You realize she's not even
that big, right?

12:16.335 --> 12:18.535
It's mostly just hair.
Shh, shh.

12:18.603 --> 12:19.653
Who's the jock?

12:19.721 --> 12:22.139
Oh, Stephanie,
this is my daughter Alex.

12:22.307 --> 12:23.607
Uh, Alex,
this is Stephanie.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.659
She owns the board game shop
next door.

12:25.727 --> 12:27.728
Yeah. I sell
<i>Magic: The Gathering,</i>

12:27.796 --> 12:30.464
and he sells magic,
and no one is gathering.

12:30.565 --> 12:31.698
Come on.

12:31.766 --> 12:33.234
Dad, remember
what we talked about.

12:33.301 --> 12:35.352
Oh, yeah.
Technically...

12:37.940 --> 12:40.624
...spot nine is
a shared parking space.

12:40.692 --> 12:44.211
Ooh, look whose
disappearing balls came back.

12:44.279 --> 12:46.747
What do you say we settle this
once and for all

12:46.815 --> 12:48.249
with the newly released
collector's edition

12:48.316 --> 12:49.767
of <i> Wizards and Warlocks?</i>

12:49.802 --> 12:51.101
Set her up.

12:51.169 --> 12:52.720
I'm done being
pushed around by you.

12:52.787 --> 12:55.222
Winner gets the spot.
It's a role-playing game.

12:55.290 --> 12:56.707
I'm Zorel,
a 19th-level wizard

12:56.774 --> 12:59.426
with 30 gold ingots and
a cow who used to be my son.

12:59.494 --> 13:01.211
I'm familiar with the game.
I go to Caltech.

13:01.279 --> 13:03.447
The guy who invented it
gave our commencement speech
last year.

13:03.515 --> 13:04.782
Okay, Dunphy.

13:04.849 --> 13:07.084
When we left off, you had just
sold your long sword

13:07.152 --> 13:08.969
for some beans.
Which could've been magic.

13:09.036 --> 13:10.271
There was no indication
of that.

13:10.338 --> 13:11.906
Dad, where's all
your gold?

13:11.974 --> 13:13.623
I found that Zorel
doesn't like to
be weighed down

13:13.691 --> 13:15.309
by too many
worldly possessions.

13:15.376 --> 13:17.645
But the key is to pillage
early and trade
your gold for weapons

13:17.712 --> 13:20.297
before the Van Wickle
gates open
and the ogres are released.

13:20.365 --> 13:23.033
Curse card.
Your hands are now hooves.

13:23.101 --> 13:24.802
Your roll.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.070
Uh, but first, a proposal--

13:26.137 --> 13:28.922
my shield
for your feathered cap.

13:28.990 --> 13:30.541
I can't watch this.
Give me those.

13:30.608 --> 13:31.742
Up.

13:33.528 --> 13:36.847
Hmm. Hmm.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.382
Ah, I see where
you're going with this--

13:38.449 --> 13:40.634
calling for a peace conference
with the council of elders.

13:40.702 --> 13:42.553
No. I'm putting the council
of elders on our ships

13:42.721 --> 13:44.772
and burning them.
Go.

13:45.874 --> 13:49.377
I'm here, casually reading
a magazine, Jay.

13:49.444 --> 13:50.744
There's my brainiac.

13:50.812 --> 13:51.845
You didn't even
have to turn around.

13:51.947 --> 13:53.247
You knew it was me.

13:53.315 --> 13:54.498
Oh, well,
Manny's at school,

13:54.566 --> 13:56.934
and Joe doesn't have a key,
so...

13:57.002 --> 13:58.185
What are you
tearing through?

13:58.252 --> 14:00.771
Nothing. Just, like,
a fashion magazine.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.240
In English,
your second language.

14:03.307 --> 14:04.925
With all that information
in your head,

14:04.992 --> 14:07.310
we should be calling you
Encyclopedia Brown--

14:07.378 --> 14:09.129
which sounds like a slur
but isn't.

14:09.214 --> 14:10.581
Hey, I'll bet you can help me
with something

14:10.648 --> 14:12.433
I've been struggling with.
I doubt it.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.585
Come on, give me a thrill.
Take a whack at it.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.736
What exactly do you
want me to do?

14:16.804 --> 14:19.540
I'm sure you can
figure out this clue.

14:19.607 --> 14:21.809
Come on, one across.
Help me get started.

14:23.679 --> 14:26.146
Ow! What the hell?!

14:26.148 --> 14:27.381
What the hell?!

14:27.383 --> 14:30.351
I'll clean my room,
I promise!

14:34.622 --> 14:36.540
Ha.
Damn it.

14:36.607 --> 14:38.159
You made it to
the Summit of Exmore.

14:38.226 --> 14:39.694
It exists?

14:39.761 --> 14:42.396
Whoa. I need to get
these forms in by 5:00

14:42.463 --> 14:43.897
if I'm gonna
take this internship,

14:43.949 --> 14:45.950
which I obviously am because
I've been working for this

14:46.284 --> 14:47.534
my entire life.

14:47.536 --> 14:50.370
Dad, take over.
You're basically
in an unlosable position.

14:52.991 --> 14:54.892
You appear to be
at a crossroads--

14:54.959 --> 14:56.160
battle the guards
at the summit gate

14:56.211 --> 14:58.144
or take a portal
to lands unknown.

14:58.212 --> 15:01.331
This would be so much easier
if it was lands known.

15:01.466 --> 15:03.350
You're not actually struggling
with this, are you?

15:03.418 --> 15:06.019
But what if the portal leads
to someplace really cool?

15:06.087 --> 15:07.938
You win by getting
to the summit.

15:08.006 --> 15:10.608
There's a 62% chance
that portal leads right back
to the meadow.

15:10.675 --> 15:12.059
That's math.

15:12.126 --> 15:15.696
You're in a house
of... magic.

15:15.764 --> 15:17.230
And you're back
in the meadow.

15:17.298 --> 15:18.482
What were you thinking?

15:18.549 --> 15:20.234
It's fine.
You know, legend has it,

15:20.318 --> 15:22.386
there's a shortcut under
one of the toadstools there.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.788
You don't win
by taking shortcuts!

15:24.856 --> 15:28.025
You win by taking the lead--
which is what I did for you

15:28.093 --> 15:29.710
by methodically
clawing up the mountain,

15:29.777 --> 15:31.711
ruthlessly defeating
your enemies,

15:31.779 --> 15:32.930
and then emerging
victorious--

15:32.997 --> 15:35.750
not dithering around
in some meadow!

15:35.817 --> 15:37.351
I'm gonna step out
for a vape break

15:37.418 --> 15:40.137
while you two
sort this out.

15:42.340 --> 15:43.890
You know why
I like the meadow?

15:43.958 --> 15:46.360
'Cause it lets me think about
what I want to do next.

15:46.428 --> 15:48.762
Should I battle the ogre

15:48.830 --> 15:51.548
or brave
the Swamps of Despair?

15:51.616 --> 15:56.103
Should I take
the super stressful
internship in Boston,

15:56.188 --> 15:59.206
or am I doing that
just because
I think I'm supposed to?

15:59.274 --> 16:02.309
I beat out
hundreds of candidates.

16:02.377 --> 16:04.562
I would be working with the
preeminent scholar
in the field.

16:04.629 --> 16:06.880
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

16:06.948 --> 16:09.149
Yeah, but it's
your lifetime.

16:09.217 --> 16:10.717
It's okay to enjoy it.

16:11.987 --> 16:13.703
No one turns this down.

16:13.771 --> 16:17.908
Well, you always liked being
the first one to do something.

16:17.992 --> 16:19.593
Give yourself
the summer you want.

16:19.661 --> 16:21.212
You've collected
enough gold ingots

16:21.279 --> 16:22.997
to buy yourself
some time off.

16:23.064 --> 16:24.898
It won't make me lazy,
will it?

16:24.966 --> 16:28.652
Honey,
you walked at six months,

16:28.720 --> 16:30.270
spoke at a year,

16:30.338 --> 16:34.025
and your first words were
"Sorry it took me
so long to walk."

16:38.529 --> 16:40.347
Okay, the piano's gone.

16:40.414 --> 16:42.199
Oh, by the way,
that sound you heard

16:42.267 --> 16:44.001
was the bottom of the truck
scraping against the street,

16:44.069 --> 16:45.619
so...
Okay, yeah.

16:45.686 --> 16:47.053
Yeah, I don't know, Cam.
Is this really gonna sell it?

16:47.121 --> 16:48.439
Yes, it is.

16:48.506 --> 16:51.308
I've learned in my 36 years
that, if you believe a lie,

16:51.376 --> 16:52.643
others will, too.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.427
Okay,
release the guests.

16:54.495 --> 16:55.595
Okay.

16:57.299 --> 16:58.648
Okay, all fixed.

16:58.716 --> 17:01.501
Figures. Just as your Xanax
is kicking in.

17:03.054 --> 17:04.088
Hey, guys, so, listen.

17:04.156 --> 17:07.040
We've kept you cooped up
on this beautiful day.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.194
Why don't we turn this party
into a garden party?

17:11.630 --> 17:12.762
Why is your piano
covered with a sheet?

17:12.829 --> 17:15.397
Oh, um, well,
because they recommend it.

17:15.465 --> 17:18.352
They say even five minutes of
direct sunlight on a new piano

17:18.419 --> 17:20.471
like this, your keyboard
turns into something like

17:20.539 --> 17:21.671
an English person's
teeth, so...

17:21.739 --> 17:23.156
Huh.
Yeah.

17:23.223 --> 17:24.675
Okay, well, so
why doesn't everyone just...

17:24.742 --> 17:25.792
Yeah.
...grab some
appetizers and any

17:25.859 --> 17:27.011
wine that's already opened...

17:27.078 --> 17:28.996
Already opened wine.
Yeah. Perfect.

17:29.064 --> 17:30.213
Hello, boys.

17:30.281 --> 17:31.315
What are you
doing here?

17:31.382 --> 17:32.416
Didn't you get my text?

17:32.484 --> 17:33.684
No, all of our phones
are in a bowl.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.635
Ew.
It's not dirty...

17:35.703 --> 17:37.254
unlike that dress.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.355
Hi, Sam.

17:38.423 --> 17:39.757
Oh, my God.

17:39.824 --> 17:41.858
Okay, you're that desperate
to get into the magazine?

17:41.926 --> 17:43.894
No. I am going to expose him
for the fraud that he is.

17:43.961 --> 17:47.531
He claims that his precious
little list is merit-based.

17:47.599 --> 17:50.100
When I was wearing sweatpants,
he wasn't interested.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.685
Now that I've gussied up
a little...

17:51.753 --> 17:53.254
He's gonna put you
on the cover.

17:53.321 --> 17:54.922
Really?
Do you think? Shut up.

17:54.989 --> 17:57.424
Hey, Cam, there was an article
in an old <i> Details</i> magazine

17:57.492 --> 17:58.308
I was reading
in your bathroom

17:58.477 --> 18:00.560
about the need
to support your friends.

18:00.628 --> 18:02.846
We do want to
hear you play.

18:02.914 --> 18:04.014
No, you know what?
Let's not. Let's not.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.682
I just don't even feel like
I'm in the mood anymore.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.501
You're a bigger liar
than your scale.

18:07.569 --> 18:09.053
Come on.
One song.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.137
No one gets to leave this room
until you do.

18:10.271 --> 18:11.322
Okay, well...

18:11.389 --> 18:14.391
I must say,
you do look beautiful.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.026
You remind me of
my first beard.

18:16.094 --> 18:17.344
Thank you.

18:17.412 --> 18:20.364
I'm a lady in the streets and
a freak in the spreadsheets.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.048
It's not a bad caption,
if you're still interested

18:22.116 --> 18:23.767
in using me
in your magazine.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.737
Sounds a little... thin.

18:26.805 --> 18:27.972
Oh, well,
all the best ones do.

18:28.039 --> 18:31.007
You're probably used to
a cheaper, fuller-sounding,

18:31.059 --> 18:32.926
uncovered piano.

18:32.994 --> 18:37.531
♪ Another bride,
another groom ♪

18:37.598 --> 18:40.317
Oh, from

18:42.470 --> 18:44.605

Wait,
where's the piano?

18:57.118 --> 18:59.185
I'm-I'm fine,
by the way.

18:59.253 --> 19:01.505
So, we did get rid
of the piano.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.106
Um, we-we can't
afford it anymore.

19:03.174 --> 19:06.059
That great job that I had?
Uh, I lost it.

19:06.127 --> 19:07.394
So...

19:07.461 --> 19:09.746
<i>I couldn't have been</i>
<i>more wrong</i>
<i>about our friends.</i>

19:09.814 --> 19:12.365
I mean, yes, yes,
they can be snarky at times,

19:12.433 --> 19:14.601
but when I really
needed their support,

19:14.669 --> 19:15.903
they were completely
there for me.

19:15.971 --> 19:17.203
You know, you should take
a look at your life

19:17.271 --> 19:19.439
and see what happened
to make you so untrusting.

19:19.507 --> 19:21.325
I should.
G-Gaw!

19:21.392 --> 19:22.910
And to think we-we locked them
in that bathroom

19:22.978 --> 19:23.977
for no reason.

19:24.044 --> 19:25.045
That couldn't have
been fun.

19:25.112 --> 19:26.379
Yeah, I know.

19:26.447 --> 19:28.482
Uh, the same thing happened
to me once, remember?

19:28.550 --> 19:30.283
When that-- the handle
accidentally fell off.

19:30.351 --> 19:31.935
The-the-the night
of our first fight.

19:31.986 --> 19:34.137
Yeah.
Yeah, vaguely.

19:36.024 --> 19:38.191
That was
an accident, right?

19:38.259 --> 19:40.494
- Cam.
- Did you fix the doorknob yet?

19:40.561 --> 19:41.662
Just another minute,
sweetie.

19:41.729 --> 19:42.963
Cam!

19:42.998 --> 19:46.183
I talked to Joe

19:46.185 --> 19:47.484
about what he saw,

19:47.552 --> 19:49.036
and he's not scared
anymore.

19:49.103 --> 19:50.721
Great. Can you do
the same for me?

19:50.789 --> 19:51.888
I'm sorry I did
that to you,

19:52.057 --> 19:54.174
but I really thought that
that's what you wanted

19:54.241 --> 19:55.825
because that's what
you did to me.

19:55.893 --> 19:57.261
But I heard you tell Rebecca
you thought

19:57.328 --> 19:58.762
that spanking would help.

19:58.847 --> 20:01.248
With Joe and his room.

20:01.316 --> 20:03.984
So... it was
a misunderstanding.

20:04.051 --> 20:05.285
Exactly.

20:05.352 --> 20:06.853
So, there's nothing missing
from our love life.

20:06.938 --> 20:08.706
Right.
Right.

20:11.109 --> 20:14.127
Yeah, but, you know,
that nothing is missing

20:14.195 --> 20:16.830
doesn't mean that we cannot
add a little something to it.

20:16.898 --> 20:17.914
I guess, being honest,

20:17.982 --> 20:20.634
I've got a... few requests
for the band.

20:20.669 --> 20:22.152
Like what?

20:23.221 --> 20:24.988
No, I feel weird
talking about it.

20:25.055 --> 20:26.540
Why don't we write
some of this stuff down,

20:26.625 --> 20:28.775
toss it in a hat,
and see what we pull out?

20:28.843 --> 20:29.727
Ah!

20:29.794 --> 20:31.378
You fired that right off.

20:31.446 --> 20:33.997
That one sounds fun.

20:34.065 --> 20:34.998
No peeking.

20:35.066 --> 20:37.801
Ay, I said I was gonna do that
one.
Oh.

20:37.835 --> 20:39.953
Right.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.689
Let's take it upstairs.
Okay.

20:46.076 --> 20:47.894
What's this?
Oh, you know what?

20:47.962 --> 20:50.614
I think that is the hat that
Manny uses to play charades.

20:50.681 --> 20:52.549
That's a relief,
because I don't
think I'm flexible enough

20:52.617 --> 20:54.651
for a
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."

20:58.256 --> 21:01.908
You ready for round two?
Of course, I am.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.528
What are you doing
down there?

21:04.596 --> 21:06.046
It says,
"My Left Foot."

21:06.114 --> 21:07.931
You got another movie.

21:09.033 --> 21:10.784
God, that was amazing.
What do you call that?

21:10.852 --> 21:13.220
That's a
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

21:13.288 --> 21:14.254
You sure about this?

21:14.322 --> 21:16.573
Honey, don't give me a chance
to change my mind.

21:16.624 --> 21:18.091
I am Zorel,

21:18.143 --> 21:21.394
fifth-level wizard,
master of the meadow.

21:21.462 --> 21:24.865
You can keep the beard,
but no talking.
