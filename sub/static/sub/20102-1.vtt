02:55.441 --> 02:56.475
- Should we pack everything?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.475
I mean, how long
are we gonna be?

02:58.477 --> 03:01.313
- I don't really know
how fucking long but just

03:01.315 --> 03:02.948
pack everything up and do
it as quickly as possible,

03:02.950 --> 03:03.950
okay?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.655
- Jason?

03:12.927 --> 03:16.261
- Just pack everything,
right now.

03:16.263 --> 03:17.263
- Okay.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.799
- It's gonna be okay.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.403
- Okay, okay.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.940
- Berries.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.476
Red berries.

05:15.916 --> 05:16.916
Okay.

05:41.941 --> 05:42.941
Okay.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.480
Okay.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.111
- The department
of health has been notified

07:26.113 --> 07:28.713
by the federal emergency
management agency

07:28.715 --> 07:32.551
that a viral infection has
severely infected the population.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.619
Symptoms of the virus
include a small circular

07:34.621 --> 07:37.122
red rash on the abdomen
or chest and is followed

07:37.124 --> 07:39.758
by nausea, delirium and
aggressive outbursts

07:39.760 --> 07:41.226
or unpredictable behavior.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.029
If you or anyone you know are
exhibiting these symptoms,

07:44.031 --> 07:46.832
immediately contact
emergency medical services.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.767
Officials have been
advised that at this time

07:48.769 --> 07:51.903
the viral infection poses an
immediate danger to the public.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.573
As a precaution, resident
should stay indoors,

07:54.575 --> 07:56.975
keep all windows, doors and
vents closed.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.144
Turn off all air
conditioners, ration your...

08:02.649 --> 08:04.516
- Stop, stop the car.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.018
Jason stop the car.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.921
Christ, Jason,
stop the fucking car.

08:09.923 --> 08:10.789
They have a child.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.791
- So do we!

08:12.592 --> 08:13.592
Okay?

08:16.529 --> 08:17.529
So do we.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.907
- Hi there, how are you?

09:36.943 --> 09:40.745
Looks like it's going
to be a beautiful day.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.718
Do you want to play?

09:49.289 --> 09:53.124
I miss you, hope to see
you soon.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.899
- One, two, three, four.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.640
One, two, three, four.

10:13.145 --> 10:14.679
One, two, three.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.230
Fuck, fuck!

11:09.903 --> 11:10.903
Fuck.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.841
- The most important thing
here is the saw-tooth leaf.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.375
Turns red during the spring
time.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.377
See that?

12:26.278 --> 12:27.912
Okay.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.215
How to make a deadfall trap,
you need a

12:30.217 --> 12:32.150
support stick, a weight
stick, a bait stick.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.150
Okay?

12:33.152 --> 12:37.021
And you set them up, notches
matching, balance the...

12:37.023 --> 12:39.791
Ann, are you listening?

12:39.793 --> 12:41.791
This is important.

12:41.793 --> 12:45.363
- Yes, I can't write as fast
as you can fucking talk.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.365
Okay.

12:50.336 --> 12:53.004
- Don't curse in front of her.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.775
- Fine.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.347
- Red berries.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.349
Red leaves.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.117
It's a bad thing.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.354
Especially during the spring.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.863
You're jerking the trigger.

13:18.865 --> 13:19.998
- And I hit it!

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
- That's 'cause it's not moving.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.569
It's a rabbit gun, you need
to hit head or heart to kill

13:24.571 --> 13:27.238
so I need you to control
your breathing and lightly...

13:27.240 --> 13:29.440
- squeeze, not pull, I know.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.110
We should save our bullets.

13:32.112 --> 13:36.147
- Well, they're of no use if
you don't know how to shoot.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.082
- How many do we have?

13:39.051 --> 13:40.051
- Enough.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.487
Do it again.

14:02.942 --> 14:06.477
- We can't survive on
a handful of berries.

14:09.448 --> 14:10.448
- I know.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.445
- Hi there, how are you?

14:43.016 --> 14:47.418
Looks like it's going
to be a beautiful day.

15:13.479 --> 15:14.479
- Okay.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.822
- Hi there, how are you?

17:37.824 --> 17:39.791
Hi there, how are you?

17:39.793 --> 17:41.759
Hi there, how are you?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.795
Hi there, how are you?

17:43.797 --> 17:45.830
Hi there, how are you?

17:45.832 --> 17:48.099
Hi there, how are you?

17:48.101 --> 17:50.068
Hi there, how are you?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.836
Hi there, how are you?

17:51.838 --> 17:54.105
Hi there, how are you?

17:54.107 --> 17:56.274
Hi there, how are you?

20:46.745 --> 20:47.745
- Damn it!

21:39.498 --> 21:40.498
Fuck!

22:30.983 --> 22:32.783
Jason, what happened?

22:32.785 --> 22:33.984
- No, don't touch me!

22:33.986 --> 22:36.554
Just get everything in the car.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.022
- What happened?

22:38.024 --> 22:40.524
- Just get in the fucking car!

22:51.636 --> 22:53.003
Her fever break?

22:53.005 --> 22:54.138
- No.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.539
Jason, what happened?

22:57.477 --> 22:59.477
- There were a few boxes
of food.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.479
- But they were there.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.481
- Yeah.

23:03.682 --> 23:05.416
They were there.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.685
- But you've avoided them
before.

23:07.687 --> 23:08.919
Why did they attack this time?

23:08.921 --> 23:10.087
I don't know.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.089
I don't.

23:12.791 --> 23:16.994
There was enough food to eat
there, there was enough bodies.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.767
I thought they would've
moved on.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.738
Everything was fine until
I cut myself breaking

23:27.740 --> 23:29.073
into that house.

23:29.941 --> 23:33.611
The blood started flowing
and screams grew

23:35.814 --> 23:37.415
and they swarmed.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.555
It was like they knew.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.690
They knew I was bleeding.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.661
They could sense it.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.130
- What are they?

23:56.468 --> 23:57.735
- I don't know.

24:00.839 --> 24:04.008
But some part of them is human.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.810
- Why is that?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.114
- Because they can die.

25:26.892 --> 25:29.693
- Come on, come on.

25:44.643 --> 25:45.643
Come on.

25:49.681 --> 25:50.915
Come on.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.785
Please.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.035
Please, please.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.003
Chris.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.043
- Is he infected?

26:23.214 --> 26:24.281
- No.

26:29.054 --> 26:30.588
- Show me.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.109
- Your name?

26:54.045 --> 26:55.045
- Olivia.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.284
You'll help him?

27:02.954 --> 27:04.154
I can do that.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.663
- Press here.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.166
He'll be okay.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.007
Grab an arm.

28:14.759 --> 28:16.960
You coming from the south?

28:18.163 --> 28:19.096
You and your father...

28:19.098 --> 28:20.098
- stepdad.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.134
Well, sort of.

28:24.136 --> 28:28.072
Chris and my mom were,
you know, together, but

28:29.340 --> 28:31.075
they never married.

28:32.477 --> 28:35.746
They planned it for September,
but...

28:44.456 --> 28:47.858
- You can sleep in the car
if you want.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.926
- No, it's fine.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.061
I want to sleep near him.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.802
We'll leave, when he's better,
I mean.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.439
We'll leave you alone.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.944
Why do you have two campsites?

30:13.946 --> 30:16.980
- In case I lose one
or the other.

30:16.982 --> 30:17.982
- Oh.

31:08.533 --> 31:12.202
- Helps cover your scent,
throws them off.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.225
You headed north?

32:09.994 --> 32:10.994
- Yeah.

32:13.197 --> 32:15.399
- You wanna hear it?

33:01.546 --> 33:03.680
- That's what's up north?

33:05.416 --> 33:06.416
- Mm-hmm.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.387
- Do you know what
they're saying?

33:10.389 --> 33:11.389
- No.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.263
- So that's it.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.634
- That's all there is.

33:45.556 --> 33:47.157
- Chris?

33:49.494 --> 33:51.128
- It's alright, Liv.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.065
It's okay.

34:03.708 --> 34:07.110
- She says you're heading north.

34:07.745 --> 34:10.213
- Yeah, trying to at least.

34:12.350 --> 34:15.085
We hear it's in check up there.

34:15.786 --> 34:18.188
Who the fuck knows, right?

34:24.562 --> 34:27.496
You have a pretty nice setup
here.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.668
Most people would kill
for this stuff.

34:33.538 --> 34:34.804
You gotta tent.

34:35.773 --> 34:37.641
Food, from what I can tell.

34:37.643 --> 34:38.643
Car.

34:44.215 --> 34:47.217
You gotta full tank?
- No.

34:50.688 --> 34:53.690
Just a place to hide
from the rain.

35:08.339 --> 35:09.539
- Ugh.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.480
Thank you.

35:20.251 --> 35:23.120
For what you did,
for both of us.

35:24.555 --> 35:28.291
Not a lot of people
would do that nowadays.

35:33.865 --> 35:36.566
We'll be gone in the morning.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.568
- Okay.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.706
- Get up, kiddo, let's go.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.641
Let's get in the tent.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.585
- Come on, get in!

36:59.250 --> 37:01.918
- So, how long you been
out here?

37:02.887 --> 37:04.621
- Since it started.

37:06.824 --> 37:07.991
- Hmm.

37:10.428 --> 37:14.631
Why you all the way out here
in the middle of nowhere?

37:17.735 --> 37:21.371
- My husband grew up
in these woods.

37:21.373 --> 37:24.507
He lived in a town
a mile or two west.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.509
He brought us out here.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.946
It's where he felt safest.

37:32.016 --> 37:36.353
- Is that who taught you
how to be woods woman-y?

37:40.725 --> 37:43.326
- He taught me what he could.

37:44.695 --> 37:45.795
- What?

37:45.797 --> 37:47.264
- Come on, Liv.

38:42.386 --> 38:43.785
We kept hearing things,
you know.

38:43.787 --> 38:45.955
How Philly went down in
a day but some backwater,

38:45.957 --> 38:50.527
berg like bethel didn't
get hit for a month.

38:50.529 --> 38:54.431
So Suzanne, Liv's mom,
she said, "let's wait."

38:56.901 --> 38:58.968
Let's just fucking wait.

39:00.805 --> 39:03.873
She even thought that the
red cross was handing out

39:03.875 --> 39:06.609
the cure in bottles over
in trout run.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.013
Turns out they were just
handing out hot chocolate

39:10.015 --> 39:11.948
and cheese sandwiches.

39:14.885 --> 39:18.555
And then Suzy got some sores
on her belly,

39:21.459 --> 39:24.361
they just looked like
little circles.

39:24.363 --> 39:25.363
You know?

39:26.497 --> 39:27.964
Little flea bites.

39:31.569 --> 39:34.637
And then they started
getting worse.

39:35.506 --> 39:39.709
Started bleeding and giving
off some sort of white puss.

39:41.946 --> 39:43.747
Two days later, she,
she attacked Liv.

39:50.721 --> 39:55.492
She tried to rip her
apart with her bare hands.

39:59.997 --> 40:03.133
So that's when I tied her
to the bed.

40:06.036 --> 40:08.505
And all she did was scream.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.780
We left her there
for a few days.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.787
Just listening to her scream.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.727
- You just left her?

40:30.729 --> 40:32.061
Tied to the bed?

40:42.506 --> 40:43.506
- In a way,

40:46.076 --> 40:47.076
yeah.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.050
I took a kitchen knife and,

40:57.021 --> 40:58.888
shoved it in her ear.

41:01.025 --> 41:03.960
And I kept on pushing
and pushing.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.231
Until the screams stopped.

41:16.907 --> 41:21.077
I like to think that
she forgave me, though.

41:21.079 --> 41:25.148
That she heard me say I'm
sorry and believed it.

42:29.146 --> 42:30.880
- Oh, my god, oh my god, no!

42:30.882 --> 42:31.748
- Come on, you're going in!

42:31.750 --> 42:32.682
Here we go!

42:32.684 --> 42:33.684
Bath time.

42:37.988 --> 42:40.256
What, I didn't even throw
you in.

42:40.258 --> 42:41.256
- Oh my god.

42:41.258 --> 42:42.892
- These waters aren't
even that cold.

42:42.894 --> 42:46.095
- Oh man.
- See, it's nice.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.298
- It looks awful.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.668
- I don't trust you
behind me, get out of here.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.336
- Well, I can push you.

43:04.282 --> 43:07.884
God, are there even
any fish here?

43:07.886 --> 43:10.053
- Law of the lake, Liv.

43:10.055 --> 43:13.923
Where there are fishermen,
there are no fish.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.694
- Yeah, but we're on a river.

43:18.797 --> 43:21.130
- Rules still apply.

43:24.134 --> 43:25.868
I went on this fishing
trip once with Matt Theil.

43:25.870 --> 43:27.870
You remember Matt, Liv?

43:30.240 --> 43:32.942
Guy was built like a fucking
tank.

43:32.944 --> 43:36.813
He could open bottles
of beer with his teeth.

43:37.781 --> 43:40.016
Use to play call of duty 24/7.

43:40.018 --> 43:42.752
Anyway, Matt rented a boat one
time, well, it wasn't really

43:42.754 --> 43:44.654
a boat, it was more of a skiff.

43:44.656 --> 43:46.389
Tiny one at that, couldn't
even fit a case of fucking

43:46.391 --> 43:47.757
natty light in it.

43:47.759 --> 43:48.759
- Stop.

43:50.394 --> 43:51.995
- What?

43:51.997 --> 43:52.997
- Just

43:53.964 --> 43:54.964
stop.

43:57.234 --> 43:58.234
- Okay.

44:16.086 --> 44:20.023
Hey, why did you stop
me earlier at the river?

44:23.994 --> 44:26.829
- You know sometimes you,

44:26.831 --> 44:30.299
it feels like you forget
what's out there.

44:31.368 --> 44:33.670
I don't know, one minute
you're telling me about

44:33.672 --> 44:36.139
how you killed your wife.

44:36.141 --> 44:38.708
And the next, it's just like,

44:39.943 --> 44:42.378
we're on a weekend camping trip.

44:42.380 --> 44:45.848
We'll all return to normalcy
on Monday.

44:46.450 --> 44:49.452
You know those rings
your wife had?

44:52.156 --> 44:56.259
We saw them before anyone
knew what was going on.

44:57.327 --> 45:01.464
We get patients in the
er oozing puss and blood.

45:03.834 --> 45:07.437
The rings just devouring
the skin around it.

45:09.006 --> 45:13.209
Feeding on it like it knew
what it was gonna become.

45:17.281 --> 45:20.883
The only thing keeping them
down there

45:20.885 --> 45:24.921
is the fact that they haven't
eaten all the bodies yet.

45:24.923 --> 45:27.857
You know, all those people
like your wife,

45:27.859 --> 45:30.326
just left and tied to the bed.

45:33.097 --> 45:34.097
I can't.

45:35.833 --> 45:38.835
I can't just choose to forget
that.

45:44.808 --> 45:46.275
- I didn't forget.

45:47.911 --> 45:52.482
I just choose what to remember
and when to remember it.

46:04.828 --> 46:06.896
Get some sleep, alright?

46:13.037 --> 46:14.137
- They took two
houses before I found

46:14.139 --> 46:15.471
the last amount.

46:18.041 --> 46:22.011
- Hailey needs something
to bring her fever down.

46:22.013 --> 46:23.412
And we need food.

46:25.182 --> 46:26.916
You can't just quit.

46:30.487 --> 46:34.290
You brought us out here
for a reason, Jason.

46:37.194 --> 46:38.928
This was your call.

46:39.963 --> 46:41.297
And we survived.

46:43.834 --> 46:45.168
We've gotten by.

46:46.904 --> 46:48.971
- Getting by isn't life.

46:50.908 --> 46:54.177
- Getting by is all
we have left.

47:01.852 --> 47:03.119
You need to go.

47:10.460 --> 47:11.460
- Yeah.

47:18.435 --> 47:20.603
Will this mud work?

47:20.605 --> 47:23.005
- I don't know.

47:23.007 --> 47:25.341
Should mask the scent.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.909
- Right.

47:26.911 --> 47:27.911
- Gosh.

47:29.214 --> 47:30.214
I'm sorry.

47:36.286 --> 47:37.987
- Hey, hey.

47:37.989 --> 47:40.189
We're not just getting by.

47:42.492 --> 47:45.361
We have more left
than you think.

47:48.165 --> 47:49.298
- Okay.

49:32.002 --> 49:33.636
- You seen her?

49:33.638 --> 49:34.638
- Nah-uh.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.712
When are we leaving?

49:42.714 --> 49:43.714
- Soon.

49:46.550 --> 49:49.652
- You always say we have
to keep moving.

49:49.654 --> 49:51.454
Those who stay, die.

49:52.622 --> 49:55.458
- We'll keep going,
just not yet.

49:57.094 --> 49:59.528
- So what, we're staying
because of her?

49:59.530 --> 50:01.430
- No, we're staying because
she has access to food

50:01.432 --> 50:02.432
and water.

50:04.634 --> 50:07.103
We should be thankful, Liv.

50:07.704 --> 50:11.173
- Why does it matter if
we're leaving anyway?

50:11.175 --> 50:13.275
- Well, it does matter.

50:13.277 --> 50:14.610
She deserves it.

50:16.013 --> 50:18.047
Lord knows what she's
been through.

50:18.049 --> 50:20.047
- Yeah but we've been through...

50:20.049 --> 50:22.385
- we'll, we've all been
through shit, Liv.

50:24.154 --> 50:27.156
But at least you and I
had each other.

50:27.158 --> 50:29.225
She didn't have anybody.

50:49.146 --> 50:52.548
Shit.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.350
- Here.

50:54.352 --> 50:55.350
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

50:55.352 --> 50:56.619
- Let me see.
- No, it's fine.

50:56.621 --> 50:58.354
- Let me see.

51:07.464 --> 51:10.533
Why do you still wear it?

51:11.601 --> 51:13.202
- Habit, I guess.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.286
- I use to love that show.

51:31.521 --> 51:35.724
- My daughter
loved the colorful ones.

51:35.726 --> 51:39.128
What happened to them?

51:39.130 --> 51:40.729
Your family, I mean.

51:41.631 --> 51:45.501
- Same thing that happened
to everyone elses.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.394
- You're rationing.

52:45.396 --> 52:46.396
- Yeah.

52:47.631 --> 52:49.632
Can't always find food
on the road.

52:49.634 --> 52:50.766
- You're leaving, then.

52:50.768 --> 52:51.901
- Yeah, soon.

52:54.771 --> 52:55.771
- You can take more if...

52:55.773 --> 52:57.573
- nah, nah, please.

52:57.575 --> 52:58.941
The more food we take, the
more you have to go down there

52:58.943 --> 53:00.276
and get some.

53:03.813 --> 53:06.615
Hey, why don't you come with us?

53:07.484 --> 53:08.484
Why not?

53:09.619 --> 53:10.686
- How do you know
if what's out there

53:10.688 --> 53:13.255
is any better than what's here?

53:13.257 --> 53:14.755
- I guess we don't really.

53:14.757 --> 53:18.194
But, I mean, this place can only
be paradise for so long.

53:18.196 --> 53:19.929
- It's not a paradise.

53:22.666 --> 53:27.670
You've got Liv so you need
to find a place to survive.

53:27.672 --> 53:29.471
For you, it's north.

53:30.674 --> 53:32.341
For me, it's here.

54:46.416 --> 54:48.784
- Hey, what would you give me
if I hit that tree right there?

54:48.786 --> 54:50.784
What are you, like five?

54:50.786 --> 54:53.322
- I am 12, thank you very much.

54:53.324 --> 54:54.356
Seriously, what are you gonna
give me?

54:54.358 --> 54:56.292
That tree right there.

54:57.794 --> 54:58.794
- Um.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.332
I'll cook you dinner.

55:04.834 --> 55:06.435
- Dinner, really?

55:07.470 --> 55:09.571
You cook us dinner every night.

55:09.573 --> 55:11.907
Plus that tree's 50 yards away.

55:11.909 --> 55:12.908
- 50 yards?

55:12.910 --> 55:14.310
- Uh 30, tops.

55:15.578 --> 55:16.812
- Alright, fine.

55:16.814 --> 55:19.748
Still, what are you
gonna give me?

55:26.489 --> 55:27.489
- Fine.

55:30.627 --> 55:31.960
We won't ration.

55:33.797 --> 55:34.663
- My god, you have to.

55:34.665 --> 55:35.931
You have to!

55:35.933 --> 55:37.800
- So from here, is this okay?

55:37.802 --> 55:40.836
- Yeah and you have to
make precisely that,

55:40.838 --> 55:43.572
you see that little hole
at the bottom there?

55:43.574 --> 55:44.606
- The one right in the middle.

55:44.608 --> 55:45.541
- Yeah.

55:45.543 --> 55:46.875
That.

55:46.877 --> 55:47.877
- Alright.

55:49.112 --> 55:52.348
What are you gonna give me?

55:52.350 --> 55:54.783
- The dinner thing.

55:54.785 --> 55:57.019
- You can't have that
thing, that's Ann's thing.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.555
- Yeah but we get to eat more
than four fucking crackers.

55:59.557 --> 56:02.791
- Alright, fine then,
but what are you gonna give me?

56:02.793 --> 56:03.793
Come on.

56:05.462 --> 56:06.662
- We can swim.

56:08.698 --> 56:09.565
- Really?

56:09.567 --> 56:10.899
- Yeah.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.603
- You hate swimming.

56:14.605 --> 56:15.904
- You hate swimming?

56:15.906 --> 56:17.439
- Just in lakes.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.877
I don't like not seeing
the bottom.

56:21.879 --> 56:22.879
- Alright.

56:24.114 --> 56:27.516
This right here, it's for all
the marbles.

56:27.518 --> 56:28.650
- Okay, come one.

56:28.652 --> 56:31.387
- Big ol' dinner and swim time.

56:31.389 --> 56:32.389
Alright? Here we go.

56:35.125 --> 56:37.659
Oh wait, no, no, I slipped.
- Oh, nope, nope.

56:37.661 --> 56:38.659
That was a false start.

56:38.661 --> 56:40.662
Give me one more shot,
I get a second shot.

56:40.664 --> 56:41.797
Come on, now.

56:45.002 --> 56:49.405
- Oh my god,
something just touched my foot.

56:50.974 --> 56:52.107
Did it again.

56:53.743 --> 56:54.877
- What?

56:56.146 --> 56:58.614
- Nothing.

56:58.616 --> 57:00.749
- It's not nothing.

57:01.885 --> 57:03.886
- It's nothing.

57:08.191 --> 57:09.858
Yeah, it's nothing.

57:17.500 --> 57:18.567
Oops, sorry.

57:22.806 --> 57:24.006
See you later.

57:31.981 --> 57:33.461
Mmm. Never thought I'd miss
this shit.

57:41.991 --> 57:44.860
Oh, you want me to make you one?

57:45.695 --> 57:46.695
I'm really good.

57:49.800 --> 57:50.800
Let me try.

57:53.471 --> 57:54.536
There we go.

57:56.473 --> 57:57.539
Little beet.

57:59.810 --> 58:00.943
Little olive.

58:01.878 --> 58:03.011
There you go.

58:12.655 --> 58:14.056
It's good, right?

58:15.625 --> 58:16.492
Need more cheese, though?

58:16.494 --> 58:18.694
Here.

58:18.696 --> 58:19.696
Come on.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.200
Want some cheese, Liv?

58:45.088 --> 58:46.955
- She looks like mom.

58:49.626 --> 58:51.760
I mean, not the hair but.

58:54.130 --> 58:57.132
She's good at this stuff,
you know?

58:58.234 --> 59:02.237
I mean, if it was me,
I would just be like, ah!

59:07.243 --> 59:10.846
Is that why you want her
to come with us?

59:14.150 --> 59:18.220
I mean, 'cause she's good
at this kind of thing?

59:19.255 --> 59:23.659
- Now, where would we be if
she didn't find us that day?

59:24.327 --> 59:27.696
I'd be dead and you'd be alone.

59:27.698 --> 59:29.565
Nobody deserves that.

59:30.266 --> 59:31.867
Not you, not her.

59:36.339 --> 59:40.008
I want her to come
because of you.

59:40.010 --> 59:42.945
Because she takes good
care of us.

59:45.915 --> 59:49.117
Because I wanna take care
of her, too.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.172
- Can I try that on?

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.811
- Sure.

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:25.954
- How did he ask you?

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.990
- Well.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:36.131
I found out I was pregnant
on a Friday.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.701
It was late and I told him.

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.939
And he just looked at me
and he left.

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:53.415
At midnight, he came
back, smelling like liquor

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:56.718
and he just sat down
at the edge of the bed

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.387
and showed me a ring.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:03.325
He didn't asked me,
but I said yes.

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:07.095
And then we went to bed.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:13.035
I think it came from a pawnshop.

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.439
Part of me didn't care.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.878
Somehow I knew that was the
only way it would happen.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.251
- Chris took my mom to Maui.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:35.257
He asked her on the beach
during a sunset.

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:38.860
She said it was the best day
of her life.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.865
It's nice.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.867
- It is.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.372
Sorta weird to think it was
someone else's

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.174
before it was yours.

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.248
- Yes.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.216
Okay.

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.084
I'll be back.

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:17.953
Mama loves you, okay?

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:23.959
Alright, you know that?

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:26.361
You know how much I love you?

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.235
Bye, baby girl.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.203
Bye, sweetness.

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:39.008
Okay.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:45.827
Shh, mama's here.

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:49.197
I'm so sorry I left you.

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:51.633
I'm so sorry.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:53.268
I'm so sorry.

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:53.627
- Y'know, I don't
know anything about you

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.497
other than the fact that
you're stubborn.

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:57.165
- I'm not stubborn.

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:58.165
- Aha!

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.902
Only stubborn people
instantly deny being stubborn.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.370
- It's called entrapment.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:03.872
- Maybe.

01:09:03.874 --> 01:09:06.272
But now we know beyond a shadow
of a doubt

01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:09.911
that you, Ann, whatever
the hell your last name is,

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.179
is stubborn.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.816
- You're good at that.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:16.283
- What exactly?

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:20.488
- Making me forget why I'm here.

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.367
Goodnight, Chris.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.771
- Goodnight.

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.529
Come with us.

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:42.563
- We've talked about this.

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:45.900
- Things can change.

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:48.890
Annabelle rose Marshall.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.028
Organ donor.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:56.731
Good for you.

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:06.741
- Stay.

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.045
Stay right here.

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:12.047
Stay.

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.050
- No. We can't.

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:24.025
Those that stay put, die here.

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:25.693
- Well, I'm alive.

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:31.499
- Yeah, but look what
happened to your family.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.072
Ann, I didn't mean it.

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.989
Ann, I'm so sorry, I didn't...

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.224
- she must've taken some.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:32.927
I mean, there was at
least a box of crackers...

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.231
- Oh fuck! Olivia!

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:38.199
- Chris!

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.668
Chris, wait!

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.603
- Olivia!

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:49.810
- Liv, where are you?

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:52.681
Olivia!

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:08.956
- Did you get any in your mouth?

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.359
Liv?

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:13.327
- No.

01:17:13.329 --> 01:17:14.662
- You?

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:17.198
- No, I don't think so.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.934
- You would've tasted it.

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:28.409
- That thing that came up here.

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:30.044
- They didn't.

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:32.647
Food must be scarce.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:34.649
- You still wanna stay.

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:41.856
We're leaving in the morning.

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:46.260
- How are you, pretty girl?

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.996
What do you see?

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.098
What do you see?

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.101
Yes, you like being
with your mama?

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:03.811
Yes, yes, here we go.

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:18.159
Oh, Hailey.

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:19.894
Come here, my love.

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.096
Here we go, here we go.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.384
I'm so sorry.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.353
I'm so sorry.

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:02.136
Chris.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:03.337
Chris, stop.

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:04.505
- Why won't you come with us?

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:05.840
- Because,

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:07.174
I'm, I'm not ready.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.376
- You're gonna fucking die here!

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:12.780
- Well, maybe I deserve
to fucking die here.

01:19:12.782 --> 01:19:14.915
- Oh, so that's what this is.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.384
This is some sorta punishment.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.887
Fucking atone for whatever
it is you did

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:21.255
and move on, already.

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:23.157
- This isn't a world
where you can just forgive

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:24.225
and move on.

01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:28.262
We use to be able to fuck
up and then say you're sorry

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.966
and feel better until the
next time you fuck up.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:35.035
With my daughter, there was
no next time.

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:37.905
So who can I apologize to?

01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:39.273
Huh, Chris?

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.075
There's no one here.

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:43.944
- Yeah well, my wife,

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.514
she isn't here either.

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:51.318
I fucking killed her in
front of her daughter.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.321
And it doesn't matter if
she was one of them or not,

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:55.856
I confronted it.

01:19:55.858 --> 01:20:01.128
And I don't blame me, I don't
blame her, I blame them.

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:06.267
The only world that won't
right itself, Ann, is your own.

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:12.973
And the reason for that
is because of you.

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:17.144
Not because of what happened
here or what's north, you.

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:23.217
Look, your family, they
aren't here anymore,

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.887
but you are.

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:34.195
So please, just tell yourself
you're sorry, accept it

01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:36.864
and move the fuck on, already.

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.908
- We're gonna need more food.

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:25.379
And I won't be able
to get it by myself.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.048
- You just tell me what to do.

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.252
- I'm coming, too.

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:32.119
- Liv, no your not.

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:33.954
- I'm coming!

01:21:33.956 --> 01:21:38.626
I'm just the same as Ann
or anyone else, I can help.

01:21:38.628 --> 01:21:42.096
Three carrying food is better
than two.

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.934
- Fine.

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:50.404
- Chris will distract them.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:54.108
All you and I will do
is fill our packs

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:55.042
with everything you can.

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:57.111
Just food, nothing else.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.414
And then we run.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:05.152
First sign of them, you
run, don't worry about me.

01:22:05.154 --> 01:22:06.154
Okay, Liv?

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.326
Liv, you okay?

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.262
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.098
- Okay.

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:39.553
Hey.

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.690
Look, we're all gonna be fine.

01:22:42.692 --> 01:22:44.959
Chris, Chris is gonna be fine.

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:45.961
- I know.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:49.296
I know he's gonna be fine.

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:32.339
That's us. Let's go.

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:19.620
Grab any food you can find.

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:28.328
Liv, we gotta be quick!

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.744
Just grab any food you can.

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:04.264
Olivia, what the hell?

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.266
We gotta go.

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:49.743
What are you...

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:53.247
We have to, we have to...

01:25:53.249 --> 01:25:54.314
We have to...

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:58.852
- Thought it would bleed more.

01:26:04.627 --> 01:26:05.759
- No!

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:06.761
Don't!

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:45.618
- Liv!

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.354
What's wrong?
- They're after me,

01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:48.021
- where's Ann?

01:28:48.023 --> 01:28:48.889
No, they're not.

01:28:48.891 --> 01:28:49.756
I lost them.

01:28:49.758 --> 01:28:51.425
Where's Ann?

01:28:51.427 --> 01:28:52.092
- She...

01:28:52.094 --> 01:28:53.560
- where's Ann?

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:54.562
- She's...

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:01.035
- Oh fuck!

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:07.808
Get in the car.

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:11.912
- Chris, I...
- Get in the fucking car!

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:28.729
- Olivia!

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.752
- Okay.
