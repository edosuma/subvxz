FREEMAN:
Captain's log, stardate 58105.1.

00:08.146 --> 00:10.061
The Pakleds continue
their unprovoked attacks

00:10.105 --> 00:11.715
on Federation trade routes.

00:11.758 --> 00:13.543
Seeking a cease-fire,

00:13.586 --> 00:15.980
is on a diplomatic mission
to the Pakled homeworld,

00:16.024 --> 00:18.374
which they call Pakled Planet.

00:18.417 --> 00:21.116
Starfleet Command entrusted me
with this mission

00:21.159 --> 00:24.597
because of our experience
with the Pakleds last year.

00:24.641 --> 00:28.253
Negotiating a cease-fire
would be a huge achievement.

00:28.297 --> 00:31.082
If you keep doing Picard-level
peace-brokering like this,

00:31.126 --> 00:32.736
they might give you
an Enterprise.

00:32.779 --> 00:34.607
[chuckles]:
Well, I don't know about that.

00:34.651 --> 00:36.870
Remember, it's just the Pakleds.

00:36.914 --> 00:38.959
This shouldn't be
too complicated.

00:42.267 --> 00:44.182
Ambassador Grubdin.

00:44.226 --> 00:46.141
Welcome, Captain Janeway.

00:46.184 --> 00:49.492
Pakled Planet is big and strong.

00:49.535 --> 00:53.017
Right. Well, I'm actually
Captain Freeman of the Cerritos.

00:53.061 --> 00:55.063
I'm here to discuss
a cease-fire.

00:55.106 --> 00:56.629
Oh, I was misinformed.

00:56.673 --> 00:58.805
I do not have
a big enough helmet

00:58.849 --> 01:00.503
to make cease-fires.

01:00.546 --> 01:03.854
Okay. Well, then I need to talk
to someone with a bigger helmet.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.291

-Stay back.

01:08.163 --> 01:09.555

01:09.599 --> 01:11.731
Guys, the prisoner Rumdar.

01:11.775 --> 01:14.560
He ran away from Pakled Planet
to her ship.

01:14.604 --> 01:17.781
You! Why did you steal Rumdar?

01:17.824 --> 01:20.000
[chuckles] I can assure you,
we did no such thing.

01:20.044 --> 01:22.568
Ransom,
is there a Pakled on my ship?

01:22.612 --> 01:24.048
-That's an affirmative, Captain.
-[thudding]

01:24.092 --> 01:26.572
This ship is strong.
I can live here now.

01:26.616 --> 01:29.053
-We think
he's requesting asylum.
-GRUBDIN: No!

01:29.097 --> 01:31.186
Until she gives Rumdar back,

01:31.229 --> 01:33.840
Janeway stays here!

-Uh, yeah.

02:53.311 --> 02:55.618

the same thing.

Oh, no,

-Oh, yes!
-RUTHERFORD: Ugh.

03:02.712 --> 03:04.322
-I got it, too.
-So did I.

03:04.366 --> 03:07.238
-What's anomaly consolidation?
-You get to go around the ship

03:07.282 --> 03:08.935
and collect the bridge crew's
research materials

03:08.979 --> 03:10.937
-from their missions.
-It's trash day.

03:10.981 --> 03:13.113
It's our bosses, who have
accumulated all sorts of stuff,

03:13.157 --> 03:15.812
saying, "Hey, peons,
come pick up our trash."

03:15.855 --> 03:18.162

03:19.816 --> 03:21.600
We have to pack it up

03:21.644 --> 03:23.646
Could be a nice break
from our usual duties.

03:23.689 --> 03:24.777
Maybe it'll be fun.

03:24.821 --> 03:26.518
Oh, sweet, sweet Tendi, no.

03:26.562 --> 03:29.434
ACD is the most degrading day
of the year.

03:29.478 --> 03:31.262
Don't listen to her.
This is gonna be great.

that you made.

We're all having so much fun.

-At my expense.
-[Mariner chuckles]

03:45.755 --> 03:48.236
Hey. Boimler, right?

03:48.279 --> 03:50.150
Heard a lot of buzz
about your time on the Titan.

03:50.194 --> 03:52.109
[chuckles]:
Oh, uh, Ensign Casey. Hi.

03:52.152 --> 03:54.590
-You guys heard about that?
-You're a legend. Listen,

03:54.633 --> 03:56.896
we've got this little club where
we help each other rank up,

we're down a member.

One day we'll all be captains.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.953
You call yourselves Redshirts?

04:09.996 --> 04:12.564
Cool name, right?
Makes us sound invincible.

04:12.608 --> 04:14.174
But why would you want me
to be one? I mean, I got

04:14.218 --> 04:16.307
the red shirt, but is there,
like, a form I need to fill out?

04:16.351 --> 04:17.787
You served with Riker.

04:17.830 --> 04:19.789
That kind of experience
is super valuable.

04:19.832 --> 04:21.791
Listen, there's gonna be
an acting captain's duty

04:21.834 --> 04:24.402
up for grabs later today.
Only us Redshirts know about it.

[gasps] Acting captain?
Like, l-like on the bridge?

04:26.796 --> 04:28.537
You tell us Riker stuff today,

I'll get you in the running
for the big chair.

04:30.321 --> 04:32.018
But... [sighs]
I have ACD.

-We'll pull some strings,
get you out of it.
-Uh...

-I don't know.
-CASEY: It's awesome
that you served

on the Titan,
but there has to be a reason

04:40.766 --> 04:42.072
you're back on the Cerritos.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.161
You don't carry yourself
like a leader.

04:44.204 --> 04:45.597
We could help you with that.

Unbelievable.
Boimler's cozying up

04:58.480 --> 05:00.917
with those brownnosers
to get out of trash day?

05:00.960 --> 05:03.702
-Such a great call.
-More trash for the rest of us.

-I smell adventure.

Religious persecution?
Leading a rebellion?

05:10.883 --> 05:12.320
Some sort of sex stuff?

05:12.363 --> 05:14.626
I want to see
how the shields work.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.500
You want to see our
top secret defensive schematics?

05:18.543 --> 05:21.067
Yeah, and your crimson
force field, too.

05:21.111 --> 05:23.983
Uh, I will see
if it's operational.

anything, has he?

-Hmm, this could work
to our advantage.
-Oh. Ah!

Maybe he'll reveal something
about the attacks.

-On it.

stuff like this in a lab.

You can tell
from the occipital bone

06:08.985 --> 06:10.769
that this was one big froggy.

kind of disruptive.

top secret Starfleet gift shop.

uh, high-security juice bar?

Sure, sure.
We'll get you there, big guy.

with the Tal Shiar here.

to tell us about their systems.

-COMPUTER: No Pakled detected.
-What?

07:19.838 --> 07:22.058
Did he leave the ship?
Did he somehow cloak himself?

-Unknown.
-Zinda, his eyes red.

07:24.016 --> 07:25.191
I'll check engineering.

in the bathroom.

But he said that you
should negotiate a cease-fire.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.579
Oh, I don't have
a big enough helmet to do that.

Boimler,

08:53.628 --> 08:55.020
you need to look like a leader

08:55.064 --> 08:56.587
if you want people
to treat you like one.

08:56.631 --> 08:58.589
First,
you've got to fix this posture.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.025
You're like this

09:00.069 --> 09:03.072
when you need to be like this.

-[back cracks]
-[groans] Oh, wow.

my spine went that far.

-That's new.
-Now, this outfit? Oof.

09:09.557 --> 09:11.080
This is not a good look.

09:11.123 --> 09:13.604
We all wear this.
It's a uniform.

09:13.648 --> 09:16.259
-The captain literally wears
the same thing, and she's...
-Right now

09:16.302 --> 09:17.608
this uniform is wearing you.

09:17.652 --> 09:19.436
Easy to fix
with a few modifications.

09:19.479 --> 09:22.221
-Ooh, did Riker
modify his uniform?
-What? No.

09:22.265 --> 09:23.919
I mean, I guess they had to put
a lot of extra room

09:23.962 --> 09:25.660
in his pants.
For his legs, I mean.

09:25.703 --> 09:27.226
'Cause he's tall.
You know what they say:

09:27.270 --> 09:28.837
-tall guy, big legs.
-Oh, my God, your hair.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.490
Wow, I didn't even take in
the hair.

09:30.534 --> 09:33.102
I like my hair.
I'm a cutie. This is good hair.

09:33.145 --> 09:35.234
But would you follow it
into battle?

09:35.278 --> 09:39.064
[sighs]
Maybe just a trim?

09:39.108 --> 09:41.153

Oh, I feel amazing.

09:47.986 --> 09:49.771
Oh, look at these shoulders!
Damn.

09:49.814 --> 09:52.295
Starfleet royalty.

09:52.338 --> 09:54.950
-[Mariner groans]
-Oh! Aw.
-Aah!

09:54.993 --> 09:56.734
Boimler? [gasps]
You look amazing.

09:56.778 --> 09:58.780
[chuckles]: Thank you. The
Redshirts gave me a makeover.

09:58.823 --> 10:00.520
I-I might have a shot
at acting captain.

10:00.564 --> 10:03.175
[gasps] Whoa,
is that a Retroovian flask?

10:03.219 --> 10:04.699
Uh, you know it.

10:04.742 --> 10:06.222
Careful. Those can release
a gelatinous spray

10:06.265 --> 10:07.440
-that traps you in this...
-MARINER: Yeah.

10:07.484 --> 10:09.747
-We know.
-[Casey clears throat]

10:12.054 --> 10:13.403
Oh, uh, got to go.
But I want to hear

10:13.446 --> 10:14.709
everything later.
Watch out for that spray.

10:14.752 --> 10:17.363
-It'll mess you up.
-Damn it, the Nanobots.

10:17.407 --> 10:18.887
Billups can calculate
warp variance,

10:18.930 --> 10:21.150
but he can't remember to tighten
the lid on a jar.

10:21.193 --> 10:24.109
Aw, but come on. How often
do we get to be face-to-face

10:24.153 --> 10:25.807
with these tiny terrors?

10:25.850 --> 10:28.548
Bright side: they're not
full-sized robots, right? Right?

10:28.592 --> 10:30.725
[groans] Tendi, this stuff
is eating my fingerprints.

10:30.768 --> 10:34.076
There's no bright side!
Stop trying to make this fun.

10:34.119 --> 10:35.730
-But...
-What is your deal, okay?

10:35.773 --> 10:39.211
Every day isn't gonna be some
pristine, exploratory adventure.

10:39.255 --> 10:40.909
Sometimes it's work,
and it sucks.

10:40.952 --> 10:42.040
Get used to it!

10:42.084 --> 10:44.260
Okay. Sorry.

10:44.303 --> 10:45.957
Where could he be?

10:46.001 --> 10:48.046
He's giant and brown.

10:49.004 --> 10:51.571
Being captain
is the role of a lifetime.

10:51.615 --> 10:54.444
Leader. Fighter.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.793
Lover.

10:55.837 --> 10:57.403
The captain needs
to always be prepared

10:57.447 --> 11:00.102
to give a rousing speech,
so go ahead.

11:00.145 --> 11:01.712
[rolls "R"]:
Rouse them.

11:01.756 --> 11:04.193
Uh, what am I
supposed to speech about?

11:04.236 --> 11:05.324
Ooh! A temporal rift.

11:05.368 --> 11:06.674
Oh, oh! With a plasma grid.

11:06.717 --> 11:08.240
And the replicators are broken.

11:08.284 --> 11:11.548
Sounds like a crew
that could use some inspiration.

11:11.591 --> 11:13.028
Right now?

11:13.071 --> 11:14.464
Okay. Uh...
[clears throat]

11:14.507 --> 11:16.771
Um, attention, crew. Um,

11:16.814 --> 11:19.208
I'm your captain.
I'm Captain Boimler.

11:19.251 --> 11:22.037
Uh, we've got a plasma grid
and a temporal rift.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.692
Sorry,
you said "temporal rift," right?

11:24.735 --> 11:26.432
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:26.476 --> 11:29.871
And, uh, lots of danger.
But as sure as, uh,

11:29.914 --> 11:33.178
this is my captain's chair, um,

11:33.222 --> 11:34.876
you can count on me

11:34.919 --> 11:36.529
'cause I'm your captain.

11:36.573 --> 11:38.270
Yes, sirree.

11:39.271 --> 11:40.751
We should mutiny.

11:40.795 --> 11:42.579
Sorry, sorry, no, no, no.
I know that wasn't good.

11:42.622 --> 11:45.756
It's just this isn't the same
as actually being on the bridge.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.280
The bridge is wherever you are.

11:48.324 --> 11:50.195
Close your eyes,
think about Riker,

11:50.239 --> 11:53.024
and say what he would say.
From the heart.

11:53.068 --> 11:55.157
-Hisheart.
-[exhales]

11:55.200 --> 11:57.899
Look, I may not know
exactly what we're up against,

11:57.942 --> 12:00.815
but I do know that in this,
our darkest hour,

12:00.858 --> 12:02.338
I'm grateful.

12:02.381 --> 12:06.211
Grateful to have a ship
and a crew I trust with my life.

12:06.255 --> 12:08.039
Now, I'll be honest.
There's no guarantee

12:08.083 --> 12:10.346
we're gonna get out of this.
But if we do, it'll be

12:10.389 --> 12:13.218
because of your combined talent
and dedication.

12:13.262 --> 12:15.873
It's been the honor of my life
to serve as your captain.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.527
But we're not dead yet,

12:17.570 --> 12:20.182
so how about we go in
and kick some ass.

12:20.225 --> 12:22.445
Red alert! Take us in.

12:22.488 --> 12:25.274
-[applause]
-CASEY: Now,

12:25.317 --> 12:26.884
thatsounds like a captain.

12:29.844 --> 12:32.585
Wow, even Dr. Migleemo
has stuff?

12:32.629 --> 12:33.804
I didn't know
he even went on missions.

12:33.848 --> 12:35.240
That's a pile of random junk.

12:35.284 --> 12:36.981
-Come on.
Even you have to admit that.
-No.

12:37.025 --> 12:39.375
And honestly, I'm getting tired
of you guys whining all day.

12:39.418 --> 12:41.551
If you're so over
anomaly collection,

12:41.594 --> 12:43.074
then I'll just do it myself.

12:43.118 --> 12:44.510
-Okay. Works for me.
-Oh, great idea.

12:44.554 --> 12:45.816
[Mariner and Rutherford sigh]

12:45.860 --> 12:47.339
[groans]

12:47.383 --> 12:49.820
Okay, let's see. There's
this dusty goggles thing.

12:49.864 --> 12:52.083
Ooh, half of some sort of sword.

12:52.127 --> 12:54.477
-You guys
are really missing out!
-MARINER: Mm-hmm.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.392
[sighs]
Look, he's throwing out

12:56.435 --> 12:58.437
a perfectly good storybook.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.963
[squealing]

13:02.006 --> 13:03.486
[whimpers]

13:04.487 --> 13:06.141
Oh, it's one
of those energy field books

13:06.184 --> 13:07.229
that makes stories come to life.

13:07.272 --> 13:08.578
[grunts]
Come here!

13:08.621 --> 13:11.233
Get back in this book!
[grunting]

13:12.234 --> 13:13.235
-[screams]
-Oh!

13:13.278 --> 13:15.324
[sighs]
Huh?

13:15.367 --> 13:17.805
-Oh, no.
-[shrieks]

13:17.848 --> 13:19.241
-Uh...
-Crap, crap, crap!
-Slug!

13:19.284 --> 13:21.765
-[shrieks]
-No!

13:21.809 --> 13:24.594
-Tendi!
-Ugh! Okay, we just got to find
the right hypospray.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.900
-[muffled screaming]
-Uh, hang tight, Tendi!

13:25.943 --> 13:27.902
Don't get digested!

13:27.945 --> 13:30.948
-Uh, uh... Ha!
-[shrieking]

13:31.993 --> 13:35.126
[muffled grunting]

13:35.170 --> 13:37.085
[panting]

13:37.128 --> 13:39.130
-Ugh. [grunts]
-[shrieks]

13:42.046 --> 13:43.961
-Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?
-D'Vana?

13:44.005 --> 13:47.269
[whimpers, coughs]
You were right.

13:47.312 --> 13:50.750
Anomaly consolidation day
isthe worst.

13:50.794 --> 13:52.796
Hey, we've all...
I mean, who among us

13:52.840 --> 13:54.972
hasn't been pooped out
by an alien creature?

13:55.016 --> 13:56.844
-It is not a...
-Don't touch me!

13:58.933 --> 14:01.326
Captain, this is going sideways.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.241
I recommend we beam out now.

14:03.285 --> 14:04.808
No. We have to make this work,

14:04.852 --> 14:07.463
or it'll turn into a big, brown,
Pakled smear on my record.

14:07.506 --> 14:09.944
[fanfare playing]

14:09.987 --> 14:11.902
I am King Pakled.

14:11.946 --> 14:14.992
-Finally. It is an honor
to meet you, sir.
-[door opens]

14:16.080 --> 14:19.605
I am emperor of the Pakleds.

14:19.649 --> 14:23.087
-Okay. Well, then,
it's an honor to m...
-[Pakleds shouting]

14:25.307 --> 14:27.439
Rebelution!

14:27.483 --> 14:29.441
-[gasps]
-[overlapping shouting]

14:31.835 --> 14:35.665
-[laughs] Die!
-[screams]

14:37.493 --> 14:39.538
The big-helmeted Pakleds

14:39.582 --> 14:41.976
will no longer control us!

14:42.019 --> 14:43.542
Ooh.

14:43.586 --> 14:47.155
I am now Pakled leader.

14:47.198 --> 14:49.940
Behold my giant helmet!

14:49.984 --> 14:51.768
-He is strong.
-[Freeman groans]

14:58.557 --> 15:01.125
You know, I was
a little skeptical at first,

15:01.169 --> 15:03.475
but I really am feeling
way more captainy than usual.

15:03.519 --> 15:05.956
-Now you have to start
living like one, too.
-Oh, you mean,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.697
like sitting in a centered chair
all day or...?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.178
Nothing tells you about
a captain more than the officers

15:10.221 --> 15:11.744
they've chosen to have
at their side.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.224
That's true in your social life

15:13.268 --> 15:15.226
-as much as it is on the bridge.
-Oh. [scoffs]

15:15.270 --> 15:17.402
I've got that covered.
My friends are awesome.

15:17.446 --> 15:18.795
Look, that's them right there.

15:18.838 --> 15:20.536
-[Rutherford grunts]
-[Tendi coughs]

15:20.579 --> 15:22.930
They've been
consolidating anomalies all day.

15:22.973 --> 15:25.671
-It's pretty cool, right?
-No, not cool.

15:25.715 --> 15:27.282
Those three
are always elbow-deep

15:27.325 --> 15:28.936
in some kind of slime.

15:28.979 --> 15:30.981
Yeah, we work in Starfleet.
I mean, slime's a given.

15:31.025 --> 15:33.636
No, wework in Starfleet.

15:33.679 --> 15:35.290
-They work forStarfleet.
-[Mariner grunts]

15:35.333 --> 15:38.032
Okay, hold on. They're
the same rank as you or me.

15:38.075 --> 15:39.772
And while we've been
"playing captain" all day,

15:39.816 --> 15:41.644
they've been doing real work
to help the ship.

15:41.687 --> 15:44.038
This isn't a friendship.
It's a starship.

15:44.081 --> 15:45.126
Are you a star

15:45.169 --> 15:47.128
-or not?
-What?

15:47.171 --> 15:48.825
The bridge crew
brought in this crap,

15:48.868 --> 15:50.914
theyshould clean it up.
I'm not their mom.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.177
Uh, I don't know.
It's not that bad.

15:53.221 --> 15:55.745
It was the worst!
I hate this stupid ship.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.226
Whoa, slow to impulse:
you love the Cerritos.

15:58.269 --> 16:00.010
Ugh,
I must have sounded so stupid.

16:00.054 --> 16:01.751
I thought
we were gonna have so much fun

16:01.794 --> 16:03.057
picking up the trash.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.494
Ha!
I even volunteered us for it.

16:05.537 --> 16:07.365
-Wait, you did?
-Why?

16:07.409 --> 16:09.411
You guys were always sad that
we don't go on cool missions.

16:09.454 --> 16:10.934
[distorted]:
So Ensign Genius over here

16:10.978 --> 16:11.979
figured it would be fun

16:12.022 --> 16:13.502
to get closer to the action.

16:13.545 --> 16:15.286
But you guys were right.
It sucked!

16:15.330 --> 16:16.896
And being lower decks sucks!

16:16.940 --> 16:19.029
I wish I was still on Orion!

16:19.073 --> 16:20.552
Uh, Tendi,
that cube's kind of...

16:20.596 --> 16:22.728
Today has been
totally degrading!

16:22.772 --> 16:24.948
Uh, maybe-maybe put down
the cube before you...

16:24.992 --> 16:27.429
[Tendi grunting]

16:27.472 --> 16:28.517
[roars]

16:28.560 --> 16:29.605

16:29.648 --> 16:30.998
[Tendi grunts]

16:31.041 --> 16:32.869
-[Tendi roars]
-We got a scorpion here!

16:32.912 --> 16:34.305
What was that cube?

16:34.349 --> 16:35.698
There has to be a way
to reverse it.

16:35.741 --> 16:36.612
[Mariner and Rutherford scream]

16:36.655 --> 16:38.353
I'm getting tired of you guys

16:38.396 --> 16:40.746
whining all day!

16:40.790 --> 16:42.052
-[Ransom screams]
-[Kayshon gasps]

16:42.096 --> 16:44.272

-[roaring]
-[screaming]

16:54.586 --> 16:55.848
[screams]
Is that Tendi?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.199
We got to do something.

16:58.242 --> 17:00.592
You're right.
The crew depends on us.

17:00.636 --> 17:04.379
The Starfleet manual
defines "danger" as "a force

17:04.422 --> 17:07.121
-which causes
or tends to cause harm."
-It is in times of doubt...

17:07.164 --> 17:09.210
-[overlapping speeches]
-A ship that encounters
no rough wind

17:09.253 --> 17:11.168
is a ship
that's never sailed at all.

17:11.212 --> 17:12.952
Are any of you
actually gonna do something?

17:12.996 --> 17:15.129
We're doing it.
We're inspiring the crew.

17:15.172 --> 17:17.131
We arethe crew!

17:17.174 --> 17:19.394
[panting]
Tendi,

17:19.437 --> 17:21.222
I know you're in there.
You're gonna be okay.

17:21.265 --> 17:22.788
[roaring]

17:22.832 --> 17:24.094
[Boimler grunts]

17:24.138 --> 17:25.574
[panting]
What happened?

17:25.617 --> 17:27.054
Did she touch a mysterious orb?

17:27.097 --> 17:28.446
What? No. It was a cube.

17:28.490 --> 17:30.057
Oh! Uh, I bet it was
an Ataxian mood shifter.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.319
I've got this.

17:31.362 --> 17:33.408
[panting]
Computer, big bowl of beans,

17:33.451 --> 17:34.931
hot.

17:37.107 --> 17:39.196
Hey, Tendi. Whoa! I sure hope

17:39.240 --> 17:41.590
I don't spill these beans
on my... [screams]

17:41.633 --> 17:43.679
Aah! Aah, God.

17:43.722 --> 17:45.550
-[Tendi roaring]
-[Boimler panting]

17:45.594 --> 17:47.335
Computer,
birthday cake, lit candles,

17:47.378 --> 17:48.988
various temperatures.

17:49.032 --> 17:50.903
Wow.

17:50.947 --> 17:53.123
It sure is hard
carrying this birthday cake

17:53.167 --> 17:55.734
with all this bean slime
on my... [screams, grunts]

17:55.778 --> 17:58.259
-[laughing]
-What the hell is he doing?

17:58.302 --> 17:59.477
-[Boimler groans]
-Shut up. Look.

17:59.521 --> 18:01.131
Oh, no, and now the candles

18:01.175 --> 18:03.264
have lit my uniform on fire.
What a predicament.

18:03.307 --> 18:05.962
[screams, grunts]

18:06.005 --> 18:08.095
-[Tendi continues laughing]
-[gasps] It's working.

is weakening.

[exhales]
It really was.

18:31.466 --> 18:33.685
-[chuckles] You okay?
-Yeah.

18:33.729 --> 18:35.165
Geez,
I was really out of control.

18:35.209 --> 18:36.645
Thanks for saving me.

18:36.688 --> 18:39.735
Oh, of course.
That's what we do.

18:45.567 --> 18:48.091
Oh, no. How long were we out?

18:48.135 --> 18:49.527
Rumdar could be anywhere.

18:49.571 --> 18:51.399
We never should have
underestimated him.

18:51.442 --> 18:53.270
Shaka?

18:55.707 --> 18:58.232
Maybe we didn't
underestimate him.

I don't know how he was able to
survive in the vacuum of space,

-but he's totally fine.
-Uh, Pakleds are strong.

19:08.503 --> 19:10.940
How did you get outside
in the first place?

19:10.983 --> 19:14.161
I went to the bathroom.
When I pressed the flush button,

19:14.204 --> 19:16.728
I got shot
out of a little hatch.

19:16.772 --> 19:18.382
Are you sure
you weren't in an air lock?

19:18.426 --> 19:21.559
Can I have all your codes now?

Ah, Rumdar returns.

19:32.831 --> 19:35.443
Hi, everybody.

19:35.486 --> 19:36.879
We tricked you, Janeway.

19:36.922 --> 19:38.402
We never wanted peace.

19:38.446 --> 19:41.318
Rumdar was a spy.
[laughs]

19:41.362 --> 19:43.102
What did you learn, spy?

19:43.146 --> 19:45.931
The Enterprisehas
the biggest bathrooms ever,

19:45.975 --> 19:48.369
and she is not Captain Janeway.

19:48.412 --> 19:50.153
-She is Captain Freeman!
-[Pakleds gasp]

19:50.197 --> 19:52.590
-That's what
I've been telling you.
-[Rumdar laughs]

19:52.634 --> 19:54.636
I tricked you.

19:54.679 --> 19:57.639
And I didn't give up
any information, either.

19:57.682 --> 19:59.293
I'm a good spy.

19:59.336 --> 20:02.687
Well, yes, you are amazing.

20:02.731 --> 20:05.647
I just wish I knew
what information you kept secret

20:05.690 --> 20:08.258
so I could know
how amazing you are.

20:08.302 --> 20:11.087
I didn't tell you anything
about our big plan

20:11.130 --> 20:13.829
to smuggle a Varuvian bomb
onto Earth.

20:13.872 --> 20:15.613

20:15.657 --> 20:20.227

you truly are a master spy.

-Don't apologize.

20:44.555 --> 20:46.427
Ah, we were kind of being punks
all day.

We should have fed off
your enthusiasm,

20:49.952 --> 20:51.736
Yeah, you know what?
The best anomaly today

20:51.780 --> 20:53.303
was all your silver linings.

20:53.347 --> 20:56.045
-And that skull thing.

Sorry, you can't come with us.

That move you pulled
in the mess hall

21:12.975 --> 21:15.020
-proves you don't belong
in the Redshirts.
-Hey.

21:15.064 --> 21:17.414
-My friend was in trouble.
-You made a fool of yourself

21:17.458 --> 21:19.764
to make a bug laugh.
It was shameful.

21:19.808 --> 21:21.200
All right,
you know what's shameful?

21:21.244 --> 21:23.333
Trying to build a persona
by copying other captains.

21:23.377 --> 21:25.335
[scoffs]
You think Riker did that?

21:25.379 --> 21:27.772
You guys are wasting your time
on this Redshirt stuff.

-Be your own captains.

take a break from the Redshirts,
focus on my duties.

21:41.569 --> 21:42.700
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:42.744 --> 21:44.572
Fine. I'll try to remember you

21:44.615 --> 21:46.661
when I'm boldly going
and you're not.

21:46.704 --> 21:49.664
Sir, I'd like to nominate myself
for the acting captain position.

21:49.707 --> 21:50.926
-Huh?
-I'm the best candidate

21:50.969 --> 21:52.710
to lead the Cerritosto victory.

21:52.754 --> 21:54.495
Oh. I don't care. Sure.

Oh, my God, really? Sir,

21:56.279 --> 21:58.673
thank you.
Sir, I won't let you down.

Quick thinking
in the mess today, Mr. Boimler.

22:01.066 --> 22:02.503
You showed some real leadership.

Thank you, sir.

Hey, do you want to catch
a Winger Bingston show sometime?

22:07.508 --> 22:09.292
Now, that guy
can deliver a speech.

22:09.336 --> 22:10.511
You ever see his one-man show

22:10.554 --> 22:11.773
where he played
all of Jupiter's moons?

22:11.816 --> 22:14.515
Just got off the comms
with Starfleet.

22:14.558 --> 22:16.125
Sounds like we did a great job.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.171
-I think that deserves a drink.
-Count me in.
