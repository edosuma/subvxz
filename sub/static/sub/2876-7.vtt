WEBVTT

00:05.213 --> 00:08.382
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says...

00:08.591 --> 00:12.511
...we really were on a break.
Yes, we were.

00:12.721 --> 00:16.974
Yes, we were. Heh.
Come here, gorgeous.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.437
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.

00:21.646 --> 00:25.441
You're just a little-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got...

00:25.650 --> 00:27.609
You've got big, beautiful eyes.

00:27.819 --> 00:31.905
Yes, you do. And a...
And a big, round belly.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.576
Big baby butt.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.663
I like big butts.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.375
I like big butts and I cannot lie

00:43.543 --> 00:45.294
You other brothers can't deny

00:45.462 --> 00:47.421
When a girl walks in
With an itty-bitty waist

00:47.589 --> 00:49.465
And a round thing in your face
You get...

00:53.094 --> 00:57.431
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.517
Oh, my God. You've never
done that before, have you?

01:00.727 --> 01:04.271
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?

01:04.480 --> 01:07.232
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.361
What? What?
You wanna hear some more? Um...

01:11.780 --> 01:16.325
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

01:18.953 --> 01:21.997
I'm a terrible father. Oh.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.090
- Hey.
- Hey, listen.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.135
- What do you know about investments?
- How come?

02:16.344 --> 02:20.222
I'm starting to make good money on the
show, and I should do something with it.

02:20.431 --> 02:24.560
- What do you do with your money now?
- It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.772
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.235
- Do you have any ideas?
- Uh, this guy at work got me excited...

02:33.444 --> 02:36.613
...about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?

02:36.823 --> 02:40.450
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.706
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.207
Yeah. Right!

02:49.794 --> 02:51.920
People eat birds. Bird meat.

02:52.130 --> 02:55.591
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:

02:55.800 --> 02:58.886
"Excuse me, I'll have
a bucket of fried bird." Ha-ha-ha.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.264
Or maybe just a wing. Or a...

03:03.975 --> 03:05.184
Mm-hm.
- Ahem.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.811
You should consider something
a little less risky.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.397
I think real estate is
your best investment.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.735
The Fed just lowered the rates, and the
interest on your mortgage is deductible.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.488
That's right. I know some stuff.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.282
Real estate, huh? Hmm.

03:20.491 --> 03:23.118
Oh! And you know who's selling
a great apartment? Richard!

03:23.328 --> 03:27.206
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

03:27.749 --> 03:29.750
My dad told me.
They play golf together.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.085
Oh! Well, maybe
I'll join them sometime.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.755
I just hope the club doesn't
slip out of my hand...

03:34.964 --> 03:37.382
...and beat the mustache
off his face.

03:44.682 --> 03:48.727
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.855
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
Big step.

03:52.065 --> 03:56.860
- Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
- They'll love you. Just be yourself.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.738
They live on the Upper East Side
on Park Avenue.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.449
- Oh, yeah, she can't be herself.
- Ugh.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.702
Okay, so, all right, which dress?

04:10.208 --> 04:13.752
- You can say neither.
- Oh, God. Neither.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.755
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
It'll be fine.

04:16.964 --> 04:20.509
You are in such good hands,
and I am so good with meeting parents.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.720
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.

04:23.888 --> 04:24.930
Uh-huh.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.558
Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I can
see where Wallace gets his good looks."

04:28.768 --> 04:33.146
- You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
- Oh, he took the SATs for me.

04:33.982 --> 04:39.111
- I knew you didn't get a 1400!
- Yeah, well, duh! I mean...

04:39.320 --> 04:41.780
So now, what about with Mike's mom?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.490
Oh! Well, with the mother...

04:43.658 --> 04:46.410
...just constantly
tell her how amazing her son is.

04:46.577 --> 04:50.122
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said...

04:50.331 --> 04:52.499
...I am like the daughter
that she never had.

04:56.254 --> 05:01.633
- She said what?
- She's like the daughter she never had.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.010
Listen.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.021
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.815
I just got Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.401
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.737
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.531
You what? And I missed it...

05:24.741 --> 05:28.493
...because I was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?

05:29.120 --> 05:32.831
Yeah, and it was, uh, like, uh,
a real little person laugh too.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.375
- Oh!
- It was like, um:

05:41.966 --> 05:44.009
Only not creepy.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.385
Yeah.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.805
- What did you do to make her laugh?
- I, um...

05:49.015 --> 05:51.641
Well, I sang. Actually...

05:51.851 --> 05:54.394
...I rapped, um, heh...

05:54.604 --> 05:56.063
..."Baby Got Back."

05:58.024 --> 05:59.900
You what?

06:00.109 --> 06:03.362
You sang to our baby daughter...

06:03.571 --> 06:06.031
...a song about a guy
who likes to have sex...

06:06.240 --> 06:08.283
...with women with giant asses?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.203
You know what,
if you think about it...

06:11.412 --> 06:15.957
...it actually promotes
a healthy, uh, body image...

06:16.167 --> 06:18.502
...because even big butts...

06:18.711 --> 06:22.089
...or, uh, "juicy doubles" are...
- Oh.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.221
Please don't take her away from me.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.188
Oh, hi, come on in.
I'm Catherine, the listing agent.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.898
Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.819
So how come Richard's selling
the place? Went bankrupt?

06:44.028 --> 06:47.781
Medical malpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?

06:48.741 --> 06:52.411
He's buying a much bigger place.
It's got a great view of Central Park...

06:52.620 --> 06:54.704
That's enough out of you.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.624
Uh, is there anything we should know
about the place?

06:57.834 --> 07:02.295
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.465
I think you guys would be
very happy here.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.179
- Ha. No, no, no.
- Ha-ha-ha.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.475
No, we're not together.
We're definitely not a couple.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.687
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- That's all right.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.982
Wow, you, uh, seemed
pretty insulted by that.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.818
What, I'm not good enough for you?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.946
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.076
Look at this place.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?

07:33.286 --> 07:36.872
Pretentious art.
This huge, macho couch.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.040
When we know
all he does is sit around...

07:39.250 --> 07:43.003
...crying about losing Monica
to a real man. Ha, ha.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.339
- You don't think he's here, do you?
- I don't know.

07:46.549 --> 07:51.303
It's a nice place, but I gotta say,
I don't know if I see myself living here.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.888
Well, let me see.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.023
Yeah, I can see it.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.235
Look at these videos.
I mean, who does he think he is?

08:07.445 --> 08:10.947
Magnum Force, Dirty Harry,
Cool Hand Luke.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.908
- Oh, my God.
- What?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.869
There's a tape here
with Monica's name on it.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.748
Ooh. A tape with a girl's name on it.
It's probably a sex tape.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.210
Wait a minute.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.754
This says "Monica."

08:27.006 --> 08:30.258
And this is Richard's apartment.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.553
Get there faster!

08:50.905 --> 08:52.948
Wow. You look...

08:53.574 --> 08:54.991
...like my mom.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.246
I'm wearing pantyhose.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.582
- Great! Come on in.
- Okay.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.085
- Ha-ha-ha. Hi.
- Hi.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.128
Oh. Thank you.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.547
Oh. Heh.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.925
- Oh, my God. You're rich.
- No, my parents are rich.

09:12.134 --> 09:15.595
So? They gotta die someday. Hello!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.389
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.267
Phoebe, these are my parents,
Theodore and Bitsy.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.978
Theodore, Bitsy...

09:23.813 --> 09:26.356
...what a delight.
Ha-ha-ha.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.652
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- And you.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.238
Your home is lovely.

09:33.781 --> 09:37.242
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.
It's actually three floors.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.327
Holy crap!

09:40.538 --> 09:43.915
Oh. Why don't you come
meet our friends?

09:44.125 --> 09:45.542
Try and stop me.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.044
Hey. What are you doing?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.088
Getting your parents to like me.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.716
I'm sure they will,
but you don't have to do this.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.509
I want them
to get to know Phoebe, not:

09:54.677 --> 09:55.885
"Phoebe."

09:56.095 --> 09:58.847
- You've got it.
- All right.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.849
- It's hard to stop.
- Mm.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.476
Well, come on.

10:03.686 --> 10:07.147
Phoebe, these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.317
Phoebe, come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.526
Mm-hm.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.862
- So where are you from?
- Um, okay.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.532
Well, all right.
Um, originally, I'm from upstate...

10:17.742 --> 10:20.994
...but, um, then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.622
So I moved to the city...

10:23.789 --> 10:26.833
...where, um, I lived in a burned-out
Buick LeSabre for a while.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.543
Which was okay. That was okay.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.712
Until, um, I got hepatitis, you know...

10:30.921 --> 10:34.841
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and...

10:36.218 --> 10:37.636
But I got over it.

10:37.845 --> 10:42.265
And, um, anyway, now I'm a, um,
freelance massage therapist...

10:42.433 --> 10:47.395
...um, which isn't always steady money,
but at least I don't pay taxes.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.072
So where does everyone summer?

11:04.747 --> 11:08.500
- Oh, God, this is not going well.
- No, you're doing fine. Really.

11:08.709 --> 11:12.212
- Why don't you go talk to my dad?
- Okay, okay, okay.

11:12.421 --> 11:15.006
- Still sure about me being myself?
- Absolutely.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.634
Though maybe just
a little less "pimp spit."

11:17.843 --> 11:19.010
Okay.

11:23.265 --> 11:27.519
So, Theodore, I, uh, can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.938
Oh. Well...

11:30.147 --> 11:34.859
- You must work out all the time.
- Oh, not all the time. I do the best I can.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.862
- Yeah, I bet. Look out!
- Oh! Ow.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.408
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Unh! I recently had surgery.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.660
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'll be fine.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.288
- I just should check the stitches.
- I really am sorry.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.417
How could you know? Why wouldn't
you punch me in the stomach?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.045
Um...

11:54.213 --> 11:55.922
Did you just hit my dad?

11:57.049 --> 12:01.094
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.930
But, I mean, you have met
humans before, right?

12:04.515 --> 12:06.349
Why don't you go talk to my mom?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.936
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.

12:10.146 --> 12:14.399
You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.696
Oh, Bitsy? Um, uh, listen,
I wanted to thank you again...

12:19.864 --> 12:21.114
...for having me here tonight.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.532
Well, not at all.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.286
Also, um, I just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.

12:26.495 --> 12:30.957
- Thank you. I think so too.
- It's a testament to how he was raised.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.210
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.

12:34.420 --> 12:38.840
- Is he really?
- He is so considerate of my feelings.

12:39.049 --> 12:43.428
You know, I think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.142
Excuse me?

12:49.351 --> 12:52.896
No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.731
When he gets going...

12:54.940 --> 12:59.277
...he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.407
That's... my boy.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.415
Awesome.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.923
I'm not gonna watch it.
I don't need to watch it.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.134
I mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.721
Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

13:28.057 --> 13:31.601
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Don't judge me! I'm only human!

13:32.645 --> 13:33.895
Did you take that tape?

13:34.104 --> 13:37.607
I had to! Imagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife...

13:37.817 --> 13:41.361
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?

13:41.570 --> 13:44.113
I don't know. Who am I married to?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.367
Some girl.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.910
She hot?

13:50.287 --> 13:52.997
- Yeah.
- How did she get me to settle down?

13:54.708 --> 13:55.959
All right, I'm gonna watch it.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.420
I mean, it's probably
not even what I think it is.

13:59.630 --> 14:03.216
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.218
Ha, ha. Can it?

14:06.762 --> 14:10.265
See, in my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped...

14:10.474 --> 14:13.017
...she doesn't say no to much else,
I'll tell you.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.647
- Then you have to watch it for me.
- Whoa! What?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.525
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. Please?

14:21.902 --> 14:25.196
All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!

14:31.453 --> 14:34.998
- Why am I hearing cheering?
- It's okay. It's just a football game.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.502
- It's just football?
- You were all worried for nothing.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.379
It's football! It's just football!

14:41.589 --> 14:44.924
This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed football!

14:45.134 --> 14:47.510
I think it may be customary
to get a beer!

14:49.430 --> 14:51.055
What the?

14:53.642 --> 14:56.144
- What are you doing?
- You don't wanna see what I just saw!

14:57.897 --> 14:59.606
What are you guys doing?

14:59.815 --> 15:02.775
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

15:06.322 --> 15:10.366
Okay, uh, please laugh for Mommy.
Please?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.826
Please laugh for Mommy.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.666
Not funny, huh?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.752
Well, so is it...

15:20.961 --> 15:25.173
...only offensive novelty rap?

15:25.382 --> 15:29.010
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.472
My name is Mommy

15:32.640 --> 15:34.265
And I'm here to say

15:34.433 --> 15:35.516
That all the babies are...

15:35.684 --> 15:37.393
Oh, I can't rap.

15:39.730 --> 15:44.901
All right, sweetheart. This is
only because I love you so much.

15:45.110 --> 15:49.697
And I know that you're
not gonna tell anybody.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.998
I like

16:00.084 --> 16:02.752
Big butts and I cannot lie

16:04.630 --> 16:07.465
You other brothers can't deny

16:08.425 --> 16:11.052
When a girl walks in
With an itty-bitty waist

16:11.220 --> 16:12.804
And a round thing in your face

16:14.139 --> 16:16.391
Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Ha!

16:16.600 --> 16:17.642
Oh.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.269
I like big butts and I cannot lie

16:20.479 --> 16:22.522
You other brothers can't deny

16:22.690 --> 16:25.274
Oh, Emma, you're laughing!
Oh, you are!

16:25.484 --> 16:28.653
You really do like big butts, don't you?

16:29.697 --> 16:33.700
Oh, you beautiful little weirdo.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.118
Oh.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.204
- Hey.
- Oh, you missed it! She was laughing!

16:38.414 --> 16:39.706
- Oh, it was amazing.
- Oh.

16:39.915 --> 16:43.501
It was amazing. It was the most
beautiful, beautiful sound.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.336
Oh, I know, isn't it?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.631
Oh, what did you do
to get her to laugh?

16:48.799 --> 16:52.844
Oh, you know, I just...
A couple of things I tried. Different...

16:53.012 --> 16:55.722
Just sang a little
"The ltsy-Bitsy Spider."

16:56.890 --> 16:59.600
You sang "Baby Got Back,"
didn't you?

16:59.810 --> 17:04.271
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!

17:05.523 --> 17:07.191
And then it goes back to the chorus.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.359
Smelly cat, smelly cat

17:09.528 --> 17:12.030
It's not your fault

17:12.196 --> 17:14.866
Resolve.
And that's the end of the song.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.744
I realize you hadn't asked
to hear it...

17:18.954 --> 17:22.707
...but, um, no one had spoken
in 17 minutes.

17:23.459 --> 17:28.796
Uh, Phoebe writes lots of songs. What
was that one you sang the other night?

17:29.423 --> 17:30.673
Oh, "Pervert Parade"?

17:31.759 --> 17:32.800
No.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.679
- Oh! "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?
- Stop.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.769
Oh, God. Is that veal?

17:42.978 --> 17:45.188
Mom, I thought I told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.522
Oh.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.568
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I mean, I am a vegetarian...

17:50.778 --> 17:54.405
...except for veal.
Yeah. No. Veal I love. Heh.

17:54.615 --> 17:59.243
- Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
- Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.038
But, you know, especially veal.

18:02.247 --> 18:06.334
You know, and this nice vein of fat
running through it.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.726
- Mm. Yummy.
Ha-ha-ha.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.447
So...

18:36.615 --> 18:37.990
What do you think?

18:41.870 --> 18:44.455
So you stole that tape
from Richard's apartment?

18:45.833 --> 18:48.459
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!

18:49.753 --> 18:53.172
That tape was never meant
to be seen by...

18:53.382 --> 18:56.592
Joey, I would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.179
Ha, ha, Monica, look, I don't think
you and I have any secrets anymore.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.144
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you later.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.439
Why in the world would you take
this tape? And why would you watch it?

19:10.607 --> 19:12.942
Because that's who I am. Okay?

19:13.527 --> 19:17.196
I'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.240
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...

19:19.449 --> 19:23.828
...for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.249
Is all of this about you not being able
to grow a mustache?

19:29.251 --> 19:32.253
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.173
He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.

19:35.382 --> 19:39.093
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?

19:39.303 --> 19:41.762
Don't be jealous.
You should feel bad for him.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.807
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard, he...

19:45.017 --> 19:47.185
I can grow a mustache.

19:48.395 --> 19:53.316
This is not our problem. We have
each other. That's all that matters.

19:53.817 --> 19:58.613
But I just keep picturing you rolling
around with him, with your...

19:58.822 --> 20:00.656
...cowboy boots in the air.

20:01.742 --> 20:06.537
Cowboy boots? I've never worn
cowboy boots in my whole life.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.081
Oh, good, good. Play more
because I wanna see how it ends.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.961
- That's not me!
- What?

20:15.631 --> 20:18.758
That's not you! Life is good again!

20:19.551 --> 20:22.220
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

20:22.763 --> 20:26.224
That bastard taped over me!

20:28.101 --> 20:30.311
Is that a problem?

20:30.520 --> 20:35.024
It's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!

20:37.277 --> 20:39.362
I can't imagine what he sees in her.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.490
She actually makes me miss
that pill-popping ex-wife of his.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.370
- Hello, dear.
- Hey.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.248
- What's going on?
- We were just chitchatting.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.417
- How's your friend?
- A little better.

20:53.627 --> 20:58.214
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.

20:58.423 --> 21:02.969
You remember her, Michael.
She's lovely, well-behaved and single.

21:03.178 --> 21:07.223
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, please, darling, let's be honest.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.559
You can have all the sailor fun
you want with that one.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.688
- But let's be real.
- All right, stop.

21:13.897 --> 21:18.359
All Phoebe has done is try and get you
to like her. Maybe it's not clear...

21:18.568 --> 21:19.735
...but she did her best.

21:19.945 --> 21:25.241
- She's a little different than you are.
- Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.

21:26.827 --> 21:30.371
So what? If I can
get past that, it shouldn't bother you.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.833
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that I do.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.335
If you can't even be civil
to the woman I love...

21:36.545 --> 21:39.755
- The woman you what?
- Yeah, the woman you what?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.468
The woman I love.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.349
I love you.

21:52.185 --> 21:56.731
Something I shouldn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents...

21:56.940 --> 21:59.317
...and Tom and Sue.

21:59.526 --> 22:03.321
Who are, by the way, the most sinfully
boring people I've ever met in my life.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.452
- I love you too.
- You do?

22:09.661 --> 22:11.329
Yeah. Ha, ha.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.080
How great is this?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.377
- Wanna get out of here?
- Okay.

22:18.587 --> 22:23.049
- Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.
- I had a great time.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.718
It was really top-drawer.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.428
And here's something rich.

22:27.637 --> 22:31.015
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
I threw up in the coat closet.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.434
Ta-ta!

22:38.690 --> 22:40.649
She's sweat, wet

22:40.817 --> 22:42.318
Got it going like a turbo 'Vette

22:42.486 --> 22:43.819
- So, fellas!
- Yeah?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.112
- Fellas!
- Yeah?

22:45.322 --> 22:47.406
- Has your girlfriend got the butt?
- Hell, yeah

22:47.574 --> 22:48.574
- So shake it
- Shake it

22:48.742 --> 22:49.909
- Shake it
- Shake it

22:50.118 --> 22:51.619
Shake that nasty butt

22:51.828 --> 22:52.995
Baby got back

22:53.163 --> 22:55.122
One more time from the top!

22:55.290 --> 22:58.417
I like big butts
And I cannot lie

22:58.585 --> 22:59.794
You other brothers...

23:02.756 --> 23:05.633
Rachel, please!
That is so inappropriate!
