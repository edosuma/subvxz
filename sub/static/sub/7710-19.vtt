WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.303
So Phil recruited me
to sell these cards,

00:02.336 --> 00:04.438
and now
I am recruiting you.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.307
Who is this guy again?

00:06.340 --> 00:07.675
Don't worry about Phil.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.510
He drives a Corvette.
He is doing just fine.

00:09.543 --> 00:13.347
Okay, calling cards
are the wave of the future.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.748
These things sell themselves.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.617
Who uses calling cards anymore?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.419
You know what, that's a nice
attitude, Ryan.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.621
I'm just helping you invest
in your future, my friend.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.822
It sounds like
a get-rich-quick scheme.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.557
Yes. Thank you.
You will get rich quick.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.059
We all will.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.727
Didn't you lose
a lot of money

00:26.760 --> 00:29.263
on that other investment--
the one from the email?

00:29.297 --> 00:30.731
You know what, Toby,
when the son

00:30.764 --> 00:33.067
of the deposed king of Nigeria
emails you directly

00:33.101 --> 00:34.368
asking for help, you help.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.805
His father ran the freaking
country, okay?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.773
All right.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.775
So raise your hand
if you want to get rich.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.612
All right.
No.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.580
Um, how is this not
a pyramid scheme?

00:46.614 --> 00:49.617
All right, let me explain
again.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.688
Phil has recruited me
and another guy.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.191
Now we are getting
three people each.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.360
The more people
that get involved,

00:59.393 --> 01:00.594
the more people

01:00.628 --> 01:02.463
who are investing,

01:02.496 --> 01:04.165
and the more money
we're all gonna make.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.499
It's not a pyramid scheme.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.436
It's not even a scheme,
per se, it's...

01:16.610 --> 01:19.580
I have to go make a call.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.788
Happy birthday, Michael.
Oh ho ho.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.190
What?

02:02.223 --> 02:03.457
I said happy birthday.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.559
Thank you.
That's really nice.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.396
Today is my b-day
and people around here

02:08.429 --> 02:09.830
just go crazy for it.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.665
I don't know why.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.802
Oh, fun fact. I share
my birthday with Eva Longoria.

02:14.835 --> 02:18.506
So I have a perfect
icebreaker

02:18.539 --> 02:20.708
if I ever meet Teri Hatcher.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.376
You excited?

02:22.410 --> 02:23.477
Mm-hmm.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.645
Everybody
freaking out?

02:24.678 --> 02:25.813
Mm-hmm.
Cool.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.748
Gonna be fun.
You're late.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.784
But I forgive you because
"doth it is my birthday."

02:30.818 --> 02:32.920
What's up?

02:34.722 --> 02:37.525
Oh, happy birthday.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.827
Ah, thank you, sir.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.330
Michael's birthday.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.831
It's pretty fun to watch,
actually.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.767
He gets very excited,
and then he eats a lot of cake.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.602
And then he runs around
the office.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.771
Then he has a sugar crash
in the afternoon.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.506
And then he falls asleep.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.543
And that's when we get
our work done.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.783
Did you hear anything yet?

03:02.816 --> 03:06.720
No. I'm still waiting.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.490
Yeah.
Yes.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.891
There he is,
the birthday boy.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.493
Oh, God.
Birthday hug.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.794
No, no, no. New suit.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.796
Please.
That suit is amazing.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.666
Thank you very much.
It is from Italy.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.001
Actually, no, Bulgaria.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.504
Maybe I should get one.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.773
Good luck.
One of a kind.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.908
eBay. Question.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.443
May I be in charge

03:29.477 --> 03:30.744
of the party planning
festivities?

03:30.778 --> 03:31.712
Not necessary.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.514
The party planning committee
is all over it.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.783
They've been working
24/7 all day yesterday.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.719
Excellent. On my part,
I did manage to reserve the--

03:38.752 --> 03:39.987
Don't. No. Please.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.722
Don't want to spoil it
for anybody.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.990
Spoil the surprise.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.658
Let's get the party started.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.926
Let's get
the party started.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.528
Not the way I taught you.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.434
When should we
bring out the cake?

03:53.467 --> 03:54.702
1:00 or 1:30?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.538
1:00's good.
1:30.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.041
I'm sorry.
Are we boring you?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.876
Party planning committee,
listen up.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.412
Michael would like
trick candles

04:04.445 --> 04:05.879
for his birthday cake.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.348
So make that a priority.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.516
Where do we get those?

04:08.549 --> 04:09.683
Not my problem.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.651
Here's a list of things

04:10.684 --> 04:13.521
that Michael would like
to be surprised by.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.923
Michael wants
a strippergram?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.926
Yes, but he doesn't want
to know when or whom.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.461
No.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.696
This is a closed
door meeting.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.474
Yeah.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.309
Michael, I have Jan
on the line.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.710
Oh, great. Put her through.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.045
Hello, Michael.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.747
Hey, you.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.049
I'm returning your call.
You said it was urgent.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.751
It is urgent.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.886
I just wanted to call
and wish you a happy birthday.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.421
Well, today's
not my birthday, so.

04:47.455 --> 04:51.492
Really? 'Cause I thought
we had the same birthday.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.894
Happy birthday, Michael.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.663
Thanks.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.731
Am I on camera?

04:57.765 --> 05:00.934
Nope. Totally private.

05:00.968 --> 05:05.606
You can say whatever
is in your heart.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.978
You can take a five
if you want.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.399
Somebody brought in donuts
for my birthday.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.933
Happy birthday.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.835
Thanks.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.873
Man, I'm so sorry.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.575
When do you find out?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.377
They said this afternoon.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.379
They're waiting
on a second opinion.
Oh, okay.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.515
Second opinion on what?

05:47.548 --> 05:48.916
I might have skin cancer.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.017
Oh, no.

05:50.050 --> 05:50.818
I was watching
Grey's Anatomy,

05:50.851 --> 05:52.019
and there was
a lifeguard on it.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.622
And he had
skin cancer too.
Kelly, you know what...

05:54.655 --> 05:56.424
I never really thought
about death

05:56.457 --> 05:57.725
until Princess Diana died.

05:57.758 --> 06:01.929
That was the saddest
funeral ever.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.532
That and my sister's.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.933
Who brought in donuts?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.601
Somebody got donuts
for my birthday.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.537
Happy birthday.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.071
You didn't know
it was my birthday.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.673
I guess I forgot.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.709
Well, I guess I forgot
to give you a donut.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.078
You serious?

06:27.588 --> 06:29.557
Skin cancer is treatable.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.425
Right.
It's gonna be okay.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.060
You don't know
it's going to be okay.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.828
Don't give him false hope.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.868
It's probably
nothing though.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.136
Hi. Delivery
for Michael Scott.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.805
Here we go.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.541
Okay, this is great.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.143
Thank you, my friends.
She is perfect.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.679
Uh.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.180
Dwight, may I have
your chair, please?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.516
And some singles,
if you will.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.585
All right.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.688
* Nnnn-dink

07:00.721 --> 07:01.955
Okay.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.624
Um...

07:03.657 --> 07:05.125
All right.
This has arms.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.060
Is that gonna be, uh--
Is that all right?

07:07.094 --> 07:09.763
Sure.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.765
Okay.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.702
I'm so nervous.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.704
I can sign for it.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.506
Oh, thanks.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.208
When I was seven,

07:21.241 --> 07:25.879
my mother hired a pony
and a cart

07:25.913 --> 07:28.816
to come to my house
for all the kids.

07:28.849 --> 07:32.986
And I got a really bad rash

07:33.020 --> 07:34.655
from the pony.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.824
And all the kids
got to ride the pony.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.191
And I had to go inside.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.193
And my mother was rubbing
cream on me

07:40.227 --> 07:41.929
for probably three hours.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.764
And I never came outside.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.566
And by the time I got out,

07:45.599 --> 07:46.867
the pony was already
in the truck

07:46.900 --> 07:48.035
and around the corner.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.838
So that was
my worst birthday.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.841
[Billy Joel's
For The Longest Time]

07:53.874 --> 07:59.580
*

07:59.613 --> 08:02.616
Stop it. Stop!
What is that?

08:02.650 --> 08:05.085
It's For The Longest Time
by William Joel.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.620
It's your favorite song.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.221
Yeah, when it's
on the radio.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.957
My birthday blows.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.293
Nobody even signed
my birthday poster.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.529
Apparently my mother
is the only one

08:15.563 --> 08:18.065
who cares enough
to send me anything.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.700
I probably care more
than she does.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.268
You're making it worse.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.572
I bet Luke Perry's friends

08:24.605 --> 08:26.874
don't treat him
like this.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.709
When does he hear?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.578
Sometime today.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.613
Poor Kevin.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.282
If I knew I had a week
to live,

08:35.315 --> 08:38.318
I would probably go
to Europe...

08:38.351 --> 08:40.988
and South America...

08:41.021 --> 08:43.090
and the Grand Canyon...

08:43.123 --> 08:47.094
and I would want to see
the Pacific Ocean.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.863
It would be
a pretty busy week.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.866
Uh, that's a list price
of $4.50.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.868
Unfortunately, this item
is on back order.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.306
Michael! Michael!

08:59.339 --> 09:00.708
Michael, Michael, Michael.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.042
Come here, come here,
come here.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.111
Listen up, everyone.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.279
It is 11:23 exactly.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.815
The exact moment

09:07.848 --> 09:10.651
when you emerged from your
mother's vaginal canal.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.253
So, huh?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.623
Have a seat,
please.
Oh, God.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.758
There is a tradition
that the Hebrews have

09:17.791 --> 09:19.627
of hoisting
the birthday boy

09:19.660 --> 09:21.662
up on a chair.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.597
So come over,
help me celebrate

09:23.631 --> 09:24.598
Michael's birth moment.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.899
Kevin.
No, no, no.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.167
I'll do it.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.369
Ryan, come on.
Let's do this.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.706
I feel like we should
go get Kevin something.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.876
Do you think we can sneak
out of here?

09:35.909 --> 09:38.779
Maybe, but we're going
to need somebody

09:38.812 --> 09:40.280
to create a diversion.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.249
On three
we're gonna hoist away! Ready?

09:42.282 --> 09:44.718
Happy birth moment,
Michael.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.320
Thank you.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.322
One, two, three.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.391
Whoa, whoa. All right.
All right.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.126
Watch it, please.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.261
It wasn't me.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.769
Okay, that is not
an eight-foot sub.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.936
We don't make
an eight-foot sub.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.137
This is eight one-foot subs.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.874
F.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.709
All right, what's the damage?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.844
39.60.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.716
39.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.189
60.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.891
Why tip someone for a job

10:23.924 --> 10:24.958
I'm capable of doing myself?

10:24.992 --> 10:26.660
I can deliver food.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.261
I can drive a taxi.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.331
I can and do cut
my own hair.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.667
I did, however,
tip my urologist

10:33.701 --> 10:38.839
because I am unable to pulverize
my own kidney stones.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.207
Here they come.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.408
Get in here.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.110
Come and get it.
Everybody.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.145
Birthday party subs.
My gift to you.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.046
What is this?

10:46.079 --> 10:48.215
Baloney, tomato,
and ketchup.
The best.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.017
These are all
the same.
Yes.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.985
Baloney?
I don't eat baloney.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.722
Well, then just have
the tomato and ketchup.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.889
Still good.
No.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.691
Just the bread.
It's fresh baked.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.692
No.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.164
Get whatever you want.
You can choke on it.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.899
When I was 16,

11:05.933 --> 11:08.936
I was supposed to go out
on a date

11:08.969 --> 11:13.073
with a girl named Julie.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.908
But there was another
Michael in the class

11:14.942 --> 11:18.078
that she apparently
thought the date was with.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.848
So she went out with him
on my birthday.

11:20.881 --> 11:24.852
And she got him a cake
at the restaurant.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.354
And it wasn't even
his birthday.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.723
But I heard about it
the next day in school.

11:29.757 --> 11:33.727
So that was the worst
birthday I think I ever had.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.029
So we got Kev some stuff.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.733
Um, party pack of M&Ms,
his favorite candy.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.870
A DVD of American Pie 2,
which is his favorite movie.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.371
And he lent it to Creed.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.974
So I can guarantee you
he won't get that back.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.976
69 Cup of Noodles.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.744
Which we realize
sounds crass,

11:50.778 --> 11:52.212
but it is his
favorite number.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.147
And his favorite lunch.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.119
Hey, temp, you know, uh,

11:59.152 --> 12:01.054
we still got five feet
of sandwich left.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.290
Someone ate three feet
of that thing?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.792
Hell, yeah.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.426
Save room
for ice cream cake.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.261
Thank you.
Oh, I got it.

12:08.295 --> 12:11.064
The party planner
committee.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.333
This is the most important day
of the year.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.303
I can't risk anything.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.305
Fine.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.207
What about that meeting later

12:20.240 --> 12:24.211
to discuss finances?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.046
Yes.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.916
But don't expect any cookie.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.852
But what if I'm hungry?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.888
No cookie.

12:51.571 --> 12:52.940
What?

12:52.973 --> 12:54.574
You use fabric
softener?

12:54.607 --> 12:57.444
Yeah. You don't?
No, I do.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.579
Okay.

12:59.612 --> 13:06.286
* Happy birthday dear Michael

13:06.319 --> 13:10.090
* Happy birthday

13:10.123 --> 13:13.927
* To you *

13:13.961 --> 13:16.830
Hello. Hey.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.199
Kevin.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.134
Respect the birthday,
please.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.537
No, not yet. I will.
Thanks.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.540
It was just Stacey.
Are you done?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.509
Good.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.311
Okay.
Here we go.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.479
Make a wish.
I'm gonna...

13:32.512 --> 13:33.847
blow out the candles.
Okay.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.849
Mmm.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.887
Yeah! Yay!

13:41.488 --> 13:43.356
I asked for trick candles.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.158
Pam was supposed to get them.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.028
Well, when she comes back,
we'll do it again.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.562
Hello.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.598
What about
the birthday boy?

13:51.631 --> 13:53.901
Haven't had a hug
all day.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.569
No one cares
about your birthday.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.907
Kevin's waiting to hear
if he has skin cancer.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.982
Ha, that sucks.

14:09.016 --> 14:13.153
Great.

14:13.186 --> 14:18.091
Wow, that's good timing.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.560
Sorry. That's terrible.
Terrible news.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.629
That's terrible...

14:22.662 --> 14:24.331
terrible news
for both of us.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.044
We should probably
head back.
Yeah. Okay.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.379
Oh, I dare you
to make an announcement.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.381
You dare me?
How old are you?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.483
Just quit stalling.

14:43.516 --> 14:48.956
Luke, this is your father.

14:48.989 --> 14:52.125
Come set the table
for dinner.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.962
Such a dork.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.496
Jim Halpert,

14:56.529 --> 14:58.498
price check
on fabric softener.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.967
The kind--

15:00.000 --> 15:01.301
Ma'am, please don't
touch that.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.335
That is not a toy.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.572
I'm sorry. Sorry.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.108
How old are you?

15:08.141 --> 15:10.343
I hate you.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.478
Honestly,
is there any way

15:11.511 --> 15:13.346
you can get
on your fiancee's plan?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.481
Our health plan
is--it's terrible.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.016
There you are.
Good news.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.317
Did some research.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.086
It turns out that 98%

15:19.119 --> 15:21.254
of people with skin cancer
fully recover.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.423
Still scary.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.558
Yeah. But it's not
brain cancer.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.261
And it shouldn't stop us
from having fun.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.098
You know what they say
the best medicine is.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.299
Well, the doctor said
a combination

15:32.332 --> 15:34.534
of Interferon
and Dacarbazine.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.537
And laughter also.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.407
I don't really think people
are in the laughing mood.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.409
Why are you here?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.377
I didn't even invite you
to my birthday party.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.546
I work here.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.714
"I work here."
All right.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.249
Well, you know what,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.383
since Toby doesn't speak
for everybody

15:50.417 --> 15:51.551
and I am your boss,

15:51.584 --> 15:53.320
I think you should just
go home.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.288
Take the rest
of the afternoon off.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.356
Take a sick day.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.624
If I go home now,

15:57.657 --> 15:59.392
I'll just drive myself crazy.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.460
Well, you're pretty much

16:00.493 --> 16:03.330
driving everybody else
here crazy.

16:03.363 --> 16:07.400
Crazy with worry.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.426
Where have you been?

16:33.460 --> 16:34.194
And don't say the bathroom,

16:34.227 --> 16:35.728
'cause I kicked in
all the stalls.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.197
Well, that's an invasion
of privacy.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.366
So I'm going
to tell Michael.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.567
Please don't.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.369
You owe me.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.037
Excuse me, everyone.

16:44.071 --> 16:47.274
Attention, please.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.176
Kevin,

16:49.209 --> 16:51.344
we're going to take you
to a very special place.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.812
A place
that will make you happy

16:52.845 --> 16:56.816
and a place that is far,
far away from the evil sun.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.551
Is this trip
in any way related

16:58.585 --> 17:00.620
to your birthday?

17:00.653 --> 17:04.324
How dare you, sir?
You're gross.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.093
That should not be there.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.594
I'll get someone
to take it down.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.262
No, it's all right.
It's already up.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.463
Just leave it.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.798
Where's Kevin?
Come on.

17:11.831 --> 17:15.268
Let's get our skate on.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.336
Don't be scared.
You're good.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.372
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're good.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.541
Oh, hi.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.548
Think you can let go?
No.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.118
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.252
Yeah!

17:32.285 --> 17:33.753
Is that Michael?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.423
Yeah, I've been pretty much
skating my whole life.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.591
I thought about playing
in the NHL.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.493
But you're on the road
so much.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.363
Get no time to spend
with your wife and kids.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.866
And I really want
a wife and kids.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.201
Aaaaah!

17:48.235 --> 17:51.604
Ha ha ha ha.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.307
I got it.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.809
Hey, Pam,
all the stuff with Kevin,

17:56.843 --> 17:59.312
um, it's pretty scary.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.881
And I'm thinking that next time
you're in the shower,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.316
you should
check yourself out.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.451
You know,
give yourself an exam.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.853
Those things are like
ticking time bags.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.389
All right?
Think about it.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.527
Something to think about.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.263
Just can't relax about it...
Kevin.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.765
Have you heard anything yet?

18:18.798 --> 18:20.200
No, not yet.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.468
Okay, well, Livestrong.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.802
Okay, Michael.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.337
Michael?

18:24.371 --> 18:25.805
Yeah. Carole?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.807
She sold me my condo.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.145
Hey, was this place
on the market or...

18:32.179 --> 18:34.147
No, I don't just sell
real estate.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.149
My daughter has
a skating lesson.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.784
Oh, these
all your kids?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.587
No, just the front two.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.290
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?
You want to go for a ride?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.624
Is that okay?
Sure.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.226
Cool. All right. Grab on.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.860
Here we go. You ready?

18:47.894 --> 18:51.231
Hang on tight.
All right.

18:51.264 --> 18:55.202
We are moving.
We are really moving now.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.940
Push. Good.
That's great. You got it.

19:02.875 --> 19:06.179
'Scuse me.

19:06.213 --> 19:11.684
Hello. Yeah, okay.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.620
All right.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.424
Okay, I will. Thanks.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.626
It's negative.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.829
God.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.837
We're going to beat this,
okay?

19:30.870 --> 19:34.241
We're gonna--
Come here.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.610
Well, apparently,
in the medicine community,

19:37.644 --> 19:39.346
negative means good,

19:39.379 --> 19:41.481
which makes absolutely
no sense.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.951
In the real world community,

19:44.984 --> 19:48.921
that would be chaos.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.924
This is awesome.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.594
Thanks, you guys.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.796
Okay, who's this from?

19:58.631 --> 20:02.269
Wowie. Look at that jersey.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.504
Turn it around.
Turn it around.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.639
Cool. Oh.
Show it.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.275
Great.
From Dwight.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.243
Number one!
Thank you, Dwight.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.378
That's great. Thanks.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.547
Michael,
this is from all of us.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.384
Oh, you didn't need
to do that.

20:17.417 --> 20:21.554
Night Swept.
This is really amazing.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.256
Thank you.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.592
I love it.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.860
Michael's birthday
was actually pretty cool.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.896
It was a good day.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.565
I don't know.
It was a good day.
