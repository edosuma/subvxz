WEBVTT

03:40.303 --> 03:42.555
And now, there are already three victims.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.477
How long does this vampire serial killer
plan to continue?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.523
I didn't realize

03:54.067 --> 03:59.405
that each time I casually pass by
the place I was unaware of...

04:01.366 --> 04:02.200
What's wrong?

04:02.533 --> 04:03.993
Nothing!

04:04.911 --> 04:10.166
He was hiding in the crowd,
secretly watching me.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.630
Unbelievable!

04:16.047 --> 04:18.091
It's better to instantly break up
with that kind of guy.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.593
What do you think, Tsukasa?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.722
Speaking of which, do you have
a boyfriend now, Tsukasa?

04:25.265 --> 04:28.268
I don't really mind.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.687
When will you stop saying that?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.939
Should I introduce you to someone?

04:33.147 --> 04:34.774
What do you think of Mr. Ochiai?

04:35.149 --> 04:37.485
Aren't you his favorite, Tsukasa?

04:37.902 --> 04:39.612
I don't think I'm his favorite.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.531
Also, I'm pretty sure he has a wife.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.285
Cut it out already! Tsukasa is pure!

04:45.576 --> 04:46.995
She's different from you guys.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.413
What's different?

04:48.788 --> 04:50.123
Tsukasa is the serious type.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.625
Does it look like we're not serious?

04:53.835 --> 04:55.795
And even if Tsukasa looks like this...

04:55.878 --> 04:56.713
Tsukasa!

04:57.171 --> 04:58.047
Can I sit beside you?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.925
Can I look at your notes?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.262
Sure.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.141
You're looking at Tsukasa's notes again?

05:08.850 --> 05:12.145
Her notes are complete.
They're really reliable.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.146
I agree!

05:13.354 --> 05:14.939
Let me have a look later, too.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.359
I don't really understand this part here.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.653
Let's see, over here...

05:20.945 --> 05:22.030
Mr. Ochiai is here.

05:22.405 --> 05:26.909
All right, sit down, everyone.
And stop copying Ms. Taira's notes!

05:31.581 --> 05:34.042
What are your plans now, Miwako?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.920
There are a few companies
I'm interested in, but...

05:38.254 --> 05:40.214
Job-hunting. We have to do it, don't we?

05:40.548 --> 05:44.177
No! You're smart.
Why don't you do a doctorate?

05:44.385 --> 05:45.219
Right?

05:45.636 --> 05:48.473
I wonder. I think that even if I stayed
in graduate school...

05:50.391 --> 05:55.605
I quite like doing research and studying.
I also like universities, but...

05:57.023 --> 05:59.192
Isn't it okay to take your time?

05:59.609 --> 06:00.985
That won't do.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.279
Not having a boyfriend is okay,

06:03.362 --> 06:07.784
but won't it be bad if you don't start
to seriously consider the future?

06:15.500 --> 06:16.334
Certainly,

06:17.043 --> 06:19.921
I've been passing each day
just going with the flow.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.965
Because my future is unclear,

06:23.466 --> 06:26.886
I can only try my best
at what's in front of me.

06:27.970 --> 06:32.141
How do I find out
what I really want to do?

06:34.268 --> 06:36.354
VAMPIRE MURDERER APPEARING EVERYDAY

06:36.687 --> 06:41.317
Again. Recently, I feel like
someone is watching me.

06:49.742 --> 06:53.579
The target is fleeing towards Todai
near Hakusan station on Hakusan Street!

06:53.955 --> 06:57.959
The victim is covered in blood
and her neck seems to have bite marks.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.711
Police! Stop right there!

07:00.878 --> 07:02.547
You can't escape, so stop resisting!

07:08.719 --> 07:11.139
This is an announcement
to all policemen in the area.

07:11.639 --> 07:15.309
The suspect on the run is confirmed
to be a Level 3 special case.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.061
We're handing the manhunt
over to Division 5.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.187
I repeat,

07:18.271 --> 07:21.441
we're handing the manhunt
over to Division 5.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.650
Hurry!

07:22.733 --> 07:23.776
What's his escape route?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.198
Do you know about the vampire murders?

07:29.407 --> 07:32.326
I do, but isn't it just an urban legend?

07:32.493 --> 07:34.495
There's no way,
I don't think vampires are real!

07:34.787 --> 07:35.746
Is something wrong?

07:35.997 --> 07:36.914
No, I don't think so.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.501
Really? By the way,
your volume is too high.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.462
Is it? I'm sorry.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.005
What are you watching?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.466
A special program on the vampire murders!

07:46.799 --> 07:48.801
You're watching that stuff again.

07:49.343 --> 07:52.847
But there were bite marks
found on the corpses' bodies!

07:52.930 --> 07:55.475
That's just props for specials
and weekly publications, right?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.602
I never heard that stuff on the news.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.521
Is it just my imagination?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.861
Squad F has gone ahead and blocked
the target's escape route.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.071
Sawazaki from Squad F, roger!

08:09.447 --> 08:12.909
The other offense and the doctor
are securing the suspect.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.579
Start filtering the information.
Put a gag order on all the police.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.583
Metropolitan Police Department
Aviation Team's EC135 calling for backup.

08:21.167 --> 08:25.338
Division 5 and the riot police arrived
at the suspect's escape route.

08:27.131 --> 08:27.965
Stop!

08:37.350 --> 08:40.144
This is Sawazaki. The culprit went
over there, as planned.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.521
I'm counting on you, Jill.

08:51.989 --> 08:56.827
Did you think you could escape?
This game of tag ends here.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.689
Is this the first case?

09:24.814 --> 09:25.856
Who knows?

09:26.232 --> 09:29.735
Once he's had a taste of blood,
he won't be able to forget it.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.823
Going into a trance from the mental high
and sexual pleasure,

09:34.448 --> 09:37.535
it's like a drug to him.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.998
Ten times higher than what humans
experience when they take drugs.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.249
It's hard to imagine.

09:43.499 --> 09:47.253
By nature, this species has
an addiction to human blood.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.421
Vampires.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.677
I know it's hard on you.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.179
Let me make things easier for you.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.066
Is that the suspect
behind the vampire serial killings?

10:10.067 --> 10:13.112
It's not him. It's another guy.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.675
What do you think, Tsukasa?

10:34.884 --> 10:36.761
What's the story
behind the vampire murders?

10:37.094 --> 10:39.347
Stop showing things like that to Tsukasa.

10:39.513 --> 10:42.099
Oh, Akimura, you really...

10:42.183 --> 10:43.976
What's with that face?

10:44.518 --> 10:46.020
The train will stop
at Kourakuen shortly...

10:46.103 --> 10:49.440
-Tsukasa lives far, so walk her home!
-The exit is on the right.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.317
I will. You're so annoying.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.328
Wasn't it beautiful?

11:02.495 --> 11:04.372
It was. What should we do after this?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.818
Don't worry about it, Tsukasa.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.572
About what I said the other day.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.743
I know that you don't see me that way.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.747
I'm not blaming you.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.624
I know, but...

11:48.707 --> 11:50.251
Wow, that's some face you're making.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.252
What?

12:04.682 --> 12:05.683
But,

12:06.267 --> 12:08.853
I'll like it better if you don't have
a boyfriend.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.651
If you do, I'll probably never recover.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.363
What are you saying?

12:22.032 --> 12:23.033
I'm serious.

12:32.501 --> 12:36.005
Right now, being friends is okay.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.302
But one day, if you...

12:45.014 --> 12:46.265
Oh, it's nothing.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.618
Akimura?

13:06.660 --> 13:07.870
Let's go a different way.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.872
I just feel like something is wrong.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.977
We should be fine now that we're here.

13:33.187 --> 13:36.815
There's no doubt,
that guy was on the train.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.319
Don't tell me we were being followed?

14:35.082 --> 14:35.916
I'm sorry.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.043
Let's go.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.512
Hey, vampire.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.649
Doesn't a man's blood satisfy you?

15:01.317 --> 15:02.192
Stop.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.905
What is it with you?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.991
What are you saying?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.205
I have no intention of sucking her blood.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.124
Don't get in the way.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.210
Akimura.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.547
Look, you scared her.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.885
I don't know who you are,
but your concern is not needed.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.972
I have never directed my desire
for blood towards her.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.683
Really? That craving for blood

15:34.892 --> 15:38.812
was released on other women,
and you've already killed three people.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.441
It wasn't me!

15:43.275 --> 15:47.029
Your semen was left behind
at the crime scene.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.119
It wasn't mine!
Stop saying that stuff in front of her!

15:54.203 --> 15:55.871
The DNA matched.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.249
I only followed you
because evidence was found.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.627
Get away from me.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.087
Tsukasa!

16:03.963 --> 16:05.339
Don't you dare lay a hand on her!

16:06.006 --> 16:09.134
Are you only an ally of justice
in front of the girl you like?

16:09.760 --> 16:12.680
Whether you're a demon
or a human, you're nothing.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.557
It's better to be caught here.

16:16.225 --> 16:20.312
All vampires who rape and kill
can never escape the pleasure,

16:20.479 --> 16:21.855
and will only repeat the crime.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.567
Won't you do the same thing to that girl?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.780
That won't happen.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.449
I've even been taking medication
to prevent that.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.285
I've also injected sedatives
to prepare for that.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.289
I intended on hiding it my entire life!

16:40.374 --> 16:42.876
People's lives are equal,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.630
but each person's importance isn't.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.051
There's no way to protect everyone.

16:53.595 --> 16:57.433
It's true that it's strange.
For the sake of protecting Tsukasa,

16:58.559 --> 17:00.436
why did I have to kill the other women?

17:01.103 --> 17:04.440
Should I have killed Tsukasa
instead of those women?

17:05.566 --> 17:08.485
Or would it have been better if I died?

17:10.738 --> 17:11.572
Tsukasa.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.804
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.479
Tsukasa.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.205
Can you walk?

18:46.500 --> 18:47.417
It hurts!

18:47.501 --> 18:49.253
It looks like it's hard with that leg.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.172
This is Anzai of Squad F.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.424
Target A has been secured.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.969
He's at Hongou District Four now.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.220
It's Sawazaki.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.639
Backup from Hidaka will arrive
in three minutes.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.307
I used sedatives.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.185
I'm sorry, but I have to do something.
Please take him away.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.103
What?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.814
Can't you stay there for just three--

19:23.412 --> 19:24.830
Is it okay not to go?

19:28.208 --> 19:29.209
If it's me...

19:29.459 --> 19:31.128
It's probably not.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.092
Is it here?

19:49.438 --> 19:51.607
Hey, it's 301, right?

20:01.325 --> 20:04.286
Thank you very much, Mr. Anzai.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
Forget my name.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.752
And what happened today as well.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.969
Don't cry.

20:21.428 --> 20:25.891
I'll cry if I want to!
Akimura and I were friends!

20:26.808 --> 20:28.977
Or at least that's what I thought.

20:30.562 --> 20:34.566
I didn't know anything about him.

20:35.859 --> 20:41.198
You know, vampires
are biologically similar to humans.

20:42.199 --> 20:46.954
As long as their bodies aren't abnormal,
even fellow vampires can't identify them.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.707
So if he had been hiding it entirely,

20:51.291 --> 20:53.710
it couldn't be helped not
to notice anything.

20:55.712 --> 20:56.880
But vampires,

20:57.756 --> 21:02.970
they're always afraid that they will lose
themselves once they see blood.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.432
I think that guy really liked you.

21:08.058 --> 21:11.270
But from the start,
demons shouldn't be with humans.

21:13.146 --> 21:13.981
Demons?

21:14.773 --> 21:17.359
Yes. Vampires.

21:20.737 --> 21:21.738
Your mouth,

21:23.365 --> 21:24.658
it's bleeding.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.660
You only saw it now?

21:26.743 --> 21:29.204
The inside of my mouth got cut
when you pushed me earlier!

21:30.247 --> 21:31.873
Weren't you too harsh a while ago?

23:23.485 --> 23:24.319
OCCULT WEBSITES

23:25.737 --> 23:26.905
Devil's Line.

23:27.739 --> 23:28.782
Line 2.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.700
Safehouse.
