10:52.188 --> 10:53.817
My instructions were clear.

10:53.818 --> 10:56.277
Don Juan was to get
a full week of recovery.

10:56.278 --> 10:57.897

10:57.898 --> 10:59.794

11:08.068 --> 11:11.647
He earned a multi-million dollar
purse just last week at Belmont.

11:11.648 --> 11:13.027

11:13.028 --> 11:14.487
(Janna) Hey, handsome.

11:14.488 --> 11:16.028
- Janna.
- I'm glad you could make it.

11:17.358 --> 11:18.857
I had a little trouble getting in

11:18.858 --> 11:20.277

11:20.278 --> 11:22.147
Ugh, I should've warned you.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.437
You knew they'd be here?

11:23.438 --> 11:26.277
Oh, yeah, they've been here
since I was a kid.

11:26.278 --> 11:28.227
They're always accusing
Daddy of something.

11:28.228 --> 11:31.170
You know they're actually
taking us to trial next month?

her father for years.

Think they're about ready

11:47.874 --> 11:50.067
to make good on their threat
to put him down?

11:50.068 --> 11:51.647
I'm more inclined to think that someone

11:51.648 --> 11:53.777
in the Turner family wants to make sure

11:53.778 --> 11:55.857
that this wedding doesn't happen.

11:55.858 --> 11:57.357
Because if it does,

11:57.358 --> 11:59.727
Will would get half of Phoebe's fortune.

11:59.728 --> 12:03.230
Our best course of action is to
make sure the wedding proceeds.

12:03.231 --> 12:05.898
Guess we should track down
the bride and groom.

12:13.913 --> 12:16.492
(Reese) Finch, I've located
the bride with her sister.

12:16.493 --> 12:19.452
(Phoebe) I could just kill them, Karen.

12:19.453 --> 12:21.662
It has to be a misunderstanding.

12:34.623 --> 12:38.623
Well, I guess Don Juan
isn't buying it either.

12:40.953 --> 12:44.742
How did Will explain what happened?

12:44.743 --> 12:48.493
He didn't, because I ran away.

12:50.953 --> 12:54.082
Phoebe, people aren't perfect.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.579
Marriage isn't perfect.

don't let her get away.

15:28.583 --> 15:32.292
My dad always said,
after your falling out,

15:32.293 --> 15:34.702
how much he missed your singing voice.

Hello, Bruce.

Detective.

23:17.345 --> 23:19.344
Want another free lunch?

23:19.345 --> 23:20.474
I want you to tell me

23:20.475 --> 23:22.264
why Howard Carpenter's pissed at you.

23:22.265 --> 23:24.474
You saved my boss's life.

23:24.475 --> 23:25.844
I don't take that lightly.

23:25.845 --> 23:27.514
You threatened my son.

23:27.515 --> 23:29.264
I don't take that lightly.

23:29.265 --> 23:31.344
Several of the five families' companies

23:31.345 --> 23:33.554
have construction
contracts with the city.

23:33.555 --> 23:35.344
And you're greasing Howard's palms

23:35.345 --> 23:36.554
to get your contracts pushed through.

23:36.555 --> 23:39.514
There was a contract
to demolish a tunnel.

23:39.515 --> 23:42.884
Howard never received
the payment from me,

23:42.885 --> 23:45.844
but the odd thing is, the
company requesting the permit

23:45.845 --> 23:48.054
doesn't belong to one
of the five families.

23:48.055 --> 23:49.684

23:49.685 --> 23:51.514

23:52.885 --> 23:54.304

might get you killed.

23:57.635 --> 23:59.264
Well, that's what I keep hearing.

23:59.265 --> 24:00.634

24:00.635 --> 24:02.264

So your friend's keeping
you in the dark too.

24:09.595 --> 24:11.474
It's frustrating, isn't it?

24:11.475 --> 24:14.385
Enough to make you
question your loyalty.

24:19.185 --> 24:21.184
Okay, that was the most
stressful wedding ceremony

24:21.185 --> 24:22.514
I've ever attended.

24:22.515 --> 24:24.554
Seems like the protestors
want to make good

24:24.555 --> 24:26.514

put Kent Turner down.

24:26.515 --> 24:28.804
We need more information
on the protestors' case

24:28.805 --> 24:31.344

if we want to identify

24:31.345 --> 24:32.844
his would-be killers.

24:32.845 --> 24:35.844
I'll see if Detective Fusco
can unearth some details

24:35.845 --> 24:37.924
about the animal cruelty lawsuit.

24:37.925 --> 24:40.474
Meanwhile, perhaps the
security camera footage

24:40.475 --> 24:43.054
from the ceremony will
help us to find them.

24:43.055 --> 24:45.424
Well, that's convenient.

24:45.425 --> 24:47.424
The cameras shut off
during the ceremony.

24:47.425 --> 24:49.264
Finch, I know someone
who might've caught

24:49.265 --> 24:52.424

24:52.425 --> 24:54.054
