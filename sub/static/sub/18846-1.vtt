Leonard!

00:48.590 --> 00:50.884
Leonard!

00:54.137 --> 00:56.306
Whoa!
Aah...

00:56.348 --> 00:57.558
Leonard!

00:59.643 --> 01:00.769
Leonard!

01:01.937 --> 01:04.438
Aah!

01:06.233 --> 01:09.069
It hurts!
- Leonard.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.863
Leonard, I'm gonna have
to kill you, Leonard.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.739
I won't say anything.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.616
No, you'll talk,
Leonard.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.493
There are rules, Leonard.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.412
Stop moving, Leonard!

01:19.288 --> 01:21.290
You have a choice.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.585
Look at me, Leonard.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.253
Look at me.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.796
Robbie...

01:27.838 --> 01:30.299
Robbie.
Where's Robbie?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.759
I'm going
to visit my son.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.680
Aw, come on.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.044
Aaahhh!

02:07.085 --> 02:08.794
Yah!

02:31.068 --> 02:33.028
Aah-uh!

02:34.279 --> 02:36.573
Oi.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.112
What the fuck
are you doing?

04:55.879 --> 04:57.798
Come on, Manny.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.716
Come on, Manny.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.809
I wasn't with her.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.770
I lost it!
- Let's go back.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.565
<i># Premonition of ecstasy #</i>

05:14.606 --> 05:19.653
<i># Who would believe
it could be such a miracle #</i>

05:19.695 --> 05:21.405
Hello.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.699
<i>Where the hell are ya?
- What do you mean, Johnny?</i>

05:23.740 --> 05:25.576
I'm at my apartment,
like we said.

05:25.576 --> 05:28.871
I don't think splittin' up
was a good idea.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.247
Well, we're alive,
aren't we?

05:30.289 --> 05:31.957
<i>They follow you?
- I don't know yet.</i>

05:31.999 --> 05:33.625
W-why didn't you
answer the phone?

05:33.625 --> 05:36.003
I guess I didn't hear it
over the music.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.088
You know I don't like
the fucking cell phone.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.131
<i>What?</i>

05:39.131 --> 05:40.841
Get the fuck off
the cell phone.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.509
Jesus, Johnny, okay.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.178
You're the one
who called me on it.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.762
You know,
it could be any prick

05:45.804 --> 05:47.472
sittin' outside
your house on the C.B.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.141
<i>pickin' up the airwaves,
you know?</i>

05:49.183 --> 05:50.684
Did Joey La Torre
call yet?

05:50.726 --> 05:52.811
<i>No, but it--
it's early.</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:54.897
Okay, listen, uh...
turn the music down.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.940
Turn the music off.
Get off the cell phone.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.358
Just use a hard line.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.819
<i>Do you remember what that guy
in South Pas used to say?</i>

06:00.861 --> 06:03.197
He said, "Hard line
for businazz..."

06:03.238 --> 06:05.199
Yeah, "Cell phone
for piece-of-ass."

06:05.240 --> 06:07.159
All right, Johnny,
hold on a sec.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.036
Let me just, uh,
turn the music off.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.331
<i># Illusions of rapture #</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:13.749
Here you go.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.087
All right, I'm back.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.506
Okay. I'll call you
at 9:15.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.882
<i>A'ight. Hey, Johnny?</i>

06:21.924 --> 06:25.677
We're going to Florida,
you motherfucker!

06:25.719 --> 06:27.804
I know, Manny,
we're going to Florida.

06:27.846 --> 06:31.266
<i>Hey, but we did it, man.
We blasted into space.</i>

06:31.308 --> 06:33.560
<i>Our fathers never had
anything like this.</i>

06:33.644 --> 06:35.896
<i>We made up for it, right?</i>

06:35.938 --> 06:38.148
Yeah, Manny.
We--we did it.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.733
I'll call you
at 9:15.

06:39.775 --> 06:40.651
A'ight, a'ight.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.445
Hey, Johnny,
really, I love you.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.073
Thanks, man. O-okay.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.033
Hang up the phone, Manny.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.245
A'ight, man.
Flor-i-da! Flor-i-da!

06:51.286 --> 06:53.622
Heh. You feelin' it?

06:53.664 --> 06:55.958
Yeah, yeah.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.334
Okay.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.849
Hello?

07:53.891 --> 07:56.185
Hey, it's me.
I did it.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.857
Come get me.
Let's go to Florida.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.276
Can't you get
a little excited?

08:04.318 --> 08:07.571
I am excited.
- Cheryl, I just pulled off

08:07.613 --> 08:10.782
the biggest job in the
history of... history.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.159
This is where we
jump up and down

08:12.201 --> 08:13.785
and scream
and yell, right?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.954
<i>I'm sorry, baby,
you woke me up.</i>

08:17.831 --> 08:19.625
I'm dying to go
to Florida.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.294
I mean excited-- excited
for me, for what I did.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.880
<i>Johnny, you're
the best. Really.</i>

08:24.922 --> 08:26.757
Now there's no more shit.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.092
It's smooth sailing
all the way...

08:29.092 --> 08:31.887
so when are
you gonna come get me?

08:33.804 --> 08:36.517
No more shit?

08:38.602 --> 08:41.145
Johnny...
I love you.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.563
Yeah, me too.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.680
T.G.& R., how may I
direct your call?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.099
<i>It's me,
your ex-husband.</i>

09:17.140 --> 09:18.642
How are ya?

09:18.684 --> 09:19.977
<i>Is that why you called?</i>

09:20.018 --> 09:23.105
<i>No, but I thought
we could be cordial.</i>

09:23.146 --> 09:25.357
<i>You have
Alana's new number?</i>

09:25.399 --> 09:27.150
<i>It's the same number--</i>

09:27.150 --> 09:29.486
<i>the area code was changed
two years ago.</i>

09:29.528 --> 09:31.572
<i>You could've called
information.</i>

09:31.613 --> 09:34.157
Well, then I would've missed
your charming conversational skills.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.993
<i>That's true.
Hold, please.</i>

09:37.452 --> 09:39.705
Anderson wanted you
to call him.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.637
Okay, I'm back.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.931
Did you change any more
while I was gone?

09:58.015 --> 10:00.267
<i>The area code is 941.
Bye, John.</i>

10:00.309 --> 10:02.102
Aren't you gonna
ask me how I am?

10:02.186 --> 10:03.687
<i>How are you, John?</i>

10:03.729 --> 10:05.189
I'm great.
Really good.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.523
<i>You know,
smooth sailing.</i>

10:06.565 --> 10:09.401
<i>Great. Call again
next decade.</i>

10:09.401 --> 10:11.069
Good-bye.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.266
<i>You've reached
David, Alana, and Eddie.</i>

10:41.308 --> 10:43.268
<i>We're not here.
Leave a message.</i>

10:43.310 --> 10:44.645
Hey, Alana,
it's your dad.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.272
I just thought
I'd call and, uh...

10:47.272 --> 10:50.526
see if you wanted to
catch up, you know.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.779
I'm gonna be in Florida,
so, um, um...

10:53.779 --> 10:55.822
Doesn't have
to be right away--

10:55.822 --> 10:59.034
I know you're busy,
so think about it.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.624
...and I love you.
Fuck!

11:12.464 --> 11:15.259
<i>You've reached
David, Alana, and Eddie.</i>

11:15.300 --> 11:16.969
<i>We're not here.
Leave a message.</i>

11:16.969 --> 11:18.887
Yeah, and, uh...
and I love you.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.514
Okay. Okay, bye.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.643
You know,
you shouldn't smoke.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.687
It's unhealthy.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.355
I know, that's
why I like it.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.191
Hate the taste,
love the cancer.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.152
I'm pretty sure there's

12:15.194 --> 12:17.279
better-tasting ways
to get cancer.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.572
You a drug dealer?

12:18.614 --> 12:20.449
Do I look like
a drug dealer?

12:20.490 --> 12:21.575
No.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.162
But are you?

12:25.204 --> 12:27.623
Are you looking
to buy some drugs?

12:27.623 --> 12:29.583
Of course not.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.628
Then it shouldn't make any
difference how I look, should it?

12:32.628 --> 12:36.256
Shouldn't use drugs.
It can make you irrational.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.509
You don't know
the half of it.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.136
I heard you cuss.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.846
Shouldn't you
be in school?

12:42.888 --> 12:45.516
Nope. Holiday.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.185
Uh, no.
No, it's not a holiday.

12:48.227 --> 12:50.646
See, that's your problem
right there--skipping school.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.648
That leads
straight to drugs.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.608
Is that how
you started usin'?

12:54.650 --> 12:55.692
What?

12:55.734 --> 12:56.735
Usin'.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.529
It's slang for drugs.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.614
I know what it is.
- 'Course you do.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.616
Must know all
the slang, near, huh?

13:02.658 --> 13:04.785
What's your name, slick?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.329
My name--
my name is for my friends.

13:07.371 --> 13:08.580
Heh, me too.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.792
I'm Antoine, but most
of my homies call me A.T.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.673
It is a holiday, though.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.299
No, it's not.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.844
It's the fucking middle
of October.

13:21.885 --> 13:25.097
I don't see any floats, I don't see
any flags, I don't see any Santas.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.223
Don't see any of those.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.141
You think I'm stupid?
Are you stupid?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.977
Shouldn't tell kids
they're stupid.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.895
They do grow up
to believe it.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.689
Did your mom
tell you that?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.732
No. I figured it out.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.359
Well, you're
probably right.

13:37.401 --> 13:38.861
Is that what
happened to you?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.031
I don't have time
for you, kid.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.575
You don't have time?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.034
You're sitting
on a bench, man.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.494
I'm thinking.
- About what?

13:47.536 --> 13:50.372
What a miracle my life's
gonna be when you vanish.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.875
That hurts my feelings.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.168
Really?

13:54.209 --> 13:57.045
Does it? I'm sorry.
I really am...

13:57.087 --> 13:59.923
but I just need
some time alone, okay?

14:10.559 --> 14:12.769
Maybe he
just works here.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.271
He doesn't work here.

14:14.313 --> 14:17.065
They go inside, they make the
transaction, then we move in.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.484
They're never gonna
believe we're real cops,

14:19.484 --> 14:21.111
'cause this is not
a real cop car.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.654
Listen, we're
down the street.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.157
It's gonna happen so fast
they won't notice.

14:25.157 --> 14:29.161
I need a doughnut. If I had a
doughnut, I'd feel like a real cop.

14:29.161 --> 14:32.164
Oh, this does not look like
a business transaction.

14:32.164 --> 14:34.416
What the hell is that?

14:37.336 --> 14:39.296
Hey, hey!

14:39.338 --> 14:41.548
Hey!

14:55.479 --> 14:58.315
Oh, no. Oh, no.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.375
Oh, fuck!

15:29.972 --> 15:32.224
Hey! Hold it
right there.

15:32.266 --> 15:34.017
Don't shoot me.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.979
I'm a civilian, see?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.231
You know why
this door's ajar?

15:39.231 --> 15:41.108
Um, kidneys.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.860
Uh, you know,

15:42.901 --> 15:44.987
you drink beer,
you gotta piss.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.781
Why?
Goddamn kidneys.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.492
How many drinks
have you had tonight, sir?

16:01.003 --> 16:03.255
Well, uh,
John got smashed.

16:03.297 --> 16:05.883
I'm designated,
Officer, don't worry--

16:05.883 --> 16:07.968
I'm dry as a bone.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.345
So, I'm drivin'
John home, and, uh...

16:10.387 --> 16:11.513
You know, he's gotta--

16:15.267 --> 16:17.352
Leonard. Leonard!

16:26.486 --> 16:28.322
So, pissing
wakes his wife up

16:28.363 --> 16:30.616
but coming
into the house doesn't?

16:30.616 --> 16:32.284
Um...

16:32.326 --> 16:34.828
Well, the bathroom
is right by the bed.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.164
What if he don't flush?

16:37.206 --> 16:38.874
Um...

16:38.916 --> 16:40.918
Eh, she's gonna see
it in the morning.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.470
Put down the gun!

16:51.512 --> 16:53.847
Put the gun down!

16:53.847 --> 16:55.682
Step away slowly,
put your hands

16:55.724 --> 16:57.476
behind your head,
and face the window.

16:57.518 --> 17:00.646
Oh, God!

17:11.156 --> 17:13.282
The battery's dead.

17:13.325 --> 17:16.161
Go away.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.838
<i>Hello.
- It's John.</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:27.464
Look, La Torre
and his guys just called.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.007
They want to change
the meeting place.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.217
<i>I choose the place.</i>

17:30.217 --> 17:32.010
<i>I know, that's
what I told 'em.</i>

17:32.052 --> 17:33.762
Manny, tell me
what they said.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.430
Tell me exactly
what they said.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.016
<i>They said there was some
heat at the original place.</i>

17:38.058 --> 17:39.476
Wait, wait, wait,
they said--

17:39.518 --> 17:41.770
They suggested that you pick me up?
- Yeah.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.480
Listen, here's
what's gonna happen.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.607
I'm gonna call you back
on your cell phone.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.651
John, the cell phone--
- It's gonna be fine.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.987
I'm gonna tell you exactly
where I'm located, okay?

17:50.028 --> 17:51.655
We're gonna have
this same conversation.

17:51.697 --> 17:54.032
You're gonna say exactly
the same thing on the cell phone.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.200
<i>Understand?
- Yeah.</i>

17:55.242 --> 17:56.952
<i>Manny, you're gonna
be fine, okay?</i>

17:56.994 --> 17:58.412
<i>I'm calling you
right back.</i>

18:23.270 --> 18:25.022
<i>Hello?
- Yeah, Manny, it's John.</i>

18:25.063 --> 18:26.523
Did they call yet?

18:26.565 --> 18:28.025
Yeah, they called.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.694
They--they--
they want to...

18:30.694 --> 18:32.529
<i>They want to
change the place,</i>

18:32.571 --> 18:34.364
<i>the, uh,
the meeting place.</i>

18:34.406 --> 18:35.490
What?

18:35.532 --> 18:37.326
<i>Yeah, that's
what they said,</i>

18:37.326 --> 18:39.786
<i>and then they said
there was some heat,</i>

18:39.828 --> 18:41.788
<i>you know, like,
at the place.</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:43.624
They want to change it

18:43.665 --> 18:45.918
to Poppy's
on the east side.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.170
<i>That's... all they said.</i>

18:48.212 --> 18:49.338
No, no, no,
fuck that.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.882
I got the case,
I choose the place.

18:51.882 --> 18:54.510
Should I call them back
and tell them to fuck off,

18:54.551 --> 18:57.012
tell those little shits
to kiss my ass?

18:57.054 --> 18:59.431
Tell those motherfuck--
- Manny, Manny.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.642
<i>Do you have a car?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

19:01.683 --> 19:03.852
Should I, uh,
should I come and get you?

19:03.894 --> 19:05.229
<i>Yeah, come get me.</i>

19:05.270 --> 19:06.563
I'm at
the Mexican market

19:06.605 --> 19:08.607
across the street
from Echo Park.

19:08.607 --> 19:12.110
You got that? West side
of Echo Park, Mexican market.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.155
Hey, Manny, let's-- let's give 'em
about ten minutes to sweat it.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.407
I want to finish my taco.
It's really good.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.618
Fine, yeah,
finish your taco.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.873
Not so close
to the water!

19:39.137 --> 19:40.764
Joey La Torre,
you son of a--

19:47.688 --> 19:50.023
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What is this?

19:50.065 --> 19:51.400
What--hey!

20:00.492 --> 20:01.493
Hey-lo?

20:01.535 --> 20:02.911
<i>Manny, get
out of there.</i>

20:02.953 --> 20:04.413
<i>But I'm just
a couple minutes away.</i>

20:04.413 --> 20:06.081
Wherever you're at,
turn around, okay?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.666
What about Florida?

20:07.708 --> 20:09.626
We're going to Florida.
Just get out of there.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.045
Oh!

20:12.045 --> 20:14.173
<i>They got me, Johnny!</i>

20:50.292 --> 20:52.544
Not so close
to the water!

20:53.795 --> 20:55.839
Come on, Nicholas,
not so close to the water.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.382
Time out, okay?

21:08.268 --> 21:10.229
No.
- Hey, just a--

21:20.405 --> 21:22.157
What?

21:22.157 --> 21:23.784
It's John.
Don't hang up.

21:23.826 --> 21:26.119
Hell, no.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.462
Motherfucker,
what time is it?

21:35.504 --> 21:36.880
9:30.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.841
<i>Morning or night?
- Morning.</i>

21:38.841 --> 21:41.093
<i>Don't hang up, don't
hang up, don't hang up.</i>

21:41.134 --> 21:43.637
Ugh. John,
can't this shit wait?

21:43.679 --> 21:46.974
No, it's too hot.
I gotta do it today.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.892
<i>What, did you do a job
without a fence?</i>

21:48.934 --> 21:51.061
No, I had one--
Joey La Torre.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.105
<i>He turned on me,
killed Manny.</i>

21:53.105 --> 21:55.065
Why would he do that?
Doesn't sound like Joey.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.733
<i>Yeah, tell that
to Manny.</i>

21:56.775 --> 21:58.360
All right, well,
how much do you need?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.862
It's priceless.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.155
<i>What'd you get,
a Fabergé egg?</i>

22:02.197 --> 22:03.532
It's better than that.

22:03.532 --> 22:06.243
How much do you need
to be willing to let go of it?

22:06.285 --> 22:08.453
<i>Four.
- What, am I high?</i>

22:08.453 --> 22:10.164
<i>You're gonna be.</i>

22:10.205 --> 22:11.874
We can turn this
into $10 million

22:11.915 --> 22:13.834
in the street
by tonight.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.836
<i>Then why didn't you ask for ten?
- 'Cause I'm up in it.</i>

22:15.878 --> 22:17.629
<i>Why do you think I called
your stupid ass?</i>

22:17.671 --> 22:19.631
Hey, hey,
show some respect.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.216
<i>It's gonna take
some time.</i>

22:21.258 --> 22:23.010
I don't have time.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.512
Well, make time, John.
Know your customer.

22:25.554 --> 22:27.764
I mean, these motherfuckers
at 9:00 in the morning

22:27.806 --> 22:29.558
haven't come down
from their coke yet.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.144
Listen, they see this shit,
they're gonna sober right up.

22:32.186 --> 22:33.520
<i>All right,
give me two hours.</i>

22:33.562 --> 22:34.938
I'm gonna call
you back in one.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.648
<i>Hey, I can't drop a deuce
in an hour!</i>

22:36.690 --> 22:38.317
I'm gonna call you back
in one hour.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.068
Tell me what you got.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.404
I can't do that.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.615
John, you gotta tell me
what you got.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.825
I'm gonna call you back
in one hour!

23:01.757 --> 23:03.592
Two tequilas.
Nah, whiskey.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.182
Hey, John.

23:12.768 --> 23:15.646
Hey. How ya doin'?

23:15.729 --> 23:18.023
Good.
- Whiskey go with that beer?

23:18.065 --> 23:19.691
You know it does.

23:22.694 --> 23:25.072
You look rode hard
and put away wet.

23:26.573 --> 23:27.991
My son called.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.409
There you go.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.036
Well, that's a good thing.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.663
First thing
he says to me--

23:32.704 --> 23:34.248
"I know you're
not coming."

23:36.166 --> 23:38.752
I once told the kid
that if I ever made enough,

23:38.752 --> 23:42.214
I'd move out there.
Phoenix.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.882
What you gonna do?

23:43.882 --> 23:45.634
I'm gonna go
next week,

23:45.676 --> 23:47.427
after I finish
this job up.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.680
Job? What job?

23:49.721 --> 23:52.558
All I see of you,
you're like Tequila Tex

23:52.599 --> 23:55.644
on your stool,
your trusty steed.

23:55.686 --> 23:57.855
Yeehaw!

24:00.440 --> 24:03.485
Uh, what kind of job?
What is it, anyway?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.907
You could call it
quality control.

24:08.949 --> 24:10.826
Well, what the hell
does that mean,

24:10.868 --> 24:12.744
like, seeing
if the teddy bear's

24:12.786 --> 24:14.830
got both eyes?

24:16.748 --> 24:18.500
Somebody wants
to buy something;

24:18.542 --> 24:20.586
I tell 'em whether
it's a fake or not.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.173
And... somebody
pays you?

24:26.133 --> 24:28.385
Leonard, you're
a piece of work.

24:35.017 --> 24:36.643
He almost fell
into the lake!

24:47.779 --> 24:49.740
Hello.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.700
It's me.

24:51.742 --> 24:53.911
If anyone calls,
don't answer it.

24:54.870 --> 24:56.371
Are you okay?

24:56.413 --> 24:58.373
I'm okay, just don't
answer the phone.

24:58.415 --> 25:00.042
Go make sure
your door's locked,

25:00.042 --> 25:01.960
and if anyone knocks,
don't answer it,

25:02.002 --> 25:03.629
not even if
it's the police.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.880
<i>The police?</i>

25:04.922 --> 25:07.257
<i>Yeah, something
happened to Manny.</i>

25:07.257 --> 25:09.510
Does this mean we're
not gonna go to Florida?

25:09.551 --> 25:12.221
<i>You're going to Florida.
Just do like I say.</i>

25:57.099 --> 25:58.976
Hello?

25:58.976 --> 26:01.144
<i>Hey, Alana,
it's your dad.</i>

26:01.186 --> 26:03.063
<i>How you doin'?</i>

26:04.481 --> 26:06.358
I don't think
I want to talk to you.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.152
Well, uh,
I'm just callin'

26:09.152 --> 26:12.573
to see how you're doin',
and, uh...

26:12.573 --> 26:14.032
see if you wanted
to catch up,

26:14.074 --> 26:16.118
if you--you and him
doin' all right?

26:16.118 --> 26:18.162
<i>You guys need
any money?</i>

26:18.162 --> 26:21.790
Dad, I can't do this.

26:21.832 --> 26:24.459
This has nothing
to do with me.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.004
Um, okay, let me
talk to Edward.

26:27.045 --> 26:28.797
C-can he talk now?

26:28.797 --> 26:30.674
Do you want
to undermine me?

26:30.716 --> 26:32.509
<i>Undermine?</i>

26:32.551 --> 26:34.052
I just wanna talk
to my grandson.

26:34.094 --> 26:36.638
I mean, how often do I call?
I mean, how of--

26:36.680 --> 26:40.434
We've been here every day
for the past three years.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.352
Yeah, well,
it's different now.

26:42.394 --> 26:44.521
<i>Why?
- I...</i>

26:44.563 --> 26:46.648
Well, it's...
I got some money.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.734
Money?
- Yeah.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.945
I got some money,
and I'm coming to Florida.

26:55.532 --> 26:58.118
You have got a lot of nerve
asking me to be here for you.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.412
I'm not asking--
just--just--

27:00.412 --> 27:02.623
let me talk
to you, okay?

27:02.664 --> 27:04.249
Dad, I'm going now.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.751
No, no! Listen...

27:05.792 --> 27:07.586
Dad, you can't
boss me around.

27:07.586 --> 27:09.505
You never listen.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.174
I'm not--I'm--
I'm list--I'll listen.

27:12.174 --> 27:14.176
How can you act like
you care about someone?

27:14.218 --> 27:15.427
I'll listen.

27:15.469 --> 27:18.055
You're not even interested in--
- What?

27:21.475 --> 27:22.935
I'm gonna go.

27:22.976 --> 27:25.187
Listen, listen...
I'm listening, okay?

27:25.187 --> 27:26.772
I didn't call for--

27:26.813 --> 27:28.815
No, no, no,
I didn't call for any--

27:28.857 --> 27:30.817
I'm just--
I'm listening, okay?

27:30.859 --> 27:32.486
Listen. Hear that?

27:32.528 --> 27:34.404
That pause right there?

27:34.446 --> 27:36.949
That static, that right
there was me listening.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.575
I can't do this.

28:00.138 --> 28:01.932
Oh, not too bad.

28:09.773 --> 28:11.859
Come here
to meet someone?

28:11.900 --> 28:13.777
You here to skip school?

28:13.777 --> 28:15.654
I'm not skipping school.

28:15.654 --> 28:17.739
It's where I always
come for the holidays.

28:17.781 --> 28:20.284
I just think you're here to
meet someone, just sitting here.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.702
You're just sittin' here.

28:21.702 --> 28:23.495
No, I'm not,
I'm people-watching.

28:23.537 --> 28:24.913
Oh, you're casing people.

28:24.955 --> 28:27.249
You casing me now,
is that what you're doing?

28:27.249 --> 28:28.292
Nah.

28:28.292 --> 28:30.043
The pigeon man, though.

28:30.085 --> 28:32.963
The pigeon man?
What you got on him?

28:33.005 --> 28:34.548
He's a widow.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.758
A widow?

28:36.800 --> 28:38.719
Yeah. His wife died.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.554
Oh, a widower.

28:40.596 --> 28:42.472
Yeah, that's--
that's what I said.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.349
Boy, he's dying, too.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.143
How you know that?

28:46.226 --> 28:48.353
Because the scar
on his hand from Dallas.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.479
Dallas?

28:49.479 --> 28:52.191
Yeah, where they pump
out your kidneys.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.026
You mean dialysis.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.777
That's what I said.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.739
Yeah, well, people can
live forever on dialysis.

28:58.739 --> 29:01.575
Yeah, but sometimes people
decide to stop going,

29:01.617 --> 29:03.076
and that's it.

29:03.076 --> 29:05.454
How do you know
he stopped going?

29:05.496 --> 29:08.874
'Cause the scar on his hand?
It's healing.

29:08.916 --> 29:11.960
I'll tell you about
the pigeon man.

29:12.002 --> 29:13.629
First of all,
he's not a bum.

29:13.629 --> 29:15.297
He's what you call
a soft mark.

29:15.339 --> 29:16.965
Sure, he's lonely--

29:17.007 --> 29:19.384
he's feedin' pigeons
in a dumb-ass park,

29:19.426 --> 29:21.762
but he's not a bum.
You see that?

29:21.803 --> 29:24.097
See that watch,
see that shine?

29:24.139 --> 29:25.849
He's got a Rolex.

29:25.891 --> 29:27.768
That means
he's got money.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.770
He's got it socked away,
doesn't want to let on.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.772
That's why he's dresses
in the ratty clothes.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.232
And he's lonely,
sure, he's lonely.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.483
What do
lonely people want?

29:34.483 --> 29:35.734
Friends.
- That's right.

29:35.776 --> 29:36.944
So I become
his best friend.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.487
"Hey, let's have lunch
every Thursday.

29:38.529 --> 29:39.863
How 'bout a little
business deal?"

29:39.863 --> 29:41.156
He's writing
a cashier's check

29:41.198 --> 29:43.367
faster than he can
change his wet diaper.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.577
I just think he's lonely
and his wife died.

29:45.619 --> 29:47.162
So will we.

29:47.204 --> 29:49.498
Yeah, well, I see
dollars, you see death.

29:49.540 --> 29:50.916
Take your pick, kid.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.793
So, who is he?
- Who what?

29:52.835 --> 29:54.670
The person
that you're meeting.

29:55.671 --> 29:57.422
Can I have the hotdog?

29:57.464 --> 29:59.132
Yeah, eat the hotdog.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.685
Hello.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.061
Who've you got for me?

30:11.103 --> 30:13.856
<i>No one. See, John, these people
are way smarter than me.</i>

30:13.897 --> 30:16.191
<i>They got people
answering their phones</i>

30:16.233 --> 30:18.235
so when assholes call
early in the morning

30:18.277 --> 30:20.237
they don't get woken up.
Isn't that crazy?

30:20.237 --> 30:21.822
I'm gonna get
an assistant, too.

30:21.864 --> 30:23.866
That way they can
tell you to fuck off!

30:23.907 --> 30:26.743
Well, then you'll miss out on
the pleasure of doing it yourself.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.036
When will you
know something?

30:28.078 --> 30:30.581
I said two hours, man.
That gives me an hour and a quarter.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.291
Now, chill out
and let me work my magic.

30:32.291 --> 30:33.917
Your magic?
- Yeah, man.

30:33.959 --> 30:35.586
<i>A little cereal,
a little Price is Right--</i>

30:35.627 --> 30:37.045
it's a beautiful day, man.

30:37.087 --> 30:37.921
Oh, you feeling it?

30:37.921 --> 30:39.756
<i>Oh, I'm in
the zone, baby.</i>

30:39.798 --> 30:41.925
<i>I'm gonna call you
in an hour and 14 minutes.</i>

30:42.009 --> 30:43.385
Cheeri-o.

30:43.427 --> 30:44.803
Cheerio.

30:48.974 --> 30:50.225
Go get something
to eat?

30:50.267 --> 30:51.518
Sure, what
do you want?

31:00.652 --> 31:03.906
Oh, your dog is so cute!
What's his name?

31:03.947 --> 31:05.407
Pancho.

31:46.031 --> 31:47.533
<i>Hello?</i>

31:47.574 --> 31:49.034
I'm running late.

31:49.076 --> 31:52.663
I'm horny. I put my nightie on for you.
When are you coming?

31:52.704 --> 31:54.790
Cheryl, I've
got business.

31:54.832 --> 31:58.460
I'm not wearing anything.
I'm naked.

31:58.502 --> 32:02.047
Jesus, Cheryl,
I can't do that out here.

32:02.047 --> 32:05.133
Well, I can do it
in here, baby.

32:06.301 --> 32:09.221
<i>I want your dick.</i>

32:09.263 --> 32:12.975
<i>Ohh... I'm on my tiptoes.</i>

32:17.271 --> 32:19.940
I can feel you
behind me.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.276
I'm right here.

32:25.112 --> 32:27.531
I'm all in you.

32:27.573 --> 32:31.577
<i>Yeah... </i>

32:35.747 --> 32:38.250
The double taco.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.711
Oh, yeah.

32:40.752 --> 32:43.547
Oh, the delivery man.

32:43.589 --> 32:44.840
What?

32:44.882 --> 32:46.717
He's up in my room.

32:49.970 --> 32:53.473
<i>In my bed. What would you do if
you came home right now? Tell me.</i>

32:53.473 --> 32:55.934
Why do you always have to bring
somebody else into it?

32:55.934 --> 32:58.353
What?
- It's always "some guy this, some guy that..."

32:58.395 --> 33:00.230
It's like you
don't even need me.

33:00.272 --> 33:02.065
You don't have
to get upset, baby.

33:02.107 --> 33:03.567
You know what,
you're cheap.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.194
How come I never
knew that till now?

33:05.235 --> 33:07.613
Fuck you! You're a fucking
asshole, you know that?

33:07.613 --> 33:08.697
Oh, yeah.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.225
Came to talk?

33:36.266 --> 33:38.352
Only empty bench.

33:46.235 --> 33:50.447
Huh--tuh-- you have something
in your ear right here.

33:50.489 --> 33:52.783
What are you talking about?
- No, it's, like, in your ear.

33:52.825 --> 33:54.618
It's red.

33:56.870 --> 33:59.540
You got it.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.436
Leonard!

34:23.730 --> 34:24.898
Leonard!

34:35.951 --> 34:36.869
Leonard!

34:47.462 --> 34:49.840
Do you have "gaydar"?

34:49.882 --> 34:51.091
What?

34:51.175 --> 34:52.551
Radar for gay people.

34:52.551 --> 34:54.969
Well, I know a few things,
if that's what you mean.

34:54.969 --> 34:58.098
Coo'. We're gonna do
a gaydar test.

34:58.140 --> 35:01.393
We'll scan the park
and see who shows up.

35:01.435 --> 35:03.145
Cool?

35:08.442 --> 35:11.111
Boop! Negative.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.114
Boop!

35:15.782 --> 35:20.496
Boop, boop.
Boop!

35:20.537 --> 35:21.497
Boop!

35:24.041 --> 35:26.835
What's
your final count?

35:26.877 --> 35:29.880
None.
- Heh, I found one.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.381
What, you gonna count
the ice cream guy?

35:31.423 --> 35:32.925
No...

35:32.966 --> 35:34.218
Me.

35:34.259 --> 35:35.469
You.

35:35.511 --> 35:36.845
I'm gay.
- You're gay.

35:36.845 --> 35:38.180
I'm gay
as a day in May.

35:38.222 --> 35:39.473
My mama's gay, too.

35:39.515 --> 35:41.892
That's where
I got gaydar.

35:41.934 --> 35:43.894
From Evelyn,
her girlfriend.

35:43.936 --> 35:45.854
She told you
you were gay?

35:45.896 --> 35:48.023
No, but she told me
what it was like.

35:48.065 --> 35:49.358
I don't like girls.

35:49.399 --> 35:51.235
I don't feel like
I fit in.

35:51.276 --> 35:53.070
What's wrong
with girls?

35:53.070 --> 35:55.614
Well, number one,
they like dumb stuff,

35:55.656 --> 35:57.491
and they don't know
how to play.

35:57.491 --> 35:59.284
Okay, let's keep
people-watching.

35:59.326 --> 36:00.953
Or park-watching.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.955
Like, that car there--

36:02.996 --> 36:04.456
does that car
come every day?

36:04.498 --> 36:05.791
Never seen it.

36:05.833 --> 36:07.709
What about that guy?

36:07.709 --> 36:10.671
Yeah. He gets high here
before work.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.214
And those
two guys there?

36:12.256 --> 36:13.715
Never seen
them before.

36:15.259 --> 36:16.802
Oh, shit.

36:19.054 --> 36:20.597
Give me your backpack.
- No!

36:20.639 --> 36:22.850
Give me your goddamn backpack.
- No!

36:22.933 --> 36:24.476
Be quiet.

36:24.518 --> 36:25.853
No!

36:28.814 --> 36:30.899
Quit crying and listen
to me. Come here.

36:30.941 --> 36:33.610
Listen to me.
We're gonna take a walk together.

36:33.652 --> 36:35.445
I've got a gun.

36:35.487 --> 36:37.156
I'm gonna use it.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.449
I'm calling the cops.
- You call the cops, we're both done,

36:39.491 --> 36:41.451
but you're gonna be first,
you understand me?

36:41.493 --> 36:43.162
Look.

36:45.539 --> 36:47.708
Can I hold it?
- No!

36:47.749 --> 36:49.209
All right,
after we're done.

36:49.251 --> 36:51.837
We're just gonna take
a walk now, all right?

36:53.839 --> 36:56.175
Slow down, slow down.
We'll walk right toward him.

36:56.216 --> 36:57.634
We're not afraid
of anything.

36:57.676 --> 37:01.305
Just gonna be
two guys out walkin'.

37:01.346 --> 37:03.807
We're gonna go get
some ice cream. Smile.

37:03.849 --> 37:07.394
And a... student
and his teacher.

37:12.316 --> 37:13.984
Okay, that's it.
Come on, let's go this way.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.277
Ice cream!

37:15.319 --> 37:16.487
Change of plan.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.405
Nope. I want my ice cream.

37:23.327 --> 37:26.079
I want chocolate,
and for him, I guess, too.

37:26.121 --> 37:27.998
I'll take
your backpack now.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.583
Okay.

37:34.338 --> 37:37.299
Listen, if that guy
comes any closer,

37:37.341 --> 37:39.760
just say hi, okay?

37:39.801 --> 37:40.928
Uh, why?

37:40.928 --> 37:44.056
It's a surprise.

37:44.097 --> 37:45.974
Hi, there.

37:53.565 --> 37:55.484
I think we
should go now.

37:55.484 --> 37:57.152
What was that?

37:57.152 --> 37:58.987
Good luck.

38:03.867 --> 38:06.119
What's in the bag?
Give me the bag.

38:06.119 --> 38:08.580
We wanna see what's in there.

38:08.622 --> 38:10.707
Are you in trouble?

38:10.749 --> 38:12.251
Yeah.

38:12.292 --> 38:13.961
Sort of.

38:14.002 --> 38:15.629
Follow me.

38:24.263 --> 38:26.515
There's a secret passage.

38:26.557 --> 38:29.059
Come on. Ehh!

38:29.142 --> 38:30.644
Come on!

38:36.692 --> 38:38.026
This is it.

38:40.112 --> 38:41.822
This is where...

38:41.864 --> 38:44.158
Civil War or something,

38:44.158 --> 38:46.451
um, like a magic act.

38:47.536 --> 38:50.205
Um, where
the naked lady

38:50.247 --> 38:51.957
disappears
through the trap door.

38:51.999 --> 38:54.001
Something like that.
This is like a locker.

38:54.001 --> 38:55.919
I don't think
she was naked.

38:55.961 --> 38:57.921
Well, bathing suit.

38:59.006 --> 38:59.923
You know.

39:02.801 --> 39:08.807
That's the door out back
to the Dumpsters.

39:09.975 --> 39:11.393
Whatcha think?

39:11.435 --> 39:12.811
Incredible.

39:19.193 --> 39:20.861
This...

39:20.903 --> 39:23.363
is my racquetball.

39:27.576 --> 39:29.536
This is Shaq.

39:29.620 --> 39:32.164
Everybody at school
tries to collect it.

39:32.206 --> 39:34.708
I really don't like him,
to be honest.

39:34.791 --> 39:36.335
Want it?

39:36.376 --> 39:37.878
I'm serious.

39:37.961 --> 39:40.881
Well... thanks,
but, uh...

39:42.466 --> 39:44.384
That's okay.

39:44.426 --> 39:46.887
How can you not like Shaq?
Everyone likes Shaq.

39:46.929 --> 39:49.598
I guess I'm just
not like everyone.

39:49.598 --> 39:52.267
These are some of the letters
that my grandma sent me.

39:52.309 --> 39:54.102
Um, yeah.

39:54.102 --> 39:58.023
She's dead now,
but...

39:58.065 --> 39:59.191
You know.

40:03.654 --> 40:05.489
This is my mom's hair

40:05.531 --> 40:07.366
when it was long...

40:07.407 --> 40:09.159
'for it got cut off.

40:12.996 --> 40:14.623
Wanna try?

40:29.221 --> 40:31.640
T.G.& R., how may I
direct your call?

40:31.682 --> 40:33.809
<i>It's John, Alice.</i>

40:33.851 --> 40:35.978
Did you forget
Alana's number?

40:35.978 --> 40:38.647
<i>Listen, you know
how to talk to her.</i>

40:38.689 --> 40:41.567
I thought
you could help me.

40:41.608 --> 40:44.111
John, you just talk.

40:44.153 --> 40:45.904
I don't do that.
I make a plan.

40:45.946 --> 40:48.073
That's your problem.

40:48.073 --> 40:50.617
That's what I do.
That's how I got where I am today.

40:50.659 --> 40:53.162
<i>Exactly.
- Hey, don't fuck with me.</i>

40:53.203 --> 40:55.581
<i>Oh, I'm serious.
- I wanna see the gun.</i>

40:55.622 --> 40:57.332
You said!

40:57.332 --> 40:58.959
Uh, hang on.

41:01.879 --> 41:03.755
Are you kidding me?
- You said I could.

41:03.797 --> 41:05.674
All right, all right.
Hang on.

41:10.220 --> 41:12.347
What are you--?
- Shh!

41:14.725 --> 41:17.060
All right. Here.
Now go play.

41:18.395 --> 41:20.063
You're dead.

41:20.147 --> 41:21.899
You have no idea.

41:23.442 --> 41:24.902
Over there.

41:30.115 --> 41:32.367
<i>Okay, I'm back.</i>

41:32.409 --> 41:34.578
The man with the plan.

41:34.620 --> 41:38.081
<i>You didn't seem to mind all
those years I had you set up.</i>

41:39.917 --> 41:41.919
I was a girl, John.

41:42.002 --> 41:43.962
Girls like things.

41:44.004 --> 41:46.173
<i>But things don't last.</i>

41:46.215 --> 41:48.634
<i>Oh, don't come off
like I was some phony,</i>

41:48.675 --> 41:51.345
<i>throwing dresses at you.
I mean...</i>

41:51.428 --> 41:52.638
You fell for me,
I fell for you.

41:52.679 --> 41:53.764
You know that.

41:54.890 --> 41:56.975
<i>First day of college,
sitting on those steps,</i>

41:57.017 --> 41:59.603
<i>thousand girls walk by,
and I pick you.</i>

41:59.645 --> 42:01.230
You picked my ass.

42:01.271 --> 42:03.023
<i>Well, it was
attached to you.</i>

42:05.609 --> 42:09.571
I didn't think that you
could still hurt my feelings.

42:09.613 --> 42:11.573
You can never underestimate
the man of action.

42:11.615 --> 42:14.576
Wait. Listen.
- I'd better go.

42:14.618 --> 42:17.579
Um... I asked
about you, okay?

42:18.914 --> 42:21.166
I asked all your friends
everything about you,

42:21.208 --> 42:23.710
what you liked to read,
what your favorite movie was,

42:23.752 --> 42:26.213
what your music was,
what your favorite song was.

42:26.255 --> 42:27.965
I stayed up late
when you got up early,

42:28.006 --> 42:29.508
was a morning person,
you're not.

42:29.550 --> 42:30.801
Everything. Food.

42:30.843 --> 42:33.220
Your favorite place,
Pantini's Famous.

42:33.262 --> 42:35.514
Yeah, I paid off
the manager there

42:35.556 --> 42:37.933
to clear the place out,
make your favorite--

42:37.933 --> 42:40.143
tiramisu, old man
with the violin...

42:40.185 --> 42:41.353
Viola.

42:41.395 --> 42:43.063
Viola, whatever.
Anyway...

42:43.105 --> 42:44.898
I didn't have
much money back then.

42:44.940 --> 42:46.942
It was a fortune to me.

42:46.984 --> 42:48.944
I blew every dime I had.

42:48.986 --> 42:51.071
Almost sold my goat.
I didn't care.

42:51.071 --> 42:53.824
I got the mos beautiful girl
in school, and I got her angle.

42:55.409 --> 42:57.202
But we went
for burgers.

42:59.705 --> 43:03.250
She gets in the car,
going on about this burger,

43:03.333 --> 43:06.420
she's got her heart
set on it...

43:06.503 --> 43:09.506
You were
such a wild horse.

43:09.590 --> 43:12.968
And I just realized, just right
then in that moment,

43:13.010 --> 43:15.512
just making you
happy was...

43:17.556 --> 43:19.391
all that mattered, so...

43:20.517 --> 43:21.768
I mean, I knew.

43:21.810 --> 43:23.770
That's when
I fell for you.

43:26.565 --> 43:28.901
You rented the whole place
out and never told me.

43:34.072 --> 43:35.616
I gotta go.

43:35.699 --> 43:38.368
If this is so hard for you,
why do you even start?

43:42.414 --> 43:44.708
You're just kidding
around, right?

43:44.750 --> 43:46.210
Shut up.

43:46.251 --> 43:48.212
Or what, you're
gonna shoot me?

43:48.253 --> 43:49.630
You don't want
to do that.

43:49.671 --> 43:51.798
You're mean.

43:55.886 --> 43:57.971
I'm sorry.

43:58.013 --> 44:00.265
No, you're not!

44:00.307 --> 44:03.519
Okay, you're right.
Um...

44:06.271 --> 44:07.981
What do you want
me to do?

44:09.441 --> 44:11.902
Show me what's in there.
Show me what's in the case.

44:14.404 --> 44:17.783
Okay. Um...

44:17.825 --> 44:21.078
I'll show you, and...

44:21.119 --> 44:23.539
If you give me
the gun first.

44:26.250 --> 44:29.670
No. Show me,
and I'll give you the gun.

44:31.463 --> 44:32.589
Okay.

44:37.386 --> 44:40.764
Be careful. You know
that's real, right?

44:40.806 --> 44:43.100
I'll show you
the case, okay?

44:43.141 --> 44:44.226
Yeah.

44:46.603 --> 44:48.897
I'll show you,
all right?

44:50.566 --> 44:51.942
You're mean.

44:51.984 --> 44:55.445
You're mean.
You're mean.

45:07.708 --> 45:09.209
John!

45:10.919 --> 45:12.462
Stop, John!

45:16.341 --> 45:18.177
Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get out!

45:18.218 --> 45:20.095
Hey! Ehh, hey!

45:20.137 --> 45:21.972
Let's go!

45:23.348 --> 45:25.058
Stop!

46:02.554 --> 46:05.182
<i>This is Max.
- What have you got?</i>

46:05.182 --> 46:07.267
<i>Nothing.
- What do you mean?</i>

46:07.309 --> 46:09.353
<i>Well, no buyers, chum.</i>

46:09.394 --> 46:12.231
The banks are closed.
It's a holiday.

46:12.272 --> 46:14.441
What the fuck is with the holidays?
What holiday?

46:14.483 --> 46:15.984
It's Columbus Day.

46:16.026 --> 46:17.778
<i>Well, that's not
a real holiday.</i>

46:17.820 --> 46:20.864
<i>Exactly, right?
What the fuck is Columbus, anyway?</i>

46:20.864 --> 46:22.407
Well, he did
discover America.

46:22.449 --> 46:23.951
Yeah, and I
discovered my ass

46:23.951 --> 46:26.286
but then realized it was
already there, Johnny.

46:26.328 --> 46:28.789
Then the Indians should've sailed
to Spain and told them about it.

46:28.831 --> 46:30.165
<i>And told them
to stay the fuck out.</i>

46:30.207 --> 46:32.042
Max, can I ask you
a personal question--

46:32.084 --> 46:35.379
are you having some Bob Marley-rasta-ganja-
vision quest on my ass?

46:35.420 --> 46:37.214
John, I don't know
if you realize this,

46:37.256 --> 46:38.549
but I'm South American,

46:38.549 --> 46:41.301
which means that I'm
at least half Indian, okay?

46:41.343 --> 46:44.012
<i>Don't you white people
read anymore?</i>

46:44.054 --> 46:46.682
<i>You guys are busy with
your Klan barbeques and shit.</i>

46:46.723 --> 46:49.309
Uh, hang on a second, Malcolm X.
We're talking history, right?

46:49.351 --> 46:51.395
I mean, Columbus did know
the world was round;

46:51.436 --> 46:52.813
he did know America
was there.

46:52.855 --> 46:54.523
Bullshit.

46:54.565 --> 46:56.441
He was sailing for Asia

46:56.483 --> 46:59.528
because he thought the walls
were made out of gold, okay?

46:59.570 --> 47:02.614
<i>He ran into America
and called us Indians</i>

47:02.656 --> 47:04.491
<i>because he thought
he was in India.</i>

47:04.533 --> 47:05.784
<i>Hombre was just lost.</i>

47:05.784 --> 47:07.870
Well, that's how you find
new and interesting stuff.

47:07.911 --> 47:09.246
At least the Spaniard
was brave.

47:09.246 --> 47:10.414
Shit, yeah,
he was brave.

47:10.497 --> 47:12.624
I ain't getting
in no motherfucking boat.

47:12.666 --> 47:14.710
By the way, he was
Italian, you dumb-dumb.

47:14.751 --> 47:17.296
<i>Wait, so you're saying discovering
half the known world</i>

47:17.296 --> 47:19.089
is sort of
a personal realization?

47:19.131 --> 47:21.550
<i>Exactly,
personal realization.</i>

47:21.592 --> 47:24.761
Like saying rock'n'roll didn't
exist before I heard my first record?

47:24.803 --> 47:26.889
Right. You see, Columbus
wants to sit back,

47:26.889 --> 47:28.515
mix Cheerios
with Cocoa Puffs,

47:28.557 --> 47:30.267
maybe put a little bit
of sugar on it.

47:30.309 --> 47:31.226
That's fine with me.

47:31.268 --> 47:32.728
I'll even have
a beer with it.

47:32.769 --> 47:34.813
But don't let
the kids out of school

47:34.855 --> 47:36.940
<i>thinking that he
discovered some shit.</i>

47:36.940 --> 47:38.734
You know, you're right.
Fuck Columbus.

47:38.775 --> 47:40.819
Exactly.
Fuck Columbus.

47:40.861 --> 47:43.363
<i>Max, I want to hear about my deal now,
if that's okay with you.</i>

47:43.405 --> 47:46.158
Well, uh...

47:47.367 --> 47:49.661
No banks,
no money, no deal.

47:49.703 --> 47:50.829
Who have you tried?

47:50.871 --> 47:54.416
<i>I've tried everybody,
all the big guns.</i>

47:56.418 --> 47:57.836
What about
Jimmy Espinosa?

47:57.878 --> 47:59.796
<i>I don't fuck with
Jimmy Espinosa.</i>

47:59.838 --> 48:01.298
<i>He has the cash.</i>

48:04.927 --> 48:06.386
How do you know?

48:06.428 --> 48:08.931
<i>'Cause he was usin' it
to buy this case last night.</i>

48:08.972 --> 48:10.807
<i>You knocked over
Jimmy Espinosa?</i>

48:10.807 --> 48:13.185
Well, that's how I know he'll
be real glad to buy it back.

48:13.227 --> 48:15.020
<i>That's why La Torre
turned on you.</i>

48:15.062 --> 48:17.064
La Torre hates Espinosa.

48:17.105 --> 48:20.734
<i>Apparently he likes
being alive more.</i>

48:22.152 --> 48:23.987
<i>You're a marked man, John.</i>

48:26.073 --> 48:27.407
I'll give you 25%.

48:27.407 --> 48:29.535
<i>You know, that's
very generous of you.</i>

48:29.576 --> 48:30.994
Thank you so much. Aw!

48:30.994 --> 48:33.622
The problem is that
Jimmy Espinosa is Hitler!

48:33.664 --> 48:35.249
Hitler had money.

48:35.290 --> 48:37.209
<i>Dude, he killed his mother!</i>

48:37.251 --> 48:38.585
<i>That's just a rumor.</i>

48:38.585 --> 48:41.255
<i>Nah, man. Nah, my boys
were in on that one.</i>

48:41.296 --> 48:43.757
She was skimming off
his operations,

48:43.799 --> 48:45.342
so he had to set
a precedent.

48:45.384 --> 48:46.885
So he put
his mother down.

48:48.679 --> 48:50.681
Three to the membrane!

48:50.722 --> 48:53.433
And then at the funeral,
he fills it with flowers,

48:53.475 --> 48:54.935
beautiful, all colors.

48:54.977 --> 48:57.396
You would've thought
that it was Princess Diana.

48:57.437 --> 48:59.022
Sounds like just
the guy I need.

48:59.064 --> 49:01.358
<i>Dude, Jimmy Espinosa
killed his mother,</i>

49:01.400 --> 49:04.194
and I know he ain't
popping out of your pussy,

49:04.236 --> 49:06.280
<i>so I know he's not gonna
care about killing you.</i>

49:06.321 --> 49:08.073
<i>And you took his briefcase?</i>

49:08.115 --> 49:09.867
Can you get me
Jimmy Espinosa?

49:12.161 --> 49:14.997
First Manny,
now Jimmy Espinosa.

49:15.038 --> 49:17.082
Do you have a way out?

49:18.542 --> 49:20.085
Not yet.

49:20.127 --> 49:22.379
<i>Well, then you
have nothing.</i>

49:25.007 --> 49:27.217
<i>I got the case.
- Besides that.</i>

49:27.259 --> 49:29.428
I got you, and you
could do anything.

49:29.428 --> 49:31.346
Do it. Max?

49:31.388 --> 49:33.599
Max, do it.

49:34.474 --> 49:37.769
Let's go find
the New World.

49:43.525 --> 49:46.069
Is this kid with you?

49:46.069 --> 49:47.154
What?

49:47.196 --> 49:49.698
Well, he said
you were his dad.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.158
Adopted.

49:51.158 --> 49:54.036
Antoine, what are you lying
to the officers for?

49:54.077 --> 49:55.329
I married his mom.

49:55.370 --> 49:57.122
Paddleboat guy
caught him trying

49:57.122 --> 49:58.832
to take one out
without paying.

49:58.874 --> 50:00.542
Lying and now
you're stealing?

50:00.584 --> 50:01.752
What's wrong with you?

50:01.752 --> 50:03.712
I told you I'd be
a minute on the phone.

50:03.712 --> 50:05.172
Dude...

50:05.214 --> 50:06.757
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

50:06.757 --> 50:08.592
You are this
kid's father?

50:08.634 --> 50:10.260
Stepfather.

50:15.641 --> 50:18.810
Seeing a cop's kind of--
kind of scary, huh?

50:18.810 --> 50:21.021
Your dad's not around?

50:24.566 --> 50:26.610
Can I ride
the paddleboat?

50:32.533 --> 50:34.201
Ack. Whoo!

50:34.243 --> 50:35.911
This is fun.

50:35.953 --> 50:37.287
Unh.

50:38.497 --> 50:40.332
Eh.

50:44.002 --> 50:46.380
Ah. What's inside?

50:46.421 --> 50:48.924
Can't you
just describe it?

50:48.966 --> 50:50.634
Fountain of youth.

50:53.136 --> 50:56.515
Like El Dorado,
the lost city of gold?

50:56.557 --> 50:59.893
How the hell do you
know about El Dorado?

50:59.935 --> 51:02.521
We're studying
the conquistadors.

51:02.563 --> 51:05.274
Well, I'm the king
of the conquistadors.

51:05.315 --> 51:07.276
But they never found
El Dorado.

51:07.276 --> 51:09.069
Well, they never had
this briefcase.

51:10.737 --> 51:12.072
Hmm.

51:12.114 --> 51:14.950
Well, we have
to memorize that poem,

51:14.992 --> 51:17.995
"Eldorado,"
by Edgar Allan Pow.

51:18.036 --> 51:20.956
Poe.
- That's what I said.

51:20.998 --> 51:22.583
Want to hear it?

51:22.624 --> 51:25.460
Sure. It'll be
my theme song.

51:33.051 --> 51:36.847
"Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,

51:36.889 --> 51:39.975
"In sunshine
and in shadow,

51:40.017 --> 51:43.562
"Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,

51:43.604 --> 51:46.231
"In search of Eldorado.

51:46.273 --> 51:48.192
"But he grew old--

51:48.233 --> 51:51.028
"This knight
oh so bold--

51:51.069 --> 51:53.780
"And o'er his heart
a shadow

51:53.822 --> 51:56.533
"Fell as he found

51:56.575 --> 51:59.161
"No spot of ground

51:59.203 --> 52:02.706
That looked
like Eldorado."

52:02.706 --> 52:05.417
That's good.

52:05.459 --> 52:07.044
But it's not over.

52:07.085 --> 52:09.213
You didn't even
let me finish.

52:09.254 --> 52:10.881
Okay.
- Sorry.

52:10.923 --> 52:12.424
Yeah...

52:12.466 --> 52:15.469
"As he found
No spot of ground..."

52:15.511 --> 52:18.472
He found...
no spot of ground...

52:18.514 --> 52:20.140
You want me
to quiz you?

52:20.182 --> 52:21.683
You gotta do it
for school, right?

52:21.725 --> 52:23.227
You might as well
get it right.

52:24.937 --> 52:26.522
I guess.
- Okay.

52:29.274 --> 52:30.859
"As he found..."

52:30.901 --> 52:34.613
"No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado."

52:35.823 --> 52:38.033
"And as his strength..."

52:38.075 --> 52:40.619
"Failed him at length..."

52:40.619 --> 52:43.163
"He met a pilgrim shadow."

52:43.163 --> 52:47.000
"'Shadow,' said he,
'Where can it be--

52:47.042 --> 52:49.461
This land of Eldorado?'"

52:49.503 --> 52:52.422
"'Over the Mountains
of the Moon,

52:52.506 --> 52:55.384
"'Down the Valley
of the Shadow,

52:55.425 --> 52:58.595
"'Ride, boldly ride,'
The shade replied--

52:58.637 --> 53:01.473
'If you seek
for Eldorado.'"

53:04.017 --> 53:07.396
So, El Dorado--
to find it, you have to be dead.

53:07.437 --> 53:09.982
That's what
the workbook said.

53:10.023 --> 53:11.483
You keep looking for it,

53:11.525 --> 53:14.153
but it kills you
because you can't find it.

53:14.194 --> 53:16.280
Well, that's your poem.

53:16.321 --> 53:18.115
But you said El Dorado.

53:18.157 --> 53:20.159
Yeah, well, I found it.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.161
I don't believe you.

53:22.202 --> 53:25.998
Besides, if El Dorado
was in there,

53:26.039 --> 53:28.250
you'd be
a lot happier.

53:42.639 --> 53:43.765
Hello?

53:46.310 --> 53:47.644
<i>- Hello?</i>

53:47.728 --> 53:49.480
H-hello?

53:50.647 --> 53:51.732
You talk to him,

53:51.732 --> 53:53.317
you can talk to me
about your green card.

53:53.358 --> 53:55.652
<i>Hello?
- Cheryl, it's me.</i>

53:55.694 --> 53:57.613
<i>Baby, I'm worried
about you.</i>

53:57.654 --> 53:59.490
<i>Why don't you
come home?</i>

53:59.531 --> 54:02.868
<i>When I'm finished
with my business.</i>

54:06.580 --> 54:07.831
<i>Where are you, honey?</i>

54:09.249 --> 54:12.002
<i>I'm staying safe.</i>

54:12.044 --> 54:13.921
Where?

54:13.921 --> 54:16.215
I'll pick you up,
sweetie.

54:18.592 --> 54:21.470
No, I got a meeting first

54:21.512 --> 54:23.430
with Jimmy Espinosa.

54:24.348 --> 54:26.099
Uh, I'll pick you up
when it's over.

54:27.893 --> 54:29.478
I miss you.

54:31.313 --> 54:33.232
I miss you, too.

54:35.526 --> 54:37.861
So there's that.

54:37.903 --> 54:40.113
Whew.

54:40.113 --> 54:42.324
He's working off a tower
in Silver Lake.

54:42.366 --> 54:43.909
He's definitely outside.

54:43.951 --> 54:45.494
If he's outside,
he can be seen.

54:54.670 --> 54:57.172
I got Jimmy Espinosa.
- Yes!

54:57.172 --> 54:59.758
<i>He's offering 1.5.</i>

54:59.758 --> 55:00.968
One point five,
I'll take it.

55:01.009 --> 55:03.178
<i>But, see, John,
I think the real deal</i>

55:03.220 --> 55:06.515
here is that he wants
to show up and kill you.

55:06.557 --> 55:07.850
Yeah, I'm working
that part out.

55:07.891 --> 55:10.269
<i>I'm serious, John.
I'm worried about you, man.</i>

55:10.269 --> 55:12.271
He don't feel good.

55:12.312 --> 55:15.357
<i>Max, I'm at Echo Park.
Gonna meet at the bandstand.</i>

55:15.399 --> 55:18.402
<i>Bandstand?
- Yeah, it's the gazebo thing covered in ivy.</i>

55:18.402 --> 55:20.988
<i>Listen, tell Espinosa
to get the money,</i>

55:21.029 --> 55:22.781
<i>come downtown
to Grand and First.</i>

55:22.823 --> 55:25.576
You're gonna call him in half
an hour and tell him where to go.

55:25.617 --> 55:27.202
He's got ten minutes
to get there.

55:27.244 --> 55:29.830
Tell him I got three shooters
on the roof surrounding him,

55:29.913 --> 55:31.832
<i>so he's gotta come
unarmed and alone.</i>

55:31.874 --> 55:33.292
He won't come alone.

55:33.333 --> 55:35.460
<i>At least he'll
have to hide his guys.</i>

55:35.502 --> 55:37.588
<i>John, tell me you know
what you're doing.</i>

55:37.629 --> 55:39.089
I know what I'm doing.

55:39.089 --> 55:41.675
If I don't see you,
I'm gonna have a beer for you.

55:41.717 --> 55:44.219
<i>I'll call you back.
I gotta handle some business.</i>

56:07.075 --> 56:08.994
Gotta go soon.

56:09.036 --> 56:10.913
Won't come back.

56:16.418 --> 56:18.545
You keep that
for a while.

56:20.964 --> 56:22.549
Does your daughter
like you?

56:23.884 --> 56:26.011
I don't think so.

56:26.053 --> 56:27.846
If I was your kid...

56:27.846 --> 56:29.598
I would like you.

56:29.640 --> 56:30.849
Thanks.

56:31.558 --> 56:33.310
I don't think
my mom likes me.

56:33.352 --> 56:35.437
Oh, sure she does.
I'm sure she loves ya.

56:35.479 --> 56:38.148
Mm, that's what
people say.

56:38.190 --> 56:40.192
But...

56:40.234 --> 56:42.611
<i>when she's watching
Wheel of Fortune,</i>

56:42.653 --> 56:44.404
I'll ask her,

56:44.446 --> 56:47.199
"Why can Ariel talk
when she's a mermaid,

56:47.241 --> 56:49.243
but not
when she's a person?"

56:49.284 --> 56:51.703
And she'll say,
"Shut up, Antoine."

56:51.745 --> 56:54.164
Well, I'm--I'm sure
that's 'cause

56:54.164 --> 56:55.499
she's got stuff
on her mind.

56:55.541 --> 56:57.584
That doesn't mean
she doesn't love you.

56:57.626 --> 56:59.002
How do you know?

56:59.044 --> 57:00.712
Well, because
I'm a parent.

57:00.712 --> 57:02.297
Parents know
these things.

57:02.297 --> 57:05.259
There's a parent-child,
uh, bond.

57:05.259 --> 57:08.178
It doesn't matter
what they do,

57:08.220 --> 57:09.513
you just love 'em.

57:09.555 --> 57:10.931
It's instinct, ya know?

57:10.931 --> 57:12.140
That's the bitch
of it all--

57:12.182 --> 57:14.893
it doesn't matter
what you did or didn't do,

57:14.935 --> 57:16.270
and nothing...

57:16.311 --> 57:18.772
nothing changes that,
nothing.

57:27.114 --> 57:30.033
I need a bahoo!

57:30.075 --> 57:31.493
There.

57:31.535 --> 57:33.328
I need this one.
- All right.

57:35.914 --> 57:37.207
Hello?

57:37.249 --> 57:40.419
Alana, hey,
it's your dad.

57:40.460 --> 57:41.879
I'm kind of
busy right now.

57:41.920 --> 57:43.797
<i>Well, but--hang on.
- Come here, let's get out.</i>

57:43.839 --> 57:45.674
<i>There's some things
that I want to tell you,</i>

57:45.674 --> 57:48.844
just some things that
I want to ask you.

57:50.220 --> 57:51.722
Is this a speech?

57:51.722 --> 57:55.934
<i>No, but I... but I know
what I want to say.</i>

57:55.976 --> 57:57.561
<i>I know that
every time I call...</i>

57:59.104 --> 58:01.148
there are, uh...

58:01.190 --> 58:03.150
things that I--
I want to ask you

58:03.233 --> 58:04.860
that I don't know
about you,

58:04.902 --> 58:07.404
<i>and I, uh,
just thought</i>

58:07.404 --> 58:09.615
<i>maybe you've got
the same list.</i>

58:09.656 --> 58:11.867
<i>And I thought,
"What if I just call</i>

58:11.867 --> 58:14.119
<i>and let you ask?"</i>

58:14.161 --> 58:16.413
I ask you
and then what?

58:18.457 --> 58:20.542
Nothing.

58:20.584 --> 58:22.878
You just--you just, uh...

58:22.878 --> 58:24.505
listen.

58:26.173 --> 58:27.674
Anything.

58:27.716 --> 58:29.092
Yeah, that's what I'm--

58:29.134 --> 58:30.719
Why'd you leave?

58:37.267 --> 58:39.686
Guess that shows
how much you care.

58:39.728 --> 58:41.146
I want to go.

58:41.188 --> 58:42.606
No, no, no--

58:45.067 --> 58:48.779
When you were, like, seven--
six or seven--

58:48.821 --> 58:52.491
um, me and your mom
had a really bad fight.

58:52.533 --> 58:55.702
I threw something,
or she did--I don't remember.

58:55.702 --> 58:59.081
It was really loud,
and, uh, she left.

58:59.122 --> 59:03.252
Sh-she slammed the door,
and I sure don't blame her,

59:03.252 --> 59:07.297
but... well, you--
you came out.

59:07.339 --> 59:11.385
You were crying
really, really bad.

59:11.385 --> 59:13.262
Like--like someone cut you,

59:13.303 --> 59:15.347
you know,
just screaming and...

59:15.389 --> 59:19.518
Do you remember you had--
it was--still--

59:19.560 --> 59:23.564
I still remember the pink,
uh... pajamas,

59:23.605 --> 59:27.526
you know, with the rabbits
on your feet.

59:29.111 --> 59:30.571
You were crying,

59:30.571 --> 59:34.908
and you were asking me
to help you, and I...

59:36.285 --> 59:37.995
couldn't do anything.

59:41.081 --> 59:42.791
So you just left.

59:42.833 --> 59:44.209
<i>You know,
you keep thinking</i>

59:44.251 --> 59:47.045
<i>it'd have been better
if I'd... stayed,</i>

59:47.087 --> 59:51.758
<i>but, uh, unhappy
and together's pretty ugly.</i>

59:51.800 --> 59:54.553
I had unhappy anyway.

59:54.595 --> 59:57.347
<i>I know, I--
- No!</i>

59:57.347 --> 59:59.558
<i>There's
no going back.</i>

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.519
<i>No, no, no, not back.
No, just, um...</i>

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:09.485
That's all I'm saying, right--
just right now.

01:00:10.527 --> 01:00:13.155
Are you asking me
to have hope?

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.409
Yeah.

01:00:28.212 --> 01:00:29.630
<i>Listen, don't cry.</i>

01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:31.673
<i>I'll do whatever
you want, okay?</i>

01:00:34.468 --> 01:00:37.638
I want you
to take care of me.

01:00:39.973 --> 01:00:41.725
<i>I want to be
nine years old,</i>

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:44.436
<i>and I want you
to take care of me.</i>

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:47.272
I'm sorry. I'm...

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:50.776
I'm very, very sorry.

01:00:57.032 --> 01:00:59.201
<i>Hey.</i>

01:01:01.328 --> 01:01:04.039
<i>Hey, listen,
I'm gonna come visit.</i>

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:06.667
<i>I'm gonna--
 I'm comin'!</i>

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.211
Well, I'm not gonna
cook a pot roast.

01:01:09.253 --> 01:01:11.713
You don't have
to do anything.

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:14.466
Um...

01:01:14.508 --> 01:01:17.511
I'll just come there
and, uh...

01:01:17.553 --> 01:01:20.472
I'll stay in a hotel,
and we'll...

01:01:20.472 --> 01:01:22.057
<i>you know,
I'll buy you dinner.</i>

01:01:22.057 --> 01:01:24.726
<i>We'll make dumb jokes, you know, like I do.
- Well--</i>

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.311
We'll try one day
and we'll see.

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:29.148
<i>Just because you're
swooping out of the darkness</i>

01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:31.984
<i>doesn't mean that everything
is getting better.</i>

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:35.112
No, no, yeah.
Yeah.

01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:36.655
<i>And Dad?
- Uh-huh?</i>

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.285
<i>If you don't show...</i>

01:01:41.326 --> 01:01:43.245
that's it.

01:01:43.287 --> 01:01:44.788
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.290
I mean...

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.626
that's it.

01:01:49.668 --> 01:01:51.253
I'm coming.

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:56.925
Okay.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:32.878
They're pretty,
aren't they?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.546
Yeah, they
got names?

01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:36.673
Nah.

01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:38.550
That wouldn't be fair.

01:02:38.592 --> 01:02:40.344
Fair?

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:41.845
Yeah, can't
name 'em all.

01:02:41.887 --> 01:02:43.180
What's your name?

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.306
Pigeon man.

01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:48.811
Everybody just calls me--
"Hey, pigeon man."

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:50.646
"What's up, pigeon man?"

01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:52.439
No, no,
your real name.

01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:54.525
I'm John.

01:02:54.566 --> 01:02:56.610
Paul.

01:03:00.072 --> 01:03:01.824
You ever have kids, Paul?

01:03:01.824 --> 01:03:03.325
Yeah, two boys.

01:03:03.325 --> 01:03:05.869
They were both killed
in Vietnam.

01:03:07.204 --> 01:03:09.373
Thinking about taking
a trip over there

01:03:09.373 --> 01:03:11.500
and find out what that
was all about.

01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:14.044
You know Antoine?

01:03:14.086 --> 01:03:15.921
I see him here
occasionally.

01:03:15.963 --> 01:03:17.756
I wouldn't say
I know him.

01:03:17.798 --> 01:03:19.800
Antoine's father,
he's not around,

01:03:19.842 --> 01:03:21.760
and the mother
works all the time,

01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:25.013
so he needs someone
to, uh, look out for him,

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:27.182
someone to talk to.

01:03:27.224 --> 01:03:29.059
You know,
he's a good kid,

01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:30.811
but he's
gonna go crazy

01:03:30.853 --> 01:03:33.147
in this p-park
if he's all alone.

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:35.983
Look, I don't know. I--
- Just someone to talk to.

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:37.526
That'd be nice,
wouldn't it?

01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:40.362
Yeah, it might be.

01:03:40.404 --> 01:03:43.323
Paul, I'm gonna give you
a thousand dollars.

01:03:43.365 --> 01:03:45.284
No, no, it's for the kid.

01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:48.120
It's, uh, it's
just for the boy.

01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:50.873
Um... ice cream,
comic books,

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:53.667
maybe you take him to the
movies sometime, you know.

01:03:56.753 --> 01:03:58.338
What kind of ice cream
does he like?

01:03:58.338 --> 01:04:02.551
He likes, uh, chocolate.
Probably likes everything.

01:04:02.593 --> 01:04:04.720
He likes the sprinkles on.

01:04:07.472 --> 01:04:09.183
Hey, thanks.

01:04:35.918 --> 01:04:38.587
Well, this is it.

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:47.888
You want to, um...

01:04:51.141 --> 01:04:54.186
take, uh, the ride
on the paddleboats?

01:04:57.314 --> 01:04:59.024
Okay? Okay.

01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:26.885
Hello?

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:33.892
<i>It's over.
I'm breaking up with you.</i>

01:05:33.934 --> 01:05:36.311
You're breaking up
with me?

01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:38.105
Yeah, I just did.

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:42.651
Johnny, don't you want
to think this over?

01:05:42.693 --> 01:05:45.445
<i>I'm not sure, you know,
bein' mean's really</i>

01:05:45.487 --> 01:05:48.448
<i>the right thing to do,
but feels kind of good.</i>

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:51.410
Well, fuck you!

01:05:51.451 --> 01:05:54.121
<i>You know, you don't
know how to love.</i>

01:05:54.163 --> 01:05:55.330
<i>You live in a prison.</i>

01:05:55.372 --> 01:05:56.832
I'm not listening.

01:05:56.832 --> 01:05:58.458
You tell it
to the warden.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.794
I'm over the fence
and heading for the trees.

01:06:00.836 --> 01:06:03.255
Fuck you, asshole!

01:06:09.803 --> 01:06:12.473
What was that?
- And fuck you, too!

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:15.100
We've got
something.

01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:17.519
Water.

01:06:17.519 --> 01:06:18.687
Lots of it.

01:06:18.729 --> 01:06:22.566
We've got MacArthur Park,
Echo Park...

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.492
T.G.& R., how may I
direct your call?

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:33.118
<i>Hi, Alice, it's me.</i>

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.703
<i>I was wondering, um...</i>

01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:37.414
<i>what you thought if,
um, we got back together.</i>

01:06:37.414 --> 01:06:40.042
<i>Did Cheryl get herpes?
I hope not from you.</i>

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.960
<i>Listen, I'm serious.
I'm changing.</i>

01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:44.338
<i>John,
you're a criminal.</i>

01:06:44.379 --> 01:06:45.797
Well, I'm not anymore.

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:47.716
When was the last time
you stole something?

01:06:47.716 --> 01:06:51.094
I, um, I-I-I--
Listen, listen.

01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:53.347
I have an opportunity.

01:06:53.347 --> 01:06:57.184
Think about this, uh--
quit that job,

01:06:57.226 --> 01:06:58.644
get on the airplane
with me.

01:06:58.685 --> 01:07:00.062
We'll go visit
our daughter.

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:03.398
<i>We can get back
together again, start over.</i>

01:07:03.398 --> 01:07:06.318
John... I haven't been

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.613
in a long-term relationship
in six years,

01:07:09.655 --> 01:07:12.699
and for a dollar
above minimum wage

01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:14.701
I am answering phones

01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:18.038
and bringing coffee
to people with real lives.

01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:21.083
<i>There is no such thing
as a new start.</i>

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.626
<i>It is not that easy.</i>

01:07:22.668 --> 01:07:24.086
I'm not sayin'
it's easy.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:26.713
I'm just--just saying
think about it.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.633
Don't worry, John.

01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:31.927
I'm not the only
lonely woman in town.

01:07:31.969 --> 01:07:34.221
You'll find someone
to starch your boxers.

01:07:34.263 --> 01:07:35.681
Good-bye.

01:07:45.732 --> 01:07:47.693
Wanna go back now?

01:07:47.734 --> 01:07:51.113
Yeah, but I'm tired
of pedaling, so...

01:07:51.155 --> 01:07:52.948
enjoy yourself,
all right?

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:56.285
I don't like you.
- I'm gonna have a sea nap.

01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:57.786
You don't like me?
- No.

01:07:57.828 --> 01:08:00.247
Well, like, how come
you paid, huh? Huh?

01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:02.666
You must like me.
Come on, what's not to like?

01:08:02.749 --> 01:08:04.835
You think I do,
but I honestly don't.

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:07.754
You don't have to like me,
'cause I just spent your money.

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:11.300
You send him on--
I'm ready.

01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:13.260
<i>Have you told
anybody I'm on this?</i>

01:08:13.302 --> 01:08:14.636
What? What are you
talking about?

01:08:14.678 --> 01:08:16.430
<i>Hey, I've been
on the horn, John.</i>

01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:19.975
<i>I know what's cooking out there,
and what's for dinner is you.</i>

01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:21.852
What are you
talking about?

01:08:21.894 --> 01:08:24.188
<i>How Jimmy
got to Manny.</i>

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:27.232
They intercepted his cell phone
and gunned him down, man.

01:08:27.274 --> 01:08:28.984
Somebody's
talking to Jimmy,

01:08:29.026 --> 01:08:30.861
which means that
somebody is on to you.

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:32.613
<i>How the fuck else
would they know</i>

01:08:32.613 --> 01:08:34.615
<i>how to get
to Manny's place?</i>

01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:37.618
My question for you is
how does Jimmy Espinosa know

01:08:37.618 --> 01:08:39.703
that you took his case?

01:08:40.953 --> 01:08:42.706
I don't know.

01:08:42.747 --> 01:08:45.292
Ohhh, John, you'd better
start talking, brother.

01:08:45.334 --> 01:08:48.504
You'd better start talking, or that's
the end of our romantic relationship.

01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:50.380
<i>Listen, man, I'm doing
this thing anonymous,</i>

01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:52.299
<i>but if they know who you are,
then they can find me.</i>

01:08:52.299 --> 01:08:54.343
And I'm so fucking sorry
about Manny, man,

01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:56.553
but I'll be more sorry
if I'm dead!

01:08:56.595 --> 01:08:59.848
<i>So my question for you is,
for the last time,</i>

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:02.142
<i>what's the motherfucking
loose end?</i>

01:09:09.983 --> 01:09:11.443
Leonard!

01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:16.823
Whoa! Aaah...

01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:18.075
Leonard!

01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:21.537
Leonard!

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:24.081
Aah!

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:30.420
Leonard.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:32.256
Leonard, I'm gonna
have to kill you.

01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:34.966
I won't say anything.
I promise not to talk.

01:09:35.008 --> 01:09:37.594
I'll make you talk.
There are rules, Leonard.

01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:40.430
I'm going
to visit my son!

01:09:40.471 --> 01:09:42.850
Here's Robbie.

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:45.144
Please, please.

01:09:56.864 --> 01:09:59.867
Okay, so Jimmy's got Leonard--
we know that,

01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:02.703
which means that he's getting
his nuts squeezed right now,

01:10:02.744 --> 01:10:04.496
which means he's
probably gonna talk,

01:10:04.538 --> 01:10:06.331
so why don't you
break it for me...

01:10:06.373 --> 01:10:09.042
How much
does he know?

01:10:09.084 --> 01:10:10.544
Nothin', just me.

01:10:10.586 --> 01:10:14.006
<i>Ohh, man, Jimmy's gonna be
mad when he finds you...</i>

01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:16.216
but you're confident.

01:10:16.258 --> 01:10:17.926
What you have up
your sleeve?

01:10:17.968 --> 01:10:20.095
I brought my costume
to the party.

01:10:20.095 --> 01:10:22.014
<i>Right, well,
last time I checked,</i>

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:23.849
the costume don't stop
no motherfucking bullets.

01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:25.267
<i>And even if you get
away with the money,</i>

01:10:25.309 --> 01:10:27.603
<i>he's going to kill you.
- He's not gonna go that far.</i>

01:10:27.644 --> 01:10:30.564
<i>He'll find you.
Florida isn't that far away, John.</i>

01:10:30.564 --> 01:10:32.483
<i>I'll handle it.</i>

01:10:32.524 --> 01:10:34.276
Hey, John,
do me a favor.

01:10:34.318 --> 01:10:35.944
Um, when they kill you,

01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:37.696
don't say my name,
please. Thanks.

01:10:37.738 --> 01:10:39.406
What name? Who?

01:10:39.448 --> 01:10:41.950
<i>That's my boy.
Good luck.</i>

01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:43.202
Good luck.

01:11:07.351 --> 01:11:09.311
<i>T.G.& R., how may I
direct your call?</i>

01:11:09.353 --> 01:11:11.188
Alice, I love you.

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:13.065
Uh, Alice is on break.

01:11:27.788 --> 01:11:29.081
Hello?

01:11:29.122 --> 01:11:30.415
Alice...

01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:33.627
I want us
to get married again.

01:11:35.212 --> 01:11:38.799
John...
I'm flattered.

01:11:38.841 --> 01:11:41.009
<i>Listen, I'm putting
my life on the line.</i>

01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:43.428
I want you to be
straight with me, okay?

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:45.472
Just--just tell me
the truth.

01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:50.477
I don't think that I've got the
patience to do it with you.

01:11:50.519 --> 01:11:53.814
Uh--are you still
doing those personal ads?

01:11:57.693 --> 01:11:59.611
I knew it!

01:11:59.653 --> 01:12:01.113
Did you find
somebody else?

01:12:01.155 --> 01:12:02.656
<i>That's none
of your business.</i>

01:12:02.698 --> 01:12:05.576
Well, whoever it is,
I bet you I'm better than him.

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:08.328
'Cause you know me.
You know what you're gettin'.

01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:11.081
But with, uh, you know,
Computer Jim, who knows?

01:12:11.081 --> 01:12:13.750
<i>His name is Ralph.
- Oh, even better. Ralph.</i>

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:16.670
So Ralph is exciting,
Ralph is new.

01:12:16.712 --> 01:12:18.547
Ooh, sex with Ralph!

01:12:18.547 --> 01:12:20.757
<i>We've barely kissed.
- Yeah, you see?</i>

01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:21.842
That's exactly my point.

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:24.094
So you cling
to these little fantasies

01:12:24.094 --> 01:12:26.263
about what he might be
and who he might be

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:28.474
and how he might do it,
and then--

01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:30.184
<i>and then new love
drives you to find</i>

01:12:30.225 --> 01:12:31.894
<i>those little
idiosyncrasies,</i>

01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:34.855
<i>those little broken edges
that only you can fix,</i>

01:12:34.938 --> 01:12:37.149
but after a year or two
the newness wears off,

01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:39.651
and there's still
so many broken pieces,

01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:42.446
so much to figure out,
and then what've you got?

01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:47.826
What?

01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:50.204
You got me.
You got me!

01:12:50.245 --> 01:12:52.956
Huh? But now
it's two years later.

01:12:52.998 --> 01:12:54.625
You're two years older,

01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:57.252
two years of fixing
somebody else's broken edges,

01:12:57.294 --> 01:12:58.962
then two more years
with Dave

01:12:59.004 --> 01:13:00.589
and two more years
with Wayne.

01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:02.257
<i>And maybe--
what at the end?</i>

01:13:02.299 --> 01:13:03.842
<i>Who's to say
you want to go on?</i>

01:13:03.884 --> 01:13:06.345
Maybe Ralph's edges
will be easier.

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:07.930
<i>Yeah, maybe
they'll be worse.</i>

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:10.432
Well, maybe I'll
just find out.

01:13:10.432 --> 01:13:12.851
Maybe... Ralph
won't wanna play.

01:13:12.893 --> 01:13:15.729
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:20.025
Or...

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:22.486
or you can have me,
right now.

01:13:22.528 --> 01:13:24.655
I'm standin' here.

01:13:24.655 --> 01:13:27.533
<i>I'm--I'm tellin' you
you got everything.</i>

01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:29.535
Is someone sayin'
that to you right now,

01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:31.578
anywhere else--
you got everything?

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:36.959
You can't convince me.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.836
A relationship, John,

01:13:38.877 --> 01:13:43.090
<i>is not a decision--
it's a process.</i>

01:13:43.131 --> 01:13:44.132
<i>Listen, listen,</i>

01:13:44.174 --> 01:13:45.884
<i>those little statements,
they sound nice,</i>

01:13:45.926 --> 01:13:47.553
but what about
your feelings, okay?

01:13:47.594 --> 01:13:49.054
We're talking about
a middle-aged woman

01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:50.472
who's got a computer date
named Ralph

01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:51.849
that she doesn't
even wanna kiss.

01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:53.350
<i>Now, I know
you're unhappy.</i>

01:13:53.392 --> 01:13:54.768
<i>Okay, I can make--
- That's--</i>

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.062
<i>I know you're lonely.
- That's not very nice.</i>

01:13:57.104 --> 01:13:59.106
I can take care of you.

01:13:59.106 --> 01:14:01.066
Let me take care of you.

01:14:01.108 --> 01:14:03.402
No.

01:14:28.927 --> 01:14:32.097
Do you love me?

01:14:38.562 --> 01:14:41.064
When you...

01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:43.859
after I talk to you,
I feel good.

01:14:49.323 --> 01:14:53.035
What? What is it?

01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:55.412
I'm just so happy
you didn't say you love me,

01:14:55.454 --> 01:14:57.873
'cause you didn't lie.

01:14:57.873 --> 01:15:00.167
No, no, I--

01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:03.545
I do love you
when I hear you laughing.

01:15:03.587 --> 01:15:06.965
No, just save it--
save it--save it for later.

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:10.260
Later.
So--so you wanna...

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:13.138
wanna try?

01:15:14.681 --> 01:15:17.100
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:21.688
<i>Uh, let's talk
more tonight.</i>

01:15:21.772 --> 01:15:23.398
<i>I'm gonna
go home now.</i>

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.484
No, don't--
don't go home. Come here.

01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:27.486
Um, we'll go
to the airport together.

01:15:27.528 --> 01:15:30.447
We'll go to Florida
and go visit our daughter.

01:15:30.489 --> 01:15:32.825
But my job...

01:15:32.866 --> 01:15:34.743
<i>Nah, you don't need
that job.</i>

01:15:34.743 --> 01:15:36.453
<i>Just come get me.
I'm in Echo Park.</i>

01:15:36.495 --> 01:15:40.415
There's a--a temple
across the street.

01:15:40.457 --> 01:15:41.792
You know it?

01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:45.337
<i>Right now?
- Yeah.</i>

01:15:45.337 --> 01:15:48.173
<i>You're serious.
- Yeah.</i>

01:15:48.215 --> 01:15:50.968
Meet me in the back.

01:15:52.928 --> 01:15:54.304
Okay.

01:15:57.141 --> 01:15:59.143
<i>I'll be there.</i>

01:15:59.184 --> 01:16:01.145
I'll be there, too.

01:16:19.288 --> 01:16:21.373
Mommy, no!

01:16:40.184 --> 01:16:44.021
Do you want to put your
case on the bench?

01:16:44.104 --> 01:16:46.482
I'll examine it
for 15 seconds.

01:16:46.523 --> 01:16:49.067
If I approve,
I'll put my bag on the bench,

01:16:49.109 --> 01:16:52.070
and you'll have 15 seconds
to look at the money.

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:55.073
After that, I take
your case and go.

01:16:55.115 --> 01:16:59.453
But if you deviate from
the plan, the deal is off,

01:16:59.495 --> 01:17:00.954
and any kind
of protection

01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:03.165
my presence may
have afforded you

01:17:03.207 --> 01:17:05.501
will evaporate.

01:17:09.213 --> 01:17:11.256
You got one minute
to start.

01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:31.235
No?

01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:42.538
Are you Jimmy Espinosa?

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:48.293
You have 30 seconds.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:53.507
How do I know you're
not a trigger man?

01:17:55.592 --> 01:17:58.428
You're not dead.

01:17:58.428 --> 01:18:01.473
It'll be my ass when I put
my case on the bench--

01:18:01.473 --> 01:18:03.267
you look at it,
you like what you see,

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.685
and then shoot me.

01:18:06.645 --> 01:18:09.356
Do I look like
a trigger man?

01:18:09.398 --> 01:18:12.109
I don't know,
you look like a...

01:18:12.151 --> 01:18:14.862
Well, pretty mean.

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:23.412
How many men
you got in the park?

01:18:29.293 --> 01:18:31.211
I'll be going.

01:18:31.253 --> 01:18:33.088
The hell you will.

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:34.965
Well, why won't I?

01:18:35.007 --> 01:18:36.800
I got what you want.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.094
Could take it.

01:18:39.136 --> 01:18:41.346
Maybe, maybe not.

01:18:41.346 --> 01:18:44.349
Gotta be worried
about a guy like this,

01:18:44.349 --> 01:18:45.684
a guy who could
pull off a job

01:18:45.726 --> 01:18:48.145
that you wouldn't even
think about attempting.

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:50.189
You gotta be careful.

01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:52.733
Maybe he's got friends
you don't know about.

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:57.905
Maybe he's just lucky.

01:18:57.946 --> 01:19:00.199
His partner--
gunned down today.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.451
All is not pleasure
in paradise.

01:19:04.369 --> 01:19:06.830
Your time's up.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.460
Jimmy, how's
your mother?

01:19:17.299 --> 01:19:19.009
Resting in peace.

01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.595
Bet she is.

01:19:22.471 --> 01:19:23.806
Give me my money.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.624
You seem
disappointed.

01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:56.421
All there.

01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:59.716
But you don't
feel changed.

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:01.426
You thought
maybe, what,

01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:03.053
a weight
would be lifted,

01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:05.222
sky would be brighter,
something?

01:20:05.264 --> 01:20:07.683
You thought paper
would do that for you.

01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:16.567
Maybe it will.

01:20:34.668 --> 01:20:36.211
Or not.

01:21:24.843 --> 01:21:27.805
He's got a gun!

01:21:27.846 --> 01:21:30.724
Get down! He's got a gun.

01:24:04.628 --> 01:24:07.840
Ow! Aah.

01:24:07.881 --> 01:24:10.008
Hey! Hey, freeze!

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:12.344
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!

01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:14.471
John! You all right?

01:24:14.555 --> 01:24:15.889
Come on.

01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:19.685
You okay? No.
- I gotta go.

01:24:19.726 --> 01:24:21.645
No.
- Hey.

01:24:21.645 --> 01:24:23.522
Cover these guys.

01:24:24.773 --> 01:24:26.942
No, no, no, no.
You wanna get shot?

01:24:26.984 --> 01:24:29.153
Go. Go.
- It's okay.

01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:30.779
Kid?

01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:33.240
Kid, move.

01:24:33.323 --> 01:24:35.742
Go. Go!

01:24:43.375 --> 01:24:45.002
Hey, there's money
on the ground!

01:24:45.043 --> 01:24:46.003
Oh, my God.

01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:02.728
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:25:02.769 --> 01:25:04.271
Easy! John is
gonna be fine.

01:25:04.313 --> 01:25:05.606
He's gonna be fine.

01:25:27.753 --> 01:25:29.171
Get in the car!

01:25:54.655 --> 01:25:55.531
Are you okay?

01:25:55.531 --> 01:25:57.491
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just drive.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.245
Oh, um...

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:04.331
Oh, my God.

01:26:25.394 --> 01:26:27.104
Do I need to get
you anywhere?

01:26:27.146 --> 01:26:28.313
Oh, I don't know--

01:26:28.355 --> 01:26:30.774
I think we just go
to the airport, don't you?

01:26:30.816 --> 01:26:33.193
You sure?
- Yeah, that's okay.

01:26:33.193 --> 01:26:35.571
That's okay.
- Airport it is.

01:26:35.612 --> 01:26:37.531
Florida.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.910
What are you
laughing about?

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:44.329
The easy part
was getting to the car.

01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:45.914
Yeah?
What's the hard part?

01:26:47.374 --> 01:26:49.334
Whatever happens next.

01:27:45.808 --> 01:27:50.646
# I don't believe in fate #

01:27:52.272 --> 01:27:58.070
# I don't believe in magic #

01:27:58.111 --> 01:28:00.906
# But I believe I #

01:28:00.948 --> 01:28:03.617
# Will wait for you #

01:28:03.617 --> 01:28:08.372
# Till the road
beneath my feet #

01:28:10.082 --> 01:28:14.294
# Takes me to your door #

01:28:15.754 --> 01:28:21.135
# And I will not retreat #

01:28:21.176 --> 01:28:26.515
# Till we are we once more #

01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:40.988
# Like some conquistador #

01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:48.912
# I sought new worlds
to plunder #

01:28:48.912 --> 01:28:54.751
# Standing upon
a far-off shore #

01:28:54.793 --> 01:28:59.756
# I long for distant lands #

01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:05.137
# That I left long ago #

01:29:06.597 --> 01:29:11.518
# But my riches are the sand #

01:29:12.644 --> 01:29:17.691
# Till we are we once more #

01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:50.849
# Till the road
beneath my feet #

01:29:52.017 --> 01:29:57.231
# Takes me to your door #

01:29:58.524 --> 01:30:02.986
# I will not retreat #

01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:08.826
# Till we are we once more #

01:30:09.868 --> 01:30:10.911
