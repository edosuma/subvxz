00:49.350 --> 00:51.552
- You ever been down
south to Alabama,

00:51.552 --> 00:53.587
Louisiana, Mississippi?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.923
- Never been that way before.

00:55.923 --> 00:59.026
- You ever seen
Helen Keller's house?

01:00.027 --> 01:01.395
- Helen Keller's house?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.430
- Yeah, you ever seen it?

01:02.430 --> 01:03.497
- No, can't say I have.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.998
- Neither has she.

01:06.834 --> 01:07.793
- Not bad.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.138
- Run, run!

01:10.138 --> 01:11.138
Go, go, go!

01:16.677 --> 01:17.811
- Don't stop, don't stop!
- They're trailing us,

01:17.811 --> 01:18.746
don't stop!

01:18.746 --> 01:21.482
- Oh my God, don't stop, run!

01:21.482 --> 01:22.316
- Bill.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.586
- It's Pete, but that works.

01:27.921 --> 01:32.193
- Fuckin' demon!

01:32.193 --> 01:33.026
- I'll be.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.265
What do you reckon
they're doin'?

01:37.265 --> 01:38.866
- I don't know.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.376
Let's go get 'em.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.710
- Let's do it.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.117
- Jesus fuck, huh!

02:34.888 --> 02:38.826
- What in the hell
done happened here?

02:38.826 --> 02:42.129
Sheriff, where's the other one?

02:42.129 --> 02:43.631
Where's the girl?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.369
- I don't know but
that ain't right.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.940
- That looks like Taco Bell.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.116
- Jesus.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.920
Lopez, get us
close to the house.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.188
- Sir, we're right over them.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.958
If I get any closer,
they're gonna hear it.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.827
- Zinmen, zoom in and resolve.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.095
- Zoomin' in.

03:15.095 --> 03:18.332
- Oh my God, it looks
like they were mangled

03:18.332 --> 03:19.800
by some kind of animal.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.735
Does anybody see any dogs?

03:21.735 --> 03:24.772
- Zinmen, launch those
other two drones.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.006
Find 'em.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.275
- Launching now.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.185
- Lieutenant Carr,

03:39.553 --> 03:41.154
Lieutenant Carr?

03:42.523 --> 03:43.557
Lieutenant Carr?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.026
Lieutenant Carr!

03:57.170 --> 03:58.939
I'm Commander Jacobs.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.117
- I gave up my bars
a long time ago, sir.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.856
- Lieutenant, how would you
feel about getting out of here?

04:15.856 --> 04:18.058
- You got some C4?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.860
- I got a deal.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.962
- I'd rather take the C4.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.534
- Would you be so kind as
to fetch the Lieutenant here

04:26.534 --> 04:27.601
some aspirin?

04:29.303 --> 04:31.204
He sure could use some.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.408
Oh, you are a drowning man.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.312
- Oh, and what
does that make you?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.683
- The son of a bitch
with a life raft.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.051
You're caught in
some evil currents,

04:44.051 --> 04:46.186
and you'll be dead in a year.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.621
- Is that a fact?

04:49.022 --> 04:50.257
- Yeah.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.260
Evil always destroys
itself in the end.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.000
- What is this, a
fucking intervention?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.502
- It's a job offer.

05:04.938 --> 05:05.773
- Well,

05:07.908 --> 05:09.610
I'm not lookin' for
a second chance.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.580
- The Navy doesn't give 'em.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.948
Jack County, Texas.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.684
You ever heard of it?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.086
- Nope.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.454
- I'm not surprised.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.691
It's barely a shit stain
on the ass of Texas.

05:23.691 --> 05:27.861
But there is a little town
there with a big problem.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.063
Men are being slaughtered,

05:30.063 --> 05:32.433
and young women are
being kidnapped.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.767
Daily, it seems.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.470
- Really?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.706
How many?

05:38.706 --> 05:40.207
- Dozens,

05:40.207 --> 05:41.775
hundreds maybe.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.177
We're not really sure.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.715
Most local authorities have
been killed, so, you know,

05:47.715 --> 05:50.751
the rest are too scared to talk.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.586
- So call in the Feds.

05:54.154 --> 05:58.225
- People are dying,
Lieutenant, and you can help.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.296
- Are the cartels killin' 'em?

06:14.141 --> 06:17.144
- This is where it
gets complicated.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.651
There are local legends
of paranormal activity

06:23.651 --> 06:25.085
in Jack County.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.759
- What, like ghosts?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.127
- Like demons.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.035
- Are you serious, sir?

06:42.035 --> 06:45.372
With all due respect, fuck you.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.475
As you can see, I'm sleepin'
off a hangover here,

06:47.475 --> 06:48.942
and I don't have time--

06:48.942 --> 06:52.746
- Demons, and we think
that they are responsible.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.583
- Demons or not,

06:56.784 --> 06:59.887
this has already gotta
be all over the news.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.623
- Well, they're targeting
a small population.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.292
Majority of 'em are
Mexican immigrants.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.995
Down there another dead
illegal isn't news,

07:07.995 --> 07:09.763
it's a victory.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.771
- Why do you care
so much about this?

07:19.473 --> 07:21.008
- Well, we don't really,

07:21.008 --> 07:24.011
but we can't have
this thing spread.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.913
Because if it is real,

07:25.913 --> 07:28.982
and as bizarre as
it sounds, it just,

07:31.184 --> 07:35.255
the threat needs to be
contained and neutralized.

07:36.557 --> 07:40.393
- You wanna throw me
in the meat grinder?

07:40.393 --> 07:44.565
So, that being said, this
must be a black operation.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.100
- No support,

07:48.435 --> 07:50.604
no backup, and undercover.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.174
If your identity gets out
while you're on the job,

07:54.174 --> 07:58.211
then the DOD will deny any
knowledge of your employment.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.713
You know the deal.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.650
- Who else knows about this?

08:02.650 --> 08:06.920
- A few others at Langley,
and of course the Pentagon.

08:06.920 --> 08:11.058
- How many of these
things are we up against?

08:11.058 --> 08:12.459
- No idea.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.910
- If I do this,

08:33.413 --> 08:35.816
I've got a couple conditions.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.754
- Within reason, I'm
sure we can accommodate.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.158
- Fuck it.

08:46.093 --> 08:46.927
Let's go.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.448
- You okay over there?

09:08.448 --> 09:12.119
- Yeah, sure.

09:14.287 --> 09:18.726
- Hey, uh, you
mind helpin' a guy out?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.960
- With what?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.730
- Well, it
seems like, uh,

09:24.865 --> 09:27.267
whoever stocks this thing
doesn't do a very good job,

09:27.267 --> 09:28.936
let's just say that.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.506
- Here ya go.

09:33.506 --> 09:34.507
- Thank you.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.909
- Don't sweat it.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.785
- Hey, hurry up!

09:47.621 --> 09:50.157
- I'm
comin', damn it!

10:02.035 --> 10:03.036
- Excuse me.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.479
Meet me out back.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.650
- Hurry up, up, up!

10:16.650 --> 10:19.887
- We gotta
leave immediately.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.321
- Let me get my bag.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.757
- Hold on, you don't
know the whole story yet.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.359
- Since when did old
Whiskey Sauce give a fuck?

10:26.359 --> 10:28.361
- Well, since never, but

10:32.265 --> 10:33.967
you need to listen up.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.468
- Listen nothin'.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.305
- We may not be
up against humans.

10:40.808 --> 10:45.412
- Humans, babies, hamsters,
it's all the same to me.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.246
- Fuckin'

10:48.882 --> 10:50.984
possible paranormal shit.

10:54.254 --> 10:58.425
- Then I'll be a
motherfuckin' ghost buster.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.097
- You believe in God, Whisk?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.002
- Shit.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.504
- 'Cause that's what
we're up against.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.974
If these things exist,

11:13.974 --> 11:15.809
is half-god, half-man.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.983
- Well, you know
I believe in God.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.151
You know that.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.687
But I can't fight no gods.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.426
But I'm a God-fearing man.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.427
God fearing.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.431
- Demons, Whisk.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.736
That's what's got this town.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.372
- Ain't no motherfuckin' demons.

11:45.372 --> 11:49.943
A bunch of redneck,
lynchin', meth smokers maybe.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.213
- Yeah.

11:55.515 --> 11:59.152
But the Bible says
there are demons.

11:59.152 --> 11:59.987
- Yeah.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.157
Jesus visited a
town, Gergesenes,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.095
saved a man possessed by demons.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.899
But in the flesh, man, uh,

12:15.368 --> 12:17.370
we all got our own demons.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.039
You should know that.

12:19.039 --> 12:19.873
- Yeah.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.778
And Jesus asked him,
"What is your name?"

12:24.778 --> 12:28.615
- And they replied,
"Legion, for we are many."

12:30.784 --> 12:32.986
You've learned a thing
or two, haven't you?

12:32.986 --> 12:35.588
- Let's go save a town.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.591
- Let's save a town from
some motherfucking demons.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.562
- Come on.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.573
- Oh, fuck me.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.710
Pull up, man.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.248
This is bullshit.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.749
- What's bullshit?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.254
- Did y'all know y'all were
fuckin' comin' to get me?

13:07.254 --> 13:08.155
- Yes.
- Huh?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.789
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.224
Y'all couldn't have
gotten a bigger truck

13:11.224 --> 13:12.492
or vehicle or somethin'?

13:12.492 --> 13:13.927
They don't issue trucks no more?

13:13.927 --> 13:16.563
Man, I can't even put
my fuckin' feet down.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.931
- Do you need me to move up?

13:17.931 --> 13:19.032
- Nah, nah, it ain't gonna help.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.567
My foot's already in your ass.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.768
You know what I mean?
- Then fuckin' suffer

13:21.768 --> 13:22.870
in silence, bitch.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.437
- Oh, now I gotta be a bitch.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.805
I'm just sayin', man,

13:25.805 --> 13:27.007
how far are we?
- You could always be back

13:27.007 --> 13:28.475
in there fuckin'
scrubbin' shitters.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.243
- Okay, I like this better
than that, but still.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.545
- How the fuck did you
wind up there anyway?

13:39.119 --> 13:43.490
- You look like you
need a bath, cocksucker.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.659
- Yeah, well, I've been
workin' on my black face.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.661
Gonna join me the NAACP.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.900
See, I figure a little grease
on my face, some watermelon,

13:52.900 --> 13:55.168
I'll fit right in
with you, brother.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.937
- Til you take those pants off,

13:56.937 --> 14:00.007
and then they gonna
all know the truth.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.808
- Yes, they will, Whiskey Sauce.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.176
Yes, they will!

14:03.176 --> 14:04.677
- What's up, Red?
- Ah, it's good to see you,

14:04.677 --> 14:05.512
brother.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.447
It's good to see you.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.748
- Sir.

14:08.748 --> 14:09.883
- How you doin', Red?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.651
- None of that Red shit.

14:11.651 --> 14:15.222
- Yeah, by the looks of that
chin, it should be white.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.290
- I just go by Ander now.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.692
- Ander?

14:20.693 --> 14:21.694
Fair enough.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.397
Looks like you're
doin' really well

14:24.397 --> 14:27.267
for yourself here, Ander.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.936
Real good actually.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.071
- I'm doin' all right.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.943
Who's the suit?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.581
- That's Commander Jacobs.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.617
- Damn, sir, hot
as balls out here.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.287
Got ya wearin' your monkey suit.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.391
So clearly the
brotherhood's all here.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.694
- Didn't know you
had company, baby.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.796
- Thanks, baby.
- There ya go.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.631
- Y'all got mouths.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.333
Use 'em, why ya here?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.537
- I've got a
proposition for you.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.539
- Oh, I just bet you do.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.542
One last mission.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.144
- You know, I had
my last mission.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.845
I don't need another one.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.482
- Well, this one's different.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.316
This one

15:18.318 --> 15:19.953
will top 'em all.

15:19.953 --> 15:24.024
- Yeah, and I've never
heard that before.

15:24.024 --> 15:24.857
- Look,

15:27.694 --> 15:29.796
I need you on this.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.831
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.701
This is an opportunity
for a new start,

15:34.701 --> 15:37.037
for me to make things right.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.341
- Well, I don't
need a fresh start.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.376
Look, I'm done, guys.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.912
I did my time, I got
out for a reason.

15:45.912 --> 15:46.980
I'm stayin' out.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.582
- Nobody's askin' ya back in.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.419
Hell, nobody will
let you back in.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.589
This is for us.

15:57.824 --> 15:58.658
- Us?

15:59.959 --> 16:00.727
- Yes, us.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.865
- What, 'cause Bear, Lopez,
they weren't available?

16:13.173 --> 16:16.076
- At least take a
look at the file.

16:24.017 --> 16:24.851
- Demons?

16:29.289 --> 16:32.592
- That's what they're
saying down in Texas.

16:32.592 --> 16:37.064
- Oh, I would love to see
the op order on this one.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.866
- It'll be all plain clothes,

16:39.866 --> 16:41.534
undercover.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.536
- So what is your cover?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.239
- That's the thing.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.575
It's our call.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.278
- Really?

16:51.278 --> 16:52.112
- Mm-hmm.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.382
- What do ya say, Ander?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.285
- Call me Red.

17:12.865 --> 17:13.733
- They're in.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.602
You owe me 50 bucks.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.975
- I need a fill up
on the bikes outside.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.513
- Where ya headed?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.681
- Jack County.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.184
- What's your business there?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.119
- Don't worry about it.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.056
I'll take, uh,

19:51.090 --> 19:52.992
three of these.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.495
- You don't wanna step
foot on that land, mister.

19:55.495 --> 19:59.198
Ain't nothin' there
to protect you.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.834
- Why do I need protectin'?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.337
- God left those
parts a long time ago.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.106
What's left ain't
fit for no man.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.543
- Keep the change.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.355
- IDs, let me see some IDs!

21:01.561 --> 21:03.129
Come on.

21:10.169 --> 21:14.341
You know, things can turn
real difficult real fast.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.780
- Hey, we ain't
done nothin' wrong.

21:23.716 --> 21:24.884
- Your mirror.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.487
- What about it?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.325
- It's broken.
- Hey!

21:32.325 --> 21:33.159
- Hey!

21:36.729 --> 21:40.299
Y'all just calm down
and have a good night.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.104
And get this fixed.

21:54.981 --> 21:55.815
- Officer.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.618
- Howdy.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.867
- Well, there's no
sense in wastin' time.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.869
Red, grab us some rooms.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.340
I'm gonna head over next door
and check out the locals.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.608
- You got it.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.277
- All right, well
meet back at 23:00.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.025
- You want something?

23:48.327 --> 23:50.396
- Yeah, I'll take a beer.

23:52.499 --> 23:53.766
- A beer.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.750
So, where are you from?

24:13.653 --> 24:18.257
- Look, hon, unless this
is a speed dating service,

24:18.257 --> 24:20.259
I ain't lookin' to chat.

24:21.628 --> 24:22.729
- Hmph, 3.50.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.298
- That's what I thought.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.239
Keep the change.

24:35.374 --> 24:36.609
- Yeah, thanks.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.419
You like what you see?

24:51.390 --> 24:54.060
- To be honest, she looks bored.

24:56.696 --> 25:00.399
- Well, new girls, they
never know how to work it.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.635
It doesn't matter
how big the room,

25:02.635 --> 25:04.704
or how many high rollers.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.739
They're all pigs.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.307
You have a cock,

25:08.307 --> 25:12.144
and I, and
two dynamite titties.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.914
I can work them so good,
the fuckin' king of Espania

25:14.914 --> 25:18.718
will oink and drop down his
diamonds in my G-string.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.553
That's how it's done.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.261
No, no, no,

25:29.261 --> 25:31.664
save your money
for the main event.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.099
This one's on me.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.486

27:34.486 --> 27:36.222

27:41.393 --> 27:42.228
Hmm?

27:43.162 --> 27:45.031
- Yeah, somethin' like that.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.766
- Something like that.

27:51.537 --> 27:54.941
- What do ya think's got
this town so on edge?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.382
- Demons.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.773
- Damn, baby.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.975
- Careful, Rafa, or I'll
spill these fucking drinks.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.409
- Why don't you put
those drinks down

28:30.409 --> 28:31.778
and give me a free one?

28:31.778 --> 28:33.612
- Why don't you go back
to your fucking homies.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.714
You don't get a free one.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.516
- Come on, baby.

28:37.516 --> 28:38.785
I need you.

28:38.785 --> 28:41.153
- Fuck off, Rafa, I'm
not a fucking hooker.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.321
- I didn't say you were.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.689
Come on, baby, just please--

28:43.689 --> 28:45.792
- No, get the fuck away from me.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.726
- Come on, baby.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.062
Well, well, Mr. Gas Station.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.432
Where your friends at?

28:53.432 --> 28:54.867
- This guy bothering you?

28:54.867 --> 28:57.336
- You, you should leave.

28:57.336 --> 29:01.473
- Yeah, you heard
that, you should leave.

29:01.473 --> 29:02.809
- Don't do that.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.378
- We got a problem here, Jefe?

29:07.713 --> 29:11.383
- I don't know, do we
got a fuckin' problem?

29:11.383 --> 29:14.787
- Hey, Carlos, check
out homeboy over here.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.081
- I'm here to help.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.149
- Let him go.

29:52.758 --> 29:54.793
Get this man a drink

29:54.793 --> 29:57.463
and a round of beer for my guys.

29:58.898 --> 29:59.731
So,

30:01.133 --> 30:02.134
who are you?

30:05.071 --> 30:06.638
- Friends.

30:06.638 --> 30:10.442
- Friends?

30:10.442 --> 30:12.879
Is this how friends behave?

30:12.879 --> 30:15.047
Where you from, my friend?

30:16.949 --> 30:18.117
- Out of town.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.055
- Yeah, that much we know.

30:25.457 --> 30:26.859
Why are you here?

30:29.395 --> 30:30.329
- Vacation.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.764
- Hmm, vacation.

30:36.903 --> 30:41.573
Now why would you ever go on
vacation to a place like this?

30:41.573 --> 30:43.275
- You don't.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.610
- No, you don't.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.556
- You have a good night.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.857
- Yeah.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.108
- Fuck, every fuckin' time.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.311
- Shut the
fuck up, Whiskey.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.375
- Hey!

32:07.326 --> 32:08.494
- No cops yet.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.431
All that gunfire, no response.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.667
Either there's no
one left alive,

32:15.667 --> 32:17.903
or they're too damn scared.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.406
Agent Barnes, you
awake back there?

32:20.406 --> 32:21.940
- Yes, sir.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.543
- Make an anonymous call
to the sheriff's office.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.978
Get 'em over there.

32:25.978 --> 32:28.947
Maybe one of 'em is still alive.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.119
- Still nothing.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.155
- Ivanova,

32:37.823 --> 32:41.593
there are more things
in the Heaven and Earth

32:41.593 --> 32:44.730
than dreamt in all
your philosophy.

32:44.730 --> 32:45.564
- Sir?

32:47.533 --> 32:50.002
- Yes, there's a chance.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.204
- The battery
life's at 48%, sir.

32:52.204 --> 32:53.472
If we put a recon
unit on the ground,

32:53.472 --> 32:55.407
we can get all the
intel that we need.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.943
- Not enough time, Ping.

32:57.943 --> 33:01.080
All right, Lopez, let's
get her out of there.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.649
Find a thermal,
climb to 500 feet.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.017
- Sir, I understand
you want to ascend,

33:05.017 --> 33:05.984
but this particular UV is--

33:05.984 --> 33:08.154
- Agent, 500 feet, please.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.357
- Ascending 500 feet.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.093
- Turbos off,

33:14.093 --> 33:15.594
and we're gliding.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.131
- All right, Lopez,
start your turns.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.566
- Yes, sir.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.204
Nothing, sir.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.207
- Wait, right there.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.441
Right here, you got that?

33:29.441 --> 33:30.609
- Yes, sir.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.647
- All right, how many
sites are we connected to?

33:35.647 --> 33:36.615
- Nine.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.217
- All right,

33:38.217 --> 33:42.854
switch servers, have all
911 calls routed through us.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.224
Let's do it now, folks.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.900
- Let's get him on
the bar, on the bar!

33:54.900 --> 33:56.302
Get some rags.
- We gotta stop the bleeding!

33:56.302 --> 33:57.636
Go, go, go, get him on there!

33:57.636 --> 33:58.937
- Come on, I got you.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.506
Let's get you on top.

34:00.506 --> 34:01.740
Over there.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.741
- Yeah, you're gonna
be all right, man.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.310
- All right, just relax.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.744
Where Rafa, Rafa!

34:05.744 --> 34:07.746
- Danny!
- Come on stay with us, homes,

34:07.746 --> 34:08.679
stay with us.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.081
Stay with us, homie, come on.

34:10.081 --> 34:10.748
Stop the bleeding!
- I can't stop the fuckin'

34:10.748 --> 34:11.917
bleeding, man!

34:11.917 --> 34:13.284
Fuck it don't stop, man!
- This whole rag.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.954
- Come on, man.
- Stay with me, stay with me.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.223
- Come on!

34:17.223 --> 34:18.056
- Come on!

34:19.225 --> 34:20.525
Fuck.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.630
Jefe.

34:30.835 --> 34:31.770
- Let's go.

34:32.904 --> 34:33.739
Let's go.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.676
- Fuck!

34:40.279 --> 34:42.348
- Fuckin' motherfucker.

34:45.751 --> 34:46.585
Fuck!

34:50.889 --> 34:52.291
- Is this a joke?

34:55.860 --> 35:00.599
Does she smell like Eve
before she bit the apple?

35:00.599 --> 35:04.403
Her flesh has been seduced
and no longer pure.

35:07.105 --> 35:11.543
These mistakes, your
stupidity is hindering us

35:11.543 --> 35:13.945
from our rise.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.783
Now, we can't let such
temptation go to waste,

35:20.386 --> 35:21.753
can we?

35:38.270 --> 35:40.439
- Somethin' broke?

35:40.439 --> 35:43.275
- Nah, I just felt
like wrenchin'.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.712
- Couldn't sleep
either, could ya?

35:46.712 --> 35:49.381
- Could you with Commander
Snore-A-Lot in there?

35:49.381 --> 35:52.551
Take this fuckin' wrench and
shove it in his eye socket.

36:00.359 --> 36:03.729
- Something's got this
town spooked, man.

36:06.865 --> 36:10.469
- What, there's a party and
old Whiskey wasn't invited?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.137
- Nothin'
like that, Whisk.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.639
Just thinkin' of
ways to kill ya,

36:13.639 --> 36:15.541
so I can get some rack time.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.691
- Let's move.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.026
- Door, the door!

37:44.896 --> 37:46.732
Get her inside, get her inside!

37:46.732 --> 37:47.566
Go!

38:06.518 --> 38:07.986
- He sees us.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.287
- Yeah.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.228
- Could somebody get me a
cup of real coffee, please?

38:17.228 --> 38:18.864
Not of that ass-sweat,
decaf bullshit

38:18.864 --> 38:20.799
that you assholes make.

38:21.833 --> 38:22.668
Thank you.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.637
- Zinmen, get us closer.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.539
- We're at 22% now, sir.

38:27.539 --> 38:28.740
If we get any lower,

38:28.740 --> 38:30.208
we're not gonna be
able to make it back.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.411
- Your coffee, sir.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.880
- Right, ascending 200 feet,

38:34.880 --> 38:35.714
300 feet,

38:37.182 --> 38:38.016
400 feet.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.152
- We lost power.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.320
Battery's gone.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.355
- It's done.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.908
- We can put astronauts

39:06.177 --> 39:07.579
into outer space,

39:09.014 --> 39:09.848
the moon,

39:12.418 --> 39:15.754
shit, probably even
one day other Earths

39:17.623 --> 39:20.225
and other galaxies
on other universes,

39:20.225 --> 39:23.328
so, please, tell
me, why can't we use

39:26.131 --> 39:28.567
millions of dollars

39:28.567 --> 39:31.403
of sophisticated
fuckin' equipment

39:32.938 --> 39:37.108
to clearly track and monitor
these fucking things?

39:39.445 --> 39:40.746
Fuck!

39:40.746 --> 39:41.980
Why?

39:45.651 --> 39:46.485
Anybody?

39:47.619 --> 39:48.454
- Sir,

39:49.855 --> 39:52.290
I've got some of
those old books.

39:52.290 --> 39:55.126
The Vatican librarian
had them scanned.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.962
They're coming in now.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.447
- Oh, fuck.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.085
- Well, well, look who's back.

40:21.887 --> 40:22.721
- Fuck.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.026
Ah, what happened?

40:28.994 --> 40:31.897
- You got your ass kicked.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.251
- Where's Red?

40:54.319 --> 40:55.420
- Fire watch.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.701
- Who's the girl?

41:11.102 --> 41:14.540
- They've been in here praying
all night, riding it out.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.809
- What's so
special about night?

41:18.744 --> 41:20.746
- Excuse me, my son.

41:20.746 --> 41:22.380
I heard your question
and thought perhaps

41:22.380 --> 41:24.816
I might be of some assistance.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.217
- Always, Father.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.788
- I'm Father Rodriguez,

41:29.788 --> 41:32.658
and these women are here
because it is unsafe

41:32.658 --> 41:36.427
for them to remain in
their own homes at night.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.797
- Safety in numbers.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.632
- Safety in geography.

41:43.935 --> 41:47.539
In Jack County,
young women are prey,

41:47.539 --> 41:49.541
and here in this sanctuary,

41:49.541 --> 41:52.811
they are safe from
their predators.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.783
The devil hunts at night.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.920
- So he, uh, they hunt women?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.892
- Not all women,

42:06.892 --> 42:08.794
just those who have
reached womanhood,

42:08.794 --> 42:11.229
but have not yet known a man.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.334
- So they're killing virgins?

42:16.334 --> 42:19.504
- Their purity is
of tremendous value.

42:20.505 --> 42:21.339
- Why?

42:24.676 --> 42:28.146
- Centuries ago
when Lucifer fell,

42:28.146 --> 42:30.616
he fell in these parts,

42:30.616 --> 42:34.786
and his seed was buried deep
within the soil of this place.

42:36.221 --> 42:39.958
What kept him at bay was the
religious fervor of the people

42:39.958 --> 42:42.327
and they power they
derived from a series

42:42.327 --> 42:43.995
of blessed artifacts

42:45.330 --> 42:46.932
housed in churches.

42:48.867 --> 42:52.403
Over time, these
artifacts and churches

42:52.403 --> 42:55.641
have been systematically
destroyed.

42:55.641 --> 42:57.542
Only one remains,

42:57.542 --> 42:59.444
a single one.

42:59.444 --> 43:02.714
This, this is the
last blessed artifact.

43:05.116 --> 43:08.386
In here it's the only
thing that stands

43:09.420 --> 43:11.589
between us and the demons.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.593
- So what's stopping them?

43:15.593 --> 43:17.663
- So long as this stands,

43:19.297 --> 43:23.468
they cannot enter without
purifying themselves first.

43:26.071 --> 43:28.740
To do this requires a sacrifice.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.144
Virgin blood.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.519
- Only demons can
destroy that thing?

43:42.688 --> 43:45.556
But in order for
them to get at it,

43:46.858 --> 43:49.494
they have to purify themselves
with virgins' blood?

43:49.494 --> 43:51.162
- Precisely, my son.

43:52.263 --> 43:54.099
And I am its guardian,

43:55.300 --> 43:57.869
the last defender of the faith.

44:01.840 --> 44:05.944
- Father,.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.846
What the hell are you
people doing here?

44:07.846 --> 44:09.480
Father, what are
they doing here?

44:09.480 --> 44:11.449
Look at them, this is a
safe place with children.

44:11.449 --> 44:12.483
Get out!

44:12.483 --> 44:13.952
Father, get them out of here.

44:13.952 --> 44:14.786
- Mom.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.824
- What does she
mean, "you people"?

44:20.525 --> 44:22.060
- It's okay, Angelina.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.362
It's okay, I'm here,
sweetie, just sleep, okay?

44:24.362 --> 44:25.196
It's okay.

44:26.631 --> 44:30.068
- Sister Juana, these
men are our friends.

44:30.068 --> 44:32.771
- With all
due respect, Father,

44:32.771 --> 44:35.741
these men are most
definitely not our friends.

44:35.741 --> 44:38.576
They are bar brawlers
and nothing more.

44:38.576 --> 44:40.846
- They are angels.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.547
- Hell's Angels, maybe.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.282
- They're here to assist.

44:44.282 --> 44:45.516
- Assist?

44:45.516 --> 44:47.285
Look at them, they're
bleeding, and from what?

44:47.285 --> 44:48.854
Did you ever think
of that, Father?

44:48.854 --> 44:51.757
- From a terrific
battle with them,

44:53.291 --> 44:54.793
and they survived.

44:56.227 --> 45:00.298
These men are deserving of our
compassion and our respect.

45:01.332 --> 45:03.935
They fought them, Sister, them.

45:05.303 --> 45:09.207
And he, the big one, he
saved little Angelina's life.

45:09.207 --> 45:10.141
- What?

45:10.141 --> 45:12.744
- He saved her life.

45:12.744 --> 45:13.779
- When?

45:13.779 --> 45:15.180
- Just now.

45:15.180 --> 45:17.348
I saw it with my own eyes.

45:19.017 --> 45:20.618
They need our care.

45:22.653 --> 45:24.155
Please, help them.

45:26.524 --> 45:27.525
- For you.

45:38.369 --> 45:41.172
- Sit still, let
me fix your head.

45:43.775 --> 45:46.277
- Yeah, good luck with that.

45:52.350 --> 45:55.086
- Did you really
fight with them?

45:57.255 --> 45:58.156
- Somewhat.

46:00.792 --> 46:02.193
Did you know 'em?

46:03.862 --> 46:08.033
- Well, like I said, small
town, everybody knows everybody.

46:09.200 --> 46:12.303
They rode into town
a few months ago.

46:12.303 --> 46:16.474
The prime suspects, a group
of riders from down south.

46:19.477 --> 46:23.181
Came in one night causing
all sorts of trouble.

46:23.181 --> 46:24.782
Then they rode out.

46:29.654 --> 46:32.457
We never saw them again,

46:32.457 --> 46:34.960
not until the girls
started disappearing.

46:36.027 --> 46:36.862
- Fuck.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.132
Take it easy, will ya?

46:41.132 --> 46:43.668
- Hold still, you big baby.

46:45.837 --> 46:47.272
- How old is she?

46:49.440 --> 46:51.076
- 17 in a few weeks.

46:51.076 --> 46:53.344
I can hardly believe it.

46:59.985 --> 47:02.287
- She looks just like you.

47:02.287 --> 47:03.421
- Thank you.

47:11.196 --> 47:13.331
- You never fucking listen.

47:52.403 --> 47:54.039
- Are you okay?

47:54.039 --> 47:56.141
- Yes, just a bit hungry.

47:57.808 --> 48:00.845
- I'm sure your mom
has something for you.

48:00.845 --> 48:02.948
- Are you scared of them?

48:04.582 --> 48:06.217
- No.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.052
Are you?

48:08.319 --> 48:10.455
- No, not anymore.

48:32.877 --> 48:35.680
I have you to protect me.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.166
- I think I found something.

48:55.166 --> 48:56.867
- All right, show me.

48:56.867 --> 48:59.870
- Malleus Maleficarum 1487.

48:59.870 --> 49:01.806
- Heinrich Kramer.

49:03.241 --> 49:07.478
- Now, apparently, according
to this, religious artifacts.

49:07.478 --> 49:08.579
- Yeah?

49:08.579 --> 49:10.115
- Are repellent to demons.

49:10.115 --> 49:12.050
- Which is why
they didn't go in.

49:12.050 --> 49:13.384
They came.
- Right.

49:13.384 --> 49:14.519
- It's a church.
- Right.

49:14.519 --> 49:16.321
Now, look at this.

49:16.321 --> 49:18.556
This cross is important.

49:18.556 --> 49:22.893
See, now the area used to have
dozens of blessed crucifixes

49:22.893 --> 49:23.961
just like this.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.363
- Mm-hmm.

49:25.363 --> 49:29.167
- But over the years
they've been lost or stolen.

49:29.167 --> 49:33.504
- Hmm, what is it about this
thing that makes it so special?

49:37.842 --> 49:39.677
- We made it through
another night.

49:39.677 --> 49:41.912
How do you feel?

49:41.912 --> 49:44.049
- My stomach hurts a little.

49:44.049 --> 49:46.251
- You're probably hungry.

50:04.769 --> 50:06.504
What happened?

50:06.504 --> 50:07.438
- Help me.

50:11.609 --> 50:12.910
- Jesus.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.379
- Where was she?

50:14.379 --> 50:16.814
- Pancho found
her on the street.

50:18.583 --> 50:21.152
- Father, I think she's
trying to say something.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.587
- What is it, Mina?

50:22.587 --> 50:24.055
- I saw them.

50:24.055 --> 50:26.291
- What, are you sure, where?

50:28.693 --> 50:30.428
- The factory.

50:30.428 --> 50:31.496
- What?

50:34.199 --> 50:35.032
Oh my God.

50:37.935 --> 50:39.404
- What the fuck are
they doing here?

50:39.404 --> 50:42.307
- Rafa, it's okay.

50:42.307 --> 50:44.075
- How is she?

50:44.075 --> 50:45.510
- They others,
they still might be alive,

50:45.510 --> 50:47.578
Carmelita and Maria.

50:47.578 --> 50:49.013
- What, where?

50:49.013 --> 50:50.648
- The factory.

50:58.856 --> 51:00.425
- Then let's do this.

51:00.425 --> 51:02.059
We've been waitin' by too long,

51:02.059 --> 51:04.495
lettin' these diablos kill
our sisters and our daughters,

51:04.495 --> 51:05.396
too long.

51:05.396 --> 51:06.597
Let's get 'em back.

51:06.597 --> 51:07.432
- Wait.

51:08.933 --> 51:09.767
Wait.

51:12.203 --> 51:14.539
- Don't tell
me to wait, Jefe.

51:14.539 --> 51:17.742
- Nobody tells
Pancho to fucking wait.

51:19.977 --> 51:22.513
- You know, I was
sleepin' off a hangover

51:22.513 --> 51:24.882
in a nice one bedroom
loft when me and my team

51:24.882 --> 51:27.017
got drawn into this shit.

51:31.422 --> 51:33.824
I'm Lieutenant Warren Carr.

51:33.824 --> 51:36.794
This is Petty Officer
First Class Greg Jackson,

51:36.794 --> 51:40.331
and Senior Chief Petty
Officer Alexander Michaels.

51:40.331 --> 51:42.667
We're with a Navy SEAL team.

51:44.068 --> 51:47.872
Our mission was to covertly
neutralize the threat

51:49.807 --> 51:52.143
that's assaulting your town.

51:53.344 --> 51:55.780
Problem is we had no idea who

51:57.682 --> 51:59.950
or what we were up against.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.421
Moving forward, I think
it's best that we have

52:03.421 --> 52:05.756
the blessings and the support

52:05.756 --> 52:08.193
of the local town leadership.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.196
Wouldn't you agree?

52:15.966 --> 52:16.801
Good.

52:18.203 --> 52:20.771
'Cause if you wanna
get out of this alive,

52:20.771 --> 52:24.175
you can either listen
up and help us out,

52:25.943 --> 52:29.247
or you can stay the
fuck out of our way.

52:32.583 --> 52:33.751
- Okay, Rambo.

52:34.652 --> 52:35.986
Show a Jefe how.

52:37.588 --> 52:39.190
- Come with me.

52:39.190 --> 52:40.925
The building's
guarded by three cops,

52:40.925 --> 52:42.793
one at each entrance.

52:42.793 --> 52:44.862
There's five cop cars out back.

52:44.862 --> 52:46.431
- So there must be more.

52:46.431 --> 52:47.532
- Yeah, maybe.

52:47.532 --> 52:48.999
- How many?

52:48.999 --> 52:51.068
- Well, it's impossible to tell,

52:51.068 --> 52:52.737
and we don't have
the proper support

52:52.737 --> 52:55.773
to get eyes on this guy, so.

52:55.773 --> 52:58.576
- I've been there before
to the south side door

52:58.576 --> 53:00.278
is a loading dock.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.213
- Is there anything else?

53:02.213 --> 53:03.914
- Yeah, the basement.

53:03.914 --> 53:05.816
The door's right here.

53:05.816 --> 53:08.286
- We'll sweep around this way.

53:08.286 --> 53:11.989
Red and Whisk will go
with you to clear here.

53:11.989 --> 53:14.992
Red take south, and
we'll take east.

53:16.827 --> 53:18.663
You ghost us,

53:18.663 --> 53:19.864
and I'm gonna put
two in your chest

53:19.864 --> 53:21.799
and one through your throat.

53:27.405 --> 53:28.906
We clear?

53:33.978 --> 53:34.812
Good.

53:36.314 --> 53:38.916
- I just gotta say it.

53:38.916 --> 53:41.352
I got a bad feeling
about this one.

53:41.352 --> 53:43.220
- Yeah, why don't you keep
that shit to yourself?

53:43.220 --> 53:44.755
- Shut the fuck up, Whisk.

53:44.755 --> 53:48.092
- I'm just sayin'
somethin' ain't right.

53:49.627 --> 53:52.797
Look, there's some
bad juju on this.

53:57.568 --> 53:58.903
- Feel the same?

54:01.238 --> 54:03.774
- Look, this ain't the mission.

54:03.774 --> 54:07.645
We're supposed to recon,
assess, neutralize,

54:07.645 --> 54:12.249
not hook up with fuckin'
American me over there.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.552
Look, we've all
seen these things.

54:14.552 --> 54:15.820
We can't kill 'em.

54:15.820 --> 54:18.255
Shit, we didn't even
make a dent in 'em.

54:18.255 --> 54:22.026
We go in there, we
probably ain't comin' out.

54:24.295 --> 54:25.463
- Yeah, maybe.

54:29.233 --> 54:30.935
But I ain't quittin'.

54:33.971 --> 54:37.207
I ain't ringin'
that fuckin' bell.

54:37.207 --> 54:38.142
That clear?

54:40.445 --> 54:41.278
- Okay.

54:42.680 --> 54:46.651
So tell me, why is it always
virgins with these guys?

54:49.286 --> 54:52.022
- Everyone's got a
right to get home.

54:52.022 --> 54:53.358
- Fine, watch my six.

54:53.358 --> 54:56.160
Don't let me fuckin'
get killed, sir.

54:59.464 --> 55:02.433
- When this is over, we
definitely gotta get a beer,

55:02.433 --> 55:04.802
'cause this is some heavy shit.

55:04.802 --> 55:07.538
- Jesus, shut the
fuck up, Whisk.

55:46.811 --> 55:50.648
- Do I
frighten you, Sheriff?

55:50.648 --> 55:51.549
- Uh, yeah.

55:52.750 --> 55:53.918
- Why?

55:56.654 --> 55:57.488
- I don't,

55:59.557 --> 56:01.225
I don't rightly know.

56:02.393 --> 56:05.430
- We share
a common enemy.

56:13.571 --> 56:15.473
You have failed me.

56:15.473 --> 56:18.576
- Yes, yes, you're
absolutely right.

56:34.659 --> 56:39.396
- Do you fear God
as much as you fear me?

56:39.396 --> 56:40.798
- As an American,

56:41.999 --> 56:45.636
I believe in one nation
under God, and yes,

56:45.636 --> 56:47.572
I am a God-fearing man.

56:48.773 --> 56:52.242
- Has it ever
occurred to you to ask

56:52.242 --> 56:55.279
where is he in all of this?

56:55.279 --> 56:57.114
- No, I, I reckon not.

56:58.516 --> 56:59.750
- I am the one,

57:00.718 --> 57:03.387
the one that punishes sin.

57:03.387 --> 57:05.656
For I am here in the flesh.

57:08.859 --> 57:10.027
Call your God.

57:11.462 --> 57:15.933
If there is someone greater
than myself, show me,

57:15.933 --> 57:17.001
introduce us.

57:17.868 --> 57:20.270
I am most eager to say hello.

58:01.946 --> 58:02.947
- Come here.

58:28.438 --> 58:30.107
- Gentlemen,

58:33.544 --> 58:36.814
what you're looking
for is, other room.

59:03.574 --> 59:05.910
- I'm gonna kill all of them.

59:10.314 --> 59:13.751
- I ain't going to
fight you, believe me.

59:18.122 --> 59:19.556
- Where are they?

59:24.929 --> 59:26.931
Where the fuck are they?

59:28.165 --> 59:32.336
- You're already
too late.

59:34.304 --> 59:37.541
When they got the
blood of 12, tonight.

59:41.445 --> 59:42.780
- Who, huh, who?

59:45.482 --> 59:47.652
- Right under their noses.

59:49.153 --> 59:49.987
It's,

59:52.790 --> 59:53.624
it's.

59:56.694 --> 59:57.828
- Hey!

59:57.828 --> 59:58.796
Hey!

59:58.796 --> 01:00:02.733
Hey,!

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.401
- Get him off!

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:07.337
- Let me go, let me go, let
me go, all right, all right,

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:08.205
all right.

01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:13.077
Fuck this.

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:19.516
- Go with them, Whisk.

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:26.891
Would somebody mind
to explain to me

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:28.592
what happened to our targets?

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:30.194
- Hey, hold up.

01:00:30.194 --> 01:00:31.829
- What?

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:34.631
Where the fuck are they, man?

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.532
- Incoming.

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:42.072
- Go on, get the
girl, take her to the church.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.844
- Well what about these
cocksuckers right here?

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.012
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:50.447
Where the fuck are you goin'?

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:53.050
What the fuck?

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.385
- We'll take care of this.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:56.220
We got it.

01:00:59.123 --> 01:00:59.957
We got it.

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:18.475
- Let's go.

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:24.048
- Moving?

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:24.949
- Yes, sir.

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:30.520
- How much time til we
get new eyes in the sky?

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:34.624
- I contacted ops, so
probably an hour or so.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.626
Sorry about before.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.328
- Right, no worries.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.533
- Sir.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.944
- Jacobs.

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:55.679
- How the boys doing?

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.416
- Well, they're still alive.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.886
Can't promise for
how long though.

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:05.189
I mean, without air
support or ground support,

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.257
it's kind of hard for
them to do their mission.

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:09.226
Kind of a fool's errand.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.928
- Well this is all I can
do without attracting

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:12.529
too much attention.

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:16.967
Too many people will
ask too many questions.

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:18.135
- Yeah, right.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.841
Well, I'll tell ya what.

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:29.613
Jake, why don't you tell
your liberal fuck friends

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:33.483
back in Washington they're about
to lose millions of dollars

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.019
'cause they won't
give me what I need

01:02:35.019 --> 01:02:37.855
to properly take
care of our boys.

01:02:38.722 --> 01:02:41.025
- What do you suggest?

01:02:41.025 --> 01:02:44.361
- What do I suggest, Commander?

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:46.363
They need help,
they need backup.

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:47.998
They are in a shit storm.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:49.166
What do I suggest?

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.067
Hey, Ping?

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:51.568
- Yes, sir.

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:54.438
- How long to get the QRF
team at the station inserted?

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:55.372
- Three hours.

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:56.373
- Three hours.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.975
- HALO drop?

01:02:57.975 --> 01:02:59.176
- Yes, sir.

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:00.610
- Bingo.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.346
- I'll get the Pentagon.

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.448
- Barnes already
has them on line.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:07.451
Good to see you doing
your job, Commander.

01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:26.303
- Juana!

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:28.772
Juana!

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.576
- What?

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:36.146
- We gotta get your
daughter to the church.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:40.918
- Here, put this on.

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:42.152
- Mama,
I don't feel good.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.187
- I know, I know,
but we gotta hurry,

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.455
- Why
do we have to be--

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.857
- Shh.

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.746
- Go to the chapel.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:54.051
- Red, start lockin'
down all the fuckin' entrances

01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:55.285
and exits.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.486
You fuckin' stick
your, keep your eye

01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:59.789
on the fuckin' chicks.
- Lieutenant Carr.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.192
- Who the fuck are you guys?

01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:03.427
- We're here to save
your sorry asses,

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:04.894
so I'd appreciate
some gratitude.

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.130
- Who ordered this?

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:07.364
- Control.

01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:09.299
Where do you want this?

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:13.003
Go for Catfish.

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:23.047
- Tell those motherfuckers to
get us the fuck out of here.

01:06:24.248 --> 01:06:26.216
- Roger that, we'll
extract to PZ one.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.051
Let's move.

01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:28.952
- Hey, what about them?

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.691
- Looks like you bit off
more than you could chew.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.661
Sorry, but we've
got another mission.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.629
I suggest you
neutralize this threat,

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:41.498
neutralize it quickly.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.500
Pop those red flares.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.669
- You just gonna leave
this fucking people here?

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:47.971
- Look, I admire what
you're tryin' to do,

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:49.873
but we have another
mission to handle.

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:51.975
We don't have room for them.

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:54.544
Let's move.

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:57.981
- What's your mission?

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:00.717
What's your mission?

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:03.687
What the fuck do you mean
you don't have room for 'em?

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.712
Whisk, I need you to go keep
your eye on that priest.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:29.979
All right?

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:31.215
I don't know where
the fuck he's at,

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:32.015
and I don't know what
the fuck he's doin'.

01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:32.982
- Let her go!

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:35.119
LT, do something!

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:36.353
- Guns down.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.755
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, it's okay.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.257
It's gonna be okay.

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:42.192
- I'm fixin' to take this
here pretty little prize

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:45.829
to whatever that
thing is over yonder.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:46.830
- Easy, man.

01:07:48.232 --> 01:07:49.499
- Arms up, boy.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.736
- Easy, easy, easy.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:56.240
- Hey, look, they're
gonna kill you

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.608
when they're done
with you anyway.

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:01.845
Or I could kill you
know, if you'd like.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:05.048
- Mr. Tough Guy.

01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:07.083
Well, well, well, Mr. Tough Guy,

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.486
them there folks over
there's gonna give me

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:12.922
a big ol' heap of coin,
so when this here's over,

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:16.893
I can buy me someone as
tough as you, Blackie.

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:18.362
Imagine that.

01:08:18.362 --> 01:08:21.698
Good ol' Miller, proud owner
of a big ol' dumb nig--

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:24.734
- Angelina!

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.519
- Hey!

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:47.991
- No, no, that won't be necessary,
they, they can't come in.

01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:49.091
- I'm not takin' any chances,

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.160
Father.
- Hey!

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.895
- Every little bit helps.

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:12.582
- Help, Father, do something!

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.319
- They're from God.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:21.658
We must stop
resisting their will.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.059
- Let them watch!

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:27.197
I want them to watch this.

01:09:40.344 --> 01:09:41.845
- Holy shit.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:45.349
Commander,

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.919
we have to put an
end to this now.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.689
- How do you mean, sir?

01:09:58.094 --> 01:09:59.195
- Agent Barnes.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.397
- Sir?

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:02.499
- Would you get me
the Secretary, please?

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:03.833
- Yes, sir.

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:07.337
- You think you can
make a phone call

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:09.138
and make all this disappear?

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:12.342
My job is to keep
this country safe.

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:16.513
The death of one drunk
ex-doorkicker is not my concern.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.216
- That drunk ex-doorkicker

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:23.820
saved my life when you
were just a shit stain

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.357
in your mommy's
drawers, so please,

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:28.625
a little respect.

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:31.261
- Sir, got him.

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:32.829
- Mr. Secretary.

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.231
Yeah, we have a situation.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.366
Yes, sir.

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:07.664
- Control, this is Zulu
Six, I am in the air.

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:09.333
Package is on the way.

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:37.854
- One minute to impact.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.805
- I've already won.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.845
- I.

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:34.410
Abort, abort.

01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:40.349
- Control,
