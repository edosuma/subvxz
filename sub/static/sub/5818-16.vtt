DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.760 --> 00:05.046
Let's see what else is out there together.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.245
I suppose there's no one I'd rather
explore this dreadful world with.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.404
-(GUNSHOTS)
-(GASPS)

00:10.840 --> 00:11.887
Bag 'em up and let's go home.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.085
DAMON: I have a way to take down Rayna.
A pile of bricks called the Armory.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.567
VALERIE: The Armory
is a black hole of lies.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.440
(GRUNTS)

00:19.760 --> 00:22.127
STEFAN: As long as I have this scar,
Rayna will hunt me.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.407
But if she dies for good,

00:23.600 --> 00:25.728
everyone with that scar
on your chest does as well.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.770
STEFAN: I sacrificed everyone
and everything for you.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.247
If there is even a fraction of you
that cares about me,

00:31.440 --> 00:32.805
then you will not walk out that door.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.281
- MATT: All right, I did it. He's out.
{GROANS)

00:35.600 --> 00:37.125
Now I never see you again, right?

00:37.400 --> 00:38.447
Have a nice life.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.291
What if I were to tell you there
was a way for me to transfer that mark

00:41.640 --> 00:43.369
to somebody a little bit more deserving?

00:43.600 --> 00:45.090
It should've been Damon all along.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.290
You want to pit us against each other?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.970
Except it wasn't her idea.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.481
It was mine.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.607
RAYNA: The sun's coming up, Stefan.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.644
Make your choice.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.331
DAMON: It's a pretty big deal, you know.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.651
Me offering to take this scar from you.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.688
But hey, I've been on the bench for
quite a while, and you look pretty tired,

01:17.320 --> 01:20.324
so let me tap in. Give you a breather.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.648
Hashtag you're welcome.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.525
Are hashtags still a thing? I don't know.
It's been three years.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.368
Say yes, Stefan. You can stop running.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.089
You'll get your life back.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.683
And all it's gonna take
is one itty bitty transfer spell.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.962
Any more suspense,
I might pass out, little brother.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.363
'Course, I might pass out anyway.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.043
- DAMON: Come on.
-(SIGHS)

01:50.200 --> 01:53.204
Phone's in my pocket.
Valerie can do the spell.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.288
Hallelujah, he's seen the light.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.522
Now, I'm just gonna loosen
these love knots a little bit.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.962
Just to get his phone. Okay?

02:08.199 --> 02:09.281
(GUN CLICKS)

02:12.280 --> 02:13.691
Make sure he behaves.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.801
You're okay?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.210
Brother, I'm so full of werewolf toxin
I can't even feel my face.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.810
A little vervain is not gonna hurt me now.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.050
Thank you.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.047
(RAYNA SCREAMS)

02:44.720 --> 02:48.930
If you kill me, you kill anyone
I've marked with my sword.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.764
That includes your brother.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.331
- Don't worry about Stefan.
-(CHOKING)

02:52.560 --> 02:54.164
I'm just giving him a head start.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.611
VALERIE: See? Now I'm in St. Petersburg.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.121
Red pin, I'm in Malaysia.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.285
Red pin, oh dear,
I've landed in the ocean. (CLICKS TONGUE)

03:27.560 --> 03:28.607
(CHUCKLES)

03:28.960 --> 03:31.964
They do sell liquor elsewhere, you know.
It's best to travel light.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.124
Yeah, but it's my favorite kind.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.647
I'm wondering how many more of these
I can have.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.325
Now that I'm on a time limit.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.326
No time limits here.
The night is young, my friend.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.325
I'm not talking about tonight.
(SIGHS)

03:45.480 --> 03:48.165
I did the math,
Rayna Cruz won't live forever.

03:48.320 --> 03:53.008
Therefore, neither will I.
So... Tick took.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.287
Your newfound mortality
doesn't trouble you?

03:56.480 --> 03:59.484
No. Actually, the funny thing is,
it makes me feel human again.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.324
Like every minute counts.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.164
Then... Let's think of it as an adventure.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.321
Right now?

04:07.480 --> 04:10.529
Damon's gone.
You have no one waiting at home anymore.

04:10.680 --> 04:15.242
I have no one either. Why not
just follow where the red pins lead?

04:15.800 --> 04:21.170
(CHUCKLES) So, you wanna go pin-hopping
all over the world.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.366
While we search for a way
to get rid of your scar.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.441
We could trace Rayna's bloodline
back to wherever her ancestors come from.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.763
We'll start searching for answers there.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.645
But best case scenario, we save your life.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.366
Worst case, we have a long vacation.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.647
(CHUCKLES)

04:43.200 --> 04:46.363
Everyone you know
has made the choice that serves them best.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.000
Why not make a choice that serves you?

04:53.560 --> 04:54.561
(SIGHS)

04:54.880 --> 04:58.965
Well, I guess there's nothing left
to hold me back here.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.801
Sure.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.050
(BEEPS AND WHIRRS)

05:18.920 --> 05:21.924
ALEX: Three years with us, and you still
haven't learned to sit quietly.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.241
Do you like the change in scenery?

05:23.480 --> 05:26.370
(PANTING) Where is she?
What did you people do to her?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.925
Where's Mary Lou?

05:28.080 --> 05:29.320
We need your help.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.003
(EXHALES) The only help
I'd ever give you is off a cliff.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.049
Oh, I don't think that's true.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.925
Because we have something you want.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.448
Answers, about the research
we've been doing with your girlfriend.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.763
(PANTING) I'll do anything that you say.
Name your price.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.288
The price is a name, actually.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.010
Lorenzo St. John.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.521
Enzo.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.521
Why do you want him?

05:57.600 --> 05:59.602
So I can kill him myself.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.281
Not that I'm not grateful
for the chance to get some air,

06:04.520 --> 06:06.409
but what exactly am I doing?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.762
I believe Enzo released Rayna Cruz.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.806
Why, I have no idea.
Why does Enzo do anything lately?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.804
But I have learned over time
that if I can't trust my family,

06:16.040 --> 06:18.441
I certainly can't trust my usual team,

06:18.640 --> 06:20.290
and that's where you come in.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.289
You can be the one to hunt him down.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.131
You trust the girl you've held captive
for three bloody years?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.971
(CHUCKLES)
Trust may be too strong a word.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.441
But after you see the results
of our experiments,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.325
you'll be highly incentivized
to do what I want.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.490
(BEEPS AND WHIRRS)

06:39.720 --> 06:40.960
Are you all right?

06:41.160 --> 06:43.481
Just, just feeling cold.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.320
Who could blame you,
in this horrid damp basement?

06:46.560 --> 06:49.643
Every day, I dream
I'll carry you away from this place,

06:49.840 --> 06:53.003
leaving a trail of gutted corpses
in our wake.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.925
(CHUCKLES) You seem quite yourself.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.651
-(CHUCKLES)
-(GASPS)

06:58.840 --> 06:59.921
What happened?

07:00.240 --> 07:01.526
They gave me pills.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.845
Made from Rayna's blood.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.010
It's poisonous to witches.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.841
Bring Enzo back to me, alive,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.002
and I'll give you everything
I have to heal her.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.009
No, please don't go.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.843
I have to. I'm going to save you.

(DOOR CLOSES)

07:34.720 --> 07:36.370
Hey, Bartel, what's up? I got your text.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.325
I owe you for calling off the alert

07:39.560 --> 07:41.801
on the whole hostage hoax,
so whatever you want, man.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.281
(GRUNTS)

07:45.480 --> 07:49.041
All he wants is to cooperate with me.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.329
I compelled him to summon you here
while remaining silent and calm.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.171
Detective, cuff yourself to the car.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.085
(EXHALES)

07:59.320 --> 08:03.086
So, by now, I'm sure Alex has decided
that I'm the one who let Rayna escape,

08:03.240 --> 08:05.720
which, of course, is untrue.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.401
But what I've yet to understand is...

08:08.560 --> 08:11.404
Why did you release Rayna Cruz?

08:17.480 --> 08:20.768
So, Damon said he could take my scar
through a transfer spell.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.765
Does that make any sense to you?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.081
He must've been desperate

08:24.240 --> 08:25.730
-to come up with that idea.
-(SCOFFS)

08:25.920 --> 08:28.446
Ironic that he's the one
who finally figured it out,

08:28.600 --> 08:31.080
considering how far you and I went,
looking for a solution.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.764
- I suppose fate has a sense of humor.
-(PHONE BEEPS)

08:34.919 --> 08:36.001

08:36.440 --> 08:38.010
Taxi's here, I better go.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.844
Hey, be careful, okay?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.126
Always, love.
I'll get to Dallas as quickly as I can.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.521
(CALL ENDS)

08:44.920 --> 08:45.967
(SIGHS)

08:57.800 --> 09:01.805
Ah, you stayed to keep me company?
How sweet.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.961
Nice try.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.282
Once I'm done patching myself up,

09:06.560 --> 09:07.800
- I'm out of here.
-(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

09:07.960 --> 09:10.486
Because, as much as
I'd like to kill you first,

09:10.640 --> 09:12.961
my sword is on the move
and so is my target.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.329
I have to chase them both.
My mystical nature calls.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.651
-(G ROANS)
- So weird,

09:18.800 --> 09:21.406
that Stefan ran away from your offer.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.325
(WINCING) He's just being a martyr.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.609
He probably thinks
I can't handle the scar.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.646
As soon as I charge this, I'll call.
Tell him to get his ass back here.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.321
(GRUNTS) I'll do the transfer spell.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.569
That is downright noble.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.128
More than I expected from you.

09:39.320 --> 09:42.130
Especially considering everything
you have to give up.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.322
What am I gonna give up?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.011
I've been in a coffin
for the last three years.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.527
It's not like I was keeping up
with my hobbies.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.844
-(GROANS)
- Look at my arm. What do you see?

09:52.480 --> 09:53.527
Um...

09:53.920 --> 09:56.161
Someone who should've brought Band-Aids.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.366
I'm made up of regular flesh and bone.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.682
My body's 100% human.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.001
Even if I stay in good health,

10:03.200 --> 10:06.841
in 60 or 70 years I'll toddle off
to the big news station in the sky.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.045
Which means, right around the time
Elena wakes up, I'll be dead.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.170
So will you.
Because when I die, you'll die.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.206
But I'm sure you already figured out
that when you take Stefan's scar,

10:18.360 --> 10:20.681
you'll be giving up
your future with Elena.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.565
You'll never see her again.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.962
Hero move. Nice.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.722
Okay, gotta go.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.880
We are looking
for ways to get rid of a mystical scar.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.560
That's right.
It links me to a crazy woman.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.087
Not me. No. We're not linked.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.561
Oh, no, no, no, we're just friends.
And she's not crazy.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.085
Well, not in the bad way.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.925
Yeah. You've gone off topic.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.764
No, and now you've made her uncomfortable.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.001
I didn't make her uncomfortable.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.491
- She doesn't understand what we're saying.
- Ah.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.842
Nobody here has any idea
what we're saying.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.081
(CHUCKLES)

11:08.320 --> 11:12.405
Well, here's to our one-year anniversary
of chasing red pins around the world.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.207
Yeah.
One year of complete and total failure.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.044
Hey, it's not complete failure.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.442
And while we have not solved
your scar situation yet,

11:20.680 --> 11:23.923
we have discovered an astonishing variety
of tropical alcohols.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.441
(SLURP5)

11:32.120 --> 11:35.090
I'm afraid he can't
come to the phone right now.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.601
Nope. No. He never will.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.771
I brought up how long it's been. Sorry.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.281
No, it's okay. I know what day it is.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.363
I've actually been thinking
about it quite a bit.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.801
And?

11:47.960 --> 11:52.488
And I realized that by the time he wakes
up, I will probably be dead. (SIGHS)

11:53.640 --> 11:57.645
So, uh, no, never gonna call him again.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.645
And, likewise, he will never call you.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.247
So, I guess that makes this obsolete.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.641
(SIGHS)

12:11.480 --> 12:14.643
Well, cheers then.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.847
(CHUCKLES) Cheers.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.324
Mmm. My turn to order.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.807
(CHUCKLES)

12:27.000 --> 12:28.081
Uh, one more.

You took my sword, genius.
I need to get it back.

should've stayed put at the news station.

And let you kill my brother? Not likely.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.882

I said I'd give you everything I know

I put a little spin on your plan.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.725
Your suggestion was news to me--

28:31.920 --> 28:34.764
Not what I asked.
How long have you known the answer?

28:36.240 --> 28:38.208
For example, my thinking was,

28:38.440 --> 28:41.410
"Hey, the transfer spell
worked on Ric's babies.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.125
"Maybe it'll work on the scar."

28:43.440 --> 28:44.930
Three whole years go by

28:45.160 --> 28:47.401
and that little concept
never crossed your mind?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.409
If I was a betting man, which I am,

28:49.600 --> 28:52.763
I would bet
that you knew about the spell all along.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.209
And rather than sharing it
with my brother, you lied to him.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.447
I never lied to him.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.921
But you didn't tell him the truth, either,
did you?

29:00.120 --> 29:02.566
Because you didn't
wanna get rid of that scar.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.290
Because without his scar
to keep him running,

29:04.480 --> 29:06.448
he could've gone back to Caroline.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.081
How insecure could you possibly be?

29:09.280 --> 29:10.805
All right. I lied.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.287
But I wasn't protecting myself.
I was protecting him.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.601
By risking his life?

29:14.760 --> 29:16.683
By keeping you out of it.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.411
The phoenix scar
requires a special kind of transfer.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.126
It can only go to a blood relative,
and that would have meant waking you,

29:23.360 --> 29:25.931
and bringing you, and all the drama
that you come with, back into his life.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.891
A life which he was
finally thriving in without you.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.610
I get it. You think I'm a piece of crap.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.770
And, by the way, I was, before.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.843
And then I met a girl.
And she made me good.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.446
And that's why I need Elena in my life,

29:38.640 --> 29:41.849
and when I get her back in my life,
I will be there for Stefan.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.771
The only person you ever needed
was by your side all along,

29:44.960 --> 29:46.450
and you abandoned him.

She'll follow us.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.805
'Course she will. We have her sword.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.404
No.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.003
NORA: My turn for gloomy talk.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.289
I've been marked by Rayna Cruz,

38:40.480 --> 38:42.608
and I'll be running from her
for as long as I live.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.244
No. No.
That bitch has taken enough from us.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.483
Mary Lou, what are you doing?

38:50.760 --> 38:53.684
One good thing,
with the strength I have left.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.241
(CHANTING)

38:55.600 --> 38:59.764
No. You can't. Stop it. It's too strong.
You won't be able--

38:59.920 --> 39:02.605
I will not let her put you
in this Hell Stone.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.161
If you don't stop, you will die!

39:10.760 --> 39:13.127
I'm already dead, my love.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.931
It's my fault.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.281
No, this is all on me.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.682
I tried to have it all.

39:26.840 --> 39:27.887
(SNIFFLES)

39:28.440 --> 39:30.283
Next time it'll be different.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.645
Nora, don't.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.291
You must live.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.323
There is no life without you.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.488
- Come live with me, and be my love
-(CHANTING)

39:53.640 --> 39:56.007
And we will all the pleasures prove

39:56.240 --> 40:00.245
That valleys, groves, hills and fields...

40:01.640 --> 40:03.483
Everything will be okay, Stef.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.682
I'll get that stone,
and we'll make this right.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.485
NORA: ...or steepy mountain yields

40:10.520 --> 40:12.488
- And we will sit upon the rocks
-(CHANTING)

40:12.960 --> 40:15.201
Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks

40:16.360 --> 40:18.522
And I will make thee beds of roses...

40:19.000 --> 40:20.047
(TIRES SCREECHING)

40:24.840 --> 40:26.171
I love you.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.161
I love you.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.001
(SCREAMING)

40:37.160 --> 40:38.844
(DISTORTED SCREAMS)

40:52.200 --> 40:53.486
No!

40:59.560 --> 41:02.006
I'm gonna save you, little brother.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.843
I promise.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.362
I promise you.
