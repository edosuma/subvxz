<i>Wait you met him?</i> Yeah I met him last year
at that Christmas thing at

01:55.616 --> 01:59.818

Whoa.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.545

Who's the editor?

03:01.649 --> 03:03.615
Who's the editor?

03:04.684 --> 03:06.818
Oh, hi, oh, what?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.687
Oh, what, what is it?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.389
Edmonton?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.591
- Adam.
- Adam, great stuff!

03:12.593 --> 03:16.595
I've got my eye on you. I
love the choice of music.

03:16.597 --> 03:20.299
Oh that, actually
that wasn't my choice.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.867
Oh yeah that was, that was mine.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.870
Oh, so you're the genius.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.305
- Great job, Alan.
- Thanks man.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.340
- Great job Alan.
- Thank you.

03:28.342 --> 03:32.411
Great job. How's our mannequin bird
segment coming along?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.980
It's, I'm still cutting it,
looking good but it's not

03:34.982 --> 03:37.449
quite done yet, a little bit...

03:38.751 --> 03:41.320
Don't dick me around, guy.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.388
We're on a strict deadline.

03:43.390 --> 03:47.893
Nature talks with Orson
Schwartzman waits for no man.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.828
Yes Mr. Schwartzman.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.733
When nature talks, you listen.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.602
- Okay.
- Are you listening?

04:00.540 --> 04:02.307
Um, yes.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.709
Good.

04:06.546 --> 04:07.980
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.916
Wanna get fucked up tonight?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.952
Ah, I can't, I got,
I got stuff to do.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.887
Oh, what kind of stuff?

04:15.889 --> 04:20.559
It's like, errands
and, and dinner, and...

04:24.864 --> 04:26.565
You okay?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.967
What? Yeah.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.403
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

04:32.005 --> 04:33.438
Okay!

04:33.440 --> 04:36.541
That was believable. Good!

04:36.543 --> 04:37.643
See you later.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.412
The male red capped
mannequin bird.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.813
Mannequin of course
derives from the Dutch

04:41.815 --> 04:43.782
word meaning 'little man'.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.351
<i>The females of the species</i>

04:46.353 --> 04:49.621
<i>are very picky so the
males employ a peculiar</i>

04:49.623 --> 04:51.690
<i>sort of dance to impress them.</i>

04:51.692 --> 04:54.993
<i>Because mammals stand a
better chance paired, or</i>

04:54.995 --> 04:57.429
<i>in groups, than alone.</i>

04:57.431 --> 04:59.531
<i>Their very survival
depends upon their ability</i>

04:59.533 --> 05:03.035
<i>to find a partner and mate.</i>

05:14.047 --> 05:15.380
How long she known this guy?

05:15.382 --> 05:16.782
A year! Or something.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.651
- A year? A year?
- Yeah. I know. I know.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.320
It's so sudden. Who is this guy?

05:21.322 --> 05:22.754
Aaron.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.856
- Aaron?
- Aaron.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.058
Aaron.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.594
Aaron.

05:28.595 --> 05:31.563
- Why do you keep whispering it?
- Mark, you're up!

05:31.565 --> 05:34.666
Listen, let me fix this for
you. This, this is real easy.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.569
Come on, ready, don't
go. Just don't go.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.671
- Don't go, buddy.
- Ah, I told...

05:43.576 --> 05:45.010
What are you guys talking about?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.581
Girl stuff?

05:50.383 --> 05:52.651
Come on - gah!

05:53.453 --> 05:55.354
Suck my dick, pins!

05:55.356 --> 05:56.688
This place sucks!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.056
Alright, it's you.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.425
I think I broke Adam.

06:00.427 --> 06:01.626
He's fine.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.430
Dude.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.998
We're at a bowling alley, bowl.

06:09.102 --> 06:12.471
- Hey. Bowl.
- I can't.

06:13.606 --> 06:15.907
Hey, if you're not playing,
you just look like a child

06:15.909 --> 06:18.543
- molester wearing those shoes.
- What?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.912
Doesn't matter. You get a ball!

06:20.914 --> 06:23.749
You pick it up and
and give it a roll!

06:23.751 --> 06:25.450
- I'm going home.
- Listen to me.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.718
I'm going home, I don't wanna...

06:26.720 --> 06:29.421
Hey! Hey! Shh, hey!

06:29.423 --> 06:31.056
You get up there and you
bowl a strike right now,

06:31.058 --> 06:32.557
you prove to yourself that
you're gonna beat this,

06:32.559 --> 06:34.426
that you're gonna
be okay without her!

06:34.428 --> 06:36.928
Because you're Adam!

06:38.064 --> 06:39.931
You bowl strikes!

06:41.100 --> 06:43.935
Dude, just bowl.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.137
You're being a douche.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.882
Okay.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.884
It's just, it's just bowling.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.119
Don't worry about it.

07:35.688 --> 07:36.855
Adam!

07:39.759 --> 07:41.159
Adam.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.794
- Hi!
- Hey!

07:42.796 --> 07:46.598
- Hi, ah, you look great.
- It's good to see you.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.067
Yeah. I'm starving!
- Good!

07:49.069 --> 07:52.904
This place is amazing! It's always booked,
how did you get these reservations?

07:52.906 --> 07:56.975
I had to kill a guy.
Yeah. It was pretty easy.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.643
No, no I called weeks
ago because I knew you

07:58.645 --> 08:00.745
wanted to try it.
That's why I'm the best

08:00.747 --> 08:02.881
- boyfriend in the world.
- So sweet! You are.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.087
I've just been so tired
at work lately, I have to

08:09.089 --> 08:11.089
stop staying up so late.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.558
Which is partly
your fault, mister.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.667
Babe are you okay?

08:22.669 --> 08:24.803
Yeah! Yeah.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.605
You just seem preoccupied to me.

08:26.607 --> 08:32.177
I do? No, that's
weird, uh... hm.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.678
I don't know, maybe work
stuff, I don't know.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.913
Everything okay?

08:36.782 --> 08:39.049
You ever think about marriage?

08:39.052 --> 08:41.720
In, in general? Or...

08:41.722 --> 08:42.722
I mean like...

08:44.290 --> 08:47.859
Marrying me. You ever...?

08:47.861 --> 08:52.264
I'm, I have thought about
that, you know, my friends and

08:52.266 --> 08:54.833
I, we talk about
that stuff, why?

08:54.835 --> 08:58.637
No but I mean,
specifically, to me.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.905
Right.

08:59.907 --> 09:05.043
You ever...? Am I, am I?

09:05.045 --> 09:08.013
Are you what? Are,
what are you saying?

09:08.015 --> 09:10.115
- Nothing, I'm sorry.
- I don't know what's happening.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.051
No no no, I know, I'm just
thinking, thinking out loud.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.653
Okay.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.188
Hey, listen, happy anniversary.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.125
- Happy anniversary.
We did it, I'm proud of us.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.993
- Yeah. We're doing a good job.
- I think so.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.262
- I think we are.
- Yeah.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.665
I think we should get married.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.234
- What?
- What?

09:28.235 --> 09:32.237
- Yeah or no? What? Did you say we sh -
what are you saying?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.272
Yeah! I think we
should get married!

09:34.274 --> 09:36.641
Are you cra - what
are you talking about?

09:36.643 --> 09:38.677
- Is that crazy?
- Yes that's crazy!

09:38.679 --> 09:42.647
Okay, well I know that sounds
crazy but just hear me out.

09:42.649 --> 09:43.748
You're happy aren't you?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.250
- Yeah I'm happy, yeah.
- Okay, alright.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.819
Well what else is there? Really?

09:47.821 --> 09:52.090
I mean people overcomplicate these things but
that's really, at its essence, that's what it is!

09:52.092 --> 09:53.858
Right? We make each other happy!

09:53.860 --> 09:57.195
We have the same...
Favorite movie.

09:57.198 --> 09:58.097
Yeah.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.633
We don't sit there on
our things and post how

10:01.635 --> 10:03.335
much fun we're having,
we really have fun!

10:03.337 --> 10:05.770
Yeah, no, you never
post pictures of me.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.139
No! I think that's great.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.109
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.379
Okay. I love you, you love me.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.848
- Yeah...
- Let's just do it!

10:16.850 --> 10:19.784
What are we so afraid of? I mean I don't
know if it's being afraid I think

10:19.786 --> 10:21.308
- it's just being responsible.
You're in your head!

10:21.332 --> 10:22.887
You're thinking. And I've
been thinking too much too.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.023
- Get out of our heads!
- I can't believe we're

10:25.025 --> 10:26.858
- talking about this!
- I know, I can't either!

10:26.860 --> 10:28.627
- I just, okay.
- Shake it!

10:28.629 --> 10:30.328
I think that we have
a good thing going.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.030
Agreed.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.199
Don't you think maybe
we should just,

10:34.201 --> 10:36.267
- just what?
- Like, let it do its thing

10:36.269 --> 10:38.370
- and see where it goes?
- No, no, no, I'm tired of

10:38.372 --> 10:40.205
doing that. I don't want
to let it do its thing,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.207
I don't want to think about
down the line, I want to think

10:42.209 --> 10:44.209
about the now. I don't wanna
think! I just wanna do it!

10:44.211 --> 10:46.211
I wanna do the now, I
want to be in the now,

10:46.213 --> 10:48.179
and in the now, I
want to marry you!

10:51.384 --> 10:52.684
Are you serious?

10:52.686 --> 10:54.653
Julie, don't I look serious?

10:55.421 --> 10:57.188
You do look pretty serious.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.258
I just, it just hit me.
Why are we not doing this?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.926
- Oh my god.
- Everyone around us is doing

11:01.928 --> 11:03.995
it. And they don't have
nearly what we have.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.197
Yeah! Yeah.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.967
What do you think?

11:10.169 --> 11:12.070
Oh my god.

11:13.339 --> 11:17.776
Oh my god I'm sorry I just
don't I didn't - I don't,

11:17.778 --> 11:20.011
I don't know exactly what
to say, because this,

11:20.013 --> 11:22.914
- take your time!
- It feels like it's insane.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.716
Yeah, it is.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.785
Honey I didn't know
you felt that way.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.088
Don't, you know, take,
as long as you need!

11:30.090 --> 11:31.456
No I don't need time!

11:31.458 --> 11:36.761
This sounds insane but I
think, maybe, oh my god,

11:36.763 --> 11:39.330
- I think maybe...
- We should break up.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.768
- What?
- I think we should break up.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.704
And I know that seems
psychotic, I'm so sorry.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.105
- Are you joking?
- No.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.339
- This is a joke.
- No, uh.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.176
As soon as I said it out
loud I started to panic

11:51.178 --> 11:53.211
and it didn't feel
right, I'm so sorry.

11:53.213 --> 11:57.315
What's wrong with you? I don't know, I
don't know, I'm just, um, I'm spinning out

11:57.317 --> 12:00.418
a little bit and I'm not sure
what I'm saying but I do know

12:00.420 --> 12:02.854
concretely that we should
not get married, I just

12:02.856 --> 12:04.022
don't think this is working.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.612
You don't...? God I'm so sorry.
You don't think this is working?

12:06.637 --> 12:07.926
You just asked me to marry you.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.994
I know, it felt right in
the moment, but as soon as

12:09.996 --> 12:13.164
it was out in the ether, I got
really scared to live in that world.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.467
- But why would you...?
- I don't know, I don't know,

12:15.469 --> 12:17.168
I just can't see myself
waking up to your face

12:17.170 --> 12:18.970
every morning, you know
for the rest of my life!

12:18.972 --> 12:20.972
I mean, that sounds,
urgh! No offense, not your

12:20.974 --> 12:22.307
face, not your face!
You have a great face,

12:22.309 --> 12:23.908
a much better face
than I do, by the way,

12:23.910 --> 12:25.510
- I should be so lucky!
- I know!

12:25.512 --> 12:28.780
Your face is great, it's what's behind it that
I don't think I can live with for a long time.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.749
- Oh my god.
- I mean, a couple months,

12:30.751 --> 12:32.751
we don't have to break up,
I don't know what I'm talking

12:32.753 --> 12:34.219
about, forget it, forget
it, what are you ordering,

12:34.221 --> 12:36.888
what are you getting? I
just don't think I can...

12:43.229 --> 12:45.096
You are an asshole.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.399
An ass hole!

12:48.801 --> 12:52.103
Wait wait wait, Julie!
Hold up, wait wait wait!

12:52.105 --> 12:55.206
Congratulations,
you're gonna die alone!

15:25.058 --> 15:26.257
Hi I...

15:32.933 --> 15:34.432
I'm gonna look...

15:37.136 --> 15:38.303
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.538
How can I help you? Oh, I
just need a room, please.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.441
Okay is it just you
or anyone else... no?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.510
- No it's just me.
- Wife? Girlfriend?

15:45.512 --> 15:49.380
- Just me.
- Husband, friend, anything?

15:49.382 --> 15:50.682
It's just me.

15:50.684 --> 15:56.321
- Oh, hm, ah. Just one?
- Mhm.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.623
- Staying in the room?
- Yeah.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.260
Okay.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.433
And would you like a
second key? For any

16:08.435 --> 16:12.070
visitors, or friends, you know?

16:12.072 --> 16:15.540
No, no just one's fine. Thanks.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.080
Room for one.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.115
Thank you, rah..

16:24.117 --> 16:28.286
- Rohan.
- Sorry. Thanks.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.124
Tsk.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.406
<i>Hello?</i>

17:17.770 --> 17:20.204
These long tailed
mannequin males will

17:20.205 --> 17:22.740
actually compete with each
other for the attention of

17:22.742 --> 17:26.511
the female and of course,
the right to mate.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.614
The dominant male will
always attract the female

17:29.616 --> 17:32.450
over the weaker males,
this is the law of the

17:32.452 --> 17:39.424
jungle, and the natural
order of life! And love.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.127
Adam?

18:16.795 --> 18:19.363
- Hey.
- Holy shit.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.271
- Greg!
- Yeah! I know.

18:27.273 --> 18:31.109
- Oh my god.
- Right! Long time.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.244
- Yeah long time no see.
- From, uh...

18:33.246 --> 18:34.512
- Since college!
- College!

18:34.514 --> 18:37.415
Yeah, man! Old
school, I like it!

18:37.417 --> 18:39.484
This is great man, what
are you doing up here?

18:39.486 --> 18:43.287
Ah well just in town
visiting friends.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.356
Friends and family.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.824
Mainly family.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.861
Huh. You should
have called me, man.

18:49.863 --> 18:54.298
I know, I thought about
it but then, um...

18:54.300 --> 18:55.466
Hey, did you hear about Allison?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.534
Uh...

18:58.303 --> 18:59.837
Allison...?

19:00.539 --> 19:03.241
Allison George, your
girlfriend of eight years?

19:03.243 --> 19:07.211
Oh, right. Sure, yeah,
Allison. No, uh, what's up?

19:08.480 --> 19:11.415
Allison George is
getting married.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.352
Wow really? Great for her.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.188
It's crazy man, you guys
were together forever!

19:17.190 --> 19:19.757
Yeah. You guys were inseparable,
do you remember that?

19:19.759 --> 19:21.526
It was like, I thought
you guys were never,

19:21.528 --> 19:23.728
ever, ever gonna break
up and then you did.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.862
- Well, yeah.
- Do you remember that?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.265
- When you guys broke up?
- Yeah, no.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.433
Seriously you guys had
everything, do you

19:29.435 --> 19:32.803
remember that? Yeah well, it was
a long time ago.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.639
Not that long ago.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.207
It was pretty long ago.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.175
A year and a half.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.177
Ish.

19:39.311 --> 19:41.245
Closer to two.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.380
A year and a half.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.881
It was like two.
About two years.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.684
- I'm sure it's closer to a year and a half.
- I don't know how

19:46.686 --> 19:48.419
- you're so sure of that.
- Because I remember it,

19:48.421 --> 19:49.921
- it was really devastating.
- I didn't even

19:49.923 --> 19:51.422
remember her name
when you said it, so,

19:51.424 --> 19:52.664
you had to jog my memory, so...

19:55.727 --> 19:56.961
So what are you reading?

19:57.863 --> 19:59.630
Nothing, it's, I
was just looking at,

19:59.632 --> 20:03.601
I don't even know how,
I was just browsing.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.839
I'll talk to you later man.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.775
Yeah, okay.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.782
Sorry.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.553
- Excuse me... what?
- Sorry.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.657
- Hm. What?
- What?

21:32.659 --> 21:34.592
Oh I thought you said something.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.460
- I...
- What?

21:38.630 --> 21:42.900
Um... that reminds
me, do you wanna -?

21:44.771 --> 21:47.605
Do you wanna get
a coffee sometime?

21:47.607 --> 21:50.007
Uh, um.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.677
Or like a water, or
a juice? Something

21:52.679 --> 21:56.380
- like a, whatever you...
- No, um, I'm reading my book.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.649
- Oh, okay.
- So maybe another time.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.784
Is that?

21:59.786 --> 22:02.453
Oh, of mice and men,
that's a good one.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.689
I could just, I could
tell you how it ends.

22:04.691 --> 22:08.426
Excuse me? Yeah I could tell you
how it ends. How it...

22:08.428 --> 22:11.362
Lenny, he dies, he
dies. Lenny dies.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.030
George shoots him in
the back of the head.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.954
What? Because he's the only one
that really understands him.

22:15.979 --> 22:17.535
It's really beautiful, but it's

22:17.537 --> 22:18.736
heartbreaking.

22:23.375 --> 22:24.575
Are you serious?

22:24.577 --> 22:26.110
Yeah, seriously.
That's how it ends.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.646
No, are you serious, are
you serious right now?

22:28.648 --> 22:29.714
With this?

22:29.716 --> 22:31.482
Yeah I just said I was.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.584
You ruined this for me.
You just ruined this

22:33.586 --> 22:34.719
book for me. I was just,

22:34.721 --> 22:36.554
I just started reading
this book and...

22:36.556 --> 22:38.022
Oh, well I saved you like,

22:38.024 --> 22:39.790
what page are you on,
I saved you, like,

22:39.792 --> 22:41.892
- a hundred and eighty pages.
- What is wrong with you?

22:41.894 --> 22:43.561
What's wrong with you?

22:43.563 --> 22:44.795
Who hasn't read of mice and men?

22:44.797 --> 22:45.996
That's crazy.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.132
- I, I,
- it's a classic.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.534
I know, that is why, that
is why I'm reading it.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.536
Well you should
have read it by now.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.058
It's not my fault
you're a slow reader.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.541
You know she hasn't
read of mice and men?

22:57.543 --> 23:00.010
I know. Look, I'm not a
slow reader, okay?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.979
- I just haven't...
- In fact I'm saving you from

23:01.981 --> 23:04.548
the humiliation of having
to tell your friends and

23:04.550 --> 23:06.717
family that you haven't
read a timeless masterpiece.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.887
A timeless masterpiece
that you just ruined.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.428
Do you have time
for a coffee now?

23:19.097 --> 23:21.165
You know I can't tell if
you're charming or if

23:21.167 --> 23:22.967
you're just an asshole.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.738
Charming.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.609
Charming, I hope. I'm
sorry, you're right.

23:31.611 --> 23:32.877
That was rude.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.578
Because it is a great book.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.614
I'm sorry, I'm
just, I just really

23:36.616 --> 23:38.182
want you to go out with me.

23:38.184 --> 23:41.719
Okay so let me get this
straight, in return for,

23:41.721 --> 23:46.090
um, ruining this perfectly
good, brand new reading

23:46.092 --> 23:49.760
experience for me,
I should reward

23:49.762 --> 23:51.662
you by going out with you?

23:51.664 --> 23:54.165
Two things, it shouldn't
be brand new, we've

23:54.167 --> 23:57.168
established that, it's
been out for a long time,

23:57.170 --> 24:00.171
and I think it might be
more fun than reading

24:00.173 --> 24:01.772
alone in a library.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.609
And how would you know?

24:05.611 --> 24:07.044
Well because a books not
gonna have sex with you

24:07.046 --> 24:09.480
and I want to, very badly.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.148
Oh my god.

24:12.751 --> 24:16.020
I know this sounds crazy
but I think I love you.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.156
I just think I'm in love
with you, and I know that

24:19.158 --> 24:21.625
sounds crazy, and I
know, I know, okay,

24:21.627 --> 24:22.726
what, are you gonna, what?

24:24.129 --> 24:25.896
What is... what?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.099
- I do.
- You don't even know me.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.769
I know, and that's why I
want to share a cup of

24:31.771 --> 24:33.571
coffee with you because I
think it's weird, too, that I

24:33.573 --> 24:35.806
should love somebody that
I don't even really know.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.741
So I thought, we'll go get
coffee, I'll ask you where

24:37.743 --> 24:39.243
- you're from.
- Okay.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.478
Get to know each other,

24:40.480 --> 24:41.846
- and then, um,
- okay.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.047
You see where I'm
going with this?

24:43.049 --> 24:46.484
- Okay.
- Okay? Really?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.152
That worked?

24:48.154 --> 24:50.054
You must have a screw loose.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.258
- Kid, who are you?
- I'm Adam.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.775
- Hey man. I know, I know,
- ah! Jesus!

25:11.777 --> 25:14.845
It scared me too, I almost
forgot to give you my card.

25:14.847 --> 25:19.250
- Thank god you didn't forget.
- Uh, yeah. No, I didn't.

25:19.252 --> 25:21.986
That's got my website on
there, okay, my Facebook,

25:21.988 --> 25:23.988
- Linkedin's on there,
- I just need one.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.557
No you could use all of them,
and then there's email, too

25:26.559 --> 25:28.792
- that's right on there.
- Okay well I'll email you then.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.731
Okay good if you ever need to talk.
Yeah.

25:30.756 --> 25:33.130
I'll email you and I look
forward to emailing you.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.032
Yeah but if you
ever need to talk.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.001
Yeah I'll, I got it.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.003
Yeah, man.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.639
If you need to.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.641
Okay.

25:43.643 --> 25:47.144
- I'm still... crazy!
- Greg... Hamilton.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.548
Hey!

25:50.550 --> 25:51.749
Email me.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.950
What?

25:52.952 --> 25:55.953
- Email me. I don't know what that means.
- Email me!

25:55.955 --> 25:57.922
Oh! Okay, oh yeah.

26:14.039 --> 26:18.342
<i>- Adam?</i>
- Hey! You knew it was me.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.778
<i>Yes it was in my phone.</i>

26:20.780 --> 26:22.313
Oh right duh.

26:22.315 --> 26:25.783
<i>- What are you, uh...?</i>
- Uh, I am here.

26:25.785 --> 26:30.621
<i>I'm here. What? Oh my god why
didn't you tell me?</i>

26:30.623 --> 26:33.023
Well, I am telling
you, you dum-dum.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.826
<i>Well, listen, this is
crazy but we're having this</i>

26:35.828 --> 26:37.027
<i>dinner party tonight.</i>

26:37.029 --> 26:41.165
<i>Yeah. And, I don't know,
maybe you want to come?</i>

28:27.807 --> 28:33.177
No but seriously, you two.
You two, if there are two

28:33.179 --> 28:35.846
people in the whole world
that should actually be

28:35.848 --> 28:40.984
getting married, they're
right here, it's you two.

28:40.986 --> 28:44.288
I actually remember
when you guys met.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.890
Aaron said, 'David, this
is the first girl I can

28:46.892 --> 28:51.328
actually see myself
marrying.' And I was, I

28:51.330 --> 28:52.730
actually tried to
talk you out of it

28:52.732 --> 28:55.466
so I could ask
Allison out. I did!

28:55.468 --> 29:00.304
Because she's, look at her! Who wouldn't
want to marry her instantly! You would be

29:00.306 --> 29:02.339
- crazy not to marry her!
- - Down boy.

29:02.341 --> 29:05.976
If it doesn't work out,
I'm waiting in the wings.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.045
Text me, call me.

29:08.342 --> 29:09.781
Whatever you need to do.

29:09.782 --> 29:15.385
No but seriously, you guys
are actually fashioned for

29:15.387 --> 29:20.424
each other, you were made
for one another. And I do

29:20.426 --> 29:24.928
not know a more
intelligent, graceful

29:24.930 --> 29:28.232
couple than you guys.

29:28.234 --> 29:32.035
And they say that marriage

Mm-hmm. Allison was so glad you

Well it's big of you too.

34:26.664 --> 34:27.664
I guess we're both big.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.568
I like that we're
both big. Heyoo!

34:34.473 --> 34:36.540
No no no, I have actually
a very small penis.

34:37.641 --> 34:38.608

Oh.

34:40.279 --> 34:43.146

secure in that area.

34:45.248 --> 34:47.150

I'm exercising.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.411
I've never seen you exercise.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.712
I'm getting in shape!

38:02.714 --> 38:04.614
What's on your head?

38:04.616 --> 38:07.617
- Just a jogging thing.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.376
Yeah, nah, just the usual, you

38:33.378 --> 38:35.045

in the woods.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.080
- Wow.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.715
Sounds provocative.

38:40.351 --> 38:41.351
So.

You gonna call Allison
while you're here or am I

38:45.324 --> 38:46.489
not allowed to ask?

38:46.491 --> 38:49.659
I don't know, I haven't
really thought about it.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.329
Maybe. I think you should. I
still have that picture

38:52.331 --> 38:53.797
you took when you
went down to Carmel.

38:53.799 --> 38:54.998
Look, right there.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.034
Mom are you insane?

38:58.036 --> 39:01.104
It's been almost two
years you can't do that.

39:01.106 --> 39:04.007
- This is crazy, this is nuts
- I like the pic...

39:04.009 --> 39:06.776
- That you still have this.
- That is very immature.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.545
What are you doing?

39:08.547 --> 39:09.846
It's a picture of us!

39:09.848 --> 39:11.715
It's so weird that
you have that.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.616
What are you throwing
that away for?

39:15.920 --> 39:18.421
You are so dramatic.

39:18.423 --> 39:20.757
You are so dramatic.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.426
Just call her, if you're
here, you have the time,

39:23.428 --> 39:24.761
no big deal.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.499
Alright maybe.

- You know, I almost went pro.

42:35.654 --> 42:36.953
Oh I didn't know that.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.622
Blew my knee out in college.

42:39.624 --> 42:41.558
- Bummer.
- Yeah.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.992
That would have been
a different life.

42:42.994 --> 42:47.664
Really. I mean, travel
the world, fame, glory.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.868
No but things work out the way
they're supposed to, right?

42:56.607 --> 42:58.241
Whose serve?

42:58.243 --> 42:59.576
You take it!

43:10.321 --> 43:11.921
Shit!

- spiked it like that.
- Oh yeah. Oh spike, yeah yeah.

43:27.939 --> 43:32.642
That was a nice hit. I feel bad man, we
could have grabbed a beer or something.

Oh no, this is, this is great.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.813
Oh good. Yeah, okay.

So what's that gonna be about?

44:03.308 --> 44:05.341
Birds, you're into
birds? You like birds?

44:05.343 --> 44:11.914
No like, something like
pollution, climate,

44:11.916 --> 44:14.851
I don't know, something
like the environment.

44:14.853 --> 44:16.653
That's great! That's great,

44:16.655 --> 44:18.287
can't wait to see that.
That's really cool.

44:18.289 --> 44:20.723
- Okay my serve.
- Yeah.

44:24.128 --> 44:26.396
Okay now remember elbow

44:26.398 --> 44:27.764
balls of your feet.

44:27.766 --> 44:29.065
Elbows up, balls.

44:29.067 --> 44:30.867
- Yeah.
- Okay.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.769
Just go side to side, let's
get loose a little bit.

44:32.771 --> 44:35.838
Your shoulders, bring
it forward, bring

44:35.840 --> 44:37.373
your toes forward,

44:37.375 --> 44:39.008
There you

44:39.311 --> 44:40.210
Are you sure?

44:40.211 --> 44:42.679
No man you look like
a fucking idiot!

44:42.681 --> 44:43.946
- C'mon!

44:45.949 --> 44:47.884
- Okay here we go bud you ready?
- - Yup!

44:50.454 --> 44:52.422
There you go!

44:52.424 --> 44:54.924
There you go, bud.
Nice and easy, buddy.

44:54.926 --> 44:56.259
There, nice!

44:58.462 --> 44:59.462
Spike!

45:07.004 --> 45:08.337
Wow, almost got me there!

Almost!

45:12.810 --> 45:13.843

Yeah.

45:34.498 --> 45:38.067
Fucking fuck!

45:46.009 --> 45:47.477
Slipped!

45:48.312 --> 45:49.312
Sweaty.

45:51.348 --> 45:52.448
Sorry!

45:55.452 --> 45:56.786
Good game!

45:59.858 --> 46:00.957
Mister Shalman!

46:00.959 --> 46:02.830
Are you enjoying your stay with us?
Oh yeah,

46:02.855 --> 46:04.494
I'm having the time of my life.
Thanks.

46:04.496 --> 46:06.229
Wonderful! The elevators
are to your right.

46:06.231 --> 46:07.764
Oh they haven't moved?

46:09.133 --> 46:11.834
No they haven't moved,
fucking asshole.

46:40.931 --> 46:42.498
Oh my god...

46:45.803 --> 46:46.803
Hey!

46:46.805 --> 46:48.171
How are you buddy?

46:48.173 --> 46:49.472
How's it going?

46:49.474 --> 46:51.474
Come on give me the
details did you see her?

46:52.910 --> 46:54.310
Yeah.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.312
And?

46:56.847 --> 46:59.248
It was, it was nice.

47:01.351 --> 47:03.352
Is the wedding off?

47:04.588 --> 47:07.557
Wonder if I punch the
computer screen, I wonder

47:07.559 --> 47:10.993
if you would feel it. Do
they have that technology?

47:10.995 --> 47:13.162
- You could try.
- What do you want?

47:13.164 --> 47:14.197
You need a date.

47:14.199 --> 47:16.132
What? No, I don't,
the last thing I

47:16.134 --> 47:17.600
want to do is
go on another date.

47:17.602 --> 47:20.369
No no, to the
wedding, to the wedding.

47:20.371 --> 47:23.973
You can't show up stag, it's
suicide. You'll be annihilated.

47:23.975 --> 47:25.341
- Really?
- Mmm.

47:25.343 --> 47:27.343
Well what do you want me
to do? I can't just...

47:27.345 --> 47:28.377
I got you!

47:28.379 --> 47:29.379
I got you!

47:30.113 --> 47:31.113
Who?

47:31.115 --> 47:31.948
My cousin!

47:31.950 --> 47:33.249
Tallulah!

47:33.251 --> 47:34.517
Tallulah?

47:34.519 --> 47:36.018
Tallulah!

47:36.020 --> 47:37.920
What is she, like
a little fairy?

47:37.922 --> 47:40.156
She's a real girl
named Tallulah!

47:40.158 --> 47:42.024
She's your cousin?

47:42.026 --> 47:43.960
Yeah, second cousin but yeah.

47:44.561 --> 47:46.596
Does she look like you?

47:49.066 --> 47:50.600
You mean is she Asian,

47:50.602 --> 47:52.301
- are you asking?
- No, man, no!

47:52.303 --> 47:54.403
She's white, are you
happy, Mel Gibson?

47:54.405 --> 47:55.605
- She's white!
- Stop...

47:55.607 --> 47:56.915
Stop it that's not what I meant!

47:56.940 --> 47:59.408
All you do is love Asian girls,
that's what this is about.

47:59.410 --> 48:02.345
- What?
- Yeah you do.

48:02.347 --> 48:03.646
She's not me with boobs.

48:03.648 --> 48:05.448
She's a date to the
wedding so you have

48:05.450 --> 48:07.516
something standing between
you and massive amounts of

48:07.518 --> 48:09.151
shame and self-degradation!

48:09.389 --> 48:10.888
You just need a plus one.

48:10.889 --> 48:13.656
Who knows, you
might even like her.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.893
Alright, well, maybe. Thank you.

48:17.494 --> 48:19.962
Uh, listen I'm gonna go
take a shower but, um...

48:19.964 --> 48:21.297
Oh ho ho ho!

48:21.498 --> 48:22.498
What?

48:22.500 --> 48:25.968
What are, what are you wearing?

48:25.970 --> 48:27.637
What do you mean, it's
just tennis shorts?

48:29.206 --> 48:31.540
You look like you stole
a little boys underwear.

48:31.542 --> 48:33.042
I was playing tennis!

48:33.044 --> 48:34.143
You don't play tennis!

48:34.145 --> 48:36.379
Yes I do, I do sometimes.

48:36.381 --> 48:37.613
With who?

48:42.252 --> 48:44.020
- Aaron.
- Aaron? What?

48:44.022 --> 48:46.455
- Aaron, okay? Yeah.
- What are you doing?

48:46.457 --> 48:47.657
Hey listen, listen!

48:47.659 --> 48:49.959
You're fraternizing
with the enemy!

48:49.961 --> 48:52.028
The enemy? Give me a break.

48:52.030 --> 48:54.563
Grow up, mark, come on!

48:54.565 --> 48:55.531
He's cool!

48:55.533 --> 48:57.333
He's actually a really cool guy.

48:57.335 --> 48:59.035
I had fun today.

48:59.037 --> 49:00.536
You would like him
a lot, I think.

49:01.039 --> 49:04.106
I would? I feel like the three
of us should hang out.

49:06.710 --> 49:08.144
Why are you looking
at me like that?

49:08.146 --> 49:09.478
Why are you doing this?

49:09.480 --> 49:12.548
Listen, listen! Life
moves on, mark, and

49:12.550 --> 49:14.383
some of us are moving with it!

49:14.385 --> 49:16.585
Some of us can see your balls!

49:17.454 --> 49:19.388
- Good bye.
- Like a wonton sized...

49:19.390 --> 49:20.556
Bye bye!

49:45.182 --> 49:46.449
T-Tallulah?

49:46.451 --> 49:47.416
- Tallulah?

49:47.418 --> 49:49.485
- Hi!
- Hi, hi, Adam.

49:50.587 --> 49:51.420
Great.

49:51.422 --> 49:52.555
Nice to meet you!

49:54.124 --> 49:56.225
So how you doing?

49:57.461 --> 49:58.627
Good.

49:59.229 --> 50:01.263
- Sorry?
- Good.

50:01.631 --> 50:02.732
You sure?

50:04.601 --> 50:06.035
Yeah.

50:08.105 --> 50:09.138
Are you okay?

50:11.008 --> 50:12.341
Nervous.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.710
Don't worry about
it, I'm nervous too.

50:14.712 --> 50:18.014
So you're uh, you're
mark's cousin?

50:18.016 --> 50:18.714
Yeah.

50:18.716 --> 50:20.149
I'm so sorry.

50:22.554 --> 50:23.453
What happened?

50:23.454 --> 50:28.524
No no no, I was kidding
I was, mark's my friend.

50:29.559 --> 50:31.660
It's a joke.

50:31.662 --> 50:35.398
I don't know if it is a joke

50:35.400 --> 50:37.266
if it's not funny.

50:38.101 --> 50:41.203
Um, so you hungry?

50:41.205 --> 50:42.238
Not anymore.

50:44.141 --> 50:45.674
Did you have a chance
to look at the menu?

50:45.676 --> 50:53.676
Yeah, um, I read it about
five times by myself but I

50:54.118 --> 50:57.186
don't know where to look
so I just pretended that I

50:57.188 --> 51:01.190
was reading and then I
really was reading the

51:01.192 --> 51:03.659
menu over and over.

51:03.661 --> 51:06.796
What do you, what do you do?

51:06.798 --> 51:08.164
I make dolls.

51:10.167 --> 51:11.300
You make dolls?

51:11.302 --> 51:14.236
- And uh, doll houses.
- Huh.

51:14.238 --> 51:17.239
And little, little
doll furniture to

51:17.241 --> 51:20.076
go into the doll
houses. It's so tiny...

51:20.078 --> 51:22.445
And that leads to
doll upholstery and

51:22.447 --> 51:24.246
doll clothes and next thing I

51:24.248 --> 51:27.817
know I'm making the
tiniest little doll bow

51:27.819 --> 51:31.353
tie and I think it might
be affecting my vision,

51:31.355 --> 51:33.689
I've been having a lot
of problems seeing.

51:33.691 --> 51:36.092
Oh my god, that's terrible.

51:36.094 --> 51:39.495
So you should maybe
stop doing that, right?

51:40.697 --> 51:44.166
- Never.
- Wow.

51:44.168 --> 51:45.601
That's persistent.

51:45.603 --> 51:48.270
The dolls will leave me.

51:48.272 --> 51:49.572
What do you do?

51:51.274 --> 51:54.743
Uh, I'm, I'm a
documentary film maker.

51:54.745 --> 51:56.345
Can I see one of your films?

51:56.347 --> 52:00.816
Well no not yet but
hopefully soon.

52:02.652 --> 52:03.719
That's cool.

52:03.721 --> 52:04.721
Yeah?

52:05.822 --> 52:08.157
Yeah it is, thanks,
it's pretty cool.

52:08.159 --> 52:10.326
Well I can't wait to see it.

52:10.328 --> 52:12.228
- Thanks, really?
- Yeah.

52:12.230 --> 52:14.330
Yeah, alright. Well
you'll be the first.

52:14.332 --> 52:17.199
- I'll watch anything.
- Oh.

52:17.201 --> 52:19.635
Um. What are you gonna order?

52:36.921 --> 52:38.721
Okay, okay.

52:38.723 --> 52:41.490
What if I went up to that
guy, see that guy eating, uh,

52:41.492 --> 52:43.259
it looks like tortilla soup?

52:43.261 --> 52:45.394
Delicious. I
actually like staring at him.

52:45.396 --> 52:48.664
- Yeah, hey, head in the game. And I,
and I go up to him - yes, and he...

52:48.666 --> 52:51.200
And I say 'exthcuse me

52:51.202 --> 52:56.272
thir, exthcuse me thir,
that tortilla thoup is

52:56.274 --> 52:58.707
gonna make you
tortilla poop!'

53:00.210 --> 53:02.444
and I just walked away.

53:02.446 --> 53:04.914
That's not offensive
it's just odd.

53:04.916 --> 53:06.615
It's a little offensive.

53:06.617 --> 53:08.450
Alright what you got?

53:09.854 --> 53:11.387
Okay.

53:11.389 --> 53:13.455
- The couple next to us?
- Yes.

53:16.326 --> 53:17.526
What if I took off my panties?

53:17.528 --> 53:18.928
Oh I like it already.

53:20.463 --> 53:23.866
And I slipped them
into his coat pocket?

53:23.868 --> 53:27.903
And when they get home
tonight she finds the

53:27.905 --> 53:32.441
underpants and they get
in this huge fight about

53:32.443 --> 53:35.544
whether or not he's
cheating on her and the

53:35.546 --> 53:40.516
more he denies it the more
she thinks he's a liar so

53:40.518 --> 53:45.754
they break up and all their
friends side with her and

53:45.756 --> 53:48.958
he's left wondering 'how
the fuck, how the fuck did

53:48.960 --> 53:52.528
these underpants get
in my coat pocket?'

53:52.530 --> 53:56.265
and he still insists years
later when he calls her,

53:56.267 --> 53:58.634
'they weren't mine I don't
know where they came from, '

53:58.636 --> 54:03.639
and he slowly goes insane
and he becomes an alcoholic?

54:03.641 --> 54:06.875
And all of his friends and
family just completely

54:06.877 --> 54:12.348
desert him and he dies alone.

54:12.350 --> 54:13.916
Of aids.

54:15.518 --> 54:20.322
That has gone way too far.

54:20.324 --> 54:24.326
You have veered into a
level of depravity that is

54:24.328 --> 54:27.363
upsetting to say the least.

54:27.365 --> 54:29.932
I feel like I don't know
you, I don't want to play

54:29.934 --> 54:31.934
- this game anymore.
- These are one of the things

54:31.936 --> 54:33.335
that I'm very good at.

54:33.337 --> 54:37.039
That was incredible you
just broke the game.

54:37.041 --> 54:39.008
- You win? I guess.
- I win.

54:39.010 --> 54:41.043
You my friend are the winner.

54:41.045 --> 54:42.544
Whoo!

54:42.546 --> 54:44.847
Wow! Congratulations,
you're officially

54:44.849 --> 54:45.981
the worse person I know.

54:45.983 --> 54:48.951
Aw, that's sweet, thank you.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.719
Let's get you some
ice cream, kiddo.

54:50.916 --> 54:52.055
Don't mess with me.

54:52.056 --> 54:55.658
Oh I won't, I won't, because
then you'll come up with some

54:55.660 --> 54:58.327
perverted scheme to ruin
my life and then I won't

54:58.329 --> 55:00.763
even know it for years to come.

55:00.765 --> 55:02.564
You won't even see it coming.

55:05.068 --> 55:07.770
- It's...
- It's very good, I feel...

55:07.772 --> 55:12.675
I feel terrified, and impressed.
It's a mix of emotions.

55:34.597 --> 55:35.731
Hi.

55:35.733 --> 55:37.933
Oh sorry, uh.

55:37.935 --> 55:39.702
What are you thinking?

55:41.404 --> 55:43.339
Oh nothing sorry.

55:43.773 --> 55:44.973
Are you on drugs?

55:46.343 --> 55:48.677
No, no.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.612
Do you wanna be?

55:52.682 --> 55:54.049
No.

55:55.819 --> 55:59.455
I happen to have a bunch
of Adderall in my purse.

56:01.358 --> 56:03.692
Did you say you have a
whole bag of Adderall?

56:03.694 --> 56:05.060
Yeah.

56:05.062 --> 56:07.863
What, why?

56:09.766 --> 56:14.536
I mean, I'm an artist, so...

56:14.538 --> 56:17.673
- That makes sense.
- Yeah, long nights.

56:17.675 --> 56:20.743
Would you like to be my date
to my ex girlfriends wedding?

56:20.745 --> 56:24.113
- Okay.
- Yeah? Great.

56:31.855 --> 56:34.456
<i>For the north American
jumping spider, mating can</i>

56:34.458 --> 56:36.558
<i>be a dangerous game.</i>

56:36.560 --> 56:40.829
<i>In this delicate moment,
the male must woo the</i>

56:40.831 --> 56:45.100
<i>female spider or she will
kill him and eat him.</i>

56:45.102 --> 56:49.104
<i>If the male fails to woo
the female, she will stab</i>

56:49.106 --> 56:54.810
<i>him with her poison fangs
and suck out his insides.</i>

57:51.935 --> 57:53.969
Adam? Adam!

57:56.606 --> 57:57.773
Allison?

57:59.008 --> 58:03.245
What are... what
are you doing here?

58:03.247 --> 58:04.880
What are you doing here?

58:04.882 --> 58:08.016
That is so funny
running into you.

58:08.018 --> 58:10.652
Well I work here.

58:10.654 --> 58:13.689
Oh yeah Ella moss, crazy.

58:14.858 --> 58:17.159
Yeah for seven years.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.627
- That's right,
- right.

58:18.629 --> 58:22.197
I forgot it was on this block.

58:22.199 --> 58:23.499
Hm.

58:23.933 --> 58:25.834
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you.

58:26.803 --> 58:28.103
Were you jogging?

58:28.105 --> 58:30.506
Oh yeah, yeah, just
got into jogging.

58:30.508 --> 58:33.809
You're into jogging now? Yeah ever
since I quit smoking I figured...

58:33.811 --> 58:35.544
You did not quit smoking.

58:35.546 --> 58:36.778
I did! I did.

58:36.780 --> 58:37.780
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:38.848 --> 58:41.149
Wow thought you'd never quit.

58:41.851 --> 58:43.986
A lot's changed
since we went out.

58:43.988 --> 58:45.287
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:46.156 --> 58:49.157
Like what else? Oh man, I gave up
kind of everything.

58:49.159 --> 58:52.060
I got really into raw,
not raw foods totally, but

58:52.062 --> 58:53.896
- more raw foods,
- okay.

58:53.898 --> 58:56.899
I still cook a little
bit. I'm still a cook.

58:58.001 --> 58:59.101
Too moist to my liking.

58:59.103 --> 59:00.936
- Ugh I hate that word!
- I know, sorry.

59:02.306 --> 59:04.572
Moist always brings everything
to a standstill, yeah.

59:04.597 --> 59:06.065
It does I've always said that.

59:07.076 --> 59:08.143
Aw man.

59:08.145 --> 59:10.312
Hey you know I'm
the manager now.

59:10.314 --> 59:13.081
- Are you serious? That's great!
- I am! I know!

59:13.083 --> 59:14.983
- Wow, good for you!
- Yeah I get free trips

59:14.985 --> 59:17.052
- to Paris once a year.
- What?

59:17.054 --> 59:20.289
- What's cooler than that?
- Not much, could be worse.

59:20.291 --> 59:23.559
Come on, you're practically
running the fashion industry.

59:23.561 --> 59:25.894
Yeah I don't know
about that but it's,

59:25.896 --> 59:27.095
- it's pretty cool.
- It's cool.

59:27.097 --> 59:30.699
What about you, y'know?
What are you up to?

59:30.701 --> 59:33.969
Uh, I'm actually prepping
my first documentary.

59:33.971 --> 59:36.104
- What? What??
- Yeah, yeah.

59:36.106 --> 59:39.708
Well it's early, I mean it's,
yeah, very early stages.

59:40.710 --> 59:43.278
That's amazing, that's
what you've always wanted.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.347
It's pretty cool, I
think it will be good.

59:50.120 --> 59:52.654
- Yeah, uh, we'll see.
- What is it about?

59:52.656 --> 59:57.926
Well it's, I don't wanna
it's love, really about love.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.194
How so?

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.897
I know this sounds lame
but I don't want to say

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:05.133
too much, I don't really
know how it's gonna end

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:07.703
but I'll invite you
to the premiere.

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:09.271
Oh that's very kind of you.

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.075
Can I ask you something?

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.811
You can ask me anything.

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:17.980
Are you happy?

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.618
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.387
Well, maybe there's a reason.

01:00:25.724 --> 01:00:26.623
Jesus!

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:29.958
You know what, I take that
back, you can't ask me anything.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.193
Oh my god.

01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:32.761
Come on, it's just a question.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:38.900
Okay happy, uh, I don't
know, I guess so.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:42.170
I mean what does that
mean? Am I smiling all day,

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:45.040
- am I laughing?
- No, no.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.775
I don't know. Are you happy?

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.078
Yeah I think I am.

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:56.718
That's great. That is great.

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.865
So you're really coming?

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:14.069
Would you...? Yeah I
am, I'm really coming.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:17.205
I'm here. Why?

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:21.009
You know I almost
didn't invite you.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.411
Why?

01:01:22.413 --> 01:01:25.013
Well, I don't know.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.015
You're...

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.084
You.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:34.756
Then I thought it would be
weirder if I didn't invite

01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:38.093
you like I was trying to
cut you out of my life or something.

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:42.330
Are you crazy, I gotta
be there. Your big day.

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:46.301
Don't wanna miss that.
I want to be there.

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:49.304
I know, I know, I just figured
I would invite you and it

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:51.873
- would be fine, or,
- it's gonna be fine.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.276
I'd never see you again, y'know?

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:57.479
Never see me again?

01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:59.448
Yeah, I mean probably, right?

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:04.252
You're a monster what
are you talking about?

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:08.156
That's crazy. Well I mean that's how life
is, isn't it? If you're not a part of

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:13.829
- these moments, it just...
- Alright hey, I'm coming, okay?

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:15.497
- I'm coming to the wedding.
- Good.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:21.269
Can't do that, can't leave
an Adam sized hole here.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.109
Never see you again, Jesus.

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:31.046
I, you know what I mean right?

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:32.013
Look I'm happy

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:34.316
- for you, really am.
- Yeah?

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:36.218
I am, I'm really happy for you!

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.988
I mean, I'm on a lot
of antidepressants but,

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.024
they're working, so.

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:45.193
You know I do miss you.

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:47.028
From time to time.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.501
Me too.

01:02:57.206 --> 01:03:00.308
Listen I should get going,
I'm gonna hop on a car

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.244
and head home, but I'll see you.

01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:05.046
Yeah... uh, you know
what I'm headed that way

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:06.915
myself so I'll just join you.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.417
- Yeah? Which way is that?
- Yeah.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:13.088
Which, which way
are you going again?

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:16.992
What?

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.001
<i>Guess I'd better get going.</i>

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.171
<i>So long.</i>

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:40.475
<i>I'll sell Lassie for
a hundred dollars.</i>

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:43.411
<i>- Deal.
- Lassie you're mine now!</i>

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.528
And so it is with blessed hearts

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.467
that we have
gathered here today.

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:15.644
To join this man and this
woman in holy matrimony.

01:05:20.217 --> 01:05:21.283
Okay, how do I look?

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.419
Like you're going to a funeral.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:31.126
- Wish me luck.
- Yeah good luck.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:40.502
A moment like this only
comes around once in a lifetime.

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:57.152
And indeed it is a rare
and beautiful thing when

01:05:57.154 --> 01:06:00.388
two people find in each other
such a perfect match, and

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:03.291
decide to share a
lifetime together.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.227
Wanna hold hands?

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:08.964
No.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:11.433
- Too soon?
- Yeah.

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:16.671
Allison and Aaron have
shown their love to be true.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:21.176
If there is anyone amongst
us that believes that

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:25.613
these two should not be
wed, speak now or forever

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.315
hold your peace.

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.490
Yeah I have something to say.

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:36.651
If there is anyone
amongst us that believes that

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:41.089
these two should not
be wed, speak now or

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:42.557
forever hold your peace.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.533
Sorry, sorry.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:56.371
- Do we have the ring?
- Yeah.

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:58.406
- You okay?
- Yeah I'm fine.

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:03.311
- You look nice.
- Thanks, thank you, you too.

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.647
- Aaron, do you take
- just cut a little...

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:08.216
- That's alright, it's okay.
- Allison as your wife

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:09.851
- oh look at that.
- In sickness and health

01:08:09.853 --> 01:08:13.388
thank you. For as long as you
both shall live?

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:14.689
I do.

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:16.691
So beautiful.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:21.462
Shhh. Yeah. And Allison, do you take
Aaron to be your husband

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:25.733
in sickness and in health
in good times and bad for

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.769
as long as you both shall live?

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.478
I do.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:42.550
Then by the power vested
in me, I now pronounce you

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:45.587
husband and wife and you
may now kiss the bride.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.488
- Here, let me pour this.
- You wanna do the honors here?

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:24.692
Nice, okay! Oh, sorry.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.496
You haven't touched your food.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:31.733
Huh?

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.201
Your food.

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:36.237
Oh yeah. Not hungry I guess.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.872
Isn't young love
a beautiful thing?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.542
- What's that?
- Young love.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:45.212
Young love! Yes, uh,
it's great. It's great.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.749
Is this your girlfriend?

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.419
No, her? No
she's not my girlfriend.

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:52.921
I just met her a few days ago.

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:55.957
She makes dolls for a living.

01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:57.959
- Oh that's nice.
- Yeah.

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:02.664
That is nice. It's nice.

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:04.532
Everything is nice at a wedding.

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.235
Have you noticed that?

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:09.537
Everything at a wedding's
nice, the food's nice,

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.473
the ceremony's nice,
it's just nice.

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:15.410
Can't all be that
nice, am I right?

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:20.915
Is it hot in here, are you
guys... it's hot, right?

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:23.318
You know what I mean, is it hot?

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.486
- I feel fine.
- I'm fine.

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:26.588
Of course you feel fine.

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:28.990
Everything's fine to you.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.626
What?

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:33.962
Nothing, I'm sorry,
I'm... sorry.

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:37.699
Thank you for coming.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.707
Alright, alright, it's
that time we invite our bride

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:48.776
and groom down for their
very first dance as

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:53.915
Mr. and Mrs.
Aaron Stoller!

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:56.651
Come on give it up for them!

01:10:58.288 --> 01:10:59.721
Look at this beautiful couple!

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:08.730
And now, for the
song that played

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:11.366
the very first time they met.

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:13.868
Here it is.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:57.786
I'll be right back.

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:05.987
Where are you going -?

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.614
'Sup man?

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:35.750
Oh hey, hey, what's up?

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.822
You look white as a ghost.
Somebody kill your cat?

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.926
My girlfriend's getting
married in there.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.761
Your girlfriend's
getting married??

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:48.663
Well, ex-girlfriend.

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:50.098
Oh shit.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.799
That's messed up.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:02.877
Why not. Thanks.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:03.879
Gotcha.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.517
- Better?
- Little bit.

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:13.421
- What's your name?
- Federico.

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:15.156
- Fredico?
- Federico.

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:16.657
- Federico.
- Yeah.

01:13:16.659 --> 01:13:19.160
- Adam.
- Adam, what's up.

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:24.165
What are you doing here if

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.868
your girlfriend's
getting married?

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:29.404
Oh, uh, she's not
my girl anymore,

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:33.141
and um, I'm happy for her.

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:36.978
- No I am.
- Yeah okay.

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.746
- I am.
- Uh huh.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.517
I believe you. I'm good.

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.756
You know I used to
have this goldfish.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.625
His name was tom petty.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.060
You named your
goldfish tom petty?

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:54.062
Yeah.

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.764
Pretty cool name for a goldfish.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.499
Yeah well he was
a cool goldfish.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:13:59.501
I bet.

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.804
Had tom petty for nine years.

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:06.040
Whoa. Yeah and one day I'm
cleaning out my sock

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:09.544
drawer, I turn, I look...

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.481
He's gone.

01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:15.783
Gone like someone stole him?

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.718
Gone like he died.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.154
Oh, yeah okay. Sorry.

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:23.491
So you know what I did then?

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:26.961
I ran down the block to
the pet store, got me

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.729
another fish.

01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:30.998
- Just like that?
- Just like that, man,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.168
just like that. I
loved tom petty.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:35.636
Who doesn't?

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.807
Heartbreakers.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:40.908
The best!

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:44.545
Yeah.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.049
'Lotta fish out there.

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:55.490
I see where you're
going with this.

01:14:55.492 --> 01:14:58.993
All due respect Frederico,
I think people are a

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.895
little harder than goldfish.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.163
Yeah maybe.

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:04.699
Tell you what
though, never gonna

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:06.767
have another tom petty again.

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:13.774
I do have a Bob Dylan though.

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.215
I really appreciate what
you're trying to do.

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.886
You're a good man.

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:26.988
- You're a wise man.
- Want to get high?

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.191
- Oh...
- Oh yeah.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.193
- No I probably shouldn't.
- You sure?

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:35.029
Yeah it might get a little
weird in there. But thank you.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.732
Alright, cool. That's alright. I
should go back inside, actually.

01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:38.766
Yeah. You can do this.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:42.103
You think?

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:45.039
You don't have to live
your life like a refugee.

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:48.276
Fuckin' tom petty.

01:15:48.278 --> 01:15:50.144
Tom petty.

01:15:50.181 --> 01:15:51.680
You mind if I get another

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:55.550
- little sip? Thanks.
- Bro, take two, take two.

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:57.752
Okay.

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.821
Okay? You good?

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:05.159
Thank you, really. Thanks.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.594
Go for it.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.670
Into the great wide open.

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:16.904
My man.

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.875
He's fucked.

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:23.611
I'll see if he's over there!

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:29.250
- Smile!
- No thanks. Fuckin'... okay.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.020
Thank you.

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:42.630
Oh shit.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:43.664
Excuse me.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.840
Adam.

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:53.842
Wendy.

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:55.643
What?

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.011
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

01:16:57.013 --> 01:16:59.380
Oh well here I am.

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:01.616
Honestly thought
you were a goner.

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:02.984
Totally thought you'd bail.

01:17:02.986 --> 01:17:03.851
What?

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:05.753
No, no.

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.254
You got balls.

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:08.256
Thanks!

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:11.292
And you look really handsome!

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:14.161
Thanks. I was just thinking
how pretty you looked.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:16.797
Ah yes, always the charmer.

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:18.366
Apparently not charming enough.

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.802
I'm kidding.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:24.939
This is, this is great,
it's really nice.

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:29.810
Yeah it's very nice,
everything is just so

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.679
nice.

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.267
- I was just saying that.
- Mm.

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:39.353
You know, how many people
can say that they're close

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:42.423
enough to go to each others'
weddings no matter what?

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:45.159
That's rare! You guys
have something special.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.794
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.396
You guys are always
gonna be friends.

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:54.035
Friends is, friends is good.

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:55.970
What's better than that?

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.408
You know, I was
always in your corner.

01:18:01.378 --> 01:18:02.277
Get outta here.

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:06.213
No really you were
always so sweet.

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:10.384
Aaron, is, he's just so
perfect, you know?

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:13.020
Right, who wants that?

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.789
- Sounds awful!
- You know what I mean!

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:19.894
No Aaron's good he's great
but you were just a little

01:18:19.896 --> 01:18:23.698
rough around the edges.
It's endearing really.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.768
Thanks, no I miss you guys.
I do. She looks beautiful,

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:29.770
- by the way.
- Yes she does.

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:31.772
She takes after her mother.

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:35.009
She does.

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:40.247
Uh oh. Wendy is there anything your
new son in law can't do?

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:43.184
Um, Susan, this is Adam.

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:46.887
Get your camera! Get your
camera, you gotta see this!

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.764
Needless to say I wanted
to do something special

01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:59.934
for the big day,
something personal.

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:02.303
But those of you who know
me, and I think a lot of

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:05.906
you do, you know that I'm
into learning new things.

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:09.343
He's good at everything.

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:12.213
Can't help it.

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:15.382
So I flew to Paris and I
studied at Jean Pierre's

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:19.453
culinary school Le petit
parodie for six weeks, five hours a day.

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:23.824
Hey, Allison loves all
things Paris, am I right?

01:19:23.826 --> 01:19:26.961
But I want to thank you
Jean-Pierre, for teaching

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:30.898
me that French baking is
an art, and it's an art

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.901
form and I know that now.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:37.772
- You are a natural.
- You're amazing.

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:38.806
You're amazing Aaron!

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.407
Come on Robbie!

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:43.077
Stop! What a dick.

01:19:44.347 --> 01:19:45.880
I'm just kidding.

01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:47.882
Nice, Aaron,
nice. Good one!

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:52.887
Without further ado, Allison,
baby, this is for you.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.260
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.062
Hope you all like cake.

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:08.169
Everybody have fun.

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:09.171
Cheers!

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:49.877
Oh ha ha. You're doing me?
Is that supposed to be me?

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:54.281
Yeah? Why don't you
finger my dickhole, pal?

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:56.550
Whoa.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.428
Oh boy.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:08.996
Do you want to dance?

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:09.998
Ugh.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.368
- Are you okay?
- Not really, Tallulah.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.470
I just thought maybe
you'd want to dance.

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:21.242
- Why would we do that?
- Because it could be fun.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.614
You know what?

01:21:26.616 --> 01:21:28.082
Fuck it.

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:29.984
Let's boogie.

01:21:32.889 --> 01:21:33.889
Sorry.

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:35.122
Come on.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:17.197
It'll all work out.

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:18.165
You think so?

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:19.533
Yeah.

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:22.569
Every setback in life's
an opportunity to grow.

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:27.574
That's stupid.

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.578
What are you like nine?

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.148
Call me when you get
some hair on your balls.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:55.602
I'm gonna tell you
something about love.

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:59.373
Love is shitty, shitty shit.

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:01.542
It's shitty.

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.478
I'm not supposed
to say that word.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.449
Yeah, well, you better start
'cause that's what love is.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.754
Shit.

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:16.357
There you go.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:58.399
Whoa whoa whoa
that's too much, baby!

01:23:58.401 --> 01:24:01.135
Come on, man!

01:24:18.621 --> 01:24:19.621
Fuck yeah!

01:24:29.532 --> 01:24:31.212
You're coming with me, baby.

01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:13.600
This thing
is so hard to walk in!

01:26:14.471 --> 01:26:15.370
Oh, god.

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:17.638
Have you seen your grandmother?

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.839
Yeah, I know.

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:22.643
She's had a few to drink.

01:26:22.645 --> 01:26:24.378
Just a little.

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:28.749
Okay girl, I'll
see you out there.

01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:29.883
Yeah, I just need a minute.

01:26:29.885 --> 01:26:30.751
I'm sorry.

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:33.320
Thank you!

01:26:53.976 --> 01:26:55.375
Jesus!

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.612
What are, what are
you doing in here?

01:26:58.614 --> 01:26:59.913
What are you doing in here?

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:03.650
You're wasted.

01:27:03.652 --> 01:27:04.851
No I'm not.

01:27:04.853 --> 01:27:06.453
I'm a little drunk.

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.423
Scale of one to ten
how happy are you? Go!

01:27:09.425 --> 01:27:11.758
- Whoa...
- Don't even think about it!

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.040
Is it the best day of your life?

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:16.763
- Pretty close.
- Whaaat?

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:19.366
That's so, that's good.

01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:21.301
That's really good.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:25.772
Can I, can I ask you something?

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:28.709
Maybe.

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:32.546
- Maybe don't.
- Why didn't we do this?

01:27:32.548 --> 01:27:35.482
- Adam...
- No really why didn't,

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:37.451
why didn't it work?

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:38.685
We could have done this.

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:41.355
You know what, I
can't answer that.

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.727
We should have done this.

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.837
You know they were playing
that John Mayer song and I

01:27:56.839 --> 01:28:00.741
was thinking about that
day that I had my molar

01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:05.379
removed and I was all hopped
up on Vicodin, and I was

01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:08.582
jumping on your bed singing
'my body is a wonderland.'

01:28:08.584 --> 01:28:11.018
- I remember, yeah.
- And I started singing

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:15.922
songs about like,
the fate of my tooth.

01:28:15.924 --> 01:28:18.325
Remember that? The,
like what was going

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:20.527
to happen to him after
he was out of my mouth.

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:25.432
- Timmy.
- Timmy the tooth.

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.068
And you kept taking
pictures of me on that

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:29.569
Polaroid camera.

01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:34.041
I remember you looking at
one and you said 'i can't

01:28:34.043 --> 01:28:38.045
believe this is the
man I'm gonna marry.'

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:45.352
'i can't believe this is
the man I'm gonna marry.'

01:28:45.354 --> 01:28:46.953
you said it.

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.893
Yeah I remember that. I
still have the picture.

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:56.563
You do?

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.066
Well, um...

01:28:59.068 --> 01:29:00.767
Adam, I can't do this right now.

01:29:00.769 --> 01:29:02.035
Please.

01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:05.372
If not now, when? When, so...?

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:06.707
Okay, um...

01:29:09.744 --> 01:29:12.079
- It wasn't just one thing.
- How many things was it?

01:29:12.081 --> 01:29:15.349
Okay you were there, it was
a combination of different

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:16.783
things and it...

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.621
What are you doing?
What is this?

01:29:21.623 --> 01:29:23.757
- What is, wait...
- Are you okay?

01:29:23.759 --> 01:29:25.359
You're just gonna ambush
me in the bathroom?

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:28.695
Ambush? Yeah you're ambushing. Oh, get
outta here this is not an ambush.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.697
You know I knew you were
gonna do this, I knew it.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:31.898
Then why did you
invite me if you

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.668
knew I was gonna do this? Because Adam I
thought that I could invite you and...

01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:36.703
No I know, because,
because, there's

01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:39.806
a part of you that wanted me to.

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:43.477
I think some part of you,
some part of you wanted me

01:29:43.479 --> 01:29:46.012
to save you from making the
biggest mistake of your life.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:51.818
Because some part of
you knows what I know.

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.987
And what is that?

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.992
That you're an alien
from another planet.

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:01.061
- Oh my god.
- You are.

01:30:01.063 --> 01:30:03.130
And the only other alien from

01:30:03.132 --> 01:30:05.732
your planet on this earth...

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.436
Is me.

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:14.574
Adam, you romanticize the past.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:17.110
I mean it wasn't, it
wasn't all perfect.

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:19.012
I know, I know.

01:30:19.014 --> 01:30:22.449
But it was, it was
pretty damn good.

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:25.685
It was pretty good.

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.789
It was alright.

01:30:28.791 --> 01:30:31.792
- We used to laugh so much.
- We did used to laugh a lot.

01:30:31.794 --> 01:30:33.460
You dummy.

01:30:34.863 --> 01:30:36.463
You dumb.

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:40.734
Adam.

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:42.869
What?

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:44.438
I'm sorry.

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.841
Why'd you do that?

01:30:47.843 --> 01:30:51.912
I thought, I was trying
to, I'm getting you back.

01:30:51.914 --> 01:30:54.514
No! You're not!

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:56.683
Why not?

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:10.197
I, is he, we were good, is
he that much better than me?

01:31:10.199 --> 01:31:12.132
- Adam...
- No really, really!

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:14.835
He plays tennis, he's great
at tennis! Is it because

01:31:14.837 --> 01:31:17.070
- I don't play tennis??
- Keep your voice down please!

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:27.247
You know I asked you here...

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.918
Maybe, maybe I shouldn't have.

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:39.226
I asked you here because I
thought you could be my friend.

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:44.097
I really didn't want to
hurt you, I, I don't know,

01:31:44.099 --> 01:31:49.269
I just, I just wanted
you to be here.

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:52.606
And I wanted you
to be part of this.

01:31:52.608 --> 01:31:55.075
You just don't
change, Adam, and...

01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:59.179
I, I did.

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:04.017
And I'm sorry. So sorry.

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:06.253
I'm...

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:10.263
I just want you to know that...

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:14.995
Oh.

01:32:14.997 --> 01:32:17.597
Hey. Hey, your dad wants
to give a toast.

01:32:17.599 --> 01:32:19.833
- Yeah.
- Aaron's looking for you.

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:23.603
- Wait, wait! Just one...
- No.

01:32:32.581 --> 01:32:36.750
Hey hey look at you!

01:32:36.752 --> 01:32:38.885
It couldn't get any
better than this!

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:40.287
I don't think there's
another man in the whole

01:32:40.289 --> 01:32:44.958
wide world as suited for
my daughter as Aaron.

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.593
Aaron!

01:32:46.595 --> 01:32:49.129
You've become like a son to me.

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:50.630
You're not so much
of a fisherman!

01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:55.135
But I think there's time.

01:32:55.137 --> 01:33:00.907
Because I know today is
just the first in many

01:33:00.909 --> 01:33:06.046
happy days to come, and
so let us raise a glass!

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:12.319
Here's to the rest of your life!

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:26.833
Wow.

01:33:39.615 --> 01:33:41.147
Way to go dipshit.

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.196
Whoa.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:01.267
Whoa whoa whoa, easy does it.

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:12.746
Wait wait wait wait!

01:34:12.748 --> 01:34:14.247
Shhhh.

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.292
Oh!

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:30.864
Aaron.

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:34.367
Actually really good.

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:01.054
I'm okay.

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:07.761
I'm sorry.

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:16.402
Bye.
