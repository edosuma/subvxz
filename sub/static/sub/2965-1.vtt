<i>with his new wife, Marjorie,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.807
<i>Plus Richard, Marjorie's son.</i>

04:19.760 --> 04:22.359
<i>For the most part, my mother
never mentioned my father,</i>

04:22.360 --> 04:25.599
<i>or the woman he was married to now.</i>

04:25.600 --> 04:27.801
<i>GERALD: You could always come
live with Marjorie and me.</i>

04:28.120 --> 04:31.759
I mean, if that was something you
wanted, we can have her evaluated.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.279
No. Mom is great.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.039
She's learning to play the cello.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.039
I just asked because
I get the feeling her...

04:40.040 --> 04:42.447
(SIGHS) That she's getting worse.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.279
<i>ADULT HENRY: I don't think losing
my father broke my mother's heart</i>

04:46.280 --> 04:48.847
<i>but rather, losing love itself.</i>

04:50.280 --> 04:52.239
<i>Even at that age, I understood this</i>

04:52.240 --> 04:54.879

some of the neglect.</i>

04:54.880 --> 04:56.491

04:59.400 --> 05:01.841
- You made all this for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

I made her a coupon book.</i>

- I cleaned.
- "One week of clean dishes."

05:17.800 --> 05:19.843
<i>I even took her on a date.</i>

05:21.800 --> 05:25.159
A man should know how to dance.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.126
When a man can dance,
the world is his oyster.

05:29.480 --> 05:33.079
<i>Some men just set their hand on
your shoulder or against your back</i>

05:33.080 --> 05:36.887
<i>but there has to be
strong pressure there.</i>

05:37.840 --> 05:40.079
<i>ADULT HENRY: At the time,
I was too young to understand</i>

05:40.080 --> 05:44.359
<i>the part of being husband for a day,
I was not equipped to carry out.</i>

05:44.360 --> 05:48.406
<i>But I sensed my own
terrible inadequacy.</i>

05:50.120 --> 05:54.564
<i>I could feel her loneliness and
longing before I had a name for it.</i>

06:20.560 --> 06:23.199
BANK TELLER:
Hey, Henry. How's your mother?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.401
Fine.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.525
I hope to see her in
here one of these days.

<i>only leaving the house once a month
to pick up supplies at Pricemart.</i>

07:20.600 --> 07:22.404
I think it's this way.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.484
Is it all right if I go
check out the comics?

07:37.560 --> 07:39.046
Um...

07:39.440 --> 07:42.484
Okay. Just don't wander.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.685
I'll be right over there.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.282
I wonder if you could
give me a hand here.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.159
You're bleeding.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.159
Yeah, well, I fell out a window.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.839
We should get help.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.279
No, I wouldn't want
to upset anyone.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.642
Did you come here with
that woman over there?

08:43.960 --> 08:45.321
My mom.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.804
She looks like the kind of
person that could help me.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.319
I... I don't know.

08:51.320 --> 08:55.002
What I want to ask is,
you think she'd give me a ride?

08:57.160 --> 08:58.521
Hmm?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.762
This is my mother, Adele.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.604
Mom, this is Frank.
He needs our help.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.759
You got a good boy here, Adele.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.042
He was kind enough
to offer me a ride.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.521
Oh.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.880
Um...

09:44.760 --> 09:47.645
Well, he may have, but...

09:47.920 --> 09:51.806
We have a big afternoon.
I don't think we can help you.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.290
Well, that's a shame.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.130
I thought we could have a catch.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.970
- I suck at baseball.
- Hey.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.721
Maybe you used to.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.122
Don't you throw around
a ball with your dad?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.599
I only see him on Sundays.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.039
- Oh.
- ADELE: No. I'm sorry.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.159
I won't be any trouble.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.283

How do you, uh, take your coffee?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.165
As is.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.606
- How did you hurt your leg?
- (SIGHS)

13:50.520 --> 13:53.405
I'm going to be straight
with you, here, Henry.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.244
I'm not going to lie.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.759
I hurt my leg jumping out of a
second floor window at a hospital

14:00.760 --> 14:03.566
they'd taken me to to
get my appendix out.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.764
At the prison.
That's how I got out.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.441
When?

14:09.760 --> 14:11.041
This morning.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.930
You escaped?

14:15.080 --> 14:16.930
So, now, the police
are looking for you.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.959
I would have gotten further
except for the damn leg.

I'd be grateful if you let
me stay till nightfall.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.999
I'd try and help out.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.123
I wouldn't ask anything of you.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.810
You just did.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.647
Nothing more than a place to lay low
and rest my leg for a few hours.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.439
How do I...

15:01.440 --> 15:03.642
How do I know you won't hurt us?

15:06.600 --> 15:10.009
I've never intentionally
hurt anyone in my life.

15:11.600 --> 15:16.010
You understand how that
could be hard to believe.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.330
Yeah, I do.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.931
How far are the train
tracks from your backyard?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.601
Running?

15:43.400 --> 15:45.284
Twenty minutes, maybe.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.879
People come over. Often. Randomly.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.999
Friends, salesmen,
religious people.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.919
I'll make a run for it tonight and I
can stay out of your way until then.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.839
I mean, they'd notice
if I went quiet.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.719
Even for a little bit.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.119
I just escaped from prison.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.239
The last place
I want to go is back.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.761
I'm stronger than you think.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.964
I don't doubt that.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.566

around the house?

- Hey.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.959
<i>When I visited my mother,
she would act busy and distracted.</i>

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.479
<i>Calls to make, chores to do.</i>

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:22.799
<i>I think my presence
made her uncomfortable.</i>

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.606
<i>A strange reminder
of what was missing.</i>

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:30.207
All those two had was each other.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.364
That was enough.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.359
<i>By my junior year,</i>

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:48.167
<i>people hardly brought up the events
leading up to seventh grade.</i>

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.570
<i>For the first time, I had
someone to call a girlfriend.</i>

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.529
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.319
There's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.364
Oh, Dad, please. We're
having such a pleasant time.

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.039
Everybody talks about all
this crazy, wild passion.

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:33.403
That's how it goes in
the songs. You know.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.284
Your mother was like that.

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.399
She was in love with love.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.728
She couldn't do anything partway.

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.602
She was a terrific woman.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.286
Funny.

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.285
So beautiful.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:06.126
A better man might have stayed around
and helped her through all that sadness.

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.408
But I couldn't bear it.

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:13.122
I just wanted a regular life.

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:21.490
I don't know what these last
few years have done to repair,

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.649
but I'm sorry I cut out on you.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.485
It's okay.

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.482
I'm going to get the check.

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.559
<i>ADULT HENRY:
The next day, when I suggested</i>

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:48.239
<i>I move back in with my mother
for the rest of senior year,</i>

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.090
<i>he didn't argue.</i>

01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:58.279
<i>And it was there in my mom's
kitchen, my final summer at home,</i>

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.165
<i>that I first tried
my hand at baking.</i>

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.891
FRANK: Dear Henry.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.679
<i>I hope you will remember me.</i>

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:12.479
<i>We once spent Labor
Day weekend together.</i>

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.251
<i>Five of the best days of my life.</i>

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.879
<i>I had always wondered who you would
become and what you would look like.</i>

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:25.608
<i>And then one day, I came
across a familiar-looking pie.</i>

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.568
<i>And there you were.</i>

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.245
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.079
<i>I will understand if you choose
not to respond to this letter.</i>

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.409
<i>However, I am due to
be released shortly.</i>

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:48.047
<i>I am no longer young, but I have
plenty of good health remaining.</i>

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.319
<i>And I'd like to live much
the same way we discussed</i>

01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.649
<i>that weekend back when we
thought we'd be a family.</i>

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.599
<i>Most likely, your mother
has remarried by now.</i>

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.963
<i>But on the off chance
that she might be alone,</i>

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.599
<i>I wanted to ask you whether
I might write her a letter.</i>

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.959
<i>I promise you,</i>

01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.245
<i>I would sooner cut off my own hand
than bring any more grief to Adele.</i>

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.359
<i>ADULT HENRY:
I wrote him back that day</i>

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.769
<i>to say that it wouldn't be
difficult to locate my mother.</i>

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.486
<i>She lived at the same address.</i>

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.323
(SOBBING)

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.639
<i>ADULT HENRY: I spent half of
my life worrying my mother</i>

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:22.003
<i>wouldn't be able to go out
into the world on her own.</i>

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.441
<i>But as it turned out,
she wouldn't have to.</i>
