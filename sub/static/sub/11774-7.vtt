WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:08.376
( theme music playing )

00:11.579 --> 00:13.847
- Nat: I THINK DOWN THERE.
- REALLY?

00:13.947 --> 00:16.050
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN YEARS.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.018
- THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.
- Larry: THIS IS IT?

00:18.119 --> 00:21.255
- YEAH, HERE.
- Larry: THIS IS MOM'S GRAVE?

00:23.191 --> 00:24.525
Larry:
"PAST AWAY"?

00:24.625 --> 00:25.926
P-A-S-T?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.028
DAD, YOU SPELLED
"PASSED" WRONG.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.997
IT'S NOT SPELLED
P-A-S-T.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.766
"PASSED AWAY."
P-A-S-S-E-D.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.635
I KNOW HOW
TO SPELL IT.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.470
THAT'S $50
A LETTER.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.539
YOU SPELLED IT WRONG
ON PURPOSE TO SAVE $100?!

00:38.639 --> 00:39.773
YES, WHY NOT?

00:39.873 --> 00:42.510
IT HAS THE SAME MEANING.
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.613
- IT'S NOT THE SAME MEANING.
- YOU SAVED $100?!

00:45.713 --> 00:47.181
I WOULD'VE PAID FOR IT.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.350
- I-I--
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:49.450 --> 00:52.220
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.388
THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.390
HONESTLY, THIS IS
NOT THE NICEST WAY...

00:56.490 --> 00:57.991
- THIS IS INSANE.
- ...TO HONOR YOUR WIFE.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.894
OKAY, I'M SORRY.
I GOTTA CHANGE THIS.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.396
YOU GOT THE NAME
OF THE STONEMASON?

01:02.496 --> 01:05.065
YES, I HAVE THE NAME
OF THE STONEMASON, YES.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.935
I'M GONNA SPELL IT
THE RIGHT WAY.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.304
AND WHAT ABOUT SOME
BLANDISHMENTS ON HERE?

01:10.404 --> 01:13.607
HOW ABOUT "DEVOTED WIFE"?
SOME ADJECTIVES?

01:13.707 --> 01:15.609
"BELOVED MOTHER OF LARRY"
WOULD'VE BEEN NICE.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.480
YOU WANTED
MAYBE $6,000 MORE
ON THE STONE?

01:19.580 --> 01:23.384
WHY NOT JUST "ADELE DAVID
BORN, PASSED AWAY"?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.500
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE
TO STAY HERE?

01:43.337 --> 01:46.006
- P-A-S-T PAST.
- "PAST AWAY."

01:46.106 --> 01:49.577
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
- GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT THAT
MAN HAS LET GO THROUGH.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.679
LUCKY HE DIDN'T PUT
"BELOVED MOTH."

01:51.779 --> 01:54.114
( all chuckle )

01:54.215 --> 01:56.850
HEY HEY HEY.
NORM'S HERE.
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY UP.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.887
LET'S EAT.
LET'S ORDER.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.423
Marty:
HE'S THE SLOWEST GOLFER
IN THE UNITED STATES.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.658
LET'S ORDER BREAKFAST
AND BEAT HIM TO THE FIRST TEE.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.560
- YEAH, COME ON.
- WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

02:06.660 --> 02:09.463
I'M GONNA HAVE
EGG WHITES WITH A BAGEL.
QUICKLY, PLEASE.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.699
- I'LL HAVE SUNNY-SIDE EGGS.
- JUST A FRUIT PLATE.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.803
I'D LIKE THE SAME THING--
EGG WHITES WITH LOX
AND WELL-DONE ONIONS.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.938
I DON'T WANT THEM LIMP.
I REALLY WANT THEM CRISPY.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.807
ANDY, ANDY,
DO ME A FAVOR.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.243
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO GET CRISPY ONIONS.
- NO, THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.078
NO NO, IT TAKES
A LONG TIME TO GET
ONIONS WELL-DONE.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.515
BELIEVE ME.
I'VE ORDERED THIS BEFORE.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WANT.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.850
- I KNOW, BUT THEY
TAKE A LONG TIME.
- THANK YOU.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.919
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- IT TAKES A LONG TIME.

02:32.019 --> 02:34.255
- STOP IT. YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
- I DO KNOW.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.923
- I MAKE ONIONS AT HOME.
- SO I'LL ONLY EAT HALF.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.559
- DON'T WORRY.
- YOU HAVE NEVER
PLAYED BEHIND NORM.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.893
- HEY, JIM.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.462
- HOW ARE YOU?
- NOT BAD.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.863
- JUST IN TOWN FOR THE DAY.
- GOING BACK TO NEW YORK?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.131
YEAH, TAKING
A RED-EYE TONIGHT.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.866
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.135
- TAKE CARE.
- TAKE CARE.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.438
WHY DIDN'T YOU
INTRODUCE US?

02:50.538 --> 02:51.939
HE'S FROM NEW YORK.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
SEE HIM AGAIN.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.841
IT'S A COURTEOUS
THING TO DO.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.443
- WHAT, DO YOU
HAVE TO KNOW HIS NAME?
- I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW IT.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.345
HE HAS TO KNOW YOUR NAME
AND SHAKE YOUR HAND?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.347
IT'S A COMMON COURTESY
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
TO SOMEONE.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.682
IT'S A POINTLESS
AND UNNECESSARY
SOCIAL CONVENTION...

03:01.782 --> 03:05.319
- ( cell phone ringing )
- ...TO INTRODUCE EVERY
SINGLE PERSON YOU KNOW.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.192
HELLO?
OH, HEY, DAD.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.262
I CAN'T TALK HERE.
I'M IN THE DINING ROOM.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.696
YOU SHOULDN'T USE
THE PHONE IN HERE.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.232
- HOME FOR DINNER
TONIGHT AT 6:30.
- KEEP IT DOWN.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.033
COME ON.
TELL HIM YOU'LL
CALL HIM BACK.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.870
GREAT.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.173
NO CELL PHONE
IN DINING ROOM.
CLUB RULE.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.308
WHY YOU BREAK RULE?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.677
OH. I'M SORRY,
MR. TAKAHASHI.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.280
MY FATHER HAD A QUADRUPLE
BYPASS SURGERY YESTERDAY

03:32.380 --> 03:35.182
AND HE NEEDED
TO HEAR MY VOICE.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.918
YOU DO THIS ALL TIME.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.488
LAST WARNING.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.457
SORRY.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.961
- WHO THE HELL IS HE?
- MR. TAKAHASHI.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.963
- HE'S THE OWNER.
- OF THE CLUB?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.499
- YEAH.
- OH BOY.

04:00.841 --> 04:04.244
WILL YOU PLEASE FINISH
SHOVELING THAT SHIT
INTO YOUR FACE?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.679
IT'S EXACTLY
HOW I WANTED IT DONE.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.247
I TOLD YOU THOSE ONIONS
WERE GONNA TAKE 10-15 MINUTES.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.149
A COUPLE OF MINUTES
LONGER THAN YOU GUYS.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.084
IT WASN'T A COUPLE
OF MINUTES. WE'VE BEEN
DONE FOR FIVE.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.820
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S HIT IT.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.623
WHAT DOES IT MATTER NOW?
WHAT DOES IT MATTER NOW?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.891
- NO, IT'S OVER.
- MAYBE THEY'RE GOING
TO THE RANGE.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.394
NO, THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO THE RANGE.
THEY DON'T GO TO THE RANGE.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.196
- THANKS, GENTLEMEN.
- YEAH, I GOT IT.
DON'T WORRY.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.965
- THANKS, LARR.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:25.065 --> 04:28.569
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO HERE?
IT'S AN 18% TIP INCLUDED.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.671
AND THEN THEY HAVE A SPACE
FOR AN ADDITIONAL TIP.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.706
I HAVE TO START DOING MATH
IN MY HEAD NOW?

04:32.806 --> 04:34.708
AND THEN-- WHAT DOES IT
COME OUT TO? $2?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.644
I'M LEAVING AN EXTRA $2?
THAT MAKES ME LOOK CHEAP.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.011
JUST LEAVE THE 18%
AND LET'S GO.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.680
I THINK THAT'S
ALL THEY EXPECT.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.416
I'M NOT LEAVING ANY MORE
ADDITIONAL TIPS HERE.
I'M PROTESTING IT.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.585
I SWEAR TO YOU
I'M GONNA PROTEST IT.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.420
- I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT.
- Jeff: I'M GONNA FOLLOW
YOUR LEAD.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.221
- Marty: IT'S A GOOD PROTEST.
- THIS IS CRAZY.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.558
- YOU READY?
- YEAH, WE'RE READY.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.426
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
COME ON.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.229
- THANKS AGAIN, GUYS.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.398
HAVE A GOOD ROUND.

04:57.498 --> 05:02.336
WHOA. WAS-- WAS
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.338
- YEAH, GOOD JOB.
- THANKS.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.540
UM, SEE, 'CAUSE YOU
DIDN'T LEAVE A TIP.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.976
AND USUALLY WHEN I'VE
PROVIDED EXCELLENT SERVICE,

05:09.076 --> 05:10.744
MY CUSTOMERS LIKE
TO TIP ME.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.513
WELL, THERE IS
AN 18% TIP INCLUDED.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.848
GENERALLY, I DO LEAVE
AN ADDITIONAL TIP,

05:14.948 --> 05:18.419
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M KIND OF PROTESTING
THE ADDITIONAL TIP.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.621
- I DON'T CARE FOR IT.
- YOU'RE PROTESTING.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.491
YES.
LET 'EM CHARGE ME 20%.
LET 'EM CHARGE ME 25%.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.594
I'D RATHER BE CHARGED
A 30% TIP INCLUDED

05:26.694 --> 05:30.598
THAN HAVE TO ADD UP
18% TO 20% TO 25%--
WHATEVER.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.900
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH.
IT'S 2%.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.637
- IT'S HARD TO GET TO 2%.
- YOU TAKE 1%, JUST MOVE
THE DECIMAL PLACE TWO SPOTS.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.039
OKAY, YOU HAVE A SYSTEM.
I DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM

05:39.139 --> 05:40.508
TO GET TO 2%.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.210
YOU KNOW, DON'T MAKE ME
DO MATH AT THE TABLE.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.245
SO YOU'RE PROTESTING MATH.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.648
I'M PROTESTING MATH.
EXACTLY.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.699
- BOY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
- THIS IS INSANE.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.367
20 MINUTES HE'S LOOKING
FOR THIS BALL.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.637
I KNOW.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.073
HEY, NORM,
DROP A BALL.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.208
- HUH?
- YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR 20 MINUTES.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.778
- JUST DROP A BALL.
- I HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING
FOR 20 MINUTES.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.648
YOU CAN'T HOLD UP
THE WHOLE COURSE LIKE THIS!
LET US PLAY THROUGH!

06:20.748 --> 06:23.316
YOU DON'T PLAY THROUGH.
OUT OF THE QUESTION!

06:23.417 --> 06:25.486
IT'S NOT RIGHT!
IT'S VERY INCONSIDERATE!

06:25.586 --> 06:27.555
I'M NOT INCONSIDERATE!
YOU'RE INCONSIDERATE!

06:27.655 --> 06:29.457
- YOU'RE INCONSIDERATE!
- NO, YOU ARE!

06:29.557 --> 06:31.258
- YOU WANT TO DO ME A FAVOR?
- YEAH YEAH.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.561
- SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS.
- ARE YOU HAPPY YOU HAD
THE ONIONS?!

06:33.661 --> 06:35.463
HUH?! ARE YOU GLAD
YOU HAD THE ONIONS?!

06:35.563 --> 06:37.531
I CAN'T FIND
THE GODDAMN BALL!

06:37.631 --> 06:39.967
- LET'S GO!
- DON'T BE ANGRY AT ME JUST
'CAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY AT HIM.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.437
- WE'LL COME BACK TOMORROW.
- I COME HERE TO RELAX,
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME!

06:43.537 --> 06:45.272
CRISPY ONIONS!
THEY HAVE TO BE CRISPY!

06:45.372 --> 06:47.140
"I CAN'T EAT BREAKFAST

06:47.240 --> 06:48.408
UNLESS I HAVE
CRISPY ONIONS!"

06:48.509 --> 06:50.678
- HOW'S YOUR WIFE?
- FUCK YOU, NORM!

06:52.846 --> 06:57.017
- THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
- YEAH, WHAT A TIME.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.819
HEY, YOU!

06:58.919 --> 07:00.488
YES, YOU.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.523
DID YOU HAVE TO
YELL AND SCREAM
AT NORM OUT THERE?

07:02.623 --> 07:04.858
- DID YOU?
- YEAH, I DID HAVE
TO YELL AND SCREAM.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.094
YOU GUYS ARE THE SLOWEST
FOURSOME IN THE CLUB.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.529
YOU'RE VERY
INCONSIDERATE.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.664
HE'S LOOKING FOR A BALL
FOR HALF AN HOUR.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.400
YOU DON'T YELL
AT SOMEBODY WHO HAS
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.302
I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAS
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.304
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU YELL AT SOMEBODY
WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?

07:17.404 --> 07:18.739
THEY HAVE A HEART ATTACK
AND THEY DIE.

07:18.839 --> 07:22.109
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.
NORM IS DEAD.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.580
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.649
SO YOU'RE BLAMING ME?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.651
- YES!
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT

07:30.751 --> 07:32.185
THAT HE HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.188
- DID YOU EVEN KNOW HIM?
- I DID KNOW HIM SOMEWHAT.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.758
- DID YOU LIKE HIM AT ALL?
- NO, I THOUGHT HE WAS
A PRICK.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.827
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S INTERESTING

07:39.927 --> 07:42.930
BECAUSE I HEARD SO MANY
STORIES ABOUT YOU WHEN
I JOINED THIS CLUB

07:43.030 --> 07:46.099
AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE
THAT THEY WERE ALL TRUE
ABOUT ONE HUMAN BEING.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.636
NOW I KNOW
THAT EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE HEARD

07:48.736 --> 07:50.671
- IS TRUE.
- WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.640
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?
TELL ME WHAT YOU HEARD.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.578
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE GETTING
QUITE A REPUTATION

07:57.678 --> 07:59.379
- HERE AT THE CLUB.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.915
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- LOOK, IT MAY HAVE BEEN
AN ACCIDENT,

08:02.015 --> 08:04.518
- BUT YOU'RE A MURDERER.
- HOW DARE YOU?!

08:04.618 --> 08:06.153
NO, YOU'RE NOT A MURDERER.
YOU'RE NOT A MURDERER.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.788
IT'S INVOLUNTARY
MANSLAUGHTER.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.623
YOU DIDN'T
INTEND TO KILL HIM,
BUT YOU KILLED HIM.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.759
- I DIDN'T KILL HIM!
- I'M NOT POINTING FINGERS,

08:11.859 --> 08:12.960
BUT YOU KILLED HIM.
YOU DID!

08:13.060 --> 08:14.528
HEY, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING:

08:14.628 --> 08:16.463
THE MINUTE YOU WANTED
THOSE CRISPY ONIONS,

08:16.564 --> 08:18.198
YOU PUT A GUN
TO THAT GUY'S HEAD.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.500
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF HE HADN'T ORDERED
THOSE EGGS THAT WAY,

08:20.601 --> 08:24.504
YOU WOULDN'T BE GUILTY
OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.276
WHAT TIME ARE WE
PLAYING TOMORROW?

08:29.376 --> 08:31.979
- EARLY. YUP.
- EARLY. YEAH.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.280
EARLY.
GOOD IDEA.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.251
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
THE "SEINFELD" REUNION?
ARE THEY ALL DOING IT?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.420
YEAH, THE READ-THROUGH
IS NEXT WEEK.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.656
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
- YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

08:42.756 --> 08:46.159
OOH, THE STONEMASON CALLED
AND HE SAID HE'LL CALL BACK.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.095
I PICKED UP THE PHONE.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.731
OH, AND WHILE
I WAS ON THE PHONE,
I THINK I SOLD HIM A HAT.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.600
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- ON THE PHONE.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.968
THE STONEMASON IS GONNA
BUY A HAT FROM YOU?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.437
- WHAT KIND OF HAT?
- NAT, YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN HER HATS?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.306
OH MY GOSH,
WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS!

08:59.406 --> 09:01.174
WHAT SHE DOES--
SHE'S SO CREATIVE!

09:01.274 --> 09:02.576
SHE ASTOUNDS ME.
LOOK AT THIS.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.311
THIS IS WHAT
I LIVE TO DO.
IT'S MY PASSION.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.915
RIGHT,
SO HOW DO YOU GET TO
TAKE CARE OF YOUR BABY?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.883
I HAVE TO WORK.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.185
LISTEN, KIDS COST
A LOT OF MONEY NOWADAYS.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.955
WE GOT HEALTH INSURANCE
AND SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.758
IT'S TOUGH TO LIVE IN
NEW YORK. WE'RE SAVING
ALREADY FOR COLLEGE.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.227
OKAY. YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.632
I'M GONNA PAY FOR SKYLAR
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.167
- OH, CUT IT OUT.
- LARRY.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.536
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

09:29.637 --> 09:31.772
- YEAH, I'M GONNA DO IT.
- THAT'S--

09:31.872 --> 09:33.540
I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS.
I HAVE MONEY.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.475
I'LL DO IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.712
- BY GOLLY. OH MY GOD!
- THAT'S EVERYTHING!

09:38.812 --> 09:40.547
- THAT'S EVERYTHING.
- UNCLE NAT, LOOK WHO
YOU RAISED.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.951
- YES, I'M LOOKIN' AT HIM.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.352
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A THANK-YOU HAT.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.754
DON'T MAKE ME
A THANK-YOU HAT.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.521
- IT'S DONE.
- ( phone ringing )

09:48.622 --> 09:50.423
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
BE A GREAT THING THAT
YOU COULD DO?

09:50.523 --> 09:53.226
IF YOU COULD
SHOW IT TO SOME OF
YOUR CELEBRITY FRIENDS,

09:53.326 --> 09:58.065
- LIKE JERRY SEINFELD.
- JERRY SEINFELD IS NOT
GONNA WEAR THAT HAT.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.100
- YOU DON'T KNOW!
- YEAH, I DO KNOW.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.601
OR SOME ATHLETE FRIEND?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.104
- HELLO.
- Hey, it's Ed--
the stonemason.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.240
OH, HEY.
SO I WANT YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR

10:07.340 --> 10:10.844
- AND CHANGE THE INSCRIPTION
ON MY MOTHER'S STONE.
- Okay.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.846
OKAY, WELL YOU KNOW
"PASSED AWAY"

10:12.946 --> 10:15.482
IS WRITTEN ON THERE
SPELLED P-A-S-T?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.050
WHO WAS THAT YANKEE
YOU HAD ON "SEINFELD"?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.152
- DEREK JETER?
- HE COULD WEAR ONE.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.354
That guy sucks.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.156
- WHO SUCKS?
- Derek Jeter.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.058
He's the most overrated
player in baseball.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.360
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- I can't stand Derek Jeter.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.163
You know he's the worst
offensive shortstop in
baseball statistically?

10:30.263 --> 10:33.300
OH, BULLSHIT.
HE'S A GREAT CLUTCH HITTER.
HE'S A GREAT CLUTCH PLAYER.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.068
LARRY, COME ON BACK.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.837
There's no way
he deserves that kind
of money he's making.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.207
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO ME A FAVOR

10:40.307 --> 10:42.509
AND JUST TAKE CARE
OF THE STONE, PLEASE?

10:42.609 --> 10:45.212
- Will do.
- THANK YOU.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.082
- HOW GREAT IS THIS DAY?
- GORGEOUS.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.852
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
YESTERDAY IT WAS PACKED.
NOBODY'S HERE.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.687
I THINK IT'S OUT
OF RESPECT FOR NORM.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.990
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE HOLE THAT NORM
HAD THE HEART ATTACK ON.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.591
- THIS IS THE HOLE?
- THIS IS THE HOLE.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.160
- WOW.
- YEAH.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.965
OH, GOD DAMN IT.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.967
A GOOD SWING;
YOU CAME OVER IT.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.969
- WHAT AM I DOING?
- YOU CAME OVER THE TOP OF IT.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.738
RIGHT BY THE POND.
YOU'RE RIGHT BY THE POND.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.372
ENJOY THE SWANS.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.152
( swan trumpeting )

11:31.591 --> 11:34.461
( trumpeting )

11:44.571 --> 11:47.107
HEY! HEY!

11:47.207 --> 11:49.409
HEY!
HEY!

11:49.509 --> 11:51.211
HEY!

11:58.085 --> 12:00.888
AND THEN I LOOKED UP
AND HE STARTED COMING
TOWARDS ME.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.356
( stammers )
HE ATTACKED ME!
HE LEAPT AT ME!

12:03.456 --> 12:05.225
- DID YOU PROVOKE HIM?
- NO, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.895
YOU KNOW THIS IS
TAKAHASHI'S PET SWAN.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.697
THIS IS THE LOVE
OF HIS LIFE.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.865
YOU THINK I WANTED
TO KILL IT?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.133
I DIDN'T WANT
TO KILL A SWAN!

12:13.233 --> 12:15.435
WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CALL ANIMAL CONTROL

12:15.535 --> 12:17.304
- OR THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.807
THERE COULD BE SOMETHING
IN THE FOOD OR WATER--
THEY'RE ATTACKING!

12:19.907 --> 12:21.574
NOBODY'S CALLING ANYBODY.
YOU GOT THAT?

12:21.674 --> 12:24.177
NOBODY'S CALLING ANYBODY.
WE'LL GET KICKED
OUT OF THE CLUB.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.946
OKAY.
WELL, I GOTTA
TELL MY WIFE.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.848
HEY!
NO WIVES. NOBODY.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.382
COME ON, I TELL
MY WIFE EVERYTHING.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.085
IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT WE AGREED TO
IN OUR MARRIAGE VOWS.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.054
YOU TELL YOUR
WIFE EVERYTHING?!

12:34.154 --> 12:35.889
SHE WON'T TELL ANYBODY,
BUT I GOT TO TELL HER.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.424
- I HAVE TO TELL HER.
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!

12:37.524 --> 12:38.859
- WHAT?
- YOU DON'T TELL
YOUR WIFE ANYTHING!

12:38.959 --> 12:40.727
MY WIFE THINKS
I'M AT THE OFFICE.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.831
THE ONLY TIME I TELL HER
I'M PLAYING GOLF IS WHEN
I'M WITH ANOTHER WOMAN!

12:43.931 --> 12:45.565
YOU GOT TO COVER
YOUR TRACKS.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.668
WE'RE A FOURSOME HERE.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
NO WIVES!

12:48.768 --> 12:50.637
ALL RIGHT.
FINE.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.172
WE GOT TO BURY
THIS THING NOW.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.174
YEAH, LET'S BURY IT.
WE'LL BURY IT IN THE WOODS.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.476
- Andy: SERIOUSLY?!
- YEAH. COME ON,
PICK IT UP.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.812
- NO, YOU PICK IT UP.
YOU KILLED IT.
- YOU PICK IT UP.

12:58.912 --> 13:02.049
OH, THIS IS HORRIBLE.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.418
OH, IT'S HORRIBLE.
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.640
- FRUIT'S GOOD.
- YEAH.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.311
- DELICIOUS, ISN'T IT?
- HOW CAN YOU TALK
ABOUT THE FOOD?

13:31.411 --> 13:35.182
I WANT TO THROW UP.
WE SHOULD GET
OUT OF HERE.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.985
- YES, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
- OH, THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.219
I WANT TO GET
OUT OF HERE NOW.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.254
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO YOU, MORON.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.224
SWAN KILLERS LEAVE.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.327
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
SWAN KILLERS STAY,

13:47.427 --> 13:50.063
HAVE A LITTLE LUNCH,
ENJOY THEMSELVES,

13:50.163 --> 13:52.665
SOCIALIZE,
GET TO KNOW THE MEMBERS.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.634
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG.
GET IT?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.603
GUESS WHAT?

13:56.703 --> 13:58.906
I'M NOT A SWAN KILLER.
OKAY?

13:59.006 --> 14:02.742
HEY, LET ME REMIND YOU
OF SOMETHING, ASSHOLE:

14:02.842 --> 14:06.346
YOU'RE TALKING WAY TOO LOUD
ABOUT SWAN KILLING

14:06.446 --> 14:07.680
IN THE DINING ROOM.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.716
WHY IS THAT SO HARD
TO UNDERSTAND?

14:09.816 --> 14:11.584
HOW MANY RULES ARE YOU
GONNA BREAK, OKAY?

14:11.684 --> 14:15.188
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE YOUR PHONE ON.
IT'S ALWAYS RINGING.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.324
- YOU KILLED A SWAN!
- KEEP YOUR FUCKING
VOICE DOWN!

14:17.424 --> 14:19.859
- YOU KILLED A SWAN.
- SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

14:25.365 --> 14:28.501
( speaks Spanish )

14:33.907 --> 14:37.877
( yells in Spanish )

14:42.615 --> 14:44.217
WHY DID I
ORDER TURKEY?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.519
I SHOULD'VE JUST HAD
THE EGGS AND ONIONS.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.155
I KNOW
THEY'RE GOOD HERE.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.523
WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND SHUT UP ABOUT
YOUR FOOD?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.192
HE'S RIGHT. ALL YOU'RE
DOING IS COMPLAINING
ABOUT YOUR FOOD.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.227
I TOLD YOU TO GET THE FRUIT.
IT'S DELICIOUS.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.063
I HAD FRUIT THIS MORNING.
WHAT AM I GONNA ORDER
IT TWICE FOR?

14:56.163 --> 14:57.697
- YOU CAN HAVE FRUIT
TWICE IN ONE DAY.
- YOU CAN'T.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.566
YOU GET THE ACID.
IT'LL RIP A HOLE
IN YOUR STOMACH.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.102
THEY HAVE NON-ACIDIC FRUIT.
YOU GOT PAPAYA AND MANGO
AND BANANA.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.372
HEY, UH,
WHAT'S THAT?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.955
- WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
- I DON'T KNOW,

15:22.055 --> 15:23.790
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.626
WE JUST BURIED THE THING
20 MINUTES AGO. THEY'RE
NOT GONNA FIND IT ALREADY.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.462
OH NO.
LOOK.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.980
( barks order )

15:47.080 --> 15:49.416
CLUBHOUSE!

15:57.557 --> 15:59.326
NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.261
IT WAS A BIRD.
WHAT WERE YOU
SO SCARED OF?

16:01.361 --> 16:03.496
- A BIRD!
- IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE!

16:03.596 --> 16:05.298
WHAT COULD IT HAVE
POSSIBLY DONE TO YOU?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.434
- IT COULD'VE KILLED ME.
- IT'S NOT A WILD BOAR!

16:07.534 --> 16:09.569
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
WHEN IT LEAPED IN THE AIR!

16:09.669 --> 16:12.172
( all clamoring )

16:12.272 --> 16:15.442
WHY EVEN BURY IT?
WHY WERE YOU THINKING
OF BURYING IT?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.577
- ( clamoring stops )
- MR. TAKAHASHI

16:17.677 --> 16:20.047
WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU ALL
IN HIS OFFICE NOW.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.491
SO, GENTLEMEN.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.595
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.997
THIS IS TEE SHEET.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.733
IT TELLS ME WHO PLAYED

16:40.833 --> 16:42.001
AND WHO DID NOT PLAY.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.870
ONLY ONE OTHER
GROUP PLAYED.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.839
COURSE NOT CROWDED.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.076
RESPECT FOR NORM.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.712
OH. YOU PLAYED.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.114
WHY?
YOU NO RESPECT NORM?

16:54.214 --> 16:57.117
- NO NO, OF COURSE.
- ABSOLUTELY.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.419
ALTHOUGH HE WAS
A SLOW PLAYER.

17:00.653 --> 17:04.257
WHAT ELSE YOU NOT RESPECT?

17:06.259 --> 17:07.860
BEAUTIFUL BLACK SWAN?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.397
( all clamoring )

17:10.497 --> 17:12.199
WE ADORE SWANS!

17:12.299 --> 17:14.901
MY BEAUTIFUL
BLACK SWAN KYOKO

17:15.001 --> 17:17.070
WAS KILLED, MURDERED.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.673
WHO KILLED KYOKO?

17:20.773 --> 17:22.842
YOU.
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.344
- WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M A GUEST HERE.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.247
IF I MAY SAY,
I THINK THE FOOD HERE
IS JUST GREAT.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.782
- I ORDERED SOME EGGS WITH--
- YOU KILL SWAN?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.918
NO, SIR.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.121
I'M FROM OUT OF TOWN.
I HAVE NO REASON
TO KILL THE SWAN.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.657
YOU.
YOU SMART GUY.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.192
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.027
- YOU NOT KILL SWAN.
- OH, NO, SIR.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.062
BUT YOU KNOW
WHO KILL SWAN.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.932
WELL, I DON'T THINK--
NO, I DON'T THINK I DO.

17:46.032 --> 17:49.802
- YOU LIKE CLUB?
- I LOVE THIS CLUB.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.840
YOU TELL ME,
FREE DUES.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.808
NO MORE DUES.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.411

18:01.080 --> 18:04.517

18:04.617 --> 18:07.654

18:07.754 --> 18:10.557
IF YOU TELL ME.
TELL ME.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.165
UM, NO I REALLY CAN'T THINK
OF WHO COULD'VE DONE IT.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.969
- YOU.
- HMM.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.104
- YOU KILL SWAN?
- NO, I'D NEVER
KILL A SWAN.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.073
- WHY? YOU STUPID.
- I'M NOT STUPID.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.875
YES.
YOU MARRY BIG-MOUTH WIFE.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.943
SHE DOES HAVE
A BIG MOUTH.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.045
YES, MAYBE I TALK
TO HER.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.947
NO, DON'T CALL HER.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.717
I DON'T EVEN BRING
HER AROUND ANYMORE
OUT OF RESPECT.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.020
OH.
LARRY.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.691
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M GOOD.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.559
YEAH?

18:50.830 --> 18:53.933
- YOU KILL KYOKO?
- NO.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.502
- YEAH.
- NO.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.480
( cell phone ringing )

19:14.254 --> 19:17.156
I CAN'T TALK NOW.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.759
NO CELL PHONE
IN THE CLUBHOUSE!

19:19.859 --> 19:20.927
LAST WARNING!

19:21.027 --> 19:23.863
NOW GO!
GO!

19:26.533 --> 19:31.904
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?
- OH, THEY'RE HAVING A MEMORIAL
FOR NORM AT THE CLUB.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.740
- AND TOMORROW A FUNERAL.
- OH MY GOD.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.243
TWO DAYS IN A ROW.
THIS IS WORSE THAN
PLAYING BEHIND HIM.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.110
ANYWAY, I CAME IN
TO THANK YOU

19:38.211 --> 19:41.348
FOR YOUR GRACIOUS OFFER
FOR PUTTING SKYLAR
THROUGH COLLEGE.

19:41.448 --> 19:45.017
- WELL, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE WELCOME.
- THANK YOU.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.920
I MEAN, MY WIFE AND I
WERE TALKING ABOUT IT
IN BED LAST NIGHT.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.456
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
CASSIE SAID TO ME?

19:49.556 --> 19:52.292
SHE WANTS TO GO
TO COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.861
SO WOULD YOU
PUT HER THROUGH
COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.230
( scoffs )

19:57.330 --> 20:00.199
- WHAT?
- THIS IS HER CALLING.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.034
WOULD I PUT HER THROUGH
COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL?

20:02.134 --> 20:03.503
SHE'S GREAT
WITH LOTIONS!

20:03.603 --> 20:05.505
I MEAN,
HAVE YOU EVER--
WHAT SHE DOES--

20:05.605 --> 20:08.308
OH MY GOD,
SHE WAS BORN
TO DO THIS.

20:08.408 --> 20:12.312
I HAVE TO SAY
I'M VERY PUT OFF BY THIS.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.146
- WHY?
- I MAKE THIS
GENEROUS OFFER

20:14.247 --> 20:16.115
TO PAY FOR YOUR
DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION

20:16.215 --> 20:19.452
AND NOW YOU WANT ME
TO PUT YOUR WIFE THROUGH
COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL?!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.120
- YEAH.
- ALL OF A SUDDEN?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.189
NO, I JUST THINK
IT'S WRONG.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.458
IT'S VERY WRONG OF YOU
TO ASK ME THAT.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.295
- DON'T YOU GET THAT?
- HOW IRRATIONAL A MAN
CAN YOU BE?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.996
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
YOU'RE SAYING NO?

20:30.096 --> 20:31.731
- ( stammers )
- YES, I'M SAYING NO.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.133
I JUST THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE A GESTURE.
IT WOULD BE NICE.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.936
- SHE'D BE PERFECT FOR IT.
- I THOUGHT I MADE
MY NICE GESTURE

20:37.036 --> 20:39.406
- WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
SKYLAR'S GONNA GO TO COLLEGE.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.274
I'M NOT SAYING IT WASN'T
A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE,

20:41.374 --> 20:43.075
BUT WHO KNOWS?
SHE MIGHT BE A DRUG ADDICT.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.812
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.481
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE--
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF
PEOPLE WE'RE NOT?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.617
WE'RE NOT THE KIND OF
PEOPLE THAT KILL SWANS.

20:50.717 --> 20:54.687
THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE.
WE DON'T KILL SWANS.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.126
WE WERE IN BED AND WE WERE--
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT--

21:00.226 --> 21:01.794
I HAD TO TELL HER, LARRY.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.631
DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.700
THE TWO OF YOU
HAD BETTER KEEP

21:07.800 --> 21:10.102
YOUR GODDAMN TRAPS SHUT
ABOUT THIS SWAN.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.472
- OR WHAT, LARRY?
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?
- YEAH.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.774
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ME?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.344
- WHAT CAN YOU DO TO ME?
- I'LL OPEN THAT CLOSET DOOR

21:17.444 --> 21:20.347
AND TAKE EVERY ONE
OF THOSE HATS

21:20.447 --> 21:22.048
AND DESTROY 'EM.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.816
THE BLUE HAT,
THE ORANGE HAT,

21:23.916 --> 21:26.453
THE ONE WITH
THE COCKLE SHELLS,
THE ONE WITH THE FEATHERS,

21:26.553 --> 21:29.889
AND LET'S NOT FORGET
THE RED ONE YOU'RE MAKING
FOR THAT ASSHOLE STONEMASON.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.425
YOU STOP!
YOU WILL NOT
TOUCH THOSE HATS!

21:32.525 --> 21:36.128
- I WILL DESTROY THEM.
- YOU WILL NOT TOUCH MY HATS!

21:36.228 --> 21:37.497
KEEP YOUR
GODDAMN MOUTH SHUT!

21:37.597 --> 21:40.232
SHE WILL!
YOU'RE NOT GONNA RUIN A HAT.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.402
AND YOU!
HOW DARE YOU SAY SOMETHING?!

21:42.502 --> 21:44.837
LARRY, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL ANYBODY.
DON'T WORRY.

21:50.042 --> 21:53.613
- HEY.
- HEY, L.D.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.515
I WAS JUST SAYING
I FEEL SO NOSTALGIC.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.850
- I'M THINKING ABOUT
MY MOM AND DAD.
- REALLY?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.919
- WELL.
- HOW'S YOUR DAD?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.721
HE'S GOOD.
HE'S GOOD.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.056
YEAH, I'M CHANGING
THE HEADSTONE.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.892
GREAT. GREAT.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.428
BY THE WAY, I WAS
TALKING TO THE STONEMASON
ON THE PHONE THE OTHER NIGHT?

22:08.528 --> 22:10.963
WHAT AN ASSHOLE THIS GUY IS.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.433
HE BUTTS IN ON A CONVERSATION
THAT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS,

22:13.533 --> 22:15.935
STARTS TELLING ME
HOW JETER'S OVERRATED.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.804
WHAT AN IGNORANT MORON.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.205
- OKAY.
- MY GOD.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.608
PLEASE, GIVE ME A BREAK.
THERE'S NOT ONE PERSON

22:21.708 --> 22:23.710
WHO'S EVER SAID THAT
EXCEPT THIS ASSHOLE.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.012
- HONESTLY.
- I'M AN ASSHOLE?

22:26.112 --> 22:28.147
WHO ARE YOU?

22:28.247 --> 22:30.617
I'M ED--
THE STONEMASON.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.685
AH.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.424
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:37.524 --> 22:41.093
DID MARTY'S MOM'S HEADSTONE
AND HIS DAD'S HEADSTONE.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.795
I'M DOING NORM'S HEADSTONE.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.432
I HOPE I GET TO DO
YOURS REAL SOON, PRICK.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.637
SEE YOU LATER, EDDIE.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.171
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
HE WAS THE STONEMASON?

22:52.271 --> 22:54.140
OH, YOU WANTED
AN INTRODUCTION.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.508
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- YEAH.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.277
WHAT ABOUT YOUR POLICY?
NO INTRODUCTIONS.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.413
I KNOW, BUT THERE'S
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.149
NO NO, YOU SAID
THEY WERE A STUPID
SOCIAL CONVENTION.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.151
SO I'M HOISTED
ON MY OWN PETARD.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.019
EXACTLY.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.755
HMM.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.222
WHERE'S JEFF?

23:10.322 --> 23:11.624
OH, HE SAID HE WAS
GONNA BE LATE.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.494
LOOK, HE SENT ME
THIS EMAIL.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.996
LOOK AT THIS.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.599
HE WANTS ME TO COME CLEAN
ABOUT THE SWAN.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.134
- I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
- NO, IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.570
Man:
EVERYONE, IF I COULD
HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.137
IF YOU'LL PLEASE TAKE
YOUR SEATS,

23:25.237 --> 23:26.839
WE'RE ABOUT
TO GET STARTED.

23:26.939 --> 23:31.043
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.
AS YOU KNOW, THE FUNERAL
IS TOMORROW,

23:31.143 --> 23:33.580
BUT WE WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY,

23:33.680 --> 23:36.148
AND THAT'S CELEBRATE
NORM'S LIFE

23:36.248 --> 23:38.417
IN A SPECIAL
MEMORIAL SERVICE.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.420
AND WHERE ELSE?
THE PLACE HE LOVED THE MOST--

23:41.521 --> 23:43.389
HIS BELOVED CLUB.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.658
NORM LOVED NOTHING MORE
THAN COMING HERE

23:45.758 --> 23:47.927
AND ENJOYING
A LEISURELY GAME OF GOLF.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.196
( cell phone ringing )

24:00.106 --> 24:02.542
( ringing stops )

24:08.180 --> 24:11.450
PLEASE TURN OFF
YOUR CELL PHONES AND PAGERS.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.952
THANK YOU.

24:17.389 --> 24:21.027
- SORRY.
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

24:21.127 --> 24:24.697
- WHAT WHAT WHAT?
- YOU KILLED HIM, LARRY.

24:24.797 --> 24:30.036
OH, NO.
IN FACT, I HAVE A THEORY
I'D LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.804
MAY I TELL YOU MY THEORY?

24:31.904 --> 24:35.007
OKAY. I BELIEVE
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED:

24:35.107 --> 24:39.145
NORM HAD THE HEART ATTACK
ON THE 12TH HOLE

24:39.245 --> 24:40.680
NEAR THE POND,
AM I RIGHT?

24:40.780 --> 24:42.048
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

24:42.148 --> 24:47.754
I THINK HE WAS ATTACKED
BY THE BLACK SWAN.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.256
THE SWAN IS DEAD, LARRY.

24:50.356 --> 24:53.392
HE'S DEAD NOW.
HE WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE

24:53.492 --> 24:55.094
AT THE TIME NORM
HAD THE HEART ATTACK

24:55.194 --> 24:56.863
AND AT THAT POND
WITH NORM.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.865
HERE, THE TWO
OF THEM OVER HERE.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.534
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE
LOCKER ROOM.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.870
I'M HERE.
I'M OVER HERE.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.105
HERE'S NORM
AND THE SWAN.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.274
HERE'S NORM.
KYOKO THE CRAZY BLACK SWAN.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.977
NORM.
HEART ATTACK. DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.244
THAT'S WHY NORM DIED.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.046
THAT BLACK SWAN
WAS A MENACE.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.514
THEY SHOULD'VE PUT THAT SWAN
AWAY A LONG TIME AGO.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.184
I DON'T KNOW WHO KILLED
THAT BLACK SWAN,

25:18.284 --> 25:20.252
BUT WHOEVER DID IT

25:20.352 --> 25:21.988
WAS A HERO.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.756
A HERO.

25:28.060 --> 25:32.164
AH, MR. DAVID,
I BELIEVE THIS IS YOURS.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.368
YEAH.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.305
THAT'S SOME
BLACKBERRY YOU GOT HERE.
THIS WHEEL IS AMAZING.

25:39.405 --> 25:42.241
YOU CAN REALLY
JUST SCROLL RIGHT
THROUGH THOSE EMAILS, HUH?

25:42.341 --> 25:45.578
YEAH.

25:47.179 --> 25:50.316
- THANKS.
- IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE
SERVING YOU, SIR.

25:52.585 --> 25:55.021
THERE'S NO DOUBT
THAT HE READ YOUR EMAIL
ABOUT THE SWAN KILLING.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.089
HE'S GONNA TELL TAKAHASHI.
WE'RE SCREWED.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.991
WE'RE ALL SCREWED,
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

26:01.193 --> 26:05.932
THERE'S, UH-- THERE'S
AN 18% GRATUITY INCLUDED.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.336
SO...

26:12.071 --> 26:13.806
- THAT'S A SHAKEDOWN.
- THAT'S A SHAKEDOWN.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.808
THIS IS AS CLEAR
AS CAN BE.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.277
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THIS.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.423
ALL RIGHT.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.661
- ALL SET?
- MM-HMM.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.696
GREAT.
WE'LL SEE YOU.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.532
IS THIS, UH--

26:40.633 --> 26:42.368
IS THIS FOR REAL?

26:42.468 --> 26:44.536
OH YEAH.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.572
YEAH, THAT'S FOR REAL.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.574
MR. DAVID,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.711
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- THIS IS SO GENEROUS.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.681
AND LET'S--
LET'S KEEP THIS
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.084
- NO PROBLEM.
- YOU KNOW, LIKE
EVERYTHING ELSE.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.719
YEAH.
YEAH, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.889
YOU KNOW, LIKE EVERYTHING--
EVERYTHING ELSE.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.825
THANK YOU AGAIN.
REALLY.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.427
WHAT A GENEROUS GUY.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.363
I DON'T THINK HE KNEW
WHAT THE FUCK YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT.

27:14.266 --> 27:18.370
HE HAD THE HEART ATTACK
RIGHT BY THE POND.
IT WAS THE SWAN.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.572
THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S A THEORY.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.843
ANYWAY, IT WAS
A LOVELY SERVICE.
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE CLUB.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.678
LARRY, I'D LIKE
TALK TO YOU.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.047
YES, MR. TAKAHASHI?

27:28.147 --> 27:30.983
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR BIG
ADDITIONAL TIP TO WAITER.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.952
SUCH GENEROSITY.

27:33.052 --> 27:37.056
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE
DON'T GIVE ADDITIONAL TIP.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.892
NOW I KNOW A MAN
SO GENEROUS

27:39.992 --> 27:43.462
COULD NOT HAVE KILLED
MY BLACK SWAN, MY KYOKO.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.431
OF COURSE
I DIDN'T KILL KYOKO.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.733
I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.200
YOU FORGIVE ME?

27:48.300 --> 27:50.136
OKAY.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.704
( laughs )

27:51.804 --> 27:53.005
- I'LL FORGIVE YOU.
- THANK YOU.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.107
LOST A LITTLE FACE,
DIDN'T YOU?

27:55.207 --> 27:56.575
A LITTLE-- OH, A LOT.
I LOST A LOT OF FACE.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.711
- GOT YOUR FACE BACK?
- YES YES YES.

27:58.811 --> 28:03.149
- OH, YOU GOING TO CAR?
- ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO SEE
MY MOTHER'S GRAVESTONE,

28:03.249 --> 28:06.018
BUT IT'S ON THE WAY
TO THE PARKING LOT.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.487
- WE WALK TOGETHER.
- LET US WALK TOGETHER.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.456
AFTER YOU, SIR.
AFTER YOU.

28:10.556 --> 28:13.192
I HAVE A COUPLE THINGS
I WANTED TO DISCUSS
WITH YOU ACTUALLY.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.862
LET'S GET RID
OF THAT ADDITIONAL TIP
IN THE DINING ROOM.

28:15.962 --> 28:18.064
NOBODY WANTS TO
SIT AND DO MATH AFTER
THEY EAT TO FIGURE OUT

28:18.164 --> 28:19.799
- AND ADDITIONAL TIP.
- NO MATH.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.869
MAKE IT A 20% FLAT--
MAKE IT 25%.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.871
- YES, 25%.
- 25%.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.505
- HUH? YOU LIKE THAT?
- I LOVE IT.

28:26.605 --> 28:29.641
- OKAY, MR. TAKAHASHI.
- I LIKE THAT.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.778
VERY MUCH!

28:31.878 --> 28:33.880
LAST TIME YOU LEAVE
A BIG TIP

28:33.980 --> 28:35.782
IT ALWAYS
GO TO THE WAITER.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.683
THEY LIKE YOU
SO MUCH.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.518
- ALL RIGHT, YOU TAKE CARE.
- BYE BYE!

28:39.618 --> 28:40.787
OKAY.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.459
( theme music playing )
