WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.104
Yeah! Touchdown!
Yes! Jets, baby!

00:03.171 --> 00:04.738
Are we
celebrating something?

00:04.805 --> 00:06.940
Yes.
Jets up by 14.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.209
Look alive, Chale.

00:08.276 --> 00:11.312
**

00:11.379 --> 00:13.047
( Thinking )
Why did I come in here?

00:14.448 --> 00:15.916
( Thinking )
Why did I throw that?

00:15.983 --> 00:17.718
( Thinking ) He really
shouldn't have thrown that.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.387
( Thinking )
Move your hands up, dude.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.455
Why won't my hands move?

00:21.522 --> 00:22.823
Maybe he'll surprise me.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.993
Even seals catch balls,
and they don't have arms.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.961
Ooh, do I have an ice pack
in the fridge?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.664
No pressure.
No pressure.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.833
This will tell me everything
I need to know about you.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.636
Don't close your eyes.
Don't close your eyes!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.638
Come on, Chale.
One time.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.773
I got it!

00:39.840 --> 00:41.575
Way to go, Chale!

00:41.642 --> 00:43.244
I love you so much!

00:43.311 --> 00:45.313
Wow! He caught it.

00:46.814 --> 00:47.915
Ohh!
Ohh!

00:47.981 --> 00:48.982
I'll get the ice pack.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.586
That's a purple face tomorrow.

00:52.653 --> 00:57.125
* I am not your ordinary guy

00:58.692 --> 01:00.328
( Sighs ) Hey.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.895
Hey, babe.
How was work?

01:01.962 --> 01:04.132
Ugh. Horrible.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.399
I'm sorry.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.401
Listen. You know how our grill
is on its way out?

01:07.468 --> 01:08.602
I've been looking online.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.638
They have these, like,
smoker/grill combos.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.207
They're pricy, but, man,
what a game changer.

01:13.274 --> 01:17.445
Uh, honey, I just told you
my day was horrible.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.114
Yeah.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.882
I just told you
we could be making pulled pork

01:21.949 --> 01:24.185
in our own backyard.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.519
All right.
What happened?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.988
Okay, well, first of all,
I wake up this morning

01:28.055 --> 01:30.090
and one of my wisdom teeth
is just throbbing.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.759
I mean,
it's got to come out,

01:31.825 --> 01:34.195
but Dr. Schneider can't even
see me until Thursday.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.296
Ohh.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.298
And then I get an e-mail
from my principal,

01:37.365 --> 01:39.066
and you know how
I want to move up

01:39.133 --> 01:41.135
from nursing at the middle
school to the high school?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.903
No, but go on.

01:45.038 --> 01:48.542
Well, I have seniority,
but Gwen in my office,

01:48.609 --> 01:50.311
you know, the one who
found out she's 1/10 French,

01:50.378 --> 01:51.779
and all of a sudden,
she's got an accent

01:51.845 --> 01:53.947
and she's double-kissing
people.

01:54.014 --> 01:57.084
She went behind my back
to try to get the job.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.152
That's ridiculous.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.188
I know!

02:00.254 --> 02:01.455
This one's over
1,000 bucks,

02:01.522 --> 02:03.157
and it doesn't even have
a rotisserie.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.694
Honey...

02:06.760 --> 02:09.797
I'm trying to tell you
how horrible my day was,

02:09.863 --> 02:11.131
and you are looking
at grills

02:11.199 --> 02:12.633
that we absolutely cannot
afford?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.203
I get it. We can pay to have
your teeth taken out,

02:15.269 --> 02:20.908
but the minute I want to
smoke some meat, we're broke.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.043
Hey, you're going to work?
I thought you had class.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.578
Yeah, well, we're short
a bartender,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.347
and Enzo needs me
to pick up extra shifts,

02:26.414 --> 02:28.316
but my friend is taking notes,
so it's all good,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.150
but I got to go,
so I love you, guys, okay?

02:30.218 --> 02:31.585
Love you.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.290
Did you hear
what Kendra just said?

02:36.357 --> 02:40.694
I think we established
listening isn't
my strong suit.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.563
She's missing class.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.032
Okay, Enzo's was supposed to
be a part-time job

02:45.098 --> 02:47.535
so that she could earn
a little extra spending money.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.370
We got to talk to her.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.471
All right.
We will tonight.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.972
No. It's more important
than that.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.842
You know what?
Can you please go
down there right now?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.710
I would, but my jaw,
it just --

02:56.777 --> 02:59.580
it hurts every time
I move my mouth.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.949
Don't you think that's
a little message from God

03:02.015 --> 03:03.717
telling you to...

03:06.053 --> 03:07.655
telling you to...

03:12.660 --> 03:15.095
Listen, sweetheart, I
got to talk to you about
something very important.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.497
Okay.
Dad, for the last time,

03:16.564 --> 03:18.866
I do not have the power
to name a sandwich after you.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.470
All I'm asking is that
you drop a note
in the suggestion box.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.572
Okay, Dad,
I got to get these pies out.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.307
I'm not -- I wanted to
talk to you about
something else anyway.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.508
I got to go!

03:27.575 --> 03:28.776
( Telephone rings )

03:28.842 --> 03:31.512
Oh, wait. Guy! My beer.
Seriously?

03:31.579 --> 03:33.714
It's right there.
Kevin, just hand that to him,
please.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.015
Ah.
Thanks.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.484
Yeah, Enzo's.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.319
Oh, yeah.
I'm checking on it now.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.721
Sorry. I didn't mean
to snap like that.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.190
I'm just having
one of those days, you know?

03:43.257 --> 03:44.958
I hear ya.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.327
Big promotion at work,

03:46.394 --> 03:48.896
this buddy of mine's trying
to steal it from under me,

03:48.962 --> 03:50.664
and he doesn't have
any talent.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.500
He's just got a big mouth.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.769
Look,
I don't know your situation,

03:55.836 --> 03:58.306
but, uh, I'm sure
your boss will figure it out.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.309
Just remember this --
Smart is always quiet.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.243
Idiots are always loud.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.245
Hey! We need more ice!

04:05.313 --> 04:06.647
See there?

04:06.714 --> 04:07.981
Yeah, thanks.
All right.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.783
I needed that.
There you go, buddy.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.786
Oh, uh, I-I-I-I
can't make change.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.556
Keep it. It's yours.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.592
Excuse me.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.028
What do recommend -- the
meatball hero or the calzone?

04:21.094 --> 04:25.633
I recommend you lose the "or"
and slap an "and" on that.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.800
Man: You know what?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.101
We'll take two of each
to go,

04:28.168 --> 04:29.970
and we'll have two beers
while we wait.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.138
I like it.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.173
Enzo, these guys want
a couple of beers.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.113
**

04:40.180 --> 04:42.350
Hey, there he is.
So, how'd it go?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.017
Unbelievable.
Really?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.620
Yeah. I got the job.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.357
Wh-- What? W-What job?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.325
Bartender. Enzo's.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.727
He needed someone,
and I was there.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.029
What's up? What's up?

04:58.866 --> 05:01.068
Okay. Hold up.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.803
Okay, so,
I sent you down there

05:02.870 --> 05:04.538
to make sure Kendra
wasn't working too much,

05:04.605 --> 05:06.574
and now
you work there, too?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.342
I'll make money
for my smoker, right?

05:08.409 --> 05:11.111
I'll check up on her.
It's like eyes on the inside.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.581
I guess...so.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.049
And get this,
my employee number -- 007.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.818
No one took it.
How awesome is that?

05:17.885 --> 05:19.019
Nobody.
Yeah.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.522
No, babe.
I-I'll update our Facebook.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.056
Already did.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.229
I don't know.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.098
I'm just starting
to worry that Jeff
has commitment issues.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.600
Well, let's see.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.536
He's got two cellphones, he
comes home covered in glitter,

05:35.603 --> 05:37.938
and we both know it ain't from
working in the craft store.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.374
Well, what do I do?

05:40.441 --> 05:43.444
Ding, ding. I think you got to
call the bellhop.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.678
Bellhop?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.514
'Cause you ain't
just got a boyfriend,

05:46.580 --> 05:49.316
you got extra baggage.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.918
You know what?
I think you're right.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.152
Yeah.

05:52.219 --> 05:55.723
Ugh. Give me the
stiffest drink you got.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.925
All right.
Straight whiskey?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.660
Yeah.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.629
You know what?
Throw some Coke in there, too.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.763
Okay.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.031
And a lot of ice.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.067
Hey, you know what?
Just give me a Sprite.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.202
Somebody had a tough day,
huh?

06:09.269 --> 06:11.171
Yeah, well, you know,
I've been trying to get

06:11.238 --> 06:12.773
that fire-safety gig
at Citi Field.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.209
I e-mailed my resume,
but I got the standard
automated reply,

06:16.276 --> 06:17.911
so I guess that's done.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.548
What if I told you
I knew the guy
who could get you that job?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.282
Really? Who?

06:22.349 --> 06:24.217
You.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.554
That's weird, because
I mentioned me in the e-mail

06:26.620 --> 06:29.089
and they still said no.

06:29.156 --> 06:33.293
Kyle, you need to look
at failure as the sprinkles

06:33.360 --> 06:37.765
that make the cupcakes of life
so sweet.

06:37.831 --> 06:42.235
You know, you're saying that
so slow like it's important,

06:42.302 --> 06:44.972
but I'm still not
understanding.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.375
You go down there and you put
a face with the name.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.078
Oh.
Well, why didn't you say that?

06:51.144 --> 06:54.347
What's this thing with all
the sprinkles and cupcakes?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.949
I have my process.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.453
( Sighs ) Hey, babe.
Hi.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.023
Sorry I'm so late.
Enzo's was crazy tonight.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.424
Well, you missed dinner.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.593
Oh, yeah?
What'd you make?

07:05.659 --> 07:06.994
Vegetable stir-fry.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.162
Hmm. Sorry. Checked out
when I heard "vegetable."

07:11.765 --> 07:14.535
Very funny.
Hey, how is Kendra doing?

07:14.602 --> 07:17.437
Well, she doesn't
tip me out as well as
the other waitresses,

07:17.505 --> 07:21.775
but...I'm gonna bring it up to
her at the next staff meeting.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.143
( Cellphone rings )

07:25.378 --> 07:27.447
Yo, Timbo, you got Kev.
What's up?

07:27.515 --> 07:30.317
Uh, hey, babe, who is calling
you after 11:00 at night?

07:30.383 --> 07:32.252
Uh, hold on a second, Tim.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.487
He's one of my regulars,
all right?

07:33.554 --> 07:35.556
He's up for a promotion,
and one of his friends

07:35.623 --> 07:36.757
is trying to
steal it from him.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.058
Oh.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.960
You do realize
that's the exact same problem

07:40.027 --> 07:41.428
I told you
I was having at work?

07:41.495 --> 07:43.463
No. But if it is,
I'd listen in,

07:43.531 --> 07:45.899
'cause I'm about to
drop some knowledge.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.801
Tim, here's what you tell
your boss...

07:49.770 --> 07:51.772
Well, I dumped my boyfriend,
like you said.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.206
All right.
And how's that make you feel?

07:53.273 --> 07:54.374
Great!

07:54.441 --> 07:56.577
But now all my friends
are saying I should

07:56.644 --> 07:59.479
get back with him because,
well, he can be really sweet.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.015
Ooh. So is a grizzly bear
when it's sleeping.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.417
Dump them, too.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.753
Hey, Tim!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.054
I did what you said.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.557
It worked like a charm.
I got the promotion.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.024
That's awesome.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.359
Only thing is,
they want to move me

08:12.425 --> 08:13.594
to a satellite office
in Jersey.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.596
You -- You want to be
in Jersey?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.931
Well, no. I'd rather be
at the office in the city,

08:17.998 --> 08:19.466
but, I mean,
that'll be okay, right?

08:19.533 --> 08:22.069
Wrong.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.538
I got you this far.
I'll get you the rest
of the way.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.473
You tell them it's a no-go
on Jersey.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.275
Really?
I mean, it is a promotion.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.178
Yeah. It's a promotion
for your job,

08:31.244 --> 08:34.648
but a demotion
for your heart.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.650
Wow.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.586
Yeah. I felt it, too.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.757
All right. Come on, guys.
Look alive.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.426
You stood us up, man.
Not cool.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.597
I had to work, but,
hey, I left you
a motivational voicemail.

08:49.663 --> 08:53.567
You only miss 100% of the
shots you don't take? What?

08:53.634 --> 08:58.872
Yeah. Your brother missed 100%
of the shots he did take.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.309
I'm a defensive specialist.
You knew that going in.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.011
Guys, guys, let's just --
let's get out of here.

09:04.077 --> 09:07.414
He's tearing us apart.
Come on.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.716
Hey, uh, Kyle, wait up.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.819
How's it going with the job
down at Citi Field?

09:11.885 --> 09:14.454
Well, I went down there,
and they told me

09:14.521 --> 09:18.058
I needed to fill out
a resume online,
so back where I started.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.292
And you're okay with that?

09:19.359 --> 09:21.094
What am I supposed to do?

09:21.161 --> 09:22.329
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.397
Tomorrow, the Operations
Manager at Citi Field

09:24.464 --> 09:27.434
walks into his office,
and who's sitting there?

09:27.500 --> 09:28.936
His secretary?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.905
No. You.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.374
Because you don't let security
or fences stop you.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.243
Those are just obstacles.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.511
One way or the other,
you get in that office,

09:38.578 --> 09:40.614
and you let them know
you are not leaving

09:40.681 --> 09:42.349
until you get
what you came for,

09:42.415 --> 09:43.817
'cause that's what
a go-getter does.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.720
See, normally,
that would be a list of things

09:46.787 --> 09:49.356
that would get me arrested.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.358
But the way you say it

09:51.424 --> 09:54.461
sounds like
I'm gonna get the job.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.466
Nice to meet you, Head of
Fire Safety at Citi Field.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.636
I just got chills.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.338
**

10:09.209 --> 10:11.779
Wow. That smoker's awesome.
I can't believe it.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.580
How did you know
to get the right one?

10:13.647 --> 10:14.782
Uh, well,
your screen saver

10:14.848 --> 10:16.650
used to be a picture of me
and the kids,

10:16.717 --> 10:20.187
and then I noticed it
changed to the Smoke Pro 4000.

10:20.253 --> 10:25.192
So...bit of a gut punch,
but message received.

10:25.258 --> 10:28.729
All right. This round is
bratwurst, sausage, and ribs.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.497
Oh, and, by the way,
the mystery spice

10:30.563 --> 10:32.132
from the last round
was habanero.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.836
That answer, again...
habanero.

10:35.903 --> 10:39.907
Mr. Gable, I'm afraid
I'm starting to get
the meat sweats.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.975
Sara: Yeah,
I can't eat anymore.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.176
Never thought
I'd say this,

10:43.243 --> 10:44.812
but can I please
go do my homework?

10:44.878 --> 10:45.946
Yeah.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.514
I need to lie down.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.916
Okay, well,
don't go sleep,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.650
or Mr. Gable might smoke
and eat you.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.054
You know what, hon? I got
to get to work anyway, so --

10:54.121 --> 10:55.723
What?
You're going to Enzo's?

10:55.789 --> 10:58.325
Honey, I thought
you were done.
You got the smoker.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.227
Babe, that's kind of why I got
you the smoker.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.195
But that's not what
it's about anymore.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.664
Look. I don't need to make
the money anymore, but it's --

11:04.732 --> 11:06.333
You know, it's --
I'm connecting
with these people.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.635
And I didn't realize this,
but I have a gift.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.570
Okay.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.106
Honey, you missed Sara's
lacrosse game,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.208
I feel like I've only seen you
for 10 minutes this week,

11:15.275 --> 11:17.044
and do even remember
that you have to pick me up

11:17.110 --> 11:18.912
at the dentist's tomorrow?
Yeah, of course, I do.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.181
You're getting hung up
on the three or four
balls I'm dropping.

11:21.248 --> 11:24.952
You got to focus
on the 100 I got in the air.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.421
Wow! That is awesome. I got to
remember that for Phyllis.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.090
So, ladies,
don't bog down

11:30.157 --> 11:32.826
on the three or four balls
you drop in life.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.363
Instead, focus on
the 100 you keep in the air

11:36.429 --> 11:39.733
and shine like diamonds
in the night.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.468
( Telephone rings )
Excuse me.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.938
Enzo's.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.741
( Muffled ) Where are you?
I need you to pick me up.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.743
Hey. This is a business,
all right, buddy?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.845
I'm a cop, and I know
how to trace a call.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.246
But it's me!

11:53.313 --> 11:54.314
It's me!

11:54.381 --> 11:56.583
Get help, freak!

12:00.353 --> 12:02.589
Look, I'm really sorry,
all right?

12:02.655 --> 12:05.458
It was crazy there! I didn't
even feel my phone buzzing.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.360
By the way, I got to say,
without the back teeth,

12:07.427 --> 12:09.729
your cheek bones
are popping.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.132
I ain't hating
the swollen lips, either.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.602
It's like,
"Is that Donna Gable,
or is that Gisele?"

12:15.668 --> 12:18.705
It's Donna Gable.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.473
And don't try to be
nice right now, okay?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.810
The job has to end.
I'm not joking.

12:22.876 --> 12:26.346
Com on. I messed up,
all right? But don't make
me quit. Please.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.681
Get another tooth pulled out
tomorrow. I'll pick you up.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.984
( Groans ) Do you hear
yourself right now?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.153
It's like you're addicted
to this job.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.522
I'm not addicted. I can
stop any time I wanted to.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.689
Stop now.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.792
I don't want to.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.227
You have to.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.328
Fine.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.797
But not yet.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.232
'Cause I don't want to.

12:45.298 --> 12:50.570
( Echoing )
'Cause I don't want to.

12:51.571 --> 12:52.772
Ah, there he is.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.908
The place is packed.
Everybody's waiting for you.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.745
( Sighs ) Actually, Enzo,
I got some bad news.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.580
I got to quit.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.716
( Chuckles ) No. Those people
need you. I need you.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.652
All right. One more time.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.554
( Sighs )

13:07.620 --> 13:10.057
Okay, Dad.
Teleprompter's ready to go.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.125
Here is your headset.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.862
I am so blessed to have
a father like you.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.030
All right.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.565
( Clears throat )

13:18.631 --> 13:22.735
**

13:22.802 --> 13:25.839
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome fill-in bartender

13:25.906 --> 13:27.607
and full-time life changer,

13:27.674 --> 13:32.445
the inspirational speaker
from Massapequa, Kevin Gable!

13:32.512 --> 13:35.983
( Cheers and applause )

13:36.049 --> 13:37.584
Wow!

13:37.650 --> 13:40.753
Wow!

13:40.820 --> 13:43.456
Wow. Thank you.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.624
Thank you!

13:44.691 --> 13:46.326
Thank you all!

13:46.393 --> 13:48.328
Thank you all!

13:48.395 --> 13:50.563
( Music stops )

13:50.630 --> 13:54.868
Just six days ago,
a man came to me.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.904
He was having trouble at work.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.172
Today, that man is
a millionaire.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.673
Tim, stand on up.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.975
Tim, get on up!

14:02.042 --> 14:06.579
( Cheers and applause )

14:06.646 --> 14:08.648
Now, that is what's possible

14:08.715 --> 14:11.351
when we all flip that switch
in our heads.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.953
We all have it.
You have it.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.487
You have it. You have it.
You have it.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.822
You, you, you, you, you.

14:15.889 --> 14:16.990
I'm not sure about you.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.859
( Laughs )
I'm kidding. He's got it.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.628
He's got it.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.697
Now, I've asked you all
to fill out your dream cards,

14:24.764 --> 14:28.135
and what I'm gonna do now is
show you how we get
those dreams

14:28.201 --> 14:29.869
from your head to the paper --

14:29.937 --> 14:30.971
To the universe.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.505
Oh! To the universe!
Do you hear that?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.175
That's Kendra. Give it up
for her. Let her know.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.743
All right. Now, follow me,

14:36.809 --> 14:39.646
because it's time to make
those dreams a reality.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.714
Let's go.

14:41.781 --> 14:45.986
The man you're about to meet
is a loser's loser.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.122
He lives in a garage
much like, say,

14:49.189 --> 14:52.025
a lawnmower
or an old pair of skis.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.826
Hello. I am Chale.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.164
Now, according to
his dream card,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.765
what's holding him back
is fear.

14:58.831 --> 15:03.236
Well, today, we'll make that
fear disappear.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.142
Step on the coals,
Chale.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.012
But they are on fire.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.180
Look at me.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.381
You can do it, son.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.918
I can do it.
( Laughs )

15:18.986 --> 15:19.987
( Sizzling )

15:20.053 --> 15:22.222
( Screams )

15:25.525 --> 15:27.160
( Espresso machine hisses )

15:29.362 --> 15:31.098
Hey, here is
your last check.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.932
Uh, I got
a little gravy on it,

15:33.000 --> 15:37.137
but you can still
make out the numbers.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.639
Hey, Dad, I'm sorry
this didn't work out.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.574
Are you kidding me?
It's my fault.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.376
I got distracted.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.445
Please don't that happen
to you, all right?

15:45.512 --> 15:46.913
Just focus on your studies,

15:46.980 --> 15:49.516
and if Mom asks,
I told you that two weeks ago.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.683
Okay.
All right.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.918
Love you.
All right. Love you.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.653
Okay.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.789
Kevin, you were right.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.359
I'm done looking out,
and I'm ready to look in.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.560
Can you talk?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.864
Actually, you know,
I don't -- I don't even
work here anymore.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.733
Um...

16:06.799 --> 16:10.503
but I guess I could
take a couple seconds
and we could talk.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.705
Yeah?
Yeah. All right.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.643
So, you think I should try
to reconnect

16:16.709 --> 16:18.678
with my biological father?

16:18.745 --> 16:21.681
Beth, some people run away
to hide.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.517
Some run away to be found.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.721
He moved to Bangkok.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.758
I'm gonna say he's a hider.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.593
( Cellphone rings )
Excuse me.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.927
Okay.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.996
Hello?
Hey, where are you?

16:37.064 --> 16:38.865
You were supposed to be home
an hour ago.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.933
I'm -- I'm at Enzo's,
but don't worry. I quit.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.569
The job was just
getting in the way

16:42.635 --> 16:44.637
of me connecting
with the people that need me.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.040
Oh,
you are out of control.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.542
Honey, relax.
I figured it out, all right?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.444
Look, I'm not a bartender.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.845
I'm a life coach.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.647
A life coach?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.983
And don't worry. I can see
clients at the house now.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.219
By the way, do we have room
in the backyard for hot coals?

17:00.820 --> 17:04.124
Ooh, Phyllis is here.
Oh, she's in tears.
I got to go. Okay.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.126
Phyllis, just grab a gin fizz.
I'll meet you at the booth.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.794
I want to hear everything.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.336
What's going on?

17:16.403 --> 17:19.339
First of all, everyone
in this room loves you.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.144
Okay.

17:24.211 --> 17:29.516
But, honey,
you have a problem,
and this in an intervention.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.524
Um, Kyle, would you like to
start us off?

17:37.590 --> 17:41.027
Absolutely.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.363
( Exhales deeply )

17:47.167 --> 17:51.438
Kevin, you're my brother,
and I love you.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.573
I followed your advice
and broke into the office

17:53.640 --> 17:57.444
of the Director of Operations
at Citi Field.

17:57.510 --> 18:01.614
I did not get the job.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.317
In fact, I was thrown out
of the building.

18:04.384 --> 18:08.355
Now, I am no longer allowed
to purchase tickets to games.

18:08.421 --> 18:13.293
They also have
my picture up at all
the entrances and exits.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.528
Not cool, bro. Get help.
I love you.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.397
( Clears throat )

18:17.464 --> 18:19.432
Guys.

18:19.499 --> 18:23.570
( Grunts ) Kevin, I don't even
know who you are anymore, man.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.673
You know, this new, helpful,
positive attitude you have,

18:26.739 --> 18:29.809
it just -- it makes me
want to punch you.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.113
If I get any more late night,
crazy-ass,

18:34.181 --> 18:36.115
Confucius messages
on my phone,

18:36.183 --> 18:37.917
I'm gonna have to
block your number.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.786
I have to admit,
I kind of like the messages.

18:39.852 --> 18:40.920
Thank you, Mott.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.255
Come on, Mott.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.090
It's the same stuff you get
from a fortune cookie.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.058
Not true. Each of those
are tailor-made

18:46.125 --> 18:47.360
specifically
for your needs.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.229
Dad, that's not true.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.897
You're pulling them
from the Internet

18:50.963 --> 18:52.665
and testing them on me
at work.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.834
She's a liar.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.403
Chale?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.538
I have to be honest.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.708
I just came in here
to watch TV.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.411
You guys just can't handle it,
but I help people.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.478
That's what I do.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.347
Well, we thought you might
say that.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.182
Tim? Liz?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.584
Oh, good.
I'm glad you guys are here.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.520
They can back me up.
Tim, tell them.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.123
You told me to tell my boss
it was my way or the highway.

19:17.190 --> 19:21.561
Now I'm living in
my PT Cruiser
just off the highway.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.364
And you told me to dump
my boyfriend and my friends.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.300
Now I'm alone in my apartment
with my cat.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.868
You know what I'm hearing?

19:28.935 --> 19:31.538
Someone who's lonely
and someone who needs
a place to stay.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.873
Peanut butter,
meet jelly.

19:35.107 --> 19:38.077
Sweetheart,
please accept this help.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.547
If you don't,
all of these people

19:40.613 --> 19:42.715
don't want to be
around you anymore.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.587
A frown when it's
turned upside down --

19:47.654 --> 19:49.522
No, no.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.927
In life, you're gonna find
a path less traveled
you should...

19:54.994 --> 19:56.263
Don't -- Don't do it.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.265
I'm gonna have
to return the smoker.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.603
Okay. I got a problem.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.740
( Voice breaking )
But I don't know what to do.

20:07.807 --> 20:11.711
**

20:16.316 --> 20:19.652
Wow, babe.
That's like the 50th one
in a row that you've caught.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.954
Yes.
I can catch a ball.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.390
( Chuckles )

20:23.456 --> 20:24.757
I just wanted
to prove to you

20:24.824 --> 20:26.759
that I'm not some
uncoordinated idiot.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.227
( Chuckles )

20:28.295 --> 20:31.598
You know, it might be my dad
who makes you nervous.

20:31.664 --> 20:35.402
It was a freak accident.
The light got in my eyes.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.705
( Scoffs ) Okay.
Baby, you know, it's okay.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.340
He can intimidate people.

20:40.407 --> 20:44.176
Darling, he does not
intimidate me.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.845
What's up, guys?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.179
Aah!
( Body thuds )

20:47.246 --> 20:50.016
Oh, no! Not again!

20:50.082 --> 20:51.851
Mom,
can you get the ice pack?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.921
And a little club soda.
We got a bleeder.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.626
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:59.692 --> 21:03.229
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

21:03.296 --> 21:05.432
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:05.498 --> 21:06.966
* Do, do, do, do

21:07.033 --> 21:10.570
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:10.637 --> 21:13.640
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:13.706 --> 21:16.275
* I just don't want no...
