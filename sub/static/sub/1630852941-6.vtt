00:21.810 --> 00:24.110
Are you investigating this case
as a serial murder?

00:24.550 --> 00:26.780
It's too early to confirm that.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.390
As you know,

00:28.890 --> 00:31.350
these murders took place
in different districts.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.990
It's been over a month
after the Suseong-dong incident.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.690
You still haven't made any progress?

00:35.690 --> 00:37.490
The detectives in those districts
and the Special Crime Squad...

00:37.490 --> 00:38.960
are doing their best.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.360
Are you sure this isn't a serial murder?

00:44.500 --> 00:45.970
Everyone, please.

00:45.970 --> 00:49.940
Don't jump to conclusions.
You'll only scare the public.

00:50.140 --> 00:52.470
I heard the MO for all three cases
was the same.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.070
And your answer is still a no?

00:54.070 --> 00:55.710
Just look at these murders.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.210
Are you sure there wasn't any accomplice?

00:58.310 --> 01:01.080
Is there a reason behind
not treating this as a serial murder?

01:01.080 --> 01:03.550
Since these incidents took place
in different districts,

01:03.550 --> 01:05.319
they couldn't have been a one-man job.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.690
Take this. You dropped this. Look.

01:52.470 --> 01:54.530
I'm sorry.
That was so not cool.

02:06.850 --> 02:08.050
What's going on?

02:14.520 --> 02:15.620
Gosh.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.060
Hello?

02:19.960 --> 02:21.460
It's an alarm.

02:25.630 --> 02:27.200
Just last September,

02:27.200 --> 02:29.700
there had been three break-ins
that led to murders.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.710
But the police still
haven't found a suspect...

02:31.710 --> 02:34.210
Kitty, slow down. Okay?
which is alarming the public.

02:34.210 --> 02:37.710
The police announced that they are
taking various approaches...

02:37.710 --> 02:39.910
to investigate
these three murder cases.

02:40.110 --> 02:42.950
Some people are suggesting
that the culprit targeted...

02:42.950 --> 02:44.520
wealthy senior citizens.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.420
But the police announced...

02:46.420 --> 02:48.660
that grouping individual cases...

02:48.660 --> 02:50.390
into one serial case
was a risky move.

02:50.690 --> 02:52.360
Without any definitive proof,
Hey. Take this.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.030
the police dispatched...
What's that?

02:54.030 --> 02:55.400
more resources
to question more people.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.300
So they are focused more on legwork.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.600
But they haven't found a lead yet.
Okay.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.400
The police are open...
Bye.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.270
to other possibilities such as...

03:03.270 --> 03:05.370
robberies or crimes of passion
by the victims' acquaintances.

03:05.370 --> 03:07.810
And the police are following up
on other possibilities.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.360
Listen. Detectives like us...

03:26.360 --> 03:29.360
who do all the legwork
catch the culprits.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.800
When we were canvassing
these neighborhoods...

03:32.800 --> 03:34.130
to the point that we got blisters,

03:34.130 --> 03:36.100
what did those district cops do?

03:36.100 --> 03:37.470
Yes. I'm glad you brought that up.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.370
Where were you in all of this?

03:39.710 --> 03:41.210
Right. You were at a sauna.

03:41.210 --> 03:42.980
I went there once!

03:42.980 --> 03:44.310
Yes. I know that.

03:44.310 --> 03:45.550
You went to the sauna once,
the go club once,

03:45.550 --> 03:46.880
and the Internet cafe once.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.680
Are you having fun playing
a computer game with high schoolers?

03:48.680 --> 03:50.750
You're 40 years old,
for goodness' sake.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.250
Do you think she's the type
to tell on me about that?

03:54.250 --> 03:57.390
You punk. I have ears too.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.630
I believe it is necessary
to set the boundaries...

04:00.630 --> 04:02.260
between our squad
and the Behavioral Analysis Team.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.360
Right. That's my point.

04:04.630 --> 04:07.370
They just wear suits
and act all cool.

04:07.370 --> 04:09.600
They just have meetings
like some scholars.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.970
What do you think they can do?

04:10.970 --> 04:12.810
As long as
they can pinpoint a suspect,

04:12.810 --> 04:14.440
it doesn't matter
if they have meetings...

04:14.440 --> 04:16.440
like scholars or standing
on their heads.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.640
What do you care?

04:17.640 --> 04:19.680
Entering the crime scene
as they please...

04:19.680 --> 04:21.380
is obstructing the investigation.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.820
Captain Kook isn't the chief
of the Forensics Squad anymore.

04:24.820 --> 04:27.590
And Song Ha Young was
always into playing the hero.

04:27.590 --> 04:30.620
He keeps crossing the line.
You know how he is.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.730
I won't participate
in making personal attacks.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.290
What?

04:35.430 --> 04:39.270
Other teams aren't happy
with the Behavioral Analysis Team.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.800
If there are no boundaries
between us and them,

04:41.800 --> 04:45.270
whenever we get cases,
there's bound to be a conflict.

04:45.270 --> 04:46.470
Listen.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.610
They are taking the lead
on their own.

04:48.610 --> 04:51.340
How can I stop them?
Gosh.

04:52.350 --> 04:54.780
Besides, they aren't really
getting in your way.

04:55.580 --> 04:56.920
They can actually help you out.

04:57.350 --> 04:59.720
Goodness. Did you all
have coffee this morning?

04:59.720 --> 05:01.520
Hello, sir.
Hello.

05:01.790 --> 05:04.390
Come on! What's the matter with you?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.390
What's going on in there?

05:07.960 --> 05:10.300
It's too early to be yelling
at this hour.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.700
Well, the thing is...

05:12.000 --> 05:14.030
Yesterday,
when Chief Kim Bong Sik...

05:14.030 --> 05:15.700
went to check out the area
in Jinjung-dong,

05:15.700 --> 05:17.270
he ran into Inspector Song.

05:17.270 --> 05:19.340
Darn it, that little...

05:21.370 --> 05:22.780
Gosh.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.110
It's...
Captain Yoon and I...

05:25.110 --> 05:26.910
also run into him whenever we go...

05:26.910 --> 05:28.620
to Suseong-dong or Gungok-dong.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.380
It seems like Inspector Song...

05:30.380 --> 05:32.350
is visiting all the scenes
on a daily basis,

05:32.750 --> 05:35.690
so people are talking.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.760
Captain Yoon.
Yes, sir.

05:39.030 --> 05:41.290
As police officers,
it is our job to catch criminals.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.630
Whether he's trying
to play a hero or not,

05:44.300 --> 05:46.400
let's not doubt
his genuine intentions.

05:47.370 --> 05:49.070
I don't doubt his intentions.

05:53.340 --> 05:56.210
Hello, sir.
What's going on?

05:57.340 --> 06:00.010
The Behavioral Analysis Team
reports directly to me.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.910
What's your problem?

06:02.220 --> 06:04.750
If you have a problem, talk to me.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.550
It's not a big deal, sir.
There was a small misunderstanding.

06:07.690 --> 06:09.920
Ban the Behavioral Analysis Team
from entering the scenes.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.320
Oh, that's what you want?

06:12.330 --> 06:13.660
That's it?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.200
Sure, fine.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.170
If you have a problem with that,
I'll be sure to let them know.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.300
Thank you, sir.
But the thing is,

06:23.870 --> 06:27.140
I can't stop them if they want
to conduct their own investigations.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.880
They're cutting down on sleep
to do that...

06:30.880 --> 06:32.650
on top of conscientiously completing
their own tasks,

06:32.650 --> 06:35.210
so I can't tell them not to do that.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.980
I can't dictate
how much sleep they get.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.820
Right, they're not kids.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.790
We're not asking you
to just go ahead and stop them.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.090
I think the Behavioral Analysis Team
needs to understand that...

06:46.660 --> 06:48.190
they're not
one of our investigation teams.

06:48.830 --> 06:50.930
Right, I also think...

06:52.270 --> 06:53.400
What's going on?

06:56.700 --> 06:59.070
Hurry to the scene in Hwanghwa-dong.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.570
A senior citizen was murdered.

07:00.810 --> 07:01.840
Hurry to the scene at once.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.710
Let's hurry.
Come on.

07:04.310 --> 07:06.180
Oh, I see. Got it.

07:06.610 --> 07:07.980
Come on. It's urgent.
Okay.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.280
It's in Hwanghwa-dong!

07:13.850 --> 07:15.020
Come on.

07:15.050 --> 07:17.990
Hey, get the car ready!
Yes, sir!

07:46.850 --> 07:50.120
Gosh, I didn't know that
so many people were into hiking.

07:50.190 --> 07:51.760
I did this all day yesterday,

07:51.760 --> 07:53.130
and I don't see an end in sight.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.700
At this rate,
I'll become a hiking expert,

07:56.700 --> 07:58.000
not a statistics expert.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.500
Hey, those in Forensics
have it way worse.

08:01.670 --> 08:04.840
Their hands have already turned
into feet,

08:04.840 --> 08:07.140
so they walk on all fours now.
Like this.

08:14.150 --> 08:15.980
Can't you laugh a little
even if it's not funny?

08:18.420 --> 08:20.420
What? Why did he have
to storm out like that?

09:04.760 --> 09:07.700
Another senior citizen was murdered
in Hwanghwa-dong.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.300
They all went to the scene
a little while ago.

Goodness. Hey! Get it done properly!

Sir, you can't come in here.
Why not?

09:22.720 --> 09:24.750
Go the other way.
This is crazy.

09:24.750 --> 09:25.850
Go the other way!
Darn it.

09:25.850 --> 09:28.350
I didn't mean to offend you.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.760
I just said to go the other way.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.290
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.130

Sir! You can't come in here.
Why not?

You can't come in here.

09:46.470 --> 09:48.270
You can't come in here.
Goodness. Move.

09:48.270 --> 09:49.880
Gosh, what is this?

09:52.310 --> 09:53.850
Chief! You can't touch that.

You know that
you can't touch anything here.

to lift all the fingerprints.

09:58.050 --> 10:00.190

You can't come in here now.

10:00.190 --> 10:01.790
No, stop!
My goodness.

10:01.790 --> 10:03.120

Hey.

10:15.100 --> 10:17.370
Hey, how did the fire break out?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.440
The culprit tried
to set the house on fire.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.570
Thankfully, the fire died out
after partially burning the body...

10:21.570 --> 10:22.840
and the ceiling.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.540
Then maybe it was someone else.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.480
We'd have to look into it further,
but a blunt weapon was used.

10:37.390 --> 10:38.990
Then why did the culprit
start the fire?

10:39.560 --> 10:41.660
Maybe there was something
that the culprit wanted to hide.

10:41.690 --> 10:43.760
We're looking into that too.

10:44.430 --> 10:46.000
Then I'll return to the office...

10:46.000 --> 10:47.370
and collect statements
from the bereaved.

10:47.370 --> 10:48.630
Okay, sure.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.800
How long do you think
this will take?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.240
There was a fire,
so I'd say about ten hours.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.040
By the way,
what's Kim Bong Sik doing inside?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.210
I have no idea. Why is he...

10:58.910 --> 11:00.710
I'll lift all his prints...

11:00.710 --> 11:02.250
and submit them as evidence.

All right, I'm sorry.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.350

11:05.350 --> 11:06.520
Take it easy.
Thank you.

and contaminate the scenes.

They said it'd take ten hours.

How many of these
did we find last time?

on the list of suspects again?

Did you come here to nag me?

is investigating the scene now.

11:25.470 --> 11:27.240

should return to the office.

about your team...

will get complicated for all of us.

and Superintendent Baek are here.

Why should I walk on eggshells
around him?

11:55.430 --> 11:58.000
We can't have your back forever.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.370
The two teams must respect
each other's boundaries.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.340
You were the one
who came up with this system.

12:02.340 --> 12:05.010
Exactly.
Just go back to the office and wait.

12:05.010 --> 12:07.780
We'll share all the updates
with you.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.380
Why must we argue about this now?

12:09.380 --> 12:12.450
Just go back to the office.
I'm so angry right now.

12:12.450 --> 12:15.620
Why is he standing there alone,
looking all serious?

12:18.220 --> 12:20.690
Let's go for a smoke.

12:20.690 --> 12:22.630
Sure, let's go.

12:22.630 --> 12:24.900
Go somewhere far.
I can smoke over there, right?

12:24.900 --> 12:26.830
Not within a 50m-radius.
Fine, I heard you!

12:28.100 --> 12:29.640
The culprit must've tried
to burn the house down.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.270
Yes, there's the burning smell.

12:32.310 --> 12:33.770
Who's the victim?

12:35.240 --> 12:37.410
A female in her 60s.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.780
A quiet alley
in an affluent residential area.

12:42.150 --> 12:44.120
Of course, I don't see
a single security camera.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.420
But an arson attempt.
That's a first.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.090
It was probably premeditated, right?

12:49.490 --> 12:52.320
But it's a little odd.

12:52.660 --> 12:53.990
What's odd?

12:53.990 --> 12:55.630
The 1st incident took place
on September 12.

12:55.630 --> 12:57.730
The 2nd one, on the 24th.
The 3rd one, on the 30th.

12:57.730 --> 13:01.430
The interval between the cases
had gone down from 12 to 6 days.

13:01.970 --> 13:03.670
But now,
it has increased to a month.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.870
If this really is
a premeditated serial murder case,

13:06.010 --> 13:09.280
such decreased intervals
and sporadic patterns...

13:10.310 --> 13:12.980
mean that the killer
is becoming bolder.

13:15.580 --> 13:18.880
However, it took the killer a month
to commit this murder.

13:21.290 --> 13:23.290
There must've been a reason.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.220
What could it be?

13:30.700 --> 13:32.600
Was it suicide?

13:32.630 --> 13:34.630
What caused the fire?
Was it attempted arson?

13:34.630 --> 13:36.570
Move back.
Did the fire kill the victim?

13:36.570 --> 13:37.940
Or was it murder?
Move back!

13:37.940 --> 13:39.470
Have you identified a suspect yet?

13:39.470 --> 13:40.670
Is that Yoon Tae Gu
from the Seoul HQ?

13:40.670 --> 13:42.880
There have been many murders lately.
How do you plan to prevent crime?

13:48.310 --> 13:50.820
Was the victim murdered?
Just a comment, please!

13:51.020 --> 13:53.320
What exactly happened?
Tell us!

13:53.420 --> 13:55.190
Is this a homicide case?
Tell us!

13:55.190 --> 13:56.320
Was the victim murdered...

13:56.690 --> 14:00.060
Earlier today, at around 11:10 a.m.,
on Thursday, October 30,

14:00.060 --> 14:02.030
Yoon Jung Yoon,
a 65-year-old female,

14:02.030 --> 14:04.200
was found dead in her home
in Hwanghwa-dong, Seoul.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.130
She was attacked
with a blunt weapon.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.300
Her husband, Han Jong Yong,

14:09.300 --> 14:11.200
saw that their house was filled
with smoke...

14:11.200 --> 14:13.610
upon returning home from work...

14:13.610 --> 14:15.310
and called it in.

14:15.310 --> 14:17.040
What was used to start the fire?

14:17.040 --> 14:19.510
We believe that the culprit used
newspaper and paper...

14:19.510 --> 14:21.550
to start the fire.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.920
Any lead on the culprit?

14:22.920 --> 14:25.890
We can't tell you anything
at the moment.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.650
We're restricting access
to the scene as we wait...

14:27.650 --> 14:30.920
for the Forensics Squad's
preliminary results,

14:30.920 --> 14:33.430
so we can't share any details
with you at the moment.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.160
I hope you all understand.

14:35.430 --> 14:37.630
Was anything stolen from the scene?
Cash or any valuables?

14:38.430 --> 14:39.570
How did she get in here?

14:39.570 --> 14:43.040
At the moment, it doesn't seem like
anything was stolen.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.170
Do you still think it was done
by someone who knew the victim?

14:45.170 --> 14:48.670
We are considering
every possibility.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.040
As I mentioned earlier,

14:50.040 --> 14:52.210
we're still waiting
for the preliminary results...

14:52.210 --> 14:53.980
Do you admit that this may be
connected to the cases...

14:53.980 --> 14:56.420
that occurred in Suseong-dong,
Gungok-dong, and Jinjung-dong?

14:57.620 --> 14:59.690
Serial murders
targeting affluent senior citizens.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.290
Do you admit it?

15:01.750 --> 15:03.160
Well...

15:03.820 --> 15:06.460
We plan to expand the investigation
keeping in mind...

15:06.560 --> 15:09.330
the possibility that the culprit
could be the same person.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.560
Do you think there was an accomplice
as in the Jijon Family case?

15:11.560 --> 15:12.970
There wasn't any accomplice?

15:13.100 --> 15:14.570
Are they related?

15:14.570 --> 15:17.040
Do you have any speculations?
Are the cases related?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.410
Excuse me, reporters. I apologize.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.340
I'm sure you have more questions,

15:21.340 --> 15:23.480
but that's all for today's briefing.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.580
We will do our best
to arrest the culprit,

15:26.580 --> 15:28.050
so please give us some time.

15:28.050 --> 15:29.180
Thank you.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.820
Where are you going?
That's it?

15:30.820 --> 15:33.290
Are those done by the same guy?
Is everything related?

15:33.490 --> 15:34.490
Breaking news.

15:34.490 --> 15:36.590
This morning in a residential area
in Hwanghwa-dong,

15:36.590 --> 15:39.230
a woman in her 60s was murdered.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.090
The police launched
an investigation.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.560
The police believe these cases
of wealthy elderly murders are...

15:43.560 --> 15:46.370
possibly planned as serial murder.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.830
The police identified the culprit
of the Hwanghwa-dong incident...

15:48.830 --> 15:50.840
as the same one who committed...

15:50.840 --> 15:52.910
the three previous murders
of the elderly.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.010
They repeatedly stated they would
expand the investigation...

15:56.010 --> 15:57.340
to a serial murder case.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.810
(Daehan Daily)

16:04.920 --> 16:07.090
("Police Admits the Elderly Murders
as Serial Murder")

16:07.090 --> 16:11.720
(Emergency Response)

16:12.790 --> 16:14.530
(Scientific Investigations Team)

16:24.140 --> 16:25.300
(Forensics)

16:34.750 --> 16:36.620
Why did he suddenly start a fire?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.020
He tried doing something
he had never done before.

16:41.090 --> 16:42.550
Did you find any inflammable?

16:42.860 --> 16:45.190
Check out this area first.
Okay, sure.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.830
He didn't prepare anything
in particular.

16:55.170 --> 16:56.800
I think he started it
with newspaper.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.770
If he didn't carry
any inflammable here,

16:58.770 --> 17:00.310
I don't think he sought after
psychological exhilaration...

17:00.310 --> 17:02.170
as most arsonists do.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.240
If he was after
psychological exhilaration,

17:04.480 --> 17:07.010
he would've stayed
and watched the fire grow bigger.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.280
He probably would have.

17:08.710 --> 17:11.380
I'm sure he came across
an expected situation.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.720
He either wanted to destroy
traces he didn't want anyone to see.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.060
Or it could've been his trace.

17:20.859 --> 17:22.089
He failed to open the safe.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.430
Maybe this was a copycat crime.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.900
He wasn't keen
on taking the valuables until now.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.770
But he used the same weapon.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.040
Triangular?

17:35.910 --> 17:38.640
Then let's check the body first.

17:44.580 --> 17:45.720
(Joy, prayer, thanks)

17:45.720 --> 17:49.490
He destroyed the cross.
An unnecessary act.

17:54.230 --> 17:56.860
Mallet. Hammer. Brick.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.900
We took everything we can find...

17:58.900 --> 18:01.300
to see if any of those
could leave a triangular mark,

18:02.230 --> 18:03.400
but none of those.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.470
Do you think
he made the weapon himself?

18:05.470 --> 18:06.710
The murder weapon?

18:06.710 --> 18:08.210
I mean, we can't seem to find it.

18:08.210 --> 18:11.240
His choice of a blunt weapon
rather than a sharp one shows...

18:11.810 --> 18:13.710
the anger built within this culprit.

18:15.410 --> 18:18.150
On what
has he become this furious...

18:18.350 --> 18:21.520
to brutally kill complete strangers?

18:22.190 --> 18:23.860
Let's check.

18:23.860 --> 18:25.220
May I borrow a notebook?

18:27.190 --> 18:28.990
Thank you.
First off, the front.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.800
One, two, three, four.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.700
On the head, one...

18:45.780 --> 18:47.380
He isn't after money.

18:47.450 --> 18:49.750
It wasn't done by an acquaintance
who holds a grudge.

18:50.850 --> 18:52.020
In that case,

18:53.550 --> 18:56.920
where did his anger
that ultimately made him...

18:58.420 --> 19:00.390
attack these helpless
wealthy victims stem from?

19:02.530 --> 19:03.700
Are you sure?

19:04.400 --> 19:06.770
Yesterday night,
he wanted to put that jacket on,

19:06.770 --> 19:08.400
but he changed into something else,

19:08.670 --> 19:10.670
then left it on the sofa
before he left.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.340
But come the morning,

19:18.340 --> 19:20.380
the jacket was gone.

19:21.050 --> 19:23.050
Maybe the victim moved it somewhere.

19:23.050 --> 19:25.320
So I asked the chief of Forensics
to find his jacket first.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.350
He looked for it twice,
but he never found it.

19:28.890 --> 19:31.290
He left the money and valuables,

19:31.720 --> 19:34.860
and all he took was a black jacket?

19:34.960 --> 19:37.300
It suddenly got chilly this morning.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.070
This is such a shame.

19:42.070 --> 19:45.070
If we had cameras in the alleys,
we would've found him by now.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.570
We put up many more
at the beginning of this year.

19:49.310 --> 19:51.410
When we never had these,
I never even thought about it,

19:51.410 --> 19:53.710
but I guess I began to feel this way
ever since we began to put them up.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.620
They're making the control center
or something next year,

19:56.620 --> 19:57.780
so that's something
to look forward to.

19:58.750 --> 19:59.750
Over there.

19:59.750 --> 20:03.620
(Mini Mart)

20:05.690 --> 20:06.960
They're all wearing black.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.430
But it's just a day's worth.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.200
Find someone in hiking boots.
Okay.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.140
He carried a big weapon around,

20:16.140 --> 20:18.000
so I'll find someone
with a backpack too.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.240
Once you screen them,

20:19.610 --> 20:22.140
ask the husband
if it's the jacket he lost.

20:22.140 --> 20:23.280
Yes.

20:23.910 --> 20:26.280
Goodness, Reporter Im Moo Sik.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.980
I always gave you the information.

20:29.580 --> 20:33.190
If we find anything,
I'll let you know first.

20:34.550 --> 20:35.820
Hey, wait.

20:36.520 --> 20:39.020
Why? Did you find something?

20:43.300 --> 20:44.800
(Gungok-dong, Hwanghwa-dong)

20:44.800 --> 20:47.130
Man, look at this guy.

20:47.130 --> 20:48.300
(Suseong-dong, Jinjung-dong)

20:48.430 --> 20:51.340
I'll call you back.
One second.

20:54.010 --> 20:55.170
Gil Pyo!

20:56.480 --> 20:59.810
This jerk.
What? Did you find anything?

20:59.810 --> 21:00.950
Listen up.

21:02.050 --> 21:03.180
Suseong.

21:04.150 --> 21:05.250
Gungok.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.820
Jinjung. Hwanghwa.

21:08.390 --> 21:09.560
What about them?

21:09.590 --> 21:11.520
They have the same consonants.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.660
Darn it.
Explain it so that I can understand.

21:13.660 --> 21:15.430
Suseong. S and S.

21:15.430 --> 21:17.060
Gungok. G and G.

21:17.060 --> 21:19.100
Jinjung.
J and J.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.600
Hwanghwa.
H and H!

21:24.540 --> 21:28.110
Look, they are all located
in places with good access.

21:28.310 --> 21:30.640
Not only are there
luxurious residential districts,

21:30.640 --> 21:33.350
it's accessible by public transit,
and all these towns have...

21:33.350 --> 21:35.380
a concentrated area
of adult entertainment businesses.

21:35.380 --> 21:36.480
So what?

21:36.520 --> 21:38.680
The investigation team says
he must've gone around in a car...

21:38.680 --> 21:40.350
because he was never seen...

21:40.350 --> 21:42.020
even though he committed
the crimes in a large area.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.720
But it might be quite the opposite.

21:43.890 --> 21:45.860
Oh, he uses public transit?

21:45.860 --> 21:48.530
In Tak said
there's a jacket missing, right?

21:48.530 --> 21:50.530
Yes, if that's true,

21:50.530 --> 21:52.630
it's another proof
for our second theory.

21:52.730 --> 21:55.030
The temperature dropped
even lower this morning,

21:55.030 --> 21:56.600
so if he didn't have a car,

21:56.600 --> 21:58.270
he would've needed
a jacket or something.

21:58.270 --> 22:01.810
We can make another assumption.
What is it?

22:01.810 --> 22:04.880
He could've needed to hide
his bloodstained clothes.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.080
If that's the case,

22:07.080 --> 22:09.680
then shouldn't we have
many more witnesses?

22:09.680 --> 22:11.320
I mean, he used public transit.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.820
Even if he went around
with bloodstained clothes,

22:13.820 --> 22:16.090
most people wouldn't have noticed...

22:16.890 --> 22:18.860
unless they saw him
near the crime scene.

22:18.860 --> 22:20.930
Right, you're right.

22:20.930 --> 22:23.430
He wouldn't go around
telling people he's a murderer.

22:23.560 --> 22:24.860
Also, surprisingly,

22:26.400 --> 22:28.600
people aren't
too interested in others.

22:28.670 --> 22:30.600
Due to their inattentiveness,

22:31.100 --> 22:33.110
they wouldn't get suspicious...

22:33.110 --> 22:35.510
nor perceive it as strange
even if they saw his bloody clothes,

22:35.510 --> 22:36.940
just as Hwang Dae Sun said.

22:37.810 --> 22:38.910
Yes.

22:44.380 --> 22:46.180

22:58.000 --> 23:00.330
That man. Is that the jacket?

23:07.470 --> 23:08.640
Hello?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.480
Yes, Chief.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.020
(Chief of Forensics, Oh In Tak)

23:20.290 --> 23:21.820
To sum up,

23:21.820 --> 23:23.320
the culprit
probably doesn't have a car,

23:23.320 --> 23:27.190
and he's a guy with a foot size
between 260mm to 265mm?

23:28.330 --> 23:29.460
One second.

23:32.060 --> 23:34.030
Hello, Captain Kook Young Soo
of Behavioral Analysis Team...

23:34.030 --> 23:35.300
Hey, In Tak.

23:35.730 --> 23:36.870
All right.

23:37.770 --> 23:40.170
Fax it over right away. Thanks.

23:42.980 --> 23:44.680
We can stop looking for the shoes.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.210
They found it?

23:46.650 --> 23:48.980
Which brand is it?
He'll fax it to me.

23:54.150 --> 23:57.020
Wait, how does this make any sense?

23:57.020 --> 23:59.830
Why doesn't it? It fits perfectly.

23:59.830 --> 24:02.630
Have you found any evidence
more trustworthy than this?

24:03.900 --> 24:05.760
You should dispatch some men
in Bangbae-dong.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.800
You need to stop the fifth murder!

24:36.060 --> 24:37.760
You're all here.
Take a look at this.

24:37.760 --> 24:38.860
You found it?
You found something?

24:38.860 --> 24:40.370
The hiking shoes...

24:40.870 --> 24:43.500
Why do you have this?

24:43.500 --> 24:46.510
If you want to get cranky,
you should do your job first.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.410
I don't want
any inconvenience either.

24:49.540 --> 24:50.580
What is it?

24:50.580 --> 24:53.580
Darn it, the chief of Forensics is
doing his job weirdly.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.110
Not as weirdly as the chief
of the Special Crime Squad.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.980
What?
You're with the superintendent.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.390
Okay.
Over here. This one.

25:00.390 --> 25:01.520
We found him.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.990
Yes, but you're a step too late.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.390
I mean the CCTV footage.

25:05.860 --> 25:07.690
We got a shot
of the back of the culprit.

25:16.900 --> 25:20.270
What are we supposed
to do with that?

25:20.410 --> 25:23.810
We're still in a tight spot
with or without leads.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.450
We won't be able
to find anything with that.

25:26.450 --> 25:27.550
Come to the conference room now.

25:27.550 --> 25:29.880
We caught the back of the culprit
on the security camera.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.520
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

25:36.620 --> 25:38.120
Did you forget something?

25:38.120 --> 25:40.690
Should I go and fetch it now?
No. Wait.

25:43.300 --> 25:45.830
It's not his face. It's his back.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.070
Right. Yes.

25:49.970 --> 25:52.200
Let's dispatch some people
in Bangbae-dong.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.940
And why don't we
interrogate people...

25:53.940 --> 25:55.440
with the same hiking shoes
in the area?

25:55.440 --> 25:57.310
There will be countless people
who own the same hiking shoes...

25:57.310 --> 25:59.780
of the same size just in Seoul.

26:00.050 --> 26:02.380
We won't be able to track people
who bought the shoes with cash.

26:02.380 --> 26:03.650
We should start
with the neighborhoods...

26:03.650 --> 26:05.250
like we're taking a census.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.790
I think doing the legwork
will give us accurate information.

26:07.850 --> 26:09.050
It's not just one neighborhood.

26:09.050 --> 26:12.220
As you know, these murders
took place all over Seoul.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.860
Sir, why are we going
to Bangbae-dong?

26:16.360 --> 26:17.700
What? Oh, that?

26:22.630 --> 26:24.400
All right. Listen up.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.340
Suseong. Gungok.

26:26.340 --> 26:28.070
Jinjung. Hwanghwa.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.980
Anything?

26:32.080 --> 26:33.680
You idiots.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.880
S and S. G and G.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.220
The syllables start
with the same consonants.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.620
Let's put out an APB.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.660
What nonsense is that?

26:46.660 --> 26:47.990
We must put out an APB.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.500
How could we put out an APB
with just that?

26:50.500 --> 26:53.330
Come on in. You're here. So join us.

26:53.330 --> 26:57.200
Come on in.
And take us step by step.

26:58.540 --> 27:01.840
We must broadcast it
on the nine o'clock national news.

27:02.970 --> 27:05.310
He's driving me crazy. Come on.

27:05.310 --> 27:07.380
But we know nothing about the guy
or even have a composite sketch.

27:07.380 --> 27:10.380
You want us to do that with just
the footage that shows his back?

27:10.380 --> 27:12.980
Having the footage of his back
won't make any difference.

27:13.050 --> 27:15.720
About 99 percent of the tips
we receive won't be useful.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.220
Then it will only complicate
our investigation.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.730
But when he keeps a low profile,

27:20.730 --> 27:22.390
we can buy time.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.860
I think it's a good idea.

27:23.860 --> 27:26.770
The cooling-off period was long
between the 3rd and 4th cases...

27:26.770 --> 27:29.100
Wait. What's a cooling-off period?

27:29.100 --> 27:31.500
It's a hiatus for serial killers.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.440
Hey, he didn't ask you.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.810
Come on.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.880
It took a month for him
to commit the fourth murder...

27:39.180 --> 27:40.480
because of the press.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.010
What about the press?

27:42.150 --> 27:45.450
Up to the third case,
his cooling-off period was short...

27:45.450 --> 27:46.920
because he was confident.

27:47.050 --> 27:48.250
What's going on?
But the press...

27:48.250 --> 27:50.060
raised suspicions of serial murder.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.560
And they started to pay attention
to each case individually.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.790
The moment he became confident,

27:56.430 --> 27:58.560
he hesitated for a bit
in case he might get caught.

27:59.230 --> 28:01.270
Who on earth did that?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.340
But he killed again.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.640
It means that the pleasure
from killing and his confidence...

28:09.640 --> 28:11.780
overweighed his fear
of getting caught.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.280
You're saying that
there could be another victim?

28:14.280 --> 28:18.080
Yes. He only hesitated.
He didn't stop there.

28:19.890 --> 28:23.520
Even if he kills again,
it won't be easy to catch him.

28:23.590 --> 28:25.920
That arrogant jerk.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.690
Subsection Chief Kim Bong Sik.

28:27.930 --> 28:30.760
Do I have to teach you
how to respect your colleagues?

28:32.200 --> 28:35.970
He's aware of his crimes
and our investigation progress.

28:36.170 --> 28:37.500
He's smart.

28:42.610 --> 28:45.980
Don't tell me that
you're buying this nonsense.

28:45.980 --> 28:49.010
The culprit will watch
the broadcast somewhere...

28:50.020 --> 28:51.450
because he pays attention
to the press.

28:51.450 --> 28:52.550
So...

28:53.650 --> 28:55.820
are you suggesting that
we give him a warning...

28:55.820 --> 28:57.890
that he could get caught?

28:58.860 --> 29:00.030
That's correct.

29:00.790 --> 29:03.560
He already committed four murders.

29:03.830 --> 29:05.260
He won't stop here.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.170
The only way to stop him
from striking again...

29:10.570 --> 29:11.770
is this.

29:12.540 --> 29:15.570
Stop him from striking again...

29:18.240 --> 29:20.410
He'll continue?

29:22.950 --> 29:26.120
But we should consider this
as making progress, right?

29:26.790 --> 29:28.250
We found the hiking shoes.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.520
And we got his back on camera.
I'm sure we'll find him soon.

29:30.860 --> 29:33.190
Everyone is working together.
He can't get away from this.

29:33.190 --> 29:34.360
You're right.

29:34.790 --> 29:36.360
Chu Chu, we'll give you a ride.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.460
No. It's okay.
The bus is still running.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.370
We have room. Let me drop you.
Yes.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.170
No. It's in the different direction.

29:42.270 --> 29:43.900
Taking the bus is more comfortable.

29:44.140 --> 29:47.840
Okay. I get it. You want to get away
from us as soon as possible.

29:48.010 --> 29:49.040
See you tomorrow.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.280
Okay. Goodnight.
Okay.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.780
Get home safely.
Goodnight.

29:51.980 --> 29:53.210
Bye.
Bye.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.310
(Murder cases in Suseong-dong,
Gungok-dong, and Jinjung-dong)

29:56.310 --> 29:57.920
(A high-end residential housing unit
in Suseong-dong)

29:57.920 --> 29:59.880
(Murder case in Hwanghwa-dong)

29:59.990 --> 30:03.090
Do you seriously believe
putting out an APB will work?

30:05.920 --> 30:07.330
Why not?

30:07.990 --> 30:09.290
With just that?

30:09.890 --> 30:11.260
You really should...

30:12.330 --> 30:14.230
take another class
on how to listen to your colleagues.

30:14.370 --> 30:15.500
What?

30:15.630 --> 30:18.000
He wants to use this as a warning...

30:18.900 --> 30:21.370
to stop the next murder.

30:22.210 --> 30:25.380
I thought everyone understood that.
But I guess you didn't.

30:25.580 --> 30:27.080
A warning? As if.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.610
Do you think our duty is
to scare people?

30:31.150 --> 30:32.780
If you can't understand this,

30:32.920 --> 30:35.390
following the majority
is also a way.

30:36.690 --> 30:37.820
Hey.

30:39.090 --> 30:42.760
I've been too nice to you.
How dare you talk to me like that?

30:42.760 --> 30:45.660
I really hope
you will stop being nice to me.

30:46.630 --> 30:49.270
Your personality
hasn't changed one bit.

30:49.270 --> 30:51.070
I bet you'll live a long life.
Right?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.310
What did you say?
I'm your fellow detective.

30:56.170 --> 30:59.540
But you still treat me like a woman.
Narrow-minded, shallow,

30:59.780 --> 31:03.210
biased, and even immature.
That's how your perception is.

31:04.420 --> 31:07.690
Gosh. You are also trying
to ruffle up my feathers today.

31:07.690 --> 31:10.990
And are you cool with ruffling up
other people's feathers?

31:10.990 --> 31:12.690
You little...

31:15.960 --> 31:17.130
Did you see that?

31:17.300 --> 31:20.900
If you weren't a woman,
I would have slapped you right away.

31:21.070 --> 31:22.870
I'm not slapping you
because you are...

31:28.910 --> 31:30.440
This is my answer...

31:32.010 --> 31:33.210
to what you did to me before.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.750
I thought I was over it.

31:39.050 --> 31:40.350
I guess I wasn't.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.630
Hey, Yoon Tae Gu!

31:49.290 --> 31:51.030
If you don't want me
to treat you like a woman,

31:51.030 --> 31:52.300
cut your hair!

31:52.300 --> 31:54.370
Don't give me that excuse
you're growing out for the victim!

31:54.830 --> 31:56.100
Come on!

32:17.650 --> 32:19.340
So I pushed for it.

32:19.650 --> 32:21.640
Do you think putting out
an APB will work?

32:22.590 --> 32:24.980
If he hides,
it will be harder to find him.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.560
Right.

32:27.560 --> 32:30.920
But stopping the next murder
is our top priority right now.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.720
Right. That's true.

32:34.070 --> 32:35.190
Yes.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.400
Drop me off there.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.490
There?
Yes.

32:39.370 --> 32:41.870
Good work.
Thanks. Bye.

32:41.870 --> 32:43.310
See you tomorrow.
Okay.

32:43.310 --> 32:44.430
All right.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.670
Gosh.

32:47.150 --> 32:49.170
Captain Kook.
Yes?

32:49.250 --> 32:51.350
Hold on.
What?

32:51.350 --> 32:52.870
Wait. I have something.

32:53.790 --> 32:55.450
My mother gave it to me
this morning.

32:55.450 --> 32:57.410
But I forgot about it all day.
I'm sorry.

32:57.620 --> 32:59.910
What is this?
Why are you apologizing?

33:00.160 --> 33:02.560
It's a present from me.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.820
Happy birthday.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.190
For me? Today is...

33:08.070 --> 33:10.020
Goodness.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.790
Hey, I'm an old man.
I don't need presents.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.940
People in our line of work
only memorize the crime dates.

33:15.940 --> 33:17.400
We always forget birthdays.

33:17.710 --> 33:19.470
Anyway, thank you.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.740
And please
thank your mother for me too.

33:22.910 --> 33:24.450
Sure.
You're making me blush.

33:24.450 --> 33:27.090
Gosh. Thanks. I mean it.
Sure.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.180
Okay.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.580
Song Ha Young is a nice gifter.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.020
Happy birthday to me.

33:46.070 --> 33:47.700
Gosh. What is it?

33:50.880 --> 33:52.130
Gosh. Right.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.370
Sorry, honey.

33:54.610 --> 33:56.050
I...
Happy birthday, honey.

33:56.050 --> 33:58.240
Happy birthday, Dad.
Happy birthday, Dad.

33:59.080 --> 34:03.660
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

34:03.660 --> 34:05.920
<i>Happy birthday to you, dear honey</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you, dear Dad</i>

34:05.920 --> 34:08.080
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

34:09.030 --> 34:11.989
Goodness. Thank you.
Make a wish now.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.520
Dad, you need to make a wish.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.520
Okay, hold on.

34:28.949 --> 34:31.050
Did you do it?
What did you wish for?

34:31.050 --> 34:32.050
It's a secret.

34:32.050 --> 34:33.280
Come on.
Come on.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.949
I'm so glad we got to wish you
a happy birthday before midnight.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.520
I know. Thank you.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.560
I love you.
I love you, Dad.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.219
I love you! And I miss you.
Me too. I love you too.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.929
My wish is...

35:08.490 --> 35:10.690
We have nothing on the suspect.
Not even a composite sketch.

35:10.690 --> 35:13.820
You want us to do that with just
the footage that shows his back?

35:14.190 --> 35:17.060
Having the footage of his back
won't make any difference.

35:17.060 --> 35:19.860
About 99 percent of the tips
we receive won't be useful.

35:19.860 --> 35:22.470
Then it will only complicate
our investigation.

35:22.470 --> 35:24.390
Do you think putting out
an APB will work?

35:25.440 --> 35:27.760
If he hides,
it will be harder to find him.

What if this just ends up
complicating our investigation?

Send it right away.

37:10.070 --> 37:13.300
I'm telling you. That's why.
Nothing yet.

37:22.250 --> 37:23.380
Attention, please.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.210
Hold on a moment.

37:25.620 --> 37:29.520
The phones will keep ringing
off the hook.

37:30.830 --> 37:32.490
I know this will make it harder
for all of us,

37:32.960 --> 37:35.390
but don't dismiss or ignore any info
you obtain through these calls.

37:35.570 --> 37:39.090
If you hear of anything suspicious,
let us know.

that we must prioritize...

37:41.040 --> 37:44.270
the calls from our tippers
over the ones from the reporters.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.500
Now, back to your calls.
I don't need your answer.

37:48.250 --> 37:49.370
Hello?

37:49.710 --> 37:51.250
Yes.
That's right.

37:51.250 --> 37:54.150
Yes, from now on...
Is that right?

37:54.150 --> 37:56.710
As for the Hwanghwa-dong case...
I'll take care of that.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.980
The footage shows a man walking.
He's wearing a black jacket.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.920
He takes a look around,
looking relaxed.

38:06.330 --> 38:08.400
The police have identified
this man in the footage...

38:08.400 --> 38:10.890
as the prime suspect in the case.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.470
The jacket he is wearing
matches the one...

38:14.470 --> 38:15.710
that is missing from the scene.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.710
And he was caught on this camera...

38:16.710 --> 38:19.200
immediately after
the incident took place.

38:19.580 --> 38:22.310
According to the police,
the size of this man's shoe print...

38:22.310 --> 38:24.220
matches that of the shoe print...

38:24.220 --> 38:27.580
found at the scene
of the senior citizen's murder.

38:27.990 --> 38:29.690
The MO seems similar as well,

38:29.690 --> 38:32.050
so the possibility that
the killer is the same person...

38:36.230 --> 38:39.500
How are you feeling? Better?

38:39.500 --> 38:42.570
Gosh, the commissioner
was so mean to me.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.970
Gosh.
Last night,

38:43.970 --> 38:46.360
when I went to his office
to get his approval on the search,

38:46.600 --> 38:48.910
he kept hitting me
in the back of the head,

38:48.910 --> 38:51.180
asking how we'd manage
to catch the killer with this alone.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.680
But you see, I'm almost 50 now.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.000
Goodness. He just can't quit
that habit of his, can he?

38:55.780 --> 38:59.070
I stayed up all night and managed
to persuade the commissioner,

38:59.380 --> 39:02.250
but what will happen to us
if this doesn't work?

39:02.250 --> 39:04.750
Well, it can't be undone now.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.230
Don't be scared.

39:08.230 --> 39:10.330
Let's wait and see what happens.

39:10.330 --> 39:13.030
The reporters are getting a thrill
out of this.

39:13.030 --> 39:14.430
They're watching us
with their eyes peeled...

39:14.430 --> 39:15.700
to see if we'd manage
to catch him...

39:15.700 --> 39:18.140
with this photo
that shows nothing but his back.

39:18.140 --> 39:21.700
Come on, Chief Heo.
Why are you being like this?

39:21.870 --> 39:23.310
Are you suddenly regretting
your decision?

39:23.310 --> 39:25.880
No, it's not that.
I'm just frustrated. That's all.

39:25.880 --> 39:29.570
It'd be amazing if we could
catch that scumbag with this,

39:29.710 --> 39:31.020
but it's also true
that it's more important...

39:31.020 --> 39:32.680
to prevent additional cases.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.310
You're right.

39:34.420 --> 39:37.080
I already let him hit me in the head
as if it's his punching bag.

39:38.060 --> 39:40.350
I don't care
if I'm on the chopping block.

39:41.660 --> 39:42.860
Let's go.

39:42.860 --> 39:44.590
Okay, let's go.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.370
I came to the right place.

40:07.750 --> 40:11.650
Go this way and then...

40:18.230 --> 40:20.150

40:27.570 --> 40:28.730

40:29.710 --> 40:31.830

40:32.610 --> 40:33.740
Yes, Director.

40:33.740 --> 40:35.110
I'm finally getting
an exclusive report.

40:35.110 --> 40:36.780
You're interfering
with the investigation.

40:36.780 --> 40:38.620

40:42.850 --> 40:43.980

40:44.020 --> 40:47.050

in front of the motel.

could you spare me a moment?

about this case.

40:59.770 --> 41:02.360
And this is
the only security footage of him.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.310
I just think it's odd.

41:04.310 --> 41:07.040

on a faceless suspect.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.270
I don't get it.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.550

the case.

41:12.850 --> 41:14.140

41:14.550 --> 41:17.040
Can you at least tell me your name
if I can't have your number?

41:19.160 --> 41:21.550

(Profiling Report, Suseong, Gungok,

46:51.890 --> 46:55.150
I don't think now is the right time
to hand this over.

46:57.830 --> 46:59.320
I know that too.

47:00.530 --> 47:02.420
I just think that they
really need a lead.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.630
I felt like there is a need...

47:06.500 --> 47:08.630
to examine and analyze
the culprit's behavior...

47:09.110 --> 47:10.860
as much as we can.
Now more than ever.

47:15.610 --> 47:16.950
It says here...

47:16.950 --> 47:20.510
"Effort in trying to steal valuables
is very little."

47:20.520 --> 47:22.420
What does this mean?
In the case of Hwanghwa-dong...

47:22.420 --> 47:24.290
there was an attempt
to try to open the safe.

47:24.290 --> 47:25.860
If stealing the valuables
was his purpose...

47:25.860 --> 47:27.390
it only makes sense
to kill the victim...

47:27.390 --> 47:29.150
after he's made them open the safe.

47:29.530 --> 47:30.950
But he did the opposite instead.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.530
Above that, it says,
"Character disorder severe enough..."

47:34.530 --> 47:37.890
"to commit a crime. Highly likely
he had issues with family members."

47:38.140 --> 47:39.800
Even if we can look into
his medical history...

47:39.800 --> 47:42.060
how can we know
if he has issues at home?

47:42.110 --> 47:43.910
For a person with this much rage,

47:43.910 --> 47:46.540
I'm sure that it showed
in his daily life too.

47:46.540 --> 47:49.000
We can't take a survey
of every single household though.

47:49.110 --> 47:50.650
It's not like we can ask...

47:50.650 --> 47:53.020
if they have a family member
who has a lot of anger.

47:53.020 --> 47:56.750
By the way, where is
Subsection Chief Kim Bong Sik?

47:56.750 --> 47:58.560
He said he was going to the sauna.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.890
My goodness.

47:59.890 --> 48:01.990
Just how much dirt
does he need to wash off?

48:01.990 --> 48:04.650
But here, it says,
"The culprit's crimes..."

48:04.830 --> 48:07.730
"planning and choice
of location and time..."

48:07.730 --> 48:09.530
"are too systematic.
It's unlikely that..."

48:09.530 --> 48:11.460
"he has an intellectual disability
or schizophrenia."

48:11.570 --> 48:15.570
"Therefore, there is a need
to focus the investigation..."

48:15.570 --> 48:18.030
"on people who have
an aggressive character disorder."

48:18.110 --> 48:20.570
I'm having trouble
understanding this part.

48:20.810 --> 48:23.250
What's the reason we have
to differentiate schizophrenia,

48:23.250 --> 48:26.450
intellectual disabilities,
and character disorders?

48:26.450 --> 48:28.790
Character disorder is an illness...

48:28.790 --> 48:30.590
when one shows extreme or deformed
forms of obsessive...

48:30.590 --> 48:33.480
dependent, avoidant,
or antisocial characteristics.

48:33.990 --> 48:36.230
But the truth is, everyone
makes little of this illness...

48:36.230 --> 48:38.160
so they don't take
active measures to treat it.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.550
You're saying there may not be
medical records of it then.

48:40.930 --> 48:42.200
Yes, that's right.

48:42.200 --> 48:46.040
Even if he did get treatment,
it probably didn't last long.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.100
The possibility of being
admitted to a closed ward...

48:49.070 --> 48:50.430
is extremely low too.

48:51.410 --> 48:54.430
Meaning character disorders
don't leave many clues.

48:56.310 --> 48:58.780
Are you sure the culprit
isn't someone...

48:58.780 --> 49:00.440
with an intellectual disorder
or schizophrenia?

49:00.820 --> 49:04.040
All right, let me
explain this to you easily.

49:04.320 --> 49:07.150
Patients with either schizophrenia,
intellectual disorder, delusion...

49:07.620 --> 49:11.050
It's hard for them to commit
premeditated crimes.

49:11.430 --> 49:13.600
I'm sure you know from looking at
the crime scene from this case.

49:13.600 --> 49:15.570
It's clean and there's no witness.

49:15.570 --> 49:16.570
You're right.

49:16.570 --> 49:18.470
Cho Hyun Gil wasn't
mentally ill either.

49:18.470 --> 49:20.840
What we're trying to tell you is...

49:20.840 --> 49:23.600
We shouldn't look for
mentally ill patients...

49:24.540 --> 49:25.930
who have been receiving
continued treatment.

49:26.340 --> 49:28.370
Instead, we should look for
a suspect who has a record.

49:28.550 --> 49:31.740
Although the chances are low.
That's what we mean.

49:31.850 --> 49:35.120
That means it will be harder
to narrow down a suspect.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.890
I thought you said you'd make it
easier. I'm more confused now.

49:37.890 --> 49:39.560
That's too broad.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.230
We don't have enough people as is.

49:41.230 --> 49:42.590
Based on what you're saying...

49:42.590 --> 49:45.320
every single citizen
is a suspect then.

49:45.530 --> 49:47.750
To be blunt,
who doesn't have a temper?

49:47.930 --> 49:51.190
Besides our benevolent
Superintendent Baek.

49:51.470 --> 49:53.890
In conclusion, these are
more or less just guesswork.

49:54.740 --> 49:55.740
Right?

49:55.740 --> 49:59.300
It's not like you gave us a specific
lead that we can investigate on.

49:59.780 --> 50:03.340
We can't mobilize the entire squad
just based on this.

50:09.220 --> 50:10.620
It's been over three months...

50:10.620 --> 50:13.510
and the police still don't have
a single lead on the culprit.

50:13.760 --> 50:16.230
He's a murderer
who killed seven people.

50:16.230 --> 50:19.490
You're talking as if
the police are incompetent.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.990
But they are doing their very best.

50:22.330 --> 50:24.940
That goes for the Hwanghwa-dong
case from last time too.

50:24.940 --> 50:27.690
They found an image of the culprit
from the CCTV footage.

50:28.110 --> 50:32.070
Also, they are actively
receiving tip-offs...

50:32.080 --> 50:34.700
so they will find a lead
on the culprit soon.

50:35.150 --> 50:38.740
It's already been over two months
since they released an APB.

50:39.020 --> 50:40.520
If they were relying on
the APB for a lead...

50:40.520 --> 50:42.680
they should've gotten one
a long time ago.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.260
Time is passing,
including this moment here.

50:45.260 --> 50:47.290

more anxious by the day.

50:47.290 --> 50:49.750
What do they plan on
doing about this?

50:50.160 --> 50:51.730
In order to strengthen
public security...

50:51.730 --> 50:54.930
on top of increasing
the number of patrolling officers,

50:54.930 --> 50:57.300
they have offered many solutions
like installing security cameras...

50:57.300 --> 50:59.060
in crime-ridden districts.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.990
They are currently executing
those solutions.

What is this?

52:00.560 --> 52:01.800
He's a murderer.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.130
They only got a picture of his back.

52:03.130 --> 52:04.870
How do they plan to catch him
with only a picture of his back?

52:04.870 --> 52:06.540

That's what I'm saying!

52:06.540 --> 52:08.960
How can they catch him?
Seriously.

52:13.210 --> 52:15.180
Gosh, he's an evil one, isn't he?

52:15.180 --> 52:16.510
Yes.
You're right.

52:16.510 --> 52:18.320
Why can't they catch him?

52:18.320 --> 52:20.340
Gosh, what's the police doing?

to catch a punk like this.

and continues
to commit the crimes in hiding,

53:35.770 --> 53:38.470

53:38.470 --> 53:40.130

53:45.140 --> 53:46.580

of the Korean police.

53:46.580 --> 53:47.640
Just as I expected of the police.

53:47.640 --> 53:50.050
When will they catch the culprit?
I'm too scared.

53:50.050 --> 53:52.380
The culprit will
definitely kill someone again.

53:52.380 --> 53:54.140
It was too rash
to start an open search.

53:54.220 --> 53:56.180
The culprit would only hide more.
Why would he come out?

53:56.320 --> 53:58.510
I'd trust my dog
before I trust the police.

54:00.260 --> 54:02.680
You wanted to make
the Behavioral Analysis Team,

54:02.890 --> 54:05.520
so I let you have your way,
but what have you done right?

54:06.130 --> 54:08.590
You began an open search
just by using a photo of his back,

54:08.800 --> 54:10.590
but you have no evidence?

54:10.630 --> 54:12.690
This only made
the police look ridiculous!

54:14.270 --> 54:15.500
How will you patch this up?

54:15.510 --> 54:16.830

54:16.970 --> 54:20.180
Our detectives are out there
running around and doing their best.

54:20.180 --> 54:21.580
And so are the men
in the Behavioral Analysis Team.

54:21.580 --> 54:23.000

54:27.250 --> 54:29.680
who killed seven people immediately!

54:29.890 --> 54:31.880
Put him before
those wordy reporters!

54:32.320 --> 54:34.020
While you were out on the field,

54:34.020 --> 54:37.020
you taught us a few ways,
and we tried everything.

54:37.430 --> 54:39.990
We asked around the crime scene,

54:40.100 --> 54:42.200
we talked to every delivery man
who goes around the area.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.500
We searched around
the internet cafes in the vicinity,

54:44.500 --> 54:46.340
then got a warrant
to search the base station,

54:46.340 --> 54:49.230
so we even searched every person
who used their phones in the area.

54:49.540 --> 54:52.630
But we still haven't found
a strand of the culprit's hair.

54:53.510 --> 54:57.370
The Behavioral Analysis Team
or whoever, we need to ask...

54:57.950 --> 55:01.650
and find a new method
of investigating this case.

55:01.650 --> 55:05.390
Yes, so just as the Analysis Team
reported on the profiling report,

55:05.390 --> 55:07.590
we plan on searching
for people with mental illnesses...

55:07.590 --> 55:09.860
who have visited the doctors
along with the investigation.

55:09.860 --> 55:11.050
Darn it.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.860
You didn't know that
I've been getting reports...

55:16.230 --> 55:18.330
that the Behavioral Analysis Team is
out on the field now, did you?

55:19.740 --> 55:22.510
Sorry?
They keep asking me...

55:22.510 --> 55:24.900
who those guys are
and complaining about them.

55:25.310 --> 55:27.710
I can only turn a blind eye
to those complaints for so long.

when they want to take part...

55:31.250 --> 55:33.210

55:36.220 --> 55:39.450

your excuses anymore.

Let's put an end to our obsession.

56:02.450 --> 56:04.380

too many cases to resolve...

56:04.380 --> 56:07.310
other than looking for some guy
who can't even be detected.

56:07.650 --> 56:11.040
You talk as if we're a huge burden
to the Special Crime Squad.

56:11.360 --> 56:12.690
You never even bother
to hear us out.

56:12.690 --> 56:14.880
Young Soo, that's not what happened.

56:15.130 --> 56:17.830
We began an open search for him
just with a photo of his back.

56:17.830 --> 56:20.430
The commissioner taught me
a big lesson when I went in...

56:20.430 --> 56:21.970
to have some documents approved.

56:21.970 --> 56:23.600
Oh, so you called us
to nitpick over that?

56:23.600 --> 56:27.040
Nitpick? I'm your superior.
Why would I do that with you two?

56:27.040 --> 56:28.500
If anything, I'd give you an order.

56:29.110 --> 56:31.910
All I'm saying is that
we've all done enough.

56:31.910 --> 56:33.940
What do you mean by enough?

56:33.940 --> 56:35.110
Are you telling us to give up?

56:35.110 --> 56:37.670
Hey, there is no giving up
when it comes to our cases.

56:38.850 --> 56:42.120
I'm saying there are many cases
we could resolve with that time.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.410
Come on.

56:43.750 --> 56:46.020
We never just sat on our hands.

56:46.020 --> 56:49.380

has done our duties by ourselves.

around the bush and tell me.

56:53.130 --> 56:54.290

56:55.070 --> 56:56.520

57:00.570 --> 57:02.670
with the Behavioral Analysis Team.

57:02.670 --> 57:05.170
They were never happy with us.
Good grief.

What can we do?

57:07.940 --> 57:09.680

57:09.680 --> 57:11.820
also are complaining
about how your team is...

57:11.820 --> 57:13.150
coming in and out
of the crime scenes.

57:13.150 --> 57:15.980
The only thing we can do is
investigate the crime scene.

57:16.390 --> 57:17.390
If you stop us from doing that...

57:17.390 --> 57:19.760
I mean, I just want to stop by
the crime scene...

57:19.760 --> 57:22.060
after the forensics are done,
so why do they complain about that?

57:22.060 --> 57:24.480
There are many other things
you can work on.

57:24.630 --> 57:27.930
You know, those documents
you took from the cabinets.

57:27.930 --> 57:31.070
You all study that
and create data too.

57:31.070 --> 57:34.740
That's our job,
so we'll manage, okay?

57:34.740 --> 57:36.710
Please don't stop us
from going to the crime scenes.

57:36.710 --> 57:38.200
There's nothing
he can do to stop us.

57:38.740 --> 57:39.930
We can go whenever we want to.

57:40.910 --> 57:43.150

in something else too.

Let's go.

57:59.200 --> 58:01.400
I'm talking to him right now.

It's my first time
having a serious talk with him.

58:04.330 --> 58:06.860
You don't have to listen.
There's nothing serious about it.

58:07.070 --> 58:08.230

another crime to hide?

59:29.950 --> 59:31.110
Or...

59:32.720 --> 59:35.220
is he still planning another crime?

when the crimes will start again.

59:50.140 --> 59:51.400

59:52.840 --> 59:55.640
that you decided to begin
the open search all by yourself.

59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.670
The Special Crime Squad
isn't incompetent...

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.610
to a point we'll blindly follow
a rash decision.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.250
From the outside,

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:11.950
it may seem like
the investigation is standing still.

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.720
Until the moment
we catch the culprit,

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.090
even we sometimes feel that way.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.730
However,

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:24.560
we came to this choice altogether.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:29.500
What doesn't change is
how we came to the same decision,

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:32.510
that all we want is
to catch the culprit.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.780
What's more important than
wanting to catch the culprit is...

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.710
actually catching the culprit.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.420
We will catch him. Certainly.

01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:51.420
He will not stop.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.360
We'll catch him before he goes on.

01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.630
I thought it would work
once we stopped him.

I look through the daily reports,

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.940

of a crime in that same pattern.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:27.140
Do you think it was done by the same guy?

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.650
It's similar to the guy
we're looking for.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:30.910
The murder weapon, MO,
and the time periods are different.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.320
But what if it's what we speculated?

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.980
Because he failed to get
what he wants out of this?

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.640
Then Korea
has two serial killers now.
