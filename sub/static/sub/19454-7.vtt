Previously on

00:03.004 --> 00:04.336
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:05.671
<i> Did any of the original six</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:06.805
<i>win two challenges?</i>

00:06.807 --> 00:08.007
<i> I think it's better</i>

00:08.009 --> 00:09.341
<i>not to strut around and be like</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:11.176
<i>a peacock when you win.</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:12.611
<i>Ben de LA creme.</i>

00:12.613 --> 00:14.146
<i> You're gonna face off</i>

00:14.148 --> 00:16.815
<i>in a rap battle royale.</i>

00:16.817 --> 00:19.451
<i> My name says it all </i>
<i> ain't no need </i>
<i> to try to force it </i>

00:19.453 --> 00:22.254
<i> look at my body </i>
<i> in this brand new corset </i>
<i> if you're looking </i>

00:22.256 --> 00:24.590
<i> for a dude </i>
<i> or in the precious mood </i>
<i>[Record scratches]</i>

00:24.592 --> 00:27.126
<i> Just take a second </i>
<i> to see how this goes </i>
<i> rhinestones-- </i>

00:27.128 --> 00:30.229
<i>ugh.</i>
<i> Uh-oh.</i>
<i>You freaked yourself out.</i>

00:30.231 --> 00:34.133
<i> This is not something</i>
<i>that I'm accustomed to.</i>
<i>I lip-synch for a living.</i>

00:34.135 --> 00:39.471
<i>That's what I do.</i>
<i> Courtney Act,</i>
<i>you're resting on pretty.</i>

00:39.473 --> 00:46.378
<i>Don't be a cliche, my dear.</i>
<i>Adore Delano, you are the winner</i>
<i>of this week's challenge.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:51.917
<i>[Applause]</i>
<i>Trinity K. Bonet,</i>
<i>shante, you stay.</i>

00:51.919 --> 00:57.056
<i>My dear Milk, sashay away.</i>
<i> [Silent]</i>

00:57.058 --> 01:03.429
<i> Ooh, that was a tough one.</i>

01:03.431 --> 01:04.396
<i> Holy crap-ola.</i>

01:04.398 --> 01:05.397
<i> Oh, Milk.</i>

01:05.399 --> 01:08.734
<i> Milk is gone.</i>
<i> Aw.</i>
<i> It's milkin' time.</i>

01:08.736 --> 01:10.836
<i> [Together] Aw.</i>
<i> Poor</i> <i>leche.</i>

01:10.838 --> 01:12.571
<i> I'm in the bottom two again,</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:14.440
<i>and I'm really frustrated.</i>

01:14.442 --> 01:18.977
<i>It's hard when so many of the</i>
<i>challenges are something that</i>
<i>I'm not accustomed to and</i>

01:18.979 --> 01:23.982
<i>so many of the girls here are.</i>
<i> Congratulations to</i>
<i>miss thing on her first big win.</i>

01:23.984 --> 01:25.984
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> You deserve it.</i>
<i> You deserve it.</i>

01:25.986 --> 01:28.320
<i>You look fabulous.</i>
<i> Yeah, motherfucker.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:28.322 --> 01:31.490
<i> What am I, chopped liver?</i>
<i> You were in the top three.</i>
<i>Congratulations, madam.</i>

01:31.492 --> 01:34.726
<i> Yeah, congratulations.</i>
<i> Finally.</i>
<i> Showing your shit--</i>

01:34.728 --> 01:38.764
<i>literally.</i>
<i> Must be jelly.</i>
<i> Jam don't shake.</i>

01:38.766 --> 01:41.733
<i> I purposefully didn't get in</i>
<i>the top three on this one</i>
<i>so I wouldn't have to stay on</i>

01:41.735 --> 01:44.570
<i>my feet for as long.</i>
<i> [Together] Aw.</i>
<i> Sure.</i>

01:44.572 --> 01:46.171
<i> Some of de LA's wins have</i>

01:46.173 --> 01:47.706
<i>boosted the size of her head.</i>

01:47.708 --> 01:53.512
<i>Hopefully she doesn't tip over.</i>
<i> I was kind of like a bit</i>
<i>miffed at Ru saying that I was</i>

01:53.514 --> 01:58.450
<i>relying on pretty, 'cause I feel</i>
<i>like I've been giving a lot of</i>
<i>performance and theatrics</i>

01:58.452 --> 02:00.619
<i>is Ru not seeing</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:03.021
<i>that I am doing my best?</i>

02:03.023 --> 02:07.092
<i>I mean, perhaps just my pretty</i>
<i>was blinding him, and that's all</i>
<i>he could see.</i>

02:07.094 --> 02:10.562
<i>I definitely think</i>
<i>that performance</i>
<i>is more important than look.</i>

02:10.564 --> 02:12.798
<i> It is.</i>
<i> But that's what just happened</i>
<i>with Milk.</i>

02:12.800 --> 02:16.368
<i>They didn't beat Milk up as much</i>
<i>for the rap, but they beat him</i>
<i>up about the runway look,</i>

02:16.370 --> 02:19.972
<i>and mine was dead on.</i>
<i>But me and Milk were</i>
<i>in the bottom.</i>

02:19.974 --> 02:23.342
<i> But don't you think at some</i>
<i>point they get tired of hearing,</i>
<i>"well, this isn't my thing.</i>

02:23.344 --> 02:26.311
<i>Maybe the next one"?</i>
<i>And it's always a situation</i>
<i>that you're not comfortable</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:29.314
<i>with.</i>
<i>Is it always your excuse?</i>
<i>I mean, do you not feel that?</i>

02:29.316 --> 02:32.651
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> That's all that I ever hear.</i>

02:32.653 --> 02:34.019
<i>Every time she's in front of the</i>

02:34.021 --> 02:35.854
<i>judges, she goes into this long</i>

02:35.856 --> 02:37.689
<i>drawn-out speech about how</i>

02:37.691 --> 02:39.191
<i>she tries and how this is not</i>

02:39.193 --> 02:40.259
<i>her thing.</i>

02:40.261 --> 02:44.963
<i>I can be sympathetic to</i>
<i>a certain point.</i>
<i>It just gets old.</i>

02:44.965 --> 02:50.969
<i> It's not hard for you to</i>
<i>complain about something that</i>
<i>you're already good at,</i>

02:50.971 --> 02:55.040
<i>so you don't know how I feel.</i>
<i> I'm not being nasty about it.</i>
<i>I just think that does have</i>

02:55.042 --> 03:00.045
<i>something to do with it.</i>
<i>Are you listening?</i>
<i>I'm trying to help Trinity,</i>

03:00.047 --> 03:04.583
<i>but if she doesn't change her</i>
<i>attitude, she's not gonna last</i>
<i>long in this competition.</i>

03:04.585 --> 03:08.453
<i> Well, kiss my ass.</i>

03:08.455 --> 03:12.191
<i> </i> <i>RuPaul Drag Race</i>
the winner of <i>RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i> receives

03:12.193 --> 03:18.797
a sickening supply of
Colorevolution cosmetics
and a cash prize of $100,000.

03:18.799 --> 03:24.069
With extra special guest judges
lainie kazan
and leah remini.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.404
<i>RuPaul Drag Race</i>

03:25.406 --> 03:26.805
may the best woman

03:26.807 --> 03:28.440
best woman win

03:28.442 --> 03:29.808
[tires screeching]

03:29.810 --> 03:37.349
Good morn-ting, LA-ties.
Good morn-ting.
14 queens began this

03:37.351 --> 03:40.886
competition and only
eight remain.
Milk's gone.

03:40.888 --> 03:46.291
Gia's gone.
Who's gonna be next?
[Mouthing words] Not me.

03:46.293 --> 03:51.496
[Shemail siren wails]
[All exclaiming]
Ooh, girl, you got shemail.

03:51.498 --> 03:58.337
A queen's empire has to start
with a strong foundation,
a smoky eye, and a cherry lip.

03:58.339 --> 04:02.674
So put your money
where your mug is.
Hey, it's worth it.

04:02.676 --> 04:07.179
And so am I.
[Laughs]
Ooh.

04:07.181 --> 04:10.082
Yes.
Photo shoot?
Hello, hello, hello.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.185
All: Hey.
Hello.
Wow.

04:13.187 --> 04:19.625
For today's mini challenge,
I want you to lend a hand to
Michelle Obama's "let's move"

04:19.627 --> 04:27.366
program by making fruits and
vegetables sexy and appealing.
[Singsong] Oh, scruff pit crew.

04:27.368 --> 04:32.804
[All grunting rhythmically]
Oh, my goodness, get a load
of that rutabaga.

04:32.806 --> 04:37.209
[Laughter]
Delicious.
Now, you need to drag out

04:37.211 --> 04:42.714
your digits and then hand model
this farm-fresh produce.
I know I would nail

04:42.716 --> 04:45.617
this motherfucker.
[Laughter]
Literally.

04:45.619 --> 04:52.457
Let's move.
[Energetic pop music]

04:52.459 --> 04:57.629
All right, first up,
Ben de LA creme,
Seattle's premier hand model.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.299
Does anything satisfy

05:00.301 --> 05:01.800
like a banana?

05:01.802 --> 05:05.003
One skin, two skin, three skin,

05:05.005 --> 05:06.905
<i>four</i> skin.

05:06.907 --> 05:07.806
[Laughter]

05:07.808 --> 05:09.875
Are you ready to bust

05:09.877 --> 05:11.343
a butternut squash?

05:11.345 --> 05:14.179
Joslyn Fox showing off a pair

05:14.181 --> 05:15.347
of cantaloupes.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.982
Before you ball it,

05:16.984 --> 05:17.849
clean it out.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.117
Yes.

05:19.119 --> 05:19.785
Spank it.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.186
Bad melon.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.255
The mighty peanut grows

05:23.257 --> 05:25.957
underground in the rich soil

05:25.959 --> 05:27.793
of azusa, California.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.727
[Chuckles]

05:28.729 --> 05:30.028
Ooh, that's some rough

05:30.030 --> 05:31.430
nut play, girl.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.564
[Laughs]

05:32.566 --> 05:33.632
Yeah, shuck it.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.100
Mmm, you've got to

05:35.102 --> 05:36.234
cream that corn.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.302
Cream it.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.805
The true carrot connoisseur

05:39.807 --> 05:41.440
prefers the long,

05:41.442 --> 05:44.109
deep in girth carrot.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.511
That sweet potato is nice.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.080
The darker the skin,

05:48.082 --> 05:49.881
the sweeter the potato.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.149
Uh-huh!

05:51.151 --> 05:53.785
Just like drag queens, cucumbers

05:53.787 --> 05:56.288
are best enjoyed when they're

05:56.290 --> 05:58.690
young, because older cucumbers

05:58.692 --> 05:59.558
tend to get bitter.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.727
[Laughter]

06:01.729 --> 06:08.166
Nice work, ladies.
The winner is...
Laganja Estranja.

06:08.168 --> 06:14.473
[Applause]
Condragulations.
This week, the main challenge

06:14.475 --> 06:19.111
is personal.
I am launching my first-ever
makeup line...

06:19.113 --> 06:23.148
[Gasps]
RuPaul's Glamazon
by Colorevolution,

06:23.150 --> 06:30.188
and I'm entrusting each of you
to help me market it.
I need you to create 30-second

06:30.190 --> 06:35.761
commercial campaigns that target
today's woman.
You'll be working in pairs,

06:35.763 --> 06:43.101
and because I own 51% of this
damn company, I'll be casting
your teams.

06:43.103 --> 06:48.774
So we're gonna be paired up
with someone, which is good,
I guess.

06:48.776 --> 06:55.247
Depends on who it is.
First up, Adore and Laganja.
You'll be marketing toward

06:55.249 --> 07:02.187
mean girls, spoiled teenagers
obsessed with beauty and texting
and tweeting and twerking.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.822
Secretly I am excited to work

07:03.824 --> 07:05.157
with Laganja because when we're

07:05.159 --> 07:06.458
not competing, we're, like,

07:06.460 --> 07:07.659
really cool, and she's

07:07.661 --> 07:08.860
the coolest bitch ever.

07:08.862 --> 07:13.865
And because Laganja won
the mini challenge,
you get extra time on set.

07:13.867 --> 07:20.305
Sickening.
Next, Courtney and joslyn.
Your target is hot mamas.

07:20.307 --> 07:23.108
I idolized Courtney before

07:23.110 --> 07:24.543
I came into this competition.

07:24.545 --> 07:28.413
Meeting her was an
accomplishment, so getting to
work with her is kind of

07:28.415 --> 07:36.021
surreal.
[Heavenly harp music]
Next, Bianca and Trinity.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.257
Didn't I say to the universe
that I do not want to work
with Trinity again?

07:39.259 --> 07:45.397
Thanks, Ru, you shady bitch.
I'm assigning you glamorous
working girls,

07:45.399 --> 07:50.001
from hookers to CEOs.
I just don't want
to work with Bianca.

07:50.003 --> 07:55.407
I just want to work by myself.
I want a challenge where I could
just think on my own.

07:55.409 --> 08:00.011
And that leaves
Ben de LA creme
and Darienne Lake.

08:00.013 --> 08:04.316
Really?
Really?
You'll target the cougar

08:04.318 --> 08:09.287
demo, mature ladies who only get
sexier with the passing years.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.155
I feel like there's been

08:10.157 --> 08:11.523
a little bit of tension between

08:11.525 --> 08:13.625
Darienne and I lately, but I

08:13.627 --> 08:15.293
think that she's super-talented,

08:15.295 --> 08:16.761
so I think this is a good

08:16.763 --> 08:18.063
pairing.

08:18.065 --> 08:23.735
Gentlemen, start your
engines, and may the best woman
win.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.071
All right, well, I just--
I'm just writing, like,
stupid little shit...

08:26.073 --> 08:28.907
Okay.
Something very bitchy for
the--for the demographic

08:28.909 --> 08:31.543
kind of thing.
Right, like the mean girls
but, like, rich.

08:31.545 --> 08:35.280
Adore and I have an advantage

08:35.282 --> 08:36.381
because we've worked together

08:36.383 --> 08:38.316
many times in the outside world.

08:38.318 --> 08:42.721
I'm just really nervous that
Adore will overshadow me
and that I won't be the star.

08:42.723 --> 08:48.193
"This sassy, sexy, sickening
product..."
[Chuckles]

08:48.195 --> 08:51.162
Mm.
We could say, "now that
we got our hands on

08:51.164 --> 08:55.166
this bitching makeup..."
[Laughs]
Fuck.

08:55.168 --> 08:59.838
So Laganja has ideas,
and I mean, I was raised right,
so all I can do is nervous laugh

08:59.840 --> 09:02.607
at them because I don't know
how to respond to them.
I'm not gonna say, "no, bitch,

09:02.609 --> 09:05.310
that's an awful idea.
Mine is better."
But that was the truth

09:05.312 --> 09:10.215
of the situation.
"All the hot boys will be
kissing these coated lips,"

09:10.217 --> 09:12.784
or something like--
um...
I don't know.

09:12.786 --> 09:17.689
I want to be more mean.
Like, "sorry, Stacy,
but your boyfriend's mine now."

09:17.691 --> 09:19.791
So, like, I'm putting on
the lip gloss, like,
"I can sleep

09:19.793 --> 09:22.661
with anyone I choose."

09:22.663 --> 09:28.466
So I'm picturing us maybe
to be, like, drunk lushes.
Oh, okay.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.468
You know, like--
have Pinot grigio
in the afternoon.

09:30.470 --> 09:33.538
Yeah, Pinot grigio
in the afternoon.
Okay, okay.

09:33.540 --> 09:38.310
I cannot even wrap my brain
around it at this moment that
I'm actually doing this thing

09:38.312 --> 09:42.647
with Courtney Act herself.
She has so much respect for me,
and I, of course, have the

09:42.649 --> 09:47.285
utmost respect for her.
I think, like, we should do
makeovers, like...

09:47.287 --> 09:50.121
Does one of us want to be...
In drag.
Like, a before, and one of us

09:50.123 --> 09:53.925
want to be after?
Imagine if you're
the before?

09:53.927 --> 09:58.563
But the problem is no one
would ever believe that you were
the after, right?

09:58.565 --> 10:02.400
Coming up...

10:02.402 --> 10:03.468
How are you gonna sell

10:03.470 --> 10:04.536
your working girl?

10:04.538 --> 10:05.203
I'm just gonna put

10:05.205 --> 10:05.870
my best foot forward.

10:05.872 --> 10:06.671
I don't want to hear,

10:06.673 --> 10:07.439
"I'm just gonna,"

10:07.441 --> 10:09.040
because you've said that before,

10:09.042 --> 10:09.975
and you know what?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.109
I'm not going to sit here and

10:11.111 --> 10:12.310
sell you any promises, because I

10:12.312 --> 10:13.578
don't know exactly what's gonna

10:13.580 --> 10:15.814
happen when I get out there.

10:15.816 --> 10:20.585
[Laughs]

10:20.587 --> 10:25.690
[Laughs]

10:25.692 --> 10:29.527
Okay, girl, every bitch prop
we've ever needed--dogs, makeup,
cell phone--

10:29.529 --> 10:32.864
we're gonna give it to them.
Yells.
Today our main challenge is

10:32.866 --> 10:38.336
to come up with a concept and
shoot a 30-second commercial
for RuPaul's Glamazon

10:38.338 --> 10:43.008
by Colorevolution.
Hello, hello, hello.
All: Hello.

10:43.010 --> 10:47.379
Hello, hello, hello.
Is this the Glamazon
school of modeling?

10:47.381 --> 10:51.616
Why, yes, it is.
[Laughs]
De LA and Darienne.

10:51.618 --> 10:55.520
Both: Hi.
You all are marketing to?
Both: Cougars.

10:55.522 --> 10:59.224
Now, do you know any cougars?
We are cougars.
I'm too young and pretty

10:59.226 --> 11:01.893
to be a cougar.
[Laughs]
So...

11:01.895 --> 11:06.698
And a lot of, you know,
cougars are delusional.
Right, right.

11:06.700 --> 11:11.636
So what do you have planned?
Well, why don't you start,
'cause we have some of

11:11.638 --> 11:13.905
the notes here?
Okay.
We're definitely thinking

11:13.907 --> 11:18.176
sort of that--
oh, no, I'll let you start.
"Why don't you start?

11:18.178 --> 11:22.814
Uhh..."
[Laughter]
So how's it going

11:22.816 --> 11:28.653
working with de LA?
We're working together
as much as positive and negative

11:28.655 --> 11:31.823
can, you know--but, no.
[Laughs]
What do you mean?

11:31.825 --> 11:37.595
We're very magnetic.
Opposites do attract, so...
So are you opposites?

11:37.597 --> 11:42.000
I don't think we are.
I think we have different
working styles, but...

11:42.002 --> 11:47.672
All right.
So tell me about
your marketing campaign.

11:47.674 --> 11:52.343
We're marketing to
the modern cougar and
the cougar's body as a temple

11:52.345 --> 11:55.647
that has probably undergone
some renovations...
Sure.

11:55.649 --> 12:00.452
That could use a fresh coat
of paint to cover some of
the newly reworked foundation.

12:00.454 --> 12:05.824
Okay.
This product is very, very near
and dear to my heart, so I want

12:05.826 --> 12:09.561
you to respect the product.
Both: Yeah.
I'm absolutely positive

12:09.563 --> 12:13.865
it's gonna turn out fantastic.
All right, good.
Just sell my makeup.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.034
Yes.
All right, get back to work.
Thanks.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.037
Thank you, Ru.
All right.
Hey, Trinity.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.206
Hey, Bianca.
Hello.
Hi, hi, hi.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.110
So how are you gonna sell
my product?
I am a ceo with four

12:25.112 --> 12:28.646
children, and she's a hooker.
[Laughs]
I'm on my way to a meeting,

12:28.648 --> 12:30.648
and she's on her way
to a customer.
Uh-huh.

12:30.650 --> 12:35.754
And as I'm explaining the
product, she tells the world...
"Child, I'm"--

12:35.756 --> 12:39.023
[sighs]
"Child, I'm on these streets
all night, and it's very

12:39.025 --> 12:42.794
important that I keep
my sassy, sexy look up.
I use my RuPaul--

12:42.796 --> 12:47.398
I use my RuPaul's...
Glamazon by Colorevolution."

12:47.400 --> 12:52.370
You know, the judges have
called you out
on your confidence before.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.939
How are you gonna turn
that around?
I'm just gonna put

12:54.941 --> 12:57.609
my best foot forward.
I don't want to hear,
"I'm just gonna"...

12:57.611 --> 13:00.879
I'm--I'm--
because you've said that
before, and you know what?

13:00.881 --> 13:04.482
I'm not going to sit here and
sell you any promises, because I
don't know exactly what's gonna

13:04.484 --> 13:11.856
happen when I get out there.
Am I the first person
to call you out on this issue

13:11.858 --> 13:14.759
with projecting and being
more out there?
This is--

13:14.761 --> 13:17.862
it's honestly all new to me.
I've never had a problem
with the way that I talk

13:17.864 --> 13:21.132
or communication or anything.
But it's more than just
the way that you talk.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.936
It's a projection thing,
you know.
I'm trying to drag, pun

13:24.938 --> 13:28.673
intended, yourself out, 'cause
when I see you lip-synch,
I see it there.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.075
It's there.
Exactly.
You have to transfer

13:31.077 --> 13:35.013
that exact same fire
into other areas.
I know you have it.

13:35.015 --> 13:39.350
It's just you have to figure out
if you're willing to let that
wall down.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.820
I'm counting on you to help
drag it out of her.
I'ma do it.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.255
I'ma do it.
We're gonna work it out.
You got it.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.458
And get back to work.
We'll do it. We'll do it.
Come on, we can do this.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.029
So all I'm doing is encouraging
this bitch.
I know she has what it takes

13:51.031 --> 13:54.899
to do these challenges.
She just needs to apply herself.

13:54.901 --> 14:02.874
We're about to shoot our

14:02.876 --> 14:05.143
commercial for RuPaul's Glamazon

14:05.145 --> 14:06.578
by Colorevolution.

14:06.580 --> 14:10.515
Our mean team girls.
And I think we look
fucking cool.

14:10.517 --> 14:15.253
Like, if we went to school,
we would rule that school.
Sell me some cosmetics.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.656
You know, I may not be as funny

14:18.658 --> 14:19.490
as Adore.

14:19.492 --> 14:24.295
Her personality really does
shine through.
I just really want the judges to

14:24.297 --> 14:29.467
see that I do have something
special and unique.
All right, ladies, action.

14:29.469 --> 14:33.838
I know all the losers sitting
alone at lunch right now
are feeling so much safer.

14:33.840 --> 14:38.476
Sorry, Stacy,
but your boyfriend is mine now.
And cut.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.046
Laganja, I'm wondering if...
[In valley girl voice]
We could just have a little bit

14:42.048 --> 14:45.450
more of, you know...
Oh, my God.
Oh, like my Rachel Zoe voice.

14:45.452 --> 14:50.922
No.
Nothing can satisfy our rich
tastes in advanced products.

14:50.924 --> 14:57.729
But now, thanks to RuPaul's
Glamazon by Colorevolution,
our faces stand out amongst the

14:57.731 --> 14:59.797
trolls in our high school hall.

14:59.799 --> 15:07.906
Okay, moving on.
Blow picture.
Oh, yeah.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.676
Now, spin back to camera.
Yes.
Look over that shoulder

15:11.678 --> 15:16.114
at the camera.
Together.
Yeah.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.850
[Laughs]
Okay, one, two, three,
look over the shoulder.

15:18.852 --> 15:21.886
[Sputters]
We lost an earring.
Work together.

15:21.888 --> 15:27.292
Turn the other way.
[Both laughing]
Cut.

15:27.294 --> 15:31.963
[Laughs]
That's a wrap, ladies.
All right, come on down.

15:31.965 --> 15:37.769
Hot mamas.
Will you be our mailman?
And this is your package.

15:37.771 --> 15:44.309
[Laughs]
So you are some stay-at-home
moms looking for some glamour,

15:44.311 --> 15:47.979
is that right?
We've modeled our characters
on the real housewives

15:47.981 --> 15:51.549
of America.
So what city would
your housewives be from?

15:51.551 --> 15:58.489
Glamazonia.
[Snorts]
All right, action.

15:58.491 --> 16:02.393
You know, I was watching that
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
<i>and I didn't realize</i>

16:02.395 --> 16:07.098
<i>that RuPaul is a man.</i>
<i> I've been wearing RuPaul's</i>
<i>Glamazon by Colorevolution</i>

16:07.100 --> 16:09.434
<i>for months.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> As a matter of fact, I have</i>

16:09.436 --> 16:11.636
<i>a special delivery on the way.</i>

16:11.638 --> 16:22.480
<i> And so what's gonna--when</i>
<i>does the mailman come in?</i>
<i>All right, I will yell</i>

16:22.482 --> 16:29.754
<i>"ding-dong," and whoever's house</i>
<i>it is is gonna say, "come in."</i>
<i>Okay, ready?</i>

16:29.756 --> 16:33.024
<i> Sure.</i>
<i> Sure.</i>
<i> Okay, and action.</i>

16:33.026 --> 16:36.761
<i> As a matter of fact, I have</i>
<i>a special delivery on the way.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

16:36.763 --> 16:47.271
<i> Ding-dong.</i>
<i>And then you say--</i>
<i> nice package.</i>

16:47.273 --> 16:51.509
<i> "Come in."</i>
<i> Come in.</i>
<i> Now, do you think I should be</i>

16:51.511 --> 16:54.979
<i>saying "come in,"</i>
<i>since he's delivering--</i>

16:54.981 --> 17:02.620
<i> we kind of nailed it.</i>
<i>Courtney, first time,</i>
<i>every time.</i>

17:02.622 --> 17:05.123
<i> Get the most kick with</i>

17:05.125 --> 17:07.692
<i>a sexy high-gloss lip shine.</i>

17:07.694 --> 17:12.497
<i> [Laughs]</i>

17:12.499 --> 17:17.101
<i> [Laughs]</i>

17:17.103 --> 17:20.838
<i>Well, look who's here.</i>
<i> Hi, there, Ru.</i>
<i>Hi, Michelle.</i>

17:20.840 --> 17:24.675
<i> Just like Jennifer coolidge</i>
<i>and Jennifer tilly.</i>
<i> Meets Courtney stodden, yes.</i>

17:24.677 --> 17:26.444
<i> I am a beautiful woman,</i>

17:26.446 --> 17:28.946
<i>and I feel pretty.</i>

17:28.948 --> 17:34.552
<i> And...Action.</i>
<i> Feel sassy with shadows</i>
<i>that accentuate</i>

17:34.554 --> 17:39.190
<i>your newly lifted lid.</i>
<i> Get the most kick</i>
<i>out of your collagen with</i>

17:39.192 --> 17:41.726
<i>a sexy high-gloss lip shine.</i>

17:41.728 --> 17:50.535
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>All right, and cut.</i>

17:50.537 --> 18:06.017
<i>Cut.</i>
<i>All right, we need to wrap yours</i>
<i>in a way where Jason can</i>

18:06.019 --> 18:12.023
<i>take it off easier.</i>
<i> Your head's gotten bigger</i>
<i>since last time you did this.</i>

18:12.025 --> 18:17.095
<i> Well, you're one to talk.</i>
<i> [Sighs]</i>
<i> Action.</i>

18:17.097 --> 18:19.597
<i> Wow.</i>
<i> Oh, she's gorgeous.</i>
<i> [Gasps]</i>

18:19.599 --> 18:23.401
<i> I wonder how they got</i>
<i>that beautiful.</i>
<i> It must be that Glamazon.</i>

18:23.403 --> 18:27.205
<i> Oh, yes.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i>Cut.</i>

18:27.207 --> 18:32.677
<i> Our ad is more</i>
<i>tongue-in-cheek but definitely</i>
<i>has the potential to sell makeup</i>

18:32.679 --> 18:34.846
<i>to some other crazy drag queens.</i>

18:34.848 --> 18:39.884
<i> Hello.</i>
<i> All right, these are</i>
<i>the working girls.</i>

18:39.886 --> 18:42.620
<i> Uh-huh.</i>
<i> I have no idea what's about</i>
<i>to happen.</i>

18:42.622 --> 18:43.454
<i>Trinity struggles with</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:45.156
<i>her delivery and confidence,</i>

18:45.158 --> 18:47.125
<i>so I'm fucking scared.</i>

18:47.127 --> 18:52.630
<i> Action.</i>
<i> I am the ceo of a major</i>
<i>corporation and the mother of</i>

18:52.632 --> 18:58.903
<i>two, and I use RuPaul's Glamazon</i>
<i>by Colorevolution.</i>
<i> Cut.</i>

18:58.905 --> 19:01.472
<i>Fantastic.</i>
<i>We're gonna do the same thing</i>
<i>with you, okay?</i>

19:01.474 --> 19:05.943
<i> I'm fucking petrified because</i>

19:05.945 --> 19:06.878
<i>Ru and Michelle will be</i>

19:06.880 --> 19:09.380
<i>directing me today, and I just</i>

19:09.382 --> 19:10.548
<i>don't seem to do well</i>

19:10.550 --> 19:11.215
<i>when they're sittin'</i>

19:11.217 --> 19:12.150
<i>right in front of me.</i>

19:12.152 --> 19:16.020
<i> Action.</i>
<i> I am a professional ho,</i>
<i>client from client,</i>

19:16.022 --> 19:19.190
<i>jumping out of car do's.</i>
<i> Jumping out of condos?</i>
<i> Car do's.</i>

19:19.192 --> 19:22.026
<i> Condos?</i>
<i> No, car doors.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

19:22.028 --> 19:24.128
<i>Car do's.</i>
<i> I think I'm trying to just</i>
<i>say it fast enough</i>

19:24.130 --> 19:27.598
<i>'cause it says 30 seconds.</i>
<i> All right, but we have to</i>
<i>understand you, baby.</i>

19:27.600 --> 19:31.435
<i> Remember, Trinity,</i>
<i>you know you can do this.</i>
<i>You got this, bitch.</i>

19:31.437 --> 19:34.605
<i> Bianca told me earlier,</i>
<i>"you're gonna be fine.</i>
<i>You're gonna be able to do this,</i>

19:34.607 --> 19:38.476
<i>you know."</i>
<i>I decided that I would</i>
<i>just chanel my inner Bianca</i>

19:38.478 --> 19:42.313
<i>and just blurt it all out</i>
<i>and just have fun with it,</i>
<i>'cause if not,</i>

19:42.315 --> 19:46.317
<i>Bianca gonna kill me.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>i am a professional ho,</i>

19:46.319 --> 19:50.454
<i>from client to client,</i>
<i>jumping out of car doors.</i>
<i>But, with RuPaul's Glamazon</i>

19:50.456 --> 19:56.694
<i>by Colorevolution--</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>Trinity did a really good job</i>

19:56.696 --> 20:00.431
<i>today.</i>
<i>Thank God.</i>
<i>I just hope that it's good</i>

20:00.433 --> 20:03.968
<i>enough to keep us safe.</i>
<i> That's a wrap, ladies.</i>

20:03.970 --> 20:10.708
<i> It's time to get</i>
<i>black and white.</i>

20:10.710 --> 20:11.943
<i> Today is elimination day,</i>

20:11.945 --> 20:13.411
<i>and our runway theme</i>

20:13.413 --> 20:15.213
<i>is black and white.</i>

20:15.215 --> 20:18.616
<i> What kind of runway looks</i>
<i>are y'all serving today?</i>
<i> I'm serving some Klaus nomi</i>

20:18.618 --> 20:21.953
<i>realness.</i>
<i>It's a very different look</i>
<i>for Courtney.</i>

20:21.955 --> 20:24.555
<i>Although I did notice</i>
<i>that joslyn--</i>
<i> with her light purple--</i>

20:24.557 --> 20:29.994
<i> oh, joslyn.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>joslyn and I are serving, like,</i>

20:29.996 --> 20:33.864
<i>the same...</i>
<i> Tuxedo menswear.</i>
<i> Tuxedo menswear look.</i>

20:33.866 --> 20:38.502
<i> So if you two both landed</i>
<i>in the bottom two performing</i>
<i>against each other</i>

20:38.504 --> 20:41.305
<i>in similar outfits...</i>
<i>[Gasps]</i>
<i>oh, my.</i>

20:41.307 --> 20:45.076
<i> Joslyn would go home.</i>
<i>[Dramatic gong]</i>
<i> 'cause she's a second-rate</i>

20:45.078 --> 20:48.546
<i>Courtney, yeah.</i>
<i> I think it was low-rent.</i>
<i> Shady.</i>

20:48.548 --> 20:49.880
<i> It's clear that Courtney does</i>

20:49.882 --> 20:52.550
<i>not see me at the same level</i>

20:52.552 --> 20:53.351
<i>as her.</i>

20:53.353 --> 20:58.589
<i>This is somebody that I idolize,</i>
<i>and I'm a little disappointed.</i>
<i> On that note...</i>

20:58.591 --> 21:02.860
<i> Let's get pretty then, okay?</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> Come on, y'all.</i>

21:02.862 --> 21:05.863
<i> What are you doing?</i>
<i> My eyebrows.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

21:05.865 --> 21:09.967
<i> What are you doing?</i>
<i> Why you doing it</i>
<i>all in my hair-rea?</i>

21:09.969 --> 21:13.104
<i> Um--</i>
<i> I'm just kidding.</i>
<i>It's all right.</i>

21:13.106 --> 21:15.740
<i> I mean,</i>
<i>i know it's all right.</i>
<i> Do you think they paired us</i>

21:15.742 --> 21:19.644
<i>up 'cause they were kinda like,</i>
<i>"oh, Darienne, you got a big</i>
<i>body, and Ben's got a big head."</i>

21:19.646 --> 21:22.747
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> You love to say that.</i>
<i>I don't know if that's</i>

21:22.749 --> 21:25.783
<i>really true.</i>
<i> No, it's just because you</i>
<i>made that comment, like, after--</i>

21:25.785 --> 21:28.319
<i>about the whole winning twice,</i>
<i>and I was just like,</i>
<i>"oh, okay."</i>

21:28.321 --> 21:31.422
<i> She told me she hated you.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

21:31.424 --> 21:32.390
<i> I really feel some</i>

21:32.392 --> 21:34.225
<i>psychic energy between de LA</i>

21:34.227 --> 21:34.892
<i>and Darienne.</i>

21:34.894 --> 21:39.130
<i>I don't know what's going on,</i>
<i>but I feel like there's some</i>
<i>type of tension that you can cut</i>

21:39.132 --> 21:44.535
<i>with a cheese knife.</i>
<i> How are you doing, girl-lina?</i>
<i> I feel good.</i>

21:44.537 --> 21:47.738
<i>I think we worked well together.</i>
<i> We did work well together.</i>
<i>We didn't kill each other.</i>

21:47.740 --> 21:50.041
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> So that was good.</i>
<i>You know we didn't see</i>

21:50.043 --> 21:52.443
<i>eye-to-eye to begin with.</i>
<i> 'Cause I didn't know you.</i>
<i> Right.</i>

21:52.445 --> 21:55.479
<i> I just felt like your purpose</i>
<i>here was just to come here</i>
<i>and be evil and mean.</i>

21:55.481 --> 21:59.016
<i> I apologize if I ever</i>
<i>came across that way.</i>

21:59.018 --> 22:00.117
<i>I was angry with her because</i>

22:00.119 --> 22:01.986
<i>her work ethic and her attitude</i>

22:01.988 --> 22:03.354
<i>wasn't the same as mine, which</i>

22:03.356 --> 22:04.922
<i>i learned you can still work</i>

22:04.924 --> 22:06.257
<i>with people if they come from</i>

22:06.259 --> 22:07.291
<i>a different place.</i>

22:07.293 --> 22:08.459
<i>It's not only my way</i>

22:08.461 --> 22:09.126
<i>or the highway.</i>

22:09.128 --> 22:14.198
<i>I'm learning patience, bitch.</i>
<i> I'm also obviously learning</i>
<i>that I have ways I guess I need</i>

22:14.200 --> 22:16.834
<i>to just work on.</i>
<i> I really think Trinity has</i>
<i>come a long way,</i>

<i> Both: Bam.</i>

<i> That ass is so perfect.</i>

27:02.088 --> 27:03.087
<i>and fabric.</i>

27:03.089 --> 27:03.754

<i> Now sissy that walk </i>

27:09.362 --> 27:15.833
<i>First up, Bianca Del Rio</i>
<i>and Trinity K. Bonet</i>
<i>targeting the working girl.</i>

27:15.835 --> 27:21.405
<i>Let's take a look.</i>
<i> I'm the ceo of a major</i>
<i>corporation and the mother of</i>

27:21.407 --> 27:26.443
<i>two, so in order to keep</i>
<i>my sickening appearance,</i>
<i>i use RuPaul's Glamazon</i>

27:26.445 --> 27:33.417
<i>by Colorevolution.</i>
<i>I am so much finer with</i>
<i>this glamorous liquid liner.</i>

27:33.419 --> 27:37.554
<i> I am a professional ho,</i>
<i>from client to client,</i>
<i>jumping out of car doors.</i>

27:37.556 --> 27:42.726
<i>Can't even keep my lipstick on.</i>
<i>But with RuPaul's Glamazon</i>
<i>by Colorevolution...</i>

27:42.728 --> 27:46.764
<i>Bam!</i>
<i>With this gloss, I am the boss.</i>
<i> So whether you're</i>

27:46.766 --> 27:51.435
<i>a corporate ceo--</i>
<i> or a professional ho.</i>
<i> Both: You deserve</i>

27:51.437 --> 27:57.574
<i>a glamorous glow.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> now, get back to work, y'all.</i>

27:57.576 --> 28:00.544
<i> Okay.</i>
<i>[Car horn honks]</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

28:00.546 --> 28:05.416
<i>[Applause]</i>
<i>So how was it working together?</i>
<i> My gay mother passed away,</i>

28:05.418 --> 28:09.687
<i>like, two years ago,</i>
<i>and her name was Bianca, and she</i>
<i>reminds me so much of my mother.</i>

28:09.689 --> 28:12.189
<i>Like, just shut up</i>
<i>and do what I say.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

28:12.191 --> 28:14.425
<i> And she just told me,</i>
<i>just embrace all</i>
<i>the opportunities I have.</i>

28:14.427 --> 28:19.563
<i>Have fun with it.</i>
<i> Well, the runway--I think you</i>
<i>are both exquisite,</i>

28:19.565 --> 28:23.734
<i>and the infomercial was funny.</i>
<i>I thought your acting</i>
<i>was really good.</i>

28:23.736 --> 28:28.372
<i> Well, Trinity, to me, missed</i>
<i>the boat in a perfect joke</i>
<i>for you because you have</i>

28:28.374 --> 28:30.507
<i>lip gloss on.</i>
<i>You were selling</i>
<i>working girls, right?</i>

28:30.509 --> 28:32.576
<i> Right, right.</i>
<i> Don't you want to know</i>
<i>it's gonna stay on after</i>

28:32.578 --> 28:35.279
<i>you do your stuff?</i>
<i> Well, that's what she said.</i>
<i> She didn't</i> <i>say</i> it say it.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.549
She said jumping
from car to car--
I don't know what she's doing

28:38.551 --> 28:41.852
in car--this could be this.
She has her lipstick on
'cause she's a professional ho.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.488
So the lipstick should
stay on!
She said it lasts

28:44.490 --> 28:47.791
through all that.
I want to know, did it
stay on through the trick

28:47.793 --> 28:50.494
or not?
Yes!
Well, I didn't get that.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.696
[Laughs]
All right then.
You two must know each other.

28:52.698 --> 28:55.365
Yes.
You think?
[Laughter]

28:55.367 --> 29:00.304
All right, next up,
Laganja Estranja
and Adore Delano

29:00.306 --> 29:06.143
targeting mean teen girls.
Let's take a look.
We used to think we had all

29:06.145 --> 29:12.116
the makeup that money could buy.
But now, thanks to RuPaul's
Glamazon by Colorevolution,

29:12.118 --> 29:18.055
our faces stand out amongst the
trolls in our high school halls.
I know all the losers sitting

29:18.057 --> 29:22.960
alone at lunch right now are
feeling so much safer 'cause
we're too busy painting our own

29:22.962 --> 29:27.131
faces instead of theirs--
with this long-lasting mascara,
of course.

29:27.133 --> 29:31.769
Sorry, Stacy, but your
boyfriend is now mine.
He just can't resist this

29:31.771 --> 29:36.140
vitamin-infused lip gloss.
Because whoever said beauty
was on the inside...

29:36.142 --> 29:40.744
Is ugly.
[Laughter]
[Applause]

29:40.746 --> 29:46.416
I think you sold it.
It was shockingly irreverent
but aspirational.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.319
I want to buy the product,
and that's the most
important thing.

29:49.321 --> 29:54.324
I think your costume--
it's a little tacky looking.
Your hair is uneven.

29:54.326 --> 29:58.929
It's flopping, and the crotch
is a little low for me.
I absolutely love

29:58.931 --> 30:01.165
the way you look, Adore.
Yay.
Your waist is cinched.

30:01.167 --> 30:04.835
You have legs.
You're not cutting them off.
Let's, like, savor this moment.

30:04.837 --> 30:09.206
I'm a real drag queen.
Yes.
[Laughs]

30:09.208 --> 30:11.375
Not my favorite ad.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.177
I have no idea who you are.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.546
Am I on another show?

30:15.548 --> 30:17.614
[Laughs]

30:17.616 --> 30:25.522
[Laughs]
Next up, Ben de LA creme
and Darienne Lake

30:25.524 --> 30:32.062
targeting cougars.
[Roars]
The signs of age--cosmetic

30:32.064 --> 30:37.234
surgery can help you rebuild
your foundation.
But no renovation is complete

30:37.236 --> 30:43.440
without a fresh coat of paint.
Shh, your secret is safe
with RuPaul's Glamazon

30:43.442 --> 30:48.045
by Colorevolution.
Feel sassy with shadows
that accentuate

30:48.047 --> 30:53.617
that newly lifted lid.
Get the most kick
out of your collagen with

30:53.619 --> 31:01.425
a high-gloss lip shine.
Blush helps to accentuate
cheekbones and distract

31:01.427 --> 31:08.332
from unsightly scars.
Your body is a temple.
Now,"pray," cougar, "pray."

31:08.334 --> 31:14.004
[Applause]
I feel like it's more of
a p.S.A. For plastic surgery.

31:14.006 --> 31:18.208
I thought it was about either
surgery or drugs.
[Laughs]

31:18.210 --> 31:23.914
I thought you were
definitely stoned.
[Laughter]

31:23.916 --> 31:29.353
Ben de LA, my issue is I feel
like every time we're hiding
behind another costume.

31:29.355 --> 31:35.525
I have no idea who you are,
and I want to get to know more
of who you are as a person.

31:35.527 --> 31:41.365
Next up, Courtney Act
and Joslyn Fox targeting
stay-at-home hot mamas.

31:41.367 --> 31:45.335
Let's take a look.
I was watching that
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

31:45.337 --> 31:49.973
<i>and I didn't realize that</i>
<i>that RuPaul is a man.</i>
<i> Oh, you stupid bitch,</i>

31:49.975 --> 31:53.277
<i>of course RuPaul is a man.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>and I've been wearing RuPaul's</i>

31:53.279 --> 31:56.146
<i>Glamazon by Colorevolution</i>
<i>for months.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

31:56.148 --> 31:59.416
<i> As a matter of fact, I have</i>
<i>a special delivery on the way.</i>
<i>[Ding-dong]</i>

31:59.418 --> 32:04.087
<i> Come in.</i>
<i>Nice package.</i>
<i> And the makeup doesn't look</i>

32:04.089 --> 32:07.991
<i>too bad either.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>If it can make a man like RuPaul</i>

32:07.993 --> 32:12.162
<i>look like a Glamazon--</i>
<i> both: Imagine what it can do</i>
<i>for a stay-at-home mom</i>

32:12.164 --> 32:17.634
<i>like you...Or us.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

32:17.636 --> 32:22.973
<i>[Applause]</i>
<i> What was it like</i>
<i>working together?</i>

32:22.975 --> 32:25.275
<i> We've got, like,</i>
<i>a little sister vibe going.</i>
<i>She's the little sister.</i>

32:25.277 --> 32:28.779
<i> I'm the low-rent version</i>
<i>of Courtney, so she says.</i>
<i> I may have used</i>

32:28.781 --> 32:34.518
<i>that term once.</i>
<i> You didn't know that Glamazon</i>
<i>by Colorevolution was makeup</i>

32:34.520 --> 32:39.156
<i>until the end.</i>
<i> But, Courtney, tonight</i>
<i>i think this Klaus nomi cocktail</i>

32:39.158 --> 32:45.929
<i>waitress look is amazing.</i>
<i>It's gorgeous.</i>
<i> Joslyn, are you serious?</i>

32:45.931 --> 32:49.533
<i>You just wore this in blue,</i>
<i>and we just told you</i>
<i>there was so much going on,</i>

32:49.535 --> 32:54.571
<i>and now you wore it again.</i>
<i>When you turn around,</i>
<i>the hairline--it's boy.</i>

32:54.573 --> 32:58.875
<i> I couldn't give a crap</i>
<i>about the hair.</i>
<i>I was mesmerized by the ass.</i>

32:58.877 --> 33:03.880
<i> All right, ladies, while you</i>
<i>unwind in the untucked lounge,</i>
<i>the judges and I will</i>

33:03.882 --> 33:10.020
<i>deliberate.</i>
<i>All right, just between us</i>
<i>ad executives, what'd you think?</i>

33:10.022 --> 33:15.192
<i>Let's start with Laganja</i>
<i>Estranja and Adore Delano.</i>
<i> I think as a group</i>

33:15.194 --> 33:19.629
<i>Laganja and Adore had</i>
<i>the best ad for me.</i>
<i>I really thought it was funny.</i>

33:19.631 --> 33:24.201
<i>They sold the makeup product.</i>
<i> While being bullies.</i>
<i> But that was their character,</i>

33:24.203 --> 33:27.404
<i>Michelle.</i>
<i> But--yeah, it's pushed so far</i>
<i>that it's funny.</i>

33:27.406 --> 33:31.975
<i> But with that said, I think</i>
<i>Adore was the stronger one of</i>
<i>the two and pulled Laganja</i>

33:31.977 --> 33:35.612
<i>through.</i>
<i> All right, next up,</i>
<i>Bianca Del Rio</i>

33:35.614 --> 33:40.784
<i>and Trinity K. Bonet-nay.</i>
<i> I think on the runway,</i>
<i>they were the most beautiful,</i>

33:40.786 --> 33:45.422
<i>the best.</i>
<i> As far as the infomercial</i>
<i>goes, they got the job done.</i>

33:45.424 --> 33:48.125
<i>I feel like we saw a side of</i>
<i>Trinity we haven't been able</i>
<i>to see.</i>

33:48.127 --> 33:52.229
<i>We got to see Trinity speaking</i>
<i>up and really enjoying it,</i>
<i>and that was refreshing.</i>

33:52.231 --> 33:58.068
<i> Not my favorite ad.</i>
<i>The before and afters--it wasn't</i>
<i>that big of a transformation</i>

33:58.070 --> 34:00.070
<i>for me.</i>
<i> I didn't even know</i>
<i>until this moment.</i>

34:00.072 --> 34:03.507
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> All right, let's move on.</i>
<i>Ben de LA creme</i>

34:03.509 --> 34:09.946
<i>and Darienne Lake.</i>
<i> Well, the commercial--I mean,</i>
<i>it was a very strange attack</i>

34:09.948 --> 34:12.449
<i>on the product.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> very strange attack on the--</i>

34:12.451 --> 34:16.319
<i> in fact, I didn't know what</i>
<i>the product was, you know?</i>
<i> It was a butchering.</i>

34:16.321 --> 34:18.422
<i> I didn't know they were</i>
<i>selling makeup.</i>
<i>I felt like it was</i>

34:18.424 --> 34:21.958
<i>all about the surgery.</i>
<i>The faces they were pulling</i>
<i>were not attractive at all.</i>

34:21.960 --> 34:25.128
<i>We love those faces,</i>
<i>but not when you're trying</i>
<i>to sell cosmetics.</i>

34:25.130 --> 34:31.068
<i> Tonight on the runway, I did</i>
<i>not fancy Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i>The hair looked like a penis</i>

34:31.070 --> 34:35.105
<i>wrapped in a bandage.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>it was very weird.</i>

34:35.107 --> 34:39.009
<i> And I do not know</i>
<i>who de LA is at all</i>
<i>except a costume queen.</i>

34:39.011 --> 34:43.380
<i>I feel like to be America's next</i>
<i>drag superstar, we need to know</i>
<i>that that person is underneath</i>

34:43.382 --> 34:47.818
<i>all of that.</i>
<i> Let's talk about Courtney Act</i>
<i>and Joslyn Fox.</i>

34:47.820 --> 34:51.721
<i> Courtney was really fun on</i>
<i>the runway tonight.</i>
<i>I love the look she was giving.</i>

34:51.723 --> 34:55.225
<i> Joslyn--I can't even</i>
<i>believe--</i>
<i> but I think you can</i>

34:55.227 --> 34:57.360
<i>believe she would wear that.</i>
<i> Well, that's true.</i>
<i>That's true.</i>

34:57.362 --> 34:59.596
<i> Aren't you from South</i>
<i>plainfield, New Jersey?</i>
<i> Holla.</i>

34:59.598 --> 35:03.366
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> The point, is you just wore</i>
<i>what you wore last week, after</i>

35:03.368 --> 35:07.204
<i>we so harshly critiqued you,</i>
<i>in another color?</i>
<i>And then put your boy hair on?</i>

35:07.206 --> 35:12.075
<i> I don't know why when people</i>
<i>get characters like stay-at-home</i>
<i>mom, that automatically means</i>

35:12.077 --> 35:14.678
<i>that they have to be</i>
<i>very matronly.</i>
<i> I thought they looked</i>

35:14.680 --> 35:17.414
<i>stunning.</i>
<i> No, they didn't.</i>
<i> They didn't overdo it.</i>

35:17.416 --> 35:20.350
<i> I thought Courtney was so,</i>
<i>like, dumbed down.</i>
<i> She was drab.</i>

35:20.352 --> 35:22.686
<i> I thought they looked</i>
<i>stunning.</i>
<i> Well, she does this</i>

35:22.688 --> 35:24.721
<i>realness thing.</i>
<i>That's what she was doing</i>
<i>in the commercial.</i>

35:24.723 --> 35:26.723
<i> Right.</i>
<i> I don't want real.</i>
<i>I want a drag queen.</i>

35:26.725 --> 35:30.360
<i> Okay, but that wasn't</i>
<i>their commercial.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

35:30.362 --> 35:35.398
<i> Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,</i>
<i>am I on another show?</i>
<i> Now, leah, you like this ad.</i>

35:35.400 --> 35:38.902
<i>Tell us why.</i>
<i> I actually didn't.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

35:38.904 --> 35:43.173
<i>[RuPaul claps twice]</i>
<i> Silence.</i>
<i>I've made my decision.</i>

35:43.175 --> 35:49.613
<i>Bring back my glamazons.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

35:49.615 --> 35:58.788
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
<i>I've made some decisions.</i>

35:58.790 --> 36:08.131
<i>Adore and Laganja, this week</i>
<i>you mean girls ruled the school.</i>
<i>Condragulations, you're the</i>

36:08.133 --> 36:12.836
<i>winner of this week's challenge.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>
<i> oh, my God, I'm shocked.</i>

36:12.838 --> 36:16.506
<i> So am I.</i>
<i>[Record scratches]</i>
<i> oh.</i>

36:16.508 --> 36:21.278
<i>Push her, please, for me.</i>
<i> Such a nasty bitch.</i>
<i> You'll each receive</i>

36:21.280 --> 36:27.083
<i>a sickening supply of products</i>
<i>from lather, clean skin</i>
<i>for radiant life.</i>

36:27.085 --> 36:30.387
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> I love it.</i>
<i> You may step to the back</i>

36:30.389 --> 36:36.693
<i>of the stage.</i>
<i>Bianca Del Rio,</i>
<i>Trinity K. Bonet,</i>

36:36.695 --> 36:42.933
<i>you're safe.</i>
<i>Ben de LA creme,</i>
<i>Darienne Lake,</i>

36:42.935 --> 36:50.974
<i>your kooky cougars got lost</i>
<i>in the lipstick jungle.</i>
<i>Courtney Act, Joslyn Fox,</i>

36:50.976 --> 36:58.782
<i>your hot mommas didn't bring it</i>
<i>home to daddy.</i>
<i>Courtney Act, Joslyn Fox,</i>

36:58.784 --> 37:00.850
<i>you're safe.</i>

37:00.852 --> 37:09.659
<i>Ben de LA creme, Darienne Lake,</i>
<i>I'm sorry, my dears,</i>
<i>but you are up for elimination.</i>

37:09.661 --> 37:11.528
<i> I've been on the top so much</i>

37:11.530 --> 37:13.396
<i>in this competition, I can't</i>

37:13.398 --> 37:14.931
<i>believe that this might be</i>

37:14.933 --> 37:16.199
<i>my last night here.</i>

37:16.201 --> 37:24.174
<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>
<i>Ladies, this is your last chance</i>
<i>to impress me and save yourself</i>

37:24.176 --> 37:30.814
<i>from elimination.</i>
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>for you to lip-synch</i>

37:30.816 --> 37:39.656
<i>[echoing] For your life.</i>
<i>Good luck,</i>
<i>and don't fuck it up.</i>

37:39.658 --> 37:46.196
<i> The common road </i>

37:46.198 --> 37:48.465
<i> seems just like a dream </i>

37:48.467 --> 37:56.640
<i> it's a mystery to me </i>
<i> fills me within </i>
<i> when we're together </i>

37:56.642 --> 38:00.577
<i> oh, baby, can't you see </i>
<i> I </i>

38:00.579 --> 38:03.146
<i> miss Darienne is turning it,</i>

38:03.148 --> 38:03.813
<i>'cause you know</i>

38:03.815 --> 38:04.748
<i>good-God-damn-well</i>

38:04.750 --> 38:06.216
<i>miss Darienne had this song</i>

38:06.218 --> 38:08.351
<i>on cassette when it came out.</i>

38:08.353 --> 38:12.355
<i>She knows the words.</i>
<i>She knows the movement.</i>
<i>I'm banking on that bitch.</i>

38:12.357 --> 38:15.959
<i> I'm gonna take you </i>
<i> in my arms </i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

38:15.961 --> 38:23.800
<i> You're taking me </i>
<i> to the point of no return </i>
<i> oh, oh, oh </i>

38:23.802 --> 38:31.775
<i> it took so long </i>
<i> well, I treasure now </i>
<i> the love you gave to me </i>

38:31.777 --> 38:38.281
<i> I </i>
<i> I'd like to feel the passion </i>
<i> to the point of no return </i>

<i> de LA is just catching every</i>

38:39.484 --> 38:41.418
<i>beat and walking back and forth.</i>

38:41.420 --> 38:45.255
<i>She's peeling out of her clothes</i>
<i>and feeling her ladylike ways...</i>
<i> I'm gonna take you </i>

<i> in my arms </i>

<i>Darienne Lake,</i>
<i>shante, you stay.</i>

<i>You may join the other girls.</i>

39:47.919 --> 39:57.994
<i>Ben de LA creme, I know this</i>
<i>didn't turn out the way you had</i>
<i>planned, but I hope it makes you</i>

39:57.996 --> 40:04.934
<i>an even fiercer queen,</i>
<i>because your time here...</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

<i>Can I get a amen in here?</i>
<i> All: Amen.</i>

<i> All right,</i>
<i>now let the music play.</i>
<i>[Electronic music]</i>
