I was taken from prison...

00:04.880 --> 00:08.543
...and forced to become an assassin
for a secret unit of the government:

00:09.051 --> 00:13.090
Black-ops program called Division
that has now gone rogue.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.255
They destroyed my identity
and they destroyed the man / loved.

and now the man that trained me...

00:18.977 --> 00:21.263
...someone I trusted, is hunting me.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.852
What Division doesn't know
is that I have a partner on the inside:

00:29.071 --> 00:31.813
...who I've trained in secret
to resist their control.

apart, one mission at a time.

before the end will be my name.

& PHONE RINGS]

13:18.464 --> 13:20.329
-Hello?
MAN: Hey, it's me.

13:20.508 --> 13:24.922
-How'd it go with your editor?
-Um, it was good. I have the money.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.587
Well, what is it? Is it cash, check?

13:27.765 --> 13:29.175
It's check.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.012
I just need to know
who to write it out to.

13:32.228 --> 13:36.346
I want you to take a picture of the check
and upload it to my Flickr account.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.436
This is Malia Watson, Jill's editor.
What is on this video...

13:39.610 --> 13:41.475
...and why would I pay you
$50,000...

13:41.654 --> 13:44.396
...for something that's been mocked up
on your desktop?

13:44.574 --> 13:48.408
-You'll have to see it for yourself.
-Honey, I don't have time for games.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.910
-Betterluck with The Enquirer. Be well.
-Wait.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.160
You have to understand,
I never meant to see this.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.700
I was hiking off the trail
when I heard the crash.

13:56.878 --> 14:01.212
And I ran over and when I got there,
it was just wreckage.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.622
You know, everywhere.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.292
And I heard these helicopters,
so I thought it was search-and—rescue.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.132
These so-called black helicopters?

14:08.306 --> 14:10.922
Yeah. The guys rappelled out of them
like commandos.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.965
But instead of looking for survivors...

14:13.144 --> 14:15.851
...they started hauling these huge bags
out of the wreck.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.683
The bags were packed with cocaine.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.018
Like the whole plane
was packed with coke...

14:20.193 --> 14:22.058
...and these guys were grabbing it up.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.856
How do you know it was cocaine?

14:25.031 --> 14:28.615
It was either that or someone
was about to bake a really big cake.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.653
We have the money, you have the video.
Where do you wanna meet for the trade?

14:32.830 --> 14:35.287
The quad at North Virginia State.
Okay?

14:35.458 --> 14:36.618
Tomorrow, 10 am.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.335
Was that really necessary?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.393
Great spot to hide from a trace.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.819
Where do you want us to start?

15:11.786 --> 15:15.699
Percy told me what's going on
and I have to agree.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.539
There's something off with your story.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.200
I didn't do anything.
Why don't you guys believe me?

15:21.838 --> 15:24.170
I believe that you believe that,
Birkhoff.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.374
Great, psychobabble. How much
are you charging for this session?

15:28.553 --> 15:31.966
I only want you to open up to me.
You can tell me anything.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.296
No,no,no.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.807
You are trying to get me to admit
to something that I didn't do.

15:36.978 --> 15:40.061
What did you and Nikita talk about
when she captured you?

15:40.231 --> 15:42.688
We've been over this
a thousand times.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.810
She told me she wanted
to burn down Division.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.072
I told her she was insane.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.576
And you and Nikita were comrades
when she served here.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.408
Did you ever have feelings for her?

15:58.583 --> 15:59.618
You know what?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.750
I'm getting a feeling right now
like I was kidnapped...

16:02.920 --> 16:05.252
...and now I'm being framed
for giving her intel.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.335
Birkhoff, I'm not holding it
against you.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.342
If you have an emotional connection
to Nikita, it's natural.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.130
Coworkers often develop physical and
emotional attractions for one another.

16:15.766 --> 16:20.726
She was a recruit. A super hot one,
yeah, but I know the rules.

16:20.897 --> 16:24.230
-Look, but don't touch.
-She's not a recruit anymore.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.640
Whose fault is that?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.565
Ever since she held you hostage...

16:30.740 --> 16:34.528
...Nikita has had access
to highly confidential information.

16:41.918 --> 16:46.332
You see, you're the one
who screwed the pooch, Amanda.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.793
You were supposed to mold her
into this perfect, obedient agent.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.879
But the second girlfriend got a chance
to split, she took it.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.097
-Where you going?
-Martin.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.682
Oh.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.889
-Take him to Medical.
-Oh, come on.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.979
I want to run an fMRI brain scan
for lie detection.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.438
I'm not lying.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.156
-Okay. All right.
-Full body cavity search as well.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.442
That is overkill, Amanda. Ow, owl

17:17.620 --> 17:19.576
Amanda!

17:20.623 --> 17:23.581
Tell me you found the video.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.288
We're still looking for the source.

17:27.338 --> 17:31.331
I'd like your permission to enlist some
of the recruits to help with the trace.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.842
We've emptied the reporter's apartment,
her public storage locker.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.343
Brought everything here.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.506
I get it. Too much material
to sift through on the clock.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.424
Fine. Do it.

17:41.602 --> 17:45.470
I also would like to give them
the target's full profile.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.013
Absolutely not.

17:47.191 --> 17:51.434
Like you said, we're on the clock.
Redacting intel will only slow us down.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.820
If we give them a full profile,
it will invariably prompt...

17:54.991 --> 17:58.028
...the inane moral debate
about the target being a good person.

17:58.202 --> 18:01.660
Last thing we need is another recruit
to discover their inner Nikita.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.664
Tell them it's a training exercise.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.669
All right, listen up.
We're running a training exercise.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.802
Three-man units.
This will be a competition.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.714
Team leaders, pick your people.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.553
Jaden. Alex.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.313
What are you doing?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.096
I'm trying to save your life.
Both of yours.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.358
You guys were given an ultimatum
that came from Operations.

18:32.528 --> 18:36.146
Show visible improvement
within two weeks or get cancelled.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.650
That was a week ago.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.399
How do you think you're doing?

18:40.578 --> 18:43.411
If anyone else fails this test,
they'll get meal penalty...

18:43.581 --> 18:45.242
...or maybe solitary at the worst.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.908
If either of you fail,
you may not be coming back.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.873
MICHAEL:
Good evening.

18:53.049 --> 18:57.133
This exercise is designed
to test your tracking skills.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.090
You'll examine evidence
from the home of a terrorist...

19:00.264 --> 19:02.550
...who was planning to meet
a munitions expert.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.850
Your task is to uncover the identity
of the munitions expert...

19:10.024 --> 19:12.185
...and where the meet was going
to take place.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.519
Our agents were able to do this
in 12 hours.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.984
Let's see if you can do better.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.246
Fifteen minutes, okay?
Then we're back in the car.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.203
Got 90 miles to go
and we gotta take back roads.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.916
No more nervous appetite?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.420
I keep seeing Jeremy's face.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.920
He was staring right at me when....

19:42.098 --> 19:44.760
You didn't kill him, Jill. They did.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.097
And why? For what? For money?

19:48.270 --> 19:51.478
Yeah. For a lot of money.
Think about it, okay?

19:51.649 --> 19:55.562
Henry Samson is using
passenger planes to smuggle drugs.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.439
Probably to keep from going under
like all the other airline companies.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.490
A real-life story of the year.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.613
Jeremy would have loved this.

20:05.788 --> 20:10.157
When we get this video, you're gonna
make sure your article gets published.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.950
Yeah, if we get the video.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.586
Those guys coming after us
aren't airline security.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.839
They're the commando guys
from the crash site.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.966
Who are they?

20:22.138 --> 20:25.255
Oh, come on.
You said before I was on the right track.

20:25.474 --> 20:29.433
Some kind of government black-ops unit?
Maybe even mercenaries?

20:29.603 --> 20:31.855
You need to stick with
what you can prove.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.434
If this video is
all it's cracked up to be...

20:34.608 --> 20:37.600
...you get to prove that
a Fortune 500 CEO is smuggling drugs.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.942
You will never be able to prove
who the guys were in the helicopters.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.697
-Why?
-They don't have decals...

20:43.868 --> 20:45.779
...on their vehicles or their clothing.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.112
There's no record that they exist.
No documentation, no evidence.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.703
What about you?
You were part of them. You're evidence.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.583
I don't exist either.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.292
Why won't you tell me what you know?
Why are you protecting them?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.168
I'm protecting you, Jill.

21:01.135 --> 21:05.003
Think if I could go to the press to take
them down, I wouldn't have done it?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.764
You won't be the first reporter
I've seen them kill.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.425
Yeah, well, I won't let Jeremy
die for nothing.

21:11.604 --> 21:16.769
I have to tell the whole story, Nikita.
I owe him at least that much.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.226
We gotta go. Now.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.941
Get up, put your head down,
follow me.

Excuse me, miss.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.704
NIKITA:
Come on.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.883
Go. We gotta lose the car.
They're gonna know where we are.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.295
-But you just knocked them out.
-I'm not talking about the cops.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.937
We got a hit on Nikita, 90 miles
outside of Blacksburg, off Highway 81.

22:01.362 --> 22:04.229
-Does she have the reporter?
-Two highway patrol officers...

22:04.406 --> 22:07.273
...recognized Morelli from the BOLO.
Nikita slipped the net.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.612
-Amateurs.
-Alpha Team's en route to Virginia.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.403
-I'm gonna chopper there.
-You'|l wanna see this first.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.118
We found how she breached us.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.746
It's you?

22:19.421 --> 22:21.912
I'm not the mole, genius.
It's my molar.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.207
Second bicuspid, actually.
Lower left.

22:24.385 --> 22:27.092
I had Medical run an fMRI on Birkhoff.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.130
Imagine my surprise when it showed
a wireless transmitter...

22:30.307 --> 22:31.513
...embedded in his tooth.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.342
Nikita must have planted it
when he was passed out.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.603
-Possib|y.
-Possib|y? I think I'd remember that.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.138
AMANDA:
He passed the lie detection.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.524
She had to remove the cap
in order to insert the bug.

22:42.695 --> 22:46.028
-You must've felt that afterwards.
-Oh, I felt it.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.110
My whole face was sore for a week
after she got done with me.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.617
Why are you smiling?

22:51.787 --> 22:54.403
Look, just get it out of there.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.034
Get what out of where?

23:04.258 --> 23:07.842
I am totally sorry about that whole
"you're bad at yourjob" thing.

23:08.012 --> 23:11.300
And I completely take it back.
It was....

23:12.016 --> 23:13.051
Please.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.134
Drugs, please.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.890
Describe him again.

23:23.068 --> 23:28.859
Um.... Early 203, African American,
kind of hipster-cute.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.364
Hipster-cute?

23:30.534 --> 23:34.402
Yeah, you know, an ironic t-shirt
kind of guy with the big jeans...

23:34.580 --> 23:37.287
-...that hangs out in the coffee shops--
-Yeah, I get it.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.289
Maybe we got the location wrong.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.496
Maybe he's waiting for us
somewhere else...

23:41.670 --> 23:44.503
...and can't call us
because you stomped on my phone.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.210
We're at the right place.
He's not gonna show up.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.672
-Probably saw the news.
-What news?

23:50.846 --> 23:53.132
That you're wanted for murder.
He's paranoid.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.174
Okay, what do we do now?
I mean, we're screwed.

23:56.810 --> 24:00.223
We're gonna track him down ourselves.
Come on.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.611
These notebooks are just
conspiracy theory crap.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.942
What are we supposed to be
looking for anyway?

24:11.116 --> 24:15.155
Behavioral patterns, motives,
potential targets.

24:15.329 --> 24:18.492
There's a bunch of stuff
on a plane crash. Maybe she caused it.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.165
They said the terrorist was targeting
a government facility, not a plane.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.952
Like the Pentagon?
A plane crashed into that.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.622
Yeah, there's a conspiracy theory
on that in here too.

24:29.385 --> 24:32.969
-Why are the names blacked out?
-They don't wanna make it easy on us.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.469
How do you know it's a she?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.096
-What?
-The terrorist.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.972
What makes you think it's a woman?

24:39.228 --> 24:44.018
Smell.
Grapefruit-and—vaniIla-scented candles.

24:45.275 --> 24:49.860
All right, show-off. I'll see your scented
candles and I'll raise you this.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.358
Handwritten note.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.398
"Video on A.T., Stony Creek."

24:54.576 --> 24:57.568
Maybe AT. is the initials
of the munitions expert.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.282
Stony Creek's in Virginia.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.947
The plane crash was in Virginia.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.246
A.T. could be Appalachian Trail.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.335
Notbad.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.581
Anything not tied to Virginia
moves off the table.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.919
Let's get a map.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.585
NIKITA: Where's the movie theater
you first met him at?

25:14.763 --> 25:15.843
JILL:
Right here.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.303
He asked you to meet at two different
locations near the university.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.513
He was hiking the day of the crash,
which was a Wednesday.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.395
He's not a nine-to-fiver,
he's a college student.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.147
One without a set of wheels.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.308
Both locations are on this bus route.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.977
I found three sporting goods stores
along that line.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.316
Right.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.607
Wait, why do we care about
sporting goods all of a sudden?

25:36.785 --> 25:38.070
Our student's a hiker.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.074
An ambitious one, if he got up
to where the crash happened.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.655
That's way off trail.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.791
