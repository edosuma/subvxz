00:03.103 --> 00:04.636
Look what someone
left in our mailbox... again.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.171
Wait, that's like
our fifth one, isn't it?

00:06.173 --> 00:07.606
It's getting
kind of creepy.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.475
Oh, relax... it's probably
just from victor,

00:09.477 --> 00:11.010
That flower-delivery guy
I dated.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.678
Who's victor?
We never heard about him.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.481
Oh, because I knew you'd never
let me go out with an ex-con.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.149
Hey, maybe it's dylan
trying to win you back.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.350
Mm.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.352
So, victor...
It's a closed door?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.187
Maybe it's not a guy
who's in love with Haley.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.622
Oh, thank you.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.457
Maybe it's a guy
who's obsessed with Haley

00:25.459 --> 00:26.792
And is getting plastic surgery
to look like her

00:26.794 --> 00:28.127
So he can replace her
and live her life.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.328
Luke.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.030
So they can <i>only</i>
be for Haley?

00:31.032 --> 00:33.232
Of course not. Haley isn't
the only hottie living here.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.335
I washed the car in
my cheer shorts the other day.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.037
I definitely
felt eyes on me.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.040
Has it ever occurred to you that
those flowers could be for me?

00:41.042 --> 00:44.043
What do you mean?
I mean, like,
from my boyfriend.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.544
What?
You have a boyfriend?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.579
And you thought
<i>my</i> thing was crazy.

00:48.983 --> 00:52.084
Captions by <b> <i>vitac</i> </b>...

01:00.326 --> 01:01.427
¶¶¶

01:01.429 --> 01:02.828
Alex,
you have a boyfriend?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.830
You can't just drop that
and leave.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.166
Honey, it is so exciting.
Why didn't you tell us?

01:07.168 --> 01:08.600
Because I knew
you'd get all weird

01:08.602 --> 01:10.102
And ask
a million stupid questions.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.703
What does he look like?
How did you meet him?

01:11.705 --> 01:15.340
Okay, I'll show you a photo.

01:15.342 --> 01:18.210
Well, I would,
but now my phone's not working.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.511
Hmm.
Hmm.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.513
Oh! Oh, here he is.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.082
In the supermarket
flyer?

01:23.084 --> 01:24.583
That's him
pondering the pork chops?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.552
What's to ponder?
They're $4.59 a pound.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.454
I don't understand.
Why is he in this?

01:28.456 --> 01:29.888
He's a model, mom.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.523
Oh, wait, wait.
Your boyfriend's a model?

01:31.525 --> 01:33.192
Well,
how did you meet him?

01:33.194 --> 01:34.760
There's not much crossover

01:34.762 --> 01:37.463
For a national honor society
student and a pork model.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.064
Well, actually,
it's a really long story.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.466
I...

01:40.468 --> 01:42.601
Oh, well...
it's him.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.069
Hey, hold on.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.938
This is terrific news.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.207
I can't believe
she didn't tell us about him.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.875
Oh, <i>that's</i>
what you can't believe?

01:49.877 --> 01:52.044
What do you mean?
Phil, it is a little weird.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.612
I mean, suddenly
she has this boyfriend.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.647
She wants to show us a picture
on her phone, but she can't,

01:55.649 --> 01:57.816
And magically
he's in today's paper?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.453
I don't even want to say it.
Haley.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.754
She's making it up.
Mm.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.989
Why would she do that?

02:03.991 --> 02:05.557
Maybe she's upset

02:05.559 --> 02:07.593
That none of us thought
those roses could be for her.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.394
Oh, and remember when
she couldn't get a
date for homecoming?

02:09.395 --> 02:11.263
She said she didn't care,
but I caught her crying
in her room.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.599
Mm-hmm. Oh, honey,
what did you say to her?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.734
Oh, I-I was super late,
so I didn't really...

02:15.736 --> 02:16.768
This is sad.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.303
Alex has great news

02:18.305 --> 02:19.638
And her own mother and sister
don't believe her?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.507
I want to.
Well, I <i>do</i> believe her.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.609
I'm gonna tell her to invite
this boyfriend over for dinner,

02:23.611 --> 02:25.644
And I'll be serving a big,
old platter of "I told you so."

02:25.646 --> 02:27.346
Oh, great.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.581
Maybe you could also serve
unicorn burgers and magic beans,

02:29.583 --> 02:31.517
And I'll invite my boyfriend,
bigfoot!

02:31.519 --> 02:35.120
Still better than dylan.

02:35.122 --> 02:38.357
Okay. I got
a surprise for you.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.992
It better
not be another baby.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.327
Ta-da!

02:42.329 --> 02:44.196
Is there something fun
behind the couch?

02:44.198 --> 02:47.833
An edgar vanderkoff hand-crafted
blanc de blanc sofa.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.768
It was a wedding gift
to ourselves.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.303
Plus,
we're showing Lily

02:51.305 --> 02:53.305
That we trust her enough
to let us have one nice thing.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.806
When you think about it
like that,

02:54.808 --> 02:56.608
It's really a gift
for Lily.
Yeah.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.644
Ohh! Okay, whoa.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.779
We only get on this couch
when we know we're not dirty.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.681
That's why
we got <i>her</i> the couch.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.550
To teach her
about respect.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.351
Legs a little wider
please.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.320
Is that a cookie
in your back pocket?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.655
Yep.
Okay.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.391
Bup-up-up!
Hey, nice and slow.

03:13.893 --> 03:15.360
Unh-unh-unh-unh,
watching that.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.897
But now that I got you here,
what do you think?

03:18.899 --> 03:22.067
That you wore cargo shorts
to my middle-school graduation,

03:22.069 --> 03:24.636
But you're putting on a bow tie
for some dog's birthday party.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.039
It's all good fun.
The birnbaums can't have kids.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.574
They like to do it up big
for buster.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.242
I had my fifth birthday
in a break room

03:30.244 --> 03:32.477
Of a der wienerschnitzel,
but good for buster.

03:32.479 --> 03:33.912
Why are you so cranky?

03:35.382 --> 03:38.584
This kid at school
ripped me off for 40 bucks

03:38.586 --> 03:39.818
In a pyramid scheme.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.320
Did this
have something to do

03:41.322 --> 03:43.222
With that broken plastic pyramid
on your dresser?

03:43.224 --> 03:44.990
It looked like marble
in the picture.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.258
Oh, man.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.426
Where were you
when I was growing up?

03:47.428 --> 03:48.660
I'd have had
your dice and cigarettes

03:48.662 --> 03:50.162
Before
you got to homeroom.

03:50.164 --> 03:51.897
Where'd you go to school...
"guys and dolls"?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.565
Bright as you are,
you got to smarten up.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.168
You got to be more suspicious
of people.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.703
Stop being such a patsy.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.571
How is this
for the party?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.241
It's my first time
meeting your dog-park friends.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.742
Fantastic,
but be careful...

04:03.744 --> 04:05.277
Some of these guys are single
in the group.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.079
What a surprise.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.547
Manny,
we won't be late.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.415
I left dinner
for you and Joe,

04:10.417 --> 04:12.684
But don't eat the deviled eggs
that are in the refrigerator

04:12.686 --> 04:14.920
Because they're
for tomorrow's picnic.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.721
What picnic...
Somebody's cat going to college?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.724
No, some of Gloria's friends
are getting their green cards.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.192
It's actually
a nice group.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.361
Yes, they're very decent,
hardworking people.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.863
Jay met them
at mirabelle's fake wedding.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.531
Zooboo!

04:26.533 --> 04:28.533
No, you've already watched
"zooboo" six times today.

04:28.535 --> 04:29.701
We're gonna watch
a classic movie

04:29.703 --> 04:31.036
Right here
on the big screen.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.537
You better let him
watch his show.

04:32.539 --> 04:33.639
If not,
he's gonna freak out.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.973
Yesterday
I turned it off,

04:34.975 --> 04:36.842
And he bit
through one of the pool balls.

04:44.317 --> 04:45.717
Hey, Mitchell.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.319
Hi, uh, um...

04:47.321 --> 04:49.554
B...Renda. Ah!

04:49.556 --> 04:51.223
Yes, you thought I wasn't
gonna remember, didn't you?

04:51.225 --> 04:53.425
So, how's
your first week been?

04:53.427 --> 04:54.426
I'm getting a divorce.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.128
Oh. God.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.463
Um... Well, I did ask, so...

04:58.465 --> 05:00.399
It's really hard to be alone,
you know?

05:00.401 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.569
Hey, you know who else
who stays late is, um, stacey.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.338
14 months.
Oh, gosh.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.240
Well, sometimes it's good to get
in and out fast, though, huh?

05:08.242 --> 05:10.242
We haven't had sex
in 14 months.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.977
We were married
20 years.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.512
Well, that's a nice,
round number.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.080
Ohh!
Yeah.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.416
My restless leg syndrome,
like that's a reason to leave?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.984
Gah!
Well, you know,
everybody has...

05:18.986 --> 05:22.120
Especially after
all his habits and requests!

05:22.122 --> 05:25.590
God! I've done more paddling
than lewis and clark!

05:25.592 --> 05:28.026
Hey, stace,
you out there?

05:28.028 --> 05:30.696
Oh, she's gone.
People leave.
Well, you know,

05:30.698 --> 05:33.298
I-if there's anything
that I can do to help you...

05:33.300 --> 05:34.833
Could I stay with you?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.435
What's that?

05:36.437 --> 05:40.005
So, Larry's allowed
to sit on the couch and I'm not?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.540
Well,
Larry is white.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.375
Hey, you chose me.

05:43.377 --> 05:46.178
Oh, uh,
that's not what I meant.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.381
- Hello?
- Hey, Cam.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.782
So, listen, you remember

05:50.784 --> 05:52.517
My... my new friend
at work brenda, right?

05:52.519 --> 05:54.052
Who?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.487
That's right...
the pretty one.
Oh!

05:55.489 --> 05:57.055
Uh, so,
she and her husband

05:57.057 --> 05:58.390
Are... are going
through some problems at home,

05:58.392 --> 05:59.725
And she was wondering

05:59.727 --> 06:01.193
If she might be
able to stay at our house.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.861
Oh, my gosh.
Yes, of course.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.830
Oh,
shoot and darn it!

06:04.832 --> 06:07.032
I thought
we had something.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.467
Mitchell,
I know what you're doing.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.535
Ahh, there's no way
we can reschedule, huh?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.170
Fight your instincts.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.873
This is a chance for you
to show some real compassion.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.242
I need a zoloft.
Okay. Okay.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.877
Well,
I agree with all that,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.012
But I...
I am being nice!

06:21.014 --> 06:23.582
Okay?
I... I-I-I talked to her.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.550
I-I asked her if there was
anything I could do to help.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.819
But I... I didn't mean it.
Nobody ever means it.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.388
Mitchell, you want
this growth in your life.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.523
That's why you asked her.
You're just scared.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.760
No, no, it was
a completely hollow offer and...

06:34.762 --> 06:35.861
Yeah, that...
That's right.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.062
Okay, george
and wendy hollowoffer.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.497
Dinner at 7:30.
Okay, bye-bye.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.265
You need this,
and I need something nice

06:40.267 --> 06:42.200
To write about you
in our christmas letter.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.035
I love you, too.
Goodbye.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.872
So... Bad news, huh?

06:46.874 --> 06:50.842
Well, only
if you hate home cooking.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.277
Oh!

06:52.279 --> 06:53.779
You're the best!
So...

06:53.781 --> 06:54.546
Mm!

06:54.548 --> 06:56.047
Mm.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.682
I think you got some
of my zoloft.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.050
That's okay.
I could use it.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.759
Bark mitzvah...
What a concept.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.194
Beagles and lox,
dog briskets.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.596
Whoever's in charge
of the wordplay, bravo.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.632
Is this for dogs
or for people?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.734
I hope it's for people.
I've had four of them.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.936
Are you having fun?
<i>Ay,</i> yes.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.306
Before today, I had never
seen a gravy fountain.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.709
Oh, gumdrop, look!
Stella's here!

07:24.711 --> 07:26.278
Everybody,
let's get a picture.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.582
Pupparazzi!
How great is that?

07:30.584 --> 07:31.817
Everybody squeeze in.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.320
Be careful of her cysts.
She'll nip you.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.555
O-okay.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.423
Okay, one more.
Doodles blinked.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.392
Now, really get tight
this time.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.793
No! No, no, no!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.929
Enough. Enough.
Oh, Gloria... Gloria.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.397
Gloria, honey,
I... listen.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.065
I-I know
you're not a dog person.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.500
No, I'm okay
with the dogs.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.669
I'm just not
a dog-person person.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.939
You said that this party
was going to be normal.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.106
It's just fun.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.243
There's a buffet
and an open bar for dogs.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.345
My cousin
got married on a raft.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.515
I tried to play along, Jay,
but... but this is crazy.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.983
I have to go home.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.485
Gloria, now,
do you think it's fair

08:06.487 --> 08:08.854
To use the word "crazy"
about a...

08:11.325 --> 08:14.259
I-I'll see you at home,
Gloria.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.996
Oh, thank you so much,
you guys.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.599
God, where were you when I was
looking for the perfect man?

08:20.601 --> 08:21.933
Well,
probably in missouri

08:21.935 --> 08:23.034
At a bar called
kansas city meats

08:23.036 --> 08:24.503
Doing the same thing.
Funny!

08:26.306 --> 08:28.173
Look at that smile.
What?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.609
That's what being nice
feels like.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.611
I like it.
I'm proud of you.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.845
Well, I'm just
letting a person

08:33.847 --> 08:35.447
I barely know
sleep in my home.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.715
I don't know if I'd use
the word "hero," but...

08:36.717 --> 08:37.982
"hero"?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.351
Stop it.
You're embarrassing me.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.355
Oh, god.
Oh!

08:43.357 --> 08:45.056
Hey,
you guys have a cat?

08:45.058 --> 08:47.058
Um, how about I freshen up
that wine, huh?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.060
Oh, no. I am good.
Okay, um...

08:49.062 --> 08:51.463
In fact, Cam, what
are... what are we doing
in the living room, here?

08:51.465 --> 08:52.531
You know?

08:52.533 --> 08:54.165
Yeah, oh,
you know what?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.967
We haven't even given brenda
a tour of our ga... uh, garage.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.402
Our... our garage.
Oh, no.
I don't like garages.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.638
That's where doug
kept his precious sailboat.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.872
No eating on the boat.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.507
No drinking on the boat.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.209
All because the one time
I went on the boat, I spilled.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.978
Well, guess what.
Boats go like this.
Oh, geez.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.347
Whoo! You know?!
And I'm like...

09:10.751 --> 09:13.752
Who... who loves a thing
more than a person?

09:13.754 --> 09:14.920
A monster.
Mm.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.855
Have we shown you
our shed?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.390
There's a shed.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.091
He knew what he was
getting into when he married me.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.093
I'm a little messy.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.828
Well, guess what, doug!

09:23.830 --> 09:26.197
Life's a little messy.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.334
Okay, my sinuses leak,
my... my ears run,

09:29.336 --> 09:31.937
And I have
hyperactive sweat glands, but...

09:31.939 --> 09:34.940
You know what?
I do need a refill.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.675
Yeah.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.777
Well, I'm not surprised.
She's losing a lot of fluids.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.446
It's as if doug was over here.
I know. I saw that.

09:42.682 --> 09:43.782
Alec!

09:43.784 --> 09:45.450
Hey.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.119
His dumb dad got transferred
to dumb africa

09:48.121 --> 09:49.955
To operate on some dumb babies.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.958
So fixing <i>their</i> hearts
is worth breaking <i>mine?</i>

09:52.960 --> 09:54.292
It's kind of worth it.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.961
He can do
like six operations a day.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.763
Yeah. I-I-I understand.
I'm sorry I'm lashing out.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.232
I-I just
really like you.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.634
I still like you.

10:02.636 --> 10:06.271
You're making this worse.
Bye, alec.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.373
Bye, Alex.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.774
Hey.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.242
I knew you couldn't leave
without one last kiss!

10:11.244 --> 10:13.812
We can work this out!

10:13.814 --> 10:16.815
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna
regret that, aren't I?

10:16.817 --> 10:19.284
Uh, I was hoping you could
throw this away for me.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.353
Yeah. Sure.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.496
So, honey,
we've been talking,

10:31.498 --> 10:33.431
And we want to meet
your boyfriend.
Mm-hmm.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.233
You just missed him.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.334
He was here?

10:36.336 --> 10:39.738
He just left.
This is his cup.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.272
Oh, look at that.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.175
Oh, it looks
like "Alex."

10:44.177 --> 10:46.778
His name is alec.
The "c" just got smudged.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.814
Honey, his name is alec.
But the "c" got smudged.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.683
Yeah, um, well,
why don't you just text him

10:51.685 --> 10:53.284
And then invite him back
for dinner?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.120
I can't.
He broke up with me.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.421
Mm.
Oh, no.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.823
He's moving to africa.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.593
Because they need
grocery models in africa.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.862
Honey, I'm so sorry.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.096
They broke up.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.765
I miss him.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.500
Oh, don't worry.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.269
Soon it will be like
he never existed.

11:12.471 --> 11:14.139
Okay.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.940
<i>Ay, dios mío,</i> Manny.
What's going on with Joe?

11:15.942 --> 11:17.308
He's a drug addict.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.045
After two hours
of mind-liquefying "zooboo,"

11:20.047 --> 11:22.781
I briefly put on a classic
movie, and he freaked out.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.182
If he could walk better,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.384
I'd seriously suggest
a 12-step program.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.620
<i>Ay,</i> no, Joe.
No more "zooboo."

11:28.622 --> 11:31.656
Thank you.
<i>Ay,</i> no.
Turn the big tv off.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.759
If he sees it on, he's going to
want to watch his show.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.729
Why are you home?

11:37.731 --> 11:40.732
Buster's party
was a bark mitzvah.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.702
I don't know why Jay
would take me to this place.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.803
I don't know.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.471
Maybe this dog stuff
is his way

11:46.473 --> 11:48.640
Of trying to find
a common interest with you.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.408
It's hard.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.378
You don't like golf or scotch
or eisenhower documentaries.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.080
It's true.
I don't like ike.

11:55.082 --> 11:58.216
But the people in this party,
they are so obsessed with dogs.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.519
Even the punch bowl
was in the shape of a toilet.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.154
Well, it's not like Jay

12:03.156 --> 12:04.823
Doesn't get out of
his comfort zone for you.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.858
He's going to your
green-card picnic tomorrow.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.326
You're right.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.930
He even bought star-spangled
sombreros for everybody.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.264
It's the wrong country.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.734
He never listens,
but... but he's sweet.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.602
You know what?

12:17.604 --> 12:19.871
I should go back
to that party.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.573
You guys want to come?

12:21.575 --> 12:23.441
Might as well.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.877
They had a pretty good spread
at buster's bris.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.912
Okay, let's get this woman
into bed

12:27.914 --> 12:30.348
And, in the morning, out of
the house as fast as we can.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.250
Honestly, I don't know
how straight guys do it.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.852
Probably without
those hand gestures.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.454
So, nice bath? Ahh.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.857
Oh, yeah, the best.
I'm so ready for bed.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.025
Okay.
Ooh, by the way,
I left a ring in there.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.128
Oh, well, we'll get at it
with some bleach in the morning.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.529
No, no, no,
my wedding ring.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.864
I just don't feel
like wearing it anymore.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.198
Oh, well,
goodbye, bad memories,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.234
Hello to our guest couch,
the cloud.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.468
Ahh!

12:50.470 --> 12:52.237
That's a small cloud.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.805
Oh, you know what?
It's deceptively comfy.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.440
I sleep on it all the time.
Oh.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.108
Yeah, if I don't
beat him to it first.
Really?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.743
Oh, okay.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.445
All right.
So, there you are.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.980
Okay.
Okay, yeah.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.481
I'm not... I'm pretty sure
this isn't gonna work.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.949
No, no, this will be fine.
This will be fine.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.284
This is what I always do.
It's not a big deal.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.752
Just make this up nice
for you.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.053
There we go. Okay.
Oh, my.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.321
See you
in the morning.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.656
Yeah, but my...
My head's...

13:11.658 --> 13:13.558
Oh.
What we were thinking?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.160
Here. Come on.
There it is right there.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.494
There you go.
Okay. Night-night.
Night-night.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.495
Hey, guys.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.097
Here's an idea.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.066
What if I just slept on
your couch in the living room?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.335
Uh...
Uh...

13:26.306 --> 13:27.639
Uh...

13:27.641 --> 13:28.673
I'm shaking.

13:28.675 --> 13:29.974
Why? Problem solved.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.110
No, she's making
the whole house shake.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:41.921 --> 13:44.789
Hey, guys. You're back?
What's going on?

13:44.791 --> 13:47.025
I'm sorry. I love you,
and you love dog parties.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.527
So that means
that I love dog parties.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.929
You don't think
it's crazy anymore?

13:50.931 --> 13:52.363
I didn't say that.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.165
But Manny's right.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.702
We should get more involved
in each other's activities.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.671
Wow.
So, this was <i>your</i> idea?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.272
Well, it's sort of
the foundation

14:01.274 --> 14:03.341
Of any healthy marriage,
but I did bring it up.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.609
This is great!

14:04.611 --> 14:06.010
Well, come on.
Give me a hand.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.812
We'll grab you and your mom
an ice-cream bone.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.180
Oh.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.715
I didn't do much.
I just...

14:10.717 --> 14:12.784
Ruined my plan, that's all.
I wanted her to leave!

14:12.786 --> 14:14.118
What?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.386
She was supposed to
storm out of here.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.222
And after,
I go home and say,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.324
"maybe we should
do some things separately."

14:19.326 --> 14:21.826
I was gonna use
her bailing out of this

14:21.828 --> 14:24.562
As a chip to get out of
that stupid picnic tomorrow.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.964
But now
I've got no chip.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.866
Hey, how about next time
you devise a plan

14:27.868 --> 14:30.001
To avoid expressing a feeling,
clue me in.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.203
You can't be clued in.
You're a patsy.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.472
Hey, um, there was talk
of an ice-cream bone?

14:34.474 --> 14:37.675
I made that up, too.
Use your head!

14:39.212 --> 14:41.312
Hey, honey, you alone?

14:41.314 --> 14:43.715
Do you see anyone else
in here?

14:43.717 --> 14:45.483
Do you?

14:45.485 --> 14:49.020
Sweetheart, your father and I
think we owe you an apology.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.588
For what?
Well, this morning

14:50.590 --> 14:52.657
When we didn't think
the rose could be for you,

14:52.659 --> 14:54.559
It seemed like
maybe it hurt your feelings.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.261
I guess. A little.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.196
I am so sorry
to make you feel bad.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.366
And it is completely believable
that you would have an admirer.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.400
Okay.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.735
What we're worried
about

15:03.737 --> 15:05.737
Is that we have created
an environment

15:05.739 --> 15:08.039
In which you feel
it's necessary to...

15:08.041 --> 15:09.540
Embelli...
Fanta...

15:09.542 --> 15:10.875
Exagger...
Oh, my god.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.510
You guys don't think
alec is real?

15:12.512 --> 15:14.779
Sweetheart, I remember
the pressure there was

15:14.781 --> 15:17.015
To fit in in high school.
So do I.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.350
And whether you try to fit in
by saying you fought a baby bear

15:19.352 --> 15:21.619
Or by making up
a boyfriend...

15:21.621 --> 15:23.254
You guys
are so unbelievable.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.956
You really think
I'm that pathetic

15:24.958 --> 15:27.258
That I'd have to create
some imaginary boyfriend?

15:27.260 --> 15:30.528
You know what's not imaginary?
Your feelings.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.063
Okay, don't! Don't!

15:32.065 --> 15:34.132
F.Y.I., I changed
my facebook status to "single"

15:34.134 --> 15:35.733
About an hour ago,
and guess what.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.068
I already have a date.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.103
You don't believe me,
do you?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.105
Sweetheart, you've had
two boyfriends in 30 seconds.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.473
That practically
Haley's record.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.876
Well, he's real.
His name is teddy.

15:44.878 --> 15:47.378
His name is... Teddy?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.947
Yeah, uh-huh.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.481
Teddy keyes.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.583
Oh.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.786
And what do we know
about this young man?

15:54.788 --> 15:56.387
He's new to our school.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.224
He works at some mattress
store... mattress king.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.893
And he's a bit
of a bad boy.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.761
He had a little problem
with shoplifting.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.563
He spent some time
in juvie.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.299
But, you know, he's not really
my type. He's just a rebound.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.667
So I guess
it doesn't really matter.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.602
Ugh, why am I
even talking to you guys?

16:11.604 --> 16:12.537
Leave!

16:14.173 --> 16:15.873
Get out!

16:19.178 --> 16:20.778
Did you see the look
in her eyes?

16:20.780 --> 16:22.447
Like she believed
everything she was saying.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.415
That's terrifying.
Like this guy I knew in college.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.317
He was always telling me
about these "crazy parties"

16:26.319 --> 16:27.585
That were
"full of women."

16:27.587 --> 16:28.753
But when I'd ask him
where they were,

16:28.755 --> 16:30.088
He'd give me
a fake address.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.323
Makes me wonder
what else she's making up.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.692
I have never met that girl
she tutors in math.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.027
Esther choi?
Me neither.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.695
Because
she doesn't exist!

16:37.697 --> 16:40.365
There is not an esther choi on
earth who needs math tutoring.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.500
She needs help, Claire.
What do we do?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.102
I mean, should we send her
back to that therapist?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.436
The one
we've never met?

16:45.438 --> 16:47.271
No! Wait!

16:47.273 --> 16:49.907
Don't open it! Move away!
It's for me! Move!

16:53.112 --> 16:55.346
Damn. You look hot.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.382
The roses are from you, teddy?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.817
Yeah, I met a guy in juvie
who works at the cemetery.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.486
They got flowers
all over the place.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.654
Oh,
I also got you this.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.455
Sweet. Let's go.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.992
My other one of these cracked,
so you can use this one.

17:07.993 --> 17:09.527
Okay.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.296
Yes! Our little girl
isn't crazy!

17:12.298 --> 17:13.397
Teddy's real!

17:13.400 --> 17:15.733
Real freaky!
I'm going!

17:19.539 --> 17:21.539
Cam, you're snoring.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.707
What? Sorry.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.710
Was that me?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.912
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.814
What is she doing
out here?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.183
Well, she has
that restless leg.
Both of them?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.886
Oh, my gosh,
get the ice cream!

17:34.888 --> 17:36.187
What do we do?
Should we wake her up?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.588
And say what?

17:37.590 --> 17:39.757
"Would you mind terribly
getting off our couch?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.159
You seem to
be glazing it."

17:41.161 --> 17:42.527
Do you have
a better idea?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.362
Okay, okay,
go around the back.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.730
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.366
We'll get this
underneath her.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.868
Once, I helped a sow give birth
to nine baby piglets

17:50.870 --> 17:52.236
On our living room floor.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.238
Didn't get a drop of nothin'
on the linoleum.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.007
We're gonna get back to why
the sow was in the living room.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.241
Lady di's wedding.
It was beautiful.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.543
Cam,
she's gonna wake up.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.344
Oh, please, she's got
enough pills in her,

18:00.346 --> 18:01.879
She's gonna rattle
like a maraca.

18:01.881 --> 18:02.947
Roll!

18:02.949 --> 18:06.217
Doug, no, I don't wanna.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.186
Okay, okay, what do I do?
What do I do?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.787
You come back
around this way.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.422
No, doug.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.257
Now, what we're gonna do
is I'll push her this way

18:13.259 --> 18:14.292
And pull the blanket.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.194
Okay, I got to pull her?
Okay.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.864
I'm losing her.
I'm losing her.
Oh!

18:22.901 --> 18:25.303
This could work, too.
It's fine.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.471
Ow!

18:26.473 --> 18:27.972
Hi.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.040
Hey.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.808
What... what happened?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.477
You were having
a really bad dream,

18:32.479 --> 18:34.378
And then you rolled right off
of our uncomfortable sofa.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.647
I'm sorry.
I-I was lonely.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.249
I Came out here,

18:38.251 --> 18:40.384
And then I wound up
waking up the whole house.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.487
I'm the worst houseguest
in the world!

18:42.489 --> 18:43.821
Don't.
Don't.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.957
Doug was right.
I'm gonna die alone.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.925
Don't.
Don't.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.293
Okay, come on.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.162
Can you please
be quiet?

18:51.164 --> 18:54.065
I'm so sorry, Lily.
It's all my fault.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.633
My head hurts.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.768
I'm gonna get you
some aspirin.
Okay.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.405
Cam, are we
terrible people?

19:01.407 --> 19:03.341
For protecting
a vanderkoff?

19:03.343 --> 19:04.742
He hanged himself
last year.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.477
It's not like they're
making more of those.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.945
We just rolled
a bipolar divorcée

19:07.947 --> 19:09.080
Face-first
onto a hardwood floor.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.448
All to protect a couch.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.017
It's not just a couch.
Our one nice thing.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.953
The last seven years have been
about sticky countertops

19:15.955 --> 19:18.456
And horsy shower curtains
and childproof locks.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.024
Do you know
what's in this drawer?

19:20.026 --> 19:21.425
I don't know
what's in this drawer.
I have no idea.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.094
Look, I know it's frustrating,
all right?

19:23.096 --> 19:24.862
But is that really a reason
to choose a thing over a person?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.331
I mean, come on.
We're no better than doug.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.302
I guess it's not a great example
to set for Lily.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.671
Maybe we <i>don't</i> deserve
one nice thing.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.375
"And when the sun
Came out, all the turtles,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.677
from abner to zeke,
had fun at the picnic."

19:39.679 --> 19:41.979
Mnh.
"a rainy day for turtles."

19:41.981 --> 19:44.715
Aww. It always
makes Lily feel better.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.384
I guess
she just thought that...

19:46.386 --> 19:49.220
We do have
one nice thing.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.688
"And a beautiful rain..."

19:51.958 --> 19:53.925
Well, we don't have to
watch it die.

19:58.463 --> 20:00.198
Let's go, Jay!

20:00.200 --> 20:02.667
We're supposed to be
at the picnic in 20 minutes!

20:02.669 --> 20:04.402
They've been living in a van
for six years.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.504
They can wait
a little longer.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.040
So, today,
instead of watching the game,

20:09.042 --> 20:11.209
I'll be playing lawn darts
with colombians,

20:11.211 --> 20:13.010
Thanks to you
not using your brain.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.412
Here we go...
"the sting."

20:14.414 --> 20:16.013
Well, someone's getting
what they want today.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.249
You finally get to watch
your precious movie, huh?

20:18.251 --> 20:20.418
"A classic tale
about a long con."

20:20.420 --> 20:21.752
Well, you're welcome.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.821
Wait a minute.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.856
"Rogues and double-crossers
abound.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.525
Who will
outsmart whom?"

20:27.527 --> 20:28.726
Son of a bitch.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.595
You knew I was
using the bark mitzvah

20:30.597 --> 20:32.096
As a bargaining chip.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.365
That's why you talked Gloria
into coming back...

20:34.367 --> 20:36.867
So I couldn't weasel my way
out of this stupid picnic

20:36.869 --> 20:38.669
And you'd get
the big tv.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.571
Well,
I'm onto you now.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.707
I was just reading
off the dvd box.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.547
I mean, can you believe

20:49.549 --> 20:50.948
All the stuff brenda
brought for one night?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.883
I know. Look at all this stuff
over here.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.118
Super replenishing balm?

20:54.120 --> 20:56.120
Uh, pore-reducing
booster serum?

20:56.122 --> 20:58.889
Anti-aging
buffing beads?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.192
It must be so hard
to be a girl.

21:01.194 --> 21:02.560
I know. I know.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.694
It really makes
you worry about the world

21:03.696 --> 21:05.363
We're sending
Lily out into.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.864
Well, there's so much pressure
on girls to be perfect.

21:06.866 --> 21:07.865
You ready?
Yep.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.535
The thing is, Cam, all we can do
is instill our beliefs in her

21:11.537 --> 21:13.271
And hope that she makes
good choices.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.605
Calming mister?

21:14.607 --> 21:15.806
It does feel nice
to talk about it.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.208
No, this is
a calming mister.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.909
I just bought this.
Oh, god, yes.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.111
