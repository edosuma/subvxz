CHRIS ROCK:
Growing up in Bed-Stuy,

00:07.275 --> 00:10.244
one holiday I looked forward to
was Easter.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.246
That's two boxes of dye
and a dozen eggs.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.247
That it?

00:13.281 --> 00:15.116
Almost.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.317
You were dressed up,
girls were dressed up

00:16.350 --> 00:19.120
and it was a good day
to pretend you were on a date.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.122
Since Tasha and I went
to the same church,

00:21.155 --> 00:22.490
she was the perfect choice.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.524
So,

00:23.557 --> 00:26.127
you gonna be in that
Easter pageant next week?

00:26.160 --> 00:27.195
Yeah.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.162
Got an escort?

00:28.196 --> 00:29.197
Please say no.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.698
Yeah-- Robert.

00:30.731 --> 00:31.765
Hey.
Get lost.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.234
What's up?
Did you remember

00:33.267 --> 00:34.568
to get the Epsom salt
for your grandmother?

00:36.104 --> 00:37.538
Got it.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.407
* All I think about...

00:39.440 --> 00:40.774
I wasn't proud of it,

00:40.808 --> 00:43.111
but I prayed something bad
would happen to him.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.216
Oh, my God!

00:48.249 --> 00:51.585
Robert, how will I
ever get over this?!

00:53.287 --> 00:55.256
Oh, I'll help you.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.258
Yeah, I'll help you.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.692
I never got that meteor,

00:58.726 --> 01:00.528
but something almost as good
happened.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.595
Why would you
say that?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.397
That's not what
I said.
I heard what
you said.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.199
Why do you have
to be so stupid?
You're stupid!

01:05.233 --> 01:06.467
No, you're
stupid.
I hate you!

01:06.500 --> 01:07.668
It's quits!
I hate you.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.670
I love this.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.172
* When I think of you...

01:11.205 --> 01:13.141
You okay?
It's nothing.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.375
Just forget it.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.610
Time to bust a move, Dumb MC.

01:18.646 --> 01:22.183
Chris, are you going to the
Easter pageant with anybody?

01:22.216 --> 01:23.517
Yeah, Lisa Bonet.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.618
No. Why?

01:24.652 --> 01:26.854
Would you escort me?

01:26.887 --> 01:29.290
Yeah.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.591
Great.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.127
It's a date.

01:33.161 --> 01:36.430
Tasha was on the rebound,
so I made like Dikembe Mutombo.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.509
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:48.542 --> 01:52.513

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:56.550 --> 02:00.554
When you get into a Volkswagen,
it gets into you.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.301
The biggest deal at our house
on Easter

02:13.334 --> 02:15.736
was my mother's church hat
because a church hat on Easter

02:15.769 --> 02:18.206
was like a gown
at the Oscars.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.208
Hey, girl!

02:20.241 --> 02:21.542
Here she comes.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.544
Rochelle?
Rochelle?
Hi, Shaun.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.813
Oh, that hat
is fabulous!

02:25.846 --> 02:27.281
Thank you.
Who is it?

02:27.315 --> 02:29.283
It's a Sean Gianni Vermani.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.285
Love you, girl.
You look fabulous!

02:31.319 --> 02:33.287
Come on, Julius.
Oh, yes.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.925
Julius, come back here.
I need you to help me

02:37.958 --> 02:39.427
pick out
my Easter hat.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.761
I'd rather
pick cotton.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.296
It would be less backbreaking.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.432
Rochelle, we've been doing
this for months.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.699
Just pick one.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.701
Julius, you just don't
pick out a hat.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.403
A hat picks you.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.771
Okay, now tell me,

02:50.804 --> 02:52.773
which one of these
will look better on me?

02:52.806 --> 02:53.807
I don't know.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.409
Where's your dress?

02:55.443 --> 02:56.710
I put it on layaway.

02:56.744 --> 02:57.945
It's not out yet.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.580
Ooh, which reminds me,
I need ten dollars.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.316
My mother didn't put
the dress on layaway

03:02.350 --> 03:03.551
because it was expensive.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.220
She just started planning
for Easter at Thanksgiving.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.389
Mom, why is this cranberry sauce
shaped like a rabbit?

03:08.422 --> 03:10.858
Because I was testing out
my new Easter molds.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.460
Who wants gravy?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.194
Nobody!

03:15.896 --> 03:17.398
Ah...

03:17.431 --> 03:18.799
While my mother
was judging hats,

03:18.832 --> 03:20.334
Greg was judging me.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.569
Don't you think
it's kind of weird

03:21.602 --> 03:22.870
to have a date
on Easter?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.538
Less weird than not
having a date ever.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.706
Besides, it's
not a date.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.874
It's an opportunity.

03:26.907 --> 03:27.908
I guess you're right.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.343
Maybe I should
go back to church.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.011
You know,
score some babes.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.045
When Greg went back to church,

03:32.079 --> 03:34.415
the only one who hit on him
was the priest.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.849
It's just that Robert's
out of the picture.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.518
If I'm ever gonna have
a shot with Tasha,

03:37.551 --> 03:38.786
this is it.
I hear ya.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.388
Kick a man
when he's down,

03:40.421 --> 03:41.389
that's what
I always say.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.391
That was the only time
he ever said that.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.758
Whose side are you on?

03:44.792 --> 03:45.926
Yours.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.295
The guy's an idiot.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.729
I haven't even been
on one date,

03:48.762 --> 03:50.798
and I know you don't
break up with a girl

03:50.831 --> 03:52.266
before a holiday.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.501
A girl by herself
on a holiday

03:53.534 --> 03:54.802
is like an
ice-cream cone in hell.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.670
It ain't gonna
be there very long.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.606
I know I always say this,
but this time,

03:58.639 --> 04:00.341
dude, you truly are
in there.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.443
Wait.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.977
Do you even know
what an escort does?

04:04.011 --> 04:07.581
I do,
but this is a family show.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.583
Meanwhile, my mother
was wearing out shoes

04:09.617 --> 04:11.285
looking for a hat.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.486
Rochelle,

04:12.520 --> 04:14.355
this is the sixth hat shop
we've been to today.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.222
Yeah, but they say

04:15.255 --> 04:17.358
this is the best hat
shop in Brooklyn.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.426
Why didn't we
come here first?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.794
Well, how would I know if
it's the best hat shop

04:20.828 --> 04:22.696
if I didn't visit all
the lousy ones first?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.665
That's how Vanessa
looked for a husband.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.700
Oh, yeah, girl,
this is nice.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.572
Oh, can I help you?

04:31.605 --> 04:34.442
Yes. I'm looking
for a church hat for Easter.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.743
Not just a church hat.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.378
She needs the churchiest
hat you've got.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.512
Uh-oh,

04:38.546 --> 04:41.482
sounds like somebody's
getting into a hat competition.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.318
Oh, no, she's not getting
into the competition.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.053
Shethe competition.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.356
Rochelle is
the three-time winner

04:48.389 --> 04:50.424
of th Double Rock
on Zion's Holy Gospel

04:50.458 --> 04:51.892
Temple of Bethesda
Christian Worship

04:51.925 --> 04:53.461
Baptist Church
Easter Hat Show.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.696
Uh-huh. She's about
to make it number four.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.531
Hello.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.533
You are Rochelle!

04:59.567 --> 05:00.901
I heard about you.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.470
I'm Hattie.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.704
Hi, Hattie.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.706
Well, this is my friend,
Vanessa.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.775
Well, how did you hear
about me?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.778
Well, I just joined your church,
and I have been told

05:10.811 --> 05:13.447
that nobody can beat you.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.015
You know that's right.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.384
You work here?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.386
No, I own the shop.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.388
Thus the name.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.022
Oh.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.857
Well, it's very nice.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.859
You have some
really lovely hats.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.496
Um, do you have this one
in a medium?

05:28.529 --> 05:29.963
Oh, if I did,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.031
I wouldn't sell it to you.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.966
What?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.502
You see,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.837
I plan on winning
the hat competition

05:36.870 --> 05:38.672
this year.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.675
And as much as I would love
your business,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.744
I'd be a fool
to sell you a hat.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.779
She told her.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.453
Well, uh, Miss Hattie--

05:52.486 --> 05:54.455
thus the name--

05:54.488 --> 05:56.524
I don't know who you think
you are, and I don't know...

05:56.557 --> 05:59.827
No, I'll tell
you who I am.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.896
I'm the five-time winner

06:02.930 --> 06:08.836
of the Fort Greene Greater
Faith Holy Baptist Temple

06:08.869 --> 06:13.407
of Divinity C.O.G.I.C.
Easter Spectacular,

06:13.441 --> 06:15.743
and I have graced the cover
six times

06:15.776 --> 06:18.612
of Hat Weekly
waiting on the seventh.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.648
Isn't that right, Levin?

06:20.681 --> 06:23.517
Well, Miss Hattie...

06:23.551 --> 06:26.854
here's a... a dime.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.556
Oh,

06:28.589 --> 06:29.623
what's that for?

06:29.657 --> 06:30.491
For you to call
somebody

06:30.524 --> 06:31.759
who really cares.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.093
Yeah,

06:33.126 --> 06:35.563
because I'm going to...

06:35.596 --> 06:37.898
win that competition.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.633
We'll see about that.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.635
Oh, yes, we will.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.804
While my mother was steaming,
Come on, Nessa.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.840
at home,
things were boiling over.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.511
Chris, how long does it take
to boil eggs?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.546
I think they're done.
I told you.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.649
What are y'all
doing anyway?

06:55.683 --> 06:57.918
I mean, I thought you
already dyed eggs for Easter.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.020
We did. These eggs
are for the church egg hunt.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.455
Me and Drew are bringing extra

07:01.489 --> 07:02.923
so I can have a head start
on winning.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.625
That's cheating.

07:04.658 --> 07:05.826
Not if I don't get caught.

07:05.859 --> 07:09.497
Now Tonya uses the same logic
when she does her taxes.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.899
All right, but you better not
let Mama catch you either.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.067
I didn't think about that.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.235
Don't worry.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.737
I'll hide them
in the refrigerator.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.607
Who'd think of looking
for eggs there?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.074
While Tonya and Drew
were getting ready

07:21.108 --> 07:22.576
to become career criminals,

07:22.610 --> 07:24.578
I was getting ready
for my date with Tasha.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.079
Uh, Chris,

07:26.113 --> 07:27.981
if you look on that
shelf over there,

07:28.015 --> 07:30.518
there's an ointment that'll
help you with that.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.953
Thanks, Doc,
but I don't need any ointment.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.589
So why you walking like
there's something swollen,

07:35.623 --> 07:37.691
itching or burning?
Oh,

07:37.725 --> 07:39.693
'cause Tasha asked me to escort
her in the Easter pageant.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.728
So I'm practicing my walk.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.096
Walk like that in Bed-Stuy,
you better run.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.197
Why?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.566
She seen you walk before?

07:45.599 --> 07:46.800
Yeah, I know.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.669
It's just that she just broke up
with Robert.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.038
So if I impress her now,
she'll forget all about him.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.642
And you will stroll right
in and be her new man.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.776
Exactly.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.277
You think that's
gonna work?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.579
Why wouldn't it?

07:58.612 --> 08:01.014
Because she's on the rebound.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.783
Rebound?
Yeah.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.620
When you break up with somebody,
the next person you end up with,

08:06.654 --> 08:08.789
they got you on the rebound.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.158
A person on the rebound
will be with anybody

08:11.191 --> 08:12.893
just to forget the person
they just left.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.762
So who do you have
to break up with

08:14.795 --> 08:15.929
to end up with Bobby Brown?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.065
Well, if I got anything
to do with it,

08:18.098 --> 08:19.567
she gonna forget
all about him.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.835
Maybe if he hit her in the head
with a brick.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.538
Well, you got
a whole day.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.874
You got plenty of time.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.909
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.010
Hey, Chris.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.244
Hey, Tasha, what's up?

08:31.278 --> 08:32.913
My grandmother
just told me

08:32.946 --> 08:34.715
we're not going
to our church this Sunday.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.283
She wants me
to do the pageant

08:36.316 --> 08:38.686
at her old church
in Queens.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.820
Queens?

08:39.853 --> 08:42.089
Sorry.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.625
The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.994
Now let's go to commercial
before I start cursing.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.035
Even though Tasha was going
to another church on Easter,

08:55.068 --> 08:57.304
I wasn't gonna let that stop me
from going with her.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.306
Hey, Tasha, wait up.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.674
What?

09:00.708 --> 09:01.775
What time is the Easter pageant

09:01.809 --> 09:02.910
at your grandmother's
old church.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.645
After the early service at 4:00.

09:04.678 --> 09:05.679
Why?

09:05.713 --> 09:08.348
I'll be there.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.683
Really?

09:09.717 --> 09:12.019
Yeah, I'll be there.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.687
Thanks, Chris.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.624
I'll see you Sunday.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.261
While I was going all out
for Tasha,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.263
Drew and Tonya were going
all out to win.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.698
We need to figure out
a way

09:24.732 --> 09:26.333
to get these eggs
to church.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.568
I got an idea.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.172
Come over here.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.847
This is where I hide
all my stuff from mommy.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.881
Shh.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.916
Don't tell her.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.656
I hope she doesn't have
a gun in there.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.724
All right, put the
eggs in here.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.096
Be careful.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.806
Now all I got to do
is convince Daddy

10:05.839 --> 10:07.207
to let me bring my
baby doll to church.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.676
Cool.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.743
While Drew and Tonya
were stacking the deck,

10:09.777 --> 10:12.345
my mother was stacking
her hat.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.181
Girl, I have
been working

10:14.214 --> 10:15.883
on this hat
all day.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.117
You want to see it?
Yes!

10:17.150 --> 10:19.152
Open, open, open!

10:22.055 --> 10:24.024
Oh...

10:24.057 --> 10:25.358
That's what I'm
talking about.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.426
That's a hat.

10:26.459 --> 10:30.197
I just have to do
one last thing.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.199
Ooh! Ooh!

10:32.232 --> 10:34.367
What's wrong?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.770
Ooh, that's a
bad hat, girl!

10:36.804 --> 10:39.006
Hattie's gonna wish she never
even messed with you!

10:39.039 --> 10:42.242
And peacocks wished they'd
stayed out of your way, too.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.011
By the time Easter came,

10:44.044 --> 10:45.846
my family was working
on more schemes

10:45.879 --> 10:47.715
than a pop star in rehab.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.316
Rochelle, I got
some bad news.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.751
What?

10:50.784 --> 10:51.685
I have to work today.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.686
I can go
to the service,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.154
but after that I have to leave.
No, he don't.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.322
What are you talking about?

10:55.355 --> 10:56.690
Nobody works on Easter.

10:56.724 --> 10:57.657
He doesn't either.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.727
Hey, what can I tell ya?
I just got the call.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.728
I didn't hear the phone.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.796
Never rang.
Maybe you were in the bathroom.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.964
I wasn't in the bathroom.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.465
I ain't hear it either.
You hear the phone?

11:05.498 --> 11:06.800
I didn't hear the phone.
You hear the phone?

11:06.834 --> 11:07.701
No, I didn't hear the phone.

11:07.735 --> 11:08.769
Well, I answered it
on the first ring.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.837
No, he didn't.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.771
One of the guys got sick.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.740
They're offering
quadruple double overtime.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.974
DREW:
Quadruple double overtime?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.375
I never heard of that.
You heard of that?

11:15.408 --> 11:16.109
Never heard of that.

11:16.143 --> 11:16.744
You heard of that?

11:16.777 --> 11:17.778
No, I ain't heard of that.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.246
I can't pass it up.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.413
Well, it does sound
like a lot of money.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.514
It is.
No, it's not.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.751
Well, who's gonna escort me
in the Easter Hat Show?

11:23.784 --> 11:24.651
Drew can.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.086
Why I gotta go?
How come you can't go?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.087
I gotta help Tonya hunt eggs.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.021
I can help Tonya
hunt eggs.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.089
Not if I can help it.

11:29.122 --> 11:29.957
Nah, I don't want you

11:29.990 --> 11:31.358
to mess your suit up.
You know what?

11:31.391 --> 11:32.826
Chris is right.
Drew can escort me.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.461
But, Chris, I want you
and Tonya in your seats

11:34.494 --> 11:36.129
clapping for me at 4:00.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.230
4:00?
Yeah,

11:37.264 --> 11:38.832
that's what time
the fashion show starts.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.367
Why, you got something better
to do?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.735
Yeah.
Nah.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.070
Okay.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.073
I didn't know how I was gonna
be in two places at once,

11:46.106 --> 11:48.942
but I wasn't gonna risk
blowing it with Tasha.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.244
By the time we got to church,
the hat show hadn't started,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.280
but the competition
was already on...

11:53.313 --> 11:55.048
:
Praise the Lord. Hi, girl.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.817
I saved you all
some seats.
Okay.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.051
Go in.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.452
Praise the Lord,
Brother Brown.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.488
How you been?
All right.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.828
Girl, I have not seen you
in a month of Sundays.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.896
How you been?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.130
Sinning.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.433
(2001: A Space Odyssey
theme playing)

12:17.838 --> 12:19.840
:
Hi.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.816
Sister Rochelle.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.418
Sister Hattie.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.320
Imagine what they would have
called each other

12:33.353 --> 12:35.322
if they weren't in church.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.858
Happy Easter, everybody.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.292
ALL:
Happy Easter.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.963
Can the church say Amen?

12:42.996 --> 12:44.464
ALL:
Amen.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.333
Let me get a hallelujah.
ALL:
Hallelujah!

12:46.366 --> 12:48.068
Praise the Lord!
ALL:
Praise the Lord!

12:48.101 --> 12:49.803
All right.

12:49.837 --> 12:50.470
Hey, baby...

12:50.503 --> 12:51.805
I have to go
to work,

12:51.839 --> 12:52.505
so I'll see you all after.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.373
Okay, baby.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.507
But since I'm making
a little more money,

12:54.541 --> 12:55.508
you don't have to cook.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.509
So buy a plate
for everybody.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.978
Nice touch.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.179
Hey, Mom,

12:59.212 --> 13:00.848
me and Tonya are gonna go get
a head start on the egg hunt.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.183
Okay, I want you back
by 4:00 though.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.153
We will.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.989
So, I guess it's just
me and you, Drew.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.191
Yeah, I guess so.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.027
Where you going?

13:14.061 --> 13:16.897
I'm gonna meet Tasha
in Queens.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.366
I'm gonna tell on you.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.034
What about all those eggs
you snuck in?

13:21.068 --> 13:23.470
You don't tell on me,
I won't tell on you.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.505
Fine.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.009
When a good plan falls apart,

13:29.042 --> 13:30.477
you usually have no idea
it did...

13:30.510 --> 13:31.912
until it's too late.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.048
Oh! What happened?

13:35.082 --> 13:37.017
I was doing Prince splits
and I hurt my ankle.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.152
Oh, no. What are
we gonna do?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.988
We should take him
to the hospital.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.222
No, I'm talking
about the hat show.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.057
Who's gonna
escort me?

13:44.091 --> 13:45.893
Well, if you want to quit, quit,

13:45.926 --> 13:47.160
but don't bring the children
in it.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.062
What?!

13:49.096 --> 13:51.531
Don't act shocked.
I've seen it all before.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.934
I am not pulling out
of this competition.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.970
So, I suggest that you work
on your second-place smile,

13:57.004 --> 13:58.906
'cause I'm taking this
grand prize home.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.174
Where's Julius?

14:01.208 --> 14:02.375
He left for work.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.911
Ooh, you know what?
Go get Chris.

14:03.944 --> 14:07.314
She was going to get me,
but I was getting Tasha.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.883
Hey.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.184
Chris, you made it.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.353
Told you I would.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.560
By the time I got to Tasha,
not only did I look good,

14:20.593 --> 14:23.030
I was making Robert
look really bad.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.197
You know, my grandmother said

14:24.231 --> 14:25.432
you were just another
no-account Negro

14:25.465 --> 14:26.900
who never
kept his promises

14:26.934 --> 14:28.001
or took care
of his responsibilities,

14:28.035 --> 14:29.937
and would eventually end up
leaving me in the cold

14:29.970 --> 14:31.204
with a runny-nosed baby.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.340
Then we'd be on Jerry Springer.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.909
Nah. I wouldn't do that.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.344
She's probably thinking
about Robert.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.080
Yeah, but I don't want
to talk about him.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.514
Good.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.516
Well, we'd better get going.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.919
Looks like the pageant's going
to start in a little while.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.624
Tonya?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.193
Ooh, where did you
get all those eggs?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.062
Did you hijack
a chicken?

14:55.095 --> 14:57.030
I've just been
looking really hard.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.966
Well, where's Chris?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.400
Think fast, woman.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.235
Uh, he's looking
for eggs.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.971
Well, we need
to find him.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.072
Drew sprained
his ankle,

15:05.105 --> 15:07.207
so he needs to escort your
mother to the hat show.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.042
Come on, girl.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.578
Come on, girl!

15:11.611 --> 15:13.713
Meanwhile, the only thing
my dad was working

15:13.746 --> 15:15.382
was the remote control.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.150
Strike!
Strike?

15:17.184 --> 15:18.151
What are you talking about?

15:18.185 --> 15:19.987
That was low and inside!

15:20.020 --> 15:21.288
Come on.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.124
You got him.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.292
Come on. You got him.

15:25.325 --> 15:29.229
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

15:29.262 --> 15:31.131
Oh, man!

15:31.164 --> 15:34.001
Across town,
Tasha had lost a boyfriend

15:34.034 --> 15:35.602
and won a pageant,

15:35.635 --> 15:37.637
and I was there
to collect the prize.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.009
VANESSA:
What makes you think
he's going to be here?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.577
Well, he wasn't at Doc's or the
playground or the barbershop.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.113
Maybe he's here.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.347
What are y'all doing here?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.449
We're looking for Chris.
What are you doing here?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.284
Where's Chris?
VANESSA:
Well, we don't know,

15:51.318 --> 15:53.286
that's why we're trying
to find him.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.255
Drew sprained his ankle--
there's nobody to be

15:55.288 --> 15:56.289
Rochelle's escort.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.224
I thought you had to work.

15:57.257 --> 16:00.493
I did. I-I just came here
to get changed.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.662
Um... I was just catching
a little bit of the game

16:02.695 --> 16:04.164
before I went in.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.398
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.500
Looks like you caught more than
just a little bit of the game.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.336
TONYA:
Well, somebody needs
to go back to church

16:09.369 --> 16:11.304
and escort Mama
through the hat show,

16:11.338 --> 16:13.073
or we're all going
to get in trouble.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.341
Okay, okay.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.543
We'll just keep this between us.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.046
You, them
and a five dollar bill.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.316
Well, now, this year
our fashion show

16:23.350 --> 16:26.119
has been nothing less
than spectacular.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.320
You got that right!

16:27.354 --> 16:29.056
Now I believe it's the best
hat-off we've had in years.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.224
Does the church agree?

16:31.258 --> 16:33.160
Amen!
Amen!

16:33.193 --> 16:36.329
PREACHER:
Well, I see the judges
have made their decision.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.131
For the past three years,

16:38.165 --> 16:40.667
Sister Rochelle
has swept the competition.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.768
Hallelujah!

16:41.801 --> 16:45.238
But this Easter, our newest
member, Sister Hattie,

16:45.272 --> 16:48.808
brings a wealth of hat expertise
and her awards, too.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.143
Damn.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.112
Oops. I'm sorry.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.616
But this year's winner
and still champ

16:56.649 --> 16:59.186
is Sister Rochelle.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.259
* Her Easter hat
won the hat show *

17:06.293 --> 17:10.230
* Rochelle's new hat,
four years in a row *

17:10.263 --> 17:13.100
* She can't believe
that she beat Hattie *

17:13.133 --> 17:17.204
* This Easter hat is the hat
that made history *

17:17.237 --> 17:19.072
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

17:19.106 --> 17:20.240
* Oh...

17:20.273 --> 17:22.075
Where's Chris?!

17:22.109 --> 17:24.244
Where's Chris?!
Here I am!

17:25.578 --> 17:27.614
* History...

17:27.647 --> 17:30.117
* Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.518
By the end of the day,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.286
I thought it would be different
between me and Tasha.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.223
Hey Chris, thanks for coming
to my pageant with me.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.557
I had a good time.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.226
Me, too.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.228
So, I was thinking,

17:41.261 --> 17:43.563
you want to do something
together sometime?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.166
Robert?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.567
Where's a meteor
when you need one?

17:47.600 --> 17:48.735
I'm sorry.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.802
You should be.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.870
Man, why don't you go somewhere?

17:50.903 --> 17:51.871
She doesn't want to talk to you.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.872
It's okay, Chris.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.873
No, it's not.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.108
I want to hear this.

17:55.142 --> 17:55.942
No, you don't.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.177
I didn't mean
to call you stupid.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.211
Yes, he did.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.212
And I'm sorry.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.247
No, he's not.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.448
For real?

18:01.481 --> 18:02.615
Yes.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.484
No!

18:05.518 --> 18:06.819
Don't do it again.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.155
Ain't this about a...

18:08.188 --> 18:09.522
I heard you won
the Easter pageant.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.590
Yeah, no
thanks to you.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.593
Unfortunately for me,
that was a great Easter,

18:13.626 --> 18:15.728
except the wrong person
came back after three days.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.198
:
That feels good. Mm.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.633
You'll be okay, baby.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.335
I'm proud of you.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.503
I'll go get dinner.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.339
Thank you, baby.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.840
You okay?

18:29.309 --> 18:31.278
Uh, I'll get it.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.846
ROCHELLE:
Hello?

18:33.880 --> 18:34.947
What's wrong with you?

18:34.981 --> 18:38.418
I ate all the candy
I won at the Easter egg hunt.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.487
May I be excused, please?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.356
Go upstairs.
I'll check on you later.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.292
Thank you.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.693
Okay.

18:46.726 --> 18:47.827
DREW:
Hey, Dad.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.397
When you get done, can I have
some more frozen peas?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.165
Frozen peas?

18:52.199 --> 18:54.334
What are you doing
Prince splits for anyway?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.936
Between bandages,
frozen vegetables
Mm-hmm.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.206
and cleaning your suit,
that's $14.86 worth of split.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.275
I'll bring your peas
in a minute.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.277
Okay.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.579
Happy Easter.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.915
Come on in, baby, sit down.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.283
Who was that?

19:10.317 --> 19:11.251
Your job.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.819
It was?

19:12.852 --> 19:13.753
Mm-hmm.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.255
They want you to come in
and work tonight.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.823
They do?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.358
Yeah.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.227
You know, it funny
because I told them

19:20.260 --> 19:21.494
that you just came from work

19:21.528 --> 19:23.230
to escort me
in the Easter hat show.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.865
But they said you hadn't
been to work all day.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.900
Quadruple double overtime, huh?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.803
Hey. What's going on?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.272
Hey, Chris, hey,
how you doing?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.606
Oh, you must be hungry.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.842
Look, um, there's extra
'cause Tonya's sick.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.310
Come on, Drew.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.511
I can't walk.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.380
Oh, we'll bring you some later.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.948
I'll get it.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.583
JULIUS:
You sure?

19:43.616 --> 19:45.385
Yes, I'm sure.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.420
You've worked enough today.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.591
Oh, hi, Tasha.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.293
Hi. Is Chris here?

19:53.326 --> 19:56.263
He is, but we're
having dinner at the moment.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.364
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.266
I just wanted to drop
these pictures off for him.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.301
And...

20:01.334 --> 20:02.602
thanks for letting Chris
come to Queens

20:02.635 --> 20:04.304
and escort me
in the Easter pageant.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.441
You are so welcome.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.742
And thank you.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.444
Happy Easter.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.445
You, too.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.946
Okay.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.786
Chris...!

20:19.819 --> 20:21.888
* Everybody hates Chris.
