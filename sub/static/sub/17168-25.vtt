Beast Boy, your sadness
is leaking from your eyeholes.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.831
(PANTING) It's just...

00:32.833 --> 00:36.968
I can't afford the birthday
present Cyborg really wants!

00:36.970 --> 00:39.571
Wait, haven't we been
through this before?

00:39.573 --> 00:42.040
And besides, my birthday
is like months away.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.242
If I don't get him
an expensive gift,

00:44.244 --> 00:46.411
it can ruin our friendship.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.713
That's not true!

00:47.715 --> 00:49.247
What kind of person
do you think I am?

00:49.249 --> 00:52.117
Yeah, yeah, this has
definitely happened before.

00:52.119 --> 00:56.054
You guys know how much
he loves expensive gifts.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.457
You're making me sound
like a monster!

00:58.459 --> 01:00.492
I have to gets a job,
so I can afford

01:00.494 --> 01:03.061
the expensive presents
Cyborg wants!

01:03.063 --> 01:04.262
You don't!

01:04.264 --> 01:05.964
You really don't!

01:05.966 --> 01:08.867
Let me guess, Beast Boy,
you're going to get a job
at the pie shop.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.536
I ain't getting a job
at the pie shop.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.405
I'm gonna make money
the easy way.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.407
-Check it!
-Wait.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.443
This is a pyramid scheme!

01:18.445 --> 01:22.013
Whoa, pyramid, as in mummies?

01:22.015 --> 01:24.349
I'm not sure you should
do business with mummies.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.284
Not that kind of pyramid!

01:26.286 --> 01:28.520
(INHALES DEEPLY)
A pyramid scheme is an
unsustainable business model,

01:28.522 --> 01:30.455
that promises payments
to participants,

01:30.457 --> 01:32.624
based on the amount
of additional people
they enroll in the business,

01:32.626 --> 01:34.760
instead of focusing on
the sale of goods
or services to the public.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.861
-(BELL DINGING)
-ALL: Ah!

01:35.863 --> 01:37.863
STARFIRE: Oh...
CYBORG: Mmm-hmm.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.399
As you can see here,
the exponential growth
of the "business",

01:40.401 --> 01:42.868
will eventually cause
the entire operation
to collapse,

01:42.870 --> 01:45.570
leaving the participants
at the bottom of
the pyramid bankrupt,

01:45.572 --> 01:47.272
<i>while those at the top</i>
<i>walk away rich.</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:50.275
Thus, the name
"pyramid scheme".

01:50.277 --> 01:51.710
Interesting.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.512
I do have the question.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.614
Did the mummies build
the pyramids?

01:55.616 --> 01:56.648
(YELLING)
There are no mummies!

01:56.650 --> 01:58.917
It's not a literal pyramid!

01:58.919 --> 02:02.020
My point is there's no
such thing as easy money.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.890
You need to earn it
with hard labor.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.158
Ew, no way!

02:06.160 --> 02:08.927
Hard labor is for criminals
and pregnant ladies.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.863
But, if you lives on the top
with the mummy,

02:11.865 --> 02:13.632
you can get rich!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.167
Well, technically, yes, but...

02:15.169 --> 02:18.003
Cyborg is gonna get the most
expensive present ever!

to Beast Boy?

02:33.187 --> 02:35.020
He was eating a cash salad,

02:35.022 --> 02:38.390
and I refuse to stand by
and watch money being wasted.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.158

02:40.160 --> 02:42.060
-Any good?
-Hmm, not really.

are worthless.
