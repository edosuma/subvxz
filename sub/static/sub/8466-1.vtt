00:17.810 --> 00:20.269
It is a beautiful day in Chicago today.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.939
Temperatures expected
to reach the upper 70s.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.400
Right now, 75 at the lakefront,

00:25.484 --> 00:28.069
74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.363
And now, up in the sky,

00:31.156 --> 00:32.990
- Don Nelson with SkyView traffic.
- Ferris?

00:33.075 --> 00:35.284
- Thanks. We've got scores of accidents.
- Ferris?

00:35.369 --> 00:36.452
Tom!

00:39.581 --> 00:41.332
- What's the matter?
- It's Ferris.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.292
- What? What's wrong?
- What's wrong? For Christ's sake

00:43.377 --> 00:45.169
look at him, honey.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.797
Ferris?

00:50.968 --> 00:54.887
He doesn't have a fever, but he says his
stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.848
What's the matter, Ferris?

00:57.933 --> 00:58.975
Papa?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.769
Honey, feel his hands.
They're cold and clammy.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.609
I'm fine.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.945
- I can get up.
- No.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.613
- I have a test today.
- No.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.532
You...

01:14.616 --> 01:17.160
I have to take it.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.538
I want to go to a good college,
so I can have a fruitful life.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.124
Honey, you're not going
to school like this, now.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.710
Fine. What's this? What's his problem?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.839
- He doesn't feel well.
- Yeah, right.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.008
Dry that one out,
you can fertilize the lawn.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.594
Jeanie? Is that you?

01:36.013 --> 01:38.765
Jeanie? I can't see that far.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.560
Jeanie? Jeanie, I...

01:46.023 --> 01:49.609
- Bite the big one, Junior.
- Thank you, Jeanie. You get to school.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.195
Wait, you're letting him stay home?

01:52.529 --> 01:54.614
I can't believe this.
If I was bleeding out my eyes

01:54.698 --> 01:57.283
you guys would make me go to school.
This is so unfair.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.994
Jeanie, please don't be upset with me.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.371
You have your health. Be thankful.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.253
That's it. I want out of this family.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.926
I'm okay. I'll just sleep.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.805
Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.724
Now, listen,
I'm showing some houses to that,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.143
that family from Vermont today.
So I'll be in the area.

02:24.228 --> 02:27.814
Now, my office will know just where
I am if you need me, okay?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.816
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.651
I'll check on you too, pal.

02:31.735 --> 02:36.072
It's nice to know
that I have such loving, caring parents.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.783
You're both very special people.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.832
Now, you get better, pumpkin.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.959
Okay, pumpkin.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.670
I'll be home at 6:00 sharp.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.172
If you need anything, call.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.049
Ringy-dingy.

02:58.095 --> 03:01.180
- We love you, sweetie.
- I love you, too.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.935
Call if you need us.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.653
They bought it.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.456
Incredible.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.667
One of the worst performances
of my career

03:29.751 --> 03:32.128
and they never doubted it for a second.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.262
How could I possibly be expected
to handle school on a day like this?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.649
This is my ninth sick day this semester.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.153
It's getting pretty tough
coming up with new illnesses.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.740
If I go for 10, I'm probably
gonna have to barf up a lung.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.825
So I better make this one count.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.997
The key to faking out the parents
is the clammy hands.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.667
It's a good non-specific symptom.
I'm a big believer in it.

04:12.878 --> 04:16.589
A lot of people will tell you that
a good, phony fever is a dead lock.

04:16.673 --> 04:21.093
But, you get a nervous mother,
you could wind up in a doctor's office.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.179
That's worse than school.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.348
You fake a stomach cramp

04:26.016 --> 04:29.560
and when you're bent over,
moaning and wailing,

04:29.645 --> 04:31.187
you lick your palms.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.439
It's a little childish and stupid,

04:33.523 --> 04:34.941
but then, so is high school.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.611
Life moves pretty fast.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.742
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.206
I do have a test today.
That wasn't bullshit.

04:51.208 --> 04:55.002
It's on European socialism.
I mean, really, what's the point?

04:55.087 --> 04:58.381
I'm not European.
I don't plan on being European.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.758
So, who gives a crap
if they're socialists?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.468
They could be fascist anarchists.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.721
It still wouldn't change the fact
that I don't own a car.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.117
It's not that I condone fascism

05:26.410 --> 05:28.119
or any "ism," for that matter.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.579
"Isms," in my opinion, are not good.

05:30.956 --> 05:34.667
A person should not believe in an "ism,"
he should believe in himself.

05:34.751 --> 05:39.213
I quote John Lennon, "I don't believe
in Beatles, I just believe in me."

05:39.464 --> 05:42.758
A good point there.
After all, he was "The Walrus."

05:43.510 --> 05:47.096
I could be "The Walrus."
I'd still have to bum rides off of people.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.974
- Adams?
- Here.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.934
- Adamley?
- Here.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.270
Adamowsky?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.313
- Adamson?
- Here.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.191
- Adler?
- Here.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.401
Anderson?

06:01.445 --> 06:03.529
- Anderson?
- Here.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.072
Bueller?

06:07.826 --> 06:08.826
Bueller?

06:10.328 --> 06:11.328
Bueller?

06:12.789 --> 06:15.374
- Bueller?
- He's sick.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.878
My best friend's sister's
boyfriend's brother's girlfriend

06:18.962 --> 06:21.047
heard from this guy
who knows this kid, who's going

06:21.131 --> 06:24.550
with a girl who saw Ferris pass out
at Thirty-One Flavors last night.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.427
I guess it's pretty serious.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.930
- Thank you, Simone.
- No problem whatsoever.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.601
Frye? Frye?

06:35.645 --> 06:37.188
Frye?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.655
Hello?

06:47.240 --> 06:51.160
- Cameron, babe, what's happening?
- Very little.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.997
- How do you feel?
- Shredded.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.041
Is your mother in the room?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.629
She's in Decatur.
Unfortunately, she's not staying.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.715
Where are you?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.927
I'm taking the day off.
Now get dressed and come on over.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.054
I can't, stupid, I'm sick.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.223
That's all in your head.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.432
Come on over.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.894
I feel like complete shit, Ferris.
I can't go anywhere.

07:17.145 --> 07:21.190
I'm sorry to hear that.
Now come on over here and pick me up.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.661
I'm dying.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.378
You're not dying. You just
can't think of anything good to do.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.801
If anybody needs a day off,
it's Cameron.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.721
He has a lot of things to sort out
before he graduates.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.849
He can't be wound up this tight
and go to college.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.392
His roommate will kill him.

07:56.476 --> 08:01.230
When Cameron was in Egypt's land

08:02.941 --> 08:07.153
Let my Cameron go

08:08.029 --> 08:10.531
Pardon my French,
but Cameron is so tight

08:10.740 --> 08:12.992
that if you stuck
a lump of coal up his ass,

08:13.076 --> 08:14.952
in two weeks you'd have a diamond.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.668
Katie Bueller.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.254
This is Edward R. Rooney,
Dean of Students.

08:25.422 --> 08:29.425
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.303
I just completely forgot to call.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.514
Then you are aware that your son
is not in school today?

08:35.599 --> 08:37.975
Yes, I am. Ferris is home, sick.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.684
Now, I had a meeting
first thing this morning.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.438
I know I should have called,
it just completely slipped my mind.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.315
I'm really very sorry.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.026
Are you also aware, Mrs. Bueller, that

08:47.110 --> 08:49.862
Ferris does not have
what we consider to be

08:49.946 --> 08:52.031
an exemplary attendance record?

08:52.449 --> 08:53.908
I don't understand.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.036
He has missed an unacceptable number
of school days.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.205
In the opinion of this educator,

08:59.289 --> 09:02.041
Ferris is not taking
his academic growth seriously.

09:02.918 --> 09:06.587
Now, I've spent my morning
examining his records.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.799
If Ferris thinks that
he can just coast through this month

09:10.926 --> 09:13.969
and still graduate,
he is sorely mistaken.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.389
I have no reservation, whatsoever,

09:17.557 --> 09:20.476
about holding him back another year.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.481
- This is all news to me.
- Usually is.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.402
So far this semester
he has been absent nine times.

09:31.947 --> 09:35.407
- Nine times?
- Nine times.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.952
I don't remember him
being sick nine times.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.914
That's probably because he wasn't sick,
he was skipping school.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.709
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Mrs. Bueller.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.086
It's a fool's paradise.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.256
He is just leading you
down the primrose path.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.590
I can't believe it.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.968
I've got it right here in front of me.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.845
He has missed nine days.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.439
I asked for a car, I got a computer.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.109
How's that
for being born under a bad sign?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.528
Grace?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.283
Grace!

10:17.409 --> 10:20.536
Look, I can give you every assurance,
Mr. Rooney, that Ferris is home

10:20.620 --> 10:22.079
and he is very ill.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.707
In fact, I debated whether or not
I should even leave him.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.958
Grace!

10:26.042 --> 10:29.586
I can appreciate how this time of year
children are prone to taking the day off.

10:29.671 --> 10:34.550
However, in Ferris' case, I can
assure you, he is truly a very sick boy.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.557
Never had one lesson.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.312
In 1930,

10:46.396 --> 10:49.315
the Republican-controlled
House of Representatives,

10:49.399 --> 10:52.151
in an effort
to alleviate the effects of the...

10:52.485 --> 10:55.696
Anyone? Anyone?
The Great Depression,

10:56.197 --> 10:59.867
passed the... Anyone? Anyone?

11:00.452 --> 11:05.205
The tariff bill,
the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act which...

11:06.499 --> 11:08.417
Anyone? Raised or lowered?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.544
Raised tariffs

11:10.837 --> 11:14.381
in an effort to collect more revenue
for the federal government.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.926
Did it work? Anyone?
Anyone know the effects?

11:18.678 --> 11:22.765
It did not work and the United States
sank deeper into the Great Depression.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.684
Today, we have
a similar debate over this.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.937
Anyone know what this is?
Class? Anyone?

11:29.606 --> 11:30.606
Anyone?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.358
Anyone seen this before?

11:32.609 --> 11:35.152
The Laffer Curve.
Anyone know what this says?

11:35.737 --> 11:39.990
It says, that at this point
on the revenue curve,

11:40.158 --> 11:42.993
you will get exactly
the same amount of revenue

11:43.953 --> 11:45.371
as at this point.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.872
This is very controversial.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.793
Does anyone know what Vice President
Bush called this in 1980?

11:51.086 --> 11:52.336
Anyone?

11:53.129 --> 11:55.464
Something "d-o-o" economics.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.674
Voodoo economics.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.938
Jeanie.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.232
I'm really sorry about your brother.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.151
What are you sorry for?
I have to live with the trouser snake.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.487
No, I mean, I heard he's really sick.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.823
Whoa. Whoa. Who said he's sick?

12:20.907 --> 12:24.118
A whole bunch of people. They said
he's like on the verge of death.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.994
This guy in my biology class

12:26.079 --> 12:30.332
said that if Ferris dies,
he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.419
He's such a sweetie. Got to go.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.505
- Hi, Jeanie.
- Shut up.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.510
Please, do not yank my cord on this.
How desperate is the situation?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.345
Well, did you see Alien?

12:44.055 --> 12:46.682
When that creature
was in that guy's stomach?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.060
It kind of feels like that.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.520
Freshmen.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.938
Goddamn, are you kidding?

12:53.022 --> 12:56.275
No, of course I'm not kidding.
Do I sound like I'm kidding?

12:56.693 --> 12:57.776
Who's he talking to?

12:57.861 --> 12:59.069
Ferris Bueller, do you know him?

12:59.154 --> 13:00.863
Yeah. He's getting me
out of summer school.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.990
We appreciate you letting us know
how you're doing.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.783
We've got to buzz.
Keep a good thought, dude.

13:04.868 --> 13:05.951
Thanks.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.829
Shit. I hope he doesn't die.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.789
I can't handle summer school.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.168
- Wait a minute, give me somebody else.
- Yeah, sure, hold on.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.380
- You see Alien?
- Yeah, why?

13:21.092 --> 13:23.177
- Hello?
- Hi.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.220
Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

13:26.431 --> 13:28.599
Oh, my God, you're dying?

13:33.062 --> 13:35.814
- Is it serious?
- I don't know. I hope not.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.027
- Think I may need a kidney transplant.
- Shit.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.448
- Are you upset?
- Excuse me.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.910
- Think you'll be alive this weekend?
- Yeah, I'd say I will.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.995
Great. Maybe I'll see you. Bye.

14:05.136 --> 14:09.932
I don't trust this kid
any further than I can throw him.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.810
Well, with your bad knee, Ed,
you shouldn't throw anybody.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.397
It's true.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.984
What is so dangerous about a character
like Ferris Bueller is

14:21.069 --> 14:23.362
he gives good kids bad ideas.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.198
The last thing I need
at this point in my career is

14:26.282 --> 14:29.826
1,500 Ferris Bueller disciples
running around these halls.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.248
He jeopardizes my ability
to effectively govern this student body.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.960
Well, makes you look like an ass
is what he does, Ed.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.380
Thank you, Grace. I think you're wrong.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.465
Well, he's very popular, Ed.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.802
The sportos and motorheads,
geeks, sluts,

14:47.053 --> 14:50.305
bloods, wasteoids,
dweebies, dickheads,

14:50.390 --> 14:51.890
they all adore him.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.059
They think he's a righteous dude.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.689
That is why
I have got to catch him this time.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.567
To show these kids
that the example he sets

15:01.651 --> 15:03.986
is a first-class ticket to nowhere.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.238
Ed.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.074
You sounded like Dirty Harry just then.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.367
Really?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.250
Thanks, Grace.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.669
I'm serious, man, this is ridiculous.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.546
Making me
wait around the house for you.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.339
Why can't you let me rot in peace?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.675
Cameron, this is my ninth sick day.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.760
If I get caught, I won't graduate.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.555
I'm not doing this for me,
I'm doing it for you.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.391
- Do you know what my diastolic is?
- Be a man.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.477
Take some Pepto-Bismol,
get dressed, and come on over here.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.980
- I'm tired of this stuff.
- Shut up.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.692
Hold your water for a second,
I got another call.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.487
- Hello?
- Ferris?

15:47.572 --> 15:48.822
Hi.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.616
You sound terrible.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.535
Really? Darn. I thought I was improving.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.203
Were you sleeping?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.873
Dad, can you hang on for a second?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.500
- Sure, pal.
- Hang on.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.545
- Cameron, it's my dad.
- Great.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.130
Keep me out of it.

16:05.214 --> 16:09.051
If you're not over here in 15 minutes,
you can find a new best friend.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.220
You've been saying that
since the fifth grade.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.432
- Dad?
- Yeah?

16:15.516 --> 16:18.393
All this talking
has made me kind of light-headed.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.562
I think I ought to lie down.

16:20.897 --> 16:24.232
Take a hot bath and then
wrap a hot towel around your head.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.361
- Wrap a hot towel around my head?
- And then

16:27.820 --> 16:30.656
make yourself some soup.
Get a nap. Okay?

16:30.740 --> 16:31.907
Okay.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.075
- Hey, Ferris?
- Yeah?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.661
- Love you, pal.
- I love you, too.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.917
I'm so disappointed in Cameron.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.671
$20 says he's sitting in his car, debating
about whether or not he should go out.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.259
He'll keep calling me.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.679
He'll keep calling me until I come over.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.681
He'll make me feel guilty.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.016
This...

16:58.101 --> 17:02.437
This is ridiculous.
Okay, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.855
Shit.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.280
Goddamn it!

17:21.624 --> 17:23.500
Forget it. That's it.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.171
I'm not going.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.313
In

17:47.316 --> 17:50.318
what way

17:52.530 --> 17:55.323
does the author's use

17:55.700 --> 17:58.201
of the prison

18:02.123 --> 18:04.082
symbolize

18:13.676 --> 18:16.970
the protagonist's struggle? And

18:17.555 --> 18:19.347
how does this relate

18:19.807 --> 18:22.976
to our discussion of the uses of irony?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.648
Mr. Knowlan, may I interrupt, please?

18:35.198 --> 18:36.907
Sloane Peterson?

18:38.242 --> 18:40.368
May I have a word with you, dear?

18:42.038 --> 18:46.875
My dear, I'm afraid
that I'm the bearer of bad tidings.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.252
Your father called.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.756
Your grandmother has just passed.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.929
- No.
- Oh, darling. Oh, honey.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.058
Dead grandmother?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.560
Yes, that's what Mr. Peterson said.

19:06.020 --> 19:09.856
I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.
Poor little lamb.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.651
Who's this girl going out with?

19:12.944 --> 19:15.111
It's so hard to tell these days.

19:15.530 --> 19:18.406
I do see her
with Ferris Bueller quite a little bit.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.286
Would you get me
Mr. Peterson's daytime number, please?

19:23.371 --> 19:24.746
Surely.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.126
- Ed Rooney's office.
- This is George Peterson.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.088
Please hold.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.382
What do you know? It's Mr. Peterson.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.261
You still want his daytime number?

19:44.225 --> 19:47.602
- Ed Rooney.
- Ed. This is George Peterson.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.688
How are you today, sir?

19:49.772 --> 19:53.358
We've had a bit of bad luck
this morning, as you may have heard.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.778
Yeah, I heard, and I'm all broken up.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.490
- Boy, what a blow.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.701
Well, it's been a tough morning, and

20:02.785 --> 20:05.787
we've got a lot of family business
to take care of. So

20:05.872 --> 20:09.374
if you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane,
I'd appreciate it.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.877
Sure, I'd be happy to.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.297
Yeah, you just produce a corpse, and

20:15.673 --> 20:17.173
I'll release Sloane.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.510
I want to see this
dead grandmother, firsthand.

20:20.595 --> 20:21.595
Ed?

20:21.929 --> 20:24.931
It's all right, Grace.
It's Ferris Bueller, the little twerp.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.934
I'm gonna set the trap
and let him fall right into it.

20:29.103 --> 20:33.189
Ed, I'm sorry, did you say
you wanted to see a body?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.233
Yeah, that's right.

20:35.318 --> 20:39.362
Just roll her old bones on over here,
and I'll dig up your daughter.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.448
- You know, that's school policy.
- Oh?

20:41.657 --> 20:44.951
- Was this your mother?
- No, my wife's mother.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.080
Ed Rooney's office.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.250
Hi, this is Ferris Bueller,
can I speak to Mr. Rooney, please?

20:52.335 --> 20:53.501
Thank you.

20:56.339 --> 20:57.631
Hold.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.259
Tell you what, dip-shit,

21:01.594 --> 21:04.930
you don't like my policies
you can just come on down here, and

21:05.014 --> 21:07.682
smooch my big old white butt.

21:08.017 --> 21:11.144
- Ed.
- Pucker up, buttercup. What?

21:11.479 --> 21:13.355
Ferris Bueller's on line two.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.117
Hey, Mr. Rooney, how you doing?

21:26.202 --> 21:29.746
Listen, I'm sorry to disturb you at work,
but I'm not feeling very well today

21:29.830 --> 21:32.958
and I was wondering if it might be
possible for my sister to bring home

21:33.042 --> 21:35.877
any assignments from my classes
that I might need.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.545
Have a nice day.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.478
Mr. Peterson?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.816
I think I owe you an apology, sir.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.652
- Well, I should say you do.
- I...

22:01.112 --> 22:02.404
I, I, I...

22:02.488 --> 22:05.323
Well, I think you should be sorry,
for Christ's sake.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.158
A family member dies

22:07.243 --> 22:10.704
and you insult me. What the hell
is the matter with you anyway?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.039
Well...

22:13.124 --> 22:14.582
I really don't know, sir.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.501
I mean, I didn't think
I was talking to you.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.003
I thought I was talking
to somebody else.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.464
You know, sir, that I would never
deliberately insult you like that. I...

22:21.549 --> 22:24.968
I can't begin to tell you
how embarrassed I am.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.470
- What?
- Pardon my French,

22:27.555 --> 22:28.888
but you're an asshole.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.099
- What do you want?
- Asshole.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.477
Absolutely right, sir.
You've hit the nail right on the head.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.104
Find out where she is.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.773
This isn't over yet, buster.
Do you read me?

22:38.941 --> 22:41.026
Loud and clear, Mr. Peterson.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.236
Call me "sir," goddamn it!

22:43.320 --> 22:46.281
- Yes, sir, yes, sir.
- That's better.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.326
And you just mind
your p's and q's, buster.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.662
And remember who you're dealing with.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.540
Bueller, Ferris Bueller.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.462
Now, I'm a little scared 'cause
what if he recognizes my voice?

23:00.546 --> 23:03.548
- Impossible. You're doing great.
- Yeah?

23:06.635 --> 23:09.054
She's in... Wait.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.140
Rooney!

23:14.477 --> 23:16.227
Rooney, calm down!

23:16.312 --> 23:17.645
Just a moment.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.315
Ed! Get in here!

23:22.026 --> 23:24.402
Just a little office difficulty, sir.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.071
Rooney, I don't have all day
to bark at you.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.656
So I'm gonna make this
short and sweet.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.283
It's great. Perfect. I love it.

23:30.367 --> 23:34.829
I want my daughter out in front of the
school in 10 minutes by herself.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.706
I don't want anybody... What?

23:36.791 --> 23:38.666
It's too suspicious.
He'll think something's up.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.751
- Cover it.
- You.

23:39.835 --> 23:40.960
- Talk.
- You.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.337
- Talk.
- Come on.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.714
Talk. No.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.217
Rooney! Rooney.

23:47.301 --> 23:48.551
Yes, yes.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.346
Listen here, pay attention.
I changed my mind.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.848
I want you out
in front of the school with her.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.392
I'd like to have a few words with you,
by God.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.730
On second thought,
we don't have time to talk right now.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.358
We'll get together soon
and we'll have lunch.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.693
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:07.279 --> 24:08.655
Wait.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.115
- Where's your brain?
- Why'd you kick me?

24:10.199 --> 24:11.741
- Where's your brain?
- Why'd you kick me?

24:11.826 --> 24:14.202
- Where's your brain?
- I asked you first.

24:15.079 --> 24:18.123
How can we pick up Sloane
if Rooney is there with her?

24:20.376 --> 24:23.461
I said for her to be there alone
and you freaked.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.635
Now, I didn't... I didn't hit you.
I lightly slapped you.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.554
You hit me.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.351
Look, don't ask me
to participate in your stupid crap

24:38.435 --> 24:40.562
if you don't like the way I do it.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.275
You make me get out of bed.
You make me come over here.

24:45.359 --> 24:48.403
You make me make a phony phone call
to Edward Rooney?

24:50.322 --> 24:53.616
The man could squash my nuts
into oblivion, and then,

24:53.826 --> 24:56.077
and then,
you deliberately hurt my feelings.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.372
No, I did not deliberately...
I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.958
- Really?
- Really, no. No, I didn't.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.254
What are you doing?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.006
See you later, pal, I'm going home.

25:08.090 --> 25:11.050
- No, no, come on, don't do that.
- Have a nice life.

25:11.427 --> 25:14.262
Cameron, wait a minute.
Cameron, come back.

25:14.346 --> 25:18.349
I didn't mean to lose my temper.
I'm sorry. It was uncalled for.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.853
- You serious?
- Yeah.

25:29.653 --> 25:30.987
Here you go.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.574
Thank you.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.995
You did screw up, though, right?

25:42.166 --> 25:45.168
I mean, not that it was
completely your fault.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.630
- Why?
- Well,

25:49.757 --> 25:51.758
to fix the situation

25:52.092 --> 25:54.636
I'm gonna have to
ask you for a small favor.

26:11.862 --> 26:16.407
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.538
Less than 100 were made.

26:23.499 --> 26:26.167
My father spent
three years restoring this car.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.505
It is his love, it is his passion...

26:30.839 --> 26:33.841
It is his fault he didn't lock the garage.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.179
Ferris, what are you talking about?

26:42.017 --> 26:44.936
Ferris, my father loves this car
more than life itself.

26:45.020 --> 26:49.357
A man with priorities so far out of whack
doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.403
No. No.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.448
- Apparently you don't understand.
- Wow.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.701
Ferris, he never drives it.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.120
He just rubs it with a diaper.

27:03.872 --> 27:07.208
Hey, remember how insane he went
when I broke my retainer?

27:08.794 --> 27:12.255
Come on, that was a little piece
of plastic, this is a Ferrari.

27:15.884 --> 27:19.512
Cameron, I'm sorry,
but we can't pick up Sloane in your car.

27:19.596 --> 27:23.391
Mr. Rooney would never believe
Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.395
- It's not a piece of shit.
- It is a piece of shit.

27:27.938 --> 27:31.774
Don't worry about it, I don't even have
a piece of shit, I have to envy yours.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.151
Thanks.

27:34.737 --> 27:38.573
Look, I'm sorry,
there's nothing else we can do.

27:50.419 --> 27:53.755
- He knows the mileage, Ferris.
- He doesn't trust you?

27:54.048 --> 27:57.759
- Never has, never will.
- Look, this is real simple.

27:57.843 --> 28:01.095
Whatever miles we put on,
we'll take off.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.598
- How?
- We'll drive home backwards.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.060
No. No!

28:07.144 --> 28:10.355
Ferris, forget it. You're just gonna
have to think of something else.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.148
I'm putting my foot down.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.777
How about we rent a nice Cadillac?
My treat.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.155
We could call a limo!

28:20.532 --> 28:23.284
A nice stretch job with a TV and a bar.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.744
How about that?

28:28.457 --> 28:30.124
Come on, live a little.

28:34.296 --> 28:37.924
Once again, let me tell you how deeply
saddened I am by your loss. I...

28:38.175 --> 28:40.134
I had a grandmother, once.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.554
Two, actually.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.100
Deficits. Who will have to pay that
eventually? Anyone? Anyone know?

28:47.476 --> 28:50.520
"Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live

28:50.604 --> 28:52.188
"and is full of misery

28:52.606 --> 28:55.775
"He cometh up
and is cut down like a flow'r

28:56.402 --> 28:58.569
"He flee'th as if it were a shadow

28:58.654 --> 29:01.739
"and never continueth in one stay"

29:04.368 --> 29:05.368
Oh, dear.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.333
Between grief and nothing,

29:13.460 --> 29:14.836
I'll take grief.

29:16.964 --> 29:17.964
Great.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.683
Oh, Sloane, dear.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.018
Hurry along now.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.148
I guess that's my dad.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.150
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.863
Mr. Rooney...

29:43.031 --> 29:47.827
- Ed, you're a beautiful man.
- Thank you.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.540
I wanna thank you
for your warmth and compassion.

29:54.168 --> 29:57.128
Higher "what" rates? Anyone?

29:57.212 --> 30:01.924
Higher marginal rates on your taxes.
Any questions so far?

30:02.134 --> 30:03.217
Shit.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.389
- Hi.
- Do you have a kiss for Daddy?

30:08.515 --> 30:09.932
Are you kidding?

30:20.861 --> 30:23.571
So, that's how it is in their family.

30:28.410 --> 30:32.538
- Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?
- Hi, Sloane. No.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.460
What are we gonna do?

30:37.753 --> 30:40.087
The question isn't:
What are we going to do?

30:40.172 --> 30:42.048
The question is:
What aren't we going to do?

30:42.132 --> 30:43.883
Don't say we're not going
to take the car home.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.177
Please don't say we're not going
to take the car home.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.262
If you had access to a car like this,

30:48.347 --> 30:50.473
would you take it back right away?

30:51.475 --> 30:53.017
Neither would I.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.467
Hey, Ferris, don't go so fast!

31:26.552 --> 31:29.303
- Red line, red line, red line.
- Ferris, get out!

32:28.530 --> 32:29.572
Thank you.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.698
Save Ferris.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.116
God loves you, you're very generous.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.868
Save Ferris, save Ferris.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.787
Save Ferris Bueller. Save Ferris.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.873
- Save Ferris?
- What?

32:39.499 --> 32:42.918
Well, see, we're collecting money
to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

32:43.003 --> 32:45.212
and they run about $50,000,
so if you could help out...

32:45.297 --> 32:48.090
- Go piss up a flagpole.
- I'm sorry?

32:48.592 --> 32:50.134
- You should be.
- Hey...

32:50.218 --> 32:51.844
Hey! Hey...

32:51.928 --> 32:53.220
What if you need a favor someday

32:53.305 --> 32:55.222
from Ferris Bueller?
Then where will you be, huh?

32:55.307 --> 32:56.807
You heartless wench.

32:57.059 --> 32:58.893
Peterson home on line one.

32:59.728 --> 33:03.731
- And watch your mouth this time.
- Go soak your head.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.235
We can't come to the phone right now.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.573
We've had a death in the family.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.116
Grace,

33:14.284 --> 33:17.119
Ferris Bueller's behind this.
There is no doubt in my mind.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.872
And now he's got Sloane Peterson
involved in this thing.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.791
Her grandmother, too.

33:23.377 --> 33:24.669
You pinhead.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.922
If you need to reach us we'll be
at the following number.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.930
Okay.

33:36.056 --> 33:39.433
I did not achieve this position in life
by having some snot-nosed punk

33:39.518 --> 33:41.352
leave my cheese out in the wind.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.105
You have reached
the Coughlin Brothers Mortuary.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.024
We are deeply sorry we are unable
to come to the phone right now,

33:47.109 --> 33:48.776
but if you leave your name and number,

33:48.860 --> 33:51.779
we'll get back to you
as soon as is humanly possible.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.411
Something's going on, goddamn it.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.872
And I'm gonna find out what it is.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.459
I'm gonna catch this kid and I'm gonna
put one hell of a dent in his future.

34:06.753 --> 34:10.965
Fifteen years from now when he looks
back on the ruin his life's become,

34:11.049 --> 34:13.467
he is going to remember
Edward Rooney.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.366
- Wrong.
- What?

34:37.826 --> 34:39.326
Not here.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.163
We're not leaving the car here.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.039
- Why not?
- Because we're not.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.333
I want the car back home
where it belongs, right now.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.418
Come on, let's go.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.504
Cameron, what's gonna happen to it?
It's in a garage.

34:50.797 --> 34:54.007
It could get wrecked, stolen, scratched,

34:54.676 --> 34:57.386
breathed on wrong, a pigeon
could shit on it. Who knows?

34:57.471 --> 34:59.555
Listen, will you calm down, please?

34:59.639 --> 35:01.932
I'm gonna give the guy $5 to watch it.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.476
What guy?

35:10.567 --> 35:12.193
Hey, how you doing?

35:13.195 --> 35:14.695
Do you speak English?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.991
What country do you think this is?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.744
Okay. Listen,

35:21.828 --> 35:25.581
I want you to take extra
special care of this vehicle. Okay?

35:25.665 --> 35:27.374
- Hey, no problem.
- Great.

35:27.501 --> 35:28.876
Trust me.

35:30.003 --> 35:32.213
- Sir?
- Come on.

35:32.798 --> 35:33.798
Come.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.352
Relax.

35:52.359 --> 35:57.071
You fellows have nothing
to worry about. I'm a professional.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.365
Professional what?

36:09.876 --> 36:12.586
See what a finski can do
to a guy's attitude?

36:13.129 --> 36:14.713
Cameron, come on.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.508
Come on, come on.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.895
Paper?

36:32.107 --> 36:34.441
Hey, look at that.

36:43.785 --> 36:44.785
Go! Go!

37:32.584 --> 37:34.209
Bless his little heart.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.848
Nine times.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.771
- Ferris, you think the car's all right?
- Sure.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.690
This is the world's tallest building.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.192
Ferris, I don't feel too good.
Can we leave soon?

38:40.276 --> 38:42.987
1,353 feet up in the air...

38:43.071 --> 38:44.905
Here, climb up on this.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.034
Come on, everybody.

38:49.411 --> 38:50.619
Cameron.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.330
Okay, now

38:53.748 --> 38:56.250
lean forward against the glass like this.

38:59.421 --> 39:00.629
Oh, my God.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.089
Isn’t that great?

39:03.508 --> 39:05.926
The city looks so peaceful from up here.

39:06.428 --> 39:10.097
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.183
I think I see my dad.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.396
We got a lot to do, let's go.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.273
Shit.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.277
The son of a bitch
is down there somewhere.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.885
- You want to get married?
- Sure.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.220
Today?

39:51.473 --> 39:52.890
I'm serious.

39:53.475 --> 39:57.311
- I'm not getting married.
- Why not?

39:57.645 --> 40:00.147
What do you mean, "Why not?"
Think about it.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.816
Well, no, besides being too young,

40:02.901 --> 40:04.651
having no place to live,

40:05.153 --> 40:08.989
you feeling a little awkward about being
the only cheerleader with a husband,

40:09.074 --> 40:11.033
give me one good reason why not.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.661
I'll give you two good reasons why not:
My mother and my father.

40:16.331 --> 40:17.706
They're married
and they hate each other.

40:17.791 --> 40:19.124
You've seen them. Am I right?

40:19.209 --> 40:21.794
- So what?
- Well, it's like that car.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.922
He loves the car. He hates his wife.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.556
Thank you.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.533
Can we please get the hell out of here?

40:53.326 --> 40:55.327
This place gives me the creeps.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.498
Why didn't you tell me
we were coming to a...

41:01.417 --> 41:04.795
- Hello, may I help you?
- You can sure as hell try.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.547
Hi. I'm Abe Froman.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.507
Party of three for 12:00.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.971
Is there a problem?

41:14.055 --> 41:17.266
- You are Abe Froman?
- That's right. I'm Abe Froman.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.393
The sausage king of Chicago?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.564
Yeah. That's me.

41:23.731 --> 41:24.898
Listen, young man,

41:24.983 --> 41:26.817
entre nous, I'm very busy here.

41:26.901 --> 41:30.154
Why don't you take the kids
and go back to the clubhouse?

41:32.282 --> 41:34.825
Are you suggesting
that I'm not who I say I am?

41:34.909 --> 41:37.953
I'm suggesting that you leave
before I have to get snooty.

41:38.037 --> 41:39.621
- Snooty?
- Snotty.

41:39.706 --> 41:42.624
- Snotty?
- Okay, Abe, let's go.

41:42.792 --> 41:46.253
No, I'm not going anywhere.
No, we'd like to be seated.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.922
Listen, young man,
either you take the field trip outside

41:49.007 --> 41:51.758
or I'm going to have to call the police.

41:51.926 --> 41:52.926
The...

41:53.011 --> 41:55.387
- You're gonna call the police on me?
- Yes.

41:55.471 --> 41:58.473
Fine. As a matter of fact,
I'll call them myself.

41:58.558 --> 42:02.436
Yes. Call the police.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.189
This'll be a hoot.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.238
Here, give me the phone.
I have another call.

42:13.323 --> 42:15.324
- No.
- I've had enough of this horsing around.

42:15.408 --> 42:18.285
- Give me the phone back.
- You touch me, I yell, "Rat."

42:18.578 --> 42:20.704
There's another phone
around here somewhere. Find it.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.456
Wonderful.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.126
I weep for the future.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.591
Okay, Ferris,
can we just let it go, please?

42:32.675 --> 42:36.178
Ferris, please. You've gone too far.
You're gonna get busted.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.474
A: You can never go too far.

42:40.558 --> 42:44.144
B: If I'm gonna get busted,
it is not gonna be by a guy like that.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.605
Come on, "Abe."

42:47.106 --> 42:48.649
Ask for Abe Froman.

42:48.733 --> 42:51.985
- Chez Quis, bonjour.
- May I speak to Abe Froman,

42:52.904 --> 42:56.365
- the sausage king of Chicago?
- Abe Froman?

42:56.991 --> 42:59.243
Let me check the restaurant.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.745
Could you describe him for me, please?

43:02.121 --> 43:05.958
Leather jacket,
white T-shirt, sweater vest.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.127
He's devastatingly handsome.

43:10.129 --> 43:13.340
- Hold on one moment.
- Yes, thank you.

43:24.852 --> 43:28.772
Mr. Froman, this is
Sergeant Peterson, Chicago Police.

43:32.402 --> 43:36.321
- I appreciate your understanding.
- Don't think twice.

43:36.990 --> 43:39.241
It's understanding that makes it possible

43:39.325 --> 43:42.369
for people like us
to tolerate a person like yourself.

43:45.581 --> 43:48.041
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

43:51.504 --> 43:53.714
Enjoy your lunch.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.926
Darling, you were wonderful.

44:07.437 --> 44:09.938
Cameron, dear friend,

44:10.023 --> 44:13.900
you thought we wouldn't have any fun.
Shame on you.

44:19.115 --> 44:20.782
Maybe I'm overreacting.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.577
Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.

44:24.245 --> 44:27.748
After all, I got a car. He got a computer.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.125
But still,

44:30.209 --> 44:34.588
why should he get to do whatever
he wants, whenever he wants?

44:35.256 --> 44:37.591
Why should
everything work out for him?

44:38.343 --> 44:40.927
What makes him so goddamn special?

44:42.263 --> 44:43.555
Screw him.

44:43.848 --> 44:47.267
I used to think that my family was
the only one that had weirdness in it.

44:48.144 --> 44:49.770
That used to worry me.

44:50.271 --> 44:53.106
Then I saw
how Cameron's family functioned.

44:53.441 --> 44:55.442
His home life is really twisted.

44:56.778 --> 44:59.946
That's why he's sick all the time.
It really bothers him.

45:00.365 --> 45:03.575
He's the only guy I know
who feels better when he's sick.

45:04.786 --> 45:08.955
If I had to live in that house,
I'd probably pray for disease, too.

45:09.499 --> 45:11.291
The place is like a museum.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.919
It's very beautiful and very cold

45:14.295 --> 45:16.797
and you're not allowed
to touch anything.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.300
Can you appreciate
what it must have been like

45:20.635 --> 45:23.178
for Cameron
to be in that joint as a baby?

45:24.472 --> 45:27.724
I'm actually amazed
that I got the car out of the garage.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.311
I caught Cameron digging the ride
once or twice.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.230
It's good for him.

45:33.314 --> 45:35.565
It teaches him to deal with his fear.

45:37.110 --> 45:39.986
Plus, and I must be honest here,

45:40.113 --> 45:43.615
I love driving it. It is so choice.

45:44.117 --> 45:47.285
If you have the means,
I highly recommend picking one up.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.289
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.582
Mint.

46:04.637 --> 46:07.222
Well, hello, Jeanie.
Who's bothering you now?

46:07.306 --> 46:08.723
Is Mr. Rooney in?

46:08.850 --> 46:11.226
No, I'm sorry, he's not. Can I help you?

46:11.477 --> 46:13.603
I seriously doubt it. When's he back?

46:13.688 --> 46:15.105
I don't know.

46:15.189 --> 46:18.066
He's left the school grounds
on personal business.

46:18.151 --> 46:19.943
What's that supposed to mean?

46:20.027 --> 46:24.030
I suppose it means it's personal and
it's none of your business, young lady.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.033
Nice attitude.

46:27.827 --> 46:30.829
Isn't Mrs. Hagel
expecting you in consumer ed. Class?

46:30.955 --> 46:32.164
Probably.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.172
What a little asshole.

46:40.423 --> 46:43.258
Dave, you've got to consider
raising your advertising budget.

46:43.342 --> 46:44.926
- We don't have the money.
- Dave,

46:45.011 --> 46:48.388
if you wanna sell, you have to spend.
It's as simple as that.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.559
Four thousand restaurants
in the downtown area.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.269
I pick the one my father goes to.

46:54.353 --> 46:56.813
- We're pinched, for sure.
- No way, Cameron.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.566
Only the meek get pinched.
The bold survive.

46:59.942 --> 47:01.193
Let's go.

47:01.402 --> 47:03.778
- Let's surrender.
- Never.

47:09.118 --> 47:11.786
Dave, I know it sounds like
I'm beating a dead horse on this one.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.622
But I'm telling you,
that that's not the case.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.248
We don't have the money.
We don't have the...

47:15.333 --> 47:17.584
Dave, you're one of the
brightest guys in this business.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.462
You know what it takes
to push this over the top.

47:20.922 --> 47:22.672
We're gonna go heavy on TV

47:22.757 --> 47:24.508
and lighten up on the radio
and the print. Okay?

47:24.592 --> 47:26.760
- He's got the money.
- Look, come on back to my office.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.553
- I'll lay out the entire...
- He's got the money.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.639
Dave, we know you've got the money.

47:30.723 --> 47:33.767
We just have to spend it.
That's all, you bonehead.

48:27.029 --> 48:29.072
Bueller.

48:40.293 --> 48:45.672
Les jeux sont faits.
Translation: The game is up.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.341
Your ass is mine.

49:16.162 --> 49:18.538
Runner at first base, nobody out.

49:19.790 --> 49:23.793
That's the first hit they've had
since the fifth inning,

49:23.878 --> 49:26.630
only the fourth hit in the game.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.216
0 and 2, the count.

49:31.010 --> 49:32.260
There's a drive,

49:32.345 --> 49:36.431
left field, twisting, and into foul territory.

49:38.434 --> 49:41.811
Boy, I'm really surprised
they didn't go for it in that inning.

49:41.896 --> 49:43.772
Lee Smith.

49:44.774 --> 49:46.983
- What's the score?
- Nothing, nothing.

49:47.068 --> 49:48.735
Who's winning?

49:50.363 --> 49:51.404
The Bears.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.740
There's the ball,
bunted foul back to the screen.

49:55.284 --> 49:56.326
Boy, I don't know...

50:06.587 --> 50:07.671
Think I broke my thumb.

50:07.755 --> 50:11.591
Hey batter, batter, batter, batter, batter,
swing, batter. Come on.

50:11.884 --> 50:14.969
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter,
swing, batter.

50:15.054 --> 50:18.765
He can't hit, he can't hit, he can't hit,
swing, batter.

50:23.229 --> 50:24.688
Hey, Cameron.

50:25.398 --> 50:28.191
Do you realize if we played by the rules,
right now we'd be in gym?

50:30.778 --> 50:32.612
Keep moving, keep moving.

50:33.239 --> 50:34.239
You're up now.

50:34.323 --> 50:37.075
Come on,
get the piano off that back. Let's go.

50:37.410 --> 50:39.619
Come on, boys, let's go.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.831
You'll never get out of here. Move!

50:45.126 --> 50:46.543
Come on, move!

50:52.425 --> 50:53.967
I hate him.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.177
Who is it?

51:43.642 --> 51:46.978
It's Ed Rooney, Ferris.
I'd like to have a word with you.

51:47.354 --> 51:50.565
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

51:50.733 --> 51:52.776
I'm afraid that
in my weakened condition,

51:52.860 --> 51:55.487
I could take a nasty spill
down the stairs and subject myself

51:55.571 --> 51:57.530
to further school absences.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.158
Save it, Ferris. Come down here.

52:00.242 --> 52:02.827
You can reach my parents
at their places of business.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.413
Thank you for stopping by.

52:05.498 --> 52:08.041
I appreciate your concern
for my well-being.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.961
I am not leaving till you come down
and talk to me, Ferris.

52:12.046 --> 52:13.505
Have a nice day.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.298
You're in big trouble, buster!

52:15.382 --> 52:16.674
Get down here!

52:19.053 --> 52:20.220
Ferris.

52:21.430 --> 52:22.680
Ferris!

52:33.025 --> 52:34.108
Who is it?

52:34.485 --> 52:36.486
You know goddamn well who it is!

52:36.570 --> 52:39.697
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.242
I'm afraid that
in my weakened condition,

52:42.326 --> 52:44.953
I could take a nasty spill
down the stairs and subject myself

52:45.037 --> 52:47.038
to further school absences.

52:48.958 --> 52:51.918
You can reach my parents
at their places of business.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.756
Thank you for stopping by.

52:57.049 --> 52:59.592
I appreciate your concern
for my well-being.

53:00.886 --> 53:02.679
Have a nice day.

53:14.775 --> 53:15.775
Damn it.

53:23.450 --> 53:24.951
Oh, mud.

53:53.230 --> 53:56.107
Bueller, you son of a bitch.

54:05.784 --> 54:06.784
My shoe.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.087
Damn it.

54:22.843 --> 54:24.677
Oh, shit.

55:04.510 --> 55:06.678
Not sure about this family.

55:45.592 --> 55:46.884
Hi, doggie.

55:52.307 --> 55:53.433
Stay, boy.

55:55.269 --> 55:58.312
No, no. Stay. Stay.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.273
Sit.

56:02.860 --> 56:03.860
Sit.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.904
Heel. Stay.

58:05.149 --> 58:07.441
And passing the reviewing stand now,

58:09.111 --> 58:11.696
Silbernen Ritter Drum and Bugle Corps.

58:13.949 --> 58:17.910
The United German-American
Male and Female Caucus.

58:18.036 --> 58:20.246
The Empire German-Americans.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.840
It's getting late, buddy,
we better go get the car back home.

58:30.924 --> 58:31.924
- What?
- What do you...

58:32.009 --> 58:34.135
We have a few hours.
We have until 6:00.

58:34.219 --> 58:37.221
I'm sorry, I mean, I know you
don't care, but it does mean my ass.

58:37.306 --> 58:40.016
- You think I don't care?
- I know you don't care.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.478
Oh, that hurts, Cameron.

58:45.772 --> 58:49.317
- Cameron, what have you seen today?
- Nothing good.

58:50.277 --> 58:51.277
Nothing...

58:51.820 --> 58:54.280
Nothing good? This...

58:54.364 --> 58:57.200
What do you mean, "Nothing good"?
We've seen everything good!

58:57.284 --> 58:59.035
We've seen the whole city!

58:59.494 --> 59:02.330
We went to a museum,
we saw priceless works of art.

59:02.623 --> 59:04.790
We ate pancreas.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.001
Saw... What?

59:07.961 --> 59:09.212
What's wrong?

59:16.011 --> 59:18.804
Look over there.

59:50.671 --> 59:52.046
What's he doing?

59:52.339 --> 59:55.716
He's licking the glass and making
obscene gestures with his hands.

59:55.801 --> 59:56.968
What?

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:06.435
Don't! Don't.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:36.799
He didn't leave.
He's probably doing something.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.135
No, it really busts my hump, you know?

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:42.305
Oh, Cameron, he didn't ditch us
or anything. He's here.

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.557
For all we know,
he went back to school.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.809
He would not go back to school.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.145
Yeah, he'd do it.
He'd just do it just to make me sweat.

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:50.980
No, he would not. Cameron, come on.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.440
Makes me mad.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:55.735
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're such a wonderful crowd.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:57.862
We'd like to play a little tune for you.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:00.156
It's one of my personal favorites

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.241
and I'd like to dedicate it
to a young man

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:05.161
who doesn't think
he's seen anything good today.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.830
Cameron Frye, this one's for you.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:18.716
- Ferris! Get off of the float!
- What are you doing?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.344
Get off the float! I can't believe you.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:24.638
How'd you get up there?
You're out of your mind!

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:03.844
You know, as long as I've known him
everything works for him.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:07.765
There's nothing he can't handle.
I can't handle anything.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.769
School, parents, the future...

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.314
Ferris can do anything.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.694
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:26.158
- College.
- Yeah. But to do what?

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.372
What are you interested in?

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:35.543
Nothing.

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:39.046
Me neither.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:47.972
You're crazy!

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.643
What do you think Ferris is gonna do?

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:57.022
He's gonna be a fry cook at Venus.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.243
Christ.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:04.960
Poochie, poochie, poochie.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.714
Look what Uncle Ed has for you,
you little fucker.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:16.972
Jeez.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.440
Sleep tight, pooch.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:53.967
I knew it!

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.105
Well, where is she?

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.941
Look, this is her daughter.

01:07:13.405 --> 01:07:15.406
Well, do you know where she is?

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.741
Do you know when she'll be back?

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.743
Do you know anything?

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:11.295
Ferris.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.005
Bueller.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:17.009
- Ha!
- Ya!

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.694
You're psychotic. You are, man.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:39.323
You're out of your goddamn mind.
I can't believe you did that.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.533
I can't believe you went
on a goddamn parade float!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.578
Okay, okay, wait. No, okay, wait. Okay.

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:49.875
"Yeah, yeah. This tune is one of
my personal favorites."

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.877
You're out of your mind.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.712
Do you realize
how many people saw you?

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:54.962
- You're nailed.
- No, no.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:56.298
- You are. You're nailed.
- You are.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:59.091
Who'd believe that I was in a parade?
Who the hell am I?

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.678
Besides, anybody who would nail me
wouldn't go to a parade.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:04.723
- My mother would.
- I'm not worried about your mother.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.475
That was so quick.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:09.770
Hey.

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.439
This looks okay to me, Cameron.

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:15.399
Looks great, let's roll.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:19.238
Here you go. Nice job. Thank you.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:23.200
You're a very generous individual.
Come back anytime.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:26.286
- Right, okay. Watch the seat.
- Thanks a lot.

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:27.703
Sorry.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:35.337
- Have a good night.
- Bye, you guys.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.464
- Yeah, see you later.
- Later.

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:44.011
Yeah, man, we gotta do this again.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.393
Look, this...
This is not a phony phone call.

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:53.604
There is an intruder, male,
Caucasian, possibly armed,

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.275
certainly weird, in my kitchen.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.820
Yeah, my, my... My name's Bueller.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:04.241
It's real nice that
you hope my brother's feeling better,

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.451
but I'm in danger, okay? I am very cute.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.246
I am very alone.
And I'm very protective of my body.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.165
I do not want it violated,
or killed, all right?

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:14.001
I need help!

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.211
Speak-a de English?

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:18.964
Dickhead.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:30.434
God.

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:33.395
Excuse me.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:35.480
Whoever's in the house
is still in the house,

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:38.066
I'd like you to know that
I've just called the police.

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.860
So if you have any brains whatsoever,

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:42.654
you'll get your ass out of
my house real quick.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.658
I'd also like to add
that I have my father's gun

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.744
and a scorching case of herpes.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:00.005
Hey, wait, wait, wait. That's my car!
I'll move it!

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.093
He got my keys!

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.513
You shithead!

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.568
I feel pretty good.

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:23.612
- Yeah?
- I feel real good.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.657
Those guys... Those guys were nice,
huh? At the garage.

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:28.533
I was a little worried about them.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:30.535
Turned out good.

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:36.833
Hey.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.547
- Cameron?
- Yeah?

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:47.302
How many miles did you say
this thing had on it when we left?

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.596
One hundred and twenty-six

01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:51.682
and halfway between
three and four-tenths.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:53.809
Why?

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.396
How many miles are on it now?

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.695
Here's where Cameron goes berserk.

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:27.843
Cameron. Are you okay? Cam?

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.345
Cameron, cut that out.

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:35.017
Who is it?

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.979
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.440
I'm afraid that
in my weakened condition,

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:44.526
I could take a nasty spill
down the stairs and subject myself...

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.528
God bless the police.

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:49.740
I'm saved. Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you, thank you. You are the best.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:51.283
Have a nice day.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.367
Thank...

01:12:52.452 --> 01:12:56.038
I heard that you were feeling ill.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:59.332
Headache, fever, and a chill.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.919
I came to help restore your pluck

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.464
'cause I'm the nurse who likes to...

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.723
This may very well be for real.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.603
I think Cameron might have blown
a microchip or two.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.147
He's always been a little keyed up.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:25.150
All I wanted to do
was give him a good day.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:29.571
We're gonna graduate
in a couple of months and then

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:33.200
we'll have the summer.
He'll work and I'll work.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.245
We'll see each other at night
and on the weekends.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.791
Then he'll go to one school
and I'll go to another.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.835
Basically that will be it.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.091
Sloane's as big a problem.

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:52.761
She still has another year
of high school.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.554
How do I deal with that?

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:58.183
I was serious when I said
I would marry her.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.851
I would.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:02.854
Cameron? Cam?

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.190
Can you hear me?

01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:08.401
Cameron?

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.947
Blink if you understand me.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.866
Cameron has never been in love.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.619
At least nobody's ever been
in love with him.

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:23.375
If things don't change for him,
he's gonna marry the first girl he lays.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.710
And she's gonna treat him like shit

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:30.632
because she will have given him
what he has built up in his mind

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:33.593
as the end-all,
be-all of human existence.

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:35.887
She won't respect him.

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.766
'Cause you can't respect somebody
who kisses your ass.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:42.102
Just doesn't work.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.397
Ferris. We better try something else.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.399
This isn't working.

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.489
You feeling any better, Cameron?

01:14:57.577 --> 01:15:01.371
Cam, why don't you come in here?
It's really nice.

01:15:05.293 --> 01:15:08.003
Cameron, I could flip out real easy, too.

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:09.963
It's okay.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:14.134
Sooner or later
everybody goes to the zoo.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.517
Maybe he's really sick.

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:25.937
Maybe he isn't just torturing himself.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:09.147
Hey.

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:11.942
Hey, hey.

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:13.985
Hey, Cameron.

01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:16.529
Cam. Cameron, wake up!

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.740
Come on, wake up. Hey, wake up.

01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:21.743
Oh, shit, Cameron, come on. Cameron!

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.286
Come on, wake up!

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:24.788
Hey.

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:29.251
What is that?

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:32.170
Ferris Bueller, you're my hero.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:36.007
- You're kidding?
- Wow, that was pretty impressive, man.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.134
You bitch. Oh, you son of a bitch.

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.222
Come on.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.473
Tarzan.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.644
Sheena!

01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:15.588
Drugs?

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.135
Thank you, no. I'm straight.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:23.430
I meant, are you in here for drugs?

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.727
- Why are you here?
- Drugs.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.521
I don't know why I'm here.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.565
Why don't you go home?

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.735
Why don't you put
your thumb up your butt?

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.659
You wear too much eye make-up.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:50.957
My sister wears too much.

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:53.418
People think she's a whore.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.593
You don't wanna
talk about your problem?

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:04.721
- With you? Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:07.057
Blow yourself.

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:14.773
All right,
you wanna know what's wrong?

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.609
I know what's wrong.

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:20.236
I just wanna hear you say it.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.989
In a nutshell, I hate my brother.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.283
- How's that?
- That's cool.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:27.827
Did you blow him away or something?

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.497
No, not yet.

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:35.627
See, I went home
to confirm that the shithead

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.712
was ditching school
and when I was there,

01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:39.297
a guy broke into the house.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:43.093
I called the cops and they picked me up
for making a phony phone call.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:45.929
What do you care
if your brother ditches school?

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:50.183
Why should he get to ditch,
when everybody else has to go?

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:53.853
- You could ditch.
- Yeah, I'd get caught.

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:56.314
I see.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:00.777
So you're pissed off 'cause he ditches
and doesn't get caught, is that it?

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.657
- Basically.
- Basically.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.327
Then your problem is you.

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:12.038
- Excuse me?
- Excuse you.

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:15.250
You ought to spend a little more time
dealing with yourself

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:18.503
a little less time worrying about
what your brother does.

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:20.422
That's just an opinion.

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:23.425
- What are you, a psychiatrist?
- No.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:26.094
Then why don't you keep
your opinions to yourself?

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.517
There's somebody you should talk to.

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:40.567
If you say "Ferris Bueller,"
you lose a testicle.

01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:42.777
Oh, you know him?

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:54.873
You know, that whole time
I was just thinking things over.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:00.545
I was, like... I was, like, meditating.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:06.593
Then I sort of watched myself
from inside.

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:10.889
I realized it was ridiculous

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:16.478
being afraid, worrying about everything,

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:20.106
wishing I was dead. All that shit.
I'm tired of it.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.737
It's the best day of my life.

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.244
I'm gonna miss you guys next year.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:45.924
Cameron? Can I ask you a question?

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:49.052
Yeah.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.265
Did you see me change out
of my clothes by the Jacuzzi?

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:58.269
Did you?

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:01.898
You saw me?

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:04.943
I thought you were catatonic.

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:11.115
That's okay.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:13.868
I'm not embarrassed.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:18.915
I better check on the car.

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:34.013
Hey, Ferris!

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:36.724
Yeah?

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.729
The miles aren't coming off.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.817
The miles aren't coming off
going in reverse.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.826
Well, I thought that might be a problem.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.788
Just have to crack open the odometer,
roll it back by hand.

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:01.749
No. Forget it.

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:05.003
Forget it.

01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:12.844
I gotta take a stand.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:18.933
I'm bullshit.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.189
I put up with everything.

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.238
My old man pushes me around.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:37.201
I never say anything!

01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:44.584
Well, he's not the problem.
I'm the problem.

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.259
I gotta take a stand.

01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:58.931
I gotta take a stand against him.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.604
I am not gonna sit on my ass

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:08.733
as the events that affect me unfold
to determine the course of my life.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.443
I'm gonna take a stand.

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:13.863
I'm gonna defend it.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.450
Right or wrong, I'm gonna defend it.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.714
I'm so sick of his shit!

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:35.968
I can't stand him,
and I hate this goddamn car.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:39.389
Who do you love? Who do you love?
You love a car.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.016
You son of a bitch.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040
Shit.

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:10.837
I dented the shit out of it.

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:16.718
Good.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:24.642
My father will come home,
he'll see what I did. I can't hide this.

01:24:27.438 --> 01:24:31.023
He'll come home, he'll see what I did.
He'll have to deal with me.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.110
I don't care, I really don't.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.905
I'm just tired of being afraid.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:46.497
Hell with him.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:53.296
I can't wait to see the look
on the bastard's face.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.535
What'd I do?

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:39.884
- What'd I do?
- You killed the car.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:19.632
Whoa.

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:24.262
Holy shit.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:40.111
Cameron, it's my fault.

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:41.946
I'll take the heat for it.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.489
We'll wait for your father to come home

01:26:43.574 --> 01:26:45.491
and when he gets here,
I'll tell him that I did it.

01:26:45.576 --> 01:26:46.993
He hates me anyway.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.501
No. I'll take it.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.128
No, I'll take it.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:27:00.047
No. No, you don't want this much heat.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.674
I want it. If I didn't want it,

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:03.885
I wouldn't have let you
take the car out this morning.

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:06.262
I made you take the car this morning.

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:07.972
I could've stopped you.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.183
It is possible to stop
Mr. Ferris Bueller, you know?

01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:14.186
No, I want it. I'm gonna take it. That's it.

01:27:15.314 --> 01:27:17.648
When Morris comes home,

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.943
he and I'll just have a little chat.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:24.030
It's cool.

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:26.824
No, it's gonna be good.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.911
Thanks anyway.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.421
This is a shock to me.

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:43.090
I mean, first of all, I don't know
why she wasn't in school.

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:45.343
And second of all, I just can't believe

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:47.929
she came to you
with this story about an intruder.

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:52.099
Well, for whatever reason she did it,
I think she's had a pretty good scare.

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.102
Well, I really appreciate your calling me.
Really.

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:57.146
I can assure you that her father
and I are going

01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:59.273
to have a long talk
with her when we get home.

01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:00.733
Thank you so much.

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.779
Oh, by the way,
I hope your son is feeling better.

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:06.197
I beg your pardon?

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:09.200
Tell him all the guys
at the station here are pulling for him.

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:11.243
Oh, right.

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:23.214
- Hi.
- Don't "hi" me, young lady.

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.508
- I wanna get out of here, now, all right?
- Okay.

01:28:25.592 --> 01:28:27.176
No, now. Let's get out of here.

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.928
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:30.012
- Yes.
- Now.

01:28:30.097 --> 01:28:31.097
Fine.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.640
Okay.

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:41.065
- She's a little hyper.
- Yeah.

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:48.072
Let's not ruin this
with a lot of talk, all right? Okay?

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:51.492
You didn't tell me your name.

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:57.331
Well, it's Jean,
but, a lot of guys call me Shauna.

01:28:58.417 --> 01:28:59.750
Okay, Jean.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.335
Cool.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:04.088
That's great.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.799
I'll see you, okay?

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.010
Yeah.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.098
Jeanie, now!

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:18.227
- Now!
- Okay!

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:27.903
I had a great time today.

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:31.323
Yeah. It was pretty cool.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:36.245
Do you...
Do you think Cameron's gonna be okay?

01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:37.371
Oh, yeah.

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:40.624
Yeah, sure. For the first time in his life.

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.626
He's gonna be just fine.

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:54.472
You knew what you were doing when
you woke up this morning, didn't you?

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.641
Me? No.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:20.915
Oh, shit. I have to go.

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:24.919
- I'll call you tonight.
- Okay.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:31.675
- I love you!
- I love you, too!

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.346
He's gonna marry me.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:41.811
Do you know what it's like
to be pulled out of work

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:44.313
to pick up your daughter
at the police station?

01:30:44.397 --> 01:30:45.439
No, not really.

01:30:45.524 --> 01:30:47.024
Well, on top of everything else,

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:50.486
I was about to close the damn deal
with the Vermont people.

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:52.113
I'm sorry.

01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:57.368
I was gonna take my commission
and buy Ferris a car.

01:30:59.246 --> 01:31:03.249
Jeanie, what the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill us?

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:04.959
God, look at this mess.

01:31:05.043 --> 01:31:08.003
Paper all over the place.
I'll never get this back in order.

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:17.471
Jeanie!

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:30.025
- Slow down! Now! Now!
- I can't drive when you're yelling at me!

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:31.193
Stop it!

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:03.767
- Hi, how you doing? Ferris Bueller.
- Hi.

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:33.607
- No, don't get up.
- Hey.

01:33:33.692 --> 01:33:35.192
Smells delicious.

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:37.611
- Dinner's ready.
- What?

01:33:37.821 --> 01:33:39.196
Who's that?

01:34:12.355 --> 01:34:15.858
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:18.861
I just picked up Jeanie
at the police station.

01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:23.157
She got a speeding ticket,
another speeding ticket

01:34:23.241 --> 01:34:25.034
and I lost the Vermont deal
because of her.

01:34:25.118 --> 01:34:26.952
I think we should shoot her.

01:34:33.752 --> 01:34:35.419
Looking for this?

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:49.475
I got you, Ferris.

01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:52.102
- How's Ferris? Let's go check on him.
- Okay, honey. Yeah.

01:34:52.979 --> 01:34:54.355
How was your day?

01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:58.025
I have dreamed about this.

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:03.238
This time, goddamn, you little bastard,

01:35:04.199 --> 01:35:06.408
I've got you right where I want you.

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:08.327
Ferris, we're home.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.580
So,

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:17.044
how would you feel
about another year of high school?

01:35:18.505 --> 01:35:22.299
Under my close personal supervision.

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.052
Hi.

01:35:27.597 --> 01:35:31.475
Thank God you're all right. You know,
we've been worried sick about you.

01:35:36.439 --> 01:35:38.899
Thank you, Mr. Rooney,
for driving him home.

01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:43.612
Now I want you to go upstairs
and get in bed.

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:56.041
Scoot!

01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:59.420
Can you imagine
someone as sick as Ferris

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:01.797
trying to walk home from the hospital?

01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:04.758
Oh, kids.

01:36:07.887 --> 01:36:11.890
By the way, Mr. Rooney,
you left your wallet on the kitchen floor.

01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:19.082
Honey.

01:37:20.752 --> 01:37:23.754
- He's still awfully warm.
- How do you feel?

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:28.258
150% better. Thank you.

01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:31.094
Please,

01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:34.765
don't make me stay home again.
I wanna go to school.

01:37:35.517 --> 01:37:39.770
I have to graduate in June. And I want...

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:41.813
Ferris, you're sick.

01:37:42.315 --> 01:37:44.858
Now don't go pushing it
and making yourself worse.

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:48.779
- Maybe you're right, Dad.
- I know I'm right, pal.

01:37:50.657 --> 01:37:52.950
How'd you get to be so sweet?

01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:55.619
Years of practice.

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:07.130
Blanket.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:18.642
Get well.

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:21.728
Come on.

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:28.652
Listen, I'm going to get myself settled
and I'll bring a hot cup of soup, okay?

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:40.330
Yup.

01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:43.166
I said it before and I'll say it again.

01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:45.460
Life moves pretty fast.

01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:49.590
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it.

01:39:00.685 --> 01:39:03.312
Four years of chasing this kid.

01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:07.524
Four years he has been
making a fool of me.

01:39:18.036 --> 01:39:21.872
Hey, Mr. Rooney, what's going on?

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:27.044
Did you get in a fight?

01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:29.713
Want a lift?

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:19.322
I bet you never smelled
a real school bus before.

01:41:33.296 --> 01:41:34.421
Gummy Bear?

01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:39.259
They've been in my pocket.
They're real warm and soft.

01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:28.767
You're still here?

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:32.813
It's over.

01:42:34.857 --> 01:42:36.024
Go home.

01:42:40.530 --> 01:42:42.000
Go.
