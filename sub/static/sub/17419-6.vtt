Oh. Hi. Uh, Mom,

Uh, this is my girlfriend Kayla.

00:27.536 --> 00:29.271
So, "girlfriend," huh?

00:29.272 --> 00:31.343
Well, uh, sorry?

00:31.344 --> 00:33.348
Well, I just, I noticed back there

00:33.349 --> 00:35.516
you introduced me as your <i> girlfriend.</i>

00:35.517 --> 00:36.551

00:36.552 --> 00:38.453
Yeah, so I did.

00:38.454 --> 00:40.857
Uh... is that okay?

00:40.858 --> 00:42.595
- Yeah. I like it.
- Really?

00:42.596 --> 00:43.796
I like it, too.

00:43.797 --> 00:45.062
I-I just, I...

00:45.063 --> 00:46.997
I don't know, I feel like...

00:46.998 --> 00:49.435
there's kind of something here, and...

00:49.436 --> 00:51.172
maybe we should, like,

00:51.173 --> 00:52.639
- go for it.
- Well, are you sure

00:52.640 --> 00:54.142
you're not gonna miss...

00:54.143 --> 00:56.079
(deep voice): the single life? (laughs)

00:56.080 --> 00:57.749
No. No, no. No, not at all. No.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.254
(laughs) Um...

00:59.255 --> 01:01.288

Yeah, yeah. From-from this day forward,

01:04.759 --> 01:06.161
we are officially, uh,

01:06.162 --> 01:07.798

Okay, coming in, coming in hot.

Uh... oh, my God,

01:27.555 --> 01:29.457
she's having a stroke. Hey, Kayla?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.861

01:34.862 --> 01:36.063
Ew.

02:57.419 --> 02:58.953
- come have sex with us.
- No. No.

02:58.954 --> 03:00.387
Condom-less sex.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.955
- Oh, my God. No...
- Please?

I'm sorry, okay?
I care... I care about this.

03:07.762 --> 03:08.630
Okay? We can't help it.

03:08.631 --> 03:11.833
We find you irresistible.

You... I can't believe you guys
think I'm handsome.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.301
We don't. We are blind.

03:16.302 --> 03:17.403
Ah. Our noses, though,

03:17.404 --> 03:19.573
are extremely well developed.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.406
We've evolved to smell confidence.

03:21.407 --> 03:22.805
And there's no one more confident

03:22.806 --> 03:25.940
than a man in a committed relationship.

Please have sex with us.

03:30.746 --> 03:32.045

03:32.046 --> 03:34.748
Quick is actually what we prefer.

Let's smoke this space joint.

Watch a movie. And just kind of hang out.

Okay? Okay, fine,

So, okay, these girls are all up
in your nuts... and then what?

Well, then I look them
in the eyes and I said...

like hanging out with.

05:13.627 --> 05:15.261
- Oh, I-I got to go.
- What? I thought

05:15.262 --> 05:17.096
we were gonna get high and look at bugs.

05:17.097 --> 05:19.964
No, I kind of have a bit of a
plan to surprise Kayla at work.

05:19.965 --> 05:21.600
You bought her chocolates.

05:21.601 --> 05:23.636
- Salt-encrusted.
- Josh, if you're not careful,

05:23.637 --> 05:25.940
you're gonna end up married to this girl.

05:25.941 --> 05:27.510
- We-we just started going out.
- Does she keep

05:27.511 --> 05:28.878
any stuff at your apartment?

05:28.879 --> 05:31.214
Uh, no. Uh... Don't you lie to me.

05:31.215 --> 05:32.982
- Don't lie to me!
- Okay, work-work clothes

05:32.983 --> 05:35.452

I'm 39 years old,
and I'm serving a life sentence

You know, when I met Amy, she was fun!

08:08.865 --> 08:12.099
She... chugged beer faster than me.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.704
(wry chuckle): She loved cocaine.

08:14.705 --> 08:17.238
Do it whenever it was around.

08:17.239 --> 08:18.872
A month ago,

08:18.873 --> 08:20.672
she caught me smoking
a cigarette right there

08:20.673 --> 08:23.344
on the porch, and she started to cry.

08:23.345 --> 08:25.380
She made me promise

08:25.381 --> 08:28.383
to start taking my health more seriously.

08:28.384 --> 08:32.289
Yeah. So I started doing Pilates.

08:32.924 --> 08:36.094
I do this thing, and then I do this thing!

08:36.095 --> 08:39.794

- Yeah.

09:06.682 --> 09:08.352
Let's see what it says.

09:08.353 --> 09:09.554
"Five...

09:09.555 --> 09:11.191
"five little kisses

09:11.192 --> 09:13.626
- for your cute little baby face."
- Five kisses?

09:13.627 --> 09:17.366
Oh, 'cause we got eight...
eight guys here. I don't know

09:17.367 --> 09:19.433
if that's enough kisses for everyone.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.502
Who's gonna suck <i> my</i> dick?

09:21.503 --> 09:24.205
- U-Understood.
- MIKE: He's the one I was telling you about.

09:24.206 --> 09:27.004
He's only 27, and already
in a serious relationship.

09:27.005 --> 09:29.239
No, we just kind of
started seeing each other, so...

09:29.240 --> 09:30.841
Oh, first you're just going out,

09:30.842 --> 09:32.909
then all of a sudden she's got almond milk

09:32.910 --> 09:34.475
and work clothes at your place.

09:34.476 --> 09:36.777
Next thing you know, (shouts): ding-dong,

09:36.778 --> 09:38.945
ding-dong, you're married, you're pregnant,

09:38.946 --> 09:40.813
gravestone.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.181
(dramatic music plays)

09:43.182 --> 09:44.750
Listen, I mean, you're a great girl.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.452
I just, I don't think it's working out.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.652
It's not you... I mean,
everything's so crazy

09:48.653 --> 09:50.452
- with my band right now...
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

09:50.453 --> 09:54.057
I-I mean, maybe we can try,
like, an open relationship.

09:54.058 --> 09:55.725
Uh... Becca?

09:55.726 --> 09:57.359
You there?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.095
JOSH: Uh, hi, Kayla. So, I've been doing

09:59.096 --> 10:01.665
a lot of thinking about, uh, us,

10:01.666 --> 10:05.636
and I just needed to say that...

10:05.637 --> 10:07.738
I like you a lot...

10:07.739 --> 10:10.506
and also, what do you think
about Portobello mushrooms

10:10.507 --> 10:12.340
for dinner? They do go with quinoa!

10:12.341 --> 10:14.840
Exactly what I was thinking. So eight-ish?

10:14.841 --> 10:17.478
(hoarsely): We lost him.

10:24.986 --> 10:26.989
(gasps) Quinoa.

10:28.291 --> 10:29.689
Quinoa.

10:29.690 --> 10:31.389
(thunder crashes in distance)

10:31.390 --> 10:32.691
(sizzling)

10:32.692 --> 10:34.696
(knocking on door)

10:37.733 --> 10:39.598
M... M-Maggie.

10:39.599 --> 10:41.098
Hey.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.398
I'm sorry for barging in like this.

10:43.399 --> 10:44.999
I just, um...

10:45.000 --> 10:47.502
I really need a friend right now.

10:47.503 --> 10:50.939
- Can I come in?
- Well, yeah. Of course. Yeah. C-Come on in.

10:50.940 --> 10:53.876
- Thanks. (crying)
- Whoa. Whoa.

10:53.877 --> 10:54.912
(Maggie crying)

10:54.913 --> 10:56.981
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

10:56.982 --> 10:58.949
Hi. Hi, uh, Kayla. I think... I think...

10:58.950 --> 11:01.884
I think I need to postpone.
Um, I'm feeling kind of tired,

11:01.885 --> 11:03.518
all of a sudden, like I...

11:03.519 --> 11:05.287
like I might be coming down with something.

11:05.288 --> 11:07.155
You don't have to cook, if it's a hassle.

11:07.156 --> 11:09.554
We could just do takeout. Y...

11:09.555 --> 11:12.553
W-Would it be okay if we just try tomorrow?

11:12.554 --> 11:15.658
Yeah. Get some rest,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

11:15.659 --> 11:17.827
Okay. Thank you so much.
That's-that's lovely.

11:17.828 --> 11:19.428
I'll see you... I'll see you then.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.829
(toilet flushes)

11:20.830 --> 11:22.830
and I told him,
"If you don't appreciate me,

11:22.831 --> 11:24.932
I don't think I can do this anymore."

11:24.933 --> 11:27.833
Wh-Which... I mean, I think you
did the right thing. Yeah.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.236
- Yeah?
- It's none of my business,

11:30.237 --> 11:32.974
but you don't deserve to
be treated like that.

11:32.975 --> 11:34.443
I don't.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.843
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

11:36.844 --> 11:39.278
for unloading on you like this. I just...

11:39.279 --> 11:41.746
You know, nobody knows me
like you do, so...

11:41.747 --> 11:43.682
(thunder rumbling)

11:43.683 --> 11:46.652
(sizzling) Are you cooking something?

11:46.653 --> 11:49.052
- Oh, crap. Yes, I am, too.
- Really?

11:49.053 --> 11:52.220
That would be... You're
smelling portobello mushrooms,

11:52.221 --> 11:54.290
uh, and quinoa.

11:54.291 --> 11:57.224
Really! Well, I'm full of surprises.
Would you...

11:57.225 --> 11:58.558
would you like some?

11:58.559 --> 11:59.960
Um... can I?

11:59.961 --> 12:02.163
- Yeah. Yeah. Is...
- Yeah?

12:02.164 --> 12:05.499
No, there's enough, uh...
there's enough for two people.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.301
(chuckling): Yes.

12:07.302 --> 12:09.735
(gavel banging) Okay, just...

12:09.736 --> 12:12.203
- uh, will you just give me a few moments?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:12.204 --> 12:14.270
I need to...

12:14.271 --> 12:16.340
(sighs)

12:16.341 --> 12:19.839
(thunder rumbling)

12:19.840 --> 12:21.907
They're ready for you inside,
Mr. Greenberg.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.009
Okay.

12:24.010 --> 12:27.141
Mr. Greenberg, you stand accused
of boyfriend misconduct.

12:27.142 --> 12:29.843
- How do you plead?
- Not-not guilty,

12:29.844 --> 12:30.743
Your Honor. (gasping)

12:30.744 --> 12:32.908
The fact is, all right,

12:32.909 --> 12:34.274
I postponed dinner with Kayla.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.840
But, uh, where's the crime in that?

12:35.841 --> 12:38.509
Does a boyfriend not have the right to...

12:38.510 --> 12:41.280
- rearrange a date?
- Son, that's not

12:41.281 --> 12:43.347
what's at issue here. You are here today

12:43.348 --> 12:45.685
because you lied to her.

12:45.686 --> 12:46.955
Up, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup!

12:46.956 --> 12:49.224
<i>Webster's Dictionary,</i>

12:49.225 --> 12:51.192
which I'm sure you're familiar with...

12:51.193 --> 12:53.896
I'm sure all these good
people, familiar with it...

12:53.897 --> 12:57.868
defines a lie thusly,
as a falsehood, an untruth.

12:57.869 --> 13:00.403
All I did was kind of alter plans.

13:00.404 --> 13:04.774
- No lies were uttered.
- Thank you for the vocabulary lesson, Mr. Greenberg.

13:04.775 --> 13:06.675
What about when you said... and I quote...

13:06.676 --> 13:08.677
"I am feeling kind of tired."

13:09.846 --> 13:12.013
- I was feeling kind of tired.
- Maybe.

13:12.014 --> 13:13.380
But that's not why you canceled dinner.

13:13.381 --> 13:15.514
You canceled because
your ex-girlfriend showed up...

13:15.515 --> 13:16.647
Well, now, listen, Your Honor,

13:16.648 --> 13:18.382
we-we can split hairs all day,

13:18.383 --> 13:20.115
jibber-jabber back and forth

13:20.116 --> 13:22.719
until we're as mixed up as a...

13:22.720 --> 13:24.286
as a one-legged man at a hoedown!

13:24.287 --> 13:25.718
(laughter)

13:25.719 --> 13:27.483
- Why is that funny?
- But the fact is

13:27.484 --> 13:29.048
I have committed no offense,

13:29.049 --> 13:32.046
and I defy this court to prove otherwise.

13:33.922 --> 13:36.857
Aw, screw it. All right,
the court finds in Josh's favor.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.392
I knew it! Thank you...

13:39.393 --> 13:41.060
Do not give him high fives. Do not!

13:42.596 --> 13:45.465
Indicate high fives. Multiple.

13:45.466 --> 13:47.167
And then that guy was all like, Mm-hmm.

13:47.168 --> 13:49.234
"Uh, reservation? What reservation?"

13:49.235 --> 13:52.269
(laughs) So creepy. Yeah... yeah. So scary.

13:52.270 --> 13:54.607
- Remember how gross that pool was?
- Oh, my God.

13:54.608 --> 13:57.008
Somehow didn't dissuade
the-the two of us dumb-asses

13:57.009 --> 13:59.209
- from swimming in it.
- (laughs)

13:59.210 --> 14:00.746
Not just swimming in it.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.154
(gavel banging) I'll... be right back.

14:07.155 --> 14:09.326
I mean, how many times are we
gonna do this? Your Honor...

14:09.327 --> 14:12.398
- I am completely innocent.
- Oh, please. She referenced sex

14:12.399 --> 14:14.367
- and then she touched you on the hand.
- Oh.

14:14.368 --> 14:16.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't... (stammers)

14:16.001 --> 14:17.568
Are friends not allowed
to touch each other's hands?

14:17.569 --> 14:19.137
I didn't realize that.

14:19.138 --> 14:21.673
Of course they are. Wh-What's next?

14:21.674 --> 14:24.472
No more high fives? A ban on
fist bumps, perhaps, eh?

14:24.473 --> 14:27.076
(laughter) All right. What about the wine?

14:27.077 --> 14:28.245
- Explain that.
- Aha!

14:28.246 --> 14:30.547
<i>Webster's Dictionary</i>

14:30.548 --> 14:34.714
defines wine as "the fermented
juice of grapes used especially

14:34.715 --> 14:37.820
- as a bev..." I'm sorry. 
- I didn't mean explain wine.

14:37.821 --> 14:40.423
We know what wine is. (groans)

14:40.424 --> 14:42.125
There's a precedent
for grown-ups sharing a bottle

14:42.126 --> 14:43.561
- of wine at dinner.
- Oh, really?

14:43.562 --> 14:44.962
- Mm-hmm.
- But when's the last time

14:44.963 --> 14:46.729
that you and Mike shared a bottle of wine?

14:46.730 --> 14:50.201
Shared a bottle of wine
and touched each other's hands?

14:50.202 --> 14:52.803
Listen, we-we can... we
can jibber-jabber all day,

14:52.804 --> 14:54.537
back and forth Jibber-jabber a second time.

14:54.538 --> 14:56.841
Until we're as... mixed up as a-a...

14:56.842 --> 14:58.810
three-legged horse at a rodeo.

14:58.811 --> 15:01.646
(woman chuckles, man coughs)

15:01.647 --> 15:02.647
One lady.

15:02.648 --> 15:04.115
Thank you, ma'am.

15:04.116 --> 15:06.720
Uh, but the-the fact remains,

15:06.721 --> 15:09.024
I have done nothing wrong.

15:09.025 --> 15:10.960
(sighs) Goddamn it.

15:10.961 --> 15:13.296
All right, my hands are tied.

15:13.297 --> 15:14.898
Due to a lack of hard evidence,

15:14.899 --> 15:17.368
this court is forced to rule
in Josh's favor.

15:17.369 --> 15:19.703
No one high-five him.

15:19.704 --> 15:21.504
- Thank you. She did.
- JUDGE: Oh...

15:21.505 --> 15:22.438
(annoyed): Susan...

15:22.439 --> 15:24.477
(yawning)

15:24.478 --> 15:26.146
- Hey.
- Oh.

15:26.147 --> 15:28.182
I am so tired.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.084
Yeah.

15:30.085 --> 15:32.516
Oh. Yeah, I guess... I guess it's late.

15:32.517 --> 15:34.017
It is late.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.754
I should probably go.

15:39.290 --> 15:41.526
Or-or-or...

15:41.527 --> 15:44.695
or... we-we, uh...

15:44.696 --> 15:47.198
could watch something.

15:47.199 --> 15:48.665
Like what?

15:48.666 --> 15:51.268
We never finished <i> Carnivàle.</i>

15:51.269 --> 15:52.068
(gavel banging)

15:52.069 --> 15:53.904
I know, I know.

15:53.905 --> 15:56.241
People watch shows together
all the time, man.

15:56.242 --> 15:58.976
But come on, man... I mean,
she was about to leave.

15:58.977 --> 16:01.243
She was out the door, and you suggested
something that would keep her there.

16:01.244 --> 16:03.246
That's, for me, when it became a date.

16:03.247 --> 16:05.549
A-a date? Specifically a date?

16:05.550 --> 16:06.817
- Yes.
- Because...

16:06.818 --> 16:08.084
the dictionary might disagree.

16:08.085 --> 16:09.017
(Groaning) Oh, God, the dictionary...!

16:09.018 --> 16:11.252
Oh, fuck you off.

16:11.253 --> 16:14.927
<i>Webster's</i> defines a date
as a romantic outing, okay?

16:14.928 --> 16:17.796
- So did we go... did we go out?
- No. No. No.

16:17.797 --> 16:20.032
Did we kiss? Maybe not. But,
come on, you're on the couch,

16:20.033 --> 16:22.202
- you're watching <i> Carnivàle.</i>
- Listen,

16:22.203 --> 16:24.373
- I am not the kind of guy who cheats.
- Well...

16:24.374 --> 16:27.177
The point is we can
jibber-jabber back and forth...

16:27.178 --> 16:28.677
Okay? Until we're
Jibber-jabber a third time.

16:28.678 --> 16:30.647
As mixed up as a-a...

16:30.648 --> 16:32.652
Here it comes... two-horned!

16:32.653 --> 16:35.223
- As a two-horned, uh...
- Asian.

16:35.224 --> 16:37.457
- Asian, um...
- Careful.

16:37.458 --> 16:39.625
- You son of a bitch. Okay.
- Trapped.

16:39.626 --> 16:41.162
All right. I used to be a prosecutor.

16:41.163 --> 16:43.466
The point is what I'm trying to say is

16:43.467 --> 16:47.068
technically...
I haven't done anything wrong.

16:47.069 --> 16:49.304
- Well, technically, no, you haven't.
- Aha!

16:49.305 --> 16:50.740
Technically, no, I haven't.

16:50.741 --> 16:52.041
You said technically I
haven't done anything wrong.

16:52.042 --> 16:54.443
That means... that means I win.

16:56.678 --> 16:59.845
Remember this day.

16:59.846 --> 17:02.778
The day that blind Lady Justice

17:02.779 --> 17:04.547
took her own life.

17:06.016 --> 17:07.717
It is with great shame

17:07.718 --> 17:10.484
and utter disgust...

17:10.486 --> 17:13.623
that this court is forced
to rule in Josh's favor.

17:13.624 --> 17:15.558
Thanks, man.

17:15.559 --> 17:17.060
"Thanks, man"?

17:17.060 --> 17:19.060
Don't type that. What are...

17:19.061 --> 17:21.394
Goddamn it.

17:21.395 --> 17:23.866
MAN: The moment you put on that
red nose and threw in your lot

17:23.867 --> 17:25.635
with the strongman and the dog boy...

17:25.636 --> 17:28.939
Yeah. It's a pretty good...
pretty good episode

17:28.940 --> 17:30.807
of <i> Carnivàle.</i>

17:30.808 --> 17:33.009
MAN: You cannot stop the cyclone's swirl

17:33.010 --> 17:36.046
or the dog boy's dog boy dance.

17:36.047 --> 17:39.113
- The great orb spins despite.
- Um...

17:39.114 --> 17:43.287
the will of man, and now the
dust has settled on the choices

17:43.288 --> 17:44.886
thou hath wrought.

17:44.887 --> 17:47.823
For this is no carnival, my friend.

17:47.824 --> 17:49.794
This is Carnivàle! (gavel banging)

17:50.797 --> 17:51.762
(gavel continues banging)

17:55.933 --> 17:58.402
We're ready.

17:58.403 --> 17:59.937
Josh?

18:01.472 --> 18:02.772
Think he went to the bedroom with her?

18:02.773 --> 18:04.775

company and I'm really sorry

18:30.061 --> 18:32.294
about this, but I don't think
we can keep hanging out.

18:32.295 --> 18:36.634
So we should probably not have dinner.

18:38.036 --> 18:40.336
- This is abrupt.
- Yeah. Yep.

18:40.337 --> 18:43.444
I know. I'm sorry.

We-we finished <i>Carnivàle</i> last night.

19:34.863 --> 19:36.830
Hmm?

(sighs)

20:02.627 --> 20:04.863
