00:01.570 --> 00:02.780
Previously on Legacies...

00:02.780 --> 00:03.780
Hope, you can't
leave me here.

00:03.780 --> 00:05.910
I can't leave with you.

00:05.910 --> 00:06.830
Who are you?

00:06.830 --> 00:07.870
HOPE:
The entire world

00:07.870 --> 00:09.290
has forgotten that I exist,

00:09.290 --> 00:11.370
and the boy I love
has moved on.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.580
Send me back,

00:12.580 --> 00:14.420
and I will be the bad guy.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.300
Call me Headmaster.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.710
CLARKE:
I'll make you proud.

00:17.710 --> 00:21.220
I will destroy Hope Mikaelson.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.260
The monsters are back.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.260
I have no idea how or why

00:24.260 --> 00:25.260
or if it's gonna stop.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.680
I did black magic.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.640
You said you had something
that could help.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.020
I think it's working.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.150
Yes, it is.

00:32.150 --> 00:33.310
I found a way
to bring back everyone's

00:33.310 --> 00:34.940
Malivore memories.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.360
JOSIE:
You do remember her.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.490
That changes things, right?

00:42.490 --> 00:44.240
I don't know yet.

LANDON:
Have you ever had a memory
where you can't tell

01:06.970 --> 01:09.640

or if it was just a dream?

01:09.640 --> 01:11.480

01:11.480 --> 01:13.480

So, this is...

02:22.710 --> 02:24.590
nice, right?
(chuckles)

02:24.590 --> 02:25.510
Together again.

02:25.510 --> 02:27.260
It's great.
It's awesome.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.850
I mean, for the two of you
not to be talking to each other

02:29.850 --> 02:31.510
just because you're competing
for the love

02:31.510 --> 02:33.060
of the same garden gnome...

02:33.060 --> 02:36.600
I think we're more evolved
than that as women.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.360
Absolutely.
Without a doubt.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.360
Good. Because, personally,

02:41.360 --> 02:42.650
I've never been better.

02:42.650 --> 02:43.650
My work paid off.

02:43.650 --> 02:44.900
My mind is sharp.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.450
All perceived mental
breakdowns were

02:46.450 --> 02:47.910
a figment of my imagination

02:47.910 --> 02:50.620
fed by two manipulative vampires

02:50.620 --> 02:53.700
who will remain
forever my enemies.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.910
What's going on
with Sebastian?

02:55.910 --> 02:58.540
Headmaster Downton Abbey
wants us to enroll him

02:58.540 --> 03:00.380
to keep him off the streets.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.960
But after deliberately letting
me think that I was unwell,

03:03.960 --> 03:06.380
I will not let that happen.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.220
You should forgive MG.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.090
Never.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.850
He didn't want
to hurt you.

03:12.850 --> 03:15.100
He hid things from me.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.680
Zero stars.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.560
He's not the only friend
keeping secrets.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.810
I didn't want to
hurt you either.

03:20.810 --> 03:23.440
Yeah, well, zero stars.

03:27.190 --> 03:29.320
Is that what I think it is?

03:29.320 --> 03:30.870
Yeah.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.580
Here.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.660
I don't need
it anymore.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.750
Thanks.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.500
Look at us.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.590
Clear hearts and minds.

03:45.590 --> 03:48.340
Letting the power
of our intellect rule the day

03:48.340 --> 03:49.510
over our emotions.

03:49.510 --> 03:53.010
Moving forward
with dignity and grace.

03:53.010 --> 03:57.180
This is the true definition
of girl power.

03:57.180 --> 03:59.690
I'm proud of us.

03:59.690 --> 04:03.360
MAN:
Greetings, witches.

04:09.570 --> 04:11.320
Who the hell are you?

04:11.320 --> 04:14.450
An answer for an answer.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.450
There are two sisters.

04:16.450 --> 04:18.250
One gives birth
to the other.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.870
And the other,
in turn,

04:19.870 --> 04:23.130
gives birth to the first.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.790
Who are they?

04:25.590 --> 04:27.210
They're...?

04:27.210 --> 04:28.960
JOSIE: Night
and day.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.550
The sisters are Night and Day.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.220
Ah.

04:33.220 --> 04:36.100
Your reward for answering
correctly is to know that you

04:36.100 --> 04:40.480
are in the presence of
the master of the ancient lands.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.230
The all-holy,

04:42.230 --> 04:44.900
ever-divine sphinx.

04:49.570 --> 04:50.950
(sighs)

04:50.950 --> 04:54.700
People are
usually more impressed.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.450
It's been a
long semester.

04:56.450 --> 04:57.910
Prohibere.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.500
ALL:
Invisique.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.250
LIZZIE:
See? Girl power.

05:10.590 --> 05:12.760
(school bell rings)

05:12.760 --> 05:15.180
ALARIC:
Headmaster Vardemus, please.

05:15.180 --> 05:17.350
I'll hold.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.760
(knocking)

05:18.760 --> 05:20.810
Hey. So, good news.

05:20.810 --> 05:22.810
We caught another monster.
It's a sphinx,

05:22.810 --> 05:25.810
in case you had that
on your Malivore bracket.

05:25.810 --> 05:27.190
Which must mean
that the zombie's

05:27.190 --> 05:29.980
probably roadkill
by now, right?

05:29.980 --> 05:31.570
Unless Malivore is
actually starting to send

05:31.570 --> 05:32.780
two monsters at a time,

05:32.780 --> 05:34.530
in which-- 'Kay.

05:34.530 --> 05:37.870
Uh, good morning to you, too.
(chuckles softly, sighs)

05:37.870 --> 05:40.370
You told me your story.

05:40.370 --> 05:42.710
(sighs)
But now,

05:42.710 --> 05:44.790
with the memories,

05:44.790 --> 05:47.540
I'm just happy to have you back.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.300
I wish everyone else
felt the same.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.300
You're just gonna have
to give them time.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.640
Actually...

05:57.640 --> 05:59.260
planning on doing just that.

05:59.260 --> 06:01.770
I'm headed home to New
Orleans to do research

06:01.770 --> 06:03.730
on how to close the portal

06:03.730 --> 06:06.190
with my aunt
and her circle of witches.

06:06.190 --> 06:07.060
I see.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.020
Now, this trip to New Orleans,

06:10.020 --> 06:13.190
is it round-trip or...

06:13.190 --> 06:14.860
one-way?

06:14.860 --> 06:17.740
To be honest with you,
I don't know.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.740
LANDON:
I'm sorry I don't have

06:19.740 --> 06:20.910
a straight answer for you.

06:20.910 --> 06:22.700
I obviously care
about you,

06:22.700 --> 06:24.290
and I care about Hope, too.

06:24.290 --> 06:26.830
Look, I have hit
girl power rock bottom.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.710
I hate myself for
having to ask you this,

06:28.710 --> 06:30.800
but cut to the chase.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.880
(sighs)
Who are you gonna choose?

06:32.880 --> 06:35.550
I still don't know,
because I'm not him.

06:35.550 --> 06:38.760
I'm a prismatic hologram
from your subconscious.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.890
I only know what you know.

06:41.890 --> 06:43.180
You have
to find out

06:43.180 --> 06:44.980
what he knows.
Yeah, but
he's holed up

06:44.980 --> 06:47.060
in the library,
doing research

06:47.060 --> 06:49.860
and avoiding everything.
Then you know where to find him.

06:49.860 --> 06:52.400
What do I say, though?
Look.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.860
Look at me.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.690
You still want him,
right?

06:55.690 --> 06:57.450
Of course I do.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.820
Everybody wants him, though.
That's the problem.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.570
Malivore even wants him.

07:00.570 --> 07:03.200
It's too bad I can't
just give them you.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.540
But what if you could?

07:08.670 --> 07:11.090
(indistinct chatter)

07:12.210 --> 07:14.960
You know, you don't
have to sit with me.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.510
I'm sure you have better
things you could be doing.

07:17.510 --> 07:20.010
If you're here, I'm here.

07:20.010 --> 07:21.800
That's cool, but I'm pretty sure
you haven't left my side

07:21.800 --> 07:23.560
for 22 straight hours.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.230
And if a monster
were to slip past the girls,

07:27.230 --> 07:28.850
who would have been right here
to protect you?

07:28.850 --> 07:30.860
Yeah, but
you're my brother.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.400
You're not my bodyguard.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.480
I'm whatever I need to be
to keep you safe, Lan.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.700
I owe it to you.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.660
Because of Hope?

07:39.660 --> 07:40.910
Raf, you don't owe me

07:40.910 --> 07:42.490
anything.
Just let me

07:42.490 --> 07:43.660
owe you this.

07:43.660 --> 07:44.870
(footsteps approaching)

07:44.870 --> 07:47.330
Hi.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.960
Any chance
we can talk?

07:51.960 --> 07:52.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.590
I'll give you guys some space.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.760
Hey.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.010
I have a crazy idea.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.020
As crazy ideas go,

08:09.020 --> 08:11.520
this one certainly takes
the cake.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.810
But it could work,

08:13.810 --> 08:15.150
right?

08:15.150 --> 08:17.900
I suppose it could.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.610
However, it would
require a certain level

08:20.610 --> 08:22.820
of black magic, and
I know how your father

08:22.820 --> 08:25.530
feels about you practicing
such sorcery.

08:25.530 --> 08:26.540
It's life or death.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.450
He'll deal.

08:31.870 --> 08:34.710
Technically...

08:34.710 --> 08:36.550
it is possible.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.300
Sweet.

08:43.890 --> 08:48.220
This trident will be of use.

08:51.980 --> 08:54.560
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

08:54.560 --> 08:57.230
Technically, the only person
who has to do anything dangerous

08:57.230 --> 08:58.190
is Hope.

08:58.190 --> 08:59.780
What do you think she'll say?

08:59.780 --> 09:00.990
Probably that we lost our minds

09:00.990 --> 09:02.320
and should stay out
of the hero business.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.610
And what will
you say to her

09:03.610 --> 09:05.570
in return to convince her?

09:07.530 --> 09:10.750
I guess there's only one way
to find out.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.080
(bus door hisses)

09:12.080 --> 09:14.750
(indistinct chatter)

09:15.830 --> 09:18.550
LANDON:
Hope!

09:20.630 --> 09:22.380
Don't go.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.760
I need you.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.930
Uh, I-I have to figure out a...

09:26.930 --> 09:28.470
a way to close the portal.

09:28.470 --> 09:29.890
Then I'll come
with you.

09:29.890 --> 09:32.100
I just couldn't stand
losing you again.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.560
I love you, Hope Mikaelson.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.020
Landon, I love you, too.

09:37.020 --> 09:37.900
(chuckles softly)

09:37.900 --> 09:39.480
Of course I love you.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.240
LANDON:
Aw, hell.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.780
You had to find Hope?

09:48.080 --> 09:50.080
What the hell
is happening?

10:00.420 --> 10:02.400
This is the opposite
of girl power.

10:02.530 --> 10:04.120
This is the opposite
of `.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.330
There are two Landons?

10:06.330 --> 10:07.790
We are calling the other one...

10:07.790 --> 10:09.000
SimuLandon.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I used the prism

10:10.000 --> 10:11.160
to manifest
my subconscious,

10:11.160 --> 10:12.750
and then Josie turned
him into a golem.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.840
Show her.
Oh.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.010
JOSIE:
Headmaster Vardemus helped us.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.920
We used this object
called a trident to bind

10:20.920 --> 10:23.590
the mind, body and spirit
of SimuLandon with a spell.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.720
What kind of spell?

10:24.720 --> 10:26.510
Nothing that you need
to worry about.

10:26.510 --> 10:28.930
He gave me this weird
magical hourglass

10:28.930 --> 10:30.810
that prevents
any side effects.

10:30.810 --> 10:34.270
Josie, Dad will melt you if
you're dabbling in black magic.

10:34.270 --> 10:35.520
I'm not dabbling.
I'm doing what needs

10:35.520 --> 10:36.810
to be done
to close the portal.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.480
We're gonna use him as a decoy.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.490
We'll let the sphinx
take him into the portal.

10:41.490 --> 10:43.820
I don't want to go
in the portal.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.910
I want to stay here with Hope.

10:45.910 --> 10:49.040
Uh, I think we need to talk
to your subconscious

10:49.040 --> 10:50.080
about personal space.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.330
I didn't realize
he'd be so vocal.

10:52.330 --> 10:53.830
And fast.

10:53.830 --> 10:56.000
He ran away
after we created him.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.210
I guess to find you.

10:59.380 --> 11:02.010
JOSIE:
There's one catch, though.

11:02.010 --> 11:03.680
I bound him to
the lunar cycle.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.720
So, when the moon reaches
its apex tomorrow night...

11:06.720 --> 11:08.140
Simu-me will disintegrate.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.850
What? Uh, no one
told me that part!

11:10.850 --> 11:13.600
How does that close the portal?
That's where you come in.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.980
We need to pump SimuLandon
full of Hope's blood,

11:15.980 --> 11:19.440
so when he goes in, the Tribrid
blood will close the portal.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.320
My blood's not enough
to keep the portal closed.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.650
I have to activate
my vampire side.

11:22.650 --> 11:23.900
Malivore is just gonna
spit him out

11:23.900 --> 11:25.490
and create a new portal.

11:25.490 --> 11:27.530
Not if he disintegrates before
there's anything to spit out.

11:27.530 --> 11:30.120
Portal closed, no
new portal opens.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.160
Both problems solved.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.790
Life goes back
to normal...

11:32.790 --> 11:34.080
...ish.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.120
LIZZIE:
And you thought it was smart

11:36.120 --> 11:37.960
to give Landon's
subconscious a voice?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.380
It's the only way anyone could
think of to close the portal.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.050
Or maybe you just wanted him

11:42.050 --> 11:44.170
to spill the beans
about who he wants.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.630
Pretty sure I got that question
answered already.

11:46.630 --> 11:47.970
I love you, Hope.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.390
Please stop saying that.

11:49.390 --> 11:51.470
I can't help it-- I want
to shout it from the rooftops.

11:51.470 --> 11:53.270
I love Hope--
Ad somnum.

12:02.030 --> 12:03.940
Look, I'm not letting you get

12:03.940 --> 12:05.610
anywhere near Landon, so...

12:05.610 --> 12:08.780
let's make this easy
on both of us, okay?

12:08.780 --> 12:11.120
There is a creature.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.120
At the dawn of life,
it has four feet.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.410
At the middle, two feet.

12:14.410 --> 12:17.830
And in its twilight, three feet.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.830
What is it?

12:21.210 --> 12:24.090
A baby walks on four feet,

12:24.090 --> 12:26.130
and then it stands on two feet.

12:26.130 --> 12:27.340
And then when it gets old,

12:27.340 --> 12:29.590
it walks with a cane.

12:29.590 --> 12:31.680
The answer's man.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.810
That's an easy one.

12:32.810 --> 12:34.020
Classic riddle of the sphinx.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.310
My reputation
precedes me.

12:36.310 --> 12:38.560
What else has been
written about me?

12:38.560 --> 12:40.060
(sighs)

12:40.060 --> 12:41.650
Uh, all sorts of things.

12:41.650 --> 12:43.940
The Greeks were all
about your riddles.

12:43.940 --> 12:46.940
But according
to Egyptian mythology,

12:46.940 --> 12:48.740
sphinxes were protectors.

12:48.740 --> 12:51.530
Stood guard outside
the temples of oracles.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.830
So many books.

12:54.830 --> 12:57.210
So few facts.

12:58.370 --> 13:01.880
I am not a protector of oracles.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.420
I am the oracle.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.050
And seeing as
you've answered

13:07.050 --> 13:08.970
my riddle correctly,
you've earned yourself

13:08.970 --> 13:11.260
an answer to any question.

13:11.260 --> 13:15.350
First thing they teach us
in Monster 101--

13:15.350 --> 13:17.890
don't listen to the monsters.

13:17.890 --> 13:20.850
Sphinxes can't lie.

13:20.850 --> 13:23.150
Come on.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.360
One question won't hurt.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.490
Look, the only question
I have is...

13:28.490 --> 13:32.530
how do I keep Landon
safe from Malivore?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.010
What did you just see?

13:48.010 --> 13:50.260
There's no keeping Landon safe

13:50.260 --> 13:53.220
as long as he remains here.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.220
You must get him
out of this place

13:56.220 --> 13:58.560
if you wish to keep him
from Malivore.

14:13.610 --> 14:16.120
(tape tears)

14:16.120 --> 14:18.240
Ready?

14:27.670 --> 14:30.170
So...

14:30.170 --> 14:33.010
we're not gonna
talk about how you

14:33.010 --> 14:35.390
walked away from me after
we took down the Croatoan?

14:35.390 --> 14:37.220
I didn't have much to say.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.430
Welcome back?

14:41.430 --> 14:42.390
Hm.

14:42.390 --> 14:44.980
He has plenty to say.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.060
He is my subconscious.

14:46.060 --> 14:47.820
He has no
filter.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.480
I am a complex, evolved being
last time I checked.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.200
Evolved people talk
to one other.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.200
They don't just stalk off
when things get complicated.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.040
So why don't you
stop avoiding me?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.200
I'm not avoiding you.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.540
We're literally
in the same room.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.040
Oh, you know
what I mean.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.540
Tell me how you feel.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.630
It's not about what I feel.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.340
It's about doing
the right thing.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.460
There's
a shelf life

15:10.460 --> 15:12.340
on doing the right thing.

15:12.340 --> 15:15.510
If you wait too long,
it's just wrong.

15:17.140 --> 15:21.270
So you don't have anything else
you want to say to me?

15:21.270 --> 15:23.520
I love you.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.650
So much.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.370
We got a problem.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.410
Oh.... I'll tell you who's

15:39.410 --> 15:41.120
got a problem-- Vardemus.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.160
If he thinks that he's
allowed to enroll Teen Dracula

15:43.160 --> 15:44.710
in the same school
as my daughters...

15:44.710 --> 15:45.670
Ric!

15:45.670 --> 15:47.040
The problem is Vardemus.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.170
Those forensic samples
from the crime scene at the bar

15:50.170 --> 15:51.670
that you had Sheriff
Mac forward to me?

15:51.670 --> 15:53.130
I finally got
the results back

15:53.130 --> 15:54.630
from a witch friend
of mine in Philly.

15:54.630 --> 15:57.970
They're a match
with Vardemus.

15:57.970 --> 15:59.680
Oh, you ran Vardemus' DNA.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.970
I told you I'd keep
an eye on him.

16:01.970 --> 16:04.100
But it gets weirder. Look.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.980
Wait... his results
don't make any sense.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.360
It says he's
both male and female.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.190
And every ethnicity
under the sun?

16:11.190 --> 16:12.780
But only ten percent white,

16:12.780 --> 16:14.820
which we both know
is not true.

16:14.820 --> 16:18.200
He's also part canine,
part deer.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.330
Wait, I've seen this before.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.250
At the Malivore pit,

16:25.250 --> 16:27.370
the night Hope disappeared,
there was a third person there,

16:27.370 --> 16:28.710
besides her and Landon.

16:28.710 --> 16:30.670
I couldn't figure out
who it was until...

16:32.590 --> 16:35.130
You're saying Vardemus
was at the pit?

16:35.130 --> 16:37.510
Him...

16:37.510 --> 16:42.390
or the monster
pretending to be him.

16:42.390 --> 16:44.180
So, SimuLandon
is running around

16:44.180 --> 16:46.480
telling everyone
that he loves Hope.

16:46.480 --> 16:50.020
I guess I'm second-rate.

16:50.020 --> 16:53.400
Far from second-rate,
Ms. Saltzman.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.400
You are a powerful witch now.

16:58.360 --> 17:02.160
And a long way
from gushing nosebleeds.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.370
I'm impressed with your growth.

17:04.370 --> 17:06.660
I feel like I'm gonna explode.

17:06.660 --> 17:09.710
Has that hourglass stop working?

17:09.710 --> 17:11.170
Not at all.

17:11.170 --> 17:14.300
But it holds black magic,
not strong emotions.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.960
This is more
than strong emotions.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.130
It feels like my head
is screaming at me.

17:19.130 --> 17:22.300
Well, your friend lied to you.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.010
Your twin helped her
keep that secret.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.310
Your boyfriend's heart

17:26.310 --> 17:28.230
clearly belongs to another.

17:28.230 --> 17:30.640
But fear not.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.230
There are other ways to release

17:32.230 --> 17:35.520
the demons dancing in your mind.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.900
The trident
we used this morning.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.400
(trident trilling)

17:39.400 --> 17:41.280
I believe

17:41.280 --> 17:44.910
you're finally
strong enough for this.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.340
Close your eyes.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.380
This spell

18:00.380 --> 18:02.340
will channel
the rage,

18:02.340 --> 18:05.930
the sadness, everything...

18:05.930 --> 18:07.390
into that object.

18:07.390 --> 18:10.890
It will transfer
all the dark energy

18:10.890 --> 18:12.940
right out of you.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.980
Repeat after me.

18:14.980 --> 18:17.270
Phesmatos

18:17.270 --> 18:19.440

18:37.000 --> 18:39.510

You can do this.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.800
Keep your focus.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.630
Phesmatos tribum

RAFAEL:
Hey, Landon.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.390
Hi.

21:41.390 --> 21:44.110
What are you doing, bro?

21:44.110 --> 21:48.530
It's a failsafe to protect me
against the monster.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.780
The sphinx can't take me
if I'm dead

21:50.780 --> 21:52.530
at the bottom of a lake, right?

21:52.530 --> 21:53.660
This is insane.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.280
Yeah, you mean
the SimuLandon?

21:55.280 --> 21:56.410
I mean everything.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.000
Do you even see what you're
about to do to yourself?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.540
I know that you're a phoenix
and that you'll come back,

22:04.540 --> 22:06.290
but does that make it okay?

22:06.290 --> 22:08.340
And then there's these monsters
and-and the attacks,

22:08.340 --> 22:10.670
and-and the plans
and the backup plans,

22:10.670 --> 22:12.180
but according to the sphinx,

22:12.180 --> 22:14.220
it's not even gonna
end any time soon.

22:14.220 --> 22:15.220
The sphinx is a psychic?

22:15.220 --> 22:16.850
Does that mean
he'll see this coming?

22:16.850 --> 22:18.560
Does it even matter
if he does?

22:18.560 --> 22:21.390
'Cause you guys are just gonna
cook up another crazy solution.

22:23.190 --> 22:24.690
I don't even know
how we got here.

22:24.690 --> 22:26.230
We came to this school

22:26.230 --> 22:28.650
because there was nothing out
there that was safe for us.

22:28.650 --> 22:30.110
But now it feels like

22:30.110 --> 22:32.280
this is the least safe place
on Earth.

22:34.740 --> 22:37.530
What else did
the psychic sphinx tell you?

22:45.580 --> 22:47.670
Oh, Josie. Josie.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.670
Baby.

22:49.670 --> 22:50.710
Dad.

22:51.630 --> 22:54.800
I think I did something bad.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.640
Remember, just
casually walk by him

22:57.640 --> 22:59.680
and as soon as
the sphinx sees you,

22:59.680 --> 23:01.350
I'll use magic
to open the bars

23:01.350 --> 23:02.770
and then he'll grab you

23:02.770 --> 23:04.690
and take his new toy
back to Malivore.

23:04.690 --> 23:05.940
You make this sound
easy and fun

23:05.940 --> 23:07.900
when it's actually
gruesome and terrifying.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.610
Go. Now.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.860
Landon Kirby.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.120
Patentibus.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.930
And what exactly
do I do with you?

23:41.220 --> 23:43.430
I have no need for you.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.350
Excuse me?

23:48.350 --> 23:50.310
Yes! Safe, baby.

23:51.980 --> 23:54.740
Did a hairball get lodged
in your brain?

23:54.740 --> 23:56.820
That's Landon Kirby.

23:56.820 --> 23:58.450
The one and only.

23:58.450 --> 24:01.330
Every monster that comes
out of that portal

24:01.330 --> 24:02.540
wants him for Malivore.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.660
I am not here for Landon Kirby.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.500
Why the hell are you here, then?

24:07.870 --> 24:10.750
An answer for an answer.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.420
Enough with the riddles.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.050
Fine.

24:15.050 --> 24:17.010
I'll answer your question...

24:17.010 --> 24:18.630
Great.

24:18.630 --> 24:20.390
...in the form of a riddle.

24:20.390 --> 24:22.140
Dammit.

24:22.140 --> 24:25.100
In blackness, a light emerges,

24:25.100 --> 24:28.980
illuminating the path
for darkened souls to follow.

24:28.980 --> 24:33.980
Two forge their own way,
but a third sees a new path.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.400
What is the new path?

24:42.660 --> 24:46.290
(gasps, pants)

24:46.290 --> 24:48.580
Take it easy.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.210
The school's
been evacuated,

24:50.210 --> 24:53.590
and you're in no shape to move.

24:53.590 --> 24:55.710
You'll be safe here.

24:55.710 --> 24:57.970
What's going on?

24:57.970 --> 25:00.340
(exhales) In a nutshell,
Headmaster Vardemus

25:00.340 --> 25:02.220
was a trojan horse
for Agent Clarke,

25:02.220 --> 25:03.890
and the sphinx
doesn't want Landon

25:03.890 --> 25:05.260
for reasons no
one can decipher,

25:05.260 --> 25:07.890
and Josie accidentally created

25:07.890 --> 25:10.480
a dark object
of indeterminate power.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.100
I should help.
No, hey.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.610
You have just enough blood
in your veins to breathe.

25:14.610 --> 25:17.240
Lie here and heal

25:17.240 --> 25:18.740
while I go
and patrol the school.

25:18.740 --> 25:20.360
I'll be right back.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.200
(sighs)

25:40.680 --> 25:42.550
CLARKE:
Oh, hey.

25:43.550 --> 25:45.390
Miss me?

25:51.810 --> 25:52.940
Clarke?
How did you get in here?

25:53.940 --> 25:55.690
My trusty ring.

25:55.690 --> 25:57.020
Creates illusions.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.650
I thought I'd camp out
while your friends

25:59.650 --> 26:00.820
emptied out the school.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.410
Fluctus Inpulsa.
Surprise.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.450
I found these in
the school armory.

26:06.450 --> 26:08.950
Spelled shackles that neutralize
a witch's power.

26:08.950 --> 26:11.620
Yet another of Ric's failsafes
against supernaturals.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.420
Yeah, please, go ahead,
make yourself comfortable.

26:18.420 --> 26:20.760
And while you're at it, tell me
what the hell you're doing here.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.720
I swore to my
father I would

26:22.720 --> 26:24.970
come back and take you out,

26:24.970 --> 26:27.100
but my dad

26:27.100 --> 26:29.810
screwed me over yet again.

26:29.810 --> 26:31.310
How did he do that? Hmm?

26:31.310 --> 26:35.400
He seems like such a lovely
supernatural mastermind.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.940
(chuckling)

26:36.940 --> 26:38.940
My form started
to break down.

26:38.940 --> 26:41.990
He put a ticking clock on me
in order to control me.

26:41.990 --> 26:46.910
I had to consume people
and monsters to stay stable.

26:46.910 --> 26:49.160
Well, it didn't work.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.700
I burned through
my monster food supply

26:51.700 --> 26:54.000
and I was still unstable.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.290
(ripping, squishing)

27:00.750 --> 27:04.840
Once a mud man,
always a mud man.

27:07.220 --> 27:09.050
But not anymore.

27:09.050 --> 27:13.310
I have a new solution.

27:13.310 --> 27:15.350
You.

27:17.310 --> 27:20.480
Why kill you when I can become
a powerful Tribrid

27:20.480 --> 27:23.530
and stand up to my father
once and for all?

27:23.530 --> 27:25.490
Ah, everybody
wants to be a Tribrid

27:25.490 --> 27:27.950
until they actually
have to be a Tribrid.

27:31.740 --> 27:32.950
What is that?

27:32.950 --> 27:34.450
Mm, a little weapon

27:34.450 --> 27:37.250
your frenemy Josie
helped create today.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.220
Now my consciousness

27:47.220 --> 27:50.430
will transfer into
the next person I cut.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.560
Hmm.

27:55.560 --> 28:00.610
I know I shouldn't
gloat, but...

28:00.610 --> 28:04.070
you screwed me over.

28:04.070 --> 28:06.190
And now I get payback.

28:08.070 --> 28:10.240
I'm going to enjoy this.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.910
(grunting)

28:16.080 --> 28:18.580
You literally have no blood.

28:18.580 --> 28:20.960
How far do you think
you can get?

28:24.880 --> 28:26.760
Hope?

28:33.180 --> 28:36.560
(singsongy):
Hope.

28:47.110 --> 28:49.360
(footsteps approaching)

29:16.970 --> 29:18.680
(wood creaks)

29:20.730 --> 29:22.060
For an all-powerful being,

29:22.060 --> 29:25.980
you're not great
at hide and seek.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.600
Clever girl.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.520
(sighs)

30:03.520 --> 30:05.650
(pounding)

30:06.820 --> 30:08.270
Cute little trick.

30:08.270 --> 30:10.990
Now open the door, Hope.

30:10.990 --> 30:12.280
(pounding)

30:20.250 --> 30:21.540
(grunts)

30:29.920 --> 30:31.760
Son of a...

30:42.060 --> 30:44.850
Somebody help!

30:44.850 --> 30:46.860
(panting)

30:49.070 --> 30:50.900
Somebody help!

30:50.900 --> 30:52.900
(panting)

30:56.320 --> 31:00.240
Nowhere to go,
no one to help you.
(gasping)

31:05.960 --> 31:08.540
Hello, brother.

31:09.840 --> 31:13.420
(grunting)

31:15.130 --> 31:18.090
I heard you scream.
Are you hurt?

31:18.090 --> 31:19.430
Better now that you're here.

31:19.430 --> 31:20.810
You should have jumped
into the pit

31:20.810 --> 31:22.310
instead
of your little girlfriend.

31:23.140 --> 31:25.730
Are you guys back together?

31:25.730 --> 31:29.440
The relationship drama-- it's so
hard to keep up with sometimes.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.230
So tired of hearing your voice.
Don't worry.

31:31.230 --> 31:33.070
You won't have to
hear it much longer.

31:33.070 --> 31:35.360
(grunting)

31:41.780 --> 31:44.040
I just don't get it.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.580
Oh. Get what?

31:45.580 --> 31:48.330
What our father sees
in you. Sure, you can

31:48.330 --> 31:50.540
regenerate, but
you have no magic.

31:50.540 --> 31:53.300
Someone always has to
swoop in and save you.

31:53.300 --> 31:55.590
You're pathetic.
I don't care

31:55.590 --> 31:58.180
what you or our father think
of me.

31:58.180 --> 32:00.260
I only care about her.

32:02.010 --> 32:04.970
(grunting)

32:10.150 --> 32:12.690
Sorry, Hope.
This is family business.

32:12.690 --> 32:14.610
(grunting)

32:16.110 --> 32:17.950
Okay, I'm impressed.
CLARKE:
Don't be.

32:17.950 --> 32:20.370
He'll always be
the inferior son.

32:20.370 --> 32:22.830
Well, it doesn't look
like it from this angle.

32:23.950 --> 32:25.120
Just do it.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.790
You don't need her.

32:26.790 --> 32:29.540
You need me.

32:29.540 --> 32:32.040
Do it.
(grunts)
Landon, no!

32:32.040 --> 32:33.920
This is for you, Hope.
No!

32:33.920 --> 32:36.300
(grunting)

32:38.050 --> 32:40.970
Not what I planned, but at
least phoenixes are immortal.

32:40.970 --> 32:42.680
(grunts)

32:44.390 --> 32:47.270
Now you die tomorrow.

32:47.270 --> 32:48.940
(groans)

32:50.270 --> 32:52.810
Boom. I rule.

32:54.110 --> 32:56.690
Oh, come on.

32:58.190 --> 32:59.780
(whooshing)

33:04.910 --> 33:06.910
Well...

33:06.910 --> 33:10.250
this just took a turn.

33:10.250 --> 33:13.130
(groans)

33:15.090 --> 33:16.840
(yells)

33:19.340 --> 33:23.590
You're gonna whammy me,
aren't you?
I am.

33:23.590 --> 33:26.180
Remember that I'm already
dealing with the trauma

33:26.180 --> 33:27.640
of knowing I'm dying.

33:27.640 --> 33:30.270
I will.
Kind of makes
the whole sacrifice

33:30.270 --> 33:31.690
a little less romantic,
though, no?

33:31.690 --> 33:34.690
I mean, where is the real deal?

33:34.690 --> 33:37.360
He must be off
with his other girlfr...

33:49.740 --> 33:52.040
LANDON:
I learned today that,
no matter how hard we try,

33:52.040 --> 33:55.420
we can't solve
the monster problem.

33:55.420 --> 33:57.170
I'm sorry to do this.

33:57.170 --> 33:58.710
I really wanted
to avoid this pain,

33:58.710 --> 34:01.880
but it's been long enough.

34:03.630 --> 34:05.760
Can I get you
anything?

34:05.760 --> 34:08.390
Aspirin? Ice?
A sparkling soda?

34:08.390 --> 34:09.970
No, but you can sit down.

34:12.430 --> 34:15.600
I'm sorry I didn't have
your back with mud boy.

34:15.600 --> 34:19.070
And I'm really glad
that you're okay.

34:19.070 --> 34:20.860
(knocking)

34:20.860 --> 34:25.490
Uh, hi.
Can I talk to Josie for a sec?

34:30.080 --> 34:32.240
I'll go and get some ice.

34:35.250 --> 34:38.130
LANDON:
And sometimes pain
is unavoidable.

34:38.130 --> 34:40.170
How are you feeling?

34:40.170 --> 34:42.130
Used.

34:44.300 --> 34:46.430
But I'm glad you're okay.

34:49.180 --> 34:51.010
Are you okay?

34:51.010 --> 34:55.230
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm just a little drained.

34:55.230 --> 34:56.310
Yeah, I know the feeling.

34:56.310 --> 34:58.230
(laughs softly)
Yeah.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.310
You should get some rest.

34:59.310 --> 35:01.480
Oh, yeah, I will.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.480
But, um...

35:06.950 --> 35:09.410
I wanted to know
if it was okay with you

35:09.410 --> 35:10.830
if I came back to school.

35:13.370 --> 35:15.500
I miss it.
(laughs softly)

35:15.500 --> 35:18.540
I miss my classes.

35:18.540 --> 35:20.790
Miss morning meetings.

35:22.130 --> 35:24.460
Super Squad.
(laughs)

35:26.920 --> 35:29.800
I even miss
Lizzie being mean to me.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.890
(laughs)

35:36.020 --> 35:38.190
I miss you.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.650
But, um,

35:41.650 --> 35:45.360
I won't come back
if my being here...

35:45.360 --> 35:47.360
brings you any more pain.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.990
(pen writing on paper)

35:49.990 --> 35:52.200
What's that?

35:54.240 --> 35:56.500
Penelope's
burn book.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.540
Somebody must be
using her pen.

35:59.540 --> 36:03.460
♪ If you would have just... ♪

36:03.460 --> 36:05.090
LANDON:
I've come to the realization

36:05.090 --> 36:07.760
that monsters aren't
the only problem.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.720
I'm the problem, too.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.340
I am at the center
of all this heartache.

36:12.340 --> 36:13.800
What is it?

36:13.800 --> 36:16.390
♪ They tell me to forget ♪
Um, it's Landon.

36:16.390 --> 36:18.180
♪ And I don't want to... ♪

36:18.180 --> 36:20.480
LANDON:
So I have
to leave Mystic Falls,

36:20.480 --> 36:23.230
knowing
that they'll follow me.

36:23.230 --> 36:26.230
I have to let you live
your lives without monsters

36:26.230 --> 36:28.530
and without me.

36:28.530 --> 36:31.280
I hope you can forgive me
for this someday,

36:31.280 --> 36:33.320
but I understand if you don't.

36:33.320 --> 36:37.080
With love and regret, Landon.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.590
(magical whoosh)

36:44.590 --> 36:47.130
You sure about
coming with me?

36:49.300 --> 36:50.720
All in, brother.

36:50.720 --> 36:55.550
♪ "Girl, you are better off
anyway" ♪

36:55.550 --> 36:58.720

that's not true ♪

36:58.720 --> 37:02.560
♪ I want you ♪

37:02.560 --> 37:06.400
♪ Wanted you to be the one ♪

37:06.400 --> 37:08.530
♪ Who stayed ♪

37:08.530 --> 37:11.650
♪ How can I black out you? ♪

37:11.650 --> 37:14.110
He made his choice.

37:14.110 --> 37:16.080
We can make our own.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.540
♪ You... ♪

37:18.540 --> 37:21.410
Landon or no Landon,
you belong here.

37:21.410 --> 37:23.460
I want you to stay.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.670
♪ Pin and needles in my lips ♪

37:27.670 --> 37:30.510
♪ No anesthetic... ♪

37:30.510 --> 37:32.590
I'm really sorry.

37:32.590 --> 37:35.430
Yeah. Me, too.

37:36.550 --> 37:42.640
♪ How can I black out you? ♪

37:43.640 --> 37:45.060
Something told me

37:45.060 --> 37:47.480
I needed to
upgrade from ice

37:47.480 --> 37:49.110
to ice cream.

37:49.110 --> 37:50.480
♪ You ♪

37:50.480 --> 37:53.110
♪ How can I black out you? ♪

37:53.110 --> 37:57.200
I can tell we are all feeling
a lot of emotions

37:57.200 --> 37:58.620
right now.

37:58.620 --> 38:00.120
♪ You... ♪

38:00.120 --> 38:01.870
So get this.

38:01.870 --> 38:03.500
Dad says that I'm not allowed

38:03.500 --> 38:07.500
to give Sebastian the boot
until he has checked him out.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.670
And now that there's
no headmaster,

38:08.670 --> 38:10.710
no one is going
to punish

38:10.710 --> 38:12.880
MG for his weaselly little ways.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.510
How ridiculous is that?

38:14.510 --> 38:16.140
♪ It's always been you. ♪

38:16.140 --> 38:18.640
Lizzie told me
the sphinx's riddle.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.560
It's a tough one.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.810
Yeah. I wonder what he meant
by "darkened souls."

38:22.810 --> 38:24.560
Did he mean spirits?

38:24.560 --> 38:26.770
It's possible.
Hey, by the way,

38:26.770 --> 38:29.320
uh, I just wanted to say,

38:29.320 --> 38:31.530
I should've never voted you out.

38:31.530 --> 38:33.360
I'm sorry.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.410
Well, I... I should have
never put you in that position,

38:36.410 --> 38:38.200
so we can both share the blame.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.580
(chuckles)

38:41.450 --> 38:43.660
Hey, what if the sphinx
isn't talking

38:43.660 --> 38:46.080
about spirits,
but about monsters?

38:46.080 --> 38:48.960
Every one of them that came out
of Malivore had the same agenda.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.920
They all follow the same path.
Right.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.300
But I still don't get
which two forged their own way.

38:57.510 --> 39:00.260
DORIAN:
In blackness, a light emerges.

39:00.260 --> 39:02.640
ALARIC:
The portal in Mystic Falls.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.390
Illuminating the path for
darkened souls to follow.

39:05.390 --> 39:08.350
The creatures that
emerged from the portal.

39:08.350 --> 39:10.480
Two forge their own way.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.400
Hope and Clarke.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.280
But a third...
sees a new path.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.740
You.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.620
You don't
serve Malivore

39:19.620 --> 39:21.780
because you see a new path.

39:21.780 --> 39:24.410
You serve a new master.

39:24.410 --> 39:26.000
Hmm.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.500
Well done.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.960
You solved my riddle.

39:33.590 --> 39:35.760
Malivore is terrible,

39:35.760 --> 39:37.800
but what's coming...

39:39.090 --> 39:41.680
...is even worse.
ALARIC:
Well,

39:41.680 --> 39:43.560
you're the oracle, so

39:43.560 --> 39:45.720
tell us.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.640
What's coming next?

39:58.780 --> 40:00.570
There are two prisoners.

40:00.570 --> 40:02.660
One is the master of his cage.

40:02.660 --> 40:05.330
The other returns home
without power.

40:05.330 --> 40:10.540
The sins of the father are
visited upon the daughters here.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.540
And not here.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.710
New hero rises

40:14.710 --> 40:17.760
but can be felled
by the golden arrow.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.380
The wolf among you
has many faces.

40:20.380 --> 40:23.300
When time fractures,

40:23.300 --> 40:25.260
darkness overwhelms.

40:25.260 --> 40:29.770
But the greatest destroyer
of all...

40:29.770 --> 40:32.060
is love.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.900
Don't worry.

40:36.900 --> 40:40.530
It will all be painfully clear
soon enough.

40:41.660 --> 40:44.030
Now that the boy is away
from Malivore's grasp,

40:44.030 --> 40:46.160
my work here is done.

40:47.790 --> 40:50.620
Until we meet again.

41:09.310 --> 41:12.020
(guttural growling)
