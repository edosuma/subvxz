00:06.318 --> 00:08.878
Daddy, can we take Nicky with us
to graduation?

00:08.954 --> 00:12.583
No, I don't think so, sweetheart.
But maybe Geoffrey can baby-sit for him.

00:12.658 --> 00:17.118
Of course, sir. And, no,
I wouldn't mind missing the ceremony.

00:17.529 --> 00:21.932
Why should I be invited to such
an illustrious event after a mere 15 years...

00:22.000 --> 00:25.436
of wiping, picking
and sucking up after you all?

00:28.540 --> 00:31.475
Geoffrey, we would love for you to come
to graduation with us.

00:31.543 --> 00:33.340
I'll have to check my book.

00:34.613 --> 00:36.581
Geoffrey, you're coming.

00:36.848 --> 00:39.316
But you know,
your mother's not feeling well and...

00:39.384 --> 00:41.443
I don't feel right
leaving Nicky with a stranger.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.509
I could take care of him.

00:42.588 --> 00:45.056
Y eah, but who's going to
take care of you?

00:45.390 --> 00:47.824
Y eah, come on, Hilary.
Plus, you can't miss the ceremony...

00:47.893 --> 00:50.157
hard as I've worked to graduate.

00:50.228 --> 00:53.254
Man, you know how hard it is
to take a test like this?

00:56.435 --> 00:59.302
Guess what? I'm the class valedictorian.

01:02.641 --> 01:03.869
What does that mean?

01:06.712 --> 01:10.273
I believe it's Latin for
"little short midget with a square head."

02:23.722 --> 02:24.950
Now...

02:25.023 --> 02:28.823
what was Antonio Vivaldi
trying to tell us in this concerto?

02:29.027 --> 02:32.360
Come on, baby, I'm saying, "Bing-bang-
bluesy, me and you in the Jacuzzi."

02:32.431 --> 02:33.523
What's up?

02:34.266 --> 02:38.464
Mr. Smith. The concerto?
What was Vivaldi saying?

02:38.937 --> 02:42.930
Well, actually, Mrs. Bassin,
I'm glad you asked me that.

02:45.444 --> 02:49.710
Vivaldi, or "Vival Dee" as it is pronounced
in some <i>E</i> uropean circles...

02:51.383 --> 02:53.544
I believe he was commenting on...

02:53.618 --> 02:56.109
man's inhumanity toward man.

02:56.688 --> 02:59.248
That we...

03:01.393 --> 03:05.090
citizens of America,
the richest country on this planet...

03:05.330 --> 03:09.426
have a moral obligation that
goes far beyond buying the...

03:09.501 --> 03:10.968
newest car...

03:11.436 --> 03:15.167
or purchasing the latest
Naughty By Nature CD.

03:17.275 --> 03:20.676
If one child goes hungry...

03:22.647 --> 03:24.171
we must feed it.

03:28.887 --> 03:31.287
If one child shivers...

03:35.694 --> 03:38.595
we must shelter it.

03:40.899 --> 03:42.628
And I, for one...

03:43.735 --> 03:46.329
believe the brother knew
what he was talking about.

03:47.305 --> 03:52.038
Vivaldi died in 1741
before there was a United States.

03:53.178 --> 03:55.078
But the dream is alive.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.408
More on Vivaldi tomorrow.

04:03.421 --> 04:05.548
Mr. Smith, may I have
a word with you, please?

04:05.624 --> 04:07.489
- Y es, I was just...
- Mr. Smith.

04:09.861 --> 04:13.092
Mrs. Bassin, I'm sorry,
I was acting silly today.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.894
I'll make it up tomorrow.

04:14.966 --> 04:18.902
Too little too late.
Will, I'm going to have to fail you.

04:20.272 --> 04:22.103
The "F" word. Why?

04:22.774 --> 04:24.298
Y ou missed half the semester.

04:24.376 --> 04:25.900
What's your point?

04:26.244 --> 04:29.111
Will, you have 10 classes to make up...

04:29.181 --> 04:31.615
and only five before graduation.

04:32.250 --> 04:36.209
Listen, Mrs. Bassin,
I'm telling you, I'll make up the work.

04:36.288 --> 04:37.949
Come on, I have to graduate.

04:38.023 --> 04:41.117
I'm sorry, but you have
no one to blame but yourself.

04:43.128 --> 04:44.254
Listen, Mrs. Bassin...

04:44.329 --> 04:46.661
I don't think you understand.
My Mom is flying out from...

04:46.731 --> 04:48.426
Philly to see me graduate.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.764
I mean, the woman that gave me life.

04:51.036 --> 04:53.197
And if I don't graduate, she'll take it back.

04:58.143 --> 05:00.236
Listen, I'll make up the work.

05:00.312 --> 05:04.339
Y ou don't have time.
And besides, there's no way you could...

05:04.416 --> 05:07.579
keep up with my accelerated class.
It's over.

05:08.053 --> 05:11.113
Look, Mrs. Bassin, listen, come on.

05:11.189 --> 05:12.554
This is me.

05:13.658 --> 05:16.092
I'm sinking.
Please give me another chance. Please?

05:16.161 --> 05:17.423
Come on.

05:19.464 --> 05:20.931
All right, be here tomorrow at 5:00.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.899
- Y es...
- But no promises.

05:23.001 --> 05:24.730
Thanks a lot, Mrs. Bassin.

05:25.170 --> 05:28.799
Wait a minute. <i>Batman</i> comes on at 5:00.
Can we make it at 6:30?

05:28.874 --> 05:31.001
- I'm joking. I'm stupid.
- I know.

05:38.416 --> 05:43.012
So, Janine, when did you first decide
you wanted to take care of children?

05:43.989 --> 05:47.755
When I was so instructed by
the Lord of the <i>E</i> ighth Circle.

05:55.267 --> 05:59.897
So, Lindsay, when did you first decide
you wanted to take care of children?

06:02.607 --> 06:05.542
I guess, shortly after my release.

06:11.516 --> 06:14.451
Please! What do you know
about taking care of babies?

06:15.921 --> 06:18.481
Babies? I'm here to take care of Hilary.

06:27.966 --> 06:29.399
Hey, did my Mom get here yet?

06:29.467 --> 06:31.560
Geoffrey's picking her up from the airport.

06:31.636 --> 06:35.629
Will, I've been meaning to ask you.
What do you want for graduation?

06:36.074 --> 06:38.872
Would you all stop with
the interrogation, please?

06:40.478 --> 06:42.139
Obviously, some of us can handle...

06:42.213 --> 06:44.511
the pressures of graduation
better than others.

06:44.582 --> 06:48.074
Pressure? Look, man,
I'm not feeling no pressure, okay?

06:48.920 --> 06:52.253
Thank God you're not giving the speech.
It's an immense responsibility...

06:52.324 --> 06:53.814
one I face with great humility.

06:54.159 --> 06:57.390
But do I shirk it? No.
Because somehow deep down I know...

06:57.462 --> 06:59.396
anyone else would really bite.

07:00.665 --> 07:04.726
Gosh, Carlton, you're so confident.
I'd be too nervous to be valedictorian.

07:05.737 --> 07:08.900
Nervous? Why?

07:11.009 --> 07:14.706
Why? I mean to have all those people
staring at you.

07:15.046 --> 07:17.674
I mean, people stare at me all the time,
but I'm pretty.

07:20.752 --> 07:23.880
I guess that spandex shirt
don't got nothing to do with it, huh?

07:27.325 --> 07:29.452
Aren't you afraid
you're going to mess up?

07:30.462 --> 07:31.952
Not a problem.

07:32.130 --> 07:33.757
Well, I'd be worried.

07:33.898 --> 07:37.356
Y eah, every kid hoping you make a fool
of yourself, every parent wondering...

07:37.435 --> 07:40.529
what you're doing up at the podium
and why you're sweating so much?

07:43.375 --> 07:46.310
Y o, C, come on, man, you ain't got
to worry about none of that.

07:46.378 --> 07:49.074
But I would worry about slipping off
them stack of phone books...

07:49.147 --> 07:51.012
you going to be standing on.

07:51.349 --> 07:52.907
Heck, you guys.

07:54.285 --> 07:55.274
Heck!

07:59.224 --> 08:01.658
Y ou're very, very brave.

08:02.193 --> 08:04.058
We're so proud of you.

08:05.964 --> 08:10.731
Oh, God, I'm short, I'm sweaty
and I can't grow chest hair.

08:12.604 --> 08:14.731
Oh, my goodness, is that a bald spot?

08:17.175 --> 08:20.406
Oh, there he is, my graduate!

08:21.046 --> 08:22.138
Hey, Ma.

08:23.715 --> 08:27.310
Y ou're my pride and joy, sweetie.
This means everything to me.

08:27.919 --> 08:31.946
I never thought I'd live to see this day,
but here I am and there you are.

08:32.023 --> 08:34.321
Now, smile and say, "diploma."

08:34.392 --> 08:37.623
Look, Mom, this is just a little graduation.

08:37.695 --> 08:39.686
I think you're making
a little too much of it.

08:39.764 --> 08:43.291
Boy, are you crazy? I've been waiting
18 years for this moment.

08:43.368 --> 08:47.065
Come on, Mom, you must have done
something else in all that time.

08:47.939 --> 08:50.601
Nothing more important than this.

08:50.708 --> 08:53.404
Apparently, you've never danced
the Achy Breaky.

08:57.215 --> 09:00.275
Will, completing high school
was a great achievement.

09:00.452 --> 09:02.852
Y ou've made me so happy I could cry.

09:04.422 --> 09:05.787
Y eah, me too.

09:13.364 --> 09:14.353
Boo!

09:14.699 --> 09:18.328
Will, where have you been?
I haven't seen you in music class.

09:18.570 --> 09:22.404
Y ou ain't heard? Mrs. Bassin
brought me up to her advanced class.

09:24.008 --> 09:26.909
Y ou know, Will, you are so talented.

09:27.345 --> 09:29.813
Y eah, and I'm pretty good at music, too,
you know?

09:29.881 --> 09:32.782
- Don't be silly.
- Get on out of here before I do something.

09:37.755 --> 09:39.586
Will, you made it.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.487
Class, say hello to Will.

09:43.561 --> 09:46.359
He'll be joining us
until the end of the semester.

09:46.898 --> 09:49.423
Great. Another high school dropout.

09:59.377 --> 10:01.709
Okay, now, before we start our scales...

10:01.779 --> 10:04.407
can anyone tell me
what "pizzicato" means?

10:07.085 --> 10:08.177
Mr. Smith.

10:08.386 --> 10:10.377
Mr. Smith? Y ou got all these...

10:14.959 --> 10:15.948
Sure...

10:17.095 --> 10:20.030
pizzicato, that's a...

10:20.431 --> 10:22.092
pizza with avocado.

10:24.335 --> 10:26.735
Get it, I said, it's a pizza...

10:28.673 --> 10:29.799
Michael.

10:31.009 --> 10:34.740
Pizzicato: A term indicating that
strings should be plucked, not bowed.

10:41.786 --> 10:43.913
Well, there ain't no Santa Claus.

10:57.435 --> 11:00.029
Another slice for you, Master William?

11:00.205 --> 11:02.639
No thanks, G, I'm not hungry.

11:03.107 --> 11:06.907
<i>That's funny.</i>
<i>Wi// a/ways has seconds at home.</i>

11:15.753 --> 11:16.777
G...

11:17.255 --> 11:20.224
I am this close to not graduating, man.

11:20.658 --> 11:22.523
I think my music teacher
has got it out for me.

11:22.594 --> 11:25.222
She's trying to force me
to make up 10 hours.

11:25.697 --> 11:28.928
Come on, it ain't like I got
a future in music or nothing.

11:31.269 --> 11:34.932
Well, I sincerely hope you graduate.

11:35.106 --> 11:36.596
Thanks a lot, G, that means a lot to me.

11:36.674 --> 11:40.337
Because if you're left back and I have
to wash your gym socks for another year...

11:40.411 --> 11:42.174
I shall take my own life.

11:44.549 --> 11:45.811
Surprise!

11:46.884 --> 11:48.408
Look, Mom, what is this?

11:48.486 --> 11:50.784
Y our four-days-before-graduation gift.

11:51.656 --> 11:53.954
Look, Mom, this has got to stop.

11:57.996 --> 12:00.430
There wouldn't happen to be
no car keys in here would there?

12:00.498 --> 12:02.796
- No.
- Then this has got to stop, Mom.

12:05.336 --> 12:09.272
I know, I'm getting a little carried away,
but I'm just so proud of you.

12:09.474 --> 12:11.908
Y our graduation is very important to me.

12:12.243 --> 12:14.803
But, Mom, it wouldn't be
if you got out more.

12:17.048 --> 12:20.814
- I know what's going on here.
- Y ou do?

12:22.587 --> 12:24.919
Y ou're trying to downplay graduation...

12:24.989 --> 12:29.619
because you don't want me to feel bad
that I never got a chance to graduate.

12:30.261 --> 12:34.493
Oh, God, my life is over.
I wish I'd never been made valedictorian.

12:34.966 --> 12:37.264
Carlton, come on, you're going to do fine.

12:37.335 --> 12:40.793
Now, when you're up there, just
picture someone that you really admire...

12:40.872 --> 12:44.069
watching you with love and approval.
Go on, try it.

12:49.013 --> 12:51.948
It's no good.
The only thing I can picture is...

12:52.016 --> 12:54.211
someone laughing and pointing at me.

12:54.886 --> 12:57.047
Carlton, now you stop that man,
that is not...

12:57.121 --> 12:59.919
going to happen to you
when you give that speech.

13:00.558 --> 13:02.651
That's going to happen to you
on your wedding night.

13:08.599 --> 13:12.035
Okay, kids,
today we're going to choose up teams...

13:12.103 --> 13:14.628
and play musical jeopardy.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.970
Now, who wants to be our two captains?

13:17.075 --> 13:19.168
Right here, Mrs. Bassin.

13:19.844 --> 13:21.505
Nancy and Michael.

13:26.317 --> 13:29.946
Two players left. Make your choice.

13:42.133 --> 13:43.964
Come on, man, you got to pick me.

13:44.035 --> 13:46.265
All right, stop your whining.

13:48.506 --> 13:50.770
Now for the final question...

13:50.842 --> 13:54.039
the answer is: A clef.

13:55.113 --> 13:56.637
I know!

13:57.215 --> 14:00.480
What is that thing
Michael Jackson had built into his chin?

14:03.755 --> 14:04.915
Nancy.

14:05.156 --> 14:09.786
What is the character that indicates
the pitch of a particular line on a staff?

14:09.961 --> 14:12.054
That's right. Congratulations.

14:12.130 --> 14:14.121
- Y es!
- Y our team wins.

14:18.836 --> 14:21.669
- What are you looking at?
- Not much.

14:25.276 --> 14:27.744
Look, man, we can take this out
to the monkey bars.

14:27.812 --> 14:29.404
Any time, any place.

14:29.514 --> 14:31.414
I'm just kidding, you're the man.

14:31.482 --> 14:34.474
Okay, students, don't forget
to get here early tomorrow...

14:34.552 --> 14:37.487
so you can be measured for
your costumes for the recital.

14:41.325 --> 14:43.225
- Recital?
- That's right.

14:44.762 --> 14:48.664
Mrs. Bassin, my sister, listen...

14:48.733 --> 14:51.293
I appreciate everything you're trying
to do for me, but look...

14:51.369 --> 14:54.964
I am not about the embarrass myself
in front of a group of strangers.

14:55.039 --> 14:57.166
Mr. Smith, my brother...

14:57.809 --> 15:01.245
you're not going to embarrass yourself
in front of a group of strangers.

15:01.312 --> 15:02.643
That's what I said.

15:02.713 --> 15:05.705
Y ou'll be performing
for your friends at graduation.

15:06.951 --> 15:08.680
Are you tripping? No way.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.755
Then you won't be able to graduate,
I'm afraid.

15:14.659 --> 15:18.755
Then I'm afraid I'm not going to
be able to sign your yearbook!

15:26.003 --> 15:28.972
Look, all right?
Now, I know the two of you are upset...

15:29.040 --> 15:31.065
about me not graduating, okay?

15:31.209 --> 15:33.473
But you'll get over it. Y ou'll have to.

15:33.544 --> 15:35.671
All right? 'Cause I made up my mind...

15:36.047 --> 15:39.210
and nothing either of you can say
is going to change that.

15:39.283 --> 15:41.012
Okay? 'Cause I'm a man.

15:41.219 --> 15:44.552
All right? With strong man emotions.

15:46.557 --> 15:49.048
And there is no way that this man...

15:49.327 --> 15:52.854
is going to get up on that stage
and embarrass himself at graduation.

15:52.930 --> 15:54.955
No.

16:24.228 --> 16:28.460
Good luck, sweetie. I'm so proud of you.

16:30.401 --> 16:31.766
Mama's boy.

16:34.472 --> 16:37.999
Okay, kids, I'm going to announce you.
So, take your marks.

16:46.350 --> 16:48.079
Where are you guys going?

16:48.352 --> 16:50.513
Come on, don't you guys want
to go out there and see...

16:50.588 --> 16:52.647
Uncle Willie make a fool out of himself?

16:52.723 --> 16:54.156
What's wrong?

16:54.225 --> 16:56.318
Those are people out there.

16:58.429 --> 17:02.024
All this time y'all thought we was
going to be performing for some Smurfs?

17:03.501 --> 17:06.402
Okay, come on, look,
let's just pretend it's another rehearsal.

17:06.470 --> 17:08.961
Forget it, we're not ready for the public.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.736
How do you think I feel?

17:13.010 --> 17:15.604
We've got our futures to think about.

17:15.813 --> 17:17.747
Listen, I don't think you guys understand.

17:17.815 --> 17:20.443
If we don't get out there,
I'm not going to graduate.

17:20.518 --> 17:22.247
Y ou're breaking my heart.

17:23.487 --> 17:25.011
And you're so cute.

17:25.957 --> 17:29.324
And if you guys don't let me graduate,
then I might have to mess y'all up.

17:29.393 --> 17:30.587
Show on!

17:43.841 --> 17:46.309
Today for your listening pleasure...

17:46.377 --> 17:49.938
let us welcome
the Little Rays of Sunshine.

17:53.117 --> 17:55.585
That's my Jessie, the one with the braids.

17:56.087 --> 17:58.578
That's my Will,
the one with the mustache.

18:31.255 --> 18:33.780
Hey, Mike, can we get
a little James Brown?

18:36.861 --> 18:40.092
I didn't hear you.
I said, "Can we get a little James Brown?"

18:51.976 --> 18:53.170
Now, here we go.

19:28.479 --> 19:31.607
Say, Maestro, can we get
a little walking music?

19:33.017 --> 19:34.211
Posse out!

19:44.295 --> 19:47.458
Thanks, Will, you got us
through a tough one.

19:53.237 --> 19:54.295
Okay.

19:54.505 --> 19:57.804
I guess that means
you're noticing how truly fly I am.

19:57.975 --> 20:00.375
Speaking of flies, yours is open.

20:00.444 --> 20:02.378
A tutu fly.

20:04.782 --> 20:06.443
Well, Will...

20:07.818 --> 20:09.683
- congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:09.787 --> 20:13.120
Y ou can walk with your classmates.
I'm passing you.

20:13.190 --> 20:15.215
- Hey, thanks a lot, Mrs. Bassin.
- Y ou're welcome.

20:15.292 --> 20:18.159
And trust me,
I learned a valuable lesson from this.

20:18.229 --> 20:19.753
What's that?

20:20.798 --> 20:22.891
I ain't never having no kids.

20:24.268 --> 20:26.793
Good luck. Come on, kids. Let's go.

20:28.305 --> 20:30.830
Hey, Will, I caught your act.

20:31.509 --> 20:33.067
Baby, listen, check it out, I can...

20:33.144 --> 20:35.271
y ou know, you really surprised me.

20:35.613 --> 20:39.743
That was the most sensitive,
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

20:40.751 --> 20:44.619
And nothing turns me on more
than sensitivity in a man.

20:46.757 --> 20:49.157
Oh, girl, you don't know the half of it.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.490
Let me tell you
I be boo-hooing during <i>Lassie.</i>

20:54.965 --> 20:57.229
<i>Before / came here today, / was afraid...</i>

20:57.301 --> 21:02.068
<i>as /'m sure many of you are. /t seems</i>
<i>these days, there's a /ot to be afraid of.</i>

21:02.339 --> 21:04.637
<i>The wor/d can be a pretty scary p/ace.</i>

21:04.708 --> 21:07.006
<i>But how can one person</i>
<i>make a difference?</i>

21:07.077 --> 21:08.669
<i>We//, /'// te// you what /'m going to do.</i>

21:08.746 --> 21:11.306
<i>/'m going to take the education</i>
<i>/ received here...</i>

21:11.382 --> 21:14.112
<i>and use it to give back</i>
<i>to those /ess fortunate.</i>

21:14.385 --> 21:18.151
Y our cousin's really deep and
he doesn't even seem nervous.

21:18.856 --> 21:21.882
Y eah, see, check it out.
I gave him a little advice.

21:21.992 --> 21:25.428
I told him to picture somebody
that he really admires.

21:25.629 --> 21:28.962
And, you know, he probably picturing me.

21:30.768 --> 21:32.292
<i>And in c/osing...</i>

21:35.873 --> 21:39.707
<i>/'d /ike to thank my teachers</i>
<i>and my c/assmates for four great years.</i>

21:40.211 --> 21:42.611
<i>And my fami/y for their /ove and support.</i>

21:43.214 --> 21:45.239
<i>And, my best friend...</i>

21:46.183 --> 21:48.174
<i>someone who stuck beside me...</i>

21:48.719 --> 21:50.619
<i>and kept me out of troub/e...</i>

21:50.955 --> 21:53.583
<i>and maybe got me into</i>
<i>a /itt/e bit of it, too.</i>

21:54.258 --> 21:55.623
<i>Congratu/ations.</i>

22:05.135 --> 22:06.568
<i>Lisa Armstrong.</i>

22:09.773 --> 22:11.104
<i>Adam Baker.</i>

22:14.278 --> 22:15.768
<i>Car/ton Banks.</i>

22:23.787 --> 22:25.186
<i>John Simpson.</i>

22:29.159 --> 22:30.319
<i>Wi// Smith.</i>

22:48.345 --> 22:51.746
Now, when you're up there, just picture
someone that you really admire...

22:51.815 --> 22:55.182
watching you with love and approval.
Go on, try it.

23:09.099 --> 23:11.192
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. I'm sorry.
