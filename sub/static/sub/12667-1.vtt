00:46.305 --> 00:47.468
Robin.

00:48.724 --> 00:50.006
Look at me, Robin.

00:54.272 --> 00:56.727
Do you believe when I say I love you?

00:58.025 --> 01:00.778
How long has this been going on?

01:01.404 --> 01:03.563
24 years? 25?

01:04.239 --> 01:06.197
I've always been there for you.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.740
Always, in any situation.

01:09.162 --> 01:12.246
To all your... choices, all your fears...

01:12.832 --> 01:13.829
all that...

01:14.625 --> 01:17.959
enslavement here, anxieties, I was there.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.588
All the irrational walkouts,

01:21.132 --> 01:24.300
always when... shooting was
just about to start.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.180
"Do me a favor, Al, get me out of this,
get me out of that".

01:27.263 --> 01:28.639
"Get me out clean",

01:28.723 --> 01:30.639
"without burning any bridges".

01:31.893 --> 01:33.969
"Aaron needs me at home."

01:36.022 --> 01:38.062
But Aaron is just an excuse.

01:39.984 --> 01:41.714
Lousy choices.

01:42.987 --> 01:45.360
That's your whole story, Robin.

01:45.894 --> 01:47.444
Lousy choices.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.743
Lousy movies,

01:50.011 --> 01:52.948
lousy men, friends you couldn't trust.

01:53.299 --> 01:55.204
Even the one thing you can't choose,

01:55.288 --> 01:56.288
your mother.

01:57.376 --> 01:59.156
You made a lousy choice there, too.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.074
You had it all, Robin.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.166
Movie queen at 24.

02:06.987 --> 02:09.484
All the big studios came crawling.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.240
Maybe I was too soft on you...

02:16.536 --> 02:17.790
like everyone says.

02:20.358 --> 02:21.473
I don't know.

02:23.569 --> 02:25.277
Maybe I really was.

02:27.738 --> 02:29.295
But you were just a kid.

02:30.271 --> 02:31.489
You were scared.

02:31.702 --> 02:34.076
You made that choices,
you made them all on your own.

02:34.372 --> 02:36.448
And you slammed all the open doors,

02:36.666 --> 02:38.187
crushed all the dreams.

02:40.711 --> 02:41.791
And now...

02:44.048 --> 02:44.961
Now...

02:46.261 --> 02:47.579
And now what, Al?

02:48.732 --> 02:50.761
Talk to me, what are they offering?

02:51.248 --> 02:54.140
I've no idea that they offer,
I wish I knew.

02:54.350 --> 02:56.602
They called this morning
and yelled at me for 20 minutes,

02:56.825 --> 02:58.477
about how they're sick of us.

02:58.688 --> 03:00.381
Said it was a "final offer",

03:01.145 --> 03:02.935
that this proposal won't be on the table again.

03:04.159 --> 03:06.654
A quotation: "That won't be on the table again."

03:06.863 --> 03:08.342
And what do you think it is?

03:08.426 --> 03:10.066
How on Earth would I know?

03:10.950 --> 03:13.592
One thing I do know: they won't be back.

03:15.413 --> 03:17.821
They never spoke to me that way, Robin.

03:18.036 --> 03:18.893
Ever.

03:19.584 --> 03:21.878
Sorry of that, Mom.
I think you need to go now.

03:21.961 --> 03:22.709
What happened?

03:23.004 --> 03:25.424
Airport security called. No pressure,
same as usual.

03:56.755 --> 03:57.575
Aaron!

04:32.423 --> 04:34.613
That's right. The next time the
kite goes over property fence,

04:34.696 --> 04:35.827
- you know what's gonna happen.
- I know.

04:36.035 --> 04:37.992
I know, I'm sorry,
it's not going to happen again.

05:06.941 --> 05:08.353
So what was that Aaron?

05:08.568 --> 05:11.023
United 435 from Rochester?

05:12.238 --> 05:13.401
Actually, no.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.257
- What was it then?
- Um...

05:16.576 --> 05:18.595
United... but not Rochester.

05:19.078 --> 05:19.996
Let's see...

05:20.079 --> 05:22.546
Wednesday, 6 p.m.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.620
Fort Lauderdale?

05:26.002 --> 05:27.200
I know, Minneapolis.

05:29.881 --> 05:32.585
- That's not what matters.
- What matters then?

05:35.428 --> 05:37.587
That the wind was blowing from the west,

05:38.910 --> 05:41.776
that my lady flew like a Queen
over the runways...

05:41.976 --> 05:44.349
and that it looked like a match made in Heaven.

05:46.167 --> 05:48.184
I thought that any minute
they were gonna unite.

05:49.066 --> 05:50.312
Those colors!

05:50.860 --> 05:51.809
That red,

05:52.195 --> 05:53.143
that white

05:53.738 --> 05:55.197
and the black clouds.

05:57.404 --> 05:58.571
So really powerful.

05:58.654 --> 05:59.983
OK, but guess what?

06:00.066 --> 06:02.095
It's not gonna happen anymore,
you know that, right?

06:02.288 --> 06:03.137
Why not, why do you care?

06:03.162 --> 06:05.606
Because he's not gonna go there,
that's why it's not gonna happen.

06:07.035 --> 06:09.675
All right? Because the next time
the line goes over the fence,

06:09.758 --> 06:11.445
we're gonna have to pack
everything in the house

06:11.714 --> 06:13.707
we're gonna have to move to
a lousy neighborhood in the city,

06:13.925 --> 06:16.135
where there will be no sky for you to see, or kites.

06:16.219 --> 06:19.007
I'd rather live in some lousy neighborhood
in the city than this shit.

06:19.806 --> 06:21.217
Oh, that's not new.

06:23.976 --> 06:25.493
You know, I saved you today.

06:26.145 --> 06:27.059
You saved me? From what?

06:27.522 --> 06:28.933
From Al's proposal.

06:29.565 --> 06:31.118
What was he offering so sweetly?

06:35.530 --> 06:36.277
Tell her, Mom.

06:36.572 --> 06:39.277
- What did he offer?
- I DON'T know, I don't know.

06:39.784 --> 06:41.503
Sci-Fi? Graphic novel?

06:41.587 --> 06:44.154
Holocaust? I don't see WHY you won't
do a Holocaust flick?

06:44.539 --> 06:47.203
Every B-grade actress that does Holocaust
wins something in.

06:48.167 --> 06:49.994
You could play both sides.

06:50.211 --> 06:51.243
What do you mean, both sides?

06:51.546 --> 06:53.123
Well, look at you.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.937
Nazi and victim.

06:56.676 --> 06:58.621
You're multi-purpose
for a Holocaust flick.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.349
- You know what?
- What?

07:00.433 --> 07:03.352
You could even play a collaborator
if they needed one.

07:03.436 --> 07:06.268
How many actresses have THAT
kind of talent these days?

07:44.637 --> 07:48.267
Yeah, I remember. I remember when you
first came to the studio.

07:48.478 --> 07:50.646
I was a... young number-cruncher,

07:50.730 --> 07:51.892
down the hall.

07:52.783 --> 07:54.461
Everybody said: "Here she comes!"

07:54.544 --> 07:56.816
"She is beautiful, she is sexy,

07:56.899 --> 07:59.739
She's got brains, power and ability

07:59.822 --> 08:02.133
modesty, wildness, fantasy."

08:06.496 --> 08:08.748
And she's one of us, goddamn it, she's...

08:08.831 --> 08:10.114
She's from Texas!"

08:11.626 --> 08:15.754
She's not some-some... some actress
that comes from the middle of Australia

08:15.963 --> 08:17.755
that grew up on some distant farm,

08:17.838 --> 08:20.670
that she rode a hundred miles
to get to closest movie

08:20.885 --> 08:23.294
where the projector runs on bunker fuel!

08:25.765 --> 08:28.600
I remember, standing in the hallway...

08:29.018 --> 08:30.726
watching you walk in.

08:30.937 --> 08:32.808
And you were so beautiful.

08:34.398 --> 08:37.229
You were "Princess Bride"... Buttercup.

08:38.820 --> 08:42.318
I imagined switching your face
for that of Grace Kelly's,

08:42.532 --> 08:45.221
in the "Rear Window" poster. That was a good idea.

08:46.619 --> 08:47.956
You were the future, Robin.

08:48.955 --> 08:51.280
You were the promise, the answer.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.910
You were the whole package.

08:56.754 --> 08:57.952
And now I'm...

08:59.257 --> 09:01.167
I'm in this situation.

09:02.051 --> 09:04.257
Exactly what situation are you in, Jeff?

09:05.054 --> 09:08.341
The situation of offering you the last contract
that you'll ever have.

09:10.613 --> 09:11.764
The last?

09:12.186 --> 09:14.227
Already? I'm not even 45.

09:14.522 --> 09:16.432
Things are changing quickly.

09:17.316 --> 09:20.935
Very soon, this whole structure
we all love so much...

09:21.154 --> 09:22.352
will be gone.

09:22.572 --> 09:24.316
What's... Miramount?

09:26.742 --> 09:27.618
God forbid!

09:28.286 --> 09:30.304
I mean the structure around the actor:

09:30.590 --> 09:32.278
the agents, the managers,

09:32.498 --> 09:33.993
all the trappings, the trailer

09:34.208 --> 09:36.961
the drugs, the Coke, the depression, the...

09:37.170 --> 09:40.131
breakups, the lovers, the sexual kinks,

09:40.214 --> 09:41.543
the broken contracts,

09:41.757 --> 09:44.485
the terrible legitimization of tasteless scripts,

09:44.569 --> 09:47.638
the post-failure blues, the skipping out on PR

09:47.722 --> 09:49.549
begging for forgiveness.

09:49.765 --> 09:51.749
All that... can be gone.

09:56.583 --> 09:57.660
Get my drift?

09:58.733 --> 10:00.192
No, not really.

10:03.988 --> 10:05.787
We at Miramount, want to...

10:06.532 --> 10:07.786
want to scan you.

10:08.409 --> 10:12.038
All of you... your body, your face,
your... emotion,

10:12.246 --> 10:15.958
your laughter, your tears,
your climaxing, your happiness,

10:16.042 --> 10:20.196
your depressions, your... fears, longings.

10:21.631 --> 10:25.453
We want to sample you, we
want to preserve you, we want...

10:25.885 --> 10:27.261
all this, this...

10:27.345 --> 10:29.421
this thing, this thing called...

10:30.181 --> 10:31.090
"Robin Wright".

10:34.779 --> 10:37.012
What will you do with this... thing?

10:37.438 --> 10:38.938
That you call Robin Wright?

10:39.440 --> 10:42.387
Will do all the things that
your Robin Wright wouldn't do.

10:43.694 --> 10:44.450
Like what?

10:45.363 --> 10:47.722
Like all the movies that you missed out on

10:47.806 --> 10:49.700
because of your LOUSY choices.

10:49.784 --> 10:52.286
You gave in, you gave up, you fled, you quit,

10:52.370 --> 10:53.912
God knows what you did!

10:53.995 --> 10:55.575
And you did it the last minute,

10:55.658 --> 10:58.649
you clogged our productions
and you cost us MILLIONS!

11:03.339 --> 11:04.206
How old are you?

11:06.217 --> 11:09.116
What difference does it make how old I am,
if you're gonna create

11:09.413 --> 11:13.422
me at any age at your computer! What difference
does it make to you if I am 16 or 60?

11:13.641 --> 11:14.401
It doesn't.

11:15.367 --> 11:18.435
I need Buttercup from "Princess Bride".

11:19.063 --> 11:21.303
I need Jenny from "Forrest Gump."

11:21.386 --> 11:23.266
I need a... what was her name,

11:23.350 --> 11:25.238
from "A State Of Grace"?

11:25.321 --> 11:27.127
That's what I need, I don't need you.

11:29.198 --> 11:31.239
I need you only for your... for your history.

11:31.576 --> 11:34.385
A history paid with lousy choices
you just said so yourself.

11:34.468 --> 11:36.959
Yes. For the last 15 years, yes, sure.

11:37.043 --> 11:39.171
All your movies tanked, no-not one...

11:39.474 --> 11:40.955
could keep it's head above water.

11:42.044 --> 11:45.140
But I can save you, Robin.
I can save you.

11:45.897 --> 11:49.040
- From what?
- From yourself! From yourself!

11:53.598 --> 11:54.760
You knew about this?

11:56.350 --> 11:57.050
Knew about what?

11:57.351 --> 11:59.173
About all this crap he's offering me?

11:59.353 --> 12:03.349
Oh, he doesn't know anything, he still thinks
that cameras run on bunker fuel.

12:05.318 --> 12:06.017
On what?

12:06.444 --> 12:08.246
A bunker fuel, that's crude oil.

12:08.558 --> 12:10.770
Never mind. He is from the Stone Age.

12:15.703 --> 12:17.530
Your career is almost over.

12:18.372 --> 12:20.982
You fell off the Top-O.

12:22.556 --> 12:24.730
In the economy of scanned actors, um...

12:25.880 --> 12:28.205
you're not worth... 2 bucks.

12:29.926 --> 12:31.503
We're at war, Robin.

12:31.803 --> 12:35.854
Any actor who doesn't sign within
the next 6 months is dead. Gone.

12:36.599 --> 12:39.268
Characters erased from the screen forever.

12:41.479 --> 12:43.852
You'll be back on all fours,

12:44.065 --> 12:45.632
begging me to sample you.

12:49.403 --> 12:51.729
What is it that I have to do
to make that happen?

12:51.889 --> 12:52.497
Nothing.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.695
Just sign.

12:55.910 --> 12:56.740
Half a day of scanning.

12:57.078 --> 12:58.703
- That's it?
- That's it.

12:59.288 --> 13:01.958
That and... you must agree to never act again.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.825
Anywhere for all eternity.

13:06.796 --> 13:08.255
What do you mean, "anywhere"?

13:08.881 --> 13:11.509
No movies, no TV show,

13:11.592 --> 13:14.428
no school plays, no French theater

13:14.512 --> 13:15.793
in Western Australia?

13:15.877 --> 13:17.761
"Anywhere" means Anywhere.

13:20.643 --> 13:23.415
Robin Wright The Actress will live and breathe...

13:23.498 --> 13:25.972
within the walls of Miramount Studios.

13:27.215 --> 13:29.982
And this Robin Wright can take the money

13:30.192 --> 13:33.030
and fly off to some island in Polynesia

13:33.114 --> 13:34.739
to discover her true self.

13:37.792 --> 13:38.953
Whadda you say?

13:42.415 --> 13:44.222
You know, it's interesting. Um...

13:44.858 --> 13:46.757
We actresses used to talk about how we never

13:46.840 --> 13:48.840
wanted to sleep with you for a part
in the movie, but

13:48.923 --> 13:51.239
but you know what? Honestly, I think
I'd rather do that...

13:51.942 --> 13:54.503
than be a fucking chip in your computer, Jeff.

13:56.637 --> 13:57.800
So, thanks.

13:58.556 --> 13:59.635
But, no thanks.

14:08.024 --> 14:09.815
The offer is valid for 30 days.

14:10.026 --> 14:11.215
After that, she's on her own.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.343
How do you feel, sweetie?

14:46.979 --> 14:48.261
What's up?

14:55.638 --> 14:57.364
I was tired, I guess.

14:58.908 --> 15:01.338
You want to try and fly the Wright brothers' glider?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.244
No... she's not ready yet.

15:05.498 --> 15:07.455
So maybe one of the Cody's?

15:10.211 --> 15:11.457
I don't know.

15:17.718 --> 15:19.292
I missed the 2 o'clock landing.

15:24.225 --> 15:25.423
What's wrong?

15:28.271 --> 15:30.291
You look... you look sad.

15:30.754 --> 15:31.962
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:36.529 --> 15:38.819
Why don't you fly one of Cody Bank's?

15:39.490 --> 15:40.540
- Me?
- Yeah.

15:40.741 --> 15:42.948
- I don't think so.
- You can do it.

15:44.745 --> 15:46.027
Just the little one.

15:47.582 --> 15:48.697
Come on.

15:49.584 --> 15:51.992
You better try it for once, alone.

15:53.004 --> 15:54.534
Gotta see what it feels like.

15:57.466 --> 15:59.009
I'll be there and watch your line,

16:00.052 --> 16:01.367
so it doesn't go over that fence.

16:03.431 --> 16:05.382
Don't want to get kicked out of this place, do we?

17:15.837 --> 17:17.117
Sarah, get it.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.292
Me?

17:18.506 --> 17:20.381
Did you ever see someone come to visit me here?

17:20.633 --> 17:22.045
Right, here, hold this.

17:31.853 --> 17:33.229
It's okay.

17:37.278 --> 17:38.442
You could call.

17:38.526 --> 17:40.676
What good would that have done?
You haven't answered my calls

17:40.759 --> 17:42.189
since the meeting at the studio.

17:42.655 --> 17:46.325
This is Steve. He'll draw up
your contract with the studio.

17:46.409 --> 17:48.200
He's a scanning contract genius.

17:48.411 --> 17:51.002
Keanu Reeves, Michelle Williams...
he did their contracts.

17:51.289 --> 17:53.163
They're hermetically scanned.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.658
Nice to meet you.

17:57.086 --> 17:58.284
Hi, kids!

18:06.596 --> 18:08.553
- You want a drink, Al?
- Sure.

18:08.764 --> 18:11.119
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

18:16.147 --> 18:18.074
- It's a real glider.
- Yeah.

18:18.858 --> 18:21.100
Thank you, this is... this is beautiful.

18:27.241 --> 18:28.353
And who is this?

18:29.285 --> 18:32.330
This is Steve, a new lawyer I'm working with.

18:32.413 --> 18:34.119
Scanning contract genius.

18:34.202 --> 18:37.767
This is one hell of a warehouse
you guys have here.

18:38.044 --> 18:39.705
Oh no, it's not a warehouse.

18:39.921 --> 18:42.424
It's an old hangar for the DC-9s.

18:42.508 --> 18:44.130
It was built in like 1973.

18:44.213 --> 18:47.780
Wow! I mean, you could NEVER get
a 17 GPC permit

18:47.863 --> 18:50.761
to do a residential conversion like this
these days, that's for sure.

18:51.766 --> 18:53.676
Scanning genius, eh?

18:54.227 --> 18:56.729
Well, I've happen to have seen
on the entertainment channel that

18:56.813 --> 19:01.180
studios are starting to sample actors
into these tiny little computer creatures.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.070
I mean, it must change the way
contracting works, completely.

19:04.153 --> 19:06.237
It's absolutely true, uh...

19:06.320 --> 19:08.340
- Sarah.
- Yes, that's absolutely true, Sarah,

19:08.423 --> 19:10.925
is a completely different type of contracts,
it's a one-off sale.

19:11.369 --> 19:13.973
Very tricky, lots of details and you have to be sharp.

19:14.163 --> 19:16.349
- 'Cause it's not going back to fix it afterwards.
- Uh-huh.

19:16.874 --> 19:18.548
What do you mean by "one-off sale"?

19:19.126 --> 19:21.962
Once they sample you, and you're in the computer
there is no way back.

19:22.171 --> 19:24.662
So whatever was agreed before
the sampling... that's the way it is.

19:24.882 --> 19:26.676
So you have to be really careful.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.508
The studio owns the character.

19:28.845 --> 19:31.135
- W-What character?
- One that used to be the actor.

19:31.305 --> 19:32.110
"Used to be"?

19:32.194 --> 19:35.886
The minute the studio pays and scans,
the actor isn't an actor,

19:36.102 --> 19:38.177
He's just a person, a nobody.

19:38.771 --> 19:41.660
The actor he once was
is now on a character

19:41.744 --> 19:42.866
in the studio's computer.

19:42.914 --> 19:44.058
The studio can do whatever they want.

19:44.277 --> 19:47.195
Unless the lawyer puts a clause in,
saying that they can't some.

19:47.405 --> 19:49.050
It's very tricky.

19:49.245 --> 19:50.240
Very tricky.

19:50.962 --> 19:53.137
It's a new field. We're on the cusp.

19:53.911 --> 19:56.284
- So what happens to the actor?
- What actor?

19:57.043 --> 20:00.207
The one that used to be the actor
is now this... computer creature.

20:01.210 --> 20:03.701
He goes off to play golf somewhere.

20:04.213 --> 20:05.560
And what if he doesn't like golf?

20:07.608 --> 20:10.380
Well then he plays... with whatever.

20:10.782 --> 20:12.470
Do you have a screen in this house?

20:12.680 --> 20:14.839
Or is that too progressive for you, guys?

20:19.228 --> 20:21.898
You know what, there's something else
I haven't told you.

20:23.119 --> 20:26.184
- Oh yeah? What is it? What haven't you told me?
- Yeah.

20:26.474 --> 20:29.237
They will be in 15 minutes, so, get it out. What?

20:31.918 --> 20:33.159
Oh my God...

20:34.327 --> 20:35.899
You were with Maria, too.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.655
Oh, say it, you piece of shit.

20:38.943 --> 20:40.085
Say you were with her, too.

20:40.583 --> 20:42.244
I knew that, honey,
I knew it the whole time.

20:42.327 --> 20:44.085
Where that little slut seduces you out...

20:45.600 --> 20:48.868
Oh my God, Max... Max! It makes me wanna vomit.

20:48.952 --> 20:51.790
- No, I wasn't with Maria.
- Oh, no? NO?!

20:51.969 --> 20:54.013
- Well, then who?
- I wasn't with anybody.

20:54.096 --> 20:55.212
But...

20:58.068 --> 20:59.511
I voted for Bush.

21:08.903 --> 21:10.313
You voted for Bush?

21:10.530 --> 21:13.519
I voted for Bush. You know what,
I voted for both Bushes,

21:13.602 --> 21:15.189
senior and junior,

21:15.608 --> 21:16.796
four times!

21:22.166 --> 21:23.080
Who are you?

21:24.674 --> 21:27.402
Oh my God, who did I marry? Sweetie-sweetie...

21:32.135 --> 21:33.842
That isn't Michelle.

21:34.137 --> 21:35.632
That is Michelle!

21:36.266 --> 21:38.470
No, I mean, obviously it's Michelle, but...

21:39.016 --> 21:41.472
you telling me she wasn't there
when they did this?

21:41.555 --> 21:46.402
You really want to know? She was in Paris when
they were making that crap on their computers.

21:48.526 --> 21:49.678
I'm shocked.

21:50.361 --> 21:51.987
I mean, it's... perfect.

21:52.177 --> 21:53.406
Perfect? No.

21:53.489 --> 21:56.071
But it's not bad at all for the beginning
of the revolution.

21:58.173 --> 21:59.150
Notice anything?

21:59.569 --> 22:00.663
Look at that morons!

22:00.746 --> 22:03.490
They've been trying to solve that bug for 3 years.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.456
I don't find that funny at all.

22:05.540 --> 22:08.915
Well, OK. Just wait till you see that wink
in the sex scenes. It will crack you up.

22:09.130 --> 22:10.162
That's hilarious!

22:10.322 --> 22:11.627
Yo, Mom!

22:11.841 --> 22:13.833
You got to admit it's good stuff!

22:14.051 --> 22:15.297
Don't be so harsh,

22:15.381 --> 22:17.807
technophobia never got human nature anywhere.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.514
So, you're with them now, huh?

22:20.598 --> 22:21.863
Hmm, you switched sides?

22:22.029 --> 22:24.344
Oh, come on, Robin, drop that 'pocrisy.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.646
It's not like anything has changed.

22:26.856 --> 22:28.036
They came, they took,

22:28.340 --> 22:30.441
they created a crappy romcom,

22:30.651 --> 22:33.060
just like they've been doing since the 40s.

22:33.404 --> 22:35.777
You think it'd be any better for her, or for you?

22:36.190 --> 22:38.196
She was stuck on the set for six weeks?

22:38.409 --> 22:39.376
Like a dog?

22:40.328 --> 22:43.168
- Kissing some actor with bad breath?
- Oh, let me see...

22:43.414 --> 22:46.285
You don't have the problem with the fact
that they didn't ask her?

22:47.460 --> 22:49.493
When did they ever ask you?

22:50.630 --> 22:52.488
You've always been their puppet.

22:53.382 --> 22:55.340
All of them... the producers, the directors,

22:55.423 --> 22:56.732
they told you what to do,

22:56.815 --> 22:58.846
they told you how to behave, how to act,

22:58.930 --> 23:01.065
how to smile, how to love.

23:02.266 --> 23:03.682
And they gave you the subtext

23:03.766 --> 23:07.306
for every... fucking... crappy line they churned out.

23:07.814 --> 23:09.439
And when you hit 35,

23:09.649 --> 23:10.895
they told you how to look young.

23:10.978 --> 23:13.101
Because if you didn't do
what they wanted you to do,

23:13.402 --> 23:16.321
shave off a couple of years for that
beautiful face of yours,

23:16.404 --> 23:19.319
you would... cease to exist, for Christ's sake!

23:19.784 --> 23:22.260
So... what's... the difference?

23:22.704 --> 23:24.247
The fucking choice?

23:24.330 --> 23:27.533
Yes, the fucking choice!
Al, what are you talking about?

23:28.251 --> 23:31.087
It is the gift of choice
that is being taken away!

23:31.170 --> 23:32.831
I don't want somebody else deciding

23:33.047 --> 23:34.874
when I can be, what I want to be,

23:35.091 --> 23:37.499
I want to decide! That's MY choice!

23:37.844 --> 23:39.679
To decide if I want to be a hooker,

23:39.762 --> 23:42.716
if I want to be an opera singer,
if I want to play Keith Richards.

23:43.182 --> 23:45.757
That's my choice... not theirs.

23:45.977 --> 23:47.139
You delusional!

23:47.322 --> 23:50.058
What kind of choice was it, when they
stressed you out?

23:50.273 --> 23:51.979
Saying that if you didn't work for a year,

23:52.062 --> 23:54.774
you would cease to exist? That's a choice?

23:55.361 --> 23:56.323
All the women

23:56.654 --> 23:58.066
who were face-lifted to death,

23:58.281 --> 23:59.609
they can't smile

23:59.824 --> 24:01.948
or show pain or emotion,

24:02.160 --> 24:03.275
that's a choice?

24:04.412 --> 24:07.035
That's just staying on as their tools, don't you get it?

24:08.249 --> 24:11.120
We've been saved, by some miracle,

24:11.431 --> 24:13.790
through these fucking computer samples!

24:14.297 --> 24:15.693
We've been SAVED!

24:16.424 --> 24:20.511
You're nuts if you don't take that deal!
I swear to you, you're a basket case

24:20.595 --> 24:22.635
and everything they say about you is true!

24:22.847 --> 24:26.374
About your terrible fucking choices! Wake up, Robin!

24:27.185 --> 24:29.059
This is your key to freedom.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.216
How is it going, my friend?

25:05.640 --> 25:07.514
Everything seems good, Dr. Barker.

25:08.184 --> 25:09.568
Any new sky monsters?

25:09.881 --> 25:12.988
Um, yeah, I... look, I have a real thing now...
the original Wright brothers.

25:13.013 --> 25:14.048
Oh wow.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.388
- Look at that. This is the glider? Wow.
- Uh-huh.

25:16.943 --> 25:19.819
That's December 17, 1903?

25:20.988 --> 25:24.156
I-I built a replica. It's exactly like that, but...

25:24.575 --> 25:27.745
15 feet wide. Yeah. She's about to make her debut.

25:27.829 --> 25:28.695
Very good.

25:28.778 --> 25:30.289
You know, when I think about it, you must be

25:30.373 --> 25:32.458
- part of the Wright brothers. The third one.
- Yeah.

25:32.542 --> 25:33.748
- Aaron Wright.
- Yeah.

25:34.001 --> 25:35.711
I am the original Wright brother.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.456
I build better than them, cause, you know...

25:37.539 --> 25:39.048
I build in a world of, um,

25:39.131 --> 25:40.923
jet planes and spaceships.

25:41.134 --> 25:42.120
It's totally different.

25:42.614 --> 25:45.554
- And, you know... don't forget they had no competition.
- Yeah.

25:58.943 --> 25:59.777
Siren.

26:01.362 --> 26:02.560
Silent.

26:04.073 --> 26:05.236
Glam.

26:06.742 --> 26:07.739
Love.

26:09.245 --> 26:10.408
Kite.

26:11.122 --> 26:12.154
Kite.

26:14.458 --> 26:15.574
Hear.

26:16.919 --> 26:18.035
Ear.

26:19.088 --> 26:20.167
Car.

26:21.424 --> 26:22.622
Far.

26:23.926 --> 26:25.124
Remember, Aaron,

26:25.428 --> 26:26.970
Just repeat the words.

26:31.517 --> 26:32.929
Table.

26:33.352 --> 26:34.385
Able.

26:35.062 --> 26:36.178
Sky.

26:36.981 --> 26:37.788
Sky.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.516
Parade.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.523
Afraid.

26:43.821 --> 26:44.984
Shell.

26:46.157 --> 26:47.236
Fell.

26:50.244 --> 26:52.534
Would that be a sign of decline?

26:53.039 --> 26:54.866
Well, it's too early to say, but, ah...

26:55.082 --> 26:59.080
it looks as if he is is deteriorating steadily
in terms of his hearing loss, yes.

27:01.088 --> 27:01.836
Train.

27:03.049 --> 27:03.962
Pain.

27:04.175 --> 27:05.337
Crown.

27:06.010 --> 27:07.126
Alone.

27:07.428 --> 27:08.674
Storm.

27:09.514 --> 27:10.546
Worm.

27:14.393 --> 27:15.757
And in terms of the...

27:15.841 --> 27:17.681
ophthalmologist report, um...

27:18.064 --> 27:20.310
oh, that is not terribly promising either.

27:21.234 --> 27:24.982
It has definitely moved into the regnitis pigmentosa stage.

27:25.822 --> 27:28.620
Is that, um... a long...

27:29.242 --> 27:31.615
drawn out way of saying something horrific?

27:31.911 --> 27:34.865
No, that is a very long expression to say that...

27:35.081 --> 27:36.991
his visual fields are constricting.

27:37.291 --> 27:41.420
Eventually, his night sight abilities
will decline dramatically,

27:41.504 --> 27:45.030
and... there will be... total night blindness.

27:45.675 --> 27:46.541
And then what?

27:48.146 --> 27:49.418
Dr. Barker?

27:49.637 --> 27:50.753
Yes, sir?

27:51.139 --> 27:54.507
Could we please play the, um... volcano track again?

27:55.434 --> 27:56.624
Volcano track?

27:58.187 --> 27:58.855
Thank you.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.017
Yes, sure.

28:09.907 --> 28:12.280
And the other 50%?

28:12.660 --> 28:15.033
Is Aaron at 50%?

28:17.373 --> 28:20.472
- That is the mystery with this syndrome.
- Right.

28:21.961 --> 28:25.330
You will never know until he is 30 or 35...

28:26.007 --> 28:27.916
if he will be completely blind.

28:31.095 --> 28:33.171
Aaron has a BEAUTIFUL mind.

28:33.723 --> 28:36.230
He is taking the information in...

28:36.684 --> 28:39.114
and translating in his ability, it is a gift.

28:39.197 --> 28:41.001
He hears "Throne" says "Alone",

28:41.084 --> 28:43.729
but he is perfectly aware of what he is doing.

28:44.775 --> 28:47.580
He'll imagine what movies will be like
in 50 years.

28:49.155 --> 28:52.954
I think that is s-s-somewhat similar
to what Aaron is doing...

28:53.117 --> 28:54.481
- In what way?
- In the way that...

28:55.495 --> 28:58.372
Well, the movie guys will just have the electronic stimuli

28:58.456 --> 29:02.491
that our brains translate according
to what is in our subconscious.

29:03.419 --> 29:05.828
See, people will be given story data,

29:06.047 --> 29:08.752
and they'll cast their mother or their girlfriend

29:08.966 --> 29:10.885
as Marlene Dietrich or you...

29:11.344 --> 29:14.926
All depending on what is in their particular... box.

29:15.139 --> 29:17.630
This is exactly what Aaron is doing now.

29:20.686 --> 29:22.287
He is a rare case,

29:22.605 --> 29:24.396
and he is ahead of his time by...

29:24.607 --> 29:27.478
God knows how many decades.

29:30.404 --> 29:33.026
What about you, my friend, how are you?

29:33.699 --> 29:34.613
Okay.

29:35.785 --> 29:38.027
Any new parts on the horizon?

29:43.292 --> 29:44.455
I think so.

29:56.931 --> 29:59.504
Whatever happens, let Steve do all the talking.

30:02.895 --> 30:04.806
Robin Wright for Jeff Green.

30:05.022 --> 30:07.893
Miss Wright, I didn't recognize you.

30:08.943 --> 30:10.402
What else is new?

30:41.809 --> 30:43.138
You okay?

30:53.404 --> 30:54.946
"No child abuse,

30:55.156 --> 30:58.992
no sex, only love story,
betrayal, romantic comedy...

30:59.285 --> 31:00.697
no retard...

31:00.912 --> 31:02.288
truly handicapped...

31:02.497 --> 31:03.778
no porn?

31:04.248 --> 31:06.205
No Holocaust, no Nazis."

31:06.417 --> 31:07.777
You marked this up?

31:08.262 --> 31:09.290
You better believe it.

31:09.504 --> 31:11.527
What are you, some sort of
swastika freak or something?

31:11.611 --> 31:14.087
- No, it's not him, it's my kids.
- It's her kids.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.246
Your kids is Nazis and porn?

31:18.262 --> 31:20.227
Porn? At your age?

31:24.227 --> 31:26.718
Nazis and Holocaust bring in awards.

31:26.938 --> 31:28.812
Awards for whom? For your computer artists?

31:29.023 --> 31:31.967
Nice, yes, you're computer artists now,
not just technicians.

31:34.195 --> 31:37.482
Look, this is just all... details,
it's tributes, minutia.

31:37.698 --> 31:40.950
I'll agree to everything except
this, um... Sci-Fi bullshit.

31:41.244 --> 31:42.905
No Sci-Fi, Jack.

31:43.454 --> 31:45.872
Sci-Fi is a dumb genre, in our opinion.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.418
She's never done Sci-Fi before,
and she's not going to do it now.

31:49.502 --> 31:53.414
Well, if she had done one Sci-Fi, this contract
would be worth 6 times as much!

31:54.090 --> 31:56.214
No Sci-Fi, no contract.

31:56.496 --> 31:57.510
Then, no contract.

31:58.678 --> 32:01.715
Why? Why, Sci-Fi is fantasy.

32:02.974 --> 32:05.308
You know how many people
read "Lord of Rings"?

32:06.269 --> 32:08.896
1 thousandth, of a single per cent

32:08.980 --> 32:10.731
of the people that went to see the movie,

32:10.815 --> 32:13.224
read the book. And you want to know why?

32:13.542 --> 32:16.445
Because it is one hell of a complicated read,
that's why.

32:16.529 --> 32:19.282
It's a nightmare to get through! It's... It's boring!

32:19.699 --> 32:21.377
Did you read it before you made the movie?

32:22.118 --> 32:23.613
Are you kidding?

32:24.203 --> 32:25.532
But I saw the movie,

32:25.910 --> 32:27.621
and that's why we make movies.

32:29.834 --> 32:32.503
- But that's not what I want to say.
- What do you want to say, Jeff?

32:34.005 --> 32:35.996
That I want to make you young forever.

32:37.508 --> 32:38.967
That's what we gonna do.

32:41.971 --> 32:43.252
How old are you?

32:43.473 --> 32:45.928
45? 48? 50?

32:46.976 --> 32:48.055
44.

32:48.936 --> 32:52.021
Sign the Sci-Fi and I guarantee

32:52.301 --> 32:55.608
that I'll make you 33... 34,

32:56.402 --> 32:58.395
For ever young, I promise you.

32:59.363 --> 33:00.740
For ever young.

33:01.204 --> 33:02.356
33-34?

33:02.575 --> 33:04.283
- Which sounds better?
- 32.

33:04.494 --> 33:06.700
Greedy. That's greedy.

33:07.163 --> 33:09.737
34 and we'll seal the deal.

33:09.957 --> 33:10.657
For life.

33:10.838 --> 33:12.377
You know, in some countries, life...

33:12.461 --> 33:14.202
sentence means 20 years.

33:14.504 --> 33:15.203
In what countries?

33:15.588 --> 33:16.883
- Middle East.
- Middle East?

33:17.687 --> 33:20.572
They're fucking animals over there!
20 years for murder?

33:21.032 --> 33:21.843
20 years?

33:22.929 --> 33:24.257
In 20 years...

33:24.472 --> 33:27.509
this technology will be as old
as the invention of the boomerang.

33:29.227 --> 33:31.137
- 20 years.
- Okay, great.

33:35.964 --> 33:37.691
- Can we do it now?
- What?

33:38.140 --> 33:41.571
This thing that you need to do to me,
can we do it right this second?

33:41.763 --> 33:43.442
I... because I don't want to wait another day,

33:43.525 --> 33:45.402
I want to do it now or never.

33:57.088 --> 33:58.369
Robin Wright.

34:00.341 --> 34:02.291
- Aren't you, um...?
- Yes, it's me.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.167
- Chris... Christopher Ryne.
- Yes.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.668
What are you doing here?

34:06.144 --> 34:07.029
I'm the scanner.

34:08.558 --> 34:10.100
Come on, don't feel sorry.

34:10.518 --> 34:12.661
The others guys are at home, doing nothing.

34:14.065 --> 34:17.811
You were such a great cinematographer,
for so many great movies.

34:17.893 --> 34:18.536
Thank you.

34:18.886 --> 34:22.437
You know what... at least I get to work
with the actors, and... light.

34:22.799 --> 34:26.067
I'm lucky... to be able to meet you at work.

34:26.909 --> 34:28.099
Just like the old times.

34:29.038 --> 34:29.850
And,

34:30.817 --> 34:32.782
I also like that I get to tell you to...

34:32.998 --> 34:34.567
take off your beautiful dress.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.677
A changing room down the hall
to your right.

34:42.213 --> 34:43.670
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

35:11.213 --> 35:11.904
Chris?

35:15.267 --> 35:16.161
Hello?

35:16.584 --> 35:17.368
Anybody here?

35:17.654 --> 35:18.547
Yeah, I got you, Rob.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.671
Just make yourself comfortable,
we'll start in a minute, OK?

35:33.392 --> 35:34.887
I don't want to miss any of your...

35:35.394 --> 35:37.269
charming expressions here...

35:38.439 --> 35:39.412
Princess.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.602
Now, smile.

35:48.533 --> 35:49.648
Wider.

35:51.134 --> 35:52.119
You're happy.

35:54.831 --> 35:55.530
Happy.

36:01.087 --> 36:02.415
Now, laugh.

36:05.091 --> 36:06.337
Big laugh.

36:08.594 --> 36:09.627
Gimme here your laugh.

36:17.603 --> 36:18.762
Come on, give me a big laugh.

36:25.111 --> 36:26.772
BIG laugh, yeah!

36:31.625 --> 36:33.118
Now, the laughter...

36:34.620 --> 36:35.949
slowly

36:37.540 --> 36:38.916
slowly...

36:40.543 --> 36:41.824
turns...

36:44.547 --> 36:45.663
to emptiness.

36:51.319 --> 36:52.757
Blankness...

36:56.434 --> 36:58.011
to sadness.

36:59.854 --> 37:02.144
I can't, stop... stop.

37:03.816 --> 37:05.442
Stop! Turn off the lights.

37:17.538 --> 37:18.756
Chris, I got it.

37:19.610 --> 37:21.001
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.

37:26.543 --> 37:29.842
Robin, did I ever tell you
how I got into this business?

37:30.384 --> 37:31.880
The agenting business?

37:32.094 --> 37:33.519
I mean, the REAL story?

37:36.432 --> 37:39.572
Of course, I never told you,
I was probably too embarrassed.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.009
Can you believe, I've been in this business
since I was...

37:43.230 --> 37:44.809
10 years old.

37:45.191 --> 37:46.603
A 5th-grader.

37:47.109 --> 37:48.997
An agent in the 5th grade.

37:50.613 --> 37:51.361
Let me explain.

37:51.444 --> 37:54.610
We had this guy in our neighbourhood,
in Bronx.

37:54.909 --> 37:57.282
Joey Fairy-Tail, they called him.

37:57.912 --> 37:59.078
He was this, um...

37:59.739 --> 38:00.661
you know...

38:01.013 --> 38:02.328
How should I put it...

38:02.708 --> 38:04.045
He was born with a tail.

38:07.088 --> 38:08.494
A REAL tail.

38:09.173 --> 38:10.715
We're talkin', um... an inch.

38:10.969 --> 38:12.545
Maybe... maybe 2 inches.

38:13.177 --> 38:14.399
Like a boxer dog.

38:15.468 --> 38:18.844
And... from the minute this came out, in gym class,

38:19.058 --> 38:22.605
he suffered the most horrible abuse.

38:23.396 --> 38:27.396
I can't describe to you what this kid
went through, an 8 year old boy.

38:30.111 --> 38:31.601
They would strip him down in the street

38:31.868 --> 38:34.320
sing songs to his tail.

38:34.532 --> 38:36.659
Kids would stay outside his window at night and yell:

38:36.742 --> 38:39.328
"Hey Joey! Gimme a ride on your tail,

38:39.748 --> 38:41.452
"I want to stir my chocolate milk!"

38:44.167 --> 38:45.993
So... one day

38:46.397 --> 38:48.418
I go up to him, before school,

38:48.629 --> 38:49.792
I had this idea.

38:50.528 --> 38:52.942
I say: "Listen, Joey."

38:53.468 --> 38:54.844
"From now on,

38:55.303 --> 38:58.665
anyone who wants to go on your tail, that's a buck".

38:59.932 --> 39:01.759
And he looks at me and goes:

39:02.310 --> 39:03.185
"Really, Al?"

39:04.061 --> 39:05.936
And what am I supposed to say to them?

39:06.230 --> 39:07.607
Tell them: "Al said so?"

39:09.358 --> 39:12.277
I was a... scrawny kid,

39:12.653 --> 39:14.231
hunched over...

39:14.739 --> 39:16.067
a reject.

39:17.066 --> 39:19.093
Not exactly the rugs-wrestler type.

39:19.952 --> 39:22.787
So that night, I went to the Twin Towers.

39:23.289 --> 39:25.365
I mean the Bronx Twin Towers:

39:25.534 --> 39:27.291
a Podlowsky brothers.

39:27.502 --> 39:30.788
Remember Podlowsky? Started shaving at 10.

39:31.756 --> 39:35.210
And at 13, they went dating
40-year old divorcees.

39:35.843 --> 39:38.418
So I tell them about Joey Fairy-Tail,

39:38.638 --> 39:41.431
and I offer them 50 cents for every kid

39:41.641 --> 39:43.598
who wants to see his tail.

39:44.101 --> 39:46.676
They take the tailships and manage the line,

39:46.896 --> 39:48.966
and I do the booking and collect the fees!

39:50.399 --> 39:52.829
That month, I made more dough

39:52.912 --> 39:55.520
than my old man made as a shoemaker all year,

39:55.738 --> 39:57.280
and I was 10 years old!

39:58.465 --> 40:00.261
And from then on, the business took off.

40:00.827 --> 40:04.991
By age 13, I was agenting for all the losers.

40:05.498 --> 40:09.327
The cripples, the midgets and
the fire-eating hunchbacks of the Bronx.

40:09.836 --> 40:12.893
Within two years, we were the
richest family on the block.

40:17.426 --> 40:18.126
But...

40:18.636 --> 40:20.199
When I was 15...

40:21.056 --> 40:22.005
ahem...

40:23.099 --> 40:24.910
the child protection got on my case

40:24.993 --> 40:27.801
for abusing handicapped kids,

40:28.276 --> 40:30.429
and I did three-months time.

40:33.401 --> 40:34.314
And then,

40:34.563 --> 40:36.710
after many years I wound up in this town.

40:37.463 --> 40:39.130
It's all glitz and glitter,

40:40.032 --> 40:41.743
and I was ashamed of my past.

40:44.662 --> 40:46.323
But deep inside,

40:47.165 --> 40:50.657
I knew I had an advantage
over all the others:

40:51.711 --> 40:54.428
the power to recognize a flaw,

40:55.381 --> 40:56.460
a weakness,

40:57.508 --> 40:58.671
a defect,

40:58.833 --> 40:59.969
and to exploit it

41:00.052 --> 41:01.490
for my needs as an agent.

41:02.846 --> 41:03.758
And...

41:06.100 --> 41:07.465
And that's how I met you.

41:09.937 --> 41:11.511
You were perfect for me.

41:13.107 --> 41:15.064
As lovely as an angel,

41:15.443 --> 41:18.612
and with the worst defect an actress can have.

41:21.078 --> 41:22.069
Fear.

41:24.827 --> 41:26.488
Such fear!

41:29.582 --> 41:30.994
Real terror.

41:32.251 --> 41:35.832
A terror that stand in the way of every desire.

41:38.799 --> 41:41.794
Panic attacks before every critical meeting.

41:44.305 --> 41:45.468
Paralysis

41:46.224 --> 41:48.893
at face with truly grip roles.

41:51.854 --> 41:53.811
And I was there to help you.

41:55.066 --> 41:59.320
I was the inner demon that lived off your fears
and made a living

41:59.529 --> 42:01.320
off your weakness.

42:08.279 --> 42:09.787
But then the kids came along,

42:09.997 --> 42:12.488
and all of a sudden you stopped being scared.

42:13.751 --> 42:15.875
You've never been so happy,

42:16.838 --> 42:19.163
You just didn't want to work anymore,

42:19.382 --> 42:21.043
you wanted to be with them.

42:23.845 --> 42:26.300
I never felt so abandoned.

42:28.516 --> 42:30.391
That's when I realized...

42:31.269 --> 42:33.742
I'm not your agent, I just love you.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.605
I was afraid you were going to leave me.

42:48.661 --> 42:51.072
Then all of a sudden, in the space of a few weeks,

42:51.155 --> 42:54.533
Aaron's condition started going... downhill.

42:56.210 --> 42:59.248
And my strength was rebuilt from your weakness.

43:03.676 --> 43:06.511
Then Aaron goes further and further away...

43:07.930 --> 43:09.757
and we were left alone.

43:15.563 --> 43:17.303
And now, you really can't leave...

43:20.860 --> 43:22.603
trapped inside that monster.

43:29.035 --> 43:31.159
This is your last performance.

43:34.540 --> 43:36.913
And I guess it should bigger save you,

43:38.559 --> 43:40.086
all your fears,

43:41.255 --> 43:42.963
all your demons.

43:44.842 --> 43:46.717
You didn't deserve that.

43:49.514 --> 43:51.139
You don't deserve it.

44:19.585 --> 44:23.583
20 YEARS LATER

46:00.478 --> 46:02.166
Welcome to Abrahama, Ms. Wright.

46:03.064 --> 46:04.262
Is this your first time with us?

46:05.983 --> 46:07.442
It certainly is.

46:08.736 --> 46:11.019
I see you're expected at the Miramount Abrahama hotel,

46:11.102 --> 46:13.689
as a distinguished guest of the Futurist Congress.

46:20.665 --> 46:22.712
That's a pretty good-looking car for it's age.

46:23.584 --> 46:24.451
What year is it?

46:25.013 --> 46:26.229
2013.

46:31.759 --> 46:33.551
Just a reminder, Miss Wright.

46:37.765 --> 46:41.258
Abrahama City is a restricted animated zone.

46:42.854 --> 46:45.393
The only way to leave the animation zone

46:45.773 --> 46:47.351
is when we meet again,

46:48.276 --> 46:49.734
on your way out.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.030
Your ampule.

48:39.512 --> 48:42.086
In the age of the spiritual machines

48:42.283 --> 48:44.764
where the streets have no names.

48:47.218 --> 48:50.644
The Earth is covered with rage and shame.

48:52.668 --> 48:55.232
Agent Robin is back again!

49:10.209 --> 49:11.586
"Triple R."

49:12.044 --> 49:15.129
"Rebel Robot Robin: Street Fighter."

49:15.464 --> 49:17.258
Now... in the air!

50:00.272 --> 50:02.176
Good afternoon, Miss Wright.

50:02.386 --> 50:05.340
Welcome to Miramount Hotel Abrahama.

50:44.470 --> 50:46.131
The city of Abrahama

50:46.215 --> 50:47.792
and Miramount Nagasaki

50:47.876 --> 50:50.408
welcome you to the Futurist Congress.

50:50.789 --> 50:53.053
We would like to remind you that Abrahama

50:53.271 --> 50:56.557
is a fully restricted animated zone.

51:06.492 --> 51:08.652
Agent Robin is back again!

51:12.331 --> 51:13.280
"Triple R."

51:15.459 --> 51:18.212
"Rebel Robot Robin: Street Fighter".

51:18.921 --> 51:20.955
Now in the air!

51:35.146 --> 51:36.474
Hi, Aaron.

51:37.815 --> 51:39.600
So I see you've left your room.

51:40.526 --> 51:41.642
You feeling better?

51:41.861 --> 51:44.103
No, it means it's stopped raining,

51:44.322 --> 51:47.324
so I can walk without being afraid
of slipping on wet leaves.

51:48.493 --> 51:50.208
So, how does it look?

51:50.291 --> 51:53.628
Oh my God, I wish you could see me animated,
it's pretty sick.

51:54.790 --> 51:58.412
It's like a genius designer on a bad asset trip.

51:58.628 --> 52:01.391
- How do you mean?
- Oh my God, I don't know. I look like...

52:02.465 --> 52:05.092
a combination between Cinderella on heroin

52:05.176 --> 52:07.887
and an Egyptian Queen on a bad hair day.

52:07.970 --> 52:08.884
Mom?

52:10.431 --> 52:11.713
Did they recognize you, Mom?

52:11.933 --> 52:14.554
I mean, the new film is out all over the year.

52:15.921 --> 52:17.895
No, nobody sees me.

52:21.275 --> 52:23.232
I'm just an old lady to them.

52:24.570 --> 52:26.611
Probably 'cause you're animated.

52:26.906 --> 52:30.032
No, you never... recognize me anywhere.

52:31.369 --> 52:32.781
Welcome to the Wright.

52:32.995 --> 52:35.369
No one's recognized me for 30 years.

53:00.124 --> 53:02.970
Aaron, you know, I can barely hear you in this crowd.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.361
I gonna go to my room for a while.

53:05.444 --> 53:07.485
Check-in later, OK? I love you.

53:10.449 --> 53:14.116
Robin Wright, um... personal guest
to the Miramount Classic.

53:14.328 --> 53:17.662
Wright, Robin. You are the sixth one today.

53:18.875 --> 53:20.037
The sixth what?

53:20.251 --> 53:22.208
The sixth Robin Wright.

53:22.545 --> 53:25.417
I guess they didn't look as "Robin-ish" as you do.

53:26.155 --> 53:30.002
Anyway, Ralph will see you to your room,
Miss Wright.

53:30.219 --> 53:32.343
Have a pleasant Congress.

54:43.668 --> 54:45.957
The Animated Zone...

54:52.760 --> 54:53.845
Miss Wright

54:53.928 --> 54:55.969
think that your new film, "Street Fighter",

54:56.180 --> 54:58.007
reflects our lives in any way?

54:59.267 --> 55:00.595
Yeah, I do, I mean...

55:00.678 --> 55:02.895
You know, I find something new in this

55:02.979 --> 55:05.106
character Agent Robin every time I do it

55:05.189 --> 55:07.967
like now, in The Street Fighter's production,
you know the...

55:08.860 --> 55:10.604
the robots that come from the gutters,

55:10.687 --> 55:12.238
they're so much a part of our lives,

55:12.321 --> 55:14.113
they're... they're close to us.

55:14.782 --> 55:19.027
Because people buy household robots and they...

55:19.704 --> 55:21.753
basically just suck,

55:22.491 --> 55:26.669
blood out of them, and then they just
use them up, and... and they expire, and...

55:26.752 --> 55:29.172
the poor robots, you know, they used to have

55:29.255 --> 55:31.551
Rehab centers for them, and now they just...

55:33.342 --> 55:36.468
they use them as scrap, it's so sad, and...

55:36.856 --> 55:41.631
I don't know, people call "Triple R" Sci-Fi,
but I-I just say...

55:42.727 --> 55:44.114
it's documentary.

55:50.818 --> 55:52.100
Room Service?

55:52.778 --> 55:54.689
Hello? Can I have room service?

55:54.906 --> 55:57.908
Yes, Miss Wright. How can I help you?

55:58.304 --> 56:01.703
I... the, um... the light went off here,
the power, everything's off.

56:03.039 --> 56:06.498
Does that make sense, or...
or is this just in my mind?

56:06.709 --> 56:09.165
Ultimately everything makes sense,

56:09.378 --> 56:11.476
and everything is in our mind.

56:12.006 --> 56:14.084
What would you like to order, Miss Wright?

56:14.926 --> 56:17.595
A want a full breakfast, just 3 eggs, um...

56:19.263 --> 56:21.553
and hash-browns and toast, please.

56:21.766 --> 56:23.343
And to drink, Miss Wright?

56:23.427 --> 56:24.675
No, I'll skip the liquids.

56:24.758 --> 56:25.724
All types of?

56:25.807 --> 56:27.694
Yes, all types. How long will that be?

56:27.874 --> 56:31.323
2 seconds. How would you like your eggs,
Miss Wright?

56:32.151 --> 56:33.100
Over easy, but...

56:33.319 --> 56:34.766
will the yolks be soft

56:34.850 --> 56:36.738
by the time they hit the 100th floor?

56:36.948 --> 56:38.692
But of course, Miss Wright.

56:38.908 --> 56:42.532
That's exactly why we at
Miramount Hotel Abrahama

56:42.616 --> 56:44.786
invented the supersonic elevator.

56:50.294 --> 56:53.297
Ralph, it's dark in here or is it
just in my mind?

56:53.381 --> 56:55.298
Everything is in our mind.

56:55.508 --> 56:59.091
If you see the dark, then you chose the dark.

57:54.567 --> 57:56.033
Oh my God, it's in the water!

57:57.403 --> 57:59.243
It's in the fucking tap water!

58:00.552 --> 58:01.842
Oh, my God.

58:10.458 --> 58:11.537
Jeff!

58:12.627 --> 58:14.786
Jeff Green, did you hear me?

58:16.255 --> 58:17.833
Can you fucking hear me?

58:21.079 --> 58:21.743
Stop!

58:22.433 --> 58:25.677
STOP! I'll sign! I'll sign.

58:28.059 --> 58:30.680
Just stop fucking with my head!

58:34.232 --> 58:35.774
Please, stop.

58:38.069 --> 58:39.528
I'll sign.

58:54.335 --> 58:57.042
If it be your will,

58:59.799 --> 59:02.552
that I speak no more,

59:05.304 --> 59:08.306
And my voice be still,

59:10.935 --> 59:14.019
As it was before

59:16.282 --> 59:19.311
I will speak no more,

59:20.603 --> 59:25.155
I shall no pipe, none tune.

59:27.593 --> 59:30.822
I am spoken for...

59:31.622 --> 59:34.244
If it be your will...

59:57.899 --> 59:58.951
Are you Robin Wright?

01:00:00.902 --> 01:00:03.326
Yes, at least I used to be.

01:00:03.779 --> 01:00:04.978
Miramount Police!

01:00:06.265 --> 01:00:09.536
You went too far. You know we’re busy
making you a star.

01:00:09.994 --> 01:00:12.663
Next time we'll shoot you. Fucking whore!

01:00:12.997 --> 01:00:14.799
Arrest her. NOW!

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:23.213
Miss Wright, Mr. Green is expecting you at his office.

01:00:59.393 --> 01:01:01.252
So you're here too, huh?

01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:03.754
You and I are the only ones who survived.

01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:07.127
And who are all the rest?

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.386
Characters they invented.

01:01:13.474 --> 01:01:15.052
What have you been doing all these years?

01:01:15.393 --> 01:01:16.472
I was with UNICEF,

01:01:16.686 --> 01:01:19.059
hanging out foods for the hungry kids of Africa.

01:01:19.272 --> 01:01:19.936
And you?

01:01:22.066 --> 01:01:23.717
Taking care of my son.

01:01:30.881 --> 01:01:36.873
Robin! Robin, Robin, Robin. Wow! Wow...

01:01:36.956 --> 01:01:39.577
You look fantastic! UN-animated, I mean.

01:01:40.626 --> 01:01:41.872
Look who's left.

01:01:42.253 --> 01:01:45.421
Just you and... what's his name,
sitting outside, um...?

01:01:45.798 --> 01:01:48.717
That guy's one thing, he cost me a fortune,
but you...

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.926
I paid 2 cents for your contract and
her you still are,

01:01:53.139 --> 01:01:54.681
20 years later.

01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:57.851
What you've been doing all these years?

01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:01.227
Feeding hungry children in Africa.

01:02:03.274 --> 01:02:06.563
- There still is hungry kids there, huh?
- Well, not so many, thanks to you.

01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:09.110
So... tell me about this congress, Jeff.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:11.647
Why is everyone so stressed out?

01:02:11.866 --> 01:02:14.535
- Oh well, you will see in a while.
- What will I see?

01:02:16.162 --> 01:02:17.237
You see, Robin,

01:02:17.914 --> 01:02:20.951
that pretty soon this whole structure
will stop existing.

01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:22.816
Structure? What do you mean, Jeff?

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.254
This, the Miramount Classic,
the Miramount Hotel?

01:02:25.338 --> 01:02:28.727
No, no, no. Not Miramount Hotel. I mean,
this whole structure won't exist.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.677
The script writer, who needs his antidepressants,

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:41.998
The ex-Russian story-board artist
with the drinking problem,

01:02:42.955 --> 01:02:45.314
Animators always behind deadline,

01:02:46.067 --> 01:02:49.693
And those idiots who fall in love
with their computer characters.

01:02:50.279 --> 01:02:53.655
Special effects people, they can all
go to FUCK themselves!

01:02:56.751 --> 01:02:59.865
Movies are old news, Robin.

01:03:00.498 --> 01:03:03.072
A remnant of the last millennium.

01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:07.535
As you will very soon find out upstairs,
in the Futurist Congress

01:03:07.755 --> 01:03:11.504
Miramount Nagasaki is entering a new age.

01:03:13.094 --> 01:03:16.137
We're in the era of free choice!

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:21.288
And what does that mean for
the extension of our contract?

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.688
The contract is no big deal,

01:03:23.771 --> 01:03:25.598
just a 20-year extension.

01:03:26.023 --> 01:03:27.964
And one other little clause.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.227
What's in this "other little clause", Jeff?

01:03:32.405 --> 01:03:33.894
That from now on...

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:35.908
they can drink you.

01:03:35.992 --> 01:03:37.949
Or you can be eaten, like an omelette or...

01:03:38.032 --> 01:03:39.323
or crème brûlée.

01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:41.399
You see, Robin... from now on, you're...

01:03:42.268 --> 01:03:44.744
a substance, that's all.

01:03:45.334 --> 01:03:46.944
You're a chemical formula...

01:03:47.587 --> 01:03:49.717
that Miramount-Nagasaki's

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.795
brilliant pharmaceutical department has cracked.

01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:56.553
And people can... can drink you, in their milkshake,

01:03:56.762 --> 01:03:59.551
and imagine you the way that they LIKE.

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:04.354
- Everything?
- Yes.

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:07.429
"Everything", means everything.

01:04:07.773 --> 01:04:10.443
Drama, Little Red Riding Hood,

01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:13.060
extreme art-house, porn,

01:04:13.279 --> 01:04:16.233
comedy, Sci-Fi, trash, zombies.

01:04:16.449 --> 01:04:18.276
WHAT do you care?

01:04:19.285 --> 01:04:20.761
Now tell me something, Robin:

01:04:20.953 --> 01:04:24.912
when you fantasies alone, in bed, in the dark

01:04:25.124 --> 01:04:27.497
do you pay him or her,

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:28.992
royalties?

01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:39.507
You'll sign anyway, Robin.

01:04:39.722 --> 01:04:41.098
Oh yeah? And why do you think so?

01:04:42.058 --> 01:04:44.846
Because you might have sold your image
as an actress,

01:04:45.645 --> 01:04:48.743
but the actress never left your soul.

01:04:50.597 --> 01:04:52.780
You drove all this way just to be on stage

01:04:52.863 --> 01:04:54.836
for a single moment of fame.

01:04:55.404 --> 01:04:57.448
To be seen, after all these years.

01:04:58.282 --> 01:05:01.575
And you will sign for the same reason.

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:32.747
Ladies

01:06:33.503 --> 01:06:34.879
and gentlemen.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.294
LOOK AT US!

01:06:42.845 --> 01:06:46.741
For God's sake, look at us!

01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:51.136
Can you believe that a tiny mini-ampule

01:06:51.219 --> 01:06:55.144
manufactured at the Miramount-Nagasaki labs

01:06:55.365 --> 01:06:57.060
made THIS...

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:59.682
Neo-God creation!

01:07:14.418 --> 01:07:15.961
I'd say

01:07:16.213 --> 01:07:17.369
if you hear,

01:07:18.214 --> 01:07:18.955
you're a believer.

01:07:31.853 --> 01:07:33.179
<i>My friends,</i>

01:07:33.563 --> 01:07:34.918
I came here

01:07:35.439 --> 01:07:36.686
to declare

01:07:37.441 --> 01:07:41.439
that our great, great scientists

01:07:41.772 --> 01:07:44.395
at the Miramount-Nagasaki labs

01:07:44.699 --> 01:07:46.490
have recently cracked

01:07:46.701 --> 01:07:50.283
the chemical formula of FREE CHOICE!

01:07:58.546 --> 01:08:01.583
I, Reeve Bobs,

01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:05.678
President of Miramount-Nagasaki, here declare

01:08:05.761 --> 01:08:07.138
that as of tomorrow

01:08:07.221 --> 01:08:09.720
that genius Free Choice formula

01:08:09.932 --> 01:08:11.956
be out in the market accessible

01:08:12.214 --> 01:08:13.824
for each and every human being!

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:22.520
Now just imagine

01:08:22.737 --> 01:08:25.359
a life with no frustration.

01:08:39.377 --> 01:08:41.004
No jealousy.

01:08:43.424 --> 01:08:44.706
No ego.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.095
You have a dream?!

01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:53.649
Be your dream, for God's sake!

01:09:03.402 --> 01:09:04.660
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:05.779 --> 01:09:08.484
It is a supreme honor for me

01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:10.943
to invite to this stage

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.037
the everlasting symbol

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.497
of the Miramount-Nagasaki revolution.

01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:18.997
She used to be our finest actress

01:09:19.335 --> 01:09:20.662
then she became

01:09:20.747 --> 01:09:23.631
the best ever DIGITAL actress

01:09:23.714 --> 01:09:25.277
Agent Robin!

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.256
And as of tomorrow

01:09:29.386 --> 01:09:31.426
you can be her!

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.340
Be her, be with her!

01:09:34.642 --> 01:09:36.069
ROBIN WRIGHT!

01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:54.573
Look at me.

01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.907
They call me the "symbol".

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.495
I used to be an actress.

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:04.661
Then I was a pile of computer codes.

01:10:05.395 --> 01:10:09.627
And now, as of tomorrow, you gonna be able
to drink me, you can become me,

01:10:10.052 --> 01:10:12.176
by drinking a milkshake.

01:10:13.347 --> 01:10:16.016
Wake up, people! Wake up!

01:10:16.639 --> 01:10:19.367
Behind every chemical compound you invent,

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:22.545
and use, there is a person built exactly like you.

01:10:22.732 --> 01:10:24.143
From the same material,

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:25.784
the same loves,

01:10:25.985 --> 01:10:27.480
the same dreams.

01:10:28.488 --> 01:10:29.734
Wake up!

01:10:31.945 --> 01:10:33.244
This is my son.

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:35.986
He can barely hear, he is deaf.

01:10:37.455 --> 01:10:40.290
And you could have been his hope, all of you.

01:10:41.009 --> 01:10:42.575
Did you ever think

01:10:42.658 --> 01:10:44.917
to direct your chemistry research

01:10:45.588 --> 01:10:46.644
to his problem?

01:10:47.256 --> 01:10:49.728
Or to hundreds of millions of other children?

01:10:51.442 --> 01:10:52.501
Did you, ever?

01:10:55.223 --> 01:10:57.285
I just want to remind you of one thing:

01:10:57.934 --> 01:10:59.345
that if you think,

01:11:00.027 --> 01:11:02.932
that by releasing your chemistry,

01:11:03.147 --> 01:11:04.226
to the world

01:11:04.565 --> 01:11:07.021
you'll dictate, how we desire,

01:11:07.447 --> 01:11:08.672
what we desire...

01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:12.569
I just want to tell you: by doing that,

01:11:12.907 --> 01:11:15.576
you will be releasing your conscience as well,

01:11:15.785 --> 01:11:18.324
and your conscience will devour you.

01:11:19.914 --> 01:11:21.546
And you'll die of guilt.

01:11:22.375 --> 01:11:24.202
You will die of guilt.

01:11:30.299 --> 01:11:31.497
Look at me!

01:11:32.552 --> 01:11:34.676
I am your prophet of doom!

01:11:45.949 --> 01:11:47.221
FRIENDS!

01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:49.525
You've gone too far!

01:11:50.012 --> 01:11:51.311
Don't you get it?

01:11:53.239 --> 01:11:54.372
Just imagine!

01:11:54.615 --> 01:11:57.535
Tomorrow when you leave Abrahama,

01:11:57.618 --> 01:11:59.445
you will never know that you left!

01:12:00.413 --> 01:12:01.279
Because

01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:03.787
from tomorrow on

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:06.759
Abrahama will no longer be

01:12:06.842 --> 01:12:08.934
a Looney Tunes playground!

01:12:09.772 --> 01:12:13.319
Abrahama is going to be our life!

01:13:02.308 --> 01:13:03.934
You should go back inside.

01:13:23.807 --> 01:13:24.461
Robin!

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:26.522
It is Robin, right?

01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:29.967
Let's go. Now!

01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:40.898
Breathe.

01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:51.438
Breath deeply, hold it as long as you can.

01:13:54.402 --> 01:13:55.517
Come on.

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:58.739
You need to get down below, I feel it coming.

01:13:58.823 --> 01:14:00.971
- Do you believe them?
- Of course I believe them!

01:14:01.495 --> 01:14:03.947
We already trapped in our animated characters.

01:14:29.041 --> 01:14:29.795
Sarah!

01:14:35.276 --> 01:14:37.387
- I think I saw Sarah.
- You probably did.

01:14:37.945 --> 01:14:40.313
It just like her to be one of the rebels,
you should be very proud.

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:43.515
How do you know who Sarah is? How do you know?!

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:46.199
I know a lot more than you can imagine, Robin.

01:15:02.936 --> 01:15:06.381
Okay, clear out! I got a badly injured woman here.

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.186
I said we have a woman with severe head injuries here,
what's wrong with you, people?

01:15:10.269 --> 01:15:12.061
She has irreversible hallucinogenic poisoning,

01:15:12.144 --> 01:15:13.249
now who is giving up their seat?

01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:16.064
I suggest we draw straws.

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:19.935
- Who are you?
- I'm from management.

01:15:23.241 --> 01:15:25.400
- What management?
- Hotel management.

01:15:25.618 --> 01:15:27.379
Everyone here is a hotel management

01:15:27.995 --> 01:15:29.600
it's powerful important people.

01:15:36.712 --> 01:15:37.413
Sit.

01:15:40.633 --> 01:15:41.712
Stay with me.

01:15:42.969 --> 01:15:45.460
Robin, you must just stay with me,
this is very important.

01:15:46.097 --> 01:15:47.046
Listen to me.

01:15:47.598 --> 01:15:50.405
Don't sink, don't give up.

01:15:51.477 --> 01:15:53.185
Stay awake, please.

01:15:54.689 --> 01:15:56.025
I want to see my son.

01:16:00.736 --> 01:16:04.060
This is his first time alone in home.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.946
As soon as we can, I'll connect you.

01:16:07.285 --> 01:16:09.029
Stay awake, please.

01:16:10.322 --> 01:16:11.888
Robin! Tell me about Aaron.

01:16:20.047 --> 01:16:21.080
Are you Robin Wright?

01:16:22.258 --> 01:16:24.186
- Yes, why?
- Miramount Police.

01:16:24.469 --> 01:16:25.584
Come on board.

01:16:39.834 --> 01:16:42.523
Give her more oxygen, we need her alive!

01:16:42.737 --> 01:16:44.113
Why keep her alive

01:16:44.197 --> 01:16:46.866
if you can manufacture a thousand of old pretties

01:16:46.949 --> 01:16:48.659
like that whore!

01:16:48.743 --> 01:16:50.451
You fucking whore!

01:16:51.182 --> 01:16:53.539
Look what a stunning old lady she's turning into!

01:16:53.623 --> 01:16:56.126
No surgery, nothing. She's a clean cut!

01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:58.169
You can't manufacture that!

01:16:58.252 --> 01:17:00.328
We need her, keep her alive.

01:17:00.546 --> 01:17:02.751
- How far from the hospital?
- We're already there!

01:17:11.243 --> 01:17:13.934
AAROOOON!

01:17:22.677 --> 01:17:23.626
Who are you?

01:17:25.071 --> 01:17:25.762
Dylan.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.402
Dylan Truliner.

01:17:28.991 --> 01:17:31.862
- Do you work for them?
- I used to.

01:17:32.411 --> 01:17:33.907
Until this morning, when they...

01:17:34.664 --> 01:17:37.452
declared the Futurist Congress revolution.

01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:42.582
I am the animator.

01:17:42.797 --> 01:17:45.466
We moved you on the computers for 20 years.

01:17:53.182 --> 01:17:55.637
Head of the Robin Wright department in Miramount.

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:02.066
Your body,

01:18:03.216 --> 01:18:04.929
your face, your smile,

01:18:06.237 --> 01:18:07.613
your sadness...

01:18:09.073 --> 01:18:11.996
That was my whole life for the past 20 years.

01:18:13.786 --> 01:18:14.694
Tell me more.

01:18:16.995 --> 01:18:18.700
I was unemployed animator.

01:18:18.784 --> 01:18:21.277
They put me in Robin Department
for the first film,

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:24.629
"Triple R Strike".

01:18:26.193 --> 01:18:27.794
I was lost.

01:18:28.217 --> 01:18:29.084
Why?

01:18:30.263 --> 01:18:32.504
Because I had no clue who you were.

01:18:33.596 --> 01:18:35.847
I've never seen your anything.

01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:38.801
I had to research you.

01:18:39.471 --> 01:18:40.439
Obsessively.

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:42.391
What was he looking for?

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:45.247
Where you came from, where you went.

01:18:46.527 --> 01:18:49.453
Texas, the all-American girl,
tight jeans and boots.

01:18:51.032 --> 01:18:52.147
After...

01:18:52.742 --> 01:18:54.070
a week, I came

01:18:54.577 --> 01:18:56.618
and pitched them the lasso idea, I had a little

01:18:56.701 --> 01:18:59.404
illustration, drawn in pencil.

01:19:06.088 --> 01:19:08.549
The rebels! They've taken over management!

01:19:08.633 --> 01:19:10.802
- What management?
- Miramount-Nagasaki.

01:19:10.885 --> 01:19:12.470
They've taken over the management floor,

01:19:12.553 --> 01:19:14.374
and stopped the chemistry flow!

01:19:14.457 --> 01:19:16.057
We gonna be real again!

01:19:29.314 --> 01:19:31.257
How do I know if I'm dreaming?

01:19:33.146 --> 01:19:34.710
Do you know what my dreams are?

01:19:36.018 --> 01:19:36.663
Robin?

01:19:41.999 --> 01:19:43.273
Can you see my dream?

01:19:46.527 --> 01:19:49.881
4 cockroaches playing poker
on your lap, it's a dream?

01:19:50.716 --> 01:19:51.275
Yes

01:19:52.451 --> 01:19:53.400
but it's not mine.

01:19:57.056 --> 01:19:58.634
Did any of you...

01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:01.043
think about me that whole time?
About what I went through

01:20:01.127 --> 01:20:02.426
<i>after I sold myself.</i>

01:20:02.812 --> 01:20:05.766
Well, I was... obsessed with you for years.

01:20:05.976 --> 01:20:08.818
- With her, not with me.
- For me, it's the same thing.

01:20:09.735 --> 01:20:10.981
At some point,

01:20:11.487 --> 01:20:13.480
I was... dried up.

01:20:14.365 --> 01:20:16.610
I was afraid they'd take you away from me,

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.488
give you to some...

01:20:18.911 --> 01:20:21.664
up-coming... young genius.

01:20:23.124 --> 01:20:26.443
I've been looking for you all over California.
I needed new...

01:20:27.448 --> 01:20:28.370
Movements.

01:20:28.588 --> 01:20:30.083
A different sensuality,

01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:32.172
things a woman gains...

01:20:32.425 --> 01:20:33.554
with age.

01:20:46.256 --> 01:20:49.559
Target on. Vicinity 0.3 miles. Over.

01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:56.409
Bomb hatch dysfunction. Over.

01:20:56.574 --> 01:20:58.704
Bomb hatch dysfunction. Over.

01:21:02.705 --> 01:21:06.157
Let me go now, man. I'll take care
of this situation.

01:21:48.251 --> 01:21:49.209
Where is everyone?

01:21:49.585 --> 01:21:50.965
They hallucinated themselves out,

01:21:52.088 --> 01:21:53.085
to freedom!

01:21:54.465 --> 01:21:55.723
Where is Dylan?

01:21:55.883 --> 01:21:57.591
Oh, he went with the flow.

01:22:03.266 --> 01:22:05.057
Why am I the only one left?

01:22:06.141 --> 01:22:07.977
Because you're fucked up again.

01:22:08.187 --> 01:22:10.311
What exactly was going through your mind
when you got on that stage?

01:22:10.898 --> 01:22:11.895
What do you mean?

01:22:12.413 --> 01:22:14.496
You invited me, you said I was the symbol.

01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:16.735
Symbol? Symbol of what?

01:22:17.572 --> 01:22:19.980
The chemical revolution, Jeff, you said.

01:22:20.064 --> 01:22:22.313
You're not a symbol. You're nothing!

01:22:23.269 --> 01:22:25.066
The symbol is what we created of you.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.174
Robin, look at yourself. Does that look
like a symbol?

01:22:34.286 --> 01:22:36.534
It was suicide what you did up there on stage.

01:22:37.508 --> 01:22:39.798
You left us no choice.

01:23:17.882 --> 01:23:19.128
How do you like it?

01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:23.687
A bullet to the head.

01:23:24.914 --> 01:23:25.605
One.

01:23:26.637 --> 01:23:27.798
But quick.

01:23:29.731 --> 01:23:32.808
Quick as possible, I just want to get out
of this hallucination.

01:23:35.775 --> 01:23:37.436
After all these years,

01:23:37.944 --> 01:23:40.322
it is time you knew that this is no hallucination.

01:23:42.532 --> 01:23:43.519
This is our lives.

01:23:44.303 --> 01:23:45.096
Robin.

01:24:07.306 --> 01:24:09.797
The following case is particularly interesting.

01:24:10.226 --> 01:24:13.066
The patient, who some of you might know,
was an actress once.

01:24:13.502 --> 01:24:14.844
I forget her name.

01:24:15.523 --> 01:24:18.685
She suffered severe hallucinogenic contamination...

01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:20.604
during the Abrahama uprising.

01:24:20.936 --> 01:24:23.267
For some 4 months now, she's been convinced that her life

01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:25.815
everything she's experienced,

01:24:26.325 --> 01:24:28.070
is all a hallucination.

01:24:28.411 --> 01:24:29.588
It was so extreme,

01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:32.622
that when the rescue forces reached Abrahama,

01:24:32.858 --> 01:24:34.230
she begged the chief fireman

01:24:34.314 --> 01:24:36.745
to put a bullet in her head.

01:24:37.295 --> 01:24:39.335
She's a lost case, hopeless.

01:24:39.797 --> 01:24:41.790
So much so that we've decided to freeze her.

01:24:41.959 --> 01:24:46.968
With today's advancements of liquid nitrogen
can easily keep her frozen for 70 years.

01:24:48.639 --> 01:24:49.968
Bring it down.

01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:48.422
Aaron?

01:25:49.933 --> 01:25:50.725
Aaron?

01:26:05.091 --> 01:26:06.337
Aaron, you heard me!

01:26:06.810 --> 01:26:08.183
You heard me calling you!

01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:10.884
Yeah, Mom, I heard you. Of course I did.

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.137
What's so weird about that?

01:26:48.092 --> 01:26:50.085
And now for the weather.

01:26:50.386 --> 01:26:52.190
The Weather Company apologizes

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:54.465
for the lack of complete symmetry of the rainbows

01:26:54.549 --> 01:26:56.941
for the past 2 days. On the other hand,

01:26:57.429 --> 01:26:59.086
symmetry contradicts art.

01:27:13.078 --> 01:27:13.897
Robin...

01:27:15.132 --> 01:27:18.245
You must release your mind from the thoughts.

01:27:21.501 --> 01:27:23.162
I don't understand.

01:27:23.836 --> 01:27:24.785
What?

01:27:26.297 --> 01:27:28.797
I was first to wake up in the distant future.

01:27:32.776 --> 01:27:35.671
It's like bringing a diver back from the bends.

01:27:36.557 --> 01:27:39.725
You have to start as far away as possible,

01:27:39.936 --> 01:27:42.475
with the things you know from childhood.

01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:47.181
This is the setup we chose for you.

01:27:47.485 --> 01:27:49.362
The early 1980s.

01:27:51.948 --> 01:27:53.229
But now, Robin,

01:27:54.692 --> 01:27:56.283
you have a visitor.

01:27:56.676 --> 01:27:58.743
Do you feel ready for him?

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.085
What are you doing here?

01:28:13.386 --> 01:28:14.465
I waited for you.

01:28:14.887 --> 01:28:16.292
- For me?
- Yes.

01:28:18.391 --> 01:28:21.431
For the moment that you could be... thawed.

01:28:21.734 --> 01:28:23.845
When medicine could advance enough

01:28:23.929 --> 01:28:25.261
to fix you.

01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:28.859
- You waited for me all those years?
- Yes.

01:28:30.611 --> 01:28:32.327
I was the last person to see you,

01:28:32.723 --> 01:28:34.489
I had a responsibility.

01:28:37.971 --> 01:28:39.655
They say Sarah's fine.

01:28:41.085 --> 01:28:44.236
She was saved from the Abrahama revolt,
whatever that means.

01:28:46.586 --> 01:28:48.875
And now, they're looking for...

01:28:49.797 --> 01:28:50.669
my Aaron.

01:28:57.614 --> 01:29:00.811
This is Aaron's original DNA listing.

01:29:01.326 --> 01:29:03.394
I've been looking for him for a very long time...

01:29:03.478 --> 01:29:05.387
- since I knew they were about to thaw you.
- And?

01:29:08.858 --> 01:29:09.637
There is no sign.

01:29:11.098 --> 01:29:12.166
No trace.

01:29:13.404 --> 01:29:15.704
I don't... think he is with us anymore.

01:29:15.788 --> 01:29:18.346
What do you mean, "not with us?" What do you,
what you mean... in this world?

01:29:18.826 --> 01:29:20.653
Or that he's not alive, what are you saying?

01:29:20.736 --> 01:29:22.704
What are you saying, he's... he's dead?

01:29:22.787 --> 01:29:24.796
It's much more complicated, Robin.

01:29:24.957 --> 01:29:27.017
The world... today

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.467
is unlike the world you came from.

01:29:30.303 --> 01:29:33.084
To find Aaron, alive or not,

01:29:33.729 --> 01:29:36.124
we have to go on a very long journey.

01:29:38.054 --> 01:29:40.462
What do you think, there is a direction?
There is a clue?

01:29:41.808 --> 01:29:42.721
I hope so.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.836
But we have to start somewhere.

01:29:48.606 --> 01:29:50.899
I'm here to take you out into the Big City.

01:30:28.813 --> 01:30:31.536
No one told me for how long I've been frozen.

01:30:34.235 --> 01:30:36.904
Could have been a year, could have been 20.

01:30:41.119 --> 01:30:43.858
Time is now a subjective matter.

01:30:44.078 --> 01:30:45.566
You decide in your mind,

01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:47.367
when day breaks,

01:30:47.582 --> 01:30:48.851
or when the moon fades.

01:30:51.419 --> 01:30:55.825
After a while you probably lose the
numeric calendar, as we once knew it.

01:31:11.314 --> 01:31:14.388
New York is now a city of suspended gardens.

01:31:15.359 --> 01:31:18.824
That reach the sky,
the wild colors they strike you full force,

01:31:18.908 --> 01:31:21.024
and the people are so beautiful,

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.151
they're so young and radiant.

01:31:24.118 --> 01:31:27.780
Exuding serenity in beauty and sexuality.

01:31:31.375 --> 01:31:32.918
There's no more ego.

01:31:33.574 --> 01:31:35.752
Thanks to Chemistry we've been redeemed.

01:31:36.589 --> 01:31:37.673
There is no ego,

01:31:37.757 --> 01:31:39.926
no competition, no violence, no war,

01:31:40.009 --> 01:31:41.587
no strong or weak,

01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:43.384
no secrets.

01:31:44.222 --> 01:31:45.365
Everyone is...

01:31:46.766 --> 01:31:48.261
what they are.

01:31:48.768 --> 01:31:50.844
Everyone is what they want to be.

01:31:51.312 --> 01:31:54.350
And while they consume their new personality,

01:31:54.565 --> 01:31:57.983
they spread in the air those
pheromones that your mind

01:31:58.361 --> 01:32:00.567
translates into an image.

01:32:04.367 --> 01:32:07.451
There is no way I can imagine Aaron in this world.

01:32:23.845 --> 01:32:27.022
This street holds the wisdom of a millennium.

01:32:27.266 --> 01:32:30.762
A year ago, when I was consuming
Greek mythology

01:32:32.145 --> 01:32:35.013
I woke up half-man, half-God.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.651
I impregnated one of Zeus's daughters,

01:32:38.734 --> 01:32:40.727
I I burned an entire city

01:32:40.945 --> 01:32:44.190
and then I fucked this city, and then
I burned it and I punished it.

01:32:44.407 --> 01:32:45.680
It's all about feelings.

01:33:32.317 --> 01:33:33.719
Just make a choice

01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:37.955
and you feel whatever you want.

01:33:39.504 --> 01:33:41.836
What do you choose, Robin?

01:33:43.626 --> 01:33:44.631
Usher syndrome.

01:33:48.529 --> 01:33:50.077
What level of Usher syndrome?

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.471
I think, it's Type 2,

01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:55.194
Why do you need this?

01:33:55.918 --> 01:33:57.936
- Are you researching someone?
- No.

01:33:59.190 --> 01:34:00.898
'I'm missing someone.

01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:57.290
May you build ladder to the star...

01:34:57.957 --> 01:35:00.496
climb on every...

01:35:00.877 --> 01:35:02.953
may you stay...

01:35:07.258 --> 01:35:09.548
forever young.

01:35:13.848 --> 01:35:15.826
Somewhere... out there...

01:35:16.974 --> 01:35:17.619
there's Sarah.

01:35:19.479 --> 01:35:20.953
She's a naturalist now.

01:35:23.561 --> 01:35:25.163
No-no-no. Don't, don't.

01:35:25.247 --> 01:35:26.935
Won't do you any good.

01:35:27.361 --> 01:35:29.412
You'll never be able to recognize and she won't...

01:35:30.156 --> 01:35:31.568
won't know who you are, anyway.

01:35:33.034 --> 01:35:34.315
But trust me,

01:35:35.286 --> 01:35:36.947
Robin, she's happy.

01:35:38.414 --> 01:35:40.098
She's one of the only people who still

01:35:40.182 --> 01:35:42.825
brings children into the world.

01:38:43.933 --> 01:38:46.572
What if I don't want to take part
in the chemical party?

01:38:49.147 --> 01:38:50.854
Then you'll realise very soon

01:38:50.938 --> 01:38:52.181
that you can't.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.191
Because you won't be part of this world.

01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:56.106
And where will I be?

01:38:57.155 --> 01:38:58.401
On the other side.

01:38:58.781 --> 01:39:00.325
What's on the other side, Dylan?

01:39:01.242 --> 01:39:01.855
Truth.

01:39:03.452 --> 01:39:05.197
And who is on the other side?

01:39:06.247 --> 01:39:08.371
Ones who didn't pass over,

01:39:08.583 --> 01:39:10.675
who aren't taking part in the chemical party,

01:39:10.759 --> 01:39:14.212
and of course, everyone who operates
the world, you see here.

01:39:20.582 --> 01:39:21.716
Have you been there?

01:39:22.388 --> 01:39:23.835
- No.
- Why not?

01:39:24.432 --> 01:39:26.176
Because I don't know if you can get back.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.470
It's like coming back from death.

01:39:29.937 --> 01:39:32.690
Maybe some have, but... we'll never know.

01:39:32.773 --> 01:39:36.019
Then send me there, and I'll tell you
what it's like on the other side.

01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:40.573
Do you have a way to send me there?

01:39:45.802 --> 01:39:46.355
Yes.

01:39:47.944 --> 01:39:50.187
- Is it at home... the substance?
- It's...

01:39:50.659 --> 01:39:52.235
not a chemical cocktail.

01:39:53.059 --> 01:39:54.220
It's kind of a... a...

01:39:55.463 --> 01:39:56.126
whiteout.

01:39:57.381 --> 01:40:00.990
That deletes all the chemical influences
in a second.

01:40:02.386 --> 01:40:06.053
And the truth... comes right out.

01:40:08.351 --> 01:40:09.264
And where is it?

01:40:21.339 --> 01:40:24.565
It's like the cyanide capsules the Nazis had,

01:40:26.202 --> 01:40:27.661
in case of surrender.

01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:30.646
When I left the old world

01:40:31.249 --> 01:40:32.147
I took one.

01:40:34.293 --> 01:40:35.461
It was my compensation

01:40:35.545 --> 01:40:37.003
from Miramount-Nagasaki

01:40:37.087 --> 01:40:39.643
that's what I asked them for after 20 years of work.

01:40:40.251 --> 01:40:41.668
This little capsule.

01:40:45.263 --> 01:40:46.342
I want it.

01:40:50.726 --> 01:40:52.704
And if your son comes back, while you're gone?

01:40:52.788 --> 01:40:55.565
And if he's there? What if he is
on the other side? That's more likely.

01:40:56.274 --> 01:40:57.583
This is all I have left.

01:40:58.201 --> 01:40:59.301
Robin, if you take it,

01:40:59.828 --> 01:41:01.231
you're leaving, you're leaving me.

01:41:01.314 --> 01:41:02.495
You can't do that.

01:41:03.547 --> 01:41:04.394
Not now.

01:41:04.581 --> 01:41:06.033
Then come with me.

01:41:06.325 --> 01:41:09.085
I can't, the capsule is strong enough
only for one person.

01:41:12.165 --> 01:41:14.496
It's your choice, and I'll give you
anything you want.

01:41:18.212 --> 01:41:19.212
I love you.

01:41:19.672 --> 01:41:21.924
Robin, I have always loved you.

01:41:22.008 --> 01:41:23.799
I loved you for 20 years

01:41:24.192 --> 01:41:27.012
when I didn't even know you, and you
were my entire world.

01:41:27.472 --> 01:41:29.298
And I loved you for 20 more years

01:41:29.515 --> 01:41:31.057
where I waited every hour

01:41:31.141 --> 01:41:33.011
of every day for you to come back.

01:41:43.779 --> 01:41:45.458
Promise me you're not gonna look at the real me.

01:41:46.491 --> 01:41:48.610
Promise me you'll remember me this way.

01:41:53.333 --> 01:41:54.253
I promise.

01:41:57.210 --> 01:41:58.224
I love you.

01:44:18.476 --> 01:44:20.693
Are there any doctors left in this world?

01:44:22.688 --> 01:44:24.100
Yes, there are.

01:44:24.315 --> 01:44:25.597
Where are they?

01:44:27.985 --> 01:44:29.314
Up above.

01:47:00.304 --> 01:47:01.134
Excuse me.

01:47:04.433 --> 01:47:07.158
Can you tell me where I can find an ENT

01:47:07.241 --> 01:47:09.345
physician named Dr. Barker?

01:47:10.273 --> 01:47:11.139
Sure.

01:47:11.357 --> 01:47:13.267
His cabin will be at the end of the corridor.

01:47:55.985 --> 01:47:58.904
- I knew you would never cross over to the other side.
- Oh!

01:48:00.031 --> 01:48:02.700
Don't be so impressed that I am still here.

01:48:03.534 --> 01:48:06.073
Being here, on this side of the truth,

01:48:06.412 --> 01:48:08.120
is not so brave.

01:48:28.434 --> 01:48:30.367
Nothing has really changed, has it?

01:48:31.145 --> 01:48:33.850
Once we just masked the truth with...

01:48:34.232 --> 01:48:35.863
antidepressants, drugs

01:48:35.947 --> 01:48:37.964
that, um... concealed, lied.

01:48:38.710 --> 01:48:40.175
Now we reinvent the truth.

01:48:41.125 --> 01:48:42.650
It's not such a big difference.

01:48:43.449 --> 01:48:46.368
Drugs were just got much, much better.

01:48:48.277 --> 01:48:51.142
And is there... no choice?

01:48:54.377 --> 01:48:56.198
The only choice is between

01:48:56.282 --> 01:48:58.171
waiting for death here

01:48:58.881 --> 01:49:01.376
in this filth of truth,

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:04.174
or hallucinating over there.

01:49:06.722 --> 01:49:09.724
Maybe it's better over there, dreaming.

01:49:14.313 --> 01:49:15.276
And Aaron?

01:49:27.618 --> 01:49:29.944
Aaron waited for you here,

01:49:30.454 --> 01:49:32.080
all of the years.

01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:37.167
19 years, he waited for you to come back.

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:44.712
His condition got worse and worse, and, um...

01:49:46.095 --> 01:49:48.504
he was almost totally blind, by the end.

01:49:49.265 --> 01:49:50.381
But he...

01:49:50.791 --> 01:49:52.165
he didn't cross over.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.200
Even though I told him to.

01:49:56.467 --> 01:50:00.554
I begged him to, because I knew that I wouldn't
be here forever to help take care of him.

01:50:05.531 --> 01:50:08.402
Six months ago, he crossed over.

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:11.453
He is someone else now

01:50:12.705 --> 01:50:16.537
in the world of chemical fantasy,
over on the other side.

01:50:21.159 --> 01:50:22.707
6 months it is?

01:50:23.549 --> 01:50:25.506
Exactly 6 months ago.

01:50:26.552 --> 01:50:28.379
He just broke down, Robin.

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:32.176
I think he thought that I was going to die and...

01:50:33.110 --> 01:50:35.202
He no longer believed that you would ever come back.

01:50:52.662 --> 01:50:55.414
Basically there is no way to find Aaron.

01:50:57.625 --> 01:50:59.784
Here, he doesn't exist.

01:51:00.753 --> 01:51:03.806
And on the other side, there is no way
of knowing who he is now.

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:09.086
But you can still go back there,

01:51:09.303 --> 01:51:10.383
and that's something to.

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:13.541
That's better than waiting for death.

01:51:19.522 --> 01:51:21.049
And on this other side...

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:23.733
Yeah, what about it?

01:51:25.366 --> 01:51:27.283
Can I go back to where I came from?

01:51:30.867 --> 01:51:34.284
There is no such thing as "the place
that you came from".

01:51:36.247 --> 01:51:38.038
You invented it.

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:42.295
You will go where your mind

01:51:42.378 --> 01:51:44.228
and your chemistry will take you.

01:51:45.339 --> 01:51:47.049
And after your experience of here, there

01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:49.672
will be a place in your consciousness

01:51:49.927 --> 01:51:51.295
completely different from any

01:51:51.379 --> 01:51:52.501
you have been to before.

01:51:55.766 --> 01:51:57.843
Your past is dead, Robin.

01:52:07.278 --> 01:52:08.445
I'll fix you an ampule.

01:52:09.365 --> 01:52:11.571
And then I will call the kite.

01:52:45.942 --> 01:52:47.852
Do you know where you're going, Robin?

01:52:50.947 --> 01:52:51.984
Yes, I know.
