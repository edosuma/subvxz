00:02.000 --> 00:08.040
This programme contains strong
language

00:11.320 --> 00:13.040
Ladies and Gentlemen...

00:13.040 --> 00:15.560
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!

00:24.360 --> 00:27.240
Hello! Come in, come in!

00:27.240 --> 00:30.520
I'm just making some Brown Bread.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.840
It's my mother's recipe.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.840
It's a secret!

00:33.840 --> 00:35.720
THUMPING

00:35.720 --> 00:37.400
What do you want, Grandad?

00:37.400 --> 00:40.520
I'm too weak to get down the stairs.
Well, use the lift!

00:40.520 --> 00:44.840
I'm in the kitchen on the second
floor beside the swimming pool!

00:44.840 --> 00:46.840
PHONE RINGS

00:46.840 --> 00:49.120
Excuse me.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.960
Mammy, mammy, mammy, mammy, mammy!

00:50.960 --> 00:52.800
I'll get it... I'm sure it's Mick.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.680
Mick me arse!

00:54.680 --> 00:59.400
Now that's Mick,
the latest NEW boyfriend.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.760
I'm not even allowed
to answer me own phone now.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.320
I go to answer me phone
I get a feckin' rugby tackle...

01:05.840 --> 01:09.160
I don't get a rugby tackle
when I'm on me way down
to pay the feckin' bill!

01:10.720 --> 01:13.200
Oh, yes, and

01:13.200 --> 01:16.440
Mick is a secret. Mmm...

01:16.440 --> 01:18.840
he must be ugly!

01:18.840 --> 01:22.440
Oh, grow up, for God's sake!
Who is it, Cathy?

01:22.440 --> 01:24.760
It's a heavy breather.
I'm hanging up.

01:24.760 --> 01:28.520
Oh, no, don't... it might be your
Uncle Terry. His asthma is very bad.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.160
Oh! Hello?

01:31.160 --> 01:33.800
Ye dirty bastard!

01:33.800 --> 01:37.200
What did he say?
"If you can guess what I have
in my hand, you can have it."

01:37.200 --> 01:38.840
Gimme the phone!

01:38.840 --> 01:42.360
Hello? If it fits in ONE hand
you can feckin' keep it!

01:43.880 --> 01:45.400
Hello?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.240
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

01:49.920 --> 01:53.760
God, Mammy,
you're well able for them.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.560
I've no feckin' time for them.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.560
I had one of them
on two weeks ago...

01:58.560 --> 02:01.600
He said "If you come down to the
corner I'll show you me willy."

02:01.600 --> 02:03.840
Dirty bastard...

02:03.840 --> 02:06.640
Never feckin' turned up!

02:09.560 --> 02:13.720
All right Mammy? Hello, Rory,
do you want a cup of tea?

02:13.720 --> 02:15.640
No. Are you going into town?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.680
Yeah! Now, don't you go getting
some girl into trouble.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
I won't.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.920
How are you, Agnes? Hiya, Winnie.

02:27.920 --> 02:32.120
Are you putting the kettle on
or what? Hang on -
I'm not on feckin' wheels!

02:32.120 --> 02:34.080
Can you believe it, Agnes?

02:34.080 --> 02:35.600
Your Dermot getting married!

02:35.600 --> 02:38.600
I know, it's all very exciting.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.920
Of course this will be your first
WHITE wedding, won't it, Agnes?

02:45.480 --> 02:46.720
Meaning?

02:46.720 --> 02:51.240
Well, your Cathy was married
in a registry office in London,
and we all know how that ended.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.280
Will you keep your
feckin' voice down?

02:53.280 --> 02:54.440
PHONE RINGS

02:54.440 --> 02:56.200
That's that dirty bastard again!

02:57.760 --> 02:59.360
Hello, Hornball.

03:00.960 --> 03:06.000
how would you like me to grab you by
the willy and swing you round the
room like a windmill?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Aha... yes! Hold on, Mick.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.520
I'll get her for you.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.560
Cathy, Ca-Cathy, it's Mick,
it's Mick for you!

03:15.560 --> 03:17.720
Mammy!
I think we had a crossed line...

03:17.720 --> 03:19.680
there was voices and all...

03:19.680 --> 03:22.360
he must be in a train station.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.120
Hello, son! Aha...

03:25.120 --> 03:27.120
you looking for a light?

03:27.120 --> 03:29.440
Nice one, Mammy!
Hello, Mrs McGoogan!

03:29.440 --> 03:33.360
Hiya, Dermot son. Ah,
congratulations on your engagement.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.520
I'm delighted for yourself and Maria.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.040
You look tired, love.
I'll make you a cuppa tea.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.640
Why don't you lie down there
in the ashtray?

03:39.640 --> 03:41.440
THUMPING

03:41.440 --> 03:44.400
What do you want, Grandad?

03:44.400 --> 03:47.440
Help me! I'm stuck in the lift!

03:49.600 --> 03:52.920
Cathy, are you still up there? Yes!

03:52.920 --> 03:55.440
No, you're not. I can fuckin'
see you standing there...

03:55.440 --> 03:58.000
she's standing there!

03:58.920 --> 04:02.920
Well, go into
your Grandad's bedroom and
get him out of the feckin' wardrobe.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.120
What's WRONG, Dermot?

04:08.120 --> 04:11.560
Mrs Nicholson is talking about
dropping in to see you. Oh, lovely!

04:11.560 --> 04:14.680
At last, I get to meet her!
She's very posh, Mammy.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.360
And so are we.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.360
We have a series on the BBC.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.120
I don't think she has!

04:22.160 --> 04:25.560
Yeah, Mammy. Maria's parents
don't know what I do.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.440
I just told them I was in PR.
I don't think they'd like...

04:29.440 --> 04:30.800
this!

04:30.800 --> 04:32.120
Anti-smokers, are they?

04:32.120 --> 04:34.320
No. No buts!

04:37.880 --> 04:40.040
No, Mammy... me dressing up
in costumes.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.480
I'm sure Mrs Nicholson
is just like any mother.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.160
Once her daughter is happy, she
won't care what you feckin' do!

04:46.160 --> 04:50.640
Really, Dermot, don't you
be worrying about her.
When she leaves this house

04:50.640 --> 04:55.160
she'll know that Maria is marrying
into the finest family in Finglas!

04:55.160 --> 04:59.640
And you're doing it the right way,
son, not like your brother Mark.
What was wrong with Mark's wedding?

04:59.640 --> 05:02.920
Well, Betty...
You know... it was a bit of a rush...

05:04.080 --> 05:08.800
She was pregnant! Oh, Winnie, drag
yourself in to the 26th century.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.440
So what? Look at them now.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.400
A lovely house in Finglas,
and a beautiful child in Bono,

05:14.400 --> 05:16.960
and Mark and Betty are
as happy as happy can be.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.760
Mark and Betty had a row.
She threw him out!

05:19.760 --> 05:21.800
Jesus - that the time?
Goodnight, Winnie. Come on!

05:21.800 --> 05:25.120
Jesus, Agnes,
I'm only after getting my tea!

05:25.120 --> 05:28.360
Mind you don't spill it
getting over the hedge! Goodnight!

05:30.760 --> 05:32.640
Is Mark still asleep?

05:32.640 --> 05:36.240
Yes. He was exhausted and upset
when he got here last night.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.120
I think we should put him on a
suicide watch. Will you stop, Rory?

05:40.120 --> 05:43.160
I took all the tablets out of
the first aid kit and hid them!

05:43.160 --> 05:46.080
The only thing that was in the first
aid kit was indigestion tablets!

05:46.080 --> 05:48.440
What did he want him to do...
shit himself to death?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.040
You can't do that, Cathy, can you?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.000
Goodbye, cruel world!
FARTING NOISE

05:58.880 --> 06:01.280
Well, at least my son
came home here.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.480
My door is always open.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.920
That's the problem.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.520
I beg you pardon, Missy?
He's a married man, Mammy,
he shouldn't be coming here.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.960
Should he not?
Well, that's funny. You're married
and you're fuckin' here!

06:14.720 --> 06:19.600
Now look, when Mark Brown
gets down here,
we all pretend we know nothing.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.800
Jesus, that's him now.
Everybody hide!

06:22.800 --> 06:25.800
No, no, no!
Everybody just look normal.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.320
Hiya, Mark! Howyeh!

06:31.320 --> 06:33.640
Hiya Ma! Hello son...

06:33.640 --> 06:35.640
good morning! Morning!

06:35.640 --> 06:37.800
Sit down there in Mammy's chair!

06:37.800 --> 06:39.280
Come on!

06:41.560 --> 06:45.200
All right, Rory?
BURSTS INTO SOBS

06:52.200 --> 06:54.160
You all right? Yeah, grand.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.440
Do you wanna talk about it? No.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.560
It helps to talk about it, Mark.
Believe me, I know.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.640
Shut up, you. Leave the child alone!

07:01.640 --> 07:03.320
Right, I'm off to work.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.720
Right, see you later, love. 
See you later, Ma. Bye, love.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.640
(Say goodbye, say goodbye! What?)

07:10.640 --> 07:12.400
All me sharp tools are missing!

07:16.320 --> 07:18.120
Rory Brown!

07:24.120 --> 07:26.960
It was for your own good, Marko!

07:26.960 --> 07:29.120
I'll see yous later!

07:29.120 --> 07:32.320
I'll see you... I'll see you,
love... Have a nice day at work now!

07:35.960 --> 07:37.800
Ya feckin' eejit!

07:50.840 --> 07:53.280
DOORBELL RINGS

07:58.040 --> 08:00.640
Look at you! Diet Coke break!

08:03.680 --> 08:04.640
Yes?

08:04.640 --> 08:08.360
Hello, Agnes darling!
Hillary Nicholson!

08:08.360 --> 08:11.880
What? Maria's mother! Oh, of course!

08:11.880 --> 08:18.040
I was in the area, and I just
thought I'd pop in for a pre-nuptial
chat, as it were. Come in, come in!

08:18.040 --> 08:20.720
Oh, thank you. Oh, bad leg?

08:20.720 --> 08:24.480
Yes, I injured it a couple
of weeks ago - skiing accident.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.840
I was on the piste.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.120
Drink - will we ever feckin' learn?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.240
Give me that!

08:36.600 --> 08:38.760
Would you like a cushion
for that foot?

08:38.760 --> 08:44.040
Oh, no, no, actually it's not sore
and this comes off tomorrow. Oh!

08:44.040 --> 08:46.400
Oh, wallpaper!

08:46.400 --> 08:49.080
Oh, how very...eighties!

08:49.080 --> 08:52.480
Well, the paper went up in '84, but
the border didn't go up till '92.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.120
Oh, I see.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.680
Hillary... what's your maiden name?

08:58.680 --> 09:03.320
Sheridan. I knew I knew your face,
John Sheridan, the clerk
of St Jarleth's Church...

09:03.320 --> 09:05.320
he was your father? That's right.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.680
Yeah. Nice man. Thank you...

09:07.680 --> 09:09.200
now where was I?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.400
Oh, yes, Maria's wedding.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.800
And Dermot's.
She's not marrying herself!

09:15.800 --> 09:20.520
Yes, of course. I just
wanted to have a little chat...

09:20.520 --> 09:22.840
make sure we don't clash on the day.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.560
You and me clash? Not at all.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.440
You keep your fuckin' mouth shut,
we'll be grand.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.880
DOOR CLOSES

09:30.760 --> 09:33.960
Betty? Betty?

09:34.520 --> 09:37.640
What do you want?
Is my husband here?

09:37.640 --> 09:39.360
Betty, I wish you'd use his name.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.360
Mark... Ma-ha-hark..

09:41.360 --> 09:45.000
I didn't go through
a hundred hours of labour
and then forget to name him.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.680
Nobody is in labour for a hundred
hours, not even Agnes Brown.

09:48.680 --> 09:53.840
I'll have you know, I was so
long in labour on that child,
they had to shave me twice!

09:53.840 --> 09:55.840
Well, that's when he was your son.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.760
He's my husband now.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.320
He was my son for a long time
before he was your husband.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.920
So is he here or not?
No, but he'll be home shortly,
for a decent bit of dinner.

10:05.920 --> 10:11.280
Cook him as many dinners as you like,
but you tell him if it's a
wife he wants, he'd better call ME!

10:11.280 --> 10:15.440
A wife? Don't make me laugh.
It's a wife my son needs...

10:15.440 --> 10:17.080
not a fuckin' sample!

10:23.240 --> 10:24.800
Hello!

10:24.800 --> 10:29.760
Um, I think I'll just
slip out the back way.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.520
Hello?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.880
Wait a minute!

10:41.880 --> 10:43.640
I bookin' live here!

10:43.640 --> 10:45.360
Go on, out... OUT!

10:48.040 --> 10:52.000
When are you going to realise your
sons are grown men and stop
treating them like children?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.080
As soon as they can find
themselves a woman that's
good enough to replace ME.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.240
You are one bitch!

10:57.240 --> 10:59.880
Look at me, I'm bookin' shakin'.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.120
Wagon! Baggy arse!

11:02.120 --> 11:04.240
Ah, shag off!

11:04.240 --> 11:07.080
You watch your fuckin' language
in my house!

11:08.600 --> 11:12.200
And we all know your hair
is fuckin' dyed.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.880
I thought that went well!

11:17.000 --> 11:20.880
So Hillary... You were saying?
Ah, yes, yes.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.640
Clothes for the wedding, Agnes,
I was talking about clothes!

11:24.640 --> 11:29.920
Clothes? Exactly. I wouldn't
want us to be dressed alike!

11:29.920 --> 11:31.560
Neither would fuckin' I.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.760
Jesus, Grandad, come on.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.600
Let's get you upstairs.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.880
Why don't I make the two of us
a nice cup of tea
and we can discuss it? 

11:44.880 --> 11:49.320
you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Am I right, am I right?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.040
Tea? Cup of tea?

11:54.960 --> 11:57.440
Er, yes, yes... No, no.

11:57.440 --> 12:02.640
Um, look, my outfit for the wedding.
I've had it put by at Harvey Nicks.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.400
You're hardly likely
to be shopping there, are you?

12:05.400 --> 12:08.720
No. But I have got me eye
on a beautiful suit.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.520
I seen it in the window
of Marcelle's Boutique!

12:10.520 --> 12:14.720
Marcelle's? Oh, well, you'd
need a mortgage to shop there.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.800
Oh, then it'll probably
be San Michelle!

12:18.800 --> 12:22.960
Oh, St Michael.
Oh, Agnes, you are so funny!

12:22.960 --> 12:25.240
Amn't I... fuckin' hilarious.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.880
Well, I mustn't keep you.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.800
I need to get to the gym,
make some appointments...

12:28.800 --> 12:31.840
as soon as this is off,
I'm getting back into shape.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.200
What shape are you going for...
Balloon, is it?

12:35.800 --> 12:38.240
You might like
to visit the gym yourself.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.840
I will, when they start
playing feckin' bingo there.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.480
I'll get you a cup of tea... Oh, no.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.920
I'll get you a cuppa tea!

12:48.920 --> 12:53.520
Oh, and Hillary,
thank you very much for the heads up
about the clothes for the wedding.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.720
Yes, OK!

12:55.720 --> 12:57.840
Just steer clear of silver.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.520
Silver - you're wearing silver?

12:59.520 --> 13:01.480
Yes.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.720
She's wearing fuckin' silver.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.800
She must be coming as RoboCop!

13:16.280 --> 13:18.800
Was that not the door? 
I didn't hear it.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.480
Are you expecting somebody?

13:20.480 --> 13:23.600
No, I just thought I heard the door.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.400
Oh, a sample!

13:42.680 --> 13:43.760
I need a size six.

13:59.240 --> 14:04.080
Well, hello... if it isn't
Cathy's little secret! I'm sorry?

14:04.080 --> 14:06.920
Come in. She's not ready yet
but she'll be down in a minute.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.880
That's very kind, thank you!

14:09.880 --> 14:11.880
Oh, sit down, sit down...

14:13.960 --> 14:16.320
I'm Cathy's mother... Agnes. Hi!

14:19.280 --> 14:21.360
Nice to meet you!

14:22.680 --> 14:26.240
So tell me a little about yourself?
Me? There's very little to tell.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.320
Well... where are you from? Wicklow.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.360
Right...

14:30.360 --> 14:33.280
And brothers and sisters?
No. I'm an only child. Aw!

14:33.280 --> 14:36.400
Did Daddy have a low sperm count?

14:41.080 --> 14:43.080
I'm sorry? Now look...

14:43.080 --> 14:47.880
I won't beat around the bush.
Are you sleeping with my daughter?
Nooooh!

14:47.880 --> 14:50.800
Get a feckin' move on -
she won't hang around forever.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.440
She likes a bit of...
you know... pumpy, pumpy!

14:53.440 --> 14:56.200
All right, Mammy! Hello love. Hello.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.680
Excuse me a second.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.040
Cathy, don't be so
feckin' bad mannered!

15:07.040 --> 15:11.840
What? You just walked past him
like he was a perfect stranger! Who?
Mick, your boyfriend!

15:11.840 --> 15:13.680
That's not Mick.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.960
What?

15:20.600 --> 15:24.240
That man in there
is not my boyfriend.

15:24.240 --> 15:28.240
Well, who is he, then? I don't know.
You're the one
that's talking to him.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.880
Excuse me a second.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.720
Cathy... get rid of him!

15:41.720 --> 15:44.320
He is YOUR problem.
You get rid of him!

15:47.240 --> 15:50.320
I'm sorry about that...
there's been a mistake - yeah.

15:50.320 --> 15:54.080
See, you were supposed to be Mick...
you know... and you're not Mick...

15:54.080 --> 15:57.280
And you've no sperms.
Now look... wha...

15:57.280 --> 15:59.280
it's...

15:59.280 --> 16:01.520
my...get out!

16:01.520 --> 16:03.240
I'm sorry?

16:03.240 --> 16:06.960
Come on... out! Go on... get out,
out, out, out, out...

16:08.160 --> 16:09.440
OUT!

16:09.440 --> 16:13.400
Wait... now,
For just one euro a week. Son... Go!

16:13.400 --> 16:15.360
Have you thought
about life insurance?

16:15.360 --> 16:18.480
No... but I'd go for another kiss!
No, thank you,

16:22.840 --> 16:27.240
"You should visit the gym yourself,"
she says. YOU in a gym.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.120
Yeah... well I used to do all that!

16:29.120 --> 16:32.120
Did yeah? Oh, Jeez, yes.
I used to do the...

16:33.840 --> 16:36.160
I could tell you stories.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.200
I remember I went to a
Turkish Bath once in Dame Street.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.920
I was never so embarrassed
in me life.

16:41.920 --> 16:46.000
Why? I went in and it was
all steam everywhere,
so I took off all me clothes.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.640
I'm there in me nude
and when the steam cleared,
I was in a fuckin' chip shop!

16:55.200 --> 16:57.320
Do you want salt
and vinegar on that?

16:58.920 --> 17:01.480
Same again, Pet? 
Yes, it's about time!

17:03.920 --> 17:07.160
Have you got a minute, Mammy?
Yes, all the time in the world
for you chicken honey.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.320
What is it, love? Mammy...

17:09.320 --> 17:14.400
Have you ever wondered WHY
I never wanted to play
for Mark's football team?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.120
I know why, love.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.920
You do? I've known for years.
I just couldn't say anything to you.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.240
You're shite!

17:23.880 --> 17:26.920
You're good at some things,
but football isn't one of them.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.440
Mammy, you never listen to me!

17:29.440 --> 17:32.080
Rory, you can't even do
a feckin' headier!

17:33.640 --> 17:36.400
There you go, pet! Thanks, Winnie.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.200
Jaysus.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.280
she hasn't wasted much time! Who?

17:41.280 --> 17:43.080
Your Mark's Betty. Look!

17:48.040 --> 17:49.760
Don't be jumping to conclusions.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.600
It could be perfectly innocent.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.560
Remember before we were married
and you accused me of
going off with your Jacko?

17:54.560 --> 18:00.480
Well, you told Esther Cowan that
my Jacko had a scar on his willy!

18:00.480 --> 18:01.880
I did NOT say that.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.080
I said it FELT like a scar!

18:04.080 --> 18:06.280
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

18:11.680 --> 18:14.080
This could be more serious
than I thought.

18:16.920 --> 18:17.960
Oh, now!

18:17.960 --> 18:21.000
Wouldn't you love to be her.
Who? Sarah Le Pippalyn!

18:21.000 --> 18:24.120
Who? Sarah Le Pippalyn.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.800
She was laid by 5,000 men.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.640
Show me that?

18:30.160 --> 18:34.640
Mammy, that's SAHARA PIPELINE!

18:40.600 --> 18:43.920
Mammy, what the hell happened
here with Mrs Nicholson?

18:43.920 --> 18:46.320
Nothing. She seemed fine when
she was leaving here! What's up?

18:46.320 --> 18:50.280
Maria's mother! She's now talking
about having the wedding in Italy.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.480
We couldn't afford to go
to the Italy for a wedding!

18:53.480 --> 18:56.120
That's the point. She doesn't
want the Browns there.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.800
You've made things worse! Look.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.880
Don't you be worrying, son.

19:00.880 --> 19:05.200
She'll come round, once she
calms down. Everything will work
out how it was supposed to.

19:05.200 --> 19:09.800
It always does!
And Mark, Betty called here
the other day looking for you.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.800
Did she? You should talk to her.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.920
Ma, just leave it, will you?
No, I just won't leave it.
What's going on?

19:15.920 --> 19:18.560
I don't want to talk about it!
Fine.

19:20.080 --> 19:24.320
Fine. Well, if a man can't
talk to his own mother!

19:25.600 --> 19:26.600
Yes?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.160
I was offered a promotion in work.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.600
A promotion? A promotion to what?

19:33.600 --> 19:35.760
Supervisor. Ah.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.440
Not an ordinary visor!

19:41.080 --> 19:44.040
"Mark Brown: Supervisor"!
I turned it down.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.800
"Turned it down..."
You feckin' turned it down?!

19:46.800 --> 19:51.040
Well, what did Betty say about that?
That's the thing. I didn't tell her
before I turned it down.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.440
For God's sake, Mark.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.720
No wonder she's fighting with you!
You can't do that, son.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.400
You're a married man.
It's not all just about you now.

19:59.400 --> 20:03.160
It's a team. You have to t...

20:04.880 --> 20:07.200
Can I help you?

20:07.280 --> 20:09.800
Well, mind your own business!

20:12.160 --> 20:13.920
We'll talk later.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.440
You and me. Talk later!

20:19.960 --> 20:22.800
Walls. Fuckin' ears!

20:24.200 --> 20:25.520
So then, Rory.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.520
Decided to stay on your tools?

20:28.520 --> 20:29.600
Rory?

20:29.600 --> 20:32.600
Rory? I don't think his name
is Rory!

20:32.600 --> 20:37.920
Him Mark. Me Agnes. You Dermot.

20:37.920 --> 20:42.480
Not Rory. Would you like
another go at it, son?

20:42.480 --> 20:44.560
MIMICS TAPE REWINDING

20:46.640 --> 20:48.000
APPLAUSE

20:48.000 --> 20:51.840
So then, Mark. Decided
to stay with your tools?

20:51.840 --> 20:56.080
Yeah!
CLAPPING

20:59.680 --> 21:04.560
Mark the chippy,
always one of the lads!

21:04.560 --> 21:06.080
At least I'm not a thief.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.080
You're the brightest in the whole
family. You could be anything!

21:09.080 --> 21:11.520
Brighter than you?
I can't read, Dermot.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.400
And I can't write.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.520
That's why I turned down the
promotion - PAPER work!

21:17.520 --> 21:18.320
Does Betty know?

21:18.320 --> 21:21.360
No. How could she NOT know?
Because you hide it, Dermot.

21:21.360 --> 21:26.680
I can read me name, or the labels on
things I use a lot, but paperwork?

21:26.680 --> 21:28.200
No way!

21:30.680 --> 21:34.240
Betty? What's up? Is Bono all right?
Well, look who it is.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.360
What's wrong - no date tonight?

21:36.360 --> 21:38.960
Bono's fine.
except that he's missing his father.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.120
Tell him about the man you
were with in Foley's last night!

21:41.120 --> 21:46.240
He's a teacher! Yeah,
what's he teach? The Kama Sutra?

21:46.240 --> 21:48.280
Ma, shut up!

21:48.280 --> 21:50.600
What were you doing with a teacher?

21:50.600 --> 21:54.280
He's looking for a part-time cleaner,
and I've taken the job

21:54.280 --> 21:56.560
and in return he's going to
teach YOU to read and write!

21:56.560 --> 21:58.600
Read and write? You knew?

21:58.600 --> 22:01.360
Of course I knew! Knew what?

22:01.360 --> 22:04.280
Now come on Mark, come home.

22:04.280 --> 22:08.000
Please.
See ya, Ma! What did she know?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.760
Know what?

22:10.760 --> 22:13.320
Dermot, what did she know?

22:13.320 --> 22:16.040
I'll see you, Ma.
I'm going for a smoke.

22:24.640 --> 22:28.200
Well, I'm glad
I sorted all that out.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.720
SHE SOBS

22:36.120 --> 22:39.280
Mammy? You're very early.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.040
I've a fucking whole line to do!
Of course you do!

22:48.600 --> 22:50.120
SHE SOBS

23:00.000 --> 23:01.280
Wah-ha-ha!

23:04.800 --> 23:10.240
Once, that's all I ask - just once
I'd like us to be fuckin' normal!

23:14.160 --> 23:15.680
Mammy? Hello, son!

23:18.560 --> 23:20.080
Is everything all right? No.

23:20.080 --> 23:23.560
I've made a balls of the
whole lot. No, you haven't.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.040
YES I HAVE!

23:25.040 --> 23:28.720
Trevor is gone on the missions
because he can't get
far enough away from me.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.720
I've ruined Dermot's wedding.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.240
I don't know
what's wrong with Rory.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.480
He says I won't listen to him.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.840
Mammy! Not now, Rory,
for fuck's sake!

23:40.080 --> 23:42.680
And you.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.400
I never gave you a chance
after your divorce, did I?

23:45.400 --> 23:48.480
And he was beating you, wasn't he?

23:48.840 --> 23:54.200
And you know, Cathy, when your
father died I was so busy just
trying to keep it all together,

23:54.200 --> 23:58.120
that I never even bothered
to make sure Mark could
read and write.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.480
I'm a gobshite!

24:04.840 --> 24:06.400
Yeah. You are.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.080
I beg your fuckin' pardon?

24:09.080 --> 24:12.440
You're a gobshite, Mammy, because
you can't see what you HAVE done!

24:12.440 --> 24:15.000
Now don't plamause me!

24:15.000 --> 24:19.440
Mark left school when he was 12, sure
enough, but he was there
for eight years

24:19.440 --> 24:23.160
and he never missed a
single day! Not one day!

24:23.160 --> 24:27.800
Now, if a school can't teach a child
to read and write in eight years,

24:27.800 --> 24:31.400
well, that's the teachers' fault,
Mammy. It's not yours.

24:32.440 --> 24:33.720
The bastards!

24:40.480 --> 24:42.520
Mammy. What?

24:42.520 --> 24:46.520
Trevor is on the missions,
because he has a kind heart,

24:46.520 --> 24:48.880
which he got from you.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.680
Rory knows what he
wants to tell you.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.000
He's just afraid of hurting you.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.640
Don't be ridiculous.
Rory couldn't hurt me.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.200
He's one of my boys!

25:03.720 --> 25:07.040
And me, Mammy. Go on.

25:07.040 --> 25:12.560
Mammy, I'm just like you! If you
don't like something - change it.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.520
You taught me that.

25:20.240 --> 25:24.080
So you see, Mammy.
you did a good job. Dermot! What?

25:24.080 --> 25:27.120
Dermot, you forgot all about Dermot.
I didn't forget him.
You forgot Dermot!

25:27.120 --> 25:32.480
I did not forget him, Mammy.
I just couldn't think of
anything nice to say about him.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.680
LAUGHTER

25:36.480 --> 25:39.080
Well, go on.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.080
You tell me something nice
about Dermot.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.760
Well?

25:46.560 --> 25:48.360
He makes me laugh!

25:50.280 --> 25:57.640
I know it's not a big thing
but Jesus Christ,
he always makes me laugh!

25:59.280 --> 26:01.360
Come here, Mammy!

26:01.360 --> 26:04.440
Oh, don't start that shit now!

26:07.120 --> 26:09.680
I'm going to have to feckin'
toughen you up!

26:11.880 --> 26:13.760
Cathy!

26:13.760 --> 26:15.600
I'd be lost without you.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.440
This last couple of days.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.840
Goodnight, Mammy!

26:27.240 --> 26:30.480
Wait a minute. I haven't
got fuckin' Venetian blinds.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.760
DOORBELL RINGS

26:41.280 --> 26:44.880
Oh, Hillary,
thanks very much for coming over!

26:44.880 --> 26:47.000
Ah, I didn't say come in.

26:48.520 --> 26:53.120
I just wanted you to know that
I think your choice of the Ritz
Crown Hotel is a wonderful choice.

26:53.120 --> 26:57.200
Well, actually, we are thinking
of moving it to Italy.

26:57.200 --> 27:02.000
Yes, whatever happened to the church
fund the year your father
was in charge of it?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.560
Did they ever find out?

27:04.560 --> 27:09.280
I always liked the Ritz Crown Hotel.
Me too!

27:09.280 --> 27:12.080
You take care now. Arrivederci!

27:14.680 --> 27:16.480
APPLAUSE

27:17.640 --> 27:20.840
Everyone has their little secret.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.400
Cathy and her SECRET boyfriend.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.680
And imagine Mark
keeping that secret all those years.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.320
That's not right.

27:29.320 --> 27:32.240
Oh, there's some secrets
it's all right to keep, like.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.360
Your age, or your weight.

27:34.360 --> 27:37.120
Or whether or not someone
has a scar on their willy.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.840
But not Mark's secret. no.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.240
Or the recipe for brown bread.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.080
I must tell you some time!

27:49.600 --> 27:51.640
Goodbye! Come on, Grandad!
