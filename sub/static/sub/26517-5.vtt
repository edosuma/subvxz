Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.003 --> 00:05.657
I've had the best time hanging
out with the both of you.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.920
I think it's official
that we're a squad.
Totally.

00:07.964 --> 00:09.574
REBECCA:
When we stick together,
I'm pretty convinced

00:09.618 --> 00:10.749
there's nothing we can't do.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.099
I love you guys.
I really do.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.535
You can talk to me, D-Money.

00:13.578 --> 00:14.840
It's about me
and White Josh,

00:14.884 --> 00:16.364
and you're so obsessed
with us, and...

00:16.407 --> 00:19.149
O... M... G... What?!

00:19.193 --> 00:21.195
You guys are my #goals.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.761
I literally cannot
with you guys.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.633
You give me all the feels.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.243
What are you doing here?

00:26.287 --> 00:27.897
Heather texted me,
and she asked me to come.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.073
I wanted to see my friend.Friends?

00:30.117 --> 00:32.249
I thought you
didn't want to be.I thought youdidn't want to be.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.860
Do you think I'm a bad mom?You're not the most
attentive parent.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.384
Brendan's my weed guy.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.820
PAULA:
I thought you guys were just

00:37.863 --> 00:39.561
dead weight
slowing down the minivan.

00:39.604 --> 00:40.997
But I was wrong.

my newest stroke of genius,

01:26.434 --> 01:28.218
the reason
I assembled you all here

01:28.262 --> 01:30.612
for this #GirlGroupHangout.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.222
Pretzel pairings with wine!

01:32.266 --> 01:33.571
Ooh!

01:33.615 --> 01:34.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh!

01:34.833 --> 01:36.313
Okay, so we have
a Parmesan and pinot.

01:36.357 --> 01:37.314
Ooh!Ooh!

01:37.358 --> 01:39.447
A Roquefort and Riesling.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.145
Oh, wait. No, that's for you.
That's for you. Uh-huh.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.278
And my personal favorite--

01:44.321 --> 01:46.584
Manchego and merlot.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.977
Ooh.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.979
Oh, look at you,
Miss Entrepreneur.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.546
You are glowing.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.374
Yeah, I'm really happy lately.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.940
I really love this job,

01:54.984 --> 01:57.073
and Dr. Akopian says
I'm doing well,

01:57.117 --> 01:59.554
and volunteering at the jail
is going great.

01:59.597 --> 02:03.166
I just feel really grounded
and centered, you know?

02:03.210 --> 02:05.951
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
no, no, no, no.

02:05.995 --> 02:08.171
It's sip and nibble,
sip and nibble.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.260
What's that look for?

02:10.304 --> 02:12.480
Oh, Heather,
are you getting divorced?

02:12.523 --> 02:14.656
Oof, I'm sorry.
We all saw it coming.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.005
What? No.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.572
You did? No.

02:17.615 --> 02:20.183
Um, I have news.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.358
Is it that you're getting us
a new vibrator?

02:21.402 --> 02:23.055
'Cause the old one's
on its last legs.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.101
You don't still
use my vibrator.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.233
No, I do not.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.582
Uh, I'm just gonna say it.

02:27.625 --> 02:31.325
So, um, Hector and I bought
a condo in El Segundo.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.413
So,

02:32.456 --> 02:34.284
we're moving.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.331
Oh.Yeah.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.115
He got this great job
at a surf camp down there,

02:39.159 --> 02:41.422
and I've always wanted
to live at the beach, so...

02:41.465 --> 02:43.772
Wow.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.252
Wow, wow,

02:45.295 --> 02:47.210
wow. This is
really big

02:47.254 --> 02:49.081
and an adult step.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.388
I mean, you're married.
Now you're buying real estate.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.303
It's huge. Right, Paula?

02:53.347 --> 02:54.826
That's kind of crazy,
right, Valencia?

02:54.870 --> 02:56.654
I'm moving
to New York.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.439
Yeah, okay. That's funny.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.180
Beth and I got
an offer to work

03:00.223 --> 03:01.746
at a huge party planning
company.

03:01.790 --> 03:05.446
We rented a tiny apartment
the size of my current closet,

03:05.489 --> 03:06.969
but it's the Big Apple.

03:07.012 --> 03:09.101
Big Apple, small apartment.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.103
Wait, both of you are moving?

03:11.147 --> 03:12.888
At the same time?

03:12.931 --> 03:14.237
Okay.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.630
Wow. Um,

03:15.673 --> 03:17.545
I, uh-- I don't
know what to say.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.678
Wow. You guys have
a lot of stuff figured out.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.027
Valencia
and Heather

03:22.071 --> 03:23.420
and Pa-- I mean, Paula,
let's not forget you.

03:23.464 --> 03:24.900
You're about to graduate
from law school.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.423
It's amazing
for all of you.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.034
Mazel, mazel!
Mazel to all!

03:29.078 --> 03:31.515
We've been trying to decide
how to break it to you,

03:31.559 --> 03:34.692
but, really, it's not
such a big deal. I mean,No.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.260
Heather's basically
just moving across town.Yeah.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.827
I'm still gonna be working
for Home Base.Mm-hmm.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.089
The El Segundo Home Base

03:40.132 --> 03:42.134
was already one
of my Home Bases.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.962
Now it'll just be my
home base Home Base,

03:44.006 --> 03:46.443
and the West Covina Home Base
will be my second base.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.097
Or segundobase.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.359
: Segundo
base.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.579
Yeah, we can all text
and talk on the phone

03:51.622 --> 03:52.841
and FaceTime.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.190
Plus, I'm coming home
for the holidays.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.583
I already booked my ticket.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.411
Oh, my God.

03:57.454 --> 04:01.458
PAULA: Okay, Cookie, I can see
this is difficult for you.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.460
Scott and I lived
in three other crappy suburbs

04:03.504 --> 04:05.810
before we lived
in this crappy suburb.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.683
And... I've said good-bye
to a lot of people.

04:08.726 --> 04:11.338
And you get used
to it.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.514
You say hello, you say good-bye,

04:13.557 --> 04:16.865
and you just try to treasure
the moments in between.

04:16.908 --> 04:18.823
Yeah. Yes, you're right.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.521
That's what I'm doing right now.
I am treasuring

04:20.564 --> 04:22.523
and savoring.
I mean, you know,

04:22.566 --> 04:23.611
it's a little hard for me.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.352
It kind of feels like I'm...

04:25.395 --> 04:26.788
losing two friends at once.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.659
But I will be

04:28.703 --> 04:32.707
cheering you all on
very sincerely from...

04:32.750 --> 04:35.231
my small, unprofitable
pretzel store,

04:35.275 --> 04:37.320
with my no boyfriend,
having not had sex

04:37.364 --> 04:38.713
since before the slammer,
because-- oh, right--

04:38.756 --> 04:40.367
I was also in jail.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.460
PAULA:
You should've seen the look

04:46.503 --> 04:48.549
on Rebecca's face.
I felt so bad for her.

04:48.592 --> 04:51.900
It was like when you dropped
your cotton candy in the potty

04:51.943 --> 04:53.336
and you were so sad.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.643
Right. But then I-I picked it
back up and I ate it.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.517
Um, speaking of big news,

05:00.561 --> 05:02.084
I have some.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.478
You gonna stop calling Tommy
"General Buttface Jackson"?

05:04.521 --> 05:06.131
Uh, he loves that. No.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.437
You are finally going to...

05:07.481 --> 05:09.439
You ever heard of,
uh, Peeps for Peace?

05:09.483 --> 05:12.442
Sure. Yeah, they're-they're
kind of like the Peace Corps.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.052
What about 'em?
Did you...

05:14.096 --> 05:15.706
read an article about
'em or something?

05:15.750 --> 05:19.493
No, no, no.
I-I applied and got in.

05:19.536 --> 05:22.147
I'm just waiting
on my assignment.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.497
I'm excited to see
where I get to go.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.150
Might be pretty far.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.153
What, like... Denver?

05:28.197 --> 05:29.764
No, no,
like, uh...

05:29.807 --> 05:33.115
like South America or Africa.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.382
I just, you know, thought
we were in a phase

05:39.426 --> 05:40.862
of telling each other
stuff...

05:40.905 --> 05:42.603
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I just...

05:42.646 --> 05:43.952
I thought... I thought
you might be upset, so...

05:43.995 --> 05:46.128
Why would I be upset?

05:46.171 --> 05:48.609
Be-Because we just
kind of got close,

05:48.652 --> 05:50.437
and now I'm-I'm leaving.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.178
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

05:53.222 --> 05:55.355
No. I'm happy for you.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.530
I'm happy for me.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.531
Yeah?
Yeah.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.489
I've got a kid

05:59.533 --> 06:01.578
who's-who's gonna go
super far away

06:01.622 --> 06:04.320
and make a big-ass difference
on this planet

06:04.364 --> 06:05.582
for...

06:05.626 --> 06:07.410
how long?
Uh,

06:07.454 --> 06:10.500
anywhere between five
and ten years.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.547
Good.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.419
Good.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.029
Good.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.031
By the way,

06:20.075 --> 06:21.772
don't tell your dad
about this pie,

06:21.816 --> 06:24.384
because he is an
emotional eater.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.515
I can see you're upset.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.951
I'm not upset. Not at all.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.953
I am proud.
This is... this is...

06:28.997 --> 06:31.391
this is an achievement.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.958
I mean, any mother
would be proud.
Right.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.308
Like I... like I always say,

06:36.352 --> 06:38.441
you say hello,

06:38.485 --> 06:40.617
you say good-bye,

06:40.661 --> 06:42.532
and you just try to...

06:42.576 --> 06:45.970
treasure the m...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.412
Just...

06:57.939 --> 07:00.637
I can't go back from paternity
leave until I binge this show.

07:00.681 --> 07:02.726
Everyone has seen it,
and they've already said

07:02.770 --> 07:04.075
they're gonna spoil
everything for me.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.555
Hector loves this show.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.817
What is it about again?

07:06.861 --> 07:08.819
It's a British cop thing

07:08.863 --> 07:10.821
with a child murder
in a fishing village.Ooh.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.562
Okay.
Yeah. And it stars

07:12.606 --> 07:15.609
that Swedish actress
and that Scottish guy.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.959
Okay.And some episodes
are two hours

07:18.002 --> 07:20.701
and some are 30 minutes.Wow. All right.
Sounds good.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.224
Let's binge it up.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.574
All righty.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.229
♪ Hey, it's not weird we spend
so much time together,

07:27.272 --> 07:29.449
is it?No. Besides,

07:29.492 --> 07:31.015
that murder's
not gonna solve itself.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.497
You do realize we don't
solve the murder, right?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.804
Oh, come on.
Have some fun.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.764
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.592
It's a normal reaction.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.813
Your roommate's moving out,
your friend's moving away.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.250
Of course
you're feeling low and sad.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.644
No, it's not that.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.602
Can I tell you something?

07:52.646 --> 07:54.082
Okay.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.953
What I'm about to say
is-is horrible.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.999
It's all right.

07:59.827 --> 08:04.179
: I see life as
a contest, and I'm now losing.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.529
What? R-Rebecca,
I-I didn't hear you.

08:06.573 --> 08:07.878
:
I feel less than

08:07.922 --> 08:10.402
when others are doing
better than me.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.883
Okay. I'll come sit next to you.

08:14.842 --> 08:15.799
:
Okay.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.627
I want
to cryogenically freeze

08:17.671 --> 08:19.586
all my friends
to buy me some time

08:19.629 --> 08:21.849
to find a better career
and a life partner.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.590
And then, when I'm ready,
I'll wake them up,

08:23.633 --> 08:26.549
and I'll throw a party for all
of our mutual milestones.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.638
That is so messed up.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.292
Aw!
I'm kidding.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.860
Feeling competitive
is just human nature.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.644
It's normal.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.863
Is it?
Yes.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.952
And it makes
sense that you

08:37.995 --> 08:40.258
would feel... behind.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.825
You are,
in a sense,

08:41.869 --> 08:43.131
a little behind.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.568
Um, wait, what?

08:45.612 --> 08:46.743
You have overcome

08:46.787 --> 08:49.746
challenges other people
haven't faced,

08:49.790 --> 08:54.751
and you have wisely taken
the time to do the hard work.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.058
It makes sense that
some of your friends

08:57.101 --> 09:00.844
might hit some early adult
milestones before you.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.107
Oh.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.109
No, it's funny,
'cause I was saying I was behind

09:05.153 --> 09:07.590
so you would say, "No, no, no,
you're not behind."

09:07.634 --> 09:09.592
But you said that I am.
It's fine. No, it's just--

09:09.636 --> 09:11.159
It's slightly jarring
when a medical professional

09:11.202 --> 09:14.075
confirms your worst fears,
but that makes sense.

09:14.118 --> 09:17.774
My friends are,
in some senses...

09:17.818 --> 09:20.603
at a more advanced stage
in their lives.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.648
Exactly.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.085
So...

09:24.128 --> 09:25.869
maybe what I need to do

09:25.913 --> 09:27.088
is hang out
with some different people

09:27.131 --> 09:29.046
who are more where I'm at.Rebecca,

09:29.090 --> 09:31.788
I am not suggesting that
you replace your friends.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.398
No, no, no, no. I wouldn't
do that. I mean, that's--

09:33.442 --> 09:35.531
I'm not saying that I would do
that. That's not what I'm doing.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.663
I'm just adding
to my friend group

09:36.706 --> 09:38.621
with people
who don't scare me.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.276
REBECCA:
So...

09:41.319 --> 09:42.756
Maya, AJ,
I've brought you both here

09:42.799 --> 09:44.845
to ask you
a very important question.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.718
Have either of you considered
owning a condo?

10:00.991 --> 10:02.166
Oh...

10:02.210 --> 10:03.385
What's going on in here?
What are you doing?

10:03.428 --> 10:05.648
Brendan doesn't sell
drugs anymore.

10:05.692 --> 10:09.260
Which is kind of a bummer,
'cause he was my weed guy.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.218
Scott, we have an emergency.

10:10.261 --> 10:12.046
Our son is going far away.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.264
Super far.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.875
And we're so proud of him.

10:14.918 --> 10:17.660
Screw proud.
I just started liking that kid.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.271
I need to find something
to make him stay.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.014
Oh. Oh.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.668
A yearbook page.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.062
I think I may have just found
the mother lode.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.369
Vanessa Rodriguez.

10:31.413 --> 10:32.675
Oh, yeah.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.677
I remember her. He
really liked her.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.898
I remember her, too.
I used to think she was his OTP.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.464
His over the pants?

10:39.508 --> 10:42.250
One true pairing. Oh, God.

10:42.293 --> 10:45.122
This is great. This is just
the ammunition I need.

10:45.166 --> 10:48.125
Babe, I'm begging you,
do not interfere in his life.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.824
He's made a good decision
for once. Let him be.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.696
You're right. I... I
shouldn't interfere.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.786
I-I learned that lesson
a million times.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.483
I'm just gonna let him

10:58.527 --> 11:01.399
fly away and...

11:01.443 --> 11:03.837
be free.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.882
Exactly.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.405
Glad you understand.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.669
I do.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.327
:
Fly free, my ass.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.071
DARRYL: Ah, it's
nice to be out

11:21.115 --> 11:22.464
on the first cool
day of the year.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.422
WHITE JOSH:
Yep, only 85 degrees.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.902
It's a very simple question.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.992
Have you considered
owning a condo?

11:29.036 --> 11:31.778
Oh, no way. I'm not even sure
what a condo is.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.999
Is that Rebecca?

11:36.043 --> 11:38.610
Wait. Back it up.
Back the car up.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.916
Hit a lamppost.
Call your mother.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.440
You're getting towed.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.574
Are Darryl and White Josh
back together? Yay!

11:45.617 --> 11:48.229
WhiteJoshfeather is my OTP.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.666
That means one true pairing.No, I know what it is

11:50.710 --> 11:52.059
'cause I'm-I'm super young,
as well.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.408
Um, and no, I don't think

11:53.451 --> 11:54.539
they are back together.Huh?

11:54.583 --> 11:56.237
But let's get
back to me.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.760
AJ: Rebecca,
hold on.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.154
Are you telling me
that adorable family

12:00.197 --> 12:02.939
that I'm about to Pinterest
all over my Life Goals board

12:02.983 --> 12:04.549
is not a couple?

12:04.593 --> 12:07.248
Yeah. They're not
back together.

12:08.858 --> 12:12.253
MAYA: It's so sad. Look
at them, they're so cute.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.821
Aw.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.692
Something like thisLike this?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.346
Darryl says
they're just friends,

12:18.389 --> 12:20.217
but nobody spends
that much time together

12:20.261 --> 12:21.915
if they're not hooking up.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.397
Just look at those two.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.315
Just get back together!

12:31.359 --> 12:33.404
Everyone wants you
back together. Come on!

12:33.448 --> 12:35.798
What?MAYA: Yeah!
Stop pretending

12:35.842 --> 12:37.669
you guys aren't in love!

12:37.713 --> 12:40.324
Why is everyone yelling at us?I don't know.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.414
Mm-mm. Not okay.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.286
Let's go.All right.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.853
Mm-mm.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.377
Happy birthday, Connor.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.944
Oh, boy. They're on the move.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.597
Why are they coming over here?Oh, my goodness.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.948
I don't know.MAYA: We've all
had enough of this.

12:54.991 --> 12:58.081
Okay, okay.
hat's going on?

12:58.125 --> 13:01.606
Come on, you two. Your
relationship is important to us.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.694
Just give in,

13:02.738 --> 13:05.610
and get in the spirit!Yeah.

doing here?

back together, too!

15:06.340 --> 15:08.820
and I've had a really hard week,
so please, let me have this.

at all anymore.

for Hawaiian shirt day

What a dork.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.768
He's the best trainer
at the gym besides you.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.771
He doesn't grunt. Always puts
the weights down lightly.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.252
Always lets me quit.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.124
I think

17:18.167 --> 17:19.821
if he was 20 years older,
he'd be perfect for you.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.997
Yeah, he might be perfect for me
right now.

YeahYeah.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.958
Yeah, yeah. At some point.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.656
I just got so much
going on right now.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.875
Speaking of which, can I drop by
tonight and do my laundry?

17:30.919 --> 17:32.268
The, uh, machines at my building

17:32.312 --> 17:33.791
are a little less free
than yours.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.271
Sure.While I'm there,

17:35.315 --> 17:36.577
maybe we can watch
that new series

17:36.620 --> 17:37.926
about toxic waste and cancer.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.884
Oh, yeah, the one
that won Best Comedy.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.583

17:42.626 --> 17:45.499

17:45.542 --> 17:47.675
REBECCA: So, what do you think
of my wine pairing?

17:47.718 --> 17:50.982
You know, I'm not that into
blue and Bordeaux,

17:51.026 --> 17:53.768
but that's just 'cause to me,
blue smells like blarf.

17:53.811 --> 17:56.771
That's such a funny
young person thing you just did.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.817
Combining two words to make
a new word. It's so great.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.691
Hmm? One second.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.693
Hmm.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.348
Oh, my roommate Heather
sent out an Evite.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.089
Heather and Valencia are having

18:10.132 --> 18:13.353
a farewell party at my house
on Saturday night.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.745
That's funny.
I wasn't consulted.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.878
Mm.They probably thought
I'd be upset,

18:16.921 --> 18:18.445
but you know what? I don't care.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.708
I don't care. It's fine.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.406
Hey, it says bring whomever.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.321
You guys want to come

18:25.365 --> 18:26.540
That's when I do

18:26.583 --> 18:28.019
my evening intention
hikes with the friends

18:28.063 --> 18:30.544
from my intramural
three-legged race team.

18:30.587 --> 18:33.416
Maya, you in, girl?

18:33.460 --> 18:35.679
Girl, okay, normally I got you,

18:35.723 --> 18:38.378
but I have my ironic
scrapbooking group Saturday.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.684
Oh.
Yeah, this week
we're collaging

18:40.728 --> 18:42.730
with sexist shampoo ads
from the '70s.

18:42.773 --> 18:45.298
Feminism.
Yes.

18:45.341 --> 18:49.302
Why don't you bring all
your friends to my house party?

18:49.345 --> 18:51.608
Are you sure? It's,
like, ten people.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.350
Mine would be, like, 12.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.309
Bring whoever you want.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.137
It is a party.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.227
My therapist said...

19:01.270 --> 19:03.098
Just bring-bring your friends.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.100
The more the merrier.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.189
:
Okay.
Cool.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.938
WOMAN:
Thank you.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.723
Thank you so much. Enjoy.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.161
Have a nice day. Wow.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.250
These are adorable.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.515
This pair says "hell"
and "no." That's great.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.734
Oh, look at these.
"Boy" and "bye."

19:30.778 --> 19:31.996
Mm-hmm.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.217
Wait, Vanessa Rodriguez?
Is that you?

19:35.261 --> 19:37.828
Yeah. Can I help you?

19:37.872 --> 19:39.700
I'm Brendan Proctor's mom.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.180
Oh, hi.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.182
Hey, listen,
do you have a second

19:43.225 --> 19:45.793
to talk about your OTP?

20:00.851 --> 20:03.898
What are you guys doing?HEATHER:
Well, again,

20:03.941 --> 20:05.813
I'm moving,
so I'm packing up my stuff.

20:05.856 --> 20:06.988
I'm picking up some
stuff I left here

20:07.031 --> 20:08.729
that I'm taking to New York.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.819
Right, got it. I mean,
that is my skillet, though.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.429
Okay, it's not a skillet.
It's a stock pot.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.996
And it has
my mother's name on it.

20:15.039 --> 20:18.217
Okay, point taken.
Your mom puts her name on pots,

20:18.260 --> 20:19.914
which is what you'll
probably be doing soon

20:19.957 --> 20:22.395
since you're
basically mom age now.

20:22.438 --> 20:23.831
You and I are the same age.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.528
Yeah, and I'm younger.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.704
Rebecca, you're being weird.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.837
I'm being...
I'm sorry, what did you...?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.404
I don't even recognize
that word anymore,

20:31.447 --> 20:34.145
'cause the word is not "weird."
It's actually "fizzy" now.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.495
I'm sorry, what?

20:35.538 --> 20:36.844
That's what
my young new friends say.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.933
What new friends?Oh, you wouldn't know them.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.500
They're these kids
Maya and AJ.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.198
I know Maya and AJ.So do I.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.505
Okay, well, that's cool.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.855
So you know how, like, young
and cool and fizzy they are.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.031
Your new friends are weird?

20:50.074 --> 20:51.815
Oh, my God. Centenarian.

20:51.859 --> 20:54.470
Fizzy is a word that
means multiple things.

20:54.514 --> 20:55.993
It's like "sick" or "bad"

20:56.037 --> 20:58.169
or "aloha" or "shalom."

20:58.213 --> 21:00.911
Uh, look, girl,
I know this is hard.

21:00.955 --> 21:03.827
Yeah, and kind of triggering.Okay.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.787
I... I appreciate
you guys worrying about me,

21:06.830 --> 21:08.963
but, you know,

21:09.006 --> 21:11.487
to play armchair psychiatrist
for a second,

21:11.531 --> 21:13.837
I think you're fixating
a little bit too much on me

21:13.881 --> 21:15.491
rather than focus
on your own sadness.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.058
You guys are
saying good-bye

21:17.101 --> 21:19.147
to the young and fizzy
parts of your lives--

21:19.190 --> 21:21.105
good fizzy, not bad fizzy--
and you're thinking,

21:21.149 --> 21:23.891
"Okay, now that I'm old and
boring, will life be as fun?"

21:23.934 --> 21:26.894
And the answer is likely no.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.809
But the good news is

21:28.852 --> 21:30.985
you can live through
your fun friend, Becks,

21:31.028 --> 21:32.856
and you can follow me
on my Insta or my Finsta,

21:32.900 --> 21:33.988
if I let you.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.337
It's a lot of
secret pictures

21:35.381 --> 21:36.599
of me doing all
of the drugs.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.209
Anyway, I got to go
to a pop-up candy museum

21:38.253 --> 21:39.907
and then a hookah bar and then
a party inside a photo booth.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.256
So got to dip.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.692
Oh, I'm sorry. "Dip"
means "bounce,"

21:42.736 --> 21:43.867
which means "peace out."

21:43.911 --> 21:45.869
Which means "leave."

21:47.088 --> 21:49.699
She's being ridiculous.
We're not old.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.833
Not at all.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.835
Where is my back brace, though?

21:54.878 --> 21:57.185
'Cause I have to lift
this dish box.

21:57.228 --> 22:00.231
Oh. Wonder who that is.

22:05.019 --> 22:07.456
Oh, my God.Hi.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.153
This is the girl

22:09.197 --> 22:11.547
that I bought earrings from
earlier today.Hi.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.419
Oh, thank you so much
for coming by to drop them off.

22:13.462 --> 22:14.898
I really appreciate it.Of course.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.291
Hey, no, c-come in, come in.Okay.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.685
Vanessa Rodriguez is here.Shh.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.078
Honey, don't be rude.Uh, yes, Paula,

22:21.122 --> 22:22.950
here are your custom earrings
that say "lawyer" and "bitch."

22:22.993 --> 22:24.125
Ooh!

22:25.431 --> 22:27.215
Brendan?

22:27.258 --> 22:28.782
Is this your mom?Yeah.

22:28.825 --> 22:29.826
Yeah, yeah, that's, uh,

22:29.870 --> 22:31.132
that's my mom, that's my dad,

22:31.175 --> 22:32.916
and th-that's
General Buttface Jackson.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.701
At your service.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.920
:
Well, what a funny coincidence

22:36.964 --> 22:38.487
that your mom, who
I've never met before,

22:38.531 --> 22:41.229
bought earrings from my kiosk
today. That's so weird.

22:41.272 --> 22:44.014
God, V, I-I haven't seen you
in a while.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.016
You look... you look amazing.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.627
Well, you look pretty
good, yourself.

22:47.670 --> 22:48.932
Thank you.

22:48.976 --> 22:53.110
Listen, um, we have
a lot of meat loaf left over

22:53.154 --> 22:55.112
because Tommy's
weirdly vegetarian now.Oh.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.419
Will you join us?Well, I don't want to impose.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.812
No, no, no, you're not imposing.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.161
No. Get up, buddy.Tommy, take your plate.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.249
Get up.Just find another chair.
Come on. Okay.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.381
You're just gonna sit
right here.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.905
Okay. Thank you.Thank you.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.123
PAULA: Just sit
right next to Brendan.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.692
SCOTT:
What the hell are you doing?

23:09.736 --> 23:11.302
PAULA:
Shh!

23:11.346 --> 23:13.522
Not so loud.
The boys will hear you.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.524
What do you think
I'm doing?

23:15.568 --> 23:16.917
I'm trying to get Vanessa
and Brendan back together

23:16.960 --> 23:19.006
so he won't leave.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.224
Look, I did not
offer her money

23:20.268 --> 23:23.053
or blackmail her.
I am just playing Cupid.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.707
That's nothing.

23:24.751 --> 23:28.494
Look, I understand
this is hard for you.

23:28.537 --> 23:30.496
This is hard for me, too.
Our guy is...

23:30.539 --> 23:32.628
He's moving on.Shh.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.326
But we can't be messing
with his life.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.416
If you don't call this off,

23:37.459 --> 23:39.766
I will.Oh, you are not
calling off anything.

23:39.809 --> 23:43.117
You don't understand.
You're not Mom.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.988
He grew in my stomach.

23:45.032 --> 23:49.253
His first sentence was,
"Wuv you, Mama."

23:49.297 --> 23:51.952
For the first four years
of his life,

23:51.995 --> 23:54.737
we were stapled together
unless I was at work.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.565
And then from the ages
of four to 18, I lost him

23:56.609 --> 23:59.612
to his stupid friends and knives

23:59.655 --> 24:01.744
and girls he never told me about

24:01.788 --> 24:03.877
and masturbation
and selling pot,

24:03.920 --> 24:06.749
and now he's back,
and he likes me,

24:06.793 --> 24:09.926
and I wuv him more than ever.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.842
And I just... I don't want
to lose him yet, Scott. Please.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.975
Yeah, but I...
Scott.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.063
Please.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.069
WHITE JOSH:
You're up, man.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.374
Wow.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.376
Okay, okay, attention,
everybody at the bar?

24:25.420 --> 24:27.161
Vic here has another dart
to throw,

24:27.204 --> 24:29.598
and he's not afraid to
cause bodily harm, okay?

24:29.642 --> 24:31.600
Look out.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.168
This is it. This
is the big one.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.170
: Big money,
big money...

24:37.606 --> 24:39.216
Where did that one even go?

24:39.260 --> 24:41.218
Um...That is unbelievable.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.133
Okay, buddy.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.135
Wow, you are bad at that.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.181
Actually, I just need
a little bit of a warm-up.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.227
Hey, I didn't
get your RSVeep.
Hey.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.577
Are you coming by
tomorrow night?
Oh.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.492
Right, going-away party.
Shoot, sorry.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.189
Yeah. Um,
heads-up, actually.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.104
Uh, Rebecca's kind of
having a tough time

24:57.147 --> 24:58.322
with everyone leaving.

24:58.366 --> 24:59.541
Yeah, that makes sense.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.108
You guys are both moving.
That's hard.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.850
So true. So brutal.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.155
Trutal.
Trutal.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.243
You know,
I don't know you,

25:06.287 --> 25:08.115
but you can also come.Oh.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.247
Thank you.
Yeah.

25:10.291 --> 25:13.033
Who's TrutalAh.

25:13.076 --> 25:16.645
Trutal is no one. Uh, Rebecca
is someone she lives with.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.473
Heather, actually,
Heather's moving away.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.171
And, uh, she's married
to a friend of mine, Hector.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.433
And they have this other friend,

25:22.477 --> 25:24.087
Valencia,
who's also moving away.

25:24.131 --> 25:27.395
And, uh...
Yeah, this is boring, right?

25:27.438 --> 25:30.006
This is all people
you don't know.No, I'm interested.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.661
It's your life. We're getting
to know each other.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.272
So tell me about who is leaving.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.797
Where do I start? Um...

25:37.840 --> 25:39.015
Hmm.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.277
Okay.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.670
Sorry, that took forever.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.194
Oh, was it a bad date?Uh, mm, no.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.545
I like him. He just wanted to
know everything about my life.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.285
So many questions.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.071
Well, that-that sounds like
a normal first date. A good one.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.595
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.076
The whole time I was just
thinking about coming back here

25:56.119 --> 25:57.730
and kicking off my shoes

25:57.773 --> 25:59.688
and hanging out with somebody
who already knew all that stuff.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.347
Uh, what the hell was that?

26:09.263 --> 26:10.177
Get out.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.445
You have got to get out.What are you talking about?

26:17.488 --> 26:20.796
You're using our friendship
like a cocoon.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.146
I-It's like that sci-fi series
that we watched

26:23.190 --> 26:25.975
where the alien lived
in that waterproof chrysalis.

26:26.019 --> 26:28.499
I am not Gemini.
You take that back.Okay. Mm-mm.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.632
He destroyed an
entire continent

26:30.676 --> 26:33.374
because he was so afraid
of leaving his warm...

26:33.417 --> 26:35.419
comfortable cocoon.

26:35.463 --> 26:38.422
Okay, yeah, I'm hearing
that. I am hearing that now.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.424
Look, Joshua,
I love having you around,

26:40.468 --> 26:42.296
but people are right.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.298
We spend an awful lot
of time together,

26:44.341 --> 26:47.693
but we know it's not gonna be
anything more than a friendship.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.825
I mean, a really great
friendship, but...

26:49.869 --> 26:51.435
we don't want it to be the thing

26:51.479 --> 26:53.568
that keeps us
from meeting someone new.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.265
Either one of us.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.224
What about all our shows?

26:57.267 --> 26:59.052
Well, I could give you
the passwords.

26:59.095 --> 27:02.359
But it's the golden
age of television.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.666
I understand what I'm doing.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.016
All right.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.932
Now, Netflix...

27:09.976 --> 27:12.413
is "hebbybebbynetflix."

27:12.456 --> 27:13.675
Hebbybebbynetflix.

27:13.719 --> 27:18.158
HBO Go is "hebbybebbyhbo."Mm-hmm. Oh, okay.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.986
Hulu is... Hmm?No, I think I got it.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.205
Oh, okay. I mean,
if you think you got it.I think I got it.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.425
Yeah, you established a
pretty clear pattern there.

27:24.468 --> 27:27.036
It's "hebbybebbyhulu."
I knew you wanted to know.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.908
PAULA:
This is just so great.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.562
It has been two days,

27:31.606 --> 27:34.478
and Vanessa and Brendan have
been out three times already.

27:34.522 --> 27:35.741
I know, it's been a minute

27:35.784 --> 27:37.220
since he went out with someone
that often.

27:37.264 --> 27:40.354
Yeah. The only bummer is
is if they get really serious,

27:40.397 --> 27:42.051
what will he do

27:42.095 --> 27:43.400
about Peeps for Peace?

27:43.444 --> 27:45.620
Long-distance is so hard.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.101
Ask The Notebook.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.364
Oh, hello, lovebirds.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.758
How was your date?

27:52.801 --> 27:54.368
Pretty good.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.674
Really?

27:55.717 --> 27:57.632
Yeah, she's pregnant.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.200
Awesome date.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.505
What? No. You just started...

28:01.549 --> 28:03.812
You can't...
but you can't know that quickly.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.858
I know. I ovulated yesterday,

28:05.901 --> 28:07.381
and I felt the
implantation today.

28:07.424 --> 28:08.556
What?
BRENDAN:
Yeah.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.732
So, obviously,
Peeps for Peace is out.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.691
I'll have to go back
to dealing drugs.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.389
Now that weed's legal,
guess I'll move on to oxy?

28:15.432 --> 28:16.433
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.478
You were... you were so excited

28:17.521 --> 28:18.566
about Peeps for Peace.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.090
And-and it was such
a noble decision,

28:21.134 --> 28:22.396
and-and I was so happy for you.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.180
And... Oh, my God.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.704
A spontaneous pregnancy?

28:25.747 --> 28:27.706
A

28:30.796 --> 28:32.754
Okay.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.800
You guys got me.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.497
You got me.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.107
Who was in on this?

28:38.151 --> 28:39.979
Right.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.503
The unprotected sex and drug
storylines were my idea.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.026
I see.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.376
He got it from the series
about the teenage death pact.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.335
Eight episodes. So sad.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.903
They had to have counselors come
to the middle school.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.600
Vanessa called me
after you went to see her.

28:52.643 --> 28:55.429
So I, uh, roped Dad in
and Buttface

28:55.472 --> 28:57.648
and hatched a plan.

28:57.692 --> 29:00.434
You got me.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.044
Mom, I know you love me.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.960
I love you, too,
but I got to go.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.440
I know.

29:06.483 --> 29:09.225
I was just...
trying to buy some time.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.749
I know.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.316
I mean, come on,
it was just, like, yesterday

29:13.360 --> 29:15.231
that you were
an itty-bitty baby.

29:15.275 --> 29:18.147
: And I could
hold all of you in one arm.

29:18.191 --> 29:19.496
Oh, Mom.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.150
:
Oh, my God.

29:21.194 --> 29:23.674
I'm crying again.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.894
I-I'm good, I'm good.
I'm so sorry.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.635
I just...

29:27.678 --> 29:29.811
Oh, God...
Oh, Mama.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.552
Don't... No, it's all good.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.515
Oh.They were all in on
it. Got me so good.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.344
I guess the olive doesn't
fall far from the tree.

29:41.388 --> 29:45.609
I don't know. Hey, this
going-away party is top-notch.

29:45.653 --> 29:48.438
It's classy. I mean, I gotta
talk to Hector's mom

29:48.482 --> 29:50.223
about doing a nice soiree
like this at our place.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.573
You've got to stop calling her
"Hector's mom."

29:52.616 --> 29:54.053
You got to move out
of her house.

29:54.096 --> 29:56.664
Enough. Se acabó.Basta.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.057
Well, you know
what you need to do?

29:58.100 --> 29:59.841
Stop playing this old people's
music. It's fizzy.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.364
Okay, now I'm freaking out,

30:01.408 --> 30:02.583
because I thought
she made that up.

30:02.626 --> 30:05.412
No, the kids
dosay fizzy.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.501
Rebecca's almost 30.
She's not a kid.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.633
REBECCA:
Hey!

30:09.677 --> 30:11.635
Yo, yo, yo.
Where the party at?

30:14.638 --> 30:15.726
Yeah. Oh,

30:15.770 --> 30:16.902
that's my friends.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.425
I told them to come
ironically early.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.471
Hey.
AJ:
Hey.

30:21.515 --> 30:23.299
How's it going? Hi.Oh, my God.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.388
REBECCA: Welcome. Oh, my God.AJ: Thank you.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.608
You are young. You are young.
You are a fetus.

30:27.651 --> 30:28.652
Hello. Welcome. Welcome.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.393
Hi.

30:30.437 --> 30:31.699
Do you know these people?

30:31.742 --> 30:33.092
No, of course I don't
know these people.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.484
Yeah.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.791
Anybody have a problem
with this?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.140
No? Okay, great.

30:39.359 --> 30:40.926
So Rebecca carried the baby...No, no, no.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.189
It was Heather who carried the
baby, but it was Rebecca's egg.

30:43.232 --> 30:45.017
Uh, okay, I'll get
it eventually.No, you're good.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.367
I mean, probably won't, so...Either way.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.064
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want something?Yeah, sure.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.849
Hey, Darryl.DARRYL:
Hmm?

30:50.892 --> 30:53.852
Hey, listen, I
heard what you did.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.115
And thank you for throwing water
in Josh's face.

30:56.158 --> 30:57.638
Oh.It really helped him

30:57.681 --> 30:59.205
get out of his kelp cocoon,
you know?

30:59.248 --> 31:02.469
Oh, my God.
You're watching Gemini's Escape.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.514
Yes.What episode are you on?
Have you gotten to the one

31:04.558 --> 31:06.777
with the...

31:06.821 --> 31:08.214
Blink twice if you know
what I'm saying.

31:08.257 --> 31:10.216
Oh!
I know.

31:10.259 --> 31:11.434
Let's get something to drink.Yeah.

31:11.478 --> 31:12.871
I think you need it.

31:12.914 --> 31:13.959
Should I turn it up?Yeah.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.134
Hey, uh, do you mind?

31:15.177 --> 31:17.179
I kind of, like,
curated a playlist.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.442
Can you, like, turn
it down at least?REBECCA: Hey.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.270
Or, like...Heather, Heather, hey.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.794
Um, oh, my God. You're kind
of embarrassing me right now.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.013
These are my guests,

31:25.057 --> 31:26.797
and they can do whatever
they want, right?

31:26.841 --> 31:28.625
So go pay your taxes

31:28.669 --> 31:31.193
or trim your ear hair
or something, okrrr?

31:31.237 --> 31:33.935
Okay, um, it's your house now,

31:33.979 --> 31:34.936
so...

31:34.980 --> 31:36.982
Okay.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.420
Oh, my God,
I love this song.

31:40.463 --> 31:43.466
Is this Halsey

31:49.472 --> 31:51.126
♪

31:57.611 --> 32:01.136
Yeah, okay, I love this song!

32:01.180 --> 32:02.877
What's it called?

32:02.921 --> 32:05.532
"Endless Verses"

32:05.575 --> 32:07.186
"Waiting for the Chorus"?

32:07.229 --> 32:09.623
"Only the Bad Parts of a Song"?

32:12.408 --> 32:14.628
Mm!

32:14.671 --> 32:16.195
Okay.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.674
Cool, more people.

32:17.718 --> 32:18.762
Oh, yeah!

32:18.806 --> 32:20.242
I'm cool with this.

32:20.286 --> 32:22.244
Yeah! Come in.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.029
I'm glad a fire marshal's
not here, right?

32:24.072 --> 32:25.682
'Cause otherwise
we'd be in trouble.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.510
Okay, you go have sex now.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.686
It's fine, it's fine.
I got no responsibilities.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.863
Spill red wine on my rug.
Clog my toilet.

32:32.907 --> 32:35.866
Stick your dirty fingers
in the ice machine

32:35.910 --> 32:37.520
in my new refrigerator, huh?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.566
Wait.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.569
Wait.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.789
No.

32:45.833 --> 32:49.793
Someone dented
my new refrigerator?

32:49.837 --> 32:52.709
Okay!

32:52.753 --> 32:54.929
Young people are the worst!

32:54.973 --> 32:56.800
Attention!

32:56.844 --> 32:58.715
If you are too young

32:58.759 --> 33:00.848
to have watched
the original Full House,

33:00.891 --> 33:03.285
get out!

33:03.329 --> 33:05.374
Oh, my God.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.376
Nick at Nite doesn't count.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.770
Get out. Just go. Go. Get out.

33:09.813 --> 33:12.207
That is mine. Monsters.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.904
Go. Go. Get out!

33:18.822 --> 33:22.043
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I ruined your good-bye party.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.611
I continue to be horrible.

33:24.654 --> 33:28.397
Seriously, if I weren't me,
I wouldn't talk to me.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.182
Yeah, you were
pretty terrible.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.706
And a very unconvincing
young person.

33:32.749 --> 33:35.361
Like, were you born 40?

33:35.404 --> 33:38.233
The thing is, when
you told me your good news,

33:38.277 --> 33:39.626
I wanted to be happy for you,

33:39.669 --> 33:41.671
but instead I just felt
self-hating and competitive,

33:41.715 --> 33:43.673
which I know is wrong.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.936
But I feel behind.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.112
You know, you guys have
everything all set.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.548
You got it all figured out.

33:48.591 --> 33:49.897
VALENCIA:
Set

33:49.940 --> 33:52.073
I'm nervous as hell.
I'm going to a new city

33:52.117 --> 33:54.206
and a new job
with a new relationship.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.904
I'm hella scared.Yeah, me, too.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.210
I hate a commute.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.125
And also, randomly
I'm married?

34:00.168 --> 34:02.301
Like, what

34:05.260 --> 34:07.088
God, I'm so sorry
for being so selfish.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.873
You were heinous,

34:09.917 --> 34:12.528
but everyone's frizzy sometimes.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.314
Is it frizzy or fizzy

34:15.357 --> 34:18.752
It doesn't matter. I made it up,
and it somehow took off.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.319
God.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.581
I really backslid this week.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.191
I guess I got to up
my therapy sessions

34:23.235 --> 34:24.845
and go back to group.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.629
I haven't been to group
in a long time.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.762
Look, Rebecca, I get
why you're down on yourself.

34:28.805 --> 34:30.590
But...

34:30.633 --> 34:33.158
I mean, honestly,
I can't picture

34:33.201 --> 34:35.247
what my life would be like
without you.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.857
I never would
have met Hector,

34:36.900 --> 34:40.991
a-and I wouldn't have gone
for my supercool corporate job.

34:41.035 --> 34:42.863
VALENCIA: Yeah, and
if it wasn't for you,

34:42.906 --> 34:45.213
I wouldn't have my cool job
and awesome girlfriend

34:45.257 --> 34:47.215
if you hadn't broken up
me and Josh.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.217
PAULA: Yeah, and I
wouldn't be anywhere near

34:49.261 --> 34:51.959
law school, so duh.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.874
Because of me

34:53.917 --> 34:56.398
Mm-hmm. So we forgive you.

34:56.442 --> 34:59.271
For a lot.
A lot.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.186
Actually, can I
ask you a favor?

35:01.229 --> 35:04.537
Will you take temporary custody
of Estrella?

35:04.580 --> 35:06.408
She and Hector
don't get along,

35:06.452 --> 35:09.411
and she's so happy here.

35:09.455 --> 35:12.501
: You would
trust me with your starfish?

35:12.545 --> 35:13.850
Heather,

35:13.894 --> 35:15.635
I will guard her with my life.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.508
Oh, my God,
I love you guys so much.

35:19.552 --> 35:22.120
And we'll-we'll...

35:22.163 --> 35:23.773
we'll keep in touch, right?

35:23.817 --> 35:24.948
PAULA:
Oh, of course we will.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.733
I mean, definitely we will.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.169
Not like you guys

35:28.213 --> 35:30.693
are moving to Botswana.

35:30.737 --> 35:32.652
Wow, is that really
where he's going?Yeah.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.871
Yeah. I looked on a globe,

35:34.915 --> 35:37.787
and it's, like, you know, here.VALENCIA:
Oh, Paula.

35:37.831 --> 35:41.313
I'm so s...Excited for him and for you.

35:41.356 --> 35:45.317
Paula, you know that we love
you and we're here for you.Yeah, I know.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.275
We'll all be here
for each other.

35:47.319 --> 35:51.540
Yeah, girl group is "forevah."

35:51.584 --> 35:54.413
And "evah."And "evah."

35:54.456 --> 35:57.677
And "evah."Cheers.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.204
Well...

36:03.248 --> 36:05.032
I should go,

36:05.075 --> 36:08.122
because I only have
a little time left with him.

36:09.123 --> 36:12.387
So...
No, no, no. Good night.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.607
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

36:14.650 --> 36:17.262
And now she's stuck with Tommy.

36:39.588 --> 36:41.373
You gonna be okay?

36:41.416 --> 36:44.289
Oh, yeah. It's just amazing

36:44.332 --> 36:47.422
that this is how
everything turned out.

36:47.466 --> 36:50.033
Yeah.I mean, you're
everything I ever hoped

36:50.077 --> 36:51.818
you would be, but...

36:51.861 --> 36:55.735
nothing like I actually thought
