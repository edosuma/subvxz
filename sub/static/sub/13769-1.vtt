LOIS:

00:05.547 --> 00:07.675
Malcolm! Reese!

00:07.716 --> 00:09.885
No playing ball

00:07.716 --> 00:09.885
in the house!

00:13.138 --> 00:16.767
LOIS:

00:13.138 --> 00:16.767
No playing ball  on  the house!

00:20.103 --> 00:22.898
LOIS: No playing ball

00:20.103 --> 00:22.898
through the house!

00:25.526 --> 00:26.986
This isn't even fun.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.030
That stopped being the point

00:27.027 --> 00:30.030
a long time ago.

Oh, for God's sake, Malcolm.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.742
This is the last time

01:11.405 --> 01:14.742
I'm going to tell you.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.201
Get up right now!

01:16.243 --> 01:19.120
I'll get up when the world stops

01:16.243 --> 01:19.120
being a cruel joke,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.164
which is never!

01:21.206 --> 01:22.374
Malcolm,

01:22.416 --> 01:23.918
you smell like a locker room.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.293
This has got to stop.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.795
You've wasted your entire summer

01:26.837 --> 01:28.505
lying in bed feeling

01:26.837 --> 01:28.505
sorry for yourself.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.382
Your father thinks

01:28.547 --> 01:30.382
we sent you away to camp.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.217
You're right.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.217
I'm a pathetic loser.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.302
(sighs):

01:32.259 --> 01:34.302
Honey...

01:34.344 --> 01:36.847
this is just a phase.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.766
Every teenager goes through it.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.308
I did, your father did.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.603
Francis cried in the shower

01:40.350 --> 01:42.603
every day for six months.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.730
Reese wouldn't get

01:42.644 --> 01:44.730
out of the dryer.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.356
It's awkward and it's painful

01:46.398 --> 01:48.609
and you think

01:46.398 --> 01:48.609
it's never going to end.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.652
Now get out of bed!

01:48.650 --> 01:50.652
We're going to the zoo.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.153
Why are we going to go stare

01:52.195 --> 01:53.864
at a bunch

01:52.195 --> 01:53.864
of pathetic, caged animals

01:53.906 --> 01:56.533
and fat, suburban yahoos

01:53.906 --> 01:56.533
pointing and laughing at them?

01:56.575 --> 01:59.327
Because I have a coupon.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.081
Is the zoo one of the places

01:59.369 --> 02:02.081
where you have

02:02.122 --> 02:03.624
to be this tall

02:02.122 --> 02:03.624
to do the good stuff?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.042
I don't know.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.668
I've never been there

02:05.084 --> 02:06.668
when it's open.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.545
This is going

02:06.710 --> 02:08.545
to be so much fun.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.171
I'm so glad I ran

02:08.587 --> 02:10.171
into Matt.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.173
Yeah, that was quite

02:10.213 --> 02:12.173
a lucky break.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.009
Good old,

02:12.215 --> 02:14.009
good old Matt.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.637
It has been 20 years since

02:14.051 --> 02:16.637
I was dating the both of you.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.555
I can't believe

02:16.678 --> 02:18.555
you're still jealous.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.557
I am not jealous.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.267
I'm not even the jealous type.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.561
I was just trying

02:22.309 --> 02:24.561
to read the meter!

02:24.603 --> 02:26.271
Not in those shorts,

02:24.603 --> 02:26.271
Tarzan!

02:26.313 --> 02:30.191
Why don't you

02:26.313 --> 02:30.191
just marry Tom Cruise?!

02:30.233 --> 02:33.612
Okay, that's enough.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.612
Break it up.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.031
(phone ringing)

02:36.073 --> 02:37.116
Hello.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.199
FRANCIS:

02:37.157 --> 02:38.199
Hi, Dad.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
Francis!

02:39.242 --> 02:40.201
How's it going?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.912
Couldn't be going better, Dad.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.790
We're seeing the country,

02:41.954 --> 02:44.790
meeting great people.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.167
This is the best time

02:44.832 --> 02:47.167
of our lives.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.796
Well...

02:50.838 --> 02:52.881
I guess your mom and I

02:50.838 --> 02:52.881
were really wrong

02:52.923 --> 02:54.508
about your cross-country plan.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.301
We thought

02:54.549 --> 02:56.301
it would be a disaster.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.219
I'm not going to rub

02:56.343 --> 02:58.219
your face in it, Dad.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.471
We're having too much fun!

02:59.513 --> 03:00.722
No, thanks, Joe,

03:00.764 --> 03:01.974
I couldn't take

03:00.764 --> 03:01.974
another bite of pie.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.144
This trip has been

03:03.266 --> 03:05.144
so good for us.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.603
We have seen so many things.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.272
Majestic mountains,

03:06.645 --> 03:09.272
quiet little towns,

03:09.314 --> 03:12.734
emergency opportunities

03:09.314 --> 03:12.734
for charitable giving...

03:12.776 --> 03:14.235
That's great.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.030
It sounds like you are

03:14.277 --> 03:16.030
really making it out there.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.239
Yeah, so, about these

03:16.071 --> 03:18.239
charitable...

03:18.281 --> 03:20.075
Listen, we're on our way

03:18.281 --> 03:20.075
to the zoo right now,

03:20.117 --> 03:21.409
but you call us back

03:20.117 --> 03:21.409
next week, okay?

03:21.451 --> 03:22.786
Love to Piama.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.331
Oh, look how nice this is.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.250
And it's such a beautiful day.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.128
(sighs)

03:31.170 --> 03:33.630
You have to stop making

03:31.170 --> 03:33.630
that noise.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.174
Fine, Mom, I won't breathe.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.051
You know, son, I hate

03:35.215 --> 03:37.051
to see you like this.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.427
I tell you what. Why don't

03:37.092 --> 03:39.427
we get you a wax crocodile?

03:39.469 --> 03:40.637
DEWEY:

03:39.469 --> 03:40.637
Can we see the tigers?

03:40.679 --> 03:42.347
I'm going to go

03:40.679 --> 03:42.347
hit the monkeys.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.349
I mean, go see

03:42.389 --> 03:44.349
the monkeys.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.560
Look, Matt's Animals

03:44.391 --> 03:46.560
of the Rain Forest show

03:46.601 --> 03:47.728
starts in 20 minutes.

03:47.769 --> 03:48.937
Gee, don't want

03:47.769 --> 03:48.937
to miss that.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.647
Can I just go wait in the car?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.649
I mean, it's technically

03:50.689 --> 03:52.649
at the zoo.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.194
No. And since you're so

03:52.691 --> 03:55.194
committed to being miserable,

03:55.235 --> 03:56.778
you can be in charge of your

03:55.235 --> 03:56.778
little brother for the day.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.279
No.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.279
Great.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.279
Let's look

03:58.321 --> 03:59.698
at every animal first,

03:59.740 --> 04:02.283
then decide which ones

03:59.740 --> 04:02.283
we want to go back to.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.785
Meet back here at 5:00!

04:03.827 --> 04:05.996
Let go of me. I don't want to be

04:03.827 --> 04:05.996
your baby-sitter.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.288
I just want to be by myself.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.289
Are you mad?

04:08.331 --> 04:09.290
I'm not mad.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.291
You sound mad.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.376
Fine, I'm mad!

04:11.418 --> 04:13.003
Who are you mad at?

04:13.045 --> 04:14.129
I'm not mad!

04:14.171 --> 04:16.297
Look, you wouldn't understand.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.217
Yes, I would.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.217
No, you wouldn't.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.886
You're still living

04:18.258 --> 04:20.886
in your kiddie dream world.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.221
You don't realize

04:20.928 --> 04:22.221
you're nothing

04:22.262 --> 04:24.014
but an insignificant

04:22.262 --> 04:24.014
speck of dust

04:24.056 --> 04:26.600
lost in an uncaring universe

04:24.056 --> 04:26.600
full of random tragedy.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.144
What's a lemur?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.941
Oh, look, there's Matt.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.941
Hi, Matt!

04:33.982 --> 04:35.358
Lo-lo!

04:35.400 --> 04:37.402
Hi!

04:39.821 --> 04:42.616
Hey, Matt.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.201
Quite a zoo you got here.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.326
I got to tell you,

04:45.368 --> 04:47.204
this is an exciting day

04:45.368 --> 04:47.204
for us.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.164
We don't often get a chance

04:47.246 --> 04:49.164
to spend time with the family.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.707
You know how it is--

04:49.206 --> 04:50.707
work, work, work!

04:50.749 --> 04:52.751
But to tell you the truth,

04:50.749 --> 04:52.751
it's mostly my boss.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.128
He gets off

04:52.793 --> 04:54.128
on cracking the whip.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.378
You know,

04:54.169 --> 04:55.378
he's a real bastard.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.713
But I got a feeling

04:56.755 --> 04:58.132
that he's about to get the axe.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.675
At least that's what

04:58.173 --> 05:00.675
Jimbo in marketing says.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.055
So good to see

05:03.178 --> 05:05.055
you, Matt.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.055
Yeah.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.640
I knew you'd end up

05:05.097 --> 05:06.640
doing something like this.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.600
You always had all

05:06.681 --> 05:08.600
those cute animals.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.727
Well, you didn't think

05:08.642 --> 05:10.727
Monty was so cute.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.187
I hated that snake!

05:12.229 --> 05:13.814
Remember the time I

05:12.229 --> 05:13.814
found him in the shower?

05:13.855 --> 05:16.024
(both laugh)

05:16.066 --> 05:18.526
(forced laugh)

05:18.568 --> 05:19.778
Hey, are your kids here?

05:19.820 --> 05:20.988
I'd love to meet them.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.281
Oh, yeah, yeah, they're around.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.364
You'll recognize them.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.908
They all look like me.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.953
So, who's this little guy, huh?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.704
(shrieks)

05:35.335 --> 05:36.419
Do you want this?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.840
Too slow.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.261
Hey, watch where you're going.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.020
Big mistake, pal!

05:53.061 --> 05:55.438
You want to go? We'll go.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.398
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:55.480 --> 05:57.398
What are you doing?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.692
He started it.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.819
Goats don't start it.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.154
Get out.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.740
Guess what I get to do.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.618
Leave.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.579
If we push the car

06:08.660 --> 06:11.579
till we find a mechanic,

06:11.621 --> 06:13.414
we can pay

06:11.621 --> 06:13.414
with aluminum cans...

06:13.456 --> 06:16.335
Francis, we've been pushing

06:13.456 --> 06:16.335
the car for two days.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.919
I'm tired and I'm hungry.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.047
I'm going to buy

06:17.961 --> 06:20.047
something to eat.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.589
No, no, no!

06:20.088 --> 06:21.589
Get lottery tickets.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.424
This is exactly

06:21.631 --> 06:23.424
the kind of time

06:23.466 --> 06:24.843
when these things pay off.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.928
Honey, we're not spending

06:24.885 --> 06:26.928
our last five dollars

06:26.970 --> 06:28.847
on lottery tickets.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.847
That's crazy.

06:28.889 --> 06:33.227
Now I'm going in there

06:28.889 --> 06:33.227
and I'm buying food.  Food.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.393
Like adults eat.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.360
No wonder you were $3,000

06:38.190 --> 06:41.360
under blue book.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.446
(German accent):

06:41.400 --> 06:45.446
Cadillac? Yeah. 1974?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.032
If you say so.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.659
She is a beauty!

06:49.701 --> 06:50.952
I love your American cars.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.705
BMW could learn

06:50.994 --> 06:53.705
a thing or two

06:53.747 --> 06:58.085
but no, everything has to be

06:53.747 --> 06:58.085
about perfect engineering.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.046
Otto, what are you doing?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.382
Who is this handsome boy?

07:03.422 --> 07:04.632
Hi, I'm Francis.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.468
I am talking cars

07:04.674 --> 07:07.468
with my new American friend.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.470
And yes,

07:07.510 --> 07:09.470
he is very handsome.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.140
So, Francis, you also come

07:09.512 --> 07:12.140
to the Circle K

07:12.182 --> 07:13.516
for the wonderful hot dogs?

07:13.558 --> 07:15.852
Actually, we were

07:13.558 --> 07:15.852
just sort of passing through

07:15.894 --> 07:16.937
and our car broke down.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.980
This is so lucky for you.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.316
This is a wonderful place.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.734
We own a dude ranch

07:21.358 --> 07:22.734
just nearby

07:22.776 --> 07:27.488
with cows and horses

07:22.776 --> 07:27.488
and people.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.199
We don't own the people.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.491
We call it

07:29.241 --> 07:30.491
"The Grotto."

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
She is Gretchen,

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
I am Otto-- Grotto.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.495
You should come

07:32.535 --> 07:34.495
and visit, eh?

07:34.537 --> 07:35.872
Oh, thanks, but

07:35.914 --> 07:38.458
I'm out of work and we're

07:35.914 --> 07:38.458
kind of broke right now.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.002
Wait!

07:41.044 --> 07:43.838
I am having a thought!

07:46.341 --> 07:47.592
Eh, it's gone.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.011
He could work for us

07:47.634 --> 07:50.011
at the ranch.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.431
That was my thought!

07:52.472 --> 07:54.515
We need a ranch foreman.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.935
Wait. I don't know

07:54.557 --> 07:56.935
the first thing about ranching.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.978
Ah, you will learn.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.520
I can tell you are clever.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.563
Really, I've never...

08:00.605 --> 08:02.816
Look me in the eye.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.321
Yeah, I can tell.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.321
It is the job for you.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.573
Pays $200 a week

08:07.362 --> 08:10.573
plus free room and board.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.326
Done.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.410
I have one question.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.328
Yeah?

08:14.369 --> 08:15.536
This isn't going to end up

08:15.578 --> 08:16.788
with me cut up

08:15.578 --> 08:16.788
into little pieces

08:16.830 --> 08:18.539
and buried in a secret basement,

08:16.830 --> 08:18.539
is it?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.458
Nope.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.500
You got a deal.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.462
Okay, I got

08:21.460 --> 08:23.462
lottery tickets.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.546
We don't need 'em.

08:25.588 --> 08:29.468
(hooves clip-clopping)

08:29.509 --> 08:31.094
(clip-clopping stops)

08:32.095 --> 08:33.972
(clip-clopping resumes)

08:39.478 --> 08:40.645
Go away!

08:42.189 --> 08:43.857
Get out of here!

08:45.608 --> 08:46.776
I'm warning you.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.488
I'm not falling

08:46.818 --> 08:49.488
for your goat mind games.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.576
(screams)

08:57.412 --> 08:59.080
If nothing I do

08:57.412 --> 08:59.080
ever has any meaning,

08:59.122 --> 09:00.581
then I can't care

08:59.122 --> 09:00.581
about anything,

09:00.623 --> 09:02.376
which makes me feel

09:00.623 --> 09:02.376
even worse.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.003
How am I supposed

09:02.417 --> 09:05.003
to ever feel happy?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.587
Kid, I'm a zoo clown.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.673
Now buy a giraffe

09:06.629 --> 09:08.673
or go to hell.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.592
See, Dewey, there's a guy

09:08.715 --> 09:11.592
who understands.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.428
Malcolm,

09:11.634 --> 09:13.428
you're at the zoo.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.595
You have a Popsicle.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.848
How can you be unhappy?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.559
I wanted grape.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.602
Tigers!

09:23.688 --> 09:25.773
Where are they?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.773
They're not here.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.649
What a gyp!

09:26.691 --> 09:28.276
See, that's

09:26.691 --> 09:28.276
what I mean.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.904
The one thing you were

09:28.318 --> 09:30.904
excited about, closed.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.489
Maybe they're down here.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.698
Or maybe there never were

09:32.531 --> 09:33.698
any tigers

09:33.740 --> 09:35.033
and they just put up the signs

09:35.075 --> 09:36.410
to build a sense

09:35.075 --> 09:36.410
of disappointment...

09:36.451 --> 09:37.660
(shrieks)

09:37.702 --> 09:38.912
Dewey!

09:42.665 --> 09:43.542
I'm okay.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.625
You idiot,

09:44.667 --> 09:46.586
what the hell's wrong with you?

09:49.297 --> 09:50.590
Come on.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.636
Let's get out of here

09:53.260 --> 09:55.636
before we get caught.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.722
(snarling)

10:10.402 --> 10:12.820
Okay, Cookie, it's payday.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.197
(applause)

10:15.574 --> 10:18.076
Oh, that must happen a lot

10:15.574 --> 10:18.076
in the rain forest.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.579
Okay, if I could have

10:18.118 --> 10:20.579
another volunteer.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.039
He was pointing at me.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.292
Oh, uh... okay.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.667
Uh...

10:26.709 --> 10:28.545
Could you tell everyone

10:26.709 --> 10:28.545
your name, sir?

10:28.587 --> 10:30.671
I'm Hal. Lois's husband.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
Well, Hal, are you

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
feeling adventurous?

10:32.715 --> 10:35.385
Would you like to meet another

10:32.715 --> 10:35.385
friend from the rain forest?

10:35.427 --> 10:36.677
HAL:

10:35.427 --> 10:36.677
Ooh, I don't know.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.846
Animals that can

10:36.719 --> 10:38.846
withstand rain...

10:38.888 --> 10:41.682
Well, we better hurry,

10:38.888 --> 10:41.682
because the needless destruction

10:41.724 --> 10:44.394
of the rain forest is going on

10:41.724 --> 10:44.394
at an alarming rate.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.730
It's threatening thousands

10:44.436 --> 10:47.730
of helpless species each year

10:47.772 --> 10:50.691
like... the beautiful and gentle

10:50.733 --> 10:52.693
bird-eating tarantula.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.404
(audience oohs and ahhs)

10:54.446 --> 10:57.574
Now I know Victor

10:54.446 --> 10:57.574
looks dangerous,

10:57.616 --> 11:00.410
but the tarantula

10:57.616 --> 11:00.410
is actually a very gentle

11:00.452 --> 11:01.786
and timid creature.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.501
I am so sorry.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.086
Victor's never done

11:07.542 --> 11:10.086
anything like that before.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.672
Once the swelling goes down,

11:10.128 --> 11:13.672
the fangs should fall out.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.433
(gasps)

11:27.770 --> 11:30.773
(screams)

11:32.651 --> 11:34.194
(screams)

11:39.658 --> 11:41.535
This is where you will stay.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.994
It's a guest cabin,

11:43.036 --> 11:46.414
but you can do whatever you want

11:43.036 --> 11:46.414
to make it feel homey.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.624
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.792
Move your furniture,

11:47.666 --> 11:49.792
put up pictures.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.379
If you want to hammer

11:49.834 --> 11:52.379
a sandwich to the wall,

11:52.420 --> 11:53.463
you can do it.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.048
So, Francis, tell me,

11:55.089 --> 11:56.757
you like horses?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.552
I honestly have no idea.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.053
I love horses.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.763
Their bodies are so big

12:00.094 --> 12:02.763
and their feet are so tiny,

12:02.805 --> 12:03.848
they make me laugh.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.642
This is just

12:05.684 --> 12:06.767
so generous and nice of you.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.019
This place

12:06.809 --> 12:08.019
is so beautiful.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.480
I never want to leave.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.691
Oh, this is what happened

12:10.522 --> 12:12.691
to Otto.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.151
We were on vacation

12:12.731 --> 12:15.151
and Otto was so happy

12:15.193 --> 12:16.777
to be away from

12:16.819 --> 12:18.779
the stress of running

12:16.819 --> 12:18.779
the factory.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.864
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.201
25 heart-lung machines

12:19.906 --> 12:23.201
per day,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.786
and if you make one

12:23.243 --> 12:25.786
teeny little mistake,

12:25.828 --> 12:28.707
boy, do you

12:25.828 --> 12:28.707
hear about it.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.418
Don't move, don't

12:29.832 --> 12:31.418
move, don't move...

12:31.459 --> 12:33.712
You've been saying

12:31.459 --> 12:33.712
that for 20 minutes.

12:33.752 --> 12:34.713
I still mean it.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.047
Do you think he's mad?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.090
I don't know.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.633
I don't think it matters.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.261
Just stay quiet

12:38.675 --> 12:41.261
and try not to look like meat.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.803
Hey, I don't

12:41.302 --> 12:42.803
think you kids

12:42.845 --> 12:44.305
are supposed to be

12:42.845 --> 12:44.305
messing around down there.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.599
Yeah, thank you.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.267
Would you mind going

12:45.640 --> 12:47.267
to tell somebody

12:47.308 --> 12:48.809
that we're down here, please?

12:48.851 --> 12:50.395
Oh, for the love of God.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.189
I don't think those kids are

12:50.437 --> 12:53.189
supposed to be down there.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.608
Get us out of here!

12:54.649 --> 12:55.816
Okay, okay...

12:55.858 --> 12:56.817
calm down.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.403
We train

12:56.859 --> 12:58.403
for situations like this,

12:58.445 --> 13:01.322
and there are standard

12:58.445 --> 13:01.322
procedures we follow.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.907
What's the limit

13:01.364 --> 13:02.907
on our liability?

13:02.949 --> 13:05.826
No, the press release has to

13:02.949 --> 13:05.826
sound sympathetic to the boys.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.412
But make it clear

13:05.868 --> 13:07.412
it's their fault.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.331
No, I gave you back the key

13:07.454 --> 13:10.331
to the rifle closet.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.375
Oh, yes I did!

13:14.252 --> 13:17.255
Hey, you folks see the koalas?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.839
Okay, let's take a look.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.342
How is it?

13:21.384 --> 13:23.886
It's much better.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.555
It stopped weeping.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.223
Someone wants to say

13:25.597 --> 13:27.223
he's sorry.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.141
(gasps)

13:28.182 --> 13:29.850
Apology accepted.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
Okay, I'm going to go take

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
another look for the boys.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.104
Why don't you

13:31.894 --> 13:33.104
just rest?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.691
Hal, I don't know

13:35.315 --> 13:36.691
what to say.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.735
I just feel awful

13:36.733 --> 13:38.735
about what happened.

13:38.777 --> 13:39.778
Do you really?

13:39.818 --> 13:40.861
Of course I do.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.322
Come on, man,

13:40.903 --> 13:42.322
I think we both know

13:42.363 --> 13:44.031
that you've been

13:42.363 --> 13:44.031
holding a grudge

13:44.073 --> 13:45.784
because Lois chose me over you.

13:45.824 --> 13:46.867
Lois chose...

13:46.909 --> 13:47.868
Wait a minute.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.287
Is that what you think?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.913
I just hope this makes us even,

13:50.955 --> 13:53.458
because I can't feel my feet

13:50.955 --> 13:53.458
and you're kind of upside-down.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.875
Hal, you've got it all wrong.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.503
I wasn't angry at you.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.546
The whole situation was

13:56.544 --> 13:58.546
just too much for me,

13:58.588 --> 13:59.798
so I backed off.

13:59.838 --> 14:00.881
What?

14:00.923 --> 14:02.467
I mean, Lois is great,

14:02.509 --> 14:03.968
but I wanted to be

14:02.509 --> 14:03.968
exclusive and she didn't.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.720
On any given weekend,

14:05.762 --> 14:08.264
I didn't know if she was

14:05.762 --> 14:08.264
with you or me or Dennis...

14:08.306 --> 14:10.725
Dennis? Who's Dennis?

14:12.644 --> 14:14.103
No one.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.856
I got to go.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.905
20 minutes ago, I was worried

14:22.153 --> 14:24.905
about which one of us

14:24.947 --> 14:26.616
was going to be eaten

14:24.947 --> 14:26.616
by a tiger.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.034
Now I can relax.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.836
Okay, kids, the tigers didn't go

14:34.415 --> 14:37.836
for the steaks we threw down.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.212
The problem is

14:39.253 --> 14:42.089
they're attracted to you

14:39.253 --> 14:42.089
because you're alive,

14:42.131 --> 14:43.842
like their natural prey.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.926
There's a "but" coming, right?

14:45.968 --> 14:47.762
Well, no.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.139
But we have things

14:47.804 --> 14:50.139
under control.

14:50.181 --> 14:54.018
We're going to fire tranquilizer

14:50.181 --> 14:54.018
darts at the tigers.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.520
How long do they take to work?

14:55.562 --> 14:56.937
Less than two minutes.

14:56.979 --> 14:57.980
So, the plan is

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
to piss them off

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
and keep them awake

14:59.566 --> 15:01.234
just long enough so they can

14:59.566 --> 15:01.234
take it out on us?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.863
Hold on a sec.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.657
Okay, these people

15:05.822 --> 15:07.657
are idiots.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.949
Malcolm, it'll be okay.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
Yeah, Dewey, I hope so, too,

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
but...

15:10.993 --> 15:11.952
I'm not hoping.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.162
I  know  it'll be fine.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.121
You can't know that.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.248
Yes, I can.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.833
No, you can't.

15:16.875 --> 15:17.958
Yes, I can.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.628
I do. I know

15:18.000 --> 15:20.628
we'll be fine.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.672
Okay, just sit tight

15:20.670 --> 15:22.672
a few more minutes.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.383
Apparently they had a

15:22.714 --> 15:25.383
similar situation in D.C.,

15:25.425 --> 15:28.010
and we're trying to find out

15:25.425 --> 15:28.010
exactly what went wrong there.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.681
But the main thing is

15:28.052 --> 15:31.681
everything's going to be okay.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.974
See?

15:34.016 --> 15:35.184
Sorry. Excuse me.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.644
Excuse me, I need

15:35.226 --> 15:36.644
to get through.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.896
I'm looking for my kids.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.231
There's no kids here,

15:37.937 --> 15:40.231
that's for sure.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.982
Lois?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.982
Hal?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.902
What are you doing here?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.902
You should be lying down.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.821
Yes, I should, but then I

15:43.943 --> 15:46.821
had a conversation with Matt

15:46.863 --> 15:49.407
who informed me that there was

15:46.863 --> 15:49.407
another guy you were dating

15:49.449 --> 15:50.700
while you were dating us.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.993
Oh, my God.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.371
Oh, my God... Hal...

15:55.413 --> 15:56.456
Hal, I'm sorry.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.791
I... I meant to tell you.

15:57.832 --> 15:58.999
I-I should have told you.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.168
I just-- I could never find

15:59.041 --> 16:01.168
the right time,

16:01.210 --> 16:03.671
and I was never that serious

16:01.210 --> 16:03.671
about Larry anyway.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.005
Who the hell is Larry?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.299
I'm talking about Dennis!

16:06.340 --> 16:09.803
Dennis, right,

16:06.340 --> 16:09.803
that's who I meant.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.012
Oh, my God, who are you?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.932
Hal, please...

16:12.054 --> 16:13.932
can we discuss this tonight?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.182
Well, I don't know, Lois.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.017
Maybe you have a date.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.019
Okay, in the first place,

16:17.059 --> 16:19.019
this was all over 20 years ago.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.398
And second, it doesn't matter

16:19.061 --> 16:22.398
because I love you.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.068
And third, you were the one

16:22.440 --> 16:26.068
dating that slut manicurist!

16:26.110 --> 16:30.907
Here is where we put the houses

16:26.110 --> 16:30.907
for the horses.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.951
And here will be

16:30.949 --> 16:32.951
your office.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.454
You have pens in one drawer

16:32.992 --> 16:36.454
and paper in the other.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.748
First, I put them

16:36.496 --> 16:38.748
in the same drawer together,

16:38.790 --> 16:41.250
but no, that did not work.

16:41.292 --> 16:45.338
But if you want to try it

16:41.292 --> 16:45.338
that way, you're the boss, huh?

16:45.379 --> 16:46.547
Ah, here is Zeke.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.048
Zeke, meet Francis.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.216
Howdy. How y'all doing?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.302
He is the new ranch foreman.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.220
He will be in charge

16:51.344 --> 16:53.220
of the livestock,

16:53.262 --> 16:55.055
of the feeding schedules,

16:55.097 --> 16:56.850
of the equipment rental...

16:56.891 --> 16:58.643
well, everything.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.061
I must go and set up the buffet.

17:01.103 --> 17:06.025
I'm sure you have lots of cowboy

17:01.103 --> 17:06.025
things to talk about, huh?

17:08.987 --> 17:10.780
All right, look, I might

17:08.987 --> 17:10.780
as well tell you now,

17:10.822 --> 17:13.240
'cause you're going to find out

17:10.822 --> 17:13.240
in about 30 seconds anyway.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.575
I'm not a real cowboy.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.703
My name isn't even

17:14.617 --> 17:16.703
Zeke, it's Murray,

17:16.744 --> 17:20.080
and I have no idea what in the

17:16.744 --> 17:20.080
hell I'm doing around here.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.332
You have no idea?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.083
I've never worked on a ranch

17:21.374 --> 17:23.083
in my life.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.752
Really?

17:23.125 --> 17:24.752
Yeah. I've never even been

17:24.794 --> 17:26.295
near a horse

17:24.794 --> 17:26.295
you don't put quarters in.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.172
Oh, that's great.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.550
Listen, you know, you stepped

17:28.214 --> 17:30.550
into a gold mine here.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.093
I mean, the people who run

17:30.591 --> 17:33.093
this place are absolute idiots.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.804
Oh, I don't know.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.804
They seem really nice.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.096
"Nice" isn't the word for it.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.473
I mean, you don't have

17:36.138 --> 17:37.473
to do a lick of work

17:37.515 --> 17:38.599
and they'll still pay you.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.393
You're kidding?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.393
I'm telling you,

17:40.434 --> 17:42.102
all we got to do

17:40.434 --> 17:42.102
is watch each other's backs

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
and we can milk these people

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
for all they're worth.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.189
What do you think?

17:45.231 --> 17:49.068
I think you're fired.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.030
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:52.071 --> 17:55.616
I'm going to find out

17:52.071 --> 17:55.616
if this is for me or the horse.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.118
HAL:

17:56.617 --> 17:58.118
You broke our agreement!

17:58.160 --> 17:59.119
What agreement?!

17:59.161 --> 18:00.120
We never had an agreement!

18:00.162 --> 18:02.373
It was a mutual

18:00.162 --> 18:02.373
understanding!

18:02.415 --> 18:03.917
At least on my end!

18:03.958 --> 18:05.125
You are overreacting.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.961
So, I was dating a few guys

18:05.167 --> 18:06.961
when we met--

18:07.003 --> 18:08.295
what difference

18:07.003 --> 18:08.295
does it make?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.130
A few? Well, how many

18:08.337 --> 18:10.130
were there, Lois?

18:10.172 --> 18:12.592
Don't you get it?

18:10.172 --> 18:12.592
It doesn't matter.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.928
You won!

18:12.633 --> 18:14.928
It's history. It's over.

18:14.969 --> 18:18.305
Your engagement ring is

18:14.969 --> 18:18.305
not a family heirloom.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.223
What?

18:19.265 --> 18:20.975
I lied to you.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.975
I bought it.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.560
So you bought it.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.938
For someone else.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.189
Someone else?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.524
I'm sorry.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.150
I have kept that secret

18:28.566 --> 18:30.150
for so many years.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.151
It's haunted me.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.737
Look, I always knew

18:32.779 --> 18:35.155
that I had to tell you,

18:32.779 --> 18:35.155
but I didn't know how.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.950
Who was it?

18:36.991 --> 18:39.744
Farrah Fawcett.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.579
I was 15.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.456
I knew there were

18:41.621 --> 18:43.456
a lot of guys after her,

18:43.497 --> 18:45.875
but I thought that if I had

18:43.497 --> 18:45.875
an actual ring to give her

18:45.917 --> 18:48.586
that I would stand apart

18:45.917 --> 18:48.586
from those other idiots.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.339
I'm sorry I didn't tell

18:48.628 --> 18:52.339
you this before now.

18:52.381 --> 18:56.510
Well, why don't we

18:52.381 --> 18:56.510
just call it even.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.389
(over walkie-talkie):

18:58.387 --> 19:00.389
Hey, Randy, it's Bill.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.391
Are those two kids still trapped

19:00.431 --> 19:02.391
in the tiger den?

19:02.433 --> 19:03.851
Okay, everybody, calm down.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.185
Calm down.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.438
I'm obviously just picking up

19:05.227 --> 19:07.438
a transmission

19:07.480 --> 19:10.066
from the zoo down the road.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.191
Reese and Malcolm?

19:11.233 --> 19:12.192
Malcolm and Dewey.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.278
Reese wouldn't last 30 seconds.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.699
I think Stanley's

19:16.114 --> 19:18.699
getting angry.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.200
You named them?

19:20.242 --> 19:21.201
That's Stanley.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.620
That's French Fry.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.790
Dewey, I want to tell you

19:22.662 --> 19:25.790
something.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.624
I love you.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.208
Don't say that!

19:28.250 --> 19:29.209
It's true.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.128
I love you so much.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.211
You're just saying that

19:31.253 --> 19:32.839
'cause you think

19:31.253 --> 19:32.839
we're going to die.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.423
This is all part of

19:32.880 --> 19:34.423
your hating life thing.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.216
You're wrong.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.216
I love life.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.426
I realize that now.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.470
It's imperfect,

19:37.468 --> 19:39.470
but I love that, too.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.430
And I love Mom and Dad

19:39.512 --> 19:41.430
and Francis

19:41.472 --> 19:43.099
and even Reese.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.099
I love you all.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.059
Stop it. We're

19:43.141 --> 19:45.059
going to be fine.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.268
Why don't you stop it, Dewey?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.104
Why don't you stop pretending

19:46.310 --> 19:48.104
everything's great

19:48.146 --> 19:49.229
and tell me

19:48.146 --> 19:49.229
you love me, okay?

19:49.271 --> 19:50.940
We're not going to die!

19:50.982 --> 19:52.441
Yes, we are!

19:50.982 --> 19:52.441
We're going to die!

19:52.483 --> 19:54.944
This is the ultimate proof

19:52.483 --> 19:54.944
that I was right all along!

19:54.986 --> 19:56.821
And I don't need

19:54.986 --> 19:56.821
some stupid little kid

19:56.863 --> 19:58.156
giving me fake reassurances!

19:58.197 --> 20:00.324
Well, I don't need

19:58.197 --> 20:00.324
some crybaby brother

20:00.366 --> 20:03.327
taking all the fun out

20:00.366 --> 20:03.327
of being at the zoo!

20:03.369 --> 20:05.245
Oh, my God!

20:05.287 --> 20:06.246
(growling)

20:06.288 --> 20:07.247
You're just

20:06.288 --> 20:07.247
in a bad mood.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.290
We'll get out of this.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.168
No, we won't.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.168
Give it up, Dewey.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.294
Superman isn't going

20:10.209 --> 20:12.294
to fly in here and save us.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.130
(Reese yells)

20:16.298 --> 20:19.844
In your face, goat!

20:16.298 --> 20:19.844
Who's laughing...

20:19.886 --> 20:21.137
(screams)

20:25.892 --> 20:27.185
Open up, open up!

20:29.937 --> 20:32.314
Ever since the zoo,

20:29.937 --> 20:32.314
I've had a new lease on life.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.150
It's amazing

20:32.356 --> 20:34.150
how something as simple

20:34.192 --> 20:37.153
as almost being eaten by tigers

20:34.192 --> 20:37.153
can put things in perspective.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.321
It just feels so good

20:37.195 --> 20:39.321
to be happy again.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.992
Of course, why do  I

20:43.034 --> 20:45.203
always have to learn my lessons

20:43.034 --> 20:45.203
the hard way?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.913
No one else does.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.289
I mean, why does the universe

20:46.954 --> 20:49.289
think it has to almost kill me

20:49.331 --> 20:50.750
to get a point across?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.459
My life sucks.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.087
I'm going to bed.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.671
No, Francis,

20:54.128 --> 20:55.671
everything turned out fine.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.215
We agreed not to sue them,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.175
and they agreed

20:57.256 --> 20:59.175
not to throw Reese in jail.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.343
Enough about that.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.343
Tell me about your new job.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.469
Oh, it's great.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.763
I've learned so much already.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.472
Say, while you were at the zoo,

21:05.514 --> 21:08.308
you didn't happen to see any

21:05.514 --> 21:08.308
animals giving birth, did you?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.309
No. Why?

21:09.351 --> 21:10.310
Just curious.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.520
Never mind.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.148
(groans)

21:14.190 --> 21:16.400
Almost there, sweetie.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.400
Just one more push.
