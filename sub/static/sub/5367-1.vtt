02:26.700 --> 02:29.180
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>How are you doing this afternoon?</i>

02:29.300 --> 02:31.428
<i>Is this Rose Hill?</i>

02:31.540 --> 02:33.986
<i>This is Ed Couch.</i>

02:34.100 --> 02:36.387
<i>I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.</i>

02:36.500 --> 02:38.582
<i>I need to get up there and see her,</i>

02:38.700 --> 02:42.102
<i>but I'm gonna be a little bit late.
I'll tell you what, I'm lost out here.</i>

02:42.220 --> 02:44.951
<i>We're off the Alabama Interstate,
but I don't know where.</i>

03:19.900 --> 03:21.629
Did you hear that?

03:21.740 --> 03:23.663
What?

03:23.780 --> 03:25.703
The train.

03:25.820 --> 03:27.743
No. I didn't hear no train.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.783
Oh, nothing, I guess.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.141
- Where's Whistle Stop on the map?
- I can't find it.

03:36.260 --> 03:39.104
Why did you tell me to turn right
ten miles back there?

03:41.980 --> 03:45.302
God, you've got a negative sense of direction,
honey.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.343
I'm sorry.

03:47.460 --> 03:51.146
Oh, Ed. Your aunt's
gonna be so disappointed we're late.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.662
I know she's been looking forward to this visit
all week long,

03:55.780 --> 03:57.703
bless her sweet little old heart.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.741
Hey, how's my sweet Auntie V this afternoon?

04:05.860 --> 04:07.783
Remember us?

04:08.900 --> 04:12.621
<i>- Don't you look pretty?
- We've brought you something especially.</i>

04:14.740 --> 04:16.868
<i>Don't you know Evelyn loves you?</i>

04:18.060 --> 04:22.190
Honey, I guess it'd be better
if you just wait out here for me, or something.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.223
- I'll get all this stuff.
- Well, if...

04:24.340 --> 04:26.069
If you think it's best.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.103
Yeah, I do, this time. OK?

04:29.220 --> 04:31.268
Have a nice day, Aunt Vesta.

04:31.380 --> 04:33.621
<i>Don't you pitch a fit like that</i>

04:45.140 --> 04:47.711
Did you know they took my gall bladder out?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.346
Oh... No, I didn't.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.383
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

04:52.500 --> 04:54.707
<i>It's still in the hospital in a jar.</i>

04:56.420 --> 04:58.343
I guess that's where they keep them.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.383
I guess.

05:01.500 --> 05:07.428
When I was in the hospital, the nurse gave me
one of them Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.986
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.023
82-year-old widow, imagine that.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.142
Actually, everybody calls me Ninny.

05:16.260 --> 05:18.501
Of course, I'm just visiting here.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.861
Did you ever have one of them Fleet enemas?

05:22.940 --> 05:24.669
Um...

05:24.780 --> 05:26.509
Well...

05:26.620 --> 05:27.587
No.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.623
You'd remember it.

05:30.740 --> 05:33.789
Me and my friend Mrs. Otis
come from Whistle Stop.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.506
You ever been to Whistle Stop?

05:36.620 --> 05:39.271
Why, yes. I just passed by there today.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.271
<i>She's lived down the street from me
for 30 years or more.</i>

05:44.700 --> 05:46.589
After her son died,

05:46.700 --> 05:49.988
her daughter-in-law had a fit for her
to come live here at the nursing home,

05:50.100 --> 05:51.750
and they asked me to come with her

05:51.860 --> 05:53.191
and be her roommate.

05:53.300 --> 05:57.385
Mrs. Otis don't know it, but I'm going back home
just as soon as she gets settled in good.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.106
Does the name Idgie Threadgoode ring a bell?

06:02.220 --> 06:04.143
Um...

06:04.260 --> 06:06.183
No, ma'am. I don't think so.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.223
You'd remember her.

06:09.380 --> 06:12.589
You see, I was practically adopted
by the Threadgoode family.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.226
- I married her brother Cleo.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

06:15.340 --> 06:19.709
Idgie and her friend Ruth
ran the Whistle Stop Café.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.466
Idgie was a character, all right.

06:25.580 --> 06:31.303
<i>But how anybody could have thought
she murdered that man is beyond me.</i>

06:31.420 --> 06:33.627
I beg your pardon?

06:33.740 --> 06:36.550
You sit and relax awhile.
I'll tell you all about it.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.583
Oh, now, let's see...

06:39.860 --> 06:43.103
I remember the day
they pulled that truck up out of the river.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.143
<i>That same rainy summer day,</i>

06:46.260 --> 06:52.905
<i>Idgie Threadgoode was arrested for the murder
of the owner of that truck, Frank Bennett.</i>

06:56.980 --> 07:02.703
I guess to understand Idgie, you'd have to start
way back with her brother Buddy.

07:03.980 --> 07:06.745
<i>Idgie was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.</i>

07:09.620 --> 07:13.147
<i>I remember the day we was all getting ready
for Leona's wedding.</i>

07:13.260 --> 07:15.183
<i>The war had just ended.</i>

07:15.300 --> 07:16.745
<i>The "Great" one, you know.</i>

07:17.860 --> 07:19.749
<i>And another one was about to begin</i>

07:19.860 --> 07:21.783
<i>in the Threadgoode house.</i>

07:21.900 --> 07:25.143
<i>Sipsey, honey, is that finished?</i>

07:26.300 --> 07:28.348
Oh, Buddy. Buddy, get dressed, honey.

07:28.460 --> 07:30.383
<i>- Mama...</i>
- Leona, what is it?

07:30.500 --> 07:34.550
Idgie's upstairs in her room and she said
she won't come out just as long as she lives.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.788
- Mama, she is gonna ruin my wedding.
- Shh.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.744
Why, Leona,
you're gonna be the most beautiful bride...

07:39.860 --> 07:41.783
Well, of course she is, Papa.

07:43.020 --> 07:46.661
Your papa has spent every last nickel he has
just to make you happy.

07:46.780 --> 07:49.431
Now, you try to act a little grateful, young lady.

07:50.540 --> 07:52.463
Imogen Louise Threadgoode!

07:53.580 --> 07:55.503
This is your mama!

07:58.380 --> 08:00.906
You come down here... right now.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.749
Do you hear me?

08:02.860 --> 08:05.625
- Buddy, you fetch her. She'll listen to you.
- Come on down.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.981
<i>There's no firing squad waiting for you.</i>

08:08.100 --> 08:09.943
Oh...

08:10.060 --> 08:12.347
<i>Come on, honey. Now, let us see you.</i>

08:13.460 --> 08:15.462
<i>Oh, you look so pretty.</i>

08:15.580 --> 08:18.265
- I see London, I see...
<i>- Hush!</i>

08:19.980 --> 08:21.903
Julian, hush.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.466
<i>Come ahead, sweetheart.</i>

08:26.020 --> 08:29.581
<i>You look awful nice in that.</i>

08:29.700 --> 08:31.190
<i>- Mama!</i>
- You look fine, Idgie.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.986
<i>- She looks like a monkey.
- Julian, stop it right this second.</i>

08:35.580 --> 08:37.105
<i>- Take it back!</i>
- Idgie.

08:38.780 --> 08:41.750
I told you she was gonna ruin my wedding!

08:43.020 --> 08:44.943
Take it back! Take it back!

08:47.740 --> 08:49.469
- I'll get you for this.
- No, Buddy.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.943
- <i>Be careful when she's dressing up.</i>
- <i>She's just a pain.</i>

08:58.060 --> 09:02.463
<i>Leona, will you stop shrieking, honey?
This is your wedding day</i>

09:14.700 --> 09:17.385
<i>Looks like you got yourself up a tree, little bit</i>

09:18.500 --> 09:20.343
I'm sick of people making fun of me.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.827
So you're gonna stay up here all day long?

09:22.940 --> 09:24.465
Yep.

09:24.580 --> 09:28.426
The hell with them. Who wants to wear
that stupid old dress anyway?

09:29.940 --> 09:31.942
Did I ever tell you about the oysters?

09:32.060 --> 09:35.030
<i>- Oysters?</i>
- Didn't I tell you about the oysters?

09:35.140 --> 09:39.589
<i>Think about the millions of oysters
lying around on the bottom of the ocean.</i>

09:39.700 --> 09:41.623
Then one day...

09:41.740 --> 09:46.587
God comes along and he sees one and he says,
"I think I'm gonna make that one different."

09:46.700 --> 09:48.623
And you know what he does?

09:49.820 --> 09:51.743
He puts a little piece of sand in it.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.306
And guess what it can do that the others can't.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.185
- What?
- It can make a beautiful pearl.

09:59.980 --> 10:02.267
What if God made a mistake?

10:03.380 --> 10:07.180
Well, the way I figure it,
he never makes mistakes.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.223
I mean, he made sure we got together.

10:09.340 --> 10:13.584
He made sure you got the best-looking,
most charming brother in the world,

10:13.700 --> 10:15.748
who's gonna beat you to the chocolate cake.

10:15.860 --> 10:17.430
You will not.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.747
Got you out of the tree, now, didn't I?

10:20.860 --> 10:22.589
Did not.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.909
<i>Into this estate,
these two people come now to be joined.</i>

10:26.020 --> 10:30.628
<i>If any man present can show cause
why they might not be lawfully joined together,</i>

10:30.740 --> 10:33.983
let him speak now,
or for ever after hold his peace.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.023
Please be seated.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.588
If either of you know any reason

10:42.700 --> 10:45.465
<i>why you may not justly
be joined together in holy matrimony</i>

10:45.580 --> 10:47.947
do you now confess it?

10:57.780 --> 10:59.828
It is in your will to proceed.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.424
<i>Do you, Charles Osgood Justice...</i>

11:08.980 --> 11:12.302
<i>Thank you. I don't know what we'd do
without your generosity.</i>

11:12.420 --> 11:16.220
<i>- Sipsey, honey, look at what you've done.
- You're welcome, Mrs. Threadgoode.</i>

11:17.340 --> 11:19.069
You rascal, you!

11:25.140 --> 11:29.384
<i>I don't think there ever was</i>
<i>a sweeter boy than Buddy Threadgoode.</i>

11:29.500 --> 11:31.229
You look beautiful today, Lily.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.263
Yeah, Lily, you sure do.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.428
<i>I had the biggest crush on him.</i>

11:36.940 --> 11:38.863
<i>He was a terrible ﬂirt</i>

11:38.980 --> 11:41.187
<i>But his heart belonged to Ruth Jamison.</i>

11:42.500 --> 11:45.629
<i>Now, she was the daughter
of a friend of his mama's</i>

11:45.740 --> 11:48.220
<i>who was visiting that summer.</i>

11:48.340 --> 11:51.469
Ruth Jamison,
you're just the one I've been looking for.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.105
Are you thirsty?

11:53.220 --> 11:54.665
Let's go visit someplace else.

12:00.340 --> 12:03.549
If you think that's a big lake,
you should have seen the one by our house.

12:03.660 --> 12:05.583
We used to swim in it and fish.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.271
I sure do miss it. I sure do.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.951
Well, what happened to it? Did it dry up?

12:11.060 --> 12:12.789
No. Worse than that.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.902
Last fall, a big flock of ducks,

12:15.020 --> 12:17.466
about 40 or 50 of them,
landed smack in the middle of it.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.070
While they were sitting in it,

12:19.180 --> 12:22.423
a fluke thing happened.
The temperature dropped so fast

12:22.540 --> 12:25.350
that the whole lake froze in three seconds,
just like that.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.622
And all those poor little ducks. Did it kill them?

12:27.740 --> 12:30.505
No. They flew off and took the lake with them.

12:30.620 --> 12:34.022
Why, to this very day,
that lake is somewhere over in Georgia.

12:35.140 --> 12:37.427
Buddy Threadgoode.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.149
Just come a little closer.
I want to give you something.

12:51.260 --> 12:53.547
<i>Come here.</i>

12:57.260 --> 12:59.183
Whoa!

13:04.260 --> 13:06.627
<i>Hat, where do you think you're going?</i>

13:08.740 --> 13:11.141
Woo-oo! I've got it.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.627
Hold on, Ruth. Hold on a little bit.

13:18.860 --> 13:20.544
<i>It's all right. I've got it.</i>

13:22.620 --> 13:24.270
Come here, you damn hat.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.109
Got it! Oh!

13:26.220 --> 13:27.585
<i>Oh, I meant to do that</i>

13:30.100 --> 13:31.590
I've got it!

13:33.780 --> 13:35.509
<i>Ta-da!</i>

13:37.260 --> 13:38.386
All right.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.626
Damn. Come on.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.550
Come on.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.628
Get off.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.504
Buddy!

13:54.620 --> 13:57.703
<i>- Buddy!
- Buddy Threadgoode!</i>

13:59.340 --> 14:00.865
<i>Buddy!</i>

14:00.980 --> 14:02.630
Get out of there.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.108
Get out of there.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.950
<i>Buddy!</i>

14:11.140 --> 14:13.142
<i>- Run, Buddy!
- Buddy!</i>

14:14.220 --> 14:15.426
Buddy!

14:19.100 --> 14:20.943
No!

14:23.100 --> 14:24.101
<i>Buddy!</i>

14:25.220 --> 14:27.143
<i>No-oo!</i>

14:27.260 --> 14:28.705
<i>No-oo!</i>

14:28.820 --> 14:31.346
<i>Buddy! No!</i>

14:31.460 --> 14:34.384
Please! Let me go!

14:35.860 --> 14:37.385
No.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.423
Buddy!

14:39.540 --> 14:41.463
Come on. We've got to get back to the house.

14:41.580 --> 14:42.991
No, Mama.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.421
<i>Come on. We've got to go home.</i>

14:45.540 --> 14:46.826
Buddy!

14:46.940 --> 14:49.181
- Buddy!
<i>- You have to be strong. It's gonna be OK.</i>

14:49.300 --> 14:51.109
Buddy!

14:51.220 --> 14:53.951
The Lord is my shepherd,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.142
<i>I shall not want.</i>

14:56.260 --> 14:59.025
<i>It like to have killed us all.</i>

14:59.140 --> 15:01.711
<i>But nary a one took it as hard as Idgie.</i>

15:04.700 --> 15:08.421
<i>Everyone thought she'd die right along with him.</i>

15:25.780 --> 15:28.863
<i>Night after night, she stayed by the river.</i>

15:30.060 --> 15:35.942
<i>Big George was the only soul she'd let near her,
and he watched over her night and day.</i>

15:37.620 --> 15:41.864
<i>You know, a heart can be broken,
but it still keeps a-beating just the same.</i>

15:42.980 --> 15:48.225
Miss Idgie, you'll have to keep this blanket on
or you'll catch your death of cold, you hear me?

15:49.580 --> 15:51.503
That's so sad.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.263
Would you like one of these?

16:02.380 --> 16:04.621
Oh! Thank you, honey.

16:04.740 --> 16:06.469
Evelyn...

16:06.580 --> 16:08.503
Honey, we gotta get going.

16:08.620 --> 16:12.591
The Braves game's fixing to start
and you're gonna miss your... thing.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.429
Excuse me.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.269
That's my husband Ed.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.348
Hi, ma'am.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.383
Um...

16:21.740 --> 16:23.742
I can't believe Buddy died.

16:23.860 --> 16:25.783
Neither could I.

16:27.300 --> 16:31.589
Oh, well... I enjoyed talking to you, honey.
What's your name?

16:31.700 --> 16:34.590
Evelyn. Evelyn Couch.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.225
I've got to go.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.263
You come back and see me, you hear?

16:39.340 --> 16:41.263
OK.

16:41.380 --> 16:42.950
Bye-bye.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.422
<i>Well, first of all I want you</i>

16:45.540 --> 16:50.580
<i>to truly dedicate yourselves
to finding little ways to putting that magic,</i>

16:50.700 --> 16:53.624
that spark, back into your marriage.

16:53.740 --> 16:57.950
When we think of romance and marriage,
what is the first thought

16:58.060 --> 16:59.983
<i>that comes into your mind?</i>

17:00.100 --> 17:01.625
Divorce.

17:01.740 --> 17:05.347
Remember when marriage counsellors
told you to wrap yourself in Cellophane

17:05.460 --> 17:07.701
to put a little charge into your marriage?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.742
Do we really pay for these lectures?

17:24.099 --> 17:26.022
♪ O-oh yeah

17:28.540 --> 17:33.706

Evelyn, have you gone insane?

17:45.060 --> 17:48.906
<i>People can see you! What if I'd have been
the paperboy or something, honey?</i>

17:49.020 --> 17:50.670
Get in there.

17:50.780 --> 17:54.102
What were you thinking about?

17:54.220 --> 17:56.143
<i>Evelyn.</i>

17:57.500 --> 17:59.662
- Evelyn!
- Oh.

17:59.780 --> 18:03.421
You know, what we really need,
instead of this baloney,

18:03.540 --> 18:06.828
is an assertiveness training class
for southern women.

18:06.940 --> 18:10.103
But that's a contradiction in terms, isn't it?

18:11.220 --> 18:14.224
Especially you, sweetheart.
You're living in the Dark Ages.

Mm, you smell good, too.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.703
- Thank you.
<i>- I need one of these.</i>

18:43.940 --> 18:45.863
Oh, this looks good.

18:45.980 --> 18:48.028
Yes, indeedy.

Why don't you come in and sit down at the table
and have dinner with me?

19:05.260 --> 19:08.707
I'm sorry, honey. The game's almost over.
I just wanted to see a bit of it.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.549
Why are you so dressed up?

19:10.660 --> 19:13.982
Honey, don't get in the way there.
Just scoot over just a bit.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.225
Ed...

19:18.340 --> 19:23.665
if I'd opened the door wearing only Cellophane,
would you still be watching the baseball game?

19:23.780 --> 19:27.182
No, honey,
I'd probably be checking you into a loony bin.

19:52.140 --> 19:55.064
<i>- Hi, sugar. How's my little dumpling?</i>
- Trick or treat?

19:55.180 --> 19:57.786
<i>You won't throw one of those hissy fits,
will you?</i>

19:57.900 --> 19:59.106
No, no, no!

20:01.340 --> 20:04.742
<i>- You are meaner than a damn snake.
- I'm glad you're feeling better.</i>

20:04.860 --> 20:07.989
<i>- You need to get back in bed.</i>
- Good thing your eyesight's failing.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.663
Hey!

20:19.780 --> 20:22.545
- Hey.
- I was hoping you'd be here.

20:23.660 --> 20:27.710
My roommate, Mrs. Otis, said I could stay
and visit with her and her family,

20:27.820 --> 20:31.666
but I said, "Thank you kindly,
but I think I might have my own visitor."

20:31.780 --> 20:33.703
And here you are!

20:33.820 --> 20:36.141
- Well, now, sit down.
- Thank you.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.989
And doughnuts to boot.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.829
You can't beat that.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.546
Well, help yourself, Mrs. Threadgoode.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.230
How's your friend?

20:44.340 --> 20:46.263
- Mrs. Otis?
- Mm-hm.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.303
Well, not so good.

20:49.420 --> 20:53.345
It looks like I won't be getting home
for quite a while, and I sure miss it.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.466
Funny what you miss
when you're away from home.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.463
I miss the smell of coffee.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.503
And bacon frying.

21:03.620 --> 21:09.582
Oh... what I wouldn't give for a plate of fried
green tomatoes like we used to have at the café.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.623
Ooh...

21:16.900 --> 21:19.187
I never told you about the café, did I?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.223
No, ma'am.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.262
Well...

21:22.380 --> 21:24.303
let me back up a bit.

21:25.700 --> 21:30.149
<i>You see,
Idgie never quite got over losing Buddy.</i>

21:32.980 --> 21:35.870
<i>She hardly ever come home.</i>

21:35.980 --> 21:38.631
<i>Only Big George knew how to find her.</i>

21:40.180 --> 21:41.670
<i>She just didn't seem to care</i>

21:41.780 --> 21:43.703
<i>about anything any more.</i>

21:43.820 --> 21:45.231
<i>And then one summer day</i>

21:45.340 --> 21:48.025
<i>her mama sent for her.</i>

21:48.140 --> 21:52.031
<i>Like they say, God never shuts one door
without opening another.</i>

21:53.140 --> 21:56.223
<i>That was also the day Idgie met Frank Bennett.</i>

21:57.340 --> 21:59.468
<i>The man whose murder got her arrested.</i>

21:59.580 --> 22:01.503
Well, hello there, miss.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.543
And who might you be?

22:04.660 --> 22:06.742
Towanda to you. Who are you?

22:06.860 --> 22:10.785
Oh, Frank Bennett's the name, Miss Towanda.

22:11.900 --> 22:14.346
I must say, you are looking mighty fine today.

22:14.460 --> 22:18.226
Are you a politician,
or does lying just run in your family?

22:21.740 --> 22:24.027
<i>Mama!</i>

22:24.140 --> 22:26.063
There you are!

22:26.180 --> 22:28.103
It's about time, Idgie.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.501
If you don't look like the Wild Man Of Borneo...

22:34.620 --> 22:36.543
- There you go.
- Well, thank you.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.823
- Guess who's here.
- Who?

22:39.940 --> 22:42.420
Ruth. She's staying with us this summer,

22:42.540 --> 22:46.067
and will be in charge of all the young people's
activities at the church.

22:46.180 --> 22:49.627
- Is that why you wanted to see me?
- We have so many nice things planned.

22:49.740 --> 22:50.707
Ruth!

22:52.900 --> 22:54.823
<i>You remember my youngest child?</i>

22:54.940 --> 22:58.228
Of course I do. Hi, Idgie.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.663
Hi.

23:06.340 --> 23:08.581
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.101
Oh, it's got to work.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.143
<i>Somebody's got to help her.</i>

23:13.260 --> 23:14.546
<i>I cant.</i>

23:16.060 --> 23:18.870
Are you sure you wanna go
to this here River Club, Miss Ruth?

23:18.980 --> 23:20.630
These ain't no churchgoing folks.

23:20.740 --> 23:22.788
<i>I'll do just fine, George, thank you.</i>

23:24.940 --> 23:29.502
Oh, excuse me.
Is Idgie Threadgoode here, by any chance?

23:29.620 --> 23:31.827
Come on in, honey.
She's right down here.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.863
- Here?
- Uh-huh.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.748
I'll see you, Grady Kilgore.

23:37.860 --> 23:40.227
And I'll raise you 20.

23:40.340 --> 23:42.741
You ain't got nothing.

23:42.860 --> 23:45.101
Maybe I do and maybe I don't.

23:45.220 --> 23:48.588
Put your money where your mouth is,
Mr. Sheriff.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.063
Well, look what the cat brung in.

23:56.180 --> 23:58.103
I came to talk to you.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.622
You're gonna have to wait. I'm busy.

24:02.740 --> 24:05.186
Come on. This is your big chance.
Are you in or out?

24:05.300 --> 24:07.587
<i>It'll make you a rich man.</i>

24:07.700 --> 24:09.190
<i>You're just bluffing, as usual.</i>

24:09.300 --> 24:13.350
I'm afraid you're gonna have to excuse Idgie.
She's going home for dinner.

24:13.460 --> 24:15.701
Nice meeting you. Say goodbye, Idgie.

24:16.820 --> 24:19.869
- Where the hell are you going with my money?
- We're going home.

24:19.980 --> 24:23.666
<i>- Who are you to boss me around?</i>
- I'm the one holding your money, that's who.

24:23.780 --> 24:25.509
Give it back.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.543
Now, get in the car.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.383
All right. I'll get in the car.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.229
You win.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.991
Come on.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.590
Sucker!

24:39.700 --> 24:41.543
<i>I'll leave here when I want to.</i>

24:41.660 --> 24:44.709
I just don't know how you can break
your mother's heart like you do.

24:44.820 --> 24:47.266
I'm not doing anything to my mother.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.826
Oh, no?
Why do you think I'm over here for the summer?

24:49.940 --> 24:53.262
Your mother was worried. She thought
I might be able to talk sense into you,

24:53.380 --> 24:55.303
<i>but you're too busy being selfish.</i>

24:55.420 --> 24:57.104
What are you talking about?

24:58.260 --> 25:00.706
Idgie, you're not the only one who lost Buddy.

25:01.820 --> 25:06.986
We all... miss him, but... turning your back
on your family's not gonna help.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.228
What's he got to do with anything?

25:11.340 --> 25:13.422
<i>It looks like you're the one with the problem</i>

25:13.540 --> 25:15.463
forgetting my brother.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.865
<i>Why, just ten miles away,</i>

25:21.980 --> 25:25.951
<i>down by the river, there lurks a den of the devil!</i>

25:27.060 --> 25:29.461
<i>Where liquor and gambling</i>

25:29.580 --> 25:31.503
<i>and sin abide!</i>

25:32.620 --> 25:36.102
Snakes and serpents.

25:36.220 --> 25:38.222
<i>Hey, Scroggins!</i>

25:38.340 --> 25:42.140
You're finally preaching
about something you're kin to. Snakes!

25:43.260 --> 25:45.308
<i>As I said...</i>

25:45.420 --> 25:50.301
snakes and serpents take many disguises.

25:50.420 --> 25:53.549
<i>Let's turn to page 53 in our hymnal.</i>

25:59.980 --> 26:01.903
Yoo-hoo!

26:02.020 --> 26:05.183
Big George thought I might find you here.

26:09.420 --> 26:11.821
If you give me a chance,

26:11.940 --> 26:13.908
a chance to get to know you,

26:14.020 --> 26:15.943
maybe it'll be fun!

26:17.860 --> 26:19.783
Fun?!

26:20.900 --> 26:23.551
Idgie, just spend some time with me.

26:25.660 --> 26:27.389
- Please.
- Suit yourself.

26:29.460 --> 26:32.304
Are you sure you don't wanna back out?
It's not too late.

26:32.420 --> 26:33.831
I'm sure.

26:34.940 --> 26:36.863
Here, hold this.

26:38.980 --> 26:40.903
Tell me, now, do you like trains?

26:41.020 --> 26:42.545
Y... Yes.

26:42.660 --> 26:44.185
Good.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.428
We'll get along just fine.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.423
Boy, did we luck out tonight!

26:56.140 --> 26:58.063
Hop in.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.103
I..-

27:01.340 --> 27:03.308
Oh... give me your hand.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.548
Put your foot up there.

27:15.940 --> 27:17.863
Hold that.

27:19.660 --> 27:21.185
Look at all this.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.263
I think we should get off the train.

27:27.380 --> 27:29.030
It's starting to move.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.063
No. The fun's just started.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.703
Are you all right?

27:37.820 --> 27:40.949
Well, sometimes I get a little dizzy looking down.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.983
Don't look down.

27:57.540 --> 27:59.463
What are you doing?

27:59.580 --> 28:00.991
Come on. Look.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.829
They're throwing away food!

28:08.060 --> 28:09.983
You talk about give unto others.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.148
Yes, but this food isn't yours to give.

28:13.140 --> 28:15.063
That's church talk.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.706
I've seen those same people
over at church on Sunday

28:17.820 --> 28:22.064
over at the River Club every other night
of the week, doing anything but pray.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.668
<i>More, more!</i>

29:05.580 --> 29:07.821
OK. Time to get off.

29:08.940 --> 29:11.341
We gotta jump.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.748
- Jump?
<i>- Yeah, jump</i>

29:14.860 --> 29:16.862
<i>The next stop is five miles down the tracks.</i>

29:16.980 --> 29:18.903
I won't walk that far back.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.751
Are you crazy?

29:21.860 --> 29:24.067
<i>You're not kidding.</i>

29:24.180 --> 29:26.103
Well...

29:27.420 --> 29:29.343
I give up. Jump...

29:30.460 --> 29:33.270
I'll tell Mama I'm not
a good influence on you...

29:33.380 --> 29:35.508
You'll never jump, will you?

29:37.500 --> 29:39.423
Don't say never to me.

29:49.660 --> 29:50.627
Aargh!

29:51.980 --> 29:54.711
Towanda...!

30:06.940 --> 30:08.180
Are you all right?

30:08.300 --> 30:09.506
I'm fine.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.023
I'm all right.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.062
Ow!

30:15.180 --> 30:17.103
- Does this hurt?
- Ouch!

30:17.220 --> 30:19.143
I guess so.

30:20.260 --> 30:22.308
- We better get you to a doc... doctor.
- Shit!

30:22.420 --> 30:24.343
Which way is it?

30:24.460 --> 30:27.066
About two miles down the tracks.

30:27.180 --> 30:28.625
All right.

30:28.740 --> 30:30.663
Let's go.

30:32.060 --> 30:34.267
You'll never be able to carry me that far.

30:35.380 --> 30:37.303
I know. Never say never.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.343
I'm not carrying you.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.383
We're walking.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.550
<i>Thank you, Julian.</i>

30:49.660 --> 30:52.266
I owe you one.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.701
<i>- Aren't you ready yet?
- What?</i>

31:12.940 --> 31:16.023
This doesn't have anything to do with trains,
does it?

31:17.140 --> 31:18.869
Do you like honey?

31:18.980 --> 31:20.709
Oh, yeah, I like honey.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.345
- Fresh honey?
- Yeah.

31:22.460 --> 31:23.985
Me too.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.431
There it is.

31:27.540 --> 31:29.383
There what is?

31:31.620 --> 31:34.305
<i>You'll see.
Soon enough.</i>

31:38.180 --> 31:40.182
Now... stay here.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.223
No matter what happens,
don't move.

Wh... Why did you do that?

33:00.180 --> 33:02.103
You could have been killed.

33:03.220 --> 33:05.143
I'm sorry.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.623
Don't you want the honey?

33:08.740 --> 33:10.663

No.

No, I've heard there were people
who could charm bees.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.026
I've just never seen it done before today.

Hallelujah.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.829
And tonight.

37:17.940 --> 37:22.343
We're gonna begin to explore
our own femaleness

37:22.460 --> 37:27.341

Ruth had just got married to Frank Bennett.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.183
That's right.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.541
After Ruth left,

40:53.660 --> 40:56.709
Idgie just went back to her old ways.

40:56.820 --> 40:59.824
<i>Hanging out with Grady and the boys

<i>But after a few years,
temptation got the better of her</i>

Nothing.

and she knows what's best for her.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.585

43:50.700 --> 43:52.623
I'm not so sure about that.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.944
Oh, come on, Idgie. It's only a dance.

44:07.740 --> 44:10.346
- Miss Idgie Threadgoode...
- Get your butt off the floor.

44:10.460 --> 44:12.383
...will you dance with me?

44:15.860 --> 44:17.783
I will not dance with you

44:17.900 --> 44:19.823
and I will not marry you.

44:19.940 --> 44:23.103
Go marry Gladys Moats. She just adores you.

44:23.220 --> 44:26.064
But she did fall on her head

45:09.500 --> 45:11.423
Oh.

<i>Stop it.</i>

47:10.940 --> 47:12.510
Don't you hurt her!

47:18.580 --> 47:20.742
I wouldn't do that if I was you, mister.

47:24.260 --> 47:27.867
See, the thing is,

47:27.980 --> 47:30.221
<i>And he's... crazy.</i>

47:30.340 --> 47:32.342
<i>There's no telling what he might do.</i>

47:55.220 --> 47:57.382
Go on, get out of here.

48:08.100 --> 48:09.625
Hey!

48:09.740 --> 48:11.185
<i>Come on. Hey.</i>

48:11.300 --> 48:14.304
- Come on, now. Come on, here.
- Let's go, come on.

48:14.420 --> 48:17.629
- Are you OK?
- Let's get Miss Ruth and get out.

48:17.740 --> 48:19.947
Come on, Miss Ruth.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.983
Come on.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.946
If you ever touch her again, <i>I'll</i> kill you.

48:32.740 --> 48:34.663
I sure as hell scared him, didn't I?

48:36.180 --> 48:38.103
<i>Yeah, you sure scared him.</i>

48:38.220 --> 48:41.144
<i>Towanda, the amazing Amazon woman!</i>

48:41.260 --> 48:43.183
<i>Towanda?</i>

48:43.300 --> 48:45.223
<i>Towanda! Towanda!</i>

48:48.700 --> 48:51.624
<i>Evelyn...
Evelyn!</i>

48:51.740 --> 48:53.663
I'm sorry.

48:53.780 --> 48:56.021
I was just looking at the pictures, Missy.

48:56.140 --> 48:59.064
They have the greatest stories in that magazine,
don't they?

48:59.180 --> 49:03.026
Will I see you in group tonight?
We'll be talking about masturbation.

49:03.140 --> 49:05.063
Oh, no... I don't think so.

49:05.180 --> 49:08.627
I think I've had enough learning
for the time being, thank you.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.663
Thank you.

49:12.740 --> 49:14.310
Excuse me.

49:14.420 --> 49:16.263
Screw you!

49:23.140 --> 49:25.063
Excuse me, young man!

49:25.180 --> 49:28.229
There was no reason for you
to be so rude to me back there.

49:29.340 --> 49:31.911
- Get away from me, you fat cow!
- What did you call me?

49:32.020 --> 49:34.341
Beat it, you old bitch.

49:35.460 --> 49:37.383
Why are you being so mean to me?

49:37.500 --> 49:39.423
What did I ever do to you?

49:40.540 --> 49:42.463
I don't understand!

49:52.780 --> 49:54.703
Look at my StoveTop!

49:58.420 --> 50:00.627
You tell me what's bothering you, sugar.

50:02.740 --> 50:04.663
I just...

50:04.780 --> 50:06.703
I just feel so useless.

50:06.820 --> 50:08.743
So...

50:08.860 --> 50:10.783
So powerless.

50:10.900 --> 50:12.823
Everybody goes through that.

50:12.940 --> 50:14.863
But I can't stop eating.

50:15.980 --> 50:17.903
Every day I try and try.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.023
And every day I go on.

50:23.900 --> 50:25.823
I hide candy bars all over the house.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.068
A candy bar ain't gonna hurt you none.

50:29.780 --> 50:31.703
One, no, but...

50:31.820 --> 50:33.743
10 or 11?

50:35.260 --> 50:37.183
I can't even look at my own vagina.

50:38.300 --> 50:40.780
Well, now, honey, I can't help you on that one.

50:41.860 --> 50:45.581
I wish I had the courage to just get it over with
and get really fat.

50:49.740 --> 50:51.663
Oh, Mrs. Threadgoode, I just...

50:54.020 --> 50:57.661
I'm too young to be old
and I'm too old to be young.

51:00.300 --> 51:02.223
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.903
Are you getting hot flashes?

51:07.020 --> 51:08.943
Sometimes.

51:09.060 --> 51:12.189
You get the sweats
and your heart starts a-pounding?

51:12.300 --> 51:14.223
How did you know?

51:14.340 --> 51:17.662
Simple, honey.
You're going through the change.

51:20.700 --> 51:23.624
I used to burst into tears for no reason at all.

51:24.740 --> 51:26.663
You need some hormones.

51:26.780 --> 51:30.102
Maybe some of them Stresstabs No.4
for good measure.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.587
Really? Is that all?

51:32.700 --> 51:34.429
Sure, honey.

51:34.540 --> 51:36.463
You get yourself some hormones.

51:36.580 --> 51:38.662
And then you get out of the house

51:38.780 --> 51:40.703
and get a job.

51:41.820 --> 51:43.743
Why, with your pretty complexion,

51:43.860 --> 51:46.386
I'll bet you'll be just great with cosmetics.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.423
I know how you feel.

51:52.220 --> 51:55.064
I was about your age when I had my child.

51:55.180 --> 51:57.228
Then I went through the change of life.

51:57.340 --> 51:59.263
I didn't know you had a child.

51:59.380 --> 52:01.303
Oh, yes, I did.

52:01.420 --> 52:03.343
Albert.

52:04.860 --> 52:08.910
When he was born, the doctor said
it would be best if I didn't see him at all.

52:10.020 --> 52:13.149
He said his mind would never develop
past the age of five,

52:13.260 --> 52:16.787
and I should just put him
in an institution because

52:16.900 --> 52:20.109
the burden of raising a child like that
would be too great.

52:22.220 --> 52:24.143
Well...

52:24.260 --> 52:26.183
I thought about Ruth.

52:27.700 --> 52:29.623
She always said...

52:30.740 --> 52:32.981
...there was a separate God for children.

52:34.100 --> 52:38.105
So I just smiled at him and I asked for the baby.

52:39.220 --> 52:41.222
How could anybody think

52:41.340 --> 52:45.061
that sweet, precious baby
could ever be a burden?

52:45.180 --> 52:48.980
Why, from the minute he was born,
Albert was the joy of my life,

52:50.100 --> 52:52.023
the Lord's greatest gift.

52:52.140 --> 52:55.986
I don't believe there was a purer soul
ever lived on this earth.

52:57.100 --> 52:59.023
I had him with me till he was 30.

53:00.140 --> 53:04.065
And then he went to sleep and... didn't wake up.

53:05.380 --> 53:08.429
Sometimes I can't wait to get to heaven
to see him again.

53:13.860 --> 53:15.783
It's a boy!

53:18.940 --> 53:22.149
I think a little prayer of thanksgiving
would be in order.

53:22.260 --> 53:26.106
God damn it to hell, son of a bitch, she did it!
Here's to Ruth.

53:26.220 --> 53:30.703

- Just hold on there, Idgie.

- Yes'm. But he sure ain't joking now, is he, son?

56:02.340 --> 56:05.344
He won't even sit in the same room
and have a meal today.

56:05.460 --> 56:09.863
It don't make no kind of sense. A big old ox
like Grady won't sit next to a coloured child,

56:09.980 --> 56:13.109

57:06.580 --> 57:08.503
That used to be a lake.

57:08.620 --> 57:10.429
Yeah.

57:10.540 --> 57:12.463
And then this one November,

Then the temperature dropped so fast,
the whole lake just froze.

57:21.540 --> 57:24.146
Then the ducks took off
and took the lake with them.

57:24.260 --> 57:26.388

- Idgie!

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.030
- Let go of him!
- You let me handle this, now.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:11.826
We've seen how you treat your niggers
around here and we don't like it.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:16.662

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.103
Are you deaf or something?

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.020
I said let him go, before you get yourselves
in a whole lot of trouble!

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.301
<i>Calm down.</i>

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:33.950
We just wanted to have a little get-together and
make sure we see eye to eye on some things.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.550
<i>You hear me, now?</i>

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:41.027
Let's let him go, boys.
We've had enough fun for one night.

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.063
<i>- Turn him loose.</i>
- Come on.

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.909
No, Miss Idgie, you'll get in trouble.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.783
Well, now, that's more like it.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.141
It seems I don't recognise any of you boys.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.866
Y'all ain't from Whistle Stop, are you?

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.903
Hey.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.943
<i>What's the matter?</i>

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.983
It was Frank. He saw the baby.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.307
<i>- Are you sure it was him?</i>
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.468
So that's why those Kluxers were here.

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.503
Let me take him.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.143
Don't worry. I mean...

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:30.982
if he's dumb enough to come back again, Grady
and the Alabama boys will take care of him.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.030
And if they don't,
I'll think of something.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.063
Don't take any chances.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.181
Promise me you won't do anything...
crazy, no matter what.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.223
Me?

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.388
Not me.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.823
I'll go put him down.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.304
<i>Hey, little Buddy.</i>

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:58.025
<i>That was the last anyone saw of
Frank Bennett until the night of the town follies.</i>

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.667
<i>Ruth was away at one of
the Reverend Scroggins' many revivals.</i>

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.068
One thing a woman expects
when she gets married...

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.103
is sympathy.

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.461
Haven't you got that since you married me?

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:12.823
I sure have... from the whole town.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.862
Miss Idgie, you've got to come quick.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.863
But the show's hardly begun.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.586
You've got to come quick now, you hear me?

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.421
<i>- Run and get help, quick!</i>
- Where's the baby? Never mind.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.625
Excuse me, sir.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.346
I don't believe you should be going anywhere

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.985
with Ruth's baby.

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.861
Hi there. What can I do for you boys?

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.869
- Idgie.
- Grady.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.950
- This here is Sheriff Curtis Smoote.
- Hi there.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.109
He's over here from Georgia.
He's looking for a fella.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:25.783
- Do you recognise him?
- No.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.109
That's my husband,
but I haven't seen him in months.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.911
I heard he got run over
by a Brinks armoured truck.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:34.943
What's he done?

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.348
Nothing that we know of.
We want to find out what's been did to him.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:43.261
He told his hired man he was coming over here
to see his wife and baby, but...

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.303
he ain't never showed up back home.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.826
Hell, I told him if he showed up in this town,

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.944
we'd all have known.
It looks a little sissified to me.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.230
From what I hear, most of you boys over there
in Georgia are a little light on your feet.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.703
That's the way I heard it.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.823
Could I interest you in some pie?

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:07.750
No, ma'am, but that barbecue sure smells good.

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.063
Best damn barbecue in the state of Alabama.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.303
Here you go.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:45.345
That's your fourth one today.
I swear you're about to eat up all my barbecue.

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.383
Sit down.

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.542
You ain't fooling me, girly girl.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.582
I know who you are.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.421
I heard from Bennett's hired hand
you threatened to kill Frank Bennett.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.542
<i>Now, he ain't showed up dead yet.</i>

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:07.220
But if he does, you're in a whole mess of trouble.
You understand?

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.581
<i>What we're talking about is murder here.</i>

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.385
<i>Running afoul of the law, and don't nobody</i>

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.822
get away with that,
not even a bunch of Alabama smart alecks.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.622
If I find so much as a hair of his head,

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.265
I'll arrest you faster than you can slap a tick.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.667
<i>Cos I'm the law.</i>

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:27.669
And you can't beat the law.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.506
You sure you ain't never seen this man before?

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.749
<i>Yes, sir, I've already told you.
I ain't never seen him.</i>

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:47.591
You'd do anything for Miss Idgie,
wouldn't you, boy?

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.263
Yes, sir.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.503
Would you kill for her?

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.827
Did you kill for her?

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.942
No, sir.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.189
Well, now, maybe one of these days
you'll tell the truth.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:19.101
Just remember, we hang lying niggers
in Georgia just as fast as they do in Alabama.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.745
Yes, sir.

I've been thinking.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.504
I had a dream the other night.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.543
I dreamt that...

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.583
Buddy was gone.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.987
I ran to his crib and there he was,
sleeping like an angel.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:26.391
And you know, I thanked God
for letting me still have Buddy.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:33.428
And I remembered having the same reaction
after Frank would beat me,

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.589
thanking the Lord
for giving me the strength to take it.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:42.184
And I remembered... thanking the Lord
for each day that my mother lived.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.783
Even when she was spitting up blood
and praying for me to kill her.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.783
<i>I looked in my mother's eyes,</i>

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.426
pleading for me to help her.

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:58.464
And all I could do... was pray.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.023
While... While you were gone,

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.063

ever tries to take my child,

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.663

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.383

<i>And Smokey Lonesome had been missing
ever since that same terrible night</i>

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.621
<i>I remember the day when he showed up again.</i>

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.663
By God, son,

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.101
you're the spitting image of Ruth.

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:26.951
Buddy Threadgoode Junior.
Nice to meet you, sir.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.745
Well, sir, Smokey Lonesome.

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.864
<i>Curtis Smoote was making
one of his visits to Whistle Stop,</i>

01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:38.589
<i>still hunting and pecking for any scrap
of evidence about Frank Bennett's whereabouts.</i>

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.021
<i>- Who wants to begin?
- I do!</i>

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.869
- I do, Miss Ruth.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.903
We'll begin on page five.

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.261
<i>Life has a funny way of working things out.</i>

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.109
Well, hey there!

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.143
<i>Smokey!</i>

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.591
Idgie?

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:58.022
Smokey Lonesome.
Well, if it isn't old home week!

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.587
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Well, I'm rattling but I'm rolling.

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.589
What brings you to these pans?

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.670
- The smell of good cooking.
- Hey, Smokey.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:09.703
Let me fix you some lunch.

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:13.950
I think you know just about everybody
except maybe Curtis Smoote.

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.903
<i>He's an officer from Valdosta, Georgia.</i>

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:21.390
He's been looking for the same man
for almost five years. A very stubborn fellow!

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.423
<i>He loves our barbecue.</i>

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.104
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.063
<i>Mommy, help!</i>

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.269
Buddy!

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.303
Everybody out of the way.

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.343
Let me in. Give him here.

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:41.825
Let him go.

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.863
I got him.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.062
He's gonna be all right. Open the door!

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.063
Put him in the back.

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.148
Get him in the car. It's all right, honey.

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:16.861
I can understand having a funeral for an arm.

01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:20.268
I just don't know why I should insist
on calling him Stump.

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.224
<i>She said everybody else
gonna be calling him that</i>

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.661
So we might just as well be the first.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.549
<i>OK, ice cream and cakes for everybody
in the café.</i>

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:41.061
My daddy always used to say
there was a separate God for children.

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.831
<i>The good Lord
was watching over Stump that day.</i>

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.462
<i>But then it started to rain that month.</i>

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:55.221
<i>And it rained and it rained,
and it flooded parts of Whistle Stop.</i>

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.425
<i>And that's why Grady's deputy stumbled
onto Frank Bennett's pick-up truck.</i>

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.823
<i>And I just knew</i>

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.068
<i>Idgie would never get out of this mess.</i>

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.103
Now, are you in or out?

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.747
- Remember, Ruth, I didn't take any cards.
- Let me see your face.

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.511
- Idgie, I have to talk to you.
- You're bluffing.

01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:16.829
Grady, sit in, I'll deal you a new hand.
Gladys won't mind.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.863
In private, Idgie.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.903
Excuse us, Ruth.

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:25.824
I'm just trying to teach you
not to fall for any tricks.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.863
You're doing a great job.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.183
What's your hurry?

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.223
What is so important?

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.783
What's that?

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:48.063
<i>Somebody found Frank Bennett's truck
in the river.</i>

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.143
What's that got to do with me?

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:54.901
Well, officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.022
You're in my custody until tomorrow.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:00.542
I'm supposed to take you over to Georgia
first thing in the morning.

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.583
<i>Unless, of course...</i>

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:09.462
Well, some people have been known to pack up
and sneak out of town in the middle of the night.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.746
<i>What about Big George?</i>

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:20.307
Well, the way I figure it,
they'd be satisfied if they had him.

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.343
Idgie, this is serious.

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.383
We're talking murder of a white man.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.423
Someone's gonna have to pay.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.463
Nobody wants to hang a woman.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.863
No deal.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.189
Idgie, I know how you feel about Big George.
Hell, we all do.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.223
But these are just the facts of life.

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.223
I can't do that.

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:48.468
Take me to jail if you have to.

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:52.026
Well, that's what I thought you'd say!

01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.381
You are absolutely, unconditionally,

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:58.744
positively the most stubborn person
I've ever known in my life!

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:03.469
<i>So Idgie and Big George
went to the county jail</i>

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:07.141
<i>in Valdosta, to await trial
for the murder of Frank Bennett.</i>

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.383
<i>They didn't have to wait too long.</i>

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.423
Did you know Frank Bennett?

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.269
No, sir.

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:18.908
You mean to tell me you never met the man
whose wife, Ruth, is your business partner?

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.943
<i>That's right.</i>

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:27.147
You never threatened to kill Frank Bennett, at his
home in front of his hired man, in June 1932,

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.388
the same Frank Bennett you did not know?

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.423
<i>Oh, that was me, all right.</i>

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.986
<i>I thought you wanted to know if we'd ever met.</i>

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.023
<i>The answer's no.</i>

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:41.863
<i>I threatened to kill him, but we were never
what you might say, properly introduced.</i>

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:45.905
Is it not true that in September of 1932,
you came to Valdosta

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:49.661
<i>and took Frank Bennett's wife and child
back to Alabama with you?</i>

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.703
Just the wife. The child came later.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.424
How much later?

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.463
The usual. Nine months.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.265
<i>Well, I suggest</i>

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:03.261
that you bribed this poor weak woman
with promises of liquor and money

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.782
and she lost control of her senses momentarily.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.029
And when her husband came back to get her
and take her home,

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:14.589
you and your coloured man
murdered him in cold blood.

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.270
No, sir.

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:21.988
Well, where were you on the night of
September 30th, 1933?

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.023
I was at the town hall doing a show.

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.667
- And after that?
- I was over at my mother's house.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.703
Oh, yeah? Who was with you?

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.743
<i>Just Big George and myself.</i>

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.386
What about your mother? Can she confirm that?

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.662
No, sir. She died a year ago.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:41.991
I'm sorry to hear that. But, Miss Threadgoode,
do you expect 12 intelligent men to believe you,

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.343
although one witness is dead
and the other is a coloured man

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.066
known to be a worthless, no-good, lying nigger?

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.945
You expect these men to take your word for it

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:53.381
<i>just because you say so?</i>

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:57.300
That's right, you gump-faced, blown-up,
baboon-assed bastard!

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.383
<i>One more outburst like that,</i>

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.788
and I'll hold you in contempt of court,
do you understand?

01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.550
Yes, sir.

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.583
Lord!

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.623
Next witness, please.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:18.700
<i>Did you know that you were pregnant
at the time you left Valdosta?</i>

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.743
<i>Yes.</i>

01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:29.223
<i>And yet you tell us over and over
that you went with this woman willingly.</i>

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:33.061
Yes, I wouldn't raise my child with Frank Bennett.

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:35.103
<i>But Why?</i>

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.541
<i>Did this woman promise you money?</i>

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.583
No.

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.623
<i>A bigger home?</i>

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:44.664
No... no.

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.703
<i>Then tell us, Mrs. Bennett,</i>

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:51.462
<i>why would a respectable Christian woman
go anywhere with this Idgie Threadgoode,</i>

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:54.789
<i>- whose reputation is known far and wide...
- Objection!</i>

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:58.222
Objection sustained.

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:07.229
<i>Why did you leave
with Idgie Threadgoode that day?</i>

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:12.261
<i>Answer the question, Mrs. Bennett.</i>

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:15.303
Because she...

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.904
...she's the best friend I ever had.

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.148
And I love her.

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:27.501
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Bennett. That will be all.</i>

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:33.263
<i>The defence calls as its last witness
the Reverend Herbert Scroggins.</i>

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.224
Place your right hand on the Bible,
please, Reverend.

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.263
I brought my own, if you don't mind.

01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.382
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.423
I do.

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:54.427
<i>Do you have information about the whereabouts
of Idgie Threadgoode and her coloured man,</i>

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:59.546
known as Big George,
on the night of September 30th, 1933?

01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:01.583
Yes, sir, I do.

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:06.342
<i>It has been suggested here that she and
her coloured man were at her mother's house.</i>

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.383
<i>Can you confirm that?</i>

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.390
No, sir. That is a lie.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.106
Shit.

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:20.148
<i>It has been my habit to write down all the dates
of the activities of the church in my Bible.</i>

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:24.709
<i>And I've shown that
the night of September 30th, 1933</i>

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:29.223
was the start of our annual revival
down at the Baptist camp ground.

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:32.468
Sister Threadgoode was there,

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:36.380
<i>along with her hired man George Pullman,</i>

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.423
who was in charge of the barbecue,

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.429
just as he has been every year

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:43.066
<i>- for the last ten years.
- Objection!</i>

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:47.469
That doesn't mean anything. The murder could
have taken place any time in the next few days.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.026
Have you ever been to one of our revivals, sir?

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.063
<i>Well, no.</i>

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:54.421
Do you attend church regularly, sir?

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:56.588
Of course I do.

01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:03.345
<i>Good. Well, maybe if you attended one of
our revivals, you'd know they last three days</i>

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.667
and three nights. Your Honour.

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:10.670
<i>Approach the bench.</i>

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:15.023
Percy, it don't look like you've got a case at all.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:17.063
In the first place, there's no body.

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:20.104
Second, we've got us a preacher
nobody's going to dispute.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.949
But, Your Honour...

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.064
I'm telling you what you've got
is a whole lot of nothing.

01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.308
<i>I say Frank Bennett got himself drunk,</i>

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:32.311
<i>drove into the river and was long ago eaten up.</i>

01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.548
And I don't give a good goddamn!

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.311
What we got us here
is a case of accidental death.

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:40.422
Case dismissed!

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:51.303
See you in church, sister?

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.343
Reverend.

01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.986
I can't believe he actually swore on the Bible.

01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.023
Well, not really.

01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:05.862
If that judge had looked any closer, he'd have
seen it was really a copy of Moby Dick.

01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.943
But why did he do it?

01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:15.191
For the sheer joy of seeing you in church again,
which I suggested to him might be your penance.

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.746
- You didn't promise him?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:19.783
And I never break my word.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:23.222
If I live a thousand years,
I will never forgive you for this.

01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:25.991
I don't know what's worse, church or jail.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.026
Towanda!

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.989
Evelyn... what in the hell are you doing?

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.023
I need some light and air.

01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:03.782
Why don't you step outside and take one of
your walks or your jogs or whatever it is you do?

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.783
And there's no dinner, either!

01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:09.186
Ed,

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.622
do you have any idea
why I've been going to all these classes?

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:15.346
<i>- No.</i>
- I've been trying to save our marriage.

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:19.909
What's the point of my trying if you're gonna
just sit on your butt drinking beer

01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:21.943
and watching baseball...

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.983
basketball...

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:26.023
football...

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.871
bowling and hockey and golf and...

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.863
...Challenge of the Gladiators?

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.983
Mrs. Couch?

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:42.341
I'm Sue, Mrs. Otis's daughter-in-law.

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:45.703
How are you? I've heard so much about you
from Mrs. Threadgoode.

01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:49.347
She is so sweet. She's been looking after
my mother-in-law for years.

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:52.066
Well, now, how is Mrs. Otis doing, by the way?

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:56.390
Much better, thank you. I guess it just takes time
getting used to a strange place.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:00.346
Glad to hear it. I know Mrs. Threadgoode's been
anxious to get home for some time.

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:04.431
Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode
doesn't have a house any more.

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.463
They tore that down.

01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.231
- What?
- Well, they had to. It was falling apart.

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.263
And it was condemned.

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.303
Oh, no.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.343
Does she know that?

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:19.111
<i>No, well, we didn't see any point in telling her.</i>

01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:21.427
<i>It would just break her heart, poor old thing.</i>

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:25.225
But I am so glad I got a chance to meet you.

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:27.468
You take care of yourself, now. Bye-bye.

01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.663
Evelyn, hey.

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.509
<i>Hey...</i>

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.543
Do you like my roses?

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:48.070
Since I can't get home to look at my own roses,
I made myself a paper garden.

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:51.423
<i>- I've got everything but the bugs.
- They're lovely.</i>

01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:53.941
- Have you been here long?
- Happy birthday.

01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:56.983
I shouldn't have woken you up.

01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:01.230
Of course you should. Don't you never
let me sleep through a visitors' day, honey.

01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:03.263
I look forward to them all week.

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:05.303
So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode. So do I.

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:11.665
Oh, I can't believe you remembered!
You made me fried green tomatoes!

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:17.383
They're delicious!

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.423
It's your recipe. Are they cold?

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:20.826
No.

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:24.990
They're just the way we used to have them
at the Whistle Stop Café.

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.786
You couldn't be sweeter to me
if you were my own daughter.

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.823
Here's your napkin.

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.863
Wait, wait, wait.

01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:34.903
Queen!

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.903
You know,

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.943
I don't feel 83.

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.188
It son of slipped up on me.

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:50.867
I never expected to live this long.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:54.904
Of course, the Lord takes us home
when he wants us.

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.103
Are you all right?

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.707
I was thinking about Ruth.

01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:16.664
After the trial was over,
everything went back to normal.

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.182
<i>Till that fall when Ruth lost her appetite.</i>

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:22.906
<i>By the time Dr. Hadley looked at her,</i>

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:26.263
<i>he said the cancer was so bad
she only had a couple of weeks.</i>

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.667
<i>We moved her to the Threadgoode house</i>

01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.784
<i>and put her downstairs
so she'd be more comfortable.</i>

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:37.703
<i>Sipsey moved in with her and never left her side.</i>

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.029
<i>Idgie just prayed for a miracle.</i>

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:05.903
Now, listen to me.

01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:09.701
Make sure he graduates.

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.743
And don't...

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.422
let him come to the funeral.
I don't want him going through that mess.

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:18.463
Would you quit talking like that?

01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:20.503
What funeral?

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:24.466
You're gonna be back on your feet again
and just fine

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:26.503
<i>in just a few days.</i>

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.543
<i>Just you wait.</i>

01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:33.028
What's the matter, son?

01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.503
Let's go for a walk.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.342
<i>Did you get into a fight?</i>

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.383
I got punched in the nose.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.423
I can't play like everyone else.

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:53.384
Hey, did I ever tell you the story
about... the oysters?

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.821
All the millions of them just lying around.

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.591
And God puts sand in one of them
and makes a pearl.

01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:00.623
Oh.

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.831
Did I ever tell you about Eva's three-legged dog?

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.863
How it never felt sorry for itself,

01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:10.905
and howl ought to be smarter than a dumb dog
and not feel sorry for myself?

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.741
You listen to everything I say, don't you?

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.783
You get real mad at me when I don't.

01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.223
You know about your mama.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.263
She's sick.

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:29.303
Mm-hm.

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:33.942
You see, now is the time for courage.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.983
I guess you already know that...

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:43.627
...there are angels masquerading as people
walking round, and your mom is the bravest one.

01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:50.783
Come here.

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:00.226
Mommy, I can hit! You should see me!

01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:05.346
Aunt Idgie, she hit me in the back with
a curve ball. I didn't duck and I hardly cried.

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.383
She hit you?

01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:14.190
She did that to me once, too, but...
I think I did cry.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.984
<i>Mama?</i>

01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:21.023
I'm sorry if you're sad.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:26.350
Well, give me a big kiss, then,
and I'll never be sad again.

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.503
And you best not be sad neither.

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:37.304
You understand?

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.743
You promise?

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.385
Promise.

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.229
Attaboy.

01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:47.263
You can go and wash up.

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:12.063
Sweet baby.

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.503
You two be alone now.

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:20.946
Hey, girl.

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:27.023
No.

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:31.383
That's nice.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.303
Will you do one thing for me?

01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.343
Yeah, anything.

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.428
Be good to yourself.

01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:42.463
Even...

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:48.421
...settle down if you can find someone
who can beat you in poker.

01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.984
There are so many things I wanna say to you.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:02.623
No.

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.663
I love your stories.

01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.351
Tell me a story, Idgie.

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.623
<i>Go on, you old bee charmer.</i>

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.868
<i>Tell me a good tall tale.</i>

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:26.101
Tell me the one about the lake.

01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:29.623
What lake?

01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:33.028
The one that used to be here.

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.583
Well, that was just a lie.

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.343
I know that, fool.

01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:47.031
Tell me anyway.

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:50.063
Tell me a story.

01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.903
One time...

01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:00.943
there was this lake.

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:09.061
And it was right outside of town.

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.787
We used to go fishing and swimming
and canoeing in it.

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:23.150
See, one November, this big flock of ducks
came in and landed on that lake.

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:29.784
And then the temperature dropped so fast
that the lake just froze right there.

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:32.385
And they er...

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.231
The ducks... they...

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.824
...flew off, you see,
and they took that lake with them.

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:47.024
Now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:50.303
Can you imagine?

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.583
It's all right, honey.

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.623
Let her go.

01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.663
Let her go.

01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:58.303
You know, Miss Ruth was a lady.

01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:04.504
And a lady always knows when to leave.

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:15.781
<i>When I think on our departed sister
Ruth Jamison,</i>

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.824
<i>I'm reminded of our Lord's
Sermon on the Mount.</i>

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:23.990
<i>It's funny how strong
Ruth affected everyone.</i>

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.023
<i>Even Smokey Lonesome.</i>

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:30.863
<i>When he died a few years back,</i>

01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:32.903
<i>he had one possession on him.</i>

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.223
<i>A picture of Ruth.</i>

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.580
<i>He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.</i>

01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.862
<i>We all were.</i>

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.940
I shouldn't have told you this.

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:55.585
I hate death.

01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.583
It scares me so.

01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:00.623
Death is nothing to be afraid of.

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:04.062
Look at me, I'm at the jumping-off place,
and I ain't afraid one bit.

01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.502
Oh, Ninny.

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:10.861
You're so brave.

01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:14.583
Ruth and Idgie were brave, not me.

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.507
I wouldn't be afraid of death if I was you.

01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.821
I'd be more afraid of driving

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.863
<i>in rush-hour traffic.</i>

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.783
Hi, honey.

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:47.823
Look what I got you.

01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:50.863
Ed!

01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:52.903
How sweet!

01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.943
Lilies. My favourite.

01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:57.950
I know. Sometimes I even amaze myself.

01:44:58.060 --> 01:44:59.983
What's the occasion?

01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:02.023
Honey, I just...

01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.666
feel sorry about the past few months, you know.

01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.782
I don't know what you're really up to,

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.823
what's going on with you, but...

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:12.661
I guess I could have been more helpful
with your job and everything.

01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.703
Well, why are you er...

01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:19.347
Why are you putting up this wall
where you just tore one down?

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:22.304
Well... I changed my mind.

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:26.345
Well, I don't mean to seem dense or anything,
but what's changed?

01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:28.383
The air and the light.

01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:33.143
Ed...

01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:38.504
You remember how you used to tell me
you always wanted two women in your house?

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:40.543
Oh, God.

01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.185
Yeah.

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:45.183
Well...

01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.906
what if I was the younger of the two?

01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.909
I don't believe I get your drift.

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:54.422
I want something more than
I've ever wanted anything before.

01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:59.142
I want to bring Mrs. Threadgoode to our home.

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:02.383
I want her to live here with us.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.707
I want to give her the love she's given me.

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:07.743
You're kidding me, aren't you?

01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.783
I'm absolutely serious.

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:12.904
That's why I'm putting the wall
to Kyle's room back up.

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.943
Well, honey...

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.506
this isn't something you're just gonna do.

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:23.262
She's an old woman. What if she got sick
or something? Who's gonna take care of her?

01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:24.905
I will.

01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.943
I can't leave her in that place.

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:30.587
She's not a stray cat or something.
Hell, she isn't even family.

01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.623
- She's family to me.
- Now, Evelyn.

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:35.663
<i>Evelyn...</i>

01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.663
<i>Honey...</i>

01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.662
<i>Er... look...</i>

01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:45.586
Have you mentioned
this harebrained idea of yours to her?

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.828
- Not yet.
- Well, good!

01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:50.864
Then we'll just pretend it never happened.

01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:53.904
I'm making my own money now.
I'll pay for everything.

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:55.943
You don't have to do a thing.

01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.983
Evelyn...

01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:02.023
...it's never gonna happen.

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.063
So just forget about it.

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.143
Don't you ever say never to me.

01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.071
Someone helped put a mirror up
in front of my face.

01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:22.103
And I didn't like what I saw one bit.

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:24.143
And you know what I did?

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.785
I changed.

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:29.551
And that someone was Mrs. Threadgoode.

01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:33.426
She needs my love and care now.
And I'm gonna give it to her.

01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:39.026
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the gym.

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:47.783
And if you won't listen to reason,

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.823
there's always Towanda.

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:06.503
Hey, Nin...

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:12.823
What are you doing?

01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:14.863
Those are her things.

01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:17.904
What are you doing in here?
Where is Mrs. Threadgoode?

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:19.351
Who?

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:22.225
Mrs. Threadgoode, the woman who lives here.
Are you deaf?

01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:27.471
I'm sorry, miss. All they told me was that
the woman who lived in here died this morning.

01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:32.143
Oh, my God.

01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:34.183
What...

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:37.223
What are you saying?

01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:39.263
<i>Well, she died early this morning.</i>

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:44.181
<i>They were short-handed, so they asked me
to take all this stuff down. That's all I know.</i>

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:05.863
Stop!

01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:07.903
What is the matter with you people?

01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:11.626
Can't you wait a goddamn day, for Christ's sake?

01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:14.710
Do you have no respect? These are her things!

01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:18.745
I'm sorry, miss, but they told me
to get this room ready for another patient.

01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:22.182
She may be just another patient to you,
but she was my friend.

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:24.223
And I loved her.

01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:25.830
Sorry.

01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.863
I'm just following orders.

01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:29.550
What is going on here?

01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:32.584
Why didn't you call me?
You could have at least called me.

01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:36.750
Sorry, Mrs. Couch. It just never occurred to me
that you would take it this hard.

01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:40.182
- I didn't even get to tell her goodbye.
- I know.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:43.941
These things are difficult.
But she died peacefully in her sleep.

01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:47.223
To tell the truth,
I thought you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.741
- Happy?
- Why, yes. This is what she wanted.

01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:51.783
What, to be dead?!

01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:53.823
No, to go home. You just missed her.

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:56.181
She left in a yellow cab about a half-hour ago.

01:49:57.260 --> 01:49:59.661
I don't understand. What, a cab?

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.830
She said there wasn't no reason for her to stay
now that Mrs. Otis had died.

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.863
Mrs...

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:08.586
Otis is dead?

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.623
Oh, Mrs. Otis died.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.663
Mrs. Otis died!

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:15.703
Mrs. Otis!

01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:17.743
Mrs...!

01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:20.511
Not that I'm glad that Mrs. Otis died, it's just...

01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:23.861
Oh, God, I've got to stop her.

01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:02.903
Hey, Evelyn.

01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.943
Somebody stole my house.

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:06.983
It was right here when I left.

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:09.023
Unless...

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:12.428
Oh, Evelyn, you don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?

01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:14.463
It was here when I left.

01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:16.503
No, honey, you're not crazy.

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:18.543
This is the place.

01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:21.709
Well, why would anyone
want to steal an old lady's home?

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.183
It wasn't worth nothing.

01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:27.826
Oh, honey. Nobody stole it.

01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:29.863
They had to tear it down.

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:31.903
It was condemned.

01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:34.466
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:36.901
Somebody should have told me.

01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.341
I'm old. I'm not a child.

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.383
I'm sorry.

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:46.944
My husband Cleo and I lived in this house
for more than 40 years.

01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:49.983
Now it's gone.

01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:53.463
83 years' worth of living.

01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:56.026
And all that's left of me is what's in this box.

01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:58.905
A bunch of old cards and pictures.

01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.943
Come on. I'll take you home.

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:02.983
This is my home!

01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:05.023
And now it's gone.

01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:07.063
And Mrs. Otis has gone.

01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.023
I don't quite know what to do.

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:16.065
It's the first time I can remember
when I don't have a soul to look after.

01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:18.626
You can come look after me and Ed.

01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:23.631
You're sweet,
but I think you're doing just fine on your own.

01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:26.346
Don't you know you'd be like a gift for us?

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:29.667
You're the reason I get up every morning!

01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:33.101
And that Mary Kay's having such a good year.

01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:37.702
And that I don't look like
some blob from a horror movie.

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:41.221
Well, with a little help from Idgie and Ruth.

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:43.422
Come on.

01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:45.463
I've got your room all ready.

01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:48.867
What does Ed say about all this?

01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:50.903
He'll learn to love it.

01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:59.865
Did I ever tell you
that Mrs. Otis was Sipsey's baby sister?

01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:01.903
- No, ma'am.
- Yes, she was.

01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:05.308
Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey and me
the night Sipsey died.

01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:11.347
Sipsey told me a story that night
I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:16.705
<i>The story about what really happened
the night Frank Bennett disappeared.</i>

01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.983
The show's hardly begun.

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.182
You've got to come quick now, you hear me?

01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:07.104
Never mind.

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:26.625
Excuse me, sir.

01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:30.346
I don't believe you should be going anywhere

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.064
with Ruth's baby.

01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:47.022
<i>- Like I said, you ain't going nowhere.</i>
- Damn, you're a thick-headed son of a bitch,

01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:48.266
ain't you?

01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.509
I told you you ain't going nowheres
with Miss Ruth's baby.

01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:06.063
Come on, angel. Come on.

01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.103
Come on, sweetheart.

01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:10.143
It's all right.

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.308
It's all right, baby.

01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.706
<i>It was self-defence.</i>

01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:21.824
<i>I don't know why any white jury
would care why] did it.</i>

01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:25.149
- I saw it and I can testi...
- Excuse me, here.

01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:27.183
I don't mean no offence here,

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:30.349
but I don't know who is less likely
to convince the jury,

01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:32.542
my mama or Mr. Smokey here.

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.264
No offence taken.

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.667
You're a good man, Mr. Smokey.

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.511
- You did good.
- The sun's almost up.

01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.103
George...

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:50.663
I think...

01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:52.703
it's hog-boiling time.

01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:55.983
No, ma'am. It ain't cold enough.

01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.023
It's hog-boiling time.

01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:04.023
<i>Hey, George...</i>

01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:07.268
...when is that barbecue gonna be ready?

01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:09.303
It's gonna be ready any time now.

01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:12.344
It smells so damn good
I just can't wait to get me some.

01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.591
Now, don't you forget to call me
when that's ready.

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:18.623
All right.

01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:32.303
Here you go.

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.343
Miss Idgie.

01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:38.667
Smokey left town.

01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:41.021
I thought it'd be best under the circumstances.

01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:44.866
He asked that you tell Ruth goodbye.

01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:47.903
Shame he had to go.

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.341
This is about the best barbecue I ever ate!

01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:06.988
The secret's in the sauce.

01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:18.383
Sipsey?

01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.423
My God.

01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:23.464
That frying pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:28.421
Did Idgie really barbecue Frank Bennett?

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.463
Oh, you're pulling my leg!

01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:33.106
The secret's in the sauce, or so I've been told.

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:40.270
Now you know why Idgie had to go on trial.

01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:43.946
She knew the law would never believe Sipsey.
No!

01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:49.191
Sipsey or Big George or anyone else of colour
would have been hanging from the nearest tree.

01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:54.100
To this day,
I'm still not sure whether Ruth ever believed

01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:57.144
that Idgie didn't kill Frank Bennett.

01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:01.183
Truth's a funny thing sometimes.

01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.223
I feel better now.

01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:07.263
Good.

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:12.102
I feel better because all these people will live
as long as you remember them.

01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.143
You reminded me...

01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.991
about what the most important thing in life is.

01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:20.421
- Do you know what I think it is?
- No, ma'am.

01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:22.463
Friends.

01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:24.503
Best friends.

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:26.543
Oh, Ninny.

01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:30.103
Look.

01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:35.903
Oh.

01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.222
Idgie?

01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.183
Idgie's alive?

01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:04.223
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:07.662
She's still out and about,
charming bees and selling honey.

01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:09.828
Sometimes I think I catch a glimpse of her.

01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.263
Maybe we'll see her today.

01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:21.870
Maybe.

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:25.630
Let's go.

01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:41.344
<i>After Ruth died and the rail road stopped running,</i>

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:46.266
<i>the café shut down
and everybody just scattered to the winds.</i>

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:50.429
<i>It was never more
than just a little knockabout place.</i>

01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.463
<i>But now that I look back on it,</i>

01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:55.503
<i>when that café closed,</i>

01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:58.021
<i>the heart of the town just stopped beating.</i>

01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:04.831
<i>It's funny how a little place like this
brought so many people together.</i>
