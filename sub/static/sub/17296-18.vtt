Santa?
What do you want?

01:11.593 --> 01:13.421
You must be here for some

01:13.464 --> 01:16.206
of my delicious
little eggs, right?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.903
Looks like my hunch was right!

01:17.947 --> 01:20.210
Santa is trying to take over
the holiday again!

01:20.254 --> 01:22.560
It's up to us
to save the Easter Bunny!

01:22.604 --> 01:24.214
Oh, do we have to?

01:24.258 --> 01:26.216
I'm tired of savin'
holidays, man,

01:26.260 --> 01:27.565
especially this one.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.872
Yeah, that bunny creeps us out.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.134
Don't worry, Santa,

01:31.178 --> 01:33.397
plenty more where
that came from.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.925
Nasty!

01:39.969 --> 01:42.406
Nasty or not. It is our duty as
superheroes to protect the innocent,

01:42.450 --> 01:44.147
regardless of how creepy
they are!

01:44.191 --> 01:45.148
Titans, go!

01:56.203 --> 01:57.421
Ahhh!

02:03.645 --> 02:05.429
We saved Easter!

02:08.954 --> 02:11.218
Oh, they all want Easter too?

02:11.261 --> 02:13.307
It's because the Easter Bunny
is so pathetic.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.398
Must we fight
all of the Bunny's battles?

02:19.269 --> 02:21.141
If we don't, we risk losing
the holiday as we know it.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.623
Would that really be
such a bad thing?

02:27.712 --> 02:29.932
It would if something
even worse took its place.

02:31.325 --> 02:32.674
I don't understand

02:32.717 --> 02:35.633
why all those meanies
want my little holiday.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.809
It is because
you are the creepy weakling,

02:37.853 --> 02:39.637
and therefore, the easy target.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.596
Unless you stand up
for yourself,

02:41.639 --> 02:43.337
Easter will always be in danger.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.469
But I don't want to fight.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.689
I just want
to lay my little eggs.

02:50.082 --> 02:51.214
These are for you.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.607
- Thank you.
- Ew! Thanks.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.348
- Nice gesture, I think.
- Thank you very much.

02:54.391 --> 02:57.177
Uh, didn't you used to hide
those good chocolate eggs,

02:57.220 --> 02:58.526
like the ones from the store?

02:58.569 --> 03:00.223
These are more special

03:00.267 --> 03:02.269
because I make them myself.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.140
Go ahead.
Eat them.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.012
I, uh... Man, I had
a big breakfast, you know?

03:07.056 --> 03:08.318
Please.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.626
I like to watch people
eat my eggs.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.236
Mmm.

03:17.371 --> 03:20.025
Man, I liked Easter
much more when I ain't know

03:20.069 --> 03:21.070
where these eggs come from.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.857
Well, it's like my dude,
George Horace Lorimer said,

03:25.901 --> 03:28.643
"If there's anything worse than
knowing too little, it's knowing too much."

03:28.686 --> 03:30.340
Now, as adages go,
he's definitely top five,

03:30.384 --> 03:31.385
but...

03:31.428 --> 03:33.691
Guys, you got to see this!

03:33.735 --> 03:36.216
- Look.
- It is the chocolates.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.522
Yo! This ain't no booty eggs!

03:38.566 --> 03:40.698
They appear to be
chocolate Easter eggs.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.265
The Easter Bunny
must have realized

03:42.309 --> 03:43.832
no one wants
to eat his booty eggs.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.704
I'm not sure these are
from the Easter Bunny.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.098
He seemed very intent on
handing out those booty eggs.

03:49.141 --> 03:52.580
Friend Robin, do not look upon
the horse with the mouth gift.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.713
Mmm.

03:55.757 --> 03:58.412
Wow! This is really good.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.023
Mmm.

04:01.066 --> 04:04.722
Oh, wow. This is the sweetest
chocolate I ever had, yo!

04:04.766 --> 04:07.725
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
Super sweet.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.553
We can enjoy Easter again.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.924
Oh, so good.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.578
Yes. But my teeth.

04:34.622 --> 04:37.146
They cry out in agony!

04:37.189 --> 04:38.756
Mine too.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.932
Ow! They hurt!

04:40.976 --> 04:42.456
Especially this one.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.596
Ugh, this overly sweet chocolate

04:52.640 --> 04:54.772
is causing our teeth
to fall out!

04:54.816 --> 04:56.470
Oh, I see you have been

04:56.513 --> 04:59.473
enjoying my delectable
chocolates, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.953
The Tooth Fairy!

05:01.997 --> 05:04.434
Great! As if one creep
wasn't enough today.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.654
I see it all so clearly now,

05:06.697 --> 05:08.786
chocolate that makes
your teeth fall out.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.572
The Tooth Fairy is planning
to take over Easter!

05:11.615 --> 05:13.487
Very good, my little plum.

05:13.530 --> 05:17.099
No one loses teeth eating the
Easter Bunny's eggs anymore.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.275
Very disgusting, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.583
So, I will deliver chocolates
for the children to enjoy.

05:22.626 --> 05:25.455
Your chocolates
made our teeths fall out, yo!

05:25.499 --> 05:27.631
Yes, special chocolate.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.330
My own recipe. Extra sugar.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.505
It is win-win!

05:31.548 --> 05:33.289
The people get
their Easter chocolate,

05:33.333 --> 05:36.031
I get their teeth,
ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.380
What about the Easter Bunny?

05:37.424 --> 05:38.816
Oh, what a creep.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.950
No one will miss him
or his disgusting eggs.

05:41.993 --> 05:44.300
That may be true,
but we can't let you do this!

05:44.344 --> 05:46.781
Oh, what a shame,
ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.827
Shall we settle this with a
tooth eating competition?

05:49.871 --> 05:52.308
We'll settle this
with our fists!

05:52.352 --> 05:55.703
Have it our way, da-da-da-da-da.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.837
Molars, incisors, canines!

06:02.536 --> 06:03.667
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.799
Ra-ta-ta.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.019
Argh! We have to stop
the Tooth Fairy!

06:08.063 --> 06:10.718
Dude, we should just stay
out of it for once.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.633
Maybe this is one holiday
we can't save.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.374
It's too risky.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.332
Remember, something even
worse could replace it.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.247
We must maintain the status quo.

06:18.290 --> 06:21.206
But we cannot stand against
the creep of the Tooth Fairy.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.035
Then we need someone
even creepier!

Are you gonna let her?

Mmm, I guess.

06:52.890 --> 06:55.197
No! No, you are not!

09:39.579 --> 09:41.015

09:41.058 --> 09:43.060
I am unsure if we
saved the holiday or not.

Uh, I'm pretty sure
we made things worse, yo.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.238

09:49.763 --> 09:51.852

Gee, fellas,
I can't thank you enough.

she's love of my life.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.903

Ew! Ugh!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.091
That just ain't right!
