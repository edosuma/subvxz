      NARRATOR: Tonight on
   The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.471 --> 00:05.537
  I found a description of the
 finger drains in Smith's Cove.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.606
     These drains were made
           by placing

00:07.708 --> 00:09.008
   two stones on their edges.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.175
              ALEX:
This is new information for us.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.543
              DOUG:
  Look between those two rocks.

00:11.645 --> 00:12.845
    There's an opening there.

00:12.947 --> 00:13.812
   It was a triangular shape.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.547
              RICK:
   That could be a box drain.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.583
   -It's just over here, guys.
     -RICK: We've never seen

00:17.685 --> 00:18.684
     another stone like this
          on the island.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.486
   Almost like Roman numerals.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.688
 MARTY: It's mysterious, and it
  was found near the Money Pit.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.257
     TERRY: Whoa! Looks like
 we have something there, Rick.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.226
That's some kind of a structure.

00:30.097 --> 00:33.599
  NARRATOR: There is an island
      in the North Atlantic

00:33.701 --> 00:37.036
  where people have been looking
    for an incredible treasure

00:37.138 --> 00:40.339
     for more than 200 years.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.308
     So far, they have found
           a stone slab

00:43.411 --> 00:45.911
   with strange symbols carved
             into it,

00:46.013 --> 00:48.714
       mysterious fragments
          of human bone,

00:48.816 --> 00:52.484
  and a lead cross whose origin
         may stretch back

00:52.586 --> 00:54.953
           to the days
     of the Knights Templar.

00:55.056 --> 00:59.525
    To date, six men have died
   trying to solve the mystery.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.428
    And, according to legend,

01:02.530 --> 01:05.564
    one more will have to die

01:05.666 --> 01:09.201
       before the treasure
          can be found.

             (sighs)

01:26.654 --> 01:29.188
   Just gonna take some photos
         from this side.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.790
      What do you guys got?

01:31.892 --> 01:34.259
     Well, we got the base,
          more or less.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.028
             MARTY:
      What does that mean?

01:36.130 --> 01:37.830
             LAIRD:
     Basically, they crudely

01:37.932 --> 01:39.832
       tapered the boards,

01:39.934 --> 01:41.934
 drove them into the sea horizon

01:42.036 --> 01:44.103
   till they kind of curled up
          and stopped.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.673
     NARRATOR: For brothers
      Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:47.775 --> 01:49.675
     their massive excavation
         at Smith's Cove

01:49.777 --> 01:54.113
     has started to pay off,
     and in surprising ways.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.048
              RICK:
       How deep are they?

01:56.150 --> 01:58.183
  So that's its farthest point
         of penetration,

01:58.285 --> 02:00.152
    right where you can see,
          right there.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.588
      The thing still looks
      real sturdy, though.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.089
   Here, yeah. They-they drove
      these ones fairly...

02:04.191 --> 02:05.524
    most of them fairly well.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.892
              Whoa!

02:06.994 --> 02:09.794
     NARRATOR: One day ago,
       just after the team

02:09.896 --> 02:12.097
    unearthed the mysterious,
       U-shaped structure,

02:12.199 --> 02:14.032
    which was first discovered

02:14.135 --> 02:17.836
    by veteran treasure hunter
     Dan Blankenship in 1971,

02:17.938 --> 02:22.407
     they made an unexpected
     and exciting discovery.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.775
    Quite a significant wall.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.244
       That's well-built.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.513
        MARTY: Oh, yeah,
     it's pretty impressive.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.281
  This is totally undiscovered.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.116
          Look at that.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.252
              JACK:
  It looks like stacked rocks.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.387
  NARRATOR: They also unearthed
         further evidence

02:35.489 --> 02:38.323
         of what appears
      to be a French drain--

02:38.425 --> 02:42.594
     an ancient system using
      various sizes of rocks

02:42.696 --> 02:46.098
         to divert water
  from one location to another.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.000
  A couple years ago, we found

02:48.102 --> 02:50.302
        what we described
   as a "French drain system."

02:50.404 --> 02:53.405
         We're continuing
   to make assessments of what

02:53.507 --> 02:55.874
        we're uncovering,
     but the hope is to come

02:55.976 --> 02:58.877
   to a complete understanding
     of what this represents.

02:58.979 --> 03:02.915
  Somebody dug on the shoreward
     side of this structure.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.883
     And this, also they...
          It looks like

03:04.985 --> 03:07.653
  the base of it and along the
sides of it, to a certain level,

03:07.755 --> 03:09.121
they tried to pack it with clay.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.089
   You think they packed clay
         on this side--

03:11.192 --> 03:12.558
  the side you're standing on?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.560
         You can see it.
      That's all the same.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.861
         We were pulling
       much larger clumps

03:15.963 --> 03:17.329
  and chunks out of this side,

03:17.431 --> 03:19.932
       so, but, I believe
  that was the initial effort,

03:20.034 --> 03:21.767
           and perhaps
    that was what they packed

03:21.869 --> 03:24.203
        the initial slot
   that they keyed these into.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.039
      I don't know. I think
there's two phases of work here.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.674
             MARTY:
           Smith's Cove

03:28.776 --> 03:30.909
    has been... frustrating,

03:31.011 --> 03:32.911
  even by Oak Island standards.

03:33.013 --> 03:37.349
     These walls don't appear
  to be consistent in material.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.785
     They don't appear to be
   consistent in construction.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.387
      They don't give away,
  at least in an obvious sense,

03:42.489 --> 03:44.423
          what on earth
        their purpose was.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.159
   But... we're still digging
        in Smith's Cove,

03:47.261 --> 03:49.127
         so the answers
    may still be down there.

03:49.230 --> 03:53.065
  Whoever dug the trench in...
  uh, on this shoreward side of

03:53.167 --> 03:55.000
   the wall here, uh, they...

03:55.102 --> 03:57.002
      they would have piled
      some boulders there.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.504
  Start with the cross section
      of what we, you know,

03:59.607 --> 04:01.273
            we think,
   or they must have thought,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.875
   that something was probably
    going that way. Let's see

04:03.978 --> 04:05.711
 -if they continue up that way.
             -Okay.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.313
   RICK: Okay. We got our work
         cut out for us.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.216
  NARRATOR: As Rick, Marty and
   the team continue their work

04:11.318 --> 04:14.219
         at Smith's Cove,

04:14.321 --> 04:17.322
           Alex Lagina,
      along with researchers

04:17.423 --> 04:21.226
Doug Crowell and Paul Troutman,
travel some ten miles northeast

04:21.327 --> 04:24.062
     -to the town of Chester.
       -ALEX: Okay, guys.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.999
     -Off to Chester, right?
     -Yup. The Lordly House.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.635
           -Oh, yeah.
     -It's part of the, uh,
  Chester Historical Society's,

04:29.737 --> 04:31.403
      -uh, museum network.
            -Mm-hmm.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.172
 My understanding is it's quite
a large collection of documents.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.674
   Oh, I think there's several
    thousand documents there.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.309
            NARRATOR:
          After learning

04:37.411 --> 04:40.078
    that the Chester Municipal
         Heritage Society

04:40.180 --> 04:42.214
        may have extensive
   Oak Island searcher records

04:42.316 --> 04:43.882
    from the past 200 years...

04:43.984 --> 04:45.517
              PAUL:
      See what we can find.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.953
    NARRATOR:  ...Doug, Paul
       and Alex are hoping

04:48.055 --> 04:50.455
  to find any that could contain
         important clues

04:50.557 --> 04:54.359
  that will help with the team's
   operations at Smith's Cove.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.495
The excitement level's building,
   because we're gonna be able

04:56.597 --> 04:58.630
    to see quite a collection
   of materials and documents.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.599
         We want to help
      find that one thing.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.067
           Hopefully,
   the research will do that.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.870
        PAUL: All right,
    we have some information.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.371
 DOUG: Just some light reading.
     Early history, right up

05:06.473 --> 05:08.273
      -to Triton documents.
             -Great.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.109
 Yeah, we have some interesting
  photographs in here, as well.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.944
             -Great.
  -Hopefully, there's something
          that pertains

05:13.047 --> 05:14.680
 -to the project at Smith's Cove
       and the Money Pit.
            -Mm-hmm.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.381
     -Let's get through it.
        -PAUL: All right.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.983
  Compared to some other trips
        that we've made,

05:18.085 --> 05:19.918
      uh, there's a lot more
            manageable

05:20.020 --> 05:21.586
      amount of information
       at the Lordly House,

05:21.689 --> 05:23.055
       but it's still a lot
          to go through.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.023
    It's gonna take Doug, Paul
        and me a long time

05:25.125 --> 05:26.892
  to get through all this stuff.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.666
  PAUL: Yeah. It's interesting
        right here, Alex.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.269
    Um, Gilbert Hedden wrote
     a letter to R.V. Harris

05:37.371 --> 05:39.271
          in 1936 here.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.707
   He's talking about finding
     a wood-shaped structure

05:41.809 --> 05:43.709
  with the ends of two timbers

05:43.811 --> 05:45.977
    protruding from the rocks
        on Smith's Cove.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.814
    And he actually includes
   a diagram right here, too,

05:48.916 --> 05:52.117
of it, and it looks very similar
    with the Roman numerals.

05:52.219 --> 05:57.923
  NARRATOR: A diagram from the
1936 records of Gilbert Hedden,

05:58.025 --> 06:01.927
     showing a wood structure
    featuring Roman numerals?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.563
       Could it be the same
        U-shaped structure

06:04.665 --> 06:07.299
     that the team unearthed
         just last week,

06:07.401 --> 06:12.838
     and that Dan Blankenship
       discovered in 1971?

06:12.940 --> 06:15.874
 So, this is believed by Hedden

06:15.976 --> 06:17.776
           to be made
    by the original workers,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.212
so this could still be in there,
         so that's worth

06:20.314 --> 06:21.713
          looking into;
       that's a good find.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.815
   I found a newspaper article

06:23.917 --> 06:27.452
  that had a description of the
 finger drains in Smith's Cove.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.721
       The finger drains?

06:29.823 --> 06:32.391
            NARRATOR:
             In 1850,

06:32.493 --> 06:34.526
   while looking for the source
        of the ocean water

06:34.628 --> 06:36.461
        that was flooding
          the Money Pit,

06:36.563 --> 06:38.730
   members of the Truro Company
            discovered

06:38.832 --> 06:40.699
   five finger-like box drains

06:40.801 --> 06:43.368
        some 500 feet east
         at Smith's Cove.

06:43.470 --> 06:46.972
   Constructed of flat stones,
       which were supported

06:47.074 --> 06:49.741
         by smaller rocks
       to form an opening,

06:49.843 --> 06:52.677
      these drains appeared
     to converge at the beach

06:52.780 --> 06:54.846
      into a single tunnel,
         heading due west

06:54.948 --> 06:57.416
       toward the legendary
         treasure shaft.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.918
         Listen to this.
       This-this is by far

07:00.020 --> 07:02.854
          the most, uh,
detailed description I've heard.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.990
         And this comes
         from an article

07:05.092 --> 07:07.793
  written in The Yarmouth Herald
       in February of 1863.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.529
         -ALEX: Mm-hmm.
     -DOUG: So, I think this

07:10.631 --> 07:12.864
  would stand as the most early
  account of the finger drains.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.499
          So, it says,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.134
     "Five small drains were
            discovered

07:16.236 --> 07:18.570
          on the shore,
   due east of the Money Pit."

07:18.672 --> 07:22.207
        "These drains were
       each 66 feet long."

07:22.309 --> 07:25.977
      -Drains were 66 feet.
  -Each drain was 66 feet long.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.579
         "The outer ends
    of the two outside drains

07:27.681 --> 07:29.881
  "were exactly 66 feet apart...
           thus forming

07:29.983 --> 07:32.250
    an equilateral triangle."

07:32.352 --> 07:35.654
     Those are measurements
  that seem like they could fit

07:35.756 --> 07:37.756
 -within the U-shaped structure.
            -Mm-hmm.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.958
      So if that was indeed
     some kind of cofferdam,

07:40.060 --> 07:42.494
         that leaves us
with two exciting possibilities.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.464
 One, that it was searcher built
     to explore the drains,

07:45.566 --> 07:48.300
  or that it was original works
      to create the drains.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.101
  Right. Either way, we should
     be close to the drains.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.837
             -Yeah.
         -And confirming

07:51.939 --> 07:53.972
that part of the legend, anyway.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.241
  "These drains were all built
       upon beach stones,

07:56.343 --> 08:00.912
   and were made by placing two
   flat stones on their edges."

08:01.014 --> 08:03.181
       -Like this. Mm-hmm.
 -Closed at the top, yeah, yeah.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.483
        So, I'm picturing
     a triangular structure.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.951
 And then it goes on to say that

08:06.053 --> 08:08.587
       "wherever there was
     a joint in the stones,

08:08.689 --> 08:11.690
      "one was laid across,
      protecting the joint,

08:11.792 --> 08:13.658
 "and the hole was covered over
      with a foreign grass

08:13.760 --> 08:16.094
         like the inside
       of a coconut husk."

08:16.196 --> 08:18.263
              ALEX:
           The article

08:18.365 --> 08:21.666
  describing the finger drains
 that were found in the 1860s--

08:21.768 --> 08:23.635
            this seems
      like the kind of thing

08:23.737 --> 08:25.971
  that we would've found before,
    so I was quite surprised.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.572
This is new information for us.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.574
     It's a good description
         of-of something

08:29.676 --> 08:31.710
  that was found, and something
   we should be able to find,

08:31.812 --> 08:35.447
and, uh, you know, solid numbers

08:35.549 --> 08:38.049
  and measurements that we can
 confirm with, don't you think?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.851
 I think so. And you know what?
         I think we got

08:39.953 --> 08:41.152
     to get this information
        back to the guys.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.320
            I agree.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.556
            Let's go.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.627
     Charles, you see that?
  Look between those two rocks.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.061
    There's an opening there.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.329
        That's that thing
       that you discovered

08:51.431 --> 08:53.498
        -in the archives.
     -RICK: Hard to imagine

08:53.600 --> 08:55.333
 Mother Nature made those stones
           like that.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.674
       NARRATOR: Following
    their exciting discoveries

09:02.776 --> 09:06.745
  at the archives of the Chester
  Municipal Heritage Society...

09:06.847 --> 09:09.414
           -Hey, guys.
       -MARTY: Hey, guys.
        -DOUG: Gentlemen.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.349
            NARRATOR:
   ...Alex Lagina, Doug Crowell

09:11.451 --> 09:13.318
and Paul Troutman have arranged

09:13.420 --> 09:15.320
          to meet Marty,
      Rick and other members

09:15.422 --> 09:17.322
      of the Oak Island team

09:17.424 --> 09:21.359
  at the Mug & Anchor Pub in the
    nearby town of Mahone Bay.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.329
  RICK: What have you gentlemen
           been up to?

09:24.431 --> 09:26.665
          A little bit
      of a road trip today.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.101
  We were over to Lordly House
           in Chester.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.837
         They have, uh,
      archives over there,

09:32.940 --> 09:36.841
      and, uh, we made, uh,
 kind of an exciting discovery.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.410
      We just were looking
          for anything

09:38.512 --> 09:40.011
that might help in Smith's Cove,

09:40.113 --> 09:42.380
and, uh, we did find an article,
      I think, from 1863...

09:42.482 --> 09:45.317
              -Yup.
         -...discussing
      the excavations there

09:45.419 --> 09:48.420
       and their discovery
      of the finger drains.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.721
              DOUG:
 What was really interesting is,

09:49.823 --> 09:51.056
    there was a description.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.325
   It said that they uncovered
       five finger drains,

09:53.427 --> 09:56.928
  they were each 66 feet long,

09:57.030 --> 10:00.865
    and the two outer drains
       were 66 feet apart.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.535
       They all converged
        back up the beach

10:03.637 --> 10:05.437
       to within four feet
         of each other,

10:05.539 --> 10:07.939
       and then, there was
    a collection system there

10:08.041 --> 10:13.178
 that they found what they said
       was a flood tunnel.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.647
       Has anyone measured
   the U-shaped structure yet?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.082
             MARTY:
    I measured it with Laird.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.085
         It is 20 meters
    across the leading edge.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.688
     -That's 65 and a half.
             -Yeah.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.625
            NARRATOR:
      The U-shaped structure

10:26.727 --> 10:28.393
measuring nearly the same width

10:28.495 --> 10:31.196
         as the legendary
        stone box drains?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.966
   Could the U-shaped structure
   have been built by searchers

10:35.068 --> 10:38.069
     as a means of disrupting
  the island's infamous network

10:38.171 --> 10:39.704
        of flood tunnels?

10:39.806 --> 10:43.041
    Or could it be much older?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.610
          Perhaps built
    by the original depositors

10:45.712 --> 10:49.280
    during their construction
   of the flood tunnel system?

10:49.383 --> 10:52.784
 But it was even more detailed,
 because it said that each drain

10:52.886 --> 10:55.820
         was big enough
  for a man to fit his arm in,

10:55.922 --> 10:58.289
       and that the drains
  were made of two flat stones,

10:58.392 --> 11:02.360
   they sit on edge, closed at
 the top and open at the bottom.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.463
       So I visualize that
     as a triangular shape.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.234
              JACK:
  We could be just about to hit

11:09.336 --> 11:11.736
    some of these box drains
      if they still exist.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.139
      DOUG: I think you got
      to keep your eye out

11:14.241 --> 11:17.409
 for an abundance of flat-sided
   rocks, flat on both sides.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.344
      If they're just here,
      there and everywhere,

11:19.446 --> 11:21.579
         maybe they tore
        the drains apart.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.649
        MARTY: All right,
     well, what's clear is,

11:24.751 --> 11:26.918
 we need to do more work there.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.420
         -JACK: Exactly.
       -Look, I come back

11:28.522 --> 11:30.822
        to the same place
         I always land.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.825
 If there is really nothing and
 there never was anything here,

11:33.927 --> 11:36.628
        then how crazy is
  what happened on this island?

11:36.730 --> 11:39.397
           It's almost
   the most crazy story of all.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.167
 GARY: And in this day and age,
       we still don't know

11:42.269 --> 11:44.002
 what the U-shaped structure is.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.603
      -We're gonna, though.
 -GARY: Let's get back to work.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.406
   Let's get back to work and
 uncover... and find something.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.909
              GARY:
            Let's go.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.748
            NARRATOR:
      The following morning,

11:56.850 --> 11:59.350
       Craig Tester arrives
      at the Money Pit site,

11:59.453 --> 12:01.619
where he has arranged a meeting
        with Tory Martin,

12:01.722 --> 12:05.924
      an expert in the field
    of gyroscopic technology.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.092
           -Hey, Tory.
          -Hey, Craig.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.727
            NARRATOR:
      Tory has been invited

12:08.829 --> 12:10.995
            to examine
      the boreholes drilled

12:11.098 --> 12:13.131
        during the team's
     recent coring operations

12:13.233 --> 12:16.401
    in an effort to determine
    just how plumb or straight

12:16.503 --> 12:18.236
        they actually are.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.872
          This will help
      the team know for sure

12:20.974 --> 12:23.007
     whether they are hitting
      their intended targets

12:23.110 --> 12:24.809
      or just missing them.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.546
            The key,
   we're looking for a tunnel

12:28.648 --> 12:31.816
    -at the 100 to 110 foot,
             -Okay.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.252
    maybe even a little less,
   but right around 100 foot.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.588
       The whole idea is,
       back in the 1860s,

12:36.690 --> 12:38.223
      they had this shaft,

12:38.325 --> 12:40.658
    and it had a tunnel going
     over to the Money Pit,

12:40.761 --> 12:42.193
       and then there was
       a massive collapse

12:42.295 --> 12:44.062
       -in the Money Pit.
             -Yeah.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.432
            NARRATOR:
             In 1861,

12:47.534 --> 12:49.400
    a team of treasure hunters
          began digging

12:49.503 --> 12:52.971
a large shaft some 18 feet west
    of the original Money Pit

12:53.073 --> 12:55.974
          in an attempt
    to bypass the booby traps

12:56.076 --> 12:58.076
         that had foiled
     previous search efforts.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.011
         It didn't work.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.480
        Just one foot shy
         of their target,

13:02.582 --> 13:04.949
           the shaft--
   known simply as Shaft Six--

13:05.051 --> 13:09.821
   began flooding with seawater
     and eventually caved in.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.124
       Soon after, several
     loud crashes were heard,

13:13.226 --> 13:14.592
   leading workers to speculate

13:14.694 --> 13:17.095
        that the Money Pit
          had collapsed

13:17.197 --> 13:19.697
  and that any possible treasure
        it once contained

13:19.800 --> 13:24.269
   now lay scattered among tons
      of timber and debris.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.437
            CHARLES:
       Uh-oh, that's wood.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.872
         Five weeks ago,

13:27.974 --> 13:29.874
          while drilling
     an exploratory borehole

13:29.976 --> 13:32.644
     at a depth of 109 feet,

13:32.746 --> 13:34.746
           Rick, Craig
     and members of the team

13:34.848 --> 13:36.915
     found what they believe
        could be evidence

13:37.017 --> 13:39.484
          of Shaft Six.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.820
       If it is Shaft Six,
     it's been long sought.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.956
     If the team can pinpoint

13:45.058 --> 13:47.225
       the elusive shaft's
         exact location,

13:47.327 --> 13:50.829
    they should be able to use
a 60-inch-wide drilling caisson

13:50.931 --> 13:54.165
  to excavate what they believe
  is the Money Pit debris field

13:54.267 --> 13:57.702
      and any treasure that
   may have been buried there.

13:57.804 --> 14:00.505
             CRAIG:
So, the whole idea is, you know,

14:00.607 --> 14:03.274
       at 100-foot level,
  is part of the treasure, uh,

14:03.376 --> 14:05.410
  left in place in this tunnel?
          And then, uh,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.879
     depending on, you know,
  the ones that hit the tunnel,

14:07.981 --> 14:09.681
       how close they are,
       we'll probably put

14:09.783 --> 14:11.616
     one of the big caissons
           down there

14:11.718 --> 14:13.418
to try to intercept this tunnel.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.752
          -Sounds good.
             -Okay.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.689
   NARRATOR: Because drilling
         at great depths

14:17.791 --> 14:20.825
  can often result in drill bits
     straying several degrees

14:20.927 --> 14:23.294
   from their intended targets,

14:23.396 --> 14:26.898
   Tory will use a device known
     as a down-hole gyroscope

14:27.000 --> 14:29.834
        in order to gauge
      how plumb or straight

14:29.936 --> 14:32.770
         the borehole is
        from the surface.

14:32.873 --> 14:37.075
  As it descends, a specialized
     microchip sensor inside

14:37.177 --> 14:40.011
       will measure how far
      and in what direction

14:40.113 --> 14:41.980
   each hole may have deviated

14:42.082 --> 14:44.949
    from its starting position
         on the surface.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.553
   CRAIG: When they're putting
        these shafts down,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.788
  they do deviate quite a bit.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.125
    Wells deviate like crazy,
   and the smaller the pipe is,

14:54.227 --> 14:57.228
  like they used many years ago,
     the more it'll deviate.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.799
  So it's confusing, and we need
    to just take all the data

15:01.902 --> 15:05.436
    and determine, you know,
  what is the best possibility

15:05.538 --> 15:07.538
          for Shaft Six.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.374
   I've got the results here,
   if you want to take a look.

15:09.476 --> 15:13.278
             -Okay.
   -So, it went 8.7 feet east.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.848
              -Wow.
      -And four feet north.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.318
  What... and what do you have
       at 100-foot depth?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.755
    Uh, yeah, so at 100 feet,
     it looks like it walked

15:23.857 --> 15:26.691
       about 5.3 feet east

15:26.793 --> 15:29.327
 and two and a half feet north.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.096
   So quite a fair amount more
      than what we've seen

15:32.198 --> 15:34.098
     -in the previous holes.
             -Yeah.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.366
    But at least we'll know,

15:35.468 --> 15:37.168
            you know,
   the direction it was going,

15:37.270 --> 15:39.637
       how far off it was
     at that point in time.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.139
 So that's what you're here for,

15:41.241 --> 15:43.241
         is to find out
       where these are at.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.877
  -And we'll make our decision
         based on that.
          -Sounds good.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.345
  -I'll move to the second one.
             -Okay.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.347
         -Thanks, Craig.
       -Talk to you later.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.116
    NARRATOR: As Tory Martin
       continues to survey

15:52.218 --> 15:54.886
       the team's boreholes
     at the Money Pit site...

15:54.988 --> 15:56.421
              DOUG:
    Oh, wow, the excavation's

15:56.523 --> 15:58.156
      -really coming along.
         -CHARLES: Yeah.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.991
    NARRATOR: ...Doug Crowell
      and Charles Barkhouse

16:00.093 --> 16:02.093
       head to Smith's Cove

16:02.195 --> 16:04.729
             to drain
     the newly excavated area

16:04.831 --> 16:06.864
           surrounding
     the U-shaped structure,

16:06.967 --> 16:09.434
  which has filled in overnight.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.404
        You got to wonder
    what that's for, Charles.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.441
  CHARLES: To me, since there's
  no other structure around it,

16:16.543 --> 16:20.445
   I think this was an attempt
 to try to block off the drains.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.080
              DOUG:
 Well, if this is the cofferdam

16:22.182 --> 16:24.248
           to close in
    those five finger drains,

16:24.351 --> 16:26.417
   -that's almost dead center.
            -I know.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.121
      I'm gonna have to get
     that pump lower once it

16:30.223 --> 16:31.789
    -goes down a little bit.
   -Well, I got boots on here.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.257
          I can get in.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.727
     Charles, you see that?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.862
  Look between those two rocks.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.664
    There's an opening there.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.100
  CHARLES: There is some water
      coming out of there.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.735
              DOUG:
   Well, that's what that 1863

16:43.837 --> 16:46.337
  Yarmouth Herald article said.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.973
  It said it was two flat rocks
    laid together like that.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.975
  Like, almost like a triangle.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.611
              DOUG:
         That's curious.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.879
        That is curious.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.682
            NARRATOR:
    A triangle-shaped opening?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.817
The same shape used to describe

16:59.919 --> 17:04.454
  the stone box drains in 1863?

17:04.557 --> 17:08.326
 DOUG: That looks like the apex
of an opening right there to me.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.194
            CHARLES:
           It-it does.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.430
  We get this down a little bit
 more, maybe we can get in here

17:12.531 --> 17:14.531
    -and take a look at that.
 -Why don't we give Rick a call

17:14.634 --> 17:16.501
     and have him come down
    and have a look at this.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.970
  I think he'd be quite curious
      about this. I agree.

17:19.071 --> 17:21.571
         (line ringing)

17:21.674 --> 17:23.608
    CHARLES: Look at that...
  look at that water, you see?

17:23.710 --> 17:27.178
      It's a steady trickle
      of water coming out.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.113
          -RICK: Hello?
     -Hey, Rick. It's Doug.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.815
 I've got Charles here with me.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.750
   We're down in Smith's Cove.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.053
       We've got a couple
     of curious stones here

17:35.155 --> 17:36.988
 that have an opening in them--
      we thought maybe you

17:37.090 --> 17:39.690
   -should take a look at it.
   -Okay. Yeah, I'll be down.

17:39.793 --> 17:43.394
    The call from Doug was...
       was quite exciting,

17:43.496 --> 17:45.496
   because everyone has thought
       that the box drains

17:45.598 --> 17:47.865
     well and truly existed.

17:47.967 --> 17:51.936
    And for Doug to be excited
       to see that feature,

17:52.038 --> 17:54.939
       obviously necessary
   to go down and investigate.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.508
           Hey, Rick.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.177
              -Hey.
              -Hey.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.914
  DOUG: Over in this wall here,
       there's two stones.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.019
 -Right there. See the opening?
             -Yeah.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.456
      DOUG: Two flat rocks
 laid together like a triangle.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.225
  Hard to imagine Mother Nature
  laid those stones like that.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.060
       Have you seen water

18:16.162 --> 18:17.829
       -come out of there?
       -Yeah, there's been

18:17.931 --> 18:19.964
    a steady trickle of water
  down through that whole area.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.400
     You can see it, see it
  right here over on this side,

18:22.502 --> 18:25.169
        coming right down
  the other side of that rock.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.671
     To me, it looks like...

18:26.773 --> 18:29.474
       -it's a box drain.
             -Yeah.

18:29.576 --> 18:33.945
 -It's hard not to get excited.
          -Absolutely.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.281
              TORY:
     Just a stone by itself,

18:37.383 --> 18:39.117
    and it looks like there's
     some old etching on it.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.053
    DAN H.: I wonder how long
        that's been there.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.688
      This flat edge here,
 that just doesn't seem natural

18:43.790 --> 18:45.690
         to me, anyway.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.596
              RICK:
    That could be a box drain.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.065
  NARRATOR: While investigating
   near the U-shaped structure

18:54.167 --> 18:55.733
        at Smith's Cove...

18:55.835 --> 18:58.035
         Real curious as
 to whether that extends deeper

18:58.138 --> 18:59.670
     and widens as it goes.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.472
         ...Rick Lagina,
        Charles Barkhouse

19:01.574 --> 19:05.376
         and Doug Crowell
   have just made what could be

19:05.478 --> 19:06.944
      a historic discovery:

19:07.046 --> 19:10.381
      evidence of a possible
         stone box drain,

19:10.483 --> 19:13.818
       one of five believed
       to feed ocean water

19:13.920 --> 19:15.453
     deep into the Money Pit

19:15.555 --> 19:19.524
            as part of
an elaborate booby trap system.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.125
     Definitely see a layer.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.327
           -DOUG: Yep.
      -Then another layer.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.730
      You haven't probed it
       or anything, or...?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.198
              DOUG:
               No.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.167
    If that's a flood drain,

19:29.269 --> 19:31.435
   what we might find is signs
   that the rocks were worked

19:31.538 --> 19:33.137
       -to make them fit.
             -Yeah.

19:33.239 --> 19:36.073
      I think what we need
       to do, then, is...

19:36.176 --> 19:39.343
 maybe slowly, gently wash that,
     at least preliminarily.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.711
           All right.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.616
   RICK: If this is a feature
    that was once constructed

19:45.718 --> 19:47.985
      to allow water to pass

19:48.087 --> 19:51.455
        from Smith's Cove
to the depths in the Money Pit,

19:51.558 --> 19:53.057
     it'd be more than huge,

19:53.159 --> 19:55.326
    it'd be the "aha" moment.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.863
              DOUG:
           Gentlemen.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.164
      Hello. How you doing?

20:00.266 --> 20:02.600
            -Morning.
    -Good morning. Hey, Rick.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.402
       DOUG: Between those
     two rocks there, guys,

20:04.504 --> 20:07.838
   you see there's an opening
   like an apex of a triangle.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.840
        That description
    of the old finger drains

20:09.943 --> 20:12.610
           -from 1863.
              -Yes.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.546
      RICK: I thought maybe
 if we just wash it a little bit

20:15.648 --> 20:18.449
 -to try to get the orientation.
        -Certainly. Yep.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.755
   Just curious to how far in
      that opening may go.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.058
              Yeah.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.096
    Of course, the question:

20:32.198 --> 20:35.766
 placed by people or... nature?

20:45.178 --> 20:47.778
            CHARLES:
        Hey, what's this?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.617
  Doug, is this coconut fiber?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.320
        I just pulled it
       out of right here.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.457
   There's a whole bunch of it
         right in here.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.159
      Like, a level of it.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.264
            NARRATOR:
          Coconut fiber?

21:06.366 --> 21:10.134
       When the box drains
  were first discovered in 1850,

21:10.236 --> 21:12.436
         treasure hunters
      from the Truro Company

21:12.538 --> 21:14.538
         reported finding
       the stone structure

21:14.641 --> 21:17.174
        covered by layers
        of coconut fiber,

21:17.277 --> 21:20.478
     which served as a filter
  to prevent debris and sediment

21:20.580 --> 21:23.080
          from clogging
        the flood tunnels.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.883
      Because coconut fiber
          was also found

21:25.985 --> 21:28.653
      in the various layers
    of the original Money Pit,

21:28.755 --> 21:31.289
         and considering
  that the nearest coconut tree

21:31.391 --> 21:34.725
     is more than 1,500 miles
        from Nova Scotia,

21:34.827 --> 21:38.362
   researchers have speculated
  that it was originally brought

21:38.464 --> 21:41.332
         to Oak Island as
  packing material in the cargo

21:41.434 --> 21:45.369
    of the numerous ships that
made their way into Mahone Bay.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.171
  The story of the box drains,

21:47.273 --> 21:49.807
  the story of the flood system
        in Smith's Cove,

21:49.909 --> 21:52.076
       all of it revolves
   around this central issue,

21:52.178 --> 21:54.378
       i.e. coconut fiber,

21:54.480 --> 21:57.682
    massive amounts of coconut
   fiber found in Smith's Cove.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.618
To find that in close proximity
           to the wall

22:00.720 --> 22:03.087
   may indicate original work.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.356
              DOUG:
       That 1863 account,

22:05.458 --> 22:07.358
     it said that the rocks

22:07.460 --> 22:10.094
       that form the drain
  were packed in coconut fiber.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.229
      So, if you're finding
          coconut fiber

22:12.332 --> 22:13.731
         at that level,
   that's really curious, too.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.533
            CHARLES:
         It is curious.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.305
         -Lots of water.
          -RICK: Yeah.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.606
     -Definitely coming out.
   -CHARLES: Look at the water

22:22.709 --> 22:24.709
      -coming out of that.
             -Yeah.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.844
Does that alignment look natural
         to you, Laird?

22:26.946 --> 22:29.513
      No. It actually does
       look strange. Yeah.

22:29.615 --> 22:32.583
       And this certainly
     is not a glacial rock.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.884
      You could ask Terry,

22:33.986 --> 22:36.354
           -but, uh...
     -RICK: In your opinion,

22:36.456 --> 22:38.289
    all the work you've done,
   all the digging you've done

22:38.391 --> 22:39.957
     in the general locale,

22:40.059 --> 22:42.226
  does this look normal to you?

22:42.328 --> 22:46.163
    TERRY: It's a substantial
   conglomeration of boulders

22:46.265 --> 22:48.966
     with very little matrix
          between them.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.302
     If somebody was trying
   to build a drain, this is--

22:51.404 --> 22:54.572
this is the type of construction
         you might see.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.674
       But, uh, you know,

22:56.776 --> 22:59.443
     the-the proof will be,
   you know, as we move back.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.913
      As we follow it back,
   it'll turn into something--

23:03.015 --> 23:04.715
   uh, you know, we should see
         a pattern then,

23:04.817 --> 23:06.817
    uh, that type of a thing,
          going upward.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.252
             Right.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.792
 It seems to be going this way.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.328
        Let's follow it.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.430
   Not only do you have this...

23:19.532 --> 23:20.731
  description in the newspaper,

23:20.833 --> 23:22.733
which we now see in front of us,

23:22.835 --> 23:25.369
     but we have this gate,

23:25.471 --> 23:28.973
           which aligns
   with the U-shaped structure,

23:29.075 --> 23:31.075
           which aligns
       with this construct,

23:31.177 --> 23:32.710
      this stone formation.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.012
   That can't be a coincidence.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.814
       We have to proceed
        very cautiously,

23:36.916 --> 23:38.783
 very slowly, very disciplined,

23:38.885 --> 23:41.252
     because the last thing
          we need to do

23:41.354 --> 23:43.053
   is to be highly disruptive

23:43.156 --> 23:46.657
   in an area that we now find
  so compelling and intriguing.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.626
You got to figure they're moving

23:48.728 --> 23:49.827
    in the general direction
        of the Money Pit,

23:49.929 --> 23:51.262
    if they're what we think
            they are.

23:51.364 --> 23:52.463
         If they're what
       we think they are.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.332
      Why don't we just...

23:55.435 --> 23:57.468
  turn this little mini around.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.437
One or two of us start shoveling

23:59.539 --> 24:01.138
          the majority
     of that material away.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.740
        You know, I think
  you're right, Rick. Let's...

24:02.842 --> 24:04.842
            -track it
   where-where we know it is.
       -RICK: Okay, Billy,

24:04.944 --> 24:06.177
      -you want to hop in,
        scrape that off,
             -Yeah.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.846
          and-and Laird
      can follow behind us.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.183
            NARRATOR:
          Later that day

24:12.285 --> 24:14.852
    and as the team continues
           to excavate

24:14.954 --> 24:17.488
      the possible box drain
        at Smith's Cove...

24:17.590 --> 24:19.123
              TORY:
 There's just a stone by itself,

24:19.225 --> 24:21.725
    and it looks like there's
     some old etching on it.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.227
        -RICK: Down here?
          -TORY: Yeah.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.162
  ...Rick Lagina, Craig Tester,

24:25.264 --> 24:29.066
       and Dan Henskee join
gyroscope operator Tory Martin.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.436
    He has just informed them
     of an unusual discovery

24:32.538 --> 24:34.405
     he made while assembling
          his equipment

24:34.507 --> 24:37.475
          near the woods
    surrounding the Money Pit.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.911
-Okay, let's-let's see this guy.
   -It's just over here, guys.

24:41.013 --> 24:45.683
    DAN H.: I wonder how long
       that's been there.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.118
    TORY: This is what caught
        my eyes, really.

24:48.221 --> 24:49.420
      This flat edge here.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.121
       It seemed like this
  almost looked like it was...

24:51.224 --> 24:52.857
              Cut.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.025
  TORY: That just doesn't seem
     natural to me, anyway.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.494
             CRAIG:
               No.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.396
  I don't know if it's anything
       of interest, but...

24:59.499 --> 25:01.198
     just the way the light
 was shining on it, I was like,

25:01.300 --> 25:03.200
  -"That doesn't look normal."
           -RICK: Hmm.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.469
     -Figured it'd be worth
       mentioning, anyway.
          -Absolutely.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.304
       -And we thank you.
        That's for sure.
     -Appreciate that, yeah.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.939
         RICK: You know,
     when Tory Martin called

25:09.041 --> 25:11.709
        and he mentioned
 that there was a strange stone,

25:11.811 --> 25:14.178
       uh, close proximity
        to the Money Pit,

25:14.280 --> 25:15.880
  well, that's an "aha" moment,
             right?

25:15.982 --> 25:18.148
   We had walked by that stone
           many times,

25:18.251 --> 25:20.117
      and yet it took Tory,

25:20.219 --> 25:22.219
     the fellow from Reflex,

25:22.321 --> 25:24.321
  who is doing the inclinometer
      work in the Money Pit,

25:24.423 --> 25:26.790
   to notice it and to bring it
        to our attention.

25:26.893 --> 25:30.394
     It brings back what Dan
  Blankenship told us long ago:

25:30.496 --> 25:32.363
       keep your eyes open
         on Oak Island.

25:32.465 --> 25:34.865
  It's hard to tell right now,
   but if you put water on it

25:34.967 --> 25:36.634
   and even you run your hands
        along it, but...

25:36.736 --> 25:39.503
    splash some water on it.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.679
              RICK:
     Definitely not natural.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.787
              TORY:
    Splash some water on it.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.455
    NARRATOR: While examining
        a mysterious stone

25:58.558 --> 26:00.891
  found near the Money Pit site,

26:00.993 --> 26:04.528
    Rick Lagina, Craig Tester
         and Dan Henskee,

26:04.630 --> 26:07.331
  along with gyroscope operator
           Tory Martin,

26:07.433 --> 26:10.768
    have just discovered what
appear to be man-made carvings.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.871
   TORY: It just doesn't seem
     natural to me, anyway.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.273
              -No.
    -Definitely not natural.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.942
      Look at that, Craig.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.377
         There's these.
      These raised ridges.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.212
         -CRAIG: Mm-hmm.
        -And then, inside

26:22.315 --> 26:24.148
       the raised ridges,
       are these carvings.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.983
              -See?
           -Oh, yeah.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.285
       There's a carving,
         a raised ridge,

26:28.387 --> 26:30.621
     carving, raised ridge.

26:30.723 --> 26:33.357
  And then there's definitely a
 straight line, as though it's--

26:33.459 --> 26:35.659
         -See that line?
        -CRAIG: Oh, yeah.

26:35.761 --> 26:39.096
 It's not actual letters, is it?

26:39.198 --> 26:41.732
      It's not in a writing

26:41.834 --> 26:43.534
 that we would recognize, but...

26:43.636 --> 26:44.802
   almost like Roman numerals.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.137
            NARRATOR:
         Roman numerals?

26:47.239 --> 26:49.573
   The same kind of characters
         that are carved

26:49.675 --> 26:52.743
    on the mysterious U-shaped
    structure at Smith's Cove?

26:52.845 --> 26:54.979
     Could this strange stone

26:55.081 --> 26:58.115
     found near the Money Pit
    and the U-shaped structure

26:58.217 --> 26:59.083
          be connected?

26:59.185 --> 27:00.250
              RICK:
         When I first saw

27:00.353 --> 27:01.552
  the characters on the stone,

27:01.654 --> 27:02.987
    uh, below the Money Pit,

27:03.089 --> 27:04.488
            I thought
    they were Roman numerals.

27:04.590 --> 27:07.291
       They're very linear
         carved features.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.560
     Uh, very straight lines,
           if you will.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.662
    There's not much curvature
             to the--

27:11.764 --> 27:14.164
        to the orientation
        of the characters.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.767
  You know, that's interesting
       but not definitive.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.136
      Did you flip it over?

27:19.238 --> 27:22.072
     TORY: We just-- we just
  kind of leaned it like this.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.974
              RICK:
   No, there's nothing there.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.110
           But this is
     pretty clean-cut here,

27:26.212 --> 27:27.411
  as though this went further.

27:27.513 --> 27:31.715
  Maybe this is a square here,

27:31.817 --> 27:33.017
            you know?

27:33.119 --> 27:36.286
    Maybe it went like that.

27:36.389 --> 27:37.421
          Interesting.

27:37.523 --> 27:38.889
        Yeah, definitely.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.258
 -Somebody might be able to know
             -Yeah.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.027
         -what that is.
             -Yeah.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.628
        RICK: Hopefully,
     something comes of it.

27:44.730 --> 27:45.763
         I hope so, too.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.431
   -It'd be very interesting.
             -Yeah.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.532
             -Right.
    -I mean, thanks for being

27:48.634 --> 27:50.234
         -so observant.
             -Yeah.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.302
              RICK:
     Certainly worth a look.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.409
      NARRATOR: After a day
   of exciting new discoveries

27:58.511 --> 28:01.679
      both at the Money Pit
       and at Smith's Cove,

28:01.781 --> 28:04.014
      Rick Lagina has asked
        his brother Marty,

28:04.116 --> 28:06.283
       along with geologist
         Terry Matheson,

28:06.385 --> 28:09.086
          to join him at
the Oak Island Research Center,

28:09.188 --> 28:10.721
  where he has set up a meeting

28:10.823 --> 28:13.357
      with island historian
          Paul Troutman.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.125
           -Hi, Paul.
         -How you doing?

28:15.227 --> 28:16.593
    Good. What you got here?

28:16.696 --> 28:18.796
  Who's on your operating table
              here?

28:18.898 --> 28:21.398
    -PAUL: The new stone that
  was found near the Money Pit.
     -MARTY: I know nothing

28:21.500 --> 28:23.834
           about this.
  Somebody explain this to me.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.836
     Tory told me about it,
   but I haven't seen it yet.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.372
          -So that's...
   -Tory brought me down there

28:28.474 --> 28:30.841
           and, uh...

28:30.943 --> 28:32.676
    you know, it was sitting
        by the old well.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.678
    And just in plain sight.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.413
             And...

28:36.515 --> 28:39.717
      you know, first thing
          you notice is

28:39.819 --> 28:41.185
    -flat-- this flat feature
            -Mm-hmm.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.487
  and then these ridged areas.

28:43.589 --> 28:47.257
        TERRY: Looks like
  a-a metamorphosed graywacke.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.560
 MARTY: And what is a graywacke?
          What's the--

28:49.662 --> 28:50.728
    -what's the composition?
           -It's, uh,

28:50.830 --> 28:52.429
            basically
 the second most common boulder

28:52.531 --> 28:53.831
     we found on the island.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.100
          Most of them
   are rounded, uh, granites.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.068
        For Nova Scotia,
    there's all kinds of it.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.704
      RICK: But, you know,
    upon further inspection,

29:00.806 --> 29:02.339
   we put some water on there.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.442
         And you'll see
     it looks like carvings?

29:05.544 --> 29:06.777
    -Come down here and look.
             -Yeah.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.212
          You see them?

29:08.314 --> 29:09.546
         I just thought
        they were two Hs.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.482
     There was an "H" there
  and an "H" there, I thought.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.816
        Now they're gone.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.585
      Well, uh, right here,

29:14.687 --> 29:16.553
        here, here, here,

29:16.655 --> 29:18.355
           here, here,

29:18.457 --> 29:19.857
             -here.
     -MARTY: Anything close

29:19.959 --> 29:22.993
        to the Money Pit
       that is unexplained

29:23.095 --> 29:24.294
    needs to be investigated.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.563
 And this is an unexplained rock

29:26.665 --> 29:28.899
with strange inscriptions on it,

29:29.001 --> 29:31.668
       strange characters,
  found close to the Money Pit.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.303
  Now, then if those characters
          say something,

29:33.405 --> 29:34.471
   it could be a breakthrough.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.741
Well, here's my question, Terry.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.276
          Do you think
     this could be natural?

29:40.446 --> 29:41.979
             TERRY:
            Natural?

29:42.081 --> 29:44.148
I mean, this one, in particular,

29:44.250 --> 29:45.916
      looks like it's cut.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.918
    And then that looks like,
   I would have thought, maybe

29:48.020 --> 29:49.686
    chiseled, as-- seems like

29:49.789 --> 29:50.854
 it might be a decorative piece

29:50.956 --> 29:53.724
       at the base of a--
      of a building block.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.197
      It almost looks like
 it's underlined from this side.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.966
And that is s-such an appearance
       of being patterned

30:03.068 --> 30:06.537
     or just randomly, not--
      semi-randomly struck,

30:06.639 --> 30:09.339
      as in semi-decorative
      or decorative stone.

30:09.441 --> 30:13.610
 Got some kind of a-a relatively
     flat-ish surface here,

30:13.712 --> 30:16.113
    which really gives me the
 impression that it was worked.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.714
    MARTY: Well, I don't know
         what it means.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.650
       But it's, uh, odd.

30:19.752 --> 30:21.518
           Nice find.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.687
   Yeah, we should probably do
 a laser scanning of this, too.

30:23.789 --> 30:26.924
  There's a 3-D mesh technology
      we can apply for this

30:27.026 --> 30:28.525
       -and, uh, bring up,
       -Without question.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.828
     possibly, through, um,
     raising up the letters,

30:30.930 --> 30:32.296
     -to be able to make out
          any details.
             -Yeah.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.263
      The exact same we did
          on the stone

30:33.365 --> 30:34.298
   from the bookstore, right?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.566
        -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
             -Yeah.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.401
        But bottom line,

30:37.503 --> 30:38.836
          not natural.
        Man-made, right?

30:38.938 --> 30:40.604
  Y-Yes, I would-- I would say,

30:40.706 --> 30:43.974
     on balance of evidence,
        it seems to be...

30:44.076 --> 30:45.442
         touched by man.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.879
 -MARTY: Okay. Here's the thing.
             -Yeah.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.814
       Here's the summary:
            it's odd,

30:50.916 --> 30:52.783
        it's interesting,

30:52.885 --> 30:55.586
   it's mysterious, and it was
    found near the Money Pit,

30:55.688 --> 30:56.920
           which means
       we got to chase it.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.357
     Which means, you know,
    let's find a expert in...

31:00.459 --> 31:02.793
     -PAUL: Languages. Yeah.
 -...languages. Carved languages

31:02.895 --> 31:03.927
          -or whatever.
        -Ancient script.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.095
         Ancient script.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.198
 Things what are normally carved
            on stone.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.167
     See what it might mean.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.969
     -Alright, great, guys.
           Very cool.
             -Okay.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.837
           Very cool.
    Let's keep finding stuff.

31:13.939 --> 31:16.473
   Let's, uh-- let's get back
   out there and get to work.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.279
       DOUG: We're hoping
  your technology might help us

31:22.381 --> 31:24.248
    -figure out what that is.
          -Absolutely.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.817
    DOUG: There you go, Paul.
It's going across the stone now.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.653
              PAUL:
        Oh, look at that.

31:35.027 --> 31:38.262
  NARRATOR: As Rick Lagina and
   members of the team continue

31:38.364 --> 31:40.197
   to uncover what they believe
             could be

31:40.299 --> 31:43.333
a potentially ancient box drain
        at Smith's Cove...

31:43.435 --> 31:46.570
              DOUG:
  This was found near the well.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.372
     ...Oak Island historians
           Doug Crowell

31:48.474 --> 31:51.842
     and Paul Troutman gather
     at the research center.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.944
  That one's really worn away.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.747
       That's where I hope
  the-the guys from Azimuth can

31:56.849 --> 31:58.282
       apply their lidar.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.485
 I know Rick's really intrigued

32:01.587 --> 32:03.954
        -by this stone--
     Hey, guys, come on in.
           -(knocking)

32:04.056 --> 32:06.423
       -Hi. How you doing?
       -DOUG: How are you?
           -Hey, Rob.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.558
        -Good to see you.
   -They are meeting once again

32:08.661 --> 32:11.028
         with Rob Hyslop
        and Ryan Levangie

32:11.130 --> 32:12.963
    of Azimuth Consulting Ltd.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.799
       to have them examine
   the mysterious carved stone

32:15.901 --> 32:18.568
         the team located
       near the Money Pit.

32:18.671 --> 32:21.138
       Just two weeks ago,

32:21.240 --> 32:23.640
      Rob and Ryan conducted
    a comprehensive laser scan

32:23.742 --> 32:25.976
          of an artifact
        the team believes

32:26.078 --> 32:28.879
      could be the legendary
          90 Foot Stone.

32:28.981 --> 32:31.515
        ROB: We collected
      40.5 million points.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.117
        There we have it.
    There's our stone in 3-D.

32:34.219 --> 32:35.919
              JACK:
         That's amazing.

32:36.021 --> 32:38.288
            NARRATOR:
    Using the data collected,

32:38.390 --> 32:40.691
    Rob and Ryan were able to
     enhance the images taken

32:40.793 --> 32:43.460
     of the stone's surface,
        revealing details

32:43.562 --> 32:46.897
    not previously visible to
          the naked eye.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.932
     We've got another stone
       for you to look at.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.367
           Very good.
      What do we have here?

32:50.469 --> 32:52.002
              DOUG:
   There seems to be a pattern

32:52.104 --> 32:53.637
   running right across here.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.605
      But we can't make out
        what it might be.

32:55.708 --> 32:59.242
  PAUL: It's all, uh, vertical
    striations into the rock.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.311
     DOUG: We're hoping your
    technology might help us

33:01.413 --> 33:03.146
    -figure out what that is.
          -Absolutely.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.215
   We'll, uh, we'll make this
      our focus area then.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.384
 -DOUG: That's our primary, yep.
       -PAUL: Okay, cool.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.819
      Let's, uh, get set up
       with you guys here.

33:08.921 --> 33:10.020
     Very good, we'll go out
        and get our gear.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.154
         Okay, awesome.

33:12.925 --> 33:15.759
  NARRATOR: Using a Trimble CX
      scanner, Rob and Ryan

33:15.861 --> 33:20.497
  will now survey the stone for
  any hidden clues or markings.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.233
       By emitting a series
      of rapid laser pulses,

33:23.335 --> 33:24.935
     and measuring the light

33:25.037 --> 33:27.404
        as it reflects off
      the object's surface,

33:27.506 --> 33:30.374
     the device will be able
     to simultaneously record

33:30.476 --> 33:33.777
      66,000 points of data
           per second.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.279
  These scans will then be used
           to generate

33:36.382 --> 33:38.382
       a three-dimensional
         computer model,

33:38.484 --> 33:41.318
    allowing any fine details
      captured in the image

33:41.420 --> 33:43.453
    to be digitally enhanced.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.989
  Now, it'll be easy to define
     these with the scanner,

33:46.091 --> 33:48.058
  and, uh, we should be able to
  look at it from a perspective

33:48.160 --> 33:51.328
 that, hopefully, we can extract
 any kind of geometry from this,

33:51.430 --> 33:53.764
    see if they're letters or
 inscriptions or what they are.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.432
  So, for this, I'd like to put
     a little bit of powder

33:55.534 --> 33:57.200
         on the surface,
  just of our area of interest,

33:57.302 --> 33:58.668
     just to brighten it up.

33:58.771 --> 34:00.337
   We'll try to put it across
         the entire face

34:00.439 --> 34:02.406
 just to make sure we can gather
    as much data as possible.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.307
          By all means.

34:04.410 --> 34:07.444
 DOUG: So the guys from Azimuth,
   they suggested that perhaps

34:07.546 --> 34:09.179
     we use talcum powder on
    the surface of the stone.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.982
  By lightly coating the surface
           of the stone

34:12.083 --> 34:14.918
     with the talcum powder,
  it increases the reflectivity,

34:15.020 --> 34:17.521
   and it gives a better image
          to the laser.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.855
     So I think that's good
          for coverage.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.125
       Um, start the scan.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.795
              DOUG:
       There you go, Paul.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.929
It's going across the stone now.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.799
              PAUL:
        Oh, look at that.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.975
              ROB:
  Okay, so we're all finished.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.143
    -Eager to see this, Doug.
            -Mm-hmm.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.114
  DOUG: Yeah, I'm very excited.
      I mean, there's a lot

34:44.216 --> 34:45.415
   of technology being brought
       to bear this year.

34:45.516 --> 34:46.882
   And I hope it gives us data

34:46.985 --> 34:48.819
   that we're going to be able

34:48.920 --> 34:52.688
    to data mine, if you will,
      and apply to the hunt.

34:52.791 --> 34:57.461
  Now we're gonna zoom in here,
  and try to isolate the stone.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.733
      So there's our stone.

35:03.836 --> 35:05.435
 PAUL: So what we're looking at
           right here

35:05.537 --> 35:07.204
    is just kind of a preview
         of the points,

35:07.306 --> 35:10.006
            and, uh,
   as it gets rendered later,

35:10.109 --> 35:11.975
  you'll have more, uh, detail?

35:12.077 --> 35:14.244
   Yes, but it looks here that
    we've got great coverage

35:14.346 --> 35:16.246
    -on the top of the stone.
        -PAUL: Oh, yeah,

35:16.348 --> 35:17.714
 -there's markings right there.
   -ROB: We can certainly see

35:17.816 --> 35:21.151
          -undulations
    all throughout the face.
           -Oh, yeah.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.787
 Once we get this base data, we
 can manipulate it in many ways.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.523
    We'd like to extract this
         specific area,

35:26.625 --> 35:28.325
  and see if we can vertically
         exaggerate it,

35:28.427 --> 35:30.327
   get more detail out of it.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.762
Yeah, that'd be perfect; that's,
    uh, exactly what we need.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.397
            NARRATOR:
      Now that Rob and Ryan

35:34.500 --> 35:36.399
     have taken scans of the
        mysterious stone,

35:36.502 --> 35:39.136
          they will need
       to process the data

35:39.238 --> 35:41.671
       before they can make
    any kind of determination

35:41.773 --> 35:44.908
  of what the characters carved
          on it may be.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.910
   Thank you very much, guys.
    We hope to see you soon.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.512
     -Thank you, Rob. Ryan.
   -Thanks again, Paul. Doug.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.747
              DOUG:
          See you soon.

35:55.521 --> 35:59.656
NARRATOR: As the team awaits the
results of the laser scan taken

35:59.758 --> 36:01.591
     of the mysterious carved
             stone...

36:01.693 --> 36:04.728
 RICK: That triangle rock shape
     was a tremendous find.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.165
    NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina
    and Craig Tester check on

36:08.267 --> 36:11.434
  the progress of their massive
   excavation at Smith's Cove.

36:11.537 --> 36:14.237
  You'll probably be interested
  since you haven't been here,

36:14.339 --> 36:16.239
you'll probably want to put eyes
         on the drains.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.809
       -We're peeling off
        a foot at a time,
            -Mm-hmm.

36:19.912 --> 36:21.511
   working our way northwest.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.247
   NARRATOR: After discovering
        what they believe

36:24.349 --> 36:27.517
     to be the remains of one
    of five stone box drains,

36:27.619 --> 36:31.621
   the Oak Island team is eager
    to continue their search,

36:31.723 --> 36:33.590
       in hopes of finding
         a direct pathway

36:33.692 --> 36:37.827
       between Smith's Cove
   and the original Money Pit.

36:37.930 --> 36:39.296
              RICK:
         So you can see,

36:39.398 --> 36:41.464
  here's where the points are.

36:41.567 --> 36:45.368
     Uh, so here's the, uh,

36:45.470 --> 36:48.038
    convergence of the drains
   according to the Restalls.

36:48.140 --> 36:51.942
             -Okay.
       -And if you see...

36:52.044 --> 36:54.911
      it's lying like this.

36:55.013 --> 36:58.148
       The wall, the gap.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.650
 -CRAIG: Oh, the triangle? Yeah.
      -RICK: The triangle.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.953
         And this, yeah.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.222
          That is odd.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.090
         I can't figure
      what that wall's for.

37:07.192 --> 37:09.793
  RICK: So, anyway, the idea is
       to keep excavating,

37:09.895 --> 37:11.761
   it'll slowly pull this way.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.698
    There's a lot of material
  to go yet, but we'll dig down

37:14.800 --> 37:16.366
-for sure and see if we find it.
              -Yep.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.168
 Just when we dig, we got to be
        a little careful.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.036
          -That's all.
             -Okay.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.084
 TERRY: The cover over the rocks
          and boulders

37:34.186 --> 37:35.685
 seems to be fairly regular sand

37:35.787 --> 37:37.654
 and then when you hit the black
    sand, I'm thinking maybe

37:37.756 --> 37:41.291
  that seems to be-- Oh, whoa.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.726
 Yeah, that could be something.

37:47.299 --> 37:50.233
             CRAIG:
   Maybe hit an organic layer.

37:50.335 --> 37:52.102
          I don't know.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.070
    It's definitely different
    though, that's for sure.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.206
    TERRY: Looks like we have
     something there, Rick.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.846
  Yeah, okay. That's some kind
         of a structure.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.650
   Completely boulder-ridden.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.451
   It'd be interesting to see
        if it continues.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.453
              RICK:
       Well, it's to here.

38:10.555 --> 38:11.955
       -To here, for sure.
          -TERRY: Yep.

38:12.057 --> 38:15.125
   That seems right up against
           some wood.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.962
            NARRATOR:
      Have Rick and the team

38:19.064 --> 38:21.598
        just found another
        man-made structure

38:21.700 --> 38:23.667
   buried beneath Smith's Cove?

38:23.769 --> 38:25.568
       If so, who built it?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.804
      And for what purpose?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.940
       But I've definitely
         hit wood here.

38:31.043 --> 38:32.142
     So I think if you just
          start there.

38:32.244 --> 38:33.376
            -Start...
           -Pull this?

38:33.478 --> 38:34.844
              Yep.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.292

           You got it.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.105
     You got a couple boards
         going this way.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.107
 Well, they're like this, but...

39:07.245 --> 39:10.947
    You got three boards, but
 here's, here's the biggest one.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.318
      It's a wedged bottom.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.519
             It is?

39:16.621 --> 39:19.155
            -See it?
           -Oh, yeah.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.392
    And then right behind it
      is just solid rocks.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.194
             TERRY:
              Yeah.

39:24.296 --> 39:27.130
     Is that just a one-off
  or do the boards go that way?

39:27.232 --> 39:30.367
   This is the last one I see,
           right here.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.307
    TERRY: Interesting to get
   a piece of wood, hopefully,

39:37.409 --> 39:38.975
to tie the whole thing together.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.410
   In the same phase of work,
            perhaps.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.945
  Thing is, is that, you know,

39:42.047 --> 39:44.981
       they're all roughly
      the same size stone.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.151
       -Is that... normal?
           -Mm. Uh...

39:48.253 --> 39:49.919
        I mean, look at,
    look at this pile, right?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.888
     -I mean, they're all...
          -No, I know.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.557
         -...that size.
      -Yeah, it's a little
          tantalizing.

39:54.659 --> 39:57.127
      -They're all about--
       easily manhandled.
             -Yeah.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.562
  Men and Mother Nature can do

39:59.664 --> 40:02.098
      some similar things,
       but not everything.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.769
     RICK: Whoever did this
      went to a lot of work.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.138
I'm wondering, as we expose it,

40:08.240 --> 40:09.739
   was it an aborted attempt?

40:09.841 --> 40:11.307
    Was it just too much work

40:11.410 --> 40:13.543
       for the result that
      they were attaining?

40:13.645 --> 40:16.312
       This is going to be
  a very interesting enterprise

40:16.415 --> 40:19.916
    trying to figure out what
    the structure represents.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.951
    Do you want to go deeper
     just in that one spot?

40:22.053 --> 40:23.887
        I'd like to see--
    I'd like to see if we hit

40:23.989 --> 40:25.355
    that modern sea horizon.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.123
      Because then you know

40:27.225 --> 40:28.391
  that there's nothing going on
           beneath it.

40:28.493 --> 40:29.793
       When you hit that,
      and it's undisturbed,

40:29.895 --> 40:33.029
     then you know nothing's
      happened beneath it.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.098
        (wind whistling)

40:36.568 --> 40:39.736
    NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
         and their team,

40:39.838 --> 40:42.572
     recent discoveries near
        the Money Pit site

40:42.674 --> 40:44.340
       and at Smith's Cove,

40:44.443 --> 40:46.943
         may soon provide
        significant clues.

40:47.045 --> 40:51.080
     But will they lead to an
       incredible treasure?

40:51.183 --> 40:54.017
    Or are they merely decoys,

40:54.119 --> 40:57.720
    intended to confound those
    who come searching for it?

40:57.823 --> 41:01.224
      One thing is certain.

41:01.326 --> 41:03.827
      Marty and Rick Lagina
        are not giving up

41:03.929 --> 41:05.929
       until the last piece
      of the puzzle is found

41:06.031 --> 41:09.098
      and fitted into place.

41:09.201 --> 41:13.369
   For them and their partners,

41:13.472 --> 41:16.339
   the answer to the Oak Island
    mystery still lies hidden,

41:16.441 --> 41:19.108
     not only in the objects
       they've discovered,

41:19.211 --> 41:22.712
           but in those
      that still lie buried

41:22.814 --> 41:25.114
       waiting to be found.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.752
           Next time on
   The Curse of Oak Island...

41:29.855 --> 41:32.355
   -MARTY: Lookie here, David.
         The oscillator.
           -DAVE: Yep.

41:32.457 --> 41:33.690
     -So, boys, we're here.
        -Make some hole.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.658
              ROB:
 There's some peculiar markings.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.293
     -It's a runic language.
      -This is the Vikings.

41:37.395 --> 41:38.761
  RICK: We're finding structure
         after structure

41:38.864 --> 41:40.563
        -in Smith's Cove.
     -That's the end of it,

41:40.665 --> 41:42.332
          -right there!
   -There's another wall here.

41:42.434 --> 41:44.334
      Ooh! Check this out.

41:44.436 --> 41:46.936
     This could be a friend
          of the cross.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.938
         Has that got--
    it's got a design on it.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.907
             MARTY:
       Okay, are we ready?

41:51.009 --> 41:53.343
      The real treasure hunt
   actually begins, again. Now.

41:53.445 --> 41:54.644
     -RICK: The hunt is on.
       -MARTY: Here we go!
