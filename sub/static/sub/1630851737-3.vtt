WEBVTT

00:09.000 --> 00:10.166
Cha-chung!

00:40.708 --> 00:41.958
Hola, chicos.

00:42.541 --> 00:44.166
Oh, buenos días, Gran Bruja!

00:45.458 --> 00:47.458
-Did you find him?

00:48.333 --> 00:50.250
Ay, where is he?

00:58.166 --> 01:00.041
Papi, you're late.

01:00.125 --> 01:03.125
Never. I just like
making humble little entrances.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.708
-Welcome, parents,

01:05.791 --> 01:07.791
-to our magic talent show!
-Ooh!

01:07.875 --> 01:10.500
-I am the Gran Brujo.

01:10.583 --> 01:13.583
And this is my staff, Estefan.

01:14.541 --> 01:20.166
And this amazing witch is my assistant
and my daughter, the Gran Bruja.

01:22.291 --> 01:27.458
Your young wizards have been working
diligently to perfect their spells.

01:27.541 --> 01:30.291
So, without further delay, vamos!

01:31.333 --> 01:32.833
-Extendenae!

01:33.375 --> 01:35.791
-Super mango!

01:36.791 --> 01:40.875
-Cacao beans, transformatio!

01:45.500 --> 01:49.125
-Ad Vitam y dale!

01:49.833 --> 01:51.833
-Ah yeah!

01:51.916 --> 01:55.833
And our last young wizard is Rico!

02:03.625 --> 02:04.583
You can do this.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.750
-You can do this. You can do this.

02:10.833 --> 02:14.208
Oh my. That's the child
that used Peasant Magic to get in.

02:14.291 --> 02:15.958
Easy, easy. Look at him.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.500
He's just a poor orphan.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.458
This is a school, not a charity.

02:35.916 --> 02:38.500
-I don't belong here.

02:38.583 --> 02:39.750
Rico! Stop!

02:41.083 --> 02:42.666
Hey! Let me go.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.666
Mijo, what's wrong?

02:48.750 --> 02:51.916
I don't want--
I don't want to be-- be here.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.708
-You don't… …belong here.

02:57.208 --> 02:59.375
-Silencio, Tabitha.

03:00.875 --> 03:03.291
Sorry, Gran Brujo.

03:05.041 --> 03:06.916
Anyone have anything else to add?

03:08.500 --> 03:12.041
Rico, look at me. You belong here.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.958
But-- But-- But… I'm different.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.875
And that's what makes you special.

03:17.958 --> 03:21.958
I see you, mijo.
And one day, mark my words,

03:22.041 --> 03:25.375
you will be the greatest wizard
who ever lived.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.666
-Greater than you?

03:27.750 --> 03:31.750
This power in you can be great
or it can be dangerous.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.833
You just need to believe in yourself
as much as I believe in you.

03:38.416 --> 03:40.958
-Ready, gallito?
-Sí, Gran Brujo.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.083
Please, get his wand, old friend.

03:45.583 --> 03:46.875
Gracias, Estefan.

03:52.333 --> 03:57.750
Today, I will be demon--
demonstrate a disappearing spell.

03:59.666 --> 04:01.708
You can do this.

04:01.791 --> 04:04.541
Dissipati peribunt!

04:05.541 --> 04:08.041
Dissipati peribunt!

04:08.125 --> 04:12.041
-Dissipati peribunt!

04:12.125 --> 04:14.958
-I did it, Gran Brujo!

04:15.625 --> 04:16.500
Huh?

04:18.375 --> 04:20.833
"The greatest wizard
who ever lived."

04:20.916 --> 04:24.250
More like the greatest payaso
that ever lived!

04:26.625 --> 04:28.125
You don't belong here!

04:30.791 --> 04:33.291
Street hechizo
spells your doom.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.583
Swirl around, entonces boom!

04:35.666 --> 04:38.291
Oh my gods! He's unleashing Peasant Magic!

04:38.375 --> 04:39.666
Everyone, get out!

04:39.750 --> 04:41.666
Street hechizo spells your doom.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.375
-Swirl around, entonces boom!

04:44.833 --> 04:47.416
-Street hechizo spells your doom…

04:47.500 --> 04:49.916
Gallito, please, do not lose control!

04:51.875 --> 04:54.041
-Oh no!
-Out of here, everyone!

04:54.625 --> 04:57.500
Help me! Help me, Gran Brujo!

04:58.500 --> 05:01.125
-Mija, get everyone out!
-Papi, be careful!

05:02.208 --> 05:04.958
-Hang on, Rico!

05:05.041 --> 05:08.541
Street hechizo spells your doom.
Swirl around…

05:10.541 --> 05:15.166
-Now, please.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.708
-Let's get out of here!

05:17.791 --> 05:19.791
Everyone out!

05:23.958 --> 05:25.875
Papi, get out of there!

05:35.541 --> 05:38.000
-I-- I'm sorry.

05:38.916 --> 05:40.500
G-- Gran Brujo…

05:40.583 --> 05:42.625
-It's okay, gallito.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.541
What have you done, boy?

05:48.541 --> 05:49.791
I'll get the healers.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.500
What's done is done, mija.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.416
Rico, your journey has just begun.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.000
What are you doing, Papi?

05:59.166 --> 06:00.000
No.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.041
No, don't go.

06:02.125 --> 06:05.083
Estefan will help you to your destiny.

06:05.166 --> 06:09.000
-But you must find the way yourself.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.791
I-- I-- I don't understand.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.583
I love you, petite femme.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.500
-We shall meet again.
-No, Papa.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.416
-Please…

06:21.041 --> 06:23.791
…for me, protect each other.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.250
-Get away from him.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.375
Now!

06:50.791 --> 06:52.833
The Teca prophecy was wrong.

06:54.416 --> 06:56.000
We are the prophecy.

06:56.625 --> 07:00.541
And you, Gran Bruja,
are the Great Rooster Wizard I seek.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.166
-No, wait! I am!

07:04.250 --> 07:07.250
I am! I'm the Great Eagle Warrior.

07:07.333 --> 07:08.708
What is so funny?

07:11.625 --> 07:13.375
-I don't have time for this!

07:15.583 --> 07:18.916
Now, come with me
to destroy the Divine Gate

07:19.000 --> 07:20.666
and save the world,

07:20.750 --> 07:22.875
or stay here like a coward!

07:27.833 --> 07:30.708
-You Tecas, you thought you knew

07:30.791 --> 07:32.958
-the meaning of the prophecy.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.583
-You were wrong!

07:36.250 --> 07:37.666
-So now,

07:37.750 --> 07:41.083
you come to my kingdom, disrespect me,

07:41.166 --> 07:45.083
and demand that I join your
ridiculous quest to save the world.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.000
Yes, but--

07:46.083 --> 07:49.375
A world made unsafe
by your father's indiscretion

07:49.458 --> 07:53.833
and your family's declaration of war
on the god of war.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.625
-Well, guess what?

07:57.708 --> 08:02.208
Lord Mictlan is guaranteed to be
better at war than you

08:02.291 --> 08:05.583
-because he is the god of war.

08:05.666 --> 08:09.083
Child, this may come as a shock to you,

08:09.166 --> 08:14.166
but Luna Island does not exist
solely to clean up Teca's messes.

08:15.041 --> 08:20.416
So will I, the Gran Bruja,
join your misguided quest?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.375
-No!

08:28.250 --> 08:33.041
-For me, protect each other.
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.791
-Princess Maya,

08:34.875 --> 08:40.833
there is a young wizard my father once
called the greatest wizard who ever lived.

08:40.916 --> 08:42.708
Oh, where can I find her?

08:42.791 --> 08:45.791
I haven't spoken to him
in some time,

08:45.875 --> 08:49.666
but… I hear he lives
near the Luna Island Academy.

08:49.750 --> 08:52.458
-Gracias, Gran Bruja.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.666
-Ah!

08:57.750 --> 08:59.916
I-- I wasn't listening!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.666
Oh, hey, girl.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.416
Ugh, you again. What?

09:04.500 --> 09:08.208
-Wanna hustle me out of more gold coins?
-Wait. Where you goin'?

09:08.291 --> 09:09.708
None of your business.

09:09.791 --> 09:13.083
You're in luck. I've been to
Nanoyobusness many times.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.458
-I will take you there--
-No. Now go away.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.875
-Uh, you're gonna need a guide.
-What?

09:19.958 --> 09:22.208
You sure you don't need my help, Princesa?

09:22.291 --> 09:25.416
-What did you just call me?
-Snooty. Know-it-all.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.875
No. I meant just now.

09:26.958 --> 09:27.875
Princesa.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.458
Never call me that again.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.000
Hey, if the crown fits.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.416
Never! Now, I'm busy. Leave me alone.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.375
Dang! You are cold!

09:36.458 --> 09:39.125
I'm missing a leg,
but you're missing a heart.

09:41.750 --> 09:45.208
-And you still need a guide!

09:45.791 --> 09:48.958
-Wait.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.333
-Whoomp, there it is.

09:50.416 --> 09:53.208
Please take me
to the Luna Island Academy.

09:53.791 --> 09:56.458
-Sorry, I can't help you.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.000
Oh, come on.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.666
-I'll give you two coins.
-No.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.166
-Tres?
-Look, I don't want to go there.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.750
-I really need your help.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.416
-Please?

10:13.750 --> 10:14.583
Fine.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.041
-Follow me.

10:18.458 --> 10:24.458
-And this is the Luna Island Academy.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.125
What happened?

10:27.208 --> 10:31.541
Uh… Gran Brujo died here.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.250
-He tried--

10:36.166 --> 10:38.500
A fake missing leg?

10:38.583 --> 10:41.375
My leg! Oh, my leg, it-- it grew back!

10:41.458 --> 10:45.291
It's-- It's a miracle!
Oh my-- Praise the leg gods!

10:45.958 --> 10:49.791
The left and the right. Oh my gods.
Look at this. They're even and everything.

10:49.875 --> 10:52.875
Ugh! You and the Gran Bruja set me up.

10:52.958 --> 10:54.125
Unbelievable!

10:55.708 --> 10:56.833
Say what? Her?

10:57.666 --> 10:58.500
For reals?

11:05.708 --> 11:06.625
Ha ha ha!

11:06.708 --> 11:10.875
Very funny, Gran Bruja.
You sent me on a wild-goose chase.

11:12.375 --> 11:13.708
Gran Bruja?

11:13.791 --> 11:15.666
Where did everybody go?

11:15.750 --> 11:18.750
I will show you.
Let me make it up to you.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.791
-Oh my gods. You again.

11:21.416 --> 11:23.833
-Look, I'm not giving you any more gold.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.375
-Hey! What was that?
-You'll see.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.250
Huh?

11:34.916 --> 11:36.208
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

11:36.916 --> 11:38.000
Mwah!

11:38.083 --> 11:43.208
-Invisibility spell.
-Seriously, guys? I can see you.

11:43.291 --> 11:45.000
Can you see this?

11:47.708 --> 11:50.750
-Eugh. I wish I can unsee that.

11:50.833 --> 11:53.083
Congratulations, Maya.

11:53.166 --> 11:56.208
You found the vagabond
my father once called

11:56.291 --> 11:59.208
"the greatest wizard who ever lived."

11:59.291 --> 12:00.750
Wait. This guy?

12:00.833 --> 12:03.333
He's like a scarecrow,
but without dignity.

12:03.416 --> 12:05.166
Sorry, can't go.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.500
I promised your father

12:06.583 --> 12:08.583
-I would protect you, Gran Bruja.
-Ha!

12:09.416 --> 12:12.125
-You, protect me? Please.

12:12.208 --> 12:15.291
My father protected me
until you came along.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.416
-Oh no.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.875
Go on this so-called quest, Rico.
Prove my father was not wrong about you.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.750
-Oh, but--

12:25.041 --> 12:29.208
So, since you're
my only choice left, ahem,

12:29.291 --> 12:33.500
Rooster Wizard, will you join my quest
to destroy the Divine Gate?

12:34.083 --> 12:35.833
I…

12:36.500 --> 12:38.125
I see you, mijo.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.958
And one day, mark my words,

12:41.041 --> 12:44.125
you will be the greatest wizard
who ever lived.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.208
Ready, gallito?

12:52.416 --> 12:54.916
I will join your quest, Eagle Warrior.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.083
Oh. You can call me Maya.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.416
-My name is Rico,

12:59.500 --> 13:01.583
and this is my staff, Estefan.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.958
Nice to meet you both. Huh.

13:04.041 --> 13:08.291
Well, we're sure gonna need more help,
and I know just who can help us.

13:08.375 --> 13:12.375
-Ah Puch… Ah Puch!

13:16.958 --> 13:20.708
Um, you sure you know
where you're taking us on this quest?

13:20.791 --> 13:22.833
I always know where I'm going.

13:22.916 --> 13:25.541
But sometimes when I get there,
it's somewhere else.

13:25.625 --> 13:28.416
Besides, Ah Puch helped me
the last time I was lost.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.583
Ah Puch!

13:29.666 --> 13:33.500
Yeah, I'm startin' to think this Ah Puch
character… …doesn't exist.

13:33.583 --> 13:34.708
Aw!

13:34.791 --> 13:38.208
How am I supposed to find
the Jungle Kingdom like this?

13:38.291 --> 13:40.500
-Ha!
-What are you doing?

13:41.666 --> 13:46.041
-You're making fun of me?
-Maya! Maya! Put Estefan down.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.000
Shh!

13:56.416 --> 13:57.250
Huh?

14:12.375 --> 14:14.333
-We're coming, Maya!

14:15.125 --> 14:17.958
-Please don't hurt her!
-Chiapa!

14:19.875 --> 14:20.750
Ya know this beast?

14:21.833 --> 14:23.583
-Oh, oh, we're pals.

14:23.666 --> 14:25.708
Or at least we were

14:25.791 --> 14:29.416
until he left me to fight
a crazy tattoo goddess all by myself.

14:30.416 --> 14:31.750
You should be sorry.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.791
-I forgive you.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.791
Your giant cat
looks delicious.

14:38.875 --> 14:39.958
Aw!

14:41.708 --> 14:42.791
Can we pet him?

14:45.375 --> 14:47.250
-Of course you can pet him.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.875
If you can tell us
how to get to the Jungle Kingdom.

14:50.958 --> 14:51.875
Deal.

14:56.875 --> 15:00.375
Oh my gods. You're so cute.
Yes, you are.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.666
I bet he tastes like kittens.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.916
-Huh?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.500
Uh… The Jungle Kingdom?

15:11.583 --> 15:12.666
It's not far.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.500
Hey, follow us, amigos.

15:18.791 --> 15:21.125
Now we're even for leaving me stranded.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.958
Yep. Exactly where I was going.

15:38.916 --> 15:42.125
They're so fast.
What are these kids eating?

15:42.208 --> 15:44.375
-Probably jaguars!

15:46.291 --> 15:48.791
-That's better.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.916
Catch us if you can!

15:51.416 --> 15:54.500
-Hold on! Wait for us!

16:00.875 --> 16:02.333
Whoa!

16:02.916 --> 16:05.583
Looks like a graveyard of forgotten gods.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.750
Uh, hello? Where are you?

16:11.750 --> 16:14.583
-Ooh.
-Something is not right.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.458
Hoo!

16:17.541 --> 16:20.125
If it is to be, it is up to me.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.333
-Come again?
-It's some--

16:21.416 --> 16:22.541
-Boo!

16:26.500 --> 16:28.875
-We scared you, scaredy-cat!

16:28.958 --> 16:30.708
That is someone else's pee.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.708
You didn't scare me.

16:33.791 --> 16:36.208
Really?
Well, how about this?

16:36.291 --> 16:39.166
-Oh my gods. Here we go again.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.916
Ooh! What are you?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.958
-I am Cabrakan,

16:45.041 --> 16:50.583
the god of earthquakes!

16:50.666 --> 16:55.458
And I am Cipactli,

16:56.291 --> 16:57.916
-the goddess…

16:58.000 --> 17:01.375
…of alligators!

17:01.916 --> 17:04.125
Oh, you're so pretty!

17:04.791 --> 17:08.458
-Okay, now that's definitely my pee.
-Get it together, you two.

17:09.791 --> 17:11.333
The odds are in our favor.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.875
Then again,
I've always preferred a fair fight.

17:18.625 --> 17:21.708
Don't just stand there.
Do magic.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.666
Terebro!

17:31.208 --> 17:35.375
-You can do this, Rooster Wizard.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.791
-Focus. Terebro!

17:41.541 --> 17:43.083
-I hate

17:43.166 --> 17:45.750
-wizards!

17:45.833 --> 17:48.041
Whoa!

17:48.583 --> 17:49.708
That was amazing!

17:49.791 --> 17:51.458
-Rico?

17:51.541 --> 17:53.208
I think I broke my everything.

17:53.291 --> 17:56.083
Wait. You stay right there.
I can handle the other one.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.708
Yeah, right!

17:57.791 --> 18:00.250
-Whoo!

18:00.333 --> 18:02.833
-Not bad, girl.
-What?

18:02.916 --> 18:06.666
Niña, there's no need to fight.
Just come with us.

18:06.750 --> 18:07.916
Never!

18:12.875 --> 18:14.291
Finish her.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.666
-Had enough?
-That's it?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.958
I tried to be nice,

18:19.041 --> 18:23.625
-but now things are about to get ugly.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.833
-Ha ha!

18:35.833 --> 18:37.625
-Ah!

18:39.416 --> 18:42.083
-How about you taste my claw?

18:43.125 --> 18:44.000
Whoo!

18:47.250 --> 18:51.250
-Open the hole, querida!

18:54.375 --> 18:55.666
This is so not good.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.666
Holy cacao! Run!

19:00.291 --> 19:03.041
Heads up, muchachos!

19:13.750 --> 19:16.166
Rico? You alive?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.416
-Estefan! Come to me!

19:26.791 --> 19:30.166
-Come on. Use your magic to get us out.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.750
I can't. I am nothing without Estefan.

19:33.833 --> 19:38.291
What? You're supposed to be
the greatest wizard who ever lived.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.750
Don't you know any other kind of magic?

19:40.833 --> 19:41.666
Yeah.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.833
Peasant Magic.
It's very dangerous.

19:44.916 --> 19:45.916
Who cares?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.333
I do. I could hurt you.

19:48.416 --> 19:51.125
-Those gods can kill us.
-And-- And so can I.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.166
-Ugh.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.208
Then this is it.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.375
This is as far as we're gonna get.

19:58.916 --> 20:00.750
-We lost.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.625
I know how that feels.

20:03.291 --> 20:06.250
Come on.
We'll figure something out, Eagle Warrior.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.958
-Gracias, Rooster Wizard.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.083
This is not the plan, Cabrakan!

20:13.083 --> 20:17.208
-Lord Mictlan commanded us to bring--
-Commanded? We are gods.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.958
Aren't you tired
of being treated like a servant?

20:20.666 --> 20:27.333
Look, maybe the girl can hurt him,
and that's why he fears her.

20:27.416 --> 20:29.000
Don't be a fool.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.416
Fool?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.125
Oh. Oh, ay, ay.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.666
The gods who sacrifice the half-breed

20:34.750 --> 20:38.000
will become the most powerful
in both realms.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.000
And I want that to be us.

20:40.083 --> 20:41.875
But what if it doesn't work?

20:41.958 --> 20:44.583
Lord Mictlan will end us.

20:45.833 --> 20:48.208
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

20:49.333 --> 20:53.458
-Ay, mi amor, Lord Mictlan is too strong.

20:53.541 --> 20:56.500
-And you think I'm weak?

20:56.583 --> 20:58.916
I didn't say you were weak.
Did I say you were weak?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.166
-That didn't come out of my mouth.
-Does this look weak?

21:03.958 --> 21:05.583
This is not weak.

21:10.166 --> 21:11.250
Gracias, Rico.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.500
-Hm. Don't mention it.
-Look.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.000
That's our way out! Come on!

21:17.666 --> 21:22.250
Once I get… …Estefan back,
he'll get us out of here in one piece.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.041
-Oh, they're coming!

21:28.166 --> 21:29.000
-Huh?
-Ah!

21:32.541 --> 21:36.583
-Hey! And where do you think you're going?
-Let me go!

21:36.666 --> 21:37.625
-Maya!

21:37.708 --> 21:41.000
What? Get back down there.

21:43.791 --> 21:45.291
Ese wizard.

21:47.625 --> 21:51.250
I'll be a kinder god
than Lord Mictlan.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.083
-This is for your own good.

21:53.166 --> 21:55.666
For my own good? I'll be dead!

21:56.708 --> 21:59.083
I'll be sure it's quick
and painless, little one.

22:02.666 --> 22:04.416
Do not sacrifice this child.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.708
Li-- Listen to her.
She's making a solid argument.

22:07.791 --> 22:11.708
Lord Mictlan is too powerful.
We cannot hope to defeat him.

22:11.791 --> 22:15.500
Let's bring her to him like we planned!

22:16.083 --> 22:19.375
Wait, what? No! No. Bad argument. Bad!

22:19.458 --> 22:22.875
-Not another word!

22:24.083 --> 22:27.583
I swear, if you do not control your…
…temper…

22:27.666 --> 22:29.541
I will leave you.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.250
Help!

22:40.333 --> 22:41.708
You-- You can do this.

22:41.791 --> 22:44.916
-Mm-hmm. You-- You can do this!

22:45.000 --> 22:50.375
Rise me up, ahora mismo.
No more fear, ya estoy listo!

22:50.458 --> 22:53.708
-Ah! Why is this not working?

22:54.875 --> 22:57.041
Hold on, Maya!

23:00.291 --> 23:02.000
Rico!

23:02.708 --> 23:05.333
-Enough!
-Hey, what was your name again?

23:05.416 --> 23:06.500
ChupacaBrian?

23:06.583 --> 23:08.791
It's Cabrakan!

23:11.125 --> 23:13.375
Oh, and you're the god of tantrums.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.208
Or the god of terrible husbands?

23:16.291 --> 23:19.791
-I'm the god of earthquakes!

23:31.291 --> 23:33.208
God of earthquakes? Really?

23:35.625 --> 23:38.333
That's kind of… weak.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.458
Weak?!

23:42.583 --> 23:44.083
Ay, not again.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.958
Nobody calls me weak!

23:46.541 --> 23:49.041
Does this look weak to you?

23:49.125 --> 23:52.083
Cabrakan has the power!

23:52.166 --> 23:56.000
-I am hardcore! How do you like me now?

23:56.916 --> 23:59.166
I pity the fool!

23:59.250 --> 24:00.250
See?

24:00.333 --> 24:04.333
Cabrakan is not weak!

24:05.333 --> 24:08.541
-Enough. She is taunting you on purpose!

24:08.625 --> 24:11.458
-She is?
-Come on, Estefan!

24:11.541 --> 24:13.083
-We have to save Maya.
-What?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.083
-You are nothing

24:20.166 --> 24:23.083
without your staff, wizard.

24:24.791 --> 24:28.166
-Please don't hurt him.
-Hurt him like this?

24:28.250 --> 24:32.041
I am the most powerful wizard
in the world.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.583
You can do this, Rico!

24:33.666 --> 24:36.541
-Destrúyelo, just leave dust!
-Huh?

24:36.625 --> 24:37.916
Peasant Magic!

24:38.000 --> 24:40.750
-Aplastalo, and self-combust!

24:49.083 --> 24:50.708
-Huh?

24:53.333 --> 24:58.500
-What have I done?
-You are the worst wizard that ever lived!

25:06.375 --> 25:08.500
-Coming, Rico!
-Huh?

25:17.958 --> 25:20.666
This has gone far enough.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.791
-Rico!

25:23.875 --> 25:25.625
-Maya!

25:25.708 --> 25:27.833
We're gonna come back for you! Don't die!

25:27.916 --> 25:30.750
-No! No, Rico, wait! Ah!

25:39.041 --> 25:40.750
I will never give up.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.583
Come and get some.

25:45.916 --> 25:47.625
I was not expecting that.

25:47.708 --> 25:48.958
Save yourself. Go.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.500
Huh?

25:50.583 --> 25:53.458
-You're really letting me go?

25:53.541 --> 25:56.375
-What? No!

25:56.458 --> 25:59.833
I'm not going to let you sacrifice her.

25:59.916 --> 26:02.125
Lord Mictlan will kill us both.

26:05.708 --> 26:06.958
Go, go!

26:12.166 --> 26:17.625
Here comes Cabrakan!

26:21.500 --> 26:23.875
-Wow!

26:23.958 --> 26:25.083
Jump on!

26:27.000 --> 26:27.833
Thank you.

26:27.916 --> 26:29.916
Whoa, do not thank us yet.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.583
-We're not done here.

26:32.666 --> 26:36.708
Behold the might of Cabrakan!

26:39.541 --> 26:40.833
-Huh?

26:47.125 --> 26:50.250
She is getting away!

27:01.791 --> 27:02.750
Calm down!

27:03.625 --> 27:05.500
Cabrakan, please!

27:09.125 --> 27:10.583
Cabrakan, stop this.

27:14.958 --> 27:16.416
We can't just leave her.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.375
-Can't we?
-If it is to be…

27:19.916 --> 27:21.541
It is up to me.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.291
Rico! Use your magic.

27:28.125 --> 27:31.250
-Dale duro and to the source!

27:31.333 --> 27:34.291
-P'alante, we're the force!

27:35.541 --> 27:38.375
You're doing it, Rico!

27:39.375 --> 27:42.291
What? You think you're big time?

27:42.916 --> 27:45.875
You're gonna die big time!

27:49.541 --> 27:52.666
-You can do this, gallito.

27:52.750 --> 27:55.125
-Street hechizo spells your doom!

27:56.916 --> 27:58.625
-Entonces boom!

28:00.416 --> 28:01.625
What the…

28:04.791 --> 28:05.708
Now, Rico!

28:05.791 --> 28:08.208
-Tadow! How you like me now?

28:09.000 --> 28:09.875
What?

28:15.750 --> 28:19.333
-No!

28:21.416 --> 28:23.541
Cabrakan…

28:23.625 --> 28:25.000
…demands…

28:25.083 --> 28:27.500
-…a rematch!

28:27.583 --> 28:29.416
Over here, headless body.

28:35.458 --> 28:38.708
Wow! Being heroic actually felt good.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.333
She found the Rooster Wizard.

28:46.416 --> 28:48.000
Praise the celestials.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.541
-Almost there.

28:54.125 --> 28:55.750
Are you all right, goddess?

28:55.833 --> 28:59.625
I am now, niños.
Why didn't you go when you had the chance?

28:59.708 --> 29:02.791
You let me go. We couldn't just leave you.

29:02.875 --> 29:06.416
Yeah, there's a word for people
who always do heroic things.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.375
Heroes.

29:07.458 --> 29:09.416
-No. Dead.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.375
Yeah, the word is dead.

29:13.208 --> 29:15.708
If you ever need me,
Maya, I will be there.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.333
Farewell, Princess Teca.

29:21.333 --> 29:22.958
Adios, Cipactli.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.458
Fine. Be that way. But you're missing out.

29:32.541 --> 29:33.666
We should go now.

29:33.750 --> 29:34.583
Um…

29:34.666 --> 29:36.791
Which way to the Jungle Kingdom?

29:36.875 --> 29:41.041
Follow the bees and the sweet scent
of jasmine toward the purple mist.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.250
Head northeast.

29:48.833 --> 29:50.083
-That way.
-Got it.

29:54.041 --> 29:55.916
Gracias, Cipactli!

29:58.916 --> 30:02.000
So, how did you convince
Chiapa to come back?

30:02.083 --> 30:05.541
I-- I cast a courageous
battle cat spell on him.

30:05.625 --> 30:06.791
You did?

30:06.875 --> 30:09.166
Um, there is no such thing.

30:09.250 --> 30:12.666
But he didn't know that.
See? You did it all on your own.

30:12.750 --> 30:15.208
-You a bad gato.

30:17.125 --> 30:21.000
So did you. You fought
by my side even without Estefan.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.916
That was-- That was really brave.

30:24.416 --> 30:25.916
-Gracias.

30:28.708 --> 30:31.625
The Gran Brujo
would have been really proud of me.

30:32.125 --> 30:33.875
-Whoa!

30:33.958 --> 30:34.958
We made it.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.291
Whoa!

30:45.666 --> 30:47.958
Wait. I don't see any guards.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.333
And there they are.

30:54.416 --> 30:57.666
Okay. Why don't you let Ri--

30:57.750 --> 30:59.333
-me handle this.

31:00.708 --> 31:01.750
-Huh?
-Rico?

31:04.291 --> 31:05.125
Rico!

31:07.208 --> 31:10.041
We mean you no harm.

31:11.375 --> 31:13.250
-This is gonna hurt.

31:18.416 --> 31:21.375

Monstruo Blanco!

31:37.250 --> 31:39.291

31:40.000 --> 31:42.833
-mightiest of all barbarians!

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
For Maya!
