KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:05.139 --> 00:08.342
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.278
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.311 --> 00:11.745
and by the time I got here,

00:11.779 --> 00:15.616
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.486
I hid who I really was

00:18.519 --> 00:22.656
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.826
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.530
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.563 --> 00:31.432
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.465 --> 00:34.102
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.606
I am Supergirl.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.341

-WOMAN: Lena Luthor?
-Who are you?

00:51.152 --> 00:54.122
I have a business proposition

We have the hostages, and
we don't want to hurt anyone.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.401
Well, you don't
have to hurt anyone.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.370
No one is making you do this.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.805
You're choosing to do this.

01:11.839 --> 01:15.209
You and your friend
chose to go into that bank.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.811
You chose to take
those people hostage.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.413
But you know what?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.515
You can choose
to put your guns down.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.584
You can choose
to let those people go.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.820
You can choose
not to hurt anyone.

got to meet Supergirl.

It'll be a fun story to tell

02:03.191 --> 02:05.526
Alex, don't be
embarrassed, okay?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.695
The first time
I tried to microwave
macaroni and cheese

02:07.728 --> 02:09.397
they had to evacuate
three city blocks.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.798
That's an exaggeration,

02:10.831 --> 02:15.536
but I have seen less
terrifying nuclear explosions.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.172
Well, I like pizza better
than paella anyway.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.907
-Yes. Me too.
-I love ham and pineapple!

02:19.940 --> 02:22.643
Thank you.
It totally shouldn't work,
but it totally does.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.513
-How's my girlfriend,
guys, huh?
-(LAUGHS) What?

02:25.546 --> 02:28.782
Bank robbers, zero.
Supergirl, two.

02:28.816 --> 02:32.486
What do you even need
cops for in this city?
(LAUGHS)

02:32.520 --> 02:35.456
He's from a different planet.
He doesn't even know
what he's saying.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.492
No, he's right. Why bother
trying to talk a guy down

02:38.526 --> 02:41.295
when Supergirl can just swoop
right in and force him down?

02:41.329 --> 02:44.565
Seventeen hours of
"What do you want,
how can I help you?"

02:44.598 --> 02:47.435
good old-fashioned hostage
negotiation wasted.

02:47.468 --> 02:52.306
You're not upset that I caught
the bad guys and got everyone
out safely, are you?

02:52.340 --> 02:53.941
I would have gotten them
to free the hostages.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.344
Maybe.
But they're in jail now,
where they can't hurt anyone.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.978
That's all that matters.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.248
-As long as they don't use
the Supergirl defense.
-The what?

03:00.281 --> 03:03.317
It's a thing
some criminals use
to get their charges dropped.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.286
It's a perfect storm
for a defense attorney.

03:05.319 --> 03:09.523
Excessive force, evidence
contaminated by debris,
vigilante justice...

03:09.557 --> 03:10.858
KARA: "Vigilante justice"?

03:10.891 --> 03:13.494
I stand for hope,
and help, and compassion!

03:13.527 --> 03:15.463
I did what I had to do to get
those people out of there.

03:15.496 --> 03:19.433
I think what Maggie's
trying to say is that
what you do is amazing

03:19.467 --> 03:21.001
when we're up against...

03:21.034 --> 03:24.272
A giant purple monster
or a half-cyborg murderer,
sure.

03:24.305 --> 03:29.310
But, most of the time,
police work requires
a more delicate touch.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.778
-"Delicate"?
-Yeah.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.980
You broke a guy's arm
and you gave another one
a concussion.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.317
And that was after you
knocked in the roof
of a National City landmark.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.288

it just has a big,
Supergirl-sized hole in it.

could've happened

03:41.855 --> 03:44.825
from the time of your call
to the hostages walking out.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.761
Maybe, yeah, sure,
I broke some walls,

03:47.795 --> 03:51.031
but I got everyone
out of there safely,
and that is a win.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.402
Well, you should've asked.
But you never look
before you leap.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.869
Because I can fly.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.338
(SCOFFS) Okay.

(CLEARS THROAT)

04:00.641 --> 04:03.844
Well, as being something
of a superhero myself,

04:03.877 --> 04:09.683
I can say that sometimes
it's better to punch, than,
than to talk.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.753
Sometimes talking is more
hurtful than punching.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.956
Obviously, I've upset you,
Maggie. I'm gonna go.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.892

at your proposal

05:04.972 --> 05:07.508
and I have never seen
anything like it.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.076
I hope in a good way.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.014
It's astonishing.

Well, I saw your TED Talk
on the future of
quantum technology,

05:17.451 --> 05:20.488
which made me think
it might be right up
your alley.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.424
This could revolutionize
travel, energy,

05:23.457 --> 05:25.393
security, just about anything.

05:25.426 --> 05:29.763
You could move food
and water to famine-stricken
areas in an instant...

05:29.797 --> 05:32.900
And solve climate change.
That is, if it works.

05:32.933 --> 05:37.571
The proposal
you lay out is sound,
but it is all theoretical.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.408
Which is why I need you.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.876
My thought was,
if we wed L-Corp's work

05:42.910 --> 05:46.614
in zero-size intelligence
with my design,

05:46.647 --> 05:49.016
I'm confident we can
make it a reality.

05:49.049 --> 05:53.521
Of course, I kept a few key
details out of the proposal.

05:53.554 --> 05:57.691

interest before revealing
all of my secrets.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.460
-Well, I'm interested.
-Good.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.562

to catch up with you

at yours?

06:25.152 --> 06:27.020

they've kidnapped Alex,

what exactly did they
say on the call?

He said he would kill Alex if
I didn't break Peter Thompson
out of Albatross Bay.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.750
He said he knows
Kara Danvers is Supergirl.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.852
He's targeting Alex
because she's my sister.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.721
This might be
stating the obvious here,

08:40.754 --> 08:42.823
but why don't we just spring
Peter Thompson
and bring Alex home?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.692
The DEO does not
negotiate with terrorists.

we'll open the floodgates.

Supergirl can be controlled.

And even if we do
what he wants,

08:51.231 --> 08:53.200
it doesn't guarantee
he'll release her.

No, it's been offline since

to power it down.

HANK: Where are we
triangulating the signal
from the phone calls?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.783

we gotta move.

All right, let's start
with what we do know.

If this guy knows
you're Supergirl,
we use that to our advantage.

-Lillian Luthor.
-Does Peter Thompson
have ties with Cadmus?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.368
No, I already checked.
There's nothing.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.671
Then you're asking the wrong
question. We don't know
where Alex was taken,

09:30.704 --> 09:33.340
we don't have a crime scene,
we don't have any
physical evidence.

They've clearly been
planning this for a while.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.813
Whoever took Alex
is a ghost who doesn't
want to be found.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.248
Then what's
the right question?

09:41.281 --> 09:44.885
Who is Peter Thompson,
and what does he
mean to our ghost?

09:46.754 --> 09:48.121

of Engineering from MIT.

the compliment.

That's not how
I'd describe her.

10:19.452 --> 10:23.156
Mothers and daughters,
not always the
easiest relationship.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.759
It's more like apocalyptic,

talk about it...

10:27.194 --> 10:28.962
No, no, it's fine.
You know?

10:28.996 --> 10:31.699
She never really cared
about me

10:31.732 --> 10:35.002
and only came back
into my life to steal from me
and frame me for a felony.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.437
So, you know...
Usual mother-daughter stuff.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.809
(LAUGHS) Well, you have
a sense of humor about it.
I'm impressed.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.945

usually successful.

Are you plagued
by your mother, too?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.982
Mmm. My son.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.021
He was always
the light of my life.

10:54.054 --> 10:58.992
But recently,
he met this horrible girl,

11:00.961 --> 11:02.863
and everything changed.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.265
My husband and I

11:07.334 --> 11:08.969
lost our son.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.672
And on the heels of it,
my husband died.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.044
That's awful.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.146
I'm so sorry. (CHUCKLES)

11:19.179 --> 11:20.981
I never open up like this...

11:21.014 --> 11:22.382
Don't be silly. I started it.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.853
I guess since I'm sharing,
I should share everything.

11:25.886 --> 11:30.223
These are the key concepts
I withheld from the proposal.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.894
I can't wait. And I give you
my word, I will not steal it.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.128
I trust you.

11:36.864 --> 11:40.300
You know, regardless of
what happens with business,

11:40.333 --> 11:42.202
I have a feeling
we're gonna be friends.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.906
To new friends!

11:47.074 --> 11:48.942

11:58.318 --> 12:01.288
Mr. Thompson.
Hank Henshaw, FBI.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.991
This is Detective Sawyer
from NCPD,

12:04.024 --> 12:06.459
and Ms. Danvers
from CatCo Magazine.

12:07.327 --> 12:11.098
The feds, a pig, and a journo.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.500
To what do I owe this
confusing pleasure?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.970
Your jacket's
a thrilling read.

12:17.004 --> 12:21.074
Three home invasions,
two DUIs, two counts
of felony murder.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.476
You all didn't come
down here just to
flatter me, did you?

12:23.510 --> 12:26.479
This morning,
we got a call from
an anonymous source,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.782
asking that you be
released from prison.

12:28.816 --> 12:32.252
Someone wants me out of jail?
Not used to that.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.421
People usually want
to keep me behind bars.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.857
A life sentence
can't be all that easy,

12:36.890 --> 12:39.192
being in here all by yourself.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.829
You ever keep in contact
with anyone on the outside?

12:41.862 --> 12:43.997
Just last week,

12:44.031 --> 12:47.234
Mr. JC Penney
sent me a letter.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.903
He said there was
a sale on galoshes.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.504
It's just that I don't have
anywhere to wear them.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.974
KARA: Enough!
My sister's been kidnapped,

12:54.007 --> 12:56.844
and her life is on the line
until we find out who
wants you out of prison.

12:56.877 --> 13:00.447
-Ms. Danvers...
-So save us the sarcasm,
who is it?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.149
-Who has her?
-Calm down.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.817
Who has my sister?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.019
I don't know.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.357
-You're lying.
-He's not. We're done here.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.029
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

13:18.866 --> 13:21.201
-Why'd you let him go?
-Because I read his mind.

13:21.234 --> 13:25.072
-He's telling the truth.
-Losing control is not
gonna help us find Alex.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.106
It's only gonna
get her killed.

-Winn.
-WINN: Hey, we got something.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.213
-What?
-So I scanned the visitor logs
for Peter Thompson

13:33.246 --> 13:35.115
over the past three years.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.984
They're pretty sparse,
except for one name
that keeps popping up.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.252
-Who?
-Doesn't matter,
it's a fake name.

13:39.286 --> 13:43.190
But I pulled security footage
and, baby, I ran that facial
recognition software.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.557
Thompson has a son.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.027
But we checked,
he doesn't have any relations.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.528
WINN: Well, apparently,
there's a lot of family drama.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.298
Thompson's name
isn't even on the kid's
birth certificate.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.434
And I only figured this out
after I cross-checked the name
with the court transcripts.

13:54.467 --> 13:59.639
The kid spoke at Thompson's
sentencing, and his name is...

13:59.672 --> 14:03.043
Rick Malverne. He has a house
an hour outside the city.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.245
Malverne.
Why does that
sound so familiar?

14:05.278 --> 14:06.613
Because he grew up in Midvale.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.354
Alex?

14:15.155 --> 14:16.356
Alex!

14:20.027 --> 14:22.329

14:29.336 --> 14:32.272
Jeez, I haven't seen you
since graduation.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.506
You look great.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.409
Where's my sister?

14:36.443 --> 14:38.378
You break my father
out of prison yet?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.013
You know I can't do that.

and play nice, Kara?

Alex's bookbag.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.413

had the chicken pox,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.742
I was eating lunch by myself.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.384
I was 14.

the nice house

18:06.286 --> 18:09.222
or the perfect family
that you and your sister had.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.557

18:10.590 --> 18:14.194
You have no idea
what Alex sacrificed for me.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.428
Or what I was going through!

18:15.462 --> 18:18.198
Why, because you had to
hide your superpowers?

18:19.266 --> 18:21.368
I was hiding bruises!

18:21.401 --> 18:25.272
Do you have any idea
what it's like to have your
mother tell you you're garbage

18:25.305 --> 18:26.673

18:27.840 --> 18:31.444

had the wrong opinion?

18:34.581 --> 18:37.817
A dad that my mom
kept from me.

18:37.850 --> 18:42.555
And he saved me from her
and he moved me away
from Midvale.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.357
And even though
he was always struggling,

18:44.391 --> 18:47.160
he always made sure
there was food on the table

18:47.194 --> 18:49.562
and he got me enough
money to go to college.

18:49.596 --> 18:53.166

three years ago, the state
took him away from me.

on Peter Thompson.

-RICK: I mean, that thing...

22:20.106 --> 22:22.909
He couldn't decide
whether to hug me or not.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.512
That's vintage Dad.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.415
What are you talking about?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.983
My father would never be
playing these games.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.585
He'd be wanting to
get the hell away from here

22:32.619 --> 22:35.888
and making sure that
he never went back to prison.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.657
I've been planning this
for a year.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.493
Did you really think
I didn't prepare for you,

22:41.160 --> 22:42.361
Martian?

22:48.535 --> 22:50.036
(SHAPESHIFTING)

22:52.472 --> 22:56.843
You're down to
23 hours and 14 minutes.

22:57.810 --> 22:58.978
And counting.

23:10.657 --> 23:11.824

23:15.928 --> 23:18.865
Okay. No problem.

Come on.

23:56.703 --> 23:57.704
Hell yeah!

23:57.737 --> 23:59.806
(BEEPING)

23:59.839 --> 24:02.842
I just got a software
update request from
one of our trackers.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.778
System's not recognizing
the IP address.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.581
-Looks like a hack.
Should I kill it?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.850
-(BEEPING)
-That's Alex! She, she...

24:10.883 --> 24:13.686
She couldn't get a signal out,
so she wired herself into
the camera.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.055
Which means we only
have to find the location

24:16.088 --> 24:17.590
of the camera's IP address.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.860
Alex, you beautiful human,
this is next level.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.730
Guys! We found Alex.
I found her.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.766
-You did?
-We got a ping from
her subdermal tracker.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.034
She's not far.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.838
Maggie. Winn found Alex.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.039
What? How?

24:33.072 --> 24:34.874
I guess you underestimated
my sister.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.609
Let's go.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.745
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.847
You're delusional.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.049
And the second we get back
here with Alex, you're going
to prison with your dad.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.952
Don't say I didn't warn you.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.027
Watch him.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.730
Hey, stop.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.632
Malverne still thinks
he's in control.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.768
He's not acting like someone
who just lost.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.670
He didn't even flinch.
It's like he expected this.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.305
No, no, we are not
listening to that psycho.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.207
Every minute we wait matters.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.642
I want to get her
as badly as you do,

25:09.676 --> 25:11.544
but we can't punch
our way out of this.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.546
-We gotta get it right.
-If the shoe were
on the other foot,

25:13.580 --> 25:15.615
Alex would already be
out the door. I'm not waiting.

who cares about her.

26:16.843 --> 26:17.844
No!

26:36.796 --> 26:38.898
Where is she?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.901
-I told you not to go there...
-Tell me where she is now!

26:41.934 --> 26:46.172
I gave you 36 hours to break
my father out of prison.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.140
But you didn't listen.

26:48.174 --> 26:52.712
So now, that room
is gonna fill up with water
in less than four hours.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.647
I think it's time
you got moving.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.749
Let me talk to Alex.

-(BEEPS)

27:02.855 --> 27:04.156
Alex!

27:04.190 --> 27:06.926
Kara! I sent out a signal,
I thought you were coming.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.428
He re-routed the IP address.
He sent us somewhere else.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.931
Do you have any idea
where you are?

27:11.964 --> 27:16.368
I was unconscious.
I could be hours away
or I could be in the city.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.070
-I don't know.
-RICK: Alex,

27:18.104 --> 27:20.372
it's Rick.
I don't want to hurt you.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.408
I keep on telling
your sister that.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.244
Tell her to get my father,

27:25.277 --> 27:28.881
and this can all be over.
You can come home
and get dry.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.917
No. Kara, no.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.285
You do not give that terrorist
what he wants.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.954
You cannot let yourself
be blackmailed.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.123
You cannot open yourself up
to that, ever.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.727
Do you understand me?
Supergirl is bigger than me.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.163
-Alex.
-Maggie?

27:44.196 --> 27:47.934
-I'm right here!
-Maggie, I need to
speak to you alone.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.841
Babe, everyone here
is working hard and
we're going to find you.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.343
The water is rising fast
and there are things
that I need to say.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.145
No. Don't start talking
like this is the end.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.480
I don't want it to be,
but in case that it is...

28:01.513 --> 28:02.448
It's not!

28:02.481 --> 28:04.316
You're a badass, Danvers.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.252
And you're gonna figure out
a way to get yourself
out of there

28:06.285 --> 28:08.154
or you're gonna hold on
until I find you.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.090
-Maggie, listen to me, please.
-No.

28:11.123 --> 28:15.762
We just started this,
you and me, and it's
not going to end.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.297
Not today.
Not for a long time.

28:18.330 --> 28:22.201
We just had our
first Valentine's Day and
I wanna do more with you.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.204
I want more firsts.
I want to have
a first vacation.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.239
We haven't even argued about
where we're gonna go yet,

28:27.273 --> 28:30.276
or how to load the dishwasher.

28:30.309 --> 28:34.313
(SNIFFLING) Or what
to name our first dog.
Do you want to get a dog?

28:36.148 --> 28:39.018
Yeah, um...
Let's name her Gertrude.

28:39.051 --> 28:43.189
See, there's a lifetime
of firsts that we're
going to do together.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.959
So, you hold on, okay?
Hold on until I get to you.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.395
You promise. Promise me!

28:50.229 --> 28:51.363

What? Alex!

28:55.201 --> 28:57.904
-(GRUNTS)
-What happened?

28:57.937 --> 29:01.207
I told you not to rush in.
Now you've made things worse.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.975
I did what I thought
was right...

29:03.009 --> 29:04.443
I should have been heard.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.344
I should have
been listened to.
I'm her girlfriend.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.346
I'm her sister!

29:07.379 --> 29:10.817
And you think that trumps me.
That you know what's
right for her. I...

29:10.850 --> 29:13.820
I got her to be herself, Kara.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.255
I have just as much
to lose as you.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.458
You should've listened to me.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.437
I thought I made myself clear.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.840
Our business is done.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.008
Now get out of my office
before I call security.

29:36.042 --> 29:39.278
I'm the one who hasn't
made myself clear, Lena.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.813
And I'm sorry for that.

29:40.847 --> 29:44.016
You're right. I lied to you.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.018
I pretended to be
of this world

29:46.052 --> 29:49.588
but only because
I know how much
your mother loathes aliens.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.924
And I presumed
you'd be the same.

29:51.958 --> 29:55.027
That's what people do
when they hear I'm a Luthor.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.428
They presume.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.298
Everything else
I told you was the truth.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.300
Being betrayed
by your own blood.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.569
There's nothing more painful.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.306
I know you understand that.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.474
What do you want from me?

30:08.507 --> 30:12.444
I want exactly
what I proposed.

30:12.478 --> 30:16.582
I want us
to work together to create
a transmatter portal.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.617
We have them
where I come from.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.922
L-Corp has already built a
large-scale generator ring.

30:22.955 --> 30:26.558
We can easily
adapt it for this.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.428
The portal would help
your planet immensely

30:29.461 --> 30:32.164
and it would help me
get home to mine.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.333
I don't work
with people I can't trust.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.035
I made a mistake.

30:36.068 --> 30:39.906
You are nothing
like your mother.
I see that now.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.509
Please, Lena. Don't let
my one lapse in judgment

30:43.542 --> 30:46.112
keep us from
doing great things.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.515
I'll think about it.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.118
That's all I can ask.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

31:06.265 --> 31:08.667
-Lena.
-LENA: Kara. I'm glad
I caught you. Um...

31:08.700 --> 31:12.538
Can I ask your advice
about something? Someone.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.173
Um...

31:15.174 --> 31:16.408
Now's not a good time.

31:16.442 --> 31:17.676
I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.611
Oh, of course, of course.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.247
Is everything okay?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.549
I'll call you back.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.530
-What are you doing?
-Listening for her.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.170
But I can't hear anything.

31:44.203 --> 31:47.239
I can do all these
incredible things,
but I can't

31:48.274 --> 31:50.642
punch my way out of this,

31:52.078 --> 31:54.680
or fly fast enough
and turn back time...

31:57.216 --> 31:59.451
And now I'm afraid
I'm going to lose the person

31:59.485 --> 32:01.587
that is the
most important to me.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.956
To us, Kara.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.728
Maggie was right.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.731
I shouldn't have rushed in.
I made things worse. I...

32:12.764 --> 32:17.469
Maggie was upset
and she was frustrated
and she lashed out at you.

32:17.503 --> 32:21.307
You only did
what you thought was best
to protect your sister.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.275
No one can blame you for that.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.312
I'm scared.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.647
Hey, come on.

32:31.517 --> 32:32.985
So am I.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.738
Under two hours.

32:52.771 --> 32:55.007
The clock is ticking fast.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.010
I know.

32:58.044 --> 33:01.247
And if it ticks down
completely, we both lose.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.215
And I don't think
you want to lose.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.317
Neither do you.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.522
I was wrong about Kara.

33:10.556 --> 33:14.293
She's too much
of a Girl Scout to do
what I need her to do.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.363
I misjudged her.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.334
But I may have discounted you.

33:23.802 --> 33:27.073
You're a cop. You can just
walk into that prison

33:27.106 --> 33:29.741
and break my father free,
if you want to.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.745
You care for her.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.050
-I've seen that.
-Stalking us.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.052
The way you look at her.

The way your hand touches
her hand when you're
walking down the street.

33:51.363 --> 33:55.434
Love can make
people do things that
they don't normally do.

So, please,

34:01.140 --> 34:05.677

wouldn't want you to do this.

All I care about
is getting her back alive.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.385
You were right, sometimes
words don't work.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.654
Sometimes punching
doesn't either.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.657
She just came from your son.
She was with him all day,

36:31.690 --> 36:35.661
trying to turn him,
make him understand.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.929
You know what kind of words
your son's been using?

36:37.963 --> 36:41.667
Words like "rescue",
and "love".

36:41.700 --> 36:45.304
He says he wants
to rescue you,
like you rescued him.

36:45.337 --> 36:49.408
But if he kills Alex Danvers,
he'll never be rescued.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.544
He'll have to live with that
for the rest of his life.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.746
And that'll be his hell.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.750
Now, you've done a lot
of bad things in your life,

36:58.784 --> 37:01.853
but you've done one thing
you can be proud of.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.456
You were a father.

37:05.591 --> 37:06.958
A good one.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.595
You were there
for your son during
the toughest time of his life,

37:09.628 --> 37:12.398
and that's what you
need to do again now.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.334
If he kills her,

37:15.367 --> 37:19.905
you will have failed
at the one good thing
you've done with your life.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.708
Be a father now.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.246
(GASPING)

37:29.381 --> 37:30.882
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)

37:30.916 --> 37:33.319
(TIMER BEEPING)

37:33.352 --> 37:37.723
-She's out of time.
-Please, is there anywhere
he would have taken her?

37:39.558 --> 37:40.592
There's one place.

37:41.793 --> 37:42.961
(INHALES DEEPLY)

37:56.074 --> 37:58.009
BOTH: Alex!

38:12.824 --> 38:14.860
Alex, Alex!

38:14.893 --> 38:19.465
-(COUGHING)
-Thank God. She's okay.
She's all right.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.700
(GASPING)

38:23.469 --> 38:26.672
-You held on.
-(STAMMERING) I held on.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.641
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

38:43.088 --> 38:44.590
ALEX: Hey, you.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.661
You okay?

38:51.430 --> 38:53.799
Am I okay?
Are you kidding?

38:57.603 --> 39:01.407
That was really clever,
with the whole Navy Seal
thing with your pants.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.609
-What was that?
-(LAUGHING)

39:03.642 --> 39:06.878
Well, I knew I just had to
buy a couple seconds.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.414
I knew you were coming.

39:13.652 --> 39:17.856
-You didn't let me finish
before, but I, um...
-What?

39:17.889 --> 39:20.459
-I just really have to
say it now.
-Alex...

39:20.492 --> 39:22.528
Just... It's okay, it's okay.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.095
(GRUNTS)

39:24.129 --> 39:26.097
(EXHALES HEAVILY) Okay.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.401
Those firsts
that you talked about...

39:31.670 --> 39:34.406
I want to have them
all with you.

39:35.541 --> 39:38.109
I never want to stop
having firsts with you.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.648
I love you, Maggie Sawyer.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.654
I love you, Alex Danvers.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.089
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.769
-She refused to stay in bed.
-(LAUGHS)

40:03.802 --> 40:06.805
-Are you sure
you're all right?
-I'm all right.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.440
I knew you'd be fine.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.676
You did good, Alex.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.646
-You too, Maggie.
-Oh...

40:14.680 --> 40:16.582
Just doing what
you taught me to do.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.186
Oh. You survived.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.589
Oh, you do not
get to talk to her.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.724
What are you
going to do to him?

40:25.757 --> 40:28.960
My job. Protect the identity
of Supergirl and the DEO.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.563
-You're gonna mind-wipe him?
-Do you object?

40:31.597 --> 40:33.865
No. Just... Before you do...

40:34.966 --> 40:36.434
(GRUNTS)

40:38.637 --> 40:39.838
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-(RICK MOANING)

40:39.871 --> 40:41.840
Just make sure
he remembers that.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.475
Will do.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.513
(WINN AND MIKE LAUGHING)

40:47.546 --> 40:50.616
-I need to thank you.
-Thank me? For what?

40:50.649 --> 40:54.753
I was so afraid of losing her
that I wasn't thinking.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.889
-And I almost...
-Yeah, but you did
the right thing.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.492
And that was all you.

41:00.526 --> 41:04.663
All I did was remind you
of everything you've been
telling me the whole time.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.567
You and me made
a pretty good team, didn't we?

41:08.600 --> 41:11.670
Well, we both love her.

41:12.804 --> 41:13.805
Yeah.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.776
What? No, get in here.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.578
(BOTH LAUGHING)

41:21.046 --> 41:24.182
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-Oh, I gotta get this.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.652
Lena, hey. I'm sorry
I couldn't talk earlier.

41:26.685 --> 41:30.656
No, no, it's okay. I was just
calling to check up on you.
You sounded upset.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.257
-It worked out.
-Good.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.125
Hey, brunch next Saturday?
I know a place.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.594
Yeah, that sounds great.

41:35.627 --> 41:38.864
Just, uh, no kale
this time, uh, for real.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.066
Oh, and you called
for some advice?

41:41.099 --> 41:43.234
-Yeah, yeah, I figured it out.
-Okay.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.804
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.708
Ready to change the world?

41:50.308 --> 41:52.644
You have no idea.
