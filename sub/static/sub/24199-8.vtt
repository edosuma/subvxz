00:01.040 --> 00:02.660
<i>Previously on "The Americans"...</i>

00:02.700 --> 00:04.580
Some very powerful people

00:04.610 --> 00:06.160
are out there to get rid of Gorbachev.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.240
We want you to find out
what your wife is doing

00:08.350 --> 00:09.420
and tell us.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.920
And if you have to... stop her.

00:12.150 --> 00:13.780
What do they need the sensor for?

00:14.080 --> 00:15.580
I ca... I can't.

00:16.970 --> 00:20.740
Things are changing
back home. Opening up.

00:20.850 --> 00:23.080
The Americans want us
to be just like them.

00:23.180 --> 00:25.730
I don't want to be like them.

00:26.020 --> 00:28.120
Codename, Harvest.

00:28.180 --> 00:30.050
It's been a gold mine.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.640
We've been getting all sorts
of intel on how he operates.

00:33.110 --> 00:35.390
Now, I know you don't want
to be down here, Stan.

00:35.490 --> 00:37.760
But look what's going on.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.260
You should be here.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.430
One of us is in trouble
in Chicago, Philip.

00:41.530 --> 00:42.930
Someone who's doing his job.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.530
I'm not sure I can accomplish

00:44.580 --> 00:46.890
what I came here for without...

00:46.960 --> 00:48.670
Without what?

00:49.080 --> 00:50.340
Stop, FBI!

00:59.680 --> 01:01.790
I wanted to check on you.

01:01.890 --> 01:04.450
In the garage... your face... I just...

01:41.030 --> 01:42.130
Listen...

01:42.410 --> 01:45.460
I know Chicago was hard.

01:45.670 --> 01:46.710
That's not what I want

01:46.730 --> 01:48.180
- to talk to you about...
- I won't need you again.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.840
- I promise.
- I don't... I don't

01:49.890 --> 01:51.330
care about that, Elizabeth.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.340
But you do.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.770
And I know that you worry.

01:56.140 --> 01:57.740
Don't.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.680
Philip, I know what I'm doing.

02:00.950 --> 02:02.880
Do you?

02:03.550 --> 02:06.470
You're wearing a cyanide pill
around your neck.

02:13.190 --> 02:15.090
I have to tell you something.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.630
Uh...

02:21.840 --> 02:26.200
A while back, someone from home

02:26.530 --> 02:28.130
reached out to me.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.920
What?

02:31.080 --> 02:33.480
I tried to talk to you about it.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.050
When?

02:35.290 --> 02:37.150
A few times.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.350
Who was it?

02:39.420 --> 02:42.020
Some guy, it doesn't matter.

02:42.340 --> 02:44.140
What did he want?

02:46.860 --> 02:50.300
He said there are people at the Centre

02:50.430 --> 02:52.660
who want to get rid of Gorbachev.

02:53.450 --> 02:55.810
He's trying to prevent that.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.280
What does that have to do with you?

03:01.910 --> 03:04.410
He said you met with a general

03:04.480 --> 03:07.940
from the Strategic Rocket Forces
who's a part of it.

03:10.970 --> 03:18.010
He asked me... to tell him...
what you were doing.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.440
And?

03:24.460 --> 03:25.900
I did.

03:34.430 --> 03:36.500
What did you tell him?

03:47.660 --> 03:55.430
I told him...
you were the most dedicated,

03:55.730 --> 03:59.260
loyal person
ever to serve the organization.

04:00.730 --> 04:03.070
I told him about the sensor.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.050
Rennhull.

04:06.370 --> 04:09.070
That you were looking into
one of our negotiators

04:09.100 --> 04:11.160
who you thought was a traitor.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.860
That you were going to Chicago.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.190
So, all those times you were...

04:26.360 --> 04:28.020
You were pretending to be so worried

04:28.040 --> 04:29.346
- about me...
- I wasn't pretending.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.586
You were actually just
getting information.

04:30.610 --> 04:32.770
I was worried about you.
What they were asking you to do.

04:32.790 --> 04:34.060
Go to hell, Philip.

04:35.030 --> 04:37.800
Breland, Rennhull,
that couple with the kid.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.500
It was just one thing after another.

04:40.850 --> 04:43.310
I wasn't sure if you knew
why you were doing any of it.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.690
How long?

04:44.840 --> 04:46.810
How long has this been going on?

04:49.620 --> 04:51.250
A couple months.

04:58.020 --> 05:00.160
You should've told me.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.980
I tried, really.

05:03.260 --> 05:05.500
You love to talk.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.540
If you really wanted to tell me,
you would've done it.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.830
I was trying to help you, us.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.660
- Oh, bullshit.
- You may not agree

05:12.680 --> 05:14.580
with everything that Gorbachev is doing,

05:14.610 --> 05:15.996
but he is trying to make things better.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.800
You lied to me for months
because of Gorbachev?

05:18.820 --> 05:20.676
You've always done exactly
what they tell us to do.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.210
I was trying to get you to think...

05:22.240 --> 05:23.276
- To think?
- To ask questions...

05:23.300 --> 05:24.310
- I think...
- Yeah, to ask questions,

05:24.330 --> 05:25.390
to be a human being about these things.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.610
You don't think I'm a human being?

05:31.060 --> 05:32.920
That's not what I'm saying.

05:36.330 --> 05:38.060
I always...

05:40.070 --> 05:41.930
I would do anything for you.

05:44.170 --> 05:46.360
I did. I just did.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.810
But not anymore.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.350
And you do whatever you want.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.410
But please... some of these things...

05:52.380 --> 05:56.450
We believed in something... so big.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.850
And... they tell us
what to do and we do it,

06:00.950 --> 06:03.120
I get it, that's how it works,

06:03.410 --> 06:05.190
but... we do it.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.360
We do it, not them,

06:08.570 --> 06:11.230
so it's on us...

06:13.370 --> 06:14.730
All of it...

07:06.070 --> 07:07.160
Oh. Thanks, Wendy.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.450
Call you after the meeting?

07:08.470 --> 07:09.970
- See you next week, Todd.
- Okay.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.290
Okay, so...

07:20.350 --> 07:21.400
Jackson.

07:21.420 --> 07:23.350
- Ms. Gallagher.
- Wendy, please.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.380
If you call me Ms. Gallagher
I might throw up.

07:27.110 --> 07:29.080
I'm so sorry. But I can't stay.

07:29.190 --> 07:30.720
I know I said... But then the day just

07:30.740 --> 07:32.036
- got crazy.
- Okay. It's no problem.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.426
Why don't you sit for a second
while I...

07:33.450 --> 07:35.210
Sure. Yeah.

07:37.650 --> 07:40.420
So I, um... I-I've been thinking a lot

07:40.470 --> 07:42.700
about the management
training program at McAlraith.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.460
- That's great.
- Yeah. No, I-I think...

07:44.610 --> 07:45.926
I think it would be really good for me

07:45.950 --> 07:47.390
and all that, you know?

07:47.480 --> 07:49.400
And help me get out of Marietta, too...

07:49.510 --> 07:51.140
It could take you all over the world.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.106
And you'll be with people
who care about culture

07:53.130 --> 07:54.480
as much as you do,

07:54.580 --> 07:56.700
not to mention make
a little bit more money

07:56.720 --> 07:58.050
than you would in pavement sealing.

07:58.070 --> 07:59.720
Well, I, uh,

07:59.740 --> 08:01.030
wouldn't be so sure about that.

08:01.050 --> 08:02.450
But where do I sign?

08:03.770 --> 08:05.326
I'm close with the guy
who runs the program

08:05.350 --> 08:06.790
and I know what he's looking for.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.310
I-I brought a résumé, actually.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.340
Great.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.460
Mm-hmm.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.080
Well, this is great.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.320
Okay.

08:18.550 --> 08:20.440
So, what I need from you now is...

08:20.480 --> 08:22.120
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

08:22.270 --> 08:23.740
For you to write up a report

08:23.770 --> 08:26.050
about the work you've been doing
in Nunn's office.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.190
I can do that.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.910
Can you turn it over
in twenty-four hours?

08:29.010 --> 08:30.350
Sure.

08:30.370 --> 08:32.340
Focus on what's important
to the Senator,

08:32.450 --> 08:34.549
I don't know, arms control, the Summit.

08:34.610 --> 08:37.080
You decide. The more detail the better.

08:37.289 --> 08:40.190
They want to see how observant
and well organized you are.

08:40.390 --> 08:41.620
And don't worry,

08:41.659 --> 08:44.360
the people who'll see it at
McAlraith all have clearances,

08:44.380 --> 08:45.950
so don't worry about that.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.030
Okay.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.079
So we got FISA overnight warrants

08:52.080 --> 08:53.360
for eleven of the garages,

08:53.380 --> 08:55.536
but we want to sit on 'em
for at least forty-eight hours

08:55.560 --> 08:57.140
before entering, make sure we're okay.

08:57.190 --> 08:59.160
Good. Priests? Ganzel?

08:59.380 --> 09:03.140
Well, we've got ten Russian
Orthodox priests active in D.C.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.310
One of them, a Father Victor,

09:05.340 --> 09:07.640
is very close to the Metropolitan.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.480
This guy was promoted to archpriest

09:09.520 --> 09:11.120
over more experienced priests.

09:11.230 --> 09:13.630
Maybe he's really good
at waving incense.

09:13.730 --> 09:16.470
CIA says you can't
move up the chain that fast

09:16.490 --> 09:18.730
without approval from
the powers that be back home.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.500
- Bring him in.
- Okay.

09:20.730 --> 09:23.360
Stan, anything with the cars?

09:23.470 --> 09:25.320
Uh, still going through the papers.
Nothing yet.

09:25.340 --> 09:26.380
What about Burov?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.486
The fact that he's here while
all this shit's going down.

09:28.510 --> 09:30.870
We haven't forgotten about him.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.486
<i>I arrived on this visit to the Soviet...</i>

09:37.510 --> 09:40.650
<i>To the United States of America
in order to complete the work</i>

09:40.750 --> 09:45.320
<i>over the treaty,
to sign the treaty on INF,</i>

09:45.420 --> 09:47.660
<i>and, uh... for lesser range.</i>

09:47.760 --> 09:50.730
<i>That is that agreement
which has been anticipated</i>

09:50.780 --> 09:52.450
<i>by all nations and the whole world.</i>

09:52.560 --> 09:53.880
<i>I have arrived in your country...</i>

09:53.940 --> 09:55.860
It's so weird that he's here.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.400
<i>To complete work...</i>

09:57.430 --> 09:59.370
- Do you...
- <i>and to sign...</i>

09:59.540 --> 10:01.440
You didn't ever meet him, did you?

10:01.540 --> 10:02.820
<i>And shorter-range missiles...</i>

10:02.890 --> 10:05.590
- No.
- <i>thus completing work on...</i>

10:05.760 --> 10:08.260
Are you finished? Now that he's here?
Signing the treaty?

10:08.340 --> 10:09.710
Ah. That was the INF.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.750
They're already working on
another treaty, START,

10:12.850 --> 10:14.450
for larger offensive weapons.

10:14.550 --> 10:16.166
They'll be meeting
for the next three days.

10:16.190 --> 10:18.220
We need to find out what's being said

10:18.320 --> 10:19.920
and see any documents...

10:20.320 --> 10:22.520
The work never ends.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.260
Actually, could you give
Claudia and me a moment alone?

10:25.760 --> 10:27.800
- Meet you in the car?
- Sure.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.970
<i>At the center of our discussions</i>

10:33.070 --> 10:35.070
<i>with the President
of the United States...</i>

10:35.170 --> 10:36.900
I'm so sorry about Marilyn.

10:37.010 --> 10:39.026
<i>Pivotal questions of
Soviet-American relations...</i>

10:39.050 --> 10:40.490
Yeah.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.520
<i>Questions of reducing
strategic offensive arms.</i>

10:43.930 --> 10:46.700
I saw something in Haskard's calendar.

10:46.850 --> 10:49.820
Nesterenko's meeting with
a group of important Americans

10:49.870 --> 10:52.610
at Main State on Wednesday.
Day two of the Summit.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.890
It looks like he'll be
the only Soviet there.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.630
Haskard's going to the meeting.

10:57.730 --> 10:58.966
I'm going to put a listening device

10:58.990 --> 11:00.320
in his briefcase.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.650
I did it.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.330
I did it.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.070
Something went wrong.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.810
You said this was gonna happen.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.290
It's my fault, but...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.030
I just... I couldn't wait...

12:12.140 --> 12:14.300
What did you give her? The morphine.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.000
Everything I saved.

12:16.070 --> 12:19.210
She was begging me... begging...

12:19.340 --> 12:23.340
The pain, she... she just
couldn't take it anymore.

12:23.450 --> 12:24.810
How long has she been like this?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.380
Since yesterday.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.200
Nobody's seen her.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.640
I was going to call
the hospital, but then...

12:33.690 --> 12:35.490
I was waiting for you.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.350
That was good.

12:41.430 --> 12:42.700
Why isn't she dying?

12:42.820 --> 12:45.380
Her system's built up a tolerance.

12:47.380 --> 12:49.410
I waited too long.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.120
I knew I waited too long.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.010
So selfish.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.880
I had to go to my goddamn meetings.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.620
She said so.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.850
She was hurting so much,
she actually said that to me.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.440
And she was right.

13:09.470 --> 13:13.500
I called my office, said I'm done.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.540
I can't come in anymore.

13:16.570 --> 13:19.670
And I... I gave it to her.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.710
Now this.

13:30.050 --> 13:32.780
Glenn. It's going to be all right.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.400
Say goodbye to her now.

13:44.010 --> 13:46.210
Say goodbye, then leave.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.130
She's gone.

17:46.140 --> 17:49.740
You should head upstairs.
And spend some time with her.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.310
It's your last chance.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.700
Did we show the old ones

19:16.730 --> 19:19.030
to the guy who was driving
Harvest's car?

19:19.160 --> 19:21.560
Yeah. After he did his. He said maybe.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.260
He said maybe,

19:23.370 --> 19:24.930
after describing them this way?

19:25.030 --> 19:26.690
It's impossible.

19:26.810 --> 19:28.510
Those disguises.

19:35.910 --> 19:41.020
Well, they're either
all the same people,

19:41.290 --> 19:43.180
or all different people.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.030
Stephanie?

19:56.330 --> 19:58.070
Can you come up here?

19:58.170 --> 19:59.970
Coming.

20:18.890 --> 20:21.490
She really...

20:31.470 --> 20:32.930
Pick one.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.540
What? No. I can't.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.650
No. It... It's important to me.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.220
I want you to take one.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.290
Take it.

24:24.460 --> 24:25.760
There he is...

24:25.780 --> 24:26.950
Hey.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.180
Come on in.

24:28.250 --> 24:29.780
- How you doing?
- Good.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.140
Ta da!

24:35.240 --> 24:36.610
Ooh, what's this?

24:36.660 --> 24:38.640
Your new briefcase.
Which you're going to need

24:38.670 --> 24:40.870
in the McAlraith
management training program.

24:40.890 --> 24:43.200
Oh, my God.

24:43.230 --> 24:44.900
Whoa, it's got my initials on it.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.060
Well, your bag is cool,

24:47.090 --> 24:49.100
but I couldn't send you
into the big, bad world

24:49.130 --> 24:50.890
without making you look like
a real grown-up.

24:52.350 --> 24:53.630
This is great. Thank you.

24:53.730 --> 24:55.430
You're welcome.

24:55.530 --> 24:57.126
Come on in.
It's a little chaotic in here,

24:57.150 --> 24:59.910
I'm always half
living out of a suitcase.

24:59.980 --> 25:01.350
Ooh. Yikes.

25:02.970 --> 25:04.140
Hey. Let's celebrate.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.240
Do you drink?
I don't want to corrupt you.

25:06.340 --> 25:08.140
Um...

25:08.280 --> 25:09.640
Yeah, I drink. I'm twenty-one.

25:09.690 --> 25:11.200
Good.

25:11.550 --> 25:15.650
Oh, yeah, I brought a copy

25:15.750 --> 25:18.540
of, uh,<i>The Big Heat</i> if you have a VCR.

25:18.610 --> 25:19.620
Oh, great.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.750
Yeah.

25:20.860 --> 25:22.526
Uh, my colleague loved
your report, by the way.

25:22.550 --> 25:23.850
Yeah?

25:23.920 --> 25:25.120
Said you're a great writer.

25:25.230 --> 25:27.090
All the detail was perfect.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.080
So expect a call from him next week.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.750
Although don't tell anyone until
you get the official offer.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.140
Of course.

25:33.250 --> 25:34.790
- To Jackson!
- Yeah. And to you.

25:38.090 --> 25:39.590
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

25:39.690 --> 25:42.060
You know, this is such an exciting time.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.490
I'm a small town girl myself.

25:44.630 --> 25:49.100
And, uh, McAlraith just really
changed my whole life.

25:49.190 --> 25:51.220
- Yeah?
- Oh. Totally.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.410
Just made me feel like a grown-up:

25:54.570 --> 25:58.470
Traveling all over the world,
and meeting new people,

25:58.560 --> 26:01.660
I just wasn't my parents'
little kid anymore...

26:01.730 --> 26:03.100
Thank God I went to <i>Rififi.</i>

26:04.550 --> 26:06.240
Hey, you made me look good too.

26:06.270 --> 26:07.730
Believe me, at my age...

26:07.750 --> 26:09.820
I don't think you need
to worry about that.

26:09.930 --> 26:11.200
What?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.390
Oh. Heyyy...

26:13.410 --> 26:15.326
- Oh, I didn't... I didn't mean...
- Oh, you didn't?

26:15.350 --> 26:16.790
Oh that's sad.

26:16.890 --> 26:18.060
No, I mean, I...

26:18.290 --> 26:20.320
You know, I did, I just...

26:21.230 --> 26:22.400
What?

26:27.140 --> 26:29.370
You what, Jackson?

27:35.540 --> 27:37.260
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

27:38.350 --> 27:40.810
I got hung up at work,
wanna go out for Thai food?

27:40.890 --> 27:42.760
Ah, that sounds good.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.400
What is it?

27:49.890 --> 27:51.490
Did Dennis do this?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.360
Do what?

27:54.590 --> 27:57.490
I got a job interview
at the FBI next week.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.830
In Personnel.

27:58.900 --> 28:00.760
Wow. That's great.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.400
Lemme see.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.610
Dennis said he spoke to Wolfe, but...

28:04.940 --> 28:07.450
I didn't think
it would happen this fast.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.810
I told you they don't get
too many applicants

28:09.830 --> 28:11.630
with your experience in management.

28:11.810 --> 28:13.210
What'll they ask me?

28:13.290 --> 28:15.190
Oh, same things
they'd ask you anywhere else...

28:15.410 --> 28:17.610
Except they'll want to know
if you're a loyal American.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.160
And if you can keep a secret.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.130
I don't have to memorize
state capitals or something?

28:22.140 --> 28:23.070
Oh, you're going to do great.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.780
Just be yourself, tell the truth

28:24.810 --> 28:26.980
and they will love you, like I do.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.360
Well, okay, maybe not like that.

28:29.430 --> 28:30.990
But you will knock them dead!

28:31.130 --> 28:32.500
Yeah.

28:32.550 --> 28:34.510
<i>The INF agreement signed yesterday</i>

28:34.530 --> 28:36.730
<i>was only the backdrop
for the superpower meeting.</i>

28:36.830 --> 28:39.030
I'm sorry I have to rush out,
my day's packed.

28:39.060 --> 28:40.960
Me too. Everyone's running around

28:41.010 --> 28:42.946
like a bunch of chickens
with their heads cut off.

28:42.970 --> 28:44.670
Yeah, the Summit.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.550
- A lot of my clients, too.
- Mm.

28:47.650 --> 28:50.840
Actually, I wonder
if you could do me a favor.

28:51.050 --> 28:52.550
Oh. Uh, what?

28:52.990 --> 28:54.450
Well, no, you probably can't just

28:54.510 --> 28:56.046
waltz in and out
of the State Department.

28:56.070 --> 28:57.540
Uh, no.

28:57.590 --> 28:59.670
I mean, sure I can.
I can... I can get in anywhere.

28:59.770 --> 29:01.130
Wh-What do you need?

29:01.320 --> 29:02.940
Well, one of my clients
is working closely

29:02.960 --> 29:04.260
with the Department of Defense.

29:04.330 --> 29:06.940
They have this major meeting
at Main State today.

29:07.060 --> 29:09.460
I'm supposed to get them
these documents before,

29:09.510 --> 29:10.820
but his flight got delayed

29:10.840 --> 29:12.650
and I'm supposed to be at these
meetings all over this morning.

29:12.670 --> 29:14.170
- I can do it.
- Really?

29:14.260 --> 29:15.760
- Yeah.
- Oh.

29:16.070 --> 29:17.640
That would be such a life-saver.

29:17.700 --> 29:21.100
Um, I just have all these
little things all over the city.

29:21.250 --> 29:24.970
You'd just have to leave this
for him in room 6226.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.880
- Okay.
- Just put it in a corner.

29:26.940 --> 29:30.180
Or actually maybe put a piece of
Senator Nunn's stationery on top

29:30.330 --> 29:32.790
with "Fred Sperber, DoD"
so no one takes it.

29:32.820 --> 29:35.160
Fred Sperber. Okay. Yeah, sure.

29:35.260 --> 29:36.830
My knight in shining armor.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.060
Oh, I wish I could stay.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.160
Later.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.860
Bye.

29:47.030 --> 29:48.400
Bye.

29:48.510 --> 29:51.310
<i>And then the President says
that's all well and good,</i>

29:51.410 --> 29:53.440
<i>but that's not what...</i>

30:13.900 --> 30:16.600
Yes. This is Johnny
from Dupont Circle Travel.

30:32.350 --> 30:33.390
<i>Hello?</i>

30:33.420 --> 30:35.950
Hi. Is Henry Jennings there?
It's his father calling.

30:36.050 --> 30:37.820
<i>I think he's at hockey practice.</i>

30:39.060 --> 30:40.960
Uh, can you check?

30:41.060 --> 30:42.850
<i>Sure.</i>

30:43.130 --> 30:45.060
<i>Hey, is Henry around?</i>

30:45.360 --> 30:47.760
<i>His dad's on the phone!</i>

30:49.600 --> 30:51.370
<i>No. Sorry. He's not here.</i>

30:51.470 --> 30:54.170
Okay, uh, just, uh...
Just tell him I called.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.700
Nothing important. Just saying hi.

30:55.730 --> 30:58.030
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Thanks.

31:13.810 --> 31:15.840
Thanks.

31:18.690 --> 31:19.760
What can I get for you?

31:19.800 --> 31:22.740
Curtis, remember me?

31:23.770 --> 31:25.030
Yeah.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.940
You're not in trouble,
it's nothing like that.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.700
I just want to ask you a few questions.

31:28.810 --> 31:30.670
Won't take long.

31:30.770 --> 31:33.010
Hey, Melvin, gimme a second over here.

31:33.110 --> 31:34.240
Mm-hmm.

31:48.350 --> 31:51.000
When you were working
with Gregory Thomas,

31:51.140 --> 31:54.070
you remember the woman
he was hanging out with?

31:55.560 --> 31:57.290
It was a long time ago.

31:57.470 --> 31:59.270
There was a lot of women.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.300
At the time, you said
there was one in particular,

32:02.640 --> 32:03.800
a white woman...

32:03.870 --> 32:06.700
You saw them hanging out
together a bunch of times.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.820
Is that her?

32:16.910 --> 32:18.550
I never really...

32:21.160 --> 32:24.190
Gregory kept her
coming and going pretty private.

32:26.420 --> 32:29.860
It could be her. It could not.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.280
Do you remember anything about her,

32:33.500 --> 32:35.160
anything at all?

32:36.780 --> 32:38.710
She was beautiful.

32:39.930 --> 32:43.770
Had incredible hair.
Like those Vidal Sassoon ads.

32:44.010 --> 32:45.410
Anything else?

32:49.390 --> 32:50.820
She smoked like a chimney.

32:55.030 --> 32:58.590
I gotta get back to work,
if we're done here.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.360
Yeah.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.360
Yeah, thanks.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.300
Hold on a second.

33:08.410 --> 33:10.670
I got something for ya.

33:20.050 --> 33:22.260
You kept your word.

33:23.220 --> 33:26.790
I did a little time after,
but never for that.

33:38.220 --> 33:39.650
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Jackson?

33:39.670 --> 33:41.170
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Hey! It's Wendy.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.390
- <i>Oh, hey.</i>
- So, listen.

33:42.410 --> 33:44.230
After all that,
the meeting was cancelled.

33:44.330 --> 33:45.500
<i>Oh.</i>

33:45.520 --> 33:48.170
I'm hate to ask you this,
but is there any way

33:48.190 --> 33:50.590
you could swing by the room
and pick up that stuff for me?

33:50.720 --> 33:51.770
<i>Um, yeah, sure.</i>

33:51.810 --> 33:54.030
Oh, you're the best. Thanks.

33:55.190 --> 33:56.750
- Just meet me at my car.
- <i>Okay.</i>

34:16.550 --> 34:18.250
Can I come in?

34:19.780 --> 34:21.480
No.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.090
I just want you to know how sorry I am.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.800
Yeah. You said this at the office.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.170
You were there
from the beginning, Stavos.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.489
It's not like
you don't mean anything to us.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.500
You do.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.230
And you probably look
at me and you think

34:51.260 --> 34:52.270
I'm doing great

34:52.290 --> 34:55.130
with all these fancy clothes
and a nice car and...

34:56.090 --> 34:59.340
the agency's remodeled...
but the truth is

35:01.540 --> 35:02.940
we're in trouble.

35:04.710 --> 35:07.850
And I don't know if the business
is going to survive.

35:09.050 --> 35:12.320
And we're doing pretty bad personally.

35:12.580 --> 35:14.450
Financially.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.790
In a way, it is better

35:16.840 --> 35:19.470
you got out earlier than later.

35:20.020 --> 35:22.660
You can start to look for a job.

35:25.930 --> 35:29.670
I-I started working for you
when the business was small.

35:31.150 --> 35:33.360
I watched your kids grow up.

35:34.860 --> 35:38.700
Whatever was going on in the back room,

35:38.920 --> 35:40.560
I never called the police.

35:42.190 --> 35:45.090
I never said anything to anyone.

35:45.250 --> 35:46.920
And I never will.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.640
I was raised to be loyal.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.360
My knight in shining armor.

36:55.510 --> 36:56.750
What?

36:58.080 --> 37:00.360
Come on. Let's go. Get in the car.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.120
What, Jackson? I'm not a mind-reader.

37:28.770 --> 37:30.250
When I picked up your documents...

37:30.300 --> 37:32.830
there was this meeting going on in 6226

37:32.860 --> 37:34.420
about water resources in Ghana.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.160
It was really packed.

37:36.190 --> 37:38.316
And so then I went in, and I got
the stuff out of the corner.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.640
And then on the way out, I noticed,

37:40.670 --> 37:42.166
on the clipboard by the door...
That they'd...

37:42.190 --> 37:43.600
They'd been in there
since eleven o'clock,

37:43.620 --> 37:45.296
and that there was just
one meeting before them.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.660
Some, like, Summit thing.

37:46.790 --> 37:47.960
So?

37:49.450 --> 37:51.320
There was no cancelled meetings.

37:51.490 --> 37:54.990
Well, I don't know the way the
rooms work at State, Jackson.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.220
Well, I looked in the files.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.790
Okay, listen. This is not a big deal.

38:15.950 --> 38:17.950
You had me bug a meeting
at the State Department!

38:18.060 --> 38:19.220
Bug a meeting?

38:19.320 --> 38:21.560
Okay, first of all,

38:21.890 --> 38:23.510
the meeting never happened, right?

38:23.600 --> 38:27.090
And secondly... my client
was supposed to be there.

38:27.150 --> 38:28.930
This is like... a way of taking notes.

38:29.030 --> 38:30.480
What are you talking about?!?
This is illegal!

38:30.500 --> 38:34.019
Jackson, my client wanted the details

38:34.020 --> 38:36.740
of a meeting to help prepare
a bid for a contract.

38:36.790 --> 38:38.386
I know you're young
and it might seem strange

38:38.410 --> 38:39.756
because you've never done it before,

38:39.780 --> 38:41.380
but this is the real world.

38:41.550 --> 38:43.980
I mean, this is what you do
to get a competitive edge.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.580
So then that's what
the police would call this?

38:45.600 --> 38:46.740
A competitive edge?

38:46.800 --> 38:50.150
Okay, just hang on a second.

38:57.660 --> 38:59.210
What is going on here?

38:59.370 --> 39:02.010
Who are you? I mean, I don't...
I don't get it,

39:02.040 --> 39:03.130
- I thought that maybe you...
- Okay. Okay.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.950
Hey, listen to me.

39:05.470 --> 39:07.970
Jackson, you're a...
You're a sensitive guy.

39:08.070 --> 39:09.880
- And I understand...
- I'm not sensitive.

39:09.910 --> 39:12.640
And I'm not an idiot, either,
okay? People don't do this.

39:12.940 --> 39:15.110
I know. My father is in
business. He would not do this.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.770
I will... I'll call him
right now and ask him, okay?

39:17.830 --> 39:18.850
Jackson!

39:21.690 --> 39:23.150
Close the door.

39:31.910 --> 39:33.300
I wanna go.

39:49.870 --> 39:51.200
Listen to me.

39:53.570 --> 39:56.440
Don't mention this to your father.

39:56.660 --> 40:00.180
You're old enough now
to keep some things to yourself.

40:00.850 --> 40:03.620
Don't mention this to anybody.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.230
Do you understand?

40:05.740 --> 40:07.730
Can I go?

40:07.970 --> 40:10.000
Tell me that you understand.

40:12.740 --> 40:15.170
I don't understand.

40:31.090 --> 40:33.050
Go back to school.

40:34.490 --> 40:36.780
Enjoy your last semester.

40:38.490 --> 40:40.970
And go into the pavement business.

40:41.550 --> 40:44.100
I don't think McAlraith
is the right fit for you.

40:48.490 --> 40:49.580
Go.

41:26.330 --> 41:28.530
That hangs perfectly.

41:30.540 --> 41:32.270
I love this cut on you.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.840
You don't like it?

41:38.010 --> 41:39.900
It's fine.

41:40.020 --> 41:42.260
We just need to take up
the sleeve, hem the trousers,

41:42.290 --> 41:44.260
that's it.

41:44.430 --> 41:45.690
It's beautiful.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.660
<i>Unusual to call this meeting,</i>

41:53.810 --> 41:56.920
<i>but General Secretary Gorbachev
asked me to convey a message,</i>

41:57.060 --> 41:59.930
<i>outside regular channels.</i>

42:00.010 --> 42:04.310
<i>Now that INF has been signed
and we are moving on to START,</i>

42:04.480 --> 42:07.210
<i>he wants you to understand
he's completely sincere</i>

42:07.320 --> 42:11.380
<i>about what he told
President Reagan in Reykjavik.</i>

42:11.490 --> 42:13.220
<i>His goal is not only reducing</i>

42:13.320 --> 42:15.890
<i>number of long-range nuclear missiles</i>

42:15.990 --> 42:18.820
<i>that our two countries
have pointed at each other.</i>

42:18.930 --> 42:23.830
<i>What he wants is total
elimination of nuclear weapons.</i>

42:23.930 --> 42:25.530
<i>In order to accomplish this,</i>

42:25.630 --> 42:28.030
<i>he is now ready to go even further.</i>

42:28.140 --> 42:31.670
<i>At Reykjavik, he expressed
a strong opposition to SDI.</i>

42:31.770 --> 42:34.240
<i>He's not yet willing to change
that position publicly,</i>

42:34.340 --> 42:38.410
<i>but I am authorized to tell
the people in this room,</i>

42:38.510 --> 42:42.750
<i>if you agree to complete
nuclear disarmament,</i>

42:42.850 --> 42:46.350
<i>he will drop all opposition to SDI.</i>

42:46.450 --> 42:48.850
<i>He will agree
to all American requirements</i>

42:48.960 --> 42:51.260
<i>for a verification regime.</i>

42:51.360 --> 42:57.200
<i>Full elimination...
This is his greatest dream.</i>

42:57.300 --> 43:00.600
<i>For his legacy, for President Reagan,</i>

43:00.700 --> 43:02.300
<i>for the world.</i>

43:13.590 --> 43:15.490
You smoke too much.

43:15.580 --> 43:17.520
So I've been told.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.980
From Haskard's briefcase?

43:23.240 --> 43:24.700
No.

43:25.050 --> 43:26.610
Erica died,

43:26.800 --> 43:29.060
Haskard stopped working
before the meeting.

43:29.140 --> 43:32.040
I got in with my contact
at Sam Nunn's office.

43:32.330 --> 43:36.370
Nesterenko didn't say anything
suspicious at the meeting.

43:36.660 --> 43:39.140
It doesn't matter. We got new orders.

43:39.420 --> 43:41.690
You need to take care of him.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.990
Today or tomorrow.

44:05.380 --> 44:07.080
Catherine Gates: <i>I'll
cooperate by getting the map</i>

44:07.100 --> 44:09.170
<i>and finding out where we are.</i>

44:09.270 --> 44:10.860
<i>Who put us on the river
in the first place?</i>

44:10.880 --> 44:12.510
<i>I knew you were going to say that.</i>

44:12.540 --> 44:14.700
- <i>You're tiresome.
- You're subnormal.</i>

44:14.720 --> 44:16.860
<i>I don't propose
to argue with you any further.</i>

44:17.100 --> 44:18.910
<i>Oh, dear. That darn road</i>

44:18.940 --> 44:20.640
<i>doesn't come within
10 kilometers of here.</i>

44:20.920 --> 44:23.180
<i>What? Across open country in that thing?</i>

44:23.280 --> 44:24.720
<i>Oh, it'll just be a little bumpy.</i>

44:24.750 --> 44:26.810
<i>Only for a couple of hours.
We'll make it by 3:00.</i>

44:27.010 --> 44:28.870
<i>Ha. We won't get there before dark,</i>

44:28.920 --> 44:31.820
- <i>if we get there at all.
- This motorcycle'll go anywhere.</i>

44:32.060 --> 44:34.460
<i>If you'll get your pants off
that grass and help me get it...</i>

46:55.630 --> 46:57.650
I didn't do it.

46:58.450 --> 47:00.050
Nesterenko.

47:01.810 --> 47:03.240
What happened?

47:05.050 --> 47:07.080
Did you listen to the recording?

47:08.120 --> 47:10.120
He seems like a decent man.

47:10.220 --> 47:12.150
Not a traitor.

47:12.350 --> 47:15.120
We haven't seen or heard him
do anything to prove...

47:15.180 --> 47:16.880
It needs to be done.

47:17.510 --> 47:19.310
What do you mean?

47:20.430 --> 47:24.460
It needs to be done,
whether you're convinced or not.

47:25.920 --> 47:28.420
I don't understand.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.100
I've been protecting you.

47:38.330 --> 47:40.630
We protect you from knowing everything,

47:40.650 --> 47:42.580
so you can do your job.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.130
But if you've lost your confidence...

47:45.160 --> 47:47.560
I haven't lost my confidence.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.160
Then what?

47:54.400 --> 47:56.100
I just...

47:58.100 --> 47:59.710
this time...

48:00.010 --> 48:02.040
I need to know.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.790
Back home,

48:11.780 --> 48:16.350
we have a leader
who has no sense of our history,

48:16.860 --> 48:18.720
no sense of our ideals.

48:18.820 --> 48:21.650
No sense of how we've sacrificed
to build a great nation,

48:21.680 --> 48:23.680
and the price we've paid.

48:23.830 --> 48:25.560
He's giving it all away.

48:25.830 --> 48:29.980
Some right here,
this week, to the Americans.

48:30.360 --> 48:34.340
Some back home,
month by month, week by week.

48:35.030 --> 48:37.260
It's almost too late to stop him.

48:40.650 --> 48:43.210
What does this have to do
with Nesterenko?

48:43.310 --> 48:45.410
After you've taken care of him,

48:45.640 --> 48:48.010
we'll make a slight alteration

48:48.090 --> 48:50.220
to the reports
you've been making on him,

48:50.620 --> 48:53.450
so it appears he was trading away

48:53.480 --> 48:57.180
a highly classified
defense program for Gorbachev.

48:59.150 --> 49:01.250
They told me you didn't know about that.

49:01.450 --> 49:03.490
We were protecting you.

49:04.300 --> 49:06.120
I'm sure you understand there's a chance

49:06.180 --> 49:08.470
that this could go badly.

49:08.570 --> 49:11.650
As long as you didn't know
all of these details,

49:11.840 --> 49:14.770
nothing would happen to you,
if it didn't work out.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.530
You were just doing your job.

49:19.220 --> 49:21.090
And if it does work out?

49:22.250 --> 49:23.990
We quietly take these reports

49:24.020 --> 49:27.910
to certain members
of the Central Committee,

49:28.060 --> 49:31.760
key military leaders,
and regional party secretaries

49:31.830 --> 49:34.960
who understand the situation we're in...

49:35.480 --> 49:38.380
Enough of them will be outraged.

49:38.520 --> 49:41.050
Gorbachev will be removed.

49:43.570 --> 49:46.440
He probably won't even come back home.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.750
So, Mexico...

49:51.460 --> 49:52.970
everything...

49:54.920 --> 49:56.810
it was all this.

49:57.590 --> 49:59.320
To get rid of Gorbachev.

49:59.530 --> 50:01.150
We also had to get Dead Hand to work.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.000
I'm sure you understand that.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.490
Who ordered this?

50:08.600 --> 50:10.460
The Centre.

50:10.780 --> 50:14.270
The very top leaders there
are all behind this.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.420
They're also working with

50:16.550 --> 50:18.950
certain high-level military leaders,

50:19.090 --> 50:20.920
like your friend from Mexico.

50:22.410 --> 50:24.610
But not the Party.

50:25.790 --> 50:28.080
We're all in the Party.

50:31.230 --> 50:33.030
I won't do it.

50:36.710 --> 50:38.940
I can't make you do anything.

50:41.550 --> 50:43.690
But Elizabeth...

50:44.630 --> 50:46.370
Keep quiet.

50:48.010 --> 50:51.030
After all these years,
serving your country,

50:52.890 --> 50:56.090
don't throw it all away, now.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.200
What are you looking at?

51:54.650 --> 51:56.120
The moon.

52:00.020 --> 52:01.530
Pretty tonight.

52:02.170 --> 52:03.710
Yeah.

52:13.650 --> 52:14.990
You coming?

52:16.250 --> 52:17.610
In a minute.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.690
I need to talk to your guy.

52:57.620 --> 52:59.030
What?

52:59.570 --> 53:00.840
Why?

53:00.900 --> 53:02.970
Just tell me
how to get in touch with him.

53:08.930 --> 53:09.990
Dead drop.

53:10.100 --> 53:11.930
I thought you met with him.

53:11.990 --> 53:14.050
He's being watched now.

53:14.390 --> 53:15.940
I need the contact plan.

53:16.100 --> 53:18.140
What do you want to say to him?

53:26.930 --> 53:28.910
- Look...
- No.

53:35.350 --> 53:36.860
I was just trying to figure out
the best way

53:36.880 --> 53:38.710
to deal with all this crap.

53:40.420 --> 53:42.450
And you settled on betraying me?

53:42.610 --> 53:44.030
I was putting our country first.

53:44.060 --> 53:45.530
Which is what you would have done.

53:49.170 --> 53:50.640
I'm sorry.

53:55.410 --> 53:57.400
Can you get him a message for me?

53:58.380 --> 53:59.750
Yes.

54:05.830 --> 54:11.240
Tell him that what
he's worried about is happening.

54:11.780 --> 54:12.880
The leaders at the Centre

54:12.910 --> 54:15.470
are trying to get rid of Gorbachev.

54:15.610 --> 54:17.410
Claudia just told me.

54:17.820 --> 54:19.800
They want me to kill that negotiator

54:19.820 --> 54:22.720
that I was worried about...
Fyodor Nesterenko.

54:22.750 --> 54:24.480
But he's not bad.

54:24.680 --> 54:26.880
I've been watching him.

54:26.990 --> 54:28.390
They want to falsify my reports,

54:28.420 --> 54:30.480
make it seem like he's trading away

54:30.510 --> 54:33.290
a highly classified
military system to the U.S.

54:33.350 --> 54:35.040
But he's not.

54:35.750 --> 54:37.510
Our people are working
with the military,

54:37.530 --> 54:40.270
like that general I met with
in Mexico, Kovtun.

54:41.990 --> 54:43.760
They want to get this done
so that Gorbachev

54:43.800 --> 54:46.160
doesn't even come back from the Summit.

54:47.330 --> 54:49.640
Can you relay that message for me?

54:50.990 --> 54:53.010
He checks the signal site late morning.

54:53.030 --> 54:55.530
He'll have it by two, three o'clock.

54:58.620 --> 54:59.990
I have to go back out.

55:00.030 --> 55:01.540
They might still go after this guy.

55:01.610 --> 55:02.680
Do you need my help?

55:04.520 --> 55:05.980
- No.
- Wait.

55:08.150 --> 55:10.050
This came in while you were out.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.380
Father Andrei.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.740
I can't.

55:15.870 --> 55:18.170
You meet him.

55:18.250 --> 55:20.720
Maybe he'll give you absolution.
