<i>That's why I think a ten-foot

that I feel that Oak Island
has done a lot for our area

05:11.060 --> 05:12.969

and that if he'd like to come

05:13.062 --> 05:14.813

and then we would like

05:14.897 --> 05:16.648

asked that we stop down...

06:07.116 --> 06:08.700

finding the artifacts.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.381
Our ability to work,
function on our own island

there's nothing negative

help with moving forward.

he'll have the ability

07:21.107 --> 07:23.442

I think his...
merely his presence here,

07:29.866 --> 07:32.701

exemplifies

07:32.785 --> 07:35.370

Right, last day, guys.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.719
I think positive.

07:59.803 --> 08:01.396
I believe it was
a heck of a lot of treasure

So, this is the last day
we can dig in the swamp,

08:19.990 --> 08:22.992
because we're gonna need
the water in the swamp

08:23.077 --> 08:25.337
to use on the wash table
up at the Money Pit.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.172
- Mm-hmm.
- Basically, it's a trade-off.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.998
We're going
from looking for the ship

08:29.083 --> 08:31.593

08:31.677 --> 08:32.919
We need to put
that thing to work,

08:33.930 --> 08:35.931
Yep. Well, we got one more day.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.945
It's tough to tell.

10:23.039 --> 10:23.955
I mean, it has
been in the swamp.

10:24.114 --> 10:25.373
It's well-preserved.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.709
It looks like
an handle to a tool.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.793
PETER:
Mm-hmm.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.713
I mean,
it is a small, little tool.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.624
Maybe it was a,
like, a ship's wheel.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.542

there's reason to pursue

to understand what the swamp

- GARY: That's massive.

11:35.185 --> 11:37.445

Look at that.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.867
I mean, look at that.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.694
You can see
that that's been axe-cut.

11:44.778 --> 11:47.864
I would a-assume that
if it was more modern,

11:47.948 --> 11:49.833
it would have been sawed.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.618
Can you put that
to one side, please?

11:52.712 --> 11:53.545
I'll grab it.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.042
There's a lot of stuff in this.

12:00.127 --> 12:01.803
A little piece of planking.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.300
It's the same thickness as
all the other pieces of planking

12:07.384 --> 12:08.893
or decking that we've found.

12:09.052 --> 12:10.145
Wow.

12:45.422 --> 12:46.431
Yeah, we got off

- PETER: Yep.

12:47.925 --> 12:48.767
Cheers.

12:49.927 --> 12:52.937
So, this is the three pieces.
I mean...

12:53.096 --> 12:53.938
- A couple of stakes.
- A couple of stakes.

12:54.097 --> 12:56.858

- That's a shaped piece of wood, yeah.

of the swamp

two percent of it, maybe?

13:32.386 --> 13:33.895
-DAVID F.: Yeah.
-PETER: Maybe, yeah. And you think about

13:34.054 --> 13:36.231

from eyesight,

13:36.390 --> 13:39.225
and we're digging through muck,
how much more stuff we missed.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.736

- Yeah.

580 feet.

of the issues--

16:28.654 --> 16:32.907

more or less, immediately,

16:32.992 --> 16:36.911
with a 40-meter-radius
"don't touch" spot around it.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.321
Which, I mean, 40 meters

16:39.415 --> 16:40.832
- is a pretty big radius.
- It's pretty significant.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.492

- as we possibly can, you know?
- As right as you can.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.583

17:42.811 --> 17:44.562
<i>and his wife Carol.</i>

17:44.721 --> 17:46.555
- CAROL: Wow.
- MARTY: Those are something, aren't they?

17:46.648 --> 17:47.899
- (laughter)
- TIM: A little big.

17:48.058 --> 17:50.318
MARTY: We've got enough
to go 180 feet here this year.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.403
And we're pretty excited
about what we might bring up.

17:52.562 --> 17:54.655
- CAROL: Yeah? - TIM: Yeah?
- This is Vanessa.

17:54.815 --> 17:56.991
- She runs all this giant stuff.
- Hi. - TIM: Hi. Tim Houston.

17:57.150 --> 17:59.485
- BOTH: Nice to meet you.
- MARTY: This is Carol Houston.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.496
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you guys.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.832
Quite a buzz around the next,
uh, phase of the operation.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.335
VANESSA: There is, right?
All of our casings are here now.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.254
So we'll be here
to hopefully help them

18:10.413 --> 18:12.090
- uncover some history.
- Yeah, I hope so.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.499
So this should be a piece
of cake for you, then, right?

18:13.583 --> 18:15.084
- This is gonna be easy...
- Except Oak Island...

18:15.177 --> 18:18.429
- It is Oak Island. Yeah.
- always-always throws its hook at you.

18:18.588 --> 18:21.015
<i>MARTY:
Premier Houston, I think,</i>

18:21.100 --> 18:23.592
is suitably impressed with
the scale of our operation here.

18:23.677 --> 18:25.269
<i>And being able to talk</i>

18:25.428 --> 18:27.513
<i>to the-the new premier
is wonderful.</i>

18:27.597 --> 18:29.190
<i>He gets a sense
of what we're doing.</i>

18:29.274 --> 18:31.192
<i>We get a sense
of his philosophy.</i>

18:31.276 --> 18:33.945
<i>But if even once
we can get through to him</i>

18:34.104 --> 18:36.772
and say, "Look, we have a real
issue, could you help us,"

18:36.865 --> 18:40.025
<i>that's what's gonna be
the most valuable today.</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:43.696
It would be so much easier
to reconcile the issues

18:43.780 --> 18:46.866
that we are now under
or contending with,

18:46.959 --> 18:50.452
if we felt that we had done
something wrong.

18:50.537 --> 18:53.372
- Yeah.
- That you missed something, a mistake... whatever, right?

18:53.456 --> 18:55.466
- Yeah.
- In fact, we've exceeded,

18:55.551 --> 18:57.885
by magnitudes, everything.

18:58.044 --> 19:00.713
I mean, we have done everything
that we felt was necessary,

19:00.806 --> 19:02.882
- and thus the oversight is...
- MARTY: Right, and to prove it,

19:02.966 --> 19:05.134
I could say that I haven't
always agreed

19:05.227 --> 19:06.886
- with Laird's decisions.
- (laughter)

19:06.970 --> 19:08.479
LAIRD:
I read a quote once, but--

19:08.638 --> 19:09.555
"If you have everybody angry
at you,

19:09.639 --> 19:10.565
you must be doing
something right."

19:10.724 --> 19:12.057
- (laughter)
- Something right, yeah.

19:12.142 --> 19:13.809
TIM:
I think the thing is,

19:13.902 --> 19:16.061
is that there's
no shortcuts in life.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.323
That's the lesson that this,
that this drives home.

19:19.408 --> 19:23.327
And there's none being
taken here on this project.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.404
And anything that's worth doing
is worth doing right.

19:25.488 --> 19:27.489
- Agreed.
- And, uh, you guys

19:27.574 --> 19:29.500
- are doing it right.
- We're trying very hard.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.743
Yeah. I feel that way.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.254
It's always a balance, right?

19:33.338 --> 19:35.664
It's a, it's a balance,
and-and it's-it's making sure

19:35.749 --> 19:38.426
that you don't have,
on one side of the equation,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.261
"Well, we have to be, you know,
we have to be cautious

19:40.420 --> 19:41.670
and respectful,"
and all that stuff,

19:41.763 --> 19:46.008
but that can't go so far
that common sense is lost.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.843
So the things that
you're-you're talking about,

19:47.928 --> 19:49.094
I can see both sides of it.

19:49.179 --> 19:52.431
But now the job
is to find the common sense

19:52.524 --> 19:54.859
that is that respectful balance,
and-and, you know,

19:55.018 --> 19:56.602
I'm hopeful
that-that that can be found.

19:56.686 --> 19:58.696
And I think there's a,
there-there's a will

19:58.855 --> 20:01.532
to find that balance
and that common sense.

20:01.691 --> 20:03.367
And I think when people
start talking...

20:03.526 --> 20:04.860
- Yes.
- and listening to each other

20:04.945 --> 20:06.370
and learning from each other

20:06.455 --> 20:08.873
- and understand the concerns...
- Yeah.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.950
that's when you'll find
the balance.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.211
And-and that's what
I'd be an advocate for.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.795
<i>MARTY:
I think</i>

20:14.955 --> 20:16.705
Premier Houston's reaction

20:16.798 --> 20:18.374
to what we're saying
is very favorable.

20:18.458 --> 20:22.294
<i>I think he very much understands
what we need to function here,</i>

20:22.379 --> 20:24.472

20:24.631 --> 20:26.215
the right parties together

- This has turned into a really hot little area

Lot 32, I mean, you can't deny
the artifacts that we found

was maybe an ox shoe.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.606

- That would be great.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.275
Especially if we believe
there is a wharf here, mate,

22:50.369 --> 22:54.279

and unloading in this area.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.790

- Pretty big.
- Um...

23:00.036 --> 23:02.046

- Nope.
- Maybe not.

It's not an ox shoe...

23:07.877 --> 23:10.721
- No?
- but it is a square ox shoe nail.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.798
- ALEX: Oh, yeah?
- No mistaking that.

23:12.882 --> 23:14.642
- ALEX: Yep.
- And I believe Michael John

23:14.726 --> 23:18.053

just up the hill there.

23:18.138 --> 23:20.389

- Yep.

using oxes in this area.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.819
- And this ain't farmland.
- No.

23:24.903 --> 23:29.240
So, more than likely,
something to do with hauling,

23:29.399 --> 23:32.067
- especially connected to that wharf.
- Mm-hmm.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.237

23:35.321 --> 23:36.822
<i>It's in great condition,</i>

23:36.915 --> 23:39.158
but it's out of place,

23:39.251 --> 23:43.495
<i>because this wasn't farmland,
which begs the question,</i>

23:43.588 --> 23:46.999
<i>what were people hauling
in this area back in the day?</i>

23:47.083 --> 23:49.251
(beeping)

23:49.335 --> 23:52.096
That sounds very, very good.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.098
- It's just there, mate, yeah.
- Right there? Okay.

23:56.426 --> 23:58.686
And I would not have
been able to detect that

23:58.845 --> 24:01.346
- if the guys hadn't cut that tree.
- Yeah, the tree's right there.

24:01.431 --> 24:02.514
ALEX: Didn't you tell
me a long time ago,

24:02.607 --> 24:04.859
there are good finds
at the base of trees?

24:04.943 --> 24:06.768
Yeah, I always love it
when I get a signal

24:06.862 --> 24:10.030
next to a base
of a big old tree.

24:10.190 --> 24:12.366
Because old coins and artifacts

24:12.451 --> 24:14.610
are often pushed closer
to the surface

24:14.703 --> 24:16.778
- by the roots of the trees.
- Oh.

24:16.863 --> 24:18.956
All right.
Let's hope that happened here.

24:24.621 --> 24:26.288

24:26.372 --> 24:28.207
- You have got it out.
- Yep.

24:28.291 --> 24:31.710
A nice two-way
repeatable signal.

24:31.794 --> 24:34.805
Come on. A coin or a button.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.970
It's out, mate.
And I know what it is.

24:42.055 --> 24:44.056
- Do you?
- I can feel it.

24:44.149 --> 24:44.982
The weight of it.

24:46.059 --> 24:48.319
- What is it?
- A musket ball.

24:48.478 --> 24:50.062
- Oh. that's pretty cool.
- It really is, mate.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.155
- ALEX: Nice.
- Look at that.

24:51.314 --> 24:53.824
- That looks like it's been fired.
- Yeah.

- with the military

25:47.287 --> 25:50.464

being unloaded at that wharf.

- Yeah.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.710
Yeah. I'm hoping
they lost some gold or...

25:54.803 --> 25:56.053
- Yeah. Me, too.
- silver coins as well.

25:56.212 --> 25:57.137
Absolutely.

<i>The 58-ton rotating oscillator.</i>

26:52.861 --> 26:54.770
So, what do you think,
this year?

26:54.854 --> 26:56.855
I'm excited as all get-out.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.617
Every year I'm like,
"Let's go big, let's go big,"

26:59.776 --> 27:02.286
- and y'all are finally going big.
- (laughter)

27:02.445 --> 27:03.945
- ANDREW: Here we are now.
- PETER: Oh, yeah.

27:04.030 --> 27:04.863
Wow.

27:04.947 --> 27:06.874
<i>We're all highly anticipating</i>

27:07.033 --> 27:09.117
<i>getting this project started,</i>

27:09.210 --> 27:12.788
<i>so to see the oscillator
arriving is exciting.</i>

27:12.872 --> 27:15.799
I want to find the answers.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.217
DANNY:
Good right there, straight back.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.302
<i>RICK:

27:20.713 --> 27:22.130
It's good right there, brother.

27:22.215 --> 27:23.390
Perfection.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.143
RICK: So what is the
difference between this one

27:26.302 --> 27:28.062
and the 2.5?

27:28.221 --> 27:30.481
VANESSA:
It's gonna have more power.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.316
It's going to be a heavier
machine, because when

27:32.475 --> 27:34.059
you're starting to get bigger
cans, you want more weight

27:34.152 --> 27:36.978
to ground it, so this machine

27:37.072 --> 27:40.565
is more powerful, heavier,
bigger in diameter.

27:40.650 --> 27:45.996
<i>NARRATOR: Designed to
apply up to 1,185 tons of torque,</i>

28:42.462 --> 28:45.222
You got it. He's clear.

28:45.381 --> 28:47.966
Up. Up a little bit.

28:48.050 --> 28:50.218
RICK:
That's pretty big.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.146
It looks like a-a battleship.

28:52.305 --> 28:54.732
It does.
Yeah, no, I'm with you on that.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.225
<i>DAVID F.: You can feel the

28:57.310 --> 28:59.570
<i>Uh, it's been a while
since we were able to dig,</i>

28:59.729 --> 29:01.572
<i>and this year
we're going bigger than ever.</i>

<i>- I, personally,</i>

29:03.575 --> 29:06.076
<i>have never been part
of a Money Pit dig before.</i>

29:06.235 --> 29:09.747

this process is really exciting.

29:10.990 --> 29:12.332
DANNY:
Here it comes.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.542
Two more feet.

29:16.078 --> 29:18.922
Just touch down. It's good.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.260
Give us about an hour,
and we're gonna be, uh, flying

29:23.419 --> 29:24.503
over that first can,
so if you guys want to...

29:24.587 --> 29:26.671
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.757
Okay. All right, well,
I'm gonna go get the boys going.

29:28.841 --> 29:30.184
- All right. Thanks.
- Okay. Thank you, Vanessa.

29:30.343 --> 29:33.011
So, let's let the team
do their work.

29:33.095 --> 29:35.180
- Sounds good.
- All right.

29:35.264 --> 29:37.516
<i>NARRATOR: While

29:45.608 --> 29:47.618
the most interesting
but most confusing,

29:47.702 --> 29:52.456
the so-called bag seal that Gary
and David found off of Lot 32.

29:52.615 --> 29:55.116
Thus, we reached out
to Dr. Brosseau,

29:55.210 --> 29:58.203
who kindly agreed
to take a look.

29:58.287 --> 30:01.381

about the lead bag seal.

30:30.987 --> 30:33.321
<i>CHRISTA:
Yeah, sure, so,</i>

30:33.414 --> 30:35.323
that's such an interesting piece

30:35.416 --> 30:38.919
because it really speaks
to history.

30:39.078 --> 30:41.746
<i>So, bag seals were used</i>

30:41.840 --> 30:44.916
for large, uh, bundles of cloth.

30:45.001 --> 30:46.918
How big were these sacks?

30:47.011 --> 30:48.595
<i>- Really large.</i>
- Yeah, they were quite large.

30:48.754 --> 30:50.255
<i>My understanding, yeah.</i>

30:50.348 --> 30:53.842
It's-it's a large bale of cloth.

30:53.926 --> 30:55.093
How do you know it's cloth?

30:55.177 --> 30:56.854
How do you know
it's associated with cloth?

30:56.938 --> 30:59.690
Uh, that style's
associated with cloth.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.683
- Okay.
<i>- CHRISTA: Yeah, that's right.</i>

31:01.776 --> 31:03.944
<i>So, bag seals were popular</i>

31:04.028 --> 31:08.282
from about 1450, and then,
after about 1730, waned

31:08.441 --> 31:10.450
<i>in terms of their usage.</i>

31:10.610 --> 31:12.786
<i>So this is really an old piece.</i>

31:12.945 --> 31:14.705
Well, that's pre-searcher.

31:14.864 --> 31:16.206
Perfect.

31:16.365 --> 31:18.283
Yep.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.785
<i>CHRISTA: As you know,
the-the lead bag seal has</i>

31:20.870 --> 31:23.121
<i>- really nice markings on it.</i>
- LAIRD: Yeah.

31:23.205 --> 31:25.048
They're really
interesting-looking markings.

31:25.207 --> 31:31.463
<i>There's a stylized 4,
and it's flanked by initials.</i>

31:31.556 --> 31:34.299
Which would be the person
who produced the fabric.

31:34.383 --> 31:36.468
<i>CHRISTA: Yeah, it would've
been an important indication</i>

31:36.552 --> 31:38.395
that it had been inspected
and was a-approved

31:38.554 --> 31:39.897
to go out for trade.

31:40.056 --> 31:44.401
<i>So, the initials are a little
bit hard to make out.</i>

31:47.063 --> 31:49.740
<i>Uh, the left might be a "T,"</i>

31:49.899 --> 31:52.659
<i>and on the right
it does look like an "E."</i>

31:52.744 --> 31:56.580
Um, maybe Treasury of England,
T.E.?

31:57.907 --> 31:59.750
Wow.

32:03.746 --> 32:04.922
<i>CHRISTA:
The initials are T.E.</i>

32:05.006 --> 32:06.757
Maybe Treasury of England.

<i>NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island war room,</i>

32:12.513 --> 32:16.424
<i>chemist Dr. Christa Brosseau
has just presented her opinion</i>

32:16.509 --> 32:18.435
<i>that the cargo bag seal</i>

32:18.519 --> 32:20.762
<i>discovered one year ago
on Lot 32</i>

32:20.855 --> 32:23.190
<i>is more than 300 years old</i>

32:23.349 --> 32:27.194
<i>and possibly connected
to the Treasury of England.</i>

32:27.278 --> 32:30.364
<i>CHRISTA: Of course, Canada,
Nova Scotia, is a colony,</i>

32:30.523 --> 32:33.024
<i>so there would have been
a lot of transported goods</i>

32:33.109 --> 32:35.369
<i>from England, for example.</i>

32:35.453 --> 32:37.371
And so, we would probably expect

32:37.455 --> 32:40.123
lots of cloths, uh,
being in trade.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.201
But to an island?
A small island...

32:43.285 --> 32:45.120
- Yeah, that's what's weird, right?
- in Mahone Bay?

32:45.213 --> 32:46.463
RICK: I mean, that
just doesn't seem...

32:46.547 --> 32:49.549
That's the most exciting thing
about it, I think.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.042
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not something people carry around.

32:51.127 --> 32:53.387
- (laughter)
- When you open the bale,

32:53.471 --> 32:55.138
off goes the-the seal.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.800
- Okay.
<i>- NARRATOR: Could Dr. Brosseau</i>

32:58.884 --> 33:01.228

<i>and related to goods belonging
to the Treasury of England?</i>

33:07.893 --> 33:11.563
<i>If so, how did it end up
on an island</i>

33:11.647 --> 33:13.815
<i>that, beginning
in the 18th century,</i>

33:13.899 --> 33:16.901
<i>was known only to be inhabited
by local farmers?</i>

33:16.986 --> 33:19.988
<i>Could it be connected
to a secret operation</i>

33:20.072 --> 33:23.667
<i>to bury a vast cache
of silver in the Money Pit?</i>

33:23.751 --> 33:26.003
I've found, I believe,
significant information

33:26.087 --> 33:28.422
that really strengthens,
uh, the idea

33:28.506 --> 33:30.507
of there being silver
in this area.

33:30.591 --> 33:31.499
Interesting.

33:31.584 --> 33:33.343
<i>NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago,</i>

33:33.428 --> 33:36.513
<i>Scott Clarke,
a 32nd-degree Freemason,</i>

33:36.597 --> 33:39.766
<i>presented his theory
that the 17th century</i>

33:39.851 --> 33:42.427
<i>English merchant and nobleman
Sir William Phips</i>

33:42.520 --> 33:45.439
<i>was behind the construction
of the Money Pit.</i>

33:45.523 --> 33:47.682
SCOTT C.: Many
people are actually familiar

33:47.775 --> 33:51.436
with William Phips's discovery
of the<i> Concepcíon</i> back in 1687.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.448
We know that Phips found
silver on the<i> Concepcíon.</i>

33:54.532 --> 33:56.616
Well, there's no question
about that.

33:56.776 --> 33:59.786
<i>NARRATOR:
In 1687,</i>

33:59.871 --> 34:02.447
<i>William Phips discovered
the wreck</i>

34:02.531 --> 34:05.959
<i>of the Spanish treasure galleon</i>
<i>known as the</i> Concepción

34:06.044 --> 34:08.203
<i>near the Dominican Republic.</i>

34:08.287 --> 34:12.373
<i>After salvaging nearly
100 tons of silver,</i>

34:12.458 --> 34:15.210
<i>he transported it
across the Atlantic Ocean</i>

34:15.294 --> 34:17.796
<i>to the sponsor of his mission:</i>

34:17.880 --> 34:22.050
<i>the English monarchy,
led by King James II.</i>

34:22.143 --> 34:25.303
<i>However, later that year,</i>

34:25.387 --> 34:27.397
<i>Phips conducted a second mission</i>

34:27.482 --> 34:30.642
<i>to salvage more of the</i>
Concepción's<i> sunken treasure</i>

34:30.726 --> 34:34.145
<i>with a Freemason
named Andrew Belcher.</i>

34:34.238 --> 34:38.316
<i>But this time he reported
much different results.</i>

34:38.409 --> 34:41.745
SCOTT C.: So, in September
1687, Phips returned

34:41.829 --> 34:43.988
to the wreck of the<i> Concepcíon.</i>

34:44.082 --> 34:45.332
And during the second expedition
of the treasure,

34:45.491 --> 34:47.501
Phips brought back to England
what was only valued

34:47.585 --> 34:49.410
at £10,000.

34:49.495 --> 34:53.590
He literally found 1/20
of what he found the first time.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.009
<i>NARRATOR: According
to Scott Clarke's theory,</i>

34:56.094 --> 34:58.920
<i>Sir William Phips
and Andrew Belcher,</i>

34:59.004 --> 35:01.098
<i>who owned land near Oak Island,</i>

35:01.182 --> 35:04.184
<i>used the English Crown's
support and resources</i>

35:04.268 --> 35:07.020
<i>to steal a great portion</i>
<i>of the</i> Concepción's<i> treasure</i>

35:07.105 --> 35:09.689
<i>and hide it deep
in the Money Pit.</i>

35:09.774 --> 35:14.018
<i>Is it possible that the lead
bag seal found on Lot 32,</i>

35:14.103 --> 35:16.530
<i>which Dr. Brosseau believes
could bear the markings</i>

35:16.614 --> 35:19.607
<i>of the Treasury of England,
might offer evidence</i>

35:19.692 --> 35:23.036
<i>that Scott Clarke's theory
is true?</i>

35:23.121 --> 35:26.540
If you're off-loading
a huge quantity of material

35:26.699 --> 35:28.625
that rendered a...

35:28.709 --> 35:31.536
the necessity of using
a lead bag seal,

35:31.629 --> 35:36.040
<i>it was a massive amount
of merchandise.</i>

35:36.125 --> 35:40.137
<i>Now, one has to ponder greatly,
why this type of material</i>

35:40.221 --> 35:42.472
in this quantity
on a tiny island?

35:42.631 --> 35:44.716
<i>RICK:
And Sir William Phips</i>

35:44.809 --> 35:48.395
<i>retrieved an enormous fortune
in silver.</i>

35:48.479 --> 35:52.473
<i>And the bag seal fits
well within that range.</i>

35:52.558 --> 35:56.153
<i>So, is it possible?
It's certainly interesting.</i>

35:56.237 --> 35:58.980
<i>CHRISTA:
I'm gonna allow you to see</i>

35:59.064 --> 36:01.908
<i>some of the elemental analysis
that I did,</i>

36:01.993 --> 36:04.494
<i>and this does confirm
that this is pure lead.</i>

36:04.653 --> 36:07.247
But it's important
because some bag seals

36:07.331 --> 36:09.324
<i>were made of pewter.</i>

36:09.408 --> 36:12.493
<i>The lead does not contain
any contaminants.</i>

36:12.578 --> 36:14.746
<i>There's no arsenic,
there's no antimony.</i>

36:14.830 --> 36:17.507
<i>And so, it's-it's
really quite pure.</i>

36:17.592 --> 36:19.926
Does the fact that
it's pure lead and not pewter

36:20.011 --> 36:22.086
and doesn't have
contaminants in it,

36:22.171 --> 36:25.432
does that date it
earlier or later?

36:25.516 --> 36:29.427
I would say it probably
dates it earlier.

36:29.511 --> 36:31.855
<i>Because later on,</i>

36:31.939 --> 36:34.941
more impure lead was used
or lead became recycled.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.186
<i>MARTY: This bag seal
is a very important artifact</i>

36:38.270 --> 36:39.779
because everyone
who's looked at it,

36:39.864 --> 36:42.282
including Dr. Christa Brosseau,

36:42.441 --> 36:45.285
who doesn't get too worked up
about things generally,

36:45.369 --> 36:48.780
thinks it's very old, thinks
it was phased out around 1730.

36:48.864 --> 36:52.283
In other words, phase--
At least that old.

36:52.368 --> 36:54.118
So it's significant,

36:54.203 --> 36:56.213
because that much predates
the Money Pit.

36:56.372 --> 36:58.298
Dr. Brosseau,
thank you very much.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.717
And, uh, your time
is appreciated,

37:00.801 --> 37:03.803
and your analysis and your
advice, so thank you very much.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.472
Sure, you're welcome. Good luck.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.882
<i>- Have a great day.</i>
- ALL: Thank you.

37:07.967 --> 37:09.392
<i>RICK:
Let's get back to the Money Pit.</i>

37:09.477 --> 37:11.728
<i>MARTY:
Okay, great. Let's do that.</i>

37:18.978 --> 37:20.561
- This is it.
- We're about ready to dig.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.490
The more we dig,
the more we find.

37:23.649 --> 37:25.909
<i>NARRATOR: Following their
meeting in the war room,</i>

37:26.068 --> 37:28.903
<i>Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team</i>

37:28.996 --> 37:31.331
<i>arrive back
at the Money Pit area.</i>

37:31.415 --> 37:34.242
RICK:
Just about ready, are we?

37:34.335 --> 37:36.577
Yep. We're chomping
at the bit, mate.

37:36.671 --> 37:39.831
<i>NARRATOR: Now, with
the rotating oscillator in place,</i>

37:39.924 --> 37:42.667
<i>the team's first large-scale
excavation of the year</i>

37:42.751 --> 37:46.671
<i>in the hopes of recovering
a vast cache of silver and gold</i>

37:46.755 --> 37:49.182
<i>is about to begin.</i>

37:49.267 --> 37:52.427
All right, guys, you are safe.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.512
- Okay.
- Danny's ready for you.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.764
RICK: So, this is probably
the most promising location

37:56.857 --> 38:00.101
we've ever had,
for all kinds of reasons.

38:00.185 --> 38:03.104
You know, we talk about
the Fellowship all the time,

38:03.188 --> 38:04.614
and we're all here
for the greater good.

38:04.773 --> 38:07.025
We're all here
trying to understand

38:07.109 --> 38:08.868
what this place,
this tiny island, means

38:09.028 --> 38:11.788
in-in terms of history.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.873
I think we all believe
there-there's something here

38:14.033 --> 38:15.292
that is somewhat historical.

38:15.376 --> 38:19.045
So, to that point, Doug came up
with a great idea.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.632
I think we should name the can
"The Fellowship 1."

38:22.791 --> 38:25.802
TF-1. But I also want
everybody to sign it.

38:25.961 --> 38:27.545
So...

38:27.638 --> 38:29.055
<i>I don't look</i>

38:29.140 --> 38:32.633
at Oak Island
as a succession of failures.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.644
There have been
some incredible people

38:34.729 --> 38:36.971
<i>in search of answers here.
They moved the dial.</i>

38:37.056 --> 38:38.982
<i>In the face
of all kinds of adversity</i>

38:39.141 --> 38:41.568
<i>and-and difficulties,
they persevered.</i>

38:41.727 --> 38:44.487
Well done, Billy. Well done.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.991
<i>The hope is that we can,
of course, solve this.</i>

38:48.150 --> 38:52.403
<i>But we follow in some
incredible footsteps.</i>

38:52.488 --> 38:55.832
<i>I think it's for each of us--
Meaning the Fellowship</i>

38:55.991 --> 38:58.159
<i>and those people
who continue to be intrigued</i>

38:58.243 --> 38:59.919
about the mystery--
It's for each of us

39:00.079 --> 39:01.838
to decide what our role is.

39:05.918 --> 39:07.752
The Fellowship 1.

39:07.836 --> 39:10.338
- (applause)
- But-but one more thing.

39:10.422 --> 39:12.006
One more thing.

39:12.091 --> 39:13.174
<i>Me, personally,</i>

39:13.258 --> 39:15.927
I'm fascinated and humbled
by the fact

39:16.011 --> 39:20.690
that we get to involve ourselves
in a... an enduring mystery

39:20.775 --> 39:23.101
that has lasted almost
as long as the United States

39:23.185 --> 39:24.527
has been a country.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.605
When you think about that,
it's hard not to appreciate

39:27.689 --> 39:30.950
<i>the unique opportunity
that has been presented to us,</i>

39:31.035 --> 39:33.945
<i>to solve the mystery completely.</i>

39:34.029 --> 39:37.115
"In memory of those

39:37.199 --> 39:39.534
"who have come before,

39:39.618 --> 39:45.039
we say thank you
with respect and honor."

39:45.132 --> 39:47.133
And I think
that is very appropriate,

39:47.218 --> 39:49.210
because, you know,
we have learned so much

39:49.294 --> 39:51.879
from the people
that have come before.

39:51.972 --> 39:55.392
And I'm gonna...
put a kiss there.

39:55.476 --> 39:59.053
(applause)

39:59.138 --> 40:01.648
- Okay. Let's make hole.
- I'm ready.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.641
<i>MARTY:
Well, I'm hopeful.</i>

40:03.725 --> 40:06.986
<i>TF-1 is probably the highest
expectation I've ever had</i>

40:07.146 --> 40:10.314
<i>because of the physical
presence of silver and gold.</i>

40:10.408 --> 40:11.899
<i>We've never had that before.
I mean, it's exciting.</i>

40:11.984 --> 40:13.234
<i>We've been at this
for a long time.</i>

40:13.327 --> 40:15.495
<i>We've had our ups and downs.</i>

40:15.579 --> 40:17.580
I don't want to get too excited,

40:17.739 --> 40:19.332
and I want to do
expectation control,

40:19.417 --> 40:21.251
but, yeah, we could be close.

40:21.410 --> 40:23.578
VANESSA:
Who's doing the honors?

40:23.671 --> 40:24.838
Who's starting this
thing for us?

40:24.997 --> 40:27.173
- Rick.
- Rick.

40:27.332 --> 40:29.259
- All right, sir.
- Okey doke.

40:29.343 --> 40:31.428
So, first you're gonna
turn our oscillator on.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.341
(whirring)

40:37.435 --> 40:39.769
All right, now you're gonna
go ahead and oscillate.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.192
(applause)

40:48.112 --> 40:49.863
There you go.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.023
<i>NARRATOR:
For more than two centuries,</i>

40:52.116 --> 40:55.359
<i>determined men and women
have invested their time,</i>

40:55.453 --> 41:00.531
<i>their resources and,
in some cases, their lives,</i>

41:00.616 --> 41:04.210
<i>trying to recover a legendary
treasure on Oak Island.</i>

41:04.295 --> 41:07.455
<i>Many did so based on the faith</i>

41:07.539 --> 41:10.967
<i>that extraordinary secrets were
hidden within the Money Pit.</i>

41:12.386 --> 41:15.221
<i>And now, having found
scientific evidence</i>

41:15.380 --> 41:18.308
<i>of silver and gold deep below,</i>

41:18.392 --> 41:21.302
<i>Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with their team,</i>

41:21.386 --> 41:26.557
<i>are making the boldest attempt
yet to fulfill that faith.</i>

41:26.642 --> 41:28.902
<i>The wait is over.</i>

41:29.061 --> 41:31.479
<i>The dig has begun.</i>

41:31.563 --> 41:33.481
<i>And the answers
they all have sought</i>

41:33.574 --> 41:38.161
<i>may finally be within reach.</i>

41:38.320 --> 41:40.821
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:40.915 --> 41:42.823
MARTY:
Bring it, baby.

41:42.908 --> 41:45.835
<i>RICK: There's hard
evidence that there is treasure</i>

41:45.994 --> 41:48.246
- in the Money Pit.
- MARTY: Oh, boy, look at that.

41:48.330 --> 41:49.664
- That could be part of a tunnel.
- MARTY: We understand you have

41:49.748 --> 41:51.341
- some results for us?
- It's French lead.

41:51.425 --> 41:53.426
Would that apply
to our friend the cross, too?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.094
- Most definitely.
- No kidding?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.347
ALEX: We can scan
the area for any sign

41:57.431 --> 41:58.923
of the stone road
as it heads out of the swamp.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.758
Look at that.
I think we might have found it.

42:00.842 --> 42:02.426
- A lot of wood coming out.
- Yep.

42:02.511 --> 42:03.436
GARY:
We got a good signal here.

42:03.595 --> 42:05.104
Ooh. Look at that.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.514
That's beautiful.
