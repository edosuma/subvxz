♪ ♪

00:21.488 --> 00:23.822
KALEB: The weather's
not super ideal today.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.291
But this is a
golden opportunity and

00:26.293 --> 00:29.895
I've been wanting to do
this since I was a little kid.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.031
Try and get fueled up,
get off the ground,

00:32.099 --> 00:34.466
get headed out to
the coast to hunt deer.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.905
This time of year, our
freezers are getting low and

00:39.973 --> 00:41.240
we need more meat.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.976
I'm headed out to
the Prince William Sound

00:44.979 --> 00:47.379
on an island in
the Gulf of Alaska.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.851
And my goal is to
come home with fresh venison.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.990
This is as far as
this airplane's going.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.927
I need to get into a
floatplane and, and, uh,

01:01.929 --> 01:03.128
continue the journey.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.799
It's another 15 minutes from
here and I'm in deer country.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.937
(grunts)

01:14.942 --> 01:16.942
This is the
adventure of my lifetime.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.156
And I'm officially
stuck on the island here.

01:31.225 --> 01:36.161
My ride is leaving and
it's time to set up camp.

01:36.764 --> 01:42.300
I have no way of getting off
this island until he comes back.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.870
So, start thinking
about hunting tomorrow.

01:44.889 --> 01:48.841
There's a lotta deer here
and that's what I'm after.

01:48.909 --> 01:53.445
Being alone here, there's no
contact with the outside world.

01:53.514 --> 01:57.249
It's just me,
my rifle, and the deer.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.518
And who's smarter,
me or the deer?

02:00.054 --> 02:01.753
And we will find that out.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.090
(gusting winds)

02:06.460 --> 02:09.361
(gusting winds)

02:11.532 --> 02:16.735
So far, I haven't seen any
deer this morning but, uh,

02:17.004 --> 02:20.806
I'm gonna sneak around a
couple meadows close to camp,

02:20.874 --> 02:23.575
see if anybody's
out eating some grass.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.549
I gotta get up from here, up several
hundred feet to wherever the deer are.

02:30.551 --> 02:34.152
They hang out in
these little meadows.

02:34.155 --> 02:38.357
And the play is to just
hike from meadow to meadow,

02:38.425 --> 02:41.560
and kinda glass around the
perimeter of the meadow and

02:41.628 --> 02:43.195
see if any deer are lurking.

02:44.831 --> 02:49.434
And if there are, I've gotta determine
if it's a buck, a male with horns,

02:49.503 --> 02:50.569
or a doe.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.771
I can only shoot the males.

02:52.839 --> 02:57.342
So I've gotta be really careful about
my selection of who I'm gonna harvest.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.180
But there's also
some big bears here.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.916
They feed on fish
almost year-round.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.918
I've gotta be super careful,

03:05.986 --> 03:09.588
and I gotta be aware of my
surroundings at all times to

03:09.656 --> 03:11.089
the threat of bears.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.002
Lookin' for deer.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.805
But there's a little
spruce hen right there,

03:26.824 --> 03:29.107
it's a good sign,
this place has got animals.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.544
There's game trails
everywhere here.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.014
I mean there's, it's like a, it's
like a major interchange in the city,

03:36.083 --> 03:40.686
trails going this way,
that way, that way, up that way.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.822
This is good.

03:49.346 --> 03:51.696
CHRIS: The Cosna River's
kinda like<i> Fight Club.</i>

03:51.699 --> 03:53.565
The Cosna will
knock you on your ass,

03:53.567 --> 03:56.168
but once you succeed and
you start winnin' those fights

03:56.236 --> 03:58.837
you're gonna feel pushed
and challenged at every point.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.176
Until (bleep) summer, and there's
mosquitos everywhere and I got to go.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.814
(laughs)

04:12.202 --> 04:13.385
CHRIS: Time to go.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.653
JESSI: You ready, Toze?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.187
CHRIS: Goin' for a boat ride.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.190
CHRIS: Start haulin' gear.
JESSI: Yeah.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.190
CHRIS: Looking towards summer.

04:19.193 --> 04:21.259
Got a lot of hunting
to do, a lot of fishing.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.929
We really want to go into
fall time with a lot of food.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.065
JESSI: It's hard to believe any other
place is as nice as this place right now.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.068
CHRIS: But there's no salmon
fishing and there's no caribou hunting.

04:30.070 --> 04:30.936
Ready?

04:31.004 --> 04:32.004
JESSI: Yup.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.407
CHRIS: There doesn't seem to
be any fish up at the cabin.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.275
Trapping was a little
tough on the Cosna this year.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.879
Pretty much all the lynx and martin headed
outta here, so we're just gonna pack up and

04:40.947 --> 04:43.348
head on outta here and
head for greener pastures.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.085
Down to the Tanana River, which
is just a mighty powerful river

04:47.154 --> 04:49.288
where there's really
great fishing and hunting.

04:49.356 --> 04:52.424
Everything starts with a
big river trip off the Cosna.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.425
Ready, Jess?

04:53.427 --> 04:55.894
JESSI: Um...
CHRIS: All right.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.296
Hold up.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.966
I'm trying to get down.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.634
Oh! The bank gave out.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.570
All right, go ahead and try to get
your front end in the water if you can.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.372
JESSI: Okay.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.974
CHRIS: Okay.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.309
There she is.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.145
I'll lock up the door
and let's get it started.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.650
Come on Toze.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.584
Load up.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.786
Good girl.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.589
JESSI: So, are we
pushing my end out?

05:24.658 --> 05:27.125
CHRIS: Yup.
JESSI: Here we go.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.161
Bye-bye cabin.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.598
And the stinking journey begins.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.668
CHRIS: Right side. Right side.
Right side. Right side. Right side.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.070
Yup, paddle.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.006
Kay, ease up.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.274
You feeling
comfortable up there?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.542
JESSI: No.
CHRIS: No?

05:43.610 --> 05:44.676
JESSI: Mm-mm.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.678
It's tippy, it's in the water.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.147
It's like the dead head
sticking up, but you can't see,

05:49.149 --> 05:51.216
and it's the sun's
reflection, and it's the...

05:51.284 --> 05:53.919
CHRIS: Toze is walking from
side to side of the boat.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.888
JESSI: This is gonna be
real fun when we're, you know,

05:56.957 --> 05:58.657
going through
treacherous (bleep).

06:05.832 --> 06:09.301
JOHNNY: Rarely out here do I
encounter just one problem or situation.

06:09.369 --> 06:13.972
That's what's going to test you and see
if you have what it takes to live out here.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.110
'Cause all I have is me,
that's all I have out here,

06:19.113 --> 06:21.513
myself to figure
out these problems.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.983
JOHNNY: It's warm
out here, isn't it Java?

06:25.002 --> 06:27.252
You can't handle the 60s.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.523
I cook out here a lot because
it's hot to cook inside the cabin,

06:31.591 --> 06:34.926
and rocket stoves are very
efficient and that's why I like 'em.

06:34.928 --> 06:39.931
What happens is the air just flows
through it and shoots up like a rocket and

06:40.000 --> 06:43.201
it heats up my water fast,
I can cook a lot quicker.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.604
But the problem with it is it just
burns these sticks really, really fast,

06:46.607 --> 06:48.407
and that it burns hot.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.410
You kinda need to babysit
it and feed it more often.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.012
You know, the methods I use
for cooking are very primitive,

06:54.014 --> 06:58.350
but I want to find a way I can still
do that and make it more efficient,

06:58.418 --> 07:02.287
just let the cooking cook and I can
move on and go do other projects.

07:02.355 --> 07:06.758
Uh, I think, uh, I was to build
an open oven on this platform,

07:06.760 --> 07:10.295
that would kind of open up, you
know, the different ways I can cook,

07:10.363 --> 07:11.963
the different things I can make.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.965
You know, I could
possibly make bread.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.234
Essentially, diversifying
the way I cook would, uh,

07:16.236 --> 07:18.369
open up a whole another
world out here for me.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.406
Water's boilin', so I'm
gonna make a pot of coffee.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.644
I'm gonna let this stove
cool down, finish burnin' out.

07:25.712 --> 07:29.448
That way I can move it off this
table, start buildin' that oven.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.188
All right.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.956
Uh, this looks like
a good spot to start.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.926
It's gonna be a
lotta ruts in here.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.795
I don't think it's
gonna be a easy dig.

07:45.065 --> 07:49.334
The first thing I have to do is
build a roof over this platform.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.669
That way, if it starts
raining while I'm building it,

07:51.672 --> 07:53.605
it'll be protected, and I
don't have to worry about it.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.007
Don't you go falling on me now.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.944
So, I'm gonna put four spruce
poles for my firewood pile

07:59.012 --> 08:01.046
to create a structural support.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.149
In these little wedges, spikes,

08:05.152 --> 08:07.652
they kinda just keep
it snug around this.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.022
(chainsaw humming)

08:18.098 --> 08:19.631
So, that's the notch.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.037
This is a pretty good fit.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.508
(grunts)

08:30.511 --> 08:33.511
Nice and sturdy,
that's what I'm looking for.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.446
Gonna move on to the next step,

08:34.514 --> 08:36.348
which is putting
planks all the way across.

08:38.051 --> 08:38.917
You know, I don't come in really

08:38.919 --> 08:41.052
with much of
a plan, just an idea.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.389
And I just grab tools and
I just start going after it.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.792
Just kinda let the project
evolve into what it wants to be,

08:47.861 --> 08:50.195
and that's kinda the best
way to do things for me.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.998
Good 'ol Alaskan
roof is what this is.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.267
That covers it perfectly.

08:56.270 --> 08:57.802
Roof is up.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.739
Move onto the next part, and
that's gonna be the table, here.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.141
What do you say, Java?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.243
Good life, but lotta work.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.815
CHEVIE: To survive out here,

09:10.817 --> 09:12.483
the standard is you're
gonna have a goal and

09:12.486 --> 09:14.119
you're gonna accomplish it.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.356
And the goal for us is
to get firewood for the winter,

09:18.425 --> 09:19.758
and we're gonna
accomplish that goal.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.699
ROGER: Keep your eye out.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.435
I know we got a
bunch of logs here so.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.705
CHEVIE: Right on the left-hand
side of that little opening there of grass.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.245
Holy (bleep), that's
a nice log right there.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.214
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.720
So, today me and my cousin
Roger, are gonna get out on river

09:48.788 --> 09:52.724
and see if we can find a whole bunch
of driftwood before it all floats by us,

09:52.726 --> 09:55.527
so we could get all that
firewood back to Shageluk.

09:57.714 --> 09:59.731
This is a good find right here.

09:59.799 --> 10:00.865
All right.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.267
Let's see what else this
little corner has to offer.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.336
Roger and I have known
each other for a long time.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.672
He's a good friend of
mine, and Sonta's cousin.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.875
We're gonna have to help each other
out, be able to fill his woodshed and

10:10.877 --> 10:13.077
my woodshed at the same time.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.879
The goal is 40 full trees.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.881
Something that we do
every year to ensure that

10:16.883 --> 10:19.150
our families stay
warm throughout the winter.

10:20.420 --> 10:25.423
That's your best chance of survival in
Alaska, really gotta take care of one another.

10:29.696 --> 10:30.895
Right now, we
gotta get another log.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.833
What do we got here?

10:34.851 --> 10:39.304
ROGER: That's a long tree.
CHEVIE: She looks heavy.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.838
ROGER: Strong current.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.708
CHEVIE: Yeah, just get in
there however the hell you can.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.711
Yeah, this is a big,
nice log, super dry.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.649
ROGER: Let's see if we can get
it out, it's pretty swift here.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.283
(grunts)

10:54.121 --> 10:56.654
CHEVIE: Holy (bleep).

10:56.657 --> 10:58.390
It's a lot bigger than it looks.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.725
ROGER: That is a lot
of log in the water.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.527
CHEVIE: I can't get my
arms all the way around the,

11:02.595 --> 11:05.864
the (bleep) tree,
that stump's huge.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.502
All right, we'll
give her a go again.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.005
Okay.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.875
Yeah, you hold this right there, I'll
just reach up there as far as I can.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.477
ROGER: Got it?
CHEVIE: Yeah.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.147
You got the tree and my feet?

11:23.150 --> 11:25.417
ROGER: Yeah, we ain't
leaving this log behind.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.553
(laughs)

11:28.555 --> 11:30.088
Just to let you know.

11:30.090 --> 11:34.892
CHEVIE: That didn't give me a whole
bunch o' reassurance there, cousin.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.028
ROGER: It, it all
looked good from my angle.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.364
CHEVIE: All right.
ROGER: You get it?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.599
CHEVIE: Let's see what it does.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.572
There she goes.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.643
Got her another
six inches there.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.443
All right, give her hell.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.111
Go!

11:53.179 --> 11:54.679
ROGER: I'm going.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.716
CHEVIE: Come on baby.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.787
Don't slip off of there now.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.456
Watch the log.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.523
It's a fight.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.125
Go, go, go, go.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.293
Aw (bleep)!

12:14.150 --> 12:16.017
Il be,

12:16.019 --> 12:17.419
I think she'll be coming.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.220
ROGER: Come on baby.

12:27.097 --> 12:28.897
CHEVIE: You're good.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.665
ROGER: Try the board game.

12:34.237 --> 12:37.038
CHEVIE: Hell of a deal.

12:37.107 --> 12:38.373
Hell of a deal.

12:38.441 --> 12:41.109
ROGER: I need to get turned
around and back it up some more.

12:45.782 --> 12:47.115
That was almost a struggle.

12:47.117 --> 12:48.416
CHEVIE: Almost.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.520
I would've been nervous if
anybody else was driving, cousin.

12:52.589 --> 12:56.324
ROGER: I, I knew I had it.
CHEVIE: Good job, chief.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.060
ROGER: 20 years'
experience pays off.

12:59.062 --> 13:00.562
CHEVIE: Let's go
get some more wood.

13:05.602 --> 13:08.803
Firewood doesn't only just
heat us, we have big families,

13:08.805 --> 13:12.006
both of us, you need a lot of
wood to keep the house comfortable,

13:12.008 --> 13:13.875
especially for
small kids, babies.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.677
I got a newborn on the way.

13:15.745 --> 13:17.412
What are we rolling with now?

13:17.480 --> 13:20.949
ROGER: 14, 14 logs.
CHEVIE: Nice.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.618
ROGER: The more we get,
the better off we are.

13:23.686 --> 13:25.553
CHEVIE: Still got a
(bleep) load of work to do,

13:25.555 --> 13:27.288
we're just barely
getting started here.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.289
ROGER: Yup.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.860
(snaps)

13:32.562 --> 13:33.495
JOHNNY: It's great being able to

13:33.563 --> 13:36.231
build stuff with
my own hands from the land.

13:36.299 --> 13:39.534
Not rely on
truckloads of material.

13:41.171 --> 13:42.971
Sweat equity is what I
like to put into things.

13:46.976 --> 13:49.544
JOHNNY: It's a lot more complicated
when you're not using dimensional lumber.

13:54.851 --> 13:57.552
And I'm gonna do what it
takes to build an outdoor oven.

14:00.523 --> 14:03.658
All right, so I just need to put
some logs all the way around,

14:03.660 --> 14:06.794
and pretty much just building
a sandbox on top of here.

14:08.732 --> 14:09.998
And that's gonna hold the sand.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.600
Which is gonna help insulate
this table from the hot oven

14:12.669 --> 14:14.235
that I'm building
on top of here.

14:19.409 --> 14:20.875
That's just one measure,

14:20.877 --> 14:24.946
one of a few measures to
keep it from burning the wood.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.784
Too many pounds in
this wheel barrel.

14:31.888 --> 14:32.954
(grunts)

14:32.956 --> 14:35.489
This about as
far as I'm getting.

14:35.492 --> 14:40.962
You know, when I first moved to this
property, I bought a stove from this lady,

14:41.030 --> 14:45.366
and she gave me just a
load of these firebricks.

14:45.402 --> 14:48.636
And I was like, uh, I don't
really have a use for those,

14:48.638 --> 14:50.572
and I'm glad I
hung to 'em though

14:50.640 --> 14:55.843
because these firebricks are
gonna be the base of the stove.

14:55.845 --> 14:57.578
So, this is the
second layer of protection

14:57.581 --> 15:01.449
keeping this wood fireproofed.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.252
Yeah, that's kind of the birth of the
oven, that's where it's all gonna start.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.921
So, I can cook on the
surface of these bricks,

15:06.923 --> 15:08.456
'cause this'll be
the inside of the oven.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.328
Level says, level.

15:14.397 --> 15:15.596
All right, so I can move on,

15:15.599 --> 15:18.199
start progressing toward
actually building the oven.

15:18.201 --> 15:20.067
And that's gonna
be the fun part.

15:20.070 --> 15:21.936
It'll be a long
day tomorrow too.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.438
Java, you wanna go eat?

15:27.410 --> 15:29.677
KALEB: Nature can
be a hard thing to deal with.

15:30.813 --> 15:33.681
But to live out here,

15:33.750 --> 15:36.117
I need to be able to contend
with whatever it throws at me.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.619
Otherwise, I won't survive.

15:38.622 --> 15:39.621
I won't come home.

15:43.826 --> 15:45.359
KALEB: It's nice
and sunny out today,

15:45.362 --> 15:51.065
but the woods are just wetter
than wet, so rain gear it is.

15:52.969 --> 15:56.570
I personally don't want to get
wet, even if it is a nice sunny day,

15:56.573 --> 16:00.508
so just puttin'
rain gear on the bottom.

16:02.512 --> 16:04.579
Into the woods I go.

16:07.317 --> 16:13.388
I need to successfully
find some prey and bag it,

16:13.456 --> 16:15.990
harvest it,

16:16.059 --> 16:19.393
but these deer are really
smart, and they're elusive.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.196
They're hard to see,
they're hard to find.

16:22.198 --> 16:25.866
But I've just gotta
be in the right spot,

16:25.869 --> 16:29.070
at the right time
in order to connect with one.

16:31.808 --> 16:33.508
Straight down through there.

16:43.019 --> 16:45.286
I got two deer.

16:54.163 --> 16:56.163
I see two deer up here.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.032
Um...

16:58.034 --> 17:00.301
I'm about 50% sure
one of them's a buck,

17:00.303 --> 17:01.869
I'm pretty sure I see the horns.

17:04.374 --> 17:07.308
It just raised its head up and
I'm 100% sure that's a buck.

17:07.377 --> 17:08.776
I'm gonna take a shot.

17:08.845 --> 17:10.378
'Cause it's bucks only.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.117
I have to make sure that when I
do take the shot that it's perfect.

17:23.176 --> 17:26.177
♪

17:26.245 --> 17:28.179
KALEB: Safety's on.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.448
Now, the buck did
just step out of sight,

17:30.450 --> 17:33.317
but he doesn't
know of our presence yet.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.985
So, I need to
start sneakin' up and

17:34.988 --> 17:37.755
see if I can get eyes on
that deer without spookin' it.

17:42.195 --> 17:46.030
I think one of
those deer is a buck.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.735
This is good sign.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.137
I think that was the doe,

17:53.206 --> 17:54.539
it was bedded down.

17:57.277 --> 18:01.479
Now the challenge is I've
lost sight of both deer,

18:01.481 --> 18:03.815
and once I find 'em again
I'm gonna have to determine

18:03.883 --> 18:06.551
which one's the
buck and which one is not.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.319
'Cause one of
them has no antlers.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.356
So, this just got difficult.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.161
Hunting really is just about

18:17.163 --> 18:19.630
being in the right
place at the right time,

18:19.632 --> 18:21.566
so I gotta keep
movin' around a little bit.

18:21.634 --> 18:26.303
And there's only two things that
are really important on this trip,

18:26.306 --> 18:30.174
and that is to
kill and not be killed.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.347
These fish means there's bears.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.452
I mean, here's a freaking
bear trail right here,

18:41.521 --> 18:44.388
and I'm gonna walk down it to
try and get back into clearing.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.859
All over this island there are
monster coastal brown bears.

18:48.862 --> 18:55.333
And this island has a phenomenon
known as ringing the dinner bell.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.001
When these coastal brown bears

18:57.069 --> 18:57.935
hear a gunshot,

18:57.937 --> 18:59.470
they know somebody
just killed a deer,

18:59.539 --> 19:03.474
and there's an easy free meal waiting
for them if they just go and find it.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.879
I got two deer in
my sights right now.

19:07.947 --> 19:13.551
I've gotten to about 80 yards away,
and I can see that it's for sure a doe.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.620
No antlers.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.522
And the other one is her baby.

19:19.092 --> 19:24.562
There's deer everywhere, but
this is like hunting moose,

19:24.630 --> 19:26.564
can only shoot the males.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.969
I load all this gear back
up, get back on the trail.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.440
And there's a lot
of country to cover,

19:36.442 --> 19:38.409
and I need to stay out
of the way of the bears.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.113
CHEVIE: To thrive
in this area of Alaska

19:43.116 --> 19:45.049
you can't be
cautious all the time,

19:45.117 --> 19:47.384
you can't be
scared of getting hurt,

19:47.387 --> 19:52.056
or scared of being in a situation
that you might be uncomfortable in.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.596
If I can mentally
see myself succeeding,

19:58.598 --> 20:01.299
then I'm willing to take that
challenge and push myself there.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.268
(grunts)

20:04.337 --> 20:06.203
CHEVIE: You can do it,
put your ass into it.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.940
This is the beginning of a
small raft we're gonna stage.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.275
It's damn near impossible to
do it in this kind of wind.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.011
Yeah, this must be
kinda the eye of the storm.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.947
ROGER: Yeah, we are, and it's
dark all the way around us too.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.349
CHEVIE: It is, yup.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.884
There's three long trees
right here though,

20:19.952 --> 20:21.719
this is gonna add
to this stack pretty good.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.955
So we can see the
storm's right there and

20:24.958 --> 20:26.557
you could really
feel the wind blowing out

20:26.559 --> 20:28.559
of the south,
blowing right at us.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.827
The eagle's out, isn't it?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.229
Everyday.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.433
ROGER: Get that outside log
tied up so it won't wonder.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.834
CHEVIE: Okay.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.769
ROGER: Make sure the
rope doesn't come off.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.505
CHEVIE: I kinda feel like sometimes
you're the outside log, you know,

20:41.574 --> 20:45.109
like I gotta tie it up
so you don't wander, you know?

20:45.177 --> 20:46.444
(laughs)

20:46.512 --> 20:48.779
ROGER: Oh!

20:51.968 --> 20:53.651
CHEVIE: Okay.

20:53.653 --> 20:57.188
We're gonna pull these logs straight to
those logs, so we'll have a little stash.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.658
Getting these logs
staged is time well spent.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.326
ROGER: And, and
you killed it in here.

21:05.198 --> 21:06.730
CHEVIE: We'll end up
having three rafts.

21:06.733 --> 21:10.200
One big raft up river, a
small raft in the middle,

21:10.203 --> 21:14.005
and then a
medium size raft down river.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.274
And we'll put 'em all
together as we're going home,

21:16.342 --> 21:19.476
but right now we
gotta get this wood out

21:19.479 --> 21:22.480
of the main river before it gets
super windy around the corner,

21:22.548 --> 21:24.715
and get it in a secured area.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.951
And this creek's a,
a great place to hide it.

21:35.761 --> 21:39.363
So, our biggest stash of
wood's sitting right here.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.831
This is 20 logs.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.567
It's a lot of firewood
and it's a lot of work.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.636
It's a lot of time
to get this here.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.039
ROGER: I think this
situation's gonna stay good

21:48.107 --> 21:50.107
for another
night if it needs to.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.576
CHEVIE: We're just gonna wait
for a break in the weather,

21:52.578 --> 21:54.712
put all the pieces
of the puzzle together,

21:54.780 --> 21:58.149
and make a push for
home whenever that's possible.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.524
CHRIS: The Cosna is
not one of those crystal clear,

22:06.592 --> 22:08.693
luxurious rivers
you get to float down.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.263
It's dirty, full of sweepers.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.066
It's got mud banks that are
vertical, you can't climb out of.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.667
It's got bears at every corner.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.170
The Cosna's an (bleep).

22:26.813 --> 22:28.179
CHRIS: Neutral positions.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.949
Okay, head up.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.150
JESSI: Yup.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.952
CHRIS: Split the middle and
then we're gonna cut left.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.154
Going down the Cosna's
always an experience.

22:37.223 --> 22:38.355
Right here.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.623
All right, paddle on the
right, paddle on the right.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.093
We've got sweepers.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.428
Sweepers are big trees that
are hangin' down over the river,

22:44.497 --> 22:45.629
and when you go underneath 'em

22:45.698 --> 22:47.565
they want to sweep you and
all your gear out of the boat.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.833
JESSI: Here's
another tree coming up.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.370
CHRIS: That's quite a, quite
a tree going across there.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.238
JESSI: Quite a tree.
CHRIS: All right so...

22:54.240 --> 22:55.906
JESSI: And this one has
branches that come all the way out,

22:55.975 --> 22:56.974
going all the way across.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.175
What do you wanna do?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.977
CHRIS: Cut it down.
JESSI: Yeah, let's do that.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.512
CHRIS: Okay.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.514
We don't wanna get too close to it,
'cause we don't wanna get sucked down.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.316
JESSI: In we go.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.117
Okay.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.086
(grunts)

23:10.122 --> 23:11.522
Please be careful.

23:11.590 --> 23:12.957
CHRIS: Yeah.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.394
I'd say the
Consa's far from predictable.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.401
So just 'cause the river's
knocked me down a few times,

23:23.469 --> 23:24.935
doesn't mean I'm
gonna stop trying.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.307
(chainsaw humming)

23:40.353 --> 23:43.053
(chainsaw humming)

23:50.430 --> 23:51.562
(laughs)

23:51.630 --> 23:53.297
(panting)

23:53.299 --> 23:55.566
Ah, that was a lot.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.770
To...

24:00.840 --> 24:02.039
(grunts)

24:02.041 --> 24:05.176
(panting)

24:05.244 --> 24:07.178
JESSI: Holy smokes,
look at it over here.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.646
Great job, Chris!

24:08.714 --> 24:10.581
CHRIS: Yeah, it worked,
worked out really well.

24:10.649 --> 24:13.651
But now we gotta get ahead of that, otherwise
we're gonna get jammed up behind it.

24:13.719 --> 24:15.118
Dig in.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.220
JESSI: Okay.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.910
CHRIS: All right, perfect.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.463
We just gotta make it way
down river before we camp.

24:31.737 --> 24:34.004
Lay down sweetheart.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.406
Woo-hoo-hoo!

24:37.810 --> 24:39.343
I'm tryin' Toze.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.145
Come on Toze, get under here.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.483
JESSI: This is
some serious rain.

24:45.551 --> 24:46.884
Okay, you wanna put
my submarine pants on?

24:46.952 --> 24:48.018
You want me to pull over?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.286
CHRIS: I just put
myself under the tarp.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.688
JESSI: Yeah, just tell me
what you need, we'll do it.

24:51.691 --> 24:52.756
CHRIS: I can't hear you.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.625
JESSI: Tell me what
you need, and we'll do it!

24:54.693 --> 24:55.793
CHRIS: Paddle through the rain.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.697
Paddle on your right.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.032
JESSI: Okay, hold on.
CHRIS: We're just gonna crash.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.167
We gotta paddle love!

25:03.235 --> 25:04.234
JESSI: I know!

25:04.237 --> 25:05.202
CHRIS: We're just
spinnin' in the wrong direction.

25:07.573 --> 25:08.873
Try to keep her nose straight.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.512
Everything's getting soaked,

25:14.580 --> 25:16.513
our guns and...

25:16.516 --> 25:17.648
Kay, keep it straight,

25:17.716 --> 25:19.183
I'm gonna try to
suck up the water.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.689
There's so much
water in this boat.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.618
CHRIS: Tell me if you need me.

25:37.620 --> 25:40.354
JESSI: I don't, I'll be okay.
CHRIS: I can't hear you.

25:40.356 --> 25:42.156
JESSI: All is well!

25:48.297 --> 25:51.231
CHRIS: Oh, it just
poured right on my (beep).

25:51.234 --> 25:52.700
JESSI: Our canoe
has been sliding and

25:52.768 --> 25:55.435
slithering down this
serpent of a river for days.

25:55.438 --> 25:57.905
We have been going through
all these obstacles and

25:57.907 --> 26:00.708
just making our way down
this serpent of a river,

26:00.776 --> 26:03.443
making our way through
the belly of the beast.

26:03.446 --> 26:05.946
And hopefully, we make
it out on the other side.

26:09.852 --> 26:11.718
JOHNNY: I don't
like to overthink something.

26:11.721 --> 26:13.453
I don't like to over-plan.

26:13.456 --> 26:16.990
Because the blueprints
are something to follow.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.559
And I'm not much of a follower.

26:25.401 --> 26:29.603
JOHNNY: So in order to
have this dome-shaped oven,

26:29.605 --> 26:31.672
I need to have a mold.

26:31.740 --> 26:35.809
And I'm gonna build a mold
on top of this out of sand.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.613
So I'm gonna make a dome
and I want the sides to be

26:39.682 --> 26:41.481
kinda as
vertical as possible and

26:41.484 --> 26:43.150
that's gonna give me
the most interior height.

26:43.152 --> 26:46.553
16, 18 inches tall.

26:46.555 --> 26:50.824
And, uh, it's gonna start
drying out pretty quick.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.359
And when it dries out,
it's just gonna crumble.

26:52.361 --> 26:57.364
So what I'm gonna do is take
some old newspapers I found.

26:57.433 --> 27:00.434
15 years old.

27:00.502 --> 27:02.102
That'd be kinda fun to read.

27:02.104 --> 27:03.370
Dip it in a bucket of water.

27:05.241 --> 27:09.043
And that's gonna
hold that moisture in.

27:09.111 --> 27:12.112
Oh,<i> The Departed</i>
is in, uh, theaters.

27:12.314 --> 27:16.250
All right, so the paper is all
the way around the sand mold.

27:16.318 --> 27:18.252
It's gonna hold the moisture in.

27:19.722 --> 27:24.458
And I'm just gonna give it one last little
drink before I walk away to go grab the cob.

27:25.728 --> 27:29.396
Java, I wish I'd could figure out a
way for you to drag the cob over here.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.797
You know, hold your weight.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.232
Don't wanna interrupt your nap.

27:34.403 --> 27:37.271
That cob mix is what
I have here on my land.

27:37.339 --> 27:41.208
Sand, clay,
there's straw, water.

27:41.210 --> 27:42.009
This stuff's heavy.

27:42.011 --> 27:43.477
It's not lightweight.

27:43.479 --> 27:46.680
Turn these all into a nice
mixture and make an oven.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.149
Man, this is awesome 'cause
I've been thinking about doing

27:49.218 --> 27:51.085
this before I
even moved to Alaska.

27:51.153 --> 27:53.286
And it's just so cool
to be doing all the things

27:53.289 --> 27:57.290
I thought I wanted to
do before I moved here.

27:57.293 --> 28:00.828
Yeah, I was sitting and
daydreaming at any job I'd have like,

28:00.896 --> 28:05.432
"Man, I wish I was
building a cob oven," or

28:05.434 --> 28:09.136
"I wish I was just barefoot
walking around on my property."

28:10.506 --> 28:12.206
It's kind of just sealing it.

28:12.241 --> 28:14.975
It's almost like a seal coat.

28:14.977 --> 28:17.878
Now it's time to start
excavating out all of the sand.

28:19.382 --> 28:20.581
Here we go.

28:20.649 --> 28:21.848
All right.

28:21.851 --> 28:25.386
The sand's still pretty damp
from when I built this thing.

28:25.454 --> 28:31.225
Starting a fire inside is gonna
complete the drying process.

28:37.333 --> 28:38.899
There we go, that's
what I needed to do.

28:40.336 --> 28:43.270
(bleep) yeah,
that thing's blazing.

28:43.272 --> 28:47.474
I'm gonna prop the door and that's
gonna complete the drying process.

28:47.543 --> 28:50.010
And move onto finding
something to put into this oven.

28:50.746 --> 28:51.945
CHEVIE: We're gonna go for it.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.213
Stuff's coming together.

28:53.282 --> 28:55.149
Or coming apart, one of the two.

28:55.751 --> 28:58.085
Our work that
Roger and I do together,

28:58.153 --> 28:59.820
a lot of it's mental.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.688
Once you're in it,
you're in it to win it.

29:01.757 --> 29:05.625
And having humor to keep you
going is a really good trick.

29:05.628 --> 29:08.162
Just gotta maintain
a positive attitude.

29:08.230 --> 29:09.830
ROGER: Positive attitude.

29:09.832 --> 29:12.499
CHEVIE: Doing anything we can
to keep a smile on our faces

29:12.501 --> 29:13.834
because we know that the work

29:13.836 --> 29:17.104
that we're doing at the moment's
kinda (beep) suck work at times.

29:20.442 --> 29:21.908
CHEVIE: Ready to
hook up to the back?

29:21.911 --> 29:23.477
ROGER: Ready to
hook up to the back.

29:27.650 --> 29:30.184
CHEVIE: Okay, there you go.

29:31.253 --> 29:35.522
Chief picked a good spot here
to dock her out of the wind.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.791
But right now it's
better than it was yesterday.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.259
It's not pissing rain.

29:39.328 --> 29:40.994
We're not in the
middle of a storm.

29:41.063 --> 29:42.663
It's not black all around us.

29:42.731 --> 29:44.064
Our visibility's better.

29:44.133 --> 29:47.400
There is still some wind, but
it's dying down just a little bit.

29:47.403 --> 29:48.602
It's rougher than we'd like.

29:48.604 --> 29:49.803
It's still windy.

29:49.872 --> 29:53.073
But, um, we're just gonna have
to work with what we got today.

29:53.142 --> 29:54.608
We're ready to
get these logs home.

29:54.676 --> 29:56.877
It's a lot of firewood,
that's for damn sure.

29:56.879 --> 29:59.079
It's, uh, 28 logs right there.

29:59.148 --> 30:01.081
We're still learning
how to count, cousin.

30:01.150 --> 30:03.416
ROGER: I only count up to 20.

30:03.419 --> 30:06.553
(laughter)

30:06.622 --> 30:09.857
CHEVIE: We got another raft to
pick up about five miles from here.

30:11.360 --> 30:15.095
And then one more another
three or four miles below that.

30:15.164 --> 30:19.566
Hopefully we can get all three
rafts tied together and, um,

30:19.635 --> 30:21.434
pushed into Shageluk.

30:21.437 --> 30:23.770
ROGER: I'm still a little
worried about the wind.

30:23.772 --> 30:28.842
But I would like to get
it all done in one sweep.

30:29.979 --> 30:31.645
CHEVIE: I hear ya.

30:31.713 --> 30:34.648
We're gonna have to unhook and
get ready to get our next raft.

30:37.986 --> 30:40.053
So we released 28 logs.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.855
The 28 logs come down the river,

30:41.857 --> 30:44.525
we go down in front, and
hook up six, seven logs

30:44.593 --> 30:47.661
and we should meet 'em together
and be able to hook up and

30:47.729 --> 30:51.732
keep going down river towards
Shageluk without wasting any time.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.733
Timing's gotta be just right.

30:53.736 --> 30:58.238
Once this raft goes by, we
don't want to have to chase it.

30:59.542 --> 31:01.008
Bad (beep) can happen.

31:01.076 --> 31:04.344
I worry more about that than falling
in the water or anything like that.

31:08.417 --> 31:11.151
This is really
gonna be a real test.

31:11.220 --> 31:14.421
The risk to reward,
the risk to reward.

31:14.489 --> 31:16.256
ROGER: Yeah.

31:17.359 --> 31:18.625
CHEVIE: Kay, we
got eight logs here.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.027
We're gonna get
hooked up to them.

31:22.364 --> 31:24.264
ROGER: Little bit of wind.
CHEVIE: Little bit of wind.

31:26.501 --> 31:27.367
Okay.

31:27.436 --> 31:29.369
We're good, cousin.

31:31.773 --> 31:35.108
You don't have as much room
for error right now, so, uh,

31:35.177 --> 31:36.643
you know, let's
get pushing, huh?

31:39.514 --> 31:41.047
I think down there, man.

31:41.050 --> 31:42.649
ROGER: Oh, yeah.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.784
CHEVIE: Holy (beep), there.

31:44.787 --> 31:45.852
There they are.

31:45.921 --> 31:47.588
We can't let that raft
get way out in front of us.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.855
If we get behind the eight ball,

31:48.857 --> 31:51.325
we'll be chasing it
all the way to town.

31:51.393 --> 31:52.926
It turns into a
real pain in the ass.

31:52.928 --> 31:55.061
Think we can
pull it off, cousin?

31:55.064 --> 31:57.731
ROGER: I ain't holding back.
CHEVIE: Haul ass.

31:57.799 --> 31:59.199
It's getting real, real quick.

32:04.523 --> 32:05.923
♪

32:05.991 --> 32:07.190
CHEVIE: We're dealing
with a lot of wood here.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.126
The wind's really
blowing like hell.

32:09.194 --> 32:12.462
And, uh, we just gotta get these
things tied together where,

32:12.464 --> 32:13.864
as tightly as we can.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.067
You're hitting on
the back right there.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.069
You got it?

32:19.071 --> 32:21.538
ROGER: Yeah.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.573
Let the line go a little bit.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.880
It's a lot of wood
to be dealing with.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.283
(laughs)

32:33.285 --> 32:35.218
CHEVIE: You wanna add 16 to it?

32:35.220 --> 32:37.688
ROGER: Well, let's see how
I'm feeling with this big load.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.633
KALEB: Once I shoot an animal,

32:49.701 --> 32:52.703
the hard work starts
with 60 pounds of meat.

32:52.771 --> 32:55.138
Fresh, bloody, juicy, bear bait.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.642
Inviting all of the bears.

32:59.979 --> 33:04.781
As a hunter, I have to be very
careful about staying out of harm's way.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.920
KALEB: Out in these woods,

33:09.988 --> 33:14.591
it's kind of a big game of Russian
roulette for the deer and for me.

33:15.661 --> 33:20.330
The deer are doing their
darndest to stay alive.

33:20.399 --> 33:23.333
I'm doing my darndest
to stay alive because

33:23.335 --> 33:26.136
I'm not the
top predator in these woods.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.471
I've got a gun for the deer.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.073
I've got a gun for the bears.

33:30.092 --> 33:33.743
And I'm hoping to beat the odds on
this island because I have not killed,

33:33.746 --> 33:36.113
but I do not want to be killed.

33:39.351 --> 33:42.753
At the end of the day, we're
all just trying to survive here.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.831
I just saw another little doe.

33:56.301 --> 33:59.102
Not what I'm looking for, but
one of these days it'll be a buck.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.705
There she goes.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.141
Have a nice life, deer.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.651
So that's just the way it goes.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.319
This is hunting, not shooting.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.790
And, uh, you just gotta deal with
the problems when they come.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.725
Okay.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.694
Got some mussels here.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.266
I'm not doing too
well hunting deer.

34:29.334 --> 34:34.971
But these mussels
don't run away.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.808
So I can grab 'em,
collect enough of 'em,

34:38.811 --> 34:42.112
there'll be some
little tasty bites in here.

34:42.131 --> 34:45.482
When you see a resource.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.217
I think I got a pot in my pack.

34:47.285 --> 34:49.686
Reach out and
grab it while you can.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.022
I kinda feel like a
brown bear pawing through

34:53.025 --> 34:54.891
the rocks here looking for food.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.827
Oh, oh, crab.

34:56.895 --> 34:59.696
Have a little
impromptu seafood buffet.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.631
This will be a good dinner.

35:02.968 --> 35:06.236
Ultimately, the deer
outsmarted me on this trip.

35:06.304 --> 35:08.037
Their will to
survive was stronger.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.240
And I'm okay with that.

35:10.308 --> 35:15.245
And I still get to eat food
that I pull off of the land.

35:16.582 --> 35:17.647
Ha, here's a good one.

35:22.438 --> 35:23.987
JESSI: It's spring
coming into summer.

35:23.989 --> 35:27.857
The fish aren't here and
pretty much every other animal

35:27.860 --> 35:29.926
is out of season to hunt.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.796
And we're looking for
anything that we can eat, really.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.865
Anything that
will fill our boat and

35:34.933 --> 35:37.033
fill our bellies for the
upcoming weeks is good for us.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.438
CHRIS: Wind's blowing this way.

35:41.457 --> 35:42.606
JESSI: Okay.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.249
CHRIS: Beaver.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.020
That's a big beaver.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.955
It's going right up there.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.090
You can see him there.

36:01.093 --> 36:02.759
You can shoot him as he goes by.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.427
It'll take him about
half an hour to float.

36:04.496 --> 36:08.365
We'll get the canoe, come in here,
and you can pick up a, a beaver.

36:09.968 --> 36:12.202
Then we'll be set
for the next week.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.106
He's trying to be territorial.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.640
Get comfortable.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.242
Adjust your bipod.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.544
You've got time.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.448
If it's not a
good spot, find a good spot.

36:29.254 --> 36:32.589
JESSI: I see him just like
sitting over there like a crocodile.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.890
This is wild.

36:33.926 --> 36:35.258
CHRIS: (inaudible) trip.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.460
JESSI: Bedded down in (beep)
bear country looking for a beaver.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.031
CHRIS: Maybe it's
gotten wise to us.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.402
JESSI: Oh, (beep)!

36:46.405 --> 36:47.837
CHRIS: Where's he at?
JESSI: He's up there.

36:47.873 --> 36:48.939
CHRIS: Across the river?

36:49.007 --> 36:50.207
Shoot.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.411
Move really slow.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.019
Square him right behind
the ears and like hit him

37:03.088 --> 37:04.220
in the spine or the brain.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.689
JESSI: Yeah, but I don't
have a clear view of his face.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.891
He's gotta come
back down, right?

37:08.894 --> 37:10.693
CHRIS: Yeah, I mean it's
nice that he's up there.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.828
JESSI: Okay.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.996
CHRIS: If you have an okay shot.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.201
JESSI: (bleep), where'd he go?

37:20.705 --> 37:23.039
CHRIS: Here he comes.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.644
JESSI: I'm taking the shot.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.450
(gunshot)

37:34.453 --> 37:35.518
CHRIS: You got it!
You nailed it.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.319
JESSI: Did I?

37:36.388 --> 37:37.454
CHRIS: Yeah, you
(beep) nailed it.

37:37.522 --> 37:38.454
Let's get around the other side.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.522
JESSI: Safety on,
safety on, safety on.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.724
CHRIS: Leave it there.

37:40.792 --> 37:41.858
Let's go.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.193
Around the other side
of the lake, let's go.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.061
JESSI: I'm not
leaving the (beep) gun.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.195
You kidding me?

37:46.198 --> 37:47.230
CHRIS: Come on.

37:54.422 --> 37:56.489
CHRIS: Good (beep) shot, baby.

37:56.558 --> 37:59.092
Why are you bringing that?

37:59.160 --> 37:59.959
We're gonna have to carry.

37:59.962 --> 38:00.560
JESSI: What if
there's a (bleep) bear?

38:00.629 --> 38:01.695
CHRIS: I have a (beep) 50.

38:01.763 --> 38:05.365
Leave it, you need to carry it.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.901
Let's go. Let's go.

38:08.770 --> 38:10.103
JESSI: There are bears here.

38:10.105 --> 38:11.438
CHRIS: C'mon.

38:11.506 --> 38:12.772
JESSI: There's
probably three bears

38:12.774 --> 38:16.576
looking at me right now
wishing that they had this beaver.

38:16.645 --> 38:17.444
Here...

38:17.512 --> 38:19.779
CHRIS: Yeah, I
just saw blood, so...

38:19.781 --> 38:21.915
Awesome.

38:21.983 --> 38:23.450
JESSI: We did it.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.251
Thank you, beaver.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.786
We appreciate you.

38:26.788 --> 38:27.988
CHRIS: Perfect shot.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.789
I can't believe it's right below
the ear, right into the head.

38:29.791 --> 38:31.191
Killed it instantly.

38:31.259 --> 38:33.259
That's the quickest
beaver death I've seen.

38:33.261 --> 38:35.662
JESSI: We appreciate
everything you gave up.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.197
We appreciate you.

38:37.265 --> 38:38.598
CHRIS: Good shot.
JESSI: Appreciate your life.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.600
CHRIS: We should take him down
to the riverbank to clean him.

38:40.669 --> 38:41.601
JESSI: That's
what I was thinking.

38:41.670 --> 38:42.936
CHRIS: And I'll bring
the boat, the boat up.

38:43.004 --> 38:46.740
JESSI: Okay, so I'll
get him cleaned out.

38:46.808 --> 38:48.207
God, thank you so much, beaver.

38:48.210 --> 38:50.210
(crashing)

38:52.881 --> 38:54.814
CHRIS: Shh, I just
heard a crash in the woods.

38:59.688 --> 39:00.954
Get that beaver.

39:01.022 --> 39:01.754
We gotta get moving.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.022
JESSI: Okay.

39:03.025 --> 39:05.291
CHRIS: I don't wanna
deal with a bear too.

39:05.293 --> 39:07.327
Scared the (beep) out of me.

39:09.030 --> 39:10.230
We are deep in bear country.

39:10.298 --> 39:12.198
We gotta get back to our
boat as quick as possible.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.409
JOHNNY: It's the
magic moment now.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.978
What we've been waiting for.

39:26.448 --> 39:29.449
A pot of bear meat that I just
cooked brought out of my oven.

39:31.186 --> 39:33.053
It's hot.

39:38.460 --> 39:39.659
Oh, yeah.

39:39.728 --> 39:40.660
Man, that looks good.

39:40.662 --> 39:42.195
Falling off the bone.

39:42.263 --> 39:43.863
You know, it takes a long
time to be able to do this.

39:43.865 --> 39:46.833
And I'm cutting my cooking
time in half with that oven.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.671
Have myself a little
fancy dinner tonight.

39:51.673 --> 39:53.740
Kinda celebrate this new oven.

39:57.546 --> 40:00.346
It's like all that hard
work and effort I put in,

40:00.415 --> 40:02.415
my body is just
thanking me so much with

40:02.484 --> 40:04.283
all this meat and
protein right now.

40:04.286 --> 40:08.221
You know, I need fuel
like this to keep me going.

40:08.223 --> 40:09.255
Here you go.

40:18.233 --> 40:20.967
KALEB: As this
hunt draws to a close,

40:21.035 --> 40:24.971
I'm reminded that I don't
always have to kill something

40:25.039 --> 40:26.906
in order to be a mighty hunter.

40:26.975 --> 40:30.576
Sometimes just going out in
the woods is what's needed.

40:30.579 --> 40:33.413
And these are amazing.

40:36.718 --> 40:39.219
Oh, dang, that was good.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.595
And I will miss this place.

40:48.663 --> 40:51.397
And I cannot wait to
come back here next year,

40:51.399 --> 40:55.668
next hunting season, with
more knowledge, more skill.

40:55.737 --> 40:59.239
So next time will
be a different story.

41:06.347 --> 41:07.680
CHRIS: Been one heck of a trip.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.082
Came a long ways
down that river.

41:09.150 --> 41:11.885
That tight little Cosna
to the wide-open Tanana.

41:13.555 --> 41:14.487
JESSI: It's pretty amazing.

41:14.556 --> 41:15.621
We did it.

41:15.624 --> 41:16.489
CHRIS: Oh, yeah.

41:16.491 --> 41:17.824
Nice and smoky.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.293
It's perfect fire
for cooking beaver.

41:20.295 --> 41:22.996
I've been waiting to just
chomp into this thing, man.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.801
JESSI: Worth it?
CHRIS: Oh, man.

41:29.304 --> 41:30.370
JESSI: Oh, wow.

41:30.438 --> 41:31.971
Yeah.

41:31.973 --> 41:33.105
Oh, it's juicy.

41:33.108 --> 41:34.373
CHRIS: Like a
smoked turkey leg, huh?

41:34.376 --> 41:35.975
JESSI: This is delicious.
CHRIS: Yeah.

41:35.977 --> 41:39.512
There's no funky
beaver-y skunky flavor at all.

41:39.581 --> 41:40.980
JESSI: No! Mm-mm.

41:42.651 --> 41:45.518
CHRIS: We had a lean winter, so
I'm gonna hit this summer hard.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.521
JESSI: Maybe some burbot?
Maybe some whitefish?

41:48.523 --> 41:49.655
CHRIS: Yeah.

41:49.658 --> 41:51.991
Whatever we can catch
we'll smoke up and we'll dry,

41:51.993 --> 41:55.461
and we'll eat and, we got a lot of
hunting and fishing to do this summer.

41:55.463 --> 41:58.531
JESSI: I knew that it wasn't gonna
be easy, but I knew that it'd be worth it.

41:58.533 --> 42:00.867
CHRIS: Oh, yeah.

42:00.935 --> 42:04.170
It blows my mind that not everybody
would just want to run off into the woods.

42:09.411 --> 42:11.811
CHEVIE: All right, Roger
and I made it into town.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.880
But pushing this much weight,

42:13.882 --> 42:18.284
the next big feat here is parking
this barge at the, uh, boat landing

42:18.353 --> 42:21.221
where we need to stage these
logs before we pull 'em up.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.623
Sounds a lot easier than it is.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.291
ROGER: We'll see what happens.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.559
Hope for the best.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.294
Expect the worst.

42:28.363 --> 42:32.899
CHEVIE: I'm gonna keep my (beep)
mouth shut, let Chief focus,

42:32.967 --> 42:34.634
and put us in there.

42:34.702 --> 42:36.302
And there's my beautiful wife!

42:36.371 --> 42:37.637
Go ahead and tie it, Sonta!

42:37.705 --> 42:39.238
ROGER: Safely.

42:39.241 --> 42:42.575
CHEVIE: She's gotta get us tied
off fast or else this whole raft will spin

42:42.577 --> 42:44.911
until our boat's
hitting that bridge.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.513
'Cause the water's so high our
boat won't go underneath the bridge.

42:47.515 --> 42:49.749
So we don't want to rip
off the top of the boat.

42:55.991 --> 42:57.456
Have her tie it
right there, huh, cousin?

42:57.459 --> 42:59.592
ROGER: Yeah.
CHEVIE: Sonta's going in.

42:59.594 --> 43:01.060
Sonta's going in the water.

43:01.062 --> 43:03.596
SONTA: I have excellent balance.
CHEVIE: Seven months pregnant.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.999
SONTA: I'm an old pro,
pregnant or not.

43:06.067 --> 43:07.600
CHEVIE: All right, so
everything's tied up.

43:07.602 --> 43:10.469
ROGER: Perfect.
CHEVIE: We're here.

43:10.472 --> 43:12.204
We brought these logs 30 miles.

43:12.207 --> 43:13.406
Everybody's safe.

43:13.408 --> 43:14.807
Happy to see the family.

43:14.809 --> 43:16.542
The kids are here.

43:16.544 --> 43:19.479
You have to have firewood to heat your house
throughout the whole winter and now we got it.

43:19.547 --> 43:22.882
Other years we got 25,
26 logs and split it.

43:22.884 --> 43:25.084
And this year we're
actually splitting 56 so.

43:25.086 --> 43:26.619
ROGER: 56.
SONTA: Oh, nice.

43:26.621 --> 43:28.087
CHEVIE: So it's a lot of wood.

43:28.156 --> 43:30.490
Big accomplishment here.

43:30.558 --> 43:33.893
It's nice to be able to measure
your success by hard work and

43:33.962 --> 43:35.761
develop these
relationships with people

43:35.764 --> 43:39.098
like Roger to help get
big projects like this done.

43:39.167 --> 43:43.469
'Cause we understand each other's value to
one another living a lifestyle like this.

43:44.238 --> 43:45.505
SONTA: Good job, guys.

43:45.573 --> 43:47.106
CHEVIE: Ryder, you wanna
help me start splitting,

43:47.108 --> 43:49.242
cutting and splitting some
firewood and loading it in the truck?

43:49.310 --> 43:51.811
RYDER: Yeah.
CHEVIE: All right.

43:53.581 --> 43:55.314
JOHNNY: Alaska is
the playing field and

43:55.317 --> 43:58.518
what you choose to do with
Alaska is entirely up to you.

43:59.854 --> 44:02.054
CHRIS: And what we've learned is
when you push really, really hard and

44:02.057 --> 44:04.457
you feel like the whole
world's given up on you and

44:04.459 --> 44:06.993
you just push a little bit
harder, you will be rewarded.

44:07.195 --> 44:10.796
KALEB: Everything that I learned
on this trip I will be able to

44:10.799 --> 44:14.934
use on future trips to help
amp up my odds of success.

44:14.936 --> 44:20.473
CHEIVE: Alaska is and always will be my
home because it feeds my need for adventure.
