WEBVTT

00:00.051 --> 00:01.609
Come back here!

00:04.889 --> 00:07.221
We were cleaned out.
We've been hit.

00:07.291 --> 00:09.225
Nobody hits a lady.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.227
Anybody got your rent?

00:11.295 --> 00:13.490
Have you ever thought about
trying to buy the place?

00:13.564 --> 00:15.122
Why don't you go back to work?

00:20.704 --> 00:25.266
It wasn't my fault.
Some jerk put the beer - In the aisle.

01:59.770 --> 02:01.670
<i>Somebody once
described great art...</i>

02:01.739 --> 02:03.536
<i>as "an improvement
on perfection."</i>

02:04.108 --> 02:07.669
<i>I can"t remember
if it was Picasso or Higgins.</i>

02:07.745 --> 02:11.078
<i>I felt the satisfaction of the
artist with my improvement...</i>

02:11.148 --> 02:13.742
<i>on the simple perfection
of the beer can.</i>

02:13.851 --> 02:17.252
<i>"This wasn't just a stack of
cheap six-packs. Here we had...</i>

02:17.321 --> 02:20.916
A study in Day-N-Dark Extra
Light <i>by T. Magnum...</i>

02:21.325 --> 02:22.587
<i>signed and dated.</i>

02:22.660 --> 02:25.094
Magnum, that'll last
about 10 minutes.

02:25.763 --> 02:27.788
You've got the beer
curving out into the aisle...

02:27.865 --> 02:30.265
where some klutz
is bound to knock it over.

02:30.334 --> 02:33.235
Look, Magnum, if you must
play at being an employee...

02:33.304 --> 02:34.931
at least try to be convincing.

02:35.005 --> 02:37.940
Okay, fine, so you don't
like me being here, fine...

02:38.008 --> 02:39.600
but don't blow my cover.

02:40.044 --> 02:41.636
I'm doing my best to look legit.

02:41.712 --> 02:44.943
Legit Day-N-Dark employees
do not waste their time...

02:45.015 --> 02:47.415
trying to make beer cans
look like Rodin.

02:47.484 --> 02:50.180
Rodin? You really think
it's that good?

02:50.254 --> 02:51.846
I really think...

02:51.922 --> 02:54.390
that I am really upset
that our corporate brains...

02:54.458 --> 02:57.723
chose to put a beach boy turned
private eye into my store.

02:57.795 --> 02:59.854
Now, hold on. I am-
That I cannot change.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.363
But, I can remind you...

03:01.432 --> 03:03.764
that you were not commissioned
to do a sculpture...

03:03.834 --> 03:06.632
you were hired to investigate
the robberies.

03:06.704 --> 03:08.763
So, investigate.

03:18.182 --> 03:22.812
It wasn't my fault.
Some jerk put the beer - In the aisle.

03:23.387 --> 03:24.786
Yes, I know.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.115
Get the mop, Magnum.
Your sculpture's leaking.

03:31.161 --> 03:33.561
I want
a strawberry cup-a-dream.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.625
Please.

03:36.533 --> 03:37.761
Please.

03:49.546 --> 03:51.446
And some more quarters.

04:03.961 --> 04:05.553
Have a nice day.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.662
No, wait!
Come back with my quarters.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.766
Come back here!

04:17.274 --> 04:18.935
Jeanie, look what you're doing.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.738
What's he doing?

04:29.920 --> 04:33.549
Are you all right? Anybody
hurt? Oh, no, no. We're fine.

04:33.691 --> 04:36.819
What have
they done to my display?

04:36.894 --> 04:40.523
Oh, it's not their fault. It's the
kid and that guy in the Street Rod.

04:40.597 --> 04:42.997
Are you ladies all right?
Should I call an ambulance?

04:43.067 --> 04:46.935
Oh, no. No, we're all right. I'm
awfully sorry. I meant to hit the brake.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.503
You're getting all wet.
Oh, well...

04:50.574 --> 04:53.099
Look, if you'll take care of the
ladies, I'll go call the police.

04:53.177 --> 04:54.405
Police?

04:54.478 --> 04:57.709
Nobody is going anywhere, until I
find out who's responsible for this.

04:57.781 --> 05:01.945
I told you, the guy with the - We
are taking the total responsibility.

05:02.019 --> 05:04.010
Oh, you don't have to do that.
It's not your fault.

05:04.088 --> 05:05.521
Did you get a license number?

05:05.589 --> 05:07.318
No, the guy peeled out of here.
- Oh!

05:07.391 --> 05:08.688
Look, Miss Wilcox...

05:08.759 --> 05:12.695
it was a 1969 Camaro
Street Rod, electric blue.

05:12.763 --> 05:14.390
Now, how many of those
are there on the island?

05:14.465 --> 05:16.592
No, wait. I think the car
was green.

05:16.667 --> 05:20.159
Yes, I'm sure of it. Teal
would be more precise, Madge.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.636
No, it was blue.

05:21.705 --> 05:23.400
That-that loud
glow-in-the-dark paint.

05:23.474 --> 05:26.443
I think it just looked blue
in the sunlight.

05:26.944 --> 05:29.936
Teal has a funny way of-
Name?

05:30.280 --> 05:31.907
What are you doing?

05:31.982 --> 05:35.008
I have to fill out a report
for Day-N-Dark. It's procedure.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.109
Procedure?

05:36.186 --> 05:38.677
Miss Wilcox, we're
getting drenched out here.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.621
LaSalle.
What?

05:41.058 --> 05:43.686
LaSalle. Our name.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.924
Capital L-A-
I know how to spell it.

05:46.997 --> 05:49.659
Miss Wilcox, you take care
of the really important stuff.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.600
I'm gonna call the water department
and get that thing shut off...

05:52.669 --> 05:55.661
then I'm gonna call the police
before the guy in the Camaro-

05:55.739 --> 05:59.334
Are you sure it was a Camaro?
All these cars look so much alike.

05:59.410 --> 06:01.970
I'm sure.
Of course, you're sure.

06:02.045 --> 06:05.139
But it doesn't really matter because
we're taking total responsibility...

06:05.215 --> 06:08.514
for all of the damages. Good.
Name of insurance company?

06:08.585 --> 06:13.045
Do you think you could call us a
taxi? I think the engine's flooded.

06:18.228 --> 06:20.355
Look, don't you worry
about a thing.

06:20.431 --> 06:23.889
I'm going to personally see to it that
we find that guy with the Street Rod.

06:23.967 --> 06:24.991
Oh, no, no.

06:25.068 --> 06:27.468
Now, we've decided
that we're not really sure...

06:27.538 --> 06:29.631
about the make of the car...

06:29.706 --> 06:33.608
and, besides, we don't want to
get involved with anything awkward.

06:33.677 --> 06:34.837
But it wasn't your fault...

06:34.912 --> 06:37.210
and you don't have to get
involved. I'll be discreet.

06:37.281 --> 06:39.579
See, I'm a private investigator.

06:40.050 --> 06:41.881
Bless your heart.
What?

06:41.952 --> 06:43.886
Don't give up your dreams.

06:43.954 --> 06:47.685
Madge wanted to be a ballerina,
I wanted to be a pilot.

06:47.758 --> 06:51.888
You want to be a private investigator,
be a private investigator.

06:51.962 --> 06:55.295
No, no, no. Listen, 19 of
those Day-N-Dark stores...

06:55.365 --> 06:58.823
have been robbed in the last three
months. No M.O., no clues, no nothing.

06:58.902 --> 07:01.564
They just turn around,
and the money is gone.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.572
So I'm there to investigate.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.972
That's what investigators do,
you understand?

07:06.043 --> 07:07.567
Of course.

07:07.711 --> 07:10.111
Only don't let it interfere
with your job.

07:16.253 --> 07:17.845
Well...

07:20.457 --> 07:23.620
This is it.
It's quite a mess.

07:23.727 --> 07:27.356
But, then, old troupers
are used to roughing it.

07:27.431 --> 07:28.420
Troupers?

07:28.499 --> 07:32.333
Nearly all of us here were
in the business. Entertainers.

07:32.402 --> 07:36.930
Jeanie and I were actresses for a
while. Can't you come in for a minute?

07:37.007 --> 07:39.635
Oh, no, I've got to get back.
Oh, just for five minutes?

07:39.710 --> 07:40.836
For milk and cookies?

07:40.911 --> 07:44.108
We'd love to give you
something for bringing us home.

07:44.181 --> 07:45.808
Well, five minutes.

07:56.660 --> 08:00.824
Hello, everybody.
Jeanie, did you get him?

08:00.964 --> 08:02.056
Yes.

08:02.499 --> 08:06.094
Johnny, at least you could
comment on our news.

08:06.169 --> 08:09.661
We wrecked the car.
Okay. Okay.

08:11.174 --> 08:13.870
Oh, Herman, here's your music.

08:21.485 --> 08:25.012
I got Larry
Parrish. That's the whole team.

08:26.323 --> 08:28.917
Texas Ranger fan?
Parrish.

08:28.992 --> 08:31.222
I've been trying to get
this card for months.

08:31.295 --> 08:34.525
It's too bad we didn't meet
sooner. I've got two Parrishes.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.225
You got any Tigers up for trade?

08:36.299 --> 08:38.894
Are you kidding?
Who collects Detroit?

08:38.969 --> 08:42.405
Wait a minute. I collect
Detroit. Then you got a problem.

08:45.242 --> 08:49.076
All right. I'll save you
my Detroit stuff. Thanks.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.514
How can they get the nerve to
call this "The Game of the Week"?

08:52.583 --> 08:54.710
Seattle versus Minnesota.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.379
Dull, but never mind.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.752
My kid's sending me the money
to get cable.

08:59.823 --> 09:02.815
Oh, Johnny, it came.

09:03.894 --> 09:06.886
The money from your son.
Really?

09:07.331 --> 09:09.959
I don't suppose
he sent you your rent?

09:15.672 --> 09:17.537
Anybody got your rent?

09:17.941 --> 09:19.306
Rent money?

09:20.644 --> 09:23.135
Just one of you.
It'll make my day.

09:28.352 --> 09:31.219
Oh, no. Mr. Cole, please.

09:33.256 --> 09:35.053
This is right on half a month,
Johnny.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.683
You're still a month
and a half behind...

09:36.760 --> 09:38.591
and he's the closest
to being paid up.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.256
I guess you're the landlord?
No, I'm not the landlord.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.595
I'm Harvey Cole,
the agent for the owners.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.329
Who are trying to sell this
place right out from under us.

09:46.403 --> 09:49.304
They're not even gonna carry you
that long. The owners have decided...

09:49.373 --> 09:51.432
that they would rather have
the place empty...

09:51.508 --> 09:54.409
than to pay the electric bill
for a bunch of deadbeats.

09:54.478 --> 09:58.608
You all have till after the Labor
Day weekend to get paid up...

09:58.682 --> 10:01.981
or hit the street.
Mr. Cole, no.

10:02.052 --> 10:04.987
That's only three days.
Three and a half...

10:05.422 --> 10:08.550
and between you all,
you owe $1,800.

10:08.759 --> 10:09.953
$1,750.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.757
Come on, Harvey,
that's his cable money.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.456
They don't hook up cable
to a park bench...

10:14.531 --> 10:16.226
which is where
he's gonna be on Tuesday.

10:16.299 --> 10:19.894
I'll save you the trouble of
telling the rest of the sponges.

10:28.278 --> 10:29.677
What a dump!

10:30.213 --> 10:32.044
No wonder, they can't sell it.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.651
I hear that.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.221
Jeanie...

10:45.929 --> 10:48.090
do any of you have
the back rent money?

10:48.165 --> 10:52.101
Tommy, you're being indelicate.
No. I'm being realistic.

10:52.169 --> 10:54.034
How do you expect to pay,
for the damages you did...

10:54.104 --> 10:55.969
when you're having
trouble meeting the rent?

10:56.039 --> 10:59.236
Tommy, we have auto insurance.

10:59.309 --> 11:01.869
We do not have rent insurance.

11:01.945 --> 11:03.469
Now, really, this is
none of your affair...

11:03.547 --> 11:05.174
so why don't you go
back to the store...

11:05.248 --> 11:07.842
before somebody misses you.
Now, come on.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.579
Go on, Tommy, go.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.390
<i>"I felt as if I'd just
been to my family reunion.</i>

11:14.558 --> 11:17.356
<i>I knew everybody in that hotel
room by a different name.</i>

11:17.427 --> 11:19.861
<i>Even Harvey, reminded me
of my Uncle Richie...</i>

11:19.930 --> 11:23.229
<i>kind of the black sheep of our family
who made his living playing cards.</i>

11:23.300 --> 11:26.895
<i>Anyway, even though Madge and
Jeanie had an unerring knack...</i>

11:26.970 --> 11:29.905
<i>for making me feel like a
10-year-old, I wanted to help them out.</i>

11:29.973 --> 11:32.407
<i>I mean, everybody should do
their bit in a family crisis.</i>

11:32.476 --> 11:35.639
<i>So, I spent the rest of the
day driving by garages...</i>

11:35.712 --> 11:37.680
<i>that serviced high-performance
Street Rods.</i>

11:40.484 --> 11:42.577
<i>I know what you"re thinking,
and you"re right.</i>

11:42.652 --> 11:45.746
<i>My chances of running across that
car were next to impossible...</i>

11:45.822 --> 11:48.154
<i>but my Uncle Richie
always told me...</i>

11:48.225 --> 11:50.693
<i>"Expect to get lucky
and you will."</i>

11:59.136 --> 12:00.535
Hey, man...

12:01.571 --> 12:03.163
don't mess with my car.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.266
Your car? Were you
at the Day-N-Dark on Kuhio?

12:45.347 --> 12:49.443
Tommy, it's quite theatrical,
but not very logical.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.679
Jeanie... I don't think
the man in the teal car...

12:51.754 --> 12:54.951
meant to harm you in any way.
Jeanie, please...

12:56.292 --> 12:58.817
would you mind
not calling me Tommy?

12:59.462 --> 13:02.488
Tommy is a little boy
with an all-day sucker.

13:02.565 --> 13:07.059
Tommy, please. Please, dear,
come and sit down.

13:12.475 --> 13:15.672
Your career goals
are important to you.

13:15.745 --> 13:17.645
You know, your detective thing.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.408
So, it's quite understandable...

13:19.482 --> 13:22.144
that you wish to turn
a harmless prank...

13:22.284 --> 13:25.481
into a television drama.
It wasn't a prank.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.249
The guy who caused
your accident just-

13:27.323 --> 13:30.588
Gave you a bad paint job.
Yes, you've said that.

13:30.659 --> 13:34.095
So, did you ask the owner
of the garage...

13:34.163 --> 13:37.155
if he knew the man in the
teal car? Blue. It was blue...

13:37.233 --> 13:38.894
and there was no one else there.

13:38.968 --> 13:40.993
Then you should have waited
for someone to come back.

13:41.070 --> 13:45.234
Why come here? Because I
thought you might be interested.

13:45.307 --> 13:49.175
Fine, fine, never mind.
It doesn't matter.

13:49.445 --> 13:52.243
Because
I have the license number...

13:52.314 --> 13:54.179
of the Street Rod
and I'll just...

13:55.551 --> 13:57.075
Wait a minute.

13:57.186 --> 14:00.587
It was "M.'M-E...

14:01.557 --> 14:02.819
M- E-A...

14:06.529 --> 14:07.757
Herman!

14:11.867 --> 14:15.894
The carpenter will be here at 10:00
on Monday to fix the stair railing.

14:16.038 --> 14:20.099
Don't want anyone to hurt yourself
when you're moving your stuff out.

14:20.176 --> 14:22.906
I'm deadly serious, people.
Tuesday.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.246
This receipt for the $50
I got yesterday, Wells.

14:28.317 --> 14:31.684
I was wrong. You're still
two months behind.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.723
Wells? No wonder,
he's a Texas Ranger fan.

14:45.501 --> 14:49.164
Johnnie, you know,
the Rangers are okay, but...

14:50.005 --> 14:51.870
I lived in Virginia...

14:52.041 --> 14:55.204
and I don't think I ever got over
the Senators leaving Washington.

14:55.277 --> 14:56.539
Oh, come on.

14:56.612 --> 14:59.513
The wisest thing they ever did
was moving the franchise to Texas.

14:59.582 --> 15:01.812
The Senators were never great. No.

15:01.884 --> 15:05.376
No, but they had some pretty
good ball players over the years.

15:05.454 --> 15:10.357
Walter Johnson, Frank Howard,
Mickey Vernon and a second baseman...

15:10.426 --> 15:11.916
named Johnnie Wells.

15:13.896 --> 15:15.420
I saw you play.

15:16.432 --> 15:19.060
It was June 10, 1952.

15:19.134 --> 15:21.034
It was the second
major league game I ever saw.

15:21.103 --> 15:23.128
Did I have a good day?
"O" for four.

15:23.205 --> 15:26.003
But you got on twice.
It was an error and a walk...

15:26.075 --> 15:28.134
and you-you pulled off
a couple of miraculous steals.

15:28.210 --> 15:31.043
That was the year you led the
league with 46. You hit 381.

15:31.113 --> 15:34.708
No, no, no. 281.
I never hit over 300.

15:34.783 --> 15:37.251
Johnnie, I got your card.
It's on the back.

15:37.319 --> 15:39.253
You got that card?
Yeah.

15:39.321 --> 15:43.781
That's the one. The misprint.
It says 381 instead of 2.

15:43.859 --> 15:47.556
Oh, man, are you lucky. That
little jewel's worth over $50.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.728
I sold mine last year.

15:51.934 --> 15:54.129
You sold your own card?
Yeah.

15:54.970 --> 15:59.532
For $50 worth of spending money,
huh, I should be sentimental?

16:00.009 --> 16:03.103
Diabetes. Every little bit helps.

16:05.781 --> 16:07.908
Whee!
Another home run.

16:10.085 --> 16:11.313
Girls...

16:12.688 --> 16:14.417
how long has this place
been on the market?

16:14.490 --> 16:15.684
Almost a year.

16:15.758 --> 16:20.024
Which means it's not exactly the
hottest listing in town, am I right?

16:20.095 --> 16:21.221
So...

16:22.064 --> 16:25.397
have you ever thought about
trying to buy the place?

16:25.501 --> 16:29.301
Tommy, what a nice suggestion.
Why don't you go back to work?

16:29.371 --> 16:30.565
No, no, just listen to me.

16:30.639 --> 16:35.508
You have to come up with $1,800
by Tuesday, regardless, right?

16:35.577 --> 16:38.045
So, instead of using the money
for the rent...

16:38.180 --> 16:40.705
you just walk in,
make a viable bid...

16:40.783 --> 16:43.013
with earnest money, and the
owners are bound to jump at it.

16:43.085 --> 16:47.419
With business logic like that, you'll
never be President of Day-N-Dark.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.288
It could work.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.291
We're all on rigid
fixed incomes here.

16:52.962 --> 16:55.590
And we're not fund raisers.

16:55.998 --> 16:58.091
Would you like to meet a guy
who is?

16:59.802 --> 17:02.794
LaSalle, that name seems
so familiar to me.

17:02.871 --> 17:07.308
Of course we do carry the name
of a famous French explorer...

17:07.376 --> 17:09.742
and of a very fine car.

17:10.244 --> 17:12.679
Both dead for some years now.

17:13.182 --> 17:16.378
Yes, of course.
Well...

17:16.719 --> 17:19.551
But, we've never met?

17:19.821 --> 17:23.622
Oh, I'm sorry, no. I feel
confident we would remember.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.089
Yes, of course.

17:25.160 --> 17:29.563
Ladies, let me just say that I am
most sympathetic to your plight.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.156
However, Magnum's suggestion
that we hold a Bingo Bazaar...

17:32.234 --> 17:36.534
on the Robin Masters' estate is
out of the question, I'm afraid.

17:36.672 --> 17:38.902
Of course, Mr. Higgins.

17:38.974 --> 17:43.001
We tried to talk him out of it,
but Tommy does get so excited.

17:43.078 --> 17:45.205
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.007
Now if we could stage an event
with a proper decorum...

17:49.084 --> 17:51.075
perhaps a bridge tournament
at the Yacht Club-

17:51.153 --> 17:53.451
One! One.

17:54.223 --> 17:57.021
M- E-A 1. Two more to go.

17:57.092 --> 18:00.960
Oh, dear, are we back to
the man in the hot Rod again?

18:01.030 --> 18:04.329
Tommy, wouldn't you like
to go outside and play?

18:07.870 --> 18:11.601
What a beautiful volume.
Poetry?

18:11.874 --> 18:15.275
No, it's nothing really.
Just a little diary I keep.

18:15.878 --> 18:17.675
Wonderful penmanship.

18:18.981 --> 18:22.781
<i>The Crisis in the Suez</i>
by Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.145
Just a little diary?
Well...

18:25.220 --> 18:29.919
Yes, I do like to jot down my past
remembrances from time to time.

18:29.992 --> 18:33.519
My husband was in the Suez
during the trouble there.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.493
Good heavens, what was
his name? Gordon Archer.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.397
My God.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.195
He had that effect
on many people.

18:41.470 --> 18:43.836
I only knew your husband
by reputation.

18:43.906 --> 18:46.636
But Gordon Archer
was legendary in his own time.

18:46.809 --> 18:48.777
I was very proud of him.

18:49.044 --> 18:52.844
And we had
such wonderful times together.

18:53.148 --> 18:56.515
I remember one particularly
exciting experience...

18:56.585 --> 19:00.749
crossing the Zambezi, just
north of the Mozambique Channel.

19:00.823 --> 19:03.758
Archer was risking everything
to take me to safety.

19:03.826 --> 19:04.850
Madge...

19:04.927 --> 19:07.418
Magnum, how incredibly rude,
even for you.

19:08.497 --> 19:10.522
I'm sorry, Madge,
but it's Saturday.

19:10.599 --> 19:12.829
We have to raise the money
by Tuesday.

19:12.901 --> 19:15.461
Madge tells stories like
you tell stories, Higgins.

19:15.537 --> 19:16.697
One story apiece...

19:16.772 --> 19:18.433
and we're non-stop
into Wednesday afternoon.

19:18.507 --> 19:21.271
It is impossible to arrange a
bridge tournament by Tuesday.

19:21.343 --> 19:23.811
So, invite the same
philanthropic people...

19:23.879 --> 19:27.337
who play "tax deductible'bridge
over to play "tax deductible'bingo.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.112
The only difference will be
instead of trumping or bidding...

19:30.185 --> 19:33.382
you put cute little kernels
of corn on a piece of paper.

19:33.489 --> 19:34.717
Please?

19:36.558 --> 19:40.221
Even though I never met Gordon Archer,
we stood inches apart one evening...

19:40.295 --> 19:42.229
as we fought for our very lives.

19:42.297 --> 19:44.822
Higgins! Tuesday.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.734
Magnum, we will have the bingo
gala, Monday afternoon at 1:00.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.168
Now, please go
and find something to do.

20:12.327 --> 20:15.421
Thank you.
Keep that Day-N-Dark smile.

20:22.905 --> 20:24.702
Pickled egg, please?

20:26.542 --> 20:28.305
T.C., no.

20:29.011 --> 20:31.036
Come on, can't you come up
with another joke?

20:31.113 --> 20:33.013
I mean, three days in a row.

20:33.081 --> 20:35.606
Besides, you know I hate to
fish those stinky things out.

20:35.684 --> 20:38.118
I hate them.
Pickled egg, please.

20:57.172 --> 21:00.471
What the hell are you doing? We
have a store full of customers.

21:00.542 --> 21:04.034
Why aren't you watching them? Because
I'm watching this, Miss Wilcox.

21:04.112 --> 21:05.739
Please, not now.

21:10.886 --> 21:12.046
There.

21:14.923 --> 21:16.288
$.59.

21:17.426 --> 21:20.361
How stupid of me.
I must've forgotten my wallet.

21:26.301 --> 21:27.393
T.C.!

21:30.572 --> 21:32.130
Come back here.

21:32.641 --> 21:33.835
Magnum.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.506
Fifty-nine cents.

21:40.349 --> 21:42.977
Come on, guys, cut the
fifth grade comedy routine.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.542
Day-N-Dark was hit for
the 20th time this morning.

21:45.621 --> 21:47.555
Here?
No, not here. I was here.

21:47.623 --> 21:51.059
It was store number 27
on the Lia. The same as usual.

21:51.126 --> 21:53.492
The cash register was
emptied out without a clue...

21:53.562 --> 21:54.790
the customers were clean.

21:54.863 --> 21:58.697
Well, I guess, you got to get to
the other stores more often, T.M.

21:59.101 --> 22:01.899
That's it. Great cover.

22:02.337 --> 22:04.305
You can drop into
any Day-N-Night...

22:04.373 --> 22:06.466
as the official
pickled egg pronger.

22:07.709 --> 22:11.509
That's cute, T.C. Real cute.
Rick, what about Ice Pick?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.946
What about him?
Well, Ronnie's speed shop?

22:14.016 --> 22:16.610
You promised me he'd lean on the
owner, for info on his employees.

22:16.685 --> 22:18.915
Thomas, Ice Pick wants a fee.

22:19.121 --> 22:21.089
How much?
Well, it's really nothing.

22:21.156 --> 22:23.624
He just wants an invite
to your bingo game. What?

22:23.692 --> 22:26.354
Oh, come on, Thomas,
it means a lot to Ice Pick.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.362
He used to be a bingo caller
in the old days...

22:28.430 --> 22:30.591
and he wants to be seen
at a function like this.

22:30.666 --> 22:33.897
No, not Ice Pick. Rick, this
is strictly a class event.

22:33.969 --> 22:37.132
You know, the Higgins Hot 100.
Okay, just forget it.

22:37.205 --> 22:39.765
No Ice Pick invite, no info.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.869
Follow that car.

22:45.714 --> 22:46.874
Right!

22:49.117 --> 22:53.315
And Rick... Hey, Rick!
Rick, I wanna go with you!

22:53.655 --> 22:56.351
You don't know why
I want you to follow him!

22:56.425 --> 22:57.551
Rick!

23:10.605 --> 23:13.096
I want four quarters...

23:13.208 --> 23:15.802
and the price of a tank full
of Strawberry Dream.

23:15.877 --> 23:19.608
I wasn't stealing from the
jar. I was just making change.

23:19.681 --> 23:22.115
Oh, yeah? How do you make
change for four cents?

23:22.184 --> 23:23.515
Magnum?
What?

23:23.585 --> 23:24.882
I've got the little thief.

23:27.356 --> 23:28.687
No, you don't.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.519
Pay up.

23:34.696 --> 23:36.721
Please, mister.
Don't hit me anymore.

23:36.798 --> 23:38.993
I'll do anything you say,
but just don't hit me.

23:39.067 --> 23:40.591
Hey, you hit the kid?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.398
No, of course not.

23:42.571 --> 23:45.506
Yes, he did, sir,
but it wasn't his fault.

23:45.574 --> 23:50.307
I was stealing for my pregnant
sister. She's got nothing to eat.

23:50.379 --> 23:53.212
Oh, come on.
Did you hit the kid?

23:53.281 --> 23:54.771
No, he hit me.

23:54.950 --> 23:56.144
Magnum!
What?

23:56.218 --> 23:58.209
This is the sister?
No.

23:58.286 --> 24:00.083
Miss Wilcox, will you
please explain to him...

24:00.155 --> 24:01.679
that I did not hit this brat.
What?

24:01.757 --> 24:03.554
We've been robbed.
Where'd he go? What?

24:03.625 --> 24:06.093
Hey, Skeeter,
got a real pervert here.

24:06.161 --> 24:07.560
He hits kids.

24:07.629 --> 24:11.622
With you standing right here solving the
cookie jar crime, we were cleaned out.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.533
The cash register's empty.
We've been hit.

24:14.970 --> 24:19.407
You hit the kid and the lady? Of
course not. Nobody hit anybody.

24:19.474 --> 24:21.374
Yes, we were. Just now.

24:23.779 --> 24:28.478
Nobody hits a lady. He bothers
you again, you come and see me.

24:30.485 --> 24:32.919
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

24:32.988 --> 24:36.446
You've made a mess of everything. Me?

24:36.525 --> 24:39.153
Wait a minute, will you?
Just hold all the customers...

24:39.227 --> 24:40.626
I'll question them.

24:40.695 --> 24:43.220
Surprise.
There's nobody in there.

24:59.913 --> 25:01.744
<i>"Failure's a funny thing.</i>

25:01.815 --> 25:03.976
<i>A baby learns to walk
by falling down.</i>

25:04.184 --> 25:06.652
<i>A child learns to swim
by almost drowning.</i>

25:06.854 --> 25:10.221
<i>And what kid hits the ball the
first time he swings a bat?</i>

25:10.390 --> 25:11.550
Aha!

25:12.226 --> 25:14.820
<i>So, why is it that
the older we get...</i>

25:14.895 --> 25:17.728
<i>the harder it is to deal
with the lessons of failure?</i>

25:17.798 --> 25:21.996
<i>Right after the robbery, the
Day-N-Dark head office advised me...</i>

25:22.069 --> 25:23.730
<i>that I was fired.</i>

25:25.205 --> 25:28.197
<i>But I still had some people
who were counting on me...</i>

25:28.275 --> 25:31.210
<i>including a great base stealer
in a squeeze.</i>

25:32.913 --> 25:35.973
<i>It made the momentary failure
easier to handle.</i>

25:41.021 --> 25:44.388
Magnum, there you are. We've run
into a bit of a snag, I'm afraid.

25:44.458 --> 25:47.222
Higgins, this is much more
important than your Bingo Bazaar.

25:47.294 --> 25:48.886
There's a problem
with the bingo party?

25:48.962 --> 25:51.226
Nothing that can't
be resolved. Thomas...

25:51.298 --> 25:53.732
Just a second. You are
still planning on having it?

25:53.800 --> 25:56.598
Of course, but Agatha's having
difficulty finding the corn kernels...

25:56.670 --> 25:58.001
for the bingo tokens.

25:58.071 --> 26:01.006
I risk life and limb to get this
license plate number for you...

26:01.074 --> 26:03.406
and you wanna talk corn?
You got the number?

26:03.477 --> 26:05.411
I lost him halfway to Pearl,
but I got it.

26:05.479 --> 26:08.039
Agatha came up with what I
consider a charming suggestion.

26:08.115 --> 26:10.208
Simple little pearl buttons.
That's wrong.

26:10.284 --> 26:11.808
I think "wrong"
is a bit of an overstatement.

26:11.885 --> 26:14.115
I know you were very specific
in requesting corn. Maize.

26:14.187 --> 26:17.213
But I think the buttons would do quite
nicely. No, no. He got the wrong number.

26:17.291 --> 26:19.851
You chased the wrong car.
Oh, sure. It's my fault.

26:19.927 --> 26:22.293
Maybe the guy changed plates, or
maybe he's got a matching set...

26:22.362 --> 26:23.590
of '69 Street Rods.

26:23.664 --> 26:26.997
All I know is, this is the number
of the car you told me to follow.

26:27.067 --> 26:28.762
Imitation pearl, of course.
They're relatively-

26:28.835 --> 26:30.769
All right, you're right.
Splendid.

26:30.837 --> 26:33.135
There's gotta be an explanation.
I don't think that's necessary.

26:33.206 --> 26:36.334
I'll call Agatha right away. Oh,
yeah, Higgins. You take care of that.

26:36.410 --> 26:39.538
Listen, can you get me the registration?
How am I supposed to do that?

26:39.613 --> 26:40.671
Ice Pick.

26:40.747 --> 26:43.375
I'm afraid he didn't get an
invitation to the Bingo game.

26:43.450 --> 26:44.815
Higgins. Higgins.

26:46.453 --> 26:49.684
You really do have to invite a
fellow named Ice Pick to the party.

26:49.756 --> 26:52.088
I'm terribly sorry, but the
guest list is complete...

26:52.159 --> 26:54.252
and I'm not familiar
with the name Ice Pick.

26:54.328 --> 26:57.354
A pseudonym for a shy patron?
Yeah, something like that.

26:57.431 --> 26:59.922
He's from an old,
established Chicago family...

27:00.000 --> 27:02.434
and he's willing to make
a sizeable donation.

27:02.502 --> 27:04.766
Really? Which family?

27:04.838 --> 27:08.137
Their name is very respected.
They're big in cement.

27:10.277 --> 27:13.212
Just have him here at 1:00
in formal attire.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.374
Now, if you will both
excuse me...

27:16.450 --> 27:19.681
I have something really
important to take care of.

27:27.894 --> 27:30.863
What sort of a man
chooses the name Ice Pick?

27:37.170 --> 27:40.230
Isn't it terrific?
It arrived late last night.

27:40.507 --> 27:42.441
Has to be from my kid.

27:42.509 --> 27:45.842
Did I tell you he still
lives in Washington? Yeah?

27:47.481 --> 27:49.642
Hey, Johnnie...

27:49.716 --> 27:54.244
I've got a little gift for you, too,
I mean, it can't compare with the TV, but...

27:58.125 --> 27:59.888
My '52 card.
Yeah.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.689
The misprint.

28:01.762 --> 28:05.892
No, go on, take it back. Don't
go around giving away $50.

28:05.966 --> 28:09.129
No, I'm getting a million
out of giving it to you.

28:09.202 --> 28:11.170
Just don't sell it.
Sorry.

28:11.238 --> 28:13.934
This card is worth
two months of cable.

28:14.908 --> 28:17.433
Johnnie, I've kept that card
for over 30 years.

28:17.511 --> 28:20.742
Yeah, I know,
and you go on keeping it.

28:21.782 --> 28:25.616
For you, this is a prize
possession. That means a lot to me.

28:26.386 --> 28:29.617
But all it is
to Johnnie Wells is $50.

28:41.234 --> 28:44.397
Why, my dear,
not working this afternoon?

28:44.471 --> 28:45.995
I was fired.

28:46.073 --> 28:49.270
Well, I'm sorry to say it,
I'm not surprised.

28:49.976 --> 28:53.070
You must end your involvement
with our problems.

28:53.146 --> 28:54.773
We're doing just fine.

28:54.848 --> 28:58.477
Now, call Miss Wilcox and
tell her that you're sorry...

28:58.552 --> 29:01.180
and that you really want
to do better.

29:05.058 --> 29:07.891
Have your kicks, Herman,
it doesn't get to me.

29:08.995 --> 29:12.829
Will you look at that?
Do you believe it?

29:12.933 --> 29:15.128
Okay, Johnnie, it goes.
No.

29:15.202 --> 29:18.831
Come on. Harvey,
that TV is not going anywhere.

29:18.905 --> 29:21.373
His son gave it to him.
So?

29:21.441 --> 29:25.138
I got my orders, and these
guys with me got a big truck.

29:25.212 --> 29:28.010
We're here to get the piano
that Herman's nephew bought...

29:28.081 --> 29:30.242
the recliner that David's
ex-agent bought...

29:30.317 --> 29:34.481
and the brand new $500 TV set
that Johnnie's son bought.

29:35.922 --> 29:39.289
The owners said, "confiscate."
The owners can't confiscate.

29:39.359 --> 29:41.987
It's illegal.
This'll say it's legal.

29:43.130 --> 29:46.429
Thought they had until
Tuesday? Read it and weep.

29:46.633 --> 29:49.227
How do I know this is real?
Call your lawyer.

29:49.302 --> 29:50.894
We don't have a lawyer.

29:50.971 --> 29:52.199
Aw.

29:52.272 --> 29:55.207
We can't call a lawyer,
Harvey. It's Sunday.

29:55.408 --> 29:58.775
Start with the piano,
then the TV. Harvey.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.865
Thank you.

30:55.802 --> 30:57.531
<i>All right, everyone...</i>

30:57.604 --> 31:02.303
<i>"get your cards and your buckets
ready, and let"s begin.</i>

31:02.375 --> 31:06.106
How is it going, Higgins? Splendidly,
considering your Mr. Ice Pick...

31:06.179 --> 31:08.170
cancelled on us
at the last moment.

31:08.248 --> 31:10.978
We're just fortunate Agatha
was available to fill in.

31:11.051 --> 31:14.043
Yeah, well, he felt real bad
about that. He had to fly out.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.747
Contract dispute.

31:16.323 --> 31:18.120
So, what's the take?

31:18.792 --> 31:19.884
The "take"?

31:19.960 --> 31:23.396
I think we're all wondering if
we've reached the 3,000 mark.

31:23.463 --> 31:27.797
Well, the total at this hour is $32,000
- $32,000?

31:29.836 --> 31:31.167
What?
Oh.

31:34.841 --> 31:38.174
Thank you, Mr. Higgins.
We don't know what to say.

31:38.245 --> 31:41.612
Well, that's just the total without
taking into account the debit factor.

31:41.681 --> 31:44.241
The grand prize still has to
come out of the gross receipts.

31:44.317 --> 31:46.512
$10,000.
$10,000!

31:48.655 --> 31:52.751
Higgins, why? The grand prize
is for the coverall finale.

31:52.826 --> 31:54.623
The winner must cover
every number on the card.

31:54.694 --> 31:56.662
That's crazy.
It'll take all day.

31:56.730 --> 32:00.962
The numerical possibilities allow for
a game of 45 minutes at the outside.

32:01.034 --> 32:04.367
I assume you'll both be
purchasing cards? No, not me.

32:04.437 --> 32:07.201
Like I told Madge and Jeanie,
I never win at these things.

32:07.274 --> 32:10.971
Mr. Calvin, it's for a
good cause. It really is.

32:14.180 --> 32:18.412
<i>Under the "G" as
in George, 51.</i> Bingo.

32:18.752 --> 32:22.279
<i>Bingo! Oh, how wonderful.
We have a winner.</i>

32:24.090 --> 32:25.284
<i>Congratulations.</i>

32:25.358 --> 32:28.259
<i>"Thank you, Agatha,
you"ve done a superb job.</i>

32:34.467 --> 32:36.958
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?</i>

32:37.037 --> 32:40.200
<i>"It's time for the grand
finale of the Bingo Gala.</i>

32:40.273 --> 32:41.934
<i>This will be
the coverall novelty match...</i>

32:42.008 --> 32:43.532
<i>in which the winning player...</i>

32:43.610 --> 32:47.137
<i>must cover every number on the
card, not just a single line...</i>

32:47.213 --> 32:49.113
<i>for a grand prize of $10,000.</i>

32:50.450 --> 32:53.749
<i>"Is everyone seated

33:00.260 --> 33:01.750

33:01.828 --> 33:04.194
<i>Under the "G," 51.</i>

33:04.264 --> 33:07.529
<i>Odd, I once had occasion to
use that exact combination...</i>

33:07.600 --> 33:10.899
<i>in connection with a secret
code in a fleet of submarines.</i>

33:18.578 --> 33:21.604
<i>I had the misfortune of landing in
the middle of a herd of goats...</i>

33:21.681 --> 33:24.809
<i>during the second World War
when Clive Krefting...</i>

33:24.884 --> 33:27.944
<i>the pilot was rendered
unconscious, by a gunshot wound.</i>

33:28.021 --> 33:30.888
<i>Although, I had no previous
training in landing such an aircraft...</i>

33:30.957 --> 33:32.686
<i>I did manage to...</i>

33:37.430 --> 33:40.991
<i>"But, perhaps, this isn't the
time for such recollections.</i>

33:41.601 --> 33:43.228
<i>That was B-13.</i>

33:43.770 --> 33:46.261
Forty-five minutes
on the outside...

33:46.339 --> 33:49.604
just inside of four hours.
This must be a world record.

33:49.776 --> 33:52.244
<i>Please watch your cards.
We must have a winner.</i>

33:52.312 --> 33:54.075
<i>N-37.</i>

33:54.614 --> 33:56.081
N-37.

33:56.850 --> 33:58.943
N-37!
You won?

33:59.018 --> 34:01.578
T.C., you won. N-37.

34:03.423 --> 34:04.583
I won?

34:07.894 --> 34:09.121
"N-37."

34:12.165 --> 34:13.359
I won.

34:18.638 --> 34:20.036
I won!

34:20.106 --> 34:23.371
I never won anything, since I won
an Ellery Queen decoder ring...

34:23.443 --> 34:24.670
when I was seven years old!

34:24.744 --> 34:27.507
$10,000!

34:27.580 --> 34:29.480
I won! I won!

34:29.549 --> 34:31.574
Look, you know, I've always
wondered what I would do...

34:31.650 --> 34:33.482
if I came into
a large sum of money.

34:33.553 --> 34:36.386
Maybe, I'll make
the down payment on a house.

34:37.290 --> 34:41.158
<i>A down payment on a new helicopter,
or maybe expand my business.</i>

34:41.226 --> 34:44.161
<i>Travel. Rio, Mardi Gras.</i>

34:53.273 --> 34:57.175
<i>"But, shoot. If I did that,
I"d have to come up with...</i>

34:58.311 --> 35:00.404
<i>a whole new bunch of dreams.</i>

35:01.915 --> 35:05.282
<i>"So, if it's all the same
with you guys...</i>

35:06.019 --> 35:09.011
<i>I"d rather give
my $10,000 prize...</i>

35:09.522 --> 35:12.719
<i>to the Fountainbleu Residence
Purchase Fund.</i>

35:14.160 --> 35:15.149
Oh.

35:27.974 --> 35:31.375
$39,617.

35:35.515 --> 35:38.609
<i>Those little failure clouds
were starting to blow away.</i>

35:38.685 --> 35:40.346
<i>"True, I'd lost a day
and a half...</i>

35:40.420 --> 35:42.479
<i>trying to track down
Madge and Jeanie"s property...</i>

35:42.555 --> 35:44.785
<i>but, finally, I"d hit pay dirt.</i>

35:44.858 --> 35:46.826
<i>The goods were on their way
back to the hotel.</i>

35:46.893 --> 35:48.258
<i>And in about an hour...</i>

35:48.328 --> 35:51.456
<i>I would take Madge and Jeanie to put
a down payment on the Fountainbleu.</i>

35:51.531 --> 35:54.295
<i>The only dark cloud
left was the Day-N-Dark robberies.</i>

35:54.367 --> 35:57.461
<i>"I knew there was a thread somewhere,
something simple that I"d overlooked.</i>

35:57.537 --> 35:59.300
<i>But I couldn"t think
what it was.</i>

35:59.372 --> 36:01.670
<i>Yeah, Thomas,
I heard from Ice Pick.</i>

36:01.741 --> 36:03.208
<i>He got the registration
on the car.</i>

36:03.276 --> 36:06.268
Yeah? <i>Only thing is,</i>
<i>it"s kind of weird.</i>

36:06.346 --> 36:09.144
<i>It doesn"t make any sense.</i>
What? What?

36:09.215 --> 36:11.683
<i>The Camaro belongs to a guy
named Billy Princeton...</i>

36:11.751 --> 36:16.085
<i>but here"s the weird part</i>, <i>the plates
on it belon</i> g <i>to a"38 Caddy...</i>

36:16.155 --> 36:20.285
<i>and it"s registered to a Jeanine
K. And Margaret L. LaSalle.</i>

36:22.362 --> 36:25.661
<i>A "38 Caddy and it's
registered to a Jeanine K...</i>

36:25.732 --> 36:27.427
<i>and Margaret L. LaSalle.</i>

36:27.667 --> 36:30.295
<i>Thomas, those are
the LaSalle sisters.</i>

36:34.456 --> 36:37.857
Perhaps the plates were stolen
from Madge and Jeanie's car.

36:38.527 --> 36:42.156
It doesn't make sense. He
nearly runs two ladies over...

36:42.230 --> 36:44.130
and then tracks them down
and steals their plates?

36:44.199 --> 36:45.188
I see your point.

36:45.267 --> 36:47.701
Madge and Jeanie did not
want me to trace that car.

36:47.769 --> 36:49.168
They know the guy.

36:49.237 --> 36:52.070
Who are you calling?
The LaSalle sisters.

36:54.609 --> 36:57.407
<i>Hello?</i>
Johnnie? It's me, Tommy.

36:57.479 --> 36:59.709
May I speak to Madge
or Jeanie for a minute?

36:59.781 --> 37:01.408
Magnum, aren't they with you?

37:01.483 --> 37:04.145
I haven't seen them since
before the bingo party yesterday.

37:04.219 --> 37:06.244
They didn't come back here
last night.

37:06.321 --> 37:08.084
<i>Herman said they were waiting
to see you.</i>

37:08.156 --> 37:10.647
<i>We figured you might have
asked them to stay over.</i>

37:10.725 --> 37:13.193
Magnum, where are they?

37:13.428 --> 37:15.828
They were carrying $39,000.

37:17.933 --> 37:19.730
Something must have happened
to them.

37:19.801 --> 37:21.598
<i>I"m calling the cops.</i>
No.

37:21.670 --> 37:24.537
Just give me a couple of hours, I
think I know where they might be.

37:24.606 --> 37:25.971
I'll call you
as soon as I find them.

37:26.041 --> 37:27.599
Magnum, there's something
you ought to see.

37:27.676 --> 37:29.405
What?
My old yearbook.

37:29.477 --> 37:32.844
Higgins, not now. This is
regarding the LaSalle sisters.

37:32.914 --> 37:36.372
I first saw them
37 years ago this July.

37:36.952 --> 37:38.613
And? Do you recall
that when the sisters...

37:38.687 --> 37:40.678
first came to tea,
I had the curious sensation...

37:40.755 --> 37:44.088
of having known them before? What's
your point, Higgins? I'm in a hurry.

37:44.159 --> 37:46.389
The LaSalle sisters
were performers.

37:46.461 --> 37:48.395
This is the theatre program
from Blackpool...

37:48.463 --> 37:51.023
the summer I completed
my upper second at Sandhurst.

37:51.099 --> 37:53.260
My father felt that some
sort of family celebration...

37:53.335 --> 37:55.326
of my accomplishment
was in order, although...

37:55.403 --> 37:57.166
of course, I never
admitted this to Father...

37:57.239 --> 37:59.833
Blackpool was a bit gaudy,
by my standards.

38:00.175 --> 38:01.802
They were quick change artists.

38:01.877 --> 38:05.074
Well, that's hardly the description
for a classic performance.

38:05.146 --> 38:07.910
They presented a unique
multi-charactered mime.

38:07.983 --> 38:11.680
Just the two of them. Quite
an extraordinary display of...

38:14.356 --> 38:18.690
Ollie, it isn't fair of you to ask
this of us. And not very bright.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.951
The cash registers
were one thing...

38:21.029 --> 38:25.466
but, $150,000
is a very serious crime.

38:25.533 --> 38:29.162
Girls, believe me, now this
is fair. And you owe me.

38:29.237 --> 38:32.001
Why do you think I didn't turn you
in after the first robbery, huh?

38:32.073 --> 38:34.735
All these other jobs, they were
just a warm-up for this one.

38:34.809 --> 38:37.903
Forget it.
Okay.

38:38.013 --> 38:39.674
You really wanna forget it, huh?

38:39.748 --> 38:42.410
That bingo money
belongs to Johnnie...

38:42.484 --> 38:46.386
and Herman and all the other
people at the Fountainbleu.

38:46.454 --> 38:50.151
And they'll get it back just
as soon as you pull this job.

38:50.725 --> 38:51.919
Ollie...

38:54.262 --> 38:56.492
there aren't going to be
any guns.

38:56.932 --> 39:00.060
Promise me.
I promise. No guns.

39:05.173 --> 39:07.505
<i>Footnote to the
dissertation on failure.</i>

39:07.575 --> 39:09.042
<i>My little voice
had convinced me...</i>

39:09.110 --> 39:13.171
<i>that all my failures of the last few
days had been carefully planned.</i>

39:13.248 --> 39:15.011
<i>It was also saying...</i>

39:15.083 --> 39:19.247
<i>"Thomas, despite what the LaSalle
sisters have led you to believe..."</i>

39:19.321 --> 39:23.280
<i>"you are a functioning adult,
and proving it is sometimes..."</i>

39:23.358 --> 39:24.916
<i>"very painful."</i>

39:24.993 --> 39:27.791
Please, go away.
I want to buy something.

39:32.534 --> 39:34.161
What time's the big pick up?

39:34.235 --> 39:35.702
What are you talking about?

39:36.538 --> 39:37.732
Miss Wilcox...

39:37.806 --> 39:41.207
I happen to know that Day-N-Dark
is too cheap to pay armed guards...

39:41.276 --> 39:43.335
overtime for holidays.
Too cheap?

39:43.411 --> 39:47.074
Which means that all the money from
all the stores is in one location.

39:47.816 --> 39:49.147
One guard.

39:49.651 --> 39:51.448
It's here, isn't it?

39:52.120 --> 39:54.782
They come for the money at
12:00, but I don't need any help.

39:54.856 --> 39:58.815
You have been replaced by a very
competent Day-N-Dark security guard.

39:58.893 --> 40:00.656
Where is he?
In the back.

40:00.729 --> 40:01.718
Fine.

40:01.796 --> 40:04.458
I'll need to see those reports
that I left behind on the robberies.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.432
You know, the photos, police
interviews, all of that.

40:06.501 --> 40:08.560
You did not leave
the reports, Magnum.

40:08.636 --> 40:11.833
You were asked to return them
after you were fired.

40:11.906 --> 40:16.570
Miss Wilcox, please. You have
over $150,000 in your office.

40:16.644 --> 40:18.009
If that money is stolen...

40:18.079 --> 40:20.445
I don't think your bosses are
gonna be too happy with you.

40:20.515 --> 40:23.609
So, can I please see
those police reports? No.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.253
Yes, may I help you?

40:33.294 --> 40:34.420
$1.98.

40:34.496 --> 40:37.488
All right, let's see,
that's $1.98 a pound.

40:38.033 --> 40:40.365
This is $3.49.

40:40.502 --> 40:41.696
$5.67.

40:47.842 --> 40:49.173
Thank you.

40:58.453 --> 41:00.387
You stole the reports.
Here.

41:00.455 --> 41:01.979
It didn't seem important
at the time...

41:02.057 --> 41:03.649
but it happened
at every one of the robberies.

41:03.725 --> 41:05.852
"10:05,
nun slipped on wet floor."

41:05.927 --> 41:08.395
"Cash register attendant
ran to her assistance."

41:08.463 --> 41:11.193
"10:09, attendant returned
to find register empty."

41:11.266 --> 41:12.961
"2:16, elderly man fainted."

41:13.034 --> 41:16.561
"Day-N-Dark attendant called paramedics,
returning to find cash register empty."

41:16.638 --> 41:19.232
All right, proving what?
Proving...

41:21.643 --> 41:25.135
Proving that none of us are infallible
when it comes to judging character.

42:25.874 --> 42:27.603
Oh, I knocked down...

42:27.675 --> 42:30.576
Oh. Oh, my knee.

42:33.114 --> 42:34.411
Nice move, Madge.

42:34.482 --> 42:37.940
Although, I thought the nun's
outfit was a nicer touch.

42:38.353 --> 42:41.049
Yeah, how's this
for a nice touch, huh?

42:41.456 --> 42:44.118
Ollie, you promised. No guns.
Hey, I lied.

42:46.794 --> 42:50.457
You dirty rat.
You promised no guns.

42:50.532 --> 42:53.228
How dare you bring a gun
in here? He's the one.

42:53.301 --> 42:56.930
You stinking raccoon! How
dare you bring a gun in here?

42:57.005 --> 42:58.495
You promised.

43:12.053 --> 43:13.543
I still don't see...

43:13.621 --> 43:15.589
why you had to call
the police right away.

43:15.657 --> 43:18.820
A crime has been committed,
or perhaps you didn't notice.

43:18.893 --> 43:21.157
Of course I noticed.
Well, if you don't mind...

43:21.229 --> 43:24.562
I would like to finish my
report before they get here.

43:24.632 --> 43:26.065
Ollie was the guard...

43:26.134 --> 43:30.400
at the very first Day-N-Dark
we tried to rob.

43:30.471 --> 43:33.634
Jeanie was a high school boy
getting a soft drink.

43:33.708 --> 43:36.677
I was a housewife
waiting to check out.

43:39.347 --> 43:43.340
Ollie was outside
waiting for us by our car.

43:43.985 --> 43:48.285
He said, "High School boys
don't wear cameo rings."

43:49.357 --> 43:52.292
It always worked best
when I played the men.

43:54.429 --> 43:59.025
After that first time, Oliver
actually hit the registers.

43:59.100 --> 44:01.898
Yes, but that doesn't change
the fact that you took the money.

44:01.970 --> 44:06.339
They'll give it back. Well,
I'm not so sure about that.

44:06.407 --> 44:10.343
It's all gone. Little
expenses, damage to the car.

44:10.411 --> 44:12.436
The color TV,
and Herman's piano...

44:12.513 --> 44:15.448
and the cable money,
and the stereo for Millie.

44:15.850 --> 44:18.318
You guys bought those things and
told the people at the hotel...

44:18.386 --> 44:20.445
it was from their relatives,
right?

44:20.521 --> 44:24.514
You forgot David's recliner
and Margaret's gall bladder...

44:24.826 --> 44:27.989
Duke's heart pacer, and
Ralph's cordless telephone.

44:28.062 --> 44:30.860
Oh, we made sure
everybody got something.

44:31.733 --> 44:33.291
I can understand the operations.

44:33.368 --> 44:36.166
But why didn't you pay your
rent, instead of buying toys?

44:36.237 --> 44:37.295
Toys?

44:37.372 --> 44:40.603
But they're just as important
as operations, the rent.

44:41.643 --> 44:45.374
Sometimes health and having a
place to live aren't important...

44:45.446 --> 44:47.346
unless you have a reason
to live.

44:47.649 --> 44:49.549
Take Johnnie Wells.

44:49.617 --> 44:53.383
How long do you think he'd survive
without his love for baseball?

44:54.055 --> 44:55.215
A television set...

44:55.290 --> 44:57.121
is just as important
to his life...

44:57.558 --> 45:00.459
as a new heart pacer
is to Duke's.

45:00.928 --> 45:02.452
And Herman...

45:02.897 --> 45:06.628
take away his piano, and
he'll turn into a vegetable.

45:07.669 --> 45:10.638
No way to communicate...

45:11.739 --> 45:13.138
nothing to live for.

45:15.977 --> 45:17.706
We're here for the suspects.

45:19.847 --> 45:22.714
Ladies, no matter how noble
your motive...

45:24.652 --> 45:26.244
it was still stealing.

45:26.487 --> 45:29.786
Miss Wilcox.
Heather, please...

45:30.825 --> 45:34.488
we've got the bingo money from
Oliver. They've got $40,000.

45:34.562 --> 45:38.020
They can pay back every cent
they've stolen and Oliver's share...

45:38.099 --> 45:41.296
and besides, they did assist
in stopping the big heist.

45:41.369 --> 45:43.234
No, dear, she's right.

45:43.371 --> 45:46.499
We committed a crime
and we must pay.

45:48.643 --> 45:51.203
I just wondered, if we could...

45:51.279 --> 45:54.840
just change our clothes
before they take us away.

46:01.723 --> 46:03.315
Oh...

46:03.391 --> 46:05.882
when the store gets back
its money...

46:06.627 --> 46:08.458
would you take the rest
to Johnnie?

46:08.596 --> 46:10.996
They can still make
a down payment on the hotel.

46:11.466 --> 46:13.127
You can give it to him
yourselves.

46:13.201 --> 46:15.669
Oh, I'm not so sure, Thomas.

46:16.337 --> 46:19.272
We're going to be away
for a long, long time.

46:19.674 --> 46:21.869
That's ridiculous, you're...

46:23.578 --> 46:26.376
You called me Thomas.
Naturally.

46:27.548 --> 46:29.948
Tommy's a little boy
with an all-day sucker.

46:30.618 --> 46:31.812
Thomas...

46:32.453 --> 46:35.479
is much more fitting
for a private investigator.

46:37.992 --> 46:39.516
We'll be right back.

47:18.332 --> 47:21.324
Oh, well, I hope you're happy.
They got away.

47:21.402 --> 47:24.303
Do you realize how many forms I'm
going to have to fill out for this?

47:24.372 --> 47:25.669
Why is it my fault?

47:25.740 --> 47:27.901
You're the one who said they
could change their clothes.

47:27.975 --> 47:32.275
Oh, sure, try to shift the
responsibility. How like you.

47:32.346 --> 47:33.335
Me?

47:33.681 --> 47:37.014
Me? You don't even know me.
