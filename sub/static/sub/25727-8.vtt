WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:04.170
I had trace amounts of pee on my pants

00:04.171 --> 00:07.131
for my entire set. I was frazzled.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.258
Industry nights just get
in your head, you know?

00:09.259 --> 00:12.220
But you know what? If we
stand here looking sad,

00:12.221 --> 00:14.931
none of these TV people
are gonna come talk to us.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.808
Trust me. I learned that from
many middle school dances.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.102
I don't know how to not
look sad when I stand.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.729
Why don't we go talk to that sad guy?

00:21.730 --> 00:23.375
- I like that he's sad,
- [ESTHER] Yeah.

00:23.386 --> 00:25.107
'cause I feel like we
might have an angle there.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.275
I mean, I did crowd work with him

00:26.276 --> 00:28.125
and I told him he looked
like a baby falcon.

00:28.136 --> 00:29.237
Which doesn't make any sense.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.821
- I was just nervous and saying stuff.
- No, no, no.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.617
You know what? That's the
perfect icebreaker. Let's go.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.979
Hi, I'm Esther, and this is Benji.

00:38.990 --> 00:41.109
[BENJI] I don't really think
you look like a baby falcon.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.376
I was kinda nervous and I lashed out.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.586
It's all right, man. I get it.
I saw both your sets.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.046
You guys were pretty funny, actually.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.048
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.841
I'm Tom Piner.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.261
I'm the executive producer
of the American Dog Awards.

00:53.262 --> 00:56.013
Shut up! I love the American Dog Awards.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.266
It is a funny award show.
I caught it the year

00:58.267 --> 01:00.851
Triumph roasted the dog
from Modern Family.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.145
The look on her face.
She did not see it coming.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.857
Listen, I actually have a couple
openings on my writing staff.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.526
You interested?

01:08.527 --> 01:11.112
- What? Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.738
- Are you guys all right?
- [BOTH] Yeah.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.323
Have you guys had jobs before?

01:14.324 --> 01:15.700
- Eem.
- S... Too many.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.285
- How do you mean?
- Like a bunch.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.962
- OK.
- [ESTHER] I mean, I've never spent

01:18.973 --> 01:21.892
more than three hours at one place
for more than a day in a row, but...

01:21.903 --> 01:23.499
[BENJI] I get tons of job offers.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.085
For me it's really just the art
of saying no, at this point.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.431
But this is something I wanna do.

01:27.442 --> 01:29.088
The pay's not great. Just so you know.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.407
Do I have to join a union?
My grandfather's a Republican,

01:31.418 --> 01:33.228
and I promised I never would join one.

01:33.239 --> 01:36.053
Oh, no. It's very non-union.
Don't worry about that.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.430
Let me give you one of my cards.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.890
Somebody just text me,
and we'll figure it out.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.726
- [BENJI] Cool.
- Nice meeting you guys.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.020
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.940
Did that just happen?

01:48.984 --> 01:51.527
Aah! Are you crying? I'm crying.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.155
I... I don't even know.
I'm combusting internally.

01:54.156 --> 01:57.241
I... I don't even know if I can cry.
I don't know what I'm feeling.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.160
[EXHALES SHARPLY] Let me see.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.412
- Oh, my God.
- We made it.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.291
I don't know what else
to say, but we made it.

02:03.302 --> 02:05.888
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:08.627 --> 02:10.003
Oh, crap!

02:10.005 --> 02:11.964
Benji, I just remembered
there's a grape Nerd

02:11.965 --> 02:13.341
stuck under my "L" key,

02:13.342 --> 02:15.134
so I can't type anything with an "L".

02:15.135 --> 02:16.844
You know what? I'm gonna need you

02:16.845 --> 02:18.929
to e-mail me some "L" s
so I can copy, paste them.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.557
Just do capital, lowercase, bold,

02:21.558 --> 02:22.808
italic, and I'll be covered.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.977
Or just a joke binder like me.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.354
A binder? No.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.022
I'm living in the digital age.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.982
I'll be using my laptop computer.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.985
Just take a look at what I'm doing here.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.573
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Bone"?

02:37.574 --> 02:41.202
"Hair-y Paw-ter

02:41.203 --> 02:42.662
and the Sorcerer's Bone."

02:42.663 --> 02:45.378
That's six words, three plays on words.

02:45.389 --> 02:47.166
Even if you're not laughing,
you're thinking.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.126
I'm not laughing.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.170
But I'm thinking. So, yeah.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.297
Oh, really? What are you
doing that's so great?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.758
[SIGHS] Benji, I'm
a girl who loves dogs.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.176
They're my first friends,

02:57.177 --> 03:00.805
my first love, even my first kiss.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.640
No one in this world
loves dogs more than me.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.016
And that's why this year,

03:04.017 --> 03:06.876
I'm bringing the heart
to the Dog Awards.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.281
For real though, how stoked are you?

03:08.292 --> 03:10.064
- So stoked.
- There's definitely gonna be

03:10.065 --> 03:11.732
an espresso machine in that office.

03:11.733 --> 03:15.027
Do you think we'll also have a view of
the Hollywood sign from our office?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.113
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God!

03:17.114 --> 03:19.198
[TOM] Sorry you guys
gotta share an office,

03:19.199 --> 03:22.076
but, um, and make sure
that vent stays open

03:22.077 --> 03:24.120
at all times, and also, that

03:24.121 --> 03:26.747
carbon monoxide detector
has to be plugged in.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.208
Wow, so do we have free
use of all these mops?

03:29.209 --> 03:32.086
I guess. For what?

03:32.087 --> 03:34.171
This is amazing, but whose
leg do I have to hump

03:34.172 --> 03:35.965
to get a coffee around here?

03:35.966 --> 03:38.634
You're not on the clock yet,
but that's the spirit.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.885
Good to have you guys on board.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.262
I gotta take this. This is my wife.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.513
Ex-wife. I don't know.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.390
We're getting divorced. It sucks.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.434
Love isn't real. Don't ever get married.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.060
Um, help yourselves to any breakfast

03:48.061 --> 03:49.312
that's on set. I gotta go.

03:52.441 --> 03:55.234
Wow. I can't believe this is free.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.486
This is a better
breakfast spread than that

03:57.487 --> 04:00.197
pharmaceutical office on
Wilshire we used to break into.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.782
I know. This is crazy.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.909
There's donut variety, cinnamon rolls.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.952
Apple Jacks.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.538
- Dude, no onion bagels.
- [SCOFFS]

04:07.539 --> 04:09.415
The less people watch TV,
the worse the spread gets.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.541
You know, on "The Critic,"

04:10.542 --> 04:11.971
the writers had an omelet bar.

04:11.982 --> 04:13.294
- [BECKY] Of course.
- Yeah. It's gonna be

04:13.295 --> 04:15.440
- the longest week of my life.
- Hey, I'm Benji.

04:15.451 --> 04:16.786
I'm a new writer on the show.

04:16.797 --> 04:18.757
Did I just hear you say
you wrote on "The Critic"?

04:18.757 --> 04:20.301
Yeah, like 25 years ago.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.887
Dude, that's my favorite show ever!

04:22.888 --> 04:25.205
What, are you one of these young
guys they hire for his Tweets?

04:25.216 --> 04:28.934
No, but I got Tweets. Are you trying
to jam on some stuff? No? OK.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.188
- I'll see you in the room, dude!
- Wow, wearing dog paraphernalia.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.522
It's a little on the nose.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.733
You think?

04:34.744 --> 04:36.275
That's exactly where I was aiming.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.610
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.102
You're not even doing a bit.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.583
I can't believe I've been doing
this for eight years in a row.

04:41.594 --> 04:44.158
Eight years? That's double college.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.035
[WHISPERS] What's your secret?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.204
Opiates and Metamucil.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.581
Are those your dogs' names?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.541
[TOM] Um, OK, let's dive into pitches.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.335
Remember, this is the Dog Awards,

04:54.336 --> 04:56.086
so puns are welcome.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.256
OK, so, um, we have
a dog on a surfboard.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.217
- Uh, wearing sunglasses.
- [BECKY] Right.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.260
And then he barks the lyrics

05:03.261 --> 05:04.678
to a Beach Boys song.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.807
BIG LETTERS: "Dogs Just Wanna Have Sun."

05:07.808 --> 05:09.600
- [LAUGHING]
- [TOM] OK, all right.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.478
- [TOM] Is that even a Beach Boys song?
- Uh, who else?

05:12.479 --> 05:14.355
Uh, yeah, maybe, uh,

05:14.356 --> 05:16.982
there's a sketch where
there's a hot dog vendor,

05:16.983 --> 05:19.985
and then he's like, "Hot dogs! Get
your hot dogs!" And then all these

05:19.986 --> 05:22.112
wiener dogs come out in bikinis.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.866
And if we want, maybe it could be funny
'cause dogs have a lot of nipples.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.078
Maybe the bikinis could look funny.
I don't know.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.581
- Damn, that's solid, man.
- Hot dogs!

05:32.582 --> 05:34.959
- Yeah, sexy hot dogs.
- I get it. Yeah, yeah.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.752
- That could be funny.
- Good one.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.962
- I like it.
- [PHONE DINGING]

05:37.963 --> 05:39.006
Oh, shoot. Sorry.

05:39.017 --> 05:41.423
Uh, I have a segment pitch

05:41.424 --> 05:43.843
for Hero Dog of the Year Award.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.345
I was thinking we could
show heartwarming videos

05:46.346 --> 05:48.324
introducing all of the nominees.

05:48.335 --> 05:50.387
You know how like when you're
watching the Olympics,

05:50.398 --> 05:52.017
and you learn that an ice skater's mom

05:52.018 --> 05:53.269
just died in an avalanche,

05:53.270 --> 05:54.937
and then you really want her to win?

05:54.938 --> 05:57.023
Sorta like that.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.817
I don't... where's the...

05:59.818 --> 06:01.151
I don't... where's the punchline?

06:01.152 --> 06:03.904
Well, there wouldn't
be a punchline there,

06:03.905 --> 06:07.074
but if we add those kind
of heartwarming moments,

06:07.075 --> 06:09.702
then the other jokes will land harder.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.246
So, think about that.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.081
I mean, that's very nice, Esther,

06:14.082 --> 06:15.666
but I'm not sure it fits in the tone

06:15.667 --> 06:17.418
of the Dog Awards.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.711
Think of, like, I don't know,

06:18.712 --> 06:20.296
jokes that would be on a bumper sticker.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.507
Or on a t-shirt at a seaside gift shop.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.134
And you're shopping and you're like,

06:25.135 --> 06:27.052
"Oh, my God! That's hilarious!"

06:27.053 --> 06:28.935
It's short and sweet,
and maybe you're high,

06:28.946 --> 06:30.764
so it's super funny.
Like that kind of stuff.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.434
- Like "pug life."
- That's my guy right there!

06:33.435 --> 06:35.060
Pug life. See what we're doing now?

06:35.061 --> 06:36.061
Oh, oh. OK.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.688
I got a pitch.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.440
Two dogs are fighting over a stick.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.067
One dog's supposed to get the
stick every other weekend,

06:42.068 --> 06:43.569
but Friday comes, and the other dog

06:43.570 --> 06:44.667
won't give him the stick.

06:44.678 --> 06:47.239
One day you're in your beautiful
house with the dog you love,

06:47.240 --> 06:48.574
three beautiful little sticks.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.576
Next day trying to figure out

06:50.577 --> 06:52.369
how Tinder works on your phone

06:52.370 --> 06:54.955
that can't even get the
update to work properly.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.333
[SHARPLY EXHALES]

06:57.334 --> 06:59.335
You know what? Let's take a break.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.711
We're gonna take a quick break.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.547
We'll come back. It's fine.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.341
Maybe someone should follow him.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.760
He... He seems really upset.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.595
You'll learn quickly that

07:09.596 --> 07:11.305
the more stuff Tom is going through,

07:11.306 --> 07:12.829
the more breaks we get.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.808
- Need a drink?
- Oh, yeah, let's get a drink.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.769
- You guys want?
- It's 10:00 am.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.146
Oh. [CHUCKLES]

07:22.942 --> 07:24.860
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.154
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.990
I know how hard divorce can be.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.975
When I was in fourth grade,
me and my best friend,

07:31.986 --> 07:34.495
Christina, broke up for a year,
and we had to split our whole

07:34.506 --> 07:36.997
lip smackers caboodle,
and it... it got ugly.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.165
Thank you, Esther.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.958
I just want someone to talk to.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.211
Like, I tried opening up to my lawyer,

07:42.212 --> 07:44.922
and then I found out he was
charging me $800 an hour.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.006
That's awful.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.216
And I just want you to know,

07:47.217 --> 07:48.926
now that I'm working here,

07:48.927 --> 07:50.719
I'm always around, and if you ever

07:50.720 --> 07:53.639
wanna talk, my price is free.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.641
Wait, Esther. Actually, maybe

07:55.642 --> 07:57.935
we should do that segment that
you were pitching earlier.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.812
I'm starting to feel like we're doing

07:59.813 --> 08:02.815
all these dog jokes,
and what we should be doing

08:02.816 --> 08:04.942
is, like, actually
processing our emotions.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.318
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.403
Why don't you write it up,

08:07.404 --> 08:08.654
and you should produce it.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.531
You want me to be a producer?

08:10.532 --> 08:11.865
It's important you understand

08:11.866 --> 08:13.075
your title won't change.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.284
You'd still be a writer.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.286
You're just producing one segment.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.622
I can't wait till the ladies
at Chipotle hear about this,

08:18.623 --> 08:20.999
because extra guac
will not be a problem.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.085
Thank you so much, sir. At ease.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.671
Oh, dismissed.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.006
Benji! Benji, Benji, Benji.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.134
He's letting me produce
my dog hero segment

08:30.135 --> 08:32.010
and I don't even know
what producing means.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.408
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey!

08:33.419 --> 08:36.232
Quick question. On the hot dog sketch,
do you imagine the dogs wearing

08:36.244 --> 08:37.808
four high heels, or just two?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.518
Oh, you know what? I've
got this in my binder.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.811
It's all storyboarded.
Let me just grab it.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.102
- Oh, yeah, grab it.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:42.113 --> 08:43.605
Yeah, it's all storyboarded.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.898
We're just producing.

08:44.899 --> 08:45.983
All right.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.109
Oy!

08:47.110 --> 08:49.737
My binder. Where is it?

08:49.738 --> 08:51.030
I left it right here.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.157
Did you hide it?

08:53.158 --> 08:55.034
Benji, I don't touch outdated media.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.119
We've talked about this.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.955
My jokes are gone.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.166
Esther, close the vent and let me die.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.586
Does this mean that
I'm getting my own office?

09:05.843 --> 09:07.726
[TOM] Any movie pitches? We need...

09:07.737 --> 09:09.339
- Jurassic Bark.
- Classic one.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.134
Great, and, uh, Game of Barks.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.552
It's a lot of barks, that's fine.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.804
Uh, Benji, you have anything for that?

09:15.805 --> 09:18.182
Um...

09:18.183 --> 09:19.975
I mean, both of those
are really good ideas.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.227
I just... yeah, those were great.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.605
Great, thanks. Helpful.

09:24.606 --> 09:28.108
OK, then we have the sponsored
sketch for Starbucks.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.985
We might be calling it "Barkbucks".

09:29.986 --> 09:31.737
Does anyone have any pitches for that?

09:31.738 --> 09:32.988
Benji?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.908
Um, I had this thing in my binder

09:35.909 --> 09:37.493
where it was like bones.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.161
Like bones coffee.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.121
Not bones coffee, but...

09:41.122 --> 09:43.040
Bro, just riff.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.752
What about, uh, a riff of, uh, oh!

09:46.753 --> 09:48.170
You guys remember <i>"Yo quiero"</i> ?

09:48.171 --> 09:50.464
Yeah, that was a Chihuahua
from a Taco Bell ad.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.924
What does that have to do with coffee?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.509
I don't know.
That was a funny commercial.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.719
- You gotta admit that.
- That's not even an idea.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.763
That's just a reference
to something that existed.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.932
What about <i>"Yo quiero Frappuccino"?</i>

09:59.933 --> 10:01.683
- [TOM'S PHONE DINGS]
- You feeling all right, dude?

10:01.684 --> 10:03.435
All right, my ex just texted me

10:03.436 --> 10:05.979
she wants to throw away
all of my old yearbooks.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.273
So, let's just take five.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.067
Mm.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.110
Yap-accino!

10:11.111 --> 10:13.153
Geez!

10:13.154 --> 10:14.780
I just... I was trying to think of it,

10:14.781 --> 10:16.323
and then I did.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.742
Take a break.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.954
I took the liberty of researching
each of the nominees.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.413
And first we have Chi Chi.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.749
She has all four of her legs amputated,

10:25.750 --> 10:27.960
but that does not stop her

10:27.961 --> 10:29.920
because she's got four prosthetic paws,

10:29.921 --> 10:31.338
and she's happier than ever.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.589
I always thought Tom hated me,

10:32.590 --> 10:33.757
but this confirms it.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.259
OK. Well,

10:35.260 --> 10:37.136
next up we have Daisy.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.720
The hero police dog.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.890
Butter... epileptic Pomeranian.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.100
And then there's Fuzz...

10:43.101 --> 10:45.018
Wilmer Valderrama's dog.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.938
And he's got nothing going for him.

10:47.939 --> 10:48.939
Wilmer or his dog?

10:48.940 --> 10:51.483
There's no adversity to his story.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.569
Every photo of him, he's with a model

10:53.570 --> 10:54.903
or he's on the red carpet.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.196
You know what?

10:56.197 --> 10:59.116
You are so passionate
about this project.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.993
Why don't you just
take it and run with it?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.369
- OK.
- Just go!

11:02.370 --> 11:03.662
And then you'll look at it later

11:03.663 --> 11:05.080
and tell me it's good?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.166
And if you don't hear anything,

11:07.167 --> 11:10.085
you can assume I loved it.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.128
That is cool.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.338
I love being a producer.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.008
You need to stop saying "producer."
That's not your title.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.156
I understand.

11:17.167 --> 11:18.760
[ESTHER] OK, I'm sorry,

11:18.761 --> 11:20.637
but there is no way for me to make

11:20.638 --> 11:22.639
Fuzz Valderrama inspiring.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.057
He doesn't know struggle.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.225
He doesn't know what it's like

11:25.226 --> 11:27.519
to scrounge for food or pay bills,

11:27.520 --> 11:29.271
or have a studio apartment.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.834
I knew this would happen.

11:30.845 --> 11:32.264
You're trying to win a Dog Award.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.694
I'm not, but I do think I
deserve one more than Fuzz.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.652
I don't have time to argue with you
about Fuzz. I'm trying to write

11:37.663 --> 11:39.656
three weeks worth of jokes in a night.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.450
You got this, OK?

11:41.451 --> 11:44.578
What about "Hairy Pawter
and the Sorcerer's Bone"?

11:44.579 --> 11:46.205
That was a special idea.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.915
You're right! That was a good idea!

11:47.916 --> 11:49.416
I totally forgot about that one!

11:49.417 --> 11:52.377
- Yeah.
- That bit's a slam dunk, man!

11:52.378 --> 11:54.546
I'm gonna be, like,
Steph Curry there tomorrow,

11:54.557 --> 11:56.965
just sinkin' threes. It's gonna crush!

11:56.966 --> 12:00.010
- Is that sports stuff?
- It was. It felt weird.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.054
Let's hear some pitches.
We still need something

12:02.055 --> 12:03.838
- for the opening number, so...
- Yeah.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.641
- Yeah I was thinking we...
- All right, I got one.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.643
- [LAUGHS]
- Sorry about that. You go first.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.478
Uh... No, no. You go ahead. It's fine.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.687
Anyone. Just pitch something.

12:10.688 --> 12:14.483
Here's a little idea I had.
How about... "Hairy Pawter"

12:14.484 --> 12:16.318
and the Sorcerer's Bone"?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.111
- [TOM] Yes! Yes.
- [BECKY LAUGHS]

12:18.112 --> 12:19.696
Dumb, but in a good way.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.781
- I think this is Dog Award Stuff.
- [BECKY] Right.

12:20.782 --> 12:21.990
[JIM] Like "good dog," right?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.575
Who can we get to play Harry Potter?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.244
I'm thinking of that dog
from the Super Bowl commercial.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.454
- You know who I'm talking about.
- Cosmo!

12:27.455 --> 12:29.164
- Yeah.
- I heard, on the set of "Snow Dogs 2,"

12:29.165 --> 12:33.001
that he was constantly aroused
from all the fake fur

12:33.002 --> 12:34.878
from the boots and the parkas
and stuff like that.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.256
Totally cool, now, no, no.
He went to obedience school,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.049
so he's all good now.
He's ready to work.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.134
- Let's just start calling out ideas.
- [JIM] Done!

12:41.135 --> 12:42.219
Um, I think this is good.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.887
- All right.
- Let me guess.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.098
So, in this idea that <i>you</i> came up with,

12:46.099 --> 12:49.607
Hermione is a Cocker Spaniel,
Voldemort a hairless cat?

12:49.618 --> 12:52.104
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. All that.
- You guys are in sync, you two.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.355
Yeah, I guess so, right?

12:53.356 --> 12:54.690
[TOM] Has anyone read the books

12:54.691 --> 12:57.150
or seen the movies? I have not.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.777
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER] <i>Chi Chi might've lost</i>

12:58.778 --> 13:00.290
<i>- all four of her legs,</i>
- [DOG WHIMPERING]

13:00.301 --> 13:04.574
<i>but she hasn't lost her
ability to make people smile.</i>

13:04.575 --> 13:07.536
- [TOY SQUEAKS]
- [TOM] That was fantastic.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.789
I mean, Esther, people are gonna
fall in love with Chi Chi

13:10.790 --> 13:13.584
when they see this. I just feel
terrible now that she's not gonna win.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.088
Oh, well, you guys saw my video.

13:18.089 --> 13:21.133
I think it's safe to say
Chi Chi's gonna win.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.926
She's got <i>no legs.</i>

13:22.927 --> 13:26.221
No, Esther, Wilmer Valderrama's
dog is gonna win, Fuzz.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.308
This is the only way we could get
Wilmer to walk the red carpet,

13:29.309 --> 13:32.102
and Wilmer Valderrama
brings the ratings.

13:32.103 --> 13:35.856
Ratings?! What would
our advertisers think

13:35.857 --> 13:37.566
if they knew you were just
chasing ratings?

13:37.567 --> 13:40.110
Every award show I've written
for has been rigged.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.362
It's just the way it is.

13:46.993 --> 13:51.205
I knew about the Oscars. But
the American Dog Awards? Why?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.377
I can't believe Jim stole my binder.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.005
I know what it's like
to be let down by your heroes.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.049
One time, I sat next
to Bette Midler on a plane,

14:02.050 --> 14:04.051
and she was wearing flip flops.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.011
- She flies coach?
- Yeah.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.057
This way, gentlemen. Coming through!
Coming through!

14:11.017 --> 14:13.435
[ESTHER] Who is that
strong, empowered woman?

14:13.436 --> 14:17.022
I am getting major
Ruth Bader Ginsburg vibes.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.440
Oh, that's Gertel, our calligrapher.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.484
She does the winning cards
for all the awards shows.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.904
They say she can make cursive
with her feet. Ugh.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.239
She must have a strong
anti-kidnapping clause.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.896
She had two bodyguards.

14:27.914 --> 14:29.858
No, she's carrying
a list of winners with her.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.538
They have to be really careful,
especially after the Oscars screw-up.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.625
- Mm.
- Oscars screw-up?

14:36.918 --> 14:39.211
Oh, my God, Benji. That's it.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.530
I am gonna switch the cards and
"La La Land" the Dog Awards.

14:42.541 --> 14:44.253
Or would you call that
"Moonlight" -ing it?

14:44.264 --> 14:47.010
I don't know. I'm gonna "La La Land"
the Dog Awards and make Chi Chi win.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.970
Esther, you can't.
What about the sanctity

14:48.971 --> 14:51.473
of the awar... I'm kidding.
Screw this place.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.433
He gets it.

14:53.434 --> 14:57.104
Hey, Gertel. I'm Esther,
one of the producers here.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.647
Nice to meet you.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.483
So, we're, uh, shuffling
some stuff around, last min.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.610
TV, you know how it is, no big deal.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.196
What we're gonna wanna do
is lose the "Fuzz" winner card

15:06.197 --> 15:08.157
and swap it out
for a "Chi Chi" winner card.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.828
You think Gertel was born yesterday?

15:13.121 --> 15:16.498
I've been doing this for 60 years.

15:16.499 --> 15:21.086
Desi Arnaz tried to pull this
same crap with me in 1964.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.548
I'm sorry that Desi
played you like that.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.591
I don't know what you're trying to pull,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.593
but it's not going to fly.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.680
Ricardo, Tony.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.306
Get her outta here.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.934
I'll see myself out.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.103
Unless you guys wanted
to pick me up horizontally

15:38.104 --> 15:40.690
like Madonna
in the "Material Girl" video?

15:44.152 --> 15:45.986
And you reinforce this,
it'd be a good idea.

15:45.987 --> 15:49.406
So then Cosmo sits here, and then
that's just the broom, and it flies.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.974
- [TECHNICIAN] Mm-hmm.
- [JIM] Oh, great.

15:50.985 --> 15:52.576
Great. Oh, hey, excuse me.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.995
Those fuzzy slippers,
we cannot have those around

15:54.996 --> 15:57.706
when Cosmo shows up.
He will become aroused.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.958
Um, I wanted to talk
to you guys about something.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.003
I feel like the dogs in my hot dog
sketch aren't reading as hot.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.422
Uh, we cut that sketch, man. I'm sorry.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.008
- Oh, you cut it?
- It's not a funny thing,

16:08.009 --> 16:11.595
it's a time issue. It is also a
funny thing, if I'm being honest,

16:11.596 --> 16:14.431
but look, man, we're gonna
extend the Hairy Pawter bit.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.934
We need time to hold for laughs.
That sketch has legs.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.062
- Four legs, you might say.
- Ah, four legs! [LAUGHS]

16:21.063 --> 16:22.918
- Yeah. Four legs. That's good.
- [JIM SIGHS]

16:22.929 --> 16:24.806

16:38.247 --> 16:40.373
<i>It's the 21st annual
American Dog Awards!</i>

16:40.374 --> 16:42.542
Hey, buddy. Remember this?

16:42.543 --> 16:44.961
- [MAN] Ready camera one.
- Yeah. Of course I remember it.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.755
It's my binder that you stole.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.965
And don't try to feed me some lie

16:48.966 --> 16:51.014
about how you found it
in the bathroom or something,

16:51.025 --> 16:53.303
'cause I never use the bathrooms here.
They're disgusting.

16:53.314 --> 16:55.013
All right, dude. Settle down.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.016
Oh, I'm pretty settled
right now, but any minute,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.852
- Cosmo's gonna be really excited.
- What are you talkin' about?

17:00.853 --> 17:03.438
I put a fuzzy slipper
in Cosmo's Hairy Pawter box,

17:03.439 --> 17:07.275
so he's probably gonna boner
pretty hard on TV.

17:07.276 --> 17:11.445
- No, you didn't.
- You stole my binder. I was jokeless.

17:11.446 --> 17:15.116
Bro, I stole your binder,
'cause that's how it works.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.160
Older writers steal
from younger writers.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.994
I saw something in you.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.665
I was gonna take you with me
to the Guy's Choice Awards.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.085
I did... I didn't realize all that!

17:25.086 --> 17:26.252
- How?
- [ANNOUNCER] <i>Now let's take</i>

17:26.253 --> 17:29.130
<i>a magical trip to Dogwarts!</i>

17:29.131 --> 17:31.007
Oh, we got a lot of production
value goin' on here.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.511
What do we got, we got the
three capes and a hat.

17:34.512 --> 17:38.515
<i>And the one and only Hairy Pawter!</i>

17:38.516 --> 17:42.185
Oh, dang! That is
a big ol' dog lipstick!

17:42.186 --> 17:44.112
[JIM] I hope you're happy.
You're gonna get me fired.

17:44.123 --> 17:46.147
Of course I'm not happy!

17:46.148 --> 17:48.692
Guys, guys, listen.
That was the network.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.778
- Tom, I am so sorry...
- [TOM] No, no, no. Listen.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.656
They're loving this.
They say it's exactly

17:54.657 --> 17:57.784
the youthful rebrand
that the Dog Awards needs.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.412
I don't know. They think it's edgy.
Jim, you're a legend.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.039
- [BECKY] Jimbo! Whoo-hoo!
- All right. All right. OK.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.584
Well, there you go!
We're a comedy duo now.

18:05.585 --> 18:09.004
No, we're not. Good writers
borrow, great writers steal.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.923
Only hacks try to ruin
other writers' sketches.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.134
- Hack.
- Well...

18:14.135 --> 18:17.564
Maybe we could... still collab?

18:17.575 --> 18:18.753
Punch up each others' tweets?

18:18.764 --> 18:19.973
- [FANFARE]
- [APPLAUSE]

18:19.974 --> 18:22.267
<i>Hello. I'm Jonas Templeton,</i>

18:22.268 --> 18:25.103
<i>President of the American Canine Society</i>

18:25.104 --> 18:27.022
So I think I might be blacklisted

18:27.023 --> 18:30.108
from writing on awards shows,
but at least my sketch crushed.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.610
Who wants to write for these, anyway?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.738
It's a corrupt cesspool of lies.

18:34.739 --> 18:39.034
I heard Becky say
she has a cat. Traitor.

18:39.035 --> 18:42.037
<i>Here are the nominees

18:42.038 --> 18:44.039

<i>Chi Chi, the quadruple amputee

<i>And Fuzz Valderrama,</i>

18:50.921 --> 18:53.632
<i>who seems pretty cool on Instagram.</i>

18:53.633 --> 18:56.176

- <i>Stop! Stop!</i>
- [AUDIENCE GASPS]

18:58.220 --> 19:00.180
<i>I can't let this happen.</i>

19:00.181 --> 19:03.224
<i>I need the viewers at home
to know that this is rigged!</i>

19:03.225 --> 19:07.020
<i>That's right. And the real winner
tonight should be Chi Chi.</i>

19:07.021 --> 19:11.983
<i>She has four prosthetic paws
and one giant heart.</i>

19:11.984 --> 19:13.401
<i>Yeah, the card says, "Chi Chi."</i>

19:13.402 --> 19:14.403
- [APPLAUSE]
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

19:17.198 --> 19:19.241
<i>I mean... Oh.</i>

19:22.161 --> 19:26.831
<i>OK. Sorry. Uh, as you were,
Mr. Templeton.</i>

19:26.832 --> 19:29.000
<i>And, just so everyone at home knows,</i>

19:29.001 --> 19:32.170

[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING]

19:45.810 --> 19:50.397
[ESTHER] Well, safe to say that the
drama I created was good for ratings.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.970
Pretty sure if the ratings are good,

19:51.981 --> 19:53.858
it's gonna be because of my dog boner.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.528
[SIGHS] I can't believe they
only gave us one drink ticket.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.677
I know you switched the cards.
You act so cool,

19:58.688 --> 20:00.323
like you don't care,
but I know you care,

20:00.324 --> 20:02.200
and that you switched them! Thank you!

20:02.201 --> 20:03.660
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.291
That does not sound like
something I would do.

20:05.302 --> 20:07.038
Hey, did you guys hear about this?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.124
Somebody drugged Gertel.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.376
Now that sounds like
something I would do.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.378
'Scuse me!

20:13.921 --> 20:15.255
Well, guys, you did a job.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.632
The last guy quit halfway through, so...

20:17.633 --> 20:18.717
you did better than him.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.802
That sounds... We did a good job!

20:20.803 --> 20:22.095
Yeah. You did a job.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.221
I'll take it. Thanks, dude.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.223
Yeah. You're welcome.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.016
OK, bring it in.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.643
What'd you steal?

20:28.644 --> 20:30.186
I got these sunglasses.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.439
They were on a pug,
and they're really nice.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.524
And they fit!

20:35.109 --> 20:37.152
Lifetime supply of Post-Its.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.820
It's too bad you're not as smart as me,

20:38.821 --> 20:41.114
'cause I got eight staplers
in my messenger bag right now.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.700
There's a fax machine
and a label maker in your car.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.744
Don't open the trunk until we get home.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.748
Write that down.
Don't want you to forget.
