WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.127
Okay, so we hard cut
inside the convenience store.

00:02.211 --> 00:03.962
Cody and Barbara enter;
they're high as fuck.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.589
And they head to the snack aisle.

00:05.672 --> 00:06.840
- Yeah, and then that's probably

00:06.924 --> 00:08.091
where we should introduce Sheila, right?

00:08.175 --> 00:10.344
- Who's Sheila?
- You know, the crack whore.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.137
- Oh, the crack sex worker. Yeah.
- I mean, the crack sex worker.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.389
- Are we calling her Sheila?
- Yeah, why? Do you not like it?

00:14.473 --> 00:15.891
- I don't know.
She just doesn't, like,

00:15.974 --> 00:17.976
feel like a Sheila. Maybe Shayna?

00:18.060 --> 00:20.562
- Um, I actually do have
a cousin named Shayna,

00:20.646 --> 00:22.314
and I kind of worry that
she might be, like, offended.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.565
Do you know what I mean?

00:23.649 --> 00:24.942
Like, I don't want her to think
I'm making fun of her.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.027
And, see, the thing that
you have to know about Shayna--

00:27.110 --> 00:28.820
actually really nice to talk...
- Okay, but it's not like
she's gonna see it.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.822
I mean, it's just a spec script.
It's not like it's getting made.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.533
- Okay, well, it won't with that attitude,

00:32.616 --> 00:33.992
that's for sure.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.119
Oh, my God, Cody, if it's Dan,
do not pick up.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.121
Do not pick up!
We're working! Ugh!

00:38.205 --> 00:39.915
You fat bitch.
You always do this.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.834
Ugh, you're gonna come back,
and you're gonna be

00:41.917 --> 00:43.418
in a bad mood, and then we're gonna

00:43.502 --> 00:44.628
have to talk about your relationship,

00:44.711 --> 00:46.797
and I'm gonna have to pretend that I care.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.969
- Well, that's it.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.971
Dan's totally cheating on me. So...

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
- I know, right?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.808
- Yeah. He's going on
that girl Simone's podcast.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.060
And she is so beautiful.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.854
- She's honestly stunning.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.814
- They probably haven't gotten
physical yet, just because,

01:03.897 --> 01:05.941
like, she seems like
this really sweet person.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.693
And she's probably, like...
- Super sweet.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.570
- ...considering my feelings,
but it's only a matter of time,

01:09.653 --> 01:11.405
realistically, before, like,
they move in together

01:11.488 --> 01:12.948
and, you know, like,
start making a family.
- Yeah, time.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.116
Realistic. Time.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.909
- I mean, you know, he's a successful guy.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.120
Like, a lot of girls would...
- Uh-huh.

01:34.094 --> 01:38.432
Who... is...

01:38.515 --> 01:40.309
that?

01:40.392 --> 01:44.146
- Um, I don't know,
my downstairs neighbor?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.856
- Holy shit!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.816
I mean, you saw it, right?

01:47.900 --> 01:50.152
- See what?
- His dick.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.778
It was, like, bulging in his pants.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.281
- Oh, my God.
- It was, like, pulsating.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.824
And honestly, now that
I'm thinking about it,

01:55.908 --> 01:58.285
I think I could see the outline
of his balls, too.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.204
- Oh, my God. Dude. Dude. Gross!
- What?

02:00.287 --> 02:02.080
- He's, like, 14.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.208
- Okay, so?

02:04.291 --> 02:06.835
I'm seven.
He's, like, twice my age.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.505
- I mean, I guess, but still...

02:09.588 --> 02:11.465
- Okay, Cody, shut up.
You like older guys, too.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.799
Who do you think that was with him?

02:12.883 --> 02:13.967
Do you think that was his girlfriend?

02:14.051 --> 02:15.385
She's busted, right?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.513
I mean, could you believe what
she was wearing? It was like...

02:17.596 --> 02:19.306
- Dude, what? No.
That's his mom,

02:19.389 --> 02:22.226
who he lives with, 'cause he's 14.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.685
- Do you think it'd be, like, really weird

02:23.769 --> 02:24.978
if you set us up or whatever?

02:25.062 --> 02:27.773
- Yes. It would be insanely weird.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.650
Like, what's wrong with you?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.735
- I'm a sex doll, okay?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.487
I'm sorry that, like, my very nature

02:33.570 --> 02:34.947
is just completely offensive to you.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.907
- Okay, that's obviously not what I meant.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.659
- Forget I even ever brought it up.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.244
It's like, I'm always there for you.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.703
You're literally never there for me.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.622
- Wow. A hard right.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.916
When have I not been there for you?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.918
- Um, how about, like, ten minutes ago?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.586
The whole thing with my cousin Shayna.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.672
The second I start opening up
to you about something,

02:51.755 --> 02:53.298
you just shut me down.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.134
And things are really strained
with me and Shayna right now.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.386
No, and, like...
- Okay, Barbara, you can't just like...

02:57.469 --> 02:58.762
- Oh, my God, you're doing it again!

02:58.846 --> 03:00.180
- Barbara, this is insane.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.391
And I know that you have,
like, some weird hold over me,

03:02.474 --> 03:03.809
where I do all this
inappropriate shit for you,

03:03.892 --> 03:06.812
but I am not asking
my 14-year-old neighbor

03:06.895 --> 03:09.314
to fuck my boyfriend's used sex doll.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.902
So, um, just in here.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.406
Thanks a lot for helping me out
with this, Jaxon.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.116
- Sure, it's no problem.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.577
So, um, what do you need moved?

03:21.660 --> 03:25.205
- Um... this couch.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.457
Yeah. It's, uh...

03:27.541 --> 03:29.918
it's in the wrong place,
according to feng shui,

03:30.002 --> 03:31.628
so that's...

03:31.712 --> 03:34.298
you know, maybe that's why
my life is so messed up, right?

03:34.381 --> 03:38.177
- Yeah, um, where do you want it to go?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.139
- Um, here.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.225
Just, like, this-this side...
here, kind of.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.729
So, you're in, um, what,
you're in, like, ninth grade?

03:48.812 --> 03:49.855
- Eighth.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.441
- Eighth grade.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.027
Great. Cool.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.613
So, that's, like, the grade
where you get a...

03:57.696 --> 03:58.989
girlfriend or...?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.283
- No, not really.
- No?

04:01.366 --> 04:02.910
- Hey, is this gonna be weird?

04:02.993 --> 04:05.704
Um, 'cause the couch is
in front of the fireplace now.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.164
- Oh, huh, I'll just, um...

04:07.247 --> 04:09.082
I just won't use the fireplace anymore.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.085
- Yo, where are those nuts at?!

04:12.169 --> 04:13.670
- Um...

04:13.754 --> 04:15.797
Actually, I have a...

04:15.881 --> 04:19.092
another thing that needs
to be moved, and, uh,

04:19.176 --> 04:22.763
that thing is in... in my bedroom, so...

04:24.097 --> 04:25.599
This way.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.644
Oh, my gosh.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.854
I forgot I left out my friend.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.023
Have you seen one of these before?
- Hey.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.191
- They're very cool.

04:34.274 --> 04:38.487
They're basically, like,
a doll you have sex with,

04:38.570 --> 04:39.905
which is cool.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.740
- Okay, he gets it, Cody.
- Oh, okay.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.117
- Show him the lube.
- I'm not gonna show him the lube.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.410
This is crazy.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.539
- So, um, what do you need moved in here?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.542
- Um, so this is... um,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.127
this is my bottle of lubricant.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.088
- Tell him that it's lavender hibiscus.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.215
- This smells really good.
- Cody!

04:58.298 --> 04:59.967
Get out of here. You're weirding him out.
- Uh, you know what?

05:00.050 --> 05:02.511
I actually have piano,
so I-I got, I got to go.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.555
- No!
No, Cody, don't let him go!

05:04.638 --> 05:05.931
Don't let him go!

05:06.014 --> 05:07.516
Tell him about my new vagina!

05:07.599 --> 05:10.352
- Jaxon, can't you just-- Jaxon.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.146
Will you... will you please
just fuck my sex doll?!

05:16.650 --> 05:19.236
What did you think
was gonna happen?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.446
He's a kid. He probably
doesn't even have pubes.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.073
- You're saying he's out of my league?

05:23.156 --> 05:26.201
- No! What are you...

05:26.285 --> 05:28.912
I-- Barbara, I'm sorry.
I tried.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.414
You saw. I tried, okay?

05:30.497 --> 05:32.541
- It's fine.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.710
It's not your fault.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.336
I'm old.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.130
I'm outdated.
- Barb...

05:38.213 --> 05:40.632
Barbara, stop.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.759
You want to talk about old and outdated?

05:42.843 --> 05:46.388
Like, past her prime?
Like, look at me.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.348
- Cody, you realize

05:48.432 --> 05:51.768
I say all that mean shit to you because...

05:51.852 --> 05:54.438
I'm jealous.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.899
- What are you talking about?
- You're so hot.

05:56.982 --> 06:00.235
- Shut up. No, I'm not.
- You are.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.738
You are. You're, like, effortlessly hot.
- Shut up.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.282
- And, like, your tits are amazing.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.366
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

06:06.450 --> 06:08.660
- My tits are like, eh-- like, who cares?

06:08.744 --> 06:10.287
Like, they're nothing to write home about.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.997
- They are so gorgeous.
- I'm serious.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.874
- No, they're amazing.
- They're not. Feel.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.168
- Yes.
- No, I'm being serious. Feel.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.295
Feel.
- Ah.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.131
Dude, they're literally perfect.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.759
- Um, yours are perfect.
- Mine?

06:23.842 --> 06:25.469
I hate my boobs.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.639
They're, like, cold and hard
and, like, fake.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.474
- No. Uh, shut up.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.518
- They are. Feel.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.067
- Whatever.
They're so nice.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.445
- Thanks. I mean, yours are amazing.
