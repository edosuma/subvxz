A strong choice is better
than no choice at all.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.762
Here's what actually
happened.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.965
Stella Liebeck
was a 79-year-old woman

02:44.998 --> 02:47.201
whose grandson drove her
to McDonalds.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.470
She was in a parked car
holding hot coffee

02:49.503 --> 02:51.205
in her lap
when it spilled.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.242
Now, Stella openly admitted

02:54.275 --> 02:56.076
that the spill was
her mistake,

02:56.109 --> 02:58.312
but the results
were horrifying.

02:58.346 --> 03:01.215
She had third degree burns
on her legs and genitals,

03:01.249 --> 03:02.750
and she went into shock.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.686
She had to undergo
painful skin graft operations,

03:05.719 --> 03:07.087
and her surgeon said
it was one

03:07.120 --> 03:09.390
of the worst cases
he had ever seen.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.926
Stella was permanently
disfigured and nearly died.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.729
Third degree burns?
How is that possible?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.265
No one serves coffee
that hot.

03:17.298 --> 03:20.067
You're right.
Only a clown would.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.336
The reason Stella's injuries
were so severe

03:22.370 --> 03:24.071
is that McDonalds
was serving coffee

03:24.104 --> 03:26.940
at up to 190 degrees.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.676
That's almost
boiling!

03:28.709 --> 03:30.544
McDonalds themselves
even admitted that

03:30.578 --> 03:33.547
at that temperature,
their coffee was a hazard.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.115
In fact,
in the decade prior,

03:35.148 --> 03:37.585
over 700 people
notified McDonalds

03:37.618 --> 03:39.553
that they had been burned
by their coffee.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.555
Holy crow!

03:41.589 --> 03:42.690
The real irony is,

03:42.723 --> 03:44.592
Stella didn't even
want to go to court.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.394
She just wanted McDonalds
to help pay

03:46.427 --> 03:49.630
her $20,000 in out-of-pocket
medical expenses.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.699
But after making her wait
for six months,

03:51.732 --> 03:54.868
they only
offered her 800 bucks.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.804
Stella tried to get McDonalds
to settle.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.806
She even agreed to mediation.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.308
But McDonalds
wouldn't budge.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.277
They gave her no choice
but to go to court.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.279
So when the jury heard
Stella's story,

04:05.313 --> 04:08.382
they found that McDonalds
had acted so irresponsibly,

04:08.416 --> 04:09.950
they had to be punished.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.420
They burned 700 people?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.087
This has gotta stop!

04:14.121 --> 04:16.590
Let's fine them
two days' coffee sales.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.759
That's 2.7 million.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.562
That ought to teach 'em
a lesson.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.263
It does.
Robble-robble.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.598
And, it worked.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.167
In the end, Stella settled
for less than 600 grand.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.569
But that was enough
to get McDonalds

04:28.602 --> 04:31.339
to lower their temperature
and stop burning people.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.273
This was an incredibly
rare case where

04:33.307 --> 04:35.108
a working-class victim
actually beat

04:35.142 --> 04:36.844
a huge team
of corporate lawyers

04:36.877 --> 04:38.846

a better place.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.781
Wow, how do I not
know about this?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.082
Because those
corporate lawyers

04:42.115 --> 04:44.017

at their jobs.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.520

that there was

04:48.155 --> 04:50.591

of frivolous lawsuits."

04:50.624 --> 04:52.426

bought it.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.414
create front groups like
"Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse"

05:46.447 --> 05:49.149
to try and turn public opinion
against lawsuits.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.486
This included companies
like Pfizer and Texaco

05:52.520 --> 05:55.589
and big tobacco companies
like Philip Morris.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.757
Philip Morris?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.759
Yeah, and by spreading
this false story,

05:58.792 --> 05:59.860
they got everyone to believe

05:59.893 --> 06:01.895
that silly lawsuits
were rampant.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.197
And nothing could be
further from the truth.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.599

06:05.633 --> 06:07.568

of personal injury lawsuits

06:07.601 --> 06:08.936
in recent decades has declined.

06:08.969 --> 06:13.040

06:24.084 --> 06:26.887

08:46.393 --> 08:47.494
Well, if they're just like us,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.763
then they're gonna make
a lot of mistakes.

08:49.797 --> 08:53.567
It is a testament to democracy
that our justice system

08:53.601 --> 08:55.903
gives such awesome power
to average citizens.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.905
But that also means
that our juries

08:57.938 --> 08:59.873
are subject to the same biases

08:59.907 --> 09:02.109
we carry with us
in everyday life.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.343
Like what?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.245
Like the way that
people in my building

09:05.278 --> 09:07.214
are biased against me
for owning ferrets?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.448
Uh, not quite.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.618
But one study did find
that juries recommend

09:10.651 --> 09:14.254
more lenient sentences
to attractive defendants.

09:14.287 --> 09:19.392
The only thing I steal are...
women's hearts.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.128
Also sometimes purses.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.763
"Hot" guilty.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.131
I mean, not guilty.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.267
And juries actually find
defendants guilty less often

09:27.300 --> 09:29.136
if they're wearing glasses.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.139
It's known as the nerd defense.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.108
What a nerd, I bet he wasn't
even invited to the crime.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.144
I mean, who's
his getaway driver?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.979
His mom.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.981
Sick burn, bro.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.784
Seriously, dude's a wiener.
Not guilty.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.219
These biases are so powerful

09:46.253 --> 09:47.955
there's actually
an entire industry

09:47.988 --> 09:49.923
of highly paid trial consultants

09:49.957 --> 09:52.459
who help lawyers
learn and exploit them.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.661
No, no, no.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.663
Our research shows
you're most likely convict

09:55.696 --> 09:58.298
with black men over 65,
Mexican babies,

09:58.331 --> 10:00.801
and all people named Jackie.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.503
Hmm. Who Jackie?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.906
The rest of you are dismissed.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.675
In some cases, the consultants

10:07.708 --> 10:10.510
even screen potential
juror's Facebook pages

10:10.543 --> 10:13.180
to decide who to keep
and who to send home.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.683
Facebook says his favorite
Batman is Val Kilmer.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.350
What terrible judgement.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.352
We have to have
him on the jury.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.988
These biases may sound trivial,

10:21.021 --> 10:24.692
but the effect they have
on cases can be devastating.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.927
As my expert witness,
I now call to the stand

10:26.960 --> 10:28.862
law professor Adam Benforado.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.097
I do.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.431
I object!

10:31.464 --> 10:33.000
You can't call anyone
to the stand.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.435
You're not a lawyer,
you're a TV clown.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.105
I'll allow it.
Proceed, TV clown.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.272
(Rhea groans)

10:39.306 --> 10:40.808
(clears throat)

10:40.841 --> 10:43.877
Professor Benforado,
is it not true

10:43.911 --> 10:45.545
that you have
written a book entitled

10:45.578 --> 10:48.782
"Unfair, the New Science
of Criminal Injustice"?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.684
Yes, my research is all about

10:50.718 --> 10:52.786
the hidden biases
in our legal system.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.824
For example, political biases
can be far more influential

10:56.857 --> 11:00.027
on the outcome of a case
than what the law actually says.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.862
So in date rape cases,

11:01.895 --> 11:05.498
older more conservative women
are far more likely to acquit

11:05.532 --> 11:07.300
than younger more liberal women

11:07.334 --> 11:10.403
regardless of how the law
actually defines rape.

11:10.437 --> 11:14.307
Hmm. So justice is
not in fact blind.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.010
Am I right, Professor?
Sadly, you are.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.880
Our juries all see the world
through the tinted lens

11:19.913 --> 11:21.581
of their own biases,

11:21.614 --> 11:24.084
which is one of the reasons
why black defendants

11:24.117 --> 11:27.254
fare so much worse in our system
than white defendants.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.023
We've all been exposed
to damaging stereotypes

11:30.057 --> 11:33.660
that link blackness
with crime and violence.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.164
This can lead juries to assign
African American defendants

11:37.197 --> 11:39.933
longer sentences
than white defendants

11:39.967 --> 11:43.436
because they implicitly see them
as more of a threat.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.907
And is there not today
a half a billion dollar industry

11:46.940 --> 11:49.242
dedicated to exploiting
those biases?

11:49.276 --> 11:52.712
Bingo. Lawyers pay
trial consultants huge sums

11:52.746 --> 11:55.282
to ensure that they have
the most biased juries possible

11:55.315 --> 11:56.683
in their favor,

11:56.716 --> 11:59.452
which means
that a case can be won

11:59.486 --> 12:00.553
based on the selection
of the jury

12:00.587 --> 12:03.791
before the trial even begins.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.392
I'm losing it here, guys.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.796
Wha-- the jury is supposed
to take the trial seriously.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.964
Well, we sure don't
encourage them to.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.400
Virtually no one takes
jury duty seriously,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.302
including the government.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.637
Oh, we don't?

12:17.670 --> 12:19.239
What'cha talkn' about, Adam?

12:19.272 --> 12:23.811
In some states, jury duty pays
as little as $4 an hour.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.813
We actually pay the people
handing out death sentences

12:25.846 --> 12:28.982
less than the people
handing out fast food.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.984
Would you like
a verdict with that?

12:31.018 --> 12:32.319
Pay is so low,

12:32.352 --> 12:35.155
we treat jury duty like
it's some sort of punishment.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.224
In some cities
the turn out is so bad,

12:37.257 --> 12:40.227
they've had to postpone
murder trials.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.795
Trial postponed?

12:41.829 --> 12:44.764
Great, got a few more hours
to kill.

12:44.798 --> 12:45.999
(thunder crashes)

12:46.033 --> 12:47.467
And even when people do show up,

12:47.500 --> 12:50.070
they'll say just about anything
to get out of it.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.072
Sorry, I can't be on the jury

12:52.105 --> 12:55.175
because I've been
murdered before.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.343
Think about that.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.846
Your fate is being decided
by a random person

12:58.879 --> 13:00.313
who's paid poverty wages

13:00.347 --> 13:03.116
and would rather be doing
literally anything else.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.417
So ask yourself,

13:04.451 --> 13:07.754
is it any wonder they fall back
on irrational biases?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.191

Oh, well, I know

18:01.080 --> 18:02.215
And I know that the press

18:02.249 --> 18:03.416
don't always get
the story straight,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.752
so that's why I suck up
to the local beat reporter.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.755
Wait, so you don't
really like my jam band?

18:10.957 --> 18:13.460
And I know the prosecution
have five times the staff,

18:13.493 --> 18:16.129
that's why I work
five times as hard.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.165
The justice system
isn't perfect.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.666
That's because it's
made up of people

18:19.699 --> 18:21.501
and people aren't
perfect either.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.836
But you want to know why
I trust the system?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.972
It's because I know
there are people just like me

18:26.005 --> 18:28.775
working every single day
to make it better.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.810
It's easy to stand in front
of a camera

18:30.843 --> 18:31.911
and rattle off criticisms

18:31.944 --> 18:32.912
while you wait
for a perfect world

18:32.945 --> 18:33.946
to fall in your lap.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.448
But while you do that,

18:35.482 --> 18:38.017
I'm gonna dig in,
work my ass off,

18:38.050 --> 18:39.619
and make sure
your innocent friend

18:39.652 --> 18:41.354
doesn't go to prison.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.855
So how about you
let me do that?

18:43.856 --> 18:45.358
(Judge Kurt laughing)

18:45.392 --> 18:46.793
Woof! Yes!

18:46.826 --> 18:49.829
Ha! Hatchy matchy.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.665
Now that is some
of the best damn lawyer talk

18:52.699 --> 18:53.700
I've ever heard.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.535
Hey, maybe the entire premise

18:55.568 --> 18:57.304
of your show is flawed,
huh, Adam?

18:57.337 --> 18:58.471
(chuckling)

18:58.505 --> 19:00.273
All right, let's get this trial
on the road.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.608
I think if we beat feet,

19:01.641 --> 19:02.709
we can get a verdict
in three minutes.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.847
(gavel banging)

19:07.880 --> 19:09.716
Has the jury reached a verdict?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.284
We have, Your Honor.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.852
We find the defendant...

19:12.885 --> 19:14.821
Kendra Perkins...

19:14.854 --> 19:16.289
not guilty.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.826
♪♪

19:19.859 --> 19:21.994
(Judge Kurt)
Oh man, great, great.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.896
All right, well,
we can all go home.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.065
Expect for you, Kendra,
you'll be getting the chair.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.034
♪♪

19:28.067 --> 19:31.170
Come on, I'm kidding!
I'm kidding!

19:31.204 --> 19:34.707
All right, Judge Kurt out.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.509
I don't know
how to thank you.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.345
You don't have to,
I'm honored to do it.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.412
(watch beeps)
Oh.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.580
Got to run to another case.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.814
You know how things are.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.182
Congrats, guys

19:43.216 --> 19:44.284
I'm so excited!

19:46.553 --> 19:48.721
(Kendra)
Tomorrow, I get a job.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.756
Tonight, I get a drink.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.524
Let's get the French
out of here.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.525
You coming, Adam?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.361
No, you two go ahead.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.563
I don't really think
I deserve to come.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.498
Why are you saying that?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.699
Rhea's right.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.701
I didn't do anything to help.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.371
All I do is talk about
what's wrong.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.206
I know every reason
the justice system is broken,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.075
but I never do
anything to fix it.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.344
Oh, were you not
just paying attention?

20:11.378 --> 20:13.546
Everyone can make a difference,
you said that.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.048
I did? Sometimes I zone out
while I'm talking.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.417
Jury duty.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.752
Every few years, every American
is giving the chance

20:19.786 --> 20:20.753
to take part in the system.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.221
For that one case,

20:22.255 --> 20:24.457
you have the power
to fix these problems.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.560
All you have to do is show up,
check your biases,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.729
and make sure you hear
both sides out.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.631
Oh, yeah, wow.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.232
That's actually really cool.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.968
Yeah, and will you stop
mopping about yourself?

20:36.002 --> 20:39.071
I just won my trial,
you owe me a shot or two.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.741
Yeah, let's get "nootched"!

20:41.774 --> 20:43.075
What does that mean?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.244
Oh, it's a new word
I'm trying out for drunk.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.880
You know, so you can be like,
"Oh, sorry, man.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.716
Last night I was nootched."
(chuckling)

20:49.749 --> 20:53.386
You know, or you can be like,
"Oh, I nootched texted him."

20:53.420 --> 20:57.957
Hey, and so then I say,
"3.5 billion,

20:57.990 --> 21:02.829
that's how many years my wife
spends in the bathroom."

21:02.862 --> 21:04.631
(man)
You're guilty of sucking!

21:04.664 --> 21:07.099
Sheesh. Rough crowd.
