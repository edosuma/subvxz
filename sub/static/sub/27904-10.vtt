WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.395
ADAM:
I'm telling you, Teddy,

00:04.439 --> 00:05.527
you looked great
at baseball today.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.529
All we need to
work on is hitting.

00:07.572 --> 00:10.053
And throwing and catching.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.968
Everything else
you got locked down.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.187
Thanks.
[chuckles]

00:13.230 --> 00:14.492
Hey, when we get home,

00:14.536 --> 00:15.798
can I finally drive
your truck up the driveway?

00:15.841 --> 00:18.409
I wish you could,
but you remember our deal.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.454
You have to be taller
than that mark

00:19.497 --> 00:20.977
I put on your bedroom door.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.023
But I keep growing,
and I never get any closer.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.808
It's weird. It's like
the mark is getting higher.

00:25.851 --> 00:29.899
Huh. That is weird.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.815
Hey, hey, no feet
on the dashboard.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.860
You want to drive
Grey Thunder someday,

00:34.904 --> 00:36.862
show some respect.

00:36.906 --> 00:39.604
Sorry, Grey Thunder.
Yeah.

00:39.648 --> 00:40.605
I'm just looking out for you.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.477
It's like I always say,

00:42.520 --> 00:43.739
you get what you want...

00:43.782 --> 00:45.088
BOTH:
By knowing
what other people want.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.829
That's right.
That's right.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.484
And when you're older, if you
get in your girlfriend's car

00:49.527 --> 00:51.094
and put your feet up
on the dashboard,

00:51.138 --> 00:53.401
that date does not end
in a smooch.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.664
I want the smooch; that's the
only reason I play baseball.

00:55.707 --> 01:00.060
[chuckles]
That's the only reason
we do anything.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.626
So how's school?

01:01.670 --> 01:03.715
I got an English paper
back today, and I got an "A."

01:03.759 --> 01:05.717
Right on.
[chuckles]

01:05.761 --> 01:07.545
I had to write an essay
on who my hero is.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.592
Your hero, huh?

01:13.464 --> 01:14.509
Enough said.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.167
Hey, Teddy.
How was baseball?

01:20.210 --> 01:22.560
Did you face the right way
this time?

01:22.604 --> 01:23.648
Nothing hit me.

01:26.564 --> 01:29.306
Hey, this season's
shaping up.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.655
What's, uh,
what-what's this?

01:30.699 --> 01:31.830
"Just dream"?

01:31.874 --> 01:33.571
Oh, yeah.
I painted it myself.

01:33.615 --> 01:34.790
What do you think?

01:34.833 --> 01:36.139
Well, I think
if you want something

01:36.183 --> 01:37.575
for our neighbors to read,
how about

01:37.619 --> 01:38.924
"tell your husband
to close the blinds

01:38.968 --> 01:41.927
when he showers"?!

01:41.971 --> 01:44.234
Okay, well, I don't have to,

01:44.278 --> 01:46.106
because you yell it at him
every time you get the paper.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.849
I think the chair is inspiring.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.591
Well, if you want inspiration,

01:53.635 --> 01:56.377
there's something very special
in Teddy's backpack.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.380
Uh-oh, did he leave
another ham sandwich in there?

01:59.423 --> 02:02.165
I'm not digging that deep.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.472
I'm gonna stay in the upper
half, where everything's dry.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.691
Here it is.

02:06.735 --> 02:09.085
Why don't you read this
grade A work

02:09.129 --> 02:11.522
of literature aloud while I make
room for it on the fridge.

02:11.566 --> 02:12.523
Hmm.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.699
Let's see.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.615
"'My Hero,' by Teddy Burns."
[chuckles]

02:17.659 --> 02:20.444
"Who is my hero?
This question is easy.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.620
My hero is my mother,
Andi Burns"?

02:22.664 --> 02:23.665
[gasps]

02:26.233 --> 02:30.106
Very funny.
Read-read the real one.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.542
No, no, no, no, look.
Look, honey,

02:31.586 --> 02:33.544
I thought for sure
it was gonna be you.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.416
[chuckles]

02:40.638 --> 02:43.641
Nope. It says "mom"
everywhere on here.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.600
[chuckles]
Yeah.

02:45.643 --> 02:48.864
This is gonna look great
on the fridge.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.301
â™ª

02:59.788 --> 03:01.442
Here's your cocoa, Emme.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.270
I gave you
extra marshmallows.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.315
Thanks, Daddy.
[chuckling]:
Yeah.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.404
You know, in a few years,

03:07.448 --> 03:09.624
you're gonna get
an assignment at school.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.105
Something about a hero.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.587
And you know what rhymes
with "hero"?

03:16.631 --> 03:19.199
Marshmallow.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.723
Daddy, marshmallow, hero.
That's how you remember that.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.465
Okay. I'm going outside.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.466
Okay.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.903
Hey, sit in my new chair.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.861
And don't forget to dream.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.647
Maybe dream about the guy
who gave you marshmallows.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.086
Hey, where'd Teddy's essay go?

03:37.129 --> 03:39.175
Oh, that?
I-I thought it looked better

03:39.219 --> 03:41.917
on the back of the pantry door.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.353
You hid my essay?

03:44.354 --> 03:46.574
Why, so people wouldn't see it?No.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.228
We're talking
about the pantry here.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.881
Tons of foot traffic.

03:49.925 --> 03:53.711
And the-the pantry is really
the heart of the home.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.713
Yeah, that's where
all our favorite stuff is.

03:55.757 --> 04:00.327
The snacks and the-the,
the, uh, broom.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.200
What are you doing?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.289
Nothing.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.378
[chuckles]
What are you doing?

04:08.422 --> 04:12.556
I think I'm watching you
make an ass of yourself.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.255
I'm fine.
You're the one who's cursing.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.432
Is it the essay?

04:18.475 --> 04:19.824
Maybe we should just
get rid of that thing.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.610
It is tearing this family apart.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.307
You're jealous.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.569
I know.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.702
Get ahold of yourself, man.

04:27.745 --> 04:28.746
I can't!

04:30.661 --> 04:32.663
Why don't you just take comfort
in that fact that,

04:32.707 --> 04:34.317
even though Teddy
didn't pick you,

04:34.361 --> 04:37.538
he picked the person that you
love the most in the world?

04:41.106 --> 04:44.458
You heroes make me sick.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.330
Uh, sorry, I-I missed
that last part,

04:47.374 --> 04:49.854
'cause all I heard was,
"You hero."

04:49.898 --> 04:52.857
Yeah, everything's funny
to the person on the fridge.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.905
Come on, are you really
gonna make this a thing?

04:56.948 --> 04:58.602
I'm not making it a thing.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.823
You're the one moonwalking
in the end zone.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.912
Well, I think I deserve it.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.218
I mean, after all,
I did give birth to him.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.830
On a bed.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.224
I had to stand in a
cold delivery room

05:12.268 --> 05:14.749
for seven hours.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.012
Not to mention you got
$20,000 worth of drugs.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.492
I couldn't even get a Coke!

05:19.797 --> 05:22.974
I know, I crossed the line.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.588
So I'm gonna go
sit in your chair

05:27.631 --> 05:29.198
and dream I never said it.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.986
[chuckles weakly]

05:37.859 --> 05:38.947
If it makes you
feel any better,

05:38.990 --> 05:40.427
you're myhero.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.690
Great. Can you stand
in front of my refrigerator

05:42.733 --> 05:44.431
and say that to everyone
that walks by?

05:44.474 --> 05:46.650
Can I bring a stool?

05:46.694 --> 05:48.696
Look, all I'm saying is,
if it's not on a piece of paper,

05:48.739 --> 05:49.740
it doesn't help me.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.656
It's not too late
to win Teddy over.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.397
He's a 12-year-old boy.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.618
All you have to do is save
the planet from aliens. Easy.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.969
I'm a little short
on aliens right now, Don.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.667
I'm just the idea man here.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.062
Afternoon, men.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.324
Hey, Pop, I'm ready.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.065
My tackle box is
in the truck.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.372
Where you guys going?Fishing.

06:12.415 --> 06:13.634
When did you make this plan?

06:13.677 --> 06:14.678
Last night at dinner.

06:14.722 --> 06:15.679
You guys had dinner?

06:15.723 --> 06:17.333
Yeah, before bingo.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.727
You guys played bingo?

06:19.770 --> 06:21.381
Maybe get your ears checked.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.425
You don't hear so good.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.644
Good one, Pop.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.733
We'll laugh about that
on the boat.[laughs]

06:25.776 --> 06:27.778
[both continue laughing]

06:30.912 --> 06:32.783
Did you see that?

06:32.827 --> 06:35.699
They're going
fishing without me.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.309
Well, maybe let your dad
and your brother

06:37.353 --> 06:38.833
not wanting
to spend time with you

06:38.876 --> 06:41.749
take your mind off your son
not looking up to you.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.406
I could have said that better.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.800
How could Teddy not think
I'm his hero?

06:49.844 --> 06:52.324
I'm the greatest man
he's ever known.

06:52.368 --> 06:53.935
Maybe you're too humble.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.459
That's it.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.113
I am good at a lot of things,

06:58.156 --> 07:00.158
and one of the things I'm
best at is being humble.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.595
[laughs]

07:01.638 --> 07:03.640
Oh. Uh-huh.
Makes sense.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.903
See, the problem is,

07:05.947 --> 07:08.471
I haven't been showing
Teddy my best qualities.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.821
He only sees me as Dad.

07:10.865 --> 07:14.042
I need to show him the
man behind the dad.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.479
Well, until then,
you're my hero,

07:16.523 --> 07:18.089
and per your request,
here it is,

07:18.133 --> 07:20.004
documented on paper.

07:20.048 --> 07:24.052
Thanks, Lowell, but it's
not really the same thing.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.880
It does spruce up
the office, though.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.713
Teddy, look what I found.

07:32.756 --> 07:37.239
The Adam Burns Golden Box
of Childhood Accomplishments.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.110
Huh?

07:39.154 --> 07:42.505
Isn't that the box Mom's always
asking you to throw away?

07:42.549 --> 07:44.768
That's 'cause she's jealous.
Where's her box, huh?

07:44.812 --> 07:45.900
I didn't think so.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.902
You see,

07:47.945 --> 07:50.687
I don't think you know
who your old man really is.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.123
All right?
Like, check this out.

07:53.429 --> 07:59.696
"Local 4-H boy saves cow,
delivers emergency calf."

07:59.740 --> 08:02.830
That boy, your dad.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.353
I believe a couple
paragraphs down

08:04.396 --> 08:08.139
they call me a hero.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.793
Whoa.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.622
Exactly. Whoa.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.842
You put your hand
up a cow's butt?

08:17.975 --> 08:20.804
What? No.
It wasn't the butt.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.850
What was it, then?

08:26.418 --> 08:27.985
[stammering]

08:28.029 --> 08:30.814
Well, it's complicated.
[clears throat]

08:30.858 --> 08:32.860
Why, what else is back there?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.432
Uh...

08:41.651 --> 08:42.739
Fine, it was the butt.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.964
Hey, did you find me a spider?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.009
Yeah. I can always find
one on the rowing machine

08:52.053 --> 08:54.795
that Marcy swore she
would use every day.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.841
I think he was living
in her web of lies.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.409
[chuckles]
Great, I'm gonna use it
to impress Teddy.

09:00.452 --> 09:04.500
My cow butt article
didn't do anything.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.502
Then, I remembered that Teddy's
really scared of spiders.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.504
Now, I might not be able
to save him from aliens,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.375
but I can save him
from one of those.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.942
I'm glad you listened
to the smart guy for once.

09:11.986 --> 09:12.943
[chuckles]

09:12.987 --> 09:15.903
Whoa, almost drank a spider.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.165
Yeah, close one.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.906
Mm.
Now, listen.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.908
When Teddy comes down,
you act scared,

09:20.951 --> 09:23.954
I'll kill the spider
and look like a hero. Huh?

09:23.998 --> 09:25.869
All right.
Teddy, your snack is ready!

09:25.913 --> 09:26.870
Okay, let him go.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.132
No, no, no, you do it.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.133
He saw my face
when I grabbed him.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.178
He's already mad at me.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.531
There's nothing in here.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.750
Maybe he's on the lid.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.142
Whoa, it's on my hand!

09:38.186 --> 09:40.188
Where'd it go?

09:40.231 --> 09:42.364
Where'd what go?There's a spider loose in here.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.975
What?! Where?!

09:45.019 --> 09:46.455
Why are you running to him?

09:46.498 --> 09:47.456
Because it's on you.

09:47.499 --> 09:50.024
What?!

09:50.067 --> 09:51.591
What's going on?

09:51.634 --> 09:52.766
There was a spider on me, Andi.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.942
Wha...?

09:57.684 --> 09:59.729
Done.

09:59.773 --> 10:03.167
You used my Golden
Accomplishment.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.953
That was incredible, Mom.
You really are a hero.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.172
[scoffs]

10:12.263 --> 10:15.789
I stood up the whole time
you were being born.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.141
She just laid there.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.665
High as a kite!

10:27.539 --> 10:29.672
Hey, buddy.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.848
You need a little help
with your homework?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.284
I'm an ace at it.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.417
You might even call me
a homework hero. [chuckles]

10:35.460 --> 10:37.245
That'd be great; it's math.

10:37.288 --> 10:40.509
Okay... hit me.

10:40.552 --> 10:44.121
How do I factor a polynomial?

10:47.472 --> 10:50.084
Hey, you want to drive my truck
up the driveway?

10:53.957 --> 10:55.306
What are we gonna do?

10:55.350 --> 10:57.874
I said go right.I did go right.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.876
Your other right.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.312
[sighs]

11:08.276 --> 11:10.234
Ah, here comes Mom,
she's gonna kill me.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.236
Wha... Okay, uh, all right,
you go in the house.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.239
I'll take the hit.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.850
Which, if you have to do
another hero essay,

11:16.893 --> 11:18.634
might be something
you think about!

11:21.506 --> 11:23.378
What happened to my chair?

11:23.421 --> 11:26.424
My inspiring chair?

11:26.468 --> 11:28.688
Well, uh, well,
it told me to dream,

11:28.731 --> 11:32.517
so... I dozed off.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.390
Yeah. Your next chair should say

11:35.433 --> 11:37.827
"Don't leave me
in the driveway."

11:37.871 --> 11:40.438
Mm-hmm. You know
what I think happened?

11:40.482 --> 11:42.571
Hmm?You're still so mad
about that essay

11:42.614 --> 11:44.225
that you took it out
on my chair.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.271
Yeah, you are literally
a dream crusher.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.447
That's not true.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.493
Okay, well, what other
explanation is there?

11:51.536 --> 11:52.929
Teddy did it.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.107
You let Teddy drive?

11:57.151 --> 11:58.195
Wha...

11:58.239 --> 12:00.241
He can't even peel a banana.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.505
He just squeezes it
into his mouth like a Go-Gurt.

12:03.548 --> 12:06.508
It was just up and down
the driveway.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.728
How was I supposed to know
he'd be as bad at driving

12:08.771 --> 12:10.730
as he is at picking heroes?

12:12.035 --> 12:13.907
And there it is.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.779
I'm the dad, he
should have picked me.

12:16.823 --> 12:20.217
I mean, yeah, I'm happy for you,
blah, blah, blah, you're great.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.567
But fathers and sons?

12:22.611 --> 12:23.612
That's deep stuff.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.570
There's hit songs about it.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.878
Uh, the-- "Cat's in the Cradle,"
"Danny Boy,"

12:28.922 --> 12:30.314
that music

12:30.358 --> 12:34.101
they play when Darth Vader
walks in.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.973
Okay, but, honey, none of this
means you're a bad father.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.540
No, no.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.411
It means I'm not
even worth mentioning.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.892
You know what it's like?

12:42.936 --> 12:46.591
If I am not his hero,
what's the point?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.942
It's like I have
no effect on him.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.335
Oh, hon-- well, I don't want you
to feel like that.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.555
And it's not true.
Uh, the other day,

12:53.598 --> 12:56.950
I saw him drinking milk from
the carton in his underwear.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.647
Yeah.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.563
He didn't get that from me.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.654
[speaks gibberish]

13:05.697 --> 13:08.875
All boys pick their dads
as their heroes.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.747
I wrote one of those essays
in school, too.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.270
Come on, I'll show you.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.142
Oh, is this going to be

13:15.185 --> 13:17.231
the golden box of kid junk?

13:17.274 --> 13:20.495
It's called
the Adam Burns Golden Box

13:20.538 --> 13:23.498
of Childhood Accomplishments,
and you know it.

13:24.542 --> 13:27.894
Is this it?

13:27.937 --> 13:30.679
"Top ten ways I'm exactly
like Burt Reynolds."

13:33.725 --> 13:35.771
"Number one,
awesome mustache."

13:35.815 --> 13:37.338
[laughs]

13:38.556 --> 13:41.298
Wait, this is on
a 2002 calendar.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.431
W-We were married then.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.959
Here it is.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.961
"'My Hero,' by Adam Burns."

13:52.005 --> 13:54.181
Now listen carefully.
You listening?

13:54.224 --> 13:55.747
Yeah.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.489
"My hero is a man of integrity

13:58.533 --> 14:01.710
"who always takes the time
to make me feel special.

14:01.753 --> 14:04.234
His name
is Ronald McDonald--" what?

14:07.324 --> 14:09.805
Your dad is Ronald McDonald?

14:11.720 --> 14:14.070
Why aren't we rich?

14:14.114 --> 14:18.205
I can't believe
I didn't pick my dad.

14:18.248 --> 14:21.295
No wonder he doesn't
take me fishing.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.299
All these years,
his feelings have been hurt.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.605
Come on. You really think
he's so thin-skinned

14:27.649 --> 14:29.869
that he would care
about a school...

14:29.912 --> 14:32.523
No, that's-- people do
that, that's a thing.

14:34.961 --> 14:38.660
Hey, Dad, uh,
I'm glad you're here.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.445
I-I have something
to say to you and it's, uh,

14:41.489 --> 14:43.926
kind of,
it's kind of delicate.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.059
If you've come to take your
mother and me to a home,

14:46.102 --> 14:48.061
then I hope you
brought backup.

14:48.104 --> 14:52.065
No, no, I just wanted
to apologize for something.

14:52.108 --> 14:55.895
When I was a kid, I wrote an
essay at school about my hero,

14:55.938 --> 15:00.682
and I didn't pick you,
and I am really, really sorry.

15:00.725 --> 15:04.642
Son, I've been waiting to
hear you say those words

15:04.686 --> 15:06.731
for 40 years.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.211
Really?

15:08.255 --> 15:10.213
No, I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.607
Yes, you do.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.087
In sixth grade,
I picked Ronald McDonald

15:14.130 --> 15:15.827
as my hero instead of you.

15:15.871 --> 15:18.613
So what? I don't care
about being your hero.

15:18.656 --> 15:19.744
You don't?
No.

15:19.788 --> 15:20.963
Because I'm not Teddy's,

15:21.007 --> 15:22.704
and it's driving me crazy.

15:22.747 --> 15:25.576
It's like I'm not even there,
I have no effect on him.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.752
Oh, so you want to
talk about feelings.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.580
Uh, well, your
mother's at the mall.

15:29.624 --> 15:30.755
Maybe I can get her
on speakerphone.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.801
You know what,
I-I'll handle it.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.672
All right, all right, hold
your horses, little lady.

15:34.716 --> 15:35.891
Come back over here.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.766
Look.
[sighs]

15:41.810 --> 15:43.768
Don't take this Teddy
thing personally.

15:43.812 --> 15:48.251
Kids are... what's a
nice word for it? Dumb.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.993
They only look up to people
who tell them they're great

15:51.037 --> 15:53.648
when they're not, and
dads don't do that.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.650
Well, no, it doesn't
teach 'em anything.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.739
If we were supposed
to just hug 'em all the time,

15:57.782 --> 16:00.655
they wouldn't make
our faces so scratchy.
Mm.

16:00.698 --> 16:03.919
My job as a father was to
make sure that when you went

16:03.963 --> 16:06.704
out in the world, you
wouldn't be a jackass.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.489
I'm the guy that told you
you weren't funny.

16:08.532 --> 16:11.535
And that's why today
you are a little funny.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.711
You think I'm funny?

16:13.755 --> 16:15.757
A little, I said.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.802
And you do the
same with Teddy.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.848
Yeah. I tell him
what he's doing wrong,

16:19.891 --> 16:21.937
so when he grows up,
he'll do something right.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.767
Yeah. As I see it, I did a
better job at being a dad

16:25.810 --> 16:29.684
than my pop did, and you're
doing a better job than I did.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.904
I'll take that.
Hmm.

16:32.948 --> 16:36.604
Wait, so if you're not mad
about the essay,

16:36.647 --> 16:38.736
wh-why do you take
Don fishing and not me?

16:38.780 --> 16:42.001
He's tall. He makes
a lot of shade.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.525
He's like sitting under a
tree that gets you beers.

16:44.568 --> 16:48.920
Also, he needs more
coddling than you.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.140
Ha. He does. Baby.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.968
He's such a baby.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.407
But if you want, we can talk
about how much I love you, son.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.974
Really?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.715
I oobie doobie
love you so much.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.934
Come and sit
on Daddy's lap.

17:02.978 --> 17:06.068
Well, it was nice there
for a second.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.505
A father's work
is never done.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.211
Come on, we got
a surprise for you.

17:18.254 --> 17:21.953
Teddy, show her
what's behind door number one.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.520
What door?

17:23.564 --> 17:26.697
Take off the sheet
on your right.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.221
Your other right.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.267
[gasps]

17:31.311 --> 17:34.488
Oh, my God, you fixed it.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.880
Oh, I love it.

17:35.924 --> 17:36.925
Yeah, well, wait, wait,
wait, there's more.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.100
Teddy, show her.

17:40.842 --> 17:43.497
Huh? We made a set.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.978
"Just dream... of beer."

17:47.022 --> 17:48.763
Now it says something.Aw.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.765
His and hers.Yeah.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.419
Thanks, guys.Yeah. Hey, uh, Teddy,

17:52.462 --> 17:54.247
will you go get a dust rag
out of the garage?

17:57.032 --> 17:59.861
Look, I just wanted to do this
to say I'm sorry for being

17:59.904 --> 18:03.343
a little high maintenance
about the hero thing.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.171
A little?

18:06.607 --> 18:09.044
It was like living
with Mariah Carey.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.875
Hey, if moms get to be
their sons' heroes,

18:13.918 --> 18:17.922
then dads deserve the right
to be oversensitive.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.795
You guys have had that
for centuries, it's our turn.

18:22.623 --> 18:27.149
All right, then we get to be
the next 45 presidents.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.458
Fair enough.

18:35.244 --> 18:38.291
Hey, uh,
I meant to tell you...

18:40.031 --> 18:42.338
I am really proud of you
for writing that great essay

18:42.382 --> 18:43.861
about your mother.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.995
Thanks. My plan
went perfectly.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.867
What plan?

18:49.911 --> 18:53.349
Well, my teacher is a mom,
so when I had to pick a hero,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.003
I picked my mom.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.179
Like you always say,
you get what you want...

18:57.223 --> 19:01.444
BOTH:
By knowing
what other people want.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.447
Good job, buddy.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.449
[chuckles]
Yeah, well...

19:06.493 --> 19:09.322
[sighs]

19:09.365 --> 19:12.977
I guess we know
who your real hero is, huh?

19:13.021 --> 19:13.978
Oh, yeah.[laughs]

19:14.022 --> 19:15.980
LeBron James.

19:19.114 --> 19:22.770
Great choice.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.120
I need to be alone
for a minute.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.216
"Strength. Integrity.
Coins behind my ear.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.654
That's my dad, Joe Burns,
and that's why he's my hero."

19:40.831 --> 19:44.835
That's beautiful.
Never gets old, son.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.359
Hey, Adam, why don't you read
Dad your essay

19:46.402 --> 19:47.882
about him being your hero?

19:47.925 --> 19:49.666
You know I didn't
write about Dad.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.234
Oh, that's right,
who'd you pick?

19:52.278 --> 19:55.411
The Hamburglar?
O-Or was it Mayor McCheese?

19:55.455 --> 19:59.241
Dad only takes you fishing
for the shade.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.982
You're a beer tree.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.113
What?

20:02.157 --> 20:03.680
Why are you
causing trouble?

20:03.724 --> 20:05.291
A brother's work
is never done.
