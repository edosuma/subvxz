00:01.008 --> 00:02.449
Previously on Riverdale...

00:02.452 --> 00:04.468
I want to be more than
just your errand boy.

00:04.471 --> 00:05.921
Or casual hookup.

00:05.924 --> 00:07.588
I want to matter, Ronnie.

00:07.591 --> 00:10.517
I just went through a wrenching breakup.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.756
I'm taking things slow.

00:11.759 --> 00:13.350
Sweet Pea, I told you that

00:13.353 --> 00:15.762
our summer fling was gonna
be just that, a fling.

00:15.765 --> 00:16.847
Can I kiss you?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.492
Archie...

00:18.495 --> 00:21.362
I can't spend all my time
cooped up in that house.

00:21.365 --> 00:23.687
It sounds like you
regret moving in with me.

00:25.372 --> 00:27.247
I've been hearing rumors
that you moved to town

00:27.250 --> 00:29.417
to take the drug trade from Hiram Lodge.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.347
It's about time the Joneses got
a taste of the American dream.

00:32.350 --> 00:33.528
What are you gonna do now?

00:33.531 --> 00:35.407
Protect my dad and
run my mom out of town.

00:35.409 --> 00:36.408
Do you want to help?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.323
Brother Kevin.

00:37.326 --> 00:41.605
Groups like the Farm prey on
emotionally vulnerable people.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.726
Midge was murdered during
your production of Carrie.

00:43.728 --> 00:45.618
This year's musical is Heathers.

00:45.621 --> 00:46.657
Any questions?

00:48.305 --> 00:49.849
Heathers: The Musical?

00:49.852 --> 00:51.360
Now how, in God's name,

00:51.363 --> 00:54.105
is a play about teen
violence and suicide

00:54.108 --> 00:55.816
a good idea in Riverdale,

00:55.819 --> 00:58.130
especially after the tragedy
of last year's musical?

00:58.133 --> 00:59.860
Please, Mayor Lodge.

00:59.863 --> 01:03.407
Yes, Heathers deals with teen
alienation and desperation,

01:03.410 --> 01:07.098
but its characters long for
simpler, more innocent times.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.801
It's ultimate message is
a rejection of nihilism.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.954
If you'll just listen to
the lyrics of the first song.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.509
Your plan's a good one, Jug.

02:49.511 --> 02:52.595
Your mom can't start dealing drugs
without a lab to make them in.

02:52.597 --> 02:54.127
So you find the lab, shut it down,

02:54.130 --> 02:57.286

Greetings, Heathers family.

05:33.653 --> 05:37.276
Now, before we start today, there's been
a slight change to our creative team.

05:37.279 --> 05:41.306
You all know Evelyn Evernever has
been helping me produce the musical.

05:41.315 --> 05:44.500
But I've also asked Evelyn to
step up and be my co-director.

05:47.272 --> 05:49.248
Yay! So fun!

05:49.686 --> 05:51.011
What?

05:51.014 --> 05:55.035
Kevin, no, you always
direct the musical alone.

05:55.038 --> 05:58.614
Which has been incredibly
stressful, Betty.

05:58.616 --> 06:00.968
Especially after last year's events.

06:00.970 --> 06:04.454
Can we just not talk about Midge?

06:04.456 --> 06:06.106
- Please?
- No.

06:06.109 --> 06:09.386
How about we do a rundown of everybody's
parts, catch Evelyn up to speed?

06:09.389 --> 06:11.720
I'm playing Veronica Sawyer,

06:11.722 --> 06:14.630
outcast turned Heather
turned outcast again.

06:14.632 --> 06:18.560
Hi, I'm Sweet Pea. Um, playing JD,

06:18.562 --> 06:21.058
Veronica Sawyer's bad boy love interest.

06:21.061 --> 06:22.176
Reggie Mantle.

06:22.179 --> 06:24.054
AKA jock Ram Sweeney.

06:24.057 --> 06:25.826
Gonna bro it up with my bud Arch here,

06:25.828 --> 06:30.163
just two single straight
dudes doing some theater.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.524
Given how much dancing
there is in Heathers,

06:33.526 --> 06:36.042
Evelyn and I felt we should
bring on a choreographer,

06:36.045 --> 06:39.263
so give a big Heathers hello

06:39.266 --> 06:42.991
to Riverdale's resident
fly girl, Toni Topaz!

06:48.461 --> 06:52.186
Um, does anyone have a
chainsaw, because what the...

- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

06:58.727 --> 07:01.737
Everything in your lives matters.

07:01.739 --> 07:06.700
There are universal truths within
each of your personal experiences.

07:06.702 --> 07:10.561
A you inside of me, a me inside of you.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.873
In rehearsal, we are going to explore

07:12.875 --> 07:15.259
our own personal traumas and experiences

07:15.262 --> 07:17.412
and exercise them through our art.

07:17.415 --> 07:18.712
All right,

07:18.714 --> 07:20.405
Cheryl, Veronica, Betty, "Candy Store,"

07:20.407 --> 07:23.300
set and costumes are
ready. Go get changed.

07:23.302 --> 07:25.785
So this number is about the Heathers's

07:25.787 --> 07:27.888
undeniable power.

07:27.890 --> 07:31.648
Each of you can get anything
you want at any time.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.693
So really unleash that force.

07:34.696 --> 07:37.229
We'll all start with some simple steps.

07:37.232 --> 07:38.899
Yeah, we got it, thanks.

07:38.901 --> 07:42.069
Uh, Toni has some fantastic choreo.

07:42.071 --> 07:43.207
How very.

07:43.210 --> 07:44.441
But my Heathers and I
have already worked out

07:44.443 --> 07:45.949
our own choreography

07:45.952 --> 07:49.863
Come on, Cheryl. I'm trying to

Your "warm-up" sermons?
"Exercising trauma through art"

Betty,

dissect these trust issues.

The Farm is producing and
I'm co-directing the musical

for one simple reason.

10:34.907 --> 10:36.326
To have big fun.

10:38.633 --> 10:40.675
In fact...

10:40.678 --> 10:42.856
Yeah. Okay. Um...

10:42.859 --> 10:44.450
Everyone, hi.

10:44.452 --> 10:46.160
Um, I know that cast parties

10:46.162 --> 10:48.255
are usually after opening night,

10:48.257 --> 10:52.025
but the Farm will be hosting
a little get-together tonight

10:52.028 --> 10:54.284
- at the former Sisters of Quiet Mercy...
- Sweet.

10:54.302 --> 10:58.350
And, um, I know it may seem
a little weird or methody,

10:58.353 --> 11:00.600
but come in costume.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.940
Let's go.

11:06.942 --> 11:10.020
Anything big come over the radio today?

11:10.023 --> 11:13.186
Yeah, as a matter of fact, there
were a string of pharmacy break-ins

11:13.189 --> 11:14.447
and, uh...

11:16.768 --> 11:19.268
Wasn't sure I was going
to tell you this, but, uh,

11:19.271 --> 11:20.704
Tent City was ransacked.

11:21.468 --> 11:22.956
Our old trailer was stolen.

11:25.420 --> 11:29.256
Wait, missing pharmaceuticals
and a stolen house on wheels?

11:29.259 --> 11:30.558
I mean, doesn't that sound like

11:30.561 --> 11:32.456
the makings of a mobile drug lab?

11:32.459 --> 11:33.857
It's possible, sure.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.612
I mean, Riverdale's filled
with a lot of desperate folks.

11:36.615 --> 11:38.672
Maybe the Serpents and I
can help you look for it.

11:38.675 --> 11:39.975
What, the trailer?

11:40.409 --> 11:41.758
Boy, it was worthless.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.927
Well, not to me.

11:44.646 --> 11:46.754
That was our home for how many years?

11:46.756 --> 11:47.814
Too many.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.890
Just popping in to change.

11:56.099 --> 11:57.640
There's a cast party tonight.

11:57.642 --> 11:58.683
Don't wait up.

11:58.685 --> 11:59.840
Uh, Veronica,

11:59.843 --> 12:01.760
we have to talk.

12:05.039 --> 12:06.708
Your mother and I are separating.

12:06.710 --> 12:07.772
What?

12:08.912 --> 12:10.337
No, you're not.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.743
Very funny.

12:13.249 --> 12:14.469
Um...

12:15.242 --> 12:18.076
I'll be staying at the
Five Seasons indefinitely.

12:18.079 --> 12:19.837
Wait, what is happening?

12:19.839 --> 12:21.214
It's already been decided.

12:23.092 --> 12:25.012
We wanted to tell you in person.

12:27.869 --> 12:29.269
No, Daddy...

12:29.272 --> 12:32.702
Whatever this is, we can figure
it out as a family. Just...

12:32.705 --> 12:35.236
Can someone please
tell me what's going on?

12:37.344 --> 12:38.677
Ask your mother.

12:46.831 --> 12:48.083
Mom?

12:50.379 --> 12:51.703
He knows, Veronica.

12:51.705 --> 12:52.954
Knows what?

12:52.956 --> 12:54.877
The truth.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.610
He knows I sold the drugs out from
under him while he was in the hospital.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.074

13:09.314 --> 13:10.845
What are you gonna do?

13:10.848 --> 13:12.188
I'm gonna take a bath.

13:15.979 --> 13:17.859
You have fun with your friends.

13:18.973 --> 13:21.390
Well, given the night I've been having,

13:21.392 --> 13:23.868
I, for one, could use a libation, so...

13:24.751 --> 13:25.895
Salud.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.416
- I'll take one.
- That's the spirit.

13:31.068 --> 13:34.778
I wonder what your father Edgar
would say about all this, Evelyn.

I was afraid this was
never gonna happen again.

16:01.235 --> 16:03.402
Me too.

16:03.405 --> 16:06.055
But maybe you and me
are meant to be together.

16:06.057 --> 16:07.866
Maybe we're end game.

16:07.868 --> 16:09.055
Reggie...

16:15.416 --> 16:17.023
Hungry, Kevin?

16:17.026 --> 16:18.453
Here.

16:18.456 --> 16:21.570
It's an organic brownie with
farm-grown maple mushrooms baked in.

16:21.572 --> 16:22.922
- Oh!
- Try it.

16:22.924 --> 16:24.966
They're... transformative.

16:28.670 --> 16:30.124
Enjoy the ride.

16:30.127 --> 16:31.931
With a big gulp of water.

16:31.933 --> 16:33.308
Fountain's in the hall.

16:47.376 --> 16:49.990
_

17:01.404 --> 17:04.122
So last night was big fun.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.598
But...

17:05.602 --> 17:07.685
now it's time to dig deep.

17:07.689 --> 17:09.785
So, we're each gonna share something

17:09.787 --> 17:11.804
that we've never told anyone before.

17:11.806 --> 17:14.432
Big or small.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.853
So, does no one have a burden that
the rest of us can help shoulder?

17:20.410 --> 17:22.786
I'm being haunted by Midge's ghost.

17:22.789 --> 17:25.968
I've been thinking about her all the time
since rehearsals started and I just... I just

17:25.970 --> 17:28.265
- feel so guilty.
- I've been seeing her, too.

17:29.849 --> 17:33.246
Not her ghost. But in nightmares.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.187
How beautiful.

17:38.658 --> 17:42.201
Through revealing their
truth, these two young men have

17:42.203 --> 17:44.528
found an unexpected connection,

17:44.530 --> 17:46.085
perhaps more.

17:46.088 --> 17:47.382
So, um,

17:48.421 --> 17:49.825
who would like to go next?

17:49.827 --> 17:51.368
I've got something.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.703
I know

17:52.705 --> 17:54.788
it was just supposed
to be a summer fling,

17:54.790 --> 17:56.516
and, uh, she didn't want a relationship.

17:56.518 --> 17:59.710
But I did. So it really
blew to see Archie and Josie

17:59.712 --> 18:01.170
getting cozy last night.

18:01.172 --> 18:02.890
Arch,

18:02.893 --> 18:05.144
- are you and Josie dating?
- Well, I mean...

18:06.327 --> 18:07.652
Uh...

18:07.655 --> 18:09.839
- Did you know about this?
- What?

18:09.842 --> 18:11.655
No, I had no idea.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.608
The fact that your ex-boo
has a new girlfriend

18:14.611 --> 18:17.369
has nothing to do with you
suddenly being all-in with me?

18:17.372 --> 18:18.802
Veronica?

18:18.805 --> 18:20.164
Anything to share?

18:23.079 --> 18:25.673
I just found out that my
parents are separating.

18:27.162 --> 18:29.687
My family's unconventional,
to say the least,

18:29.690 --> 18:32.665
but I always thought,
no matter what, they'd

18:32.668 --> 18:33.928
stay together.

18:35.973 --> 18:39.934
And that is what we in the
theater call a breakthrough.

18:45.308 --> 18:47.016
So, I guess people know about us now.

18:47.018 --> 18:48.234
Yup.

18:48.236 --> 18:50.408
He's a real class-act, that Sweet Pea.

18:50.411 --> 18:52.219
Josie, is it such a bad thing?

18:52.222 --> 18:54.680
Why not make it official? Why
not be boyfriend and girlfriend?

18:54.683 --> 18:56.100
Archie...

18:56.103 --> 18:57.421
Okay.

18:59.814 --> 19:01.063
The other day,

19:01.065 --> 19:03.115
when you asked how we got together,

19:03.117 --> 19:04.121
we were lonely.

19:04.124 --> 19:05.917
It's not exactly a strong bedrock.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.486
That's what you think we are?

19:07.488 --> 19:09.488
Just lonely souls, filling the void?

19:15.204 --> 19:16.670
So that's the real reason.

19:16.672 --> 19:19.098
You wanted to get back together because

19:19.100 --> 19:20.600
your parents are splitsville.

19:22.086 --> 19:23.478
Why didn't you tell me?

19:23.480 --> 19:24.919
I wanted to ignore it.

19:26.849 --> 19:28.059
To feel better.

19:29.519 --> 19:31.132
You make me feel better.

19:33.097 --> 19:34.628
I know how it must seem.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.775
And I would understand if you
never wanted to talk to me again.

19:37.778 --> 19:39.356
That's not what I'm saying.

19:40.488 --> 19:43.478
And truly, it sucks about your folks,

19:44.840 --> 19:48.080
but I don't think this is something
we should be doing right now.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.918
What's your damage, Child of the Corn?

20:10.467 --> 20:13.667
I just thought you might want to
see what's happening in the hall.

20:18.608 --> 20:21.350
Um, did you have a
lobotomy for breakfast?

20:21.353 --> 20:23.353
You're wearing my signature color.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.832
You don't own the color red.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.357
Red existed before you.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.817
Not at Riverdale High.

20:28.819 --> 20:31.170
Here, I invented red.

20:31.172 --> 20:33.131
I am red.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.086
Sorry,

20:39.089 --> 20:42.156
but this school's not big enough
for both of us. faux-Pink Lady.

20:42.159 --> 20:44.027
And I was here first.

20:44.030 --> 20:46.745
So go to Centerville High.

20:46.748 --> 20:49.302
Or Westerberg. I don't care.

20:50.381 --> 20:52.932
But you have until first bell Monday

20:52.935 --> 20:56.930
to clear every trace of

Stop.

23:04.847 --> 23:06.233
I'm sorry.

23:06.235 --> 23:08.275
I shouldn't have brought you guys here.

23:09.394 --> 23:10.691
I can't do this.

23:15.230 --> 23:17.291
Sweet Pea and Fangs

your groups and grids.

23:19.156 --> 23:20.893
Scour the area, find the trailer.

23:20.896 --> 23:24.606
Now, if I'm right, it's being used as
a drug lab, and we need to shut it down.

23:24.609 --> 23:26.870
First sight of it,
you call me ASAP. Okay?

23:32.333 --> 23:34.210
Do you want to go

23:34.213 --> 23:36.856
I wish, but I heard from...

Hey.

25:27.710 --> 25:29.251
You got my text. You came.

25:29.254 --> 25:30.971
Um...

25:30.974 --> 25:32.304
I wanted to talk to you.

25:32.306 --> 25:33.420
Wait.

25:34.842 --> 25:36.073
Can I go first?

25:38.498 --> 25:40.504
Look, if you don't want
to be in a relationship

25:40.506 --> 25:42.464
because you're not into
me, then that's fine.

25:42.466 --> 25:44.799
But if you do like me...

25:44.801 --> 25:47.636
Then let's start
figuring out what we are,

25:47.638 --> 25:50.022
and what we can be to each other.

25:50.024 --> 25:51.218
For real,

25:51.221 --> 25:53.582
let's clean the slate
and let's fight for this.

27:42.907 --> 27:44.198
Principal Weatherbee,

27:44.201 --> 27:47.874
Heathers is being used to
indoctrinate students into a cult.

27:48.955 --> 27:51.517
It looks like these two
boys are simply rehearsing.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.753
No.

27:52.755 --> 27:56.773
No, no, this is part
of a religious ceremony.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.869
A ritual.

27:57.872 --> 28:00.768
The Farm's a fully
sanctioned club, Ms. Cooper.

28:00.771 --> 28:03.813
Approved by me, after I
read Edgar's doctrines.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.320
Which, I must say, I found quite

28:06.323 --> 28:08.069
fascinating

28:08.072 --> 28:09.446
and appealing.

28:10.836 --> 28:12.489
Jug, you'll never believe this,

28:12.491 --> 28:15.634
but I think Weatherbee
is part of the Farm.

28:15.636 --> 28:17.619
Yeah, well, I have news, too.

28:17.621 --> 28:19.876
Can you meet me at
Junkyard Steve's, ASAP?

28:25.313 --> 28:27.021
What is that, drain cleaner?

28:28.057 --> 28:29.315
No.

28:30.893 --> 28:32.539
It's an olive branch.

28:36.824 --> 28:38.774
So you're here to beg for clemency?

28:38.776 --> 28:40.246
No.

28:40.249 --> 28:41.749
For us.

28:41.752 --> 28:43.776
What are we doing?

28:43.779 --> 28:46.255
What are we even fighting about?

28:46.258 --> 28:50.965
Babe, what was love like in your family?

28:53.439 --> 28:54.873
It was

28:56.440 --> 28:57.853
all or nothing.

28:59.680 --> 29:03.661
Pure adoration or distilled hate.

29:03.664 --> 29:06.373
Thornhill was a den of shadows,

29:06.376 --> 29:08.187
and Jay-Jay was my only light.

29:09.673 --> 29:11.764
And

29:11.767 --> 29:14.217
he died,

29:14.220 --> 29:15.403
and it was dark again.

29:16.413 --> 29:17.696
Until you.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.518
Then it felt like you
were disappearing on me.

29:21.521 --> 29:23.136
But I'm not gone.

29:24.855 --> 29:26.081
I'm right here.

29:26.957 --> 29:29.322
And maybe

29:29.325 --> 29:31.707
it's not too late for us.

29:33.895 --> 29:35.417
Tonsils called it in.

29:38.886 --> 29:39.927
Oh, my God.

29:41.222 --> 29:42.741
This was my childhood home.

29:45.801 --> 29:47.101
My mom destroyed it.

29:55.552 --> 29:57.472
And how the hell did it get here?

29:59.620 --> 30:01.296
When did our lives go

30:01.299 --> 30:03.210
from worry about who was
going to sit net to us

30:03.213 --> 30:05.823
on the bus to drug lord mothers?

30:06.688 --> 30:08.872
And serial killer fathers.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.918
And unstoppable cults.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.495
This is the emotional
climax of the musical.

30:15.497 --> 30:19.647
"Seventeen" captures the longing all the
characters feel for what they've lost,

30:19.650 --> 30:21.791
their teen innocence.

30:29.151 --> 30:30.793
What are we gonna do?

33:11.669 --> 33:13.290
while everyone's at the play.

33:13.293 --> 33:16.186
Arch can lend me the keys to his
dad's truck, and I can just move it,

33:16.189 --> 33:17.429
get it out of my mom's hands.

33:18.592 --> 33:21.842
Is this idea maybe more
emotional than practical?

33:23.227 --> 33:25.547
Because another thing
that you could do is...

33:25.550 --> 33:26.518
What?

33:26.521 --> 33:27.784
You let it go.

33:32.948 --> 33:35.064
Come back home, Daddy.

33:35.067 --> 33:38.831
So what if Mom tried to
get rid of your drugs?

33:38.834 --> 33:41.460
Do you want to know the real
reason why we're getting a divorce?

33:44.632 --> 33:46.952
I found out that your mother
tried to have me killed.

33:49.685 --> 33:51.018
Twice.

33:52.972 --> 33:55.139
I... I can't believe that.

33:55.142 --> 33:56.499
Oh, mija,

33:56.501 --> 33:58.143
yes, you can.

33:58.145 --> 34:00.128
In fact,

34:00.130 --> 34:02.090
I think part of you already knew.

34:03.281 --> 34:04.752
You always say,

34:06.320 --> 34:09.846
"Family is the most important thing."

34:09.848 --> 34:11.031
Family's trust.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.580
You and your mother betrayed me, so...

34:15.549 --> 34:17.149
there is no family anymore.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.632
Veronica, your solo's up.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.703
I was going to talk about
the devastating loneliness

34:33.705 --> 34:35.770

this particular moment,

34:35.773 --> 34:39.183
