WHAT WAS IT?
IT WAS NOTHING.

LIKE NOTHING.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.499
SOMETHING
TO HELP SKYE.

36:50.499 --> 36:52.291
BECAUSE YOU
WANT TO CHANGE HER.

36:52.291 --> 36:53.462
IS THAT IT?

36:53.462 --> 36:55.464
STOP IT.
I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE SKYE.

36:55.464 --> 36:59.428

I'M JUST TRYING TO FIX HER.

THE RIGHT CALL.

IN PLAY RIGHT NOW

YOU BELIEVE HIM?

IT APPEARS
HUNTER ESCAPED

39:07.175 --> 39:09.017
USING ONE OF THE SHIP'S
SUBMERSIBLE PODS.

39:09.017 --> 39:11.099
WE'VE MANAGED
TO SCRAMBLE COMMUNICATIONS,

39:11.099 --> 39:13.101
BUT HE'S DISABLED
THE GPS.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.272
SO WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

39:14.272 --> 39:15.894
OR WHERE HE'S GOING.

39:15.894 --> 39:17.896
ONCE HE REACHES SHORE,
HE'S A FREE MAN,

ABLE TO COMMUNICATE
WITH WHOMEVER HE PLEASES.

39:20.278 --> 39:23.532
WE APPROXIMATE 12 HOURS
TILL HE REACHES THE COAST.

39:23.532 --> 39:25.654
WE MAY HAVE
A BIGGER PROBLEM.

SOME ASSET TO HIM.
