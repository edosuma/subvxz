Give me a break.

00:19.417 --> 00:22.534
What is that?
Like, 'no means no' or something?

00:22.577 --> 00:26.729
- Yes. Exactly. Come on.
- I did your calculus homework.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.849
So? Adam, seriously. No.

00:29.897 --> 00:34.095
- Oh, my God!

Maureen.

00:56.617 --> 00:58.573
Hi, Daddy.

01:02.177 --> 01:04.054
Where you been?

01:04.096 --> 01:06.930
- Out.
- Out? Where?

01:08.777 --> 01:12.008
- What have you been doing?
- Nothing.

01:12.057 --> 01:14.651
Nothing?
At 2:30 in the morning, nothing?

01:15.617 --> 01:17.926
- Dad, it's really...
- Breathe on me.

01:17.977 --> 01:20.013
- What?
- Breathe on me.

01:24.817 --> 01:27.285
- Who were you out with?
- Nobody.

01:28.937 --> 01:31.735
Out. Nothing. Nobody.
Those are your answers to me?

01:31.777 --> 01:33.768
- Uh-huh.
- Fine. You're busted.

01:33.817 --> 01:37.014
- You're grounded. Go to your room.
- For how long?

01:37.057 --> 01:40.413
Until I get answers or you turn 18,
whichever comes first.

01:40.457 --> 01:44.894
- Can we talk about it?
- No. They've called me in.

01:44.937 --> 01:46.655
Talk about typical.

01:47.857 --> 01:51.213
Go... to your room... now.

01:51.257 --> 01:54.852
- This isn't fair.
- I got news. Life isn't fair, honey.

01:56.737 --> 01:59.570
Detectives Benson and Stabler.
What happened?

01:59.617 --> 02:03.929
A young couple found
a girl's body about 1:50am. DOA.

02:03.977 --> 02:08.925
Over here. They called campus police
who called us. We went to you guys.

02:08.977 --> 02:11.969
- No underwear.
- Bad blow to the head.

02:12.017 --> 02:15.168
- Looks like cement around the wound.
- Yep.

02:15.217 --> 02:19.176
OK. Do you think
we're looking for a rock or a brick?

02:19.217 --> 02:21.173
Who's gonna look for that?

02:21.217 --> 02:25.130
- Me?
- Yes. Start here then spread out.

02:25.177 --> 02:28.931
Have campus security
halt all garbage pick-up.

02:28.977 --> 02:33.334
- You want us to go through trash?
- Yeah. You, personally.

02:33.377 --> 02:37.609
- Why's she all wet?
- I figured it was the sprinklers.

02:38.977 --> 02:42.014
- Forensics is gonna love that.
- Who found her?

02:42.057 --> 02:44.412
- These students.
- Get anything off 'em?

02:44.457 --> 02:45.731
No.

02:45.777 --> 02:47.290
Did you hear anything?

02:47.337 --> 02:50.454
- Nah. It was late.
- What were you doin' out here?

02:50.497 --> 02:53.933
- Trying to get some privacy.
- Hey, Elliot.

02:55.377 --> 02:59.131
Her name was Jeanne Gallagher.
She was a sophomore.

02:59.177 --> 03:01.168
Bowman? Baumann?

03:01.217 --> 03:03.685
Where's Bowman Hall?

03:06.857 --> 03:09.576
She was almost home.

03:57.457 --> 04:00.494
We could be lookin' at two attackers.

04:00.537 --> 04:05.486
Look at the way the legs are spread.
It reads like a single doer to me.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.732
This is rape.

04:07.777 --> 04:11.247
Somebody bashed her with a rock,
that's the cause of death?

04:11.297 --> 04:15.415
Preliminary.
We're still looking for the murder weapon.

04:15.457 --> 04:20.975
The only thing we have is that she
was drunk. Alcohol level was 0.27.

04:21.017 --> 04:22.973
Triple the limit.

04:23.017 --> 04:27.966
I used to yearn for a girl who drank
like that. Where was the booze from?

04:28.017 --> 04:31.976
- A party for their basketball team.
- One helluva party.

04:32.017 --> 04:35.373
The Rays are one of college
basketball's great comebacks.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.887
From joke of the division
to the Sweet Sixteen inside two years.

04:38.937 --> 04:43.089
- They bought their way up.
- Hey, come on! That's my school.

04:43.137 --> 04:45.287
Don't be cynical.

04:45.337 --> 04:49.330
They spend money like the Sultan
of Brunei at a hookers' convention.

04:49.377 --> 04:54.087
- They don't get paid.
- No. They just get cars, free trips

04:54.137 --> 04:57.925
and tickets to sell to alumni
for ten times what a scalper would.

04:57.977 --> 05:00.730
Fine. So they don't get paid.

05:00.777 --> 05:02.495
What's this?

05:02.537 --> 05:06.576
You guys got this worked out?
See how she spent her evenings.

05:06.617 --> 05:08.528
- Ready?
- Yeah.

05:08.577 --> 05:12.775
- I got severed-head guy in court.
- Stick it to him.

05:13.937 --> 05:16.895
Jeanne Gallagher was
a very promising student.

05:16.937 --> 05:19.576
Her death was a erm...

05:19.617 --> 05:23.132
terrible blow to the entire university.

05:23.177 --> 05:27.614
We're holding a campus-wide Mass
to celebrate her life.

05:27.657 --> 05:30.330
- Thoughtful.
- We shall miss her.

05:30.377 --> 05:31.856
How well did you know her?

05:31.897 --> 05:36.129
As an administrator, I never met her.
But she was well-loved by many.

05:36.177 --> 05:39.613
That's great, but we need to talk
to people that knew her.

05:39.657 --> 05:45.015
The university will be mounting
its own investigation into this and...

05:45.057 --> 05:49.812
a full report shall be sent
to you as soon as it's available.

05:49.857 --> 05:54.612
Well, I'm sure that will be
very effective... Father.

05:54.657 --> 05:57.330
We know the victim was extremely drunk.

05:57.377 --> 06:00.494
Alcohol-counselling seminars

06:00.537 --> 06:03.847
will be part of my recommendation.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.457
That's not the point. Who was there?

06:06.497 --> 06:09.250
Talk to the hostess committee.
They planned it.

06:09.297 --> 06:11.253
Hostess committee?

06:11.297 --> 06:15.893
A sort of women's auxiliary
to support the basketball team.

06:15.937 --> 06:20.806
Er, very motivated campus women,
er, pitch in when necessary.

06:22.097 --> 06:25.646
The hostesses have been a
St Raymond's institution for 50 years.

06:25.697 --> 06:30.532
They provide tutoring, logistics,
even ironing the players' shirts.

06:30.577 --> 06:32.135
Or throwing big parties.

06:32.177 --> 06:35.931
They work hard. They need relaxation too.

06:35.977 --> 06:38.571
- And Jeanne?
- She was a hostess.

06:38.617 --> 06:42.292
That's what Father McCourt said.
Who was at this party?

06:42.337 --> 06:44.646
Players, prospective players,

06:44.697 --> 06:48.133
coaches, hostesses and important alumni.

06:48.177 --> 06:52.250
- Did you see Jeanne?
- She came early and helped set up.

06:52.297 --> 06:56.085
- Do you notice what time she left?
- I left before the party was over.

06:56.137 --> 06:58.697
Her room-mate, Shelley Brown,
might know.

07:01.137 --> 07:02.968
Make yourself at home.

07:03.017 --> 07:05.087
Riley, these are Detectives...

07:05.137 --> 07:07.890
Munch and Cassidy.
Were you at the party last night?

07:07.937 --> 07:09.814
Of course.

07:09.857 --> 07:11.529
What?

07:11.577 --> 07:13.772
You weren't drinking, were you?

07:13.817 --> 07:17.856
- What do you care?
- You got kind of a reputation.

07:17.897 --> 07:21.970
You slam back brews
like you slam down hoops.

07:22.017 --> 07:24.212
It's off-season.

07:24.257 --> 07:27.693
The drug test doesn't test for beer, does it?

07:27.737 --> 07:30.251
You don't know me.

07:30.297 --> 07:34.449
I know you're an elbow-thrower like
Lambier without the post-up moves.

07:34.497 --> 07:37.807
Look at our record
before you start taking pot shots.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.927
- You see Jeanne last night?
- Yeah.

07:39.977 --> 07:42.855
- When did she leave?
- Me and some friends left early.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.649
Some friends and I.

07:44.697 --> 07:49.452
Whatever. We went to this alumni
dude's house and met the mayor.

07:49.497 --> 07:51.772
We'll ask him about that.

07:51.817 --> 07:54.615
And alumni is plural, college man.

07:54.657 --> 07:57.535
- Anyone have a grudge with Jeanne?
- Yeah, maybe.

07:57.577 --> 08:00.694
- Chuck Mosley was yelling at her.
- Riley, he's a team-mate.

08:00.737 --> 08:03.615
We're not asking you.
What were they arguing about?

08:03.657 --> 08:08.811
I didn't hear but ask anyone.
She was cryin', he was all yellin'.

08:08.857 --> 08:12.532
- You know the way those people get.
- The way what people get?

08:12.577 --> 08:14.647
Street players.

08:14.697 --> 08:17.928
'Don't you mess with my homies,'
and all that gangsta rap crap,

08:17.977 --> 08:21.811
thinking they can get away with
anything because they're so bad.

08:21.857 --> 08:25.611
Unlike white boys who get away with it
because of Daddy's money?

08:26.897 --> 08:29.730
- Yeah.
- Where can we find Chuck Mosley?

08:29.777 --> 08:32.530
At 5th Avenue
and 100-and-something street.

08:32.577 --> 08:36.251
You know, you just look for
dealers and graffiti. He'll be there.

08:37.297 --> 08:38.446
Yeah!

09:05.497 --> 09:07.692
Mosley!

09:13.297 --> 09:16.369
Chuck Mosley!

09:17.737 --> 09:21.332
That'll get their attention.

09:21.377 --> 09:24.653
Check it out. It's the Blues Brothers.

09:24.697 --> 09:28.406
Actually,
we're Detectives Munch and Cassidy.

09:28.457 --> 09:31.210
You need to talk to them.
They got next.

09:31.257 --> 09:36.411
- We're not here to play, handsome.
- No? Well, you're on the court.

09:36.457 --> 09:39.608
Chuck... May I call you Chuck?

09:39.657 --> 09:42.125
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.970
Call my agent. I'm workin'.

09:47.017 --> 09:51.010
Yo! It's about the murder
of Jeanne Gallagher.

09:52.097 --> 09:55.612
So, when a white woman is killed
you round up the black men first,

09:55.657 --> 09:58.615
or do you ask a few white people
for appearances?

09:58.657 --> 10:00.852
- What was that?
- Chuck, come here.

10:00.897 --> 10:05.925
I know you gotta trifle with us
in front of your people to save face.

10:05.977 --> 10:09.526
I'll give you a choice. Either come with us,

10:09.577 --> 10:13.695
or get cuffed to that fence
and wait for a wagon to come.

10:19.617 --> 10:23.326
Wait. Jeanne and I were friends.
We went to the party together.

10:23.377 --> 10:25.971
- What time?
- After practice. Eight, nine.

10:26.017 --> 10:28.815
- Why were you arguing?
- She was on a tear.

10:28.857 --> 10:32.930
She's a sweet girl usually,
but with drink she gets in trouble.

10:32.977 --> 10:36.526
That's not an argument. That's an opinion.
An argument is yelling.

10:36.577 --> 10:39.535
- I wanted her to leave with me.
- Did she?

10:39.577 --> 10:42.933
- No. I gave her what-for and I left.
- What time?

10:42.977 --> 10:47.687
1:30. Conan O'Brien was on when
I got home. My mom was waiting.

10:47.737 --> 10:51.696
Your mom's your alibi?
That's beautiful. What's her number?

10:51.737 --> 10:55.252
My aunt's sick in Louisiana.
She went there to visit.

10:55.297 --> 10:57.731
- Which hospital?
- I don't know.

10:57.777 --> 11:00.245
- When is she back?
- I don't know.

11:00.297 --> 11:03.255
- Wrong answer.
- She's on a bus.

11:03.297 --> 11:05.367
Mosley's on ice till his alibi sticks.

11:05.417 --> 11:07.931
Kuger's a bigger punk off the court
than he is on.

11:07.977 --> 11:12.175
Unfortunately he has an alibi.
He was at a party with the mayor.

11:12.217 --> 11:15.846
I spoke to His Honour this morning.
He answered his own phone.

11:15.897 --> 11:18.695
- Reassuring.
- I woke him up, as a matter of fact.

11:18.737 --> 11:23.049
- What about Mosley?
- He admitted to arguing with Jeanne.

11:23.097 --> 11:26.726
- Alibi?
- He was watching TV with his mom.

11:26.777 --> 11:29.769
She is conveniently
on a bus trip to Louisiana.

11:29.817 --> 11:34.368
Do you think the great St Raymond
University machine is blocking us?

11:34.417 --> 11:37.056
- Why? Jeanne was their student.
- Money.

11:37.097 --> 11:42.490
Our suspects are basketball players.
We put away a couple of the stars...

11:42.537 --> 11:45.005
And they're out 40 million dollars.

11:45.057 --> 11:47.935
And they send me fund-raising letters.

11:47.977 --> 11:52.175
Eight million dollars in TV fees,
then they get money from alumni,

11:52.217 --> 11:55.334
- tickets and merchandising...
- Hats, T-shirts...

11:55.377 --> 11:57.527
Pen holders, plastic saints...

11:57.577 --> 12:02.253
It used to be the Georgetown Hoyas.
Now it's the Yukon Huskies.

12:02.297 --> 12:06.449
- St Raymond's would like that.
- You can remind them that,

12:06.497 --> 12:10.331
whatever perks their players get,
we make arrests without considering

12:10.377 --> 12:15.815
- a player's free-throw percentages.
- We'll do a pick and roll today.

12:15.857 --> 12:20.487
The room-mate may not have
a percentage in St Raymond's TV rights.

12:23.337 --> 12:25.214
What else do you get?

12:25.257 --> 12:29.250
Tickets, cars, trips to all
out-of-town games. You name it.

12:29.297 --> 12:32.175
A lot of perks for cheerleading.

12:32.217 --> 12:35.766
I wouldn't have quit if that was all it was.

12:35.817 --> 12:37.808
Well, what do they expect from you?

12:37.857 --> 12:41.566
Competition to recruit top players
from high schools is fierce.

12:41.617 --> 12:45.292
The NCAA's been cracking down
on the more obvious money incentives.

12:45.337 --> 12:49.250
Tickets, cars, the likes.
And hostesses offer...?

12:49.297 --> 12:53.290
Hospitality.
The university never explicitly demands

12:53.337 --> 12:55.931
that you show players a good time...

12:55.977 --> 12:58.411
But if you don't, you don't get the goodies?

12:58.457 --> 13:03.531
Yes. I quit. Jeanne needed the money
and the scholarship.

13:03.577 --> 13:05.169
What else can you tell us?

13:05.217 --> 13:10.450
We were close. She stuck by me
even though I quit the hostess crap.

13:10.497 --> 13:12.408
She let me go on living here with her.

13:12.457 --> 13:16.655
- She have a boyfriend?
- Brother. It's not allowed.

13:16.697 --> 13:20.326
One of the unwritten rules.
Hostesses must always be available.

13:20.377 --> 13:24.848
What was her state of mind
the last week or so?

13:24.897 --> 13:27.934
- Drunk.
- Was Jeanne always a heavy drinker?

13:27.977 --> 13:32.573
No. That's what's so weird.
At one point she never drank. But then...

13:32.617 --> 13:34.687
When did she start?

13:34.737 --> 13:39.936
After we got into the Sweet Sixteen,
there were, like, three days of celebrations.

13:40.777 --> 13:43.575
After that she kinda lost her spark.

13:43.617 --> 13:45.926
That's when she started drinking.

13:45.977 --> 13:48.969
- What happened to her?
- I don't know.

13:49.017 --> 13:51.406
I just know that's when she changed.

13:53.097 --> 13:57.409
Her parents might know. She moved in
with them for a while after that.

13:57.457 --> 14:02.451
Jeanne's room-mate said she changed
at the end of the season.

14:02.497 --> 14:07.252
Shelley said she went into
a kind of depression. Drinking a lot.

14:08.497 --> 14:10.488
Do you know why she changed?

14:12.857 --> 14:14.927
Stress.

14:17.177 --> 14:19.452
Mrs Gallagher,

14:19.497 --> 14:21.647
we need to know.

14:27.777 --> 14:29.768
Our girl was raped.

14:30.777 --> 14:32.768
That's what happened to her.

14:38.097 --> 14:42.090
Doctor-patient confidentiality
is the cornerstone of my practice.

14:42.137 --> 14:44.128
Students know they can trust me.

14:44.177 --> 14:47.374
Doctor, I hear you,
but this is a rape-homicide case.

14:47.417 --> 14:51.126
Doctor, telling us about
your conversations with Jeanne

14:51.177 --> 14:53.611
is the best thing you can do for her.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.926
I don't know who raped Jeanne.
She never told me.

15:00.977 --> 15:03.696
Did she know her attacker
or was it a stranger?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.410
She told me it was a basketball player.

15:06.457 --> 15:08.448
Did she give any specifics?

15:08.497 --> 15:10.488
No. She never gave a name.

15:10.537 --> 15:13.529
Did she say if he was black or white?

15:13.577 --> 15:17.570
I don't know. She was consciously vague.
I didn't like to push her.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.608
Dr Goodnall, he raped her.

15:19.657 --> 15:22.774
He committed a felony.
The man should be in jail.

15:22.817 --> 15:27.732
Look, three weeks after the rape,
Jeanne didn't have her period.

15:27.777 --> 15:31.770
Here's a girl as happy as a lark,
and then she's facing an abortion.

15:31.817 --> 15:35.856
Her parents were in denial.
She has nightmares, starts drinking.

15:35.897 --> 15:38.331
I had my hands full, Detective.

15:44.497 --> 15:46.692
Hey! I'm at eleven in a row here!

15:46.737 --> 15:48.728
Bill Bradley used to do that.

15:48.777 --> 15:50.972
Yeah, I read the McPhee book.

15:51.017 --> 15:54.407
As hard as he trained,
I thought I'd train harder.

15:54.457 --> 15:59.292
That's great, Chuck. We're more interested
in hearing about Jeanne Gallagher.

15:59.337 --> 16:01.567
I told you already. We had words.

16:01.617 --> 16:05.053
She was raped by a player
two months ago after a post-season party.

16:05.097 --> 16:10.171
That was one hell of an ugly party.
It was before we knew each other.

16:10.217 --> 16:14.051
You sure that's not what you
were arguing about the other night?

16:14.097 --> 16:15.086
Yes.

16:15.137 --> 16:19.335
Wasn't it, 'You drop a dime on me
and I'll kill you, yo'?

16:19.377 --> 16:22.289
Where does he get this stuff?

16:22.337 --> 16:24.328
He's got a fertile imagination.

16:24.377 --> 16:27.574
- You both studied French Literature?
- Yeah. Why?

16:27.617 --> 16:32.008
Well, communications,
basics of broadcasting...

16:32.057 --> 16:34.491
But... Rimbaud?

16:34.537 --> 16:36.528
Sure.

16:36.577 --> 16:40.968
I know that First Blood
speaks to the existential angst

16:41.017 --> 16:45.010
of being jerked around
by forces beyond your control.

16:48.977 --> 16:51.013
What?

16:53.857 --> 16:55.848
What did he say?

16:55.897 --> 16:58.855
What a wonderful job
he thinks the police do.

16:58.897 --> 17:00.888
He's not our doer.

17:04.497 --> 17:08.046
In three years Mosley
will have a shoe named after him.

17:08.097 --> 17:10.611
The highest honour in this society.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.647
What about his work in class?

17:12.696 --> 17:17.406
The last two books I needed,
Mosley had checked them out.

17:17.457 --> 17:21.369
All the more exemplary,
in comparison to your typical player,

17:21.416 --> 17:26.695
who expects to be entered as GPA
and have the fancy car and money deal.

17:26.737 --> 17:29.251
What relationship did he and Jeanne have?

17:29.297 --> 17:32.812
I don't know that they had one, of any kind.

17:32.857 --> 17:37.647
Any basketball players in your class
who weren't quite so exemplary?

17:37.697 --> 17:42.168
You mean someone white,
smug, stupid, drunk half the time,

17:42.217 --> 17:44.890
a selfish player on and off the court?

17:44.937 --> 17:47.929
Someone like Riley Kuger, you mean?

17:50.737 --> 17:54.935
Riley, you got away with one before.
Do you wanna give us your side?

17:54.977 --> 17:57.172
If I knew what you meant, I might.

17:57.217 --> 17:59.208
How about Jeanne Gallagher's rape?

17:59.257 --> 18:01.248
I did not rape her.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.686
Let's talk about Wednesday night.

18:03.737 --> 18:06.126
- Remember that far back?
- Yeah.

18:07.137 --> 18:11.335
That thing that happened to her
was terrible but I didn't do it.

18:11.377 --> 18:13.971
A 't.ing' didn't happen to her, Riley.

18:14.017 --> 18:17.646
Someone dragged her into the bushes,
raped her and bashed her head in.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.688
Those are actions.

18:19.737 --> 18:23.446
- You think I raped Jeanne?
- You bet we do.

18:23.497 --> 18:25.886
- I've got an alibi.
- What?

18:25.937 --> 18:29.247
The campus police picked me up
that night, drunk.

18:29.297 --> 18:32.334
They took me to their offices.
I slept there all night.

18:34.497 --> 18:37.057
- More bad news.
- Let's hear.

18:37.097 --> 18:40.692
Riley Kuger supposedly raped
Jeanne Gallagher two months ago.

18:40.737 --> 18:43.012
It wasn't reported but everyone knows.

18:43.057 --> 18:45.935
So use the rape
to pin the murder on Kuger.

18:45.977 --> 18:51.529
Except he says he was in the custody
of campus police the night in question.

18:51.577 --> 18:54.091
Security obstructed the investigation?

18:54.137 --> 18:56.332
He offered an alibi before we asked.

18:56.377 --> 19:02.009
When I was at St Rays
the word dunk hadn't been invented.

19:02.057 --> 19:06.653
If it had, there wasn't one player
could touch the rim without ladders.

19:06.697 --> 19:10.087
- Well, times have changed.
- Not that much.

19:10.137 --> 19:12.526
When the dean of science
bought a Mustang,

19:12.577 --> 19:15.887
the hottest car in the world,
in the fall of '64,

19:15.937 --> 19:19.407
some fool got smashed
and took it for a spin.

19:19.457 --> 19:21.368
The dean's new car?

19:21.417 --> 19:26.969
Lost control on an icy road, hit another car
and broke the other driver's leg.

19:27.017 --> 19:29.406
DUI, reckless endangerment and...

19:29.457 --> 19:33.086
Campus police decided
the kid deserved another chance.

19:33.137 --> 19:35.446
'Youthful indiscretions,' they said.

19:36.257 --> 19:38.407
And that fool was you?

19:39.697 --> 19:42.370
I was the schmo with the broken leg.

19:42.417 --> 19:45.215
The driver was
a jerk named Anthony Shlosser.

19:45.257 --> 19:47.248
He's a lackey in the mayor's office.

19:47.297 --> 19:51.495
I would still like to ring his neck,
plus take a shot at campus security.

19:54.697 --> 19:58.690
Riley Kuger said he was here
the night Jeanne Gallagher was raped.

19:58.737 --> 20:00.216
- It's there.
- Yep.

20:00.257 --> 20:03.249
The one in different ink
and different handwriting.

20:05.297 --> 20:07.492
Where'd you get the blue star?

20:07.537 --> 20:10.927
I headed a charity to build a decent gym.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.366
The cut the ribbon my 19th year on the beat.

20:14.137 --> 20:17.846
You wanna throw that in the garbage
with an accessory charge, do ya?

20:17.897 --> 20:20.889
That'd be a hell of a way
to ruin a good career.

20:20.937 --> 20:23.735
- Off the record?
- You know better than that.

20:25.617 --> 20:28.814
Kuger said the girl was mad at him.
They'd broke up.

20:28.857 --> 20:30.848
And? What?

20:30.897 --> 20:33.491
He told us she was good
at using the system,

20:33.537 --> 20:36.688
even though it was your basic
'He said... She said...'

20:36.737 --> 20:38.728
So you covered his ass.

20:38.777 --> 20:41.575
A girl with a grudge
can destroy a man

20:41.617 --> 20:44.529
whether he did something or not.
I've seen it happen.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.694
We are way past, 'He said... She said...'

20:47.737 --> 20:50.046
We are now looking at rape-murder!

20:53.057 --> 20:55.048
He wasn't here.

20:55.097 --> 20:56.894
It was a mistake.

20:57.897 --> 20:59.888
I'm sorry.

21:00.897 --> 21:02.888
You should be.

21:04.217 --> 21:06.173
- Salad!
- Good job.

21:06.217 --> 21:09.687
- I could eat a whole steak.
- You could eat a whole steak?

21:09.737 --> 21:12.410
I could eat a whole cow right now.

21:15.137 --> 21:17.014
Hello, Daddy.

21:17.057 --> 21:20.288
- I didn't think you were here.
- Why are you out of your room?

21:20.337 --> 21:22.805
- Dad, I've been up there for days.
- I can count.

21:22.857 --> 21:25.530
- Ready to talk?
- There's nothing to talk about.

21:27.617 --> 21:29.608
Fine. Back to your cell.

21:31.817 --> 21:33.648
I can't believe this.

21:33.697 --> 21:38.088
I can't believe you tried
to sneak out and back in at 2:30am.

21:39.097 --> 21:42.373
- Think you're handling this right?
- Yeah. I do.

21:42.417 --> 21:45.409
- Well, I don't.
- OK. What have you got?

21:45.457 --> 21:48.290
Suppose my parents
had dealt with me like that.

21:49.097 --> 21:51.088
We wouldn't have had Maureen.

21:54.217 --> 21:55.935
Hey!

21:57.897 --> 21:59.888
Excuse me. I'm busy.

21:59.937 --> 22:03.247
- Where are you on Jeanne Gallagher?
- I'm getting to it.

22:03.297 --> 22:05.765
All we need is the DNA testing back.

22:05.817 --> 22:07.808
Half my staff is out with flu.

22:07.857 --> 22:11.975
I prepped the semen sample
personally but PCR takes a week.

22:12.017 --> 22:14.008
The Gallagher girl?

22:14.057 --> 22:16.651
I took a gander in the electron microscope.

22:16.697 --> 22:19.165
Your doer's sperm count is way, way low.

22:19.217 --> 22:22.129
- Beautiful. That's something.
- How soon can we have it?

22:22.177 --> 22:25.089
Within an hour of getting
a suspect sample to compare.

22:25.137 --> 22:28.334
Shouldn't be difficult
from a couple of horny students.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.009
- Thanks.
- Thanks. See ya.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.612
What you're asking of my students
is considered a venial sin.

22:34.657 --> 22:39.048
Is confession still on Saturday,
cos I think they'll be out in time.

22:39.097 --> 22:41.770
I object to your flippancy, Captain.

22:41.817 --> 22:45.696
The police must set the highest
moral standards for young people.

22:45.737 --> 22:49.571
That'd be great, Reverend,
but we have to solve crimes.

22:49.617 --> 22:51.972
They're in here.

22:54.977 --> 22:56.968
Do as they ask.

22:57.017 --> 22:58.814
Let's get'em done.

22:58.857 --> 23:03.169
When you've produced the sample,
wipe any excess spillage...

23:03.217 --> 23:06.209
- I can't do this!
...and seal the lid.

23:06.257 --> 23:09.533
Have a fight with your right hand?
Sure you can.

23:09.577 --> 23:11.374
Let's go.

23:13.577 --> 23:17.650
If you want to refuse,
brother Mosley, I'll stand with you.

23:25.497 --> 23:28.295
- I can talk to you, right? No BS.
- I'm all ears.

23:28.337 --> 23:30.134
Jeanne and I made love.

23:30.177 --> 23:32.771
You were seen arguing.
Was that foreplay?

23:32.817 --> 23:34.614
We argued later. Much later.

23:34.657 --> 23:36.648
When did you make love?

23:36.697 --> 23:38.892
Early. Before the party started.

23:39.897 --> 23:43.890
We were just hangin' out.
Then she kisses me. It's nice.

23:44.897 --> 23:46.694
She takes my hand...

23:46.737 --> 23:50.093
You're giving me a heads up
that you'll ID positive?

23:50.137 --> 23:52.128
That's just it. I'm not.

23:52.937 --> 23:55.531
- Why?
- We used a condom.

24:00.897 --> 24:04.446
I hope Mr Ward won't be late
for his own sentencing.

24:05.457 --> 24:08.529
The defendant was killed while in custody,

24:08.577 --> 24:10.807
in the same manner as his victim.

24:10.857 --> 24:14.850
Then, this case is adjourned

24:15.857 --> 24:17.973
because it is unnecessary.

24:18.017 --> 24:19.814
Next case.

24:19.857 --> 24:22.974
Hey, can I ask your advice
on a tough one?

24:23.017 --> 24:26.692
- What, the campus murder?
- Yeah. Same vic, different crime.

24:26.737 --> 24:29.729
It was a date rape.
Some jerk on the basketball team.

24:29.777 --> 24:32.245
The problem is, the girl's dead.

24:32.297 --> 24:36.290
The rape was two-months old
so any physical evidence is long gone.

24:36.337 --> 24:38.328
- That makes it tough.
- Yeah.

24:38.377 --> 24:42.768
Without evidence is there any other
way to bring charges against him?

24:42.817 --> 24:47.607
If anyone knows, the grand jury
will give us an 805 hearsay exception.

24:47.657 --> 24:50.455
I mean, provided the person
is credible enough.

24:50.497 --> 24:54.285
How about a decorated ex-cop?
Is that credible enough for you?

24:55.297 --> 24:57.606
Make him a reservation at Rikers.

24:59.857 --> 25:02.849
- This place brings back memories.
- You didn't go here.

25:02.897 --> 25:07.015
I didn't go anywhere
but it reminds me how badly I wanted to.

25:07.057 --> 25:09.525
- You went to Queen's College!
- I commuted.

25:09.577 --> 25:12.375
A new wife, a new kid.
I took classes at night.

25:12.417 --> 25:14.977
I always wanted to live in the dorm.

25:15.017 --> 25:17.008
- I even knew where.
- Where?

25:17.057 --> 25:18.456
- Ready?
- Yeah.

25:18.497 --> 25:20.886
- Everglades University.
- Everglades?

25:20.937 --> 25:24.247
Playboy rated universities
by their sexual temperature.

25:24.297 --> 25:26.288
EU. Always top of the list.

25:26.337 --> 25:29.170
- I see you had your priorities.
- Thanks.

25:30.217 --> 25:33.209
Who was in class
the day after Jeanne's murder?

25:33.257 --> 25:36.613
I don't take attendance.
Who are you looking for?

25:36.657 --> 25:38.966
Can you take a guess?

25:39.017 --> 25:42.293
If you name some names,
I can tell you if they were there.

25:42.337 --> 25:44.646
Chuck Mosley.

25:44.697 --> 25:48.133
He was there. Chuck's not in trouble, is he?

25:48.177 --> 25:50.611
Did you talk with him?

25:51.897 --> 25:54.365
Now that you mention it,

25:54.417 --> 25:56.408
he seemed distracted.

25:56.457 --> 25:58.766
As if he had a lot on his mind.

25:58.817 --> 26:01.012
It was a day of tragedy.

26:01.057 --> 26:03.855
Most people looked pale, distracted.

26:05.697 --> 26:09.485
But I don't remember him
making one comment that morning.

26:09.537 --> 26:12.051
Was that odd for Chuck?

26:12.097 --> 26:16.648
Very odd. I just wrote it off
as a hangover at the time.

26:17.457 --> 26:19.334
Is that helpful?

26:20.297 --> 26:22.288
Very helpful, Professor.

26:22.337 --> 26:25.056
Thank you.
We're gonna be in touch with you.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.690
The first time we spoke to him,
Chuck was an angel.

26:28.737 --> 26:31.012
Now he's a hung-over slacker.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.730
He doesn't remember
anybody in class till now.

26:33.777 --> 26:37.167
Suddenly he remembers specifics.
What d'you think his angle is?

26:37.217 --> 26:39.685
He's covering up for something.

26:39.737 --> 26:42.297
The guy feeds us what we want to hear.

26:43.897 --> 26:47.890
Which version of Chuck do you believe?
Star student or slacker?

26:47.937 --> 26:52.374
Let's see what the suspect's sperm count is.
We'll have a better idea.

26:52.417 --> 26:57.093
We got two healthy boys. Kuger
and Mosley's swimmers are shipshape.

26:57.137 --> 27:00.095
- No kidding?
- Remember when, John?

27:00.137 --> 27:03.652
- I could say the same to you.
- So are they free to go?

27:03.697 --> 27:06.894
- We got no reason to hold Kuger.
- Mosley?

27:06.937 --> 27:10.088
He wasn't straight with us about Jeanne.

27:10.137 --> 27:15.165
Until we can confirm his alibi
about where he was, I say we keep him.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.095
His mother is on the way in.

27:21.377 --> 27:25.290
He was home by one. He had to be.
He had an early class.

27:25.337 --> 27:27.805
- Does he have a curfew?
- Yes.

27:27.857 --> 27:31.566
I have always insisted
that academics come first.

27:31.617 --> 27:36.611
Only when his work is done
can he do extracurricular activities.

27:36.657 --> 27:41.287
You consider big-time college
basketball extracurricular?

27:41.337 --> 27:43.771
Are you serious?

27:43.817 --> 27:49.255
My son has the potential to be
much more than a basketball player.

27:49.297 --> 27:52.095
He is one of the best in the country.

27:52.137 --> 27:56.927
As a pro he'd make more money
in a week than everybody here combined.

28:06.257 --> 28:10.375
Nothing we could do to Mosley could
compare to the wrath of this woman.

28:10.417 --> 28:12.851
We got no sperm.

28:12.897 --> 28:15.775
His alibi's good. Let him go.

28:21.977 --> 28:26.095
Rousseau's class
started as a seminar on French Lit.

28:26.137 --> 28:30.574
Les Mis for all. A few weeks in,
Rousseau's eyeing Jeanne.

28:30.617 --> 28:34.974
- Eyeing how?
- All moony. She didn't like it.

28:35.017 --> 28:38.168
- Did she tell him?
- What? 'Don't look at me'?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.766
He wasn't leering.
There's no law against looking, is there?

28:41.817 --> 28:44.775
- There is against stalking.
- I know.

28:44.817 --> 28:49.129
He was always in the library
or bookstore when she was.

28:49.177 --> 28:52.328
- He'd claim he was an avid reader.
- Exactly.

28:52.377 --> 28:57.610
He's a tenured professor.
They have to kill somebody to lose their job.

28:57.657 --> 29:02.685
It often comes down to the student's
word against the professor's.

29:02.737 --> 29:06.173
Miss Gallagher's not speaking much
these days.

29:06.217 --> 29:13.009
I have talked with Henri and we've agreed
he'll modify his behaviour accordingly.

29:13.057 --> 29:15.651
- In our world...
- In our world, Father,

29:15.697 --> 29:19.167
behaviour modification means prison time.

29:19.217 --> 29:22.493
- For unwanted attention? Please.
- Again, sir.

29:22.537 --> 29:26.212
We call it stalking. Legally, harassment too.

29:26.257 --> 29:30.091
If we find priors,
it's menacing in the first degree.

29:30.137 --> 29:34.688
Menace, hm?
That's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?

29:34.737 --> 29:39.492
No, Father. It's in the eye
of the district attorney.

29:48.817 --> 29:52.651
And then in 1976,
Rousseau was accused of forcing himself

29:52.697 --> 29:56.372
on a girl during a bicentennial tequila bash.

29:56.417 --> 29:59.489
She passed out and awoke
in his frat house

29:59.537 --> 30:02.973
on the receiving end of a forceable oral cop.

30:03.017 --> 30:06.851
- And?
- The girl was given cab fare.

30:06.897 --> 30:10.731
Rousseau's fraternity
became known as 'I ate a pi'.

30:10.777 --> 30:13.450
St Raymond's took him on
as a teaching assistant

30:13.497 --> 30:17.012
and since then he's racked up
quite a string of maybes.

30:17.057 --> 30:21.016
It's a time line in the history
of sex-crime legislation.

30:21.057 --> 30:25.847
What did they call it before
date rape and sexual harassment?

30:25.897 --> 30:28.570
Boys will be boys?

30:28.617 --> 30:31.495
- Any arrests?
- Just say the magic word.

30:31.537 --> 30:35.576
- I need physical evidence.
- Well, re-canvass the crime scene.

30:35.617 --> 30:39.576
Do that.
Meanwhile search his home and office.

30:39.617 --> 30:42.529
I think I'm falling in love with you, Abby.

30:46.497 --> 30:48.886
Maureen.

30:48.937 --> 30:51.087
Wait a minute.

30:53.217 --> 30:55.731
What?

30:55.777 --> 30:59.736
- I don't know. Whatever.
- Whatever? Is that an apology?

30:59.777 --> 31:02.416
I'm not apologising.

31:02.457 --> 31:07.929
But I won't stand here and have
a cold war with someone that I love.

31:07.977 --> 31:10.935
Daddy, I didn't do anything. I promise.

31:10.977 --> 31:14.492
I believe you. You're innocent. But you lied.

31:14.537 --> 31:17.688
- I was just afraid.
- So am I.

31:17.737 --> 31:21.696
Don't you understand? You're innocent
but I see the world day in, day out.

31:21.737 --> 31:24.570
You sneak out during the night

31:24.617 --> 31:28.371
and I end up picking up
your body parts in Jersey.

31:28.417 --> 31:30.885
- Daddy!
- Come here.

31:33.857 --> 31:36.325
Daddy, I'm sorry.

31:38.737 --> 31:41.046
Me too.

31:45.457 --> 31:48.529
- Hey. I love you.
- I love you too.

31:48.577 --> 31:50.613
Yeah.

31:54.697 --> 31:58.087
Can't people take a breather
before they let the healing begin?

31:58.137 --> 32:02.972
'Enrolled in God's college now.'
'We love you, Jeanne.' Please!

32:03.017 --> 32:07.488
- Come on, it's spontaneous emotion.
- The spot I die on,

32:07.537 --> 32:11.086
be sure this never happens to it
or I'll haunt you.

32:11.137 --> 32:14.254
Noted.
OK, so, where's Rousseau's office.

32:14.297 --> 32:16.413
That way.

32:16.457 --> 32:20.211
- But he walked this way every day.
- Familiarity.

32:20.257 --> 32:23.454
We got reddish fragments in the wound?

32:23.497 --> 32:27.695
They never found the murder weapon.
The rock, or brick, or whatever.

32:29.537 --> 32:32.256
Maybe it's a building.

32:33.137 --> 32:35.810
- A building?
- He pushes her around.

32:35.857 --> 32:38.769
- Victim or attacker?
- Attacker.

32:38.817 --> 32:41.570
He bashes her head into the wall?

32:41.617 --> 32:46.896
Oh, no. You meant he hit her
over the head with the building. Gotcha.

32:46.937 --> 32:51.453
Except the body was found over there
and we got no drag marks.

32:51.497 --> 32:54.933
Forensics went over that area, but that's it.

32:54.977 --> 32:57.286
Wait up.

32:57.337 --> 32:59.805
- These stairs.
- Yeah.

32:59.857 --> 33:02.007
What if...?

33:02.057 --> 33:06.733
What if he pushed her?
What if he pushes her down the stairs?

33:06.777 --> 33:10.975
This whole time we've been
assuming that the rock hit her.

33:11.817 --> 33:14.536
Maybe she hit the rock.

33:15.497 --> 33:21.493
Any notes he sent to Jeanne
that weren't about structure or theme?

33:21.537 --> 33:24.290
I handle the papers and the grading.

33:24.337 --> 33:27.295
Any conferences scheduled
after office hours?

33:27.337 --> 33:30.295
- He keeps his own schedule.
- Becky. Listen.

33:30.337 --> 33:33.727
We won't bust you.
All teachers have favourites.

33:33.777 --> 33:38.134
But if you don't help us,
there will be another Jeanne Gallagher.

33:38.177 --> 33:41.806
- That's his schedule.
- Yes, it is.

33:41.857 --> 33:45.293
The 29th. 'Political Science at 10:20.'

33:45.337 --> 33:48.249
'165th to reservoir.' What's that mean?

33:48.297 --> 33:51.494
- That's a jogging path.
- He a jogger?

33:52.497 --> 33:55.136
Why is he in Political Science?

33:55.177 --> 33:59.136
- It's not him. It's her.
- This is Jeanne's schedule.

33:59.177 --> 34:02.852
- Where is he now?
- He has class in 20 minutes.

34:02.897 --> 34:06.367
- He prides himself on punctuality.
- I bet he does.

34:08.456 --> 34:12.370
'Tes nobles jambes,
sous les volants qu'elles chassent,

34:12.417 --> 34:16.728
'tourment les desires obscures
et les agacent...'

34:16.777 --> 34:19.735
'The Flowers Of Evil.' Appropriate.

34:19.777 --> 34:23.452
Very good. But I'm in the middle of a lecture.

34:23.496 --> 34:28.366
Perhaps we can exchange
Baudelaire bon mots after class.

34:28.417 --> 34:31.375
Let it rip now. Class is dismissed.

34:31.417 --> 34:35.170
Henri Rousseau,
you are under arrest for the rape

34:35.217 --> 34:39.290
and murder of Jeanne Gallagher.

34:39.337 --> 34:41.293
Roll up your sleeve, please.

34:44.697 --> 34:48.406
- I'm sorry. What?
- Roll up your sleeve, please.

34:48.456 --> 34:52.449
It's kinda like a bad French film noir, isn't it?

34:52.496 --> 34:56.536
All these cops around in a circle.
Some silent.

34:56.577 --> 35:00.855
- Some lean in with cynical quips.
- Sort of.

35:00.897 --> 35:05.732
So's what you did to Jeanne.
Throwin' her down the steps to shut her up.

35:07.337 --> 35:09.692
That's not it.

35:09.737 --> 35:13.730
- Then, enlighten us.
- I didn't rape her.

35:13.777 --> 35:18.771
You raped her then pushed her.
Her head hit the stone steps.

35:18.817 --> 35:23.095
Your semen sample's
at the lab awaiting your blood.

35:23.137 --> 35:27.415
When they match,
you'll stand trial for rape-homicide.

35:27.457 --> 35:31.211
- Miss, you're badgering my client.
- It's Detective not Miss.

35:31.257 --> 35:36.490
We're not in court. Save the law
for someone who gives a damn.

35:36.537 --> 35:39.415
I didn't kill her.

35:39.457 --> 35:44.247
You thought if you dragged her body
into the bushes no one would see.

35:44.297 --> 35:47.209
- It would give you time to clean up.
- No.

35:47.257 --> 35:51.728
No? Maybe you figured
it would look like a stranger did it?

35:51.777 --> 35:55.008
No. I didn't.

35:56.097 --> 35:58.292
She was already dead.

36:00.097 --> 36:03.931
- What do you mean?
- I mean she fell.

36:05.817 --> 36:09.526
- I... I was watching them.
- Who?

36:09.577 --> 36:12.569
The two of them. Mosley.

36:12.617 --> 36:15.085
They were like animals.

36:15.137 --> 36:17.332
Like weasels.

36:17.377 --> 36:19.527
Then he left her.

36:19.577 --> 36:25.288
I waited some more. I looked through
the window while she partied.

36:27.897 --> 36:30.570
Finally she came out.

36:30.617 --> 36:34.292
At the top step she... lost her footing.

36:34.337 --> 36:38.046
She laughed... the way she always laughed.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.490
Then she fell over her shoe.

36:43.537 --> 36:46.529
And down she went.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.285
I went to her.

36:54.177 --> 36:56.372
I touched her.

36:56.417 --> 36:59.295
Did you feel for her pulse?

37:00.097 --> 37:02.736
Or something else?

37:06.217 --> 37:09.095
I could tell she was dead.

37:10.217 --> 37:14.927
So I... carried her into the garden.

37:14.977 --> 37:16.968
Why?

37:18.017 --> 37:19.052
Why?

37:24.777 --> 37:27.735
So I could make love to her.

37:39.977 --> 37:41.569
Excuse us.

37:52.337 --> 37:57.536
Well, I'll be leaving now.

38:02.857 --> 38:06.691
May God have mercy on your soul, my son.

38:10.497 --> 38:13.091
But, er, you should also realise

38:13.137 --> 38:15.970
that you're responsible
for your own legal fees.

38:16.017 --> 38:21.091
- I make my confession to God.
- Make your peace with him, then.

38:21.777 --> 38:24.086
If you drop the homicide,

38:24.137 --> 38:29.086
I'll ask Dr Rousseau
to plead to sex with a deceased person.

38:29.137 --> 38:31.890
Absent of witness?

38:31.937 --> 38:36.169
- Who saw him push her?
- Do we have a deal?

38:36.217 --> 38:39.653
- Yeah.
- A class-A misdemeanour. One year.

38:39.697 --> 38:43.690
Probably suspended
with a recommendation for counselling.

38:47.097 --> 38:49.531
Before your lawyer bails on you,

38:49.577 --> 38:53.126
ask him what three, not one,
class-A felonies amount to.

38:53.177 --> 38:55.930
- Three?
- We have you on obstruction

38:55.977 --> 38:58.650
and disturbing a crime scene.

38:58.697 --> 39:03.566
These carry one year each and
you will serve them consecutively.

39:15.977 --> 39:19.413
- Charles, it's Mutt and Jeff.
- Which one's Mutt?

39:19.457 --> 39:22.017
Did you come to help us pack?

39:22.057 --> 39:25.936
I've moved dozens of times.
Divorce, creditors, I know what it's like.

39:25.977 --> 39:28.616
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing, ma'am.

39:28.657 --> 39:32.616
- We don't bounce balls in the house.
- How's it goin'?

39:32.657 --> 39:36.093
Other than the Nugget scout
not returning my call,

39:36.137 --> 39:39.368
and the news calling me
Problem Child Four, great.

39:39.417 --> 39:41.612
- There's the Knicks.
- What the hell.

39:41.657 --> 39:43.648
Watch your mouth.

39:43.697 --> 39:46.609
- So?
- I heard you're going to Tulane.

39:46.657 --> 39:49.615
- Where did you hear that?
- I get information.

39:49.657 --> 39:52.171
- Plus I'm a fan.
- Of Tulane?

39:52.217 --> 39:55.653
Last year's sleeper in a round of sleepers.

39:55.697 --> 39:58.257
But I'm a fan of yours.

39:58.297 --> 40:02.256
Oh! In another year
you can cheer for me again.

40:02.297 --> 40:05.972
You handled yourself like a man
throughout all this.

40:06.017 --> 40:08.690
Whatever embarrassment it's caused you,

40:08.737 --> 40:11.934
wearing the red jersey and movin' away,

40:11.977 --> 40:16.653
- I apologise on behalf of my people.
- You're a weird cat, Munch.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.726
But you're cool.

40:19.777 --> 40:22.052
Thanks.

40:28.737 --> 40:32.173
- Oh, yeah. Riley Kuger.
- The bastard.

40:32.217 --> 40:34.970
He gets away with rape,
I lose a year of eligibility.

40:35.017 --> 40:38.168
He gets away with nothing.
The Grand Jury can indict him.

40:38.217 --> 40:41.971
- What goes around comes around.
- No, it doesn't.
