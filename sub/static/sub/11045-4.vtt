Apple Bloom: Hear ye, hear ye!

00:05.839 --> 00:08.042
The first post-cutie
mark meeting

00:08.076 --> 00:11.145
of the Cutie Mark Crusaders
is now in session!

00:16.484 --> 00:17.718
Ahem.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.154
Oh! I'm sorry Apple Bloom.

00:20.188 --> 00:23.624
I was distracted by the
radiance of my cutie mark.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.194
Did you say something?

00:26.227 --> 00:31.065
I mean, it's pretty amazing
how the colors just pop off

00:31.099 --> 00:35.069
your flank. It's kinda
hard to look awa- [clunk].

00:35.103 --> 00:38.172
Look. I know our cutie
marks are amazing.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.541
But is that all
we're gonna do now?

00:40.574 --> 00:43.777
Just spend our days staring
down at our own flanks?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.746
[sigh] I guess not.

00:47.548 --> 00:51.119
Yeah. I suppose that
could get real boring.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.754
Yeah.

00:55.856 --> 00:59.760
This is ridiculous! We need
to go out and do somethin'!

00:59.793 --> 01:01.629
Wow. You're right!

01:01.662 --> 01:04.398
Yeah! We need to go try
new stuff like we used to!

01:04.432 --> 01:05.433
Exactly.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.567
Like square dancing!

01:06.600 --> 01:10.304
* [country violin]

01:10.338 --> 01:11.672
Or mountain climbing!

01:11.705 --> 01:14.542
* [yodel]

01:14.575 --> 01:16.877
Or square dancing on the
mountain we just climbed!

01:16.910 --> 01:20.181
* [yodel and violin]

01:20.214 --> 01:21.282
Yeah!

01:21.315 --> 01:22.516
And the more things we try,

01:22.550 --> 01:25.553
the more chances we'll have to
finally get our cutie marks!

01:25.586 --> 01:26.454
Come on!

01:28.289 --> 01:29.757
Um... Apple Bloom?

01:39.800 --> 01:43.337
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:43.371 --> 01:45.306
* Aaaahhh

01:45.339 --> 01:47.308
* My little Pony

01:47.341 --> 01:49.710
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:49.743 --> 01:51.579
* My Little Pony

01:51.612 --> 01:54.248
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:54.282 --> 01:56.284
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:56.317 --> 01:58.452
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:58.486 --> 02:00.554
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

02:00.588 --> 02:02.590
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

02:02.623 --> 02:04.725
* To have my little pony

02:04.758 --> 02:08.229
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

02:08.262 --> 02:10.431
**

02:15.736 --> 02:18.439
Apple Bloom: Wow. Did we
really only ever do things

02:18.472 --> 02:20.808
just to get our
cutie marks?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.676
I don't know. Maybe?

02:22.710 --> 02:25.246
Aw, come on. We
did lots of stuff

02:25.279 --> 02:27.681
that didn't have anything to
do with getting a cutie mark.

02:27.715 --> 02:28.782
Of course we did.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.251
Absolutely.

02:30.284 --> 02:36.624
**

02:36.657 --> 02:39.627
Huh. So, now that we
don't have to do stuff

02:39.660 --> 02:41.395
to get our cutie marks,

02:41.429 --> 02:43.564
what is it that the Cutie
Mark Crusaders actually do?

02:46.634 --> 02:50.238
We do exactly what we
got our cutie marks in.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.939
Helping other ponies!

02:51.972 --> 02:54.275
Ponies without cutie marks!

02:54.308 --> 02:56.544
Or ponies who've forgotten
their special purpose!

02:56.577 --> 02:59.213
Exactly! We just
have to find ponies

02:59.247 --> 03:01.181
who need our help.
Come on!

03:06.254 --> 03:08.356
But are you sure
you feel content?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.523
Eeyup.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.827
Not even a tinge of
dissatisfaction?

03:13.861 --> 03:14.828
Nope.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.234
Not even the slightest
nagging sensation

03:20.268 --> 03:22.536
that you don't really know
what your purpose is in life

03:22.570 --> 03:24.738
or why you have a big
apple as a cutie mark?

03:26.740 --> 03:27.541
[grunt]

03:30.344 --> 03:31.345
Nope.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.015
The important thing to remember

03:35.048 --> 03:37.518
is that there is no rush.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.020
The three of us tried
for the longest time,

03:40.053 --> 03:42.756
but it just comes
when it comes.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.758
And it's totally
normal to feel confused

03:44.792 --> 03:46.727
and maybe even
a little lost.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.863
But being a blank flank is
nothing to be ashamed of.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.900
So if you're having even
the slightest problem...

03:52.933 --> 03:55.269
Or concerns or questions...

03:55.303 --> 03:58.472
We want you to know that
we are here to help!

03:58.506 --> 04:01.442
I don't think they're too
worried about it yet.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.978

04:29.937 --> 04:35.409
**

04:38.979 --> 04:42.583
This is gonna be a lot
harder than I thought.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.318
Who knew there
were so few ponies

04:44.352 --> 04:46.387
worried about
their cutie marks?

04:46.420 --> 04:48.822
Kinda makes you wonder why
we made such a big deal

04:48.856 --> 04:50.558
out of it for so long.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.362
What?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.930
The point is, helping ponies
with cutie mark problems

04:56.964 --> 04:58.866
is what makes us special.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.535
But if we can't find
anypony with a problem...

05:01.569 --> 05:04.338
maybe we're not special.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.339
Bulk Biceps: YEAH!

05:07.007 --> 05:08.942
I know exactly what you mean!

05:08.976 --> 05:10.878
You can't find a
cutie mark problem.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.881
I have a cutie mark
problem. It's so confusing

05:13.914 --> 05:15.416
and I feel like
the solution

05:15.449 --> 05:16.717
is staring me right
in the muzzle.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.021
What?

05:21.054 --> 05:24.392
I see why you guys hang
out here. It's cozy!

05:24.425 --> 05:29.963
The Crusader Clubhouse is a
safe place, Mr., um... Bulk.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.833
A place where we've faced all
kinds of cutie mark problems.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.469
A place where we'll go
on to solve even more,

05:35.503 --> 05:37.505
starting with yours!

05:37.538 --> 05:39.407
No matter how
long it takes.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.941
Or how hard it is.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.844
We'll solve it because
that's what we do!

05:43.877 --> 05:45.413
Yeah!

05:45.446 --> 05:47.481
[grunt]

05:47.515 --> 05:49.116
YEAH!

05:49.149 --> 05:51.785
So what's your
cutie mark problem?

05:51.819 --> 05:55.656
Oh! Right! Uh, well, my
cutie mark is a dumb bell.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.925
But I've lifted every
dumb bell in Ponyville!

05:59.560 --> 06:02.796
Have you tried
lifting other things?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.798
You mean, not
dumb bells?

06:04.832 --> 06:05.566
Yeah.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.166
Yeah.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.034
YEAH!

06:07.067 --> 06:07.935
[crash]

06:07.968 --> 06:09.537
[grunt]

06:09.570 --> 06:12.039
I mean, no. I hadn't
thought of that.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.641
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!

06:15.075 --> 06:16.577
[crash]

06:16.610 --> 06:19.847
But what happens when I
run out of other stuff?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.115
I guess you could teach
other ponies to lift things.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.751
Yeah!Yeah.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.721
YEAH! Wow. You three really
have a knack for this!

06:27.755 --> 06:29.490
That was easy!

06:29.523 --> 06:31.959
Maybe too easy.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.527
What do you mean?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.796
Well, it's looking like
cutie mark problems

06:35.829 --> 06:37.465
are few and
far between.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.999
And?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.001
And what if we never
find another one?

06:41.034 --> 06:42.603
Well...

06:42.636 --> 06:45.172
And even if we do, we
could solve it so quick

06:45.205 --> 06:47.975
it'll be like it never
happened in the first place.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.577
So?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.945
Sooo... then the
Cutie Mark Crusaders

06:51.979 --> 06:54.214
don't have any
reason to exist!

06:54.247 --> 06:55.749
* [dramatic crescendo]

06:59.152 --> 07:01.088
Sweetie Belle: The problem
boils down to this.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.190
We don't need to go out
and do things anymore

07:03.223 --> 07:04.725
to get our
cutie marks.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.059
Right! And...

07:06.093 --> 07:08.796
Ponies with Cutie Mark
problems are hard to find.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.832
Exactly. But even
when we find problems,

07:11.865 --> 07:14.602
we're so good at solving
them that most of the time

07:14.635 --> 07:17.538
there's nothing for the
Cutie Mark Crusaders to do!

07:17.571 --> 07:20.974
So, I thought we should
start figuring out ways

07:21.008 --> 07:25.078
to search all of Equestria
for cutie mark problems!

07:25.112 --> 07:27.981
That kinda seems
like a lot.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.217
I don't think Rarity
would let me travel

07:30.250 --> 07:31.952
to the far reaches
of Equestria

07:31.985 --> 07:33.854
looking for cutie
mark problems.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.690
Yeah. I'm sure we'll come
across them in Ponyville.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.959
And when we do, we'll
totally solve them

07:38.992 --> 07:40.961
because we are so
awesome at it!

07:40.994 --> 07:42.095
Ha!

07:42.129 --> 07:45.032
But what do we
do until then?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.934
Maybe whatever
we want?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.502
What do you mean?

07:48.536 --> 07:51.004
Well, we used to only do
stuff to get our cutie marks

07:51.038 --> 07:53.907
or fulfil our destiny,
but now we don't have to.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.144
So, we can do
things just for fun?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.246
Are you girls thinking
what I'm thinking?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.781
Sure am!

08:00.814 --> 08:03.817
Scooting!
Singing!
Making
potions!

08:08.188 --> 08:11.559
Just remember: Stomp.
Kick. And roll.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.061
After this, you two are gonna
love scootering as much as me.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.197
If you say so.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.899
Ready? Stomp!

08:18.932 --> 08:19.733
Kick!

08:19.767 --> 08:21.569
AND ROLL!

08:21.602 --> 08:22.736
Whoo!

08:31.244 --> 08:32.179
* Ta-da!

08:35.282 --> 08:37.651
[chuckle] I don't
think I did it right.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.555
* [pitch pipe]

08:41.589 --> 08:46.126
Doh...mi...soh

08:46.159 --> 08:47.527

simple harmony.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.234
Harmony, huh?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.903
[tap tap tap]

08:55.936 --> 08:58.906

and ah-one, two, three...

08:58.939 --> 09:01.274
* [discordant voices]

09:01.308 --> 09:02.943
Wow. That was simple.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.946
[snap]

09:05.979 --> 09:08.949
It's just a dash and
a drop and a drip.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.355
Just a dash and a
drop and a drip.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.990
[explosion]

09:21.094 --> 09:23.330
And even though Scootaloo
thinks bungee jumping

09:23.363 --> 09:24.765
is the bees knees,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.235
Sweetie Belle would
rather keep bees.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.039
Of course, I'm allergic.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.874
Who'd have thought
it would be so hard

09:33.907 --> 09:36.744
to find something for
us all to do together?

09:36.777 --> 09:41.114
Well, I know this might sound
crazy, but what if we didn't?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.182
Didn't what?

09:42.215 --> 09:46.854
Do things together. Well,
do everything together.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.356
But we're the Cutie
Mark Crusaders!

09:49.389 --> 09:52.960
And we always will be, but
I really wanna bungee jump.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.696
The speed! The height!
The fall!

09:55.729 --> 09:57.330
And I know you two
aren't interested,

09:57.364 --> 09:59.633
but I wanna try
crochet.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.533
Isn't there something

10:00.567 --> 10:02.202
you've always wanted
to do on your own?

10:06.139 --> 10:07.708
I don't know.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.243
I guess I figured we'd
always do stuff together.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.345
But bungee jumping
sounds just as scary

10:12.379 --> 10:14.882
as crochet
sounds boring.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.785
That's OK. Sweetie Belle and
I can do the things we like

10:17.818 --> 10:19.753
and you can do
whatever you like.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.089
Just as soon as you
figure out what it is.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.791
I guess.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.859
Great! Then we
can meet back here

10:25.893 --> 10:27.995
and talk all about
what we've done.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.930
But I don't know
what it'll be.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.231
You'll find something!

10:31.264 --> 10:33.734
Something awesome!

10:33.767 --> 10:37.037
[sigh] Well, I
guess now I have to.

myself out on my own *

what's next for me *

10:52.820 --> 10:58.792

have always been my home *

10:58.826 --> 11:03.731

more that I could be *

11:03.764 --> 11:09.970
* I guess as
time goes by *

11:10.003 --> 11:16.076
* Every pony has to
go out on their own *

11:16.109 --> 11:22.082
* And maybe someday
I'll have to try *

11:22.115 --> 11:25.218
* Something new
that's just for me, *

11:25.252 --> 11:28.288
* a little something
that could be *

11:28.321 --> 11:33.426

feel so left behind *

and this could mean goodbye *

* I always thought
our friendship *

11:50.510 --> 11:54.514
* Was all I'd ever need

11:54.547 --> 11:59.019
* We've always been crusadin'
what else is there for me *

11:59.052 --> 12:00.487
**

12:00.520 --> 12:06.827
* I guess as time goes by

12:06.860 --> 12:12.933
* Every pony has to
go out on their own *

12:12.966 --> 12:19.072
* And maybe someday
I'll have to try *

12:19.106 --> 12:22.209
* Something new
that's just for me *

12:22.242 --> 12:25.245
* A little something
that could be *

12:25.278 --> 12:32.085
* Just my own and I won't
feel so left behind *

12:32.119 --> 12:37.024
* [song ends]

12:41.228 --> 12:44.331
Russian accented woman:
And a-one, two, three, four!

12:44.364 --> 12:46.867
Two, two, three, four.

12:46.900 --> 12:51.238
One, two, three four.
Two, two, three, four--

12:51.271 --> 12:53.573
Whatever kind of
dancing y'all are doing,

12:53.606 --> 12:56.143
you're doing it
together and I want in!

12:59.146 --> 13:02.215
I-I mean uh, [ahem],
would it be OK

13:02.249 --> 13:04.417
if I enrolled in
this dance class?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.855
Well, let's see
what you can do.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.257
We have a recital
at Town Hall tonight

13:10.290 --> 13:12.492
and a spot just
opened up.

13:12.525 --> 13:16.029
Tender Taps is a little
too shy to perform,

13:19.099 --> 13:23.136
but if you're ready to step
into a partnered routine...

13:23.170 --> 13:25.605
That sounds an awful
lot like friendship

13:25.638 --> 13:29.176
and I'm ready for anything I
don't have to do by myself.

13:29.209 --> 13:33.046
Well, then, dancing with
partner will be perfect.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.190
* [tango rhythm]

13:43.223 --> 13:44.257
Whoaaaaaa!

13:50.931 --> 13:51.932
Whoa. Whoaaaaa!

13:51.965 --> 13:53.533
[crashing]

13:55.468 --> 13:58.338
Whew. I feel like that
went pretty good but

13:58.371 --> 14:00.540
let's give it one more whirl
because it's important

14:00.573 --> 14:02.342
that I do a good
job partnering

14:02.375 --> 14:03.843
with my new group
of friends.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.519
Ehh. Now I'm think of it, you
might be better as soloist.

14:19.292 --> 14:23.530
Teacher: Ehh, partnering is a
little advanced for you,

14:23.563 --> 14:26.900
but there's still lots
you can do on your own.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.469
I'm sorry, but doing
stuff on my own

14:29.502 --> 14:31.604
is exactly what
I don't want.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.947
Sorry it didn't
work out.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.682
Trying different things with
my friends was always fun,

14:42.715 --> 14:47.120
even when we were terrible.
Now it's just terrible.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.589
You weren't that bad; you just
need to learn a few things

14:49.622 --> 14:51.992
on your own. Being a
soloist can be fun.

14:52.025 --> 14:58.431
**

14:58.465 --> 15:00.233
[hums] Ha!

15:00.267 --> 15:02.469
**

15:02.502 --> 15:05.238
[laugh] You just have
to do it with feeling.

15:05.272 --> 15:09.042
**

15:09.076 --> 15:12.980
[sigh] Thanks, but
without my friends,

15:13.013 --> 15:15.983
I don't think I'll
ever feel again.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.684
Good luck at
the recital.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.587
Oh, I'm not going do
that. I mean, I want to.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.990
It's kind of all
I think about.

15:23.023 --> 15:27.360
I bet someday my cutie mark
will even be about performing,

15:27.394 --> 15:29.729
but I could never dance
in front of an audience

15:29.762 --> 15:33.000
the way I do in class.
That's t-t-terrifying.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.604
Yeah. OK. Nice
meeting you.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.638
You, too.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.046
Sweetie Belle, you are
not going to believe this,

15:46.079 --> 15:47.447
but I think I like
bungee jumping

15:47.480 --> 15:49.983
even more than scootering!

15:50.017 --> 15:54.421
Seriously? That's
amazing. Look what I did!

15:54.454 --> 15:58.691
Wow. Uh. That's, um...

15:58.725 --> 16:03.430
Horrible! But it was so much
fun. Rarity showed me how,

16:03.463 --> 16:06.599
even though she says "crochet
is knitting's poorer cousin."

16:06.633 --> 16:08.001
But I loved it.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.169
Awesome!

16:12.405 --> 16:19.646
Oh. Hello, girls. Have fun
pursuing your own interests?

16:19.679 --> 16:22.582
Apple Bloom? What are you
doing sitting in the dark?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.451
Yeah. We thought
you'd be out looking

16:24.484 --> 16:26.286
for things you like to do.

16:26.319 --> 16:30.457
[laugh] Oh, I did. I
looked all over town.

16:30.490 --> 16:34.494
I looked and I
looked and I looked

16:34.527 --> 16:37.130
and you know what I found?

16:37.164 --> 16:38.031
Nothing!

16:43.303 --> 16:46.239
You tried every
one of these?

16:46.273 --> 16:49.709
And each one just made me feel
more alone than the next.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.711
I don't see how I'm
supposed to be happy

16:51.744 --> 16:53.580
that we're not
hanging out anymore.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.149
Wait. I never said that.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.451
I just said we don't have
to do everything together.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.487
Like when there's something
one of us wants to do

17:00.520 --> 17:02.155
that the others don't.

17:02.189 --> 17:06.126
Oh. Well, I guess
that changes things.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.394
I can't believe
you thought

17:07.427 --> 17:09.329
we didn't want to
hang out anymore.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.298
I can't believe you
tried all this stuff

17:11.331 --> 17:13.233
and didn't find one
thing you liked.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.568
Well, I kind of
liked dancing.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.437
Mainly because it
looked like something

17:17.470 --> 17:21.241
you couldn't do alone, but
I wasn't very good at it.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.676
You don't have to be good
at something to have fun.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.579
And being good doesn't
always mean you will.

17:26.613 --> 17:30.450
I know. I met the best
dancer in the world,

17:30.483 --> 17:33.720
but he was so shy, he couldn't
bring himself to perform,

17:33.753 --> 17:37.524
even though he really,
really wanted to.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.694
I don't suppose this dancing
pony had a cutie mark, did he?

17:44.231 --> 17:47.800
**

17:47.834 --> 17:48.801
Apple Jack: You're here!

17:50.203 --> 17:51.638
SHHHHH!

17:51.671 --> 17:53.473
[cheering]

17:55.308 --> 17:57.244
What are you doing here?

17:57.277 --> 18:00.413
You told me that you wanted to
perform more than anything,

18:00.447 --> 18:03.216
but I was too caught
up in myself to listen.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.385
You're the best
dancer I've ever seen

18:05.418 --> 18:07.987
and I'm here to convince you
to get out on that stage!

18:11.858 --> 18:13.893
Um, didn't I also
tell you

18:13.926 --> 18:17.197
that dancing in front of other
ponies is t-t-terrifying?

18:17.230 --> 18:18.531
I don't know if
you noticed...

18:18.565 --> 18:20.900
...but that auditorium
is full of other ponies!

18:20.933 --> 18:23.403
I can't go out there.
What if I'm bad?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.238
We can go on together.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.275
No matter what, you'll look
good dancing next to me.

18:28.308 --> 18:32.579
[cheers and whistles]

18:32.612 --> 18:34.581
[sigh] All right.
I'll do it.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.250
But I don't have my costume
and the backdrop is all wrong

18:37.284 --> 18:38.718
and we don't have
time to change it!

18:40.387 --> 18:42.155
Leave everything to us!

18:45.925 --> 18:48.528
I don't know about this.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.430
Don't worry. You'll
be just fine.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.903
Here goes nothing!

19:14.721 --> 19:16.223

[laughter]

19:40.012 --> 19:41.681
You can't be any
worse than I was.

19:41.714 --> 19:51.758

20:07.574 --> 20:16.849
[wild cheering]

20:28.361 --> 20:30.029
I can't believe it!

20:30.062 --> 20:32.665
It's just what I always
imagined it would be!

20:32.699 --> 20:36.002
And if it weren't for all of
you, I wouldn't even have it.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.338
No problem. It's
what we do.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.642
I only wish I'd realized
what you needed right away

20:42.675 --> 20:45.011
instead of moping
around for no reason.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.814
Well, either way, I
hope you keep dancing.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.287
You know, I just might.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.723
It sure is a lot of fun
and I'm pretty confident

20:56.756 --> 20:58.425
I can only get better.

21:00.660 --> 21:04.397
I'm sorry I was so silly about
us all doing our own things.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.534
If we hadn't, I might have
never even tried dancing.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.636
Or find out I
needed help.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.339
With each of us going out and
trying things on our own,

21:12.372 --> 21:14.807
we'll be three times as likely
to find ponies to help.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.843
And trying new stuff
might even make us better

21:16.876 --> 21:19.379
at helping them, like how
I used my bungee jumping

21:19.412 --> 21:20.847
to change the sets.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.082
Or my crochet to
make the costumes.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.485
Well, one thing
is for sure:

21:25.518 --> 21:27.854
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
will never be the same.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.491
We'll be better!

21:31.524 --> 21:33.292
YEAH!
