00:24.733 --> 00:28.820
Hi, we're...
We're kind of lost, again.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.781
We're trying to get
to the CIC. Could you...

00:32.282 --> 00:33.658
No talking, no talking,
please.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.410
No cheating.
Hold it up, a little higher.

You aren't serious.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.544
Zero...

00:53.637 --> 00:57.974
I've asked you here to find out
why the Cylons hate us so much.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.977
It's what you said
at the ceremony.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.021
That humanity
was a flawed creation.

01:04.106 --> 01:07.567
And that people still
kill one another

01:07.651 --> 01:10.194
for petty jealousy
and greed.

01:10.279 --> 01:14.657
You said that humanity never asked
itself why it deserved to survive.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.618
Maybe you don't.

Galactica is harboring a Cylon agent.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.064
Eyewitnesses claim to have seen
one of the known Cylon models

03:10.148 --> 03:12.149
moving in and out
of Galactica's brig.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.111
Admiral Adama has made no
comment on this situation.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.946
We will continue...

03:20.951 --> 03:23.119
How the hell did this
get out to the press?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.996
ROSLIN: I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.331
I'm told you've been
meeting with her regularly,

03:27.416 --> 03:30.126
allowing her to interact
with members of your crew.

03:30.210 --> 03:34.630
She's a military asset providing us
with vital strategic intelligence.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.884
While we pray that she's not
somehow colluding with other Cylons.

03:37.968 --> 03:42.138
If I felt for one second that she posed
some kind of a threat to this Fleet,

03:42.222 --> 03:43.931
I'd pull the trigger
on her myself.

03:44.016 --> 03:47.143
I think the Fleet may
need to hear that, Admiral.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.608
Even more,
they need to believe it.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.444
Someone took their vitamin
this morning.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.070
Yeah, I don't know
what got into me.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.405
No, you're right.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.325
Keeping Sharon Valerii alive,
allowing her pregnancy to continue,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.410
there is no road map
for any of this.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.455
Somebody, somebody has got to
keep asking the hard questions.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.539
I agree.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.625
I want to stay ahead of this.
Acknowledge the Cylon's existence

04:10.709 --> 04:14.211
and then make some kind of case
for her to stay aboard Galactica.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.504
I don't think
that's going to work.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.631
What? Why?

04:16.715 --> 04:18.507
I think you need
to trust the people.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.176
Use the press,
tell them the truth.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.678
I mean, we barely know
anything about the Cylons,

04:22.763 --> 04:25.097
and until we learn more,
we're not gonna destroy

04:25.182 --> 04:27.975

that we have. Period.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.853
Good. That simple, huh?

Well...

04:38.695 --> 04:40.529
Could I...
Could I have a minute?

04:40.656 --> 04:42.448
Sure. Important?

04:44.826 --> 04:47.662
You were saying
about the hard questions.

04:50.707 --> 04:55.002
I know it's just my Debate Team
ring, but it's the best I could do.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.675
This really isn't
how I planned it.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.475
Anyway...

05:14.064 --> 05:15.064
Billy...

05:15.148 --> 05:16.148
I love you.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.070
I've loved you since
the first day I met you.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.739
I mean, you were
half-naked, granted.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.040
I know that I kind of
blind-sided you with this, okay?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.251
I mean, it doesn't
have to be tomorrow.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.086
We can take our time.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.302
Billy, I can't marry you.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.102
I don't know
how else to say it.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.691
I'm sorry.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.797
He pulled out that ring and
it was like an electric shock.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.552
I could barely say anything.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.640
Well, maybe you're regretting
that you didn't say yes.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.810
No. No.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.689
I don't know what to make
of me and Billy,

06:39.107 --> 06:41.233
but I know
I can't marry him.

06:43.195 --> 06:46.739
Then again, I don't know what
to make of you and me, either.

Hey, two more.

Coming right up.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.823

08:52.908 --> 08:54.742
Didn't know you were
coming down here.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.661
I grabbed
a two-day rotation.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.830
I thought I'd grab
some R and R.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.833

09:07.464 --> 09:09.006

09:21.228 --> 09:24.521
Oh, I really am an idiot,
aren't I?

09:24.606 --> 09:26.315
No, Billy...
Don't.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.276
Don't bother.
Can you give us a minute?

09:29.361 --> 09:33.948
No, you know what? Have a
seat, Captain. Be my guest.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.950
Billy, I'm sorry.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.634
I thought, if anything, we
were honest with each other.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.137
But you knew you were gonna be here with
him today, and you let me propose to you.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.222
I didn't...

09:58.306 --> 09:59.890
I know that giving you
the ring was stupid.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.183
That's fine.

10:02.686 --> 10:06.438
And maybe this wasn't gonna
work out between us. But this...

10:07.857 --> 10:09.608
You should've told me
about this.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.486
Oh, it's hard, you know,

10:12.570 --> 10:15.406
to choose the people
we fall in love with.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.534
To love only
one person at a time.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.871
People like us
are more complicated.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.291
Us?

10:27.002 --> 10:28.502
I'm sorry.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.921
I'm here with friends.

Ellen,
you're a regular here, right?

10:39.139 --> 10:42.141
You ever see that woman
before, in the corner?

10:43.727 --> 10:45.728
No. Only when I came in.

10:46.021 --> 10:49.898
And wondered when they were gonna
start enforcing a dress code.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.578
Ellen, the bathroom's
over here.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.914

in navigational weaknesses.

because of dradis interference.

ambush, I'd do it there.

is with a raft of high explosives.

open the pressure door for us.

It's his son.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.776

choose the Cylon over his son.

They're trying
to suffocate us.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.312
What is this, a trap?

21:54.397 --> 21:58.274
There's a reason you don't just
start shooting on a spaceship.

21:58.526 --> 22:02.195
You probably nicked a line. Why
don't you let me talk to the Admiral,

22:02.279 --> 22:04.364
see if we can't
find a way out of this?

22:06.701 --> 22:11.037
I've got two strike teams
inbound to you. ETA ten minutes.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.248
We'll have plenty of
firepower, so that's good,

22:13.332 --> 22:15.667
but I'm concerned
with limited access points.

it's Abinell.

We're losing oxygen.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.599
If it's not restored,
the hostages die.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.399
Then you all die,
because this is over.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.776

she wants! Give her the Cylon!

23:03.549 --> 23:05.467
You're all alone on this,

23:05.551 --> 23:09.804
I'm not gonna sacrifice a military
asset on your altar of revenge.

What are you talking about?

23:12.808 --> 23:13.767
This isn't...

23:13.851 --> 23:17.187
You said this was about
us being played by the Cylons,

23:17.271 --> 23:21.191
but it isn't. It's about the loss of
your husband, and I understand that.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.113
Itâ€™s about you wanting to strike
back, and I understand that, too.

23:27.198 --> 23:31.409
But we've all lost people that we care
about, and we learn to live with it.

23:31.494 --> 23:36.498
I am sure you are aware,
Admiral, of the concrete evidence

23:37.416 --> 23:41.878
that Caprica's defenses were
compromised by a Cylon agent

23:41.962 --> 23:45.632
who infiltrated the Ministry of
Defense on the eve of the attacks.

23:45.966 --> 23:51.429
People look for complicated answers
when something terrible happens.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.725
Maybe we were just caught
by surprise and were beaten,

23:57.269 --> 23:59.187
and maybe we have to learn
to live with that.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.023
And maybe you are
just missing the point.

24:02.316 --> 24:06.027
You were infiltrated.
You, the military.

infiltrated again, right now.

know what you're doing, but you do not.

You are being played.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.956
And the rest of us do not
want to go down with your ship.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.625
I want this air system
restored right now.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.212

fixes it, leaves.

right?

I know that.

it's not Sharon.

that looks into that thing's eyes

25:20.269 --> 25:23.688

that reported aboard

with the air.

are right?
