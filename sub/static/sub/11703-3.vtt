WEBVTT

00:00.037 --> 00:01.478
You're William Jackson?
Yeah.

00:01.738 --> 00:04.659
Michael Mears, Homicide Squad.
Can I talk to you outside?

00:05.006 --> 00:06.527
About what?

00:06.607 --> 00:09.367
The murder of Harry Smith.

00:09.487 --> 00:13.046
I thought you were out.
What happened?

00:13.165 --> 00:16.686
I'm sorry, love. It's just
better you don't come here.

00:16.805 --> 00:19.725
It doesn't cost anything to
reinstate privileges. You can

00:19.846 --> 00:23.285
phase in the smoking ban gradually,
give the women a chance to adjust.

00:23.405 --> 00:26.686
Agreed.
Cindy Lou says OK.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.445
Big order. Better not fuck up.

00:29.565 --> 00:32.405
Alright.
What did I say about Liz? You knew

00:32.525 --> 00:35.565
you should stay away from
her but you didn't, did you?

00:35.646 --> 00:37.286
Help me, Franky. Stop her.

00:37.365 --> 00:38.966
Stop her. No, no, no! Aaargh!

00:41.326 --> 00:43.765
Why didn't you stop her?
I couldn't.

00:43.885 --> 00:46.326
If I find out you're
bringing drugs into this prison,

00:46.445 --> 00:48.726
it won't be just your hands
that go into that steam press.

00:54.245 --> 00:56.644
Governor.
That's not mine!

00:56.646 --> 00:57.844
Slot her.

00:57.845 --> 00:59.945
That's bullshit!
That's not mine!

01:00.036 --> 01:01.565
Enough of that. Come on, let's go.

01:49.686 --> 01:52.566
The girls
are getting pretty shitty, Franks.

01:52.686 --> 01:54.566
They want their gear,
or their money back.

01:54.646 --> 01:56.926
I'm not a fuckin' magician, am I?

01:57.046 --> 01:59.006
Tell 'em to wait.
I'll sort something.

01:59.126 --> 02:01.806
They don't trust you, Franky.
They think you screwed up.

02:01.926 --> 02:04.725
I didn't know Jodes was
going to fuck me over, did I?

02:10.406 --> 02:13.006
You owe Cindy Lou.

02:13.086 --> 02:15.286
And she's not happy.

02:15.366 --> 02:18.526
I told her I'll get the gear.

02:18.605 --> 02:21.086
Cindy Lou wants it now.

02:21.105 --> 02:22.725
Well, I don't have
it. Tell her to be patient.

02:22.806 --> 02:26.286
You honour your contract...

02:30.605 --> 02:32.165
..or die.

02:38.966 --> 02:40.686
I'll get the gear.

02:40.806 --> 02:42.445
Just tell her to give me a
couple of days.

02:45.725 --> 02:47.336
One hour.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.125
Hey, hey,
hey, can I have a puff?

03:05.126 --> 03:07.245
Do you want me to fuckin' call Lucy?

03:07.246 --> 03:08.766
I want...
You shut your fuckin' mouth!

03:08.885 --> 03:10.846
Oh, what the fuck?
Shut up! Give me a smoke!

03:11.006 --> 03:15.926
I just want a freakin' smoke!
Can you guys stop bickering?
Go and do something else, yeah?

03:17.566 --> 03:19.526
It's like being in
a high school yard.

03:19.646 --> 03:22.846
Bea, have you thought about
talking to the new counsellor again?

03:22.966 --> 03:24.406
I don't need to.
Well, you fought hard to

03:24.526 --> 03:26.325
get her here, you might as well
take advantage of her yourself.

03:26.445 --> 03:31.526
You've been through so much, love.
I'm fine. Alright?

03:32.926 --> 03:35.686
Miss Miles?

03:35.806 --> 03:39.445
Hey, I was
just wondering if Mr Jackson's

03:39.566 --> 03:41.366
started work yet.
Why?

03:43.045 --> 03:44.806
I'm asking nicely.

03:46.846 --> 03:48.766
I thought we had an understanding.

03:50.366 --> 03:52.725
He'll be in admissions in an hour.

03:52.806 --> 03:55.686
Thank you.

03:55.766 --> 03:58.566
Oi! Heard you scored.

03:58.646 --> 04:00.646
I need the gear.

04:00.725 --> 04:02.766
Desperation looks good on you.

04:02.846 --> 04:04.806
It's kinda hot.

04:04.926 --> 04:07.325
Fuck off. You'll get it back
as soon as I get a delivery.

04:07.445 --> 04:10.885
Oh, you're gonna have to tempt me
with something else. A value-add.

04:10.966 --> 04:12.686
Like what?

04:12.766 --> 04:15.126
Fuck off!

04:15.205 --> 04:17.644
It's either that or pay top whack.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.485
How much?
Triple.

04:19.605 --> 04:23.165
Forget it.
Your loss.

04:23.286 --> 04:27.765
Alright. You'll get the cash.
Just meet me in H2.

04:27.885 --> 04:31.525
Sweet. I'll bring
the strap-on just in case.

04:34.286 --> 04:35.645
Pig.

04:44.846 --> 04:46.645
Thanks.

04:48.605 --> 04:52.125
I really don't like counsellors. You
know, they always want to pry into
your personal stuff.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.325
Give her a chance.

04:55.445 --> 04:58.325
Right.
Thanks for coming, everybody.

04:58.405 --> 05:00.605
Good to see lots of new faces.

05:00.725 --> 05:06.365
I thought today we'd kick
off by talking about the riot.

05:06.445 --> 05:08.645
Heard it was a doozy.

05:08.765 --> 05:14.165
Oh, I'm sorry. You're all expecting
a lecture. OK, I'm not a screw.

05:14.286 --> 05:17.365
You guys need to release
the pressure, and I get that.

05:17.485 --> 05:21.445
Bet the clean-up was a
pain in the arse, though.

05:23.405 --> 05:26.645
I want us to be up front with each
other. No bullshit.

05:26.725 --> 05:28.846
I need to speak to Boomer.

05:28.965 --> 05:31.405
What for?
Do you want to take a chair?

05:31.485 --> 05:34.286
Nuh. Come on.

05:43.445 --> 05:45.365
Where's my cash?

05:45.485 --> 05:49.286
The rest of my money, where is it?
Oh, I... I spent it.

05:49.405 --> 05:52.245
Don't bullshit me. I asked
you to hide it, so where is it?

05:52.245 --> 05:54.925
Well, I figured you owed me one, so

05:55.045 --> 05:56.644
I bought some chocolate from
C Block, eh.

05:56.645 --> 05:58.485
You know, for the... For the pain.

05:58.605 --> 06:01.525
I don't have time for this.
Cindy Lou is arcing up and I need to

06:01.645 --> 06:03.805
buy some gear. Yeah?
Mm.

06:03.925 --> 06:07.605
So where's my cash?
Up my arse.

06:11.286 --> 06:13.965
Fuck!

06:45.514 --> 06:49.180
Well, that sucks.
I was hoping you'd have to put out.

06:49.214 --> 06:51.974
Where's the gear?
Money first.

06:51.977 --> 06:53.656
Just give it to me.
Come on, money.

06:53.657 --> 06:54.697
Get off!

06:58.537 --> 07:00.617
Shut up.

07:08.577 --> 07:10.617
Where is it?

07:13.057 --> 07:15.497
Give me the fucking gear.

07:18.137 --> 07:22.737
Just give me the fucking gear.
I've banked it. Wanna go fishing?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.937
Hell no, I've got standards.

07:25.057 --> 07:27.737
You can't afford standards, Franky.
Not anymore.

07:27.817 --> 07:32.457
Give my love to Cindy Lou.

07:36.537 --> 07:39.336
See ya, Franky.

07:39.337 --> 07:41.257
Bye, Bea.

07:44.298 --> 07:48.737
You're in trouble.
Oh, you reckon, Batman?

07:48.817 --> 07:52.017
Well, if you need help...

07:52.137 --> 07:55.257
How are you gonna help me?
You're part of the problem.

07:55.377 --> 07:57.097
You're the reason
why I'm in this shit.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.097
Really?

07:59.177 --> 08:00.977
I'm still offering.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.257
Nuh.

08:05.257 --> 08:06.937
Fuck off.

08:09.298 --> 08:12.377
Yeah, I'm looking
forward to seeing you, too.

08:12.497 --> 08:15.017
Hey, there's something
I need you to do.

08:15.097 --> 08:16.617
I need some cash.

08:19.057 --> 08:22.017
Nah, I need you to bring it in
today. As much as you can get.

08:22.137 --> 08:25.897
Kimmy, it's important. I don't give
a fuck. Just fuckin' do it.

08:27.977 --> 08:30.136
I'm sorry, yeah?

08:30.138 --> 08:32.298
I just really need you to do it.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.778
She says it's not enough.

08:36.898 --> 08:39.097
Well, explain to her that we're
playing it safe. We need to give

08:39.217 --> 08:42.337
her body time to build up a
tolerance to the methadone.

08:46.057 --> 08:48.977
Hey! Move along or I'll slot you.

08:52.177 --> 08:53.617
Is he here?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.617
Hey, Mr Jackson.

08:58.737 --> 09:00.778
I just wanted to know what
happened with the police.

09:00.898 --> 09:03.337
Can you keep your
voice down, please?

09:03.457 --> 09:05.337
OK, well, what'd they
want to talk to you about?

09:06.937 --> 09:08.697
They had to eliminate me
from the investigation.

09:08.817 --> 09:09.937
Why would they think
you were involved?

09:10.057 --> 09:11.697
I don't know.
Maybe because I was there when

09:11.778 --> 09:14.577
you blew Brayden Holt's head off.

09:14.658 --> 09:18.418
Smith. What are you doing?

09:19.538 --> 09:22.457
Talking.
Get a move on.

09:26.497 --> 09:28.097
What'd she want?

09:28.177 --> 09:29.617
Ah, changes to roster.

09:29.697 --> 09:31.377
I told her to go see Vera.

09:31.497 --> 09:36.138
I thought, under the present circumstances,
that you'd be giving Smith a wide berth.

09:38.057 --> 09:39.497
Yes, Governor.

09:39.617 --> 09:41.937
I just want to
concentrate on my work.

09:50.577 --> 09:53.817
Fuck, you look good.

09:53.817 --> 09:56.418
Missed you.
Yeah, I missed you, too.

09:59.857 --> 10:01.937
Did you bring the cash?

10:02.057 --> 10:04.217
Yeah. Yeah.
How much?

10:04.298 --> 10:08.257
80 bucks.

10:08.377 --> 10:13.656
Hey, it's all I've got till next
week. Cool.

10:13.658 --> 10:15.977
What's happened?
Nothing.

10:16.057 --> 10:18.298
Doesn't matter.

10:26.778 --> 10:28.937
I didn't expect...
There's things I need to know.

10:29.057 --> 10:32.057
Sit down.
Liz, you know the rules.

10:32.138 --> 10:33.577
Yeah.

10:42.577 --> 10:44.577
I saw you. You were out.

10:44.697 --> 10:46.097
Yeah.
You had the chance to

10:46.217 --> 10:49.817
come and see us, to try and make
things better, but you didn't.

10:54.617 --> 10:56.697
Don't you want to be our mum?

10:56.857 --> 11:01.377
Of course I do, love... So why didn't you
contact us when you got out? I tried.

11:01.497 --> 11:04.217
Bullshit. I went to the house.
I spoke to Kay.

11:04.337 --> 11:07.257
She would have said.
I did, love. I swear.

11:08.898 --> 11:11.337
You know, I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

11:11.457 --> 11:13.737
Eight years and you never
even sent us a letter.

11:13.857 --> 11:14.977
Yeah, but your dad
told me not to write.

11:15.097 --> 11:17.097
He didn't want you to get upset.
So why'd you listen to him?

11:17.217 --> 11:20.097
Because I wanted to do what
was right for you and Artie.

11:20.217 --> 11:21.857
I have never stopped
thinking about you.

11:21.977 --> 11:25.138
You're a liar.
Quiet, please.

11:27.617 --> 11:31.177
Sweetheart, have you been drinking?

11:33.617 --> 11:37.057
Is that all you've got to say?
I can smell it.

11:37.177 --> 11:39.577
You do not
get to lecture me about drinking!

11:39.737 --> 11:43.817
If you don't calm down, I'm going to
have to ask you to leave. You got that?

11:47.418 --> 11:50.898
Sophie, you remember what happened
the night outside that pub?

11:52.617 --> 11:54.577
When you drink, love,
you're vulnerable.

11:54.658 --> 11:56.298
No, when I drink,

11:56.377 --> 11:59.898
I forget that my mum ruined my life.

11:59.977 --> 12:02.298
Oh, sweetheart!

12:02.418 --> 12:05.817
Oh, God, you haven't forgotten
a second of it. Look at you.

12:08.337 --> 12:09.817
For God's sake.
Soph, I'm sorry.

12:12.418 --> 12:14.377
Shit day, huh, Liz?

12:19.497 --> 12:21.377
Oh, God.

12:23.018 --> 12:26.737
I'm
sorry for being such a bloody sook.

12:26.817 --> 12:28.898
I heard what she said.

12:28.977 --> 12:32.097
I don't even know why I'm crying.

12:32.217 --> 12:35.937
Like, it's not like it's a
surprise. You know, I mean,

12:36.018 --> 12:39.217
I know what I've done to my kids.

12:39.337 --> 12:41.457
I'm sure you didn't
mean to hurt them, Liz.

12:43.097 --> 12:48.658
Oh, God. Oh, I would do anything to
change what happened, but I can't.

12:48.778 --> 12:52.497
And the only thing I can do is try
and stop Soph from making the same

12:52.577 --> 12:54.298
bloody mistakes that I made.

12:54.418 --> 12:56.418
Well, why don't you try
giving her a call tomorrow?

12:56.497 --> 12:58.617
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

12:58.697 --> 13:01.898
You're a good man, Mr Jackson.

13:25.960 --> 13:29.092
Linds, give us the stuff.

13:35.719 --> 13:40.178
Cindy Lou wants privacy.

13:40.257 --> 13:41.703
Please.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.888
She's ready to collect now.

13:53.993 --> 13:57.367
This is not enough.

13:57.368 --> 14:00.058
Cindy Lou thinks you take the piss.

14:00.138 --> 14:02.588
The rest is on its way.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.359
I've got some cash.
We're going to teach

14:05.480 --> 14:07.007
you a lesson now.
Let's go! Come on!

14:12.027 --> 14:14.596
Put that down, Doyle.
Put it down, now.

14:14.597 --> 14:17.570
We're just mucking around.
If I have to ask you again,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.939
you'll be charged.
Alright, chill the fuck out.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.629
Beg your pardon.
Ya happy?

14:25.080 --> 14:27.611
All of you, out.
Back to your units. Now.

14:36.325 --> 14:38.254
Looks like I just
saved you from a beating.

14:38.373 --> 14:40.221
I can take care of myself.
You know, if you can't keep

14:40.341 --> 14:42.390
control of the kitchen, we can
easily put someone else in charge.

14:42.510 --> 14:45.684
Stop trying to be a hard arse, Vera.
It doesn't suit ya.

14:45.805 --> 14:47.370
You're very close to a charge.
For what?

14:47.410 --> 14:49.459
Verbal abuse of an officer.
And what'd I say?

14:49.619 --> 14:53.876
You know what you said. What, "fuck"?
Surprised you know what that is.

14:56.407 --> 15:01.186
Alright. You're coming with me.
Good.

15:01.307 --> 15:03.758
Cos I'm freezing
my vinegar tits off.

15:06.809 --> 15:11.709
You have been charged with
verbal abuse of an officer.

15:11.829 --> 15:16.087
Have you anything to say?
She had a sense of humour bypass.

15:18.537 --> 15:20.464
Did you guys get a bulk deal?

15:20.586 --> 15:25.123
I will notify the parole board so
they can spike your application.

15:25.244 --> 15:26.810
I know my rights.
You can't cancel my hearing.

15:26.972 --> 15:33.035
Well, there's no point asking for parole
with a charge hanging over your head.

15:33.035 --> 15:36.610
Don't worry, an extra six months
with us isn't that long to wait.

15:36.690 --> 15:39.462
I'm sure it'll fly by.

15:41.309 --> 15:43.759
Come on, Doyle. Let's go.

15:46.290 --> 15:48.579
Hey, we
didn't get a chance to chat.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.868
Yeah, I'm gutted.
You're Franky Doyle, aren't you?

15:50.988 --> 15:52.595
Yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

15:52.716 --> 15:57.495
Why don't you come and see me?
What's in it for me?

15:57.615 --> 15:59.503
Well, you're up for
parole soon, aren't you?

15:59.624 --> 16:01.391
If you can show that you're
attending regular counselling,

16:01.472 --> 16:03.480
working on self-improvement,

16:03.601 --> 16:05.327
it'll look good for
the suits on the board.

16:05.407 --> 16:07.054
I need a miracle, not a counsellor.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.303
Why don't you come
and talk about it?

16:11.392 --> 16:13.280
Fuck's sake.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.662
Booms, can you
walk with me back to the unit?

16:24.284 --> 16:25.851
Um, nah, I'm not
going back to the unit.

16:25.972 --> 16:29.225
Just walk with me back to the unit.
No, I'm going to medical, alright?

16:29.304 --> 16:30.871
For my hands.

16:36.735 --> 16:39.145
You got a problem?

16:39.224 --> 16:41.112
Oh, fuck it.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.883
What the hell?
I've already blown my parole.

16:45.811 --> 16:48.945
Hey, hey! Calm down.

16:49.065 --> 16:51.836
I'm not feeling calm right now.
I'm feeling pretty fuckin' angry.

16:51.916 --> 16:53.482
So what are you gonna do about it?

16:53.564 --> 16:56.133
Alright, let's talk.

16:56.254 --> 16:58.181
I don't do talking.
If you don't calm down, I'm going

16:58.302 --> 17:00.752
to have to call for an officer.
Good! Do it!

17:03.322 --> 17:07.981
What are you fucking waiting for!? Why don't
you tell me what the problem is, Franky?

17:10.633 --> 17:12.842
This isn't achieving
anything, Franky.

17:12.922 --> 17:17.540
You're all talk.

17:17.540 --> 17:20.432
I prefer action.
Move out of the way, ladies.

17:20.433 --> 17:21.798
Move out of the way. Doyle?
Yes?

17:21.919 --> 17:24.167
What are you doing?
Franky, give it up.

17:24.248 --> 17:27.742
Doyle, step away from the shelves.

17:27.823 --> 17:29.670
What the hell is going on?

17:29.751 --> 17:31.799
I'm slotting her.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.490
Come on.
About time.

17:49.562 --> 17:51.410
Is Jodes in there?

17:51.493 --> 17:53.968
Get inside. Jodes, ya druggy skank!

17:54.117 --> 17:56.406
Oi, keep it down.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.128
Can I speak with her?
No.

18:05.259 --> 18:08.834
I want to understand where
that aggression's coming from.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.641
Well, I'll tell you
where it's coming from.

18:10.761 --> 18:14.214
She's a convicted criminal.
She threw a pan of boiling oil

18:14.336 --> 18:16.143
in somebody's face, she's a drug
dealer and a violent delinquent.

18:16.264 --> 18:18.713
She's beyond help.
Oh, I disagree.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.682
I think there's
something else going on.

18:20.763 --> 18:23.655
Your opinion is irrelevant.

18:23.733 --> 18:25.943
The department doesn't think so.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.357
Early days.
How long will she be in there for?

18:29.437 --> 18:31.566
As long as I see fit.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.835
Baby can be as tall as...
43 centimetres.

18:48.957 --> 18:51.969
43 centimetres. That's tall.
Weighs as much as 1.4 kilos.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.776
So, I reckon bub's
about that big now.

18:53.897 --> 18:58.315
And it says here that
the baby can now touch its toes.

18:58.394 --> 18:59.961
I wish I could still do that.

19:00.042 --> 19:01.809
Great.

19:01.929 --> 19:04.299
Hey, I'll give you a hand.
No, don't fuckin' touch 'em,

19:04.418 --> 19:06.668
alright?
Jesus, I'm only trying to help.

19:06.789 --> 19:09.560
Yeah, well I don't
need your help, lagger.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.014
Hey, what's your problem?
Broken bickies, thanks to

19:13.135 --> 19:14.982
the lagger.
That's enough.

19:15.103 --> 19:16.549
I didn't break your
bloody biscuits.

19:16.669 --> 19:20.123
Yeah, but my hands wouldn't be like
this if I didn't have to bash you.

19:20.244 --> 19:23.939
That doesn't even make sense.
Oh, piss off. Alright?

19:25.585 --> 19:27.312
Phoar, Boomer, you stink. When's
the last time you had a shower?

19:27.433 --> 19:29.803
I can't do anything with
these hands!

19:29.883 --> 19:31.088
I said that's enough!

19:32.614 --> 19:37.072
Alright.
Give Liz the biscuits.

19:37.193 --> 19:40.526
Until those bandages are off,
she's gonna be your helper.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.573
Alright? You can start by
giving her a shower. She's rank.

19:42.695 --> 19:44.904
What?
No way is she

19:45.024 --> 19:48.478
gonna touch my vajayjay.
And in return, you're gonna

19:48.598 --> 19:51.210
be Liz's minder. Anything
happens to her, anything at

19:51.290 --> 19:53.579
all, I'm holding you responsible.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.587
Now do we have an understanding?

19:55.708 --> 19:57.234
Liz?
Yeah, yeah.

19:57.314 --> 19:59.604
Boomer?

19:59.724 --> 20:01.853
Boomer!
OK.

20:01.933 --> 20:03.499
Good.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.166
There is no way you
are showering me.

20:10.287 --> 20:13.178
That's fine by me.
Good.

20:13.259 --> 20:15.548
Give me the damned biscuits.

20:15.669 --> 20:18.079
Please, Boomer.
Please, Boomer.

20:18.159 --> 20:20.206
Here we are.

20:25.429 --> 20:27.477
I hate my life.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.955
Oh, bloody... Fuck! Fuck.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.296
Ohh.

20:50.370 --> 20:51.976
Oh, cheers.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.112
Oh, ta.

20:58.162 --> 21:00.330
Shouldn't Liz be here
helping you with this?

21:00.451 --> 21:03.021
Nah. Gave her the slip.
Don't want that old bag

21:03.182 --> 21:07.961
following me around anyway. You must be pretty
pissed off with her. Yeah. She's a dog.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.383
Here.
Cheers.

21:14.669 --> 21:17.961
Does it still hurt?
Shit, yeah.

21:18.082 --> 21:19.850
But the lunatic
soup's been helping, eh.

21:21.496 --> 21:23.505
Well, do you want me
to go get you some?

21:23.585 --> 21:25.071
Where's your stash?

21:25.151 --> 21:27.762
Ah, it's a secret.

21:27.842 --> 21:29.328
Anyway, it's almost gone, so...

21:29.449 --> 21:32.982
Well, I could help make some, if
you'd like.

21:32.983 --> 21:37.520
Serious?
Well, we're friends, aren't we?

21:37.642 --> 21:39.329
I think what Bea did to
you was really unfair.

21:39.409 --> 21:42.462
Liz deserved everything she got.

21:42.541 --> 21:45.474
Yeah. Yeah.

21:46.598 --> 21:48.486
Alright.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.619
Under the kitchen sink, there's
a big drainpipe. There's a bottle

21:51.739 --> 21:54.992
taped to the back of that. Yeah,
but don't tell anyone, alright?

21:55.073 --> 21:57.041
I won't. It's our secret.

21:58.728 --> 22:02.262
I used to think you were a
bit creepy, but you're alright, aren't ya?

22:03.266 --> 22:04.752
Can I have anothery?

22:51.422 --> 22:53.790
Please, stop!

22:53.791 --> 22:55.880
Just leave me alone!

22:57.085 --> 22:59.373
I just wanna go back to my cell.

23:00.258 --> 23:01.824
Argh!

23:03.471 --> 23:05.318
Please help me!

23:35.963 --> 23:41.063
Hey, Jodes.
Jodes, are you there?

23:43.875 --> 23:47.329
What happened?

23:57.370 --> 23:59.738
Good morning.

23:59.739 --> 24:03.192
Breakfast in bed was an hour ago.

24:03.193 --> 24:08.052
I've got good news.
You're not wearing any underwear?

24:08.053 --> 24:11.628
The Governor has
agreed on your release.

24:13.555 --> 24:16.968
I'm happy here, thanks.
Governor wants you out.

24:16.969 --> 24:20.181
Why?
Well, I have suggested that a

24:20.181 --> 24:22.672
counselling program might
be more beneficial.

24:22.673 --> 24:24.559
Yeah, I heard you trying
that yesterday.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.407
But why has Ferguson changed her mind?
Come on, Doyle.

24:26.408 --> 24:28.253
We haven't got all day.
I'm gonna tell you why.

24:28.255 --> 24:30.664
She wants me out of here so she can
get to Jodie.

24:30.665 --> 24:34.399
We can talk about Jodie later.
No, she came in last night.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.286
She did something to her.
She was crying.

24:36.288 --> 24:40.304
Franky, come on.
I wanna stay.

24:40.425 --> 24:42.192
Tough. Move.
Nuh.

24:42.271 --> 24:45.566
Don't make me drag you out of here.

24:45.646 --> 24:48.738
Fine.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.320
Come on.

24:59.542 --> 25:02.394
Liz?

25:10.748 --> 25:12.796
Oh, come on, motherfucker!

25:15.608 --> 25:18.539
Oh, bullshit!
Oh, come on!

25:18.540 --> 25:26.893
Oww! Fuck! Ow! Jeez, give me a
break.

25:28.661 --> 25:32.596
Oh, I'm stuck, I'm stuck,
I'm stuck. Oh, jeez.

25:32.597 --> 25:36.412
I was stu... Oh, go away!

25:36.533 --> 25:39.786
You need help.
Oh, no way, Jose.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.915
You don't need to
feel embarrassed, OK?

25:42.034 --> 25:44.605
I know what I'm doing.
I used to care for disabled people.

25:44.726 --> 25:48.220
Do I look like a fuckin'
disabled person to you?

25:50.228 --> 25:51.755
Yes.

25:51.835 --> 25:53.642
Forget about it. Forget about it.

25:53.763 --> 25:57.377
I'm not letting anyone touch my
bits. Especially not you, man-lady.

25:57.498 --> 26:01.394
OK. I'm going to take your arm...
No, you're not.

26:01.514 --> 26:03.402
And I'm going to help
you to the shower.

26:03.522 --> 26:05.089
No!
And we're going to freshen you up.

26:05.209 --> 26:07.940
No, I don't need... No, I don't need
freshening up!

26:15.571 --> 26:18.503
Close your eyes,

26:18.584 --> 26:21.837
and imagine you're somewhere nice,

26:21.957 --> 26:24.769
like at a day spa
with your boyfriend.

26:24.889 --> 26:28.664
Nah, my boyfriend dumped me so I
wouldn't be at a day spa with him.

26:28.785 --> 26:30.471
OK.
Is there anyone else you find hot?

26:30.552 --> 26:34.368
Fev. I'd so get naked with Fev, eh.

26:34.448 --> 26:36.617
There you go. Fev.

26:36.697 --> 26:39.830
Imagine you're on a date with Fev.

26:39.910 --> 26:41.757
Close your eyes

26:41.838 --> 26:45.613
and let Fev pamper you.

26:46.015 --> 26:47.862
Now, turn around.

26:51.758 --> 26:57.139
No, hang on. Why are you doing this?
No-one ever does nice shit for me, eh?

26:57.140 --> 26:59.871
It's what I do. Hm?

27:33.408 --> 27:39.833
So, Bea, yeah, I've been a cop
for a while now and I've seen

27:39.834 --> 27:43.528
a lot of domestic violence,
and I can understand

27:43.649 --> 27:47.224
why a woman like you
would kill her husband.

27:48.870 --> 27:52.445
I didn't kill my husband.
Well, you tried to once.

27:52.606 --> 27:57.746
Yeah, those charges were dropped.
But now your husband really is
dead, and I want to know why.

27:57.867 --> 28:00.919
Don't you want to know why?
Yeah, I do.

28:02.526 --> 28:07.386
I've been thinking that, um,

28:07.546 --> 28:12.928
the Holts, the Holts crew, they would have
wanted him dead after what I did.

28:13.049 --> 28:16.020
Revenge motive?
That's interesting.

28:16.021 --> 28:23.169
Except, when Vinnie died, his
little organisation disbanded.

28:24.816 --> 28:26.543
Now they wouldn't be
interested in Harry.

28:26.664 --> 28:29.074
You, on the other hand,
you're a person who's known

28:29.154 --> 28:32.728
for taking revenge.

28:32.849 --> 28:36.865
You owned a house together,
and it sold recently, didn't it?

28:36.985 --> 28:38.752
Now you won't have to settle
for just half the money.

28:38.874 --> 28:41.324
300 grand profit, hey?
Give or take.

28:41.444 --> 28:44.617
Why would I care about money?
Ah!

28:44.737 --> 28:47.509
Now that's a very
good question, Bea,

28:47.629 --> 28:49.637
and I've been thinking about that.
You're wasting your time. I was

28:49.758 --> 28:52.891
locked up in here. I didn't do it.
Yeah, I know you didn't.

28:53.050 --> 28:57.268
So why're you still grilling me? Because I think
you know who did. No I don't. Will Jackson.

29:00.602 --> 29:03.574
This is a joke.
You've got a history.

29:03.694 --> 29:07.189
He was there when you escaped,
when you murdered Brayden Holt.

29:07.309 --> 29:09.398
Did he help you?
No, no, he was

29:09.518 --> 29:11.486
exonerated and you know that.
Where there's smoke,

29:11.607 --> 29:15.140
there's a dodgy officer.
Why would Will want

29:15.261 --> 29:17.470
to get rid of Harry?
I think you're a team,

29:17.591 --> 29:20.483
and I think you planned to
get rid of Harry together.

29:20.563 --> 29:22.009
They've got a history, too.

29:22.089 --> 29:23.696
No they don't.

29:29.078 --> 29:32.009
This police report says otherwise.

29:34.018 --> 29:39.359
Five months ago, Will Jackson
threatened your ex-husband

29:39.440 --> 29:42.653
with an axe.

29:42.773 --> 29:46.266
So, shall we start
this conversation again?

29:49.438 --> 29:51.772
Are you in trouble with
the other prisoners?

29:51.992 --> 29:54.408
You clearly wanted to be
slotted yesterday. Why is that?

29:54.487 --> 29:56.622
Talking isn't going to help me.

29:56.742 --> 29:59.560
Talking achieves jack shit.
You're studying law.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.572
So?

30:01.652 --> 30:04.107
Isn't that all talk?

30:04.228 --> 30:08.051
I hear you're pretty good.
You can state a case, debate

30:08.213 --> 30:12.599
important issues, form conclusions,
except about your own life. Why is that?

30:14.330 --> 30:17.912
You're working to improve the lives
of other people but not your own.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.810
I think that is a shame.
You can't help me, so give it up.

30:20.971 --> 30:25.356
I'm fucked, and so is my parole. What do
you really want out of life, Franky?

30:25.357 --> 30:30.306
Can you see yourself ever leaving
this place? Yeah.

30:30.307 --> 30:35.540
Pretty fuckin' soon, actually.
How do you envisage that?

30:37.149 --> 30:39.443
Describe your ideal scenario to me.

30:39.564 --> 30:43.628
How would you like
this chapter of your life to end?

30:43.750 --> 30:47.009
What's the point?
Humour me. Paint me a picture.

30:57.474 --> 31:00.331
I want to walk out of those gates.

31:00.452 --> 31:06.650
All this place, and everyone in
it is just a smoking pile of ashes.

31:06.810 --> 31:12.646
And I wanna be picked up by a hot girl in
a hot car and driven off into the sunset.

31:16.872 --> 31:20.372
So how's that picture?
Says it all.

31:20.373 --> 31:23.714
Anger and hope,
that's you all over.

31:25.484 --> 31:29.468
You've been here five fuckin' minutes,
so don't make assumptions about me.

31:29.550 --> 31:31.923
There's no fuckin' hope.

31:32.045 --> 31:35.182
Yeah, you're wrong.
No, I'm a realist.

31:35.183 --> 31:40.294
And right now my options range
from shithouse to cluster fuck.

31:40.295 --> 31:44.480
I'm going to help you stop
self-sabotaging, Franky.

31:44.601 --> 31:46.614
I'm going to help
you get out of here.

31:46.734 --> 31:50.155
Yeah, well, stick around, cos I'm
gonna be leaving here in a coffin.

32:07.822 --> 32:09.350
Liz, you right?

32:09.352 --> 32:12.610
Oh, I'm just waiting for the phones
to open. Hey, Mr Jackson.

32:12.612 --> 32:16.838
What's this about you going round
to my house and threatening Harry?

32:19.574 --> 32:21.626
He tried to run me off the road.

32:21.627 --> 32:26.497
What?
He thought we were together.

32:26.618 --> 32:31.125
I went around to his place
after and he called the cops.

32:31.205 --> 32:33.540
Why didn't you tell me this?

32:35.592 --> 32:38.006
Hey? Did you go around there again?

32:38.088 --> 32:40.382
Did you see him again?

32:40.501 --> 32:44.165
I've got enough on my plate
without you firing questions at me.

32:44.285 --> 32:47.103
I don't answer to you.
You got that?

32:47.224 --> 32:50.805
You got that?
Yeah.

32:50.886 --> 32:54.104
Hey.

32:54.226 --> 32:55.877
Are you OK?
Yeah.

32:55.997 --> 32:59.177
What'd the police want?
Oh, same old questions.

32:59.298 --> 33:02.316
Well, who do they think did it?
Dunno.

34:59.669 --> 35:01.432
Cindy Lou will finish you now.

35:37.022 --> 35:40.708
You stay away from me,
you understand? Do you understand?!

35:40.708 --> 35:43.714
We can't hear you!

35:43.714 --> 35:46.919
Understand.
And what about you?

35:46.921 --> 35:50.287
You got that? Cos we
all know you're the real boss.

35:55.979 --> 35:58.785
Is that a yes? Right, let her go.

36:04.916 --> 36:07.721
You've got your money. Now fuck off.

36:14.615 --> 36:17.139
Ah, pleasure doing business.

36:17.140 --> 36:21.026
Let me know if you want seconds.

36:21.028 --> 36:25.195
Clearly you enjoy an older woman.

36:42.871 --> 36:47.478
Come on, come on.
Hey, Viv, don't... Fuckin' hell.

36:47.479 --> 36:53.129
Slow up. Shit. Oh, Jess.

36:53.131 --> 36:55.694
Jess, love, can I...
Can I push in? Just this once.

36:55.695 --> 36:59.742
It's... It's really important.
Sure.

36:59.742 --> 37:01.907
Thank you.
But you owe me.

37:01.908 --> 37:04.953
Yeah. Yeah. I owe ya.

37:14.973 --> 37:16.376
Soph! Love, it's me. It's your mum.

37:17.296 --> 37:22.867
Sorry, Soph, no, no, darling, I need...
Just calm down, calm down.

37:22.867 --> 37:26.113
Tell me...
Tell me what's the matter? You...

37:26.115 --> 37:30.762
Hang on, Soph, you're going to have
to slow down, love.

37:30.763 --> 37:34.208
Slow down. Soph?

37:34.210 --> 37:36.014
Sophie.

37:50.241 --> 37:53.287
Vera, you got a sec? Not really.

37:53.288 --> 37:56.533
It's about Franky Doyle, the verbal
abuse charge. Yeah, what about it?

37:56.534 --> 37:59.498
I was wondering if
you'd reconsider.

37:59.499 --> 38:03.306
Now why would I do that?
Well, Franky's a smart woman

38:03.307 --> 38:05.992
and I want to help her, but to do
that I need to give her hope for a

38:05.992 --> 38:09.238
potential future away from here.

38:09.239 --> 38:12.524
Do you know plenty of people
have tried to help Franky?

38:12.525 --> 38:15.769
They have all failed.

38:15.771 --> 38:19.697
Governor's expecting me.
Well, she just needs the right mentor.

38:19.699 --> 38:26.071
You know, self-belief can mean the
difference between success and failure.

38:28.797 --> 38:31.121
I have to run it by the Governor.

38:31.122 --> 38:34.969
OK. I would have thought she'd allow
you some autonomy. Of course she does.

38:34.969 --> 38:42.143
Right. You filed the charge, shouldn't it
be your decision? Leave it with me.

38:55.288 --> 38:59.175
Worst day ever? Hey, Franky?
Huh?

38:59.176 --> 39:05.708
I've cleared your debt.

39:05.709 --> 39:07.912
What?
I just spoke to Cindy Lou and Tina.

39:07.913 --> 39:11.079
It's all over.

39:13.364 --> 39:15.768
I didn't ask you to do that.
I never asked for your help.

39:15.769 --> 39:18.253
Well, I don't want shit going down
that I didn't approve of.

39:18.254 --> 39:23.342
This isn't about you. I can look
after myself, you got that? I'm not
one of your fuckin' pet projects.

39:23.344 --> 39:26.789
"Projects"?
I was protecting you.

39:26.790 --> 39:31.239
That's a laugh. Bea Smith,
the great protector.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.726
Didn't work out for that daughter of
yours, did it?

39:34.846 --> 39:38.413
Or your husband.
Everyone you touch ends up dead.

39:38.492 --> 39:40.175
You're not a protector.

39:40.256 --> 39:43.181
You're the Grim fuckin' Reaper.

40:09.409 --> 40:13.117
Bea. Your door.
Shut the door.

40:13.124 --> 40:14.887
I don't want them
to see me like this.

40:20.455 --> 40:25.305
Come here. Come here.
Come here, babe.

40:29.032 --> 40:33.800
Oh, God, I don't even know
why the fuck I'm crying.

40:39.372 --> 40:46.705
I hated Harry. After everything
he did to me, I wanted him dead.

40:46.705 --> 40:52.236
I wanted him dead. But now he is,
I wish I could take it all back.

40:52.236 --> 40:58.969
Oh, how fucking weak is that?
It's not weak.

40:58.970 --> 41:03.137
He was your last link to Debbie
and your old life.

41:03.138 --> 41:07.587
I thought I was
stronger than this.

41:10.192 --> 41:13.879
You're the strongest woman
I've ever met.

41:16.484 --> 41:21.574
All I am is a woman with a shitload
of blood on her hands.

42:20.969 --> 42:22.853
Franky.
What do you want now?

42:22.854 --> 42:24.775
She's done you a favour, Doyle.

42:24.777 --> 42:26.218
We both have.
Don't make us regret it.

42:26.220 --> 42:31.109
Ms Bennett has kindly agreed to
withdraw the verbal abuse charge.

42:31.110 --> 42:36.078
Ms Westfall thinks you have
potential, and I hope she's right.

42:36.079 --> 42:40.968
Now, there are conditions. First, that you
attend regular counselling sessions, starting

42:40.968 --> 42:44.656
tomorrow. And second, that
you apologise to Ms Bennett.

42:46.620 --> 42:51.429
Is this for real?
I can apply for my parole again?

42:51.429 --> 42:54.195
If you behave.

42:56.438 --> 43:02.611
I'm sorry, Ms Bennett. I was out of
line.

43:06.740 --> 43:10.146
This is your last chance.

43:16.638 --> 43:20.164
See you tomorrow at 11.00.
Thanks, Gidget.

43:20.165 --> 43:23.733
Bridget.
I prefer Gidget.

43:37.399 --> 43:38.922
Hey.
Hi.

44:02.729 --> 44:06.295
Why were they taking your DNA?
I told you to stay away from me.

44:06.296 --> 44:09.140
If we keep being seen together,
word'll get back to the cops.

44:09.140 --> 44:11.907
No, did they find some DNA at the
scene? Is that why they're testing you?

44:11.907 --> 44:15.835
Get your hands off me. He was my
husband. I've got a right to know.

44:17.838 --> 44:20.722
Hey, why won't you tell me? I didn't
fuckin' kill him, OK?

44:20.722 --> 44:24.852
Well so why are you a suspect, then?
Because I was there.

44:26.614 --> 44:29.902
I was at the house
the night he died.

44:31.906 --> 44:34.470
I wanted to talk to him, to stop him
from testifying against you.

44:35.432 --> 44:37.477
You happy now?
