00:02.733 --> 00:04.033
- VERNON: Previously
on "Still The King"--

00:04.133 --> 00:05.467
- Vernon Burning Brown.

00:05.567 --> 00:07.233
I opened for you,
now you're trying to sneak

00:07.333 --> 00:08.967
into my sold-out
massive arena show.

00:09.067 --> 00:10.867
Man, that's rich...like me.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.167
- What you got going on?

00:12.267 --> 00:14.667
- Man, I just wanna get back
to the real me, my music.

00:14.767 --> 00:17.533
- I'm not trying to make you
biggest star in country music.

00:17.633 --> 00:19.567
I'm trying to make you
the biggest star in the world.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.700
- What the hell?
- You said I could trust you.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.200
- I think we can take the money
from other investors to pay him,

00:24.300 --> 00:26.633
and then he'll tell his friends,
and then they'll invest, and

00:26.733 --> 00:28.733
then no one will really know
where the money comes from.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.033
Is that bad?

00:30.133 --> 00:31.633
- Normally, I'd say yes.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.200
- *

00:37.300 --> 00:38.933
- RONNIE: My name is Ronnie.

00:39.033 --> 00:40.133
Not this guy.

00:40.233 --> 00:41.367
- [tires squeal]

00:41.467 --> 00:42.567
- RONNIE: There, that's me.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.867
Just leased this baby.

00:43.967 --> 00:47.200
Last week, I made $940,
which really pissed me off.

00:47.300 --> 00:50.833
Because it was only
$9,060 short of 5 figures.

00:50.933 --> 00:53.633
Give her a bath
and a hot rubdown.

00:53.733 --> 00:55.400
- [keys jingle]

00:55.500 --> 00:56.433
- *

00:56.533 --> 00:58.133
- RONNIE: No, no,
my jacket was white,

00:58.233 --> 01:01.300
like Don Johnson
in "Miami Vice."

01:01.400 --> 01:04.067
I work hard, I play hard.

01:04.167 --> 01:07.133
And I demand a lot of respect.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.233
- Wow.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.100
You have really come up quickly.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.167
- So, like I was saying
30 minutes ago,

01:12.267 --> 01:14.067
this sink here is all fixed.

01:14.133 --> 01:16.333
And I gotta get going.

01:16.433 --> 01:19.200
- *

01:30.767 --> 01:32.900
- That guy's either
a calculated genius

01:33.067 --> 01:34.200
or a [bleep] moron.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.133
- Jim, language.

01:36.233 --> 01:41.067
No, no, Ronnie,
he's definitely our guy.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.933
- *

01:44.067 --> 01:45.867
- [tires squeal]

01:48.900 --> 01:53.700
- [guitar plays]

01:53.800 --> 01:56.667
- [knocking at door]

01:56.767 --> 01:57.967
- Can you get that, Deb?

01:58.067 --> 02:00.600
I'm working on this thing here--
- [knocking continues]

02:00.700 --> 02:02.267
- Got a rabbit
on the run here.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.133
- [guitars plays]

02:05.233 --> 02:07.333
- Greetings and salutations.

02:07.433 --> 02:10.367
I'm Crazy Dave.
- It's for you.

02:10.467 --> 02:11.900
- Hey, Dave, what are you
doing here?

02:12.067 --> 02:16.267
- Oh. Vernon Brown,

02:16.367 --> 02:19.667
you have been hand-selected
to be shadowed

02:19.767 --> 02:23.233
by one of the great thespians
of this generation.

02:23.333 --> 02:28.700
Not since Brando--
- Surprise, surprise, surprise!

02:28.800 --> 02:30.067
Great job, Dave.

02:30.133 --> 02:32.167
Next time, let's just cut
that down a little bit, buddy.

02:32.267 --> 02:33.833
- Trayne, what are you
doing here?

02:33.933 --> 02:35.100
- I'm doing you.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.733
I'm playing Vernon Brown
in the movie.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.967
- What the hell
are you talking about?

02:39.067 --> 02:40.100
- You didn't hear?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.067
CMT's a movie of the week
about you.

02:42.133 --> 02:44.833
- Well, by God, it's about time
they honored me for my music.

02:44.933 --> 02:46.333
- [laughing]

02:46.433 --> 02:48.400
They ain't doing nothing
about your music, man.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.633
It's about you scamming that
church, being a deadbeat dad.

02:51.733 --> 02:53.400
- I didn't give
anybody permission

02:53.500 --> 02:55.300
to do anything
with my life story.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.933
- It's an unauthorized
biography, man.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.400
They don't need permission.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.433
- Vernon, those things
are always sensationalized.

03:01.533 --> 03:03.433
I mean, they're gonna make you
look like a horrible person.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.633
Look what they did
to poor Tori Spelling.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.367
- Who is this
sweet little treasure?

03:08.467 --> 03:11.967
- Oh, that's Debbie.
Charlotte's Mama.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.633
- How do we feel about Debbie?
What's our emotion?

03:16.733 --> 03:19.767
- Oh, well, Debbie,
uh, she's cool.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.533
I mean, even though
she's with another guy.

03:22.633 --> 03:25.167
Uh, it doesn't bother me at all.

03:25.267 --> 03:26.833
Hell, I don't even think
about it, you know?

03:26.933 --> 03:27.867
It doesn't bother me.

03:27.967 --> 03:29.467
- Okay. So seeing her
with another guy

03:29.567 --> 03:31.200
makes you jealous,
but you can't admit it.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.600
You're losing her, man.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.300
Tearing you up inside.
- That's one way of putting it.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.300
- Okay, okay, I got it.
So we're an idiot.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.933
Debbie...you look radiant.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.300
- Why thank you.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.667
Now I think I like this version
of Vernon better.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.700
- Dave, why don't you
go wait in the chopper?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.067
- Really?

03:48.100 --> 03:50.067
Permission to ride on
the inside this time, Captain?

03:50.167 --> 03:51.800
- Permission denied, Private.

03:51.900 --> 03:52.933
[whistles]

03:53.067 --> 03:57.233
Now, Vern, as
a singer--I put the switch.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.300
Go right
into entertainment mode.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.100
But as an actor,
I am method, man.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.633
Gotta feel it, gotta see it.

04:06.733 --> 04:08.467
I gotta hear it,
smell it, taste it.

04:08.567 --> 04:10.300
What is that?

04:10.400 --> 04:13.633
I gotta get right up into that
headspace of failure of yours.

04:13.733 --> 04:16.067
So I'm gonna have to follow
you around for a day,

04:16.167 --> 04:17.533
do some character research.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.067
Not gonna be in the way.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.933
Just a fly on the wall.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.200
- Not gonna happen, Trayne.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.933
- I thought you might say that.

04:24.067 --> 04:28.367
That's why I got...1400 big ones
with your name on it.

04:28.467 --> 04:31.667
Say half now, half later?

04:31.767 --> 04:34.367
- That changes things.
- That changes things.

04:34.467 --> 04:35.767
- What are you doing
with your mouth?

04:35.867 --> 04:37.533
- Oh, what are you doing
with your mouth?

04:37.633 --> 04:39.633
- No, the--
- [mumbling]

04:39.733 --> 04:41.067
- That's weird.
- That's weird.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.900
- You're freaking me out.
- You're freaking me out.

04:43.067 --> 04:44.567
- Stop doing that.
- Stop doing that.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.833
- *

04:47.933 --> 04:49.467
- Where are you headed,
young lady?

04:49.567 --> 04:53.067
- Oh, hold on. I have a note.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.367
Orthodontist appointment.

04:54.467 --> 04:58.400
- Mm, if I call this number,
your mom will answer?

04:58.500 --> 05:01.400
- Yeah, of course.
- [clears throat]

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
- [dialing phone]

05:03.600 --> 05:06.500
- [phone ringing]

05:06.600 --> 05:10.933
- Uh, I--I think I grabbed
my mom's phone by accident.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.267
- Come with me.

05:12.367 --> 05:15.433
- *

05:15.533 --> 05:17.200
- When are you taking
that stuff off, man?

05:17.300 --> 05:18.533
You're starting to creep me out.

05:18.633 --> 05:21.100
- When I crawl into character
Pacino style,

05:21.200 --> 05:23.667
I don't escape until
the director says, "Cut!"

05:23.767 --> 05:25.733
- Listen, man, I only got
a couple hours in here,

05:25.833 --> 05:28.067
I'm really gonna need you
to be that fly on the wall.

05:28.167 --> 05:29.300
- Fly on the wall. Buzzz.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.900
- *

05:31.067 --> 05:33.467
- So I was like,
"Sure, I'm your preacher."

05:33.567 --> 05:36.067
So I grabbed a big, old pile
of cash from the coffer

05:36.167 --> 05:39.367
and took off in a stolen
bread truck full of hookers.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.900
- [laughs] You sound
just like Vernon.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.867
- Not how that went,
but nobody cares.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.300
Alright, sorry about that,
Courtney.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.667
I know we're on a time crunch,
buddy, let's get it going.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.433
- Man, are you kidding me?
That was great.

05:49.533 --> 05:51.633
- Trayne has over 10 million
Twitter followers.

05:51.733 --> 05:54.200
- So we wrote the song about
Debbie, yet we haven't told her

05:54.300 --> 05:55.600
about it or played it for her.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.367
This character makes no sense.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.133
- Oh, okay, speaking
of not making sense,

06:00.233 --> 06:02.167
how 'bout you getting behind
the console, okay?

06:02.267 --> 06:04.833
- If we can knock this out,
I can get to lecture on aliens

06:04.933 --> 06:06.600
I was telling you about.
- What is Walt?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.333
Like a sidekick?
- Hey, I'm no sidekick.

06:08.433 --> 06:09.900
Vernon's friend.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.267
Somebody who's around as
a confidant in case he wants

06:12.367 --> 06:13.567
to voice his innermost feelings.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.600
- Yeah, right. [laughs]

06:15.700 --> 06:18.433
Fly on the wall.

06:18.533 --> 06:21.300
- Okay, everybody, let's do it
just like we rehearsed it, okay?

06:21.400 --> 06:24.433
Courtney, let's roll one.
- Okay, we are now rolling.

06:24.533 --> 06:27.333
- Two, three, four, five.

06:27.433 --> 06:30.733
- *

06:36.600 --> 06:39.800
* If I never see
your smile again *

06:39.900 --> 06:41.233
- I don't mean to interrupt--

06:41.333 --> 06:42.600
- Good, then here we go.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.167
- Well, I think if you
cut out that intro, bang,

06:45.267 --> 06:47.100
you can jump right in faster.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.567
It's just a suggestion.

06:48.667 --> 06:49.700
- We're not doing that.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.567
Come on, let's do it
like we rehearsed, okay?

06:51.667 --> 06:54.700
Everybody, ready?
One, two, three.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.233
- *

07:02.667 --> 07:04.600
- Man, when you're right,
you're right, Vern.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.900
It's better that way.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.067
Fly on the wall.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.800
- Are you done now?

07:08.900 --> 07:09.867
You sure?

07:09.967 --> 07:11.400
Okay, come on. One more time.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.467
Let's lay it down.

07:12.567 --> 07:13.967
Ready, Courtney,
hit it, rolling.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.300
- *

07:15.400 --> 07:16.833
- Three, four, yeah.

07:16.933 --> 07:20.900
- Uh, it's just toying
with my mind right now.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.967
Let me show ya.
Try it like this.

07:23.067 --> 07:27.933
* Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah *

07:28.067 --> 07:30.933
* Cluck, cluck,
blah, blah, blah *

07:31.067 --> 07:32.633
- Yeah, it's less melancholy.

07:32.733 --> 07:33.700
It's more driving.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.967
Great suggestion, T.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.133
- Call me, Vernon.

07:36.233 --> 07:37.133
- Great suggestion, Vernon.

07:37.233 --> 07:38.233
- Hell no.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.667
- Hey, wait, Vernon.
Where are you going?

07:39.767 --> 07:41.733
- Smoke break.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.233
- COURTNEY: Okay, guys,
take ten.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.467
- Hi there.
Mind if we join you?

07:48.567 --> 07:50.267
- Sorry, fellas,
Ronnie only eats alone.

07:50.367 --> 07:52.233
That's why I bought out
the whole Hibachi.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.233
Bosho, dog me.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.833
- Nice catch.
- Real impressive.

07:58.933 --> 08:00.667
- Hey, can you teach me
that trick?

08:00.767 --> 08:01.933
- If you're gonna hover over me,

08:02.067 --> 08:03.400
you might as well
watch and learn.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.700
- Great, so, um,
my name's Gene.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.100
That's Jim.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.100
- Why do you always
feel the need to introduce me?

08:09.200 --> 08:11.400
I'm a grown man.
I can introduce myself.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.733
- Because, Jim, you never do.

08:12.833 --> 08:16.467
- Hi, I'm Jim. Happy?

08:16.567 --> 08:18.867
- Uh...hi.

08:18.967 --> 08:20.333
- [flame sizzling]

08:20.433 --> 08:22.433
- Oooh!

08:22.533 --> 08:24.233
- This place is not cheap.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.467
How can you afford
to order off-menu?

08:26.567 --> 08:27.767
- Well, I'm a trader.

08:27.867 --> 08:32.067
Brokering trades, stock, bonds.

08:32.133 --> 08:33.633
Honestly, I hate Teppanyaki,

08:33.733 --> 08:35.800
but Bosho here
makes the best burger in town.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.933
- You gotta be pretty smart
to do work like that.

08:38.067 --> 08:40.300
- Well, don't wanna
brag on myself.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.900
But people are starting
to take notice.

08:43.067 --> 08:44.567
- Let's say I wanted to invest.

08:44.667 --> 08:45.767
- Uh.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.333
- What would you
tell me to buy?

08:50.367 --> 08:52.167
- [screams]

08:52.267 --> 08:55.200
[groaning]

08:55.300 --> 08:56.600
That's TMI, guy.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.800
- TMI?

08:57.900 --> 08:59.100
We haven't said anything yet.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.067
- No.

09:00.167 --> 09:03.233
Trident Marina Investments, TMI.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.267
It's Coy's company.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.367
He's the boss.

09:05.467 --> 09:09.100
Anything he touches
turns to pure cash.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.900
- It almost sounds
too good to be true.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.400
- That's what
I tell my investors.

09:12.500 --> 09:16.667
- ALL: [laughing]

09:16.767 --> 09:18.133
- So, uh, Ronnie,

09:18.233 --> 09:23.600
why don't you tell me a little
bit more about this Coy?

09:23.700 --> 09:27.933
- * If I never see
your smile again *

09:28.067 --> 09:29.400
*

09:29.500 --> 09:32.700
* Never once touch your skin

09:32.800 --> 09:34.500
- Oh, hell no. Huh-uh.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.400
This ain't working.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.767
What the hell are you doing?

09:37.867 --> 09:40.267
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
I was hitting a groove.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.167
Did you hear that?

09:41.267 --> 09:42.533
- Real groovy, now take a hike!

09:42.633 --> 09:43.633
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

09:43.733 --> 09:45.333
It actually really
did sound pretty good.

09:45.433 --> 09:47.233
I mean, we could just drop
his vocal behind yours.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.067
- Or out in front
where it belongs.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.567
- What are you talking
about, Courtney?

09:50.667 --> 09:51.967
I told you, man,
I wrote this song.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.533
It's real personal to me.
- I know.

09:53.633 --> 09:54.767
- I'm sorry, man.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.600
I hear music, it just
gets my juices flowing.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.900
- I was thinking
about this, Vern.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.033
I was thinking, we could
take this same beat,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.900
put in some island drums,

10:02.000 --> 10:03.767
turn it into a song
for your next album.

10:03.867 --> 10:05.833
- I bet you I could
get Chesney to sing a verse.

10:05.933 --> 10:07.100
- Are you serious?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.800
Hey, man, let's take
this back from the top.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.067
- Hell no.

10:10.167 --> 10:12.100
- Wait, where are you going?
This is good.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.767
Get that, get that, get that.

10:13.867 --> 10:15.067
Let's take it
back from the top.

10:15.167 --> 10:17.133
- No, no, no, man. Now hang on.

10:17.233 --> 10:19.033
Are you here as an actor
or as a musician?

10:19.133 --> 10:20.633
- I don't know now,
I'm confused.

10:20.733 --> 10:22.300
- Well, get back
out of the way, man.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.100
Come on, let's pick up
where we was at.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.800
We don't have time
for anymore distractions.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.133
That's it.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.067
- Did somebody
order a pizza party?

10:29.167 --> 10:30.533
Huh, huh?

10:30.633 --> 10:31.967
Trayne Crowstown?

10:32.067 --> 10:33.500
Wow, I'm a huge fan.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.833
My ex-wife Cynthia and I
used to make so much sweet love

10:36.933 --> 10:38.633
to your album.
- Not now, Doily.

10:38.733 --> 10:39.900
We're in a real
time crunch here.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.700
- Hey, how do we feel
about this Doily?

10:41.800 --> 10:43.467
- [phone ringing]
- Hey, hold on, excuse me.

10:43.567 --> 10:44.800
Hey, Deb.
- What you got here?

10:44.900 --> 10:46.300
- Your pepperoni.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.933
And shrimp and pesto.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.000
- You keep that shrimp
away from me, alright?

10:51.100 --> 10:53.633
I got terrible allergies,
and I'm gonna swell up

10:53.733 --> 10:55.833
like that purple girl
from "Willy Wonka."

10:55.933 --> 10:57.267
- Same thing that
happened to my aunt.

10:57.367 --> 10:58.933
I had to give her
an emergency tracheotomy

10:59.033 --> 11:00.200
with a ballpoint pen.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.300
It was awesome.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.833
- Debbie, not now.
I'm really busy, okay?

11:02.933 --> 11:04.367
But I think you got this.

11:04.467 --> 11:05.633
- Oh, something's up.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.233
Come on, give me, give me.
What is it?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.500
- Charlotte's
in trouble at school,

11:08.600 --> 11:10.767
and they wanna have
a parent-teacher conference.

11:10.867 --> 11:13.067
Told Deb I think she can
handle it by herself.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.667
- Okay, okay,
I'm tracking this.

11:14.767 --> 11:17.467
So we should be more involved
in our daughter's life,

11:17.567 --> 11:19.600
but we push the more
serious stuff onto Debbie.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.733
Am I right?

11:20.833 --> 11:22.667
- Oh hell. I gotta go, y'all.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.333
We'll have to finish
this another time.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.100
- Hey, Vernon, does that mean
I can go

11:26.200 --> 11:27.333
to my antediluvian
alien conference?

11:27.433 --> 11:29.667
- Yeah, go ahead, and go.
- Oh, asking permission?

11:29.767 --> 11:31.467
Now that's a total
sidekick move.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.900
- No, it's not.
- It is to.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.133
- It's not.
- What is this?

11:34.233 --> 11:35.067
[blows air]
- Sidekick.

11:35.133 --> 11:37.400
Oh my God. Thanks, Vern.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.067
- The pryamids were built
nowhere near any source

11:43.133 --> 11:46.900
of the stone blocks.
Facts.

11:47.067 --> 11:51.367
It's impossible
to [unintelligible]. Fact.

11:51.467 --> 11:55.733
The pyramids were built
by extraterrestrial beings.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.067
Fact.

11:57.167 --> 12:00.767
Not humans using
primitive tools.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.100
[laughing]

12:02.200 --> 12:04.733
- [audience applause]

12:07.667 --> 12:10.067
- Isn't there evidence
that the tools discovered

12:10.167 --> 12:12.233
were in fact not primitive?

12:12.333 --> 12:15.167
Potentially utilizing focused
resin sound frequencies,

12:15.267 --> 12:17.067
rending the stones weightless?

12:17.133 --> 12:20.733
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this young lady believes

12:20.833 --> 12:26.333
that humans built the pyramids
using primitive tools.

12:26.433 --> 12:27.767
[laughs]

12:27.867 --> 12:30.167
- Well, the same principles
were used in other secret sites,

12:30.267 --> 12:33.767
such as Stonehenge,
Easter Island, even world--

12:33.867 --> 12:36.633
- You're still talking, hmm?

12:36.733 --> 12:38.067
- She's right.

12:38.167 --> 12:39.467
- Oh, look,
there's another one.

12:39.567 --> 12:42.367
You folks are aware that
this isn't a Q&A, right?

12:42.467 --> 12:44.067
[laughing]

12:44.133 --> 12:46.467
- All those sacred sites
have one thing in common.

12:46.567 --> 12:49.200
The stone being used is made
of a crystalline structure.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.067
Quartz, limestone--

12:51.133 --> 12:54.067
- And this one's
talking gibberish. Mm.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.600
- [audience laughing]

12:55.700 --> 12:58.300
- Okay, let me put it
in laymen's terms for you.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.867
When resident vibrational
frequencies are applied

13:00.067 --> 13:02.700
to crystalline structure,
physicists have theorized that

13:02.800 --> 13:04.633
their core physical properties
can be manipulated.

13:04.733 --> 13:07.333
Even their relationship
to gravitational waves.

13:07.433 --> 13:11.067
It's basic Telsa with a dash of
neonetonial quantum wave theory.

13:11.167 --> 13:14.767
- [audience applause]

13:19.600 --> 13:21.733
- So how are
we gonna play this?

13:21.833 --> 13:24.633
Are we mad at teacher for
messing up our studio time?

13:24.733 --> 13:27.233
Or concerned with the nature
of the meeting?

13:27.333 --> 13:28.733
- Does he really
have to be here?

13:28.833 --> 13:31.133
- Trust me, nobody wants
the son bitch gone more than me,

13:31.233 --> 13:32.433
but he's paying me.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.767
- Thank you
for coming in today.

13:34.867 --> 13:38.300
I wanna discuss some issues
Charlotte's been having.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.333
- I have to be honest,
Ms. Hammon, I didn't know

13:40.433 --> 13:41.633
she was having any problems.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.267
- See, I think I can relate,
Ma'am.

13:43.367 --> 13:45.267
'Cause I never was
that great at school.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.667
I actually learned most
everything I ever knew on tour.

13:47.767 --> 13:48.900
- [whispers] Not helping.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.300
- Not how I would
have played it.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.667
We're such a flawed character.

13:51.767 --> 13:55.433
- Mrs. Cooke, I'm assuming
you didn't write these notes.

13:55.533 --> 13:56.667
- No.

13:56.767 --> 13:59.167
But it is strikingly similar
to my handwriting.

13:59.267 --> 14:00.800
You wanna explain these?

14:00.900 --> 14:04.800
- Charlotte has filled me in
about your situation at home.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.833
I take it these are
the possible fathers?

14:07.933 --> 14:09.067
- No.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.933
He's shadowing him
for--it's a long story.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.633
- Fly on a wall.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.367
- Well, is there possibly
some extra credit she could do

14:16.467 --> 14:18.833
or something she could--test
she could make up?

14:18.933 --> 14:20.867
- Can I jump in here?

14:20.967 --> 14:22.200
I don't wanna intervene,

14:22.300 --> 14:25.467
but these are very trying times
for a teenager.

14:25.567 --> 14:29.467
Especially one from a hectic
household like young Charlotte--

14:29.567 --> 14:32.067
- You don't know anything
about our family, Trayne.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.067
- Well, I know that Debbie
has the very best intentions.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.400
Hell, Vernon probably does, too.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.200
But there's a bigger picture.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.700
Let me explain.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.733
- Can't wait.

14:41.833 --> 14:42.767
- This outta be good.

14:42.867 --> 14:45.533
- The speed
at which change happens

14:45.633 --> 14:48.100
is increasing rapidly
in our lifetime.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.367
[imitating wind]

14:49.467 --> 14:51.467
And because of this,
generational wisdom advice

14:51.567 --> 14:54.500
can no longer
be about everyday things.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.533
Let's keep to broader topics
like mortality and empathy

14:57.633 --> 14:59.433
instead of trying to relate

14:59.533 --> 15:01.767
about texting
and social climates.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.100
- What a load of crap.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.400
- So what you're saying
is the root of our experience

15:06.500 --> 15:09.567
is no longer relevant
to today's children.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.367
Add that with the new baby
with multiple fathers--

15:12.467 --> 15:14.733
- Excuse me, it's
not multiple fathers.

15:14.833 --> 15:16.067
Okay, it's only two.

15:16.167 --> 15:18.233
I mean, only one
of the two is the father.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.167
- This is what
I am dealing with.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.467
- I'm surprised you're doing
as well as you.

15:22.567 --> 15:27.133
- Sometimes, uh, I really wanna
study, but it's really hard

15:27.233 --> 15:28.900
to find a quiet place
around the house.

15:29.067 --> 15:30.233
- A quiet place?

15:30.333 --> 15:31.500
Charlotte, I work most nights.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.100
I mean, you have
the whole house--

15:33.200 --> 15:35.267
- Come and see me
during your lunch.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.200
We can work through your
missed assignments together.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.400
- Thank you so much.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.667
I really do appreciate it.

15:40.767 --> 15:43.133
I guess, in the end, I
just...really need someone

15:43.233 --> 15:45.067
who like actually cares.

15:45.167 --> 15:47.600
- I know you guys
have a hectic life.

15:47.700 --> 15:51.867
But, please, don't let
this young lady down.

15:51.967 --> 15:53.467
- Yes, Ma'am.

15:53.567 --> 15:56.833
As you know, it takes a village.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.133
- COY: Uh, harder.

15:58.233 --> 16:01.400
Oh, yeah, harder, harder.
- Boss.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.433
- Hey, Ronnie.
Come on in, what's on your mind?

16:03.533 --> 16:05.533
- I met these super nice guys
at Chaci Hibachi.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.400
- Bosho!

16:07.500 --> 16:09.933
The meat volcano, deliciouso.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.367
- Yeah, it's so good.

16:11.467 --> 16:12.900
Anyway, they're asking lots
of questions about the company.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.500
Pretty sure I can turn them
into investors.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.133
- Oh, well, good work.

16:16.233 --> 16:19.200
Would you just grab me
the Flex-All 454

16:19.300 --> 16:21.800
out of the drawer there?
- Alright.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.500
They're asking about me, my job,
uh, all sorts of other stuff.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.967
Um, they were even asking about
who runs the company

16:28.067 --> 16:29.567
and other stallions.

16:31.233 --> 16:32.800
- Thank you, Greta.
You can leave.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.600
- *

16:40.867 --> 16:46.200
- I need to know...exactly
what you told these guys.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.867
- Did I do
something wrong, boss?

16:48.967 --> 16:54.700
- You know, I view this company
like my kingdom.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.800
I am the king!

16:56.900 --> 17:00.767
- Oh, it's kinda like that
boobs and dragon show on HBO.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.600
- It's exactly
like that, Ronnie.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.367
- Oh. I mean, I didn't tell 'em
anything.

17:04.467 --> 17:06.200
I just told 'em about
the day-to-day operations

17:06.300 --> 17:07.567
of the company
and how you taught me

17:07.667 --> 17:10.100
how to practically steal money.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.700
- [bell rings]

17:11.800 --> 17:13.700
- I can't believe
she sold us out like that.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.333
She and I are gonna have a very
long talk on the way home.

17:16.433 --> 17:17.800
- Don't go
too hard on her, Deb.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.600
I mean, she did manage to turn
that teacher around

17:19.700 --> 17:20.967
and stay out of trouble.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.933
- Vernon, that's not something
we should be proud of.

17:23.067 --> 17:23.933
- Let me get this right.

17:24.067 --> 17:27.067
So we're "let's be friends"
parents.

17:27.100 --> 17:30.067
The kind that want all kids
to get participation medals.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.267
Got it.

17:31.367 --> 17:32.567
Okay, no wonder
Charlotte' all screwed up.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.633
- I'm done with this.

17:34.733 --> 17:36.633
- Now hold on here, Chief.

17:36.733 --> 17:39.367
You don't have no right
to talk about my daughter.

17:39.467 --> 17:41.533
Besides, this day's about over.

17:41.633 --> 17:43.433
How 'bout you turn over
the rest of that cash?

17:43.533 --> 17:47.367
- Well, Vernon...this
has been very helpful.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.900
I appreciate it. Thank you.

17:50.067 --> 17:53.500
But I feel like you're still
hiding from me.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.200
Come on, Vern. Let me in there.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.900
Let me park
my brand-new 2017 Lambo

17:59.067 --> 18:01.967
in that empty single-car garage
of yours.

18:02.067 --> 18:04.767
- Oh, I've let you
in the garage, son.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.533
But you ain't had a tour
of the dark attic yet.

18:07.633 --> 18:08.867
- What are you saying to me?

18:08.967 --> 18:11.167
- I'm saying you don't know
Vernon Brown

18:11.267 --> 18:12.900
until you know his darkness.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.967
- *

18:19.067 --> 18:20.767
- You will truly
never know Vernon Brown

18:20.867 --> 18:22.600
until you've broken the law.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.633
- I hope to hell
you're being serious,

18:24.733 --> 18:25.700
'cause I freaking love
this idea.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.967
What's the plan?

18:27.067 --> 18:29.067
- Well, if you were me,
which you are,

18:29.167 --> 18:31.067
I would march into that market
right there

18:31.100 --> 18:33.433
and take everything there is
out of the register.

18:33.533 --> 18:37.067
- [laughing]

18:37.133 --> 18:39.067
Give me a gun.
- You don't need no gun, man.

18:39.167 --> 18:40.533
Just put your hand
in your pocket.

18:40.633 --> 18:43.133
Come on, you're an actor.

18:43.233 --> 18:44.867
- I'm doing this.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.733
- [dialing phone]

18:50.833 --> 18:52.633
- Uh, yeah,
I'd like to report a robbery

18:52.733 --> 18:54.533
at the Wedgehill Market.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.067
Uh-huh.

18:56.133 --> 19:00.900
Yeah, white male, blue shirt,
bit overweight, cool style,

19:01.067 --> 19:03.367
but obviously trying too hard.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.733
Okay, thank you very much.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.567
- [engine starts]

19:07.667 --> 19:09.267
- Dumb son of a bitch.

19:09.367 --> 19:12.967
- *

19:19.067 --> 19:21.400
- Whoo-hoo!
I got it! I got it!

19:25.733 --> 19:29.933
- [siren wailing]

19:30.067 --> 19:33.267
- MALE OFFICER: Get out
of the car now!

19:33.367 --> 19:34.367
Get out of the car!

19:34.467 --> 19:37.300
- FEMALE OFFICER Let me
see your hands!

19:37.400 --> 19:40.533
Hands on the car!

19:40.633 --> 19:42.233
- [unintelligible]

19:42.333 --> 19:44.833
- Yeah, looks like we got him.
Matches the description exactly.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.733
- Like hell it does.
- Shut up.

19:47.833 --> 19:48.833
- Oh, yeah, definitely our guy.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.633
He still has the cash on him.

19:50.733 --> 19:52.667
- It's not me.
Trayne's the one you want.

19:52.767 --> 19:55.167
- Shut up!
- Yes, Ma'am.

19:58.233 --> 20:00.800
- The look on his pompous face
was amazing.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.500
You were incredible.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.600
- Well...probably enjoyed
that more than I should have.

20:05.700 --> 20:08.133
- [laughs] Thank you
for sticking up for me.

20:08.233 --> 20:09.000
It meant a lot.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.733
- UTI looks out for their own.

20:10.833 --> 20:12.967
- Membership has
its privileges.

20:13.067 --> 20:14.200
- [laughs]

20:15.767 --> 20:17.633
Hey, are you hungry?

20:17.733 --> 20:20.067
Um, there's a great
Teppanyaki place nearby

20:20.167 --> 20:21.767
that I know about.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.933
- That would be a perfect end
to a great day.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.167
- Cool.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.700
After you.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.000
- Oh, I feel like a princess.
- Princess Leia.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.000
- I don't follow
the royal family.

20:35.467 --> 20:36.900
I'm teasing.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.467
"Return of the Jedi's"
in my top three.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.633
Of course, "Empire" and
"New Hope" being one and two,

20:40.733 --> 20:42.133
respectively.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.267
- Thank God.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.233
- *

20:45.333 --> 20:47.833
- I never needed a drink so bad
in my life.

20:47.933 --> 20:49.333
Thanks for picking me up.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.733
- I can't believe you talked him
into robbing that store.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.067
- Yeah, I'll tell you the truth.

20:53.167 --> 20:54.733
I was just lucky Trayne
had some friends

20:54.833 --> 20:57.533
down at the police department
to explain us out of it.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.633
- Now I know where
Charlotte gets it.

21:00.733 --> 21:02.833
You know, I've just been
so focused on this baby,

21:02.933 --> 21:05.233
I haven't been paying her
enough attention.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.267
- Well, I could pitch in
and pick up the slack.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.067
I mean, seems like
the least I could do.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.800
You growing my baby and all.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.533
- Still don't
know if it's yours.

21:12.633 --> 21:15.300
- Well, I know one thing.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.333
Trayne was right.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.100
Pregnant looks good on you.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.833
- [laughs] Yeah.

21:21.933 --> 21:24.100
You know, I think you make
a much better version of you

21:24.200 --> 21:25.600
than Trayne does.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.067
- You make me
a better version of me.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.567
- That's the sappiest
[bleep] I ever heard.

21:30.667 --> 21:32.733
- *

21:38.600 --> 21:44.367
- * If I never see
your smile again *

21:44.467 --> 21:50.300
* Never want
to touch your skin *

21:50.400 --> 21:55.167
* Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah *

21:55.267 --> 21:58.400
* Cluck, cluck, blah,
blah, blah, blah **

22:01.500 --> 22:03.733
- * Say oh *

22:07.733 --> 22:09.967
- *
