WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:06.740
Previously, on ER:

00:06.740 --> 00:08.609
We got to clean this place up.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.211
Gallant won't be here
for another three days.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.545
I just want it
to be nice for him.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.580
He's been over there
a long time.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.149
Oh. Hi. I'm Zoe.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.518
14 years old?

00:17.518 --> 00:18.819
Why didn't you tell me
how old you are?

00:18.819 --> 00:20.488
'Cause you never asked.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.156
Zoe, I'm going to give
you a prescription

00:22.156 --> 00:23.624
for doxycycline
for the chlamydia.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.227
It's just that you've
been warned three times

00:26.227 --> 00:27.561
and, uh...

00:27.561 --> 00:29.563
We're going to have
to let you go.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.065
Who's this
Clemente guy anyway?

00:31.065 --> 00:32.633
I'm done arguing
with a television set.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.402
It's believed to suppress
radical formation...

00:34.402 --> 00:35.803
Did you just call me
a television set?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.505
Is he gonna be the
new department chief?

00:37.505 --> 00:38.506
We're forming
a search committee.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.840
The guy wouldn't be here

00:39.840 --> 00:41.175
if he wasn't angling for it,
right?

00:49.683 --> 00:52.653
MAN:
You going to
eat your eggs?

00:54.355 --> 00:55.689
They're cold.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.591
What about your waffles?

00:57.591 --> 01:00.594
I'm not hungry.
I got a stomachache.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.731
You want to bring them
home with you?

01:03.731 --> 01:06.334
Mr. Coogy might want
to eat them later.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.302
( sniffing )

01:08.302 --> 01:09.703
He doesn't like waffles.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.611
Um, excuse me.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.147
Can we get the bill, please?

01:19.147 --> 01:21.615
I'm sorry.
Our machine's still out.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.417
WAITRESS:
Would you like
more coffee?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.419
Uh, no. Thanks.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.621
It should be just
a couple of minutes.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.861
Come on. We're gonna
get out of here.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.300
Grab your coat.
Hurry up.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.169
You want your picture?
No.

01:41.169 --> 01:41.902
No, no, this way.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.471
Let's go.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.677
MAN:
You can't come back here, sir.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.179
Hey!

01:57.551 --> 01:59.887
( sighing )

01:59.887 --> 02:01.189
Hey.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.694
I like your picture.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.662
Okay, I think
we should keep it.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.339
( tires screeching )

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.952 --> 02:33.354
No!

02:33.354 --> 02:34.355
No!

02:34.355 --> 02:35.456
Damn!

02:35.456 --> 02:36.457
I'm hit!

02:45.399 --> 02:46.834
Don't move. Stay down.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.305
Easy.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.508
Okay, I'm going to
take care of you.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.644
Try to stay still,
okay?

02:56.644 --> 02:59.347
OFFICER:
I'll call
for another rig.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.482
73, we need backup.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.036
( grunting )

03:56.036 --> 03:57.905
Put him down, Darrel!
Security!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.507
What the hell
are you doing?!

03:59.507 --> 04:01.375
Just checking for
internal bleeding. That's it.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.577
By sticking your
finger in my butt?!

04:03.577 --> 04:05.546
It's called a guiac test.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.548
Oh, geez. Get that
away from me.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.516
Ugh... ugh!

04:08.516 --> 04:10.017
Aah!

04:10.017 --> 04:12.986
DARREL:
Ah, ah! You got
crap on my nose.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.955
Oh, man!
That's horrible!

04:14.955 --> 04:16.890
( gagging ):
Oh!

04:16.890 --> 04:18.024
( groaning ):
Oh! Oh! Oh!

04:18.024 --> 04:19.392
That guy
is terrible!

04:19.392 --> 04:22.330
Somebody give me
a towel! Oh, my God!

04:22.330 --> 04:23.364
Guiac's negative.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.665
( groaning )

04:24.665 --> 04:26.334
Give him two of Ativan.
Make it four.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.502
Has C-spine
and first-day labs.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.670
That's horrible!

04:29.670 --> 04:31.339
I need a tetanus shot!

04:33.341 --> 04:34.608
Yes?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.377
You seen your
buddy KJ around?

04:36.377 --> 04:38.346
Nope.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.046
Me neither.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.781
I'm going to broom him.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.616
What, you can't fire him,
he's a volunteer.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.017
Very involuntary
volunteer.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.686
I need kids
we can count on.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.020
All right,
I'll talk to him.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.357
Okay, okay, okay, kids,
gather around.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.359
It's show time.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.861
Yo, Lockhart, Barnett,
come on, fall in.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.563
You, too, Pratt.

04:55.563 --> 05:00.501
All right, in order to bring
this ER into the 21st century,

05:00.501 --> 05:02.636
we're gonna be introducing
new equipment

05:02.636 --> 05:04.572
and new procedures
on a regular basis.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.475
Now, first up...

05:07.475 --> 05:09.843
my, uh, lovely assistant
will be demonstrating

05:09.843 --> 05:11.078
the Patient Communication board.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.646
No more pens and paper.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.382
This'll make
everyone's
life easier.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.750
From now on, intubated
patients can point, circle

05:16.750 --> 05:18.652
or mark any questions

05:18.652 --> 05:19.820
or requests they have.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.988
Beautifully done.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.056
Next up will be
the Freedom splint.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.858
The federal regulations
are discouraging

05:24.858 --> 05:27.428
the use of wrist restraints,
which, by the way,

05:27.428 --> 05:28.796
should be checked
every ten minutes.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.930
( snickering )

05:33.133 --> 05:34.802
What's so funny, Barnett?

05:34.802 --> 05:38.105
Uh, I just find that
hard to believe.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.808
EVE:
Well, there have been a few
cases of patients left

05:40.808 --> 05:43.611
unattended for few hours
who've lost hands to ischemia.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.046
Therefore, we are going to start
using the Freedom Splint.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.015
Any volunteers?
Volunteers?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.650
CLEMENTE:
Any volunteers?

05:49.650 --> 05:50.884
Hey!

05:50.884 --> 05:52.886
Thank you, Jerry.
All right.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.423
EVE:
The Freedom splint is less
restrictive and should

05:55.423 --> 05:57.758
be used before any
hard or soft restraints.

05:57.758 --> 06:01.094
The splint is very helpful
in preventing

06:01.094 --> 06:03.431
obtunded or
combative patients

06:03.431 --> 06:06.434
from pulling out tubes,
picking at wound sites

06:06.434 --> 06:07.635
and disrupting

06:07.635 --> 06:08.636
life-saving
medical equipment.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.870
Oh, yay.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.873
Oye... mami.
Que sexy.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.974
Thank you.

06:13.974 --> 06:14.942
Thanks.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.644
What's the occasion?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.712
Playboy doing a "Girls
of the ER" edition?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.047
Bugger off, Frank.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.450
You do look very nice.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.784
Michael's coming
home today.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.586
Well, hello, soldier.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.456
Vic, Big Darrel just put his
head through the supply cabinet!

06:28.456 --> 06:30.057
Well, give him five
of Haldol.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.625
Wait, make it ten.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.993
But the guy's like
a rogue elephant.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.762
Do you shoot it
from a tranquilizer gun?

06:34.762 --> 06:35.729
We got one of those?

06:35.729 --> 06:36.830
That was just a joke.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.632
Hey, X-Ray, you and me,

06:38.632 --> 06:40.000
come on, tag team--
you distract him,
I'll shoot him.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.469
Distract him
with what?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.571
You pretend to be
a rodeo clown.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.805
Come on, do something.
You go first.

06:46.674 --> 06:49.076
Heads up, guys.
Multiple GSWs coming in.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.210
Abby, you're with me.
Neela, call the OR.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.845
Make sure the
suite is open.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.547
Pratt, you prepare Trauma
One and Trauma Two.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.615
I'll clear out the rooms.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.849
Frank, hold
the blood bank!

06:55.849 --> 06:57.651
Tell them we're gonna
need some O-neg!

06:57.651 --> 06:59.520
Okay.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.788
Is this a gang shooting?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.223
Father used his daughter
as a human shield.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.558
Ah, lovely.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.726
Yeah.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.495
Well, you missed
show-and-tell.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.228
Huh?

07:08.228 --> 07:09.630
Clemente is
implementing

07:09.630 --> 07:11.131
some changes and
new equipment.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.134
Think they're going to
make him head of the ER?

07:14.134 --> 07:15.669
That's what
they were saying.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.237
Look, the guy who got you
and Neela suspended

07:17.237 --> 07:18.071
for working
on a monkey?

07:18.071 --> 07:19.707
It was a chimp.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.842
Well, if he wants the Chief
position, he can have it.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.077
Maybe he can open a petting zoo
in the doctor's lounge.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.946
Ten-year-old,
single GSW to the right chest!

07:25.946 --> 07:28.215
BP: 85/60.
Pulse: 120.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.617
Pulse ox?
96 on two liters.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.718
What's your name?

07:30.718 --> 07:31.685
Vincent calls me Mezoti.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.053
Who's Vincent?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.088
Guy she was with.
She's a kidnapping victim.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.590
Her father started shooting.
We returned fire.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.525
You shot her?

07:37.525 --> 07:39.259
No. I had a clean shot,

07:39.259 --> 07:42.062
but the guy's gun must have
discharged when he went down.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.597
Is Vincent dead?

07:43.597 --> 07:45.098
PICKMAN:
73's bringing him in.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.034
Guy got popped a bunch of times,
at least once in the head.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.068
He shot one
of our guys.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.603
You got this?
ABBY:
Yeah.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.539
Okay, I'll go with
for the next one.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.040
Come on. Let's get
you fixed up, okay?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.575
GIRL:
It really hurts.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.809
ABBY:
I know. We're
going to make it

07:55.809 --> 07:57.745
stop hurting
real soon, okay?

07:57.745 --> 07:59.547
I lost Coogy.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.581
Who's Coogy?

08:00.581 --> 08:01.849
My stuffed puppy.

08:01.849 --> 08:02.950
Maybe the police found him.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.652
I'm sure
he's okay.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.186
One's open. Blood's on its way.
You need a hand?

08:06.186 --> 08:08.556
No, I think we got
this. Thank you, Sam.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.592
SAM:
Hi.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.993
Nice mustache.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.062
Ian Summerlin.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.697
Your buddies do that?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.832
I wouldn't call
them my buddies,

08:18.832 --> 08:22.069
but, uh, yeah, uh, we live
in the same dorm.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.904
Freshman?

08:23.904 --> 08:24.938
How'd you guess?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.574
( chuckles softly )

08:26.574 --> 08:27.875
I thought campus life
was supposed to be fun.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.644
If you like being tortured.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.979
You've been vomiting?

08:31.979 --> 08:34.181
Yeah, I puked all night.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.749
Keg party?

08:35.749 --> 08:38.251
Passed out, woke up
with a bad hangover

08:38.251 --> 08:40.220
and a magic-
marker facial?

08:40.220 --> 08:41.789
Something like that.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.624
Okay, well, you don't
have a fever,

08:43.624 --> 08:45.593
so it's probably not viral.

08:45.593 --> 08:49.797
Your BP is a little low, which
means you're maybe dehydrated.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.198
All right, thank you.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.767
Um, what if I have
to puke again?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.836
Ah. Here you go.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.606
Uh, you got anything
a little bigger?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.142
Well, if it isn't
the hatchet lady!

09:02.142 --> 09:05.713
Which beloved employee
are you axing today?

09:05.713 --> 09:07.247
Stick a sock in it, Frank.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.349
I'm sending Haleh
her last check.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.084
You want to
include a note?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.252
Haleh was Eve's idea.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.787
I was just
following orders.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.623
That's what Himmler said.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.826
You got a letter here somewhere
from your jailbird boyfriend.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.629
Yeah, probably marrying
his cellmate.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.799
BARDELLI:
Jimmy Howe, 25!

09:25.799 --> 09:26.934
Grazing GSW to
the upper arm

09:26.934 --> 09:28.001
with a lot of
blood loss!

09:28.001 --> 09:29.803
Have no fear.
Dr. Pratt is here.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.238
This isn't
the shooter?
No, this is
the cop he shot.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.973
Oh, this is my first week
riding solo.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.307
I just got out
of the academy.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.009
Looks like the bullet
snuck up under his vest.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.678
I thought the other guy
had more critical injuries.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.846
We just took
what they told us.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.681
BP: 100/65.
Pulse: 120.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.215
Must have bagged
the brachial artery.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.717
I can't feel my hand.
Median nerve, too.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.152
Oh, am I going to lose my arm?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.720
No. The bleeding will stop.
We can repair the artery.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.055
You okay with this?
Yup.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.322
I'm to go check on Abby.
I'm all over it.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.824
Hey, where you been?
Doing stuff.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.660
I'm going to do some
stuff on your head.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.127
We need O-neg
from the blood bank. Go, now!

09:54.127 --> 09:57.264
I've never seen him
move that fast.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.331
I can't move my hand.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.000
You might have
bruised the nerve.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.702
( groans )
RAY:
What's this?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.705
Penetrating axillary trauma
with neurovascular deficit.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.873
You want to clamp
the bleeder?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.407
Only if we can
visualize it.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.876
Oh, I'm getting dizzy.
Don't let me die, man.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.877
Hey, you're not going to die.

10:09.877 --> 10:10.944
Please don't let me die.

10:10.944 --> 10:11.979
Hey, you with the 23rd?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.881
What? Yeah.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.048
Ready? one, two, three!

10:15.048 --> 10:17.217
( grunting )

10:17.217 --> 10:19.853
My father and brother are
with the 17th and the 109.

10:19.853 --> 10:20.988
Really?

10:20.988 --> 10:22.690
Uh-huh.
You know Joe Buchitelli?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.257
Yeah. He helped me
through the academy.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.292
He's your brother?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.060
No, he gave me my first orgasm.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.161
( Jimmy groans )

10:28.161 --> 10:30.630
Hey, it was a milestone.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.234
ROBO-DUBENKO:
How's his pulse ox?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.969
Holding at 92.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.771
And what's the status
on the other patients?

10:37.771 --> 10:40.140
Uh, Pratt's got a cop
with a grazing GSW

10:40.140 --> 10:41.408
to the upper arm,

10:41.408 --> 10:42.876
and there's another victim
en route.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.912
All right,
I'm on my way down.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.980
The station confirmed her ID.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.116
Her name's Sydney Carlyle.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.918
She was abducted
in a campsite

10:50.918 --> 10:52.753
from upstate New York in August.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.990
Is your real name Sydney?

10:58.926 --> 10:59.960
It's okay.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.028
You can tell me.

11:04.832 --> 11:05.833
Yes.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.300
Yeah.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.937
You're gonna have to do
a rape exam.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.872
I'll open a kit.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.811
Sydney... we're going to check
between your legs, okay?

11:17.811 --> 11:20.814
Is Vincent dead?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.916
YAU:
Vincent Jansen...
the creep who took her.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.852
I don't know.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.319
They shot him.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.088
KOVAC:
How big's
the pneumothorax?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.422
Abby...

11:37.765 --> 11:42.069
Multiple abrasions adjacent
to the external genitalia.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.171
Four lacerations
to the labia

11:44.171 --> 11:46.306
in various stages
of healing.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.191
Did Vincent hurt you?

12:06.894 --> 12:11.231
Did he touch you
in your private parts?

12:11.231 --> 12:15.903
Only when we play
the married game.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.305
Vincent loves me.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.142
MARQUEZ:
Systolics down to 70.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.811
Hey, the shooter's here.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.184
Thinking about
a chest tube?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.221
Abby?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.122
Yeah? What?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.423
Chest tube.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.559
Yeah, they're processing
the film.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.128
Okay. Don't wait.
Just do it now.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.195
Right.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.165
Betadine and steridrapes.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.867
ZADRO:
Vincent Jansen, 34,

12:46.867 --> 12:48.201
multiple GSWs to the chest
and abdomen.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.202
GATES:
And one through
the melon.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.337
You didn't intubate him?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.105
Spontaneous resps,
sating at 96.

12:52.105 --> 12:52.973
He needs two IVs.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.574
Full up.
Exam 2.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.076
How's the little girl?
I think she's stable.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.244
Hi, I'm Tony Gates.
Dr. Rasgotra.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.946
BP's at 100 palp
after a liter.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.081
You should have
needled the chest.
We scooped and ran.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.116
He's bleeding out!
This guy shot a bullet
through our windshield.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.852
Almost blew Gates' head off.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.854
It's true. I saw my life
flash before my eyes.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.288
I think we were on a beach.
Stop it! Can
we focus here?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.556
I lost the radial pulse.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.524
He needs two chest tubes
and a central line

13:11.524 --> 13:13.360
and call for four units
of O-neg.
Yowza, look
at that head shot.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.328
This guy's gonna need
a couple chest tubes
and a central...

13:15.328 --> 13:18.565
Isn't that your patient?
What, that? I could do
with my eyes closed.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.333
It's probably best
if you didn't.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.902
I'll call you
if I need help.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.403
Yeah, you'll call me.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.538
His head could roll off,
you wouldn't call me.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.075
110/70.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.109
Is that good?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.110
Couldn't be better.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.012
Just sliding off
the vest.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.882
PRATT:
Damn.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.350
Okay, we need to lift up
your arm and take a look.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.118
( groans )

13:38.118 --> 13:39.286
Whoa! Got it.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.153
Oh, God.
I'm bleeding out.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.021
No, you're not.

13:41.021 --> 13:41.554
Hey, Jimmy, look at me.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.090
Look at me.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.358
Is Marty Stats still
the desk sergeant at the 23?

13:45.358 --> 13:47.460
What? Yeah.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.162
He used to baby-sit me.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.630
You know he's got a metal plate
in his head?

13:50.630 --> 13:51.932
PRATT:
I need a procedural tray.

13:51.932 --> 13:52.933
Okay, right away.

13:52.933 --> 13:53.901
Oh, what's happening?

13:53.901 --> 13:54.567
Sterile gloves, please.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.336
What's happening?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.139
We need to clamp the artery
you severed.
Oh, man.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.207
Can I steal your hemocue?

14:00.207 --> 14:01.508
Help yourself.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.643
Eve, you want me
to take over for you?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.012
Sure.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.079
Yeah, that would be good.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.115
I gotta go check on the others.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.986
Hang in there, Jimmy.
I'll be right back.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.089
Cut, please.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.926
Did they find Coogy?

14:18.926 --> 14:20.093
Who is that?

14:20.093 --> 14:22.062
Um, her stuffed animal.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.931
He's a puppy.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.399
Yeah.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.500
Great, hang on.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.969
I got her mom.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.304
Okay.
Vaseline gauze dressing on that.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.343
Hi, Mrs. Carlyle.
This is Abby Lockhart,

14:36.343 --> 14:38.645
I'm treating
your daughter.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.646
Uh, yes,

14:39.646 --> 14:41.048
she was shot
in the chest,

14:41.048 --> 14:42.315
but we're doing
all we can for her

14:42.315 --> 14:43.650
and she's doing well.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.053
She's a very brave
little girl.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.656
Sure.
Just a minute.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.458
200cc's in the thoraseal.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.062
It's your mom.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.098
Mom?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.973
I miss you, too.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.275
( sobs ):
I am.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.377
Yeah.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.046
I will.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.183
I love you, too.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.217
Okay.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.488
I'm going to give you
back to the police now.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.123
We have to continue treating
your daughter.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.424
But we'll see you
in a couple of hours.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.994
Okay.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.362
Mrs. Carlyle,
Officer Yau.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.300
It's okay, Sydney.
You're safe now.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.335
Your parents are
coming to get you.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.037
Nobody can hurt you here.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.471
What about Vincent?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.407
You don't have to worry
about him anymore.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.009
How's the chest tube output?

15:42.009 --> 15:44.077
Less than 500cc's.
Small hemothorax.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.346
Good. Should be able to manage
her conservatively.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.547
Hey, nice lid.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.416
You get a free bowl
of soup with that?

15:49.416 --> 15:51.284
Pressure's down: 80/50.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.719
Okay, call for
type-specific

15:52.719 --> 15:54.121
and run in 500
of saline.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.422
No, let's not.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.657
Hi there.
I'm Dr. Clemente.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.726
We're going to put
a little glop on your belly,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.495
then I'm going to take this
camera to look inside, okay?

16:02.495 --> 16:05.632
Are you the little princess
I heard was coming this morning?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.635
I'm not a princess.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.403
She's hypotensive.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.771
Hypotensive can be
a good thing.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.140
What are you
talking about?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.507
Leave her systolic at 80.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.476
Right, Dr. Dubenko?
Right.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.778
Permissive hypotension.
Landmark papers
by Bickell and Mattox.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.547
When you have a vascular injury

16:20.547 --> 16:22.582
you need a low pressure
to stabilize the clots.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.451
You blast away
with blood and fluids,

16:24.451 --> 16:26.619
you raise the pressure
and blow out the clot.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.755
Lots of sub-q air
in the chest wall,

16:28.755 --> 16:30.590
but the belly is dry.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.293
Okay, well, we never allow
the pressures to drift this low.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.794
So I'm checking with Kovac.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.430
Abby, the chief of surgery
agrees with our plan.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.502
We're going to make you
brand-new,

16:42.502 --> 16:44.604
all right,
sweetie pie?

16:44.604 --> 16:45.338
KOVAC:
Okay, I'm in.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.573
Hooking it up.

16:46.573 --> 16:50.277
Sounds like tension
pneumo here.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.711
O-Silk...

16:51.711 --> 16:53.513
and Xeroform next.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.482
Five centimeters
in the thoraseal.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.750
Pressure's up.
120/70.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.352
Excellent.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.354
He just needs a little blood
to his brain.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.455
Nice work.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.627
I heard Gallant's home on leave.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.529
I didn't get a chance
to see him last time.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.598
Actually, he gets home today.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.599
Hopefully he'll be here longer
this time.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.636
Well, tell him to stop by.
I'll buy him a beer.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.708
Hey, this guy
just looked at me.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.810
4x4s and elastoplast.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.412
He's got spontaneous
eye opening.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.713
( yells )

17:26.713 --> 17:28.648
Lie back down!
Son of a bitch!

17:28.648 --> 17:30.450
Stop! You have tubes
in your chest!

17:30.450 --> 17:31.751
Push four of versed.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.654
Stop it. You're hurting me!

17:34.654 --> 17:36.589
No! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

17:36.589 --> 17:38.725
Neela!
( yells )
I'm trying.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.301
( sighs heavily )

17:51.504 --> 17:53.140
You okay?
Yeah.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.242
I guess his head injury
wasn't as bad as it looks.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.743
It's a clean
frontal lobe injury.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.378
No vital functions are affected,

17:58.378 --> 18:00.213
but he will have ongoing
impulse control problems.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.181
Wh-Where's Sydney?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.615
Safe from you.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.284
( whining ):
I didn't hurt her.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.618
I took care of her.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.387
You raped her.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.556
You don't understand.
I need to see her, please.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.523
Okay?

18:10.523 --> 18:11.758
Sydney!
Shut up.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.393
Oh, God, I didn't do
anything wrong.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.761
Sounds like the lung is back up.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.697
You think you know me,
but you don't.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.467
She loves me.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.634
Not much blood
from the chest.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.669
It's all
in the belly.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.804
She needed me.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.739
( softly ):
She wanted me.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.208
Looks like hemoperitoneum.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.376
Yeah, and a grade 4
hepatic injury.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.777
Grade 4?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.213
AKA chopped liver.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.781
JANSEN:
I know what you're thinking.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.416
You want me to die.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.218
I want you to shut up.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.652
MALIK:
Tachy at 120.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.920
Hemocue is eight.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.355
Okay, transfuse
another two units.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.323
How soon can he go

18:43.323 --> 18:44.857
to the OR?
No vacancy.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.693
I can turn over a room
in 20 minutes.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.694
KOVAC:
Okay, you've got ten.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.262
Have the blood bank

18:49.262 --> 18:51.731
stay ahead four units.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.633
Maybe you should
just let me die.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.205
BARNETT:
A little more exposure?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.773
Sure. Suction?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.342
I got your blood.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.743
Great, thanks.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.512
Give it to her
and get your butt over here.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.513
More 4x4s, Ray?

19:06.513 --> 19:07.514
BARNETT:
Read my mind.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.448
Can you visualize the brachial?

19:08.448 --> 19:09.649
I'm working on it.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.618
Eve was complaining
about you today.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.353
I don't even know
who that is.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.321
TAGGART:
The nurse manager.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.622
Tall blonde.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.224
Oh, yeah,
that Amazon?

19:17.224 --> 19:18.425
She doesn't like me.
Hey, show some respect!

19:18.425 --> 19:19.626
This is her turf,

19:19.626 --> 19:21.294
and you're damn lucky
to be here.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.762
You want to do the rest
of your community service

19:22.762 --> 19:24.364
in some smelly-ass soup kitchen?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.232
Well, do you?!

19:25.232 --> 19:26.766
No.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.635
Well, you'd better
get your act together then.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.936
Okay, there it is.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.738
Okay, ease up
on the gauze.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.805
( all shouting )

19:32.805 --> 19:34.274
Sorry about that.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.908
Proximal pressure.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.977
I'm telling you, I hear
one more complaint about you,

19:37.977 --> 19:40.613
and your ass is...

19:40.613 --> 19:43.283
That's one hell of a pep talk.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.751
Let's get a gurney in here!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.719
How much saline
has she had?

19:46.719 --> 19:47.720
Very little. It's TKO.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.921
MARQUEZ:
BP is 80 palp.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.757
Why aren't you
giving her fluids?

19:50.757 --> 19:52.592
Permissive hypotension-- don't
want to disrupt hemostasis.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.428
When is she
going to the OR?
Waiting to hear from them.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.629
You can't do
permissive hypotension

19:56.629 --> 19:57.764
without a
definitive plan.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.566
Abby, give her
a liter wide open.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.934
No, look, I've had experience
with this, and it works.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.770
I don't want our residents
put in the position

20:03.770 --> 20:06.373
of using unproven therapies
on critical patients.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.541
Dr. Kovac,
we need you back in here.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.877
KOVAC:
Get her pressure up
to 100 systolic.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.011
PEREZ:
Dr. Clemente.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.746
Just a minute, please.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.816
Well, CT's calling about
your patient Darrel Insley.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.885
Yeah, so what did
Big Darrel do now?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.453
He stopped breathing.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.390
And why the hell
would he do that?

20:23.390 --> 20:26.593
Don't give a fluid bolus
unless the MAP drops below 70.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.800
BP's down to 60 palp.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.368
Where are we
on the packed cells?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.403
Units three and four.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.437
Hang another two.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.705
Mr. Jansen?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.006
Vincent, can you hear me?!

20:40.006 --> 20:41.474
Sux and etomidate,
8-0 tube.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.443
How fast we can
get him upstairs?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.678
Won't have an OR
for at least ten minutes.
Move him to pre-op.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.013
He'll bleed out in the elevator.

20:47.013 --> 20:50.016
Our job is to save lives,
not judge them.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.852
Death is the
easy way out.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.621
He deserves to rot in jail.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.556
RASGOTRA:
I'm in. Bag him.

20:58.891 --> 20:59.792
KOVAC:
What are you doing?

20:59.792 --> 21:00.927
Exploratory laparotomy.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.462
Here? Now?

21:02.462 --> 21:04.564
Sterile drapes, cut-down tray,
masks and gowns.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.965
Scrub in, Neela.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.467
You want to save
this guy?

21:07.467 --> 21:09.669
It's the only way
I know how.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.908
Sydney?

21:15.908 --> 21:17.076
Come on, honey.

21:17.076 --> 21:20.079
Come on, baby.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.848
Hey, Luka!

21:21.848 --> 21:23.483
Sydney...

21:23.483 --> 21:25.518
Come on, Sydney.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.455
Come on.
Let's stay awake.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.423
Say hi to your mom and dad, huh?

21:30.423 --> 21:31.458
Sydney.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.360
Somebody get Kovac in here.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.562
Tachy to 150,
BP not registering.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.663
LOCKHART:
Starting CPR.
Can't get a pulse.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.597
What do you need?
Help.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.366
She's going down.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.601
Squeeze in the saline and
give me two units packed cells.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.503
You did type and cross her,
didn't you?
Of course I did.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.037
Where is she bleeding?
I don't know.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.973
Chest tube slowed down
at 300cc's, belly was clean.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.575
You need to stay ahead
of a patient like this.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.942
My attending felt otherwise.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.111
I'm the attending now.
Prep the chest.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.781
If she doesn't come
back with a saline
bolus, we'll crack her.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.715
I was just talking...

21:55.715 --> 21:56.916
Go ahead and intubate.

21:56.916 --> 22:00.687
6-0, ET, and suction.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.589
Okay, got it.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.123
Well, here goes nothing.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.558
All right.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.759
Looking good,
dry as a bone.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.727
Okay, moist 4x4s.

22:07.727 --> 22:08.595
Let down
the Weitlaners.

22:08.595 --> 22:09.829
Did you save my arm?

22:09.829 --> 22:10.730
PRATT:
Yeah, the bleeding
is controlled.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.031
You got this
from here?

22:12.031 --> 22:12.865
Piece of cake.
I'll keep my eye on him.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.767
Dry Kerlix, please.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.470
Okay, what's his damage?
One and half centimeter
scalp lac.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.038
Am I going
to have a scar?

22:19.038 --> 22:20.907
PRATT:
Nothing anybody
would be able to see.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.542
What if I shaved
my head?

22:22.542 --> 22:24.511
Not such a good idea--
not with that helmet.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.845
Two to three staples
ought to do it.

22:25.845 --> 22:26.846
Okay, I got this.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.681
I never fainted before.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.817
It's probably the best thing
you could have done today.

22:30.817 --> 22:31.951
What do you mean?

22:31.951 --> 22:33.686
Eve was going
to give you the boot.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.489
Now she'll probably let you stay
just out of pity.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.658
Hold still.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.059
Ow!

22:40.059 --> 22:41.561
Yeah, that's going
to burn a little.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.529
It got a little
tricky,

22:42.529 --> 22:43.730
but he's a tough kid.

22:43.730 --> 22:44.864
He's going to be
just fine, okay?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.599
Good to see you.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.670
I'll come find you guys
when I have more details.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.072
Got a thing for
the boys in blue, huh?

22:53.072 --> 22:55.508
No. I know
half of them.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.009
My dad was as cop,
retired.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.845
My brother, fiance...

22:58.845 --> 23:00.547
You're engaged?

23:00.547 --> 23:01.948
I was--
a few years ago.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.083
He was killed
on the job.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.051
I'm so sorry.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.953
Thanks.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.121
Still have a thing
for that uniform
though, you know.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.957
Yeah.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.525
Can I ask you
a question?

23:12.525 --> 23:13.760
Sure.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.928
Under what circumstances
would a prisoner

23:15.928 --> 23:17.830
be transferred from
one state to another?

23:17.830 --> 23:19.198
Your ex?

23:19.198 --> 23:21.167
He wrote me a letter
saying he's being moved

23:21.167 --> 23:22.935
from Cañon City in Colorado
to Cook County.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.471
There could be
a lot of reasons,

23:24.471 --> 23:26.205
but I can check
it out for you.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.207
Thanks.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.810
Sam, this man
is looking

23:30.810 --> 23:32.144
for Dr. Rasgotra.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.580
She's with a patient.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.882
That's what I told him.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.017
Dad, please,
can we just go...
Zoe...

23:38.017 --> 23:40.587
Excuse me, I want
to talk this
doctor right now.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.789
Yeah, well, you're
going to have to wait,

23:42.789 --> 23:44.491
unless I can help you.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.892
She wrote this prescription
for my daughter,

23:45.892 --> 23:47.159
and I want to know why.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.861
Doesn't your daughter know?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.129
She won't tell me.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.064
Dad, you're making a scene...
Shh.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.200
Well, if your daughter
won't tell you, sir,

23:54.200 --> 23:55.935
there's nothing
that we can do about it.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.070
Excuse me.
Yes, there is.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.172
You can get this
damn doctor for me

24:00.172 --> 24:03.510
right now, before I hit
this whole place with
a malpractice suit.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.611
I've got
lawyers, lady.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.513
Yeah? Well, I've got Jerry.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.848
So unless you want to
be carried out of here
like a dirty diaper,

24:08.848 --> 24:11.217
I suggest you take a seat.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.986
( sighs )

24:13.986 --> 24:15.522
Come on, Zoe.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.691
Thanks.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.093
You know,
I abhor violence.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.529
Yeah, I know that.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.730
But he doesn't.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.698
So put on your best
tough guy face.

24:29.736 --> 24:30.837
Here we go.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.672
From the xiphoid

24:32.672 --> 24:35.174
to the symphysis pubis.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.943
What kind of retractor
do you need?

24:36.943 --> 24:37.977
The human kind.

24:40.046 --> 24:43.282
Lots of exposure.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.784
What's this?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.252
Linea alba.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.855
Straight through it
to the pre-peritoneal fat.

24:48.855 --> 24:49.756
Retract
the deep fascia.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.023
Got it.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.559
JERRY:
Neela, you
got a call

24:52.559 --> 24:54.160
on line one.
Sounds urgent.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.862
Take a message.
You need scissors?

24:55.862 --> 24:57.597
No.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.032
Poke a finger through
the peritoneum and tear it open.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.168
It's from a Lieutenant
Strickland.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.604
He's calling from
Camp Claiborne
in Iraq.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.038
Okay, stand back.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.577
Oh, God.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.044
Can't take it, Jerry.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.212
Get a number.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.280
Okay, suction.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.717
Lap pads.

25:17.717 --> 25:18.985
LOCKHART:
She's not responding to fluids.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.887
She's in PEA.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.221
Brady to 60.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.156
10 blade to Abby.
Rib spreader to me.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.959
I'm not really used
to doing this on kids.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.228
Pretty much the same.
It's just everything's smaller.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.675
The pleura is dry.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.243
Check the pericardium.

25:47.614 --> 25:50.983
Oh, my God,
it's full of blood. Really full.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.284
Damn it. She's in tamponade.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.753
LOCKHART:
Too much pressure
on the heart.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.755
She's collapsed
her ventricles.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.824
Pick up and metz.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.799
Where's Clemente?

26:11.070 --> 26:12.204
Three lap pads around
the suprahepatic space.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.239
Three around Morrison's.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.641
And the liver is packed off.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.142
Eight units in.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.977
Pressure's up
to 90 systolic.
That'll do.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.311
OR's ready.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.213
Okay, it helps
to compress the liver

26:21.213 --> 26:22.982
up against the diaphragm.

26:22.982 --> 26:23.883
That was brilliant.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.384
Another five minutes

26:25.384 --> 26:27.720
and we would have been
taking him to the morgue.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.921
Let's go.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.356
Sorry about your floor.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.295
LOCKHART:
Ready for another unit?

26:36.295 --> 26:38.665
What the hell happened?

26:38.665 --> 26:40.199
Cardiac tamponade.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.802
That's impossible.
It was a peripheral wound.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.270
You know a bullet's trajectory
can go anywhere.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.738
She had a hemothorax.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.306
She was only bleeding
in the chest.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.908
No, she was bleeding
into the pericardium.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.176
The pressure kept
her heart from filling.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.811
CLEMENTE:
That's impossible.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.412
There was no indication
of tamponade.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.048
Didn't you check for effusion
on the ultrasound?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.249
Of course,
but there was sub-Q air.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.018
I couldn't get a clear view.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.887
KOVAC:
She needed volume
to fill her ventricle

27:00.887 --> 27:01.988
and you withheld
fluids.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.890
Based on what we knew,

27:03.890 --> 27:05.825
permissive hypotension
was reasonable.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.293
You killed her.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.730
Um, her parents are coming here
to take her home.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.868
They think
she was rescued.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.737
Can we keep her alive
until they get here?

27:17.737 --> 27:19.271
Okay, let's cross clamp
the aorta.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.073
She's not bleeding
in her belly. She's gone.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.310
Well, this will help
perfuse her heart and brain

27:24.310 --> 27:25.712
until we get
more blood into her.

27:25.712 --> 27:26.913
Vascular clamp.

27:28.715 --> 27:29.982
Vascular clamp!

27:37.323 --> 27:39.926
Dr. Rasgotra, what's the word
on that little girl?

27:39.926 --> 27:41.427
They're still working on her.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.229
The guy you brought in
is going to pull through.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.463
I wish it was
the other way around.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.998
Well, at least
child molesters

27:45.998 --> 27:47.266
don't last long
in prison, right?

27:48.467 --> 27:51.203
Are you a 'Hawks fan?

27:51.203 --> 27:52.071
Excuse me?

27:52.071 --> 27:52.872
Chicago Blackhawks.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.807
Hockey.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.776
I have two tickets
to Friday's game
against the Kings.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.010
You interested?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.279
You, me, hot wings,
cold beer?

28:00.279 --> 28:02.081
Sorry.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.183
You more of a theater gal?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.952
See, I figured as much.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.754
I also have tickets
to the opera and
the Philharmonic.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.789
You moonlight
as a scalper?

28:09.789 --> 28:11.223
No. Actually,
my cousin does.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.892
You know, I appreciate
the offer,

28:12.892 --> 28:14.026
but I don't get
much time off.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.494
Oh, yeah, I know that story.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.096
Well, you know what.
We'll just stay home.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.965
We'll stay home.
Order a deep dish.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.867
You can quiz me
on renal pathophysiology.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.334
And what do you know about
renal pathophysiology?

28:22.334 --> 28:24.336
Not enough.
That's why I
need your help.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.372
It's one of my
fourth-year electives.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.473
Fourth year of what?

28:27.473 --> 28:29.275
Medical school.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.177
I just do this
for the free coffee.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.046
Maybe some other time.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.882
I'm sorry. I have to deal
with something really urgent.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.785
No problem.
I'll see you around.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.220
Doc.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.789
Jerry, do you have that

28:42.789 --> 28:43.322
Lieutenant's phone
number for me?

28:43.322 --> 28:44.791
Yeah.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.525
Didn't say what
it was about?

28:46.525 --> 28:47.794
Sorry.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.331
You have something
sarcastic to say, Frank?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.966
No.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.373
MAN:
Hey.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.944
Hey, is this you?
Dr. Rasgotra?

29:04.944 --> 29:06.813
Yes.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.047
Great.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.916
You mind telling me
what these are for?

29:09.916 --> 29:11.818
See the patient's name
below mine on the bottle?

29:11.818 --> 29:13.519
That's who the prescription
is for.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.421
Unless you're Zoe Butler,
I can't tell you anything.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.423
Look, if you treated
my daughter,

29:17.423 --> 29:19.425
I need to know why.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.860
I'm sorry, sir.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.094
There are
confidentiality rules.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.262
Confidentiality?!

29:23.262 --> 29:24.997
She's a little kid.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.299
You didn't have my permission
to treat her.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.968
You know what?
I want to see your supervisor.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.369
Dad, let's go.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.904
He won't tell you
anything different.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.339
In these situations, we...

29:33.339 --> 29:34.573
What situations?

29:34.573 --> 29:37.076
Is she pregnant?
Is she using drugs?

29:37.076 --> 29:39.278
What? I'm her father.
I have a right to know.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.280
Dad, please.
If you want
information,

29:41.280 --> 29:44.350
it has to come
from Zoe, not from me.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.517
Excuse me.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.853
I'm Dr. Barnett.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.187
I've...

29:48.187 --> 29:48.888
got this.

29:48.888 --> 29:49.421
You the boss?

29:49.421 --> 29:51.190
Ray...

29:51.190 --> 29:54.226
Yeah, um, Mr. Butler,
my name is Ray Barnett,

29:54.226 --> 29:55.394
and the thing is...

29:55.394 --> 29:57.296
I need to speak
with you in private.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.998
Neela...
Ray...

29:58.998 --> 30:00.299
Let me deal with this.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.367
No.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.139
You know, I can
handle this.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.440
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.541
How?

30:09.541 --> 30:11.277
By talking to him?

30:11.277 --> 30:13.312
Telling him his daughter has
a sexually transmitted disease?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.247
Because if you do, it's
a breach of confidentiality.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.183
Look, I just want
to do the right thing.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.018
Now you want to violate
her privacy, too?

30:19.018 --> 30:21.487
What you did
is a crime, Ray.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.989
If you tell him the truth,
you'll go to jail.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.390
You know that, right?

30:24.390 --> 30:26.525
Best thing you can do

30:26.525 --> 30:29.095
is just let it go
and allow me to deal with this.

30:33.399 --> 30:34.533
CLEMENTE:
Clear.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.434
LOCKHART:
Asystole.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.203
Resume compressions.

30:37.203 --> 30:40.339
See if you can find a hole
in the right ventricle.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.074
Did she have
a high-dose epi?

30:42.074 --> 30:43.342
Five minutes ago.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.511
If there's a cardiac
injury to occlude,

30:45.511 --> 30:47.980
we'll get better
ventricular filling.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.448
Pulseless V-fib and asystole
for 25 minutes.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.051
Still not perfusing
with open compressions.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.552
I'm giving her
another chance.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.454
All you're giving her
is more abuse.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.423
Stop it.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.625
Just stop it.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.079
3:49.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.123
I'll sew up the chest
before the family gets here.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.247
MAN:
Camp Claiborne.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.317
Hello, I'm trying to reach
a Lieutenant Strickland, please.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.987
Can I ask your name
and what this is regarding?

32:00.987 --> 32:03.155
Neela Rasgotra.
I'm returning his call.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.657
One moment, ma'am.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.526
Come on.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.427
Miss Rasgotra?

32:08.427 --> 32:09.328
Yes?

32:09.328 --> 32:11.097
Lieutenant Strickland.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.165
I understand you're a friend
of Michael Gallant.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.500
Yes, yes, I am.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.168
Well, I have some bad news,
ma'am.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.604
There was an incident
outside of Mosul.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.375
Hello?

32:23.375 --> 32:26.578
Lieutenant, can you hear me?

32:26.578 --> 32:29.181
Lieutenant Strickland,
are you there?

32:29.181 --> 32:30.682
There were several casualties

32:30.682 --> 32:33.185
and Michael's unit
had a heavy patient flow.

32:33.185 --> 32:37.023
He'll be unable to make it home
on leave as anticipated.

32:37.023 --> 32:39.225
His CASH is incommunicado
right now.

32:39.225 --> 32:42.428
He's asked me to pass
this information on to you.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.464
But Michael's all right?
He's not injured or anything.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.267
No, ma'am. A little homesick
and sand-weary, I imagine,

32:48.267 --> 32:50.602
but he's fine.

32:50.602 --> 32:54.540
Uh, thank you, Lieutenant.
I appreciate the phone call.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.542
You're welcome, ma'am.
You have a good night.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.151
( sniffling )

33:09.321 --> 33:12.091
Hey, does this look
like a subdural to you?

33:15.161 --> 33:16.695
Right here.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.233
No.
No.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.471
95% of the time,

33:25.471 --> 33:27.773
controlled hypotension
would have worked
in this situation.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.341
Make sure you tell that
to her family.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.077
Come on.
There's no way

33:31.077 --> 33:32.511
she should have had
a tamponade and
you know that.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.280
All I know is that she did.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.815
And if she'd been given fluids,
she would have survived.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.284
That's not a certainty.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.451
We would have
seen the signs.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.186
We could have drained

33:40.186 --> 33:42.188
the pericardium.

33:43.389 --> 33:46.792
Look, I did
what I thought

33:46.792 --> 33:48.460
was in her best interest.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.528
Even when two other doctors
disagreed with you.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.263
Dubenko agreed with me.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.232
You would have done the same
even if he hadn't.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.234
That's your style,
do whatever the hell you want,

33:55.234 --> 33:57.336
regardless of what
anyone else thinks.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.271
You don't like my style?
What is that?

33:59.271 --> 34:01.407
We were all here
a long time before you.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.574
We work together.
You're the new guy.

34:02.574 --> 34:03.709
You need to fit in
with us...

34:03.709 --> 34:05.677
What is this,
a damn social club?

34:05.677 --> 34:07.279
If you can't do that,
then we have a problem.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.414
I take risks
to save my patients.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.282
I'm sorry
if that scares you.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.817
Especially if you start
sucking in the residents.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.719
How about cutting-edge
medicine?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.422
I see a problem,
I fix it-- bam!

34:17.422 --> 34:19.257
What?

34:19.257 --> 34:21.693
Maybe you should
fix that.

34:21.693 --> 34:22.860
( sniffling )

34:22.860 --> 34:24.862
Here you go.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.833
Does that happen often?

34:27.833 --> 34:30.702
Only after five or six beers
and a bar fight.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.603
God, you know, people
just seem really wired

34:32.603 --> 34:33.871
after what happened
the other day.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.706
You picked up
on that, too, huh?

34:35.706 --> 34:38.377
Maybe we should have
a critical incident
debrief after shift.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.446
That's a great idea.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.648
Ooh, Dr. Barnett,
we're going to have

34:42.648 --> 34:45.650
a critical incident debrief
in Exam 3 after shift.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.652
Why?

34:46.652 --> 34:48.254
Why do you think?

34:48.254 --> 34:50.222
Look, this was
a tough shift for people.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.291
Helps if we can get
a chance to decompress

34:52.291 --> 34:53.725
before we go home.

34:53.725 --> 34:57.196
Yeah, well, that's why
God created beer, right?

34:57.196 --> 34:59.365
This thing's mandatory?

34:59.365 --> 35:00.399
Yes. Pass it on.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.202
What do you think?

35:03.202 --> 35:05.837
Kovac versus Clemente
in a street fight?

35:05.837 --> 35:09.741
Kovac has size,
but I have a feeling
Clemente's kind of squirrely.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.310
I think
you need help.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.411
( sniffling )

35:19.718 --> 35:20.719
What are you doing?

35:20.719 --> 35:23.722
Nothing.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.492
What happened
to your nose?

35:26.492 --> 35:28.494
Kovac.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.496
He hit you?

35:30.496 --> 35:32.764
No, but I bet
he would like to have.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.468
The last time
I got one of these

35:36.468 --> 35:39.838
was when Tina Marino
caught me with her cousin.

35:39.838 --> 35:43.275
Let me see.
Let me see.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.212
You're going
to need to be packed.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.246
No, it's tapering off.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.447
Yeah, that's
not working.

35:48.447 --> 35:51.550
Lockhart, I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.562
I'm really sorry
about the little girl.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.532
Me, too.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.235
I was trying to save her,

36:09.235 --> 36:10.869
despite what Dr. Kovac
might think.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.638
I know.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.612
Okay.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.520
I'm really, really sorry.

36:31.557 --> 36:34.260
Okay, put your head back.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.996
Hey, Kerry, have you found
someone to replace Susan

36:37.996 --> 36:39.498
as chief of the ER?

36:39.498 --> 36:41.467
We're still looking
at candidates.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.635
Is, uh, Clemente
the favorite?

36:43.635 --> 36:45.671
He's certainly
up there. Why?

36:45.671 --> 36:48.907
I'm just not sure
he's the right person
for the job.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.642
Yeah, well, if you think
of somebody better,

36:50.642 --> 36:52.478
feel free to give me a call.

36:52.478 --> 36:55.614
Uh, what about me?

36:55.614 --> 36:58.750
You? I didn't think
you wanted to be chief.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.888
Luka, it's really
not your style.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.923
Well, maybe it's time
for me to change my style.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.658
Look, I've been here
for a long time.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.295
I know the people.
I know the department.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.297
I just want to put my name
into the mixture.

37:11.297 --> 37:13.432
The mix.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.667
All right, I'll let
the committee know
you're interested.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.569
Thank you.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.340
Eve's waiting for you guys
in Exam 3 for the big powwow.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.308
She said it was
mandatory.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.575
Yeah, so did
Clemente.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.576
They want us to express
our feelings

37:24.576 --> 37:25.811
about what happened today.

37:25.811 --> 37:29.681
Well, today sucked. Good night.

37:29.681 --> 37:33.385
Great. Was it mandatory
for everyone except
the attendings?

37:33.385 --> 37:34.986
Edna Casselman, 56,
found down in the park, altered,

37:34.986 --> 37:36.722
no sign of trauma.

37:36.722 --> 37:39.591
Thank you, Edna.
Tell Eve I'm with a patient.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.859
( scoffs )

37:40.859 --> 37:43.529
It can't be
that bad, can it?

37:43.529 --> 37:45.697
It's not that.
Michael's leave
has been postponed.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.666
I'm sorry.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.601
Hey, can I come
by the house tonight,
pick up my amp?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.670
Whatever.
I really don't feel
like sticking around

37:51.670 --> 37:52.771
for this dumb thing.
Mm-hmm.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.373
I'll ditch if you do.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.574
I've got dinner
reservations at Gibson's

37:55.574 --> 37:57.909
if you want to grab
a drink or five.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.911
Wow. I like the way
you think, roomie.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.046
Your treat, right?

38:01.046 --> 38:03.549
As long as you stop
calling me that.

38:03.549 --> 38:04.650
( chuckles )

38:15.394 --> 38:16.562
How's the nose?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.502
Seems to be working.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.070
Thank you.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.545
The hell with this.
Go home.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.813
See you later.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.518
Eve, I thought
it was a great idea.

38:39.518 --> 38:40.952
I really did.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.625
This department needs
a lot of work.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.694
This department needs
a kick in the ass.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.061
Yeah.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.672
Parents show up?

39:00.672 --> 39:02.908
No. They should
be here soon.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.444
After all
she's been through.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.913
Maybe she's better off.

39:10.616 --> 39:12.918
I'm not sure
anybody's better off dead.

39:15.421 --> 39:18.824
Yeah. I recovered this
in the parking lot.

39:18.824 --> 39:21.793
She was asking
for it earlier.

39:23.595 --> 39:27.065
I got to go check in
on Officer Howe.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.668
I hear he's driving
the nurses upstairs crazy.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.703
How much trouble
do you think

40:04.703 --> 40:06.472
we're going to get in
for not showing up?

40:06.472 --> 40:07.839
Well, I'm not working
again until Saturday

40:07.839 --> 40:09.541
so hopefully things will
have blown over by then.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.942
You're kidding me.
I'm working tomorrow.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.210
That's great, Ray.
Now I'm going

40:12.210 --> 40:14.480
to get punished
for both of us.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.782
Whoa! Stop it! Stop it!

40:16.782 --> 40:17.916
Security!

40:17.916 --> 40:20.051
Someone call security!

40:22.621 --> 40:24.490
Security!

40:25.791 --> 40:28.660
Mr. Butler! Mr. Butler!
Stop it!

40:28.660 --> 40:30.529
( groans )

40:30.529 --> 40:35.133
You ever come near my daughter
again, and I'll kill ya.

40:36.568 --> 40:37.803
You hear me?

40:39.538 --> 40:42.708
( coughing )

40:42.708 --> 40:44.876
Ray?

40:44.876 --> 40:46.845
I'm fine.
Right.

40:46.845 --> 40:47.913
I'm fine!

40:55.721 --> 40:57.589
WOMAN:
...across the Chicago area.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.224
I'm going to widen the view out.

40:59.224 --> 41:02.594
Big storms across central
Illinois. This is along...

41:02.594 --> 41:03.995
( knocking )

41:03.995 --> 41:05.897
( TV turns off )

41:11.803 --> 41:13.572
Hey.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.740
Hey.

41:14.740 --> 41:17.543
Want to come in?

41:22.047 --> 41:24.783
You didn't, uh...

41:24.783 --> 41:26.785
you didn't go
to that debriefing.

41:26.785 --> 41:27.586
Did you?

41:27.586 --> 41:28.854
Yeah.

41:28.854 --> 41:31.857
It was just me, Eve,
and Clemente.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.024
You hungry?
You want some pizza?

41:33.024 --> 41:34.125
I can warm it up
in the microwave.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.663
No, I'm not hungry.
Okay.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.798
Mad about something?

41:43.001 --> 41:45.671
What do you think?

41:45.671 --> 41:47.639
Yes? I didn't need
to go to the briefing.

41:47.639 --> 41:48.640
I don't care
about that.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.008
What are you
talking about?

41:50.008 --> 41:53.579
I'm talking about
you and Clemente...

41:53.579 --> 41:55.013
and whatever it is
that is going on

41:55.013 --> 41:56.748
between the two
of you.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.116
If you want to get into
a pissing match with him,

41:58.116 --> 41:59.651
that's fine,
just leave me out of it.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.819
He was wrong.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.054
Yeah.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.891
And that's the most important
thing, isn't it?

42:05.891 --> 42:10.161
He was wrong
and you were right.

42:10.161 --> 42:13.198
And while you were arguing
about it, the little girl died.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.703
As if she hadn't
suffered enough.

42:21.907 --> 42:25.310
God, she was
ten years old, Luka.

42:29.014 --> 42:31.216
And he had her
for months,

42:31.216 --> 42:37.623
and I just, I just can't
stop thinking about...

42:37.623 --> 42:38.957
( voice breaking ):
what she must have
gone through.

42:38.957 --> 42:40.258
I can't stop thinking

42:40.258 --> 42:42.260
about how afraid
she must have been,

42:42.260 --> 42:45.130
and I can't stop thinking
about why we couldn't save her.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.197
I just...
