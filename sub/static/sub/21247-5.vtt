11:18.980 --> 11:21.180
I've had enough
of you and your hyenas!

11:23.020 --> 11:24.820
Uh, Kion?

11:26.150 --> 11:27.920
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

11:27.950 --> 11:30.250
Right. Don't lose control...

11:31.220 --> 11:32.790
(ROARS)

11:38.030 --> 11:40.260
That ought to teach 'em!

11:40.300 --> 11:43.100
Baboons! What's going on
with you guys?

11:43.140 --> 11:46.040
(CHITTERS) We were
following Ma Tembo!

11:46.070 --> 11:47.840
Oh, of course.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.910
The baboons always follow
the elephants

11:49.940 --> 11:52.040
to new water sources
in the dry season.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.210
Common knowledge, really.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.850
It's true.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.880
And usually there's enough
water for everyone.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.880
Well, if you're okay with it.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.090
Yes. It's my responsibility.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.850
My role in the Circle of Life.

12:03.890 --> 12:08.160
And as soon as I hear
the new water source,
everything will be fine...

12:08.190 --> 12:10.090
BUNGA: Don't you worry,
Ma Tembo!

12:10.130 --> 12:12.900
Now that Kion's
sent those hyenas flyin',

12:12.930 --> 12:15.130
you won't have any problem
findin' your water!

12:15.170 --> 12:17.070
I hope that's true.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.810
Ooh! (CHITTERING)

12:20.840 --> 12:24.110
Though I almost prefer
the hyenas to the baboons.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.110
(SCOFFS) I hear ya.

12:26.150 --> 12:27.850
Good luck, Ma Tembo.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.180
Thank you, Kion.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.880
(SIGHS)

12:31.920 --> 12:34.080
Wish there was something more
we could do to help Ma Tembo.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.820
Me too, Beshte.

12:35.860 --> 12:37.820
But this is Ma Tembo's role.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.120
Just like defending
the Pride Lands is ours.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.890
(BABOONS CHITTERING)

12:42.930 --> 12:44.900
We know you can
do it, Ma Tembo!

12:44.930 --> 12:46.260
ELEPHANT: Yeah, come on!

12:46.300 --> 12:47.970
Water, water, water!

12:48.000 --> 12:49.030
(ALL CHANTING)
Water, water, water!

12:49.070 --> 12:50.100

Water, water, water!

12:53.210 --> 12:54.940
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

12:54.970 --> 12:59.110
Still, I should probably
mention what's going on
to my dad.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.210
MAKINI: I'm soooo excited,
Rafiki!

13:03.250 --> 13:06.750
I can't believe
I'm finally starting
my training!

13:06.790 --> 13:08.850
The new stripes
on your face

13:08.890 --> 13:10.150
and the color of your nose

13:10.190 --> 13:13.790
mean you're old enough
to be a Royal Mjuzi.

13:13.830 --> 13:15.960
But you must learn
to be quiet

13:16.000 --> 13:17.960
to hear
the Lions of the Past.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.900
Ooh, yes! I know!

13:19.930 --> 13:21.970
I can't wait to learn
how to hear them!

13:22.000 --> 13:23.800
Good.
Did I tell you

13:23.840 --> 13:26.070
I saw Kion talking
to Mufasa this morning?

13:26.110 --> 13:27.810
It was amazing!

13:27.840 --> 13:29.170
Yes, now...

13:29.210 --> 13:31.840
But he said you don't talk
about hearing
the Lions of the Past.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.040
Yes, because...
No, no, no!

13:34.080 --> 13:35.910
I totally, totally get it.

13:35.950 --> 13:37.980
It's just that it's so hard
not to talk about it!

13:38.020 --> 13:41.220
<i> ♪ For now is my time</i>

13:41.250 --> 13:43.820
<i> ♪ Today is my day... ♪</i>
Yes.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.890
You are having trouble
not talking about it.

13:46.930 --> 13:50.900
But you must be quiet
and listen to what I say,

13:50.930 --> 13:54.030
if you are to be
Royal Mjuzi someday.

13:54.070 --> 14:00.000
Remember, the hardest part
of listening is finding
the quiet to hear.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.140
Sorry, Rafiki.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.910
I'm just really excited.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.110
That is understandable.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.210
But to hear
the Lions of the Past,

14:06.250 --> 14:09.210
you must be calm and quiet.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.950
<i> Shwari,</i> Makini,<i> shwari</i> .

14:11.980 --> 14:13.920
Observe.
Okay.

14:18.820 --> 14:21.760
Rafiki?
Yes?

14:21.790 --> 14:23.760
I'm still not
hearing anything.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.200
You must be
calm and quiet.

14:25.230 --> 14:28.000
But I was being
calm and quiet!

14:28.030 --> 14:30.030
(SIGHS) Makini. Makini.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.840
It seems you must
also learn patience.

14:32.870 --> 14:35.040
Oh, yes! I can't wait
to learn to be patient!

14:35.070 --> 14:36.210
Let's do it right now!

14:36.240 --> 14:37.810
Hmm.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.950
Perhaps you need
something to ground you.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.850
Ha ha! Yes!

14:45.890 --> 14:47.950
You need your bakora staff!

14:49.020 --> 14:50.890
(CHUCKLES)

14:50.920 --> 14:55.230
Just like the antenna
helps an insect sense
its surroundings.

14:55.260 --> 15:01.000
The bakora staff helps
the Royal Mjuzi sense
the Lions of the Past.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.800
Whoa.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.770
Of course, it is up to you
to find your bakora staff.

15:05.810 --> 15:06.970
On your own.

15:08.110 --> 15:09.170
Really?

15:09.940 --> 15:12.180
Yes.

15:12.210 --> 15:17.850
Now. Look among
the fallen branches
for your bakora staff.

15:17.880 --> 15:22.090
You will need it
for your official introduction
to the Royal Family.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.090
My official introduction?

15:24.120 --> 15:26.120
As soon as
you find your staff.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.760
But...

15:27.790 --> 15:29.990
How will I know
which one to choose?

15:30.030 --> 15:31.930
<i> Shwari,</i> Makini.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.230
You will know
when you know. (LAUGHS)

15:37.940 --> 15:40.100
But it would not hurt
to be quiet

15:40.140 --> 15:43.240
and let the branch
speak to you!

15:45.980 --> 15:48.950
I know it's frustrating, Kion.

15:48.980 --> 15:52.820
But leading the elephants
is Ma Tembo's responsibility.

15:52.850 --> 15:54.820
There's not a whole lot
we can do.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.990
Elephants are the ones
with the ability
to find water.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.190
Not lions.

15:59.230 --> 16:02.030
I know. I just wish
I could help.

16:02.060 --> 16:05.200
I know what it's like
to be a new leader
with new responsibilities.

16:05.230 --> 16:09.070

Yes. And I'm very proud
of how much you've grown

18:34.010 --> 18:35.950
as the leader
of the Lion Guard.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.050
Thanks, Dad.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.920

18:56.070 --> 18:59.800
Now that I know Kion's
been getting advice
from Mufasa,

18:59.840 --> 19:02.940
I'll finally have some
leverage with the Lion Guard.

19:02.980 --> 19:06.010

in the Pride Lands
will respect me.

something meatier?

19:24.200 --> 19:27.730
Oh, we would

19:29.240 --> 19:32.940
Instead of lettin' us eat
whatever we want
in the Pride Lands.

19:32.970 --> 19:36.870
Well if Kion's your problem,
I might have a solution.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.810
What?
Yes.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.810
The reason Kion is so
successful leading
the Lion Guard,

19:42.850 --> 19:46.780
is because he's getting advice
from the greatest lion
to rule the Pride Lands.

19:46.820 --> 19:47.950
Mufasa!

19:47.990 --> 19:50.020
(SCOFFS) Mufasa?

19:50.060 --> 19:53.090
I think you've been pounced on
one too many times, snake.

19:53.130 --> 19:58.130
The name's Ushari.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.100
And you need to starttsmart
the thinking like lions!

20:01.130 --> 20:03.070
Great lions!

20:03.100 --> 20:05.100
In case you hadn't
noticed Ushari,

20:05.140 --> 20:07.840
we're hyenas, not lions.

20:07.870 --> 20:09.770
Yeah, that's right!

20:09.810 --> 20:11.040
(CHUCKLES)
We sure ain't!

20:11.080 --> 20:14.040
And there ain't no lion
that's gonna help us hyenas.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.050
Let alone a great one!

20:16.080 --> 20:18.780
(HYENAS LAUGHING)

20:18.820 --> 20:22.150
But there was one great lion
who helped hyenas.

20:23.090 --> 20:24.250
Oh, you mean Scar?

20:24.290 --> 20:26.860
Hate to break it
to ya, Ushari.

20:26.890 --> 20:30.860
But Scar died in the fire
at Pride Rock a long time ago.

20:30.900 --> 20:34.830
Yes. But if Kion
can talk to Mufasa,

20:34.870 --> 20:38.170
there must be a way
for us to speak to Scar.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.140
Huh, you think?

20:40.170 --> 20:42.110
I'm certain!

20:42.140 --> 20:45.040
It's just a question of how!

20:45.080 --> 20:47.110
How do we talk to Scar?

20:47.150 --> 20:50.180
I need to gather
some more information first.

20:50.220 --> 20:52.180
If you'll let me go.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.920
Yeah, all right.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.950
But we're gonna follow you
the whole time.

20:55.990 --> 20:57.920
In case you're makin'
all this up.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.120
Fair enough.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.890
I believe I know someone
who will give us

21:03.930 --> 21:06.200
all the information
we need.

21:14.210 --> 21:15.770
Nope.

21:15.810 --> 21:16.810
How about you?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.880

21:18.910 --> 21:19.980
Anything?

21:20.010 --> 21:22.810
USHARI: Well!
If it isn't Makini!

21:22.850 --> 21:24.110
Was that a stick?

21:25.020 --> 21:27.020
Oh. You're a snake.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.820
Not a stick.

21:28.850 --> 21:33.060
True. But I've heard
that you are Rafiki's
new apprentice.

21:33.090 --> 21:35.890
Oh, yes! I've just started
studying with him!

21:35.930 --> 21:37.160

21:37.200 --> 21:38.860
I'm sure it is.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.900
And he couldn't have
picked a more worthy mandril.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.900
Oh, thank you!

21:43.940 --> 21:47.070
Yes, of course.

21:47.110 --> 21:51.070
I suppose this means
you can speak
to the Lions of the Past?

21:51.110 --> 21:54.980
Like how Kion
speaks to Mufasa?
What?

21:55.010 --> 21:57.050
How does a snake
like you know that?

21:57.080 --> 21:58.950
Oh. Uh, well...

21:58.980 --> 22:02.150
I'm friends with Kion
and the Lion Guard.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.950
We go way back.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.060
Oh.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.120
Then you know only the lions
in Simba's Pride

22:07.160 --> 22:09.890
and the royal Mjuzi can hear
the Lions of the Past.

22:09.930 --> 22:12.000
Yes, yes.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.100
But does that include
the evil lions?

22:14.130 --> 22:15.930
Like Scar?

22:15.970 --> 22:17.770
Can you speak to him as well?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.870
Oh!
What a frightening thought.

22:19.910 --> 22:21.910
I never even
thought about that!

22:21.940 --> 22:25.140
I'd have to ask Rafiki
if there's a way
to hear them. (GASPS)

22:25.180 --> 22:28.980
The hardest part of listening
is finding the quiet to hear.

22:29.010 --> 22:30.210
<i> Shwari.</i>

22:30.950 --> 22:31.980
Yes.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.820
I'd be so interested to...
Shh!

22:34.850 --> 22:36.220
Quiet!

22:36.260 --> 22:38.220
(INDISTINCT WHISPERS)

22:38.260 --> 22:40.220
(WIND HOWLING)

22:47.900 --> 22:49.000
This is it!

22:49.030 --> 22:50.170
This is the one!

22:50.200 --> 22:51.840
The one what?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.140
I've found my staff!

22:53.170 --> 22:54.270
I gotta tell Rafiki!

22:54.310 --> 22:56.910
Rafiki? Hmm...

22:57.980 --> 22:59.240
Oh! Sorry there, snake.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.910
What were you saying?

23:01.810 --> 23:03.850
Huh. Oh, well.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.920
Hey, Rafiki!

23:08.850 --> 23:09.920
Rafiki!

23:09.960 --> 23:12.060
Rafiki! You won't believe it!

23:12.090 --> 23:13.890
Or maybe you will.

23:13.930 --> 23:17.090
I think I heard
the Lions of the Past
when I touched this stick!

23:17.130 --> 23:18.830
Ha ha! Yes!

23:18.900 --> 23:21.200
You have found
your bakora staff!

23:21.230 --> 23:26.770
Now, these gourds
will be an important part
of your new staff.

23:26.810 --> 23:30.170
One for the future,
and one for the past.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.050
(GIGGLES)

23:35.080 --> 23:38.950
Yes. Now we must go
to the Lair and try out
your new staff.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.890
Then we can introduce you
to the Royal Family!

23:41.920 --> 23:43.950
Ooh, Rafiki?
I have another question.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.790
About the Lions of the Past.

23:45.820 --> 23:49.930
Yes. I know you have
many questions.

23:49.960 --> 23:53.100
And we will talk about it,
once we are in the Lair!

23:54.100 --> 23:55.170
It's real.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.170
They are able to hear
the Lions of the Past!

23:58.200 --> 23:59.900
Yeah, yeah.

23:59.940 --> 24:04.070
And it sounds like
Makini's going to ask
Rafiki how to talk to Scar.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.840
Now go follow them.
They're goin'
to somebody's lair!

24:06.880 --> 24:08.980
Follow them?
Into a lair?

24:09.010 --> 24:12.020
We can't be seen
rompin' round
the Pride Lands.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.920
So it's gotta be you.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.950
Ya got a problem with that?

24:15.990 --> 24:17.750
Listen, Janja.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.160
Talking to Makini
is one thing.

24:19.190 --> 24:22.930
But I can't slither
fast enough to keep up
with her and Rafiki!

24:22.960 --> 24:25.130
Sure, sure. I understand.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.200
After all, if you'd rather
be our dinner...

24:28.230 --> 24:31.870
(CHUCKLING) Dinner time!

24:31.900 --> 24:34.140
Yummy yum yum!

24:34.170 --> 24:35.870
No, no. Of course not!

24:35.910 --> 24:37.010
It's just that...

24:37.040 --> 24:40.110
I have some friends
who move much faster than me.

24:40.150 --> 24:43.180
And they're
excellent spies.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.980
Friends?
Yes.

24:46.020 --> 24:47.980
Skinks! Come out!

24:48.020 --> 24:49.950
I know you're there!

24:52.290 --> 24:54.190
Ew. What are they?

24:54.230 --> 24:57.960
I dunno, but they're spooky!

24:58.000 --> 25:00.130
Hello, Ushari.
You called?

25:00.170 --> 25:01.830
I did.

25:01.870 --> 25:05.140
Can one of your skinks follow
Rafiki and Makini for us?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.770
Of course.

25:06.810 --> 25:09.770
But there better be
something in it for us.

25:09.810 --> 25:11.070
If all goes well,

25:11.110 --> 25:15.010
it could tip the balance
of the Pride Lands
in our favor.

25:15.050 --> 25:18.050
Hmm. Sounds interesting...

25:18.850 --> 25:20.120
Nyeusi, hurry!

25:20.150 --> 25:21.820
Follow Rafiki and Makini!

25:21.850 --> 25:23.190
Tell us where they go!

25:23.220 --> 25:27.020
Nyeusi is
the stealthiest skink.

25:27.060 --> 25:29.090
Rafiki will never see him.

25:29.130 --> 25:30.190
He's lucky.

25:30.230 --> 25:32.760
These skinks
give me the creeps!

25:32.800 --> 25:35.070
(CHUCKLING) Me too!

25:38.520 --> 25:40.890
I can't believe I'm finally
starting my training!i!

25:40.920 --> 25:43.420
I can't wait to learn
how to hear them!

25:43.460 --> 25:44.890
RAFIKI: This way,
Makini. This way!

25:45.830 --> 25:47.760
Lion Guard! Come!

25:47.800 --> 25:50.530
I have someone
I want you to meet.

25:50.570 --> 25:52.700
This is my new apprentice.

25:52.730 --> 25:53.770
Makini!

25:53.800 --> 25:56.640
Makini,
this is the Lion Guard.

25:56.670 --> 25:58.470
And their Lair.

25:58.510 --> 25:59.510
Hi ya, Makini!

25:59.540 --> 26:00.810
Greetings!
Nice to meet you.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.410
Hi again, Makini.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.580
Hi, Kion.

26:03.610 --> 26:06.680
And wow! It's so fantastic
to meet the rest of you!

26:06.720 --> 26:08.650
I mean, obviously
I've seen you all before

26:08.680 --> 26:10.380
while you're going around
the Pride Lands,

26:10.420 --> 26:11.650
being all strong.

26:11.690 --> 26:12.750
And brave.

26:12.790 --> 26:13.790
And fast.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.560
And keenest of sight!
(SQUAWKS)

26:15.590 --> 26:17.620
And always saving the day!

26:17.660 --> 26:19.630
Yep. That's us all right!

26:19.660 --> 26:22.730
And it's so exciting
to meet you all
up close and personal!

26:22.760 --> 26:25.500
I'm sure it is.
It is!

26:25.530 --> 26:28.700
But I have to say,
I really admire you
the most, Fuli.

26:28.740 --> 26:32.470
Rafiki says you're
the only girl to ever
be on the Lion Guard!

26:32.510 --> 26:33.670
As in, ever!

26:33.710 --> 26:34.840
Uh, I am?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.480
It is true.

26:36.510 --> 26:38.650
Yeah! You've got
to be so proud!

26:38.680 --> 26:40.610
I'm proud
and I'm not even you!

26:40.650 --> 26:42.650
Thanks, Makini.
Sure!

26:42.680 --> 26:45.590
So Rafiki, why are you
taking on an apprentice?

26:45.620 --> 26:47.850
Are you okay?
Yes, Beshte, yes.

26:47.890 --> 26:49.460
I am fine.

26:49.930 --> 26:53.730
You see, when Makini was born,

26:53.760 --> 26:57.500
the Lions of the Past told me
that she would be the one

26:57.530 --> 27:00.770
to continue my role
in the Circle of Life.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.740
And now that the stripes
have appeared on her face,

27:03.770 --> 27:07.670
it is time for Makini
to begin her training!

27:07.710 --> 27:10.840
Rafiki? Did you do
all of those paintings?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.550
Only some.

27:12.580 --> 27:15.480
Most were done by those
who came before me.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.620
And someday it will be
your turn to paint them!

27:18.650 --> 27:19.750
(LAUGHS)

27:19.790 --> 27:22.390
Okay...

27:22.420 --> 27:25.730
Kion, can you assemble
the Royal Family on Pride Rock

27:25.760 --> 27:27.790
for Makini's
formal introduction?

27:27.830 --> 27:30.530
Sure, Rafiki. I'll make sure
we're all there.

27:35.740 --> 27:38.440
This is the place?

27:38.470 --> 27:41.710
Yep. Nyeusi says
Rafiki and Makini
went in there.

27:41.740 --> 27:46.580
But if you ask me,
we're already too close
to Pride Rock for comfort.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.450
That's fine.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.850
I'll take it from here.

27:49.890 --> 27:51.480
Thanks, Shupavu.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.520
Yeah. Let's get outta here.

27:56.630 --> 27:59.530
So, Rafiki? Can I try out
my bakora staff now?

27:59.560 --> 28:02.500
Wait. Your staff can bring
paintings to life too?

28:02.530 --> 28:04.460
RAFIKI: We shall
soon find out.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.370
Go ahead, Makini.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.540
(ROARS)

28:13.580 --> 28:15.540
Whoa!
Look at that!

28:15.580 --> 28:17.610
MAKINI: It worked!
ONO: I'll say!

28:17.650 --> 28:18.710
So!

28:18.750 --> 28:22.680
Makini's staff is more
than a simple stick!

28:22.720 --> 28:26.690
It seems you have
chosen your
staff well, Makini.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.490
That's Scar, isn't it?

28:28.520 --> 28:32.490
Yeah. The worst lion to ever
live in the Pride Lands!

28:32.530 --> 28:34.560
Ooh. That reminds me, Rafiki.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.430
My question.
From earlier?

28:36.470 --> 28:37.900
Yes.

28:37.930 --> 28:40.800
I know the bakora staff
can help me hear
the Great Lions of the Past.

28:40.840 --> 28:44.770
But is there a way
to hear the Bad Lions
of the Past too?

28:44.810 --> 28:48.680
Hmm. That is
a serious question,
young one.

28:48.710 --> 28:54.710
But, you must know the bad
as well as the good.

28:54.750 --> 29:00.420
As you know, Makini,
your bakora not only brings
images of the past to life.

29:00.460 --> 29:03.690
It can help you hear
the Lions of the Past.

29:03.730 --> 29:06.790
The Great Lions of the Past
are in the sky.

29:06.830 --> 29:09.630
Their voices are in the wind.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.500
And you have all seen Kion
use the Roar

29:12.530 --> 29:14.770
to make those
Great Lions appear.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.810
But the Roar can also summon
the worst lions
of the Pride Lands past.

29:19.840 --> 29:24.710
Instead of clouds,
these lions appear in fire.

29:24.750 --> 29:31.550
Once summoned,
the bakora can be used
to talk to evil lions as well.

29:31.590 --> 29:34.520
All the evil lions?
Even Scar?

29:34.560 --> 29:36.720
Yes. Even Scar.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.430
Yes!

29:39.460 --> 29:40.830
(SHUDDERS)
Whoa!

29:40.860 --> 29:42.460
Creepy!

29:42.500 --> 29:44.660
You said it, Bunga.
Totally.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.670
Thank you
for telling me, Rafiki.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.740
Of course, young one.
Of course.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.400
But remember.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.840
Talking to bad lions?

29:51.870 --> 29:55.480
It is a bad idea! (LAUGHS)

29:55.510 --> 29:57.740
Got it!
I totally understand!

29:57.780 --> 30:00.550
And so do I.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.550
Now, it is time.

30:03.590 --> 30:05.890
Time to present
Makini to Simba

30:05.920 --> 30:08.660
and the rest
of the Royal Family!

30:08.690 --> 30:10.460
(LAUGHS)

30:10.490 --> 30:12.530
This way, Makini!
(GASPS AND GIGGLES)

30:12.930 --> 30:14.730
Good luck, Makini!

30:17.670 --> 30:19.830
I'm looking forward
to meeting
Rafiki's apprentice.

30:19.870 --> 30:21.570
You've already
met her, Kion?

30:21.600 --> 30:22.900
Unofficially, yeah.

30:22.940 --> 30:27.910
She's, uh, very talkative.

30:27.940 --> 30:30.540
Any word on Ma Tembo's
first water hunt?

30:30.580 --> 30:33.710
According to Ono's
last report,
she's still searching.

30:33.750 --> 30:37.720
Can you imagine anything
more boring than having
to look for water?

30:37.750 --> 30:39.490
No. (CHUCKLES)

30:39.520 --> 30:41.550
It's not so boring
if you're thirsty.

30:41.860 --> 30:43.690
Mom? Dad?

30:43.730 --> 30:45.930
Would it be okay
if I tried to help Ma Tembo?

30:45.960 --> 30:49.500
I'm not sure there's anything
you can do to help, Kiara.

30:49.530 --> 30:50.830
I'd at least like to try.

30:50.870 --> 30:55.600
Finding the new water source
is Ma Tembo's responsibility.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.640
But even if you can't find
the water yourself,

30:58.670 --> 31:02.410
it might be a good experience
for you to learn
to work with Ma Tembo.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.540
Especially as future Queen.

31:04.580 --> 31:05.880
MAKINI: Oh, oh!
Can I help?

31:05.910 --> 31:08.510
If the future Queen
is going on a mission,

31:08.550 --> 31:09.720
I'd like to go too!

31:09.750 --> 31:12.650
I'm Makini!
Rafiki's new apprentice!

31:12.690 --> 31:13.790
RAFIKI: Makini!

31:13.820 --> 31:16.620
The official introduction
is for me to do.

31:16.660 --> 31:19.460
But why would Makini
introduce you?

31:19.490 --> 31:22.500
Yeah! We already know
who you are, Rafiki.

31:22.530 --> 31:25.730
Rafiki is supposed
to introduce Makini.

31:25.770 --> 31:28.500
Oh! Now that makes sense.

31:28.540 --> 31:30.640
Yes, yes.
Stand here, Makini.

31:30.670 --> 31:32.840
King Simba.
Queen Nala.

31:32.870 --> 31:35.580
Royal family and friends.

31:35.610 --> 31:39.750
May I present
my new apprentice Makini!

31:39.780 --> 31:43.780
It's a great honor
to be chosen
as the next knowledge keeper

31:43.820 --> 31:45.550
for the Pride Lands.

31:45.590 --> 31:48.920
But as Royal Mjuzi,
you are always welcome
at Pride Rock.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.790
Yes. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Makini.

31:51.830 --> 31:53.760
Thank you, your majesties.

31:53.800 --> 31:58.630
Someday, Makini will be
Royal Mjuzi for Queen Kiara.

31:58.670 --> 32:00.700
Then maybe Makini
should come with me

32:00.740 --> 32:02.800
to help Ma Tembo
and the elephants find water.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.770
Ooh yes, yes!

32:04.810 --> 32:06.810
They will have to learn
to work together.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.570
Just like you and Rafiki do.

32:08.610 --> 32:10.810
That is true.
Eh, Simba?

32:10.850 --> 32:12.610
Yes.

32:12.650 --> 32:15.680
And the sooner they learn
how to work together,
the better.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.720
Oh thank you,
your highnesses!

32:17.750 --> 32:19.590
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

32:19.620 --> 32:20.890
You're welcome, Makini.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.420
Okay,
my future advisor.

32:23.460 --> 32:24.890
Let's go!

32:24.930 --> 32:27.860
Wait. I thought we were
Kiara's royal advisors.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.600
Yeah! She can't go looking
for water without us!

32:31.630 --> 32:33.530
Wait! We're coming, too!

32:33.570 --> 32:36.570
Ladies? Why don't
we let Kiara
get to know Makini.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.640
You can stay here
on Pride Rock. With me.

32:39.610 --> 32:41.610
With you?

32:41.640 --> 32:44.840
Oh, um, yes,
Your Majesty! Yes!

32:44.880 --> 32:46.550
Of course!

32:46.580 --> 32:49.580
I'm so excited to be working
with you, Princess Kiara!

32:49.620 --> 32:52.550
I'm sure I can learn
so much from you!

32:52.590 --> 32:53.720
Good luck, Kiara.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.820
Thanks, Kion.
MAKINI: C'mon,
Princess Kiara!

32:55.860 --> 32:58.730
Let's go!
I might need it.

33:03.470 --> 33:05.530
So, there is a way
to talk to Scar!

33:05.570 --> 33:06.700
Yes.

33:06.740 --> 33:11.440
According to Rafiki,
the evil lions appear in fire.

33:11.470 --> 33:14.470
Well, one little eruption
of this here volcano

33:14.510 --> 33:16.510
and we'll get
plenty of fire!

33:16.540 --> 33:18.640
Yeah, right!
Plenty of it!

33:18.680 --> 33:19.850
(ALL LAUGHING)

33:21.580 --> 33:22.620
Yes.

33:22.650 --> 33:25.620
We'll also need
Rafiki or Makini's staff.

33:25.650 --> 33:28.490
The staff will allow us
to speak to Scar.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.860
We'll go after Makini.

33:29.890 --> 33:32.890
One little mandrill's
no match for us hyenas.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.490
I agree.

33:34.530 --> 33:37.700
So the real question is,
how do we lure Kion

33:37.730 --> 33:39.870
to the volcano
and make him Roar?

33:39.900 --> 33:42.540
We'll want him to give us
a big Roar, too.

33:42.570 --> 33:45.810
One that will make
the volcano erupt in flames!

33:45.840 --> 33:47.710
Ooh, ooh! I know. I know.

33:47.740 --> 33:51.710
Kion Roared real big
the time we tried
to eat Bunga!

33:51.750 --> 33:52.910
(CHUCKLES) Yeah!

33:52.950 --> 33:56.680
And his Roar was even bigger
when we went after his mom.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.420
It even made
the ground open up!

33:59.450 --> 34:01.550
What? Janja, is this true?

34:01.590 --> 34:04.660
Yeah, yeah.
The fur brains
are actually right.

34:04.690 --> 34:08.730
Kion's Roars are huge
when his friends and family
are threatened!

34:08.760 --> 34:11.400
Then that's what
we have to do.

34:11.429 --> 34:15.840
Target someone
Kion cares about,
and bring them here!

34:15.870 --> 34:17.500
Yeah.

34:17.540 --> 34:21.870
And then when Kion roars,
we can bring back a legend!

34:21.909 --> 34:23.610
(LAUGHING)

34:23.650 --> 34:28.610

36:05.410 --> 36:08.550
I'll be waiting at the top
of the volcano for the staff.

36:08.580 --> 36:09.720
You got it, Ushari.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.520
Let's go, boys! (LAUGHING)

(BABOON CHITTERING)

36:25.530 --> 36:27.500
When is she going
to find the water?

36:27.540 --> 36:28.600
I'm sure it will be
any minute.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.570
Well it better be!
I'm parched!

36:31.610 --> 36:34.510
So is there anything
we can do to help?

36:34.540 --> 36:35.880
I don't know if there is.

36:35.910 --> 36:39.610
I believe we're in
the general area
of the new water source.

36:39.650 --> 36:41.510
But I haven't found
the well site yet.

36:41.550 --> 36:43.480
Maybe we could look around
for wet rocks,

36:43.520 --> 36:45.590
or some other sign
of underground water?

36:45.620 --> 36:46.790
Oh, yes.

36:46.820 --> 36:48.490
That would be helpful.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.660
You know what they say.

36:49.690 --> 36:51.760
Many eyes make
a search seem smaller!

36:51.790 --> 36:53.630
Well said, Makini.

36:53.660 --> 36:55.530
And, thank you, your highness.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.830
Happy to help, Ma Tembo.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.600
C'mon, Makini.
Let's find that water!

36:59.630 --> 37:01.500
(ANIMALS CONTINUE CHANTING)

37:02.740 --> 37:05.670
That was a good idea
you had back there, Makini.

37:05.710 --> 37:06.710
I'm impressed.

37:06.740 --> 37:09.780
Well, I really
admire you Kiara.

37:09.810 --> 37:12.410
Water is so important
to the Circle of Life.

37:12.450 --> 37:15.650
So your helping Ma Tembo
find water is even more...
Wait.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.620
I thought I heard something.

37:17.650 --> 37:19.420
Hmm... (SNIFFS)

37:19.450 --> 37:21.420
That's funny.
I didn't hear anything.

37:21.460 --> 37:22.860
But I know that's something
I need to work on.

37:22.890 --> 37:24.720
Being quiet
so I can hear things.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.560
Like the Lions of the Past!

37:26.590 --> 37:28.460
Makini! Be quiet!

37:28.500 --> 37:29.830
(CHUCKLES) I know, right?

37:29.860 --> 37:32.670
That's what everyone's
always trying to tell me!

37:32.700 --> 37:35.400
<i> Shwari,</i> Makini.<i> Shwari.</i>

C'mon, boys, let's go!

37:50.490 --> 37:52.520
Kiara? Oh, no!

37:52.550 --> 37:53.920
Makini! Help!

37:53.960 --> 37:57.590
It's gonna take
more than one little mandrill
to save you Kiara!

37:57.630 --> 38:00.530
A lot more! (LAUGHING)

38:00.560 --> 38:03.500
(HYENAS LAUGHING)

38:03.530 --> 38:06.600
Janja's right. I'm no match
for those hyenas.

38:06.630 --> 38:08.400
But I know who is!

38:10.120 --> 38:12.320
Lion GuardTh

38:12.360 --> 38:14.120
Makini? What's wrong?

38:14.160 --> 38:16.230
The hyenas!
They attacked us.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.490
And they... They've
taken off with Kiara!

38:18.530 --> 38:20.260
What?
Kiara?

38:20.300 --> 38:23.200
Ono! See if you can spot
Janja and his clan!

38:23.230 --> 38:24.300
Affirmative!

38:33.410 --> 38:36.110
They're taking Kiara
into the Outlands!

38:36.150 --> 38:37.450
This is all my fault.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.350
I wasn't quiet
when Kiara asked me to be.

38:40.390 --> 38:41.480
Makini.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.120
You can't blame yourself
for something Janja did.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.120
Right. What matters now
is that we rescue Kiara!

38:47.160 --> 38:48.120
C'mon!

39:02.310 --> 39:04.270
And we got Kiara!

39:04.310 --> 39:06.040
Excellent!

39:06.080 --> 39:08.180
That should get
Kion's attention.

39:08.210 --> 39:09.350
Yeah.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.380
Janja figures the Lion Guard
should be here any second.

39:12.420 --> 39:13.450
Then you should go.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.050
Janja may need your help
down below.

39:16.090 --> 39:17.420
Yeah, all right.

what you're thinking, Janja.

But you're not gonna
get away with this!

39:31.300 --> 39:32.440
That's what you think.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.300
Chungu, toss her in.

39:37.140 --> 39:38.340
That ought to keep you.

Ahh!

Oh.

39:44.180 --> 39:47.280
(LAUGHING) Yeah!

39:47.320 --> 39:49.120
How about that, cub?

39:49.150 --> 39:51.120
That steam is really hot!

39:51.420 --> 39:52.490
<i> Hapana.</i>

39:52.520 --> 39:54.220
Gotta tell Kion.

ONO: Everyone! Everyone!

39:58.100 --> 39:59.300
Ono! What do you see?

39:59.330 --> 40:01.100
Kiara seems okay.

40:01.130 --> 40:04.170
But the hyenas
have her surrounded,
and trapped by steam vents.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.430
What's Janja up to?

40:05.470 --> 40:08.240
The only reason
he'd hold Kiara prisoner

40:08.270 --> 40:10.510
is because he wants
something from me or my Dad.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.440
Like what?
Who cares?

40:12.480 --> 40:16.110
We go in, Kion Roars,
and we come back out
with Kiara!

40:16.150 --> 40:18.210
I'm not sure it's gonna be
as easy as that, Bunga.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.080
Indeed.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.080
Kion won't want
to Roar at the hyenas
if they're surrounding Kiara.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.290
Oh, yeah...
I have an idea.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.520
The hyenas will be expecting
me to come to the rescue.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.190
But if they think
I'm the only one here,

40:30.230 --> 40:32.560
I might be able to lure them
away from Kiara.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.230
Then we'll only have to get
past the steam vents.

40:35.270 --> 40:36.430
And I think I know
how to do that.

40:36.470 --> 40:39.100
All right!
Now we're talking!

40:39.140 --> 40:43.140
Okay. I'll go this way
and try to distract
Janja and the others.

the other way so the hyenas
won't see us coming.

41:40.570 --> 41:43.230
What brings you all the way
into the Outlands?

41:43.270 --> 41:45.430
You know
why I'm here, Janja.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.300
Just let Kiara go.

41:47.340 --> 41:49.210
Or there's gonna be trouble.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.270
Without the Guard
to back you up?

41:51.310 --> 41:52.580
(LAUGHING)

41:52.610 --> 41:55.210
I don't think so, Kion.

41:55.250 --> 41:58.180
We both know
I don't need the Guard
for back up.

41:58.220 --> 42:00.280
But you might need
your hyenas.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.380
Oh. So you're gonna
Roar at us then, huh?

42:02.420 --> 42:04.520
Yes! Roar, Kion.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.060
Roar!

42:06.090 --> 42:07.390
Only if I have to.

42:07.430 --> 42:09.120
Argh.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.530
Well, uh, we ain't givin' her
back just'cause you say so.

42:12.560 --> 42:16.070
'Cause... We got demands
and stuff!

42:16.100 --> 42:18.170
KION: Stop
playing games, Janja.

42:18.200 --> 42:21.200
Good scouting, Ono.
Thanks.

42:21.240 --> 42:24.310
But Kion's plan isn't working
exactly the way we hoped.

42:24.340 --> 42:25.310
What do you mean?

42:27.110 --> 42:30.280
ONO: So far, Kion's only lured
Janja away from Kiara.

42:30.310 --> 42:33.550
The rest of the hyenas
are still guarding Kiara
at the steam vents!

42:33.580 --> 42:36.290
And... They appear
to be singing to her.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.350
Oh, no!

42:37.390 --> 42:39.260
We really gotta
save her now.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.460
It won't be easy.

42:40.490 --> 42:43.490
She's still surrounded
by hyenas and the steam vents!

42:43.530 --> 42:46.100
So? We're the Lion Guard.

42:46.130 --> 42:48.500
If we have to do things
the hard way,
that's what we'll do.

42:48.530 --> 42:50.130
You said it, Fuli.

42:50.170 --> 42:53.140
Right. So here's
the new plan.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.200
What do you want, Janja?

42:55.240 --> 42:56.410
What do I want?

42:56.440 --> 42:58.510
Uh, good question.

42:58.540 --> 43:02.440
I want you and the Lion Guard
to let me and my pack alone!

43:02.480 --> 43:04.450
Yeah!
What?

43:04.480 --> 43:07.220
You dragged my sister
to the Outlands.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.080
You're holding her prisoner.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.120
And you're doing
all of this,

43:11.160 --> 43:13.290
because you want me
to leave you alone?

43:13.320 --> 43:15.460
Uh, yeah!
That's right!

43:15.490 --> 43:18.360
Janja, that's a terrible plan!

43:18.400 --> 43:20.060
Even for you!

43:20.100 --> 43:21.530
Huh. I thought
it was a good plan!

43:21.570 --> 43:24.200
Me too!

43:24.240 --> 43:26.400
Sure looks like Kion's
got them distracted.

my paws on the steam vent.
