<i>- Okay, what is this place?
- Brakebills University.</i>

00:04.909 --> 00:06.476
<i>You've been offered
a preliminary exam</i>

00:06.511 --> 00:08.478
<i>for entry into the graduate program.</i>

00:08.513 --> 00:11.114
Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

00:11.149 --> 00:13.684
- Can I start over?
- There's this voice.

00:13.718 --> 00:15.352
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

00:15.386 --> 00:17.854
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

00:17.889 --> 00:19.890
- You're hearing The Beast?
- I was getting duped.

00:19.924 --> 00:21.625
I'm Stanley.

00:21.659 --> 00:24.206
I'm your mentor.
Travelers are rare.

00:24.326 --> 00:25.893
- Where are we?
- The Neitherlands.

00:25.928 --> 00:27.628
The place between all other places.

00:27.663 --> 00:28.963
My friend's life is in danger,

00:28.997 --> 00:30.731
and I need to talk to you about Joe.

00:30.766 --> 00:34.135
Joe?
Oh, I love Joe.

00:34.169 --> 00:36.370
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

00:36.405 --> 00:37.595
How can I help?

00:37.715 --> 00:41.008
We are pushing the boundaries
of what is magically possible.

00:41.043 --> 00:43.311
We are the best Magicians we know.

<i>Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.</i>

00:48.784 --> 00:51.052
- You're trying to--
- Summon a god.

00:51.086 --> 00:52.887
Oh!

00:52.921 --> 00:54.855
I'm a member
of The Order, the keepers

00:54.890 --> 00:56.390
of the libraries of the Neitherlands,

00:56.425 --> 00:57.992
the greatest repository of knowledge.

00:58.026 --> 00:59.560
- Here it is.
- Wait, Martin?

00:59.594 --> 01:00.761
That's--okay, is there

01:00.796 --> 01:02.596
anything in there about The Beast?

01:07.703 --> 01:09.337
Go back to the part
where you literally

01:09.371 --> 01:11.072
popped in on them banging.

01:11.106 --> 01:12.740
We were casting a spell.

01:12.774 --> 01:15.576
- No judgment.
- We saved your life.

01:15.610 --> 01:17.611
All right, so there might
be a solution here.

01:17.646 --> 01:18.946
Uh, a weapon.

01:18.981 --> 01:20.181
It sounds like if we could find it,

01:20.215 --> 01:22.183
we could use it to kill The Beast.

01:22.217 --> 01:25.252
El! Jesus!

01:25.287 --> 01:27.288
It's 11:00 in the morning.

01:27.322 --> 01:28.923
I'm listening.

01:28.957 --> 01:32.193
So Martin's desperate,
'cause the Plover had

01:32.227 --> 01:33.961
figured out a way
to change physically,

01:33.996 --> 01:36.230
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

01:36.264 --> 01:38.399
which meant
that pretty soon he'd be able

01:38.433 --> 01:40.034
to follow Martin into Fillory.

01:40.068 --> 01:41.802
- [mumbles]
- Yeah.

01:41.837 --> 01:44.538
So Martin got a line

01:44.573 --> 01:47.241
on an enchanted knife, the Leo.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.076
Uh...

01:49.111 --> 01:50.811
Yeah, powerful enough to tear

01:50.846 --> 01:53.647
through the fabric of
magic itself--like, kill a god.

01:53.682 --> 01:58.419
So qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

01:58.453 --> 02:00.221
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

02:00.255 --> 02:01.789
I fucking love that guy.

02:01.823 --> 02:03.457
Yeah, so Martin
tracked down the knife maker,

02:03.492 --> 02:04.592
asked him if he could make him one,

02:04.626 --> 02:07.328
and the guy said,

02:07.362 --> 02:09.330
uh...

02:09.364 --> 02:12.066
"Yeah, I can."

02:12.100 --> 02:13.601
And then what?

02:13.635 --> 02:16.103
Uh, well, that's the end
of the pages.

02:16.138 --> 02:17.338
Yeah, nothing happened.

02:17.372 --> 02:18.639
If Martin killed The Beast,

02:18.673 --> 02:20.307
would we be here now
talking about him?

02:20.342 --> 02:22.243
Yeah, but here's the thing.

02:22.277 --> 02:24.812
So little did Martin know

02:24.846 --> 02:27.014
he would fail to recover the blade,

02:27.049 --> 02:28.649
which would remain hidden
for decades,

02:28.683 --> 02:30.523
which means it could still
be sitting somewhere

02:30.552 --> 02:32.119
waiting for us.

02:32.154 --> 02:34.989
Right, in Fillory.

02:35.023 --> 02:37.658
The place where The Beast is.

02:37.692 --> 02:40.628
Ergo, fuck that.

02:41.696 --> 02:44.598
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

02:44.633 --> 02:46.434
Plover wants the button back?

02:46.468 --> 02:48.035
Why don't we just give it to him?

02:48.070 --> 02:49.937
I--I don't think
that's a very good plan.

02:49.971 --> 02:51.772
No, that's
a monumentally shitty plan.

02:51.807 --> 02:53.307
I don't know.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.342
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

02:55.377 --> 02:58.012
So what if we hand them the button,

02:58.046 --> 02:59.513
thereby giving The Beast
what he wants,

02:59.548 --> 03:01.382
thereby rendering ourselves harmless,

03:01.416 --> 03:03.284
thereby he leaves us alone?

03:03.318 --> 03:05.119
Right, 'cause handing the key
to the multiverse to a monster

03:05.153 --> 03:06.854
is a really--
that's a good idea, Eliot.

03:06.888 --> 03:09.690
- Beats getting vivisected.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

03:09.724 --> 03:11.826
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel to Fillory

03:11.860 --> 03:14.495
so he keeps it all to himself,
I'm still a problem.

03:14.529 --> 03:18.365
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.668
The rest of us do not
have that luxury.

03:20.702 --> 03:23.137
So let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea

03:23.171 --> 03:24.572
out of bed.

03:24.606 --> 03:25.973
Okay, stop.

03:26.007 --> 03:28.242
This affects all of us.

03:28.276 --> 03:31.445
So those in favor of striking a deal.

03:39.588 --> 03:41.222
Sorry. It's the right move.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.429
Because you still seem,
I don't know, gloomy about it.

03:48.463 --> 03:50.431
I can't believe you're not.
Penny's been gone for a week.

03:50.465 --> 03:52.600
Which is like an hour
in the Neitherlands, right?

03:52.634 --> 03:55.769
It means nothing.
What if it works?

03:55.804 --> 03:58.405
Then it works. The Beast
leaves us alone, great.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.607
You're just upset 'cause
you may never get

03:59.641 --> 04:01.175
to go to Fillory.

04:01.209 --> 04:03.677
No, that would be stupid.

But yes.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.599
Find something high up enough
in the hierarchy,

08:53.634 --> 08:55.735
they might actually remember
when gods and humans

08:55.769 --> 08:57.169
were on speaking terms.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.938
And there's
a huge cross-section of them

08:58.972 --> 09:00.339
right here in the city.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.907
Yeah, because they want to use us.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.042
Look, you're right.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.343
Most of them know nothing other

09:04.378 --> 09:06.445
than hunger, thirst, and how to hide,

09:06.480 --> 09:08.748
but it's a food chain, all right?

09:08.782 --> 09:10.249
We start at the bottom;
we work our way up

09:10.283 --> 09:14.353
till we find someone
who can help us get to them.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.055
How long have you been at this?

09:16.089 --> 09:18.224
A while.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.725
I won't lie.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.461
You know, it's been tough going.

Bender, show them.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.268
Mostly bloodsuckers, useless junkies,

09:29.302 --> 09:32.238
but sometimes you can get
a lead on to something else.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.063
After they talk your ear off
for, like, 12 hours.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.478
Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

09:39.513 --> 09:43.482
but I think we have an ace
up our sleeve now.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.887
- Julia.
- What?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.922
That prayer I gave you, you know,

09:49.956 --> 09:52.258
doesn't work for everyone.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.093
Actually, you're the first.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.594
I don't understand.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.163
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

09:57.197 --> 10:00.166
but I gave you a test.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.402
Why? I'm not religious.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.905
I'm not a--I'm not anything.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.475
We don't know
why some people are god-touched.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.410
All right? There's
no rhyme or reason.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.447
Karma, DNA, luck of the draw.

10:14.481 --> 10:17.349
But it's you, Julia.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.319
I think if we send you on the hunt,

10:20.353 --> 10:22.088
we're gonna get some results.

- What are we planning?
- Nothing yet.

how we're all probably gonna die

10:35.402 --> 10:37.103

10:37.137 --> 10:39.939
because the Neitherlands
are full of mercenaries.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.474

39:57.318 --> 40:01.522
didn't just fix Rupert's leg.

40:01.556 --> 40:03.757
It healed him.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.293
All of him.

40:06.327 --> 40:09.930
There's this thing about you, Q.

40:09.964 --> 40:11.965
You actually believe in magic.

40:13.501 --> 40:17.638
- So does everyone.
- No.

40:17.672 --> 40:20.040
We all knows it's real,
but you believe in it.

40:23.211 --> 40:25.546
And you just love it,
pure and simple.

40:30.318 --> 40:35.389
You know, I've never loved
something like that.

40:39.327 --> 40:40.661
That's not true.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.835
Maybe Fillory can fix him.

40:51.372 --> 40:54.174
'Cause he's really not okay,
and he just doesn't care.

41:02.517 --> 41:05.886
It's okay.

41:05.920 --> 41:09.223
We're gonna do whatever we can.

41:09.257 --> 41:11.258
I promise.
