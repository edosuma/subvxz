Potkins do not simply

It's my only chance
for elf backup!

33:00.612 --> 33:03.613
Children, I'll be back.

33:03.716 --> 33:06.149
Remember, the microwave
and the garbage disposal

33:06.251 --> 33:07.884
are not your friends.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.423
Just touch the letters
that spell your name.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.092
Come on, you'll be famous.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.027
They'll put you
on the interwebs.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.962
[cooing]
You can do it,

33:19.064 --> 33:20.564
yes, you can...

33:20.666 --> 33:21.765
[kissing
and beckoning]

33:21.867 --> 33:22.867
Come on!

33:26.405 --> 33:28.171
Please, cuz, say something!

33:28.273 --> 33:29.740
Anything!
Grunt!

33:29.842 --> 33:30.907
Scream! Yodel!

33:31.844 --> 33:32.976
You know what,

33:33.078 --> 33:34.255
I'm coming in there after you.

33:34.279 --> 33:37.080
You saved my fanny-pack
back there,

33:37.182 --> 33:38.315
the least I can do is...

33:38.417 --> 33:39.616
[inhaling bravely]

33:39.718 --> 33:41.918
[groaning] Oh...

33:42.021 --> 33:43.553
for the love of humanity,

33:43.655 --> 33:45.555
what is she feeding this cat?

33:47.359 --> 33:48.658
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry, cuz,

33:48.761 --> 33:50.260
I thought I was strong enough,

33:50.362 --> 33:52.129
but the smell...

33:52.231 --> 33:53.430
The smell.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.436
I didn't deserve you.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.638
You were the best
fourth cousin I ever had.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.441
We didn't know
each other for long,

34:04.543 --> 34:06.910
but the times we had?

34:07.012 --> 34:08.945
Good times.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.583
[clears throat]

34:15.853 --> 34:17.654
You're alive!

34:21.726 --> 34:23.793
And you smell
like a cat toilet.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.395
Well, hold your nose.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.665
We've got
a table to climb.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.902
[gasping with effort]

34:35.007 --> 34:35.806
See?

34:35.908 --> 34:37.308
The cat-lady's phone
is on the desk.

34:37.376 --> 34:38.376
We can call for help.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.576
Okay, well,
we better hurry,

34:39.678 --> 34:42.879
because we have less than
two hours left...

34:42.981 --> 34:45.081
Whoa...

34:45.184 --> 34:46.983
Candy!

34:47.085 --> 34:50.387
Sweet monster-sized candy!

34:50.489 --> 34:52.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Barkley...

34:52.623 --> 34:54.391
stop acting
like Barkley@

34:54.493 --> 34:56.025
We're on a mission.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.928
Oh...

34:59.364 --> 35:00.230
Mayday!

35:00.332 --> 35:01.332
Mayday!

35:01.366 --> 35:03.467
Elf emergency alert!

35:03.569 --> 35:05.368
I can't find the sled.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.570
Does any elf copy?

35:11.810 --> 35:12.810
Don't go!

35:12.911 --> 35:14.611
I have a situation.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.521
<i>Whoa!
Watch out for that plane!</i>

35:32.064 --> 35:35.365
[forlornly] I'm not trained
for anything...

35:45.611 --> 35:47.911
Huh, the grandkids.

35:48.013 --> 35:50.714
They do the whole
pajama thing, too.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.318
I should've
taken that picture.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.020
We will.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.522
I promise.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.460
Uh... what are you doing?

36:03.562 --> 36:05.095
Gotta stretch out

roll my eyes.

- Can you see me?

Are you on your way?

You're still
at the airport?

the storm was that bad.

It's okay, Tinselpaws.

38:12.658 --> 38:15.125
They know how much
this visit means to us.

We just have to wait
a little while longer.

38:17.996 --> 38:18.662

38:18.764 --> 38:20.864
I need some candy.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.135

Right, Barkley?

38:28.974 --> 38:30.774
Barkley, where are you?

38:30.876 --> 38:32.042
Mm...

38:32.144 --> 38:33.843
It's so good!

38:35.514 --> 38:37.681
Stop eating the calendar!

38:37.783 --> 38:39.082
I can't stop myself.

38:39.184 --> 38:39.883
It's so much yum.

I've eaten my weight in sugar.

38:41.853 --> 38:42.893
My cavities have cavities.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.256
My blood runs thick
with chocolate.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.791
Uh... Barkley, this is bad.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.460
Old lady's eating her feelings.

You've gotta get out of there.

No!

38:53.799 --> 38:55.332
I won't leave my sweet babies!

38:55.434 --> 38:57.100
We could stay in the calendar,

38:57.202 --> 38:58.568
and live the sweet life,

38:58.670 --> 39:01.137
the milk chocolatey life.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.874
I need some chocolate.

She's coming.

You have to
get out of there.

You've got to get out of there!

39:35.073 --> 39:36.539
Don't worry!

39:36.641 --> 39:38.675
I mean, how much chocolate
can she eat?

39:41.780 --> 39:43.680
Chocolate-eating freak!

39:44.516 --> 39:45.648
This one's mine!

Not the dentures,
not the dentures!

Hey!

I guess a good night's sleep

40:22.354 --> 40:24.721
is something I'm not getting
for Christmas.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.964
The snow's really coming down.

40:35.066 --> 40:38.568
I bet it looks good
against all the lights I put up.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.203
The girls should see this.

40:40.305 --> 40:42.772
Crazy cat lady!

40:42.874 --> 40:44.507
Come back!

40:44.609 --> 40:47.143
You're our only hope!

40:48.580 --> 40:51.214
Emma, look.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.257
Wow.

...beautiful.

I mean, you can
almost see

41:10.902 --> 41:12.769
the individual flakes.

41:17.676 --> 41:21.344
My dad did a good job
with those lights.

Clock's ticking.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.924
What are we gonna do?

41:39.898 --> 41:43.766
I've got the most epic idea.

41:43.869 --> 41:45.401
Kids!

41:45.504 --> 41:47.036
You gotta see this!

41:47.138 --> 41:49.439
It's like
a winter wonderland.

41:51.576 --> 41:54.077
Kids?

41:58.517 --> 42:00.083
Yes, yes, an exterminator.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.484
Two of them!

42:01.586 --> 42:03.686
They were like tiny girls,

42:03.788 --> 42:04.687
only scary.

42:04.789 --> 42:07.056
Elves?

42:07.158 --> 42:08.191
[gasps]

42:08.293 --> 42:09.826
They were around the presents.

42:09.928 --> 42:12.295
And one of them
had a magic bag

42:12.397 --> 42:13.563
tied around its waist.

42:13.665 --> 42:14.665
My cat saw them, too.

42:14.766 --> 42:17.500
He might be able
to describe them better.

42:18.637 --> 42:19.802
Hello?

42:19.905 --> 42:21.504
Hello?

42:21.606 --> 42:22.906

42:23.008 --> 42:25.475
No, no, no, no, no...

42:29.381 --> 42:30.413
Kids?

42:32.284 --> 42:34.217
Kids!

42:34.319 --> 42:35.218
Kids!

42:35.320 --> 42:36.419
"Help"?

42:37.956 --> 42:39.822
You are here.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.424
Freeze!

42:42.594 --> 42:43.594
Easy...

42:44.529 --> 42:45.662
Is that tree loaded?

42:45.764 --> 42:47.630
Maybe.

42:47.732 --> 42:48.831
Who are you?

42:48.934 --> 42:49.999
Elfonso,

42:50.101 --> 42:52.669
the Elf... exterminator.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.103
I heard you had
a little problem.

42:54.205 --> 42:58.708
A very, very little problem.

42:58.810 --> 43:00.543
Where did you see
the elf infestation?

43:00.645 --> 43:02.178
The advent calendar.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.546
They were on my chocolate.

43:03.648 --> 43:05.682
Oh, no!

43:05.784 --> 43:08.818
Great Caesar's Snowballs!

43:08.920 --> 43:10.386
Are you in there, kids?

43:10.488 --> 43:11.254
Hang tight!

43:11.356 --> 43:12.767
I'll get some oatmeal
and prune juice,

43:12.791 --> 43:13.868
and have you out
in a few hours!

43:13.892 --> 43:15.758
[spluttering]

43:15.860 --> 43:17.327
I did not eat them.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.295
I don't think.

43:19.397 --> 43:22.665
My stomach has felt
a little funny.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.167
Probably just nerves.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.736
Tonight has not turned out
exactly as planned.

43:26.838 --> 43:28.004
Fear not!

43:28.106 --> 43:31.007
Elfonso, the great Elf,
Gnome, and Leprechaun chaser

43:31.109 --> 43:32.141
is on the hunt.

43:32.243 --> 43:34.043
If they're here,
I'll find them.

43:34.145 --> 43:35.244

my expert eye.

It's them!

43:50.996 --> 43:52.996
They're... flying?

43:53.098 --> 43:54.797
That copter was
for my grandson!

43:54.899 --> 43:55.798
Thieves!

43:55.900 --> 43:57.433
Stop them!

43:57.535 --> 43:59.202
The remote.

43:59.304 --> 44:00.803
No!

44:00.905 --> 44:02.338
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

No!

If you don't mind?

44:04.342 --> 44:05.342
Give it to me!

44:06.578 --> 44:07.578
No!

44:09.848 --> 44:12.248

44:16.955 --> 44:17.955
[arguing]

44:18.023 --> 44:19.088
Give me that!

44:20.892 --> 44:21.892
You can't!

44:23.028 --> 44:24.193
They'll crash!

44:25.964 --> 44:27.430

44:42.013 --> 44:44.647

Christmas... still hard.

44:47.052 --> 44:48.384
Emma?

44:49.587 --> 44:50.653
Em?

44:53.425 --> 44:55.124
Emma?

44:56.661 --> 44:58.494
Where are you, Em?

44:58.596 --> 45:00.763
[♪♪♪]

45:11.009 --> 45:14.177
My snot has turned
to snow boogers.

45:18.983 --> 45:21.718
Well, that plan
went bust.

45:21.820 --> 45:22.820
You think?

45:22.887 --> 45:24.053
We're done.

45:24.155 --> 45:25.521
We'll never
make it now.

45:25.623 --> 45:27.523
Don't worry, cuz.

45:27.625 --> 45:28.891
I got a plan.

45:28.993 --> 45:30.760
Two words,

45:30.862 --> 45:31.928
snowball...

45:32.030 --> 45:32.929
cannon.

45:33.031 --> 45:34.497
Please stop.

45:34.599 --> 45:35.431
Wait,

45:35.533 --> 45:37.366
is "snowball cannon"
three words?

45:37.469 --> 45:38.501
Who cares?

45:38.603 --> 45:39.603
It's crazy!

45:39.704 --> 45:42.038
Like riding quad-copters,

45:42.140 --> 45:43.272
or wearing fanny-packs,

45:43.374 --> 45:44.807
or tickle-feathers.

45:44.909 --> 45:46.476
The only reason we're here

45:46.578 --> 45:48.344
is 'cause you wanted
to hang my stocking

45:48.446 --> 45:50.113
from a DVR'd Fireplace!

45:50.215 --> 45:51.647
I just wanted to help.

45:51.750 --> 45:52.915
Well, stop,

45:53.017 --> 45:55.785
'cause your help
isn't helpful.

45:57.055 --> 45:58.154
It's a disaster.

45:59.324 --> 46:03.126
It's no wonder you never had
a walkie-talkie buddy.

46:16.508 --> 46:18.274
You're right.

46:18.376 --> 46:20.409
I pushed too hard.

46:20.512 --> 46:23.179
I had to go
full Barkley.

46:25.250 --> 46:28.918
It's just that my parents
are always on the move,

46:29.020 --> 46:32.755
and I've never had
a real Christmas,

46:32.857 --> 46:34.390
so I wanted this
to be special.

46:34.492 --> 46:37.493
You know, with stockings
hung by the chimney,

46:37.595 --> 46:39.328
and presents
under the tree,

46:39.430 --> 46:43.332
and family and friends.

46:44.435 --> 46:48.337
I've never even had
a real friend.

46:48.439 --> 46:49.739
But when I met you,

46:49.841 --> 46:53.042
I thought that maybe...

46:53.144 --> 46:54.677
It's stupid.

46:57.248 --> 47:00.316
No, it's not stupid.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.785
I'm just being a Grinch.

47:05.023 --> 47:07.156
I needed a friend, too.

47:07.258 --> 47:09.292
I never expected...

47:09.394 --> 47:12.662
this, exactly, but...

47:12.764 --> 47:14.063
it's growing on me.

47:14.165 --> 47:16.032
And not totally
in a fungal way.

47:16.134 --> 47:17.900
[laughing]

47:22.373 --> 47:24.807
I should've just
hung my stocking

47:24.909 --> 47:26.342
from the stupid TV.

47:26.444 --> 47:28.711
It really is a great stocking.

47:29.881 --> 47:31.280
Mom made it.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.516
She rocked Christmas.

47:33.618 --> 47:34.684
Every year,

47:34.786 --> 47:37.720
she got my dad these
insanely hideous sweaters.

47:37.822 --> 47:39.555
Itchy, disgusting ones.

47:39.657 --> 47:40.857
[chuckles]

47:40.959 --> 47:42.358
I got my dad one
this year,

47:42.460 --> 47:44.894
for old times sake.

47:44.996 --> 47:46.863
It's so gross.

47:46.965 --> 47:49.298
It's under the tree
right now.

47:55.506 --> 47:59.275
She loved Christmas
so much.

47:59.377 --> 48:03.412
It hasn't the same
without her.

48:08.052 --> 48:09.418
Maybe not the same.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.787
But it doesn't mean
it can't be good.

48:18.196 --> 48:19.629
You're right.

48:19.731 --> 48:21.230
It's Christmas,

48:21.332 --> 48:23.165
anything's possible!

48:23.268 --> 48:25.028
Especially with a friend
who's got your back.

48:26.671 --> 48:29.138
I feel a heartfelt
hug coming on.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.107
And right back
to full Barkley.

48:31.209 --> 48:32.875
Oh, you know
you love it.

48:32.977 --> 48:33.977
Hey!

48:34.078 --> 48:35.211
[screaming]

48:35.313 --> 48:36.612

48:39.484 --> 48:41.384
Upside,

48:41.486 --> 48:43.386
Downside,
impossible to find earmuffs,

48:43.488 --> 48:44.488
and headphones.

48:44.555 --> 48:46.289
The elf,
he's talking to us.

48:46.391 --> 48:47.391
I'm really sorry

48:47.458 --> 48:49.258
about the whole
shrink-ray-snafu.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.694
Totally my bad.

48:51.796 --> 48:52.561
I'm a tech guy.

48:52.664 --> 48:54.630
I usually work
behind the scenes.

48:54.732 --> 48:56.766
I've never even been
up this late on Christmas Eve.

48:56.868 --> 48:59.635
We are so doomed.

48:59.737 --> 49:01.704
But I am gonna Christmas-up,
and save the day.

49:01.806 --> 49:05.508
We are going to your house
to find my unshrinking goggles.

49:07.178 --> 49:09.412
Ah! Easy with the grip
there, fella!

49:21.559 --> 49:24.026
Blech!
Sweaty-hat-head!

49:24.128 --> 49:25.661
Dude needs some
serious conditioner.

49:25.763 --> 49:27.630
Yeah, but have you
felt this elf skin?

49:27.732 --> 49:28.732
So smooth.

49:28.800 --> 49:29.999
Like a baby.

49:31.002 --> 49:32.468
What, are you
Irish dancing in there?

49:32.570 --> 49:33.769
You're making me itch.

49:33.871 --> 49:34.904
Again, conditioner.

49:40.278 --> 49:40.977
What are you doing?

49:41.079 --> 49:42.712
[yelps in fright]

49:44.782 --> 49:46.427
How could you possibly
have gotten here so fast?

49:46.451 --> 49:48.017
You're like a granny ninja!

49:48.119 --> 49:49.285
See, Tinselpaws?

49:49.387 --> 49:50.753
I'm not crazy!

49:50.855 --> 49:51.855
I caught the elf!

49:51.889 --> 49:55.057
Now, where is
my grandson's toy?

49:55.159 --> 49:56.592
Toy?

49:56.694 --> 49:58.761
Um...

49:58.863 --> 50:00.296
Look!

50:00.398 --> 50:01.297
A flying reindeer!

50:01.399 --> 50:03.432
- Huh?
- See ya!

50:04.702 --> 50:05.835
Stop!

50:05.937 --> 50:06.937
Kids!

50:06.971 --> 50:08.037
Run for the house!

50:08.139 --> 50:09.538

50:25.089 --> 50:26.188
We should
do something.

50:26.290 --> 50:27.456
He's a big boy.

50:27.558 --> 50:29.225
Big enough to not be
eaten by owls.

50:30.328 --> 50:31.727

Okay, uh...

50:42.206 --> 50:43.773
I thought you elves

50:43.875 --> 50:45.374
were supposed
to give presents,

50:45.476 --> 50:46.675
not steal them.

50:46.778 --> 50:48.411
That copter
was a special surprise

50:48.513 --> 50:49.678
for my grandson.

50:49.781 --> 50:50.579
I need it!

50:50.681 --> 50:52.415
Well, hopefully
you got a gift receipt?

of a few tiny things.

51:06.164 --> 51:08.097
Closing the airport?

51:08.199 --> 51:09.265
For a little snow?

51:09.367 --> 51:10.833
But what about
the food,

51:10.935 --> 51:11.967
the presents?

51:12.070 --> 51:14.003
A blizzard.

51:14.105 --> 51:16.672
I see.

51:16.774 --> 51:17.940
Well...

51:18.042 --> 51:22.344
maybe we'll see each other
in the New Year.

51:22.447 --> 51:24.580
Or in the summer,

51:24.682 --> 51:26.549
when the kids are off school.

51:28.920 --> 51:29.685
Love you.

51:29.787 --> 51:32.888
Hug my grandbabies for me.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.095
Well,

51:39.197 --> 51:41.997
I guess I won't be needing
that copter after all.

52:03.754 --> 52:06.155
She's gonna be
all alone.

52:06.257 --> 52:08.224
On Christmas.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.259
Come on, cuz.

We're so close.

We cannot be related.

the back window?

53:08.719 --> 53:11.120

53:11.222 --> 53:13.189
Point is, we're home.

But not home free.

Ten and a half minutes left!

We need to find those goggles.

53:19.730 --> 53:20.774
They had flashing
lights on them..

53:20.798 --> 53:21.997
Look for those.

This should help.

she might be trying to head
back home for Christmas.

Yes, I've searched everywhere.

All right,
all we've gotta do

Yeah, it could really use
a little bit more pep.

I'll work on it.

[wincing]
Ah, I can't watch.

56:32.289 --> 56:34.256
I'm stuck!

56:34.358 --> 56:35.358
Take your shoe off!

56:37.762 --> 56:39.228
Darn you, discount pleather.

56:49.273 --> 56:50.939
[horn blaring]

56:51.041 --> 56:52.875
This is gonna leave a mark.

56:57.381 --> 56:59.848
[horn blaring]

57:03.521 --> 57:05.454
Did I do that...

57:05.556 --> 57:07.689
with my mind?

57:07.792 --> 57:08.690
No, I did it.

57:08.793 --> 57:10.359
With my hand.

57:10.461 --> 57:12.694
I just realized this thing
was a train switch

57:12.797 --> 57:13.896
Oh.

57:22.540 --> 57:23.572
Tiny-peeps?

57:23.674 --> 57:25.607
Are you in there?

57:35.920 --> 57:37.486
Let me guess,

57:37.588 --> 57:38.588
another Elf-o-gram.

57:44.995 --> 57:46.328
Let's Christmas.

57:46.430 --> 57:47.563
Like a boss.

57:53.571 --> 57:55.204
The kids are in here.

57:55.306 --> 57:56.205
The kids?

57:56.307 --> 57:57.673
My kids?

57:57.775 --> 57:58.907
Where?

58:07.051 --> 58:10.118
What are we gonna do
when we reach the goggles?

58:10.221 --> 58:12.988
I mean, our tiny fingers
can't work the buttons.

58:13.090 --> 58:13.889
You're right.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.524
We need to signal my dad.

58:15.626 --> 58:18.093
But... how?

58:23.501 --> 58:27.870
[ornament clattering]

58:28.873 --> 58:30.005
[shatters]

58:31.308 --> 58:32.341
It's them.

58:32.443 --> 58:33.443
They're in the tree!

58:35.412 --> 58:37.212
The goggles!

58:38.015 --> 58:39.781
[groans, yelping]

58:39.884 --> 58:41.683
[screams]

58:42.853 --> 58:45.220
[groaning]

58:53.664 --> 58:54.730
I'm slipping.

58:54.832 --> 58:56.798
I think I can reach you.

58:56.901 --> 58:59.501
All you gotta do
is grab my hand.

58:59.603 --> 59:00.603
But your stocking!

59:00.704 --> 59:03.605
It could be lost forever.

59:03.707 --> 59:04.707
Barkley...

59:05.643 --> 59:07.609
it's okay.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.281
Is there going to be
a countdown...

59:12.383 --> 59:13.383
Now!

59:26.030 --> 59:27.629
Wow.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.131
I can't believe that worked.

59:30.134 --> 59:32.301
I've got a really crazy idea.

59:39.977 --> 59:41.410
The ugly Christmas sweater?

59:42.413 --> 59:44.046
I mean, this is crazy,
even for me.

59:44.148 --> 59:45.514
I knew you'd dig it.

59:45.616 --> 59:47.783
It's been an honor
Christmassing with you.

59:49.453 --> 59:51.320
[screaming]

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.331
Saved by
the sweater.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:06.034
Aw, it itches so bad!

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:08.637
Oh, scratch my face,
scratch my face!

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:10.505
[screaming]

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.212
Girls?

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:19.081
How is this possible?

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.083
Are you all right?

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:27.522
Dad!

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:28.657
40 seconds!

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:31.727
We need to hurry!

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:32.829
Back up!

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:35.097
Dawn is coming!

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.833
I can't watch!

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:38.767
Neither can I!

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:39.901
The sun!

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:42.204
It's Christmas morning,
we're out of time!

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:45.874
[laser zapping]

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.443
[♪♪♪]

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:00.455
I feel taller.

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:02.424
Hey, could you give me
another zap?

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.126
You know, give the old
basketball career

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:05.093
a little boost?

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:06.294
No problem!

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:07.529
Whoa!

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:08.964
Stop while you're ahead.

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:10.565
[sighing in relief]

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.007
If anything had happened
to the two of you...

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.941
It's my fault.

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:21.309
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:23.945
I've been a total
Emma-neezer Scrooge.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.714
I shouldn't have
made you move here.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:28.016
Dad, it's just...

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:28.950
different.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:32.054
But different can be good.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.755
Different can be awesome.

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.226
You know, there are
actually gifts

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:39.194
under here, too.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:40.762
You might need
a magnifying glass

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:42.197
and tweezers
to open them.

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:43.565
I could zap them.

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:44.700
[together]: No!

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:45.701
Whoa.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.035
Okay then.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.471
I guess it's
yell-at-the-elf-day.

01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:50.839
Wait.

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:52.174
The sun is up.

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:53.809
Why do the goggles
still have power?

01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:55.151
[clatter of hooves on the roof]

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.892
[incoming call chimes,
"Jingle Bells" tune]

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.081
Chill!

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:00.749
I let you down.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:02.584
Christmas Eve is over.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:03.919
<i>Not everywhere.</i>

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:05.754
<i>Hawaii, for example.</i>

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:07.367
<i>We still have a few hours
on the clock.</i>

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:08.391
<i>You invented this stuff.</i>

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:09.591
<i>How do you not know that?</i>

01:02:09.693 --> 01:02:11.026
I've never field-tested,

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:12.027
<i>We're on the roof.</i>

01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:13.195
<i>Get up here!</i>

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:16.098
<i>We've got a ton of toys
to deliver to Maui.</i>

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.200
<i>And you are piloting the sled.</i>

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:21.737
Me?

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.105
For reals?

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:24.473
Sled pilot?

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:27.309
<i>It was gonna be a surprise.</i>

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:29.211
<i>For all the work you've done
over the years.</i>

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.246
<i>We all bought crash helmets.</i>

01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:32.348
[laughs in delight]

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.216
I'll be right there!

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:36.752
<i>Ah, we did it, boys.</i>

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:40.789
<i>[voice breaking]
I love the holidays.</i>

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.060
Oh, hey,

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.494
let's just, uh...

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.629
keep this
on the down-low,

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:48.930
okay?

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:50.632
What happens on Christmas

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:51.933
stays on Christmas.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:55.170
Aloha.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:03.946
[thuds, groaning]

01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:07.716
[groans]
Christmas remains hard!

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:11.186
He really needs to learn
how to use the door.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.921
Mm-hmm.

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:14.289
Should we open
some presents?

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.361
[doorbell rings]

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:22.130
[gasps] Giant elves!

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:24.132
Tinselpaws, attack!

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:26.234
Wait!
We come in peace!

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.570
I'm your new neighbor,

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:30.205
from across
the street?

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.307
We were wondering

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:34.242
if you might want to come over

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:37.279
and be part of
our Christmas tradition?

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.649
You can bring
your psychic cat.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:48.890
[♪♪♪]

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:58.433
Ah, a microscope.

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:01.002
Maybe now I can
find our couch.

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:03.538
[laughing]

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640
Oh.

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:07.042
Hey, this one's for us.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.677
"From Elfonso.

01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:10.378
"It was stuck to my shoe
when I left,

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.013
figured it was worth
unshrinking."

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:22.931
I think there's
something underneath.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.026
Oh.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:26.494
[gasping]

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:29.831
Our walkies!

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.107
And something for you.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.209
What?

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:41.877
Maybe I'll open it.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:42.711
[chuckles]

01:04:42.813 --> 01:04:44.713
Oh, my...

01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:45.815
[chuckles]

01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:49.885
[gasping in awe]

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:51.052
They're...

01:04:53.824 --> 01:04:56.892
...glorious!

01:04:56.994 --> 01:04:58.760
[sighing in delight] Oh...!

01:04:58.862 --> 01:05:01.162
Tinselpaws...

01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:03.164
[cooing fondly]
It's your color...

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:05.066
Yes, indeed.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.974
We should take a picture.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.576
[shutter clicking]

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:18.046
[all together]:
Merry Christmas!
