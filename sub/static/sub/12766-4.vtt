05:25.083 --> 05:27.041
COMBINED WITH THE LACK OF ENERGY
AND APPETITE,

05:27.083 --> 05:29.208
COULD BE MONONUCLEOSIS.

HAVE YOU BEEN KISSING SOMEONE?

05:32.083 --> 05:33.208

08:22.792 --> 08:25.417
DID YOU JUST WALK
RIGHT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL?

08:25.458 --> 08:27.083
WE HAD TO GET OUT
OF THERE.

08:27.125 --> 08:29.417
WE? YOU AND...

08:29.458 --> 08:31.750
ME AND MY BABY.

08:31.792 --> 08:34.166
THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL US.

08:42.208 --> 08:44.041
I SAW YOU ON TV.

08:44.083 --> 08:48.000
THOSE THINGS YOU SAID
ABOUT LISTENING TO THE PATIENT,

08:48.041 --> 08:49.333
WAS THAT JUST TV CRAP?

08:49.375 --> 08:52.000
NO, I MEANT IT.

08:52.041 --> 08:55.041
EXCEPT FOR
THE ARM &amp; HAMMER PART.

08:55.083 --> 08:57.166
SO YOU SAID THE HOSPITAL'S
TRYING TO KILL YOU?

08:57.208 --> 08:59.250
EVERYTHING THEY DO
JUST MAKES ME SICKER.

08:59.291 --> 09:02.208
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?
FIVE MONTHS.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.208
I KNOW I LOOK THIN,
BUT I'M EATING. I AM.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.667
I'VE ALWAYS HAD STOMACH STUFF,
THIS PAIN,

09:07.709 --> 09:09.667

WHAT'S WRONG.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.458
I... I'M DOING WHAT YOU SAID,
DR. BENNETT.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.458
I'M LISTENING TO MY BODY,
BUT NOBODY BELIEVES ME.

09:14.500 --> 09:18.166
ALL RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME
YOUR NAME AND YOUR HOSPITAL?

09:18.208 --> 09:21.041
I'LL TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.041
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.542
YOU SCRATCHED YOUR NAME
OFF YOUR HOSPITAL BRACELET?

09:27.917 --> 09:30.208
SHE WON'T GIVE US
ANY OF HER INFORMATION.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.208
SHE'S AFRAID
WE'RE GONNA SEND HER BACK.
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT,
WE'RE SENDING HER BACK.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.709
I'M GONNA GET DELL TO CALL
ALL THE AREA HOSPITALS.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.417
SHE CAME HERE
BECAUSE OF SAM.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.625
SHE WAS INSPIRED
BY DR. SAM.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.500
WELL, THEN SHE'S GONNA WANT
TO GO BACK,

09:41.542 --> 09:43.667
BECAUSE DR. SAM IS AN IDIOT.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.041
I'D LIKE TO RUN SOME TESTS.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.250
OKAY, FINE. BUT JUST UNTIL
WE FIGURE OUT WHERE SHE BELONGS.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.542
YOU HAD TO GO ON TV.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.375
THANK YOU, SAM.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.834
DOES SHE SEEM A LITTLE--
DID YOU RSVP TO HER THING?

09:57.875 --> 09:59.834
OH.
YEAH.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.041
(Stan) THE DAMN FLOOR
GOT OFF BALANCE.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.083
WERE YOU DIZZY
RIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENED?

10:05.125 --> 10:07.291
MAYBE A LITTLE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM?

10:07.333 --> 10:10.834
IS HE GONNA HAVE TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL?
STAN, I'D LIKE
TO SEND YOU DOWNSTAIRS

10:10.875 --> 10:12.542
AND RUN SOME BASIC TESTS.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.709
WE'LL GET AN E.K.G.,
AN M.R.I.,

10:14.750 --> 10:17.333
AND SEE IF WE FIND ANYTHING.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.583
YOU FIX STAN, HEAR ME?

10:23.625 --> 10:28.709
LIKE I SAID,
HE'S MY ONE AND ONLY.

10:28.750 --> 10:31.041
HEY, I'VE GOT
A 70-YEAR-OLD MALE

10:31.083 --> 10:32.500
PRESENTING WITH SYNCOPE.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.542
THESE WHAT YOU'D RUN?

10:34.583 --> 10:37.291
OKAY, HE'S HYPERTENSIVE,
DIABETIC--

10:37.333 --> 10:39.333
COULD BE A T.I.A.
OR AN OCCULT ARRHYTHMIA.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.375
I HOPE NOT.

10:41.417 --> 10:43.250
OKAY. THANKS.

10:43.291 --> 10:46.542
YEAH. OH, YOU SHOULD RSVP
FOR ADDISON'S THING.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.542
SHE'S STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE SQUIRRELLY.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.458
YEAH... I'M NOT SURE.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.250
SHE'S GETTING TO YOU.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.000
SHE IS NOT.

10:54.041 --> 10:55.208
(laughs)

10:55.250 --> 10:57.417
I'M NOT GOING THERE.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.709
(laughs) SHE'S DEFINITELY
GETTING TO YOU.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.583
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE MONO?

11:02.625 --> 11:05.375
TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
OH, THANK GOD.

11:05.417 --> 11:08.375
I'M GONNA CALL DAD.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.750
YOU DON'T SEEM TOO HAPPY.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.375
YOU HOPING
FOR A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE?

11:12.417 --> 11:14.709
I KNEW I DIDN'T HAVE IT.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.709
I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.000
WHAT'S THAT?

11:19.041 --> 11:21.291
(sighs) I'M IN LOVE.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.834
AND WHAT, IS THAT AWFUL?
IT'S GREAT, RIGHT?

11:23.875 --> 11:25.834
NOT WHEN THE PERSON
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH

11:25.875 --> 11:27.375
DOESN'T LIKE YOU BACK.

11:27.417 --> 11:28.667
OH. WHO IS SHE?

11:28.709 --> 11:30.417
SOMEONE AT THE SKATE PARK.

11:30.458 --> 11:32.417
DOES SHE KNOW YOU LIKE HER?

11:32.458 --> 11:35.458
(scoffs) NO. IF I TELL,
IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.041
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
DON'T YOU GOTTA GO FOR IT?

11:39.083 --> 11:41.542
I MEAN, ASK HER TO DO SOMETHING
OR HANG OUT OR...

11:41.583 --> 11:43.041
YEAH,
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

11:43.083 --> 11:45.208
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO MESS EVERYTHING UP.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.208
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S GONNA BE EASY.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.250
I MEAN, I KNOW.
I'VE... I GOTTA...

11:49.291 --> 11:50.417
WHAT?

11:50.458 --> 11:52.041
UM...

11:52.083 --> 11:55.041
THIS GIRL I LIKE, I BEEN
TRYING TO GET UP THE NERVE

11:55.083 --> 11:57.417
TO SAY SOMETHING
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:57.458 --> 11:59.166
I MEAN, A LONG TIME.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.875
FOR REAL?

12:00.917 --> 12:01.834
YEAH.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.166
(sighs)

12:04.208 --> 12:06.500
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
A PACT--

12:06.542 --> 12:08.834
I'LL DO IT IF YOU DO IT.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.250
WE'LL SPILL OUR GUTS,
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.291
PACT.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.500
BOOM.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.834
VIOLET?

12:30.875 --> 12:33.083
WHY IS CAMI DAVIS HERE?
I MEAN, WHY WAS SHE SEEING YOU?

12:33.125 --> 12:34.625
VIOLET...

12:34.667 --> 12:37.458
I KNOW.
BUT WHY WAS SHE HERE?

12:37.500 --> 12:40.417
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
OKAY, DON'T TELL ME.

12:40.458 --> 12:43.458
I WILL TELL YOU
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW.
NO.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.834
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY,
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

12:45.875 --> 12:47.333
DON'T TELL ME.

12:47.375 --> 12:50.250
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SMART
AND IT'S UNHEALTHY,

12:50.291 --> 12:52.458
AND I SHOULD
MIND MY OWN BUSINESS.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.959
SWEAR YOU WON'T TELL ME.
I SWEAR.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.583
OKAY.

13:05.291 --> 13:08.041
YOU OKAY?

13:08.083 --> 13:10.500
WHAT IF...

13:10.542 --> 13:12.875
STAN DOESN'T REALLY
WANT TO MARRY ME?

13:12.917 --> 13:15.041
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.542
THESE ATTACKS, WHAT IF
THEY'RE CAUSED BY STRESS

13:17.583 --> 13:20.041
ABOUT GETTING HITCHED TO ME
FOR LIFE?

13:20.083 --> 13:23.041
SYLVIE, THERE ARE A LOT
OF POSSIBLE REASONS THIS--

13:23.083 --> 13:25.500
THEY STARTED RIGHT AFTER
HE PROPOSED.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.041
HEY, I JUST CHECKED
ON OUR JANE DOE.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
CHECKING ON MY PATIENT?

13:31.083 --> 13:33.000
THIS IS NOT MIDWIFF SCHOOL--

13:33.041 --> 13:35.041
SHE'S HAVING CONTRACTIONS.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.583
OH. IS THE BABY OKAY?

13:37.625 --> 13:40.041
THE MEDICATION I'M GIVING YOU
WILL STOP THE CONTRACTIONS.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.625
JUST FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.041
OKAY. BREATHING.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.792
HERE WE GO.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.583
THE FETAL WEIGHT IS LOW
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.583
BUT...

13:53.625 --> 13:57.041
THE HEARTBEAT IS PRESENT

13:57.083 --> 14:00.041
AND STRONG... FOR NOW.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.959
NOBODY THOUGHT
I COULD GET PREGNANT.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.375
NOT MY DOCTORS, MY BOYFRIEND.

14:05.417 --> 14:08.375
MY BODY'S BEEN MESSED UP
MY WHOLE LIFE.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.125
THIS BABY...

14:10.166 --> 14:12.208
IT'S A MIRACLE.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.041
(scoffs) TOTAL CLICHé,
RIGHT?

14:17.083 --> 14:20.166
NO.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.542
NO, I GET IT.

14:22.583 --> 14:26.458
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.000
I CAN'T LOSE MY BABY.

14:30.041 --> 14:32.750
I HEAR YOU HAVE SOMETHING
OF OURS.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.959
SHE CAME HERE ON HER OWN,
AND WE CALLED YOU

14:35.000 --> 14:37.041
AND EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL
IN THE CITY

14:37.083 --> 14:39.625
TO TRY AND FIND OUT
WHERE SHE CAME FROM.
YOU KNOW OUR JANE DOE?

14:39.667 --> 14:42.041
HER NAME'S REBECCA HOBART,
AND I'M GOING TO ARRANGE

14:42.083 --> 14:44.458
TRANSPORTATION BACK TO
ST. AMBROSE IMMEDIATELY.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.458
REBECCA WANTS TO STAY HERE.
WE ARE KEEPING HER.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.500
IS THAT SO? I THINK YOUR GUEST
LEFT OUT MORE THAN HER NAME.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:50.542 --> 14:52.792
REBECCA HOBART'S A 5150.

14:52.834 --> 14:55.041
SHE'S ON INVOLUNTARY HOLD?
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.083
THE PATIENT YOU ARE
AIDING AND ABETTING,

14:57.125 --> 14:59.417
SHE'S STRAIGHT OUT OF
THE PSYCH WARD.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.917
SHE... SHE DOESN'T
SEEM CRAZY TO ME.

15:07.959 --> 15:09.458
SHE'S VERY CONVINCING,

15:09.500 --> 15:11.291
LIKE ALL
GOOD MUNCHAUSEN PATIENTS.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.291
WAIT, MUNCHAUSEN?

15:13.333 --> 15:15.583
SHE'S MAKING HERSELF SICK
FOR THE ATTENTION?

15:15.625 --> 15:18.083
SHE'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF
PSYCH WARDS SINCE SHE WAS 18.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.917
JOINT PAIN, STOMACH PROBLEMS--
ALL KINDS OF VAGUE SYMPTOMS,

15:20.959 --> 15:23.250
BUT HER TESTS
DON'T BACK HER UP.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.458
MAYBE, BUT SHE WANTS
TO BE TREATED HERE.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.125
HER MOTHER
IS HER MEDICAL GUARDIAN.

15:27.166 --> 15:30.125
UNDER STATE LAW, IF HER MOTHER
WANTS HER BACK AT THE HOSPITAL,

15:30.166 --> 15:33.041
REBECCA GOES BACK.
AGREED. SHE GOES.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.875
SHE'S HAVING CONTRACTIONS.

15:34.917 --> 15:37.041
YOU WANT TO MOVE HER NOW,

15:37.083 --> 15:40.583
MAKE HER LOSE THE BABY,
BE MY GUEST.

15:43.083 --> 15:46.041
WHY WOULD YOU LIGHT A FIRE
UNDER CHARLOTTE KING'S ASS

15:46.083 --> 15:47.667
FOR A 5150?

15:47.709 --> 15:49.667
I OUGHTA 5150 YOUR SKINNY--
REBECCA IS NOT--

15:49.709 --> 15:52.083
HAVE YOU EVEN TALKED TO HER?
I BELIEVE HER.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.959
MUNCHAUSEN. THESE PEOPLE ARE
EXCEPTIONAL, SPECTACULAR LIARS.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.959
YOU TWO, MAYBE WE COULD
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.
PEOPLE GET ANGRY, SAM.
IT'S NORMAL.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.041
SAM IS JUST TRYING TO HELP.
SAM DOESN'T LIKE CONFLICT.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.208
WHOA, LADIES. OFF TOPIC.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.000
(sighs)

16:05.041 --> 16:08.709
I THINK VIOLET SHOULD DO
A PSYCH EVAL ON REBECCA.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.542
THE WOMAN HAS A LONG,
DOCUMENTED HISTORY--

16:11.583 --> 16:13.583
SAM, DO YOU AGREE WITH ME?

16:13.625 --> 16:16.000
YOUR NEXT PATIENT
IS IN ROOM TWO.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.250
BLESS YOU, DELL.
ADDISON.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.750
ADDISON.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.500
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING
SO HARD FOR THIS WOMAN?

16:22.542 --> 16:24.750
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
GIVE UP ON PEOPLE?

16:24.792 --> 16:27.250
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.750
WELL, DON'T.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.542
HEY, ADDISON.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.375
I'M COMING, OKAY?

16:32.417 --> 16:35.792
DON'T TELL ME THIS IS BECAUSE
I FORGOT TO RSVP TO YOUR PARTY.

16:35.834 --> 16:39.291
CAN I ASK VIOLET
TO DO THE PSYCH EVAL OR NOT?

16:39.333 --> 16:40.792
FINE.

16:45.375 --> 16:48.125
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER SHRINK.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.792
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT THE PSYCH WARD.
I NEED YOU
TO BE OFF YOUR FEET.

16:50.834 --> 16:54.834
YOUR CONTRACTIONS
JUST EASED UP.
IF NO ONE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME,

16:54.875 --> 16:56.959
THEY'LL KEEP SAYING
I'M CRAZY,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.583
AND THEY'LL TAKE MY BABY
AWAY FROM ME.
WE ARE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN

17:00.625 --> 17:02.166
TO KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING.

17:02.208 --> 17:06.000
BUT WE NEED YOU TO HELP US.
NOW COME ON. SIT DOWN.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.709
TALK.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.792
MY FIRST MARRIAGE
WAS LONELY.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.041
YOU KNOW.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.417
I CAN'T GET STUCK
IN ANOTHER MARRIAGE

17:21.458 --> 17:23.667
WITH A MAN
WHO DOESN'T LOVE ME.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.792
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
STAN DOESN'T LOVE YOU?

17:25.834 --> 17:27.792
WELL, I'M NOT...
I DON'T KNOW.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.458
I...

17:29.500 --> 17:33.458
HE COULD JUST BE USING ME
FOR THE SEX, I SUPPOSE.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.875
THE--THE SEX?

17:35.917 --> 17:37.792
WE HAVE DAMN GOOD SEX.

17:37.834 --> 17:40.792
SYLVIE,
YOUR FIRST MARRIAGE...

17:40.834 --> 17:44.083
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH STAN.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.041
YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T LET THE PAST

17:46.083 --> 17:47.667
HANG OVER YOU LIKE THAT.

17:47.709 --> 17:50.500
NEITHER CAN YOU, KID.

17:50.542 --> 17:53.709
YOU'RE NOT AS SCREWED UP
AS I AM.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.041
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.583
BUT BE HONEST, PETE.

17:59.625 --> 18:03.291
THE TIMING OF THESE SPELLS
AND THE PROPOSAL...

18:03.333 --> 18:05.000
PRETTY DAMNING, ISN'T IT?

18:08.667 --> 18:10.625
OKAY, I KNOW
I SEEM LIKE THIS GUY

18:10.667 --> 18:12.709
THAT DATES WOMEN
FROM THE INTERNET--

18:12.750 --> 18:15.709
OKAY, I AM THIS GUY THAT DATES
WOMEN FROM THE INTERNET,

18:15.750 --> 18:17.041
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE...

18:17.083 --> 18:19.041
NO, SCRAP THAT.
NO GOOD. OKAY.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.125
UM, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
AND YOU'RE FUNNY

18:21.166 --> 18:24.250
AND... WELL, YOU'RE ANNOYING,

18:24.291 --> 18:27.250
BUT IN A WAY THAT'S ENDEARING
WHEN IT'S NOT DRIVING ME CRAZY.

18:27.291 --> 18:28.709
AND THE POINT IS--

18:28.750 --> 18:32.875
THE POINT IS...
I LOVE YOU.

18:32.917 --> 18:37.041
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND HAVE BEEN FOR...

18:37.083 --> 18:38.750
EVER.

18:38.792 --> 18:41.792
I JUST--I LOVE YOU.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.542
I LOVE YOU.

18:51.166 --> 18:54.500
WERE YOU JUST SAYING
I LOVE YOU TO YOUR GENITALS?

18:54.542 --> 18:55.750
N-NO.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.041
(door opens)

19:01.083 --> 19:02.750
(door closes)

19:16.458 --> 19:17.959
HEY.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.792
THERE'S--

19:19.834 --> 19:22.583
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU,
TELL YOU SOMETHING

19:22.625 --> 19:24.792
THAT I, UH...

19:24.834 --> 19:27.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:27.041 --> 19:29.583
(chuckles) UH, THAT--
THAT'S CAMI'S URINE SAMPLE.

19:29.625 --> 19:32.083
YOU'RE SPYING ON CAMI'S PEE?
NO.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.083
UH...

19:34.125 --> 19:35.583
THIS--THIS, UM,

19:35.625 --> 19:37.583
THIS CAMI THING IS EATING
AT ME, ALL RIGHT?

19:37.625 --> 19:39.709
IT'S REALLY
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.792
SO IF I WERE A PATIENT,
WHAT WOULD I TELL MYSELF?

19:41.834 --> 19:43.333
HOPEFULLY
THAT TALKING TO YOURSELF

19:43.375 --> 19:45.375
LIKE YOU'RE TWO PEOPLE
IS A SIGN OF INSANITY.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.875
NO, I WOULD TELL MY PATIENT
THAT THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT

19:48.917 --> 19:51.041
A WAY TO MOVE ON,
TO GET SOME INFORMATION

19:51.083 --> 19:53.208
SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE ON.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.417
AND THAT RELATES TO CAMI'S
BODILY FLUIDS HOW?

19:55.458 --> 19:57.750
WHAT IF CAMI'S PREGNANT?

19:57.792 --> 20:00.041
I MEAN, IF I KNOW
THAT CAMI IS PREGNANT,

20:00.083 --> 20:02.667
THAT WOULD BE A BIG STEP
IN REALLY SOLIDIFYING

20:02.709 --> 20:05.041
THAT IT'S OVER
BETWEEN ME AND ALLAN.

20:05.083 --> 20:08.750
OKAY, DO NOT STEAL
THAT URINE.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.458
RIGHT. OKAY.
YEAH.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.208
ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

20:14.250 --> 20:17.583
IT'S, UH, IT WOULD
BE BETTER LATER.
NO, NO, JUST TELL ME NOW.

20:17.625 --> 20:20.458
I NEED TO FOCUS ON
SOMETHING OTHER THAN CAMI.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
I MADE THIS PACT,

20:22.542 --> 20:24.041
AND THERE ARE SOME FEELINGS

20:24.083 --> 20:26.500
THAT, UH, UH...

20:26.542 --> 20:28.208
VIOLET!

20:28.250 --> 20:30.250
STEP AWAY FROM THE PEE PEE.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.917
RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.834
I AM REMOVING MYSELF
FROM THE SITUATION.

20:38.917 --> 20:40.917
THAT WENT PERFECTLY.

20:40.959 --> 20:42.917
(Violet)
FROM WHAT I COULD SEE,

20:42.959 --> 20:44.917
REBECCA DOESN'T TOTALLY FIT
THE MUNCHAUSEN PROFILE.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.917
DO YOU THINK
I'M PERSONALIZING THIS CASE?

20:46.959 --> 20:50.875
LIKE MAYBE I NEED TO BELIEVE
IN THE HAPPY MIRACLE BABY?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.875
WELL, INSTINCT'S A BITCH,
RIGHT?

20:52.917 --> 20:57.041
YOU ONLY KNOW IF YOU CAN
TRUST IT AFTER THE FACT.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.250
OKAY, LOOK...

20:59.291 --> 21:01.417
YOU AND I DON'T KNOW
EACH OTHER THAT WELL.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.959
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS, BUT...

21:04.000 --> 21:06.792
YOU COULD... SHARE.

21:06.834 --> 21:09.542
I GUESS.

21:09.583 --> 21:12.041
NO. N-NO, NO, NO.
I-I DON'T WANNA--

21:12.083 --> 21:15.917
YES, YES. LET'S... SHARE.

21:15.959 --> 21:18.041
YEAH?

21:18.083 --> 21:20.333
OH, IT'S JUST...

21:22.917 --> 21:25.041
I HAVE FERTILITY ISSUES.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.041
AND NAOMI--

21:27.083 --> 21:28.667
I DON'T KNOW.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.458
AND I'M ALL CRANKY
ABOUT IT,

21:30.500 --> 21:33.542
AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE,
A RIGHT.

21:33.583 --> 21:38.000
I'M RIGHT... AND ALL.
I KNOW. YOU KNOW?

21:39.583 --> 21:41.542
UH, THE SHARING, IT'S...

21:41.583 --> 21:45.041
IT'S--IT'S NOT SO GOOD.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.583
NO.
(sighs)

21:46.625 --> 21:48.375
BUT, HEY, I DON'T EVEN
WANT KIDS.

21:48.417 --> 21:50.375
BUT THE IDEA OF MY EX's
NEW WIFE HAVING ONE...

21:50.417 --> 21:52.041
(whispers)
IT'S MAKING ME NUTS.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.917
NO, IT'S BETTER TO KNOW,
JUST GET THROUGH IT.

21:53.959 --> 21:55.667
(normal voice) WELL,
SHE'S SEEING NAOMI.

21:55.709 --> 21:58.041
NAOMI WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT NAOMI.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.583
DON'T LET HER TELL YOU
WHAT YOU CAN

22:00.625 --> 22:02.208
AND CANNOT KNOW.

22:02.250 --> 22:06.208
IN FACT...
GO LOOK AT THE FILE YOURSELF.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.000
YEAH.

22:08.041 --> 22:12.041
I MEAN, YOU JUST WAIT UNTIL
DELL IS AWAY FROM HIS DOMAIN,

22:12.083 --> 22:14.542
AND THEN YOU GO FOR IT.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.959
YOU GO GET YOUR ANSWERS.

22:19.458 --> 22:22.417
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT
OF A CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT?

22:22.458 --> 22:24.041
YEAH.

22:24.083 --> 22:26.625
I LIKE YOU.

22:30.208 --> 22:32.041
MICHAEL, WHAT HAPPENED?

22:32.083 --> 22:34.500
WHY DID YOU TELL ME
TO DO THAT?

22:34.542 --> 22:36.083
DO WHAT?

22:36.125 --> 22:39.041
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID ANYTHING. I KNEW IT.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.041
MICHAEL,
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

22:41.083 --> 22:43.125
BRIAN.
OKAY, WHO'S BRIAN?

22:43.166 --> 22:46.375
HE'S THE ONE I ASKED OUT...

22:46.417 --> 22:49.041
THE ONE I LOVE.

22:53.417 --> 22:55.041
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING 10
AND ALREADY KNOWING WHO YOU ARE?

22:55.083 --> 22:57.417
SOME KIDS KNOW.
THEY JUST KNOW.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.959
THIS POOR GUY, HE--HE CAME OUT,
AND HE GOT HIS HEART BROKEN

23:00.000 --> 23:03.041
AND HIS ASS KICKED
ALL IN ONE DAY.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.667
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.667
YOU--YOU SHOULD DO
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

23:06.709 --> 23:09.792
YOU GOTTA LISTEN, STAY ON TOP
OF THE SITUATION.

23:09.834 --> 23:11.041
KIDS LIKE MICHAEL

23:11.083 --> 23:13.458
ARE AT A HIGH RISK
FOR SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.000
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S USUALLY
WHEN THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.250
YOU DON'T THINK
HE MIGHT HURT HIMSELF NOW?
IT HAPPENS.

23:18.291 --> 23:21.709
OKAY. OKAY.

23:21.750 --> 23:24.291
I'LL TALK TO HIS PARENTS.
THANKS.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.917
HELLO, CLOSURE.

23:36.959 --> 23:38.917
I'M HAVING THEM RUN
AN ECHO

23:38.959 --> 23:40.166
TO CHECK
FOR HEART ABNORMALITIES

23:40.208 --> 23:42.208
AND TESTS TO RULE OUT
ARTERY OBSTRUCTIONS

23:42.250 --> 23:43.959
AND SEIZURE ACTIVITIES.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.208
ALL THESE TESTS...

23:45.250 --> 23:47.208
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS
JUST FOR ME, ARE YOU?

23:47.250 --> 23:49.208
I KNOW I'M PUSHING
FOR AN ANSWER, BUT--

23:49.250 --> 23:52.041
AS MUCH AS I ADORE YOU,
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

23:52.083 --> 23:55.041
I'M DOING IT FOR STAN,
THE GUY THAT CALLED ME A WACKO.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.041
PETE.
OH, UM, SYLVIE,
THIS IS ADDISON.

23:57.083 --> 23:58.667
SHE'S OUR G.Y.N.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.041
YOU'RE NEW.

24:00.083 --> 24:01.667
HOW DO YOU?

24:01.709 --> 24:03.667
UH, PETE, UH,
IF YOU GET A MOMENT LATER,

24:03.709 --> 24:06.667
I COULD USE YOU FOR, UM,
A CONSULT

24:06.709 --> 24:09.041
ON MY PATIENT'S
NUTRITIONAL STATUS.

24:09.083 --> 24:12.500
AT WHICH TIME, I'D ALSO LIKE
AN RSVP TO MY PARTY.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.834
OKAY.

24:14.875 --> 24:18.000
OR YOU COULD RSVP NOW.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.125
I'LL WAIT.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.125
OR I COULD UNINVITE YOU.

24:24.166 --> 24:26.083
(chuckles)

24:33.125 --> 24:34.542
YOU LIKE THAT ONE.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.125
DON'T DO THAT.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.041
DON'T MOTHER ME.

24:38.083 --> 24:40.625
SHE REMINDS ME A LITTLE
OF YOUR ANNA.

24:42.083 --> 24:44.709
MY WIFE
WAS NOTHING LIKE ADDISON.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.166
WELL,
THERE ARE SIMILARITIES,

24:47.208 --> 24:49.959
BUT ADDISON IS...
TOUGHER.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.333
ADDISON DOESN'T NEED...

24:52.375 --> 24:54.291
SHE--SHE DOESN'T NEED.

24:54.333 --> 24:57.041
WHICH MAKES HER
SEEM PERFECT FOR YOU.

24:57.083 --> 24:59.000
CAN WE FOCUS ON STAN?

25:03.625 --> 25:05.333
THIS IS CAMI DAVIS' FILE.

25:05.375 --> 25:06.834
JUST...

25:06.875 --> 25:08.834
I GOTTA KNOW. TELL ME.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.083
NO. I TOLD YOU I WOULDN'T.
I KNOW, BUT NOW
I'M TELLING YOU TO TELL ME.

25:12.125 --> 25:15.041
NO. I SWORE I WOULDN'T.
WELL, JUST GIVE ME THE FILE,

25:15.083 --> 25:17.083
AND THEN YOU WON'T
HAVE TO TELL ME ANYTHING.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.542
DON'T MAKE ME HURT YOU.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.875
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT
A LITTLE.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.625
I AM FREAKING OUT
A LITTLE.

25:36.667 --> 25:38.792
MICHAEL'S MISSING?

25:38.834 --> 25:40.583
WE GOT HOME,
AND HE WENT TO LIE DOWN.

25:40.625 --> 25:43.875
BUT WHEN I CHECKED ON HIM,
HE WAS GONE.
WE'VE BEEN ALL OVER.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.250
I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WENT
TO SETTLE THE SCORE

25:46.291 --> 25:49.041
WITH THOSE KIDS WHO HIT HIM.
I'VE LEFT HIM
A DOZEN MESSAGES.

25:49.083 --> 25:52.208
I TEXTED HIM.
HE USUALLY CALLS RIGHT BACK.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.417
DO WE CALL THE POLICE?
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME
CHECK THE SCHOOL AGAIN FIRST.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.625
MAYBE I JUST MISSED HIM.
I'LL CHECK THE SKATE PARK.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.625
ARE YOU SURE?
YOU'VE GOT PATIENTS.

25:59.667 --> 26:02.083
LET'S...
LET'S JUST FIND MICHAEL.

26:04.834 --> 26:06.500
COME HERE.
I FELT THE BABY MOVING.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.709
YOU HAVE TO FEEL THIS.

26:13.208 --> 26:16.041
THIS IS MRS. HOBART,
REBECCA'S MOTHER.

26:16.083 --> 26:19.250
THE AMBULANCE
IS WAITING DOWNSTAIRS.
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

26:19.291 --> 26:22.166
MRS. HOBART,
SHE'S HAD A ROUGH DAY.

26:22.208 --> 26:23.625
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.792
YOU WANT TO HEAR
HOW REBECCA OPERATES?

26:25.834 --> 26:27.875
SHUT UP, MOM!
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST
TAKE THIS SLOW.

26:27.917 --> 26:32.083
SHE STARVES. OR SHE EATS GOD
KNOWS WHAT TO GET SICK.

26:32.125 --> 26:35.250
THEN SHE DUPES ANOTHER HOSPITAL
INTO BELIEVING HER

26:35.291 --> 26:37.667
UNTIL THEY FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.
GET HER OUT OF HERE!

26:37.709 --> 26:42.250
THAT'S ENOUGH.
OKAY, REMEMBER OUR BREATHING?

26:42.291 --> 26:44.125
GOOD.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.375
GOOD.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.041
WHAT?

26:53.083 --> 26:55.000
WH-WHAT IS IT?

27:02.083 --> 27:05.667
THESE LABS SHOW US
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN IN DAYS.

27:05.709 --> 27:09.333
SHE LIED. SHE HAS BEEN
MAKING HERSELF SICK.

27:09.375 --> 27:11.709
WHAT A SHOCK.
NO, NO. I DID EAT.

27:11.750 --> 27:14.709
(Rebecca whimpers)

27:14.750 --> 27:18.542
I'LL MAKE SURE
HER CONTRACTIONS ARE GONE,

27:18.583 --> 27:21.375
THEN SHE'S YOURS.

27:21.417 --> 27:25.542
I TH--
I THOUGHT YOU BELIEVED ME.

27:25.583 --> 27:28.083
I DID.

27:28.125 --> 27:31.375
OH, GOD.

27:31.417 --> 27:35.250
(crying)

27:40.250 --> 27:42.041
OKAY, I HAVE STAN'S LABS.

27:42.083 --> 27:43.375
M.R.I. LOOKS GOOD.

27:43.417 --> 27:46.333
THE BLOOD LEVELS ARE GOOD.

27:46.375 --> 27:49.041
ALL THE TESTS
CHECK OUT OKAY.

27:49.083 --> 27:50.917
THANK GOD.

27:50.959 --> 27:52.417
RIGHT?

27:52.458 --> 27:54.041
SYLVIE, YOU DON'T KNOW--

27:54.083 --> 27:57.792
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

27:57.834 --> 28:00.917
THEN FIND ME
ANOTHER ANSWER.

28:16.041 --> 28:20.458
SO MUCH
FOR BEING INSPIRED, HUH?

28:28.083 --> 28:30.250
OH, CRAP. ADDISON, WAIT.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.583
WAIT UP.

28:33.625 --> 28:37.458
UH, WE NEED A LITTLE BIT
MORE TIME WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
SAM.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.041
DR. BENNETT, THIS IS--

28:39.083 --> 28:41.041
I KNOW THAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL,

28:41.083 --> 28:43.458
AND MAYBE YOUR DAUGHTER
IS A MASTER MANIPULATOR.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.417
BUT, UH, SHE RISKED A LOT
TO COME HERE

28:46.458 --> 28:50.500
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT
WE WERE DIFFERENT...

28:50.542 --> 28:53.041
AND BETTER.

28:53.083 --> 28:56.458
AND I BELIEVE WE ARE.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.458
WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.792
WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME.
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK--

29:01.834 --> 29:05.375
SAM, PLEASE DON'T INDULGE
THIS--
(Sam) WE JUST WANT
TO HELP YOUR DAUGHTER.

29:05.417 --> 29:07.125
THAT'S ALL WE ASK.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.041
OKAY.

29:15.083 --> 29:17.041
ONE HOUR.

29:17.083 --> 29:19.125
YOU GET ONE MORE HOUR.

29:25.583 --> 29:28.583
(children speaking indistinctly)

29:30.375 --> 29:31.333
BRIAN.

29:31.375 --> 29:32.834
YEAH, WHAT?

29:32.875 --> 29:34.959
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE MICHAEL IS?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.333
HEY, HEY, WHOA.

29:37.375 --> 29:40.041
WHERE'S MICHAEL?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S A FREAK.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.333
HE'S YOUR FRIEND.
NO, HE'S NOT.

29:42.375 --> 29:44.959
I THOUGHT HE WAS
UNTIL HE SAID ALL THAT STUFF.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.542
SO YOU HIT HIM JUST 'CAUSE
HE SAID SOMETHING?
HE ASKED ME OUT ON A DATE.

29:47.583 --> 29:50.458
AND I'LL BET HE WISHES
HE DIDN'T, BUT HE DID.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.458
SO HE'S GONNA HAVE TO
LIVE WITH THAT. CAN YOU?

29:52.500 --> 29:55.750
YOU CAN'T JUST GO AROUND SAYING
STUFF LIKE THAT, NOT HERE.

29:55.792 --> 29:58.542
BRIAN, MICHAEL'S MISSING.
I NEED TO FIND HIM.
HE'S WHAT?

29:58.583 --> 30:01.875
HE'S MISSING. DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE COULD BE?
NO.

30:01.917 --> 30:03.959
HEY, BRIAN, COME ON.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.125
THERE'S A PARKING LOT
WHERE WE HANG AT.

30:06.166 --> 30:08.125
THERE'S A COOL RAMP
THAT WE SKATE ON.

30:08.166 --> 30:10.375
MAYBE HE'D GO THERE.

30:10.417 --> 30:13.458
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HIT HIM SO HARD.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.875
TELL HIM I'M SORRY. OKAY?
THANKS.

30:16.917 --> 30:18.875
SAM, I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

30:18.917 --> 30:21.041
BUT WHAT CAN WE
POSSIBLY FIND IN AN HOUR?

30:21.083 --> 30:23.792
WHY DID YOU MAKE PROMISES
TO THIS WOMAN

30:23.834 --> 30:27.041
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T KEEP?
BECAUSE MAYBE WE CAN. OKAY?

30:27.083 --> 30:29.333
NOW IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
WE NEED TO COVER

30:29.375 --> 30:33.083
BEFORE WE CAN GET
OUR HEADS IN THE GAME?
I-I HAVE A NEED.

30:33.125 --> 30:36.000
I NEED TO KNOW
WHY CAMI IS HERE.

30:36.041 --> 30:39.667
LOOK, YOU MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL Y--
SPILL.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.625
(sighs)

30:42.667 --> 30:45.125
IT'S A BLADDER INFECTION...

30:45.166 --> 30:47.000
FROM HAVING TOO MUCH SEX.

30:49.083 --> 30:52.041
CAMI AND ALLAN HAVE BEEN
HAVING A LOT OF SEX.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.750
OH, GOOD.
IT'S NOT CANCER.

30:54.792 --> 30:57.458
I WAS JUST AFRAID
IT MIGHT BE CANCER.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.250
WELL, IT ISN'T.
GOOD. DONE.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.667
NOW REBECCA.

31:07.625 --> 31:11.333
(pants) MICHAEL.

31:11.375 --> 31:15.000
(wheezing)

31:17.083 --> 31:19.750
I WAS GONNA RUN AWAY...

31:19.792 --> 31:21.750
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

31:21.792 --> 31:24.000
PLUS, RUNNING AWAY IS LAME.

31:25.667 --> 31:28.041
SO THEN I THOUGHT
I'D JUST JUMP.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.583
MICHAEL...

31:29.625 --> 31:32.500
AND JUMPING'S EVEN LAMER
THAN RUNNING AWAY.

31:32.542 --> 31:36.041
I TALKED TO BRIAN.

31:36.083 --> 31:38.083
HE FEELS PRETTY BAD.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.208
YEAH, WELL...

31:40.250 --> 31:42.041
HE DOESN'T LOVE ME BACK.

31:42.083 --> 31:44.000
NO.

31:54.834 --> 31:56.792
LOOK, SOME KIDS
ARE COOL WITH IT.

31:56.834 --> 32:00.750
YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH THEM.

32:00.792 --> 32:03.000
I WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH BRIAN.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.875
I WISH I WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

32:08.917 --> 32:11.250
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:11.291 --> 32:13.750
I WISH I WAS YOU.

32:13.792 --> 32:15.041
(scoffs)

32:15.083 --> 32:17.083
YOU'RE OLD.

32:17.125 --> 32:19.834
YEAH, I AM OLD.
I AM ELDERLY.

32:19.875 --> 32:21.333
BUT YOU'RE YOUNG.

32:21.375 --> 32:23.333
YOU WILL HAVE
A LOT OF CHANCES

32:23.375 --> 32:24.834
TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN

32:24.875 --> 32:27.458
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S REALLY
INTO YOU BIG-TIME.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.083
ME, BEING SO OLD AN ALL,
RIGHT, I'M DONE.

32:30.125 --> 32:33.417
THIS ONE, THIS GIRL,
THIS LOVE,

32:33.458 --> 32:35.667
THAT'S PROBABLY IT FOR ME.

32:35.709 --> 32:38.709
AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO TELL HER HOW I FELT.

32:38.750 --> 32:42.000
I LOOKED AT HER,
AND I JUST... I COULDN'T.

32:44.083 --> 32:46.792
YOU TOLD BRIAN.

32:46.834 --> 32:51.000
AND--AND YOU'RE A LOT BRAVER
THAN I AM.

32:51.041 --> 32:53.709
DAMN.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.792
YOU LITTLE PUNK.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.083
I, UH, I DON'T WANT
TO GO HOME YET.

33:02.125 --> 33:04.667
WE CAN HANG OUT
FOR A WHILE.

33:04.709 --> 33:08.625
AND THEN WE NEED TO TELL
YOUR FOLKS YOU'RE OKAY.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.625
I DON'T KNOW. (sighs)

33:15.667 --> 33:19.333
I DON'T...
NOTHING'S JUMPING OUT AT ME.

33:19.375 --> 33:21.792
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BELIEVED. WHY?

33:21.834 --> 33:24.834
BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS
TELLING THE TRUTH.

33:28.083 --> 33:31.417
IGNORE THE FILES,
IGNORE ALL THE PRECONCEPTIONS,

33:31.458 --> 33:33.792
AND LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS

33:33.834 --> 33:36.583
AS IF EVERYTHING REBECCA
HAS TOLD US IS THE TRUTH.

33:36.625 --> 33:39.333
WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT
THE HOSPITAL MISSED SOMETHING

33:39.375 --> 33:41.041
RIGHT FROM THE START.

33:41.083 --> 33:44.041
AND THEN SHE'S SADDLED
WITH A PSYCH DIAGNOSIS.

33:44.083 --> 33:47.041
SO THE DOCTORS WOULD ASSUME
THAT HER WORSENING SYMPTOMS

33:47.083 --> 33:50.792
ARE JUST SIGNS OF INCREASINGLY
DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.
BUT THAT COULD ALSO INDICATE

33:50.834 --> 33:53.542
A WORSENING OF HER
REAL PHYSICAL CONDITION.

33:53.583 --> 33:56.458
SO THEN WHAT'S THE MISSING
ILLNESS THAT STARTED IT ALL?

33:56.500 --> 33:58.792
WELL, ONE THAT--THAT MAKES HER
FEEL STOMACH SPASMS AND PAIN

33:58.834 --> 34:01.750
AFTER SHE EATS.
ASSOCIATED WITH OCCASIONAL
JOINT PAINS AND FEVERS...

34:01.792 --> 34:04.208
AND COMES AND GOES
IN CYCLES.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.041
DID THEY EVER GET
A G.I. CAMERA STUDY?

34:06.083 --> 34:09.041
I DIDN'T SEE IT
IN HER RECORDS.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.834
HOW WOULD THAT HELP?
THE CAMERA COULD GET TO PLACES
IN REBECCA'S BODY

34:11.875 --> 34:14.458
THAT PREVIOUS WORKUPS
COULDN'T HAVE SEEN.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.709
IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW
PROCEDURE.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.792
AND IF SHE HAD AN OCCULT FORM
OF AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE...

34:19.834 --> 34:23.041
AFFECTING DEEP SECTIONS
OF THE INTESTINE...
IT WOULD FLARE UP
DURING TIMES OF STRESS,

34:23.083 --> 34:25.583
LIKE DURING PREGNANCY.
WHICH MEANS SHE WOULDN'T
ABSORB NUTRIENTS PROPERLY.

34:25.625 --> 34:27.500
AND EXPLAINS WHY SHE SAYS
SHE'S EATING,

34:27.542 --> 34:29.709
BUT THE LABS SAY SHE'S NOT.
SO THEY COULD'VE MISSED IT?

34:29.750 --> 34:33.041
THEY DEFINITELY
COULD'VE MISSED IT.
ALL RIGHT.

34:33.083 --> 34:35.709
LOOK, I WAS PLAYING TUG-OF-WAR
WITH THE WHEELCHAIR, OKAY?

34:35.750 --> 34:37.125
BUT CHARLOTTE IS STRONGER
THAN SHE LOOKS.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.792
THEY TOOK HER BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL?
REBECCA'S GONE?

34:39.834 --> 34:41.041
SHE'S GONE.

34:41.083 --> 34:43.041
(sighs)

34:46.125 --> 34:48.083
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS GIRL'S MOTHER WILL SAY

34:48.125 --> 34:51.041
IF SHE FINDS OUT I RAN ANOTHER
TEST WITHOUT HER CONSENT?

34:51.083 --> 34:54.041
WHAT WILL SHE SAY IF THE TEST
COULD SAVE REBECCA'S LIFE,

34:54.083 --> 34:55.208
HERS AND THE BABY'S?

34:55.250 --> 34:57.500
Y'ALL REALLY WANT ME
TO GET FIRED, DON'T YOU?

34:57.542 --> 35:00.500
IF YOU NEED A WIN TO GET
THE HOSPITAL OFF YOUR BACK

35:00.542 --> 35:03.041
FOR REBECCA WALKING,
TAKE FULL CREDIT FOR THE FIX.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.125
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CREDIT.

35:05.166 --> 35:07.917
OKAY, I DO CARE
ABOUT THE CREDIT.

35:07.959 --> 35:11.417
BUT I CARE ABOUT HELPING
THIS GIRL MORE.

35:11.458 --> 35:14.041
WE'LL SET UP
FOR THE CAMERA STUDY.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.041
ALL RIGHT.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.333
SOMETHING SYLVIE SAID
HAS ME WONDERING.

35:21.375 --> 35:23.959
I SPOKE TO YOU
IN CONFIDENCE.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.709
SYLVIE, I THINK I MIGHT KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH STAN.
YOU DO?

35:26.750 --> 35:29.041
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN HAVING
A LOT OF SEX?

35:29.083 --> 35:30.917
A GENTLEMAN DOESN'T DISCUSS--
YES.

35:30.959 --> 35:33.041

I'M NOT GOING TO
STAND HERE

35:33.083 --> 35:35.917

FROM THIS PERVERT.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.291
MOSTLY ONE POSITION.

35:38.333 --> 35:40.500

I'M ON TOP.

MM-HMM.

36:09.458 --> 36:12.166
ALL THAT REPETITIVE MOTION

36:12.208 --> 36:14.166
FORMED A TRIGGER POINT
IN THE MUSCLE,

36:14.208 --> 36:15.959
'CAUSING A PAINLESS MIGRAINE.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.041

36:23.166 --> 36:26.125

MUSCLE THERAPY SHOULD DO IT.

36:26.166 --> 36:28.125

36:28.166 --> 36:30.625
