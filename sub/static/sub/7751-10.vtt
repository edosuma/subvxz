<i>Previously on
"Devious Maids"...</i>

00:02.193 --> 00:04.998
This place has more doors
than a whorehouse.

00:05.033 --> 00:06.525
Hello, mother.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.703
Everyone called her
the butterball express.

00:09.738 --> 00:11.589
Not everyone, mother.
Just you.

00:11.623 --> 00:14.125
I'm going to the Four Seasons
for a few weeks.

00:14.159 --> 00:15.960
Who's gonna take care
of your mother?

00:15.994 --> 00:17.628
Zoila!

00:17.662 --> 00:19.797
I hope in time,
you'll find a way to forgive me.

00:19.831 --> 00:22.800
I also plan on moving to Europe
and taking Tucker with me.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.935
I will not allow that.
I will fight you in court.

00:24.970 --> 00:26.270
And you'll lose.

00:26.304 --> 00:29.540
You're the scum shacking up
with the maid, remember?

00:33.812 --> 00:36.013
Before I go
into surgery tomorrow,

00:36.048 --> 00:37.548
I need you to do something.

00:37.582 --> 00:40.418
- Anything you want.
- Marry me.

00:40.452 --> 00:43.220
You may kiss the bride.

00:43.255 --> 00:44.822
You got some sort of letter.

00:46.258 --> 00:48.926
- Uncle Ken wants a divorce.
- Because of that letter?

00:48.960 --> 00:51.829
Now that he knows
she was unfaithful, it's over.

00:54.566 --> 00:57.301
I'm so sorry.

00:57.335 --> 00:58.469
I date men.

00:58.503 --> 01:01.305
All I see when I look at you
is a confused little boy.

01:01.339 --> 01:03.941
How does us robbing your Uncle
get you this girl?

01:03.975 --> 01:05.776
I'm gonna save her life.

01:06.011 --> 01:08.392
Everyone on your knees!

01:08.580 --> 01:09.680
Listen up, morons!

01:09.714 --> 01:12.283
If anyone tries anything,
we will shoot her!

01:19.024 --> 01:20.858
We've got to get out of here!
Stay down!

01:22.360 --> 01:23.160
Ethan?

01:23.195 --> 01:25.563
What happened to you?!

01:25.597 --> 01:26.764
Ethan!

All right.

01:48.453 --> 01:50.321
Hey. Ethan. Hey.

01:50.355 --> 01:51.755
We have to go.

02:01.433 --> 02:02.533
Ethan, I am begging.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.702
Please let me take you
to the hospital.

02:04.736 --> 02:06.804
- No way.
- But there's so much blood!

02:06.838 --> 02:08.739
I'll be fine.
Where are we?

02:08.773 --> 02:10.741
My mom's house.

02:10.775 --> 02:13.944
Don't worry.
She's at the Delatours'.

02:13.979 --> 02:16.981
So, you've got to tell me,

02:17.015 --> 02:18.649
how did this happen?

02:18.683 --> 02:20.684
I...
I was in a fight.

02:20.719 --> 02:21.952
What?

02:21.987 --> 02:24.488
We were at the bar drinking,
and some guy got in my face.

02:24.523 --> 02:25.656
And he stabbed you?

02:25.690 --> 02:27.258
And then I cracked a bottle
over his head.

02:27.292 --> 02:29.093
The cops won't care
who started it, so...

02:29.127 --> 02:31.428
Just try and stop the bleeding.

02:32.864 --> 02:34.131
What was that?

02:34.166 --> 02:37.001
You passed out on our way
over here, so I called someone.

02:37.035 --> 02:38.302
You did what?

02:38.336 --> 02:39.570
He'll be able help you.

02:39.604 --> 02:40.504
B-but, Valentina, I...

02:40.539 --> 02:42.873
I'm not gonna let you die.

02:42.908 --> 02:44.408
And he promised
he wouldn't tell anyone.

02:44.442 --> 02:45.976
Wait, so who exactly
did you call?

03:10.502 --> 03:12.102
Would it surprise you
to know that

03:12.137 --> 03:15.973
that painting cost $200,000?

03:18.810 --> 03:19.877
Yes.

03:19.911 --> 03:22.107
My Uncle never helped my mom.

03:23.281 --> 03:24.848
Not when she lost her job,

03:24.883 --> 03:27.785
not when she struggled
to put me through school.

03:27.819 --> 03:32.122
He was too busy
buying fine art.

03:34.559 --> 03:36.293
I'm going to sell it.

03:36.328 --> 03:38.362
Are you allowed to do that?

03:38.396 --> 03:40.864
Sure.

03:40.899 --> 03:43.267
I have my Uncle Ken's
power of attorney.

03:43.301 --> 03:46.070
I'm supposed to make decisions
about this house

03:46.104 --> 03:47.605
and everything in it.

03:48.673 --> 03:52.643
I have to get Mr. Kenneth
ready for bed.

03:52.677 --> 03:55.379
When you're done,
why don't you come to my room?

03:55.413 --> 03:56.747
I can't.

03:56.781 --> 03:58.415
Why not? We have the house
to ourselves now.

03:58.450 --> 04:00.251
But...

04:00.285 --> 04:01.819
My son might see us.

04:01.853 --> 04:05.656
- We can lock the door.
- It wouldn't feel right.

04:05.690 --> 04:08.459
Some other time.
When Miguel isn't here.

04:08.493 --> 04:10.961
Miguel is always here.

04:12.631 --> 04:14.265
That is true.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.274
What do you think?

04:23.308 --> 04:27.111
It should stop the bleeding.
For now.

04:27.145 --> 04:28.479
Does it hurt?

04:28.513 --> 04:29.880
Not that bad.

04:30.548 --> 04:31.749
Ow!

04:31.783 --> 04:33.651
Oops.

04:33.685 --> 04:35.419
Geez, you miss the class
on stitches?

04:35.453 --> 04:37.721
Oh, I think
what you meant to say was,

04:37.756 --> 04:39.890
"thank you
for saving my life."

04:41.793 --> 04:43.327
Yeah, okay.

04:43.361 --> 04:44.962
Thanks for helping out.

04:44.996 --> 04:49.266
And just so we're clear,
I didn't do it for you.

04:51.236 --> 04:53.671
Ethan, you should go lay down.

04:53.705 --> 04:55.172
My room's at the end
of the hall.

05:04.816 --> 05:06.684
Relax.

05:06.718 --> 05:10.120
I won't make a move on her while
I'm covered with your blood.

05:15.694 --> 05:18.128
You've got to check his temperature
every 20 minutes, all right?

05:18.163 --> 05:20.464
If he starts to get a fever,

05:20.498 --> 05:22.232
you've got to get him
to the hospital. Understand?

05:22.267 --> 05:24.429
- I do.
- All right.

05:26.971 --> 05:27.905
Remi.

05:27.939 --> 05:31.675
Thank you for tonight.
I will never forget it.

05:31.710 --> 05:34.778
That story Ethan told you
about a knife fight?

05:34.813 --> 05:35.946
I think he's lying.

05:37.315 --> 05:38.515
I know.

05:48.593 --> 05:50.828
Velma, enough with the bell.

05:50.829 --> 05:53.063
- I'm not a dog.
- I know.

05:53.098 --> 05:55.699
- A dog would've come quicker.
- Ugh!

05:55.734 --> 05:58.502
Oh, God!
You're topless.

05:58.536 --> 06:00.371
I'm sunning myself.

06:00.405 --> 06:02.539
Haven't you ever seen boobs
before?

06:02.574 --> 06:04.541
Not down there.

06:04.576 --> 06:06.944
Any chance you could cover up
while we're talking?

06:06.978 --> 06:09.580
Oh, fine.

06:09.614 --> 06:11.782
I need a bloody Mary.

06:11.816 --> 06:13.350
How about "please"?

06:13.385 --> 06:15.886
How about
"I'm the boss, so hurry up"?

06:15.920 --> 06:18.422
You're not my boss.
I work for Genevieve,

06:18.456 --> 06:20.391
and when she gets back
from her business trip,

06:20.425 --> 06:22.393
I will tell her
how you've been treating me.

06:22.427 --> 06:24.628
My daughter's not on
any business trip,

06:24.662 --> 06:25.863
and you know it.

06:25.897 --> 06:28.899
She's hiding out
in some fancy spa

06:28.933 --> 06:31.301
where the crappers
are made of gold.

06:31.336 --> 06:33.337
Okay, she's at a spa resting.

06:33.371 --> 06:35.773
You know, because of her...
Health problems.

06:35.807 --> 06:37.107
No.

06:37.142 --> 06:40.611
She thinks if she avoids me
long enough, I'll leave.

06:40.645 --> 06:43.213
Well, you can tell her
I'm not going anywhere.

06:43.248 --> 06:45.449
Now get me a bloody Mary.

06:45.483 --> 06:46.950
Get it yourself.

06:49.421 --> 06:52.122
Oh, God, that's just not fair.

06:56.828 --> 06:59.797
<i>This would have been the third
home invasion in recent months,</i>

06:59.831 --> 07:01.198
<i>but this time,</i>

07:01.232 --> 07:04.234
<i>the robbers were thwarted
by the heroic actions</i>

07:04.269 --> 07:06.270
<i>of quick-thinking housekeeper
Carmen Luna.</i>

07:06.304 --> 07:08.439
<i>Tell us how you handled
that gang of thieves.</i>

07:08.473 --> 07:10.407
<i>I stabbed one
with a cake knife.</i>

07:10.442 --> 07:12.109
<i>That's a bold move
on your part.</i>

07:12.143 --> 07:13.944
<i>Yeah. I would have stabbed
them all,</i>

07:13.978 --> 07:15.612
<i>but they ran away
like scared little bunnies.</i>

07:15.647 --> 07:18.382
<i>Amazing story, gang.
Back to you in the studio.</i>

07:18.416 --> 07:20.017
You see how my hair
is messed up?

07:20.051 --> 07:22.252
I could've fixed it, but they
wouldn't let me do another take.

07:22.287 --> 07:23.487
It's the news, Carmen.

07:23.521 --> 07:25.355
They're more focused on
the crime than your hair.

07:25.390 --> 07:27.491
My hair is the crime.

07:27.525 --> 07:29.226
You know, let's watch
the interview from Channel 9.

07:29.260 --> 07:30.461
Those people knew
how to light me.

07:31.629 --> 07:32.963
Oh, God.

07:32.997 --> 07:36.366
- Who is it?
- That's my divorce lawyer.

07:36.401 --> 07:38.869
We're waiting for the judge
to make a ruling on custody.

07:38.903 --> 07:39.837
This could be it.

07:41.005 --> 07:42.372
Oh, it just has to be
good news.

07:42.407 --> 07:44.374
If Peri takes Tucker to Europe,
I won't see him for months.

07:44.409 --> 07:47.077
You will never know
unless you answer the phone.

07:51.749 --> 07:54.651
Hey, Jeff.

07:54.686 --> 07:56.186
What'd the judge say?

07:59.924 --> 08:02.459
Uh-huh.

08:02.494 --> 08:03.961
Uh...

08:03.995 --> 08:06.196
Yeah, well,
thanks for letting me know.

08:16.708 --> 08:17.541
It's okay.

08:17.575 --> 08:19.643
Don't worry.
I'll clean it.

08:19.677 --> 08:22.546
I got it.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.228
Would you just leave me alone
for a bit?

08:36.782 --> 08:37.982
Nick.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.350
What?

08:39.385 --> 08:42.020
That is the third pain pill
you've taken in the last hour.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.587
So?

08:43.621 --> 08:45.056
So, you have to be careful
with those things.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.859
The doctors told me
to stay ahead of the pain.

08:47.893 --> 08:49.661
You are already
ahead of the pain.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.296
You are about to lap the pain.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.865
I'd argue with you,
but I'm too happy.

08:55.067 --> 08:58.236
Okay, well,
before you drift off to sleep,

08:58.270 --> 08:59.938
I have some good news.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.240
- Opal left.
- She did?

09:02.274 --> 09:03.475
Yep.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.643
So when you get home,
it'll just be the two of us.

09:05.678 --> 09:09.314
We can finally start our lives
as Mr. and Mrs. Deering.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.282
Which one am I?

09:11.317 --> 09:12.383
Okay.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.486
No more pills for you.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.457
I'll be right back.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.460
- Uh, Mrs. Deering?
- Yes.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.761
I'm detective Figueroa.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.697
I think you ow detective Wolf.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.031
We wanted to talk to
your husband

09:27.066 --> 09:28.333
about the car
that ran him down.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.901
Hi. It's very nice
to meet you,

09:29.935 --> 09:31.669
but I'm afraid
now's not a good time.

09:31.704 --> 09:33.771
Well, we could come back,
but so you know,

09:33.806 --> 09:36.241
time is of the essence
with hit-and-runs.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.711
Let me see if he's up for it.
Excuse me.

09:43.782 --> 09:44.816
Honey?

09:44.850 --> 09:47.285
Honey, the police are here.

09:47.319 --> 09:50.054
Do you think you could talk
to them for a few minutes?

09:51.323 --> 09:53.424
They just have a few questions
about the accident.

09:54.493 --> 09:57.795
- They know about that?
- It's not exactly a secret.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.398
You have to believe me.
I...

10:00.432 --> 10:02.367
I never meant for it to happen.

10:02.401 --> 10:05.837
It's okay.
Nobody blames you.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.305
He was right in front of me.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.707
He?

10:09.742 --> 10:12.176
I didn't mean to kill him.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.746
What?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.882
I'm so sorry.

10:17.917 --> 10:18.893
Nick.

10:19.818 --> 10:20.752
Nick.

10:26.892 --> 10:29.661
Like I said,
he's just not up for it.

10:29.695 --> 10:30.695
Thank you.

10:30.729 --> 10:31.963
Yeah, we'll, uh,
come back tomorrow.

10:31.997 --> 10:34.032
Thanks.

10:44.525 --> 10:45.591
Come on.

10:45.626 --> 10:47.293
There you go.

10:49.129 --> 10:51.164
Very good,
Mr. Kenneth.

10:51.198 --> 10:53.533
See?
I knew you could do it.

10:53.567 --> 10:57.136
Therapy is p-p-painful,
but it's working.

10:57.171 --> 10:58.538
It sure is.

10:58.572 --> 11:03.209
Soon, you will be so strong,
you can run your business again.

11:03.243 --> 11:05.344
There's n-n-no rush.

11:05.379 --> 11:07.647
Reggie has things
under control.

11:07.681 --> 11:08.915
Yes.

11:08.949 --> 11:12.685
Mr. Reggie's taking wonderful
care of the house.

11:12.719 --> 11:16.022
He's even talking about
redecorating.

11:16.056 --> 11:17.490
Redecorating?

11:18.559 --> 11:22.161
He says he wants to sell
that painting of yours.

11:22.196 --> 11:24.363
The big one in the living room.

11:24.398 --> 11:25.865
That's an original.

11:25.899 --> 11:27.366
He can't sell that.

11:27.789 --> 11:29.703
He can do whatever he wants.

11:29.804 --> 11:31.872
With your house,
with your bank accounts...

11:31.873 --> 11:33.940
You gave him
power of attorney.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.478
Of course, now that
you're getting stronger,

11:38.512 --> 11:41.314
you can always take it back.

11:49.656 --> 11:51.224
Hey.

11:51.258 --> 11:52.191
How are you doing?

11:52.226 --> 11:53.926
Honestly?
I'm not so good.

11:53.961 --> 11:56.362
But I am finding a way
to ease the pain.

11:56.396 --> 12:00.333
I still can't believe Peri
got custody of your son.

12:00.367 --> 12:01.567
Oh, I knew I was screwed

12:01.602 --> 12:03.669
when the judge asked for
her autograph.

12:03.704 --> 12:05.371
Would you like something
to eat?

12:05.405 --> 12:08.808
I'll take an olive,
floating in a glass of vodka.

12:08.842 --> 12:10.409
Spence,

12:10.444 --> 12:12.745
you can't just sit here
by yourself and drink all night.

12:12.779 --> 12:14.247
Then join me for some Martinis.

12:14.281 --> 12:15.348
What?

12:15.382 --> 12:18.684
You are right.
Drinking alone is pathetic.

12:20.454 --> 12:22.021
You know, it's late.

12:22.055 --> 12:23.823
I have to do the dishes
before going to bed.

12:23.857 --> 12:25.057
I'll tell you what.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.158
I'll make a deal with you.

12:26.193 --> 12:27.460
You have a quick drink with me,

12:27.494 --> 12:29.695
you don't have to do
those dishes.

12:31.365 --> 12:34.066
You know, dishes are easy.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.568
I just stick them
in the machine.

12:35.602 --> 12:39.572
Well, what would you say
to no vacuuming in the morning?

12:39.606 --> 12:41.607
I'd say you getting warmer.

12:41.642 --> 12:44.944
How about if I gave you
the whole day off tomorrow?

12:44.978 --> 12:46.845
I'll get the olives.
You pour.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.902
Party is on!

12:56.876 --> 12:59.644
- Hello.
- Zoila!

12:59.646 --> 13:02.480
You scared me.
I thought you were Sven.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.383
Sven?
Does he work here?

13:05.385 --> 13:08.553
He's a lecherous masseur
who touches me inappropriately.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.588
I'm gonna file a complaint.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.723
Someday.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.525
So, how's my mother?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.928
You're coming home...
Now.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.696
She got to you, didn't she?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.631
That woman is...

13:20.633 --> 13:25.036
- Toxic? Rude? Drunk?
- Yes, yes, and yes.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.805
I'm sorry
she's such a nightmare.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.105
But I can't leave the spa.

13:29.107 --> 13:31.041
I need to stay here
for my kidneys.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.109
You can't cure kidney disease
with facials.

13:33.111 --> 13:35.511
Are you sure?
Have there been studies?

13:35.513 --> 13:37.047
I tried the same lie
with your mother.

13:37.049 --> 13:38.748
But she knows
what you're up to,

13:38.750 --> 13:40.616
and she won't leave that house
until you come home.

13:40.618 --> 13:42.152
No. No!

13:42.154 --> 13:44.554
I can't stand to be
in the same room with her.

13:44.556 --> 13:47.890
You've been running away from
your mother since you were 16.

13:47.892 --> 13:49.859
It's time you come home
and deal with her.

13:49.861 --> 13:52.494
I want to stand up to her.
I do.

13:52.496 --> 13:55.664
But every time I try to tell her
how I feel, she attacks me,

13:55.666 --> 13:57.933
and I'm 5 years old again
and helpless.

13:57.935 --> 13:59.401
Well, she won't attack you
this time,

13:59.403 --> 14:00.869
because I'll be there
to protect you.

14:01.803 --> 14:05.340
- Really?
- Now, please... Come home.

14:07.009 --> 14:08.676
Okay.

14:08.678 --> 14:10.879
Give me five minutes
to get ready.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.349
Hello, Genevieve.

14:14.351 --> 14:16.650
Oh! Sven.

14:18.486 --> 14:20.387
Make that 30 minutes.

14:23.892 --> 14:25.558
Look at me.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.427
I'm in a chair.

14:27.429 --> 14:29.863
Took me a half hour to get here,
but I did it.

14:29.865 --> 14:31.098
Good.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.399
Hey, you don't sound impressed.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.502
Nick...

14:36.504 --> 14:38.771
When you were woozy
on your meds,

14:38.773 --> 14:40.606
do you remember
the conversation we had?

14:40.608 --> 14:41.740
No, why?

14:41.742 --> 14:45.477
You said something kind of...
troubling.

14:45.479 --> 14:48.114
Oh, boy, what'd I say?

14:48.116 --> 14:51.126
You told me
that you killed someone,

14:52.319 --> 14:55.020
and then you said
you were very sorry.

15:00.093 --> 15:02.693
Ooh.
Those are some kind of pills.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.030
Are they?

15:06.032 --> 15:09.500
Obviously. I mean, if they're
getting me to make stuff up.

15:09.502 --> 15:12.737
It's just, when you said it,
you sounded like you were...

15:12.739 --> 15:15.072
Confessing.

15:15.074 --> 15:17.942
You... you cannot possibly hold
me accountable for what I say

15:17.944 --> 15:19.510
when I'm ripped
on pain killers.

15:20.612 --> 15:21.711
Okay.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.513
Come on.

15:23.515 --> 15:24.881
Do you honestly think I would
kill another human being?

15:24.883 --> 15:26.249
I said okay.

15:30.822 --> 15:33.590
You look cold.
Let me get you a blanket.

15:46.242 --> 15:47.373
Hey, Uncle Ken.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.708
Got your message.
What's up?

15:48.710 --> 15:52.812
- I need you to sign this.
- What is it?

15:52.814 --> 15:56.515
My p-power of attorney.

15:56.517 --> 15:57.951
I want it back.

16:00.554 --> 16:02.788
Your financial affairs
are very complex. Okay.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.556
You're not well enough
to handle them.

16:04.558 --> 16:08.460
Maybe not,
but you will sign it anyway.

16:08.462 --> 16:11.130
You seem angry.
Okay, why is that?

16:11.132 --> 16:13.598
I've been looking at
my accounts online.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.769
There's money missing.

16:16.771 --> 16:18.303
Look, of course there is.

16:18.305 --> 16:19.804
Okay, I-I've had to
shift things around

16:19.806 --> 16:21.839
to pay for your medical bills,
your utilities...

16:21.841 --> 16:23.440
Bull!

16:23.442 --> 16:26.878
I know what you're doing,
and it's gonna stop.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.980
Do you know how paranoid
you sound right now?

16:28.982 --> 16:32.583
I'd rather be p-p-paranoid
than stupid.

16:32.585 --> 16:34.085
Look, if... if...

16:34.087 --> 16:35.852
If you will just give me
a chance to explain...

16:35.854 --> 16:37.754
Give me my cane.

16:40.825 --> 16:45.528
I said, give me my cane.

17:01.511 --> 17:02.544
Hello?

17:02.546 --> 17:04.313
Hey, it's me.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.316
Marisol, why are you calling
at this hour?

17:07.318 --> 17:09.184
It's 1:00
in the afternoon.

17:12.387 --> 17:13.488
Oh, s...

17:13.490 --> 17:15.388
Sorry, I'm a little hungover.

17:15.391 --> 17:16.790
On a Tuesday?

17:16.792 --> 17:18.959
Why are you being so loud?

17:18.961 --> 17:21.395
Can we meet for breakfast
tomorrow?

17:21.396 --> 17:23.497
This thing happened with Nick,

17:23.499 --> 17:25.700
and I need someone to talk to
about it.

17:25.702 --> 17:28.469
Sure. Yeah, we can meet.

17:28.471 --> 17:31.838
But I probably won't be eating
ever again.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.374
I'll pick you up
at 8:00.

17:34.376 --> 17:36.275
Bye.

17:36.277 --> 17:37.811
Spence!

17:37.813 --> 17:39.512
It's 1:00 in the afternoon.

17:39.514 --> 17:41.514
We have to get up
and start our day.

17:43.585 --> 17:45.318
Okay.

17:46.419 --> 17:48.520
Ugh.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.994
Mr. Kenneth, I'm home.

17:55.996 --> 17:59.030
I got those pork chops
you like.

18:01.401 --> 18:03.534
Hmm.

18:03.536 --> 18:05.503
Mr. Kenneth?

18:07.172 --> 18:10.842
Mr. Kenneth,
I found your cane.

18:16.448 --> 18:18.948
Mr. Kenneth?

18:18.950 --> 18:19.949
Hey.

18:19.951 --> 18:23.520
Where is your Uncle?

18:23.522 --> 18:26.256
Afraid I have
some bad news. Um...

18:26.258 --> 18:27.457
Uncle Ken had a fall.

18:27.459 --> 18:28.925
What?

18:28.927 --> 18:30.527
I think he was trying
to walk up the stairs.

18:30.529 --> 18:32.696
But he's not strong enough
for that.

18:32.698 --> 18:34.597
I know.

18:34.599 --> 18:36.532
So where is he now?

18:36.534 --> 18:37.600
Doheny Medical Center.

18:37.602 --> 18:40.269
Oh, my God.
I got to go see him.

18:40.271 --> 18:41.737
Oh... oh, sorry.
He...

18:41.739 --> 18:44.807
He's in real bad shape.
Only family can see him.

18:44.809 --> 18:47.877
I am very close
to Mr. Kenneth.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.945
But you're not family.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.287
Hello, mother.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.756
I'm back.

19:01.758 --> 19:04.959
Well, if it ain't
the queen of the may.

19:04.961 --> 19:09.763
What happened?
Did your spa run out of caviar?

19:09.765 --> 19:14.034
I have something I need to say
to you, mother.

19:14.036 --> 19:16.470
Hopefully, once you hear this,

19:16.472 --> 19:19.306
we can finally establish
some sort of relationship.

19:19.308 --> 19:23.609
Oh, we have a relationship.

19:23.611 --> 19:28.380
I'm the mother who takes a bus
across the country to come here,

19:28.382 --> 19:30.683
and you're
the ungrateful daughter

19:30.685 --> 19:32.952
who doesn't give a moose fart.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.286
See?

19:34.288 --> 19:35.788
I've been here one minute,

19:35.790 --> 19:37.757
and she's already assaulting me
with profanity.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.591
Just be strong.

19:42.562 --> 19:43.528
Mother...

19:46.699 --> 19:48.934
I was 7 years old
when I found out

19:48.936 --> 19:51.970
that most mothers don't belittle
their own children.

19:51.972 --> 19:56.474
For a long time, I thought there
was something wrong with me,

19:56.476 --> 19:58.809
that I deserved your cruelty.

19:58.811 --> 20:02.045
But the truth is,
you're just an unhappy woman,

20:02.047 --> 20:05.916
so filled with anger and bile,

20:05.918 --> 20:08.619
you lash out at anyone
who gets too close.

20:10.488 --> 20:12.689
Oh, don't look so wounded.
You know it's true.

20:12.691 --> 20:15.224
- No, Genevieve, I...
- Let her finish this.

20:16.827 --> 20:19.128
Go ahead.

20:19.398 --> 20:24.333
I can forgive the past, mother.
But only if I know our future

20:24.335 --> 20:27.870
is filled with kindness
and mutual respect.

20:27.872 --> 20:31.940
If you can't be bothered
to even pretend to love me,

20:31.942 --> 20:35.243
well, you can just go to hell.

20:37.781 --> 20:39.047
I can't believe it.

20:39.049 --> 20:42.683
- I finally stood up to her.
- I am so proud of you.

20:42.685 --> 20:44.519
Thank you for standing by me.

20:44.521 --> 20:47.555
I couldn't have talked to
my mother like that without you.

20:47.557 --> 20:50.024
You did good.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.278
Thank God you're back.
How's your mother doing?

21:09.879 --> 21:13.647
Oh, my God.
Is she dead?

21:13.649 --> 21:15.782
No!

21:15.784 --> 21:17.818
What?

21:19.054 --> 21:22.455
It was coronary angina.

21:22.457 --> 21:24.891
Some minor problem
with her heart.

21:24.893 --> 21:28.095
I tried to tell the doctors
she doesn't have one,

21:28.097 --> 21:29.763
but they wouldn't listen.

21:29.765 --> 21:31.964
Honey, I don't think
you should joke about this.

21:31.966 --> 21:33.099
I know.

21:33.101 --> 21:36.102
It's awful.
But I can't help it.

21:36.738 --> 21:41.107
- I was ready for her to die.
- Genevieve!

21:41.109 --> 21:45.778
I wish you could have heard her
attack me in E.R.,

21:45.780 --> 21:48.547
the horrible things she said.

21:48.549 --> 21:50.315
And then it hit me...

21:50.317 --> 21:52.284
She's never gonna be nice
to me.

21:52.286 --> 21:54.085
Well, probably not.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.189
If she had died,
maybe I could have held on

21:58.191 --> 22:00.759
to the last shred of love
I feel for her.

22:00.761 --> 22:03.594
But she will keep on
torturing me,

22:03.596 --> 22:08.165
and I will end up as angry
and hate-filled as she is.

22:08.167 --> 22:10.468
Even so,
you can't give up on her.

22:10.470 --> 22:12.169
She's your mother.

22:12.171 --> 22:13.504
Not really.

22:13.506 --> 22:16.440
You're more of a mother to me
than she is.

22:16.442 --> 22:19.609
You do realize
you're older than me, right?

22:19.611 --> 22:22.245
What is a mother, anyway?

22:22.247 --> 22:24.414
It's someone
who cares about you

22:24.416 --> 22:29.385
and teaches you how to behave
and makes you feel safe.

22:29.387 --> 22:30.803
All right.

22:32.156 --> 22:34.523
If you really think of me
as your mother...

22:34.525 --> 22:36.592
And I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

22:36.594 --> 22:39.161
But if you mean that...

22:39.163 --> 22:40.629
I do.

22:40.631 --> 22:43.564
Then you'll obey me when I
tell you to do something, right?

22:43.566 --> 22:45.866
Uh...

22:45.868 --> 22:49.236
You are going to stick by
your mother.

22:49.238 --> 22:52.106
And when she's difficult
and insults you,

22:52.108 --> 22:54.575
you're gonna let those comments
slide right off.

22:54.577 --> 22:56.844
You make it sound so easy.

22:56.846 --> 22:58.612
It won't be.

22:58.614 --> 23:00.814
But you're gonna take
the high road,

23:00.816 --> 23:03.383
and you're gonna give that woman
the respect and dignity

23:03.385 --> 23:05.118
she refuses to give you.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.754
Why would I do that?

23:07.756 --> 23:11.458
Because... and I'm getting more
comfortable with this...

23:11.460 --> 23:13.293
That's how I raised you.

23:19.366 --> 23:22.335
<i>Eres un ladron! ¿Me oyes?
Deberias estar en la carcel!</i>

23:22.337 --> 23:23.502
Ah!

23:23.504 --> 23:25.338
What's wrong?

23:25.340 --> 23:28.674
This guy wants $2,000 to fix
the transmission on my car,

23:28.676 --> 23:30.308
and he refused to negotiate.

23:30.310 --> 23:32.109
I'm sorry you're having
a bad day,

23:32.111 --> 23:33.845
but I got something
to cheer you up.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.913
Thanks, but I don't think so.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.282
Uh, come on!

23:38.284 --> 23:39.250
Uh... you won't have to do
laundry

23:39.252 --> 23:40.218
for the rest of the week.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.219
No.

23:41.221 --> 23:43.154
I'm done drinking for a while.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.489
Carmen?

23:45.491 --> 23:47.624
Uh...

23:47.626 --> 23:48.925
Please.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.428
I just need
someone to talk to.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.997
We can talk without drinking.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.599
Yeah, but drinking's
what makes it fun.

23:55.601 --> 23:56.900
Spence.

23:57.490 --> 24:00.604
- I'll pay for your transmission.
- Seriously?

24:00.606 --> 24:04.039
Yeah, we're friends.
Friends help each other out.

24:05.442 --> 24:06.576
Well...

24:06.578 --> 24:08.644
- Maybe just one drink.
- Great.

24:16.152 --> 24:18.253
Now, when I squeeze
your shoulder,

24:18.255 --> 24:21.723
that's when you say
the magic word, okay?

24:21.725 --> 24:23.258
Okay.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.459
It's over here.

24:25.628 --> 24:26.995
Can I help you?

24:26.997 --> 24:28.563
We're looking for
Kenneth Miller.

24:28.565 --> 24:30.832
Miller, let's see.

24:30.834 --> 24:32.434
Oh, I'm sorry, it says here

24:32.436 --> 24:33.834
that only family is permitted
to see him.

24:33.836 --> 24:34.902
That's okay.

24:34.904 --> 24:36.404
We are family.

24:36.406 --> 24:38.305
Really?

24:38.307 --> 24:40.240
I'm his
daughter-in-law, Rosie,

24:40.242 --> 24:42.242
and this is his grandson,
Miguel.

24:43.311 --> 24:46.680
Uh...
You are not on the list.

24:46.682 --> 24:48.549
Well, that's weird.

24:48.551 --> 24:53.653
Well, I just wanted to bring him
this drawing from his grandson.

24:53.655 --> 24:55.988
But if you're not
on the list...

24:55.990 --> 24:58.458
Please?

24:58.460 --> 25:01.260
Oh...

25:01.262 --> 25:03.430
So, what did you draw?
Unicorns?

25:04.498 --> 25:06.832
Please?

25:08.668 --> 25:09.835
He worked so hard on this.

25:11.370 --> 25:14.172
Well, I suppose I can let you in
for a second,

25:14.174 --> 25:15.874
but your son's
going to have to stay here.

25:15.876 --> 25:16.975
That's okay.

25:16.977 --> 25:19.010
I trust you.

25:19.012 --> 25:20.512
Down the hall to your right.
Room 210.

25:27.619 --> 25:30.455
<i>Santo Dios.</i>

25:30.457 --> 25:31.622
Excuse me...

25:31.624 --> 25:33.691
Why does he have
all those tubes?

25:33.693 --> 25:35.225
He just fell.

25:35.227 --> 25:37.461
He was pretty agitated
when he came in, poor guy.

25:37.463 --> 25:38.795
What do you mean?

25:38.797 --> 25:40.897
He was arguing with the man
who brought him in.

25:40.899 --> 25:42.131
I think it was his nephew.

25:42.133 --> 25:44.000
We had to sedate him
just to calm him down.

25:44.002 --> 25:47.471
Whose idea was that?
His nephew's?

25:47.473 --> 25:49.873
As a matter of fact, yeah.

25:54.478 --> 25:58.614
I'm so sorry about this,
Mr. Kenneth.

25:58.616 --> 26:00.349
And I don't know how,

26:00.351 --> 26:03.285
but I'm going to get you
out of here.

26:14.788 --> 26:16.547
_

26:18.968 --> 26:20.969
Look, it's right there
in the second paragraph.

26:20.971 --> 26:23.404
"A witness says one of the
robbers was stabbed with a knife

26:23.406 --> 26:24.506
before he got away."

26:24.508 --> 26:25.572
Oh, my God.

26:25.574 --> 26:27.941
The police think it's the same
gang who killed Alejandro Rubio.

26:27.943 --> 26:30.677
That's why I ran two red lights
getting over here. Where is Ethan?

26:30.679 --> 26:34.280
- He's sleeping.
- Well, wake him up!

26:34.282 --> 26:35.616
Wait!
It's not possible.

26:35.618 --> 26:38.418
- Ethan couldn't kill someone.
- You sure about that?

26:38.420 --> 26:40.988
'Cause if he was involved
and the police find out,

26:40.990 --> 26:42.889
well, he's not the only one
who will be arrested here.

26:42.891 --> 26:44.490
What do you mean?

26:44.492 --> 26:46.358
I mean you drove him here,
I stitched him up.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.628
That makes us accomplices
after the fact.

26:48.630 --> 26:50.062
But we're not sure he did this.

26:50.064 --> 26:51.397
That's why you need to wake up
your boyfriend

26:51.399 --> 26:52.532
and get him to tell you
the truth.

26:52.534 --> 26:54.066
What if he won't?

26:54.068 --> 26:55.668
Well, then, you'll know he
doesn't really love you,

26:55.670 --> 26:57.836
and then you can stop
protecting him.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.542
This is gonna end badly
for Ethan, huh?

27:03.544 --> 27:06.811
That's why you've got to be
smart and do the right thing...

27:06.813 --> 27:08.813
So it doesn't end badly
for you.

27:27.811 --> 27:29.464
Carmen?

27:31.345 --> 27:32.968
Carmen?

27:34.218 --> 27:35.918
We were supposed to have
breakfast today.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.786
Did you forget?

27:42.859 --> 27:45.760
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

27:46.796 --> 27:48.930
You know what happens to people
that break into my house?

27:48.932 --> 27:49.864
I stab them.

27:50.966 --> 27:53.334
Like this! This!

27:53.336 --> 27:57.071
Oh, yes, you're very dangerous.
Okay, time to get up.

27:57.073 --> 27:59.207
Oh, there we go.
Ooh.

27:59.209 --> 28:01.675
Ay, why do you make me
stand up?

28:01.677 --> 28:03.810
Now I can feel the hangover.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.346
And I can smell your breath,
so we're even.

28:06.348 --> 28:07.814
Ugh...
Sort of.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.649
Carmen!

28:10.985 --> 28:12.285
Have you seen my pants?

28:12.287 --> 28:14.054
Oh, lord.
They're in the dryer.

28:14.056 --> 28:15.889
Remember?
You threw up on them.

28:15.891 --> 28:17.757
Oh, yeah.

28:17.759 --> 28:20.125
Hey!
You're Rosie's friend.

28:20.127 --> 28:22.228
And you're half naked.

28:23.330 --> 28:26.131
Well, would you look at that?

28:28.534 --> 28:30.802
What exactly happened here
last night?

28:30.804 --> 28:33.973
Relax, okay?
We didn't sleep together.

28:34.275 --> 28:35.906
Are you sure?

28:35.908 --> 28:37.642
Just because I had a few drinks

28:37.644 --> 28:40.444
doesn't mean that I'm gonna stop
acting like a lady.

28:44.483 --> 28:46.317
Carmen.

28:46.319 --> 28:49.053
You need to understand
what this looks like...

28:49.055 --> 28:52.088
A live-in maid getting drunk
with her employer?

28:52.090 --> 28:53.690
Spence is having
a rough time.

28:53.692 --> 28:55.358
He needed somebody
to talk to.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.793
So we had a few,

28:56.795 --> 28:59.296
and we discussed our lives,
and that's it.

28:59.298 --> 29:01.097
Well, I believe you.

29:01.099 --> 29:03.233
But what would Rosie think
if she knew about this?

29:04.335 --> 29:06.169
Oh, that's a good point.

29:06.171 --> 29:07.736
Okay.

29:07.738 --> 29:09.805
I won't drink with Spence
anymore.

29:09.807 --> 29:12.408
But we had
the most amazing conversation.

29:12.410 --> 29:14.042
How amazing
could it have been

29:14.044 --> 29:16.612
when you're both three sheets
to the wind?

29:16.614 --> 29:18.113
You'd be surprised.

29:18.115 --> 29:19.781
One the liquor is poured,

29:19.783 --> 29:23.418
the walls come down
and the secrets come out.

29:25.688 --> 29:30.191
Carmen, do you think the same
thing happens with pain pills?

29:30.193 --> 29:31.326
Sure.

29:31.328 --> 29:35.196
We all want to tell the truth.
Some of us just need a crutch.

29:40.067 --> 29:42.436
Hello?!

29:42.438 --> 29:44.538
Anybody?!

29:48.611 --> 29:50.611
What are you doing?

29:51.548 --> 29:53.347
I'm not a potted plant.

29:53.349 --> 29:56.482
You can't just stick me in
the corner and forget about me.

29:56.484 --> 29:58.684
We didn't forget about you.

29:58.686 --> 30:01.787
Zoila was just helping me pack
for our trip back to Oklahoma.

30:01.789 --> 30:04.624
Crap in heaven,
what are you wearing?

30:04.626 --> 30:06.492
Dolce and Gabbana.

30:06.494 --> 30:08.761
I'm just trying to look stylish
for my mother.

30:08.763 --> 30:11.363
Oh, you're just trying
to show off.

30:11.365 --> 30:15.833
Been like that since she was 3.
Wasn't cute then, either.

30:16.544 --> 30:18.703
If you want me to change,
I will.

30:18.705 --> 30:20.705
Why are you being so nice?

30:20.707 --> 30:23.541
She's being a good daughter.
And you should get going.

30:23.543 --> 30:25.009
You don't want to miss
your plane.

30:25.011 --> 30:28.279
Well, don't just stand there
looking ethnic.

30:28.281 --> 30:29.246
Push me.

30:30.348 --> 30:33.717
I'll let Genevieve push you.
It'll be safer for you.

30:35.153 --> 30:37.521
Hey, you want your bell back?

30:37.523 --> 30:38.422
Keep it.

30:38.424 --> 30:39.690
As a souvenir.

30:39.692 --> 30:42.559
Oh, my bags are packed.
I don't know where I'd put it.

30:42.561 --> 30:46.763
- I have an idea.
- Here we go.

30:46.765 --> 30:49.332
- Careful.
- Yes, mother.

30:49.334 --> 30:51.734
You never did know
how to drive.

30:51.736 --> 30:54.036
I remember when you were 16,

30:54.038 --> 30:57.607
you dented the Fender
of my Pontiac.

30:57.609 --> 31:01.009
$46 I'll never see again.

31:01.011 --> 31:04.078
I told you
not to take the car out.

31:08.150 --> 31:09.718
Well?

31:12.388 --> 31:15.290
It's a long story.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.791
You might want to take a seat.

31:19.494 --> 31:22.297
We were just
four stupid teenagers

31:22.299 --> 31:24.165
bitching about life
and how unfair it is,

31:24.167 --> 31:26.467
and then we had this idea
to steal from the rich

31:26.469 --> 31:28.669
and give to the poor.
It sounded so simple.

31:28.671 --> 31:30.771
No one was supposed to
get hurt.

31:30.773 --> 31:34.574
- How could you be that stupid?
- I don't know.

31:34.576 --> 31:36.977
Val, I am so sorry.

31:40.215 --> 31:42.615
I can forgive you...

31:42.617 --> 31:44.852
If you take responsibility.

31:45.540 --> 31:46.920
What do you mean?

31:48.288 --> 31:50.389
You want me to
turn myself in?

31:50.391 --> 31:52.591
If you did,
they might go easy on you.

31:52.593 --> 31:54.526
No.
Alejandro is dead.

31:54.528 --> 31:56.729
If the police find out
I was involved, my life is over.

31:56.731 --> 32:00.566
They're gonna catch you.
It's only a matter of time.

32:00.568 --> 32:02.902
Then let's run away.

32:02.904 --> 32:05.636
Huh? To Tahiti or... or...
Or South America.

32:05.638 --> 32:07.672
We can build a
whole new life.

32:09.175 --> 32:11.276
I like my life just as it is.

32:11.278 --> 32:16.155
I feel awful about what I did.
I do. But...

32:16.649 --> 32:18.549
I can't go to prison.

32:19.430 --> 32:21.785
If you love me,

32:21.787 --> 32:23.954
you'll find a way
to do the right thing.

32:34.565 --> 32:36.432
Valentina,
w-what are you doing?

32:36.434 --> 32:38.734
I'm going.

32:38.736 --> 32:42.171
But I won't tell the police
what you've done.

32:42.173 --> 32:43.973
Valentina, come on.

32:47.618 --> 32:51.932
- I don't have a choice here.
- You've always had choices.

32:52.516 --> 32:55.850
You just keep making
the wrong ones.

33:22.277 --> 33:25.645
Oh, for God's sake.

33:38.492 --> 33:39.725
License and registration.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.294
Okay.

33:42.296 --> 33:44.229
Miss, do you know why
I pulled you over?

33:45.265 --> 33:47.266
Your vehicle was swerving.

33:47.268 --> 33:48.567
Sorry about that.

33:48.569 --> 33:51.536
I was crying,
so I reached for a tissue.

33:51.538 --> 33:52.438
Rough night, huh?

33:53.606 --> 33:54.773
Yeah.

34:01.913 --> 34:03.547
What's that on
your back seat?

34:03.549 --> 34:06.750
Oh, uh...

34:06.752 --> 34:09.452
Nothing.

34:09.487 --> 34:11.255
Is that blood?

34:22.889 --> 34:24.658
Mm.

34:24.659 --> 34:26.092
You're back
from the grocery store.

34:26.094 --> 34:27.393
Did you get us some Tequila?

34:28.596 --> 34:29.862
No.

34:29.864 --> 34:31.498
I thought we were doing shots
tonight.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.933
Thanks, but I'm on the wagon.

34:33.935 --> 34:35.735
So, we're not gonna have
a little party?

34:35.737 --> 34:38.737
I think the party's over.
For both of us.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.072
I had a bad week.
I'm allowed to dull the pain.

34:41.074 --> 34:42.708
Every night, Spence?

34:42.710 --> 34:43.909
Till you pass out?

34:47.147 --> 34:48.914
She took my kid.

34:48.916 --> 34:52.117
Drinking won't get him back.

34:54.955 --> 34:59.924
I will stay up late, I will talk
to you, I will hold your hand.

34:59.926 --> 35:02.727
But I won't help you
become a drunk.

35:05.130 --> 35:07.598
Okay.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.100
Don't buy any more liquor.

35:09.102 --> 35:10.801
Really?

35:10.803 --> 35:15.105
I'll get my act together.
I promise.

35:15.107 --> 35:17.507
Okay.

35:51.874 --> 35:53.108
Hey.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.377
Where were you
this afternoon?

35:55.379 --> 35:56.344
Um...

35:56.346 --> 35:58.880
Miguel had a playdate.

35:58.882 --> 36:00.815
Oh.

36:00.817 --> 36:04.018
Well, I have been anxious
for you to get back.

36:04.020 --> 36:05.352
I have a little gift for you.

36:06.321 --> 36:07.487
What is it?

36:08.390 --> 36:10.391
Open it and find out.

36:13.728 --> 36:15.129
Oh, my God.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.331
- Do you like it?
- This looks expensive.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.999
It was.

36:20.001 --> 36:23.202
But where would you get the
money for something like this?

36:24.871 --> 36:26.472
It's a gift, Rosie.

36:26.474 --> 36:28.174
You really should just say
thank you.

36:28.176 --> 36:31.077
It's too much.
I can't take it.

36:31.079 --> 36:32.463
Of course you can.

36:33.148 --> 36:35.613
You're my girl.

36:35.615 --> 36:37.215
You got to let me spoil you
a little bit.

36:37.763 --> 36:41.085
- It would not be right.
- Rosie, just try it on.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.058
All right.

36:57.336 --> 36:58.735
Beautiful.

37:19.256 --> 37:20.423
How was your walk?

37:20.425 --> 37:23.058
Slow.
I got it from here.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.994
Just be careful. I'll be back
in a little while with his lunch.

37:24.996 --> 37:26.395
Thank you.

37:26.397 --> 37:28.730
Still in pain?
Oh, yeah.

37:28.732 --> 37:30.065
Why don't you take a pill?

37:30.067 --> 37:31.467
Huh?

37:31.469 --> 37:33.335
It's been a while
since you had one.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.837
Thought you didn't want me
to get addicted?

37:35.839 --> 37:38.206
Well, I don't want you
to suffer, either.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.443
No, I'm... I'm good.

37:44.980 --> 37:46.381
Okay.

37:46.383 --> 37:47.781
Have it your way.

37:47.783 --> 37:51.085
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.
I'll be right back.

38:25.185 --> 38:26.751
Hey.

38:26.753 --> 38:28.553
Thought you might like
some juice.

38:28.555 --> 38:30.255
Thanks.

38:35.027 --> 38:37.828
You didn't put a little
something in here, did you?

38:37.830 --> 38:39.964
What are you talking about?

38:41.567 --> 38:43.333
You know, I-I-I, uh...

38:43.335 --> 38:44.835
I'm not really thirsty.

38:46.171 --> 38:47.504
Fine.

38:47.506 --> 38:50.074
That's absolutely fine.

38:50.076 --> 38:51.141
Careful.

38:51.143 --> 38:53.644
See? You're in pain.
Have a pill.

38:53.646 --> 38:55.379
No.

38:55.381 --> 38:58.115
Well, then have some juice.
Stop trying to drug me!

39:06.390 --> 39:08.458
Afraid you might make
another confession?

39:11.062 --> 39:12.295
That's ridiculous.

39:13.297 --> 39:16.465
I always wondered,

39:16.467 --> 39:19.234
"why did you let Opal
stay in your house?"

39:19.236 --> 39:21.503
Now I get it.
She was blackmailing you.

39:21.505 --> 39:23.271
You know,
ii-I-I'm not feeling well.

39:23.273 --> 39:24.707
Who did you kill, Nick?

39:27.433 --> 39:29.653
Whatever you've done,
I will try to understand.

39:29.688 --> 39:32.480
But you have got to
tell me the truth.

39:37.987 --> 39:40.187
I'm not a murderer.

39:49.330 --> 39:52.146
When you get home,
I won't be there.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.140
No, no.
No, don't do that.

39:54.365 --> 39:55.442
Marisol...

39:55.773 --> 39:56.889
Please!

39:58.026 --> 39:59.754
Marisol please...

39:59.789 --> 40:01.010
Marisol!

40:02.305 --> 40:08.806
