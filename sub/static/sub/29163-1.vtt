02:13.334 --> 02:14.233

02:17.304 --> 02:18.604
Sebek.

02:18.606 --> 02:22.574
(speaking in foreign language)

02:34.321 --> 02:35.220
Sebek.

02:37.158 --> 02:40.025
(speaking in foreign language)

02:40.027 --> 02:41.493
- Reheema.

02:41.495 --> 02:45.164
(speaking in foreign language)

02:45.166 --> 02:46.064
- Sebek.

(dust cloud swirling)

07:22.142 --> 07:25.210
(mystical tinkling)

07:28.882 --> 07:30.916
- [Narrator] The
lost city of Saqqara,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.820
home of the first man.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.789
Built from clay.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.427
U-khany Sesebek and
his love Reheema Mense

07:43.564 --> 07:46.898
have been reincarnate
lovers for centuries.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.569
Legends evolve over time.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.939
No one knows exactly
where it all began.

07:55.209 --> 07:58.310
A tale of two lovers
charged with great purpose.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.747
A love meant to bring
about prosperity and riches

08:02.749 --> 08:03.748
to the great lands.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.221
(people shouting)
(mystical tinkling)

08:09.223 --> 08:12.390
A bond meant to be
carried out for eternity

08:13.227 --> 08:15.927
centered around a stone mazar.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.071
(dramatic groaning)

08:27.674 --> 08:30.976
The two lovers charged
with great purpose,

08:30.978 --> 08:33.445
fueled by an unbreakable bond,

08:33.447 --> 08:37.816
maintained the cycle of
balance for centuries.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.885
Great kings and gods clashed

08:40.888 --> 08:43.788
all seeking the
lost city of Saqqara

08:43.789 --> 08:45.991
and the power of the stone.

08:45.993 --> 08:49.060
(soldiers shouting)

08:54.234 --> 08:57.135
(mystical tinkling)

08:57.137 --> 09:00.272
A different prophecy
has come to light.

09:00.274 --> 09:03.041
(fire crackling)

09:04.778 --> 09:07.112
One of wrath and vengeance,

09:08.849 --> 09:12.584
and if ever unleashed,
the two scorned lovers

09:13.520 --> 09:15.954
will bring about the apocalypse.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.201
(adventurous music)

09:30.203 --> 09:32.938
(guns blasting)

09:42.816 --> 09:44.049
- You just couldn't
resist, could ya?

09:44.051 --> 09:45.383
- We are treasure
hunters, right?

09:45.385 --> 09:48.587
(guns blasting)

09:48.589 --> 09:51.022
I mean, we can't just borrow.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.090
- Free bird.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.392
Free bird.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.830
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.434
(guns blasting)

10:11.478 --> 10:14.045
Why don't you come out
real nice and slow like?

10:14.047 --> 10:16.114
We can kiss and make up.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.850
(guns blasting)

10:59.559 --> 11:00.425
- Daniela.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.495
You mind telling me what
all the fuss was about?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.964
- The lost city of Saqqara.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.533
- [Noe] A map.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.468
- Not a map, the map.

11:14.675 --> 11:15.573
This can't be.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.844
Noe, take a look at this.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.947
- That's disgusting.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.649
- Just...

11:26.386 --> 11:27.318
Would you?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.953
Oh God, that's disgusting.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.590
- Looks recent.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.758
- That's not possible.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.063
(gun cocking)
- What are you doing?

11:38.065 --> 11:39.764
- Every time you say
that's not possible

11:39.766 --> 11:42.033
something impossible happens.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.034
- That's...

11:43.036 --> 11:44.135
That's absurd.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.372
- Do you remember our
other cave guy, Bismak?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.175
- Of course I do.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.478
- Tall, kind, bit of an
oddball, but congenial.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.013
What about him?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.748
- He died getting us the
coordinates to this place

11:56.750 --> 11:59.184
after you said that
it was impossible

11:59.186 --> 12:01.286
the ancient priests of
Saqqara would dare think

12:01.288 --> 12:04.055
to booby trap the entrance
to an embalming chamber.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.557
- Well, now that you mention it,

12:05.559 --> 12:06.424
I wasn't that fond of him.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.325
- Mm.

12:09.629 --> 12:13.131
Well, good thing he had a brother
who doesn't speak English.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.404
- I found the map to the
lost city of Saqqara.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.772
- Questionable.
- And you're going on

12:20.774 --> 12:22.273
about booby traps.
- A man's death.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.743
- And caves when we could very
well be standing in a place

12:24.745 --> 12:26.578
that's over 5000 years old.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.146
- 4800 B.C.
- Yeah, whatever.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.583
- The lost city of Saqqara,

12:31.585 --> 12:33.451
where the first
pharaoh was born.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.986
- I went to the
same school as you.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.054
I know the tales.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.591
Pharaoh's would be charged
with reincarnating two lovers

12:39.593 --> 12:41.226
to bring about a
plentiful harvest

12:41.228 --> 12:42.961
and renewal to their kingdoms.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.263
A cycle that must be continued

12:45.265 --> 12:47.699
or risk the wrath of the gods.

12:47.701 --> 12:50.201
- A risk that Pharaoh
Tesnemar did not heed.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.878
(rumbling)
- He wanted their power

12:59.880 --> 13:02.180
to live forever and got
greedy in the process.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.114
Cursed his kingdom.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.415
Blah blah blah blah blah.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.383
(dramatic instrumental music)

13:05.385 --> 13:07.752
- [Daniela] Be careful!

13:07.754 --> 13:09.821
(sighs)

13:18.999 --> 13:21.132
(wind howling)

13:21.134 --> 13:22.534
U-khany Sesebek.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.540
(rumbling)

13:28.542 --> 13:30.942
- Hey, Biyombo, could you...

13:35.882 --> 13:36.781
- What?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.754
(wind howling)

13:43.690 --> 13:44.823
A seal.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.593
(speaking foreign language)

13:48.595 --> 13:53.665
(dramatic groaning)
(wind howling)

13:57.637 --> 13:58.570
- That's...

13:59.673 --> 14:00.538
Weird.

14:06.813 --> 14:10.548
(speaking foreign language)

14:19.125 --> 14:19.958
(dramatic groaning)

14:19.960 --> 14:22.293
(shouting)

14:25.732 --> 14:27.532
- The seal is odd.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.300
- Odd as in good

14:31.238 --> 14:32.670
or odd weird?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.743
- I don't know, but I've never
seen markings like these.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.414
And for this time period,
it seems inconsistent.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.349
- I thought the
lost city of Saqqara

14:44.351 --> 14:46.084
was of the old continent.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.720
- Precisely, but this symbol.

14:50.790 --> 14:54.225
It's unlike any carbon fiber
or protein I've ever seen.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.495
I mean, the only thing I
have to compare it to...

14:57.497 --> 14:58.429
Unless.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.835
That's not possible.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.504
(dramatic music)

15:06.506 --> 15:08.973
(man shouts)

15:21.121 --> 15:23.087
(sizzling)

15:23.089 --> 15:25.390
(groaning)

15:30.263 --> 15:33.231
(distant shouting)

15:34.100 --> 15:35.833
- Biyombo.
- Biyombo.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.269
- Biyombo!

15:39.339 --> 15:40.238
Hang on!

15:51.418 --> 15:52.350
Do you hear that?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.055
Hm.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.559
Nothing.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.931
- He didn't bury Reheema in
the lost city of Saqqara.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.301
- How can you be so sure?

16:11.438 --> 16:15.039
- Because the lost city
of Saqqara isn't a city.

16:23.817 --> 16:24.382
Look.

16:27.721 --> 16:30.288
(flute music)

16:51.845 --> 16:54.145
(spitting)

17:05.090 --> 17:08.992
(dramatic instrumental music)

17:29.883 --> 17:32.383
We are to be the
first to find Sebek.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.684
That was the arrangement.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.722
The tablet we found is
not of Egyptian origin.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.223
That can only mean one thing.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.426
- This is it.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.995
- The power of the gods.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.966
Seriously, look at you.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.837
You didn't think I
came all this way,

17:52.839 --> 17:57.909
tolerated your little
sandbox adventures, for what?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.246
Treasures and riches?

18:04.150 --> 18:07.785
The stone of Zahad is
the key to the one thing

18:09.022 --> 18:10.588
that money cannot buy.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.492
- Texts of Hades.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.363
(crow cawing)

18:25.905 --> 18:27.538
- Now.

18:27.540 --> 18:32.543
If we're quite done with the
bravado and the pleasantries

18:34.747 --> 18:36.380
please get on with it, my dear.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.152
What have you found?

18:52.732 --> 18:56.634
(dramatic instrumental music)

19:09.149 --> 19:10.481
(distant crashing)

19:10.483 --> 19:11.382
- Be careful.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.028
- Obsidian basalt.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.831
Used as a false mask to hide
the tablet's true origin.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.645
- Are these men
really necessary?

19:45.084 --> 19:48.286
- These men are part
of the Piyidi tribe

19:49.088 --> 19:51.189
trying to protect their lands

19:51.191 --> 19:54.225
from the principality
that keeps the rivers dry

19:54.227 --> 19:56.994
and the people poor so
please show some respect.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.969
- One can never be too careful

20:04.971 --> 20:09.006
especially in a tomb
that predates the...

20:09.008 --> 20:12.777
- Sager, our job
was to find Sebek

20:12.779 --> 20:15.079
and conclude a search
that began ages ago,

20:15.081 --> 20:17.048
a search for the
lost city of Saqqara.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.752
- Well, I suggest
you do your job.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.437
- This is...

20:39.439 --> 20:40.304
This is it.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.682
The encryption reads,

20:52.752 --> 20:55.820
"follow that which
unveils itself in fire.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.977
"And in light never before."

21:22.215 --> 21:23.214
- Fire.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.416
Are you sure?

21:26.686 --> 21:28.152
It has to be something more.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.962
(distant creaking)

21:49.208 --> 21:50.441
(clattering)

21:50.443 --> 21:55.212
(walls rumbling)
(dramatic groaning)

21:55.782 --> 21:58.115
(men gasping)

22:12.065 --> 22:13.497
- I didn't see that coming.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.595
(dramatic music)

22:49.836 --> 22:53.371
(people muttering softly)

23:01.180 --> 23:03.047
- You sure about this?

23:12.458 --> 23:14.859
- If we find the lost
city of Saqqara first

23:14.861 --> 23:16.093
we can renew the cycle.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.899
What better way to stop
it, but from the inside?

23:23.770 --> 23:27.671
(dramatic instrumental music)

23:56.502 --> 23:58.402
Besides, you really
think it'll stop?

24:13.152 --> 24:15.820
(somber music)

24:25.264 --> 24:26.197
Be careful!

24:29.602 --> 24:32.169
It's very rare to have an
unguarded tomb this far

24:32.171 --> 24:34.672
from Anubis or even
the feet of Horus.

24:37.577 --> 24:38.876
- What is this place?

24:39.879 --> 24:40.778
- Hatusun.

24:42.949 --> 24:43.948
The room...

24:49.622 --> 24:50.955
of the in between.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.528
- [Chaka] This place is cursed.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.765
(people whispering)

25:21.721 --> 25:24.021
(shouting)

25:40.072 --> 25:40.971
- Stay calm.

25:46.679 --> 25:47.945
What are the men saying?

25:49.482 --> 25:52.182
- [Chaka] The men believe
this place is pure evil.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.985
(men whispering)

26:08.334 --> 26:09.233
- Hatusun.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.703
There's something written here.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.939
(blowing)

26:16.409 --> 26:20.811
In this life or in the
depths of the underworld

26:20.813 --> 26:23.547
(men muttering)

26:43.502 --> 26:48.238
(air blowing)
(gasping)

26:49.442 --> 26:51.775
(rumbling)

27:13.566 --> 27:17.334
(man shouting in
foreign language)

27:17.336 --> 27:18.769
- Calm.

27:18.771 --> 27:19.670
Stay calm.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.605
- Daniela.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.588
(breathing heavily)

27:37.590 --> 27:39.890
(coughing)

27:51.804 --> 27:53.337
Holy shit.

27:53.339 --> 27:58.008
(people muttering
in foreign language)

28:02.381 --> 28:03.280
Do you think?

28:04.817 --> 28:06.050
- It is Sebek.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.087
- He looks scorched.

28:26.872 --> 28:27.771
Oh my God.

28:30.643 --> 28:32.042
- No.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.611
No mummy I've ever researched
has appeared this way.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.586
- They burned him alive
inside the sarcophagus.

28:50.663 --> 28:53.130
- But there's a message here.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.909
The path to life
begins with death.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.017
And there's something else.

29:16.889 --> 29:20.891
(speaking in foreign language)

29:22.027 --> 29:24.328
(rumbling)

29:25.397 --> 29:29.366
(chanting in foreign language)

29:36.008 --> 29:36.907
- Daniela.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.843
They want you

29:39.845 --> 29:42.913
to stop chanting the
evil words of a dead man.

29:49.488 --> 29:53.457
(chanting in foreign language)

30:01.934 --> 30:03.667
(growling)

30:03.669 --> 30:08.672
(gasping)
(dramatic music)

30:10.709 --> 30:11.608
Shit!

30:14.113 --> 30:17.848
(speaking foreign language)

30:26.392 --> 30:27.291
Hey!

30:28.327 --> 30:29.393
Oh shit.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.695
(groaning)

30:32.898 --> 30:35.632
(guns blasting)

30:47.513 --> 30:49.213
No time to site see!

30:55.588 --> 31:00.624
(growling)
(men chattering)

31:01.694 --> 31:04.428
(guns blasting)

31:19.879 --> 31:24.948
(mummies growling)
(guns blasting)

31:44.236 --> 31:47.271
(mummy growling)

31:47.273 --> 31:49.172
- That's not possible.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.775
- Let's talk about this after
we make it to the surface!

31:51.777 --> 31:56.813
(guns blasting)
(mummies growling)

32:14.233 --> 32:19.303
(mummies growling)
(guns blasting)

32:23.175 --> 32:25.509
(shouting)

32:27.246 --> 32:28.679
(whimpering)

32:28.681 --> 32:31.415
(guns blasting)

32:41.694 --> 32:43.860
- We must seal this tomb.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.830
- What about your men?

32:46.832 --> 32:49.366
- [Chaka] The men knew
what they signed up for.

32:49.368 --> 32:52.069
(guns blasting)

33:01.747 --> 33:02.913
- We must this seal this tomb.

33:02.915 --> 33:04.281
- No!

33:04.283 --> 33:06.450
I have to find the stone!

33:06.452 --> 33:09.519
We're close, I can feel it.

33:09.521 --> 33:12.823
- If we don't seal this tomb,
Sebek will regain his power.

33:12.825 --> 33:16.660
If that happens, there won't
be a world to live forever in.

33:23.369 --> 33:24.601
- Go.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.771
Forward, forward.
(guns blasting)

33:39.118 --> 33:42.052
- These formations must
be over 10,000 years old.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.892
- I think older.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.663
- [Chaka] They said this
place belonged to Hades.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.902
- In your stories, what was
the purpose of this place?

34:02.975 --> 34:05.242
(sighs)

34:05.244 --> 34:08.078
- It is said Sebek and Reheema
are to perform a ritual.

34:13.952 --> 34:17.920
(speaking in foreign language)

34:21.760 --> 34:24.161
A sacrifice of true love.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.101
- In my studies
we spoke of nahem,

34:31.103 --> 34:33.637
but it meant great curse.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.940
- There are many curses.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.878
- Like one of reincarnation,
over and over and over again.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.949
- No, it's much more than that.

34:52.357 --> 34:53.956
- [Noe] Your people are at war?

34:55.393 --> 35:00.464
- My people are victims
of the evil regime.

35:04.703 --> 35:09.439
It is not war if both
sides don't believe

35:09.441 --> 35:11.408
they are on the side of good.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.978
- Now that Sebek is
free, what of the legend

35:14.980 --> 35:16.046
of your stories?

35:18.250 --> 35:19.416
- I don't know.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.353
It wasn't supposed
to be possible.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.525
- We just woke an evil
creature from the dead.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.293
I'd say everything's
on the table.

35:40.105 --> 35:42.672
(gun cocking)

35:50.849 --> 35:55.919
- He needs two things to
perform the sacrifice.

35:58.190 --> 36:02.993
Something about that
pours from beneath

36:03.896 --> 36:06.696
that may reveal it.

36:10.102 --> 36:11.268
That's all I know.

36:14.072 --> 36:17.140
(suspenseful music)

36:47.539 --> 36:50.607
(monsters growling)

36:53.879 --> 36:56.213
(groaning)

37:03.555 --> 37:06.056
(screeching)

37:10.095 --> 37:12.429
(growling)

37:18.770 --> 37:21.271
(screeching)

37:22.874 --> 37:25.609
(tail whipping)

37:40.025 --> 37:45.095
(gun cocking)
(gun blasting)

37:45.631 --> 37:47.931
(growling)

37:54.306 --> 37:56.940
(gun blasting)

38:08.053 --> 38:10.453
(exploding)

38:25.704 --> 38:26.603
- Chaka!

38:28.040 --> 38:28.938
Come on!

38:32.944 --> 38:34.110
Hey, come on.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.314
Come on!

38:37.316 --> 38:41.384
- No, Sebek controls the dead.

38:41.386 --> 38:43.987
Reheema controls the living.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.058
The wounds are effecting him.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.225
We've gotta get him out of here.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.361
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.963
Stop, Sebek, not live time.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.065
Stop Sebek.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.735
Go, leave me, leave me.

38:58.737 --> 38:59.569
Go without me.

38:59.571 --> 39:00.770
It's not enough time.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.240
Stop Sebek, go.

39:06.111 --> 39:07.277
Go!

39:07.279 --> 39:10.246
(distant growling)

39:11.083 --> 39:12.415
Get outta here.

39:15.654 --> 39:18.288
(gun blasting)

39:22.594 --> 39:23.827
- [Dragich] I found something!

39:27.165 --> 39:29.899
(guns blasting)

39:30.902 --> 39:33.636
- [Noe] They're right behind me!

39:36.541 --> 39:39.442
(growling)
(gun blasting)

39:39.444 --> 39:40.944
- You must hurry!

39:48.387 --> 39:50.153
(grunting)

39:50.155 --> 39:51.187
- Disgusting!

39:51.189 --> 39:53.256
(creaking)

39:53.258 --> 39:55.925
(rumbling)

39:55.927 --> 39:57.494
- You were going to leave us!

39:59.264 --> 40:02.699
- Be careful, I'm here
under still order.

40:05.404 --> 40:10.340
As of now our business
is officially concluded.

40:11.676 --> 40:13.643
You failed me far
too many times.

40:15.013 --> 40:19.149
Because of you, I may have
lost the stone for good.

40:21.286 --> 40:24.254
I trust that you can
find your way stateside.

40:35.700 --> 40:40.503
- In what world would someone
like you be better than me.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.675
You were playing the
living dead from the start.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.114
- Let her go.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.951
We have to find Sebek.

40:55.821 --> 40:56.686
- No.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.089
- What do you mean?

41:01.126 --> 41:02.625
- I mean,

41:02.627 --> 41:05.862
something tells me Sebek is
the least of our worries.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.932
(suspenseful music)

41:23.215 --> 41:24.514
- Look at this.

41:33.959 --> 41:37.293
Saqqara often referenced
as the lost city.

41:38.630 --> 41:41.431
Believed to be located
under the Saharan Desert.

41:41.433 --> 41:45.368
Said to be only accessible by
means of the Stone of Zahad.

41:46.538 --> 41:48.771
Many have searched for
the city to no avail.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.208
- The Stone of Zahad.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.643
And Sager thinks
he'll be the first

41:53.645 --> 41:55.445
to unveil this
wonder to the world.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.948
But who is Zahad?

41:58.950 --> 42:01.417
Why would his stones
convey so much power?

42:01.419 --> 42:04.354
- Zahad translates
to all-knowing.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.389
He must have been a
deity of some kind.

42:07.526 --> 42:10.760
- And the Egyptian story
is lush with vegetation.

42:12.364 --> 42:14.197
An Egyptian version
of the creation story.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.665
- The stone must be the key.

42:18.270 --> 42:19.636
- But not just any key.

42:27.879 --> 42:31.781
(dramatic instrumental music)

42:36.488 --> 42:40.156
A gateway between this
world and the underworld.

42:42.594 --> 42:45.461
- For anyone to get a hold
of such a power if it exists

42:45.463 --> 42:47.530
would be infinitely dangerous.

42:47.532 --> 42:50.767
They could tip the scale
between who lives and who dies.

42:52.370 --> 42:54.270
- Immortality.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.438
True power.

43:02.180 --> 43:06.182
Sebek's tomb was
away from Horus.

43:07.652 --> 43:09.886
- Because he wasn't
of the royal court?

43:11.489 --> 43:14.958
- No, no, I think we're missing
the bigger picture here.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.360
- What do you mean?

43:19.397 --> 43:21.931
- If Sebek is back
from the dead, right,

43:21.933 --> 43:23.633
there's two questions.

43:23.635 --> 43:26.069
First, where's Reheema?

43:26.071 --> 43:27.570
Has she also been awakened?

43:27.572 --> 43:31.274
And second, what does he
need to renew the cycle?

43:32.444 --> 43:34.010
- Well, what does
he want with us?

43:34.012 --> 43:34.944
- I don't know.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.045
- Why would he spare your life?

43:38.783 --> 43:40.984
- Maybe he blames us
for awakening him.

43:44.556 --> 43:47.056
- Maybe he needs something.

43:48.893 --> 43:50.727
Something that
only we would know.

43:53.331 --> 43:54.297
Get down!

43:54.299 --> 43:59.035
(gun blasting)
(dramatic music)

44:04.109 --> 44:08.544
- It says here something was
used to sanctify Sebek's tomb.

44:08.546 --> 44:11.881
- Sebek's tomb?

44:11.883 --> 44:13.549
- The Scarab of Ra.

44:14.452 --> 44:16.252
The Scarab of Ra!

44:16.254 --> 44:20.990
- Wait for me!

44:24.329 --> 44:27.096
(gun cocking)

44:27.098 --> 44:29.766
(gun blasting)

44:50.955 --> 44:53.022
- What took you so long?

44:54.292 --> 44:57.760
- All the entry points
have been compromised.

44:57.762 --> 45:00.830
That thing took
down an entire unit.

45:05.136 --> 45:05.968
- That's not a thing.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.106
It's her.

45:11.876 --> 45:12.942
It's Reheema.

45:27.258 --> 45:29.192
Nothing leaves this room.

45:29.194 --> 45:30.293
Do you understand?

46:04.195 --> 46:06.996
(mummy growling)

46:09.134 --> 46:10.466
- Torch lights.

46:19.043 --> 46:22.111
(suspenseful music)

46:56.314 --> 46:57.814
(static buzzing)

46:57.816 --> 46:59.215
What do we have?

47:02.620 --> 47:05.354
(radio chatter)

47:19.204 --> 47:21.704
(radio chatter)

47:21.706 --> 47:24.607
(ground rumbling)

47:26.678 --> 47:28.644
(guns blasting)

47:28.646 --> 47:32.415
(mummy growling)
(man screaming)

47:32.417 --> 47:33.616
(man shouting)

47:33.618 --> 47:35.284
(thrilling music)

47:35.286 --> 47:36.285
(man screaming)

47:36.287 --> 47:39.021
(guns blasting)

47:55.240 --> 47:58.040
(mummy growling)

48:01.846 --> 48:06.916
(guns blasting)
(shells rattling)

48:10.688 --> 48:15.758
(men chattering)
(men shouting)

48:20.932 --> 48:24.901
(speaking in foreign language)

48:32.877 --> 48:34.010
- I don't know.

48:34.012 --> 48:37.747
(speaking foreign language)

48:46.024 --> 48:48.691
(somber music)

49:06.611 --> 49:09.679
(suspenseful music)

51:11.169 --> 51:14.070
(vase shattering)

51:19.911 --> 51:22.878
(voices muttering)

51:23.648 --> 51:25.448
- You, turn around.

51:25.450 --> 51:28.150
Turn around, let
me see your hands!

51:28.152 --> 51:29.085
What?

51:29.087 --> 51:31.787
(mummy growling)

51:31.789 --> 51:35.124
(thrilling music)

51:35.126 --> 51:37.860
(guns blasting)

52:00.818 --> 52:03.352
(gun blasting)

52:05.323 --> 52:07.556
(panting)

52:28.946 --> 52:31.180
- The Scarab of Ra is gone.

52:31.182 --> 52:32.548
He must have come back for it.

52:32.550 --> 52:34.049
- This is really bad.

52:34.051 --> 52:36.852
It looks like something that
we would uncover on a dig.

52:36.854 --> 52:38.020
- We have to go.

52:38.022 --> 52:39.221
- Well, let's
figure it out later.

52:39.223 --> 52:40.356
Let's get outta here!

53:00.344 --> 53:02.378
What the hell did
we just witness?

53:02.380 --> 53:05.147
- You know what, this
is significant, okay?

53:05.149 --> 53:07.049
It's not a coincidence
that he's back here now.

53:07.051 --> 53:08.651
- Well, let's
figure it out later.

53:08.653 --> 53:09.985
Right now we have to go.

53:09.987 --> 53:11.420
First we have to contact...

53:17.061 --> 53:18.327
- Hello, little birdie.

53:26.437 --> 53:27.937
Tell me what you know.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.506
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

53:30.508 --> 53:31.340
- The map.

53:31.342 --> 53:33.209
The scarab.

53:33.211 --> 53:34.109
Give 'em to me.

53:36.480 --> 53:39.582
- Look, there is no map, okay?

53:39.584 --> 53:40.816
We don't have time to be...

53:40.818 --> 53:41.650
(fist smashing)
(groaning)

53:41.652 --> 53:42.551
- Stop it!

53:48.693 --> 53:52.528
- Seems like you're
employer wanted an upgrade.

53:52.530 --> 53:54.096
Hey, love?

53:54.098 --> 53:56.765
See, you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.903
- Crow, if we don't stop Sebek
from completing the ritual

54:00.905 --> 54:02.471
then we're all dead.

54:06.077 --> 54:07.243
- Not all.

54:07.245 --> 54:08.777
Not all.

54:08.779 --> 54:10.479
See, you don't get it, do you?

54:12.383 --> 54:15.317
You're just a bird
fluttering about.

54:16.721 --> 54:18.354
Fluttering around in your cage.

54:25.963 --> 54:27.162
Get 'em to the truck.

54:38.376 --> 54:42.978
Let's see if you weasel
your way out of this one.

54:42.980 --> 54:45.514
(growling)

54:45.516 --> 54:48.150
(gun blasting)

54:51.689 --> 54:54.023
(growling)

55:01.866 --> 55:04.600
(guns blasting)

55:05.803 --> 55:08.137
(growling)

55:09.407 --> 55:12.608
(mystical tinkling)

55:12.610 --> 55:14.943
(growling)

55:18.249 --> 55:21.383
(creature exploding)

55:35.966 --> 55:39.034
(suspenseful music)

55:54.719 --> 55:58.454
(speaking foreign language)

56:10.534 --> 56:11.867
- Sebek.

56:11.869 --> 56:12.768
Sebek.

56:22.613 --> 56:24.680
(sighs)

56:26.784 --> 56:30.252
- Don't go to America, Vikka?

56:35.092 --> 56:38.093
Don't go to America, Vikka!

56:41.565 --> 56:43.966
Stay here, Vikka.

56:43.968 --> 56:48.604
Learn about the wonders
of the world, Vikka.

56:51.409 --> 56:53.976
Fulfill your destiny, Vikka.

56:56.280 --> 56:57.179
Destiny.

57:01.352 --> 57:02.651
That's strange.

57:10.027 --> 57:10.926
- Sebek.

57:11.862 --> 57:15.264
(speaking foreign language)

57:15.266 --> 57:16.165
- Khufu.

57:17.902 --> 57:18.801
- Sebek!

57:20.304 --> 57:21.203
- Khufu!

57:22.673 --> 57:26.408
(speaking foreign language)

57:31.282 --> 57:32.981
Good, breathe.

57:32.983 --> 57:35.350
Sebek is just an urban legend.

57:35.352 --> 57:39.087
(speaking foreign language)

57:42.693 --> 57:47.129
The tale of the first man
and woman creating you and I.

57:47.131 --> 57:50.866
(speaking foreign language)

57:56.240 --> 57:59.141
(object rattling)

58:03.481 --> 58:05.280
Where did you get this?

58:05.282 --> 58:07.916
- The bedtime
story is real, yes?

58:13.023 --> 58:13.922
- Show me.

58:22.533 --> 58:27.269
(bird cawing)
(panting)

58:35.579 --> 58:39.314
(speaking foreign language)

58:42.119 --> 58:43.018
Run, Khufu.

58:43.888 --> 58:45.487
Take this to the others.

58:49.193 --> 58:52.160
(speaking foreign language)

58:52.162 --> 58:55.230
Let 'em know the
prophecy has begun.

58:57.535 --> 59:00.602
(dramatic groaning)

59:03.240 --> 59:06.141
(somber vocal music)

59:06.143 --> 59:08.977
(birds chirping)

59:25.863 --> 59:26.762
- Stop.

59:28.132 --> 59:29.765
- Is this really necessary?

59:36.874 --> 59:38.640
Some detail you
have there, Sager.

59:41.946 --> 59:45.347
- You know, my
grandfather, had character.

59:47.484 --> 59:48.417
A meticulous man.

59:51.188 --> 59:54.423
(teaspoon clatters)

59:54.425 --> 59:57.392
- Look who I found
snooping around.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.573
- What a beautiful
family picture.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:17.279
I was just explaining
how my grandfather

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:23.352
amassed the riches that
you're privy to today.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.941
(dust smacking)

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.671
(cup and saucer clatter)
(cup and saucer smash)

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:16.238
You see...

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:20.809
without chaos...

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:22.511
(gun cocking)

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:23.412
(gun blasting)

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:27.149
(gasping)
(body thudding)

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:28.350
There can be no order.

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:52.774
You have something
very valuable to me.

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:57.979
- You left us in
that tomb to die.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.482
- Sebek is trying to bring
about the apocalypse.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.552
- The apocalypse?

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:07.089
Do you even know the
meaning of the word?

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:11.693
It means to reveal that
which was once hidden.

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:17.833
You know, my grandfather
was stationed

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:20.769
in Cairo during the war,

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:23.238
somewhere beyond the
outskirts of the city.

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:28.076
Met a traveling man, faceless.

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:32.647
- Is that?

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:38.053
- The Book of Hades,
god of the underworld.

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:43.859
- You keep it here?

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:48.697
What does it say about
the ritual, about Sebek?

01:02:48.699 --> 01:02:49.831
The lost city of Saqqara?

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.566
- I used to stay
up late at night

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:55.036
listening to him speak
of the Stone of Zahad

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:59.141
and the ancient battles
of the pharaohs.

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:02.144
Kings and gods.
(suspenseful music)

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:07.215
He spoke of one taking the
place of two to become all.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.421
- Sager, he came to
the museum yesterday.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:15.524
- [Sager] Sebek?

01:03:15.526 --> 01:03:17.058
- He took the Scarab of Ra.

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:20.729
- The Scarab of Ra?

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:23.465
(dust smacking)

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:32.040
(growling)
(screaming)

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:34.543
(gun blasting)

01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:36.077
- [Daniela] He's
here for the book.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.016
- Go find him!

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.585
(guns blasting)

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:44.853
- We have to protect the book.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:47.856
- It could only go back
to where it all began.

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.758
- [Daniela] What does that mean?

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.127
- You're a smart girl,
you figure it out.

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:00.468
- Watch 'em.

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:10.045
- He's here.

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.113
- Daniela, when this is all over

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:13.748
you and I are gonna have
to have a serious talk.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.818
You've been saying some
really crazy things lately.

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.454
- It could only go back
to where it all began.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:20.722
- What are you talking about?

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.190
- Sager.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.627
He said it could only go
back to where it all began.

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:27.162
- So what?

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:29.431
- So even if he gets the book
we still no where to find him.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:30.866
- And that will somehow
give us more time

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:31.666
to break the curse?

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:32.567
- Yes.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:44.613
- He's still missing
something he needs.

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:46.882
- What is he missing?

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.316
He has the scarab,
he's here for the book.

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:49.551
What else does he need?

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.495
Where'd you get that?

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:06.434
- Sebek gave it to me.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:08.470
- I can't, how?

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:11.206
(guns blasting)

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:17.913
(man screaming)
(mummy growling)

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:19.281
- We have to get out of here.

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:21.249
No one is safe here.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.085
(mummy growling)

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:30.859
Not today, sandman!

01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:32.060
(gun cocking)

01:05:32.062 --> 01:05:33.261
(gun blasting)
(mummy exploding)

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:34.529
- Let's move, the book!

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:41.636
(helicopter propellers whirring)

01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:58.753
- Everything's ready to go.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:04.359
- If you did your job then
we would have the stone!

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:10.832
- Sebek isn't going to the
tomb to resurrect Reheema.

01:06:14.338 --> 01:06:15.370
- What do you mean?

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.173
- He's going to the
tomb to stop her!

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:21.376
- And what would
happen if he does?

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:27.449
- The lost city and everything
inside will be lost forever.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:37.993
(gun blasting)
(groaning)

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:41.696
- These helicopter blades,

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.532
makes it a little
hard of hearing.

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:50.238
Makes me all crazy.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:52.841
Got me all foggy.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:07:00.115
- I didn't see a damn thing.

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:04.953
- We cut them off in
the desert up ahead,

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:07.055
but we do this my way.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:09.891
- But what happens
when we catch 'em?

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.628
- I don't know, be creative.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:19.501
Take the next chopper out,
but take out the trash.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.475
Let's go!

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.411
Immortality awaits!

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:32.247
(mystical music)

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:39.120
(voices growling)

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:41.923
(bird cawing)

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:44.159
(panting)

01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:46.761
- We won't...

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:48.396
- Sager's a maniac.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.033
We have to find Sebek.

01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:55.970
- I think we just did.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:07:59.808
- Stay here.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:01.476
- Stop!

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:07.348
(static whirring)
(groaning)

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.424
(dramatic music)

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:28.269
(muttering in foreign language)

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:37.946
(speaking in foreign language)

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:19.319
(thrilling music)

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:23.491
(dramatic groaning)

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:30.732
Noe!

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:31.633
Noe!

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.975
(mystical tinkling)

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:45.279
(gasping)

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:51.352
- Hey.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:54.556
Did I get him?

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:56.891
- You died.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:01.362
The stone saved you.

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:04.766
- (stammers) I don't understand.

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:09.103
- It doesn't have
any power left.

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:10.371
It doesn't have any
power remaining,

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.073
but I think this is
how Sebek is able

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:13.708
to regenerate his life force.

01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:18.046
- We have to stop Sebek
from completing the ritual.

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:19.447
- Yeah, come on.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:23.618
(helicopter propellers whirring)

01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:37.932
(thrilling music)

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:50.645
(creature growling)

01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:20.608
- [Man] Pull up.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.010
Pull up.

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:22.910
Pull up!

01:11:31.254 --> 01:11:32.887
(crashing)

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:37.058
(helicopter propellers whirring)

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:42.630
(creature roaring)

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.938
(hooves thudding)

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:12.927
(guns blasting)
(creature roaring)

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:42.957
- [Man On Radio] On your back.

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:44.192
Prepare for...

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:48.196
(crashing)

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:50.932
(creature roaring)

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:53.101
(adventurous music)

01:12:53.103 --> 01:12:54.235
- Don't move.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:56.938
- Sager.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.942
We have to stop Sebek from
completing the ritual.

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:04.212
- You just don't get it, do you?

01:13:04.214 --> 01:13:05.847
You are the ritual.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.254
- What are you talking about?

01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:16.057
- The stone was filled
with Sebek's life force.

01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:18.960
Without it...

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:20.695
(gun blasting)

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:23.331
(somber music)

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:33.808
(somber vocal music)

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:40.782
(shouting)

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:45.386
Sebek can't complete the ritual.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:52.193
Sebek is alive.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.264
His power can be
gained by another.

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:05.339
I shall have everlasting power.

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:08.676
(vibrant instrumental music)

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:13.748
(creature growling)
(groaning)

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.317
(crushing)

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.354
- Hold on, Noe.

01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:27.295
Shit.

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:33.801
(mystical tinkling)

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:38.306
(dramatic humming)

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:57.725
(creature roaring)

01:15:00.597 --> 01:15:02.930
(crackling)

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:11.205
(creature screeching)
(creature exploding)

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:18.846
(feet pattering)

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:22.650
- [Man] What do you
want me to do with him?

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:23.518
- Bring him.

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:27.188
He'll be useful
where we're going.

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:49.310
Hello, little friend.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:57.919
(thrilling instrumental music)

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:46.947
