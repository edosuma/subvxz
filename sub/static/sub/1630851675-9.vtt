09:21.528 --> 09:22.444
- Well, yeah.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.812
- I've known you for
a very long time. Yes.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.281
- I mean, I was young
and dumb,

09:26.316 --> 09:28.283
but I had some
tough moments

09:28.318 --> 09:30.035
where, you know,
you cry yourself to sleep,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.936
and you're just, oh, my god,
what I do next?

09:31.955 --> 09:33.955
You know, at some point,
I said to myself

09:33.991 --> 09:37.826
I am never letting a man
make me cry again.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.794
In the past, yeah,
maybe I put up with stuff

09:39.830 --> 09:41.463
that I shouldn't
have put up with.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.214
Now, if this
happened today,

09:43.250 --> 09:45.133
the result is,
I'm breaking up with you.

09:45.168 --> 09:49.087
As I get older, I don't have
patience for bullsh--.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.788

less than what I deserve.

to check in

09:56.063 --> 09:57.795
on one of my girlfriends
because she's, you know,

09:57.814 --> 09:58.963
kind of been
going through a lot

09:58.982 --> 10:00.932
as far as infidelity
is concerned,

10:00.967 --> 10:04.185
but she took it
as me being shady

10:04.237 --> 10:05.537

just checkin' in

10:05.572 --> 10:07.238

my girlfriend was okay.

with friends and with people.

10:09.860 --> 10:10.992
People are human.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.143
- Yes, but I think that's
what friendship is all about.

10:12.162 --> 10:15.113
You gotta talk about the good,
the bad, and the ugly.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.334

27:27.713 --> 27:28.962
not the wedding gown.

27:28.998 --> 27:31.048
- Oh, well, okay.
Let's do it.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.683
[laughing]
let's do it.

27:32.718 --> 27:34.785
- All: Cheers.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.787
- So, I am gonna try on
the first dress.

27:36.806 --> 27:37.971
- Yeah, let's do it.

27:38.007 --> 27:39.256
- All right.
- Whoo-hoo!

27:39.291 --> 27:41.392
- Whoo!
- Not the leg kick.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.959
[laughing]

27:42.978 --> 27:44.144
she's so cute.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.128
- How was your drive?

27:45.147 --> 27:46.230
- It was good.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.315
I haven't seen you since
we went on our girls' trip.

27:48.351 --> 27:49.099
- I know.

27:49.134 --> 27:50.100
It was so good
to get back home.

27:50.135 --> 27:52.319
I was like, I can't--
did something happen?

27:52.355 --> 27:54.321
Like, I felt like
I was hit by a mac truck.

27:54.357 --> 27:56.407
- Well, yeah, girl,
somethin' happened.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.974
Are you kidding me?
[laughing]

27:57.993 --> 28:01.695
I feel like what happened
in williamsburg

28:01.747 --> 28:03.580
is definitely not fair.

28:03.616 --> 28:05.833
You don't talk about
people's husbands

28:05.868 --> 28:07.317
behind each other's backs.

28:07.336 --> 28:08.985
Gizelle should have
definitely brought this

28:09.004 --> 28:11.689
straight to wendy.

28:11.724 --> 28:12.489
- Are you ready?

28:12.508 --> 28:14.208
- Yes, I see.
- Ahh, let me see.

28:15.761 --> 28:16.627
- The first look.

28:16.662 --> 28:20.197
- Aww, I like that, karen.
- Oh, cute.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.832
- What do you think
this does for ray?

28:22.885 --> 28:24.000
- It's hot.
- A lot

28:24.019 --> 28:25.352
'cause it does
a lot for me, honey.

28:25.388 --> 28:27.671
- I need the second dress
to be easy to dance in,

28:27.690 --> 28:30.524
so I can boogie,
easy to slip in and out of,

28:30.559 --> 28:33.310
uh, when we go to
the anniversary suite.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.145
- Okay.
- Yes, the color is perfect.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.012
- Yes.
- All right.

28:36.031 --> 28:36.864
So, dress number one,
y'all like it.

28:36.899 --> 28:38.198
- Yes, I like it.
- It's beautiful.

28:38.234 --> 28:39.116
- I like it.
- Hold on.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.350
- Do a full twirl for me.

28:40.369 --> 28:41.685
Okay.

28:41.704 --> 28:42.569
- Ooh, as I exit.

28:42.621 --> 28:43.687
- See, that's pretty.
- That's right.

28:43.706 --> 28:44.855
That's how we do it.

28:44.890 --> 28:45.889
- I think it's gonna
be super nice,

28:45.925 --> 28:47.658
especially in this area.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.025
- Wait. Is it here?

28:49.044 --> 28:50.043
- Yeah.

28:50.079 --> 28:52.045
This is the venue.
- Stop.

28:52.081 --> 28:54.214
Oh, okay.
- This is it.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.566
This is the venue
for 40 people.

28:55.601 --> 28:59.052
- Um, the interior of
the space is perfect.

28:59.088 --> 29:00.604
- Uh-uh, mia,
not interior.

29:00.639 --> 29:01.472
[laughing]

29:01.507 --> 29:04.040
- we might have
to get some type of

29:04.059 --> 29:05.809
runners for outside.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.011
Yeah.
[laughing]

29:08.047 --> 29:09.897
- okay, ladies.

29:09.932 --> 29:11.899
- Aww.
- Wow.

29:11.934 --> 29:13.600
Um, can ya move?
- Of course.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.819
I like the sleeves.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.272
- Oh, wow.
I don't know.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.189
- I don't know about
that with the dress.

29:19.224 --> 29:20.741
- I think-- okay.
- I don't know, karen.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.094
- I don't know about that.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.579
- Girl, can you sit down?

29:25.614 --> 29:26.697
- Let's try.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.899
- You got it?

29:28.934 --> 29:30.617
- That's a no.

29:30.669 --> 29:31.752
[laughing]
- wait.

29:31.787 --> 29:33.137
- Whew.
All right, girls.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.505
You know what?
I'm gonna lean.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.289
- Okay, lean.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.341
- I'm just so glad
about being here

29:37.376 --> 29:39.092
and doing this
with you girls.

29:39.128 --> 29:40.260
I'm like--
- as you should.

29:40.296 --> 29:41.645
I'm so excited for you.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.213
- We were just talking about it
'cause we hadn't seen each other

29:43.249 --> 29:44.598
since williamsburg.
- Since williamsburg.

29:44.633 --> 29:47.584
- But I thought overall,
it was very revealing.

29:47.603 --> 29:49.136
- Hmm.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.688
- Speaking of,
so, I got an invite

29:51.724 --> 29:55.893
to drinks tonight
for robyn's birthday,

29:55.928 --> 29:58.395
um, and I noticed
that you two

29:58.430 --> 29:59.696
weren't on the invite.

30:01.317 --> 30:03.484
Gizelle sent the message.

30:06.872 --> 30:10.290
- Um, listen, it is
happy birthday, robyn dixon.

30:10.326 --> 30:12.743
I want everyone here
that really loves robyn,

30:12.778 --> 30:15.629
supports her and
wished her a happy birthday.

30:15.664 --> 30:17.548
Karen didn't and
neither did wendy.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.417
So, yeah,
y'all hos ain't invited.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.285
- Gizelle and I have not seen
each other since williamsburg.

30:22.304 --> 30:23.387
- Right.
So, this is--

30:23.422 --> 30:24.221
- so, I wouldn't expect her
to extend an invitation.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.807
- Uh-uh.
But it's not about gizelle.

30:26.842 --> 30:30.928
It's not her birthday.
It's robyn's birthday.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.312
- To be honest with you, I, too,

30:32.348 --> 30:33.964
have my challenges
with gizelle.

30:33.983 --> 30:35.265
You know that.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.568
However, do you kick
a wounded dog?

30:37.603 --> 30:38.635
No, you don't.

30:38.654 --> 30:40.821
- But-but that wounded dog
also shouldn't kick you.

30:40.856 --> 30:42.990
- Loneliness and bitterness
makes you do crazy things.

30:43.025 --> 30:43.991
She really, in her mind,

30:44.026 --> 30:45.492
thought she was
in a relationship.

30:45.528 --> 30:48.011
And if she would just say
she's hurting,

30:48.047 --> 30:49.580
she would get
the support she needed,

30:49.615 --> 30:50.781
even from me.

30:50.816 --> 30:53.784
There is some pain
and shame she's dealing.

30:53.819 --> 30:54.701
- Yes.

30:54.753 --> 30:56.203
- And because of the type
of person I am,

30:56.255 --> 30:57.754
I send this message
to her through you.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.990
- Okay.

31:00.009 --> 31:02.526
- I know she has challenges
with saying she's sorry.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.011
I want one thing.
- Okay.

31:04.046 --> 31:04.845
- I want her to text and say,

31:04.880 --> 31:06.880
"I regret using
the word 'death,'"

31:06.932 --> 31:08.999
and we are good.

31:09.018 --> 31:11.602
If she can muster up an apology,
I, for the sake of

31:11.637 --> 31:13.837
the women in this group,
will accept that

31:13.856 --> 31:15.389
and try and move on.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.940
Please let her know
I'm comfortable with

31:16.976 --> 31:18.892
having her do that.
- Okay.

31:18.944 --> 31:22.613
Girl, I feel like
I'm right down in the middle.

31:23.449 --> 31:24.648
- Coming up next...

31:24.683 --> 31:26.533
- Can I have my allowance
this week?

31:26.569 --> 31:28.018
I'm sorry.
I-I don't have a job anymore

31:28.037 --> 31:30.354
'cause I just wait on you
hand and foot.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.689
Find somebody else
to do that sh-- for free.

31:32.708 --> 31:37.027
♪♪

31:38.463 --> 31:45.352
♪♪

31:45.404 --> 31:47.537
let me come and get you,
so you don't blow away.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.538
It's windy.
- Yes, baby.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.540
Ahh!

31:50.576 --> 31:52.542
Oh, my god.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.528
- Hi. How are you?

31:54.580 --> 31:57.197
- Oh, this is cute.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.365
- You can scan here
for your menu.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.651
- Oh, great. Thank you.
- Oh, okay, perfect, the menu.

32:01.670 --> 32:05.155
- Okay, they have mac and cheese
and lamb chops.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.957
- Delicious.
- They have lemon pepper wings.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.326
- Sounds like a winner for me.

32:09.345 --> 32:10.210
Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.013
- You're welcome.
So, did you guys decide?

32:13.048 --> 32:16.350
- I will try the lamb chops.

32:16.385 --> 32:18.552
Let me do the mac and cheese.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.187
- I'll do a crab cake sandwich
with fries.

32:20.222 --> 32:21.838
- Okay.
- Some lemon pepper wings--

32:21.857 --> 32:23.340
is it possible
to get all flats?

32:23.359 --> 32:25.242
- Sure, for you. Ha!
- Thank you.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.109
- All right, comin' up.
- Appreciate it.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.694
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

32:27.730 --> 32:28.695
[laughing]

32:28.731 --> 32:30.280
- who is calling me?
- This is a nice place.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.649
- We're out of the house.
- Yeah.

32:32.685 --> 32:36.353
- I'm literally going
right into music video week,

32:36.372 --> 32:38.855
and I'm feeling
all of the pressure

32:38.874 --> 32:41.024
that's on just me.

32:41.043 --> 32:44.244
It's like boot camp
for black girls, honey.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.712
- Let's do
the same from the top.

32:45.748 --> 32:49.699
♪♪

32:49.718 --> 32:53.220
- I can't do that.
[sighs]

32:53.255 --> 32:56.423
and there's so much
riding on this.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.226
We've commissioned
so many people.

32:59.261 --> 33:00.927
We've spent so much money.

33:00.980 --> 33:05.015
I have to get it right,
and that's a lot of pressure.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.100
- We're lookin' pretty good
for the music video.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.987
- Right.
Like, you know everything

33:10.022 --> 33:11.955
that's happening
in the schedule.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.023
- Yeah.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.558
Wednesday, you'll be
rehearsing for "drive back,"

33:15.577 --> 33:17.411
and then we're really shooting
"drive back" backwards.

33:17.446 --> 33:19.079
So, it's gonna be a busy week,

33:19.114 --> 33:20.931
and then I've got
a couple of cooking classes

33:20.966 --> 33:24.234
next week, as well.

33:24.269 --> 33:27.621
- Well, what's gonna happen
if something goes wrong,

33:27.673 --> 33:28.755
and you're not there?

33:28.791 --> 33:31.008
- Well, that's why
you have ej,

33:31.043 --> 33:32.626
the choreographer.
He's gonna know.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.212
Chastity, the director,
she's gonna know.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.296
They all know what's going on.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.115
They're all gonna get
call sheets and everything,

33:38.150 --> 33:39.266
including you.
I don't--

33:39.301 --> 33:44.471
- like, but why are you having
to work during this time?

33:44.523 --> 33:47.524
- 'cause that's
when I was booked.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.428
- The last thing I need,
is to be feeling like

33:51.463 --> 33:54.147
I can't be the artist
because I don't know

33:54.199 --> 33:55.432
if everything is in place
because--

33:55.451 --> 33:56.366
- so, you don't--
you don't trust me

33:56.402 --> 33:59.152
to have everything else
in place for you?

33:59.204 --> 34:00.203
- You're not gonna be there.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.438
- But you keep puttin'
your nose in everything

34:01.457 --> 34:03.490
and don't trust me to handle it
and make sure it's done.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.625
- No, I'm not putting
my nose in it.

34:05.661 --> 34:09.162
My mind is, like, whizzing,
thinking about all the things

34:09.214 --> 34:10.280
that could be
falling through the cracks.

34:10.299 --> 34:14.751
And once again, chris is not
available to support me.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.057
- I'm, like, trying not to
be stressed about this.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.726
You are missed here,
husbandger.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.480
- Husbandger couldn't be here.

34:26.515 --> 34:27.597
- I'm surprised.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.516
He didn't show up to
that studio just one session.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.635
- If something is messed up,
it's my career.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.137
It's my reputation.

34:34.173 --> 34:38.358
It all falls on me.
It's me and jesus.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.944
You're telling me
that you're not gonna be

34:40.979 --> 34:42.662
at several of these scenes.
Like--

34:42.698 --> 34:44.331
- I'm not gonna be
at two of them, just two.

34:44.366 --> 34:45.582
- That's a lot.
That's Thursday.

34:45.617 --> 34:48.251
That's, like,
the biggest scene.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.953
- It's-it's not a problem.
- I'm not making it a problem.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.988
- I volunteered
to do this sh--.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.206
What do you want me to do?

34:53.258 --> 34:55.459
Just drop everything
that I'm doing

34:55.494 --> 34:58.295
and do nothing but sit here
and make sure that you're okay?

34:58.330 --> 35:01.014
Then I can ask you
for an allowance.

35:01.049 --> 35:02.349
I'm sorry.
I-I don't have a job anymore

35:02.384 --> 35:04.167
'cause I just wait on you
hand and foot.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.769
- I need you
to really figure out

35:05.804 --> 35:08.838
what your attitude is.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.607
- That being said,

35:10.642 --> 35:13.393
I'm gonna play golf
this afternoon.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.411
- You always go play
----ing golf

35:14.446 --> 35:16.279
when I need you to be present
to do the sh--

35:16.315 --> 35:17.280
that I need to do
for this video.

35:17.316 --> 35:20.117
- Between managing you
and all of your sh--,

35:20.152 --> 35:22.319
