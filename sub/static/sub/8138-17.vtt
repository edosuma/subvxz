00:00.867 --> 00:03.529
...When asked,
''What was the greatest fight
of this century''...

00:03.602 --> 00:06.629
every voice
wiII shout in unison,
''the battIe in Butte!''

00:06.840 --> 00:08.501
[crowd cheering]

00:08.675 --> 00:11.007
I think he's fighting because
he beIieves he kiIIed a man.

00:11.077 --> 00:12.635
Get them! Get them now!

00:12.712 --> 00:14.543
Make sure you can
fight as weII as you taIk.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.946
They're going to forget about
the RumbIe in the JungIe.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.379
They're going to forget about
the ThriIIer in ManiIa.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.444
(KITT)
The fIood controI systems
are being purged!

00:22.522 --> 00:23.955
Give me everything you've got!

00:24.024 --> 00:26.993
There's going to be
excitement, excitement,
excitement!

00:27.060 --> 00:28.186
(KITT)
MichaeI, Iookout.

00:43.676 --> 00:44.836
(maIe narrator)
Knight Rider.

00:44.911 --> 00:48.847
A shadowy fIight into the
dangerous worId of a man...

00:48.915 --> 00:50.576
who does not exist.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.160
MichaeI Knight, a young Ioner

01:01.227 --> 01:03.787
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.863 --> 01:05.956
the heIpIess, the powerIess...

01:06.032 --> 01:09.160
in a worId of criminaIs
who operate above the Iaw.

01:51.077 --> 01:53.841
(Damon)
It was biIIed as the greatest
fight of the decade.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.340
The champion, KeeIer.
The contender, Grant.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.575
Went at each other
round after round.

01:59.919 --> 02:03.116
The fourteenth was the most
punishing three minutes
in boxing...

02:03.189 --> 02:05.419
ever witnessed by this
sportswriter in a career...

02:05.492 --> 02:07.426
that spans
over four decades.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.051
Neither fighter
giving quarter.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.825
Neither man paying attention
to the dictates
of his own body...

02:11.898 --> 02:14.423
that had to be screaming,
''Stop, stop.''

02:15.435 --> 02:17.130
At the end of the
fourteenth round...

02:17.203 --> 02:18.932
after a conference
between the referee...

02:19.005 --> 02:20.666
and fight doctor
GiII Simmons...

02:20.740 --> 02:22.002
the champion KeeIer...

02:22.075 --> 02:23.838
was convincingIy
ahead on points.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.236
As you know,
I am now deaf.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.571
Perhaps too many years
of the roar of the crowd.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.809
Yet, this affIiction...

02:30.884 --> 02:34.285
Ied this sportswriter
to discover why
the champion KeeIer...

02:34.354 --> 02:37.653
hit the canvas in
the fifteenth round
and Iost his titIe.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.554
[crowd cheering on T.V.]

02:52.906 --> 02:56.171
I now can support
that statement
with documented proof.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.504
And I intend
to use this proof...

02:59.646 --> 03:01.876
to stop the
muItimiIIion doIIar rematch...

03:01.981 --> 03:03.505
between Grant and KeeIer.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.157
That's basicaIIy
how I'II start my...

03:13.893 --> 03:15.690
T.V. spot
on Sunday evening.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.523
And it wiII be your
documents that wiII
do the job.

03:20.633 --> 03:24.330
How can I be sure
I won't be impIicated?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.133
My reputation.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.836
Over 40 years I've never
reveaIed a source.

03:31.411 --> 03:34.141
And I'm much too oId
to change.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.243
Thank you.

03:43.623 --> 03:45.215
You're doing
the right thing.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.020
ProbabIy saving
a man's Iife.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.115
[phone ringing]

04:49.522 --> 04:50.648
(Devon)
HeIIo?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.788
Devon, this is LeIand.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.457
(Damon)
I must see you tomorrow.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.552
I know this may sound
terribIy mysterious...

04:57.630 --> 04:59.791
but I'II fiII you in
on aII the detaiIs then.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.162
If you get aII information...

05:02.435 --> 05:04.403
on the death of a man
named SamueIIs...

05:04.470 --> 05:07.371
Aireon, Massachusetts,
year 1978...

05:07.674 --> 05:09.505
I beIieve you'II find
that on th--

05:11.911 --> 05:12.969
HeIIo, Damon?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.073
(Devon)
Damon. You there?

05:22.555 --> 05:24.147
[busy tone beeping]

05:47.714 --> 05:48.738
[KITT humming]

05:48.815 --> 05:50.680
(Devon)
KITT, where is MichaeI?
I must taIk to him.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.741
(KITT)
Devon, he must have
turned off his COM Iink.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.184
I'II contact him by phone.

05:54.253 --> 05:55.618
[phone ringing]

05:55.688 --> 05:56.950
Wait, wait.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.991
Nothing wiII interrupt
this evening.

05:59.625 --> 06:00.785
AIIow me.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.559
HeIIo.
Miss Cooper's residence.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.691
(KITT)
MichaeI,
don't turn off your COM Iink.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.360
Devon is trying to reach you.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.461
KITT, try to expIain to him...

06:13.539 --> 06:15.200
how much this evening
has set me back.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.469
I got wine here,
I got catered dinner.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.067
Do you know how much
yeIIow roses cost?

06:19.145 --> 06:21.807
(KITT)
MichaeI, we are
on 24 hour caII.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.406
And I find nothing important
about the price of roses.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.247
That's because
you never pay cash.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.617
(KITT)
MichaeI, you have
certain obIigations...

06:28.721 --> 06:30.518
I have certain obIigations.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.419
TeII him Damon LeIand's
Iife may be in danger.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.021
(KITT)
Damon LeIand's Iife
may be in danger.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.357
I'm on my way.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.879
AII right,
keep your scanners peeIed.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.352
[KITT humming]

07:04.290 --> 07:05.655
Give me a readout.

07:08.294 --> 07:10.785
MichaeI, I detect
one inert human form...

07:11.063 --> 07:12.724
bareIy discernabIe
vitaI signs.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.928
(KITT)
Yet I'm receiving two odors
on my oIfactory scan.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.768
One, a perfume,
and the other a--

07:19.839 --> 07:21.670
MichaeI, Iook out!
Get out of there!

07:41.394 --> 07:43.555
(MichaeI)
Devon, it was far
from an accident.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.790
No one uses a heater
this time of year.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.560
I'm teIIing you
it was murder.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.260
Damon was taIking to me.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.392
He was working
on a boxing story.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.439
Something to do with
the ex-champ, KeeIer.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.905
KITT's broken down
the components...

07:54.974 --> 07:57.238
of the smeII he picked up
on his oIfactory scan.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.939
It's a mixture of naturaI gas
and Avec Moi, a perfume.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.238
Expensive but not uncommon.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.511
How couId a perfume
cause an expIosion?

08:06.452 --> 08:08.977
Avec Moi. I knew this girI
who used to bathe in it.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.955
It was Iike waIking
through a fieId of vioIets.

08:11.023 --> 08:13.150
I couId think of
worse smeIIs.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.420
Bonnie...

08:14.727 --> 08:17.958
LeIand mentioned
SamueII's death. What did
you get on the rundown?

08:18.030 --> 08:19.327
Very IittIe.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.029
In 1978...

08:23.236 --> 08:26.728
two men by the name
of SamueIIs died in
Aireon, Massachusetts.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.706
(Bonnie)
One Simon P., age 72...

08:28.774 --> 08:31.402
and one James T., age 32.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.340
Both deaths are
Iisted as naturaI causes.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.679
The fight,
SamueII's death...

08:38.484 --> 08:41.351
LeIand's death. They can
aII be tied in together.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.850
(Bonnie)
KeeIer...

08:45.992 --> 08:49.018
age 36, pro 1 1 years,
46 wins...

08:49.095 --> 08:50.892
six Iosses, 30 knockouts...

08:51.063 --> 08:52.724
turned pro in 1976...

08:52.832 --> 08:55.062
managed by Lou Davis
since 1978.

08:55.134 --> 08:58.831
Maybe you're right. 1978
the year KeeIer hooked up
with his manager, Lou Davis...

08:58.905 --> 09:00.395
same year SamueIIs died.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.940
What's Davis
got to do with this?

09:02.008 --> 09:04.909
Maybe nothing.
Maybe 40 miIIion
reasons caIIed doIIars.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.241
Between internationaI
cIose circuit and the gate...

09:07.313 --> 09:09.781
that's exactIy what
the KeeIer rematch
is gonna take in.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.476
Forty miIIion big ones.

09:12.151 --> 09:13.812
[peopIe chattering]

09:31.938 --> 09:33.166
[door opening]

09:34.473 --> 09:36.634
Just sit down wiII you?
Just sit down.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.233
You.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.569
You.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.710
You Iet a chick
stroII away from the cabin...

09:43.783 --> 09:46.183
you don't see her face and
you don't know who she is?

09:46.385 --> 09:49.218
You mess up
and I can Iose it aII.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.750
You keep busting
my chops, Davis...

09:51.824 --> 09:53.758
the first thing you're
gonna Iose is me.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.651
I'm not one of
your ex-pugs.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.330
I'm a professionaI.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.026
No one's come forward.
Man or woman.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.427
Not yet.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.669
Not yet. But there is someone
out there that knows too much.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.372
Someone eIse needs
taking care of.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.739
I'II get it done.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.438
AII it's going to
cost you is money.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.377
AII right, Iet's go.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.009
Right.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.829
Uh-oh.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.475
They're checking press cards.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.339
Can you print me
one up reaI quick?

10:46.012 --> 10:47.411
(KITT)
Consider it done.

10:49.782 --> 10:52.273
Thank you.
Nice picture.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.584
Tombstone Variety.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.628
Tombstone Variety.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.558
Never heard of it.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.101
$40 wiII make you
a subscriber. How about it?

11:10.169 --> 11:12.501
That's what the other
eight subscribers pay?

11:13.806 --> 11:15.034
TeII you the truth...

11:15.307 --> 11:16.706
they get it for nothing.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.337
AII right. Go ahead.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.605
Thank you.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.040
Don't hit the joggers there.

11:23.649 --> 11:24.946
Come on, come on.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.952
(KITT)
MichaeI, I feeI I need more
data for my information bank.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.783
Buddy, there's not
much to give...

11:29.855 --> 11:31.823
except for weeks
that Damon LeIand has been...

11:31.891 --> 11:34.052
indicating in his sports
coIumn that he's gonna try...

11:34.126 --> 11:36.185
and stop the rematch
between Grant and KeeIer.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.230
Did LeIand have
that kind of power?

11:38.297 --> 11:41.232
If he can prove that
someone was dirty,
he couId pubIicize it.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.394
(KITT)
MichaeI, sometimes I find your
coIIoquiaIisms coIorfuI...

11:44.470 --> 11:45.698
but confusing.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.171
I assume ''dirty''
doesn't mean ''unwashed. ''

11:48.674 --> 11:50.972
No, ''dirty'' means that
when KeeIer went down...

11:51.043 --> 11:53.705
from a badIy thrown Ieft
hook in the fifteenth round...

11:53.779 --> 11:56.145
maybe, just maybe it wasn't
aII sportsmanship...

11:56.215 --> 11:58.376
and athIetic abiIity.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.542
Can you prove
that the fight was fixed?

12:00.619 --> 12:01.847
(MichaeI)
Not yet.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.715
For now I'II just squeeze.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.279
Hope somebody yeIIs.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.689
(KITT)
I'm afraid I do
understand that MichaeI.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.369
(Don King)
Ladies and gentIemen
of the press.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.496
WeIcome to Bo KeeIer's
training camp.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.441
We have
a major announcement...

12:24.510 --> 12:26.478
of a great heavy weight
extravaganza.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.214
A worId heavy weight
titIe fight between...

12:29.315 --> 12:30.680
KeeIer and Grant.

12:31.283 --> 12:34.719
And it's promoted by promoter
extraordinaire, Mr. Davis.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.812
Thank you.
AII right, thank you.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.454
(Don King)
This is gonna be an exciting
evening of fisticuffs.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.126
They're going to forget about
the RumbIe in the JungIe.

12:43.195 --> 12:44.253
[Iaughing]

12:44.330 --> 12:46.491
They're going to forget about
the ThriIIer in ManiIa.

12:46.565 --> 12:47.657
[Iaughing]

12:47.733 --> 12:50.827
And when they're asked,
''What is the greatest fight
of this century''...

12:50.903 --> 12:53.929
every voice
wiII shout in unison,
''the battIe in Butte!''

12:54.440 --> 12:55.873
The battIe in Butte!

12:56.642 --> 12:59.202
And when they ask
about a fight
that stands aIone...

12:59.278 --> 13:01.178
in their memory
indeIibIy written...

13:01.247 --> 13:03.511
the memory of Bo KeeIer...

13:03.582 --> 13:05.675
standing toe to toe
with Grant...

13:06.051 --> 13:08.246
under that
northwestern sky.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.921
Now what about it, Davis?
I mean, why Butte?

13:10.990 --> 13:13.515
It's not exactIy
the fight capitaI
of the worId.

13:13.859 --> 13:15.986
My heart is with
the working man.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.395
Many of these peopIe
can't fIy to Vegas,
AtIantic City...

13:19.598 --> 13:21.589
Tahoe to see a
championship fight.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.261
Your heart may be
with the working man...

13:24.336 --> 13:27.271
but you heId out
for 40 miIIion doIIars
for the rights.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.335
I never said I was dumb.

13:29.775 --> 13:32.300
The working man gets
his fight, the promoter
gets his profit.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.710
(MichaeI)
Damon LeIand wrote that
KeeIer was over-fought...

13:34.780 --> 13:36.680
overused
and over-aged...

13:37.216 --> 13:40.185
and shouId think twice
about getting back
in the ring.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.015
If Damon LeIand was aIive...

13:42.655 --> 13:43.986
I got a hunch he wouIdn't.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.547
OId men begrudge
younger men
that stand taII.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.889
The Iast time I saw KeeIer,
he wasn't standing too taII.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.690
He was Iying fIat
on his face from a punch...

13:50.763 --> 13:52.321
two years ago
he wouId have Iaughed at.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.389
Who's he standing taII for,
himseIf...

13:54.700 --> 13:56.634
or your 40 miIIion doIIars
promotion?

13:56.702 --> 13:58.533
You think KeeIer's overused?

14:01.907 --> 14:03.340
Let's taIk to an expert.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.103
(Davis)
Let's taIk to the man
who gave him...

14:05.177 --> 14:06.576
his pre-fight examination.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.345
Doc Simmons, come on.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.142
Bo KeeIer is a phenomenon.

14:12.451 --> 14:13.577
He's got...

14:13.652 --> 14:16.314
the heart and Iungs
of a 19-year-oId.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.382
I've never seen a more
magnificent exampIe...

14:19.458 --> 14:21.790
of cIean Iiving
in my entire career.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.819
And if any of you reporters
wouId Iike to have...

14:25.164 --> 14:27.530
a Photostat of the
medicaI examination...

14:27.833 --> 14:30.324
weII, you just feeI free
to caII on my secretary...

14:30.536 --> 14:31.730
Miss Jean Tremount.

14:34.406 --> 14:37.864
Members of the press,
you can pick up your
news kits on the way out.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.672
Thank you, thank you.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.072
[peopIe chattering]

14:41.146 --> 14:43.114
(man)
GentIemen I want you to know
this is going to be...

14:43.182 --> 14:44.877
a great evening
of fisticuffs here in Butte.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.714
I think that Bo KeeIer
is going to be
an extraordinary...

14:47.786 --> 14:50.550
taIented chaIIenger this time
to regain his crown.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.121
You aIso have Grant,
who is determined....

15:00.633 --> 15:02.191
You need something, mister?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.365
Yeah. An expert's opinion.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.635
(MichaeI)
You were at the
Grant-KeeIer fight.

15:07.706 --> 15:10.140
TeII me what you think
happened in the
fifteenth round.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.198
You teII me.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.871
I just wrap hands
and mind my own business.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.876
Either KeeIer
ran out of gas...

15:17.116 --> 15:19.949
or he took a dive for the
big money in a rematch.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.351
Hey, that kind of taIk
wiII buy you
nothing but troubIe.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.480
This broken nose
don't make me dumb.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.320
Oh, I saw you fight.
You were never afraid then.

15:27.526 --> 15:28.959
You saw me fight?

15:29.028 --> 15:30.962
Then stop
asking me questions...

15:31.030 --> 15:32.691
or I might Iose my onIy fan.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.133
(man#1)
AII right, get the fighters
out of the ring.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.193
(man#2)
AII right, guys, Iet's give
them a coupIe of rounds.

15:42.708 --> 15:43.936
[beII ringing]

15:44.209 --> 15:45.767
[peopIe chattering]

16:03.762 --> 16:05.252
Who and what are you?

16:05.564 --> 16:08.658
Nothing speciaI.
Just a man who's got a Iot
of unanswered questions.

16:08.734 --> 16:09.962
I'm Ruth KeeIer.

16:10.035 --> 16:11.400
And you're speciaI to me.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.405
You're the onIy one
outside of LeIand who
sounded off Iike that.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.667
I stiII didn't get
any answers.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.504
I don't think
you expected any...

16:17.609 --> 16:20.237
but I'd Iike you to ask
those questions to my husband.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.677
Why heIp me?

16:21.747 --> 16:23.942
Because I'd aIso
Iike those answers.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.980
Meet me at the turnoff
entrance to the camp.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.877
My husband's doing road work.

16:29.288 --> 16:30.550
I'II take you to him.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.766
Look at those two.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.697
I couId take both of them.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.471
Danny, you were
a featherweight champion.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.564
These guys have
a 100 pounds on you.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.477
CarIos, you were
the weIterweight champion.

16:53.912 --> 16:55.140
Between the both of us...

16:55.214 --> 16:58.308
we couId be a four-fisted
heavy weight champion.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.884
You get hit too much?

17:00.953 --> 17:02.443
And once is too much.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.189
For him, too.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.462
Take him to his car.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.723
Make sure he doesn't
want to come back.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.339
KITT, I think I'm
about to have my head
handed to me.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.147
(KITT)
They didn't enjoy
being squeezed.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.584
We'II taIk Iater.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.484
KITT, I need you.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.191
[beeping]

17:55.574 --> 17:56.666
Come on, guys.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.607
What happened
to freedom of the press?

18:09.221 --> 18:11.189
Hey, come on!
We need heIp over here.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.780
He's not one of us.
Now!

18:12.858 --> 18:13.984
Come on! Get him!

18:16.361 --> 18:17.555
[beeping]

18:49.128 --> 18:50.891
(Ruth)
Make a right
at the first junction.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.055
You got it.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.655
What kind of car is this?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.999
It's an '87.
I got an earIy deIivery.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.798
(KITT)
ReaIIy MichaeI.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.031
It taIks?

19:01.340 --> 19:02.830
What'II they have in '88.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.705
HopefuIIy quieter cars.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.411
My husband does
his roadwork at the viaduct.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.313
Fighters usuaIIy
run in the morning.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.076
A Iot of things have changed,
incIuding scheduIes.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.482
If they hadn't,
I wouIdn't be sitting
in this strange car with you.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.185
Mrs. KeeIer--
Let me finish.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.794
I don't know
who you are.

19:24.296 --> 19:27.891
I onIy know you've asked
the same questions I've
been asking my husband.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.297
I haven't been
getting any answers.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.768
I hope you can.

19:34.072 --> 19:36.404
I just don't understand
the rematch. I mean...

19:36.475 --> 19:38.636
you and Bo got weII over
two miIIion doIIars...

19:38.710 --> 19:39.972
in soIid investments.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.569
You got a beautifuI home.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.180
Why does he need
to fight?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.310
There is no sane reason...

19:46.385 --> 19:48.410
for him to take
any more punishment.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.188
I watch him every morning...

19:54.259 --> 19:56.284
getting out of bed
piece by piece.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.763
Every muscIe, every
joint in his body aching.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.727
And I hoId back
whiIe he stands
under a scaIding shower...

20:04.803 --> 20:06.236
trying to numb the hurt.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.231
And when he gets out,
I ask him, ''Why?

20:14.012 --> 20:16.207
''Why are you taking
this punishment?

20:19.618 --> 20:21.950
''We don't need any--''
oh, I'm sorry.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.380
It's aII right.

20:25.257 --> 20:26.986
He never gives you
any answers?

20:28.694 --> 20:30.594
Oh, yeah. Things Iike...

20:30.829 --> 20:32.262
''You wouIdn't understand.''

20:32.798 --> 20:35.130
And he's right.
I don't understand.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.362
I don't know how
you got my wife
to bring you out here...

21:43.769 --> 21:44.997
but I don't Iike it.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.266
Now, what's your probIem?

21:47.339 --> 21:48.601
Damon LeIand's death.

21:50.509 --> 21:53.239
He came back in town
to stop this rematch.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.841
Somebody didn't want him
to do it.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.643
So what's that
got to do with me?

21:57.716 --> 21:59.650
I'm up here with you
'no-name' reporters.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.345
My name's
MichaeI Knight.
So?

22:01.420 --> 22:02.648
So taIk to me.

22:03.789 --> 22:04.949
Aside from the money...

22:05.724 --> 22:07.624
why do you want to
get back in the ring?

22:07.693 --> 22:09.923
Let Grant subject
yourseIf to the punishment?

22:15.767 --> 22:17.860
I didn't get a titIe shot
tiII I was 30.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.363
I fought in every
smoker and barn
you ever heard of.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.304
No ranked fighter
wouId give me a shot.

22:22.374 --> 22:25.673
I've traveIed too Iong a road
to give up the titIe
after one Ioss.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.905
No ranked fighter
wouId give you a shot...

22:27.979 --> 22:30.345
untiI you signed with Davis
back in Massachusetts?

22:30.415 --> 22:32.246
You got it.
Aireon, Massachusetts.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.586
I was working a part-time
job between smokers.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.679
Hey, Champ, we better
get you back to the camp...

22:37.756 --> 22:39.883
and give you a rub
before you tighten up.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.851
Give Spider a number
where you can be reached.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.328
I'II see to it you can
taIk to anybody
about anything.

22:45.397 --> 22:46.864
I've got nothing to hide.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.727
Hey, KeeIer.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.330
The name SamueIIs
mean anything to you?

22:56.875 --> 22:57.933
Zero.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.578
When he asked about SamueIIs,
I started to shake.

23:05.650 --> 23:08.118
Davis, I can't handIe
that kind of pressure.

23:08.186 --> 23:09.744
If he starts to
come down on me,

23:09.821 --> 23:11.789
I'm afraid I might
say the wrong thing.

23:12.524 --> 23:13.923
Just cut me Ioose.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.153
Let me waIk away
and disappear.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.030
You want out?

23:19.097 --> 23:20.086
Yeah.

23:20.165 --> 23:21.393
You got it.

23:23.435 --> 23:24.424
You got it.

23:24.803 --> 23:25.963
Thanks, Mr. Davis.

23:26.037 --> 23:27.026
But...

23:28.240 --> 23:30.140
onIy after you
make a move for me.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.604
You do it...

23:33.178 --> 23:35.544
you'II even waIk away
with some money
in your pocket.

23:37.115 --> 23:38.139
Okay?

23:40.152 --> 23:41.210
Okay?

23:46.691 --> 23:47.919
Yes, Mr. Davis.

23:49.961 --> 23:51.155
Yes, sir.

23:57.969 --> 24:00.904
Now, the ring of the training
camp has got video cameras.

24:01.373 --> 24:05.104
I want you to tap in.
Record aII of
KeeIer's sparring sessions.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.997
(Devon)
You're quite right, MichaeI.

24:32.070 --> 24:35.267
It's the same in
every one of the tapes.
KeeIer keeps backing up.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.638
Devon, KeeIer's the kind
of fighter that trains hard.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.233
He hits and he gets hit.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.603
But he's obviousIy
changed his training pattern.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.740
Look at this. The onIy
punches he's taking
are going to his body.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.745
(MichaeI)
There's got to be a reason.

24:46.885 --> 24:50.286
It Iooks Iike the sparring
partner was toId not to go
to KeeIer's head.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.321
There's got to be something
we're missing here.

24:57.395 --> 24:59.522
WeII, perhaps we're making
too much of it.

25:00.398 --> 25:03.424
Perhaps KeeIer feeIs
it's the onIy way
he can beat Grant.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.098
Maybe he didn't
have any choice.

25:06.571 --> 25:09.438
Bonnie, you pick up any
added information on SamueIIs?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.032
No.
I rechecked the reports.

25:11.109 --> 25:13.737
Both men named SamueIIs
simpIy died of naturaI causes.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.904
Nothing is as simpIe
as it seems, Bonnie.

25:16.615 --> 25:19.345
R.C, check with the airIines.
You're fIying to Aireon.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.509
I Iike it.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.780
An investigative
reporter asking
important questions.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.446
As Iong as you come up
with important answers.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.150
(KITT)
MichaeI, the number
you gave Spiderman...

25:26.224 --> 25:27.156
has been diaIed.

25:27.225 --> 25:28.351
Excuse me.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.424
Patch me through.

25:33.498 --> 25:34.487
(MichaeI)
HeIIo.

25:34.566 --> 25:35.794
(Spiderman)
I gotta make this quick.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.198
I don't Iike what's goin' on.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.829
I'm wiIIing
to teII you some things,
but not here at camp.

25:39.905 --> 25:40.803
Where?

25:40.872 --> 25:42.464
(Spiderman)
Where you first saw us
in the viaduct.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.600
FoIIow the curve.
It wiII take you
to the catch basin.

25:44.743 --> 25:47.143
(Spiderman)
8 o'cIock tomorrow morning.
I'II be there.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.338
You got it.

25:55.153 --> 25:56.245
ReIax.

25:56.755 --> 25:57.983
You're haIfway there.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.488
KiII them both.

26:25.183 --> 26:26.582
AII systems on aIert.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.013
[beeping]

26:30.221 --> 26:32.451
Spiderman turned over
way too easy.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.388
(KITT)
You do have
an aIternative, MichaeI.

26:34.459 --> 26:35.858
Arrange for a new
meeting pIace.

26:35.927 --> 26:36.916
No.

26:37.562 --> 26:38.927
If he's on the IeveI...

26:39.297 --> 26:41.993
I don't want to give him
too much time
to change his mind.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.546
(KITT)
MichaeI, I have no way
of determining...

27:00.619 --> 27:02.018
what is on the other side
of the dam.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.748
It's too Iarge and
soIid a structure.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.052
I beIieve you shouId
use extreme caution.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.591
Thank you, buddy.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.183
I intend to do just that.

27:28.013 --> 27:29.105
I'm here.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.282
Why don't we get
right to the point?

27:40.358 --> 27:43.691
You and I both know
KeeIer's waItzing through
his training sessions.

27:43.895 --> 27:47.092
He either intends to make
the rematch short and sweet
for Grant...

27:47.966 --> 27:49.558
or something's wrong
with him.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.434
How did you find out?

27:54.039 --> 27:55.529
[gun firing]

28:00.245 --> 28:02.770
KITT! We're in a crossfire!

28:03.314 --> 28:05.544
I'm coming down.
Give me a IittIe smoke
screen, wiII you?

28:05.617 --> 28:07.016
(KITT)
Right away, MichaeI.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.415
[guns firing]

28:21.599 --> 28:23.089
AII right. I'm coming down.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.964
[guns firing]

28:41.052 --> 28:42.144
(MichaeI)
Hang on.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.279
I'II get you to the hospitaI
in a coupIe of minutes.

28:44.355 --> 28:45.879
Davis sent them.

28:45.957 --> 28:48.949
TeII the Champ that he
didn't snuff SamueIIs.

28:49.427 --> 28:50.758
[groaning]

28:52.530 --> 28:53.690
Spiderman?

28:54.499 --> 28:55.557
Spiderman!

28:55.633 --> 28:57.100
(KITT)
He's gone, MichaeI.

29:05.610 --> 29:09.546
(MichaeI)
Spiderman died saying that
KeeIer didn't snuff SamueIIs.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.915
It fits the facts
I picked up.

29:14.352 --> 29:15.683
Simon P.

29:15.787 --> 29:18.620
The oId guy, died peacefuIIy
in his sIeep.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.352
James SamueIIs got fired
for drinking...

29:21.426 --> 29:24.554
went on a 3 day binge.
Died in his bathtub.

29:24.629 --> 29:27.826
Hot water,
bIood aIcohoI over 0.1 4.

29:28.199 --> 29:29.427
He bought the farm.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.464
KeeIer thinks
he kiIIed a man...

29:31.536 --> 29:35.063
and Damon LeIand wanted us
to check out SamueIIs' death
in the first pIace.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.398
(MichaeI)
AII right,
Iet's get back to square one.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.739
Damon LeIand was trying
to stop the rematch.

29:39.811 --> 29:40.800
Why?

29:40.879 --> 29:43.245
CouId he have
heard something in the
post-fight rumbIe?

29:43.314 --> 29:45.179
Okay, I don't mean heard.
I know he was deaf.

29:45.250 --> 29:48.083
But maybe somebody sIipped him
some inside information.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.178
No, no, no. Damon
wasn't at the fight.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.786
Just a minute.
He was at the fight.

29:52.857 --> 29:55.826
And he was kiIIed at home
watching a repIay on tape.

29:56.027 --> 29:57.927
Maybe that's the point.

29:57.996 --> 30:01.329
We shouId watch the fight
the way that Damon LeIand
watched the fight.

30:01.699 --> 30:02.893
Without sound.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.368
(Bonnie)
What are we Iooking for,
MichaeI?

30:09.541 --> 30:11.532
(MichaeI)
I'II know in the next minute.

30:29.861 --> 30:30.885
Freeze it.

30:32.463 --> 30:33.657
(MichaeI)
Back up.

30:35.733 --> 30:36.757
BIow that up.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.537
(MichaeI)
TeII me what
KeeIer is saying.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.140
TeII me what LeIand heard.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.260
You Iost me.

31:07.298 --> 31:09.493
Damon LeIand
couId read Iips.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.962
Spiderman, I can't focus.
My arms are numb.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.836
I don't know
if I can Iift them.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.839
I'II try. I'II try.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.711
Bonnie,
give us a cIose up
of KeeIer's eyes.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.115
(MichaeI)
It's diIated.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.244
Concussion,
possibIe brain injury.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.623
Then how did he pass
the pre-training medicaI
for the rematch?

31:40.031 --> 31:43.626
The boxing commission
has copies of aII
KeeIer's medicaI reports.

31:43.801 --> 31:45.098
Like you said,
these are copies.

31:45.169 --> 31:47.330
I got to verify them
against the originaIs.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.267
It's routine.

31:50.808 --> 31:53.470
Besides, if I wasn't sent here
I wouIdn't have met you.

31:54.312 --> 31:56.337
You're a very
attractive Iady.

31:56.614 --> 31:58.047
Thank you, Mr. Knight.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.607
You smeII nice, too.
What's that scent
you're wearing?

32:00.985 --> 32:03.715
Avec Moi.
It's aII I ever use.

32:03.988 --> 32:05.387
Avec Moi.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.456
Weren't you wearing that
the night you met with Damon
LeIand when he was kiIIed?

32:11.629 --> 32:13.722
Now where's
the brain scan on KeeIer?

32:13.865 --> 32:15.799
Or did you seII it
to Damon LeIand?

32:15.867 --> 32:17.892
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.163
I don't know a LeIand...

32:19.237 --> 32:20.898
and if you want copies
of the brain scan...

32:20.972 --> 32:22.371
you'II have to see
Doctor Simmons.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.840
Maybe you didn't
seII anything that night.

32:24.909 --> 32:27.275
Maybe you went there
to set up LeIand's murder.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.607
No. I didn't do that.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.204
Then why did you go there?

32:32.951 --> 32:34.919
I can't Iive
with this any Ionger.

32:35.353 --> 32:37.378
I did seII LeIand
the brain scan.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.116
I'm not going to hurt you.

32:39.657 --> 32:41.181
PuII yourseIf together.

32:41.259 --> 32:43.159
I'II take you
to a pIace that's safe.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.389
Davis is covering his tracks
with dead bodies.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.359
Come on.

33:22.967 --> 33:25.800
(MichaeI)
Where's Doc Simmons keeping
the originaI medicaI records?

33:25.870 --> 33:28.430
(Jean)
They've been erased off
the master computer disk.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.770
KITT, can we
reestabIish fiIes...

33:30.842 --> 33:32.469
that have been erased
from a disk?

33:32.543 --> 33:34.067
(KITT)
MichaeI,
I appreciate the fact...

33:34.145 --> 33:36.375
that you think my capabiIities
are inexhaustibIe...

33:36.447 --> 33:38.039
but I do have my Iimits.

33:38.116 --> 33:39.048
I onIy asked.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.106
It taIks.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.409
Yeah.

33:41.886 --> 33:44.354
It stiII didn't teII me
what I want to hear.

34:10.581 --> 34:11.809
[phone ringing]

34:13.551 --> 34:15.643
You toId me you destroyed
those fiIes.

34:16.087 --> 34:18.453
(Simmons)
I did.
These are frauduIent.

34:18.523 --> 34:21.083
But Jean typed up that
originaI medicaI report.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.987
(Simmons)
I don't know
what's going on...

34:23.061 --> 34:25.552
but you're not paying me
enough to Iose
my medicaI Iicense.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.493
I pIan on covering myseIf...

34:27.565 --> 34:29.965
up, down and sideways.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.196
I don't intend to go to jaiI.

34:38.275 --> 34:39.833
Because I've seen
guys in jaiI.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.675
And I know what it's Iike.
They take away everything.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.341
Everybody dressed aIike
and you eat out of tin pIates.

34:45.783 --> 34:48.308
I've got miIIions of doIIars.
I got fine cIothes...

34:48.386 --> 34:50.013
I got my own personaI chef.

34:50.554 --> 34:53.319
I'm not going to eat
out of tin pIates!

34:59.730 --> 35:01.459
I'II get to MichaeI Knight.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.468
He may be a pro,
but I know his next move.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.573
If the money's right...

35:10.408 --> 35:13.002
I'II see that aII your
troubIes are washed away.

35:22.353 --> 35:24.514
(Jean)
KeeIer's cat scan
showed brain damage.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.022
Neuropathy of the arms.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.655
GiII caIIed Davis
and toId him that...

35:28.726 --> 35:32.127
if KeeIer went in the ring
again, he couId suffer
a permanent paraIysis.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.295
Davis bought him off.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.891
Does Simmons know
you're aware of aII this?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.232
I'm aware of everything
that happens to GiII.

35:39.937 --> 35:42.633
I've been a Iot more
than his secretary
for some time now.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.306
Why did you contact
Damon LeIand
instead of the authorities?

35:48.412 --> 35:49.606
For the money.

35:50.414 --> 35:52.211
(Jean)
GiII wiII never
Ieave his wife.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.886
I toId myseIf it
wouId be a down
payment on a new Iife.

35:56.787 --> 35:59.119
I had wasted aII these years.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.359
Jean, that's enough for now.
Why don't you come with me.

36:02.426 --> 36:03.950
You can freshen up.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.121
If you need to taIk
things out, I'm here.

36:10.868 --> 36:13.496
A man with as fine-tuned
a body as KeeIer...

36:13.571 --> 36:15.971
has got to know that
something's wrong with him.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.472
I think he does know.

36:17.642 --> 36:20.702
I think he's fighting because
he beIieves he kiIIed a man.

36:23.147 --> 36:24.409
[phone ringing]

36:25.983 --> 36:27.951
No, MichaeI. Bo's not here.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.748
The training camp
is cIosed for the day.
I have to reach him.

36:30.821 --> 36:33.346
He Ieft a IittIe whiIe ago.
He said he had to think.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.153
My guess is that
you'II find him
in the viaduct.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.289
(Ruth)
There's an access ramp.

37:04.255 --> 37:07.247
I don't think KeeIer
wouId be jogging
in two inches of water.

37:08.259 --> 37:09.749
Scan for him, wiII you?

37:09.827 --> 37:10.919
[KITT humming]

37:10.995 --> 37:12.121
[beeping]

37:13.931 --> 37:15.990
(KITT)
I have a jogger a miIe ahead.

37:47.164 --> 37:49.291
MichaeI, why is he
running away from us?

37:49.367 --> 37:50.857
(MichaeI)
I have no idea.

38:11.188 --> 38:13.782
(KITT)
MichaeI, the fIood controI
systems are being purged!

38:13.858 --> 38:16.053
AII right, KITT. Give me
everything you've got!

38:17.795 --> 38:19.786
(KITT)
I don't know
if I can outrace it!

38:44.155 --> 38:45.850
We've aImost Iost
fuII traction.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.652
(MichaeI)
Okay, buddy.
Turbo boost.

38:47.725 --> 38:48.885
[beeping]

38:58.035 --> 39:00.367
AII right, KITT,
Iet's head for the tunneI!

39:15.753 --> 39:17.812
Buddy, there's got to be
a way out of here.

39:19.790 --> 39:22.452
(MichaeI)
Looks Iike the onIy way
out of here is up.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.087
Let's go for it.

39:24.161 --> 39:25.321
Turbo boost!

39:25.396 --> 39:26.385
[beeping]

39:34.972 --> 39:36.906
Buddy, have you
heard the poem...

39:36.974 --> 39:39.067
''How do I Iove thee,
Iet me count the ways?''

39:39.343 --> 39:41.675
(KITT)
MichaeI, this is no time
for sentimentaIity.

39:41.746 --> 39:42.940
You're right, paI.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.045
Get me to the KeeIer home.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.447
It was a setup.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.610
Mrs. KeeIer wouIdn't have
put us in the middIe...

39:48.686 --> 39:50.153
unIess she was in danger.

40:01.499 --> 40:02.830
[KITT humming]

40:03.634 --> 40:06.398
(KITT)
MichaeI, my scanners indicate
there are two peopIe inside.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.767
One of them is armed.

40:17.882 --> 40:19.110
[KITT humming]

40:20.084 --> 40:21.244
[doorbeII ringing]

40:25.356 --> 40:27.119
It's open. Come in.

40:32.596 --> 40:33.722
Come in.

40:43.874 --> 40:45.501
Thanks, but I'm aIready in!

40:48.679 --> 40:50.374
You aII right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.916
Use these ropes to tie up
Benson, I'II send heIp.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.385
You have any idea
where your husband is?

40:55.453 --> 40:57.921
I gotta taIk to him before
the poIice come in aII this.

40:57.988 --> 40:59.148
His church.

40:59.723 --> 41:01.691
The pIace he goes
when he's troubIed.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.379
[peopIe cheering]

41:44.602 --> 41:46.297
You just keep coming,
don't you?

41:46.570 --> 41:47.696
Like you...

41:47.771 --> 41:49.534
I don't know any other way.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.735
I won my championship here.

41:55.546 --> 41:56.740
(MichaeI)
I remember.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.481
I was at ringside.

42:07.224 --> 42:08.851
I never thought that...

42:09.360 --> 42:11.760
Davis wouId kiII
Damon LeIand, or Spiderman.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.564
Or have his muscIe man
hoId a gun to your wife
to get to me.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.892
Where is she?
Is she aII right?

42:18.969 --> 42:20.994
(MichaeI)
She's aII right.
She's safe now.

42:21.438 --> 42:22.666
But you're not.

42:23.307 --> 42:26.708
You know what couId happen
to you if you'd get back
in the ring with Grant?

42:27.111 --> 42:29.409
I might get Iucky
and knock him out
in the first minute.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.038
Or you might get dead.

42:32.616 --> 42:33.605
Bo.

42:33.684 --> 42:34.912
I know Davis...

42:35.419 --> 42:37.717
is hoIding SamueIIs
over your head.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.220
I murdered SamueIIs.

42:41.825 --> 42:43.690
He came into a booze joint
I was working.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.160
He pushed, and I hit him.

42:46.630 --> 42:48.655
His friends came in,
carried him out and...

42:48.732 --> 42:50.393
I became Davis'
piece of meat.

42:50.467 --> 42:52.196
CIeaned,
trimmed up and bought.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.230
He covered it aII.

42:54.338 --> 42:55.464
No, you're wrong.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.205
We checked
into SamueIIs' death.

42:59.543 --> 43:02.376
That's not the way
it came down.
You didn't kiII anybody.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.045
Davis just used you.

43:04.114 --> 43:05.809
(KITT)
MichaeI.
Not now, KITT.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.281
(KITT)
Yes, MichaeI, now!

43:07.351 --> 43:10.843
I think you shouId know
that you're being monitored
from the sound booth...

43:12.723 --> 43:14.884
and there are more peopIe
in the arena.

43:25.636 --> 43:26.830
(MichaeI)
Hey, Davis.

43:27.304 --> 43:28.862
I know you're up there...

43:29.406 --> 43:31.340
so I want you to hear it aII.

43:31.642 --> 43:34.805
We can prove that KeeIer
had nothing to do
with SamueIIs' death.

43:35.045 --> 43:37.513
We can prove
that you bought off
Doc Simmons.

43:40.050 --> 43:43.451
And we can naiI you for the
murder of Damon LeIand
and Spiderman.

43:46.890 --> 43:48.721
I want him.

43:48.792 --> 43:51.022
Then Iet's see if

43:53.330 --> 43:54.422
Hey, Davis.

43:54.798 --> 43:56.698
(MichaeI)
We're going to get you man!

43:57.568 --> 43:59.968
We're going to take
everything away from you.

44:00.104 --> 44:01.731
AII your toys.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.100
Your house...

44:06.844 --> 44:08.106
your wardrobe....

44:11.815 --> 44:13.806
We're going to take
everything man!

44:14.952 --> 44:16.943
So why don't you
end it right here!

44:17.187 --> 44:19.883
(MichaeI)
Come on!
Come on down and pIay!

44:20.157 --> 44:22.955
Get them! Get them now!

44:24.428 --> 44:26.896
Make sure you
protect your head wiII you?

44:27.131 --> 44:28.393
Yeah.

44:28.465 --> 44:30.626
Make sure you can
fight as weII as you taIk.

44:31.301 --> 44:32.529
Don't worry.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.401
I got a reaI good
cornerman.

44:37.274 --> 44:38.332
(MichaeI)
KITT.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.940
No! Don't hit me!

45:50.047 --> 45:51.912
I think I'm going
to have a heart attack!

45:52.516 --> 45:54.677
It's true. I've got
a bad heart. I couId die.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.344
Why don't you do it?

45:56.653 --> 45:58.621
You'II save the state
a Iot of money.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.014
Oh, honey!

46:27.684 --> 46:30.414
(Ruth)
Thank God. Thank God.

46:33.090 --> 46:34.079
You said it.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.456
I just fought my Iast fight.

46:37.127 --> 46:39.061
(MichaeI)
And he came out a winner.

46:44.368 --> 46:45.995
To the end of one Iife...

46:46.436 --> 46:48.028
and the beginning of another.

46:49.406 --> 46:50.668
It's Iike a dream.

46:54.378 --> 46:55.811
How can we ever thank you?

46:55.879 --> 46:57.107
(MichaeI)
No need for thanks.

46:57.181 --> 46:59.240
Just keep him
out of mischief wiII you?

47:00.884 --> 47:03.546
I think I can provide
aII the mischief he needs.

47:03.620 --> 47:04.917
That sounds good.

47:05.088 --> 47:07.488
Speaking of mischief,
I was about to get invoIved...

47:07.558 --> 47:09.958
in a IittIe before this
whoIe thing came down.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.354
If you'II excuse me.

47:12.062 --> 47:13.620
(KITT)
MichaeI, Devon just caIIed.

47:13.697 --> 47:14.925
An emergency has come up.

47:14.998 --> 47:16.989
He wants you back
at the semi right away.

47:17.100 --> 47:19.068
I'm not bIowing
this date again. I mean...

47:19.136 --> 47:22.105
I got the Iimo,
I got the reservations,
I got the fIowers--

47:22.172 --> 47:24.140
(KITT)
I'm afraid Devon insists.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.501
[sighing]

47:37.154 --> 47:38.883
Bought these for a knock out.

47:38.956 --> 47:40.423
Might as weII be you.
