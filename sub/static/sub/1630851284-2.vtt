His dead grandmother?

03:12.084 --> 03:13.692
No.
He came to me.

I don't care what you've done.
All that matters

is that no grandson of mine's
gonna go to jail.

03:34.864 --> 03:37.457

Are you off your meds

03:37.609 --> 03:38.533
or on new meds?

03:38.627 --> 03:40.552
Bart, don't you remember?

03:40.779 --> 03:43.780
I just wired all that money
to pay your bail.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.558
Whoa, Grampa,
I think you were...

03:46.785 --> 03:47.801

I got bamboozled out of my money

04:27.601 --> 04:30.010

04:30.162 --> 04:32.587
It's not his fault.
Some scammer

04:32.681 --> 04:34.088

04:46.194 --> 04:49.437
No. You were just trying
to be a good grandparent.

took advantage of you.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.534

04:54.686 --> 04:58.946
Bart in jail? I would have
fallen for that, too.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.132
I mean, how much money
could they have taken

05:00.283 --> 05:02.192
from a retired,
old meatball man--

05:02.210 --> 05:05.211
50 bucks plus a pocketful
of hard candies?

05:05.364 --> 05:08.140
Here you go, Dad. I'll cover it.
What's the damage?

05:08.291 --> 05:11.034
Ten thousand dollars!

05:11.053 --> 05:12.385
(all gasp)

05:12.538 --> 05:14.220
Where the hell
did you get that kind of money,

05:14.315 --> 05:16.540
you broken-down
old meatball man?

05:16.633 --> 05:19.133
It's 20 years
of my cribbage winnings,

05:19.153 --> 05:21.545
saved up in a cigar box.

05:21.563 --> 05:25.490

and now it's all gone.

05:25.717 --> 05:26.575

05:27.644 --> 05:30.070
No. No.

05:30.238 --> 05:31.496
No!

05:33.000 --> 05:35.575
I had an inheritance
and you gave it away?

05:35.727 --> 05:37.985
I'm so mad I could kill you,

05:38.080 --> 05:39.913
but now I'd get nothing.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.090
I hope you live forever!

To my surviving Homers,

05:54.188 --> 05:56.413
I leave you $10,000

05:56.431 --> 05:59.082
-that I never told you about...

05:59.101 --> 06:00.767
-Oh!
-Huh?
-Yeah?

06:00.861 --> 06:03.177
...but then I lost it all
to a scam.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.771
So, because I'm a moron,

06:04.865 --> 06:06.681
I leave you nothing.

06:06.775 --> 06:08.700
ALL:
D'oh!

06:08.852 --> 06:10.443
Ten thousand dollars!

06:10.520 --> 06:12.537

That dream again?

06:12.689 --> 06:15.207
The money's gone, gone.

06:15.358 --> 06:18.860
But how can you miss money
you never knew you had?

06:18.954 --> 06:21.380
That's the worst part:
to find out got money,

06:21.531 --> 06:23.790
but you lost money,
so you have it,

06:23.884 --> 06:25.108
but you don't have it.

06:25.201 --> 06:27.386
Oh, it's giving me whipcash.

06:27.537 --> 06:29.779
(whimpers, grunts)

06:31.116 --> 06:33.950
Just think of all the ways
my life could have been better

06:33.952 --> 06:36.395
with that ten grand.

06:43.812 --> 06:45.362
(moans): Oh.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.817
So, uh, we're asking each family
to chip in $50

06:50.911 --> 06:53.136
for a new
fundraising thermometer.

06:53.229 --> 06:56.415
Oh, yeah, 50 bucks--
I would totally donate that

06:56.566 --> 06:57.732
if my father hadn't

06:57.751 --> 07:00.977
given away $10,000!

07:00.996 --> 07:03.588
Um, it's just
a suggested amount.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.317
Sure, ten grand might not
sound like much to you teachers,

07:07.410 --> 07:09.911
but I choose inheriting $10,000

07:09.930 --> 07:12.989
over earning a million.

07:12.991 --> 07:14.582
And all of you
would do the same!

07:14.676 --> 07:16.342
Homer, not here.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.845
Because generational wealth
is the purest,

07:18.997 --> 07:21.014
most sacred kind of money
there is.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.942
But my father fell for
some super-obvious scam

07:24.169 --> 07:26.186
because his brain is made of

07:26.338 --> 07:28.763
powdered mashed potatoes.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.659
So, no, I will not be donating.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.953
(huffs)

07:35.956 --> 07:38.348
-Oh...
-Marge, if I may, I-I dealt with
a similar situation

07:38.366 --> 07:40.274
with my mother.
She got a phone call

07:40.352 --> 07:42.352
claiming punk rockers were
threatening to cut my hair

07:42.370 --> 07:45.038
into a Mohawk, which is
a distinctive hairstyle...

07:45.132 --> 07:46.356
I know what it is.

07:46.449 --> 07:48.525
This place got us through it.

07:48.543 --> 07:50.193
Hmm.

07:50.212 --> 07:52.362
This could be just what we need.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.214
Oh, uh, sorry,
that's not for you to keep.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.683
I don't get
many business cards.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.646
Group therapy? In my day,
we dealt with horrible shame

08:01.798 --> 08:04.708
by getting blind drunk,
stumbling into a hobo camp

08:04.801 --> 08:06.209
and fighting their king.

08:06.228 --> 08:08.636
Sometimes it worked,
sometimes it didn't.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.988
Just give it a try, Abe.

08:10.139 --> 08:13.033
It'll help to know
that you're not alone.

08:14.386 --> 08:16.236
(chuckles)
Nice, Marge.

08:16.388 --> 08:18.663
Making Dad sit through
a pathetic sob-fest

08:18.815 --> 08:22.149
with his fellow losers
is the perfect punishment.

08:22.227 --> 08:24.461
There's a group for you, too.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.824
I... (grunts) wish I never voted
to build this community center.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.009
(Marge grunts)

08:31.236 --> 08:33.903
(sighs) I should have known
mortgage lenders

08:33.922 --> 08:35.905
don't take
Applebee's gift cards.

08:35.924 --> 08:38.258
He said if I didn't wire
the money to the power company,

08:38.410 --> 08:40.668
they'd shut off my electricity.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.004
I<i> am</i> the power company.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.247
Catfished.
Ooh!

08:44.266 --> 08:46.358
Now it seems so obvious

08:46.509 --> 08:49.176
that I would never meet
the real Melissa Joan Hart

08:49.196 --> 08:51.421
in a online billiards forum.

08:51.439 --> 08:54.424
These criminals
target the good in all of us,

08:54.442 --> 08:56.609
so the first step
is to take a deep breath

08:56.762 --> 08:58.928
and forgive ourselves.

08:58.947 --> 09:02.615
(all inhale, exhale)

09:02.768 --> 09:06.378
My mother paid hackers to return
her stolen computer photos.

09:06.605 --> 09:08.713
(groans) They weren't gone.
They were backed up

09:08.865 --> 09:11.608
to the cloud, Dropbox,
Time Machine--

09:11.701 --> 09:13.610
things of that nature.

09:13.628 --> 09:16.871
Now, these are the things you
should never say to a victim.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.965
"I would never
have fallen for that,"

09:19.117 --> 09:21.618
"Everyone knows
about that scam,"

09:21.711 --> 09:23.803
and "What were you thinking?"

09:23.897 --> 09:25.880
I would have never
fallen for that!

09:25.899 --> 09:27.732
Everyone knows about that scam!

09:27.959 --> 09:29.809
What were you thinking?!

09:29.961 --> 09:31.311
No, it wasn't my fault.

09:31.463 --> 09:34.055
This group taught me
not to feel shame.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.150
I'm on a path of healing
and self-empowerment.

09:37.302 --> 09:39.135
You better not be.

09:39.228 --> 09:42.247
Now, what do we say
to shamers like him?

09:42.398 --> 09:44.565
ALL:
Shaming is blaming.

09:44.659 --> 09:47.419
Yes, 100% agree!

09:49.648 --> 09:51.256
(grunts)

09:51.483 --> 09:53.499
How could you treat
Grampa like that?

09:53.594 --> 09:55.927
You think you're so smart.
Do you really think

09:56.154 --> 09:58.579
the same thing
wouldn't have happened to you?

09:58.673 --> 10:00.006
Me? Impossible.

10:00.158 --> 10:02.008
I'm too savvy.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.769
This savvy!
See?

10:04.996 --> 10:08.014
Dad, anyone can get scammed.
Even me.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.108
I paid the bullies
for wedgie insurance.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.335
But the minute
I got a wedgie, bam!

10:12.428 --> 10:14.687
I got hit with a deductible--
another wedgie!

10:14.840 --> 10:16.281
And my rates went up.

10:16.432 --> 10:19.433
That's why I never get
any insurance.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.119
I got an email
saying I qualified

10:21.196 --> 10:23.179
for the Saxophone
Junior Olympics,

10:23.198 --> 10:26.107
but when I clicked the link,
they hacked my phone

10:26.126 --> 10:29.777
and stole
my Audible listener credits.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.020
(laughs)

10:31.039 --> 10:33.873
You clicked the link?
(laughing)

10:33.967 --> 10:37.785
That's so...
Who clicks the link?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.712
Even children are being scammed?

10:39.865 --> 10:42.548
Well, maybe there's a few more
bad apples than I thought.

10:42.701 --> 10:47.128
But I still have to believe
the barrel is mostly good.

10:47.222 --> 10:49.630
Oh, Marge, how I envy
your sweet innocence.

10:49.724 --> 10:53.818
The world is a blender full
of sharks set on extra teeth.

10:54.045 --> 10:56.713
So you got to be like me--
always on guard

10:56.806 --> 10:59.974
-so you're never a sucker.
-(doorbell rings)

11:00.068 --> 11:02.309
Delivery for Homer Simpson.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.978
Why'd you buy all these knives?

11:04.072 --> 11:06.890
They're not knives.
They're the future of cutlery.

11:06.983 --> 11:08.574
Put 'em in the garage
with the others.

11:08.669 --> 11:09.542
Others?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.004
-(gasps)
-Cutlife is a famous

11:13.156 --> 11:15.322
multi-level marketing company.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.510
Dad, you fell
for a pyramid scheme.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.679
Scheme? No way.

11:20.906 --> 11:22.405
They didn't even
want to let me join.

11:22.498 --> 11:25.425
But, luckily, at the last
minute, a space opened up.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.668
How many knives
have you even sold?

11:27.746 --> 11:30.021
(laughs)
I don't sell them.

11:30.248 --> 11:31.764
I engage opportunity handlers

11:31.858 --> 11:33.933
to distributize them for me,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.177
the expandibution manager.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.512
It's all
part of Charles E. Cutlife's

11:38.532 --> 11:41.199
three-dimensional
triangle system.

11:41.350 --> 11:43.109
-Look!
-BART: Why can't Dad

11:43.261 --> 11:45.036
ever get arrested in a suit?

11:45.263 --> 11:46.763
Face it, genius:

11:46.856 --> 11:50.357
you got scammed.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.211
(sobs)
She's right. Everyone's right.

11:53.438 --> 11:56.214
Don't look at my gullible face!
(sobs)

11:57.050 --> 12:00.034
And so I consign to the flames

12:00.053 --> 12:02.628
a monument to my own stupidity.

12:02.781 --> 12:03.680
-No!
-(grunts)

12:06.226 --> 12:09.561
Now, isn't there someone
you need to apologize to?

12:09.712 --> 12:11.045
Maybe your father?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.379
Yeah, you're right.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.475
I said such horrible things
to him.

12:15.627 --> 12:16.693
(gasps)

12:17.979 --> 12:19.796
All that time
I was yelling at you,

12:19.889 --> 12:21.740
it turns out I'm a sucker, too.

12:21.891 --> 12:23.299
Will you forgive me, Dad?

12:23.392 --> 12:25.301
Of course, son.
Hopefully, we've all

12:25.320 --> 12:28.062
come out of this
a little more savvy.

12:28.139 --> 12:29.748
(phone rings)

12:29.975 --> 12:32.417
Hello?
Yes, this is a grandparent

12:32.644 --> 12:36.145
of a boy or girl. Sure,
put him or her on the phone.

12:36.164 --> 12:38.648
No!
Lisa's in jail!

12:38.783 --> 12:41.334
Grampa, they're trying
to trick you again.

12:41.486 --> 12:43.336
(gasps)
It's the same swindler.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.597
He must think
I'm greedy for more.

12:45.673 --> 12:47.015
(gasps)
I got an idea.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.511
Grampa, you got to keep talking
so that guy stays on the phone.

12:51.605 --> 12:52.920
Keep talking?

12:53.014 --> 12:54.680
I've been preparing
for this moment

12:54.833 --> 12:56.274
my entire life.

12:56.425 --> 12:58.092
<i> MAN:</i>

-In my day, we didn't have

so everyone took turns blowing

unless you hired a Dutch family
to blow on your food for you.

13:11.199 --> 13:14.417
Breezies is what you'd call 'em.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.060
Okay, I've run all three hours
of the call

13:41.212 --> 13:42.821
through open-source
audio software,

13:42.972 --> 13:44.489
and the unique pattern

13:44.658 --> 13:48.493
and roller-coaster screams

13:49.737 --> 13:53.072
...ladies and gentlemen,
the address of the scammer.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.150
Whoa, we could
get the money back.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.077
It's not about the money.

13:58.229 --> 14:00.913
I want to show that bad guy
the face of the old man

14:01.066 --> 14:04.067
whose love and decency
he exploited.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.660
Oh, honey, you have
a beautiful heart.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.920
But make no mistake--

14:08.089 --> 14:10.723
it is about the money!

14:22.587 --> 14:24.279
♪ ♪

14:29.761 --> 14:32.019
Kids, today you're gonna
learn an important lesson:

14:32.113 --> 14:34.688
sometimes the sheep
get back their wool.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.375
(scoffs) No, they don't.
They just grow more wool.

14:37.602 --> 14:39.878
What are you, a shepherd?
Come on, Dad.

14:40.105 --> 14:41.963
Let's go get
my eventual money back.

14:43.532 --> 14:45.199
How are we gonna
get past the guard?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.126
Aw, don't worry about that.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.263
My<i> friends</i> can get us in.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.559
That's the surgical precision
you only get

14:54.710 --> 14:56.728
from the finest Idaho steel.

14:56.955 --> 14:59.789
Amazing.
I'll take the full set.

14:59.882 --> 15:01.641
Oh, you're not
buying the knives.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.142
I could sell them?

15:03.294 --> 15:06.479
No, you can sell other people
on selling them.

15:06.631 --> 15:10.224
These knives sell
selling themselves themselves.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.969
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime!

15:13.062 --> 15:16.456
I'm gonna go tell my pregnant
wife about my new career.

15:17.733 --> 15:20.084
Okay, Grampa,
we're gonna find that bad guy

15:20.311 --> 15:22.587
and get you some justice.

15:22.738 --> 15:25.757
(low overlapping chatter)

15:25.984 --> 15:27.592
Uh, which one's the scammer?

15:27.669 --> 15:29.819
They're all the scammer.

15:29.837 --> 15:31.912
The IRS tax police
are on their way to your home,

15:31.932 --> 15:34.915
but we'll accept immediate
payment in<i> Fortnite</i> V-bucks.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.435
Oh, your Airbnb
is all ready to go, there.

15:37.662 --> 15:39.512
I'm fluffing the towels
right now.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.105
Fluff, fluff.

15:41.257 --> 15:42.832
There's so many of them.

15:42.925 --> 15:43.924
(clears throat)

15:44.002 --> 15:46.852
You are all
in an unethical industry

15:46.947 --> 15:49.322
and we have called
the authorities.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.358
(panting)
Oh, man.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.194
Another boiler room
of phone hucksters.

15:55.363 --> 15:57.530
All right, scambags,
you know the drill:

15:57.682 --> 16:01.584
you don't got to go home,
but you can't grift here.

16:04.038 --> 16:06.631
-Come on.
-What?
-Really?

16:08.284 --> 16:10.526
Aren't you going to arrest them?

16:10.619 --> 16:12.303
Marge, you shut down
one of these,

16:12.455 --> 16:14.621
five more
pop up in its place.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.975
Phone fraud and
Halloween costumes for pets

16:17.160 --> 16:19.702
are America's
only growth industries.

16:19.795 --> 16:22.963
So they're just employees
doing this for a paycheck?

16:22.983 --> 16:25.057
I wish we got paid in money.

16:25.134 --> 16:27.727
All we get is minimum wage
and gift cards.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.895
-Do you have my dad's money?
-No.

16:30.048 --> 16:31.881
-Do you have my money?
-Nope.

16:31.899 --> 16:33.474
Can I have $10,000?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.142
BART'S VOICE:
Not gonna happen, dude.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.069
Hey, you sound familiar.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.997
Don't have a cow, man.

16:40.058 --> 16:42.649
Is this what
we wanted to happen?

16:42.669 --> 16:46.762
Okay, I know this seems bad,
but... but, uh...

16:46.781 --> 16:50.399
Oh, come on, Mom, you always
see the good in everything.

16:50.401 --> 16:53.085
Well, on the bright side,

16:53.238 --> 16:55.829
if you look at it
a certain way...

16:55.998 --> 16:57.423
there is no bright side!

16:57.575 --> 17:00.259
The whole world is one big
criminal organization!

17:00.411 --> 17:04.004
From hedge funds to payday loans
to the NCAA,

17:04.024 --> 17:05.915
it's not just a few bad apples--

17:05.933 --> 17:08.434
it's the whole orchard
that's rotten!

17:08.528 --> 17:09.861
(grunts)

17:10.012 --> 17:11.678
Whoa, gift cards!

17:11.698 --> 17:12.938
Justice wasn't served,

17:13.033 --> 17:15.575
but dinner is.

17:17.019 --> 17:19.186
(groans)
I can't believe we ate

17:19.280 --> 17:21.931
$500 worth of appetizers.

17:21.949 --> 17:25.284
Revenge sliders
dipped in payback sauce.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.544
Mmm.

17:26.695 --> 17:28.713
Honey, you're not
sweating from overeating.

17:28.864 --> 17:30.531
What's wrong?

17:30.625 --> 17:34.443
These gift cards were obtained
by scamming innocent people.

17:34.462 --> 17:36.203
So no, thank you.

17:36.297 --> 17:37.630
You said it yourself--

17:37.782 --> 17:40.374
everyone in the world
is ripping off everyone else.

17:40.468 --> 17:42.894
Why shouldn't we wet our beaks?

17:43.045 --> 17:45.879
Oh, you got to try
these fried beaks.

17:45.973 --> 17:48.457
Dip the beak!
Dip the beak!

17:48.476 --> 17:50.810
Well, it seems like
no one else has a problem

17:50.904 --> 17:53.696
gorging on
ill-gotten appetizers.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.991
Beak me.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.999
(munching)

18:05.827 --> 18:08.144
With that deep-fried morsel,

18:08.162 --> 18:11.163
my victory is complete.

18:11.316 --> 18:13.149
Uh, we're all seeing

18:13.167 --> 18:15.927
the freak in the sandals, right?
(burps)

18:16.078 --> 18:18.745
Yes, but this can't be real.

18:18.765 --> 18:22.675
We probably just ate too many
wasabi mac and cheese balls.

18:22.844 --> 18:24.660
Silence, you mewling wretches,

18:24.753 --> 18:28.164
for I am Loki, god of mischief.

18:28.257 --> 18:30.666
But I am known by many names

18:30.759 --> 18:32.693
and take many forms.

18:35.006 --> 18:37.189
Buy crypto, suckers!

18:37.283 --> 18:39.358
And my handiwork of deception

18:39.452 --> 18:42.528
is woven into the fabric
of the universe.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.847
From the Ticketmaster
convenience fee

18:44.940 --> 18:47.291
to the NCAA.

18:47.443 --> 18:50.611
Oh, lord of appetizers,
I kneel before you.

18:50.705 --> 18:54.357
Who shall I smother with ranch
in your name?

18:54.450 --> 18:58.194
Well, Loki, you've already
taken an old man's life savings.

18:58.212 --> 18:59.862
What more do you want?

18:59.881 --> 19:02.140
I have come here to...

19:02.367 --> 19:03.457
'Zerz...

19:03.551 --> 19:05.125
to take my prize:

19:05.219 --> 19:08.371
an honest woman's belief
in the good of mankind.

19:08.389 --> 19:11.390
And now, as the old laws demand,

19:11.484 --> 19:14.877
I must bestow
upon the vanquished a kiss.

19:14.896 --> 19:16.154
Mwah.

19:16.381 --> 19:18.731
Ha-ha!
There are no old laws.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.974
God of mischief does it again!

19:20.994 --> 19:23.219
Now, off to add
more blackout dates

19:23.237 --> 19:25.830
to Disneyland annual passes.

19:25.981 --> 19:29.408
(giggles)

19:29.502 --> 19:31.294
Suckers.

19:32.154 --> 19:33.838
Whoa, that was weird.

19:34.065 --> 19:35.965
Should we get the rest to go?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.826
Excuse me, I'm out of gas

19:39.846 --> 19:41.495
and left my wallet at home.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.996
Would you lend me $20?

19:43.016 --> 19:44.998
I'll mail it back to you,
I promise.

19:45.092 --> 19:47.834
Uh, I'm sorry,
but that is an obvious scam.

19:47.929 --> 19:49.503
Uh, go find another sucker.

19:49.597 --> 19:52.081
Is this it-- from now on,
I live in a world

19:52.099 --> 19:55.084
where nobody trusts anybody?
