00:25.126 --> 00:28.460

predictable range. Until here.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.996
- A direct signal
from the Master. If we can

00:30.998 --> 00:32.731
set it out from the rest
of the<i> strigoi</i> static,

00:32.733 --> 00:34.867

to track him down.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.890

embedded in there.

the Master arranged
for a piece of cargo from Egypt

to arrive here in New York
via ship.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.897

Now, the<i> Lumen</i> recounts

21:06.899 --> 21:09.767

21:09.769 --> 21:12.236
in which an army
of Egyptians managed

Is it possible that the cargo

is that very same Ancient?

21:21.881 --> 21:24.949
(grunting)

21:24.951 --> 21:27.151

(Ancients growling)

21:29.956 --> 21:32.623
So,

21:32.625 --> 21:35.092
