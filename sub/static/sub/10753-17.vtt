WEBVTT

00:07.887 --> 00:09.878
Cappuccino, half-caf, non-fat milk,

00:10.142 --> 00:12.417
enough foam
to be aesthetically pleasing.

00:12.687 --> 00:16.315
- But it mustn't leave a moustache.
- Cinnamon or chocolate?

00:16.652 --> 00:19.212
This is so complicated. Um, cinnamon.

00:19.490 --> 00:22.050
- And you?
- I'll have the...

00:22.328 --> 00:24.444
- Look, it's Daphne!
- Daphne!

00:24.707 --> 00:28.177
Oh, hello! Thought you might be here.
Please, sit.

00:28.505 --> 00:31.622
- I just stopped in for a bag of beans.
- Oh, well...

00:31.927 --> 00:33.679
- Can I help?
- Two pounds of...

00:33.930 --> 00:35.727
(Both)
Kenya blend.

00:35.975 --> 00:39.365
- You remembered.
- What about my order?

00:39.690 --> 00:41.920
Most people find it too intense.

00:42.194 --> 00:45.743
I like something that holds its body
on me tongue.

00:47.453 --> 00:49.523
We've spilt something. If you could...

00:51.501 --> 00:55.858
Would you like something robust,
if it didn't come on too strong?

00:56.218 --> 00:58.937
If it was a little bit sweet
I might like it.

00:59.222 --> 01:03.374
- Want to come try my special blend?
- I'd love to.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.422
Oh, nothing for me, thanks!

01:09.739 --> 01:13.049
That man is hitting on our Daphne.
How does she stand it?

01:14.497 --> 01:17.967
Apropos of nothing,
how are things with you and Maris?

01:19.130 --> 01:23.169
Are you implying my concern
for Daphne is less than pure?

01:23.512 --> 01:25.821
- You tell me.
-That's your shortcoming.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.409
You're always suspicious.

01:28.688 --> 01:32.044
You should have faith in people.
What's he doing?

01:33.279 --> 01:35.713
- Bagging her beans.
- Oh!

01:37.410 --> 01:41.323
I'm so excited.
Eric's taking me to hear his band.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.898
It's not me night off,
but I'll switch if that's OK.

01:46.091 --> 01:48.651
Isn't he lovely?
I have a nickname for him.

01:48.929 --> 01:52.160
Eric the Red. It favours him, doesn't it?
He looks like a Viking.

01:52.477 --> 01:54.513
- Well...
- Well, ta-ta.

01:54.773 --> 01:57.241
Oh, look at me. I forgot me beans.

01:57.526 --> 02:00.120
Earth to Daphne.

02:01.700 --> 02:06.410
How could she like him? He has
community college written all over him.

02:06.792 --> 02:10.420
Niles, this infatuation with Daphne
is getting out of hand.

02:10.757 --> 02:15.035
I didn't mind when it was flirtation,
but I can't help thinking that there's...

02:15.389 --> 02:20.861
This is symptomatic of something
wrong between you and Maris.

02:21.274 --> 02:24.505
- Is it?
- I can't lie.

02:24.822 --> 02:28.178
The truth is,
Maris and I are in a bit of a rut.

02:28.494 --> 02:31.645
We seem to have lapsed
into grey, numbing blandness.

02:31.959 --> 02:35.554
That's perfectly normal
in a relationship of some years.

02:35.881 --> 02:37.872
Try spicing things up a bit.

02:38.136 --> 02:40.411
You mean, boudoir-wise?

02:40.681 --> 02:43.673
- For starters, yeah.
- How?

02:43.979 --> 02:45.810
Well...

02:46.065 --> 02:48.420
The two of you could, uh...

02:50.448 --> 02:52.484
Well, you could...

02:52.742 --> 02:55.017
It's you and Maris, so you could...

02:57.459 --> 03:00.053
I'm stumped.

03:03.886 --> 03:06.002
How are you?

03:06.265 --> 03:08.221
You wanna know?
Or are you making conversation?

03:08.477 --> 03:11.310
If you wanna know, I'll tell you.

03:11.607 --> 03:13.757
I was making conversation.

03:14.028 --> 03:17.100
- Actually, I need advice.
- About what?

03:17.408 --> 03:19.558
A subject in which
you're well versed: sex.

03:19.829 --> 03:22.059
How can I help you?

03:22.333 --> 03:26.326
What do you do when the romance
goes out of a relationship?

03:26.673 --> 03:28.982
I get dressed and go home.

03:31.139 --> 03:34.415
Let's assume that you are capable
of a long-term relationship.

03:34.728 --> 03:39.483
- How would you keep things cooking?
- Once a boyfriend took me to a bar.

03:39.862 --> 03:45.095
We pretended we were strangers
picking each other up. That was hot.

03:46.498 --> 03:48.932
You used fantasy, role-playing?

03:49.211 --> 03:52.044
We had so much fun we tried it again.

03:52.341 --> 03:55.413
Next time, he got so into it
he went home with another woman.

03:56.974 --> 03:59.010
- I'm sorry.
- She was gorgeous.

03:59.269 --> 04:02.227
One more drink
I'd have gone home with her.

04:02.525 --> 04:05.722
Women need to see
the men they make love to

04:06.030 --> 04:08.783
as exciting, romantic figures.

04:09.077 --> 04:13.832
If you want to keep her interested,
create a fantasy for an evening.

04:14.210 --> 04:18.123
Personally, I think you'd make
a very sexy gladiator.

04:18.466 --> 04:24.019
- This is not for me. It's for Niles.
- In that case, make it a gladiola.

04:26.856 --> 04:28.209
(Doorbell)

04:29.694 --> 04:31.650
(Persistent doorbell)

04:35.120 --> 04:36.997
Niles! Niles!

04:37.248 --> 04:42.242
I'm sorry, but something horrible
has happened. Maris kicked me out.

04:42.633 --> 04:45.101
Dear God, why? What for?

04:47.000 --> 04:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:56.112 --> 04:59.741
- Oh, my!
- What's going on out there? Niles?

05:00.078 --> 05:01.830
Hello, Dad.

05:04.794 --> 05:07.262
- I don't want to know.
- Wait.

05:07.549 --> 05:10.017
There's a reasonable explanation.

05:10.303 --> 05:13.454
All right, but I reserve the right
to say "stop" at any time.

05:13.767 --> 05:16.918
My plan was to leave
a treasure map downstairs for Maris

05:17.231 --> 05:19.620
with clues to lead her
to my whereabouts.

05:19.902 --> 05:24.498
Then I'd hide in the linen closet
and wait for her to find me.

05:24.868 --> 05:26.824
Dressed like that?

05:27.080 --> 05:31.073
Actually, no. At the time,
I was wearing only my eye patch.

05:32.464 --> 05:35.262
But is it still an eye patch
if you wear it on your...

05:35.553 --> 05:37.305
Stop!

05:41.771 --> 05:46.367
There I was - ooh - with my little
plastic knife between my teeth.

05:46.738 --> 05:48.968
Suddenly the closet door opened,

05:49.242 --> 05:52.154
and I found myself
face to face with the maid.

05:53.833 --> 06:00.147
She screamed - what I gather were
unflattering things - in Guatemalan.

06:00.594 --> 06:05.987
Maris stumbled upon the scene
and ordered me out of the house.

06:06.395 --> 06:11.549
I barely had time to grab my pantaloons
and buckle my swash.

06:11.947 --> 06:13.744
(Dad laughs)

06:13.991 --> 06:17.620
Dad! Dad, it's not funny.

06:17.957 --> 06:19.993
Where did you get that stupid idea?

06:20.252 --> 06:22.129
Frasier?

06:22.380 --> 06:27.329
All I suggested was role-playing. You
came up with pirates of the Caribbean.

06:30.310 --> 06:33.825
- I've really bungled it, haven't l?
- These things happen.

06:34.149 --> 06:38.188
Why don't you stay here now,
and tomorrow you'll sort things out?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.363
What if we don't?

06:40.618 --> 06:44.247
They could use an extra busboy
at the Jolly Roger.

06:44.583 --> 06:47.893
I'll never be able to face the maid again.

06:48.214 --> 06:50.774
I don't think it's your face
she'll remember.

06:52.555 --> 06:56.025
Come on, Niles.
Everybody has an embarrassing story.

06:56.352 --> 06:59.310
Did I tell you about getting
locked out, in my underwear?

06:59.609 --> 07:02.123
- Every Thanksgiving.
- Don't worry,

07:02.404 --> 07:04.634
I won't be telling that story this year.

07:07.204 --> 07:11.163
Canadian goose down pillow,
Egyptian cotton sheet,

07:11.502 --> 07:15.290
- and a vicuna throw for if you're chilly.
- Perfect.

07:15.635 --> 07:18.866
The service would've done you boys
the world of good.

07:20.059 --> 07:22.812
- Good night!
- Good night.

07:23.105 --> 07:28.702
Maris and I have had difficulties before,
but nothing this serious.

07:29.115 --> 07:33.711
I feel terrible having her mad at me.
I wish I knew how to cry.

07:34.082 --> 07:37.438
- Don't be embarrassed on my account.
- No, it's not that.

07:37.754 --> 07:40.712
I just don't cry. It's not in my nature.

07:41.009 --> 07:43.967
When Maris' uncle died,
I shut my hand in a door,

07:44.265 --> 07:47.257
just to make a decent show
at the funeral.

07:48.438 --> 07:51.111
You're a complex little pirate,
aren't you?

07:53.196 --> 07:56.233
- Well, good night, Niles.
- Good night.

08:10.016 --> 08:12.576
Thank you, Eric.
I had a wonderful time.

08:12.854 --> 08:15.163
Me, too.

08:18.322 --> 08:21.200
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.905
(Niles whimpers)

08:37.977 --> 08:39.933
We've only had a few dates

08:40.191 --> 08:43.388
but I'm exhibiting
the three signs of love.

08:43.738 --> 08:45.694
I can't stop thinking about him.

08:45.950 --> 08:48.623
I can't eat
and I bought myself all new underwear.

08:51.417 --> 08:54.011
We got to get her a girlfriend to talk to.

08:57.928 --> 09:01.716
I called Maris.
She's in Arizona for the weekend.

09:02.060 --> 09:06.611
- Why?
- She's flown to her favourite spa

09:06.984 --> 09:10.659
to contemplate our marriage -
from a mud bath.

09:10.991 --> 09:15.189
It'll be good for her.
Eric thinks the earth is grounding.

09:15.541 --> 09:19.329
Eric, Eric! Must everything
always be about Eric?!

09:25.014 --> 09:28.893
I suggest when Maris returns
you have intensive couples therapy...

09:29.230 --> 09:32.461
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:34.363 --> 09:36.752
She just needs to know you love her.

09:37.034 --> 09:40.310
Buy her flowers. Fix a romantic dinner.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.581
- That'll make any woman forgive you.
- That will work?

09:43.879 --> 09:47.394
If it didn't, you wouldn't be here.

09:49.889 --> 09:55.282
I'm willing to try, but our cook
walked out in sympathy with Maris.

09:55.690 --> 09:59.000
I could help you.
I have a late date with Eric...

09:59.321 --> 10:01.994
...ca, an elderly Aunt Erica,

10:02.284 --> 10:06.994
..but I could have everything ready
by the time Mrs Crane arrives.

10:07.376 --> 10:10.049
Well, thank you, Daphne.

10:10.339 --> 10:12.569
What does Mrs Crane like to eat?

10:12.843 --> 10:14.879
You have free rein.

10:15.139 --> 10:19.769
Bear in mind she can't have
shellfish, poultry, red meat, nitrates,

10:20.147 --> 10:23.776
wheat, starch, sulphites, MSG or dairy.

10:26.032 --> 10:29.468
- Did I say nuts?
- Oh, I think that's implied.

10:34.754 --> 10:36.710
(Thunder)

10:44.186 --> 10:46.336
(Thunder)

10:51.449 --> 10:54.247
Come in and warm yourself by the fire.

10:54.537 --> 10:58.530
- How did you get so wet?
- One of your trees blew down.

10:58.878 --> 11:01.392
- I had to walk the last 100 yards.
- Oh.

11:01.674 --> 11:04.586
I must say, you have a beautiful home.

11:04.888 --> 11:08.676
Thank you. It was in Maris' family
for four generations.

11:09.020 --> 11:14.299
When I was an intern I drove through
these hills, never dreaming I'd live here.

11:14.695 --> 11:18.734
Then one afternoon, there was Maris,
looking so helpless,

11:19.077 --> 11:21.875
banging on the electric gates
with her little fists.

11:22.166 --> 11:25.681
- They'd locked her in?
- No, no, that was much later.

11:27.634 --> 11:30.228
This time she had been
at an antique mart.

11:30.514 --> 11:35.304
Bought a rare bell jar once owned by
Sylvia Plath. The gates failed to open.

11:35.688 --> 11:38.441
Naturally, I offered my assistance.

11:38.735 --> 11:42.364
Our hands touched,
there was a sudden spark of electricity,

11:42.699 --> 11:45.497
and, as if by magic, the gates parted.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.780
- We took it as a sign.
- You were meant to be together.

11:49.086 --> 11:52.874
Yes. We were married
just three short years later.

11:53.217 --> 11:56.254
Look at this. It's beautiful.

11:56.556 --> 11:59.832
It's a glockenspiel. We bought it
on our honeymoon in Zurich.

12:00.146 --> 12:03.183
I brought it down from the attic
to remind Maris of better times.

12:03.484 --> 12:08.717
It used to play beautiful music -
now it doesn't. How's that for irony?

12:09.119 --> 12:11.679
Let's get you dry clothes, so you can

12:11.956 --> 12:14.914
make dinner
and get home for your date.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.601
(Sobs)

12:18.759 --> 12:21.193
Daphne?

12:22.724 --> 12:25.522
- What is it?
- Nothing.

12:25.812 --> 12:29.646
No, no. I'm a psychiatrist -
I can read the signs.

12:29.986 --> 12:34.184
I'm sorry. I didn't want to spoil
your reunion with Mrs Crane,

12:34.535 --> 12:37.652
but...Eric broke up with me.

12:38.876 --> 12:40.867
- He did?
- Yes.

12:41.129 --> 12:44.166
He said he couldn't
commit to me and his music.

12:44.469 --> 12:47.905
He had to stay focussed.
I know it was an excuse.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.455
I've heard his music.

12:52.022 --> 12:56.300
- He must have another girl.
- Oh... Oh, oh, oh!

12:57.615 --> 13:02.484
He's a fool. If he can't appreciate you,
you're better off without him.

13:02.874 --> 13:07.789
Right now, I'm not so sure,
but thank you, Dr Crane.

13:08.174 --> 13:09.846
(Phone)

13:13.558 --> 13:16.595
Niles Crane. Oh, Maris!

13:17.898 --> 13:19.650
Where...where are you?

13:21.279 --> 13:23.235
What d'you mean
you can't come home?

13:23.491 --> 13:25.482
It's not that bad a storm.

13:25.744 --> 13:27.780
(Thunder crashes)

13:28.916 --> 13:32.704
Oh, Maris,
I really think you should come home.

13:36.387 --> 13:40.221
No, of course. I don't want you
travelling if it's not safe.

13:41.605 --> 13:44.073
Yes, I understand. See you tomorrow.

13:47.698 --> 13:50.974
Well... Seems like it's just the two of us.

13:51.287 --> 13:53.562
You mean,
Mrs Crane won't be coming?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.789
(Thunder)

13:58.674 --> 14:01.108
Oh my, there goes the electricity!

14:02.222 --> 14:04.577
What do we do now?

14:10.945 --> 14:14.733
The storm's really bad.
You shouldn't drive.

14:15.076 --> 14:18.830
You just spend the night there.
Good night, Daphne.

14:20.043 --> 14:23.513
- You told her to spend the night?
- What's the problem?

14:23.840 --> 14:28.630
- You know how Niles feels about her.
- Relax, it's just a little crush.

14:29.015 --> 14:33.054
Yes, Niles is harmless. He'd never try
anything with Maris around.

14:33.398 --> 14:35.275
Maris is in Arizona.

14:35.527 --> 14:38.485
- I got to get Daphne out of there!
- Why?

14:38.782 --> 14:43.697
It's a recipe for disaster. All alone
in a Gothic mansion on a rainy night.

14:44.082 --> 14:47.040
It only lacks someone shouting
"Heathcliff!" across the moors.

14:47.337 --> 14:49.612
- Wait!
- You're not coming.

14:49.883 --> 14:52.192
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

14:53.389 --> 14:55.903
(Passionate piano playing)

15:02.029 --> 15:06.898
- Oh, Dr Crane, you play beautifully.
- Thank you.

15:07.287 --> 15:10.040
(Dissonant chords)

15:13.047 --> 15:15.003
(Chords)

15:17.012 --> 15:20.049
I found this in the guest room.
I hope it's all right.

15:20.351 --> 15:22.660
I thought you'd put on Maris' clothes.

15:22.939 --> 15:26.056
Something bulky
from her wool collection.

15:26.361 --> 15:31.833
She's quite a bit smaller than me.
This was all I could find that fit.

15:32.245 --> 15:34.713
- Should I go look for something else?
- No... Yes.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.751
No, oh, no...

15:37.003 --> 15:39.312
(Hits keys)
Ooh!

15:40.676 --> 15:43.270
No. As long as it's big enough.

15:43.555 --> 15:46.274
And...warm enough. And...

15:46.560 --> 15:50.678
...silky enough. And...

15:51.026 --> 15:53.062
I have to make a phone call.

15:57.996 --> 16:00.590
(Phone rings)

16:01.919 --> 16:04.387
(Answering machine)
'Hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane.

16:04.674 --> 16:05.629
'I'm listening.'

16:05.842 --> 16:07.070
(Beeps)

16:07.303 --> 16:09.373
(Niles)
'Frasier, Frasier?

16:09.640 --> 16:13.553
'I'm having a little crisis here.
Actually a large crisis.

16:13.897 --> 16:17.367
'It's no time to screen calls. Damn!'

16:20.491 --> 16:22.288
- This is stupid.
- No.

16:22.536 --> 16:25.528
- Nothing will happen between them.
- What if it does?

16:25.833 --> 16:27.869
He's my brother, and he loves his wife.

16:28.129 --> 16:30.927
Their marriage
isn't everyone's cup of tea,

16:31.217 --> 16:34.812
but on some twisted, bizarre level
it works for them.

16:35.140 --> 16:39.053
If Niles hurts his marriage, he'd suffer.
I won't let him suffer.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.308
You'll miss the Roosevelt.

16:41.568 --> 16:45.243
I let you come
if you agreed not to give directions.

16:45.574 --> 16:47.326
It's just faster.

16:47.577 --> 16:51.536
- Roosevelt will add ten minutes.
- In rain, it's faster.

16:51.876 --> 16:55.664
- Spatial relationships change in rain?
- There's better traction.

16:56.008 --> 16:58.363
If you had all-weather tyres
like I told you...

16:58.638 --> 17:01.948
- Come on!
- You had to buy some German thing...

17:05.732 --> 17:08.929
We'd better make this last.
It's all that's left of the wood.

17:09.239 --> 17:10.991
(Sobs)

17:11.242 --> 17:12.993
Don't worry.

17:13.244 --> 17:18.444
If this runs out, there's an antique
sideboard that I think is reproduction.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.113
Oh, it's Eric, isn't it?

17:22.010 --> 17:24.285
Don't know why I'm being so silly.

17:24.556 --> 17:27.627
We weren't together long enough
for anything to happen.

17:29.062 --> 17:32.611
Powerful feelings can come
from the promise of what might happen.

17:32.944 --> 17:36.903
Anticipation makes all the little hairs
on your neck stand on end.

17:38.829 --> 17:41.263
(Thunder)

17:41.542 --> 17:43.612
- Dr Crane!
- Yes?

17:43.879 --> 17:46.074
- We're losing the fire.
- No, we're not.

17:46.341 --> 17:49.378
It's burning
with the heat of a thousand suns!

17:50.681 --> 17:52.876
It's down to its last embers!

17:53.144 --> 17:56.102
Well, then, I'll put some wood on it.

17:56.399 --> 17:59.152
You flooded it.

17:59.446 --> 18:02.006
You cannot flood a fuel-injected engine.

18:02.284 --> 18:06.960
This is maddening. We're so close
to the house, I can see the gargoyles.

18:07.334 --> 18:10.053
- If we'd taken Roosevelt...
- We'd be stuck there.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.899
- You made a mistake.
- That is it!

18:13.177 --> 18:15.850
Call the auto club, I'll make a dash for it.

18:17.017 --> 18:20.976
You should take the shortcut
by the side of the fountain.

18:21.315 --> 18:23.351
Same to you!

18:25.823 --> 18:29.020
I suppose I just fall in love too fast.

18:29.329 --> 18:33.242
The minute I feel that spark
I give my heart away.

18:33.585 --> 18:36.895
Daphne,
stop being so hard on yourself.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.095
What you see as a fault
is also your greatest gift -

18:40.389 --> 18:44.064
to be so open and warm and loving.

18:44.395 --> 18:47.353
You're so kind, Dr Crane.

18:47.650 --> 18:50.164
I'm glad we ended up like this tonight.

18:50.447 --> 18:52.244
So am I.

18:53.410 --> 18:58.564
It's just so nice to be with a man
you feel so comfortable with.

18:58.961 --> 19:01.680
I feel very close to you.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.764
I feel very close to you too, Daphne.

19:05.054 --> 19:07.614
It's easy being someone
you feel close to,

19:07.893 --> 19:12.728
when you feel close to someone
who's so...close.

19:13.401 --> 19:15.278
(Thunder)

19:15.530 --> 19:17.486
(Glockenspiel)

19:21.540 --> 19:24.930
Dr Crane,
your glockenspiel has sprung to life.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.508
Oh, the clock!

19:37.358 --> 19:40.156
My God, it hasn't run like this in years!

19:40.446 --> 19:42.721
Maris will be delighted!

19:46.456 --> 19:48.208
Maris!

19:50.170 --> 19:53.321
You really love her, don't you?

19:53.634 --> 19:55.750
You know, I do.

19:58.308 --> 20:02.426
Love's a funny thing, isn't it?
Sometimes it's exciting, passionate.

20:02.774 --> 20:05.846
Sometimes it's something else.

20:06.155 --> 20:08.988
Something comfortable and familiar.

20:09.286 --> 20:11.242
That newly exfoliated little face

20:11.497 --> 20:14.409
staring at you
across the breakfast table.

20:15.963 --> 20:20.479
Sharing a laugh when seeing someone
wearing white after Labour Day.

20:22.223 --> 20:25.340
I hope some day,
some man will feel that way about me.

20:25.645 --> 20:27.875
Oh! Daphne, don't worry.

20:28.859 --> 20:31.657
You are a very special person.

20:31.947 --> 20:35.383
Some day a man worthy of you
will come along.

20:35.704 --> 20:38.423
Just as soon as the gods create him.

20:38.709 --> 20:42.338
That's the loveliest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

20:42.673 --> 20:45.631
Thank you. You're a good friend.

20:47.974 --> 20:50.010
STOP!!!

20:53.817 --> 20:55.933
Frasier!

20:58.324 --> 21:02.602
- Have you gone mad? You'll regret it.
- What are you talking about?

21:02.957 --> 21:06.745
The two of you alone.
The fire, the candlelight, the nightie!

21:07.089 --> 21:10.206
Dr Crane,
you didn't think Dr Crane and I...

21:11.346 --> 21:14.702
Dr Crane! You have some nerve

21:15.018 --> 21:18.055
to imply your brother
would do anything so deplorable!!

21:18.357 --> 21:23.590
He just made a beautiful speech
about how much he loves his wife.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.189
How he cherishes
her excruciating little face.

21:27.497 --> 21:30.534
And how they laugh at white people.

21:32.046 --> 21:34.480
- That didn't sound right.
- Close enough.

21:36.053 --> 21:39.329
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to suggest...
I wasn't implying...

21:39.642 --> 21:42.440
Then what was it
you wanted us to stop doing?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.789
I wanted you to stop...uh...

21:47.071 --> 21:50.905
standing in silence!
A night like this calls for music!

21:51.245 --> 21:54.920
Daphne, wine for all of us.
Niles, join me at the piano, please.

21:57.297 --> 22:00.414
- You sure everything's all right?
- Absolutely.

22:00.719 --> 22:04.314
Frasier,
my glockenspiel is working again.

22:08.857 --> 22:11.291
(Tempestuous piano music)

22:13.114 --> 22:15.992
(# Theme music starts)

22:16.286 --> 22:18.720
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.792 --> 22:21.066
# Mercy!

22:21.294 --> 22:25.890
# Maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:27.973 --> 22:33.127
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.233 --> 22:36.383
# They're calling again #

22:36.653 --> 22:39.565
Frasier has left the building.

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
