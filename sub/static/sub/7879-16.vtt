00:34.180 --> 00:35.680
Mmm!

00:35.748 --> 00:38.016
Damn it.

00:38.083 --> 00:41.452
Mmm, this bagel is so good.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.954
It's Thomas'.

00:43.022 --> 00:44.355
They made a bagel just like...

00:44.423 --> 00:45.840
...a real New York bagel.

00:45.908 --> 00:48.159
Hey, taxi!

00:49.395 --> 00:52.380
This is the most amazing bagel.

00:52.448 --> 00:54.682
I wish I could tell
more people about it,

00:54.750 --> 00:55.683
strangers even.

00:55.751 --> 00:56.718
Why not get on Facebook?

00:56.785 --> 00:58.386
What's that?

00:58.454 --> 01:00.922
It's the Web site you go to
when you're done yanking it.

01:00.990 --> 01:03.157
Here, I'll set you up, Mom.

01:04.393 --> 01:07.195
Do people really care
what I just ate?

01:10.583 --> 01:12.817
Facebook is all
about reconnecting.

01:12.885 --> 01:14.702
Give me the name
of someone from your past.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.905
How about Kelly Wilk?

01:16.972 --> 01:18.373
No!

01:18.440 --> 01:21.242
I forbid you
to locate Kelly Wilk.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.361
Which, of course,
means I have to.

01:23.429 --> 01:25.430
Oh, my God, that's Kelly.

01:25.497 --> 01:27.482
I haven't seen her in 20 years.

01:27.566 --> 01:29.067
They called her
The Kidney Killer

01:29.134 --> 01:31.002
because she made
people party so hard,

01:31.070 --> 01:32.487
their kidneys would shut down.

01:32.554 --> 01:34.622
We used to go down
to this club called The Button

01:34.690 --> 01:36.774
and get destroyed.

01:36.842 --> 01:39.844
One time I passed out hugging
the toilet bowl,

01:39.912 --> 01:43.932
my face two inches from a turd
somebody left on the seat.

01:43.999 --> 01:45.683
Ah, I miss it.

01:45.751 --> 01:46.884
I know The Button.

01:46.952 --> 01:50.004
I used to cruise and
sell ecstasy there.

01:50.072 --> 01:52.173
You know, I created ecstasy.

01:52.241 --> 01:54.158
You didn't create
ecstasy, Roger.

01:54.226 --> 01:55.543
I did too create ecstasy.

01:55.611 --> 01:56.544
I'll prove it.

01:56.612 --> 01:57.979
Klaus, my files.

01:58.047 --> 02:01.182
I am not your secretary.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.184
Now I am.

02:11.894 --> 02:13.728
Nonsense.

02:14.947 --> 02:17.165
Excuse me.

02:25.741 --> 02:27.809
Mom, Kelly lives
in D.C.

02:27.876 --> 02:28.977
You should friend her.

02:29.044 --> 02:30.178
Do not friend her.

02:30.245 --> 02:31.245
Kelly is too wild.

02:31.313 --> 02:32.647
No good can come of it.

02:32.715 --> 02:35.083
Come on, let Mom have
some fun once in a while.

02:35.150 --> 02:36.718
Why don't you ever
take my side?

02:36.785 --> 02:38.319
Because your side
is always wrong.

02:38.387 --> 02:39.354
<i>Your</i> side is always wrong.

02:39.421 --> 02:40.405
Ow!

02:40.472 --> 02:42.273
Ha-ha,
can't get me.

02:44.076 --> 02:47.045
Come on, Mom, it might be fun
to reconnect after 20 years.

02:47.112 --> 02:49.330
Sure, I'm game.

Party till you puke!

03:04.897 --> 03:07.432
Kelly, you crazy...

03:07.499 --> 03:09.067
Francine.

03:09.134 --> 03:10.301
...nun!

03:10.369 --> 03:12.170
Sister Wilk, actually.

03:12.237 --> 03:13.838
As it says in Leviticus...

03:13.906 --> 03:16.791
Ah, I don't know what the
 it says in Leviticus!

03:16.859 --> 03:18.026
I'm just messing with you!

03:18.093 --> 03:23.031
Oh, you crazy tramp.
You haven't changed a bit.

03:23.098 --> 03:24.766
Oh, Kelly, this is
my daughter Hayley.

03:24.833 --> 03:25.767
Nice to meet you.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.035
What's your tattoo say?

03:27.102 --> 03:29.137
"Eat out more often."

03:29.204 --> 03:31.506
Hey, what do you say we
grab some drinks? I'm in.

03:31.573 --> 03:33.474
Hayley, you think you can hang?

03:33.542 --> 03:35.276
Oh, trust me, I can hang.

03:35.344 --> 03:36.577
Whoo-hoo!

03:36.645 --> 03:38.980
Hey, you want to see
a real Pontiac Fiero?

03:39.048 --> 03:40.398
You still have that?

03:40.466 --> 03:42.533
Yeah, it's my good luck car.

03:42.601 --> 03:45.136
I've only gotten 19 DUIs in it.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.441
One, two, three!

03:50.509 --> 03:53.061
Ooh.

03:53.128 --> 03:55.363
Francine, you raised
a lightweight.

03:55.431 --> 03:57.331
Bistore!

03:57.399 --> 03:59.283
Bistore.

04:02.554 --> 04:03.905
Oh, no.

04:03.972 --> 04:06.808
That's right--
Ultimate Kellys.

04:06.875 --> 04:07.842
What's, what's in it?

04:07.910 --> 04:09.360
Don't worry about it.

04:09.428 --> 04:12.029
Let's just say it's why
Montel Williams has M.S.

04:14.566 --> 04:16.416
Honey, you sit this one out.

04:16.485 --> 04:18.769
They don't call her
The Kidney Killer for nothing.

04:18.837 --> 04:21.789
No, I'm, I'm fine, I can hang.

I can't take it anymore, Joe.

04:43.862 --> 04:46.063
I'm, I'm shutting down.

04:52.471 --> 04:55.506
I'll always remember
that trip we took to the anus.

04:57.709 --> 04:58.843
No!

04:58.911 --> 05:00.711
I can't make it alone.

05:07.152 --> 05:09.754
My insides hurt.

05:15.310 --> 05:17.128
What happened?

05:17.196 --> 05:19.647
Oh, Stan, we were out
having a drink with Kelly

05:19.715 --> 05:22.550
and one
of Hayley's kidneys died,

05:22.618 --> 05:25.153
and her other kidney is failing.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.888
She's going to need
a transplant.

05:26.955 --> 05:28.623
Oh, my God.

05:28.690 --> 05:31.192
I'd give her mine,
but I only have one.

05:31.260 --> 05:32.493
Kelly killed my other one

05:32.561 --> 05:34.595
when we had
a tequila-pounding contest

05:34.663 --> 05:37.398
with comedian George Wallace,
who went on to become

05:37.466 --> 05:40.067
the second most famous black man
in a Kangol hat.

05:40.135 --> 05:41.302
Who's the first most famous?

05:41.370 --> 05:43.070
Samuel L. Jackson.

05:43.138 --> 05:46.140
Then I guess I'll have
to give her one of my kidneys.

05:46.208 --> 05:49.977
Or... we could
leave her hooked up

05:50.045 --> 05:51.646
to a machine her whole life,

05:51.713 --> 05:53.698
like me and my coffeemaker,
I tell you what.

05:53.765 --> 05:54.715
What are you talking about?

05:54.783 --> 05:56.000
She's my daughter.

05:56.068 --> 05:57.285
I'm giving her my kidney.

05:57.352 --> 05:58.402
I'm ready.

05:58.470 --> 05:59.921
Somebody shave my groin.

06:00.005 --> 06:01.539
I like it against the grain.

06:01.590 --> 06:05.109
Stan, wait, I don't know
if you'll be a match.

06:05.177 --> 06:06.277
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

06:06.345 --> 06:07.512
Why wouldn't I be a match?

06:07.579 --> 06:10.548
Well...

06:10.616 --> 06:12.650
there's a chance
you're not Hayley's father.

06:19.539 --> 06:23.806
I... might not be
Hayley's father?

06:23.873 --> 06:25.341
You cheated on me?

06:25.408 --> 06:26.809
I'm sorry.

06:26.876 --> 06:28.844
It happened a few days
before our wedding

06:28.912 --> 06:30.646
at my bachelorette party.

06:30.714 --> 06:32.948
A few days before the wedding?!

06:33.016 --> 06:34.750
While I was dealing
with small details

06:34.818 --> 06:35.901
that ultimately made it

06:35.986 --> 06:38.020
the most beautiful day
of my life?

06:38.088 --> 06:41.190
A box of
flip-flops so the girls could dance.

06:41.257 --> 06:44.193
I was freaking out that
my life was changing.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.295
I was going from
being this party girl

06:46.363 --> 06:50.783
to being someone's wife,
and I got drunk and--

06:50.850 --> 06:53.919
oh, it was the biggest
mistake I ever made.

06:53.987 --> 06:57.656
Can you ever forgive me?

06:57.724 --> 07:00.959
You big whore.

07:01.027 --> 07:02.928
I don't know why
I'm holding you like this.

07:02.996 --> 07:04.997
It must be very confusing.

07:05.065 --> 07:06.665
Mr. and Mrs.
Smith, bad news.

07:06.733 --> 07:09.735
Your daughter's second kidney
is only working at 20%.

07:09.803 --> 07:12.705
If it fails, she dies.

07:12.772 --> 07:15.140
Hayley will likely need
a kidney transplant.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.408
Well, I may not be compatible

07:16.476 --> 07:17.643
because right before
our wedding,

07:17.711 --> 07:19.995
my wife had warm-up sex
with another man.

07:20.063 --> 07:21.830
I can test to see if
you're her father,

07:21.898 --> 07:23.999
but it'll take a few days.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.634
Your insurance is terrible.

07:25.702 --> 07:27.503
It won't pay for us to
overnight your samples

07:27.570 --> 07:31.206
to the lab in Dallas, so
we'll have to use Robby.

07:31.274 --> 07:33.242
I'm Robby!

07:33.309 --> 07:35.544
I'm not allowed to stay
up and watch <i>Castle!</i>

07:37.113 --> 07:39.048
In the meantime, you'd better
track down the other man

07:39.115 --> 07:42.885
you slept with, in case
your daughter needs that kidney.

07:42.952 --> 07:44.253
So who is he, Francine?

07:44.320 --> 07:45.888
I'm not sure.

07:45.955 --> 07:50.059
Just someone I m in a bar and
had sex with in the coat room.

07:50.126 --> 07:53.128
You had sex with a stranger
in the coat room?

07:53.196 --> 07:54.696
Coat room sex, huh?

07:54.764 --> 07:58.467
Did you take off his
pants and jacket?

07:58.535 --> 08:01.236
Ah...!

08:01.304 --> 08:03.505
My grandmother's here.

08:03.573 --> 08:06.341
She's dying.

08:06.409 --> 08:07.376
Stan, I know you're upset.

08:07.444 --> 08:08.811
Upset?

08:08.878 --> 08:10.112
I'm just now finding out

08:10.180 --> 08:11.980
my daughter
might not even be mine.

08:12.048 --> 08:13.148
I can't believe it.

08:13.216 --> 08:14.850
I mean, I changed her diapers,

08:14.918 --> 08:16.769
I fed her, I clothed her,
I got her braces,

08:16.836 --> 08:18.570
I sent her to college.

08:18.638 --> 08:21.273
Holy , that guy
owes me so much money.

08:21.341 --> 08:23.509
Hold on, Stan,
there's a good chance

08:23.576 --> 08:25.043
Hayley <i>is</i> your daughter.

08:25.111 --> 08:28.113
You and I had sex three
days after I was with him.

08:28.181 --> 08:29.715
No, no, this all makes sense.

08:29.783 --> 08:31.984
I can't believe
I never saw it before.

08:32.051 --> 08:34.919
Hayley and I have never agreed
on a single thing:

08:34.988 --> 08:37.789
the environment, health care,
favorite fast food mascot.

08:37.857 --> 08:39.691
I say the Hamburglar
because he's an outlaw

08:39.759 --> 08:40.926
and that's sexy as hell.

08:40.994 --> 08:42.361
I don't remember
what Hayley said,

08:42.445 --> 08:44.429
but it wasn't the Hamburglar,
so I didn't listen.

08:44.497 --> 08:46.899
When I was a kid
we called him the Ham-booger.

08:46.966 --> 08:49.935
Stan, come on, we have to
find out who this guy is,

08:50.003 --> 08:52.588
just in case she
needs his kidney.

08:52.655 --> 08:53.989
Fine.

08:54.057 --> 08:56.658
Honey, I'm sorry
about all this.

08:56.726 --> 08:59.711
Can you find it in your
heart to forgive me?

09:01.247 --> 09:04.933
No, the Devil sent you
into my life to destroy it.

09:05.001 --> 09:06.502
You make me sick.

09:06.569 --> 09:07.836
I'm starting to think

09:07.904 --> 09:14.576
my body language could
use some improvement.

09:14.644 --> 09:16.912
Says here on your
mom's Facebook page

09:16.980 --> 09:18.514
that Hayley's kidneys
have failed.

09:18.581 --> 09:19.982
Goodness!

09:20.049 --> 09:22.985
Her next update says your dad
might not be Hayley's father.

09:23.052 --> 09:24.686
Six people "like" this.

09:24.754 --> 09:26.822
So, that leaves you as
the next logical donor.

09:26.890 --> 09:27.923
Oh.

09:27.991 --> 09:29.858
You know how
they take kidneys out?

09:29.926 --> 09:30.926
No.

09:30.994 --> 09:32.928
You'll walk into your room

09:32.996 --> 09:35.664
and there will be plastic sheets
all over the floor.

09:35.731 --> 09:39.618
Before you can react, a man in a
ski mask will tie you to a chair

09:39.702 --> 09:43.422
with an Indian braided belt he
got on vacation in Santa Fe.

09:43.506 --> 09:46.542
He'll turn on some Huey Lewis,
and then cut the damn thing out

09:46.593 --> 09:48.577
with a rusty keyhole saw.

09:48.628 --> 09:49.678
No antiseptic.

09:49.745 --> 09:50.512
No novocaine.

09:50.580 --> 09:51.847
No nothing.

09:51.914 --> 09:54.016
Just the song "Hip to Be Square"

09:54.083 --> 09:56.602
drowning out
your boyish screams.

10:06.112 --> 10:08.046
Now no one has anything.

10:10.750 --> 10:14.469
Computer, locate all the male
patrons who were at The Button

10:14.537 --> 10:17.139
in Crane's Creek three nights
before my wedding.

10:17.207 --> 10:20.142
Researching.
Researching.

10:20.210 --> 10:21.393
Zero results.

10:21.461 --> 10:23.111
Oh come on, run it again.

10:23.179 --> 10:25.280
You're a half-billion-dollar
super computer!

10:25.348 --> 10:27.783
What do we do?
What do I say?

10:27.850 --> 10:31.053
Just say something, we're
gonna lose the money!

10:31.120 --> 10:33.222
Up-- update!

10:33.289 --> 10:35.524
Updating iTunes.

10:46.019 --> 10:47.452
Where did this come from?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.221
We finally figured
out time travel.

10:49.289 --> 10:51.556
Hmm.

10:51.624 --> 10:54.493
This could come into play with
what's going on in my life.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.445
Come on, boy.
Who wants a carrot?

10:58.314 --> 11:00.415
Why are you so mean to me?

11:00.483 --> 11:03.118
All I want to do is ride you
to McDonald's.

11:05.755 --> 11:07.456
Okay, we're ready.

11:07.523 --> 11:10.325
All right, we're just gonna find
the guy I slept with,

11:10.393 --> 11:12.661
get his name,
and then look him up in

11:12.712 --> 11:14.630
the present in case
Hayley needs his kidney.

11:14.697 --> 11:16.581
I can't wait to give
this jerk the bill

11:16.649 --> 11:18.317
for what it cost me
to raise her.

11:18.384 --> 11:20.619
The only thing
I'm not charging him for

11:20.687 --> 11:22.220
is circus camp.
That was my idea.

11:22.305 --> 11:23.805
I was trying to live
vicariously through her.

11:23.856 --> 11:25.274
That's on me.

11:25.341 --> 11:27.643
But does that really
make me a bad guy,

11:27.710 --> 11:29.578
wanting my daughter
to be in <i>Cavalia,</i>

11:29.646 --> 11:31.897
the greatest show
Larry King's ever seen?

11:31.965 --> 11:34.349
And don't forget,
you absolutely have

11:34.417 --> 11:36.184
to transport back by midnight.

11:36.252 --> 11:38.620
What happens if we don't get
back before midnight?

11:38.688 --> 11:40.238
Duper made it back
at 12:02.

11:41.524 --> 11:43.608
I did it, though.

11:43.676 --> 11:45.744
I took a way better
high school photo.

11:53.336 --> 11:55.971
Keep your eyes peeled
for your younger self.

11:56.039 --> 11:57.706
She'll lead us
right to the guy.

12:00.543 --> 12:03.061
Oh, remember this place, Stan?

12:03.146 --> 12:05.380
Right over there
I slipped on a Beanie Baby

12:05.431 --> 12:06.648
and tore my flannel shirt,

12:06.716 --> 12:08.383
'cause it was
the '90s, you see.

12:08.434 --> 12:09.985
I don't want
to reminisce with you.

12:10.052 --> 12:11.320
Let's just find this guy,

12:11.387 --> 12:13.105
get his name
and get out of here.

12:13.189 --> 12:14.323
Look! There you are!

12:14.390 --> 12:17.175
To Madonna,
a wonderful person who will

12:17.243 --> 12:20.312
never become a ghoulish mummy
with bird-like appendages!

12:21.848 --> 12:23.498
I gotta say, Francine,

12:23.566 --> 12:26.018
I'm really surprised
you're getting married.

12:26.085 --> 12:28.503
Yeah, but when you find
the right person...

12:28.571 --> 12:30.555
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:30.623 --> 12:31.857
Think about it.

12:31.924 --> 12:34.459
The same guy, the same thing,
day after day,

12:34.544 --> 12:38.647
year after year until you die.

12:38.715 --> 12:40.349
Oh, God!

12:44.754 --> 12:47.723
Come on.
You're not married yet!

12:47.790 --> 12:49.791
And neither am I!

12:49.859 --> 12:53.395
Hey, who wants to see
if my Valtrex is working?!

12:55.732 --> 12:56.898
That must be him!

12:56.966 --> 12:58.300
He doesn't look
like anything special.

12:58.368 --> 13:01.136
I remember him being
super smooth.

13:01.204 --> 13:03.138
Baby, would you like
to sit down?

13:03.206 --> 13:05.323
Here, let me wipe
your seat off for you.

13:06.459 --> 13:08.060
Bah!

13:10.229 --> 13:12.397
There I am, taking him
to the coatroom.

13:12.465 --> 13:14.533
Let's get his name
and get out of here.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.269
Fine. I'll pick his pocket and
look at his driver's license.

13:18.488 --> 13:19.821
...and then I add
candied almonds

13:19.889 --> 13:21.990
and sprinkle it
with some blue cheese.

13:22.058 --> 13:24.226
Sounds like a really
good salad.

13:24.293 --> 13:26.261
Yeah, it's the best salad ever.

13:26.329 --> 13:27.829
So do you wanna have
sex with me or...

13:27.897 --> 13:28.997
I don't know.

13:29.065 --> 13:31.533
I got a lot of salads
to think up.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.375
Stop watching.
Just get the wallet.

13:40.443 --> 13:41.843
You're so into it!

13:41.911 --> 13:43.545
Oh, I see you have no problem

13:43.613 --> 13:45.213
kissing <i>him</i> there
without a shower!

13:45.281 --> 13:46.782
Shh!

13:53.156 --> 13:54.456
His name is Joel Larsen.

13:54.524 --> 13:56.158
Great. Let's go!

13:56.225 --> 13:58.727
A down payment for all
the night retainers she lost.

14:08.471 --> 14:10.939
Mmm, that's nice.

14:11.007 --> 14:12.407
That is <i>not</i> nice, young lady!

14:12.475 --> 14:14.176
You are getting
married in three days!

14:14.243 --> 14:15.694
What do you think you're doing?

14:15.761 --> 14:17.696
Not tucking my tank top
into my underwear,

14:17.763 --> 14:18.814
that's for sure.

14:18.881 --> 14:20.682
So weird.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.186
You remind me of my fiancé,
but much older and fatter.

14:24.253 --> 14:26.822
Look, in the future there's
a place called Jamba Juice

14:26.873 --> 14:29.691
and they make you think it's healthy,
but it just makes you fat.

14:29.759 --> 14:32.194
I don't know
what I was thinking!

14:32.261 --> 14:33.278
I can't do this!

14:33.346 --> 14:35.063
Thanks a lot, jerk.

14:35.131 --> 14:37.532
Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-
bluh-bluh-bluh... blocked!

14:39.452 --> 14:41.136
Stan, what the hell
did you do?!

14:41.204 --> 14:42.504
I couldn't just watch that!

14:42.572 --> 14:44.039
Besides, what are you
so mad about?

14:44.106 --> 14:45.474
That I broke up
your little humpfest?

14:45.541 --> 14:47.576
Yes, exactly!

14:47.643 --> 14:49.611
Because if that guy
is Hayley's father,

14:49.679 --> 14:53.682
then Hayley will no
longer exist in the present!

14:53.749 --> 14:56.651
Oh. Right.

14:56.719 --> 14:59.187
Look at you,
understanding time travel.

14:59.255 --> 15:00.622
We have to fix this!

15:00.690 --> 15:02.657
We have to get young me

15:02.725 --> 15:04.926
to sleep with that
guy by midnight.

15:04.994 --> 15:07.696
That's right, Stan,
you gotta get me laid!

15:07.763 --> 15:10.332
I think I can help you
with that.

15:10.399 --> 15:12.300
Coat dwarf!

15:12.368 --> 15:13.835
I forgot what a problem

15:13.903 --> 15:16.137
coat dwarfs were in the '90s.

15:21.702 --> 15:23.036
Where'd your friend
Francine go?!

15:23.103 --> 15:25.271
She has to have sex
with that guy over there!

15:25.339 --> 15:28.107
Bah!

15:28.175 --> 15:29.609
She got upset over something

15:29.677 --> 15:31.711
and went
to her fiancé's apartment.

15:31.779 --> 15:33.346
Hey, you kind of look like him,

15:33.414 --> 15:35.315
except older and fatter.

15:35.382 --> 15:37.250
In the future,
you live in a cheap motel

15:37.318 --> 15:39.719
and drive a Pontiac Fiero.

15:39.787 --> 15:41.788
I get a Pontiac Fiero?!

15:44.558 --> 15:49.162
I almost made the
biggest mistake of my life.

15:49.230 --> 15:50.597
The important thing is

15:50.664 --> 15:52.232
that you didn't go
through with it.

15:55.736 --> 15:57.103
Don't freak out!

15:57.171 --> 15:58.671
Who, who are you?

15:58.739 --> 16:01.574
We're you...
from the future.

16:01.642 --> 16:03.459
How is that possible?!

16:03.527 --> 16:07.030
I know it sounds crazy,
but we can explain everything.

16:07.097 --> 16:09.432
And through expanding
the wormhole,

16:09.500 --> 16:11.601
we were able
to transport into the past.

16:11.669 --> 16:13.770
So... time travel?

16:13.837 --> 16:15.138
Like <i>Back to the Future?</i>

16:15.205 --> 16:16.673
Oh, yeah,
<i>Back to the Future</i> came out.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.341
I could've just said
"like <i>Back to the Future."</i>

16:20.377 --> 16:21.277
Okay, we believe you.

16:21.345 --> 16:22.779
So you're in?

16:22.846 --> 16:25.648
You expect me to help my fiancée
have sex with a stranger?

16:25.716 --> 16:27.550
In public, unprotected, yes.

16:27.618 --> 16:29.953
I'm done drinking
and fooling around.

16:30.020 --> 16:32.822
I'm not sleeping with
anyone except my Stan!

16:32.890 --> 16:34.474
But you have to!

16:34.541 --> 16:36.910
Well, if she <i>is</i> my daughter,
then she'll exist,

16:36.977 --> 16:39.028
and if she's not my daughter,
why would I care?

16:39.096 --> 16:41.497
Because...

16:41.582 --> 16:44.483
Because you're me and we put so
much time into her.

16:44.535 --> 16:47.120
You're gonna feed her, and sing
to her when she's sick,

16:47.171 --> 16:49.756
and, and go to her school plays,
and buy her bunnies

16:49.823 --> 16:52.008
and run over her bunnies
and buy her new bunnies

16:52.092 --> 16:53.426
before she finds out.

16:53.493 --> 16:56.930
Sure, she's a pain in the ass,
but we raised her.

16:56.997 --> 16:59.098
So regardless of who her
biological father is,

16:59.166 --> 17:02.268
she's our daughter,
and she deserves to exist!

17:03.954 --> 17:05.421
That all may be true,

17:05.489 --> 17:07.624
but there's nothing
on this planet

17:07.691 --> 17:09.025
that could get me wasted enough

17:09.093 --> 17:10.526
to sleep with that guy.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.661
I'm sorry.

17:11.729 --> 17:13.296
Roger that.

17:14.498 --> 17:16.065
Roger!

17:21.972 --> 17:23.388
Elian?

17:23.457 --> 17:25.023
Is that you, baby?

17:25.092 --> 17:26.826
Come on in. You're safe here.

17:26.894 --> 17:28.728
I will not send you back
to Coo-ba.

17:28.796 --> 17:30.413
Dr. Ya Ya?

17:30.497 --> 17:32.598
We'd like to talk to you
about getting some ecstasy.

17:32.666 --> 17:34.000
What do you know about ecstasy?

17:34.068 --> 17:35.668
Only that you created it.

17:35.736 --> 17:38.271
I'm trying to create it,
me and my roommate Dave.

17:40.374 --> 17:42.375
We're very close
to cracking the formula.

17:42.443 --> 17:45.144
We have the MDM,
but we're missing something.

17:47.581 --> 17:50.249
Of course!
Amphetamine!

17:50.317 --> 17:52.085
The missing ingredient!

17:52.152 --> 17:53.086
That's my stationery.

17:53.153 --> 17:55.054
My handwriting?

17:55.122 --> 17:57.724
How did you get this?
Who are you?

17:57.791 --> 17:59.392
We're time travelers
from the future.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.327
Now, I'm sure you have
a lot of questions...

18:01.395 --> 18:02.462
Nope, I'm good.

18:02.529 --> 18:04.163
We only have until midnight!

18:04.231 --> 18:06.749
Tell us where we can get
some amphetamines!

18:06.834 --> 18:11.838
Dave's been partying
for four days straight.

18:11.905 --> 18:13.122
He's a great artist.

18:13.207 --> 18:15.708
He painted the painting
you see behind me.

18:15.776 --> 18:18.428
Let's see what we have, some
downers, yellow jackets,

18:18.512 --> 18:21.764
a Tinkerbell keychain
which I will hold onto...

18:21.832 --> 18:24.467
Ah! Here we go!
Amphetamines!

18:30.040 --> 18:31.574
Oh, my God!

18:31.642 --> 18:35.378
I have such a feeling
of euphoria!

18:35.446 --> 18:38.614
I, I... Glow stick dance!

18:40.034 --> 18:41.951
Dave, look at me!

18:42.036 --> 18:45.838
Our years of research have
finally paid off!

18:45.906 --> 18:48.524
This will make your younger self
totally uninhibited.

18:48.592 --> 18:51.044
How can I ever repay you?

18:51.111 --> 18:53.446
Someday I'll call on
you for a favor.

18:53.497 --> 18:55.064
Cryptic!

19:02.089 --> 19:04.757
And there's the guy.

19:04.825 --> 19:07.293
Damn...
you're fine...

19:07.361 --> 19:09.896
Why you so fine...?

19:11.965 --> 19:13.533
You gotta go sleep
with that girl, bro.

19:15.652 --> 19:18.154
She's getting married.
She's not interested.

19:18.222 --> 19:19.722
We drugged her.
She's good to go!

19:19.790 --> 19:21.357
Noice!

19:28.515 --> 19:31.217
FYI, the Giants win
the Super Bowl.

19:31.285 --> 19:32.852
I'm not sure which year,

19:32.920 --> 19:35.288
so just bet everything
you have every year.

19:35.339 --> 19:38.758
Stan, we've gotta go!
It's 11:57!

19:38.825 --> 19:40.877
Oh, and hey...

19:40.944 --> 19:43.279
at some point in the future,
you're gonna try

19:43.347 --> 19:45.782
to squat 300 pounds at the gym,
and it's too much,

19:45.849 --> 19:47.416
and you're gonna blow out
your sphincter, bro,

19:47.484 --> 19:49.252
in front of all these gym dudes.

19:49.319 --> 19:51.154
The paramedics have
to cut your pants off,

19:51.221 --> 19:53.689
and it looks like you're casing
sausage out of your butt.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.057
Just, just don't do it.

20:02.199 --> 20:03.232
Hey!

20:03.317 --> 20:05.751
Aw, Duper, you got in my sock!

20:09.857 --> 20:11.474
Sorry it took so long.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.110
I found out my girlfriend I'm
living with is a prostitute!

20:14.178 --> 20:15.545
It's pretty heavy stuff, man!

20:15.612 --> 20:17.480
Shut it!

20:17.548 --> 20:19.482
Mr. Smith,
your results are in.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.285
No, Doc, I want you
to take out my kidney

20:22.352 --> 20:24.320
regardless of what it says
inside that envelope.

20:24.388 --> 20:25.955
My kidney
or Joel Larsen's kidney,

20:26.023 --> 20:27.757
one of them will be a match.

20:27.825 --> 20:30.209
I don't want to know
which one you use.

20:30.277 --> 20:32.812
She's my daughter,
no matter what.

20:36.012 --> 20:37.725
Mr. Smith, just curious.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.685
How did you get
the other kidney?

20:39.805 --> 20:40.939
I called in a favor.
