WEBVTT

00:09.460 --> 00:11.086
They infiltrated
the intelligence services

00:11.110 --> 00:12.460
to act on their behalf.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.330
Their key contact
is Amanda Jones.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.379
I need to know
what's gonna happen.

00:16.420 --> 00:19.250
- Nathan, my name is on there.
- However this thing

00:19.300 --> 00:22.600
plays itself out,
it is now toxic.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.130
Clarke and Toumi are a threat

00:24.170 --> 00:26.740
to the operation in Mali, sir.

00:26.780 --> 00:28.650
I've been accused... of, uh,

00:28.700 --> 00:31.000
- harassment.
- I fucked my own career

00:31.050 --> 00:33.830
for this.
My wife's career.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.620
What did Kingsley say?

00:35.660 --> 00:36.946
I'm seeing him again
this afternoon.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.320
What does that mean for me?

00:38.360 --> 00:42.150
I always figured you
for more than an errand boy.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.280
They'll wait
for him to be sworn in

00:48.330 --> 00:49.850
and then they'll come for you.

00:49.890 --> 00:53.290
You give us your contact
who supplied the arms.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.380
KMPH is selling
service contracts

00:59.420 --> 01:01.030
to its rival, Seracom.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.209
- Seracom paid Miller's ransom, right?
- Right.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.780
Unpack those boxes.
This isn't over.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.070 --> 01:42.640
Sir, sir.

01:54.610 --> 01:57.790
Colonel Russell,
how many have we lost?

01:57.830 --> 01:59.310
Twenty-two.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.960
- Jesus.
- This is just the beginning.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.010
Now these guys
have something to shoot at,

02:04.050 --> 02:05.970
it's gonna get
a whole lot worse.

02:12.410 --> 02:13.930
Al Moctar?

02:14.850 --> 02:16.540
Fled before the battle.

02:16.590 --> 02:19.200
- What about Clarke and Toumi?
- You were right.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.460
He was protecting them.
Gave them a vehicle.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.810
Last seen,
they were headed southwest.

02:23.860 --> 02:24.940
Thank you.

02:24.990 --> 02:27.690
Hey, man, thanks.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.730
Brandon?

02:29.770 --> 02:31.730
What are you doing here?

02:31.780 --> 02:33.210
Miller sent me.

02:33.260 --> 02:34.780
Since when do you report to him?

02:34.820 --> 02:36.260
He didn't tell you I was coming?

02:39.040 --> 02:40.870
Wait here.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.840
- Are you shutting me out?
- I thought you could

02:50.880 --> 02:52.750
- use the support.
- He's Agency, Nate.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.190
You go through me.

02:57.850 --> 02:59.330
Should I be worried?

02:59.370 --> 03:02.240
Amanda, I'm just trying

03:02.290 --> 03:03.720
to help you out.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.770
Don't get paranoid on me.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.380
I got to go.

04:36.420 --> 04:39.600
Hitch your wagon to mine,
hurtling toward the precipice.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.170
Don't be so dramatic.

04:44.170 --> 04:46.000
I hear Senator Garcia is hiring.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.560
Will you stop?

04:50.090 --> 04:54.140
Why are KMPH dumping assets?

04:54.180 --> 04:56.880
They just won a whole bunch
of military contracts,

04:56.920 --> 04:59.180
now they're selling them
to Seracom?

05:00.530 --> 05:02.930
Maybe the two companies
are connected.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.230
2003, KMPH won a whole bunch

05:06.280 --> 05:08.320
of no-bid contracts in Iraq.

05:08.370 --> 05:11.630
Hospitals, water plants,
oil infrastructure.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.070
Man on the ground in Baghdad
was William Kingsley.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.900
Wait. Um...

05:17.940 --> 05:19.470
um...

05:19.510 --> 05:23.770
Nathan Miller was a case officer
in Baghdad, same time.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.040
You think they met?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.860
Possible.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.220
2006, the Feds investigated KMPH

05:30.260 --> 05:32.090
over the Iraq contracts.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.700
Ah, nothing came of it.

05:36.310 --> 05:39.400
The lawyer who represented them
was Nicole Auster.

05:40.830 --> 05:42.840
Auster was her maiden name.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.710
She married...

05:44.750 --> 05:46.840
Nathan Miller.

05:48.490 --> 05:50.670
You got everything?

05:50.710 --> 05:53.190
Daddy, you already asked me
that, like, a thousand times.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.500
- You got everything?
- You got everything?

05:55.550 --> 05:58.290
You're being so annoying
right now.

05:58.330 --> 06:01.990
- Hey, sweetie.
- We watched Charlie Chaplin. The Kid.

06:02.030 --> 06:03.966
I bet her five dollars
that she couldn't sit through

06:03.990 --> 06:05.560
a silent movie.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.210
- She cried.
- I did not.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.470
- Yes, you did. You cried.
- Maybe I did.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.430
Hey, it's good you're running
bets, I like that.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.000
Some things never change.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.350
I love you.

06:15.390 --> 06:16.610
I love you, too, Daddy.

06:16.650 --> 06:17.650
There you go.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.660
- Thanks.
- Mm.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.400
- Oh, her, uh, school bag.
- Oh.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.750
Uh, we finished her homework.

06:25.790 --> 06:28.490
Look at you, Mr. Organized.

06:28.530 --> 06:30.100
- Yeah.
- Hey.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.930
You never did her homework.

06:31.970 --> 06:34.280
- That's not true.
- Um...

06:34.320 --> 06:36.500
Okay, yeah.

06:36.540 --> 06:38.110
Yeah, that's... that is true.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.550
You're so like her.

06:41.590 --> 06:43.640
She's like you, I don't know.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.030
Yeah.

06:50.690 --> 06:52.380
Hey, what if, um...

06:55.340 --> 06:57.000
What if I got out?

06:59.090 --> 07:00.480
If I retired?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.480
- Nate.
- Nic, I don't want to be

07:02.530 --> 07:04.570
a weekend dad.

07:04.610 --> 07:07.440
I don't.

07:07.490 --> 07:10.100
I want to come home.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.750
Look, I know that
I need to do better.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.540
I know that.

07:15.580 --> 07:19.190
I'm not asking you
for an answer right now.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.760
I'm just asking
for your permission to try.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.380
I need some time, Nate.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.730
But you're not saying no?

07:31.770 --> 07:34.470
- No.
- You are, you're saying no.

07:34.510 --> 07:36.780
No.

07:36.820 --> 07:38.820
No, I'm not saying no.

07:38.870 --> 07:42.220
Ah.
No, you're not saying no.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.610
Yeah.
I'm gonna shut up now.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.830
This is me shutting up.

07:47.870 --> 07:49.880
Shutting it.

08:04.890 --> 08:06.330
Where are we going?

08:09.640 --> 08:11.290
I'm gonna find the contact.

08:15.730 --> 08:17.430
Look, you don't
have to come with me.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.520
Either of you.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.520
I can get you across the border,
you'll be safe, but...

08:23.610 --> 08:24.960
I'm-I'm doing this.

08:47.540 --> 08:50.020
Somewhere down there
is Al Moctar's contact?

08:50.070 --> 08:52.680
Yeah.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.290
How will you find him?

08:55.330 --> 08:56.940
I've got a number.

08:56.990 --> 08:58.420
Give it a call, see who answers.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.340
Except you're too far away
to see anything.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.730
Are you gonna help?

09:05.340 --> 09:07.300
I'm still here, aren't I?

09:08.390 --> 09:10.780
I'll do it.

09:10.830 --> 09:12.830
I can get closer.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.310
What?

09:18.360 --> 09:21.100
It's not like you two
can blend in.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.370
As-salaam alaikum.

09:52.090 --> 09:54.170
That's him there,
in the compound.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.570
He's got security.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.400
How do we get to him?

10:10.840 --> 10:12.240
Thank you.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.800
Meaghan.

10:13.850 --> 10:15.890
Hello, Aaron.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.590
How's Karen?

10:20.640 --> 10:21.876
Missing those day trips
with her godmother,

10:21.900 --> 10:24.470
but her godmother's
a workaholic, so...

10:24.510 --> 10:26.006
Well, you should've thought
of that before you asked me

10:26.030 --> 10:27.770
to beher godmother.

10:27.820 --> 10:30.520
How can I help?
You know I'm retiring

10:30.560 --> 10:32.276
- next month?
- I'm not asking you to prosecute.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.740
Just need an opinion.
You're familiar

10:34.780 --> 10:36.040
with Nicole Miller?

10:36.090 --> 10:37.960
Mm, crossed paths.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.870
Thought she quit practicing
to run her NGO.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.180
She did.
Her client list

10:41.220 --> 10:43.700
included a company called KMPH.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.700
- I know them.
- The SEC hit them

10:45.750 --> 10:46.920
with a subpoena in 2004

10:46.970 --> 10:49.230
under the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.

10:49.270 --> 10:51.466
They were paying off Iraqi
officials to procure contracts.

10:51.490 --> 10:54.410
Except it never went to court.

10:54.450 --> 10:56.370
KMPH attorneys
shrugged the lawsuit,

10:56.410 --> 10:59.590
claiming they were, uh,
grease payments, not bribes.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.630
- Nicole Miller represented them?
- Not that time.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.120
Conflict of interest.
Her firm were caught red-handed

11:05.160 --> 11:07.380
setting up a shell company
to route bribe money.

11:07.420 --> 11:10.120
Miller was implicated
as a defendant.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.730
- Ouch. Still, they managed to keep it out of court.
- So...

11:13.780 --> 11:17.130
what if I brought a new lawsuit?

11:17.170 --> 11:19.220
I'm scratching my head
why you're so worked up

11:19.260 --> 11:21.610
over a mid-ranking
ex D.C. lawyer

11:21.650 --> 11:24.700
and a bunch of Baghdadi bribes
from ancient history.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.220
You run out of fights to pick?

11:26.270 --> 11:28.570
Trust me, this one's worth it.

11:28.620 --> 11:31.710
Everyone was paying kickbacks
in the post-Iraq gold rush.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.970
Even so,
the technicality KMPH used

11:34.010 --> 11:36.760
to dodge the subpoena was bogus.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.540
An offshore shell company

11:38.580 --> 11:41.240
with Iraqi officials
as direct beneficiaries

11:41.280 --> 11:43.070
predating
any business transaction?

11:43.110 --> 11:45.680
There's no way that qualifies
as grease payments.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.590
Right, just-just go
with me here.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.940
If you were
to prosecute this case,

11:50.990 --> 11:52.770
where'd that leave
Nicole Miller?

11:52.820 --> 11:55.910
In the dock, sweating bullets,
guilty as sin.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.040
So I have a case?

11:59.080 --> 12:01.000
She'd do time?

12:01.040 --> 12:03.170
I'd say you want her,
you got her.

13:16.810 --> 13:19.860
Go! Go!

13:19.900 --> 13:22.990
Go! Go! Go!

13:28.910 --> 13:30.650
Drive.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.130
Who the fuck are you?

13:32.180 --> 13:33.790
Fucking drive!

13:58.070 --> 14:00.030
Keep your hands on the wheel.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.470
Okay, check in the back.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.120
See if there's any rope
or cables or something.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.910
Will this do?

14:12.960 --> 14:14.570
Yeah, perfect.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.920
You're making
a huge mistake, bro.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.220
Huge.

14:47.380 --> 14:48.950
Aicha, you wait here.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.210
Is this about cutting off
Al Moctar?

15:03.440 --> 15:04.750
You're with the translator.

15:04.790 --> 15:06.830
- I figured...
- Move.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.980
It's nothing to do
with me, mate.

15:23.030 --> 15:26.160
I'm just a grunt
following orders.

15:27.770 --> 15:30.420
Yeah, whose orders?

15:30.470 --> 15:32.900
Who were you getting
the arms from?

15:33.950 --> 15:35.520
Now, why did you have to go

15:35.560 --> 15:37.650
and ask a silly question
like that?

15:43.090 --> 15:44.700
Fuck me.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.740
Sit.

15:46.790 --> 15:48.270
You're doing this all wrong.

15:48.310 --> 15:50.660
Hmm? How's that?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.620
You should put a nail
in me first

15:52.660 --> 15:53.840
and then ask questions.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.490
Shortens the process.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.076
Then we don't have
to stretch out this whole,

15:57.100 --> 15:59.800
"I'm not going to talk,
you're gonna make me talk"

15:59.840 --> 16:01.890
torture bullshit thing.

16:01.930 --> 16:03.980
Just get it over with.

16:04.020 --> 16:05.280
It's worth a fucking try.

16:09.290 --> 16:11.550
Put down your fucking gun!

16:11.600 --> 16:12.810
Or boyfriend Clyde here

16:12.860 --> 16:16.600
is going to get a nail
in his fucking head!

16:17.780 --> 16:19.730
- Drop it!
- Okay.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.270
Okay.

16:30.310 --> 16:34.010
Now how we supposed
to fucking talk to him?

16:45.370 --> 16:47.460
Senator.
This way, please.

16:58.860 --> 17:00.080
Here.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.250
Thank you for seeing me,
Ms. Miller.

17:02.300 --> 17:03.730
Nicole, please.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.869
Take a seat.

17:06.950 --> 17:09.000
Burkina Faso.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.310
We've been creating
protected water basins,

17:11.349 --> 17:13.440
reducing the number
of infant deaths

17:13.480 --> 17:16.569
from waterborne diseases
by as much as 40%.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.359
Impressive.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.099
Thank you.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.060
Why did you quit law?

17:23.099 --> 17:24.760
Oh.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.839
I see you've been doing
your research.

17:26.890 --> 17:28.109
Just curious.

17:28.150 --> 17:30.590
No, I wasn't satisfied.

17:30.630 --> 17:31.940
I wanted to do

17:31.980 --> 17:33.720
- something more...
- Worthwhile?

17:33.760 --> 17:37.900
Right. Well,
I-I wanted to try, at least.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.470
Does it ease the conscience?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.080
I'm sorry, Senator.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.836
I assumed you were here
to lend us your support.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.470
I'm here about Tikrit.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.130
Excuse me?

17:49.170 --> 17:50.780
Akram Muhssan.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.910
The district governor
you bought out there.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.220
The deal you cut.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.270
We were building a hospital.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.960
Basra. Karbala.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.230
Lot of deals.
Lot of bribes.

18:01.270 --> 18:03.010
And they all seem to have

18:03.050 --> 18:05.800
one common denominator.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.890
You.

18:12.410 --> 18:14.460
Do I need to call my attorney?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.110
You should know.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:22.940 --> 18:24.056
- Thanks for coming.
- Course.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.820
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:26.860 --> 18:28.950
Uh, no.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.300
Do you know
Senator Meaghan Sullivan?

18:33.350 --> 18:35.870
Um, I-I'm sorry.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.740
- When you asked me to come over, I...
- Nate.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.740
- Do you know her?
- Yes, I know her.

18:39.790 --> 18:41.480
- Yes, I've come across her.
- Recently?

18:41.530 --> 18:42.920
Yes, I... Why?

18:42.960 --> 18:44.570
Wh-What...
Why is this so important?

18:44.620 --> 18:46.920
She came in to see me today.

18:46.970 --> 18:49.060
She wanted to talk about Iraq.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.280
Look at me.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.930
Tell me exactly
what she said to you.

19:04.860 --> 19:07.770
Senator Sullivan
just threatened my wife.

19:09.770 --> 19:12.340
Maybe we should
talk about this in person.

19:20.130 --> 19:22.180
Hey.

19:25.010 --> 19:27.050
Everything all right?

19:27.090 --> 19:29.400
Jessica popped by.

19:29.450 --> 19:31.530
She left you this.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.710
Did you tell her
about the complaint?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.320
Of course not.

19:38.370 --> 19:41.200
Then why was she
so concerned about me?

19:43.460 --> 19:45.460
She knew something was up
is all.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.730
She let it slip.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.030
You're still working on it.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.470
What-Whatever it was
that threatened my career...

19:56.520 --> 19:59.080
You are still working on it.

19:59.130 --> 20:01.480
- You lied.
- I didn't lie.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.780
Oh, okay, so,
you didn't tell me the truth.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.960
You told me not to cave.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.220
You told me not to back down.

20:08.270 --> 20:10.920
You put my career first,
for once.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.230
Is that what this is about?

20:12.270 --> 20:13.750
Fuck you, Meg!

20:13.790 --> 20:16.190
Don't you dare patronize me.

20:19.970 --> 20:23.110
How do you know
they won't come after me again?

20:23.150 --> 20:25.370
- They won't.
- How do you know?

20:29.330 --> 20:31.330
You don't.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.396
Look, I should've told you.

20:32.420 --> 20:33.900
I'm-I'm sorry.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.600
Did you ever stop?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.300
Of course I did!

20:37.340 --> 20:38.380
How can you ask me that?

20:38.430 --> 20:40.520
Honey...

20:57.530 --> 21:00.750
You know, you could have
said thank you.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.710
Or did you just forget
that he had a gun to your head?

21:03.760 --> 21:05.450
Yeah, you're right.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.930
Thank you.

21:06.980 --> 21:09.070
I know you didn't have
to come with me.

21:14.110 --> 21:15.290
Yeah, I did.

21:27.650 --> 21:30.440
Hey. Look.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.350
Musa.
That was Al Moctar's

21:32.390 --> 21:35.310
code name for the shipments.

21:35.350 --> 21:37.880
"Pierre Falcon. Meet him.

21:37.920 --> 21:41.400
"Pier 2. 9:00 p.m.
Koulikoro."

21:41.450 --> 21:42.750
Koulikoro's a port on the Niger,

21:42.800 --> 21:44.540
just downstream from Bamako.

21:44.580 --> 21:46.800
That's probably
where the weapons came in.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.710
Yeah.
Pierre Falcon?

21:48.760 --> 21:51.240
Name of his contact.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.340
I'm not getting anything on him.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.120
So let's go down there
and take a look.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.340
Hey, I mean it.

22:08.430 --> 22:09.650
Thank you.

22:13.780 --> 22:16.570
For not leaving you alone
to die out here in the dirt?

22:16.610 --> 22:17.610
- Yeah.
- Say it.

22:17.660 --> 22:18.660
Really?

22:18.700 --> 22:21.010
Yeah.

22:21.050 --> 22:23.660
For not leaving me alone
to die out here.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.970
In the dirt.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.280
In the dirt.

22:37.070 --> 22:38.550
You're not forgiven.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.910
Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Weaver.

22:52.950 --> 22:55.040
Show him in.

23:00.220 --> 23:01.920
You hungry?

23:03.050 --> 23:04.920
Um, no, sir.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.100
Cornflakes at night.

23:07.140 --> 23:10.410
My mother used to give it to me
and my brother when I was a kid.

23:10.450 --> 23:12.450
I don't know why.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.370
Cheap, I guess.

23:14.410 --> 23:18.200
Never broke the habit.

23:19.810 --> 23:22.110
Senator Sullivan, sir...

23:22.160 --> 23:23.160
Family.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.850
You don't go near that.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.470
No.

23:27.510 --> 23:28.950
No, you do not.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.210
And you want my help.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.380
I do.

23:33.430 --> 23:35.390
She's a senator, sir.

23:35.430 --> 23:38.260
Amanda Jones.

23:38.300 --> 23:41.570
She didn't find
Clarke and Toumi yet?

23:41.610 --> 23:44.220
No.
Not yet.

23:44.260 --> 23:48.090
This tape is gonna cost us
an awful lot of money.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.490
We're stripping assets.

23:51.530 --> 23:54.230
We're taking a hit.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.360
Kingsley.

23:57.410 --> 23:58.980
I know the man.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.370
He won't sing.

24:01.410 --> 24:04.070
I can't say the same
for Amanda Jones.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.940
Can you?

24:07.640 --> 24:11.510
Well, I know that
she believes in this...

24:11.550 --> 24:14.160
If we need her
to take a fall for us...

24:14.210 --> 24:17.910
will you stake your life
upon her silence?

24:20.780 --> 24:23.520
You want me to help you.

24:23.570 --> 24:26.520
More than happy to do that.

24:26.570 --> 24:30.140
But I want you
to take care of Jones.

24:31.490 --> 24:32.790
We need her, sir.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.710
What we need
is someone at Langley.

24:36.750 --> 24:38.410
We had you.

24:38.450 --> 24:40.230
We had her.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.760
We'll find someone else.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.540
What's the name
of her second-in-command?

24:45.590 --> 24:47.720
Brandon Napier.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.160
Didn't you just send him
over there?

24:52.420 --> 24:54.770
You think I'm not informed, son?

24:54.810 --> 24:56.120
Why did you send him?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.640
Because she needed help.

24:58.690 --> 24:59.690
Really?

24:59.730 --> 25:01.780
That's it?

25:01.820 --> 25:03.950
Not because, somewhere
in the back of your mind,

25:04.000 --> 25:07.870
you knew you might need
someone else to take the reins?

25:13.180 --> 25:15.310
Excuse me.
I need to take this.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.490
- Go ahead.
- Dan?

25:17.530 --> 25:18.686
They got my delivery boy, Nate.

25:18.710 --> 25:20.190
Slow down.

25:20.230 --> 25:21.710
Who are we talking about?

25:21.750 --> 25:23.320
Clarke and Toumi.

25:23.360 --> 25:26.720
They took out Morten Nielsen
a few hours ago.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.590
He was my bridge to Al Moctar.

25:28.630 --> 25:30.280
Well, that's inconvenient.

25:30.330 --> 25:33.330
It's a little more
than inconvenient.

25:33.370 --> 25:36.730
His body was found
outside of Dianke.

25:36.770 --> 25:38.160
I thought you should know.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.420
I appreciate it, Dan.

25:39.470 --> 25:41.770
Yeah.

25:42.860 --> 25:45.390
I, uh...

25:45.430 --> 25:47.740
I need to go call Amanda Jones.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.650
Do it here, son.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.180
What?

25:52.220 --> 25:54.830
You do the call here, Nathan.

25:59.530 --> 26:01.360
Yes, sir.

26:09.450 --> 26:11.500
Hey.
Hey, it's me.

26:11.540 --> 26:12.820
I just got a call from Dan Lotz.

26:12.850 --> 26:14.720
Clarke and Toumi are in Dianke.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.110
Or they were,
as of two hours ago.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.550
Th...

26:17.590 --> 26:19.070
Hello?

26:19.120 --> 26:20.550
Hello?

26:20.600 --> 26:23.160
Yeah.

26:23.210 --> 26:26.380
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm-I'm here.

26:26.430 --> 26:28.910
They got to one of his, uh...
h-his guys.

26:28.950 --> 26:30.740
Morten Nielsen.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.650
Did they get anything from him?

26:32.690 --> 26:33.740
I don't know.

26:33.780 --> 26:35.310
Well, can you ask Lotz?

26:35.350 --> 26:37.390
You're the one
on the ground, Amanda.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.116
- Okay. I'll ask him.
- Whatever he gave them,

26:39.140 --> 26:40.660
that's where they'll go next.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.880
Nate.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.140
Kingsley?
The tape?

26:45.180 --> 26:47.100
I'm still working on it.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.190
Christ, Nate!

26:48.230 --> 26:49.450
Do not brush me off.

26:49.490 --> 26:51.280
I-I'm not doing anything else

26:51.320 --> 26:52.930
until you tell me what the fuck

26:52.980 --> 26:55.850
is going on over there.

27:00.980 --> 27:03.990
I-I went to Hal Weaver.

27:06.030 --> 27:07.730
You did what?

27:07.770 --> 27:09.170
He cut a deal with Kingsley,

27:09.210 --> 27:11.470
insurance, if the, uh...

27:11.520 --> 27:13.690
- if the tape comes out.
- Which is?

27:13.740 --> 27:17.560
That he'll stand down and...

27:17.610 --> 27:21.090
if there is an investigation...

27:21.130 --> 27:23.790
he'll take the fall for it.

27:23.830 --> 27:26.920
Maybe he does some time.
But, uh,

27:26.970 --> 27:28.660
he'll be looked after.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.550
They're offering
the same thing to you, Amanda.

27:31.970 --> 27:33.760
You'd be done at the Agency.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.460
Jesus.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.460
They'll find you a-a...

27:40.500 --> 27:44.500
a-a job on the... on the board
of one of these Fortune 500s.

27:44.550 --> 27:46.420
Seven figures.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.550
You and Evie won't worry about

27:48.600 --> 27:49.770
a thing.

27:53.340 --> 27:56.130
I'm sorry, Amanda.

28:00.350 --> 28:01.700
Yeah, well...

28:04.390 --> 28:06.350
I'm sure you did your best.

28:08.700 --> 28:11.310
The deal is contingent upon
you finding Clarke and Toumi.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.750
And if I don't?

28:18.100 --> 28:20.500
Then it gets complicated.

28:44.170 --> 28:47.790
Napier's in position, right?

28:47.830 --> 28:50.270
Mali's a dangerous place.

28:56.710 --> 28:59.360
I want the order
to come from you, Nate.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.200
Shit.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.190
Evening. Do you, uh...
do you speak English?

29:41.230 --> 29:43.060
Engine off.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.840
- Papers.
- Uh, we're working

29:44.890 --> 29:46.580
on the highway up at Bamba.

29:46.630 --> 29:48.240
We left our papers
in the trailer.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.760
- Where are you going?
- Uh, Bamako. Got to pick up

29:50.810 --> 29:52.980
some, uh, radios,
phones, batteries.

29:53.020 --> 29:55.540
What is your name? What... Tell
me your name. What is your name?

30:00.470 --> 30:03.510
Hey, um, for your trouble.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.860
Out.

30:04.910 --> 30:06.390
I didn't mean to offend you.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.950
Get out of the truck now!

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Okay, I'm getting out.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.260
I'm getting out.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.010
Americans are looking for you,
my friend.

30:24.750 --> 30:25.880
Hands where I can see them.

30:25.930 --> 30:27.670
- You too.
- Okay, easy.

30:27.710 --> 30:29.800
Easy.
I'm complying.

30:31.110 --> 30:32.850
- I'm complying.
- Tahirou.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.760
Tahirou, get out...

30:34.810 --> 30:37.420
Tahirou, get out here now!
Tahirou!

30:37.460 --> 30:39.290
Get out here now!

30:44.120 --> 30:45.356
- Put the gun down.
- Who are you?!

30:45.380 --> 30:46.470
Put it down!

30:46.510 --> 30:49.210
Listen to her.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.130
Where you from?

30:51.170 --> 30:52.560
What?

30:52.610 --> 30:54.260
Answer me.
Where are you from?

30:55.350 --> 30:56.870
Bamako.

30:56.910 --> 30:59.740
Sokoni.

30:59.790 --> 31:01.350
Missira.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.920
We're practically neighbors.

31:04.970 --> 31:08.010
I have a brother
and sister there.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.800
Just kids.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.890
You have any brothers?

31:12.930 --> 31:14.500
Sisters?

31:16.670 --> 31:18.540
Yes, he does.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.640
How many?

31:22.680 --> 31:24.720
How old?

31:24.770 --> 31:26.860
Just one.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.030
She's seven.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.300
Maybe they know each other.

31:32.650 --> 31:35.130
I want to see them again.

31:35.170 --> 31:38.090
Don't you want to see
your sister again?

31:46.490 --> 31:48.840
I don't want to die here.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.930
Do you?

31:55.190 --> 31:58.060
No one here wants
to die over this.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.410
Not today.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.640
Right. Down.
On the ground.

32:10.210 --> 32:11.990
The other one.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.220
Step aside.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.430
Wow.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.910
Get you.

33:06.390 --> 33:08.480
I don't even know how to shoot.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.060
Evening, Senator.

33:27.110 --> 33:29.680
You're a long way
from your neighborhood.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.940
Home doesn't have quite the same

33:31.980 --> 33:34.200
welcoming feel as it used to.

33:35.990 --> 33:38.120
Nothing to do with me, I hope.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.820
Who was she?

33:39.860 --> 33:42.510
The student
who made the complaint.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.300
I mean, uh...

33:44.340 --> 33:46.690
how do you find these people?

33:46.740 --> 33:48.650
Pretty low...

33:48.690 --> 33:51.480
- coming after my family.
- Says the woman

33:51.520 --> 33:55.140
- threatening to send my wife to jail.
- Difference is she's guilty.

33:55.180 --> 33:58.180
Well, I guess we're both
dedicated to our cause.

33:58.230 --> 34:00.010
And what is your cause,
Mr. Miller?

34:00.050 --> 34:01.660
Same as yours, Senator.

34:01.710 --> 34:03.750
- America.
- Except I serve

34:03.800 --> 34:06.540
the American people.

34:06.580 --> 34:10.409
Who do you serve...
beyond yourself?

34:10.460 --> 34:12.239
I put my life...

34:12.280 --> 34:14.679
on the line for this country.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.980
Can you say the same?

34:17.030 --> 34:19.070
"Serving the American people."

34:19.120 --> 34:22.340
That's the most overused phrase
in the history of the republic.

34:22.380 --> 34:24.300
What does that
even fucking mean, Senator?

34:24.340 --> 34:26.275
Seems like you've lost faith
in our democratic process.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.860
I've lost faith
in a lot of things.

34:27.909 --> 34:30.690
But you haven't lost faith
in William Kingsley.

34:30.739 --> 34:33.909
Do you think
he should run America?

34:33.960 --> 34:36.570
The government outsourced
the security of this country

34:36.610 --> 34:39.880
to make their boardroom friends
a few billion dollars.

34:42.179 --> 34:45.360
You're a mercenary, Mr. Miller.
Nothing more.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.840
Okay, let me tell you
something, Senator.

34:48.889 --> 34:52.020
I've seen bureaucrats
here in D.C. protect their turf

34:52.060 --> 34:55.590
at the expense of men and women
on the battlefield.

34:55.630 --> 34:58.330
I've seen towers come down

34:58.370 --> 35:01.290
because of inflated egos
and agency rivalries.

35:01.330 --> 35:05.160
I've seen friends die...
Good people...

35:05.210 --> 35:07.316
Because of the slow-footed
incompetence of politicians

35:07.340 --> 35:09.380
who are only interested
in hanging on

35:09.430 --> 35:11.260
to their fucking careers.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.480
So, yes, I'll work
for whoever gets the job done.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.560
There are other ways
of doing it.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.416
Who's to say that your way
is better than mine?

35:17.440 --> 35:18.870
Who paid your ransom?

35:18.920 --> 35:21.440
I want names, details.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.490
How the whole thing works.

35:23.530 --> 35:25.790
Everything you have
on the deep state.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.360
There is no deep state, Senator.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.100
Just a bunch of old white guys
clinging to power,

35:30.140 --> 35:32.540
doing everything they can
to protect their interests

35:32.580 --> 35:34.240
before they become extinct.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.720
They will be held to account,
Mr. Miller,

35:36.760 --> 35:38.800
by our Congress, by our press,

35:38.850 --> 35:40.890
if not by our
spineless government,

35:40.940 --> 35:43.420
and you are going
to help me do that.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.200
Knowing me like you do,
you really think

35:45.250 --> 35:48.290
- that that's gonna happen?
- If you don't want little Katie

35:48.340 --> 35:52.380
spending her 12th birthday
visiting her mom in prison...

35:52.430 --> 35:56.040
yeah, actually, I do.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.830
I'm gonna go to bed.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.180
You sleep well, Senator.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.470
Nate?

36:38.040 --> 36:39.910
Amanda Jones.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.520
Consider it done.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.790
And I will put your wife
beyond reach.

37:11.420 --> 37:13.380
Mm.

37:17.510 --> 37:19.600
- Yeah?
- Adam.

37:19.640 --> 37:20.730
Amanda Jones.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.080
An unexpected pleasure.

37:22.130 --> 37:25.000
I can't hear you.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.040
Hold on, I'm just moving.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.830
Are you sober?

37:30.870 --> 37:32.400
Well...

37:32.440 --> 37:34.010
depends what for.

37:34.050 --> 37:36.920
Do you want another crack
at Clarke and Toumi?

37:39.060 --> 37:41.280
You're a fucking
beautiful woman,

37:41.320 --> 37:43.670
did I ever tell you that?

37:48.720 --> 37:50.850
They should be in room six.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.750
Are they here?

38:18.790 --> 38:20.180
Yes, of course.

38:20.230 --> 38:22.970
Come.
Come, come, come.

38:33.630 --> 38:36.810
Oh, I missed you.

38:36.850 --> 38:39.200
I missed you.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.160
I missed you.

38:44.730 --> 38:48.390
Thank you,
for bringing them here.

38:48.430 --> 38:51.690
You're welcome.

38:51.740 --> 38:54.130
And where did you find the body?
One of my men found him

38:54.170 --> 38:56.220
- in an old mining hut in Dianke.
- Fuck.

38:56.260 --> 38:57.740
What did this guy do for you?

38:57.790 --> 38:59.660
He was my main contact
for shipment.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.750
And what did Morten know,
exactly?

39:01.790 --> 39:03.570
Well, he knew everything.

39:03.620 --> 39:05.490
Okay. Thank you.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.670
If Morten spilled,

39:09.710 --> 39:12.280
Clarke and Toumi
will be on to Pierre Falcon.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.600
They'll be heading for the port.

39:13.630 --> 39:15.370
So we get a jump on them.

39:15.410 --> 39:16.460
I want to use McKay.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.330
Keep it low-profile.

39:18.370 --> 39:20.420
Stay here.

39:20.460 --> 39:22.680
Until we call you.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.470
I'll do that.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.690
Thank you.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.520
Both of you.

39:37.570 --> 39:40.440
- We're not out of it yet.
- Oh...

39:40.480 --> 39:43.830
can't you accept
just a little bit of gratitude?

39:43.880 --> 39:44.920
He can't, no.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.750
It's one of his many gifts.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.070
I'm not supposed
to be talking to you.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.120
Sir, I...

40:08.160 --> 40:09.860
Don't call me that.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.030
You don't work for me anymore.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.080
Hell...

40:14.120 --> 40:16.080
you don't even work for them.

40:16.130 --> 40:17.740
Did Miller tell you that?

40:17.780 --> 40:21.090
Miller didn't tell me
a goddamn thing.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.220
Miller didn't talk to you?

40:25.570 --> 40:27.570
He told you
he was coming to see me,

40:27.620 --> 40:28.830
didn't he?

40:28.880 --> 40:30.920
He went straight to Hal,

40:30.970 --> 40:32.840
right over my head.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.360
I almost admire the bastard.

40:39.580 --> 40:43.200
They will fuck you, Amanda.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.280
Don't you be

40:45.330 --> 40:48.810
under any illusion
about that one.

41:06.310 --> 41:09.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:10.610 --> 41:12.010
You want to come in?

41:12.050 --> 41:13.790
No.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.270
No, I've got to...

41:15.310 --> 41:16.660
I got to get some sleep.

41:16.710 --> 41:18.230
Okay.

41:18.270 --> 41:19.670
I just want you to know

41:19.710 --> 41:21.670
that you don't have
to worry about Sullivan.

41:25.590 --> 41:28.460
You could've called.

41:29.590 --> 41:31.070
Yeah.

41:31.110 --> 41:34.460
I could have.

41:35.860 --> 41:39.210
She's okay, right?

41:39.250 --> 41:41.210
Sullivan?

41:41.250 --> 41:43.690
She's fine.

41:43.730 --> 41:46.740
What did you think
I would do to her, Nic?

41:53.140 --> 41:55.180
Sorry, it's-it's been
a long day.

41:55.220 --> 41:56.920
I...

41:59.450 --> 42:01.540
Thank you.

42:03.190 --> 42:06.100
I've got your back.

42:06.150 --> 42:08.060
Always.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.210
And that's why he's
known as the king

42:20.250 --> 42:22.430
of the outfield. Bottom
of the fourth, one ball...

42:22.470 --> 42:24.626
- he's having problems with his
pitching elbow... There we go, Aaron.

42:24.650 --> 42:27.650
- Thanks. See you tomorrow.
- Here's the windup. Foul ball.

43:23.790 --> 43:25.360
What's going on?

43:25.400 --> 43:27.880
I'm going to stay
at my sister's.

43:30.710 --> 43:33.100
We can talk about this.

43:33.150 --> 43:36.500
You know, I don't even mind
that everything about you

43:36.540 --> 43:39.280
comes before
everything about me.

43:39.330 --> 43:42.680
I got used to that. I got used
to that a long time ago.

43:42.720 --> 43:45.120
I got used to your crusades

43:45.160 --> 43:47.600
and the price
that I have to pay for them.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.900
But then you lie to me?

43:52.210 --> 43:54.300
And then I start thinking

43:54.340 --> 43:57.170
that maybe you've lied
about other things.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.570
Oh, God, I'm sor...

44:02.610 --> 44:04.010
No.

44:04.050 --> 44:05.700
Don't.

44:27.860 --> 44:29.600
How's Tessa?

44:31.340 --> 44:33.120
Small talk?

44:33.160 --> 44:34.950
Not really your style.

44:39.430 --> 44:40.740
Anything?

44:42.260 --> 44:44.130
No. Nothing.

44:53.490 --> 44:54.840
Right, there's pier two.

44:56.230 --> 44:59.360
Maybe Pierre Falcon
has an office in there.

45:48.150 --> 45:50.590
Pierre Falcon. It's a ship,

45:50.630 --> 45:52.370
not a person.

45:54.160 --> 45:56.200
And that's how
they bring the arms in.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.690
Well, there's no way we're
getting on that thing.

46:32.460 --> 46:33.810
They're here.

46:48.870 --> 46:51.300
Leyla, it's here.
Pierre Falcon.

46:54.390 --> 46:56.960
Leased by a company called
Ecomaritime.

47:00.660 --> 47:02.880
Oh, shit.

48:15.780 --> 48:17.080
Go.

48:25.530 --> 48:27.830
Fucking Christ.

48:41.020 --> 48:42.150
This way.

49:08.310 --> 49:09.660
Brandon.

49:48.180 --> 49:49.960
Colonel Russell,

49:50.000 --> 49:51.790
it's Amanda Jones.
Clarke and Toumi

49:51.830 --> 49:55.050
are on their way to a company
called Ecomaritime.

49:55.100 --> 49:57.100
I'm sending you the address now.

49:57.140 --> 49:58.620
I'll send a team.

49:58.660 --> 50:00.540
I'll meet you there.

50:10.110 --> 50:11.940
This is it.

50:53.810 --> 50:55.160
Clean energy.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.110
- Solar panels, wind farms...
- Desalination plants,

50:58.160 --> 51:01.070
water purification kits.

51:01.120 --> 51:04.080
It's a perfect cover
if you want to ship arms.

51:08.820 --> 51:11.560
There has to be a link
to KMPH in here.

51:16.920 --> 51:19.530
Wheels up in five minutes.

51:19.570 --> 51:22.140
Take me off the manifest.

51:24.450 --> 51:28.100
No one...
knows I am on this flight.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.960
Harry.

52:05.230 --> 52:07.660
I've seen this man.

52:07.710 --> 52:09.400
Moussa Diarra. CEO.

52:09.450 --> 52:11.060
No, the man with him.

52:11.100 --> 52:12.596
Two years ago,
after we came back from Mali,

52:12.620 --> 52:15.630
George White and I went
to see Yambo Kanté,

52:15.670 --> 52:18.330
the puppet they installed
as president... he was there.

52:18.370 --> 52:19.540
Who is he?

52:19.590 --> 52:21.680
No idea.

52:35.340 --> 52:38.170
Shit.
Let's go.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.640
Don't you fucking move!
