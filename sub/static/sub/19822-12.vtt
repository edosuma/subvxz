<i>Nika, Sal, thank goodness.
Are you okay?</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:11.477
We're fine, but getting
kidnapped was pretty scary.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.013
(Anika) We only got away 'cause
I told Stella and Arthur

00:14.081 --> 00:16.347
I had to go to the bathroom
and I took so long

00:16.417 --> 00:17.750
that Daniel came to rescue us.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.685
Oh, it was nothing.

00:19.754 --> 00:22.154
I just did what anybody would
have done in the situation.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.156
Why would Saganash send those people

00:24.225 --> 00:25.624
to kidnap Nika and Sal?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.826
<i>He really wants that diamond.</i>

00:27.895 --> 00:29.495
<i>And he'll do anything to get it.</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:31.897
Yeah, but fake foster
parents, that's low.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.099
<i>That's why we want you out of there</i>

00:34.168 --> 00:37.336

as soon as possible.</i>

00:37.405 --> 00:39.038

up temporarily.</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:40.272
Uh-uh. We're not doing that.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.908
We tried that once and
that really wasn't safe.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.543
We're the safest when
we're all together.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.111

00:59.627 --> 01:00.859
We've got help.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.094

01:02.163 --> 01:03.662

01:06.567 --> 01:08.767

a red diamond too.

01:15.042 --> 01:18.610
<i>So it's true. There is a red diamond.</i>

01:18.679 --> 01:21.947
<i>According to family legend,
back in the 1600s,</i>

01:22.016 --> 01:26.385
<i>young Saganash gave the red
diamond to Josephine Hunter.</i>

01:26.454 --> 01:28.153

trading ship after her.</i>

11:26.319 --> 11:27.852
I don't know what you're up to,

11:27.921 --> 11:30.088
but we promised your parents
we'd look after you.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.990
Yeah, no, but right
now, you have to go.

11:32.059 --> 11:32.991
No, she doesn't.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.393
Yes, she does. And you too, Tim.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.195
Of course <i> he</i> does.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.431
What's going on?

11:39.499 --> 11:41.366
I can't say. It's too embarrassing.

11:41.435 --> 11:42.701
It's okay, Max.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.669
Whatever it is, just tell us.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.605
Um...

11:47.674 --> 11:49.941
we have lice.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.244
I don't know how it happened.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.246
Uh, somebody at school
must have had it.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.015
Yeah, I think it was a goodbye present

11:57.084 --> 11:58.583
from Aunt Hedwig and Uncle Eugene.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.617
Watch out!

11:59.686 --> 12:01.086
They could jump from off the head.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.621
We've got this special shampoo

12:03.690 --> 12:05.156
that I think we should
all go use right now.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.460
I once heard a story about a
boy and he had lice so bad,

12:08.528 --> 12:11.129
he had to shave his whole
head and it never grew back.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.398
Don't tell me that!

12:13.467 --> 12:14.799
Ow! What?! You pinched me!

12:14.868 --> 12:16.000
Sorry, I saw it jump.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.070
So, should we do the treatment now

12:19.139 --> 12:20.238
or after lunch?

12:20.307 --> 12:21.473
Now! Now! Now!

12:21.541 --> 12:24.275
It's probably a good idea
to get it taken care of

12:24.344 --> 12:26.578
as soon as possible.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.981
Do you want to grab a bite to eat?

12:30.050 --> 12:33.118
I know a really nice place
in the city center.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.119
If you like sushi.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.221
Oh, my gosh, I love sushi.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.624
Well... good luck, guys.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.693
We'll check back with you later.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.862
Yeah, uh, in two hours, maybe?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.632
Come on.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.267
I'm not letting any lice make me bald.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.268
Where's the shampoo?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.137
There is no shampoo.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.138
What?!

12:53.206 --> 12:54.405
How are we supposed to get rid of...

12:54.474 --> 12:56.775
There's no lice either, man.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.076
That's just great.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.511
Wait, wait, what's this all about?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.012
Why did you chase Simone
out of the house?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.413
Sorry, bro, we had to.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.948
Why?!

13:04.017 --> 13:05.550
We think we might have
found the red diamond.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.956
♪♪

13:20.600 --> 13:23.535
Welcome to the National
Maritime Museum.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.805
Wow, you guys are really
part of the Hunter family.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.206
it is an honor to meet you.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.774
It's an honor to be here.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.609
So, let's go in.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.411
I for one can't wait to explore

13:33.480 --> 13:35.013
how the sea has shaped
our country's culture.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.515
Not so fast. We're closed today.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.651
Couldn't you let us in
for just a few minutes?

13:39.719 --> 13:40.752
Please!

13:40.821 --> 13:42.554
What kind of security guard would I be

13:42.622 --> 13:45.356
if I let anybody walk in to
the museum when it's closed?

13:45.425 --> 13:46.558
But we're not just anybody.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.660
Our Hunter ancestors

13:48.728 --> 13:50.528
were part of the Dutch
East India company.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.064
They explored the world and
helped create the history

13:53.133 --> 13:55.600
that this museum commemorates.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.970
Well, when you put it like that...

13:59.039 --> 14:01.506
go. Explore away.

14:01.575 --> 14:02.907
Start in the hall of the founders

14:02.976 --> 14:04.776
of the East India trading company.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.411
It's a great way to begin the tour.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.812
Now get out of here.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.247
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.448
Have fun, you guys.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.150
And don't tell anybody I let
you guys in, all right?

14:12.219 --> 14:13.151
We won't. Thank you.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.152
All right.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.257
There it is.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.935
This is it, the hall of the founders

14:31.004 --> 14:32.437
of the Dutch East India company.

14:37.577 --> 14:41.312
Guys, this museum's huge. I
know the diamond's pretty big,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.181
but it's still like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

14:45.919 --> 14:46.951
Hey, buddy.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.787
You didn't happen to
see like a red diamond

14:49.856 --> 14:51.723
someplace around here, did you?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.157
No?

14:53.226 --> 14:54.859
Good talk.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.597
Guys, this thing moves.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.133
Remember the letter?

15:02.202 --> 15:05.770
"...my lord's eyes be idle."

15:05.839 --> 15:08.106
Jan Saganash was talking
about his bosses.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.173
So?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.708
Is this gonna be one of
your history lessons?

15:10.777 --> 15:14.078
<i>These</i> are the founders of the
Dutch East India company.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.481
I'll take that as a yes.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.950
I'm lost. What's your point, Sal?

15:19.019 --> 15:21.252
You'll see. Everybody rotate them.

15:24.791 --> 15:25.723
(straining) It's heavy.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.126
Daniel.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.302
(clanking)

15:57.057 --> 15:58.523
Guys! Max!

15:58.591 --> 16:00.825
Max, are you okay?!

16:00.894 --> 16:01.826
Say something!

16:01.895 --> 16:04.095
Yeah, I can hear you. I'm okay.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.232
I'm gonna check this place out.

16:20.947 --> 16:24.082
(water dripping)

17:05.724 --> 17:08.358
More 1600s chicken scratch. Seriously?

17:08.428 --> 17:13.097
"Josephine, you ne'er came to meet me.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.299
"Why, I cannot fathom.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.568
"I intend to give to
you the fiery jewel

17:17.637 --> 17:19.871
"as a token of my blazing passion.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.607
But I shall hold to it fast instead."

17:22.675 --> 17:23.775
(loud bang)

17:31.051 --> 17:34.452
"Here be the chain in which the
jewel would have been cradled,

17:34.521 --> 17:38.256
"as I cradle my heart within my own.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.825
With a broken heart, Jan Saganash."

17:47.600 --> 17:49.534
Don't come any closer!

17:49.602 --> 17:51.903
These arms... registered weapons.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.922
Hello?

18:10.990 --> 18:13.257
(man) <i>So, Maximilian, at last,</i>

18:13.326 --> 18:15.426
<i>we have a chance to talk.</i>

18:15.495 --> 18:17.128
Who is this?

18:17.197 --> 18:19.597
<i>I think you know exactly who this is.</i>

18:19.666 --> 18:23.301
<i>We have a lot in common, Maximilian.</i>

18:23.369 --> 18:24.869
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

18:24.938 --> 18:27.071
<i>You prefer Max, if I'm not mistaken.</i>

18:27.140 --> 18:29.307
I don't have anything in
common with you, Saganash.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.275
<i>Ah, but you do.</i>

18:31.344 --> 18:34.112
<i>We both want the red
diamond, for example.</i>

18:34.180 --> 18:35.813
<i>It's mine, you know?</i>

18:35.882 --> 18:37.148
<i>But you're getting there much faster</i>

18:37.217 --> 18:39.050
<i>than I imagined you would.</i>

18:39.119 --> 18:40.485
I didn't find it.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.921
<i>(laughs) No, I'm quite sure you didn't.</i>

18:43.990 --> 18:45.690
<i>Listen, I think we can help each other.</i>

18:45.758 --> 18:46.991
We don't need your help.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.327
<i>We? Oh, you mean the Hunters?</i>

18:49.395 --> 18:51.629
<i>You think you're one of them.</i>

18:51.698 --> 18:55.066
<i>Why, because they gave
you a bed and a roof.</i>

18:55.135 --> 18:57.468
<i>These are the Hunters
we're talking about.</i>

18:57.537 --> 19:01.639
<i>No matter what they say,
they'll never accept you.</i>

19:01.708 --> 19:03.074
You don't know what
you're talking about.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.076
<i>I know where you belong, Max.</i>

19:05.145 --> 19:07.445
<i>And if you're as smart
as I think you are,</i>

19:07.514 --> 19:10.414
<i>you'll accept my invitation.</i>

19:10.483 --> 19:13.818
<i>And I'll show you your birth parents.</i>

19:13.887 --> 19:15.253
<i>But only you.</i>

19:25.965 --> 19:27.999
Who are you?

19:41.915 --> 19:43.981
Guys, can you open the door?

19:44.050 --> 19:45.349
We can't get the door open?

19:45.418 --> 19:48.486
Did you try turning the statues?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.421
Let's try.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.089
(Daniel) All right...

19:52.158 --> 19:54.025
(all) Three... two... one.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.731
Yes!

20:02.035 --> 20:03.668
Dude, you okay?

20:03.736 --> 20:06.404
While I was in there,
I found something.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.773
Let's get out of his first
right now, all right?

20:14.314 --> 20:17.815
"And you shall feel as barren
and unloved as I do now.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.850
With broken heart, Jan Saganash."

20:19.919 --> 20:23.354
So... he took the diamond with him?

20:23.423 --> 20:26.123
On his trip to the colonies?

20:26.192 --> 20:28.726
That's Indonesia?

20:28.795 --> 20:30.194
And he never came back?

20:30.263 --> 20:32.230
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

20:32.298 --> 20:36.133
<i>So the red diamond might be
at the bottom of the sea.</i>

20:36.202 --> 20:38.736
Oh, well, that shouldn't
be too hard to find.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.771
How much ocean is there in the world?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.773
A million miles?

20:42.842 --> 20:45.376
(Sal) 140 million square miles.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.945
Give or take.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.748
So we need to find out
where the ship went down.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.784
Over 350 years ago.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.554
<i>Hey, don't look like that.</i>

20:56.623 --> 20:58.589
<i>This is progress.</i>

20:58.658 --> 21:01.158
<i>Thanks to Max, we're one
step ahead of Saganash.</i>

21:01.227 --> 21:02.593
<i>Good going, Max.</i>

21:02.662 --> 21:04.629
<i>But it was real risky</i>

21:04.697 --> 21:06.464
<i>for you to be there all by yourself</i>

21:06.532 --> 21:07.632
<i>when the museum was closed.</i>

21:07.700 --> 21:09.166
<i>What if Saganash had shown up?</i>

21:09.235 --> 21:12.036
<i>Well, nothing happened
and everyone is okay.</i>

21:12.105 --> 21:13.337
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

21:13.406 --> 21:14.338
I'm not okay.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.640
<i>What's wrong, honey?</i>

21:15.708 --> 21:17.642
I really miss you.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.443
<i>Oh.</i>

21:19.512 --> 21:22.146
<i>Well... we miss you too.</i>

21:25.018 --> 21:28.352
<i>Hey, I know something that
will make you feel less sad.</i>

21:28.421 --> 21:30.421
<i>You just have to close your eyes</i>

21:30.490 --> 21:34.325
<i>and think of the last good
moment we were all together.</i>

21:34.394 --> 21:36.160
That's what Max said.

21:36.229 --> 21:39.030
<i>Well, like father, like son.</i>

21:39.098 --> 21:41.499
<i>Okay, close your eyes.</i>

21:49.642 --> 21:51.976
(Saganash) And if you
respond as I think you are,

21:52.045 --> 21:54.245
you'll accept my invitation

21:54.314 --> 21:57.515
and I'll show you your birth parents.

21:57.583 --> 21:58.916
But only you.
