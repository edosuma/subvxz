- <i>Previously, on</i> Good Witch:
- Movies at the old Middleton Theatre

00:03.170 --> 00:05.337
- again? That's a great idea!
- And they want me to

00:05.372 --> 00:06.300
invest in it with them.

00:06.325 --> 00:09.508
If I listen to people more,
I might get more of what I want.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.845
I wanted you to know
how much I care about you.

00:18.152 --> 00:21.853
You were so certain you were right!

00:23.724 --> 00:25.791
I had tried the combination
a dozen times!

00:25.826 --> 00:28.060
Hmm. Well, it's a good thing
you tried a thirteenth.

00:28.095 --> 00:31.697
Well, which allowed you to be
right. But I'm glad you were.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.965
No, I wasn't trying to be
right, I was trying to be nice.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.535
See, I didn't want you standing
outside your door in the cold

00:36.570 --> 00:38.637
on your first night here.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.673
I never even imagined
meeting a neighbor like you.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.177
I can't imagine living
next door to anyone else.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.407
Almost makes a guy believe in fate.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.683
- I said, "almost."
- See, that's what I love

00:51.719 --> 00:53.919
about you. You never take
anything at face value.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.188
You wait 'til you're absolutely
certain something is true

00:56.223 --> 00:59.391
before you say it, which is why it
means so much more when you do.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.259
Hm. Well,

01:01.295 --> 01:03.338
here's something that's true.

01:05.048 --> 01:07.566
You changed everything for me.

01:08.552 --> 01:12.504
And I hardly remember how we got
here. But I am glad we did.

01:13.265 --> 01:16.074
I can't wait to see where we go next.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.284
And I want to say one more thing.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.946
Yeah?

01:29.490 --> 01:32.090
How could you possibly have known

01:32.126 --> 01:34.092
that that key box
would open the last time?

01:34.128 --> 01:36.895
- Let it go, Sam.
- It's going to bug me forever.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.898
Well, maybe that's why I did it.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.798
Now, before we finish our meeting,

02:12.833 --> 02:15.267
let me just say what
a pleasure it was to have

02:15.302 --> 02:18.236
Cassie Nightingale here with us
this morning. It's always

02:18.272 --> 02:21.173
nice to see a former mayor
supporting the current one.

02:21.208 --> 02:24.334
It's comforting to know that
Middleton is in such good hands.

02:24.370 --> 02:27.913
Well, you picked a good day to be
here, because you get to see me honor

02:27.948 --> 02:30.849
Ben Patterson for all the
valuable work he's done.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.420
Ben?

02:37.691 --> 02:40.792
Now, as many of you know,
Ben has been renovating

02:40.828 --> 02:44.262
the old Middleton Theatre, and
he tells me it's just about

02:44.298 --> 02:46.198
ready for its grand re-opening
this Friday night.

02:46.233 --> 02:49.000
Tickets are on sale at the
Bistro and at the box office.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.303
It's a wonderful addition
to our community

02:51.338 --> 02:55.307
and the council would like to
give you a special thanks.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.243
Oh yeah, sorry.

02:58.278 --> 03:01.313
So Ben, I hereby present
you with this special

03:01.348 --> 03:03.148
commendation for enhancing

03:03.183 --> 03:06.117
the beauty of our already
beautiful surroundings.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.520
Thank you, Madam Mayor.
This... this is really...

03:08.555 --> 03:10.889
Un-huh. Jared, a picture, please.

03:14.695 --> 03:18.163
Oh, I am so proud of him!
He's worked so hard on that theatre.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.332
And I'm sure there are a lot
of people who are going to

03:20.367 --> 03:22.667
- appreciate his work.
- Yeah.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.472
Oh! You'll wanna hang that
photo in the lobby, I'm sure.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.841
- Maybe so.
- Well, I believe

03:29.877 --> 03:32.711
that that's just about it for today.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.846
Jared, is there any unfinished business?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.883
There was Councilwoman
Barkley's bid to have new trees

03:37.918 --> 03:40.051
- planted in front of city hall.
- Oh, yes.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.220
We've wanted to get
those for a long time.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.891
And the Westside Homeowner's petition
for a new swing set at the park.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.726
Can I approve them without discussion?

03:48.253 --> 03:50.729
- If there are no objections.
- And who

03:50.764 --> 03:53.164
is going to object to the mayor?

03:53.200 --> 03:56.902
Very well, then. I hereby
approve both proposals.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.104
And, since there are no further motions,

03:59.139 --> 04:02.274
this meeting is adjourned.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.843
Wow. I've never been
at one of these meetings

04:04.878 --> 04:06.611
before. Is this always how they go?

04:06.647 --> 04:08.042
They used to be a lot quieter

04:08.067 --> 04:09.848
- til she started using the gavel.
- Ah.

04:09.883 --> 04:14.386
Oh, oh, oh. One more order
of business. We need to buy

04:14.421 --> 04:16.387
a bigger gavel. No objections?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.341
So moved!

04:19.293 --> 04:21.392
- Jared, come.
- Yup.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.269
- Good morning.
- Did you know there was

04:31.305 --> 04:34.072
something called "Medical
Assistant's Appreciation Week"?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.441
- No.
- Neither did I, which is why

04:36.476 --> 04:38.410
I missed it, which is why I'm here.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.880
I need to get Eve some... chocolates!

04:41.915 --> 04:44.683
Well, I'm sure she'll appreciate that.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.894
That's the idea.

04:46.919 --> 04:49.321
We just got some new orchids in as well,

04:49.356 --> 04:51.222
if you're looking for
something for Cassie too.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.725
- I'm just here for the candy.
- Are you sure?

04:53.760 --> 04:56.795
Orchids are the perfect way
to say, "I love you."

04:57.489 --> 04:59.397
Cassie knows how I feel about her.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.232
Mmm, flowers say it louder.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.069
I can speak for myself. Thank you.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.338
OK.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.440
And put a couple of extra
pieces in there for me,

05:08.475 --> 05:10.508
Please. I didn't have
time to make a lunch.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.178
You're going to have candy for lunch?

05:13.213 --> 05:15.981
My doctor says it's OK.

05:17.134 --> 05:19.497
Wait, you think you have the bulbs here?

05:19.533 --> 05:21.419
There's an interesting mix

05:21.455 --> 05:23.598
of odd things up here.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.691
There's a box of old bulbs

05:26.727 --> 05:29.127
somewhere that I never
wanted to throw away.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.864
Maybe one of them will fit
the projector at your theatre.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.333
It'd be a miracle
if it did. It's kind of

05:35.369 --> 05:37.335
a special one that no one makes anymore.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.471
I'm never surprised
at the kinds of things

05:39.506 --> 05:41.439
I discover in this old house.

05:43.452 --> 05:45.844
I sometimes feel sorry
for all the stuff up here,

05:45.879 --> 05:48.847
just set aside and forgotten about.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.116
You feel sorry for things in the attic?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.652
I know it's weird, but I dunno...

05:53.687 --> 05:57.122
I want things to be
seen and appreciated.

06:02.182 --> 06:04.015
There.

06:04.231 --> 06:07.632
This has been in here
ever since I moved in.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.801
But I don't know what
any of these are for.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.471
The one for the projector
is kind of long,

06:13.507 --> 06:17.142
and it's got these pins on the
end and the product number is

06:17.177 --> 06:20.178
- D, L, N...
- ...Seven, five, zero, W?

06:22.015 --> 06:25.150
Yes. Yes, this is perfect.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.386
- There's a couple more in there.
- You can take the whole box.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.789
Thank you.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.836
Oh!

06:35.862 --> 06:39.064
- What are these?
- Film canisters.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.533
Yeah, that's what movies used to
come on before they started

06:41.568 --> 06:43.512
showing up on our phones.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.172
It doesn't say what
the name of the movie is.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.674
I could show it at
the theatre to find out.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.644
Nick, why don't you take all
that back to the theatre with Ben?

06:52.679 --> 06:55.513
I'm sure he could use a hand
getting the projector set up.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.416
- Sure.
- Great.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.956
- I'll see ya.
- Yeah.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.795
So. Are we ever going
to clean this attic out?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.131
- I don't know.
- I kinda like the mystery

07:13.166 --> 07:16.701
of re-discovering forgotten
things every time we come up.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.871
Like finding old buried treasure.

07:19.906 --> 07:23.051
A little bit, yeah.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.550
Thank you for approving my
proposal this morning, Madam Mayor.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.652
It was my pleasure. One of
the great joys of being

07:34.688 --> 07:37.222
the mayor is being able to make
this city a better place.

07:37.257 --> 07:40.325
- Mayor Tinsdale.
- Excuse me, won't you?

07:40.360 --> 07:41.653
Oh! Of course.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.829
I need to talk with you about the
things you approved this morning.

07:44.865 --> 07:48.166
OK. Why are we whispering?

07:48.201 --> 07:52.103
Because you're gonna
have to un-approve them.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.907
I will not! As mayor,
my word is my bond.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.176
If I say that we're getting
trees and swing sets,

07:58.211 --> 08:00.245
we're getting trees and swing sets!

08:00.280 --> 08:02.747
Except we have no money to get anything!

08:02.783 --> 08:05.416
- Of course we do.
- No, we don't!

08:06.177 --> 08:08.419
You've been saying "yes"
to so many things

08:08.455 --> 08:11.489
that the extra expenditure
account is nearly empty.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.854
How much money do we have left?

08:16.630 --> 08:20.932
I shouldn't have said "nearly."
There's nothing in it at all.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.601
You mean we can't buy <i> anything?</i>

08:24.446 --> 08:27.672
- Not even a new gavel.
- Well,

08:27.707 --> 08:30.175
there's no need to add insult to injury.

08:40.044 --> 08:42.654
OK, this goes down through here,

08:42.688 --> 08:44.328
then back onto the take-up reel,

08:44.363 --> 08:47.636
and if we did this right...

08:50.197 --> 08:53.498
Ha ha! Look at that! It works!

08:55.936 --> 08:58.069
Hey, you wanna watch it? I mean,

08:58.104 --> 09:00.705
it's six or seven reels long.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.874
What's the movie even about?

09:02.909 --> 09:05.677
I don't know. Let's find out.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.246
- Hello?
- Hey.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.882
- Oh, Nick.
- Hey, Grace.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.751
- I didn't think you'd still be here.
- Yeah, Ben showed me

09:13.787 --> 09:16.152
all the work he did fixing up the place.

09:16.177 --> 09:18.189
- He did a great job.
- Oh, thanks.

09:18.225 --> 09:22.360
Well, hey, Mom sent me over
here after she found this.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.530
She thinks it's the final
reel of the movie.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.333
- We were just about to run it.
- Oh, can I watch?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.702
Pick any seat in the theatre.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.912
Please silence your cell
phones, and no talking.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.515
I know the rules, just start the show!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.974
- Hey. How was the movie?
- Hey.

10:21.999 --> 10:24.188
Oh. How did you know I saw the movie?

10:24.224 --> 10:27.425
Well, I figured you'd get curious while
you were there and want to see it.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.661
Ah, is that why you
had me go over there?

10:29.696 --> 10:31.996
I just sent my daughter
on an errand, that's all.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.733
Oh, well, I'm glad that you
did, because it was great.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.237
I mean, OK, I've heard people say,
"They don't make them like that anymore"

10:39.272 --> 10:42.073
- and now I know what they mean.
- Who was in it?

10:42.108 --> 10:44.642
- Uh, I don't know.
- Nobody I had ever seen before.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.844
It was one of those black and
white movies from the thirties,

10:46.880 --> 10:49.747
and it was so funny and romantic

10:49.783 --> 10:52.583
and I can't wait for you to see it.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.786
Ben decided to show it at
the theatre for the opening.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.721
Hmm. I think that's a very good choice.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.090
In the movie there was
a woman named Jenny.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.259
She just thinks that
the town needs something

11:01.294 --> 11:03.761
- and then makes it happen.
- A woman of action.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.697
Yeah, she had this sense...

11:05.732 --> 11:07.932
well, she called it her
"flutter"... where she knew

11:07.968 --> 11:09.934
when things were going
to turn out right or wrong.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.937
Huh. I think I'm going
to like this movie.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.640
I think you're going to love it.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.709
Is it all right if I see
the mayor tomorrow?

11:17.744 --> 11:20.945
There's something that
I want to talk to her about.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.781
Is my daughter planning
on changing the world?

11:23.817 --> 11:25.450
Just a small part of it.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.785
Well, I hope everything turns
out the way you want it to.

11:28.254 --> 11:32.657
I have a feeling it might.
For all of us.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.596
Well, I guess we should
go with candy bars then.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.465
What's standard?

11:49.901 --> 11:52.468
OK, sounds good. Thanks.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.394
Who were you talking to?

12:01.429 --> 12:03.529
I'm doing concessions for
opening night at the theatre

12:03.564 --> 12:05.598
so just ordering snacks.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.534
- Plain old snacks?
- Movie stuff, yeah.

12:08.569 --> 12:12.872
- It's supposed to be a special night.
- It is. For Ben.

12:12.907 --> 12:16.575
And don't you want him
to know how much you love him?

12:16.611 --> 12:19.312
I always want him to know that.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.782
Well, if it were me...

12:22.617 --> 12:25.539
- You know what, never mind.
- What?

12:25.574 --> 12:28.821
I just think anything
"plain" is gonna seem like

12:28.856 --> 12:31.057
you hardly even tried.

12:31.526 --> 12:33.326
You know, you're kind of right.

12:33.361 --> 12:36.228
I just remember my high
school graduation party,

12:36.264 --> 12:39.799
all my mother put out was
tortilla chips. No salsa.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.801
And it still bothers you, doesn't it?

12:41.836 --> 12:45.137
- She barely made any effort at all.
- Well, you don't want Ben

12:45.173 --> 12:47.640
to remember that night the same
way you remember this one.

12:47.675 --> 12:50.309
Who puts out chips without any salsa?

12:50.345 --> 12:52.222
So, you're going to try harder for Ben.

12:52.258 --> 12:55.614
Oh, you bet you I am, for sure.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.706
Madam Mayor? Madam Mayor.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.647
- Oh, hello.
- I'm sorry to bother you,

13:08.683 --> 13:11.046
but I went to the city manager
to place the order

13:11.082 --> 13:13.415
for the new swing set and he told me

13:13.451 --> 13:15.584
all spending is on hold.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.320
Did he? Well, that's odd.

13:18.356 --> 13:21.423
Perhaps there was a mix-up
in the communication.

13:21.459 --> 13:24.226
You know, he's a little hard
of hearing in his left ear.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.931
Oh. Well, should we call him
and try to clear things up?

13:27.974 --> 13:31.176
No! Uh, let's not bother him
with this, shall we?

13:31.211 --> 13:33.845
I'm sure we'll get
everything straightened out

13:33.880 --> 13:35.680
before swing... season

13:35.716 --> 13:38.850
- comes along.
- When is "swing season"?

13:38.885 --> 13:41.453
Well, it's certainly not tomorrow,

13:41.488 --> 13:44.389
so that gives me at least one more day.

13:47.761 --> 13:50.061
- Hey Sam.
- Well, this is a nice morning surprise.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.797
Well, I thought we could have some tea
and coffee before you went to work.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.467
- And I've got a few minutes; come on in.
- Great!

13:58.004 --> 13:59.904
- Oh! Good morning.
- Hey.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.807
And you're just in time,
'cause the coffee pot's done.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.810
Agh!

14:05.846 --> 14:09.414
Every single time
I forget that's broken.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.983
He always says he's gonna
fix it, but he never does.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.920
Thank you.

14:14.421 --> 14:18.089
- I gotta get to school, so...
- Have fun. Learn stuff.

14:18.125 --> 14:23.328
- Heh. I'll try to do both. Bye.
- Bye.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.331
So, do you wanna go to
a movie Friday night?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.566
- Ben's opening his theatre.
- What's he showing?

14:28.602 --> 14:31.236
- Grace saw it last night.
- It's a romantic comedy.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.004
Oh, like when a guy and meets a girl

14:33.039 --> 14:35.573
and a couple hours later,
they're saying, "I love you"?

14:35.609 --> 14:37.776
Well, I don't know how this one ends.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.844
Well, I hope it ends better than that.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.047
- Do you not believe in romance?
- You know I do.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.718
I just find it hard to believe that
two people fall in love that fast.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.220
So, how long is it supposed
to take for someone to say,

14:49.256 --> 14:50.832
"I love you"?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.841
Longer than it takes to watch a movie.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.845
Sorry.

15:06.597 --> 15:10.575
Doctor Radford. Yeah.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.811
How are his vitals? Oh, good. OK.

15:12.846 --> 15:16.147
No, um, tell him I'm on the way. Thanks.

15:16.183 --> 15:19.284
Hospital. One of my patients
came in with chest pains.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.053
- He's doing better but...
- ...You should go see him.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.157
We'll have to skip this.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.560
Every. Single. Time...

15:36.044 --> 15:39.337
Oh, Grace. It's always good
to see you. Come on in.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.633
Oh. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.262
Now, what can I do for you?

15:46.847 --> 15:50.315
Well, I was just kind of
wondering how a person

15:50.350 --> 15:53.084
might go about getting
money for a city project.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.653
So you're looking for funding.

15:55.689 --> 15:58.923
Yeah. For something
maybe Middleton needs.

15:58.959 --> 16:05.129
Our city funds are
historically low right now.

16:05.615 --> 16:07.098
How low?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.467
We don't have any.

16:09.503 --> 16:12.136
We have enough money to keep
everything running.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.639
We just don't have enough to put
the trees in front of city hall

16:14.674 --> 16:18.142
like we wanted or buy that
new swing set for the park.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.812
Those sound like really good ideas.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.448
- Yes, and they are.
- But we're just going to have to

16:23.483 --> 16:27.903
- get by without them.
- There's nothing you can do?

16:27.938 --> 16:31.155
I'm sorry.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.224
If you'll excuse me, I have to slip out

16:33.260 --> 16:35.293
before Councilwoman Dornati sees me

16:35.328 --> 16:38.129
and asks me to approve something else.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.197
Don't tell anyone I was here.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.161
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.329
How'd your meeting with the mayor go?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.900
Well, she told me something about how
much money the city does and doesn't have

17:15.935 --> 17:18.571
and then she kind of
sneaked out on her tip-toes.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.339
So you won't be making anything
special happen the way you wanted to?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.742
- It doesn't look like it.
- Hmm.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.211
I wish I could be more
like Jenny in the movie

17:27.247 --> 17:30.014
who just got things done
and then had everybody talk

17:30.050 --> 17:32.577
about how great she was
after she did it.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.219
Is that really why she did it?

17:35.255 --> 17:37.290
So she could get all the attention?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.558
No, it actually wasn't.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.628
But after everything that Martha said,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.964
it's all over now, anyways.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.085
Honey, when you get home,
could you do me a favor?

17:51.988 --> 17:53.746
- Sure.
- When we were in the attic

17:53.782 --> 17:57.015
yesterday I saw a box of old newspapers
that needs to go in the recycling.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.244
- You want me to bring it down?
- When you get a chance.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.738
- Yeah. No problem.
- Thanks.

18:02.773 --> 18:05.674
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.325
Hi.

18:13.618 --> 18:16.051
- Hey!
- Oh, hello.

18:16.087 --> 18:18.821
Do you have anything to put,
like, popcorn in?

18:18.856 --> 18:22.524
- Oh. Uh, like a bowl?
- Like some fancy containers.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.895
- I need a whole bunch of them.
- Hmm. I don't think so.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.897
Well, I knew it was
a long shot. It's just...

18:27.932 --> 18:30.232
you sell so many different
things in this place.

18:30.268 --> 18:32.695
I like to keep a variety, just in case.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.664
Well, I need something
that really stands out

18:36.689 --> 18:38.073
because of what's going to be in them.

18:38.109 --> 18:40.709
Well, I'm experimenting with
all kinds of different flavors

18:40.745 --> 18:43.913
so that Ben knows just how much
effort I put into it.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.083
Well, then, I hope you find
the one thing that's perfect.

18:48.119 --> 18:50.185
Yeah, I'll just have to keep looking.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.087
Are you going to the theatre now?

18:52.123 --> 18:54.957
- Yeah, then the grocery store.
- Could you give this to Ben?

18:54.992 --> 18:57.126
- Sure. What is it?
- Oh, it's just a few

18:57.161 --> 18:59.561
odds and ends that I was hoping
someone could put to good use.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.264
I can't wait to see all the work
he's put into the theatre.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.601
- Oh, it is <i> so</i> impressive!
- I just love places like that

19:05.636 --> 19:07.803
with history, you know? You almost think

19:07.838 --> 19:10.572
a famous movie star is going to walk
down the steps and into the lobby

19:10.608 --> 19:13.242
looking all spectacular
and ready for opening night.

19:13.267 --> 19:16.712
Yeah. Well, I just hope that
I'm ready for opening night.

19:16.747 --> 19:18.948
Here ya go.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.917
- See ya later on.
- Yeah.

19:25.256 --> 19:27.222
Thanks for coming, Dr. Radford.

19:27.258 --> 19:29.591
I thought you might like
to see a familiar face.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.790
Is he gonna be all right?

19:30.815 --> 19:32.561
Well, the attending said
it wasn't a heart attack.

19:32.596 --> 19:34.527
How come it felt like one?

19:34.552 --> 19:36.165
Because it might have
been a slight arrhythmia,

19:36.200 --> 19:38.167
which can indicate weakness, or damage.

19:38.202 --> 19:41.070
That's why they want to take you
upstairs for more tests.

19:41.105 --> 19:44.673
- Is that what you'd recommend?
- That's the right thing to do.

19:44.709 --> 19:46.669
But I'll be right here
when you come out.

19:49.613 --> 19:52.614
Take Mister Rossi up to, uh,
third floor, outpatient, please.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.970
- Take good care of him.
- They will.

19:57.254 --> 19:58.681
I love you.

20:00.337 --> 20:02.905
Love you, too.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.271
- All fixed.
- You know you don't have to

20:23.305 --> 20:25.271
keep coming here
and doing free work for me.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.209
I've been working for free?

20:28.677 --> 20:32.011
- Maybe I can pay you in movie tickets.
- Sounds like a fair trade,

20:32.047 --> 20:36.449
but it's been fun.
I'm glad you needed a helper.

20:39.254 --> 20:43.456
- Look what I found!
- Where did you find that?

20:43.492 --> 20:46.025
Behind some boxes in the
storage room under the stairs.

20:48.363 --> 20:51.297
Cassie was talking about some
movie stars coming down them

20:51.333 --> 20:53.466
and I wanted to see
what was under there.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.027
- Does it still work?
- All I need is for the light to work.

20:57.062 --> 21:00.406
I'm gonna make the popcorn at the Bistro,
but I wanted to display it in here

21:00.442 --> 21:03.676
- so things don't look so plain.
- Plain isn't always a bad thing.

21:03.712 --> 21:05.879
But you deserve more than that.

21:05.914 --> 21:09.148
Which is why I'm going to
make it more special.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.818
Wow.

21:18.727 --> 21:21.160
OK.

21:23.231 --> 21:24.600
Hmm.

21:25.734 --> 21:27.061
Hmm!

21:36.745 --> 21:38.531
My piggy bank.

21:54.963 --> 21:56.963
Madam Mayor!

21:56.998 --> 22:00.733
Shh! I don't want anyone
to know that I'm here.

22:00.769 --> 22:03.069
We need to tell the council members
about our financial shortfall.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.438
And see the disappointed
looks on their faces

22:05.473 --> 22:07.640
when they learn that I've let them down?

22:07.676 --> 22:11.144
- I could put it in a memo.
- But I'd still feel the shame.

22:11.179 --> 22:13.753
And what should I tell people
who want to speak with you?

22:13.778 --> 22:14.743
Oh, I don't know!

22:14.779 --> 22:18.362
Make something up. Just don't
let them know I was here.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.591
Jared!

22:24.626 --> 22:26.726
I need to speak to the mayor
about the sidewalks

22:26.761 --> 22:28.080
outside my shop.

22:28.830 --> 22:32.632
- She's not here.
- I just saw her.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.735
No. No. That, um...

22:35.770 --> 22:37.770
That was her... daughter.

22:38.174 --> 22:39.706
She doesn't have a daughter.

22:39.741 --> 22:42.809
- She just adopted one.
- That looks just like her?

22:42.844 --> 22:46.346
I know! They grow up so fast!

22:53.655 --> 22:56.656
Sam! It's good to see you out and about.

22:56.691 --> 22:59.792
Well, I try to see the
sunshine at least once a day.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.662
- What's all that?
- Oh!

23:02.697 --> 23:05.064
Popcorn toppings that no one's
even dreamed of yet.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.017
You're going to be
at the theatre opening, right?

23:07.042 --> 23:08.334
Cassie invited me, yep.

23:08.370 --> 23:11.037
Well, I just want to make sure
Ben knows how extra special

23:11.072 --> 23:13.773
- he is to me.
- So you'll say it with popcorn.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.109
Food has always been one of the ways

23:16.144 --> 23:18.811
- I show Ben how much I care.
- Huh.

23:18.847 --> 23:22.215
My mom was the same way.
I guess it was easier to hand us a plate

23:22.250 --> 23:24.484
than actually say the words.

23:24.519 --> 23:27.620
Well, I gotta get going,
but I'll see you at the movies!

23:27.656 --> 23:29.934
- It's supposed to be a great show.
- Yeah.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.616
Oh! Jared.

23:38.867 --> 23:40.566
Hi. Um,

23:40.602 --> 23:44.037
is Mayor Tinsdale in today?
I've been looking all over.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.873
No, she's at home, avoiding people.

23:46.908 --> 23:51.210
I mean, taking some personal time.
Which is fine, you know,

23:51.246 --> 23:53.746
since it gives me some time to recycle

23:53.782 --> 23:57.550
- all these city budgets from years ago.
- Oh. You're recycling?

23:57.585 --> 23:59.986
Yeah. We print up these for
the townspeople to look at,

24:00.021 --> 24:02.466
but hardly anyone's ever
looked them over.

24:03.131 --> 24:04.691
Could I look them over?

24:05.427 --> 24:08.327
Don't see why not, but I don't
know what you're looking for.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.140
Me either!

24:11.800 --> 24:13.435
Thanks!

24:14.812 --> 24:18.004
I know you had quite a scare,
but sometimes that's good.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.782
That gives us a chance to

24:19.807 --> 24:22.320
get ahead of things before you
do any damage to your heart.

24:22.355 --> 24:24.343
Well, I'll take whatever
pill you tell me to.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.412
There are medications
that can help, but I think

24:26.448 --> 24:28.781
we're talking about
a lifestyle change, mostly.

24:28.817 --> 24:31.884
Oh, no. Is this the
"no more red meat" speech

24:31.920 --> 24:34.056
I was hoping I wasn't going
to get 'til I turned sixty?

24:34.081 --> 24:35.254
You're gonna have to cut back.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.724
Yeah. Those are hard words
for a man who loves his steak.

24:37.759 --> 24:39.726
And you're gonna have to exercise more.

24:39.761 --> 24:42.895
- Three times a week.
- I'll do whatever it takes.

24:42.931 --> 24:45.598
Yeah. Well, I'm sure your wife will

24:45.633 --> 24:47.900
enjoy having those extra years with you.

24:47.936 --> 24:49.469
Yeah. I hope so.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.099
I'm so lucky to have her.

24:54.943 --> 24:56.478
Make sure you tell her.

25:04.919 --> 25:07.787
Heat this up in the microwave
and apply it twice a day

25:07.822 --> 25:10.159
and you'll forget
your shoulder was even hurting.

25:12.293 --> 25:15.061
Stephanie. Can I help you
find something?

25:15.096 --> 25:17.663
Yeah, I know it's a long shot,
but do you happen to

25:17.699 --> 25:20.600
- have any light bulbs?
- Ooh. I have candles.

25:20.635 --> 25:22.935
Yeah, I need a light bulb
for my popcorn machine.

25:22.971 --> 25:25.104
I've been to three different stores!
I can't find the right size.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.640
- What size do you need?
- Well, uh...

25:27.675 --> 25:30.476
I need something
that would fit perfectly

25:30.512 --> 25:33.346
into something like this.
Same height, same size around...

25:33.381 --> 25:36.949
Oh, sorry, the only thing I
have that fits in there is salt.

25:36.985 --> 25:39.685
- For the shaker.
- Ohhh,

25:39.721 --> 25:42.955
it's a salt shaker! It's not very fancy.

25:42.991 --> 25:47.660
- Well, it's for salt.
- I guess what I mean is that

25:47.695 --> 25:50.329
most things you have in here are
a lot more special than this.

25:50.365 --> 25:52.064
That salt shaker does its job

25:52.100 --> 25:54.867
exactly the way it's supposed to.
It sprinkles on something

25:54.903 --> 25:58.504
that accents the dish rather
than stand out on its own.

25:58.832 --> 26:00.209
Huh.

26:05.714 --> 26:07.777
Knock-knock.

26:07.802 --> 26:09.515
- Sam.
- Grace let me in.

26:09.551 --> 26:12.148
You know you can just
come in anytime you want.

26:12.184 --> 26:15.955
- Yeah, well, you know, manners.
- Which are never a bad thing.

26:15.990 --> 26:18.601
I brought my own coffee, in case you
wanted to make yourself a cup of...

26:18.636 --> 26:21.313
...that.

26:22.997 --> 26:25.998
Well, your timing is perfect.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.302
Oh, what happened with the patient
you went to see at the hospital?

26:29.337 --> 26:31.737
Oh, he's great. I talked to
him today, actually.

26:31.773 --> 26:35.077
He was telling me all about how he...

26:35.777 --> 26:39.378
Well, he's just really in love
with his wife, that's all.

26:39.414 --> 26:42.515
It's always nice to hear about
a man who feels that way.

26:42.918 --> 26:44.169
Yeah.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.154
Sam.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.690
Is there something on your mind?

26:53.895 --> 26:56.996
I just wanted to see you, that's all.

27:08.210 --> 27:11.278
- Morning.
- Morning, yeah.

27:14.917 --> 27:18.585
Hey. When did this start working?

27:18.620 --> 27:21.611
- Right after I fixed it.
- You fixed it?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.491
Yeah. I picked up
a few skills at the theatre

27:24.526 --> 27:26.493
so I thought I'd bring
them home and use them here.

27:26.528 --> 27:29.462
Well, how did you find hinges
to match these exactly?

27:30.357 --> 27:32.999
Stephanie said Cassie picked
them out from her store.

27:35.504 --> 27:39.506
Well, she found the right
ones. And you did a great job.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.477
Thanks.

27:43.779 --> 27:46.746
Are you actually going to
take a cup out of there?

27:46.782 --> 27:50.851
- Let me admire my son's work.
- Enjoy.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.759
Psst!

28:02.064 --> 28:05.271
- Cassie!
- Martha?

28:05.307 --> 28:08.702
Shh! Don't say my name so loudly.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.739
Are there any city council
members who might have come in

28:12.774 --> 28:15.505
- when I wasn't looking?
- I don't see any.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.612
Oh, thank goodness. I've been
avoiding them all week.

28:18.647 --> 28:21.581
Dealing with the harsh
realities of being the mayor?

28:21.617 --> 28:24.184
Only because I said "yes"
to too many good things.

28:24.219 --> 28:26.620
Because I want the decisions
of my administration

28:26.655 --> 28:29.689
- to outlive even me.
- Well, I'm sure the next generation

28:29.725 --> 28:31.858
will take into account
everything that you've done.

28:32.622 --> 28:34.280
If there's anything to take account of.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.464
I heard Stephanie saying she
was taking her concessions to

28:37.499 --> 28:40.133
the theatre. I'm sure
she could use a hand.

28:40.168 --> 28:42.635
- That's an excellent idea.
- To get me away from anybody

28:42.671 --> 28:45.904
- I don't want to see.
- And to help out a friend.

28:45.940 --> 28:48.126
What? Oh, yes. Of course.

28:51.513 --> 28:54.080
My! Those look spectacular.

28:54.116 --> 28:56.883
I know! I mean, thank you.

28:56.918 --> 28:59.352
Cassie said you might need
some help getting it all

28:59.388 --> 29:02.155
- over to the theatre?
- That is so sweet!

29:02.190 --> 29:06.186
- No snacking on the way.
- I'll try to resist.

29:09.197 --> 29:11.097
There's Councilwoman Talley.
Quick, load me up with another

29:11.133 --> 29:14.434
- box so she can't see me.
- OK, here.

29:16.371 --> 29:18.323
Thanks.

29:29.217 --> 29:31.451
- Oh, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

29:31.486 --> 29:33.353
Hey, did you know there's
a bank in Middleton

29:33.388 --> 29:36.956
- that's over a hundred years old?
- In the brick building, yeah.

29:36.992 --> 29:40.226
- I've never been in there before.
- Why were you in there today?

29:40.262 --> 29:41.847
Well, I found...

29:44.266 --> 29:45.965
That is a little bit of a secret.

29:46.001 --> 29:48.134
Oh, my daughter's keeping
secrets from me now?

29:48.170 --> 29:50.603
You'll probably find out
eventually, but for now,

29:50.639 --> 29:53.473
- I'm not saying a word.
- Then I won't ask.

29:53.508 --> 29:55.241
Are you excited about seeing
the movie again tonight?

29:55.277 --> 29:58.244
Yes! And if everything goes
well, right before it starts,

29:58.280 --> 30:02.582
the mayor will be able to
announce something very special.

30:11.126 --> 30:14.661
Oh, Ben!

30:14.696 --> 30:18.131
You've done wonderful work.

30:18.166 --> 30:21.328
The Middleton Theatre is just
about ready for its close-up!

30:21.364 --> 30:23.770
Thanks. I'm looking forward to
people seeing what I've done.

30:23.805 --> 30:26.306
I couldn't have done it,
though, without this guy.

30:26.767 --> 30:29.676
There, that's the last of them. And now,

30:29.711 --> 30:32.812
to see how they look... Ta-da!

30:32.848 --> 30:35.315
Those look wonderful under the lights!

30:35.350 --> 30:38.618
Right? I found some bulbs in
a box in the projector room.

30:38.987 --> 30:40.487
The box from Cassie's attic?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.956
Those things were from Grey House?

30:43.450 --> 30:45.695
They were the only bulbs
I could find that fit.

30:46.370 --> 30:48.328
Is this cart "all you can eat"?

30:48.363 --> 30:50.330
You can help yourself.

30:50.365 --> 30:52.432
There's Parmesan garlic,

30:52.467 --> 30:54.767
salted caramel, bacon-cheddar...

30:54.803 --> 30:57.829
I didn't know popcorn
came in so many flavors.

30:57.864 --> 31:00.306
I know. I really outdid myself.

31:00.342 --> 31:02.475
What kind are you looking for?

31:02.511 --> 31:04.310
Oh, uh, I was hoping you had plain.

31:04.346 --> 31:08.481
Oh. I didn't want to do just
plain for such a special event.

31:08.517 --> 31:11.451
Hmm, I really wanted just plain.

31:11.486 --> 31:13.653
But I have so many different kinds.

31:13.688 --> 31:16.189
Yes, all fighting for my attention

31:16.224 --> 31:19.292
when tonight I'm just going to
want to be watching the movie

31:19.327 --> 31:22.695
and nibbling on something a
little less, well obtrusive.

31:22.731 --> 31:25.331
After all, it's not
the popcorn that's the star

31:25.367 --> 31:27.467
of the show. It's the show.

31:31.606 --> 31:34.974
Here you go. I'm sure she'll say yes.

31:36.711 --> 31:39.579
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

31:39.614 --> 31:41.347
- Need more candies for Eve?
- Actually,

31:41.383 --> 31:44.350
I would like some more for me.
Best lunch I had all week.

31:44.386 --> 31:46.586
Oh, well, I'll get you another box.

31:46.621 --> 31:50.757
- You sell a lot of these?
- Every single day.

31:50.792 --> 31:52.992
But that is the beginning
of the end, right there.

31:53.028 --> 31:54.761
- What?
- That.

31:54.796 --> 31:57.163
Well, how many people
have you said, "I love you" to?

31:57.199 --> 32:00.610
- Just a few.
- Are you still with any of them?

32:01.695 --> 32:05.672
There you go. I've been told
"I love you" by so many people

32:05.707 --> 32:07.674
that those words don't even
mean anything anymore.

32:08.493 --> 32:11.144
Those words will always mean something.

32:11.663 --> 32:12.879
Well,

32:13.123 --> 32:15.381
then I'll leave it to
you and the balloons.

32:31.666 --> 32:34.467
Sorry.

32:34.502 --> 32:36.869
Like mother, like daughter.

32:36.905 --> 32:39.906
I thought I could sneak in here
without getting caught.

32:39.941 --> 32:45.044
I wasn't trying to catch you.
I just need you to look at this.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.614
Oh, what is it? Oh. Numbers.

32:47.649 --> 32:50.783
Nobody who works in city government
should ever have to look at numbers.

32:50.819 --> 32:54.654
Except those are good numbers.
Especially...

32:56.658 --> 32:59.092
- this one.
- How so?

32:59.728 --> 33:01.327
It's a bank account that everybody

33:01.363 --> 33:04.130
seems to have forgotten about.
I found it while I was looking at

33:04.165 --> 33:07.667
old budgets that were about
to be recycled. But...

33:08.678 --> 33:11.304
I ended up finding
a piggy bank in there.

33:11.339 --> 33:13.439
We used to keep city
money in a piggy bank?

33:13.475 --> 33:16.370
No, but you had a benevolent fund.

33:17.229 --> 33:20.446
You know, I do remember
hearing that the city did

33:20.482 --> 33:23.416
used to have one, once, but that
account has been closed for,

33:23.451 --> 33:26.119
well, at least thirty or forty years.

33:26.154 --> 33:29.022
- Except it wasn't.
- Because there it is!

33:31.743 --> 33:35.595
Oh my goodness, it's as if
you found a buried treasure!

33:35.630 --> 33:37.764
There's more than enough
money in there to plant

33:37.799 --> 33:39.966
some trees and buy a new swing set,

33:40.001 --> 33:42.335
- don't you think?
- Yes. Yes, there is!

33:42.370 --> 33:44.470
I'm gonna give all the credit to you.

33:44.506 --> 33:47.674
Special recognition, at our
next city council meeting.

33:47.709 --> 33:52.307
Thank you. But no.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.515
I didn't do it for the attention.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.484
I just wanted to make a difference,

33:58.520 --> 34:00.021
and to get things done.

34:01.323 --> 34:04.957
You really are becoming more
like your mother every day.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.660
And that is the nicest thing

34:07.696 --> 34:09.864
you could have ever said.

34:21.275 --> 34:22.585
It's OK...

34:23.879 --> 34:25.511
You're going to be OK.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.318
Just take a minute.
Then you'll be feeling better.

34:34.556 --> 34:37.090
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll stay here with you...

34:37.809 --> 34:39.992
Until you're ready to soar.

35:00.348 --> 35:04.017
I did not know this many people
would want to come and see a movie.

35:04.052 --> 35:06.986
Yeah. I just hope that nobody
smudges up that handrail.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.674
I spent a lot of time trying
to make that thing look good.

35:10.317 --> 35:13.553
They're going to smudge it up,
Nick. It's a handrail.

35:14.462 --> 35:16.563
Nobody appreciates great art.

35:16.598 --> 35:21.267
- Popcorn, get your popcorn!
- There's only one kind.

35:21.303 --> 35:23.736
Yep. Plain.

35:23.772 --> 35:26.005
I decided that the concessions
aren't supposed to

35:26.041 --> 35:28.408
take over the whole night. They're...

35:28.443 --> 35:30.510
just supposed to accent
what is already here.

35:31.112 --> 35:34.514
That way, the star of the show can be

35:34.549 --> 35:36.368
the star of the show.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.853
- Glad I made it.
- Hey! Yeah, just in time.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.922
There you are.

35:42.958 --> 35:45.525
- Thank you!
- Can we just share your popcorn?

35:45.560 --> 35:48.795
Oh, I'm a little
protective of my snacks.

35:48.830 --> 35:52.065
- OK, I'll have my own. Thank you.
- That's a really good idea.

35:52.100 --> 35:55.068
Yoo-hoo! Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

35:55.103 --> 36:00.073
Now, first of all, I want to
acknowledge Ben Patterson,

36:00.517 --> 36:02.609
whose determination and craftsmanship

36:02.644 --> 36:05.278
are the reasons all of us are here.

36:09.451 --> 36:11.584
Before we get to
the lighting of the marquee,

36:11.620 --> 36:13.586
I wanted to make a special announcement.

36:13.622 --> 36:15.822
Many of you have been
wondering when we'll be

36:15.857 --> 36:17.924
getting the new trees
in front of city hall

36:17.959 --> 36:21.594
and I'm very pleased to announce
that they are fully funded

36:21.630 --> 36:24.374
and will be planted next week.

36:27.002 --> 36:30.136
And I just placed an order
for a new swing set

36:30.171 --> 36:34.574
for the park, which will be
arriving very soon, as well,

36:34.609 --> 36:38.177
all because of the fortitude
of one Middletonian

36:38.213 --> 36:41.247
who wishes to remain anonymous.

36:43.018 --> 36:45.952
So, now, everyone! If we can
all move out here, please,

36:45.987 --> 36:50.123
for a better look. That's right,
fill in. Here we are.

36:50.158 --> 36:53.126
Are we ready? Alright, then.

36:53.161 --> 36:57.163
Here we go. Three, two, one.

36:57.198 --> 36:59.165
Lights!

37:05.040 --> 37:07.460
It gives me great pleasure
to be able to say:

37:07.495 --> 37:10.643
let's go to the movies, Middleton!

37:18.653 --> 37:20.340
What's this movie about, anyway?

37:20.375 --> 37:24.057
Oh, I think the title says it all.

37:42.544 --> 37:45.311
Well, I hope you're in the mood
for a romantic comedy.

37:45.346 --> 37:49.148
- I actually am.
- And I'm ready for this one

37:49.184 --> 37:51.002
to surprise me, for a change.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.838
Shh!

38:19.981 --> 38:22.949
<i>You're a funny girl, Jenny.
You read "Aesop's Fables"</i>

38:22.984 --> 38:25.451
<i>and you won't accept anything
but candy, fruit, and flowers.</i>

38:25.487 --> 38:28.287
<i>And hospitality. Of the right sort.</i>

38:28.323 --> 38:31.591
<i>But I want to know that
I'm doing the right thing.</i>

38:31.626 --> 38:35.294
<i>- For the town and for everybody.
- How can you be sure?</i>

38:35.330 --> 38:38.231
<i>There's something in here that
tells me if I'm right or wrong.</i>

38:38.266 --> 38:41.300
<i>If it's still, then it's all
right. But if it flutters...</i>

38:41.336 --> 38:44.303
<i>- it's wrong.
- Oh, but you, Jenny.</i>

38:44.339 --> 38:46.372
<i>You're different. You're
not like any other</i>

38:46.407 --> 38:50.243
<i>woman I've ever known before.
You're a dream. A poem.</i>

38:50.278 --> 38:52.545
<i>You're like a dewy white flower
waiting to be crushed.</i>

39:00.255 --> 39:02.474
<i>...then you cheated Mr.
Dayton, but you better give him</i>

39:02.509 --> 39:04.183
<i>back that option because if you don't, </i>

39:04.208 --> 39:06.259
<i>someday you'll have
a flutter in your stomach.</i>

39:06.294 --> 39:09.762
<i>I've been having flutters all my life.</i>

39:09.798 --> 39:11.697
<i>Why else would I have three doctors?</i>

39:11.733 --> 39:14.267
<i>You don't need a doctor for a flutter.
That's just your conscience</i>

39:14.302 --> 39:16.269
<i>telling you what to do only you
don't pay any attention to it!</i>

39:16.304 --> 39:20.072
<i>Because you've been ready to
say, "I love you" for too long</i>

39:20.108 --> 39:22.241
<i>and there's no good reason why
you haven't said it.</i>

39:22.277 --> 39:26.312
<i>- The reason is it didn't last.
- Well, maybe you've never</i>

39:26.347 --> 39:28.314
<i>said it to the right person.</i>

39:28.349 --> 39:33.820
<i>Jeffers, this is very important.
Tell Mrs. Brand she's...</i>

39:39.527 --> 39:41.828
So, what did you think?

39:41.863 --> 39:43.863
I actually liked it better
than I thought I would.

39:43.898 --> 39:45.865
A lot can happen during a movie.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.867
- Where are you parked?
- Right over there.

39:47.902 --> 39:51.137
- Oh. Wanna give me a ride home?
- I thought you had your car?

39:51.172 --> 39:54.106
I do. I'd rather ride with you.

39:54.142 --> 39:58.311
OK.

40:01.816 --> 40:05.318
What a beautiful night.

40:05.353 --> 40:09.355
- Yeah. I really did enjoy it.
- Hey, you don't have a key box

40:09.390 --> 40:11.220
on your door you need me
to help you open, do you?

40:11.245 --> 40:12.558
I don't, no.

40:12.594 --> 40:16.629
Good, because we'd end up
stuck out here forever.

40:16.664 --> 40:20.695
Hey, I was thinking
about you... and us...

40:21.368 --> 40:23.903
and the fact you wouldn't even
share your popcorn with me.

40:23.938 --> 40:26.806
You've now seen one of my darker sides.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.642
It's everything else

40:29.677 --> 40:32.311
about you that makes me...

40:33.915 --> 40:35.917
You just make me want to be better.

40:36.743 --> 40:39.170
You're one of the best
people I've ever known.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.021
You know how hard I have to
work at being that way?

40:42.056 --> 40:43.591
And everything comes so
naturally to you.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.927
All I know is

40:46.761 --> 40:50.473
I look forward to every minute
whenever I'm with you.

40:51.566 --> 40:54.227
So stick around, OK?

40:55.303 --> 40:56.729
I'm not going anywhere.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.739
I love you.

41:07.782 --> 41:09.325
I love you, too.

41:12.420 --> 41:16.455
- Then that's good, huh?
- Yeah.
