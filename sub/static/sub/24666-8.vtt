00:11.890 --> 00:13.860
You think animals are sentient?

00:13.890 --> 00:15.690
I think pain is, you know...

00:15.720 --> 00:17.100
- Pain...
- Pain is pain.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.410
If you don't respond to that,

00:18.450 --> 00:19.753
you're doing something
seriously wrong.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.240
That's very Buddhist of you,
I think.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.110
Look, when I worked in Cape Cod,

00:23.140 --> 00:25.730
my job was to load
this steamer with lobsters.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.600
And they don't scream,
but, you know,

00:27.630 --> 00:30.120
you hear them scratching
against the thing.

00:30.150 --> 00:31.453
I'd have dreams, and, I mean,
I'm in a sauna

00:31.460 --> 00:32.880
and I look through the window

00:32.910 --> 00:34.013
and there's this giant lobster,

00:34.020 --> 00:37.290
like a... you know, a bib
with a chef on it, you know.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.150
Bhutan,

01:39.180 --> 01:41.360
a remote,
relatively rarely visited

01:41.390 --> 01:44.840
kingdom of myth and legend
high in the Himalayas,

01:44.880 --> 01:47.880
known as
Land of the Thunder Dragon.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.860
One of the reasons it's not
on the tourist trail

01:56.890 --> 01:59.380
is it's hard to get to.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.290
Flying in,
you hang on to your seat

02:12.320 --> 02:15.320
as the plane negotiates
some alarming maneuvers

02:15.360 --> 02:17.530
through narrow
mountain passes...

02:19.260 --> 02:20.850
Before dropping
into the country's

02:20.880 --> 02:22.710
only international airport,

02:22.740 --> 02:25.640
said by some to be the most
dangerous in the world.

02:49.050 --> 02:51.360
Located between India and Tibet,

02:51.390 --> 02:53.330
Bhutan, about the size
of Switzerland,

02:53.360 --> 02:56.330
is caught between
the old world and the new.

03:01.580 --> 03:04.680
Thimphu is Bhutan's capital
and largest city.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.450
It has a rapidly growing
population of 100,000,

03:08.480 --> 03:11.860
as Bhutanese have begun
the inevitable move away

03:11.900 --> 03:14.040
from a rural,
agrarian lifestyle.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.460
Tourism was only allowed
starting in the 1970s.

03:22.490 --> 03:25.570
The amount of foreign visitors
each year is strictly limited

03:25.600 --> 03:29.740
to protect Bhutan's culture
and environment.

03:29.780 --> 03:34.470
There are no Starbucks,
no KFCs, no King or Clown.

03:34.510 --> 03:37.790
Basically, they don't
want you to come here...

03:37.820 --> 03:40.820
at least en masse.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.070
- Watch your head.
- Yeah, right? Wow.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.413
What do you think of
the altitude? How you feeling?

03:49.420 --> 03:51.070
I'm here because of this guy,

03:51.110 --> 03:54.280
my friend, a film director,
Darren Aronofsky,

03:54.320 --> 03:57.490
fresh off the unjustifiably
horrified reaction

03:57.530 --> 04:00.640
to what I think is
his masterpiece, "Mother!"

04:00.670 --> 04:03.500
I don't know if you've studied
the effects of high altitude.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.740
You know, your blood
gets thicker and thicker

04:05.780 --> 04:07.780
until it's like
freakin' marmalade.

04:07.820 --> 04:09.750
- All right.
- We'll be dying slowly.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.100
Awesome.

04:12.130 --> 04:14.620
"Mother!" is an angry
and thinly veiled warning

04:14.650 --> 04:17.100
that we are destroying
our planet.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.970
And, policy wise,
Bhutan is something

04:20.000 --> 04:22.310
of an environmental wonderland.

04:22.350 --> 04:25.830
You want to protect the country
from being overly influenced

04:25.870 --> 04:28.420
by foreign values,
culture, you know,

04:28.460 --> 04:30.460
all of the bad stuff
that happens with tourism.

04:30.490 --> 04:32.770
Has anyone made a film here?
I don't know.

04:32.810 --> 04:34.460
It's got to be hard
to work here.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.460
Yeah, plus talk
about contaminating

04:36.500 --> 04:38.153
the values of a local culture,
I mean, I don't... that'll...

04:38.160 --> 04:39.737
What, we are... Hollywood
doesn't do that.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.680
Our first meal
becomes our go-to favorite

04:43.710 --> 04:46.340
for the rest of the trip.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.060
If I'm not on camera,
chances are I'm somewhere

04:49.100 --> 04:50.890
eating these bad boys.

04:50.930 --> 04:53.410
- Momo!
- Momos.

04:53.450 --> 04:56.830
Plump, flavorful,
often quite spicy dumplings

04:56.860 --> 04:59.630
filled with meat, cheese,
or veg.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.390
Did I mention Darren
is a vegetarian?

05:03.420 --> 05:05.840
- God damn, these are good.
- They are really good.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.080
- Try chili cheese momo?
- Pardon?

05:08.120 --> 05:09.880
- Chili cheese momo.
- Cheese momo?

05:09.910 --> 05:12.540
- Chili cheese.
- Hot, very hot.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.360
- Wow, everybody's smiling.
- The thing to do.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.570
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

05:20.130 --> 05:22.820
- Mmm.
- That's excellent.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.820
Yeah.

05:24.860 --> 05:26.380
That's spicy.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.613
That is... yeah,
I'm feeling that.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.900
Mmm. I feel it
in the back of my head.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.420
It's enlightenment.

05:31.450 --> 05:33.000
It's your third eye
opening, man.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.513
I can't even tell what
we're talking about,

05:34.520 --> 05:36.590
I'm, like, so high
from the altitude.

05:57.170 --> 05:58.720
Morning in Bhutan's capital.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.620
A kingdom
that has existed contentedly

06:01.650 --> 06:05.860
in a state of self-imposed
isolation for centuries.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.560
In some forms of Buddhism
you're very much...

06:13.600 --> 06:15.700
This life does not matter
at all, it's about the next.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.050
Next.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.113
But on the other extreme,

06:18.120 --> 06:20.570
it's all about today, right now.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.570
The form of Buddhism practiced
here is the Middle Path.

06:25.610 --> 06:28.580
Middle Path.
Mahayana Buddhism.

06:31.610 --> 06:33.550
Buddhists consider
the next life.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.890
Yes, and always is your karma.

06:35.930 --> 06:37.450
And karma.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.730
Whatever tragedies fall on you,

06:39.760 --> 06:41.660
that's the family of karma.

06:41.690 --> 06:45.590
It's all about an attitude,
pick up and move on.

06:54.150 --> 06:56.190
Once, his holiness
the Dalai Lama

06:56.220 --> 06:59.260
told me, "Every day
when you rise up",

06:59.300 --> 07:02.610
"you try and be a good
a human being as possible.

07:02.650 --> 07:05.610
That more important
than being religious."

07:33.570 --> 07:35.510
- Beautiful day today.
- Winter days...

07:35.540 --> 07:37.130
- Yeah.
- Are normally like this

07:37.160 --> 07:38.540
every day.

07:38.580 --> 07:39.913
In the good old days,
we used to have

07:39.920 --> 07:41.960
snowfalls about four,
five times a year.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.790
- Mm-hmm.
- But over the last decade

07:43.820 --> 07:47.210
or so, it's decreased a lot.
Noticeably, really?

07:47.240 --> 07:50.040
Some glacier lakes have
disappeared completely.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.520
Dasho Benji Dorji is known as

07:52.560 --> 07:55.560
Bhutan's godfather
of environmental conservation.

07:55.590 --> 07:58.530
And in Tantric Buddhism,
is there a respect for nature?

07:58.560 --> 08:01.080
- There is a lot of respect.
- You don't mess with nature.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.640
Yeah, you don't
mess with nature.

08:03.670 --> 08:06.570
This is a traditional
welcome drink, is an ara.

08:06.610 --> 08:07.990
It's raw alcohol.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.330
The normal toast
is "tashi delek."

08:10.370 --> 08:11.820
- Tashi delek.
- Tashi delek.

08:11.850 --> 08:14.060
May good fortune be with you.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.030
I'm a retired alcoholic,
so I will not join you.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.340
Okay. Mmm.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.760
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.590
Kind of a warm sake
but made out of wheat.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.000
- Yeah.
- Yes.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.900
If you could tell us
a little more about the chef.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.700
Oh, she and her husband
are both colonels

08:29.730 --> 08:32.110
in the Royal Bhutan Police.
Oh, wow.

08:32.150 --> 08:33.740
We have to use the finger.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.570
Touch, so that
the flavors come out.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.570
These recipes,
where do they come from?

08:38.600 --> 08:41.360
They come from the farms,
from all the local houses.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.780
Just passed down.

08:42.809 --> 08:44.710
These nine grains
have a very historical

08:44.750 --> 08:46.370
and spiritual significance.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.130
There was one saint
called Drukpa Kunley,

08:49.170 --> 08:51.100
he's known as the Madman.
The Divine Madman.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.270
Yes, of course.

08:52.310 --> 08:56.380
So when he came to Bhutan,
he carried the nine grains.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.870
This is the hide, the yak hide.
Mm. Yes.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.730
Hot Sichuan pepper.

09:04.770 --> 09:09.220
Lots of tomatoes
to tone down the pepper.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.050

Mm.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.650

It's true.
Yeah, but, we don't...

09:38.390 --> 09:41.800
We don't actually believe that,
but please proceed.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.430
I do believe in
Gross National Happiness.

Good governance, human rights,

09:46.670 --> 09:49.610
justice for all,
education, health.

09:50.470 --> 09:52.300
It is not a wealthy country.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.160
The average daily wage
is very low.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.780

09:55.820 --> 09:57.370
the average person
living in Bhutan

09:57.410 --> 10:00.170
is reasonably happy and content?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.270
Most people, yes.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.443
Bhutan is

Bhutan is a very

and in such circumstances,
I always do my very best

11:47.860 --> 11:49.410
to be respectful and restrained,

11:49.450 --> 11:52.280
shying away from my usual

Never in the history

How to talk about what's
happening without, uh...

12:02.810 --> 12:05.780
well, without making
the obvious joke.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.780
God, give me strength,
as we wander through

12:08.810 --> 12:10.780
the valley of the low-hanging
dick jokes.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.440
I'm trying to be respectful

12:12.470 --> 12:14.890
of a five-century
religious tradition here.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.060
For centuries, Bhutan
has celebrated

12:18.100 --> 12:20.510
the, um... phallus.

12:20.550 --> 12:22.240
Uh, I'm not sure
about the teeth.

12:23.340 --> 12:26.110
This is the necklace ones.
Ooh.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.525
I'm trying to think
of a circumstance

12:27.560 --> 12:28.933
that you could wear
that around your neck.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.320
You see them everywhere here.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.910
Ah, jeez, it's a cock-alanche.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.980
You could make a chess set
out of them, though.

12:36.010 --> 12:38.500
Really, my dick
takes your schnatz.

12:38.530 --> 12:39.980
Exactly.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.353
Yeah, that's a little...
Yeah, that's...

12:41.360 --> 12:42.850
That's making a statement
of some...

12:42.880 --> 12:45.850
Yeah, it is. It is.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.440
All right, I got to go

Rainbow dick.
Five, six...

I want to see this appearing
on the budget, by the way.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.310
Exactly.
How do you write this off?

12:55.340 --> 12:57.520
Do I add a little tip?
N-

13:01.420 --> 13:03.413

I'm not walking around with it.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.280
I mean, I'm holding two...

13:05.320 --> 13:07.010

13:07.040 --> 13:08.940
Tell me what they represent.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.390
Uh, embarrassment?
All right.

13:13.430 --> 13:16.500
All this is the legacy
of Drukpa Kunley,

13:16.540 --> 13:19.990
a lama and holy man
who lived 500 years ago

13:20.020 --> 13:22.020
and spread the tenets
of Buddhism

13:22.060 --> 13:23.850
along with a healthy skepticism

13:23.890 --> 13:26.130
for the institutions of power.

13:26.170 --> 13:29.070
We are sitting just below
the Chimi Lhakhang

13:29.100 --> 13:31.590
which is a temple built
in the honor of Drukpa Kunley.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.000
The temple's also known
as the Temple of Fertility.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.970
He reveled unapologetically
in casual sex,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.870
the copious use of spirits,
and seduction,

13:39.900 --> 13:42.530
smiting demons
and making frequent friends

13:42.560 --> 13:44.050
with what is referred to

13:44.080 --> 13:47.530
as his Flaming Thunderbolt
of Wisdom,

13:47.570 --> 13:50.980
which is a term you and I
are unlikely to get away with.

13:51.020 --> 13:52.920
People from all over
the world come here

13:52.950 --> 13:54.880
to buy wooden penises...
Yeah.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.633
And to hear the stories
of the Divine Madman.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.433
And to get the, yeah,
blessings from the palace.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.890
The Phallus Palace.
Phallus Palace.

14:00.930 --> 14:03.410
They bless you with a phallus?
With a phallus, yeah.

14:05.410 --> 14:08.420
Kunga Tenzin Dorji is
a journalist and radio host

14:08.450 --> 14:11.070
who knows a few things
about the Divine Madman.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.700
The phallus has been
a symbol in Vajrayana Buddhism

14:13.730 --> 14:15.560
long before Drukpa Kunley
came around.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.600
It's just that because
he was such a character,

14:17.630 --> 14:19.980
it's come
to be associated with him.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.910
The Divine Madman was a rebel.

14:21.950 --> 14:24.430
Questioned his own religion.
Mmhmm.

14:24.470 --> 14:26.090
His own... his fellow monks.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.540
So the monks hated him,
of course,

14:27.570 --> 14:29.400
but then the establishment
hated him.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.090
But the people took readily
to him

14:31.130 --> 14:33.100
because he was a guy
who came to your house.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.100
It didn't mean that,
you know, like other monks,

14:35.130 --> 14:37.100
you had to prepare
a special meal for him.

14:37.130 --> 14:39.620
He probably wanted, you know,
your latest batch of ara,

14:39.650 --> 14:41.280
you know, the local rice wine.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.450
And maybe he'd hit
on your daughter

14:43.480 --> 14:45.450
and your wife as well,
in the process.

14:47.140 --> 14:48.653
So you could imagine
in 16th-century Bhutan,

14:48.660 --> 14:51.110
a person who was known
to have performed miracles

14:51.150 --> 14:52.980
would strike
the fancy of anyone.

14:53.010 --> 14:55.150
- Mm-hmm.
- What were his miracles?

14:55.190 --> 14:56.950
Well, things like
shooting an arrow

14:56.980 --> 14:59.090
all the way from Tibet
and landed in a house

14:59.120 --> 15:01.500
that's about a few
kilometers from here.

15:01.540 --> 15:04.060
- But he did exist, right?
- Yeah.

15:04.090 --> 15:06.090
Then the first thing he did
when he got to the house

15:06.130 --> 15:07.680
where the arrow had landed
was to hit up

15:07.720 --> 15:09.480
on the lady of the house.
Mmhmm.

15:09.510 --> 15:11.410
Yeah, that wouldn't fly
these days.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.240
This is one of
the most difficult things

15:14.270 --> 15:16.100
to understand
about Drukpa Kunley,

15:16.140 --> 15:18.490
because he breaks our own... our...

15:18.520 --> 15:21.250
Our notions about what is right
and what's proper.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.150
This man was essentially saying,

15:23.180 --> 15:24.460
"We should make love."
True.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.080
"We should drink.
We should feel pleasure."

15:27.110 --> 15:29.010
Oh, well, not necessarily that.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.523
I think what he was trying
to say is that,

15:30.530 --> 15:33.050
you know, all these things
that you hold dear

15:33.090 --> 15:34.633
to your heart such as,
you know, your wife

15:34.640 --> 15:37.440
and your kids and your house
and all of this,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.300
in the end,
it doesn't really matter.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.340
So you're saying
the Divine Madman was bringing

15:41.370 --> 15:44.030
people towards enlightenment.
Yes.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.720
So should I be
getting drunk more

15:45.750 --> 15:47.480
and having more casual sex?

15:47.510 --> 15:50.070
Will I be more enlightened?
No, not just because of that.

36:15.810 --> 36:17.780
What's interesting
is the other team

36:17.810 --> 36:19.950
is often standing by the target,

36:19.990 --> 36:22.020
and hanging out looking cool
for as long as possible

36:22.060 --> 36:25.230
as an arrow flies
in your general direction

36:25.270 --> 36:26.610
is standard practice.

36:26.650 --> 36:28.340
Yeah, yeah!

36:28.370 --> 36:30.930
Whoo!

36:34.280 --> 36:37.690
When points are scored,
there's singing and dancing

36:37.730 --> 36:39.630
and a fair amount of
what can only be called

36:39.660 --> 36:40.730
playful taunting.

36:40.770 --> 36:42.390
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

36:43.600 --> 36:46.600
The Bhutanese version
of "In your face!"

36:48.390 --> 36:50.050
Brag dance.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.540
- They're drinking that.
- Yeah.

36:54.570 --> 36:56.610
What could possibly go wrong?

37:05.450 --> 37:06.790
One-in-a-million shot.

37:06.830 --> 37:08.380
Doonk!

37:08.410 --> 37:10.550
I love the little kid over
there with the juice box,

37:10.590 --> 37:13.320
ten feet from the line of fire.

37:13.350 --> 37:14.490
Ah!

37:17.390 --> 37:18.420
Whoa, hey.

37:18.460 --> 37:19.630
Whoa!

37:24.950 --> 37:26.950
What are they screaming?

37:27.780 --> 37:29.300
Why?

37:30.440 --> 37:31.843
- So they're anti-cheerleaders.
- Yes.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.370
What are they saying, though?

37:33.410 --> 37:35.860
Oh, the short guy,
he can't hit, so...

37:35.890 --> 37:37.620
They calling him short?

37:37.650 --> 37:40.450
Yeah. All the bald head
and everything.

The Burning Lake, but I

Ooh.
