00:02.752 --> 00:05.421
So this Naomi has been controlling you...

00:05.588 --> 00:07.590
- ...since she got you out of purgatory?
- Yes.

00:07.798 --> 00:11.177
Wanna guide me out of purgatory
out of the goodness of your undead heart.

00:11.427 --> 00:13.137
- More or less.
- What's in it for you?

00:13.304 --> 00:15.223
- I'm hopping a ride.
- What?

00:15.431 --> 00:18.226
It's a human portal, jackass.

00:18.434 --> 00:20.311
Only humans can pass through.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.146
- He's a vampire.
- The reason I'm topside.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.649
You had to do what you had to do.
But you're out.

00:24.815 --> 00:26.359
And Benny's still breathing. Why?

00:26.567 --> 00:30.363
Listen, Benny, everything you done for me,
I will never forget.

00:30.571 --> 00:32.156
- End of the line?
- End of the line.

00:32.365 --> 00:36.160
God built a series of tests. When you've
done all three, you can slam the gates.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.413
- I didn't pass the test.
- But I did. I'm doing the rest of them.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.582
- Slow down.
- No. You said, nuking hell.

00:41.832 --> 00:44.710
That's how I get out, how I go home.
I need this to be over.

00:47.713 --> 00:49.006
Kevin?

00:49.173 --> 00:50.216
Kevin?

00:51.592 --> 00:53.511
I know what you're up to.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.889
Working with them, those Winchesters?

00:57.098 --> 00:59.100
Dead end, Kevin.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.019
Not here.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.857
Not here either.

01:07.775 --> 01:09.068
Give up?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.070
I'm in your head.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.615
As well as everywhere else.

01:17.910 --> 01:21.497
Last time you irked me, you lost a finger.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.791
Imagine what will happen this time.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.649
Kevin, open up.

01:50.901 --> 01:52.403
Kevin?

01:55.364 --> 01:58.909
Whoa, whoa. Jeez, what's going on?
What's with the SOS?

01:59.952 --> 02:01.078
It's him.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.415
- It's who?
- Crowley.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.292
What about him?

02:06.792 --> 02:08.544
He's in my head.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.213
He's in your head.

02:11.422 --> 02:14.800
- Do you know what that means?
- It means we need to up your anxiety meds.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.260
Kevin, you're dreaming.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.930
If Crowley knew where you were,
he'd do more than mess with your head.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.223
Hey, where's Garth?

02:21.432 --> 02:24.477
On a case. Or the dentist.
I don't know. I haven't heard from him.

02:24.685 --> 02:26.771
What couldn't you say on the phone?

02:26.979 --> 02:29.982
Would you put the frying pan down,
please?

02:33.819 --> 02:36.656
I translated the second trial
from the tablet.

02:38.991 --> 02:42.286
You crazy prophet, you. Nice work.

02:43.704 --> 02:45.498
And if Crowley's in my head, he knows.

02:45.706 --> 02:49.210
- He's not in your head. It's okay.
- He's definitely not in your head, Kevin.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.671
You're stressed.
Just stay with us, all right?

02:51.879 --> 02:53.172
What's the second trial?

02:53.589 --> 02:57.551
An innocent soul has to be rescued
from hell and delivered unto heaven.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.303
- What?
- Unto.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.389
That's how God talks.

03:01.597 --> 03:05.393
Rescue a soul from hell?
Like, actually go to hell.

03:05.601 --> 03:09.855
How do you get a soul unto heaven?
How do you even get a soul out of hell?

03:10.731 --> 03:12.274
We're gonna need an expert.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.246
Winchesters.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.004
- What happened to the hot chicks?
- I'm out of here.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.173
Maybe not.

03:46.308 --> 03:48.519
I ain't got nothing.

03:48.894 --> 03:50.020
Bite me.

03:50.229 --> 03:51.939
Well, then how about another owie?

03:56.026 --> 04:00.364
You know, wouldn't it be a lot easier just
to tell us how to enter hell, uh, uninvited?

04:00.531 --> 04:02.408
It's secret.

04:02.616 --> 04:04.493
We promise we won't tell anyone.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.667
No. Wait. I can't.

04:12.626 --> 04:15.212
It's forbidden, man. They gonna kill me.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.305
Please.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.059
All right, look...

04:29.810 --> 04:33.939
...for a price, y'all can be smuggled
across hell's border.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.358
- By who?
- Rogue reapers.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.821
They got secret ways in and out.

04:41.071 --> 04:42.615
And not just hell.

04:43.073 --> 04:45.159
The veil, heaven.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.328
Rogue reapers smuggling people?

04:47.578 --> 04:48.829
People, souls.

04:49.079 --> 04:51.415
So, what, they're like hell coyotes?

04:54.460 --> 04:57.171
Now kill me. Come on, man.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.090
Better death than Crowley.

05:00.257 --> 05:02.676
Mm-hm. Good point.

05:02.843 --> 05:06.889
But first, you're gonna tell us everything.

05:30.162 --> 05:31.997
Ajay?

05:33.749 --> 05:35.918
Need to talk to you for a sec.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.338
- You know my name?
- And what you do.

05:41.549 --> 05:45.135
- We wanna do business.
- But you are mortal. Flesh and blood.

05:45.302 --> 05:48.138
But if we wanted across the border,
into hell...

05:48.347 --> 05:49.390
Visitor's pass.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.475
No one wants to get into hell.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.853
But could a coyote like you do it?

05:55.145 --> 05:58.691
It's possible. But I have special skills.

05:58.899 --> 06:01.318
I have overhead. It would be pricey.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.362
How pricey?

06:03.571 --> 06:07.241
You two are resourceful.
One day you will owe me a favor.

06:07.449 --> 06:11.579
- You say that like you know us.
- Of course. You're the Winchesters.

06:12.162 --> 06:13.497
Sorry. Have we met?

06:13.706 --> 06:16.375
I am the reaper
who took Bobby Singer to hell.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.171
Bobby in hell?

06:21.338 --> 06:24.008
We burned his bones. Once we did that,
it was over, end of story.

06:24.174 --> 06:27.136
- Hmm, not necessarily.
- No, no, no.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.890
Bobby was on the good side of things,
and good guys go to the penthouse.

06:31.056 --> 06:32.683
Usually. Mostly.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.978
Depends on who you know,
what palms get greased.

06:36.186 --> 06:40.900
If you're on the king of hell's no-fly list,
no way you cruise the friendly skies.

06:42.109 --> 06:43.193
Crowley.

06:45.571 --> 06:49.241
Okay. Let's do this. How much
for two tickets down and three back?

06:49.450 --> 06:50.868
- Dean.
- What?

06:51.869 --> 06:53.370
Come here.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.206
What the hell are you thinking?

06:56.373 --> 06:59.084
You heard the guy. Bobby's in hell.
We're gonna spring him.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.462
We've gone over this.
I have to do the trials.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.131
This is Bobby we're talking about, Sam.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.426
Let's face it, you have not exactly been
up to full speed lately.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.511
We got one shot at this. We can't miss.

07:10.137 --> 07:11.305
I'm not gonna miss.

07:12.514 --> 07:14.224
I'll bring him back.

07:15.434 --> 07:16.769
I'm in. Just me.

07:18.729 --> 07:22.316
- Follow me.
- Wait, wait, wait. How does this work?

07:22.524 --> 07:23.651
Not to fret.

07:23.859 --> 07:27.154
He'll be back in exactly 24 hours' time.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.572
Return for him then.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.772
Take my hand.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.778
And it gets creepier.

08:47.901 --> 08:50.446
- So this is hell?
- Not at all.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.324
This is purgatory.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.086
What do you mean purgatory?
This isn't what I paid for.

09:06.336 --> 09:09.631
- I booked the hell tour.
- Whoa, whoa. Winchester. Detach.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.259
This is hell-adjacent.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.470
Been down this highway
many times before.

09:15.846 --> 09:19.433
Follow the stream
to where three trees meet as one.

09:19.641 --> 09:23.353
Where they meet there are rocks,
between the rocks is the portal.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.732
- The portal?
- A back door to hell.

09:26.940 --> 09:27.983
Trust me, it'll work.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.445
- So you're not coming with me?
- Heh, don't be ridiculous.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.698
Smuggling a mortal across the border
is risky enough.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.535
But gate-crashing a Winchester into hell?
Seriously blows.

09:38.744 --> 09:39.953
No.

09:40.162 --> 09:44.041
I'll be back in 24 hours, precisely.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.169
Be here.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.763
It's a good thing you brought that.

09:57.971 --> 09:59.306
It is not an easy place.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.114
Yo, Kev, it's me.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.953
Kevin.

10:24.623 --> 10:26.458
I believed the closet would be safest.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.919
- Safe from what?
- Crowley.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.465
He's in my head, Dean. And if
he's in my head, he knows where I am.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.802
You know, we should move out,
you know, find another place.

10:37.010 --> 10:38.971
Jeez, Kev, would you chill out, huh?

10:40.347 --> 10:41.974
Have a burger.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.605
Come on. Don't lose it on me now, dude.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.567
There you go. That's it.

10:53.735 --> 10:55.654
Just tell me when this all ends.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.157
Because that's the only thing
I wanna hear.

10:59.283 --> 11:03.245
No, like I told you before,
this isn't going to end.

11:05.998 --> 11:10.169
Look, man, other guys,
they got it easy, you know?

11:10.377 --> 11:14.381
It's all backyard barbecues
and bowling teams.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.384
But you and me,
we gotta carry a little extra weight.

11:18.385 --> 11:20.053
I can't take it.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.392
Yes, you can.

11:26.476 --> 11:28.478
Hey, look at me.

11:29.354 --> 11:31.607
This whole thing sucks. I know.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.984
But you suck it up.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.904
And you push through
because that's what we do.

11:38.488 --> 11:41.533
And when you get on board with that,
the ride is a lot smoother.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.204
French fry?

11:52.794 --> 11:54.171
I'm gonna be in my room.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.632
Let me know when there's a good day.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.842
That's my pie.

12:17.402 --> 12:19.529
Hello, Ajay.

12:22.950 --> 12:27.079
It's been a while since we chatted.
Too long.

12:28.455 --> 12:30.874
Pizza? Extra anchovies.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.878
Anything you want to get off your chest?
An update?

12:35.045 --> 12:38.924
Um, no. No, not really.

12:39.132 --> 12:42.594
As you may recall,
patience isn't one of my virtues.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.554
Well, I don't have any virtues.

12:44.721 --> 12:47.641
But if I did, I'm certain
that patience wouldn't be one.

12:47.849 --> 12:52.354
So sure there's nothing weighing on you?

12:57.067 --> 13:01.071
Nothing, say, about making a deal
with the Winchesters?

13:01.238 --> 13:04.241
Sir, I know better than to attempt that.

13:05.075 --> 13:09.079
My operative saw you leaving
with Sam Winchester.

13:10.038 --> 13:12.916
Oh. Oh, Sam Winchester.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.254
Oh, yes. That's a possibility.

13:17.462 --> 13:19.131
You're trying my non-patience.

13:19.339 --> 13:22.092
Sir, I was just doing what I do.

13:22.301 --> 13:27.764
As you are more than aware, I do
occasionally moonlight as a freelancer.

13:28.765 --> 13:33.020
You do not freelance with them.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.315
What did Sam want?

13:37.024 --> 13:40.527
Well, uh, actually,
it's, uh, starting to come back.

13:41.653 --> 13:45.490
- He may have wanted to get into hell.
- My hell? Why would he wanna do that?

13:45.699 --> 13:49.661
I don't know. I swear.
My job, I don't ask questions.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.791
And what time is Mr. Winchester due back
from hell?

13:54.958 --> 13:57.544
Uh, I'm picking him up in...

13:57.919 --> 13:59.838
Well, now 17 hours.

14:00.047 --> 14:03.008
I see. Anything else?

14:03.925 --> 14:05.344
No.

14:05.927 --> 14:07.471
I swear.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.474
Hmm.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.153
That's one fare you won't be collecting.

15:51.616 --> 15:52.993
It's a rabbit hole.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.995
This is nuts.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.234
I'm innocent.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.569
Help me.

17:11.988 --> 17:14.824
Eddie? Eddie? Eddie.

17:14.991 --> 17:16.492
Eddie.

17:17.827 --> 17:20.329
You came. I knew you would.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.165
I've been praying for forever.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.044
I'm not him. I'm sorry.

17:26.502 --> 17:29.047
You came. I knew you would.

17:29.589 --> 17:32.842
I've been praying for forever.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.227
You came. I knew you would.

17:42.894 --> 17:45.897
I've been praying for forever.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.707
Bobby?

18:19.764 --> 18:22.767
Get the hell out of here,
you black-eyed son of a bitch.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.104
- What? Bobby, it's Sam.
- Yeah, and I'm Elvis.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.439
- Move your ass.
- Bobby.

18:27.647 --> 18:29.399
- Get!
- It's me.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.109
Okay, damn it.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.988
If it's not Sam, then how do I know
about you and Tori Spelling?

18:35.405 --> 18:37.115
- What?
- You're a fan.

18:37.532 --> 18:39.326
Yeah. Or, uh...

18:39.534 --> 18:42.245
Okay, what about your free pedicure
at the Mall of America?

18:42.579 --> 18:46.583
You made Dean swear to never tell another
living soul how it changed your life.

18:48.918 --> 18:50.003
Sam?

18:57.594 --> 19:03.767
I'm sorry, Sam,
but you're the 200th Sam I've seen today.

19:03.975 --> 19:05.560
That's how they screw with me.

19:05.769 --> 19:10.649
Just endless Sams and Deans,
all wearing the same black eyes.

19:10.940 --> 19:13.443
Wait a minute.
What the hell are you doing here?

19:14.819 --> 19:16.946
Please don't tell me
it's what I think it is.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.533
No, no. No, Bobby, I'm good. I...

19:22.077 --> 19:23.828
I'm here to get you.

19:24.996 --> 19:26.831
You don't belong here, Bobby.

19:28.249 --> 19:29.959
And we're getting you out.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.005
Am I the only one who sees
the urgency of this?

19:34.214 --> 19:37.467
- Sir.
- Something is going on.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.969
My hellhound has been killed.

19:40.178 --> 19:43.807
Winchester, jumbo size,
is trying to break into the mother ship...

19:44.015 --> 19:46.851
...and that prophet of theirs
is madly translating away.

19:47.060 --> 19:50.105
- Add it up.
- I will, sir.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.150
Where did we get you?

19:54.567 --> 19:56.486
A temp agency?

20:00.824 --> 20:04.703
I need Kevin Tran
and I need his half of the tablet.

20:04.911 --> 20:07.372
Apparently, his half has the good stuff...

20:07.580 --> 20:11.000
...where mine has the acknowledgments
and "about the author."

20:11.167 --> 20:13.253
- It will be done.
- It had better be.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.589
Find that kid.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.888
Hey, Kevin. Come in here
and grab some of these eggs.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.059
Kev, come on, man,
you can't hide in there forever.

20:32.522 --> 20:35.233
Where the hell have you been?
What happened to being scared?

20:36.025 --> 20:39.195
I am scared.
So I made a preemptive move.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.284
You made a what now?

20:44.576 --> 20:48.371
I can't sit here with the tablet
like a sitting duck...

20:48.580 --> 20:51.040
...and Crowley breathing down my ass.

20:51.249 --> 20:54.085
Getting rid of the tablet
just takes off some of the pressure.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.255
- Wait. Getting rid of it?
- Temporarily. I hid it.

20:57.922 --> 20:59.090
What? Where?

20:59.716 --> 21:02.844
If I tell you where,
it's not hidden, is it?

21:03.052 --> 21:06.181
Kevin, tell me where the damn tablet is
or I swear to you...

21:06.389 --> 21:07.557
You'll what, Dean?

21:09.893 --> 21:11.478
Kevin!

21:16.149 --> 21:18.610
Kids. So cute when they're little...

21:18.818 --> 21:22.113
...then they turn into teenagers
and the party's over.

21:22.363 --> 21:25.116
We haven't been formally introduced,
Dean.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.493
My name is Naomi.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.330
Oh, I know who you are.

21:31.289 --> 21:34.125
And I know what you did to Cass
after he got out of purgatory.

21:34.334 --> 21:37.128
After I rescued him from purgatory,
you mean?

21:37.587 --> 21:39.964
At the cost of many angels' lives.

21:40.173 --> 21:43.927
You screwed with his head
and had him spy on us.

21:44.135 --> 21:48.223
Well, it is true that I have spoken
with Castiel many times.

21:48.431 --> 21:50.600
Trying to reach out to him,
trying to help him.

21:51.226 --> 21:55.522
Dean, you must have noticed
how purgatory changed him.

21:55.730 --> 21:58.316
I mean, he's been unstable in the past...

21:58.525 --> 22:01.528
...but I was shocked
at how damaged he is now.

22:01.736 --> 22:05.073
Stop, okay? Don't try to spin this.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.617
You think I don't know
you told him to try and kill me?

22:09.619 --> 22:11.788
Yeah, I suppose
that is how he would hear it.

22:12.997 --> 22:18.753
When I learned of the angel tablet,
I did tell Castiel to get it at any cost.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.046
That's my job...

22:20.880 --> 22:22.715
...to protect heaven.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.803
I'm a warrior just as you are.
What would you expect?

22:27.345 --> 22:33.309
And now Castiel is in the wind
with a hydrogen bomb in his pocket and I...

22:33.810 --> 22:36.229
I'm scared for all of us.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.898
Save it.

22:39.148 --> 22:43.194
See, I don't trust angels,
which means I don't trust you.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.697
And yet you haven't warded this place
against us.

22:47.156 --> 22:48.658
I know.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.035
You're hoping Castiel will return to you.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.831
I admire your loyalty.
I only wish he felt the same way.

22:56.499 --> 23:01.170
I know you don't wanna believe it, Dean,
but we're on the same side.

23:01.379 --> 23:05.758
Shutting the gates of hell,
bringing Castiel in from the cold.

23:08.052 --> 23:11.931
Take a moment.
Think about what I've said.

23:12.098 --> 23:15.727
Oh, I know you've been doing business
with Ajay.

23:15.935 --> 23:18.229
He did mention, didn't he...

23:18.438 --> 23:21.024
...that his way into hell
is through purgatory?

23:23.276 --> 23:25.528
I knew you'd wanna know.

23:25.737 --> 23:29.616
You see, we can be of help to each other.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.999
- You know where the hell you're going?
- Yeah, we're almost there.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.502
Get back. Get back, get back.

23:52.805 --> 23:54.223
We gotta get out of here.

23:54.390 --> 23:57.310
- They're messing with you.
- Don't listen to him. He's not real.

23:57.518 --> 23:59.979
- Bobby, get away from him.
- We gotta go now.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.567
You knew somehow, right?

24:05.318 --> 24:06.361
I took a chance.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.031
Fifty-fifty.

24:14.869 --> 24:16.829
What do we do now?

24:26.673 --> 24:29.509
Ajay? Hey.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.818
What the hell is this?

24:49.195 --> 24:51.614
All right, well, don't get all pissed off.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.784
Purgatory.

24:55.618 --> 24:56.786
Balls.

24:57.578 --> 24:59.122
Let's go.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.919
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.923
Know. I know, man.
It's been a long time.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.260
I mean, I wanted
to call, I did. I just, uh...

25:12.427 --> 25:14.303
I thought it might be better if I didn't.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.098
So good to hear your voice, Dean.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.225
I mean that.

25:20.476 --> 25:23.396
- How you been?
- Well, you know...

25:24.188 --> 25:26.024
...I get by.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.943
I guess I let you down, huh?

25:30.319 --> 25:32.697
I'm just happy as hell to hear from you.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.992
You might change your mind about that.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.535
Why? What you mean?

25:38.995 --> 25:41.330
Benny, I gotta ask you a favor.

25:42.123 --> 25:44.125
It's a big one.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.045
So how many more of these trials
after this?

25:47.253 --> 25:51.549
Just one. I don't know what it is, though.
Not yet. Kevin's still translating.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.886
Well, you saw back there in hell,
I ain't got a lot of rust.

25:56.095 --> 25:59.140
Just feels so good
to be back in action again.

25:59.348 --> 26:01.559
Might be handy
you having me around to help.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.146
Bobby, I'd love that. Believe me.

26:06.064 --> 26:11.194
The thing is, for this trial to be
completed, your soul has to enter heaven.

26:12.779 --> 26:16.407
And besides, if that weren't the case,
we burned your bones, Bobby.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.785
There's nothing to tie
your spirit to Earth.

26:19.535 --> 26:22.705
Yeah. Yeah, well...

26:22.914 --> 26:25.875
You know, I always figured
that'd be the end of it.

26:26.084 --> 26:30.463
You know, just a hunter's funeral.
Then, zip, nothing.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.590
And I was okay with that.

26:33.299 --> 26:35.176
Imagine my surprise.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.264
I guess if there has to be an eternity,
I'd pick heaven over hell.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.975
Yeah, because there's nothing screwy
going on up there.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.437
I wish I made the rules.

26:48.397 --> 26:55.029
I'll, uh, do my part, get to the end of this,
but I ain't exactly the retiring type...

26:55.238 --> 26:59.450
...so if you idjits figure out a way
to spring me...

26:59.659 --> 27:02.328
Yeah. No, of course. That's, uh... Yeah.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.914
Well, then let's get topside.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.210
What's going on, Sam?

27:09.627 --> 27:12.004
This is it. This is the place.
I'm sure of it.

27:14.966 --> 27:19.137
- Where your cabbie's supposed to meet you?
- Yeah. At exactly now.

27:19.345 --> 27:20.721
So he's running a little late.

27:20.930 --> 27:24.100
See, that's the thing.
He was very specific, Bobby. To the minute.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.519
And if he doesn't show?

27:27.436 --> 27:29.188
We got no way out.

27:35.069 --> 27:38.364
If you want nothing to do with this,
I completely understand.

27:39.740 --> 27:44.579
Wow, when Dean Winchester asks
for a favor, he's not screwing around, heh.

27:44.787 --> 27:47.290
Sending you back there
is the last thing I ever wanted to do.

27:47.498 --> 27:50.960
- I know, I know.
- But my little brother is stuck down there.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.296
This would be the brother
who wants to kill me?

27:53.504 --> 27:55.006
You got access to the place.

27:55.214 --> 27:58.009
By "access" you mean getting beheaded?

28:00.219 --> 28:02.471
Yeah, you're right. It's too much.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.349
It's not like I've exactly
been there for you lately.

28:05.558 --> 28:07.059
What?

28:07.268 --> 28:09.312
Oh, come on, Dean.

28:10.479 --> 28:13.065
You know I love a challenge, heh.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.985
You're serious?

28:16.819 --> 28:19.488
Hey, he's your brother.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.075
I say let's do this.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.703
I owe you.

28:26.078 --> 28:27.997
You don't owe me nothing.

28:29.999 --> 28:33.044
Truth is, uh,
I could use a break from all this.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.297
Has it really been that tough?

28:37.381 --> 28:39.258
I'm not a good fit, Dean.

28:40.676 --> 28:44.055
Not with the vampires,
and for sure not with the humans.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.433
I don't belong.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.811
And after a while...

28:51.270 --> 28:53.147
...that starts to wear on you.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.236
Right. Heh.

28:58.527 --> 29:01.948
Cry me a river.
Like you need to listen to this, heh.

29:03.741 --> 29:07.745
Well, when you get back up here,
we're gonna fix all that, okay?

29:09.455 --> 29:12.792
- When I get back?
- Yeah. You find the portal...

29:13.167 --> 29:17.338
...and you ride out of purgatory with Sam,
just like you did with me, okay?

29:20.341 --> 29:22.760
Soon as I send you back,
I'm gonna haul my ass up to Maine.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.680
I'm gonna be waiting there for you
when you get topside.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.558
Yeah, that sounds like a plan, chief.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.312
Let's get on with it.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.690
You sure about this?

29:36.315 --> 29:38.609
Not my first rodeo, man.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.804
Thank you.

30:16.605 --> 30:18.649
Ugh, come on, you wimp.

30:31.370 --> 30:33.456
Dean spent a year in this place?

30:33.664 --> 30:35.916
Running and fighting. All day, every day.

30:36.125 --> 30:39.837
Must have been hell on you, not being
able to get him out all that time.

30:42.256 --> 30:44.216
You did try?

30:44.425 --> 30:46.260
Bobby, Dean and I had an agreement,
okay?

30:46.469 --> 30:48.262
I know that agreement.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.431
I taught you that agreement.

30:50.639 --> 30:52.350
That's a non-agreement.

30:53.726 --> 30:56.979
I get the feeling a lot must have happened
while I was gone.

30:59.315 --> 31:00.941
Sam.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.372
Bobby, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

31:18.959 --> 31:20.002
Why are you here?

31:22.046 --> 31:23.297
Dean sent me.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.549
Dean? Not my Dean.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.426
He's a buddy of Dean's, Bobby.

31:27.885 --> 31:30.429
- A buddy?
- A good buddy.

31:30.971 --> 31:32.556
A frigging vampire?

31:35.810 --> 31:39.897
Well, you two really went off the rails
while I was gone, didn't you?

32:11.554 --> 32:14.723
You saved my brother's ass a few times
down here and I respect that.

32:14.932 --> 32:17.268
And now I'm trying to save yours, heh.

32:17.476 --> 32:19.603
You know,
I'm a disgrace to my own people.

32:22.731 --> 32:24.400
Yeah, this is the spot.

32:24.608 --> 32:27.319
- The seam that gets us back up top?
- Mm-hm.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.281
Is that it?

32:31.740 --> 32:33.242
Yeah, that's it.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.744
You boys remember what I told you?

32:36.495 --> 32:39.832
Yeah. All right, Bobby, here it goes.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.294
We get to Earth, I release you,
it's an express straight to heaven.

32:43.502 --> 32:44.545
No time for goodbyes.

32:45.045 --> 32:48.257
I already said goodbye to you once, Sam.
Didn't seem to take.

32:49.258 --> 32:52.428
No reason to think I won't see you again,
somewhere down the road.

32:53.387 --> 32:54.597
Yeah.

32:54.805 --> 32:59.393
But if they give me a rocking
chair up there, I'm raising hell.

33:20.956 --> 33:24.084
All right. Come on, Benny, it's your turn.

33:27.796 --> 33:30.049
- Hurry up.
- Benny.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.968
And still working with the Winchesters.

33:33.844 --> 33:36.305
- Hurry.
- Time for you to go, Sam.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.058
Benny?

33:39.308 --> 33:42.394
Go on. It's me they want.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.147
Go on. And just make sure you tell Dean
I said goodbye.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.151
I was never any good up there, anyway.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.861
Benny, wait.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.880
Benny?

34:54.382 --> 34:57.511
Purgatory, right?
A real garden spot, ain't it?

34:58.137 --> 34:59.597
Yeah, heh.

35:00.389 --> 35:01.807
Did you get them out?

35:03.309 --> 35:05.894
- Only Bobby.
- What?

35:07.104 --> 35:08.939
I mean, that's fantastic about Bobby.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.649
Dean, look, Benny, uh...

35:12.568 --> 35:13.777
...he got us out.

35:13.986 --> 35:17.406
A bunch of vamps showed
and he used himself as bait.

35:21.410 --> 35:25.122
I get the feeling that even if that
didn't happen, he didn't wanna come back.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.418
I'm sorry.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.797
You're probably right.

35:37.843 --> 35:41.597
So, uh, Bobby,
how'd he hold up down there?

35:42.598 --> 35:45.142
He's good, all things considered.

35:45.351 --> 35:48.103
- And ornery as hell, of course.
- As he should be.

35:50.272 --> 35:52.191
Let's put that old man where he belongs.

35:53.859 --> 35:54.943
Yeah.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.764
- The hell?
- Hello, boys.

36:25.182 --> 36:28.060
Bobby Singer. I'd know you anywhere.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.606
Let him go, Crowley.
He doesn't belong in hell.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.858
He does if I say he does.

36:35.067 --> 36:37.820
He's inflicted untold damage on my kind.

36:38.028 --> 36:41.115
From where I sit,
actually, hell's too good for him.

36:41.865 --> 36:43.242
Really?

36:54.086 --> 36:55.546
What?

36:56.922 --> 36:58.340
Oh, come on.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.927
Let me see if I've interpreted
the situation correctly.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.013
The Winchesters have freed
an innocent from hell...

37:05.222 --> 37:08.308
...to which you are wrongfully trying
to return it.

37:08.517 --> 37:10.936
Siding with them, Naomi?
You don't know those two.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.439
Before they're done,
we'll both be locked away.

37:13.647 --> 37:17.109
I'm just hoping they lock you away, dear.
The rest, I'll figure out.

37:17.317 --> 37:18.736
Bureaucrat.

37:18.944 --> 37:21.071
You're fighting outside your weight class.

37:21.447 --> 37:24.032
Don't call me a bureaucrat.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.690
I told you you could trust me.

38:01.069 --> 38:04.406
- What the hell was that about?
- I'll tell you later.

38:04.615 --> 38:05.908
Let's get this trial done.

38:18.003 --> 38:19.421
Sam?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.632
What? What?

38:21.840 --> 38:24.176
- Talk to me. What?
- It's okay. It's okay.

38:30.808 --> 38:33.101
It's okay, I'm fine.

38:33.268 --> 38:34.520
It's done.

38:35.979 --> 38:37.606
It's done.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.795
So tired of this, aren't you, Kevin?

39:01.171 --> 39:03.048
The fear, the hiding.

39:03.257 --> 39:05.133
I know I am.

39:09.304 --> 39:10.931
It's a dream.

39:11.139 --> 39:13.016
It's just a dream.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.661
Kevin Tran.

39:32.828 --> 39:34.872
It's been a while.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.416
Thought you could elude me forever?

39:38.166 --> 39:39.376
There's always a way.

39:39.585 --> 39:43.213
If you can't find one Tran, find another.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.800
Your mom,
she didn't wanna give you up.

39:47.217 --> 39:48.927
Quite a pain threshold, that one.

39:49.177 --> 39:51.722
But even she could only take so much.

39:51.930 --> 39:53.891
She never would have told you.

39:54.099 --> 39:56.184
Moms are like that, aren't they?

39:57.686 --> 40:00.397
So we killed her
and got your address off her smartphone.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.441
No!

40:02.691 --> 40:09.531
What you people never seem to understand
is that you are nothing.

40:09.740 --> 40:13.118
Fleeting blips of light.

40:14.328 --> 40:18.540
I am forever.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.258
You okay?

40:28.884 --> 40:30.469
Yeah, I'll live.

40:39.728 --> 40:40.771
I buried Benny.

40:42.439 --> 40:44.358
But I didn't burn his bones.

40:45.400 --> 40:49.154
After he said he'd try to get you
out of there, it just didn't seem right.

40:49.738 --> 40:54.242
- I know you got no use for him, but...
- No, no, no, you know what? I get it.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.411
I do. He's, uh...

40:57.454 --> 40:59.748
He's a little different
from what I thought.

41:00.874 --> 41:03.877
So go ahead and leave the door open,
if you want.

41:08.590 --> 41:12.219
Let's go check in with prophet boy
and see where he stashed that tablet.

41:14.096 --> 41:16.848
Kevin? It's us.

41:20.268 --> 41:21.770
Kevin.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.067
Kevin?

41:35.492 --> 41:37.119
He's gone.

41:37.536 --> 41:39.579
He took all his stuff. His notes.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.623
I saw this coming.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.709
Finally freaked.

41:44.292 --> 41:46.545
The little geek made a run for it.

41:47.921 --> 41:49.881
Yeah, but where?
