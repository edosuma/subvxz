00:01.242 --> 00:03.418
<i>Previously
on "Berlin Station"...</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:09.633
Nina.

00:09.677 --> 00:10.968
You know that guy?

00:11.012 --> 00:13.595
No.
Maybe he knows my dad.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.181
- How hard is it to operate?
- It's not like using a gun.

00:16.225 --> 00:19.184
It has to be focused precisely
by someone who is trained.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.936
Let's put it to a vote.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.480
Whether or not we will advocate
for invoking Article 5.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.940
I gave you my support,

00:24.984 --> 00:27.170
and then B.B. Yates
blindsides all of us.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.754
And you didn't even
see it coming, Valerie.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.639
I know you broke into
Vassily's safe, Mr. DiSanto.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.872
What I want to know is why.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.227
Hector and I
are being hunted.
We're gonna get you
out of there.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.168
We are very close
on kompromat from Krik

00:44.211 --> 00:45.711
that is gonna bring him down.

00:45.755 --> 00:47.482
You get rid of him,
you still have Platov.

00:47.506 --> 00:48.900
From what I've seen, he's worse.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.277
Put the gun down.
Let me take you home.

00:50.301 --> 00:53.135
You're Diver.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.219
I'm sure of it.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.060
<i>Frau Krug.</i>

04:45.411 --> 04:47.619
<i>Vassily Krik,
a St. Petersburg's...</i>

04:47.663 --> 04:50.706
Dominos are falling.
Krik is done.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.292
We still haven't heard
anything yet?

04:53.335 --> 04:55.605
No. Getting more information
from the ANN

04:55.629 --> 04:57.232
than we are from our own
fucking operatives.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.923
No, no, listen,
if Steven's gone radio silent,

04:59.967 --> 05:02.009
we just have to trust
that he's getting it done.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.116
It's been a day and a half.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.118
Don't second-guess your decision
sending him in.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.703
He was in the right place
at the right time.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.184
He knows Komarovo.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.540
He's in the private sector.
He's gone soft.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.314
But he gets shit done.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.710
And with Hector helping him...

05:16.734 --> 05:18.859
Yeah, exactly.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.237
We still haven't heard anything
from Daniel or Torres.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.490
Krik's arrest means nothing
if Daniel's right

05:25.534 --> 05:26.845
and Platov has taken the reins.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.493
Of course he's taking over.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.330
He's kicking it into high gear
with this blackout in Estonia.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.962
Yes.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.641
Are you sure?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.564
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

05:57.608 --> 05:59.149
What?

05:59.193 --> 06:01.902
Who was that?

06:04.573 --> 06:06.823
It was the German police.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.472
They found a body
in an alleyway.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.896
It's a positive ID...
It's Daniel.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.800
What do you know for sure?

07:06.844 --> 07:09.845
An anonymous caller reported
a shooting earlier today,

07:09.888 --> 07:10.971
but that's bullshit.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.056
Yes, he's been shot,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.643
but also beaten, burned.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.813
Body temperature indicates
he's been dead longer than this.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.607
18 to 20 hours.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.212
When I spoke to him
night before last,

07:24.236 --> 07:26.653
he was, um... he was on the run.

07:26.697 --> 07:30.699
He was wounded,
but he was fighting.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.244
Hector and Torres
were in Komarovo.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.912
Were there any other bodies?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.498
Not that we're aware of, no.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.877
I-I should call his father,
shouldn't I?

07:41.920 --> 07:45.714
I mean, it's not
how I was hoping to meet him.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.861
Esther,
it's actually CIA protocol

07:47.885 --> 07:49.612
that I contact the next of kin.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.219
Yeah, yeah.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.431
But I think you should call him.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.516
Thank you.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.727
Then I'll contact him
when we've made arrangements.

07:58.770 --> 07:59.978
Yeah.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.195
Robert.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.155
This isn't right.

08:10.199 --> 08:13.867
He was on his way
to the fucking exfil.

08:13.911 --> 08:17.412
Don't. I was the one
who sent him in.

08:17.456 --> 08:21.124
But I left him there.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.543
He was doing his job.
We all were.

08:23.587 --> 08:27.881
Tell me everything he said to
you when you last spoke to him.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.010
We're gonna make someone
very sorry.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.654
Hmm?

09:41.790 --> 09:44.541
You can't duck me forever, Dove.
Promises were made.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.168
I'm done waiting.
Time's up.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.838
I did 18 months hard time
in Kirikiri

09:49.881 --> 09:51.693
so you and your father
could fly the coop.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.717
Karma is on my side, you fucker.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.948
You hungry?

10:19.077 --> 10:20.452
Starving.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.710
You came here to steal
from Vassily Krik.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.879
Saw an easy mark.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.714
A pompous man with...

10:32.758 --> 10:36.551
rubles spilling
from his pockets.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.970
Pretty much.

10:39.014 --> 10:42.891
I'm not a fan of the easy kill.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.810
I see a man,

10:45.854 --> 10:48.980
and I think...

10:49.024 --> 10:51.441
"Someone worked hard to grow
this plant."

10:51.485 --> 10:53.838
You know,
somebody took baby photos,

10:53.862 --> 10:55.423
gave him lessons
to do something.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.490
"Play violin, beat the other kids
with a cricket bat."

11:01.620 --> 11:03.578
So you and Blake,

11:03.622 --> 11:06.122
disaster capitalism,

11:06.166 --> 11:08.061
45% return
on a $50 million outlay.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.188
That was all lies
to get Krik's passwords?

11:10.212 --> 11:11.753
Oh, no, no, no.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.129
It was all real,

11:13.173 --> 11:17.467
but those deals will take weeks.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.261
You need the money for Estonia
now, right?

11:20.305 --> 11:22.597
Blake talks too much.

11:23.975 --> 11:27.102
Krik had plenty of time
and money to plan.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.978
Why is this
all falling on you now?

11:29.022 --> 11:32.607
Like most men
who've always been rich,

11:32.651 --> 11:35.485
Krik just kept postponing
paying the bills until later.

11:35.529 --> 11:39.447
Hmm. So you inherit
the fucking debt?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.908
Yes.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.512
I need $400 million
by midnight tomorrow.

11:50.836 --> 11:55.171
Blake kept going on and on about
Krik's art at the freeport.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.966
Said it was worth
at least half a billion.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.052
I got a buddy of mine at the
center of the Berlin art world.

12:01.096 --> 12:04.639
He's got all the big collectors
on speed dial.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.892
Helmut could liquidate it fast.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.123
And these big collectors
aren't going to have questions

12:10.147 --> 12:13.273
about sanctions
and legitimacy and so on?

12:13.316 --> 12:14.794
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

12:14.818 --> 12:18.945
These guys,
they love shady deals.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.698
That's the only way
that they can get their
hands on a masterpiece.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.825
But you gotta move now.

12:23.869 --> 12:26.453
The Kremlin's probably gonna
seize all of Krik's assets

12:26.496 --> 12:27.954
within the next 48 hours.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.665
What's his cut?
Standard 10%.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.917
I can be in Berlin
within the next two hours.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.148
And why do you need
to be there in person?

12:35.172 --> 12:37.589
Come on, man.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.049
When it's
half a billion dollars,

12:40.093 --> 12:43.720
this man needs a handshake
and a face.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.103
Fine.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.397
I'll go with you.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.793
He doesn't like new people.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.276
He'll like me.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.654
Let's jet.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.791
Estonia is dark.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.001
Comms, power, Wi-Fi...
Everything is down.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.629
Flights into Tallinn
had to be diverted to Helsinki.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.798
According to CNN,
the grid overloaded.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.300
That's pretty common with these
old Soviet Bloc countries.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.697
No, General Lancer says
the satellite imagery is static.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.681
That indicates
deliberate jamming.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.390
Why were you talking
to General Lancer?

13:29.434 --> 13:32.811
That's NSC business, Jason.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.854
Vassily Krik is in custody.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.231
Estonia is settling.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.419
NATO's reputation is preserved.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.421
Everyone here is very pleased
with your work.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.612
Well, that's always nice
to hear. Thank you.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.092
In fact, they'd be comfortable
nominating you

13:45.116 --> 13:46.866
for CIA directorship.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.954
So next time I'll be the one
sending you around the world.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.142
I told you I sent you there
to notch up a win,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.645
and that's exactly
what you did,<i> boss.</i>

13:55.669 --> 13:59.003
Stop worrying so much.
Take care.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.339
Goodbye, Jason.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.429
Bankole Inyang is dead.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.516
According to the coroner,
a healthy 28-year-old man

14:11.560 --> 14:13.955
had a sudden,
catastrophic aortic rupture.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.290
Somebody used Adeyemi's weapon
on him.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.792
There were specs
of the technology

14:17.816 --> 14:19.126
stuffed into his jacket pocket,

14:19.150 --> 14:21.379
but no sign
of the weapon itself.

14:21.403 --> 14:26.239
I think Bankole was
a test subject <i> and</i> the fall guy,

14:26.283 --> 14:28.636
which confirms our biggest fear.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.555
With the right medical training,

14:30.579 --> 14:33.872
an assassin can use this to kill
someone on a crowded street

14:33.915 --> 14:36.291
and just walk away.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.544
Makes you want to rethink
public transportation.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.718
What's wrong?

14:46.761 --> 14:49.095
Daniel is dead.

14:49.139 --> 14:52.307
His body was found here
in Berlin this morning.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.560
Makes no sense.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.604
Makes no sense at all.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.084
He was with Hector
night before last.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.359
I guess they never made it
to the exfil point.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.112
I thought Steven Frost
was going to get him.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.781
He must not have reached him
in time.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.909
And what about Torres?

15:10.952 --> 15:13.786
No word from anyone.

15:13.830 --> 15:17.081
We think Platov killed him and
dumped his body here in Berlin

15:17.125 --> 15:20.001
so there'd be
no association with Russia.

15:20.045 --> 15:24.213
But forensics
has to find traces.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.776
He was there for one week.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.093
Daniel's body is clean
on a microscopic level.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.597
No stray fibers, hairs,
or skin cells anywhere on him.

15:33.808 --> 15:34.849
I have Wolfe on the line.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.643
Jesus.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.023
<i>Valerie, what the fuck?
Do you have confirmation?</i>

15:42.067 --> 15:43.544
<i>Is Daniel Miller really dead?</i>

15:43.568 --> 15:44.943
Yes, it's been confirmed.

15:44.986 --> 15:48.029
<i>Jesus!
And he was MIA.</i>

15:48.073 --> 15:50.301
<i>Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about it?</i>

15:50.325 --> 15:52.450
<i>Kirsch, you were the last one
to see him.</i>

15:52.494 --> 15:54.410
<i>Why did you break protocol?</i>
Jason,

15:54.454 --> 15:57.538
we just lost one of our men.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.893
We'll have time to figure out

15:58.917 --> 16:00.625
how that happened
at a later point.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.044
But right now, Estonia
is coming to a head, and...

16:03.088 --> 16:07.090
<i>Estonia is done.</i>
Jesus Fucking Christ,
Wolfe, no, it's fucking not!

16:07.133 --> 16:10.259
This blackout is the fucking
endgame, same as Ukraine.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.970
Platov took over for Krik.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.075
His troops will install
a puppet government,

16:14.099 --> 16:16.849
raise the Russian flag,
and mow down any resistance

16:16.893 --> 16:19.644
before it can be caught
on some asshole's smartphone.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.582
And when the lights come up,

16:21.606 --> 16:24.232
Estonia will just be that
stretch of Russia

16:24.275 --> 16:26.629
connecting Kaliningrad
and St. Petersburg.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.611
It's a move right out of
the Crimean playbook.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.530
They put down any
and all resistance,

16:30.573 --> 16:32.782
and they can make up
whatever story they want.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.804
<i>Well, maybe that story
will keep us all out</i>

16:34.828 --> 16:37.120
<i>of World War III.</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:40.081
But fuck Estonia, huh?

16:40.125 --> 16:43.167
And when their Little Green Men
worm their way into Latvia

16:43.211 --> 16:45.461
and it starts looking like
a civil war there, then what?

16:45.505 --> 16:48.464
No.
I want to know.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.842
When do we take a stand?

16:50.885 --> 16:53.970
When do the promises of
the United States of America

16:54.014 --> 16:56.305
mean a God damn thing?

17:00.437 --> 17:03.146
<i>I understand
you're all upset about Miller,</i>

17:03.189 --> 17:04.896
<i>but my orders are clear.</i>

17:04.941 --> 17:08.734
<i>Stand down on Estonia.</i>

17:08.778 --> 17:11.029
I've made arrangements
for Daniel's body

17:11.071 --> 17:13.448
to be transferred to Andrews.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.450
<i>There'll be an inquiry.</i>

17:15.492 --> 17:17.762
<i>Robert, since you were
the last one to see him alive,</i>

17:17.787 --> 17:19.515
<i>there'll be a lot of questions
to answer.</i>

17:19.539 --> 17:22.018
That's fine. Of course.
I'll do whatever I can to help.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.020
<i>Until then,
I think you should go home.</i>

17:24.044 --> 17:25.626
<i>Take some time.</i>

17:25.670 --> 17:27.587
Are you firing me?

17:27.630 --> 17:30.339
<i>You're on leave, pending
the results of the inquiry.</i>

17:42.062 --> 17:44.228
You're gonna need help, Valerie.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.898
With Frost, Torres,
and DeJean MIA,

17:46.941 --> 17:48.733
your bullpen's
looking pretty bare.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.861
I can finish this without
B.B. Yates, thank you very much.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.571
You can finish it faster
with her.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.281
Look, I know. I know.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.950
She lied to you.
She fucked us over.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.620
You can't trust her.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.017
What she did was unconscionable.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.602
I will not get burned again.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.502
She thought she was doing
the right thing at the time.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.545
At least talk to her.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.214
You just got shut down there.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.800
She still has pull.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.137
Go home, Robert.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.818
I'm so sorry about Daniel.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.195
It doesn't seem real.

18:34.239 --> 18:38.032
I felt the same way
when Paavo was murdered.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.828
He was right here walking
by my side, giving me shit.

18:41.871 --> 18:45.373
And then just gone.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.959
And now I can't reach Jan.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.231
What did Jan say exactly
when you spoke to him?

18:50.255 --> 18:53.089
We were talking on the phone.
I heard screams.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.341
Jan told me something
was happening,

18:55.385 --> 18:57.301
and then we were disconnected.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.429
From what I can tell,
Estonia is blacked out,

19:00.473 --> 19:02.181
but Tervik still has power.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.869
That doesn't make any sense.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.686
Thanks.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.229
Actually, it might.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.292
Jan told me
someone was trying to gain

19:10.316 --> 19:12.169
unauthorized access
to our network.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.380
I think the Russians
hacked Tervik,

19:14.404 --> 19:18.281
and now they're using my server
to power this blackout.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.177
They've done it before
in Ukraine.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.701
Could you shut the server down?

19:24.956 --> 19:27.081
Theoretically, yes.

19:27.125 --> 19:31.961
I have a master code
to override any outside hack.

19:32.005 --> 19:36.090
But I'd need a hardline
connection to the
server to do it.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.301
If we can get the lights back on
before they're ready,

19:38.344 --> 19:40.803
we could expose everything.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.515
Their lies, the invasion.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.850
What do you need?

19:45.894 --> 19:49.061
I need to go to Estonia.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.125
Fuck.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.171
Robert?

20:17.258 --> 20:19.133
What is it?

20:23.681 --> 20:26.140
Come.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.351
Come with me.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.111
Berlin is a beautiful city.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.073
You can breathe here.

20:42.116 --> 20:45.117
You got <i> cojones.</i>

20:45.161 --> 20:48.871
Brokering a half-billion dollars
worth of art that isn't yours,

20:48.915 --> 20:52.708
that, indeed, takes <i> yaytsa.</i>

20:52.752 --> 20:56.420
So let's get on with it.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.547
Call him.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.926
I'm gonna need my phone back.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.220
I don't have his number
memorized.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.227
His name is Helmut Reinhardt.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.221
<i>Guten tag.
Auktionhaus Rosenthal.</i>

21:47.265 --> 21:48.889
Yeah, good afternoon.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.100
Uh, may I speak
to Helmut Reinhardt, please?

21:53.688 --> 21:55.563
May I ask who's calling?

21:55.606 --> 21:57.773
This is Manuel DiSanto.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.567
Can you please tell him
that it's urgent?

21:59.610 --> 22:02.361
I have a new client,
and we need a sit-down today.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.071
One moment.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.929
Yeah, it's Jeb.
I got a guy

22:08.953 --> 22:10.556
who needs to move
some highest-end art,

22:10.580 --> 22:12.163
just for show, today.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.583
You need to take his lead.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.961
This squares you with us.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.422
That's what I thought you'd say.

22:25.345 --> 22:28.763
Mr. DiSanto,
Mr. Reinhardt apologizes,

22:28.806 --> 22:31.390
but he's in the middle
of a very delicate negotiation

22:31.434 --> 22:34.268
and can't take your call.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.524
Um, yeah,
but did you tell him it's me?

22:40.568 --> 22:42.777
I did, and because it's you,

22:42.820 --> 22:45.029
he's agreed to meet your client
at 8:30.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.281
Does that work
with your schedule?

22:47.325 --> 22:50.242
Yeah, we'll make it work.
Thank you.

22:54.332 --> 22:55.998
Sounds like he's coming in hot.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.959
The art must belong to Krik.

22:59.003 --> 23:02.129
And if Torres' client
really is Platov,

23:02.173 --> 23:03.839
he's taking a huge risk.

23:03.883 --> 23:07.343
Yeah. He might just be helping
bankroll this invasion.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.053
Well, he's staying alive.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.097
That's his number-one priority,

23:11.140 --> 23:13.724
but he's also
serving up Platov on a dish.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.393
We can't arrest him.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.873
We've got no jurisdiction
over art transactions.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.439
No.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.274
But we do have
a very powerful friend

23:22.318 --> 23:24.193
who <i> does</i> have jurisdiction.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.171
Yeah.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.177
Okay.

23:58.813 --> 24:02.898
Robert, I understand that maybe
you can't tell me what's wrong.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.360
No, no, no, no.
I can't.

24:06.404 --> 24:09.363
I know it's hard
to be alone in a city,

24:09.407 --> 24:11.615
so far away from your family.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.220
You must miss your son a lot.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.869
I do.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.746
But still, I just keep moving
farther away from him.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.665
Where are you moving?

24:19.709 --> 24:21.500
Tokyo.

24:21.544 --> 24:22.793
Well, supposed to.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.253
Oh, how exciting.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.630
Yeah, if I don't get fired.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.550
From your job at the embassy?

24:29.594 --> 24:31.343
Why? What happened?

24:31.387 --> 24:34.054
I got someone killed.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.940
Are you serious?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.359
No. Come on.

24:47.403 --> 24:51.822
I analyze...
fucking economic fluctuations

24:51.866 --> 24:55.993
based on
political regime change.

24:56.037 --> 25:00.456
You know what?
I have to stop navel-gazing.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.977
Do you know what that is?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.542
Hmm?

25:03.586 --> 25:05.336
Obsessing, theorizing.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.232
My ex-wife always told me

25:07.256 --> 25:10.132
that I could have taught
a master class in paranoia.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.593
Paranoia is a part of life.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.657
Do you remember you told me that

25:15.681 --> 25:17.493
you did your residency
in Berlin?

25:17.517 --> 25:20.184
Yeah.

25:20.228 --> 25:23.395
There's no trace of you
ever having worked here.

25:23.439 --> 25:26.815
Oh, I... I use my mother's
maiden name professionally.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.734
Sadowsky.
Why?

25:28.778 --> 25:32.613
When I was in medical school,
there was a man, a doctor.

25:32.657 --> 25:36.909
He seemed kind at first.
Supportive.

25:36.953 --> 25:41.121
Then he started showing up at my
place at all hours, stalking me.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.332
It was awful.

25:43.376 --> 25:46.919
You have an answer
for everything.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.672
Robert, it isn't easy for me
to talk about it.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.110
It's easy for me to believe,
though, right?

25:52.134 --> 25:55.010
The first thing they teach us,
engage emotionally.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.764
The more you appear vulnerable,
victimized,

25:58.808 --> 26:02.560
the more I'm gonna want to
protect you, open up to you,

26:02.603 --> 26:06.772
be honest with you, right?

26:06.816 --> 26:09.275
Last week,
when I was in the shower,

26:09.318 --> 26:15.531
I-I could have sworn that
there was someone in my flat.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.784
You know, I s...
I saw my mail on your shelf.

26:18.828 --> 26:22.162
Oh. Your letters
got mixed in with mine.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.124
I put them there so that
I'd remember to give them back.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.626
And all the times...
All the times

26:27.670 --> 26:31.880
we've just happened
to run into each other?

26:31.924 --> 26:34.466
Which I thought was lovely.

26:36.846 --> 26:41.473
Which is exactly
what you would say...

26:41.517 --> 26:43.851
if you were a spy.

26:47.023 --> 26:50.774
I'm in touch with certain buyers

26:50.818 --> 26:56.405
who are always on the lookout
for pieces of this quality.

26:56.449 --> 26:59.783
How fast do you think you can
make these transactions?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.910
Hours, minutes.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.538
The responses
are already flooding in.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.708
An auction will no doubt
net you richer returns,

27:07.752 --> 27:12.463
but there's an advantage to
creating a "Buy Now" situation.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.883
For each of these masterpieces,

27:15.926 --> 27:19.094
there's an obscenely rich
Singapore CEO

27:19.138 --> 27:21.513
or Bahraini prince
who just wants bragging rights,

27:21.557 --> 27:24.600
no waiting.
So, purists,

27:24.644 --> 27:27.519
true art lovers, huh?

27:27.563 --> 27:32.483
I've already gotten firm offers
on six of the best pieces.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.693
No one's blinking at the prices.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.840
Perhaps we should have
asked for more.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.114
Considering
the accelerated schedule

27:39.158 --> 27:42.284
and these unusual circumstances,

27:42.328 --> 27:45.371
the sum you're looking to clear
is more than fair.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.040
So you can guarantee
$400 million?

27:48.084 --> 27:51.960
Right now,
we're looking at upwards of...

27:52.004 --> 27:54.672
Yes, $480 million.

27:56.592 --> 27:59.677
I'm so sorry, Mr. Reinhardt.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.720
Working late, Helmut?

28:01.764 --> 28:05.224
A global business needs to keep
international hours.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.537
You also have to work
under international laws.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.395
Yeah, who says I'm not?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.416
One of your buyers
is under indictment.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.983
He needs immunity more than
he needs a fucking Kandinsky.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.838
I also have a few
chain-of-custody questions

28:16.862 --> 28:18.904
for your current clients.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.406
<i>Bitte.</i>

28:35.756 --> 28:40.384
Well...
look who's in Berlin.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.072
What the fuck
are you doing here?

28:42.096 --> 28:44.430
It was a very good run,

28:44.473 --> 28:46.201
but now it's over, my friend.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.435
Never mistake
that we're friends.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.895
We just answer
to the same master.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.981
Oh.

28:59.321 --> 29:03.115
Oh, yes...

29:03.159 --> 29:07.578
except you don't wish
to answer to anyone any more.

29:07.621 --> 29:10.372
Isn't that right?

29:10.416 --> 29:14.960
I'm a humble servant
of Mother Russia.

29:15.004 --> 29:18.630
You're trying to finish
what Krik started.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.966
I understand.

29:22.887 --> 29:26.263
But this thing with the art
dealer was very, very foolish.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.599
We took a meeting.

29:28.642 --> 29:32.186
Hardly a criminal offense.

29:32.229 --> 29:37.274
Well, those difficult decisions
are not only yours to make.

29:37.318 --> 29:40.402
Moscow wants you to stand down.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.988
Estonia can wait.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.660
Do you hear what I said?

29:48.704 --> 29:51.997
Yes, thank you for your concern,
but I'm handling things.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.793
From your holding cell?

29:55.836 --> 29:57.419
In police custody?

29:57.463 --> 29:59.922
You delivered your message,
Kolya.

29:59.965 --> 30:03.550
Now go home
in your ridiculous cowboy boots

30:03.594 --> 30:05.302
and fuck yourself.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.106
Robert, I'm no spy.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.086
I don't even know what that
means in this day and age.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.528
No, don't, don't, don't. Just
stop, stop. Give me a second.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.613
I'm trying to make sense
of things here.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.218
You said your job
has you stressed,

30:26.242 --> 30:28.386
and yet I'm the problem,
y-your neighbor?

30:28.410 --> 30:29.868
What have I done?

30:29.912 --> 30:31.995
My watch.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.998
It... I w... There was this thing
that I was doing,

30:35.042 --> 30:38.043
and a signal was sent
when my watch was stopped.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.295
Your watch stopped?
It was stopped!

30:40.339 --> 30:43.048
It was a deliberate act!
The crown was bent.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.261
I don't understand.

30:47.304 --> 30:50.116
Did it make you late
to something important?
No, no.

30:50.140 --> 30:55.853
A message was sent to a man
to open his veins.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.564
I think you should leave.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.941
Why?
You have to get to work?

31:00.985 --> 31:03.193
Yes, I do have to get to work.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.048
I opened my door to you
because you were in trouble.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.467
I wanted...
Where do you work,
anyway, exactly?

31:07.491 --> 31:09.324
Charité Mitte.
Pediatrics.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.263
Yeah, and if I were to call
there right now,

31:11.287 --> 31:13.847
would somebody confirm
that Nina Bartek or Sadowsky

31:13.873 --> 31:16.433
or whatever the hell
your name is works there?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.333
Of course, they will confirm it.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.961
And if not, it's because
of the... of the privacy policy.

31:21.005 --> 31:23.358
Mm-hmm, right.
That's good.
I've just started there
last week.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.111
That's good.
That's good.
Take your hand
off my door.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.635
No, you tell me the truth,
and I will.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.558
My name is Nina Bartek.

31:34.602 --> 31:36.602
I'm a doctor from Gdansk.

31:38.480 --> 31:43.775
I... I love helping people.

31:43.819 --> 31:47.988
I hate salmon.

31:48.032 --> 31:52.910
My mother wants me to get out
more and meet nice people.

31:55.164 --> 32:00.542
When I told her about you,
how funny you are,

32:00.586 --> 32:03.670
how you talk so fast

32:03.714 --> 32:07.090
and look so handsome
in a suit...

32:09.261 --> 32:11.803
...she said that maybe
I don't have to get out more.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.932
Maybe what I need
is across the hall.

32:14.975 --> 32:19.561
And I was stupid enough to think
that maybe she was right.

32:24.068 --> 32:26.902
You told your mother about me?

32:30.157 --> 32:32.032
I'm sorry.

32:32.076 --> 32:36.536
I'm... I'm sorry
about all of this.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.913
Just go home, Robert.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.706
Like I said,

32:39.750 --> 32:42.584
I have a paranoid streak...

32:46.090 --> 32:48.450
...but it doesn't mean
I'm wrong.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.270
We're not going anywhere.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.200
Valerie.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.205
What are you doing here, Kolya?

33:20.249 --> 33:23.375
I just want to talk.

33:23.419 --> 33:26.294
That's a phone call.
This is intimidation.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.839
Off the record.

33:31.135 --> 33:32.884
I'm listening.

33:37.766 --> 33:40.183
You were right.

33:40.227 --> 33:44.438
The Kremlin
knew about Krik's plan.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.334
I was told to keep an eye on him

33:46.358 --> 33:49.818
and provide limited assistance,
if needed.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.029
Come on.
Moscow gave him free rein.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.009
Because he took all the risks.

33:54.033 --> 33:57.951
Now that Krik
is going to prison,

33:57.995 --> 34:01.371
we just want this to go away.

34:01.415 --> 34:04.416
Is that what Platov wants?

34:04.460 --> 34:06.460
Yeah, we already knew
that he was picking up

34:06.503 --> 34:09.087
where his boss left off.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.317
That was the last piece of intel
that Daniel Miller gave me

34:11.341 --> 34:14.134
before he was murdered.

34:14.178 --> 34:16.928
Did you provide
"limited assistance" with that?

34:16.972 --> 34:20.556
I knew he had Miller,

34:20.601 --> 34:24.061
but I don't know anything
about his death.

34:24.103 --> 34:28.023
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.442
You knew,
and you let them hunt him

34:30.485 --> 34:32.152
and beat him and murder him.

34:32.196 --> 34:35.989
Very few of us die in our sleep.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.243
What the hell do you want,
Kolya?

34:40.286 --> 34:44.039
I want to stop Platov.
He's a monster.

34:44.083 --> 34:48.960
He won't stop at the Baltics.
No.

34:49.004 --> 34:52.089
I will share everything I know.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.007
Troop movements
in the Gulf of Finland,

34:55.052 --> 34:58.887
first strike targets,
political restructuring.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.575
Don't you want to know
what's going to happen

35:00.599 --> 35:03.225
when this blackout ends?

35:19.827 --> 35:22.619
So, have you cleared this up
yet, Ms. Krug?

35:22.663 --> 35:24.454
What's not clear?

35:24.498 --> 35:26.768
You came to Berlin to sell art
that doesn't belong to you.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.542
It's called fraud.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.585
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.214
Oh, really?
Mr. Krik's art collection
is significant, yes...

35:34.258 --> 35:36.883
And yesterday,
you called Helmut Reinhardt

35:36.927 --> 35:39.030
to sell it off
in a high-end fire sale.

35:39.054 --> 35:42.055
I just asked him
how much it would sell for.

35:42.099 --> 35:45.809
As you know, the Kremlin
is prosecuting Mr. Krik.

35:45.853 --> 35:48.103
They need an accounting
of his estate

35:48.147 --> 35:51.565
and asked me
to have his art appraised.

35:51.608 --> 35:54.734
I met Mr. DiSanto
through a mutual friend.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.571
He arranged the appraisal.
That's all.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.259
So you didn't know
Mr. DiSanto

35:59.283 --> 36:01.803
was under investigation
for money laundering?

36:01.827 --> 36:03.785
No.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.121
He seemed very sincere
in offering to help,

36:06.165 --> 36:09.124
but, like I said,
I-I barely know him.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.146
And who would I call
at the Kremlin

36:11.170 --> 36:13.587
to verify this appraisal story?

36:13.630 --> 36:18.008
Yuri Voloshin at the Prosecutor
General's Office in Moscow.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.946
And you think they'll continue
to support you,

36:19.970 --> 36:21.990
even after you've been caught
red-handed?

36:22.014 --> 36:23.972
Support me in what?

36:30.189 --> 36:33.440
One last question.

36:33.483 --> 36:37.027
Did you kill Daniel Miller?

36:37.070 --> 36:38.945
Who?

36:41.366 --> 36:43.158
Am I free to go?

36:52.878 --> 36:56.213
If I learn
that you had anything to do

36:56.256 --> 36:58.757
with Mr. Miller's
torture or death,

36:58.800 --> 37:01.070
if you so much as
moved his body,

37:01.094 --> 37:04.137
I will track you down,
pull you into the streets,

37:04.181 --> 37:07.515
kicking and screaming,
and shoot you in the head.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.768
And that's a promise.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.787
Mr. Torres,
you're free to go.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.622
So you know who I am?

37:30.666 --> 37:34.501
Valerie Edwards contacted me
as soon as you called in.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.964
Where's Platov?

37:39.007 --> 37:40.215
We released him.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.008
What?

37:42.052 --> 37:44.970
What?!
Jesus Christ!

37:45.013 --> 37:47.305
Do you know how hard I worked
to get him here?!

37:47.349 --> 37:50.558
We tried to hold him.
The Kremlin's protecting him.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.144
Maybe I can call him,
re-establish some trust.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.355
No, you can't.

37:55.399 --> 37:59.693
I said you were going down
for money laundering.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.987
Great.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.822
Great.

38:06.743 --> 38:11.329
Well, did, at least, Hector and
Daniel make it out of Komarovo?

38:11.373 --> 38:15.125
I don't... I don't know
about Hector, but...

38:15.168 --> 38:17.210
Daniel didn't make it.

38:25.554 --> 38:27.304
I'm sorry.

38:29.308 --> 38:32.017
Thank you for what you did.

40:00.899 --> 40:04.567
<i>Information Resources,
extension 6144, please.</i>

40:04.611 --> 40:07.362
Did you discharge
a firearm or weapon of any sort

40:07.406 --> 40:11.116
during your time
in St. Petersburg or Komarovo?

40:11.159 --> 40:14.411
A flamethrower.
And at any time,

40:14.454 --> 40:16.766
did you feel that you were
in danger of losing your life?

40:16.790 --> 40:18.665
Yes, ma'am.

40:18.708 --> 40:23.420
Um, that was
a distinct possibility, yeah.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.672
Officer Torres,

40:25.715 --> 40:28.275
do you feel that you are fit
to return to the field of duty?

40:32.347 --> 40:35.765
I am fit and eager to return.

40:35.809 --> 40:37.809
Thank you.

40:37.853 --> 40:39.519
You can get dressed.

40:41.022 --> 40:45.066
Hey, Rafa.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.276
Hey.

40:51.366 --> 40:55.618
Well, that healed up nicely.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.807
Yeah, it did.
How about you?

40:57.831 --> 41:01.332
Well, special activities...
Price of admission.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.799
So, how did I do?

41:09.843 --> 41:11.676
They want to bench you.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.761
I still need to get Basarov.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.014
Sergei Basarov is dead.

41:16.057 --> 41:19.392
Well, Platov's still out there.

41:19.436 --> 41:23.521
Rodion, several thousand
Little Green Men.

41:23.565 --> 41:25.418
We know they're out there,
but the administration

41:25.442 --> 41:27.942
is choosing to turn a blind eye.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.154
So, don't they listen to you?

41:32.908 --> 41:34.824
I'm up for directorship.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.428
All the right people
are behind me on it.

41:39.623 --> 41:43.082
So, as long as
you turn a blind eye?

41:43.126 --> 41:44.709
What the fuck, B.B.?

41:44.753 --> 41:48.004
I ran through a forest
carrying a burnt body.

41:48.048 --> 41:50.048
I faced off with Spetsnaz

41:50.091 --> 41:54.636
and drug-addled weapons dealers,
oligarchs.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.888
What are you doing?

41:56.932 --> 41:58.640
Hmm?

42:06.107 --> 42:10.485
I may end up another
chiseled star on your wall,

42:10.529 --> 42:13.071
but at least I tried.

42:57.409 --> 43:00.535
Officer Torres.
Valerie Edwards.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.078
Welcome to Berlin Station.

43:02.122 --> 43:03.955
Thank you.
April Lewis.

43:03.999 --> 43:05.518
Good to meet you in person.

43:05.542 --> 43:06.708
Call me Rafa.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.084
Come.

43:12.048 --> 43:15.800
So, where's my boy, Kirsch?

43:15.844 --> 43:17.510
Wolfe has him on leave

43:17.554 --> 43:19.679
while we're investigating
Daniel's death.

43:19.723 --> 43:21.347
The powers that be

43:21.391 --> 43:23.975
really trying to hamstring
you guys on this one, huh?

43:24.019 --> 43:26.339
Mm-hmm.
It's a genuine clusterfuck.

43:28.398 --> 43:31.649
Hey.
I'll take you to the SCIF.

43:34.863 --> 43:36.591
May I ask
what you're doing here?

43:36.615 --> 43:38.114
I'm here to help.

43:38.158 --> 43:39.949
I don't believe
I asked for your help.

43:39.993 --> 43:42.994
Everyone in D.C. knows
I'm in line to lead it all.

43:43.038 --> 43:45.663
Folks want to do favors for me.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.602
Much as I tell myself
it was for the greater good,

43:47.626 --> 43:49.395
I made a bad call in Nice,
and...

43:49.419 --> 43:52.253
I'd like to make it right
before it's too late.

43:55.634 --> 43:59.761
If I let you into my house,
you're on my side.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.471
Is that clear?

44:01.514 --> 44:03.181
Mm-hmm.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.728
Kolya confirmed Robert's theory

44:08.772 --> 44:11.981
that troop ships are stationed
off the Gulf of Finland,

44:12.025 --> 44:14.817
and there are upwards
of about 4,000 men

44:14.861 --> 44:17.862
ready to land
in Parnu in the west

44:17.906 --> 44:19.989
and Narva in the east

44:20.033 --> 44:24.911
and about 6,000 men
headed for Tallinn.

44:24.954 --> 44:26.788
They probably already
had Little Green Men

44:26.831 --> 44:27.933
securing the Parliament.

44:27.957 --> 44:29.435
Rodion and his Little Green Men

44:29.459 --> 44:31.084
will not be wearing
any insignias.

44:31.127 --> 44:34.545
That means that NATO
cannot fire until fired upon.

44:34.589 --> 44:36.567
And considering
how well Krik and Platov

44:36.591 --> 44:38.903
have been manipulating
this civil war narrative,

44:38.927 --> 44:41.552
I bet they're gonna
try to put the blame on NATO.

44:43.556 --> 44:47.558
Let me go back to Tapa.
I promised the NATO guys.

44:47.602 --> 44:50.853
Look, this war has many fronts,
but it's the political coup

44:50.897 --> 44:52.667
that's gonna sell this
to the world.

44:52.691 --> 44:54.816
Kolya confirmed that

44:54.859 --> 44:57.443
they are going to fake
an emergency referendum.

44:57.487 --> 45:00.071
They're going to elect a new PM.
- Just like Ukraine.

45:00.115 --> 45:02.865
I wonder who the puppet is that
they're putting on the throne.

45:02.909 --> 45:06.494
My money is on Igor Savisaar.

45:06.538 --> 45:08.204
Estonian nationalist.

45:08.248 --> 45:10.184
Savisaar wanted
the Article 5 vote.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.686
He wanted NATO to stop Russia.

45:11.710 --> 45:13.813
But he bet they wouldn't.
Okay?

45:13.837 --> 45:15.564
And ever since
the NATO vote tanked,

45:15.588 --> 45:18.025
he's been saying the West,
and in particular, America

45:18.049 --> 45:19.924
let Estonia down.

45:19.968 --> 45:22.488
He even suggested that maybe
it's time to let Russia step in

45:22.512 --> 45:24.387
and quell the civil unrest.

45:24.431 --> 45:26.158
So if a loyal son of Estonia

45:26.182 --> 45:28.494
says that Russia is keeping
peace, then it must be true.

45:28.518 --> 45:30.162
I wonder how much
they're paying him.

45:30.186 --> 45:32.729
Doesn't matter because
as soon as the lights come up

45:32.772 --> 45:36.065
and Russia raises her flag over
Tallinn's parliament, it's over.

45:36.109 --> 45:39.110
How long do we have?
Kolya doesn't know.

45:39.154 --> 45:41.882
I called in a favor
with General Lancer
in the North Atlantic.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.574
He's putting up a drone to get
eyes on the Gulf of Finland.

45:44.617 --> 45:47.118
We can track their movements,
plan a counteroffensive,

45:47.162 --> 45:48.514
and land a strike team
if needed.

45:48.538 --> 45:50.538
It's very fucking needed.

45:50.582 --> 45:53.499
Rodion Volkov
will be leading the troops.

45:53.543 --> 45:54.917
Met him at Krik's.

45:54.961 --> 45:56.355
He fought with the old guard,

45:56.379 --> 45:58.129
and he's now training
the new recruits.

45:58.173 --> 45:59.672
We take this guy out,

45:59.716 --> 46:02.675
and the sure thing
looks a lot less sure.

46:02.719 --> 46:05.887
Torres,
I want you to work with B.B.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.263
Find him.

46:07.307 --> 46:10.141
Stop him.
Copy that.

46:10.185 --> 46:12.935
They're using Tervik's server
to power the blackout.

46:12.979 --> 46:14.915
If we can get Sofia in,
she thinks that she can

46:14.939 --> 46:16.667
turn the lights on
before they're ready.

46:16.691 --> 46:18.274
Can't she do that from here?

46:18.318 --> 46:20.546
They have malware firewalls
set up for remote access,

46:20.570 --> 46:23.613
but they can't block Sofia
if she plugs in directly.

46:23.656 --> 46:26.616
So you want to put her
on the X in Estonia,

46:26.659 --> 46:28.451
where all hell
is breaking loose?

46:28.495 --> 46:31.078
They will kill her immediately.

46:31.122 --> 46:34.040
Sofia Vesik is the best
political counter we have

46:34.083 --> 46:36.042
to Savisaar right now.

46:36.085 --> 46:37.794
When the time is right.

46:37.837 --> 46:40.087
The only time that matters
is now.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.291
It's not pretty,
but it's what we have to do.

46:44.219 --> 46:45.927
All right.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.930
I want you to take in
our best ITT guys.

46:54.062 --> 46:56.979
With air traffic control down,
there are no flights to Estonia.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.481
No commercial flights.

46:58.525 --> 46:59.941
Military transport?

46:59.984 --> 47:02.235
I thought your government
was backing down.

47:02.278 --> 47:05.112
Yeah, they have,
but B.B. hasn't.

47:05.156 --> 47:08.241
Ma'am?
This is a restricted area.

47:08.284 --> 47:09.720
There's no access to the runway.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.472
You need to go back
to that booth over there

47:11.496 --> 47:13.788
and talk to the nice man who...

47:13.832 --> 47:16.457
Nice man was clever enough
to ask for my credential

47:16.501 --> 47:19.210
<i>before</i> he started to
patronize me, Sergeant.

47:19.254 --> 47:21.379
Ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.067
How can I be of assistance?

47:23.091 --> 47:25.675
I need to get these folks on
the ground... Tapa and Tallinn.

47:25.718 --> 47:28.614
No can do.
Estonia's dark right now.
Well, light it up.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.157
You've got a C-130 lying around
somewhere.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.909
I understand you're National
Security Council, ma'am,

47:31.933 --> 47:33.202
but it's not that easy.

47:33.226 --> 47:35.726
It is, and I represent
the White House.

47:35.770 --> 47:38.123
In about two minutes,
your phone is gonna ring,

47:38.147 --> 47:40.042
and it won't be your boss
or your boss's boss.

47:40.066 --> 47:42.086
It'll be my boss,
and he'll be cranky

47:42.110 --> 47:45.069
being woken up
in the middle of the night.

47:45.113 --> 47:46.590
You know who my boss is, right?

47:46.614 --> 47:48.406
I do, ma'am.

47:49.659 --> 47:51.284
I'll find you a plane.

47:51.327 --> 47:52.994
Smart man.

47:53.037 --> 47:58.165
Molly always said
I took this job too seriously.

47:58.209 --> 48:02.461
She thought I gave it so much
more than I gave our marriage.

48:02.505 --> 48:04.297
Maybe she was right.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.633
But it wasn't even deliberate.

48:07.677 --> 48:09.343
The obsessive focus.

48:09.387 --> 48:11.365
My brain just keeps
spinning on problems

48:11.389 --> 48:13.639
until they're solved.

48:13.683 --> 48:16.809
I'm probably a little OCD.

48:16.853 --> 48:19.896
But someone
really has been watching me,

48:19.939 --> 48:22.148
reading my e-mails,
and sit-reps.

48:22.191 --> 48:24.420
How else could they know
to set up Bankole Inyang?

48:24.444 --> 48:27.945
He was killed yesterday
on a crowded Berlin street

48:27.989 --> 48:30.406
with a weapon
no bigger than a pen...

48:33.161 --> 48:38.581
...by someone who had enough
medical knowledge to use it.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.295
Mm.

48:44.339 --> 48:47.548
It's so hard to believe that
someone as beautiful as you

48:47.592 --> 48:51.093
could blend in with the crowd.

48:51.137 --> 48:53.554
All of it.

48:53.598 --> 48:56.474
Confirm the codes,
make your payment,

48:56.517 --> 48:59.268
and I can arrange delivery of
the art out of St. Petersburg

48:59.312 --> 49:01.395
within 24 hours.

49:16.663 --> 49:17.995
<i>Da.</i>

50:21.894 --> 50:24.729
You're a survivor, Blake.
I'll give you that.

50:38.995 --> 50:41.037
Halt!

50:45.752 --> 50:47.043
Weapons on the ground!

50:53.217 --> 50:55.259
Don't shoot.

50:55.303 --> 50:57.845
We are Russian peacekeepers.

50:57.889 --> 51:00.639
We are here to help.

51:07.648 --> 51:11.275
Stop there.

51:11.319 --> 51:12.526
What do you want?
