Announcer:

00:16.935 --> 00:18.603
You are Kunta Kinte.

00:18.687 --> 00:19.938
Behold!

00:21.022 --> 00:23.191
The only thing
greater than yourself.

00:26.528 --> 00:30.949
The first duty of a Mandinka
warrior is to raise a family.

00:34.953 --> 00:37.789
- [laughs]
- [cheering]

00:51.886 --> 00:55.682
It's time your family paid for all
the trouble they have caused me, Kunta.

00:55.765 --> 00:56.808
Run!

01:05.483 --> 01:08.111
Sell the boy to the British

01:14.743 --> 01:16.161
[thunder crashes]

01:18.455 --> 01:21.291
[gunshots, indistinct shouting]

01:26.087 --> 01:28.840
- No more running for you, boy.
- No! No!

01:28.923 --> 01:29.924
No, please don't!

01:30.967 --> 01:31.968
[screams]

01:32.385 --> 01:35.180
I'm so relieved
you're gonna make it.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.931
My name is Belle.

01:37.015 --> 01:38.725
Let's make it official.

01:38.808 --> 01:41.603
[both laugh]

01:41.686 --> 01:44.147
[applause]

01:44.230 --> 01:46.983
I never thought I'd be able
to have another child.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.652
I'll protect our child.

01:49.736 --> 01:51.696
Kizzy, I think I was selfish

01:51.780 --> 01:54.324
to have you born
into a world like this.

01:54.407 --> 01:57.368
Don't worry, Fa.
You trained me well.

01:57.452 --> 01:59.788
Kizzy!
No! No, Kizzy!

01:59.871 --> 02:01.998
[crying]

02:02.123 --> 02:03.750
No!

02:04.751 --> 02:06.711
- Fa!
- Kizzy!

02:07.712 --> 02:09.714
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

02:09.798 --> 02:12.383
- This is my right!
- Kill me!

02:12.467 --> 02:13.927
[baby crying]

02:14.010 --> 02:15.804
I'm gonna name you
after my daddy...

02:15.887 --> 02:18.223
George Lea II.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.852
# One day, one day #

02:22.936 --> 02:25.271
# One day, one day #

02:25.355 --> 02:27.440
# I were walking along #

02:27.524 --> 02:29.609
# I were walking along #

02:29.692 --> 02:31.778
# And I heard a little voice #

02:31.861 --> 02:34.072
# And I heard a little voice #

02:34.155 --> 02:36.032
# Didn't see no one #

02:36.157 --> 02:38.201
# Didn't see no one #

02:38.284 --> 02:40.286
# It was old lost John #

02:40.370 --> 02:42.330
# It was old lost John #

02:42.413 --> 02:44.499
# He said he was long gone #

02:44.582 --> 02:46.376
# He said he was long gone #

02:46.459 --> 02:48.670
# Like a turkey
through the corn #

02:48.753 --> 02:50.672
# Like a turkey through the corn #

02:50.755 --> 02:52.674
# With his long clothes on #

02:52.757 --> 02:54.401
- # With his long clothes on #
- [moaning and grunting]

02:54.425 --> 02:56.427
[breathing heavily]

03:02.433 --> 03:04.435
[sighing deeply]

03:24.622 --> 03:26.624
- [sighs]
- [chickens clucking]

03:28.543 --> 03:30.378
Seems hotter today
than yesterday.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.880
Yes, Massa.

03:31.963 --> 03:34.173
Sky just sits on you.

03:34.257 --> 03:40.388
When I was a boy, I'd spend a day like
this just sitting buck naked in the creek.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.723
[spits]

04:38.947 --> 04:40.949
[speaking Mandinka]

04:57.298 --> 04:59.342

05:11.396 --> 05:12.480
[gasps]

05:12.563 --> 05:13.690
Why are you here?

05:13.773 --> 05:16.776
He pretty.
I wanted to touch him.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.153
He could scratch the prying eyes
from your head.

05:19.237 --> 05:21.823
I'm gonna tell Massa Tom
to beat the hell out of you.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.658
Make sure you stay away
from my chickens.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.326
Now get!

05:34.002 --> 05:35.795
[rooster crows]

05:38.756 --> 05:40.174
Mama.

05:40.258 --> 05:41.968
N-Not in my front of my boy,
Massa Tom.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.344
Get up, George.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.431
You need to learn!

05:46.514 --> 05:48.725
George, what'd you do?
What... What'd he do, Massa?

05:48.808 --> 05:51.019
Little monkey
keeps bothering Mingo,

05:51.102 --> 05:53.646
messing with my birds
in the range walk.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.314
Mingo's got too much
work to do, boy.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.150
George, them birds
will hurt you.

05:57.233 --> 05:58.901
You scared of them birds?

06:00.069 --> 06:01.922
Then I'm gonna put
your yellow ass up on the wagon

06:01.946 --> 06:03.489
when Mingo and me
go out and fight.

06:03.573 --> 06:04.949
You're gonna help.

06:05.033 --> 06:08.536
Mingo don't like children.
He... He don't like people.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.204
Get your clothes on, boy.

06:19.839 --> 06:23.301
- You look pretty in this light, Kizzy.
- Please. He watching us.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.928
Can I hold the bird, Massa Tom?

06:26.012 --> 06:28.473
You do what Mingo
tells you to do.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.475
And you be on
your best behavior,

06:30.558 --> 06:32.560
or I'll sell you
to Cherokee savages.

06:38.483 --> 06:39.734
[breathes heavily]

06:41.611 --> 06:44.113
Oh, Fa.

06:44.197 --> 06:47.575
Papa, he trying to take my boy.

06:49.202 --> 06:52.455
George: Massa Tom, why you start
fighting chickens?

06:52.538 --> 06:55.583
Gamecocks, George,
not chickens.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.668
And I fight them
'cause they're magic.

06:57.752 --> 07:01.130
Carried me from a backwoods shack
with 10 brothers and sisters...

07:01.214 --> 07:03.466
Abracadabra.
Bought my own farm.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.384
Bought my first nigger.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.012
His name was George,
like yourn.

07:08.096 --> 07:11.265
Tough old boy.
Died too fast.

07:11.349 --> 07:13.768
- He my daddy?
- Your daddy's long gone.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.229
No-account white man,
passing through.

07:16.312 --> 07:18.064
Gave you that yellow skin.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.941
Second nigger I bought
was Mingo.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.651
Best move I ever made.

07:21.734 --> 07:24.445
Man: Wants this all clear
by sundown.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.365
See that land over there?

07:27.448 --> 07:31.077
Biggest farm in Carolina
ain't enough for Mr. William Byrd.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.954
That bastard hates me
'cause I'm Irish

07:33.037 --> 07:35.581
and 'cause my daddy
was backwoods poor.

07:35.665 --> 07:37.291
Thinks he knows who I am.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.211
He don't know a damn thing
about Tom Lea.

07:41.212 --> 07:44.257
Thinks he's prince
of Caswell County.

07:44.340 --> 07:46.968
Hell, I'm gonna be king
of Caswell County.

07:47.051 --> 07:50.304
- Pay what you owe, Irish!
- I'll pay you in a week!

07:50.388 --> 07:52.682
Oyez! Oyez!

07:57.562 --> 08:00.356
Whoa! Hit him!
Don't tickle him!

08:00.481 --> 08:01.899
Ooh!

08:01.983 --> 08:04.819
Oyez! Oyez!

08:04.902 --> 08:08.906
The main match...
a struggle to the death.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.450
- I give you Tom Lea...
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

08:11.534 --> 08:12.869
...and Farnie Deets.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.954
Announcer: Bring that cock
to the pen, Mingo.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.664
- You get him, Mingo!
- Let's go, Mingo!

08:18.332 --> 08:19.876
Look at my Red.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.879

- Unh-unh.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.254

08:24.255 --> 08:26.215

08:30.428 --> 08:32.471

08:34.056 --> 08:35.892

08:35.975 --> 08:36.976
Step back.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.020

08:40.438 --> 08:42.273
[roosters clucking]

08:42.356 --> 08:44.275
[indistinct shouting]

08:47.528 --> 08:48.779
Man 2: Go, Red!

09:34.408 --> 09:37.495

- Hey! Mingo!
- Oh, I love your money, boys!

09:50.049 --> 09:52.677
You can all win it back
at the next county fair.

09:55.388 --> 09:57.265
Mingo, big Red all right?

10:03.312 --> 10:04.605
Piss.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.483
Piss on the damn bird, boy.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.069
You sure this good
for the bird?

10:10.152 --> 10:11.988
You think you Massa Tom?

10:12.071 --> 10:14.073
Don't ever question me
about these birds.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.617
I tell you to do something,
you just do it.

10:16.701 --> 10:18.786
Think you know.
Don't know nothing.

10:18.869 --> 10:22.415
Don't know the Lord gave chickens worst
things in the world...

10:22.498 --> 10:25.209
pip, distemper, apoplexy,

10:25.293 --> 10:27.211
cholera, lime leg, and canker.

10:27.295 --> 10:30.423
You don't know pee clean
like a good turpentine.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.804
Yeah.
All right.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.973
I don't know why we even
brought you along, no way.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.349
'Cause Massa Tom
says I can help.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.852
- How?
- I talk to your birds.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.062
Talk nothing but hot air.

10:45.146 --> 10:47.565
Birds use they eyes to talk.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.775
Got to hold your stare.

10:49.859 --> 10:53.279
Turn your head away,
show you weak.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.406
[grunts]

10:55.489 --> 10:57.116
Stand up.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.703
Got to be a man when you messing
with these birds.

11:00.786 --> 11:04.915
Such a big help you is,
Chicken George.

11:08.919 --> 11:12.798
Patricia:
"The first cut of...

11:12.882 --> 11:17.595

11:25.061 --> 11:26.937
What's this say, Kizzy?

11:29.357 --> 11:30.733
Favorable.

11:31.859 --> 11:37.698
"...favorable
on a cool...

11:37.782 --> 11:39.492
day."

11:39.575 --> 11:41.952
Yes.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.871
[laughs]

11:43.954 --> 11:47.083
Never thought nobody could learn
farming by reading, Kizzy.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.711
Need to read something to tell me
how to act around fancy ladies.

11:50.795 --> 11:54.632
Bit of gossip,
weather, fashion.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.467
The more you talk
about nothing,

11:56.550 --> 11:58.511
the smarter them ladies
think you be.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.347
- Lea: Whoa!
- [horse whinnies]

12:01.430 --> 12:04.350
You won't tell Massa Tom
I been teaching you.

12:04.433 --> 12:07.853
Whew!

12:07.937 --> 12:09.730
Why don't you pour me
a drink, Kizzy?

12:09.814 --> 12:11.357
Can't you see I'm parched?

12:12.608 --> 12:13.943
George!

12:16.737 --> 12:18.489
Oh, my God.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.616
Whose blood that is?

12:20.741 --> 12:22.952
- What Mingo do to you?
- I got clawed.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.370
Did they hurt you?

12:24.453 --> 12:27.623
Massa Tom said I held 'em real good,
and they true killers.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.166
Still waiting
on that drink, Kizzy.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.629
George, get over here.

12:34.672 --> 12:36.674
I got a question for ya.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.176
You want to keep fighting
gamecocks with Mingo and me,

12:39.260 --> 12:41.846
or you want to get sunburned
working them fields?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.889
Want to work with Mingo...
and you!

12:44.890 --> 12:46.892
Massa, he a big help

12:46.976 --> 12:51.063
Mama, I like them birds,
and they like me.

12:51.147 --> 12:52.940
Good boy.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.609
Now, you know you got to sleep
with them birds, too.

12:55.693 --> 12:58.654
Down by old Mingo.
That ain't no place for no little boy.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.322
Ah, you can visit him
every Sunday.

13:00.406 --> 13:03.451
I'm a fair man, Kizzy.
You know that.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.286
Be good for the boy.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.788
He gonna be my good luck charm.

13:07.872 --> 13:09.707
Ain't that right, Tricia?

13:09.790 --> 13:13.002
Well, uh, maybe
he could wait a year.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.005
What the hell you know about children,
since you can't have none?

13:20.968 --> 13:23.345
Boy, why you still
standing there?

13:23.429 --> 13:24.930
Go help Mingo with the birds.

13:25.014 --> 13:26.557
Yes, sir.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.393

13:29.477 --> 13:31.812
Boy's gonna be
my good luck charm, Kizzy.

13:40.196 --> 13:42.072
[chickens clucking]

13:46.285 --> 13:48.370
Here, boy.

13:50.414 --> 13:51.874
That's bird food, Mingo.

13:51.957 --> 13:56.212
Barley, milk, corn, rice,
and my secret...

13:56.295 --> 13:58.297
my own brewed hops.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.217
Let them niggers on the farm
eat flesh.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.011
What's good for birds
is good for men.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.639
You can game a bird
for 10 years.

14:06.722 --> 14:10.476
Take him from the cage,
leave him one step in the trees,

14:10.559 --> 14:13.354
he gonna turn back wild
just like that.

14:13.437 --> 14:16.190
'Cause these birds,
they from across the sea.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.567
In they hearts,
they always free.

14:18.651 --> 14:21.320
Mingo, can you teach me
all about birds?

14:21.403 --> 14:23.030
Teach me to fight them?

14:23.113 --> 14:26.408
What you think we is, friends?

14:26.492 --> 14:30.871
Come on, boy. I'll teach you
how to clean these cages.

14:50.099 --> 14:51.934
Oh, Mama.

14:52.017 --> 14:55.312
You look awful, and you stink.

14:55.396 --> 14:58.190
- It's the cocks.
- Ain't no cocks in here.

14:58.274 --> 15:02.027
Mama, I let all the birds free,
cage by cage!

15:02.111 --> 15:03.654
Big ones, Mama!

15:03.737 --> 15:05.573
And fed them
and helped Mingo fix them.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.366
Oh, you should've
seen it, Mama.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.661
All these white men saying, "Hey, Mingo,"
patting him on his back.

15:10.744 --> 15:14.248
Can you believe that, white men respecting
an old nigger like Mingo?

15:14.331 --> 15:18.043
And it was fun watching Massa Tom
smiling and strutting around.

15:18.127 --> 15:19.837
Hey, look.
He gave me money.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.381
Ain't nothing fun
about being with that man,

15:22.464 --> 15:24.425
no matter how they make
Mingo feel.

15:24.508 --> 15:28.053
- But Mama...
- Come here.

15:30.973 --> 15:34.351
Tom Lea ain't no better
than no other toubab.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.604
No matter how much laughing
they do,

15:36.687 --> 15:39.690
no matter how much you get
to play with them damn birds,

15:39.773 --> 15:43.027
Mingo a slave
at the end of it all.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.737
And you one, too.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.739
But Massa Tom likes me, Mama.

15:46.822 --> 15:51.327
He don't know
how to like nobody.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.708
And don't nobody love ya
like your mama.

16:02.588 --> 16:07.092
Go on, eat.
Wash up. Go to bed.

16:13.474 --> 16:15.309
Massa Tom like me.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.858
[bell tolling]

16:22.983 --> 16:25.277
[indistinct conversations]

16:30.532 --> 16:32.576
Whoa!

16:36.997 --> 16:38.540
Uh...

16:41.251 --> 16:45.005
- Miss Patricia.
- Thank you, George.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.634
I'll be at the church
in the trees when you want me,

16:48.717 --> 16:52.054
- ready to go home.
- Since when you a man of faith?

16:52.137 --> 16:54.640
Since you seen
that preacher's daughter?

16:55.724 --> 16:57.685
- Go on.
- Thank you, sir. Excuse me.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.228
Only last week, and I...

16:59.311 --> 17:02.648
- Morning.
- Keep walking.

17:03.649 --> 17:04.942
Patricia.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.530
- Mr. Byrd.
- [scoffs]

17:14.034 --> 17:16.036
[organ playing]

17:31.301 --> 17:34.763
How come I always end up
at the back?

17:34.847 --> 17:40.978
See, the Lord say that... that he
that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.461
Man: All right, Reverend.
All right.

17:42.521 --> 17:46.233
- But he who opens his lips...
- Woman: Yes, sir.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.194
- ...shall face destruction. Amen!
- Uh-huh.

17:49.278 --> 17:50.320
- Amen!
- Amen!

17:50.404 --> 17:52.156
- Hallelujah
- Amen!

17:52.239 --> 17:57.870
You see, wealth gathered
by vanity will diminish.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.413
And see, my eyes is old,

17:59.496 --> 18:01.915
but I can see
what the Lord says.

18:01.999 --> 18:06.879
See, the Lord tells us
beware of flattering lips

18:06.962 --> 18:10.799
and men who speak
with double hearts.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.885
Truth is your sustenance.

18:12.968 --> 18:17.181
And beware that man who talk
about money and worship money.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.141
See, that, too, is vanity.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.893
[laughter]

18:20.976 --> 18:24.480
The righteous man eateth
to satisfy his soul!

18:24.563 --> 18:27.983
But the belly of the wicked
shall want chicken!

18:28.108 --> 18:29.485
[laughter]

18:29.568 --> 18:31.361
And taters!

18:31.445 --> 18:33.489
'Cause a full belly
is a righteous belly!

18:33.572 --> 18:34.865
Whoo!

18:34.948 --> 18:36.867
[bawking] Chicken!
Oh, chicken!

18:36.950 --> 18:38.202
Everybody need chicken!

18:39.912 --> 18:42.706
I told you what I'd do.
You keep it up every Sunday.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.750
So rude and disrespectful
to my daddy.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.877
Oh, Lord, help me now.
I got a she-wolf on me.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.212
My daddy is a kind man.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.006
You just a flim-flam fool
not fit to walk in my daddy's shadow.

18:51.131 --> 18:54.885
Don't you have love in your heart
for anybody but yourself?

18:56.637 --> 18:58.013
Hang on, now.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.449
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.451
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Move away or I'll whop you again.

19:01.475 --> 19:02.893
And I deserve it.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.604
Ain't got no right to be mocking
your daddy. He a fine preacher.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.314
Look around.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.983
More folks watching me
than listening to him.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.551
Now, if all these folk,
tired from working so hard every day,

19:13.612 --> 19:15.781
will stop to hear
the word of the Lord,

19:15.864 --> 19:20.494
does it really matter if it comes
from the mouth of a fool like me?

19:20.577 --> 19:22.746
"Thy lips are as the honeycomb.

19:22.830 --> 19:25.165
Honey and milk
are on thy tongue.

19:25.249 --> 19:29.169
Thou art all fair,
my love."

19:29.253 --> 19:31.588
I heard your daddy preach that
from King Solomon's songs.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.342
Save your pretty talk.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.970
You see me giggling
and swooning?

19:38.971 --> 19:41.431
Hm. I know one thing.

19:41.515 --> 19:44.476
- You ain't never met a girl like me.
- Well, maybe not.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.645
I'm not a pious man
like your daddy,

19:46.728 --> 19:48.897
but I know you ain't
let go of my hand yet.

19:48.981 --> 19:50.232
[gasps]

19:50.315 --> 19:52.109
I'm George.
Live on the Lea farm.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.944
I know who you is,

19:54.027 --> 19:56.280
and I know all you care about
is fighting chickens.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.407
I do.
Know about other birds, too...

19:58.490 --> 20:01.159
starling, sparrow,

20:01.243 --> 20:02.995
mourning doves
sing so sweet and soft,

20:03.078 --> 20:05.831
make you want to open your eyes
to a new day.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.042
And I'm gonna see you again,
my mourning dove.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.796
My daddy decides who courts me.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.298
Well, I ain't afraid
of your daddy.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.216
Then why don't you try me out?

20:18.510 --> 20:19.887
Hold this, Til.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.973
You got something
to say to me, boy?

20:26.602 --> 20:31.023
Now, I can feel
the Holy Spirit right here...

20:32.107 --> 20:33.984
right now!

20:35.402 --> 20:36.945
Mm! Whoo!

20:37.029 --> 20:40.240
Hallelujah!
You my one and only.

20:47.873 --> 20:50.959
He gonna put the fear of God
in them other handlers.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.586
[rooster clucking]

20:52.669 --> 20:54.671
What the hell you doing, boy?

20:54.755 --> 20:56.840
Letting him see me
eye-to-eye.

20:58.050 --> 21:01.595
I want him to know my hands
till he thinks we the same, me and him.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.306
Just feed him, clean him,
and put him away.

21:11.688 --> 21:16.234
Mingo, I got a notion
from watching all these fights.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.861
Keep a count.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.238
Times we lose
mostly when some other bird

21:20.322 --> 21:22.699
get over Massa's bird,
gaff him from the top.

21:22.783 --> 21:26.578
I think we need to give Massa's birds
a whole lot of training for they wings,

21:26.662 --> 21:29.081
make them stronger
so they fly higher,

21:29.164 --> 21:30.999
win even more than they do now.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.918
I figured out
special exercises.

21:33.001 --> 21:37.255
You good at exercising your mouth,
but you don't know birds.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.800
Killing bred into the bird.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.469
Don't need no wing training.

21:42.552 --> 21:45.973
You don't do nothing
till I say so.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.684
Been doing this
'fore you was alive.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.065
[rooster crows]

22:02.155 --> 22:03.407
Get back here!

22:14.835 --> 22:18.213
What you doing to that bird?
What'd I tell you?

22:18.338 --> 22:20.090
You don't listen.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.591
Damn fool.

22:21.675 --> 22:24.094
Look how high I got him to fly.
Told you I could do it.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.560
I know what I see.
Damn truth.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.770
[coughing]

22:45.615 --> 22:47.826
Want my mama
to look at that cough?

22:47.909 --> 22:50.037
Don't need no African medicine.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.624
And don't you say nothing
about this to Massa Tom.

22:54.708 --> 22:57.044
[coughs]

23:06.261 --> 23:08.305
There's a gathering
down by the river tonight.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.642
Boys stopping by to play
for everybody.

23:12.726 --> 23:15.312
- Come with me.
- Don't need to see nobody.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.524
Malizy said she ain't never see you
come by to visit.

23:19.608 --> 23:22.319
Only see you driving out
or coming back here.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.780
Can't stay by yourself
all the time.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.114
Leave me be.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.742
You a shadow
on a moonless night.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.994
You ain't hardly here, Mingo.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.412
The way I like it.

23:34.539 --> 23:37.375
People say they know who I am.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.252
They don't know me.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.922
Say they care about me.

23:42.005 --> 23:45.092
Had too many people taken away

23:45.175 --> 23:48.261
'cause of gossip and tall tale.

23:48.345 --> 23:51.348
Can't trust nobody.

23:51.431 --> 23:56.645
These birds, they can cut my flesh,
not my inside.

23:56.728 --> 24:00.065
Trust my birds, no one else.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.776
Don't trust you, neither.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.867
[sighs]

24:14.830 --> 24:17.332
Announcer: Your bid is clear and ready.
Pit your cock!

24:17.457 --> 24:19.334
Come on!

24:19.459 --> 24:21.503
Come on!
Come on!

24:21.586 --> 24:23.713
- Get up!
- Get him!

24:23.797 --> 24:26.800
Lea: Come on!

24:26.883 --> 24:29.761
- Come on up! Come on! Get him!
- Lea: Come on, you son of a bitch!

24:29.845 --> 24:31.179
Fight him!

24:33.056 --> 24:35.934
That's it!
Come on!

24:36.017 --> 24:37.853
- Fight him, Mingo!
- Get him!

24:39.980 --> 24:41.857
Get him!

24:41.940 --> 24:43.900
Aw, come on!

24:43.984 --> 24:46.486
Mingo: Come on! Come on, now!
Come on!

24:46.570 --> 24:49.030
Get him!
Get him!

24:50.615 --> 24:52.617
- Fight him, Mingo!
- Get him!

24:52.701 --> 24:54.619
Come on! Rise up!

24:56.580 --> 24:57.914
Show him who we are!

24:57.998 --> 25:00.041
[indistinct shouting]

25:01.877 --> 25:02.878
Mingo!

25:02.961 --> 25:06.381
- It's over. It's done.
- Man: He's done.

25:06.506 --> 25:10.051
Announcer: Tom Lea resigns.
Match to Francis Dunnery.

25:10.135 --> 25:13.805
- Shit.
- Get your bets in, gentlemen.

25:13.889 --> 25:15.140
God damn me!

25:15.223 --> 25:18.268
I'll take a French pox and a screw
fore I lose this goddamn bet.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.644
Massa, I got a scheme.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.438
Mingo said his bird
was sure to win.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.273
I'm tired of working land.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.193
I ain't gonna wait till I'm old
to rise up where I should be.

25:26.276 --> 25:27.944
We need
these goddamn birds to win!

25:28.028 --> 25:29.279
I'll fetch the white.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.739
You can bet him hard.
Can't lose.

25:30.822 --> 25:32.574
Nuh-unh.
Use the Red for the next fight.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.242
- Red?
- No.

25:34.326 --> 25:35.952
No, he ain't trained.

25:36.036 --> 25:37.871
I trained him... myself.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.539
You sneaking 'round
'hind my back?

25:39.623 --> 25:42.584
Massa, all these birds attack head on,
maybe with a little jump.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.252
Now, I trained my Red
out in the woods.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.254
I dropped from a chestnut tree
high as a hawk,

25:46.338 --> 25:48.131
so he got wings stronger
than nothing else.

25:48.215 --> 25:49.841
Ain't no bird
gonna get above him.

25:49.925 --> 25:52.052
Ain't no bird gonna beat him.

25:52.135 --> 25:56.056
You think you can throw me out
like some used-up old bird

25:56.139 --> 25:58.850
just 'cause you
kissing Massa's ass?

25:58.934 --> 26:02.312
I raised these birds
since they was chicks.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.356
But I trained them right.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.690
I trained them better.

26:05.774 --> 26:07.025
Massa.

26:07.108 --> 26:10.779
I can still make you money.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.322
Whole lot.

26:16.576 --> 26:19.246
George, next fight's yours.

26:19.329 --> 26:22.457
Let's see if your scheme works.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.502
But, George,
if you lose this fight,

26:25.585 --> 26:29.089
you can forget about me
buying that Matilda gal.

26:31.049 --> 26:32.592
Son of a bitch.

26:42.769 --> 26:47.565
Tom Lea ain't never gonna forgive
poor old Mingo for losing his money.

26:47.649 --> 26:51.528
Tom Lea dreams of every penny
slipped through.

26:51.611 --> 26:55.198
I'm gonna win back
all them pennies and more.

26:55.282 --> 26:56.533
I hope not.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.868
You and me hack fighting next.

26:58.952 --> 27:01.997
Then, your Massa gonna be
terribly disappointed.

27:02.080 --> 27:06.084
I fight for myself.
Bought my papers three years ago.

27:06.167 --> 27:09.296
Now these my birds, my money.

27:11.548 --> 27:13.174
You a free man?

27:13.258 --> 27:14.718
Whole lot more than just me.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.804
Durham, Fayetteville.
You'll find us.

27:17.887 --> 27:21.516
But, yeah, I'm free.

27:21.641 --> 27:26.271
Till some sheriff wakes up
in a bad mood, has a sore tooth.

27:27.272 --> 27:31.067
Being free takes a watchful eye,
but I prefer it to the alternative.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.236
But how'd you get the money?

27:33.320 --> 27:36.406
Kept my hand in my own pocket,
coin by coin.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.991
Went without a lot of things.

27:38.074 --> 27:41.077
Kept looking ahead,
not regretting what got left behind.

27:41.161 --> 27:44.164
Way you carry yourself, I thought
for a minute you was free, too.

27:44.247 --> 27:45.957
I got a good Massa.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.918
Good enough to let you
buy yourself?

27:49.002 --> 27:52.047
He is giving you
a fine cut of his winnings.

27:55.175 --> 27:58.011
Think I'll take
your good Massa's money today.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.432
'Course, nobody knows you.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.476
Might be a skinny purse.

28:04.559 --> 28:08.104
These boys might need a push
to risk their money.

28:11.566 --> 28:13.902
Gentlemen, a hack fight!

28:13.985 --> 28:16.738
Birds... four pound six.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.365
Last wagers!

28:18.448 --> 28:20.617
Whoo!

28:20.700 --> 28:25.872
The ear of man has not heard
nor head has felt

28:25.955 --> 28:30.251
nor eye has seen
a bird such as this.

28:30.335 --> 28:31.669
[crowd murmurs]

28:31.753 --> 28:33.797
Wait.
Hang on now.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.799
I mislead you boys.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.926
This ain't no bird at all.

28:38.009 --> 28:40.845
This is a creature
you ain't never seen...

28:40.929 --> 28:42.472
half bird, half man,

28:42.555 --> 28:44.391
half of the forest,
half of my own soul.

28:44.474 --> 28:45.809
Now, what do y'all
think of that?

28:45.892 --> 28:47.143
[cheers]

28:47.227 --> 28:49.771
I'll take $500, sir.

28:49.854 --> 28:51.398
And I'll give it.

28:51.481 --> 28:53.316
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.902
Now, you are all men
of refinement and discretion,

28:55.985 --> 28:57.779
but why'd y'all
come here today?

28:57.862 --> 29:00.240
For a simple
gambling diversion?

29:00.323 --> 29:02.826
To take a chance against a fine
man like my Massa Tom Lea?

29:02.909 --> 29:04.619
No.

29:04.744 --> 29:08.248
You crave wonderment,
jubilation, revelation!

29:08.331 --> 29:11.584
Ooh, glory!
That's what you came to see!

29:11.668 --> 29:14.546
This bird, this uncommon,
fearsome campaigner

29:14.629 --> 29:15.922
leaves the barn in victory!

29:16.005 --> 29:18.299
You will cry tears that you've seen
the last of him,

29:18.383 --> 29:20.844
and you will yearn for more!

29:20.927 --> 29:23.430
I yearn to win my money back,
Chicken George.

29:23.513 --> 29:27.183
- [laughter]
- All right.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.601
[crowd chanting
"Chicken George"]

29:28.685 --> 29:30.603
I like it.
Yes, sir!

29:30.687 --> 29:34.065
[chanting continues]

29:34.149 --> 29:37.735
Come on!
Put your money on me, boys!

29:37.819 --> 29:39.320
Bet $1,000?

29:39.404 --> 29:42.198
If you have faith
in your Chicken George.

29:42.282 --> 29:44.742
Always happy
to take your money, Jewett.

29:44.826 --> 29:49.456
What you got, boy?
What you got?

29:49.539 --> 29:53.084
Announcer: Place your birds.

29:53.168 --> 29:56.296
You put on a good show
for your Massa, didn't you?

29:56.379 --> 29:58.590
Come on now, George.

30:03.386 --> 30:04.971
Step out.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.024
Pit your cocks!

30:21.571 --> 30:23.198
[rooster squawks]

30:27.827 --> 30:30.371
[indistinct conversations]

30:30.455 --> 30:33.333
- No hard feelings, right?
- None at all.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.084
Just make sure
some of that pot is yours.

30:35.168 --> 30:37.253
You staying around these parts?

30:37.337 --> 30:39.380
For a while, long as it's safe.

30:39.464 --> 30:40.924
Come by the Easter picnic.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.848
I want to hear more about what it takes
to get that paper make you free.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.180
Now, if you'll excuse me...

30:47.263 --> 30:49.766
go ask Massa for my cut.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.100
Man: Pay the man his money.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.435
Thank you.

30:52.519 --> 30:55.605
Your Chicken George has skill.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.525
- I had more skill to see it.
- [chuckles]

30:58.608 --> 31:01.152
Mr. Lea, as one gentlemen
to another,

31:01.236 --> 31:03.363
I'd like to buy
the boy from you.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.074
Buy my George?

31:06.157 --> 31:09.577
I inquire merely because I understand
you've acquired debt on your farm

31:09.661 --> 31:11.204
for equipment, seed, and stock.

31:11.287 --> 31:15.375
What happened to your nigger?
I heard he was a good man with the birds.

31:15.458 --> 31:18.419
Boy forgot his pass while traveling
to buy gamecocks for me.

31:18.503 --> 31:23.007
Patrol scared him.
He ran, and they shot him.

31:23.091 --> 31:25.677
Sorry for your inconvenience.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.805
Name your price,
but I'd have this boy.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.640
No.

31:30.723 --> 31:33.935
Not now.
Not never.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.980
Never is a long time.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.984
And never to you, sir.

31:44.445 --> 31:47.073
May I invite you and your lovely wife

31:47.156 --> 31:49.909
to dine at our table
at the Easter picnic?

31:51.911 --> 31:53.162
You can expect it.

31:53.246 --> 31:54.789
I look forward to it.

31:55.039 --> 31:57.000
- Mr. Jewett.
- Mr. Lea.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.334
Gentlemen.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.924
Man:
Got lucky this time.

32:05.008 --> 32:06.467
[laughs]

32:06.551 --> 32:09.637
Here we come, George,
just like I said. Here we come.

32:09.721 --> 32:11.806
Look, Massa, some folks
saying it's a custom

32:11.931 --> 32:15.018
to give me a bigger piece
of the pot when I win big.

32:15.101 --> 32:19.022
Did Mingo tell you that?
Son of a bitch.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.356
[sighs]

32:25.528 --> 32:26.904
You won me lots of money, sir.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.573
Thanks, George.
You won me plenty today.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.533
Thank you. Thank you.
All right.

32:31.534 --> 32:35.288
I think I'm gonna save up
my money, just like you, Massa.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.623
You earned it.

32:36.706 --> 32:38.958
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.376
Thank you, Massa.
Thank you.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.379
Ah, we're winning, George.

32:43.463 --> 32:47.592
Boy, come on.
You ain't got no money.

32:47.675 --> 32:48.968
Shit.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.230
I'm gonna do something
for you, George.

33:01.314 --> 33:03.274
I need younger field hands.

33:03.358 --> 33:06.736
Old Pompey and Malizy gonna be
used up sooner than later.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.280
Old Sarah don't work
so hard right now.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.658
So if that gal's fool enough
to jump the broom

33:11.741 --> 33:14.243
with someone who loves
running tail as much as you,

33:14.327 --> 33:16.454
I'll ride over
and talk to MacGregor.

33:16.537 --> 33:18.706
If he's got as many hands
as you say,

33:18.790 --> 33:20.458
he ought not to miss
a field gal.

33:20.541 --> 33:21.876
Thank you, Massa.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.837
That's if we come
to a decent price.

33:24.921 --> 33:27.465
Then you can move that gal...

33:27.548 --> 33:30.426
- What's her name?
- Matilda.

33:30.510 --> 33:32.720
You can build Matilda
a cabin at my place.

33:32.804 --> 33:36.224
Long as you understand
your first place is with my birds.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.725
The way it should be.

33:37.809 --> 33:40.019
And I expect you
to keep her belly full.

33:40.103 --> 33:43.815
Keep them babies sliding out,
increase my stock.

33:43.898 --> 33:47.485
I'll make my money back,
and more.

33:47.568 --> 33:49.779
Kizzy like this gal?

33:49.862 --> 33:52.490
I wouldn't want to get
on her bad side if I were you.

33:57.662 --> 33:59.038
[Kizzy chuckles]

33:59.122 --> 34:01.749
All this spinning
is making me dizzy.

34:01.833 --> 34:04.293
One, two, three.
That's how they do it.

34:04.377 --> 34:05.628
[both laugh]

34:05.712 --> 34:09.215
- Where you get all this finery?
- Oh, I bought these.

34:09.297 --> 34:12.342
Massa pays us a little
when our birds win.

34:12.427 --> 34:15.513
Money ain't nothing
but a butterfly to you...

34:15.596 --> 34:17.306
come pretty and go fast.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.601
You don't need
no fancy clothes.

34:23.146 --> 34:26.983
- Mama, you need to meet somebody.
- What you need me to come for?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.775
She Matilda.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.154
She hardheaded, but I like her.
Come on.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.864
I thought you said
tonight was our night.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.784
You and that girl connived
this whole coming together.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.539
- Matilda.
- I'm Matilda, ma'am.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.292
This my father, Reverend Lyon.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.712
Your son say
you a woman of, uh, faith.

34:47.795 --> 34:50.630
I am.

34:50.715 --> 34:52.341
But it ain't your faith.

34:52.425 --> 34:54.594
I ain't interested
in the white man's God.

34:54.677 --> 34:57.263
My daddy say the only reason
our folk is

34:57.346 --> 34:59.682
- is 'cause it got beat into us.
- The Lord say that...

34:59.766 --> 35:02.059
Mama, why don't we get
our guests something to eat?

35:02.143 --> 35:04.771
Uh, I ain't offended.
I know my God's real.

35:04.854 --> 35:07.398
He love me,
and He love you, too.

35:07.482 --> 35:08.816
Amen.
Let's dance, Mama.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.735
You ever preach
from the book of Exodus?

35:10.818 --> 35:12.361
Well, I...

35:12.445 --> 35:14.089
White preacher
don't let no slave preacher man

35:14.113 --> 35:16.449
talk about the Israelites
or Pharaoh, do they?

35:16.532 --> 35:19.660
No slaves marching
across the sea to be free.

35:19.744 --> 35:22.497
Bet them pages cut
right out your Bible.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.457
Start preaching about Exodus,

35:24.540 --> 35:27.043
find yourself swinging
from a low limb.

35:27.126 --> 35:30.087
Mama, folks say make the best
of a hard situation.

35:30.171 --> 35:33.216
Maybe that's all folks
who believe in God trying to do.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.092
Have his God
make slavery go away,

35:35.176 --> 35:37.220
I'll meet you
in church every Sunday.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.314
[laughter]

36:08.251 --> 36:12.171
My daddy likely to beat you
if he hear you playing like that.

36:12.255 --> 36:15.383
Mama, I make Massa money.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.677
Truth is,
I know the white gamblers

36:17.760 --> 36:19.929
bet more just to see me.

36:20.012 --> 36:22.890
All that stuff
matter more to him than you.

36:22.974 --> 36:24.851
It ain't our way.

36:24.934 --> 36:27.979
I heard about some slaves
buying their freedom nowadays.

36:28.062 --> 36:31.482
More famous I get,
more I get a chance to buy my freedom.

36:31.566 --> 36:33.651
You think you gonna buy
your freedom?

36:33.734 --> 36:35.278
Mine, yours.

36:36.946 --> 36:38.906
Mama, I want to marry Matilda.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.951
- I can look after all of us.
- Do you love her?

36:42.034 --> 36:44.996
She a good woman, Mama.

36:45.079 --> 36:46.330
Different than everybody else.

36:46.414 --> 36:48.833
She's smart,
stubborn, like you.

36:48.916 --> 36:51.794
She's so pretty.

36:51.878 --> 36:53.671
Not as pretty as me,
but she pretty.

36:53.754 --> 36:56.257
You can't make no plans
depend on Massa.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.386
You mean so much to me.

37:01.804 --> 37:04.849
Let me teach you how to read
so you can be your own man.

37:04.932 --> 37:07.393
I'll always be my own man.

37:07.476 --> 37:11.063
Only knew one other somebody

37:11.147 --> 37:13.482
live his life trying to be
his own man...

37:13.566 --> 37:16.986
your grandpapa, Kunta Kinte.

37:17.069 --> 37:20.072
With them roosters,
I can do anything.

37:20.156 --> 37:22.241
That's how I'm getting free.

37:22.325 --> 37:25.995
That's how we're all
getting free.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.247
Come on, Mama.
They ain't gonna play all night.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.917
You go.
I'm gonna stay here,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.294
spend some time
talking with my daddy.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.838
Mama, you can't...

37:35.922 --> 37:37.465
You go.

38:00.988 --> 38:02.823
[indistinct conversations]

38:02.907 --> 38:06.452
Mrs. Shubal, breakfast
looks delightful, does it not?

38:06.535 --> 38:10.539
Mr. Jewett: It's a beautiful day,
isn't it? My favorite holiday.

38:10.623 --> 38:13.626
- Mr. Lea, Miss Patricia.
- Morning, Reverend.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.629
Your hat, sir?

38:27.098 --> 38:29.308
George, what are you doing?

38:29.392 --> 38:32.853
Well, there's Tom Lea
and his lovely wife, Patricia.

38:32.937 --> 38:34.772
Good morning,
Mr. Lea.

38:34.855 --> 38:36.649
Good morning,
Mr. Jewett.

38:36.732 --> 38:39.026
- Mrs. Lea.
- Morning.

38:39.110 --> 38:41.278
Mrs. Jewett:
Good morning, Mrs. Lea.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.114
Morning, Mrs. Jewett.

38:45.908 --> 38:47.159
[chuckles]

38:47.243 --> 38:48.953
Please, allow me.

38:49.036 --> 38:51.622
[chuckles]
Thank you, Mr. Jewett.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.874
There you are.

38:53.958 --> 38:57.253
Now, our table is complete.

39:02.049 --> 39:06.512
Mama, this is Marcellus,
free man I told you about.

39:06.595 --> 39:10.266
I'm not sure which one of y'all
is the bad influence.

39:10.349 --> 39:14.145
I'm not sure anyone
has much sway over your boy.

39:14.228 --> 39:17.356
Seems like his spark
can dazzle anyone.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.443
Now it's obvious
he gets that from you,

39:20.526 --> 39:23.362
which makes his daddy
a lucky man.

39:23.446 --> 39:26.866
- My mama lives alone.
- Just like I like it.

39:26.949 --> 39:28.617
I'd never have some man
bossing me around,

39:28.701 --> 39:30.494
acting like he my second massa.

39:30.578 --> 39:35.124
Ma'am, there are two things
I'll never understand:

39:35.207 --> 39:38.794
A man who mistreats
a woman who loves him...

39:38.878 --> 39:40.379
That's one.

39:40.463 --> 39:44.717
Oh, the other would be
a man who can't appreciate

39:44.800 --> 39:47.678
a woman who knows her own mind.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.730
I thought you were a free man.

39:57.813 --> 40:02.318
Who's freely deciding to carry this tray
for a beautiful woman.

40:05.196 --> 40:09.200
Anyone can see that Jackson
is too boorish to be president.

40:09.283 --> 40:12.286
He's a warmonger
and an adulterer.

40:12.411 --> 40:16.624
Only ignorant men without land
or education would back him.

40:16.707 --> 40:18.084
Tom.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.879
I say Old Hickory's gonna be
a damn good president.

40:21.962 --> 40:24.215
He'll protect cotton investors
clearing out woods

40:24.298 --> 40:27.093
in Mississippi and Alabama.

40:27.176 --> 40:31.347
- Yeah, I'll vote Jackson.
- My point proven.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.265
This country will sink
into a cesspool

40:33.349 --> 40:35.184
if we keep giving
lowborn men a vote.

40:35.267 --> 40:38.229
Mrs. Jewett: We're going by train
to New York to visit my cousin.

40:38.312 --> 40:41.065
Her husband has a position
with new clothiers...

40:41.148 --> 40:42.650
Mr. Lord and Mr. Taylor.

40:42.733 --> 40:48.239
But she warned us that the streets are
foul with horse droppings and Irish.

40:48.322 --> 40:50.157
[chuckles]

40:52.368 --> 40:53.689
What have I ever done
to you, sir?

40:55.538 --> 40:57.748
I pay no attention
to you at all...

40:57.832 --> 40:59.083
sir.

40:59.166 --> 41:02.086
I offer conversation and good
cheer on a fine holiday.

41:02.169 --> 41:05.714
And yet you poke, poke, poke me
like a damn hog.

41:05.798 --> 41:07.049
[laughs]

41:10.261 --> 41:11.762
I demand you tell me why.

41:11.846 --> 41:13.556
Take your hands off me.

41:13.639 --> 41:16.308
Let's go. Can't stop
these men once they start.

41:16.392 --> 41:18.394
I have no idea
if they're clean.

41:18.477 --> 41:20.104
God damn me.

41:20.187 --> 41:24.275
On Easter Sunday, in front of my wife
and these good people?

41:26.318 --> 41:27.987
- [screams]
- Look at me, Byrd!

41:28.070 --> 41:33.993
I see you clearly, sir,
exactly as they all see you.

41:34.076 --> 41:36.287
You bungle you farm
till it's near in ruin,

41:36.370 --> 41:38.706
waste your money
on drink and gambling.

41:38.789 --> 41:40.541
Earn a penny, spend a dollar...

41:40.624 --> 41:42.251
Oh, that's the Irish.
I know them.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.003
Scrub all you will, sir.

41:44.086 --> 41:46.672
The dirt is not
under your nails, sir.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.757
It's in your soul.

41:48.841 --> 41:50.843
And I'd dine with niggers
before I'd dine with you.

41:52.928 --> 41:54.930
[indistinct shouting]

41:55.014 --> 41:56.849
Get off of me!
Get off me!

41:56.932 --> 41:59.059
Get your hands off me,
you son of a bitch!

41:59.143 --> 42:02.104
I'll geld you, you bastard.

42:02.188 --> 42:04.773
You need to come home, Massa!

42:04.857 --> 42:06.400
I'm worth 10 like you.

42:06.525 --> 42:08.861
You never did a hard day's work
in your life.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.362
Soft hands, like a woman.

42:10.446 --> 42:12.781
You think your money
makes you a man?

42:12.865 --> 42:15.326
I'm the only real man
in this goddamn county.

42:15.409 --> 42:16.911
Son of a bitch!

42:16.994 --> 42:19.538
I do not settle my battles
with fisticuffs,

42:19.622 --> 42:21.749
like some drunken bar brawler.

42:21.832 --> 42:23.667
You settle this
however the hell you will.

42:23.751 --> 42:26.337
For once, act like a gentleman.

42:26.420 --> 42:29.882
Allow me satisfaction
in the field... a duel.

42:29.965 --> 42:31.258
Face-to-face.

42:31.342 --> 42:33.969
Whenever and wherever you say.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.348
You bucket of piss!

42:38.349 --> 42:39.642
You'll stand by me, George.

42:39.725 --> 42:41.644
Attend my weapons,
be my second.

42:41.727 --> 42:44.563
You ain't fired a gun in a while, Massa.
Let it be. We got...

42:44.647 --> 42:48.025
George, I need you
to do this for me.

42:48.108 --> 42:51.528
- I depend on you.
- Yes, Massa.

42:51.612 --> 42:53.656
Patricia.

42:53.739 --> 42:57.409
Can't no slave be 'round no white men
when they get like this.

42:57.493 --> 42:59.954
Massa Byrd can kill you
without thinking.

43:00.037 --> 43:02.706
And ain't no sheriff
gonna do nothing 'bout it.

43:02.790 --> 43:06.210
- Kizzy, he can't say no.
- Yes, he can.

43:06.293 --> 43:07.711
But he too caught up and concerned

43:07.795 --> 43:09.964
about that no-count cracker
and his birds.

43:10.047 --> 43:11.858
What you think gonna happen
if Massa Tom get killed?

43:11.882 --> 43:14.468
Think Miss Patricia
gonna sell us all together?

43:14.593 --> 43:16.238
She gonna run off
to the woods she came from,

43:16.262 --> 43:18.573
and we gonna end up on paddle wheelers
for cotton Mississippi.

43:18.597 --> 43:20.683
Why can't you understand?

43:20.766 --> 43:23.644
You can't risk your life
for that man.

43:23.727 --> 43:25.688
Not for him...
for us.

43:25.771 --> 43:28.440
I need to keep Tom Lea
alive for us.

43:31.318 --> 43:33.153
George.

43:33.237 --> 43:36.448
Not by chance, not any of this.

43:38.784 --> 43:41.120
There's the man
wants your massa dead.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.458
Massa Jewett?

43:46.542 --> 43:49.295
If Tom Lea is killed,
he's gonna buy your son.

43:49.378 --> 43:52.464
Tom Lea made a mistake
refusing his offer for George.

43:52.548 --> 43:54.758
And the thing
about rich white men,

43:54.842 --> 43:56.927
they'll take 10 steps at a tilt

43:57.011 --> 43:59.722
just to take one step
straight to what they want.

44:09.315 --> 44:11.317
[thunder rumbles]

44:15.029 --> 44:16.989
[horse whinnies]

44:18.073 --> 44:19.408
Mingo: Whoa.

44:28.042 --> 44:30.294
You think you doing this
for your family.

44:30.377 --> 44:32.880
But I known you
since you was a little boy.

44:32.963 --> 44:35.632
I know the love you got
inside you for Massa.

44:35.716 --> 44:39.136
You thinking maybe one tiny
piece of him inside the same.

44:39.219 --> 44:41.013
Make you as stupid as he is.

44:41.096 --> 44:43.390
He ain't never gonna see you
for what you truly is

44:43.474 --> 44:45.351
no matter what you think.

44:45.434 --> 44:48.854
Pardon me
if I don't wish him luck.

44:51.815 --> 44:53.108
[horse whinnies]

45:10.042 --> 45:11.752
[smooches]

45:17.049 --> 45:19.134
I'll look after him.

45:27.518 --> 45:30.521
Less likely to string
the two of us up,

45:30.604 --> 45:33.232
but I've been wrong before.

45:44.159 --> 45:46.203
High card will decide
who fires first.

45:46.286 --> 45:49.206
You will then separate
and face each other.

45:49.289 --> 45:52.751
On my command, you will each
discharge your pistols in succession.

45:52.835 --> 45:55.546
If you both remain alive,

45:55.629 --> 45:59.383
you will proceed with swords
until one of you is dead.

46:04.847 --> 46:06.098
- Five diamonds.
- [chuckles]

46:11.353 --> 46:12.855
Three clubs.

46:12.938 --> 46:15.691
Mr. Lea will shoot first.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.610
And may God have mercy
on your souls.

46:20.863 --> 46:22.865
[horse neighs]

46:29.705 --> 46:32.374
This your day.

46:32.458 --> 46:34.877
Take your time.

46:34.960 --> 46:38.797
Got to wait till your eyes see clear,
breathing even.

46:38.881 --> 46:41.467
You hear me?
Take your time.

46:41.550 --> 46:43.594
I know, George.

46:43.677 --> 46:46.388
I intend to kill him
with my first shot.

46:48.849 --> 46:50.559
[exhales]

47:05.532 --> 47:07.409
You're my only true friend.

47:08.410 --> 47:11.497
Do this friend a favor.
Kill that son of a bitch.

47:14.625 --> 47:17.002
Your first shot,
Mr. Lea.

47:28.388 --> 47:30.474
Still shaking,
didn't even take aim.

47:30.557 --> 47:32.893
Mr. Byrd.
First shot.

47:32.976 --> 47:34.228
[pistol cocks]

47:39.191 --> 47:41.652
Goddamn.
This can't be.

47:42.945 --> 47:45.364
Aah!
[grunts]

47:51.703 --> 47:53.956
You do this next shot
right, now.

47:54.039 --> 47:57.334
Take your time.
Nice and steady.

47:59.711 --> 48:01.672
If you niggers interfere,
we'll kill you!

48:01.755 --> 48:03.549
Be sure of that!

48:03.632 --> 48:07.177
Duel judge:
Second shot, Mr. Lea.

48:09.263 --> 48:10.514
[pistol cocks]

48:20.065 --> 48:21.316
[exhales]

48:25.112 --> 48:27.823
[screams]

48:30.993 --> 48:33.328
Mr. Byrd, second shot.

48:53.807 --> 48:55.058
Aah!

48:56.059 --> 48:57.394
Duel judge: Gentlemen.

48:57.477 --> 48:58.812
[screams]

48:58.937 --> 49:02.149
Gentlemen.
Do either of you yield?

49:02.232 --> 49:04.735
Byrd: No.

49:04.818 --> 49:06.612
No!

49:06.695 --> 49:08.071
Mr. Lea does not yield!

49:08.155 --> 49:10.616
Gentlemen, swords!

49:12.993 --> 49:14.411
Sword.

49:15.537 --> 49:17.080
Duel judge:
Damn it, Byrd, yield.

49:17.164 --> 49:19.499
He's bleeding hard.
Can't let him find his legs.

49:19.583 --> 49:20.834
Get right at him.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.169
No! Get away.

49:22.252 --> 49:23.629
I can't feel my hand, George.

49:23.712 --> 49:25.172
You take this sword.

49:25.255 --> 49:27.135
You got to fight hard
if you want to stay alive.

49:27.174 --> 49:28.925
Now get on your damn feet!
Get up!

49:29.009 --> 49:30.886
[grunts]

49:31.887 --> 49:33.138
- Get up!
- Byrd: Sword!

49:33.221 --> 49:35.974
- Put it in my hand.
- Chicken George: Come on!

49:36.058 --> 49:38.101
- Got it.
- George: Get up!

49:38.185 --> 49:39.436
[grunts]

49:46.693 --> 49:48.320
Aah!

50:15.597 --> 50:17.933
- No, no.
- [groans]

50:19.643 --> 50:21.436
Massa, you stay down,
you gonna die.

50:21.520 --> 50:22.771
That what you want?

50:22.854 --> 50:24.690
Is that what you came here
for today?

50:24.773 --> 50:26.024
[groans]

50:27.567 --> 50:29.528
Him on his feet,
looking down on you?

50:29.611 --> 50:31.279
The way everybody
look down on you?

50:31.363 --> 50:34.741
He say you dirt.

50:34.825 --> 50:36.305
That's how we'll bury you
if you want,

50:36.326 --> 50:38.245
deep in the damn dirt!

50:38.328 --> 50:40.956
Mr. Lea, do you yield?

50:41.039 --> 50:42.833
George, it hurts so bad.

50:42.916 --> 50:45.335
Oh, you in the pit now, Massa.

50:45.419 --> 50:47.003
Want to let him jeer you,

50:47.087 --> 50:49.089
throw your carcass
in a dung hole?

50:49.172 --> 50:50.424
Byrd: Step back, boy!

50:50.507 --> 50:52.676
- Rise up high. You the gamecock now.
- Get up, George.

50:52.759 --> 50:54.553
Rise up! Come down
on this son of a bitch!

50:54.636 --> 50:56.346
Rise up, Tom Lea, come on!

50:56.430 --> 50:58.306
Come on, show them all!

50:59.391 --> 51:01.101
Show him, Tom!

51:06.773 --> 51:08.275
[screams]

51:15.741 --> 51:17.033
Aah!

51:17.117 --> 51:19.327
- No, Massa!
- I yield! I yield!

51:19.411 --> 51:21.663
- I yield.
- He yields! Let him be!

51:25.292 --> 51:27.794
I'm a better man than you.

51:29.421 --> 51:32.090
He yielded!
It's time for mercy.

51:38.013 --> 51:39.806
All right.
I got you, I got you.

51:39.890 --> 51:41.725
- I got you.
- Mr. Byrd! Mr. Byrd!

51:41.808 --> 51:44.311
Folks are gonna talk
about what you did today.

51:44.394 --> 51:46.271
All across Carolina,
they'll say,

51:46.354 --> 51:48.732
"Tom Lea is a gentleman."

51:48.815 --> 51:52.861
I was... a fine gentleman.
[breathing heavily]

51:52.944 --> 51:55.864
They're gonna say my name,
ain't they... Tom Lea.

51:55.947 --> 51:58.116
For sure.

52:00.118 --> 52:01.953
Take me home, George.

52:03.830 --> 52:05.707
Take me home.

52:16.510 --> 52:18.220
[rooster crows]

52:44.746 --> 52:47.999
You over there?

52:48.083 --> 52:50.210
[coughs]

53:05.100 --> 53:08.728
I'd have bled my soul out
on that field.

53:08.812 --> 53:13.191
You pushed me hard.
Kept me strong.

53:13.275 --> 53:16.194
You don't win,
what happen to all of us?

53:16.278 --> 53:20.156
Damn right.

53:20.240 --> 53:21.950
I want to tell you something.

53:26.246 --> 53:30.083
I was 11 years old
when I hit the road,

53:30.208 --> 53:32.627
asking for a job.

53:32.711 --> 53:34.629
I ate scraps.

53:34.713 --> 53:37.340
Nights I'd chew bark.

53:38.842 --> 53:41.177
Dry leaves my only blanket.

53:41.261 --> 53:43.096
Froze my ass.

53:43.221 --> 53:44.639
[coughs]

53:44.723 --> 53:48.727
The whole lot of you
has it a damn lot easier.

53:48.810 --> 53:52.105
Oh, any man with eyes
can see that.

53:52.230 --> 53:54.774
[chuckles]

53:54.858 --> 53:57.360
Oh, hell, George.

53:57.444 --> 54:00.572
I ain't as bad as some.

54:00.655 --> 54:03.617
What do I always say?

54:03.700 --> 54:05.577
Make me rich.

54:05.660 --> 54:08.163
Raise yourself up.

54:10.081 --> 54:11.416
That's how money works.

54:14.502 --> 54:18.048
Then I'd like some of that money
to start working to get me papers...

54:19.299 --> 54:21.176
...to be free.

54:22.719 --> 54:24.721
[grunts]

54:26.306 --> 54:27.724
I intend to work hard.

54:27.807 --> 54:30.268
Win every cock fight,
make you real rich.

54:32.646 --> 54:36.900
I got to know a time gonna come
when I can buy me free.

54:40.904 --> 54:42.822
I don't see why not, George.

54:44.574 --> 54:46.409
It's all dollars and cents.

54:52.082 --> 54:56.086
When the number's right,
I promise...

54:57.462 --> 55:00.465
I'm gonna write
those papers for you.

55:03.343 --> 55:06.221
Then I'm gonna make you
so damn dirty rich,

55:06.304 --> 55:09.683
gonna need to buy a new wagon
just to load the moneybags.

55:09.766 --> 55:13.436
[laughs]

55:13.520 --> 55:17.232
Oh, you and me think
the same way, George.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.651
I brought you up right.

55:19.734 --> 55:22.112
She ought to thank me.

55:33.790 --> 55:37.544
One, two, three.

55:37.627 --> 55:39.421
Oh!

55:41.840 --> 55:44.718
Thank y'all.
Thank y'all.

55:44.801 --> 55:46.344
Man: Congratulations.
Bless you.

55:48.972 --> 55:50.432
Oh.

55:53.643 --> 55:56.396
[laughter]

55:57.772 --> 56:00.650
I promise to stay
by your side forever.

56:00.734 --> 56:02.193
I never had a daddy,

56:02.277 --> 56:04.988
but my baby's gonna have me
all the time.

56:05.071 --> 56:07.699
Nothing ever gonna pull me
away from you.

56:07.782 --> 56:11.161
That's all I want, George.

56:12.162 --> 56:15.123
May the Lord keep
and bless this holy union.

56:15.206 --> 56:17.459
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

56:17.542 --> 56:18.918
All right.

56:22.589 --> 56:23.840
Woman: Yes, sir.

56:24.841 --> 56:27.844
It was so nice of Mama Kizzy
to lend me her dress for the wedding.

56:27.927 --> 56:28.928
So beautiful.

56:29.012 --> 56:30.388
[laughs]

56:36.770 --> 56:38.271
What you know about that?

56:38.396 --> 56:41.399
You ain't the only one know
about African tradition.

56:41.483 --> 56:43.818
You declaring your intention?

56:43.902 --> 56:46.446
Expect so.

56:46.529 --> 56:47.906
[laughs]

56:47.989 --> 56:49.574
That make you dizzy?

56:49.657 --> 56:52.285
No, dance didn't make me dizzy.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.330
Just feel like I fit
right in your arms.

56:55.413 --> 56:57.082
My arms can go wide,

56:57.165 --> 56:59.959
- they can come tight.
- [laughs]

57:00.043 --> 57:03.088
But I do what I can
to make the fit work.

57:07.133 --> 57:08.426
[hoarse] George.

57:16.142 --> 57:18.686
Why is that man always
showing off your boy?

57:18.770 --> 57:20.939
For better or worse,
they got a bond.

57:21.022 --> 57:24.442
What we got is a bond.

57:24.526 --> 57:28.738
What they got,
something completely different.

57:31.241 --> 57:32.842
Glad to see you're
feeling better, Massa.

57:32.867 --> 57:38.289
We can get back on the road,
make some money.

57:38.373 --> 57:40.373
Of course it's gonna take
your first year's salary,

57:40.375 --> 57:43.545
pay me back for buying
that Matilda gal from MacGregor.

57:43.628 --> 57:46.548
She worth every penny.

57:46.631 --> 57:51.970
You get to making babies,
increase my stock.

57:52.053 --> 57:57.600
And when a boy comes,
Tom would be a fine name for a boy.

57:57.684 --> 58:01.855
- Ain't that right, Sarah?
- Strong name, Massa.

58:01.938 --> 58:03.398
Tom it'll be, Massa.

58:04.899 --> 58:06.901
If it's a boy.

58:06.985 --> 58:08.486
Patricia: George.

58:08.570 --> 58:11.197
I think you mama's sweet
on that boy.

58:11.281 --> 58:13.241
I ain't never seen mama
in a mood like this.

58:13.324 --> 58:15.326
Wakes up happy.

58:16.995 --> 58:19.873
- She always pretty when she smiles.
- Patricia: Mm-hmm.

58:19.956 --> 58:21.875
[drumming]

58:25.211 --> 58:28.006
You know what they call
a free nigger in North Carolina?

58:31.050 --> 58:32.343
Nigger.

58:43.438 --> 58:45.023
[clears throat]

58:45.106 --> 58:48.401
Folks sure did miss you
at the wedding.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.820
Smoothest liar I ever met.

58:50.904 --> 58:52.530
Thank you.

58:52.614 --> 58:55.283
[chickens clucking]

58:55.366 --> 58:57.410
[rooster crows]

58:57.535 --> 58:59.162
Bet your mama
gonna be after you

58:59.245 --> 59:01.039
to hatch some chickens
of your own.

59:01.122 --> 59:03.875
Not if he gonna name
the first one Tom.

59:03.958 --> 59:07.670
Miss Kizzy, congratulations
on your happy day.

59:07.754 --> 59:11.633
It was happy, till I heard my boy promised
his firstborn son

59:11.716 --> 59:13.676
gonna carry Massa's name.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.678
Me and Matilda gonna have
lots of babies.

59:15.762 --> 59:18.598
Plenty of names to go around.
Maybe even Mingo.

59:18.681 --> 59:21.976
You can't name no one
in this family after that man.

59:24.437 --> 59:26.689
Gonna go gather up some wood
for my fire.

59:28.566 --> 59:30.818
I know how to handle
Tom Lea, Mama.

59:30.902 --> 59:33.363
Ain't no handling no massa,

59:33.446 --> 59:35.365
especially not one
like Tom Lea.

59:35.448 --> 59:37.367
It's just a name, Mama.

59:37.450 --> 59:39.994
A name is who you is.

59:40.078 --> 59:44.040
My daddy took whippings
night and day to protect his name.

59:44.123 --> 59:45.667
What is it you want from me?

59:45.750 --> 59:48.670
Wouldn't make no sense to say
'cause I ain't never gonna get it.

59:48.753 --> 59:52.090
I shouldn't be surprised
you act the way you do.

59:52.173 --> 59:55.510
But don't you ever
get no shame, George.

59:55.593 --> 59:57.053
I'm famous
up and down this county.

59:57.136 --> 59:59.138
I know who I am,
and you should, too.

59:59.222 --> 01:00:00.848
Only time I knew who you was

01:00:00.932 --> 01:00:03.476
was when I took your yellow ass
out to the spot

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:05.019
where I stood and named you.

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:08.398
Well, I ain't trying to be
no beat-down African with half a foot!

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:14.821
You ain't nowhere near
the man my daddy was.

01:00:14.904 --> 01:00:18.491
Some time I look at you,
and I see Tom Lea.

01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:21.661
I can't even tell you 'part.

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:25.081
And it break my heart.

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:41.389
[chickens clucking]
[goat bleats]

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:43.308
[humming Binta's lullaby]

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.771
It's pretty.

01:00:48.855 --> 01:00:51.232
Came up from Durham way?

01:00:51.316 --> 01:00:52.817
[chuckles]

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.819
Came from my papa.

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:58.239
Came from Juffure, from Africa.

01:00:58.323 --> 01:01:01.159
What don't come from Africa,
according to you?

01:01:01.242 --> 01:01:02.535
Hey, no, no.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.954
[chuckles]

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:11.127
I spent my life
in a cabin like this.

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:13.129
And now that I'm free,

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:16.049
I'd rather sleep
under the stars.

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:19.677
Kizzy.

01:01:21.346 --> 01:01:23.264
I'm always passing
through places,

01:01:23.348 --> 01:01:25.683
so I find it best
to speak my mind.

01:01:27.477 --> 01:01:30.772
I want you to come with me.

01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:33.232
- What would we do?
- Go north...

01:01:33.316 --> 01:01:36.486
Pennsylvania, Vermont.

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.530
I'm tired of pulling out
my papers

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:42.367
every time some sheriff
gets in a mood

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:44.660
or some cracker
don't like my look.

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.913
I like your look.

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:57.256
Getting free
was all my daddy ever wanted.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:01.594
- But I'd be so far from George.
- Far is free.

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:06.599
Your boy has his own life now.

01:02:07.934 --> 01:02:10.103
It's time you loved yours.

01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:14.941
[footsteps approach]
That's Massa Lea.

01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:25.243
Didn't know you were
entertaining, Kizzy.

01:02:25.326 --> 01:02:28.871
Now you see,
so you can go on home.

01:02:28.955 --> 01:02:30.748
This is my property, boy.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:34.752
I own it and everything on it.

01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:37.880
Then turn a profit on what you own.
I want to buy Kizzy.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.718
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:42.802 --> 01:02:44.137
I'd have to reckon it.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.722
Name your price...
any number.

01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:48.182
I can pay it.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.310
Ain't you a businessman?

01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:52.812
[chuckles]

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:58.151
Well, she's almost past having babies.
That's in your favor.

01:02:58.234 --> 01:03:00.611
But she's strong as a woman
half her age.

01:03:00.695 --> 01:03:02.447
That's in my favor.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.032
Reads, too, by my good graces.

01:03:05.116 --> 01:03:07.618
Other masters wouldn't have it.

01:03:07.702 --> 01:03:11.372
Cooks, sews, handles the house.

01:03:11.456 --> 01:03:13.291
Understands a man's needs.

01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:17.837
- $2,000.
- You can't.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.963
[laughs]

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:20.882
You don't have half it.

01:03:20.965 --> 01:03:23.759
It's everything, but I have it.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:26.721
Make her free
to leave with me tomorrow,

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.514
and I'll give it to you.

01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:35.730
I think we can come
to some kind of agreement.

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:53.581
[humming Binta's lullaby]

01:04:03.966 --> 01:04:05.468
[humming stops]

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.513
Something you need, Massa?

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:15.144
Miss Patricia need something?

01:04:15.228 --> 01:04:19.023
She's sleeping.
Not that that matters.

01:04:20.274 --> 01:04:21.817
[sighs]

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:24.070
I'm making sweet rolls
for tomorrow.

01:04:24.153 --> 01:04:27.156
Ah. Tomorrow.

01:04:31.494 --> 01:04:33.371
Way of saying goodbye?

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:38.626
Tell me you want to go.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:41.003
He gonna pay you well.

01:04:41.087 --> 01:04:44.840
You expect me to sell you to that nigger
bastard who looks down on me?

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:47.009
Pick that nigger over me?!

01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:49.554
Over George?!
[glass shatters]

01:04:49.637 --> 01:04:52.181
You have a place here
with people who love you,

01:04:52.265 --> 01:04:54.684
and you just want to go
somewheres else.

01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:58.062
Please!
Please, Massa! Don't.

01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:02.900
You ain't never been beat.
I don't overwork you.

01:05:02.984 --> 01:05:05.987
I have more right
than that free nigger!

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:10.616
You've been bragging to George
about how you gonna be leaving me.

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.451
I ain't been bragging.

01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:15.079
You just expect me
to let you go?

01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:18.040
I can't go.

01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:19.667
Ungrateful.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.545
You think
I'm just gonna let you go?

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.088
I can't go.

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:25.798
Ungrateful.

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:27.425
I ain't leaving!
I ain't leaving!

01:05:27.508 --> 01:05:30.219
You think I'd leave
my family here with you?

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:35.891
And the time they start having babies,
I'd be a thousand miles gone.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:39.937
And I see you still they massa?

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:43.107
I'd die every day.

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:47.194
But when George and Matilda
have children,

01:05:47.278 --> 01:05:52.575
if you ever touch just one,
I'll kill you.

01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:55.953
And I'll hang for it gladly.

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:01.626
Now, now, Kizzy.

01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:05.254
They're gonna be
my grandchildren, too.

01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:17.308
Now be quick about it.

01:06:51.342 --> 01:06:52.593
[sobbing]

01:07:19.787 --> 01:07:23.874
If you won't come with me,
take this.

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:26.794
Day might come when you're
able to buy yourself free.

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:30.673
I can't.

01:07:30.756 --> 01:07:33.134
You start a new life.

01:07:33.217 --> 01:07:37.304
Keep traveling north
and find some...

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:42.768
Find somebody else.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:00.161
[Kizzy sighs]

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:14.759
My daddy would have liked you.

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:32.526
Marcellus: Get up, now.

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.227
[sobs]

01:09:13.943 --> 01:09:16.362
- Give me that.
- Don't need no help.

01:09:18.322 --> 01:09:21.450
You sure Massa say
I should come?

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:25.662
Long ride, lots to do.

01:09:25.746 --> 01:09:27.706
Greensville County in Virginia.

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:31.710
A thousand men come for this match.
Six tents. We taking 20 birds.

01:09:31.794 --> 01:09:33.045
20?

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:36.048
Told Massa he want that many,
he can't do it without Mingo.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:38.259
Clear as day to those got eyes.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:41.970
To watch the cages.

01:09:42.054 --> 01:09:45.015
Tend the birds.

01:09:45.099 --> 01:09:46.433
Oh.

01:09:48.477 --> 01:09:49.937
You got my feed?

01:09:57.987 --> 01:09:59.864
Just like I told you, boy.

01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:01.866
Birds leave they marks
on a man.

01:10:01.949 --> 01:10:05.369
But still so pretty,
women cry when I pass by.

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:08.122
[chuckles]
You're still a slave, too.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:09.456
That may be.

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.293
I've been saving up.
Got me a scheme.

01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:15.045
- Scheme? Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:15.129 --> 01:10:18.257
I'm gonna buy Matilda,
then all my babies free.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.051
Man saving up money
got to pinch every penny.

01:10:21.135 --> 01:10:24.054
Damn hard scheme
for the likes of you.

01:10:24.138 --> 01:10:27.683
You toss away money
like you feeding it to the hens.

01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:29.268
[rooster clucking]

01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:31.937
All your bragging
and carrying on,

01:10:32.021 --> 01:10:35.232
I know how much time
you spend with my birds.

01:10:35.316 --> 01:10:37.401
Folks say birds are stupid.

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:41.030
Birds know who they can trust,
know who love them.

01:10:42.072 --> 01:10:46.452
Folks is mostly fools
when it come to knowing that.

01:10:46.535 --> 01:10:51.123
Birds know a man by his touch,
by the sweat.

01:10:57.922 --> 01:11:00.507
You a better bird man than me.

01:11:03.052 --> 01:11:05.930
Only 'cause I had the best damn
teacher in Carolina.

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:10.100
You damn right you did.

01:11:15.814 --> 01:11:17.066
[gunshot]

01:11:18.859 --> 01:11:21.487
- Hyah! Hyah!
- [gunshot]

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:23.489
Man: The Prophet's coming!

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:25.115
The Prophet's coming!

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:27.034
He's on his way!

01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:29.411
River of blood is what's
speeding him on his way!

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:30.746
Whoa, you! Hup!

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:32.831
Man: Got plenty of ammunition.

01:11:32.915 --> 01:11:35.376
[dogs barking]

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:36.919
Everybody carrying guns.

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:38.545
Lea: Damn.
What the hell is this?

01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:40.255
Where's everybody going?

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:42.275
Never heard of canceling
no match, rain or shine, Massa.

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:45.344
[gunshot in distance]
[horse neighs]

01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:46.971
I don't think we should stay,
Massa.

01:11:47.054 --> 01:11:48.555
We just drove four days
to Virginia.

01:11:48.639 --> 01:11:49.932
Pretty penny
out of pocket, too.

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:52.768
I need an explanation, or someone's gonna
pay me for my trouble.

01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:55.229
Savages!
That's all they are, is savages!

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:56.647
What's going on here?

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.816
Nigger from Sam Turner's farm
named Nat

01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:00.859
running loose
with hundreds of other niggers.

01:12:00.943 --> 01:12:02.194
I hear thousands.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:05.364
Killing men, women, children,
any white folks they come upon.

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:07.783
Whole families dead.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:12.079
Babies in their beds,
using axes, swords, clubs.

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:14.665
They beat Margaret Whitehead
to death with a fence post.

01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:17.251
Reading the Bible
over their bloody bodies,

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:19.670
calling himself the Prophet.

01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:21.964
He ain't just killing.
He's a cannibal.

01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:25.426
Burning up little babies,
serving them to his gang to eat.

01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:26.760
Why ain't nobody find him yet?

01:12:26.844 --> 01:12:28.804
Other slaves hiding
these killers on farms,

01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:31.682
in barns, cabins...
right under our noses.

01:12:31.765 --> 01:12:34.518
I'm warning you boys...
murder's spreading everywhere!

01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:37.771
I'm six days from home,
and I got five little ones.

01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:43.318
God! I'll kill any nigger
that gets in my way!

01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:45.237
[rooster clucking]

01:12:45.362 --> 01:12:47.156
Hey!
What y'all doing?

01:12:47.239 --> 01:12:49.408
Don't hurt my birds.
Don't hurt my birds.

01:12:49.491 --> 01:12:51.744
You got any guns and knives
in this wagon?

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:55.164
Get away
from Massa Lea's birds.

01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:57.291
Mingo! Mingo!

01:12:57.374 --> 01:12:58.542
Hey, boy!

01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:00.044
No, please!
Please, Massa!

01:13:00.127 --> 01:13:01.253
Please!

01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:04.298
He a good ol' boy.
Good ol' boy, no problem.

01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:06.383
- We with Massa Tom...
- Hey!

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.471
These yours?

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:12.056
Yeah.

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:16.310
You vouch for them?

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:18.520
Came with me to fight birds.

01:13:18.604 --> 01:13:22.608
Can't find
that devil's Prophet.

01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:24.651
Niggers.

01:13:24.735 --> 01:13:28.447
Hiding guns and knives
any place they can.

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.991
I don't care how long you own
them sons of bitches.

01:13:31.075 --> 01:13:33.327
I wouldn't trust no one.

01:13:39.041 --> 01:13:42.419
We need a doctor
for Mingo, Massa.

01:13:46.548 --> 01:13:49.009
We need to go home now.
Patricia's by herself.

01:13:49.093 --> 01:13:51.220
Mama there for Miss Patricia.
She be fine.

01:13:51.303 --> 01:13:53.430
You take us home. Now!

01:13:53.514 --> 01:13:55.724
Yes, Massa.
Yes, Massa.

01:13:55.808 --> 01:13:57.768
Now, come on.
I got you.

01:13:57.851 --> 01:14:00.354
You strong.
You fine, you hear me?

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:02.189
[grunts] You fine!

01:14:02.272 --> 01:14:03.565
Hurry up, George!

01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:05.442
Yes, Massa.
[grunts]

01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:07.903
Come on, let's go!

01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:09.905
That nigger Turner's
the devil on earth.

01:14:10.906 --> 01:14:14.118
Mingo's hurt real bad, Massa. We've been
riding like this for three days.

01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:16.120
You'd never think of rising up
with no slaves

01:14:16.203 --> 01:14:17.996
against me and Tricia,
would you, George?

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.124
No, Massa.
You know me.

01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:23.043
We got to find a doctor
somewhere.

01:14:23.127 --> 01:14:27.005
'Cause if you did, George,
I'd blow your goddamn head off.

01:14:27.089 --> 01:14:28.674
[horse neighs]

01:14:28.757 --> 01:14:30.050
Stop the wagon.

01:14:30.134 --> 01:14:33.720
- Ho! Ho!
- Hold up now. Hold up.

01:14:33.804 --> 01:14:36.932
- Where y'all coming from?
- Southampton.

01:14:37.015 --> 01:14:38.993
Trying to get home before
the Prophet reaches my farm.

01:14:39.017 --> 01:14:40.829
We got every man with a gun
out looking for him.

01:14:40.853 --> 01:14:42.104
Uh-huh.

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:45.691
This your boy?

01:14:47.401 --> 01:14:48.652
Yes, sir.

01:14:48.735 --> 01:14:52.322
Well, you a damn fool if you
ain't got him tied up good.

01:14:52.406 --> 01:14:53.949
That Nat Turner's a fever.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:56.076
You never know which nigger's
gonna catch it.

01:15:05.794 --> 01:15:07.379
Massa, what you doing?

01:15:10.299 --> 01:15:12.509
Chain yourself
to the wagon, George.

01:15:14.428 --> 01:15:16.263
Massa, it's me.

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:17.639
It's George.
You trust me.

01:15:17.723 --> 01:15:20.517
Do it, George,
or I will shoot you.

01:15:20.601 --> 01:15:22.811
Go on!

01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:47.377
Man: Let 'em through.

01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:53.050
You've known me
since I was a child.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.760
I can trust a child.

01:15:54.843 --> 01:15:57.221
It's when y'all get growed
is when you get ideas.

01:15:57.304 --> 01:15:59.765
God help you if anything's
happened to Tricia.

01:15:59.848 --> 01:16:01.558
Hyah!
[horse neighs]

01:16:03.435 --> 01:16:05.437
Hyah!

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:09.441
Hyah!

01:16:11.944 --> 01:16:13.278
Hyah!

01:16:13.362 --> 01:16:15.405
Ho!

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.286
What have you niggers done
to my farm?

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:23.622
[gunshot]

01:16:23.705 --> 01:16:24.957
Tricia!

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.291
[barking]

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:29.127
Don't you move, boy!
Stay in that wagon!

01:16:29.211 --> 01:16:30.796
Tricia!

01:16:30.879 --> 01:16:32.339
- Tom!
- Tom!

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:34.716
I come to make sure
Miss Patricia's all right.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.803
[crying]

01:16:37.886 --> 01:16:40.597
Dirty nigger.
Dirty bastards!

01:16:42.266 --> 01:16:43.558
Get inside, Tricia.

01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:45.560
Now! Go on!

01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:48.230
Man: Five militiamen came
over here looking for slaves.

01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:50.440
They set the cabins on fire.

01:16:50.524 --> 01:16:53.360
Thank God you're back.
I was so scared.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.449
Reverend Lyon,
what the hell you doing here?

01:16:59.533 --> 01:17:01.076
This ain't no place
to be right now.

01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:03.161
Heard some riders
was heading for the Lea farm,

01:17:03.245 --> 01:17:05.414
so I come over to check
on Matilda and the family.

01:17:05.497 --> 01:17:08.417
But them white boys came up
on... on the cabins so fast.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.168
I had to hide.

01:17:10.252 --> 01:17:13.130
They burned down
everything they could.

01:17:15.215 --> 01:17:18.593
[crying] I don't know
where Kizzy and Tilda are.

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:22.055
Guess I talk a lot,
but I can't help nobody.

01:17:22.139 --> 01:17:23.974
Look at me, look at me.

01:17:24.057 --> 01:17:26.518
Get me that ax.
Get me that ax.

01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:32.024
Get the wood.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:40.198
Gonna find Mama and Matilda.

01:17:40.282 --> 01:17:42.451
I need to find my children,
but I'll be back.

01:17:42.534 --> 01:17:44.953
You can watch Mingo
till I can find help, all right?

01:17:45.037 --> 01:17:47.039
- I'll stay with him.
- All right.

01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:52.002
Promise me you'll hold on,
all right?

01:17:52.085 --> 01:17:53.545
You strong like nobody else.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:57.049
Watch out for Massa Tom.

01:17:57.132 --> 01:18:00.677
He ain't never gonna see you
for who you truly is.

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:04.264
Hold on.
I'll be back.

01:18:07.684 --> 01:18:10.395
Take my secret feed.

01:18:10.479 --> 01:18:14.691
I got something for you...
for your scheme.

01:18:17.027 --> 01:18:19.529
All right.
All right.

01:18:30.624 --> 01:18:32.084
Patricia:
I see you, George!

01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:34.252
You ain't gonna slit my throat
while I sleep!

01:18:34.336 --> 01:18:35.670
I see you!

01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:38.090
Tilda!

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:43.387
Tilda!

01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:44.971
Matilda, it's me!

01:18:50.268 --> 01:18:52.145
Matilda, it's me!

01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:02.155
George: Tilda!

01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:05.742
Mama?

01:19:05.826 --> 01:19:08.412
Matilda!

01:19:08.495 --> 01:19:10.497
Mama!

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.333
Matilda, it's me, George!

01:19:28.557 --> 01:19:30.725
Oh, George.

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:35.439
[sighs] I thought you was dead.

01:19:43.905 --> 01:19:45.198
Come see the babies.

01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:51.997
[baby crying]

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.625
Matilda was scared to death
she was never gonna see you again.

01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:58.420
- Sister Sarah.
- George! Oh, child!

01:19:58.503 --> 01:20:00.464
- Thank God.
- Oh, God.

01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:03.758
Glad to see you.
Thank God!

01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:07.554
Tilda, come on out.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:09.806
Come on.

01:20:10.807 --> 01:20:11.892
George.
[whimpers]

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:13.560
- George! George!
- Tilda!

01:20:13.643 --> 01:20:14.895
[cries]

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:16.521
George.

01:20:16.605 --> 01:20:18.565
Oh, George.

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:24.112
Your mama the only reason
we're alive.

01:20:24.196 --> 01:20:27.073
She brought us out here,
been catching food for us, too.

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:30.160
Cabins was on fire.
I didn't know what happened to you.

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:31.953
We heard them
coming in the night.

01:20:32.037 --> 01:20:34.331
Me and Mama Kizzy went
to Miss Patricia with the babies,

01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:37.876
but she had locked everything up,
and we couldn't get in.

01:20:37.959 --> 01:20:40.712
Then the militiamen showed up,

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.797
set fire everywhere.

01:20:42.881 --> 01:20:46.885
Screaming about some man
named Turner and an uprising.

01:20:46.968 --> 01:20:49.346
They was hunting us, George.

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:52.182
We barely made it
out here to the woods.

01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:54.768
It's all right now.
It's all right now.

01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:57.145
- Where my babies?
- [baby crying]

01:20:59.439 --> 01:21:01.358
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:21:01.441 --> 01:21:03.109
I'm home now.

01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:21.086
He's gone.

01:21:24.339 --> 01:21:26.716
Never did talk about hisself.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.927
Just talked about them birds.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.931
I don't even know
where he was born.

01:21:33.014 --> 01:21:35.100
I don't know if he had
one damn person cry for him!

01:21:35.183 --> 01:21:36.601
He had you.

01:21:36.685 --> 01:21:39.396
- He had you.
- [crying]

01:21:39.479 --> 01:21:40.730
He had you.

01:21:40.814 --> 01:21:43.108
Let me go.
[sniffles]

01:21:46.903 --> 01:21:48.530
You need to be
with Matilda now.

01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:49.864
Son of a bitch!

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:51.908
Too goddamn good
to come down here.

01:21:51.992 --> 01:21:53.952
Mingo worked his life away
for him.

01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:56.371
That's what that bastard
want for all of them...

01:21:56.454 --> 01:21:58.832
- just work till we dead.
- George, no.

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:01.126
You gonna kill Massa Tom?

01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:03.086
That gonna make
anything better for us?

01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:05.398
You think I've been ignorant
about that man my whole life?

01:22:05.422 --> 01:22:07.549
Look at me!

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:10.093
You think I don't know
I'm his son?

01:22:10.176 --> 01:22:12.470
I've been drowning
that truth in my head

01:22:12.554 --> 01:22:15.307
'cause I want so bad for us
to be away from him.

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:18.727
And I... ain't never gonna be that.

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:20.520
We're all gonna be like Mingo.

01:22:20.604 --> 01:22:22.355
And I've been waiting
for the right moment

01:22:22.439 --> 01:22:25.567
to give him everything he gave us,
and right now I'm gonna kill him.

01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:26.901
No, you can't kill him.

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:29.988
'Cause then they gonna kill you,
and that would rip me apart.

01:22:30.071 --> 01:22:33.450
All I know is how to make
all this livable.

01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:35.493
And I can't do that no more.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:41.499
I almost took my life
when you was born.

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:43.335
And yours, too.

01:22:44.628 --> 01:22:47.714
For a while, I didn't know
how to feel nothing.

01:22:47.797 --> 01:22:51.009
Nothing but shame and sorrow.

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:54.262
And so far away
from my mama and daddy,

01:22:54.346 --> 01:22:56.723
but it would have been
a terrible sin

01:22:56.806 --> 01:22:59.225
against everything
my daddy taught me.

01:22:59.309 --> 01:23:04.981
It seemed like I could hear
his voice right here... stopping me.

01:23:06.316 --> 01:23:11.946
He came to me,
and I decided to live.

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:14.449
You a fine man, George.

01:23:15.492 --> 01:23:17.577
And I ain't told you enough.

01:23:17.661 --> 01:23:23.041
Maybe I was scared you got
too much of Massa's blood.

01:23:23.124 --> 01:23:26.503
But you have honored my father.

01:23:26.586 --> 01:23:31.800
You here to keep
this family going, to survive.

01:23:31.883 --> 01:23:35.887
He always said we fight
when we need,

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:38.973
but first, we got to survive.

01:23:39.057 --> 01:23:44.354
Tom Lea whole life
gonna be a waste.

01:23:44.437 --> 01:23:46.523
But not yours.

01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:49.651
What keeps me living.

01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:51.528
I love you.

01:23:51.611 --> 01:23:54.072
I love you too much.

01:23:54.155 --> 01:23:57.075
Stay with me.

01:23:57.158 --> 01:23:59.035
Please.

01:23:59.119 --> 01:24:01.955
Live.

01:24:03.665 --> 01:24:06.042
[Kizzy sobs]

01:24:20.682 --> 01:24:23.518
[chickens clucking]

01:24:28.314 --> 01:24:29.816
[rooster crows]

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:33.528
Oh, uh, Mingo wanted you to have
this bucket with his secret feed in it.

01:24:33.611 --> 01:24:36.281
- Hey, that's too heavy for you.
- Oh, shit.

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:48.877
[coins clinking]

01:24:56.593 --> 01:24:58.470
[clattering]

01:25:15.028 --> 01:25:18.782
[slaves singing indistinctly]

01:25:21.743 --> 01:25:24.370
[baby crying]

01:25:32.253 --> 01:25:34.714
Kizzy: George, you and Matilda
got two girls and two boys,

01:25:34.798 --> 01:25:36.424
and ain't none of them
named Tom yet.

01:25:36.508 --> 01:25:38.009
I ain't giving them
that man's name.

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:40.303
- Mama, you said...
- I know what I said,

01:25:40.386 --> 01:25:42.972
and I knew what he'd do
if you don't name that boy Tom.

01:25:43.056 --> 01:25:46.059
He'll ride him
the rest of his living days.

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:47.727
Do it, George.

01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:52.106
Name him Tom.

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:53.733
Tilda.

01:25:53.817 --> 01:25:55.777
Mourning dove,
you need to rest.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:26:00.240
And I want you to name him the way
Mama Kizzy says her daddy taught her,

01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:03.034
the way Kunta Kinte
would do it.

01:26:03.159 --> 01:26:07.247
I know I didn't pay it no mind
with all our other babies.

01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:10.250
It ain't the way
my daddy taught me.

01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:15.338
But I heard Mama Kizzy telling
the stories to the boys one night.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:19.425
Something passed through me,
George.

01:26:19.509 --> 01:26:22.428
I don't see how both ways...

01:26:22.512 --> 01:26:25.181
mine and Mama Kizzy's...
can't be true.

01:26:26.182 --> 01:26:30.603
And I believe it will protect
this baby and all of us.

01:26:34.816 --> 01:26:38.069
I don't know how.

01:26:42.407 --> 01:26:44.492
Moving too fast for me, Mama.

01:26:44.576 --> 01:26:46.828
I ain't hardly trying, George.

01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:50.456
Like I say,
them birds a soft kind of work.

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:57.338
Here.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.846
How you know
it's the right spot?

01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:06.890
I know.

01:27:16.107 --> 01:27:17.483
Look up, little one.

01:27:20.278 --> 01:27:23.531
That's the only thing
greater than yourself.

01:27:40.882 --> 01:27:42.800
Gonna be more money

01:27:42.884 --> 01:27:44.844
at that Charleston jamboree
than we ever seen,

01:27:44.928 --> 01:27:46.804
and I am gonna win it.

01:27:46.888 --> 01:27:49.891
And turn it to ash in a bonfire
of foolishness,

01:27:49.974 --> 01:27:51.351
the way you always do.

01:27:52.727 --> 01:27:55.188
Matilda.
After George leaves,

01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:56.951
get the children weaving
new grain baskets.

01:27:56.981 --> 01:27:58.983
Ashford and George Jr.
can start clearing out

01:27:59.067 --> 01:28:01.361
- that stand of walnut trees.
- Matilda: Yes, ma'am.

01:28:03.446 --> 01:28:04.906
How we looking, George?

01:28:04.989 --> 01:28:07.325
George:
We got 10 strong killers,

01:28:07.408 --> 01:28:08.769
five young stags hungry for blood.

01:28:08.785 --> 01:28:12.664
I say we be fine,
long as you listen to me.

01:28:12.747 --> 01:28:15.333
Can't ever talk to me
like that, George.

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:16.709
Goddamn.

01:28:16.793 --> 01:28:18.628
I swear I'll sell your ass
in New Orleans.

01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:22.006
And fight your own birds.

01:28:22.090 --> 01:28:23.508
Look, George,

01:28:23.591 --> 01:28:29.013
there's more money to be won in that
Charleston jamboree than we ever seen,

01:28:29.097 --> 01:28:30.390
and we got to win big.

01:28:30.473 --> 01:28:32.976
That's what we'll do.

01:28:33.059 --> 01:28:37.021
George, you and me
used to be best friends.

01:28:37.105 --> 01:28:39.107
Ever since Mingo died,

01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:42.485
I can barely get a word out of you.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.960
It's a long road to Charleston,
Massa Tom.

01:28:49.534 --> 01:28:52.245
I'm gonna go help our boys
in the field.

01:28:52.328 --> 01:28:56.332
I'll bring back gifts
for everybody, my mourning dove.

01:28:56.416 --> 01:28:59.460
Just bring yourself home safe.

01:29:07.802 --> 01:29:10.054
Hey, hey, hey.

01:29:10.138 --> 01:29:12.306
You ain't never been gone
this long before, George.

01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:16.519
Well, got you
to watch over everybody.

01:29:16.602 --> 01:29:18.229
Ain't got no worries.

01:29:21.357 --> 01:29:23.901
And my daddy
gonna watch over you.

01:29:23.985 --> 01:29:26.112
Charleston's a long ways away.

01:29:31.909 --> 01:29:34.579
Yes, Mama.
[kiss]

01:29:45.131 --> 01:29:46.382
Hyah!

01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:02.607
[string music playing]

01:30:10.406 --> 01:30:13.993
George. There's more money here
than I ever thought could be.

01:30:14.077 --> 01:30:15.328
Where we going, Massa?

01:30:15.411 --> 01:30:17.538
[clears throat]

01:30:17.622 --> 01:30:19.832
Here he is, Jewett.

01:30:19.916 --> 01:30:21.959
Oh, Chicken George.

01:30:22.043 --> 01:30:26.839
Meet my cousin from Hampshire,
Sir C. Eric Russell.

01:30:27.924 --> 01:30:30.301
Jewett tells me
you're a sovereign of avifauna.

01:30:30.426 --> 01:30:32.571
I look forward to testing
your prowess against my birds.

01:30:32.595 --> 01:30:34.347
Thank you, sir.

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:37.225
Tom Lea and I have wanted
to settle once and for all

01:30:37.308 --> 01:30:39.477
who's best in our noble sport.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.021
But it's gonna cost you
to find out.

01:30:42.105 --> 01:30:46.317
Mr. Lea, while I understand
your confidence about a bird or two,

01:30:46.442 --> 01:30:48.945
I did not get wealthy
by betting small.

01:30:49.028 --> 01:30:51.781
A man who bets
a mere thousand here or there

01:30:51.864 --> 01:30:55.034
is a man who won't risk enough
to take what he wants.

01:30:55.118 --> 01:30:58.204
Or perhaps Chicken George
is only a small-time fighter.

01:30:58.287 --> 01:31:01.791
Oh, you ain't never seen
a fighter like me before... sir.

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:03.292
$10,000.

01:31:04.961 --> 01:31:06.462
Plus side bets.

01:31:11.968 --> 01:31:14.595
- Accepted.
- [cheering]

01:31:14.679 --> 01:31:16.514
$10,000 it is.

01:31:16.597 --> 01:31:20.726
And, boys,
I'll be open to all offers.

01:31:26.649 --> 01:31:28.317
Gentlemen.

01:31:32.655 --> 01:31:35.116
- Feel good about the birds?
- Best I ever felt.

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:37.160
Today's the day, George.

01:31:37.243 --> 01:31:39.304
I'm gonna rise up above every man
who ever looked down on me.

01:31:39.328 --> 01:31:42.373
$10,000?
Massa, you ain't got that much.

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:44.578
Don't matter how much
I got if we win, do it, George?

01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:47.503
- Besides, my farm's worth half that much.
- No.

01:31:48.713 --> 01:31:50.673
Can't bet our home.

01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:53.092
Not where my family live.

01:31:59.015 --> 01:32:02.518
You win this for me,
and I'll set you free.

01:32:03.519 --> 01:32:06.230
I swear.

01:32:06.314 --> 01:32:07.732
Write it.

01:32:07.815 --> 01:32:11.444
Write that paper, right here.

01:32:11.527 --> 01:32:14.155
Be waiting for you
when you're done.

01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:21.412
This ain't no dream, George.
Wide awake as I ever been.

01:32:21.537 --> 01:32:25.958
We're gonna be rich,
just like I said.

01:32:33.132 --> 01:32:35.009
Who that Englishman
think he is?

01:32:35.092 --> 01:32:37.345
How dare he fight us?

01:32:38.346 --> 01:32:42.183
We faster, smarter,
stronger, prettier.

01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:45.353
Insult to be in the same pit
with you and me.

01:32:45.436 --> 01:32:47.730
Come on now, you little bastard.

01:32:47.813 --> 01:32:50.650
I gave you blood and sweat.

01:32:50.733 --> 01:32:53.653
Make George a free man today.

01:32:53.736 --> 01:32:56.072
[indistinct conversations]

01:32:58.574 --> 01:32:59.867
George.

01:33:06.999 --> 01:33:08.542
Announcer: Oyez! Oyez!

01:33:08.626 --> 01:33:11.879
Our final pair
of the Charleston Main!

01:33:11.963 --> 01:33:13.881
A heavy match of birds.

01:33:13.965 --> 01:33:15.841
Six pounds four,

01:33:15.925 --> 01:33:20.304
Sir C. Eric Russell
of Hampshire, England.

01:33:20.388 --> 01:33:24.517
And Tom Lea of Caswell County,
North Carolina.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.686
[cheers and applause]

01:33:26.769 --> 01:33:31.774
Gentlemen, face your birds!

01:33:31.857 --> 01:33:33.526
Come on now, George!

01:33:36.654 --> 01:33:38.698
[roosters squawking]

01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:42.201
Rile 'em up.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.455
Step out.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.505
- Ready!
- Lea: Come on now, George.

01:33:56.674 --> 01:33:58.050
Pit your cocks!

01:34:03.097 --> 01:34:04.348
- Kill him!
- Fight him!

01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:09.061
Come on now!

01:34:09.145 --> 01:34:11.314
Come down on him!

01:34:13.774 --> 01:34:15.026
Come on, George.

01:34:21.407 --> 01:34:22.825
Come on!
Get him, boy!

01:34:31.667 --> 01:34:33.294
Come on now, Red!
Come on, Red!

01:34:40.593 --> 01:34:42.033
Announcer:
The match goes to Tom Lea!

01:34:42.053 --> 01:34:43.054
Yes!

01:34:43.137 --> 01:34:45.181
Yeah!

01:34:45.264 --> 01:34:47.016
Whoo!

01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:49.852
Yeah, boys!

01:34:49.935 --> 01:34:52.271
[cheering]

01:35:02.948 --> 01:35:04.283
Thanks, boys.

01:35:25.805 --> 01:35:27.807
[man vocalizing]

01:35:36.232 --> 01:35:38.234
I'm free.

01:35:40.528 --> 01:35:42.530
[laughs]

01:35:43.656 --> 01:35:44.907
I'm free!

01:35:47.368 --> 01:35:50.454
I'm free!
[laughs]

01:35:56.961 --> 01:35:58.587
Now you can get the cock out.

01:36:06.679 --> 01:36:07.721
[Tom laughs]

01:36:07.805 --> 01:36:10.349
Come on. Get in it.
Get in, boys.

01:36:10.433 --> 01:36:11.851
Glad y'all made money.

01:36:14.353 --> 01:36:16.939
I know you can read it, George.

01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:19.733
Know Kizzy been teaching you.

01:36:19.817 --> 01:36:21.944
It looks fine.

01:36:22.027 --> 01:36:23.946
[laughs] It look real fine.

01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:26.157
Sir Eric:
Your man has a rare skill.

01:36:28.409 --> 01:36:29.785
Plain to see.

01:36:29.869 --> 01:36:31.871
And yet, why do I feel
like a marionette,

01:36:31.954 --> 01:36:34.748
my strings pulled
by a clever manipulator?

01:36:34.832 --> 01:36:36.667
Did you set me up,
Mr. Lea?

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:39.712
- [George chuckles]
- You challenged me.

01:36:39.795 --> 01:36:44.133
I had the courage to take it,
and I had the man to win it.

01:36:44.216 --> 01:36:45.468
Then I assume your courage

01:36:45.551 --> 01:36:48.304
will permit me an opportunity
to recoup my losses,

01:36:48.387 --> 01:36:49.763
penny for penny.

01:36:49.847 --> 01:36:52.433
Well, even an Irishman
understands fair play.

01:36:52.516 --> 01:36:55.019
Sir Eric is willing to wager
another $10,000.

01:36:55.102 --> 01:36:56.520
[crowd murmurs]

01:36:59.398 --> 01:37:01.817
Can your damn English cousin
handle $20,000?

01:37:01.901 --> 01:37:03.527
[crowd murmurs]

01:37:06.947 --> 01:37:08.741
I relish the opportunity.

01:37:08.824 --> 01:37:11.035
- Done.
- [cheering]

01:37:15.039 --> 01:37:16.874
Come with me, cousin.

01:37:16.957 --> 01:37:19.919
I have something
I want to show you.

01:37:20.002 --> 01:37:22.046
Here you are, sir.

01:37:24.381 --> 01:37:26.926
His line has fought for kings.

01:37:27.009 --> 01:37:29.345
He'll have no trouble
with an Irishman and a nigger.

01:37:29.428 --> 01:37:31.639
[rooster squawks]

01:37:31.722 --> 01:37:33.724
[indistinct chatter and cheers]

01:37:39.897 --> 01:37:42.316
My money's on you.
My money's on you.

01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:43.734
You can do it.
Do it, George.

01:37:43.859 --> 01:37:45.402
Announcer:
Come on, clear the ring!

01:37:57.414 --> 01:38:00.876
- Man: Look at the size of that!
- Man 2: That's a big cock.

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:05.214
Look at the bird.
He's looking well.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.302
Oyez! Oyez!

01:38:10.386 --> 01:38:12.513
A private hack between Tom Lea

01:38:12.596 --> 01:38:15.266
of Caswell County,
North Carolina...

01:38:15.349 --> 01:38:17.226
[applause]

01:38:17.309 --> 01:38:20.688
...and Sir C. Eric Russell
of Hampshire, England.

01:38:20.771 --> 01:38:22.606
[applause]

01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:25.234
Gentlemen, face your birds!

01:38:25.317 --> 01:38:28.654
[cheering]

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:30.739
[roosters squawking]

01:38:30.823 --> 01:38:32.074
That's it, George.

01:38:32.157 --> 01:38:34.451
Step out!

01:38:34.535 --> 01:38:37.746
Man: Oh, he smells blood,
Chicken George! I know it!

01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.416
Man 2:
Let's go, Chicken George!

01:38:40.499 --> 01:38:42.501
Gentlemen...

01:38:44.587 --> 01:38:45.963
pit your cocks!

01:38:46.046 --> 01:38:49.008
Come on!
Come on, now!

01:38:58.934 --> 01:39:00.269
Damn it!

01:39:03.063 --> 01:39:05.524
Man: That's it! That's it!
Just like that!

01:39:05.608 --> 01:39:06.984
Come on, boy!

01:39:07.067 --> 01:39:10.279
Down! Down! Down!
Come down hard on him!

01:39:12.448 --> 01:39:13.699
[rooster crows]

01:39:16.827 --> 01:39:18.829
[rooster squawks]

01:39:18.954 --> 01:39:20.831
Come on, George!

01:39:20.956 --> 01:39:22.166
Come on!

01:39:23.792 --> 01:39:25.044
Come on.

01:39:29.006 --> 01:39:30.257
Shit!

01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:36.388
Finish him!

01:39:43.646 --> 01:39:46.607
Announcer:
Match to Sir C. Eric Russell!

01:40:26.355 --> 01:40:27.606
George.

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.902
I don't know what happened.
We need to set up another fight.

01:40:32.027 --> 01:40:36.365
They gamed us, George,
like fish at the end of a line.

01:40:36.448 --> 01:40:40.035
I lost everything...

01:40:40.119 --> 01:40:42.663
every penny.

01:40:42.746 --> 01:40:48.168
Look, George, the farm
ain't gonna cover my bets.

01:40:48.252 --> 01:40:52.089
Ain't even gonna cover
what I borrowed against it.

01:40:52.172 --> 01:40:53.716
I'm ruined,

01:40:53.799 --> 01:40:58.137
but that English bastard's
offering me a way out.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:59.471
[sighs]

01:40:59.555 --> 01:41:02.224
Said he never saw a man with
a touch for the birds like you.

01:41:02.307 --> 01:41:05.769
Said you was a magician.
Used that very word.

01:41:05.853 --> 01:41:07.896
What you saying?

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.859
[sighs] Not to drag it out,

01:41:11.942 --> 01:41:14.445
that Englishman will call me
even if I give you to him...

01:41:14.528 --> 01:41:16.280
take back to England.

01:41:16.363 --> 01:41:18.323
- England?!
- Mm-hmm.

01:41:18.407 --> 01:41:20.701
Now you ain't making no sense.

01:41:20.784 --> 01:41:23.036
Train his birds
and his handlers.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.914
I don't understand
the hell you saying to me.

01:41:25.998 --> 01:41:28.125
I'm free!
That's what we agreed.

01:41:28.208 --> 01:41:29.877
Money was in my hand, George.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.421
What's worse than being rich
for one day?

01:41:32.504 --> 01:41:34.339
You can't tell me
to leave my family!

01:41:34.423 --> 01:41:36.592
I ain't going nowhere for you,
you understand me?!

01:41:36.675 --> 01:41:40.471
I'm sorry, George.
I ain't got no other way to survive.

01:41:40.554 --> 01:41:42.389
The time will pass
like a summer squall.

01:41:42.473 --> 01:41:45.350
No, you bastard.
I am a free man.

01:41:45.434 --> 01:41:47.853
You ain't free, George.

01:41:47.936 --> 01:41:50.230
Not unless I register
them papers with the county.

01:41:50.314 --> 01:41:53.609
Now I will tell you something.

01:41:53.692 --> 01:41:55.694
When you come back,

01:41:55.778 --> 01:41:58.530
I'll have papers for your whole family
waiting in a lockbox.

01:41:58.614 --> 01:41:59.865
I'm not going!

01:41:59.948 --> 01:42:01.992
I'm tired of explaining it
to you!

01:42:02.117 --> 01:42:05.454
I don't have to give no damn
explanation to no damn slave!

01:42:05.537 --> 01:42:07.331
Sir Eric's carriage is leaving.

01:42:07.414 --> 01:42:09.458
Do not resist.
Do not waste his time.

01:42:09.541 --> 01:42:11.293
You can't do this!
You hear me?

01:42:11.376 --> 01:42:12.753
I earned it!
I'm free!

01:42:12.836 --> 01:42:14.838
You low bastard, Tom Lea!

01:42:14.922 --> 01:42:16.590
You ain't a man!

01:42:16.673 --> 01:42:19.510
You don't love nothing but money
and a whiskey jug!

01:42:19.593 --> 01:42:21.011
That's all you love!

01:42:21.136 --> 01:42:23.222
- Get this nigger off of me!
- Stop him!

01:42:25.599 --> 01:42:27.935
You really are the trash
everybody says you is!

01:42:28.018 --> 01:42:31.313
Ain't got no honor
and ain't got no pride!

01:42:31.396 --> 01:42:33.440
Not even say goodbye
to my family?!

01:42:33.524 --> 01:42:35.692
Matilda?!
My children and my mama?!

01:42:35.776 --> 01:42:38.654
You a lying dog, Tom Lea!

01:42:38.737 --> 01:42:42.616
Who gonna watch 'em, Tom?!
Who gonna watch my family?!

01:42:42.699 --> 01:42:44.409
Tom Lea!
[grunts]

01:42:53.585 --> 01:42:55.504
[coughing]

01:43:05.097 --> 01:43:06.598
[horse neighs]

01:43:36.461 --> 01:43:38.881
[screams]

01:43:47.097 --> 01:43:49.057
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:43:49.141 --> 01:43:50.851
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #
# Ah #

01:43:50.934 --> 01:43:54.271

# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:44:01.361 --> 01:44:03.071
# Had a heart full of hope #

01:44:03.155 --> 01:44:04.615
# I swallowed my pride #

01:44:04.698 --> 01:44:08.035
# Seeing everything
I had go away #

01:44:08.118 --> 01:44:10.037
# Praying for delivery now #

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.997
# Peace on my mind #

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.958
# Now let your grace rain on me #

01:44:15.959 --> 01:44:17.669
# What happened to my freedom? #

01:44:17.753 --> 01:44:19.046
# Separated my family #

01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:23.008
# Bringing to me this foreign place #

01:44:23.091 --> 01:44:25.010
# Now my hope is for surviving #

01:44:25.093 --> 01:44:26.637
# In the midst of evil #

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.097
# Things are never gonna be the same #

01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:31.975
# I wasn't born this way #

01:44:32.059 --> 01:44:35.145
# No, I wasn't born this way #

01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:38.148
# No, I wasn't born in vain #

01:44:38.273 --> 01:44:41.151
# Oh no #

01:44:41.276 --> 01:44:43.111
# Oh no #

01:44:43.195 --> 01:44:47.449
# Why do I feel so much shame? #
