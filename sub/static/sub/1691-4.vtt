WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:03.410
Works every... I'm
telling you, every time.

00:03.411 --> 00:05.452
- Do it, try it.
- What? Right now?

00:05.453 --> 00:08.491
All right, all right.

00:08.492 --> 00:10.518
Kind of... Kind of that.

00:10.519 --> 00:11.997
- Got to work on it, bro.
- All right, man.

00:11.998 --> 00:14.201
- Seriously.
- All right, bro, I'll work on it.

00:14.202 --> 00:17.296
But... just, like,
when... when do you know...

00:17.297 --> 00:18.759
Right before the cork pops, you know?

00:18.760 --> 00:20.214
Timing's important, but...

00:20.215 --> 00:22.049
But you don't do it, like... in her ear.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.918
- No, you don't do it in her ear.
- Because... yeah.

00:23.919 --> 00:25.804
It's a given you don't do it in her ear.

00:25.805 --> 00:28.140
But this is, like,
scientifically proven, okay?

00:28.141 --> 00:29.991
- Really?
- This is, like, prehistoric stuff.

00:29.992 --> 00:32.205
- Crazy, man.
- It's like the medulla, the wolf brain.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.613
- The what?
- It's primitive stuff...

00:33.614 --> 00:35.108
All right, let me try it again.

00:36.933 --> 00:38.133
Yeah!

00:38.877 --> 00:40.685
- Yeah? That's the wolf brain.
- Nice.

00:42.692 --> 00:45.663
Man, this town sucks!

00:45.900 --> 00:48.337
I'm sorry, bro. I know it's
yours and everything, but...

00:48.338 --> 00:52.089
- It's not even 2:00.
- Yeah, it does kind of suck.

00:52.383 --> 00:55.617
Hey, I know this
after-hours place over...

00:55.618 --> 00:58.053
A couple blocks off
Cermak. You want to hit it?

00:58.054 --> 01:01.894
Hells yeah! Let's do it.

01:03.392 --> 01:05.288
That's what I'm talking about.

01:09.949 --> 01:11.605
Okay.

01:14.197 --> 01:16.256
Not in her ear, right?

01:16.257 --> 01:18.638
Not in her ear, not in her ear. Hey...

01:18.639 --> 01:20.158
Bro, I never did catch your name.

01:20.159 --> 01:22.726
- Saul.
- Saul?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.766
"S'all good, man."

01:24.767 --> 01:26.031
Get it?

01:26.032 --> 01:28.669
I do... All right, Saul.

01:29.463 --> 01:31.350
Hey, hey, brother, whoa.

01:31.351 --> 01:33.693
Check it out. What is that?

01:35.742 --> 01:37.572
Holy shit.

01:38.544 --> 01:40.996
There's got to be at least a
thousand bucks in here, man.

01:40.997 --> 01:43.465
My God, look at that.

01:43.466 --> 01:45.634
- Whose is it?
- Mine.

01:45.635 --> 01:48.136
Hey, possession's like 4/10ths of the...

01:48.137 --> 01:50.138
What did you call it, bro?

01:50.139 --> 01:52.673
- Like, is there an ID or...
- Yeah.

01:54.677 --> 01:56.511
I don't know. Some fat guy.

02:02.769 --> 02:04.770
I'm thinking that one.

02:07.123 --> 02:09.130

Jesus. Is he...

02:25.208 --> 02:27.209
- What?
- Is he...

02:27.210 --> 02:28.476
I don't know.

02:44.410 --> 02:46.422
Hey.

02:46.423 --> 02:48.780
Hey, fella. You all right?

02:49.556 --> 02:52.546
â™ª -â™ª

02:52.952 --> 02:55.737
â™ª -â™ª

02:55.738 --> 02:57.706
- Hey, buddy. -
â™ª -â™ª

02:57.707 --> 02:59.291
Would you answer me?

02:59.292 --> 03:01.866
Hey, answer this, you butthole.

03:02.212 --> 03:04.033
- â™ª -â™ª
- What? Butt-hole?

03:04.034 --> 03:05.778
- What the hell?
- Hey...

03:05.779 --> 03:07.599
Hey, bro. Be nice, all right?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.619
This guy right here
is trying to help you.

03:10.295 --> 03:13.305
Help yourself to some
of this, you butthole.

03:13.306 --> 03:15.540
Hey, we're not butt-holes, all right?

03:15.541 --> 03:17.476
- So stop saying that.
- â™ª Butt, butthole â™ª

03:17.477 --> 03:20.946
â™ª butt, butt, butt-hole â™ª

03:20.947 --> 03:23.548
- Hey, man, what's your problem?
- â™ª butt, butt, butt â™ª

03:23.549 --> 03:27.152
My problem is I'm standing here
talking to a couple butt-holes.

03:27.153 --> 03:29.437
Actually, you're not
standing, you fat bastard.

03:29.438 --> 03:31.520
You're laying on your fat ass.

03:31.521 --> 03:33.575
Hey, I'll roundhouse-kick
you right in your head.

03:33.576 --> 03:35.177
And if you think I won't,

03:35.178 --> 03:38.021
I'll come to the McDonald's,
where you work and I'll buy...

03:38.022 --> 03:41.066
the whole damn place
and then I'll fire you.

03:41.067 --> 03:45.737
I'll say, "drop your mops, you
butt-holes, 'cause you're fired."

03:45.738 --> 03:51.410
And then I'll roundhouse-kick
you right in your stupid heads.

03:51.511 --> 03:55.847
Then I'll go "John"-Claude
Van Damme on you...

03:55.848 --> 04:00.111
S-s-s...
You butthole.

04:03.195 --> 04:04.615
I'm keeping the money.

04:04.616 --> 04:06.885
Here you go, fatty.

04:06.886 --> 04:09.693
I got dibs on that watch, man.

04:11.814 --> 04:13.246
Let me see that.

04:16.552 --> 04:18.375
What kind is it?

04:20.923 --> 04:23.184
I don't know. It's just a watch.

04:23.185 --> 04:25.227
- We got to get out of here, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:25.228 --> 04:26.896
What kind of watch is it?

04:26.897 --> 04:31.034
- It's... I don't know. It's...
- Well, then, let me look at it.

04:33.118 --> 04:36.011
- It's a damn Rolex.
- I don't know.

04:36.012 --> 04:37.422
Not cool to be greedy, bro.

04:37.423 --> 04:38.640
- I didn't know.
- Not cool.

04:38.641 --> 04:41.460
I didn't know what...

04:41.461 --> 04:42.894
So, how do you want to split this up?

04:42.895 --> 04:45.182
I'll tell you what... you keep the cash.

04:45.391 --> 04:48.456
- I'll just keep the watch.
- But it's worth like 3 grand, man.

04:48.457 --> 04:50.195
- $3,000 easy.
- No.

04:50.196 --> 04:51.546
Yeah.

04:51.547 --> 04:53.547
Hey, hey, hey.

04:53.548 --> 04:55.954
Come on, let's figure this
out. We gotta get out of here.

04:55.955 --> 04:57.769
All right, yeah. You're
right. You know what?

04:57.770 --> 05:00.242
I... sweeten the pot.

05:00.243 --> 05:04.252
I got, $5, $20, $40,
$60, $80... 580 bucks.

05:04.253 --> 05:06.661
Add that to the $1,000...
It's more than half.

05:06.662 --> 05:08.069
What do you know about that thing?

05:08.070 --> 05:09.871
I mean, is it worth more than $3,000?

05:09.872 --> 05:12.320
No, I don't... I don't
know. But we're good, right?

05:12.321 --> 05:13.809
Yeah? We good?

05:13.810 --> 05:15.831
- Okay?
- Well...

05:18.621 --> 05:21.621
Later, sucker!

05:39.344 --> 05:42.454
- Six left.
- Can we get more?

05:42.455 --> 05:43.788
God, I hope so.

05:43.789 --> 05:45.707
It's like a license to print money.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.375
A thing of beauty.

05:47.376 --> 05:51.212
Hey, what was that, crazy
stuff about roundhouse kicks?

05:51.213 --> 05:52.547
Where the hell did you get that?

05:52.548 --> 05:53.632
I don't know, man.

05:53.633 --> 05:54.966
Just something in my brain, you know?

05:54.967 --> 05:57.302
It just came out. Too much?

05:57.303 --> 05:58.803
No. I loved it.

05:58.804 --> 06:02.307
It was, like, deep or something.

06:03.476 --> 06:05.913
You want to talk about
brilliant? I mean we...

06:06.484 --> 06:08.748
You're the man, me... I'm just...

06:08.749 --> 06:10.910
I love watching you work, man.

06:13.586 --> 06:17.215
It's good for making beer
money. That's about all.

06:17.216 --> 06:20.684
<i>â™ª or you can smile â™ª</i>

06:20.685 --> 06:24.092
<i>â™ª That's all
right, my friend â™ª</i>

06:24.093 --> 06:25.245

Please, okay? No one has to know.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.205
I mean, you could just
pretend you didn't find us.

06:48.206 --> 06:50.541
We would never tell
anyone, would we, Craig?

06:50.542 --> 06:51.875
- No, absolutely not.
- No.

06:51.876 --> 06:54.211
I already called your lawyer.

06:54.212 --> 06:57.214
Besides, this little
family outing of yours...

06:57.215 --> 06:59.600
It's put an innocent man in jail.

06:59.601 --> 07:01.768
The cops are investigating
this as a kidnapping.

07:01.769 --> 07:05.105
They already rounded
up some poor suspect.

07:06.203 --> 07:10.444
A working-class guy. Father... I think.

07:10.445 --> 07:14.198
But anyway, you two... you
almost ruined someone's life.

07:14.199 --> 07:17.868
- Potentially several someones.
- I... we had no idea.

07:17.869 --> 07:20.154
Could this have been
the person in the van?

07:20.931 --> 07:25.008
What if the man they arrested
Is the one we were warned about?

07:25.009 --> 07:28.045
Yeah, maybe he's not so innocent?

07:28.046 --> 07:29.746
Warned? Warned how?

07:29.747 --> 07:33.584
Well, we had a phone call.
Someone disguising their voice.

07:33.585 --> 07:35.252
Yeah, they said someone
was coming for us.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.254
And there was a van outside the house...

07:37.255 --> 07:39.923
As if whoever was inside was watching us.

07:39.924 --> 07:42.259
And, once that drove off,

07:42.260 --> 07:46.136
- We... did what we did...
- For the kids.

07:46.137 --> 07:48.615
I wouldn't know about any of that.

07:48.616 --> 07:50.080
I just...

07:50.081 --> 07:53.320
I can assure you that you
and your family are safe.

07:53.321 --> 07:55.188
I mean, the police are
all over this thing, so...

07:55.189 --> 07:57.824
It... it doesn't matter.
We can't just go back.

07:57.825 --> 08:01.912
I mean, it's... our case.
They'll crucify Craig.

08:02.988 --> 08:05.032
Can't you just call Ms. Wexler again?

08:05.033 --> 08:07.417
You know, tell her you
didn't see us after all.

08:07.418 --> 08:10.387
If they think I ran away, it'll
look like I did something wrong.

08:10.388 --> 08:14.758
We can't risk losing everything
just because of some teensy mistake.

08:14.759 --> 08:16.794
- I mean, it's...
- Can I ask you something?

08:16.795 --> 08:18.795
What... what were you
hoping would happen?

08:18.796 --> 08:21.798
I mean, before I found you,
what were you planning to do?

08:23.018 --> 08:26.286
Well, we were in the process
of, you know, working that out...

08:26.287 --> 08:28.172
- We were working that out.
- When you, um...

08:28.173 --> 08:29.890
Yeah.

08:29.891 --> 08:31.097
All right, well...

08:31.098 --> 08:33.342
You still got a little bit
of maneuverability, all right?

08:33.344 --> 08:34.977
You... you're outdoorsy, right?

08:34.979 --> 08:37.114
So you went on an impromptu camping trip.

08:37.115 --> 08:40.193
I don't know. It's something
people do, apparently.

08:40.195 --> 08:44.598
You left the house a mess, and you
kicked in your own front door because...

08:44.599 --> 08:47.605
It's a free country.

08:47.606 --> 08:50.160
Kim Wexler is very good.
She'll make it work.

08:50.161 --> 08:52.645
Yeah, what... what about the money?

08:53.920 --> 08:58.920
Well, if she knows about it, she'll
tell, right? She'll have to tell.

08:59.156 --> 09:01.374
Well, like they say in Silicon Valley,

09:01.375 --> 09:03.779
"it's not a bug... it's a feature!"

09:04.142 --> 09:06.559
Did you ever hear of a bargaining chip?

09:06.560 --> 09:10.567
What we have right here is the
mother of all bargaining chips.

09:10.568 --> 09:15.221
Um, as in... You expect
us to give this back?

09:17.537 --> 09:19.977
We are not giving this back.

09:20.112 --> 09:23.359
We are not guilty. This
money belongs to us.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.384
We... well, I mean, Craig earned it.

09:25.385 --> 09:26.863
- I worked very hard...
- Yeah.

09:26.864 --> 09:30.893
- You know, weekends, holidays...
- Yep, all unpaid, always.

09:30.894 --> 09:32.836
And, really, just
because you're salaried,

09:32.837 --> 09:34.621
doesn't mean you don't deserve overtime.

09:34.622 --> 09:35.789
I think that's only fair.

09:35.790 --> 09:38.226
I mean, really, that's
what this is about, right?

09:38.227 --> 09:39.827
- Fairness.
- Fairness, right.

09:39.828 --> 09:41.445
I mean, not just what's legal.

09:41.446 --> 09:44.270
If you want to talk
about legal, slavery...

09:44.271 --> 09:49.271
That used to be legal.
Human slavery. So...

09:50.074 --> 09:52.965
Yeah, this is right up there with that.

10:01.757 --> 10:05.636
Please, just don't tell
anyone about the money.

10:06.337 --> 10:08.755
- I can't take a bribe.
- Who would know?

10:08.756 --> 10:10.556
- We won't tell anyone.
- Yeah, take it.

10:10.557 --> 10:11.642
I can't take it.

10:11.643 --> 10:14.478
Please, didn't you say
that you wanted to help us?

10:14.479 --> 10:17.352
So just pretend you never saw
the money. How hard is that?

10:17.835 --> 10:19.063
Take it.

10:19.469 --> 10:21.471
Take it.

10:21.472 --> 10:24.383
I can't... I can't take a bribe.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.911
But...

10:28.192 --> 10:32.008
You know what? I...
I can take a retainer.

10:32.588 --> 10:33.680
A retainer?

10:33.681 --> 10:37.734
Yeah, for my services... as your lawyer?

10:37.735 --> 10:41.321
- You're not our lawyer.
- Well, not yet.

10:41.322 --> 10:45.659
Look... I know that HHM
is shiny and it's slick.

10:45.660 --> 10:50.063
It's chock-full of lawyers and,
compared to them, I'm like a...

10:50.064 --> 10:52.933
A kiddy lemonade stand trying
to compete with Wal-Mart.

10:52.934 --> 10:55.018
But here's the thing...

10:55.019 --> 10:56.303
What are you gonna get from me

10:56.304 --> 10:58.672
That you're not gonna
get from those other guys?

10:58.673 --> 11:01.675
Passion, commitment.

11:01.676 --> 11:04.261
Ask yourself this... who found you?

11:04.262 --> 11:06.263
I don't see Howard Hamlin...

11:06.264 --> 11:09.330
ruining his $300 Gucci loafers out here.

11:09.331 --> 11:11.802
If you're with me, you're
my number-one client.

11:11.803 --> 11:14.471
Morning, noon, or night,
you call me... I'm there.

11:14.472 --> 11:17.807
I would be singularly devoted to you.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.493
But why not?

11:23.731 --> 11:26.628
I'm sorry. You're just...

11:28.975 --> 11:31.592
Just... I'm what?

11:32.155 --> 11:35.768
You're the kind of
lawyer guilty people hire.

12:07.191 --> 12:08.525
Did it make the paper?

12:09.334 --> 12:11.745
- What?
- Did it make the paper?

12:11.746 --> 12:13.780
Did what make the paper?

12:13.781 --> 12:16.082
Okay, well, probably missed the deadline,

12:16.083 --> 12:18.201
but check it out tomorrow
morning... front page.

12:18.202 --> 12:20.537
The Kettlemans, all four of them...

12:20.538 --> 12:21.705
Safe and sound.

12:21.706 --> 12:24.758
- Looks like you called it.
- Yeah.

12:24.759 --> 12:27.761
Camping... you know, pretty
much right in their own backyard.

12:27.762 --> 12:30.396
Well... Five miles above it.

12:30.397 --> 12:33.800
Jesus, the night I had. I
got pine nuts in my shoes.

12:33.801 --> 12:36.498
But, I mean, can you believe it?

12:37.605 --> 12:41.942
I-I guess you can.
It's just, you know...

12:41.943 --> 12:46.780
You assume that criminals are
gonna be smarter than they are.

12:46.781 --> 12:47.948
I don't know.

12:47.949 --> 12:50.950
It kind of breaks my heart a little.

12:55.270 --> 12:57.908
Not the loquacious sort, are you?

12:57.909 --> 13:01.193
We can't all be as blessed as you.

13:02.113 --> 13:05.499
- Well, thanks for your help.
- Don't mention it.

13:05.500 --> 13:09.334
And, if you ever need any assistance...

13:25.325 --> 13:27.938
Whoa, whoa. Why is my
client in handcuffs?

13:27.939 --> 13:30.607
This man is innocent. He's a victim.

13:30.608 --> 13:33.326
why... why on earth would he be cuffed?

13:33.327 --> 13:35.445
Just go... go ahead. Take
them off. There you go.

13:35.446 --> 13:36.446
Free at last!

13:36.447 --> 13:38.582
Hey, did he tell you the good news?

13:38.583 --> 13:40.750
Never even kidnapped... how about that?

13:40.751 --> 13:42.786
A family can't go on a little vacation

13:42.787 --> 13:44.671
without the whole city going on lockdown?

13:44.672 --> 13:47.541
By the way, where is your partner?
What? Did you lose the coin toss?

13:47.542 --> 13:50.677
Because we expect an apology
from him, as well as you.

13:50.678 --> 13:53.680
You really don't want to push
your luck with me, scumbag.

13:53.681 --> 13:57.684
You got eyes on you, asshole.
One little slip... just one.

13:57.685 --> 14:00.353
Yeah, well, you're... you're
both very pretty, so...

14:06.003 --> 14:07.804
Well...

14:07.805 --> 14:11.231
I believe I did more
than what you asked of me,

14:11.232 --> 14:15.902
so, that would make us square, yes?

14:15.903 --> 14:17.954
Great.

14:17.955 --> 14:19.956
You need a ride?

14:19.957 --> 14:22.792
Camping?

14:22.793 --> 14:24.628
You expect me to believe that shit?

14:24.629 --> 14:26.713
yeah, I know it.

14:26.714 --> 14:29.549
The things people do?

14:29.550 --> 14:30.717
They decide to go camping

14:30.718 --> 14:32.836
Right after I run my little offer by you?

14:32.837 --> 14:37.474
Could be argued that all of
life is one great coincidence.

14:41.312 --> 14:46.816
Somebody told those
people to, um, go camping.

14:46.817 --> 14:50.153
Somebody warned them.

14:50.154 --> 14:52.322
they're very woodsy.

14:52.323 --> 14:54.157
And between you and me,

14:54.158 --> 14:56.826
They're pretty rash when it
comes to the decision-making.

14:56.827 --> 14:59.663
I mean, they're not really
the plan-ahead types.

14:59.664 --> 15:02.332
Yeah, I'd cut the cute
attitude right about now

15:02.333 --> 15:03.833
If I were you.

15:03.834 --> 15:07.836
You ratted on me. There
will be consequences.

15:10.090 --> 15:12.125
Hey, if somebody warned the Kettlemans,

15:12.126 --> 15:14.930
it was probably somebody who
was worried about those kids.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.601
You know how much trouble you caused me?

15:21.602 --> 15:24.104
You didn't need any help
getting caught, okay?

15:24.105 --> 15:26.773
The neighbor ID'd you. You were sloppy.

15:26.774 --> 15:30.443
Any trouble you might
have... that's on you.

15:30.444 --> 15:33.446
Not to mention the blood in your van.

15:33.447 --> 15:37.450
Here's a thought... Ajax, formula 409!

15:37.451 --> 15:40.620
You have no idea the tap-dance
I had to give those cops

15:40.621 --> 15:41.705
To get you out of here.

15:41.706 --> 15:45.542
You gave them probable
cause out the wazoo.

15:45.543 --> 15:48.545
Now, and whoever the somebody is

15:48.546 --> 15:50.213
who may have warned the Kettlemans

15:50.214 --> 15:54.166
got them out of there before you
did anything even more stupid.

15:55.886 --> 15:59.689
You should be thanking
this good Samaritan.

15:59.690 --> 16:04.190
Because whoever he
is, he did you a favor.

17:00.701 --> 17:04.707
Okay, um, I'm thinking hourly here.

17:04.708 --> 17:07.131
There were some special
circumstances, so...

17:07.132 --> 17:11.132
Our elite-tier pricing would be...

17:11.604 --> 17:14.051
$950 an hour.

17:14.632 --> 17:17.467
round it off to 20 hours.

17:18.803 --> 17:21.087
$19,000...

17:21.453 --> 17:24.516
Plus $1,000 for travel expenses.

17:24.517 --> 17:27.926
Consulting fees... $1,500.

17:27.928 --> 17:32.732
And, research... Five for filing fees.

17:32.733 --> 17:34.760
I ate on the road.

17:36.113 --> 17:38.338
And storage fees.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.690
Miscellaneous expenses.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.434
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

17:58.884 --> 18:01.150
Double-breasted or single, sir?

18:01.151 --> 18:04.019
Single. Now, I want you to
cut the armholes high, okay?

18:04.020 --> 18:06.428
- Of course.
- And trim through the middle.

18:06.429 --> 18:08.908
- Trim.
- Cloth?

18:09.125 --> 18:11.927
Well, wool.

18:11.928 --> 18:13.554
Yeah.

18:15.882 --> 18:19.718
"Super 170 Tasmanian wool."

18:19.719 --> 18:22.387
- Beautiful choice, sir.
- Thanks.

18:22.388 --> 18:23.555
Navy, all right?

18:23.556 --> 18:25.758
Yeah. -

18:25.759 --> 18:27.893
That's it. Perfect. Pinstripe.

18:27.894 --> 18:29.895
Shall we discuss shirts?

18:29.896 --> 18:33.899
Okay, I'm gonna need your
finest sea island cotton

18:33.900 --> 18:36.235
with a white club
collar and french cuffs.

18:36.236 --> 18:37.903
I have the very thing.

18:37.904 --> 18:40.239
And I'm assuming you
want to see some ties?

18:40.240 --> 18:42.908
Yeah, I was, you know,
picturing something in a...

18:42.909 --> 18:45.310
- A light-blue
knit. -

18:45.311 --> 18:46.912
And, could you make sure

18:46.913 --> 18:50.249
Those are real mother-of-pearl
buttons on the shirts, okay?

18:50.250 --> 18:51.750
None of this fake plastic crap.

18:51.751 --> 18:54.253
Of course. I'll be right back.

18:54.254 --> 18:56.538
Some coffee, David, for the gentleman?

19:25.114 --> 19:27.125
Here we are.

19:29.755 --> 19:33.162
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.331
Yeah.

19:38.198 --> 19:40.631
So, um, what do you think?

19:42.468 --> 19:45.137
"Strawberry Fields Forever"?

19:45.138 --> 19:48.807
No. Are you crazy? It's not even close.

19:48.808 --> 19:50.893
- Yes, it is. Look.
- No, no.

19:50.894 --> 19:54.096
It's way more "Sassafras Glow". Way more.

19:54.097 --> 19:57.432
Use your eyes...
Strawberry Fields Forever.

19:57.433 --> 20:00.636
Ladies, back me up. Hey.
Is it... Sassafras Glow.

20:00.637 --> 20:02.104
- Am I right?
- No.

20:02.105 --> 20:05.741
Maybe "Rhapsody in
Blonde," but... Yeah, see?

20:05.742 --> 20:07.242
They agree with me.

20:07.243 --> 20:09.411
Whatever happened to "the
customer is always right"?

20:09.412 --> 20:11.747
Sassafras Glow... mix it up, all right?

20:11.748 --> 20:13.081
You're wrong. You'll see.

20:13.082 --> 20:14.917
Big deal. I'll wash
it out in the morning.

20:14.918 --> 20:17.252
- No biggie. Geez.
- It's bleach.

20:17.253 --> 20:20.167
- It doesn't wash out.
- What? It's permanent?

20:20.423 --> 20:23.494
We'll Photoshop the color, okay?

20:23.495 --> 20:25.577
Change of plan, ladies.

20:25.578 --> 20:29.181
I want to go with a simple
curling-iron job, okay?

20:29.182 --> 20:32.184
Give me, like, ringlets...

20:32.185 --> 20:35.687
You know, on top, like
Tony Curtis in "Spartacus."

20:35.688 --> 20:38.523
Yeah, like the bath scene in "Spartacus."

20:40.327 --> 20:41.793
- Okay.
- "I am Spartacus."

20:41.794 --> 20:44.464
Stop talking about it!

20:44.499 --> 20:45.697
Make me beautiful, already.

21:07.804 --> 21:09.271
<i>Hello.</i>

21:09.272 --> 21:12.641
<i>You've reached the law offices
of James M. McGill, esquire,</i>

21:12.642 --> 21:14.309
<i>A lawyer you can trust.</i>

21:14.310 --> 21:16.979
<i>Kindly leave your
information at the tone,</i>

21:16.980 --> 21:19.097
<i>And Mr. McGill will phone you promptly.</i>

21:20.099 --> 21:22.601
Hey. It's me.

21:22.602 --> 21:23.935
Hi.

21:23.936 --> 21:28.440
Anyway, "The Thing" is
playing downtown on Saturday.

21:28.441 --> 21:31.610
Thought you might be up for
some Kurt Russell action.

21:31.611 --> 21:34.446
I owe you one, so why don't
we just grab some dinner first?

21:34.447 --> 21:36.782
My treat.

21:36.783 --> 21:41.953
And... You know, if not, can
you give me a call anyway?

21:41.954 --> 21:43.288
I really want to talk to you.

21:43.289 --> 21:45.090
Okay. Bye.

21:45.091 --> 21:46.525
Come in.

21:46.526 --> 21:48.960
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

21:49.512 --> 21:51.263
How goes it?

21:51.264 --> 21:54.766
Tricky, for sure.

21:54.767 --> 21:57.769
Craig and Betsy really put us
in a corner with the police.

21:57.770 --> 21:59.104
Not to mention the press.

21:59.105 --> 22:02.590
But this camping story of theirs...

22:02.591 --> 22:05.019
They've been keeping
it consistent, at least.

22:05.954 --> 22:07.010
If it's okay with you,

22:07.011 --> 22:10.148
I think I should try to talk
them into hiring a PR firm.

22:10.149 --> 22:12.317
Certainly for the next couple of weeks.

22:15.004 --> 22:17.475
So, okay on the PR firm?

22:18.358 --> 22:21.836
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, of course. What's up?

22:21.837 --> 22:23.879
Take a ride with me.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.715
Okay. Where are we going?

22:52.342 --> 22:54.162
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

22:55.376 --> 22:56.980
Shit.

22:57.613 --> 22:59.451
Yep.

23:00.623 --> 23:05.465
That's... I mean, that's my suit, right?

23:05.466 --> 23:08.924
- Am I crazy here?
- No, you're not crazy.

23:08.925 --> 23:11.793
Look at the logo. That's our logo.

23:11.794 --> 23:14.296
He's just straight-up copying us.

23:14.297 --> 23:17.933
I mean, what the hell
is he thinking with this?

23:18.755 --> 23:21.410
I really... h-h-he's,
you know, a free spirit.

23:23.723 --> 23:25.541
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

23:28.089 --> 23:30.948
You two are still friends, right?

23:30.949 --> 23:33.181
- I wouldn't exactly...
- You talk, though.

23:33.182 --> 23:34.386
Not really...

23:34.387 --> 23:35.623
Still, you're the one he called

23:35.624 --> 23:38.427
when he found the Kettlemans
camped halfway up the Sandias.

23:39.455 --> 23:41.714
He was just looking out for
his own client... that's all.

23:41.715 --> 23:44.576
This isn't the third degree, Kim. I
really don't care one way or the other.

23:44.577 --> 23:47.059
I just...

23:49.916 --> 23:52.177
He's really forcing my hand here.

24:15.942 --> 24:17.609
Hey!

24:17.610 --> 24:19.034
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:19.035 --> 24:21.313
Am I interrupting?

24:21.314 --> 24:24.571
Not at all. Perfect timing. Come on.

24:26.385 --> 24:29.871
Sit. Have a massage, free of charge.

24:29.872 --> 24:32.513
- Okay.
- Got to try the foot bath, too.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.449
Yeah.

24:34.693 --> 24:36.915
Give the old dogs a rest.

24:44.637 --> 24:47.037
And go for the deep-tissue
setting. Otherwise...

24:47.038 --> 24:49.675
- Is that the small fist?
- Use the three arrows.

24:49.676 --> 24:51.492
- I did. I pressed it.
- Just... yeah.

24:51.493 --> 24:53.510
Now you feel it? Good.

24:53.980 --> 24:56.815
- Now relax, okay?
- Okay.

24:56.816 --> 24:58.619
You deserve a break today.

25:04.290 --> 25:07.526
- It's very nice.
- Told you.

25:07.527 --> 25:09.399
I get this free every night...

25:09.400 --> 25:11.470
Just one of the perks of salon living.

25:11.471 --> 25:15.544
The others being... Free
cucumber water, obviously.

25:15.545 --> 25:17.966
Obviously. Free mani-pedis?

25:18.471 --> 25:20.710
Deep discount mani-pedis.

25:20.711 --> 25:22.641
Because the ladies still
got to eat, you know?

25:22.642 --> 25:25.043
- Well, it's still a deal.
- Yeah.

25:26.613 --> 25:28.063
Living like a king, then.

25:45.248 --> 25:47.850
What's this? Is this a cease and desist?

25:47.851 --> 25:49.061
Yeah.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.200
Yeah. How pissed was he?

25:53.248 --> 25:55.484
Well, his head didn't actually explode,

25:55.485 --> 25:56.708
but, you know, pretty damn pissed,

25:56.709 --> 25:58.917
like "this won't end
well for you" pissed.

25:58.918 --> 26:00.193
Yeah.

26:00.194 --> 26:02.444
- How about that?
- Jimmy.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.783
- This is serious.
- I know.

26:04.784 --> 26:06.860
- Do you? I mean...
- Yeah.

26:06.861 --> 26:09.474
What the hell is with that billboard?

26:10.562 --> 26:12.975
I know you have a problem
with Hamlin, but I...

26:13.388 --> 26:15.193
I just don't get your angle here.

26:15.194 --> 26:18.029
Aren't you trying to build
your own law practice?

26:18.030 --> 26:21.866
Instead, you're spending
god knows how much money

26:21.867 --> 26:23.468
turning yourself into
a little Hamlin clone.

26:23.469 --> 26:26.871
I mean... Why are you
making this personal?

26:26.872 --> 26:29.883
It's not personal? It is so personal.

26:30.209 --> 26:33.378
It is completely and totally personal.

26:33.379 --> 26:35.213
- No, no, no. It's not. No.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

26:35.214 --> 26:38.216
Stop trying to pretend.

26:38.217 --> 26:40.552
I can advertise, can't I?

26:40.553 --> 26:41.803
What, do I have to clear everything

26:41.804 --> 26:43.054
past the great and powerful Howard?

26:43.055 --> 26:44.889
Yes, you can advertise,
Jimmy, all you want.

26:44.890 --> 26:48.226
That billboard is not advertising.
That is a declaration of war.

26:48.227 --> 26:49.561
Declaration of war? That's...

26:49.562 --> 26:52.564
It's right at Hamlin's exit. You
know he drives by it every day.

26:52.565 --> 26:54.899
It's business. I'm building a brand.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.901
You're ripping off a brand.

26:58.154 --> 26:59.988
There is nothing original in that ad.

26:59.989 --> 27:02.991
It certainly doesn't
represent Jimmy McGill.

27:02.992 --> 27:05.327
Hey, all right, now, he
fired the first shot, okay?

27:05.328 --> 27:08.853
Trying to keep me from using
my name, my own name, Kim?

27:09.511 --> 27:10.989
I get that.

27:11.667 --> 27:15.754
But this... You're better than this.

27:15.755 --> 27:16.788
- I'm better than this?
- Yeah.

27:16.789 --> 27:18.840
- I'm better than this?
- You are.

27:18.841 --> 27:21.259
Well, you're better
than that schmuck Hamlin!

27:21.260 --> 27:23.662
- Come on, Jimmy.
- You could work anywhere.

27:23.663 --> 27:26.264
You could be somewhere
where they appreciate you...

27:26.265 --> 27:28.117
You know, where they
see how valuable you are,

27:28.118 --> 27:30.801
where, I don't know,
maybe they care about you?

27:41.113 --> 27:43.648
Forget it, okay?

27:43.649 --> 27:46.651
If Hamlin wants to come
after me, he knows where I am.

27:46.652 --> 27:48.987
I'll be ready, guns blazing.

28:08.174 --> 28:11.342
The cease and desist
is just the beginning.

28:11.343 --> 28:14.846
The next step is an injunction.
You can't win this fight.

28:43.464 --> 28:46.447
Your honor, I'm a
humble solo practitioner,

28:46.448 --> 28:48.433
merely trying to ply my trade

28:48.434 --> 28:51.382
In an aggressive and
evolving marketplace.

28:51.383 --> 28:53.738
As I've argued repeatedly,
this is trademark infringement.

28:53.739 --> 28:57.432
Mr. McGill's new logo is
an absolute copy of ours.

28:57.684 --> 28:59.861
I think it falls firmly under fair use.

28:59.862 --> 29:01.195
Fair use?

29:01.196 --> 29:03.031
You're clearly profiting,
so fair use doesn't apply.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.700
It... there are only
so many fonts out there.

29:05.701 --> 29:07.869
Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?

29:07.870 --> 29:11.629
No, but we've been using this
particular font for 12 years now,

29:11.664 --> 29:14.208
and it, in concert with
our tri-rectangle graphic

29:14.209 --> 29:18.043
and Hamlindigo Blue, constitutes
a trademarked brand identifier.

29:18.044 --> 29:21.332
Whoa, whoa. Back up. Hamlindigo blue?

29:22.353 --> 29:24.812
Yes. That is our trademarked name.

29:24.813 --> 29:26.234
Holy crap.

29:26.235 --> 29:28.973
You seriously named a color "Hamlindigo"?

29:28.974 --> 29:31.309
That is... yikes.

29:31.310 --> 29:34.145
"Yikes"? From the man
dressed exactly like me.

29:34.146 --> 29:37.782
Your honor, I feel like I'm in the
mirror routine with Groucho Marx,

29:37.783 --> 29:40.118
Like we should be standing,
waving our arms at each other.

29:40.119 --> 29:42.120
Really? I don't see it.

29:42.121 --> 29:44.789
In addition, the name
McGill appears in both logos,

29:44.790 --> 29:46.624
which, I believe, Mr. McGill is hoping

29:46.625 --> 29:48.159
to further confuse potential clients.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.394
So I can't advertise
under my own name now?

29:50.395 --> 29:54.832
I'm to be penalized 'cause I happen to
share a name with one of HHM's partners?

29:54.833 --> 29:57.001
You can't take my name from me.

29:57.002 --> 29:59.337
The name is not the
problem here, Mr. McGill.

29:59.338 --> 30:02.006
Mr. Hamlin certainly seems to think so.

30:02.007 --> 30:05.343
I mean, he wants me to change
my name 'cause he claims that...

30:05.344 --> 30:07.948
That... what... it's some
kind of threat to his business?

30:07.949 --> 30:10.392
- Your honor.
- This is restraint of trade, okay?

30:10.393 --> 30:11.649
Whatever happened to the free market?

30:11.650 --> 30:15.510
- No, Hamlin here wants you to tell...
- Okay, okay, I've... enough.

30:15.511 --> 30:17.722
Mr. McGill, I've heard enough.

30:18.397 --> 30:20.158
All right, yes, you
are within your rights

30:20.159 --> 30:21.993
to advertise using your own name.

30:21.994 --> 30:25.830
However, in my estimation,
the billboard clearly

30:25.831 --> 30:28.166
and intentionally duplicates elements

30:28.167 --> 30:30.633
of the Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill logo.

30:30.634 --> 30:34.270
You're actively copying their
established brand for your own gain.

30:34.271 --> 30:36.330
I don't see any other
reasonable explanation.

30:36.331 --> 30:38.031
- Your honor, I...
- Jimmy, Jimmy.

30:38.032 --> 30:42.825
Wise up. The billboard must
come down within 48 hours.

30:44.655 --> 30:47.704
This is a classic
David vs. Goliath story.

30:47.705 --> 30:50.838
I mean, you got your gigantic law
firm Stomping all over the little guy.

30:50.839 --> 30:52.445
Can you hold the door?

30:52.446 --> 30:54.609
Yeah, but it's investigative
journalism at its best.

30:54.610 --> 30:56.712
I-it's right up your alley.

31:00.222 --> 31:02.900
Yeah, o-okay, well, let me
give you my cell just in case.

31:02.901 --> 31:06.237
Yeah. Thank you.

31:16.298 --> 31:18.299
Can I get the news desk, please?

31:18.300 --> 31:20.334
I got a hot tip.

31:20.335 --> 31:21.836
Don't you want to be the station
that brought down big law?

31:21.837 --> 31:23.838
You could be like the reporters
that brought down big tobacco.

31:23.839 --> 31:27.091
Look, I'm talking Woodward
and Bernstein here.

31:27.092 --> 31:31.729
<i>Hey, your exposé on predatory
ATM fees... that was... Wow!</i>

31:31.730 --> 31:33.314
Well, it's a miscarriage of justice,

31:33.315 --> 31:36.317
<i>And I think your viewers
would be very, very interested</i>

31:36.318 --> 31:40.488
And, grateful to you for
exposing this injustice.

31:40.489 --> 31:43.324
<i>I wouldn't characterize this
as a community health risk,</i>

31:43.325 --> 31:45.193
<i>But it's definitely in
the community interest.</i>

31:45.194 --> 31:49.697
No, yes, HHM is a pillar
of the community, yes.

31:49.698 --> 31:53.668
No, I... the war is an
important story, as well.

31:53.669 --> 31:55.536
That's why this action is so egregious.

31:55.537 --> 31:57.622
Sure. Okay.

31:57.623 --> 31:59.423
Well, at least consider the
human-interest angle here.

31:59.424 --> 32:01.759
Are you kidding?

32:01.760 --> 32:03.761
It's... lawyer pulls
himself up by his bootstraps,

32:03.762 --> 32:07.548
Only to be ground under the
heel of the old-money megafirm?

32:07.549 --> 32:11.719
That's hearts and minds! You... hello?

32:12.771 --> 32:15.389
Yeah, I have your number, too, so...

32:15.390 --> 32:16.774
Yeah, I see.

32:16.775 --> 32:18.582
Okay.

33:05.490 --> 33:06.991
No, no, no, no, no, no, man.

33:06.992 --> 33:08.192
Can't touch the goods.

33:08.193 --> 33:11.162
I signed the form... only
I can touch the camera.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.497
Fine, may I suggest you
widen the frame to include...

33:13.498 --> 33:15.533
The billboard is the story, okay?

33:15.534 --> 33:20.121
No, I'm also the story,
so... Got to get me in there.

33:20.122 --> 33:21.372
Okay, so, get on your mark.

33:21.373 --> 33:24.208
You know, no offense to
your minutes of experience,

33:24.209 --> 33:26.844
But I'd like to see what we
got before we do this, okay?

33:26.845 --> 33:28.581
Other guy.

33:29.530 --> 33:30.542
Other guy!

33:30.543 --> 33:33.434
Only other guy that's here,
go stand where I was standing.

33:33.435 --> 33:35.970
Shrink down. Shrink down.

33:35.971 --> 33:38.939
You know, scrunch. Yeah.

33:38.940 --> 33:42.360
Okay, widen the frame. Get the billboard.

33:42.361 --> 33:44.812
Okay, now get me. Me, me, me, me, me.

33:44.813 --> 33:49.867
No. Not me... get him.
He's me. Yeah, like that.

33:49.868 --> 33:51.652
Got it? Yeah.

33:51.653 --> 33:53.154
Good.

33:53.155 --> 33:56.991
Okay. Is he in the shot?

33:56.992 --> 33:58.659
No. Dude, just go.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.412
- How do I look?
- Great.

34:01.413 --> 34:04.248
I'll... no, this is my good side.

34:06.251 --> 34:07.968
Is... is the billboard in? Yes!

34:07.969 --> 34:10.971
Jesus, just... you said $100
for one hour, not freaking 3.

34:10.972 --> 34:12.840
You clearly have a journalistic impulse.

34:12.841 --> 34:14.558
You're a real go-getter, you know that?

34:14.559 --> 34:16.143
Go get this.

34:16.143 --> 34:18.679
All right, count me down.

34:18.679 --> 34:22.350
In 5, 4, 3...

34:22.351 --> 34:24.402
Gravitas.

34:24.402 --> 34:29.572
I'm James McGill.

34:29.574 --> 34:32.409
Like most Americans,
I'm a self-made man.

34:32.411 --> 34:35.079
I put myself through law school.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.581
Working in the courts
as a public defender,

34:37.581 --> 34:40.735
I represented those with
nowhere else to turn.

34:40.735 --> 34:43.670
I believe in service. It's
what I've built my career on.

34:43.672 --> 34:48.007
But I've also had a dream, a
dream that many of us have...

34:48.009 --> 34:52.346
A dream to own my own business.

34:52.347 --> 34:55.349
Well, I-i scrimped and
I saved, and finally,

34:55.350 --> 34:57.217
I was able to buy one billboard...

34:58.770 --> 35:03.274
A tiny foray into advertising
for my fledgling law firm.

35:03.275 --> 35:05.443
I've always been told

35:05.444 --> 35:07.278
That America is the land of opportunity,

35:07.279 --> 35:11.949
And I believed it... Until today.

35:13.146 --> 35:15.786
Not 24 hours after my billboard went up,

35:15.787 --> 35:17.938
a large law firm came after me.

35:17.939 --> 35:20.241
<i>They said that I was
hurting their business.</i>

35:20.242 --> 35:24.412
They're rich. They're
powerful. I'm just... One man.

35:24.413 --> 35:27.331
So, who do you think
the courts sided with?

35:28.834 --> 35:34.004
So now my little billboard comes down.

35:34.005 --> 35:35.339
Let me tell you something...

35:35.340 --> 35:37.675
If they want a fight,
they're gonna get a fight,

35:37.676 --> 35:40.227
Because I'm not giving up, not...

35:40.228 --> 35:43.063
Holy shit! Dude, the dude!

35:43.064 --> 35:44.815
- Help!
- Dude, the dude!

35:44.816 --> 35:47.401
- The worker guy!
- Holy shit.

35:47.402 --> 35:50.134
Please! Aah! Get me down!

35:50.135 --> 35:51.522
- Dude!
- Yeah, okay, call 911!

35:51.523 --> 35:53.374
- Help me!
- You got a cell?

35:53.375 --> 35:56.079
- Yeah, yeah.
- Please!

35:56.114 --> 35:59.919
Yeah, a guy just fell off a billboard
from frontage road south of mountain.

36:03.402 --> 36:05.018
Hey, man!

36:10.525 --> 36:12.592
Help me!

36:19.111 --> 36:20.986
Hey, man, I don't think that's very safe!

36:20.987 --> 36:22.806
You need to be, like, licensed for that!

36:22.841 --> 36:24.722
- Help me!
- Man...

36:30.637 --> 36:34.671
Not looking down. One rung at a time.

36:35.650 --> 36:37.483
Not looking down.

36:55.804 --> 36:57.805
Hurry up!

36:57.806 --> 36:59.974
Come get me!

37:00.495 --> 37:02.148
Help!

37:06.231 --> 37:09.682
Help me! Aah!

37:12.771 --> 37:15.621
- Sir, I'm right here!
- Please!

37:16.017 --> 37:17.246
Please!

37:23.164 --> 37:25.634
- Pull me up!
- Here, grab my hand!

37:25.635 --> 37:26.655
Pull me up!

37:33.793 --> 37:35.996
- Pull me up!
- Here!

37:36.637 --> 37:39.639
Aah!

38:05.875 --> 38:07.304
You okay?

38:07.439 --> 38:09.248
Took you long enough.

38:20.138 --> 38:21.472
<i>I was scared, yes.</i>

38:21.473 --> 38:24.273
<i>I mean, I'm not really
a big fan of heights...</i>

38:24.274 --> 38:25.342
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

38:25.343 --> 38:29.063
<i>But, you know, something inside
me said, "you have to do this."</i>

38:29.064 --> 38:31.331
<i>I'm sure our city's first responders</i>

38:31.332 --> 38:33.775
<i>would have been here momentarily.</i>

38:33.776 --> 38:36.015
<i>- Can you believe this guy?
- But at least I was able...</i>

38:36.016 --> 38:38.265
This whole thing was a
publicity stunt. It's got to be.

38:38.266 --> 38:40.741
<i>I think that's kind of all anybody
wants when they're in trouble.</i>

38:40.742 --> 38:42.009
<i>Of course I didn't think...</i>

38:42.010 --> 38:44.160
You don't think anyone's
gonna actually buy this?

38:45.477 --> 38:49.109
It's hard to say. People love a hero.

38:49.110 --> 38:50.367
<i>You take it as it comes, right?</i>

38:50.368 --> 38:53.504
<i>The universe put me in
that spot at that moment.</i>

38:53.505 --> 38:54.955
<i>Who am I to say no?</i>

38:54.956 --> 38:58.756
<i>You know, as a lawyer, while
I help people every day...</i>

38:58.757 --> 39:02.169
<i>- Whole thing's a damn stunt.
- But I think my clients know...</i>

39:02.170 --> 39:04.832
<i>that when they're in trouble, I'm there.</i>

39:04.833 --> 39:07.233
<i>I was just a guy who was in the right...</i>

39:38.449 --> 39:42.319
<i>You have seven new messages.</i>

39:44.614 --> 39:48.158
<i>To listen to your messages, press "1."</i>

39:49.269 --> 39:53.551
<i>First message, received at 5:40...</i>

40:21.626 --> 40:23.428
_

40:28.643 --> 40:31.678
It's just showmanship, Chuck.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.895
Yeah, right.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.183
You're early.

41:10.184 --> 41:12.462
- Did you...
- Yeah, I grounded myself.

41:12.463 --> 41:15.970
Hey, big day. My phone's
ringing off the hook.

41:15.971 --> 41:19.474
I have three consults
before lunchtime... three.

41:19.475 --> 41:22.160
- That's great, Jimmy.
- Yep.

41:22.898 --> 41:25.713
The worm has turned.

41:25.714 --> 41:27.116
That's really great.

41:27.117 --> 41:30.355
So, to what do you
credit this sudden change?

41:30.356 --> 41:33.023
Well, I got to admit... you were right.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.306
How so?

41:34.704 --> 41:37.760
Well, you told me to keep
plugging and, you know...

41:37.761 --> 41:39.818
do good work, and the clients will come.

41:39.819 --> 41:41.318
You know, I'll admit.

41:41.319 --> 41:46.295
I almost lost faith a couple
times, but the worm has turned.

41:49.811 --> 41:54.467
So, what... you've been getting
referrals from your PD clients?

41:54.468 --> 41:56.296
Yeah. You know...

41:56.431 --> 41:57.973
You work hard, show you got half a brain,

41:57.974 --> 42:00.142
and people come knocking, like you said.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.145
I just needed to get my face out there.

42:03.390 --> 42:06.514
So, prosecutors, then...
referring clients?

42:06.515 --> 42:09.673
Yeah. Yep. Exactly.

42:10.094 --> 42:11.511
Was it Bergeron?

42:11.512 --> 42:14.127
When I was starting out, she
sent me a couple good ones.

42:14.662 --> 42:16.867
Yeah, it was...

42:16.868 --> 42:19.871
- It was someone on her team.
- You know?

42:19.872 --> 42:23.539
I mean, hey, just took some
elbow grease and clean living...

42:23.540 --> 42:25.207
People noticed.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.929
I knew you had it in you.

42:30.847 --> 42:32.883
I don't see the journal here.

42:33.952 --> 42:36.765
- Right. Here you go.
- No, no, no.

42:36.766 --> 42:38.995
Albuquerque journal... it's not here.

42:39.888 --> 42:43.123
Yeah. I didn't see it outside.

42:43.124 --> 42:45.248
Wasn't out there? It's always out there.

42:45.249 --> 42:48.126
I didn't see it. Maybe
they forgot to deliver it.

42:48.127 --> 42:50.552
Maybe some kids grabbed it.

42:50.553 --> 42:53.567
Because if there's one thing kids
love, it's local print journalism.

42:53.568 --> 42:54.899
I don't know what to tell you.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.907
You got a ton of reading material there.

42:56.908 --> 43:00.604
Look, hey. Financial Times.

43:00.605 --> 43:04.053
You know, I know Albuquerque
is a hub of global intrigue,

43:04.054 --> 43:05.921
but you think that'll tide you over?

43:05.922 --> 43:07.579
All right, fine. But if
it's not here tomorrow,

43:07.580 --> 43:09.646
I'm gonna need you to call
the subscription office for me.

43:09.647 --> 43:12.047
Yeah, will do. Look, I got to go.

43:12.082 --> 43:15.044
- I don't want to be late.
- Hey, good luck today!

43:15.045 --> 43:16.940
- Thanks.
- Keep it up.

43:17.674 --> 43:19.540
Hard work looks good on you.

45:46.304 --> 45:47.905
