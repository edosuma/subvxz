WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:15.139
I'm thinking this planet's
not gonna work out as a base after all.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.104
Seeing that the key part
of secret base is the secret location,

00:21.188 --> 00:22.855
no, it will not work out.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.065
Where's Chopper?

00:25.442 --> 00:28.194
I signaled him.
He's either lost or ignoring us.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.988
He's not lost.

00:31.782 --> 00:32.782
Cross!

00:44.211 --> 00:46.003
Such a handsome face.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.965
I don't go for crazy anymore.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.467
That's all right, I prefer brains.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.241
Kanan!

01:16.827 --> 01:18.786
I got you! I got you!

01:35.387 --> 01:37.847
Ezra, I need you up here!

01:37.931 --> 01:39.515
Hold on. I'm busy at the moment.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.277
Up on three?

01:51.361 --> 01:52.445
Fine! One...

01:52.529 --> 01:53.488
Two...

01:53.572 --> 01:54.864
Three!

02:01.288 --> 02:02.872
I got us a ride. Come on!

02:04.750 --> 02:05.833
I don't like this.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.460
Just get ready to jump!

02:07.544 --> 02:08.586
Jump? You're crazy!

02:10.506 --> 02:11.506
Now!

02:22.601 --> 02:23.768
This was you?

02:23.852 --> 02:25.228
Yeah. Not bad.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.454
After you.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.539
Thanks for the lift.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.936
That was a close one.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.858
Yeah, another close one.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.527
What's wrong?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.115
Everywhere we go we run into
those guys, and I don't like it.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.869
lf this keeps up, we'll never be able to
help the rebels establish a base.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.620
At least not as long as we're with them.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.164
So, what are we gonna do about it?

03:27.249 --> 03:30.126
I don't know. But it's endangering
the whole squadron.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.754
We're gonna need advice on this.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.856
Well, you two seem fine.
How's The Phantom?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.401
I don't know. Chopper was flying.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.737
Oh, boy.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.655
So, kid, you find us a base yet?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.824
No, but we did find two Inquisitors.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.451
That's nothing new.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.620
She's waiting for you.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.873
Why did you have us meet you out here
away from the fleet?

04:10.292 --> 04:11.834
It's safer this way.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.669
Keeping your saber moving

04:13.754 --> 04:16.505
is key to deflecting the fire
of multiple adversaries.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.091
Fluid motion, one into the next,

04:19.176 --> 04:21.052
into the next, and so on.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.764
I've made some adjustments
to the classic Form IV techniques

04:24.848 --> 04:26.682
that I think you'll find
work well against droids

04:26.767 --> 04:28.184
and other ranged attackers.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.686
Here, I'll show you. One, two, three...

04:30.812 --> 04:32.188
He's amazing.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.441
I've watched these recordings
to help me with my own saber training.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.485
You should have seen him in person.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.530
Anakin Skywalker, he was my master.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.952
Kanan said he was the greatest warrior
the Jedi had in the Clone Wars.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.788
He was powerful, rarely lost a battle.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.249
What would have surprised people
was how kind he was.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.961
He cared deeply about his friends,

04:55.045 --> 04:56.963
and looked out for them until the end.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.131
Practice these exercises mindfully,

04:59.216 --> 05:01.801
and you'll see improvement, I promise.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.386
Do you know what happened to him?

05:05.722 --> 05:09.100
The last time I saw him, he was
rushing off to save the Chancellor.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.143
Then everything changed.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.438
The war ended and the Jedi
were accused of treason.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.316
One by one, they were hunted down.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.859
By the Inquisitors.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.111
Or worse.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.488
Speaking of Inquisitors...

05:22.572 --> 05:25.658
Ahsoka, what do you think about us
doing the hunting for a change?

05:25.742 --> 05:28.452
When you defeated one,
two more came.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.871
Who's to say we wouldn't
multiply our problems yet again?

05:30.956 --> 05:32.498
And there's Vader.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.583
I don't disagree. But the fact remains,

05:34.710 --> 05:37.378
we can't protect our friends
from Vader and his Inquisitors.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.754
I can barely protect you.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.589
I don't need protecting.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.426
It's times like these
that Anakin and I would turn to someone

05:43.510 --> 05:45.928
like Obi-Wan or Master Yoda.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.763
They always had the answer.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.182
Well, almost always.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.185
Then maybe we should
ask Master Yoda.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.151
So, where are they going now?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.366
Sometimes it's better not to know.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.979
Ezra, you're from Lothal?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.607
Yeah, this place is my home.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.410
Here it is. lf you and Kanan stand here,

06:51.495 --> 06:53.496
you can use the Force
to open the temple.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.247
I cannot.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.540
Why?

06:57.501 --> 06:59.418
Because I am no longer a Jedi.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.422
It was my choice, I left the Order.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.469
It's probably best if you two open it.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.555
All right then. Kanan?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.459
Hey, where's the door going?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.476
This is new.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.020
Well, new problem, new door.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.023
Chop, stay here. Keep an eye out.

08:40.103 --> 08:42.813
How did you contact Master Yoda here?

08:42.898 --> 08:45.983
Well, he kind of contacted us.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.236
I thought I was dreaming
when I first heard Master Yoda's voice.

08:49.613 --> 08:50.863
And I was meditating.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.407
Then perhaps
that's a good place to start.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.269
I see a doorway.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.063
Where? I don't see anything.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.481
Neither do I.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.194
Last time we spoke to Master Yoda,
we were separated.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.820
Maybe this is my path alone.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.240
Be careful!

09:34.324 --> 09:36.909
Don't worry. I wouldn't do
anything you would do.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.961
Where'd he go? He just disappeared.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.880
As you know,
these temples can be tricky.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.851
I wondered when you would return.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.937
A temple guard.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.981
I've come for knowledge.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.358
I need to know how to defeat
Vader and his Inquisitors.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.780
Try to fight, and you will fail.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.740
The Rebellion will be destroyed.

10:16.825 --> 10:17.950
You will die,

10:18.034 --> 10:20.828
and your apprentice
will become a servant of evil.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.371
What are you talking about?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.373
The dark side.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.584
It pulls at him, it calls to him.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.088
Eventually, he will be consumed by it.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.636
Stand aside.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.138
The boy must be eliminated

10:39.222 --> 10:41.181
before he embraces the darkness.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.310
I won't let that happen.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.074
They have fled.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.451
Your instincts have failed you.

11:42.786 --> 11:43.786
Have they?

11:43.870 --> 11:47.456
Our prey came here,
and they are still here.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.422
Tell me what you see.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.481
A Jedi temple.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.443
Their sanctuary will be their tomb.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.322
You knew Master Yoda?

12:20.782 --> 12:21.949
Yes.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.576
He taught almost all of the younglings
in the temple

12:24.661 --> 12:26.120
at one point or another.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.913
Kanan described him to me.

12:27.997 --> 12:32.334
Small, green, and wrinkly
with pointy ears.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.503
But he didn't know
what he was really like.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.839
I'm not sure anyone did.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.758
He was wise, kind,

12:39.843 --> 12:42.010
but when I was young,
he seemed happier.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.430
As the Clone War dragged on,

12:44.931 --> 12:48.267
he carried a great burden,
a deep sorrow,

12:49.018 --> 12:51.437
as if he knew before anyone else

12:51.521 --> 12:54.606
that one time was ending,
and another beginning.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.786
I know this place.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.706
Special to you it is?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.793
Master Yoda? You're here!

13:15.170 --> 13:17.421
Or here you are.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.340
Last time I couldn't see you.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.844
Growing your abilities are.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.055
And with them, danger.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.354
ls this the limit of your knowledge?

13:35.190 --> 13:36.607
I learned enough.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.067
I think not.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.214
You will never be strong enough
to protect your pupil,

14:00.298 --> 14:02.841
and you will perish for your failure.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.235
Ahsoka.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.246
Ahsoka, why did you leave?

14:36.501 --> 14:39.002
Where were you when I needed you?

14:39.087 --> 14:42.297
I made a choice. I couldn't stay.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.716
You were selfish.

14:45.510 --> 14:46.843
No!

14:48.429 --> 14:51.139
You abandoned me! You failed me!

14:51.933 --> 14:54.726
Do you know what I've become?

14:59.357 --> 15:00.649
No.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.068
No!

15:17.792 --> 15:20.460
Master Yoda, you're powerful.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.297
You must know a way to destroy
Vader and his Inquisitors.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.341
Padawan,

15:26.426 --> 15:29.469
thousands of Jedi once there were.

15:29.804 --> 15:32.097
Then came war.

15:32.307 --> 15:36.268
ln our arrogance,
join the conflict swiftly we did.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.021
Fear, anger, hate.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.526
Consumed by the dark side
the Jedi were.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.321
Was it wrong for the Jedi to fight?

15:47.405 --> 15:49.698
ls it wrong for me to protect my friends?

15:50.658 --> 15:51.950
Wrong?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.120
A long time, fought I did.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.497
Consumed by fear I was,

15:58.374 --> 16:00.042
though see it I did not.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.127
You were afraid?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.504
Yes, afraid.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.132
Surprised are you?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.135
A challenge lifelong it is,

16:10.219 --> 16:13.221
not to bend fear into anger.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.475
What's happening?

16:16.559 --> 16:19.269
Found you the enemy has.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.883
Even now, the servants of the dark side
come for your apprentice.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.427
You cannot fight forever.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.305
You're right.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.307
I can't protect Ezra forever.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.935
Not even from himself.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.104
All I can do is what I've done,

17:02.939 --> 17:04.439
train him the best I could.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.410
By the right of the Council,
by the will of the Force,

17:16.786 --> 17:20.122
Kanan Jarrus, you may rise.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.878
Wait, what does this mean?

17:29.340 --> 17:31.925
It means you are what I once was.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.136
A knight of the Jedi Order.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.475
The temple is falling. Go.
I will delay the enemy.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.161
There's still a way.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.586
Yeah, but Master Yoda, how are we
supposed to win if we don't fight back?

18:07.879 --> 18:09.045
Win?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.173
Win.

18:12.341 --> 18:16.052
How Jedi choose to win, the question is.

18:17.472 --> 18:20.557
We already chose. We're going to fight.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.397
Find Malachor.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.525
Malachor? Who's Malachor?

18:35.198 --> 18:37.949
Master Yoda? Master Yoda!

18:57.386 --> 18:59.679
The secrets of this temple will be ours.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.230
Kanan, Ahsoka,
you won't believe what I...

19:08.314 --> 19:09.981
Tell us later! Come on!

19:35.716 --> 19:37.259
Grand Inquisitor.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.151
Up ahead! The way out!

20:16.465 --> 20:17.632
Chopper!

20:23.764 --> 20:25.849
He says Imperial forces
are on their way.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.570
I saw Master Yoda.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.906
Saw him? What did he say?

20:41.407 --> 20:43.033
He said to find Malachor.

20:43.868 --> 20:44.993
Who's Malachor?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.080
Malachor isn't a person.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.999
It's a place.

21:12.313 --> 21:16.316
My master will be most pleased
with this discovery.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.526
Lord Vader.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.030
The Jedi are growing in their power.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.533
It will be their undoing.
