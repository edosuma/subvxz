KIDS: <i>Trick or treat!</i>

02:49.571 --> 02:51.187
Okay.
Thank you! Mahalo.

02:51.189 --> 02:52.822
What are you--
a dead butler?

02:52.824 --> 02:54.123
Zombie butler.

02:54.125 --> 02:56.876
Witchy-poo.
Happy Halloween.

02:56.878 --> 02:58.861
Scary kid.
Thanks.

02:58.863 --> 03:00.797
Your costume needs work.

03:00.799 --> 03:01.914
Do you want some candy?

03:01.916 --> 03:03.716
No, thanks.

03:17.514 --> 03:20.683
Catherine,
you can't keep doing this.

03:20.685 --> 03:23.102
You got to stop punishing
yourself for Billy's death.

03:24.221 --> 03:26.739
Steve, please don't
do this right now.

03:26.741 --> 03:29.192
No, would you please
just listen to me?

03:34.615 --> 03:36.115
I've been here.

03:36.117 --> 03:37.700
Okay? I promise you

03:37.702 --> 03:40.736
I've been exactly
where you are right now.

03:40.738 --> 03:43.005
When you lose
somebody like that,

03:43.007 --> 03:44.240
you start second-guessing
everything you did,

03:44.242 --> 03:45.591
you start thinking
about all the ways

03:45.593 --> 03:46.676
that it could've
been different.

03:46.678 --> 03:48.878
You got to stop, okay?

03:48.880 --> 03:52.131
I promise you, you do not want
to carry that weight.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.469
I'm not saying forget,
Catherine.

03:56.471 --> 03:57.470
I'm just saying

03:57.472 --> 03:59.755
you got to forgive
yourself a bit, and-and...

03:59.757 --> 04:02.058
give yourself
a chance to move on.

04:07.231 --> 04:08.614
I...

04:08.616 --> 04:10.900
I want to...

04:10.902 --> 04:13.119
I want to.

04:13.121 --> 04:14.821
I just don't know how.

04:14.823 --> 04:18.708
My whole life
was the Navy, Steve.

04:20.594 --> 04:24.247
Knowing where I had to be
every hour of every day.

04:24.249 --> 04:25.748
What I had to do.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.167
I had a purpose, and...

04:28.169 --> 04:29.669
that's all gone now, so...

04:29.671 --> 04:31.420
Right, that's why you got
to find something, okay?

04:31.422 --> 04:33.055
And it doesn't even have
to be a job.

04:33.057 --> 04:34.123
It doesn't matter what it is.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.424
But you got to find something.

04:37.144 --> 04:40.596
You putting your life on hold
is not gonna bring Billy back.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.236
Yeah.

04:51.108 --> 04:53.326
Yeah.

04:58.815 --> 05:00.983
Duke, how's Sergeant Chang?

05:00.985 --> 05:01.918
A little rattled.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.419
But better than
the other guy.

05:03.421 --> 05:04.704
(chuckles)
What do we know?

05:04.706 --> 05:06.322
Some lunatic went nuts

05:06.324 --> 05:07.740
and started
attacking people.

05:07.742 --> 05:08.991
Chang stepped in
to intervene,

05:08.993 --> 05:10.659
and the guy started
choking him.

05:10.661 --> 05:12.595
Took two shots
to the shoulder

05:12.597 --> 05:13.713
to put him down.

05:13.715 --> 05:14.964
Any indication
why the suspect

05:14.966 --> 05:16.999
wouldn't stand down?
Apparently he's

05:17.001 --> 05:18.267
unresponsive to
Chang's orders.

05:18.269 --> 05:19.668
Completely out of it.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.020
We're still
interviewing witnesses.

05:21.022 --> 05:22.805
Okay. Mahalo.

05:22.807 --> 05:24.307
All right, he's, uh...
he's down.

05:24.309 --> 05:26.776
(paramedics chatting
indistinctly)

05:26.778 --> 05:28.144
How are you guys?
All right?

05:28.146 --> 05:30.646
Yeah, a little shaken,
but we're okay.

05:30.648 --> 05:32.949
Max, I hope that costume
wasn't a rental.

05:32.951 --> 05:35.184
Fortunately it's
of my own design, Lieutenant.

05:35.186 --> 05:36.402
In keeping the tradition

05:36.404 --> 05:39.121
of Keanu-themed
Halloween costumes,

05:39.123 --> 05:41.690
I'm dressed as Siddhartha
from the brilliant

05:41.692 --> 05:44.860
but underrated
1993 film <i>Little Buddha.</i>

05:45.879 --> 05:47.296
That is a lot of blood.

05:47.298 --> 05:49.882
Yes, I don't think
he's gonna make it.

05:49.884 --> 05:53.035
That's provided
he was even alive to begin with.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.005
I'm sorry,
I'm pretty sure I have

05:56.007 --> 05:57.139
no idea what you're
talking about.

05:57.141 --> 05:58.540
I'm just saying the man showed

05:58.542 --> 06:00.643
all the classic signs
of zombiefication.

06:00.645 --> 06:02.211
He was unresponsive,

06:02.213 --> 06:03.396
had a labored gate.

06:03.398 --> 06:04.814
And he lashed out violently

06:04.816 --> 06:06.182
when he was confronted.

06:06.184 --> 06:07.900
Wait, time-out.

06:07.902 --> 06:09.318
Max, are you actually saying

06:09.320 --> 06:11.187
that you think this
man is a zombie?

06:11.189 --> 06:12.855
I mean, he did bite a guy.

06:12.857 --> 06:15.308
And he tried to bite Max
while he was performing CPR.

06:15.310 --> 06:17.059
Everything you
just described

06:17.061 --> 06:19.728
sounds like someone who was
high on some very heavy drugs.

06:19.730 --> 06:22.231
Well, perhaps your theory
is more plausible, Lieutenant,

06:22.233 --> 06:24.116
but as a manscience,

06:24.118 --> 06:27.003
I have to consider
all possibilities until...

06:29.923 --> 06:31.907
...until proven...

06:33.527 --> 06:34.961
Max?

06:39.182 --> 06:40.216
Oh, God, it's happening.

06:40.218 --> 06:42.018
What? What's happening?
Max.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.103
I've been infected.
BOTH: Max!

06:52.153 --> 06:53.520
I was the officer on scene.

06:53.522 --> 06:54.538
One victim was shot twice.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.572
The other collapsed
in the field

06:55.574 --> 06:57.023
after performing CPR on him.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.325
Call ahead to the O.R.

06:58.327 --> 06:59.576
and get our GSW prepped
for surgery.

06:59.578 --> 07:01.795
Run full labs on the other one.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.081
This guy bit somebody
and then attacked an officer.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.916
It seems like he was under the
influence of some sort of drug.

07:05.918 --> 07:07.668
Sounds like PCP or bath salts.

07:07.670 --> 07:10.254
Your friend may have been
exposed while performing CPR.

07:10.256 --> 07:12.139
I want everyone
in protective gear

07:12.141 --> 07:13.757
while handling our GSW vic.

07:13.759 --> 07:15.876
We don't need anybody
out for the count tonight.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.229
Oh, my God.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.647
It's Michael.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.815
(siren blaring)

07:21.817 --> 07:24.718
Victim's name
is Michael Besner.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.520
He's the chief administrator
of King's Medical Center.

07:26.522 --> 07:27.905
Toxicology came back

07:27.907 --> 07:29.573
with high levels
of a powerful hallucinogen

07:29.575 --> 07:31.625
called scopolamine.

07:31.627 --> 07:32.993
He had traces of it

07:32.995 --> 07:34.244
around his nose and mouth.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.730
Okay, that explains
how Max was affected.

07:36.732 --> 07:38.499
In places like Colombia,
people use scopolamine

07:38.501 --> 07:39.900
to drug and rob tourists.

07:39.902 --> 07:41.785
It leaves its
victims very docile

07:41.787 --> 07:43.570
and very open
to suggestion.

07:43.572 --> 07:46.673
People can actually be sent
up to their own hotel room,

07:46.675 --> 07:48.342
empty their safe, and then
wake up the next morning

07:48.344 --> 07:49.543
with no memory
of what happened.

07:49.545 --> 07:50.844
Okay, wait a minute.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.347
If this drug makes
people easier to handle,

07:53.349 --> 07:55.382
why did Besner here
go off on a violent rampage?

07:55.384 --> 07:56.717
Because it's highly
dose-dependant.

07:56.719 --> 07:58.602
You hit your victim
with too much of it,

07:58.604 --> 08:00.137
and they suffer a
violent psychosis.

08:00.139 --> 08:02.589
And given the fact
that Besner was found

08:02.591 --> 08:03.674
with no keys or wallet...

08:03.676 --> 08:04.775
It's possible that
he was drugged,

08:04.777 --> 08:06.276
then robbed,
then flew off the handle

08:06.278 --> 08:07.311
as a result
of being overdosed.

08:07.313 --> 08:08.428
Right.

08:08.430 --> 08:10.147
So, the good news
is both he and Max

08:10.149 --> 08:11.431
are in stable condition,

08:11.433 --> 08:13.600
but the bad news is whoever
did this is still out there.

08:13.602 --> 08:16.153
Okay, we need to retrace
Besner's steps.

08:16.155 --> 08:17.287
Workout how and where

08:17.289 --> 08:18.655
he was drugged tonight,
and if somebody

08:18.657 --> 08:20.741
on the island is using
scopolamine to rob people,

08:20.743 --> 08:22.626
there could be other victims.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.994
Max must be thrilled.

08:23.996 --> 08:25.913
Pretty sure zombie attack's
on his bucket list.

08:25.915 --> 08:27.247
STEVE:
You're funny. Anyway, listen.

08:27.249 --> 08:28.799
HPD went by Besner's place.

08:28.801 --> 08:29.833
There was no sign

08:29.835 --> 08:31.134
of any break-in or any robbery.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.135
But we tracked
the GPS on his car.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.287
It turned up

08:34.289 --> 08:35.339
on the other side of the island

08:35.341 --> 08:36.590
like 15 miles away
from his house.

08:36.592 --> 08:39.510
Well, whoever robbed him
probably dumped it there.

08:39.511 --> 08:40.811
Right, anyway,
it's a good place to start.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.261
Why don't you pick me up
on the way through?

08:42.264 --> 08:43.397
Can I ask you a question?

08:43.399 --> 08:44.481
How come we never take
your truck?

08:44.483 --> 08:45.516
My tr... Well...

08:45.518 --> 08:48.652
the Camaro gets
great gas mileage, Danny.

08:48.654 --> 08:51.271
Yeah, it's gas mileage
that I got to pay for.

08:53.024 --> 08:54.525
Danny?

08:54.527 --> 08:56.810
Everything all right?

08:56.812 --> 08:58.779
Son of a bitch.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.199
It's a violation, I mean,

09:02.201 --> 09:03.750
any way you look at it,
it's a violation.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.652
The sanctity of my home
has been violated.

09:05.654 --> 09:06.920
It's toilet paper, Danny.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.422
It's a couple of kids
having fun on Halloween.

09:08.424 --> 09:09.339
What's the big deal?

09:09.341 --> 09:11.341
Well, the big deal is,

09:11.343 --> 09:13.377
in my opinion, this is
how most decent kids

09:13.379 --> 09:15.495
turn to a life
of corruption.

09:16.714 --> 09:18.048
Excuse me?

09:18.050 --> 09:21.602
Yeah, TP'ing is
a gateway crime, okay?

09:21.604 --> 09:22.686
It starts with toilet paper,

09:22.688 --> 09:24.021
and then, uh,
next thing you know,

09:24.023 --> 09:25.022
armed robbery.

09:25.024 --> 09:26.223
Okay, well...

09:26.225 --> 09:28.225
you know what, Danny,
if that's the case,

09:28.227 --> 09:30.727
I really hope you catch
these hardened criminals.

09:30.729 --> 09:32.479
And I'm sure it's gonna
be a career case for you.

09:32.481 --> 09:33.981
Don't make fun.

09:33.983 --> 09:36.366
I'm not making fun,
buddy; I am serious.

09:46.427 --> 09:48.695
Okay, which one's
Besner's car?

09:48.697 --> 09:50.030
This is the middle
of nowhere.

09:50.032 --> 09:52.549
What are all these
doing here anyway?

09:52.551 --> 09:55.385
♪

10:09.734 --> 10:11.318
Come on, baby,
come over here.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.520
(slurring words)

10:13.522 --> 10:16.389
(indistinct chatter)

10:16.391 --> 10:18.892
Boys, you guys going up
to the party or what?

10:41.599 --> 10:42.799
You gonna get an evidence bag

10:42.801 --> 10:44.601
or are you gonna put
that thing on?

10:57.699 --> 10:59.282
DANNY: Hey.
STEVE: Huh?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.767
You know what
I never understood?

11:00.769 --> 11:01.985
What it is
about Halloween

11:01.987 --> 11:03.754
that makes girls dress
the way that they dress.

11:03.756 --> 11:05.789
I mean, I am not complaining;
I am grateful.

11:05.791 --> 11:06.940
I'm just saying
it's interesting.

11:06.942 --> 11:08.241
You grateful?
Yeah.

11:08.243 --> 11:10.443
I'll remind you of that
when Grace is a teenager.

11:10.445 --> 11:11.628
Thank you.

11:13.447 --> 11:15.115
MAN:
Henry Upton, officers.

11:15.117 --> 11:16.950
Welcome to my annual gala.

11:16.952 --> 11:20.053
And don't worry, I have
no intention of driving tonight.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.839
Steve McGarrett, Detective
Danny Williams, Five-O.

11:22.841 --> 11:24.290
To what do I owe the pleasure?

11:24.292 --> 11:25.559
Just wondering

11:25.561 --> 11:27.761
if you, uh...
if you recognize this man.

11:29.764 --> 11:32.599
Oh, yeah, of course.
That's Michael Besner.

11:32.601 --> 11:34.067
I sit on his hospital board.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.937
Why, are you...
are you looking for Michael?

11:36.939 --> 11:38.021
Because I'm sure he's...

11:38.023 --> 11:39.439
he's still around here
somewhere.

11:39.441 --> 11:40.741
Uh, no. Actually,

11:40.743 --> 11:42.976
Mr. Upton, Michael's currently
in the hospital

11:42.978 --> 11:44.494
recovering from
two gunshot wounds.

11:45.613 --> 11:47.497
What?

11:48.700 --> 11:50.333
Girls, mingle.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.818
Don't go far.

11:54.372 --> 11:55.488
What happened?

11:55.490 --> 11:58.508
Well, uh, he, uh...
he went a little crazy,

11:58.510 --> 12:01.211
and he attacked some people,
including a police officer.

12:01.213 --> 12:03.096
No, no, no, that doesn't sound
like Michael.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.431
STEVE: No, I'm sure
it doesn't, sir,

12:04.433 --> 12:08.001
but Mr. Besner had, uh,
a drug called scopolamine

12:08.003 --> 12:09.686
in his system.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.672
It's-it's most commonly used
to incapacitate and rob people.

12:12.674 --> 12:14.007
DANNY:
His car is still here,

12:14.009 --> 12:16.777
so we're thinking that,
uh, someone drugged him

12:16.779 --> 12:18.195
and kidnapped him
from your party.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.396
If it's okay with you,

12:19.398 --> 12:21.181
we're gonna need a copy
of your guest list.

12:21.183 --> 12:23.066
Of course.
Please, anything you need.

12:23.068 --> 12:24.451
What about you? You working

12:24.453 --> 12:26.019
the door all night?
Yes, sir.

12:26.021 --> 12:27.687
You see this guy leave?

12:27.689 --> 12:29.072
Yeah, yeah.
He left at about 9:00.

12:29.074 --> 12:30.690
Looked like he had
a few too many and, uh,

12:30.692 --> 12:32.075
had to have
a friend drive him home.

12:32.077 --> 12:34.360
What did his friend look like?

12:34.362 --> 12:36.329
Uh, dark clothes, scary mask.

12:36.331 --> 12:37.697
That's about all I can remember.

12:37.699 --> 12:42.252
STEVE: <i>Okay, Besner leaves here</i>
<i>at 9:00 p.m., right?</i>

12:42.254 --> 12:43.553
Where was he
the three hours

12:43.555 --> 12:45.255
before he, uh...
he got to the screening?

12:45.257 --> 12:46.506
I don't know,
I don't know.

12:46.508 --> 12:48.374
But I think a better
question is: Why take him?

12:48.376 --> 12:50.327
I mean, you got rich people
all over the place, right?

12:50.329 --> 12:51.762
Right, right. Why target
a hospital administrator?

12:51.764 --> 12:53.880
(phone rings) Hold up. It's Chin.
Chin, what do you got?

12:53.882 --> 12:56.233
Looks we were off
on the robbery angle.

12:56.235 --> 12:57.651
Why? What do you mean?

12:57.653 --> 12:59.770
I checked Besner's credit cards
and bank accounts.

12:59.772 --> 13:01.071
Both untouched. But get this:

13:01.073 --> 13:04.491
His keycard was used
at the hospital at 10:21 p.m.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.575
Wait a minute. This entire thing

13:05.577 --> 13:07.160
was about getting access
to the hospital? Why?

13:07.162 --> 13:08.862
I don't know.

13:08.864 --> 13:10.747
But the keycard
was only used in one place.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.082
Where?

13:12.084 --> 13:13.733
Down in the morgue.

13:13.735 --> 13:15.535
Yeah, I've been
here all night.

13:15.537 --> 13:17.537
Only person who came
in was my boss.

13:17.539 --> 13:19.673
Your boss?
You mean Michael Besner?

13:19.675 --> 13:21.007
Yeah. It was weird.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.243
He showed up
around 10:00 p.m.

13:23.245 --> 13:25.512
asking about the status
of a body that came in.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.247
Wanted to see the file.

13:27.249 --> 13:29.749
Then he told me
to go on break.

13:29.751 --> 13:31.434
You see anybody with him?

13:31.436 --> 13:33.887
No. But when I got
back from my break,

13:33.889 --> 13:37.924
he was gone and the file
was still sitting there.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.947
"Lisa Mills." Who is she?

13:43.949 --> 13:45.265
Car accident.

13:45.267 --> 13:46.449
Came in two days ago.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.702
Where's the body?

13:48.704 --> 13:51.905
Drawer seven.
She's right here.

13:51.907 --> 13:52.956
That's...

13:52.958 --> 13:54.624
not right.

13:57.411 --> 13:59.129
You gonna...?

13:59.131 --> 14:01.882
No way, dude.
That's all you.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.217
(chuckles) Okay.

14:18.299 --> 14:19.349
I don't suppose

14:19.351 --> 14:21.351
there's any chance
she came in like this.

14:21.353 --> 14:24.470
Um... no.

14:41.396 --> 14:43.180
DANNY:
That's a very nice man-bag.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.365
Perfect for a human head.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.016
Besner walked right out
of the hospital with it.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.351
Check this out.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.487
Black clothes, scary mask.
I mean, he's gotta

14:50.489 --> 14:52.573
be the guy who abducted Besner
from the party.

14:52.575 --> 14:54.858
Now look at this. This doesn't
make sense to me: Why does he

14:54.860 --> 14:56.827
drug him again after he already
got what he wanted?

14:56.829 --> 14:58.078
So Besner doesn't
remember anything.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.497
And also to buy himself
some more time to get away.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.633
CHIN: Explains why Besner
showed up at the screening

15:02.635 --> 15:04.051
in the condition
he was in.

15:04.053 --> 15:05.702
That second dose
must have sent him

15:05.704 --> 15:07.304
into some sort
of psychotic rage.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.872
Yeah. What it doesn't explain
is why somebody

15:08.874 --> 15:10.224
would go through
all that trouble

15:10.226 --> 15:12.009
just to steal
the head off a body.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.511
CHIN: The morgue attendant also
said that Besner asked

15:14.513 --> 15:16.931
for Lisa Mills specifically.
She wasn't chosen at random.

15:16.933 --> 15:18.315
What do we know about her?

15:18.317 --> 15:21.785
All right. Lisa Mills,
20-year-old local girl.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.939
She died two days ago in a
single-vehicle car accident.

15:24.941 --> 15:26.774
But here's where
it gets weird.

15:26.776 --> 15:29.326
A little over a year ago,
Lisa went missing.

15:29.328 --> 15:30.611
They opened up an
investigation.

15:30.613 --> 15:31.862
No signs of foul play,

15:31.864 --> 15:34.615
and there was no
ransom demand ever made.

15:34.617 --> 15:36.233
It was like this girl
just vanished.

15:36.235 --> 15:40.771
Then, 30 days after that,
she magically reappears.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.108
She's discovered walking
aimlessly along the Kam Highway.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.376
She explain
where she'd been?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.577
Well, that's the
thing-- she couldn't.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.045
Lisa claims that she has no idea

15:48.047 --> 15:50.180
of what happened to her
or how long she was gone.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.016
Now, HPD interviewed her,
but what few facts

15:52.018 --> 15:54.184
she was able
to come up with

15:54.186 --> 15:55.269
were sketchy at best.

15:55.271 --> 15:56.520
So, what did they think,

15:56.522 --> 15:57.638
that she kidnapped herself?

15:57.640 --> 16:00.024
They didn't know what to think.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.976
This girl has a juvenile record,

16:01.978 --> 16:03.694
she's got a history
of drug abuse,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.029
but she passed a polygraph.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.281
The best thing investigators
could come up with

16:07.283 --> 16:08.949
was that she suffered some sort

16:08.951 --> 16:11.435
of psychotic break.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.570
Or maybe Lisa didn't
remember what happened

16:13.572 --> 16:15.623
because her memory
of the events had been wiped.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.274
Using scopolamine.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.376
You're thinking that the guy
who stole Lisa's head

16:19.378 --> 16:21.778
was the same person
that abducted her a year ago.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.797
Look, you said it
yourself, right?

16:23.799 --> 16:25.449
She wasn't chosen
at random.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.584
Maybe the head
was some kind of trophy.

16:28.670 --> 16:31.171
That's a very dark theory,
but I will buy it.

16:31.173 --> 16:34.842
I'd also like to add
that a girl dies in a car wreck

16:34.844 --> 16:36.626
a year after she
mysteriously goes missing

16:36.628 --> 16:38.012
might not be an accident.

16:38.014 --> 16:39.680
Let's have CSU process
the car,

16:39.682 --> 16:41.315
check for any signs
of foul play.

16:41.317 --> 16:43.267
In the meantime,
we need to figure out

16:43.269 --> 16:44.485
who was targeting her.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.191
SABRINA: <i>I'm really glad</i>
<i>that you're okay.</i>

16:51.193 --> 16:55.195
I don't know what I would
have done if I'd lost you.

16:58.783 --> 17:01.201
Did-did you really think
it was a zombie apocalypse?

17:01.203 --> 17:02.953
No.

17:02.955 --> 17:03.954
(chuckles)

17:03.956 --> 17:05.839
But-but if there ever was one

17:05.840 --> 17:10.310
and I'm bitten, I would like you
to kill me before I turn.

17:10.311 --> 17:12.680
No chance!

17:12.682 --> 17:15.132
I'm gonna make you bite me
so that we can live forever

17:15.134 --> 17:16.833
and eat brains and
have zombie babies.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.944
Hmm. Our first date
was in a hospital.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.230
Yeah. I still have that
menu that you made

17:30.232 --> 17:31.598
for the vending machine.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.484
And the scar
where I got shot.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.185
Yeah, it's funny

17:35.187 --> 17:37.321
how our relationship
keeps circling back

17:37.323 --> 17:39.907
to that intensive care ward.

17:39.909 --> 17:42.659
Yeah, we might want
to break that cycle.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.129
Yeah, you're probably right.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.715
(both chuckle)

17:51.920 --> 17:54.338
Lieutenant, you
need to see this.

17:56.374 --> 17:58.258
(clears throat)

17:58.260 --> 18:00.094
What you got?

18:01.513 --> 18:02.730
Oh...

18:11.990 --> 18:13.157
Huh.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.576
(phone rings)

18:15.578 --> 18:18.061
Chin, what do you got?

18:18.063 --> 18:19.413
Just finished processing
Lisa's car.

18:19.415 --> 18:20.781
There's no sign of tampering,

18:20.783 --> 18:24.451
but we found a wireless pinhole
camera hidden in the dashboard.

18:26.704 --> 18:28.589
Somebody was spying on her?

18:28.591 --> 18:29.739
Yeah, looks like it.

18:29.741 --> 18:31.291
And whoever put it there
made sure

18:31.293 --> 18:32.509
it couldn't be traced.

18:32.511 --> 18:35.379
Video stream's routed
to an anonymous proxy.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.881
You find anything
in her apartment?

18:40.468 --> 18:43.270
Let me call you back.

19:02.157 --> 19:04.792
All right, so somebody
planted cameras

19:04.794 --> 19:06.160
in Lisa's car and
her apartment.

19:06.162 --> 19:07.411
Made sure they
were untraceable.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.462
That takes skill.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.714
They also cut her head off
of her body.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.616
That takes
a certain kind of crazy.

19:12.618 --> 19:13.717
Look at this.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.336
(machine beeps,
man breathing heavily)

19:16.338 --> 19:19.306
(beeps, breathing continues)

19:19.308 --> 19:22.009
(beeps, more breathing)

19:22.011 --> 19:24.561
Good. Screening her calls.
Yeah.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.180
We might have to trace those.

19:26.182 --> 19:27.898
(beeping)

19:28.983 --> 19:31.268
The signal is triangulating
in this exact area.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.070
He's gotta be around
here someplace.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.589
(phone rings)

19:35.591 --> 19:37.474
Crime lab.
Right.

19:37.476 --> 19:38.992
Detective Williams.

19:38.994 --> 19:40.310
Ooh, good.

19:41.496 --> 19:43.813
Okay, what about fingerprints?

19:45.083 --> 19:47.751
Okay, what about a brand name?

19:47.753 --> 19:49.586
Okay, is it single-ply
or two-ply?

19:49.588 --> 19:52.289
Okay, well, thank you
for nothing, okay?

19:52.291 --> 19:55.542
Would you call me if you find
anything out? Good-bye.

19:55.544 --> 19:57.211
What?

19:57.213 --> 19:59.596
You had them run the toilet
paper from the tree, didn't you?

19:59.598 --> 20:02.015
I am a victim of a crime,
all right?

20:02.017 --> 20:04.434
These punks, they vandalized
my property. It's not right.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.137
Congratulations, Danny.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.555
You've just become
an angry old man.

20:08.557 --> 20:09.673
Oh, okay. Listen,

20:09.675 --> 20:11.558
I may be angry,
but I'm not old, okay?

20:11.560 --> 20:15.195
All right, this is it.
This is it right here.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.032
Hold on.

20:20.618 --> 20:21.785
Look at this.

20:34.549 --> 20:37.050
Some kind of tunnel in here.

20:38.953 --> 20:41.021
Hey, let's go.
No, I gotta...

20:41.023 --> 20:43.090
I can't go. I can't do it.
Sorry.

20:43.092 --> 20:44.975
Can't do what?

20:44.977 --> 20:48.061
I can't do, uh, caves or tunnels
or, uh, cramped spaces.

20:48.063 --> 20:51.632
Anything where I feel like a...
like a rat. I can't.

20:52.483 --> 20:53.984
You claustrophobic?

20:53.986 --> 20:56.737
A little bit, yeah.

20:59.574 --> 21:01.692
Okay.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.411
Well, uh, wait here.

21:04.413 --> 21:07.063
Okay. I'm sorry.
I just... I can't.

21:07.065 --> 21:08.832
No, it's...
I mean, what are you

21:08.834 --> 21:10.367
gonna do, right?

21:10.369 --> 21:12.069
Thanks.

21:16.758 --> 21:18.759
Hey, Danny.
Huh?

21:20.795 --> 21:23.797
How'd it take me four years
to learn that about you?

21:23.799 --> 21:27.917
I don't know. Maybe you don't
pay such close attention to me.

21:37.445 --> 21:39.062
What's this?

21:39.064 --> 21:40.981
FBI's forensic accounting files
on the Yakuza.

21:40.983 --> 21:42.399
Turns out Riku Sato's
been laundering

21:42.401 --> 21:44.201
a lot of money
through Hawaii lately.

21:45.536 --> 21:46.620
Where'd you get it?

21:46.622 --> 21:48.705
A friend in the Bureau.

21:49.574 --> 21:51.124
Does Steve know
you're doing this?

21:51.126 --> 21:52.709
No, not yet.

21:52.711 --> 21:55.078
But I know that you've been
trying to find out

21:55.080 --> 21:57.297
where Sato's keeping Adam,
and I want to help.

21:58.716 --> 22:01.001
Okay. Tell me
everything you know.

22:02.837 --> 22:05.455
Check out these
deposits here.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.591
Okay, there's no way that Sato's
running that kind of money

22:07.593 --> 22:09.793
through Hawaii without having
someone here to watch it.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.512
So we identify that person,
they lead us to Sato.

22:12.514 --> 22:14.014
Something tells me

22:14.016 --> 22:15.849
you already have an idea
who that person is.

22:15.851 --> 22:17.067
Right here.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.068
Ryu Nabushi.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.469
He's listed
as an officer

22:19.471 --> 22:20.637
on three
of these accounts.

22:20.639 --> 22:21.822
Showed up in Hawaii
right around the time

22:21.824 --> 22:24.358
when the cash
started flowing in.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.159
Now, on paper, he's clean,

22:26.161 --> 22:27.744
but I'm thinking
that's a cover, so...

22:27.746 --> 22:28.996
My best bet?

22:28.998 --> 22:31.365
Nabushi is Sato's
money man.

22:34.085 --> 22:35.585
Catherine, thank you.

22:35.587 --> 22:36.837
I promised Kono

22:36.839 --> 22:38.839
I'd find Adam, and this
is our best lead yet.

22:38.841 --> 22:40.990
But I can't involve
you beyond this.

22:40.992 --> 22:42.876
Yes, you can.

22:42.878 --> 22:44.177
Look...

22:44.179 --> 22:45.846
I lost Billy.

22:45.848 --> 22:48.382
I'm not about
to lose another friend.

I don't know
if you're dumb,

25:10.609 --> 25:12.609
but you are
definitely deranged.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.194
Okay?
To stalk a woman,

25:14.196 --> 25:15.529
and then mutilate
her corpse...

25:15.531 --> 25:17.247
there's got to be something
very wrong with you.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.582
What?

25:18.584 --> 25:20.083
No, no, no, no.

25:20.085 --> 25:21.735
No, no... are you
saying Lisa's dead?

25:21.737 --> 25:23.820
Yes.
No.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.655
Yeah, that's what he's saying.
Hey. That's what he's saying.

25:25.657 --> 25:26.990
She died
in a car accident

25:26.992 --> 25:28.091
two days ago.
And you know what

25:28.093 --> 25:29.042
somebody did last night?

25:29.044 --> 25:30.126
No.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.545
Somebody broke
into the hospital morgue,

25:31.547 --> 25:33.180
and they cut the head
off Lisa's body.

25:33.182 --> 25:34.631
You know anything about that?
No.

25:34.633 --> 25:36.499
Do you know anything about that?
No, no, no, no.

25:36.501 --> 25:37.834
I didn't do that!
I didn't do that!

25:37.836 --> 25:39.102
All I did was call her.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.137
I just wanted to call her
so I could tell her that...

25:43.107 --> 25:44.558

Mm-mm.

25:46.361 --> 25:47.861
Tell her what?

25:47.863 --> 25:49.779
Okay, listen.
Listen to me.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.281
Lisa may be gone,
but we're here to help.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.199
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

25:52.201 --> 25:54.401
You can tell us,
okay?

25:55.369 --> 25:57.370
What... what'd you
want to tell her?

25:57.372 --> 25:59.206
I... I wanted to tell her

25:59.208 --> 26:01.024
that I read
what happened to her...

26:01.026 --> 26:02.876
and that the same thing
happened to me.

26:04.361 --> 26:06.630
Wait, you were
abducted, too?

26:06.632 --> 26:08.698
Two years, three months
and 11 days ago,

26:08.700 --> 26:10.033
they came and took me away,

26:10.035 --> 26:11.501
and they did
things to my head.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.420
And then they tried
to erase what they did,

26:13.422 --> 26:17.057
but... but I still
remember things like...

26:17.059 --> 26:18.875
like the lights and the voices

26:18.877 --> 26:21.177
and-and the way
the place looked, and...

26:21.179 --> 26:23.763
That's why... that's why
they put cameras in my walls

26:23.765 --> 26:24.981
and tapped
my phone.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.549
Because they want to find
out how much I know.

26:26.551 --> 26:27.484
Did you say
that they put

26:27.486 --> 26:28.551
cameras in
your walls?

26:28.553 --> 26:29.903
In the air conditioner

26:29.905 --> 26:31.855
and behind the mirror.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.389
Th-That's why I had
to go underground,

26:33.391 --> 26:35.942
because it's the only place
they can't see me.

26:35.944 --> 26:37.027
Who's "they"?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.078
Who abducted you?
I-I don't know.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.446
I don't know who they are,

26:39.448 --> 26:40.780
but I know they're everywhere.

26:40.782 --> 26:42.782
And they're listening
and they're watching.

26:42.784 --> 26:45.418
And they even tried
to steal my thoughts once.

26:45.420 --> 26:46.903
(laughs)

26:46.905 --> 26:48.371
But I took care of that.

26:53.261 --> 26:55.428
CHIN:
<i>So the guy's name</i>

26:55.430 --> 26:56.630
is Marshall Demps.

26:56.632 --> 26:59.132
ER records show that he
was brought into the hospital

26:59.134 --> 27:00.917
with a self-inflicted
incision

27:00.919 --> 27:02.185
on the back
of his head.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.420
He told doctors there was
an implant in his brain.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.089
Huh. Was there?

27:06.091 --> 27:07.474
No, but they did
find something odd

27:07.476 --> 27:08.425
when they ran a MRI.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.777
As you can see,
the imaging shows

27:10.779 --> 27:13.780
a number of highly localized
histopathological lesions

27:13.782 --> 27:15.482
and <i>T. gondii</i> cysts

27:15.484 --> 27:17.233
on the corpus
amygdaloideum section

27:17.235 --> 27:18.952
of the medial temporal lobe.

27:24.792 --> 27:26.543
Okay.

27:29.046 --> 27:32.115
This part of the brain
is called the amygdala.

27:32.117 --> 27:36.136
Mr. Demps' amygdala
is covered with cysts.

27:36.138 --> 27:38.088
That's weird.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.956
How weird?

27:39.958 --> 27:41.758
Well, we only see it

27:41.760 --> 27:44.227
in severe cases
of toxoplasmosis.

27:44.229 --> 27:47.296
That's an infection due to
the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii.</i>

27:47.298 --> 27:49.099
Once it enters
the host's system,

27:49.101 --> 27:53.770
it migrates to the amygdala,
forming cysts.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.471
So Demps was infected?
Yes.

27:55.473 --> 27:56.439
Intentionally.

27:56.441 --> 27:58.525
What do you mean,
"intentionally"?

27:58.527 --> 28:00.643
Well, I autopsied
Lisa Mills' body

28:00.645 --> 28:02.829
as well as drew blood
from Mr. Demps'.

28:02.831 --> 28:04.664
What I found was that
they both had

28:04.666 --> 28:06.199
an extremely virulent strains

28:06.201 --> 28:08.284
of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>
in their system.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.036
In fact,
their levels

28:10.038 --> 28:12.321
were so high that the only
possible explanation

28:12.323 --> 28:14.758
could be that the parasites
were injected directly.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.676
CHIN:
So both of these victims

28:16.678 --> 28:19.012
were abducted and injected
with this parasite

28:19.014 --> 28:20.046
that affected their brains.

28:20.048 --> 28:21.765
DANNY: And then they
were released,

28:21.767 --> 28:24.333
so they could be spied on
and observed.

28:24.335 --> 28:25.685
Right?

28:25.687 --> 28:27.854
Somebody's been conducting
human experiments.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.640
<i>Okay Lisa, let's start again</i>
<i>from the beginning., ok.</i>

28:52.423 --> 28:55.638
<i>What happened</i>
<i>on the night of July 6, 2012?</i>

28:57.330 --> 28:58.959
<i>I was walking home</i>

28:59.843 --> 29:01.609
<i>when someone came up behind me.</i>

29:02.551 --> 29:04.391
<i>They put something over</i>
<i>my mouth</i>

29:05.575 --> 29:07.693
<i>and everything went black.</i>

29:09.248 --> 29:12.469
I passed out,
for a long time.

29:12.494 --> 29:14.135
It was dark.

29:14.136 --> 29:15.541
Then a light turns on.

29:15.917 --> 29:17.917
<i>It's so bright.</i>

29:18.230 --> 29:20.898
<i>I tried to move,</i>
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

29:22.193 --> 29:23.056
MARSHALL:
<i>My hands and legs</i>

29:23.057 --> 29:24.473
were in restraints.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.670
I heard footsteps.

29:25.672 --> 29:28.806
And then someone was
standing over me.

29:30.192 --> 29:31.509
I couldn't see his face.

29:31.511 --> 29:33.261
But I remember his voice.

29:33.263 --> 29:34.896
And what did he say?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.648
He told me to relax.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.816
That everything
was going to be okay.

29:40.436 --> 29:42.153
Then what happened?

29:42.155 --> 29:45.139
Then I felt like
a pinch in my arm,

29:45.141 --> 29:46.991
like somebody
was drawing blood...

29:48.110 --> 29:49.944
He injected me
with something.

29:50.696 --> 29:52.280
CHIN:
So we got two people

29:52.282 --> 29:54.115
abducted a year apart
from each other,

29:54.117 --> 29:55.649
both of whom
were used as subjects

29:55.651 --> 29:56.817
in a human experiment.

29:56.819 --> 29:58.870
Okay, well,
if we can figure out

29:58.872 --> 30:00.338
how and why
they were selected,

30:00.340 --> 30:02.006
it might help us
identify who took them.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.374
DANNY: Let's start
with Marshall Demps.

30:03.376 --> 30:04.842
He spent most of his life

30:04.844 --> 30:06.594
in and out of shelters,
foster homes.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.195
If you're gonna go snatch
somebody off the street,

30:08.196 --> 30:09.721
maybe better somebody
that won't be missed.

30:09.722 --> 30:10.310
Right.

30:10.311 --> 30:11.850
Yes, but Lisa Mills was
living with her parents

30:11.851 --> 30:13.134
at the time she
was abducted.

30:13.136 --> 30:14.552
So it looks like
the only thing

30:14.554 --> 30:15.636
these two had in common

30:15.638 --> 30:17.105
was that they both
had juvenile records.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.940
Actually, that's
not the only thing

30:18.942 --> 30:20.108
they have in common.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.726
It turns out that both victims
had MRIs ordered

30:21.728 --> 30:22.676
when they were children.

30:22.678 --> 30:25.646
Lisa had hers
when she was 12,

30:25.648 --> 30:27.348
and Demps,
for a concussion he suffered

30:27.350 --> 30:29.200
following a fight
when he was 16.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.319
In both cases, imaging shows

30:31.321 --> 30:33.621
a smaller than average
amygdala.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.289
Which is significant,

30:35.291 --> 30:37.475
because children

30:41.464 --> 30:43.581
in that section of the brain.

30:43.583 --> 30:45.583
STEVE: Okay, wait a minute.
You're saying that

30:45.585 --> 30:47.034
somebody's trying
to reform troubled kids

30:47.036 --> 30:48.336
by messing with their brain?

30:48.338 --> 30:49.587
Yes.

30:49.589 --> 30:52.090
And I think I know who it is.

30:52.092 --> 30:54.792
Ooh, he's been waiting
for this for a very long time.

30:55.928 --> 30:57.929
MAX:
Gentlemen, this video is from

30:57.931 --> 31:00.714
a psychiatric
convention

31:00.716 --> 31:03.434
We don't need more prisons.

31:03.436 --> 31:05.820
What we need is more science.

31:05.822 --> 31:09.190
The criminal mind can be cured.

31:10.275 --> 31:12.076
And I believe
I know how to do it.

31:12.078 --> 31:15.113
The gentleman speaking
is Dr. William Ellery.

31:15.115 --> 31:17.014
He is the holder
of PhDs

31:17.016 --> 31:19.217
in both criminal psychology
and neuroscience.

31:19.219 --> 31:20.201
Dr. Ellery published

31:20.203 --> 31:22.286
numerous articles
detailing his theory

31:22.288 --> 31:25.123
on how criminal behavior
can be adjusted

31:25.125 --> 31:26.740
by targeting
the amygdala.

31:26.742 --> 31:28.242
Then, a couple
years ago,

31:28.244 --> 31:29.961
his work suddenly stopped.

31:29.963 --> 31:31.179
Why?

31:31.181 --> 31:32.296
Last I heard,

31:32.298 --> 31:34.182
Dr. Ellery had left
his research post.

31:35.884 --> 31:37.751
Huh.

31:37.753 --> 31:39.103
He's here.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.539
He was granted
a Hawaii medical license

31:41.541 --> 31:43.307
back in May of 2011.

31:43.309 --> 31:45.109

Take a look at this.

34:55.301 --> 34:57.251
I found out
that Ellery was using

34:57.253 --> 34:59.837
his doctor privileges
to log into imaging centers

34:59.839 --> 35:01.806
all across Hawaii.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.924
In the past year alone,

35:03.926 --> 35:06.761
he's viewed thousands of MRIs.

35:06.763 --> 35:08.796
He's screening
for test subjects.

35:08.798 --> 35:09.847
CHIN:
Exactly.

35:09.849 --> 35:11.899
But he only saved three scans.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.651
Lisa's, Marshall's,

35:13.653 --> 35:16.020
and the third subject's name
is Brock Upton.

35:16.022 --> 35:18.072
Wait a minute. Upton.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.607
That sound familiar
to you?

35:19.609 --> 35:20.775
Yeah, at the party last night.

DANNY: Oh, he didn't
do anything.

35:34.957 --> 35:37.358
You, you're the one who's got
some explaining to do.

you brought Ellery out here

to rehabilitate your son.

35:44.434 --> 35:45.383
DANNY:
Where's Brock?

35:45.385 --> 35:47.101
All right, HPD
went to his house,

35:47.103 --> 35:48.269
he wasn't there. Where is he?

35:48.271 --> 35:50.003
I don't know.

35:50.005 --> 35:51.022
DANNY:

Where's the kid.

35:59.865 --> 36:01.449
(sighs)

36:04.202 --> 36:06.987
All right, look, I sent my son

36:06.989 --> 36:08.322
to all the right
boarding schools,

36:08.324 --> 36:09.457
I got him the psychologists,

36:09.459 --> 36:11.292
I got him all
the right medications.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.359
Nothing worked!

36:12.361 --> 36:14.962
Then I read about
Dr. Ellery's work.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.530
He said the science was sound,

36:16.532 --> 36:17.965
but he couldn't
develop the procedure

36:17.967 --> 36:20.167
because nobody would allow him
to conduct human trials.

36:20.169 --> 36:22.086
So I wrote him a blank check,

36:22.088 --> 36:24.755
and all I said was, "Please...

36:24.757 --> 36:26.507
please fix my son."

36:27.476 --> 36:30.261
What would you have done
if it was your kid?

36:30.263 --> 36:31.595
Me? I don't know. I don't know.

36:31.597 --> 36:33.647
But I definitely
would not let some wack job

36:33.649 --> 36:35.066
inject parasites into his body.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.351
Yeah, well, the idea
of injecting children

36:37.353 --> 36:39.904
with viral antigens was once
considered controversial.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.773
But without inoculations,
we'd still have polio,

36:42.775 --> 36:45.058
we'd still have smallpox.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.394
Bold breakthroughs
take risk.

36:46.396 --> 36:48.662
Right, right.
As long as those risks

36:48.664 --> 36:50.698
are to other people's kids.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.200
I mean, you let this guy
use other people as guinea pigs

36:53.202 --> 36:54.902
to iron out the kinks.

36:54.904 --> 36:56.337
Two lives have been ruined,
okay?

36:56.339 --> 36:57.621
You're complicit
in both of those.

36:57.623 --> 36:58.906
You understand that?

36:58.908 --> 37:01.876
Not to mention luring
Michael Besner to this house

37:01.878 --> 37:03.711
so Ellery could have access
to Lisa's body.

37:03.713 --> 37:07.264
It's unfortunate what happened
to Michael, all right?

37:07.266 --> 37:09.600
But we put a lot of money
into that girl.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.919
Dr. Ellery needed to take
a look at her brain

37:11.921 --> 37:13.420
to make sure there weren't
any complications

37:13.422 --> 37:14.855
from the procedure,
and there weren't.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.424
She was cured.
And now he's gonna cure my son.

37:17.426 --> 37:19.143
Is that what he told you?
Yeah.

37:19.145 --> 37:21.112
Okay, let's take a look at this.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.864
This is a video that I pulled
off his computer.

37:23.866 --> 37:26.033
Take a look at that.
You recognize her? That's Lisa.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.736
DANNY: Dr. Ellery lied
to you, okay?

37:28.738 --> 37:30.771
She had a cyst that
ruptured in her brain,

37:30.773 --> 37:32.289
causing her
to lose consciousness.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.493
That's why she died.

37:39.548 --> 37:42.166
Is this the kind of cure
you want for your son?

37:45.837 --> 37:46.921
Oh, my God.

37:46.923 --> 37:49.006
What have I done?

37:49.008 --> 37:50.307
Where's Brock?

37:52.511 --> 37:56.230
Dr. Ellery phoned me
just a little bit ago.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.933
He said it was time.

37:58.935 --> 38:00.518
Time for what?

38:00.520 --> 38:01.881
