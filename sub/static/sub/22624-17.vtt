WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:06.374
Craig, you're next.

00:06.407 --> 00:09.410
NARRATOR:
On August 19, 2016,

00:09.443 --> 00:14.448
Drake Tester, the 16-year-old
son of treasure hunter

00:14.482 --> 00:17.551
Craig Tester, joined other
members of the Oak Island team

00:17.585 --> 00:22.123
in writing an inscription on
a 50-inch-wide drilling caisson

00:22.156 --> 00:24.225
that everyone hoped
would help them locate

00:24.258 --> 00:26.760
the original Money Pit.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.230
Here you go, bro.

00:37.871 --> 00:42.143
NARRATOR: In so doing,
he made a permanent reminder

00:42.176 --> 00:46.347
of one of the island's most
enduring and powerful truths...

00:48.882 --> 00:51.519
...that the story
of Oak Island is--

00:51.552 --> 00:54.288
as it has been
for more than two centuries--

00:54.322 --> 00:56.490
a story about family.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.495
From the Laginas...

01:01.529 --> 01:04.132
-Okay, but here's the thing.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.600
I'm still in. Let's go.

01:06.634 --> 01:10.338
One in, all in.
Once in, forever in.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.173
NARRATOR:
...to the Blankenships.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.275
DAVE: Mom would be happy
getting it over with.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.776
She wanted it done.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.512
I don't have a reputation
for giving up.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.649
NARRATOR:
Oak Island has been a place

01:21.682 --> 01:24.785
where the compelling desire
to solve a mystery

01:24.818 --> 01:27.821
has lured generations
of treasure hunters.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.591
From former slaves...

01:30.624 --> 01:32.293
Just being a cabbage farmer

01:32.326 --> 01:34.895
could never have given him
enough money

01:34.928 --> 01:37.231
to purchase the property
that he bought.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.633
NARRATOR:
...to future U.S. presidents.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.870
DAVID ROOSEVELT:
FDR was adventurous, and

01:42.903 --> 01:45.206
who wouldn't want to search for

01:45.239 --> 01:47.441
a hidden treasure?

01:47.475 --> 01:51.379
NARRATOR: Families who came
looking for a dream and

01:51.412 --> 01:54.648
who rarely leave willingly,
if they ever leave at all.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.488
JAMES:
It grabs hold like an addiction

02:00.521 --> 02:01.822
that doesn't let go.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.325
Whoa!

02:04.358 --> 02:06.194
DIANA:
We are part of the island,

02:06.227 --> 02:07.861
and the island is part of us.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.371
NARRATOR:
According to legend,

02:17.405 --> 02:21.342
it was on a hot summer night
in June 1795,

02:21.375 --> 02:24.612
that three teenage boys--
Daniel McGinnis,

02:24.645 --> 02:27.615
John Smith and Anthony Vaughn--

02:27.648 --> 02:30.818
traveled to Oak Island
in a rowboat.

02:30.851 --> 02:34.388
RILEY:
They discovered an old oak tree

02:34.422 --> 02:37.725
with a block and tackle
hanging off one of the limbs.

02:37.758 --> 02:42.863
And under the block and tackle
was a depression on the ground.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.533
They started to dig,
and then they quickly realized

02:45.566 --> 02:48.536
that they dug down
to a man-made shaft.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.972
NARRATOR: At a depth
of ten feet, they found a layer

02:52.005 --> 02:55.709
of tightly-packed oak logs
embedded in clay.

02:55.743 --> 02:59.713
They found another layer
of logs at a depth of 20 feet,

02:59.747 --> 03:03.517
then 30,
when it became obvious to them

03:03.551 --> 03:06.654
that they were digging into
something much more complex

03:06.687 --> 03:09.423
than a simple
pirate's treasure hole.

03:09.457 --> 03:13.827
Over the next few years,
the young men formed what

03:13.861 --> 03:16.530
was called
"The Onslow Company."

03:16.564 --> 03:18.866
They continued digging,

03:18.899 --> 03:22.470
until, at a depth of 90 feet,
they found

03:22.503 --> 03:25.873
a large, flat, grey-green stone
on which are carved

03:25.906 --> 03:29.577
a number of strange,
almost hieroglyphic shapes.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.646
After the 90-foot stone was,
uh, recovered,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.448
eventually the Pit flooded.

03:36.484 --> 03:39.520
And digging stopped
for the time being.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.558
NARRATOR:
Although it is widely believed

03:44.592 --> 03:48.329
that McGinnis, Vaughn and Smith
never found so much

03:48.362 --> 03:51.765
as a glint of treasure,
there are those who believe

03:51.799 --> 03:56.637
that a portion of it was, in
fact, recovered very early on,

03:56.670 --> 03:59.273
and that this only fueled

03:59.307 --> 04:02.910
the trio's determination
to keep digging.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.479
DIANA: I believe
that my ancestors did find

04:05.513 --> 04:06.947
some of the treasure.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.449
There was a family story
passed down

04:08.482 --> 04:10.351
that Anthony Vaughan

04:10.384 --> 04:12.853
and some of the other
land owners on the island--

04:12.886 --> 04:15.489
they discovered
a decoy treasure.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.525
They kept it secret

04:17.558 --> 04:20.060
because they didn't want
the other hunters to find it.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.729
But family lore says

04:21.762 --> 04:25.366
that Daniel sold his property
and moved away

04:25.399 --> 04:28.469
and developed a huge
ship-building empire

04:28.502 --> 04:30.338
in New Brunswick.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.574
Anthony Vaughan Sr.'s
two brothers

04:33.607 --> 04:36.009
suddenly were running
the biggest lumber mill

04:36.043 --> 04:38.646
on that part of Nova Scotia
at the time,

04:38.679 --> 04:41.315
and became very wealthy men,
and so the question is,

04:41.349 --> 04:44.552
where did they get the money
to launch this enterprise?

04:44.585 --> 04:46.954
A lot of people said
it came from the Money Pit.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.792
NARRATOR: The idea
that a portion of the treasure

04:51.825 --> 04:55.563
was found
was further reinforced in 2015

04:55.596 --> 04:58.699
when three of Daniel McGinnis'
descendants

04:58.732 --> 05:03.036
returned to Oak Island to share
an incredible family secret

05:03.070 --> 05:05.906
with the Lagina brothers
and their partners.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.543
This is one of the stories
we were told as children.

05:09.577 --> 05:12.980
Grandpa Daniel,
five generations ago--

05:13.013 --> 05:18.786
he and his two friends found
three treasure chests.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.021
-JOAN: Yes.
-I never heard that. -No.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.591
CHARLES:
I never heard that, either.

05:23.624 --> 05:27.928
Daniel took one, Smith took one
and Vaughan took one.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.730
And what is in this box

05:29.763 --> 05:32.666
is one of the things
that came from that chest.

05:32.700 --> 05:37.004
-The one that McGinnis took.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.973
-Let's have a look.
-JACK: Yeah, I got goose bumps.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.609
MARTY:
Wow!

05:43.544 --> 05:45.045
-You may.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.718
Oh, my goodness.

05:50.751 --> 05:54.054
-JOAN: It passed down
to the McGinnis men. -Mm-hmm.

05:54.087 --> 05:59.527
And so my father had it, and
when my brother James was 15,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.895
my father passed it onto him.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.997
And my brother,
the night before he died,

06:04.031 --> 06:07.568
he said, "Never let this
out of your sight."

06:11.472 --> 06:13.741
NARRATOR:
Because early accounts

06:13.774 --> 06:15.976
of the events on Oak Island
are sketchy,

06:16.009 --> 06:18.712
it is often difficult

06:18.746 --> 06:22.883
for the historian
to separate fact from fiction.

06:22.916 --> 06:26.954
One area of confusion even
extends to the identities

06:26.987 --> 06:31.925
and ages of the original
discoverers of the Money Pit.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.995
There are those who believe
that there was a fourth person

06:35.028 --> 06:37.030
involved in the dig:

06:37.064 --> 06:42.870
a former American slave
by the name of Samuel Ball.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.739
Samuel Ball is our great,
great grandfather.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.076
Our mother, May List Boyd,
would recount stories

06:49.109 --> 06:52.613
of a relative living on
Oak Island, and she would say

06:52.646 --> 06:54.748
to me,
"This is our people's land."

06:54.782 --> 06:57.818
And that had just stayed with me
for the rest of my life.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.121
NARRATOR: The extraordinary
story of Samuel Ball

07:01.154 --> 07:07.160
begins in 1776 when, at just
11 years old, he escaped

07:07.194 --> 07:10.063
the South Carolina plantation
where he had been a slave

07:10.097 --> 07:12.600
and made his way north.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.668
During the American War
of Independence,

07:14.702 --> 07:18.205
the British Governor of
Virginia, the Earl of Dunmore,

07:18.238 --> 07:22.109
issued a proclamation granting
freedom to any male slave

07:22.142 --> 07:24.077
who would fight
on the British side,

07:24.111 --> 07:26.980
and thousands did,
and one of these individuals

07:27.014 --> 07:28.549
was Samuel Ball.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.684
RANDALL:
So, Samuel Ball-- he ended up

07:30.718 --> 07:32.920
in New Jersey
until the war ended,

07:32.953 --> 07:36.189
at which time
he made his way to Canada.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.159
ANTHONY: Lieutenant governor
of Nova Scotia,

07:39.192 --> 07:41.595
Mr. George PrÃ©vost, decided

07:41.629 --> 07:45.265
because of his assertiveness,
to give him some-some land.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.868
IVAN B.: They put him on
Oak Island, and that's where

07:47.901 --> 07:50.604
his life actually started here
in Nova Scotia.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.606
Samuel Ball did
purchase land on Oak Island

07:52.640 --> 07:54.107
with eight pounds
of sterling silver,

07:54.141 --> 07:57.545
so, tilling the land
maybe to find

07:57.578 --> 07:59.179
some coins or some silver,

07:59.212 --> 08:00.914
and, uh,
started purchasing land there.

08:03.617 --> 08:08.622
Samuel Ball bought his first lot
on Oak Island in 1787.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.592
And he quickly bought
the lot next to it.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.894
So before the discovery
of the Money Pit,

08:13.927 --> 08:17.230
Samuel Ball actually owned
two lots on Oak Island.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.037
NARRATOR:
In 1870,

08:24.071 --> 08:27.307
Nova Scotia historian
Mather Byles DesBrisay

08:27.340 --> 08:30.844
published A History
of the County of Lunenburg,

08:30.878 --> 08:33.280
one of the first
detailed accounts

08:33.313 --> 08:36.183
of the search
for treasure on Oak Island.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.151
According to DesBrisay,

08:38.185 --> 08:41.188
it was Samuel Ball,
and not John Smith,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.958
who was one of the first
discoverers of the Money Pit.

08:47.695 --> 08:51.632
But if so, why was the account
later changed?

08:51.665 --> 08:54.101
Was it because Samuel Ball--

08:54.134 --> 08:56.970
who would have been
30 years old at the time--

08:57.004 --> 09:00.107
lived on the island,
and didn't want anyone to know

09:00.140 --> 09:02.976
that he was also involved
in the search for

09:03.010 --> 09:05.278
the Oak Island treasure?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.750
Eventually, he had nine lots
on the island.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.753
Plus 100 acres
on the mainland.

09:12.786 --> 09:16.890
So, how did Samuel Ball
accumulate this wealth?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.693
NARRATOR: According
to published accounts,

09:19.727 --> 09:22.329
Samuel Ball worked
as a cabbage farmer

09:22.362 --> 09:24.965
and lived on Oak Island
with his wife Mary

09:24.998 --> 09:28.268
and their three children.

09:28.301 --> 09:33.974
By the time of his death
in 1846 at the age of 81,

09:34.007 --> 09:37.711
he was one of the wealthiest
men in Nova Scotia.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.380
ANTHONY:
Just being a cabbage farmer

09:40.413 --> 09:42.683
could never have given him

09:42.716 --> 09:45.753
enough money to purchase
the property that he bought.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.122
CHARLES: I think he found
something on Oak Island.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.358
I'm absolutely convinced
of that.

09:51.391 --> 09:55.295
All the family knows, uh,
of the story of Sam.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.699
It just gives us so much pride

09:58.732 --> 10:02.703
and feeling of-of understanding
a little bit more of, uh,

10:02.736 --> 10:06.306
the legacy that-that he's left
for, uh, for our family.

10:11.411 --> 10:15.916
In 1861, the Oak
Island Association was formed,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.885
and within months,

10:17.918 --> 10:21.121
experienced the island's
first fatal tragedy--

10:21.154 --> 10:23.423
when the boiler
from a steam-powered

10:23.456 --> 10:29.129
water pump exploded and scalded
an unknown worker to death.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.965
Rumors of a curse began
to circulate,

10:31.999 --> 10:35.035
which inspired
a Halifax newspaper

10:35.068 --> 10:39.439
to run a story about
the treasure hunt in 1864.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.010
In The Colonist, there was
published a three-part story

10:43.043 --> 10:46.880
that gave the full history

10:46.914 --> 10:49.783
of the hunt up until that time
on Oak Island.

10:49.817 --> 10:53.353
Up until that time, it was
a very secretive operation.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.123
NARRATOR:
For the next few decades,

10:56.156 --> 10:58.091
work on the island continued,

10:58.125 --> 11:00.160
but without much success.

11:03.330 --> 11:07.701
It wasn't until 1893
with the formation

11:07.735 --> 11:10.103
of the Oak Island Treasure
Company by Frederick Blair

11:10.137 --> 11:12.740
that Oak Island would enjoy

11:12.773 --> 11:15.042
its most active
and productive period

11:15.075 --> 11:16.877
since the discovery
of the Money Pit

11:16.910 --> 11:19.279
nearly 100 years earlier.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.114
They invested a lot of money

11:21.148 --> 11:24.451
at a time when there wasn't
a lot of money around,

11:24.484 --> 11:27.955
and one of those investors
was William Chappell.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.823
Chappell was an investor,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.159
but he was also
a skilled drill operator.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.931
WOMAN: The Chappell family
actually goes back to France.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.867
My great-grandfather,
William Chappell,

11:39.900 --> 11:41.368
settled in Nova Scotia

11:41.401 --> 11:44.004
and became the lumber baron
of Canada.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.776
NARRATOR:
A skilled drill operator,

11:48.809 --> 11:50.210
William Chappell would leave

11:50.243 --> 11:53.213
a long and lasting legacy
on Oak Island.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.285
He spent decades
trying to solve the mystery,

11:58.318 --> 12:02.089
often aided in that task
by his son Mel,

12:02.122 --> 12:05.826
also known as M.R.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.997
It was William Chappell who,
in 1897,

12:10.030 --> 12:12.465
discovered traces of gold

12:12.499 --> 12:15.002
along with a small fragment
of parchment

12:15.035 --> 12:17.070
after drilling
into what he believed

12:17.104 --> 12:20.373
to be a mysterious
seven-foot-deep wooden box

12:20.407 --> 12:24.144
lying at a depth of 153 feet.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.380
RANDALL:
They put that bit down,

12:27.414 --> 12:29.249
and they brought it up,

12:29.282 --> 12:31.318
and there was
this one very curious object

12:31.351 --> 12:32.820
that no one could identify.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.055
It was this little ball
of something.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.060
DOUG: But when they had opened
this paper up,

12:40.093 --> 12:43.864
they saw what appears to be
the letters "V" and "I."

12:43.897 --> 12:47.300
And, you know, it was
of great wonderment to them

12:47.334 --> 12:49.937
what paper would be doing

12:49.970 --> 12:52.072
down under Oak Island
at that depth.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.245
M.R. Chappell is actually there

12:58.278 --> 13:00.914
when his father
drills through this thing.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.883
Here's a perfect example
how somebody can become

13:02.916 --> 13:04.551
so obsessed with Oak Island.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.921
NEENA: That made
such an impression on him

13:07.955 --> 13:09.522
and what was brought up.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.025
The little piece of parchment

13:12.059 --> 13:15.295
seems to have been very, very
significant to my grandfather.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.299
NARRATOR:
Dubbed the Chappell Vault,

13:19.332 --> 13:22.302
the box was thought to be
the very object

13:22.335 --> 13:24.938
that was originally buried
at the bottom of the Money Pit

13:24.972 --> 13:27.074
more than a century before.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.242
But what was inside?

13:31.879 --> 13:34.314
Rumors of a curse
were also refueled

13:34.347 --> 13:36.984
when, during an excavation
of the Money Pit,

13:37.017 --> 13:39.052
a hoisting rope
slipped off a pulley...

13:41.354 --> 13:43.423
...causing one
of Frederick Blair's workers,

13:43.456 --> 13:45.458
Maynard Keiser, to fall

13:45.492 --> 13:48.161
100 feet down the shaft
to his death.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.867
For months, Blair and Chappell

13:53.901 --> 13:55.568
tried every possible method

13:55.602 --> 13:58.005
to reach
the mysterious wooden box,

13:58.038 --> 14:00.974
but without success.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.178
William Chappell's son, M.R.,

14:05.212 --> 14:07.080
would devote
the rest of his life

14:07.114 --> 14:09.950
to finding someone
who could help him retrieve it.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.423
One of those men
was Captain Henry L. Bowdoin,

14:16.456 --> 14:19.659
a mining engineer who, in 1909,

14:19.692 --> 14:22.329
convinced Frederick Blair
and the Chappells

14:22.362 --> 14:24.898
that he coulach
the Chappell Vault.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.536
Bowdoin's own research
had convinced him

14:29.569 --> 14:32.105
that what lie
at the bottom of the Money Pit

14:32.139 --> 14:35.508
wasn't pirate treasure
but the lost crown jewels

14:35.542 --> 14:38.645
of Queen Marie Antoinette
of France,

14:38.678 --> 14:40.447
and he was joined
in this belief

14:40.480 --> 14:42.582
by a 27-year-old man

14:42.615 --> 14:45.652
who worked with him
on the island that summer:

14:45.685 --> 14:49.189
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.658
I'm a grandson
of Franklin D. Roosevelt

14:51.691 --> 14:54.027
and Eleanor Roosevelt.

14:54.061 --> 14:58.165
FDR was adventurous,
to say the least,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.600
and certainly he was influenced

15:00.633 --> 15:04.171
by his grandfather,
Warren Delano.

15:04.204 --> 15:08.308
He was very much
an adventuresome man, himself.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.110
He would have mentioned

15:10.143 --> 15:13.580
the treasure on Oak Island
to FDR.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.149
And as a young man,
who wouldn't want

15:16.183 --> 15:19.419
to search for a hidden treasure?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.589
NARRATOR:
FDR's grandfather,

15:22.622 --> 15:24.491
Warren Delano, Jr.,

15:24.524 --> 15:27.227
was one of the wealthiest men
in the world,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.963
having made his fortune
by smuggling opium

15:29.997 --> 15:32.432
from China
to the United States.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.437
Warren Delano
became an investor

15:37.470 --> 15:39.172
in the Truro Company,

15:39.206 --> 15:41.641
and his belief
in the island and its treasure

15:41.674 --> 15:45.512
fueled the imagination
of his grandson.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.016
FDR, he had no money of his own.

15:49.049 --> 15:53.086
His mother had money
from her side of the family,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.288
so the way for him

15:55.322 --> 15:59.459
to escape his mother's
purse strings, if you will,

15:59.492 --> 16:02.562
would to find
his own treasure.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.565
NARRATOR:
In 1911, Henry L. Bowdoin

16:05.598 --> 16:09.002
ceased operations
on Oak Island.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.271
But for Franklin Roosevelt,

16:11.304 --> 16:13.406
Oak Island represented a dream

16:13.440 --> 16:15.508
that he never really abandoned,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.177
even after he became

16:17.210 --> 16:19.679
the president
of the United States.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.782
DAVID ROOSEVELT:
FDR continued his interest

16:22.815 --> 16:25.385
well into the '30s and '40s

16:25.418 --> 16:27.420
when he was president.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.522
I hold here in my hands
a letter.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.158
It's on White House stationery

16:31.191 --> 16:34.394
dated August 31, 1938.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.696
It says, "Dear Mr. Hamilton,
your note came

16:36.729 --> 16:38.798
"while I was on my cruise
in the Pacific.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.669
"I wish much I could've gone
up the coast this summer

16:42.702 --> 16:45.638
"and visited Oak Island and see
the work you are doing--

16:45.672 --> 16:48.041
"for I shall always
be interested

16:48.075 --> 16:49.642
in that romantic spot."

16:49.676 --> 16:53.246
NARRATOR: Unfortunately,
Roosevelt's passion

16:53.280 --> 16:55.315
for what he called
"that romantic spot"

16:55.348 --> 16:56.749
ended with his death

16:56.783 --> 17:00.520
from a cerebral hemorrhage
in 1945.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.756
But for M.R. Chappell,
who, like Roosevelt,

17:03.790 --> 17:06.226
was a fellow Freemason,

17:06.259 --> 17:08.395
the search for treasure
on Oak Island

17:08.428 --> 17:12.232
was about to enter
a whole new phase.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.467
What makes sense to me

17:14.501 --> 17:17.837
is the theory that links it
to the Knights Templar

17:17.870 --> 17:22.342
because the Masons derived
from the Knights Templar.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.179
My grandfather became
a Grand Master of the Masons,

17:26.213 --> 17:30.217
so I could see that as being
a real interest of his.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.253
NARRATOR:
By 1957,

17:33.286 --> 17:35.422
M.R. Chappell was now too old

17:35.455 --> 17:38.158
to undertake
the hard work himself.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.728
To that end,
he began negotiations

17:41.761 --> 17:44.464
with a former daredevil
turned treasure hunter,

17:44.497 --> 17:47.100
a man determined to solve

17:47.134 --> 17:50.203
the Oak Island mystery
at all costs--

17:50.237 --> 17:57.377
a man named Robert Restall.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.213
NARRATOR:
In April of 1939,

18:00.247 --> 18:03.183
Popular Science magazine
featured a story

18:03.216 --> 18:05.518
that suggested
the treasure of Captain Kidd

18:05.552 --> 18:07.720
might be buried on Oak Island.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.825
The article
fired the imagination

18:12.859 --> 18:15.295
of a man who believed
that taking chances

18:15.328 --> 18:18.165
was what made life
worth living:

18:18.198 --> 18:19.666
Robert Restall.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.534
RANDALL:
Robert was a daredevil.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.304
He was already working
with carnivals as a...

18:24.337 --> 18:26.773
doing various stunts,
often on motorcycles.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.879
NARRATOR: At the time,
Restall and his wife, Mildred,

18:32.912 --> 18:35.648
had become famous throughout
Europe and North America

18:35.682 --> 18:38.518
as stunt motorcycle performers.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.753
There was a steel globe,

18:40.787 --> 18:44.557
and, uh, Mum would ride
horizontally in the globe,

18:44.591 --> 18:46.559
and Dad would join her,

18:46.593 --> 18:48.795
and then he would loop.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.898
And so they were going
at cross

18:51.931 --> 18:55.802
And they were the first
to-to do a double act

18:55.835 --> 18:57.937
in a globe of death.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.441
NARRATOR:
But by the early 1950s,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.910
the couple had moved
to Ontario, Canada,

19:03.943 --> 19:07.414
where Robert found work
in a steel plant

19:07.447 --> 19:10.817
and Mildred was busy raising
the couple's three children,

19:10.850 --> 19:14.854
Lee, Bobby Jr., and Rick.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.724
He was a very,
very intelligent man.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.427
He could fabricate things,
build things.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.729
If something broke down,
he could fix it.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.632
He was a mechanical genius,
basically.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.900
NARRATOR:
But Robert Restall yearned

19:27.934 --> 19:30.703
for his prior life
of adventure.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.605
He wanted a future.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.475
He wanted Oak Island.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.511
DOUG:
Around 1955,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.680
Robert came home one day
and announced

19:40.713 --> 19:43.550
that instead of going back
to work in the steel plant,

19:43.583 --> 19:47.520
he was gonna go
treasure hunting on Oak Island.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.391
RANDALL: He got every single
available document, book--

19:51.424 --> 19:54.861
you name it-- maps, charts,
and studied Oak Island.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.962
It was his passion.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.666
RICKY:
I saw them at the door,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.668
and they had
all their stuff packed.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.403
And they said,
"We're going to Oak Island."

20:03.436 --> 20:06.573
And I was completely
flabbergasted.

20:06.606 --> 20:10.443
NARRATOR:
On October 15, 1959,

20:10.477 --> 20:12.945
Robert Restall
arrived on Oak Island

20:12.979 --> 20:15.648
with $8,000 worth of equipment

20:15.682 --> 20:18.451
and his wife and two sons
in tow.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.321
Robert had convinced
M.R. Chappell

20:21.354 --> 20:23.556
that he alone
could solve the mystery

20:23.590 --> 20:25.592
and unearth the treasure

20:25.625 --> 20:27.527
and that he could do it
within a year.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.662
LEE: He knew
what the others had done

20:29.696 --> 20:31.898
and where
they had fallen short.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.434
Sometimes fortunes were wasted

20:34.467 --> 20:36.903
because they didn't listen
to the workingmen

20:36.936 --> 20:39.272
who'd been on the last project.

20:39.306 --> 20:41.641
But Dad was going to
take everything

20:41.674 --> 20:43.676
just the one step further,

20:43.710 --> 20:45.345
and he really believed
he could do it

20:45.378 --> 20:46.713
in about three months.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.716
NARRATOR:
For the first few months,

20:49.749 --> 20:52.018
life for the Restalls
was primitive.

20:52.051 --> 20:55.855
There was no running water,
no electricity.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.924
Because everything
from the mainland

20:57.957 --> 20:59.859
had to be gotten by boat,

20:59.892 --> 21:02.362
a simple trip
to the grocery store

21:02.395 --> 21:05.998
could take the better part
of an entire day.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.735
RICKY: Living conditions
were extremely primitive

21:08.768 --> 21:12.672
but also wild
and kind of, uh, novel.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.507
I mean, I was living in a cabin

21:14.541 --> 21:16.609
on the beach with my brother.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.811
My parents were living
in a cabin by the Money Pit

21:18.845 --> 21:20.680
on the top of the hill.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.616
NARRATOR: But if life was tough
for the Restalls,

21:23.650 --> 21:27.053
it was perhaps toughest
for Bobby Jr.

21:27.086 --> 21:30.823
He was 18 years old
when he arrived on the island,

21:30.857 --> 21:33.893
an age when most of his peers
were going to school dances

21:33.926 --> 21:35.762
and dreaming of a future.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.732
Instead, Bobby stuck
by his father's side,

21:39.766 --> 21:41.934
helping with the hard work,

21:41.968 --> 21:44.771
and keeping track of nearly
every day's progress,

21:44.804 --> 21:46.639
or lack of it,

21:46.673 --> 21:49.742
in a meticulously kept series
of journals.

21:49.776 --> 21:53.746
"Wednesday, September 28, 1960.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.648
"Dad cleared off beach,

21:55.682 --> 21:57.850
"and found drilled rock
at low tide line,

21:57.884 --> 21:59.852
"about four feet from dock.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.622
"Tuesday, June 6, 1961.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.924
"Worked in hole,

22:04.957 --> 22:07.594
"found it to be
about 18 inches across,

22:07.627 --> 22:11.063
and possibly lined with stones
about five feet down."

22:11.097 --> 22:14.701
LEE: When I first saw
Bobby's journals,

22:14.734 --> 22:19.105
I was astonished that he
had been so diligent.

22:19.138 --> 22:23.610
Right to the bitter end,
he kept that journal.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.011
I think that

22:25.044 --> 22:27.547
this is a huge legacy

22:27.580 --> 22:29.682
for my family to leave.

22:29.716 --> 22:33.420
I think that, uh,
it's amazing work.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.692
NARRATOR: But as weeks
stretched to months,

22:39.726 --> 22:41.928
and months into years,

22:41.961 --> 22:45.465
life for the Restalls
became unbearable.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.933
RICKY:
It was hard for the men

22:46.966 --> 22:48.735
because very physical,

22:48.768 --> 22:51.771
and very demanding work,

22:51.804 --> 22:54.974
and there was no rest, really,
until you fell asleep.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.577
My mother worked quite hard

22:57.610 --> 23:00.079
and I was tired of living
in rubber boots.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.948
NARRATOR: What Robert Restall
promised his family

23:01.981 --> 23:03.850
would be an adventure,

23:03.883 --> 23:06.118
turned into years of struggle

23:06.152 --> 23:09.088
and back-breakingly hard work.

23:09.121 --> 23:12.091
The length of the adventure
was the problem,

23:12.124 --> 23:14.661
in the end, for both her
and myself.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.929
It just never seemed to end.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.101
NARRATOR:
By 1965, Robert Restall

23:22.134 --> 23:24.537
had invested five years
of his life,

23:24.571 --> 23:26.606
and the lives of his family,

23:26.639 --> 23:29.609
on a dream that had turned
into an obsession.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.945
Because he never owned land
on the property,

23:32.979 --> 23:36.483
he was constantly under
pressure to produce results,

23:36.516 --> 23:38.585
or to leave empty-handed.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.120
As far as he was concerned,

23:41.153 --> 23:42.755
the treasure needed
to be found.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.658
And time was running out.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.527
CHARLES: It's very easy
to become obsessed here.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.862
Robert absolutely believed

23:49.896 --> 23:52.599
that he was close
to solving this.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.234
So I feel that the treasure
is here

23:55.267 --> 23:56.903
and that we can get it,

23:56.936 --> 23:58.838
and we're going to stay here
until we do.

24:05.244 --> 24:08.080
NARRATOR:
In the summer of 1965,

24:08.114 --> 24:11.584
Robert Restall discovered
what he believed

24:11.618 --> 24:13.185
was one of the original
flood tunnels

24:13.219 --> 24:15.622
running under Smith's Cove.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.224
If the water
in the flood tunnel

24:18.257 --> 24:20.593
could be diverted
to another shaft,

24:20.627 --> 24:24.130
access to the Money Pit
would finally be possible.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.567
Digging a shaft 27 feet deep,

24:27.600 --> 24:30.937
Restall was convinced
that he was just days away

24:30.970 --> 24:34.240
from finally solving
the Oak Island mystery.

24:34.273 --> 24:38.044
But, unfortunately,
Robert Restall's dream

24:38.077 --> 24:41.781
of finding the treasure was
about to become a nightmare.

24:43.049 --> 24:46.118
On the 17th of August 1965,

24:46.152 --> 24:47.920
Robert had said to his wife,
Mildred,

24:47.954 --> 24:49.689
"I'm gonna check the pit
on the shore,

24:49.722 --> 24:52.091
and then we're gonna go
into Chester."

24:52.124 --> 24:55.127
DOUG: Robert walked down
to Smith's Cove

24:55.161 --> 24:59.599
to take another look at the--
their current work,

24:59.632 --> 25:01.133
and while he was looking
in the shaft,

25:01.167 --> 25:03.202
he tumbled in.

25:05.137 --> 25:08.941
Bobby quickly went to his aid.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.910
He's, like, 24 years old
at the time.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.780
And he immediately clambers
down through the ladder,

25:13.813 --> 25:15.782
and-and he's holding his
father's head over water

25:15.815 --> 25:17.149
until he collapses.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.953
And then it's just
a domino effect.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.989
Carl Graeser, he goes down.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.091
Cyril Hiltz,
who was 16 years old.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.026
It's just one right after
the other.

25:27.059 --> 25:30.763
The only thought is, "save the
guy that went before me."

25:30.797 --> 25:33.966
MILDRED: At the time,
I was up in the cabin,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.235
and I know it was after lunch,

25:36.268 --> 25:39.205
and I was expecting my husband
to come up any time.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.641
And I waited a few minutes
and then went down,

25:41.674 --> 25:47.279
and, um, by-by then,
it was all over.

25:47.313 --> 25:51.083
And, um, I--
that's when I learned

25:51.117 --> 25:53.886
that my husband, son
and two other men were dead.

25:58.691 --> 26:03.029
DOUG: They had succumbed
to some kind of noxious gas

26:03.062 --> 26:05.264
that had caused this tragedy.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.971
Four people lost their lives
that day.

26:12.004 --> 26:15.341
Robert Restall, Sr.,
Bobby Restall,

26:15.374 --> 26:20.279
Cyril Hiltz and Carl Graeser.

26:23.182 --> 26:27.119
NARRATOR: At the end of Bobby
Restall's meticulous journals,

26:27.153 --> 26:31.290
he wrote the date
August 17, 1965.

26:33.292 --> 26:37.830
All that followed
were a number of blank pages.

26:37.864 --> 26:41.167
It would be a symbol of a life
cut tragically short

26:41.200 --> 26:43.670
and the promise of a treasure

26:43.703 --> 26:48.107
that he and his father
would never find.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.644
RICK: You know what?
I mean, we can't change this.

26:51.678 --> 26:54.981
We can't do anything about it,
but I hope, perhaps,

26:55.014 --> 26:58.818
on the end of this book, you and
I can fill in, here...

26:58.851 --> 27:02.655
-excuse me... that we finish.
-Mmm. Well, that would...

27:02.689 --> 27:05.692
Yeah, finish the search.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.996
Let's make a promise.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.664
Okay.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.101
NARRATOR:
Eight months prior

27:15.134 --> 27:17.837
to the tragic events
of August 17,

27:17.870 --> 27:21.107
the Reader's Digest published
a six-page story

27:21.140 --> 27:25.044
about the search for treasure
on Oak Island.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.948
This modest story fueled
the imagination of a man

27:28.981 --> 27:31.250
who continues to have
a profound effect

27:31.283 --> 27:33.252
on the island and its history

27:33.285 --> 27:36.756
to this day, Dan Blankenship.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.458
DAN B.: I first read
about Oak Island

27:39.491 --> 27:41.861
in Reader's Digest.

27:41.894 --> 27:45.865
In January of '65,
when I read the article,

27:45.898 --> 27:48.200
and I handed it back to my wife

27:48.234 --> 27:50.937
and I said "There's treasure
on Oak Island,

27:50.970 --> 27:54.874
and I'm gonna be instrumental
in discovering it."

27:54.907 --> 27:56.709
DAVE: When Dad said,
"Well, I'm gonna take a trip

27:56.743 --> 27:58.310
up to Nova Scotia,"

27:58.344 --> 28:00.112
so I said, fine,
it's a road trip.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.816
I'm 16, 17 years old, it's cool.

28:06.152 --> 28:09.055
NARRATOR: Over the next two
years, Dan would dissolve

28:09.088 --> 28:11.858
a successful Florida-based
contracting company

28:11.891 --> 28:13.760
so that he and his wife Jane

28:13.793 --> 28:15.394
could pack up everything
they owned

28:15.427 --> 28:18.264
and move to Nova Scotia.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.801
Although Dan had had a brief
meeting with Robert Restall

28:21.834 --> 28:24.971
just one week prior to
the fatal accident,

28:25.004 --> 28:28.274
it was Dan's intention to join
forces with the next person

28:28.307 --> 28:30.910
who was now in charge
of the treasure hunt,

28:30.943 --> 28:34.046
Robert Dunfield.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.248
A geologist from California,

28:36.282 --> 28:39.051
Robert Dunfield had been
one of Robert Restall's

28:39.085 --> 28:41.754
biggest investors.

28:41.788 --> 28:45.892
SHARON:
Dad was continually exploring.

28:45.925 --> 28:50.229
Dad would take Mom and I
out on exploring excursions.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.032
Anywhere where Dad thought that
there might be something

28:53.065 --> 28:55.234
that he could find.

28:55.267 --> 28:59.138
NARRATOR: Robert Dunfield's
decision to take charge

28:59.171 --> 29:02.108
was a way to protect
his investment.

29:02.141 --> 29:05.912
It was also, he felt, a way
to honor the memories

29:05.945 --> 29:11.183
of Robert Restall and those
who perished with him.

29:11.217 --> 29:14.286
SHARON: The lives changed
through death,

29:14.320 --> 29:16.188
that stayed with Dad.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.490
But he never would have
stopped,

29:18.524 --> 29:22.428
because he felt that with
the continuing of the dig,

29:22.461 --> 29:27.099
he was honoring their memory.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.902
NARRATOR:
After moving to Nova Scotia

29:29.936 --> 29:31.838
with his wife Aleen,

29:31.871 --> 29:35.842
Robert Dunfield was a man
on a mission.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.144
There were only six months
remaining

29:38.177 --> 29:41.247
on the Restall
treasure license, and he knew

29:41.280 --> 29:44.250
that if he didn't find
the treasure within that time,

29:44.283 --> 29:47.920
he might be squeezed out
by other would-be investors.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.922
Going for broke,

29:49.956 --> 29:52.458
Dunfield poured nearly every
nickel he had left

29:52.491 --> 29:56.896
to bring heavy digging
equipment to the island.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.431
After first creating
a 600-foot causeway

29:59.465 --> 30:01.901
linking the island
to the mainland

30:01.934 --> 30:04.303
for the first time
in its history,

30:04.336 --> 30:08.040
he then tackled the Money Pit
head-on.

30:08.074 --> 30:11.443
For the next several weeks,
he, and a team of workers

30:11.477 --> 30:14.080
that included James Troutman,
Jimmy Kaiser,

30:14.113 --> 30:16.182
and Dan Blankenship,

30:16.215 --> 30:18.317
tried to reach the bottom of
the Pit

30:18.350 --> 30:22.154
by digging an enormous hole,
100 feet wide

30:22.188 --> 30:26.392
by an estimated 140 feet deep.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.528
His methodology was
big equipment,

30:29.561 --> 30:32.498
move a lot of earth, and that's
how you get to the treasure.

30:32.531 --> 30:36.969
But, unfortunately,
by doing so,

30:37.003 --> 30:38.905
he obliterated a lot
of the landmarks

30:38.938 --> 30:41.307
in the Money Pit area.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.176
Now, had he found the treasure,
he'd have been a hero.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.112
But that's not the case.

30:49.315 --> 30:52.184
NARRATOR: Robert Dunfield left
Oak Island exhausted,

30:52.218 --> 30:54.921
frustrated and nearly broke,

30:54.954 --> 30:57.957
but his departure would soon
pave the way

30:57.990 --> 31:00.459
for yet another generation
of treasure hunters.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.529
Men whose tenure on the island

31:03.562 --> 31:06.865
would last for more than
half a century.

31:12.304 --> 31:15.641
NARRATOR: Within three months
of the departure

31:15.674 --> 31:19.345
of Robert Dunfield
in August 1966,

31:19.378 --> 31:21.981
a new trio of treasure hunters

31:22.014 --> 31:24.683
took over the operations
on Oak Island:

31:24.716 --> 31:28.554
Fred Nolan, David Tobias
and Dan Blankenship.

31:30.556 --> 31:34.193
I thought at the time they were
going about it wrong,

31:34.226 --> 31:36.328
but they insisted
on just staying

31:36.362 --> 31:38.397
in the Money Pit area,
you know.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.533
But I could see evidence
of fact

31:41.567 --> 31:43.535
that people had done work

31:43.569 --> 31:45.537
all over the island.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.475
NARRATOR: Although David Tobias
and Dan Blankenship

31:49.508 --> 31:52.178
would later form
the Triton Alliance,

31:52.211 --> 31:55.181
and ultimately gain control
over most of the island,

31:55.214 --> 31:57.649
Fred Nolan soon emerged

31:57.683 --> 32:00.052
as not simply
a neighboring landowner,

32:00.086 --> 32:02.054
but a fierce competitor.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.224
Originally invited to Oak
Island by M.R. Chappell

32:05.257 --> 32:08.160
as a land surveyor in 1961,

32:08.194 --> 32:11.730
Nolan found that seven
of the four-acre lots

32:11.763 --> 32:13.365
were not owned by Chappell,

32:13.399 --> 32:16.068
and purchased them himself.

32:16.102 --> 32:19.138
Nolan's claim
on 28 precious acres,

32:19.171 --> 32:22.208
including part
of the triangle-shaped swamp,

32:22.241 --> 32:26.278
sparked a bitter feud
that would last for years.

32:26.312 --> 32:29.381
Nolan, historically,

32:29.415 --> 32:32.051
has gone
on Mr. Chappell's property,

32:32.084 --> 32:35.687
and I didn't object
too strenuously at the time,

32:35.721 --> 32:38.057
thinking I would
at least get copies

32:38.090 --> 32:41.527
of what he was doing
on Chappell's property.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.595
But I found out very quickly,

32:43.629 --> 32:46.098
you don't get anything
like that from Nolan.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.600
So, I mean, I found

32:48.634 --> 32:54.106
that Mr. Nolan was
very deliberately evasive

32:54.140 --> 32:56.508
over all the many years.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.578
FRED: Dan Blankenship,
he was a nice guy, but, uh,

32:59.611 --> 33:02.281
this place gets...
seems to get hold of people.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.682
People become very possessive.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.152
It made it difficult.

33:06.185 --> 33:09.155
NARRATOR:
For the next five decades,

33:09.188 --> 33:11.323
Fred Nolan spent
thousands of hours

33:11.357 --> 33:13.792
scouring the surface
of Oak Island for clues

33:13.825 --> 33:15.761
that he believed would point

33:15.794 --> 33:18.530
to the treasure's
ultimate hiding place.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.667
In the swamp,
he discovered several objects

33:21.700 --> 33:24.336
that convinced him
that a large wooden ship,

33:24.370 --> 33:26.338
possibly a pirate ship,

33:26.372 --> 33:29.241
had been buried
underneath layers of mud.

33:29.275 --> 33:32.378
He also believed
that the swamp was man-made,

33:32.411 --> 33:35.414
formed by building
two enormous cofferdams

33:35.447 --> 33:38.284
at both the north
and south shores of the island,

33:38.317 --> 33:41.753
draining them, and then
filling them up with landfill

33:41.787 --> 33:45.124
after the digging
at the Money Pit was completed.

33:45.157 --> 33:47.759
But perhaps Fred Nolan's
biggest breakthrough

33:47.793 --> 33:50.262
came in 1981,

33:50.296 --> 33:54.200
with the discovery of what
he dubbed Nolan's Cross,

33:54.233 --> 33:57.269
a curious collection
of six enormous boulders

33:57.303 --> 34:00.572
whose dimensions are thought
to represent everything

34:00.606 --> 34:03.509
from a Christian cross
to the Tree of Life,

34:03.542 --> 34:06.645
as referenced
in ancient Hebrew scriptures.

34:09.881 --> 34:13.319
The boulders forming this cross
are very large.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.154
And I saw it was a cross.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.488
There was no question
about that.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.124
But what does it mean?

34:18.157 --> 34:19.858
You know, I guess it takes you

34:19.891 --> 34:23.262
to where one of the treasures
is located.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.597
NARRATOR: But for all
the discoveries claimed

34:25.631 --> 34:28.100
on Oak Island by Fred Nolan,

34:28.134 --> 34:30.269
they were overshadowed
by the discovery

34:30.302 --> 34:34.306
made by Dan Blankenship
in the early 1970s,

34:34.340 --> 34:37.643
after digging what he believed
was a back door entrance

34:37.676 --> 34:41.680
into the fabled Money Pit,
10-X.

34:41.713 --> 34:44.883
10-X is a shaft
that was engineered long ago

34:44.916 --> 34:47.253
by Mr. Blankenship.

34:47.286 --> 34:50.422
That was the breakup
of the Triton Alliance Company.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.624
Mr. Tobias wanted
to focus on the Money Pit,

34:52.658 --> 34:55.261
and Dan constructed 10-X.

34:55.294 --> 34:58.830
NARRATOR: Dan Blankenship
dug 10-X without the help

34:58.864 --> 35:01.600
of big rigs
and drilling caissons.

35:01.633 --> 35:05.671
After first excavating
a 27-inch-wide borehole

35:05.704 --> 35:09.175
down to a final depth
of 235 feet,

35:09.208 --> 35:11.810
Dan, wearing only
a simple wet suit

35:11.843 --> 35:13.845
with a surface supply
of oxygen,

35:13.879 --> 35:16.582
made the first perilous journey
downward

35:16.615 --> 35:20.586
into what appeared to be
a man-made chamber.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.554
There were pictures taken,

35:22.588 --> 35:25.357
somewhat subjective,
but indicating

35:25.391 --> 35:28.827
that there was man-made objects
in that cavern.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.762
That's a game changer.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.899
If there's man-made objects
at 235 feet,

35:33.932 --> 35:36.768
they were only there
because men put them there.

35:36.802 --> 35:40.172
NARRATOR: Dan was astonished
at what he believed he saw,

35:40.206 --> 35:43.409
evidence of ancient tools,

35:43.442 --> 35:45.411
wooden posts,

35:45.444 --> 35:48.914
a large square object
resembling a treasure chest,

35:48.947 --> 35:52.784
even what appeared to be
the remains of a dead body.

35:52.818 --> 35:56.955
Dan and his team believe
they were only a few feet away

35:56.988 --> 36:00.892
from entering the Money Pit and
solving the Oak Island mystery.

36:00.926 --> 36:04.696
Only one thing stood
in their way: money.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.532
And to reach their goal,

36:06.565 --> 36:12.871
they were going to need
a lot of it.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.441
: When the January issue
of Reader's Digest

36:15.474 --> 36:17.876
was published in 1965,

36:17.909 --> 36:20.246
among the many readers
who were captivated

36:20.279 --> 36:22.348
by the article on Oak Island

36:22.381 --> 36:25.951
was an 11-year-old boy from
Michigan's Upper Peninsula,

36:25.984 --> 36:27.953
Rick Lagina.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.888
Something grabbed ahold of me.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.490
And I took it home,

36:31.523 --> 36:34.526
and I read it to my brother.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.562
I'm 11. He's eight.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.830
I mean, it's mystery, treasure.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.300
You know,
the story of the boys, really,

36:41.333 --> 36:43.235
I think that was the key thing.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.937
These boys find this mystery

36:45.971 --> 36:49.275
which evolves
into this Oak Island story.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.277
200 years of story.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.412
NARRATOR:
In 2005,

36:53.445 --> 36:56.582
after decades
of unsuccessful search efforts,

36:56.615 --> 36:58.584
Dan Blankenship's
business partner,

36:58.617 --> 37:01.387
David Tobias, wanted out.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.890
As a result,
50% of Oak Island Tours,

37:04.923 --> 37:07.759
the company set up by Tobias
and Blankenship,

37:07.793 --> 37:09.528
was for sale.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.730
And there was one man
in Michigan

37:11.763 --> 37:13.799
who couldn't be more excited--

37:13.832 --> 37:15.501
Rick Lagina.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.936
In 2006, Rick,

37:17.969 --> 37:20.939
his brother Marty, and
their Michigan-based partners

37:20.972 --> 37:23.842
made a deal that would make
them 50% owners

37:23.875 --> 37:25.711
in Oak Island Tours.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.646
But, believe it or not,

37:27.679 --> 37:29.815
it was not the Laginas'
first attempt

37:29.848 --> 37:31.617
to join the treasure hunt.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.785
They had tried,
without success,

37:33.819 --> 37:37.489
some ten years earlier.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.491
-We sat on the other end of
the causeway. -To push our way

37:39.525 --> 37:41.693
past that bloody causeway.
I mean, it was...

37:41.727 --> 37:43.362
And there it was,
Oak Island, you know?

37:43.395 --> 37:45.297
And I said,
"Okay, well, you go."

37:45.331 --> 37:47.032
"No, you go."
-And I said, "You go."

37:47.065 --> 37:49.501
And so we're sitting there,
like, you know, like kids again.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.603
I said, "Just drive."

37:51.637 --> 37:53.339
-So we went across.
-And so we... Yeah.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.006
And then we ran into
Dan Blankenship.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.843
He was cutting trees
in the woods,

37:57.876 --> 37:59.911
felling trees for David's house.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.414
So I get out and I start helping
him push down trees.

38:02.448 --> 38:05.617
And he didn't say a word,

38:05.651 --> 38:08.654
didn't stop the chainsaw,
just kept-kept after it, and...

38:08.687 --> 38:10.722
Anyway, so it didn't...
it didn't work out.

38:10.756 --> 38:14.092
And Rick was horribly
disappointed, I remember.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.529
NARRATOR: But now the Laginas
and their partners

38:17.563 --> 38:20.832
were finally in business
with Dan Blankenship,

38:20.866 --> 38:25.371
and the search for treasure
on Oak Island was back on.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.906
*

38:27.939 --> 38:30.476
With his brother Marty
at his side,

38:30.509 --> 38:33.945
Rick Lagina could finally apply
his lifetime of research

38:33.979 --> 38:36.615
to solving
this centuries-old mystery.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.451
Working with their close friend
and business partner

38:39.485 --> 38:42.854
Craig Tester, along with
friends and family members,

38:42.888 --> 38:46.057
the Laginas set out
to recap everything,

38:46.091 --> 38:50.462
from washed-out roadways
to damaged relationships.

38:50.496 --> 38:53.599
So, it's time to quit the
fighting and cooperate, right?

38:53.632 --> 38:56.802
-It hasn't accomplished much.
-No.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.405
Yeah, I don't want to be
an obstacle anymore.

38:59.438 --> 39:02.107
Welcome to the team.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.476
The Laginas and their partners

39:04.510 --> 39:07.012
also built
a permanent visitors center,

39:07.045 --> 39:10.115
which houses an invaluable
collection of artifacts

39:10.148 --> 39:13.452
and memorabilia
related to the search.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.054
But amid all
of the mysterious artifacts

39:16.087 --> 39:18.156
and all the countless theories

39:18.189 --> 39:20.826
about what may be buried
on Oak Island,

39:20.859 --> 39:23.462
one fact is certain:

39:23.495 --> 39:26.432
Oak Island is about family.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.700
We're gonna put a time capsule
in the ground

39:28.734 --> 39:31.870
at the bicentennial memorial.
I kind of wrote a little letter.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.172
It's-it's to the people
that will open this,

39:34.205 --> 39:36.575
and it's-it's to all of us.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.077
It says,
"Dear Oak Island searchers,

39:39.110 --> 39:41.713
"we have met so many gracious
and wonderful people,

39:41.747 --> 39:44.483
"it is impossible to acknowledge
and thank everyone,

39:44.516 --> 39:45.784
"though I would try.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.787
"I especially wish to say to...

39:48.820 --> 39:52.758
"my brother and friend that I--

39:52.791 --> 39:55.894
"and I do not use the term
lightly--

39:55.927 --> 39:58.464
I treasure this time
we have spent together."

39:58.497 --> 40:01.700
-Oh, come on!

40:01.733 --> 40:03.469
MARTY: You end up feeling
like you're part

40:03.502 --> 40:05.604
of this series of families.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.440
An individual first becomes
quite enamored of the island,

40:08.474 --> 40:10.175
and then, because
they're part of families,

40:10.208 --> 40:12.778
the family gets drawn in.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.614
DIANA:
Oak Island becomes an obsession

40:15.647 --> 40:19.785
for families who are a part
of the island history.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.053
-Hi, Rick!
-Welcome back!

40:22.087 --> 40:24.490
-Welcome back!

40:24.523 --> 40:26.124
LEE:
Oak Island

40:26.157 --> 40:29.828
managed to wheedle its way
into my heart.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.098
Oak Island has
a very strong pull.

40:33.131 --> 40:36.635
Yeah, I remember
the path we used

40:36.668 --> 40:40.772
to come from the Money Pit area
down to Smith's Cove.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.908
It's surprising
how small it looks now.

40:42.941 --> 40:46.545
: Yeah,
everything looks smaller.

40:46.578 --> 40:49.481
My family and I have a great,
uh, sense of pride

40:49.515 --> 40:51.116
being part of the Ball family.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.851
This is where it began.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.219
It's just not the treasure

40:54.252 --> 40:55.987
but it's the families' lives

40:56.021 --> 40:58.223
that have been involved
in this hunt.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.794
It's just incredible, eh?

41:04.963 --> 41:09.134
SHARON: It's almost like
the island calls to you.

41:09.167 --> 41:12.704
And even after you leave it,

41:12.738 --> 41:16.575
you have this longing desire
to go back.

41:16.608 --> 41:19.545
There he is. Hey, Daniel!

41:19.578 --> 41:22.180
DAN B.: Anyone that has spent
as much time

41:22.213 --> 41:24.282
on the island as myself,

41:24.315 --> 41:27.252
they would like to be the one
that made the breakthrough.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.120
But you have to

41:29.154 --> 41:32.991
be willing to accept
a 17, 18-year-old kid

41:33.024 --> 41:34.926
could come in
and make a breakthrough.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.928
That's life.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.196
Good.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.765
Look what it says on that pipe.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.232
"Dan's breakthrough."

41:43.101 --> 41:45.270
It's transcendent, if you will.

41:45.303 --> 41:48.206
Because there's
this commonality of search...

41:48.239 --> 41:51.242
GARY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:51.276 --> 41:53.078
RICK: ...of attaining
a common goal...

41:53.111 --> 41:55.113
-That's a cross.
-That's a cross.

41:55.146 --> 41:59.618
...that it's easy to feel
like they're a part of us

41:59.651 --> 42:02.287
and we're a part of them.
