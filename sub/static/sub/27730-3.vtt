WEBVTT

00:13.100 --> 00:15.537
Michael Burnham.Ash Tyler.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.451
TILLY:
You got to give him

00:16.494 --> 00:17.365
a sign that you're interested.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.497
BURNHAM:
All my life

00:19.541 --> 00:22.239
the conflict inside me has been between logic and emotion.

00:22.283 --> 00:25.373
You remind me
of everything good.You are my tether.

00:25.416 --> 00:28.724
TYLER: A Klingon took
an interest in me.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.334
It's you.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.077
L'RELL:
We modified Voq into a shell

00:34.121 --> 00:35.600
that appears human.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.776
We grafted his psyche
into Tyler's.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.865
An activated Klingon spy.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.999
When I look at you now,
I see Voq's eyes.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.089
Was there ever really an
Ash Tyler? I loved him.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.700
They've planted a bomb in
the heart of your home world.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.006
Use the fate of Kronos

00:50.050 --> 00:51.181
to bend them to your will.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.884
I'm going with her.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.713
I'm gonna miss looking at you.I see you, Ash.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.064
In your eyes.

01:17.990 --> 01:22.169
BURNHAM:
Stardate 1029.46.

01:22.212 --> 01:25.520
Personal log,
Commander Michael Burnham.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.830
Any rational explanation
for the seven signals

01:31.874 --> 01:36.226
that have appeared across the
galaxy continues to escape me.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.315
And with it,
perhaps any chance

01:38.359 --> 01:40.839
of a relationship
with my brother Spock.

01:43.407 --> 01:46.062
What did he see in them
that I can't?

01:50.414 --> 01:53.417
My failure to understand feels
like a failure to reach him

01:53.461 --> 01:55.941
at a time
when he might need me most.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.814
COMPUTER: Attention: trainee
half-marathon approaching.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.555
TILLY:
On your left!

02:06.517 --> 02:07.997
MAY: Hi. Hello.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.781
Hi. It's me! Hello.

02:09.825 --> 02:10.695
It's me.It's me!

02:10.739 --> 02:12.044
Silly Stilly.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.701
You're not really there.
You're not.

02:16.745 --> 02:19.139
You're dead. You're dead.
You're not really here.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.792
Of course I am,
Silly Stilly.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.230
Where did you come from?

02:23.273 --> 02:25.580
And how come
they don't see you?Only you can.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.277
Why? Why me?Don't you remember?

02:27.321 --> 02:28.887
I'm May from junior high.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.716
I'm May... from junior high.
We were friends.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.632
You're the nicest person I've
ever met at this awful school.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.243
I went to that school
for six months.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.940
And then
my mother got another post,

02:37.983 --> 02:41.291
and we moved away, and you and I
have not spoken since then.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.293
And another thing.

02:43.337 --> 02:46.166
You died... years ago.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.342
Is that why you're upset?
Is that why you're upset?

02:48.385 --> 02:51.127
I'm upset because you are
a symptom of an unfit mind,

02:51.171 --> 02:53.782
and I can't have that right now.
I just can't.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.978
Oh, my...

03:16.021 --> 03:18.763
The Command Training Program's
half-marathon has a victor.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.591
A lovely show

03:20.635 --> 03:23.768
of endurance and fortitude,
Tilly. All right.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.596
You are dismissed, everyone,
but we will reconvene

03:25.640 --> 03:27.642
later in the day
for Shadow Exercises.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.818
MAY:
We won!

03:31.820 --> 03:34.388
There is no one else
I would rather cheer on

03:34.431 --> 03:35.824
and support and help.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.608
Causing a nervous breakdown
is not helping me.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.175
BURNHAM:
Tilly.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.742
SARU: ...set a new
course record.

03:40.785 --> 03:43.005
She also achieved...

03:43.048 --> 03:45.964
Saru says you not only won,
you beat your personal best.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.228
See? That's how
I'm helping you.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.881
What a team we are!

03:49.925 --> 03:52.797
It's all that training
you put me through.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.060
Thank you, Michael.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.280
I've got to go,
but congratulations.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.586
You're amazing.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.196
Saru, wait up.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.985
COMPUTER:
Yellow Alert.

04:07.029 --> 04:08.900
Undeclared craft
on an intercept course.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.902
Bearing
three-five-eight mark zero.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.078
Range-- 9,000 kilometers
and closing fast.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.167
No other propulsion
signatures in the sector.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.735
Hailing on all frequencies, sir.
So far they haven't responded.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.477
Tell them if they get any closer
without telling us who they are,

04:20.521 --> 04:22.305
we will activate
tactical systems.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.829
Aye, Captain.Owo, got anything on scans?

04:24.873 --> 04:27.354
Detecting a small ship.
Two life-forms.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.834
BRYCE: Captain, they've
opened up a channel.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.707
It's a private vessel with
a diplomatic registry number.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.926
They aren't required
to tell us more than that.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.841
The captain's asking me
to beam one aboard.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.321
They're now in range
for a visual, Captain.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.280
On screen.OWOSEKUN:
Aye, Captain.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.414
That ship is Vulcan.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.807
That ship is Sarek's.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.112
I recognize it.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.853
He assembled
a Federation

04:48.897 --> 04:50.551
task force to study
the seven signals.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.987
He might have
some news for us.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.729
He may want to discuss
something else.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.426
I reported Spock's
advance knowledge

04:56.470 --> 04:58.820
of the signals to Command.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.823
The information likely made
its way back to the ambassador,

05:01.866 --> 05:03.955
along with the news that
his son admitted himself

05:03.999 --> 05:06.218
into a psychiatric hospital.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.917
You didn't betray
your friend, Captain.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.093
You followed protocol.

05:11.136 --> 05:14.662
It's easy to say,
harder to believe.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.925
Have you heard from Spock's
doctors on Starbase Five?

05:17.752 --> 05:19.275
No, not yet.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.713
Report to the Transporter Room,
Commander.

05:22.757 --> 05:25.150
Welcome the Vulcan
ambassador aboard.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.109
Yes, sir.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.938
Deck four.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.420
MAN :
Boarding confirmed.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.812
Transporter lock established.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.597
Energize.Aye, Commander.

05:45.823 --> 05:48.086
Amanda?

05:54.005 --> 05:56.094
Please don't react.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.967
Spock needs our help.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.012
I could only turn to you.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.894
Will you make this human our new
fleet captain, too, Chancellor?

08:23.938 --> 08:29.160
Perhaps we should speak in
their standard tongue, too?

08:29.204 --> 08:31.554
Whatever language you prefer,
the truth remains

08:31.598 --> 08:36.385
the same: the Torchbearer was
anointed by T'Kuvma himself.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.518
You mean Voq was.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.694
If you want whatever

08:40.737 --> 08:44.785
this is as your plaything,
he belongs in your bed,

08:44.828 --> 08:47.004
not here.
L'RELL:
He belongs

08:47.048 --> 08:49.093
wherever I am.

08:49.137 --> 08:52.009
Just like
the allied Klingon houses,

08:52.053 --> 08:55.012
our union is
what makes us strong.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.799
Your old way of thinking kept us
at each other's throats.

08:58.842 --> 09:02.498
Remove the paint
from your face, Kol-Sha.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.587
We are oneculture now.

09:04.631 --> 09:08.722
Your unionis an insult
to my son Kol,

09:08.765 --> 09:12.029
and all our sons
who died by human treachery.

09:12.073 --> 09:15.119
This is no
coincidence,

09:15.163 --> 09:18.079
those seven red lights
appeared from the sky

09:18.122 --> 09:20.864
so soon after she took power.

09:22.518 --> 09:26.043
They are an omen!

09:26.087 --> 09:29.612
Seven drops of blood
ready to rain down on us.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.005
Remove the paint.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.629
Your chancellor doesn't
get her hands dirty.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.631
That's the Torchbearer's job,

09:48.675 --> 09:53.723
whether he be human,
Klingon or both.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.642
You know about
the seven signals?

09:59.686 --> 10:02.123
Yes. Sarek informed me.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.168
People are anxious to
know what they are.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.127
MAN :
Attention all cadets.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.694
Duty log has been updated...

10:07.737 --> 10:09.304
Spock's connected to them.

10:09.347 --> 10:12.263
How?He left a log claiming

10:12.307 --> 10:15.832
that he saw them long before
they appeared to the Federation.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.705
But until we can speak to
him, we have no answers,

10:18.748 --> 10:21.751
and I don't know
what else to do.

10:21.795 --> 10:24.493
I have no new angles
to investigate.

10:24.536 --> 10:27.452
Except... the one
I'm giving you.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.194
I just came
from Starbase Five.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.849
I went to the psychiatric unit.

10:32.893 --> 10:36.157
They wouldn't tell me
where he was.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.680
They wouldn't let me see him.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.203
They wouldn't say
what was wrong with him.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.205
Thy wouldn't even give me
his personal effects.

10:41.249 --> 10:44.382
You're his next of kin, and
you're a diplomat's wife.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.950
So I did the only
logical thing.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.431
I stole his medical file.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.479
It's encrypted.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.307
Can you please open it?

10:56.351 --> 10:58.396
Mother.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.311
Please.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.684
How was your walk?

11:24.727 --> 11:26.033
I have dedicated everything
to your cause.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.252
The least your uncle could do
is acknowledge me.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.385
He and the rest of House Mo'Kai
believe in you.

11:30.428 --> 11:33.127
We have enemies enough.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.172
There is no need
to dream up imaginary ones.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.524
Kol-Sha is telling
council members

11:39.568 --> 11:41.222
that you are advising me

11:41.265 --> 11:43.224
to eliminate the
great houses entirely.

11:43.267 --> 11:47.532
My uncle is disseminating the
truth to counteract his lies.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.797
He looks at me
and sees a human. They all do.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.408
You should not care what anyone
sees when they look at you.

11:53.451 --> 11:56.106
On that subject, only
my opinion matters.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.024
Why do you insist on
speaking English to me?

12:01.068 --> 12:02.547
I'm not a human, L'Rell.

12:02.591 --> 12:05.246
I'm a Klingon whose body was
changed to resemble one.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.249
If we expect others to
acknowledge my Klingon side--

12:08.292 --> 12:10.860
accept me as the Torchbearer--
you must treat me like Voq.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.611
If you are Voq,
then want me back.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.179
Want me.

12:36.190 --> 12:39.280
You touch me...

12:39.323 --> 12:41.630
and that intimacy,

12:41.673 --> 12:45.634
to me, Tyler, feels like...

12:47.288 --> 12:49.812
...violation.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.609
AMANDA: Spock speaks highly
of you, Captain Pike.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.176
Now my daughter does, too,

13:06.220 --> 13:07.830
so I know I've come
to the right people.

13:07.874 --> 13:12.226
Well, ma'am, that makes it all
the harder for me to tell you...

13:12.269 --> 13:14.794
I can't open this file.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.839
If I did, I'd be in violation
of the rules,

13:16.883 --> 13:18.362
and my mother
wouldn't like that.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.669
There is precedent
in Starfleet case law

13:20.712 --> 13:21.975
for a captain to invoke...

13:22.018 --> 13:23.411
Was she this bossy as a kid?

13:23.454 --> 13:25.935
On Vulcan, we call it
"persistent." And yes, she was.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.937
She learned that from me.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.375
Hmm.

13:34.030 --> 13:37.468
Bryce, get me Captain Vela
on Starbase Five.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.166
Tell him it's high priority.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.428
BRYCE:
Yes, sir.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.303
Ah.
Chris.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.610
You and my Bisabuela Nena
are the only two people

13:48.653 --> 13:51.134
in this quadrant still
communicating on screens.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.570
Well, your grandma sounds like
a smart lady.

13:52.614 --> 13:53.920
You should introduce us.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.530
Sorry I haven't returned
your call.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.314
"Calls," Diego.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.273
I've been waiting for
an update on my officer, Spock.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.709
VELA: I'm sorry,
I can't give you one.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.798
His case is classified.

14:02.842 --> 14:07.324
I'm well within my rights as
his captain to get a prognosis.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.370
Even if that weren't the case,
Spock has information

14:09.413 --> 14:11.589
on the signals I was assigned
to investigate.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.461
Starfleet declared my mission
priority one.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.855
The signals have nothing to do
with it, Chris.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.118
Your guy is wanted for murder.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.121
He killed three of his doctors,
then fled the starbase.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.513
PIKE: Why isn't word out
about his escape

14:22.557 --> 14:24.428
so that every starship
can be on the hunt?

14:24.472 --> 14:27.910
VELA: Elements of the case
just got complicated.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.303
Some of Spock's files
are missing.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.435
We have no idea how.

14:31.479 --> 14:35.439
Rest assured
they've got people on it.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.658
PIKE:
Thanks, Vela.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.790
Pike out.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.706
It's not true.

14:41.750 --> 14:46.494
My son is gentle and kind;

14:46.537 --> 14:49.323
he wouldn't do that.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.891
I agree, Captain.

14:51.934 --> 14:56.156
Well, that makes three of us.

14:56.199 --> 15:00.638
But I don't think the "people"
handling his case would concur.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.337
Our boy's in trouble.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.686
Whatever happened,
he needs a fair shake.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.383
We need to find him
before they do.

15:06.427 --> 15:10.431
Burnham, break into Mr. Spock's
medical file.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.563
That's an order.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.571
Lieutenant Spock's
intellectual abilities

15:20.615 --> 15:23.661
and capacity for reason
are intact.

15:23.705 --> 15:27.665
Instead, his dissociation
appears acutely emotional.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.059
E.Q. tests and his current
disaffected state

15:30.103 --> 15:33.062
suggest extreme
empathy deficits.

15:37.937 --> 15:42.550
I'll transfer the rest of
the files, and then...

15:42.593 --> 15:44.508
we can decide the
best place to start.

15:44.552 --> 15:48.686
Your wheels are
already turning.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.688
Logic dictates
a few theories:

15:50.732 --> 15:53.778
Spock didn't do it and
he's wrongfully accused;

15:53.822 --> 15:57.608
or he did murder those doctors
in a mentally compromised state,

15:57.652 --> 16:01.569
or in what he thought
was self-defense.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.964
Or...He did it because he's
emotionally compromised.

16:06.791 --> 16:10.926
"Extreme empathy deficit"

16:10.970 --> 16:14.408
is code for psychopathy.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.672
I can't deny
that possibility.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.631
He didn't have
a normal childhood.

16:20.675 --> 16:26.159
Sarek wanted Spock raised
in the Vulcan manner.

16:26.202 --> 16:30.554
And any display of emotion
was strongly discouraged.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.557
And in order not
to confuse my son,

16:33.601 --> 16:35.646
I began to hide my own.

16:35.690 --> 16:41.261
I was not a real mother...

16:43.785 --> 16:45.830
I wasn't what he needed.

16:45.874 --> 16:49.095
You gave us love every second.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.622
It was different
with you, Michael.

16:54.665 --> 16:59.496
I gave you all my joy...

16:59.540 --> 17:02.499
and my affection

17:02.543 --> 17:05.850
that I was not permitted
to give to him.

17:05.894 --> 17:09.506
But Spock is half human.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.726
If he had been permitted
to embrace the feelings

17:11.769 --> 17:14.163
that I know he has
inside of him,

17:14.207 --> 17:18.385
it would've saved him from all
the trouble that he's in now.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.490
Stop.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.840
Stop.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.668
Those images.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.713
Spock drew them.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.411
I'm sure of it.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.152
He must've...

17:46.195 --> 17:48.197
done them when he was
in treatment.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.678
I thought that he left it
in the past.

17:50.721 --> 17:54.769
But it's back.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.858
What is it?

17:56.901 --> 18:00.122
Your brother called it
the Red Angel.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.777
He started seeing it
when he was a little boy.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.692
It changed him.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.136
I'm sorry.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.573
I have to answer this.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.625
Michael.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.714
Thanks for answering.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.542
Of course.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.109
Are you all right?
Is L'Rell?

18:30.152 --> 18:32.502
For now. She's
still in power

18:32.546 --> 18:35.114
but her opponents continue to
challenge and discredit her.

18:35.157 --> 18:38.073
It's volatile.How can I help?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.683
The Federation needs to be aware
of the situation.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.511
If L'Rell falls,
peace falls with her.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.339
I'll pass it up the chain
of command immediately.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.820
Thanks.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.127
I should go.Wait.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.261
What?

18:52.305 --> 18:55.699
I...

18:55.743 --> 18:57.745
I don't know.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.226
I like the beard.

19:02.532 --> 19:06.928
I heard, postwar, the Klingons
are growing their hair again.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.974
The rumors are true.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.802
How are you?

19:11.846 --> 19:14.196
I've been dealing with
some things

19:14.240 --> 19:16.067
regarding my foster brother.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.765
I thought I hit a dead end

19:17.808 --> 19:20.028
but Amanda came and got me
back on track.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.465
Can you ship her over here
when you're done with her?

19:22.509 --> 19:24.424
I'm feeling a little stuck,
myself.

19:24.467 --> 19:28.036
You've got me, right now.

19:33.041 --> 19:37.524
I understood my role here,
to aid L'Rell.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.963
But I'm afraid I'm hurting her.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.704
I'm an easy target
for the old guard.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.227
What does L'Rell think?

19:45.271 --> 19:47.490
That their opposition
is part of the fight,

19:47.534 --> 19:51.233
and their ignorance will be
their downfall.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.716
You admire her.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.283
I do.

19:57.326 --> 20:01.025
It sounds like she feels
the same way about you,

20:01.069 --> 20:03.811
and values having you there.

20:03.854 --> 20:06.944
Try to take her at her word.

20:12.298 --> 20:17.259
It's, uh, it's late here, so...

20:17.303 --> 20:18.869
Take care of yourself, Michael.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.698
You, too, Ash.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.312
Yeah.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.622
Greetings, everyone,

20:32.666 --> 20:34.711
and welcome to Shadow Exercises.

20:34.755 --> 20:38.019
As Starfleet's future chiefs
and captains,

20:38.062 --> 20:40.064
this is your opportunity

20:40.108 --> 20:42.415
to build rapport
with a senior officer,

20:42.458 --> 20:46.941
and see firsthand
what their duties entail.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.899
So let us begin.

20:48.943 --> 20:49.944
PIKE:
Look sharp, people.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.772
This is our future competition.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.643
Is that your captain?

20:53.687 --> 20:55.776
Um, Ensign Sylvia Tilly, sir.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.299
Fully present and
utterly focused

20:57.343 --> 20:58.866
on this very
important exercise

20:58.909 --> 21:00.476
for which I am
all ears, Captain.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.130
Your dedication
is noted, Ensign.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.306
So, what should we do?

21:04.350 --> 21:06.047
How 'bout we marry some folks,

21:06.090 --> 21:07.875
even if they're not that
into each other, hmm?

21:07.918 --> 21:10.094
Oh, very good, sir.

21:10.138 --> 21:12.271
Captain. I need your
authorization for this.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.316
I don't understand.
That was funny.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.101
The captain of this ship
isn't funny, he's terrifying.

21:17.145 --> 21:20.017
You may be thinking of an old
captain, Captain Lorca.

21:20.061 --> 21:21.802
Was he shorter?
And blonder?

21:21.845 --> 21:24.326
And much, much whiter? Because
that's who I'm looking for.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.328
: 'Cause that's who
I'm looking for.PIKE: I'm ready if you are.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.025
He's not the man
I need to talk to.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.810
PIKE: Hop in
the chair, Ensign.Yes, sir.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.202
Let's run a systems test.

21:31.246 --> 21:32.682
Where is the other captain?

21:32.726 --> 21:34.293
Uh, a systems test.
Uh, where?

21:34.336 --> 21:37.687
Where? In the chair.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.603
Oh. S-Sorry.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.605
Run checklist protocol.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.868
Acknowledged. Uh, step one.

21:44.912 --> 21:47.001
Tilly, this is not right.
My plan is falling apart.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.437
Calm down.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.047
I'm hearing considerably
fewer syllables

21:50.091 --> 21:51.310
out of you than normal.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.702
I-I know the chair
can be intimidating,

21:52.746 --> 21:54.356
but are you okay?

21:54.400 --> 21:58.055
No. We are not okay.
I want the captain.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.579
I want the captain.This is the captain.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.668
Ensign, what is going on?

22:02.973 --> 22:04.671
Tilly, answer Captain Pike.

22:04.714 --> 22:05.672
Tilly...
No.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.108
I'm not listening to you
anymore.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.153
You tricked me
and you lied to me.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.720
I didn't lie. He's lying.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.331
He's an imposter.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.767
Shut up!

22:13.810 --> 22:15.508
Ensign Sylvia Tilly!

22:15.551 --> 22:18.685
No. I didn't.
I'm sor-- I w--

22:18.728 --> 22:19.990
She drove me to it. I...

22:20.034 --> 22:22.036
That doesn't make any sense.
I'm s...

22:22.079 --> 22:22.950
I'm not...

22:22.993 --> 22:25.126
I'm not...

22:25.169 --> 22:26.954
I'm not.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.222
I quit.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.447
You were spying on me.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.449
Your mind plays tricks.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.929
What do you have
against me?

23:28.972 --> 23:30.626
Why do you stop speaking
when I enter a room?

23:30.670 --> 23:33.150
You'll speak now
or I'll slit your throat.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.675
If you feel aggrieved,

23:35.718 --> 23:37.546
take it up with my niece.

23:37.590 --> 23:41.376
It is not House Mo'Kai that
is keeping secrets from you.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.205
What secrets?

23:45.815 --> 23:48.470
L'Rell will be angry

23:48.514 --> 23:51.473
I broke her trust,

23:51.517 --> 23:55.390
but I cannot keep this
from you any longer.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.251
UJILLI:
Behold,

24:30.294 --> 24:34.124
the son of L'Rell and Voq.

24:56.451 --> 24:59.323
I learned I was pregnant
right as Voq

24:59.367 --> 25:02.239
was being transformed
into a human.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.241
I could not activate him
on Discovery

25:04.285 --> 25:06.156
while carrying a child.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.681
The gestation
occurred ex-utero.

25:08.724 --> 25:12.336
That is why
it is so small.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.210
"It"?

25:16.253 --> 25:18.560
Does he even have a name?No.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.736
I have never met
the child.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.130
The baby is a vulnerability.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.741
He's just a vulnerability
to you?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.438
All these secrets and lies

25:27.482 --> 25:29.571
to protect
a failed wartime mission.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.530
What did you gain, L'Rell?

25:31.573 --> 25:33.314
You think your discovery,
made moments ago,

25:33.357 --> 25:34.794
is somehow greater

25:34.837 --> 25:38.580
than the pain I have lived with
all this time?

25:41.191 --> 25:42.584
Would you have
ever told me?

25:42.628 --> 25:44.586
I wanted you
to be able to return

25:44.630 --> 25:47.589
to a human life
without obligation.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.983
You will not be here forever,
Tyler.

25:50.026 --> 25:52.289
Why do say that?
With such certainty,

25:52.333 --> 25:54.248
like you know who I am better
than I do?

25:54.291 --> 25:55.728
I chose to be here.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.556
I'm committed
to that decision.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.558
Why did you call
Michael Burnham?

26:01.255 --> 26:03.953
I trusted her to notify the
Federation that an insurrection

26:03.997 --> 26:05.346
of the High Council
might be brewing.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.609
So she is the only one
you trust.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.525
That is the only reason
it was that

26:10.569 --> 26:13.093
particular human woman?

26:13.136 --> 26:15.095
Yes.

26:15.138 --> 26:17.401
That is the reason.

26:23.625 --> 26:27.542
On my way home, I looked
into one of Voq's memories.

26:27.586 --> 26:31.067
You and he walked across the
ancestral cliffs of the Mo'Kai.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.329
The sun set.

26:32.373 --> 26:34.723
The sky dripped
amethysts.

26:34.767 --> 26:38.597
Our love was greater than that
of Kahless and Lukara's.

26:41.469 --> 26:44.907
Voq thought so, too.

26:44.951 --> 26:48.607
When I stared down
at that baby...

26:48.650 --> 26:51.305
his skin, the same as Voq's,

26:51.348 --> 26:53.307
the distinction that made
him feel like an outsider,

26:53.350 --> 26:54.482
that made his
life so hard,

26:54.525 --> 26:56.702
I felt like I was looking
at myself.

26:56.745 --> 27:00.009
For the first time,
the two sides of me felt whole.

27:00.053 --> 27:01.663
I can't be Voq.

27:01.707 --> 27:05.319
I can't give you back
those memories of long ago.

27:05.362 --> 27:07.800
But I can promise you
a new love story.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.367
I am his father,

27:10.411 --> 27:13.240
and I am
devoted to you.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.895
Let's bring our son home.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.723
The rest will come.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.127
When did it
first appear to him?

27:32.085 --> 27:34.696
It appeared to Spock

27:34.740 --> 27:37.351
the night you
ran away from home.

27:37.394 --> 27:40.397
The Logic Extremists had
bombed the Learning Center

27:40.441 --> 27:42.791
and almost killed you.
I don't blame you

27:42.835 --> 27:45.925
for wanting to escape
from Vulcan to Earth.

27:45.968 --> 27:49.450
I didn't make it past
the outskirts of ShiKahr.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.453
I still don't know
how Sarek found me.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.498
He didn't.

27:54.542 --> 27:55.848
That was Spock.

27:55.891 --> 27:59.155
We were about to alert
the High Command

27:59.199 --> 28:02.463
to begin a search effort,

28:02.506 --> 28:04.944
and Spock walked
into the room.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.293
He was still
in his pajamas.

28:06.336 --> 28:08.295
His eyes were wide,
and he said

28:08.338 --> 28:12.125
that the Red Angel
had visited him

28:12.168 --> 28:14.431
and told him where you were.

28:16.172 --> 28:17.434
That's where Sarek looked,

28:17.478 --> 28:18.653
and there you were.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.747
Sarek and I
always believed

28:25.791 --> 28:28.141
that Spock used logic

28:28.184 --> 28:30.230
to pinpoint
your direction.

28:30.273 --> 28:32.449
He might have known
what time you left,

28:32.493 --> 28:34.974
how fast you were walking, what
direction you were going in.

28:35.017 --> 28:38.499
And we just wrote the vision off
as a figment of his imagination.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.849
But Spock never wavered.

28:40.893 --> 28:43.852
He said
that the Red Angel was real.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.205
I've seen this angel, too.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.468
It appeared to me on our
mission to the first signal.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.470
Were you the only one?

28:53.514 --> 28:55.472
Yes.

28:55.516 --> 28:59.172
And I wrote it off
as a trick of the mind.

28:59.215 --> 29:03.611
And I didn't get the sense
that it was nefarious.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.660
I cannot believe
I'm talking like this.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.924
I'm not even sure it was real.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.447
It is.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.362
What saved you

29:15.405 --> 29:17.059
hurt your brother.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.366
That vision changed him forever.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.497
I...

29:20.541 --> 29:21.847
I watched him withdraw.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.850
I saw him lose trust
in other people.

29:24.893 --> 29:29.332
I watched
his openness vanish.

29:30.464 --> 29:33.162
It wasn't because of a vision.

29:35.643 --> 29:38.428
It was because of me.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.996
My presence was a
danger to the family.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.868
If the Logic Extremists
couldn't get to me,

29:42.911 --> 29:45.696
they would try to get to him.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.569
And he was my little shadow.

29:48.612 --> 29:52.268
So I had to wound him deep
enough to keep him away from me.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.794
What did you do?

30:01.582 --> 30:03.497
The fact that you're
not saying anything means

30:03.540 --> 30:06.717
that you must have hurt him
irreparably.

30:06.761 --> 30:09.633
Which is why the four of us
can never get together,

30:09.677 --> 30:12.462
which is why you're always
too busy to see each other.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.988
I'm sorry.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.599
I am sorry for what I did.

30:20.035 --> 30:23.038
What I thought I had to do.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.521
I've reached out

30:27.564 --> 30:29.001
so many times

30:29.044 --> 30:31.699
to make amends.

30:35.659 --> 30:38.532
He's not interested.

30:41.230 --> 30:44.451
But I won't give up on him.

30:44.494 --> 30:47.715
I will find him.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.068
No.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.679
I will.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.263
He will not know me.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.092
He didn't know me either.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.185
Uncle.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.756
No, no!

31:31.715 --> 31:34.762
I've been awaiting
your arrival.

31:34.805 --> 31:37.112
Your son is handsome.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.810
But I thought
he could use...

31:39.854 --> 31:41.812
a little color.

31:41.856 --> 31:44.206
I will hunt you down
and rip out your entrails

31:44.250 --> 31:46.948
with my bare hands.Doubtful.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.690
The paint I begged you
to wipe from my face

31:49.733 --> 31:51.779
was swimming
with sensor implants.

31:51.822 --> 31:54.434
They are a
listening device.

31:54.477 --> 31:59.352
I was only hoping to eavesdrop
on your political strategies.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.397
But I never imagined

32:01.441 --> 32:03.530
I'd learn of this.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.662
The High Council
will not tolerate

32:05.706 --> 32:07.621
this dishonor.Well, I think

32:07.664 --> 32:10.189
they are more likely
to condone kidnapping

32:10.232 --> 32:12.452
than harboring a spy.

32:12.495 --> 32:15.803
Your pet betrayed the council
to Commander Burnham.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.674
Did he not?

32:18.719 --> 32:21.243
What do you want?

32:21.287 --> 32:25.117
I'm willing to part with him
and let you flee

32:25.160 --> 32:29.904
in exchange for control
of the empire.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.515
You will agree to
my terms and meet me

32:32.559 --> 32:34.822
at your residence.

32:46.573 --> 32:49.532
Saru called down
looking for you.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.665
You all right?

32:51.708 --> 32:53.058
What's wrong?
Have you been crying?

32:53.101 --> 32:55.712
I asked first.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.156
Talk to me.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.245
I need a problem
I can solve.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.290
More than you know.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.858
Talk to me.
Haven't I been punished enough?

33:10.901 --> 33:13.252
What happened up there
was upsetting to me.

33:13.295 --> 33:14.775
I panicked.

33:14.818 --> 33:15.776
Tilly?

33:15.819 --> 33:17.038
Tilly.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.213
Don't ruin what we have.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.214
We're not defeated yet.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.087
We're not defeated yet.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.568
After the dark matter hit me,

33:25.612 --> 33:28.136
I s...

33:28.180 --> 33:31.444
I started to see a...

33:31.487 --> 33:33.794
ghost.

33:33.837 --> 33:36.579
She's a girl that I knew
when I was a teenager.

33:36.623 --> 33:39.278
Her name was May.
But she's dead.

33:39.321 --> 33:42.498
And the May that I knew
was really meek and, uh...

33:42.542 --> 33:45.066
kind of goofy when
you got to know her.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.676
But this May
is different.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.070
She's, um... she's insistent.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.724
She's grooming me
for something.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.030
For what?

33:52.073 --> 33:53.509
She hasn't said.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.641
Because you're ignoring me.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.643
And I'm getting scared.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.297
And we need
a new plan.

34:00.560 --> 34:03.650
I am losing it, Michael.

34:03.693 --> 34:06.740
She's wearing me down.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.872
I've been avoiding sickbay.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.179
But, at this point,
I don't know what to do.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.963
I'm desperate.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.618
And after today, I'm
never gonna make captain.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.925
MAY:
Your eyes are dripping.

34:17.968 --> 34:21.407
'Cause I'm crying.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.367
She doesn't know what crying is.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.152
I've got to think.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.938
I'll be back to talk
some sense into you later.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.638
She left.

34:35.682 --> 34:39.425
How can she not know
what tears are?

34:39.468 --> 34:42.123
That's impossible.

34:42.167 --> 34:45.039
Show me a teenage girl
who's never cried.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.085
You can't.

34:47.128 --> 34:50.653
I know.
I'm a xenoanthropologist.

34:52.873 --> 34:57.617
And if May were a hallucination
pulled from your subconscious,

34:57.660 --> 35:00.098
then she'd know that emotion,
because you know that emotion.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.449
So May is something, Tilly.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.451
But I don't think she's a ghost.

35:05.494 --> 35:08.018
Or a delusion.

35:08.062 --> 35:12.153
You said she appeared to you
after the asteroid shocked you.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.763
But why did it shock you?

35:13.807 --> 35:15.548
I held a piece in my hand,

35:15.591 --> 35:17.767
and I wasn't zapped.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.335
The dark matter component
of the asteroid,

35:20.379 --> 35:23.251
it reacts when it's
in proximity to one thing.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.123
Spores.

35:25.166 --> 35:28.430
You don't need
sickbay.

35:28.474 --> 35:31.129
You need Stamets.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.879
Sign.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.143
I am still your chancellor.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.884
You are the
Federation's puppet.

35:47.928 --> 35:49.973
Why is she such
a threat to you, Kol-Sha?

35:51.018 --> 35:52.541
The female?

35:52.585 --> 35:54.674
She's nothing but a...

35:56.937 --> 35:59.679
that lies with a human.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.203
If that is the gravest
insult you can hurl,

36:02.247 --> 36:04.901
you are even less
than I imagined.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.122
L'RELL: I know

36:08.166 --> 36:10.994
I am nothing to you
once I have signed,

36:11.038 --> 36:13.171
so be sure
to kill us both, Kol-Sha.

36:13.214 --> 36:16.609
The one left standing will be
the one who returns for you.

37:46.699 --> 37:47.787
Enough.

37:53.183 --> 37:57.275
KOL-SHA:
Yes. Feel it.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.754
Paralysis...

37:58.798 --> 38:02.889
is spreading to your organs.

38:02.932 --> 38:05.108
But I will not
let you suffocate

38:05.152 --> 38:07.241
until you've signed.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.899
Thank you for my ink.

38:12.942 --> 38:15.989
Now pass me that

38:16.032 --> 38:19.340
pretty little finger.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.782
Now...

38:26.826 --> 38:30.786
for my first act
as chancellor:

38:30.830 --> 38:33.528
an execution.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.356
Now...

38:35.400 --> 38:37.010
you can watch

38:37.053 --> 38:39.099
your Voq die...

38:39.142 --> 38:41.188
for good.

38:46.585 --> 38:49.239
KOL-SHA:
What is that?

39:32.587 --> 39:34.328
TYLER: Why have you
been spying on me?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.374
GEORGIOU: Don't be cranky
about it. We have to ensure

39:36.417 --> 39:38.680
that she stays
in the chancellor's seat.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.900
Who's "we"?

39:40.943 --> 39:42.336
Emperor...

39:42.380 --> 39:45.818
: You have me confused
with someone else.

39:45.861 --> 39:48.255
I'm Philippa Georgiou,

39:48.298 --> 39:51.519
retired captain
of the U.S.S. Shenzhou,

39:51.563 --> 39:54.609
now Starfleet
security consultant.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.613
: Oh, children
are parasites.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.441
Ungrateful.
Inconvenient.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.182
I had to find
someone else

40:02.225 --> 40:05.620
to feed mine, or I would
have gotten nothing done.

40:05.664 --> 40:08.231
I will consider
that advice.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.713
Thank you for your help.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.367
Gratitude is
premature,

40:13.411 --> 40:16.849
as long as the disemboweled
leader of House Kor

40:16.892 --> 40:19.155
is splattered on your floor.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.114
TYLER: He took our child,
tried to force her to abdicate.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.637
We were defending
ourselves.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.770
Kol-Sha killed your uncle--
it's an eye for an eye.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.902
I need a word
with the chancellor.

40:31.646 --> 40:35.215
Every minute you remain here,
your councilors must reorganize

40:35.258 --> 40:37.260
their tiny male brains

40:37.304 --> 40:41.787
to rationalize why it isn't them
standing on the dais.

40:41.830 --> 40:45.443
They will assume that
all your decisions are Tyler's.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.184
He is a liability.

40:48.228 --> 40:50.273
Can you kill him?

40:52.493 --> 40:55.235
I had to ask.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.237
He is a liability, too.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.500
You can't show weakness

40:59.544 --> 41:01.850
when it comes
to either one of them.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.983
I will not choose
between the chancellorship

41:04.026 --> 41:05.811
and my son and his father.

41:05.854 --> 41:09.249
I told you what
I am here to protect.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.775
I am not giving you a choice.

41:18.345 --> 41:21.304
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.916
I am sorry, too.

41:23.959 --> 41:25.352
But thanks
to Burnham's insights,

41:25.395 --> 41:27.006
we are closer
to finding a solution.

41:27.049 --> 41:31.010
And... getting you back into
the Command Training Program.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.361
What about Captain Pike?

41:34.404 --> 41:37.669
I am not familiar
enough with the captain
to anticipate his reaction,

41:37.712 --> 41:39.714
but I do know
that he has

41:39.758 --> 41:42.804
a sense of humor...
and that he is fond of you.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.197
STAMETS:
We should have results

41:44.240 --> 41:45.546
in one second.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.026
MAY: I told you

41:47.069 --> 41:49.507
he was shorter, blonder,

41:49.550 --> 41:51.378
whiter...
There he is.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.598
That's the captain.No, he's not.

41:53.641 --> 41:56.296
Yes, he is.
That's where he flies.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.341
What's going on?She's back and
she's pissed.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.342
Maybe at you.

41:59.386 --> 42:00.430
Please hurry.Stop talking

42:00.474 --> 42:01.954
to him until I tell
you what to say.

42:01.997 --> 42:03.912
STAMETS:
Just as I suspected.

42:03.956 --> 42:06.175
You are hosting a
eukaryotic organism.

42:06.219 --> 42:07.350
A fungus?Obviously

42:07.394 --> 42:08.438
multicellular,
since it has

42:08.482 --> 42:10.832
opinions.Fungus.

42:10.876 --> 42:12.268
Don't you dare
diminish...

42:12.312 --> 42:13.879
don't you dare
diminish me.

42:13.922 --> 42:15.445
SARU: Anyone who works
around the spore drive

42:15.489 --> 42:17.230
is inoculated--
how did she contract it?

42:17.273 --> 42:19.014
It's possible that
a spore evolved

42:19.058 --> 42:21.016
a resistance,
like bacteria.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.714
And don't you
call me bacteria.

42:22.757 --> 42:25.455
Or it's a different spore
altogether than the ones
we harvest here.

42:25.499 --> 42:28.807
When Discoveryescaped the
Terran universe, their spores

42:28.850 --> 42:30.504
rained down on Engineering.

42:32.158 --> 42:33.376
If one attached
itself to you...

42:39.644 --> 42:41.471
Hey, May.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.256
Is that her?

42:43.299 --> 42:46.172
He's the villain. Don't
let him poison you against me.

42:46.215 --> 42:47.260
STAMETS:
There's our hitchhiker.

42:47.303 --> 42:50.263
A multidimensional,
fungal parasite.

42:50.306 --> 42:52.613
Why does it appear to be someone
I knew when I was a teenager?

42:52.657 --> 42:54.354
Brain manipulation,
perhaps?

42:54.397 --> 42:56.182
These people are lying.

42:56.225 --> 42:58.358
I am not a
manipulator.

42:58.401 --> 43:00.839
You're special, Tilly.
You're my only chance.

43:00.882 --> 43:02.362
I need you.

43:04.886 --> 43:06.932
How do we get rid of it?

43:06.975 --> 43:09.325
We use the attraction
between the fungal spores

43:09.369 --> 43:12.372
and the dark matter asteroid
to suck her out of you.

43:12.415 --> 43:15.418
This might hurt a bit.

43:17.377 --> 43:19.335
If you think you
can destroy me, Captain,

43:19.379 --> 43:21.424
you're in for a fight!

43:38.441 --> 43:41.662
Security breach by unknown
alien species in Engineering.

43:41.706 --> 43:44.447
Engage quarantine protocol
Alpha-Omega.

44:03.510 --> 44:07.514
Such was the dishonor
he brought.

44:07.557 --> 44:11.866
Secretly, he communicated
with the Federation.

44:11.910 --> 44:16.566
He told them we are disunited
and therefore weak.

44:16.610 --> 44:19.700
He betrayed us.

44:19.744 --> 44:22.877
Lest anyone think
my arrangement with the human

44:22.921 --> 44:25.793
outweighs my loyalty
to the empire,

44:25.837 --> 44:27.926
think again.

44:33.540 --> 44:38.588
The traitor slaughtered
a Klingon infant.

44:38.632 --> 44:40.025
My son.

44:44.594 --> 44:46.771
L'RELL:
He would have assassinated
your chancellor

44:46.814 --> 44:49.425
had Kol-Sha not intervened.

44:49.469 --> 44:54.474
The leader of House Kor
gave his life to defend mine.

45:00.654 --> 45:03.396
One house defending another.

45:03.439 --> 45:07.356
His sacrifice is
a lesson to us all.

45:07.400 --> 45:10.490
I, too,
have sacrificed.

45:12.579 --> 45:16.975
I will bear a child but once.

45:20.979 --> 45:23.721
Now...

45:23.764 --> 45:25.331
you are my children,

45:25.374 --> 45:28.682
as I raise this family
to greatness!

45:28.726 --> 45:31.511
Do not refer to me

45:31.554 --> 45:32.512
as Chancellor,

45:32.555 --> 45:36.603
for I deserve a fiercer title.

45:36.646 --> 45:38.736
From this point forth,

45:38.779 --> 45:41.086
you may call me...

45:41.129 --> 45:42.827
Mother.

46:35.749 --> 46:37.403
You synthesized our heads

46:37.446 --> 46:39.666
down to their neural mapping
and genetic codes.

46:39.709 --> 46:41.886
This isn't your everyday
Federation espionage.

46:41.929 --> 46:45.019
What kind of organization
could pull that off?

46:45.063 --> 46:46.629
GEORGIOU:
This kind.

46:47.892 --> 46:50.546
Section 31.

46:50.590 --> 46:53.506
I've heard of black badges;
never seen one.

46:55.247 --> 46:57.205
We've settled into orbit
around Boreth.

46:57.249 --> 47:00.643
Are you sure you want
your boy to become a monk?

47:00.687 --> 47:03.124
It's what L'Rell wants.

47:03.168 --> 47:04.822
And you?

47:04.865 --> 47:07.737
To know where I belong,
and to whom,

47:07.781 --> 47:09.261
and who belongs to me.

47:09.304 --> 47:11.219
My son will be raised

47:11.263 --> 47:12.830
by the most devout
followers of Kahless.

47:12.873 --> 47:16.442
No one leaves the monastery,

47:16.485 --> 47:19.532
and no one who doesn't belong
ever gets in.

47:19.575 --> 47:21.360
Not even his parents?

47:21.403 --> 47:23.449
He'll never know me.

47:24.798 --> 47:27.235
Never know L'Rell, either.

47:27.279 --> 47:29.498
But he'll be safe.

47:36.157 --> 47:38.856
GEORGIOU: You should consider
staying around.

47:38.899 --> 47:41.902
Our command believes
misfits have merit,

47:41.946 --> 47:43.599
so we keep busy.

47:43.643 --> 47:46.994
I'm surprised you call
yourself a misfit, Emperor.

47:47.038 --> 47:49.605
The freaks are more fun.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.047
LELAND:
Take us to warp.

48:01.661 --> 48:04.925
CONTROL values
his skill set.

48:04.969 --> 48:08.581
We would like you to work
on your recruitment speech.

48:08.624 --> 48:09.930
Don't give me notes.

48:09.974 --> 48:11.540
He's in.
