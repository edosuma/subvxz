00:36.142 --> 00:37.482

00:37.584 --> 00:39.716
_

00:40.167 --> 00:43.737
In conclusion, the
challenges of the 21st century

00:43.738 --> 00:45.673
are indeed great.

00:45.674 --> 00:50.511
Therefore, our determination
to solve them together

00:50.512 --> 00:52.212
must be even greater.

00:52.213 --> 00:53.847
Thank you.

00:53.848 --> 00:55.490
And now I'm going to barf,

00:55.491 --> 00:58.526
because this speech is so terrible.

00:58.527 --> 01:00.462
No offense, Matt.

01:00.463 --> 01:02.297
None taken, I think.

01:02.298 --> 01:04.532
But given that this is my first speech

01:04.533 --> 01:06.468
before the World Affairs Committee,

01:06.469 --> 01:08.637
which is "the most
august and influential..."

01:08.638 --> 01:09.871
What was the rest of it?

01:09.872 --> 01:12.607
"Forum for international
relations in the world."

01:12.608 --> 01:14.142
Right, that.

01:14.143 --> 01:17.712
Wouldn't it be nice if I
actually... say something?

01:17.713 --> 01:19.981
Well, ma'am, it's precisely because

01:19.982 --> 01:23.585
this is your first speech
on such an important stage

01:23.586 --> 01:26.655
that each word needs to be
polished, and considered,

01:26.656 --> 01:28.590
and correct.

01:28.591 --> 01:30.892
Okay, just an FYI, words
like that make my eye twitch.

01:30.893 --> 01:32.894
Look, we're trying to
articulate U.S. policy

01:32.895 --> 01:35.576
on a broad variety of topics,
so the speech has been vetted...

01:35.577 --> 01:38.233
By various departments
and agencies. I know. I...

01:38.234 --> 01:40.135
Not to mention, we have
to factor in the positions

01:40.136 --> 01:42.115
of our allies to avoid offending them.

01:42.116 --> 01:43.638
And trying to fit that all

01:43.639 --> 01:46.908
in one speech is, like...

01:46.909 --> 01:48.310
super hard.

01:48.311 --> 01:50.011
Well put.

01:50.012 --> 01:52.139
Ma'am, this speech is in two days.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.941
We need to finalize it.

01:53.942 --> 01:55.609
All right, fine.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.344
But give me some substance.

01:57.345 --> 01:59.747
I want something in that
speech that I care about.

01:59.748 --> 02:01.148
That the White House approves.

02:01.149 --> 02:02.748
Blake.

02:04.284 --> 02:06.086
I think Nadine suspects something.

02:06.087 --> 02:08.088
I feel her eyes on me all the time.

02:08.089 --> 02:09.523
Relax, she's not Sauron.

02:09.524 --> 02:11.458
That's what you think.

02:11.459 --> 02:13.427
Your paranoia notwithstanding,

02:13.428 --> 02:15.562
do you have any actual intel for me?

02:15.563 --> 02:18.665
I'm halfway through her
e-mails, calendar and phone logs

02:18.666 --> 02:20.200
from her time with Secretary Marsh.

02:20.201 --> 02:22.669
So far, the only thing that
feels dirty or suspicious is me.

02:22.670 --> 02:27.007
Blake, everyone in this
building is potentially subject

02:27.008 --> 02:28.308
to investigation.

02:28.309 --> 02:31.979
Secretary Marsh, her
old boss, was conspiring

02:31.980 --> 02:33.180
to undermine the Iran peace talks.

02:33.181 --> 02:34.848
I want to make sure I'm not about to get

02:34.849 --> 02:36.350
stabbed in the back by my chief of staff.

02:36.351 --> 02:37.785
The diplomatic security guys think

02:37.786 --> 02:38.886
I'm on a fishing expedition.

02:38.887 --> 02:42.521
You are on a fishing expedition.

02:44.491 --> 02:47.394
I think their question is: why me?

02:47.395 --> 02:49.463
Because unlike the rest of my staff,

02:49.464 --> 02:51.398
you're my hire, and I trust you.

02:51.399 --> 02:53.734
But you can tell the DS that the answer is:

02:53.735 --> 02:56.403
because I said so.

02:56.404 --> 02:58.639
See what I'm talking
about? Boss lady hates me.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.773
No, just your speech.

02:59.774 --> 03:00.941
Thanks.

03:00.942 --> 03:02.910
It's too equivocal. She's no-BS.

03:02.911 --> 03:05.245
And what? I'm pro-BS?

03:05.246 --> 03:07.648
Okay, can I tell you
something, as a friend?

03:07.649 --> 03:09.883
Well, that's a slightly
complicated question.

03:09.884 --> 03:13.454
All this wheedling and
whining... it's not cute.

03:13.455 --> 03:14.922
Wow.

03:14.923 --> 03:16.123
Thanks, friend.

03:16.124 --> 03:18.592
Now, why don't you tell me something...

03:18.593 --> 03:21.395
as more than a friend?

03:21.396 --> 03:23.063
Okay.

03:23.064 --> 03:24.832
Man up, dude.

03:24.833 --> 03:28.234
Oh, I'm a man.

03:28.869 --> 03:31.138
I'm a no-BS man.

03:31.139 --> 03:33.640
Full of substance.

03:33.641 --> 03:36.042
Yeah.

03:37.077 --> 03:39.478
That sounded weird.

03:40.614 --> 03:43.217
Wait, so he's here?

03:43.218 --> 03:44.618
The priest?

03:44.619 --> 03:45.986
Yeah, Laurent Adisa.

03:45.987 --> 03:48.288
My social justice professor
from divinity school.

03:48.289 --> 03:49.957
Oh, that's right.

03:49.958 --> 03:52.259
The guy who gave you a "B."

03:52.260 --> 03:54.114
I thought we were having
dinner Saturday night.

03:54.115 --> 03:55.209
His schedule changed.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.897
And, for the record, it was my only "B."

03:56.898 --> 03:58.031
Ever.

03:58.032 --> 03:59.500
Well, you know what, great,

03:59.501 --> 04:02.836
because I'm exhausted, as one
often is on a Tuesday night.

04:02.837 --> 04:04.471
So I can go up and lay down,

04:04.472 --> 04:06.373
and you guys can re-litigate the "B".

04:06.374 --> 04:07.741
Babe, just come on.

04:07.742 --> 04:10.110
We texted, like, ten times
today, you never said anything.

04:10.111 --> 04:12.478
It was a last-minute thing.

04:13.714 --> 04:15.249
Fine, I'll say hello.

04:15.250 --> 04:18.252
But, for the record,
you're acting very weird.

04:18.253 --> 04:20.487
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Mom. - Hi, Mom.

04:20.488 --> 04:22.923
- Madam Secretary.
- Father Adisa,

04:22.924 --> 04:25.058
really nice surprise.
Please call me Elizabeth.

04:25.059 --> 04:26.460
Well, if you call me Laurent.

04:26.461 --> 04:28.395
Okay. If memory serves...

04:28.396 --> 04:30.264
- Mm-hmm.
- ...you were Henry's

04:30.265 --> 04:32.399
favorite professor, and also the only one

04:32.400 --> 04:34.067
that ever gave him a "B."

04:34.068 --> 04:35.769
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Dad got a "B"?

04:35.770 --> 04:36.803
Unbelievable.

04:36.804 --> 04:38.305
In defense of your father,

04:38.306 --> 04:39.640
he was a very brilliant student,

04:39.641 --> 04:42.142
but he was, uh... rather distracted

04:42.143 --> 04:45.512
by a radiant wife and a brand-new baby.

04:45.513 --> 04:46.780
Well, if by "radiant,"

04:46.781 --> 04:48.482
you mean sleepless and hostile...

04:48.483 --> 04:51.585
I didn't realize you'd been
radiant for so long, Mom.

04:51.586 --> 04:52.886
- Ooh, snap.
- Okay.

04:52.887 --> 04:54.788
- That was a good one.
- Come on, wise guys, beat it.

04:54.789 --> 04:56.223
The grown-ups need to talk.

04:56.224 --> 04:58.325
Okay. Come on, nerds.

04:58.326 --> 05:00.761
- So, Father, uh, Laurent...
- Mm-hmm?

05:00.762 --> 05:03.664
...what brings you to, uh... to D.C.?

05:03.665 --> 05:06.266
Well, I'm here speaking
on behalf of my charities

05:06.267 --> 05:08.902
and some of the churches in the area.

05:08.903 --> 05:10.437
But, um...

05:10.438 --> 05:13.373
I must confess that I didn't just come here

05:13.374 --> 05:16.076
to have a meal with your charming family.

05:16.077 --> 05:17.711
Yes, I'm beginning to get that.

05:17.712 --> 05:21.214
I was wondering if you had heard
about the events of my country,

05:21.215 --> 05:22.950
uh, the Republic of West Africa.

05:22.951 --> 05:26.720
I'm-I'm aware of the coup
that happened six months ago.

05:26.721 --> 05:28.608
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm also aware that the ruling

05:28.609 --> 05:30.791
junta have begun curtailing women's rights,

05:30.792 --> 05:33.493
and they're closing any
schools that they feel

05:33.494 --> 05:35.262
are tainted by Western-style education.

05:35.263 --> 05:38.031
Apparently, that's just the opening act.

05:38.032 --> 05:40.233
The junta has begun a campaign

05:40.234 --> 05:42.936
of ethnic slaughter
against the Beko people.

05:42.937 --> 05:45.205
Wait. That I have not heard.

05:45.206 --> 05:48.575
Now they're ramping up to
enter into the Beko heartland

05:48.576 --> 05:51.278
and clean out the city of St. Juste

05:51.279 --> 05:52.813
in a matter of days.

05:52.814 --> 05:54.047
I...

05:54.048 --> 05:55.983
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

05:55.984 --> 05:58.185
And I will get a full
briefing on it tomorrow.

05:58.186 --> 06:01.654
If-if you will indulge me.

06:04.858 --> 06:07.628
That is my niece, Komoyo,

06:07.629 --> 06:10.564
and her children, Esther and Simon.

06:10.565 --> 06:12.265
Komoyo called me yesterday,

06:12.266 --> 06:15.102
and she said the soldiers
had entered their village.

06:15.103 --> 06:18.338
And now they are on the run.

06:18.339 --> 06:19.940
Laurent, I'm very sorry.

06:19.941 --> 06:23.677
It is I who must apologize
for abusing your hospitality.

06:23.678 --> 06:24.645
No, no, no...

06:24.646 --> 06:26.113
But I just want you to understand

06:26.114 --> 06:28.048
that I did not show you this photograph

06:28.049 --> 06:31.485
so that my family could
get special treatment.

06:31.486 --> 06:34.121
The truth is that you have the power

06:34.122 --> 06:39.758
to answer the desperate prayers
of thousands of my people.

06:42.163 --> 06:43.997
Excuse me.

06:43.998 --> 06:46.899
My phones never stop ringing.

06:48.235 --> 06:50.737
The help that is needed...

06:50.738 --> 06:52.572
it never ends.

06:52.573 --> 06:54.273
Excuse me.

06:54.908 --> 06:56.543
Hello?

06:56.544 --> 06:58.178
Don't be afraid.

06:58.179 --> 07:00.313
I'm here, I'm here.

07:00.314 --> 07:03.250
Ambushing me in our own home? Really?

07:03.251 --> 07:06.620
I know. He sort of ambushed me, too.

07:06.621 --> 07:08.855
You could've given me a heads-up.

07:08.856 --> 07:11.191
Well, he said that he's
pleaded with everyone.

07:11.192 --> 07:14.027
The U.N., the European
Union, African Union,

07:14.028 --> 07:15.429
the press... nobody cares.

07:15.430 --> 07:18.465
It's not that nobody
cares, Henry, it's that...

07:19.867 --> 07:22.235
...things like this are
happening all over the world,

07:22.236 --> 07:24.237
unfortunately, and the
decision to get involved is

07:24.238 --> 07:25.806
a political one. I wish it was

07:25.807 --> 07:27.374
just an ethical dilemma, but it's not.

07:27.375 --> 07:31.378
You know, most of the time, we
play catch-up on these things.

07:31.379 --> 07:34.381
We see these horrible
numbers after the fact.

07:34.382 --> 07:36.950
But here... you have advanced warning.

07:36.951 --> 07:39.785
You have a chance to intervene.

07:40.387 --> 07:42.222
What? Where are you going?

07:42.223 --> 07:43.356
Downstairs to work.

07:43.357 --> 07:45.092
Wh-What would you rather I had done?

07:45.093 --> 07:46.359
Ignore it?

07:46.360 --> 07:48.795
I would rather that you had remembered

07:48.796 --> 07:51.730
that before anything we're a team.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.203
So, no one in this building

07:56.204 --> 07:58.505
has any useful intel
about an imminent campaign

07:58.506 --> 08:00.807
of ethnic cleansing in the
Republic of West Africa?

08:00.808 --> 08:02.442
We've been tracking the situation.

08:02.443 --> 08:04.144
It's unclear if any attacks are imminent.

08:04.145 --> 08:06.813
Given our lack of vital
interests or assets in the RWA,

08:06.814 --> 08:08.949
we concluded the situation
wasn't clear or pressing enough

08:08.950 --> 08:10.517
to bring to your attention.

08:10.518 --> 08:13.019
Okay, attacks are imminent... and
what the hell did you just say?

08:13.020 --> 08:14.688
I'm giving you the
official assessment, ma'am.

08:14.689 --> 08:16.590
It's a matter of grave concern, ma'am,

08:16.591 --> 08:19.226
and I promise you we will look into it.

08:19.227 --> 08:22.062
But right now your top
priority has to be your speech.

08:22.063 --> 08:23.530
Matt took another pass at it.

08:23.531 --> 08:26.166
There's a little something in
there about rising sea levels

08:26.167 --> 08:27.601
and freshwater scarcity

08:27.602 --> 08:29.169
combining to drive global conflict

08:29.170 --> 08:31.571
that I think you're gonna love.
You know, "Water, water..."

08:31.572 --> 08:33.405
Nadine, I'll set the priorities, thank you.

08:33.407 --> 08:35.308
- Sorry, Matt. Thank you.
- Uh, Madam Secretary,

08:35.308 --> 08:37.811
Ambassador Bokassa from the
Republic of West Africa is here.

08:37.812 --> 08:39.645
- He's not on your schedule, ma'am.
- Send him up.

08:39.647 --> 08:41.047
Send him up, please.

08:44.751 --> 08:48.688
Why wasn't I looped in about this meeting?

08:48.689 --> 08:50.791
Oh. Um, it's my mistake.

08:50.792 --> 08:52.826
I'm sorry. I-I must have forgotten.

08:52.827 --> 08:54.461
Oh.

08:54.462 --> 08:58.298
No one in this building forgets
to tell me when they take lunch.

08:58.299 --> 09:00.767
It happened late. I meant to CC you...

09:00.768 --> 09:02.102
Fine.

09:02.103 --> 09:05.137
See if the ambassador
would like cream and sugar.

09:05.605 --> 09:07.107
Madam Secretary,

09:07.108 --> 09:08.842
I cannot imagine where you're getting

09:08.843 --> 09:10.310
such a distorted impression

09:10.311 --> 09:13.280
of life in the glorious
Republic of West Africa.

09:13.281 --> 09:16.049
So you're telling me your
government has no plans

09:16.050 --> 09:18.518
to wage a campaign against the Beko people?

09:18.519 --> 09:20.787
We are a small nation, hmm?

09:20.788 --> 09:22.923
Wedged between Gabon and Cameroon,

09:22.924 --> 09:24.925
with no oil to tempt you.

09:24.926 --> 09:26.259
Why the sudden interest

09:26.260 --> 09:27.594
in our internal affairs?

09:27.595 --> 09:28.995
Okay, I'll ask you again.

09:28.996 --> 09:31.865
Is your government
planning to attack the Beko?

09:31.866 --> 09:33.800
Of course not.

09:33.801 --> 09:35.902
The Beko, like wayward children,

09:35.903 --> 09:38.038
scream at even the slightest discipline.

09:38.039 --> 09:40.173
But such whining is to be expected

09:40.174 --> 09:41.775
as our nation purifies itself

09:41.776 --> 09:44.978
of decadent and poisonous
outside influences.

09:44.979 --> 09:48.582
By that, do you mean educated women or...

09:48.583 --> 09:50.450
expensive watches?

09:50.451 --> 09:54.154
I mean only that the
Ruling Council of the RWA

09:54.155 --> 09:56.957
wishes to bring peace and correct living

09:56.958 --> 09:58.992
to all loyal citizens.

09:58.993 --> 10:02.395
Well, I'm very glad to
hear that your government

10:02.396 --> 10:04.331
has no such plans.

10:04.332 --> 10:08.001
Just in case they do, you
tell your bosses back home

10:08.002 --> 10:10.103
that the United States is watching.

10:10.104 --> 10:12.271
Good day.

10:48.642 --> 10:51.044
And here are the records

10:51.045 --> 10:53.980
for Ms. Tolliver's work-issued BlackBerry

10:53.981 --> 10:58.150
from the months immediately
after Secretary Marsh died.

11:01.121 --> 11:04.157
Say, how do you DS guys do it?

11:04.158 --> 11:06.960
You just sit down here all
day, snooping on people?

11:06.961 --> 11:09.328
We're patriots.

11:12.499 --> 11:15.400
Hey, wait a second.

11:16.436 --> 11:18.038
This call here... was that recorded?

11:18.039 --> 11:20.273
Hmm. Let me see.

11:21.242 --> 11:22.375
Nope.

11:22.376 --> 11:25.210
Just the metadata showing it happened. _

11:27.681 --> 11:29.516
BLAKE Three weeks ago,

11:29.517 --> 11:31.051
Nadine had a 20-minute conversation

11:31.052 --> 11:33.219
on her work cell phone
with Constantine Stahl.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.655
That's an awfully long time to have a chat

11:35.656 --> 11:37.290
with one of Marsh's biggest backers.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.458
Three weeks ago, you were...

11:38.459 --> 11:41.227
Scrambling to salvage the Iran peace talks.

11:41.228 --> 11:44.064
Any chance they were just catching up?

11:44.065 --> 11:47.467
Nadine and a casino billionaire
whose pet political cause

11:47.468 --> 11:50.103
is to bomb Iran, swapping funny stories?

11:50.104 --> 11:52.138
No.

11:52.139 --> 11:56.009
More likely he was calling to
pump her for intel on the talks.

11:56.010 --> 11:57.911
Which would make her a spy.

11:57.912 --> 12:00.780
Is she dumb enough to take
that call on a work phone?

12:00.781 --> 12:02.782
I don't know. Is there any way to find out?

12:02.783 --> 12:04.250
There's no audio of the call.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.788
Well, then unless

12:08.789 --> 12:11.791
something definitive arises
quickly to change my mind,

12:11.792 --> 12:13.560
I'll have to pull her security clearance,

12:13.561 --> 12:15.462
pending a full investigation.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.234
Thanks for taking time off from prepping

12:21.235 --> 12:23.737
for your fancy speech to go
where the common folk eat.

12:23.738 --> 12:25.138
Oh, are you kidding me?

12:25.139 --> 12:28.608
It's nice to get out of the
office for a little bite of...

12:28.609 --> 12:30.643
fried everything.

12:30.644 --> 12:33.446
What can I say? I miss
our gross work lunches.

12:33.447 --> 12:35.814
Me, too.

12:37.817 --> 12:40.520
So this is a right-to-business
kind of fried lunch, yeah?

12:40.521 --> 12:42.655
I'm afraid so.

12:42.656 --> 12:45.225
What's the CIA's read on the RWA?

12:45.226 --> 12:47.327
Your source was right.

12:47.328 --> 12:49.796
The junta's gearing up to
drive out the Beko minority

12:49.797 --> 12:52.866
by any means, up to and including genocide.

12:52.867 --> 12:54.934
What would it take to stop it?

12:54.935 --> 12:56.703
Well, short of an act of God,

12:56.704 --> 12:58.271
nothing.

12:58.272 --> 13:00.640
Not with the resources the U.S. is willing

13:00.641 --> 13:02.442
to bring to bear, which is none.

13:02.443 --> 13:03.943
What's left is the African Union,

13:03.944 --> 13:06.613
but they have a hard time
getting all their member states

13:06.614 --> 13:08.948
on the same page... or maybe the French,

13:08.949 --> 13:11.618
but they're bogged down in,
like, five other countries.

13:11.619 --> 13:12.952
Blue-sky it for me.

13:12.953 --> 13:14.254
If money was no object,

13:14.255 --> 13:16.589
ground troops, air support, logistics.

13:16.590 --> 13:18.525
Yeah, you'd need all of the above.

13:18.526 --> 13:21.861
I should warn you, the RWA is a toxic mess.

13:21.862 --> 13:24.764
Part of the country not under
the boot of the junta is run...

13:24.765 --> 13:26.066
By a bunch of renegade warlords

13:26.067 --> 13:28.668
with RPGs and machine guns, and... I know.

13:28.669 --> 13:31.638
Then you know the odds of an
intervention going sideways...

13:31.639 --> 13:34.407
I know. Are extremely high, I got it.

13:34.408 --> 13:35.842
Now, what else do I need?

13:35.843 --> 13:37.143
Well, if...

13:37.144 --> 13:38.545
Thanks.

13:38.546 --> 13:41.247
Name one vital interest we have

13:41.248 --> 13:43.083
in the Republic of West Africa.

13:43.084 --> 13:44.317
Bauxite.

13:44.318 --> 13:46.252
It's the key mineral in aluminum.

13:46.253 --> 13:49.055
Aluminum, I know. You're kidding,

13:49.056 --> 13:50.190
right?

13:50.191 --> 13:51.624
I can see the bumper stickers now.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.193
"No Blood for Foil."

13:53.194 --> 13:57.030
Okay, fine. We don't have any
vital interests in the RWA,

13:57.031 --> 14:00.100
except for 50,000 innocent civilians

14:00.101 --> 14:01.701
who are about to be murdered on our watch.

14:01.702 --> 14:03.069
For God's sake,

14:03.070 --> 14:05.038
we haven't exactly put a
bow on the Middle East yet.

14:05.039 --> 14:06.197
You want to go into Africa?

14:06.198 --> 14:08.708
Why aren't the stakeholders in
the region making it an issue?

14:08.709 --> 14:11.111
This is a rapidly unfolding situation.

14:11.112 --> 14:14.814
If we don't do something,
and soon, it'll be too late.

14:14.815 --> 14:16.883
Bess, I hear you.

14:16.884 --> 14:18.051
The junta is despicable.

14:18.052 --> 14:19.419
And if reports

14:19.420 --> 14:21.020
about what they're planning are correct...

14:21.021 --> 14:23.323
They are correct, sir.

14:23.324 --> 14:25.525
No sense pretending that they're not.

14:25.526 --> 14:26.659
No one's pretending here.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.128
- I...
- The fact is,

14:28.129 --> 14:29.596
this is not our fight.

14:29.597 --> 14:31.664
If we stand back, we're accused of apathy.

14:31.665 --> 14:34.134
If we engage, we're accused
of policing the world.

14:34.135 --> 14:37.203
Military intervention is a dog's breakfast,

14:37.204 --> 14:39.205
no matter the cause.

14:39.206 --> 14:41.374
Look...

14:41.375 --> 14:43.443
you know I'm a realist,

14:43.444 --> 14:47.981
but there are events that
transcend national interest,

14:47.982 --> 14:52.152
and I believe this is one of those.

14:52.153 --> 14:55.155
I know you do.

14:55.156 --> 14:57.489
But I don't.

15:02.136 --> 15:09.854
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

15:17.369 --> 15:18.644
So what do you say, Danny?

15:18.645 --> 15:20.093
Want to help us get this story out there,

15:20.094 --> 15:22.140
maybe grab yourself another Pulitzer,

15:22.141 --> 15:23.441
keep the first one company?

15:23.442 --> 15:25.610
I can pass this along to my colleagues

15:25.611 --> 15:27.279
on the international desk, but obviously

15:27.280 --> 15:29.447
they're gonna have to vet your source.

15:29.448 --> 15:30.615
Source? I am the source.

15:30.616 --> 15:32.150
I'm sitting right here in front of you.

15:32.151 --> 15:33.418
Ask me anything you want.

15:33.419 --> 15:36.254
It's the journalistic
process... takes time.

15:36.255 --> 15:38.423
Time? Time is precisely

15:38.424 --> 15:40.458
what thousands of innocent

15:40.459 --> 15:41.860
victims do not have!

15:41.861 --> 15:44.529
Look, I-I know you'll do
everything you can to help.

15:44.530 --> 15:46.798
I really appreciate you
meeting with us. Thanks.

15:46.799 --> 15:49.199
You bet.

15:52.137 --> 15:54.172
That went well.

15:54.173 --> 15:56.274
Forgive me, Henry.

15:56.275 --> 15:58.276
I find myself getting angry these days,

15:58.277 --> 16:01.780
not just at God for letting
terrible things happen

16:01.781 --> 16:04.583
to innocent people, but for selecting a...

16:04.584 --> 16:07.385
a poor and impatient
messenger such as myself.

16:07.386 --> 16:09.921
We'll just keep pushing, okay?

16:09.922 --> 16:12.157
In the meantime,

16:12.158 --> 16:14.625
take it easy on yourself, man.

16:17.629 --> 16:19.564
Mom?

16:19.565 --> 16:20.964
Yeah.

16:22.801 --> 16:24.791
Whatever it is that you're worried about,

16:24.792 --> 16:26.805
I'm pretty sure the answer's

16:26.806 --> 16:28.807
not in there.

16:28.808 --> 16:31.009
You're probably right.

16:31.010 --> 16:34.045
So, what are we doing to
stop what's going to happen

16:34.046 --> 16:35.847
in the Republic of West Africa?

16:35.848 --> 16:39.117
Nothing.

16:39.118 --> 16:41.753
Because when the president
makes a very good case

16:41.754 --> 16:46.558
for why not to intervene,
that is pretty much it.

16:46.559 --> 16:48.727
Hmm.

16:48.728 --> 16:50.528
Do you remember in the fifth grade

16:50.529 --> 16:52.764
when I almost quit that
school backpacking trip

16:52.765 --> 16:54.132
because I was afraid of heights,

16:54.133 --> 16:56.001
and I really didn't
want to go rock-climbing?

16:56.002 --> 16:58.703
You would be amazed how
much parents block out.

16:58.704 --> 17:00.639
And do you remember what you said to me

17:00.640 --> 17:02.207
when I called you in a panic?

17:02.208 --> 17:05.109
No, but I feel like I'm
about to be embarrassed.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.380
You said, "Honey, you are the descendent

17:08.381 --> 17:10.448
"of some of the greatest
heroes and scoundrels

17:10.449 --> 17:12.050
"that the Commonwealth of Virginia

17:12.050 --> 17:13.351
has ever seen."

17:14.753 --> 17:16.621
"If you've got one thing

17:16.622 --> 17:18.857
"running through your veins, it's guts.

17:18.858 --> 17:20.825
"Now, don't call me back

17:20.826 --> 17:22.894
until you're at the top of
that mountain, little girl."

17:22.895 --> 17:24.462
I actually said that?

17:24.463 --> 17:25.262
Yup.

17:25.263 --> 17:28.098
Oh, what a pain in the ass I am.

17:28.099 --> 17:31.869
And why did I sound like Dolly Parton?

17:32.504 --> 17:34.305
I don't know.

17:35.775 --> 17:38.208
I got to the top of the mountain though.

17:38.943 --> 17:40.979
Bet you did.

17:40.980 --> 17:44.514
You'll think of something, Mom.

17:46.151 --> 17:48.520
Good night.

17:48.521 --> 17:50.988
Good night, baby.

18:08.908 --> 18:11.910
That is great news.

18:11.911 --> 18:13.645
Yeah, keep me posted.

18:13.646 --> 18:15.747
Thanks again, buddy. All right, bye.

18:15.748 --> 18:17.515
The Washington Chronicle
is into the story.

18:17.516 --> 18:19.217
They're putting a couple reporters on it.

18:19.218 --> 18:21.086
It should run in a day or two.

18:21.087 --> 18:22.687
Ah, that's good news, indeed.

18:22.688 --> 18:25.423
But we may be running
out of time for an article

18:25.424 --> 18:27.492
in a newspaper to be of much help.

18:27.493 --> 18:31.996
Oh, speaking of time, um...
yeah, Elizabeth's speech is on.

18:31.997 --> 18:34.933
The United States will continue to work

18:34.934 --> 18:36.267
with our friends and partners

18:36.268 --> 18:38.403
around the world on a host of issues.

18:38.404 --> 18:39.738
This is good.

18:39.739 --> 18:41.172
The challenges we face are...

18:41.173 --> 18:43.041
This is poetry, is what this is.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.576
...as always, daunting.

18:44.577 --> 18:46.578
But we can take heart

18:46.579 --> 18:49.948
that just as our forebears had the courage

18:49.949 --> 18:55.152
to confront the issues of
their day, so we, too...

18:56.654 --> 18:58.121
Uh-oh.

18:58.690 --> 19:00.057
What's happening?

19:01.626 --> 19:04.763
So we, too, can

19:04.764 --> 19:07.766
confront the great
moral issues of our time,

19:07.767 --> 19:11.401
if only we can find...

19:14.205 --> 19:16.606
If...

19:18.343 --> 19:20.311
If only we can find the guts.

19:20.312 --> 19:21.312
Guts?

19:21.313 --> 19:22.947
Oh, God, she's going off book.

19:22.948 --> 19:24.649
Esteemed colleagues, the United States

19:24.650 --> 19:27.485
has learned that a vast number of

19:27.486 --> 19:31.022
people from the Republic of
West Africa are in grave danger.

19:31.023 --> 19:33.324
The new regime of that nation,

19:33.325 --> 19:36.828
in its hatred of modern education,

19:36.829 --> 19:38.630
women's rights

19:38.631 --> 19:41.199
and the rights of ethnic minorities,

19:41.200 --> 19:42.867
plans to lash out

19:42.868 --> 19:45.470
violently against all of
those cherished principles.

19:45.471 --> 19:46.805
That's my wife.

19:46.806 --> 19:48.206
But it's not the principles...

19:48.207 --> 19:49.974
That's my wife.

19:49.975 --> 19:53.745
...they plan to terrorize and murder.

19:53.746 --> 19:59.918
It is thousands of innocent
men, women and children.

19:59.919 --> 20:02.187
Father Laurent Adisa,

20:02.188 --> 20:04.422
whose charity is sheltering
many of the displaced...

20:04.423 --> 20:05.824
This isn't happening.

20:05.825 --> 20:07.625
Daisy, Matt, get ready to issue

20:07.626 --> 20:09.972
- a statement walking all of this back.
- On it.

20:09.973 --> 20:11.930
Why? She's just gonna say
whatever she wants anyway.

20:11.931 --> 20:12.797
Matt.

20:12.798 --> 20:14.799
...thousands of peoples'

20:14.800 --> 20:16.348
desperate prayers.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.970
Well, now that we have heard those prayers,

20:18.971 --> 20:23.106
do we have the courage to answer them?

20:24.709 --> 20:26.711
Thank you.

20:29.648 --> 20:32.684
...the United States Secretary
of State in her first major...

20:32.685 --> 20:35.788
For the record, I didn't
know that was coming.

20:41.013 --> 20:44.274
At a speech at the World Affairs
Committee, U.S. Secretary...

20:44.275 --> 20:45.742
Let me guess.

20:45.743 --> 20:47.878
White House loved the speech.

20:47.879 --> 20:51.081
Russell Jackson has already
texted several times.

20:51.082 --> 20:53.449
Lots of smiley faces?

20:55.219 --> 20:57.054
I'm in big trouble, I
know. But at least now,

20:57.055 --> 20:58.937
no one can say they didn't
know it was going on.

20:58.938 --> 21:00.981
Does the speech reflect an
official change in policy?

21:00.982 --> 21:03.694
No, but maybe we lit a fire

21:03.695 --> 21:05.562
under the African Union and the French.

21:05.563 --> 21:07.431
You think they've got the will or resources

21:07.432 --> 21:08.866
- to pull this off?
- Honestly,

21:08.867 --> 21:09.967
that was a Hail Mary.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.169
So, let's see if anyone caught it

21:12.170 --> 21:14.136
while we still have jobs.

21:15.205 --> 21:17.540
Well, at least she doesn't seem flip.

21:18.141 --> 21:20.711
Madame l'Ambassadeur?

21:25.517 --> 21:28.619
I was quite impressed with
your speech, Elizabeth.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.687
How impressed?

21:30.688 --> 21:35.392
Perhaps it would be possible
for us to lend a little support.

21:35.393 --> 21:37.327
Air support?

21:37.328 --> 21:40.364
Assuming, of course, that
your speech is indicative

21:40.365 --> 21:42.366
of an American willingness to act...

21:42.367 --> 21:44.301
I'm working on it.

21:44.302 --> 21:48.305
Uh, oui. Bonne chance,
Madame la Secretaire.

21:48.306 --> 21:50.807
Merci.

21:50.808 --> 21:53.243
- I know what you're doing.
- You do?

21:53.244 --> 21:55.879
Do I look like an idiot?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.748
No, no.

21:57.749 --> 21:59.983
You are so relentlessly intelligent.

21:59.984 --> 22:02.719
She's telling you to
keep me out of the loop

22:02.720 --> 22:05.822
on certain decisions, and
you're being a good soldier

22:05.823 --> 22:07.791
and taking the heat.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.893
Blake,

22:09.894 --> 22:11.094
I'm a petite woman,

22:11.095 --> 22:13.797
and I've had a flute
and a half of champagne,

22:13.798 --> 22:15.332
so I'm going to be

22:15.333 --> 22:16.466
honest with you.

22:16.467 --> 22:17.734
That's good.

22:17.735 --> 22:21.738
I can understand why
the secretary might not

22:21.739 --> 22:23.840
trust me completely.

22:23.841 --> 22:29.680
But I can also tell you
with s-some certainty

22:29.681 --> 22:35.152
that I am extremely good at my job.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.720
Oh, I agree with you.

22:36.721 --> 22:39.690
I don't need your agreement.

22:39.691 --> 22:43.060
And do you know what else I have in spades?

22:43.061 --> 22:44.561
A sense of duty.

22:44.562 --> 22:47.631
I have a duty to this nation,

22:47.632 --> 22:50.934
to the department, and believe it or not,

22:50.935 --> 22:54.705
to that incredibly...

22:56.174 --> 22:59.341
...challenging woman over there.

23:05.449 --> 23:07.517
Madam Secretary,

23:07.518 --> 23:10.320
I found your speech most distressing.

23:10.321 --> 23:12.589
I'm very pleased to hear that.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.525
But if America had the guts to take action,

23:15.526 --> 23:18.228
you would not have
needed to make the speech.

23:18.229 --> 23:20.296
N'est-Ce pas?

23:26.269 --> 23:27.938
Honey, are you awake?

23:27.939 --> 23:30.273
- Absolutely.
- I can't sleep, either.

23:30.274 --> 23:32.242
You know, I've been banging
on the African Union,

23:32.243 --> 23:34.544
and I think I can get them
to commit ground troops

23:34.545 --> 23:37.648
if the French will kick in air power.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.716
Which they'll only do if...

23:39.717 --> 23:41.952
we have some skin in the game, too.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.554
You were sleeping. Am I keeping you up?

23:44.555 --> 23:45.822
No, I'm here. I'm right here.

23:45.823 --> 23:47.424
Good, because let's not forget

23:47.425 --> 23:49.426
who started this whole thing.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.828
Uh, I want to give you credit

23:51.829 --> 23:53.797
and say the junta, but...

23:53.798 --> 23:56.198
I think you mean me.

23:58.969 --> 24:03.373
And believe me, I will
never forget what you did.

24:03.374 --> 24:05.842
Neither will Laurent.

24:05.843 --> 24:08.344
It was incredibly brave.

24:10.747 --> 24:12.949
I've had a flurry of testy exchanges

24:12.950 --> 24:14.451
with Russell Jackson.

24:15.390 --> 24:17.387
I can't get POTUS to return my phone call,

24:17.388 --> 24:18.488
which only means

24:18.489 --> 24:20.924
that Russell's gotten into his head,

24:20.925 --> 24:24.027
and they're... holed up somewhere

24:24.028 --> 24:25.562
deciding who's gonna replace me.

24:25.563 --> 24:26.897
Oh, come on.

24:26.898 --> 24:30.701
Which I didn't think was
gonna happen quite this fast.

24:30.702 --> 24:33.102
What is it?

24:34.705 --> 24:37.539
I've been summoned to the White House.

24:44.614 --> 24:48.151
Good evening, Russell.

24:48.152 --> 24:49.786
I have something to say

24:49.787 --> 24:52.989
that the president thought
you should hear in person.

24:52.990 --> 24:55.726
I'm sure it gives you
no pleasure to say it.

24:57.028 --> 25:00.130
That speech of yours...

25:00.131 --> 25:03.800
was reckless, impulsive,
damn near insubordinate.

25:03.801 --> 25:07.003
I'm fully prepared to live with
the consequences of my actions.

25:07.004 --> 25:09.406
What I couldn't live
with were the consequences

25:09.407 --> 25:10.674
- of my inactions.
- Excuse me,

25:10.675 --> 25:12.843
did I say I brought you
here so you could talk?

25:12.844 --> 25:15.712
Excuse me, but I'm the Secretary of State,

25:15.713 --> 25:17.981
and you'll speak to me with the respect

25:17.982 --> 25:19.149
that that office demands.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.450
For now, you are.

25:20.451 --> 25:22.419
You want to condescend to me?

25:22.420 --> 25:24.187
Fine. You have to fire me first.

25:24.188 --> 25:27.591
So if that's the message that
you were dispatched to deliver,

25:27.592 --> 25:29.359
just get on with it.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.628
Let's go.

25:31.629 --> 25:34.664
You know what pisses me off the most?

25:34.665 --> 25:35.932
The speech worked.

25:35.933 --> 25:38.335
The president thinks you're right.

25:38.336 --> 25:41.071
So here's the offer.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.473
Ground troops are still out.

25:43.474 --> 25:45.909
So is air support.

25:45.910 --> 25:47.911
Logistics, then?

25:47.912 --> 25:50.514
Radar, satellites, a few C-130s.

25:50.515 --> 25:53.116
We're not offering the
invasion of Normandy here.

25:53.117 --> 25:56.819
But that should be enough to get
the French to commit air power.

25:58.421 --> 26:00.490
Thank you, Russell.

26:00.491 --> 26:02.225
Don't thank me.

26:02.226 --> 26:05.561
I wanted us to have the other talk tonight.

26:08.632 --> 26:11.234
Okay. Merci.

26:11.235 --> 26:12.769
Jay.

26:12.770 --> 26:14.638
I just got off the phone with the French.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.106
They're in for air support.

26:16.107 --> 26:18.341
Then the African Union can
assemble a quick-reaction force

26:18.342 --> 26:20.010
with troops mostly from
Burundi and Tanzania

26:20.011 --> 26:21.478
that can deploy into the RWA.

26:21.479 --> 26:23.280
Excellent.

26:23.281 --> 26:25.649
Nadine, get the SecDef's
office on the phone.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.050
Tell him the coalition's a go.

26:27.051 --> 26:28.618
He can start sending logistical assets

26:28.619 --> 26:29.953
into the region right away.

26:29.954 --> 26:30.987
Yes, ma'am.

26:30.988 --> 26:33.623
Hey.

26:33.624 --> 26:34.925
So what's up?

26:34.926 --> 26:37.227
My guys dug up something on your priest.

26:37.228 --> 26:38.695
It ain't good.

26:38.696 --> 26:40.664
Daisy, turn that up, will you?

26:40.665 --> 26:43.066
...mentioned you and your
charity in her speech.

26:43.067 --> 26:46.336
Does this growing consensus
for action in your country

26:46.337 --> 26:47.771
perhaps owe a debt to you?

26:47.772 --> 26:49.239
It's just the opposite.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.575
Of course, we who are in the RWA,

26:51.576 --> 26:54.544
we owe a debt to Secretary McCord.

26:54.545 --> 26:57.479
Guy's pretty smooth for his
first time on cable news.

27:02.819 --> 27:04.921
Madam Secretary, sorry to interrupt.

27:04.922 --> 27:06.423
Uh, apparently, your husband is

27:06.424 --> 27:07.858
- in the building.
- Bad news.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.860
Wh-What is it?

27:09.861 --> 27:11.161
Father Adisa, what do you say

27:11.162 --> 27:12.462
to the recently uncovered allegations

27:12.463 --> 27:14.264
that your charity has been involved

27:14.265 --> 27:16.099
in the smuggling of drugs
across international borders

27:16.100 --> 27:18.902
by the very people you
have deemed refugees?

27:18.903 --> 27:20.003
Oh, my God.

27:20.004 --> 27:22.172
My friend down at The Chronicle says

27:22.173 --> 27:24.441
the Mexican cartels have been
smuggling drugs into Europe

27:24.442 --> 27:26.276
overland through Africa.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.178
And apparently, Laurent is involved.

27:28.179 --> 27:31.681
I wanted to tell you in person.

27:31.682 --> 27:34.417
I don't know what to say, honey.

27:34.418 --> 27:36.251
The White House is on the line.

27:40.457 --> 27:42.659
Course they are... because I just tied

27:42.660 --> 27:46.762
the President of the United
States to a drug dealer.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.274
How the hell did your people not vet Adisa

27:57.275 --> 28:00.211
before you hijacked our
speech to gush about him?!

28:00.212 --> 28:02.947
I sprung Adisa on them;
that was my screw up.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.015
Oh, for once, an understatement.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.219
The guy helps criminal
organizations mule cocaine

28:08.220 --> 28:10.988
into Europe!

28:10.989 --> 28:13.190
There's more bad news, sir: the French have

28:13.191 --> 28:14.792
rescinded their offer of air support.

28:14.793 --> 28:17.361
That's a hell of a coalition
you've built us, Elizabeth.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.765
Illegal immigration and
drugs are hot-button issues

28:20.766 --> 28:21.832
in France.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.367
They feel that an intervention tied

28:23.368 --> 28:25.536
to a man tainted by both would not

28:25.537 --> 28:26.871
go over well with their public.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.272
It's called politics.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.040
You might want to read up on it.

28:30.041 --> 28:33.077
If you've got a next move,
Beth, I'd love to hear about it.

28:33.078 --> 28:35.579
I think there's only one
way to salvage this crisis.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.249
Oh, I swear to God, if you
say "air support" right now...

28:38.250 --> 28:41.786
Tens of thousands of
people are going to die...

28:41.787 --> 28:44.588
and we back away because some dirty priest

28:44.589 --> 28:47.324
made us look dumb for a news cycle or two?

28:47.325 --> 28:48.526
Is that leadership?

28:48.527 --> 28:52.263
We save those people, at
no loss of American life,

28:52.264 --> 28:54.765
because we're only sending in a squadron

28:54.766 --> 28:58.602
of F-15s that the junta doesn't
have the missiles to shoot down,

28:58.603 --> 29:00.704
and we win that news cycle

29:00.705 --> 29:03.073
- because we're heroes.
- Bravo, Elizabeth.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.075
Another rousing speech.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.379
But all your feel-good
rhetoric won't matter if this...

29:08.380 --> 29:10.247
this half-baked intervention

29:10.248 --> 29:13.384
goes south and turns into Mogadishu.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.820
Mr. President...

29:15.821 --> 29:18.321
you will own that.

29:19.156 --> 29:21.425
And if 50,000 people are slaughtered

29:21.426 --> 29:24.962
while I sit on my hands...

29:24.963 --> 29:27.797
that I will own to my grave.

29:29.467 --> 29:30.968
No more screw ups.

29:30.969 --> 29:33.369
Stay on top of every detail.

29:35.172 --> 29:37.575
We're off the priest.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.476
We're off the French.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.810
But the intervention's on.

29:39.811 --> 29:40.711
I feel dizzy.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.079
Lives hang in the balance, dude.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.280
Dizzy but focused.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.049
Okay, how's this? "While the United States

29:45.050 --> 29:46.684
"is deeply concerned over the allegations

29:46.685 --> 29:48.819
"against Father Adisa, we are unwavering

29:48.820 --> 29:51.755
in our dedication to preserve
the safety of the Beko people."

29:51.756 --> 29:53.257
Now, the next part's tricky.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.492
Uh, therefore, uh,

29:54.493 --> 29:56.427
we will provide the African Union force

29:56.428 --> 29:58.329
both logistical and air support

29:58.330 --> 30:01.031
while continuing to seek
out a peaceful resolution

30:01.032 --> 30:02.533
to this crisis. Boom!

30:02.534 --> 30:03.868
Want to grab lunch?

30:03.869 --> 30:05.769
- I have to go brief the gaggle.
- You know, when you say that,

30:05.770 --> 30:07.271
it's like you're saying
you got to feed the baby,

30:07.272 --> 30:11.240
but the baby's actually
30 pasty j-journalists.

30:11.876 --> 30:12.877
You know?

30:12.878 --> 30:14.278
African Union troops

30:14.279 --> 30:15.779
crossed the border from Cameroon

30:15.780 --> 30:18.148
into the Republic of West Africa today.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.250
They hope to traverse

30:19.251 --> 30:20.851
the lawless, warlord-dominated

30:20.852 --> 30:23.053
northern region in time to prevent

30:23.054 --> 30:26.657
what American Secretary of
State Elizabeth McCord is calling

30:26.658 --> 30:30.227
an imminent genocide in
the country's heartland.

30:30.228 --> 30:33.197
The world's attention was
focused on the people of...

30:33.198 --> 30:36.500
You know, I remember your first seminar.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.235
"Living Faith."

30:40.504 --> 30:44.108
You showed us slides of that
AIDS hospice that you built.

30:44.109 --> 30:46.010
At a time when most people

30:46.011 --> 30:48.312
wouldn't even go near someone who was sick.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.647
And I thought,

30:49.648 --> 30:51.148
yeah...

30:51.149 --> 30:53.717
yeah, this is the teacher
I've been looking for.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.152
This guy.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.554
The real deal.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.055
And now?

30:58.056 --> 30:59.657
You deceived me.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.392
You compromised my wife's integrity.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.394
What choice did I have?

31:03.395 --> 31:05.329
How about the truth?

31:05.330 --> 31:06.931
You really think

31:06.932 --> 31:08.799
I'd turn a blind eye to genocide?

31:08.800 --> 31:12.036
So, now... knowing the truth,

31:12.037 --> 31:14.872
would you still have gone
straight to Elizabeth?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.607
What is the truth, by the way?

31:16.608 --> 31:19.743
- You didn't answer my question.
- You answer mine.

31:19.744 --> 31:21.579
The truth is

31:21.580 --> 31:24.348
that sometimes the only
way to insure safe passage

31:24.349 --> 31:26.784
for a desperate person to get to Europe

31:26.785 --> 31:28.385
is to smuggle drugs.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.187
That's "living faith."

31:30.188 --> 31:33.624
No, that is not what the man who
taught that seminar would say.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.825
That is exactly what he would say.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.227
"Any man among us who seems religious

31:37.228 --> 31:39.997
"and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth

31:39.998 --> 31:43.434
his own heart, that
man's religion is vain."

31:43.435 --> 31:46.604
Do you have any idea how
many pockets that I lined

31:46.605 --> 31:48.339
in order to get that hospice built?

31:48.340 --> 31:51.442
Yes, I dealt with warlords,

31:51.443 --> 31:54.545
who-who control the drugs and the guns

31:54.546 --> 31:56.280
and the borders.

31:56.281 --> 31:59.350
But in this failed state,
that... is the Lord's work.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.584
What about

32:00.585 --> 32:03.287
the thousands... the millions
of people who will die

32:03.288 --> 32:05.856
because of the drug
trade and the gunrunning?

32:05.857 --> 32:07.358
Are their lives less valuable?

32:07.359 --> 32:08.959
No, of course not.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.528
They, too, need salvation.

32:11.529 --> 32:12.997
But, Henry...

32:12.998 --> 32:16.433
this is my little patch of darkness.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.302
I can only work where I'm put.

32:18.303 --> 32:20.304
You can say whatever you want,

32:20.305 --> 32:21.972
but you've crossed the
line and you know it.

32:21.973 --> 32:24.742
I will not apologize
for trying to save lives

32:24.743 --> 32:29.111
with the-the few tools
that I have at my disposal.

32:31.649 --> 32:34.585
To answer your question... of course,

32:34.586 --> 32:36.620
I would have gone to Elizabeth.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.055
That's what true friends do.

32:38.056 --> 32:39.923
And that's what I thought you were.

32:39.924 --> 32:46.196
I'll pray for your people
and for your family.

32:46.197 --> 32:49.398
But you and I are done.

32:54.004 --> 32:55.973
So what's in this hypothetical envelope

32:55.974 --> 32:58.609
that may or may not be on my desk?

32:58.610 --> 33:01.879
A job offer made to Nadine
by one Constantine Stahl,

33:01.880 --> 33:04.348
tendered the very day of
the phone call in question.

33:04.349 --> 33:06.116
She... turned it down, obviously.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.351
Why?

33:07.352 --> 33:10.688
As I mentioned, she has
a... strong sense of duty.

33:10.689 --> 33:13.023
Blake, you put too much stock

33:13.024 --> 33:15.392
in the things people
say when they're tipsy.

33:15.393 --> 33:16.627
Really?

33:16.628 --> 33:18.295
Where'd you get this?

33:18.296 --> 33:20.230
Harvard Assistants' Mafia.

33:20.231 --> 33:23.133
Three words you rarely
hear strung together.

33:23.134 --> 33:25.903
Yet they constitute a thing.

33:25.904 --> 33:28.471
Nice work.

33:28.939 --> 33:29.940
Ma'am,

33:29.941 --> 33:31.308
the African Union forces

33:31.309 --> 33:32.643
have bogged down.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.678
Uh, define "bogged down."

33:34.679 --> 33:36.046
They're inside the RWA,

33:36.047 --> 33:38.482
but they haven't advanced in the last hour.

33:38.483 --> 33:40.484
What, did they get a flat tire?

33:40.485 --> 33:42.586
Isn't the entire point of air support

33:42.587 --> 33:46.390
to support the troops on
the ground from the... air?!

33:46.391 --> 33:49.993
Our rules of engagement
limit the use of air power

33:49.994 --> 33:52.229
to engaging junta forces only.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.363
Gentlemen.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.598
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.033
What is the holdup, Major Hicks?

33:56.034 --> 33:59.169
Why aren't the African Union
troops moving towards St. Juste?

33:59.170 --> 34:02.139
Madam Secretary, the African Union forces

34:02.140 --> 34:05.609
are in a standoff in the
northern province of the RWA.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.879
Here, 30 miles from the Cameroon border.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.147
With whom?

34:10.148 --> 34:12.649
Most likely the warlords who
control the border region.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.118
They'll never get to the Beko in time.

34:14.119 --> 34:15.786
What about air support?

34:15.786 --> 34:17.020
Can't we engage with them?

34:17.021 --> 34:18.856
See? Thank you.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.958
Ma'am, we are concerned that
bombing the warlords' militias

34:21.960 --> 34:23.927
will turn the population of the north

34:23.928 --> 34:26.597
against the African Union forces,

34:26.598 --> 34:28.599
and that will exacerbate
the situation further.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.768
The junta bought these
guys off, didn't they?

34:31.770 --> 34:33.804
That's CIA's working hypothesis.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.906
How long until the African Union

34:35.907 --> 34:37.074
pull out their troops?

34:37.074 --> 34:38.641
They're telling us 12 hours.

34:38.643 --> 34:41.145
They are concerned that if their forces

34:41.146 --> 34:43.045
are encircled, they'll have to

34:43.047 --> 34:45.047
shoot their way back to Cameroon.

34:45.049 --> 34:47.451
So we need more troops

34:47.452 --> 34:49.652
to beef up the African Union forces.

34:49.654 --> 34:55.058
Or we need to cut a
deal with these warlords.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.305
_

35:18.982 --> 35:21.350
_

35:21.937 --> 35:25.741
_

35:27.381 --> 35:28.939
_

35:33.965 --> 35:36.567
Please ask the minister to reconsider.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.902
No, no, I assure you

35:38.903 --> 35:40.404
we do not understand,

35:40.405 --> 35:44.174
and we will remember
his lack of cooperation.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.910
South Africa is definitively out.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.613
So is Kenya. DOD says they're bogged down

35:49.614 --> 35:50.814
fighting Al-Shabaab.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.349
Can somebody please get me

35:52.350 --> 35:55.751
some troops before this bloodbath begins?

35:58.889 --> 36:00.791
Isabelle, what do you got?

36:00.792 --> 36:02.693
Oh, God.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.828
All right.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.029
Thank you.

36:06.030 --> 36:10.267
CIA tried to use a local
intermediary to swing a deal

36:10.268 --> 36:11.468
with the warlords.

36:11.469 --> 36:14.804
Video of his body just went up on YouTube.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.109
I'm-I'm sorry, but we're out of options.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.078
I refuse to accept that, Jay.

36:21.079 --> 36:23.746
There's literally nobody
else to call, ma'am.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.482
We were so close.

36:34.483 --> 36:38.052
We had troops in-country and...

36:38.053 --> 36:39.220
I'm so sorry.

36:39.221 --> 36:40.421
You're sorry?

36:40.422 --> 36:43.224
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life apologizing

36:43.225 --> 36:44.925
for involving you with Laurent.

36:44.926 --> 36:46.360
Don't. That's crazy.

36:46.361 --> 36:48.929
It's not like he was lying
about what the junta are doing.

36:48.930 --> 36:50.164
It turns out it was practically

36:50.165 --> 36:51.532
the only thing he wasn't lying about.

36:51.533 --> 36:54.034
Come on, Henry. He was just
trying to save his people.

36:54.035 --> 36:55.002
We all were.

36:55.003 --> 36:56.470
And now the troops can't get in

36:56.471 --> 36:58.439
because the warlords have
been bought off by the junta,

36:58.440 --> 37:00.040
and...

37:00.041 --> 37:04.744
that is how 50,000
innocent people get killed.

37:05.479 --> 37:09.016
So... you need someone to make the warlords

37:09.017 --> 37:10.818
a better offer.

37:10.819 --> 37:13.421
I think we know a guy.

37:13.422 --> 37:15.656
I'm not gonna do the
whole "Bless me, Father,

37:15.657 --> 37:16.924
for I have sinned" thing,

37:16.925 --> 37:19.292
so open up.

37:22.263 --> 37:25.266
Plenty of sin to go around, obviously.

37:25.267 --> 37:27.968
I didn't expect to see you again, Henry.

37:27.969 --> 37:29.136
Yeah, me either.

37:29.137 --> 37:31.038
And nothing has changed.
I'm here for Elizabeth.

37:31.039 --> 37:32.940
Fair enough.

37:32.941 --> 37:35.242
- Look, I need to know if
you can make a deal - Mm-hmm.

37:35.243 --> 37:36.777
with the warlords in your country.

37:36.778 --> 37:39.013
They let the African Union troops

37:39.014 --> 37:40.314
push through to St. Juste.

37:40.315 --> 37:42.817
In exchange, they get paid
by the U.S. Government,

37:42.818 --> 37:44.251
indirectly, through you.

37:44.252 --> 37:46.620
Is that something you
can make happen quickly?

37:46.621 --> 37:49.557
Well, it has been my experience that, uh,

37:49.558 --> 37:51.992
those warlords are quite businesslike.

37:51.993 --> 37:54.028
I'm glad to hear that. So can my wife.

37:54.029 --> 37:56.697
And you, too, apparently.

37:56.698 --> 37:58.766
Yes. I'm aware of the irony.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.901
Such is the world, Henry.

38:00.902 --> 38:04.839
Drowning in blood and irony.

38:04.840 --> 38:08.476
So, now, the Lord has made miracles

38:08.477 --> 38:11.144
with this blessed little device before.

38:12.646 --> 38:15.214
Let's see if He's with us today.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.684
African Union? African Union!

38:45.179 --> 38:47.547
_

38:55.256 --> 38:58.425
Okay, everyone, the African Union forces

38:58.426 --> 39:00.094
have stabilized St. Juste

39:00.095 --> 39:02.363
and they have set up aid
stations for the refugees.

39:02.364 --> 39:03.397
Yeah!

39:04.633 --> 39:06.133
This has been

39:06.134 --> 39:07.701
an incredibly long, tough week.

39:07.702 --> 39:09.336
Thank you all for your hard work.

39:09.337 --> 39:11.906
Do something nice for yourselves tonight.

39:11.907 --> 39:14.708
Madam Secretary, Ambassador
Bokassa is downstairs

39:14.709 --> 39:17.144
demanding to see you. Do
you want him sent away?

39:17.145 --> 39:19.146
Madam Secretary,

39:19.147 --> 39:21.715
I am here to officially protest
the United States' illegal

39:21.716 --> 39:24.385
and immoral intervention into our affairs.

39:24.386 --> 39:25.719
Really?

39:25.720 --> 39:29.356
Because I was thinking that
maybe your bosses back home

39:29.357 --> 39:31.892
are a little huffy at you
for falling down on the job,

39:31.893 --> 39:34.528
and you're looking to deal.

39:34.529 --> 39:37.998
It is true I have been recalled to the RWA,

39:37.999 --> 39:40.968
where I may face discipline. And, yes,

39:40.969 --> 39:43.604
I do know much about
the regime there that...

39:43.605 --> 39:46.874
could be very useful to you
and that I am willing to share.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.510
Well, I might have been
interested yesterday,

39:49.511 --> 39:51.779
but today I think I'll pass.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.847
You're very good at this game,

39:53.848 --> 39:56.650
Mr. Ambassador. I'm sure
you'll land on your feet.

39:56.651 --> 39:58.519
As to a deal,

39:58.520 --> 40:01.422
well, far be it from us

40:01.423 --> 40:04.857
to intervene in your country's affairs.

40:06.894 --> 40:09.262
Good luck.

40:13.334 --> 40:15.235
Knock, knock.

40:15.236 --> 40:16.270
Madam Secretary.

40:16.271 --> 40:19.573
Some day, huh?

40:19.574 --> 40:21.642
And how.

40:21.643 --> 40:24.244
I was just about to pour
myself a scotch to celebrate.

40:24.245 --> 40:25.779
Won't you care to join me?

40:25.780 --> 40:28.014
Sure, why not?

40:31.086 --> 40:33.654
Nadine, I came to tell
you I had you investigated.

40:33.655 --> 40:37.291
I figured as much.

40:37.292 --> 40:40.494
Lately, when I see Blake,

40:40.495 --> 40:44.698
he shakes like a Chihuahua
who's just peed on the carpet.

40:47.702 --> 40:49.470
So?

40:49.471 --> 40:51.071
Well,

40:51.072 --> 40:52.805
you're here, aren't you?

40:53.607 --> 40:56.110
There's something else,
something you're not

40:56.111 --> 40:57.277
gonna like very much.

40:57.278 --> 40:59.880
I'm having Vincent Marsh investigated next.

40:59.881 --> 41:02.549
I see.

41:02.550 --> 41:04.652
And why tell me this?

41:04.653 --> 41:08.187
Like I said, you're here, aren't you?

41:10.157 --> 41:12.391
So, cheers.

41:13.827 --> 41:15.829
To Julius Grossman.

41:15.830 --> 41:18.032
My mother's father.

41:18.033 --> 41:21.068
He was killed at Auschwitz.

41:22.537 --> 41:25.004
This was a good day at the office, ma'am.

41:35.482 --> 41:38.217
Hi. Surprise.

41:40.921 --> 41:43.424
Hello, Henry.

41:43.425 --> 41:46.126
I'm, uh, on my way to Rome for some, uh,

41:46.127 --> 41:48.696
disciplinary action,
you'll be glad to know.

41:48.697 --> 41:51.898
Elizabeth's convinced me
to come and say good-bye.

41:54.068 --> 41:56.103
Well, obviously I'm very happy

41:56.104 --> 41:58.005
that you brokered that deal, but...

41:58.006 --> 42:01.474
I'm not very interested in
salvaging this relationship.

42:04.611 --> 42:08.282
"There's nothing on this
earth more to be prized

42:08.283 --> 42:10.451
than a true friendship."

42:10.452 --> 42:12.553
That was Thomas...

42:12.554 --> 42:14.120
Yes, I know.

42:15.723 --> 42:17.858
Henry,

42:17.859 --> 42:20.994
you came to me in my darkest hour,

42:20.995 --> 42:23.831
and you were my true friend.

42:23.832 --> 42:27.667
Please forgive me for not being yours.

42:31.705 --> 42:33.807
How are your niece and her children?

42:33.808 --> 42:35.609
Komoyo and Esther

42:35.610 --> 42:37.845
and Simon... they're doing very well.

42:37.846 --> 42:40.848
Along with many others, thanks to you.

42:40.849 --> 42:43.050
Well, thanks to her.

42:43.051 --> 42:46.453
You don't have to go, you know.

42:46.454 --> 42:47.788
I can help you

42:47.789 --> 42:48.789
to stay here.

42:48.790 --> 42:50.324
That's very nice of you, but, uh,

42:50.325 --> 42:51.492
the church is my life.

42:51.493 --> 42:55.262
I am not afraid for whatever comes next.

42:55.263 --> 42:57.998
After all, uh, wasn't it, um...

42:57.999 --> 43:00.100
Thomas Aquinas who once said

43:00.101 --> 43:03.637

43:16.851 --> 43:21.054
Well, Au revoir, my friends.

43:21.055 --> 43:23.856
Au revoir, Laurent.

43:26.226 --> 43:28.428
Take care of yourself.

43:28.429 --> 43:30.297

43:30.298 --> 43:32.732
Ah.

43:34.501 --> 43:36.937
Hello? Don't be afraid.

43:36.938 --> 43:40.823
I'm here, I'm here. Do not be afraid.
