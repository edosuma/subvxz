00:05.606 --> 00:07.575
>> IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM,

00:07.608 --> 00:10.711
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.714
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.747 --> 00:15.549
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.583 --> 00:16.817
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.850 --> 00:19.120
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.288
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.423 --> 00:25.559
>> PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK VERSUS GILBERT KEPPLER

00:25.593 --> 00:27.228
ON COUNT ONE
OF THE INDICTMENT,

00:27.261 --> 00:29.163
AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ABUSE

00:29.197 --> 00:31.099
IN THE FOURTH DEGREE,

00:31.132 --> 00:31.799
HOW DOES THE JURY FIND
THE DEFENDANT?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.802
>> GUILTY.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.771
>> ON COUNT TWO,
AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ABUSE

00:37.805 --> 00:41.375
IN THE FOURTH DEGREE, HOW DO YOU
FIND THE DEFENDANT?

00:41.409 --> 00:42.576
>> GUILTY.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.179
>> ON COUNT THREE,
AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ABUSE

00:45.213 --> 00:48.516
IN THE FOURTH DEGREE, HOW DO YOU
FIND THE DEFENDANT?

00:48.549 --> 00:49.650

AND FINAL COUNT,

AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ABUSE
IN THE FOURTH DEGREE,

00:54.255 --> 00:55.656
HOW DO YOU FIND
THE DEFENDANT?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.125
>> GUILTY.

00:57.158 --> 01:01.362
>> MEMBERS OF THE JURY,
YOU ARE HEREBY EXCUSED.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.832
DR. KEPPLER, YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO THE COURT?

01:04.865 --> 01:07.535
>> I NEVER MEANT THESE YOUNG MEN
ANY HARM.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.370
>> YOUR HONOR, MOTION TO
CONTINUE THE DEFENDANT'S BAIL

01:09.403 --> 01:10.804
UNTIL SENTENCING.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.207
>> THE DEFENDANT HAS
A $9 MILLION FAMILY FORTUNE

01:13.241 --> 01:14.208
HE CAN USE TO SKIP TOWN.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.276
>> AS THE COURT KNOWS,

01:15.309 --> 01:18.446
DR. KEPPLER HAS GUARANTEED
HIS $1/2 MILLION BOND

01:18.479 --> 01:19.747
WITH HIS OWN MONEY.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.781
>> THEN WE'LL SPLIT THE BABY.

01:20.814 --> 01:24.285
BAIL IS CONTINUED,
BUT THE DEFENDANT WILL WEAR

01:24.318 --> 01:26.487
AN ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICE
AND BE CONFINED

01:26.520 --> 01:28.489
TO HIS HOME
UNTIL SENTENCING.

01:28.522 --> 01:31.492
WE'RE ADJOURNED.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.693
>> WHILE WE'RE GRATIFIED
BY TODAY'S RULING,

01:32.726 --> 01:35.296
WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THE LAW
LIMITS DR. KEPPLER'S SENTENCE

01:35.329 --> 01:37.298
TO ONLY 16 YEARS IN PRISON.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.567
HE NOT ONLY VIOLATED HIS OATH
AS A PEDIATRICIAN,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.369
BUT HE SHATTERED THE LIVES
OF FOUR BOYS

01:41.402 --> 01:42.803
AND THEIR FAMILIES.
>> EXCUSE ME. LET ME THROUGH.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.572
>> YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
MR. GRANGER?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.806
>> NO, I HAVE SOMETHING

01:45.839 --> 01:48.742
FOR CAPTAIN CRAGEN
AND HIS DETECTIVES.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.445
CONSIDER YOURSELF SERVED.
>> KEPPLER'S SUING US?

01:51.479 --> 01:53.247
>> ON WHAT GROUNDS?

01:53.281 --> 01:55.849
>> THE NYPD AND DENSLOW MEDICAL
CENTER KNEW MY CLIENT

01:55.883 --> 01:57.518
WAS SEXUALLY ABUSING
HIS VICTIMS

01:57.551 --> 02:00.854
LONG BEFORE THEY TOOK ACTION
TO STOP HIM.

02:00.888 --> 02:01.889
SEE YOU IN COURT.

02:01.922 --> 02:02.756
>> CAPTAIN CRAGEN, WHY DID
YOUR DETECTIVES WAIT

02:02.790 --> 02:05.359
TO ARREST DR. KEPPLER?
>> NO COMMENT.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.727
>> DETECTIVE BENSON,
ISN'T YOUR JOB

02:06.760 --> 02:08.329
TO KEEP KNOWN MOLESTERS
OFF THE STREETS?

02:08.362 --> 02:09.797
>> GOT ANY STATEMENTS,
DETECTIVE STABLER?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.031
>> YEAH, GET THE HELL
OUT OF OUR WAY.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.634
>> WHY'D YOU LET THAT DOCTOR
CONTINUE TO MOLEST THOSE BOYS?

02:13.667 --> 02:16.204
>> NO MORE QUESTIONS.
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU PEOPLE DO?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.288
>> THE BALLS ON THAT PERVERT
SUING US.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.789
AND HIS LAWYER'S GOT
A MATCHING PAIR,

03:08.822 --> 03:09.957
WALTZING
INTO OUR PRESS CONFERENCE.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.659
>> LIONEL GRANGER
IS A SORE LOSER.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.960
>> BUT COULD HE BE RIGHT?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.928
DID WE TAKE TOO LONG
TO BRING KEPPLER IN?

03:14.962 --> 03:16.364
>> WE PLAYED THIS ONE
STRAIGHT BY THE BOOK.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.899
>> GRANGER'S BLAMING US
TO SET UP DR. KEPPLER

03:18.932 --> 03:20.634
FOR A LIGHTER SENTENCE
IN APPEAL.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.570
THE DEPARTMENT
WILL INDEMNIFY US.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.839
>> I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.343
>> CIVIL SUITS AREN'T
I.A.B.'S JURISDICTION, TUCKER.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.811
>> UNLESS YOU PEOPLE SCREWED UP.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.681
>> WE NAILED KEPPLER
AND GOT A CONVICTION.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.815
>> THEN WHY DID THE COMMISSIONER
SEND ME TO CLEAN UP

03:34.848 --> 03:36.784
THE STEAMING PILE OF CRAP
YOU LEFT ON HIS DOORSTEP?

03:36.817 --> 03:37.818
>> I GUESS YOU'RE HIS GO-TO GUY.

03:37.851 --> 03:38.752
DID HE GIVE YOU A BAGGIE,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.488
OR DO YOU LIKE THE STENCH
ON YOUR HANDS?

03:40.521 --> 03:42.490
>> THE ONLY THING THAT REEKS
AROUND HERE

03:42.523 --> 03:44.425
IS HOW YOU HANDLED THIS CASE.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.559
>> ACCORDING
TO A CONVICTED CHILD MOLESTER

03:45.593 --> 03:47.361
AND HIS MEDIA WHORE LAWYER.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.862
WHY IS ONE-PP TAKING THEIR WORD
OVER OURS?

03:48.896 --> 03:53.033
>> BECAUSE KEPPLER'S LAST VICTIM
IS ON YOU.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.569
>> HOW DID THE PENCIL PUSHERS
DOWN AT THE PORCELAIN PALACE

03:55.603 --> 03:57.371
FIGURE THAT ONE?

03:57.405 --> 03:59.340
>> A 14-YEAR-OLD KID WALKED
IN HERE AND TOLD YOU

03:59.373 --> 04:01.309
HIS DOCTOR ABUSED HIM.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.444
YOU GAVE KEPPLER MORE TIME
TO DIDDLE ANOTHER VICTIM

04:03.477 --> 04:04.878
BECAUSE YOU WAITED THREE WEEKS
TO COLLAR HIM.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.480
>> BOY, YOU'VE BEEN
CHASING COPS SO LONG

04:06.514 --> 04:08.716
YOU FORGOT
HOW TO BE ONE.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.386
WE NEEDED THAT TIME IN ORDER
TO DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.354
>> YOU WERE DRAGGING ASS.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.456
WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK UP KEPPLER
RIGHT AWAY?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.357
>> BECAUSE HE NEVER RAPED

04:16.390 --> 04:19.360
ANY OF HIS VICTIMS,
SO WE HAD NO DNA.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.861
WE DIDN'T WANT HIM LAWYERING UP

04:20.894 --> 04:22.596
BEFORE WE HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO CHARGE HIM.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.931
>> WHAT MORE EVIDENCE
DO YOU NEED?

04:23.964 --> 04:26.334
THIS KID, JUSTIN MCTEAGUE,

04:26.367 --> 04:27.768
HE GAVE YOU KEPPLER
ON A SILVER PLATTER.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.638
>> ALL WE HAD WAS JUSTIN'S WORD
AGAINST THE DOCTOR,

04:30.671 --> 04:32.506
AND WE ALREADY HAD HISTORY
WITH JUSTIN.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.607
HE CAME IN HERE LAST YEAR
TELLING US

04:33.641 --> 04:35.443
THAT A TEACHER WAS ABUSING HIM.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.045
>> MY MATH TEACHER,
HE TOUCHED ME.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.413
>> WHERE'D HE TOUCH YOU,
JUSTIN?

04:39.447 --> 04:41.615
>> YOU KNOW.
MY JUNK.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.584
>> CAN YOU TELL US
HOW IT HAPPENED?

04:43.617 --> 04:48.055
>> HE MADE ME COME
TO REMEDIAL AFTER SCHOOL.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.523
WE WERE ALONE.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.493
HE WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME,
WATCHING ME WORK.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.629
TELLS ME HOW GOOD I'M DOING,
PATTING ME ON THE SHOULDER.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.698
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HIS HAND'S
IN BETWEEN MY LEGS.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.800
>> WHAT'D YOU DO?
>> PULLED AWAY.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.969
CALLED HIM A PERVERT.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.004
HE SAID IF I TOLD ANYONE,
HE'D FAIL ME FOR THE YEAR.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.574
>> JUSTIN GAVE US
HIS TEACHER'S NAME.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.675
KEVIN SAMMERS.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.943
WE IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT SAMMERS
IN FOR QUESTIONING.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.079
>> TALK TO MY COLLEAGUES,

05:12.112 --> 05:14.415
MY PRINCIPAL,
ANY STUDENT I EVER TAUGHT.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.616
>> OH, WE TALKED TO 'EM.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.419
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN?
NONE OF THEM STOOD UP FOR YOU.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.489
>> ACTUALLY, A COUPLE EVEN SAID
YOU WERE KIND OF PERVY.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.457
>> YOU'RE LYING.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.359
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE I NEVER LAID
A HAND ON ANY CHILD.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.494
>> OKAY, SO WHERE'S YOUR ALIBI?

05:26.527 --> 05:27.428
>> HOW CAN I GIVE YOU ONE

05:27.461 --> 05:29.397
IF YOU WON'T TELL ME
WHO SAYS I DID THIS?

05:29.430 --> 05:30.631
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.367
>> YOU FORGET INTERROGATION 101,
LIEUTENANT?

05:33.401 --> 05:34.702
HOLD BACK THE DETAILS,

05:34.735 --> 05:36.036
AND LET THE SUSPECT
BLURT THEM OUT.

05:36.069 --> 05:36.970
THEN YOU GOT HIM.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.539
>> HOW LONG
DID YOU INTERROGATE SAMMERS?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.408
>> 18 HOURS.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.009
>> HE EVER COP TO THE ABUSE?
>> NOPE.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.413
BUT WHEN WE FINALLY TOLD HIM
THE NAME OF HIS ACCUSER,

05:45.446 --> 05:46.914
HE PROVED
THAT WHAT JUSTIN TOLD US

05:46.947 --> 05:49.016
COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
>> WHAT IS THIS?

05:49.049 --> 05:52.586
>> THAT'S MR. SAMMERS
GETTING CASH AT EXACTLY THE TIME

05:52.620 --> 05:54.021
THAT YOU SAY HE ABUSED YOU.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.557
THE EXACT SAME DAY THAT
HE BUSTED YOU FOR SMOKING WEED

05:56.590 --> 05:58.459
OUTSIDE AT LUNCHTIME.
>> HE'S LYING.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.429
>> NO, JUSTIN, YOU ARE.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.863
SO NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE
MR. SAMMERS

06:02.896 --> 06:03.931
WHEN HE REPORTED YOU.

06:03.964 --> 06:08.569
>> I WAS SCARED.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.505
I WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPELLED,
AND MY PARENTS--

06:11.539 --> 06:12.640
MY PARENTS WOULD HAVE KILLED ME.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.508
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
OF THE DAMAGE

06:14.542 --> 06:16.844
THAT YOU'VE CAUSED THIS MAN?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.617
>> WHAT ABOUT THE TEACHER?

06:23.651 --> 06:25.953
>> SAMMERS QUIT TEACHING.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.788
HE COULDN'T TAKE THE WHISPERING
OR THE LOOKS

06:27.821 --> 06:29.923
WHEN HE WALKED DOWN THE HALL.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.091
HIS CAREER WAS DESTROYED

06:31.124 --> 06:33.026
BECAUSE JUSTIN MCTEAGUE
CRIED WOLF.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.595
>> AND WHEN HE ACCUSED KEPPLER
OF THE SAME CRIME,

06:34.628 --> 06:35.629
YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.631
YOU LET
ANOTHER KID BE VICTIMIZED.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.331
>> WE ARREST KEPPLER

06:38.365 --> 06:41.702
BASED SOLELY ON JUSTIN'S SAY-SO,

06:41.735 --> 06:44.037
THE DEFENSE NUKES
JUSTIN'S CREDIBILITY

06:44.071 --> 06:45.806
BECAUSE HE LIED BEFORE.

06:45.839 --> 06:49.042
AND I WAS NOT ABOUT TO LET
A JURY ACQUIT KEPPLER

06:49.076 --> 06:50.177
SO THAT HE COULD MOLEST
MORE BOYS.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.212
>> SO YOU TOLD BENSON
AND STABLER TO HIT THE BRAKES.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.882
>> NO, I TOLD BENSON AND STABLER
TO FIND ANOTHER VICTIM.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.619
BECAUSE ONE BOY IS NEVER ENOUGH
FOR A GUY LIKE KEPPLER.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.589
TOOK THREE WEEKS, BUT THAT'S
WHEN WE FOUND BRADLEY HICKS.

07:01.622 --> 07:05.058
>> CAN YOU TELL US WHAT
DR. KEPPLER DID TO YOU, BRADLEY?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.761
>> HE STUCK HIS FINGER
IN ME.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.698
THEN HE RUBBED
BETWEEN MY LEGS

07:10.731 --> 07:13.000
TILL I, YOU KNOW...

07:13.033 --> 07:15.669
>> DID HE TELL YOU
WHY HE DID THAT?

07:15.703 --> 07:19.607
>> HE SAID
IT WAS A PART OF MY TREATMENT.

07:19.640 --> 07:24.545
>> GIVE US A MINUTE.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.547
SAME STORY JUSTIN TOLD US
ALMOST WORD FOR WORD.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.581
>> THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.949
PICK HIM UP.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.853
>> GET OUT OF HERE.
I'M WITH A PATIENT.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.655
>> POLICE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?

07:34.688 --> 07:37.791
>> IT'S A PROCEDURE
TO RELIEVE THE PAIN

07:37.825 --> 07:38.959
FROM HIS URINARY TRACT
INFECTION.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.628
>> AND WHAT PROCEDURE IS THAT?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.996
>> URETHRAL MILKING.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.568
STEP AWAY FROM THE TABLE.
>> EXCUSE ME.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.468
>> PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.571
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR SEXUAL ABUSE.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.644
>> YOU OKAY?
>> YEAH, SURE.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.713
>> WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
>> CHUCK PAISLEY.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.549
WHO'D HE ABUSE?

08:01.582 --> 08:04.685
>> THAT KID CHUCK THOUGHT WHAT
KEPPLER DID TO HIM WAS LEGIT?

08:04.718 --> 08:05.686
>> SO DID THE FOURTH VICTIM,

08:05.719 --> 08:07.054
DALE OVERTON.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.289
HE ONLY CAME FORWARD WHEN HE SAW
KEPPLER IN CUFFS ON TV.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.125
TURNS OUT HE TREATED DALE
THE SAME DAY.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.728
WE FOUND HIS DNA
ON KEPPLER'S GLOVE

08:14.762 --> 08:16.730
IN THE SAME BAG OF GARBAGE.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.865
MADE HIS CONVICTION
A LOCK.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.867
>> WHICH NEVER WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED

08:19.900 --> 08:21.569
IF YOU HAD GONE FORWARD
ON JUSTIN'S WORD.

08:21.602 --> 08:25.639
>> OH, THANK GOD,
YOU FINALLY GET IT.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.911
>> TUCKER ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.814
BUT HE WANTS US
TO KEEP I.A.B. IN THE LOOP.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.948
>> IT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH RODENTS.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.618
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU GOT RID
OF 'EM, THEY COME BACK.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.253
>> WHICH IS WHY ANYTHING MORE
ON KEPPLER GOES THROUGH ME.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.454
>> IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE HERE THEN

08:41.488 --> 08:43.657
BECAUSE WHILE YOU THREE WERE
ENTERTAINING THE RAT SQUAD,

08:43.691 --> 08:45.726
FIN AND I ARE ACTUALLY WORKING.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.761
WE PULLED THE PAPERS
ON KEPPLER'S LAWSUIT

08:47.795 --> 08:48.762
AGAINST DENSLOW HOSPITAL.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.064
>> READ 'EM AND WEEP,
CAPTAIN.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.634
KEPPLER CLAIMS DENSLOW KNEW
HE WAS MOLESTING BOYS

08:53.667 --> 08:54.635
A YEAR BEFORE WE DID.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.603
>> A YEAR?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.304
HOW THE HELL CAN A HOSPITAL
NOT REPORT THAT?

08:57.337 --> 08:58.772
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE B.S.
TO ME.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.708
I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY
A BIG HMO LIKE DENSLOW

09:00.741 --> 09:02.209
IS GONNA RISK THE STATE YANKING
THEIR LICENSE.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.111
>> OR BEING CHARGED
AS AN ACCESSORY

09:04.144 --> 09:05.713
FOR ALLOWING THE ABUSE
TO CONTINUE.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.814
>> TALK TO THE HOSPITAL.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.917
SEE WHAT KEPPLER AND
HIS SHYSTER LAWYER ARE UP TO.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.187
>> I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT DR. KEPPLER.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.724
>> YOU'RE THE HOSPITAL'S
ATTORNEY, MR. COLDWELL.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.725
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.558
>> STILL, IT'S COMPANY POLICY

09:18.592 --> 09:20.093
NOT TO DISCUSS
PENDING LITIGATION.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.663
IF I DO, THEN DR. KEPPLER'S
ATTORNEYS CAN FIND OUT,

09:22.696 --> 09:23.964
AND THEY COULD SUBPOENA
YOUR NOTES...

09:23.997 --> 09:26.033
>> THIS IS NOT
A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.637
KEPPLER CLAIMS YOU LET HIM
SEXUALLY ABUSE THOSE FOUR BOYS.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.104
>> LIKE THAT OTHER HOSPITAL
IN CALIFORNIA

09:31.138 --> 09:33.040
WITH ANOTHER DOCTOR YEARS AGO?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.108
LOOK, I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN HERE.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.777
WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.845
>> REALLY? 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'RE PROTECTING

09:37.878 --> 09:38.846
YOUR ASSETS,
NOT YOUR PATIENTS.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.648
>> LIKE I SAID BEFORE,

09:40.681 --> 09:41.915
WE'RE NOT HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.116
THANK YOU, DETECTIVES.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.720
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN A LAWYER'S LYING?

09:46.754 --> 09:47.721
>> UH, WHEN HIS LIPS ARE MOVING.

09:47.755 --> 09:48.689
HE KNOWS
THERE WAS A COVER-UP.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.191
>> WE GOTTA FIND SOMEONE
WHO WILL COME CLEAN.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.893
>> LET'S ASK KEPPLER.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.796
>> WE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR HIM
WITHOUT HIS LAWYER PRESENT.

09:55.829 --> 09:56.596
>> SURE, WE CAN.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.931
IF THE HOSPITAL COMMITTED
A CRIME,

09:57.965 --> 09:59.700
HE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.806
>> KEPPLER'S GONNA TELL US
TO PISS OFF.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.741
>> WELL, HE'S GOT A COUPLE
OF MILLION REASONS NOT TO.

10:07.775 --> 10:11.712
>> WHAT, SO NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE
THIS PERV EVEN RICHER?

10:11.745 --> 10:13.847
>> LOOK DOWN.

10:13.881 --> 10:17.851
>> BLOOD.
AND THE DOOR'S OPEN.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.664
>> SO MUCH FOR THE LAWSUIT.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.836
>> SPLATTER MARKS EVERYWHERE.
IT'S ALMOST DRY.

10:35.869 --> 10:40.040
KILLER'S LONG GONE.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.042
>> MANHATTAN SVU TO CENTRAL.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.877
WE HAVE A HOMICIDE

10:43.911 --> 10:45.212
AT 632 EAST 67.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.081
I NEED ADDITIONAL UNITS,
CSU, AND THE M.E.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.752
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?
>> CRAGEN.

10:51.785 --> 10:56.323
ONE-PP AND THE PRESS,
THEY'RE GONNA BE ALL OVER THIS.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.325
>> HEY, BENSON,
WHAT'S THE HOLDUP?

10:58.358 --> 10:59.793
I GOTTA SET UP
THE SCAN STATION.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.862
>> JUST HANG TIGHT
TILL WE GIVE THE OKAY.

11:01.895 --> 11:02.996
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
JUST GET HERE

11:03.030 --> 11:04.097
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.899
>> WHERE'S WARNER?

11:05.933 --> 11:07.000
>> CRANE COLLAPSE IN THE BRONX.
SIX DEAD.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.336
SAYS SHE'S AT LEAST
TWO HOURS OUT.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.139
>> I HEAR DR. KEPPLER CAME DOWN
WITH A CASE OF JUSTICE PREVAILS.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.407
>> MORE LIKE SOMEONE SAVED
THE STATE A COUPLE MILLION BUCKS

11:14.441 --> 11:15.776
AND A PRISON CELL.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.711
WHAT ARE WE WAITING ON?
>> CRAGEN.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.913
SAYS WE DON'T TOUCH THE PLACE
UNTIL GREYLEK SEES IT.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.314
JUST IN CASE I.A.B. WANTS
TO SCREW WITH US AGAIN.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.883
>> YOU SURE
GREYLEK'S NOT ON ONE

11:22.916 --> 11:26.854
OF HER "I GOTTA BE
AT THE CRIME SCENE" CRUSADES?

11:26.887 --> 11:27.921
>> THAT'S NOT GREYLEK.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.893
>> ALEX.

11:32.926 --> 11:36.063
>> WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.307
>> WHERE'S GREYLEK?

11:47.340 --> 11:50.343
>> NEW ADMINISTRATION CALLED HER
BACK TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.845
D.A. LET HER LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.847
>> AND MCCOY DRAFTED YOU
TO FILL IN.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.448
>> I WASN'T DRAFTED.
JACK ASKED ME.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.150
>> NO ONE TOLD US ABOUT IT.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.019
>> I ONLY ACCEPTED
AN HOUR AGO.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.888
>> WE NEVER THOUGHT
WE'D SEE YOU AGAIN.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.290
>> I GOT YOUR MESSAGES.

12:03.323 --> 12:07.961
I PICK UP THE PHONE TO CALL YOU
AND REMEMBER...

12:07.995 --> 12:09.496
>> THAT WE WERE THERE
WHEN YOU WERE SHOT?

12:09.529 --> 12:12.365
>> WE HEARD VELEZ DIED
IN PRISON

12:12.399 --> 12:14.334
AND CONNORS WAS EXTRADITED
TO IRELAND.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.336
YOU'VE BEEN OUT
OF WITNESS PROTECTION

12:16.369 --> 12:18.171
FOR THREE YEARS.

12:18.205 --> 12:23.143
>> YOU GUYS WANT
TO GET STARTED?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.177
>> LET'S GO.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.081
>> BIG GUN.
.45.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.417
>> YEAH,
BUT THAT DIDN'T KILL HIM.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.052
BIG BETTY DID.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.954
>> NINE SLUGS NOT ENOUGH?
>> NOPE.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.889
YOUR PERP WAS A LOUSY SHOT.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.891
WE DUG PROJECTILES OUT

12:37.925 --> 12:40.260
OF THE WALLS, FURNITURE,
CEILING, FLOOR.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.862
HE MISSED EIGHT TIMES.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.497
>> GOT LUCKY ONCE.
>> YEAH, WITH THE FIRST SHOT.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.200
CHECK OUT THE SCAN STATION.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.369
>> HIT KEPPLER
IN THE RIGHT KNEE.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.503
ENOUGH TO IMMOBILIZE HIM.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.973
BUT WHY ONLY NINE SHOTS?

12:53.006 --> 12:53.807
>> RAN OUT OF AMMO.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.575
HE SAW KEPPLER
WAS STILL BREATHING.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.709
HE GRABBED THE CLUB.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.146
HE FINISHED OFF THE DOC
WHILE WORKING ON HIS HANDICAP.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.380
>> EXPLAINS THE SPATTER
ON THE CEILING

13:00.413 --> 13:02.115
FURTHEST AWAY FROM THE BODY,

13:02.149 --> 13:03.483
BUT THE STREAKS
RIGHT ABOVE KEPPLER

13:03.516 --> 13:05.152
HAD TO HAVE BEEN MADE
BY THE SHORTER OBJECT.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.519
MAYBE THE GUN.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.921
>> IT'S TOO BAD THE PERP
COULDN'T HAVE LEFT THAT.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.923
>> YEAH, ALL HE LEFT
WAS THIS PAIR OF GLOVES,

13:09.957 --> 13:13.293
EXPLAINS THE DOZENS OF USELESS
BLOODY SMUDGES WE FOUND.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.928
PROBABLY WEARING THEM
BECAUSE OF THE COLD.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.530
>> SORRY TO SPOIL YOUR FUN,
BUT CAPTAIN'S CALLING.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.966
>> YOU KNOW,
THIS WAS A LOT OF OVERKILL.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.934
>> SOMEBODY WANTED KEPPLER
TO SUFFER.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.535
>> SOMEONE KEPPLER KNEW
WELL ENOUGH TO LET IN.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.736
NO FORCED ENTRY.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.239
>> SO YOU THINK IT WAS ONE
OF THE FOUR BOYS HE MOLESTED?

13:26.273 --> 13:28.041
>> OR ONE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS
WHO DECIDED

13:28.075 --> 13:29.209
HE DESERVED
THE DEATH PENALTY.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.478
>> HOPEFULLY, CSU WILL FIND
HIS DNA IN THERE SOMEWHERE

13:31.511 --> 13:33.046
AND WE'LL COMPARE IT
TO THE BOYS' DNA WE GOT

13:33.080 --> 13:34.247
FROM KEPPLER'S TRIAL.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.482
>> NOT WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS'
PERMISSION.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.984
>> IT'S EVIDENCE, ALEX.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.052
THOSE BOYS GAVE THEIR DNA
VOLUNTARILY.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.988
>> AS SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.422
JUDGE MOREDOCK SEALED IT
AFTER THE TRIAL

13:42.455 --> 13:43.590
TO PROTECT THE BOYS.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.058
IF I'M GOING TO ASK HIM
TO UNSEAL IT,

13:45.092 --> 13:46.059
HE'S GONNA WANNA KNOW

13:46.093 --> 13:46.927
WE HAVE THEIR FULL COOPERATION.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.295
>> OUR ONLY OPTION THEN
IS TO GO BACK

13:48.328 --> 13:49.997
AND INTERVIEW
THE FAMILIES AGAIN.

13:50.030 --> 13:50.931
>> I FORGOT WHAT IT FELT LIKE

13:50.964 --> 13:52.933
HAVING YOU KICKING
OUR ASSES, COUNSELOR.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.534
>> ALEX'S FOOT'LL BE
THE LEAST OF OUR PROBLEMS

13:54.567 --> 13:57.270
IF A PISSED-OFF PARENT
GOES RUNNING TO THE PRESS.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.438
BE GENTLE.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.109
>> AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

14:02.142 --> 14:03.310
NOW YOU'RE ACCUSING MY SON
OF MURDER?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.913
>> NO, MRS. MCTEAGUE, BUT WE
HAVE TO RULE EVERYBODY OUT.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.147
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU AND JUSTIN WENT

14:07.180 --> 14:08.248
YESTERDAY AFTER COURT?

14:08.281 --> 14:10.383
>> MY SISTER'S ON STATEN ISLAND

14:10.417 --> 14:11.384
TO TOAST THE VERDICT.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.452
>> AND HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE?

14:12.485 --> 14:13.887
>> WE STAYED THE NIGHT.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.423
I TOASTED A FEW TOO MANY TIMES
TO DRIVE HOME.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.025
>> DID ANY OF THE OTHER BOYS
OR THEIR PARENTS

14:18.058 --> 14:20.060
SEEM ANGRY ENOUGH
TO KILL DR. KEPPLER?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.494
>> THE WHOLE LOT OF US

14:21.528 --> 14:22.595
ARE MAD AS HELL.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.364
BUT YOU'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.299
WE DIDN'T WANT HIS LIFE.
WE WANTED HIS MONEY.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.036
'CAUSE NONE OF US ARE GONNA GET
A DIME OUT OF DENSLOW HOSPITAL.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.003
>> WHY NOT?

14:30.037 --> 14:32.339
>> BECAUSE WE ALL SIGNED
ARBITRATION PAPERS.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.176
>> YOU AGREED NOT TO SUE DENSLOW
FOR MALPRACTICE?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.979
>> SOME SUIT TOLD US
THAT IF WE DIDN'T SIGN,

14:39.012 --> 14:41.281
DR. KEPPLER COULDN'T TREAT
OUR KIDS ANYMORE.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.051
WE TRUSTED HIM.
HE WAS A GOOD DOCTOR.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.019
>> YOU WEREN'T CONCERNED
ABOUT SIGNING YOUR RIGHTS AWAY?

14:46.053 --> 14:47.020
>> YEAH.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.655
AND WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.423
>> WHO ELSE?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.092
>> LILLIAN SIEFELD.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.226
KEPPLER'S HEAD NURSE
FOR YEARS.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.097
SHE TOLD US NOT TO SIGN.
THEN SHE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.131
WE WERE TOLD
SHE GOT PROMOTED.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.100
>> LILLIAN!

15:00.133 --> 15:02.702
SERGEANT JOHN MUNCH,
NYPD.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.704
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT DR. KEPPLER.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.706
>> BUT THE JURY FOUND HIM
GUILTY.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.441
HE'S DEAD.
WHY NOW?

15:08.475 --> 15:09.943
>> BECAUSE UNTIL TODAY,
WE NEVER HEARD ABOUT YOU.

15:09.977 --> 15:10.777
ANY IDEA WHY?

15:10.810 --> 15:15.015
>> THEY MUST HAVE ERASED
THE RECORDS.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.049
LISTEN, IF THEY SEE ME
TALKING TO YOU--

15:16.083 --> 15:17.617
>> IF WHO SEES US TALKING,
LILLIAN?

15:17.650 --> 15:18.718
>> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.956
HE SAID THEY WOULD TAKE AWAY
MY JOB AND MY PENSION.

15:22.990 --> 15:23.790
>> HE?

15:23.823 --> 15:26.426
IS THIS THE MAN
WHO THREATENED YOU?

15:26.459 --> 15:29.963
>> YES, THAT'S COLDWELL.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.131
OH, I'M SORRY.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.600
I SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.168
>> YOU KNEW
WHAT DR. KEPPLER WAS DOING.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.403
>> NO.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.072
DR. KEPPLER ALWAYS HAD ONE OF US
CHAPERONE

15:39.106 --> 15:42.109
WHEN HE WAS EXAMINING
A FEMALE PATIENT.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.144
BUT ON THIS DAY,
IT WAS VERY, VERY BUSY,

15:44.177 --> 15:46.446
WE HAD TWO NURSES OUT,
AND I GOT ALL MIXED UP,

15:46.479 --> 15:49.182
AND I JUST WALKED
INTO THE WRONG ROOM.

15:49.216 --> 15:52.986
AND I SAW DR. KEPPLER
WITH DALE OVERTON.

15:53.020 --> 15:57.991
HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS
AT THE TRIAL.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.126
AND I SAW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

15:59.159 --> 16:02.229
>> HE MOLESTED THAT BOY,
AND YOU DID NOTHING TO STOP IT.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.998
>> BUT I DID WHAT I THOUGHT
I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

16:05.032 --> 16:08.135
I WENT TO THE WOMAN
AT THE HUMAN RESOURCES.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.503
I REPORTED IT.
>> SO SHE BROUGHT COLDWELL IN?

16:10.537 --> 16:13.006
>> YES, AND HE BROUGHT ME
RIGHT UPSTAIRS

16:13.040 --> 16:14.207
AND HE SAID,
"THE HOSPITAL TAKES THIS

16:14.241 --> 16:15.475
VERY SERIOUSLY."

16:15.508 --> 16:17.077
AND I SAID, "YOU HAVE
TO CONFRONT KEPPLER."

16:17.110 --> 16:18.578
>> DID HE?
>> NO.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.413
HE SAID THAT KEPPLER WOULD JUST
DENY EVERYTHING.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.583
THAT IT WAS MY WORD
AGAINST HIS WORD.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.653
AND THAT IF IT WAS NOT TRUE,
HE WOULD JUST SUE THE HOSPITAL.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.123
>> SO COLDWELL
DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

16:31.724 --> 16:36.396
>> NO, HE--HE DID BELIEVE ME.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.331
BUT HE DIDN'T THINK
THE JURY WOULD BELIEVE ME.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.201
>> LILLIAN, WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
TO US?

16:41.234 --> 16:45.172
>> WELL, I THREATENED
TO COME TO YOU,

16:45.205 --> 16:47.140
BUT COLDWELL SAID
IF I WENT TO THE POLICE,

16:47.174 --> 16:49.809
THAT HE WOULD MAKE SURE
THEY TOOK AWAY MY JOB

16:49.842 --> 16:54.047
AND MY HEALTH INSURANCE,
AND MY HUSBAND IS SICK.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.783
AND I JUST DID NOT KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.685
>> DENSLOW HOSPITAL DIDN'T GIVE
A DAMN

16:58.718 --> 17:00.753
THAT KEPPLER WAS ABUSING
THOSE BOYS.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.156
ALL THEY CARED ABOUT
WAS PLUGGING POTENTIAL LEAKS.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.158
>> AND LOGAN COLDWELL
WAS THEIR PLUMBER.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.094
HE KNEW KEPPLER
WAS A PEDOPHILE

17:07.127 --> 17:08.361
AND DIDN'T CALL US.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.662
WE CAN COLLAR HIM
FOR OBSTRUCTION.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.098
>> NO, WE CAN'T.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.799
HE WAS THE HOSPITAL'S ATTORNEY,
SO TECHNICALLY,

17:12.832 --> 17:13.933
KEPPLER WAS ALSO HIS CLIENT.

17:13.966 --> 17:16.369
>> A LAWYER KNOWS HIS CLIENT IS
GOING TO COMMIT A CRIME,

17:16.403 --> 17:17.504
HE'S GOT TO TELL SOMEBODY.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.606
>> WELL, THAT GIVES HIM
THE CHOICE TO BREAK PRIVILEGE,

17:19.639 --> 17:20.607
NOT AN OBLIGATION.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.342
>> SO WE CAN'T TOUCH COLDWELL.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.543
>> NOT FOR THAT.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.745
BUT WE HAVE HIM ON ONE COUNT
OF OBSTRUCTION

17:25.778 --> 17:26.779
FOR BUYING LILLIAN'S SILENCE.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.181
AND THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.616
I'LL HAVE THE ARREST WARRANT
DRAWN UP

17:29.649 --> 17:31.484
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.552
WHERE ARE WE
ON KEPPLER'S MURDER?

17:32.585 --> 17:33.820
>> CIRCLING THE BOWL.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.289
ALL FOUR VICTIMS
AND RELEVANT FAMILY MEMBERS

17:36.323 --> 17:38.091
HAVE AIRTIGHT ALIBIS.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.792
>> AUTOPSY REPORT IN YET?
>> YEAH, CAME IN AN HOUR AGO.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.263
KEPPLER DIED
AT APPROXIMATELY 1:00 A.M.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.097
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.865
WARNER FOUND TRACES
OF GOLD PLATING

17:45.898 --> 17:47.267
IN HIS HEAD WOUND.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.469
>> THAT DIDN'T COME
FROM THE GOLF CLUB.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.571
>> BUT CSU GOT SKIN CELLS
OFF THE GLOVES.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.839
WARNER GOT
A WHOLE BUNCH OF HITS.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.674
ONLY ONE OF THEM'S NOT IN JAIL.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.309
>> WHICH ONE DID IT?
>> NONE OF 'EM.

17:56.343 --> 18:00.313
DNA BELONGS TO A CLIVE LYNWOOD.
LIVES ON 5th AVENUE.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.415
WITH HIS REGISTERED HANDGUN.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.255
[knock at door]

18:08.288 --> 18:09.289
>> HI.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.490
>> HI.
>> MY NAME IS JEFF.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.192
ARE YOU THE POLICE?

18:12.225 --> 18:15.128
>> DETECTIVES BENSON
AND STABLER.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.296
IS CLIVE LYNWOOD HOME?

18:16.329 --> 18:17.730
>> MY DAD AND MOM WENT OUT.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.731
I JUST GOT HOME FROM WORK.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.733
>> THIS IS A WARRANT
TO SEARCH

18:20.767 --> 18:22.235
YOUR APARTMENT.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.337
>> WOW.

18:24.371 --> 18:27.340
UM, DO YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU?

18:27.374 --> 18:31.211
>> THAT'D BE GREAT.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.312
HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR DAD'S GUN?

18:32.345 --> 18:34.481
>> YEAH.
IT'S REALLY COOL.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.216
>> YOU KNOW
WHERE HE KEEPS IT?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.385
>> YEAH, RIGHT IN THERE.
IN A SPECIAL BOX.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.190
>> IT'S EMPTY.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.358
>> UH-OH.

18:45.392 --> 18:46.259
>> DOES YOUR DAD CARRY THE GUN
WITH HIM?

18:46.293 --> 18:48.228
>> NO, HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.263
>> WHAT COLOR IS THE GUN,
JEFF?

18:50.297 --> 18:51.564
>> GOLD.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.600
DAD SAYS IT'S REAL.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.268
>> WHAT THE HELL'S HAPPENING
HERE?

18:55.302 --> 18:56.469
>> DAD, THE POLICE ARE HERE.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.238
>> AND WHERE'S MY GUN?
>> YOU TELL US.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.173
PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.908
>> EXCUSE ME?
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:01.941 --> 19:03.343
>> CLIVE LYNWOOD,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR MURDER.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.911
>> MURDER?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

19:04.944 --> 19:06.913
WHO'D I KILL?
>> TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.415
>> YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT...

19:08.448 --> 19:09.749
>> NO. COME BACK.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.384
PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY DAD
TO JAIL.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.885
PLEASE DON'T
TAKE MY DAD TO JAIL.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.427
>> ALEX!

19:20.460 --> 19:22.362
APPEALS GET SO BORING,
YOU CAME BACK

19:22.395 --> 19:23.563
FOR MORE SEXCAPADES?

19:23.596 --> 19:24.564
>> AH, I'M JUST A TEMP,
LORNA.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.499
YOUR CLIENT,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

19:26.533 --> 19:28.435
IS LOOKING AT LIFE
WITHOUT PAROLE.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.837
>> [tsks]
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY FOR TOO LONG.

19:30.870 --> 19:35.475
LOST YOUR TOUCH.
MR. LYNWOOD IS INNOCENT.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.877
>> THEN MR. LYNWOOD CAN EXPLAIN
WHY HIS .45 IS SUDDENLY MISSING.

19:37.910 --> 19:38.878
>> YOU THINK
HE'S THE ONLY RICH GUY IN TOWN

19:38.911 --> 19:40.513
WITH A GOLD-PLATED HANDGUN?

19:40.547 --> 19:41.848
>> NO, I THINK HE'S THE ONLY GUY
IN TOWN

19:41.881 --> 19:44.351
WHOSE DNA WAS ON THE GLOVES
WE FOUND AT THE SCENE.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.853
>> AND THE ONLY REASON
HIS DNA IS IN THE DATABASE

19:46.886 --> 19:49.522
IS BECAUSE HE WAS CONVICTED
OF A FELONY.

19:49.556 --> 19:53.493
>> YOU MUST BE TALKING ABOUT
THAT BOGUS MENACING CHARGE.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.561
TELL THEM, CLIVE.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.330
>> WELL, I WAS ON MY WAY BACK
FROM THE HAMPTONS.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.733
AND A TROOPER PULLS ME OVER,
ASKS ME TO TAKE A DEE-WEE TEST.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.904
AND I MADE A SILLY JOKE
ABOUT HIM HAVING A THING

20:04.937 --> 20:06.473
AGAINST PEOPLE
WHO DRIVE MASERATIS,

20:06.506 --> 20:09.376
AND HE GOT ALL PISSY.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.544
>> WELL, MAYBE HE GOT PISSY
BECAUSE OF THE 2.2

20:11.578 --> 20:13.613
YOU BLEW
INTO THE BREATHALYZER.

20:15.515 --> 20:19.786
>> HE SEES MY SWISS ARMY KNIFE
SITTING IN THE CONSOLE

20:19.819 --> 20:23.456
BETWEEN THE TWO SEATS AND SAYS,
BECAUSE OF MY SO-CALLED WEAPON,

20:23.490 --> 20:24.524
HE CAN UP THE DUI

20:24.557 --> 20:26.626
TO A MENACING CHARGE

20:26.659 --> 20:28.895
AND TAKE MY DNA.
>> FASCINATING.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.564
>> NOW EXPLAIN
HOW YOUR DNA GOT

20:31.598 --> 20:33.032
INTO GILBERT KEPPLER'S
BROWNSTONE.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.867
>> AH, HERE'S THE FUN PART.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.936
WE DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.806
SEE YOU IN COURT.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.043
>> MS. CABOT, DO YOU
HAVE AN APPLICATION?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.778
>> YES.
REMAND WITHOUT BAIL.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.481
>> YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE HAVE
NO VALID EVIDENCE

20:48.515 --> 20:49.782
WITH WHICH TO PROCEED.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.584
>> SEEMS VALID TO ME,
MS. SCARRY.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.886
ACCORDING TO THE ARRESTING
OFFICER'S DEPOSITION,

20:53.920 --> 20:56.856
YOUR CLIENT'S DNA WAS FOUND
AT THE SCENE.

20:56.889 --> 21:00.527
>> 13 GENETIC MARKERS IS THE
STANDARD FOR DNA IDENTIFICATION.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.062
MR. LYNWOOD WAS ID'D
WITH ONLY 5 1/2.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.364
>> THAT MEANS
THAT THERE'S

21:04.397 --> 21:05.565
A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE

21:05.598 --> 21:06.966
THAT SOMEONE ELSE MURDERED
GILBERT KEPPLER.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.469
>> IF YOU COMPARE
THOSE FIVE MARKERS

21:09.502 --> 21:11.604
TO JUST ONE RANDOMLY SELECTED
PERSON.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.407
BUT COMPARED
TO ALL 300,000 PROFILES

21:14.441 --> 21:15.708
IN THE STATE'S DNA DATABANK,

21:15.742 --> 21:16.743
THOSE CHANCES DROP

21:16.776 --> 21:18.611
TO ONE IN THREE.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.612
>> WHICH MEANS WHAT,
MS. SCARRY?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.448
>> THAT OF THE DOZEN
OR SO MEN

21:21.481 --> 21:24.484
IN THIS ROOM,
IT IS JUST AS POSSIBLE

21:24.517 --> 21:28.588
THAT HE MURDERED DR. KEPPLER
OR HIM

21:28.621 --> 21:30.590
OR THAT GENTLEMAN,
WHO'S ACTUALLY

21:30.623 --> 21:32.792
FROM THE FBI'S
OWN DNA ADVISORY BOARD

21:32.825 --> 21:34.661
AND WILL BACK ME UP
ON THIS.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.696
>> YOUR HONOR,
THE COURTS HAVE NEVER RULED

21:36.729 --> 21:38.565
AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT
ON THIS ISSUE.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.666
>> I'M SORRY, MS. CABOT.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.534
THERE'S ALWAYS A FIRST TIME.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.003
WE HAVE BEEN BURNED
BY FAULTY DNA BEFORE.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.005
I'M THROWING IT OUT.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.940
>> THERE IS NO OTHER EVIDENCE
LINKING MY CLIENT

21:47.974 --> 21:49.509
TO THIS HORRIBLE CRIME.
>> YOUR HONOR, IT'S--

21:49.542 --> 21:50.510
>> I'M DISMISSING THE CHARGES.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.646
MR. LYNWOOD, YOU ARE FREE TO GO.
>> THANK YOU.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.682
>> TEN MINUTE RECESS.
[pounds gavel]

22:00.152 --> 22:02.655
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK,
ALEXANDRA.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.458
TRY TO SHOW UP PREPARED
NEXT TIME.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.995
>> YES, JUDGE.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.598
>> ALEX, THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.633
>> YES, IT IS.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.569
WE HAVE CLIVE LYNWOOD'S DNA,
AND HE'S WALKING OUT OF HERE.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.638
>> I'LL TRY TO FIND
SOMETHING ELSE LINKING HIM

22:18.671 --> 22:19.338
TO KEPPLER.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.140
>> I WENT OVER EVERYTHING AGAIN.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.475
NO MORE DNA.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.843
AND THE ONLY THING
I DID FIND

22:23.876 --> 22:24.911
ISN'T GONNA BE MUCH HELP.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.613
>> WE'LL TAKE
WHATEVER YOU GOT.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.048
>> THIS SPENT .45 SHELL CASING
IS THE SAME BRAND OF AMMO

22:29.081 --> 22:30.049
OUR SHOOTER USED.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.050
I PUT MY FINGERPRINT ON IT.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.420
>> I DON'T SEE IT.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.888
>> NOW HERE'S A CASING
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.557
>> IT LOOKS LIKE THE
FINGERPRINT'S ETCHED INTO IT.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.559
>> IT IS. HEAT OF THE GUNPOWDER
IGNITING CAUSED THE OILS

22:39.592 --> 22:41.628
IN THE PRINT
TO CORRODE THE METAL.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.530
>> SO OUR PERP WASN'T WEARING
GLOVES WHEN HE LOADED THE GUN.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.598
>> TOO BAD
THE PRINT'S NOT IN THE SYSTEM.

22:45.632 --> 22:46.966
>> SO WHY ISN'T
YOUR PRINT ETCHED IN?

22:46.999 --> 22:49.636
>> 'CAUSE I'M A VEGETARIAN.
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:49.669 --> 22:51.170
VEGETARIANS LEAVE PRINTS TOO.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.673
>> FINGERPRINTS ARE
CHEMICAL SECRETIONS.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.607
WE SECRETE WHAT WE EAT.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.643
MY PRINTS ARE LESS LIKELY
TO CORRODE METAL

22:56.676 --> 22:58.110
'CAUSE MY DIET'S LOW
IN SODIUM.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.012
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME
OUR PERP'S PRINTS ARE BURNT

23:00.046 --> 23:02.114
INTO THAT SHELL CASING
BECAUSE HE EATS TOO MUCH SALT?

23:02.148 --> 23:03.650
>> OR WORKS AROUND IT.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.685
>> LIKE AT A FAST FOOD
RESTAURANT.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.987
LAST NIGHT
WHEN WE COLLARED CLIVE,

23:08.020 --> 23:10.490
HIS SON WAS WEARING
A HAPPIBURGER UNIFORM.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.124
>> EXPLAINS WHY CLIVE CAME UP
IN THE SYSTEM.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.827
HIS SON SHARES HALF HIS DNA.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.596
>> MM.
[slurps]

23:16.629 --> 23:18.631
WOW, THAT WAS FUN.

23:18.665 --> 23:21.968
I NEVER RODE
IN A POLICE CAR BEFORE.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.570
I'M EMPTY.
HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.439
>> HERE. I WILL.
THERE'S A TRASH CAN OUTSIDE.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.641
>> HAVE A SEAT.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.610
SO, JEFF, WHAT DO YOU DO
AT HAPPIBURGER?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.011
>> CLEAN UP.

23:32.044 --> 23:35.648
MY BOSS SAYS, NEXT YEAR,
MAYBE I CAN BE A GRILL MAN.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.717
>> DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WE DO HERE?

23:37.750 --> 23:38.718
>> YOU CATCH PEOPLE

23:38.751 --> 23:41.854
WHO DO BAD THINGS.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.155
AM I IN TROUBLE?

23:43.189 --> 23:46.158
AM I GOING TO JAIL?

23:46.192 --> 23:48.528
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE
MY FINGERPRINTS?

23:48.561 --> 23:51.030
>> IF YOU DID SOMETHING BAD.
DID YOU DO SOMETHING BAD?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.565
>> NO.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.201
I DON'T WANT MY MOM AND DAD
TO YELL AT ME.

23:55.234 --> 23:59.038
>> LIKE IF YOU TOOK
YOUR DAD'S GUN?

23:59.071 --> 24:00.740
>> MY DAD'S GUN IS NOT A TOY.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.609
I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH IT
IF HE IS NOT THERE.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.911
>> YOUR DAD EVER LET YOU
TOUCH IT?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.079
>> SURE.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.114
HE LET ME PUT THE BULLETS IN.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.549
HE TOOK ME TO THE RANGE

24:09.582 --> 24:12.218
SO I COULD SHOOT IT.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.120
BAM, BAM,

24:14.153 --> 24:15.655
BAM.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.223
I SHOT THE MAN ON THE PAPER

24:17.256 --> 24:18.691
AND MADE TWO HOLES IN HIM.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.627
>> WHERE'S YOUR DAD KEEP
HIS BULLETS?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.929
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU.
IT'S A SECRET.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.031
>> I'M PRETTY GOOD
WITH SECRETS.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.699
YOU CAN TELL ME.

24:29.769 --> 24:33.039
>> IN HIS CLOSET.
UNDER THE SOCKS.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.675
>> UNDER THE SOCKS?

24:35.708 --> 24:36.709
>> JEFF, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO US

24:36.743 --> 24:37.710
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.680
AND IF YOU DO,

24:40.713 --> 24:43.215
WE CAN USE WHAT YOU SAY
AGAINST YOU.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.551
AND IF YOU WANT A LAWYER,

24:44.584 --> 24:46.519
WE HAVE TO GET YOU ONE.
>> IT'S OKAY.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.689
I LIKE TALKING TO YOU.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.724
YOU'RE PRETTY.

24:51.758 --> 24:55.695
>> JEFF, DO YOU KNOW A MAN
NAMED DR. KEPPLER?

24:58.765 --> 25:00.767
>> NO.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.174
>> JEFF, IF YOU LIE TO US,

25:08.207 --> 25:11.310
WE HAVE TO PUNISH YOU.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.613
AND WE DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.287
YOU KNOW DR. KEPPLER?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.996
>> I WENT TO DR. KEPPLER
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

25:30.029 --> 25:31.731
BUT THEN I TOLD MOM
THAT I WANTED TO GO

25:31.764 --> 25:32.732
TO A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.100
>> HOW COME?

25:34.133 --> 25:35.835
>> BECAUSE WE LEARNED IN SCHOOL
THAT NOBODY IS SUPPOSED

25:35.868 --> 25:36.769
TO TOUCH YOU DOWN THERE.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.606
>> DID DR. KEPPLER TOUCH YOU
DOWN THERE?

25:39.639 --> 25:41.608
>> YEAH.

25:41.641 --> 25:42.909
HE RUBBED ME.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.678
AND HE SAID IT WAS OKAY
'CAUSE HE WAS A DOCTOR.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.014
AND THEN I SAW HIM GOING
TO JAIL ON TV,

25:48.047 --> 25:51.017
AND I WAS VERY ANGRY WITH HIM
'CAUSE HE TOLD ME A LIE.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.620
>> DID YOU GO SEE
DR. KEPPLER?

25:53.653 --> 25:54.821
>> I WENT TO HIS HOUSE

25:54.854 --> 25:56.055
AFTER WORK.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.323
AND I TOOK DAD'S GUN.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.758
I POINTED IT AT HIM,

25:58.791 --> 26:00.660
AND I ASKED HIM
WHY HE LIED TO ME.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.961
>> WHAT DID HE SAY?

26:01.994 --> 26:02.995
>> HE TRIED TO HIT ME

26:03.029 --> 26:05.064
WITH THE GOLF CLUB.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.633
BUT HE HIT THE GUN.

26:06.666 --> 26:10.737
AND A BULLET WENT
INTO HIS KNEE AND HE FELL DOWN.

26:10.770 --> 26:14.607
AND THEN...

26:14.641 --> 26:17.176
HE CALLED ME STUPID.

26:17.209 --> 26:21.147
AND THAT IS A BAD NAME
THAT THE BULLIES CALL ME,

26:21.180 --> 26:23.115
SO I GOT ANGRY AGAIN.

26:23.149 --> 26:27.253
AND I SHOT AND SHOT
AND SHOT,

26:27.286 --> 26:28.821
BUT NONE OF THE BULLETS HIT HIM.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.824
AND HE CALLED ME
AN IDIOT.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.661
BUT THERE WERE
NO MORE BULLETS LEFT.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.763
SO I HIT HIM
WITH DAD'S GUN

26:36.796 --> 26:40.900
AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN.

26:40.933 --> 26:45.271
BUT THEN THE GUN GOT ALL RED
AND--AND SLIPPERY.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.207
SO I HIT HIM
WITH THE GOLF CLUB.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.143
AND THEN HE DIDN'T CALL ME NAMES
ANYMORE.

26:55.114 --> 26:59.051
JEFFREY, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID
TO DR. KEPPLER WAS WRONG.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.754
DAD SAYS IF A BULLY HURTS ME,
I GOTTA FIGHT BACK

27:01.788 --> 27:05.057
AND KILL THE BASTARD.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.894
>> ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED
THAT HE'S SLOW?

27:07.927 --> 27:09.929
>> THAT'S THE DEFENSE'S PROBLEM.
NOT MINE.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.898
ARREST HIM.

27:13.833 --> 27:17.670
LIONEL GRANGER? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:17.704 --> 27:18.537
>> JEFFREY'S BOSS CALLED
AND SAID

27:18.570 --> 27:19.972
THAT YOU PICKED JEFFREY UP
FROM WORK.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.173
SO I CALLED MR. GRANGER.

27:21.207 --> 27:24.877
>> MR. GRANGER REPRESENTED
YOUR SON'S ABUSER, MRS. LYNWOOD.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.446
HE KNOWS FULL WELL
DEFENDING YOUR SON

27:27.479 --> 27:28.447
IS A WHOPPING CONFLICT
OF INTEREST.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.916
>> NOT WHEN THE ABUSER'S DEAD,

27:29.949 --> 27:31.250
AND I HAVE A WAIVER
FROM HIS ESTATE, ALEX.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.819
>> DID SHE HIRE YOU

27:32.852 --> 27:33.619
BECAUSE YOU KNOW KEPPLER'S
FILTHY LITTLE SECRETS?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.988
>> WHO BETTER TO REPRESENT
HER SON?

27:37.423 --> 27:38.925
>> JEFFREY.

27:38.958 --> 27:39.992
>> MOMMY, PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.761
>> OH, SWEETIE,
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.062
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.731
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
>> THE TRUTH.

27:44.764 --> 27:45.732
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS SAY.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.000
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.769
>> YOUR SON IS 19,
MRS. LYNWOOD.

27:49.802 --> 27:50.837
THE LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE US TO.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.105
>> WE'RE ARRESTING HIM
FOR SECOND DEGREE MURDER.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.874
>> YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.009
>> PLEASE, HE'S AN ABUSE VICTIM.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.845
ALEX, TALK TO HIM YOURSELF.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.013
YOU'LL SEE, HE'S SUFFERING
FROM RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.916
>> IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, THEN LET
OUR SHRINK INTERVIEW HIM.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.384
>> FINE.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.888
>> JEFF, DO YOU HAVE
ANY TROUBLE SLEEPING?

28:08.921 --> 28:12.992
>> GET IN TROUBLE
WHEN I'M SLEEPING?

28:13.025 --> 28:15.161
THAT'S SILLY.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.798
>> HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY
NIGHTMARES ABOUT DR. KEPPLER?

28:18.831 --> 28:21.000
>> SOMETIMES.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.735
HE LOOKS LIKE A MONSTER.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.805
HE'S VERY SCARY.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.977
>> CAN YOU READ THIS?

28:34.981 --> 28:36.983
>> UH-OH.
>> WHAT IS IT?

28:37.016 --> 28:38.484
>> ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
>> YES, I AM.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.886
>> WHERE'S MY MOM?
I WANNA GO NOW.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.789
>> JEFFREY, YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW--
>> LET ME OUT.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.823
>> NO, I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

28:43.856 --> 28:44.857
>> GET OUT OF MY WAY.
>> OH!

28:46.025 --> 28:47.059
>> YOU'RE A BAD MAN.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.996
YOU'RE A BAD MAN!
STOP IT!

28:50.029 --> 28:53.399
STOP IT! STOP IT!
DOCTORS ARE BAD.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.467
DOCTORS ARE BAD.
DOCTORS ARE BAD.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.037
GET OFF ME.
GET OFF ME.

29:02.875 --> 29:03.843
>> I DIDN'T BLACK OUT.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.177
MY HEAD DOESN'T HURT.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.478
I DON'T FEEL NAUSEOUS
OR DIZZY.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.047
I DON'T NEED
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.316
>> THEN YOU GOTTA SIGN
YOU'RE REFUSING TRANSPORT, DOC.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.351
>> CHIEF OF D'S GONNA WANT
MY INCIDENT REPORT

29:12.384 --> 29:13.886
ON HIS DESK FIRST THING.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.388
>> THEN GO FILL IT OUT.
I'M OKAY.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.194
>> ARE YOU SURE?

29:22.228 --> 29:26.833
>> ABOUT ME, YES,
BUT NOT ABOUT JEFFREY.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.567
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
REALLY WRONG WITH HIM.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.336
>> SOMETHING LIKE WHAT?

29:30.369 --> 29:31.470
>> A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.939
HE ACTS LIKE A CHILD.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.041
HE CAN'T PROCESS
A SIMPLE SENTENCE.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.976
>> HE HAS A JOB.
HE CAN READ.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.310
HE TAKES CARE OF HIMSELF.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.947
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE JEFF
ARE HIGH FUNCTIONING.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.015
>> MOST OF THEM
DON'T COMMIT MURDER.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.183
HE ALMOST KILLED YOU.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.918
>> BECAUSE HE CAN'T CONTROL
HIS TEMPER

29:45.952 --> 29:48.020
OR HIS EMOTIONS.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.088
>> HE'S STILL
MENTALLY COMPETENT.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.823
HE MADE A PLAN.
HE GOT DADDY'S GUN.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.558
HE LOADED IT, AND HE SHOVED IT
IN KEPPLER'S FACE.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.126
>> TO MAKE KEPPLER TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.227
>> HE SHOT HIM,

29:55.261 --> 29:57.263
AND HE BASHED
HIS BRAINS IN.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.098
>> BECAUSE KEPPLER WAS CALLING
HIM NAMES.

29:59.131 --> 30:03.469
HE'S AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD
IN A MAN'S BODY.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.138
HIS IQ IS PROBABLY
RIGHT ON THE BORDERLINE.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.306
>> CAN YOU DEFINITIVELY SAY
THAT I CANNOT TRY HIM

30:07.339 --> 30:09.141
BECAUSE HE'S RETARDED?

30:09.175 --> 30:12.244
>> NO.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.887
>> JEFFREY, WHEN DETECTIVES
BENSON AND STABLER BROUGHT YOU

30:20.920 --> 30:23.089
TO THE POLICE STATION,
WERE THEY NICE TO YOU?

30:23.122 --> 30:25.291
>> NO, THEY WERE MEAN.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.160
>> HOW WERE THEY MEAN?

30:28.194 --> 30:30.429
>> THEY SAID IF I LIED,
THEY WERE GOING TO PUNISH ME,

30:30.462 --> 30:32.164
AND THE MAN TOUCHED ME.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.000
>> WHERE DID DETECTIVE STABLER
TOUCH YOU?

30:34.033 --> 30:36.502
>> ON MY SHOULDER.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.170
I GOT SCARED.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.238
>> IS THAT WHY YOU TOLD
THE DETECTIVES

30:39.271 --> 30:40.940
YOU KILLED DR. KEPPLER?

30:40.973 --> 30:43.075
>> YEAH.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.477
>> NOTHING FURTHER.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.347
>> DO YOU KNOW A BOY
NAMED CHAD SMITH?

30:48.380 --> 30:51.350
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT HIM.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.119
>> WHY NOT, JEFF?

30:53.152 --> 30:55.955
>> 'CAUSE HE'S A BULLY.
>> DID YOU BEAT HIM UP?

30:55.988 --> 30:58.057
>> SOMEBODY TELL ME
HOW THIS IS RELEVANT.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.259
>> GOES TO THE DEFENDANT'S
CREDIBILITY, YOUR HONOR.

31:00.292 --> 31:03.595
>> I'LL ALLOW IT.
ANSWER THE QUESTION, YOUNG MAN.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.131
DID YOU BEAT THIS BOY UP?

31:08.700 --> 31:11.137
>> YEAH.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.139
>> IN FACT, YOU BROKE HIS NOSE
AND TWO OF HIS RIBS

31:13.172 --> 31:14.140
WHEN HE CALLED YOU A MORON.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.007
>> DON'T SAY THAT.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.042
>> AND WHEN YOUR PRINCIPAL
ASKED YOU

31:16.075 --> 31:18.444
WHY YOU HIT CHAD,
YOU SAID CHAD HIT YOU FIRST.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.445
IS THAT CORRECT?

31:19.478 --> 31:21.213
>> WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO MEAN?

31:21.247 --> 31:22.548
>> BECAUSE YOU LIED,
JEFFREY,

31:22.581 --> 31:23.582
SO THAT YOU WOULDN'T GET
INTO TROUBLE.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.217
IT'S THE SAME REASON

31:25.251 --> 31:27.153
THAT YOU LIED ABOUT THE POLICE
FORCING YOU TO CONFESS

31:27.186 --> 31:28.687
TO KILLING DR. KEPPLER.
>> STOP YELLING AT ME!

31:28.720 --> 31:31.958
I AM NOT A LIAR.
>> YOUR HONOR!

31:31.991 --> 31:33.359
>> WE'RE IN RECESS.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.162
COUNSEL IN MY CHAMBERS
RIGHT NOW.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.163
[pounds gavel]

31:44.103 --> 31:47.139
>> I WANT HER BROUGHT BEFORE
THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

31:47.173 --> 31:48.207
FOR BADGERING JEFFREY.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.175
MY CLIENTS ARE FURIOUS.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.243
>> CLIENTS? JEFFREY LYNWOOD
IS YOUR CLIENT.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.244
NOT HIS PARENTS.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.246
I'M MOVING TO DISQUALIFY
MR. GRANGER AS COUNSEL.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.982
>> OH, SHE'S POSTURING.
>> YOU'RE A SLEAZEBAG.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.449
YOU'RE LETTING JEFFREY'S FATHER
CALL THE SHOTS

31:57.483 --> 32:00.152
BECAUSE HE CAN PAY YOU
AND JEFFREY CAN'T.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.954
>> I'M ACTING
IN MY CLIENT'S BEST INTERESTS.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.222
>> YOUR CLIENT HAS
AS MUCH BUSINESS

32:03.255 --> 32:05.357
ON A WITNESS STAND
AS I DO RIDING IN A RODEO.

32:05.391 --> 32:09.228
ONLY A HORSE'S ASS WOULD IGNORE
HIS DIMINISHED MENTAL CAPACITY.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.696
>> YOU'RE OUT OF LINE,
YOUR HONOR.

32:10.729 --> 32:13.732
>> AND YOU ARE A DISGRACE
TO THE DEFENSE BAR, MR. GRANGER.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.169
AND IF YOU DON'T GET
YOUR ACT IN LINE,

32:17.203 --> 32:19.171
I'LL GRANT HER MOTION
AND REPORT YOU

32:19.205 --> 32:20.272
TO THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.308
NOW GET OUT.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.279
NOT YOU, ALEX.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.581
YOU'RE NOT BLAMELESS
IN THIS.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.749
>> THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
THE BURDEN TO PROVE

32:30.782 --> 32:32.651
THE DEFENDANT INCOMPETENT
TO STAND TRIAL.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.653
>> NO, YOU HAVE
A BIGGER BURDEN.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.188
TO SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE.

32:36.222 --> 32:39.558
>> I AM.
JEFFREY LYNWOOD KILLED A MAN.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.128
>> JEFFREY LYNWOOD HAS THE MIND
OF A CHILD.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.762
HE CAN'T STAND UP
FOR HIMSELF.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.399
VIOLATING HIS RIGHTS
ISN'T JUSTICE.

32:47.433 --> 32:48.700
>> YOUR HONOR,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

32:48.734 --> 32:50.702
WE AREN'T IN YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW CLASS ANYMORE.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.038
THIS IS THE REAL WORLD.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.508
>> I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN
MORE OF THE REAL WORLD

32:56.542 --> 32:57.509
THAN ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO.

32:57.543 --> 33:00.579
IT TOOK GUTS TO COME BACK.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.580
AND I'M GLAD YOU DID.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.516
BUT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO FORGET

33:04.550 --> 33:08.254
WHY YOU BECAME AN ADA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

33:08.287 --> 33:12.191
THE ALEXANDRA CABOT
I REMEMBER...

33:12.224 --> 33:16.195
WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER
RAILROADING THIS POOR YOUNG MAN.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.469
>> YOU WERE RIGHT.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.405
I WAS OUT FOR BLOOD.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.240
>> AND I WAS ABOUT TO CALL YOU.

33:28.274 --> 33:30.576
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S REALLY
WRONG WITH JEFFREY.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.345
>> WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
INCOMPETENT IS INCOMPETENT.

33:33.379 --> 33:36.282
>> THE TRAGEDY IS,
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.217
>> HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

33:38.250 --> 33:41.153
>> WE NEED TO TALK
TO HIS MOTHER.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.056
>> I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

33:44.090 --> 33:48.360
>> MRS. LYNWOOD...
PLEASE.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.269
WHEN JEFFREY WAS A BABY,

33:57.303 --> 33:59.071
DID HE HIT ALL
HIS DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES?

33:59.105 --> 34:02.541
>> YEAH, HE WAS FINE
UNTIL HE WAS FIVE.

34:02.574 --> 34:03.675
>> AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

34:03.709 --> 34:04.776
>> HE HAD A SEIZURE.

34:04.810 --> 34:09.548
AND HIS BRAIN SWELLED.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.617
AND WE THOUGHT
HE WAS GONNA DIE.

34:14.486 --> 34:17.289
WHEN HE FINALLY RECOVERED,
HE JUST...

34:17.323 --> 34:20.392
HE WASN'T THE SAME.

34:20.426 --> 34:23.462
DR. KEPPLER SAID THAT IT WAS
A MIRACLE THAT HE SURVIVED.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.364
>> DID HE KNOW
WHAT CAUSED THE SEIZURE?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.699
>> MM-HMM.
HE SAID IT WAS EPILEPSY.

34:27.733 --> 34:31.203
>> DR. KEPPLER MISSED
JEFFREY'S PICA.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.639
>> WHAT IS PICA?

34:33.672 --> 34:34.640
>> IT'S A RARE NEUROLOGICAL
DISORDER

34:34.673 --> 34:36.642
IN WHICH A PERSON EATS OBJECTS
OTHER THAN FOOD,

34:36.675 --> 34:38.244
LIKE WHEN JEFFREY WAS CHEWING
ON THE PENCIL

34:38.277 --> 34:40.379
IN COURT.

34:40.412 --> 34:41.780
>> THAT'S WHY
WE COULDN'T MAKE HIM

34:41.813 --> 34:43.115
STOP PUTTING THINGS
IN HIS MOUTH.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.816
>> WHAT KINDS OF THINGS?

34:44.850 --> 34:46.352
>> WHATEVER HE COULD GET
HIS HANDS ON.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.288
>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU KEPT SOMETHING?

34:51.290 --> 34:52.258
>> YES.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.227
HIS LITTLE TOY CARS.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.297
MY HUSBAND CAME HOME
FROM WORK ONE NIGHT

34:58.330 --> 35:00.266
WITH DOZENS OF THEM.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.600
>> AND TWO DAYS LATER,

35:01.633 --> 35:04.436
JEFFREY'D LICKED THE PAINT
OFF EVERY ONE OF THEM.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.539
SAID THEY TASTED
LIKE SWEET AND SOUR CANDY.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.841
>> VIRGINIA.
DID YOU LET THEM IN HERE?

35:09.875 --> 35:11.777
>> YES, THEY'RE HERE
TO HELP JEFFREY.

35:11.810 --> 35:12.878
>> NO, THEY'RE NOT.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.746
THEY'RE HERE
TO SLAP A LABEL ON HIM.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.715
>> WE KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR SON.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.384
>> SO DO I.
HE'S A LITTLE SLOW.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.751
>> WAKE UP, CLIVE.

35:19.785 --> 35:24.790
JEFFREY'S DEVELOPMENTALLY
DELAYED.

35:24.823 --> 35:25.891
HE'S NEVER GONNA BE
THE PERFECT CHILD

35:25.924 --> 35:30.496
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.672
>> HE WAS PERFECTLY FINE
WHEN HE WAS A BABY.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.809
>> HE WASN'T BORN
THIS WAY.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.411
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.349
AFTER SEEING JEFF EAT THE PENCIL
IN COURT YESTERDAY,

35:50.382 --> 35:52.384
I ORDERED AN MRI OF HIS BRAIN.

35:52.418 --> 35:55.354
THESE RED SPOTS INDICATE AREAS
OF MISSING GRAY MATTER.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.224
>> MISSING?
HOW?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.459
>> CHRONIC LEAD POISONING
PREVENTED JEFF'S BRAIN CELLS

36:00.492 --> 36:01.460
FROM GROWING.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.795
>> LEAD POISONING?

36:03.829 --> 36:05.197
ARE YOU SURE?

36:05.231 --> 36:06.465
>> MOST KIDS GET IT
FROM BREATHING DUST

36:06.498 --> 36:07.799
FROM DECAYING LEAD PAINT.

36:07.833 --> 36:11.503
BUT KIDS WITH PICA
ARE ALSO AT HIGH RISK.

36:11.537 --> 36:14.406
LEAD BUILDUP IN JEFF'S BODY
PROBABLY CAUSED HIS SEIZURE.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.907
>> AND STUDIES LINK
LEAD POISONING IN KIDS

36:15.941 --> 36:18.210
TO VIOLENT BEHAVIOR
WHEN THEY BECOME ADULTS.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.579
>> ARE YOU SAYING THIS EXCUSES
WHAT JEFFREY DID?

36:20.612 --> 36:22.648
>> JEFF'S ANTERIOR CINGULATE
CORTEX,

36:22.681 --> 36:24.950
THE EMOTION AND DECISION-MAKING
CENTER OF THE BRAIN,

36:24.983 --> 36:26.252
IS BADLY DAMAGED.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.854
WITH THE RIGHT PROVOCATION,

36:28.887 --> 36:30.389
THAT'S LIKE TAKING THE MUZZLE
OFF A RABID DOG.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.991
>> IT EXPLAINS WHY HE REACTED
SO VIOLENTLY

36:33.024 --> 36:34.460
WHEN DR. KEPPLER CALLED HIM
NAMES.

36:34.493 --> 36:38.797
>> KEPPLER NEVER TESTED JEFFREY
FOR LEAD

36:38.830 --> 36:40.499
BEFORE OR AFTER THE SEIZURE,
DID HE?

36:40.532 --> 36:44.002
>> NO.
>> HE NEVER EVEN MENTIONED IT.

36:44.035 --> 36:49.841
SO THAT BASTARD VICTIMIZED
MY SON TWICE.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.615
>> HI, MOM.
HI, DAD.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.750
>> HI.
HOW YOU DOING, KIDDO?

36:58.784 --> 37:01.219
>> I DON'T LIKE IT HERE.
THE PEOPLE AREN'T NICE.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.857
WHY ARE YOU CRYING, DADDY?

37:17.503 --> 37:18.970
>> BECAUSE I DIDN'T HELP YOU
ENOUGH,

37:19.004 --> 37:21.840
AND I'M SO SORRY.

37:21.873 --> 37:25.444
I'M SO SORRY.

37:27.546 --> 37:30.416
>> IT'S OKAY, DAD.

37:30.449 --> 37:31.650
I DID A BAD THING.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.593
>> SO I GUESS THIS MEANS
WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO TRIAL.

37:41.627 --> 37:44.296
>> OH, YES, WE ARE.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.500
SIR, COULD YOU PLEASE STATE
YOUR NAME, POSITION,

37:48.534 --> 37:50.536
AND WHY YOU'RE HERE
FOR THE RECORD.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.305
>> MICHAEL ROWAN, PRESIDENT
AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

37:53.339 --> 37:54.573
OF ROWAN TOYS INCORPORATED.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.941
YOU ASKED ME TO APPEAR

37:55.974 --> 37:57.208
AS AN EXPERT WITNESS
ON OUR PRODUCTS.

37:57.242 --> 38:00.479
>> THE DEFENSE STIPULATES TO THE
WITNESS'S EXPERTISE, YOUR HONOR.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.348
>> THE PEOPLE'S THREE
AND FOUR, YOUR HONOR.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.316
MR. ROWAN,
WHAT ARE THESE?

38:04.350 --> 38:05.584
>> OUR MINI ICE CREAM TRUCK.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.653
STILL A BIG SELLER.

38:07.686 --> 38:08.987
PAINT'S MISSING ON THAT ONE.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.456
>> THAT'S BECAUSE
JEFFREY LYNWOOD CHEWED IT OFF,

38:10.489 --> 38:12.791
WHICH THE DEFENSE CLAIMS
GAVE HIM LEAD POISONING.

38:12.824 --> 38:13.725
>> THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.461
LEAD-BASED PAINT HAS BEEN BANNED
FROM TOYS

38:15.494 --> 38:17.629
IN THIS COUNTRY
SINCE 1978.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.465
WE HAVEN'T USED IT SINCE.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.499
>> WHAT ABOUT ON THE TOYS
YOU MAKE OVERSEAS?

38:20.532 --> 38:21.767
>> OF COURSE NOT.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.068
WE SPOT-CHECK
OUR MANUFACTURERS' SHIPMENTS

38:23.101 --> 38:25.671
AS DOES THE CONSUMER PRODUCT
SAFETY COMMISSION.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.540
>> THEN WHY DID
THE NYPD'S CRIME LABORATORY

38:28.574 --> 38:29.975
FIND THAT THE PAINT
ON THESE TOYS

38:30.008 --> 38:32.010
CONTAINED OVER 50% LEAD?

38:36.482 --> 38:39.585
>> YOU BROUGHT ME HERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

38:39.618 --> 38:40.386
YOU LIED TO ME.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.588
>> YOU LIED
TO THE WHOLE WORLD.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.855
THESE E-MAILS
BETWEEN YOU

38:43.889 --> 38:46.558
AND YOUR CHINESE MANUFACTURER
PROVE

38:46.592 --> 38:49.461
THAT YOU KNOWINGLY POISONED
CHILDREN OVER DECADES.

38:49.495 --> 38:53.064
>> I'M DONE
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.533
DEFENSE IN ON YOUR LITTLE SETUP
TOO?

38:54.566 --> 38:56.001
>> SIT DOWN, SIR.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.168
>> NO, YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER,
JUDGE,

38:57.202 --> 38:59.471
YOU AND YOUR CORRUPT D.A.,
AND YOUR JOKE OF A COURT.

38:59.505 --> 39:00.539
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET
AWAY WITH THIS...

39:00.572 --> 39:01.640
>> THAT'S ENOUGH.
[pounds gavel]

39:01.673 --> 39:02.941
OFFICERS, REMOVE THIS WITNESS
FROM THE COURTROOM.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.376
>> I CAN WALK
ON MY OWN.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.512
>> WE GOT IT.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.480
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
>> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

39:08.514 --> 39:12.451
>> POLICE. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.589
>> I'LL HAVE YOUR ASS
FOR THIS.

39:17.623 --> 39:18.924
>> I ALREADY HAVE YOURS,

39:18.957 --> 39:23.028
AND IT'S ON THE RECORD.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.229
>> JEFFREY ALLEN LYNWOOD,

39:24.262 --> 39:28.500
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
BEFORE I DELIVER MY VERDICT?

39:28.534 --> 39:31.403
>> I'M SORRY, SIR.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.604
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYONE.

39:32.638 --> 39:34.706
>> THEN ON THE SOLE COUNT
OF MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

39:34.740 --> 39:38.910
I FIND YOU NOT GUILTY
BY REASON OF MENTAL DEFECT.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.713
AS PER THE PLEA AGREEMENT
WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY,

39:41.747 --> 39:44.483
YOU WILL SURRENDER YOURSELF

39:44.516 --> 39:46.084
TO THE COMMISSIONER
OF HEALTH

39:46.117 --> 39:49.054
FOR HOSPITALIZATION
UNTIL IT IS DETERMINED

39:49.087 --> 39:52.157
THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER A THREAT
TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.526
WE'RE ADJOURNED.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.465
>> BYE, MOM.
BYE, DAD.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.533
>> WE'LL BE UP TO VISIT SOON.

40:01.567 --> 40:04.570
OKAY?

40:06.838 --> 40:08.674
>> HOW LONG WILL JEFF HAVE TO BE
IN THE HOSPITAL?

40:08.707 --> 40:09.575
>> THE JUDGE HAS PROMISED
TO REVIEW HIS PROGRESS

40:09.608 --> 40:10.909
IN A MONTH.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.811
>> AND HE CAN LIVE WITH US
AFTER HE'S RELEASED?

40:12.844 --> 40:14.112
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.581
ROWAN TOYS HAS AGREED
TO SUPPORT

40:15.614 --> 40:17.148
JEFF FINANCIALLY
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.685
THE AGREEMENT IS BINDING,
AND THEY CAN'T BACK OUT.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.887
>> THANK YOU.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.594
>> AH, COME ON.
VOLUNTARILY PLEDGED?

40:28.627 --> 40:30.562
>> AFTER THE FEDS RECALLED
HIS TOYS,

40:30.596 --> 40:32.964
ROWAN OFFERED ME THE DEAL
SO I WOULDN'T CHARGE HIM.

40:32.998 --> 40:36.702
ONCE HE SIGNED,
I TOLD HIM TO SHOVE IT.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.737
>> YOU REALLY ARE BACK,
AREN'T YA?
