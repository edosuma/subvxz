00:00.910 --> 00:02.640
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.660 --> 00:04.019
Listen,there's going
to be a visitor in the house.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.000
It's a french lady.

00:05.020 --> 00:08.720
She's writing this big book
about the 10th anniversary of 9/11.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.070
She's been to a couple of houses,
but she wants to talk to you guys.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.230
Anybody want to volunteer to be a sponsor?

00:13.250 --> 00:16.900
Might do you some good to think about
somebody else other than yourself for a change.

00:17.690 --> 00:18.930
No.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.730
He needs to know.

00:20.750 --> 00:21.800
No,he doesn'T.

00:21.820 --> 00:25.660
We're sleeping together,
but we're not,you know...

00:25.680 --> 00:26.990
Tommy's going to kill you anyway.

00:27.010 --> 00:29.820
If you're just seeing her,you might
as well get a little piece before you go.

00:29.840 --> 00:30.860
Tommy?

00:30.880 --> 00:32.420
This is dwight.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.020
How are you?

00:34.040 --> 00:34.980
Good.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.880
Doesn't even get up to greet me,
sticks his hand in the air.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.860
Like I'm supposed
to cross the room and greet him.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.050
Oh,there's pops.

00:41.070 --> 00:42.870
-He was a good man.
-The best.

00:42.890 --> 00:49.330
I'm watching a bunch of assholes get teary-eyed
about maybe the biggest asshole in the history of assholes.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.610
Who gives away their inheritance?

00:51.630 --> 00:53.040
-Assholes.
-Shitheads.

00:53.060 --> 00:54.610
What am I going to do with the money?

00:54.630 --> 00:58.010
What if we get a place like this?

00:58.030 --> 00:59.760
-You mean a bar?
-A bar!

00:59.780 --> 01:02.210
I bought the booze.
I went in the liquor store.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.680
I made a scene at that church.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.400
I take responsibility for my own actions.

01:06.420 --> 01:08.570
But it is kind of your fault.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.570
That section eight review...

01:10.590 --> 01:11.410
Yeah?

01:11.430 --> 01:13.150
Set for tuesday.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.600
3:00.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.790
Try not to be late.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.310
Did you find the place ok?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.710
Yeah.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.200
What's going on?

01:40.220 --> 01:42.290
Not much.

01:42.940 --> 01:45.080
What's that?

01:45.850 --> 01:47.220
-Bushmills.
-Really?

01:47.240 --> 01:51.990
So they make a non-alcoholic
version of bushmills now,is that right?

01:52.320 --> 01:55.200
That drink has been
sitting there untouched for how long?

01:55.220 --> 01:56.680
Uh,42 minutes and change.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.890
I asked him to time it.

01:59.610 --> 02:03.840
It's been sitting untouched because
I wanted to wait until you got here.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.100
Really?

02:06.290 --> 02:10.270
I want you to share in
my moment of celebration--my freedom.

02:11.140 --> 02:14.470
That little slip,you know,that mess
at the church a couple of days ago?

02:14.490 --> 02:15.880
It was bound to happen.

02:15.900 --> 02:22.240
All the years of not drinking,stress build-up,
anxiety--i ain't been going to meetings,either.

02:22.260 --> 02:24.310
I was bound to blow.

02:24.330 --> 02:29.620
So what I'm going
to do is,I'm going to drink...

02:30.190 --> 02:31.900
-but I'm going to control it.
-Let's go.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.890
As a matter of fact,you know what?

02:33.910 --> 02:35.360
Set one up.You're going
to have a drink with me.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.300
No,I'm not.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.850
As your sponsor,
I'm demanding you take a drink with me.

02:39.870 --> 02:41.890
-No.
-One sip.One drink.

02:41.910 --> 02:47.080
Or,so help me god,I will sit here,
i will get shitfaced,and it will be on your head.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.940
All right,tony.Take one sip of this.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.440
You're telling me you're going
to get off that barstool and leave with me.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.060
That's the deal.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.380
You don't even have to swallow it.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.710
Just get it to your lips.

02:57.730 --> 02:59.830
Let it evaporate,for all I care.

02:59.850 --> 03:01.960
Ok.Here I go.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.690
You can control it,tommy.
I can control it.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.940
You got to believe that.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.070
Ok.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.510
What the hell do you think
you're doing,picking up a drink?

03:12.530 --> 03:13.800
You told me to take a sip!

03:13.820 --> 03:15.740
Yeah,and if I told you to
jump off the brooklyn bridge,would you?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.780
-No,I wouldn't,but you--
-You think you got your problem under control--

03:17.800 --> 03:19.480
-I have my problem under--
-You're kidding yourself.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.000
Did you see how quick
he was to take that drink?

03:21.020 --> 03:22.410
Put that booze to his mouth,huh?

03:22.430 --> 03:24.530
-He negotiated for at least a couple of minutes.
-Negotiated what?

03:24.550 --> 03:27.730
-A sip!
-You got to renew your commitment to sobriety.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.740
You know what?This is unbelievable.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.400
-This is the--
-Hey,I slipped,ok?

03:31.420 --> 03:32.350
I admit it,ok?

03:32.370 --> 03:33.870
I made a mistake,but I'm moving forward.

03:33.890 --> 03:36.860
I'm not going to have a drink for the rest
of my life,a day at a time,but you,my friend,

03:36.880 --> 03:40.850
i am not going to let you use my moment of
weakness as an excuse for you to go off the wagon.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.700
-This is unbelievable.
-That's what this was about.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.730
Oh,that's what this was about?

03:44.750 --> 03:46.400
-So come on.
-This is the same asshole,by the way--

03:46.420 --> 03:47.190
Let's go to a meeting.

03:47.210 --> 03:50.220
He was flinging the host around in the church
the other day like they were goddamn frisbees.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.930
-This is--
-What was that for?

03:51.950 --> 03:52.960
Nothing.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.960
Just felt so good the first time.

Yeah.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.200
Just waiting for tommy.

04:51.220 --> 04:52.920
Got to talk to him.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.080
About banging his daughter?

04:54.100 --> 04:56.180
What the hell!Who told you?

04:56.200 --> 04:57.330
Lou.

04:57.350 --> 04:58.750
Lou's banging her,too?

04:58.770 --> 05:00.950
This is some bullshit.
Can't believe he told you.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.560
This is supposed to be top secret.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.120
I heard it from nils.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.930
Nils knows?

05:05.950 --> 05:07.310
About you and colleen?

05:07.330 --> 05:08.490
Keep it down!

05:08.510 --> 05:10.390
Get the hell out of here.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.360
-You guys are killing me.
-What are you so surprised about?

05:13.380 --> 05:15.720
People hear juicy gossip,
they're going to spread it around.

05:15.740 --> 05:16.980
This is a firehouse.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.300
Take away the rig,the gear,and testosterone
it's nothing but a goddamn sorority in here.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.700
All right.Listen.Just--

05:21.720 --> 05:23.480
just don't tell anybody else,all right?

05:23.500 --> 05:24.760
Tell anybody else what?

05:24.780 --> 05:26.110
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.790
No,no.Come on,guys.

05:27.810 --> 05:30.510
What-- What?

05:31.790 --> 05:32.830
Uh,7.

05:32.850 --> 05:33.830
7?

05:33.850 --> 05:34.550
Really?

05:34.570 --> 05:37.440
Years ago,in my teens.
My grandparents were over.I was bored.You know.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.400
How about you?

05:38.420 --> 05:39.930
4,also in my teens.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.240
But 7?Jesus.That's amazing.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.480
Thank you very much.

05:42.500 --> 05:47.130
Thomas,you're just in time for another in a long series
of gripping exchanges of deep thought and personal wisdom.

05:47.150 --> 05:48.120
What are we talking about?

05:48.140 --> 05:50.790
Today's topic is the most number
of times they masturbated in one day.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.700
Yeah.I'm 7.Sean's 4.Lou?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.030
-3
-Just 3?

05:54.050 --> 05:56.440
Well,it's only 8:30,
you know.The day's young.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.580
I'd go for 4,but food prep.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.760
Oh,yeah.But it takes
a little bit longer now,right?

06:00.780 --> 06:05.100
I mean,the older you get,don't you
need more time in between,you know...

06:05.120 --> 06:06.970
Ejaculations?

06:06.990 --> 06:11.420
Well,I mean,that's if you're getting
technical.I was going to say jizzes,but...

06:11.440 --> 06:13.100
That's funny.Jizzes.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.600
-Yeah.Jizzes.
-Jizzes.

06:14.620 --> 06:17.010
-Kind of tickles,right?
-I give up.

06:17.030 --> 06:18.290
I really give up.

06:18.310 --> 06:19.760
How about you,tommy?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.900
Oh,let me think.That would be...

06:21.920 --> 06:23.430
right.None of your business.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.340
Oh,come on.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.460
We did have a kid in
the old neighborhood,bobby morgan,

06:26.480 --> 06:29.510
claimed he jerked off
17 times in one 24-hour period.

06:29.530 --> 06:31.640
-No way.
-17 times?Is that even possible?

06:31.660 --> 06:34.490
Well,even more amazing
than that,it was a school day.

06:34.510 --> 06:36.080
Shit.17 times?

06:36.100 --> 06:39.220
He said the last time
pretty much just came out air.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.250
So his cock farted?

06:42.060 --> 06:45.000
I mean,come on.
It comes out air,hello,it's a fart.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.390
So it's a cock fart.

06:46.410 --> 06:49.390
You know,I've heard of
cock fights,but not cock farts.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.790
Hey,try saying that 10 times fast.

06:50.810 --> 07:00.160
Cock fight,cock fight...

07:00.550 --> 07:02.030
Everybody ok here?

07:02.050 --> 07:03.620
I wasn't--I wasn't doing anything.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.780
It's just the usual cock fart discussion,
chief.Ain't nothing wrong with it.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.280
Boy,am I glad I didn't bring her in here.
We'd have a lawsuit on our hands.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.440
Who?Bring who in?

07:10.460 --> 07:11.880
The french girl.She's here.

07:11.900 --> 07:13.610
The one that's
writing the book about 9/11.

07:13.630 --> 07:14.670
Aw,come on.

07:14.690 --> 07:18.770
You don't have to talk to her if you don't
want to,but she is a guest in our house.

07:18.790 --> 07:20.010
Guys,I did it.

07:20.030 --> 07:22.500
-what?
-You're not going to believe it,but I found it.I bought the bar.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.700
What--you bought it without us?

07:23.720 --> 07:25.510
We're supposed to be
doing this as a team,asshole.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.660
-You guys--
-I know,I know,I know.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.840
But it's the perfect place.It's down
in alphabet city.It's a sick location,guys.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.170
You got to come down after the shift.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.040
I got the goddamn floor,ok?

07:34.060 --> 07:36.340
Sorry,chief.It's just
that we're buying a bar together.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.030
I mean,it's my money,
but we're going to be running it together.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.670
Now we got to think of a name,guys.

07:39.690 --> 07:43.770
How about the shut the hell up
when I'm talking,asshole bar.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.230
Come on.On your feet.Let's go.Come on.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.590
Let's say bonjour
to the french girl.

07:48.610 --> 07:50.720
-You're dead,mike.
-The whole point was-- Wait till you see it!

07:50.740 --> 07:52.340
You were going to consult with us.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.630
Ah,there you are.

07:54.650 --> 07:56.760
Well,I thought you forgot all about me.

07:56.780 --> 08:01.060
Oh,no,I just had to tell these ass--pardon
my french,which is really an expression,

08:01.080 --> 08:02.780
because I don't speak french.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.280
Well,no sense standing on formality.
You all know why you're here.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.890
And this is silletti
and garrity and franco and lou.

08:08.910 --> 08:11.410
And this is genevieve lazard.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.190
Gen-ev-ieve.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.820
I'll call you genny,ok?

08:14.840 --> 08:16.450
Great.

08:17.190 --> 08:18.960
-and this gentleman?
-Tommy.

08:18.980 --> 08:19.900
Oh,forget about him.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.380
He's the resident section eight,which means
he's only going to be here a few more days.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.080
-Right,tom?
-Never know.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.770
Oh,I know,I know.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.040
So,welcome aboard.

08:28.060 --> 08:31.160
Everybody knows why
you're here,and we're all here for you.

08:31.180 --> 08:34.400
Well,thank you.I really appreciate it.

08:35.059 --> 08:37.010
-Engine.
-Except not right now.

08:37.030 --> 08:40.270
-Come on!
-Nice to meet you,genevieve.

08:40.289 --> 08:42.070
Oh,that was so good,la.

08:42.090 --> 08:44.860
-Impeccable.
-Merci.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.700
Garrity,you all right?

08:52.720 --> 08:54.840
Think I maybe hurt
my back when I went down the stairs.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.110
But then I realize,
it's been hurting for weeks.

08:57.130 --> 09:00.200
Woke up this morning,it's turned into,
like,pins and needles,and then,you know,

09:00.220 --> 09:02.600
now,it feels like
this kind of stabbing thing.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.920
You don't really care,do you?

09:03.940 --> 09:04.880
All right.Good talking to you.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.860
All right.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.800
Lot of car fires lately.

09:11.820 --> 09:14.460
When it rains,it pours.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.230
Strange.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.950
Life.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.250
Life.

09:20.270 --> 09:25.060
You know,there's stuff you do
in your life,situations that come up.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.430
You don't plan for things
to happen,but they just do.

09:28.450 --> 09:34.300
I don't know about you,but I'm the kind of person,
I own my own reality that which I'm involved,

09:34.320 --> 09:38.130
and,uh,I take full responsibility for that.

09:38.150 --> 09:40.530
Those things.

09:40.550 --> 09:45.270
And I respect people
around me because,you know,

09:45.290 --> 09:48.390
i feel like I got to
keep it real and be open and honest,

09:48.410 --> 09:54.070
because the situations,the events,
those things in my life,they deserve that.

09:54.090 --> 09:56.560
You know what I'm saying?

09:57.040 --> 09:58.540
No.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.540
Ok.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.160
That guy's got some problems,man.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.120
Just one.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.690
But it's a honey.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.860
Sheila,sheila.

10:21.590 --> 10:23.540
-How are you?
-Hi,sweetheart.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.540
Hi,how are you?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.120
Good,good.

10:26.140 --> 10:28.770
This is kaleena,everybody.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.880
Did I say that right?

10:30.900 --> 10:34.990
Keep having to think of
the word oven c-lean-er to remember it.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.940
Anyway,kaleena is my little sister.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.770
Not biologically,durr,'cause she's black,
but I was at my psychodramaturg's the other day,

10:42.790 --> 10:45.190
and-- That's the guy you talk to about me?

10:45.210 --> 10:46.230
You wish.

10:46.250 --> 10:50.120
I was actually obsessing about
damien quitting college and this and that,

10:50.140 --> 10:54.760
and he said that I got a lot of love
to give and that I should find an outlet for it.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.890
He said that?

10:55.910 --> 10:59.810
Well,what he actually said is that
I'm spending too much time in my own head.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.320
But what i heard is that I got a lot of love.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.970
And he suggested that
I do some community service.

11:04.990 --> 11:07.640
So here we are.Right,sis?

11:07.660 --> 11:08.970
Can we go?

11:08.990 --> 11:14.290
No,in a second.I wanted her to see
a real-life new york city firehouse and fireman.

11:14.310 --> 11:15.460
Big thrill,right?

11:15.480 --> 11:16.470
Is he the one you like?

11:16.490 --> 11:19.240
What?No.I don't like anybody here.
We're going to go now.Very late.

11:19.260 --> 11:20.890
Bye.

11:20.910 --> 11:23.510
Bye,easy-off.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.590
Don'T.

11:28.330 --> 11:34.760
What you're going to hear from me,you're not
going to hear from anybody else because my opinions--

11:35.010 --> 11:37.830
well,let's just say they're not popular.

11:37.850 --> 11:39.930
9/11?

11:39.950 --> 11:41.650
Inside job.Plain and simple.

11:41.670 --> 11:46.010
All you got to do is connect the dots,and I'm not
talking about the dots everyone's already heard about.

11:46.030 --> 11:50.350
I'm not talking about bush sitting
in that school reading a book about a goat

11:50.370 --> 11:53.410
to those kids for 7 1/2
minutes after he was told the news.

11:53.430 --> 11:55.260
Everybody knows that.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.900
I am talking about...

11:58.600 --> 12:01.110
a massive neo-conservative government effort.

12:01.130 --> 12:04.130
It's been in the works for over 20 years.

12:04.150 --> 12:07.690
You ever heard of pnac,
project for a new american century?

12:07.710 --> 12:09.310
Perhaps.

12:09.330 --> 12:13.280
Well,according to them,the end goal
of their effort is american global domination--

12:13.300 --> 12:15.050
full spectrum dominance they call it.

12:15.070 --> 12:19.210
Now,the first question that pops to my mind is,
how do you pull that off in this day and age?

12:19.230 --> 12:21.150
Well,according to them,you do it in 4 steps.

12:21.170 --> 12:25.810
First,we must control the world's oil,
especially the oil in central asia and the middle east.

12:25.830 --> 12:31.310
Now,I don't have to remind you that bush/cheney,they came
to power with plans already made to attack afghanistan and iraq.

12:31.330 --> 12:35.180
Number 2,we have to make huge technological
advances with our armed forces that,

12:35.200 --> 12:38.550
for some reason,include
the capability to fight wars from outer space.

12:38.570 --> 12:43.370
Number 3,surprise,surprise,huge increases
in military spending to pay for the above--

12:43.390 --> 12:45.590
$130 billion a year worth.

12:45.610 --> 12:49.190
Now,never mind the sick and
dying first responders,9/11's heroes,

12:49.210 --> 12:51.830
who can't even pay their light bill,
let alone their medical bills,

12:51.850 --> 12:53.850
and a lot of whom are
ending up homeless because of it.

12:53.870 --> 12:56.160
I guess there's just not enough
room in the budget for them.

12:56.180 --> 13:00.680
Number 4,and this is key,
we change the definition of preemptive attack

13:00.700 --> 13:04.250
so we can unilaterally bomb
the shit out of,invade,and occupy countries,

13:04.270 --> 13:08.150
even if they pose no credible
threat or had nothing to do with 9/11.

13:08.170 --> 13:10.690
One problem-- how are
you going to put it into action?

13:10.710 --> 13:13.600
I mean,the american people are never
going to go for no shit like that,right?

13:13.620 --> 13:14.990
You're damn straight.

13:15.010 --> 13:20.260
What you need is an event--an event that gets
everyone's heads turned around the right way.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.900
What you need is a new pearl harbor.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.510
That's what they said they needed.

13:24.530 --> 13:27.090
Now,you're looking at a guy
who went to 58 funerals in 26 days.

13:27.110 --> 13:30.560
I can tell you,
that is sure as shit what they got.

13:32.210 --> 13:35.160
Are you single?

13:38.240 --> 13:40.430
So,what do you think,boys?

13:40.450 --> 13:41.940
Pretty sweet,huh?

13:41.960 --> 13:43.430
It's a good space,right?

13:43.450 --> 13:46.230
And then,there's
even an office in the back.

13:46.250 --> 13:49.010
And there's a men's
room here and a girl's room.

13:49.030 --> 13:50.850
Both.

13:51.780 --> 13:54.060
Basement.Interesting.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.100
Well,the good news is,you know,
we don't have to bring in a bar.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.160
You ok?

13:58.180 --> 14:01.530
It used to actually be a place called,
um,whiskey villa,and before that,

14:01.550 --> 14:03.950
it was a place called the wagon train.

14:03.970 --> 14:05.430
It was jerry's before that.

14:05.450 --> 14:09.260
And then,it was a place
called toklas',which was a lesbo bar.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.500
And then,it was jerry's
before that,but a different jerry.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.980
I'm sorry.Go--you-- you bought a lesbo bar?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.180
What are you,crazy?

14:15.200 --> 14:16.950
It was a lesbo bar a long time ago.

14:16.970 --> 14:19.620
Well,mike,the whole reason we're doing this,
the whole reason we're buying this bar,

14:19.640 --> 14:21.350
is because of the pussy vibe.

14:21.370 --> 14:22.720
And to make money,dude.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.840
No,seano's right.
It's because of the pussy.

14:24.860 --> 14:27.560
Now you stuck us with a place
that possibly has the wrong pussy vibe.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.040
I-- Is there any
pussy vibe that's wrong?

14:30.060 --> 14:31.260
And you know what?

14:31.280 --> 14:35.870
The real estate guy said that,years ago,
this whole building was a gynecologist's office.

14:35.890 --> 14:38.340
Now I got to rethink the whole pussy vibe thing.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.810
So maybe it was a gynecologist's
office longer than it was a lesbo bar,

14:41.830 --> 14:45.960
which would then potentially allow
the good pussy vibe to,you know,

14:45.980 --> 14:47.030
counteract the bad.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.200
I've waited my whole life for this.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.690
We're actually having
a discussion about pussy feng shui.

14:50.710 --> 14:51.940
So,what are you going to do?

14:51.960 --> 14:54.130
How you going to pimp this
place out,in terms of the decor?

14:54.150 --> 14:56.500
I don't know.Why don't we just kind
of leave it a bombed-out shithole

14:56.520 --> 14:58.910
and call it the bombed-out shithole?

14:58.930 --> 15:01.930
I actually have some good ideas,but I'm going
to need some help from you guys,you know,

15:01.950 --> 15:05.530
to help me decorate it and stuff.

15:05.550 --> 15:07.170
I want to call it lumberjacks.

15:07.190 --> 15:09.420
Lumberjacks.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.050
You know,we could make all the
walls wood so it's like a log cabin.

15:14.070 --> 15:18.190
Then,we can put those old saws,
you know,the kind with 2 guys,and then,

15:18.210 --> 15:21.460
we could have snowshoes on the walls,
and then we can have those lamps

15:21.480 --> 15:26.100
that were made out of antlers.
And we could have a fake fireplace and a bear.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.670
What do you say,guys?

15:27.690 --> 15:30.110
Actually,I don't think it's a bad idea.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.480
-I'm in.
-All right.Let me get this straight.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.870
You guys don't want lesbians in here,
but you're going to go with the lumberjack theme.

15:35.890 --> 15:39.410
All right.Let's get to work,lads.
Uncle lou has a mighty terrible thirst.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.630
And with that,I bid you bums farewell.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.840
All right.Peace.

15:42.860 --> 15:43.670
Hot date,lou?

15:43.690 --> 15:47.950
You know I never
discuss female thermodynamics.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.920
I mean,that's right.I like that.

15:52.940 --> 15:54.430
Oh,hey,prick,how's it going?

15:54.450 --> 15:56.640
You still in the fdny,
or they kick your skinny ass out?

15:56.660 --> 15:59.190
You make me laugh so hard.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.100
Is that why you haven't
had your section eight hearing yet,huh?

16:01.120 --> 16:04.080
You know,are you just going to bust my balls?
'Cause I'll hang up right now.Here I go.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.330
No.Hey,listen.It's teddy.

16:06.350 --> 16:08.760
Ellie called.
Evidently,he's not doing too great.

16:08.780 --> 16:12.300
I guess he's been down,but things
have gotten worse over the last couple of days.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.670
Look,I'm done at work,so I thought maybe
we could swing by and cheer his ass up.

16:15.690 --> 16:18.360
I'm down at the bar on avenue c,
so come pick me up here.

16:18.380 --> 16:21.190
You--are you drinking?

16:22.300 --> 16:24.270
-I wish.
-What about if we put a moose head?

16:25.170 --> 16:27.420
So,you like it here,america?

16:27.440 --> 16:29.640
Is new york america?

16:29.660 --> 16:32.060
It reminds me a lot of paris.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.660
I've never been to paris.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.310
Down to business.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.550
-Do you mind?
-No,no.

16:39.570 --> 16:42.550
I just thought that maybe we'd,you know,
kind of get to know each other a little bit before we--

16:42.570 --> 16:47.050
You must have a lot of memories
from 9/11 and the days thereafter.

16:47.070 --> 16:50.710
Is there one that
stands out above the others?

16:51.870 --> 16:55.170
One memory...I don't know.

16:56.010 --> 17:04.089
In the-- in the days after,we were working
day and night trying to find somebody,anybody.

17:04.109 --> 17:07.920
After a while,reality settled in,
and you realize you weren't looking for somebody,

17:07.940 --> 17:15.619
you were looking
for some thing-- a head,an arm,torso.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.750
Tommy's cousin,
all we found was a finger.

17:18.770 --> 17:19.800
Tommy?

17:19.819 --> 17:21.119
The section eight guy?

17:21.140 --> 17:23.220
Oh,yes.

17:24.020 --> 17:27.310
When all you find
is a finger,you have to...

17:27.329 --> 17:29.600
there has to be respect.

17:29.620 --> 17:33.190
You can't just walk off
the pile with a finger on a stretcher.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.240
You don't want
the family seeing that,you know.

17:35.260 --> 17:41.430
So you put the finger on the stretcher,and then you
construct the body around it using whatever you have--

17:41.450 --> 17:44.430
helmets,gear,
you know,pieces of wood.

17:44.450 --> 17:47.010
And then,you...

17:47.030 --> 17:51.610
drape a flag over it,
and you're good to go.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.810
Since those days,I'm different.

17:55.830 --> 17:58.480
Everything...

17:59.320 --> 18:01.790
that I was going to feel for
the rest of my life,every emotion,

18:01.810 --> 18:07.590
every scrap of
fear or joy or hope,sadness,I...

18:07.920 --> 18:11.820
I used it all up at ground zero.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.190
That's all gone now.

18:16.210 --> 18:20.000
And I got nothing left to feel.

18:22.340 --> 18:25.720
I'm still alive,but...

18:27.160 --> 18:30.270
I got to look in the mirror a couple
of times a day just to make sure that

18:30.290 --> 18:36.700
I'm not made of helmets
or gear,some pieces of wood.

18:51.310 --> 18:53.380
Move your body.
Something wrong with your drink?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.390
Nah.It's fine.

18:55.410 --> 18:57.450
-How you boys doing tonight?
-Great.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.220
-We're ready to party.
-Excellent.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.580
Anybody looking for a special dance?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.880
How about you,stud?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.380
Not tonight,sweetheart.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.140
Aww,come on,you.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.650
I love your grey hair.

19:11.670 --> 19:13.510
I think it's sexy.

19:13.530 --> 19:15.580
Tell your story walking,sister.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.540
You aren't very nice.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.070
You're a party pooper.

19:19.090 --> 19:21.610
He's a party pooper,isn't he?

19:21.630 --> 19:23.520
Hey,I just lost my older brother.

19:23.540 --> 19:26.340
Greatest guy in the world.
Now,nothing makes sense to me.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.890
Amazing human being,and he dies.

19:28.910 --> 19:32.590
Me?Total useless piece
of shit?I get to go on breathing.

19:32.610 --> 19:34.450
How do you figure?

19:34.470 --> 19:38.130
It's a strip club,asshole.Lighten up.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.740
Come on,you know how you do,
how you do Hey,he was 82,ok?

19:42.760 --> 19:45.500
What are you,
putting time limits on people now?

19:45.520 --> 19:47.050
Shut your mouth.

19:47.070 --> 19:51.300
Just 'cause it's ok for you doesn't
mean it's goddamn ok for the rest of us.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.450
Who says it's ok for me?

19:52.470 --> 19:55.270
I seen you.I seen you at the funeral.

19:55.290 --> 20:01.130
I'm up there crying my guts out like a bitch,
and you're sitting there like a goddamn stone.

20:01.150 --> 20:05.120
And then,all that shit you said the other
night after we watched the movies?

20:05.140 --> 20:09.240
You make me sick just to look at you.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.510
You're glad he's gone.

20:14.530 --> 20:20.790
You're glad because now you don't have
to look at the kind of man you'll never be.

20:22.570 --> 20:25.960
Get me the hell out of here.

20:30.180 --> 20:32.670
Look,I,um...

20:32.690 --> 20:35.530
I just want to say
I'm sorry for what happened before.

20:35.550 --> 20:37.560
I don't usually end up
blubbering into my salad.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.220
Oh,it's ok.I understand.

20:39.240 --> 20:43.180
Usually,when I go out with a woman,
I try not to cry until the second date.

20:43.200 --> 20:48.030
And even then,it's usually
just a last-ditch effort to get sex.

20:49.920 --> 20:53.640
-Taxi.
-We should probably get going.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.620
See you soon.Thank you.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.320
Oh,2 for one.Thank you.

21:06.340 --> 21:07.430
Oh,your moustache.

21:07.450 --> 21:08.560
I'm sorry.

21:08.580 --> 21:09.810
They're dangerous.

21:09.830 --> 21:12.570
That's why I never get
involved with men with facial hair.

21:12.590 --> 21:13.930
I have the same rule.

21:13.950 --> 21:15.290
Bonsoir.

21:15.310 --> 21:17.330
Good night.

21:17.350 --> 21:20.710
See you.Safe home.

21:29.710 --> 21:30.790
You on tomorrow?

21:30.810 --> 21:32.830
No.I got to go help
the 3 stooges with the bar.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.670
And then,the afternoon,
I got that thing.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.140
Oh,that section eight bullshit?

21:36.160 --> 21:38.660
Feinberg can't wait,
that dirty prick.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.870
You know he already got some guy
picked out to take your place on the crew?

21:40.890 --> 21:42.950
So I hear.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.090
We're going to miss you.

21:44.110 --> 21:45.700
Oh,thanks for the vote of confidence.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.930
I'm a realist.

21:46.950 --> 21:47.890
-That's nice.
-Hey,lou.

21:47.910 --> 21:49.760
-Hey,guys.
-Hey,what you got?

21:49.780 --> 21:52.900
Uh,a broken car antenna.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.650
Cool.

21:54.670 --> 21:57.000
-See you.
-Night.

21:57.580 --> 22:00.350
He look different to you?

22:00.370 --> 22:02.210
New shirt?

22:02.230 --> 22:04.160
I'm not going to answer that,
on account of if I'm right,

22:04.180 --> 22:06.620
I'm spending way
too much time looking at lou.

22:07.220 --> 22:08.520
-What's going on?
-Hey,chief.How are you?

22:08.540 --> 22:10.380
Good to see you.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.220
Yeah,tom.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.810
-You remember...
-Derek.

22:13.830 --> 22:16.040
From the meetings?

22:16.060 --> 22:17.730
-We talked a couple of times.
-Yes,we did.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.270
Briefly.Sort of.

22:20.290 --> 22:24.140
Derek was wondering
if you would be his sponsor.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.090
I--I don't know if
I'm ready for that.I mean...

22:27.110 --> 22:29.160
You had your hand up the other night.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.970
I know,but I was actually going to ask
a couple of questions about the cookies.

22:31.990 --> 22:35.970
-That's why--
-Excuse me.

22:35.990 --> 22:37.950
-What do you think--
-If you hit me right now,I'm going to hit back.

22:37.970 --> 22:39.640
I'm not going to hit you.

22:39.660 --> 22:44.650
This is what we talked about the other day
in the bar--your recommitment to sobriety.

22:44.670 --> 22:47.220
The other day when I almost
caught you drinking in a bar.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.260
When you almost caught me--
you almost made me drink.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.660
Is that what you're talking about?

22:50.680 --> 22:52.960
Are you kidding me?
You almost got me to drink again,

22:52.980 --> 22:55.480
and now,you want me
to baby-sit some guy named dirk?

22:55.500 --> 22:56.480
-Dwayne.
-Derek.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.600
Whatever.Listen to me.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.880
This will be good for you,ok?
It'll keep your head in the game.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.690
It'll be good for you,
me,him,all around.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.020
Tommy,I need to talk to you.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.920
-I'm in the middle of something.
-It's really important.

23:05.940 --> 23:07.680
-Give me a second.
-It can't wait.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.760
What?

23:10.410 --> 23:14.720
See,you don't know me all that well,
but I'm the kind of guy,I put it all out there.

23:14.740 --> 23:16.520
The cards are always
out on the table with me.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.030
I don't hide shit.All right?

23:18.050 --> 23:20.800
'Cause I don't have to.I'm not
the kind of human being that does that.

23:20.820 --> 23:25.210
You're always going to hear straight
from me,I mean,the good and the bad.

23:25.230 --> 23:28.300
Yeah.Ok.S...

23:28.320 --> 23:31.320
what are we--
what are we talking about here?

23:31.340 --> 23:33.420
It can wait.

23:36.020 --> 23:37.860
What the hell was that about?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.850
So,we're all good,huh?

23:41.870 --> 23:45.720
-I-- I gave him your number already.
-You did?Ok.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.010
Great.

23:47.030 --> 23:50.610
I promise not
to call or bother you too much.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.740
Don't worry about that.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.770
Just--you know,call me whenever.

23:53.790 --> 23:54.870
Thanks.

23:54.890 --> 23:58.430
Call me anytime,paulie.

23:58.450 --> 24:01.840
-Derek.
-Right.

24:01.860 --> 24:05.370
I know it's been
40 minutes since I last saw you.

24:05.390 --> 24:06.740
Has it been that long?

24:06.760 --> 24:11.200
Just that I walked past this bar,and people
are inside drinking and having a great time,

24:11.220 --> 24:13.680
and I was thinking,
"why can't I have a good time?

24:13.700 --> 24:14.630
" Ok.

24:14.650 --> 24:22.040
Here's one reason--you're a lying,
thieving scumbag raging alcoholic,so for you,

24:22.060 --> 24:24.860
a good time would include,
you know,like,12 cocktails

24:24.880 --> 24:26.860
and probably eventually pissing in
the sink in the ladies' room.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.390
I don't think they
would find that a good time.

24:29.410 --> 24:32.290
Ok.Thanks,tom.

24:32.310 --> 24:35.270
Might I have a moment,mr.Gavin?

24:36.430 --> 24:37.700
Mm,I don't think so.

24:37.720 --> 24:42.640
I've talked to several of the other men in the house,
and your name seems to come up quite a bit in their stories.

24:42.660 --> 24:46.530
Well,I-- I was hoping we could
sit down and get some recollections.

24:46.550 --> 24:48.990
All right.Well,I don't know how much
you overheard,but there's a good chance

24:49.010 --> 24:52.310
I'm not going to be in this house for too
much longer,so you'd just be wasting your time.

24:52.330 --> 24:55.820
Even so,if we could speak...

24:56.220 --> 24:57.920
All right.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.870
What,uh...

24:59.890 --> 25:02.550
what is your book?
What's it going to be?

25:02.570 --> 25:06.140
Um,well,comprehensive,uh,hopefully.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.770
Comprehensive,which means,like,
big with lots of pretty pictures,right?

25:10.790 --> 25:12.700
It will be tastefully done.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.050
Tasteful.I'm sure it will be.

25:15.070 --> 25:17.850
I'm glad that you're
going to do it tastefully,

25:17.870 --> 25:20.840
'cause if you're going
to do a book about the biggest,

25:20.860 --> 25:25.690
blackest tragedy in the
history of this country since the...

25:25.710 --> 25:31.590
goddamn civil war,you know,you'd want
to make sure it's got,you know,big glossy pages.

25:31.610 --> 25:33.310
And that's important.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.020
You know what you should do?

25:35.040 --> 25:36.730
A black cover.

25:36.750 --> 25:40.800
Like the white album-- you know,
the beatles--except just black 'cause that's cool.

25:40.820 --> 25:42.170
Black is like the new white.

25:42.190 --> 25:44.640
It would probably look
nice on a big coffee table.

25:44.660 --> 25:46.460
You can--you can
have that idea for free.

25:46.480 --> 25:50.560
I should assume you're not
interested in being involved?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.990
Not really.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.270
I'll tell you what,though.

25:54.290 --> 25:57.770
You could save yourself
a lot of note-taking and crap.

25:57.790 --> 26:02.240
Just go to ground zero and spend,like,the afternoon
there and really take a look at the footprint down there.

26:02.260 --> 26:04.370
I've seen it.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.600
Well,then,you know.

26:07.620 --> 26:09.400
That's how big your book should be.

26:09.420 --> 26:17.770
Big,coffee table-sized book that's actually
the same size as that 2 city blocks,ok?

26:17.790 --> 26:20.920
You know,this kind of crap,it's not...

26:20.940 --> 26:23.820
I don't know what you're trying
to accomplish with it,you know?

26:23.840 --> 26:27.910
You're not going to help
the people that were left behind--

26:27.930 --> 26:31.700
mothers,fathers,daughters,the kids.

26:31.720 --> 26:38.140
You know,if you had a kid that was 7 years old then,
and you were a firefighter who died on that day,

26:38.160 --> 26:39.700
that kid's,like,15 years old now.

26:39.720 --> 26:42.840
And I guarantee you that,a least a couple of times
a week,that kid will hear a key in the lock and think,

26:42.860 --> 26:47.210
"oh,maybe daddy's finally home from work.

26:47.230 --> 26:51.440
" I know a couple of widows who
can't sleep through the night because,

26:51.460 --> 26:55.040
you know,the bed just
doesn't feel right without him in it.

26:55.060 --> 26:59.990
And they're not really interested
in meeting some other goddamn guy.

27:02.770 --> 27:05.320
I don't know.I mean,
what do you want?You want to--

27:05.340 --> 27:08.030
you want me to talk about how...

27:08.050 --> 27:13.700
you know,people were jumping from 100 stories up
and exploding like goddamn water balloons

27:13.720 --> 27:18.240
as we were trying to go in
to save them?Is that what you want?

27:18.950 --> 27:21.600
You know,I know it's just
a date to you,or that,you know,

27:21.620 --> 27:24.640
9/11 is the title of your new project.

27:24.660 --> 27:28.000
But you know,for a guy like me...

27:28.020 --> 27:29.980
you know,it's a monster.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.260
And I'm not really--real--
I don't want to talk about it.

27:35.280 --> 27:42.940
I don't want to just let it out because some hot
foreign piece of ass thinks it's an interesting idea.

27:44.770 --> 27:48.110
May I quote you,mr.Gavin?

27:50.590 --> 27:52.650
Yeah.

27:56.230 --> 27:58.900
Hello?

27:59.980 --> 28:02.040
Janet?

28:02.660 --> 28:04.340
Tommy?

28:04.360 --> 28:05.800
What are you doing here?

28:05.820 --> 28:07.310
I told you to call first.

28:07.330 --> 28:09.090
I know.

28:09.110 --> 28:10.880
Look,I just got out of the shower.

28:10.900 --> 28:15.280
Don't come in.Go outside and wait.
I'm going to be right down.

28:15.300 --> 28:18.070
-Tommy?
-Yeah,yeah.

28:18.090 --> 28:20.930
All right.See you in a couple.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.730
Hey,bro.

28:31.660 --> 28:35.610
Well,well,well look who it is.

28:37.410 --> 28:38.440
Go outside.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.080
It's fine.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.080
So,how's life in the firefighting racket?

28:42.100 --> 28:43.420
Good.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.140
How's life in the,uh...

28:46.160 --> 28:50.150
laying around on the couch,
reading magazines racket?

28:51.160 --> 28:52.920
-You're a funny guy.
-I know.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.820
Put it here.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.190
No.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.510
No.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.540
See-- I pay the rent in this house.

29:01.560 --> 29:08.560
I paid for that couch with my
hard-earned firefighting racket cabbage.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.310
I probably paid for that
magazine that you're reading.

29:11.330 --> 29:12.950
So here's what I'd like to do.

29:12.970 --> 29:17.930
I'd like you,this time,to get off your
hindquarters and come over here--

29:17.950 --> 29:20.100
And put it there.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.510
You want me to get up for you?

29:24.480 --> 29:26.660
Yeah.

29:27.470 --> 29:29.880
What if that doesn't appeal to me?

29:29.900 --> 29:32.350
Maybe this will appeal to you,then.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.330
I'm going to kick your ass.How's that?

29:34.350 --> 29:35.930
Well,that's a banana when you peel it.

29:35.950 --> 29:38.370
Oh,great.Let's go.Outside.Let's go.

29:38.390 --> 29:40.290
-You didn't wait outside.
-No,I did not wait outside.

29:40.310 --> 29:43.360
But I'm just on my way outside 'cause
we're going to have a little ass-kicking contest.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.940
Uh,dwight,
you're not going to do this.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.050
I definitely have to do this.
Get the chair.

29:47.070 --> 29:48.920
Oh,well,forget the chair.
I'm going to get something.

29:48.940 --> 29:49.750
I'm going to get a book.

29:49.770 --> 29:51.910
-Get a big book,something to read in the hospital.
-Got a big book,ok?

29:51.930 --> 29:53.370
Get the chair,janet.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.780
-I'm coming!Get the chair.
-Wait,wait,wait,wait.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.180
Sorry.What is this?

29:57.200 --> 29:58.330
A wheelchair.

29:58.350 --> 29:59.600
I know it's a wheelchair.What--

29:59.620 --> 30:00.730
What,are you backing down now?

30:00.750 --> 30:02.890
Wait.I didn't know that you were--

30:02.910 --> 30:04.740
-He's getting cold feet.
-I'm not getting co--

30:04.760 --> 30:06.760
hey,at least I can feel my feet.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.080
-You are prick.
-Chair.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.810
-Don't sick to his level,please!
-This is ridiculous,ok?

30:10.830 --> 30:12.110
-I'm not doing it.
-Don't go.

30:12.130 --> 30:13.910
Hey,wait.Wait.
Bring the chair over here,janet.

30:13.930 --> 30:14.930
Bring me the freakin' chair!

30:14.950 --> 30:17.140
-Forget about it.I'm not
-No way.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.110
-Come back,asshole!
-Go outside.Stop!

30:19.130 --> 30:20.640
Come back here!I'll kick your ass.

30:20.660 --> 30:21.910
You're going to kick my ass?

30:21.930 --> 30:24.100
You want me to lay down on
the floor so you can drive over my ass?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.670
-That's a start.
-You start it,pal.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.970
-Janet,bring the friggin--
-Whatever.

30:27.990 --> 30:30.610
You know what?You are unbelievable.

30:30.630 --> 30:32.040
Unbelievable.

30:32.060 --> 30:34.900
-Crippled and crazy.What a great combination.
--Oh,and you're still going on about it.

30:34.920 --> 30:38.360
You know what?This is the reason why
you can't just come over without calling first.

30:38.380 --> 30:39.420
Yeah,'cause he's out of his mind.

30:39.440 --> 30:43.550
No,because 4 minutes earlier,
you would have walked in on us having sex.

30:43.570 --> 30:46.640
-Who?
-Dwight and me.

30:46.660 --> 30:48.160
Having--hav--what kind of sex?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.700
Sex.Sex sex.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.760
-Like,regular--
-With his penis.

30:53.780 --> 30:57.870
His penis gets hard at random times,
and so,we have sex when that happens.

30:57.890 --> 31:05.920
And since he doesn't have full sensation,
it lasts a really,really,really long time.

31:08.740 --> 31:11.090
See ya.

31:11.110 --> 31:14.610
Could have done without the last really.

31:14.630 --> 31:17.040
At least I can walk.

31:17.060 --> 31:19.160
Yeah?Well,you can,so...

31:19.180 --> 31:21.130
Well,I'm going.

31:21.150 --> 31:24.780
-Call me.
-Janet!

31:24.800 --> 31:27.450
Oh,I'm getting a hard-on.

31:28.870 --> 31:32.240
Hey,guys,I got to tell you,
the place looks amazing.

31:32.260 --> 31:35.890
-It's great.
-I don't know whether to bring down some big timber or drink till I piss myself.

31:35.910 --> 31:37.280
Good shit,y'all.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.550
Think y'all about ready to open.

31:38.570 --> 31:40.030
Let's do it.

31:40.050 --> 31:41.470
There's only one problem,mikey.

31:41.490 --> 31:42.590
No booze.

31:42.610 --> 31:43.830
Oh,we got booze.

31:43.850 --> 31:48.510
I got this thinking we would smash it against
her hull,but since we didn't build a hull,

31:48.530 --> 31:50.210
I figure we should
just drink it right now.

31:50.230 --> 31:53.230
-Crack it open.
-All right.That's my cue to get going.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.450
Wait a second.You're not going to stay?
We got,like,a whole thing we're going to do.

31:55.470 --> 31:57.420
Well,I got to get down to headquarters.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.300
You know,today's the day.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.850
Oh,right,right.

32:00.870 --> 32:02.730
-See you.
-All right,man.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.890
-Good luck.
-Good luck,tommy.

32:06.250 --> 32:10.180
You know,guys,I should really...

32:10.200 --> 32:13.700
uh,I'm sure you're aware,if this doesn't
go my way,which it probably won't,

32:13.720 --> 32:15.260
they're going to put
me on immediate light duty,

32:15.280 --> 32:17.450
and the odds are I'm not going
to be coming back to the firehouse.

32:17.470 --> 32:20.210
We've spoken about this.
I just wanted to say--

32:20.230 --> 32:22.200
No,no,no,tom.
You don't have to say anything.

32:22.220 --> 32:23.690
Been an honor working with you.

32:23.710 --> 32:24.700
No,ok.All right.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.970
Let me just get this out of the way 'cause
I just want to make it--say it out loud,ok?

32:27.990 --> 32:32.660
As firefighters,for whatever reason,
you know,it's like a football team.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.240
Our pluses and our minuses
balanced out,and we made a great team.

32:35.260 --> 32:37.100
We really did.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.090
And I felt really
safe working with you guys.

32:40.110 --> 32:42.090
You saved my asses
many times and vice versa.

32:42.110 --> 32:44.740
But you know,I felt blessed,ok?

32:44.760 --> 32:47.330
-The other thing i want to say--
-There's no need.Feeling's mutual.

32:47.350 --> 32:48.640
Shut up.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.060
Let me just say this stuff
very quickly,'cause it needs to be said

32:51.080 --> 32:55.180
in case the guy who comes in and is standing
in my shoes next doesn't have it out on the table.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.290
I'll do it for him.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.690
Number one,you're a moron.

32:57.710 --> 33:01.990
Don't argue with me,because you proved it
in spades when you married my goddamn sister,ok?

33:02.010 --> 33:03.800
What are you laughing about?

33:03.820 --> 33:06.990
Because if he's a moron,
you're the king of the morons.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.620
Don't give me the look.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.720
Do me a favor.Spell moron.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.090
Spell what?

33:14.110 --> 33:18.500
Franco,I really wish you weren't
the guy that laughed the hardest at that because

33:18.520 --> 33:23.670
if you took just an--one iota of the energy
that you spend every day chasing pussy

33:23.690 --> 33:26.850
and you put it into something
good like,you know,helping mankind,

33:26.870 --> 33:29.570
pretty sure at this point,we'd have
stitched up the hole in the ozone layer,

33:29.590 --> 33:34.310
there'd be no more wars,and this party
would be in a bar owned by you on the planet neptune.

33:34.330 --> 33:36.760
You,i really can't say anything
too negative about you

33:36.780 --> 33:39.670
because i don't know you well
enough,and it wouldn't be fair to judge you.

33:39.690 --> 33:41.280
But life's unfair,
so let me get it out of the way.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.500
You probably suck,too.

33:43.520 --> 33:50.580
And this,my best friend,who's not only a loser
with women and a giant slob but a goddamn lush.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.530
Case closed.
So what does that say about me?

33:53.550 --> 33:55.710
Good luck,guys.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.210
See you later.

34:02.410 --> 34:04.830
Hey,you shaved.

34:04.850 --> 34:06.810
Oh,yeah.

34:07.750 --> 34:09.170
Yes,mrs.Berg.

34:09.190 --> 34:11.300
I do believe that
this is extremely important.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.040
Otherwise,I wouldn't have
called you all the way down here.

34:13.060 --> 34:14.800
So,what's the issue?

34:14.820 --> 34:16.780
Kaleena tells me you
had a great day together.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.790
That we did.

34:17.810 --> 34:19.989
At least,i thought that we did.

34:20.010 --> 34:24.699
I am sickened to discover
that she has stolen from me.

34:24.719 --> 34:25.989
What?

34:26.010 --> 34:27.080
Oh,you're good.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.370
I didn't steal anything.

34:28.389 --> 34:32.570
Last time you were here,
i put my iphone on that coffee table.

34:32.590 --> 34:35.679
Next time I looked,
after you left,it was gone.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.100
I just want my phone back.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.690
Return my phone,
and I won't call the police.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.820
Are you sure you
didn't misplace the phone?

34:41.840 --> 34:44.719
I think that instead of pointing
the finger at the victim that

34:44.739 --> 34:47.100
maybe you should be looking
in a certain someone's backpack.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.190
-Mrs.Keefe--
-See?

34:49.210 --> 34:50.139
That's my phone.

34:50.159 --> 34:51.489
This is my phone,lady.

34:51.510 --> 34:56.750
Yeah,well,that's my ring,junior mint,
so I think we better be checking your pockets.

34:58.370 --> 35:01.210
Is this yours?

35:01.230 --> 35:02.510
I do not believe so.

35:02.530 --> 35:04.240
Oh,so there's just an iphone
in your couch cushions.

35:04.260 --> 35:05.770
I don't know.Don't ask me.You found it.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.720
-You said that's your ring.
-Nobody's talking to you,ok?

35:07.740 --> 35:09.660
A million people have that ring.
It comes with the phone.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.600
It doesn't prove that it's my phone.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.880
Just give me the goddamn phone.

35:18.260 --> 35:20.850
We'll be going now.Come on,kaleena.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.880
Dumb bitch.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.450
Did you just hear what she--
she just called me a dumb bitch!

35:25.470 --> 35:28.360
I got a lot of love to give.

35:28.380 --> 35:32.840
Who keeps calling me?

35:32.860 --> 35:34.690
I told you you can call me anytime.

35:34.710 --> 35:35.960
Don't apologize for calling.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.930
It's just that I'm actually
on my way to a meeting,

35:37.950 --> 35:40.150
so I'm going to be in there for,
like,an hour or whatever.So,uh...

35:40.170 --> 35:42.500
So,should I call you in an hour?

35:42.520 --> 35:46.410
Uh-- I think i could
be in there for 2 hours.

35:46.430 --> 35:47.600
I don't know.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.540
I'll call you in 2 hours.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.090
-Well,um--
-Wait,wait,wait.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.460
I'm going through--

35:54.480 --> 35:56.350
It's really close.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.500
I walked away to
the trash for 2 seconds.

36:09.520 --> 36:10.670
She could have killed me.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.510
Do me a favor,
will you?Call 911,all right?

36:13.530 --> 36:15.520
-Yo,buddy,my propane.
-What?

36:15.540 --> 36:17.750
My propane tank,it's under the car!

36:17.770 --> 36:19.260
Shit!Get these people
out of here.Hurry up.

36:19.280 --> 36:22.060
Come on.Let's get
out of here,guys,come on!

36:22.080 --> 36:24.290
Oh,drink,asshole,drink!

36:24.310 --> 36:27.260
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

37:08.140 --> 37:11.090
Let's see what we got here.

37:11.110 --> 37:17.550
You dress up in your dead cousin's gear and go out
on calls with your crew and the crew on another shift.

37:17.570 --> 37:23.070
You hide in the truck,and you
go out on calls as your dead cousin.

37:23.090 --> 37:25.390
This dead cousin thing.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.510
What is up with that?

37:30.560 --> 37:35.880
After 9/11--it's kind of complicated,
but basically,in a nutshell,

37:38.030 --> 37:43.430
uh--had some fights with my wife,
drinking,pills-- lot of pills,lot of drinking--

37:43.450 --> 37:46.170
and my brother and
my wife had an affair.

37:46.190 --> 37:48.780
And he's dead now.So...

37:50.590 --> 37:53.710
and then,I quit drinking
and the pills and everything.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.830
So...

37:59.990 --> 38:00.990
Ok.Get out of here.

38:01.010 --> 38:02.640
I didn't kill him,my brother.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.290
It's ok.Go.

38:06.360 --> 38:10.330
You know,guys like you,you know,you just--
I get,what,4 seconds to explain myself?

38:10.350 --> 38:12.760
-I've been fighting fires--
-Mr.Gavin,go back to work.

38:12.780 --> 38:14.690
You're cleared.

38:14.710 --> 38:17.320
Case dismissed.

38:18.450 --> 38:21.190
-Go back to the firehouse?
-Look,mr.Gavin.You're a vet.

38:21.210 --> 38:23.830
You've got all the years,
the saves,the medal recommendations.

38:23.850 --> 38:25.990
-That's right.
-Whack job or not,

38:26.010 --> 38:28.290
the department can't
afford to lose guys like you.

38:28.310 --> 38:32.390
Maybe you're a little nuts,yeah,
but all the guys we lost in the towers,

38:32.410 --> 38:38.040
all the guys who got out after,you know,
there's just too much fresh blood on the job right now.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.580
We need you.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.590
Well,thank you.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.930
So,I'm--I'm not crazy.

38:43.950 --> 38:45.430
Oh,you're crazy.

38:45.450 --> 38:48.940
I mean,you're like margot kidder
hiding in the bushes kind of crazy.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.200
But,you know,
your job is to run at the fire.

38:51.220 --> 38:53.610
You got to be a little crazy,right?

38:53.630 --> 38:55.020
Right.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.910
That's it?

38:57.330 --> 39:02.120
Well,uh,to be honest,there--there was
one big thing that really worked in your favor.

39:02.140 --> 39:05.890
You know this guy,feinberg,the guy
who pulled the section eight on you?

39:05.910 --> 39:09.090
We used to work on the same crew
about a million years ago.Goddamn prick.

39:09.110 --> 39:12.000
He slammed the cabin door
on my hand going to a call.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.840
I've been chained
to the desk thanks to him.

39:14.860 --> 39:17.660
So this is a revenge thing?

39:17.680 --> 39:20.820
Oh,you bet your sweet ass it is.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.600
Thanks.

39:26.980 --> 39:28.430
I know!

39:28.450 --> 39:30.060
-You remember that?
-Crazy.Oh,my god.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.890
Hey,guys.

39:32.910 --> 39:36.770
I got off.It's unbelievable.The guy--

39:36.790 --> 39:39.040
what?

39:39.060 --> 39:42.500
Are you guys pissed off
about what I said before?

39:42.520 --> 39:46.580
I had a hunch.I was playing
a practical joke on you guys.Come on!

39:46.600 --> 39:47.840
Gary.

39:47.860 --> 39:51.090
Like you're as stupid as I--

39:55.560 --> 39:56.720
Look.

39:56.740 --> 39:58.890
Tommy.

39:58.910 --> 40:01.240
-I'm with your daughter.
-Holy shit.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.360
Sorry?

40:06.030 --> 40:07.440
Colleen and me.

40:07.460 --> 40:08.670
We're together.

40:08.690 --> 40:10.360
She's feeling me.

40:10.380 --> 40:11.740
I'm feeling her.

40:11.760 --> 40:15.470
We're in love and we're happy.

40:15.490 --> 40:17.050
So...

40:17.070 --> 40:20.170
what you going to do?

40:27.390 --> 40:28.370
What?

40:28.390 --> 40:29.680
Nothing.What?

40:29.700 --> 40:30.960
What?You've been,like,looking like--

40:30.980 --> 40:32.590
you have this weird blank look
on your face like you're not even here.

40:32.610 --> 40:36.030
-I have an idea,ok?
-What?

40:36.050 --> 40:37.600
It's kinky.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.460
Oh,yeah?What?

40:39.480 --> 40:43.810
Can you do a french accent?

40:43.830 --> 40:46.040
A french accent?

40:46.470 --> 40:47.370
Why?

40:47.390 --> 40:50.550
Do it because it
could be hot,you know.

40:50.570 --> 40:52.810
Sexy.

40:54.210 --> 40:55.740
Ok.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.530
Monsieur.

41:00.550 --> 41:01.200
Oh,yeah.

41:01.220 --> 41:04.800
My name is cecile.

41:04.820 --> 41:07.150
And I am a maid.

41:07.170 --> 41:10.150
And this is my shoe.

41:10.170 --> 41:11.690
That is nice.

41:11.710 --> 41:15.290
It make me feel
like a big,big souffle.

41:15.310 --> 41:16.550
La la.

41:16.570 --> 41:18.950
Oh,monster,monster.

41:18.970 --> 41:21.730
Now,ask me a couple of questions,ok?

41:25.090 --> 41:26.910
What?

41:27.230 --> 41:28.540
Hey,mikey,where you at?

41:28.560 --> 41:31.120
I'm at a bar by 84th and amsterdam
on the north side of the street.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.890
Get your ass over here now.

41:37.690 --> 41:41.740
Well,yeah.I think
maybe I've been here before.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.480
You think?

41:43.500 --> 41:46.050
Asshole.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.270
Well,hey,you want to grab a brew?

41:49.290 --> 41:50.660
Shut up.
