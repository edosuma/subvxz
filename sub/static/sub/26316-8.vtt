WEBVTT

00:05.381 --> 00:06.883
This library's depressing.

00:07.383 --> 00:11.262
All they have in the Poetry section
is Jeff Foxworthy books.

00:11.346 --> 00:14.682
Well, we needed someplace deserted,
and there's no place more deserted

00:14.724 --> 00:18.186
than a public library in Arizona.
Now let's go, man!

00:18.353 --> 00:20.480
We only have a few hours
before we have to pick the gang up

00:20.563 --> 00:22.982
from the airport -
fire up Janet's memory gizmo.

00:23.358 --> 00:26.528
Flooding your brain with memories
from the afterlife is dangerous.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.572
In one of the reboots,
you and Chidi were in love.

00:29.656 --> 00:32.534
- Can't you just take my word for that?
- No, dude, I can't.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.328
My screwed-up relationship
with my parents made me believe

00:35.411 --> 00:38.373
I could never really love anyone.
I need to see it for myself.

00:38.832 --> 00:41.292
Those are my memories.
I want them back.

00:41.376 --> 00:43.211
OK. Fine. Have a seat.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.506
Luckily, before we shut
the Neighbourhood down

00:46.673 --> 00:50.385
Janet saved a complete record
of all the reboots.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.553
Put those in your ears.

00:56.558 --> 00:57.976
- What's all that for?
- You'll see.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.603
We're gonna start with a simple,
three-second memory.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.605
Why only three secon--?

01:03.356 --> 01:05.608
- Oh, hi, Eleanor!
<i>- Buongiorno,</i> Eleanor!

01:05.817 --> 01:07.569
Morning, Bambadjan! Morning, Vicky!

01:07.861 --> 01:10.738
Ugh. Those two are such forking dweebs.

01:11.531 --> 01:13.283
As I told you...

01:13.449 --> 01:17.912
Recalling afterlife memories here on Earth
has some... significant side-effects.

01:18.705 --> 01:21.457
You should be back to normal
in about 20 minutes.

01:33.219 --> 01:35.930
Ah, looking a little better.
The banana must have helped.

01:36.014 --> 01:38.683
Before we go any further,
I have one very important question...

01:38.892 --> 01:40.685
Did I look hot bald?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.812
Cos I always kinda
felt like I could pull it off.

01:42.896 --> 01:46.566
I have no real ability to gauge
physical attractiveness in humans.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.694
But no, you did not "pull it off."

01:49.736 --> 01:54.240
OK, that short clip should have
rewired your brain, like an inoculation.

01:54.449 --> 01:58.077
So, now I can show you the highlights
of reboot 119.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.663
I'm skipping all of the
sleeping and chewing.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.415
You guys are always either sleeping

02:02.498 --> 02:04.375
or chewing something.

02:06.127 --> 02:11.090
So... we are moving on to the subject
of free will versus determinism.

02:11.341 --> 02:13.051
We are officially done with Nietzsche.

02:13.218 --> 02:15.303
Aw. I'm gonna miss Nietzsche.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.473
I spent a lot of my life thinking
I was better than everyone else

02:18.723 --> 02:20.767
and he showed me why I was right.

02:21.226 --> 02:23.269
Gimme that reading list.
What have we got...?

02:23.603 --> 02:26.272
Oh, a little Aristotle, a little Descartes

02:26.648 --> 02:29.943
a little Tommy Quine-Quine.
That's what I call Saint Thomas Aquinas.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.612
Three months of philosophy class,
and you're already...

02:37.951 --> 02:38.952
Hm...

02:42.247 --> 02:44.207
What are you grinning at, weirdo?

02:46.167 --> 02:48.044
Come on, we're gonna be late
for the Neighbourhood meeting.

02:48.086 --> 02:49.796
I gotta say

02:49.921 --> 02:52.173
it seems like I was really
nailing that philosophy class.

02:52.674 --> 02:54.217
Can you believe my high school voted me

02:54.300 --> 02:56.302
"Most Likely to Die Young and
Unaccomplished"?

02:56.761 --> 02:58.846
You did die young and unaccomplished.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.932
- Fair enough.
- Put those back in.

03:02.225 --> 03:05.019
Ah! My favourite four residents!

03:05.561 --> 03:07.855
Don't tell the others.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.941
Welcome to "Pick a Pet Day".

03:10.066 --> 03:13.486
We have hundreds of beautiful animals
for you to choose from.

03:13.653 --> 03:19.284
And when you do make your choice,
your pet will bond to your soul forever.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.328
Fabulous! I haven't had a pet
since Barbara Streisand gave me

03:22.370 --> 03:23.955
one of her cloned Siamese cats

03:24.038 --> 03:25.999
- and it killed itself.
- Ah.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.918
I'm going to look at the mythical pets,
darling. Catch up when you're ready.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.086
- May I?
- Yes.

03:31.462 --> 03:34.382
Dude, we can get mythical animals?
Maybe I'll get a penguin!

03:34.716 --> 03:35.758
Penguins are real.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.927
That's the spirit, Eleanor!

03:38.386 --> 03:39.679
They're real to me too.

03:43.933 --> 03:48.104
Ooh! This one looks just like
the one I had when I was a little kid.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.106
He's so cute!

03:51.441 --> 03:53.901
But is... is... is this one a little...
a little cuter?

03:55.153 --> 03:57.864
I mean, this pup looks friskier, but...

03:57.947 --> 04:00.742
this one looks a little sweeter? Maybe?

04:00.950 --> 04:04.287
Uh-oh. It's Chidi kryptonite,
the choice between any two things.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.039
Settle in, lizard.

04:06.122 --> 04:07.332
This is gonna be a while.

04:08.791 --> 04:11.044
Michael? What's a "Mirror Centaur?"

04:11.377 --> 04:13.504
Ah, a stunning creature

04:14.047 --> 04:17.008
whose human half
takes on the image of its companion.

04:18.843 --> 04:23.139
Greetings. I am T'Hania, Goddess of Beauty.

04:24.557 --> 04:25.850
Oh, my!

04:26.934 --> 04:29.520
I mean, should I take the cutest
puppy, or is that shallow?

04:29.687 --> 04:34.025
And is it even OK to separate them?
Are they brother and sister, or...

04:34.192 --> 04:35.651
or perhaps married?

04:35.735 --> 04:37.070
Dude, they're heaven-puppies.

04:37.153 --> 04:39.655
I'm sure they're both incredible.
Just choose one.

04:40.198 --> 04:41.783
You're right. The black one!

04:42.116 --> 04:44.077
That was my first impulse,
and that is the one I'll take!

04:44.827 --> 04:47.497
I'm so sorry, Chidi...
both puppies have been taken.

04:47.622 --> 04:49.332
Yeah, I should've seen that coming.

04:49.832 --> 04:52.543
My indecision has once again
cost me happiness

04:52.752 --> 04:54.670
and I will now suffer the consequences.

04:55.421 --> 04:56.756
How many pets have gone unclaimed?

04:56.923 --> 05:00.385
Three. A 16-foot albino python...
Mm-mm!

05:00.551 --> 05:04.514
Something called a "tarantula-squid,"
and this owl!

05:04.555 --> 05:06.682
The tarantula-squid! Tarantula-squid!

05:06.766 --> 05:08.643
Tarantula-squid! Tarantula-squid!

05:08.726 --> 05:09.769
I'll take the owl.

05:10.395 --> 05:13.231
Check it out!
Janet made him a little cowboy hat!

05:13.314 --> 05:14.524
Isn't that stupid?

05:14.732 --> 05:17.402
Chidi? Hello?

05:17.485 --> 05:19.737
Shh! Spencer doesn't like loud voices!

05:20.279 --> 05:22.365
Yeesh, what happened, man?

05:22.448 --> 05:26.869
Well, I was trying to teach him to play
"fetch," like I did with my puppy as a kid.

05:27.245 --> 05:30.998
But instead of retrieving the stick,
he attacked my face

05:31.207 --> 05:32.708
with his razor-sharp talons.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.336
Why don't you just ask Michael for a dog?

05:35.545 --> 05:38.214
Because it was my mistake
to not pick a puppy fast enough.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.134
I made my bed, and now I'll... bleed in it.

05:41.843 --> 05:43.344
Let me do that, dummy. Come here.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.140
What if I talk to Michael for you?

05:47.265 --> 05:50.435
That way you don't have to worry about
feeling ungrateful, or whatever

05:50.518 --> 05:53.813
and maybe you'll still get a puppy,
instead of...

05:53.896 --> 05:54.814
Ow!

05:54.939 --> 05:56.149
Deep wounds.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.943
- You'd do that?
- Of course! It's the least I can do

05:59.026 --> 06:00.987
considering everything you've done for me.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.741
So you get it, right?

06:05.825 --> 06:06.784
- Hey!
- What?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.411
You liked him, he liked you

06:08.494 --> 06:10.037
you did nice things for each other.

06:10.121 --> 06:12.874
Your lack of parental affection
did not make you numb

06:12.957 --> 06:14.500
to love, blah, blah, blah.

06:14.584 --> 06:15.877
"Blah, blah, blah?"

06:15.960 --> 06:18.671
Why don't you want me to see this?
What are you hiding?

06:18.963 --> 06:22.175
Nothing.
It's just the rest is not interesting.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.469
Yeah, no, you're right,
"not that interesting."

06:24.552 --> 06:27.555
Just watching myself fall in love
for the first time in fake heaven.

06:27.638 --> 06:28.598
What else is on?

06:29.348 --> 06:33.060
I am going to put this back in my ear,
and you are going to show me

06:33.269 --> 06:36.481
how thoughtful and caring I am,
or I'm gonna rip off your demon head

06:36.564 --> 06:39.984
and shove it up whatever's where
your butt should be. Roll it!

06:43.696 --> 06:46.365
Oh...
a lizard was a perfect choice, Eleanor.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.284
You both have combination skin!

06:48.743 --> 06:52.705
Thanks. Hey, this is a weird question to ask,
I'll just throw it out there

06:52.788 --> 06:53.998
can I ride your centaur?

06:54.081 --> 06:58.294
I'm afraid T'Hania's quite particular
about whom she allows to ride her.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.797
I tried, and she gave me a withering stare.

07:02.215 --> 07:03.758
Turns out centaurs are a bit tricky.

07:03.925 --> 07:06.886
You didn't have, like,
a stable full of horses growing up?

07:07.178 --> 07:09.096
Oh, of course, but they just pulled
our carriages

07:09.138 --> 07:11.599
or performed in our horse ballets.
They weren't so...

07:12.183 --> 07:13.309
what's the word?

07:13.809 --> 07:14.810
Judgmental.

07:14.936 --> 07:17.146
With whom can I speak
about acquiring new shoes?

07:17.355 --> 07:19.273
You can't expect me to walk around
in these flats all day

07:19.357 --> 07:21.692
like some common glue-factory hobo horse.

07:21.776 --> 07:23.194
Eleanor? You were looking for me?

07:23.277 --> 07:24.612
Uh, yeah! So...

07:24.862 --> 07:27.698
Chidi chose an owl,
because he froze up trying to decide

07:27.782 --> 07:30.368
between two puppies.
Is it possible for him to swap?

07:30.576 --> 07:32.453
Of course! This is the Good Place!

07:33.371 --> 07:35.164
But he might want to hold off.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.834
Tonight we're having a party,
where everyone gets to transform

07:38.918 --> 07:41.128
into their pets for a few minutes,
as a treat!

07:41.671 --> 07:43.881
Chidi can fly like an owl, and you can...

07:44.215 --> 07:45.591
do whatever lizards do!

07:46.634 --> 07:49.428
Tahani, would you host the party
at your mansion?

07:49.679 --> 07:51.597
Of course! I'd love to.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.267
Is that what you're going to wear?

07:54.850 --> 07:56.519
What? N-no, no...

07:56.602 --> 07:58.271
Of course not!

07:58.396 --> 08:00.940
Why? Is it unflattering?

08:01.357 --> 08:02.567
I... I can change!

08:04.026 --> 08:05.736
Guys, I can't find my lizard.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.905
He was just out there,
like, one second ago.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.824
No big deal. Janet can find it.

08:09.949 --> 08:11.367
No, I can't risk it.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.620
These pets are supposed to, like,
bond to our souls forever.

08:14.704 --> 08:17.039
If Michael finds out mine ran away,
he could figure out

08:17.123 --> 08:18.457
I'm not the real Eleanor.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.543
Just, um... go without me.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.170
And tell people that I'm hanging out
with my lizard

08:23.254 --> 08:27.675
because we are so meshed together or
whatever, circle of life, crap like that.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.343
- You sure?
- Yeah.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.846
Go enjoy flying. I'll meet you there.

08:31.971 --> 08:32.847
Come on, Blake!

08:34.640 --> 08:36.434
Lizard? Lizard!

08:37.643 --> 08:40.104
Where the fork are you? Lizard!

08:41.147 --> 08:42.732
Ugh! Why didn't I name you?

08:44.567 --> 08:45.610
Hey.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.861
- Why?
- Oh!

08:47.111 --> 08:48.696
Oh, no... Chidi!

08:50.031 --> 08:52.408
Sorry I shoved you, man.
Just been a little jumpy.

08:53.743 --> 08:55.661
Hey, you didn't happen to see
my lizard in the lake

08:55.703 --> 08:56.954
when you were thrashing around down there?

08:57.163 --> 09:00.166
No. It was cold and dark and scary.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.626
But, don't worry.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.169
We'll find him.

09:03.252 --> 09:06.380
Michael and Janet are busy
transforming people anyway

09:06.464 --> 09:08.132
so they didn't even
notice you weren't there.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.593
Holy crap, you're supposed
to be flying right now!

09:10.885 --> 09:13.095
It's no big deal.
I just decided I'd rather be...

09:14.055 --> 09:15.056
helping you.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.808
Than soaring through the air like an owl?

09:18.768 --> 09:19.852
That's amazing.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.647
You're amazing.

09:26.067 --> 09:28.611
<i>After that,
you spent all your time together.</i>

09:28.903 --> 09:30.780
<i>You studied philosophy together.</i>

09:30.988 --> 09:33.324
<i>You even got Chidi
hooked on popcorn shrimp.</i>

09:34.200 --> 09:36.994
<i>Eventually, you became suspicious of me
and escaped</i>

09:37.078 --> 09:39.246
<i>to Mindy Saint Claire's house on a train.</i>

09:39.789 --> 09:42.375
<i>That was the first time you actually
said it out loud.</i>

09:43.167 --> 09:44.210
I love you.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.796
And you don't need to respond, cos...

09:47.630 --> 09:50.216
- I know you have trouble saying how you feel.
- I love you, too.

09:54.845 --> 09:55.846
That's the story.

09:56.222 --> 09:59.725
You're capable of human love.
Congrats! Can we go now?

10:00.017 --> 10:01.060
How did it end?

10:01.394 --> 10:03.813
Like it always did, with me rebooting you.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.315
There's... there's no need to--
Show me, please.

10:08.818 --> 10:10.027
Alright, let's get this over with.

10:10.111 --> 10:12.947
- So, listen, guys...
- No! You... listen!

10:13.239 --> 10:17.827
We just went to Mindy Saint Claire's,
and when she wasn't trying to trick us

10:17.910 --> 10:20.996
into having a threesome, she filled us in on
everything that you've been up to here.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.248
Oh, yeah?

10:22.331 --> 10:24.709
We know this is like the hundredth time
you've tried to torture us

10:24.750 --> 10:26.085
but this time it's different

10:26.460 --> 10:27.545
because...

10:28.254 --> 10:29.255
we're in love.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.633
And love is stronger than anything
you can throw at us.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.260
No, it's not.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.679
"Love is stronger than anything
I can throw at you?"

10:37.388 --> 10:38.764
I could throw an elephant at you.

10:38.973 --> 10:41.684
You think a thrown elephant wouldn't
crush you because of love?

10:42.101 --> 10:43.686
She was speaking metaphorically.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.479
Even metaphorically, it's lame.

10:45.730 --> 10:46.605
It's OK.

10:46.731 --> 10:49.775
No matter what he does,
we will find each other

10:50.401 --> 10:53.362
and we will help each other,
because we're soulmates.

10:56.115 --> 10:59.410
There's no such thing
as "soulmates", you dingus!

11:00.536 --> 11:01.912
I made it up!

11:02.288 --> 11:04.665
I put clowns in your house
because you hate them.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.542
I forced you to choose the lizard

11:06.792 --> 11:09.170
and then I made that lizard run away!

11:09.462 --> 11:11.213
I made it all up!

11:11.422 --> 11:13.758
Don't you understand that? Ugh.

11:15.634 --> 11:18.012
That's why I didn't want to give you
your memories back.

11:18.179 --> 11:20.598
I didn't want you to see how cruel
I used to be.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.893
Plus, I wore a lot of French cuff shirts
back then

11:23.976 --> 11:27.188
I thought it made me look classy.
But it's... it's... it's all embarrassing.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.273
I'm different now, I promise.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.817
I'll swear on a Bible like you humans do.

11:32.026 --> 11:33.277
I could grab one right now, it...

11:33.444 --> 11:35.529
it's the only book they have
in the Sex-Ed section.

11:35.613 --> 11:37.031
I'm not mad at you.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.492
Can't be mad at a demon for being evil.

11:39.950 --> 11:46.248
I'm just sad because I thought
for a second, I could love someone.

11:46.707 --> 11:51.045
But really, it was just you manipulating me
into thinking I loved someone.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.299
So I guess I was right.
I'm incapable of love.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.346
Eh. That's no biggie.
Do you wanna get burgers?

12:03.432 --> 12:06.685
Hang on now, how did you draw
that conclusion?

12:06.936 --> 12:09.563
You just watched yourself fall in love
with Chidi.

12:10.105 --> 12:14.693
No, I didn't. I watched a puppeteer pull
a bunch of strings to make us <i>think</i>

12:14.777 --> 12:15.945
we were in love.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.030
You said it yourself - you made it all up.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.742
OK, yes, I put you and Chidi
in close proximity

12:21.826 --> 12:24.119
because I needed you to drive
each other crazy.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.164
But I never intended for you
to fall in love.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.959
Once you made us bond,
the romance was inevitable.

12:30.084 --> 12:34.255
It's a basic reality show playbook:
put a bunch of attractive young people

12:34.338 --> 12:36.465
in stressful situations,
so they act like idiots

12:36.549 --> 12:37.633
and have sex with each other.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.177
This is all just... determinism.

12:41.053 --> 12:41.929
What?

12:42.096 --> 12:46.225
"Determinism is the theory that we have
no control over our own actions.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.019
Everything we do happens
because of some external force

12:49.144 --> 12:51.230
which exists outside of our control."

12:51.689 --> 12:55.526
I didn't choose to fall in love with Chidi,
because some all-knowing demon, you

12:55.609 --> 12:58.237
- brought us together and scripted our lives.
- That's ridiculous.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.739
I didn't make you kiss Chidi by that lake.

13:00.948 --> 13:01.949
You kinda did.

13:02.283 --> 13:04.368
You orchestrated the whole "Pet Day" thing

13:04.451 --> 13:07.037
manipulated us into
choosing specific animals

13:07.162 --> 13:10.165
made my lizard run away,
which led to Chidi coming to help me find it

13:10.332 --> 13:12.960
which led to us kissing,
which led to us "falling in love."

13:13.252 --> 13:14.545
None of that was my choice.

13:14.837 --> 13:19.550
Everything in my life has been determined
by my upbringing, my genetics

13:20.009 --> 13:23.345
or my environment, and everything
in my afterlife was determined by you.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.723
There is no such thing as free will.

13:26.015 --> 13:27.808
We're closing up soon, guys.

13:27.892 --> 13:30.811
Yeah, can we just have 15 minutes?
We're kind of in the middle of something.

13:30.895 --> 13:32.146
I'd take off if I were you.

13:32.271 --> 13:34.690
The second we close,
they use this place to shoot pornos.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.359
OK.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.155
- You want something to drink?
- Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

13:41.405 --> 13:45.242
But whatever I choose will be the result
of millions of biological

13:45.326 --> 13:48.370
genetic and societal factors
that are entirely outside my control.

13:50.623 --> 13:51.624
Iced tea?

13:51.916 --> 13:53.459
Oh, that sounds good. I'll have one too.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.253
OK. You think you have no free will

13:56.337 --> 14:00.382
because I scripted everything
that happened, right?

14:00.966 --> 14:06.305
All I have to do is prove that you made
one choice that I couldn't anticipate.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.349
Easy.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.062
OK! Here's a perfect example!

14:13.145 --> 14:15.064
In the very first attempt...

14:15.189 --> 14:16.148
- Y--
- Dude, dude, dude!

14:16.690 --> 14:17.858
- What?
- Yelling. You're...

14:18.692 --> 14:21.320
- You're yelling, like, so loudly.
- Oh, sorry.

14:21.946 --> 14:22.905
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

14:23.948 --> 14:26.450
Watch this. It's from the very first attempt.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.161
If anyone...

14:29.662 --> 14:30.913
has any information...

14:31.121 --> 14:32.748
- Oh, boy.
- About any of this...

14:32.831 --> 14:34.041
OK, easy...

14:34.249 --> 14:36.001
I beg you. Tell me.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.170
Hey... I love you, man.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.090
Michael?

14:41.840 --> 14:43.676
The problem in the Neighbourhood...

14:45.302 --> 14:46.720
is me.

14:47.388 --> 14:51.308
You saw your friend in pain,
and you decided to sacrifice yourself

14:51.517 --> 14:52.393
to help him.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.729
That wasn't me pulling a string,
or manipulating you.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.399
In fact, it was the last thing I wanted.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.401
Ruined my whole plan.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.195
- Free will.
- No, dude.

15:03.404 --> 15:07.324
The only reason I cared enough
about Chidi to do that

15:07.408 --> 15:09.660
was because you forced us together

15:10.285 --> 15:12.371
made me feel bad for causing him pain...

15:12.496 --> 15:13.580
- OK, yeah.
- Yeah.

15:13.664 --> 15:17.251
But no, you were constantly doing stuff
I couldn't anticipate.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.421
As a matter of fact,
I complained to you once, right...

15:20.504 --> 15:24.299
right to your face.
I think it was reboot 444.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.593
Now, is Chidi trapped

15:26.635 --> 15:28.053
in the purple space bubble?

15:28.387 --> 15:30.764
Yes. Is he in pain? Almost certainly.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.307
Will he ever get out? No.

15:33.142 --> 15:34.268
- However...
- Uh...

15:34.601 --> 15:36.687
Yeah, uh, wrong one, wrong one,
I mean, that's...

15:37.229 --> 15:39.106
worth watching - it's great, but, uh...

15:39.231 --> 15:40.774
not-not the one I was thinking.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.818
It's probably, uh... 445.

15:48.449 --> 15:49.908
You. In here.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.872
Where am I?

15:55.414 --> 15:56.290
Hell.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.959
You're in hell. Can I ask you something?

15:59.418 --> 16:02.755
Have I missed anything in that freaky
little noodle of yours?

16:03.172 --> 16:05.382
See, I... I've studied everything
about your life.

16:05.591 --> 16:09.511
I know your hopes, your fears,
your psychology, your tendencies.

16:10.512 --> 16:14.808
I know all your private shames, like that
you don't wash your feet in the shower.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.227
Your first concert was Barenaked Ladies

16:17.478 --> 16:22.983
and you have frequent sex dreams
about Sam the Eagle, from the Muppets.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.861
Well, he's very authoritative
and I find that reassuring.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.948
You keep making crazy choices
I don't understand.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.118
Am I missing something?

16:33.368 --> 16:34.995
I'm sorry, can we rewind for a second?

16:35.079 --> 16:36.872
Who are you? Who is that guy?

16:37.331 --> 16:38.290
Am I dead?

16:39.583 --> 16:40.918
Is Sam the Eagle here?

16:41.293 --> 16:42.169
No.

16:42.628 --> 16:45.297
I tried to script your whole afterlife.

16:45.798 --> 16:49.968
And I devised a 15 million-point plan
to torture you.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.305
You made choices I never saw coming.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.600
I call that free will.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.980
What if all <i>your</i> choices are predetermined?

17:02.272 --> 17:04.650
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
- What? We don't know!

17:04.733 --> 17:08.028
Maybe there's a mega-demon
who built a torture chamber for demons

17:08.112 --> 17:10.072
and this whole thing
is just him torturing you?

17:10.531 --> 17:15.619
And maybe... all the mega-demons
are just fulfilling a destiny laid out

17:15.702 --> 17:19.081
by a bunch of super-intelligent
tarantula-squids

17:19.289 --> 17:20.707
who are torturing <i>them...</i>

17:27.005 --> 17:28.173
Why did you do that?

17:28.799 --> 17:30.509
Because I have free will.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.679
And because you're being so... annoying.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.599
Thank you. So sorry that he did that.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.560
Happens all the time.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.396
Usually it's the younger woman doing
it to the older guy, though.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.649
Dude! Not cool.

17:46.150 --> 17:47.151
Disagree.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.944
I think it's the coolest thing
I've ever done.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.281
Do you really not see
what's happening here?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.408
Do you want me to spell it out for you?

17:54.950 --> 17:57.786
This is a defence mechanism, Eleanor.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.665
You saw yourself fall in love with Chidi,
and it freaked you out

18:01.748 --> 18:05.752
to see yourself be so vulnerable,
so you're using determinism

18:05.836 --> 18:08.797
to convince yourself
that those feelings were not real.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.593
- You know, you don't know me, man!
- Yes, I do. I know everything about you.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.219
Remember?

18:14.720 --> 18:17.931
Including that nothing scares you
more than vulnerability.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.766
Ugh! Whatever. Who even cares?

18:19.850 --> 18:23.896
I do. Because if everything is determined,
and we have no free will

18:24.188 --> 18:28.275
then all this stuff we're doing to put
more good into the world is pointless

18:29.193 --> 18:31.111
and I want to believe that it matters.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.449
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna use my free will right now

18:35.532 --> 18:37.743
to go pick up our friends at the airport.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.914
Worst possible use of free will,
but I'm gonna do it anyway

18:42.456 --> 18:43.874
because I care about them.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.588
You might wanna head out too.

18:49.922 --> 18:53.425
We're closing soon, and the second we do,
they use this place to shoot porn.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.266
First class was amazing!

19:01.350 --> 19:05.312
They give you so many free presents.
A shaving kit, an eye mask... Oh, a vest!

19:07.397 --> 19:11.193
Times like this, it's fun to remember
that we're legally married.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.779
That is fun!

19:13.862 --> 19:15.405
Oh, I call window seat!

19:23.288 --> 19:25.040
I'm sorry. You were right.

19:25.123 --> 19:29.753
I was scared about what it all meant,
and I went back to one of my favourite moves

19:30.128 --> 19:31.964
turn on the ol' Blame Hose.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.591
"This is all your fault!"

19:34.841 --> 19:35.926
Apology accepted.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.887
And I'm sorry I dumped
iced tea on your head.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.138
Are you kidding me?

19:40.264 --> 19:42.724
You did exactly what you should do
when your friend is being annoying.

19:42.808 --> 19:43.976
You snapped me out of it.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.311
That's what made me realise, in a weird way

19:46.436 --> 19:49.815
we're the only truly free beings
in the universe

19:49.982 --> 19:52.359
because we actually know
what's up with the afterlife.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.070
And I think that means we need
to be bold.

19:55.821 --> 19:57.781
Take the Soul Squad
to the next level somehow.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.117
You're right.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.121
We need to find someone
who can serve as a...

20:04.579 --> 20:06.290
as a blueprint for humanity.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.710
Someone whose life is so great,
that we can use it as a model

20:09.918 --> 20:12.629
to get as many points
for as many people as possible

20:12.713 --> 20:14.298
and I think I know the perfect person.

20:14.423 --> 20:15.507
Rihanna! Good call.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.634
I don't know her personally,
but I did see her in Vegas once

20:17.718 --> 20:19.761
and her calf brushed up against my tongue.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.597
I licked her leg. I was kicked out.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.309
It's not Rihanna, it's someone way cooler.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.227
Hey, everybody out of the car!

20:28.186 --> 20:29.271
Grab your bags!

20:29.646 --> 20:31.106
We're going to rural Canada!

20:36.737 --> 20:39.698
- Is it ready?
- I guess. We have no idea if it'll work.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.034
Oh, I'm sure it's perfect.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.745
- Give it a try, Shawn!
- Me?

20:45.245 --> 20:47.581
I'm not going through that thing.
She is.

20:48.457 --> 20:50.709
...ask Michael how many times
he rebooted them!

20:50.792 --> 20:52.002
He's lying...

20:52.085 --> 20:54.212
Yeah, zip it, toots. We're way past that.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.007
Where am I? How long was I in there?

20:57.466 --> 20:59.134
You have missed a lot.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.970
Now, go through that makeshift portal,
see if you explode.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.641
This might be gross!

21:12.147 --> 21:13.857
Am I... on Earth?

21:14.274 --> 21:17.736
Did you figure out a way to build
an illegal door to Earth?

21:18.820 --> 21:19.738
Yes.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.115
That's exactly what I did.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.993
- Well, we all helped.
- Shut up, Glenn.
