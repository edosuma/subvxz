00:01.843 --> 00:03.244
A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister.

00:03.278 --> 00:05.146
And then she she asked
me to take her place,

00:05.180 --> 00:07.381
keep the secret, find our real mother

00:07.416 --> 00:09.417
and try to stay alive.

00:09.451 --> 00:12.119
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:12.154 --> 00:14.922
How long could you keep up the lying game?

00:14.956 --> 00:16.323
All I had to do was get a tire iron

00:16.358 --> 00:18.125
and drop it into Mr. Rybak's bag.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.960
Frame himself for murder?

00:19.995 --> 00:21.061
Why would he do that?

00:21.096 --> 00:22.096
To throw us off.

00:22.130 --> 00:23.664
I knew Dad was innocent.

00:23.698 --> 00:24.698
And you never listened

00:24.733 --> 00:25.966
because he's not your real father.

00:26.001 --> 00:27.735
What will it take to make this right?

00:27.769 --> 00:29.603
And if you were to promise me right now

00:29.638 --> 00:30.805
that you have told me everything.

00:30.839 --> 00:33.741
I swear you know everything.

00:33.775 --> 00:34.775
I want you to work things out with Kristin.

00:34.810 --> 00:36.610
And I'd like to be there for you.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.345
I hooked up with Jordan.

00:38.380 --> 00:40.247
Now, it turns out he's my new stepbrother.

00:40.282 --> 00:41.415
You should really think about going solo.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.284
It looks really good on you.

00:43.318 --> 00:44.585
Thayer has always been there for me.

00:44.619 --> 00:47.488
You and Sutton are perfect for each other.

00:47.522 --> 00:49.156
So, it's cool if Ethan and I give in

00:49.191 --> 00:51.025
to the chemistry between us? Yeah.

00:54.296 --> 00:55.329
What took you so long?

01:33.435 --> 01:37.972
Aw, crap.

01:38.006 --> 01:41.141
Morning, sleepyhead.

01:41.176 --> 01:44.078
God, what did I do?

01:44.112 --> 01:45.846
Me.

01:45.881 --> 01:47.014
Several times, actually.

01:47.048 --> 01:49.783
Don't you remember?

01:49.818 --> 01:52.987
I was really drunk.

01:53.021 --> 01:54.755
Ow, I wasn't thinking.

01:54.789 --> 01:57.958
Um, we've both know we've been thinking

01:57.993 --> 01:59.660
about doing that for a while now.

01:59.694 --> 02:00.895
It was only a matter of time.

02:00.929 --> 02:02.796
I never should've come here.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.832
What are you doing? I thought
we'd spend the day together.

02:04.866 --> 02:06.834
I've got school.

02:06.868 --> 02:10.304
Well, you had a good time
last night though, didn't you?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.473
That's not the point, okay?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.408
It was a mistake, Sutton.

02:16.545 --> 02:18.412
Can I have my shirt back?

02:23.518 --> 02:26.287
This is because of Emma, isn't it?

02:26.321 --> 02:28.923
I'm... I'm just really sorry
about the whole thing, okay?

02:28.957 --> 02:30.991
Well, you didn't seem to
be too sorry last night.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.294
I... I know... y... you're right.

02:33.328 --> 02:36.897
You're right and that
just was not fair to you.

02:36.932 --> 02:39.066
I realize that and, um...

02:39.100 --> 02:40.801
I promise it won't happen again.

03:09.764 --> 03:11.799
You really shouldn't have
left the party so early.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.901
You still had guests to entertain.

03:13.935 --> 03:15.035
Like Laurel Mercer?

03:15.070 --> 03:17.972
Admit it: she's just a way for
you to get closer to her dad.

03:18.006 --> 03:20.674
Maybe, but I'd play along if I were you.

03:20.709 --> 03:21.909
'Cause it be a real shame

03:21.943 --> 03:24.078
if some of your past mistakes
were to come to light.

03:24.112 --> 03:25.713
Wouldn't it?

03:28.116 --> 03:29.617
You know what?

03:29.651 --> 03:30.751
We can talk about this later.

03:30.785 --> 03:31.919
'Cause you're late for school.

03:31.953 --> 03:34.021
I hate it when you get parental on me.

03:38.793 --> 03:40.761
Sutton?

03:40.795 --> 03:42.763
How many times do I have to tell you?

03:42.797 --> 03:44.865
I'm sorry, but this is an emergency.

03:44.899 --> 03:47.735
I slept with Ethan.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.737
That's not an emergency.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.938
Unless, of course,

03:50.972 --> 03:52.806
you didn't use protection?

03:52.841 --> 03:54.775
No, I did.

03:54.809 --> 03:58.746
He... he freaked out this morning.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.781
And told me that he
wished it didn't happen.

04:00.815 --> 04:02.683
I'm so sorry, Sutton.

04:02.717 --> 04:03.817
Boys can be so cruel.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.753
This is her fault.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.822
If I could just get rid of Emma,
Ethan will forget about her.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.591
She's your sister.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.759
Someday we're going to be a family again.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.661
And you need to get along with her.

04:13.695 --> 04:15.729
He's holding out hope for her.

04:15.764 --> 04:17.765
Just like your father.

04:17.798 --> 04:21.000
Holding out hope for Kristin.

04:21.036 --> 04:25.739
Amazing how you can make
my problems all about you.

04:25.774 --> 04:27.775
The truth is, you could
learn by my example.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.077
Ted and I kind of had a moment last night.

04:30.111 --> 04:32.613
Yay for you.

04:33.915 --> 04:36.617
Yay for you too.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.086
If you follow my lead.

04:39.120 --> 04:44.024
I don't give up so easily,
and neither should you.

04:53.735 --> 04:57.838
All right, thanks for the ride, man.

04:57.872 --> 04:59.773
Where the hell you been all night?

04:59.808 --> 05:01.942
Screwing up like usual.

05:01.976 --> 05:03.610
You know?

05:03.645 --> 05:05.746
I had to hitch a ride.

05:05.780 --> 05:07.648
You're damn right you screwed up.

05:07.682 --> 05:08.682
Your teacher called.

05:08.717 --> 05:10.651
Mr. Beattie?

05:10.685 --> 05:12.720
You plagiarize a paper?

05:12.754 --> 05:15.756
Sounds like you already
know the answer to that.

05:15.790 --> 05:16.790
Yeah, he ran it through some software.

05:16.825 --> 05:18.025
Found out it was bought online.

05:18.059 --> 05:19.993
Dan, I know I shouldn't
have done that, okay?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.662
Save it, Ethan.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.564
I can't let you go back to juvie.

05:23.598 --> 05:25.566
So I got Beattie to
give you a second chance.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.768
You're going to take an
exam on all the coursework.

05:27.802 --> 05:31.472
It's real simple: you pass
the test, you pass the course.

05:31.506 --> 05:34.241
Okay, thanks.

05:34.275 --> 05:35.375
When is the test?

05:35.410 --> 05:36.477
Tomorrow morning.

05:36.511 --> 05:38.278
It's tomorrow morning?

05:38.313 --> 05:40.214
How am I going to pass
a test tomorrow morning?

05:40.248 --> 05:41.381
I don't know, but you better figure it out

05:41.416 --> 05:42.896
because your whole life depends on it.

05:48.289 --> 05:49.923
What happened to your eye?

05:49.958 --> 05:51.959
I'm just making friends.

05:51.993 --> 05:54.928
Everybody in jail loves the D.A.

05:54.963 --> 05:55.863
Let me get this straight.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.633
Dan, our Dan,

05:59.667 --> 06:02.770
came up with this crazy theory
that I'm trying to frame myself?

06:02.804 --> 06:04.838
You know it makes more
sense than your own theory.

06:04.873 --> 06:06.440
After all, it was a man

06:06.474 --> 06:07.808
who called the waitress to set you up.

06:07.842 --> 06:09.376
Rebecca could've done that.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.444
She could've hired someone.

06:10.478 --> 06:13.580
Or... you made the call yourself.

06:13.615 --> 06:16.150
I thought you were trying
to represent me here.

06:16.184 --> 06:17.317
The objective was to get me out of jail.

06:17.352 --> 06:19.086
Whose side are you on?

06:19.120 --> 06:21.021
When you hired me, you told me

06:21.055 --> 06:23.123
that if you could convince
me of your innocence,

06:23.158 --> 06:25.025
you could convince a jury too. Well...

06:26.327 --> 06:28.262
I'm not as convinced as I used to be.

06:30.865 --> 06:32.766
Pull the waitress's phone records.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.636
That'll prove I didn't make the call.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.805
Dan's already on it.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.606
Should have them this afternoon.

06:39.641 --> 06:42.609
You know, Theresa, you really ought

06:42.644 --> 06:43.811
to keep your eye on the ball.

06:43.845 --> 06:48.415
Rebecca's pulling the strings on this one.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.652
Not me.

06:51.686 --> 06:53.320
I heard the strange ringtone

06:53.354 --> 06:56.456
and I found this hidden in the garage.

06:56.491 --> 06:58.992
- A cell phone?
- Yeah.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.195
I thought the police already
searched your whole house.

07:01.229 --> 07:03.189
Well, I know, it's weird
that they didn't find it,

07:03.198 --> 07:05.899
but it's got to be my dad's,
so I have to turn it in.

07:05.934 --> 07:08.168
No, hold on, we need to check
it and see who he called.

07:08.203 --> 07:09.269
I already did.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.938
All incoming calls were blocked.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.973
And if he made any calls
out, he cleared the log.

07:13.007 --> 07:15.742
Can't you hack into it
and see what he deleted?

07:15.777 --> 07:18.078
But that might be considered
tampering with evidence.

07:18.112 --> 07:19.980
Thayer, this is going to be our only way

07:20.014 --> 07:21.982
we're gonna know what he's
been up to all this time.

07:22.016 --> 07:22.950
Please?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.685
Can you just try?

07:25.887 --> 07:27.421
Okay.

07:27.455 --> 07:28.856
Thank you.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.358
You're welcome.

07:34.562 --> 07:35.796
Aren't they adorable?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.365
I can't believe they finally got together.

07:39.567 --> 07:40.534
She's coming.

07:40.568 --> 07:41.602
Uh, act natural.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.341
Oh, hi.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.343
- Hey, how's everything?
- Hey.

07:49.377 --> 07:52.312
Everything is fine.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.447
Were you spying on me?

07:53.481 --> 07:55.249
Us?

07:56.217 --> 07:57.317
No.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.219
Just came in here to brush my hair.

07:59.254 --> 08:00.888
With my brush?

08:00.922 --> 08:02.856
Okay, we were totally spying.

08:02.891 --> 08:03.891
Oh, my God.

08:03.925 --> 08:06.727
You and Thayer... this is awesome.

08:06.761 --> 08:09.730
Way to hold firm, Laurel.

08:09.764 --> 08:12.032
Mads, you should've come
out and talked to him.

08:12.066 --> 08:13.734
Especially after what happened last night.

08:13.768 --> 08:16.637
Well, his lips seemed pretty busy just now.

08:16.671 --> 08:18.538
So, I figured I'd do it later.

08:18.573 --> 08:19.873
Okay, listen, not to
make this all about me,

08:19.908 --> 08:22.442
but I need to ask you guys a question.

08:23.745 --> 08:26.580
What do you think about
me asking Jordan out?

08:31.419 --> 08:32.419
Okay...

08:32.453 --> 08:33.386
terrible idea.

08:33.421 --> 08:35.455
No...

08:35.490 --> 08:37.323
How well do you know him?

08:37.357 --> 08:39.058
What? You think he's out of my league?

08:39.092 --> 08:41.160
No, of course not.

08:41.195 --> 08:42.095
I just think that...

08:42.130 --> 08:43.363
I think you guys'd be great together.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.198
You should totally go
for it. No reason not to.

08:48.002 --> 08:50.203
This is disgusting!

08:50.238 --> 08:51.972
What is this?

08:52.006 --> 08:53.674
God!

08:53.708 --> 08:54.808
- What's going on?
- Are you okay?

08:54.842 --> 08:56.777
Well, the sink is clogged.

08:56.811 --> 08:59.746
Ew, well, maybe Dad could fix it.

08:59.781 --> 09:01.882
No, I don't want to have
to rely on him right now.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.583
I can take care of this myself.

09:03.618 --> 09:04.918
But I thought therapy went well.

09:04.953 --> 09:07.554
That doesn't mean we are
getting back together.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.656
Have you tried the disposal?

09:09.691 --> 09:10.824
Maybe that'll clear it?

09:10.858 --> 09:12.559
That is a very good idea.

09:12.593 --> 09:13.627
You see, girls?

09:13.661 --> 09:14.821
We can handle this ourselves.

09:20.301 --> 09:21.201
Oh, my God.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.374
Um, I'll call a plumber.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.217
Dude.

09:37.251 --> 09:40.253
You and Sutton Mercer
back together again, huh?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.289
Look, I might've seen her when
I dropped you at the cabin.

09:42.323 --> 09:43.483
I mean, that girl moves fast.

09:43.491 --> 09:44.992
Nothing happened, okay?

09:45.026 --> 09:46.126
No, like literally fast.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.260
Like The Flash.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.996
You know, she was at the party one minute,

09:49.030 --> 09:50.130
then the cabin the next.

09:50.164 --> 09:52.366
She must've taken a shortcut.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.936
So, she races down there
for a secret rendezvous,

09:55.970 --> 09:57.337
and you guys don't even hook up?

09:57.372 --> 09:59.339
Come on, you don't really expect
me to believe that, do you?

09:59.374 --> 10:01.141
Jordan, you need to keep your mouth shut.

10:01.175 --> 10:02.976
All right?

10:03.011 --> 10:04.077
You didn't see anything.

10:04.112 --> 10:05.078
Got it?

10:05.113 --> 10:07.080
Got it.

10:07.115 --> 10:10.851
She wasn't there.

10:10.885 --> 10:13.787
And she's definitely
not down the hall either.

10:21.796 --> 10:22.996
Ladies.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.502
He was totally checking you out.

10:28.536 --> 10:29.903
Ew, he's my stepbrother.

10:29.937 --> 10:31.538
Regardless, you have to tell Laurel

10:31.572 --> 10:32.606
that you hooked up with him.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.740
You heard her this morning.

10:33.775 --> 10:35.509
She was talking about asking him out.

10:35.543 --> 10:37.411
It was a meaningless one-time thing,

10:37.445 --> 10:39.479
and we've agreed never
to speak about it again.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.547
It's like it didn't even happen.

10:40.581 --> 10:42.349
But it did happen.

10:42.383 --> 10:44.551
I'm late for Bio.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.191
Cleaning out?

10:51.225 --> 10:53.193
Dropping out, actually.

10:53.227 --> 10:56.196
Beattie found out I plagiarized
that World Civ paper.

10:56.230 --> 10:59.032
So, now I'm history.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.868
Not that it's any your business.

11:01.903 --> 11:03.036
Well, won't you go back to juvie.

11:03.071 --> 11:04.838
Well, maybe that's where I belong.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.908
No, Ethan, there has to
be something you can do.

11:07.942 --> 11:09.509
Yeah, there's a test I'd have

11:09.544 --> 11:12.546
to pass tomorrow on
all the course material,

11:12.580 --> 11:14.648
but I can't do that
because I'm too far behind,

11:14.682 --> 11:16.322
which is why I cheated in the first place.

11:17.652 --> 11:18.852
Wait.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.554
What?

11:20.588 --> 11:22.756
I'll tutor you.

11:24.759 --> 11:25.759
Why do you even care?

11:25.793 --> 11:28.228
After everything I did.

11:28.262 --> 11:29.463
Aren't you with Thayer now?

11:29.497 --> 11:31.565
Oh, come on. This has
nothing to do with him.

11:31.599 --> 11:33.366
This is about your future.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.534
You can't just give up.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.304
Please, just let me help you.

11:50.434 --> 11:52.969
Whoa, oops.

11:54.272 --> 11:56.973
Excuse me.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.308
Let me help.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.377
Oh, my gosh, I'm such a klutz.

12:00.411 --> 12:02.879
Maybe they should put warning
labels on these things.

12:02.913 --> 12:04.281
You're hilarious.

12:04.315 --> 12:05.949
Um, hey, look,

12:05.983 --> 12:08.885
I know this is really short notice, um,

12:08.919 --> 12:11.721
but DJ Beat Baron is
spinning tonight at Hangar 19.

12:11.756 --> 12:13.957
And I was thinking of going.

12:13.991 --> 12:15.725
Would you want to come?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.827
I didn't even know that
Beat Baron was in town.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.596
His mixes are so sick.

12:19.630 --> 12:20.930
So, you in?

12:20.965 --> 12:22.799
Yeah, for sure.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.801
Um, pick up around 7:00?

12:24.835 --> 12:25.902
It's a date.

12:25.936 --> 12:27.637
I mean, a date in the calendar

12:27.672 --> 12:29.673
sense of the word. Right.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.674
All right, I'll see you then.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.641
Okay.

12:33.344 --> 12:35.512
Woo.

12:37.448 --> 12:39.683
Mads, I thought you said
you wanted to apologize.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.718
I am apologizing.

12:41.752 --> 12:44.287
For last night, but not
for thinking Dad's innocent.

12:44.322 --> 12:45.288
I told you, he said...

12:45.323 --> 12:46.523
I don't care what he said.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.059
He's playing you just
like he plays everyone.

12:49.093 --> 12:51.394
Guys?

12:51.429 --> 12:53.129
Everything okay?

12:53.164 --> 12:54.297
Yeah, fine.

12:54.332 --> 12:55.932
No, it's not fine.

12:55.966 --> 12:58.001
Rebecca, tell him about the fingerprint

12:58.035 --> 12:59.169
they found on the golf bag.

12:59.203 --> 13:00.837
They can prove that Dad's been set up,

13:00.871 --> 13:02.138
just like he's been saying all along.

13:02.173 --> 13:04.708
Well, I didn't want to
get anybody's hopes up,

13:04.742 --> 13:07.744
but things are looking a lot better now.

13:07.778 --> 13:09.879
Well, I wouldn't pop
that champagne just yet.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.681
Excuse me, guys. I have work to do.

13:11.716 --> 13:13.416
Wait. We weren't finished talking.

13:13.451 --> 13:14.551
Thayer, stay.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.752
Why don't we all go to dinner together?

13:15.786 --> 13:17.354
My treat.

13:17.388 --> 13:18.488
Sutton and I are playing tennis tonight.

13:18.522 --> 13:21.257
She has regionals coming up. Sorry.

13:23.361 --> 13:24.594
He just won't listen.

13:24.628 --> 13:26.229
Oh, he'll come around.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.331
Mads, it's you

13:28.366 --> 13:30.266
that I'm actually worried about.

13:30.301 --> 13:32.268
Between all of this,
your dad being in jail,

13:32.303 --> 13:35.138
living at the Mercers while
they're going through divorce.

13:35.172 --> 13:37.273
Well, Ted and Kristin are
actually in therapy now.

13:37.308 --> 13:38.908
So, things seem better.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.076
Really?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.811
Yeah.

13:41.846 --> 13:43.947
That's so good to hear.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.652
Oh, good, you made it.

13:49.687 --> 13:50.987
I didn't think you would get here so...

13:51.021 --> 13:52.789
Wait a second.

13:52.823 --> 13:55.859
I told the girls
specifically not to call you.

13:55.893 --> 13:57.761
Really? 'Cause Laurel made it sound

13:57.795 --> 13:59.596
like you were practically
begging me to come over.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.631
Did they clog the drain too?

14:01.665 --> 14:03.400
Wouldn't put it past them... our girls.

14:03.434 --> 14:04.667
Pretty crafty.

14:04.702 --> 14:06.469
Aww, what is this?

14:06.504 --> 14:08.505
Lamb chops, some kind of fish, chicken.

14:08.539 --> 14:09.506
What are you thinking, piccata?

14:09.540 --> 14:11.474
Parmigiana.

14:11.509 --> 14:13.443
Mmm.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.012
Kill for a home-cooked meal,
not that I'm hinting at anything.

14:16.046 --> 14:17.280
Don't you think it's a
little early for that?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.182
Right.

14:19.216 --> 14:21.050
Speaking of which, I spoke
to Dr. Sandy's office.

14:21.085 --> 14:23.920
She said she has a time
for us Monday at 10:00?

14:23.954 --> 14:26.189
I actually have another
appointment at that time.

14:26.223 --> 14:28.024
And I'm not...

14:28.058 --> 14:29.893
I'm not sure that I
want to cancel it, so...

14:29.927 --> 14:31.027
No pressure, that's fine.

14:31.061 --> 14:32.996
Just let me know.

14:33.030 --> 14:33.843
I have to rent a rooter for this,

14:33.844 --> 14:36.533
- so can you wait till tomorrow?
- Sure.

14:39.603 --> 14:41.604
The call to Jessica Whitman
was made from a burner cell,

14:41.639 --> 14:43.540
so chances are it's been destroyed by now.

14:43.574 --> 14:46.743
In other words, anyone could've
called her, including Alec.

14:46.777 --> 14:48.278
Which is why I called his secretary

14:48.312 --> 14:50.280
to check his schedule that day.

14:50.314 --> 14:52.449
And from that look, I'm
guessing you found something.

14:52.483 --> 14:54.417
He took off early.

14:54.452 --> 14:57.487
Was gone all afternoon. Didn't say where.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.222
Huh, suspicious.

14:59.256 --> 15:01.157
Yeah, huh.

15:01.052 --> 15:03.119
I'm so sorry. I have to

15:03.154 --> 15:04.921
bail on you for tennis. Something came up.

15:04.955 --> 15:06.256
Well, whatever it is, it should wait

15:06.290 --> 15:09.059
because I found out who my dad
called with that cell phone.

15:10.961 --> 15:13.163
Apparently, he made one
call to a Jessica Whitman.

15:13.197 --> 15:15.765
Number's been disconnected, but
I figured we could work together

15:15.800 --> 15:16.933
and try and find her.

15:16.967 --> 15:19.803
I can't tonight.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.705
But...

15:21.739 --> 15:22.906
but you can do it without me.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.542
I'll call you later, okay?

15:27.845 --> 15:29.379
Wait, they're getting along now?

15:29.413 --> 15:30.714
I thought they hated each other.

15:30.748 --> 15:33.616
That was during the Seven Years' War.

15:33.651 --> 15:36.619
After World War I, France
and England were allies.

15:36.654 --> 15:38.421
Well, how am I supposed
to keep this stuff straight

15:38.456 --> 15:40.390
if even they can't decide who likes who?

15:40.424 --> 15:42.392
This is worse than high school.

15:42.426 --> 15:46.096
Maybe if you just focus
and put the ball down.

15:48.265 --> 15:49.199
I am focused.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.834
I really am.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.736
But I am focusing on how this is going

15:52.770 --> 15:54.738
to be a huge waste of my time.

15:54.772 --> 15:56.840
You're right.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.708
I can't teach you if
you don't want to learn.

15:58.743 --> 16:00.844
So have fun in juvie.

16:00.878 --> 16:04.547
All right, wait, wait.
Hang on a second, okay?

16:04.582 --> 16:07.884
I just feel like I don't deserve this.

16:07.918 --> 16:09.619
What?

16:09.653 --> 16:11.788
Your help.

16:15.326 --> 16:17.260
Okay.

16:17.294 --> 16:19.195
You made a mistake, Ethan.

16:19.230 --> 16:24.234
And now you have a chance to make it right.

16:24.268 --> 16:28.304
Ethan, I believe in you.

16:32.109 --> 16:34.844
Emma, I have to tell you something.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.148
I...

16:45.723 --> 16:49.459
Well, hope I'm not interrupting anything.

16:49.493 --> 16:50.760
Sutton, are you crazy?

16:50.795 --> 16:52.395
Oh, would you relax?

16:52.430 --> 16:53.563
I checked to make sure
Dan was still at work.

16:53.597 --> 16:58.234
I was stopping by to see if Ethan
wanted to join me for dinner,

16:58.269 --> 17:02.305
but, apparently, he has plans.

17:02.339 --> 17:03.406
It's not what you think, all right?

17:03.441 --> 17:05.108
I've... I've got a test tomorrow.

17:05.142 --> 17:06.509
We're... we're studying. She's helping me.

17:06.544 --> 17:09.244
Oh, well, that's really sweet.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.980
I approve.

17:11.015 --> 17:12.348
Seriously?

17:12.383 --> 17:13.916
Yes, seriously, we don't want lover boy

17:13.951 --> 17:16.252
to end up back in juvie now, do we?

17:16.287 --> 17:17.854
Lover boy?

17:17.887 --> 17:19.155
Oh, come on. It's a figure of speech.

17:19.190 --> 17:20.857
We really have a lot
of work to do right now.

17:20.891 --> 17:24.727
Okay, well, then I will leave you these.

17:24.762 --> 17:25.895
Just for a little snack.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.597
For later.

17:27.631 --> 17:28.832
It's from that favorite
barbeque place you like.

17:28.866 --> 17:32.435
Good luck tomorrow.

17:32.470 --> 17:33.770
He doesn't need luck.

17:35.473 --> 17:37.407
He has me.

17:42.688 --> 17:43.680
You should have seen her.

17:44.093 --> 17:45.827
Playing all innocent.

17:45.862 --> 17:48.664
I'm telling you that if
I would have stayed there,

17:48.698 --> 17:50.618
Alec wouldn't be the only
one in jail for murder.

17:50.633 --> 17:51.566
You're going to be a lot happier

17:51.601 --> 17:52.768
after you hear what I have to say.

17:52.802 --> 17:54.770
What could you possibly say
that would make me feel better?

17:54.804 --> 17:58.340
I want you...

17:58.374 --> 18:00.542
to take your life back from Emma.

18:00.576 --> 18:03.545
Since when is switching back
ever been part of the plan?

18:03.579 --> 18:05.414
It's just there's only so much I can do

18:05.448 --> 18:07.115
to keep Ted and Kristin apart.

18:07.150 --> 18:11.119
So, you want me to work from
the inside to split them up?

18:11.154 --> 18:13.221
Well, think about it this way:

18:13.256 --> 18:15.190
Emma will be here in isolation,

18:15.224 --> 18:17.259
while you're out and about,

18:17.293 --> 18:20.028
which means you'll have
Ethan all to yourself.

18:20.063 --> 18:22.798
You know she's not going
to do this willingly

18:22.832 --> 18:25.667
Mmm, you're going to have to
find a way to persuade her.

18:25.702 --> 18:27.703
Don't let me down, pumpkin.

18:33.576 --> 18:34.843
Mads.

18:34.877 --> 18:36.511
Hi.

18:36.546 --> 18:38.347
Am I at the right house?

18:38.381 --> 18:40.349
Yeah, I'm just staying
here for a little bit.

18:40.383 --> 18:41.450
Come on in.

18:41.484 --> 18:43.652
Laurel, uh, should be ready in a minute.

18:43.686 --> 18:47.189
Sorry, I didn't realize you'd be here.

18:47.223 --> 18:48.323
Guess this is kind of awkward.

18:48.358 --> 18:50.325
Why would it be awkward?

18:50.360 --> 18:53.095
Gotcha.

18:53.129 --> 18:55.364
All set. Thanks for entertaining him.

18:55.398 --> 18:57.199
Yeah, not a problem. You two have fun.

18:57.233 --> 18:59.334
Hey, do you want to come?

18:59.369 --> 19:00.335
Uh, I can't.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.037
I don't want to impose.

19:02.071 --> 19:03.939
Are you kidding? We're just hanging out.

19:03.973 --> 19:05.907
Mm-hmm.

19:05.942 --> 19:06.942
But I thought...

19:06.976 --> 19:08.744
No, you should come.

19:08.778 --> 19:10.946
It's not like it's a date or anything.

19:12.782 --> 19:16.651
Jordan, can you give us a sec?

19:16.686 --> 19:17.919
Okay, now you have to come with us.

19:17.954 --> 19:19.988
No, I'm so not in the mood.

19:20.023 --> 19:21.656
You were the one who
told me to ask him out,

19:21.691 --> 19:23.625
and now I'm totally confused.

19:23.659 --> 19:25.560
If you come along, you
can help me figure out

19:25.595 --> 19:26.895
whether or not he's really into me or not.

19:28.831 --> 19:29.831
Please?

19:32.668 --> 19:33.769
Fine.

19:33.803 --> 19:35.604
- For the record...
- Let's roll.

19:40.443 --> 19:41.410
Not a word.

19:44.647 --> 19:47.416
You left work early the day

19:47.450 --> 19:49.251
that call to Jessica Whitman was made.

19:49.285 --> 19:51.186
The only thing I'm guilty of is

19:51.220 --> 19:53.221
leaving work early to play some golf.

19:53.256 --> 19:55.090
And before you say anything,

19:55.124 --> 19:57.125
you're not allowed to have cell
phones on the golf course, okay?

19:57.160 --> 19:58.193
We should get out next week.

19:58.227 --> 19:59.394
What do you say? You free?

19:59.429 --> 20:02.197
She is. You aren't.

20:02.231 --> 20:04.966
Oh, think again, Danny Boy.

20:05.001 --> 20:06.935
I've got a witness that'll back me up.

20:06.969 --> 20:12.007
You two just gave me a
get-out-of-jail-free card.

20:23.626 --> 20:24.559
Hey, sis.

20:24.594 --> 20:25.894
You were out late.

20:25.928 --> 20:28.530
Oh, you scared the crap out of me, Sutton.

20:28.564 --> 20:29.631
Hey, you know, you should really get

20:29.665 --> 20:30.632
these re-strung every now and then.

20:30.666 --> 20:31.633
What do you think you're doing?

20:31.667 --> 20:33.402
You can't go play tennis.

20:33.436 --> 20:35.203
You're supposed to be staying out of sight.

20:35.238 --> 20:36.571
And you're supposed to be
practicing for regionals,

20:36.606 --> 20:38.473
but that doesn't seem to stop you

20:38.508 --> 20:41.043
from going over to
Ethan's and tutoring him.

20:41.077 --> 20:43.345
I knew you were upset about that.

20:43.379 --> 20:45.047
Oh, I'm not upset.

20:45.081 --> 20:46.281
I'm thrilled that you're helping him.

20:46.315 --> 20:47.949
Mm-hmm.

20:47.984 --> 20:49.751
I just don't want to lose regionals either.

20:49.786 --> 20:50.719
You know, a lot is riding on it:

20:50.753 --> 20:51.987
a chance to play D-1 tennis,

20:52.021 --> 20:53.789
and scholarship.

20:53.823 --> 20:55.090
Since when has any of that mattered to you?

20:55.124 --> 20:56.958
Since I had a lot of time
to think up at that cabin.

20:56.993 --> 20:58.760
And the fact of the matter
is, you and I are both going

20:58.795 --> 21:00.629
to have to go to college someday.

21:00.663 --> 21:03.565
Well, don't worry. I'm
ready for the tournament.

21:03.599 --> 21:05.467
And I'm gonna win the scholarship.

21:05.501 --> 21:09.438
Yeah, but a little bit
of practice wouldn't hurt.

21:09.472 --> 21:12.607
So, I was thinking, I can
just give you some pointers.

21:12.642 --> 21:13.708
We go out tomorrow.

21:13.743 --> 21:15.277
Just for fun.

21:15.311 --> 21:16.445
Someone will see us, Sutton.

21:16.479 --> 21:17.546
Then, we'll do it across town.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.114
No one will recognize us.

21:19.148 --> 21:21.149
What is the big deal?

21:21.184 --> 21:22.484
Why is this so important to you?

21:22.518 --> 21:25.320
Geez, just thought I'd spend

21:25.354 --> 21:26.421
some quality time with my sister,

21:26.456 --> 21:28.256
but if you're not interested.

21:28.291 --> 21:29.324
No.

21:31.194 --> 21:32.994
Actually, I would love to.

21:34.130 --> 21:36.698
You're on, sis.

21:36.732 --> 21:37.999
Thanks for coming down.

21:38.034 --> 21:39.901
Actually, I was already
planning on talking to you.

21:39.936 --> 21:41.603
About what?

21:41.637 --> 21:42.971
Well, you first. You said it was important.

21:43.005 --> 21:44.806
Well, we need you to make a statement.

21:44.841 --> 21:46.575
Some new evidence has come to light.

21:46.609 --> 21:47.809
Someone called a waitress at the club

21:47.844 --> 21:49.644
and paid her to plant the tire iron

21:49.679 --> 21:50.745
in your father's golf bag.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.481
- Wait. Somebody called?
- Yeah.

21:52.515 --> 21:54.716
What was the waitress's name?

21:54.750 --> 21:57.652
Jessica Whitman.

21:57.687 --> 22:00.655
Whoever called her set
your father up, Thayer.

22:00.690 --> 22:03.592
Oh, my God. Dan, he wasn't set up.

22:03.626 --> 22:06.595
He's the one who called.

22:06.629 --> 22:09.231
Hello, T.

22:09.265 --> 22:10.532
- What the hell?
- It's okay, Thayer.

22:10.566 --> 22:12.334
We just need to ask you some questions.

22:14.437 --> 22:16.037
Well, I've got some questions of my own.

22:16.072 --> 22:17.172
Like...

22:20.276 --> 22:22.144
how do you explain this, for example?

22:26.949 --> 22:27.983
Dad?

22:35.338 --> 22:36.850
How can you say you've
never seen that phone before?

22:36.851 --> 22:40.274
- I found it in our house.
- If it was there the whole time,

22:40.308 --> 22:42.309
why didn't the police find it
when the searched the house?

22:42.344 --> 22:44.211
They must have missed it.

22:44.245 --> 22:46.313
Come on. Look, whoever
planted the phone there,

22:46.348 --> 22:49.149
planted it there after the search.

22:49.184 --> 22:50.951
And then they called it

22:50.986 --> 22:52.720
to be sure you'd find it.

22:52.754 --> 22:54.054
Or maybe you just screwed up.

22:54.089 --> 22:56.790
And you didn't hide it as
well as you think you did.

22:56.825 --> 22:58.659
I'm no fool, son.

22:58.693 --> 22:59.693
- But you're a murderer.
- Okay,

22:59.728 --> 23:00.861
that's enough.

23:00.895 --> 23:01.929
This isn't getting us anywhere.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.530
I got the lab results.

23:03.565 --> 23:04.605
Our techs confirmed that...

23:04.633 --> 23:07.434
it is indeed the cell phone used

23:07.469 --> 23:08.736
to call Jessica Whitman.

23:08.770 --> 23:10.571
Ouch.

23:10.605 --> 23:11.672
Case closed.

23:11.706 --> 23:13.340
They also determined

23:13.375 --> 23:14.408
that the call to Jessica...

23:14.442 --> 23:17.211
was made from Flagstaff, Arizona.

23:18.513 --> 23:20.080
Weren't we playing golf the exact time

23:20.115 --> 23:22.282
that phone call was made?

23:22.317 --> 23:24.084
Yeah, it was a Friday, right?

23:24.119 --> 23:25.319
I remember it 'cause you beat me

23:25.353 --> 23:27.254
by one... you birdied 18.

23:27.288 --> 23:29.023
- I know. I remember.
- So how could I be

23:29.057 --> 23:30.824
playing golf with you in Scottsdale,

23:30.859 --> 23:31.859
and also be in Flagstaff,

23:31.893 --> 23:32.993
150 miles away?

23:33.028 --> 23:34.795
I don't know. Maybe you hired someone.

23:34.829 --> 23:37.631
Or maybe there's two of me.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.934
Well, it backfired.

23:40.969 --> 23:42.903
'Cause we got enough to go to the judge

23:42.937 --> 23:44.672
and get the charges against you dropped.

23:44.706 --> 23:46.707
Oh, my God. No, no, no, please, please,

23:46.741 --> 23:48.776
- you can't let him out.
- T, face it...

23:48.810 --> 23:50.344
You were wrong about everything,

23:50.378 --> 23:51.459
and the only mistake I made

23:51.479 --> 23:52.513
was taking your bastard ass in

23:52.547 --> 23:55.416
when nobody else gave a crap about you.

23:55.450 --> 23:56.550
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Okay, okay...

23:56.584 --> 23:58.218
Let's go. Let's go.

23:58.253 --> 23:59.520
Let's go.

24:02.424 --> 24:04.558
Damn it. This can't be happening right now.

24:04.592 --> 24:06.527
You dad's getting out
whether you like it or not.

24:06.561 --> 24:09.163
You need to find a way to deal with that.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.365
Now go home and cool off.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.971
Hi, this is Lindsey Ridgeway's office

24:18.006 --> 24:19.239
reminding you of your
appointment for Monday

24:19.274 --> 24:21.942
at 10:00 a.m. Please
call us back to confirm.

24:23.358 --> 24:26.426
You're still going to meet
with your divorce attorney?

24:26.461 --> 24:28.395
I don't know.

24:28.429 --> 24:30.330
Maybe.

24:30.365 --> 24:32.299
It turns out we have a therapy session

24:32.333 --> 24:36.203
the exact same time, so I do
have to cancel one of them.

24:36.237 --> 24:38.305
Do I get a vote on which one?

24:38.339 --> 24:40.207
Oh, I already know your
vote, thank you very much,

24:40.241 --> 24:42.242
and don't think I don't know
what you girls were up to

24:42.277 --> 24:43.917
with the whole plumbing thing. You are not

24:43.945 --> 24:45.813
as clever as you think you are.

24:45.847 --> 24:47.948
The point is, we would do anything

24:47.982 --> 24:49.650
to keep this family intact.

24:49.684 --> 24:51.652
And canceling on the divorce attorney

24:51.686 --> 24:53.587
is hardly going to extremes.

25:05.567 --> 25:08.702
I like this place.

25:08.736 --> 25:10.571
What do you think, Mads?

25:10.605 --> 25:13.574
I think there's too many people

25:13.608 --> 25:15.342
trying too hard to be cool,

25:15.376 --> 25:17.377
but I'm not surprised you like it.

25:17.412 --> 25:19.313
Excuse me?

25:19.347 --> 25:20.614
She's just kidding.

25:20.648 --> 25:22.282
You were just kidding, right?

25:22.317 --> 25:23.584
Yes, and you would know, Laurel,

25:23.618 --> 25:26.286
because you have an amazing sense of humor,

25:26.321 --> 25:27.354
an infectious laugh,

25:27.388 --> 25:29.256
great personality...

25:29.290 --> 25:32.392
- Stop.
- Some might say that she is the total package.

25:32.427 --> 25:34.194
Well, don't sell yourself short.

25:34.229 --> 25:36.997
Ugh. Well, thank you, stepbrother.

25:37.031 --> 25:38.098
I'm gonna go to the bar.

25:38.132 --> 25:39.199
Anyone want a drink?

25:39.234 --> 25:41.101
Sure. You want any help?

25:41.135 --> 25:44.004
No. You stay here with
Laurel. I'll get the drinks.

25:44.038 --> 25:46.673
- Well, at least let me buy.
- I really don't want your money.

25:46.708 --> 25:48.609
Hey, I'm sorry.

25:48.643 --> 25:49.877
Did I do something wrong?

25:49.911 --> 25:51.044
Ha! There she goes again.

25:51.079 --> 25:52.880
Hey, I'll just take a water.

25:52.914 --> 25:55.515
If that's cool.

25:55.550 --> 25:56.650
What're you gonna drink, Mads?

25:56.684 --> 25:57.885
A Cosmo? Sex on the beach?

25:57.919 --> 26:00.387
You know what? I'm gonna go home.

26:00.421 --> 26:02.489
He's all yours. You two enjoy your evening.

26:04.726 --> 26:06.460
Um, I'm really sorry.

26:06.494 --> 26:09.296
I have no idea what just happened.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.631
Forget about it.

26:10.665 --> 26:12.499
It's fine.

26:12.533 --> 26:14.234
Let's dance.

26:23.511 --> 26:25.312
Hey.

26:25.346 --> 26:27.014
- Hi.
- You playing today?

26:27.048 --> 26:29.182
No, I was just warming up.

26:29.217 --> 26:34.054
I'm actually headed across town
to have a match with Sutton.

26:34.088 --> 26:36.189
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm. It was her idea.

26:36.224 --> 26:39.026
I'm sure she has some
sort of ulterior motive.

26:39.060 --> 26:42.596
You guys are gonna just be alone together?

26:42.630 --> 26:44.531
Yes, we're gonna be alone together.

26:44.565 --> 26:46.800
I can't wait to hear
what she has on her mind.

26:47.568 --> 26:49.469
Hey...

26:49.504 --> 26:51.772
how did your test go?

26:51.806 --> 26:53.807
Uh, 73.

26:53.841 --> 26:55.475
I passed.

26:55.510 --> 26:59.479
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, well, I had a pretty good tutor.

26:59.514 --> 27:01.248
You think you might

27:01.282 --> 27:03.116
want to keep helping me with that stuff?

27:03.151 --> 27:04.484
So I can stay a free man.

27:07.088 --> 27:09.256
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.

27:09.290 --> 27:12.125
All right. Thanks.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.961
Come here.

27:13.995 --> 27:15.996
I'm so happy for you.

27:16.030 --> 27:17.998
Hey...

27:19.067 --> 27:20.834
what's going on here?

27:20.868 --> 27:23.737
Um, I was just thanking her for helping me.

27:23.771 --> 27:25.739
Uh, she tutored me.

27:25.773 --> 27:27.007
Tutoring you?

27:27.041 --> 27:28.775
Yeah. I thought you knew.

27:28.810 --> 27:30.644
Uh, no, actually.

27:30.678 --> 27:32.579
Wait, hold on. So last night...

27:32.613 --> 27:33.814
that's where you had to go?

27:33.848 --> 27:36.583
The test was today.

27:36.617 --> 27:38.585
Wow.

27:38.619 --> 27:42.255
You know what? It doesn't matter.

27:42.290 --> 27:43.423
Thayer...

27:49.362 --> 27:50.380
Alec is getting out?

27:50.810 --> 27:52.508
The judge is signing off on it now.

27:52.966 --> 27:54.600
It's obvious that he was framed.

27:54.634 --> 27:56.902
Of course. By whom?

27:56.936 --> 27:59.905
Well, the call to the waitress
came from Flagstaff, Arizona.

27:59.939 --> 28:02.441
Does that mean anything to you?

28:02.475 --> 28:04.543
Flagstaff, uh, no.

28:04.577 --> 28:06.512
Not at all.

28:06.546 --> 28:09.281
Anyway, he should be out by this evening.

28:09.315 --> 28:10.582
You two should celebrate.

28:10.617 --> 28:13.385
Yes, I thought this day would never come.

28:13.420 --> 28:16.121
Thank you so much, Theresa.

28:19.359 --> 28:22.394
Hey, Ted, I just got

28:22.429 --> 28:25.064
- the most amazing news.
- Really? What?

28:25.098 --> 28:26.999
Alec's being released.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.133
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:28.168 --> 28:29.835
Wow. That...

28:29.869 --> 28:31.136
I didn't expect that.

28:31.171 --> 28:33.972
Neither was I.

28:34.007 --> 28:36.608
Actually.

28:38.611 --> 28:40.813
Well why are you so upset?

28:42.849 --> 28:46.385
I'm scared, Ted.

28:46.419 --> 28:48.654
It's just whenever I've gone to see

28:48.688 --> 28:51.590
Alec in jail, I've gotten the feeling

28:51.624 --> 28:54.660
that he might blame me for his arrest.

28:54.694 --> 28:56.228
Well, that's ridiculous.

28:56.262 --> 28:57.463
You've been more supportive than anyone.

28:57.497 --> 28:59.198
Yeah, well...

28:59.232 --> 29:01.133
you know how he gets.

29:01.167 --> 29:03.035
His temper.

29:03.069 --> 29:05.204
Well, if you are that afraid,

29:05.238 --> 29:07.139
why don't you leave town?

29:07.173 --> 29:09.108
Go back to L.A.?

29:09.142 --> 29:11.910
You don't really mean that?

29:13.813 --> 29:15.080
I thought that...

29:15.115 --> 29:16.882
You thought wrong.

29:16.916 --> 29:19.818
I see.

29:19.853 --> 29:22.755
Well, I can't...

29:22.789 --> 29:24.757
run away, not again.

29:24.791 --> 29:26.458
I mean, everything I love is here.

29:26.493 --> 29:27.760
My roots are here.

29:27.794 --> 29:30.596
My family is here.

29:30.630 --> 29:33.499
You mean Jordan?

29:33.533 --> 29:35.434
Who else would I mean?

29:35.468 --> 29:37.603
Well, I'm, I'm sorry.

29:37.637 --> 29:40.339
I shouldn't have fallen
apart on you like this.

29:40.373 --> 29:42.441
And I thank you for being there for me.

29:53.987 --> 29:57.089
Thayer, hi. It's Emma again.

29:57.123 --> 29:58.957
Are you okay?

29:58.992 --> 30:00.726
Please call me back.

30:02.762 --> 30:04.062
Trouble in paradise?

30:04.097 --> 30:05.964
Are you sure nobody's
gonna recognize us here?

30:05.999 --> 30:07.120
Please, anyone worth knowing

30:07.133 --> 30:08.767
wouldn't be caught dead here.

30:08.802 --> 30:09.868
All right.

30:09.903 --> 30:12.671
You serve.

30:12.705 --> 30:14.840
I'm sure you haven't played in a while.

30:14.874 --> 30:17.876
Always so considerate, Emma.

30:17.911 --> 30:20.712
Well, care to make things interesting?

30:20.747 --> 30:22.447
Well, what did you have in mind?

30:22.482 --> 30:23.515
Well, whoever wins

30:23.550 --> 30:25.250
is obviously the best player,

30:25.285 --> 30:27.686
so she should be the one
that plays at regionals.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.255
So that's what this is about.

30:30.290 --> 30:31.590
You want to switch back.

30:31.624 --> 30:33.525
For a few days. Just for regionals.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.260
Unless, of course,
you're too scared, then...

30:35.295 --> 30:37.095
you don't have to.

30:37.130 --> 30:39.231
Oh, I'm not scared. You should be scared,

30:39.265 --> 30:42.000
'cause I will wipe these courts with you.

30:42.035 --> 30:44.369
Feisty, Emma.

30:44.404 --> 30:47.105
Fine. We have a deal?

30:47.140 --> 30:49.975
No, actually, I have some of my own terms.

30:50.009 --> 30:51.009
Whoever loses...

30:51.044 --> 30:53.078
has to stay in the cabin.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.947
For real this time.

30:54.981 --> 30:57.049
Can't step foot out of it. Understand?

31:00.553 --> 31:03.488
Good luck.

31:03.523 --> 31:04.790
May the best sister win.

31:04.824 --> 31:06.692
Oh, I will.

31:06.726 --> 31:08.560
Oh, hey.

31:08.595 --> 31:11.597
I wanted to apologize
for last night. I, um,

31:11.631 --> 31:13.599
- I guess I kind of screwed things up.
- Oh, no.

31:13.633 --> 31:15.701
Leaving was the best
thing you could've done.

31:15.735 --> 31:17.502
I never should've asked you to come along.

31:17.537 --> 31:20.405
Oh, so things worked
out with you and Jordan?

31:20.440 --> 31:22.441
We danced for a while and
talked for, like, hours

31:22.475 --> 31:25.177
about music and bands and life.

31:25.211 --> 31:27.980
He's so sweet and cute.

31:28.014 --> 31:30.182
I think we're gonna go out again next week.

31:30.216 --> 31:33.118
Awesome. Well, I'm really happy for you.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.219
Me, too.

31:34.254 --> 31:35.888
You're the best.

31:39.826 --> 31:42.794
Hey, Thayer. What's up?

31:45.665 --> 31:47.633
What?

31:56.442 --> 31:58.477
That's me on the first set. 6-2.

31:58.511 --> 32:00.379
You're on fire.

32:00.413 --> 32:01.480
Well,

32:01.514 --> 32:02.748
we can quit if you want.

32:02.782 --> 32:06.418
No, no. I'm just a little off.

32:06.452 --> 32:08.587
Haven't really been getting
much sleep this week.

32:08.621 --> 32:10.322
That's 'cause you're running around town

32:10.356 --> 32:12.224
when you should be up at
that cabin just relaxing.

32:12.258 --> 32:13.492
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to relax

32:13.526 --> 32:15.494
when Ethan just drops by
in the middle of the night.

32:15.528 --> 32:17.362
Excuse me.

32:17.397 --> 32:20.232
Oh...

32:20.266 --> 32:23.268
after Jordan's party, he stopped by,

32:23.303 --> 32:26.038
and you said it was
fine, so I slept with him.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.000
You're cool with that, right?

32:30.043 --> 32:31.810
Yeah, whatever. He can...

32:31.844 --> 32:33.946
he can do what he wants.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.848
Good, 'cause I totally thought
you'd be, like, really upset.

32:37.850 --> 32:38.884
I'm not.

32:38.918 --> 32:41.486
Obviously.

32:41.521 --> 32:43.355
My serve.

32:58.371 --> 32:59.604
Hey.

32:59.639 --> 33:03.175
The, um, the cam, um...

33:04.277 --> 33:05.277
Chain tensioner.

33:05.311 --> 33:06.278
Yeah, that's the one.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.281
Do you mind taking a look at it?

33:09.315 --> 33:11.116
All right.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.220
Sutton's not here, is she?

33:15.254 --> 33:18.123
Why would she be?

33:18.157 --> 33:19.858
Just asking.

33:19.892 --> 33:22.928
Never seem to know where
she's gonna pop up next.

33:22.962 --> 33:24.830
It didn't sound like
your tensioner, but, um,

33:24.864 --> 33:26.765
we're probably gonna check
your plugs out, all right?

33:26.799 --> 33:29.634
What's the deal with you guys anyways?

33:31.771 --> 33:34.940
Look, it's, uh... it's complicated.

33:34.974 --> 33:37.843
Okay, she used to be one person and...

33:37.877 --> 33:40.545
now she's someone else.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.781
And you don't know which one you like more.

33:42.815 --> 33:45.717
- Something like that, yeah.
- Chicks.

33:45.752 --> 33:48.387
Even when you know they're
completely wrong for you,

33:48.421 --> 33:50.522
you still can't stop thinking about them.

33:50.556 --> 33:53.125
Sounds to me like you're
the one with the problem.

33:53.159 --> 33:54.426
Yeah, tell me about it.

33:54.460 --> 33:56.428
But hey, I did see Sutton at the cabin.

33:56.462 --> 33:57.996
She's into you, man.

33:58.031 --> 33:59.064
Like, hardcore into you.

33:59.098 --> 34:00.232
If I were you,

34:00.266 --> 34:01.900
I wouldn't overthink it.

34:01.934 --> 34:04.036
If I were you,

34:04.070 --> 34:05.971
I wouldn't either.

34:38.838 --> 34:40.572
Emma!

34:41.641 --> 34:42.641
Mads?

34:42.675 --> 34:43.708
Time-out.

34:43.743 --> 34:44.824
Thank God I found you.

34:44.844 --> 34:46.610
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:46.646 --> 34:47.712
What's the matter?

34:47.746 --> 34:49.781
Thayer just called to say good-bye.

34:49.815 --> 34:51.382
He's moving back to L.A.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.317
I guess things got pretty ugly

34:52.351 --> 34:53.585
between him and my dad.

34:53.619 --> 34:56.621
Oh, I knew something was wrong with him.

34:56.656 --> 34:59.458
Uh-oh. Drama.

34:59.492 --> 35:00.492
I really wanted to make peace between them,

35:00.526 --> 35:01.493
but he won't listen to me,

35:01.527 --> 35:03.061
and Emma, I think you might be

35:03.096 --> 35:04.362
the only person who can keep him here.

35:04.397 --> 35:05.430
And you've got to hurry

35:05.465 --> 35:06.965
'cause he's packing right now.

35:08.067 --> 35:09.334
Tick-tock.

35:11.137 --> 35:12.938
Congratulations, Sutton.

35:12.972 --> 35:14.739
You win. I forfeit.

35:35.894 --> 35:37.027
Thayer.

35:38.129 --> 35:39.863
You shouldn't have come, Emma.

35:39.898 --> 35:41.799
I don't understand.

35:41.833 --> 35:42.933
What happened with Alec?

35:42.967 --> 35:44.968
He won, like he always does.

35:45.003 --> 35:46.904
He's getting out of jail,
so I can't stay here anymore.

35:46.938 --> 35:48.739
What, he's getting out?

35:48.773 --> 35:49.773
How?

35:49.808 --> 35:51.742
That phone I found exonerated him.

35:51.776 --> 35:52.843
Can you believe that?

35:52.877 --> 35:54.778
Okay...

35:54.813 --> 35:56.480
well, you don't have to leave.

35:56.514 --> 35:57.881
I mean, you could stay someplace else.

35:57.916 --> 35:59.817
Emma, I don't really live here.

35:59.851 --> 36:01.618
I only came back to help you and Sutton,

36:01.653 --> 36:03.420
but every single time I do, it always leads

36:03.455 --> 36:06.390
back to my father, and I
can't, I can't beat him.

36:09.594 --> 36:12.596
It's killing me.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.299
I'm sorry.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.414
You know what, the truth is,

36:16.434 --> 36:19.136
there is nothing left for me here anymore.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.108
What about me?

36:24.142 --> 36:27.911
I'm... I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Ethan, but...

36:27.946 --> 36:29.012
It's not about that.

36:33.051 --> 36:34.952
I want you to come with me.

36:38.890 --> 36:42.793
Uh... uh... Thayer, I can't do that.

36:42.827 --> 36:45.629
The Mercers are the only
family I've ever known.

36:45.663 --> 36:47.798
I can't leave them right now.

36:49.634 --> 36:51.401
Well, I can't...

36:51.436 --> 36:53.303
I can't stay either.

36:54.472 --> 36:57.341
So then that's it?

36:59.344 --> 37:01.145
Maybe it's for the best.

37:01.179 --> 37:04.882
No, I... I...

37:20.532 --> 37:22.766
Take care of yourself.

37:43.121 --> 37:45.155
See? Good as new.

37:45.190 --> 37:47.391
Guess I'll just get out of your way.

37:49.093 --> 37:51.862
Ted, about that counseling
session on Monday.

37:51.896 --> 37:53.897
I'll be there.

37:53.932 --> 37:55.265
What about your other appointment?

37:57.235 --> 37:59.002
I canceled it.

38:00.872 --> 38:02.139
That's good to hear,

38:02.173 --> 38:03.933
but I hope you brought
your checkbook, ma'am,

38:03.942 --> 38:06.743
'cause you've rung up
quite a hefty plumbing bill.

38:09.547 --> 38:11.481
Chicken parmigiana?

38:11.516 --> 38:12.549
Leftovers.

38:12.584 --> 38:14.418
Looks like everything is getting

38:14.452 --> 38:17.421
back to normal around here.

38:17.455 --> 38:19.723
Yes, your father fixed the drain.

38:19.757 --> 38:23.427
I wasn't talking about the plumbing.

38:36.140 --> 38:37.374
Do you want me to get Laurel?

38:37.408 --> 38:39.088
You know, honestly, I can't figure you out.

38:39.110 --> 38:40.911
One minute, you're hot; the
next minute, you're cold.

38:40.945 --> 38:42.012
Do you even know what you want?

38:42.046 --> 38:45.148
What about you? You're
practically stalking me.

38:45.183 --> 38:46.850
I am not interested, okay?

38:46.885 --> 38:48.018
Oh, is that right?

38:48.052 --> 38:49.019
Yeah.

39:23.154 --> 39:26.356
Well, I love the smell
of freedom in the evening.

39:26.391 --> 39:27.357
The press is at the other entrance,

39:27.392 --> 39:28.425
just like you requested.

39:28.459 --> 39:30.260
Perfect.

39:30.295 --> 39:32.129
There'll be plenty of time
for grandstanding later.

39:32.163 --> 39:33.997
Do you need a lift home?

39:34.032 --> 39:36.033
No.

39:36.067 --> 39:38.335
I've got a stop to make.

39:43.141 --> 39:45.842
Tell my wife I'm coming for her.

39:50.915 --> 39:53.016
You were in Flagstaff?

39:53.051 --> 39:55.018
You were supposed to make
that call from the golf course

39:55.053 --> 39:57.554
so no one would question it.

39:57.588 --> 39:59.489
No, I don't want you to do anything.

39:59.524 --> 40:01.758
Alec will be here any minute.

40:02.860 --> 40:05.729
I know exactly how to handle him.

40:24.115 --> 40:26.950
Hey, baby, I'm home.

40:28.019 --> 40:31.121
Darling, I've missed you so much.

40:37.895 --> 40:39.963
I'll bet.

41:13.531 --> 41:16.133
God, you scare easily.

41:16.167 --> 41:18.168
Well, what do you expect?
There's a murderer out there.

41:18.202 --> 41:22.039
Hey, so, I'm really sorry
about the Thayer thing.

41:22.073 --> 41:24.074
Tough break, but a deal's a deal.

41:24.108 --> 41:27.411
And if you remember, not one
foot outside of the cabin.

41:27.445 --> 41:29.246
Your terms, I recall.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.914
And what if I refuse?

41:30.948 --> 41:32.949
You wouldn't dare.

41:32.984 --> 41:34.184
Try me.

41:34.218 --> 41:37.854
Shoot. I was afraid this would happen.

41:37.889 --> 41:40.957
See, I'm not going to go either, so...

41:40.992 --> 41:44.928
I think we're gonna just have to
tell the family our big secret,

41:44.962 --> 41:46.863
which is going to be really
tough because Kristin,

41:46.898 --> 41:48.131
I don't really know how
she's going to react.

41:48.166 --> 41:51.201
She's very fragile right now.

41:51.235 --> 41:53.136
You're bluffing.

41:53.171 --> 41:55.105
Try me.

41:59.977 --> 42:01.111
Fine.

42:01.145 --> 42:02.946
I'm leaving,

42:02.980 --> 42:04.881
but Ted and Kristin are
making really good progress,

42:04.916 --> 42:06.283
so just promise me that
you'll keep pushing them

42:06.317 --> 42:08.118
in the right direction.

42:08.152 --> 42:11.221
Yes! Of course! They're my parents.

42:11.255 --> 42:13.090
You think I don't want them together?

42:13.124 --> 42:15.092
All right, I'll see you in a couple days.

42:15.126 --> 42:17.027
I left some clean towels
for you at the cabin.

42:18.096 --> 42:19.262
You may need them.

42:20.832 --> 42:22.132
See,

42:22.166 --> 42:23.867
I can be considerate too, Emma.

42:25.303 --> 42:27.037
Good luck at regionals.

42:27.071 --> 42:28.872
I don't need luck.
