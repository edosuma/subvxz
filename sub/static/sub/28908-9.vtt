WEBVTT

00:11.594 --> 00:13.179
Man, it's so good to be back.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.848
You know, the strike was worth it.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.474
We got most of what we were asking for.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.352
But not everything.
We didn't get 10:00 a.m. start time.

00:19.644 --> 00:21.479
You were the only one asking for that.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.816
You know, a strike is like a colonoscopy.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.443
Can I take your word for it?

00:26.818 --> 00:27.902
With a colonoscopy--

00:28.111 --> 00:29.696
Nope, he's off and running.

00:30.196 --> 00:33.491
See, it's unpleasant while it's happening,
but when it's over,

00:33.575 --> 00:35.326
you know you did the right thing.

00:37.078 --> 00:40.040
Well, thank God it's over...
the strike and that analogy.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.624
Hey, good morning, Abby.

00:41.916 --> 00:42.959
Hey, guys.

00:43.126 --> 00:47.005
Isn't it great to be back with our kids?
I got a standing ovation.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.715
That's awesome.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.633
Tony's kids didn't even notice
he was gone.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.594
Not true.

00:52.677 --> 00:55.472
I know because they were clearly upset
when I came back.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.724
Well, I'm glad it was only a week.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.934
Gotta go organize
the student college tours.

01:00.018 --> 01:03.104
Whitney Carson
from my honors class is ready to roll.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.273
Her itinerary is laminated.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.027
Big deal, so is my Chipotle card.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.863
-Good morning, gang.
-Hey.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.282
Paula and I had a little girls' night
last night.

01:14.616 --> 01:18.328
She continues to generously enlighten me
in the ways of the world.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.706
I don't know how much I enlightened you.

01:21.915 --> 01:26.544
Every time guys would try to holler at us,
you'd start talking about your ex, Danny.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.587
Is that bad?

01:27.670 --> 01:28.505
It's not good.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.216
It's up there
with "I'm saving myself for marriage"

01:31.299 --> 01:32.592
and "my kids are gonna love you."

01:34.511 --> 01:37.388
Danny, the college football star.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.058
Danny, the rescue-dog adopter.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.393
Danny, who pays his taxes.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.565
Every time the men would go
to get our drinks, they'd never return.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.485
They went to go find Danny.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.906
College football star?
Is there even a college in South Dakota?

01:55.824 --> 01:58.409
And rescue dog just means
he got a free dog.

02:00.537 --> 02:05.208
As long as you keep fixating on Danny,
no man will ever measure up.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.545
[laughs]

02:09.087 --> 02:10.338
Ah, who am I kidding?

02:10.421 --> 02:12.090
I saw that sext message.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.509
No man will ever measure up.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.054
You know, the iPhone distorts images,

02:18.471 --> 02:19.806
especially if you zoom.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.351
Zoom?
You could see that thing from outer space!

02:25.603 --> 02:27.897
But it's about the motion
in the ocean, right?

02:28.648 --> 02:30.358
Sure, skipper, keep telling yourself that.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.571
Hey, Abby, I thought you were over Danny.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.198
Yeah, haven't we all moved on?
I know I have.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.993
-Morning, sports fans.
-Hey, Coach.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.997
I think I could move on if Danny
stopped sending me flowers and poems

02:44.080 --> 02:45.331
and naming stars after me.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.208
All the stars should be named after you.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.919
Pump your brakes, Little Dipper.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.004
Hmm.

02:51.754 --> 02:52.922
Hey, Ms. Spencer,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.674
you got some man problems?

02:54.757 --> 02:56.426
I got some man solutions.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.097
Well, it's just that I'm ready to move on,
but Danny isn't.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.682
I'll call the jerk.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.269
Threaten to break his neck,
and he'll never bother you again, capiche?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.272
Oh, that is such a sweet offer,
Coach Dixon,

03:09.772 --> 03:11.566
but I think he just needs
a little more time.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.776
Well, let me know
when you wanna speed things up.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.029
Bingo and Bango are locked...
[inhales sharply]

03:18.156 --> 03:19.657
...and loaded. [laughs]

03:19.741 --> 03:22.869
Okay, toodles noodles.
See you in the soup.

03:22.952 --> 03:23.828
Okay.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.332
Hey, football season's been over
for a month now.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.334
Poor Coach is getting a little nutty.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.170
Yeah, he's proof
that they don't drug test here.

03:34.088 --> 03:34.923
Yeah.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.049
You know, actually,

03:36.132 --> 03:40.261
having a third party tell Danny
it's time to move on isn't a crazy idea.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.680
It's not? Well, name two crazier ones.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.725
Ice fishing
and the Gathering of the Juggalos.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.562
I'm sorry, bro, but hip-hop clowns
making it rain Faygo

03:49.646 --> 03:51.147
doesn't sound crazy to me.

03:51.814 --> 03:52.774
What's Faygo?

03:52.857 --> 03:54.400
That's white people Fanta.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.364
Gabe, you could convince anybody
of anything.

03:59.447 --> 04:03.076
You could sell sawdust to a lumber mill.
Will you please call Danny?

04:03.326 --> 04:04.369
[sighs]

04:04.535 --> 04:06.913
You know, calling a lumber mill
would be a lot less awkward

04:06.996 --> 04:09.374
than calling some guy I've never met
who cheated on my friend.

04:09.999 --> 04:10.875
[Tony] Come on, Gabe,

04:11.042 --> 04:12.502
you gotta help Abby move on.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.795
It's the right thing to do

04:14.170 --> 04:15.380
for all of us.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.384
Here's Danny's number.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.261
Thanks, Gaber.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.721
Toodles noodles.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.890
See you in the menudo.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.437
-So what are you gonna do?
-Well, I'm gonna call Danny.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.399
And if it doesn't work out,
I'm gonna give this to my sister.

if my parents buy 20 boxes,

can I have an empty seat next to me
on the plane?

05:03.636 --> 05:04.512
Hm.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.974
And can I visit whatever colleges
Whitney isn't visiting?

05:09.475 --> 05:12.687
Don't worry,
I'm not visiting any of my safety schools.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.402
My safety school
is Bunker Hill Community College.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.863
Nothing safer than a school in a bunker.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.698
Right?

05:23.781 --> 05:24.741
[scoffs]

05:26.159 --> 05:27.035
Yes, Lorenzo.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.911
Some of you will see community colleges,

05:28.995 --> 05:33.750
others will look at state schools
like UCLA, UC Irvine--

-I always wanted to go to UCLA.
-Mm-hmm?

05:36.711 --> 05:40.590

the toilet! Thanks, Chip Kelly!

05:42.925 --> 05:43.926
All right, Walt,

05:44.010 --> 05:45.678
I'm deputizing you.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.972
You're in charge
of logistics and planning.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.392
Oh, nope, that plan is not... logical.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.313
Come on, I got this.
Yo, who needs some sugar?

05:55.396 --> 05:56.773
I got that good nougat.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.026
Yo, I saw The Wire.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.654
You gotta give 'em a taste for free,
and then they'll buy the whole box.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.949
Yeah. You know,

06:07.033 --> 06:10.411
maybe it was a mistake inviting sophomores
to participate this year.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.122
Well, I've already decided
on my dream school:

06:13.206 --> 06:14.540
Long Beach State.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.419
I don't even need a tour. I drive by it
on the way home from two of my three jobs.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.838
Long Beach State sounds good to me.
[chuckles]

06:20.922 --> 06:23.800
But even I know, Long Beach?
[clicks tongue] Not a state.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.260
Mm-hmm.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.930
With your grades, Marisol,
you should aim higher.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.807
Think Berkeley, Stanford.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.643
I know you can handle a school
with that kind of rigor.

06:33.726 --> 06:34.769
What's "rigor" mean?

06:34.852 --> 06:38.022
It means you should be focusing
on junior colleges there, Mikey.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.861
Oh, my God, Gabe!

06:43.945 --> 06:45.905
Danny called me right after
you talked to him.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.990
You're a miracle worker!

06:48.199 --> 06:51.869
Hey. Just call me La Virgen de Guadalupe.

will tattoo me on his neck.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.836
What's a cholo?

07:00.670 --> 07:03.047
Remember when we went to the Dodger game?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.216
-Uh-huh.
-And, um,

07:05.299 --> 07:07.552
there was that one guy
with the hickeys and the girlfriend

-that kept hitting on you?
-Mm-hmm.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.930
Okay, the guy that beat him up.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.306
Oh!

07:13.724 --> 07:14.892
That's a cholo.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.229
I thought a cholo was a Mexican pastry.

-That's a churro.

07:22.900 --> 07:23.818
Those are awesome.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.071
Yeah, okay. Well, anyway.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.700
When I talked to Danny, he sounded
like a completely different person.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.537
Like he was ready to make a fresh start,
which means I can make a fresh start.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.416
Yeah, Abby, it's about time you moved on
from that mutant inbred piglet

07:38.499 --> 07:40.501
with cloven hooves from South Dakota.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.420
No offense.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.338
Yeah, "no offense" makes it all better.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.341

When Abby said you're probably
the greatest person she ever met,

08:15.286 --> 08:17.246
she did not do you justice, my man.

08:17.622 --> 08:21.584
Oh. Yeah, well, Abby never mentioned
what a great hugger you are. [chuckles]

08:22.460 --> 08:25.213
Is it weird that I wanted that to last
a little bit longer?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.799
You know, in the Bible,

08:28.883 --> 08:32.345
the archangel Gabriel
appeared to Daniel to explain his vision.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.722
I'm Daniel, you're Gabriel.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.391
And do you know who you are, Abby?

08:37.683 --> 08:38.809
The vision.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.230
Aww! [chuckles]

08:51.697 --> 08:53.449
Actually, this is Danny.

08:54.075 --> 08:54.951

09:00.540 --> 09:02.959
You still wanna introduce him
to Bingo and Bango?

09:04.627 --> 09:06.045
No, I do not.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.381
You never told me he was from Krypton.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.050
Coach out.

09:12.176 --> 09:15.096
You know, Danny,
when I said it was time to move on,

09:15.179 --> 09:18.140
you must've heard it was time to move on
to an airplane?

09:18.683 --> 09:21.352
[chuckles]
No, I heard what you were really saying:

09:21.686 --> 09:24.814
"Get your butt out to Long Beach
and make things right

09:24.897 --> 09:27.108
with the most perfect gal in the world."

09:27.900 --> 09:28.734
Huh.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.615
You know, something definitely
got lost in translation there.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.286
On the bright side, Abby, you are
no longer the tallest person in the room.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.333
[silently mouthing]

09:57.054 --> 09:58.389
How you doing, girl?

09:59.307 --> 10:00.433
I'm okay.

10:00.933 --> 10:05.021
Still a little surprised, angry,
happy to see him,

10:05.104 --> 10:08.232

10:08.316 --> 10:11.152

10:12.361 --> 10:14.530
Yeah, and who says women are complicated?

10:15.531 --> 10:16.616
So, what are you gonna do?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.910
Just feels like I have to break up
with him all over again.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.871
It's so much harder in person.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.082
When I look into his eyes... [sighs]
...I'm helpless.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.835
Hm. I haven't even made it up to his eyes.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.885
But I don't trust him.
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

of several rounds.

that eye thing.

-From the magazines?
-[Danny] Mm-hmm.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.849
Thanks, Danny!

11:25.017 --> 11:27.853
Hey, I put a maraschino cherry
in your ginger ale,

11:27.937 --> 11:29.730
Gabe. It's my favorite mocktail.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.359
You know, fun fact about mocktails
is the...

11:33.442 --> 11:36.320
the whole world is mocking you 
for being in recovery.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.616
And... a lemon drop for my lemon drop.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.327
Oh, boy, Danny.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.247
Shortcake, I messed up,

11:46.497 --> 11:49.417
and I will never stop being sorry
for hurting you, and...

11:49.875 --> 11:53.587
you can say anything you need to to me
and I will stand here and take it.

11:53.838 --> 11:58.592
Aw... You are so sweet...
and such a jerk.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.761
And so handsome,

12:00.845 --> 12:02.304
and so terrible.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.182
Mmm, Paula, I need the little girls' room.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.269
Okay, separate stalls.
We not there yet.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.029
Abby told me so much about you guys
and how much you helped her,

12:19.113 --> 12:20.948
that I come bearing gifts.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.659
[both] Presents!

12:23.743 --> 12:26.954
Now, Abby was telling me that you
love wrestling as much as I do?

12:27.037 --> 12:28.998
Only if you love it more than anything
in the world.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.625
Well, I love Abby
more than anything in the world.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.670
But wrestling is a close second.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.342
What? Oh, Stone Cold Steve Austin,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.094
The Rock, Ric Flair?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.012
Whoo!

12:44.472 --> 12:47.183
This is like the Holy Trinity.
Thank you, Danny.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.851
No, thank you, Gabe.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.729
And Tony,
I don't want you to think we left you out,

12:52.188 --> 12:53.856
but Abby left something out.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.316
Really? What?

12:55.399 --> 12:56.942
How handsome you are.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.570
-Oh!
-[Danny] I mean, look at you.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.156
You could cut diamonds
with those cheekbones.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.748
Anyway... Uh...

13:10.956 --> 13:13.459
-I heard you like games of chance?
-He sure does.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.086
He rolls the dice at last call
every night.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.590
Well, I got you some scratchers,
lotto tickets,

13:19.673 --> 13:21.217
and an NFL five team parlay.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.596
Nice! This killjoy tried to get me to go
to Gamblers Anonymous.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.389
[chuckles]

13:27.473 --> 13:29.642
Oh, you guys are like the brothers
I never had.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.352
And I had brothers.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.271
Ooh! Oh, Tony, you need a refill.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.608
Looks like Johnnie Walker
walked right into your tum-tum, huh?

13:37.691 --> 13:39.109
[chuckles]

13:39.693 --> 13:42.947
[in high-pitched voice] Tum-tum.
[in low voice] Tum-tum.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.784
I call BS. No dude is that nice.

13:46.867 --> 13:47.952
I'm that nice.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.037
Yeah, there's no way
there could be two of you.

13:50.913 --> 13:51.789
Hey, Katie.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.041
Do us a favor.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.502
We need to find out
if Danny's still a creep.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.796
The 40% tipper? Heh.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.589
I got no problem with him.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.926
Hey, just because you tip a lot
doesn't mean you're a good person.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.011
Hey, pump your brakes, Little Tipper.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.265
Fine, I got this.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.059
-Here, Tony.
-Ooh!

14:12.142 --> 14:15.479
You target these delts,
or is that all natural?

14:16.814 --> 14:17.690
Uh...

14:17.773 --> 14:20.401
I don't know how they do it in Long Beach,

14:20.484 --> 14:25.072
but that tip in no way 
was to suggest anything untoward.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.199
I love Abby.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.870
And yes, I have been known
to target these delts.

14:30.953 --> 14:31.829
[chuckles softly]

14:31.912 --> 14:34.164
Hey, back off, homewrecker. He's taken.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.125
Sucia.

14:40.087 --> 14:43.257
Oh, I bet Paula would like a fresh one
waiting for her

14:43.340 --> 14:45.050
-when she gets back, am I right?
-Oh.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.136
He really seems to get Paula.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.723
Gabe, Abby and I came up with a plan.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.225
And yes, we were in the same stall.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.604
You gotta convince Danny to go home.

14:56.687 --> 15:00.190
What? He just gave us presents,
and they're awesome.

15:01.984 --> 15:02.902
You do it.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.322
I can't do it. When I look him in the eye,
I go all wobbly.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.531
I know, right?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.243
There you go. 

15:11.327 --> 15:15.623
Oh, my Lord.
Six foot four and a heavy pour...

15:19.877 --> 15:21.921
I can see how he would grow on you.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.967
Yeah, Danny's pretty special.

15:27.051 --> 15:27.885
Hmm.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.013
-[Gabe] Hey! Um...
-[stammers]

15:32.222 --> 15:34.808
Captain Morgan,
would you like to sit down and, uh...?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.018
Yeah.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.983
Oh, check it out, Mr. Hayward.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.153
I got junior colleges here,
state colleges over there,

15:46.236 --> 15:48.364
and Whitney wanted to be all by herself.

15:49.615 --> 15:54.036
In life, you'll find the Whitneys
of the world march to their own drum

15:55.412 --> 15:57.414
in a parade you're not invited to.

16:00.292 --> 16:04.713
Mr. Hayward, I've updated my transcript
with my class' academic decathlon victory.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.257
Seems a little premature.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.301
The decathlon's not till next week.

16:09.385 --> 16:13.222
Yeah, Mr. Iglesias is drilling us.
We could totally beat you honors kids.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.684
[laughing]

16:16.767 --> 16:18.143
That is hilarious.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.855
Oh, then why are you
the only one laughing?

16:23.482 --> 16:25.901
Hey, hey, hey, how's it going over here?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.946
Uh, great. Did you know
Long Beach State's baseball team

16:29.029 --> 16:30.364
is called the Dirtbags?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.450
No way.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.704
That place sounds awesome! [laughs]

16:37.329 --> 16:38.789
Look at this. Look at this.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.417
"Dirtbags" is pretty funny...

16:42.334 --> 16:43.585
especially to dirtbags.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.006
Only to dirtbags.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.050
Let's talk about Stanford.

16:51.927 --> 16:52.761
Look...

16:53.554 --> 16:57.307
I'm gonna be the first person in my family
to go to college at all, so...

16:58.350 --> 17:00.019
Long Beach State is a huge win for me.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.688
I get it. Long Beach is a great school.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.607
Yeah, man. It's even got the word "beach"
right in the name.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.652
And "long"!

17:10.029 --> 17:11.030
And "state."

17:12.906 --> 17:16.243
Are you sure you wanna be sitting
next to these knuckleheads

17:16.326 --> 17:17.536
for the next four to six years?

17:19.663 --> 17:22.875
I know I'm not getting through to you,
so I called your mom.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.461
[chuckles]

17:27.755 --> 17:29.173
And how did that talk go?

17:29.381 --> 17:32.468
[chuckles] Well, it went pretty well.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.763
It might've gone even better

17:35.846 --> 17:37.848
-if I understood a lick of Spanish.
-Ah.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.520
Like, I know Danny and I
are supposed to be rivals,

17:43.645 --> 17:46.607
but I just can't be mad at the guy.
He's too nice.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.235
Yeah, you guys are rivals
like the Lakers and Clippers are rivals.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.656
One has 16 championships,
and the other has zero.

17:55.949 --> 17:56.909
Which am I?

17:56.992 --> 17:58.577
I don't know, Little Clipper.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.083
Watch out, your friend Thor: Ragnarok
is in there.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.379
He just changed the bottle
on the water cooler, the big one, solo.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.013
Hey, go easy on Danny, bro.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.932
He's a big guy, but he's tender.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.852
Dude, I wrote the book on big,
tender guys.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.773
I got this, for Abby. 

18:28.107 --> 18:30.275
Danny's going home tonight.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.281
-Hey, Danny.
-Hey, I got your text and your fritter.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.368
Pietris Bakery?

18:39.451 --> 18:42.538
Oh, my God, these--
This is my favorite. How did you know?

18:42.621 --> 18:44.915
Oh, Abby mentioned it 11 months ago.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002
Wow, you are a great listener.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.587
Sometimes.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.674
Well, I need you to listen to this.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.510
Abby is ready to move on.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.304
Oh, boy, is she really?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.056
Yeah, she told me.
That's why I called you.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.349
Of course.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.268
It was a warning.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.686
No, just an update.

19:06.937 --> 19:11.900
Right. Gabriel, my own personal archangel,
deciphering yet another vision.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.986
I'm not deciphering anything, dude.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.029
I'm just repeating what Abby
told me yesterday.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.906
You gotta go home.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.451
♪ Oh, Danny boy ♪

19:21.952 --> 19:24.913
♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling ♪

19:26.373 --> 19:27.749
I have a lot of white friends.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.212
But you're right, Gabe, you're right.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.673
Home, South Dakota, I get it.

19:34.965 --> 19:35.924
Thank God.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.385
No, thank Gabe.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.683
-Oh, hey.
-Hi, guys.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.684
Hi.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.853
Damn, Pietris Bakery.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.441
Oh! I picked a bad year to be off carbs.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.153
So, did you guys have a good talk?

19:56.236 --> 19:57.404
Yeah, one of our best.

19:57.487 --> 20:01.742
Yeah, when Gabe lays things out for me, 
no matter how confused I was before,

20:02.201 --> 20:03.952
he clears it all up.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.287
-[chuckles]
-So...

20:06.246 --> 20:08.248
Abigail Myrtle Spencer...

20:08.498 --> 20:09.541
What's happening?

20:11.084 --> 20:12.377
I know, "Myrtle"?

20:15.714 --> 20:18.508
Look, Tony,
now you guys are the same height.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.640
I don't suppose you're just showing
your support of the NFL protestors.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.726
I wanted to do this someplace
more romantic.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.937
Oh, Tony, are these lights on a dimmer?

20:33.815 --> 20:34.691
No.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.529
Will you come home to South Dakota...

20:40.530 --> 20:41.865
and marry me?

20:43.367 --> 20:46.453
-[gasps]
-Not what we talked about, bro.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.540
Oh, Danny,
this is all a little overwhelming.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.917
[whispers] Don't look in his eyes.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.170
How could she not?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.590
Yes! Yes!

20:58.674 --> 21:01.218
For the second and hopefully last time,

21:01.301 --> 21:02.803
yes, I'll marry you.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.304
[chuckles]

21:07.891 --> 21:09.643
Well, my work is done.

21:13.146 --> 21:13.981
[grunts]

21:14.731 --> 21:15.816
Good luck, you guys.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.199
I did not see that coming. 

21:24.324 --> 21:25.284
Uh-uh.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.495
I can't believe I'm going to lose
one of my best teachers.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.707
I can't believe I'm gonna lose
my new best friend. No offense.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.377
Still don't think you get
the "no offense" thing.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.423
Look, I know Abby's been all over the map
with Danny,

21:39.506 --> 21:42.134
like Carmen Sandiego
on a weekend getaway, but...

21:43.593 --> 21:46.179
if she's happy,
we should be happy for her.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.933
Gabe, you know how you always think
of everybody else instead of yourself?

21:50.267 --> 21:51.977
-Mm-hmm.
-It's weird.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.691
We've all been thinking it.
I'm glad somebody finally told you.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.195
Well, as weird as it may sound,
I'm just thinking about my friend.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.155
Something's going on.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.448
I'mma find out what it is.

22:08.035 --> 22:08.994
Hey, Cupid.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.538
Hey, mind if I join you?

22:12.122 --> 22:13.206
Yeah, sure.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.542
Abby...  Abby... Abby... Abby...

22:16.501 --> 22:17.586
I am so confused.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.089
You know, when you told me to tell Danny
to go home,

22:21.173 --> 22:24.217
I had no idea you wanted to go with him.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.430
[sighs] Well, I didn't at first, but...

22:29.139 --> 22:30.974
then he did that thing with his eyes.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.477
What thing? Opening them?

22:34.978 --> 22:39.066
"Forgive, and you will be forgiven."
Luke 6:37.

22:39.775 --> 22:43.445
"Luke, I am your father."
Darth Vader, 1980.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.529
Yeah.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.741
Look, are you sure this is what you want?

22:48.158 --> 22:49.659
I mean, I'm-- I'm pretty sure.

22:49.743 --> 22:53.372
I keep trying to convince myself
that what I want is to meet a cool guy

22:53.455 --> 22:55.165
and have adventures here in California.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.918
Have you considered California Adventure?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.753
It's right in the name.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.672
When I meet a guy out here,

23:02.756 --> 23:05.759
I just know he's not gonna
spend six months holding hands,

23:05.842 --> 23:07.010
getting to know me.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.637
That's what Danny did.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.890
Wow. Man, I grew up here
in Long Beach, and...

23:12.140 --> 23:13.683
[chuckles] ...you are correct.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.228
Six months.

23:16.895 --> 23:17.771
Está pendeja.

23:19.856 --> 23:20.816
-Gabe.
-Yes.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.069
The real reason I couldn't move on

23:24.152 --> 23:27.531
is because Danny
is the only man I've ever been with.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.410
-Ah, okay.
-You know, in that way?

23:31.493 --> 23:32.411
Yeah, I-- I get it.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.205
-You know, biblically-wise.
-Ah!

23:35.288 --> 23:37.249
The-- [stammers] Hey. We're good.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.126
-[chuckles]
-Oh, you got it. Okay.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.548
Yo, I need five more boxes.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.593
Grandma loves chocolate
more than her doctor's orders.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.470
You're light, Lorenzo.

23:52.472 --> 23:55.100
He had one bar, man.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.228
You gotta take a taste
to know what you're selling.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.273
Five-oh, five-oh.

24:03.567 --> 24:07.487
[stammers] Hey, check it out, Mr. Hayward.
My itinerary for our trip up north.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.572
Huh.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.533
"Walter Dobbs at Cal"?

24:11.908 --> 24:12.868
At Stanford?

24:12.951 --> 24:17.080
-[laughing] That is hilarious.
-Hmm.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.374
-You know, you're as funny as Lorenzo.
-[chuckles]

24:20.375 --> 24:22.043
Yo, what is this white B talking about?

24:25.964 --> 24:28.091
Hey, you ever been in a fight before?

24:36.558 --> 24:39.102
You know, Whitney's mean,
but she ain't wrong.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.397
These schools might be a reach, Walt.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.442
Oh, I don't wanna enroll,
I just wanna visit "Berserkley."

24:45.525 --> 24:48.236
Hey... [chuckles]

24:48.320 --> 24:49.321
You know, Haight-Ashbury,

24:49.404 --> 24:52.282
the place where the freak show began.
Summer of Love.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.075
[laughs]

24:56.119 --> 24:57.412
Yeah, I was there.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.039
What was it like?

25:00.415 --> 25:01.750
I have no recollection.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.588
Marisol, you need to sell ten boxes
to get to Stanford.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.966
Nah, my bus fare to Long Beach State
should only cost half a Twix.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.760
Twix? Mm-hmm.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.262
I knew you were gonna be stubborn, so...

25:15.096 --> 25:16.890
I brought in the big guns.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.228
[breathes deeply]

25:23.021 --> 25:25.023
Do I smell chocolate bars in bulk?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.527
Yeah, I-- I called your mom again.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.695
Yeah, and then you handed me the phone.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.074
I see where you get your toughness.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.660
Did she tease you for not being married
and not having kids?

25:37.160 --> 25:40.455
There was some verbal abuse in that area.
Mm-hmm.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.458
But she also made it clear
that it would break her heart

25:43.542 --> 25:45.877
to stand in the way of your education.
Or as she put it:

25:46.211 --> 25:48.213
[speaking Spanish]

25:59.099 --> 26:01.101
Yup, you definitely had the right number.

26:01.768 --> 26:02.644
Are you mad?

26:03.395 --> 26:04.437
A little.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.439
At myself.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.691
Oh.

26:08.066 --> 26:11.152
If you're gonna invest
this much effort into my future,

26:11.987 --> 26:14.072
I guess I have to invest in myself too.

26:14.990 --> 26:19.494
There you go. Well, I'm gonna invest
in ten boxes of chocolate.

26:20.787 --> 26:21.788
Bill me.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.667
I'm gonna take one right now
and make sure they're good.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.088
If you need me,
I'll be in my car, passed out.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.678
It's been a crazy couple of days, huh?

26:36.970 --> 26:37.971
Oh, not really.

26:38.054 --> 26:41.391
I called a guy I've never met
who ignored everything I said,

26:41.474 --> 26:43.101
and now you're gonna marry him.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.186
Boring.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.897
[chuckles, sighs]

26:48.273 --> 26:49.649
He's pretty great, isn't he?

26:49.941 --> 26:51.401
Yeah, for South Dakota.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.030
North Dakota, South America,
North America.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.324
Yeah, I'm not gay, but you know,
if we were locked up...

26:57.407 --> 26:58.283
Yeah.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.036
He is pretty great.

27:01.911 --> 27:02.954
You know who else is great?

27:03.913 --> 27:04.873
You.

27:05.415 --> 27:09.836
Aw, Gaber. [chuckles]
I don't know about that.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.589
Sometimes,
I just feel like such a big chicken.

27:12.672 --> 27:13.715
Are you kidding?

27:13.798 --> 27:17.510
Who moves from a cow pasture
to a big city by themselves?

27:17.802 --> 27:19.220
A brave person, that's who.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.224
Huh.
I never really thought of myself as brave.

27:23.558 --> 27:27.228
Talented, smart, warm, kind,

27:28.063 --> 27:30.523
funny, crafty, sure...

27:32.400 --> 27:33.485
but never brave.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.113
Well, you should, because you're
one of the bravest people I know.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.282
Hmm.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.246
-Danny?
-Shortcake?

27:50.960 --> 27:54.881
You know, I've never loved anyone
as much as I've loved you,

27:55.507 --> 27:58.510
and you'll always hold a special place
in my heart.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.346
Uh... My-- My eyes are up here.

28:01.429 --> 28:04.057
[whispers] Don't fall for it, girl.
Look away.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.144
[sighs] No, I'm brave.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.063
I can do this.

28:11.898 --> 28:14.651
Danny, I can't move back home with you.

28:14.734 --> 28:18.780
What? Why not?
It's always been you and me, Red.

28:18.988 --> 28:23.410
Uh, speaking of red, have you guys read
the new chimichanga flavors they have?

28:25.495 --> 28:27.163
They even have pictures.

28:29.624 --> 28:33.044
I can't move back home with you, Danny,
because I am home.

28:33.294 --> 28:36.214
And whoever I marry, even you, handsome,

28:36.548 --> 28:37.882
has gotta earn my trust

28:37.966 --> 28:41.177
by holding hands with me
for six months in Long Beach

28:41.261 --> 28:43.555
before they even get into
the batter's box.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.224
Good to know.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.980
I'm sorry, Danny, but those are my terms.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.607
Hey, tough break, bro.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.484
But you think we could be
Facebook friends?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.153
I sent you a request, no pressure.

28:58.862 --> 29:02.824
Facebook? We're gonna be roommates.
I'm gonna need a place to stay.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.952
I'm heading back to Sioux Falls,
finishing my contract,

29:06.035 --> 29:08.538
and I'm moving here to win Abby back.

29:10.373 --> 29:13.501
Long Beach, most livable city in America.

29:14.878 --> 29:15.920
Champagne?

29:20.425 --> 29:23.595
I have never seen anyone take rejection
so well.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.638
He's even good at that.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.433
To our brave girl, Abby.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.517
To Danny.

29:30.727 --> 29:31.728
To Gaber.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.607
Yeah, to the guy
who has to drive you drunk-asses home.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.859
[group chuckles]

29:41.696 --> 29:44.115
[theme music playing]
