00:04.540 --> 00:07.800

NEWSREADER: The death of Steve
Blakely's wife has shocked the state,

01:20.980 --> 01:27.440
and the burning question is, were his
actions deliberate or accidental?

01:27.500 --> 01:29.720
REPORTER: Observers in
the packed courtroom were surprised

01:29.780 --> 01:31.200
by several heated exchanges

01:31.260 --> 01:33.720
between the Coroner
and a clearly distressed Blakely,

01:33.780 --> 01:36.640
who refused to concede
it was an act of mercy.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.720
Experts from each side took
a backseat as the arguments...

01:39.780 --> 01:41.800
NEWSREADER: Many Blakely critics
say the criminal justice system

01:41.860 --> 01:45.120
will treat a high-ranking police
officer more leniently

01:45.180 --> 01:47.200
than an ordinary citizen.

01:47.260 --> 01:51.000
Nonetheless, amid demands
for his immediate dismissal,

01:51.060 --> 01:53.720
Assistant Commissioner
Steven Blakely remains on leave

01:53.780 --> 01:56.440
until the Coroner's findings
are published.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.000
But this is a scandal the government
would like to end quickly,

02:00.060 --> 02:03.000
and one of the most highly respected
investigators in the State

02:03.060 --> 02:05.720
may soon find his career in tatters.

02:05.780 --> 02:09.680
Janet! Are you sure it's in here?
I can't see it.

02:09.740 --> 02:11.920
JANET: It must be in there somewhere.
Are you sure?

02:11.980 --> 02:14.320
What do you do with your phone
in here, anyway?

02:14.380 --> 02:16.240
Don't know. I was cleaning up...
(Honking)

02:16.300 --> 02:19.720
There's your ride.
Ah, there it is.

02:19.780 --> 02:22.560
I'll sort all this. Go, go!

02:22.620 --> 02:24.720
(Babies laugh and coo)

02:29.140 --> 02:33.240
Good-luck talisman?
They'll still be here tonight.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.800
(Honking)
I have to go.

02:34.860 --> 02:37.600
(Sighs)
Be a grown up.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.560
Yes. You do.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.400
Now.
Right, yes. OK.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.960
Got all your court stuff?
Yes.

02:43.020 --> 02:43.960
(Door closes)

02:50.100 --> 02:51.160
Hey.

02:51.220 --> 02:54.000
Sorry about the short notice.
That's alright.

02:54.060 --> 02:56.640
Been a while since I've worn anything
except trackies.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.720
You look fabulous,
after a year with the bubs.

03:01.980 --> 03:07.440
Janet! Wait! Forgot something.
I thought I had that.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.840
It was on the floor. A little hand
must have gone exploring.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.840
Did someone want to try on
Mummy's curly hair, did they?

03:12.900 --> 03:16.200
Who was that, I wonder?
Come on, 'fess up.

03:16.260 --> 03:19.320
Come here, sweetheart.
Want to come here?

03:19.380 --> 03:21.040
One final goodbye, I guess.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.880
Um, we should really...
Yeah, alright.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.320
Go to Mama.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.400
Hope it goes well.
Text me with updates, yeah?

03:31.460 --> 03:35.200
Of course we will. Bye-bye.
Bye. Bye.

03:35.260 --> 03:36.200
Bye.

03:38.540 --> 03:41.240
So, whose case am I taking over?
Ah, Geoff Green.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.840
He called in this morning
with whooping cough.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.640
How long are we adjourning for?
Um, we're not.

03:45.700 --> 03:49.720
Directions hearing?
Nope. First day of the trial.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.320
I'm starting a trial
with no preparation?

03:52.380 --> 03:55.000
It's pretty straightforward.

03:55.060 --> 03:59.200
Nothing's straightforward.
Not in my life. Not anymore.

What's he like?
Who?

04:23.220 --> 04:25.960
The accused, Alex Moreno.
Average. Normal.

04:26.020 --> 04:29.400
Normal? He was grooming
a 13-year-old girl for sex.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.480
There's nothing normal about that.

04:31.540 --> 04:34.600
13. God.

04:34.660 --> 04:38.360
We'll be fine.
You should meet Caroline.

04:38.420 --> 04:39.920
Hi.
Hey, Erin.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.600
Detective Caroline Martin,
Janet King.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.720
You're the new Geoff.
That's me.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.360
So we're going ahead,
no more delaying?

04:46.420 --> 04:47.480
Nope.
Good.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.520
Been after this bastard for years.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.440
So when you first joined
that chat room, you...

04:55.500 --> 04:57.000
..you knew who you were targetting?

04:57.060 --> 04:58.000
Absolutely.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.120
And in the chat room,
Constable Martin,

05:01.180 --> 05:03.160
did you post many messages yourself?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.320
One or two,

05:04.380 --> 05:06.280
mainly just agreeing with something
one of the others had said.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.840
They were pretty short.
So nothing directly to Mr Moreno?

05:08.900 --> 05:12.000
No question or invitation?
No.

05:12.060 --> 05:13.000
Why not?

05:13.060 --> 05:15.200
Well, groomers are looking
for vulnerability.

05:15.260 --> 05:18.080
You want to appear shy and innocent,
so I logged on as 'Sophie'..

05:18.140 --> 05:20.920
With the profile of a 13-year-old?
Objection.

05:20.980 --> 05:24.680
I'm aware that you've been
changing nappies for the last year,

05:24.740 --> 05:26.920
Madam Crown,
but certain rules of advocacy,

05:26.980 --> 05:31.320
such as not leading the witness,
are still part of the Evidence Act.

05:31.380 --> 05:35.120
Yes, Your Honour.
I withdraw the question.

05:37.260 --> 05:40.280
Uh, Constable Martin,
when you logged on as Sophie,

05:40.340 --> 05:41.760
what information about her
was available

05:41.820 --> 05:43.760
to the other people in the chat room?

05:43.820 --> 05:46.800
They thought that she was
a 13-year-old schoolgirl.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.320
And then?
I waited.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.320
Just waited?

05:51.380 --> 05:54.160
The quieter you are,
the more attractive a target.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.680
I did nothing and he made contact.

05:56.740 --> 05:59.200
And all subsequent communication
between Sophie and Mr Moreno

05:59.260 --> 06:03.320
is the full transcript in Exhibit A,
Your Honour, which I tender...

06:03.380 --> 06:05.320
Yes, which you have already
tendered, yes.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.520
I haven't forgotten.
I still have all my faculties.

06:11.220 --> 06:14.760
I have no further questions,
Your Honour.

06:14.820 --> 06:18.320
Mr Bernard?
No further questions.

06:18.380 --> 06:20.440
You're excused, Constable Martin.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.120
Your Honour, if the court pleases...

06:23.180 --> 06:26.960
The court is rather peckish,
in fact, Mr Bernard.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.480
What say you put your
no-case submission,

06:29.540 --> 06:32.080
if that's what it is, after lunch?

06:32.140 --> 06:34.640
Actually, I will be asking
the court's permission

06:34.700 --> 06:37.160
to call a witness after lunch,
Your Honour.

06:37.220 --> 06:40.640
Really? Rather late in the day
for that piece of news, isn't it?

06:40.700 --> 06:43.360
I want to call the defendant,
Mr Moreno.

06:43.420 --> 06:44.360
Very well.

06:44.420 --> 06:47.240
Your Honour, my learned colleague
cannot spring a witness on us

06:47.300 --> 06:49.480
without proper notice.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.720
It is the accused, Madam Crown.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.600
It's hardly pulling a rabbit
out of a hat.

06:53.660 --> 06:56.640
We'll break for lunch
and resume at two.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.440
COURT OFFICIAL: All rise.

06:59.500 --> 07:04.120
Did we have any idea about this?
What did he tell the police?

07:04.180 --> 07:07.720
When we first dragged him in,
he was on about being an artist.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.120
That was his excuse.

07:09.180 --> 07:12.680
Says he was making a photographic
record of the journey

07:12.740 --> 07:16.360
between innocence to maturity,
or some crap like that.

07:16.420 --> 07:19.280
But then his lawyer turned up,
told him to put a sock in it.

07:19.340 --> 07:22.240
In the circumstances,
if you want my opinion,

07:22.300 --> 07:25.400
that's the line they'll run with.

07:25.460 --> 07:28.120
Ha-hey, welcome back!
Thank you, Richard.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.040
Great office. I'll miss it. Nice
to be on the same team, at last.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.920
Owen Mitchell.
Janet King.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.240
Hey, Tony wants a word.
You got a couple of minutes?

07:37.300 --> 07:38.520
Mm.
Take care of that?

07:38.580 --> 07:42.240
Sorry. Apparently I have to run.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.320
Chief Superintendent...
Jack Rizzoli. Erin introduced us.

07:47.380 --> 07:50.320
What is he?
What, you mean nationality?

07:50.380 --> 07:52.240
Sexual orientation?
I mean, what squad? Fraud, Vice?

07:52.300 --> 07:53.880
Was boss of the Intel Directorate.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.800
Now Acting Head
of State Crime Command.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.720
Got the nod when Steven Blakely
stepped down.

07:57.780 --> 08:00.000
You heard about Blakely?
This morning.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.960
Shit! I need to express.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.960
Moreno could claim
he and Sophie never even met.

08:08.020 --> 08:11.280
Doesn't matter. As long as he incited
a minor to commit a sexual act,

08:11.340 --> 08:13.200
that's all we have to prove.
Did he?

08:13.260 --> 08:16.040
He sent her a text telling her
to masturbate before the photo shoot.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.520
Conclusive.
Can he say it wasn't him

08:17.580 --> 08:20.800
who sent the text?
There was a call from the same phone

08:20.860 --> 08:22.880
to his wife 20 seconds later.
Good.

08:22.940 --> 08:25.160
If he's saying he's an artist,
he might claim

08:25.220 --> 08:26.680
he was trying to encourage his model

08:26.740 --> 08:28.880
to have a greater sense
of adult confidence.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.200
So he wasn't seeking
any gratification at all?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.280
'No, Your Honour, I was trying
to relax a nervous subject

08:33.340 --> 08:36.320
before an artistic endeavour.'
You still sent the text.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.120
I was only trying
to get the best photo.

08:38.179 --> 08:40.919
It was all for art.'
It's still no defence.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.840
Did he send the text? Yes.
Is masturbation a sexual act? Yes.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.600
He can rave about art
till he's blue in the face,

08:45.660 --> 08:49.800
but the fact is, that is all we need.
What are you staring at?

08:51.060 --> 08:55.320
Um, is that OK?
It's just a bit watery.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.520
Yes, that's because I am not,
in fact, a cow.

09:02.180 --> 09:06.000
The Coroner's report just landed.
He's recommended charges.

09:06.060 --> 09:07.600
Against Steve?

09:07.660 --> 09:11.360
Under that new legislation,
assisted suicide.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.600
Shit.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.360
'Course, you don't have to accept
his recommendations.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.280
Imagine how that'd look.
It won't look good either way.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.680
Arrest him, you're betraying
a friend and role model.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.840
Don't arrest him,
you're protecting a mate.

09:21.900 --> 09:25.360
Is this helping? Eh,
don't suppose it is, really, is it?

09:25.420 --> 09:26.920
What a bloody joke!

09:26.980 --> 09:29.080
Do they realise
what this man's done for this State?

09:29.140 --> 09:33.080
His wife was dying, for God's sake!
And they really want him charged?

09:37.020 --> 09:39.080
Although if we do charge him,

09:39.140 --> 09:42.400
doesn't mean that you have to agree
to proceed, does it?

09:42.460 --> 09:43.800
(Laughs)

09:43.860 --> 09:46.280
Helping our new-found friends
in Crime Command is one thing,

09:46.340 --> 09:49.520
but let's see the brief before
we start assessing our options.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.080
Nonetheless, it is an option,
theoretically.

09:51.140 --> 09:53.080
Theoretically,
but we're both accountable here.

09:53.140 --> 09:57.120
Neither of us think a man like Steve
Blakely should end up in jail, do we?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.680
We both can agree on that.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.640
Well, I don't THINK he should, no.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.360
But we can't rort the system
just to get a particular outcome.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.720
Did I say 'rort'?
I didn't say 'rort'.

10:06.780 --> 10:10.160
Why don't we just leave it to a jury
and let it run?

10:10.220 --> 10:13.480
I'd do it.
(Scoffs) You'd prosecute Blakely?

10:13.540 --> 10:16.480
I handled assisted suicide matters
last year, I know the case law.

10:16.540 --> 10:18.680
It's one of the rare times
you can do your job as a prosecutor

10:18.740 --> 10:20.960
and not call for
the defendant's blood.

10:21.020 --> 10:25.240
Yes, the law was broken, but it was
a dying wish and all for love.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.840
We get the right judge
and everything is sweet.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.400
I mean, he'll get a bond,
but that's the end of it.

10:30.460 --> 10:34.160
No need for any real punishment.
Works for all of us, doesn't it?

10:41.620 --> 10:44.040
Can you state your full name
for the court, please?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.960
Alexander Moreno.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.240
Mr Moreno, you are charged
with inciting a minor

10:49.300 --> 10:50.800
to commit a sexual act.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.080
Yes.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.680
Did you?
No.

10:53.740 --> 10:57.240
And why can you say that?
Because I knew she was an adult.

10:57.300 --> 11:01.880
Right from the beginning?
Yes.

11:01.940 --> 11:02.960
Thank you.

11:03.020 --> 11:05.880
(Low murmurs)

11:12.300 --> 11:15.200
How are we going, Madam Crown?

11:15.260 --> 11:17.320
Any questions for the witness?
Yes, Your Honour.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.320
Would you care to share them
with us?

11:20.380 --> 11:24.240
Yes, Your Honour.
I just... ahem.

11:24.300 --> 11:29.800
Mr Moreno, when you were online
on the... on the 27th,

11:29.860 --> 11:32.160
and Sophie first joined
the chat room,

11:32.220 --> 11:35.600
there were six users logged on.
Yes.

11:35.660 --> 11:38.200
One of the others, not you,
asked Sophie how old she was.

11:38.260 --> 11:42.760
Correct. Ben asked her.
And she answered '13', didn't she?

11:42.820 --> 11:45.160
Yes.
So you thought she was 13.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.040
No.
No? Why?

11:47.100 --> 11:49.280
Do you assume people lie,
is that what you're saying?

11:49.340 --> 11:52.600
No, because Ben's next question
was, 'Where are you?'

11:52.660 --> 11:56.520
and she typed
'Home alone, parents out.'

11:56.580 --> 11:59.920
So?
Well, Ben's also 13.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.600
We all knew that.
He logged on often.

12:01.660 --> 12:04.800
So just because Ben's 13,
you knew Sophie wasn't?

12:04.860 --> 12:07.680
I'm sorry, do you expect the court
to believe that sort of gibberish?

12:07.740 --> 12:08.840
No.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.320
Teenagers don't use the word
'parents',

12:11.380 --> 12:12.840
well, not to each other, anyway.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.200
I know. I have a 15-year-old,
and I've watched her.

12:16.260 --> 12:22.600
If Sophie was 13 and she was real,
she would have typed 'parentals'

12:22.660 --> 12:24.600
or 'rentals' or 'rents'.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.720
So I looked at all that
and I thought, 'You're not 13'.

12:29.740 --> 12:32.200
Yet, I mean, you and Sophie
stayed in contact for months,

12:32.260 --> 12:33.680
and never questioned her age.

12:33.740 --> 12:35.800
You kept on asking about young models

12:35.860 --> 12:38.080
for an exhibition you were doing
on the loss of innocence.

12:38.140 --> 12:39.360
Sure.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.960
Well, I put it to you
that you're lying to us,

12:42.020 --> 12:44.880
and that you DID believe
that she was 13.

12:44.940 --> 12:46.800
No, I didn't.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.680
This photo was to be
the last in a series.

12:49.740 --> 12:51.120
Me and an adult.

12:51.180 --> 12:52.800
My loss of innocence in believing

12:52.860 --> 12:57.280
that you can just take
online conversations at face value.

12:57.340 --> 13:00.360
So why did you ask her to masturbate
before the shoot?

13:00.420 --> 13:02.600
That was a joke.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.400
(Mobile beeps)

13:44.980 --> 13:48.480
Should we ease back
on your workload, perhaps?

13:48.540 --> 13:50.200
Just for your first few weeks.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.400
No-no, no special treatment.

13:52.460 --> 13:57.040
You sure? It's obviously not
quite like falling off a bike.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.720
I'm fine thanks, Tracey.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.240
(Waves crash)

14:21.380 --> 14:22.840
Is that the warrant?

14:22.900 --> 14:27.520
For immediate execution, I was told.
Where is he?

14:27.580 --> 14:32.800
He's with Maya and Drew,
up at North Head with Sally's ashes.

14:32.860 --> 14:35.120
Her body wasn't released
until after the inquest,

14:35.180 --> 14:38.160
so they're up there saying goodbye
to her right now.

14:39.060 --> 14:42.960
To hell with immediate execution.
I'm not going to arrest him there.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.040
When he gets home.
I'll see him then.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.600
Might all take a few hours,
I'm sorry.

14:51.660 --> 14:55.080
That's OK. Just wake me.
We shouldn't waste a good week.

15:01.820 --> 15:03.280
(Knocking)

15:25.820 --> 15:28.840
Nice. Yep.

15:28.900 --> 15:32.280
(Indistinct talking over tannoy)

15:40.540 --> 15:43.480
Handy having this so close, huh?
Oh, hello.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.880
Bit of a tough day in the end.
They pulled a swifty.

15:45.940 --> 15:48.720
We've still got closing addresses,
so all is not lost.

15:48.780 --> 15:52.080
Might come and listen to them.
By all means.

15:52.140 --> 15:54.400
It must be a slow day for policing
if the head of Crime Command

15:54.460 --> 15:55.800
wants to hang around the courts.

15:55.860 --> 15:58.240
Part of my previous job with Intel.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.240
Convictions were getting harder,
you know,

16:00.300 --> 16:03.120
all that work coming to nothing,
so word came down from the top

16:03.180 --> 16:06.320
that we had to start working
a bit closer with the DPP.

16:06.380 --> 16:07.880
Lucky you.

16:08.940 --> 16:11.520
Boy and a girl?
Twins.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.360
Twins? You seem so calm and relaxed.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.120
Only to the untrained eye.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.480
Mr King must be
a very supportive husband.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.200
Actually, I don't have a Mr King.

16:20.260 --> 16:21.680
Sorry.
No, it's fine.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.160
I do have...
(Mobile rings)

16:23.220 --> 16:25.320
It's my mother.
I'm cooking for her tonight

16:25.380 --> 16:27.760
and she wants to make sure
I've got everything.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.080
Once a mum, always a mum.
Yeah.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.880
One more. That's it.
(Baby cries)

16:33.940 --> 16:36.040
I couldn't get them in sync today.
Is there a trick to it?

16:36.100 --> 16:38.560
Blind luck.
(Chuckles)

16:38.620 --> 16:41.320
OK, that's good.
I'll stop feeling so inadequate.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.520
Can you be home by five
on Wednesday?

16:43.580 --> 16:45.560
Yeah, Wednesday.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.960
Pilates, remember?
Oh. Yep, sure.

16:48.020 --> 16:50.560
Good boy. Come on, darling.
(Babies cry)

16:50.620 --> 16:53.560
How was your day?
Um, challenging.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.840
We had a paedophile
who was posing as...

16:55.900 --> 16:58.640
Just ignore him. Punishment
will be counterproductive.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.520
..who was posing as an artist.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.840
He knows it's wrong.
He's just trying to test me.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.280
(Baby cries)

17:04.339 --> 17:05.720
(Sighs)

17:05.780 --> 17:07.119
Sorry. What?

17:07.180 --> 17:09.400
Is punishment counterproductive?

17:09.460 --> 17:11.000
That's actually
quite a big statement.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.200
It all depends on the context,
I suppose.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.119
Let's just try and distract him.

17:18.140 --> 17:21.119
Mm, yum. You are brilliant.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.760
You wouldn't say that
if you saw me in court today.

17:24.819 --> 17:27.079
Oh, give me a break. Day one.

17:27.140 --> 17:31.120
Nothing seemed to quite... fit.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.760
Do you want me to...?
No, are you kidding?

17:49.820 --> 17:51.760
She's settled.

17:54.220 --> 17:57.960
Do you want to talk about work?
Later.

17:58.020 --> 18:01.600
We might watch some TV.
We'll keep the volume down.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.680
Night-night.
Goodnight.

18:09.380 --> 18:13.280
(Whispers indistinctly)
(Whispering) What's on TV?

18:13.340 --> 18:14.760
Well, Assistant Commissioner Blakely

18:14.820 --> 18:18.360
was very cooperative,
as you'd expect.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.000
REPORTER: Will he be pleading guilty?

18:22.060 --> 18:23.440
Well, that's a question

18:23.500 --> 18:25.800
for the Assistant Commissioner
and his lawyers.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.520
REPORTER: So he hasn't made any
indication of his intention to plead?

18:28.580 --> 18:32.840
Ah, no. No, he hasn't,
which is entirely appropriate

18:32.900 --> 18:34.320
considering the circumstances.

18:35.820 --> 18:37.640
NEWSREADER: Assistant Commissioner
Steven Blakely

18:37.700 --> 18:38.960
first came to prominence

18:39.020 --> 18:43.040
in the mid-1980s with several
high-profile underworld arrests.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.440
He then transferred
to the National Crime Authority,

18:45.500 --> 18:48.200
where he was responsible
for the seizure of illegal drugs

18:48.260 --> 18:51.200
with a street value
of more than 200 million...

18:51.260 --> 18:53.760
Who's looking at it?
Richard.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.920
Oh, good. He needs a bit
of real-world pressure.

18:55.980 --> 18:57.560
Have you assigned a crown yet?

18:57.620 --> 18:59.680
I thought you might
want to be consulted.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.400
Whatever you think. I'm impartial.

19:01.460 --> 19:04.600
Anyone in particular
I should impartially favour?

19:04.660 --> 19:07.640
No. Yes. No.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.720
Yes or no?

19:09.780 --> 19:12.520
(Sighs) Maybe not Owen Mitchell.
Not Owen?

19:12.580 --> 19:14.120
Too close to Jack Rizzoli.

19:14.180 --> 19:17.120
Oh, I thought we were now in favour
of closer ties with the police.

19:17.180 --> 19:18.720
I was, am, but I'm beginning to sense

19:18.780 --> 19:21.240
why my illustrious predecessor
was opposed to it.

19:21.300 --> 19:25.160
Look, whoever's got the least on.
Just keep it purely objective.

19:29.860 --> 19:32.360
Owen.
Tracey.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.240
How did I know
you'd be wanting a word?

19:34.300 --> 19:36.840
In case you're wondering, yes,
I've moved that assault matter,

19:36.900 --> 19:38.320
delayed the butcher of Branxton case

19:38.380 --> 19:41.120
and I am primed and ready
for Blakely.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.000
Janet's got it.

19:43.060 --> 19:45.680
She has no prior history
with Blakely at all.

19:45.740 --> 19:48.800
That's what it came down to.
Much better for everyone.

19:48.860 --> 19:50.360
Well, not everyone.

19:51.660 --> 19:55.320
For the transparency of process.

19:55.380 --> 19:58.640
So in deciding who gets what
now Janet's back,

19:58.700 --> 20:02.000
what, sometimes it's seniority,
sometimes it's take it in turns,

20:02.060 --> 20:04.400
and sometimes it's like,
what, a judgement call?

20:04.460 --> 20:07.440
You could express it that way.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.080
Any chance of getting
a little a heads-up

20:09.140 --> 20:12.480
on which ones fall
into which category?

20:12.540 --> 20:13.800
Possibly.

20:18.940 --> 20:21.040
What happened? 50 words or less.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.320
Sally Blakely
was diagnosed a year ago.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.320
Oesophageal cancer, aggressive.

20:25.380 --> 20:28.240
She was at home, couldn't swallow,

20:28.300 --> 20:31.720
very little chance of recovery,
but not quite in the final stage.

20:31.780 --> 20:33.680
Had a butterfly needle
in her abdomen,

20:33.740 --> 20:35.800
so Blakely could give her a syringe
every so often -

20:35.860 --> 20:37.720
a mixture of midazolam and morphine.

20:37.780 --> 20:42.040
He kept a record of what he used
and how much he had in the house.

20:42.100 --> 20:46.040
Just after 7pm she started looking
in a lot of pain, according to him,

20:46.100 --> 20:49.880
and within ten minutes,
he'd given her three injections.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.000
How many?

20:51.060 --> 20:52.520
Three.
Three syringes?

20:52.580 --> 20:56.120
And then he called the hospital
at 8:14,

20:56.180 --> 20:59.200
and when the ambulance arrived
at 8:26 she was already dead.

20:59.260 --> 21:02.640
So it WAS intentional?
Three in ten minutes?

21:03.700 --> 21:07.320
Oh. So you've brought in some
backup for Moreno.

21:07.380 --> 21:11.160
Ah, no. Richard's instructing
on the Blakely matter.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.480
Oh. Good.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.920
So, intentional?

21:21.980 --> 21:24.360
Well, the police have charged him
with assisted suicide.

21:24.420 --> 21:25.840
That's law now, is it?

21:25.900 --> 21:27.320
It's still a crime
because you kill someone,

21:27.380 --> 21:30.360
but if the evidence supports
a terminal illness

21:30.420 --> 21:33.360
and the victim clearly wanted death,
the range of sentencing is low.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.120
That's what the Coroner thinks?
Yes.

21:35.180 --> 21:37.480
But Blakely says
it was just pain relief.

21:37.540 --> 21:39.560
Well, she's certainly not in pain
any longer.

21:39.620 --> 21:42.720
He's maintained it was the stress
of watching a loved one in agony,

21:42.780 --> 21:44.400
just wanting it to stop.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.440
There was no real thought
of death at all.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.000
Although according to the daughter,

21:48.060 --> 21:50.960
Mrs Blakely said she'd rather die
quickly than linger on.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.760
What about the son?
No, he doesn't agree, interestingly.

21:53.820 --> 21:55.240
Should I bring Drew Blakely in?

21:55.300 --> 21:57.160
Yes.
OK.

21:57.220 --> 21:58.480
Thank you.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.320
So why Janet King?

22:01.380 --> 22:03.440
I believe it came down
to availability.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.920
You didn't think to look
at who might be a better fit?

22:05.980 --> 22:09.000
I'm sorry, are you questioning
how I manage my staff?

22:09.060 --> 22:12.200
Just a query.
She only just came back to work.

22:12.260 --> 22:14.240
She's bringing up twins.

22:14.300 --> 22:17.080
It wasn't exactly a stellar return
to the courtroom yesterday.

22:17.140 --> 22:19.440
I'd back her against anyone else
on this floor.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.080
Even out and out champions
don't win every race.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.280
Maybe so,

22:23.340 --> 22:26.680
but she hasn't had an assisted
suicide case before, and Owen has.

22:26.740 --> 22:29.480
So when the media asks why the DPP
hasn't gone back to the man

22:29.540 --> 22:32.280
with the runs on the board
regarding a tricky piece of new law,

22:32.340 --> 22:34.880
your answer's going to be?
Well, how could we?

22:34.940 --> 22:37.880
Owen Mitchell came to the bar
via police prosecution.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.200
Yes, I know that.

22:39.260 --> 22:43.080
Before that he actually worked
as a detective under Steven Blakely.

22:43.140 --> 22:46.560
It would have been a clear
conflict of interest.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.320
I knew it was something.

22:49.820 --> 22:53.200
Yes. I see your dilemma.

22:59.300 --> 23:03.240
When was the last time
you saw your mother alive, Drew?

23:03.300 --> 23:05.480
The day before.
Your dad was there?

23:05.540 --> 23:07.960
He was in the house, but he left us
alone for half an hour or so.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.320
(Knocking)

23:10.380 --> 23:12.760
Hi. Keep going, please.

23:12.820 --> 23:15.080
(Door closes)

23:15.140 --> 23:19.800
I talked to her for a bit,
about stuff. Nothing serious.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.920
CDs, books.

23:22.980 --> 23:25.880
She wanted me to buy some books
on CD.

23:25.940 --> 23:27.360
You know how much she liked to read.

23:27.420 --> 23:30.040
Yeah. Always had a book in her hand.
That was Mum.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.240
Did she ever indicate
that she'd had enough,

23:32.300 --> 23:34.800
was tired of living,
words to that effect?

23:34.860 --> 23:36.280
I mean, maybe to Dad.

23:36.340 --> 23:38.400
But not to you?
No.

23:38.460 --> 23:41.960
Are you absolutely certain you never
heard her say anything like that?

23:42.020 --> 23:43.240
Yeah.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.760
And if you were asked whether
you thought your father

23:45.820 --> 23:48.600
could've ended your mother's life,
what would you say?

23:48.660 --> 23:51.400
I won't have to say any of this
in front of him in court, will I?

23:51.460 --> 23:55.120
Well, we honestly don't know
at the moment.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.560
I suppose...

24:02.140 --> 24:03.240
(Sighs)

24:03.300 --> 24:07.720
Look, the thing is, see,
everything's black or white to Dad.

24:08.940 --> 24:12.080
He loved her. I mean, you know
how much he loved her.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.680
You saw us all together, right?

24:13.740 --> 24:17.200
But he's always like,
'That's right, that's wrong'.

24:17.260 --> 24:19.120
There's very little grey in Dad.

24:19.180 --> 24:21.800
So if it got to a point where
that seemed right, then...

24:25.700 --> 24:27.400
..then, yeah, it's possible.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.320
God, I suppose I could see it
going that way.

24:34.780 --> 24:37.120
OK. Thanks, Drew.

24:37.180 --> 24:40.560
We'll be in touch, mate.
Someone will see you out.

24:43.620 --> 24:44.920
Just this way.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.800
He's a credible witness.

24:50.860 --> 24:54.320
So is his sister, and she says
her mum DID want to die.

24:54.380 --> 24:55.840
So where are we?

24:55.900 --> 24:58.720
Well, whichever way we go,
we can't drop it.

24:58.780 --> 25:01.160
What do we go with?

25:01.220 --> 25:03.200
You've charged him
with assisted suicide,

25:03.260 --> 25:05.400
and yet Blakely himself says
it was an accident.

25:05.460 --> 25:08.080
Which could be manslaughter.
It was sort of an accident.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.400
That's what we think.

25:09.460 --> 25:12.840
But if it really was intentional,
then that could be murder.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.280
Which is what it would've been
a year ago.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.440
If we can't prove that Sally
wanted to die,

25:17.500 --> 25:19.280
then we have to go for manslaughter.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.000
Do me a summary
and I'll discuss it with Tony.

25:35.140 --> 25:38.760
Charge me with assisted suicide,
they bump it up to manslaughter.

25:40.860 --> 25:44.200
They want a big scalp, do they?
Not really.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.640
I mean, it's not like they want
a custodial sentence or anything,

25:46.700 --> 25:52.440
but... they don't want it
to look like a sham, either.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.800
The problem is,

25:53.860 --> 25:56.200
Sally didn't leave anything
indicating what she really wanted.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.360
And while Maya'll say
Sally did want it to end,

25:58.420 --> 25:59.920
if Drew's asked
he'll say she didn't,

25:59.980 --> 26:01.680
or at least that
he never heard her say it.

26:01.740 --> 26:05.480
Yeah, but Drew and Sally,
they loved each other.

26:05.540 --> 26:08.640
She would never have wanted to
burden him with something like that.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.160
He would have freaked out?
He's getting better now.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.120
He's found his niche in computing.

26:13.180 --> 26:17.720
Makes decent money, but if you'd
put something on him, you know,

26:17.780 --> 26:20.760
I mean, emotionally,
he just clams up. Always has.

26:20.820 --> 26:24.800
I tried to shake it out of him,
but you are what you are, I suppose.

26:24.860 --> 26:29.280
But then I would say that in
my position, wouldn't I? (Chuckles)

26:29.340 --> 26:32.880
And I can see their point.
A weak charge makes them look weak.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.360
Oh, well, there's nothing
I can do about it.

26:38.940 --> 26:42.880
You got a good lawyer?
A good lawyer? (Chuckles)

26:44.220 --> 26:46.520
Now what makes a good lawyer,
I wonder?

26:55.340 --> 26:58.040
You got any plans for tonight?

26:58.100 --> 27:00.640
Oh, no, I...

27:00.700 --> 27:02.840
Guess I'll finish this
if there's nothing on telly.

27:02.900 --> 27:05.320
Well, we can't have that, can we?

27:08.100 --> 27:09.720
I'll just give Lina a call.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.040
(Distant siren)

27:19.180 --> 27:22.240
(Dance music plays)

27:24.700 --> 27:26.280
So, um...

27:28.060 --> 27:31.240
Lenny.
Ah, Lenny McPherson.

27:31.300 --> 27:35.040
Had hands like bloody shovels.
No, he was a good get.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.040
I worked on that for bloody years.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.080
Anyone you didn't get?
Not many.

27:40.140 --> 27:44.640
George Freeman and Danny Novak.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.400
They were the two I really wanted.

27:47.460 --> 27:52.400
But George beat us to heaven,
or hell, as the case may be,

27:52.460 --> 27:54.560
and Danny got smart, didn't he?

27:54.620 --> 27:57.000
And then there
was the Royal Commission.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.760
In one year we went
from a dodgy force

27:58.820 --> 28:01.800
that was controlling the whole
bloody State to a clean one

28:01.860 --> 28:03.640
that handed the crims the advantage.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.480
Still, you can't be wishing
for the good old days.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.320
Oh, no, don't get me wrong.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.040
Something had to be done.
It was getting ridiculous.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.560
But we lost a whole
generation of experience,

28:12.620 --> 28:17.280
and then all of a sudden we've got
kids and university students

28:17.340 --> 28:18.960
taking on hardened killers.

28:19.020 --> 28:21.840
And everything's on camera now,
so you can't get angry,

28:21.900 --> 28:23.600
you can't get upset.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.760
Well, no wonder the bloody
conviction rate's plummeted.

28:26.820 --> 28:29.400
Well, actually, they're going up
again this year.

28:29.460 --> 28:33.440
(Laughs) Oh, yeah. Yes,
I heard that from Jack Rizzoli too.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.720
Isn't it funny,
that when the pollies swear blind

28:36.780 --> 28:40.280
they're going to get tough on crime,
convictions go up.

28:40.340 --> 28:43.600
Is that because all of a sudden
we're better at our job

28:43.660 --> 28:47.200
or your lot are better at yours?

28:47.260 --> 28:48.200
Both.
Us.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.640
Maybe, maybe. Be hard to explain
otherwise, wouldn't it?

28:53.340 --> 28:59.640
Good polly. Good cop. Good lawyer.

28:59.700 --> 29:03.120
What are they,
when you get right down to it?

29:03.180 --> 29:08.880
I tell you one thing,
a good man is never beaten by fear.

29:14.860 --> 29:17.000
KID: Ready? Watch this!
KID 2: Bring it on!

29:17.060 --> 29:18.520
(Laughs)

29:23.060 --> 29:25.560
If there's anything, you know,
I can do, just...

29:25.620 --> 29:27.680
Nah, nah. Thanks, mate, thanks.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.440
Thanks, Lina, thanks.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.800
Oh, God, I miss her.

29:44.060 --> 29:50.000
No, no, no, no, see,
they don't understand how it feels.

29:50.060 --> 29:56.920
You watch your love, the love
of your life, in so much pain.

29:56.980 --> 30:00.680
She could barely breathe, mate.

30:00.740 --> 30:03.680
But then afterwards
she was so full,

30:03.740 --> 30:10.600
and not just her,
the whole room was full... of peace.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.560
Love...
WOMAN: Ready? We're on.

30:17.620 --> 30:19.400
..that's all there is.
(Knocking)

30:19.460 --> 30:22.440
REPORTER: Mr Blakely, we have a lady
who claims you deliberately shut down

30:22.500 --> 30:24.320
the investigation
into her daughter's death.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.320
Do you remember Oriana Vasilich?
Yeah, yeah.

30:26.380 --> 30:28.560
This is Dianne.
Do you know who killed her daughter?

30:28.620 --> 30:31.960
No, I do not.
Liar! You've known for years!

30:32.020 --> 30:35.640
Here's everyone saying what a great
man you are, but it's all lies.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.440
He was paid off,
that's what happened.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.920
He never lifted a finger.
ANDY: That's enough.

30:40.980 --> 30:42.840
Was it laziness or was it corruption?

30:42.900 --> 30:44.600
Do we know all the facts
about Steven Blakely?

30:44.660 --> 30:46.480
And could it mean the recent death
of his wife

30:46.540 --> 30:50.120
is simply the callous act of a man
with much to hide?

30:50.180 --> 30:52.200
Can't get an unbiased jury
with these sort of headlines.

30:52.260 --> 30:55.200
Well, I think that's up to the
defence, given the accusations.

30:55.260 --> 30:58.800
I would've thought a respect for
fairness might reflect well on us.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.600
Owen,
don't you have your own matters?

31:00.660 --> 31:03.600
I also thought second and third
opinions were valued in here.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.680
Yes...
When sought, usually.

31:05.740 --> 31:09.400
Who is this Oriana girl, anyway?
Unsolved case from '94.

31:09.460 --> 31:13.440
Working girl. Smart, gorgeous
and apparently a fantastic root.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.840
So I heard.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.640
Then got involved with some
very powerful people,

31:16.700 --> 31:18.480
and one day she disappeared.

31:18.540 --> 31:22.360
Probably started wanting too much.
Background knowledge can help.

31:22.420 --> 31:25.880
It can also highlight an existing
relationship with the accused,

31:25.940 --> 31:28.120
for those who want to find reasons
to get a trial abandoned.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.440
So it gets abandoned.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.640
Where did the manslaughter charge
come from anyway?

31:31.700 --> 31:33.440
What genius thought
that was appropriate?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.640
We all did.
Brilliant.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.120
It might work out better
than assisted suicide, actually.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.000
(Phone rings)

31:44.940 --> 31:47.800
Hey.
Oh! Don't scare me!

31:47.860 --> 31:50.640
What's new in the Sex Crimes Unit?

31:50.700 --> 31:55.400
Sadly, nothing.
Just more and more of the same.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.640
What's this?

31:57.700 --> 32:01.880
36,000 hard copies of child porn
from a Russian internet site.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.600
Who takes these?

32:03.660 --> 32:07.280
Mostly candid shots,
bedrooms and bathrooms.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.680
Their parents?
Don't think about it.

32:09.740 --> 32:12.320
Just contemplate
the marvels of the internet.

32:12.380 --> 32:14.440
Timothy Clarke.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.840
50-year-old father of two,
takes in his computer for repairs.

32:17.900 --> 32:20.720
Bingo. These are all found
a hundred folders deep.

32:20.780 --> 32:23.000
The problem is,
if they really are from Russia,

32:23.060 --> 32:25.480
how do I prove that these girls
are under 16?

32:25.540 --> 32:28.680
I can either find one who's, like,
a five-year-old, beyond argument,

32:28.740 --> 32:32.680
or find one I can somehow identify.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.960
Well, let's hope
you find a five-year-old.

32:36.020 --> 32:39.120
Do I? Do I really hope that?

32:43.860 --> 32:46.920
Alex Moreno asserts that he knew
from the second message

32:46.980 --> 32:49.080
Caroline posted
that she was an adult.

32:49.140 --> 32:50.800
But what does his behaviour tell us?

32:50.860 --> 32:54.520
None of his subsequent emails
or text messages suggest that at all.

32:54.580 --> 32:57.760
In fact, every single one of them
implies the opposite.

32:57.820 --> 32:59.280
If he always thought
she was an adult,

32:59.340 --> 33:01.880
why didn't he say that
the minute he was picked up,

33:01.940 --> 33:03.400
or during his record of interview

33:03.460 --> 33:05.920
or at any stage
during the committal hearing?

33:05.980 --> 33:08.560
Innocent people
simply accept the world -

33:08.620 --> 33:10.320
they don't imagine deceit
or subterfuge.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.720
But if we are to believe
Mr Moreno here,

33:12.780 --> 33:15.360
all we are doing is revealing
our own innocence,

33:15.420 --> 33:16.920
because experience tells us

33:16.980 --> 33:19.440
he is making a desperate bid
to save himself.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.200
But the evidence of his guilt
is in every line of the transcript.

33:25.660 --> 33:27.000
Nothing further, Your Honour.

33:27.060 --> 33:29.880
Thank you, Madam Crown.

33:29.940 --> 33:32.800
I'll review the evidence
and deliver my judgement

33:32.860 --> 33:34.880
on a date to be confirmed.

33:37.060 --> 33:39.960
(Distant siren)

33:43.340 --> 33:47.240
So you talked to Gillies?
Yeah, I saw Tony.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.400
According to him,
we all share the same goal.

33:49.460 --> 33:50.480
Got to be seen to play fair

33:50.540 --> 33:52.640
and play our cards in a way
that keeps you out of jail.

33:52.700 --> 33:55.120
(Scoffs) I'll drink to that.

33:55.180 --> 33:57.800
It'd be much easier to do if the
old pisshead trusted me a bit more,

33:57.860 --> 33:59.760
but... it's OK.

34:00.900 --> 34:04.040
Good. So?

34:11.540 --> 34:13.280
The problem with
assisted suicide is,

34:13.340 --> 34:15.400
it admits an intention to kill.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.400
But there's a lack of evidence
supporting the assertion

34:17.460 --> 34:19.280
that Sally wanted to be killed.

34:19.340 --> 34:21.560
So then it starts
to sound like murder.

34:21.620 --> 34:25.760
There was never any intention.
It... it was accidental.

34:25.820 --> 34:28.280
That's right. That's their point.
Or our point.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.840
Their point?
Our point.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.639
What can I say?
I've got a foot in both camps.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.719
Anyway, as a cop,
looking at the scene,

34:34.780 --> 34:36.520
us cops can see what happened.

34:36.580 --> 34:38.679
It was an accident,
with unintended consequences

34:38.739 --> 34:41.040
that nonetheless
could have been foreseen

34:41.100 --> 34:42.639
if you hadn't have been
so emotional.

34:42.699 --> 34:45.600
Exactly. An accidental death.

34:45.659 --> 34:47.080
Right.

34:47.139 --> 34:50.600
The bummer is, to us lawyers,
that's called manslaughter.

34:50.659 --> 34:53.080
The good news, however, is...

34:53.139 --> 34:57.080
Well, it'll all be better if you...
plead guilty.

34:57.139 --> 35:00.440
Fuck off!

35:00.500 --> 35:04.440
Steve, if you fight it and lose it,
you WILL go to jail.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.240
Have you all gone fuckin' mad?
This is bullshit!

35:07.300 --> 35:11.840
My wife dies in my arms, and before
I can even scatter the ashes,

35:11.900 --> 35:13.240
I'm in the Coroner's court.

35:13.300 --> 35:15.960
And then some mad bitch
tells everyone I'm bent,

35:16.020 --> 35:18.840
and the good news, the good news,
is I've got to cop it!

35:20.700 --> 35:21.920
Fuck off!

35:30.980 --> 35:34.160
Who's running this prosecution?
Janet King.

35:34.220 --> 35:36.200
What about her?
Can we get to her somehow?

35:36.260 --> 35:38.360
She been shagging a postman
or something?

35:38.420 --> 35:39.440
She's gay.

35:39.500 --> 35:43.720
Surely that's still illegal
somewhere. Fuck, I don't know.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.600
Just give me her address
and a bottle of uppers,

35:48.660 --> 35:51.200
and I'll take care of it myself.

35:51.260 --> 35:52.200
Come on.

35:52.260 --> 35:55.640
I'm joking, Clive.
I'm just letting off steam.

35:57.940 --> 35:59.800
Nobody's wearing a wire, are they?

35:59.860 --> 36:03.840
No! Come on.
Please.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.960
Look, if you plead guilty
and you show remorse,

36:07.020 --> 36:09.280
it lets them argue
for a suspended sentence.

36:09.340 --> 36:12.760
And I wear a manslaughter conviction.
You stay free.

36:12.820 --> 36:15.160
I've still got to face myself, Owen.

36:20.380 --> 36:24.040
Just think about it, Steve, eh?
For all of us.

36:32.540 --> 36:35.280
JUDGE: Is your client
ready to enter a plea?

36:35.340 --> 36:37.200
Yes, Your Honour.

36:42.820 --> 36:47.560
For the charge of manslaughter,
how do you plead, Mr Blakely?

36:53.260 --> 36:55.160
Guilty, Your Honour.

36:55.220 --> 36:57.760
(Low murmurs)

37:00.980 --> 37:02.800
Is Wednesday clear, Counsel?

37:04.660 --> 37:07.000
As the court pleases.
Wednesday, then.

37:07.060 --> 37:10.720
I'll hear submissions
on sentencing at 10am.

37:10.780 --> 37:13.520
And given the unusual circumstances,
I am happy to continue

37:13.580 --> 37:16.720
with the current bail conditions
unless the Crown objects?

37:16.780 --> 37:18.440
No objection, Your Honour.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.920
The matter is adjourned
until Wednesday at ten.

37:20.980 --> 37:22.560
Bail to continue.

37:22.620 --> 37:26.360
(Reporters shout indistinctly)

37:26.420 --> 37:30.240
Heading back?
No, I've still got the Moreno case.

37:30.300 --> 37:33.320
Do you want me to start
on a draft for Blakely?

37:33.380 --> 37:35.200
What do you recommend?

37:35.260 --> 37:36.600
Well, if we want it suspended,

37:36.660 --> 37:41.520
maybe we should just ask for a year,
18 months?

37:41.580 --> 37:43.720
Man of fine character,
impeccable record.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.480
An act driven solely by love
for a terminally-ill wife.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.120
Do you think?
I could say it with feeling.

37:50.580 --> 37:53.520
Tatum.
Janet. Hi.

37:53.580 --> 37:55.480
Erin said that you went somewhere.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.640
Yeah, yeah, I'm down in Canberra
at the Commonwealth DPP.

37:58.700 --> 38:02.040
But we're up here for three or four
weeks for a big trafficking case.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.440
Sex?

38:04.500 --> 38:05.760
I mean the case?

38:05.820 --> 38:08.920
Is it sex trafficking or is it,
what, drugs, or guns...

38:08.980 --> 38:11.480
Yeah, it's sex.
Right.

38:11.540 --> 38:13.560
Do you have any time...
Anyway, I'm running late, so...

38:13.620 --> 38:15.720
Good luck.
Yeah, thanks. You too.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.680
So...

38:19.740 --> 38:20.760
What?

38:20.820 --> 38:24.040
Why did she leave?
Why should I know?

38:24.100 --> 38:27.200
I... I mean, I don't, obviously.

38:27.260 --> 38:29.880
Change of scenery,
better architecture.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.360
Who knows why women do anything.

38:31.420 --> 38:35.800
Some women. Young women.
Younger... women. Forget it.

38:35.860 --> 38:37.120
Ignore me.

38:39.540 --> 38:42.400
Do you know?
No. Don't ask me.

38:42.460 --> 38:45.400
I had six months out,
and when I came back, she'd left.

38:46.300 --> 38:49.560
And don't say it.
I knew you'd come back.

38:50.340 --> 38:51.920
I knew you'd say it.

38:56.220 --> 38:59.920
We must be mindful
that Mr Moreno's reputation

38:59.980 --> 39:01.720
both as husband and father,

39:01.780 --> 39:05.880
and as an artist,
has been on trial here.

39:05.940 --> 39:11.920
In the end, the crown case
relied on the absence of evidence.

39:11.980 --> 39:15.800
Nothing directly proves Mr Moreno
did know Sophie was really 27,

39:15.860 --> 39:19.160
so he must have believed
she was 13.

39:19.220 --> 39:22.640
Mr Moreno's argument,
on the other hand,

39:22.700 --> 39:27.120
rested on a real piece of evidence,
the word 'parents'.

39:27.180 --> 39:29.680
Plus, his rather convincing
explanation

39:29.740 --> 39:33.480
for why he kept his knowledge
of Sophie's real age to himself.

39:33.540 --> 39:39.240
Did Mr Moreno believe he was
communicating with a minor?

39:39.300 --> 39:44.040
Despite Madam Crown's
rather smug assertion

39:44.100 --> 39:45.960
that I will be outing myself

39:46.020 --> 39:50.160
as childishly innocent,
I am not persuaded he did.

39:50.220 --> 39:52.880
Therefore, the charge is not proven.

39:52.940 --> 39:56.320
Mr Moreno, I find you not guilty.
You are free to go.

39:56.380 --> 39:59.560
(Low murmur)

39:59.620 --> 40:01.360
COURT OFFICER: All rise.

40:17.900 --> 40:21.240
Don't worry, we'll get him,
sooner or later.

40:23.180 --> 40:25.440
'Mr Moreno's
convincing explanation.'

40:25.500 --> 40:27.240
Is that what Judge Renmark
called it?

40:27.300 --> 40:29.480
You could've asked for help.
I'm in the Sex Crimes Unit now.

40:29.540 --> 40:30.800
I know. I'm sorry.

40:30.860 --> 40:33.000
So I do know a bit about
the case law in this area.

40:33.060 --> 40:35.600
If we had time we would've asked,
but we only had an hour,

40:35.660 --> 40:38.040
and we thought we had to prepare
for a defence on the grounds of art.

40:38.100 --> 40:41.840
Which is no longer valid.
Oh, it's all changed.

40:41.900 --> 40:45.960
Legislation went through last June.
Art is no longer a defence.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.280
I didn't know.

40:47.340 --> 40:48.760
Not trying to be smart. Just saying.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.880
OK, let's debrief.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.760
Bad luck.
Was it?

40:53.940 --> 40:57.360
She lost.
I heard.

40:57.420 --> 40:59.280
I'm sure she's really very good,
though.

40:59.340 --> 41:02.480
Have I gone mad, or is that the most
perverse judgement you've ever heard?

41:02.540 --> 41:04.360
Ever?
We need to go over it. Copy it.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.440
Get a highlighter.
Why?

41:05.500 --> 41:08.280
'Cause we have to find an error.
Why? We can't do anything.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.680
The Attorney General can.

41:09.740 --> 41:11.920
In the House, move a motion,
take a vote, kick Renmark out.

41:11.980 --> 41:14.200
But he's retiring soon anyway.

41:14.260 --> 41:17.320
Still, it's pretty bloody
infuriating.

41:17.380 --> 41:19.520
That sleazy creep's
back out there now

41:19.580 --> 41:22.920
because a geriatric judge gave him
a get out of jail free card.

41:28.020 --> 41:30.560
Why wasn't that being heard
by a jury, anyway?

41:30.620 --> 41:32.240
They asked for a judge alone.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.920
No, they can't.
It had to be a jury trial.

41:34.980 --> 41:36.960
Yes, but we didn't object.
Why not?

41:37.020 --> 41:38.800
Because Tony told me not to.

41:38.860 --> 41:41.520
Renmark's a pro-Crown judge.
Or has been.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.680
So what happened today?
What was different? Me?

41:43.740 --> 41:46.440
I mean, sure, he didn't like me.
Yeah, I kinda got that.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.040
Was it something I said?
Is that what lost it?

41:50.340 --> 41:52.720
What?
Nothing.

41:52.780 --> 41:56.160
No, tell me. Was I really that smug?

41:56.220 --> 41:58.360
Or was he just getting lazy
and didn't want to write a judgement?

41:58.420 --> 42:00.160
What do you think happened?

42:00.220 --> 42:02.880
Well, it's as much me as you.
What is?

42:02.940 --> 42:06.520
Well, we were too busy trying
to guess what the defence would be.

42:06.580 --> 42:08.080
But the charge
had three elements to it.

42:08.140 --> 42:09.560
We should have just concentrated

42:09.620 --> 42:12.360
on making sure we were strong
on all three.

42:12.420 --> 42:15.520
Control your emotion
and go back to first principles.

42:15.580 --> 42:19.160
That's what you always used
to say... and we didn't.

42:26.180 --> 42:28.720
In summary, given the agreed facts,

42:28.780 --> 42:31.480
the Crown accepts that
Steven Blakely's motives

42:31.540 --> 42:35.440
were only to relieve
highly-distressing pain and anguish,

42:35.500 --> 42:38.880
and, as such, we do not seek
a term in custody...

42:38.940 --> 42:41.400
What are we doing here, Richard?

42:41.460 --> 42:43.400
Arguing for a suspended sentence,
I think, aren't we?

42:43.460 --> 42:44.960
Yes, but why?

42:46.540 --> 42:48.880
Put aside who Blakely is
for a moment,

42:48.940 --> 42:52.080
and let's relook at the facts
and the circumstances.

42:53.820 --> 42:55.480
Do they make that appropriate?

42:55.540 --> 42:58.360
Don't they?
Do they?

43:00.220 --> 43:03.480
(Sighs) Well, here are the facts.

43:03.540 --> 43:07.400
The autopsy report, the amount
of pain she would have been in,

43:07.460 --> 43:10.640
the dosage and frequency of drug use
over the previous month.

43:10.700 --> 43:12.440
Blakely's first statement
to the police,

43:12.500 --> 43:15.040
Maya and Drew's first statements.

43:15.100 --> 43:18.120
Three injections of morphine
in ten minutes.

43:35.540 --> 43:37.840
(Sighs)
They sleeping?

43:37.900 --> 43:40.480
Finally.
Oh, you look exhausted.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.600
What can I do?
Nothing.

43:42.660 --> 43:44.680
Go lie down. I'll join you in 20.

43:44.740 --> 43:47.280
Hmm. Don't work too late.

43:48.540 --> 43:51.680
(Mobile buzzes)

43:56.980 --> 43:59.000
RICHARD: Hey, sorry for the time.
Hope I didn't wake...

43:59.060 --> 44:00.760
Don't apologise for calling late.

44:00.820 --> 44:03.000
I wouldn't have answered
if I didn't want to talk.

44:03.060 --> 44:07.200
Thanks. Um, it's just...
Drew's credit card account.

44:07.260 --> 44:12.240
He had ordered those audio books
for his mum two days before.

44:12.300 --> 44:13.920
So?

44:13.980 --> 44:16.160
Doesn't that show
her intention to live?

44:16.220 --> 44:18.840
Maybe. Then.

44:18.900 --> 44:22.280
So you're still happy
asking for a suspended sentence?

44:22.340 --> 44:24.800
I... I don't mind. Just asking.

44:24.860 --> 44:29.000
People in palliative care can change
their outlook on life pretty quickly.

44:29.060 --> 44:31.000
If she declined rapidly
in the last few hours

44:31.060 --> 44:33.960
and he was there like he claims,
panicking, highly emotional,

44:34.020 --> 44:36.880
watching her writhe in agony,
maybe it's true.

44:38.780 --> 44:41.040
No-one else was there that day,
were they?

44:41.100 --> 44:44.360
When was the last time the nurse
was there? Was that the day before?

44:44.420 --> 44:47.640
Uh, you've got a report.
It's in the file.

44:47.700 --> 44:48.640
Um...

44:51.060 --> 44:52.440
OK, here it is.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.320
It was mid-morning on Tuesday.

44:59.260 --> 45:00.880
Tuesday?

45:04.700 --> 45:08.480
Your Honour, you cannot
give a terminally-ill patient

45:08.540 --> 45:10.360
that much morphine in ten minutes

45:10.420 --> 45:13.080
and look surprised
when it kills them.

45:13.140 --> 45:15.880
Even given the highly stressed
and emotional state

45:15.940 --> 45:19.680
the accused claims he was in,
somewhere in the back of his mind,

45:19.740 --> 45:23.120
he had to know death
was a real possibility.

45:23.180 --> 45:24.680
And even more tellingly,

45:24.740 --> 45:29.560
Steven Blakely hadn't called his
community nurse for three days.

45:29.620 --> 45:33.040
His wife is in increasing pain
and normally the greatest fear

45:33.100 --> 45:36.480
in that scenario is running out
of painkillers, and indeed, he was.

45:36.540 --> 45:38.640
So why on earth
didn't that concern him?

45:38.700 --> 45:41.760
Can we seriously believe
that was just an oversight?

45:41.820 --> 45:43.880
Under those circumstances, really?

45:45.100 --> 45:48.560
Your Honour, the Crown submits
it was because he must have known,

45:48.620 --> 45:54.080
somehow, consciously or otherwise,
she wasn't going to need any more.

45:54.140 --> 45:55.840
Steven Blakely's a public figure,

45:55.900 --> 45:58.160
in whom the public
had unconditional faith.

45:58.220 --> 45:59.520
This makes his actions,

45:59.580 --> 46:02.400
which were deliberately reckless,
even more appalling.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.400
He didn't order any more painkillers,

46:04.460 --> 46:06.360
and he gave Sally
three quick injections

46:06.420 --> 46:08.480
which were always going
to be potentially lethal.

46:08.540 --> 46:11.640
This was an act at the high end
of criminal negligence.

46:11.700 --> 46:14.120
The need for general deterrence
in this case

46:14.180 --> 46:16.400
is demonstrably grave and paramount.

46:16.460 --> 46:18.120
An immediate custodial sentence,

46:18.180 --> 46:19.600
in the upper range
of eight to ten years...

46:19.660 --> 46:20.920
What?!
..is the minimum

46:20.980 --> 46:23.040
that should be considered.
Bullshit.

46:23.100 --> 46:24.440
Thank you, Counsel.

46:24.500 --> 46:27.080
I will consider the issues raised

46:27.140 --> 46:30.120
and sentence the accused
tomorrow at 10am.

46:30.180 --> 46:31.960
COURT OFFICER: All rise.

46:41.300 --> 46:42.720
I had no idea.

46:44.420 --> 46:47.320
(Low murmurs)

46:50.340 --> 46:54.080
It was widely believed that
Assistant Commissioner Steven Blakely

46:54.140 --> 46:56.200
would receive a suspended sentence,

46:56.260 --> 47:00.200
but in a surprising turn,
Janet King, Senior Crown Prosecutor,

47:00.260 --> 47:04.160
argued persuasively
for a heavy custodial sentence.

47:04.220 --> 47:06.240
Others remain horrified
at the prospect

47:06.300 --> 47:09.320
of one of our best investigators
being jailed for nothing more

47:09.380 --> 47:12.360
than trying to alleviate the agony
of his dying wife.

47:12.420 --> 47:17.480
But Steven Blakely has robbed us
of any opportunity

47:17.540 --> 47:19.920
for one final act of love.

47:19.980 --> 47:22.400
He deserves what's coming to him.

47:22.460 --> 47:24.520
All we wanted was a chance
to say good...

47:26.540 --> 47:28.200
Did you know Janet
was going to say that?

47:28.260 --> 47:29.760
I'll defend her right to say it.

47:29.820 --> 47:31.120
Don't you have any control
over this place?

47:31.180 --> 47:32.760
You're the director,
the man in charge,

47:32.820 --> 47:34.240
who's supposed to put his stamp
on everything.

47:34.300 --> 47:35.720
So much for working together!
Don't you start!

47:35.780 --> 47:38.840
Make sure everyone tows the line
and proper results are achieved?!

47:38.900 --> 47:42.120
Can I just speak to her...
I don't want her on our cases!

47:42.180 --> 47:45.360
You don't get a say in it.
We have to work on our relationship.

47:45.420 --> 47:47.000
Well?
Read Drew's interview.

47:47.060 --> 47:50.120
And the autopsy, and the nurse's
report and look at the photos.

47:50.180 --> 47:52.400
What do you know about HIM, Janet?
You don't know him at all.

47:52.460 --> 47:54.520
Reports don't help you
understand a man.

47:54.580 --> 47:57.160
Is he really who you think he is?
Oh, for fuck's...

47:57.220 --> 47:59.360
Don't you tell me
who Steve Blakely is, please.

47:59.420 --> 48:01.520
I have worked with him for 20 years.

48:01.580 --> 48:04.040
You've been brainwashed by that
silly ranting Vasilich woman.

48:04.100 --> 48:05.600
No, I haven't.

48:05.660 --> 48:08.880
Oriana's murder is an entirely
different matter, anomalies and all.

48:08.940 --> 48:11.360
What's THAT meant to mean?
That's what this is about.

48:11.420 --> 48:14.320
I get it now. It's all about you.
Don't be ridiculous.

48:14.380 --> 48:16.680
She got taken to the cleaners
in the Moreno case,

48:16.740 --> 48:18.600
and your pride took a bit of a hit.

48:18.660 --> 48:20.360
So now you want to
salvage your reputation

48:20.420 --> 48:21.920
by sending Blakely to jail.

48:21.980 --> 48:23.480
Yeah, that'll show us
how tough you are.

48:23.540 --> 48:24.960
That'll show 'em you're back
to your best!

48:25.020 --> 48:26.440
To hell with fair play!

48:26.500 --> 48:28.680
To hell with teamwork
and natural justice!

48:28.740 --> 48:31.600
Christ, you selfish dyke!
Hey!

48:31.660 --> 48:33.760
I want an inquiry into her, Tony!
Come on, get out!

48:33.820 --> 48:35.480
Go on, get out!

48:35.540 --> 48:38.560
Oh, it's OK for her to send an
Assistant Commissioner to Long Bay,

48:38.620 --> 48:40.560
but I can't tell her
what I think about it?

48:40.620 --> 48:43.800
You know, is that what the culture
is around here now, huh?

48:43.860 --> 48:45.560
From the side of the fence
that I sit on, Tony,

48:45.620 --> 48:48.000
if you're gonna give attitude,
you've got to be able to take it!

48:51.660 --> 48:53.240
What?!

49:01.220 --> 49:03.720
Now, I apologise
for the personal insult, yeah.

49:03.780 --> 49:05.920
Obviously out of line,
and I'll put that in writing.

49:05.980 --> 49:09.160
But I won't back away from what
I said about her professionally.

49:17.660 --> 49:20.560
(Honking)

49:27.820 --> 49:30.320
Haven't you thrown the cat
among the pigeons.

49:31.540 --> 49:34.400
No choice.
The joys of appearance work.

49:35.540 --> 49:38.320
It's not for everyone, I suppose.

49:38.380 --> 49:41.200
No. Uh, they were in the kitchen.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.720
Thank you. If I'd forgot those,
I would have been in real trouble.

49:45.780 --> 49:46.880
How is Ash?

49:46.940 --> 49:50.320
It is generous of her to give up her
career for you and your children.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.240
All good?

49:54.300 --> 49:58.080
Yep. God bless modern refrigeration.
(Chuckles)

49:58.140 --> 49:59.400
No more bad apples.

49:59.460 --> 50:01.640
Yes, everyone thinks
that's such an advance, don't they?

50:01.700 --> 50:04.600
But even the ones that look good are
trouble, as Adam and Eve found out,

50:04.660 --> 50:07.680
so you never can tell really...
can you?

50:07.740 --> 50:10.080
What do you think of Owen Mitchell?

50:10.140 --> 50:13.560
Oh, actually, strike that question.

50:13.620 --> 50:16.680
It'd just be gossip and... no.

50:18.340 --> 50:21.080
Uh, a lot of the blogs
and commentaries this afternoon

50:21.140 --> 50:23.160
were swinging back
in Blakely's favour.

50:23.220 --> 50:26.200
'Why lock him up', 'happens every
day in cancer wards', etcetera,

50:26.260 --> 50:30.840
but for what it's worth,
I agree with you.

50:51.100 --> 50:54.480
What do you think he should get?
I don't know. I haven't followed it.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.680
No, but I mean as a gut feeling.
Like, which side are you on?

50:58.700 --> 51:00.240
Just call me neutral.

51:00.300 --> 51:03.080
Honestly, I've got enough problems
with my own work at the moment.

51:05.300 --> 51:08.200
Well, thanks for your support.

51:46.220 --> 51:49.800
# And I'm waiting for the day #
Bitch.

51:53.900 --> 51:57.640
# I know you've got your part

52:01.620 --> 52:04.760
# And I'm waiting for the day #

52:04.820 --> 52:07.640
Well?
Shouldn't be long now, Your Honour.

52:09.540 --> 52:13.280
# I know you'll have the heart

52:17.260 --> 52:20.360
# And I'm hoping that you'll say #
And?

52:20.420 --> 52:23.120
We're just trying to locate
Mr Blakely, Your Honour.

52:23.180 --> 52:25.880
Has anyone been in contact
with him this morning?

52:25.940 --> 52:27.120
Not as such, no.

52:27.180 --> 52:29.000
You've obviously tried calling him.

52:29.060 --> 52:30.920
Of course.
And gone to his house?

52:30.980 --> 52:32.080
No-one's answering.

52:32.140 --> 52:33.880
What exactly are you
telling me, Mr Schaeffer?

52:33.940 --> 52:36.080
He isn't there, he isn't here
and he's not answering his phone,

52:36.140 --> 52:38.640
and now we're half-an-hour late?

52:38.700 --> 52:41.960
He's bolted?
Uh, yes, Your Honour.

52:42.020 --> 52:45.160
Could be car trouble, um, traffic.

52:48.380 --> 52:49.960
I'm issuing a bench warrant

52:50.020 --> 52:52.360
for the immediate arrest
of Steven Blakely.

52:52.420 --> 52:55.600
Sergeant Downs, please contact
the Australian Federal Police

52:56.100 --> 52:57.680
and Australian Customs,
and instruct them

52:57.740 --> 53:00.280
to issue PASS alerts
on all sea and air borders.

53:00.340 --> 53:03.040
And circulate a description
of the car and the man

53:03.100 --> 53:06.520
to all relevant authorities
in all Australian jurisdictions.

53:06.580 --> 53:08.080
Steve?!

53:09.740 --> 53:11.160
Steve?

53:11.220 --> 53:16.480
# Hold on, what did you say that for?

53:35.260 --> 53:38.880
# And I'm waiting for the day #

53:40.140 --> 53:43.200
Whatever happens,
you can't blame Janet.

53:43.260 --> 53:45.680
It's never personal.

53:45.740 --> 53:48.760
Basically she's just
her own worst enemy.

53:48.820 --> 53:50.800
Not while I'm alive.

53:50.860 --> 53:54.880
# And I'm waiting for the day

54:00.420 --> 54:04.200
# What am I waiting for?

54:05.420 --> 54:11.160
# Hold on, what did you say that for?

54:12.980 --> 54:18.000
# Hold on,
what did you say that for? #

54:18.060 --> 54:20.280
(Mobile buzzes)

54:22.100 --> 54:25.840
Janet King.
It's Andy.

54:25.900 --> 54:29.400
He left a message on his computer.
What?

54:29.460 --> 54:32.240
It just says,
'please forgive me'.

54:32.300 --> 54:34.880
# What did you say that for? #

54:45.300 --> 54:48.200
If anyone has seen my father,

54:48.260 --> 54:50.280
please get in touch with the police.

54:50.340 --> 54:54.200
Find him. Dead or alive. I want
speed, I want professionalism,

54:54.260 --> 54:55.560
I want a result.

54:55.620 --> 54:57.040
So, what have we got?

54:57.100 --> 54:58.760
Car's unlocked,
keys under the front seat,

54:58.820 --> 55:01.720
no obvious blood, no obvious damage
to the interior of the car or boot.

55:01.780 --> 55:04.600
But this car is parked outside
Blakely's house

55:04.660 --> 55:07.360
and the neighbour heard a female
voice yelling outside the door

55:07.420 --> 55:08.440
about 7:00PM.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.320
That's a woman.
Who is she?

55:10.380 --> 55:13.120
I don't like you questioning me
and my work in front of a witness.

55:13.180 --> 55:14.440
You totally intimidated her.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.880
I've just secured the assistance
of an eye-witness in a murder case

55:16.940 --> 55:18.680
while you've been fluffing around,
making cups of tea.
