00:07.166 --> 00:09.375
Yoo-hoo! Donald!

00:09.375 --> 00:11.125
What are you guys doing here?

00:11.125 --> 00:14.125
We came to see my captain in action.

00:14.125 --> 00:16.375
You always said you'd
take us sailing some day.

00:16.375 --> 00:19.083
And today's the perfect day.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.625
But, but, but...

00:25.291 --> 00:28.208
Ha-ha. First mate
Mickey reporting for duty.

00:28.208 --> 00:32.000
Batten down the hatches!
Set sail for adventure!

00:32.000 --> 00:35.375
Shiver me timbers, you're
not looking so good, captain.

00:36.792 --> 00:39.166
What do you mean you
don't know how to sail?

00:41.250 --> 00:43.542
Look, Daisy bought me this suit.

00:43.542 --> 00:47.000
I only wear it because
she loves a man in uniform.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.041
If she finds out I can't sail,

00:49.041 --> 00:50.166
it's over!

00:50.166 --> 00:52.041
You've gotta help me, Mickey!

00:52.041 --> 00:54.041
Don't worry, pal, just
pull yourself together.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.208
Now the first thing we gotta do

00:55.208 --> 00:56.834
is tie the boat back up to the...

00:58.250 --> 00:59.750
Uh-oh.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.542
Okay. Don't panic. Just fly
up there and open the sail.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.917
Yeah, no, you can just...
Just stop.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.166
You pedal and I'll steer.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.166
Uh-oh.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.125
Wow! Attaboy, Donald!

01:26.125 --> 01:27.583
Donald?

01:30.208 --> 01:31.542
Hold on, Donald!

01:41.125 --> 01:44.000
Way to go! Now pull that
rope and release the sail!

01:44.500 --> 01:46.917
Donald!

01:47.208 --> 01:49.083
You're so brave!

01:49.458 --> 01:52.083
Didn't I tell you?
He's the best sailor.

01:52.083 --> 01:55.125
No, you said that if he keeps
up with the lies and tantrums,

01:55.125 --> 01:56.125
he can go fly a kite.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.250
Uh-huh, plus he's the best sailor.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.000
Show 'em what you've got, sweetie!

02:08.500 --> 02:10.625
You did it!
I did?

02:13.875 --> 02:15.709
I did it! Woo-hoo!

02:26.709 --> 02:28.625
Donald!

02:31.041 --> 02:32.208
Whoa, boy.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.125
Whoa!

03:10.125 --> 03:13.375
I knew you'd save us, captain Donald!

03:14.208 --> 03:17.792
But my shirt, it's ruined.

03:18.041 --> 03:20.166
Oh, I've got other uniforms.

03:21.417 --> 03:23.000
Pilot Donald.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.834
Ha! Get ready
for take-off.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.959
Wow! You can
fly a plane?

03:27.959 --> 03:29.375
No!
