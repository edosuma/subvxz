03:47.560 --> 03:51.473
- You're looking good, Dutch.
- It's been a long time, General.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.755
Come on inside.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.312
18 hours ago, we lost a chopper...
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide

03:58.400 --> 04:00.436
from this charming little country.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.310
We've got a transponder fixed
on their position... about here.

04:06.800 --> 04:11.351
This cabinet minister, does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

04:12.640 --> 04:17.269
Apparently, they strayed off course.
We're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.909
So why don't you use the regular army?
What do you need us for?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.197
Cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.148
Dillon.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.310
You son of a bitch.

04:40.920 --> 04:46.313
What's the matter? The CIA got you
pushing too many pencils?

04:49.560 --> 04:52.438
- Had enough?
- Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.077
- Never did know when to quit.
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.029
- What is this fucking tie business?
- Forget about my tie.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.556
I heard about that job you pulled off in Berlin.
Very nice, Dutch.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.279
- Good old days.
- Yeah, like the good old days.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.636
- Then how come you passed on Libya?
- That wasn't my style.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.995
You got no style, Dutch. You know that.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.469
Come on. Why'd you pass?

05:20.920 --> 05:24.754
We're a rescue team, not assassins.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.918
Now, what we gotta do?

05:29.160 --> 05:32.516
That cabinet minister
is important to our scope of operations.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.593
A couple of our friends are about to
get squeezed and we can't let that happen.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.998
We need the best. That's why you're here.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.595
- Go on.
- Simple setup. One-day operation.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.913
We pick up their trail at the chopper,
grab those hostages, and bounce back.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.796
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm goin' in with you, Dutch.

05:55.280 --> 05:59.432
General, my team always works alone.
You know that.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.720
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.

06:02.800 --> 06:08.158
Once you reach your objective, Dillon will
evaluate the situation and take charge.

07:10.880 --> 07:15.078
<i>Delta One-Zero to Two Leader.</i>

07:15.160 --> 07:18.675
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.196
- AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.
- Who's our backup?

07:22.280 --> 07:24.840
No such thing. This is a one-way ticket.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.230
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.516
This is getting better by the minute.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.595
Billy!

07:49.680 --> 07:52.990
Billy! The other day
I went up to my girlfriend. I said,

07:53.080 --> 07:55.389
"You know, I'd like a little pussy."

07:55.480 --> 07:58.552
She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house."

08:00.160 --> 08:02.720
You see, she wanted
a littler one cos hers was...

08:05.120 --> 08:07.236
big as a house.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.592
Get that stinkin' shit out of my face.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.274
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.477
This stuff'll make you
a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,

08:24.560 --> 08:26.278
just like me.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.669
Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.832
That was in '72. Me and Dutch both got one.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.515
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.435
<i>You got it, Leader.</i>

09:38.520 --> 09:41.717
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.268
You never were that smart.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.669
Hawkins, you're up.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.715
<i>Lines away.</i>

12:38.280 --> 12:43.400
The pilots have been shot in the head.
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.916
- Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
- There's something else, Major.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.036
This is no ordinary army taxi.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.317
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.075
- Pick up the trail yet?
- Billy's on it.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.995
Heat seeker, Dillon. Pretty sophisticated
for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.719
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.836
There were 12 guerrillas.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.356
They took the two men from the helicopter,
but there's something else.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.599
- What do you mean?
- Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.798
They came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.115
Mean anything to you?

13:22.200 --> 13:26.796
Probably just another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.958
Get ahead and see what you can find.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.359
What's he got?

14:01.440 --> 14:04.671
Same business. Guerrillas hauling
two guys from the chopper,

14:04.760 --> 14:07.558
followed by men with American equipment.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.596
Do you remember Afghanistan?

14:09.680 --> 14:12.877
Trying to forget it. Come on.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.678
Holy mother of God.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.396
Jim Hopper.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.749
Mac, cut 'em down.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.031
I knew these men.

16:19.120 --> 16:23.079
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.
What the hell were they doing here?

16:23.160 --> 16:26.197
I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.078
Nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.835
- They shouldn't have been here.
- Somebody sent them.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.232
The guerrillas skinned them?

16:39.320 --> 16:41.754
Why did they skin them?

16:42.680 --> 16:45.194
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.835
- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.434
There was a firefight.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.592
They were shooting in all directions.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.989
I can't believe Hopper
walked into an ambush.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.753
I don't believe he did.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.957
I can't find a single track.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.032
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What about the rest of Hopper's men?

17:11.119 --> 17:13.588
There's no sign, sir.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.830
They never left here.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.717
It's like they just disappeared.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.959
Stick with the guerrilla trail.
Let's get the hostages.

17:27.040 --> 17:31.079
We move, five-metre spread. No sound.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.671
It's time to let old painless out the bag.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.270
Payback time.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.474
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker.
I don't care who you are back in the world.

19:11.560 --> 19:17.032
You give our position one more time,
I'll bleed you, real quiet, and leave you here.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.190
Got that?

20:31.720 --> 20:33.711
Fuck you.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.988
He killed one of the hostages. We move.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.071
Mac, Blain - the nest.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.833
Billy, Poncho - the guard.
Hawkins, Dillon - backup.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.230
As soon as they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.791
One down.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.230
What the hell's he doin'?

23:22.240 --> 23:25.038
What the fuck...?

23:34.320 --> 23:36.311
Showtime, kid.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.755
Target's the centre of the palapa.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.155
Dutch, on your nine.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.350
Get that mother.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.992
Stick around.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.590
Hostages inside.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.559
Knock, knock.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.633
I got 'em.

26:36.720 --> 26:41.316
Hawkins, call in position and situation.
Get Con Op on the hook.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.311
You got it, Major.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.590
Shit.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.195
Mac. Any sign of the other hostage?

26:56.280 --> 27:01.593
Found the other guy - he's dead, too -
and the gear from the chopper.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.831
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.

27:04.920 --> 27:09.471
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was
CIA. Another thing, Major. We were lucky.

27:09.560 --> 27:13.712
Other guys they waxed...
were Russian military advisers.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.995
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.640
Good work, Mac. Clear the area. No traces.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.359
Get the men ready to move.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.190
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

27:32.280 --> 27:36.193
- You're hit. You're bleedin', man.
- I ain't got time to bleed.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.954
You got time to duck?

27:51.320 --> 27:53.629
This is goddamn beautiful.

27:57.040 --> 28:02.068
Goddamn jackpot.
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.674
We got those bastards.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.676
- We got 'em.
- I think this is what you're looking for.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.912
You set us up. It's all bullshit. All of it.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.993
The cabinet minister, the whole business.
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.709
We stopped a major invasion.
In three days they'd have crossed the border.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.156
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

28:25.240 --> 28:29.995
- You're pissed about the cover story.
- So, what story did you hand to Hopper?

28:30.080 --> 28:34.790
We've been looking for this place for months.
My men were in that chopper when it got hit.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.919
- Hopper went in and he disappeared.
- He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.560
I had to get somebody
who could crack these bastards.

28:41.640 --> 28:45.952
So you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.833
What happened to you, Dillon?

28:50.920 --> 28:53.673
You used to be somebody I could trust.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.035
I woke up.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.350
Why don't you?

28:58.440 --> 29:00.351
You're an asset,

29:00.440 --> 29:02.954
an expendable asset,

29:03.040 --> 29:06.874
and I used you to get the job done. Got it?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.434
My men are not expendable.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.950
And I don't do this kind of work.

29:16.040 --> 29:20.750
Major, we stepped into some real shit here.

29:20.840 --> 29:25.516
We've got guerrillas all over the place.
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.636
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.952
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- She goes with us. She's too valuable.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.918
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets. No deal.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.150
You're still under orders, Major.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.959
Now, you wanna make that call or should I?

29:41.280 --> 29:44.636
She's your baggage.
You fall behind and you're on your own.

29:53.320 --> 29:57.359
This place is too hot for a pickup. They won't
touch us till we get over the border.

29:57.440 --> 30:02.434
Billy. Give me a way out of this hole.
Aerial says we are cut off.

30:02.520 --> 30:06.115
The only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.668
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.751
Not much choice.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.798
Poncho, take lead. Double-time it.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.714
Dillon.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.151
Over here.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.269
- Turn around.
- Why?

31:03.920 --> 31:05.273
Thanks.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.631
Any time.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.671
Billy.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.192
The other day
I was goin' down on my girlfriend.

31:20.280 --> 31:24.398
I said to her, "Jeez, you've got a big pussy.
Jeez, you've got a big pussy."

31:24.480 --> 31:27.916
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"
I said, "I didn't."

31:29.440 --> 31:33.115
See, it was cos of the echo.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.349
Over here.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.598
Turn around.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.675
Turn around. Over here.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.359
Any time.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.434
Any time.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.838
Goddamn.

35:10.560 --> 35:13.358
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.830
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man,
but nothin' like this.

35:16.920 --> 35:21.232
I hear you. This shit's somethin'.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.596
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

35:24.680 --> 35:28.434
Hey, a little taste of home.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.349
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

35:43.240 --> 35:46.869
Come on. Stop sandbaggin' it. Now, get up.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.679
Come on, get up. Would you get up?

35:59.400 --> 36:02.517
Maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.832
Try it again... please.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.715
What's got Billy so spooked?

37:16.800 --> 37:18.756
Can't say, Major.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.434
Been acting squirrely all morning.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.876
That damn nose of his... it's weird.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.991
What is it?

38:09.280 --> 38:10.918
Billy...

38:13.320 --> 38:16.312
What the hell is wrong with you?

38:19.560 --> 38:22.233
There's something in those trees.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.708
Do you see anything?

38:59.800 --> 39:01.791
Up there.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.031
Nothing.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.710
What do you think?

39:13.120 --> 39:15.680
I guess it's nothing, Major.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.554
Please.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.198
Please.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.512
Billy, break left.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.431
Mac, right.

41:25.520 --> 41:29.752
- What the...? This isn't her blood.
- What the hell'd you do to him?

41:29.840 --> 41:32.832
Major... you'd better take a look at this.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.831
Did you find Hawkins?

41:34.920 --> 41:36.478
I...

41:36.560 --> 41:38.676
I can't tell.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.440
What in God's name...?

41:57.520 --> 41:59.636
I think it's Hawkins.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.759
- Where the hell is his body?
- There's no sign of it.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.639
Ask her what happened.

42:27.880 --> 42:31.270
She says the jungle...
it just came alive and took him.

42:31.360 --> 42:34.477
Bullshit. That's not what she said.

42:35.160 --> 42:38.152
- It doesn't make sense.
- Those sappers have followed us...

42:38.240 --> 42:40.834
They've been in front of us. This woman...

42:41.600 --> 42:43.192
Hold it.

42:43.280 --> 42:47.637
Hold it. Why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?

42:47.720 --> 42:50.109
Why didn't she escape?

42:52.600 --> 42:54.716
- Hopper.
- What?

42:56.800 --> 43:00.634
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.313
I want Hawkins' body found. Sweep pattern.
Double back. 50 metres. Let's go.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.955
Come on in, you fuckers.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.517
Come on in.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.989
Old painless is waitin'.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.995
Sergeant.

45:37.920 --> 45:40.354
Motherfucker.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.876
- What happened?
- I saw it.

47:09.960 --> 47:12.155
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.911
Blain.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.629
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

47:34.720 --> 47:40.113
The wound's all fused, cauterised.
What the hell could have done this to a man?

47:40.200 --> 47:41.679
Mac.

47:41.760 --> 47:44.354
Mac, look at me.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.477
- Who did this?
- I don't know, goddamn it.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.233
I saw something.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.388
Not a thing. Not a fuckin' trace.

47:55.480 --> 47:58.836
No blood, no bodies. We hit nothing.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.754
Dillon, better get on the radio.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.111
Mac.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.437
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

48:15.520 --> 48:20.435
I want a defensive position above that ridge
mined with everything we've got.

48:21.840 --> 48:25.719
- Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.
- I got him.

49:27.320 --> 49:30.995
Major, I set up flares, frags and claymores.

49:31.440 --> 49:34.750
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.

49:35.160 --> 49:37.151
Thank you, Sergeant.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.912
Mac.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.153
He was a good soldier.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.231
He was...

49:48.200 --> 49:50.191
my friend.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.716
Goodbye, bro.

52:00.720 --> 52:04.952
Blazer One, I repeat, extraction necessary.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.395
Say again, Blazer One. Say again.

52:07.480 --> 52:11.598
<i>Request for extraction denied.</i>
<i>Area is still compromised.</i>

52:11.680 --> 52:17.391
<i>Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner</i>
<i>extraction. Priority, out. Next contact 0930.</i>

52:17.480 --> 52:20.392
Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours.

52:20.480 --> 52:22.471
Damn bastards.

52:22.560 --> 52:25.438
They say we're still in too far.
They can't risk coming in.

52:25.520 --> 52:28.830
We're assets, Dillon. Expendable assets.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.434
It comes with the job. I can accept it.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.080
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.954
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.433
Sergeant?

52:45.520 --> 52:47.909
Sergeant. Who hit us today?

52:48.960 --> 52:50.598
I don't know.

52:50.680 --> 52:54.229
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.515
He was there.

52:56.600 --> 52:58.830
Those eyes disappeared.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.831
What was that?

53:00.920 --> 53:02.717
Those eyes, they...

53:02.800 --> 53:04.677
they disappeared.

53:05.400 --> 53:09.188
I know one thing, Major.
I drew and fired straight at it.

53:09.280 --> 53:13.671
Capped off 200 rounds
in the Minigun... Full pack.

53:13.760 --> 53:17.673
Nothing... nothing on this earth
could have lived.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.035
Not at that range.

53:23.440 --> 53:27.718
Mac, you take first watch,
then you get some rest.

53:28.800 --> 53:33.669
Ask her. Ask her what she saw.
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

53:34.080 --> 53:36.594
Go ahead. Ask her.

53:44.760 --> 53:49.675
She says the same fuckin' thing.
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

53:49.760 --> 53:53.275
Billy... you know something. What is it?

53:54.400 --> 53:58.757
- I'm scared, Poncho.
- Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.671
There's something out there waiting for us,

54:03.640 --> 54:05.676
and it ain't no man.

54:13.640 --> 54:15.915
We're all gonna die.

54:18.200 --> 54:22.990
He's losing his cool. There's a couple of
guys out there and we gotta take 'em down.

54:23.080 --> 54:26.038
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

54:26.120 --> 54:30.079
Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper,

54:30.160 --> 54:32.469
and now it wants us.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.998
Here we are again, bro,

54:40.080 --> 54:42.435
just you and me.

54:42.520 --> 54:45.751
Same kind of moon and same kind ofjungle.

54:45.840 --> 54:48.718
Real number 10 night, remember?

54:48.800 --> 54:53.430
Whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.

54:53.520 --> 54:57.354
Nobody else. Right on top, bro.

54:58.360 --> 55:02.717
Not a scratch. Not a fuckin' scratch.
You know, whoever got you,

55:02.800 --> 55:07.954
he'll come back again, and when he does,
I'm gonna cut your name right into him.

55:08.040 --> 55:11.555
I'm gonna cut your name into him.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.870
Mac.

55:34.280 --> 55:36.271
- This way.
- Where the hell are you?

55:36.360 --> 55:38.351
Where are you?

55:50.800 --> 55:52.950
Where are you?

55:55.760 --> 55:58.320
Mac, where are you?

55:59.880 --> 56:01.233
Jesus.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.436
I got you, motherfucker.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.875
I killed you, you fuck.

56:05.960 --> 56:08.997
Jesus. You killed a pig.

56:09.080 --> 56:11.878
Do you think you could have found
something bigger?

56:11.960 --> 56:14.758
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

56:16.240 --> 56:19.630
- Where's the girl?
- Shit.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.839
Why wasn't anybody watching her?

56:26.600 --> 56:29.114
Why didn't she try to get away?

56:29.200 --> 56:32.510
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

56:32.600 --> 56:35.910
Major, you better take a look at this.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.112
Blain's body, it's gone.

56:44.200 --> 56:46.509
It came in through the tripwires.

56:46.600 --> 56:49.910
Took it right out from under our noses.

57:02.040 --> 57:07.114
That boar had to set off the trip flare, Major,
cos there ain't no other tracks.

57:07.200 --> 57:11.512
How could anyone get through this
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

57:11.600 --> 57:14.717
And why didn't he try and kill one of us?

57:14.800 --> 57:17.712
He came in to get the body.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.950
He's killing us one at a time.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.395
Like a hunter.

57:38.040 --> 57:41.157
He's using the trees.

57:50.600 --> 57:53.353
Yesterday, what did you see?

57:53.440 --> 57:56.796
- You're wasting your time.
- No more games.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.319
I don't know what it was.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.150
- It...
- Go on.

58:05.240 --> 58:08.198
It changed colours like the chameleon.

58:08.280 --> 58:10.669
It uses the jungle.

58:10.760 --> 58:13.991
Are you sayin' Blain and Hawkins were killed
by a fuckin' lizard?

58:14.080 --> 58:19.598
That's a bullshit psych job. There's two
or three men at the most. Fucking lizard.

58:21.680 --> 58:24.240
- What's your name?
- Anna.

58:29.400 --> 58:34.110
Anna, this thing is hunting us. All of us.

58:35.240 --> 58:37.071
You know that.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.314
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need everyone.

58:42.400 --> 58:45.517
- I'm taking her back. We're out of here.
- We're not going yet.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.717
The rendezvous is 10 miles away.
You think the chopper'll wait?

58:48.800 --> 58:53.590
Dillon, we make a stand now, or there will be
nobody left to go to the chopper.

58:53.680 --> 58:56.035
There is something else.

58:56.120 --> 58:59.829
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

58:59.920 --> 59:02.514
Its blood was on the leaves.

59:02.600 --> 59:05.398
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.268
Look out.

59:52.920 --> 59:56.435
You really think
this boy-scout bullshit's gonna work.

59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.195
It can see our tripwires.
Maybe it can't see this.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.590
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.588
What makes you think
he'll come in through here?

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.231
There are tripwires on every tree for 50 yards.
This is the only way in.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.068
When I was little, we found a man.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.071
He looked like,

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.151
like, butchered.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.754
The old women in the village
crossed themselves

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.230
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.192
Only in the hottest years this happens.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.831
And this year it grows hot.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.398
We begin finding our men.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.836
We found them sometimes without their skin,

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.117
and sometimes much, much worse.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:17.477
<i>"El que hace trofeos de los hombres"</i> means
"the demon who makes trophies of man."

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.077
So, what you gonna try next? Cheese?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.909
Hey, Dutch!

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.833
Shit.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.549
Got you, motherfucker. I got you.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.431
I'm coming.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:37.116
Mac. Mac. Get Ramirez on his feet
and get to the chopper.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.272
- Hold it. I'm going after Mac.
- That's not your style, Dillon.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.069
I picked up some bad habits from you.
Get your people the hell outta here.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.754
You can't win this, Dillon.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.593
Maybe I can get even.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.031
Dillon.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.351
Just hold on to that damn chopper.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.549
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.077
- I can make it. I can make it.
- Get the radio. Forget the rest.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.835
Come on, Poncho.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.392
Long tall Sally

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.072
She's built sweet

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.357
She got everything that Uncle John need

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.271
Oh, baby

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.868
Baby

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.315
I'm gonna have me some fun

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.630
I'm gonna have me some fun

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.231
Turn around.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.591
Over here.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.031
Over here.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.071
Mac?

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.154
Out there. Past them trees.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.237
You see it?

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.355
I see you.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.551
I see it.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.271
I see it.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.911
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.
You work your way down there toward him.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.753
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.
When I flush that son of a bitch, you nail him.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.559
I got a score to settle.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.996
We've both got scores to settle.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.073
Come on. Quickly. Hurry up.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.118
Don't. Leave it.
It didn't kill you because you weren't armed.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.191
No sport.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.519
Mac.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.519
Any time.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.474
Let's go.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.591
Billy.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.389
Billy, let's go.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.991
Give me the weapon.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.115
No.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.997
Run.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.230
Run.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.639
Go.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.871
Get to the chopper.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.477
Oh, shit.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.750
He couldn't see me.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.871
Bleed, bastard.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.631
You're one ugly motherfucker.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.560
Bad idea.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.238
Come on.

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:07.075
Come on. Do it.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.151
Do it.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.158
Come on. Come on.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.152
Kill me. I'm here. Kill me.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.551
I'm here. Kill me.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.438
Come on. Kill me. I'm here.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.557
Come on. Do it now. Kill me.

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.515
What the hell are you?

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:51.154
What the hell are you?

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.955
What the...?

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.035
My God.
