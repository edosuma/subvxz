WEBVTT

00:01.839 --> 00:05.799
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:05.840 --> 00:08.832
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:08.880 --> 00:13.396
<i>Cos I'm in hell.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:24.948
'OK, here we go, wedding day,
I'm heading for a wedding.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.915
'How do I feel?
Empty? Check. Scared? Check.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.394
'AIone? Check.

00:32.439 --> 00:35.318
'Just another ordinary day. (Chuckles)

00:35.360 --> 00:37.555
'Very funny.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.991
'Oh, great. I didn't expect
a freshly ironed shirt, but him? '

00:42.040 --> 00:46.750
Super Hans, it's my wedding day.
I need to get into my bathroom.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.518
All right, keep your wig on.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.279
- God, Jeremy, this place is disgusting.
- I know.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.788
A pretty amazing
unofficial stag night, yeah?

00:53.840 --> 00:56.195
I'm so glad I didn't attend
almost any of it.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.515
Did you slink off to bed
before we did the melon-off?

00:58.560 --> 01:00.710
I believe so. What exactly is?

01:00.760 --> 01:03.274
Two guys get hard-ons,
they put melons on their dicks,

01:03.320 --> 01:04.958
first melon to fall off loses.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.310
Right and who won - Gore Vidal
or Doctor Jonathan Miller?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.952
Is that? Nancy stayed?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.913
Yup. Lovely clean Nancy
all over our filthy, horrible sofa.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.475
Things are looking up.
Right, the farewell breakfast.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.875
I'm making you the last breakfast.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.150
Shit! The last breakfast.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.760
Yup. Sit down, I'm making toast.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.758
One brown, one white.
White's the pudding, yeah?

01:27.800 --> 01:29.028
That's right.

01:31.080 --> 01:35.278
Oh, one of Super Hans's quite menacing
friends started burning faces

01:35.320 --> 01:38.437
in the Mighty White with cigarettes,
so that's all gone,

01:38.480 --> 01:42.758
but how about
a cream cracker and a Ryvita?

01:42.800 --> 01:45.792
- A cream cracker and a Ryvita?
- Bit the same.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.478
That's my wedding breakfast.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.272
No, OK, sorry.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.515
Well, I'll just run out and get us

01:51.560 --> 01:53.630
some coffees and croissants
and freshly squeezed OJ.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.477
- Really?
- Well...

01:55.520 --> 01:58.193
I haven't got very much cash
at the moment and no-one round here

01:58.240 --> 02:01.949
really does that sort of thing,
but I would, if you wanted.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.231
I mean, I will. I mean,
obviously I can't, but I would.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.998
That's very kind, Jez.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.836
Hey, Nance, how was the sofa?

02:08.880 --> 02:12.953
Oh, fine. Super Hans tried to
sexually assault me a couple of times,

02:13.000 --> 02:14.911
but I told him where to get off.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.598
Super Hans.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.629
< Sorry.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.955
So, looking forward to the wedding?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.390
Oh, right. Listen, Mark,
I'm gonna have to miss it, I'm sorry.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.192
Oh, right, OK.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.232
Why are you not coming, Nance?
Too many memories?

02:28.280 --> 02:32.671
- What?
- Of us, of our wedding, when we got married.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.676
Oh, shit, I forgot we got married.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.871
I'm always forgetting that.
It is so weird that we got married.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.469
I know, I forget too, sometimes.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.796
My dad's just in town, he wants me
to move back to the States.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.671
Said he's gonna buy me
a condo and a boat.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.033
'Shit, it's happening, she's out of
my life forever. What am I gonna do?

02:52.080 --> 02:55.675
'Could pretend it's not happening.
That's worked for everything else.'

02:55.720 --> 03:00.157
Nancy, don't have the melon.
That's not good melon.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.990
Right, so, listen, Mark,
you must be so excited?

03:07.040 --> 03:08.996
Yup, yeah, a very exciting day.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.476
You're gonna be married to Sophie
for the rest of your life.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.919
No need to rub it in, Nance.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.632
It's such a big commitment.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.398
Well, not really.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.954
But if you love each other,
then it's massive.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.672
Fine, no, I agree, it's great.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.793
It's massive, I'm really looking forward
to it, all right, satisfied?

03:25.840 --> 03:28.400
Bit tense, wedding nerves.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.591
Right, well, I'm gonna freshen up
before I hit the road.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.874
Jez, I need to have
a look over your speech.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.273
What?

03:37.320 --> 03:39.151
The best man's speech,
I need to fact check it.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.952
No, I don't think so, mate.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.070
I don't mind it being risque, Jeremy.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.190
I just wanna make sure it's accurate.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.516
Also I will veto any jokes
about mucus, vomit or excrement.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.549
I don't really want to.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.115
Come on, Jez, I'm feeling very tense
and nervous and unhappy

03:53.160 --> 03:55.913
and I think maybe worrying about
your speech is the reason why.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.234
That isn't why.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.191
Yes, well, can I please just see it?

03:59.240 --> 04:03.199
Well, no, cos the truth is,
there is no speech.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.151
- What?
- Oh, come on, mate.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.794
We both know you're not
gonna marry Sophie today.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.149
It's making you tense,
nervous and unhappy.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.351
You'll stay here with me. I don't make you
tense, nervous or unhappy.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.108
- Yes, you do.
- Not to nearly the same extent.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.516
And what's gonna happen to me?
I mean, Nancy's going back to America.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.357
I mean, am I gonna live here,
like, on my own?

04:22.400 --> 04:23.992
Who am I gonna go to the pub with?

04:24.040 --> 04:29.319
Who's gonna do the forms for, like,
the TV and the gas and the water? Me?

04:29.360 --> 04:31.590
Don't you see?
None of this works, Mark.

04:31.640 --> 04:38.318
Look, Jez, it's my wedding day
and you need to write a speech

04:38.360 --> 04:40.828
cos I am going to get married.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.313
BANG

04:42.360 --> 04:43.713
Oh, shit, Nancy's in the bog.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.558
Jez, I'm gonna puke,
where do you want me to do it?

04:46.600 --> 04:48.750
RETCHING

04:48.800 --> 04:49.994
Oooh.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.189
Sorry, dude.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.872
OK, so I thought I'd start with,
"I will now do my best to give Mark

05:00.920 --> 05:03.593
"the six most uncomfortable
minutes of his life,

05:03.640 --> 05:06.359
"and the six most uncomfortable
minutes of Sophie's life

05:06.400 --> 05:08.470
"will be coming up later,
courtesy of Mark."

05:08.520 --> 05:09.748
I don't like it at all.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.836
It sounds like I'm gonna attack her.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.950
It does not sound like
you're going to attack her.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.434
No, Jez, it's blue, put something else.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.233
Well, I'd have to pay
for another opening joke.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.840
Pay? Jeremy, is that from the internet?

05:21.880 --> 05:24.269
Are you doing my speech
from the internet?

05:24.320 --> 05:26.914
Yeah, that was a risque icebreaker.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.474
Would you prefer
a conservative icebreaker?

05:29.520 --> 05:32.557
Yes, that sounds perfect.
Now, can we please get going?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.478
I've allowed us a generous
four hours to get to the church,

05:35.520 --> 05:38.557
but I don't want to eat into our
margin of safety by yakking here.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.990
Ok, I'll do conservative icebreaker.
Met at college material,

05:42.040 --> 05:45.999
couple of middle of the road inebriation
gags, bang... I'm out of there.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.634
Good. You know,
I actually find it quite comforting

05:48.680 --> 05:52.514
that our entire relationship can be
reduced to an online speech template.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.358
I mean, Kenneth Halliwell
and Joe Orton couldn't do that.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.393
(Groaning) Oh, fucking hell.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.998
Is he gonna be OK?

06:01.040 --> 06:03.759
Oh, yeah, he's on the dry heaves,
so the upholstery should be fine.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.360
I don't think he'll die,
he never normally dies.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.311
Are you all right, Super Hans?

06:08.360 --> 06:09.554
RETCHING

06:09.600 --> 06:11.431
Got most of it in a shoe.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.631
My shoe, my wedding shoe!
First my hat and now my shoe.

06:14.680 --> 06:19.231
You said you were on the dry heaves.
That was a wetty.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.032
I'm gonna puke again, Jez, pull over.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.911
Jeremy, do not pull over,
that's an order.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.952
You'll have to be sick in this -
we're on a schedule.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.515
Just stop, all right.
I'm gonna be sick, out of both ends.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.518
Jeremy, he's by my cummerbund.
Pull over immediately!

06:32.560 --> 06:34.915
VOMITS

06:37.680 --> 06:40.797
Right, so me, hat and shoes.
You, speech.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.515
Let Super Hans keep retching
till he's chundering fresh air.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.198
Meet back in 20 minutes max, OK?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.231
You're really doing this,
aren't you, you maniac?

06:48.280 --> 06:51.033
You're actually marrying Sophie
and leaving me on my own.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.149
Well, yes.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.158
I know why you're doing this, Mark.
You're marrying her to spite me.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.953
- Don't be ridiculous.
- This is you all over.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.389
You'd rather get married
for the whole of your life

07:00.440 --> 07:02.954
than consider that maybe
I might be right.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.878
Listen, Jeremy, just get yourself
to an internet cafe to cut and paste

07:05.920 --> 07:09.799
some appropriate sentiments about me
from the worldwide web, OK?

07:09.840 --> 07:12.354
'I'm not marrying out of spite,
I'm marrying out of fear.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.913
'There's a very big difference.'

07:17.400 --> 07:19.595
'Oh, this is not how I imagined it,

07:19.640 --> 07:24.236
'scrubbing my puke-stained
wedding wear in a coffee shop toilet.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.431
'Still, none of it's how I imagined it.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.233
'Just wish I felt a tiny bit excited,

07:30.280 --> 07:32.840
'not like I was marching to the gulag
for an undetermined crime.'

07:32.880 --> 07:34.154
Thank you.

07:34.200 --> 07:38.273
'God, look at her.
I would break my own fingers

07:38.320 --> 07:40.072
'just to spend one night with her.

07:40.120 --> 07:45.240
'Ah! Jenkins on Churchill,
she is the perfect woman.'

07:45.280 --> 07:46.315
Can I help you?

07:46.360 --> 07:48.590
Can I get a filter coffee to take away?

07:48.640 --> 07:49.868
Sure, anything else?

07:49.920 --> 07:52.036
'Might as well ask.'

07:52.080 --> 07:54.878
Yes, will you marry me?

07:54.920 --> 07:56.273
Sorry?

07:56.320 --> 07:58.675
You probably don't want to,
I just thought I'd check.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.792
Right, no, I don't think so.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.910
OK, that's fine, no biggie.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.390
'God, what's happening to me?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.795
'Am I really gonna get married?

08:11.840 --> 08:16.197
'I don't want to, but calling off
the wedding at the last minute?

08:16.240 --> 08:20.870
'I don't wanna hurt lovely Sophie.
Need time to think.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.639
'How can I buy some time?

08:23.680 --> 08:26.274
'Contract TB? But where from?

08:26.320 --> 08:27.912
'No badgers.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.916
'Try to get beaten up?

08:29.960 --> 08:33.395
'I could say, "He's got a fat head,"

08:33.440 --> 08:34.919
'call him a jizz cock?

08:34.960 --> 08:37.996
'Not actually an insult -
all cocks are jizz cocks really,

08:38.039 --> 08:39.837
'be like calling him a piss kidney.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.836
'Road traffic accident?

08:41.880 --> 08:44.917
'Yeah, that'd kick everything
into touch for a few months.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.394
'Shit! Could I? Here it comes.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.035
'Come on, Mark, take the hit.
Keep your eyes on the prize.'

08:52.160 --> 08:53.388
What the hell are you doing?

08:53.440 --> 08:56.716
- Sorry, I didn't see you.
- You were looking straight at me.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.399
'Must get injured! '

08:59.440 --> 09:03.035
Well, you should be more
careful, you jizz cock.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.229
What?

09:04.280 --> 09:06.874
You could have had my legs off,
you piss kidney.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.876
Arsehole.

09:08.920 --> 09:13.596
'Arsehole! Yup, nice insult -
clean, clear and insulting.'

09:13.640 --> 09:14.789
Are you OK?

09:14.840 --> 09:17.400
Yeah, yeah, fine.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.352
Bit of a wobble. I just proposed
to a woman in a coffee shop

09:20.400 --> 09:22.118
and tried to get myself run over.

09:22.160 --> 09:27.712
OK, right. That is maybe a sign
that everything isn't totally groovy.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.274
I think you're right.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.713
I shouldn't marry Sophie,
I should call it off.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.389
Brilliant! Let's call this mother off,
the old dude brothers are back.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.556
IMITATES FOG HORN

09:41.600 --> 09:44.273
One thing - you have left it
pretty late, it will be a jilting.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.514
Oh, no.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.950
God, no, no, it's not a jilting.
I'm gonna tell her right away.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.434
A jilt is at the altar, I'm not jilting.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.675
I think anything on
the wedding day is a jilting.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.632
No, at the altar.
"He jilted her at the altar."

09:56.680 --> 09:58.910
But that implies he could have
jilted her somewhere else.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.598
Come on, we need to get Super Hans
and go.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.629
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

10:01.680 --> 10:03.511
Nancy!

10:03.560 --> 10:05.357
Hello.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.789
"Hi, Jeremy. I've just had
a big bust up with my dad.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.990
"I wanna come hang out with you
at the wedding.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.474
"Can you pick me up?
I'm at the Heathrow Hilton."

10:12.520 --> 10:15.671
Brilliant, right, hold on,
I'll be right there. OK, let's go.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.950
Fuck Super Hans, he'll be fine.
Let's leave him.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.356
Do you think we can
leave him in that toilet,

10:21.400 --> 10:24.312
lying in his various liquids?

10:24.360 --> 10:28.717
Well, obviously it's not what
either of us would ideally like to do.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.239
No-one wanted to drop
the bomb on Hiroshima,

10:30.280 --> 10:32.714
but in the end it probably saved
more lives than if they hadn't.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.478
Exactly.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.559
'Pretty straightforward conflict here -
he wants to go to the wedding,

10:38.600 --> 10:42.434
'I want to see Nancy,
but I'm the one holding the wheel.'

10:42.480 --> 10:45.313
- Jez, wrong way, mate.
- Oh, it's a short cut.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.509
That's not possible.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.278
We're just making a little detour.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.595
Nancy wants to come to the wedding,
we'll just nip over to Heathrow.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.631
Nancy! No, Jez, I need to see Sophie.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.033
Just tell her on the phone.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.958
Oh, no. Cancelling the wedding
on the day is one thing,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.798
doing it over the phone, that's despicable.

10:59.840 --> 11:03.037
I don't think that a distinction
as big in reality as it is in your mind.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.150
Jeremy, we are going to see Sophie.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.269
We're going to Nancy's.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.198
Look, Jez, Nancy's bolted.
She doesn't love you.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.834
You're a love rat. One hour isn't gonna
make any fucking difference.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.633
It is, I 'm won't be known as
"Mark, the jilter" forever.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.272
We're in the middle of the road.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.959
You'll get us killed for the sake
of your legacy. Stop it!

11:19.000 --> 11:20.353
You're not fucking Blair.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.674
Release the wheel.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.711
All right. Fine, bloody hell.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.469
- Let's go and give Sophie a nice timely jilting.
- Thank you.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.757
For the record, Nancy's not bullshit.
She does love me.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.236
OK, sure, and I'm not a love rat.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.589
No, of course not.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.198
Still, good to clear the air.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.959
Yeah, I'm glad we've cleared the air.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.714
Lovely, clear air.

11:54.040 --> 11:58.636
So, here we are, the House of Pain.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.318
MOBILE BEEPS

12:00.360 --> 12:02.590
Oh, my God. Guess what?

12:02.640 --> 12:06.519
Nancy's coming after all -
Super Hans is giving her a lift!

12:06.560 --> 12:09.233
He's only bloody come through for me.

12:09.280 --> 12:13.512
Count the kisses, Mark. She's happy
and she wants to kiss me, four times.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.835
Brilliant, except of course,
I am about to cancel the wedding.

12:15.880 --> 12:19.270
Yeah, but Nancy's gonna be there,
probably in a lovely dress.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.915
Oh, God, look at it, Jez.
Look at all the wedding stuff.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.190
Everyone's getting ready for a wedding.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.231
Well, you did basically arrange a wedding.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.157
Shit, Jez, I don't think I can do it.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.749
I don't think I have a good enough
reason to call off this wedding.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.319
I know a reason.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.113
- What?
- I've got a reason,

12:38.160 --> 12:40.594
but you have to promise
not to be angry with me.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.710
What is it?
Did you get off with her?

12:42.760 --> 12:46.719
No, God, something else, but
you've got to promise not to be angry.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.513
OK, I promise. Release the gold.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.597
OK. Well, actually, I did get off with her.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.676
I snogged her at the JLB conference.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.631
What? You're kidding!

12:56.680 --> 13:00.559
You're my best friend and you
copped off with my fiancee?

13:00.600 --> 13:03.398
You lovely bastard! This is dynamite!

13:03.440 --> 13:04.919
This is the perfect excuse!

13:04.960 --> 13:07.474
Why the hell didn't you
tell me about this earlier?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.034
Well, I thought you might be angry.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.675
I am angry, very angry,
but also incredibly relieved.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.598
It's difficult to express
both emotions at once.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.392
Look, I am very sorry.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.032
You're not just saying this,

13:20.080 --> 13:22.230
you wouldn't just make this up,
would you, to try and keep me happy?

13:22.280 --> 13:24.271
- No, course not.
- Oh, this is sweet.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.880
I am out of this, no questions asked.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.799
You shitty, faithless,
backstabbing beauty.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.751
DOORBELL

13:34.720 --> 13:36.597
Hello, Mark, Jeremy.

13:36.640 --> 13:40.428
Hello, Penny. Where's Sophie?

13:40.480 --> 13:42.152
She's upstairs getting her hair done, why?

13:42.200 --> 13:44.794
- I just need to see her.
- You can't see the bride!

13:44.840 --> 13:45.909
It's bad luck.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.837
I need to see her immediately.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.075
- Why?
- Something massive has come up.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.348
Maybe I can sort it out.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.277
- You can't. Let me through.
- What do you want?

13:53.320 --> 13:58.155
Sophie was unfaithful.
She had an affair, with Jeremy.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.270
I need to talk to Sophie
about the whole wedding.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.719
You two had an affair.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.116
Well, sorry, yeah, we did a bit.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.913
- God, that's...
- I mean, not really an actual affair.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.599
We had a snog.
I mean, these things happen, Penny.

14:10.640 --> 14:15.270
- We were both very drunk.
- Mark, a snog is not an affair.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.118
Well, in my eyes,
I'm afraid she's been unfaithful.

14:18.160 --> 14:22.438
She broke a sacred bond,
sort of like a whore.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.268
You've come here to talk about
the wedding because of a drunken snog?

14:26.320 --> 14:27.435
It was a breech of trust.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.516
Oh, come on, Mark!

14:29.560 --> 14:31.391
Did you even use tongues?

14:31.440 --> 14:33.715
A bit of tongues, not much.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.990
- You see.
- Nevertheless...

14:36.040 --> 14:38.998
Nerves are perfectly natural,
but everyone's arriving.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.156
It's gonna be a wonderful day.
You'll be very happy.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.351
But if you really want to go in there
and talk to Sophie about calling it off

14:44.400 --> 14:48.188
because of a silly drunken snog,
then go on, do it.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.755
See you at the church.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.557
Why couldn't you at least
have said you'd fucked her, eh?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.636
Would that have been so very hard?

15:06.360 --> 15:08.112
How the hell has it come to this?

15:08.160 --> 15:10.628
This is wrong, this is terribly wrong.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.956
So, what do you reckon?
Are you getting married or not?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.558
I don't know,

15:15.600 --> 15:18.194
I don't wanna end up on my own,
like Miss Haversham,

15:18.240 --> 15:19.514
wanking into a flannel,

15:19.560 --> 15:24.759
but I do feel very strongly
that it's not... right.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.360
There are strong arguments on both sides.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.755
It's a moot point. This wedding is moot!

15:29.800 --> 15:33.156
It can't be moot, you can't have
a moot wedding. You need to decide.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.112
I think we should leave a note
and get the fuck out.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.798
I just don't know, Jez.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.150
Yeah, well, you need to decide
cos I'm going for a piss.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.714
'Oh, this is gonna be horrible.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.513
'He's gonna get married
and never let me forget the kiss

15:46.560 --> 15:49.279
'and Sophie will never forgive me
for telling him.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.392
'Am I actually going
to piss on the church?

15:52.440 --> 15:54.078
'It would be quite a statement.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.031
'Yeah, baby, here I go.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.752
'Richard Dawkins walks the walk,

15:57.800 --> 16:00.792
'but he does he follow through
with an actual act of piss?

16:00.840 --> 16:05.231
'Oh, shit! Sophie's dad!
Didn't even get to bloody wee.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.669
'Typical! It's all, him, him, him.'

16:07.720 --> 16:10.109
- Sophie's dad's coming!
- Shit! Hide.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.675
- What? Why?
- I need to think. I can't talk to the dad.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.234
I'm wrestling with the biggest
fucking decision of my life

16:16.280 --> 16:18.635
and he's gonna wanna talk
about button holes

16:18.680 --> 16:21.638
and the parking situation, which
to be fair, is a bit of a nightmare.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.194
What about my piss?
I really need to wee, Mark.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.390
Forget it, Jez. Hold it in.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.432
'Oh, "Hold it in," he says.
This is like a Japanese game show.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.516
'Next he'll put an octopus over my face.'

16:31.560 --> 16:33.232
OK, we're safe up here.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.996
Were you praying just then?

16:41.040 --> 16:43.156
No, of course not.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.918
I was just kneeling.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.632
Having a nice little kneel.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.475
CHURCH ORGAN PLAYS

16:53.520 --> 16:54.794
God, I am dying for a piss.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.070
It's like someone's inflating
a balloon full of urine inside me,

16:57.120 --> 16:58.838
and not in a good way.

16:59.880 --> 17:03.270
Shit! There's Mum and Dad.
Maybe I should?

17:03.320 --> 17:05.914
We'd still be OK
to go down there now, just.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.315
I could say I was looking for God up here.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.193
It might not be bad to look like
I've gone a tiny bit mad.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.117
Where's Nancy?

17:13.160 --> 17:17.233
Why still no lovely Nancy?
Oh, fuck! Sophie!

17:18.319 --> 17:23.030
(Mark) Oh, my God. There she is.
She looks so beautiful.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.673
How many missed calls have you got?

17:27.720 --> 17:29.438
28.

17:29.480 --> 17:35.794
That's bullshit. I've got 73. Right.
Shit, I need to sort this.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.479
I mean, what am I gonna do?
What's gonna happen here?

17:38.520 --> 17:40.556
Cos, personally, I have no idea.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.716
I really need to get to a urinal, Mark.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.035
Do you know what?
I think I might toss a coin.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.436
Tossing a coin might be the best
available route open to me.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.313
- You are joking?
- I don't seem to have any other ideas.

17:51.360 --> 17:56.115
OK. So, heads, I marry - lifetime of
potential grinding resentment.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.072
Tails, I stay here, become
a social outcast and turn my back

17:59.120 --> 18:00.792
on the woman I may very well love.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.479
- I'm excited.
- I'm kind of excited too.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.999
So...

18:07.000 --> 18:09.958
Ah, it's marry. I'm gonna marry. Shit.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.433
Best of three?

18:11.480 --> 18:13.789
Yes, exactly, best of three.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.910
Ah, heads again. Shit!

18:15.960 --> 18:17.075
Best of five?

18:17.120 --> 18:18.712
No, the coin has spoken.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.035
Great. Let's get out of here. I am busting.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.034
- No, I'm not getting married.
- You're over-ruling the coin?

18:25.080 --> 18:28.152
Well, the coin isn't the boss of me,
Jeremy. And how I felt

18:28.200 --> 18:30.395
when it told me to marry makes me think
I definitely shouldn't.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.830
So, text everyone...
text everyone to tell them that.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.915
A text?

18:34.960 --> 18:39.112
Tell them... Tell them I'm doing
a Stephen Fry. We're in Brussels.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.720
I'm eating chips and mayonnaise.
I'm on the edge.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.591
You found a blanket
under the garage door

18:43.640 --> 18:46.791
and I'm wearing an overcoat
and no-one should approach me

18:46.840 --> 18:49.195
and I'll be back soon
and everything's fine.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.471
Maybe we'll have a wedding in a couple of
weeks, but I'm on the edge, stress that.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.988
Everyone needs to be kind to me.
Text that.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.110
You want me to send all that
to everyone?

18:57.160 --> 18:58.479
I'll cover the cost.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.036
OK, fine, man, but first I can't go on
any longer, my bladder, I'm busting.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.548
I'm sorry, there's nothing
I can do, is there?

19:05.600 --> 19:06.794
Let me piss in that prayer bucket.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.832
Prayer bucket?
There's no such thing as...

19:09.880 --> 19:11.154
That's just a bucket.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.156
OK, I'm gonna creep up to the bucket.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.189
No, no, no, you can't move.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.913
What am I gonna do then?
I can't hold on?

19:16.960 --> 19:20.714
If you really can't hold it in, then
you'll just have to... piss yourself.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.910
You're telling me to piss myself?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.473
Yes, piss yourself.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.239
- Is this what it's come to?
- Yes, and do it quietly.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.272
Great, and what shall I do
after I've pissed myself?

19:30.320 --> 19:34.711
Fuck myself? Eat myself?
You're such a...

19:34.760 --> 19:36.751
- Are you doing it already?
- Yes, I'm doing it already.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.873
I'm so pathetic that as soon as you ordered
me to piss myself, I started the procedure.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.114
This is what you've done.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.993
You've ground down my sense
of self-worth over the years.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.314
When are you gonna stop?

19:46.360 --> 19:47.918
Not for a bit.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.349
Stop, Jeremy!
It's going down the cracks.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.118
- I can't stop.
- Stop.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.392
Oh, "Piss yourself. Stop pissing yourself."
The floodgates are open.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.953
I'm ordering you to stop!

19:58.000 --> 20:00.514
You're being a real dick
about this, aren't you?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.039
Shit! >

20:07.520 --> 20:10.910
Oh, shit, shit! Oh, my god!
This has gotta be a dream.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.996
Nothing this bad
could ever happen in reality.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.470
'What am I gonna do?
Throw myself off? '

20:17.520 --> 20:20.990
Surprise! Hello. It's me.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.237
Look, I've surprised you.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.430
What a brilliant joke!

20:30.240 --> 20:35.951
<i>...And so, in a sense,
Sophie and Mark, here before us,</i>

20:36.000 --> 20:39.913
are not just marrying each other,
but marrying all of us today.

20:39.960 --> 20:44.033
- Are you sure you want to do this, Mark?
- Of course I want to do this. This is great.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.275
It's just with the hiding.

20:46.320 --> 20:51.235
I wasn't hiding, Sophie. It was a stag thing
and it really, really worked.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.909
Everyone was so surprised,
especially you. Brilliant.

20:54.960 --> 20:59.670
But first I am required to ask anyone
present who knows a reason

20:59.720 --> 21:05.033
why these persons may not lawfully
marry to declare it now.

21:05.080 --> 21:08.550
'Oh, please! Someone, save me!

21:08.600 --> 21:11.194
'Jeremy? Spacemen? '

21:11.240 --> 21:15.199
The vows you are about to take
are to be made in the name of God,

21:15.240 --> 21:18.676
who is judge of all and knows
all the secrets of our hearts.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.917
'He's ladling it on now.
Is that the proper thing?

21:21.960 --> 21:24.315
'He hasn't just put that in
to needle me, has he? '

21:24.360 --> 21:26.271
SHE SOBS

21:26.320 --> 21:30.598
'Oh, great, now she's crying and I probably
look like a wife beater. I'm unhappy too.'

21:30.640 --> 21:33.916
Will you take
Sophie Hortensia Chapman...

21:33.960 --> 21:35.632
'Hortensia!

21:35.680 --> 21:37.716
'Oh, this is a fucking disaster.

21:37.760 --> 21:42.276
'Look at me. I'm one of those men
women read about in their magazines.'

21:42.320 --> 21:45.710
<i>...and forsaking all others
be faithful to her</i>

21:45.760 --> 21:47.796
as long as you both shall live.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.229
l-I will.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.238
'That's it. I've ruined it.
I've ruined my life.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.750
'You only get one life
and I've ruined mine.'

21:56.800 --> 21:58.028
<i>...as long as you both shall live?</i>

21:58.080 --> 21:59.877
'Please don't say; "I will."'

21:59.920 --> 22:02.150
- I will.
- 'Oh.'

22:02.200 --> 22:05.192
Then I now pronounce you,
man and wife.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.356
BOTH SOB

22:07.400 --> 22:09.960
You may kiss the bride.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.958
'Tears of joy. They're tears of joy.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.355
'That's the line we both stick to,

22:15.400 --> 22:19.996
'now and for the rest
of our miserable lives.'

22:20.040 --> 22:23.828
'So, I've done it. I'm married.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.519
'lf only New Labour hadn't abolished
the tax advantages,

22:26.560 --> 22:29.120
'I'd have something positive
to cling on to right now.'

22:29.160 --> 22:30.149
Ow!

22:30.200 --> 22:33.397
Look, you could really... Some of
it's going on Sophie, guys, please!

22:33.440 --> 22:37.513
Come on! He got married, didn't he?
Leave him alone.

22:37.560 --> 22:42.190
Thanks. Thanks, Jez.
I'll see you at the reception.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.355
OK.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.514
It'll be all right, mate.
You can still come round.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.711
I'll keep your room just the same -
like if you'd died.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.354
IMITATES FOGHORN

22:53.400 --> 22:57.678
IMITATES FOGHORN

22:57.720 --> 22:59.790
'OK, it's happened, he's gone.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.558
'I'm on my own.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.114
'This is a disaster.
I need to take stock.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.072
'I need to reassess. I need to find someone
who can sell me some weed.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.317
'Where's Nancy?
Her lovely face always makes...

23:10.360 --> 23:12.351
'Oh, fuck! '

23:15.200 --> 23:20.035
Well, that was... that was one
to tell our grandchildren about.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.069
SOBBING

23:21.120 --> 23:23.190
'Oh, God, more crying.'

23:23.240 --> 23:24.958
Come on, Soph.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.788
You're worried about the caterers, aren't you?
Not everyone will go for the tuna.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.549
I just feel terrible. I feel like
I've been shot in the stomach.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.591
Don't say that, Sophs.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.949
It's done now. Were over the hump.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.151
The hump! Our wedding - the hump!

23:40.200 --> 23:41.792
Stop the car!

23:41.840 --> 23:44.354
I just wanna go and scrub it all out.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.949
It's not that easy, Soph. That was
the Church of England marriage service,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.195
not applying for a Nectar card.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.071
Whatever! Divorce, annulled.

23:52.120 --> 23:55.078
I can't... This isn't what I want.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.039
He's horrible.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.594
SOBBING

24:03.880 --> 24:06.269
'That's it. I'm alone.

24:06.320 --> 24:11.474
'Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up
in my bed alone, unless I hire

24:11.520 --> 24:14.080
'a prostitute... just for the night?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.236
'Kind of like a wedding present.'

24:16.280 --> 24:18.919
Are you OK, man?

24:18.960 --> 24:21.713
Me? Yeah, good.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.228
No, feeling pretty good.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.840
Do you want some company?

24:26.880 --> 24:29.348
That'd be nice.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.232
You know, you do smell
really quite strongly of piss.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.794
And your hat and shoes smell of puke.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.070
So I guess neither of us
are exactly the king, are we?

24:42.720 --> 24:45.439
So, what now? Back to the flat?

24:45.480 --> 24:47.391
Drive on!

24:47.440 --> 24:50.876
So, Nancy, did she not show up?

24:50.920 --> 24:52.956
No, she did...

24:53.000 --> 24:55.309
with Super Hans. So, that's nice.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.716
I think I might divorce her,
see how she likes that.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.992
Well, I suppose I should apologise
for not letting you go and get her.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.918
Yeah, I was pretty pissed off about that,

25:05.960 --> 25:09.236
but I was thinking of waiting for a bit
before I brought it up.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.511
Oh, that's nice. Thanks, man.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.712
It's fine. I'll just chuck it in with
all my other mouldering resentments.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.354
Exactly. Stick it on the bill.
