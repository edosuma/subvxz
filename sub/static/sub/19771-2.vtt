Fifty years have passed,

(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

00:20.980 --> 00:24.275
Yet the suffering continues.

00:26.236 --> 00:31.491
Aku's grasp chokes the past,
present, and future.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.245
Hope is lost.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.456
Gotta get back,

00:38.540 --> 00:40.208

have come to offer tribute!

01:38.516 --> 01:44.439
Oh, great Shogun of Sorrow,
Master of All Masters,

01:44.772 --> 01:47.942
you have allowed us
to inhabit this world,

01:48.026 --> 01:50.945
and for that,
we are forever grateful.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.322
(GROANS)

01:52.405 --> 01:54.991
We offer you a special tribute.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.367
Stop!

01:56.451 --> 01:58.995
(STAMMERS)
Look at what you're doing!

01:59.329 --> 02:02.707
You're getting yourselves
all over the floor.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.916
Uh...

02:04.125 --> 02:06.544
I just had it vacuumed.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.713
Out. Out!

02:08.796 --> 02:10.256
Get out!

02:10.965 --> 02:15.595
Master. (CHUCKLES)
Master, we've done it.

02:16.012 --> 02:17.930
May I introduce

02:18.014 --> 02:22.060
the most epic version
of the beetle drone yet!

02:22.143 --> 02:24.771
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

02:24.854 --> 02:26.773
And I care because?

02:27.690 --> 02:30.902
B-B-Because the Samurai.
You've wanted to kill him since forever.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.112
He's the bane of your existence.

02:33.363 --> 02:34.697
Oh!

02:34.781 --> 02:37.742
That was the old Aku.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.745
This is the new Aku.

02:40.953 --> 02:45.583
And he really doesn't care
about a pathetic samurai

02:45.667 --> 02:48.586
who wanders around like a mad fool.

02:48.711 --> 02:49.879
Ha!

02:49.962 --> 02:52.298
It's hilarious, really.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.385
Look, I tell you what...

02:55.635 --> 02:59.347
you want to destroy him, go ahead.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.057
Who cares?

03:01.641 --> 03:07.647
I certainly don't, not one bit at all.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.692
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

03:13.403 --> 03:16.698
So, tell me what's been bothering you.

03:17.073 --> 03:22.245
Well, you see, Doc,
it's been over 50 years already.

03:22.662 --> 03:24.372
It's been that long?

03:24.664 --> 03:25.707
Yes.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.584
You see, that's the actual problem.

03:28.835 --> 03:34.006
Once I eradicated all the time portals,

03:34.340 --> 03:38.010
I thought I would just wait it out
and then the Samur--

03:38.094 --> 03:40.054
We don't say his name here.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.807
It is a safe place.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.810
Yes. Sorry, Doctor.

03:46.102 --> 03:51.524
Well, I-I just assumed that eventually
over time he would just

03:51.607 --> 03:55.862
- Die!
- Die!

03:57.029 --> 03:59.657
But he hasn't even aged.

04:00.158 --> 04:01.868
I mean, like, at all.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.787
He just grew that stupid beard.

04:04.871 --> 04:08.124
It looks like he'll be here forever!

04:08.374 --> 04:12.754
I-I just don't know if I can handle that.

04:14.380 --> 04:18.217
Yes. It seems that the initial time travel

04:18.301 --> 04:22.096
has affected the aging process.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.974
It's quite the conundrum.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.517
Yes.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.061
What is that again?

04:29.812 --> 04:33.816
Just a confusing or difficult problem.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.319
Yes. Problem.

04:37.153 --> 04:41.532
I wish there was someone who
can dispose of my problem.

04:42.074 --> 04:45.870
BOTH: Yes. One can hope.

when Aku finds you

10:07.024 --> 10:08.651
and realizes you have no sword?

10:09.068 --> 10:12.613
Aku doesn't know, and he hasn't
shown himself in years.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.991

can defeat me.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.868

the only honorable thing to do is...

- Quiet.
- No!

in this forsaken time!
