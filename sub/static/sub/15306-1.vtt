02:19.840 --> 02:23.322
Wake up, Mr Ryan.
You're late for your appointment.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.527
That's exactly right, 5,000 shares.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.404
Now, don't do this to me again, Henry.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.140
That's right...

02:39.240 --> 02:41.811
All right, I'll talk to you later.

02:44.720 --> 02:50.250
You're a hard man to find, Mr Ryan.
We were almost certain you'd retired.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.567
I hate mornings, that's all.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.900
Well, do come in. I'd like
to show you the trivial part first.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.500
To the people of Cypra,
he's known as "The Brother".

03:02.600 --> 03:08.580
A stubborn, extremely intelligent man.
Ranges from liberal to hard-core leftist.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.940
The junta put him away 15 years ago.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.140
They can't kill him
and they can't let him out.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.660
Either way leads to revolution.

03:15.760 --> 03:20.700
This is Michael Bartos,
the chief of Intelligence and Security.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.820
On the one hand,
he's a patron of the arts.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.140
On the other, he's the high priest
of the local death squads.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.780
In a land filled with poverty,
he lives like a king.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.860
Naturally, he enjoys the status quo.
We want it changed.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.726
We? Am I talking to one man or a company?

03:38.640 --> 03:42.300
If you're talking about
the CIA, the answer is no.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.448
This is far beyond their scope.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.540
We've let them run errands for us
every once in a while,

03:47.640 --> 03:50.340
but I find them clumsy and anachronistic.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.860
Besides, our group
has no political motives.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.620
In that country,
taking a dump's political.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.660
You're probably right.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.764
Let me conclude the trivial part first.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.324
The country we're talking about
is tiny and insignificant.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.820
I've heard people in the Senate
call it a "shithouse",

04:11.920 --> 04:13.900
justifiably so.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.260
A number of countries, ours included,

04:16.360 --> 04:20.540
have washed their rear ends
there on occasion.

04:20.640 --> 04:25.220
The irony is...
we put the government there.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.700
So what happened? Bad investment?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.167
Greed is what happened.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.260
The colonels sucked up all of the cash

04:33.360 --> 04:35.900
and bankrupt the country
within three years.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.220
Now, they want to sell out
and go to bed with the competition.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.900
So! I guess this is the part where
you tell me what you want from me.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.340
You did a couple of promising jobs
in Salvador.

04:46.440 --> 04:50.740
There are those who don't like
the "Brat Pack" type of mercenary.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.300
They say they're unreliable.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.220
But I'm very much in favor of new blood.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.020
You don't have any track record
and that's perfect for covert actions.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.940
The country's ready to blow.
All we need is a match to light the fire.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.660
You think an old man
can lead a revolution?

05:07.760 --> 05:10.900
- Properly handled, yes.
- And what if I'm not interested?

05:12.560 --> 05:15.660
Would 350,000 dollars pique your interest?

05:15.760 --> 05:18.140
It's not a shabby advance.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.860
I'm glad you understand finances.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.780
There's another 350,000
when you finish the job.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.660
As I said,
the briefing was the trivial part.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.820
This is the heart of the matter.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.500
Yeah. Ten out of ten times.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.740
You'll also have to pay
for a few good men.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.100
You won't need any men.
You and your professionals

05:37.200 --> 05:39.500
wouldn't stand a chance
of getting inside of a country

05:39.600 --> 05:41.660
with security as tough as theirs.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.740
You'd be dead before
you signed the hotel register.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.580
What you need are a few good women.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.820
I don't get the joke.

05:51.920 --> 05:56.980
The computer checked out
2,442 possible alternatives.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.562
The only one that has a chance
of working is this.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.180
You are Cecil Thornton, a brilliant
and successful fashion designer.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.180
Now, the Bartos regime
is hungry for publicity.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.700
You take six of your top models
and your new collection

06:13.800 --> 06:15.780
and you premiere it all in Cypra.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.140
You charm the pants off the colonels.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.980
You connect with our inside contact...
you get our man.

06:22.080 --> 06:28.180
We have spent a fortune, establishing
this fictitious designer, Cecil Thornton.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.540
Now that his name is in great demand,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.620
it's time for us to harvest
the fruits of our labor.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.340
You want me to be some faggot designer?

06:36.440 --> 06:39.523
Faggot... yes, that's very good.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.340
I believe you know Miss Rogers.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.100
Hi Frank.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.940
And this is Miss Wells.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.740
Her father was the cultural attachÃ© there

06:52.840 --> 06:57.500
before the colonels decided
that he was a spy and told him to go.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.400
She knows the country. She's well trained.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.340
Thomas, this is stupid. I'm out of here.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.445
Listen asshole, I'm sick and tired
of your macho crap.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.820
You were hired to do a job.
You got the money, you made a deal.

07:13.920 --> 07:19.180
We've done all your homework for you
and this is the only way.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.409
So just get in the driver's
seat and drive.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.940
Personally, I think it's the perfect plan.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.620
Nothing is perfect
when women are involved.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.500
That's probably the worst
chauvinistic drivel I've ever heard.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.180
From Eve to Margaret Thatcher,
you've managed to screw up history.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.700
Swell.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.780
I think we better clear the air right now.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.540
Nothing to clear. You made your point
when you chickened out in Salvador.

08:19.640 --> 08:24.980
Goddammit, Frank. It wasn't like that
at all. I got trapped. I lost three men.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.180
And I did come back. But not in time.

08:28.280 --> 08:31.260
It's too bad nobody's alive
to vouch for that story.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.940
Hey, I looked for you for three years.
Nobody knew if you were dead or alive.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.980
I was dead, Sheila.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.900
I took this job
only because you were involved.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.402
This time you're getting paid.
You mess up...

08:44.520 --> 08:48.180
I'll cancel your check or break your neck.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.645
Or both.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.020
I smell Beverly Hills.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.220
You're not a powder puff, are you, kid?

09:32.760 --> 09:35.060
- Dammit!
- She's quick...

09:35.160 --> 09:37.891
She's smart... She'll be all right.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.620
Giousel, Sivi... Giousel.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.220
One of these days, you'll oil
your body and wrestle with me.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.940
You're not even in my league, shitface.

10:30.040 --> 10:33.980
You're lucky you have visitors around
but they can't stay forever.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.340
When they leave you come to my room

10:36.440 --> 10:39.500
and I'll put out my cigarette
on your nipples.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.740
So, let me get this straight.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.780
I agree to do this job
and I'm out of here?

10:45.880 --> 10:47.820
You're out of here if I say so.

10:47.920 --> 10:51.980
- Hey lover, I wasn't talking to you.
- He's the boss, Sivi.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.860
I'm in this shitpile for smuggling
20 kilos of pure heroin.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.940
This ain't no Hilton, friend.
It's a Turkish slammer.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.180
Now just how the hell can you
bebop in here and spring me?

11:04.280 --> 11:08.100
None of your business.
Now, you're in or not?

11:08.200 --> 11:11.260
- What's the catch?
- Catch is, your ass is mine.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.900
Make a wrong move, you're dead.
If the bad guys don't get you, I will.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.740
- And after?
- If you stay alive...

11:19.840 --> 11:22.060
you get a brand new name
and a clean record.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.049
OK, I'm in.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.571
- Guess what?
- What?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.289
I'm a civilian.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.780
'Pardon? Christ, that's funny.'

11:47.880 --> 11:49.700
'Let me ask you a question.'

11:49.800 --> 11:52.860
What do you think your chances are
of getting out of here on your own?

11:52.960 --> 11:56.407
I've been convicted of murder,
conspiracy and treason.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.620
Including defection to the Ruskies.
Now, how's that for a resume?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.620
- How much of it's true?
- Delete the defection, all of it.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.451
The CIA is willing to lose your file.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.404
'They gonna forget
that I used to work for them?

12:09.520 --> 12:12.660
'That I did their dirty work?
I did 13 contracts in two years

12:12.760 --> 12:16.140
'and they set me up for this because
I refused to do old man Sinopoli?

12:16.240 --> 12:19.050
'They gonna lose all that too?'

12:20.560 --> 12:23.140
'Water under the bridge.'

12:30.080 --> 12:33.540
I worked with Katrina years ago in Warsaw.

12:33.640 --> 12:37.900
After they brought her to this dump
I came to see her twice.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.220
She's still catatonic.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.980
Refuses to speak.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.980
How good is she?

12:44.080 --> 12:46.321
Nobody's better with a blade.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.260
Last year, three Soviet soldiers
beat her parents to death.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.443
Then they raped her, shot her,
and left her for dead.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.369
But she survived.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.567
Except that the trauma left her mute.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.540
So she hunted down the killers
and nailed them

13:04.640 --> 13:07.291
with a tranquilizer gun
and a straight edge.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.610
The Solidarity shipped her
out of Poland to Italy.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.660
Get out.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.161
It's me, Sheila. Sheila Rogers, remember?

13:44.640 --> 13:46.290
They've got her loaded.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.500
Come on.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.446
We're taking you out of here.
You're gonna get a chance to get even.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.402
Beautiful.

14:24.320 --> 14:28.740
Thanks for everything.
Good to see you. Take care.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.968
See you later.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.140
Who's there?

14:45.240 --> 14:47.129
Someone who knows.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.660
I don't like jokes.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.969
Hey, you think the Palestinians
have a sense of humor?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.620
Don't worry, Dahlia, I'm not with the PLO.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.441
and as far as I'm concerned,
you're not an Israeli anymore.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.540
What was that name? Yeah, Jericho.

15:06.640 --> 15:10.860
23 PLO head honchos in five short months?

15:10.960 --> 15:14.260
Then the world stops
hearing about Jericho.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.980
I could be wrong but I believe
it was Rio, September, '87.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.620
Your face, dialogue coach,
and a clean American accent...

15:23.720 --> 15:26.860
- ...and a new identity.
- How much do you want?

15:26.960 --> 15:30.740
I'm a pushover. I'll settle for your life.

15:30.840 --> 15:34.500
- We need you for a job, that's all.
- I'm through with all that.

15:34.600 --> 15:39.140
I'm afraid you're not. Either you go on
a little Mediterranean cruise with us,

15:39.240 --> 15:42.403
dance a little, kill a little,
have a barrel of fun.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.740
Or every camel jockey from here to Mecca

15:44.840 --> 15:47.844
is going to be blowing smoke
up your pretty ass.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.169
Hey Sivi.

16:01.400 --> 16:06.940
Murder, blood and paranoia are gonna
make fine company where you're going.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.566
'Cause ladies, you're going to hell.

16:10.520 --> 16:14.127
My job, and I hate it,
is to train you as a team.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.780
You got to look good,
move well and kill quick.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.980
You're a bunch of amateurs
with a few special skills.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.402
And I hope to God, that when the time
comes and I need those skills,

16:24.520 --> 16:27.444
you don't let me down. If you do...

16:27.560 --> 16:29.860
you won't be coming back.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.220
I'm your life insurance.

16:32.320 --> 16:37.780
I'm also holding your money,
because, ladies, this job is COD.

16:37.880 --> 16:41.080
And one more thing...
I don't like working with women.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.731
Sheila, put the kids to bed.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.180
Good speech, Frank.

16:56.280 --> 17:01.002
Cut the crap, Sheila. You don't con me.
I've been watching you.

17:02.320 --> 17:06.660
You've lost your edge. Find it, fast.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.099
Keep that pretty head down, babe.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.099
- Drop dead.
- Come on, move it. Come on.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.441
Keep those heads down.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.580
You got a nice ass, Miss Rogers.
I'd hate to see you lose it.

17:31.680 --> 17:37.244
Don't get crazy. He's the only man
around here for a hundred miles.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.740
Stop dragging your ass, Sheila.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.922
- Son of a bitch!
- I love you, too.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.410
Hey Sivi, you really look different.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.060
Get lost.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.083
But you still sound the same. Forget it.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.011
Shit!

21:41.160 --> 21:43.020
Got a smoke?

21:43.120 --> 21:44.690
Sure.

21:45.760 --> 21:50.448
You're a good soldier.
You could be a good leader too.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.369
It's your motivation that sucks.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.608
Look, I'm not geared for girl talk, Dahlia.
Make your point.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.260
All right. The point is this...

22:00.360 --> 22:04.684
All the rest of them have a reason
for being here. They had a choice.

22:05.680 --> 22:10.129
Me, you blackmailed.
You fucked up my life.

22:11.080 --> 22:17.440
So, if I were you,
I'd keep an eye on Dahlia.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.805
Kind of you to warn me.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.842
One soldier to another...

22:47.760 --> 22:50.445
All right, pal. I'm coming to get you.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.940
- Yeah?
- Good morning, are we ready?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.900
I don't know about you. We are.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.260
Good. Everything is set,

23:15.360 --> 23:17.860
'and we're booked
for your big show in Cypra.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.980
'The computer files are all erased,'

23:20.080 --> 23:22.900
your girls all have brand new IDs,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.860
and you are officially, Cecil Thornton.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.780
It'd better be that way.
Because if you screw up,

23:29.880 --> 23:33.300
no matter what kind of bind
you get me into, I'll get out.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.500
And fancy security guards or not,
I'll pay you a little visit.

23:36.600 --> 23:40.446
Not to worry, Mr Ryan. With any luck,
you'll be back for my birthday.

23:40.560 --> 23:44.580
We'll celebrate your success
and you'll collect the rest of your money.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.620
'So, just be good.
And Mr Ryan... do be careful.'

23:47.720 --> 23:49.540
If Bartos should find out,

23:49.640 --> 23:52.620
if something should go wrong,
you've never heard of me

23:52.720 --> 23:54.740
because I've never heard of you.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.580
Sounds like standard MO for you guys.

23:57.680 --> 24:02.402
Get the job done and we don't
give a damn whether you live or die.

24:02.520 --> 24:07.540
- You sure you're not a politician?
- I'm much worse...

24:07.640 --> 24:09.244
I'm a businessman.

24:26.640 --> 24:30.020
In other news today, Minister
of Interior Affairs, Michael Bartos

24:30.120 --> 24:33.300
responded to allegations
of the European Community Council

24:33.400 --> 24:35.860
that Cypra
is in violation of human rights.

24:35.960 --> 24:40.700
Mr Bartos labelled the accusations
as ridiculous and stated,

24:40.800 --> 24:43.780
"Our enemies are short-sighted.
There are no death squads in Cypra."

25:15.200 --> 25:17.601
Let's get going. Get in the car.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.010
Nico! Nico!

25:39.960 --> 25:43.442
Oh no. Darlings, too fast.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.847
Too harsh, slow down.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.660
Go with it flow with it, roll with it.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.240
Don't be stiff.

25:55.400 --> 25:59.820
Now, look at the audience
as if every man was your lover

25:59.920 --> 26:02.844
and take a slight bow.

26:07.520 --> 26:12.100
Magnificent! Absolutely magnificent.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.524
Take ten, ladies.

26:24.720 --> 26:29.260
I specifically stated, there was to be
no press, no visitors whatsoever!

26:29.360 --> 26:31.700
How in God's name did you get in here?

26:31.800 --> 26:36.681
Mr Thornton, my name is Michael Bartos.

26:37.760 --> 26:42.500
Mr Bartos,
I'm so sorry I was harsh with you.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.409
No, not at all,

26:44.520 --> 26:47.410
I should've given you some advance notice.

26:47.520 --> 26:52.401
But I was so very keen
to welcome you to Cypra in person.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.780
The pleasure's all mine, I assure you.

26:55.880 --> 27:00.620
Ladies, meet our host, Michael Bartos.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.780
Thank you for the honor.

27:06.880 --> 27:12.603
Perhaps I shall have the opportunity
of returning your amazing grace.

27:13.720 --> 27:17.820
I should be happy if you will
have dinner with me tonight maybe

27:17.920 --> 27:19.820
at ten o'clock.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.207
We'd love to, Mr Bartos.

27:25.280 --> 27:28.780
If 10:00 is too late,
perhaps you will tell me.

27:28.880 --> 27:33.660
But in my country, people take
a siesta from 2:00 until 5:00

27:33.760 --> 27:36.020
and then they work until 9:00.

27:36.120 --> 27:41.340
You see, the basic difference
between us here and you Americans,

27:41.440 --> 27:46.207
is that you live to work. We work to live.

28:10.360 --> 28:15.780
And now, to my very beautiful guests,

28:15.880 --> 28:18.167
I should like to propose a toast...

28:23.680 --> 28:29.900
You see, Mr Thornton,
Cypra is already wearing your fashions.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.100
And to think there are people who still
think we are a backward country.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.620
You can never be
totally popular or totally right.

28:37.720 --> 28:42.700
Totally popular or totally right.
I like that, who said this?

28:42.800 --> 28:44.900
Cecil Thornton.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.820
It's his motto.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.660
I like it. Then I shall use it often

28:49.760 --> 28:52.445
but please do not accuse me of plagiarism.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.780
Imitation is the sincerest form
of flattery, Mr Bartos.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.650
Of course, I can ask him.
But ask him yourself?

29:05.800 --> 29:11.580
Mr Thornton, Ana wants to know
whether or not you find her attractive?

29:11.680 --> 29:16.060
If I said yes, it would be
a gross understatement.

29:16.160 --> 29:21.340
Then, I have an idea but please,
do not misunderstand me.

29:21.440 --> 29:25.780
I am not an artistic man
but even when I was in the military,

29:25.880 --> 29:28.980
my career bordered
on the artistic, you see?

29:29.080 --> 29:32.220
Mr Thornton, what would you say

29:32.320 --> 29:37.620
if you had seven beauties instead of six?

29:37.720 --> 29:39.449
You see, my Ana

29:39.560 --> 29:44.540
is one of the most popular
fashion models in this country.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.620
It would be wonderful for her career.

29:46.720 --> 29:51.820
Well, I'm not quite sure
that would work, Mr Bartos.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.900
These ladies have had a lot of training.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.900
What she lacks in training,
she makes up for

29:58.000 --> 30:00.401
with a plethora of talent, I assure you.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.800
- I'm sorry.
- Idiot!

30:03.960 --> 30:06.500
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.524
Ana, sit down.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.580
We have guests.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.648
I'm sorry.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.570
There are seven continents.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.803
The conquerors searched
for the seven cities of Cibola.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.660
There are seven wonders of the world.

30:30.760 --> 30:37.564
And here, a toast
to the new magnificent seven.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.288
So, we just let
the little bitch spy on us?

30:59.440 --> 31:03.620
We can use her. If Bartos
is sniffing for information

31:03.720 --> 31:06.700
we can pipe what we want him
to know through her.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.940
Scum like Bartos are never content
with just one snitch.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.580
He's probably bugging our rooms too.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.445
Yeah, and anything else
he can get his hands on.

31:15.560 --> 31:19.300
So nobody talks unless we're in the open.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.940
We'll meet our contact soon enough.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.020
Code name's May, as in the month.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.740
He's a local, works with the underground.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.860
Till then, just swing your hips.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.180
So the ever elusive Cecil Thornton

31:32.280 --> 31:34.540
who would not be interviewed on camera,

31:34.640 --> 31:36.449
gave Cypra its biggest season.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.580
So, how you doing, love? Wanna chat?

31:38.680 --> 31:42.620
- Knock it off, Sivi.
- I mean well, OK? I like her.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.300
One wrong move,
you'll have Frank on our ass.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.644
That might be interesting.
Perverse but interesting.

32:07.040 --> 32:10.726
Hey Sheila, you've got
a good little body there

32:12.160 --> 32:14.561
considering your age.

32:15.920 --> 32:19.020
Ryan doesn't seem to notice
though, does he?

32:19.120 --> 32:21.540
Look, you got the hots for Ryan,
honey, you can have him.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.340
Not without references, hon.

32:24.440 --> 32:27.820
But tell me,
how would you rate Ryan in the sack?

32:27.920 --> 32:31.180
You know what I think?
I think you're a frigid bitch

32:31.280 --> 32:33.660
who's probably never had
an orgasm in her life.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.940
You wouldn't know an orgasm
if it landed in your face.

32:37.040 --> 32:41.140
Ladies, you're behaving
like trashy tarts in a hair salon.

32:41.240 --> 32:45.300
How about you, Daph?
How would you rate Ryan?

32:45.400 --> 32:48.620
- I'm afraid I don't know him that well.
- Come on, kid, fess up,

32:48.720 --> 32:51.820
you must've had at least
one quickie with him, right?

32:51.920 --> 32:53.900
Why else would he have brought you along

32:54.000 --> 32:56.924
if you weren't really good at quickies?

32:58.920 --> 33:01.980
- Really fucking funny.
- Come on. Let's play some more.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.220
You're not worth the trouble.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.446
All right, no more!

33:33.560 --> 33:35.528
Stop it!

33:39.240 --> 33:41.242
I said, stop it!

33:50.400 --> 33:52.940
- Time's up, kid.
- I'll kill her!

33:53.040 --> 33:54.849
Grow up!

34:11.199 --> 34:13.900
And now to present my latest in swimwear,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.128
"Splash with Metallics".

35:59.040 --> 36:00.520
Bravo!

36:01.220 --> 36:02.868
Bravo!

36:07.080 --> 36:12.325
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you, Mr Cecil Thornton.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.171
Ladies... let's mingle.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.086
- You having fun yet?
- Some fun now.

37:08.080 --> 37:12.540
I don't trust Thomas' plan.
I don't think his contact is gonna show.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.847
Keep smiling...

37:19.160 --> 37:21.049
Just doing my job.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.140
What do you think happened?

37:24.240 --> 37:27.060
Maybe the death squads got him.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.980
What if he talked?

37:29.080 --> 37:32.500
- If he talked, we'd all be dead right now.
- What's the plan then?

37:32.600 --> 37:37.970
I'm gonna do some walking.
You keep an eye on Bartos.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.843
Be careful.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.201
- Is he armed?
- No.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.540
Can we help you, Mr Thornton?

40:15.640 --> 40:17.620
This isn't the bathroom is it?

40:17.720 --> 40:22.740
It is Mr Bartos' private study.
Usually guarded,

40:22.840 --> 40:24.500
and very dangerous for intruders.

40:24.600 --> 40:28.060
So what are you gonna do, shoot me?

40:28.160 --> 40:31.620
You underestimate Bartos, Mr Ryan.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.180
He may be a megalomaniac
but he's not a fool.

40:35.280 --> 40:38.940
He would never keep vital secrets
in such an obvious place.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.900
- I was the first to look.
- You're Thomas' contact?

40:43.000 --> 40:46.740
I was told you were
a professional, Mr Ryan.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.820
What are you doing,
risking your cover like this?

40:48.920 --> 40:53.300
You're late. I can't sit around
this country forever.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.500
What are you doing risking yours?

40:55.600 --> 41:00.367
I had to be sure before I made my move.
Bartos is always watching.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.220
And don't worry about my cover.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.300
It's true what they say
about love being blind.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.529
The smartest and most powerful
are the most vulnerable.

41:12.040 --> 41:16.090
- This is Louis, he's with us.
- So, what's next?

42:21.240 --> 42:23.820
Time to tell the future, Tara.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.980
Our brother is the future.

42:26.080 --> 42:30.324
The future is the revolution.
Welcome, Ana.

42:32.040 --> 42:35.522
Ladies, meet our inside man.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.620
All right, what's the story?

42:47.720 --> 42:50.451
Bartos is moving the Brother tomorrow.

42:50.560 --> 42:53.140
So far he's kept him in prisons
where no one would know.

42:53.240 --> 42:57.980
But fearing revolution and with recent
unrest in the army, he was moved

42:58.080 --> 43:00.820
- to a high security prison.
- How sure are you?

43:00.920 --> 43:03.900
Ana intercepted a call
to Bartos last Sunday.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.700
It is the only thing we have.
They need to keep the move quiet.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.900
So, they won't use a lot of men.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.740
We guess 30 or 40...

43:13.840 --> 43:17.100
They will travel at night
and rest during the day.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.180
They will have to spend one night here
in this old fortress

43:20.280 --> 43:23.980
an abandoned military installation.
This is where they will be easy to get.

43:24.080 --> 43:27.180
Easy? Inside a fortress with 30 or 40 men?

43:27.280 --> 43:30.580
That's what I call a piece of cake.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.620
Louis served in a special unit
that was housed here.

43:33.720 --> 43:35.300
He knows all the ins and outs,

43:35.400 --> 43:38.340
secret passages, places where
they might keep the Brother.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.780
- Plan sounds flimsy.
- That's all we've got.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.940
If your country is
so hell bent on revolution,

43:43.040 --> 43:44.860
why can't you do this yourselves?

43:44.960 --> 43:47.060
Without a leader, the people are useless.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.401
I thought leaders were
a dime a dozen here.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.300
Don't worry, Mr Ryan.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.340
- You won't be mistaken for an idealist.
- Good.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.820
You need to do some shopping.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.180
A couple of slingshots
and few more serious pieces.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.580
There are some guerrilla fighters
in the mountains.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.780
- They'll give us their weapons.
- How do we get there?

44:09.880 --> 44:13.860
You need some beautiful locations
for your photography sessions.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.440
There's a cavern, very picturesque...

44:16.560 --> 44:19.260
halfway between the city and the fortress.

44:19.360 --> 44:23.220
Swell, we can ask Bartos
to give us a lift.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.400
What a marvelous idea, Mr Thornton.

44:29.680 --> 44:34.660
The caverns will make a superb location
for your collection.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.340
They really are quite impressive.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.329
Credit Ana with the idea.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.609
I was only looking
for a unique background.

44:45.440 --> 44:49.980
Unique they are. In the morning,
I shall instruct my secretary

44:50.080 --> 44:52.700
to keep the caverns open
for the entire day.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.980
Darling, can you spare Louis for the day?

44:55.080 --> 44:59.820
Certainly, but I'm not sure
that that will be sufficient.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.620
Mr Thornton, if you don't mind too much,

45:02.720 --> 45:05.660
I should like to send along
some handpicked men with you

45:05.760 --> 45:07.740
since they know the area well.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.940
You will be staying in a town nearby

45:11.040 --> 45:14.260
they can supply you
with anything you might need.

45:14.360 --> 45:17.523
Thank you. I'm in your debt.

45:18.720 --> 45:21.660
You fascinate me, Mr Thornton.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.900
In what way, Mr Bartos?

45:24.000 --> 45:29.006
In the way that you surround
your whole life with beautiful women,

45:30.440 --> 45:34.525
but you never avail yourself
of their delights.

45:39.840 --> 45:43.700
Forgive my naivety,
but I find this very strange,

45:43.800 --> 45:45.860
very unusual.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.620
So did my parents.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.370
And yet you say...

45:50.520 --> 45:54.220
you find my Ana very beautiful.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.940
Please forgive me,

45:56.040 --> 46:00.660
but my sensual tastes
lie in other areas, so to speak.

46:00.760 --> 46:03.500
Oh, that's a pity, Mr Thornton.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.080
You see, men are crude.

46:07.160 --> 46:09.740
Too violent.

46:09.840 --> 46:12.300
Their lovemaking has force.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.528
I'll buy that.

46:17.360 --> 46:22.321
Most of us lack a certain gentility.

46:23.560 --> 46:27.804
In our lovemaking, in our affections.

46:29.520 --> 46:34.660
You see, we need women in our lives.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.700
To give us balance.

46:36.800 --> 46:41.840
Their softness soothes us,
calms us, makes us feel safe.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.980
And their delights, they are boundless.

46:47.080 --> 46:50.687
Now, you be honest with me, Mr Thornton.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.123
Do you not feel something now?

46:56.520 --> 46:59.410
Do you not feel passion?

47:00.560 --> 47:02.961
Is there nothing here that you want?

47:04.240 --> 47:06.540
Yes...

47:06.640 --> 47:09.100
- Yes, there is.
- And what would that be?

47:09.200 --> 47:11.407
Another glass of wine.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.083
Ana, my darling,

47:16.080 --> 47:23.567
I think it is time that you left
Mr Thornton and I alone.

47:39.680 --> 47:42.365
Live and let live.

48:02.600 --> 48:06.980
Michael, if you have anything
to say to me,

48:07.080 --> 48:09.208
now is the time.

48:15.600 --> 48:18.020
Louis!

48:18.120 --> 48:25.004
Louis. Take Mr Thornton back to his hotel.

48:36.320 --> 48:38.620
You all right, Mr Ryan?

48:38.720 --> 48:42.260
I'm fine, Louis. Pass me the phone.

48:42.360 --> 48:44.681
Be careful, it is bugged.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.220
- Hello?
- 'Did I wake you up, Dad?'

48:54.320 --> 48:56.340
Cecil, how are you?

48:56.440 --> 49:00.700
Wonderful, you wouldn't believe
how incredibly beautiful this country is.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.660
The new line was a smash.

49:02.760 --> 49:05.540
I'll be coming back
with a pile of exciting photos.

49:05.640 --> 49:08.980
I expect to blast them to "Vogue"
and "Marie Claire" simultaneously.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.500
Excellent, how about "Cosmo"?

49:11.600 --> 49:15.140
'Haven't made contact yet
but I'm sure they'll die to have me.'

49:15.240 --> 49:20.140
I'm calling about my reservations
at the Intercontinental in Athens.

49:20.240 --> 49:23.900
Yes, you want to give me
those flight numbers again?

49:24.000 --> 49:28.260
Yeah. TWA flight 492...

49:28.360 --> 49:32.580
two seats, first class.
I'd like the presidential suite.

49:32.680 --> 49:35.260
Number 959...

49:35.360 --> 49:42.300
Return flight TWA 321,
arriving in New York at 6:45pm.

49:42.400 --> 49:45.180
That's just fine. How are the girls?

49:45.280 --> 49:48.620
- Like a million bucks.
- Fine, you take care of yourself.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.291
Kiss mother for me.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.282
Hello?

51:04.400 --> 51:07.051
Too many coins. Long distance, right?

51:08.960 --> 51:11.440
Boyfriend back home, maybe...

51:12.840 --> 51:15.844
But why didn't she just use
the phone in her room?

51:32.720 --> 51:35.803
Come on, chatterbox, let's hit the hay.

51:44.240 --> 51:46.060
Listen up.

51:46.160 --> 51:49.180
Don't underestimate these guys.
They're no ordinary soldiers.

51:49.280 --> 51:52.284
They're professional killers,
every one of 'em.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.300
Synchronize your watches.

51:55.400 --> 51:58.820
We'll hit them at exactly 12:00 hours.

51:58.920 --> 52:01.400
Right, nice. That's it.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.682
Good.

52:24.200 --> 52:26.441
Yes, more of that.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.020
That's it, girls.

52:55.120 --> 52:57.009
Take a break.

52:58.160 --> 52:59.889
Ten minutes.

53:05.880 --> 53:09.043
Good, that's it.

53:26.680 --> 53:29.729
Come on baby, you wanna play?

53:32.720 --> 53:34.860
Hold still, handsome,

53:34.960 --> 53:39.363
because I'm about to give you
the best close-up you've ever had.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.606
- What happened?
- I don't know.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.860
- Joanna!
- 'I'm over here. I'm fine.'

54:29.960 --> 54:32.740
- Cindy!
- 'Daphne and I are OK.'

54:32.840 --> 54:35.780
I can see Katrina from here.

54:35.880 --> 54:37.848
Sheila!

54:39.280 --> 54:41.020
Sheila!

54:43.080 --> 54:44.780
Sheila!

54:59.920 --> 55:01.684
Where'd she go?

56:01.320 --> 56:02.685
Goodbye, Sheila.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.088
We'll miss you.

56:08.640 --> 56:12.645
You're still alive. Keep it that way.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.060
You lost a friend. I'm sorry.

56:20.160 --> 56:24.620
- I lost a soldier. I can't afford that.
- The mercenary spirit again, eh?

56:24.720 --> 56:28.805
That's what you're paying for.
You're getting your money's worth.

56:45.040 --> 56:48.780
These are the Moravia mountains.
On the other side is rebel territory.

56:48.880 --> 56:50.928
We cross, we're safe.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.564
Dahlia?

57:03.720 --> 57:05.980
You're in charge now.

57:06.080 --> 57:09.402
Remember our conversation?
I'm putting you in charge

57:09.520 --> 57:12.900
because you're trained and disciplined.
That doesn't mean I'm not watching you.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.220
I don't think you're crazy enough
to shoot me in the back.

57:16.320 --> 57:20.140
If you get any funny ideas, remember...
I'm faster and better.

57:20.240 --> 57:23.210
- How do you know?
- I get the big bucks.

58:04.680 --> 58:05.900
Wait.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.446
From now on, be very careful.

58:08.560 --> 58:11.940
The rebels have planted land mines.
No one knows where.

58:12.040 --> 58:15.060
Oh great, now we're going to play
leapfrog in a mine field.

58:15.160 --> 58:17.128
Louis, point.

58:45.240 --> 58:46.860
Freeze!

58:46.960 --> 58:50.540
Katrina, don't move! Everybody back off!

58:50.640 --> 58:52.860
Get me some big rocks.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.200
Louis, no!

59:06.960 --> 59:09.660
- That was stupid!
- Piece of pie.

59:09.760 --> 59:13.100
It's piece of cake, schmuck!
You're lucky that fuse went off late

59:13.200 --> 59:16.980
- or you'd be hamburger right now.
- Jesus, Ryan, give him a break.

59:17.080 --> 59:20.820
- He's a brave guy.
- Fuck brave! Brave is for fairy tales!

59:20.920 --> 59:23.220
- This is real.
- You are such a sweetheart.

59:23.320 --> 59:25.607
Now move!

59:31.320 --> 59:34.580
Is it all right with you if we leave now,
Miss Ratowsky?

59:34.680 --> 59:37.940
- She is not...
- I don't need any shit from you, hero.

59:38.040 --> 59:39.451
Now move!

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.248
Come on, come over. The food is ready.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.100
Everything they have. Are you happy now?

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.328
Not bad for a bunch of raghead rebels.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.020
He was a corporal in the army
when the colonels took over.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.180
Deserted and took
some of his men to the mountains.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.569
He says you're welcome to use his tent.
It doesn't have many comforts.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.140
That'll all change, as soon as
he's cut a few throats and taken power.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.447
He won't have to live in a tent and...

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.340
he'll be taking two baths a day
in Bartos' own tub.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:14.048
Ladies, get some sleep. You've earned it.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.330
Did he just do what I think he did?

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.900
I think so.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.500
Son of a bitch... He smiled.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.409
Thanks.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.700
- Need something?
- I wanted to apologize.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.020
No need. If I can be tough on you,
you can be tough on me.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.700
I also wanted to thank you
for coming on our side.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.700
I had good motivation. My paycheck.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.860
- Get some sleep.
- I'm not tired.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.140
Pump iron. Get tired. Get some sleep.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.020
So, you're a cynic. What else?

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.762
Lady, you got an appetite for heavy
duty conversation and I'm beat.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.620
Underneath, you do care, don't you?

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.700
Let me give you a brief lesson in caring.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.900
Man kills for money and power.
That's the way it has always been.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.700
That's the way it'll always be.
Causes, revolutions, country.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.620
It's all icing on the cake.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.700
Watch your revolutionary buddies
when they're in charge.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.500
They'll kill each other and probably you
for money and power.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.300
What a wonderful world
and what an inspired speech.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.085
Hey, what did you expect?

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.660
I'm a hired hand, that's all.
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.740
Some of us are paid
to fight other peoples' wars.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.164
Some of us are paid to sleep
with pigs like Michael Bartos.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.100
- You're hurting me.
- I thought you liked to hurt.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.780
Stop!

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.940
We're all whores, Miss Perry.
We just sell it in different ways.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.060
I love this country. You love no one!

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.940
You have nothing
and nobody gives a shit about you.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.220
I got news for you. There ain't a country
in this entire stinking universe

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.060
that gives a rat's ass
about you or your stupid ideals!

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.370
If you believe otherwise, you're either
too naive or too dumb or both.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.724
Ah!

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.045
- Excuse me.
- What's wrong?

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.524
Damn.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.203
Damn!

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.683
Get my helicopter to me.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.970
That is where we are going, Frank.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.260
Name's Ryan.

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:23.170
No problem. Piece of tart.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.100
Louis, which way to the old building?

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.690
It's there.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.820
Sivi, take care of the fireworks.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.780
Dahlia, you and Katrina
take care of the sentries.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.202
Be silent, be quick, no wake up calls.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.410
Joanna, you and Daphne cover our flanks.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.563
Ana, you stay with me.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.721
If these clowns haven't seen any women
for a while, they're gonna have a ball.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.220
How long before we're in range?

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.402
15 minutes, sir!

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.820
Start transmitting!

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.685
Mayday, Mayday.
Cobra, Caravan Tango X-Ray.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.620
Cobra, this is Caravan Tango X-Ray.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.940
I cannot read your signals.
Very weak... over.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.180
Mayday, Cobra to Caravan. Tango X-Ray.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.340
Come in, please, over.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.011
'Come in...'

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.500
Come in Tango X-Ray.
Come in, please, do you read me? Over.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.820
Sorry love, wrong number.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.900
No response, sir.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.004
The damn fools must still be asleep, huh?

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.931
Bastards!

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.980
- Nice work, Scalpieri.
- Piece of cake.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.730
Louis, is this it?

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:51.443
Yes, two floors. Some 100, 125 rooms.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.060
- Katrina with Dahlia.
- Joanna and Daphne.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.403
Louis with Ana.
I'll take the second floor.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.410
Watch for booby traps.
Don't get trigger happy.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.922
Let's go!

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.340
He's not in the building.
Maybe there is no Brother.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.180
He's here, I know it.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.300
You're gonna have a shitload of pissed off
soldiers on your ass. You up for that?

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.164
Yes.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.500
- Where else would they keep him?
- There are some hidden rooms.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.841
I think I can find him.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.220
This little piggy went to market...

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.620
And this little piggy stayed at home...

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.060
This little piggy had roast beef...

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.340
And this little piggy...

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.900
had none.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.020
And all the other piggies...

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.780
went to hell!

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.220
There it is.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.685
I'll do it.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.520
You two, go that way.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.128
Stay here.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.780
Keep an eye on the alley.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.660
- Ana, go back with the girls.
- I'm staying with you.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.240
That's an order. Move!

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.540
'Hell of a lot of effort
for just one guy, isn't it?

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.820
'There is one additional matter.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.980
'A degree of concern has been
raised by my clients...

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.860
'as to Rallis' ability to lead a revolution
after his long imprisonment.

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.406
'If such were the case,
it wouldn't serve our purpose.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.205
- 'What are you saying?'
- 'We'd like him eliminated.'

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.440
'It's better for their revolution.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.562
'It's better for us.'

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.020
- Petros Rallis?
- The underground sent you?

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.860
I don't work for them. Name's Ryan.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.042
American?

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.900
Are you to be my liberator, Mr Ryan?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.620
Something like that.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.140
So, the choice has been made for me...

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.766
My freedom or my death.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.300
Perhaps the revolution does need a martyr.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.820
My people remember me
as I was 15 years ago.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.340
This will... spare them
any disappointment.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.220
I'm sorry.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:59.820
We are both soldiers, Mr Ryan.
We have our duties.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.400
Do yours.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.006
My life for the revolution.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.161
It seems an even trade.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.646
'It's better for their revolution.
It's better for us.'

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.130
Ana.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.248
Drop it.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.580
Amazing what greed does, huh kid?

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:02.780
Thomas sent you here
to take Ryan and us out

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.900
just to spare himself some small change?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.402
He ruined your life.
Now, you want to save his?

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.842
- He's a hired hand.
- I never bite the hand that feeds me.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.500
Hey!

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.340
That way's no good. It leads straight to the
tower where that son-of-a-bitch sniper is.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.161
- Can't go back. Nasty bird out there.
- This way.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.980
We'll have to take the sniper. You stay.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.570
Come on.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.180
I ever tell you about the time
I pitched a shutout?

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.980
California prison league '84.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.923
Cover me!

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.051
Shit!

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.220
- There's something you gotta know.
- Say it fast.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.120
Daphne worked for Thomas.
She was hired to kill us.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.500
- How long have you known?
- Doesn't matter.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.843
Great. That means
there's no way out of here.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.765
Let's go!

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.580
Louis, you and Ana stay
with the old man. Play it safe.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.001
We're gonna get us some wheels.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.980
This way.

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.969
Now!

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.446
Ryan!

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.962
Come on, move it!

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.926
He's all yours!

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.700
You do a mean fandango, Mr Bartos.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.407
It's been real fun,
but we gotta leave. See ya.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.660
But don't worry,
you're not gonna get lonely.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.161
We're leaving you in good hands.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.500
This country is in your debt, Mr Ryan.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.409
Mine and everybody else's.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:12.100
Happy birthday to you

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:16.540
Happy birthday, Mr Thomas

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:22.100
Happy birthday to you

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.002
Happy birthday, Mr Thomas.
