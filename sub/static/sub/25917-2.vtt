'cause I've been doing it.

37:19.310 --> 37:21.517
Jenni, stop-- like,
I'm tired of everyone
telling me what I'm not--

37:21.586 --> 37:23.482
like, I've been going
through hell.We don't know.

37:23.551 --> 37:25.896
[Ronnie]
So stop to, like--
I'm, like, so, like--

37:25.965 --> 37:28.034
I'm going through hell with her.
That's your [bleep] friend.

37:28.103 --> 37:29.896
She tells you
what you wanna hear.She's not my friend, bro.

37:29.965 --> 37:31.793
Whatever.
She tells you
what you wanna hear.

37:31.862 --> 37:33.379
The things that he does,

37:33.448 --> 37:36.655
he's worried about his child
being... taken away.

37:36.724 --> 37:38.517
Taken away, Jenni.
Like you said, like, away.

37:38.586 --> 37:40.413
Hold up, hold on.
Really?

37:40.482 --> 37:43.379
So why the [bleep]
are you on Instagram,
trying to bait her as well?

37:43.448 --> 37:46.344
When you go to Instagram
and put that [bleep]
out there for free,

37:46.413 --> 37:48.586
for millions of people
to see--Yeah, let it-- let it--

37:48.655 --> 37:51.034
You're justifying her.
Listen, I didn't say--I'm not justifying her.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.241
Every move I make,

37:52.310 --> 37:55.103
I'm scared that my child
is gonna be gone.

37:55.172 --> 37:57.896
Everything I've said has
[bleep] been on egg shells!

37:57.965 --> 37:59.517
Egg [bleep] shells!

37:59.586 --> 38:01.620
It's so I can see
my [bleep] daughter!

38:01.689 --> 38:05.206
It's not right,
but it is what it [bleep] is!

38:05.275 --> 38:09.655
This [bleep] is insane 'cause I
could never imagine Roger

38:09.724 --> 38:12.206
or anyone saying
I can't see my kids.

38:12.275 --> 38:13.689
'Cause I would go for blood.

38:13.758 --> 38:15.896
Do you want
my honest opinion?

38:15.965 --> 38:19.586
Leave her and fight
for your daughter,
and then go get help.

38:19.655 --> 38:21.448
Go to the court.
Go get a lawyer.

38:21.517 --> 38:24.068
How easy that for you.

38:24.137 --> 38:26.068
It's not easy!
It's not easy!It's easy for you to say.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.551
[bleep], just let it go.
Just, [bleep], hey,
that's what it is, right?

38:28.620 --> 38:31.448
Not let-- let what go?
That relationship?
This relationship?

38:31.517 --> 38:34.172
No, my [bleep] bond I have
with my [bleep] kid, Jenni!

38:34.241 --> 38:36.206
The bond I have
with my [bleep] kid!
Ron--

38:36.275 --> 38:38.000
You've never had
a conversation with anyone

38:38.068 --> 38:39.517
that's having a bond
with their [bleep] kid!It sucks.

38:39.586 --> 38:41.655
I have a bond with my kid!
You don't know!

38:41.724 --> 38:43.862
I love my [bleep] son,
who can't speak!

38:43.931 --> 38:46.310
Oh, my God, but you go home.
But you have that comfort--

38:46.379 --> 38:48.310
One month--You have that comfort
of going--

38:48.379 --> 38:50.241
There's no comfort!Yes, it is!

38:50.310 --> 38:51.896
You have the comfort
of knowing that Roger
is gonna be--

38:51.965 --> 38:54.724
I have nothing to go home to!
I have no house!

38:54.793 --> 38:56.448
I have nothing!You chose that life.

38:56.517 --> 38:58.482
Oh, my God.
I chose that life.You chose that life.

38:58.551 --> 39:00.103
I got pregnant by somebody
that I chose.Yeah, it's the [bleep] life.

39:00.172 --> 39:02.206
Yeah, well, I [bleep] chose
that life, Jenni.

39:02.275 --> 39:03.551
Okay.
[bleep]!

39:03.620 --> 39:06.000
Ronnie, he finally started
opening up to us,

39:06.068 --> 39:08.448
and we see all the demons
coming out.

39:08.517 --> 39:10.965
We're all kind of bracing
ourselves for impact.

39:11.034 --> 39:12.620
Ron, you gotta take
responsibility, dude.No, [bleep]--

39:12.689 --> 39:14.655
You have to [bleep] take it.I've been owning
my [bleep], right?

39:14.724 --> 39:16.068
You [bleep] a crazy bitch!I've been owning my [bleep]!

39:16.137 --> 39:18.586
You got
a crazy bitch pregnant!
