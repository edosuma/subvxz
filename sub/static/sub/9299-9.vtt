I don't like quinoa. It's too grainy.

It's not a grain. It's a chenopod.

- Well, I don't like "keenopads."
- Chenopod.

00:49.342 --> 00:54.045
Quinoa is closely related to
beets, spinach, and tumbleweed.

- Well, I can't back out now.

to do this presentation six months ago.

thinking about Hoyt.

Well, you presented a unique challenge
to someone like Charles Hoyt.

that he tried to kill me?

The first is the West Roxbury mansion,
where we found Martin Yeager's body.

His wife, Gail, was missing,
but we found evidence of a second body

01:40.944 --> 01:44.213

Gail's body in a remote area.

enough that he's a serial killer.

me to do something like this.

Dr. Nolan, what is forensic
psychiatry, exactly?

It's a branch of
medicine that focuses on

03:48.405 --> 03:50.739
the intersection of
law and mental health.

03:50.773 --> 03:54.343
And why did you decide to
specialize in serial killers?

<i>- Mom.
- It's all right. I get asked that a lot.</i>

Tell me.

36:03.053 --> 36:07.223
They said he'd been abandoned
at my father's office,

36:07.258 --> 36:12.396
- and they put him up for adoption.
- I'm sorry.

36:14.031 --> 36:16.566
<i>Yeah. [ Puppy whimpers ]</i>

36:21.606 --> 36:22.906
<i>Hello.</i>

36:27.745 --> 36:30.814
Do you know that you
can desensitize a child

36:30.848 --> 36:33.149
by having him practice violent behavior?

36:33.184 --> 36:36.653
Makes sense. Is that
what you did to Jack?

36:36.688 --> 36:41.591
When I finally found him, yes.

36:41.626 --> 36:47.130
Remember when you were 5...
and I taught you how to kill a puppy?

36:48.899 --> 36:51.034
Yeah, mom.

36:51.068 --> 36:54.338
- I do.
- Don't.

36:56.106 --> 36:58.608
We're not here for the puppy.

36:58.643 --> 37:00.210
We're here for you.

37:06.865 --> 37:09.583
Ok, thank you. 

37:09.584 --> 37:11.517
That 14-year-old
girl who witnessed

37:11.552 --> 37:13.553
<i>her parents' double murder
went into foster care.</i>

37:13.588 --> 37:16.856
- Why do you look so ominous?
- Because she changed her name

37:16.891 --> 37:20.493
- from Tory Appleton to Victoria Nolan.
- Oh, my god.

37:20.527 --> 37:22.862
- It's Dr. Nolan?
- Yeah.

37:22.897 --> 37:25.799
How? I... She was with us
when the murders occurred.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.968
She has a partner.

37:28.002 --> 37:30.704
68% of female serial
killers kill in teams.

37:30.738 --> 37:32.672
Where did you get that from?

37:34.041 --> 37:38.044
- Her introduction.
- Where is she right now?

37:38.079 --> 37:41.081
Uh, she's gonna be at the
symposium in 30 minutes.

37:41.115 --> 37:43.316
- Korsak's not back yet?
- Yeah, where is he?

37:43.350 --> 37:45.318
He's taking his sweet time today.

37:45.352 --> 37:47.721
Maybe he's getting
a little more than puppy love.

37:47.755 --> 37:49.022
What do you mean?

37:50.057 --> 37:53.159
What? He and Dr. Nolan went back
to his house to feed his dog.

37:54.461 --> 37:55.895
Frost.

37:58.265 --> 38:04.170
- Jack, use the carbon-steel scalpel.
- All right.

38:05.973 --> 38:08.241
- You trained him well.
- Haven't I?

38:08.308 --> 38:10.610
I let him do the last three on his own.

38:10.678 --> 38:13.312
- How many have you done together?
- Not enough.

38:13.347 --> 38:18.384
- Tell him what we have planned.
- Charles Hoyt preferred to go

38:18.418 --> 38:21.387
between the palmar interosseous bones.

38:21.421 --> 38:22.789
<i>Like he did with Jane.</i>

38:22.823 --> 38:26.693
But David felt it was more
painful to split the ulna

38:26.761 --> 38:28.895
- and the radius bones.
- Don't make your son do this.

38:28.963 --> 38:32.194
I don't make him do it.
He enjoys it.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.701
<i>Oh, I do.</i>

38:34.735 --> 38:37.771
I have so many good memories
of doing this with my mom.

38:37.805 --> 38:40.907
This isn't random.
This is personal.

38:40.941 --> 38:45.611
Yes, it is. I hold you responsible
for what happened to Charles.

38:45.646 --> 38:47.280
<i>[ Gunshot ]</i>

38:52.086 --> 38:54.220
<i>Korsak: A little help down here!</i>

38:54.254 --> 38:57.490
You cut his work short.
He had so much left to do.

38:57.524 --> 39:02.302
It's time.
Jack, give me his gun.

39:02.337 --> 39:05.531
Charles taught me guns
ruin the experience.

39:05.566 --> 39:08.134
How many?

39:08.169 --> 39:10.837
Murders?
Oh, it's crass to count.

39:10.871 --> 39:14.007
We don't brand them all.
It'd make it too easy.

39:14.041 --> 39:16.876
But we'll brand you.
Not yet.

39:16.911 --> 39:20.346
- Take the scalpel.
- Yes, I know the sequence.

39:23.184 --> 39:25.151
Carbon steel...

39:25.186 --> 39:27.887
<i>Why do you let her tell you what to do?</i>

39:28.122 --> 39:30.456
She doesn't tell me what to do.

39:30.490 --> 39:33.159
- Stop wasting time, Jack.
- Sorry, mom.

39:33.194 --> 39:34.961
And here I thought you were
doing this all by yourself.

39:36.130 --> 39:39.232
Obviously. You've been at the
crime scenes. You've seen my work.

39:39.266 --> 39:42.135
No. What I've seen is your
mother telling you what to do.

39:42.169 --> 39:43.302
His hands, Jack, now.

39:43.370 --> 39:45.371
- All right!
- How old are you? 25?

39:45.405 --> 39:47.440
- You let your mother tell you what to do?
- Finish it!

39:47.474 --> 39:48.674
Yeah, I'd never put up with that.

39:48.709 --> 39:50.543
- Shut up!
- You telling me or you telling her?!

39:50.577 --> 39:52.912
- I said finish it!
- Shut up!

39:53.967 --> 39:55.305
[ Gunshot ]

39:55.883 --> 39:57.851
Now look what you made me do!

39:59.092 --> 40:00.940
[ Gunshot ]
Ah.

40:01.889 --> 40:03.890
Don't move, you piece of crap.

40:03.924 --> 40:05.058
- Korsak: Call an ambulance.
- Jane: You okay?

40:05.126 --> 40:07.861
Not for me, for them.
There's bolt cutters in that tool bag.

40:07.895 --> 40:10.529
Yeah, I need E.M.S.
at 6424 Dorchester Avenue.

40:10.597 --> 40:15.568
Oh, let him die.
He's always reminded me of my father.

40:15.602 --> 40:19.472
- Make her walk, Frost.
- Come on.

40:19.539 --> 40:20.640
[ Grunts ]

40:26.413 --> 40:29.448
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

40:29.483 --> 40:33.686
- I am glad to see you, though.
- Well, I always did want to rescue you.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.088
[ Chuckles ]

40:35.122 --> 40:36.756
<i>[ Sirens wail ]</i>

40:37.465 --> 40:39.125
<i>Come on.</i>

40:42.518 --> 40:45.364
Oh. Pretty cold, huh?

40:45.399 --> 40:47.267
Her telling us to let her son die.

40:47.334 --> 40:50.170
Psychopaths are incapable
of forming relationships.

40:50.204 --> 40:52.305
Poor kid.

40:52.339 --> 40:55.008
That "poor kid" hit you
in the head with a 2x4.

40:55.042 --> 40:58.136
He was gonna drive
a scalpel through you.

40:58.940 --> 41:02.129
I'd shot him to the nuts,
if he'd hurt my dogs. {*started transcript}

41:05.208 --> 41:09.554
We really like your porch, Sergeant.
It's nice to have a porch.

41:09.719 --> 41:11.615
Yeah, you can check there
your neighbours.

41:11.978 --> 41:15.456
- Got a keen lungs?
- Yeah, three sisters live next door.

41:15.620 --> 41:18.992
- Your age or our age?
- Who knock, check to yourself.

41:19.388 --> 41:20.907
[ Chuckles ]

41:21.346 --> 41:23.590
It's nice to finally see you laugh...

41:23.733 --> 41:25.693
It's nice to having you.
Next time bring some food.

41:25.862 --> 41:28.230
<i>[ All chuckles ]
Yeah...</i>
