00:42.141 --> 00:43.842
- All right.
- All right.

00:44.842 --> 00:46.546
Oh, my God.

00:47.812 --> 00:48.815
Come on.

00:53.418 --> 00:54.950
Hello.

00:54.952 --> 00:57.420
Hey!

00:57.422 --> 00:59.623
Hey, sis! You made it.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.791
- Oh, yes, I did.
- Mmm!

01:01.793 --> 01:04.660
- Hey.
- Will, you look good.

01:04.662 --> 01:06.495
Oh, I didn't know
you were helping!

01:06.497 --> 01:08.764
- Yes, I wanted to.
- Aw.

01:08.766 --> 01:11.133
Renee has been right here,
helping us with Mama and Daddy.

01:11.135 --> 01:12.405
Oh, stop.

01:12.971 --> 01:14.204
What's up, what's up?

01:14.206 --> 01:15.508
Ah.

01:16.441 --> 01:18.541
Well, hey there,
little brother.

01:18.543 --> 01:19.843
- What's up?
- Uh-huh.

01:19.845 --> 01:21.581
- You lookin' happy.
- All right, all right.

01:22.214 --> 01:24.147
I am. I'm engaged.

01:24.149 --> 01:26.819
- Oh, well, congrats!
- Thank you.

01:29.754 --> 01:31.787
Yeah, she clearly
ain't too fond of her.

01:31.789 --> 01:33.623
- How'd you meet her?
- She works with A.J.

01:33.625 --> 01:35.027
And he's not too fond
of her either.

01:35.793 --> 01:37.828
Hey, congrats, man.

01:37.830 --> 01:38.965
Thank you.

01:39.965 --> 01:41.564
I'll tell you
about it later.

01:41.566 --> 01:43.233
I'm sure you will.

01:43.235 --> 01:45.734
Wow, this looks great.

01:45.736 --> 01:47.169
Renee brought the flowers.

01:47.171 --> 01:48.838
Oh! Mama's gonna love these.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.906
She will.

01:49.908 --> 01:52.108
- Mmm.
- Daddy, too.

01:52.110 --> 01:53.909
Thank you so much
for helping us, Renee.

01:53.911 --> 01:56.546
I would do anything
for your mama and daddy.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.248
- I love 'em so much.
- I know.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.716
You always have.

01:59.718 --> 02:02.017
So, are you picking up
the cake?

02:02.019 --> 02:04.987
No. Uncle Heathrow said he got
somebody to take care of it.

02:04.989 --> 02:07.591
What?
No. No way. Oh, no.

02:07.593 --> 02:09.657
- No. That's not happening.
- What's wrong?

02:09.660 --> 02:11.026
You know he's half-crazy.

02:11.029 --> 02:12.031
I heard that.

02:13.665 --> 02:16.066
Uncle Heathrow!
Who's picking up the cake?

02:16.068 --> 02:17.100
Don't worry about it.

02:17.102 --> 02:19.235
I wanted to do something,
so I got it covered.

02:19.237 --> 02:20.939
Oh, okay.

02:22.808 --> 02:25.175
We can't let him get that cake.

02:25.177 --> 02:28.144
How about you pick up
the crackers?

02:28.146 --> 02:29.778
I'm bringing the cake.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.080
Let him do it.

02:31.082 --> 02:33.283
It's their anniversary.
It's too important.

02:33.285 --> 02:34.717
Give him something to do.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.219
The cake will be
sexually explicit. No!

02:36.221 --> 02:39.955
You right, it will be sexually explicit.
I want a old chick on a cat.

02:39.957 --> 02:41.758
That's it.

02:41.760 --> 02:42.892
I'm calling Donovan.

02:42.894 --> 02:44.596
Okay. We'll just
have a backup.

02:45.763 --> 02:47.229
Of course.

02:47.231 --> 02:51.166
So, is this fiancee of yours
coming to the anniversary party?

02:51.168 --> 02:52.235
Yes.

02:52.237 --> 02:54.037
Good. We'll get
to meet her, then.

02:54.039 --> 02:55.872
That's right. Thank you.

02:55.874 --> 02:57.073
And you,

02:57.075 --> 02:58.775
don't start with me, okay?

02:58.777 --> 02:59.909
I won't.

02:59.911 --> 03:01.681
Uh-huh. Or her, either.

03:02.681 --> 03:04.180
Thank you.

03:04.182 --> 03:06.716
You know, she's just always
looking out for us.

03:06.718 --> 03:07.984
I know.

03:07.986 --> 03:09.721
Sometimes too much.

03:10.821 --> 03:13.156
Hey, somebody need
to wash their ass.

03:13.158 --> 03:15.291
Did he just say that?

03:15.293 --> 03:17.826
Girl, you know him.
He always says what's on his mind.

03:17.828 --> 03:19.229
I don't know,
he kinda funny.

03:19.231 --> 03:22.198
When you jacked-up like this,
all you can do is laugh, and hump,

03:22.200 --> 03:24.935
- and screw.
- Hey, Uncle Heathrow.

03:24.937 --> 03:26.235
Hey. How are you?

03:26.237 --> 03:27.304
I'm good.

03:27.306 --> 03:29.605
Okay, great. Who are you?

03:29.607 --> 03:31.974
I'm Sylvia,
your granddaughter?

03:31.976 --> 03:34.513
And that's
my husband, Will.

03:36.582 --> 03:38.281
You just ruined
a crippled man dream.

03:38.283 --> 03:39.619
Oh!

03:40.851 --> 03:42.652
Is Madea and Joe here yet?

03:42.654 --> 03:43.819
You invited them?

03:43.821 --> 03:45.354
Hell, yes, I did.

03:45.356 --> 03:47.790
This is supposed
to be for family.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.960
They are family.
You married into this.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.160
You are not family.

03:51.162 --> 03:53.663
- You a in-law.
- Yeah, they should be here.

03:53.665 --> 03:55.198
You know how
Daddy feels about them.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.866
Hey, they're still family.
And they're funny.

03:57.868 --> 04:00.203
If you say so.

04:00.205 --> 04:02.639
Look, this is
a special anniversary.

04:02.641 --> 04:05.975
Oh, anniversary is crazy.
Don't ever get married.

04:05.977 --> 04:07.877
That's a waste of time.

04:07.879 --> 04:09.778
Well, uh, I'm getting married.

04:09.780 --> 04:13.783
Oh, congratulations.
What's his name?

04:13.785 --> 04:15.718
I ain't gay, Uncle Heathrow.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.620
Then why are your pants
so tight?

04:18.790 --> 04:21.824
That's it.
Get out. Out!

04:21.826 --> 04:22.925
That's it, son.

04:22.927 --> 04:24.728
Get out. Of the closet.

04:25.764 --> 04:28.732
Look, I have a beautiful
fiancee, all right?

04:28.734 --> 04:31.634
And you will get a chance
to meet her this weekend.

04:31.636 --> 04:34.704
And I love her, just like
you loved our grandmother.

04:34.706 --> 04:36.773
I was so happy
when she died.

04:36.775 --> 04:40.644
Losing my legs was easier
than dealing with her every day.

04:40.646 --> 04:42.911
And she smelled
like sanitation.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.648
Okay, stop that.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.348
Who are you calling?

04:46.350 --> 04:48.218
That better not be
a drug dealer.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.920
Hello. Yeah, I'm running low
on my prescription.

04:50.922 --> 04:52.155
I mean it!

04:53.258 --> 04:55.190
What are you saying?

04:55.192 --> 04:57.996
You better get your ass away
from me 'fore I mess you up.

05:01.966 --> 05:03.932
- Ah, God damn.
- Who that?

05:03.934 --> 05:05.802
Oh, Lord. It's Heathrow.

05:05.804 --> 05:07.336
That's our brother.
Answer the phone.

05:07.338 --> 05:10.173
I don't like talking
to Heathrow on the phone.

05:10.175 --> 05:11.940
That thing he talk with,

05:11.942 --> 05:14.177
- it be vibrating my ears.
- Okay. Mmm.

05:14.179 --> 05:16.745
Make my ear about
to have a orgasm.

05:16.747 --> 05:17.913
Well, give me the phone,
let me answer it.

05:17.915 --> 05:19.216
No, no, no.

05:19.218 --> 05:22.752
We don't wanna see or hear you have a orgasm.

05:22.754 --> 05:25.988
Ain't that the truth.
Ain't that the damn truth. Not up in here.

05:25.990 --> 05:28.324
Still don't hear her
have no organism.

05:28.326 --> 05:31.194
Now, I don't know about that,
Bam, you might not...

05:31.196 --> 05:32.829
I might wanna see that.

05:32.831 --> 05:34.831
Joe.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.966
That's Heathrow.
Heathrow calling me again.

05:36.968 --> 05:38.033
Joe, go on
and get the phone.

05:38.035 --> 05:40.403
I'mma put it on speaker
'cause I don't wanna...

05:40.405 --> 05:41.471
Hello?

05:41.473 --> 05:42.906
Y'all on the way?

05:42.908 --> 05:45.307
- Oh!
- See how that feel?

05:45.309 --> 05:46.776
That do tickle.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.478
- Wait.
- Don't even feel right, do it?

05:48.480 --> 05:50.280
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, he can hear me.

05:50.282 --> 05:52.148
That's making
my nipples hard.

05:52.150 --> 05:54.249
Oh, yeah, we over
at Brian's house,

05:54.251 --> 05:56.452
waiting for him to get here
so he can drive us over there.

05:56.454 --> 05:58.288
Why can't you drive yourself?

05:58.290 --> 06:00.256
I have some vibration going on.

06:00.258 --> 06:02.492
You know I ain't got
no damn driver license.

06:02.494 --> 06:04.127
Ain't none of us
got no driver license.

06:04.129 --> 06:05.795
<i>We can't drive that far here.</i>

06:05.797 --> 06:06.963
Well, I'm here.

06:06.965 --> 06:10.733
Well, I know, Heathrow.
You can't go nowhere too far.

06:10.735 --> 06:12.802
If your battery dead,
you can't go nowhere.

06:12.804 --> 06:15.805
Okay, when you come, bring me
some of that good-good.

06:15.807 --> 06:17.940
Heathrow, you done had that
cancer from all that smoking.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.442
That's how you got
that hole in your throat.

06:19.444 --> 06:21.043
<i>You ain't supposed to be
smoking nothing.</i>

06:21.045 --> 06:23.045
Well, we all gonna
die from something.

06:23.047 --> 06:25.115
This fool crazy.
He getting ready to die.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.249
I'm looking at a few girls

06:26.251 --> 06:28.985
planning to kill a few men,
if you know what I mean.

06:28.987 --> 06:30.853
You still on the
phone with Uncle Joe?

06:30.855 --> 06:32.288
<i>I'm talking
to one of my hoes.</i>

06:32.290 --> 06:34.257
All right, fine,
I'll see you when you get there.

06:34.259 --> 06:35.524
<i>Get off that phone!</i>

06:35.526 --> 06:38.127
I can't stand his ass
sometimes, you know.

06:38.129 --> 06:40.963
- He just always that...
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

06:40.965 --> 06:42.999
Oh, you here.
All right, hang on...

06:43.001 --> 06:45.000
I wasn't talking about you.

06:45.002 --> 06:46.836
I wasn't talking
about you at all.

06:46.838 --> 06:48.137
I'll see you
when you get here.

06:48.139 --> 06:49.773
- Thank you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

06:49.775 --> 06:51.406
Why you didn't tell me
to hang up the damn phone?

06:51.408 --> 06:52.341
I thought you did.

06:52.343 --> 06:53.976
He's sitting there,
sitting there listening.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.278
Ain't nothing wrong
with his ears.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.280
- What'd he say?
- I had the phone on speaker.

06:57.282 --> 06:58.615
You didn't hear?

06:58.617 --> 07:01.184
He said, "Hurry up and get down
here." And he want to smoke.

07:01.186 --> 07:02.485
How long they been married?

07:02.487 --> 07:04.521
They tell me 40-something
years they been married.

07:04.523 --> 07:09.324
Forty years. I can't imagine waking
up, looking at the same ass every day.

07:09.326 --> 07:11.560
You need to trade ass
in every few years.

07:11.562 --> 07:13.829
Wouldn't nobody be married to
you for 40-something seconds.

07:13.831 --> 07:15.331
Do you know what you smell like?

07:15.333 --> 07:18.201
Marriage is a beautiful thing.
I love it.

07:18.203 --> 07:19.802
I love it, I love it.

07:19.804 --> 07:21.870
Oh, she's so damn dramatic.

07:21.872 --> 07:24.206
You know, I think
I'd like to get married.

07:24.208 --> 07:25.942
Hattie, you killed your
last three husbands.

07:25.944 --> 07:27.110
What you wanna
get married for again?

07:27.112 --> 07:29.411
Do you know that bastard
had the audacity

07:29.413 --> 07:31.413
to come talking to me
about some hoes?

07:31.415 --> 07:32.949
Uh. We get it, we get it.

07:32.951 --> 07:33.917
- Right.
- We get it.

07:33.919 --> 07:37.156
What? I ain't do nothing
but give him a little

07:38.023 --> 07:40.223
painless anti-freeze.

07:40.225 --> 07:44.326
Yep, well, she anti-froze him.
Anti-froze all his organs.

07:44.328 --> 07:46.261
I'm so glad I'm single.

07:46.263 --> 07:48.932
Ain't seen old Heathrow
in all this here time.

07:48.934 --> 07:51.466
Can't wait to spend
a little time with him.

07:51.468 --> 07:53.569
You know, I heard his wife died.

07:53.571 --> 07:56.439
Well, she died,
but something else died on the vine, too.

07:56.441 --> 07:59.975
Hold on, now. That man
had the finest set of legs

07:59.977 --> 08:01.845
on this here side of heaven.

08:01.847 --> 08:03.612
Well, he don't
have 'em either, Hattie.

08:03.614 --> 08:05.113
You wait a minute, Bam.

08:05.115 --> 08:07.216
Old age ain't
never stopped nobody

08:07.218 --> 08:09.418
from having no sexiest legs.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.021
Oh, but a doctor will.

08:12.023 --> 08:13.523
That ain't funny.

08:13.525 --> 08:15.624
Joe, that ain't funny, talking
about what the doctor did.

08:15.626 --> 08:17.026
You say what?

08:17.028 --> 08:18.927
Hattie, well, you know he...

08:18.929 --> 08:21.264
Nothing. Nothing. Don't worry about it.
You go on, have your fantasy

08:21.266 --> 08:22.398
- about Heathrow.
- Yeah.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.600
Hey!

08:23.602 --> 08:25.601
- Hey, Brian!
- Hey, Madea!

08:25.603 --> 08:27.502
- Hey, Brian.
- Don't you look nice.

08:27.504 --> 08:28.670
Don't be sitting there,
telling that damn lie.

08:28.672 --> 08:31.507
Look at her, sitting there
looking like a bag of flour.

08:31.509 --> 08:33.076
Don't listen to him.
You look great.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.211
This is my good vintage dress.

08:35.212 --> 08:37.647
You don't even know.
I borrowed this from Aretha Franklin.

08:37.649 --> 08:40.416
And Miss Hattie, Miss Bam,
you two look nice, too.

08:40.418 --> 08:41.985
Thank you, Brian.

08:41.986 --> 08:43.653
Oh. Oh... Dude.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.488
Why you sitting here
lying to these old...

08:45.490 --> 08:50.592
Brian, you always seem to say
the nicest things to me.

08:50.594 --> 08:53.296
I'm not flirting with you,
I'm just saying you look nice. That's it.

08:53.298 --> 08:56.899
This is my fur.
I bought it in 1976.

08:56.901 --> 08:58.934
I wear it
for special occasions.

08:58.936 --> 09:01.437
And I thought this would be
a special occasion.

09:01.439 --> 09:03.306
You mean faux, right?
That's not a real fur?

09:03.308 --> 09:04.474
Four what?

09:04.476 --> 09:05.607
Four dollars.

09:05.609 --> 09:07.376
- Four dollars for what?
- That.

09:07.378 --> 09:09.245
That what he mean.
Four dollars.

09:09.247 --> 09:11.313
Miss Bam,
you wearing real fur?

09:11.315 --> 09:14.549
F-U-R. "Fur."

09:14.551 --> 09:18.354
No, listen to me. You know how many
animals had to die for you to wear that?

09:18.356 --> 09:20.222
But, what the hell?

09:20.224 --> 09:21.924
I didn't kill 'em.

09:21.926 --> 09:23.225
What do I care about that?

09:23.227 --> 09:25.161
That's really,
really horrible.

09:25.163 --> 09:28.163
Soon as I can afford to buy me
a fur, y'all gonna say,

09:28.165 --> 09:30.566
"You can't take that.
You can't wear that."

09:30.568 --> 09:32.100
To hell with what y'all saying.

09:32.102 --> 09:35.605
Well, look like the only part of the
fur you could afford is the collar.

09:35.607 --> 09:38.140
You shouldn't wear fur, okay?
Do you know what people would do?

09:38.142 --> 09:40.076
You'll be walking down the
street, and they'll take paint

09:40.078 --> 09:41.411
and throw it all over your fur.

09:41.413 --> 09:44.413
You let somebody put
some paint on my fur.

09:44.415 --> 09:46.081
Paint my rabbit.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.485
I don't know why that
just turned me on.

09:49.487 --> 09:52.688
But I sure would like to put
some paint on your rabbit.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.059
Oh, my God.

09:54.592 --> 09:56.292
You're sick.

09:56.294 --> 09:57.559
I'll make it hop.

09:57.561 --> 10:00.529
Okay! All right,
we got the car all gassed up, all right?

10:00.531 --> 10:02.331
- So, let's go.
- Hey, boy.

10:02.333 --> 10:03.600
How the hell you
gonna talk about them,

10:03.602 --> 10:05.600
how they look, and not say...
You don't see me sitting here?

10:05.602 --> 10:07.736
How do I look?

10:07.738 --> 10:09.238
You look like
you always look.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.472
Boy, you a hater.

10:10.474 --> 10:12.140
I looks good.

10:12.142 --> 10:14.177
Daddy, I smelled you
before I walked in the house.

10:14.179 --> 10:15.745
No, you didn't smell me.

10:15.747 --> 10:17.549
I'mma tell you what you smell.

10:18.282 --> 10:20.549
That dude right there.

10:20.551 --> 10:25.087
I smell like fresh
berries and springtime

10:25.089 --> 10:28.124
with a little sprinkle of cinnamon
across the middle section.

10:28.126 --> 10:30.592
More like old ass
and roasted nuts.

10:32.597 --> 10:34.998
Okay, all right, all right.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.299
Brian, thank you for driving on over there.
Thank you for driving.

10:37.301 --> 10:39.101
You know I can't drive nowhere.
My license ain't right.

10:39.103 --> 10:41.403
I keep telling you,
I can help you with that.

10:41.405 --> 10:43.472
Yes, but you also told me
I would have to go to court.

10:43.474 --> 10:45.240
Yeah, Madea,
you got tickets

10:45.242 --> 10:47.275
and warrants and license
and everything.

10:47.277 --> 10:50.212
Bench warrants, all the stuff.
Yeah, you have to go to court.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.215
I don't go
to court, okay?

10:52.217 --> 10:53.682
I'm dragged to court.

10:53.684 --> 10:56.485
I don't just go to court 'cause
the judge said to go to court.

10:56.487 --> 10:58.153
I'm a thug, hell.

10:58.155 --> 11:00.188
These new kids don't know
nothing about being no thug.

11:00.190 --> 11:03.558
I'm a real thug.
I'm a O-G M-A-D-E-A.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.129
Your mama try and take me
to court for 42 years, hell.

11:06.131 --> 11:07.562
I was like, "I ain't
going to no court."

11:07.564 --> 11:09.331
No child support.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.767
Changed my address.

11:10.769 --> 11:13.201
I was using your social security number.
That's why she couldn't find me.

11:13.203 --> 11:15.370
Every time they tried to track
and find out where I was,

11:15.372 --> 11:16.374
went right back to your house.

11:16.641 --> 11:17.773
Mmm.

11:17.775 --> 11:20.143
I'm sorry I jacked
up your credit.

11:20.145 --> 11:21.510
Can we go, please?

11:21.512 --> 11:23.278
Look here, young blood,
how long this drive?

11:23.280 --> 11:24.447
About three hours.

11:24.449 --> 11:26.282
I hope there's a bathroom
on the way

11:26.284 --> 11:29.251
'cause I may have to tinkle.
Just a little drop-drop.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.788
Just a drop-drop.
Maybe two.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.057
Just what I thought, kids.
Okay, come on, let's go.

11:34.059 --> 11:35.490
Come on, y'all. Let's go.
Get in the car.

11:35.492 --> 11:37.427
Let's get on up here.
Come on.

11:37.429 --> 11:39.227
Come on.
Come on, y'all, come on.

11:39.229 --> 11:40.495
- Here we come, Mabel.
- Come on, Hattie.

11:40.497 --> 11:41.730
We getting ready to go.
Gotta go on the road.

11:41.732 --> 11:43.533
We'd better go
to the bathroom first.

11:43.535 --> 11:45.467
Aw, look at them.

11:45.469 --> 11:47.169
They are so in love.

11:47.171 --> 11:48.639
Look, they're
still holding hands.

11:49.074 --> 11:50.206
Who?

11:50.208 --> 11:51.407
Mama and Daddy.

11:51.409 --> 11:55.077
What? Wait, they are not
supposed to be here.

11:55.079 --> 11:56.881
- Wait, what? Oh, that's right.
- Oh, my God.

12:00.751 --> 12:01.985
Hi.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.187
- Mama, y'all are not supposed to be here.
- Mmm-mmm.

12:04.189 --> 12:05.554
And neither are you, Daddy.

12:05.556 --> 12:06.788
I told her.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.356
Y'all gotta go.

12:08.358 --> 12:09.658
- Fine.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.094
I can do some work
at the church.

12:11.096 --> 12:12.628
Yeah. And I can do
some shopping.

12:12.630 --> 12:14.363
You forgot you and Mama's
anniversary, didn't you?

12:14.365 --> 12:16.398
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.701
Oh. You better be glad
that mall is still open.

12:19.703 --> 12:21.205
Oh, come on.

12:23.274 --> 12:24.740
And don't come back
till 7:00.

12:24.742 --> 12:26.645
Be glad I didn't put you
on no schedule.

12:31.516 --> 12:33.716
- This is a long-ass way.
- Oh, yeah.

12:33.718 --> 12:35.317
Yes, it is.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.286
Could you please stop saying
"long-ass way"?

12:37.288 --> 12:39.154
Whenever you say
"long-ass way,"

12:39.156 --> 12:41.124
it makes me
have to go again.

12:41.126 --> 12:43.392
I wish to hell you wouldn't
have to stop one more time.

12:43.394 --> 12:44.659
I've been stopping
every five minutes,

12:44.661 --> 12:46.262
talkin' 'bout you have
to go to the bathroom.

12:46.264 --> 12:47.797
We've done
stopped nine times.

12:47.799 --> 12:49.432
Brian, how far we done went?

12:49.434 --> 12:51.500
Nine miles.

12:51.502 --> 12:53.536
You stop to piss at every mile.

12:53.538 --> 12:55.203
Well, you know
I can't help it.

12:55.205 --> 12:58.307
Well, I suspect we better
get you one of these here.

12:58.309 --> 13:00.375
Ugh. What is that?

13:00.377 --> 13:02.245
That girl done pull out
a damn diaper.

13:02.247 --> 13:03.745
And I wouldn't have
to go so much

13:03.747 --> 13:05.681
if Brian wasn't
driving so slow.

13:05.683 --> 13:06.916
Right, speed up here.

13:06.918 --> 13:09.351
I am doing
the speed limit.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.754
It's called obeying the law!

13:11.756 --> 13:14.724
He always drive the speed
limit, old bitch ass.

13:14.726 --> 13:16.458
Oh, I'll get you to speed up.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.230
Hey!

13:19.697 --> 13:21.197
- Hey!
- Joe!

13:21.199 --> 13:22.697
- Damn!
- Madea, don't do that.

13:22.699 --> 13:24.634
Speed up here.

13:24.636 --> 13:26.735
That's the po-po. Hey, throw all the stuff out the window.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.572
Give it to me, Joe.
Hell, I'm legal.

13:30.574 --> 13:33.942
Okay, Betty, hold mine.
It's just one blunt. Or 30.

13:33.944 --> 13:36.312
Please don't tell me you have
marijuana in this car.

13:36.314 --> 13:38.880
I'm legal. That's why
I got a prescription.

13:38.882 --> 13:40.749
Hold on, let me
fix my makeup.

13:40.751 --> 13:42.350
For what?

13:42.352 --> 13:43.952
I'mma flirt with him.

13:43.954 --> 13:46.956
You gonna flirt?
Hell, you finna send all of us to jail.

13:46.958 --> 13:48.291
What the hell is you doing?

13:48.293 --> 13:50.225
- I'm pulling over.
- No!

13:50.227 --> 13:51.826
Pulling over?
What the hell you mean?

13:51.828 --> 13:53.296
You pulling over for what?

13:53.298 --> 13:55.498
- The police?
- Are you insane?

13:55.500 --> 13:57.667
If you see red lights,
that means stop, okay?

13:57.669 --> 13:59.634
If you see green light,
that mean go.

13:59.636 --> 14:03.538
If you see blue lights,
that means you better blow your engine

14:03.540 --> 14:04.807
trying to get the hell
away from 'em.

14:04.809 --> 14:07.210
I am gonna show you
something here, okay?

14:07.212 --> 14:10.312
Your ignorant ass
about to get shot.

14:10.314 --> 14:11.614
Madea, this is
the problem, okay?

14:11.616 --> 14:13.481
This is why so many people
are getting shot.

14:13.483 --> 14:16.318
Because they're not obeying the
law, they're not complying.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.486
Every officer is not
a bad officer,

14:18.488 --> 14:19.654
so we just pulled over.

14:19.656 --> 14:22.725
Okay. All right, I'm gonna
put that on your tombstone.

14:22.727 --> 14:24.894
"All officers are
not bad officers,

14:24.896 --> 14:26.696
"except the one
that shot my ass."

14:26.698 --> 14:28.364
Will you guys
please just stop it?

14:28.366 --> 14:29.999
Oh, we all about to die.

14:30.001 --> 14:31.399
I never thought
I'd die like this.

14:31.401 --> 14:32.934
I thought I'd die
at the strip club.

14:32.936 --> 14:34.903
You wanna stop?
Go, stop. Watch this.

14:34.905 --> 14:35.804
What are you doing?

14:35.806 --> 14:37.974
Do not throw anything
out of this car.

14:37.976 --> 14:39.308
Ain't nobody throwing nothing
out the window.

14:39.310 --> 14:42.311
We putting our hands out the window
'cause we don't wanna get shot.

14:42.313 --> 14:44.413
You know what? This is
absolutely crazy.

14:44.415 --> 14:46.414
I'm sure that's why
all these people got shot.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.250
You know what they were doing?
They weren't complying.

14:48.252 --> 14:49.619
Boy, you damn crazy.

14:49.621 --> 14:50.885
You ain't seen all
the people complying

14:50.887 --> 14:52.654
and the damn officers
still shot 'em?

14:52.656 --> 14:53.590
Man laying down on the street

14:53.592 --> 14:55.591
trying to help a patient,
and they shot him?

14:55.593 --> 14:56.993
All them people ain't crazy.

14:56.995 --> 14:58.727
I'm gonna show you and teach you

14:58.729 --> 15:00.363
that this is how you comply

15:00.365 --> 15:02.597
when an officer
is walking up to the car.

15:02.599 --> 15:03.865
All right, you'll see.

15:03.867 --> 15:05.500
No, you will see.

15:05.502 --> 15:07.602
Somebody get their phone out,
so y'all can record 'em.

15:07.604 --> 15:09.371
Hell, no. I ain't finna
reach for my phone.

15:09.373 --> 15:10.873
He might think that I'm trying

15:10.875 --> 15:12.475
to reach for a gun or something.

15:12.477 --> 15:14.476
Good! You reach for a gun,
they'll shoot your ass,

15:14.478 --> 15:15.878
and put me out of my misery.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.947
You mean put him
out of his misery.

15:17.949 --> 15:19.481
No, I mean put me
out of my misery

15:19.483 --> 15:21.049
'cause if he dead,
I won't be miserable no more.

15:21.051 --> 15:23.519
I'll have a nice little lump
of insurance.

15:23.521 --> 15:25.354
<i>Driver, turn off your engine.</i>

15:25.356 --> 15:27.789
That's new. They never
said that to me before.

15:27.791 --> 15:29.457
Boy, you don't know
nothing about no police.

15:29.459 --> 15:30.993
You don't know nothing
about no police.

15:30.995 --> 15:35.563
<i>Driver, I repeat.
Turn off your engine.</i>

15:35.565 --> 15:36.966
Oh, he getting mad.
He done said it twice.

15:36.968 --> 15:38.467
They don't like
to talk twice, Brian.

15:38.469 --> 15:40.903
Hey, you better leave that bitch
running so we can get up out of here.

15:40.905 --> 15:43.371
Daddy, I want y'all to stop,
okay? Just stop it.

15:43.373 --> 15:45.508
<i>Take your foot off the brake.</i>

15:45.510 --> 15:47.909
Brian, he telling you what to do.
Take your foot off the brake.

15:47.911 --> 15:49.278
Shh!

15:49.280 --> 15:51.780
Now put your foot on the gas,
and let's get the hell up out of here.

15:51.782 --> 15:54.417
Wait a minute. How he know
your foot was on the brake?

15:54.419 --> 15:56.052
Calm down.

15:56.054 --> 15:58.586
When your foot is on the brake, the brake
lights come on, on a car that works.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.056
Oh, the tail light
connected to the brake.

16:00.058 --> 16:02.091
You see that?
That's how they get you.

16:02.093 --> 16:04.693
That's how they
get you, right there.

16:04.695 --> 16:06.762
Brian,
you gonna be a wimp all your life?

16:06.764 --> 16:07.996
Just go for it.

16:07.998 --> 16:10.533
You know why Tupac got shot?
He stopped, at the red light.

16:10.535 --> 16:13.001
You know why Biggie got shot?
He stopped, at a red light.

16:13.003 --> 16:15.538
So you need to go. Drive!

16:15.540 --> 16:17.605
It's so much fun,
your heart skips a beat.

16:17.607 --> 16:19.508
Don't you wanna be
a daredevil once?

16:19.510 --> 16:21.110
Why you gotta be such a square?

16:21.112 --> 16:22.610
Madea, all right.

16:22.612 --> 16:24.113
I'm not running
from the police.

16:24.115 --> 16:25.880
We're not doing
that today.

16:25.882 --> 16:27.515
Oh, really? Really?

16:27.517 --> 16:29.585
I'm gonna show you that
there is nothing wrong

16:29.587 --> 16:31.620
with getting stopped
by the police at all.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.391
Nothing. You'll see.

16:38.096 --> 16:39.765
That ain't funny, Hattie.

16:41.131 --> 16:43.131
Get your hands
in the window.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.167
Oh, Lord.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.505
Hello, officer.
What seems to be the problem?

16:47.804 --> 16:49.705
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

16:49.707 --> 16:51.106
Oh, okay. They're right here.

16:51.108 --> 16:53.109
No, don't move!
Do not move again.

16:53.111 --> 16:55.443
I told you, you had to put your
hands out the window, didn't I?

16:55.445 --> 16:57.046
I was just putting
my hands on the wheel.

16:57.048 --> 16:59.484
Oh, you wanna play this resistance game today.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.249
No, I was...

17:01.251 --> 17:04.386
He's complying. That's what he's
doing, officer. Freely complying.

17:04.387 --> 17:06.555
Who told you to speak, huh?

17:06.557 --> 17:08.960
I'll be the judge and jury
on compliance today.

17:09.792 --> 17:11.028
License and registration.

17:11.963 --> 17:13.127
Don't move!

17:13.130 --> 17:14.632
I just said don't move!

17:16.067 --> 17:18.165
Well, how am I
supposed to get it?

17:18.167 --> 17:19.934
Let me see your hands.

17:19.935 --> 17:21.005
They're right here.

17:22.874 --> 17:24.640
Okay, you're gonna listen to me.

17:24.642 --> 17:28.443
Listen very closely,
so there's no mistakes out here today.

17:28.444 --> 17:31.582
Left index finger.
Left index finger.

17:32.983 --> 17:35.017
Left index finger.
Reach across your body

17:35.019 --> 17:36.419
and open up
the glove compartment

17:36.421 --> 17:38.621
with your left
index finger, sir.

17:38.623 --> 17:40.189
What the hell is he talking
about, "Use your left..."

17:40.191 --> 17:41.927
I'm gonna use my middle
finger in a minute.

17:42.193 --> 17:44.125
Shut up.

17:44.127 --> 17:46.060
I don't know... I don't know
how that's possible.

17:46.062 --> 17:48.463
- Left index finger, sir!
- Uh-huh.

17:48.465 --> 17:50.732
When you touch the glove compartment,
invert that into the peace sign

17:50.734 --> 17:51.933
and grab the documents.

17:51.935 --> 17:53.501
How is that possible?

17:53.503 --> 17:56.439
Don't talk back to me!
Quit doing it!

17:56.441 --> 17:58.173
Damn, I should have
paid your insurance.

17:58.175 --> 17:59.674
Wait, my wallet is...

17:59.676 --> 18:01.076
Don't! Don't!

18:01.078 --> 18:04.180
Hey. Hey, just cooperate.
He on that stuff.

18:04.182 --> 18:05.980
Okay, okay, just stay calm.

18:05.982 --> 18:08.150
I am calm! I'm very calm!

18:08.152 --> 18:09.919
You are not! I am!

18:09.921 --> 18:12.054
If he calm, I don't
wanna see him upset.

18:12.056 --> 18:13.888
You are hostile.

18:13.890 --> 18:16.025
No, sir, I'm not.

18:16.027 --> 18:18.760
Still doing this resistance
thing with me, huh?

18:18.762 --> 18:20.996
No. Can I get it
out of my jacket?

18:20.998 --> 18:22.634
Reach for your jacket.

18:24.569 --> 18:25.934
Don't you be pulling
nothing out of your jacket

18:25.936 --> 18:27.836
unless it's a phone,
so you can record his ass.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.605
You put that camera on 'em,
they start acting different.

18:29.607 --> 18:32.540
They different when they see
you taping them on them phone.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.710
Well, get yours out
and let's go live.

18:34.712 --> 18:36.545
Hell, no. I ain't finna
reach up in there.

18:36.547 --> 18:38.948
Hell, I done had too many
bullet holes and stab wounds.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.816
I done got old, they don't
heal the same no more.

18:40.818 --> 18:41.920
I got diabetes.

18:47.258 --> 18:49.525
You smuggling anything
in here, huh?

18:49.527 --> 18:52.193
Just your license and registration,
what you got in there?

18:52.195 --> 18:54.965
All of you sit right here,
and don't move.

18:57.601 --> 18:59.034
Well, I'm really perturbed.

18:59.036 --> 19:01.569
Ain't that something?
That white boy crazy.

19:01.571 --> 19:03.204
He's
schizophrenic, you know.

19:03.206 --> 19:04.240
I don't like this.

19:04.242 --> 19:06.509
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
What I tell you?

19:06.511 --> 19:07.644
He wasn't supposed to do that.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.112
"He seems so upset. He seems
so outraged here, guys.

19:10.114 --> 19:11.713
"He seems so upset. Wow."

19:11.715 --> 19:13.848
This is really out of line.
This is very wrong.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.917
This is not right.
We didn't do anything.

19:15.919 --> 19:17.553
He didn't even tell us
why he was stopping us.

19:17.555 --> 19:18.953
They don't never tell you, son.

19:18.955 --> 19:20.823
This that racist stuff
that make me

19:20.825 --> 19:22.691
wanna go burn something down.

19:22.693 --> 19:24.259
Make me wanna go protest.

19:24.261 --> 19:25.662
We didn't do anything.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.867
I don't think I like this very much.
This is just wrong of him.

19:29.533 --> 19:31.133
Mr. Simmons.

19:31.135 --> 19:33.102
The reason I pulled
you over back there

19:33.104 --> 19:34.303
is 'cause you swerved

19:34.305 --> 19:36.305
and we can
never be too careful.

19:36.307 --> 19:37.940
God bless you all.

19:37.942 --> 19:39.607
Drive safe out there.

19:39.609 --> 19:40.779
The hell?

19:41.546 --> 19:42.845
Wait a minute. I wanna...

19:42.847 --> 19:44.680
Hold the hell on, boy.
You better let him go.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.548
Don't be trying to stop
him now. It's over, let's go.

19:46.550 --> 19:47.849
We done got away. Let's go.

19:47.851 --> 19:49.684
'Cause if he had
ran me, ha-ha,

19:49.686 --> 19:51.086
we was all going down.
Let's go.

19:51.088 --> 19:52.954
Right. Now drive, hell.

19:52.956 --> 19:56.090
- Why was he so nice all of a sudden?
- I wanna talk to him.

19:56.092 --> 19:58.126
Okay. Okay, great.
You get to the bottom of it.

19:58.128 --> 19:59.961
Can we go now, please?
Can we go?

19:59.963 --> 20:02.131
Wait a minute. They probably
pulled your name up

20:02.133 --> 20:03.632
in that computer back there

20:03.634 --> 20:05.567
and he saw what
you do for a living.

20:05.569 --> 20:07.236
Now he scared,
now he running scared.

20:07.238 --> 20:09.137
Running scared now, ain't you?

20:09.139 --> 20:10.205
This is injustice.

20:10.207 --> 20:12.974
And where there is injustice,
you have to fight.

20:12.976 --> 20:14.242
You go on and get
to the bottom of it,

20:14.244 --> 20:15.778
Martin Luther the King.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.579
Congressman John Lewis, he said,

20:17.581 --> 20:19.315
where there's injustice,
you have to fight.

20:19.317 --> 20:21.683
Get the hell on.
Do what you have to do. Let's go.

20:21.685 --> 20:23.885
Andy Young, and Joseph Lowery,

20:23.887 --> 20:26.221
and everybody would
not allow this.

20:26.223 --> 20:27.890
You've named all them
civil rights leaders.

20:27.892 --> 20:28.990
Do you know what
they have in common?

20:28.992 --> 20:31.594
All of 'em got their ass whipped
trying to make change.

20:31.596 --> 20:33.228
Is that supposed
to be an excuse?

20:33.230 --> 20:34.696
That's not supposed
to be an excuse.

20:35.866 --> 20:37.268
Ooh, they ain't blue.

20:38.299 --> 20:38.968
He said, "Peace."

20:38.970 --> 20:41.002
Well, he just left.
I got his number.

20:41.004 --> 20:43.005
His name is Eddie. I'll get
to the bottom of this.

20:43.007 --> 20:44.073
You ain't never gonna learn.

20:44.075 --> 20:45.607
Who learned a lesson here today?

20:45.609 --> 20:47.308
Did I learn a lesson,
or did you learn a lesson?

20:47.310 --> 20:48.376
Come on, let's go.

20:48.378 --> 20:51.380
Oh, Lord, I really, really
got to go now, y'all.

20:51.382 --> 20:54.083
Bam, if you say you have
to pee one more time,

20:54.085 --> 20:55.884
I'm gonna rip out
your fallopian tubes.

20:55.886 --> 20:57.952
It's just two drops, Brian.

20:57.954 --> 20:59.925
Come on, let's drive.

21:02.827 --> 21:04.259
- Hey, baby.
- <i>Hi.</i>

21:04.261 --> 21:06.362
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm on...</i>

21:06.364 --> 21:08.963
<i>Hey, babe, guess who
I ran into at the airport?</i>

21:08.965 --> 21:11.333
- Who?
- <i>A.J. He was on my flight.</i>

21:11.335 --> 21:12.701
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

21:12.703 --> 21:14.636
Wow. Oh, well,
I'll have to tell Carol.

21:14.638 --> 21:16.038
<i>Yeah, we're going to go
get a car together.</i>

21:16.040 --> 21:17.239
Oh, no, no. Let me
come pick you up.

21:17.241 --> 21:19.344
<i>Babe, you stay. We'll get one.</i>

21:20.110 --> 21:21.277
All right.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.778
All right, well, let me talk
to my brother real quick.

21:22.780 --> 21:23.979
<i>Okay, cool. Hold on.</i>

21:23.981 --> 21:24.880
<i>Yo, what up, bro?</i>

21:24.882 --> 21:27.316
Hey, you take care
of my fiancee, man.

21:27.318 --> 21:28.517
<i>You know I will.</i>

21:28.519 --> 21:31.220
All right. I'll
see you when you get here.

21:31.222 --> 21:32.320
<i>All right, will do.</i>

21:32.322 --> 21:33.756
Yeah, you gotta be here by 6:00.

21:33.758 --> 21:35.057
<i>We will. We will.</i>

21:35.059 --> 21:36.191
- All right.
- <i>All right.</i>

21:36.193 --> 21:38.062
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

21:42.399 --> 21:44.767
Better make sure you
hung up that phone.

21:44.769 --> 21:47.301
I feel really, really
bad about this.

21:47.303 --> 21:49.340
- I don't.
- It's your brother.

21:50.774 --> 21:52.941
Look, I introduced you.

21:52.943 --> 21:54.308
So you know
you didn't want him.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.412
Yeah,
I just need...

21:56.414 --> 21:58.980
You don't need
nothing but me.

21:58.982 --> 22:00.952
- I really love him.
- That's cute.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.353
I mean, what you
gonna do with him?

22:04.355 --> 22:06.387
You know his
broke ass is boring.

22:06.389 --> 22:07.891
You need a man.

22:08.858 --> 22:10.291
Like me.

22:10.293 --> 22:11.693
I'm just...

22:11.695 --> 22:13.828
Look, we don't
have much time.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.396
Hell, look, we took
a flight early

22:15.398 --> 22:16.899
to be here, so we
could hang out.

22:16.901 --> 22:17.965
Yeah.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.203
Now, let's just
enjoy this, aight?

22:20.003 --> 22:22.072
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

22:22.873 --> 22:24.006
- Baby.
- Yeah.

22:24.008 --> 22:25.010
Come over.

22:31.715 --> 22:33.347
All right, room's
almost ready.

22:33.349 --> 22:35.116
Who the hell paying for it?
That's what I wanna know.

22:35.118 --> 22:36.719
I am. I'm paying for it.

22:36.721 --> 22:38.787
Oh, you got it, Mr. Big Spender.
Go ahead.

22:38.789 --> 22:41.355
Oh, you a big spender? When I call
your ass up asking for 20 dollars

22:41.357 --> 22:42.790
so I can get a little joint
or something,

22:42.792 --> 22:44.159
you ain't got no money for me.

22:44.161 --> 22:45.294
I don't know why the
hell we just can't go

22:45.296 --> 22:46.261
over there and stay
at Vianne's house.

22:46.263 --> 22:48.063
Do like all the other
poor black people do

22:48.065 --> 22:49.631
when they go out of town
to visit somebody.

22:49.633 --> 22:52.401
They stay with their cousin, their mama
near 'em, and everybody else is near 'em.

22:52.403 --> 22:55.069
You know what happened last time
we stayed at Vianne's house.

22:55.071 --> 22:57.239
You know why the hell we can't
stay over there. He don't like us.

22:57.241 --> 22:58.507
That's not it at all.

22:58.509 --> 22:59.842
Then what the hell
is it, then, joker?

22:59.844 --> 23:02.478
You don't remember you almost
burned the woman's house down?

23:02.480 --> 23:04.980
I refuse to accept
the consequences,

23:04.982 --> 23:06.481
responsibilitation for that.

23:06.483 --> 23:08.784
- That wasn't my fault.
- Yeah, okay.

23:08.786 --> 23:10.251
Hell, Heathrow was
up in there smoking,

23:10.253 --> 23:11.554
and you know he got
that Jheri curl.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.288
I don't know why the hell
Michael Jackson taught everybody.

23:14.290 --> 23:16.791
If you got a Jheri curl,
don't put no fire near.

23:16.793 --> 23:19.361
That dumb bastard sitting there
smoking, smoking, smoking.

23:19.363 --> 23:21.997
Hair caught on fire.
I said, "Run, nigga, run!"

23:21.999 --> 23:23.531
How the hell you gonna tell
our brother to run?

23:23.533 --> 23:24.900
You know what happened to him.

23:24.902 --> 23:26.868
He was rolling,
and rolling, rolling,

23:26.870 --> 23:27.804
smoke coming out
of the top of his head.

23:27.806 --> 23:29.904
He looked like a damn
chimney on wheels.

23:31.776 --> 23:34.076
You know
I love you, right?

23:34.078 --> 23:36.278
I know. I love you, too.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.813
- Gia, hold on.
- What?

23:37.815 --> 23:39.984
No, come here...

23:40.850 --> 23:42.451
- What?
- You hear that?

23:42.453 --> 23:43.722
What?

23:44.521 --> 23:46.288
Bad! Bad, Daddy.

23:46.290 --> 23:48.423
That?

23:48.425 --> 23:50.124
Yeah, right next door.
You hear that?

23:50.126 --> 23:51.425
They're doing it.

23:51.427 --> 23:52.528
Anthony! Anthony!

23:52.530 --> 23:54.163
Gia, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

23:54.165 --> 23:55.998
What? I don't
wanna hear that.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.833
- I know, but I heard that...
- Who your daddy?

23:57.835 --> 23:59.000
I know that voice.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.501
You know the voice?

24:00.503 --> 24:03.070
- Anthony!
- What? Who...

24:03.072 --> 24:04.309
That's my daddy.

24:05.442 --> 24:08.343
This here
a nice hotel, yeah.

24:08.345 --> 24:10.913
It do remind me of the one
I used to pimp out of.

24:10.915 --> 24:13.015
I had these hoes
running in and out, right?

24:13.017 --> 24:14.282
And I had this one,

24:14.284 --> 24:16.818
they used to call her
a contagious.

24:16.820 --> 24:18.053
Don't ask why.

24:18.055 --> 24:20.189
But anyway, she was running in and out

24:20.191 --> 24:21.323
and I was like, "Look here,

24:21.325 --> 24:23.224
"you better bring me
this money, hoe,

24:23.226 --> 24:26.028
"'cause you got to go home
and feed this boy. He hungry."

24:26.030 --> 24:28.163
Daddy, please, okay? Stop it.

24:28.165 --> 24:29.998
Sorry, I didn't mean
to talk about your mama.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.266
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much. Okay.

24:31.268 --> 24:32.401
Sure.

24:32.403 --> 24:33.568
All right, come on. Let's go
get ready for the party.

24:33.570 --> 24:36.939
Yeah, hurry up. I need to get
my drink on and my smoke on.

24:36.941 --> 24:38.840
Okay. Come on.

24:38.842 --> 24:41.009
- Your daddy?
- Yeah, that's my daddy.

24:41.011 --> 24:42.577
- What're you doing?
- I'mma go wait for him

24:42.579 --> 24:44.078
- to come out.
- What?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.315
- What're you sayin'? Why?
- What do you mean, "Why"?

24:46.317 --> 24:47.583
He ain't supposed to be
in there with her.

24:47.585 --> 24:49.151
You ain't supposed
to be here with me!

24:49.153 --> 24:50.051
That's some bull,

24:50.053 --> 24:51.053
because you know
you always get up with me.

24:51.055 --> 24:52.988
A.J., are you really
about to go over there?

24:52.990 --> 24:54.056
Yeah.

24:54.058 --> 24:55.289
If you go over there,
I'm leaving.

24:55.291 --> 24:57.425
- Well, go. I don't care, go.
- Go?

24:57.427 --> 24:59.530
- Go. There's the door. Go.
- A.J.

25:09.138 --> 25:10.338
Renee?

25:10.340 --> 25:11.606
A.J.?

25:11.608 --> 25:14.442
- What the hell is going on?
- Oh, my God.

25:14.444 --> 25:16.310
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

25:16.312 --> 25:19.513
Call the ambulance, A.J.!

25:19.515 --> 25:21.215
Oh, there's A.J.
Hey, man.

25:21.217 --> 25:22.351
- How you doing?
- Oh, my...

25:22.353 --> 25:23.618
What're you doing here?

25:23.620 --> 25:25.556
- Okay.
- What's going on?

25:27.390 --> 25:28.923
- What it...
- Wait.

25:30.159 --> 25:31.359
What the hell?

25:31.361 --> 25:33.261
- Look at her. Hey.
- What in the...

25:33.263 --> 25:34.630
- Oh, shit.
- Wow!

25:34.632 --> 25:37.633
Mabel, what
happened to him?

25:37.635 --> 25:39.534
That rope
got too tight.

25:39.536 --> 25:42.237
You know, that happened to me
one time, but I lived.

25:42.239 --> 25:44.940
Will you shut up, Hattie? I wish to
hell it would've choked you. Shut up!

25:44.942 --> 25:47.041
I believe that's Anthony.

25:47.043 --> 25:48.609
That sure look like his
face, but I can't...

25:48.611 --> 25:50.511
I ain't never seen
the other part of him.

25:50.513 --> 25:52.614
Talk about pitching a tent.

25:52.616 --> 25:53.682
What is this?

25:53.684 --> 25:55.182
Oh, that
there right there

25:55.184 --> 25:57.318
that go right across
his body so...

25:57.320 --> 25:59.421
- Hush your mouth!
- What?

25:59.423 --> 26:01.522
Hattie, stop tellin' everybody

26:01.524 --> 26:03.491
in the whole damn world
that you into this.

26:03.493 --> 26:04.692
Shut up!

26:04.694 --> 26:08.262
Hattie, we don't need no tutorial
on S and M's, okay? Hush!

26:08.264 --> 26:10.332
That's that
boy's daddy.

26:10.334 --> 26:13.567
So what? Hell,
he gotta learn at some point!

26:13.569 --> 26:16.704
Wait, he's not breathing.
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

26:16.706 --> 26:17.908
What is it?

26:20.444 --> 26:22.210
I don't know about that.

26:22.212 --> 26:24.946
Look like one part of him
is breathing pretty good...

26:24.948 --> 26:26.213
Getting plenty of oxygen.

26:26.215 --> 26:28.115
Joe, I want you
to shut the hell up.

26:28.117 --> 26:30.018
You'd be laying there
just like he is.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.353
Instead of trying
to catch your breath.

26:31.355 --> 26:33.020
That's it!
Rep your set, fool!

26:33.022 --> 26:34.522
Rep your set, fool!

26:34.524 --> 26:37.124
Rep your set!

26:37.126 --> 26:40.598
Hey, man, hey!
Hey, rep your set. South side!

26:43.133 --> 26:44.566
That girl fine
as hell over there.

26:44.568 --> 26:45.733
Shut up, fool!

26:45.735 --> 26:48.069
He needs mouth-to-mouth!

26:48.071 --> 26:50.172
Well, get to it.
Make sure you bend over when you do it.

26:50.174 --> 26:52.173
- I don't think I can!
- Joe!

26:52.175 --> 26:54.076
You ask me to blow no air
in that nigga lung.

26:54.078 --> 26:55.310
Y'all better get a plunger.

26:55.312 --> 26:58.212
- Oh, get the hell outta the way! I'll do it!
- Mmm-hmm.

26:58.214 --> 27:00.281
- Hattie!
- Hattie!

27:00.283 --> 27:02.616
Hattie, that ain't
his damn face!

27:02.618 --> 27:05.053
- Hattie! Hattie!
- What?

27:05.055 --> 27:07.422
Hattie, that's not his mouth!

27:07.424 --> 27:09.257
I told y'all she
ain't got no tonsils.

27:09.259 --> 27:10.992
Get your ass up and
come on back over here!

27:10.994 --> 27:12.329
- What?
- Hattie!

27:15.264 --> 27:17.132
You a pro.

27:17.134 --> 27:18.303
Damn!

27:19.470 --> 27:21.603
Is that a ball
in his mouth?

27:21.605 --> 27:26.240
Yeah, I had one,
and it got stuck right there.

27:26.242 --> 27:28.009
What
happened to him?

27:28.011 --> 27:30.244
I don't know!
He just stopped breathing.

27:30.246 --> 27:33.448
Maybe there's something wrong
with his heart, his chest.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.584
No, baby.
It wasn't his heart or his chest.

27:35.586 --> 27:38.053
I believe it was your
heart and your chest

27:38.055 --> 27:40.788
that stopped his heart
in his chest from beating.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.324
What?

27:42.326 --> 27:43.557
Joe, would you
shut your mouth?

27:43.559 --> 27:45.227
I know you into the older
persuasion.

27:45.229 --> 27:47.362
I can tell 'cause
you with his old ass...

27:48.432 --> 27:50.535
...but you think that's something?

27:51.335 --> 27:52.768
Renee, call the ambulance!

27:52.770 --> 27:54.038
Oh...

28:08.751 --> 28:10.085
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

28:10.087 --> 28:11.752
What's... What's
going on? You late.

28:11.754 --> 28:12.820
Yeah.

28:12.822 --> 28:15.524
Okay, so what happened?
Flight delayed or something?

28:15.526 --> 28:17.192
No, no, no, traffic.

28:17.194 --> 28:18.626
Where is A.J.?

28:18.628 --> 28:20.295
I don't know.

28:20.297 --> 28:21.732
I thought you two were
taking a car together.

28:22.598 --> 28:23.832
No, we didn't.

28:23.834 --> 28:25.333
But you said you would.

28:25.335 --> 28:27.071
Well, I lost him.

28:27.805 --> 28:30.071
He's not answering
his phone.

28:30.073 --> 28:31.472
Have you seen him?

28:31.474 --> 28:34.076
Yeah, we got separated
at the airport.

28:34.078 --> 28:35.179
Oh, okay.

28:36.180 --> 28:37.479
I'm gonna
call him again.

28:37.481 --> 28:38.482
Okay.

28:41.585 --> 28:42.683
Hey.

28:42.685 --> 28:44.054
Hey.

28:44.454 --> 28:45.519
You okay?

28:45.521 --> 28:46.624
Yeah.

28:47.523 --> 28:48.722
What's wrong?

28:48.724 --> 28:50.357
Uh, is your mama here?

28:50.359 --> 28:51.492
No, not yet.

28:51.494 --> 28:53.095
I've been calling her
and Daddy.

28:53.097 --> 28:54.261
They were supposed
to be here at 7:00.

28:54.263 --> 28:55.329
I don't know where
they could be.

28:55.331 --> 28:56.431
Did you get them?

28:56.433 --> 28:58.266
No, and A.J.
knows better.

28:58.268 --> 28:59.366
Beep-beep!

28:59.368 --> 29:00.434
Uncle Heathrow!

29:00.436 --> 29:01.603
Excuse me.

29:03.607 --> 29:06.274
Beep-beep!

29:06.276 --> 29:08.876
Oh, no. No, no, no.
What is this?

29:08.878 --> 29:11.145
This is the cake
I wanna give.

29:11.147 --> 29:12.213
You're not giving
this cake...

29:12.215 --> 29:14.249
Take your damn hands
off the cake

29:14.251 --> 29:16.718
before I knock you down
and run over you.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.919
Okay, wait. How about this?

29:17.921 --> 29:20.122
How about I take the cake
and go put it in the kitchen?

29:20.124 --> 29:22.289
No, I want it here
on this table.

29:22.291 --> 29:25.326
You are not putting that cake
on the table! No, sir.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.362
Leave her alone!

29:26.364 --> 29:29.297
Leave her alone! Don't touch
the woman on the cat.

29:29.299 --> 29:31.432
- Give me!
- Leave the woman on the cat.

29:31.434 --> 29:33.335
- Give me!
- Leave the woman on the cat.

29:33.337 --> 29:34.736
I got it.

29:34.738 --> 29:36.203
Thank you.

29:36.205 --> 29:37.372
Come on now,
Uncle Heathrow.

29:37.374 --> 29:39.641
Touch this and see if you
don't get kicked in the nut.

29:39.643 --> 29:41.476
You don't have legs.

29:41.478 --> 29:43.444
Oh, I forgot about that.

29:43.446 --> 29:46.147
But I got a cane,
and I got a fist.

29:46.149 --> 29:49.219
I want it on the table.
With the kitty on the cat.

29:49.853 --> 29:51.318
Put the kitty on the cat!

29:51.320 --> 29:52.586
Where is everybody?

29:52.588 --> 29:55.292
No one's answering their phone
and all these people are here.

29:56.193 --> 29:57.392
Is my mama here?

29:57.394 --> 29:58.460
You're late!

29:58.462 --> 30:00.162
Yeah. Where is she?

30:00.164 --> 30:01.796
This is why
we always fighting.

30:01.798 --> 30:04.598
- Is my mama here?
- No, she's not.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.666
Damn, man!

30:05.668 --> 30:07.338
Why do you
look like that?

30:08.405 --> 30:11.239
Why the hell are you
so late, A.J.?

30:11.241 --> 30:12.473
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

30:12.475 --> 30:14.542
You are never on time.

30:14.544 --> 30:16.877
Carol, wait.
Something's wrong.

30:16.879 --> 30:17.778
What's wrong?

30:17.780 --> 30:20.615
No, wait.
All these people are here

30:20.617 --> 30:22.951
for your mother and your
father's anniversary

30:22.953 --> 30:24.888
and you can't even
be on time.

30:25.856 --> 30:28.190
You are so irresponsible.

30:28.192 --> 30:30.595
Look, I need to talk
to my mama.

30:31.228 --> 30:32.594
That's it.

30:32.596 --> 30:33.894
What's wrong?

30:33.896 --> 30:35.329
I don't know.

30:35.331 --> 30:36.633
A.J., what is it?

30:38.668 --> 30:40.835
- Oh. Surprise!
- Surprise!

30:40.837 --> 30:42.002
Mama! You okay?

30:42.004 --> 30:44.673
I'm sorry. Your daddy never
picked me up at the church

30:44.675 --> 30:46.407
and he's not answering
his phone.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.843
I don't know where he is.
Is he here?

30:48.845 --> 30:51.582
That's not like Daddy at all.
Let me go try and call him.

30:52.749 --> 30:54.583
He's in...
He's in the hospital.

30:54.585 --> 30:56.888
What? What
happened to him?

30:57.654 --> 30:59.221
He had
a heart attack.

30:59.223 --> 31:00.689
- What?
- Oh, my God!

31:00.691 --> 31:02.691
Why the hell didn't he say
that when he walked in?

31:02.693 --> 31:03.758
Where is he?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.292
St. Andrews.

31:05.294 --> 31:07.295
He's stable, but he's
in intensive care.

31:07.297 --> 31:09.330
We might not be able to see
him till tomorrow morning.

31:09.332 --> 31:10.499
Mama,
go with us. Come on.

31:10.501 --> 31:13.602
Don't worry. I'm coming.
Hold on, hold the car for me.

31:13.604 --> 31:16.704
Get the van, the special one.
I'm coming.

31:16.706 --> 31:17.742
Oh.

31:18.242 --> 31:19.309
Hold on.

31:23.012 --> 31:26.314
Damn! Damn!

31:26.316 --> 31:29.252
I dropped the damn kitty cake.

31:32.289 --> 31:34.525
They ain't have
to do me like that.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.701
I don't like
being in no hospital.

31:46.703 --> 31:47.935
Come in for one thing,

31:47.937 --> 31:49.503
and then something else
goes wrong.

31:49.505 --> 31:51.605
I went up in there
because I had a headache.

31:51.607 --> 31:53.741
You know, when I came out, they
were trying to cut my foot off.

31:53.743 --> 31:54.843
I said, "Hell, no,

31:54.845 --> 31:56.711
"y'all ain't finna cut my foot
off for a headache!"

31:56.713 --> 31:58.846
Joe, shut up.
Just shut the hell up.

31:58.848 --> 32:00.714
I wonder what they doing
to him back there.

32:00.716 --> 32:04.051
Well, they probably trying to
take that ball out of his mouth.

32:04.053 --> 32:05.420
- What?
- Well, they're gonna need

32:05.422 --> 32:06.788
to get some lube
on it or something,

32:06.790 --> 32:08.722
'cause it was
down there pretty deep.

32:08.724 --> 32:12.326
Mabel, how a woman get a ball
that deep down a man's throat?

32:12.328 --> 32:15.462
Joe, say one thing, Joe,
and I'mma slap your ass pissy!

32:15.464 --> 32:18.299
Somebody slappin' you pissy,
that don't sound good at all.

32:18.301 --> 32:19.667
And on you,
it ain't gonna be good,

32:19.669 --> 32:20.835
'cause you know piss sting

32:20.837 --> 32:22.971
when you have it
on too long. It stings.

32:22.973 --> 32:24.838
Here, pissy, pissy, pissy.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.075
Bam, "Little Pissy,"
that what we call her.

32:27.077 --> 32:29.076
That was her stage name
back in the day.

32:29.078 --> 32:30.444
"Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

32:30.446 --> 32:32.846
"to the stage, Little Pissy."

32:32.848 --> 32:34.883
Hey, nigga, how long we gotta
be up in this hospital?

32:34.885 --> 32:37.384
We can't leave until
we find out he's okay, okay?

32:37.386 --> 32:39.386
I'm sure Vianne and the family
are on their way down here.

32:39.388 --> 32:41.323
What the hell we waiting
to see if he okay for?

32:41.325 --> 32:42.423
I don't give a damn.

32:42.425 --> 32:45.059
I don't give a damn
if he okay. I don't like him.

32:45.061 --> 32:48.896
You know, a heart attack
sure can put a damper

32:48.898 --> 32:50.932
on an anniversary party.

32:50.934 --> 32:52.366
You think?

32:52.368 --> 32:54.935
Yeah, sure can,
'specially if you dead.

32:54.937 --> 32:56.770
That's right.
Death can do that to you.

32:56.772 --> 32:59.340
Death will take you
out of here.

32:59.342 --> 33:02.076
That's right.
Death make you dead.

33:02.078 --> 33:03.711
You think that's something,
honey?

33:03.713 --> 33:05.413
I sure in hell hope
she don't find out

33:05.415 --> 33:07.048
how he died and what he was
doing, I sure do.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.583
Well, she ain't
gotta do anythin',

33:08.585 --> 33:10.085
we can go
and tell her that now.

33:10.087 --> 33:11.752
Hattie, you ain't
finna say nothing.

33:11.754 --> 33:12.753
Well, why not?

33:12.755 --> 33:13.689
That ain't none of your
business, what that man

33:13.691 --> 33:15.589
was doing in that hotel
with that girl!

33:15.591 --> 33:17.659
- Well, ain't that your family?
- Yes.

33:17.661 --> 33:19.894
Then that make it
our business, then.

33:19.896 --> 33:21.730
My family, not yours.

33:21.732 --> 33:23.731
Mabel, who you think
you talkin' to?

33:23.733 --> 33:25.499
What is you talkin' about
over there, Auntie M.?

33:25.501 --> 33:28.369
You know you can't wait
to tell her what happened

33:28.371 --> 33:30.704
and what you saw in that hotel.

33:30.706 --> 33:33.942
Nobody's saying anything,
Miss Bam. Nobody.

33:33.944 --> 33:35.876
I ain't finna tell her nothing!
Let me tell you something.

33:35.878 --> 33:38.046
Folk get mad at you when you tell
'em something about their husband.

33:38.048 --> 33:39.646
I'm not gonna
tell Vianne nothin'.

33:39.648 --> 33:41.415
I'mma sit here
with my mouth shut.

33:41.417 --> 33:43.550
Good, 'cause let me
tell you something...

33:43.552 --> 33:45.586
Hold on... Hold on
a minute. Hold on a minute.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.154
Where was you hoes
back in the day

33:47.156 --> 33:49.022
when I needed somebody
to hold my secrets

33:49.024 --> 33:52.160
when I was running all them
hoes and had all that weed

33:52.162 --> 33:53.961
and dope and everything,
and the heroin?

33:53.963 --> 33:55.730
What happened to the bro code?

33:55.732 --> 33:58.866
Why you keep saying that?
We are not men, Joe.

33:58.868 --> 34:00.734
You know,
in the animal kingdom,

34:00.736 --> 34:03.707
some species,
they have both sexes.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.574
Keep it up, I'm gonna
raise this dress up

34:06.576 --> 34:08.175
and show you how much
of a dude I am.

34:08.177 --> 34:10.844
You know what? I just can't
wait for you to be maggot food.

34:10.847 --> 34:12.545
I just want maggots
all over you,

34:12.547 --> 34:13.746
just eating you alive.

34:13.748 --> 34:15.815
- Dang, Ma!
- What?

34:15.818 --> 34:18.719
That's what I want him to be,
some damn maggot food.

34:18.722 --> 34:20.757
There she is. Come on, Vianne.

34:22.426 --> 34:25.058
Hey, Vianne.
How you doing, baby?

34:25.060 --> 34:26.761
Any word?

34:26.763 --> 34:27.928
Not nothing yet.

34:27.929 --> 34:29.663
- Hey, A.J.
- Hey.

34:29.665 --> 34:31.130
- How you doing?
- Fine.

34:31.132 --> 34:33.065
Baby, you got on
too much damn cologne.

34:33.068 --> 34:34.435
That's funky.

34:34.437 --> 34:37.772
And it's too sweet, Mabel.
I can smell it all the way over here.

34:37.774 --> 34:40.774
Yes, it's too strong.
Don't wear that no more.

34:40.775 --> 34:42.009
I don't have on cologne.

34:42.011 --> 34:44.212
The hell you preach?

34:44.214 --> 34:47.514
Go with her, player.
She might be trying to save your life.

34:47.516 --> 34:49.882
Will you stop it?
It's a sad occasion.

34:49.885 --> 34:53.620
It's sad for you. I don't like your
daddy, so it ain't sad for me.

34:53.621 --> 34:54.755
I'm just trying to help you out.

34:54.757 --> 34:57.091
Whatever. What is going on,
and where's the doctor?

34:57.092 --> 34:58.792
- Calm down.
- No, that's my daddy.

34:58.794 --> 34:59.894
I know that.

34:59.896 --> 35:01.662
And he's been like
a father to me.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.964
He been like a father
to a lot of women.

35:03.966 --> 35:05.566
Will y'all get the
doctor, please?

35:05.568 --> 35:07.201
Come on, A.J.

35:07.203 --> 35:09.069
The nurse said
she'll be right back.

35:09.071 --> 35:10.638
Oh, okay.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.207
She look good
in that green dress.

35:12.209 --> 35:14.142
Oh, yeah. You all right,
Vianne, baby?

35:14.144 --> 35:15.843
Yes, I just wanna
know what happened.

35:15.845 --> 35:17.779
Well, see, what
here happened was,

35:17.781 --> 35:21.049
he got this here ball
stuck in his throat...

35:21.051 --> 35:24.685
Hey! Hey! Hallelujah!

35:24.687 --> 35:27.020
Hattie,
you better shut your damn mouth.

35:27.022 --> 35:29.426
And it was lodged
back there, in the...

35:30.160 --> 35:32.794
- Hush.
- Damn, Ma!

35:32.796 --> 35:34.261
I'm sorry.

35:34.263 --> 35:37.665
You ain't had to hit me like that.
Keep your damn hands to yourself!

35:37.667 --> 35:39.533
Hattie. Shh.

35:39.535 --> 35:40.901
Don't be shushing me!

35:40.903 --> 35:43.104
Will y'all stop it, please?
You are worse than fourth graders!

35:43.106 --> 35:45.006
This is a serious situation.
Stop it.

35:45.008 --> 35:46.540
I don't know who the hell
you think you're talkin' to.

35:46.542 --> 35:48.075
I ain't no damn...
Your mama a fourth grader!

35:48.077 --> 35:50.044
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

35:50.046 --> 35:51.245
From what we understand,

35:51.247 --> 35:52.314
he had a heart attack.
That's all we know.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.915
Yeah, I know that. A.J.
said that back at the house.

35:54.917 --> 35:56.283
- Yeah.
- But is he all right?

35:56.285 --> 35:59.654
I was with him, he was fine.
I just left him.

35:59.656 --> 36:02.957
Yeah, baby, that's 'cause
you left him in a restful state.

36:02.959 --> 36:05.292
Sometimes, when people
have a heart attack,

36:05.294 --> 36:08.662
they doin' somethin' strenuous.

36:08.664 --> 36:09.796
Daddy.

36:09.798 --> 36:11.899
- What was he doing?
- He was fu...

36:11.901 --> 36:13.167
Hey!

36:15.138 --> 36:16.870
You lucky you didn't
swallow them bastards,

36:16.872 --> 36:18.605
have them go in and
chewing up your esophagus

36:18.607 --> 36:19.807
going down to your stomach.

36:19.809 --> 36:22.075
I paid a lot of
money for these damn teeth.

36:22.077 --> 36:23.947
Keep it up, I'mma give you
a asstric bypass.

36:25.981 --> 36:27.247
I wanna tell you this.

36:27.249 --> 36:29.783
Brian really did
try to help him

36:29.785 --> 36:33.122
when he gave him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

36:33.622 --> 36:34.888
Thank you.

36:34.890 --> 36:36.323
I'm tellin' ya,
I saw my nephew

36:36.325 --> 36:37.491
kissing on that man,
on his lips,

36:37.493 --> 36:40.627
I said, "Lord, have mercy,
blow him air in his lungs."

36:40.629 --> 36:42.964
He went in farther
than any man

36:42.966 --> 36:45.098
should ever go with another man.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.634
Unless you're into
that kinda thing.

36:47.636 --> 36:48.870
Where was he?

36:48.872 --> 36:50.671
At the ho...

36:50.673 --> 36:51.839
Shut up!

36:51.841 --> 36:54.274
Damn it, Ma!
I'm gonna fuck you up!

36:54.276 --> 36:55.343
Shut up!

36:55.345 --> 36:56.678
Well, where was he?

36:56.680 --> 36:58.645
He was...

36:58.647 --> 37:00.247
Well, he was
at a...

37:02.785 --> 37:04.618
You got one more time to hit me.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.988
I promise, you got one more time
to hit me. I'm gonna pull...

37:06.990 --> 37:10.058
Joe. Hattie.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.660
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:12.662 --> 37:16.033
Are we all still acting
like we wasn't at the hotel?

37:16.600 --> 37:17.865
Ma?

37:17.867 --> 37:20.000
- Wait. What hotel?
- A-ha!

37:20.002 --> 37:21.868
Now you askin'
the right question.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.937
Bam. Bam, hush.

37:23.939 --> 37:25.372
Oh, there's the doctor.

37:25.374 --> 37:26.975
Listen. Hey, doc.

37:26.977 --> 37:28.810
Can you please come back
in a little while?

37:28.812 --> 37:30.211
They're asking us questions

37:30.213 --> 37:32.747
and we wanna answer them
before you start talking.

37:32.749 --> 37:34.781
Keep going now.
Next question, please.

37:34.783 --> 37:37.317
No. I wanna know what's going
on with my father-in-law.

37:37.319 --> 37:38.321
What is going on?

37:39.222 --> 37:41.055
You were so close.

37:41.057 --> 37:42.624
Ooh, shut your mouth!

37:42.626 --> 37:45.660
Sitting over there looking
like Raj and Dee's mama.

37:45.662 --> 37:47.794
- Are you the Thompson family?
- Yes.

37:47.796 --> 37:49.830
- Is he all right?
- And you are?

37:49.832 --> 37:50.968
His wife.

37:51.868 --> 37:53.901
I'm sorry,
he didn't make it.

37:53.903 --> 37:55.203
- What?
- I'm sorry.

37:56.305 --> 37:57.840
- No.
- I'm sorry.

37:58.642 --> 38:00.375
No. No.

38:00.377 --> 38:04.078
Did she just walk off like that?
What kind of hospital is this?

38:04.080 --> 38:06.817
Y'all have insurance or
somethin', the way she just left?

38:08.051 --> 38:09.216
- Bam.
- Mabel.

38:09.218 --> 38:10.218
Why the hell
are you crying?

38:10.220 --> 38:13.723
I just cry when I see
everybody else crying.

38:14.356 --> 38:17.424
Oh, Lord! He dead.

38:17.426 --> 38:19.694
- Joe.
- Yeah?

38:19.696 --> 38:20.995
You sad, too?

38:20.997 --> 38:23.067
Yeah, I'm real sad.

38:25.334 --> 38:26.968
He owed me
some money.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.136
Will you
shut the hell up?

38:28.138 --> 38:30.171
Can't you see this
is a sad occasion?

38:30.173 --> 38:31.205
Look at these people crying.

38:31.207 --> 38:32.973
And you sitting there
saying something stupid

38:32.975 --> 38:34.241
like that ignorant ass.

38:34.243 --> 38:37.044
Look here, Nate Dogg.
If I'm not in his will,

38:37.046 --> 38:41.084
I'm telling you right now,
that funeral's finna be messed up.

38:44.821 --> 38:47.354
Can you smoke weed
in a hospital?

38:47.356 --> 38:48.925
I'm gonna hit you next.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.225
You all right,
Uncle Heathrow?

38:52.227 --> 38:53.428
I know y'all were close.

38:53.430 --> 38:55.162
Yes, we were close.

38:55.164 --> 38:57.265
Did y'all get
his personal things?

38:57.267 --> 38:58.966
Nah, not yet.

38:58.968 --> 39:00.370
You get his driver's license?

39:01.037 --> 39:02.035
Why?

39:02.037 --> 39:04.805
Well, I wanna know if
he's a organ donor.

39:04.807 --> 39:06.406
No, I need a kidney.

39:06.408 --> 39:09.776
I'm sure he had good organs
left in that body somewhere,

39:09.778 --> 39:11.979
except for his heart.
Don't really want that.

39:11.981 --> 39:12.979
Will you stop it?

39:12.981 --> 39:14.482
Miss Vianne's getting ready
to come in here.

39:14.484 --> 39:15.850
Hey, maybe you can have

39:15.852 --> 39:17.484
the bottom of his legs.

39:17.486 --> 39:18.486
Or his liver.

39:18.488 --> 39:20.721
Or maybe you can get a lung,
just cover up the...

39:25.828 --> 39:27.495
Hey, Vianne, how are you?

39:27.497 --> 39:29.930
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.299
Mom,
are you all right?

39:31.301 --> 39:32.433
I'm okay.

39:32.435 --> 39:34.334
Try not to get that Jheri
curl juice on your hand

39:34.336 --> 39:35.772
that's on my shoulder.

39:37.207 --> 39:38.975
Sorry about your sheets.

39:39.843 --> 39:41.843
And your couch.

39:41.845 --> 39:43.877
And your husband.

39:43.879 --> 39:45.846
Mama, we'll go with you.

39:45.848 --> 39:48.216
No. I just
need some time.

39:48.218 --> 39:49.183
Okay.

39:49.185 --> 39:52.419
Hang on in there.
The Bible said, Two Timothy,

39:52.421 --> 39:55.423
that the wages of the employed

39:55.425 --> 39:57.457
shall be unemployed
when they go to work.

39:57.459 --> 39:58.828
Amen.

40:00.296 --> 40:02.466
You know what they say
about lonely women, don't you?

40:04.300 --> 40:05.803
They give it up.

40:06.269 --> 40:07.468
You okay, baby?

40:07.470 --> 40:10.171
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was just a little...

40:10.173 --> 40:12.105
Yeah.

40:12.107 --> 40:13.207
Oh, you talking
to her.

40:13.209 --> 40:14.308
Don't be whispering up
in this ear,

40:14.310 --> 40:16.076
talking about,
"You okay, baby?"

40:16.078 --> 40:18.513
I'll be gettin' ready to give you some.

40:18.515 --> 40:20.417
I'm so sorry
about your daddy.

40:22.084 --> 40:23.316
Thank you, honey.

40:23.318 --> 40:24.821
You okay, A.J.?

40:26.522 --> 40:28.555
That's a stupid question.

40:28.557 --> 40:30.059
He just call her dumb?

40:31.995 --> 40:35.129
I was just trying to
see if you were okay.

40:35.131 --> 40:36.399
Wasn't trying to...

40:38.501 --> 40:40.200
My daddy died.

40:40.202 --> 40:41.370
What you think?

40:42.504 --> 40:43.970
I'm sorry.

40:43.972 --> 40:45.540
Why the hell you being
so mean to that girl?

40:45.542 --> 40:47.008
I don't know why
you're being so mean to her.

40:47.010 --> 40:48.075
I'm gonna shut my mouth,

40:48.077 --> 40:50.178
'cause I been punchin'
him in his damn face.

40:50.180 --> 40:51.511
Y'all better tell his
ignorant ass something

40:51.513 --> 40:52.814
'cause I don't like that.

40:52.816 --> 40:55.383
A.J., now is not
the time, okay?

40:55.385 --> 40:56.584
Thank you.

40:56.586 --> 40:59.486
Now, y'all know we gotta be

40:59.488 --> 41:02.490

41:12.135 --> 41:13.433
In the morning.
That's right.

41:13.435 --> 41:15.403
Hell, yeah, we ain't
finna be here tonight.

41:15.405 --> 41:17.971
I'm tired. I gotta

41:17.973 --> 41:20.006
Player have to rest.

41:20.008 --> 41:21.043
- Brian?
- Yeah?

41:22.444 --> 41:23.981
Thanks for trying.

41:26.216 --> 41:28.919
I wish I could've
did more. Sorry.

41:29.252 --> 41:30.484
It's okay.

41:30.486 --> 41:32.453
And, baby,
let me tell you something. He tried.

41:32.455 --> 41:35.122
Brian looked down
at Daddy. He was a hero.

41:35.124 --> 41:37.625
He just went and tried
to help that man

41:37.627 --> 41:40.093
with all that stuff strapped
to him. I mean...

41:40.095 --> 41:41.629
Nothing.
It was just, you know...

41:41.631 --> 41:45.131
He was just... It was...
It was terrible.

41:45.133 --> 41:46.633
He was at a hotel?

41:46.635 --> 41:49.035
- Uh...
- Baby, I'm exhausted.

41:49.037 --> 41:51.138
I'm more tired
than Harriet Tubman

41:51.140 --> 41:52.973
and Rosa Parks,
all put together.

41:52.975 --> 41:54.241
Yeah, I believe
that's about right.

41:54.243 --> 41:55.542
We need to go. Uh...

41:55.544 --> 41:57.345
Come on, guys.
It's getting late.

41:57.347 --> 41:59.247
Wait, why was he
at a hotel?

42:01.050 --> 42:04.084
Um... She wants to know
why he was at the hotel.

42:04.086 --> 42:06.319
Well, these hoes
don't tell. Okay.

42:06.321 --> 42:08.488
Okay, wait, what
the hell is going on?

42:08.490 --> 42:11.058
Nothing, just let them go.
I know you're tired.

42:11.060 --> 42:12.426
Yeah, they exhausted.

42:12.428 --> 42:14.028
Yeah. All of a sudden,
I got real tired.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.997
Where's my purse?
Oh, it's on my lap.

42:15.999 --> 42:17.430
Yeah, we're all tired, uh...

42:17.432 --> 42:19.566
- Where we going?
- Come on. Come on.

42:19.568 --> 42:21.301
Here we come.

42:21.303 --> 42:23.370
- We ain't never been...
- Come on. Come on, Hattie.

42:23.372 --> 42:24.571
- Hurry up!
- Good Lord!

42:24.573 --> 42:26.374
Come on,
let's go. Go on.

42:26.376 --> 42:28.209
If you ain't there
in 30 seconds, I'm leaving.

42:28.211 --> 42:29.446
I'll see y'all later on.

42:31.680 --> 42:34.048
What are they
not telling us?

42:34.050 --> 42:36.484
I'm sorry, y'all.
I gotta go.

42:36.486 --> 42:38.986
I gotta go pick up
my son. I'm sorry.

42:38.988 --> 42:40.187
Oh, thank you. Um...

42:40.189 --> 42:42.490
You should go upstairs
and talk to Mama.

42:42.492 --> 42:43.924
I'm sure she's still up.

42:43.926 --> 42:45.392
She don't have to do that.

42:45.394 --> 42:47.060
Nah, you don't
have to do that.

42:47.062 --> 42:48.129
What?

42:48.131 --> 42:49.266
Nah. Just let her rest.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.000
Come on.
I'll walk you to your car.

42:54.002 --> 42:55.972
You know this neighborhood's
rough, right?

42:57.140 --> 42:58.638
No, it's not.

42:58.640 --> 42:59.943
Nah, I'll walk with her.

43:20.330 --> 43:22.395
Let me tell your
hoe-witch ass something.

43:22.397 --> 43:23.564
Don't you talk
to me like that.

43:23.566 --> 43:24.999
Don't bring your damn ass

43:25.001 --> 43:26.232
to this house no more.
You hear me?

43:26.234 --> 43:27.301
Get your damn hands
off of me!

43:27.303 --> 43:28.636
Look, I will
tell my mother.

43:28.638 --> 43:30.504
And I will
tell your brother!

43:30.506 --> 43:33.274
About you and his wife.

43:33.276 --> 43:35.245
What, you think
I didn't see that?

43:38.981 --> 43:40.117
You don't know me.

43:40.984 --> 43:43.084
You better get in that house

43:43.086 --> 43:45.019
and get with that girl

43:45.021 --> 43:47.321
so you can keep her
daddy's money coming in

43:47.323 --> 43:49.689
and leave me
the hell alone.

43:49.691 --> 43:52.526
I am not the one.

43:52.528 --> 43:55.261
Yeah, okay. I know
you heard me, though.

43:55.263 --> 43:58.031
And I know your ass
better heard me, too.

43:58.033 --> 43:59.068
Now move.

44:14.617 --> 44:17.187
Yo. What's that about?

44:18.287 --> 44:19.723
Nothing, man.
Come on.

44:22.258 --> 44:23.557
Hey, um...

44:23.559 --> 44:25.194
I'm glad
you're here, man.

44:25.627 --> 44:27.127
Come on, man.

44:27.129 --> 44:30.564
We just...
We just lost our daddy, man.

44:30.566 --> 44:34.104
I don't know. You were more
of a father to me than he was.

44:36.272 --> 44:38.272
Man, he was
a great dad, man.

44:38.274 --> 44:41.107
But he was always gone.

44:41.109 --> 44:43.046
Always. Ever since
I was born.

44:44.213 --> 44:45.314
But you,

44:46.381 --> 44:47.617
you were there.

44:48.718 --> 44:50.183
I'm glad you're here now.

44:50.185 --> 44:51.519
Come on, man,
let's just go in the house.

44:51.521 --> 44:55.124
There's one more thing, actually,
I wanted to ask you, um...

44:56.591 --> 44:58.694
I was going to ask you
after the party,

45:00.430 --> 45:02.332
but I want you
to be my best man.

45:03.066 --> 45:04.198
Best man?

45:04.200 --> 45:07.269
Yeah. I asked Gia to marry
me, and she said yeah.

45:08.336 --> 45:09.739
You like her, right?

45:10.439 --> 45:11.738
Yeah. Yeah.

45:11.740 --> 45:13.374
Good.

45:13.376 --> 45:14.542
I know Carol don't.

45:14.544 --> 45:17.243
Man, she don't
like nobody.

45:17.245 --> 45:18.682
So, um...

45:19.414 --> 45:20.750
What you think?

45:21.551 --> 45:23.086
Can you do that for me?

45:24.486 --> 45:25.618
Yeah.

45:25.620 --> 45:27.488
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

45:27.490 --> 45:29.557
All right.

45:29.559 --> 45:31.528
- Love you, man.
- I love you, too, man.

45:36.432 --> 45:38.502
I can't believe he's gone.

45:40.202 --> 45:45.105
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, baby. It's okay.

45:45.107 --> 45:47.741
And it's just Mama now.

45:47.743 --> 45:50.377
I don't know what she's
gonna do without him.

45:50.379 --> 45:53.247
She loved him so much.

45:53.249 --> 45:54.381
Yeah. I...

45:54.383 --> 45:56.118
And all those years.

45:58.620 --> 46:00.421
I'm sure she's devastated.

46:00.423 --> 46:02.158
Yeah, I'm sure she is.

46:05.894 --> 46:10.163
You know,
your brother seems strange.

46:10.165 --> 46:14.567
Yeah, well,
Jessie and my dad never got close.

46:14.569 --> 46:17.537
But, um, Anthony and A.J.,
they are the same.

46:17.539 --> 46:19.141
Just alike.

46:23.245 --> 46:25.448
Why'd you have to go
out to talk to her?

46:27.249 --> 46:28.350
I just did.

46:28.917 --> 46:30.283
But why?

46:30.285 --> 46:31.384
Carol!

46:31.386 --> 46:33.287
I just asked you
a question.

46:33.289 --> 46:34.658
Well, my daddy
just died, okay?

46:35.925 --> 46:37.825
Can you just
give me a break?

46:37.827 --> 46:41.828
Just back off,
all right? Back off!

46:41.830 --> 46:44.430
You know, I'm really getting tired
of you talking to me like this.

46:44.432 --> 46:47.303
Well, good, because I'm getting
tired of talking to you.

46:47.803 --> 46:48.805
Okay.

46:49.504 --> 46:50.640
Okay.

46:52.841 --> 46:54.410
I see how
it's gonna be.

47:02.385 --> 47:03.584
Look...

47:03.586 --> 47:05.321
Can you just give me
a moment to breathe?

47:06.689 --> 47:07.921
I'm sorry.

47:07.923 --> 47:09.525
Yeah, fine.

47:10.725 --> 47:11.861
Where you going?

47:13.196 --> 47:14.831
To take that moment.

47:23.506 --> 47:25.573
- Everything all right, bro?
- Yeah.

47:25.575 --> 47:27.508
Sure? You wanna
talk about it?

47:27.510 --> 47:30.211
Nah, man. I'm just gonna go
outside and get some air.

47:30.213 --> 47:32.212
All right, let me throw a shirt on.
I'll come with you.

47:32.214 --> 47:34.718
No, no need.
You just stay with her.

47:35.718 --> 47:36.720
All right.

47:50.232 --> 47:51.899
Man, baby.

47:51.901 --> 47:53.203
What's up?

47:55.238 --> 47:57.470
My brother ain't
taking this too well.

47:57.472 --> 47:58.841
Yeah, I know.

48:00.343 --> 48:02.442
What about you?
How you feeling?

48:02.444 --> 48:05.281
I'm fine. Just sad.

48:05.814 --> 48:07.216
Yeah, I know.

48:08.618 --> 48:09.753
I know, baby.

48:11.386 --> 48:13.553
You don't seem too upset.

48:13.555 --> 48:15.357
I mean, I'm sad.
It's just...

48:16.926 --> 48:19.292
I'm good.

48:19.294 --> 48:21.564
I just can't believe
I lost my daddy.

48:22.664 --> 48:25.401
Yeah. I'm here.

48:26.401 --> 48:27.537
I know, baby.

48:30.640 --> 48:31.942
I know.

48:35.544 --> 48:37.745
I'm so glad
I got you.

48:37.747 --> 48:39.783
I'm so glad
I got you, too.

49:12.347 --> 49:13.782
I'm right here for you.

49:30.832 --> 49:31.834
Hi.

49:33.068 --> 49:34.667
Hi.

49:34.669 --> 49:35.736
You're up early.

49:35.738 --> 49:37.837
Yeah. Couldn't sleep.

49:37.839 --> 49:40.973
Yeah, I didn't do
much better myself.

49:40.975 --> 49:42.042
Hi.

49:42.044 --> 49:43.676
Hi.

49:43.678 --> 49:46.446
I started breakfast.

49:46.448 --> 49:49.982
- I knew your mama wouldn't be up to it.
- I know. Thank you.

49:49.984 --> 49:52.886
Smells good in here.

49:52.888 --> 49:54.488
What the hell
you doing in here?

49:54.490 --> 49:55.555
A.J.!

49:55.557 --> 49:56.790
No, you need to get
your ass out of here.

49:56.792 --> 49:58.024
What is
wrong with you?

49:58.026 --> 49:59.493
You don't know
who she is, do you?

49:59.495 --> 50:01.861
She's Mama and Daddy's friend.

50:01.863 --> 50:03.430
She ain't no damn friend.

50:03.432 --> 50:05.866
No? Well, then
tell me who I am, A.J.

50:05.868 --> 50:07.433
Tell me!

50:07.435 --> 50:09.903
- You better get...
- Okay, what the hell is going on?

50:09.905 --> 50:11.772
A.J.! A.J.! Baby.

50:11.774 --> 50:14.408
No. Don't follow me, Carol.

50:14.410 --> 50:16.410
I don't think you ought
to follow him.

50:19.013 --> 50:19.946
I'm sorry.

50:19.948 --> 50:22.116
I guess I could say
good morning to you.

50:22.118 --> 50:24.450
- Hi, good morning.
- How y'all doing?

50:24.452 --> 50:25.953
- Good.
- Good.

50:25.955 --> 50:29.122
Hell, y'all got a hell of a morning
going on up in here, don't you?

50:29.124 --> 50:30.991
- What was all that about?
- Mmm-hmm.

50:30.993 --> 50:32.058
Nothing.

50:32.060 --> 50:33.593
Yes, it was gotta be
something, honey.

50:33.595 --> 50:35.763
- Right.
- What did he do?

50:35.765 --> 50:37.131
What did you do?

50:37.133 --> 50:39.165
Bam, hush, hush, hush.

50:39.167 --> 50:40.933
- How're y'all doing?
- We're good, baby.

50:40.935 --> 50:42.803
We came over here
to be with y'all

50:42.805 --> 50:44.571
'cause I know that
y'all just going through,

50:44.573 --> 50:46.038
'cause your daddy is dead.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.508
Yeah. I know.

50:47.510 --> 50:49.008
And I know it's hard for you,

50:49.010 --> 50:50.611
'cause y'all don't
even know what to do,

50:50.613 --> 50:52.412
'cause he's so dead,
but I hope

50:52.414 --> 50:54.480
y'all all right 'cause
grief is something.

50:54.482 --> 50:55.816
Somebody just
here one day,

50:55.818 --> 50:57.984
and then just drop
damn dead the next.

50:57.986 --> 51:00.453
Don't even know, people die
that ain't never died before.

51:00.455 --> 51:01.821
- I know.
- And it's just horrible.

51:01.823 --> 51:03.022
Yeah.

51:03.024 --> 51:05.091
Heart ain't beating, no blood
running warm in his vein,

51:05.093 --> 51:06.192
no nothing.

51:06.194 --> 51:08.962
But we here to encourage
you, and lift you up

51:08.964 --> 51:12.433
and pray with y'all
and let the Lord be...

51:12.435 --> 51:13.433
Have his way.

51:13.435 --> 51:15.868
That's the one.
Have his way with the dead man.

51:15.870 --> 51:17.703
Yeah. And I appreciate that.

51:17.705 --> 51:19.038
And I'm just here for y'all.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.707
I want y'all to know that
I came to courage you.

51:20.709 --> 51:22.109
That's what I'm here for.
To courage you.

51:22.111 --> 51:23.709
- You understand?
- Yes.

51:23.711 --> 51:25.479
- I'm bringing you courage.
- We appreciate that.

51:25.481 --> 51:28.182
- All the way from my house.
- Thank you. Thank you. Yes.

51:28.184 --> 51:30.683
- Sorry he dead, though.
- Uh, um, um...

51:30.685 --> 51:32.852
- Listen, Madea.
- Hmm?

51:32.854 --> 51:34.821
My mother asked
about you this morning.

51:34.823 --> 51:36.124
- Do she?
- Mmm-hmm.

51:36.126 --> 51:37.924
I ain't got no money to
help bury nobody. I'm sorry.

51:37.926 --> 51:39.826
No. She just wants
to talk to you.

51:39.828 --> 51:42.196
Okay, 'cause your dad is dead.
Where she at now?

51:42.198 --> 51:43.997
She's up in her room.

51:43.999 --> 51:45.732
In the upper room?

51:45.734 --> 51:47.767
She upstairs
in the upper room?

51:47.769 --> 51:49.169
Lord, she dead, too?

51:49.171 --> 51:50.937
- Oh, Jesus!
- Hattie, Hattie!

51:50.939 --> 51:52.138
I don't even know
why I be bothered

51:52.140 --> 51:53.174
with you, Hattie.
Listen to me.

51:53.176 --> 51:56.042
The woman is upstairs.
She's not in the upper room.

51:56.044 --> 51:58.011
Okay? She upstairs.

51:58.013 --> 51:59.178
- Oh.
- Lord, have mercy.

51:59.180 --> 52:00.480
I thought she said upstairs

52:00.482 --> 52:01.747
- in the upper room.
- No. No.

52:01.749 --> 52:03.216
- Come on, Bam, let's go.
- Okay.

52:03.218 --> 52:04.951
I'm going, too.

52:04.953 --> 52:06.953
I said, "Come on, Bam."

52:06.955 --> 52:08.955
I thought you said, "Come
on, ma'am." I'm coming.

52:08.957 --> 52:11.225
I thought you wanted to be
down here with Heathrow?

52:11.227 --> 52:13.060
Right. You like him so much,

52:13.062 --> 52:14.627
you could be
down here with Heathrow.

52:14.629 --> 52:15.895
- Come on.
- No!

52:15.897 --> 52:18.098
- Fine! Come on. Fine! Come on.
- I changed my mind!

52:18.100 --> 52:20.533
Mabel, stairs
is difficult for me.

52:20.535 --> 52:23.002
That's 'cause your ass is
getting difficult to go up 'em.

52:23.004 --> 52:24.238
Shh!

52:24.240 --> 52:26.910
Hush! Hush!
She's sad, she's sad.

52:28.077 --> 52:29.142
Hey.

52:29.144 --> 52:30.676
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:30.678 --> 52:31.947
Hey. How're you?

52:32.548 --> 52:33.980
I'm not good.

52:33.982 --> 52:35.716
That's because
he's dead, huh?

52:35.718 --> 52:37.950
- Bam!
- What, Mabel? He is dead.

52:37.952 --> 52:39.520
Hush your mouth.
Shut the hell up.

52:39.522 --> 52:42.055
I'm just trying to help her.
Minister to her.

52:42.057 --> 52:43.857
That ain't no ministry, hush.

52:43.859 --> 52:45.691
You ain't got no power.
You ain't anointed.

52:45.693 --> 52:48.529
- You're insensitive.
- Yes, it's insensitive.

52:48.531 --> 52:51.698
- Will you shut the hell up?
- Mabel, I'm just trying to help her.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.136
She knows she's sad already.

52:54.135 --> 52:55.701
How're you doing, baby?

52:55.703 --> 52:57.506
I'm okay.

52:58.006 --> 53:00.107
Well, you looks bad.

53:00.109 --> 53:02.676
I mean, you don't
look good at all!

53:02.678 --> 53:03.743
Hattie.

53:03.745 --> 53:06.078
- You look awful!
- Hattie. Hattie!

53:06.080 --> 53:07.848
Don't be saying
that to the woman.

53:07.850 --> 53:09.283
- She can hear you.
- I don't know

53:09.285 --> 53:11.151
why the hell I asked y'all
to come up here with me.

53:11.153 --> 53:12.285
You should've
stayed downstairs.

53:12.287 --> 53:13.822
Where's she going?
What, what?

53:14.756 --> 53:15.821
Madea.

53:15.823 --> 53:16.890
Yeah, honey.

53:16.892 --> 53:18.627
Here's a suit that
he liked to wear.

53:19.995 --> 53:22.796
I don't wear no man's suit.
What do I look like to you?

53:22.798 --> 53:24.698
You trying to give me
his old clothes?

53:24.700 --> 53:26.836
I want you to take it
to the funeral home.

53:28.037 --> 53:29.669
- Oh.
- Do you mind?

53:29.671 --> 53:31.971
Oh. Uh...

53:31.973 --> 53:33.906
Okay, I guess I can take
it to the funeral home.

53:33.908 --> 53:35.776
And I want you
to view the body.

53:35.778 --> 53:36.879
Wait.

53:39.113 --> 53:40.814
You want me
to view the body?

53:40.816 --> 53:44.183
Yes, and I don't
want the kids doing it.

53:44.185 --> 53:46.886
Okay, well, I guess I could
take it on down there

53:46.888 --> 53:48.055
and view the body.

53:48.057 --> 53:49.855
Just make sure
he looks normal.

53:49.857 --> 53:52.828
You remember what he looked like
last time you saw him, don't you?

53:57.932 --> 53:59.600
Yeah.

53:59.602 --> 54:02.703
Yeah. Yeah.

54:02.705 --> 54:04.738
Yeah, we all remember
what he look like last...

54:04.740 --> 54:05.939
Right, he had that...

54:05.941 --> 54:09.276
We all do, honey,
he had a ball lodged...

54:09.278 --> 54:12.613
Bam! Damn, Bam.
Damn, Bam, Sam.

54:12.615 --> 54:13.616
- Mabel.
- Hush.

54:14.783 --> 54:16.149
I'm trying to help her.

54:16.151 --> 54:17.216
Thank you, Madea.

54:17.218 --> 54:20.053
The kids are gonna be
devastated.

54:20.055 --> 54:22.022
So we're having
the funeral right away.

54:22.024 --> 54:24.691
Yeah, they're gonna be tore up.
Them kids gonna be...

54:24.693 --> 54:27.696
- Wait, what you mean, "right away"?
- In two days.

54:29.064 --> 54:30.796
- Two days for the...
- Two days?

54:30.798 --> 54:33.200
- You gonna bury the man in two days?
- Why not?

54:33.202 --> 54:34.435
Honey, listen to me.

54:34.437 --> 54:37.303
Black people do not bury nobody
in two days. That's illegal.

54:37.305 --> 54:41.107
It take us at least 12, 15,
35, 40 days for us to bury.

54:41.109 --> 54:43.276
We gotta wait for everybody to come
from all over the country to get there.

54:43.278 --> 54:44.711
- That's right.
- Get out of jail,

54:44.713 --> 54:47.180
get permission from the parole board.
Hell, what you talking about?

54:47.182 --> 54:48.785
That's how we're doing it.

54:50.185 --> 54:54.187
I mean, she's shoveling him
up under the dirt quick.

54:54.189 --> 54:57.093
Uh, baby, do you wonder
what happened?

54:58.727 --> 55:00.394
- Hattie.
- What, Ma?

55:00.396 --> 55:02.895
I's just wondering if she's
wondering what happened.

55:02.897 --> 55:03.964
Get the hell out of here.

55:03.966 --> 55:05.198
Just get on up out of here
with your foolishness.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.299
- Yes, get on out!
- Get out of here!

55:06.301 --> 55:08.167
- Get out! Out! Out!
- But...

55:08.169 --> 55:10.203
Get on out of here.
That girl wasn't wondering nothing.

55:10.205 --> 55:11.638
You hush.

55:11.640 --> 55:15.107
Wait. What you telling me to hush for?
I'm trying to tell you something.

55:15.109 --> 55:16.442
We not wondering what
was wrong with him.

55:16.444 --> 55:17.877
I'm talking to you,
too, Bam.

55:17.879 --> 55:19.779
- Because he had a ball...
- Out! Out!

55:19.781 --> 55:21.113
- Out!
- Get on up out of here!

55:21.115 --> 55:22.348
Bam! Out!
You know what?

55:22.350 --> 55:23.816
Get your ass up
out of here, too.

55:23.818 --> 55:25.218
- Get out!
- What'd I do?

55:25.220 --> 55:26.752
Get the hell out of here.
Both of y'all, just go.

55:26.754 --> 55:27.720
Wait a minute, Mabel,

55:27.722 --> 55:29.423
you think I'm finna go back
down them steps...

55:29.425 --> 55:31.091
- Bam, come on, out! Out, out!
- Come on!

55:31.093 --> 55:32.825
Mabel, don't touch me
with that dead man's suit!

55:32.827 --> 55:33.727
Out, out!

55:33.729 --> 55:35.828
No, you come on,
you don't make that...

55:38.300 --> 55:39.700
Thank you, Madea.

55:39.702 --> 55:41.368
- Yeah, baby, I'm...
- I really appreciate you.

55:41.370 --> 55:43.870
I'm so sorry that
they're just so...

55:43.872 --> 55:46.038
Just ignorant.
Ignorant-ass people.

55:46.040 --> 55:47.941
They don't have class
like me or you.

55:47.943 --> 55:49.308
You wanna come downstairs
and eat something?

55:49.310 --> 55:50.944
You don't need to be sitting
up here by yourself.

55:50.946 --> 55:53.379
No, I think I need
a while to myself.

55:53.381 --> 55:56.116
Really? Oh, that's right,
you wanna grieve.

55:56.118 --> 55:58.417
You wanna be up here
and crying and sad.

55:58.419 --> 56:01.854
Yeah, that's usually how people
do it. They just wanna die.

56:01.856 --> 56:03.189
They just wanna die

56:03.191 --> 56:06.359
after somebody that they
loved done went on to glory.

56:06.361 --> 56:09.361
- And hopefully, he went to glory.
- Hmm.

56:09.363 --> 56:11.363
Anyway, um,
I know it's hard

56:11.365 --> 56:13.066
being married all them
years, now he gone.

56:13.068 --> 56:15.000
You know, usually,
when the man dies,

56:15.002 --> 56:16.236
the woman die,
after all them years,

56:16.238 --> 56:17.970
the man or woman
die right behind.

56:17.972 --> 56:19.305
They don't stay
separated too long.

56:19.307 --> 56:20.807
You might not
have too long

56:20.809 --> 56:22.776
'cause y'all were
together so many years.

56:22.778 --> 56:25.145
But it's all right,
I'm glad I could make you feel better.

56:25.147 --> 56:29.015
- Mmm-hmm.
- Amen. This is ministry. Praise him. Hallelujah.

56:29.017 --> 56:31.118
I know this is a sad
occasion, but I'm here

56:31.120 --> 56:33.086
and I want you to
understand something.

56:33.088 --> 56:35.187
No matter what
is going on in your life,

56:35.189 --> 56:38.991
you can always count on
the Lord or somebody.

56:38.993 --> 56:41.328
The Bible say,
"Weeping..."

56:41.330 --> 56:45.298
No. Sweeping. "Sweeping in
the middle of the night

56:45.300 --> 56:47.933
"will bring the dust in
the morning." I don't know,

56:47.935 --> 56:50.303
- something like that, babe. I'm trying to comfort you, you know.
- Something.

56:50.305 --> 56:51.370
- I got you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

56:51.372 --> 56:53.240
Yes, I want you to be...

56:53.242 --> 56:55.542
"Yea,
though she walked in the valley

56:55.544 --> 56:58.310
"with the shadow
of Little Red Riding Hood

56:58.312 --> 56:59.546
"and the three bears,

56:59.548 --> 57:01.013
"she feared no evil,

57:01.015 --> 57:03.216
"'cause the three little pigs
was not around."

57:03.218 --> 57:04.551
- Amen.
- Amen.

57:04.553 --> 57:06.819
- You gonna be all right. Okay?
- Yes.

57:06.821 --> 57:08.254
Now you just
go on and cry.

57:08.256 --> 57:10.055
Don't you let nobody
tell you not to cry.

57:10.057 --> 57:13.493
You cry, you scream,
you wail, you fall out.

57:13.495 --> 57:16.062
You just do what all black
people do when somebody die.

57:16.064 --> 57:18.031
- You just get ugly cry.
- I'll see.

57:18.033 --> 57:19.299
- Okay.
- I'll see if I can.

57:19.301 --> 57:20.901
You gonna
see him again?

57:20.903 --> 57:22.002
No, I'll see if I can cry.

57:22.004 --> 57:23.435
- You'll see if you can. Okay.
- Yes.

57:23.437 --> 57:24.837
Yeah, but if you
gonna see him again,

57:24.839 --> 57:26.272
I hope you
don't see him with

57:26.274 --> 57:28.174
- the last time we saw him.
- No, I know.

57:28.176 --> 57:29.441
- Mmm-mmm.
- Mmm-mmm.

57:29.443 --> 57:31.877
I'm sorry.

57:31.879 --> 57:34.316
Every time I think about him
dying, I just...

57:48.497 --> 57:50.129
What are you doing here?

57:50.131 --> 57:51.531
So you just
gonna ignore me?

57:51.533 --> 57:52.535
You need to go.

57:53.301 --> 57:54.901
I wanted you all night.

57:54.903 --> 57:56.403
Stop. Your wife is here.

57:56.405 --> 57:57.970
I don't care about her.

57:57.972 --> 57:59.908
You know what?
I'm not...

58:01.910 --> 58:04.076
- A.J., I can't do this.
- Tell me no.

58:04.078 --> 58:05.912
I cannot do this!

58:05.914 --> 58:08.480
Go! Okay? Go, now!

58:08.482 --> 58:09.785
Get out!

58:15.089 --> 58:16.091
Hey!

58:17.993 --> 58:19.258
Is Jessie in there?

58:19.260 --> 58:20.926
No, no.

58:20.928 --> 58:22.863
Then what you
doing in there?

58:22.865 --> 58:23.930
I was talking to Gia.

58:23.932 --> 58:26.066
- Why?
- What do you want?

58:26.068 --> 58:28.104
Mama wants to have the funeral
the day after tomorrow.

58:28.636 --> 58:29.736
What?

58:29.738 --> 58:31.504
Yeah, so I was just going
around telling everyone.

58:31.506 --> 58:33.109
Why is she rushing
to bury him?

58:33.941 --> 58:35.642
- Is that rushing?
- Yeah.

58:35.644 --> 58:37.644
Look, A.J., I don't know. Okay?

58:37.646 --> 58:39.912
Come here.

58:39.914 --> 58:42.015
Why you talking
to Renee like that?

58:42.017 --> 58:43.352
Don't worry about it.

58:47.890 --> 58:48.891
Hmm.

58:50.225 --> 58:52.959
Well, she asked me to do
what I can to help y'all,

58:52.961 --> 58:54.160
so I'mma do what I can.

58:54.162 --> 58:55.395
That ain't no good idea.

58:55.397 --> 58:57.497
That funeral's finna be
messed up!

58:59.434 --> 59:01.533
I knows about funerals.
I done buried a lot of men.

59:01.535 --> 59:03.169
A lot of them.

59:03.171 --> 59:05.238
Now, I don't know nothing
about no boujee funerals.

59:05.240 --> 59:07.374
All I know is about
black folk funeral,

59:07.376 --> 59:09.609
the way they used to do Negro
spirituals back in the day.

59:09.611 --> 59:11.611
Everybody'd sing a hymn,
and then they departed.

59:11.613 --> 59:14.580
I hope y'all can appreciate
what I'mma try to do.

59:14.582 --> 59:16.917
And if you need anything,
just let us know.

59:16.919 --> 59:18.118
Money. She gonna
need some money.

59:18.120 --> 59:19.285
She always
need some money.

59:19.287 --> 59:20.953
'Cause none of this
is free.

59:20.955 --> 59:22.988
Now, I'll need a coordinating
fee for the funeral

59:22.990 --> 59:26.058
and the coordinator usually gets
75% of what the casket costs.

59:26.060 --> 59:27.961
- We'll work it out.
- Okay, great. Thank you.

59:27.963 --> 59:30.397
Could you let us know why
she's burying him so fast?

59:30.399 --> 59:31.497
Um...

59:31.499 --> 59:33.600
I believe I know why she's
trying to bury him so quick.

59:33.602 --> 59:34.935
She can't stand his ass.

59:34.937 --> 59:37.102
Child, I don't know.
I've been wondering the same damn thing.

59:37.104 --> 59:38.604
Black people don't
bury nobody this quick.

59:38.606 --> 59:40.339
If a woman
don't like the man,

59:40.341 --> 59:41.975
she can't wait to get
him in the ground.

59:41.977 --> 59:43.410
Either that, his insurance.

59:43.412 --> 59:46.046
But I guess you gotta ask her,
'cause I don't know.

59:46.048 --> 59:47.714
Okay, I will.

59:47.716 --> 59:50.116
- Yo, can I smoke weed up in here?
- No. No way. Mmm-mmm.

59:50.118 --> 59:51.484
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, boujee.

59:51.486 --> 59:52.685
Can't smoke
no weed up in this...

59:52.687 --> 59:53.953
Joe!

59:53.955 --> 59:55.488
Baby, can I talk
to you for a second?

59:55.490 --> 59:58.325
Hey, you wanna talk to me,
I'll go talk to you.

59:58.327 --> 01:00:00.560
I think
it's a private situation

01:00:00.562 --> 01:00:02.395
because she
whispered it to you.

01:00:02.397 --> 01:00:03.495
Did you ever
think about that?

01:00:03.497 --> 01:00:04.730
Bam, will you
hush your mouth?

01:00:04.732 --> 01:00:06.366
- That's them people talking.
- She said,

01:00:06.368 --> 01:00:07.767
"Can I talk to you
for a second?"

01:00:07.769 --> 01:00:10.569
He said, "Well, what do you wanna
"talk to me about?" She said...

01:00:10.571 --> 01:00:11.638
Bam, hush!

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.138
- She just froze.
- Hush!

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.473
Bam, that's why
I don't mess with you.

01:00:14.475 --> 01:00:16.642
You just don't know how
to keep your mouth closed

01:00:16.644 --> 01:00:17.944
at the right time.

01:00:17.946 --> 01:00:20.479
If it's private, why would you
say it in front of the public

01:00:20.481 --> 01:00:22.281
- in front of everybody?
- He the one won't go.

01:00:22.283 --> 01:00:24.616
Yeah, that kid won't get up.
Get on up!

01:00:24.618 --> 01:00:26.055
Baby, please.

01:00:28.423 --> 01:00:30.122
"Baby, baby,
baby, please."

01:00:30.124 --> 01:00:31.091
Mmm-hmm.
She gotta say "please."

01:00:31.093 --> 01:00:32.424
Boy, go on up there
and see what that girl...

01:00:32.426 --> 01:00:33.595
Get on in there.

01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:37.363
I tell you what.
She wouldn't have to beg me.

01:00:37.365 --> 01:00:40.066
Hell, with an ass like that,
I'd be running after her.

01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:42.468
- He got on too much perfume.
- Way too much of it.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.604
- Much too much perfume to have on.
- Perfume.

01:00:46.008 --> 01:00:47.374
Joe!

01:00:47.376 --> 01:00:50.109
That girl fine, too, there.
That's nice, too.

01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:51.947
I don't know.

01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:54.116
Bam.

01:00:56.218 --> 01:00:58.087
Mabel.

01:00:59.086 --> 01:01:00.453
- Mmm-hmm!
- Hey.

01:01:00.455 --> 01:01:02.022
She...

01:01:02.024 --> 01:01:05.361
Heathrow. I believe the old
hoes has figured it out.

01:01:07.361 --> 01:01:09.095
- Yeah.
- Ain't that the same?

01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:10.796
That's the same
damn perfume, Mabel.

01:01:10.798 --> 01:01:12.631
You know exactly
what that mean.

01:01:12.633 --> 01:01:13.667
Wait, ain't it...

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:15.701
That means shut your mouth!
That's what that mean.

01:01:15.703 --> 01:01:18.437
Mabel. Ain't he married
to the one that went up...

01:01:18.439 --> 01:01:19.772
Hush! And engaged
to the brother...

01:01:19.774 --> 01:01:21.374
You know what?
I'm not finna deal with this.

01:01:21.376 --> 01:01:23.810
I'm not finna deal with
this at all. Oh, hell, no!

01:01:23.812 --> 01:01:26.245
It took y'all long enough.
Hell, that's just...

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:28.381
See, I'm a player
from back in the day.

01:01:28.383 --> 01:01:30.316
I figured it out.

01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:34.154
I know what's happening
right when it's happening.

01:01:34.156 --> 01:01:36.256
Heathrow.

01:01:36.258 --> 01:01:37.460
What the hell
y'all talking about?

01:01:39.593 --> 01:01:41.227
You smell that, too?

01:01:41.229 --> 01:01:42.761
I'm surprised
you can smell anything

01:01:42.763 --> 01:01:44.798
with your damn throat with
the hole at the bottom of it.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.399
I still got a nose.

01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:48.734
I told you years ago,
stop all that damn smoking.

01:01:48.736 --> 01:01:51.071
But you wanna smoke
52 packs a day.

01:01:51.073 --> 01:01:53.205
Now look at you. You got a hole
in the bottom of your throat.

01:01:53.207 --> 01:01:54.307
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:57.310
I just wanna know why
his hoe smell like his bro.

01:01:57.312 --> 01:01:58.611
Heathrow,

01:01:58.613 --> 01:02:00.747
don't you say
nothing to them!

01:02:00.749 --> 01:02:01.848
Right. Right.

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:03.750
This one smelling
like that one.

01:02:03.752 --> 01:02:05.554
That one smelling
like this one.

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:07.754
But in a minute,

01:02:07.756 --> 01:02:10.522
all these hoes here
gonna be smelling like Joe.

01:02:10.524 --> 01:02:12.091
Now, listen.
Vianne asked me

01:02:12.093 --> 01:02:13.359
to come over here
and help with this funeral

01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:14.294
and that's just
what I'm gonna do.

01:02:14.296 --> 01:02:16.462
Y'all need to stop
all this foolishness.

01:02:16.464 --> 01:02:17.464
Stop it right now,
and I mean it!

01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:19.765
I done been known
to take young hoes before.

01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:21.334
I can help you with that.

01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:22.701
Now, come on. I done
put the suit in the car.

01:02:22.703 --> 01:02:24.236
We're gonna bring it on
over to the funeral.

01:02:24.238 --> 01:02:25.537
Gonna get
all this straightened.

01:02:25.539 --> 01:02:27.240
Why the hell they
sending y'all somewhere?

01:02:27.242 --> 01:02:29.375
To help with the funeral.
Who else gonna do it?

01:02:29.377 --> 01:02:32.178
Hell, a professional.
What the hell is sending you...

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.613
No, two girls and a dude.

01:02:33.615 --> 01:02:34.747
Joe, have you
not been sitting here

01:02:34.749 --> 01:02:37.183
listening to what the hell
we just said? They said...

01:02:37.185 --> 01:02:38.450
Come on here, come on.

01:02:38.452 --> 01:02:40.185
Don't y'all say nothing,
you hear me? Nothing!

01:02:40.187 --> 01:02:42.721
- Now, listen up.
- This about to be a mess.

01:02:42.723 --> 01:02:44.390
- A damn mess.
- You the mess!

01:02:44.392 --> 01:02:46.658
- Come on. Come on, Bam.
- Go ahead on, Mabel.

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.662
Shotgun!

01:02:51.466 --> 01:02:52.598
Are you okay?

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.533
Yeah, what's up?

01:02:54.535 --> 01:02:55.671
You tell me.

01:02:56.571 --> 01:02:57.870
What're you talking about?

01:02:57.872 --> 01:02:59.772
Something's been off
with us lately.

01:02:59.774 --> 01:03:02.808
Could you just tell me
what's wrong?

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:05.245
There's nothing wrong.

01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:07.582
You act like you can't
stand me sometimes.

01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:11.350
That's not it.

01:03:11.352 --> 01:03:12.618
Uh, I'm just...

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:13.856
What? So what is it?

01:03:14.923 --> 01:03:16.455
Look, my daddy just died.

01:03:16.457 --> 01:03:18.126
You can't seem
to understand that.

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:20.095
I'm sorry.

01:03:28.303 --> 01:03:29.836
Hey, A.J., I need
to talk to you.

01:03:29.838 --> 01:03:31.307
Not right now.

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:38.611
Hey, babe.

01:03:38.613 --> 01:03:39.815
Baby, um...

01:03:41.482 --> 01:03:43.716
I don't know
how to say this.

01:03:43.718 --> 01:03:45.218
What is it?

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.589
I think A.J.
and Gia are...

01:03:47.856 --> 01:03:49.354
What?

01:03:49.356 --> 01:03:50.756
I don't know,
but he smells like her,

01:03:50.758 --> 01:03:52.892
and I saw him coming
out of her room.

01:03:52.894 --> 01:03:54.493
- Where was Jessie?
- Not here.

01:03:54.495 --> 01:03:55.595
Damn.

01:03:55.597 --> 01:03:57.564
Can you talk
to them for me?

01:03:57.566 --> 01:03:58.631
Yeah.

01:03:58.633 --> 01:04:00.700
I don't want this to turn
into a big mess, okay?

01:04:00.702 --> 01:04:02.267
Don't worry about it.
I'll talk to 'em.

01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:03.703
Okay. All right.
Thank you.

01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:05.504
I'm so glad
I can count on you.

01:04:05.506 --> 01:04:06.605
You always can.

01:04:06.607 --> 01:04:07.743
Yeah, thank you.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.781
Dang!
You work quick.

01:04:14.783 --> 01:04:18.850
Miss Vianne said that
we wanted it done quickly.

01:04:18.852 --> 01:04:21.787
Do you do
everything quickly?

01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:22.888
Hattie, hush!

01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:24.591
I only speak slowly.

01:04:24.593 --> 01:04:26.792
I'm actually pretty quick.

01:04:26.794 --> 01:04:29.796
Ooh. That's good.

01:04:30.966 --> 01:04:33.633
He really kind of
creepy, Mabel.

01:04:33.635 --> 01:04:34.968
Yes, he is.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:38.270
I know they're
creepy, but damn!

01:04:38.272 --> 01:04:40.939
We have him in the
suit you brought over.

01:04:40.941 --> 01:04:44.843
This is our
least expensive casket.

01:04:44.845 --> 01:04:46.879
Wait, you finna open that?
Give us some warning

01:04:46.881 --> 01:04:48.647
- before you just open it up.
- Right.

01:04:48.649 --> 01:04:50.816
We sent all the information
over to Vianne.

01:04:50.818 --> 01:04:52.417
- Are you ready?
- Um...

01:04:52.419 --> 01:04:54.490
Yes. If you gonna open it,
go on. Open it.

01:04:57.024 --> 01:04:58.426
Slow!

01:05:00.028 --> 01:05:01.928
He smiling.

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:03.895
- Huh.
- What do you think?

01:05:03.897 --> 01:05:05.932
He actually
look pretty good.

01:05:05.934 --> 01:05:08.301
He was a fine man.

01:05:08.303 --> 01:05:09.368
He don't look bad.

01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:10.803
Yeah, worked out
all the time,

01:05:10.805 --> 01:05:13.538
- ain't eatin' nothing but salads.
- Maybe that's right.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.408
And green drinks
and stuff like that.

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:17.042
He done got dead now, Mabel.

01:05:17.044 --> 01:05:17.944
Didn't eat no pork.

01:05:17.946 --> 01:05:19.879
And look at him,
we done outlived him.

01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:22.714
Laying there dead,
and we still alive, still kicking.

01:05:22.716 --> 01:05:24.616
That pork got us
kicking, though!

01:05:24.618 --> 01:05:26.519
Bacon ain't
never hurt nobody!

01:05:26.521 --> 01:05:29.055
Better get you a slab!
Too late now, though.

01:05:29.057 --> 01:05:30.390
Baby,
why he smiling?

01:05:30.392 --> 01:05:31.890
Y'all put the smile
on his face?

01:05:31.892 --> 01:05:34.394
He seemed like
he was a happy man

01:05:34.396 --> 01:05:36.328
in his final moments.

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:37.930
It stuck.

01:05:37.932 --> 01:05:39.698
- Oh, okay.
- What?

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.500
Are you satisfied?

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:43.636
Yes, we're very satisfied.
He looks fine.

01:05:43.638 --> 01:05:44.770
But he ain't.

01:05:44.772 --> 01:05:46.872
No, he's not satisfied.

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.908
- Mother...
- Hmm.

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:51.914
We're sorry. Mmm-hmm.

01:05:53.314 --> 01:05:56.883
Apparently, he was taking
some sort of stimulant.

01:05:56.885 --> 01:05:58.917
We're having some trouble

01:05:58.919 --> 01:06:00.752
keeping the thing... It...

01:06:00.754 --> 01:06:01.787
Down.

01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:03.855
What is "it"?
What you talking about?

01:06:03.857 --> 01:06:05.924
- The lid on the casket or...
- Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

01:06:05.926 --> 01:06:06.928
Move.

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:10.562
It's still up.

01:06:10.564 --> 01:06:11.798
Mmm.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.732
And it's still working?

01:06:13.734 --> 01:06:15.634
It's probably what killed him.

01:06:15.636 --> 01:06:17.736
Wait a minute.
This thing won't close?

01:06:17.738 --> 01:06:18.874
Mmm-mmm...

01:06:25.714 --> 01:06:27.479
It's like a pinball machine!

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.783
Okay, just try to tape
it down or something,

01:06:30.785 --> 01:06:32.517
'cause we don't want
this thing opening like a...

01:06:32.519 --> 01:06:34.087
Popping...

01:06:34.089 --> 01:06:35.055
Popping...

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:37.390
Popping up like that
in the funeral. Okay?

01:06:37.392 --> 01:06:38.524
What can you do?

01:06:38.526 --> 01:06:41.026
We could remove it,
if you like.

01:06:41.028 --> 01:06:43.495
- You mean...
- Hmm.

01:06:43.497 --> 01:06:44.930
Oh, no. We ain't
finna let you do that.

01:06:44.932 --> 01:06:46.531
No, we ain't gonna
Lorena Bobbitt him none.

01:06:46.533 --> 01:06:47.433
That don't seem right.

01:06:47.435 --> 01:06:49.405
Going into heaven
without your stuff.

01:06:53.707 --> 01:06:54.709
Hey.

01:06:55.943 --> 01:06:56.944
Hey.

01:06:58.046 --> 01:06:59.678
You good, man?

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.147
I will, once I get home.

01:07:01.149 --> 01:07:02.814
Yeah.

01:07:02.816 --> 01:07:04.450
I know this is hard for you.

01:07:04.452 --> 01:07:06.685
No, what's hard
for me is Carol.

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:08.453
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

01:07:08.455 --> 01:07:10.589
What? She sent you
down here to talk to me?

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.792
No. Sylvia did.

01:07:12.794 --> 01:07:13.828
What?

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.497
She wanted me
to talk to you about Gia.

01:07:17.499 --> 01:07:18.930
What about Gia?

01:07:18.932 --> 01:07:20.468
Anything going on there?

01:07:21.468 --> 01:07:23.069
Come on, what?

01:07:23.071 --> 01:07:24.904
She saw you
in her room, and...

01:07:24.906 --> 01:07:26.975
Oh, man, go on with that.

01:07:27.675 --> 01:07:28.741
You sure?

01:07:28.743 --> 01:07:30.642
Yeah, don't ask me that.

01:07:30.644 --> 01:07:31.646
Okay.

01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:35.448
Then you might wanna
start showering more,

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:36.685
because you smell like her.

01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:39.785
She hugged me.

01:07:39.787 --> 01:07:41.120
Y'all serious?

01:07:41.122 --> 01:07:43.723
- That's my brother's girlfriend.
- Fiancee.

01:07:43.725 --> 01:07:44.790
Yeah, that, too.

01:07:44.792 --> 01:07:45.827
Look...

01:07:47.095 --> 01:07:49.462
Y'all just go in there,
do y'all thing, man.

01:07:49.464 --> 01:07:51.066
Sylvia's just tripping.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.100
Now, if you don't mind...

01:07:54.102 --> 01:07:57.071
I have to figure out how to help my
mama with this funeral, all right?

01:07:58.071 --> 01:07:59.073
Okay.

01:08:05.879 --> 01:08:06.881
Hey.

01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:08.950
You okay?

01:08:15.089 --> 01:08:16.825
He acts like he hates me.

01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:18.858
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.225
I just wanna
know the truth.

01:08:20.227 --> 01:08:21.430
Look...

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:25.697
Our dad did
just die suddenly.

01:08:25.698 --> 01:08:28.501
This has been going on
for months before he died.

01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:29.868
I don't get it.

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.906
Just keep it
together. Okay?

01:08:32.906 --> 01:08:34.109
You'll be fine.

She ain't been

01:09:38.971 --> 01:09:41.206
as we come for this
conspicious occasion.

01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:43.009
Who gonna read the obituary?

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.609
Daddy. Shh.

01:09:44.611 --> 01:09:47.112
I want you to know
this is our program.

01:09:47.113 --> 01:09:48.617
It's really thick.

01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:50.849

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:52.652
How long is this
service gonna be?

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:54.819
So we want everybody
to be limited

01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:56.755
who come up here
to two minutes.

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:58.090
Two minutes, please.

01:09:58.092 --> 01:10:00.693
Don't sing long as...

01:10:00.695 --> 01:10:02.995
heaven like they just did.
Please.

01:10:02.997 --> 01:10:04.296
First, I would
like to start off

01:10:04.298 --> 01:10:07.602
with this for Anthony and for the family.

01:10:14.976 --> 01:10:16.709
No, I'm just playing.

01:10:16.711 --> 01:10:18.643
That ain't in the program
for this funeral. Okay.

01:10:18.645 --> 01:10:20.179
Madea,
I wanna say something.

01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:21.279
Heathrow.

01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:23.349
They can't hear me.
I guess it's not loud enough.

01:10:23.351 --> 01:10:24.716
That thing don't go up.

01:10:24.718 --> 01:10:25.952
It's all one volume.

01:10:25.954 --> 01:10:27.886
I'm so disappointed.

01:10:27.888 --> 01:10:29.054
Why, baby, why?

01:10:29.056 --> 01:10:30.255
Okay.

01:10:30.257 --> 01:10:33.725
'Cause his legs ain't fine
and sexy like they used to be.

01:10:33.727 --> 01:10:35.060
First, we gonna have...

01:10:35.062 --> 01:10:36.362
Hush, Hattie.

01:10:36.364 --> 01:10:38.130
...reading from our pastor.

01:10:38.132 --> 01:10:41.267
Then we gonna have the
reading of the new testimony,

01:10:41.269 --> 01:10:43.669
then we have the reading
of the old testimony.

01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:45.871
Hey. Check her out.

01:10:45.873 --> 01:10:48.240
Before the night is over,
I'm getting that.

01:10:48.242 --> 01:10:49.274
Then we have
a reading from Psalms.

01:10:49.276 --> 01:10:52.010
I wish I still had my legs,
I would help you.

01:10:52.012 --> 01:10:54.145
Then we gonna have
a word from the father...

01:10:54.147 --> 01:10:56.182
- Hey, how're you doing, babe?
- ...of the dead.

01:10:56.184 --> 01:10:59.050
Fine, how're you doing?

01:10:59.052 --> 01:11:01.120
She can play hard to
get if she want to.

01:11:01.122 --> 01:11:03.089
Then we gonna have
words from his sister.

01:11:03.091 --> 01:11:04.256
Yup.

01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:07.960
I know it's hard for you
because your husband is dead.

01:11:07.962 --> 01:11:10.228
I mean, dead.
He ain't coming back no more.

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:12.697
He ain't gonna
study war no more.

01:11:12.699 --> 01:11:15.100
Then we gonna have word from his
Aunt Shirleen. I saw her here.

01:11:15.102 --> 01:11:17.769
Hey, baby, I ain't seen you since
around the way. How you doing?

01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:19.738
I'm barely holding up.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.072
It's hard for me.

01:11:21.074 --> 01:11:23.175
It's hard having
a loss in the family.

01:11:23.177 --> 01:11:24.343
You gonna be all
right, Shirleen.

01:11:24.345 --> 01:11:25.844
Good to see you
over there.

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.078
Then we gonna have

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.148
a song, a A, and a B,
and a C, and a D,

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:30.849
and an F, and a G,
and a H,

01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:33.018
and a J, K, L, M, N, O, P
from the choir.

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.755
Phew. That's just
the first page.

01:11:35.757 --> 01:11:38.858
I've looked through
all 85 pages of this program

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.425
and your name ain't on
it, Heathrow.

01:11:40.427 --> 01:11:42.060
Better my name
be on the program

01:11:42.062 --> 01:11:44.063
than my name
be on the cover.

01:11:44.065 --> 01:11:45.264
Then I'm going
to read a poem

01:11:45.266 --> 01:11:47.233
that was written
by Maya Angelou.

01:11:47.235 --> 01:11:50.335
It's called <i>The Rock,
The Tree, and The River.</i>

01:11:50.337 --> 01:11:53.038
She knows she's finna
burn up in hell up there.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.706
We would
like to acknowledge

01:11:54.708 --> 01:11:56.207
all of y'all for being here

01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:57.276
'cause y'all so special.

01:11:57.278 --> 01:12:00.246
But we just want the family
on this side, okay?

01:12:00.248 --> 01:12:03.749
So if you just a friend of his
or you just know him,

01:12:03.751 --> 01:12:07.085
I want you to please
come to this side of the room.

01:12:07.087 --> 01:12:08.623
Please.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.460
Look at them. Look at them.
Look at them.

01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:18.096
Oh! Excuse me.
I got you.

01:12:18.098 --> 01:12:20.198
- Stop! Move.
- Sorry. All right, all right.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.367
All right, all right.

01:12:22.369 --> 01:12:23.768
Look at that tattoo.

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:24.903
What that say?

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:27.005
You see that tattoo?

01:12:27.007 --> 01:12:29.875
Joanne! What is you
doing up in here?

01:12:29.877 --> 01:12:31.242
You trying
to scam somebody?

01:12:31.244 --> 01:12:32.777
No, child.

01:12:32.779 --> 01:12:34.779
Please, this is not
a Caucasian funeral.

01:12:34.781 --> 01:12:37.782
Would you mind leaving?
Please. Step. 'Tep.

01:12:37.784 --> 01:12:39.984
Watch your purses and your
wallet. Joanne's a scammer.

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:45.825
You know
you want me.

01:12:45.827 --> 01:12:47.361
She all up on me.

01:12:50.064 --> 01:12:52.331
Ain't nobody on
this side but dudes.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:54.133
Anthony was the man.

01:12:54.135 --> 01:12:57.202
Anthony was the man.

01:12:57.204 --> 01:12:59.971
Sorry, Vianne,
I'm trying to whisper.

01:12:59.973 --> 01:13:02.843
Okay, first, we're gonna have
words from the son-in-law.

01:13:07.248 --> 01:13:10.215
Well, it's a sad occasion.

01:13:10.217 --> 01:13:13.318

01:13:45.086 --> 01:13:48.120
Brother Anthony,
he was a good man.

01:13:48.122 --> 01:13:49.857
He was a strong man.

01:13:50.857 --> 01:13:52.524
He owed me $5.

01:13:52.526 --> 01:13:54.492
You ain't never gonna
get that, I'm telling you.

01:13:54.494 --> 01:13:55.894
'Cause they got
all the money.

01:13:55.896 --> 01:13:57.295
I'm looking at where
all the money done went.

01:13:57.297 --> 01:13:59.734
If you knew Anthony,
raise your hand.

01:14:02.837 --> 01:14:06.005
Okay. If you knew
Anthony personally,

01:14:06.007 --> 01:14:07.142
raise your hand.

01:14:08.976 --> 01:14:10.408
- If you knew Anthony...
- Mom, who are these people?

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:13.981
...like they say in the
Bible, biblically, raise your hand.

01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:18.584
Oh, hell, no.

01:14:18.586 --> 01:14:20.518
Well, hopefully, when I
see him on the other side...

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.154
- Yeah!
- ...he still got a little change left for me.

01:14:23.156 --> 01:14:25.157
- Amen. Amen.
- Amen.

01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:27.091
Amen. Is it time to go?

01:14:27.093 --> 01:14:28.960
How long we gotta be
up in here, Bam?

01:14:28.962 --> 01:14:30.164
Joe, hush.

01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:32.465
Lord!

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:36.301
We need you to come
down at this time

01:14:36.303 --> 01:14:41.240
and grasp the family,
if you will.

01:14:41.242 --> 01:14:43.908
They are
in trouble right now.

01:14:44.945 --> 01:14:48.581
Put your hands around them
and hold them tight.

01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:51.983
Because they've been
through so many changes.

Maybe she's in shock.

Y'all know Mama's strong.

01:15:03.998 --> 01:15:05.898
We just gotta watch her
and make sure she's okay.

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.899
Yeah, she is.

01:15:09.537 --> 01:15:12.571
I just wanna say
to the bereaved,

01:15:12.573 --> 01:15:15.174
it's gonna be all right.

01:15:15.176 --> 01:15:17.343
You'll see him
on the other side.

01:15:17.345 --> 01:15:20.144
On which side,
I don't know which side,

01:15:20.146 --> 01:15:23.182

the other side the other week,

01:15:23.184 --> 01:15:24.916

Ouch. That hurt like hell.

01:16:20.607 --> 01:16:23.442
Ain't nobody trying to

that's all you can do.

01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:35.554
Can a player get

01:16:35.556 --> 01:16:39.390
Because you done

01:16:39.392 --> 01:16:41.327
Can a player

01:16:41.329 --> 01:16:43.431

I send my

01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:20.198
Losing your son
ain't ever easy.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.401
I'mma sing a song I wrote.
You don't mind, do you?

01:17:22.403 --> 01:17:23.702
Yeah, go on,

<i>♪ You had 10,000 women</i>

01:17:37.385 --> 01:17:40.452
How long is this woman

01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:43.389
I don't know, but she need
to sit down and shut up!

01:17:43.391 --> 01:17:45.691
<i>♪ And it's all right</i>

01:17:45.693 --> 01:17:47.626
<i>♪ You got your robe ♪</i>

01:17:47.628 --> 01:17:49.495
God said, "Shirleen,
write this song

01:17:49.497 --> 01:17:50.496
"and give it to the family."

01:17:50.498 --> 01:17:54.265
Because people done
spit on the man's name!

01:17:54.267 --> 01:17:56.035
They done shamed him.

01:17:56.037 --> 01:17:58.770
And these women
who came in here

01:17:58.772 --> 01:18:01.173
in front of this
man's poor wife.

01:18:01.175 --> 01:18:04.309
He got his robe,
it don't matter what the haters say.

01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:07.478
He got his robe.
He got his robe!

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.548
The man is dead.
He ain't coming back.

01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:11.716
Why they making all
this noise up in here?

01:18:11.718 --> 01:18:16.388
When was the last time
you were in church?

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:20.192
You remember that time me
and you was under them pews?

01:18:20.194 --> 01:18:22.260
- That was the last time?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:24.095
And I never went back.

01:18:24.097 --> 01:18:26.298
Now we getting
ready to view the body.

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.099
The family's gonna go last

01:18:28.101 --> 01:18:30.234
and all of y'all people
that didn't know him

01:18:30.236 --> 01:18:31.569
or didn't wash your hands,

01:18:31.571 --> 01:18:33.104
please be careful.

01:18:33.106 --> 01:18:34.673
Don't touch the man.

01:18:34.675 --> 01:18:36.474
Don't pull him up
out the casket.

01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:38.109
Can you let me sing?

01:18:38.111 --> 01:18:39.844
I was in the band
with Rick James.

01:18:39.846 --> 01:18:43.017
Can I sing
<i>She's a Super Freak?</i>

01:18:43.818 --> 01:18:45.783
Maybe that's
not appropriate.

01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:47.352
Okay.

01:18:47.354 --> 01:18:49.455
Shirleen, you blessed
my soul just then.

01:18:49.457 --> 01:18:51.657
You really did.
You really did.

01:18:51.659 --> 01:18:54.792
We are very happy
that he is, uh, with the Lord.

01:18:54.794 --> 01:18:57.563
That's right, with the Lord. Mr. Pallbearers!

01:18:57.565 --> 01:18:59.430
Take the flowers
off the casket.

01:18:59.432 --> 01:19:02.334
Don't tear up the flowers,
they wasn't cheap.

01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:04.670
Before y'all all
rush up here to say

01:19:04.672 --> 01:19:06.638
your goodbyes
and your condolences...

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.874
Ugh. I wish that dude
would shut up.

01:19:08.876 --> 01:19:11.510
We just want y'all
to respect the family

01:19:11.512 --> 01:19:13.578
and I want y'all
to respect his wife.

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.880
This is a church. I don't mind
busting you in your face.

01:19:15.882 --> 01:19:17.883
Lord, ask Jesus
to forgive me.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:19.852
If they come up here
with that bull...

01:19:27.328 --> 01:19:30.461
Okay, funeral over.
Everybody, go. Whoo.

01:19:30.463 --> 01:19:34.599
Help me, Jesus! Help me,
Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

01:19:34.601 --> 01:19:37.404
Help me, Jesus! Help me,
Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

01:19:41.342 --> 01:19:43.642
Mama, why do we all
have to be here?

01:19:43.644 --> 01:19:47.312
It's a repass, son.
For your father. Okay?

01:19:47.314 --> 01:19:49.284
You sure don't
seem too upset.

01:19:50.684 --> 01:19:52.220
Have you been drinking?

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.553
Well...

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:56.124
Look, just let her do it
the way she want to, okay?

01:19:56.656 --> 01:19:57.659
Come on, Mama.

01:19:59.426 --> 01:20:02.493
- It was a nice service.
- Yes, it was. I did good.

01:20:02.495 --> 01:20:04.496
It was lovely.
It was really lovely. Uh-huh.

01:20:04.498 --> 01:20:06.665
It was quick,
is what it was.

01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:08.901
Lickety-split.
We was in, and we was out.

01:20:08.903 --> 01:20:11.170
I don't know why
you think that was quick.

01:20:11.172 --> 01:20:12.336
That was long as hell.

01:20:12.338 --> 01:20:13.671
That service was so long,

01:20:13.673 --> 01:20:16.175
I was sitting there
watching my toenails grow.

01:20:16.177 --> 01:20:18.277
You must've got them there
on that discount plan, Ma.

01:20:18.279 --> 01:20:19.545
You got them the hookup?

01:20:19.547 --> 01:20:21.712
I ain't get no damn hookup.
Yeah, that bill was high as hell.

01:20:21.714 --> 01:20:23.482
Did he say he sent it you?
Did he send it over there to you?

01:20:23.484 --> 01:20:26.120
I got it. It's right over there.
On the lamp.

01:20:27.687 --> 01:20:28.754
What?

01:20:28.756 --> 01:20:30.492
It cost this much
to bury him?

01:20:33.793 --> 01:20:36.894
Good God! That's how much
that funeral cost, $9,000?

01:20:36.896 --> 01:20:38.529
We should've
buried his ass in a box

01:20:38.531 --> 01:20:40.232
and put him up
under the ground.

01:20:40.234 --> 01:20:42.466
People think folk be crying
'cause of the dead.

01:20:42.468 --> 01:20:46.505
They crying 'cause their
funeral bill is $9,000!

01:20:46.507 --> 01:20:48.340
Do you know how much
ass I could get

01:20:48.342 --> 01:20:50.908
for 9,670-something dollars?

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:53.377
Y'all spending it
on a dead man?

01:20:53.379 --> 01:20:56.814
Gonna bury that man
for 9,000 damn dollars.

01:20:56.816 --> 01:20:58.282
That's a damn shame.

01:20:58.284 --> 01:20:59.818
I'll remember that
when you die.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.754
I get a state funeral.
I'm a war hero.

01:21:02.756 --> 01:21:04.622
You ain't no war hero.

01:21:04.624 --> 01:21:06.224
He said that's
how he lost his legs.

01:21:06.226 --> 01:21:08.292
That is exactly
how I lost my legs.

01:21:08.294 --> 01:21:09.894
You know how
he lost his damn legs?

01:21:09.896 --> 01:21:13.631
He messed around with some gangster's
wife and they got them legs off of you!

01:21:13.633 --> 01:21:16.635
Bet you gonna learn next time.

01:21:16.637 --> 01:21:18.737
You just gonna tell
all a player's secrets?

01:21:18.739 --> 01:21:20.438
Player, you ain't
got no secret.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.375
All them damn medals,
you done got from the Wal-Mart.

01:21:23.377 --> 01:21:26.277
Tell the truth, you lost them
legs 'cause you are diabetical.

01:21:26.279 --> 01:21:28.580
And everything that they started
adding up in them diabetical

01:21:28.582 --> 01:21:30.682
led you to lose your legs.
That went wrong.

01:21:30.684 --> 01:21:32.617
You better stop
all that damn smoking.

01:21:32.619 --> 01:21:35.786
If you stop that damn smoking,
then you'll be in good shape.

01:21:35.788 --> 01:21:36.925
We don't smoke in here.

01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:42.361
Boujee ass.
"We don't smoke in the house."

01:21:42.363 --> 01:21:44.395
Mama, the funeral
was very nice.

01:21:44.397 --> 01:21:47.799
- That funeral was lovely. It was lovely.
- Yeah, Mama. It was.

01:21:47.801 --> 01:21:48.867
You doing okay?

01:21:48.869 --> 01:21:51.502
I'll be fine,
now that this funeral is over.

01:21:51.504 --> 01:21:53.839
The man just died
two days ago

01:21:53.841 --> 01:21:56.508
and you already done shoved
him up under the dirt.

01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:58.309
My cousin died
three years ago,

01:21:58.311 --> 01:21:59.644
they still ain't buried him.

01:21:59.646 --> 01:22:01.313
They still
ain't buried Jerome?

01:22:01.315 --> 01:22:02.848
- Why?
- Because they don't have the money.

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.683
Funeral was
about $485,

01:22:04.685 --> 01:22:06.718
so the whole family,
all 75 of us,

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.319
chipped in trying to pay it.

01:22:08.321 --> 01:22:10.788
And we all give a little money
at a time to bury him,

01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:13.724
but one day we gonna get him buried.
But he just laying there...

01:22:13.726 --> 01:22:16.527
He worm meat right now,
but black folk, no.

01:22:16.529 --> 01:22:18.663
We gotta put the body
on layaway.

01:22:18.665 --> 01:22:20.066
When white people die,
know what they do?

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:22.934
They walk up in there,
they put the white people there, they say,

01:22:22.936 --> 01:22:25.437
"Thank you for being here.
My white daddy died

01:22:25.439 --> 01:22:27.872
"and I want all the white people to
say, 'Amen, God bless.'"

01:22:27.874 --> 01:22:30.309
And then all the white people get
up, and they leave. That's it.

01:22:30.311 --> 01:22:33.010
Funeral gone. In the ground.
White man dead.

01:22:33.012 --> 01:22:35.580
When my Chinese friend
died from Korea,

01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:38.649
they put him in a box
and put some rice in it

01:22:38.651 --> 01:22:40.719
and sent him down
the Vietnam River.

01:22:40.721 --> 01:22:42.754
That was when I was
in the war in Iraq.

01:22:42.756 --> 01:22:44.089
That's right. I seen
a Chinese man

01:22:44.091 --> 01:22:45.791
from Korea,
they buried him.

01:22:45.793 --> 01:22:46.925
Quick. It was over.

01:22:46.927 --> 01:22:47.893
Jewish men, you know
what they do?

01:22:47.895 --> 01:22:50.528
At sundown, everybody got
to be in the ground.

01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:51.729
Please don't forget the wake.

01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:53.764
I don't know why
they call it a wake.

01:22:53.766 --> 01:22:56.734
He dead. Ain't no need
to wake his ass up.

01:22:56.736 --> 01:22:58.937
That's why that bill was
$9,000, 'cause you had a wake.

01:22:58.939 --> 01:23:00.871
Should've had no wake,
but then had the funeral,

01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:03.075
dropped his ass in the
dirt, put the dirt on,

01:23:03.077 --> 01:23:05.344
everything over,
God bless, benediction,

01:23:05.346 --> 01:23:07.978
"May the Lord watch between
me and thee," everybody goes.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.747
Right. It's a dead.

01:23:09.749 --> 01:23:11.683
No, a wake is...

01:23:11.685 --> 01:23:15.053
Our ancestors started it.
All of the ancestors...

01:23:15.055 --> 01:23:17.389
Bam, you are
our ancestor from Africa.

01:23:17.391 --> 01:23:18.691
Please be quiet. Please!

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:21.026
Mabel, I'm just trying to tell
you how Frederick Douglass,

01:23:21.028 --> 01:23:22.693
well, Harriet Tubman,
really...

01:23:22.695 --> 01:23:24.095
Listen, I know you knew
all them people.

01:23:24.097 --> 01:23:25.296
Hush your damn mouth.

01:23:25.298 --> 01:23:28.367
My bladder is too weak to be
sitting around at a funeral

01:23:28.369 --> 01:23:30.602
looking at a dead man
with a dead bladder.

01:23:30.604 --> 01:23:32.002
That's just what the hell
I've been doing

01:23:32.004 --> 01:23:34.639
sitting here looking at
a dead man all this time.

01:23:34.641 --> 01:23:36.907
Dead man rolling.

01:23:36.909 --> 01:23:38.076
Stop it now, y'all.

01:23:38.078 --> 01:23:39.643
Have some respect.
He just died.

01:23:39.645 --> 01:23:40.845
What the hell
you think we're doing?

01:23:40.847 --> 01:23:42.913
We sitting here
showing him some respect.

01:23:42.915 --> 01:23:45.384
That's what I'm doing, talking
about him. That's respect.

01:23:45.386 --> 01:23:47.385
I'm sorry, did that
hurt your feelings?

01:23:47.387 --> 01:23:48.652
The man was dead.

01:23:48.654 --> 01:23:50.822
We didn't have
to be there that long.

01:23:50.824 --> 01:23:52.758
Y'all ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.492
That is torture
to a corpse.

01:23:54.494 --> 01:23:57.828
Okay, you two, stop it.
Stop it right now.

01:23:57.830 --> 01:24:00.499
You don't tell me what...

01:24:00.501 --> 01:24:02.567
Joe and Heathrow,
shut your damn mouth.

01:24:02.569 --> 01:24:03.969
- Mabel!
- What?

01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:06.537
His sound don't come
from his mouth, honey.

01:24:06.539 --> 01:24:08.572
Well, I'm getting ready to plug that
hole up so he can shut the hell up.

01:24:08.574 --> 01:24:10.975
That's where it comes from.
That hole in his throat.

01:24:12.479 --> 01:24:13.545
Spare.

01:24:13.547 --> 01:24:15.714
Vianne, you done bought him
two of them damn things?

01:24:15.716 --> 01:24:16.848
Why the hell would you
buy him two?

01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:18.483
Mmm-mmm.
I didn't do that.

01:24:18.485 --> 01:24:19.751
I wish you would
shut your hole up.

01:24:19.753 --> 01:24:21.519
- Oh!
- Let me tell you something.

01:24:21.521 --> 01:24:23.988
I'm gonna plug that hole... I'm gonna plug...
I'm gonna plug... I'm gonna plug that...

01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:26.758
Say one more thing, okay? Shut your
mouth before I take that one tooth

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.363
you got left up
in your throat.

01:24:30.029 --> 01:24:32.197
You will not sit here
and threaten my tooth.

01:24:32.199 --> 01:24:34.933
That's all I have left,
is that one good tooth up top.

01:24:34.935 --> 01:24:36.801
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna give you a Cheerio,

01:24:36.803 --> 01:24:38.836
so you can put that on
the tooth like some braces.

01:24:38.838 --> 01:24:40.005
Say one more thing!

01:24:40.007 --> 01:24:42.441
Get him some cotton candy.

01:24:42.443 --> 01:24:43.974
Yeah, give him
a corn on the cob.

01:24:43.976 --> 01:24:46.678
He'll be able to just go down one row.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.779
Stop it now, y'all.
Stop it. That's enough.

01:24:48.781 --> 01:24:50.982
You wanna mess him up,
give him a Cap'n Crunch.

01:24:52.586 --> 01:24:54.685
I'll give him
a Rice Krispies Treat.

01:24:56.757 --> 01:24:58.023
Somebody better get my rifle.

01:24:58.025 --> 01:25:01.559
I see a enemy target at six
hundred oh thirty-four hours.

01:25:01.561 --> 01:25:03.562
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:25:03.564 --> 01:25:05.095
Babe, you all right?

01:25:05.097 --> 01:25:08.700
I sure know how
it feel to lose somebody.

01:25:08.702 --> 01:25:10.469
- Hattie.
- What, Ma? I do.

01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:12.670
I'll never forget
I buried my last...

01:25:12.672 --> 01:25:13.839
First three husbands.

01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:14.874
Hattie.

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:18.676
I was devastation, Ma,
I was just devastation.

01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:22.147
You talk about devastation,
try to have sex with her.

01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:23.115
- Renee.
- Yeah?

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:26.151
Thank you for coming.
You're always here.

01:25:26.153 --> 01:25:27.885
I always will be.

01:25:27.887 --> 01:25:29.187
She don't need to be here.

01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:30.255
Give me that.

01:25:30.257 --> 01:25:31.555
Don't touch me.

01:25:31.557 --> 01:25:32.991
You don't need
to be drinking.

01:25:32.993 --> 01:25:34.158
You don't need
to be nagging me.

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.594
What is wrong with you?

01:25:35.596 --> 01:25:36.961
That's what the hell
I want to know, son.

01:25:36.963 --> 01:25:38.496
You better take some
of that tone out of your voice

01:25:38.498 --> 01:25:39.730
talking to that
woman like that.

01:25:39.732 --> 01:25:41.233
I'm not gonna sit here
and let that happen.

01:25:41.235 --> 01:25:42.870
Mama, he all right.

01:25:45.105 --> 01:25:46.203
Uh-oh.

01:25:46.205 --> 01:25:48.005
Come on, baby,
let's go upstairs.

01:25:48.007 --> 01:25:49.073
Why you running?

01:25:49.075 --> 01:25:51.041
A.J. Go sleep it off.

01:25:51.043 --> 01:25:53.511
Yeah. That's what
he liked to do.

01:25:53.513 --> 01:25:55.880
Sleep it off and on.
Ain't that right, Renee?

01:25:55.882 --> 01:25:58.452
Is there something
you're trying to say, A.J.?

01:25:58.985 --> 01:26:00.151
No.

01:26:00.153 --> 01:26:02.853
Are you sure?

01:26:02.855 --> 01:26:04.555
- No, ma'am.
- What's going on?

01:26:04.557 --> 01:26:07.091
'Cause I ain't got time
to be bothered with this

01:26:07.093 --> 01:26:08.693
and you
and your foolishness.

01:26:08.695 --> 01:26:10.828
- Why is it always me?
- 'Cause it is.

01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:11.929
You're just like
your daddy.

01:26:11.931 --> 01:26:13.665
I ain't nothing like him.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:15.133
I'm not gonna
argue with you.

01:26:15.135 --> 01:26:16.800
Hey, I know you're not
just gonna sit there.

01:26:16.802 --> 01:26:17.835
Aren't you gonna
say something?

01:26:17.837 --> 01:26:18.969
What the hell you asking me
to say something for?

01:26:18.971 --> 01:26:21.305
I ain't got nothing to say here.
I'm finna watch this.

01:26:21.307 --> 01:26:22.941
Too many secrets
need to come all out.

01:26:22.943 --> 01:26:25.210
Yeah, I wish
we had some popcorn.

01:26:25.212 --> 01:26:27.178
Come on. Vianne,
let's go upstairs.

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.612
We ain't gotta deal
with all this drama.

01:26:28.614 --> 01:26:30.247
I'm sick of this!

01:26:30.249 --> 01:26:33.050
You help her like you helped
my daddy in that hotel room.

01:26:33.052 --> 01:26:34.921
Yeah, they was in that hotel.

01:26:35.788 --> 01:26:37.057
That's how he died.

01:26:38.691 --> 01:26:40.024
She was with him.

01:26:40.026 --> 01:26:41.194
Ooh-ooh.

01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:47.098
Mama, look, that's the truth.
I'm sorry.

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.832
But it is.

01:26:48.834 --> 01:26:50.136
Is he telling the truth?

01:26:58.779 --> 01:26:59.911
Yeah.

01:26:59.913 --> 01:27:01.947
Ah. Fix it, Jesus.

01:27:01.949 --> 01:27:03.618
You need to leave.

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.589
Yeah, you right. I'll go.

01:27:10.757 --> 01:27:14.294
But why don't you ask him why
he was at the hotel, too, huh?

01:27:15.895 --> 01:27:17.728
Uh-oh. I believe it
done hit the fan.

01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:19.598
- Yeah.
- He ain't even cold yet.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.299
And you need to stop
messing around with Gia.

01:27:21.301 --> 01:27:23.068
- There it is.
- What?

01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:24.368
Since we putting it
all out there,

01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:25.670
you wanna tell
the whole family

01:27:25.672 --> 01:27:28.673
that you and A.J.
was at the same hotel as me and Anthony?

01:27:28.675 --> 01:27:29.843
What're you talking about?

01:27:30.343 --> 01:27:31.675
Oh.

01:27:31.677 --> 01:27:33.044
Sweetie, don't lie.

01:27:33.046 --> 01:27:34.612
See, 'cause that
just makes it worse.

01:27:34.614 --> 01:27:36.113
- What?
- Oh. Oh, yeah, Jessie.

01:27:36.115 --> 01:27:38.383
See, they were in the
same hotel room together

01:27:38.385 --> 01:27:41.219
in the room right next to us.
That's how they heard us.

01:27:41.221 --> 01:27:42.754
Now it's all out there.

01:27:42.756 --> 01:27:44.788
You need to get the
hell out of here now.

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:46.627
Just go.

01:27:47.628 --> 01:27:48.827
I'll go.

01:27:48.829 --> 01:27:50.394
But I told you.

01:27:50.396 --> 01:27:52.600
I'm not the one
to be played with.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.407
Gia?

01:28:02.409 --> 01:28:04.309
Baby, it's not
what you think.

01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:05.844
Okay.

01:28:05.846 --> 01:28:07.379
Come on.
We need to talk.

01:28:07.381 --> 01:28:08.583
Now!

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.756
What the hell you
looking at him for?

01:28:18.057 --> 01:28:20.090
- Let's go!
- Hey! Hey!

01:28:20.092 --> 01:28:22.227
What? Huh?

01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:23.631
What you got
to say to me?

01:28:24.064 --> 01:28:25.764
Say something.

01:28:25.766 --> 01:28:27.331
With your trifling ass.

01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:32.437
- Don't put your hands on her like that.
- Stop it, A.J. Stop it!

01:28:32.439 --> 01:28:34.906
Let's go, babe.
Let's go talk, come on!

01:28:34.908 --> 01:28:37.041
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

01:28:37.043 --> 01:28:39.279
Say something.
With your weak ass.

01:28:39.779 --> 01:28:40.944
Mmm-hmm.

01:28:40.946 --> 01:28:42.880
Like I thought.

01:28:42.882 --> 01:28:44.883
Just like your daddy
and your mama.

01:28:44.885 --> 01:28:46.216
- Stop it now.
- Come on. Step.

01:28:46.218 --> 01:28:47.318
Stop it right now!

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:48.687
Hey, cut it out, guys.

01:28:48.689 --> 01:28:51.288
Brian, shut up, bitch.
Shut up.

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:52.927
You sleeping with him?

01:28:53.827 --> 01:28:55.193
I'm sorry.

01:28:55.195 --> 01:28:57.761
Stop it, and stop it now.

01:28:57.763 --> 01:28:59.430
Hey. Stop it, guys.

01:28:59.432 --> 01:29:01.700
You all wanna
fight like animals.

01:29:01.702 --> 01:29:04.768
You just gonna let her walk
out of here like that, Mama?

01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:05.972
You're so damn weak.

01:29:06.707 --> 01:29:07.971
So you think I'm weak?

01:29:07.973 --> 01:29:09.107
Mama, he's drunk.

01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:10.908
No, that's what he said.

01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:13.013
Thinks I'm weak for
staying with his daddy.

01:29:14.714 --> 01:29:17.017
Sometimes,
I thought so, too.

01:29:17.984 --> 01:29:20.151
The first time
he cheated,

01:29:20.153 --> 01:29:23.020
I walked out on him.
Left him.

01:29:23.022 --> 01:29:25.055
He begged me
to come back.

01:29:25.057 --> 01:29:27.328
I was filled
with a weakness.

01:29:29.061 --> 01:29:30.461
Something y'all
don't know about

01:29:30.463 --> 01:29:31.832
called love.

01:29:32.732 --> 01:29:34.200
So I went back to him.

01:29:35.267 --> 01:29:37.902
Even then,
he didn't stop cheating.

01:29:37.904 --> 01:29:41.238
He just got better
at hiding it.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.010
The second time
he cheated,

01:29:44.177 --> 01:29:45.446
I left him again.

01:29:47.146 --> 01:29:48.748
You all were six,

01:29:49.281 --> 01:29:50.514
and four.

01:29:50.516 --> 01:29:52.952
And you were
on the way.

01:29:53.753 --> 01:29:55.756
What was I supposed to do?

01:29:56.388 --> 01:29:59.991
I didn't have no life skills.

01:29:59.993 --> 01:30:04.528
I went from my mama's house
and moved straight into his.

01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:06.266
But I left him.

01:30:06.932 --> 01:30:07.999
Wow.

01:30:08.001 --> 01:30:09.934
Walked right on out.

01:30:09.936 --> 01:30:12.836
Got me an apartment

01:30:12.838 --> 01:30:15.874
and a job working
as a secretary

01:30:15.876 --> 01:30:17.908
with no degree.

01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:22.182
And I had to leave y'all
with my crazy-ass family.

01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:25.183
After a while,

01:30:25.185 --> 01:30:27.754
I didn't know who I
was leaving y'all with.

01:30:29.288 --> 01:30:33.293
I couldn't protect you
and work at the same time,

01:30:34.828 --> 01:30:36.129
and he knew it.

01:30:37.163 --> 01:30:40.831
He was an arrogant son
of a bitch.

01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:45.002
This time, he didn't
beg me to come back.

01:30:45.004 --> 01:30:46.940
I had to make some choices.

01:30:48.107 --> 01:30:49.941
When he found me

01:30:49.943 --> 01:30:52.946
sitting on the doorstep
at his job,

01:30:56.082 --> 01:30:58.819
he asked me if I had
learned my lesson.

01:31:00.453 --> 01:31:04.288
I swallowed my pride
and said yes.

01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:07.794
He said, "I'll pick up
you and the kids."

01:31:10.963 --> 01:31:15.368
It was two more weeks
before he came back to get us.

01:31:16.468 --> 01:31:19.239
You say I'm weak.

01:31:20.073 --> 01:31:22.176
I say I'm strong.

01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:27.914
'Cause I spent years
smiling and grinning

01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:33.253
when I hated his damn guts!

01:31:34.221 --> 01:31:36.854
He never stopped cheating.

01:31:36.856 --> 01:31:39.560
He was a whore,
and that's what he did.

01:31:41.026 --> 01:31:44.461
But I kept
my damn mouth shut

01:31:44.463 --> 01:31:47.801
so he would
take care of you.

01:31:49.569 --> 01:31:52.036
So, forgive me

01:31:52.038 --> 01:31:55.305
if I didn't do it your
21st-century way

01:31:55.307 --> 01:31:58.376
with all your options.

01:31:58.378 --> 01:32:00.545
- Mama.
- No, "Mama" nothing.

01:32:00.547 --> 01:32:02.145
You're just like him.

01:32:02.147 --> 01:32:03.982
You got a good woman

01:32:03.984 --> 01:32:06.149
and you won't stop
whoring around on her.

01:32:06.151 --> 01:32:07.484
No, Mama.

01:32:07.486 --> 01:32:08.652
No.

01:32:08.654 --> 01:32:11.089
You hate. You rebel.

01:32:11.091 --> 01:32:12.860
You won't do right.

01:32:13.959 --> 01:32:16.594
Now, Carol,
you got options.

01:32:16.596 --> 01:32:18.630
No kids
and daddy's money.

01:32:18.632 --> 01:32:20.501
If I was in your position,

01:32:21.668 --> 01:32:23.401
I'd leave this boy

01:32:23.403 --> 01:32:26.973
until he found out
what the hell a man is.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.040
And, Jessie,

01:32:29.042 --> 01:32:32.210
you wanted your daddy's
attention so much,

01:32:32.212 --> 01:32:35.246
you found a woman
just like him.

01:32:35.248 --> 01:32:37.482
Mama, I'm sorry.

01:32:37.484 --> 01:32:40.018
No. Don't be sorry.

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:41.422
I'm all right.

01:32:42.288 --> 01:32:44.154
I promise you.

01:32:44.156 --> 01:32:45.892
Now that your
daddy's gone,

01:32:46.493 --> 01:32:48.926
I'm gonna live for me.

01:32:48.928 --> 01:32:50.394
Y'all are grown.

01:32:50.396 --> 01:32:52.098
It's my time now.

01:33:00.507 --> 01:33:01.605
Let's go on
in the house.

01:33:01.607 --> 01:33:03.474
Hell, you know how people
in these nice neighborhoods,

01:33:03.476 --> 01:33:06.077
they don't care.

01:33:06.079 --> 01:33:08.345
Don't tell me nothing.
I'm going in here, and I'm gonna sit down.

01:33:08.347 --> 01:33:09.281
I ain't got nothing to say.

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:11.115
- That's exactly what you need to do.
- Mabel?

01:33:11.117 --> 01:33:14.285
- Huh?
- Leave me alone. Still got that funeral smell.

01:33:14.287 --> 01:33:16.487
It sure do. Hey, honey,
how you doing?

01:33:16.489 --> 01:33:17.522
- Hi.
- Y'all still here?

01:33:17.524 --> 01:33:19.456
I thought you'd be
gone after all of that.

01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:21.626
Yeah, we're...
We're leaving today.

01:33:21.628 --> 01:33:23.627
You all right? Sit down,
sit down, sit down.

01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:25.228
How things go with y'all?

01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:27.264
I'm just waiting for A.J.
to get up. I wanna talk to him.

01:33:27.266 --> 01:33:28.465
What you mean,
"waiting on him to get up"?

01:33:28.467 --> 01:33:31.568
He's asleep after all of this?
What you wanna talk about?

01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:33.304
I wanna leave him.

01:33:33.306 --> 01:33:34.371
Then that's
what you should do.

01:33:34.373 --> 01:33:35.439
She should walk
on out on his ass.

01:33:35.441 --> 01:33:36.508
That's it. What you do.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:39.042
But that's gonna hurt
like hell, and I don't...

01:33:39.044 --> 01:33:40.444
Baby,
just 'cause something hurt like hell

01:33:40.446 --> 01:33:41.679
don't mean you
ain't supposed to do it.

01:33:41.681 --> 01:33:43.648
Sometimes, you gotta
go through the hurt

01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:45.983
and the pain,
and the suffering or whatever the hell

01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:48.353
to get away from somebody
that ain't treating you right.

01:33:48.355 --> 01:33:49.720
Take some time
for yourself.

01:33:49.722 --> 01:33:51.089
Get away from the situation

01:33:51.091 --> 01:33:52.991
and really think
about it, pray about it,

01:33:52.993 --> 01:33:54.459
talk to God,
and see what it is.

01:33:54.461 --> 01:33:56.426
Lot of folk run out
on marriages too quick

01:33:56.428 --> 01:33:58.429
just 'cause somebody
messed around and cheated.

01:33:58.431 --> 01:34:01.331
Now, I'm not saying stay with
somebody that's cheating.

01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:02.700
What I'm telling you is this,

01:34:02.702 --> 01:34:05.036
sometime people
leave too early.

01:34:05.038 --> 01:34:08.072
Take your time,
try to figure out what's going on first.

01:34:08.074 --> 01:34:09.407
Well,
what if he does...

01:34:09.409 --> 01:34:10.640
- What if he does it again?
- You can't just sit there

01:34:10.642 --> 01:34:12.210
and let that happen over
and over again.

01:34:12.212 --> 01:34:14.011
Make him respect you.

01:34:14.013 --> 01:34:16.346
- I can see if you was ugly...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:34:16.348 --> 01:34:17.581
...but you ain't even ugly.

01:34:17.583 --> 01:34:19.349
No, she ain't ugly.
She's a pretty girl.

01:34:19.351 --> 01:34:20.550
You a pretty girl.

01:34:20.552 --> 01:34:22.420
Sometime ugly women have to
sit there and deal with that,

01:34:22.422 --> 01:34:24.255
- but not a pretty woman.
- They do.

01:34:24.257 --> 01:34:26.390
Not with a ass like yours.
Did you see this ass?

01:34:26.392 --> 01:34:29.660
I've never dealt with nothing
because of this ass right here.

01:34:29.662 --> 01:34:31.161
- Do you understand?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:34:31.163 --> 01:34:33.531
- You gotta make him respect you.
- That's right.

01:34:33.533 --> 01:34:35.566
When you got a ass,
you make him respect you.

01:34:35.568 --> 01:34:39.237
So this is what you need to do.
If you wanna be with the man, fine.

01:34:39.239 --> 01:34:41.805
That's your choice, your call.
Y'all figure it out.

01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:43.640
But you got to
set up some rules.

01:34:43.642 --> 01:34:46.077
You tell him, "Look,
if you break these rules,

01:34:46.079 --> 01:34:47.277
"I'mma break your neck."

01:34:47.279 --> 01:34:49.413
If you can't break his neck,
hire somebody.

01:34:49.415 --> 01:34:52.316
Look, $25. I got him.

01:34:52.318 --> 01:34:53.785
Sounds like
we're playing a game

01:34:53.787 --> 01:34:55.685
and I don't wanna
play games with him.

01:34:55.687 --> 01:34:57.755
It's not a game.
It's life.

01:34:57.757 --> 01:35:00.590
When somebody do something
to you that ain't right,

01:35:00.592 --> 01:35:02.225
that hurts your feelings,

01:35:02.227 --> 01:35:03.728
that makes you
feel really bad,

01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:05.830
what you have to do
is straighten that out.

01:35:05.832 --> 01:35:07.665
That ain't no game.
You understand?

01:35:07.667 --> 01:35:10.236
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

01:35:11.503 --> 01:35:12.670
Good morning, there.

01:35:12.672 --> 01:35:14.375
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:35:16.342 --> 01:35:17.774
You bashing me, too?

01:35:17.776 --> 01:35:19.544
Oh, did he say
he wanna be bashed?

01:35:19.546 --> 01:35:21.179
That's exactly what it
sounded like he said to me.

01:35:21.181 --> 01:35:22.147
I know you ain't
walking up on me.

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.148
You better back up
and sit down somewhere, son,

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:25.649
'cause I will knock your...

01:35:25.651 --> 01:35:27.218
"Am I bashing you, too?"

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.120
I'm trying to help
your ignorant ass.

01:35:29.122 --> 01:35:30.591
Oh, yeah?

01:35:31.557 --> 01:35:32.823
I already feel like hell.

01:35:32.825 --> 01:35:33.825
You feel like hell?

01:35:33.827 --> 01:35:35.559
What the hell you think
you done did to her?

01:35:35.561 --> 01:35:37.228
You ought
to feel like dung.

01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:39.066
Dumping this woman out when
she done been good to you.

01:35:40.199 --> 01:35:42.599
Look, baby,
I am so sorry.

01:35:42.601 --> 01:35:44.367
Watch this.
Let me tell you what he gonna say.

01:35:44.369 --> 01:35:45.402
"I don't even know
why I was with her."

01:35:45.404 --> 01:35:48.406
I don't know why I was
with her. I'm... I'm sorry.

01:35:48.408 --> 01:35:50.340
Then he gonna say,
"I'm just tired."

01:35:50.342 --> 01:35:52.577
You know?
I'm just tired.

01:35:52.579 --> 01:35:54.778
Then he gonna say,
"I apologize, baby."

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.179
Baby, you know
I'm sorry.

01:35:56.181 --> 01:35:57.715
"It'll never happen again."

01:35:57.717 --> 01:35:59.383
And I'll never do it again.

01:35:59.385 --> 01:36:01.685
- You the only one for me.
- "You the only one for me."

01:36:01.687 --> 01:36:03.420
- Baby, I love you.
- "Baby, I love you."

01:36:03.422 --> 01:36:05.622
- Baby, I'd be lost without you.
- "I'd be lost without you."

01:36:05.624 --> 01:36:06.691
Boy, let me ask you something.

01:36:06.693 --> 01:36:09.693
You know how many women
done heard this before?

01:36:09.695 --> 01:36:11.461
Cleopatra heard this.

01:36:11.463 --> 01:36:14.232
Harriet Tubman heard it,
Rosa Parks,

01:36:14.234 --> 01:36:15.566
everybody heard this.

01:36:15.568 --> 01:36:16.800
Mary and Martha,

01:36:16.802 --> 01:36:19.136
they all heard
the same lines.

01:36:19.138 --> 01:36:20.470
Son, you wanna be
with this woman?

01:36:20.472 --> 01:36:21.772
Watch, he'll say, "I do."

01:36:21.774 --> 01:36:24.341
- I do.
- Mmm-hmm. I know. Do you love her?

01:36:24.343 --> 01:36:25.576
Yes.

01:36:25.578 --> 01:36:27.310
Then why're you
cheating on me?

01:36:27.312 --> 01:36:29.880
Is there something that I could do?
Do you want me to...

01:36:29.882 --> 01:36:31.415
To be a better person?
Is there...

01:36:31.417 --> 01:36:33.416
No, honey. No. No.

01:36:33.418 --> 01:36:34.484
- Mmm-mmm.
- Did she just say that?

01:36:34.486 --> 01:36:35.585
- She did.
- Yeah, she did.

01:36:35.587 --> 01:36:36.786
No. When he walk up
out of this house,

01:36:36.788 --> 01:36:39.189
he gonna do what he wanna
do, the way he wanna do it.

01:36:39.191 --> 01:36:40.558
That ain't got nothing
to do with you.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.626
Marriage is just a contract
between two people.

01:36:42.628 --> 01:36:43.760
Y'all supposed
to do everything

01:36:43.762 --> 01:36:45.295
in them contract
about them vows.

01:36:45.297 --> 01:36:47.264
If you don't do it,
you broke the deal.

01:36:47.266 --> 01:36:48.566
So he broke the deal.

01:36:48.568 --> 01:36:49.800
So, I don't know why
you would stay with him.

01:36:49.802 --> 01:36:51.368
You need to walk the hell
on up out on him.

01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:52.702
No. Don't tell her that.

01:36:52.704 --> 01:36:54.171
What you mean,
"Don't tell her that"?

01:36:54.173 --> 01:36:55.407
Hell, you broke the deal,
didn't you?

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:57.774
Yeah, but that don't necessarily
mean I want her to go.

01:36:57.776 --> 01:36:59.410
Let me make sure
I understand this.

01:36:59.412 --> 01:37:01.845
So you wanna cheat on her,
you wanna dog her out,

01:37:01.847 --> 01:37:03.613
you wanna talk to her
like she ain't nothing,

01:37:03.615 --> 01:37:04.715
but you don't want her to go.

01:37:04.717 --> 01:37:06.317
Something is wrong
with you, boy.

01:37:06.319 --> 01:37:08.286
Do y'all wanna stay together?

01:37:08.288 --> 01:37:09.353
Yes.

01:37:09.355 --> 01:37:10.520
Do you wanna
try to do better?

01:37:10.522 --> 01:37:11.755
Yes, I swear I'll change.

01:37:11.757 --> 01:37:12.758
You gonna stop lying?

01:37:13.392 --> 01:37:14.392
Yes.

01:37:14.394 --> 01:37:16.393
First thing y'all can do
is get some counseling.

01:37:16.395 --> 01:37:17.661
You need some
separate counseling

01:37:17.663 --> 01:37:18.897
'cause you got anger issues.

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:22.332
And I used to be really angry,
but now I'm so much better.

01:37:22.334 --> 01:37:23.934
The only time I punch
a bitch in the face

01:37:23.936 --> 01:37:25.769
is if she say something
to me I don't like.

01:37:25.771 --> 01:37:27.871
So I'm so much better
than what I was.

01:37:27.873 --> 01:37:29.273
Get some counseling,
all right?

01:37:29.275 --> 01:37:32.278
Then y'all get some counseling
together to work on this marriage.

01:37:33.879 --> 01:37:34.882
Baby.

01:37:35.847 --> 01:37:37.517
I'm so sorry.

01:37:38.851 --> 01:37:39.887
Yeah.

01:37:43.756 --> 01:37:46.459
Until you can learn to
respect me and yourself,

01:37:47.293 --> 01:37:48.595
I gotta go.

01:37:50.462 --> 01:37:52.298
I can't do this anymore.

01:37:53.732 --> 01:37:55.702
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:37:56.535 --> 01:37:57.770
You gonna leave me?

01:37:58.837 --> 01:38:00.273
I'm sorry.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.342
Come on, baby.

01:38:03.243 --> 01:38:04.378
I'm sorry.

01:38:04.843 --> 01:38:06.978
I'm sorry.

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.778
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.348
- Hey.
- Good morning.

01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:11.581
Well, we'll see y'all.

01:38:11.583 --> 01:38:12.750
Has Mama been down?

01:38:12.752 --> 01:38:14.318
No, she hasn't.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.719
How you holding up?

01:38:15.721 --> 01:38:16.821
Not great.

01:38:16.823 --> 01:38:18.255
But I'll be all right.

01:38:18.257 --> 01:38:20.023
Yeah. I know.
It's been a mess.

01:38:20.025 --> 01:38:21.325
I'm so sorry.

01:38:21.327 --> 01:38:22.425
- Hey.
- Good morning.

01:38:22.427 --> 01:38:23.693
- Good morning to you.
- Good morning.

01:38:23.695 --> 01:38:25.563
So good
to see all of y'all.

01:38:25.565 --> 01:38:26.897
Truly, honestly.

01:38:26.899 --> 01:38:28.633
But don't call me
unless somebody die, okay?

01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:30.734
Damn, boy, come back here.
That's your family.

01:38:30.736 --> 01:38:32.502
Jessie!

01:38:32.504 --> 01:38:33.938
You ain't got nothing
to say to me, man.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.709
Just hear him out, okay?

01:38:39.345 --> 01:38:40.644
I'm sorry, man.

01:38:40.646 --> 01:38:42.479
- Yeah.
- Really.

01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:44.014
I was tipsy last night,

01:38:44.016 --> 01:38:46.283
and I didn't really
mean none of that.

01:38:46.285 --> 01:38:47.885
I'm sorry I messed
around with her.

01:38:47.887 --> 01:38:49.687
I'm sorry that
I was lying to you.

01:38:49.689 --> 01:38:52.790
It's coming from the heart, man.
I'm really sorry.

01:38:52.792 --> 01:38:54.692
No, you sorry
you got caught.

01:38:54.694 --> 01:38:56.559
Look, it's really
all I can say.

01:38:56.561 --> 01:38:59.496
Yeah. You right about that.

01:38:59.498 --> 01:39:00.965
That's all you can say.

01:39:00.967 --> 01:39:03.600
Look, son.
You can't choose your family.

01:39:03.602 --> 01:39:04.702
If I could choose my family,

01:39:04.704 --> 01:39:06.069
none of them
would be in my life.

01:39:06.071 --> 01:39:07.772
Family is all you got.

01:39:07.774 --> 01:39:10.541
Even if you can't stand them.
So y'all try to work this out.

01:39:10.543 --> 01:39:12.843
He gonna get some counseling,
he gonna get some help.

01:39:12.845 --> 01:39:14.312
Listen, just keep your women
away from him.

01:39:14.314 --> 01:39:15.712
Don't ever bring
a woman around him.

01:39:15.714 --> 01:39:16.781
Unless she toe-up.

01:39:16.783 --> 01:39:18.948
You wanna really get him,
get you a toe-up woman

01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:20.084
and bring her around him

01:39:20.086 --> 01:39:23.453
and keep your nice, fine,
sexy woman like me hidden.

01:39:23.455 --> 01:39:24.755
Hattie, you bring around.

01:39:24.757 --> 01:39:26.890
But me, you keep hidden,
you understand?

01:39:26.892 --> 01:39:28.492
Tall and sexy.

01:39:28.494 --> 01:39:29.830
At least say bye to Mama.

01:39:31.064 --> 01:39:32.729
Where's she at anyway?

01:39:32.731 --> 01:39:34.564
We're waiting for her
to come down.

01:39:34.566 --> 01:39:37.568
Look, um, I'll make us
some breakfast, okay?

01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:40.770
Girl, hush! Hell, nobody wanna
eat no food right now. We mad.

01:39:40.772 --> 01:39:43.476
Carol. You still here?

01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:45.209
Not for long.

01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:47.044
Look here. I'm glad
he trying to apologize, baby.

01:39:47.046 --> 01:39:48.912
Even if you can't
hear it right now,

01:39:48.914 --> 01:39:50.514
at least you can
take that apology,

01:39:50.516 --> 01:39:51.514
put it somewhere
in your pocket,

01:39:51.516 --> 01:39:53.517
maybe one day
it'll make some sense to you.

01:39:53.519 --> 01:39:56.420
But until then,
may not be nothing you can do.

01:39:56.422 --> 01:39:57.554
'Cause I'mma
tell you right now.

01:39:57.556 --> 01:39:58.622
You're just like your daddy

01:39:58.624 --> 01:40:00.758
and if you don't wanna be
like him, you can change.

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.393
Just 'cause your daddy did it,
don't mean you got to do it, too. Change.

01:40:03.395 --> 01:40:05.830
People be lying to themselves
and lying to God, too.

01:40:05.832 --> 01:40:07.465
Start with you,
working on you.

01:40:07.467 --> 01:40:08.633
Telling the truth to yourself.

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:11.835
I don't wanna be this guy.
I don't wanna be my father.

01:40:11.837 --> 01:40:14.004
Your daddy was something else.
If he was here,

01:40:14.006 --> 01:40:15.639
you know what he probably
be saying right now?

01:40:15.641 --> 01:40:16.643
What?

01:40:19.745 --> 01:40:21.411
- What the hell?
- Wait, what?

01:40:21.413 --> 01:40:23.080
- It's your dad.
- What?

01:40:23.082 --> 01:40:24.715
How the hell
he calling here?

01:40:24.717 --> 01:40:26.517
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

01:40:26.519 --> 01:40:27.785
Mmm-mmm.
He calling from hell.

01:40:27.787 --> 01:40:30.757
- Don't answer that, boy!
- That's God, don't!

01:40:31.623 --> 01:40:33.023
Okay.

01:40:33.025 --> 01:40:33.991
Wait, what happened?

01:40:33.993 --> 01:40:36.460
What'd he say? Did he
say he was in hell?

01:40:36.462 --> 01:40:38.027
You know Mama and Daddy
got the same phone.

01:40:38.029 --> 01:40:39.398
She at the door.

01:40:39.865 --> 01:40:41.032
Oh.

01:40:41.034 --> 01:40:43.134
- Why the hell she ain't knock?
- That what I said.

01:40:43.136 --> 01:40:44.905
I'll be just a second.

01:40:46.538 --> 01:40:48.505
Well, you all still here.

01:40:48.507 --> 01:40:49.639
Who that out there?

01:40:49.641 --> 01:40:51.642
Thought you were gone.

01:40:51.644 --> 01:40:53.978
Since you still here,
y'all gonna get a eyeful.

01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.446
Oh-oh.

01:40:55.448 --> 01:40:58.482
Um, Mama, who is that?

01:40:58.484 --> 01:41:00.885
The man that should've
been your daddy.

01:41:00.887 --> 01:41:02.118
- Ooh.
- Ooh!

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.453
What?

01:41:03.455 --> 01:41:05.022
Mama, where you been?

01:41:05.024 --> 01:41:06.624
I think you call it hoeing.

01:41:06.626 --> 01:41:08.559
Why is he still
sitting out there?

01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:10.827
He is taking me
to Vegas for the weekend.

01:41:10.829 --> 01:41:13.730
Oh, no, Mama.
You are not about to go to Vegas

01:41:13.732 --> 01:41:15.599
with some strange man
you just met.

01:41:15.601 --> 01:41:18.435
I know the pot ain't
talking about the kettle.

01:41:18.437 --> 01:41:19.502
Mama!

01:41:19.504 --> 01:41:20.871
I don't believe
he's no stranger.

01:41:20.873 --> 01:41:23.741
I think they ain't just met last night.

01:41:23.743 --> 01:41:25.443
I believe that's been
going on for a while.

01:41:25.445 --> 01:41:27.914
I just came by
to get my phone.

01:41:29.214 --> 01:41:31.150
And this.

01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:33.617
And what is that?

01:41:33.619 --> 01:41:35.518
It's called a hoe bag.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.620
I know what that is.

01:41:36.622 --> 01:41:37.888
- Toothbrush...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:40.758
...and a little bit of floss and
I'm not talking about the kind

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.626
you put in your teeth.

01:41:42.628 --> 01:41:46.596
It has all the equipment
for an overnight stay.

01:41:46.598 --> 01:41:48.599
Started to take it last night,

01:41:48.601 --> 01:41:50.201
but I didn't wanna
seem desperate.

01:41:50.203 --> 01:41:51.535
Oh. Mama.

01:41:51.537 --> 01:41:52.736
Don't make him
think you a hoe

01:41:52.738 --> 01:41:54.604
until it's time
for you to be one.

01:41:54.606 --> 01:41:56.706
I don't care what
y'all dealing with,

01:41:56.708 --> 01:41:58.576
I don't wanna hear
no more of it.

01:41:58.578 --> 01:42:00.911
Figure it out for yourselves.

01:42:00.913 --> 01:42:02.115
I'll see y'all later.

01:42:03.548 --> 01:42:04.747
Ta-ta!

01:42:04.749 --> 01:42:06.953
Wait, I got to see
who she's with out here!

01:42:07.787 --> 01:42:09.085
Come on, y'all see him.

01:42:09.087 --> 01:42:10.920
- Mama! Ma, come back!
- Let me see what you...

01:42:10.922 --> 01:42:12.956
- Ma! You can't... What?
- Look who she with, girl!

01:42:12.958 --> 01:42:13.957
Vi, where you going?

01:42:13.959 --> 01:42:16.559
Oh, I'm taking you
to Vegas with me tonight.

01:42:16.561 --> 01:42:18.194
All right, baby. Thank you.

01:42:18.196 --> 01:42:20.096
- Mama!
- Where did you meet him?

01:42:20.098 --> 01:42:22.500
He big.

01:42:22.502 --> 01:42:24.100
All right,
y'all have a good time!

01:42:24.102 --> 01:42:26.670
- Uh-huh, we will.
- Don't even worry about her.

01:42:26.672 --> 01:42:29.540
- She's gonna be okay!
- Ta-ta!

01:42:29.542 --> 01:42:30.808
All right, now.

01:42:30.810 --> 01:42:32.510
- Ooh, Vianne!
- See y'all later on!

01:42:32.512 --> 01:42:34.678
Bye, bye!

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:35.612
We'll see y'all later.

01:42:35.614 --> 01:42:36.913
Y'all gotta figure it out
for yourself,

01:42:36.915 --> 01:42:38.682
like your mama said.

01:42:38.684 --> 01:42:39.782
Hold on. Let me tell you something.

01:42:39.784 --> 01:42:41.251
There come
a time in your life

01:42:41.253 --> 01:42:42.987
where the parents have
to do what they gotta do

01:42:42.989 --> 01:42:45.121
and the kids gotta do
what y'all need to do.

01:42:45.123 --> 01:42:47.625
Y'all grown.
Figure this out!

01:42:47.627 --> 01:42:49.026
- Come on, let's go!
- Um...

01:42:49.028 --> 01:42:50.294
You ain't gotta
stay with him there.

01:42:50.296 --> 01:42:51.562
- Bye, y'all.
- Come on,

01:42:51.564 --> 01:42:52.662
I'll show you
how to get a man.

01:42:52.664 --> 01:42:54.801
Mabel, tell me what
that was on that man's face.

01:43:09.882 --> 01:43:11.615
You
and Heathrow brothers?

01:43:11.617 --> 01:43:13.651
And Madea, yeah.
You didn't know that?

01:43:13.653 --> 01:43:14.885
I didn't know he...

01:43:14.887 --> 01:43:17.121
That's my brother.
Your ignorant ass didn't know that?

01:43:17.123 --> 01:43:19.023
- No!
- Did you read the damn script?

01:43:19.025 --> 01:43:20.624
Yeah, I read it.

01:43:20.626 --> 01:43:23.596
How you gonna take away
a man's ability to make sound?

01:43:31.971 --> 01:43:34.772
Damn, it, Ma,
I'm gonna you up!

01:43:40.745 --> 01:43:42.078
Why you trying
to flex with your arm?

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.746
Put the bag down.

01:43:43.748 --> 01:43:45.081
No. Hold them.
But just...

01:43:45.083 --> 01:43:46.750
Why you trying
to hold them like that?

01:43:46.752 --> 01:43:48.852
- He can't help it.
- Let it hang to your side.

01:43:48.854 --> 01:43:49.952
- There you go.
- Okay.

01:43:49.954 --> 01:43:52.689
Let's try it one more time.
He over here flexing.

01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.794
I got my bags.

01:43:56.796 --> 01:43:58.094
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:43:58.096 --> 01:43:59.162
Good morning.

01:43:59.164 --> 01:44:00.800
Well, we'll see y'all.

01:44:03.101 --> 01:44:04.902
Try it one more time.

01:44:04.904 --> 01:44:07.170
Just leave 'em down
at your side.

01:44:07.172 --> 01:44:08.574
See my muscle?

01:44:09.275 --> 01:44:11.908
Lean over some more.

01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:13.676
If you hit me
with this big-ass hand,

01:44:13.678 --> 01:44:16.013
I'm telling you right now,
it's gonna be me and you.

01:44:16.015 --> 01:44:17.648
Cassi came...
This is serious. Cassi came

01:44:17.650 --> 01:44:19.950
to my mama's funeral,
sitting up in the choir stand.

01:44:19.952 --> 01:44:21.018
Oh, my God!

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.652
Drinking straight-up Hennessy.

01:44:22.654 --> 01:44:25.054
Sitting there at the funeral
just getting tore down.

01:44:25.056 --> 01:44:27.323
Tyler, that is a lie!

01:44:27.325 --> 01:44:28.259
