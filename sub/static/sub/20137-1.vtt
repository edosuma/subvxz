00:23.798 --> 00:27.098
Careful with that.
Lift with your legs. Your legs.

00:27.302 --> 00:30.397
Did you wipe your feet
before you came in? I'm talking to you.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.314
Huh?

00:41.733 --> 00:43.485
Disgusting.

00:43.693 --> 00:47.618
The garbage in this trash can is filthy.
I want this garbage cleaned at once.

00:47.822 --> 00:48.994
Hello.

00:49.198 --> 00:50.791
Is anyone listening to me?

00:50.992 --> 00:54.462
Am I the only one here
who cares about cleanliness?

01:01.669 --> 01:03.421
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:23.650 --> 01:26.153
The Phantom.

01:37.038 --> 01:40.212
Did you know Chicago is
the third largest city in the U.S.?

01:40.416 --> 01:44.922
- Like, I know it has the best pizza.
- Yeah, pizza.

01:46.547 --> 01:49.426
Did you know Chicago
has almost 200 art galleries?

01:49.634 --> 01:52.353
You really have no idea
where my interests lie, do you?

01:52.553 --> 01:56.103
I still can't believe we're really
finalists on Talent Star. Aah!

01:56.307 --> 01:58.355
- Have I mentioned it's my favorite show?
- Once or twice.

01:58.559 --> 02:00.436
- In this breath.
- Well, it is.

02:00.645 --> 02:04.821
And Brick Pimiento is the greatest
host ever. Ooh. There he is.

02:05.024 --> 02:06.742
I'm so excited.

02:08.945 --> 02:12.916
I really didn't think we were gonna make it
through that last round of eliminations.

02:13.116 --> 02:17.087
Oh, come on, Daph, we had it sewn up.
You know singers have the advantage.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.174
Hey, that's not the
song we're doing.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.595
This is a little something
I wrote myself.

02:28.631 --> 02:31.305
- Like, that's catchy.
- Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road.

02:31.509 --> 02:32.556
Right.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.311
Fred, that's beautiful.
I really like you.

02:37.515 --> 02:42.771
It. I like it. Not you. I mean, I like
you but... Heh, I, uh, like your song.

02:42.978 --> 02:44.104
Thanks.

02:44.312 --> 02:48.033
You guys are good, but me and Scooby
are gonna beat you. Right, Scoob?

02:48.233 --> 02:49.325
You betcha.

02:49.484 --> 02:51.452
Uh, you're not in the competition.

02:51.653 --> 02:55.032
We will be, once Brick sees
our amazing juggling act.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.538
You can't just audition
the day before the finals.

02:57.743 --> 02:59.461
Like, you can, if you're awesome.

02:59.661 --> 03:02.505
Okay, we definitely wanna hit
the Field Museum.

03:02.706 --> 03:04.208
There's a Picasso exhibit.

03:04.374 --> 03:10.472
Oh, oh! The Mineralogical Society has the
world-famous soap diamond on display.

03:14.801 --> 03:18.522
Does it say anything in those books about
that Opera House where we're shooting?

03:18.722 --> 03:20.349
Yeah.
It's almost a hundred years old.

03:20.515 --> 03:22.188
It's been closed since the '70s.

03:22.392 --> 03:24.394
And there are rumors
that it's haunted.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.151
Of course it's haunted.

03:27.355 --> 03:30.029
Like, when do we ever go to a place
that is not haunted?

03:30.233 --> 03:31.610
Wait, who's driving?

03:31.777 --> 03:33.700
Uh, green means go, right?

03:33.904 --> 03:38.080
- Shaggy.
- Scooby-dooby-doo, heh.

05:54.836 --> 05:59.137
This place is amazing. I can't believe
it's been closed for so long.

05:59.758 --> 06:02.887
I'm sorry, sir. No animals allowed
except seeing-eye dogs.

06:03.094 --> 06:06.815
Fine. You guys, go ahead,
we'll catch up with you.

06:07.015 --> 06:08.483
No, they won't.

06:08.683 --> 06:11.277
Okay, we'll, uh, see you later.

06:20.820 --> 06:23.323
We're supposed to check in
with the assistant director?

06:23.531 --> 06:27.627
Dewey? Heh, yeah, good luck with that.
He's in there.

06:37.879 --> 06:39.506
What? Where? What happened?

06:39.714 --> 06:42.308
- You know, that guy.
- The Phantom.

06:45.929 --> 06:48.352
- Hello, we're supposed to check in.
- Yeah, I know.

06:48.556 --> 06:50.775
But you're gonna have to wait.

06:50.976 --> 06:54.105
What? Where? The Phantom. Ugh.

06:54.312 --> 06:56.735
- The Phantom?
- Unh, he keeps doing that.

06:56.940 --> 07:00.365
You know, overuse of smelling salts
can damage the nasal passages.

07:00.568 --> 07:01.615
- His or mine?
- His.

07:05.991 --> 07:08.414
The Phantom!

07:09.869 --> 07:11.496
Hey, I found that clipboard
the Phantom took.

07:11.705 --> 07:13.127
And also I quit.

07:13.331 --> 07:17.552
I ain't hanging around this place
for another second. It's haunted.

07:21.256 --> 07:23.099
“Christine must win"?

07:23.299 --> 07:27.304
Well, gang, it looks like we've got
another mystery on our hands.

07:33.101 --> 07:36.981
- Hold it right there.
- Hey, like, it's just a bass, man.

07:37.188 --> 07:38.986
Sure it is.

07:40.900 --> 07:46.157
- Oh, uh, well, go on in then.
- Thank you.

07:48.158 --> 07:51.913
Chrissy does not give interviews unless
she can approve all questions in advance.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.170
She will accept no questions regarding
politics, religion or her favorite color.

07:56.374 --> 07:57.546
Because I said so.

07:58.168 --> 08:01.547
- Well, hello there. Are you--?
- Are you trying to psych her out?

08:01.755 --> 08:04.634
- Is this some kind of mind game?
- I was just saying hi.

08:04.841 --> 08:07.560
- Well, don't.
- You can't just talk to Chrissy.

08:07.761 --> 08:10.514
She's very sensitive.
You have to talk to her...

08:10.722 --> 08:14.101
...before you talk to her to let her
know you're going to talk to her.

08:14.309 --> 08:16.311
- Isn't that right, sweetie?
- Whatever.

08:16.770 --> 08:17.817
You see?

08:19.939 --> 08:22.738
- Yeah, hi. We're here to check in.
- We're checking in!

08:22.942 --> 08:25.195
Uh, Mr. Ottoman's kind of
unconscious right now?

08:25.403 --> 08:28.282
- Are you saying we can't check in?
- They're saying we can't check in.

08:28.490 --> 08:30.584
- This is totally unacceptable.
- Uh...

08:30.742 --> 08:31.959
She said, "Uh."

08:32.159 --> 08:34.162
They're pretty much
like that all the time.

08:34.370 --> 08:38.796
- Hey, heh. You're Emma, right? The Violinist?
- Yeah. And you're Fred and Daphne.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.344
I saw your audition tape,
you guys were great.

08:41.544 --> 08:43.342
And I'm not just saying
that because of the cameras.

08:43.546 --> 08:45.640
- What cameras?
- Those cameras.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.263
You know, they're catching
all the backstage drama.

08:51.513 --> 08:55.643
That's the best part of the show.
All the who likes who, who hates who stuff.

08:55.850 --> 08:58.273
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to Talent Star.

08:58.478 --> 09:00.151
Hey, I'm your host,
Brick Pimiento.

09:00.355 --> 09:04.155
I just wanted to reassure you all that
everything is fantastic, just fantastic.

09:04.359 --> 09:07.078
There isn't a problem, nothing happened
and there's definitely no ghost.

09:07.278 --> 09:09.372
- Ghost?
- Ghost? I didn't say ghost.

09:09.572 --> 09:12.621
Why would I say ghost
when there's no ghost, heh? Fantastic.

09:14.369 --> 09:17.714
- There he is.
- Yeah, there he is.

09:18.623 --> 09:20.796
You're okay there,
right, Dewey, heh?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.254
Fantastic. Well, carry on.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.438
I smell dog.

09:35.682 --> 09:37.150
Uh, Mr. Ottoman,
are you all right?

09:37.350 --> 09:40.354
Dogs are nothing but big furry sacks
of germs. Did you know that?

09:40.562 --> 09:42.815
- I don't think that--
- I'm going to find that dog...

09:43.022 --> 09:46.071
...if it takes me all night.
Give me that.

09:47.694 --> 09:51.244
Mr. Pimiento. Mr. Pimiento!

09:51.447 --> 09:56.078
Can we have two minutes of your time?
We've got an act that's just terrific.

09:56.286 --> 09:57.458
Yeah, terrific.

09:57.662 --> 10:02.338
My friends, I've built my career
on two deeply held beliefs.

10:02.542 --> 10:06.388
One, all talent deserves
a chance to be seen.

10:06.588 --> 10:09.137
And two, juggling stinks.

10:12.177 --> 10:13.975
So, what have you got for me?

10:26.565 --> 10:28.533
Terrible. That was just...

10:31.653 --> 10:35.032
Aah! I don't know what that was
but I'm running away from it.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.708
Me too.

10:41.788 --> 10:42.835
Is it him?

10:45.876 --> 10:47.503
- Yeah, it's the Phantom.
- The Phantom?

10:47.711 --> 10:50.260
- What are they doing--?
- There.

10:50.464 --> 10:52.933
Now he's there.

10:53.133 --> 10:55.682
Velma, you watch the monitors.
You can tell me where he is.

10:55.886 --> 10:57.934
- Daphne, you come with--
- Yes.

11:07.439 --> 11:10.568
<i>- Which way?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.</i>

11:10.776 --> 11:12.073
Second door on your left.

11:12.277 --> 11:15.247
- Are you getting all this on camera?
- Yeah, this is great stuff.

11:15.447 --> 11:19.998
Fantastic. Should we use it for
promos or leak it to Whotube?

11:20.202 --> 11:22.921
- Both.
- Hmm.

11:44.726 --> 11:46.694
Look out!

11:49.189 --> 11:51.112
Are you okay?

11:52.859 --> 11:54.827
- Velma, which way?
- I don't know.

11:55.028 --> 11:56.450
I can't see where he went.

11:58.031 --> 12:00.125
In here.

12:04.538 --> 12:07.382
- He'll never think to look in here, right?
- Right.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.172
I smell lemons.

12:11.545 --> 12:13.673
Yeah, I smell lemons too.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.133
Do you smell lemons?

12:20.429 --> 12:21.726
There.
He's heading north.

12:21.930 --> 12:24.399
<i>- North, which way is that?
- Go left.</i>

12:24.599 --> 12:25.851
<i>No, right.
Then left.</i>

12:27.686 --> 12:29.359
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

12:29.563 --> 12:31.816
- I didn't mean to...
- Go.

12:32.024 --> 12:34.026
He's on the stairs.

12:37.654 --> 12:39.873
What?
Did you see that?

12:40.449 --> 12:43.373
Maybe he really is a ghost.

12:46.747 --> 12:48.294
How could he just disappear?

12:48.498 --> 12:51.468
- There must be a rational explanation.
- Yeah, like he's a ghost.

12:52.836 --> 12:55.965
A ghost who smells like lemons?
That sounds kind of weird.

12:56.173 --> 12:59.302
And it's not weird to have a ghost
who doesn't smell like lemons?

12:59.509 --> 13:01.056
We have to get to
the bottom of this.

13:04.139 --> 13:05.766
Dog.

13:07.225 --> 13:08.568
Dog, where?

13:08.769 --> 13:12.069
Get that germ sack out of here.
Right now.

13:12.272 --> 13:14.616
Did he leave footprints?
I think I see footprints.

13:14.816 --> 13:16.534
He didn't touch any walls, did he?

13:16.735 --> 13:21.206
Oh, my gosh. Now I'll have to sanitize
the entire building.

13:21.406 --> 13:23.374
Good thing I brought bleach.

13:23.575 --> 13:25.703
Out, I said. Out, out, out.

13:25.911 --> 13:27.379
Come on, guys.

13:27.579 --> 13:31.004
I want this floor buffed.
And I want it polished.

13:32.584 --> 13:35.713
Okay, I'll check us in to the hotel
and do some Internet research.

13:35.879 --> 13:38.507
Shaggy and Scooby,
you go to the library on State Street...

13:38.715 --> 13:40.968
...and see what you can find out
about the Opera House's history.

13:41.176 --> 13:43.270
How are we the choice
for library research?

13:43.470 --> 13:46.314
I'll see what I can find out in the building.
Daphne, you come with--

13:46.515 --> 13:48.392
Yes.

13:48.767 --> 13:50.986
- I'm going with Fred, heh.
- Ah.

14:04.866 --> 14:07.995
Welcome to the Hotel Canard.
How may I be of service?

14:08.203 --> 14:11.707
- Hello, I need to check--
- Hi, checking in. Barb and Lance Damon.

14:11.915 --> 14:15.715
- And Chrissy.
- I'm sorry, this young lady was--

14:15.919 --> 14:19.298
- Hey, are you giving us attitude?
- I think he's giving us attitude.

14:19.506 --> 14:23.636
Listen, buddy, I want someone
to take Chrissy's bags to the room now.

14:25.846 --> 14:26.972
Go ahead, I'll wait.

14:27.889 --> 14:28.981
Humph.

14:30.642 --> 14:32.394
Oh, Chrissy.
Are you okay?

14:32.602 --> 14:35.572
Of course, I'm okay.
Why wouldn't I be okay?

14:35.772 --> 14:38.525
Weren't you scared of the Phantom?
You were screaming--

14:40.152 --> 14:42.280
That wasn't a scared
scream, stupid.

14:42.487 --> 14:45.991
It was a happy scream because he told me
I'm gonna win the competition.

14:46.199 --> 14:47.917
- He told you--
- I'm gonna win.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.997
Even if he has to obliterate
all the other contestants.

14:51.163 --> 14:53.507
- Isn't that awesome? Heh.
Uh--

14:53.665 --> 14:56.885
It's true. We have a genuine psycho
on our side. Score.

14:57.085 --> 15:00.510
And that's why the Phantom wrote,
“Christine must win" on that clipboard.

15:00.714 --> 15:02.808
- Her name's Christine.
- But call her Chrissy.

15:03.008 --> 15:05.761
Only don't call her Chrissy
because don't talk to her.

15:05.969 --> 15:09.599
- You're getting nerd breath all over her.
- Come on, Chrissy. Keep smiling.

15:12.225 --> 15:14.944
- Oh, they're unbearable, aren't they?
- Yeah.

15:15.145 --> 15:19.992
- Who are you?
- I am The Great Pauldini.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.944
- My card.
- Uh, that's an egg.

15:25.113 --> 15:29.038
Okay, egg, card, whatever.
I made it appear, right?

15:29.242 --> 15:33.372
Can you do that? No, you can't
because you're not a magician, heh.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.332
- Who's a magician?
- You are?

15:35.540 --> 15:37.884
Oh, yeah, heh. Up high.

15:38.084 --> 15:40.633
That's what I'm talking about.

15:40.837 --> 15:44.341
- He's pretty unbearable himself.
- Tell me about... Hello?

15:47.427 --> 15:49.304
Waldo. The ventriloquist.

15:49.513 --> 15:52.016
And here's Hufnagel,
my dummy.

15:52.224 --> 15:55.353
- Hiya, toots.
- And I sit on his lap.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.359
It's funny. Not at all demeaning.
Right?

15:58.563 --> 16:01.191
- Right.
- Right. Catch you later.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.365
Oh, my gosh, he is adorable.

16:04.569 --> 16:08.449
I am not adorable. I am hot.

16:08.657 --> 16:11.752
- You know, what? He kind of is.
- Totally.

16:11.952 --> 16:13.044
Um, I saw him first.

16:13.245 --> 16:15.964
- Hey, you guys are that band, right?
- Yes.

16:16.164 --> 16:19.168
We are Girlasaurus Rex.

16:22.337 --> 16:24.214
Oh, my gosh, we are so metal, heh.

16:24.422 --> 16:28.268
Cathy. It's so not metal to say,
“Oh, my gosh, we're so metal."

16:28.468 --> 16:29.811
Right. Sorry.

16:30.011 --> 16:32.184
We were a country act
until three months ago.

16:32.389 --> 16:34.483
We agreed we weren't
telling people that.

16:34.683 --> 16:37.607
Now, come on, look surly.

16:39.980 --> 16:44.952
I think a lemon-scented ghost
would fit right in with this crowd.

16:50.824 --> 16:54.169
Fred, why do ghosts and monsters
and stuff turn up wherever we go?

16:54.369 --> 16:56.918
- Is it something about us?
- No, this happens to everyone.

16:57.122 --> 16:59.295
- What?
- It would be too much of a coincidence...

16:59.499 --> 17:00.546
...if this only happened to us.

17:00.750 --> 17:04.095
So logically everyone must run
into ghosts and monsters all the time.

17:04.296 --> 17:06.219
- Really?
- Sure, it's simple math.

17:06.423 --> 17:07.925
They must be everywhere.

17:15.265 --> 17:17.939
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

17:18.101 --> 17:21.901
I'm Mel Richmond. I own this building
and I have a right to lurk in it.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.284
- You must be from the show, right?
- Yeah, we're contestants.

17:26.483 --> 17:30.034
Right. Well, uh, good luck to you.
You make a cute couple.

17:30.238 --> 17:32.661
We're not a cute couple.
I mean, heh, we're not a couple...

17:32.866 --> 17:35.995
...so we can't be a cute one, although
we would be if we were. Which we're not.

17:37.370 --> 17:41.170
I mean, it's not that we don't like each
other, we just don't "like" like each other.

17:41.374 --> 17:44.799
It's not likely. Right, Fred?
Or do we?

17:45.003 --> 17:47.973
We don't, right? Do we?
Why are we talking about this so much?

17:48.173 --> 17:51.222
Can we change the subject now, please?
This is none of your business.

17:51.384 --> 17:53.933
Uh, Mr. Richmond, do you know
anything about the Phantom?

17:54.095 --> 17:58.225
Argh, that business again.
Look, that was all way before my time.

17:58.433 --> 18:02.563
I inherited this place a few years ago
when my father passed away.

18:02.771 --> 18:04.192
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:04.396 --> 18:07.070
Me too, it's costing me thousands
of dollars a week.

18:07.274 --> 18:08.617
I can't do anything with it.

18:08.817 --> 18:13.163
People are still spooked by that Phantom
nonsense and that was 35 years ago.

18:13.364 --> 18:14.707
What was 35 years ago?

18:14.865 --> 18:18.165
Uh, it happened back in the '70s.

18:18.744 --> 18:23.671
<i>Before that there had been some oddities.
But, you know, nothing scary.</i>

18:23.874 --> 18:28.004
<i>But when my father turned the place
into a disco, all heck broke loose.</i>

18:28.212 --> 18:32.513
<i>The Phantom wreaked havoc every night.
People thought it was part of the show.</i>

18:36.804 --> 18:39.182
<i>Despite the Phantom,
the club flourished.</i>

18:39.390 --> 18:41.484
<i>Customers looked
forward to seeing him.</i>

18:41.684 --> 18:45.530
<i>Even though it was said his mask
hid a terrible deformity.</i>

18:48.941 --> 18:50.659
<i>No one was ever really hurt.</i>

18:50.859 --> 18:54.614
<i>But then the Phantom became
more destructive.</i>

18:55.906 --> 18:58.455
<i>He even set fires.</i>

18:59.326 --> 19:04.628
<i>Then one night.
He destroyed the disco ball.</i>

19:08.961 --> 19:11.134
<i>After that,
no one came back.</i>

19:11.672 --> 19:14.050
<i>Finally, my father had to close
the place down.</i>

19:15.634 --> 19:19.605
I hadn't been able to rent it at all until
the Talent Star people came around.

19:19.805 --> 19:22.103
Now they say the Phantom's back.

19:22.307 --> 19:25.436
Well, maybe I'll get lucky
and he'll burn the place down...

19:25.644 --> 19:27.863
...so I can collect the
insurance money, eh? Heh, heh.

19:28.063 --> 19:32.534
Or maybe I should put on a cape and mask
and do it myself, ha, ha.

19:35.237 --> 19:38.081
What? Ah, now,
don't look at me like that.

19:38.282 --> 19:41.877
You see, that's why
I don't make jokes.

19:51.378 --> 19:54.006
Know what I like best
about going to the library, Scoob?

19:54.173 --> 19:55.595
- The books?
- Nope.

19:55.758 --> 19:58.477
The fact that it's far, far away
from that Phantom guy.

19:58.677 --> 19:59.894
You said it.

20:00.095 --> 20:04.566
And it's nice that Velma trusts us
with such an important assignment like--

20:09.396 --> 20:10.864
Pizza.

20:17.112 --> 20:18.204
Give me eat.

20:18.405 --> 20:20.954
Right this way, sir.

20:27.581 --> 20:30.960
Do you have anything bigger
than the extra-extra-large?

20:31.168 --> 20:32.715
Yeah, but it's not on the menu.

20:32.920 --> 20:37.050
Oh, and you have to sign a release
saying we're not responsible if you die.

20:37.257 --> 20:38.884
- We'll take it.
- All righty.

20:39.051 --> 20:41.099
But I'll have to move you
to another table.

20:41.303 --> 20:42.350
Why?

20:42.554 --> 20:44.556
Because this one
is smaller than your pizza.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.188
Awesome.

21:07.746 --> 21:10.340
Aah! Mm!

21:24.513 --> 21:27.983
If you don't mind,
we'd like to be alone with the pizza.

21:28.183 --> 21:29.480
Okey-dokey.

21:29.643 --> 21:31.896
Uh, we can wrap up the
leftovers for you.

21:32.104 --> 21:34.323
Leftovers?

22:07.806 --> 22:11.527
I'd just like to say that it's
an honor to be in your presence.

22:11.727 --> 22:13.775
Like, I'm sure it is.

22:26.116 --> 22:29.871
I love you, Lotte.
Lotte! I love you.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.249
Thank you.

22:35.959 --> 22:37.836
- Who's that?
- That's Lotte.

22:38.045 --> 22:41.515
She's on Talent Star, and she's already
won a bunch of other talent shows.

22:41.715 --> 22:45.015
<i>She was great on
America's Got Singing...</i>

22:45.218 --> 22:49.268
<i>...and Sing or Die
and Singetty-Sing-Song-Sing.</i>

22:57.064 --> 22:58.111
Mm-mm.

22:58.273 --> 23:03.951
I do not sign for anyone wearing
tights and shorts. Because it's wrong.

23:06.823 --> 23:09.667
Yeah, yeah, you better run.

23:11.244 --> 23:13.246
Leave us.

23:18.919 --> 23:22.298
I want you to take a message
to Daphne and Fred.

23:22.506 --> 23:27.637
Tell them they don't stand a chance.
I will crush all who oppose me.

23:27.844 --> 23:29.938
I will feast upon their blood.

23:30.138 --> 23:34.018
Their families will weep
over their smoldering corpses.

23:34.226 --> 23:37.651
I will leave nothing
but their scarves.

23:37.854 --> 23:40.073
So swears Lotte.

23:40.273 --> 23:44.824
L-O-T-T...

23:47.990 --> 23:49.287
...E!

23:49.491 --> 23:50.663
Lotte.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.917
Keep the change.

24:11.263 --> 24:12.810
- Hey, guys.
- Where have you been?

24:13.015 --> 24:15.564
- The library closed hours ago.
- The what?

24:16.393 --> 24:18.862
Never mind, I found plenty
of information online.

24:19.062 --> 24:21.406
There was definitely
a Phantom back in the '70s.

24:21.606 --> 24:23.950
I don't think the one we saw
was the same person.

24:24.151 --> 24:26.028
This is from earlier tonight.

24:26.236 --> 24:29.240
- Where did you get that picture?
- It's all over the Internet.

24:29.448 --> 24:31.871
Talent Starts really milking this
for publicity.

24:32.826 --> 24:35.670
See?
The outfit is different.

24:35.871 --> 24:40.092
What we saw today was someone taking
advantage of the old stories for their own.

24:40.292 --> 24:43.341
But you saw him disappear, right?
He must be a real ghost.

24:43.545 --> 24:46.424
I saw it on a monitor.
it could have been faked.

24:46.631 --> 24:49.851
- So who are the likely suspects?
- Definitely Chrissy's parents.

24:50.052 --> 24:51.099
You're right.

24:51.303 --> 24:54.352
The Phantom seems interested in making
sure Chrissy wins the competition.

24:54.556 --> 24:56.058
And Brick Pimiento.

24:56.266 --> 24:59.566
He was a little too quick to capitalize
on the Phantom for publicity.

24:59.770 --> 25:02.694
Could he be doing this
to boost the show's ratings?

25:02.898 --> 25:05.651
What about Mel Richmond,
the guy who owns the Opera house?

25:07.527 --> 25:09.575
Maybe what he said
about insurance money wasn't a joke.

25:09.780 --> 25:12.283
What about Dewey Ottoman?
He's creepy.

25:12.491 --> 25:14.914
- Does he have a motive?
- Isn't creepy a motive?

25:20.040 --> 25:22.668
Ooh, ooh!
You gotta put Lotte down.

25:22.876 --> 25:24.423
You think Lotte
is the Phantom?

25:24.628 --> 25:28.178
I think she's scarier
than the Phantom, heh. Put her down.

25:30.884 --> 25:34.764
Hmm. Everyone on this list but Mel
Richmond and Lotte have been seen...

25:34.971 --> 25:36.894
...at the same time
as the Phantom.

25:39.184 --> 25:40.310
Guys, it's getting late.

25:40.519 --> 25:42.066
We have the dress rehearsal
in the morning...

25:42.270 --> 25:44.022
...and the big show
tomorrow night.

25:44.231 --> 25:46.073
I say we get some sleep.

25:47.399 --> 25:50.073
Sure thing,
Mr. Jones.

25:52.154 --> 25:53.827
I will break you.

25:57.618 --> 26:02.374
We have adjoining rooms, Shaggy.
You can go this way.

26:04.750 --> 26:05.876
See you in the morning.

26:07.419 --> 26:08.796
He said he'll see me.

26:09.547 --> 26:11.049
- Hmm.
- Ugh.

26:16.554 --> 26:17.771
Huh?

26:22.810 --> 26:24.653
Daph?

26:32.695 --> 26:34.697
- Trouble sleeping?
- Ah, yeah.

26:34.905 --> 26:37.875
- Are you okay? What's wrong?
- I'm fine.

26:38.075 --> 26:41.670
You're obviously not fine, Daphne.
Why don't you tell me about it?

26:41.871 --> 26:45.796
I'm in love with Fred.
There, I said it.

26:47.084 --> 26:49.507
Really?
Wow, I never would have...

26:49.712 --> 26:51.464
Gosh, that's a shocker.

26:51.672 --> 26:55.393
I've kept it a secret for so long.
I just had to tell someone.

26:55.593 --> 26:58.813
Shouldn't you be telling someone else?
Like, maybe Fred?

26:59.013 --> 27:01.391
Oh, no.
Oh, my gosh, no.

27:01.599 --> 27:04.148
I was hoping this competition
would bring us closer...

27:04.351 --> 27:07.525
...but even after all the time
rehearsing and performing together...

27:07.730 --> 27:09.323
...I just can't say anything.

27:09.857 --> 27:12.531
I even wrote a song,
to that tune Fred composed.

27:12.735 --> 27:14.282
It explains how I feel about him.

27:14.486 --> 27:17.660
But if I think about singing it
I feel like I'm going to throw up...

27:17.865 --> 27:20.618
...or pass out or both.

27:21.035 --> 27:22.332
You have to tell him, Daph.

27:22.536 --> 27:24.664
You'll never know how he feels
unless you talk to him.

27:24.872 --> 27:28.672
I can't. Maybe if I win Talent Star,
that would give me the confidence.

27:28.876 --> 27:30.503
Maybe then I could talk to him.

27:31.128 --> 27:34.803
Velma, we have to win.
We just have to.

27:55.027 --> 27:58.497
Scooby-doo, you awake?
I can't sleep.

27:58.697 --> 28:00.699
Me neither.

28:00.908 --> 28:02.535
You want the bed?

28:02.743 --> 28:07.499
No. It's been almost two hours since we
had that pizza and I'm starving, heh.

28:07.706 --> 28:10.209
Maybe the hotel has
a vending machine or something.

29:01.635 --> 29:02.932
Dog!

29:05.264 --> 29:07.358
I touched a dog.

29:07.558 --> 29:10.311
I have dog bacteria.

29:28.662 --> 29:31.916
- Like, take it easy there, Phantom dude.
- Yeah.

29:36.795 --> 29:40.425
That's not taking it easy.
That's taking it very, very hard.

30:44.488 --> 30:45.535
It's been cut.

30:45.739 --> 30:50.165
It's okay, everyone. He's gone. No harm
done. Heh, everybody back to bed.

30:50.369 --> 30:51.416
Fantastic.

30:51.620 --> 30:54.169
This Phantom's gonna
get us a 40 share.

30:55.707 --> 30:58.176
Enough with the screaming.

30:58.377 --> 31:03.975
Gonna skin you alive. Good night.

31:05.384 --> 31:08.103
- Hey, no lemons.
- Yeah, you're right.

31:12.558 --> 31:15.061
A little baking soda
and water will get that out.

31:15.269 --> 31:17.738
- I'm sure the hotel staff will--
- No, no, no, please.

31:17.938 --> 31:20.487
I should get 45 minutes
of scrubbing out of this.

31:20.691 --> 31:23.444
That smoke bomb seemed like
something a magician would do...

31:23.652 --> 31:25.575
...and The Great Pauldini's
nowhere to be seen.

31:25.779 --> 31:27.406
True.
But does he have a motive?

31:27.614 --> 31:30.333
This just keeps
getting more and more mysterious.

31:30.534 --> 31:32.332
You know what the
real mystery is?

31:32.536 --> 31:35.540
How did you get hold of a net so fast
in the middle of the night?

31:35.747 --> 31:39.172
- Um, well, I...
- You sleep with a net, don't you?

31:39.376 --> 31:41.925
Lots of people do.

31:56.226 --> 31:58.320
Aw, look at the little...

31:59.146 --> 32:02.320
- ... baby?
- Gooby-gooby-goo

32:09.948 --> 32:11.621
Okay, people.

32:11.825 --> 32:14.749
We've only got one dress rehearsal,
so let's get it right.

32:14.953 --> 32:17.672
Chrissy Damon,
you're up first.

32:24.421 --> 32:26.344
- Chrissy.
- Ready.

33:40.288 --> 33:41.585
Hmm.

33:50.548 --> 33:54.724
For a girl her age, that song seems
a little incredibly inappropriate.

33:54.927 --> 33:57.180
- Yeah.
- Very incredibly.

34:02.059 --> 34:04.528
Next is Emma Gale.

34:04.729 --> 34:07.983
Has anyone cleaned
this microphone recently?

34:08.190 --> 34:12.786
- Like an hour ago?
- Unbelievable. Are we savages?

34:40.056 --> 34:43.856
Oh, my gosh, she is amazing.
Are you Emma's parents?

34:44.060 --> 34:48.110
Hey, Mike and Meg Gale, pleased
to meet you. Boy, isn't she terrific?

34:48.313 --> 34:50.442
I think she's got a good
shot at winning.

34:50.650 --> 34:51.902
Well, we sure hope so.

34:52.109 --> 34:55.158
Without that prize money
the bank's going to take our farm.

34:55.362 --> 34:57.832
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Yeah.

34:58.032 --> 35:03.289
It's been in our family for five generations.
Mike's grandparents are buried there.

35:05.956 --> 35:08.880
So, uh, what are you two gonna do
with the money if you win?

35:09.043 --> 35:11.842
Uh, just nothing really, just...
I don't know.

35:12.004 --> 35:15.850
Um, could use some new seat covers
for the van.

35:16.008 --> 35:19.353
Um, possibly a hat.

35:21.555 --> 35:24.479
- Hey there.
- Fantastic, heh.

35:24.684 --> 35:26.903
I know we were
a little unprepared before...

35:27.103 --> 35:29.697
...but now we have
got the act for you.

35:29.897 --> 35:31.069
Yeah.

35:32.191 --> 35:34.819
We are, hold for it...

35:35.027 --> 35:36.745
...contortionists.

35:37.488 --> 35:38.785
Ta-da.

35:38.948 --> 35:41.792
All right, well,
let's see what you got.

35:48.958 --> 35:52.838
You might wanna go help your friends. They've
gotten themselves a little tangled, heh.

35:53.045 --> 35:55.173
Fantastic.

35:55.381 --> 35:59.682
We need aspirin,
a chiropractor and some baby oil.

35:59.885 --> 36:01.512
Right now.

36:02.221 --> 36:04.064
Okay.

36:05.099 --> 36:07.397
Next up, Lotte Lavoie.

36:07.601 --> 36:11.322
All right, all right. Throat spray.

36:38.424 --> 36:40.768
Who did this to me? Who?

36:40.968 --> 36:46.520
Someone is going to pay for this.
Someone is going to pay!

36:46.724 --> 36:49.728
Her throat has been sprayed
with some kind of chemical irritant.

36:49.935 --> 36:53.189
There's no permanent damage, but you
won't be able to sing for a week.

36:53.397 --> 36:56.367
I'm gonna sue you. And you.

36:56.525 --> 36:59.404
And you.
And everyone!

36:59.612 --> 37:05.836
Somebody had better fix this
or I am going to get mad!

37:07.161 --> 37:09.664
So do you think maybe
the Phantom is behind this?

37:09.830 --> 37:11.548
Hmm. It could be.

37:11.749 --> 37:15.424
We're behind schedule, people.
Next up are Blake and Jones.

37:15.628 --> 37:17.926
Okay, we'll keep an eye open
for the Phantom.

37:18.631 --> 37:20.474
Don't worry about a thing.

38:17.731 --> 38:20.530
- You guys were great.
- Thanks.

38:20.734 --> 38:22.407
Sorry, sir. So sorry.

38:22.611 --> 38:25.660
Was that your new act?
What are you, the human cannonball?

38:27.032 --> 38:28.909
No, we thought you
were the Phantom.

38:29.118 --> 38:32.213
What? Why would you think that?
That's crazy.

38:33.664 --> 38:34.711
Ah.

38:37.418 --> 38:38.715
The Great Pauldini.

38:53.726 --> 38:55.194
Still no sign of the Phantom.

38:55.394 --> 38:57.021
Maybe the whole thing's over.

38:57.229 --> 38:58.947
Waldo and Hufnagel?

39:00.232 --> 39:03.327
Say, Hufnagel,
are you an actor or a dummy?

39:03.527 --> 39:06.280
I don't know,
what's the difference?

39:07.072 --> 39:09.245
He's so hot.

39:09.450 --> 39:11.794
- Aah, oh, my gosh, he's on fire.
- Totally.

39:11.994 --> 39:14.213
No, I mean he's really on fire.

39:14.413 --> 39:18.463
Hey, Hufnagel, do you...?
Smell something burning?

39:18.667 --> 39:20.635
Aah, ugh!

39:25.382 --> 39:28.010
Christine must win!

39:28.218 --> 39:32.394
Security, find that Phantom.
Find him, find him!

39:33.891 --> 39:36.110
Waldo? Hey, you're not leaving,
are you, buddy?

39:36.310 --> 39:41.441
No, heh, I thought I'd stay and risk
my life for a stupid talent show.

39:41.649 --> 39:43.367
Hey, that's fanta--
Hey.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.569
Of course I'm leaving.

39:45.778 --> 39:49.282
And the rest of you will too,
if you have any sense.

39:49.657 --> 39:51.659
Ahem, my card.

39:51.867 --> 39:52.914
Give it to me.

39:53.118 --> 39:55.166
Come on, give it to me.

39:56.622 --> 39:58.545
Girlasaurus Rex!

39:58.749 --> 39:59.796
You're on.

40:01.961 --> 40:04.931
- We are...
- Girlasaurus Rex!

40:08.884 --> 40:13.310
One, two, one, two, three, four!

40:26.235 --> 40:29.990
Uh, strum, strum, twang!

40:37.913 --> 40:40.416
Christine must win.

40:43.127 --> 40:46.848
K.T.? Where is he?
Where is he?

40:47.047 --> 40:49.345
He's in the prop room.
He's in the coffee...

40:49.550 --> 40:53.430
He's everywhere.
What the heck?

40:53.929 --> 40:55.772
Don't worry. We'll find him.
Let's split up.

40:57.224 --> 40:58.396
Okay. The other way.

41:00.894 --> 41:05.240
Find him.
Now, now, now, now.

41:05.441 --> 41:06.818
Right, we're out of here.

41:07.026 --> 41:08.744
Heh, ladies, where are you going?
Come on.

41:08.944 --> 41:12.573
Dude, someone busted our instruments.
What's next, our heads?

41:12.780 --> 41:15.499
- Think we can catch up with Waldo?
- What do you mean, "we"?

41:15.658 --> 41:18.081
- Come back here.
- We've gotta do something.

41:18.244 --> 41:20.121
- Velma, you've seen all the acts, right?
- Yeah.

41:20.329 --> 41:23.003
Who you think the frontrunners are?
I mean, of the ones that are left?

41:23.207 --> 41:26.256
Honestly? You guys,
the violin girl and Chrissy.

41:26.461 --> 41:30.591
So if the Phantom wants Chrissy to win,
he'll try to get rid of Emma and us.

41:30.798 --> 41:33.768
Velma, can you get Emma's parents
to take her someplace safe?

41:33.968 --> 41:34.403
Sure.

41:34.429 --> 41:36.166
We're gonna set a
trap for the Phantom.

41:36.345 --> 41:38.018
And Daphne and I will be the bait.

41:38.222 --> 41:41.692
Oh, heh, good.
I mean, yeah, whatever.

41:44.437 --> 41:47.316
Well, uh, we're gonna
take a nap now.

41:47.523 --> 41:49.366
In our dressing room.

41:49.525 --> 41:51.243
Um, no one cares?

41:51.444 --> 41:56.041
Yeah, so, uh, we'll be asleep and napping.
Just totally unprotected.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.915
- In our dressing room. Asleep.
- Unguarded.

42:00.119 --> 42:03.589
- In our dressing room.
- Unguarded.

42:08.544 --> 42:12.594
- Hang tight. Something's bound to happen.
- To you, right? Not to us?

42:12.799 --> 42:14.267
What? I'm just asking.

42:14.467 --> 42:16.185
Hey, it's a fair question.

42:18.888 --> 42:21.437
Just a matter of time now.

42:41.994 --> 42:45.294
This is ridiculous.
We've been waiting forever.

42:45.498 --> 42:48.593
And, Velma, would you get
your elbow out of my ribs?

42:48.793 --> 42:51.672
I'm over here, Shaggy.

42:52.964 --> 42:54.637
Then whose big elbow...?

42:59.053 --> 43:00.145
What is it?

43:02.140 --> 43:03.266
Phantom!

43:10.189 --> 43:12.442
He must have gone through there.

43:12.650 --> 43:15.494
Like, I hate hidden passages.

43:15.695 --> 43:18.665
They never lead anywhere good.

43:28.916 --> 43:33.797
When's the last time we were in a hidden
passage and it led to, like, miniature golf?

43:39.760 --> 43:42.934
We're in the sewer
below the Opera House.

44:10.791 --> 44:14.841
Like, these sewers have so many
passageways, how are we gonna find--?

44:15.004 --> 44:16.426
Shh!

44:30.311 --> 44:31.904
Rats!

44:59.548 --> 45:00.765
Huh?

45:03.719 --> 45:05.972
Aah! Bats!

45:27.660 --> 45:30.755
Good thing this sweater
is a cable-knit.

45:34.417 --> 45:35.669
There it is again.

45:45.469 --> 45:47.437
This way.

46:14.498 --> 46:16.125
- Ha!
- Yipe!

46:16.292 --> 46:19.296
I suppose it was only
a matter of time until someone found me.

46:19.503 --> 46:22.052
Welcome to my home.

46:22.256 --> 46:26.352
I have lived here in the dank,
reeking sewers all my life...

46:26.552 --> 46:28.225
...forced to hide from society...

46:28.429 --> 46:32.775
...to conceal the hideous,
twisted mass of flesh that is my face.

46:32.975 --> 46:36.570
But now, I can hide no longer.

46:36.771 --> 46:41.368
Behold,
the Phantom of the Opera!

46:46.405 --> 46:48.282
Um, you look fine.

46:49.116 --> 46:50.959
I what?

46:51.160 --> 46:54.209
I mean, you're no Brad Pitt
or anything, but you're okay.

46:57.708 --> 47:03.260
But look. Gaze upon my foul,
deformed visage. I'm hideous. Hideous.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.263
Dude,
this is a funhouse mirror.

47:07.468 --> 47:10.722
It is? But this is the only mirror
I've ever looked in.

47:10.930 --> 47:15.310
I mean, I don't have any others, and
when I go out I always wear the mask.

47:16.352 --> 47:19.652
Hey, I look good.

47:20.356 --> 47:21.858
Well, this is embarrassing.

47:22.024 --> 47:23.401
Wow, uh, ehh!

47:23.567 --> 47:25.535
I wish I had the last 40 years back.

47:25.694 --> 47:28.322
Uh, so it's super
awkward right now.

47:28.531 --> 47:29.828
I, uh... Anyway, yeah.

47:30.032 --> 47:32.501
- Mr. Phantom--
- Steve. Steve Trilby.

47:32.660 --> 47:35.914
Uh, Steve. Why have you been
sabotaging the talent show?

47:36.622 --> 47:37.669
The what now?

47:37.873 --> 47:39.250
<i>Talent Star?
The TV show?</i>

47:39.458 --> 47:42.132
You wrecked instruments
and set fire to a dummy, and--

47:42.336 --> 47:45.180
Not me. I haven't been up at all lately,
except to get food.

47:45.381 --> 47:47.349
Is that why you were
in our dressing room?

47:47.550 --> 47:49.928
That's the secret door
to the vending machines.

47:50.136 --> 47:52.605
I like those burritos.
The bean and cheese ones?

47:52.805 --> 47:54.352
But back in the '70s...

47:54.557 --> 47:56.605
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I did some stuff back then.

47:56.809 --> 47:57.856
Stuff I'm not proud of.

47:58.060 --> 48:00.529
It was when they turned
the Opera House into a disco.

48:00.729 --> 48:02.527
I had loved the opera so much.

48:02.731 --> 48:04.529
I can hear everything
from down here.

48:04.733 --> 48:06.986
But that disco music
made me crazy.

48:07.194 --> 48:09.697
And those ridiculous outfits
the people wore.

48:09.905 --> 48:13.409
You know, the little neck scarf thingies
and the mini-skirts and...

48:14.326 --> 48:17.751
Oh!
But on you guys they work.

48:17.955 --> 48:20.128
Anyway, that was when
I was young and impetuous.

48:20.332 --> 48:23.506
I haven't bothered anyone
for almost 40 years now.

48:23.711 --> 48:26.931
Could I, um, see that mirror again?

48:29.049 --> 48:32.178
Look at me. I'm an Adonis.

48:32.386 --> 48:34.684
Guys, I'm pretty sure
he's telling the truth.

48:34.889 --> 48:37.608
But if he isn't behind everything
that's going on, then who...?

48:53.448 --> 48:55.041
Huh?

48:55.200 --> 48:56.292
Hello!

48:56.493 --> 48:58.461
Uh, kind of stuck up here.

48:58.620 --> 49:00.213
Oh!

49:00.872 --> 49:04.001
So could someone get a ladder,
or something?

49:04.209 --> 49:05.711
What happened?

49:05.877 --> 49:07.925
The harness is part
of my disappearing trick.

49:08.087 --> 49:11.091
I was working on it when the Phantom
shoved me off that catwalk.

49:11.299 --> 49:13.347
Hey, what's that up there?

49:13.551 --> 49:15.474
Oh, no, it's the Phantom.

49:18.723 --> 49:20.600
I'm going after him.
Watch the exits.

49:20.808 --> 49:23.357
- We'll put out the fire.
- Yeah.

49:40.453 --> 49:42.080
Come on, work.

49:43.581 --> 49:44.924
Thanks, Scoo-- Whoa!

49:47.418 --> 49:50.171
Like, double thanks.

49:57.053 --> 49:58.100
- Aah!
- Ow.

49:58.263 --> 49:59.731
You're squeezing my arm.

50:13.611 --> 50:15.363
- Aah!
- Look out!

50:15.530 --> 50:17.203
Ow. Quit it.

50:48.980 --> 50:51.358
Mel Richmond?

50:52.650 --> 50:55.028
I think I'm dying.

50:55.194 --> 50:57.242
Um, actually I'm pretty
sure you're okay.

50:57.447 --> 51:00.075
But look, I'm all bloody.

51:00.658 --> 51:04.333
There's some red paint on the... Do you
understand how mirrors work at all?

51:04.537 --> 51:07.290
Give me a break,
I grew up in a sewer.

51:12.086 --> 51:14.930
So you were gonna burn the place down
for the insurance money?

51:15.131 --> 51:17.304
Yes. And I would have
gotten away with it too...

51:17.508 --> 51:20.933
...if it hadn't been for you
meddling kids and your nosy dog.

51:21.137 --> 51:22.184
Dog? Where?

51:22.388 --> 51:24.061
- Zoinks!
- Uh-oh!

51:25.475 --> 51:26.772
Get back here.

51:30.104 --> 51:31.151
Relax, Richmond.

51:31.356 --> 51:37.580
- Is this the guy?
- That's him, officer. Mel Richmond.

51:38.404 --> 51:40.327
Wait.
This still doesn't make sense.

51:40.531 --> 51:44.001
If you wanted the insurance money,
why didn't you just burn the place down?

51:44.202 --> 51:45.829
- Why all the other stuff?
- I didn't.

51:46.037 --> 51:49.132
But whoever did gave me the idea
to put on this costume.

51:49.332 --> 51:51.300
Stupidest idea I ever had.

51:54.337 --> 51:57.591
- Christine must win!
- What the heck?

51:57.799 --> 52:02.430
Otherwise, I will rain death
and destruction down upon this place!

52:02.637 --> 52:05.356
So swears the Phantom!

52:08.726 --> 52:10.319
Now will you take this seriously?

52:10.520 --> 52:14.616
I want as many officers as you can
spare here for the show tonight.

52:14.816 --> 52:16.568
I was thinking the same thing buddy.
We're on it.

52:16.776 --> 52:19.120
So you'll do it?
You'll put all your men on this?

52:19.320 --> 52:21.243
And can you keep
that dog out of here too?

52:21.447 --> 52:24.951
Hello!
I still need a ladder!

52:25.159 --> 52:31.462
Hello!
The Great Pauldini is not pleased!

52:34.168 --> 52:35.465
Stop that dog.

52:51.728 --> 52:55.778
Well, well, guess they got away
because they're not here.

52:56.733 --> 52:59.452
Anywhere and aha!

53:03.614 --> 53:05.537
Darn it.

53:14.500 --> 53:16.093
- Brick!
- Aah!

53:17.628 --> 53:19.847
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just in there. Not doing anything.

53:20.047 --> 53:21.890
I was doing something
but it was nothing.

53:22.091 --> 53:24.890
Like, we have a totally
great act for you.

53:25.094 --> 53:26.562
Oh. Oh! Uh...

53:26.721 --> 53:30.146
Well, fantastic.
By all means, proceed.

53:31.601 --> 53:35.401
Say, Scooby-doo,
what bone will a dog never eat?

53:35.605 --> 53:39.075
I don't know, Shaggy.
What bone will a dog never eat?

53:39.609 --> 53:41.407
A trombone.

53:43.821 --> 53:48.372
- Heh, yeah, that's fan... Security.
- Aah!

53:48.534 --> 53:51.413
Scoob, what vegetable do you get
when you cross a dog with a rose?

53:51.621 --> 53:53.544
- I don't know, Shaggy.
- A collie-flower.

53:55.291 --> 53:56.417
Dog!

54:00.546 --> 54:02.844
- Mr. Pimiento?
- Blake and Jones.

54:03.049 --> 54:05.427
- Well, you must be happy.
- Why?

54:05.635 --> 54:09.105
Your odds of winning are way up.
Because there are only four acts left.

54:09.305 --> 54:11.603
Three.
The Great Pauldini just quit.

54:11.808 --> 54:16.985
Heh, whatever. Anyway, the publicity the
Phantom has generated has been fantastic.

54:17.188 --> 54:19.111
We're expecting our
highest ratings ever.

54:21.567 --> 54:23.911
Come on,
let me show you the projections.

54:24.111 --> 54:25.533
The sound room, huh?

54:31.828 --> 54:32.875
Still on.

54:37.542 --> 54:39.135
Hmm?

54:41.212 --> 54:45.592
So this would be heard
on the stage. Interesting.

54:46.175 --> 54:48.348
Do you keep the footage
all the cameras in here shoot?

54:48.553 --> 54:51.602
Well, of course. There's a whole
digital database on the server.

54:51.806 --> 54:53.274
- Could I look through it?
- Sure.

54:53.474 --> 54:55.442
But there's 2000 hours
of footage in there.

54:55.643 --> 55:00.740
Oh, man. Now there's no way I'm gonna
have time to go see the soap diamond.

55:12.577 --> 55:14.295
<i>Talent Star was starting
to get old...</i>

55:14.495 --> 55:18.500
...but this Phantom thing
has really spiced it up.

55:18.708 --> 55:22.133
If the Phantom shows up
we might really see someone get hurt.

55:22.336 --> 55:24.885
Oh, I hope.
I hope, heh.

55:26.924 --> 55:29.268
There's a lot of police
at the Opera House, Scooby.

55:29.468 --> 55:32.847
So if we're gonna get in,
this disguise has gotta be a good one.

55:34.056 --> 55:36.024
And voila.

55:36.225 --> 55:38.944
Perfect. Like, I think
this is gonna work, Scooby-doo.

55:39.145 --> 55:41.614
- Yeah.
- Now repeat after me.

55:41.814 --> 55:45.864
- These kids today...
- These kids today...

55:46.068 --> 55:51.199
...darn newfangled contraptions.
- ...darn newfangled contraptions.

55:51.407 --> 55:55.037
Excuse me, sonny. Does this
computer have an Internet in it?

55:55.244 --> 55:59.044
Excuse me, sonny. Does this
computer have an Internet in it?

55:59.248 --> 56:01.751
By George, I think he's got it.

56:05.963 --> 56:08.216
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Talent Star finals.

56:08.424 --> 56:11.394
I'm your host, the man, Brick Pimiento.

56:12.845 --> 56:15.644
Now, I'm sure you've all heard
that we've had some trouble.

56:18.809 --> 56:21.153
Mm-hm, terrible business.
Terrible.

56:21.354 --> 56:24.824
Because of this so-called Phantom,
we're down to just three acts.

56:25.024 --> 56:26.446
<i>Emma...</i>

56:26.651 --> 56:28.369
...Blake and Jones...

56:28.569 --> 56:30.697
...and Chrissy.

56:30.905 --> 56:32.828
Fantastic, ha, ha.

56:33.032 --> 56:38.128
By the end of the show tonight, one will
be crowned this year's Talent Star.

56:38.328 --> 56:40.205
The others will receive
a year's supply of Fudge-a-Roni.

56:40.413 --> 56:42.757
Fudge-a-Roni, the great taste of fudge
with the convenience of roni.

56:42.916 --> 56:44.133
Ooh!

56:46.252 --> 56:49.381
As you know, on Talent Star,
you decide the winner.

56:49.589 --> 56:51.057
You can vote by text or online.

56:51.257 --> 56:54.852
Your votes will be tallied in real time
and displayed on this scoreboard.

56:55.011 --> 57:01.235
Heh, and now, going out live
all over the world, I give you Chrissy!

- Aah.

57:34.968 --> 57:37.767
You were right, Emma,
you do make better bait than us.

57:48.398 --> 57:49.524
Lance Damon?

57:52.777 --> 57:54.779
So it was you all along?

57:54.988 --> 57:56.205
- When it wasn't Mel.
- Ugh.

57:56.406 --> 57:59.876
I would have gotten away with it if it
hadn't been for you meddling kids...

58:00.076 --> 58:02.625
...and your nosy old guy?

58:03.913 --> 58:06.541
Thanks, we'll take it from here.

58:06.750 --> 58:10.220
Blake and Jones.
You're on in 30 seconds.

58:10.795 --> 58:14.140
Brick. Blake and Jones have been cued.
They'll be on in 30.

58:16.259 --> 58:19.809
These darn newfangled kids.

58:20.013 --> 58:24.018
Ugh, your grandfather
smells like a dog.

58:25.393 --> 58:27.236
Yeah?
Well, you smell like lemons.

58:27.437 --> 58:30.441
It's the hand sanitizer.

58:31.232 --> 58:32.404
- Lemons.
- Lemons.

58:32.609 --> 58:34.327
Like the Phantom.

58:40.784 --> 58:44.379
Ugh, one side, doofus.
I killed out there.

58:44.579 --> 58:47.298
Heh, yeah,
fantastic.

58:47.499 --> 58:50.469
Uh, by the way, they just arrested
your dad, ciao.

58:51.419 --> 58:53.763
- Ugh.
- Sweetheart, daddy's in trouble.

58:53.963 --> 58:56.716
I told that pinhead
to watch his step. Idiots.

58:56.925 --> 59:00.646
Fantastic, Chrissy, just fantastic.
Wow, look at those numbers.

59:00.845 --> 59:03.098
Up next, Blake and Jones.

59:29.999 --> 59:31.922
I don't know.
He's supposed to be here?

59:32.127 --> 59:34.221
- Where the heck is Dewey?
- Like, nobody knows.

59:34.379 --> 59:36.848
Well, wherever he is,
he's still wearing his headset.

59:37.048 --> 59:40.348
I can hear him. He's breathing hard.
Sounds like he's running and muttering.

59:40.552 --> 59:44.147
Something about soap. But that's what
he's always talking about so...

59:44.347 --> 59:46.224
- Mind if I borrow this? Thanks.
- Hey.

59:46.432 --> 59:50.187
Hey, you, yes. Get me another earpiece.
And a latte. Yeah, yeah, fantastic.

59:50.395 --> 59:54.195
Come on, Scoob.
We've got to get to Dewey's office.

59:57.193 --> 01:00:00.037
- Soap.
- Yeah. That's what he's talking about.

01:00:00.238 --> 01:00:03.833
The soap diamond.
It's right around the corner.

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:06.161
What the heck are you guys
doing in here?

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.667
Guys. Wait till you see
this footage I found of--

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:12.672
No time. Dewey. Phantom.
Soap diamond.

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.092
Dewey's the Phantom too.

01:00:17.297 --> 01:00:20.016
He told the police to assign
everyone they have here.

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:23.766
He must have done that so no one would
be watching the mineralogical society.

01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:26.189
This way.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.398
Knock them dead, Emma.

01:00:31.436 --> 01:00:32.562
Is he saying anything?

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:36.567
Oh, I can hear traffic.
He's outside.

01:00:36.774 --> 01:00:40.495
Like, he just said "Got it."
We might be too late.

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:46.576
There.

01:00:48.536 --> 01:00:50.163
Dewey!

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:51.752
Uh...

01:00:54.542 --> 01:00:58.342
I am the Phantom.
I know nothing of this Dewey.

01:00:58.546 --> 01:01:02.722
Dude, we know it's you.
You're still wearing your headset.

01:01:02.884 --> 01:01:04.306
Huh?

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.764
Oh, darn.

01:01:17.732 --> 01:01:19.609
The soap diamond.

01:01:23.154 --> 01:01:25.248
No!

01:01:26.824 --> 01:01:28.747
Way to go, Scooby-doo.

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.336
Uh-oh!

01:01:34.499 --> 01:01:36.797
I want that diamond!

01:01:57.897 --> 01:01:59.399
Ha!

01:02:04.404 --> 01:02:06.327
To the Mystery Machine.

01:02:38.313 --> 01:02:42.989
Ugh, ew, ew! Ew!

01:02:53.411 --> 01:02:56.290
Yikes!
Freddy, he's gaining on us.

01:03:11.137 --> 01:03:12.730
Ew, icky.

01:03:15.099 --> 01:03:17.352
He's still right behind us. Huh?

01:03:44.962 --> 01:03:48.057
Heh, I can't watch.
Thanks, Scoob.

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:54.973
There's no way we can lose him.

01:03:56.516 --> 01:03:58.518
- He's just too fast.
- Look out.

01:04:01.354 --> 01:04:03.732
What are we gonna do?

01:04:05.024 --> 01:04:07.026
Give me that bag.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:54.031
Hold it right there.

01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:57.618
Like, heh, that's actually
a pretty good suggestion.

01:05:02.581 --> 01:05:05.209
That is the cleanest sword
I've ever seen.

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:07.010
Thank you.

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:09.258
Now I'll take that bag.
Huh?

01:05:16.803 --> 01:05:18.976
The bag, hand it over.

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:21.149
Why do you want this diamond
so badly, anyway?

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:25.900
I need it to complete my collection
of cleanliness themed treasures.

01:05:26.104 --> 01:05:29.984
I've already stolen the Ammonia Lisa
and the Sponge of Turin.

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:31.569
So that was you.

01:05:31.776 --> 01:05:35.030
Uh-huh. But you need three things
to make a collection.

01:05:35.238 --> 01:05:39.084
Three things.
Two is just bookends.

01:05:40.952 --> 01:05:43.831
Now give me the bag.

01:05:47.542 --> 01:05:49.544
- No!
- Dewey.

01:06:02.265 --> 01:06:05.644
Garbage. Unclean.
Unclean.

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:07.687
Ew, ew, ew!

01:06:07.854 --> 01:06:09.572
But I got the diamond.

01:06:09.773 --> 01:06:13.494
Oh, the soap diamond, gotta find it,
gotta find it, ugh.

01:06:13.652 --> 01:06:15.245
Heh, I've got it.

01:06:17.197 --> 01:06:19.416
Ha, ha. Huh?

01:06:21.535 --> 01:06:26.257
Hmm, yuck, a slobbery dog bone.
Ugh.

01:06:26.414 --> 01:06:28.166
Ooh, too bad.

01:06:38.593 --> 01:06:42.268
And I would have gotten away with it if
it hadn't been for you meddling kids...

01:06:42.472 --> 01:06:45.897
...and your filthy,
germy dog.

01:07:06.621 --> 01:07:10.342
Emma Gale, everyone.
Fantastic.

01:07:10.542 --> 01:07:13.637
Just fantastic, heh.
Hey, look at those numbers.

01:07:13.837 --> 01:07:15.009
Oh, it's going to be close.

01:07:15.171 --> 01:07:17.014
- Ugh.
- Oh, it is going to be close.

01:07:19.968 --> 01:07:22.517
And the voting closes now.

01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:30.021
Fantastic. Fantastic.
Unbelievable. It's a tie.

01:07:30.228 --> 01:07:34.324
Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to
need a tie-breaking encore performance.

01:07:34.524 --> 01:07:37.198
Right here tonight,
right after these messages.

01:07:38.987 --> 01:07:40.113
- This is--
- Fantastic?

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:42.791
Yes. A tie. Do you have
another piece you can do?

01:07:42.991 --> 01:07:45.289
- Yeah, but Daphne and Fred.
- What about them?

01:07:45.493 --> 01:07:48.042
They aren't here.
They're chasing down another Phantom.

01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:51.125
- Another?
- Apparently this time it's Dewey.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:54.052
Heh, always knew there was something
not right about that guy.

01:07:54.252 --> 01:07:57.802
- You. You're the new assistant director.
- Sir, you won't regret this-

01:07:58.006 --> 01:07:59.508
Don't care.
Emma's up after the break.

01:07:59.716 --> 01:08:01.468
We'll just hope Blake and Jones
get back in time. Go.

01:08:04.429 --> 01:08:06.431
- Blake and Jones?
- That's us.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.892
- We caught--
- Dewey Ottoman.

01:08:08.099 --> 01:08:10.773
Yeah, that Brick guy called,
we know everything.

01:08:10.977 --> 01:08:14.106
- Here's the soap diamond, officer.
- Good work. Now, hop in.

01:08:14.314 --> 01:08:17.193
You tied with the violin girl
so you gotta do a tie-breaker.

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:19.027
We'll take you back
to the show.

01:08:19.234 --> 01:08:21.953
- Oh, heh, you don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:24.408
I got 50 bucks
on you to win.

01:08:28.078 --> 01:08:31.082
So Dewey was the Phantom
who "faded away" in that stairwell.

01:08:31.288 --> 01:08:34.042
- How did he do that?
- I checked the camera in the stairwell.

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.627
He had made a video loop
of the empty stairwell...

01:08:36.836 --> 01:08:38.634
...and spliced it
into the camera feed.

01:08:38.837 --> 01:08:40.636
Of course.
So when he ran in there...

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.638
He activated the loop
with a remote...

01:08:42.841 --> 01:08:45.685
...switching the view on the monitor
to the empty stairwell...

01:08:45.886 --> 01:08:48.935
...and making it look like he disappeared.
- Very clever.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.944
But, guys, you'll never guess
what I found...

01:08:53.144 --> 01:08:55.818
...when I went through
all the backstage camera footage.

01:08:56.022 --> 01:08:58.366
This is gonna blow
your socks off.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.777
Fantastic, Emma,
just fantastic.

01:09:43.361 --> 01:09:45.238
And look at those numbers.

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:49.372
Now it's Blake and
Jones's turn and...

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:53.421
Well, heh, apparently,
they are not in the building.

01:09:53.621 --> 01:09:57.091
- So it looks like they forfeit their--
You can't bring that dog in here!

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:02.510
Hold it right there.

01:10:02.714 --> 01:10:06.810
That dog was instrumental in the
apprehension of a dangerous felon.

01:10:06.968 --> 01:10:09.471
Uh, you can bring that
dog in here.

01:10:10.889 --> 01:10:12.891
Come on. We have to make
some arrangements.

01:10:18.646 --> 01:10:21.820
Ladies and gentlemen, Blake and
Jones are here for their tie-breaker.

01:10:22.025 --> 01:10:24.027
- Where were you?
- We caught another Phantom.

01:10:24.235 --> 01:10:25.953
Fantastic, just fantastic.

01:10:26.154 --> 01:10:27.827
- How many does that make now?
- Three.

01:10:28.031 --> 01:10:30.955
- Four if you count the original Phantom.
- Call me Steve.

01:10:32.118 --> 01:10:34.120
Fantastic work.
Fantastic.

01:10:34.329 --> 01:10:36.502
Are you ready
for your tie-breaker performance?

01:10:36.706 --> 01:10:40.677
- We have to do our song again?
- Well, no, you have to do another song, heh.

01:10:40.877 --> 01:10:42.550
Grab your guitar,
you're on.

01:10:42.754 --> 01:10:45.928
Blake and Jones, ladies and gentlemen.
Aren't they fantastic?

01:10:46.132 --> 01:10:48.305
What are we gonna do?
We didn't rehearse anything else.

01:10:48.468 --> 01:10:50.766
I know.
We don't have another song.

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:53.018
- Wait. Yes, we do.
- What?

01:10:53.223 --> 01:10:56.193
You know that song you wrote?
Well, I wrote some words for it.

01:10:56.392 --> 01:10:59.987
- You did? Why didn't you tell me?
- Just start playing. This will work.

01:11:00.188 --> 01:11:04.034
- It has to.
- Blake and Jones, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.577
What is it now?

01:11:10.782 --> 01:11:13.501
You're going to help us
with a little surprise.

Fantastic! Look at the scoreboard.

01:12:56.553 --> 01:12:57.679
Oh.

01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:59.977
Fred.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:11.782
Say, Fred, what bone
will a dog never eat?

01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:20.414
I don't know, Daphne.

01:13:21.662 --> 01:13:23.335
A trombone.

01:13:27.334 --> 01:13:30.679
<i>Say, Fred, what vegetable do you get
when you cross a dog with a rose?</i>

01:13:30.879 --> 01:13:33.758
- I don't know, Daphne.
- A collie-flower.

01:13:36.969 --> 01:13:39.939
- What the heck are they doing?
- They're throwing the contest.

01:13:40.138 --> 01:13:43.108
So Emma can win and her family
can keep their farm.

01:13:43.266 --> 01:13:46.486
Oh, that is so sweet.

01:13:46.687 --> 01:13:49.987
<i>Say, Fred, what did the dog
say to the tree?</i>

01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:53.034
- I don't know, Daphne!
- Bark!

01:14:02.703 --> 01:14:08.255
Well, that was uncomfortable, heh.
All right. The voting closes...

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.385
NOW!

01:14:10.585 --> 01:14:15.432
Fantastic.
The winner is Emma Gale.

01:14:22.139 --> 01:14:25.564
Congratulations, Emma.
Fantastic. Just fantastic.

01:14:25.767 --> 01:14:28.611
And Blake and Jones,
you may not have won...

01:14:28.812 --> 01:14:31.315
...but congratulations on catching
all of the Phantoms.

01:14:31.523 --> 01:14:34.527
- All of them, every last one.
- Not quite all.

01:14:34.735 --> 01:14:37.158
Velma, roll the footage.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.673
- That's enough, Pimiento.
- Wait, you don't understand.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.093
I had to do it. The ratings
have been dropping for years.

01:14:59.301 --> 01:15:00.644
I needed the publicity.

01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:04.690
You don't know what it's like, being around
all you talented people all the time...

01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:06.107
...and being me.

01:15:06.308 --> 01:15:10.529
What am I good at? Nothing. All I do
is smile and say "fantastic" a lot.

01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:14.154
- I'm pathetic.
- Come on, Pimiento.

01:15:14.357 --> 01:15:16.109
I would have gotten away with it,
if it hadn't been for--

01:15:16.318 --> 01:15:19.492
Those meddling kids and their nosy dog.
Yeah, yeah, we know.

01:15:19.696 --> 01:15:22.745
- You figure this is the last one?
- I don't know.

01:15:22.949 --> 01:15:27.045
Hey, is anyone else the Phantom?
Show of hands?

01:15:27.245 --> 01:15:29.748
Yeah, looks like we got them all.

01:15:31.374 --> 01:15:34.594
You guys owe me 50 bucks.

01:15:35.545 --> 01:15:37.422
- Uh...
- So, heh...

01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:40.763
Well, a big thank-you
to all our contestants.

01:15:40.967 --> 01:15:45.097
Live from Chicago, this is Steve Trilby
for Talent Star, saying...

01:15:45.305 --> 01:15:48.730
...if you've got the talent,
we've got the star.

01:15:48.934 --> 01:15:51.153
Good night, America.

01:15:53.855 --> 01:15:55.402
This guy's good.

01:16:01.154 --> 01:16:04.203
Scooby-dooby-doo!

01:16:08.055 --> 01:16:14.055
<i><font color="#ff0000" face="Bizarro">Subtitles by "Ghost Who Walks"</font></i>

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.553
We're just gonna run in
and pick up some snacks!

01:16:20.757 --> 01:16:23.931
- Yeah!
- Don't go overboard!

01:16:27.472 --> 01:16:29.099
<i>It was announced today...</i>

01:16:29.266 --> 01:16:31.519
<i>...that Talent Star will be returning
for a tenth season.</i>

01:16:31.726 --> 01:16:37.483
<i>Outgoing host Brick Pimiento will be
replaced by Steve "The Phantom" Trilby.</i>

01:16:37.691 --> 01:16:40.194
- Huh, didn't see that coming.
- Me neither.

01:16:42.779 --> 01:16:44.326
It's driving me crazy!

01:16:44.531 --> 01:16:46.158
- Did he kiss me because he really likes me...
- Oh!

01:16:46.324 --> 01:16:47.496
...or was it all part of the show?

01:16:47.701 --> 01:16:49.499
And does he know that
I really like him?

01:16:49.703 --> 01:16:53.333
How many times to I have to say it?
Just talk to him!

01:16:56.084 --> 01:16:57.677
Huh?

01:16:57.836 --> 01:17:01.136
Guys!
I told you not to go overboard!

01:17:01.339 --> 01:17:04.138
I know, that's why we just
got a couple little things.

01:17:04.342 --> 01:17:06.561
Like what's up, buddy old pal?
ls something bugging you?

01:17:06.761 --> 01:17:08.058
It's driving me crazy.

01:17:08.263 --> 01:17:11.733
Did she kiss me because she really
likes me or was it all part of the show?

01:17:11.933 --> 01:17:13.810
And does she know
that I really like her?

01:17:14.019 --> 01:17:16.067
How many times do
we have to say it?

01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:17.481
Just talk to her!

01:17:22.777 --> 01:17:24.024
- So anyway, I, um,--
- Hey, I was just--

01:17:24.029 --> 01:17:26.157
- Oh, you go ahead.
- Oh, heh, no, you go ahead.

01:17:26.364 --> 01:17:31.245
Okay. Uh, Fred, I just, you know,
wanted to talk to you.

01:17:31.453 --> 01:17:33.922
- Yes?
- Fred, I like--

01:17:34.122 --> 01:17:36.250
Oh, my gosh!
Have you heard about this?

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.506
Some kind of monster's been spotted
at Goose Lake!

01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:40.804
It's just a few miles from here.

01:17:41.004 --> 01:17:42.802
- Wow.
- We should definitely look into that...

01:17:42.964 --> 01:17:45.092
...right away,
it could be something really big.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.474
All right, everybody.
Let's check out the Goose Lake monster.

01:17:53.225 --> 01:17:56.320
