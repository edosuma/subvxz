WEBVTT

00:36.993 --> 00:38.690
Daryl:
We gotta jam 'em up.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.845
Man: Come on!
Move it!

01:03.454 --> 01:06.327
Take that, you bastards!

01:34.790 --> 01:37.314
Daryl: It's workin'.
They're slowin' down.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.285
Lydia!

01:51.328 --> 01:52.895
Hey, you can't
go back out there!

01:52.938 --> 01:54.592
You know
what Alpha wants.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.420
I'll never
walk with her.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.422
Man: Over there!
Over there!

02:00.294 --> 02:03.210
Ezekiel: Stay with me,
everybody!

02:04.211 --> 02:05.342
It's all right!

02:05.386 --> 02:07.344
It's gonna be fine!
Wait, wait, wait!

02:10.391 --> 02:12.436
Where's Judith?

02:21.576 --> 02:25.145
Aah! Please.
Please...

02:25.188 --> 02:28.713
Please...

02:32.152 --> 02:34.545
Okay, Judith.
Okay, okay.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.331
Let's get to
a safe place.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.558
Man:
Hold the line!

02:47.602 --> 02:50.213
Hold them back!
Hold them back!

02:50.257 --> 02:51.562
Steady!

03:00.267 --> 03:03.531
Eugene!

03:34.518 --> 03:36.694
Fire!

03:38.653 --> 03:40.611
Back!

03:40.655 --> 03:42.787
Daryl:Wall's down. Follow me.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.903
Through the heart.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.775
Aw, shit.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.429
My bad.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.301
Do not miss again.

06:29.345 --> 06:33.001
Many Guardians
were sacrificed.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.613
We must gather.
Replenish.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.180
Well,
I really need

06:38.223 --> 06:41.749
to show you allhow to savor a victory.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.707
It is not a victory

06:43.751 --> 06:47.668
if I do not have
everything I want.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.677
Lydia.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.678
Not your concern.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.331
Then you have seen her?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.421
She's not
amongst the dead.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.771
But I will not stop
until I bring her home.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.468
To you.

07:16.566 --> 07:21.441
I am at your service,
Frowny McTwoKnives.

07:22.529 --> 07:23.791
Gather.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.749
Wait, wait, wait.

07:25.793 --> 07:29.405
You want me
to herd walkers?

07:34.845 --> 07:37.674
Such a dick.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.675
Screw this.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.992
Aw.

09:14.728 --> 09:18.906
All right, Aaron, hold --
hold on one second.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.212
I said hold on,
dammit!

09:21.256 --> 09:23.780
Don't go
and do something stupid.

09:23.824 --> 09:27.218
The only stupid thingwould be to not kill you.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.046
No, look,
I can explain. Just --

09:29.090 --> 09:30.831
Shut up.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.747
Aaron, I am not --

09:33.790 --> 09:36.880
Enough of your bullshit!

10:13.787 --> 10:15.005
Stop.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.790
Sorry, kid.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.444
This shit is done.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.974
Hey,
let me take Adam.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.758
It's all right.You need to --

10:28.802 --> 10:30.717
No, hey, I'm fine.You need to rest.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.762
It's okay.We just gotta keep moving.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.983
Earl and the others could beat the rendezvous already.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.160
Hey,
it's okay.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.031
We're almost there.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.512
Yes, we are.
Oh, yes, we are.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.601
Why don't you should try
talking normal?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.038
Oh, I am talking normal.Aren't I?

10:48.082 --> 10:49.823
I'm talking normal.

10:51.302 --> 10:54.610
That's the creepy baby voice,
Alden.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.048
Nobody likes
the creepy baby voice.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.963
Not even babies.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.400
Let me see
if I can help.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.751
Thought I told you
to stay back.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.057
I can help with Adam.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.319
Yeah,
the hell you can.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.887
Come on.
She knows him.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.541
No,
she knew him.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.718
And her and her peopleleft him to die, remember?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.460
Shh, shh.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.896
It's enoughthat I let her come along.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.855
There's no way she's gettingher hands on this kid.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.334
Move away --
now.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.426
Just try rubbing
the back of his head --

11:28.470 --> 11:30.472
I thought I told youto be quiet!

11:30.515 --> 11:32.256
Just try rubbing
the back of his head

11:32.300 --> 11:33.910
very gently
and very slowly.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.260
And keep making shushing noises
right into his ear,

11:36.304 --> 11:37.871
over and over.

11:39.394 --> 11:42.136
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.359
Let me try.

12:47.157 --> 12:50.030
What was her name?

12:51.205 --> 12:52.772
Your sister.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.643
You never said.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.344
Frances.

13:00.388 --> 13:04.087
Her name was Frances.

13:05.393 --> 13:10.137
And he meant everything
to her.

13:10.180 --> 13:14.794
And she was everythingto you, right?

13:22.627 --> 13:26.196
If I had to do it
all over again...

13:30.984 --> 13:35.771
She should be the one sitting
here holding him, not me.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.181
Let's move.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.226
What's going on?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.272
They're coming.

14:12.416 --> 14:15.898
Follow me! Follow me!Come on!

14:21.121 --> 14:22.731
Come on!

14:49.192 --> 14:52.326
No! No!

14:59.289 --> 15:02.031
Come on!

15:04.207 --> 15:07.123
Hey! Over here!

15:08.951 --> 15:11.345
Come on!

15:47.816 --> 15:49.339
Unh!

15:58.044 --> 16:02.352
You. Will. Walk.

16:02.396 --> 16:05.181
With. Us.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.011
Never!

16:45.656 --> 16:49.182
It's -- It's you.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.800
Shh.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.281
Your voice
sounded familiar, but...

17:01.324 --> 17:04.023
Unh!

18:40.902 --> 18:45.124
Connect the circuit boardto the transponder.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.255
No, no, no.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.084
TNC antenna connection...

18:55.134 --> 18:57.614
Magna:We killed the skins.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.704
Then we crawled
back into the cave.

19:00.748 --> 19:04.882
The sickoswere either dead or...

19:04.926 --> 19:07.798
trapped under rocks
from the...

19:19.332 --> 19:22.204
We kept pushing.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.554
Searching.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.296
Took a turn,

19:27.340 --> 19:33.607
and before we knew it,we were in the horde.

19:33.650 --> 19:37.306
Connie and I
moved together.

19:37.350 --> 19:41.092
The sickos
pushed forward.

19:43.356 --> 19:46.185
Got between us.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.103
And her hand...

19:53.366 --> 19:55.106
...her hand just...

19:55.150 --> 19:57.108
slipped out of mine...

19:57.152 --> 20:01.025
And I...

20:01.069 --> 20:03.202
couldn't find her again.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.904
You're leaving?

20:11.688 --> 20:14.517
Just wanna get there
before dark.

20:14.561 --> 20:17.564
You know,
she's been through a lot.

20:17.607 --> 20:20.741
Might need some more time
to rest.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.310
Stay as long
as you like.

20:24.353 --> 20:27.835
So you're just gonna
leave her behind?

20:27.878 --> 20:29.358
Again?

20:29.402 --> 20:31.578
I didn't say that.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.363
You know,maybe instead of ignoring her,

20:34.407 --> 20:37.061
you try begging
for forgiveness

20:37.105 --> 20:40.239
after the shityou put her through.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.721
You think
that's what she wants from me?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.204
Like it'll fix anything?

20:49.248 --> 20:52.816
We go through shit
to go through shit --

20:52.860 --> 20:54.688
Unh!

21:06.787 --> 21:09.224
What the hell
is wrong with her?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.400
I didn't ask you
to do that.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.141
You're saying
I should've just

21:13.184 --> 21:15.056
let her
treat you like that?I'm saying -- I'm say--

21:15.099 --> 21:16.623
Well,
I am so, so sorry

21:16.666 --> 21:19.103
if I'm just not gonna sit here
and take that.

21:19.147 --> 21:22.368
Things don't alwayswork out the way you want, Miko.

21:22.411 --> 21:25.196
I never said they did!

21:27.242 --> 21:30.201
I can't
do this anymore.

21:37.644 --> 21:43.389
I thought a lot aboutlast time we talked.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.261
And I was so pissed.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.266
But now I get it.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.357
You were right
to kick me out.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.666
At leastI don't have to worry about

21:59.709 --> 22:02.277
someone stealing my pillow
no more.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.672
Well,
all I'll say is,

22:05.715 --> 22:08.152
the nights have been
a lot more peaceful.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.024
I don't snore.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.721
Yeah, right.

23:15.306 --> 23:19.093
I, uh...

23:20.399 --> 23:21.617
I didn't mean
to intrude,

23:21.661 --> 23:23.445
but I felt itincumbent upon my person

23:23.489 --> 23:24.925
to give you
a once-over

23:24.968 --> 23:27.188
after seeing you takea cherry cheesecake like that

23:27.231 --> 23:29.146
to the kisser.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.411
Do you know
what it feels like

23:32.454 --> 23:34.630
to want something
so bad...

23:34.674 --> 23:39.113
and to go after itwith everything that you have...

23:40.462 --> 23:44.510
...piss off everyone --
literally everyone --

23:44.553 --> 23:46.947
maybe get people killed --

23:46.990 --> 23:51.125
and still,you have nothing to show for it?

23:52.169 --> 23:54.694
I do.

24:13.364 --> 24:18.587
You see, there's a meetin'of extraordinarily...

24:18.631 --> 24:21.416
momentous,
do-or-die,

24:21.460 --> 24:23.679
Brobdingnagian proportions.

24:23.723 --> 24:26.508
It's the --It's a big meeting.

24:26.552 --> 24:30.425
It's the biggest meetingof my life.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.863
And it's coming up quickon the calendar,

24:33.907 --> 24:37.345
and unfortunately,I can't share details.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.434
But now,with the grimness at hand,

24:39.478 --> 24:41.088
vis-a-vis Hilltop,

24:41.131 --> 24:44.831
I obviously can no longer attendsaid meeting.

24:47.268 --> 24:50.227
It's just not oftenyou meet someone you...

24:54.884 --> 24:57.757
Another someone,
in general, I mean.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.500
If it's important,
it's simple.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.762
You go.

25:02.805 --> 25:05.504
Well, sure,but I also have obli--

25:05.547 --> 25:08.768
Eugene,
just go to her.

25:19.039 --> 25:22.999
I sincerely hope you getwhat it is that you want.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.578
Nabila's been askingabout her kids.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.101
You sure
Ezekiel has them?

26:21.144 --> 26:23.973
They should be
at the rendezvous.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.111
It feels like
it's still burning.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.982
We're almost there,
baby.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.594
Almost there.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.582
This is the spot,
right?

27:07.626 --> 27:08.801
Yeah.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.890
Nabila: My babies?
Where are my babies?!

27:10.933 --> 27:12.456
Where are my babies?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.502
No.Where are my babies?

27:14.545 --> 27:16.373
Nabila, they're with Ezekiel,
all right?

27:16.417 --> 27:18.071
They're with the king,
they're with the king.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.510
Come on,
spread out.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.338
Come on, let's go.

27:24.381 --> 27:27.602
I'm gonna find them.
I'm gonna find them.

27:33.042 --> 27:36.437
Judith: Earl,think we'll be safe here?

27:38.700 --> 27:41.007
Did they see us?

27:41.050 --> 27:43.009
Earl:
No, we're safe.

27:43.052 --> 27:46.621
I won't let anything
happen to you.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.406
Do you think
Ezekiel's okay?

27:49.450 --> 27:53.454
There was just so much smoke,and I couldn't see,

27:53.497 --> 27:55.630
and then
he was just gone.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.458
He'll be here,
honey.

27:57.501 --> 27:58.720
He will.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.375
He's one of the bravest menI know.

28:01.418 --> 28:04.421
Okay?

28:05.466 --> 28:07.686
Wow.

28:07.729 --> 28:13.300
You are all
doing great.

28:13.343 --> 28:17.826
You all are so good.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.828
You're so good.

28:19.872 --> 28:25.399
Your folks are gonna be so proudwhen they get here.

28:25.442 --> 28:29.098
So proud
when they get here.
Soon?

28:29.142 --> 28:31.710
Oh, yeah.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.538
Soon.
Real soon, sweetheart.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.590
Okay, now.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.418
Shh.

29:53.704 --> 29:57.186
You lied to us.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.715
I did.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.719
But I did it
to protect you.

30:08.763 --> 30:11.679
You can't do this.

30:11.722 --> 30:15.161
I don't have
much choice.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.728
I can stay here
with you.

30:17.772 --> 30:20.819
So you're not alone
when it happens.

30:20.862 --> 30:24.605
Oh, honey,
I'm not alone.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.347
I have Tammy
and my son.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.874
Alden will take
good care of Adam.

30:32.918 --> 30:37.836
And you, Judith...

30:37.879 --> 30:40.795
you're so strong.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.233
You're so brave.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.369
But now I need you

30:49.412 --> 30:52.633
to keep those kids safefrom me.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.809
Please.

30:54.853 --> 30:59.205
Go back out there,

30:59.248 --> 31:02.773
and don't come near me again,okay?

32:03.486 --> 32:05.401
Ezekiel: Jerry.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.490
The kids...

32:07.534 --> 32:10.232
Earl's got the kids!

33:55.990 --> 33:58.123
Daryl!

33:58.166 --> 34:00.081
Hey, hi.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.301
Boy: Daddy!

34:02.344 --> 34:04.172
Hi, buddy.

34:06.522 --> 34:10.178
Is Judith in there?

34:16.184 --> 34:19.100
Judith?

34:52.264 --> 34:55.136
Come here.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.378
Alpha.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.254
That thingyou've been looking for...?

35:26.298 --> 35:28.691
I found it.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.106
It is beautiful.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.371
Pure.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.286
All I see
is a bag of bones

35:58.330 --> 36:01.289
and some
gnarly-ass teeth.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.204
You will see.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.901
Maybe soon.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.991
And I will
meet you there.

36:09.558 --> 36:12.344
You know, I ain't exactly readyto meet my Maker,

36:12.387 --> 36:15.216
if that's
what you're saying.

36:18.088 --> 36:22.310
You proved yourself again
by finding her.

36:22.354 --> 36:28.403
And like the young lion cub
who must leave his pride,

36:28.447 --> 36:31.624
it is time
to roam the Earth.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.713
Build a new pride.

36:33.756 --> 36:37.456
Do you want me out there,preaching your gospel?

36:39.501 --> 36:44.245
I want you
to become a lion.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.514
You know,
I may not be hip

36:52.558 --> 36:55.169
on the whole
Greek alphabet,

36:55.213 --> 36:57.171
but Beta is no Alpha.

36:57.215 --> 37:01.262
And if we're going stickwith the whole lion thing...

37:01.306 --> 37:03.960
then isn't it
the young lioness

37:04.004 --> 37:06.441
who takes
her mother's place?

37:08.008 --> 37:10.358
Walk.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.411
A long time ago,

37:19.454 --> 37:23.980
before meat-lovers like himstarted showing up, I, uh...

37:24.024 --> 37:28.507
I lost somebodythat was close to me.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.813
Pancreatic cancer.

37:30.857 --> 37:34.948
If the disease wasn'teating her up from the inside,

37:34.991 --> 37:38.821
then the chemo was kickingthe ever-loving shit out of her.

37:38.865 --> 37:41.302
And yet...
I don't know.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.608
Maybe, uh...

37:42.651 --> 37:47.090
Maybe the cancer justput things in perspective.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.483
She was, uh...

37:48.527 --> 37:52.095
She was never
more beautiful.

37:53.880 --> 37:57.449
Didn't matter
how frail she got.

37:57.492 --> 38:00.060
Even when
she lost her hair.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.456
Be grateful.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.327
Death...

38:06.371 --> 38:08.634
set her free.

38:08.677 --> 38:12.638
The thing is,
when she was gone,

38:12.681 --> 38:16.468
I just -- I didn't feelmuch of anything anymore.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.426
You know?

38:18.470 --> 38:21.473
I didn't feel scared,I didn't feel happy.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.126
I, uh...

38:23.170 --> 38:25.433
I didn't feel anything.

38:25.477 --> 38:28.436
I was just...here.

38:28.480 --> 38:32.266
And that
is my strength.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.354
Now, me?

38:33.398 --> 38:36.488
I am dead
to this world.

38:36.531 --> 38:37.663
But you?

38:37.706 --> 38:40.448
See,
you are pretending.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.972
You thinkthat it makes you strong

38:43.016 --> 38:45.671
to saythat emotions aren't real,

38:45.714 --> 38:48.282
that we are animals.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.371
That is bullshit.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.330
And you know it.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.896
And now you claim

38:53.940 --> 38:56.508
that you have to killyour own daughter --

38:56.551 --> 38:59.467
your own
flesh and blood...

39:02.209 --> 39:04.951
It is her destiny.

39:11.523 --> 39:14.308
That disease...

39:14.352 --> 39:16.832
took your wife...

39:16.876 --> 39:21.707
because that was
what nature intended.

39:21.750 --> 39:25.493
She could not
take you with her.

39:25.537 --> 39:29.323
But you live every day
wishing she could.

39:32.892 --> 39:36.983
Lydia was made
for this.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.596
To be free.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.207
With me.

40:05.794 --> 40:08.536
You still love her.

40:21.070 --> 40:26.554
I have to do it
because I love her.

40:28.600 --> 40:33.953
She will always
be my baby.

41:00.632 --> 41:03.548
Thank you.

43:02.797 --> 43:06.758
Took you long enough.
