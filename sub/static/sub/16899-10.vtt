00:04.650 --> 00:07.039
Kate, will you be my wife?

00:07.090 --> 00:09.399
Great things lie ahead for us.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.307
You're right.
Great things.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.920
You go by another name
they'll never find you.

00:14.970 --> 00:17.530
The woman's army core
has sent a group of a...

00:17.580 --> 00:18.444
Soldiers

00:18.490 --> 00:20.355
To assist with quality control.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.537
You're in good hands
Sergeant Hill.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.229
There's important work
going on at VicMu.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.362
We need eyes and ears
inside the plant.

00:26.410 --> 00:29.584
Go back to your regular life
and wait for my call.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.019
Our country is my country too.

00:32.070 --> 00:35.767
You treat me like the enemy you
just might get what you're
looking for.

00:35.810 --> 00:39.598
If I don't quit I'm gonna
have to find another way to
stand up straight.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.689
You're pround. I know some
guys, got the same problem.

00:42.730 --> 00:44.254
You should meet 'em.

00:48.570 --> 00:58.525
[Speaking Italian]

01:02.490 --> 01:04.446
Marco - I told you'd
double your money!

01:04.490 --> 01:05.752
[Speaking Italian]

01:05.800 --> 01:08.758
You may got the brawn,
but I got the brains.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.142
Cheers.

01:13.890 --> 01:16.108
[Speaking Italian]

01:16.160 --> 01:17.934
What happened?

01:17.990 --> 01:22.108
[Speaking Italian]

01:22.160 --> 01:24.628
Moe, get me some water, water.

01:24.690 --> 01:26.294
I said water not wine.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.126
Here, Ma.

01:29.430 --> 01:32.433
[Speaking Italian]

01:32.480 --> 01:34.562
Thief, they called me thief.

01:34.610 --> 01:35.861
At the store?

01:35.920 --> 01:37.524
Those stores treat our
mothers like garbage.

01:37.570 --> 01:38.264
[Speaking Italian]

01:38.310 --> 01:40.130
Bastards chased her out.

01:40.180 --> 01:41.397
Which shop was it?

01:41.440 --> 01:43.613
Witham Food.

01:43.660 --> 01:47.664
I heard last week they kicked
out Guido Gallo's mother just
for handling tomatoes.

01:47.710 --> 01:49.143
I am okay, okay!

01:49.190 --> 01:50.407
Sit, Ma, sit.

01:52.890 --> 01:54.539
Party's over boys, get out.

02:00.030 --> 02:03.329
Ma, listen to me.

02:03.380 --> 02:05.507
I'll fix this, okay.

02:12.130 --> 02:17.170
The foiled smuggling
enterprise exposed a few flaws
in factory security.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.346
Such as?

02:18.390 --> 02:20.529
Marco Moretti.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.299
Marco?

02:22.350 --> 02:24.523
Please, the man's a patriot.

02:24.570 --> 02:25.832
People change.

02:28.970 --> 02:31.018
This is our file on him.

02:31.060 --> 02:35.178
Frankie DiCarlo has ties to
the black market and known
fascist sympathizers.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.923
How well do you know Moretti?

02:36.980 --> 02:38.538
Better than most.

02:38.590 --> 02:40.364
If Marco's guilty of anything,

02:40.420 --> 02:42.320
it's loving this country
too much.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.543
Yes?
Then prove it.

02:44.590 --> 02:48.071
Get close to him.
Find out what he knows.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.375
You were eager to be called,
Miss Witham. Ring-ring.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.773
You're surprised?

02:59.830 --> 03:01.388
They arrest folks for speaking
Italian on street corners.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.567
Why not rough up
somebody's mother?

03:03.610 --> 03:05.134
No.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.694
This is some vigliaccio who
thinks he can get away with it.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.139
It's not just one bad apple.
It's everywhere.

03:10.190 --> 03:14.536
It's how they keep us down,
working low-rent jobs and
eating crow.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.879
Where'd you get this
fascist book?

03:22.940 --> 03:24.805
"One King, One Country"

03:24.850 --> 03:26.158
It's garbage.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.725
Truth is, England is
losing this war.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.942
God forbid the neighbours
think these drawers here
belong to me!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.604
You read this?

03:42.650 --> 03:45.653
The Nazis torpedoed a passenger
ferry off Newfoundland.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.565
Awful to think.

03:47.610 --> 03:50.044
German U-boats so
close to our shores.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.261
SS Caribou.

03:51.310 --> 03:54.962
137 civilians,
14 children drowned.

03:55.010 --> 03:56.489
Those poor babies...

03:56.540 --> 03:59.794
Torpedoes tore the boat in
half, sunk in fifteen minutes.

03:59.840 --> 04:05.142
Bob said it was only a matter
of time before something like
this happened.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.804
Won't be home for supper.

04:06.850 --> 04:09.159
Goodness knows who'll
feel like kicking it up

04:11.200 --> 04:12.451
Learning a little two-step?

04:12.510 --> 04:13.590
Hardly.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.460
New instructor, I have
to sign him in.

04:15.510 --> 04:18.377
Last one shipped out.

04:18.430 --> 04:19.988
I am so sorry.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.259
It's just, I saw it on
your daughter's shelf...

04:23.300 --> 04:24.471
Wuthering Heights.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.569
Didn't take you for a romantic.

04:27.610 --> 04:30.078
I read anything
I get my hands on.

04:30.130 --> 04:32.917
Something different to put
my mind to, I guess.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.305
Well, you've got a library here
now, books are for sharing.

04:37.230 --> 04:39.186
Morning.

04:39.230 --> 04:40.447
Mr. Henderson,

04:40.490 --> 04:42.833
didn't I tell you, put
the milk in the bin,

04:42.890 --> 04:44.494
not on the bench.

04:44.540 --> 04:46.496
It's only that Mr. Corbett
preferred...

04:46.540 --> 04:48.405
Mr. Corbett's isn't
here at present

04:48.460 --> 04:51.497
and naughty neighbors
steal my cream.

04:51.550 --> 04:54.895
Yes, Ma'am.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.498
From here on in.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.686
For Pete's sake,
he forgot the butter!

05:06.560 --> 05:08.471
Another routine search?

05:15.750 --> 05:16.956
Witham Foods.

05:18.490 --> 05:19.741
Vera - What's the latest?

05:19.790 --> 05:21.872
After that ferry-sinking,
I need some good news.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.797
It's awful, isn't it.
The enemy is everywhere.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.365
Germans attacking in the
St. Lawrence.

05:27.410 --> 05:31.528
What's next, Japs
crossing the Rockies?

05:31.590 --> 05:32.887
It's nothing but bad news.

05:32.940 --> 05:35.454
Not in the Beacon.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.637
Hey you two lovebirds.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.150
Look who made
the VicMu Beacon!

05:40.200 --> 05:41.201
"Gettin' hitched!

05:41.250 --> 05:43.377
Kate Andrews and
Ivan Buchinslq."

05:45.560 --> 05:47.516
What joker went
and drew that?

05:47.560 --> 05:50.518
Ivan - Yeah. Your hair's
not that curly.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.471
You guys should do it proper.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.340
Put an announcement
In the newspaper.

05:54.390 --> 05:57.393
One back in Winnipeg while we're
at it, make my folks happy.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.079
Yeah, if you want the
whole country to know.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.563
Don't you think it seems
like showing off?

06:02.620 --> 06:05.657
I'm all for making it official.
Let the whole world know.

06:05.710 --> 06:07.405
Vera - Why not?

06:12.450 --> 06:14.406
Going in the wrong direction.

06:14.460 --> 06:15.529
Company halt!

06:18.460 --> 06:19.540
Mrs. Corbett.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.116
What's going on?

06:24.160 --> 06:26.503
New orders. Just got 'em.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.948
Betty - Just like that?

06:27.990 --> 06:28.979
Afraid so.

06:31.470 --> 06:33.518
Company march!

06:40.480 --> 06:41.651
Where they going?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.134
Just know they're shipping out.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.785
Miss McRae, you'll step in
to cover Quality Control

06:46.840 --> 06:49.445
till replacements
can be trained.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.707
I can count on you?

06:50.750 --> 06:52.479
Always.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.632
You're not the only
one getting frisked.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.116
I had to slap a guy for
pawing me last week.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.765
This factory is turning
into a police state.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.681
Hi, chums!

07:13.730 --> 07:17.200
Thought I'd join you
for some fresh air.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.342
Anybody for an oatmeal-
raisin cookie?

07:19.390 --> 07:22.120
Not if they're from
your dad's shop.

07:22.180 --> 07:25.479
Some yahoo from the store on
Dundas called my mother a thief

07:25.530 --> 07:26.952
for picking up an apple!

07:27.010 --> 07:28.659
I don't believe it.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.488
What kind of customers you
think your dad wants at
that shop?

07:34.060 --> 07:36.483
Pasty-faced Englishmen
who bow to the King.

07:41.460 --> 07:42.495
Wow.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.144
Did I horn in here?

07:44.200 --> 07:47.363
Not sure there's much
to horn In on,

07:47.420 --> 07:49.502
seems he'd rather fly solo.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.686
Make room for the new
Commander on Q.C.

07:58.730 --> 08:01.073
Go easy on me, McRae.

08:01.130 --> 08:04.088
Keep your temperatures in check,
Buchinsky, and you'll be fine.

08:04.130 --> 08:06.519
Your friend, Teresa?
She ship out?

08:08.830 --> 08:11.173
Okay let's do this.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.438
Your father's full name.

08:13.490 --> 08:14.525
Daniel Andrews.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.662
Do they really need
to know that?

08:16.710 --> 08:18.666
It's the start of a
beautiful story.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.439
You said he was a veterinarian?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.364
Yes.

08:21.410 --> 08:22.445
In Huntsville.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.493
Huntsville, really?
That's news to me.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.498
Well... just outside.
But with Dad's work.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.110
So Dr. Daniel Andrews.

08:32.160 --> 08:35.857
I think that'll be news
to a lot of folks.

08:40.430 --> 08:44.901
It's sad your parents won't
be there to give away their
beautiful daughter.

08:44.950 --> 08:47.566
It's something I can live with.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.133
So you had a setback.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.136
This was no bump
in the trail.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.487
It was a full-on roadblock.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.962
So try another route.

09:02.010 --> 09:04.444
After what Witham Foods
did to his mother,

09:04.500 --> 09:06.968
I'll be luclq if he ever
talks to me again.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.750
Your friend is treading close
to the edge, Miss Witham.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.675
Your efforts can save him.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.631
How?

09:13.680 --> 09:16.148
Make in-roads with
someone he likes.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.760
There must be a few
folks near him.

09:18.810 --> 09:20.949
A girlfriend?

09:20.990 --> 09:23.333
I didn't promise easy,
Miss Witham.

09:30.390 --> 09:33.564
What do you say we grab a
bite before you go home?

09:33.610 --> 09:36.568
Sounds like you're running a
little light on groceries.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.782
Frankie - Hey!

09:39.840 --> 09:41.000
[Car horn]

09:41.050 --> 09:43.666
Moretti, kiss your
girl and get in the car.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.405
What's going on?

09:45.450 --> 09:47.839
Get in and I'll tell ya.

09:49.410 --> 09:50.399
Sorry Ver.

09:50.450 --> 09:51.792
No, it's okay.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.588
Bye.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.169
Hey.

10:06.210 --> 10:09.509
How about we_make our own
plans and cry In some beer?

10:09.560 --> 10:11.209
No thanks.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.512
I'm not the crying type.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.013
No looking at the floor!

10:38.500 --> 10:39.285
You!

10:39.330 --> 10:41.935
You! Two milks, one cream.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.629
And a butter.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.939
You're the instructor?

10:46.990 --> 10:49.595
Yeah, I got two jobs.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.779
And they got two left feet.

10:54.260 --> 10:57.730
Is that supposed
to be a foxtrot?

10:57.780 --> 11:00.863
Always start with the
basics, I say.

11:02.530 --> 11:05.522
C'mon what do you say we show
these young folks how it's done?

11:05.570 --> 11:08.130
Oh. No no no. I didn't come
here to...

11:08.180 --> 11:11.877
Dance? I'm sure
you can do It.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.573
Alright.

11:15.630 --> 11:18.713
Take a look over here
ladies and gents.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.534
Face your partner.

11:20.590 --> 11:24.412
Take the lady's right
hand in your left.

11:24.460 --> 11:28.590
And of course,
the man always leads.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.605
You're a regular
Ginger Rogers.

11:41.650 --> 11:45.438
You mean Roy Rogers. I
haven't done this in years.

12:03.980 --> 12:05.538
You read that pamphlet?

12:05.590 --> 12:07.194
Yeah I read it.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.198
You know my old man always said
Italy wanted to avoid a war.

12:10.250 --> 12:15.244
He was right and you won't read
that in the English papers.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.372
So what is this place?

12:17.430 --> 12:20.251
Witham Food Warehouse.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.734
Let's get some groceries.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.991
What is this?
What are you doing?

12:27.050 --> 12:30.474
They mess with you.
We're going to mess with them.

12:32.570 --> 12:34.526
Gianna - Enter, enter.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.140
Gladys - They're from my
mother's greenhouse.

12:48.330 --> 12:49.581
Gianna - Sit.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.074
I am very sorry,

12:58.120 --> 13:00.554
what happened at Witham Foods.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.817
Is nothing.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.509
See, I am good.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.645
We welcome everyone
at our stores.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.340
You help with Mi Marito,
my husband.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.039
You good girl.

13:15.090 --> 13:17.308
You like espresso?

13:17.360 --> 13:18.042
Love it!

13:25.450 --> 13:27.498
E biscotti... si?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.588
Biscuits? Sure.

13:29.630 --> 13:31.848
Just a digestive is fine.

13:37.590 --> 13:40.070
And Marco, he is well?

13:40.120 --> 13:43.726
Marco, he's out with Frankie.

13:43.770 --> 13:44.509
Ah!

13:48.470 --> 13:50.859
How long has he known him for?

13:50.910 --> 13:51.695
Oh...

13:53.260 --> 13:55.433
My English...

13:55.480 --> 13:58.005
It's fine.
You're doing great.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.389
So what do those boys
get up to?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.963
Truck driver - What the heck?

14:11.410 --> 14:12.104
Wait, wait.

14:12.150 --> 14:12.969
Hang on.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.499
He ain't suppose to be here.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.711
What the hell are you doing?

14:17.850 --> 14:18.896
Grab some food.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.117
Buy British?

14:21.160 --> 14:23.503
You think I'll let
that go you bastard?

14:23.550 --> 14:24.858
You dirty wop!

14:25.420 --> 14:25.897
No!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.558
Marco - Just stop!

14:36.440 --> 14:39.659
Bastards like this one
threw your father into that
camp like a dog.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.785
He wants us all buying British.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.316
Frankie - This bastard kicks
your mom out of the store.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.196
Frankie - Grab some food. Go on.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.524
Rest assured, Witham Foods
will find_ out who _is
responSIble for thIs.

15:24.570 --> 15:25.696
Mother.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.650
It's good to see
you up and about.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.748
Father's on a call with
The Star.

15:29.790 --> 15:30.961
What happened?

15:31.010 --> 15:32.830
Yes, last night, at the
Witham warehouse.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.142
They were held up.

15:34.190 --> 15:36.181
One of the our
workers was beaten.

15:36.230 --> 15:38.141
Beaten? My goodness...

15:38.190 --> 15:40.841
Your father spent half the
night at the hospital
seeing to the victim.

15:40.890 --> 15:46.237
The attackers were
Italian, no doubt railed
against the war effort.

15:46.290 --> 15:48.064
The police are handling this.

15:48.120 --> 15:51.760
I suggest you speak with them.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.685
Yes, thank you.
Good day.

15:53.730 --> 15:55.982
Was your man badly hurt?

15:56.040 --> 15:58.463
Some lowlife used him
as a punching bag,

15:58.520 --> 15:59.475
but he'll survive.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.908
These people.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.690
They come to this country
but won't live by our rules.

16:03.740 --> 16:07.267
We ought to lock up the rest
of these Italians and be
done with it.

16:07.310 --> 16:08.652
Mother, don't say
such things.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.429
Well? Something needs
to be done.

16:10.490 --> 16:13.960
I hear those people are
being mistreated in
Witham Food stores.

16:14.010 --> 16:15.227
Bloody nonsense!

16:15.270 --> 16:16.669
Hooligans who think
they can browbeat us,

16:16.710 --> 16:17.870
have another thing coming.

16:17.930 --> 16:20.012
Daddy, you need
to calm down.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.108
I am defending our company.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.716
Don't wait on dinner.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.195
Your father
knows what he's doing.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.501
Of course he does.

16:33.550 --> 16:36.201
He has this family's best
interests at heart.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.854
I never said he didn't.

16:37.900 --> 16:41.028
Then why have you gone and
wrested control of your
trust fund?

16:41.080 --> 16:43.207
What's does that have
to do with anything?

16:43.260 --> 16:44.818
Answer the question.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.338
Women all over this country
run their own households now.

16:47.390 --> 16:50.735
I want a little
control over mIne.

16:50.790 --> 16:53.486
You don't run your
own household.

16:53.530 --> 16:55.703
You live under your
father's roof.

17:03.710 --> 17:06.793
This is no good, you
got dust in the shell.

17:06.850 --> 17:08.533
Could've sworn I
cleaned it properly.

17:08.590 --> 17:11.286
Well you didn't.
Do them again.

17:11.330 --> 17:14.288
Okay, I get it.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.581
God, what's with you?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.722
A veterinarian, Kate?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.988
How long before you
tell him the truth.

17:20.030 --> 17:22.294
You got your secrets,
same as I do.

17:22.340 --> 17:25.514
I'm not the one telling
bald-faced lies to someone
who loves me.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.085
He doesn't even know
your real name.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.860
You told me if I stayed
here, life would be normal.

17:30.910 --> 17:31.956
That's all I want.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.048
And build a normal
life on lies?

17:34.090 --> 17:36.217
What do you want me to tell him?

17:36.270 --> 17:38.397
That my father was a
crazy street preacher

17:38.440 --> 17:39.748
who died in an alley?

17:39.790 --> 17:43.703
Well at least that would
be the truth, Kate.

17:45.190 --> 17:49.798
I'm trying to tell
a new story here.

17:49.850 --> 17:51.750
Starting now.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.621
And nobody's going to stop me.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.329
Lorna - Ladies!

17:56.370 --> 17:58.452
Something wrong?

17:58.510 --> 18:00.978
No.

18:01.030 --> 18:02.588
No problem here.

18:04.860 --> 18:08.125
So you think bringing oranges
like that is going to make her

18:08.170 --> 18:09.649
forget what you
people did?

18:09.690 --> 18:12.773
It's common decency, Marco.

18:12.830 --> 18:17.654
Yourhand?
What were you up to last night?

18:17.700 --> 18:20.009
I boxed a few rounds
at the gym.

18:20.050 --> 18:22.132
Bare knuckle?

18:22.180 --> 18:24.353
What's it to you?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.664
Nothing.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.209
I don't have much time,
Miss Witham.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.036
The Witham Foods truck robbery?

18:50.080 --> 18:51.684
I think Marco was involved.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.869
His knuckles, they're
bruised and cut.

18:53.910 --> 18:55.605
He was in a fight.

18:55.650 --> 18:57.436
And he was with
Frankie DiCarlo.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.436
Is that everything?

18:59.480 --> 19:00.731
What more do you need?

19:00.790 --> 19:03.611
This man DiCarlo he's
behind it. Detain him.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.833
DiCarlo is an amateur fascist.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.223
We are after the
head of the snake.

19:08.270 --> 19:09.965
There's talk he's
recruItIng locally,

19:10.010 --> 19:12.752
going into disaffected
communities.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.713
Have you any indication
Moretti's been approached?

19:16.760 --> 19:20.719
[Foot steps]

19:33.730 --> 19:36.608
The coast appears
to be clear.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.129
Sorry.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.161
It was all I could think of.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.471
Not a worry.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.602
It's all I could
think of too.

19:46.050 --> 19:48.655
So, Moretti.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.134
Has he been recruited?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.441
No.

19:53.930 --> 19:54.965
I don't know.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.239
This war,

19:59.280 --> 20:02.534
will be won or_ lost _on the
quaIIty of our Inte||Igence.

20:02.590 --> 20:05.150
The SS Caribou was sunk
because intelligence failed

20:05.200 --> 20:06.895
to track U-boat movements.

20:06.940 --> 20:09.579
If you want to stop women
and children dying,

20:09.640 --> 20:11.335
do your job.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.298
[Speaking Italian]

20:23.350 --> 20:26.956
So this is suppose to make it
right, giving the food away?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.468
They take it home to
their Nonnas.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.221
Hey, Mama Moretti!

20:34.270 --> 20:37.319
[Speaking Italian]

20:37.360 --> 20:39.885
All right, fellows. Bad idea.

20:39.930 --> 20:41.704
[Speaking Italian]

20:41.760 --> 20:44.979
I take care of this family.
What more do you want?

20:45.020 --> 20:48.751
At the store they call me thief;
is a lie I no theif.

20:48.810 --> 20:53.588
But you, you're a theif.
I'm ashamed.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.243
You're ashamed?

20:54.290 --> 20:55.154
Si.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.199
We're being treated like dogs!

20:56.250 --> 20:58.070
Easy Marco, that's your mother.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.169
I can barely walk the streets
with my head up.

21:01.210 --> 21:02.723
I no raise you for this.

21:02.780 --> 21:05.510
Who started the fight here?
Not me.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.256
Ya, kick the dog long enough,
he bites.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.706
She doesn't understand.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.832
She's ready for the
boot at any time.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.576
Probably still has the belt
around her suitcase.

21:22.620 --> 21:24.531
This is our country too.

21:24.580 --> 21:27.845
It's time they treat us
with respect.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.018
he wants to meet you.

21:32.070 --> 21:34.197
Oh yeah?
Who's that?

21:34.240 --> 21:36.060
Someone who thinks like us.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.062
Not tonight.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.549
Of course.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.249
Just say the word.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.047
Where's the Happy Gang?

22:00.100 --> 22:01.522
No one showed.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.740
Kids these days.

22:02.790 --> 22:05.702
All they want to dance
is the jitterbug.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.799
Shame. Had some
great tunes lIned up.

22:08.840 --> 22:12.321
You still have one student.

22:12.370 --> 22:15.976
You know, no sense letting all
that great music go to waste.

22:16.030 --> 22:20.148
If it's music you want,
I can take you to a
great little band.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.065
Drag a hoof?

22:24.210 --> 22:26.633
That was out of line,
didn't mean to push.

22:26.690 --> 22:28.555
No no, that's fine.

22:30.610 --> 22:31.736
Yeah.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.917
No harm in a firm lead.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.631
Come on, let's show 'em.

23:11.430 --> 23:14.035
Barman? Two of the same.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.128
Why do you bother
with me Gladys?

23:16.170 --> 23:17.956
You're a good guy, Marco.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.308
We're friends.

23:19.350 --> 23:21.477
We're playing different
ball-games.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.179
Hell, we're in completely
different leagues.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.562
We both live at home.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.133
Both under our mothers' thumbs.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.523
We have more in common
than you think.

23:28.580 --> 23:31.743
Maybe it's time
we both grow up.

23:37.670 --> 23:40.628
I know you've been going
through a rough time lately.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.671
Keep your head on straight.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.450
Don't do anything stupid.

23:45.510 --> 23:49.549
I'm supposed to be running my
father's company right now.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.500
You got bitter.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.151
No.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.773
I got smarter.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.168
Salute.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.226
When I saw Fred Astaire
In Swmg TIme,

24:11.270 --> 24:13.056
I tried the same moves.

24:13.100 --> 24:17.571
Leapt over a fence,
fell flat on my face!

24:17.630 --> 24:19.700
I forgot how much
I love dancing.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.921
Does a body good.

24:21.980 --> 24:23.538
And a heart.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.893
I'm sure she wanted
you to move on.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.759
Gracie? Never.

24:35.820 --> 24:39.426
Heck, wouldn't let me even
take a twirl with her sister.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.958
Your husband,
being in the chair...

24:47.000 --> 24:52.267
I guess he couldn't
begrudge you a dance.

24:52.310 --> 24:54.130
I never much wanted to.

24:54.180 --> 24:56.319
Except now he's out of town.

25:00.190 --> 25:01.407
A rough patch?

25:01.450 --> 25:02.701
No.

25:05.850 --> 25:09.149
Well. I don't know.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.374
Gracie and me never
spent a day apart.

25:12.420 --> 25:15.674
But then again everybody's
different, right?

25:15.730 --> 25:19.245
With Bob out of town,
I'm at loose ends.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.337
Seems we're tying up a few.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.258
Once this baby
runs in the paper,

25:30.310 --> 25:31.436
we are good as married.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.209
And that's fine by me.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.953
How about you?

25:35.010 --> 25:37.092
What do you mean?

25:37.140 --> 25:39.574
Means I made you a
promise, Katie.

25:39.620 --> 25:41.929
Means we're good to go.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.983
You and Marco,

25:59.030 --> 26:00.986
What gives?

26:01.030 --> 26:03.021
What are you talking about?

26:03.080 --> 26:05.423
Gladys, I saw the
two of you together.

26:05.470 --> 26:06.596
I bought him a drink.

26:06.650 --> 26:07.685
That's all it takes.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.605
It's not like that.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.562
You weren't even interested
in him until I told you I
had feelings.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.339
No, Vera.

26:14.390 --> 26:16.529
Give me one good reason
why you're spending time
with him like this?

26:16.570 --> 26:19.698
I'm worried about him.
I think he's in trouble.

26:19.750 --> 26:20.648
"Trouble".

26:20.700 --> 26:22.611
Yes.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.616
What kind of trouble?

26:24.670 --> 26:27.537
Hmmm... I don't...

26:27.580 --> 26:30.572
Boy, you're no good at this.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.540
Look at those stars.

26:37.590 --> 26:41.412
Lovely isn't it?

26:41.460 --> 26:45.339
And to think how few of
us ever really see them.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.205
You have a touch of the dreamer.

26:51.260 --> 26:52.682
Wish I had your passion.

26:54.910 --> 26:59.529
I meant while
you're danCIng.

26:59.570 --> 27:01.390
You do it so well.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.692
You must have something,

27:03.750 --> 27:05.354
makes you forget your troubles.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.406
When I'm cooking.

27:09.450 --> 27:11.702
I can take a bunch of
hodge—podge things

27:11.760 --> 27:13.409
and make them into
something beautiful.

27:13.450 --> 27:16.010
Sounds like a passion to me.

Sometimes

28:35.530 --> 28:39.569
you just need something
to hold on to.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.531
Is that all I am to you?

Hey.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.525

29:18.580 --> 29:23.574
Nobody ever talks about
what happened to you.

29:23.630 --> 29:25.575
I don't feel anything.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.324
What about here?

29:34.810 --> 29:35.856
Don't.

Boy, that girl Cathy's in

30:27.950 --> 30:30.123
It's a card from Bob.

30:30.170 --> 30:32.035
Are those the Northern Lights?

30:32.090 --> 30:35.082
We saw them once,
over the Georgian Bay.

Nobody.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.103
I heard you, Marco.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.021
It's none of your business.

What, have you've got
some big secret?

31:54.470 --> 31:56.609
I don't want to
talk about this.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.686
Marco, you're hiding something.

understand...

but I don't believe God
put us here, any of us,

So, what do we do now?

38:29.390 --> 38:30.869
Nothing.

38:30.910 --> 38:33.515
You told me this was
all for his protection,

38:33.570 --> 38:34.992
that we'd help him.

38:40.790 --> 38:43.520

I doubt you have a friend.
