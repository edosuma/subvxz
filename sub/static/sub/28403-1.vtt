keep yourself smoked out,
I get it.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.699
But where is your ambition?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.702

17:42.595 --> 17:44.228
It's about the power.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.800
Power.

17:48.802 --> 17:53.104
...is in simplest terms,
normlessness.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.206
Take cellphones.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.141
They're a contemporary
invention

17:57.143 --> 18:01.245
and the social norms
haven't been established yet.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.549
Anomie is a new road
without stoplights.

18:04.551 --> 18:08.019

there's bound to be
some accidents.

18:21.301 --> 18:25.470
Shit. I'll wife you.
You just gotta say
a word for it.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.839

I'm a joke to you?

18:27.841 --> 18:30.141
No. You're my best friend.

-Okay.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.214
Thank you. Just...

18:36.216 --> 18:37.915

like that, please.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.450

19:12.852 --> 19:15.186
So what, are you trying
to go pro or something?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.589
Just tired of being
passive, man.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.759
Tired of waiting.

19:21.761 --> 19:25.329

19:30.170 --> 19:31.969
What'd I graduate
high school for?

19:31.971 --> 19:34.539
Well, because people told me
it was the fastest way out,
and I believed 'em.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.009
But I'm still right here.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.245

1:33:27.769 --> 1:33:30.904
<i> For me the sweet-heart</i>
