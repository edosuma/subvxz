All: Yeah!

16:45.709 --> 16:47.750

16:47.792 --> 16:51.125
there's enough room.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.750

Volley for serve!

16:54.125 --> 16:57.166
Ow!

16:57.208 --> 16:58.709
It's all good, everyone.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.166
Not a party till someone

16:58.750 --> 17:01.166
gets hit in the face.

17:01.208 --> 17:02.834
- Not cool, Dawn.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.458

The extreme fun

17:50.750 --> 17:53.500
is right this way.

17:54.959 --> 17:58.041
Okay, who's first

17:54.959 --> 17:58.041
in the skydiving simulator?

17:58.083 --> 17:59.333
- No way.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.083
You spent 45 minutes

17:59.375 --> 18:01.083
explaining

18:01.125 --> 18:04.458
all the ways you might get

18:01.125 --> 18:04.458

- Yeah, I miss when you guys

18:30.875 --> 18:33.917
used to have one big fun party.

18:36.709 --> 18:38.792
- It's all been leading up

18:36.709 --> 18:38.792
to this, Tom.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.709
This is not a drill.

19:04.375 --> 19:07.125
the Quadfather.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.375
- Actually, no.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.375
Not this year.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.500
- But the Quadfather's

19:09.417 --> 19:11.500
the best part.

19:11.542 --> 19:12.750
All: Yeah.

19:40.417 --> 19:43.458
- Yeah. But who cares?

19:40.417 --> 19:43.458
It's still fun.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.750

Worst party ever, Harpers.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.333

20:22.667 --> 20:24.083
- They're right.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.667
I guess we should blow out

20:24.125 --> 20:25.667
our candles.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.792
- What should we wish for?

20:28.834 --> 20:31.500
- I wish we still believed

20:28.834 --> 20:31.500
in the Quadfather.
