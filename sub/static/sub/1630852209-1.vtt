00:01.634 --> 00:03.202
<i>- [Craig] Lynx kittens are one of the cutest things around.
- [woman] I know, baby.</i>

00:03.236 --> 00:05.871
<i>[Craig] Then they've learned that
they don't want to be picked up.</i>

00:05.905 --> 00:07.072
[kitten screeches]

00:08.174 --> 00:09.174
[woman] Mo-mom!

00:09.209 --> 00:11.110
<i>[Donna] We're gonna have to
separate Mom now</i>

00:11.144 --> 00:12.811
<i>so that we can
safely dart this calf.</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:14.279
[grunts]

00:14.581 --> 00:18.250
<i>[Brenda] Trying to separate a
mom and her calf is very hard.</i>

00:18.284 --> 00:19.418
[man] Close it a little.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.054
You can do it.
Come on.

00:22.989 --> 00:26.125
<i>Our exhibit shop is gonna
create a fabulous new exhibit</i>

00:26.159 --> 00:28.260
<i>for our Ethiopian
mountain vipers.</i>

00:28.294 --> 00:30.229
<i>There's a little bit
of a drain sticking out</i>

00:30.263 --> 00:32.931
so you don't want to
hit that in any way.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.000
[male staffs] One, two, three!

00:35.035 --> 00:36.835
[male staff] You got it?

00:36.869 --> 00:40.239
[Pat] Nadia, one of our Malayan
tigers developed a cough.

00:40.273 --> 00:45.277
The veterinarians assured us that it was
not COVID-19. It couldn't be COVID-19.

00:48.314 --> 00:51.116
<i>[Jim] If you ask a child
to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:51.151 --> 00:54.820
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:54.854 --> 00:57.322
We have got to take that image
and change it.

00:57.824 --> 00:58.991
They really enjoy this.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.593
It strengthens the bond
that we have with these guys.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.596
[man] Come on. I know,
you don't like doors.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.432
[woman] Come on, ladies.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.501
<i>[Jim] It's not enough to keep animals
in exhibits just for people to look at.</i>

01:09.536 --> 01:11.203
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

01:11.237 --> 01:14.606
<i>And for us, it's conservation
of species in the wild.</i>

01:14.641 --> 01:16.208
[man] Are we rolling?

01:16.210 --> 01:19.111
<i>The general public would never
get the access you're going to get...</i>

01:19.145 --> 01:20.979
- [woman] Such a good girl.
<i>- [Jim] ...w hich is to see</i>

01:21.014 --> 01:24.249
<i>what goes on
behind the scenes everyday.</i>

01:24.284 --> 01:26.118
It's how we do it here
in the Boogie Down Bronx.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.519
[all laughing]

01:32.959 --> 01:36.929
<i>[Jim] This is our second
full week of being open.</i>

01:36.963 --> 01:38.897
<i>At first glance,
it looks pretty normal</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:42.768
<i>for a really warm afternoon
here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

01:42.802 --> 01:45.137
<i>But if you look closely, you'll
see everybody wearing masks</i>

01:45.171 --> 01:47.973
<i>and you realize
it's a new reality.</i>

01:54.013 --> 01:57.516
I've been at the Bronx Zoo
for a long time

01:57.550 --> 02:01.887
and the only time in
recent history the zoo closed

02:01.921 --> 02:07.960
that was not due to a weather
event was the week of 9/11.

02:07.994 --> 02:11.964
<i>[reporter] New York state and New
York City, all non-essential businesses</i>

02:11.998 --> 02:14.199
<i>closed their doors
three hours ago</i>

02:14.234 --> 02:17.703
<i>as the state goes on pause
to fight coronavirus.</i>

02:17.737 --> 02:19.238
<i>[Jim] We were the epicenter.</i>

02:19.272 --> 02:22.174
<i>People all around the nation
and all around the world</i>

02:22.208 --> 02:25.677
were looking at New York to
see how we were gonna respond,

02:25.712 --> 02:27.346
how we were gonna
come out of it.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.550
<i>We had a FEMA site for
where the ambulances,</i>

02:31.584 --> 02:33.819
<i>250 ambulances were based here.</i>

02:33.853 --> 02:35.787
<i>We had one of the
local hospitals</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:39.758
<i>do a drive-through
COVID testing site.</i>

02:39.792 --> 02:44.062
I mean, we see ourselves as part
of this community and part of the city,

02:44.097 --> 02:46.198
and wanted to do
whatever we could

02:46.232 --> 02:50.335
to contribute to all of us
getting through this.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.539
<i>[Kathleen] Our world changed
quite a bit.</i>

02:53.573 --> 02:55.174
<i>We had to close down the zoo.</i>

02:55.208 --> 02:57.109
I never thought
that would happen.

02:57.143 --> 02:59.144
[seals barking]

03:00.213 --> 03:02.414
<i>[Jim] We were in crisis mode,
trying to make sure</i>

03:02.448 --> 03:05.517
<i>that we could meet our
commitments to the animals in our care.</i>

03:05.552 --> 03:08.554
<i>And also meet our commitment
to the staff, the essential staff</i>

03:08.588 --> 03:12.558
<i>that were required to come
in to care for the animals.</i>

03:12.592 --> 03:13.959
[woman] Good girl.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.829
During the time we were closed,

03:17.864 --> 03:22.568
Nadia, one of our female
Malayan tigers developed a cough.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.872
[Jim] The veterinarian assured
us that it was not COVID-19.

03:26.906 --> 03:30.142
It couldn't be COVID-19.
It wouldn't be COVID-19.

03:30.176 --> 03:33.879
Today we are hearing from the
chief veterinarian at the Bronx Zoo

03:33.913 --> 03:38.417
after a tiger there
tested positive for COVID-19.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.788
<i>[Jim] In all, we had
eight big cats test positive.</i>

03:42.822 --> 03:46.925
<i>Five of the tigers
and three of our lions.</i>

03:46.960 --> 03:50.028
After we got the results <i>back,
it became obvious that people</i>

03:50.063 --> 03:53.565
<i>could transmit the virus
to the big cats.</i>

03:53.600 --> 03:57.536
The cats who were infected
were infected by people

03:57.570 --> 04:01.073
who were caring for them,
who were asymptomatic.

04:01.107 --> 04:05.744
<i>So we immediately put in PPE
protocol on working with the big cats.</i>

04:05.778 --> 04:09.147
The zoo and aquarium community
is a tight-knit community

04:09.182 --> 04:13.318
<i>and we all have a responsibility
to disseminate information.</i>

04:13.353 --> 04:14.519
[woman] Good!

04:14.554 --> 04:17.289
<i>[Jim] So as soon as that
information went out</i>

04:17.323 --> 04:20.759
then all the zoos in this country
and zoos around the world

04:20.793 --> 04:24.162
put in similar protocol
to what we did here.

04:24.197 --> 04:29.901
And Nadia, it was amazing how
quickly her symptoms was subsided

04:29.936 --> 04:32.104
and now she's fine.

04:32.138 --> 04:35.107
<i>I mean, you can't tell if there's
ever anything wrong with her.</i>

04:35.908 --> 04:38.343
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

04:39.012 --> 04:42.147
<i>As far as the rest of the cats
that tested positive,</i>

04:42.181 --> 04:46.051
<i>it just kind of passed, they recovered
on their own in a short amount of time,</i>

04:46.085 --> 04:48.120
<i>and now they're all
completely resolved.</i>

04:51.791 --> 04:53.025
[man] Hey, sweetie.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.796
[girl] They look like bears.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.632
<i>[Jim] This whole experience
has just reinforced</i>

05:00.667 --> 05:03.101
<i>how important the zoo is
in the community</i>

05:03.135 --> 05:05.871
<i>and what an important role
the zoo provides</i>

05:05.905 --> 05:08.774
<i>in providing people
with a nature retreat</i>

05:08.808 --> 05:11.276
<i>where they can go
to get away from everything.</i>

05:11.310 --> 05:16.181
We always talk about the
importance of soft green spaces.

05:16.215 --> 05:19.084
A respite where people
can come and relax

05:19.118 --> 05:21.720
and get away from
the harshness of the city.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.890
<i>People are so happy to be able
to get out of their houses now</i>

05:24.924 --> 05:27.259
and to do things
with their families again.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.529
[woman] He's looking at you.
[laughs]

05:35.968 --> 05:37.436
[grunts]

05:38.805 --> 05:40.372
[man] See, there's the momma.
Do you see the baby?

05:40.406 --> 05:44.109
- [kid] ...the baby.
- [man] Right there. Do you see the baby in the back?

05:44.143 --> 05:47.145
[Dr. Sykes] Do you want me to back it down
now or do you want me to leave it here?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.613
[speaking]

05:51.250 --> 05:52.851
Sure.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.986
- [man] We're just gonna try and get him in the back?
- [Brenda] Yeah.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.956
I don't know if she'll go back
but we'll see, hopefully.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.324
Good girl.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.892
-[woman] That's her right there.
-[Brenda] Yeah.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.094
Okay.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.863
<i>[Brenda] We had a bison calf
born three months ago.</i>

06:04.897 --> 06:07.733
<i>Her name is L2,
which is her ear tag.</i>

06:07.767 --> 06:09.901
<i>We use that
to identify the animals.</i>

06:09.936 --> 06:12.170
And we noticed
a few days after birth

06:12.205 --> 06:16.608
that she had
a severely bowed front leg.

06:16.809 --> 06:19.811
It's kind of hard to tell, but if
you look a little bit more closely

06:19.846 --> 06:22.147
you can see how the joint
is sticking out to the side,

06:22.181 --> 06:23.949
and that was the problem
when she was born.

06:23.983 --> 06:27.919
Her leg is going out like this
instead of staying forward.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.956
<i>[Brenda] T he doctors here
thought that it might correct itself</i>

06:30.990 --> 06:33.091
<i>with a little bit of time</i>

06:33.126 --> 06:36.962
but after a few days passed, we
realized it wasn't getting any better.

06:36.996 --> 06:39.731
<i>The fact that she is
bow-legged now isn't so dramatic.</i>

06:39.766 --> 06:42.834
<i>It's when she gets older
and she becomes heavier...</i>

06:42.869 --> 06:49.174
Having over a thousand pounds put on to legs
like that could be severely problematic.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.812
- [man] She's right there.
- [Nicole] Yeah, right there.

06:53.846 --> 06:57.182
<i>[Pat] L2 is note-worthy
because she's a pure bison.</i>

06:57.216 --> 06:59.818
<i>When bison were literally
on the brink of extinction,</i>

06:59.852 --> 07:04.055
ranchers tried breeding
bison with domestic cattle

07:04.090 --> 07:10.095
<i>and it's only these roughly 6000
bison that are still genetically pure</i>

07:10.129 --> 07:12.597
where their genes are
pure bison genes.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.066
Mom!

07:16.502 --> 07:20.572
<i>[Donna] We are gonna have to separate Mom
now so that we can safely dart this calf.</i>

07:20.606 --> 07:23.975
<i>She has gotten too big that we
can't just do a hand grab on her.</i>

07:24.010 --> 07:28.246
And then we're gonna plan to bring her
up to the hospital for surgical procedure.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.081
Mo-mom!

07:30.116 --> 07:31.883
[man] Start to open it
a little bit.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.454
<i>[Brenda] Trying to separate a
mom and her calf is very hard,</i>

07:35.488 --> 07:38.523
because they are very much
bonded together.

07:38.558 --> 07:41.960
<i>You're gonna try to creep a
door so that it's not very wide,</i>

07:41.994 --> 07:45.764
<i>and the calf will go through
but the mother can't fit.</i>

07:45.798 --> 07:47.232
[man] Stop.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.138
-Come on, kiddo. You can do it. Come on.
-[bison grunts]

07:54.040 --> 07:57.275
[man] Close a little.
Little more. Stop.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.380
All right. Open a little bit.

08:03.749 --> 08:04.983
That's good.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.490
-[Pat] Close it
-Close it.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.558
- [Pat] Nice.
- [Brenda] Good job.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.695
- [Dr. Sykes] Okay. You ready?
- Yeah.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.097
<i>[Dr. Sykes] The surgery that
we are looking at is pretty minor.</i>

08:19.131 --> 08:21.766
We're gonna put a screw
across a growth plate

08:21.801 --> 08:25.136
<i>that'll slow one side down
and let the other side catch up.</i>

08:25.171 --> 08:28.840
And as her legs straightens
out, we'll take the screw out

08:28.875 --> 08:30.575
and hopefully they'll
grow together again.

08:30.610 --> 08:34.479
[Pat] On three.
One-two-three.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.082
<i>[Dr. Sykes] And we hope that as
soon as we are done with surgery,</i>

08:37.116 --> 08:40.185
<i>she goes back with Mom. She and
Mom both go back with the group,</i>

08:40.219 --> 08:43.054
and she'll keep running around
with the herd as normal.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.390
- [Brenda] Head first.
- [male staff] Head first would be helpful.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.604
[woman] What are they doing
with their wings?

08:59.872 --> 09:02.073
[woman] The eagles are
right there. Look how he walks.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.275
[child] This is fun.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.945
[man speaking]

09:06.979 --> 09:07.979
[Craig] Oh, they're gonna be
tough.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.481
[woman] Why do I
have to come do it

09:09.515 --> 09:12.050
when they're no longer
cute and cuddly? [laughs]

09:12.952 --> 09:17.022
We've had lynx at the Queens
Zoo for quite a while now.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.924
<i>[Craig] Our male, Mercury,
came from Winnipeg.</i>

09:18.958 --> 09:21.593
<i>And he's been here
for about eight years.</i>

09:21.661 --> 09:25.931
<i>Daisy came to us about four
years ago from the Minnesota Zoo.</i>

09:25.965 --> 09:27.966
<i>They are in a species
survival program</i>

09:28.000 --> 09:31.536
and this is their
first successful litter.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.806
<i>[Craig] We have three kittens.
We have one male and two females.</i>

09:34.840 --> 09:38.577
It's very exciting. Lynx kittens
are one of the cutest things around.

09:38.611 --> 09:42.681
Our caravan of people is off
to vaccinate the Lynx kittens

09:42.715 --> 09:48.520
for rabies and canine
distemper and feline distemper.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.957
- We'll see.
- [Susie] Famous last words.

09:51.991 --> 09:56.094
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Everybody went in the box, I guess?

09:56.128 --> 09:57.996
Yeah, that's what it seems like.

09:58.030 --> 10:02.968
[Susie] Hello, I know.
You're all mad at me? Easy.

10:03.002 --> 10:06.204
- I'll wipe the sweat off your forehead.
- Push it back.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.808
Hey, stop it.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.943
- Feisty.
- I know, you're not kidding.

10:11.978 --> 10:15.046
[Craig] The kittens,
they're turning into lynx.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.916
And they've learned that
they don't want to be picked up.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.150
[Susie] It's okay.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.353
They're little balls of fury.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.589
[Lynx shrieking]

10:27.126 --> 10:29.227
- [Susie] Mom's upset.
- [Craig] That's mama.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.898
- [Susie] Sorry, sweetie.
- [Craig] So we're good?

10:33.933 --> 10:35.266
Yep.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.738
[Raul] Just like human babies,
no one likes getting vaccinated.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.607
Aw jeez. Be cool, man.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.410
But they're responding, it's exactly
the way we thought they would.

10:45.444 --> 10:48.146
<i>They're very feisty,
they're hard to catch up.</i>

10:51.684 --> 10:53.251
It's okay.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.154
<i>[Raul] They're turning
into lynx.</i>

10:58.057 --> 11:01.426
[Susie] We have one left.
Raul said you were the sweetie.

11:03.529 --> 11:05.397
Don' make mom mad.

11:05.431 --> 11:08.166
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold on.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.935
Great.

11:11.804 --> 11:15.040
<i>[Raul] This is the last round
of vaccines.</i>

11:15.074 --> 11:18.476
Now that they're vaccinated, pretty
soon hopefully, they can go out on exhibit.

11:19.945 --> 11:24.549
-Beautiful.
-Watch your back, Susie. She's eyeing you, eyeing you.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.384
[Raul] She'll seek revenge
for her siblings.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.186
[Susie] Job well done.

11:31.157 --> 11:34.993
[Brenda] If too much time passes, you
could have that possibility of a mother

11:35.027 --> 11:36.561
rejecting her calf.

11:36.595 --> 11:38.463
- Go ahead. Reunite them.
- We good?

11:46.839 --> 11:49.374
[kid] Hey there, turtle.
What you eating?

11:54.046 --> 11:56.281
All right. Cool.
Those aren't mine.

11:57.183 --> 11:58.983
These are.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.022
We're going to feed our
Ethiopian mountain vipers.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.558
There's one snake right here
propped up in front.

12:06.592 --> 12:10.595
The second one is tucked
behind that front log right there.

12:10.629 --> 12:15.500
The Ethiopian mountain <i>viper is a unique
species because it was only recently discovered.</i>

12:15.534 --> 12:22.006
It was identified in the late 1970s and
only found in one rift valley in Ethiopia.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.009
<i>This particular valley is under
pressure from deforestation</i>

12:25.044 --> 12:27.545
and we don't really know
how many are left in the wild.

12:32.151 --> 12:34.018
That was a successful strike.

12:34.052 --> 12:36.955
It happened so quick, I mean
these snakes are ambush predators.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.591
They'll have that initial
strike, deliver the venom

12:39.625 --> 12:43.294
and now the snake's kinda just
looking at the rodent, tongue flicking and

12:43.329 --> 12:47.065
once he believes that it's dead,
he'll go ahead and consume it.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.533
Down the hatch.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.669
[Andrew] We currently have
four new exhibits

12:51.704 --> 12:53.004
being constructed
at the Reptile house

12:53.038 --> 12:56.708
for a number of snakes,
lizards and frog species.

12:56.742 --> 13:00.512
We're behind the scenes at
south-east quarter in the reptile house.

13:00.546 --> 13:05.517
We're in the service area and on the
other side there's the Reptile house lobby.

13:05.551 --> 13:10.088
We're in the process of renovating
a few exhibits in this section.

13:10.122 --> 13:16.027
We're replacing this with a new
exhibit for the Ethiopian mountain vipers.

13:16.061 --> 13:20.498
The current exhibit we have the
vipers in is planted up with live plants

13:20.533 --> 13:23.101
and it's got a nice
air-brushed background on it.

13:23.169 --> 13:27.071
But it doesn't really have the three-dimensional
relief that the new exhibit will have.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.641
It'll be a slightly larger
exhibit for them.

13:29.675 --> 13:32.877
But it'll also be a
micro-slice of their habitat.

13:32.912 --> 13:37.415
They live in a mossy cool forest and
that's what we're going to create for them.

13:43.189 --> 13:47.759
I've been working on the Ethiopian
mountain viper exhibit for about 8 months.

13:47.793 --> 13:50.829
The keeper, he explains
the basic habitat to me.

13:50.863 --> 13:55.233
They need these many branches,
this height, this much water

13:55.267 --> 13:57.702
and then I do some research
on my own

13:57.736 --> 14:00.572
just to see if there are
little extras I can add in.

14:00.606 --> 14:05.443
If you looked at it, you would think
this is a little snapshot of the habitat.

14:05.477 --> 14:08.246
This is a model I made
for this exhibit.

14:08.280 --> 14:13.084
Then I basically took a scale, a ruler, made
some drawings and scaled it up to full size.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.853
This exhibit I did all by hand.

14:14.887 --> 14:18.890
We carve it out of foam,
we skin it with fiber glass,

14:18.924 --> 14:22.627
and then we put a layer of sculpting
epoxy over it for all the details

14:22.661 --> 14:26.564
of the bark and the mud banks
and thigs like that.

14:26.599 --> 14:32.804
I made two waterfalls. One travels
down here, goes into this pool back here.

14:32.838 --> 14:35.073
And one is plumbed
through this branch

14:35.107 --> 14:39.510
and will come out and slowly
sort of drip into the pool here.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.314
This exhibit, once it's done,
I'll demolish the old exhibit.

14:43.349 --> 14:49.587
We just put on a lot of protective
equipment and get a sledgehammer and just

14:49.622 --> 14:52.390
take it out. Any way you can.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.035
[man] Spin her around if we could, please,
spin her around and head the other way.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.436
There we go.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.775
How long would you
leave it in for?

15:10.809 --> 15:13.845
We're going to look at this
every three or four days

15:13.879 --> 15:19.017
and as soon as this gets to about
80% of the way there, you take it out.

15:19.051 --> 15:24.289
We're working with an equine surgeon
who does this kind of surgery all the time.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.525
The surgical site is just
a little bit above the staple.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.161
So, right about there.

15:30.195 --> 15:35.033
The bison calf, L2's bone is
not growing at the same speed

15:35.067 --> 15:38.336
on both the inside of her bone
and the outside of her bone.

15:38.370 --> 15:43.942
What we're planning to do for L2 is
to put a screw on one side of her bone

15:43.976 --> 15:48.746
and that screw actually kind of
slows down the growth on that side

15:48.781 --> 15:53.718
and it'll give the other side a chance
to catch up, let her bone get straight.

15:53.752 --> 15:58.389
And then we'll take the screw out, and they
can grow out together at the same rate.

15:58.424 --> 16:02.927
As you see how quickly it's
correcting, you'd be able to anticipate

16:02.961 --> 16:08.166
Right, it'll be obvious on the growth
spurts and I'm not sure how, when...

16:08.200 --> 16:11.135
- I don't have a good sense of how bison grow but you do.
- Fast.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.104
Yeah.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.310
- Okay for us to go?
- Yes, please.

16:19.344 --> 16:24.382
- Yes please like get this done be quiet?
- No, no, no, please go ahead.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.952
- Ready?
- Yep.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.388
[drilling]

16:34.860 --> 16:38.963
So, I'm not gonna tighten it the whole
way yet. They can look over there.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.765
John, can we take another X-Ray?

16:40.799 --> 16:43.968
We want to make sure the
positioning's good and then we want to

16:44.003 --> 16:47.972
get the patient back to its normal
environment as quickly as we can.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.575
Okay, so that is
completely perfect.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.544
- Closing?
- Closing.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.283
Clean this up a little bit.

17:00.953 --> 17:06.324
- Okay, all set.
- Excellent. Thank you so much.

17:06.358 --> 17:11.396
It's important to get L2 back with
its mother as quickly as possible.

17:13.065 --> 17:18.569
If too much time passes, you could have that
possibility of a mother rejecting a calf.

17:18.837 --> 17:22.273
We want to avoid any kind
of problems like that.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.079
Here we go.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.934
- Excellent.
- We can go ahead.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.036
- We good?
- Reunite them.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.972
[grunting]

18:05.250 --> 18:06.584
Good.

18:06.685 --> 18:10.021
We'll continue to monitor L2
to make that her leg doesn't

18:10.055 --> 18:12.790
over-rotate which is
one of the concerns.

18:12.825 --> 18:17.261
We'll reintroduce the two animals
back with the herd and if all goes well

18:17.296 --> 18:20.898
tomorrow morning we'll put the
entire herd back out on exhibit.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.201
Okay. Thank you.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.241
[man] We're gonna start demolition
on some of our older exhibits.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.513
- [man speaking]
- No, really?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.190
[man] They're called bison.
Can you say bison?

18:46.225 --> 18:48.025
- Bison.
- Yay!

18:49.194 --> 18:51.062
- [woman 1] They're humongous.
- [woman 2] Yeah.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.030
Wow.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.638
I'm looking to see if
the joint has swollen at all.

19:00.672 --> 19:03.841
And if we can actually see
that the sutures are still there.

19:03.876 --> 19:08.079
It's the first day after surgery
and we'll take a good look at her leg

19:08.113 --> 19:12.783
and make sure that the incision site
looks good, that she's comfortable.

19:12.818 --> 19:17.088
She's happy with mom, and then
we'll let her go back into the herd.

19:20.025 --> 19:23.861
From here you can see
that the incision is closed.

19:23.896 --> 19:27.732
She looks like she's walking
well and her joint's not swollen.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.535
So I think she's good
to go back with everybody.

19:33.105 --> 19:36.007
Once they open that, they're gonna go
through the chute with everybody else.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.509
They're gonna be all
together out there.

19:39.745 --> 19:43.381
As quickly as we can get her
back, the happier she's gonna be

19:43.415 --> 19:47.285
and the happier she is
the more quickly she heals.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.961
[man speaking]

20:07.072 --> 20:10.808
[Brenda] The herd is very
bonded and they know that when

20:10.842 --> 20:13.311
animals are missing as soon as
you put them out there,

20:13.345 --> 20:15.613
they're looking to
reunite with them.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.481
It's a close-knit group.

20:19.051 --> 20:23.554
We'll try to get a weekly, you know,
really good look at the front of those legs

20:23.589 --> 20:25.957
so that we can decide when
the screw needs to come out.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.227
- She's doing good.
- Yep.

20:30.028 --> 20:32.230
- [woman] Sounds good. Thanks.
- [Sykes] Thank you.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.913
- Brittany, how are you doing?
- All right.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.081
We're gonna go into lynx now,

20:50.115 --> 20:52.416
we're gonna check
the exhibit out.

20:58.023 --> 20:59.790
[Brittany] This is the first day

20:59.825 --> 21:02.460
our lynx kittens are
going on exhibit.

21:04.830 --> 21:08.032
Just wanna make sure there are
no, like, gaps in the fencing,

21:08.066 --> 21:10.935
any escape hazards.
Just baby-proofing it.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.136
Ooh, spider web.

21:14.006 --> 21:17.375
<i>I love my job. I was
actually pre-med in college.</i>

21:17.409 --> 21:22.046
I really enjoyed my time
studying biology.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.781
<i>Especially studying
how different animals work</i>

21:23.815 --> 21:25.916
<i>and the different biologies
of them.</i>

21:25.951 --> 21:28.786
<i>I think that was what I was
most interested in.</i>

21:28.820 --> 21:30.554
Who thought
that I could get paid

21:30.589 --> 21:33.291
for being around animals
and taking care of them.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.393
So, jumped on that.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.429
[Raul] Looks good.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.898
<i>My brother and I, we grew up
right around the Bronx Zoo.</i>

21:40.932 --> 21:44.135
<i>Kind of an area for us to get
away from urban life.</i>

21:44.169 --> 21:47.338
We just became enamored
with nature and animals.

21:48.407 --> 21:51.609
And that's how we ended up
becoming zookeepers

21:53.078 --> 21:54.345
All right.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.414
So, I think we're pretty good.

21:57.182 --> 21:58.883
[Jim] Man, you got
a nice day for it.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.184
- [man 1] I know.
- [man 2] Yeah.

22:00.218 --> 22:01.819
Today I came to the Queens Zoo,

22:01.853 --> 22:03.554
'cause I heard they were
putting the lynx kittens

22:03.588 --> 22:05.022
out on exhibit
for the first time.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.091
All right.
We're all set on here.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.759
<i>[man on radio] Guys, pull
the gate whenever you want.</i>

22:08.794 --> 22:10.261
- [walkie-talkie beeps]
- Ten-four.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.266
<i>[Brittany] Four lynx are
ready for exibit.</i>

22:15.300 --> 22:17.234
Ten-four.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.503
We're hoping they all come out
and just start playing

22:19.538 --> 22:21.072
and running around,
but Daisy's gonna

22:21.106 --> 22:24.208
be suspicious at first, so,
not sure what's gonna happen.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.311
[indistinct chatter
in background]

22:53.872 --> 22:54.939
- That's Daisy?
- [Raul] Yup.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.074
- There she is.
- We got a cat.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.249
[Raul] See
if someone's following her

23:05.283 --> 23:07.351
or she'll call for the kittens.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.089
No, there she goes.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.924
I wonder if she's gonna
bring them out now.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.427
[Pat] Now we'll see
if she brings them out.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.965
They will take their cue
and their lead from their mom.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.300
You just have to work
on the animal's time.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.771
Here's the issue we have.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.539
Here's a picture
of the kittens right now.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.907
- [Pat] Okay.
- They're all sound asleep

23:29.941 --> 23:33.110
in the [chuckles] corner.

23:33.144 --> 23:34.879
[Raul] It seems she's not
quite comfortable yet

23:34.913 --> 23:37.815
bringing them out on to exhibit.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.050
There's certainly no urgency
for them to come out.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.620
So you want them
to be comfortable.

23:42.654 --> 23:45.322
[Brittany] They've got, like,
the world at their fingertips,

23:45.390 --> 23:47.491
and they're all, like,
just laying down together.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.026
Guys.

23:57.669 --> 24:02.206
[Carrie] The Ethiopian mountain
viper exhibit is completed, which is great.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.176
[Gary] That'll be really
exciting to get this in play.

24:05.210 --> 24:08.279
We build exhibits
from soup to nuts.

24:08.313 --> 24:09.980
<i>Carpentry, cement-work,</i>

24:10.015 --> 24:12.016
<i>electrical, plumbing.</i>

24:12.050 --> 24:14.185
<i>We have a tremendous amount
of real estate back here</i>

24:14.219 --> 24:15.953
<i>and nobody even knows
where we are.</i>

24:15.987 --> 24:18.155
So, it's great to have
that freedom

24:18.189 --> 24:20.758
<i>to express innovation.</i>

24:20.792 --> 24:24.862
It has all of the planters
we spoke about.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.865
There will be plants
cascading down everywhere,

24:27.899 --> 24:30.100
and it will just be
full of life.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.870
It incorporates
several water features.

24:32.904 --> 24:34.872
The water source is
up in this corner.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.273
It's all hidden.

24:36.908 --> 24:38.409
<i>[Gary] I've been here 35 years</i>

24:38.443 --> 24:41.212
<i>and what other artist can
come in everyday,</i>

24:41.246 --> 24:45.049
do something challenging
and different all the time.

24:45.951 --> 24:47.051
[Carrie] If you could
see through this

24:47.085 --> 24:48.686
with x-ray vision, you would see

24:48.720 --> 24:52.089
a lot of [laughs]
many mechanisms in here,

24:52.123 --> 24:55.025
lots of tubing,
different kinds of tubing.

24:55.059 --> 24:57.161
It's very important
that in the final analysis

24:57.195 --> 25:00.831
you can't see any
of... the mechanisms in here

25:00.866 --> 25:02.066
that are making it function.

25:02.100 --> 25:05.936
It should just look
like a natural environment.

25:05.971 --> 25:07.838
Have you weighed this thing?
Do you have any idea?

25:07.873 --> 25:09.206
No. [laughs]

25:09.241 --> 25:11.976
It's very heavy.
I can't lift it myself.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.711
Because the exhibits are
so heavy, we need

25:13.745 --> 25:15.246
<i>custom-made bases,</i>

25:15.280 --> 25:18.315
<i>both to sustain the weight
of the exhibit properly,</i>

25:18.350 --> 25:21.652
<i>and to be the correct height
for a pre-existing window</i>

25:21.686 --> 25:23.220
<i>in Reptile House.</i>

25:23.255 --> 25:25.456
So we couldn't really just
get one off the shelf.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.266
- [Carlos] It's good?
- [man] Yep.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.834
Excellent.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.970
[Carlos speaking]

25:43.008 --> 25:45.576
So, we are adjusting
the construction stages

25:45.610 --> 25:47.912
of this. We've just
cut the materials,

25:47.946 --> 25:51.148
and we're tacking and welding
the top frame for that table.

25:51.182 --> 25:52.917
Drop it right over here?

25:52.951 --> 25:55.052
Yeah. You're gonna put
one, one, one.

25:55.086 --> 25:58.956
- Make yourself comfortable.
- I'm a maintainer here at the Bronx Zoo.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.758
<i>I've been in the shops
for one year now.</i>

26:00.792 --> 26:02.893
<i>It's honestly the best job
I've ever had.</i>

26:02.928 --> 26:06.030
The guys I work with,
they got years of experience.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.198
<i>They've been working here
for a long time.</i>

26:08.233 --> 26:09.266
<i>You know, some
of them over 20 years.</i>

26:09.301 --> 26:11.168
<i>So they know the park
better than anyone.</i>

26:11.202 --> 26:13.571
So, just learning
from them, it's great.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.008
[Carlos] Right now,
we are just making sure

26:18.043 --> 26:20.210
that this is square,
that it is straight.

26:21.746 --> 26:25.149
All right. Nice. Beautiful.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.084
<i>[Eric] It's really cool
you're making these things</i>

26:27.118 --> 26:29.987
so these reptiles can
be comfortable, you know?

26:30.021 --> 26:31.956
And everything we do is
for the animals.

26:34.225 --> 26:35.993
[Carlos] All right. Nice.

26:36.027 --> 26:38.128
[man] It literally is
like herding cat.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.663
[chuckling] She really
doesn't know where to go

26:39.698 --> 26:41.031
or what to look at.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.434
I can definitely relate
to how stressful it can be.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.239
[seals barking]

26:50.609 --> 26:52.977
- Look at that.
- [woman] Wow, right?

26:54.245 --> 26:56.547
[rain pattering]

26:59.017 --> 27:01.051
- [Sykes] We'd like to go look at her.
- Okay.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.152
<i>[Sykes] It's been
about two months</i>

27:02.187 --> 27:05.889
<i>since we put the screw
into L-2's leg.</i>

27:05.924 --> 27:09.927
<i>Dr. Cook is here to take
a look at how the leg looks,</i>

27:09.961 --> 27:11.228
<i>and if we agree
that it still looks</i>

27:11.262 --> 27:12.796
<i>really good and straight,</i>

27:12.831 --> 27:14.031
then we'll go ahead with surgery

27:14.065 --> 27:15.666
and remove the screw.

27:15.700 --> 27:16.867
<i>A lot of times I've found, like,</i>

27:16.901 --> 27:18.936
<i>looking at her when she was
walking away was easier</i>

27:18.970 --> 27:22.439
because getting her to walk
straight at us has been hard.

27:24.943 --> 27:27.111
- I think we're good to go.
- All right.

27:28.079 --> 27:30.347
<i>[Sykes] Looks like
her angle is really good.</i>

27:30.415 --> 27:33.083
<i>Her leg is almost
exactly like the other leg.</i>

27:33.118 --> 27:34.752
And so we've decided
that it is time

27:34.786 --> 27:36.020
to take the screw out.

27:36.888 --> 27:39.023
- That's good.
- [woman] Started.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.692
<i>[Sykes] So, we're gonna
get her anesthetized,</i>

27:41.726 --> 27:43.127
<i>bring her back
to the health center,</i>

27:43.161 --> 27:45.963
<i>take out her screw,
and the bring her back.</i>

27:51.236 --> 27:52.503
Is that a rattlesnake?

27:52.537 --> 27:54.104
God, that's really pretty.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.142
We're gonna start demolition
on some of our older exhibits,

27:58.176 --> 28:01.145
to be replaced with new
and improved exhibits.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.880
<i>The animals have to be moved</i>

28:02.914 --> 28:04.915
<i>so that the exhibit can
be renovated.</i>

28:04.949 --> 28:06.617
<i>So, Andrew and I are going
to be removing</i>

28:06.818 --> 28:08.285
<i>the Ethiopian mountain vipers.</i>

28:09.154 --> 28:13.290
[Andrew] Just gonna shoot
right up and go home.

28:13.324 --> 28:16.527
We're also gonna be
removing some geckos,

28:16.561 --> 28:17.995
<i>and some dart frogs.</i>

28:18.029 --> 28:20.097
<i>Smaller animals
like dart frogs like</i>

28:20.131 --> 28:22.599
<i>to find little nooks
and crannies to hang out in.</i>

28:22.667 --> 28:25.035
<i>So, when we're doing
the demolition, we wanna</i>

28:25.070 --> 28:28.072
be cognizant of the fact that
there might still be frogs

28:28.106 --> 28:30.607
in the exhibit in places
we didn't expect.

28:30.675 --> 28:32.242
[Carlos] All right. You good?

28:37.182 --> 28:40.050
[Carlos] Huh? [chuckles]
Watch yourself, Annie.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.785
<i>I love to do the work.
You know?</i>

28:41.820 --> 28:43.020
<i>It's all in a days' work,
you know?</i>

28:43.054 --> 28:44.354
<i>You enjoy it, and you know,</i>

28:44.389 --> 28:46.457
you get exercise in the process.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.597
[man speaking]

28:53.832 --> 28:54.598
No, really?

28:54.799 --> 28:56.600
[man speaking]

28:56.701 --> 28:58.235
What? Where's the guy?

28:58.803 --> 29:00.571
- [man 2] Hold on, Benny.
- [man 3] Hold on.

29:00.605 --> 29:02.506
- [man 2] Yeah, frog.
- [woman 1] Just stop, guys.

29:04.809 --> 29:07.344
- [man 3] Catch him!
- [man 2] I'm not catching him.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.179
That might be poisonous.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.618
Hold on. Hold on.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.553
[man 2 speaking]

29:16.588 --> 29:17.855
[man 1 speaking]

29:17.889 --> 29:19.123
[man 2] Yeah, right there.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.060
[man 1] Whoa.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.361
[man on radio] Good job, Mike.

29:24.395 --> 29:26.263
- He's not poisonous?
- Nah. No.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.931
Oh, okay.

29:27.966 --> 29:29.933
[man 2 laughs]

29:33.304 --> 29:34.872
<i>[Avishai] We looked through
very carefully</i>

29:34.906 --> 29:36.240
<i>to make sure we had
all the frogs,</i>

29:36.274 --> 29:37.908
but dart frogs are small

29:37.942 --> 29:39.009
and they can be
a little bit sneaky.

29:39.043 --> 29:40.711
<i>So, we found one dart frog</i>

29:40.745 --> 29:43.580
<i>that was probably just hiding
somewhere in the rock-work.</i>

29:43.681 --> 29:45.816
<i>Poison dart frogs actually
aren't toxic</i>

29:45.850 --> 29:47.851
<i>when they're not from the wild.</i>

29:47.886 --> 29:50.788
<i>The way these frogs become
toxic is by eating</i>

29:50.822 --> 29:52.990
<i>different insects
and arthropods that have</i>

29:53.024 --> 29:54.725
that have
the toxins inside them.

29:54.759 --> 29:56.894
Then the frogs synthesize
those toxins

29:56.928 --> 29:59.096
and are able to excrete them
in their skin.

29:59.130 --> 30:03.534
So when they're not fed
those specific toxic insects,

30:03.568 --> 30:05.235
then they're not
toxic themselves.

30:10.074 --> 30:11.775
- [man] Good?
- Yeah. You go with it.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.210
[Carrie] Beautiful.

30:13.244 --> 30:16.747
<i>The Ethiopian mountain viper
exhibit is done.</i>

30:16.781 --> 30:18.348
<i>Everything's been demolished.</i>

30:18.382 --> 30:20.884
And now we can move
the new exhibit in.

30:20.919 --> 30:23.754
The rain won't hurt
the exhibit at all.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.190
This exhibit has
a number of water features

30:26.224 --> 30:28.525
and they have
one vulnerable point,

30:28.560 --> 30:30.994
<i>which is the drain.
It's not a flat base.</i>

30:31.029 --> 30:32.963
There's a little bit
of a drain sticking out.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.199
So you don't want
to hit that in any way.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.000
It's the only vulnerable spot.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.303
[man 1] Ready? Oh, okay. One.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.074
[man 2] Okay. Push it.
There you go.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.976
Just go slow.

30:49.247 --> 30:52.449
Oh. This is the part
that I don't like.

30:53.218 --> 30:55.219
[man 1] They gotta
get it over that pipe.

30:56.321 --> 30:58.922
[man 2] All right.
You gotta come in straight.

30:58.957 --> 31:01.325
[men in unison]
One, two, three.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.261
Whoa.

31:04.929 --> 31:07.364
- Right there.
- [man 3] Hold it there.

31:07.398 --> 31:09.166
[Carrie] The thing's
hundreds of pounds.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.868
It's quite a feat
to get these in.

31:10.902 --> 31:12.369
These guys are amazing.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.939
- So we're right on the drain.
- Yeah, we gotta lift it.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.175
- Yep. Straight.
- One. There you go.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.977
Watch your fingers.

31:20.011 --> 31:20.911
All right.

31:20.945 --> 31:23.347
All right. That's good.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.089
-[Carrie] Ooh. Let there be light.
-[woman chuckling]

31:32.123 --> 31:36.159
<i>[Carrie] Next steps are to
install the lights, do the plantings,</i>

31:36.193 --> 31:37.461
to wanna make sure it's right.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.764
<i>I can't wait to see
the animals in it.</i>

31:40.798 --> 31:43.367
<i>[Craig] In the wild, the mother's
constantly teaching the kittens</i>

31:43.401 --> 31:44.735
<i>what's right and what's wrong.</i>

31:44.769 --> 31:46.536
Okay.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.505
- [Raul] See, they're already getting into trouble.
- [Craig chuckling]

31:54.879 --> 31:56.046
[woman] Look, they're
standing on one leg.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.848
- [kid] It's still standing.
- [woman] Look at that guy.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.483
[screeching]

32:03.254 --> 32:06.023
[Michelle] All right, kids,
you ready to go?

32:06.057 --> 32:07.157
Yes?

32:07.191 --> 32:11.128
L2 finally got her screw
taken out of her leg.

32:12.096 --> 32:15.599
Here's the screw,
I think it's done its job.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.568
[Michelle] And everything
looks good for her.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.571
All right, kids, ready to go?

32:23.541 --> 32:25.108
[grunts]

32:26.311 --> 32:28.378
Come on, kids.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.059
They're slowly meandering
their way out.

32:42.093 --> 32:45.162
[Pat] Yeah, certainly not
charging out the way they used to.

32:46.764 --> 32:49.433
Now the trick is picking her
out from the crowd.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.103
[Pat] Well, the best case
scenario would be

32:53.137 --> 32:54.871
we can't tell which calf it is

32:54.906 --> 32:57.808
until we can see
her ear tag, you know?

32:57.842 --> 33:00.577
It'll show that things
are really in good shape.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.115
I think she's in
the middle there, some place.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.584
- I think that's her, right there.
- Yeah.

33:09.587 --> 33:12.122
There's no sign of any limp

33:12.156 --> 33:15.025
or any abnormality in her gait.

33:15.059 --> 33:18.528
When you see her run, she runs
just like the other calves.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.864
You know, I think they did
an excellent job

33:20.898 --> 33:24.968
getting that leg to correct
and there's every indication

33:25.002 --> 33:26.003
that, you know,
she's gonna grow up

33:26.037 --> 33:28.205
to be a very healthy
female bison.

33:29.273 --> 33:30.874
Once she's a young adult,

33:30.908 --> 33:33.710
we expect that
she'll begin producing calves,

33:33.745 --> 33:36.213
and that's something
that's really important for us

33:36.247 --> 33:38.148
as we try to really
increase the number

33:38.182 --> 33:40.951
of pure bison here at the zoo.

33:40.985 --> 33:42.719
But also then to be able
to provide animals

33:42.754 --> 33:44.921
to restoration programs.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.958
- [woman] She has no problems
eating. [laughing] - [Pat] No.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.207
[Avishai] It's
always really exciting

34:04.242 --> 34:07.010
when you first put an animal
into a new exhibit.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.546
We kind of get to see
how the animals

34:09.580 --> 34:12.015
- interact with all the new...
- [man] A whole new world.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.051
[Avishai] Yeah, an entirely
new environment, exactly.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.563
Go right in.

34:28.299 --> 34:29.566
[snake hissing]

34:31.202 --> 34:33.136
[Avishai] So we know we like it,

34:33.171 --> 34:35.372
but we have to see now
if the snake likes it.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.573
That's the key.

34:36.607 --> 34:38.208
[both chuckle]

34:38.242 --> 34:40.043
-Yeah
-[Avishai] Oh, okay.

34:40.078 --> 34:43.080
He found the stream.
Wow, that's pretty cool.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.981
Well, look at that.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.984
[Avishai chuckles]

34:48.019 --> 34:49.853
<i>This type of project
is really collaborative,</i>

34:49.887 --> 34:52.055
and it's really cool to see

34:52.090 --> 34:55.092
<i>how all this work from
all these different people</i>

34:55.126 --> 34:59.196
<i>all came together
to create this slice of nature</i>

34:59.230 --> 35:01.031
that people are gonna
get to enjoy and learn about.

35:01.065 --> 35:03.266
<i>Andrew and I grew up
around the zoo,</i>

35:03.300 --> 35:05.068
<i>and we used to come
when we were kids.</i>

35:05.103 --> 35:07.370
<i>If you told us when
we were five years old</i>

35:07.404 --> 35:09.239
<i>that we would be here
getting to see the snake</i>

35:09.273 --> 35:11.475
in the new exhibit
before anybody else,

35:11.509 --> 35:12.909
we would have freaked out.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.512
[Andrew] We spent our spare time
coming to the reptile department.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.548
Avi and I were both volunteers
from a young age,

35:18.583 --> 35:21.485
and spent a lot of our time
during the summer here.

35:21.519 --> 35:24.087
[Avishai] Yeah.
Now look at us.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.491
-[Andrew] Best friends.
-[Avishai chuckling] Living the dream!

35:28.259 --> 35:29.993
<i>[Avishai] It is pretty cool.</i>

35:31.295 --> 35:33.230
- [Jim] Hello.
- [woman] Hello.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.104
- [woman] See him up there?
- [kid] There's a snake!

35:41.139 --> 35:44.508
[woman] Oh! He's really
cool! He's big, right?

35:47.979 --> 35:50.514
- [Jim] It's really cool.
- [Pat] How's it goin'?

35:50.548 --> 35:52.415
- [Jim] Good, how are you?
- [Pat] Good.

35:52.449 --> 35:54.684
- [Jim] They're really pretty snakes.
- [Pat] Yeah, they really are.

35:54.719 --> 35:57.154
[Jim] That exhibit
turned out really nice.

35:58.756 --> 36:04.394
[Jim] I mean, it's really even hard
to tell the natural branch from the...

36:04.428 --> 36:07.764
-[Pat] From the-- Yeah, exactly
[chuckles] -[Jim] Fabricated one.

36:07.798 --> 36:10.033
<i>[Jim] What we do here is try</i>

36:10.067 --> 36:13.036
<i>to get people
to appreciate animals.</i>

36:13.070 --> 36:16.206
You do that not only by showing
people the actual animal itself,

36:16.240 --> 36:17.908
but you give 'em an idea

36:17.942 --> 36:19.910
<i>of where the animal fits
in the environment.</i>

36:19.944 --> 36:23.180
<i>So when you see a really
well-designed exhibit,</i>

36:23.214 --> 36:26.616
<i>it's demonstration of how much
the staff members</i>

36:26.651 --> 36:28.952
<i>know about the animals
that they're caring for.</i>

36:28.986 --> 36:30.487
<i>So they know about
the animal's biology,</i>

36:30.521 --> 36:32.022
<i>they know about
where the animal lives.</i>

36:32.056 --> 36:34.824
<i>And the fact that they can
take all that information,</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:38.128
<i>integrate it, incorporate it
in a design,</i>

36:38.162 --> 36:40.597
I mean, that's where
talent really comes in.

36:41.732 --> 36:43.600
[Jim] Pretty cool.

36:43.734 --> 36:44.834
[Craig] Daisy's a great mother.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.936
It's almost like
she read the book.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.837
- [Raul] Oh, boy.
- [Craig] Okay.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.539
[Craig] Look how
Daisy's going "No,

36:49.574 --> 36:51.208
- not on the first day."
- [Raul] "Get down."

36:54.745 --> 36:56.880
<i>[Jim] There's
something magical...</i>

36:56.914 --> 36:59.749
- [elephant trumpets] <i>- ...just
watching animals be animals.</i>

36:59.784 --> 37:01.918
- [eagle chirping]
<i>- Especially when</i>

37:01.953 --> 37:05.155
you're responsible
for all aspects of their life.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.923
[woman] Bye, Kip!

37:06.958 --> 37:08.191
Oh, here they come.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.528
This is the first time that
Babatunde's been anaesthetized.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.230
- [tranquilizer gun shoots]
- [gorilla screeching]

37:13.264 --> 37:16.933
- [man] Excited.
- [woman] Just be aware, he is a biter.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.235
- [camel grunts]
- [Jim] Good to know.

37:19.303 --> 37:21.037
Bad! Give me that back!

37:21.072 --> 37:22.105
[kid] Giraffe!

37:22.139 --> 37:23.573
[man] Welcome to New York, guys.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.108
[man chuckling] Whoo!

37:25.142 --> 37:26.910
[woman] Where are we at, buddy?

37:26.944 --> 37:28.011
[woman] I'm gonna
miss Clyde a lot.

37:28.045 --> 37:29.179
[barks]

37:29.213 --> 37:31.014
You can't help but get
attached to an animal.

37:31.048 --> 37:32.616
He's completely huggable.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.050
<i>[woman] Definitely
nice to start a day</i>

37:34.085 --> 37:35.885
<i>with an animal who's just
as happy to see you</i>

37:35.920 --> 37:37.754
<i>as you are to see them.</i>

37:37.788 --> 37:39.522
[man] Never know what you're
gonna expect when you come to work.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.558
- [man 1] Yeah, yep.
- [man 2] Yes.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.294
<i>[Jim] Sometimes you need
a few old farmers around here,</i>

37:44.328 --> 37:46.263
and a few less PhDs.

37:47.298 --> 37:49.165
[grunting softly]

37:59.176 --> 38:00.577
[man] Look how close it is!

38:07.084 --> 38:08.752
Lynx exhibit is secure.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.887
<i>[woman on radio] 10-4.</i>

38:10.921 --> 38:12.122
<i>[Raul] This
is our second attempt</i>

38:12.156 --> 38:15.525
<i>to introduce our three
lynx kittens to the exhibit.</i>

38:15.559 --> 38:17.727
<i>About a week ago,
the mom came out,</i>

38:17.762 --> 38:21.631
<i>took a quick look around,
ran back into the dens</i>

38:21.666 --> 38:26.870
and didn't feel comfortable calling
them out on exhibit or pushing them out.

38:26.904 --> 38:30.140
<i>- [woman on radio] All lynx going on exhibit.
- 10-4.</i>

38:30.174 --> 38:31.875
[door creaking open]

38:31.909 --> 38:33.410
- [Raul] There's the door.
- [Craig] Yeah.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.880
[Raul] Hi, Mom. It's Daisy.

38:36.914 --> 38:39.215
[Craig] Hey, Dais.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.785
- [Raul] She's checking things out.
- [Craig] Yeah.

38:41.819 --> 38:45.722
[Raul] She's making sure everything's
okay and safe for her kittens.

38:45.756 --> 38:48.558
<i>[Craig] The kittens rely on
their mother to take their cues.</i>

38:48.592 --> 38:49.993
In the wild, the mother's
constantly teaching

38:50.027 --> 38:52.128
the kittens what's right
and what's wrong

38:52.162 --> 38:54.030
<i>so they're doing everything
that they should be doing.</i>

38:54.065 --> 38:57.100
<i>Daisy's a great mother. It's
almost like she read the book.</i>

39:01.172 --> 39:04.774
- [Raul] Oh, someone's peekin' out, huh?
- [Craig] Yeah.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.309
There he is. There's one.

39:12.450 --> 39:15.051
- [Raul] Oh, look, how cute.
- [Craig] Wow.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.987
[Raul] There's another
one inside the cave,

39:18.022 --> 39:19.956
-inside the shelter.
-[Craig] Oh, he is. Right there, yep.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.291
[both chuckling]

39:22.860 --> 39:24.294
[Craig] Oh!

39:24.328 --> 39:26.196
[Raul] Is that the third one?
And there's one in the--

39:26.230 --> 39:28.465
- [Craig] All three are on exhibit.
- [Raul] Great! That's great.

39:30.935 --> 39:33.770
First time they've walked
on natural substrates.

39:33.804 --> 39:35.138
The leaves and trees

39:35.172 --> 39:36.973
and there's a lot
to take in there.

39:37.007 --> 39:38.608
There's a lot to learn for 'em.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.043
- [Raul chuckling]
- [man] How we doing, guys?

39:40.077 --> 39:41.277
- [Raul] Excellent.
- [Craig] Awesome.

39:41.311 --> 39:42.178
[man] Yeah?

39:42.213 --> 39:44.080
[Raul] They seem
to be enjoying themselves,

39:44.115 --> 39:46.015
they're playing
with one another.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.183
See, they're already
getting into trouble.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.486
[Craig and Raul chuckle]

39:49.520 --> 39:52.155
[Craig] This is one
of those times you're like,

39:52.189 --> 39:55.058
- "This is my job, I'm at work right now."
- Yeah.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.026
[Craig] Oh, he likes that.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.229
- He's like, "I'm going back up there."
- [man exclaims]

39:59.263 --> 40:01.064
[Craig] I remember
how excited we were

40:01.098 --> 40:02.165
when, you know, we knew

40:02.199 --> 40:04.801
that we had confirmed that
she had had kittens.

40:04.835 --> 40:07.170
So yeah, this is kind of,
like, the top of the mountain

40:07.204 --> 40:08.972
when they're out
on exhibit, you know?

40:09.006 --> 40:12.409
And you get to see them doing
what they should be doing.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.180
[Craig] Oh, okay.
They're getting bolder.

40:17.214 --> 40:20.049
Oh, she doesn't like that.
Look how Daisy's going "No,

40:20.084 --> 40:22.185
- not on the first day."
- [Raul] "Get down."

40:25.990 --> 40:27.690
She looks like she's ready
for them to come in.

40:27.725 --> 40:30.460
She's like, "All right,
you guys had enough. Come on."

40:30.494 --> 40:32.595
[Craig laughing] These
guys aren't ready.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.565
- Literally, it's like herding cats.
- [Raul laughing] She is.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.066
She really doesn't
know where to go

40:37.101 --> 40:38.635
or where to look at.

40:38.769 --> 40:40.136
My kids are twins,
I can definitely relate

40:40.171 --> 40:42.138
with how stressful it can be.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.640
It's like when I would
take my girls somewhere

40:43.674 --> 40:44.841
when they were toddlers.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.043
One would go to the right,
one would go to the left.

40:47.077 --> 40:49.245
But at least my girls
didn't climb.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.547
Yeah, come on, buddy.

40:50.581 --> 40:51.981
There we go, Daisy.

40:52.016 --> 40:55.018
[Craig] And back out.
[Raul] Ohhh. Close.

40:55.052 --> 40:56.853
It's sort of like when your
mom calls you to dinner

40:56.887 --> 40:59.255
and you just decide to play
outside for a little longer.

41:00.825 --> 41:03.226
<i>[Jim] For everybody working
here at the zoos and aquarium</i>

41:03.260 --> 41:05.061
<i>in New York,
it was a really tough year</i>

41:05.095 --> 41:07.297
<i>for the same reason
it was for everyone else.</i>

41:07.331 --> 41:10.834
For a long time, New York was
the epicenter of the pandemic,

41:10.868 --> 41:12.735
and in the beginning,
we were very anxious.

41:12.770 --> 41:15.605
<i>We didn't know
what the effect would be</i>

41:15.773 --> 41:17.807
<i>on our staff or
on our operation.</i>

41:17.842 --> 41:21.177
<i>But as we progressed through,</i>

41:21.212 --> 41:23.913
<i>and we manage to provide
constant care for the animals,</i>

41:23.948 --> 41:25.582
<i>we kind of got into a rhythm.</i>

41:27.184 --> 41:29.018
<i>Now that we're open,</i>

41:29.053 --> 41:31.354
<i>and people are happy
to come back,</i>

41:31.388 --> 41:33.957
<i>we do, kind of, see a light
at the end of the tunnel.</i>

41:33.991 --> 41:35.325
[all laughing]
