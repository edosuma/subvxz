[Wally] Um...

01:28.922 --> 01:29.798
great.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.425
Hey, you should check me out
on, uh, NPR this Saturday.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.261
<i>Bookworm</i> with Michael Silverblatt.
Great interview.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.304
You'll love it.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.223
-Nice.
-[Robby] Karina!

Come out here.

Wally, I want you to meet
my new girlfriend, Karina.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.312
She's from the neighborhood.

01:44.854 --> 01:45.772
Hey.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.524
So, Wally, any Valentine's plans?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.693
Not that I can think of.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.903
That used to be me.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.948
It's amazing what having a lady
in your life will do for you.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.575
It's one of the perks
of being published. You'll see.

Hey, Wally!

-Hey, Sasha.
-[Sasha] Hey.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.426
You okay? You look really upset.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.803
-I'm fine.
-[Sasha] Okay.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.639
Listen, I wanna invite you
to an "unlovable party" tonight.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.057
[Wally] "Unlovable party"?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.183
Is that one of those parties

02:22.267 --> 02:25.270
where everyone without dates
gets together and commiserates?

02:25.353 --> 02:26.187
It's fun.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.148
You know what, Sasha? I'll think about it.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.149
Great.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.110
I mean, how polite is it for you
to invite me to this thing

02:32.193 --> 02:34.779
considering you know
I'd really like to go out with you?

02:34.863 --> 02:36.406
You're overthinking this. I...

02:36.489 --> 02:37.615
Is that a surprise?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.701
Wally, come to the party.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.536
We'd love to have you.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.038
Okay? There will be some nice women
from my graduate program there.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.582
I'll e-mail you the details.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.043
-Don't be crushed if I don't come.

Hey, Wally. Check it out.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.387
[Kevin] It's a real page-turner.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.932
Actually, it's kinda good.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.475
I'm surprised.

No, he doesn't. He loves you.

He just doesn't know how to express it.

I brought some for Kevin, too.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.489
-They are amazing.
-[Jesse] All right!

04:41.990 --> 04:43.157
Get dressed, Wally.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.159
Three of us are going to The Elysian.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.661
-The Elysian?
-Yup.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.706
My mom gave me some money
to take someone special to dinner,

04:49.789 --> 04:51.457
and I thought I'd bring my two lovers.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.667
No way, Jesse.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.960
[Jesse] Yes way, Wally!

04:54.043 --> 04:55.628
Come on, we are not
gonna mope around tonight,

04:55.712 --> 04:57.755
and plus, you've always wanted
to go there, okay?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.090
The Elysian, on me.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.134
[Jesse exhales]
Can we go on another night

05:01.217 --> 05:02.802
when it's a little less humiliating?

05:03.011 --> 05:05.513
No. It's not as romantic on another night.

05:05.847 --> 05:06.931
Kevin's down.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.183
He said I can order anything on the menu.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.685
[Jesse] And you can too, Wally.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.478
Come on, I made a reservation.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.523
I'm sorry, Jesse,
I'm not gonna sit with you two

05:15.606 --> 05:17.525
at the most romantic restaurant
on the Eastside

05:17.608 --> 05:19.485
while couples stare
into each other's eyes.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.072
Thanks for the chocolates. Come on, Wally!

05:24.532 --> 05:27.118
The three of us can sit around here
all night and feel sorry for ourselves

05:27.201 --> 05:28.995
or we can get out there
and have a good time.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.246
It's Friday night!

05:30.747 --> 05:32.832
Don't let this Hallmark holiday
bring you down.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.418
[pen rasping]

05:36.961 --> 05:39.047
Okay, Kevin and I will go alone.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.214
Come on, Kevin.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.429
It's no wonder you're stuck. You're gonna die in here, Wally.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.321
[Jesse]
I can't believe we're going home alone,

06:45.738 --> 06:47.323
sleeping by ourselves.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.158
[groans]
Happy Valentine's.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.577
No.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.415
Guess there's always
Sasha's "unlovable party."

06:56.499 --> 06:58.292
No, no. No way.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.171
[Jesse groans]

07:02.255 --> 07:03.589
[Jesse] We got to get out of here.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.217
We need to go where normal people go.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.635

-You wanna move?
-What? No. Tonight.

07:10.888 --> 07:11.889
[stutters]

07:11.973 --> 07:14.934
There's this guy who comes
to the video store, Mark Stein.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.018
I know him.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.313
Yeah. Well, when Mark can't get laid
for a couple of months,

07:20.106 --> 07:23.860
he drives down to this great club
in Vegas, Friday nights,

07:23.943 --> 07:25.987
hooks up every time.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.782
-Mark does?
-Yeah, can you believe it?

07:32.160 --> 07:35.663
You know, Kevin, if we leave right now,

07:36.539 --> 07:37.790
we could be there by one.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.292
Are you crazy?

07:39.667 --> 07:42.503
It's Valentine's night.
I mean, no women are going to...

07:42.587 --> 07:44.046
No, no, no. Think about it.

07:44.714 --> 07:48.342
No single woman in that club
is gonna wanna go home alone, right?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.928
They're all gonna be looking for love.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.432
It could be the best night
of the year to go.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.142
Yeah.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.769
In a weird way, that makes sense.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.646
So, what do you say?

08:00.938 --> 08:02.565
I know I don't wanna go home.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.151
I'm game.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.405
And he's certainly in no position
to object.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.611
Uh, Las Vegas?

08:48.694 --> 08:50.363
[both] Surprise! But I don't wanna be in Las Vegas.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.575
[Wally] I wanna be in my bed.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.202
[Jesse] Oh, relax, Wally.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.329
You slept the whole way,
you didn't even have to drive,

08:58.412 --> 08:59.580
you should feel refreshed.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.291
I promise, this is gonna be
the best night of your life.

Good, good.

It's, uh...

It seems that way.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.450
Yeah.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.618
Thought it'd...

11:43.327 --> 11:44.412
you know...

11:44.829 --> 11:46.205
be really crowded.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.041
Me, too.

I guess the single chicks
were too embarrassed to go out tonight.

You should have seen
the last time I came here.

11:58.384 --> 12:02.680
So many hot-looking, willing girls.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.432
Yeah, yeah. You...

but then, when we got to Vegas, we...

to spend Valentine's together,

and then sleep with someone else
the next night.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.599
Maybe they'll like each other.
[chuckles]

28:47.726 --> 28:49.936
[light music]

28:52.522 --> 28:53.898
[tapping]

28:55.734 --> 28:56.693
Wally.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.486
[Robby] Wally!

28:58.570 --> 28:59.946
I'm late for work, Robby.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.657
Did you catch the piece about me
in <i>The Paris Review</i> ?

29:03.241 --> 29:04.159
No.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.592
[clattering]

29:22.218 --> 29:23.219
Anything else?

29:24.137 --> 29:25.221
You know, Wally,

29:25.805 --> 29:28.433
if it makes you uncomfortable,
you don't have to read it.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.774
[calm music]

29:38.860 --> 29:41.196
[James Peavy]
<i>A Street Urchin Finds a Voice.</i>

29:41.279 --> 29:45.909
<i>In his excruciatingly beautiful memoir,</i>
MacArthur Parked,

29:45.992 --> 29:50.830
<i>Robert "Robby" LeBeau has burst
onto the American literary landscape...</i>

29:50.914 --> 29:54.250
[car engine revving]

30:00.757 --> 30:03.927
[woman speaking Spanish]

30:04.010 --> 30:06.721
[man speaking Spanish]

30:06.805 --> 30:11.142
[men chattering in Spanish]

30:11.726 --> 30:14.354
[upbeat music]

30:20.819 --> 30:23.029
[upbeat music continues]

30:27.826 --> 30:31.037
[classical music]

30:39.796 --> 30:42.799
[classical music continues]

31:01.317 --> 31:04.696
Hi, sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for this guy called Wally.

31:04.779 --> 31:07.615
[Chuck] Uh, little dude, like, 5'7",

31:07.699 --> 31:09.701
140 pounds on a good day.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.286
Uh, he's a writer.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.495
You know him?

31:13.830 --> 31:15.206
Are you a cop?

31:15.832 --> 31:17.876
Am I a cop? No, I play golf.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.212
Um, in fact, I was on the tour
for a couple of years,

31:21.296 --> 31:22.797
and, uh, now, I'm a golf pro

31:22.881 --> 31:25.258
at the Cinque Terre Country Club
in the Palisades.

31:25.341 --> 31:26.843
-[Chuck] You know it?
-Uh...

31:26.926 --> 31:31.681
I'm just curious why you don't seem
to know this guy's last name.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.600
He never told it to me.
[soft chuckle]

31:34.684 --> 31:35.685
Hm.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.479
Uh, I don't wanna cause any trouble.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.398
I just thought, you know,

31:40.815 --> 31:44.611
he's a writer and this is a bookstore,
there'd be a connection.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.907
[romantic music]

31:54.287 --> 31:57.123
[romantic music continues]

31:59.584 --> 32:00.710
[knocking on door]

32:01.419 --> 32:03.338
[heavy breathing]

32:07.050 --> 32:08.843
[knocking on door]

32:13.640 --> 32:16.100
Hi! Is, uh... Is Wally here?

32:17.894 --> 32:18.853
No.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.981
You're one of his friends
from Vegas, right?

32:25.193 --> 32:26.402
Good to see you again.

32:27.028 --> 32:27.987
Thank you.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.698
So, Jeanine and I, we, uh...

32:30.782 --> 32:33.868
We felt terrible
about everything that happened, and...

32:33.952 --> 32:36.746
Well, we were hoping that we could
set Wally up with our friend, Tammy.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.498
She's this really great girl.

32:38.581 --> 32:39.874
You wanna set up Wally?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.084
Yeah, with our friend, Tammy.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.086
I think he'd really dig her.
She's a Laker Girl.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.505
A Laker Girl?

32:45.713 --> 32:47.173
Yeah, she's very good.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.383
You're kidding me, right?

32:48.716 --> 32:50.134
Who knows Laker Girls?

32:50.677 --> 32:52.053
Jeanine and I know several.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.389
Wally loves the Lakers. He's a fan.

32:54.597 --> 32:56.182
He'd definitely be into it.

32:56.265 --> 32:57.266
[Chuck] Perfect!

32:57.517 --> 33:00.395
So, we were thinking Friday,
for lunch maybe,

33:00.478 --> 33:03.147
at the Cinque Terre Country Club
in the Palisades, say, around noon?

33:03.481 --> 33:04.440
Okay.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.234
So...

33:06.609 --> 33:07.735
it's a plan?

33:07.819 --> 33:09.946
Yes. Absolutely.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.406
No way.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.699
[Jesse] You're a coward.

33:13.282 --> 33:16.077
Wally, great writers
lead interesting lives.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.328
Do you agree?

33:17.412 --> 33:18.663
With some exceptions.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.581
Emily Dickinson never left her room.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.791
Is that true, Kevin?

33:21.874 --> 33:24.293
As far as we know, Jesse.
I'm gonna look it up later.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.587
But for the most part,

33:27.547 --> 33:29.215
do you lead an interesting life?

33:30.174 --> 33:32.802
You gotta start living life, Wally.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.721
I don't wanna be harsh, but...

33:34.804 --> 33:36.764
you got nothing to write about. [Kevin] That's why you've been working
on the same novel

33:39.267 --> 33:40.560
for three-and-a-half years.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.687
But I don't wanna write about Laker Girls.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.230
You're missing the point.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.982
You're gaining street cred.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.609
You go to Vegas,
you hook up in a hotel room,

33:48.693 --> 33:51.571
and then you date her friend
who happens to be a Laker Girl.

33:51.654 --> 33:52.822
You go to Bangladesh,

33:52.905 --> 33:53.948
you get a Euro pass,

33:54.032 --> 33:55.491
you take the train all over Europe.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.744
I don't know. You enrich yourself.

33:58.911 --> 34:00.204
You get a buzz about you.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.249
[Kevin] People start wanting to hear
what you have to say.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.793
Robby LeBeau would go.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.128
[Kevin] Exactly!

34:07.420 --> 34:09.005
When Robby came to town,

34:09.297 --> 34:10.840
he got into plenty of trouble.

34:10.922 --> 34:12.884
You know that's bullshit, Kevin.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.260
It's irrelevant.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.594
I don't understand.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.973
Back in the day,
Robby had this drug jones.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.601
He had to pull tricks in MacArthur Park
in order to keep the pills coming.

34:22.685 --> 34:23.770
Robby's a liar.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.353
Tell that to Alan.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.606
Who's Alan?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.275
The 70-year-old man
who fell in love with him.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.568
[Jesse] Wow.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.529
And you can't even go out
with a Laker Girl?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.239
What a pansy.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.455
[gloomy music]

34:43.956 --> 34:45.625
Fuck me.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.835
[car horns honking]

34:54.550 --> 34:57.386
[calm music]

35:07.146 --> 35:09.565
[tires screeching]

35:11.984 --> 35:13.611
Welcome to Cinque Terre, sir.

35:15.029 --> 35:15.905
Oh.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.836
[woman #4] From the very beginning,
we decided this museum

35:29.919 --> 35:31.838
is going to be a huge project.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.589
Can I help you, sir? [Wally] Yes, um...

35:35.633 --> 35:40.471
I'm here for lunch with Chuck,
Jeanine, and Tammy.

35:41.681 --> 35:44.267
Oh, yes. They asked
if you would meet them by the first tee.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.728
Is something wrong, sir?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.063
[sighs]

35:54.026 --> 35:55.444
Wally!
[Jeanine gasps]

35:55.528 --> 35:56.445
Hi!

35:57.321 --> 35:58.614
-Come down!
-Yeah, yeah.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.449
-Come on.
-Stairs over there. Come here.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.250
[Chuck] Wally.
[Jeanine giggles]

36:09.333 --> 36:10.877
-[Jeanine] Hi, Wally.
-[Wally] Hello.

36:11.127 --> 36:15.006
Wally, I'd like you to meet Tammy.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.008
Hi, Tammy.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.137
Hi, Wally.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.723
Guys, I thought we were having lunch.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.225
We are, but we thought it might be fun
to play around and golf first,

36:26.309 --> 36:27.894
work up an appetite. You in?

36:27.977 --> 36:28.895
[stutters]
But, uh...

36:28.978 --> 36:31.105
I know you didn't bring
any of your equipment, but it's okay.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.232
We'll go over to the pro shop,
get you everything you need.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.943
-We have Titleist, Callaway...
-Chuck. I don't play golf.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.239
Oh. Oh, Wally, I'm so sorry.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.159
[Chuck] That's just so rude of us
to just assume, isn't it? We...

36:43.242 --> 36:45.036
Well, we'll go get lunch, okay?
We'll just eat.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.371
[Jeanine] Absolutely!
Not a problem at all.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.332
-It was stupid of us. Yeah.
-Yeah.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.791
And that's okay. Right, Tammy?

36:52.710 --> 36:53.711
Of course.

36:53.794 --> 36:55.671
Come on, come on. Let's grab our stuff.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.761
[sighs]

37:03.137 --> 37:04.096
Guys?

37:06.474 --> 37:09.352
If it's okay, I'd like to give it a try.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.354
[lively music]

37:11.437 --> 37:13.189
Attaboy, Wally!
[giggles]

37:13.272 --> 37:14.982
Attaboy! That's the spirit.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.151
[Chuck] Go play golf.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.407
[Chuck] Now, Wally, remember,

37:23.491 --> 37:25.117
in the game of golf,
we have two objectives.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.119
We wanna hit the ball a certain distance,

37:27.203 --> 37:29.205
and we wanna hit the ball
a certain direction.

37:29.288 --> 37:32.083
Now, I want you to have
a clear picture in your mind

37:32.166 --> 37:34.168
of exactly where you want the ball
to end up.

37:34.794 --> 37:35.628
In the hole?

37:35.711 --> 37:37.088
[laughs]

37:37.171 --> 37:38.214
Yeah, a hole in one.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.007
That's it, Wally. You aim for the stars.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.467
-[Chuck] Now...
-He is ambitious, Chuck.

37:41.550 --> 37:42.468
[Chuck] Yeah, he sure is.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.470
Now, when I take my hands away,

37:44.553 --> 37:46.764
I want you to bring the driver back
like we discussed,

37:46.847 --> 37:48.933
and then follow through the ball, okay?

37:49.517 --> 37:50.476
You got this.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.312
-He's gonna great.
-Yeah.

37:59.819 --> 38:00.778
[thwacks]

38:02.780 --> 38:03.656
[thuds]

38:03.739 --> 38:04.573
[chirping]

38:04.657 --> 38:06.617
[leaves rustling]

38:09.787 --> 38:10.621
[light thud]

38:10.705 --> 38:11.580
[Chuck] Oh.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.249
[owl squeals]

38:13.874 --> 38:14.792
God.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.469
[Jeanine] Oh, my god.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.846
It's an owl.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.307
[Wally] An owl?
[owl whines]

38:29.557 --> 38:30.766
I hit an owl?

38:30.850 --> 38:32.268
Don't worry, Wally. It's okay. [Chuck] Probably just got his bell rang.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.479
-Look at his eyes.
-[Jeanine] Oh...

38:35.563 --> 38:37.023
[Wally] What have I done?

38:37.106 --> 38:39.233
Wally, trust me. He's fine.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.568
[owl hooting]

38:40.901 --> 38:42.028
Hey, pal.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.572
[Chuck] Are you okay, little fella?

38:44.655 --> 38:45.698
[hooting]

38:46.073 --> 38:46.991
Hey.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.409
Sorry about that, mate.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.535
[owl calls]

38:52.288 --> 38:53.539
Attaboy.

38:54.081 --> 38:55.166
[Jeanine giggles]

38:56.042 --> 38:57.668
[chuckling]

38:57.752 --> 38:58.753
It's all right.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.630
[Chuck] You see, that's what I love
about this game, Wally.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.257
You never know
what's gonna happen next, eh?

39:03.341 --> 39:05.301
It's probably not even the first time
he's been hit.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.345
[Wally]
Well, it's a good sign he flew away.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.804
[Chuck] See? There you go.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.849
You also got to take into account
that he's probably not used to daytime.

39:12.683 --> 39:15.227
Your ball is probably over there,
somewhere. Don't worry, we'll find it.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.356
[Chuck] Jeanine tells me you're a writer.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.776
It's impressive, Wally.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.944
I've never been friends
with an author before.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.822
Oh, there was this Asian kid
when I was in university

39:26.906 --> 39:28.074
that I wanted to be friends with.

39:28.157 --> 39:31.660
But, you know, I was in the golf team
and he was short and intellectual.

39:31.744 --> 39:35.289
So... He just seemed
intimidated by me, so I left him alone.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.415
You know what I mean?

39:37.083 --> 39:38.542
I'm gonna help you out here.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.382
[Chuck] Watch out for snakes, Wally.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.885
[uplifting music]

39:48.719 --> 39:50.805
[leaves rustling]

39:55.351 --> 39:57.978
[Wally panting]

39:59.688 --> 40:01.190
This will impress Tammy.

40:06.904 --> 40:07.863
[thumps]

40:13.702 --> 40:14.829
[Tammy] Wow!

40:16.539 --> 40:17.456
[Chuck] Hm?

40:17.540 --> 40:19.542
[Jeanine] Great shot, Wally!

40:21.210 --> 40:24.213
[uplifting music]

40:30.845 --> 40:32.138
So?

40:32.680 --> 40:34.140
What do you think of him?

40:35.266 --> 40:36.392
He's...

40:37.393 --> 40:38.602
interesting.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.396
Not what you're used to.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.565
No.
[both giggling]

40:42.648 --> 40:45.109
-No.
-But you're liking him, right?

40:45.693 --> 40:47.862
-Yeah, I think so.
-Good! Yes.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.238
-Yes, that's good. Okay.
-I think so.

40:49.321 --> 40:51.115

It's okay, Wally.
You're getting the hang of it.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.964
[Chuck] Relax those wrists, pal.

41:07.047 --> 41:08.132
Grip's too tight.

41:08.507 --> 41:09.884
You've got this. Come on.

[heavy breathing]

[Wally groans]

41:16.599 --> 41:19.101
Wally, listen to me.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.395
[Jeanine] You've got to stop thinking.

41:22.354 --> 41:26.817
Just open the top of your head,
and let all thoughts float out.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.903

42:10.861 --> 42:11.779
[Chuck] Huh?

42:11.862 --> 42:13.864

42:15.157 --> 42:16.325
[Jeanine] Whoo-hoo!

42:16.408 --> 42:19.411
[retro music]

42:22.998 --> 42:26.669
So, how many more would Tiger need
to catch up with Nicklaus?

42:27.253 --> 42:30.714
Well, um, four to tie,
but five to pass him.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.132
It's such a shame, isn't it?

42:32.216 --> 42:34.051
'Cause I just don't think
he's got it in him anymore.

42:34.134 --> 42:35.427
Oh, I think he does.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.096
He just needs to clear his mind.

42:37.179 --> 42:38.889
When you do that, anything is possible.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.558
[snickers]
[Chuck] Okay.

42:40.641 --> 42:41.642
Oh.

42:42.351 --> 42:43.769
-Fellas, come over here.
-Nice.

42:43.852 --> 42:45.312
-Hey.
-There's someone I want you to meet.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.730
-Jeanine, Tammy.
-[Jeanine &amp; Tammy] Hi.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.190
I wanna introduce you to somebody.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.984
This is Wally Spivak.
He's a good friend of ours.

42:50.067 --> 42:53.445
[Chuck] Wally, this is Bill Hundleson.
He's an esteemed member of our club.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.447
And this is Kyle Newcombe,
a fellow pro here.

42:55.531 --> 42:58.784
And he and I shared a cup of coffee
on the tour a few years back.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.244
Bill Hundleson.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.204
Kyle Newcombe.

43:02.538 --> 43:04.415
Wally Spivak. Nice to meet you, fellas.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.250
Nice to meet you, Wally. Welcome.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.836
-So you know Chuck, huh?
-Mm-hm.

43:08.919 --> 43:10.045
Chuck's a good guy...

43:10.838 --> 43:12.881
sometimes.
[all laugh]

43:13.340 --> 43:14.466
Watch out for him, Wally.

43:14.550 --> 43:15.718
[Chuck] Oh...
[laughter]

43:15.801 --> 43:17.344
-Huh.
-Oh.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.054
[all laughing]

43:19.138 --> 43:20.306
Okay. Wally here, he's a writer.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.516
He just played
his first round of golf ever.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.312
I'd imagine, uh, it's a pretty tough game
for a writer.

43:26.395 --> 43:29.481
No. He hit a 250-yard tee shot
off the ninth.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.985
I also hit an owl.

43:37.823 --> 43:39.617
Next time, try for a birdie.

43:39.700 --> 43:43.037
[loud laughter]

43:46.332 --> 43:48.417
[laughing]

43:48.500 --> 43:50.961
-That's golf humor, right?
-Yeah.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.004
Yes.

43:53.672 --> 43:54.673
[clinks]

43:55.591 --> 43:56.467
Jeez.

43:57.593 --> 43:58.719
What's in these things?

43:58.802 --> 44:02.806
The Double Eagle has quite a lot
of vodka in it, Wally.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.392
I don't think I can drive.

44:06.143 --> 44:07.561
I'll drive you home.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.293
I'm so jealous.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.711
There's nothing to be jealous about.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.088
[Wally] I'm not dating her.

44:34.171 --> 44:35.964
[Kevin] Give it some time, Wally.

44:36.048 --> 44:37.633
[Jesse]
Yeah, maybe you'll grow to like her.

44:39.259 --> 44:41.178
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.931
-[Kevin] Hey, Chuck!
-[Chuck] Hey, pal.

44:44.014 --> 44:45.265
-Hi, Jeanine.
-Hi.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.433
This is Jesse, you guys.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.643
-Great to finally meet you.
-Hey.

44:47.726 --> 44:49.520
-[Jeanine] Yeah, nice to meet you.
-It's a pleasure.

44:49.603 --> 44:52.856
So, I hear congratulations are in order.
I heard you and Tammy are an item.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.691
I'm so happy for you, Wally.

44:54.775 --> 44:56.402
-She is a great girl.
-Great girl.

44:56.485 --> 44:58.821
Yeah. We love her.

-In his face!
-That's what I'm talking about!

45:20.884 --> 45:21.802
Whoo!

45:22.177 --> 45:24.179
[crowd cheering]

45:29.726 --> 45:31.645
Wally, did you ever read
<i>The Turn of the Screw</i> ?

45:33.397 --> 45:35.983
Great book, wasn't it?
I mean, packed one hell of a punch.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.740
You know, back when I was
in secondary school, they forced me to read all the classics.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.077
You know, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>,

45:48.203 --> 45:49.663
Kafka's <i>The Castle</i>,

45:50.164 --> 45:51.623
<i>The Sound and the Fury</i>,

45:52.082 --> 45:53.959
<i>A Hundred Years of Solitude</i>,
remember that?

45:54.543 --> 45:58.005
Well, Gabriel García Márquez.

45:59.423 --> 46:00.382
Wally.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.510
I lost myself in those books.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.932
For some reason,
I never read another novel again.

46:09.016 --> 46:13.353
I just couldn't seem to do it on my own,
unless it was assigned.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.023
It's been so frustrating.

46:19.318 --> 46:22.779
So, yeah, I was wondering
where I might find one of your novels.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.493
Jeanine and I were at Barnes and Noble
the other day,

46:27.576 --> 46:29.995
and we were looking for you,
under "S," but...

46:30.287 --> 46:31.246
nothing.

46:32.623 --> 46:33.624
Chuck.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.169
Chuck, I've never been published.

46:39.421 --> 46:41.673
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't...

46:42.174 --> 46:43.175
I...

46:43.509 --> 46:46.512
[somber music]

46:49.473 --> 46:51.016
I'd still like to read one, though.

46:53.727 --> 46:55.312
What are you guys talking about?

46:55.395 --> 46:58.106
Oh, I was just asking Wally
if I could read one of his novels.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.484
Oh, Wally. That would be awesome.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.152
Yeah, Chuck and I
were in Barnes and Noble...

47:02.236 --> 47:03.654
Uh, yeah. Um...

47:03.737 --> 47:06.532
-Guys, who wants another beer?
-Yes, definitely.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.200
-Yeah? All right.
-Another one? Thanks, Chuck.

47:08.283 --> 47:09.284
[Jesse] Thanks, Chuck.

47:12.037 --> 47:13.288
[Chuck] That was fun. Tell me if he'll go.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.292
[Jeanine giggles]

47:17.626 --> 47:19.503
[Chuck] Hey, Wally. Our car's here.

47:20.587 --> 47:22.214
Buddy, buddy...

47:23.090 --> 47:26.176
I will check my e-mail in the morning.
I can't wait to read the book.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.594
I can't wait. It's gonna be great.

47:27.678 --> 47:28.720
-See you, guys.
-[Kevin] Okay.

47:28.804 --> 47:31.098
-It's really nice to see you again, Wally.
-[Jesse] Thanks, Chuck.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.142
[Jeanine] Tammy.

47:35.394 --> 47:38.230
What do you think about the four of us
getting away one of these weekends?

47:38.605 --> 47:40.607
[gasps]
We could go wine tasting in Napa,

47:40.691 --> 47:43.110
or we could go
to The Del Coronado in San Diego.

47:43.193 --> 47:44.945
-We'd love to!
-[Jeanine] Fantastic!

47:45.028 --> 47:46.530
Okay. Bye, you guys.

47:46.613 --> 47:48.031
-[Jesse] Bye.
-[Jeanine] Bye!

47:48.115 --> 47:50.659
Uh, Tammy, I will call you
to cement the deets.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.035
-Sounds great.
-[Jeanine] Okay.

47:52.578 --> 47:53.745
[happy gasp]

47:54.705 --> 47:58.875
So, guys, what are your plans tonight?

48:00.210 --> 48:01.795
We're actually really tired.

48:03.463 --> 48:05.173
-Starkesha, Chani!
-[Chani] Hey.

48:05.340 --> 48:07.384
Hey, Tammy. What do you guys got up?

48:07.759 --> 48:10.512
Well, I was hoping to hang
with these guys, but they are tired.

48:10.596 --> 48:12.514
-Uh, we're good.
-We can hang.

48:12.598 --> 48:14.099
[Chani] What do you guys have in mind?

48:14.850 --> 48:16.018
Um...

48:18.353 --> 48:20.147
How about chilling at our place?

48:20.856 --> 48:21.982
-Sure.
-Sure.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.401
Yes, yes.

48:24.484 --> 48:27.613
-Could Adriana come?
-Of course! The more the merrier.

48:28.614 --> 48:30.073
This is so uncool.

48:31.033 --> 48:32.242
So uncool.

48:32.326 --> 48:34.202
[Kevin] For god's sakes, Wally.

48:34.286 --> 48:38.915
A pretty, sweet,
I'd venture to say, hot girl likes you.

48:39.541 --> 48:42.377
We're not gonna let you walk away
without giving it a shot.

48:42.461 --> 48:44.046
And think about it,

48:44.129 --> 48:47.215
your love life has been
one disaster after another.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.134
A series of short-term relationships

48:49.217 --> 48:50.552
-[Jesse] Yeah.
-with intellectual women

48:50.636 --> 48:52.888
-that always end in arguments, mistrust,
-[Jesse] Preach, Kevin.

48:52.971 --> 48:55.474
charges of hypocrisy, disappointment,

48:55.557 --> 48:58.560
-and Lord knows what else.
-[Jesse] Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

48:58.644 --> 48:59.978
We're doing you a favor.

49:00.354 --> 49:02.898
[Kevin] You're gonna have
so much material for your book.

49:02.981 --> 49:06.902
[Jesse] Yeah, it will write itself.
Your book, Wally. Think of your book.

49:06.985 --> 49:09.029
Let me out. Let me out right now.

49:09.112 --> 49:10.989
You're being selfish, Wally.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.950
Jesse and I finally have a chance
to get laid, too.

49:14.034 --> 49:16.495
[Jesse] And this can't always be
about you, Wally.

49:17.454 --> 49:22.209
Let me out!

49:41.770 --> 49:43.605
There was an emergency at the library?

He's such a pain in the ass.

Oh, shit. It's Mark Stein.

-Hey, Mark.
-[Mark] <i>Hey, Jesse.</i>

49:55.992 --> 49:57.077

-Hang up.

[retro romantic music continues]

50:57.387 --> 50:58.388
Tammy?

51:00.265 --> 51:02.100
Maybe we should go to the library now.

51:02.642 --> 51:04.186
Relax, Tammy.

You were so drunk last night,

55:01.339 --> 55:03.883
Well, you took a little detour
on the way home.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.970
Apparently, there was some kind
of flooding at the library.

55:07.053 --> 55:09.347
When you got home,
you were completely wasted.

You really took charge.

55:37.333 --> 55:39.169

There's this guy called Robby LeBeau.

is true.

I was just gonna lie
and let Chuck have what he wanted.

01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:16.759
I know it's early. I just...

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:20.011
Just... I couldn't wait to tell you.
I stayed up all night reading your book,

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.430
<i>and I just finished it.</i>

01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:23.640
You finished?

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.769
I really need to talk to you about this.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.033
This place is amazing.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.952
Listen, um...

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:26.953
I haven't read much,

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.415
so I don't know if this would mean
anything to you, but, uh...

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.375
I loved your book.

01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:35.546
What are you saying, Chuck?

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:41.301
I'm saying, Wally, that I loved your book.

01:09:43.804 --> 01:09:45.055
And while I was driving over here,

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:47.349
I had all these questions
I wanted to ask you, all these things,

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.019
but then, I realized that maybe,

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.313
maybe the questions aren't even meant
to be answered, you know?

01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:54.732
Maybe, maybe they're just meant to linger.

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.235
I'm just... Correct me
if I'm wrong, Wally.

01:09:58.319 --> 01:09:59.528
I'm just trying to understand.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:07.786
You're serious, aren't you?

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:11.540
I have never been more serious in my life.

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.296
Chuck, this is crazy.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.382
You're not wrong.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:22.843
You got it exactly right.

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:26.180
[Wally] Everyone wants answers
when there are none.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:29.892
You don't know how long I worked on it,

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:33.354
how many people
who I thought would understand...

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:35.272
didn't.

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:38.359
[Wally] Chuck.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:42.738
You're the only person who has ever gotten
through to the end of the book.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:45.658
Wally, it's so weird, right?
'Cause when I was reading it,

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.993
[Chuck] I just kept thinking
about that dude who cut his ear off.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.371
You know, he did all those paintings,
and then no one bought them,

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:51.497
and he killed himself.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:55.042
-Van Gogh?
-Van Gogh! Oh, Wally.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.921
You remind me of Van Gogh.

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.674
You have to stick this out, man.

01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:04.426
You are going to be published.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.012
Thank you, Chuck.

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:10.766
Hey, Wally.

01:11:11.183 --> 01:11:12.434
Sasha, we are a little busy.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.811
No, it's okay.

01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:16.146
Uh, join us. I'm Chuck.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.982
Hi, Chuck. I'm Sasha.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.443
So, uh, how do you two...

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.862
Oh, Wally dates my fiancée's best friend.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.533
You... You do, Wally?

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:28.993
Oh.

01:11:29.493 --> 01:11:30.744
Wally never told me that.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.498
Are you a writer?

01:11:34.581 --> 01:11:35.749
[Sasha] Well, of sorts.
[chuckles]

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.543
I'm studying cultural anthropology.

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:40.004
I'm waiting on my grant to come through
to study in China.

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:41.630
She's been waiting a long time.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:44.842
Well, not nearly as long
as Wally's been working on his book,

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:47.386
which I see you've downloaded, huh?

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:48.595

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:50.514

[Mark] Hey, guys.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:55.269
-You, uh, here for the reading?
-Yeah, I sure am.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:56.478
What reading?

01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:58.397

This afternoon, I would like to introduce
a real forward thinker,

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:13.996
someone who has put the ethos
of Eastside Los Angeles on the map.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:18.792
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
a warm welcome for Mr. Robby LeBeau.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.086
We love you, Robby.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.796
Now, this guy is the real deal.

He loved the reading.

-I appreciate it, man.
-[Chuck] Mr. LeBeau, hi.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.275
I've never been to a reading before,
but I think I can safely say

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:26.985
that I will never be the same again.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.112
Right.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.154
I don't think
I can go through with it, Wally.

What?

I don't know what to do. I'm...

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.751
panicking, Wally, I'm panicking.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.378
It's just wedding jitters.

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.256
It's more than that.

I don't...

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:50.058
I don't want my children growing up
the way Jeanine and I did.

01:18:52.185 --> 01:18:54.813
I don't want my son walking around
with nothing in his head.

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:58.650
I don't want my daughter
playing beach volleyball.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.193
You should understand that.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:01.653
Huh?

01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:06.491
I want worldly children, Wally.

01:19:07.033 --> 01:19:08.368
[Chuck] And, uh...

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.872
I can't give that to them.

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:15.167
And bless her, but Jeanine can't either.

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.462
Chuck, you've lost your mind.

01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:22.048
I want to have
intellectual conversations, Wally.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:25.051
I wanna have intellectual conversations
at the dinner table.

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:26.928
I wanna have them in the car. I want...

01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:29.389
I want them in bed.

01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:34.603
-Chuck, you're a golf pro.
-Don't patronize me.

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:38.315
[Chuck sighs]

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:43.320
I'm in love with Sasha Perez.

01:19:43.403 --> 01:19:44.404
[Wally gasps] It's true.

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.373
Charles, please.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.210
Go away.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.378
No. I've come all this way
to be here for you!

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.671
Go away, Hugh!

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.673
And what do you expect me
to tell Mother and Father?

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:05.592
I don't care! Just go away!

01:20:10.847 --> 01:20:12.516
I'm a horrible person, Wally.

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.143
[Chuck] I broke the agreement.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:18.980
I slept with somebody else
after Valentine's.

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:23.985
You're talking about Sasha, my friend,

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.656
from the coffee house
who I introduced you to?

01:20:27.739 --> 01:20:29.491
She takes my breath away.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:30.992
Wally, she's...

01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:33.495
the most intelligent woman I've ever met.

01:20:33.578 --> 01:20:35.080
I mean, by far.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:37.040
She's stupid, Chuck.

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.544
Don't get ugly now, Wally.
I know you've got a soft spot for her.

01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:42.379
-Uh, no, I haven't.
-[Chuck] Yes, you do.

01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:45.507
You've been trying to date her for years.
She told me. It's fine.

01:20:47.759 --> 01:20:49.261
How long has this been going on?

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.680
[sighs]

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.306
Every day...

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:55.725
since you introduced us
at the coffee house.

01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.395
Every day?

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:00.397
Oh, Chuck.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.024
I was hoping you could convince me
to stay, but...

01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:06.236
Wally,

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:09.447
I can't be mad at you.

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:14.327
[exhales]
Without you, I'd never have found myself.

01:21:16.788 --> 01:21:18.331
[sobs]

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:21.418
[piano playing]

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.463
[hurried footsteps]

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:29.843
What happened, Wally?

01:21:29.926 --> 01:21:32.304
Chuck's leaving.
He doesn't wanna marry Jeanine!

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:33.471
Why?

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.265
He's in love with Sasha Perez!

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.815
But she's unlovable.

01:21:46.192 --> 01:21:47.152
[car alarm beeps]

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:50.322
[Wally] Chuck! Please, don't do this!

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.710
You're making a big mistake.

01:22:03.793 --> 01:22:06.338
-Jeanine is such a beautiful girl.
-[Chuck] I know, Wally.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:10.091
It's gonna be so hard for her
to hear the news.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.555
But you're a writer,
so you will think of something.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:17.599
[engine revving]

01:22:27.692 --> 01:22:29.694
[somber music]

01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:35.784
Wally.

01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:39.162
[Kevin] He left.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:41.831
It's not your fault, Wally.

01:22:42.248 --> 01:22:44.042
His fiancée slept with you in Vegas.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.170
All you've done
is try and push the Westside away.

01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:48.755
[footsteps clacking]

01:22:48.838 --> 01:22:50.298
But it just kept coming.

01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:55.095
[people murmuring]

01:22:55.178 --> 01:22:56.388
But I think we should leave.

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.181
Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be
any fun now.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.058
He left, didn't he?

01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:01.935
You look great, Tammy.

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:03.853
Who the fuck is Sasha Perez?

01:23:05.271 --> 01:23:06.815
She's a friend of mine.

01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:07.941
Figures.

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:10.485
I rue the day Jeanine ever got
involved with you.

01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:11.820
It has been a nightmare!

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:14.155
Hey! It's not Wally's fault.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:17.409
If it weren't for Wally,
there would be a wedding going on inside.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:18.702
[Jeanine] Excuse me, excuse me.

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:20.495
[whispering]
[woman #5] Oh, my god. She's coming.

01:23:20.578 --> 01:23:22.038
Sasha Perez is Wally's friend.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.666
Some kind of a wicked witch
from the Eastside, no doubt.

01:23:24.749 --> 01:23:27.085
She probably made a voodoo doll of you
and stuck pins in it.

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:28.253
[crowd gasps]

01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:30.839
I'm so sorry, Jeanine.

01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:32.257
It's okay, Wally. I was stupid.

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.138
The truth was staring right at me.

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:42.350
Chuck, he wouldn't stop reading

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.644
even in bed.
[crowd gasping]

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.271
-[man #3] Oh, man.
-[woman #6] My god.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.606
And suddenly, everything was wrong
with the world.

01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:52.944
Poverty, racism, gentrification.

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:54.404
What an asshole!

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.906
Honey, why didn't you tell me any of this?

01:23:56.990 --> 01:24:00.243
It's so weird, Mom,
none of it bothered me.

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.412
[Jeanine] I had other things on my mind.

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:04.497
All I could think about...

01:24:06.082 --> 01:24:07.125
was him.

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:08.376
[crowd gasping]

01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:11.463
Him? Me?

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:17.093
Wally Spivak, I have been in love with you
since the night we met.

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:19.596
-[man #4] What is she talking about?
-[man #5] Honestly, I don't know.

01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:20.513
Really?

01:24:22.932 --> 01:24:23.892
Me too.

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:25.185
Are you kidding me?

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:28.438
Jeanine, you're not in your right mind.

01:24:28.521 --> 01:24:29.606
[Mrs. Mulholland] Who is he?

01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:32.484
[Tammy] He's a failed writer
from a really bad neighborhood.

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:33.526
I'll marry you, Jeanine.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:34.694
[crowd gasping]

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:35.695
What?

01:24:36.696 --> 01:24:38.406
We wouldn't even have to get a new cake.

01:24:39.365 --> 01:24:41.284
We could just, you know...

01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:44.245
We could just walk in there and do it.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:45.622
Really?

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:48.541
You freed me, Jeanine.

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:54.214
You opened up my head and every thought
that's ever held me back just floated out.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.176
[Wally] I feel like I can see clearly
for the first time.

01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:01.763
[crowd gasping]

01:25:01.846 --> 01:25:02.806
Oh, my god. Will you marry me?

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:07.393
-No!
-No! -Yes!
-Yes!

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:15.110
Of course, I'll marry you, Wally.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:16.653
[groaning]
[Mrs. Mulholland] No.

01:25:16.986 --> 01:25:19.614
[dramatic music]

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.126
[chuckling]
You guys.

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:37.090
-I love you, guys.
-[Jeanine] Yeah.

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.883
[Kevin] Pretty fickle, Tammy.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.176
She's my best friend.

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.889
Hey, Tammy, you think we could hang out
with those Laker Girls?

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.307
You know, give it another shot?

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.518
Over my dead body.

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.567
[gong bangs]

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:02.031
[oriental Chinese music]

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:08.830
[fans rattling]

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.999
For centuries,
in the most primitive way, of course,

01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:13.585
I mean, culture has always allowed people
to adapt to their environment

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.004
in the most non-genetic way,
which I think is fantastic.

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:19.757
And I would like to dig deeper, you know,
kind of figure out what that's all about.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:23.344
Right? I mean, custom, belief, law, sex.

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:24.888
[Sasha] I mean, the list goes on, really.

01:26:24.971 --> 01:26:26.931
Conversely, culture can be bought.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.475
It can be taught,
it can be reappropriated.

01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:30.602
Uh, I just...
[smooches]

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:34.689
Authentically, I wanna get to the root
of why we're all here.

01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:37.066
[calm music]

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.492
Uh... Uh, hi.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.871
Sorry, I don't... I don't play.

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:51.331
It's okay.

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.499
I usually play by myself.

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.667
Oh, you speak English.

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:56.169
[Zheng] Yes.
[soft chuckle]

01:26:57.086 --> 01:26:59.214
You're American, right?

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.592
More and more so, it seems these days.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:06.804
I'm, uh, originally
from a little seaside town

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.473
in England called Brighton.

01:27:09.098 --> 01:27:11.017
I live mostly in Los Angeles now,

01:27:11.517 --> 01:27:13.353
Boyle Heights via Cheviot Hills.

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:16.439
It's near the Dodger Stadium.

01:27:16.522 --> 01:27:18.191
Oh.
[chuckles]

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:20.568
How's the book?

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:25.406
It's terrific.

01:27:26.449 --> 01:27:27.909
It's really wonderful writing.

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.119
[Chuck] By a friend of mine.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:34.165
Great guy, actually.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.251
He married my fiancée.
[Sasha mumbling nearby]

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:39.295
Do you wanna read it? I'm done.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:42.298
Yes. I'd love to. Thank you.

01:27:44.133 --> 01:27:45.301
"<i>Spivak</i>."

01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:48.012
[Chuck] I actually play
a pretty big part in it.

01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:49.555
Huh.

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:51.933
[fans rattling]

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:55.979
So...

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:58.690
wanna hang out sometime?

01:27:59.305 --> 01:28:05.617
