we can say about this man?

Said that the freak
had a good sense of humor.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.122
Which means
he's socially skilled.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.790
And from the way
he interacted with rusty,

comfortable with young people.

Was never charged

See you in a bit, rios.

12:07.359 --> 12:10.528
So, sharon's not even
coming to, like, say hello?

12:10.530 --> 12:12.263
She'd rather be here,
and you know it.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.500
But she's, uh, hunting for
the guy who tried to kill you.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.701
Okay, well,
why can't <i>you</i> come in?

12:16.703 --> 12:19.104
Just
for the beginning?

12:19.106 --> 12:20.538
Well, I-I-I can't listen
to you on the stand

12:20.540 --> 12:22.841
Because I'm involved
in this case, too,

12:22.843 --> 12:25.243
And hearing you could
get my testimony excluded.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.079
Okay, what happens
after I finish today?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.749
Do I get to go home?

12:30.751 --> 12:34.385
If rios can introduce

12:34.387 --> 12:36.788
All the threatening letters
against you as evidence

12:36.790 --> 12:39.357
And you do a good job...

12:40.626 --> 12:45.163
...Then, yeah, you can...
Maybe go home. Mm-hmm.

12:46.732 --> 12:51.870
And if the letters get --
what was the word you said?

12:51.872 --> 12:55.240
"excluded."
d-don't think about that.

12:55.242 --> 13:00.645
Look, um, this is definitely
not the advice I usually give.

13:00.647 --> 13:05.450
But when you get in there,
be   <i>completel</i>honest.

13:05.452 --> 13:10.622
Uh, if -- if you tell a lie or
even try to cover anything up,

She ran off

Look, if -- if you want to know
why my mom ran off,

15:47.981 --> 15:49.380
You have to ask her.

15:49.382 --> 15:53.384
But you'd have to
find her first.

Maybe 'cause you're up

How do you feel about

Your honor, I object --
I fail to see how the sad story

16:43.136 --> 16:45.103
Of russell's adolescence
relates to the charges

16:45.105 --> 16:47.338
Against my client.
Your honor,
if the defense doesn't plan

To ask rusty questions about his
time on the streets, then I --

16:49.209 --> 16:51.642
No, I never suggested
that the witness's character

16:51.644 --> 16:54.212
Should be off the table.
Ms. Rothman,
you're overruled.

Rusty, when you
found yourself alone

On the streets in los angeles,
how did you survive?

17:05.791 --> 17:08.059
Hustling.

17:09.328 --> 17:12.997
Mostly, I...I hustled.

17:12.999 --> 17:16.834
By hustling, you mean
engaging in acts of sex-for-hire

17:16.836 --> 17:20.371
With men who picked you up
on the street?

17:21.573 --> 17:24.008
Yes, that's what I mean.

17:24.010 --> 17:27.011
It was easy money,
and I was just trying to

17:27.013 --> 17:29.647
Find some way
for ryan and me to survive.

17:29.649 --> 17:33.251
And pay for your drug habit?
Yes.

17:33.253 --> 17:38.222
I was strung out back then,
but one night we met a man --

A nice man.
I thought he was a nice man.

what happened after that.

Sharon: It doesn't sound
that complicated.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.577
You needed heroin
and a place to stay,

17:59.579 --> 18:01.446
And you started sleeping
with henry jinks.

several letters of apology,

In case he ever found me --
part of my making amends.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.079

runs in the family, I guess.

19:08.081 --> 19:12.783
And what did you make amends
to ryan for in those letters?

19:12.785 --> 19:15.253
Henry stopped
bringing home drugs,

19:15.255 --> 19:17.922
Which was
very hard for me.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.827
So henry...

23:29.242 --> 23:31.742

to assist the prosecution.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.844
The people intend
to link those letters to --

23:33.846 --> 23:35.613
What you intend to do
and what you can prove today

23:35.615 --> 23:36.847
Are two different things.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.249
Neither the prosecution

23:38.251 --> 23:40.951
Nor the witness
may enter these letters

23:40.953 --> 23:43.554
Into the record during the
hearing if ms. Rothman objects.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.290
Let's keep it moving,
d.D.A. Rios.

23:46.292 --> 23:49.360
We still have several
witnesses to go.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.598
Your honor, this is normally
when I would ask if rusty

23:54.600 --> 23:56.801
Could identify the person in the
courtroom who tried to kill him,

23:56.803 --> 23:58.602
But, by sheer coincidence,

23:58.604 --> 24:01.405
Mr. Stroh has fallen ill
this morning.

24:01.407 --> 24:03.974
So, if I may
approach the witness...

24:06.311 --> 24:10.314
Can you point out
which of these six men

24:10.316 --> 24:14.185
Held a knife to your throat
and slashed your leg?

24:17.823 --> 24:19.156
Rusty:
Sure. It's number four.

24:23.662 --> 24:25.596
Let the record show

24:25.598 --> 24:30.334
That the witness identified
a photo of phillip stroh.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.336
No further questions
at this time, your honor.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.004
Ms. Rothman,
your witness.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.661
You didn't wait
for the police

24:57.663 --> 24:59.864
After your heroic 911 call,
did you, russell?

24:59.866 --> 25:01.499
No, I-I didn't.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.834
Your honor, let's listen to
the rest of the conversation

25:03.836 --> 25:07.171
Between the witness and the
emergency operator that night.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.106

25:09.108 --> 25:10.474
<i>Hey, what are you</i>
<i>looking at, huh?!</i>

25:10.476 --> 25:11.709
What are you
looking at?!

25:11.711 --> 25:13.110
Sir, are you
under the influence?

25:13.112 --> 25:15.713
No, I'm not under the influence!
Are you?!

25:15.715 --> 25:17.181
Or do you just not care

25:17.183 --> 25:18.649
That you have some killer
on the loose right now?!

25:18.651 --> 25:20.651
All right, sir,
the gps on your phone says

25:20.653 --> 25:22.286
You're actually
right across the street

25:22.288 --> 25:23.954
From the greek theatre.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.523
If you'll just
go stand by the box office,

25:25.525 --> 25:27.258
We'll send some
police officers to you.

25:29.294 --> 25:31.295
<i>Could you give me</i>
<i>your name and age, sir?</i>

25:31.297 --> 25:35.132
<i>Sir? Are you there?</i>
<i>Is anybody there? Hello?</i>

25:35.134 --> 25:39.570
An emergency worker <i>trained</i>
<i>to detect drug users</i>

25:39.572 --> 25:43.007
Over the phone
inquired if you were high.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.543
But, I-I wasn't, though.
Then why not wait
for the authorities?

25:45.545 --> 25:47.011
Because, obviously,
you knew that the police

25:47.013 --> 25:49.713
Would want to speak
with a sober eyewitness.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.550
I-I wasn't drinking
or taking drugs.

25:52.552 --> 25:55.986
Because underage hustlers never
do anything like that, do they?
Your honor, I object!

25:55.988 --> 25:59.523
Even if ms. Rothman is more
familiar with underage hustlers

25:59.525 --> 26:00.925
Than we're aware,
she can't make inferences

26:00.927 --> 26:03.394
About the witness
based on stereotyping.

26:03.396 --> 26:06.997
Sustained. Ms. Rothman,
the question about drugs

26:06.999 --> 26:09.266
Has been asked
and answered.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.771
When the police
finally caught up with you,

26:13.773 --> 26:16.206
They asked your age.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.908
And what did you say,
russell?

26:17.910 --> 26:20.110
That I was 18.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.080
But you weren't. You were 16.
You lied, didn't you?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.583
Yes, yes, I did, but only --
what else did you lie about?

26:31.590 --> 26:35.426
About having sex
for money.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.194
Aha. Okay.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.964
So, how many lies did you
tell the police altogether?

26:39.966 --> 26:43.534
Between 5 and 10?
Between 5 and 500?
I-I don't know.

26:43.536 --> 26:46.537
Well, you lied about what
you were selling on the streets.

26:46.539 --> 26:47.705
Did you lie about
why your mother left you?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.740
Did you lie
about being gay?

26:49.742 --> 26:52.276
Your honor, I object!
No one ever asked me that!

26:52.278 --> 26:54.445
No one ever asked me that!
The witness is a minor and any
question about his orientation

26:54.447 --> 26:58.549

but <i>completely</i> inappropriate.

Fine. Okay.

Look, when we first picked
rusty up, he lied about his age,

27:21.073 --> 27:25.109
Which makes me wonder -- if our
suspect is fixated on boys,

Maybe he lied
about his age, too.

still driving north.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.253
If you have patrol in place,
then you want to grab him

34:50.255 --> 34:52.089
Off the surface streets
before he hits chinatown.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.124
This is the time
to throw up your road blocks.

34:54.126 --> 34:58.061
Shut it all down now,
and ride the side streets.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.429
We can't let him
get away.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.931
Captain,
we're almost there.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.265
You might me to send
the amber alert for tyler lang?

35:02.267 --> 35:04.935
Not yet, lieutenant.
I want to locate weller

35:04.937 --> 35:06.903
Before the public
knows I'm looking for him.

35:06.905 --> 35:10.207
Instead of the largest
vehicle-containment technique

35:10.209 --> 35:12.409
Ever employed
by the l.A.P.D.,

35:12.411 --> 35:14.811
Why don't we just pull
the little whack job over?

35:14.813 --> 35:16.713
He's got a child with him,
lieutenant.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.415
I don't want to risk
a car chase.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.950
That boy's got to be
our first priority.

God. God.
Wade, it's not like
we're in a rush.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.873
It's probably just
an accident or something.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.708
I don't know.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.144
[ honking continues ]

36:21.146 --> 36:24.381
I think there's something
going on up ahead.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.152
All right, captain,
you have him two blocks south

36:29.154 --> 36:31.988
Of olympic on hope street --
if that's not too ironic.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.623
If you turn in the alley
off of pico,

36:33.625 --> 36:35.625
It looks like
there might be a parking lot

36:35.627 --> 36:37.861
Directly across
from where the suspect stopped.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.230
If you find him
before I get there, good luck.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.398
Thank you,
agent howard.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.400
All right,
lieutenant tao,

36:43.402 --> 36:45.635
Send out the amber alert
and get into position.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.204
Copy that.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.505
Julio and andy, go.

36:48.507 --> 36:51.308
If he runs and leaves
the boy behind,

36:51.310 --> 36:52.409
We are good to go,
everyone.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.643
Copy that.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.645
Oh, my god.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.882
This has to work.
This has to work.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.383
The amber alert
is now out to authorities,

37:00.385 --> 37:03.587
News agencies,
and about 400,000 cellphones.

37:03.589 --> 37:06.189

What's it say?

37:26.578 --> 37:28.878
Nothing.
Just, uh, get down, okay?

Wade,
what are you doing?

38:11.789 --> 38:13.423
Dude,
what is going on?

38:13.425 --> 38:16.993
Okay, just, uh...Stay here,
tyler. I'll be right back.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.862
Wade, you can't just go.
What are you doing?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.065

Cross fire! Damn it!

Stop! Move back,
or I'll kill him!

39:25.731 --> 39:29.499
I mean it!
I'll shoot this kid in the head!
Wade, please.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.900
Move back!
It's over, weller.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.970
Drop your weapon!
Let the boy go!

You want to see this kid dead?
Is that what you want?!

I don't have a shot!

He's too close
to the boy!

Move back!
He's too close!

39:42.881 --> 39:44.581
[ gunshot ]

39:50.821 --> 39:54.524
That created
some distance.

Oh, my god.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.561
Oh, my god!

40:10.408 --> 40:12.208
Last time I qualified
with my weapon,

40:12.210 --> 40:14.577
I scored a perfect target.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.947
Have your friends at,
uh, f.I.D.

40:17.949 --> 40:21.785
Come down and take
my after-action report,

40:21.787 --> 40:24.921
And I'll, uh, check in
with my union rep.

Excuse me.

going to solitary

40:56.121 --> 40:57.754
Until we decide
about his future,

40:57.756 --> 40:59.122
So you won't have to wear
that tie again for a long time,

40:59.124 --> 41:01.057
And it's the end
of your security detail

41:01.059 --> 41:03.460
Because we got rid of the guy
who was trying to kill you.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.062
Captain, I think f.I.D.
Is going to clear me

41:06.064 --> 41:10.233
As long your final report
ends up agreeing with mine.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.368
It will, lieutenant.
Don't worry.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.705
Rusty, how are you?

41:17.975 --> 41:21.110
Well [chuckles]
wasn't exactly a -- a fun day,

41:21.112 --> 41:24.514
But telling you, he knocked
the ball out of the park.

41:24.516 --> 41:27.250
No kidding. You did.

41:28.586 --> 41:31.588
Right.
Thank you, lieutenant...

41:31.590 --> 41:33.857
For everything.

Some of the questions
ms. Rothman asked maybe...

difficult memories?

No, it's not that,
sharon.

It's that, um...

Thank you for everything
that you've done for me,

But I...
[ sniffles ]

42:19.170 --> 42:22.705
I don't think I should
live with you anymore.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.841
Why?

42:24.843 --> 42:27.377
Well, because I don't think
you'll want me there.

42:27.379 --> 42:30.680
Rusty, why on earth
would you say that?

42:30.682 --> 42:32.382
Because I...

42:32.384 --> 42:36.386
I played chess
with that wade guy,

42:36.388 --> 42:38.388
And...

not the violent ways,

like wade weller.

and -- and maybe dr. Joe

who picked me up on the street.
