00:06.800 --> 00:08.995
*

00:31.490 --> 00:33.697
*

00:59.860 --> 01:02.124
This doesn't
prove anything.
ALIC_IA:
Of course It doesn't

01:02.160 --> 01:05.152
prove anything, and yet,
show that to a jury,

01:05.190 --> 01:08.751
and_ a million do|_|a_r suit
turns Into a $20 million one.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.826
And if I get it kicked
as prejudicial?
It's Judge Abernathy.

01:11.870 --> 01:13.098
You're representing
a deep-pocketed,

01:13.140 --> 01:14.698
big bad internet company

01:14.740 --> 01:16.662
who treated its employees
so poorly,

01:16.710 --> 01:18.803
three of them committed suicide
In a month.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.637
This one in his own cubicle.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.841
What side do you think
Abernathy will be on?

01:22.880 --> 01:24.700
You've changed.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.308
I have.
What happened
to that

01:26.350 --> 01:28.875
cute little housewife
that I used to know?

01:28.920 --> 01:30.842
When did she grow
to be so tall?

01:30.890 --> 01:32.858
(laughs)
You know,

01:32.890 --> 01:37.554
they say, you always kill
the woman terrorists first.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.399
The male on_es--
well, they hesntate.

01:39.430 --> 01:40.727
They fear death.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.591
Not the women.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.518
Then maybe
you should consider settling.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.595
I'll talk to my client.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.665
Good. Have you been well?

01:48.700 --> 01:49.928
I have.

01:49.970 --> 01:53.474
Oh, I heard there was another
turnover at Lockhart/Gardner.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.535
Yes. It's a new day.

01:55.580 --> 01:56.808
A new, new day.

01:56.850 --> 01:57.646
Sounds like
you have one

01:57.680 --> 01:59.443
of those things
every few months.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.368
Do they miss me?

02:01.420 --> 02:03.888
Oh, terribly, but then,
every time we end up

02:03.920 --> 02:07.515
on the opposite side of a case
from you, it eases the pain.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.324
Oh, and your husband-- oh,
I hear he's up by three points.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.884
He's doing quite well,
thank you.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.192
Playing the
race card.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.356
Oh, the suburbs,

02:14.400 --> 02:16.391
how they love
their white politicians.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.698
You are going to become a very
valuable commodity very soon.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.833
How's your daughter,
Mr. Stern?
Every firm

02:24.870 --> 02:26.838
in the city is gonna come
out of the woodwork

02:26.880 --> 02:27.904
trying to get their hooks
into you.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.874
Wife of the
State's Attorney,

02:29.910 --> 02:31.673
a practicing lawyer,

02:31.710 --> 02:33.348
and not bad to look at, either.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.268
Have a number to me by 6:00.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.515
Do nothing. Say nothing.

02:37.550 --> 02:40.849
We are three points up
with six days to go.

02:40.890 --> 02:43.779
The only way Wendy Scott-Carr
wins is if we mess up.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.527
If a reporter comes up to you,
what does everyone say?

02:47.560 --> 02:50.199
That's right. Nothing.

02:51.530 --> 02:52.736
Hello, Petra.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.567
What a glorious day it is today.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.794
How are you?

02:55.840 --> 02:58.400
Eli, you are so counting
your chickens.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.839
Why, whatever do you mean?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.939
I'm just sitting here, chatting
with my favorite reporter.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.948
So, what do you think
of the DCC suit?

03:03.980 --> 03:05.675
The DCC suit?

03:05.710 --> 03:07.541
I don't know.
What should I think?

03:07.580 --> 03:09.582
Did you have anything
to do with it?

03:14.690 --> 03:17.488
I am the first one to call you,

03:17.530 --> 03:18.781
aren't I?

03:18.830 --> 03:20.627
No. What are we talking
about here?

03:20.660 --> 03:21.797
The Democratic Committee

03:21.830 --> 03:23.366
has brought suit
against Wendy Scott-Carr,

03:23.400 --> 03:24.628
charging her with a lack

03:24.670 --> 03:26.968
of residency status.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.798
Get the DCC now!

03:29.840 --> 03:31.637
So, are you party to this suit?

03:31.670 --> 03:32.978
Are we party? No.

03:33.010 --> 03:34.875
In fact, we believe
that any question

03:34.910 --> 03:36.798
of our opposition's residency
is misguided.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.839
That's a... nice quote.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.871
Can you get me another one
from the candidate?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.740
What's your deadline?

03:41.780 --> 03:43.247
Well, online edition
in 20 minutes.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.848
I'll call you back.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.881
What the hell
were you thinking?!

03:46.920 --> 03:49.252
(choking)
You stupid bastard!

03:49.290 --> 03:51.520
Let go!
We're up by three points!

03:51.560 --> 03:52.959
And we're helping!

03:53.000 --> 03:53.898
No!

03:53.930 --> 03:56.660
Where did you go to school,
you idiot?!

03:56.700 --> 03:59.294
You stupid son
of a bitch.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.568
You novice!

04:00.600 --> 04:02.534
Wendy's husband's
not a resident.

04:02.570 --> 04:04.959
They spend more time
out of Illinois than in it.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.375
You gave her an issue!

04:06.410 --> 04:07.775
You gave her
a reprieve!

04:07.810 --> 04:09.801
The court
will invalidate her votes.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.976
No, they won't!

04:11.010 --> 04:12.511
A lower court will.

04:12.550 --> 04:14.415
Itï¬‚look
like machine politics.

04:14.450 --> 04:17.010
We finally positioned ourselves
as the enemy of the machine,

04:17.050 --> 04:19.917
and in one fell swoop,
you make it clear that Wendy

04:19.960 --> 04:21.689
is the enemy of
the machine!

04:21.720 --> 04:22.926
Well, what's done is done.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.427
No, it is not,

04:24.460 --> 04:26.496
because you're gonna drop
this suit and apologize.

04:26.530 --> 04:29.055
Say it came from some underling
with an itchy trigger finger.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.421
Too late.
I already gave a quote.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.330
You know, I don't have
many enemies in life.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.748
I get along with Republicans,

04:43.780 --> 04:45.748
Protestants, Catholics,

04:45.780 --> 04:47.475
even a few reporters.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.012
But the one
thing I hate

04:51.050 --> 04:53.814
is amateurs.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.983
Stern signed off on admitting
this video into evidence?

04:58.030 --> 05:01.022
Yes, but I don't think
he thought we'd end up in court.

05:01.060 --> 05:04.063
Well, it's now 6:00, and he's
not calling with a number,

05:04.100 --> 05:06.398
so_I think we're
ending up In court.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.429
It's probably
not a bad thing.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.097
If I were on this jury,
I'd want to punish someone

05:09.140 --> 05:10.960
for that.
Has she seen this?

05:11.010 --> 05:12.773
ALICIA:
No, but she knows I have it.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.004
DIANE: _
Best way to get It

05:14.040 --> 05:14.938
into evidence is
through her testimony.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.106
Can you prep her?

05:16.140 --> 05:18.074
You mean show this to her?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.543
You all right
with that?

05:19.580 --> 05:20.774
Yes.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.085
So, who else are we going to
use from the rest of the class?

05:24.120 --> 05:26.588
WILL:
The fired one with the kids.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.087
Emily Haas.
Yes.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.327
Thanks
for holding them together.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.051
I'll be right back.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.933
Do you need some help,
little girl?

05:41.970 --> 05:42.959
(high-pitched voice):
No, I'm good.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.136
(laughs)

05:44.170 --> 05:45.899
Where'd you
get these?
My sister.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.498
Do you remember Helena?

05:47.540 --> 05:48.905
She's staying
the weekend.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.999
She said to
say hello.
She did not.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.041
Well, she said
some other things, too.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.911
She doesn't still hold a grudge,
does she?

05:54.950 --> 05:57.145
No, no.
The first decade she did.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.454
She wasn't used
to people breaking up with her.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.048
She usually was
the heartbreaker.

06:01.090 --> 06:02.955
Does she think
it's weird we're...?

06:02.990 --> 06:05.379
She thinks
I'm competing with her.

06:05.430 --> 06:06.624
Well, then you've won.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.753
We've been with each other
longer than her.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.432
I got an offer to go to London.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.495
That's why I'm here.

06:15.540 --> 06:18.100
They want me to go to
London for the Olympics.

06:18.140 --> 06:19.300
Next year?
No.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.729
This year, to be their man on
the ground in the rev-up.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.145
Are you going?

06:23.180 --> 06:24.704
I don't know.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.809
Okay.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.044
I get it.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.741
Good.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.711
What?

06:30.750 --> 06:32.615
What are we?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.685
No.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.449
Should I go to London?

06:36.490 --> 06:38.879
It's a good opportunity.

06:38.930 --> 06:39.954
It's a promotion.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.819
And you want to go?

06:40.860 --> 06:43.693
That's the subject
under discussion.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.729
I need some help.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.441
I think I should go.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.199
Okay, then I think
that's a smart plan.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.548
When-When would
youleave?
Two weeks.

07:01.580 --> 07:02.171
Wow. Fast.

07:02.220 --> 07:04.040
Yup.

07:06.150 --> 07:07.617
Okay.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.457
See you.

07:09.490 --> 07:10.787
(murmurs)

07:24.940 --> 07:26.771
Morning.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.232
(classical music playing)

07:28.280 --> 07:30.145
You have the Aubrey
client meeting at 9:00.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.068
And the final contracts
on your desk for Thompson.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.146
I'll give you ten more minutes.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.740
Then I need you
on the phone with New York.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.480
(door closes)

07:50.130 --> 07:52.166
Yup.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.862
Stern is dead.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.006
Okay, who's doing it?

07:58.040 --> 08:00.031
Just keep me in touch.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.042
VVhen?

08:03.080 --> 08:04.240
I don't know.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.009
Sometime during the night.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.119
His secretary

08:07.150 --> 08:09.983
just found him this morning.

08:10.020 --> 08:11.942
(sighs)

08:11.990 --> 08:14.049
Well, that's the
end of an era.

08:14.090 --> 08:16.149
I kind of don't know
what to think.

08:16.190 --> 08:17.555
I mean,
he brought us together.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.626
Yeah. Then he took
half our clients,

08:19.660 --> 08:21.992
and he's been bludgeoning
us with them ever since.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.167
When's the funeral?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.566
Tomorrow. Just the family.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.535
But they're sitting shiva
for the week.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.168
Is it horrible of me?

08:35.210 --> 08:37.201
I don't know, but I was thinking
the same thing.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.673
We can grab our
clients back.
Yup.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.041
I already made a list.

08:43.220 --> 08:45.188
We can't call them now, can we?

08:45.220 --> 08:47.711
Well, that might seem...
opportunistic.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.318
What's the etiquette?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.885
Tomorrow. I mean, if we don't,
other firms will jump in.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.626
Other firms without
the same sense of restraint?

08:54.660 --> 08:57.868
We should call
on his wife and daughter.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.868
Sitting shiva?

08:59.900 --> 09:02.095
Sure.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.267
You think his firm's in play?

09:04.310 --> 09:06.232
Could be.

09:06.270 --> 09:08.306
That would be bad.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.547
Clients might stay put.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.811
(sighs)

09:18.320 --> 09:20.185
I'm sorry.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.188
I know.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.879
I mean, how awful.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.249
He was dead the whole night.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.996
Everyone thought

09:28.030 --> 09:31.124
it was just another one
of his all-nighters.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.637
The life of a lawyer.

09:32.670 --> 09:34.729
I don't want
to die like that.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.032
Then don't.

09:36.070 --> 09:38.038
Pamela Harriman.

09:38.070 --> 09:40.231
Now that was a death.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.840
Doing laps
in the Paris Ritz pool.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.302
Doesn't matter,
does it?

09:44.350 --> 09:46.978
I mean, we all end
up in the same place.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.887
All that's left is...
our Wikipedia entry.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.342
Well, you're a bundle of joy.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.350
(sighs)

09:58.390 --> 10:00.324
Stay healthy.

10:02.300 --> 10:06.293
*

10:13.280 --> 10:16.602
Okay, not too
opportunistic.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.071
(indistinct crowd chatter)

10:27.060 --> 10:29.051
I'm so sorry.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.292
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.274
Solomon Harwell. LSG.

10:47.310 --> 10:49.870
We had 11 million of
their business last year.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.241
Yes.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.874
And his son just
made it into Harvard.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.148
Solomon, how are you?

10:55.180 --> 10:56.647
Counselor, how are you?

11:02.990 --> 11:04.958
WILL:
We're a stronger firm
these days.

11:04.990 --> 11:07.129
The economy knocked out
some of our competitors,

11:07.160 --> 11:08.297
but we survived.

11:08.330 --> 11:11.197
Oh, I know. I always
liked you guys.

11:11.230 --> 11:12.788
But I'm waiting to see

11:12.840 --> 11:13.989
who's buying
Stern's firm first.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.291
Who's buying?
What do you mean?

11:15.340 --> 11:17.308
Stern was selling his firm.

11:17.340 --> 11:18.762
He was retiring.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.801
I didn't know that.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.971
Who was he selling it to?

11:26.050 --> 11:28.018
Mrs. Florrick?

11:28.050 --> 11:30.416
Funny to see
you here.

11:30.450 --> 11:33.180
Yes, funny.

11:33.220 --> 11:34.983
You knew Mr. Stern?

11:35.020 --> 11:36.351
I did.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.322
Not for that long.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.827
Just the last four months.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.725
He was helping me
become adjusted to Chicago.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.819
It's a sad day.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.419
Yes. Very sad.

11:46.470 --> 11:48.233
But I didn't realize,

11:48.270 --> 11:50.067
Mr. Canning, that you
were still here.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.759
I thought you went
back to New York.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.437
Oh, no, no, no.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.368
I like it here.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.071
Uh...

11:57.110 --> 12:00.375
In fact, I think we'll be seeing
each other in court again soon.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.376
We will? Why?

12:02.420 --> 12:03.387
Stern's last case.

12:03.420 --> 12:06.241
Uh, you're taking over?

12:06.290 --> 12:09.088
Well... I bought his firm.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.451
Every case, every client.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.921
Looks like we'll be
facing off quite a bit now.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.481
Wendy Scott-Carr is
an Illinois resident.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.284
This is her summer
home in Forest Lake,

12:42.320 --> 12:45.448
not in Michigan as the
Democratic Committee suggests.

12:45.490 --> 12:48.254
And why isn't
Wendy's team showing me that?

12:48.300 --> 12:50.518
'Cause they're three points
down, and they want the DCC

12:50.570 --> 12:52.299
to continue to shoot
themselves in the foot.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.491
They actually seem to be
shooting you in the foot.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.202
All the more _
reason to prInt It.

12:57.240 --> 13:01.233
I got a background quote that
Florrick has bimbo issues.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.575
Had bimbo issues.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.487
No, 1-1 think
I got the tense right.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.326
You're not
gonna prInt It.
Am I not?

13:18.360 --> 13:19.554
If it's untrue,
you're not.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.126
And we know this how?

13:21.160 --> 13:22.593
Because Peter is a reformed man.

13:22.630 --> 13:25.463
This is pretty convincing stuff.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.469
He, uh...
he slept with a coworker,

13:28.500 --> 13:31.560
and is actively trying
to hide it from his wife.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.579
And I hear the State's Attorney
has an investigator

13:34.610 --> 13:37.579
named Andrew Wiley
snooping around.

13:42.580 --> 13:45.515
There are some very
real human beings

13:45.550 --> 13:47.450
in this little drama.

13:47.490 --> 13:52.052
Yes, and I know that is always
your first concern.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.319
Get me a quote
from the wife.
No.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.169
Then I'll run
what I have.
You'll run a rumor.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.895
Half our newspaper
is a rumor.

13:58.930 --> 14:01.296
How do you think
news becomes news?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.467
Get Mrs. Florrick
on the phone with me.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.137
Maybe I'll run something else.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.536
Give me 48 hours.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.844
24.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.650
Thank you. Please.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.656
I didn't know

14:29.700 --> 14:32.498
Jonas Stern outside
of our few shared moments here,

14:32.530 --> 14:35.067
but it's always
worth a moment

14:35.100 --> 14:38.001
to reflect on how...
fleeting life is.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.031
How we really only...

14:40.080 --> 14:42.105
hold so much...

14:42.140 --> 14:45.041
sand in our hands.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.572
Tant' amara che poco

14:51.120 --> 14:52.519
Amway,

14:52.550 --> 14:55.451
I hear that negotiations
have broken down,

14:55.490 --> 14:57.481
and we're ready to go.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.623
Yes? Then let's call the jury.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.390
WILL: And when would you say
things changed, Mr. Yellins?

15:02.430 --> 15:03.692
YELLINS:
Well, about six months ago.

15:03.730 --> 15:06.198
After Kim Palmieri
took over as CEO.

15:06.230 --> 15:07.595
Kim Palmieri,
the defendant?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.699
YELLINS: Yes. It started
with little things.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.037
They closed
the employee break room,

15:11.070 --> 15:12.059
they cut our sick days.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.931
They laid people off
so the rest of us were forced

15:14.980 --> 15:17.574
to come in on the weekends
and take up the slack.

15:17.610 --> 15:20.147
The air conditioning was off,
so the place was an oven.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.977
Finally, I came in
to my office one day,

15:22.020 --> 15:23.146
and my desk was gone.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.487
Where did it go?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.987
They'd moved it
to the copy room.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.988
My supervisor, Kevin,

15:28.020 --> 15:30.659
made me gather my things
into a box and walk over

15:30.690 --> 15:32.578
to the copy room
with everybody staring at me,

15:32.630 --> 15:34.689
and that was
the most humiliating...

15:34.730 --> 15:37.267
Uh, so after that,
I couldn't go back there.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.494
I quit.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.532
No further questions.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.163
So...

15:46.210 --> 15:49.134
they, uh...
they closed the break room?

15:49.180 --> 15:51.000
Yes.

15:51.050 --> 15:54.110
I see. I'm... sorry.

15:54.150 --> 15:57.278
And the air conditioner being
turned off-- that was tough.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.481
Well, it was the idea
of-of working on the weekends.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.078
I understand.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.588
And this moved desk--
how far was that?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.281
YELLINS: Uh, I don't know.
The end of the building.

16:06.330 --> 16:09.049
And everybody's eyes
were on you?

16:09.100 --> 16:10.499
The whole firm's.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.669
That must have been humiliating,
with everyone...

16:12.700 --> 16:13.632
watching you.

16:13.670 --> 16:16.639
How-How far was it,
do you think, 50 feet?

16:16.670 --> 16:18.331
Um, I don't know.
Well, let's...

16:18.370 --> 16:20.372
Let's-Let's try it.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.401
Was it this far,
your humiliating walk?

16:24.450 --> 16:26.668
The one with everyone
staring at you?

16:26.710 --> 16:28.610
Uh, no, it was further.

16:28.650 --> 16:30.709
Okay, was it...
was it a straight line,

16:30.750 --> 16:32.513
or was-was something
in your way, or...?

16:32.550 --> 16:34.279
YELLINS: Uh, I don't think
you're getting the point.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.480
The point is that

16:35.520 --> 16:37.579
it was painful and humiliating.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.258
I mean, that's...
that's why you're suing.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.791
And I'm just trying to ascertain
the extent of your humiliation.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.196
Was it this far, your-your walk

16:45.230 --> 16:47.494
with everybody

16:47.540 --> 16:49.462
watching you?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.502
We need to hit the
videotaped hanging harder.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.666
Kalinda, what do you have?

16:52.710 --> 16:54.029
Their financials.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.104
The company claims

16:55.140 --> 16:57.370
they cut employee perks
because of the economy,

16:57.410 --> 16:59.776
but I found this buried under
a miscellaneous line item.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.210
Two point seven million

17:02.250 --> 17:04.138
paid to a company
called Haver Associates.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.317
A human resources consultant.

17:06.350 --> 17:07.658
They tell you
how to fire people.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.749
This should have been
turned over in discovery.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.326
Yup. Looks like
they were trying to hide it.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.419
Good. Stay on it.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.623
And so your husband
took his own life?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.662
Yes.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.497
He called me

17:20.540 --> 17:22.838
and asked me
to hug our daughters,

17:22.870 --> 17:25.100
to read them Goodnight Moon.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.835
He loved reading them that.

17:26.870 --> 17:30.545
And then_he took
an exten5|on cord,

17:30.580 --> 17:32.707
and stood on his desk
and hung himself.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.844
And you've seen the surveillance
video of your husband's suic...?

17:35.880 --> 17:37.745
Objection!

17:37.790 --> 17:39.087
Your Honor, Mr. Canning...
This is completely
absurd, Your Honor.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.257
It's decided.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.416
No, it's not.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.688
This was already settled.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.823
With another lavwer.
Your Honor?

17:43.860 --> 17:44.929
JUDGE ABERNATHY:
Over here.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.827
I find lawyers less aggressive
when seated. Please.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.693
Everybody, please
take a seat.

17:50.730 --> 17:54.393
And no leaning
forward.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.691
Everybody take
a deep breath.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.403
(people breathing deeply)

17:59.440 --> 18:00.634
(exhales loudly)

18:00.680 --> 18:02.807
Good. Mr. Canning,
let's start with you.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.376
It's prejudicial,
Your Honor.

18:04.410 --> 18:05.479
It's a surveillance video

18:05.510 --> 18:07.569
of Mr. Joyce committing suicide
by hanging himself.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.180
It serves no probative value,
other than to inflame the jury.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.711
Uh, Mr. Gardner,
Mrs. Florrick.

18:12.750 --> 18:13.853
It goes to pain
and suffering.

18:13.890 --> 18:16.518
Mrs. Joyce not only had
to suffer her husband's suicide,

18:16.560 --> 18:17.857
she had to see
the surveillance video.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.380
Because you
showed it to her.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.295
Uh-uh-uh. Mr. Canning,
you'll have your chance.

18:21.330 --> 18:24.128
_ WILL:
Mr. CannIng's predecessor
counsel, Mr. Stern,

18:24.170 --> 18:25.626
already signed off
on our evidence list.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.194
He had no objection
to this video.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.229
That's true, Mr. Canning.

18:28.270 --> 18:30.238
Why are we reopening
this particular can of worms?

18:30.270 --> 18:32.329
No, no. Don't lean forward.

18:32.370 --> 18:34.406
Just... I just have
to get something from
my case, Your Honor.
Oh.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.603
In going over our records
with our medical carrier,

18:37.650 --> 18:38.776
I discovered
several prescriptions

18:38.810 --> 18:41.574
for Donepezil made out
to Mr. Stern.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.281
It's a drug commonly
used for treatment

18:43.320 --> 18:44.548
of Alzheimer's
and dementia.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.911
It's a scourge of the elderly,
as you know.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.589
Yes. My nana suffered from it.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.781
She hardly knew me
at the end.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.798
Oh, that's terrible.
It was the same with my mom

18:53.830 --> 18:55.718
when I visited her
at the care center.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.829
IS there some reason for...?

18:58.300 --> 18:59.824
CANNING: I believe
Lockhart/Gardner
was aware of

18:59.870 --> 19:01.235
Mr. Stern's condition,

19:01.270 --> 19:03.568
and took advantage
of a disabled man

19:03.610 --> 19:05.635
who didn't know
what he was signing.
This is ridiculous.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.400
I had no idea
whatsoever, Your Honor.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.408
Mrs. Florrick?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.872
Mrs. Florrick?

19:11.910 --> 19:14.470
Were you aware of Mr. Stern's

19:14.520 --> 19:16.943
diminished condition?

19:16.980 --> 19:19.346
Your Honor, I...

19:19.390 --> 19:22.518
I regret
I can't answer that question,

19:22.560 --> 19:24.949
due to the bond
of attorney-client privilege.

19:24.990 --> 19:29.199
Ah. Well, then,
you leave me no choice

19:29.230 --> 19:30.959
but to read
between the lines here.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.560
Uh, Mr. Stern's
evidentiary agreement

19:33.600 --> 19:34.794
no longer holds sway,

19:34.840 --> 19:37.866
and Mr. Canning's objection
to the videotape is sustained.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.871
No, we're
keeping privilege.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.606
Okay, so hypothetically then.

19:45.650 --> 19:46.969
You're an associate,

19:47.010 --> 19:49.877
and a partner at your firm
asks you to represent him.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.841
Yes.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.915
And during the course
of that representation,

19:52.950 --> 19:54.611
you learn certain things
about that partner,

19:54.660 --> 19:56.651
and he instructs you
not to inform anyone.

19:56.690 --> 19:57.952
Including the
other partners, yes.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.025
Hypothetically in
that situation,

19:59.060 --> 20:01.722
I would be bound by that,
even after his death.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.991
Great. Stern's dead,
and he's still screwing us.

20:05.030 --> 20:07.396
(toddler giggling)
WILEY:
Here comes the monster!

20:07.440 --> 20:09.396
Oh, I'm gonna get you. (growls)

20:09.440 --> 20:10.839
Hey, thanks for dropping by.

20:10.870 --> 20:11.837
No problem, Wiley.

20:11.870 --> 20:14.009
What are you
investigating now?

20:14.040 --> 20:16.406
Uh, Childs has
me on a... Huh.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.748
Where did
I put that?

20:17.780 --> 20:18.872
What's your wife working on?

20:18.910 --> 20:20.719
Uh, a spaceship.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.342
(toddler squeals)

20:22.380 --> 20:24.348
For Richard Branson.
Virgin Galactic.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.381
She's designing
one of his rockets.

20:26.420 --> 20:28.752
Okay, why did
she marry you anyway?

20:28.790 --> 20:31.486
Because of my sense of humor.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.328
Hey, I want clothes on,
teeth brushed in five minutes!

20:34.360 --> 20:37.523
So Childs has me on this
last interview Blake gave.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.923
What do you mean?

20:38.970 --> 20:40.858
I mean, the investigation
into Kalinda Sharma.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.868
He gave one last
interview about her.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.037
To who?
Matan.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.628
I was supposed to
collate all these

20:45.670 --> 20:48.901
interview notes of his,
and this is what Matan sent me.

20:48.940 --> 20:51.272
It's, uh... it's supposed
to be five pages.

20:51.310 --> 20:52.902
Two are missing.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.679
Okay. Happens
all the time.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.609
He tell you anything
about the missing pages?

20:57.650 --> 20:59.743
Did Matan? No. Why?

20:59.790 --> 21:00.916
He said he did.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.952
Trying to catch me
in a lie, good buddy?

21:03.990 --> 21:05.958
Are you still protecting
your friend Kalinda, good buddy?

21:05.990 --> 21:08.652
It was my understanding
the investigation was over.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.691
The investigation's never over.

21:12.770 --> 21:14.965
(speed-dialing)

21:15.000 --> 21:16.968
Mr. Childs, it's
Andrew Wiley.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.002
Yeah, hold on. Let me
put you on speaker.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.338
Okay, uh, Mr.
Childs, you're on.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.699
I'm here with Cary.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.504
CHILDS:
Look, Cary,
the department is divided,

21:25.550 --> 21:28.371
so I need you two to find out
what's going on

21:28.420 --> 21:29.717
with these missing notes.

21:29.750 --> 21:32.048
I think Matan
is playing politics here,

21:32.090 --> 21:34.615
trying to pad his resume
for whoever takes over.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.389
You want us to
interview Matan?

21:36.420 --> 21:38.684
No, he'll say
it's just a mistake.

21:38.730 --> 21:43.326
I want you to find out
what's in those missing notes.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.496
Cary?

21:44.530 --> 21:46.088
Uh, yeah?

21:46.130 --> 21:49.998
Why did Matan say he talked to
you about these missing pages?

21:50.040 --> 21:52.008
I have no idea.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.909
Okay, find me these two pages
so we can wrap this up.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.578
(dial tone)

21:58.610 --> 21:59.577
(beep)

21:59.610 --> 22:01.919
RECEPTIONIST: Lockhart, Gardner.
Can you hold?

22:01.950 --> 22:03.918
(footsteps approaching)

22:03.950 --> 22:05.417
Hello.
Oh, hi.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.917
Did you see Will?

22:06.950 --> 22:07.882
No.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.717
Oh... do you want to?

22:09.760 --> 22:11.955
No, I... My sister
is staying with me.

22:11.990 --> 22:14.049
I just needed to get
out of the house.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.819
My sister used
to date Will.

22:16.860 --> 22:18.259
Yes, I know.
She was talking

22:18.300 --> 22:22.430
about Will breaking up
with her, and the reason
he broke up with her,

22:22.470 --> 22:23.903
and... the-the person

22:23.940 --> 22:27.603
he broke up with her for,
it's you, isn't it?

22:29.010 --> 22:30.136
Yes.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.740
Oh!

22:34.850 --> 22:36.772
I'm married.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.879
I've moved on;
Will has moved on.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.378
We're not kids anymore.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.081
I don't know;
Will still is.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.985
No. (laughs)

22:45.030 --> 22:46.657
He isn't.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.920
He think he is.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.060
Sorry, I'm late.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.931
KALIN DA:
I got it from
Haver Associates.

22:55.970 --> 22:58.768
The HR. consultants.
Yep. "In addition
to restructuring

22:58.810 --> 23:01.028
20% of human resources..."
DIANE_:_
Meaning fIrIng

23:01.080 --> 23:03.401
two out of every ten employees.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.839
...they said that Palmieri could
recognize "significant savings

23:05.880 --> 23:07.199
"if a meaningful
percentage

23:07.250 --> 23:11.186
of labor could be
induced to resign, rather
than being terminated."

23:11.220 --> 23:12.539
DIANE: Meaning
make people

23:12.590 --> 23:13.716
so miserable they'll quit,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.011
and you'll save
a bundle in severance.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.516
They did it intentionally.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.084
WILL: That's
the smoking gun.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.189
They deliberately created
a hostile work environment

23:20.230 --> 23:21.356
to get people
to quit.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.096
Well, with this, we can get
the hanging video back in.

23:24.130 --> 23:25.461
We can show that their conduct

23:25.500 --> 23:26.865
was designed
to make him depressed.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.164
We can do more than that.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.168
It's an intentional tort.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.166
That opens 'em up
to punitive damages.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.974
They made three people
kill thgmselves.
o...

23:36.010 --> 23:37.170
we'll make them pay for it.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.710
PALMIERI:
Is there anybody here

23:45.750 --> 23:48.014
who thinks Marty
is good at his job?

23:48.060 --> 23:49.880
Huh? Anybody?

23:49.920 --> 23:51.581
Aw, come on,
there must be somebody.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.598
Madelyn?
(clicks off video)

23:55.630 --> 23:57.689
That's quite a performance,
Ms. Palmieri.

23:57.730 --> 23:59.721
I admit, I can
be passionate.

23:59.770 --> 24:01.067
But as CEO, I'm responsible.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.965
Do you recognize this document?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.833
PALMIERI:
Uh, yes,
it's part of

24:05.870 --> 24:06.905
a consulting report
we commissioned.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.874
Can you read...

24:08.910 --> 24:12.038
that paragraph for us,
Ms. Palmieri?

24:12.080 --> 24:14.844
"In addition to restructuring
20% of human resources,

24:14.880 --> 24:16.040
"significant savings
could be realized

24:16.080 --> 24:17.809
"if a meaningful
percentage of labor

24:17.850 --> 24:20.148
could be induced to resign,
rather than being terminated."

24:20.190 --> 24:22.988
If you got people to quit
instead of firing them,

24:23.020 --> 24:24.157
you'd save money.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.555
No severance package,

24:25.590 --> 24:27.182
no benefits-- is that it?

24:27.230 --> 24:29.528
PALMIERI: It was one strategy
that was suggested by

24:29.560 --> 24:31.221
the outside consultancy--
we didn't follow it.
Did you know

24:31.270 --> 24:34.865
that six hours after your...
motivational meeting,

24:34.900 --> 24:36.891
Martin Joyce committed suicide?

24:38.840 --> 24:40.501
I did know that.

24:40.540 --> 24:43.907
No further questions.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.906
CANNING:
Ms. Palmieri,

24:45.950 --> 24:48.669
your management style,
it's a bit, uh...

24:48.720 --> 24:50.847
"confrontational,"
I think is what you said.

24:50.890 --> 24:51.982
It can be, yes.

24:52.020 --> 24:54.557
And in your experience, is
that is that unusual?
o.

24:54.590 --> 24:55.852
Times are tough.

24:55.890 --> 24:58.723
Employers face severe
financial restrictions.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.921
CANNING:_ So there's reason for
your being confrontational?

25:00.960 --> 25:02.996
PALMIERI:
Yes. If we don't
squeeze every drop

25:03.030 --> 25:04.759
of productivity
from our employees,

25:04.800 --> 25:07.837
we'll be forced to ship
their jobs overseas,

25:07.870 --> 25:10.168
wher_e labor costs
are con5iderably cheaper.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.862
So you were trying
to keep jobs in America.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.832
PALMIERI:
Yes, I was.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.147
Can I help you?

25:19.180 --> 25:21.978
You're being investigated.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.988
By?

25:24.020 --> 25:25.214
Andrew Wiley.

25:26.790 --> 25:28.087
(sighs)

25:28.120 --> 25:31.283
He noticed two pages
of notes were missing
from your interview

25:31.330 --> 25:33.753
with Blake.
Childs thinks
you're hiding

25:33.800 --> 25:35.654
something criminal, something
Blake told you about Kalinda.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.861
It's not criminal.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.663
It's personal.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.031
Okay.

25:43.070 --> 25:45.038
Personal to-to who, to Kalinda?

25:45.070 --> 25:48.073
Since when do you care
about protecting Kalinda?

25:48.110 --> 25:51.273
I don't. I care _
about protecting this office.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.572
What does Kalinda have to do

25:52.610 --> 25:55.909
with this office?
Not the current inhabitant
of this office.

25:57.350 --> 25:59.716
Kalinda and Peter Florrick?

25:59.750 --> 26:01.149
It's got nothing
to do with Childs.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.852
But if he gets ahold of it,
it's scorched earth.

26:03.890 --> 26:05.027
They had an affair?

26:05.860 --> 26:07.691
A one-nighter.

26:07.730 --> 26:09.254
Back when Kalinda
worked here.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.722
Blake had details,

26:10.770 --> 26:12.067
verifiable ones.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.261
Florrick will do anything
to cover it up.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.961
He promised to keep me
in this job.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.831
I need to tell Wiley
it's not criminal,

26:17.870 --> 26:20.805
but the problem is, is that he
may go to Childs with it anyway.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.331
So what do you suggest we do?

26:23.380 --> 26:24.779
CANNING:
Mrs. Florrick?

26:24.810 --> 26:26.903
Excuse me.
Mrs. Florrick?

26:26.950 --> 26:28.918
This is kind of awkward--
my, uh, my driver

26:28.950 --> 26:31.145
went home sick,
and I was wondering
if I could trouble...

26:38.690 --> 26:41.158
See, this is what
I love about Chicago.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.054
It's a real community.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.795
People helping
each other out.

26:44.830 --> 26:47.628
Your driver isn't really sick,
is he, Mr. Canning?

26:47.670 --> 26:49.865
Mrs. Florrick, there's
got to be a word for people

26:49.900 --> 26:52.039
who are always finding
hidden motives in things.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.264
Right? (laughs)

26:54.680 --> 26:57.774
I want you to come
and work for me.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.371
My new law firm.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.411
Fast-track to
full partnership,

27:03.450 --> 27:05.042
percentage of plaintiffs'

27:05.090 --> 27:06.887
contingency fees.
Why would you do that?

27:06.920 --> 27:08.387
Because you beat me
in court last time.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.058
No. Will and Diane beat you.

27:10.090 --> 27:11.421
(chuckles)
Well, you're cheaper.

27:11.460 --> 27:14.099
(laughs)
Probably doesn't hurt

27:14.130 --> 27:16.394
that my husband's
going to be State's Attorney.

27:16.430 --> 27:18.921
No, you're right,
that doesn't hurt.

27:20.970 --> 27:23.029
Mm-hmm.

27:23.070 --> 27:26.062
I don't think we're
a good fit, Mr. Canning.

27:26.110 --> 27:27.668
But thank you.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.678
Do you know the sign
of an immature person?

27:29.710 --> 27:30.904
When they can't distinguish

27:30.950 --> 27:33.248
between morality at home
and morality at work.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.419
Oh, is that...
is that me, now?

27:35.450 --> 27:37.918
I do what I need to do
at work to win.

27:37.950 --> 27:39.918
I go home,
I cuddle with my wife,

27:42.120 --> 27:43.280
about heroism and Heaven.

27:43.320 --> 27:46.323
And what do I do?
You go home
and feel bad about it.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.048
Oh, this is me.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.227
Thank you.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.928
It's a good job offer.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.403
Twice what you're making now.

28:00.270 --> 28:02.909
Think about it.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.071
*

28:11.090 --> 28:13.012
ELI:
You look deep
in thought.

28:13.050 --> 28:14.381
I was.

28:14.420 --> 28:17.014
You must be very happy.
Yes. Except
for the DCC

28:17.060 --> 28:19.426
trying to kill us 'cause
they're a bunch of idiots.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.928
The residency suit; I saw.
Yes, well,

28:21.960 --> 28:25.999
in the waning days of a campaign
the mudslinging can get...

28:26.030 --> 28:28.089
pretty ugly.

28:29.370 --> 28:32.134
Sounds like you're
preparing me for something.

28:32.170 --> 28:35.469
Petra Moritz,
the reporter,

28:35.510 --> 28:37.102
has a rumor.

28:37.140 --> 28:38.402
Okay.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.974
It's completely bogus,

28:40.010 --> 28:42.979
but she wants a quote from you.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.045
And the rumor?

28:46.890 --> 28:49.051
There_was another woman
in Peter's past.

28:49.090 --> 28:51.058
I wouldn't drag
you into this,

28:51.090 --> 28:54.799
but unless I can get you
on the phone with her,
she's gonna run with it.

28:54.830 --> 28:57.321
And I know I promised
never to ask you, but...

28:57.360 --> 29:00.067
Peter's so close.

29:00.100 --> 29:04.036
And this kind of rumor,
it could ruin us.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.132
I'll think about it.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.477
I need to know soon.

29:11.510 --> 29:12.772
I'll think about it.

29:19.150 --> 29:21.380
(people gasp)

29:33.400 --> 29:35.231
Nothing further, Your Honor.

29:37.470 --> 29:39.904
Mrs. Joyce...

29:39.940 --> 29:44.377
first of all, let me just say
how sorry I am for your loss.

29:44.410 --> 29:47.345
I mean, my wife means
everything to me.

29:47.380 --> 29:50.213
_ And I... I can't
imagine how you feel.

29:50.250 --> 29:54.084
Unfortunately,
this is a trial,
so I have to ask you

29:54.120 --> 29:56.452
some... tough questions.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.879
Ask away.
Were you and
your husband

29:58.930 --> 30:00.181
having marital difficulties?

30:01.600 --> 30:04.194
We'd had some issues,

30:04.230 --> 30:06.095
on and off, but we were
working through them.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.165
In fact, you...

30:07.200 --> 30:09.236
had an affair,
is that right?

30:09.270 --> 30:11.067
MRS. JOYCE: No.
I was unfaithful

30:11.110 --> 30:13.465
to my husband once,
on a business trip.

30:13.510 --> 30:15.171
It was hardly an affair.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.030
But your husband, he knew?
Your Honor,

30:17.080 --> 30:19.071
I think we've ascertained
the facts here.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.476
I'm inclined to agree.
Mr. Canning.
Of course, Your Honor,

30:21.520 --> 30:23.909
I'm just trying to establish
that there could've been
alternative causes

30:23.950 --> 30:26.089
for Martin Joyce's
suicide.
My husband was depressed

30:26.120 --> 30:28.486
because of how they
treated him at his job.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.317
But he was depressed.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.898
Did he seek treatment?
Yes. He saw our _doctor
and a therapist.

30:33.930 --> 30:36.251
And did those doctors prescribe
any medications?

30:36.300 --> 30:39.064
He prescribed
a number of drugs.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.931
Escitalopram, uh, Bupropion.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.528
None of them seemed to help.

30:42.570 --> 30:44.037
What about Elvatyl?

30:44.070 --> 30:46.334
Did he prescribe
a drug called Elvatyl?

30:46.370 --> 30:48.235
MRS. JOYCE:
Yes.
Mrs. Joyce, are you aware

30:48.280 --> 30:49.872
of the side effects
of Elvatyl?

30:49.910 --> 30:51.400
Objection, Your Honor.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.169
Okay, deep breath.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.178
This is a complete conflict
of interest, Your Honor.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.586
Mr. Canning defended the makers
of Elvatyl just last year

30:59.620 --> 31:01.212
in a lawsuit against us.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.182
And now he intends to pin
Mr. Joyce's suicide

31:03.220 --> 31:05.359
on the side effects
of his former client's product?

31:05.390 --> 31:07.278
Actually, that company no
longer exists, Your Honor.

31:07.330 --> 31:10.197
The rights to the name
Elvatyl were sold
to a new company,

31:10.230 --> 31:12.960
and I owe
them no duty.
And what evidence

31:13.000 --> 31:14.968
do you intend
to present? Uh...

31:15.000 --> 31:16.035
It's a video showing how

31:16.070 --> 31:18.561
Elvatyl results in violent
and suicidal behavior.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.168
Now, as you'll see...

31:20.210 --> 31:21.632
(excited squeaking)

31:21.680 --> 31:24.240
Your Honor, last year we had
exactly the same...
We had this very...

31:24.280 --> 31:27.078
Okay, okay, one at a time.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.270
(exhales)

31:28.320 --> 31:30.174
This is our exhibit,
Your Honor.

31:30.220 --> 31:31.915
We used it last year
in a lawsuit

31:31.950 --> 31:35.511
against Mr. Canning's client.
That's why they should have
no objection to me using it

31:35.560 --> 31:38.381
for the same purpose,
to show that Elvatyl
causes suicidal thoughts.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.454
This is outrageous, Your Honor.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.026
My goodness.

31:41.060 --> 31:43.051
They're really going at it,
aren't they?

31:43.100 --> 31:45.125
(rats squeaking excitedly)

31:56.240 --> 31:57.434
WILL: Look, I got
another hour here.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.505
I just want to
talk, that's all.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.677
So give me a call
when you get this.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.245
We still have the
other two employees
who committed suicide

32:04.290 --> 32:06.440
who weren't
taking Elvatyl.

32:09.590 --> 32:11.979
It's odd about Stern, isn't it?

32:12.030 --> 32:13.725
It was so sudden.

32:13.760 --> 32:17.196
Yeah. I saw him the day before.

32:17.230 --> 32:18.492
He seemed normal.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.492
Tammy?

32:25.410 --> 32:26.468
Yes.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.070
She talked to me the other day.

32:30.110 --> 32:32.044
Here.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.219
Her sister told her I was the
reason you broke up With her.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.070
I told Tammy

32:36.120 --> 32:38.486
there was nothing anymore.

32:38.520 --> 32:42.217
Whatever was between
us back then.

32:43.390 --> 32:46.052
Thank you.
It's complicated.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.058
(laughs)
I know.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.453
Everything is.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.627
Mm.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.592
KALIN DA:
Okay, who's Karen?

32:53.630 --> 32:54.733
Karen who?

32:54.770 --> 32:57.261
PALMIERI:
Is there anybody here

32:57.300 --> 33:00.030
who thinks
Marty is good at his job?

33:00.070 --> 33:03.073
Huh? Anybody?

33:03.110 --> 33:05.271
Oh, come on,
there must be somebody. Madelyn?

33:05.310 --> 33:07.505
Phil? What about you, Karen?

33:07.550 --> 33:09.279
KALIN DA:
The other names joined

33:10.750 --> 33:12.308
Karen Jennings.

33:12.350 --> 33:13.681
She worked
in the benefits department,

33:13.720 --> 33:15.779
and she was a friend
of Martin Joyce's.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.583
She didn't want
to join the class.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.985
Why not?

33:25.630 --> 33:27.621
(touch tones sounding)

33:29.470 --> 33:31.438
Thank you.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.461
Five minutes.
The key with Petra

33:33.510 --> 33:34.636
is to keep cool.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.272
She'll try
to get a rise out of you.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.744
(phone ringing through)

33:38.780 --> 33:41.112
Petra.

33:41.150 --> 33:43.118
Yes, Ms. Moritz,
it's Alicia Florrick.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.516
Ah, right on time.
I appreciate that.

33:45.550 --> 33:47.108
I'm here, too, Petra.
You have five minutes.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.287
Oh, Eli.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.753
Like a guardian angel.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.348
I better get started, then.

33:51.390 --> 33:54.291
So, Mrs. Florrick,
your husband cheated on you

33:54.330 --> 33:56.298
with a prostitute
named Amber Madison.

33:56.330 --> 33:58.798
Are you aware
of any other infidelities?

33:58.830 --> 34:00.388
No.

34:00.430 --> 34:01.533
Specifically someone
from his past.

34:01.570 --> 34:03.333
Maybe someone
that he worked with,

34:03.370 --> 34:05.065
or someone _
you both knew soaally?

34:05.110 --> 34:06.407
No.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.101
Because you're aware
that a source has approached me

34:08.140 --> 34:09.471
with what are claimed
to be substantiated

34:09.510 --> 34:11.569
allegations of sexual conduct?

34:11.610 --> 34:13.202
Mr. Gold informed me of this.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.377
I think the closer
we get to an election,

34:15.420 --> 34:17.376
the more the rumor-mongering
turns less into a sport

34:17.420 --> 34:18.580
and more into a strategy.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.588
Uh... tell me what
you mean by that.

34:20.620 --> 34:24.124
Voters are_ often moved
by last-minute rumors

34:24.160 --> 34:26.378
because there is
no adequate time to refute them,

34:26.430 --> 34:29.399
and so that's why
they become part

34:29.430 --> 34:32.729
of a strategy
to hurt your opponent.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.237
So, you believe

34:34.270 --> 34:36.591
that Wendy Scott-Carr
is behind these rumors?

34:38.270 --> 34:39.464
No.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.273
I think there are people

34:41.310 --> 34:43.130
who want
to hurt both candidates.

34:43.180 --> 34:44.408
So,

34:44.450 --> 34:46.372
your husband has sworn to you

34:46.410 --> 34:47.775
that there was only
the prostitute?

34:49.350 --> 34:53.138
I won't discuss
personal conversations.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.282
_ That sounds
like you're saying no.

34:54.320 --> 34:58.279
No, that's saying that
what my husband and I discuss

34:58.330 --> 35:00.480
is not your
business.
PETRA:
Because there's

35:00.530 --> 35:01.519
a private sphere
and a public sphere?

35:01.560 --> 35:03.551
Yes.
PETRA:
And

35:03.600 --> 35:05.898
if your husband
abused his office

35:05.930 --> 35:07.522
by sleeping with a coworker,

35:07.570 --> 35:09.788
and he lied to the people
closest to him--

35:09.840 --> 35:10.864
his wife and his children,

35:10.900 --> 35:12.333
do you think

35:12.370 --> 35:15.203
the electorate should trust him?

35:15.240 --> 35:16.434
Mrs. Florrick?

35:18.210 --> 35:20.201
So...

35:20.250 --> 35:22.468
let me ask you
one last question.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.182
Did you have an AIDS test?

35:25.220 --> 35:27.438
How dare you, Petra!
Go to hell!

35:30.960 --> 35:33.724
So keep my cool, huh?

35:33.760 --> 35:37.423
Yeah, I-I don't always
follow my own advice.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.373
Hey.

35:48.410 --> 35:50.378
What are you doing here?

35:50.410 --> 35:52.708
My job. You?

35:52.750 --> 35:54.741
I'm following you.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.918
Look... Wiley knows.

35:58.950 --> 36:01.657
He knows something's missing
from Matan's interview

36:01.690 --> 36:02.679
with Blake, and I know
Andrew Wiley.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.722
He's not gonna stop
until he finds out what it is.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.320
So, I talked to Matan again.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.328
He's sitting on it.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.918
As long as Peter wins,
he'll keep quiet.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.928
It's Wiley you have
to worry about.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.460
Why did you just say that?

36:14.500 --> 36:15.797
What?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.161
"As long as Peter wins."

36:22.610 --> 36:24.578
You know.

36:24.610 --> 36:25.770
Why didn't you just tell Alicia?

36:25.810 --> 36:27.607
If you just would have
been upfront with her,

36:27.650 --> 36:29.811
none of this would
matter.
Cary.

36:29.850 --> 36:31.909
Or is that why

36:31.950 --> 36:34.612
you became friends
with her in the first place?

36:44.500 --> 36:46.764
Work friends, you know.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.668
Were you aware that he was
taking anti-depressants?

36:50.700 --> 36:52.668
Mm-hmm.
You know,

36:52.710 --> 36:54.837
the defense have suggested

36:54.880 --> 36:57.508
that he might have
had a reaction

36:57.540 --> 36:58.939
to his last
medication.

36:58.980 --> 37:00.447
You mean the Elvatyl?

37:00.480 --> 37:01.742
Yeah.

37:01.780 --> 37:04.317
I-I don't see how.
He never took it.

37:04.350 --> 37:06.443
He...? How-How do you know?

37:06.490 --> 37:08.458
When he told me
he was going on it,

37:08.490 --> 37:09.616
I gave him articles
on the side effects.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.389
He got scared.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.421
Ms. Jennings, we're gonna
need you to testify.

37:13.460 --> 37:15.655
I don't want to get involved.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.868
Where do you work now?

37:18.900 --> 37:20.788
Where?
Yeah.

37:20.830 --> 37:21.660
Company fired you a year ago,

37:21.700 --> 37:22.928
so did you manage
to find a new job?

37:22.970 --> 37:24.506
That's none of your business.

37:24.540 --> 37:25.802
I was just wondering

37:25.840 --> 37:28.775
how you afforded the new
Mercedes in your driveway.

37:31.610 --> 37:32.975
(door opening)

37:33.010 --> 37:34.648
They looted the
pension fund.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.978
The executives--
35 million.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.715
That's why they were
so desperate to shed workers.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.651
ALICIA: It wasn't to keep jobs
from being sent overseas.

37:41.690 --> 37:42.759
They needed
to cut expenses

37:42.790 --> 37:45.281
so they could use their funds
to cover the shortfall.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.729
How do you know this?
KALINDA:
Karen Jennings.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.749
She uncovered the fraud

37:47.790 --> 37:49.826
when she was working in
the benefits department.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.327
She went to Kim
Palmieri with it.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.497
And Palmieri bought her off?

37:53.530 --> 37:54.758
It's criminal fraud.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.665
Maybe even a RICO case.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.702
Yeah, but it doesn't help us.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.298
Once it goes public,

38:00.340 --> 38:02.672
sure, the executives
will go to jail, but...

38:02.710 --> 38:03.870
The Feds seize
the company's assets.

38:03.910 --> 38:05.707
Yes.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.547
DIANE:
Oh, that's perfect.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.070
We're sitting on knowledge
of a massive fraud,

38:09.120 --> 38:10.769
and we can't do anything
about it

38:10.820 --> 38:12.549
because we need the company
to stay viable.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.387
Maybe we can do something
with it.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.465
MAN:
All rise.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.433
I... seem
to have misplaced my gavel.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.040
Uh, I hope that doesn't undercut
my authority here.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.049
Court is now in session.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.913
Do you have any more witnesses,

38:42.950 --> 38:44.781
Mr. Gardner?
Yes, Your Honor.

38:44.820 --> 38:46.117
The Plaintiffs call
Karen Jennings

38:46.150 --> 38:48.357
to the stand.

38:49.420 --> 38:51.115
Uh, Your Honor,

38:51.160 --> 38:53.481
this witness was not on the
Plaintiffs' witness list.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.828
WILL: Not by name, Your Honor,
but we specifically

38:55.860 --> 38:58.055
reserved the right to call
any former company employees,

38:58.100 --> 38:59.761
and Your Honor does like to err

38:59.800 --> 39:01.062
on the side
of admitting evidence.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.761
Uh, yes, I do.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.439
I also like to be unpredictable.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.538
And yet here I find myself
the height of predictability.

39:10.580 --> 39:12.798
Uh, I will allow.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.114
Your Honor, we'd like to ask
for a recess at this time.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.640
Oh, I think
it can wait until

39:20.690 --> 39:22.578
it's your turn for
a cross-examine, Mr. Canning.

39:22.620 --> 39:23.848
Your Honor... (clears throat)

39:23.890 --> 39:26.882
...we'd like to ask for a recess
to confer With opposmg counsel.

39:30.130 --> 39:32.394
Looks like the rocket ship's
coming along.

39:32.430 --> 39:34.022
Yeah. So, what's up?

39:34.070 --> 39:36.766
Talked to Matan.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.963
He stonewalled me, too,
but, uh, I think I-I
know what he's after.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.137
I'm just asking you
to show a little discretion.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.602
With?

39:47.650 --> 39:49.049
It's not what you think.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.412
It's-It's personal.
It's not criminal.

39:51.450 --> 39:53.088
But Childs will use it.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.087
Why are you
protecting her, Cary?

39:57.120 --> 39:59.156
I'm-I'm not protecting her.

39:59.190 --> 40:02.125
You went to see her
after you talked to Matan.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.663
What, are you following me?

40:04.700 --> 40:06.429
I'm doing my job.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.461
Just wondering why
you're not doing yours.

40:13.710 --> 40:17.032
The company executives
were looting the pension fund.

40:17.080 --> 40:20.174
Well, if that's
true, it's a problem.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.770
But it's also a
problem for you.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.447
You can't go to the
authorities with it,

40:24.490 --> 40:26.947
not unless you want to kiss
your settlement good-bye.

40:26.990 --> 40:29.151
Oh, we're talking
settlement now?

40:29.190 --> 40:30.179
It depends on the number.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.085
Without admitting anything,
it's gonna be hard

40:32.130 --> 40:33.882
for the company
to afford much

40:33.930 --> 40:36.194
without running out of money
to pay back the alleged fraud.

40:36.230 --> 40:38.892
Yes. Which is why
Kim Palmieri is going

40:38.930 --> 40:41.069
to make up the difference,
Mr. Canning, personally.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.465
Why would she do that?

40:42.500 --> 40:43.694
Because Karen Jennings

40:43.740 --> 40:47.699
kept a record of every executive
who took part in the fraud,

40:47.740 --> 40:49.833
and Kim Palmieri's
name is on that list.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.199
WILL:
So either she ponies up,

40:51.240 --> 40:53.105
or we'll see how
the US. Attorney reacts.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.869
My guess is he'll start by
freezing the company assets,

40:55.920 --> 40:58.718
and then he'll move
on to hers.

41:08.290 --> 41:11.123
Double the salary.

41:11.160 --> 41:14.129
You deserve it.

41:14.170 --> 41:17.264
I'm happy, but thank you.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.528
(elevator bell dings)

41:18.570 --> 41:20.128
Hey, get on.

41:20.170 --> 41:22.274
We'll talk about it
on the way down.

41:22.310 --> 41:23.777
No, but again,
thank you.

41:23.810 --> 41:25.004
I don't bite.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.245
(laughs)
Actually, I think you do.

41:27.280 --> 41:30.579
Look, this isn't
about your husband.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.185
I think you're a good lawyer.

41:34.220 --> 41:35.915
I also think you're
this close to being

41:35.960 --> 41:37.188
a great lawyer,
and Lockhart, Gardner

41:37.220 --> 41:38.619
is not gonna get you there.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.218
They encourage
weakness.

41:40.260 --> 41:41.989
And yet, we've beaten you again.

41:42.030 --> 41:43.520
(sighs)

41:43.560 --> 41:45.926
Do I look beaten?

41:54.580 --> 41:56.878
You called?

41:56.910 --> 41:59.276
You forgot your glasses.

42:02.180 --> 42:04.216
I won a case,

42:04.250 --> 42:06.309
and I realized

42:06.350 --> 42:08.853
I didn't have anyone to call.

42:08.890 --> 42:11.825
Who do you usually call
when you win a case?

42:11.860 --> 42:13.555
No one.

42:13.590 --> 42:17.890
Okay. Is this...
Is this going somewhere?

42:17.930 --> 42:22.594
A lawyer I know
died a few days ago,

42:22.640 --> 42:24.767
and it was like
he was never here.

42:24.810 --> 42:27.631
Everyone just went
back to normal.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.202
Death.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.549
I should sit down
for death, right?

42:37.120 --> 42:39.281
Don't go to London.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.982
I know it's selfish

42:42.020 --> 42:45.979
of me to say, but I don't
want you to go to London.

42:46.030 --> 42:48.658
Maybe you should go to London.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.224
Shut up. Shut up.

42:50.260 --> 42:52.262
It's your career.

43:00.370 --> 43:03.601
So what do we do now?

43:07.380 --> 43:09.575
I don't know.
