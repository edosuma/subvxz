Welcome, all,
to James Woods High's

00:38.305 --> 00:39.638
annual college fair,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.573
where each year,
our seniors gather to decide

00:41.575 --> 00:44.710
where they will go
in the fall to get HPV.

00:46.012 --> 00:48.580
Wow, Meg, so many choices.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.349
Yeah.
There's a state college

00:50.351 --> 00:53.218
with an incredibly offensive
Native American mascot.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.020
I'm Drunky!

00:55.022 --> 00:57.723
The Dakota University mascot!

00:57.725 --> 00:59.425
Look how drunk I am!

00:59.427 --> 01:02.394
This is important for sports!

01:02.396 --> 01:03.662
(gasps) Oh, look,

01:03.664 --> 01:05.497
you can go to Oral Roberts.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.201
PETER:
Oh, and there's Anal Roberts.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.438
Oh, boy, that is a tough,
tough place to get into, Lois.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.772
That is tough,
but once you're in there,

01:13.774 --> 01:15.841
you'd be surprised
how much you like it.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.109
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.243
So glad you could make it.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.711
You know, Meg has
attracted interest

01:19.713 --> 01:21.180
from several colleges.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.448
Meg going to college.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.616
I always thought she was
gonna be one of those ladies

01:24.618 --> 01:26.952
who wears a jean jacket
and hangs out at the bar

01:26.954 --> 01:28.620
in a chain restaurant.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.457
Hey. You know you can get
a slice of pineapple

01:31.459 --> 01:33.759
on your burger here.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.427
Hey, Jimmy, another water.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.795
I call Miller Lite "water."

01:36.797 --> 01:38.764
Jimmy knows me, he knows that.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.432
Come on, hockey team!

01:40.434 --> 01:42.601
This one's on me.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.703
Merry Christmas, Meg.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.605
You really think Meg
is college material,

01:46.607 --> 01:47.773
Principal Shepherd?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.808
Yeah, she's a solid B student

01:49.810 --> 01:51.208
and that's quite
an accomplishment,

01:51.210 --> 01:53.378
considering none of her teachers
are willing to sleep with her.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.247
Sophomore year,
she was molested by the janitor.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.081
Does that help?

01:56.083 --> 01:57.583
(laughs)
Mr. Griffin,

01:57.585 --> 01:59.985
I believe they're
called "custodians."

01:59.987 --> 02:02.654
Anyway, I was able to get Meg
an interview this weekend

02:02.656 --> 02:04.623
at Green Mountain College
in Vermont.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.991
Green Mountain College?!

02:05.993 --> 02:08.393
Oh, my God!
That's my first choice!

02:08.395 --> 02:10.229
Can one of you guys
take me up there?

02:10.231 --> 02:13.165
Meg, please excuse your mother
and I for a moment.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.800
We need to work out
our schedules.

02:16.169 --> 02:20.472
(Peter and Lois
punching, grunting)

02:21.908 --> 02:23.742
I'd be happy to take you, Meg.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.713
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to

02:28.715 --> 02:31.917
<i>Extreme Makeover:</i>
<i>Bethenny Frankel Edition.</i>

02:31.919 --> 02:34.720
CROWD:
Move! That! Bus!

02:36.523 --> 02:39.091
Put! That! Bus! Back!

02:39.093 --> 02:40.492
Hey, can you guys
turn that down?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.293
I'm trying to read.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.427
Oh, shut up, Brian.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.428
We were here first.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.697
Yeah, Brian,
go read in your own room!

02:45.699 --> 02:47.499
I don't have my own room.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.201
Yes, you do.
You have that wicker basket

02:49.203 --> 02:50.102
in the laundry room

02:50.104 --> 02:51.703
with the frayed bath mat in it.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.139
God, I can't get any
peace and quiet in this house.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.775
Well, now you know how
I felt at Mardi Gras.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.877
(applause, cheering)

02:58.879 --> 03:00.846
Hey! Keep it down!

03:00.848 --> 03:02.514
I'm trying to get
some sleep up here!

03:02.516 --> 03:04.449
MAN:
Show us your boobs...!

03:04.451 --> 03:05.851
My boobs?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.519
Wait, I-I don't think I...

03:08.821 --> 03:10.889
Oh, my! Jewelry!

03:10.891 --> 03:13.325
Ah, I wonder what I'll get
for showing this.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.728
The rules of this city
are very unclear.

03:19.899 --> 03:22.868
(sighs)
This is actually very pleasant.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.070
(crashing)

03:25.072 --> 03:27.706
Hey. Who the hell
knocked over the garbage ca...

03:27.708 --> 03:29.241
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.175
I-I don't want
any trouble.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.577
(laughs):
Well, you in the wrong place

03:31.579 --> 03:33.312
if you ain't looking for
trouble, boy.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.846
Nothin' but trouble out here.

03:34.848 --> 03:38.183
Big ol' hoot-owl come down,
scoop you up, take your eye out.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.685
All right.
Well, can you at least

03:39.687 --> 03:41.186
clean this stuff up
when you're done?

03:41.188 --> 03:42.754
It's... otherwise it's gonna
start to smell.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.190
Oh... you don't like
smell, huh?

03:45.192 --> 03:46.758
Well, sniff on this!

03:46.760 --> 03:47.859
(yells)

03:47.861 --> 03:48.927
(laughs)

03:48.929 --> 03:51.730
Yeah! You got that stink
all up on you, now!

03:51.732 --> 03:53.332
(maniacally barking)

03:53.334 --> 03:54.933
(screams)

03:54.935 --> 03:55.867
Oh, my God!

03:55.869 --> 03:57.169
What is that smell?!

03:57.171 --> 03:58.737
(barking continues)

03:58.739 --> 04:00.872
(yells)
It's like a burning tire dump

04:00.874 --> 04:02.174
right in my nose!

04:02.176 --> 04:03.575
(yelling)

04:03.577 --> 04:05.777
(hysterically crying):
Brian, why are you doing this?!

04:05.779 --> 04:07.746
We're sorry...!

04:07.748 --> 04:08.614
(Stewie yells)

04:08.616 --> 04:10.916
(Brian and Stewie
yelling, grunting)

04:10.918 --> 04:12.384
Ah! You bastard!

04:12.386 --> 04:14.086
(barking)

04:14.088 --> 04:15.087
(Brian grunts)

04:15.089 --> 04:16.888
I can't see!
I'm blind!

04:16.890 --> 04:17.956
(yells)

04:17.958 --> 04:20.592
(grunting)

04:20.594 --> 04:22.861
Ah! What is that smell?

04:22.863 --> 04:23.762
(barking)

04:23.764 --> 04:24.963
Oh, my God!

04:24.965 --> 04:26.932
Brian got sprayed by a skunk!

04:26.934 --> 04:28.367
No! Not against the wall.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.469
You're gonna scare off
the cockroaches.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.574
Oh, that's not good.

04:35.576 --> 04:39.444
They were 70% of the structure
of this house.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.981
Peter, please tell me this is
covered by our insurance.

04:42.983 --> 04:43.882
Sorry, Lois,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.218
it doesn't cover
acts of "dog."

04:49.756 --> 04:51.857
(plays rimshot)

04:57.797 --> 04:59.831
Hey, guys,
I-I think the tomato juice

04:59.833 --> 05:01.833
is really working. Don't you?

05:01.835 --> 05:05.604
No. You smell like my
six-foot-tall German girlfriend.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.807
Christopher, are you ready
to go to the Guttenschvartzen?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.175
Hell, <i>da!</i>

05:10.177 --> 05:13.245
She can swim across the pool
in two strokes.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.782
Wh... I don't know
what else to do.

05:16.784 --> 05:17.949
I do.

05:17.951 --> 05:22.154
Until the smell wears off,
you're staying outside!

05:22.156 --> 05:24.790
Outside? Lois,
I'm an inside dog!

05:24.792 --> 05:27.192
I'm an inside dog!
I'm sorry, Brian,

05:27.194 --> 05:29.995
but you stink.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.030
(chuckles)
I'll take smelling good

05:32.032 --> 05:34.032
over walking good any day.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.001
BONNIE: You don't
smell good, Joe.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.570
I'm sorry,
I thought I was alone.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.044
(shivering)

05:46.046 --> 05:47.479
Morning, Brian.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.681
Ew! You still
really stink.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.683
Yeah, you smell like
the meatball sub

05:51.685 --> 05:53.485
I left under the couch.

05:53.487 --> 05:56.855
<i>Damn it, I just gave away my</i>
<i>hiding place for meatball subs!</i>

05:56.857 --> 06:00.859
I-I'll tell you where there
definitely <i>aren't any meatball subs...</i>

06:00.861 --> 06:03.328
the side pocket of my golf bag.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.130
<i>Geez, Peter, shut up!</i>

06:05.132 --> 06:06.965
Did you sleep okay
out here, Brian?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.401
No! I was so cold.
And you have no idea

06:09.403 --> 06:12.204
how many terrifying things
there are out here in the dark.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.407
My nephew, Scrappy Brian, didn't
even make it through the night.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.042
(rustling)

06:17.044 --> 06:19.344
Hey, Uncle Brian, let's
go check out that noise.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.712
I don't know, Scrappy Brian.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.547
It might be better
just to stay put.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.549
Aw, I'm not afraid!
Let me at 'em!

06:24.551 --> 06:25.984
Let me at 'em!

06:27.920 --> 06:29.554
(screeches)

06:29.556 --> 06:33.058
Damn it! I told my sister
this wasn't a good weekend.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.867
Hey, Bri. How's
it going out there?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.869
Oh, boy, I need this cold air.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.438
They got the heat
cranked up so high in here,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.673
Lois is walking around
without a shirt.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.108
Oh, come on, Stewie.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.043
Hey, throw me a jacket
or something, huh?

06:52.045 --> 06:53.345
Nope. You'll stink it up.

06:53.347 --> 06:54.913
Also, since
you've been out there,

06:54.915 --> 06:57.249
I've stopped sneezing,
so this might be permanent.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.551
Well, at least throw me down
some food or something.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.286
Well, I'm afraid
I finished my dinner.

07:01.288 --> 07:04.089
All I have is a steak,
but that belongs to Rupert.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.958
Can I have it? I don't know,
that's a question for Rupert.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.094
You'll have to ask him.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.463
Uh... hey, Rupe.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.098
"Rupe"? Oh, no. No, no.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.366
No, this is already over.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.134
Come on, Stewie, I'm starving.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.103
Good Lord, Brian,
get a hold of yourself.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.738
You're in a suburban yard.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.707
What kind of dog
can't live outside?

07:22.709 --> 07:24.209
God, he's right.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.545
I'm a disgrace to my species.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.114
Like that gumball machine
traffic cop.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.451
(horns honking, alarms blaring)

07:33.953 --> 07:36.922
Oh, my God, O'Connor's
a disaster out there.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.591
It's not his fault. He was
a great gumball machine...

07:39.593 --> 07:42.027
they just shouldn't
have promoted him.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.299
Oh, I think we're
getting close here.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.767
Meg, what are you doing?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.435
Just letting the wind
wave my hand.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.437
Sometimes I like
to pretend that I'm flying.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.006
Plus, it tickles.
That's stupid.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.312
(laughing):
Hey-hey-hey...

08:00.314 --> 08:02.414
The wind wants my
hand to go back,

08:02.416 --> 08:04.015
but I'm not letting it.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.852
I'm stronger than it.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.120
Oh, my God, Dad,
you lost your hand!

08:09.122 --> 08:11.723
That's all right.
I can regenerate.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.330
(deep, evil voice):
My name is Retep,

08:18.332 --> 08:20.532
and I am evil.

08:22.535 --> 08:23.668
(stomach growls)

08:23.670 --> 08:26.004
Come on, Brian,
you can find your own food.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.006
Every animal finds its prey.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.180
♪ Love in an elevator...

08:35.182 --> 08:37.182
Dude! Check it out!

08:37.184 --> 08:38.149
(tires squeal)

08:38.151 --> 08:40.051
(flies screaming)

08:40.053 --> 08:42.621
All right, I can do this.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.700
Holy crap, I'm so much faster
on all fours!

08:55.702 --> 08:57.168
(grunting)

08:57.170 --> 08:59.371
What's that big rock
doing there?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.041
(sinister laughing)

09:03.043 --> 09:06.211
(bird chirping quietly)

09:06.213 --> 09:09.047
Now, go on, get out of here,
you little bastard.

09:11.517 --> 09:12.918
(crunch)

09:13.686 --> 09:15.487
(crunching)

09:15.489 --> 09:17.656
I did it.
I caught a bird.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.324
I caught a bird! Yes!

09:19.326 --> 09:21.526
Fear me! Aah...!

09:21.528 --> 09:23.595
Aah! I feel so alive!

09:23.597 --> 09:27.098
(exhales) I feel like a dude who
just touched his first vagina.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.067
Hey. Pound it.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.136
Cool baby.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.341
Well, I called and confirmed

09:36.343 --> 09:38.343
my interview
for tomorrow morning.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.679
I ordered you nothing.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.247
What else is new?

09:42.249 --> 09:45.250
(intro to "Night Moves"
by Bob Seger plays)

09:45.252 --> 09:47.085
Hey, "Night Moves"!

09:47.087 --> 09:49.421
At least there's one cool
person in this dump.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.523
I wonder who played this. I did.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.124
<i>You</i> played "Night Moves"?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.126
How would you even know
what that song is?

09:55.128 --> 09:57.128
From you. Dad,
I've been hearing that song

09:57.130 --> 09:59.898
in the backseat of your car
since I was a little kid.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.900
Huh. I never knew
you were listening.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.468
Never even knew you were there.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.971
Wait, were you that little
fat boy with the glasses?

10:05.973 --> 10:09.140
Yes, Dad.
I know a <i>lot</i> about you.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.242
You do? I know you're
afraid of guacamole.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.644
It's the devil's vomit.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.879
In the last election,
you voted for Mighty Mouse.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.248
Time to put the might-mouse
in the White House, Meg.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.284
And I know you love Augustus Gloop.
(giggles)

10:19.286 --> 10:22.120
And you hate Mike Teavee. Oh,
don't even say his name.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.289
And you know a lot
about me, right?

10:24.291 --> 10:28.093
♪ Out past the cornfields
where the woods got heavy ♪

10:28.095 --> 10:30.929
(motorcycle approaching) ♪ Out in
the backseat of my '60 Chevy ♪

10:30.931 --> 10:33.164
(motorcycle driving away)
♪ Working on mysteries

10:33.166 --> 10:35.233
♪ Without any clues...

10:35.235 --> 10:39.571
(sighs) Dad, sometimes I wonder
why you even had a family.

10:39.573 --> 10:41.606
I don't know, it's just,
I was dating your mother,

10:41.608 --> 10:43.908
I don't like the way condoms
feel, next thing you know,

10:43.910 --> 10:46.778
I got a mortgage, a kid, and a
crappy job at a toy factory.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.913
I thought you liked working
at the toy factory.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.750
Hell no. I always wanted
to be a podiatrist.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.818
Thanks to you, Dr. Griffin,
my bunion is healed

10:53.820 --> 10:55.587
and I can walk without pain.

10:55.589 --> 10:59.524
This isn't a joke. I once had
legitimate aspirations.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.693
You never got
to pursue your dream.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.762
No wonder you hate me.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.163
I don't hate you, Meg.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.765
You're my kid.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.536
Who had the chicken parm?

11:11.538 --> 11:12.937
Oh, that's my second entree.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.340
But you know what?
You have it, Meg.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.708
Thanks, Dad.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.177
Boy, after all this food,

11:19.179 --> 11:21.279
we're gonna have
a couple of "night moves"

11:21.281 --> 11:23.181
back at the motel later,
huh, Dad?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.717
Oh, absolutely. You know, that's
what this song's about, Meg.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.352
It is?
Oh, yeah.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.954
All of Bob Seger's songs are
about taking dumps at night.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.223
Uh, "Night Moves,"
"Like a Rock,"

11:32.225 --> 11:34.826
"Shakedown,"
"The Fire Down Below."

11:34.828 --> 11:38.096
"Against the Wind" was him
poopin' out of a car.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.065
Quick!

11:40.067 --> 11:42.300
Someone give me my notebook!

11:45.371 --> 11:47.072
Well, here we are.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.274
Oh, my God, Meg,
there's a keg party!

11:51.477 --> 11:54.612
Let's go. If we meet any
chicks, you're my daughter.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.386
Yes!
Yeah! College!

12:01.388 --> 12:03.221
Oh, God, I got to take a whiz.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.323
Yeah, I got to whiz, too.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.096
(giggles) Sword fight!

12:11.098 --> 12:12.497
Gonna get ya!

12:12.499 --> 12:15.834
You got a funny little wiener,
but you're a nice guy, Meg.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.669
This is great, Dad.
I know!

12:17.671 --> 12:19.437
I'm having even more fun
than when I...

12:19.439 --> 12:23.842
I mean, than when
we went Fiona Apple-picking.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.678
Dad, they're all bruised
and filthy.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.446
Yeah, these might be
throwin'-at-buses apples,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.448
not eatin' apples.
See, Meg?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.718
You can be in the flashback
'cause we're friends now.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.787
(wind blowing)

12:49.368 --> 12:51.102
Hey, Brian.
(sniffs)

12:51.104 --> 12:52.470
Hey, you don't even smell
like skunk anymore.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.805
Why are you still out here?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.640
There's nothing
inside for me anymore.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.908
I've moved on.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.143
(hawks, spits)

12:58.145 --> 13:01.112
There was a boo-ger
in that spit, wasn't there?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.113
Stewie, leave me alone.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.448
This is where I belong,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.316
out here in the wild.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.317
The wild?

13:06.319 --> 13:07.752
You're standing
on the driveway.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.054
Come on.
Hey, hey! Let go of me!

13:10.056 --> 13:11.556
(growling)

13:11.558 --> 13:13.958
I can't believe it.
You've become a wild animal.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.895
You're like that tiger
from Siegfried and Roy.

13:17.897 --> 13:20.832
Um, I think we all know
the answer to this,

13:20.834 --> 13:23.368
but should I get tested?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.707
(Meg and Peter laughing)

13:31.310 --> 13:32.477
You guys are back!

13:32.479 --> 13:34.445
Meg, how was your interview?

13:34.447 --> 13:35.847
Ah, we didn't go.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.348
I slept right through it.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.316
What?!

13:38.318 --> 13:39.317
Yeah, it was awesome.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.451
We stayed up all night partying.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.487
By the way,
if a girl named Rachel calls,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.923
it's a wrong number,
but do tell me that she called.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.491
Where's your wedding ring?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.593
Yeah, so we missed the
interview, so that's a shame.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.495
Meg, how could you
miss your interview?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.497
That school was
your first choice.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.933
(phone rings inside house)
I'll get it!

13:54.935 --> 13:56.334
It doesn't matter, Mom.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.769
Dad and I had a great time.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.304
We went to a party!

13:59.306 --> 14:01.873
We bonded for the first time
in our lives.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.508
It was just Joe.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.943
Meg, how could you blow
your chance

14:04.945 --> 14:06.678
to go
to your first-choice college?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.380
I can't believe
you would be so irresponsible.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.816
Hey, Meg, you want to huck
some water balloons at nerds?

14:11.818 --> 14:13.484
Sure!

14:13.486 --> 14:14.986
What the hell?!

14:14.988 --> 14:16.988
(giggles)
(mimics giggle poorly)

14:16.990 --> 14:19.557
We'll work on the laugh,
but you'll get there.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.626
To the Meg-copter!

14:24.396 --> 14:26.197
Huh, look down there.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.132
That looks like me
with a green shirt.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.801
He's murdering a lady.

14:29.803 --> 14:32.303
(Retep laughs sinisterly)

14:40.145 --> 14:41.246
Dinner's getting cold.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.847
I wonder where your father
and Meg are.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.917
They left for the movies
five hours ago.

14:47.519 --> 14:50.521
God, look at Lois picking food
from her teeth with her nail.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.257
Someone should tell her
she's a pig.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.491
Mom, you're a pig!

14:53.493 --> 14:54.926
No, you're not supposed
to actually do it!

14:54.928 --> 14:56.361
We were just talking here!

14:56.363 --> 14:58.429
Oh, now she's crying.
That's not what I wanted.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.431
Stop crying, you bitch!

15:00.433 --> 15:02.600
(groans) I got to get
Brian back in the house.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.269
It's just not the same
without him here.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.405
It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger
without an accent.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.840
It might be a tumor.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.808
(American accent):
It's not a tumor.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.415
Where are you two going now?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.618
We're going two places:
none of yo and beeswax.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.420
Clean slam! Come on, Meg!

15:22.422 --> 15:25.556
Meg, I'm glad you're having
a good time with your father,

15:25.558 --> 15:28.393
but don't let him distract you
from your priorities.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.229
Remember, you still have
a chance to get into college.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.797
Mom, we're just having fun.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.233
I've never had a good
time with Dad before.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.068
I'm just saying, it's not easy

15:37.070 --> 15:39.070
dealing with
your father's craziness.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.638
Believe me, this is no job

15:40.640 --> 15:42.907
for the family's
designated <i>schmendrick.</i>

15:42.909 --> 15:45.243
Trust me, Mom.
I know what I'm doing.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.644
That's what your father said

15:46.646 --> 15:49.447
before he took that walking tour
of Providence.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.249
This is where a homeless
man ate the finger

15:51.251 --> 15:52.450
of another homeless man.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.086
This is where some teenagers
beat a gay guy to death.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.056
This building used to be
Irish. Now it's Cambodian.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.325
And this is where fake
tour guides throw rocks

16:00.327 --> 16:01.926
and steal tourists' wallets.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.195
Oh, yeah, I read
about this part on Yelp.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.006
PETER (quietly):
Meg.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.509
Meg.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.713
Come on.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.716
(ostrich squawking)

16:26.919 --> 16:29.087
Come on, it'll be fun.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.625
(giggles)
Isn't this great, Meg?

16:34.627 --> 16:35.927
(panting)

16:35.929 --> 16:38.830
Sorry I forgot
to get you an ostrich.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.035
All right, Meg, you and me

16:44.037 --> 16:45.536
are gonna get
something pierced together.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.305
I'll get my ear done.
How about you?

16:47.307 --> 16:49.707
Um, I guess my ears
would be okay.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.309
Oh, come on, Meg,
you're my daughter.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.710
Nothing but the best for you.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.544
You're getting the works!

16:53.546 --> 16:55.279
Here, I want everything you got.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.348
Only the best
for my daughter Meg.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.683
Ah, look at that.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.284
You look like one of them
beautiful, troubled

17:00.286 --> 17:02.787
Scandinavian youths I've
seen on the porn sites.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.522
You like it? (muffled): Mm-hmm.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.057
Awesome. Come on,
let's go next door

17:06.059 --> 17:08.593
and get your mom a funny
refrigerator magnet.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.933
I got a piercing, too.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.740
Hey, Lois, guess who made
15 baskets in a row

17:22.742 --> 17:24.175
at the county fair.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.410
Some kid we beat up.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.011
Oh, what a great day!

17:27.013 --> 17:28.546
Had enough yet?
Yes!

17:28.548 --> 17:29.981
I don't know how you do it.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.883
Everything he does
is exhausting.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.819
Even something as simple
as going to the bank.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.687
Meg, you've probably wondered
from time to time

17:36.689 --> 17:38.756
how on earth I pay
for all my shenanigans.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.191
Well, I'm gonna show you.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.927
This is a robbery! Everybody
get on the (bleep) ground!

17:42.929 --> 17:45.029
If this bitch moves,
shoot him in the eye!

17:45.031 --> 17:46.597
Dad, I don't want to do this!

17:46.599 --> 17:48.733
You have to! Next week,
we're buying a zebra!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.735
But, Dad...
There's no time to argue!

17:50.737 --> 17:52.170
We got 150 seconds

17:52.172 --> 17:54.205
before the police respond
to the silent alarm!

17:54.207 --> 17:55.773
Now check those
bags for dye packs!

17:55.775 --> 17:57.608
(crying)

17:57.610 --> 17:58.776
Who's the manager here?!

17:58.778 --> 17:59.911
I-I am.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.579
(wailing)

18:01.581 --> 18:02.747
What are you doing?!

18:02.749 --> 18:04.348
You said if he moves,
shoot him!

18:04.350 --> 18:06.584
He's the only one with the
combination to the safe!

18:06.586 --> 18:08.753
It's blown! It's blown!
This whole operation is blown!

18:08.755 --> 18:11.055
I'll get the car.
Kill everyone else.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.356
You've got to help me, Mom.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.591
What do you want me to do?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.793
Please, take him back.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.261
I suppose I could, Meg.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.630
But a part of growing up
is learning how to handle

18:19.632 --> 18:22.567
a tough situation on your own,
like getting into college

18:22.569 --> 18:24.635
or breaking up
with your father.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.707
I guess,
but it's not gonna be easy.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.442
Well, life's not
always easy, Meg.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.644
Just ask an ugly Boy Scout.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.981
Scoutmaster Davenport, you want
to share a tent with me tonight?

18:36.983 --> 18:40.852
Oh, Billy, I like
you as a friend.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.992
Brian, you got
to get in here, man.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.294
I've been taking a break
from Lois's breast milk,

18:50.296 --> 18:52.463
and her boobs are enormous.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.732
They're like Jiffy Pop
just before the foil breaks.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.068
You should come check 'em out
before they get infected.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.637
Yeah, nice try, Stewie,
but I'm still not coming inside.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.672
But, Brian, I need you inside.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.808
I'm going crazy in here
without you.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.010
Please, I need my friend back.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.246
Look, Stewie,
I've learned something out here.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.615
You see, living in the wild,
I-I've realized

19:10.617 --> 19:12.650
that all the pain
I've ever had in my life

19:12.652 --> 19:15.653
has-has come from me always
trying to be something I'm not.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.656
I mean, I'm not a writer,
I'm not an artist,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.491
I'm not an intellectual.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.793
What I am... is a dog.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.831
And as a dog,
my place is outside.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.999
I'm sorry, Stewie,

19:28.001 --> 19:31.002
but nothing will ever
make me come back inside.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.070
(thunder crashing)

19:35.040 --> 19:38.309
Stewie, get the hell in here!

19:38.311 --> 19:39.677
(chuckles)

19:39.679 --> 19:42.947
That dog sure changed
his mind quick.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.020
Oh, Meg, there you are!

19:49.022 --> 19:50.221
Hey, let's put on
fake eyelashes

19:50.223 --> 19:51.856
and flirt with
people on the bus.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.659
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I can't go with you.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.228
Mmm, are you sure?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.896
I called Green Mountain College.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.331
They let me reschedule
my interview,

20:00.333 --> 20:02.166
so I'm gonna drive
back up there.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.368
It's time for me
to get serious about my life

20:04.370 --> 20:06.037
and take some responsibility.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.872
I don't like this Meg.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.473
I like the fun Meg!

20:09.475 --> 20:11.142
I thought we were friends.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.377
Dad, I don't need you
to be my friend.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.813
I need you to be my father.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.582
Well, that is too much
to ask, Meg.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.584
It's hard being a father.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.353
This is why that woman in Texas
drowned all her kids.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.388
I hate the passage of time!

20:24.390 --> 20:26.757
(sobbing):
My little girl's growing up!

20:26.759 --> 20:29.060
(crying)

20:29.062 --> 20:31.062
Yes, she is, Dad.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.730
Yes, she is.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.799
("Night Moves" begins)

20:41.607 --> 20:43.708
MEG: <i>I did get into
Green Mountain College,</i>

20:43.710 --> 20:45.910
<i>and contracted HPV</i>
<i>my first night there.</i>

20:45.912 --> 20:47.745
<i>I got nicknamed the Warthog,</i>

20:47.747 --> 20:50.815
<i>and, like the HPV,</i>
<i>it stuck for life.</i>

20:54.853 --> 20:57.014
