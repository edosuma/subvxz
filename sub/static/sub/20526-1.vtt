WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:07.272
- Hey Rex!
- It's me, your buddy, Horatio sanz.

00:07.274 --> 00:10.209
This is Ken davitian,
your... brothel buddy.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.211
- It's Bryan Callen.
- I heard what happened.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.446
- I heard about your accident.
- I'm sorry it happened.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.415
I've been working
on making amends.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.783
- And it's bumming me out, man.
- I don't know what to say.

00:18.785 --> 00:21.553
Go fuck yourself,
you piece of shit prick.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.123
I hope you die
and I hope you die slowly,

00:24.125 --> 00:26.792
preferably of a horrible
disease in your face.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.728
What doesn't kill you,
makes you harder.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.530
All right? High-five that.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.098
But better it happened
to you than me.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.300
Because you, fuck face,

00:35.302 --> 00:37.069
piece of shit prick
that you are...

00:37.071 --> 00:39.371
- I love you.
- You fucked my girl.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.274
Then I hope you get help.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.176
I actually stopped going
to the therapist.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.378
And you know what?
I am having a ball.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.714
I have unleashed the beast.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.550
I was taking a pee
and it started to burn

00:51.552 --> 00:54.386
what I did have was gonorrhea.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.655
I met somebody
in San Bernardino.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.090
Anal's only $200.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.391
So, how can you beat that?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.160
And guess who gave
it to my girlfriend?

01:01.162 --> 01:03.495
You did,
you piece of cunt fuck shit.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.397
When you get out of this
and you get better,

01:05.399 --> 01:08.200
we're gonna take our tour,
Tijuana down to Portland.

01:08.202 --> 01:11.737
Now, while we're broken up,
I'm moving out of this house...

01:11.739 --> 01:16.341
And I'm gonna get you back some day.
Fuck you.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.610
What? I'm coming, I'm coming.
No, I'm not "coming",

01:18.612 --> 01:21.146
I'm coming. I'm going.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.449
Another high-five.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.117
All right, buddy,
take care of yourself.

01:42.235 --> 01:43.802
Hi, I'm suzanna Murphy

01:43.804 --> 01:46.538
and this is my dissertation
on sexual addiction.

01:46.540 --> 01:50.242
We own you, we own you.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.877
- Turn around.
- Shut up.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.812
Shut up.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.515
I'm studying to become
a sex therapist.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.783
I'm studying sex psychology

01:57.785 --> 02:00.152
and the focus
of this dissertation

02:00.154 --> 02:03.622
is to objectively document
a sufferer of sexual addiction

02:03.624 --> 02:05.424
for the next ten days.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.660
In order to do so, we sent out
an ad via craigslist,

02:08.662 --> 02:12.331
received hundreds of applicants.
There was a $3,000 incentive

02:12.333 --> 02:15.534
for the subject to participate
in this dissertation

02:15.536 --> 02:19.271
and we have gone through a few follow-up
phone calls, some questionnaires.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.141
I think we finally
have chosen our subject.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.610
So, we're gonna go down
the street to the coffee shop,

02:24.612 --> 02:27.212
meet with them, I'm gonna
bring my cameraman along

02:27.214 --> 02:29.148
just in case, as a precaution...

02:29.150 --> 02:30.516
It is somebody
with sex addiction,

02:30.518 --> 02:32.451
we wanna make sure
we're careful.

02:32.453 --> 02:36.221
I also... more precautions...
Have my rape whistle.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.624
Haven't had to use it yet,
so fingers crossed.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.226
Also I made sure I didn't, um,

02:41.228 --> 02:43.162
ladyscape underneath
the armpits,

02:43.164 --> 02:44.930
didn't shave for
a couple of weeks as well,

02:44.932 --> 02:47.566
make it unrapey down there.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.569
Also, I can fake a lazy eye
that I found out

02:50.571 --> 02:52.237
at a party one time in college,

02:52.239 --> 02:56.208
to make myself more unattractive
to potential predators.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.677
So, we're gonna go down there
now, meet with our subject

02:58.679 --> 03:00.479
and get started, so, here we go.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.782
Okay, so here we are

03:03.784 --> 03:06.752
on suzanna Murphy's dissertation
on sex addiction.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.955
Right now, we're gonna go
meet my cameraman,

03:09.957 --> 03:13.325
and it looks like
he's right over here.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.427
- Hello! Good, how are you?
- Hey, how are you doing?

03:15.429 --> 03:17.963
- You got the camera going, huh?
- Yeah. Can you do me a favor?

03:17.965 --> 03:20.532
- Just introduce yourself before us here.
- Sure, sure.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.701
My name is Roger,
I'm gonna be your camera guy...

03:22.703 --> 03:25.270
- That was weird.
- I guess someone's beeping, huh?

03:25.272 --> 03:27.873
- Okay, I'm gonna give this over to you.
- All right.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.410
Perfect. All right, you ready?

03:31.412 --> 03:32.811
Yeah, we're meeting him in here?

03:32.813 --> 03:34.846
Yeah.
Um, we're gonna go meet Rex.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.716
He's our subject
for the dissertation.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.353
I've only been taking
to him via e-mail so...

03:41.355 --> 03:43.322
So it's almost like
a weird blind date.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.792
- Um, thanks again for being here.
- No problem.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.298
Okay... um...

03:53.300 --> 03:54.799
Why don't you post up
right over here?

03:54.801 --> 03:56.067
I think that'll be good.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.738
Jeez.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.340
Okay...

04:01.342 --> 04:02.507
How you looking, okay?

04:02.509 --> 04:04.243
Yeah?

04:04.245 --> 04:06.245
- Suzanna?
- Hey... Rex?

04:06.247 --> 04:07.613
- Yes. I'm Rex.
- Nice to meet you.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.914
Good to meet you.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.482
- I guess we'll get started.
- Okay.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.451
As you know,
this is a dissertation

04:12.453 --> 04:16.887
for my phd for sex addiction,

04:16.890 --> 04:18.757
and I really...

04:18.759 --> 04:21.994
I just really want you to feel
like you are in a safe place.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.795
You can be open and honest
with your answers.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.530
It's really important,

04:25.532 --> 04:28.467
'cause you know, the more honest
the better we're gonna be

04:28.469 --> 04:30.769
throughout
this whole process, so...

04:30.771 --> 04:32.304
Um, great. I'm gonna get started

04:32.306 --> 04:33.972
and just ask you
a couple of questions...

04:33.974 --> 04:35.073
- Okay.
- If that's okay.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.942
Can you tell me, around...

04:36.944 --> 04:38.777
What the age was that
you first lost

04:38.779 --> 04:42.547
your virginity and what that
experience was like for you.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.419
It wa...

04:47.421 --> 04:49.288
How old are you
in middle school?

04:49.290 --> 04:51.023
- I'm sorry?
- Middle school?

04:51.025 --> 04:54.493
About what age is that? 13, 14?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.494
- Ish I believe, yeah.
- Yeah, let's go with that.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.998
Um, locker room, classic,
you know, kinda story...

05:00.000 --> 05:02.367
Walk in and... bam!

05:02.369 --> 05:03.902
It happened.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.504
I'm sorry, what happened?

05:05.506 --> 05:08.473
Bam! It happened.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.776
How did... you can't just...

05:10.778 --> 05:12.911
You're telling me that you
walked into a locker room

05:12.913 --> 05:14.545
- and you just...
- And things happened.

05:14.547 --> 05:15.580
- And you just...
- Yeah.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.082
There was no love involved.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.518
You... -i was hoping
there'd be love involved.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.753
- There was no affection.
- Okay.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.756
The coach was there, the students,
the teachers. - That sounds...

05:24.758 --> 05:26.525
- Wow, that's...
- The whole team.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.994
- Everyone was there.
- That sounds horrifying.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.030
It was horrifying.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.699
Are you okay? Are you okay to move
forward with this? - I'm good.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.767
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.336
Who was your first
sexual partner?

05:37.338 --> 05:40.038
- Um, her name was Rebecca.
- Okay.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.541
And she... wow!

05:42.543 --> 05:44.443
It was like riding
a rollercoaster.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.012
- Oh.
- Hey! You fucking ape.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.947
I told you never to fucking
speak about her.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.650
- I'm sorry, sir, can you...
- She asked me the question.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.218
Who are you? - You were never
supposed to speak about Rebecca.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.520
- I know.
- We talked about that.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.988
- I know.
- We don't bring her up.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.423
I know. I...
She asked the question.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.958
I'm trying to answer it.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.127
- Oh, okay.
- Do you understand what I'm trying to do?

06:02.129 --> 06:03.595
Don't speak her name.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.597
- I know.
- Hey, guys!

06:05.599 --> 06:07.499
- All right, this is... I'm just..
- Hey, guys!

06:07.501 --> 06:08.667
I'm working on my phd, right?

06:08.669 --> 06:10.836
Like, I'm not...
This is my first rodeo.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.438
What's going on?
Clearly you are not Rex. Rex!

06:13.440 --> 06:16.241
I don't listen to country music and
I don't know how to get to a rodeo.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.377
- I got the answers.
- Just go, just get out.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.845
You fucked up. You don't have the answers.
Please, leave.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.081
- I got better things to do.
- The jig is up, good-bye.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.685
I don't need to be here. - We spent
two hours last night and you're done.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.453
- I'm going home.
- You give shitty answers.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.988
- Eh!
- Get out of here, Disney.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.426
Hi, Rex.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.061
We haven't been formally
introduced yet.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.362
Why do you have a camera?

06:37.364 --> 06:39.831
Why do you?
I could ask you the same.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.400
- It's part of my dissertation.
- Little Ralph macchio over here,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.702
27 years ago before he broke
his ankle at the tournament.

06:44.704 --> 06:47.172
No one cares who that is
and no one knows who that is.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.134
Well, maybe you don't
because you're not American.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.744
I'm suzanna. Nice to meet you.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.080
Formal greetings. Is this the
hand you touch yourself with?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.048
Excuse me, what...
God, what are you doing?

06:57.050 --> 06:58.083
Jesus.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.620
Hey, can you keep it
down over there?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.455
I'm trying
to write my screenplay.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.823
No one cares about
your screenplay.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.291
Do me a favor
and take off your hood

07:06.293 --> 07:07.626
and your glasses, please.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.429
You're telling me
how to dress now?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.931
I'm asking you to be somewhat
professional for this.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.633
The unabomber look
doesn't do it for you?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.468
Would you walk into
a interview like that?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.470
- Don't answer that.
- Whatever.

07:18.472 --> 07:22.641
Thank you. Can we get started?

07:22.643 --> 07:25.110
Yeah, we can get started by
putting the money on the wood

07:25.112 --> 07:27.946
because I'm not gonna have
Ralph macchio over here

07:27.948 --> 07:31.616
fucking film me for free.
That's not the deal.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.120
Huh, cobra Kai?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.222
You still have nightmares
from that night, don't ya?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.758
Oh, my god.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.993
You get this now.
It's a quarter.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.497
You will get the rest upon completion of
the dissertation, is that understood?

07:45.499 --> 07:49.501
It is understood. Can you now move your
enlarged hand? - My hand is not enlarged.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.869
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's not.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.671
You could grip
a fucking basketball.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.873
Okay, that's not true,
and not to mention,

07:54.875 --> 07:57.809
it's been really hot out, and
when it's hot your fingers swell.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.944
It's not my fault.

08:01.581 --> 08:04.583
- I want U.S. dollars. I don't...
- You're getting U.S. dollars.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.151
I don't accept Saddam dollars.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.220
What does that even mean?
That's not a thing.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.789
Okay, I don't know
how you are a phd candidate.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.558
Okay, you know what?
Are we gonna be adults?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.394
- Are we gonna be professional adults?
- I'm trying to be. I'm trying.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.962
You are not trying to do anything
right now other than annoy me.

08:18.964 --> 08:20.766
I really am. No...

08:20.868 --> 08:23.034
Can you do me a favor
and please state your name

08:23.036 --> 08:24.736
and your addiction
into the camera?

08:28.207 --> 08:32.077
Rex... look, I know that you're
under a lot of emotional stress

08:32.078 --> 08:36.047
right now and this is difficult for you,
but you're gonna have to get through it.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.183
If we're gonna make it out of
this ten days alive,

08:38.184 --> 08:40.118
you're gonna need to start.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.554
Do this now.
We will continue tomorrow.

08:43.557 --> 08:47.125
- I'm Rex. I'm a sex addict.
- Oh, my god.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.195
And I will fulfill
suzanna Murphy's destiny.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.264
Call me tomorrow
when you can be an adult.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.999
God, I hate you.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.133
See you at 1:00.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.574
All right, guys, so, you know,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.109
I'm kinda particular
about my space,

09:04.111 --> 09:06.778
so, just be mindful
of the environment.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.149
I like... I kinda like my things
set as they are...

09:11.151 --> 09:12.351
Okay, we won't touch anything.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.856
How can I see...
How do I really... you know,

09:17.858 --> 09:20.559
you know,
this small little place,

09:20.561 --> 09:22.060
this is my jergens right there.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.062
Gotta have some jergens.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.865
- I think I use the same one.
- It's fun, it's fun.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.267
- A bong, guy, right there.
- Please, do not smoke anything.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.236
Do you need one?
I feel like she needs one.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.673
I think nobody needs any of
the pot right not. - Well.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.242
- I'm digitizing my fucking porn.
- Okay.

09:37.244 --> 09:41.012
This is little Jabari's fun
little toy right here. - Great.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.714
So, this is little Jabari.

09:42.716 --> 09:47.619
He keeps the house
nice and neat while I'm gone

09:47.621 --> 09:52.324
and I much prefer him
to my old weiner dog, Stevie.

09:52.326 --> 09:54.092
Don't you, Jabari?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.594
Don't you?

09:57.830 --> 09:59.331
I'm actually really thirsty.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.066
Okay, yeah, help yourself.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.500
- If you want anything, guy,
- okay.

10:02.502 --> 10:06.037
- Then grab something.
- Guy?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.940
- Okay.
- That's fine, So...

10:08.942 --> 10:13.278
So, why did you decide
to do a...

10:13.280 --> 10:16.014
You know, a dissertation
on sex addiction,

10:16.016 --> 10:17.148
the recidivism rate?

10:18.985 --> 10:20.952
Just what I wanted to do.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.789
It's gotta be some basis,
some curiosity...

10:24.791 --> 10:26.825
I don't think we need
to talk about me.

10:26.827 --> 10:30.629
- This is about you, Rex.
- Was mom running around town?

10:30.631 --> 10:32.697
Is that what mother was doing?

10:32.699 --> 10:34.799
- What was the mother reference about?
- Papa?

10:34.801 --> 10:37.636
- Where's papa?
- No one calls them that.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.740
It's hot in here. Getting tired.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.022
Why don't you
come sit over here?

10:47.113 --> 10:48.146
Like,

10:48.148 --> 10:50.682
God. Ow.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.319
Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, come...
I got you. I got you.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.154
Suzanna, I'm gonna
go to the bathroom

10:56.156 --> 10:57.856
- before we do this.
- That's a good idea.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.125
Good timing, guy.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.093
The juice
would wake me up, but...

11:02.095 --> 11:05.897
- The juice?
- The sugar.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.967
Mmm, I don't rec...

11:08.969 --> 11:10.769
Oh.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.937
The juice.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.940
So, this is my drink.
It's called seduce juice.

11:15.942 --> 11:19.244
I've been trying to patent it
for the last year and a half.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.012
They are giving me difficulties

11:21.014 --> 11:23.815
saying it's pretty much
a mix of nyquil and kool-aid.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.750
It's not 100% accurate, though.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.853
I think I'd love to take
this to "shark tank."

11:28.855 --> 11:31.723
Mark Cuban, I think
this is exactly for you,

11:31.725 --> 11:34.392
probably wouldn't sell in the
U.S. territories at this point

11:34.394 --> 11:37.295
somewhere more where they
encourage rape,

11:37.297 --> 11:40.932
like, I don't know,
Pakistan or ncaa sports.

11:43.936 --> 11:47.972
Okay, you're gonna go to sleep
for a while now, okay?

11:47.974 --> 11:50.208
Just go to sleep...

11:50.210 --> 11:52.077
Yes, yes...

11:52.079 --> 11:54.212
Look at this foot...

11:54.214 --> 11:57.449
You gotta a pivot foot like
vlade divac in his prime.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.818
I kinda like it.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.153
Picking you
for my center position...

12:02.155 --> 12:03.288
In rec basketball.

12:05.424 --> 12:09.828
You know, the sock is never
really fully appreciated.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.270
It's like the underwear
for the foot.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.299
I'm back.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.900
That was quicker
than I anticipated.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.302
Yeah.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.038
Mmm... what she was
saying before you left...

12:20.040 --> 12:23.208
Um, she was telling me
to relay a message

12:23.210 --> 12:26.111
tell guy to go ahead
and move on without me.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.345
I'm gonna kinda hang out here.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.514
Why is she asleep?

12:29.516 --> 12:32.317
She's tired,
she's had a long day.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.786
Why are you taking
off her shoes?

12:34.788 --> 12:37.322
So she'll be comfortable.
I mean, I don't like...

12:37.324 --> 12:39.157
Do you like sleeping
in your shoes?

12:39.159 --> 12:41.426
- No.
- Okay, makes sense.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.130
So go ahead. You can let
yourself out right now.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.465
- And...
- -I don't know if that's a good idea.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.067
Oh, I think it's a great idea.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.269
Um, suzanna?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.937
- What, dude?
- -Suzanna, can you hear me?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.873
Hey, quiet down
a little bit, okay?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.307
What do you need?
What's your angle?

12:56.309 --> 12:57.408
What's your angle?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.077
I mean, do you need
to participate?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.212
Do you wanna... do you wanna
shoot this shit?

13:01.214 --> 13:04.549
What do you want?
I'm usually my own camera guy.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.117
I kinda set up my own tripod.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.552
That's kinda my thing.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.421
But, um, you know,
if you wanna put a camera on me

13:10.423 --> 13:13.291
to get this transaction rolling
I can work with it,

13:13.293 --> 13:16.127
I'm not gonna make you
any promises, okay?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.463
But if that's what you need...

13:19.799 --> 13:21.032
Let me know.

13:21.034 --> 13:24.202
I am so...

13:24.204 --> 13:25.937
How long was I asleep for?

13:25.939 --> 13:27.138
For like an hour.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.406
What?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.241
Why are my feet so slippery?

13:31.477 --> 13:33.511
Somebody put lotion on my feet?

13:35.481 --> 13:40.218
You left me on the couch with...
With this sex addict?

13:40.220 --> 13:44.889
You can't just leave me alone
in his lair.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.058
Did you not see the things
that are around?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.294
There's an axe on the table.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.962
- I don't care...
- Hey!

13:50.964 --> 13:53.131
Hey, I made omelets,
do you guys want omelets?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.332
- No, we're fine, thank you.
- You don't want omelets?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.601
I'm really super full...

13:56.603 --> 13:59.070
From the juice.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.105
- Okay, you want any more?
- No.

14:01.107 --> 14:04.442
Hi, I'm Mary Carey,
former adult film star

14:04.444 --> 14:06.044
and politician.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.246
When I was 12,
I was jacking off to you.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.914
I don't know if that's possible.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.283
- Um, I would've voted for you...
- How old are you?

14:12.285 --> 14:15.520
Umm, I mean, how old do I look?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.523
Hmmm, I'm gonna go with 47.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.391
I have a Benjamin button
thing going.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.428
47 -do you think porn
desensitizes men?

14:23.430 --> 14:26.898
Um, I do think porn
desensitizes men,

14:26.900 --> 14:28.633
based off guys I've dated.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.502
So you do...
You, being a former porn star,

14:31.504 --> 14:35.206
you do take responsibility
for me having to...

14:35.208 --> 14:38.610
Jack off to a Daniel Pearl
beheading video just to get off?

14:38.612 --> 14:42.213
Um, I mean, well,
I don't think it's my fault,

14:42.215 --> 14:43.982
- but...
- Apology accepted.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.483
- Okay.
- I appreciate that.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.390
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.192
Oh, man, good.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.194
So this is it, huh?
It's where the magic happens.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.263
This is my office and
I thought it'd be a good idea

14:58.365 --> 15:01.199
to see me with human resources over here.
Don't mind her.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.934
- Hi, I'm suzanna.
- No, that's fine.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.903
Don't make her feel
like a full human being.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.571
That's terrible, Rex.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.372
- Here we are, man.
- Yeah, welcome, welcome.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.241
I'm so excited.
We get to see what you do.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.110
- Yeah.
- What... is it you do, exactly?

15:12.112 --> 15:15.480
What we do here, we sell
dreams, we sell aspirations

15:15.482 --> 15:17.448
and treasure chests
full of love.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.984
- Okay.
- And what that means is,

15:19.986 --> 15:22.153
do you hate people
that abuse puppies?

15:22.155 --> 15:24.355
- Yes.
- Great. Give us $30 a month.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.325
We will work to eradicate
puppy abusers.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.261
It's... it's a... we're a
non-profit organization.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.664
What else do we do?
We... let's see...

15:32.666 --> 15:34.065
What are you... you into...

15:34.067 --> 15:36.167
Um, "faces of death"?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.968
You know those great DVDs,
"faces of death"?

15:37.970 --> 15:39.337
They were for children,
I believe?

15:39.339 --> 15:42.073
What? A children's DVD
called "faces of death"?

15:42.075 --> 15:45.076
They're called "faces of death"
and you play them for children,

15:45.078 --> 15:47.445
and you educate them
about how life happens,

15:47.447 --> 15:50.515
and what happens if you take
the wrong turn, you might die.

15:50.517 --> 15:54.018
Well, I'm working on...
With one of our investors

15:54.020 --> 15:55.620
a series called "faces of meth."

15:55.622 --> 15:58.056
Much scarier.

15:58.058 --> 16:02.493
We are looking at increasing
breeding of parakeets.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.162
What do we have in this country?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.730
- We've got too much violence.
- Yep.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.465
- We have too much crime.
- Yeah.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.168
We have too much seacrest.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.569
I'll tell you that
much, my friend.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.004
Yeah, he's been
all over the place.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.572
But what do we not have
enough of?

16:14.574 --> 16:16.474
- Parakeets.
- Exactly, my friend.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.643
Do you wanna get some
of this on him, maybe?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.611
Hey, guy... you...

16:20.613 --> 16:22.180
You go ahead, come over here.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.350
I gotta show you something.
Check that out.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.652
- Oh, what is it?
- It's just a document...

16:27.654 --> 16:29.187
Oh, is it parakeets mating?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.022
No, it's something else mating.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.358
- Oh.
- Right?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.293
Okay, maybe we should
keep it a little...

16:35.295 --> 16:38.096
Yeah, yeah, that's what
it's all about right there.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.764
Hey, boss!

16:39.766 --> 16:41.466
What's going on in here?

16:41.468 --> 16:44.535
So, guv'nor, good job on
this recruit report, huh?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.739
- Way to sell that!
- Boss, what's up? Black power?

16:47.741 --> 16:50.408
- Rex, how are you doing?
- Hi, I'm suzanna.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.243
- Who the hell are you?
- So nice to meet you.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.078
I'm here to do my dissertation.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.646
Wait... wait,
what's all this about?

16:55.648 --> 16:57.648
Rex said that
you gave us permission

16:57.650 --> 16:59.384
to be able
to come and film today.

16:59.386 --> 17:03.688
Oh, to film. Yeah, no. No.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.391
Am I a valued member
of this company?

17:06.393 --> 17:08.226
No. Honestly, no.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.694
Just do your job. Get the
extra people out of here.

17:10.696 --> 17:14.332
- It's a fire hazard, it's a work hazard.
- Sir, really?

17:14.334 --> 17:16.300
If you wanna go back
to the homeland, keep it up.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.069
I'll send your ass
back there. Work.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.038
The homeland? Where does
he think you're from?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.806
That had racial overtones,
did it not?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.273
Yeah, it was a little weird...

17:23.276 --> 17:24.575
Let's celebrate diversity,

17:24.577 --> 17:26.544
why are we picking
on each other here?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.647
Except for her. Socialism,
let's work to eliminate that.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.116
Hey, Diego,
you're done with her?

17:32.118 --> 17:34.652
- Yeah, I'm done.
- Okay, cool. So what I need from you, sir,

17:34.654 --> 17:37.088
I need you to to get me
a partition right here.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.623
So that I no longer
see her face.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.793
- Okay, any color?
- That's maintenance.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.128
Diego, you don't need to worry
about that, darling.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.697
Well, go ahead and give
maintenance a call for me.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.332
I appreciate that. Thank you.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.169
- He seems like a good guy.
- He is a good guy.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.204
Her, not so much.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.207
Okay, all right,
do we have written...

17:56.209 --> 17:58.176
Authorization to be here?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.745
Because I don't think
I have any, anywhere.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.280
We have the verbal authorization

18:02.282 --> 18:04.549
and you know what,
in this country,

18:04.551 --> 18:08.486
the court of law, the verbal is just as
good. You can make verbal contracts.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.824
I'm not really fussed about this country and its
verbal crap. Okay, I need you to get out now.

18:12.826 --> 18:16.427
Can we just stop the socialist accent for
a second? - I just need you to get out.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.263
Yeah, well, I'll see you guys
back at the apartment. I'm sorry.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.305
- Off you go.
- -You see what I'm dealing with here.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.206
It's open.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.713
- Hey. Is Rex home?
- Hello.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.815
No, he's on his way
home from work.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.386
You look really familiar.
Do I know you?

18:42.388 --> 18:45.389
No.

18:45.391 --> 18:49.627
Aren't you the kid that tried to
tell me you were Rex the other day?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.329
Is that where I know you from?

18:51.331 --> 18:54.499
It was so long ago.
I couldn't even remember.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.400
It was yesterday.

18:56.402 --> 19:01.372
Anyways, he'll be home
any moment.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.441
Okay, um...

19:03.443 --> 19:06.377
Well, do you have a second?
I can talk to you.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.512
Okay.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.418
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.187
What are you working on?

19:16.189 --> 19:21.425
Oh, this... all these tapes,
this is Rex's sex box...

19:21.427 --> 19:23.895
- Oh.
- With tapes.

19:23.897 --> 19:27.598
Um, these are all the women
he's filmed having sex with.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.901
I'm just going through,
I'm labeling them.

19:29.903 --> 19:33.471
- They're all on vhs?
- Yeah. He's not really up to date.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.439
He's not the smartest
or the brightest.

19:35.441 --> 19:39.810
So my job, I'm taking everything
off vhs, running through it,

19:39.812 --> 19:43.748
checking it over and I'm putting
it digitally on a hard drive.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.716
And then I'm labeling it.
See this one?

19:45.718 --> 19:47.618
"Squirting cum fart."

19:47.620 --> 19:49.587
That's a completely
different category

19:49.589 --> 19:51.522
then just "squirting"
and "cum fart."

19:51.524 --> 19:53.891
It's "squirting cum fart"
all in one.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.326
One hard drive.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.827
- See where I'm going?
- Yeah.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.697
- A lot of organization going on.
- Sure.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.098
Could you print up
a label for me?

20:01.100 --> 20:03.334
Yeah, what is this one
gonna say?

20:03.336 --> 20:06.237
"Dick knocker."

20:06.239 --> 20:09.440
- That's d-i-c...
- I know how to spell it.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.709
So I've been interning
for him for I think...

20:11.711 --> 20:12.810
Is it one word or two?

20:12.812 --> 20:14.812
- One word. Yeah.
- Okay.

20:14.814 --> 20:18.616
- You're in school right now.
- I am, I am. I'm a junior.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.418
Oh, so you're how old?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.386
Um, we don't need
to discuss that.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.755
Just kinda working on
adult entertainment.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.257
I think I'm an adult.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.959
Legally, I'm not, but...

20:27.961 --> 20:29.827
Okay...

20:29.829 --> 20:32.296
What are you... so you're doing
this for school credit?

20:32.298 --> 20:35.233
Yeah, yeah, I need one more
credit to graduate and...

20:35.235 --> 20:37.568
Well, Rex needed some help
with organization.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.371
And he told me that there
is a credit in organization.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.640
So I'm going to go
ahead and organize...

20:42.642 --> 20:45.543
- Oh, I see.
- These tapes.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.279
- You're here. What's up?
- Hey.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.247
- Hey, Theodore, how are you doing?
- What's up?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.415
How's the tapes coming along?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.017
Good, I'm halfway through them.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.986
I've only gotten
a few labels, though,

20:54.988 --> 20:58.456
'cause I gotta learn
how to spell these things.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.259
Well, learn how to spell 'em, man.
That's what Google's for.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.862
I know how to spell, but you got
certain things like "squirt-ti-ting,"

21:04.864 --> 21:06.697
like, it's more than
one squirt or something,

21:06.699 --> 21:08.699
- like, how many "I-n-g's?"
- It's an emphasis.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.434
It's more squirting
than regular squirting.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.669
What the fuck is an emphasis?

21:11.671 --> 21:14.038
It's an emphasis
in the squirting.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.340
Squirting and then
"squirt-ti-ting,"

21:16.342 --> 21:18.241
like you just said,
it's double the squirting.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.710
That doesn't work as a label.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.946
We can have volume one,
volume two, volume three.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.782
Put squirting squared,
I don't care.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.685
I'm trying to organize
this for you,

21:27.687 --> 21:30.254
- but you're not giving me any help.
- Don't be so hard on him.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.623
He's an intern.
He's only working for credit.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.626
Yeah, he's getting life credit.
Valuable life credit.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.328
- That's not a thing.
- It is a thing.

21:37.330 --> 21:40.298
When I was his age,
you know, 12, 13, 14,

21:40.300 --> 21:42.700
I did the same type of task
for other people.

21:42.702 --> 21:46.337
I told you my birthday like 10 times.
It was last week.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.672
That was mlk day, I think.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.073
I don't know what that means.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.909
Am I gonna get a credit?
Am I gonna graduate?

21:51.911 --> 21:54.045
You gotta ask yourself that,
I mean, I don't...

21:54.047 --> 21:55.813
I don't have
your progress report

21:55.815 --> 21:56.981
I'm not your teacher.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.516
You're getting life credit,

21:58.518 --> 22:00.384
which is more valuable
than anything.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.719
That's not gonna help me.

22:01.721 --> 22:02.987
It will, according to her.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.689
It's not gonna help him.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.590
- In life, it will.
- It's not gonna help him.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.059
I gotta graduate
to make it in life.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.760
I'm done. I'm done.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.795
Hey, you need to check
your tone, dude, seriously.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.598
No, you've been having
me watch all this porn.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.934
I've been teaching you.
There's a difference.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.037
I hope you haven't been
teaching him anything.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.940
I've been teaching you
how to be with women.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.343
- You're young...
- I'm gonna go back to school

22:25.345 --> 22:27.912
to learn how to do that
'cause this is a waste of time.

22:27.914 --> 22:31.048
I've been watching you fuck for
hours and hours. I'm done.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.683
I'm a fucking show stopper.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.452
I don't care what
that even means.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.253
- I'm taking this.
- You're not taking that.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.755
Yes, I am. I'm outta here, man.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.124
You need to do some soul searching, buddy.
Shut up, Rex.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.326
- You need to do some soul searching.
- Whatever, Rex.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.961
Hey, do some fucking
soul searching.

22:43.963 --> 22:48.032
Don't you ever show your face in
this town again, you hear me?

22:48.034 --> 22:51.402
You told him he was getting a life credit?
Yeah, a life credit.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.170
- That's not a thing, Rex.
- It is a thing.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.638
- It's not.
- Google it.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.975
There is such thing
as life credit, okay?

22:57.977 --> 22:59.977
It's work for experience...

22:59.979 --> 23:02.480
Do you think... -...So you
can be a well-rounded person.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.582
Really? Why don't you
try to tell him

23:04.584 --> 23:06.584
that he's working
for experience?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.753
I don't know what kind of deal
you have with him.

23:08.755 --> 23:12.423
- He's getting paid.
- Okay.

23:12.425 --> 23:14.658
In what, rubles?

23:14.660 --> 23:16.794
Rex, can you tell us
a little bit

23:16.796 --> 23:18.863
about your background, please?

23:18.865 --> 23:21.899
Um, I am persian.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.703
Of course, there's no country
called persia anymore.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.639
Jake Gyllenhaal has fucked
persians over

23:28.641 --> 23:31.809
for his fucking
portrayal of persians.

23:31.811 --> 23:37.815
I grew up in a very
white-centric area.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.950
I like to call them crackers.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.752
I don't think that's
appropriate.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.522
I think it is for the torture
that they put me through.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.290
Well, let's just refer
to them as caucasians

23:46.292 --> 23:47.992
for the purpose
of this interview.

23:47.994 --> 23:53.130
There's nothing Asian about
those caucasians, miss.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.865
I would get made
fun of for being

23:54.867 --> 23:57.134
the skin color that I have.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.502
Okay.

23:58.504 --> 23:59.804
I would get spit on.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.139
I would get called the n-word.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.442
At least call me a sand...

24:04.444 --> 24:05.609
No.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.445
At least be accurate,
is the point

24:07.447 --> 24:08.612
I'm trying to make here.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.947
I was an only child.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.849
My parents had me,

24:11.851 --> 24:13.784
probably in vitro.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.886
- Um...
- Did you say "in vitro?"

24:15.888 --> 24:19.623
Yeah. I'm just guessing,
because I was the only child.

24:19.625 --> 24:24.762
So I'm guessing that they tried
exceptionally hard to have a child

24:24.764 --> 24:28.232
and they had to have some help
through doctors... - -I understand.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.535
And the science community
and whatnot.

24:31.537 --> 24:34.505
I had sex with
a family friend's daughter

24:34.507 --> 24:36.507
which doesn't sound that bad

24:36.509 --> 24:40.578
but she was set to get married
in the coming weeks.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.546
How far away are your parents?

24:42.548 --> 24:48.552
Um. About 50 minutes away.
No traffic, so, I don't know.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.521
That's not bad. What time is it?

24:50.523 --> 24:53.524
That's not happening.
We're not gonna go.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.526
I think we should go over there.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.161
We're not gonna do that.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.996
I think we should go
and try to talk to them.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.531
I think this is
the perfect opportunity

25:00.533 --> 25:02.232
- for you to make amends.
- I'm saying no.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.168
You need to respect
my boundaries at this point.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.537
You have to respect
that I'm trying to help you

25:06.539 --> 25:08.873
and that this is part
of the process.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.275
You're trying to help yourself
and your fucking documentary,

25:11.277 --> 25:12.710
and your fucking dissertation.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.979
I already told you
I don't wanna talk about it.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.915
I'm not gonna go
see my parents, okay?

25:17.917 --> 25:19.783
I've tried to talk to them.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.720
You're not...
You guys can go ahead.

25:22.722 --> 25:26.056
Go ahead. I'll be sitting here.
I'm not going anywhere.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.193
I can definitively say to you
that I'm not going anywhere.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.029
Nowhe... I'm telling you,

25:32.031 --> 25:33.731
they're not gonna want
to see me.

25:33.733 --> 25:37.735
They're your parents.
They probably miss you.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.036
- Son?
- Hi.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.571
- Is that you?
- Mom?

25:40.573 --> 25:42.606
It's me. It's your son.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.049
You're my son? No!
We don't have a son.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.217
We don't.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.926
I am your son.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.227
I made a mistake.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.775
I made a mistake!

26:17.777 --> 26:19.076
How many mistakes did you make?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.078
Come on!

26:21.080 --> 26:22.646
- Please!
- Okay.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.982
- Okay.
- Come on.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.751
Come on, Rex, don't actually...

26:29.689 --> 26:31.956
You just told me to die.
That's mean.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.958
- Go to hell!
- Oh.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.093
- Do you understand?
- You go to hell.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.330
I'm in America.
I can stand wherever I want.

26:39.332 --> 26:40.831
I told you we can't go in there.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.634
Some people need
more time to heal and to...

26:43.636 --> 26:45.803
It's been about a year.
11 months or so.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.972
According to everything
I know thus far

26:47.974 --> 26:49.473
I think it might take
a little longer.

26:49.475 --> 26:52.309
Maybe you don't know that much.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.114
What are you doing?
That's my stuff.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.651
Do they normally
act this violent?

27:00.653 --> 27:02.653
No, they're not violent.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.688
I mean, I grew up
with guns in the house.

27:04.690 --> 27:05.789
Wait, what?

27:05.791 --> 27:07.124
Yeah, my dad. He hunts.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.859
We used to eat
venison all the time.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.527
Okay, that's not what
I thought you meant

27:10.529 --> 27:11.962
when you said
"guns in the house."

27:11.964 --> 27:17.067
Sometimes I wondered, though,
what I was eating, or... Who.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.902
Rex, you stay here,
I'll go get it.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.138
You are not welcome here.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.707
You are not.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.142
Fuck you guys.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.811
Forget you.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.879
- All right, whatever.
- I'm just gonna get the box.

27:29.881 --> 27:30.881
I'll go find new parents.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.049
Hurry up.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.754
I'm going! I'm going!

27:36.756 --> 27:38.188
Hey, guy, let's get outta here.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.091
I'm going! Rex, start the car!

27:41.093 --> 27:43.327
We're sorry!

27:43.329 --> 27:44.662
Jeez.

27:45.964 --> 27:47.898
I...

27:47.900 --> 27:49.066
I just need a minute.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.734
Yeah, yeah, take your time.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.938
I know family issues are really
tough to deal with.

27:57.108 --> 27:59.143
You know they're gonna
come around.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.277
Yeah. I'm sure they will.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.049
Let's see what I rescued,
shall we?

28:11.056 --> 28:14.191
"My neck, my back?"

28:16.696 --> 28:17.861
ugh...

28:17.863 --> 28:19.163
It was a hit.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.301
I was listening to s club 7
when that came out.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.436
I'm glad they returned it.

28:27.472 --> 28:30.040
- Oh my gosh. Is that you?
- Yeah.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.775
You're so cute.

28:31.777 --> 28:35.212
See, I knew at a young age
what that tongue was for.

28:35.214 --> 28:39.083
It wasn't for
the pleasure of foods.

28:39.085 --> 28:42.753
It was to pleasure women.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.755
Okay, I'm just gonna pretend

28:44.757 --> 28:48.392
you were using it on ice cream.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.862
- Sure.
- What is this?

28:51.864 --> 28:53.230
What is this?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.365
Is this an art project
that you did in school?

28:55.367 --> 28:57.201
This is something
that I used to do as a kid.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.002
I used to draw portals
all the time.

28:59.004 --> 29:00.237
They're like my escapes.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.406
Oh, were you a big Sci-Fi nerd?

29:02.408 --> 29:06.877
No, I just wanted an escape.
They're portals.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.279
You could also replace it
with vaginas and assholes.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.814
Those are also escapes.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.951
It really is very deep,
when you think about it.

29:13.953 --> 29:17.121
I think maybe we should
take that to the therapist.

29:17.123 --> 29:20.324
He'd have something
to say about it.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.127
I've always been drawing
that stuff as a kid.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.429
Well, they're
not exactly ink spots,

29:25.431 --> 29:28.232
but I'm sure they have meaning.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.101
What do they mean to you?

29:32.971 --> 29:36.306
That you really need
to see a therapist, Rex.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.276
I mean, you've been dealing with
this addiction for a long time.

29:39.278 --> 29:44.014
I'm surprised
that you made it this far.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.149
Yeah... barely.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.696
There's a mattress. Guys.
I think we're close.

29:59.698 --> 30:02.800
Oh god, I hope
that's not the one she uses.

30:02.802 --> 30:07.504
Does look like slightly used. I think I see
her there... - Is that her right there?

30:07.506 --> 30:09.406
Yeah.

30:13.244 --> 30:16.346
Hey, how much for the back door?

30:16.348 --> 30:19.183
- $7.50.
- $7.50. It's black Friday.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.884
No, it's not.

30:20.886 --> 30:23.020
You can roll with the joke,
Trudy, come on.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.321
What's with the cameras?

30:24.323 --> 30:25.856
- Oh, the cameras?
- Yeah.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.258
Um, good seeing you.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.860
Just ashed on you. I'm sorry.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.328
- You look good.
- Thank you.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.131
- Yeah.
- This is suzanna.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.200
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Hey, Trudy.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.868
What's this about?

30:37.870 --> 30:40.504
She's... yeah,
they're following us.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.473
- She's doing a dissertation?
- A dissertation, yeah.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.509
- Sex addiction.
- You know.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.511
- Wow, okay.
- So...

30:47.513 --> 30:49.880
Do you have a little time?
I'd love to talk to you.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.515
You know him better than most.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.183
All right.

30:55.453 --> 30:57.454
How'd you guys meet?

30:57.456 --> 30:58.856
He was dating a friend of mine.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.091
A co-worker of mine.

31:01.093 --> 31:04.394
She's actually the one
who got me started me in this.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.364
Oh, did you intend to become...
I mean, this is your...

31:07.366 --> 31:10.968
- Oh, god, no. I wanted to be a teacher.
- Really?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.502
- Yeah.
- What happened?

31:12.504 --> 31:14.371
Not a sex teacher?

31:14.373 --> 31:18.442
Not a sex teacher. No, I
wanted to teach little kids.

31:18.444 --> 31:21.545
It just kinda fell
into my lap and worked out.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.549
Literally.
Or you fell into their lap.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.118
- Yeah.
- Um...

31:28.120 --> 31:30.520
Still haven't gotten you
in my lap, though, not yet.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.055
Oh, you guys haven't
slept together?

31:32.057 --> 31:33.223
- No.
- No, we did not.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.192
Oh, that was pretty definitive.

31:35.194 --> 31:38.328
- No. I don't do ethnics.
- What? What?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.931
- You know that.
- Fucking racist. That's racist.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.100
No, it's not.
I'll do black people.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.103
I just won't do ethnics.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.571
We've talked about that before.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.240
- Tiger Woods?
- Yeah.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.109
- You would?
- He's black.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.144
- Sure!
- But he also has other parts in him.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.113
- He's Asian.
- But looking at him...

31:56.115 --> 31:57.614
Looking at him, you would say...

31:57.616 --> 31:59.149
I don't know what he is.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.651
- I would say black.
- Yeah.

32:00.653 --> 32:03.420
- Mulatto. Is that a cookie?
- Do we use that term?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.455
- Is that a cookie?
- It's Milano.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.925
To answer the question...

32:10.962 --> 32:12.963
- Yeah.
- You're right, though.

32:12.965 --> 32:15.265
- It probably has to do with...
- Yeah, yeah.

32:17.302 --> 32:20.103
Okay.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.139
Ahh.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.040
- Come on, really.
- Nothing weird about that.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.409
- You wish.
- You're...

32:25.411 --> 32:28.378
Any of you guys need tissues
or anything before we bounce?

32:28.380 --> 32:30.847
Yeah, I feel like I have stuff on my face.
Bring me a napkin.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.450
- You have a lot of stuff on your face.
- Can you get me a mint?

32:33.452 --> 32:34.818
- Will you get me a mint?
- A mint?

32:34.820 --> 32:36.620
- Or a lollypop. Thank you.
- Yeah.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.955
- Ready?
- Yeah.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.122
Let's go.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.691
Why, thank you, kind sir.

32:40.693 --> 32:41.693
That's what I do.

32:55.540 --> 32:59.242
- Rex. Hey!
- Oh.

32:59.244 --> 33:00.377
What are you doing?

33:01.713 --> 33:04.348
- Come on, man.
- What?

33:04.350 --> 33:06.916
Well, what did you think? We said
we were gonna come after you.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.085
We're obviously gonna follow
you whatever you're doing.

33:09.087 --> 33:11.521
Is there something going on?
Why are you guys running around?

33:11.523 --> 33:15.425
Well, we're your best friends
for the next ten days.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.363
Just stay away, please.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.531
- Okay.
- Just, quiet.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.167
- Like I don't even see you there.
- You won't even notice us.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.236
Clearly I can see
this guy's fucking light

33:26.238 --> 33:28.505
shining down
in my fucking fore...

33:28.507 --> 33:30.273
- Can you kill the light?
- Fine, fine.

33:30.275 --> 33:32.709
- Thank you.
- Thanks, dude. Thanks for...

33:32.711 --> 33:35.612
- You know... oh, my god.
- Who are we gonna go see?

33:35.614 --> 33:37.014
Um, some...

33:43.655 --> 33:46.590
So, what brings you out tonight?

33:46.592 --> 33:48.592
You.

33:48.594 --> 33:49.726
Yeah, I suppose.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.575
You can pick them up.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.210
- You wouldn't understand.
- I'm not here to judge anything.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.380
You wouldn't understand.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.250
Just make sure you wash those.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.418
I have hand sanitizer
in my purse.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.920
You guys, it's really not necessary
that you guys come with me.

34:17.922 --> 34:19.389
It's... suzanna.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.458
- You signed up for this.
- This is my private hour.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.027
- Doesn't matter.
- This is after 8:00.

34:24.029 --> 34:25.862
- I told you.
- This is after business hours.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.732
Open that door and let's
just get it over with.

34:28.734 --> 34:32.135
It's really not... tell her
something or something, dude.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.303
Oh, my god.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.438
- Hey!
- Rexie!

34:35.440 --> 34:37.440
Oh, you bring friend?

34:37.443 --> 34:41.645
- My favorite.
- Hi.

34:41.647 --> 34:45.081
A redhead, nice.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.248
Wait, wait, wait.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.583
What is with the camera?

34:47.585 --> 34:50.253
- Oh, sorry.
- No. No, no.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.788
It's fine, it's fine.

34:51.790 --> 34:55.092
He, um... we're doing
a film for my school.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.294
- Sex film?
- No, educational.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.129
You're doing a porn
for a school?

34:59.131 --> 35:03.100
- You're a teacher?
- Um... school.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.469
She can join us, we'll go ahead.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.771
Okay, honey, you come.
You're coming, you're coming.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.840
Come in, hon, come in.

35:09.842 --> 35:12.776
All right, camera boy.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.778
You convince her?
She's gonna come through?

35:14.780 --> 35:16.580
Oh no. No, no, no.

35:16.582 --> 35:17.582
Absolutely not.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.217
Thank you so much.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.120
Before you make
a definitive decision...

35:23.122 --> 35:24.754
Before you make
a definitive decision...

35:24.756 --> 35:26.189
It'll be so much fun.

35:26.191 --> 35:28.792
Let me just tell you,
these girls will do to you

35:28.794 --> 35:31.128
what you've never thought
was possible.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.864
No, I'm really fine... no.

35:33.866 --> 35:37.234
You lie, you'll enjoy. - I'm sorry, the
fluids that will run out of you are...

35:37.236 --> 35:38.735
It's like the water
of the buffalo.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.471
It would be like a...
The only fluid would be tears,

35:41.473 --> 35:43.340
so, I'm... I'm okay.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.008
- Oh, come on.
- No, you guys go have fun.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.943
Don't be shy.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.348
Girls! Stop it! Suit yourself.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.417
Yeah, you heard the man.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.553
- Don't be shy, honey.
- I pay you girls by the hour.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.321
Let's go. Suit yourself.
You're missing out.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.489
Have fun you guys. Have fun.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.024
- Touch my breast.
- No, that's fine.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.026
Touch her breast.
Touch her breast. Just once.

36:03.028 --> 36:04.394
They're really not real.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.663
They're so nice.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.931
They look great.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.368
- Oh, cool. Bye.
- Have fun, you guys.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.502
Okay.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.675
- Holy cow.
- What country are they from?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.310
Come on, you know
you wanna go in there.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.679
I think I need a t.B. Test.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.781
Don't be so prude. You don't
even wanna go in there?

36:24.783 --> 36:26.316
I'm not being prude,

36:26.318 --> 36:30.220
I just got manhandled
by three ladies of the night.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.689
Again, we can always use
three more holes.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.191
- No, I'm fine, Rex.
- Are you sure you don't wanna come back?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.561
I'm fine. No. Have a good time.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.864
- Come on, sexy rexie.
- Hear that? Sexy rexie.

36:40.866 --> 36:45.268
Sexy rexie. - I feel like Whitney
Houston in "the bodyguard."

36:45.270 --> 36:46.270
Okay.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.575
Suzanna, how do you know
you're straight?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.677
I touched myself
to Andy dick once.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.680
Or was that Jane lynch?

36:59.517 --> 37:02.786
I don't know.
How do you know you're straight?

37:02.788 --> 37:04.721
I don't know.

37:04.723 --> 37:08.858
- I just do.
- Yeah.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.327
I just do.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.563
What the hell was that?

37:16.301 --> 37:18.668
I don't know.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.403
I'm in Terri schiavo mode.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.539
I'm gonna be sleeping
for the next 30 years

37:22.541 --> 37:24.374
at the very least,
let me just say that much.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.910
Oh, my god. Are you serious?

37:26.912 --> 37:30.614
- Honey, you googled everywhere.
- Ew, you've gotta be kidding me.

37:30.616 --> 37:33.250
- There has to be more.
- That is not normal.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.719
Ew.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.520
Oh, come on.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.289
I can't keep going like this.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.557
One more time.

37:40.559 --> 37:41.691
It's okay.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.993
One more time.

37:42.995 --> 37:45.262
- Why you not wear goggle?
- Oh, my god.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.997
I hate goggles
because they're ugly.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.365
What your problem?

37:48.367 --> 37:50.367
It's in the eye.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.002
You googled in her eye.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.870
- Oh, no good.
- Listen, listen, listen.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.773
I am like a young black child
receiving his first hand gun

37:56.775 --> 37:58.475
with the serial number
scratched out.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.944
I don't know where
it's gonna be shooting.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.813
- You gotta wear the goggles.
- I don't wanna fucking wear the goggles!

38:03.815 --> 38:06.583
It's my eye. Fuck you.
Fuck all of you.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.451
Fuck you for coming in my eye.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.920
I need my briefcase.
I need my briefcase.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.423
It's very disrespectful!

38:13.425 --> 38:14.591
I need my briefcase!

38:14.593 --> 38:16.293
You're disrespecting my face.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.727
- I didn't mean to.
- Get out, go,

38:17.729 --> 38:20.063
- I need my briefcase.
- You get out of here.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.332
Get out!
I hate black cock anyway.

38:26.003 --> 38:28.805
- What...
- Can you get that?

38:28.807 --> 38:31.741
- No, you can pick it up.
- We're leaving the briefcase.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.810
- We're leaving all of it.
- Let's just get out.

38:36.681 --> 38:38.014
Keep walking.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.483
Come on, guy.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.352
So then you gotta use condoms.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.754
It's just not worth it.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.991
You shouldn't want... -well,
I don't, but if you do...

38:47.993 --> 38:49.959
I don't want aids face,
I don't want meth mouth,

38:49.961 --> 38:51.461
I don't want syphilis.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.096
- Not at all.
- Or herpes.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.432
No, "herps" would be a bad get.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.066
Especially when you
get it on your mouth.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.336
Don't... yeah. I mean, anywhere.

38:59.338 --> 39:02.605
I'll take anything outside
of the herps and the "hivv".

39:10.648 --> 39:11.915
Doctor.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.750
Rex, a pleasure to meet you.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.618
My name is Dr. Michael pariser.

39:15.620 --> 39:20.957
I am a doctorate in psychology
and a licensed psychologist.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.560
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:23.562 --> 39:27.764
How are you, doctor? - Well, I'm
okay, but here's a better question.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.033
How are you
and what brings you here?

39:30.035 --> 39:35.739
Um, I have a bit of
an addiction to all things sex.

39:35.741 --> 39:39.008
Can you tell me where you think
this all came from?

39:39.010 --> 39:43.713
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, you know,
it stems from me being molested

39:43.715 --> 39:45.482
when I was
about eight years old.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.884
Hmm, how do you feel about that?

39:47.886 --> 39:49.719
I mean, I felt awful.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.155
When my parents came in,
they interrupted.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.691
They didn't even ask me
if I wanted to continue.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.960
I mean, they could've just...
When they came in,

39:56.962 --> 39:59.729
they could've been like,
"son, do you wanna continue?"

39:59.731 --> 40:01.931
Like, I have a choice
too in this matter, right?

40:03.634 --> 40:05.101
- Hmm.
- Right?

40:05.103 --> 40:06.770
Don't you think so?

40:09.073 --> 40:10.640
No?

40:10.642 --> 40:11.775
Hmm.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.880
So, it sounds like sex

40:16.882 --> 40:22.185
occupies a large portion of
your at least available time?

40:24.455 --> 40:27.657
And if you gave it up,
what else would you do?

40:27.659 --> 40:33.563
Um, I mean, I enjoy drawing,
I enjoy reading.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.798
Uh-huh.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.668
Um, badminton...
Definitely underrated.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.136
I don't know
if you've ever played.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.504
I have.

40:41.506 --> 40:45.041
It's a sweet deal.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.911
I feel like it's just
so hard for me to...

40:47.913 --> 40:50.680
To think of anything
outside of sex.

40:50.682 --> 40:54.617
You sound really torn
about this.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.120
Yeah, I mean,
it's tough when people,

40:57.122 --> 41:00.023
you know, at work,
wanna go out for drinks

41:00.025 --> 41:02.192
and you can't go out for drinks

41:02.194 --> 41:03.827
because you have to get home

41:03.829 --> 41:08.765
to get the demons
out of your penis, you know.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.568
- You have demons in your penis.
- Yeah.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.802
Ectoplasm.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.239
- Mmm.
- It serves as, so...

41:16.241 --> 41:19.709
In order for you to...

41:19.711 --> 41:22.745
Wrestle your way
through this issue

41:22.747 --> 41:24.781
you're gonna have
to face the demons,

41:24.783 --> 41:27.584
but not the demons
in your penis.

41:27.586 --> 41:29.986
The demons in your mind.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.822
Well, if I wrestle, I'll just get
more excited, that's the problem.

41:32.824 --> 41:37.227
Well, it's gonna be a big price
you're gonna have to pay.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.596
It's a whole different
way of living.

41:41.198 --> 41:43.933
The question is, are you
willing to pay that price?

41:43.935 --> 41:45.168
What do I have to give up?

41:45.170 --> 41:46.603
Well, you may not want to.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.505
Why give it up?

41:48.507 --> 41:51.207
If you're happy doing it,
keep doing it.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.711
I'm happy, but I also
acknowledge the fact

41:54.713 --> 41:56.145
that is ruining
my relationships,

41:56.147 --> 41:58.781
- my productivity at work.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

41:58.783 --> 42:01.117
- My career...
- Yeah.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.720
Um, the desensitizations.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.860
Rex, you have a decision
to make.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.930
There is no path that
you can take in life

42:13.932 --> 42:15.899
that doesn't have loss.

42:15.901 --> 42:21.037
You can have all the sex you
want, and no relationships,

42:21.039 --> 42:22.839
no relationship
with your family,

42:22.841 --> 42:26.276
no constructive
long-term relationship

42:26.278 --> 42:29.679
and a deteriorating work life.

42:29.681 --> 42:32.715
Or, you can have all
those other things

42:32.717 --> 42:36.219
but you're gonna have to give up
compulsive masturbation

42:36.221 --> 42:41.291
compulsive promiscuity
and salivating sex.

42:41.293 --> 42:43.226
I don't know if I can
do that, doctor.

42:43.228 --> 42:46.596
You are at a choice point.

42:49.099 --> 42:51.568
So I'd like to make
a recommendation,

42:51.570 --> 42:55.972
I think that with a case
of this extremity

42:55.974 --> 43:00.910
that you're probably gonna wanna
go into a program,

43:00.912 --> 43:04.280
something like sex and love
addicts anonymous or, uh...

43:04.282 --> 43:06.916
You can help me, right?

43:06.918 --> 43:09.018
- You know, this is...
- You can't help me?

43:09.020 --> 43:11.721
Nah, this is a particular
specialization

43:11.723 --> 43:14.257
and I really think you need
to be with somebody

43:14.259 --> 43:19.929
who is really well trained
in this area.

43:28.806 --> 43:30.173
Wanna talk about it?

43:30.175 --> 43:32.775
No, there's nothing
to talk about.

43:32.777 --> 43:35.778
There's a lot to talk about. I
mean, that was intense for you.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.948
You haven't said anything since we got
back. - There's nothing to talk about.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.817
Why do you wanna always talk
about everything?

43:40.819 --> 43:42.819
Because, Rex, that's how
people get through things.

43:42.821 --> 43:45.121
That's how you get
through things.

43:45.123 --> 43:47.991
- That's not how I get through things.
- Can we talk, please?

43:47.993 --> 43:49.926
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Yes, there is.

43:49.928 --> 43:52.295
There's plenty to talk about.
Put your phone away.

43:52.297 --> 43:55.999
- No, that will not happen.
- Rex, give me your damn phone.

43:56.001 --> 43:58.001
- Give me your phone.
- You need to back off of me.

43:58.003 --> 43:59.836
You need to talk to me
and be an adult.

43:59.838 --> 44:01.671
I have to go
get some relief now.

44:01.673 --> 44:03.840
You're not going anywhere, Rex.

44:03.842 --> 44:06.009
Rex, do not leave
this apartment.

44:06.011 --> 44:08.177
You cannot make me.
I'm an adult,

44:08.179 --> 44:11.314
and I will go do what I need to
do, which is get me some relief.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.449
You think I'm just gonna stand
here and let you leave?

44:13.451 --> 44:14.750
I have someone
to meet on tinder.

44:14.752 --> 44:17.153
I don't care who you're meeting.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.688
Come on, we're following him.

44:18.690 --> 44:20.056
Well, don't you think...

44:20.058 --> 44:21.824
No, we're not gonna
give him a minute.

44:21.826 --> 44:24.093
You can hear him?

44:24.095 --> 44:27.263
Yes, I can hear
everything he's saying.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.766
Oh, god, he's so vile.
He's back here.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.270
I... well, because...

44:34.272 --> 44:35.938
His lav's still connected.

44:35.940 --> 44:38.041
Rex left his apartment
in a huff a few hours ago

44:38.043 --> 44:39.208
and we've been tracking him

44:39.210 --> 44:41.077
because he left
his microphone on.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.348
- Oh, no.
- Where is he?

44:45.350 --> 44:48.418
Please tell me he's not
falling into his old habits.

44:48.420 --> 44:50.053
Yo, come in.

44:53.891 --> 44:59.028
Hey. Um, is Ashley here?

44:59.030 --> 45:02.832
- I'm Ashley, what's up?
- Ash is a woman.

45:02.834 --> 45:05.968
- That's all my photographs.
- You're not Ashley.

45:05.970 --> 45:08.404
- Is that a dude?
- I had a different wig on.

45:08.406 --> 45:14.343
Okay, on the tinder profile,
dude, it was a woman, okay?

45:14.345 --> 45:16.779
A sexy light-skinned
black woman.

45:16.781 --> 45:19.015
- Yeah, I'm light.
- But she was a woman.

45:19.017 --> 45:21.084
It appears as though Rex
has found himself

45:21.086 --> 45:24.287
- that's not you...
- In a room with a transvestite.

45:24.289 --> 45:27.356
You said, "people say
I look similar to Beyoncé."

45:27.358 --> 45:30.026
Yeah, in the shoulders.

45:30.028 --> 45:33.029
You don't look anything like...
You don't look like...

45:33.031 --> 45:36.399
You don't even look like
a shit that Beyoncé took.

45:36.401 --> 45:39.102
You're not as cute as you said
you were in your picture.

45:39.104 --> 45:41.170
Yeah, but it's fine
but I have my genitals

45:41.172 --> 45:43.306
that I claimed that I do
and you clearly do not.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.141
Did you get surgery,
do you have your vagina?

45:45.143 --> 45:46.843
Do you have a penis,
what do you have?

45:46.845 --> 45:49.912
I just have a penis. I am... I
did put a pussy on layaway.

45:49.914 --> 45:53.916
I didn't come down here
intending to be with a man.

45:53.918 --> 45:55.318
You're a man, dude.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.953
First time for everything, man.

45:56.955 --> 45:58.355
Oh god. I keep getting
crotch shots.

46:01.525 --> 46:04.393
You know... - -All right,
just give me a fucking moment.

46:06.797 --> 46:09.432
Hey, I got some ecstasy
in there. It's in the cabinet.

46:09.434 --> 46:11.834
Close your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

46:11.836 --> 46:13.069
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

46:17.407 --> 46:20.176
He's fucking...

46:20.178 --> 46:22.845
Oh no, he's going
through his list.

46:24.815 --> 46:25.982
Fuck.

46:25.984 --> 46:28.384
Fuck.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.319
Sandrine, pick up the phone.

46:30.321 --> 46:32.321
I need to see you right now.

46:32.323 --> 46:34.290
I don't care
if you're seeing him.

46:34.292 --> 46:37.026
No, you know, I can't pay
as much as him.

46:37.028 --> 46:38.928
Fuck, fuck!

46:38.930 --> 46:41.030
It's fucking over.

46:41.032 --> 46:42.532
Oh, man.

46:42.534 --> 46:44.500
Oh, god, I don't wanna have
sex with a tranny.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.172
No way he's gonna do it.

46:52.242 --> 46:53.342
It's...

46:54.945 --> 46:56.579
Unfortunately
it's like any addiction.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.481
When you hit bottom,
you hit bottom.

46:58.483 --> 47:01.350
Wassup? Mr. Rex, welcome back.

47:01.352 --> 47:06.255
- Get your mind right?
- Um... I'm... I'm trying.

47:06.257 --> 47:08.491
Let's just get this over with.

47:08.493 --> 47:11.027
- Just hurry the fuck up.
- Come relax here, man.

47:11.029 --> 47:12.495
To be fair, he shaved his legs.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.530
They've got a nice shape.

47:14.532 --> 47:17.033
- Give me, like, six or seven drinks.
- I got you.

47:17.035 --> 47:18.568
Don't... it's okay.

47:18.570 --> 47:20.503
I'm gonna have to touch you.
Take the shirt off.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.839
Okay, we're gonna have to...

47:22.841 --> 47:25.041
Just don't touch me,
please, right now.

47:27.545 --> 47:30.513
Yeah, whatever.
Put some pills in there too.

47:30.515 --> 47:31.948
I wanna go out
like Heath ledger.

47:31.950 --> 47:33.916
Get in here.
Turn that light off.

47:33.918 --> 47:35.318
Yeah, throw it in there.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.886
Oh, shit. My fucking mic is on.

47:36.888 --> 47:38.521
What do you think
a documentary is?

47:38.523 --> 47:40.356
We have to get everything.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.892
I got some codeine.

47:42.894 --> 47:45.895
Throw that in. That's fine.

47:45.897 --> 47:48.397
I called my boy,
I can get some Zoloft.

47:48.399 --> 47:52.368
Yeah, just...
Just throw it in there...

47:52.370 --> 47:53.636
Yeah, try that. Try that.

47:53.638 --> 47:58.407
Yeah, yeah, going down.
Hah, get it?

47:58.409 --> 48:00.243
- Yeah.
- All right. Close your eyes

48:00.245 --> 48:01.911
it... no, oh, my god.

48:01.913 --> 48:03.913
Oh god, no.

48:03.915 --> 48:05.581
- Oh, god, I can't.
- God, you are so...

48:05.583 --> 48:08.384
Hey, we can't leave.
When Rex walks out of there,

48:08.386 --> 48:10.253
he's gonna be going through
a lot of guilt

48:10.255 --> 48:12.555
and we need to make sure
that we're here for him.

48:12.557 --> 48:14.624
Oh, my god.

48:14.626 --> 48:16.125
Rex, Rex.

48:16.127 --> 48:18.227
Cigarette out on his nuts.

48:31.441 --> 48:32.575
Hey, suzanna.

48:35.379 --> 48:36.579
Uh, suzanna.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.347
Come on, time to wake up.

48:38.349 --> 48:39.916
I think he's been asleep
for a while.

48:39.918 --> 48:41.651
Rise and shine.

48:41.653 --> 48:43.185
Rise and shine, come on.

48:43.187 --> 48:45.521
Wake up. Wake up.

48:45.523 --> 48:49.091
Those sedatives must have been
extra strong.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.493
Come on.

48:52.095 --> 48:53.696
Oh, thank god,
it was just a bad dream.

48:53.698 --> 48:55.097
- Yeah.
- Are you sure about that?

48:57.634 --> 49:01.237
Well, I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, but...

49:01.239 --> 49:03.940
Look under your sheets.

49:06.510 --> 49:08.678
Why does my dick look
like don cheadle?

49:08.680 --> 49:12.949
Calm down, Rex. Rex, so sorry.
I need you to calm down.

49:12.951 --> 49:15.484
It's easy for you to say,
have you seen his nostrils?

49:15.486 --> 49:17.019
We brought you some flowers.

49:17.021 --> 49:19.388
And a card from the rest
of the team.

49:19.390 --> 49:22.591
With the...
Just the flowers and stuff.

49:22.593 --> 49:25.194
Oh, what's Diego doing here?
He's I.T.

49:25.196 --> 49:27.964
You're the one who made
the discovery.

49:27.966 --> 49:30.132
What... what discovery you guys
are talking about?

49:30.134 --> 49:33.636
Well, Rex, while you have been
gone, the servers went down,

49:33.638 --> 49:36.372
and me being
the I.T. Guy and all,

49:36.374 --> 49:38.307
I made a little investigation

49:38.309 --> 49:42.178
and I traced the cause
back to your computer.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.513
Oh, okay, so...

49:44.515 --> 49:46.215
Look, what he's trying to say is

49:46.217 --> 49:49.185
we found the hardcore
pornography on your hard drive.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.354
That's some really
disturbing shit, man.

49:51.356 --> 49:54.490
Stuff we didn't even
know existed.

49:54.492 --> 49:56.659
Speak for yourself.

49:56.661 --> 49:58.361
I can hear everything
you're saying.

49:58.363 --> 50:00.096
Rex, you're fired.
Just give him the papers.

50:00.098 --> 50:02.365
I'm fired? How am I
supposed to pay my bills?

50:02.367 --> 50:04.200
- He's in the hospital bed.
- My rent?

50:04.202 --> 50:06.202
Maybe you should've
thought of that before

50:06.204 --> 50:08.337
you downloaded "gangbang
bitches 8" on your computer.

50:08.339 --> 50:09.972
How about don't be
so sensitive, Dennis?

50:09.974 --> 50:11.473
Just 'cause your wife
got gangbanged

50:11.475 --> 50:12.841
by a bunch of fucking slovenians

50:12.843 --> 50:15.043
doesn't mean we all have to
walk on eggshells for you.

50:15.045 --> 50:17.146
- Why do you know that?
- They were czechoslovakian.

50:17.148 --> 50:19.248
- They were Czech.
- And you know what?

50:19.250 --> 50:21.450
I'm not gonna discuss that
here with you, now.

50:21.452 --> 50:23.452
Look, you're fired.
Just sign the goddamn papers.

50:23.454 --> 50:25.087
I'm not signing shit.

50:25.089 --> 50:27.723
That's just the folder.
Take that.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.058
Okay, I want
my severance package

50:29.060 --> 50:30.593
before I sign shit, Dennis.

50:30.595 --> 50:32.428
Brat, you're not getting
a severance package.

50:32.430 --> 50:33.896
- Fuck you, Dennis.
- Yeah, fuck you.

50:33.898 --> 50:35.898
- Fuck your wife, too.
- Yeah, everybody else did.

50:35.900 --> 50:38.267
Leave my fucking balloons.
And fuck you, Victoria.

50:38.269 --> 50:40.703
You're nothing but a paid snitch
sitting in human resources.

50:40.705 --> 50:42.405
That is true. I love my job.

50:42.407 --> 50:44.006
Eazy-e would've been
displeased of you.

50:44.008 --> 50:45.141
- Yeah.
- Can you take this?

50:45.143 --> 50:46.342
Out of my face, all of you.

50:46.344 --> 50:49.245
Great job and choice of porn.

50:49.247 --> 50:52.214
Why are you petting me?
Why is everyone touching me?

50:54.251 --> 50:56.252
Sorry. Sorry.

50:56.254 --> 50:58.721
Rex, I didn't mean it.
I watch porn, too.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.090
And I fucked his wife, too.
She's a whore.

51:01.092 --> 51:03.259
- I love you, man.
- I like you, Diego.

51:03.261 --> 51:05.628
I like your mustache.
You're good with me.

51:05.630 --> 51:07.696
- Thanks, man.
- Let's reach out on Facebook, okay?

51:07.698 --> 51:08.864
Yeah, I'll poke you on there.

51:08.866 --> 51:12.001
How... how does
your penis feel right now?

51:13.804 --> 51:15.771
I mean, I guess I don't
feel anything, doctor.

51:15.773 --> 51:18.240
- It's good.
- Mmm, you'd better get used to it.

51:18.242 --> 51:20.509
- Wait, what?
- What's that supposed to mean?

51:20.511 --> 51:24.180
Well, evidence suggests
that it isn't temporary,

51:24.182 --> 51:26.649
it's permanent.

51:26.651 --> 51:28.851
What? You mean I can never
feel my penis again?

51:28.853 --> 51:32.088
I'm afraid not. The burns, they
were just too significant.

51:32.090 --> 51:35.224
I mean, the whole outer
layer was gone.

51:35.226 --> 51:38.194
- It was gone before this.
- Oh.

51:39.596 --> 51:44.600
Well, you can have sex,
but not in the same way.

51:44.602 --> 51:46.335
What kind of sex
can I have, doctor?

51:46.337 --> 51:47.803
Please tell me I can have sex.

51:47.805 --> 51:50.206
Tell me I can have sex.
I wanna have sex again, doctor.

51:50.208 --> 51:51.674
You can have sex again.

51:51.676 --> 51:53.509
- I can?
- Sure.

51:53.511 --> 51:57.880
You can have all the oral sex,
you can perform all the oral sex

51:57.882 --> 52:02.685
you want with any woman
that you want or men.

52:02.687 --> 52:06.155
- Listen, I have to run now.
- Husbands do it all the time.

52:06.157 --> 52:09.225
Don't make that face.

52:09.227 --> 52:10.426
Ew, what is that?

52:10.428 --> 52:12.328
This could be a good thing.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.730
You know, like...

52:14.732 --> 52:16.565
You're, like, gonna be
the giver, you know.

52:16.567 --> 52:19.135
I don't wanna be the giver,
I wanna be the getter.

52:19.137 --> 52:22.204
You can't always get, Rex.

52:22.206 --> 52:25.141
Listen, I can, like,
try to verbalize it

52:25.143 --> 52:29.512
and tell you what would be
appropriate and it's really...

52:29.514 --> 52:32.548
Well, it's complicated,
there's a lot of moving parts.

52:34.318 --> 52:36.418
Listen, it's...

52:36.420 --> 52:38.287
Okay, what...

52:39.856 --> 52:42.491
No!

52:44.294 --> 52:45.794
What... doc...

52:45.796 --> 52:48.831
Doctor, this thing...
Unplugged and...

52:48.833 --> 52:50.166
I think it's important.

53:06.349 --> 53:08.517
Okay.

53:08.519 --> 53:11.220
I'm doing okay?
Let me grab your keys.

53:11.222 --> 53:12.354
What's this?

53:14.224 --> 53:15.424
What is that?

53:15.426 --> 53:16.692
It's an eviction notice.

53:16.694 --> 53:19.395
For what? Did you not
pay your rent?

53:19.397 --> 53:20.896
I was in the hospital
the whole time.

53:20.898 --> 53:22.598
I couldn't pay my rent.

53:22.600 --> 53:27.236
30 days of notice
to vacate the rental unit?

53:27.238 --> 53:29.872
What the hell?
I'm gonna be homeless.

53:29.874 --> 53:33.242
I'm gonna be homeless. This is the
American dream everyone's talking about?

53:33.244 --> 53:36.412
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I fell, okay, on hard times.

53:36.414 --> 53:38.680
I just need a little bit of time
to get back on my feet.

53:38.682 --> 53:39.748
They're kicking me out.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.650
Come on, we're gonna
figure this out.

53:41.652 --> 53:43.385
This is bullshit.

53:43.387 --> 53:44.420
Come on.

53:45.855 --> 53:46.956
Stupid notice.

54:01.871 --> 54:03.005
Okay.

54:04.374 --> 54:05.641
All right.

54:05.643 --> 54:06.809
You got it?

54:06.811 --> 54:08.844
Come on.

54:08.846 --> 54:11.513
- There you go.
- I have to learn to be independent

54:11.515 --> 54:13.549
and work my arm muscles.

54:13.551 --> 54:14.683
All right.

54:16.553 --> 54:19.388
- What's this?
- What's what?

54:19.390 --> 54:21.290
You're into tentacle sex, too?

54:21.292 --> 54:24.326
That's not a thing.
It is a thing.

54:24.328 --> 54:25.994
You spent time in the orient,
didn't you?

54:25.996 --> 54:28.030
It was in Asia, and I did.

54:28.032 --> 54:29.498
See, that's how
you learned about it.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.700
See? You got the hat too.

54:31.702 --> 54:34.336
Wait, I need to wear the hat.

54:34.338 --> 54:36.305
- If I give you the hat...
- Give me the hat!

54:36.307 --> 54:39.308
- I need the hat. Hat, me!
- Don't speak to me like that.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.644
Me, hat!

54:41.646 --> 54:42.778
- Okay.
- Thank you.

54:44.781 --> 54:46.315
Please be careful with that.

54:46.317 --> 54:48.384
You got a little lord Raiden
up in here, huh?

54:48.386 --> 54:50.026
- I don't know who that is.
- Thunder god.

54:51.721 --> 54:53.989
Sure. Um, I'm gonna use
the bathroom.

54:53.991 --> 54:56.825
- You okay? You want me to take these?
- Yes.

54:56.827 --> 54:59.028
Thank you. You hear me?

54:59.030 --> 55:01.463
Thank you.

55:01.465 --> 55:02.825
Can you keep an eye on him,
please?

55:03.900 --> 55:06.835
- Okay. Unpack.
- Yeah.

55:06.837 --> 55:08.804
- I'm gonna go 'cause I wanna go.
- Yeah.

55:10.740 --> 55:13.742
We don't take too kindly
to your kind around here.

55:13.744 --> 55:15.010
Get.

55:53.550 --> 55:55.751
Remind me I need to buy
toilet paper later.

55:55.753 --> 55:58.020
What are you doing?
Why are you throwing stuff?

55:58.022 --> 56:01.123
Suzanna, how's it been
since Rex moved in?

56:01.125 --> 56:03.992
It's been good, surprisingly.

56:03.994 --> 56:06.762
Um, he's had a much more
positive outlook.

56:09.733 --> 56:12.701
He's been really
settling in nicely,

56:12.703 --> 56:15.404
I think he's really trying
to open up his mind

56:15.406 --> 56:17.573
and really accept and allow

56:17.575 --> 56:20.042
as opposed to just seeing
things his way.

56:20.044 --> 56:21.510
- Just gonna...
- What are you doing?

56:21.512 --> 56:22.878
You don't need these reminders.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.747
They're adding character
to the apartment.

56:24.749 --> 56:26.682
- You're torturing yourself.
- They smell nice.

56:26.684 --> 56:29.017
- No.
- What the hell?

56:29.019 --> 56:32.087
Just his outlook on life,
positivity,

56:32.089 --> 56:34.757
really focusing on, you know,

56:34.759 --> 56:36.759
the inside,
not as much as the exterior.

56:36.761 --> 56:37.926
For so long he was...

56:37.928 --> 56:41.764
Just so focused on his libido.

56:41.766 --> 56:45.401
- What are you doing?
- Homework.

56:46.603 --> 56:48.070
What kind?

56:48.072 --> 56:49.872
The kind that's due tomorrow.

56:55.578 --> 56:58.080
- What are you doing?
- Right there.

56:58.082 --> 57:01.784
- Put that down.
- Open. "Ah." Say "ah!"

57:01.786 --> 57:03.452
Rex, I'm trying...
I'm not saying "ah."

57:03.454 --> 57:05.087
I'm not at the dentist.
Put that down.

57:05.089 --> 57:07.923
- "Ah."
- Stop it. Stop it.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.792
Okay, that's enough of that.

57:09.794 --> 57:12.795
- "Ah." Where are you going?
- Gosh, stop.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.062
Away.

57:16.466 --> 57:18.066
Why?

57:18.068 --> 57:21.937
You know, I'm really excited
about what we're doing.

57:21.939 --> 57:24.807
I think that people
are really gonna see

57:24.809 --> 57:28.744
another side to sex addiction
that they don't see.

57:28.746 --> 57:31.480
We're covering ground that
has not been covered before.

57:31.482 --> 57:34.650
We're Louis and clarking
sex addiction

57:34.652 --> 57:36.652
I'm really, really excited.

57:36.654 --> 57:40.489
Dude, I will shove my fist
through your asshole.

57:40.491 --> 57:42.658
It'll come out of your mouth,

57:42.660 --> 57:47.563
then I'll stick my arm over
a hot flame and slow-roast you

57:47.565 --> 57:50.699
before feeding you
to your own fucking children.

57:50.701 --> 57:52.601
Learn how to fucking
play the game!

57:53.636 --> 57:54.636
God.

58:00.210 --> 58:01.543
Hold on.

58:13.790 --> 58:16.158
Rex, I wanna hear
your breath of fire.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.727
Oh, you're hearing
my breath, all right.

58:19.796 --> 58:21.563
Okay. Ready?

58:24.701 --> 58:27.536
People who are in wheelchairs
can't play soccer.

58:28.872 --> 58:30.873
You insensitive bitch.

58:33.243 --> 58:34.576
Rex!

58:46.089 --> 58:47.956
Keep going, all right?

58:47.958 --> 58:49.091
You're doing real good.

58:51.160 --> 58:52.294
Good.

58:53.863 --> 58:54.997
Real good.

58:58.067 --> 58:59.835
Wake up.

58:59.837 --> 59:01.169
Wake up.

59:04.073 --> 59:05.841
I got nothing.

59:05.843 --> 59:06.975
Done.

59:09.112 --> 59:10.245
Rex, where are you going?

59:11.548 --> 59:16.118
Hey!

59:16.120 --> 59:18.720
Pick up your fucking phone.

59:18.722 --> 59:19.855
Sorry.

59:20.990 --> 59:22.124
Hello?

59:24.260 --> 59:26.728
Really?

59:26.730 --> 59:29.264
You think that you might
be able to... cure him?

59:32.235 --> 59:35.704
I mean, I don't know...
He's not around right now.

59:35.706 --> 59:37.072
Get out of here.

59:37.074 --> 59:40.242
Um, I can try to talk
to him and see

59:40.244 --> 59:42.678
if these are even options
that he wants to consider.

59:53.089 --> 59:55.791
The nerve endings
in my cock are gone.

59:55.793 --> 59:57.793
The nerve endings
in my cock are gone!

59:59.862 --> 01:00:02.731
Rex! Oh, my god, Rex, come on.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:05.900
Let me die. Let me die. - Get over here.
No, this is ridiculous, get up here.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:08.069
- Rex, get up here.
- Let go. It doesn't work anymore.

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.972
- My legs.
- Give me your hand.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:11.640
- Let me die.
- Rex.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:13.241
- I don't deserve dignity.
- Look at me.

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:14.376
Oh, my god. Look at me.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.350
Roll over. Jesus.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:28.256
God, Jack, you're so brave.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:34.663
You're stupid, rose.
You're stupid.

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:37.666
Why did you do it, rose?
You don't think.

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:40.402
You don't think 'cause you're
a stupid bitch, rose.

01:00:40.404 --> 01:00:42.137
Are you okay, Rex?

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.075
Are you crying?

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:50.779
Ah!

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.916
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey.

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:57.085
Nothing. Making dinner.

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:03.191
Stop it. I'm trying to cook.
Get out of here.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:06.294
- What are you making?
- I'm making a tortilla soup.

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:10.966
My mom used to make it all the time. It's really good.
- Yum.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:12.000
That's good.

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:18.907
- Can you throw them in there please?
- Sure.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:19.909
Thank you.

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.946
All right.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:32.187
- Good?
- Hello?

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:35.991
Yeah. Hi, doctor, yeah.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:39.294
Okay... yo, Rex,
it's the doctor.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.196
The doctor is on
the phone for you.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.065
You need to tell him just
to call back later.

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:47.202
We're gonna do dinner now.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.071
I'll be a minute.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:51.073
- Hello?
- Maybe it's something important.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.340
Yeah, something important.

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:53.742
Surprised to hear from you.

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:56.712
- Smells good.
- Yeah.

01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:58.213
So, what's up?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:01.083
- Interesting.
- You're what?

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.818
- I don't know what they're talking about.
- What's wrong with you?

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.087
- You can't give him the phone.
- Why can't I give him...

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:08.055
Because he can't talk
to the doctor right now.

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.791
- Why not?
- Because...

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.193
What's going on?

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:15.197
He said there might be
a way to fix it.

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:19.034
But I don't think he should
take that chance right now.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:21.536
- But I mean, that's good news, isn't it?
- It's not good news.

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:23.105
It's experimental
and it's a bad idea.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.774
He's not in the mindset to do
anything like this right now.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:28.443
I don't know, I think this
is something that he wants.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:31.413
No, I don't... maybe
it's something he wants,

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:34.116
but it's not something
that he should get right now.

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:36.785
He is fragile. He is teetering.

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.987
I mean, I guess, but...

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:42.124
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, Rex?

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:45.227
The doctor has been trying
to leave messages for me.

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:47.762
And I've been wanting to talk to
you about it, but I thought...

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.130
You've been deleting
my voicemails?

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.832
- I think that maybe...
- Seriously?

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:52.367
- Rex... please...
- Suzanna.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:53.802
Fuck.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:55.303
You make bad decisions
when you think.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:56.772
And you're mean when you're mad.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.707
You know why?
Because you're keeping

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:01.042
medical information
away from me.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.145
My cock, the most important
thing in my life,

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:04.913
and you're keeping
information away from me.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:06.148
And you're being ridiculous.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.916
The doctor has been
trying to get to me.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:09.751
- I don't give a fuck...
- That's malpractice.

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:11.820
It's not malpractice.
No, it's not.

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:13.455
You're being a child right now.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.990
I'm trying to do
what's best for you

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:16.992
and you're not
even paying attention.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:19.294
All these books, suzanna.
All these books and for what?

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:20.562
- And for what?
- To read, Rex.

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:22.464
Does this make you smart?

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.366
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Does this make you smart?

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.168
Does it make you fucking smart?

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:27.836
- Stop!
- No, you're just stupid.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.838
- Oh, really?
- You're stupid just like rose.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.373
- What? Who is rose?
- You're stupid.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.175
You have red hair just like her.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.510
Are you serious? We're gonna
reference "Titanic" right now?

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.013
Screw you. My doctor's trying
to get in touch with me

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:40.148
and you fucking delete
my voicemail?

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:43.018
- And this is how you react.
- Absolutely! It's my cock.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.853
Thank you for proving my point.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:46.588
You can't handle
this information right now.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.490
What are you doing? Stop it.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:50.325
What the fuck are you doing
out of the chair?

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:54.029
Dude, get out of my fucking
face with that camera.

01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:56.498
- Seriously, dude.
- You can't walk right now.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.034
What are you do...
Rex, listen to me.

01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:00.335
Stop walking away from me.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:03.505
My cock burned,
not my legs, idiot.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:06.208
- I'm not an idiot.
- Okay?

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.543
Well, then you're an idiot
for not figuring it out by now

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.879
there could've been something
they could've done.

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:13.948
Yeah, 'cause somebody was going through
my phone and deleting my voicemails.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.017
Because you're not an adult
and you can't handle it.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.220
Don't put your hand on
my face like that. Really?

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:20.422
God, you're such
a fucking child.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:21.489
Fuck.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.128
Get the fucking
camera away from me.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:31.233
I think that I was an idiot.

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:34.069
And I...

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:36.037
I shouldn't have lied
to him and...

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.942
I just...

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:43.178
I didn't think that
he would change and he did

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.981
and I...

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.085
The integrity of the research
has been compromised,

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.523
and we can no longer move
forward with the dissertation.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:06.301
Do you miss him?

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:12.040
I want... I wanna say
I don't miss him.

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.345
But I do.

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:13.668
Hi, friends.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:15.603
You may remember me.
I'm Theodore.

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:17.439
Remember me
from the coffee shop?

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.407
That's right, I think you do.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:23.611
Yep, just got done spending
a long part of my life

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:26.014
wasting it away on that guy Rex.

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:28.350
Yeah, four months
I served as an intern

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:31.286
for that fucking choad.
But it's okay.

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:33.722
'Cause when I saw suzanna
filming him for the first time,

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:37.325
I thought...
"What an opportunity."

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.327
This is my moment.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.563
"I'm gonna be okay."

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:45.166
She was doing what I've been
wanting to do my entire life.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.035
Do documentaries.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:50.171
And we found
the perfect subject.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.706
You, Rex.

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:54.009
You screwed me over big time.

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:55.643
It's not gonna happen anymore.

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:58.613
'Cause I'm coming after you.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:01.016
With footage of you, of course.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:03.752
And it's gonna be good
'cause I'm gonna use you

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:06.588
to ruin you,

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:07.590
on you.

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.626
It's probably gonna be
one of the worst things

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:13.294
you've ever gone through.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:18.733
You made me suffer
for a really long time.

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:20.735
It's implanted in my head.

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:22.470
It's because I had
to watch hours

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:25.073
of you fucking
over and over again,

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:27.475
and sometimes
in your p.O.V. Shots,

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:30.345
you didn't even
have a chick there.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:32.147
You just held the camera,

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:34.449
staring down for hours.

01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:37.786
And it was all brown
like the Sahara desert,

01:07:37.788 --> 01:07:39.687
and it went on for miles,

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:42.123
and I can't get it out.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:45.093
I had to look at your dick
time and time again,

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:47.128
but no more.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:50.698
If any dicks are coming out,
it's gonna be mine.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.535
You're gonna get fucked
hard, Rex.

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:56.538
So, enjoy the time
you have left,

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.641
because you're gonna pay up.
You're gonna pay up big.

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:01.443
That fucking airplane.

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:05.113
But it's okay.
So I'm coming for you, Rex.

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.876
She thinks she can just
give up on me?

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.545
Mm-hmm, that's not how we play
this filmmaking game.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:40.215
I've got to be the best film
documentarian

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.749
on the planet earth.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.718
But what do I do about motives?

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.453
What kind of motives?

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.221
I don't know.
I'll think of something.

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:48.490
Su... suzanna.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:49.724
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:52.327
- Fine.
- What happened?

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:55.330
- What are you talking about?
- With the dissertation.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.799
We're not doing
the dissertation anymore.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:00.835
- Why not?
- Because... it got compromised.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.837
Is it... is it a money issue?

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.238
- No.
- Tuition?

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:06.140
I'll pay.

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:08.209
You don't have any money,
Theodore.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.179
How much time do you have left?

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.814
I don't know.
A month and a half?

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.816
We have time. Let's you and me...

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:17.452
Let's team up
and let's finish this.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:20.255
What are we gonna do it on?

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.723
Documentary on you.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.840
We're not gonna talk about this.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.801
It's so fancy, it's in a box.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.711
The logistics...

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.881
Who was using it in store?

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.620
Jesus.

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:16.411
Ow! Seriously? Why?

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:18.246
Literally head to head.

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.417
Ooh!

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:24.252
You stay out there.

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.728
How do men out there

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.631
get their women
to have anal sex with them?

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:39.434
I don't know 'cause
men have not been successful

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:41.336
- in convincing me to do it.
- Really?

01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:43.370
Yeah, I'm not really into
putting things in my butt

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.273
other than like a colonic tube.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.909
Because on porn sets
when the girls to do anal,

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:50.278
a lot of times the girls don't
eat for, like, 24 hours,

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.980
- sure.
- They use an enema,

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:54.616
and then they do it.
In real life, most likely,

01:10:54.618 --> 01:10:56.284
if you guys just choose to do it

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:57.919
the woman might've
ate some food,

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.887
and next think you know
she's gonna poop on you.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:01.456
That's why I date bulimics.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:03.424
Oh, that's a good idea.
That works.

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.779
Hey, sister?

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:27.348
I really like your anal beads.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.516
Excuse me.

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:29.817
Yeah, how many can you fit it?

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.823
That's...

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.692
Is everyone else seeing
this shit?

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.666
Hey, ladies, how're you doing?

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:46.701
- Good, how are you?
- Just praising Jesus.

01:11:46.703 --> 01:11:48.803
- Oh.
- You know, that's what I do.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.406
- You guys love Jesus too?
- We do.

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:54.409
That's amazing. I was just looking at
his work in here and this is like,

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:56.878
"wow, this guy's done
some amazing work!"

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.680
- It's very deep.
- It is, very deep.

01:11:58.682 --> 01:12:01.716
- He's our savior.
- I like Isaiah, 37:20.

01:12:01.718 --> 01:12:05.920
- Yeah, um...
- Did you grow the beard to look like him?

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:07.522
I... exactly.

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:09.457
Exactly... do you like my beard?

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:10.792
I do, it's a good look.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:13.695
Look, I think we should
go back to my place

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:15.363
and we should praise
Jesus together

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:17.365
and drink some wine.

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:19.000
Jesus turned
water to wine, so...

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.835
We can praise him here.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.071
Yeah, but we don't have wine
here, unfortunately.

01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:25.807
You know, they don't have
the license for it in here.

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.942
What do you guys think?
Do you wanna get some wine

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:30.945
and, you know,
sing some hymns together?

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:33.881
- Okay. We love to sing.
- Yeah? You're down for it?

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:38.419
- Amazing. Awesome. I'm not far from here.
- Okay, good.

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:40.822
What a beautiful home!

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:43.024
I am really blown
away right now.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:45.493
Can't believe he scored this.

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:48.763
Ah, looks like
he has some company.

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:51.366
- Rex!
- Hey, what's up, man? How are ya?

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:55.636
I'm good. - Girls, yeah. Yeah, here,
girls, you wanna keep yourselves busy?

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:58.406
I like the shovel to the back
of the head really.

01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:00.207
- It's kinda my thing.
- Yeah, it is a style.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.543
Not funny, just real.
Hey, man, how's it going?

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:04.879
- It's going good.
- Good, good, good, good.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:08.750
What's happening? - You know, the
usual. Just getting some footage.

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:11.719
- How do you like my house?
- I think it is beautiful. Good for you.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.921
I appreciate that.
I worked hard for it.

01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:15.990
Six bedrooms. I bet you have
the biggest one, right?

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.859
Yeah, man. Take a look
at the garage, dude.

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.527
And the coolest.

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:22.163
Hold on. Wait, you're living
in the garage?

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:23.965
Yeah. Yeah, what's wrong
with that?

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:25.700
Oh, you know
I'm into the weird shit,

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:27.435
the freaky shit.
We got... we got...

01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.604
We got job ads, you know
I gotta be looking for a job,

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.606
we got coupons right there,
so...

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.808
We got some... some... some
gasoline right there,

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.777
you know, we got a shovel.

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:36.978
We got... everything's...

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.046
That we need for
a good sexual time,

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:41.482
that's great, man, that's great.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:43.884
You're gonna stick around for a couple of minutes?
- Maybe.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.421
I'll be quick, I'm not gonna
wear a condom this time.

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:47.922
So let me do my thing with them,

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:49.791
'cause this needs
to be fed right here,

01:13:49.793 --> 01:13:52.794
and I'll check you
in a couple of minutes.

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:55.763
Let me do my thing.
You stay back over there.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.131
Okay.

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:58.933
- All right, man, good luck!
- Yeah, thanks.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.635
Wishing you the best.

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:03.838
Rex keeps telling me to eat this
pineapple but I'm not...

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.120
Oh, wait, we're live.
We're live.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.945
- Uh-oh.
- We just did all that.

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.480
You're gonna leave me right now?

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:14.348
- He did something wrong.
- We cuddle at least?

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:16.484
- Come on.
- Get a life.

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:18.219
Come on, let's watch some
"O'Reilly factor."

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:19.887
What?

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:21.122
What's that?

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.523
It's a news program.

01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:29.130
- What?
- And they're leaving.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:30.932
Can I... can I...
Let me get in here.

01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:32.200
- Memories.
- Great footage.

01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:36.103
- Hashtag loser.
- Yep, he is a loser.

01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:37.538
That's perfect.

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:40.708
Hashtag loser?

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.615
Whatever, man.

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:48.617
I don't feel good.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:54.755
Rex?

01:14:56.625 --> 01:15:00.161
Okay, so here we are at
suzanna's apartment.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.996
Trying to finish
her dissertation.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.998
She actually thinks
I'm gonna try and help her.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.834
But it's not gonna happen.
Do I have time?

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:08.936
No. I do,
but I'm not gonna do it,

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:10.905
I have my own intentions.

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:23.184
I don't got time for this.

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:27.955
Suzanna?

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:32.560
Is she home?

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.161
What's going on?

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:39.133
Suzanna?

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:41.536
Oh, what is this?

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:44.672
What is this?

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:49.677
Is that a horse?

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:50.679
What the hell?

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:56.284
What is she...?

01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:58.553
Oh.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:00.721
Wait a minute.
What's going on down there?

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:02.590
That feels funny.

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:07.028
What is happening?
What is she doing?

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:11.933
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:17.638
The problem is he's ambivalent
about changing. - -Right.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.307
Yeah, he's not
a bit fan of change.

01:16:19.309 --> 01:16:22.977
Right. And so, um...

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:26.847
It's gonna be very tough
and I think community support

01:16:26.849 --> 01:16:29.717
and a specialist working
with him...

01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:33.154
- can maybe overcome his resistance.
- -Okay.

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:36.791
Okay, so I don't really agree
with my choice to come down here

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:38.926
and actually try
and help Rex out.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:43.230
But I hear he's in trouble.
I don't know if he's okay.

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:46.934
I guess I kinda care. I don't
really care but I kinda care,

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:51.138
so, we'll just see what
we come... up with.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.274
What in the world is he doing?

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.313
Rex?

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.315
Where are your clothes?

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:03.651
They're suffocating me.

01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:05.152
I'm suffocating.

01:17:05.154 --> 01:17:07.221
I feel like a gazelle, though.

01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:09.957
Feel like a gazelle,
feel like a gazelle.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.359
Look at these strides.

01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:13.694
Are you all right?

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:20.701
The world, man. Where's suzanna?

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:22.903
I... -i don't want the
rest of the girls.

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:24.005
I don't want them.

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:28.042
Get in the car.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:30.778
Rex, you need to get in the car.

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:34.315
Watch out, watch out.

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:40.821
What happened?

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.156
Oh, dear.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.262
Ah. You... you... fucking bitch.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.397
What?

01:17:49.399 --> 01:17:50.431
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:52.066
Control yourself.

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:54.268
Something seems different
about you today, though.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:55.770
- Yeah.
- Is it your hair?

01:17:55.772 --> 01:17:57.438
- No.
- No?

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.873
No, Rex.

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:00.875
You got that Rihanna
thing going.

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:05.046
- Rex.
- What?

01:18:05.048 --> 01:18:06.881
Rex, I'm in a fucking
motorized wheelchair.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:09.116
That's it! That's right.

01:18:09.118 --> 01:18:11.252
You ran over my foot.
I don't wanna pick that up.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.190
Don't you wanna know
what happened?

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.192
Yeah, what happened?

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.462
I was in the heat of
the moment with a client.

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:25.032
Things got romantic. You know how they do.
Can I touch myself?

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:29.737
- Stop touching yourself. I'm serious!
- All right, fine.

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:32.907
We were doing a standing 69
against the wall

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:35.876
and he climaxed.

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:39.880
My client climaxed and
I got dropped on my neck.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.049
- Ah!
- Yeah.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.285
I mean, he gave me a nice bonus
for it but, you know,

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:45.886
here I am, I'm paralyzed.

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.988
- You're paralyzed.
- Obviously.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.990
My god.

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:55.096
I need to... I need to sit.

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:56.098
Rex.

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:07.308
I can't keep carrying on the way
I'm carrying on, Theodore.

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:13.748
If this happened to you,
this could happen to me.

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:17.384
I have to change my ways.

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:20.321
I have to look at
the man in the mirror.

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:27.928
We've gotta go, Theodore.
We've gotta stop this madness.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.964
We've got to stop the madness.

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:31.766
What madness?

01:19:31.768 --> 01:19:33.901
- This.
- Rex, I'm worried about you.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.103
I'm worried about you.
You're the one that can't walk.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:37.404
Don't worry about me.

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:39.540
Oh, yeah, run away
like you always do.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:46.247
Ah!

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:52.853
I'm stuck.

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:56.157
I'm pretty sure this is illegal,

01:19:56.159 --> 01:20:00.494
but Rex doesn't seem to care.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:02.563
Like, ugh!

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:11.806
Theodore, just stay in the
corner and stay quiet, okay?

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:13.574
We don't want to offend
these people.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:15.142
Go over there.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:19.079
Hey, is this sexaholics
anonymous, guys, anyone?

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:21.248
Hey.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:24.251
Sexaholics anonymous, anyone?
I'm gonna to rape you all.

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:28.389
I'm so sorry I'm late, guys,
I was watching beheading videos

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:30.825
from the latest terrorist cell
in the middle east.

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:32.159
You know what they say.

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:35.930
Mo-hammed, mo-problems, right?

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:40.167
We have a new addition
to the group today.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.602
Your name, newbie?

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:44.471
- Rex. You can call me Rex.
- Have a seat, Rex.

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:47.141
Thanks, it's what Rosa parks
probably would've wanted, right?

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:51.512
Okay, let's start.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:54.148
Who wants to share? Tinya?

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:59.386
Hi, I'm tinya and I am really
into ass play.

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:02.022
Fuck, I just love sticking
shit up my ass.

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:03.224
Well, my name is Scott

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:07.261
and I guess my addiction
is masturbation.

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:10.130
My name is James
and I'm a sexter.

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:11.966
Your days are going to shit.

01:21:11.968 --> 01:21:14.969
You just need a good fist up
your fart hole to keep going.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:18.272
I remember having this really
bad addiction to sand paper.

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:19.874
I couldn't masturbate
without sand paper.

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:21.942
I pretended that I was a girl
a lot of times,

01:21:21.944 --> 01:21:25.479
lesbian, you know, really
got into that sort of thing.

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:27.548
My mom wore my anal beads
around her neck.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.417
And, you know, I still haven't
told her that that happened.

01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:32.353
And of course,
I finished off myself

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:36.523
because I can't come
unless I masturbate.

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:39.526
Maybe if they had sex emojis,
you know, blojies or something.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:41.228
Fuck, that would be
fucking cool.

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:47.968
Rex, Rex, Rex, Rex.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:51.572
Rex, Rex, Rex, Rex, Rex.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:54.942
- You don't trust this yet.
- No, not at all.

01:21:54.944 --> 01:21:59.113
I'm sorry. I know it's hard
when you wanna change,

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:02.616
you really do, but something's
keeping your guard up

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:06.453
and you can't allow
the love and acceptance in.

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:08.655
- Would it help if I shared my story?
- Not at all, no.

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:11.292
- I was 26, and...
- Please, don't...

01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:14.395
A student, young, idealistic,
protesting the war.

01:22:14.397 --> 01:22:16.230
It was just an abstraction

01:22:16.232 --> 01:22:19.433
until the unspeakable horrors
of the men and women

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:24.571
returning with missing arms,
legs and even feet.

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:27.207
I don't know, I guess
I just developed

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:31.478
an affinity for amputees...
And arousal.

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.348
This is getting weird.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:35.516
I'll be honest with you.

01:22:35.518 --> 01:22:37.718
Don't judge me.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.387
- I'm not judging you.
- We were in the circle of trust.

01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:43.324
I'm not in the circle of trust,
I just got here, okay?

01:22:43.326 --> 01:22:44.558
I'm sorry.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.529
My point is, every day
is a challenge.

01:22:48.531 --> 01:22:50.531
Okay, I'm not gonna
lie to you and say

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:52.499
that I'm cured
of my addictions, I'm not.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:58.172
Just last week, I hooked up with
this delicious little filly

01:22:58.174 --> 01:23:01.008
and I had her in a.

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:03.110
And she was doing something
magical to me

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:06.280
because I lost all control
of my muscles

01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:07.848
and I dropped that poor
girl on her head

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:09.316
and I guess now she can't move,

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.552
or walk or something like that
for the rest of her life.

01:23:11.554 --> 01:23:13.187
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:14.521
Wait.

01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:16.590
Was her name Trudy?

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:18.625
Yeah. How do you know?

01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:20.260
- That's my friend, dude.
- Oh!

01:23:20.262 --> 01:23:22.229
You paralyzed my fucking friend.

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:24.498
Ah, you associate
with a cripple?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.502
She wasn't a cripple before
you paralyzed her, you asshole.

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:31.505
- You watch your tone with me.
- I'm not watching shit.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:33.374
You watch your tone
with me, mister.

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:36.744
You watch your tone with me.
You watch your tone with me.

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:39.413
Don't let go. I'm gonna come.

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:44.118
Rex! Are you okay?

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.720
Oh, there's wetness in my pants.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:50.024
Ah, how'd you find me?

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:51.625
That's the man who paralyzed me.

01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:54.094
- What?
- What are you gonna do about it?

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:55.195
You can't even walk!

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.732
Oh, my god.

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:01.035
You all are so dysfunctional.

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:03.804
This is gonna be great
footage for my film.

01:24:03.806 --> 01:24:07.174
Your film? You're supposed to be
helping me with my dissertation.

01:24:07.176 --> 01:24:08.509
Yeah? So?

01:24:08.511 --> 01:24:10.644
Wait, you lied to her?

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:14.281
Yeah, I did and
I lied to you too, Rex.

01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:16.183
I thought we had something
great going.

01:24:16.185 --> 01:24:18.652
- What are you talking about, man?
- We have nothing great.

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.421
How many women
have you slept with?

01:24:20.423 --> 01:24:22.089
How man orifices
have you gone into?

01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:23.724
That's not important.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:25.826
Theodore, I don't know
the number to that, okay?

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:28.762
What I know is that I'm here,
I'm trying to fix myself.

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:30.364
Now it's my moment.

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:34.601
- My revenge, my time.
- Where's Jerome?

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:35.836
- Oh, hell no.
- Go after him.

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:42.276
- Eat my dust, suckers!
- We're never gonna catch up.

01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:43.410
Not through yet.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:46.280
What are you gonna do with that?

01:24:46.282 --> 01:24:48.582
The only thing I can do.
Throw it.

01:24:55.457 --> 01:25:00.127
Man, that really
knocked him out.

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:01.762
The black ones always do.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.597
Where'd you even get this thing?

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:06.200
I've been doing some exploring
of myself lately.

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:08.569
What?

01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:10.304
Good for you, girl.

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:13.307
That makes us even, Theodore,
you know that, right?

01:25:13.309 --> 01:25:15.776
- I guess that's fine.
- Not me.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.345
I never signed a release
for you to use my image.

01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:20.347
You can't use me in your film.

01:25:20.349 --> 01:25:21.682
What do you want?

01:25:21.684 --> 01:25:24.184
I still have a dissertation
to complete.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.722
Despite his many downfalls,

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:32.292
the subject has a remarkable
ability, much to my surprise,

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:34.294
to remain resilient.

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:37.598
And although he stays guarded,
his pursuit of the truth

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.834
allows him to confront his past.

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:43.770
His name is Rex
and he's a sex addict.

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:05.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:05.794 --> 01:26:07.761
- How'd it go?
- Good.

01:26:07.763 --> 01:26:10.931
- Yeah?
- Really good. They really liked it.

01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:15.269
That's great news.
- Yeah, I got Theodore to let me use his footage.

01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:17.604
That's... you know, we really
pushed him to do that.

01:26:17.606 --> 01:26:19.806
- And I'm really glad that we did.
- Yeah, me too.

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.316
Um...

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:31.919
- Can you shut the door?
- Sure. I'm okay with that.

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:35.289
Okay, open your mouth.

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:39.326
Wider.

01:26:39.328 --> 01:26:42.396
- Oh, god.
- Oh, god! I think I shouldn't do that.

01:26:42.398 --> 01:26:43.630
It was weird, right?

01:26:43.632 --> 01:26:45.966
Of course I got ahead of myself.

01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:48.302
I'm not meant for this stuff.

01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:51.205
I tried to... I'm talking too much.
I'm sorry.

01:26:51.207 --> 01:26:55.209
- No, I like the cut of your jib.
- Yeah?

01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:58.245
Yeah, no, it really did it for me.
I like it.

01:26:58.247 --> 01:27:00.614
- Okay.
- I like what you're doing.

01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:02.782
- Baby steps.
- We're gonna make something out of this.

01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:04.318
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.940
We're gonna make something
out of this.

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.394
Hi, where do I sit?

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:18.665
I'll show you.

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:32.679
I love you.

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.964
Where is she?

01:27:50.966 --> 01:27:52.599
Jesus Christ.

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.869
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.704
- Dressed for the occasion, I see.
- Shut up.

01:27:57.706 --> 01:27:58.905
How was graduation?

01:27:58.907 --> 01:28:00.340
Whew. Overrated.

01:28:00.342 --> 01:28:02.042
Not to mention
the student loans.

01:28:02.044 --> 01:28:04.611
Hey, listen, we need
to talk about last night.

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:06.446
What about last night?

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:09.349
Rex, you can't have sex
with me when I'm sleeping.

01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:11.685
So it's my fault
you wanna be lazy.

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:14.021
I have to have sex.

01:28:14.023 --> 01:28:16.690
It's not my fault you wanna
be lazy and go to sleep.

01:28:16.692 --> 01:28:17.991
I'm not lazy.

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:25.365
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here

01:28:25.367 --> 01:28:27.534
in this sight of god
and in the face of this company

01:28:27.536 --> 01:28:32.039
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony.

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:35.809
Wait. Padre, I'm sorry.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.377
I've something I gotta say.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:46.853
Trudy, when I first laid
eyes on you,

01:28:46.855 --> 01:28:49.022
I knew I had to have
sex with you.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:57.531
But more than that, I needed to
discover you, find out who you are,

01:28:57.533 --> 01:28:59.800
understand why you love
Tyler Perry movies.

01:28:59.802 --> 01:29:03.837
But more importantly,
I needed to find out

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:05.539
why you haven't had sex yet

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:09.109
with that handsome devil
friend of yours, Rex.

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:12.546
You see, me and him,
we had a little chat.

01:29:12.548 --> 01:29:15.382
He made me realize how
important you are to me.

01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:18.985
Hey, man, you're gonna get
pink eye like that.

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:20.721
What?

01:29:20.723 --> 01:29:23.390
Going from your nose
to your eye, man.

01:29:23.392 --> 01:29:26.059
Your whole operation is nasty,
how you doing it.

01:29:26.061 --> 01:29:27.928
Can I enjoy the wedding?

01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:30.130
All right, man.

01:29:30.132 --> 01:29:33.767
Ain't nothing wrong
with nasty, you know.

01:29:33.769 --> 01:29:36.069
Jerome...

01:29:36.071 --> 01:29:40.006
When I first met you,
I thought, "no more customers."

01:29:40.008 --> 01:29:44.811
I've already had three today.
My fun box can't have any more."

01:29:44.813 --> 01:29:47.114
Then we got to talking

01:29:47.116 --> 01:29:50.384
and you told me that you wanted
to use lube and I thought,

01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:54.621
"this is somebody that I need
to keep in my life forever."

01:29:54.623 --> 01:29:56.857
And although
I'm forever paralyzed,

01:29:56.859 --> 01:29:58.692
Jesus preaches forgiveness.

01:29:58.694 --> 01:30:01.762
So I forgive you
for paralyzing me forever,

01:30:01.764 --> 01:30:05.065
and more importantly,
I love you,

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:08.001
and I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:09.936
Do you, Jerome Gillespie,
take Trudy Garrett

01:30:09.938 --> 01:30:13.006
- to be your lawfully wedded wife?
- I do.

01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:14.908
And do you, Trudy Garrett,

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:17.177
take Jerome Gillespie to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

01:30:17.179 --> 01:30:19.079
I do.

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:21.648
By the power invested in me
in the state of California,

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:23.016
you are now husband and wife.

01:30:23.018 --> 01:30:24.518
You may kiss the bride.

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:30.524
Ooh! Whore of Babylon!

01:30:30.526 --> 01:30:32.793
Not you. You are not
the whore of Babylon.

01:30:32.795 --> 01:30:35.315
I love you. Your wheelchair is the whore of Babylon.
- I know.

01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:41.201
Ah!

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:50.710
Just climb on over. Yeah. Yep!

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:08.929
Thank you.

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.210
Should I...

01:31:23.212 --> 01:31:24.478
Am I...

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.581
- Yeah?
- We're fine.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:30.784
It is a beautiful day.

01:31:30.786 --> 01:31:33.520
Yeah, I mean, just
to finally get married

01:31:33.522 --> 01:31:35.222
after collecting all those stds

01:31:35.224 --> 01:31:37.824
like they were pokémon cards.

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:39.125
She's so lucky
to find a husband.

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:44.130
I kissed you.

01:31:44.132 --> 01:31:46.099
And on the mouth! Oh!

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.071
Oh!

01:32:00.182 --> 01:32:03.650
It's off. It's off.
Whore of Babylon!

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.687
Are you happy now?

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:18.632
Stick your finger in my mouth.

01:32:18.634 --> 01:32:21.001
Oh! Whore of Babylon!

01:32:21.003 --> 01:32:22.936
Oh!

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:39.119
I'm Theodore.

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:51.831
Let's not ruin this
with introductions.

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.304
We're gonna be happy.
It's gonna have a happy ending.

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:20.854
Why... why did you take
your pants off?

01:34:20.856 --> 01:34:22.989
Why don't you leave
the questions to me?

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:27.694
Well, the question
that I wanted to ask you is...

01:34:27.696 --> 01:34:29.329
Would you like
to sleep together?

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:35.135
No... no.

01:34:35.137 --> 01:34:36.403
I didn't mean it like that.

01:34:36.405 --> 01:34:39.139
I meant, do you wanna have sex?

01:34:39.141 --> 01:34:41.174
Are you joking or...

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:44.044
That's what I meant.
That's why my pants are off.

01:34:44.046 --> 01:34:46.179
No... no.

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:47.414
- I... I thought...
- No!

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:49.282
- There's something here...
- No.

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:52.786
I came here to do a serious
interview, I don't do porn,

01:34:52.788 --> 01:34:56.389
I'm retired.
I'm a classy lady, so... no.

01:34:56.391 --> 01:34:59.092
You're totally classy.
There's a bed right here,

01:34:59.094 --> 01:35:02.262
there's a pretty clear message,
I think, right there.

01:35:02.264 --> 01:35:04.964
I'm just saying,
let's take advantage

01:35:04.966 --> 01:35:06.432
of the opportunity
while we're here.

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:07.567
- No.
- While there's a bed.

01:35:07.569 --> 01:35:09.569
- No.
- I have a lubrication as well.

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:16.142
No, this isn't going well.
What's going on?

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:19.379
Oh, that's fine. Yeah, it's...
don't worry about that.

01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:22.849
But, okay, fine,
we won't have intercourse.

01:35:22.851 --> 01:35:25.118
That's fine. We don't have
to have intercourse.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:28.988
Why don't you just sit there
and I'll just touch myself...

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.157
Until I finish?

01:35:31.159 --> 01:35:33.126
You know what? This interview
is over, I'm sorry.

01:35:33.128 --> 01:35:34.161
You're disgusting.

01:35:34.963 --> 01:35:37.030
Mary, it's not
that big of a deal.

01:35:37.032 --> 01:35:39.365
- It's nothing you haven't experienced...
- okay, I'm done!

01:35:39.367 --> 01:35:41.835
I'm done, stop recording,
stop recording, I'm done.

01:35:41.837 --> 01:35:43.403
- It's not that big of a deal.
- No!

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:44.738
- Leaving.
- Let's go.

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:46.940
- No!
- Oh, come on.

01:35:46.942 --> 01:35:48.908
Go fuck yourself.

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:51.311
Well, I was trying to do that
but you got up.

01:35:51.313 --> 01:35:53.780
I would like to have you here
while I do that.

01:35:53.782 --> 01:35:56.182
- You're disgusting, I'm leaving. I'm done.
- Is that doable?

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:57.917
I don't...
