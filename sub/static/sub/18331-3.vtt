You guys ever try

01:16.618 --> 01:18.328
Who do you think we're texting?

01:19.871 --> 01:20.789
[all three laugh]

01:20.872 --> 01:22.874
[Ramona] That was a good one.
[Jackson] Yeah.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.962
Oh, man, it's 4:30,
gotta go Facetime Lola.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.632
Hey, sounds like
you're finally getting somewhere.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.842
Well, I'm actually Facetiming her brother,

01:32.926 --> 01:35.136
but with any luck
she'll be in the background.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.848
Jackson's my best friend.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.267
But man, he's got no game.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.814
He's been working Lola for eight months
and all he got was one pathetic pity peck.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.775
Yeah, the poor kid
called it a makeout session.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.860
Delusional.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.320
[giggles]

01:52.403 --> 01:54.656
So, how many guys have you kissed?

01:55.406 --> 01:56.699
None of your business.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.118
So, zero?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.871
I'm just waiting for the right guy.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.624
But I don't know if I'll ever find him
in our lame school.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.918
All of the boys are so immature.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.712
It's true. We're very childish.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.549
But hey, if I were you,

02:12.632 --> 02:15.343
I'd get that first kiss out of the way
so you know what you're doing.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.638
Maybe with someone
you don't like at all. Like me.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.558
You have a good point.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.601
I really don't like you.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.938
Then Popko's the guy
for all your makeout needs.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.314
Step into my office and...

02:29.190 --> 02:30.191
take a seat.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.486
OK.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.487
Let's do it.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.613
Really?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.323
[scoffs] That worked?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.327
Yes. I wanna get
my first kiss out of the way.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.496
Just stop talking before I change my mind.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.460
Wow.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.337
So that's what all the fuss was about.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.757
There's no way that was your first kiss.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.467
You were pretty good.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.178
One more and you'll really have it down.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.181
OK, let's do it again.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.771
Yuck!

03:10.315 --> 03:12.775
I watch TV on that couch.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.865
-Are you guys boyfriend and girlfriend?
-No. We don't even like each other.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.328
Just so you know, Cosmo,
when I kiss you that means I love you.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.707
You teenagers are so shallow.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.795
Tommy, can I have a bite?

03:34.547 --> 03:35.798
Mmm...

03:35.882 --> 03:37.759
Mmm! So good!

03:38.509 --> 03:40.261
Hi.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.055
Hey, Deej.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.059
[sighs] Stephanie, feed me too.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.230
[sighs] Something strained,
I'm too tired to chew.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.316
Well I've seen this before.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.194
A cup of tea, a hot bubble bath,
you'll be in bed by 9:30.

03:56.819 --> 03:57.946
So not true.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.031
I'll never make it to 9:30.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.909
Come on, let's go out.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.745
It's Saturday night. It's been ages
since we've had a sister night.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.665
Oh, you know what's in town?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.333
My favorite musical!

04:10.416 --> 04:12.418
We are not seeing Wicked again.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.713
But it's about sisters!

04:15.797 --> 04:17.548
And it's a sister night!

04:17.632 --> 04:18.549
Let it go.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.094
Oh, we could go to the Frozen singalong!

04:22.470 --> 04:25.014
You know what?
Just take your bubble bath and go to bed.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.642
What? OK, OK, OK.
Well, what do you wanna do?

04:27.725 --> 04:30.895
Well, you know, you've had a couple
rough weeks in the romance department.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.689
You let Steve and Matt get away,

04:32.772 --> 04:34.983
and then you got rejected by the UPS guy.

04:36.859 --> 04:37.944
What UPS guy?

04:38.027 --> 04:39.570
Well, I tried to set you up,

04:39.654 --> 04:42.615
but he said he wasn't available
for five to seven business days

04:42.699 --> 04:45.159
and then you'd have to be here
when he arrives.

04:47.078 --> 04:50.456
Look, the point is we need
to find you a good guy.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.834
No, I don't need a good guy.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.044
I just need a night out with my sister.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.631
Agreed, which is why you should
go and put on a pretty party dress

04:58.715 --> 05:00.925
and go out as if we were meeting guys,

05:01.009 --> 05:01.843
which we're not.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.595
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

05:04.679 --> 05:06.806
You guys better not be
going out without me.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.182
We're the she-wolf pack!

05:16.190 --> 05:18.568
Oh, sorry. Do you wanna go out with us?

05:18.651 --> 05:19.694
Nah, I'm busy.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.989
So where are we gonna go?

05:23.072 --> 05:26.326
We're gonna go to an amazing party
where everyone is dressed fabulously

05:26.409 --> 05:29.454
and we're gonna eat and drink
and dance for free. It's called a wedding.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.291
Ooh, I love weddings. Whose wedding?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.209
Don't know until we crash it.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
We're gonna be wedding crashers?

05:39.213 --> 05:41.049
I'm a good girl gone bad!

05:42.675 --> 05:44.177
Let's stay out till 10:30.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.345
I'll pay for it tomorrow,
but what the hey!

05:47.889 --> 05:50.058
Oh, yeah, you're one wild and crazy momma.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.271
Mom, I've got big news.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.942
-I can tell you anything, right?
-Of course you can, we're like sisters.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.028
In fact, we're like twin sisters.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.281
From a distance.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.420
When was it? Where was it? Who was it?

06:19.504 --> 06:22.381
Five minutes ago. Living room. Popko.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.092
Popko?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.386
That cocky little kid with the hat?

06:28.763 --> 06:30.765
I mean, that's great, honey.

06:31.849 --> 06:32.892
It's OK, Mom.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.354
I mean, I thought he was conceited too,
but now that I kissed him,

06:36.437 --> 06:37.814
he's not that bad.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.981
Really?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.609
Yeah, and he's kinda cute too.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.986
That pork pie hat is adorable.

06:45.113 --> 06:45.947
I know.

Now I think I kinda like him.

Aww.

Hey, Popko just texted me.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.666
He wants to know if you wanna go to the
movies with him and some friends tonight.

He does?

06:57.959 --> 06:59.502
He likes me too!

The Gibbler women are like man magnets.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.219
OK, tell him Ramona said, "Yeah, sure."

07:08.302 --> 07:11.055
Wait, no, no.
That sounds too desperate, right? Um...

07:11.139 --> 07:15.351
Say, "OK, whatever."
And type it just like I said it.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.688
OK, whatever.

Perfect!

07:25.945 --> 07:27.697
Excuse me, Ramona.

What are you doing?

07:38.958 --> 07:42.378
As a part of my One Kid
Can Make A Difference project,

07:42.462 --> 07:45.798
I'm watering your plants
with my recycled bathtub water.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.177
You're welcome.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.389
You're using dirty bath water?

07:54.056 --> 07:56.434
No, it has soap in it.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.604
So it's clean.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.440
Why aren't you smarter?

08:05.234 --> 08:07.528
Max, I have bigger problems here.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.783
What dress should I wear
on my first date with Popko?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.160
We're going to the movies.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.330
Wait. You have a date
with the kid you don't like.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.543
Yes. Because I changed my mind
and now I like him.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.004
I get it.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.590
I was the same way with Blake Shelton.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.389
There's just something about him.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.643
So, movie date.

in case you spill.

Blue or red?

You thought we were on a date?

Oh, yes, she did.

two feet taller than me,

Neither do I. Let's go see that movie.

That's right, Popko. You'd best walk away.

for a wedding you weren't invited to?

Because I'm not gonna show up
empty-handed.

And I thought you were dope, yo.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.014
All right. Hey, let's skip ahead, OK?

12:45.097 --> 12:48.684
Now, remember, the key
to crashing a wedding is to blend in.

12:48.767 --> 12:53.647
So if anyone asks, just make up
a fun name and a generic back story.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.233
Oh, can I do an Irish accent?

12:58.319 --> 12:59.987
Maybe. Let me hear it.

-But I dee-diddlee-dee-dee-dee...
-No. No.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.258
OK, I know I said that
we weren't coming here to meet guys,

13:21.342 --> 13:23.052
and I meant it when I said it,

13:23.135 --> 13:25.638
but now that we're here, look over there.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.477

13:31.560 --> 13:33.437
Stephanie, I am not here to meet men.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.315
Come on, this is a wedding!

13:36.398 --> 13:39.568
It's the only time single guys
fantasize about settling down.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.487
-Come on.
-No.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.865
I'm just here to have a fun night with
my sister and maybe have a good meal,

13:44.949 --> 13:45.866
that potato...

13:45.950 --> 13:48.953
-Hi.
-[Irish accent] Hi, yourself.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.955
That's a lovely dress you have on there.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.500
That's a lovely face you have on there.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.045
I'm Sean, what's your name?

13:59.129 --> 14:00.422
My name...

14:01.715 --> 14:04.385
My name is Sinead.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.345
O'Connor.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.559
So, Sinead, do you know
the bride or the groom?

14:12.601 --> 14:15.813
That depends. Do you know
the bride or the groom?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.482
I'm the groom's second cousin.

14:19.066 --> 14:23.028
Oh, well, in that case
I'm the bride's fifth cousin.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.865
From County Cork.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.658
Which is in Ireland.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.703
What happened to your accent?

14:30.786 --> 14:33.038
Oh, it was terrible so I dropped it.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.290
[laughs]

14:36.500 --> 14:41.463
So... Are you here with someone, or...

14:41.547 --> 14:44.550
-Oh. Just my sister.
-Oh.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.886
Carol.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.554
O'Connor.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.139
Right.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.599
Sister Carol!

14:53.517 --> 14:54.476
Meet Sean.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.853
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:55.936 --> 15:00.733
I was just telling him that we are from
County Cork, which is in Ireland.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.069
[whispers] I am so good at this!

15:05.404 --> 15:06.572

15:07.823 --> 15:09.325
I can hear both of you.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.289
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...

15:16.582 --> 15:18.417
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...

15:19.084 --> 15:20.794
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...

15:22.838 --> 15:25.716
Don't forget, when I get tired
you guys have to tickle me.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.009
[knocking at the window]

15:27.760 --> 15:30.012
Look, Tommy! It's Peter Pan.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.306
Came to take us to Neverland!

15:36.226 --> 15:38.187
Never mind, it's just Ramona.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.189
What are you doing here?

15:40.814 --> 15:42.149
I'm hiding from my parents.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.734
Why aren't you at the movies?

15:43.817 --> 15:47.237
I left early. I hated seeing Popko
on a date with that Bethany.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.614
You and me both.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.950
I need to hang out here
for a couple of hours,

15:51.033 --> 15:52.743
so my parents think I had fun tonight.

15:52.826 --> 15:56.163
They were so excited for me.
I just don't wanna let them down.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.165
Plus it's pretty embarrassing for you.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.585
Anyway,

16:02.127 --> 16:03.337
you're on tickle duty.

and so not on a date with a teenage boy.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.180
Why isn't she returning my texts?

Well, they already
made out this afternoon.

OK.

Was Señor Popko a gentleman?

23:37.499 --> 23:38.500
He was to me.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.418
He bought me popcorn and held the door.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.675
Hey! Ramona, how was your first date?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.552
Yeah, tell us everything.

[sighs] For the last time, it was romantic
and I'll remember it forever. Good night.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.435
What's wrong with Ramona?

23:57.519 --> 23:58.562
Here's what I know.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.568
At first, Ramona didn't like Popko.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.861
Then she kissed him.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.112
Then she liked him.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.614
Then he showed up with another girl,

24:10.198 --> 24:11.575
so she didn't like him.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.369
Or maybe she still did.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.955
That part's fuzzy.

24:18.665 --> 24:22.544
Then she snuck out of the movie theater,
hid in my room

24:22.627 --> 24:24.921
and helped me tickle a dog and a baby.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.799
I should talk to her.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.384
No, you stay here.

24:29.467 --> 24:30.552
This is a girl thing.

Like girl feelings and girl puberty and...

24:39.060 --> 24:40.854
You're right. I should stay here.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.524
She-wolf pack, upstairs.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.151
Mush.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.072
Man, I'm glad I'm a dude.

24:59.080 --> 24:59.915
Hey.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.084
Max told us what happened.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.586
Are you OK?

25:05.420 --> 25:06.922
Yes, I'm fine.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.716
I'm just never going on a date again.

25:10.383 --> 25:11.760
Not that I even went on one.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.054
I was so stupid.

25:14.846 --> 25:18.892
Oh, honey, you weren't stupid,
you just got caught up in your feelings.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.895
And out of all the boys to like.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.438
Why did I fall for Popko?

25:23.521 --> 25:24.773
He's such a jerk.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.691
I can answer this one.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.069
To quote the queen of disco, Donna Summer,

25:29.152 --> 25:32.447
"Bad, bad, bad, bad boys.
They make me feel so good."

25:36.493 --> 25:37.744
What?

25:37.827 --> 25:38.995
I mean, they do.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.538
Well, until they don't.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.334
Which is why you have to be
careful who you pick.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.169
Because some guys can be jerks.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.463
And some guys can... just like guys.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.049
But enough about my night.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.678
I think what they're trying to say

25:54.761 --> 25:58.265
is you have to make sure
whoever you're kissing is worthy of you.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.225
Because you are precious.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.020
Thanks, you guys.

26:05.647 --> 26:08.108
I could have used that speech
before my first kiss.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.151
Do you remember that joker, Rusty?

26:10.819 --> 26:11.653
Oh, yeah.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.405
Oh, yeah, New Year's eve!

26:13.488 --> 26:16.408
Yeah, I ate an onion
so that Rusty wouldn't kiss me.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.244
But then for some reason I kissed him.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.496
That's right.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.042
My first kiss was with some guy
at a spin the bottle party.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.295
Jake Bitterman!

26:29.296 --> 26:32.590
That's right, and yours
was the same night with Kevin Gwynn.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.968
Oh, Mylanta!

26:50.275 --> 26:52.152
[exhales violently] Happy New Year.

26:53.028 --> 26:53.903
Whoa! Mmm!

26:55.864 --> 26:56.906
Mommy!

27:01.077 --> 27:03.330
So your first kisses
weren't very special either?

27:04.289 --> 27:05.248
That makes me feel better.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.752
The good news is
your first kiss is not your last kiss.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.880
Yeah. You're gonna kiss a lot of boys.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.466
Well, hopefully not that many.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.219
Just know that I'm always here for you.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.262
Me too.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.097
So am I.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.223
Thanks.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.559
This three moms thing is kind of cool.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.897
You know what, I'd like to nominate Ramona

27:28.980 --> 27:32.108
to become an honorary
she-wolf pup in training.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.029
-I second.
-All in favor, say I.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.447
[all three] I.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.158
Are you ready
for your first official howl?

27:40.950 --> 27:41.951
I'm a little nervous.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.204
Oh, so was I, just do your best.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.289
