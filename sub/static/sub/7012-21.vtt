00:04.840 --> 00:07.360
Hey, Kelso.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.040
Well, that's a mighty big smile.
What, did you get into the Play-doh?

00:14.080 --> 00:18.520
No. I'm happy
'cause today is Gift Day.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.520
And in honor of this special day,
I got you all gifts.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.560
All right.
<i>Aerosmith Live.</i>

00:26.600 --> 00:28.600
Yeah, for my friend
who rocks.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.760
- Oh, man. The new <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
- For my friend who reads.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.280
Oreos!

00:37.360 --> 00:39.960
For my friend
who snacks.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.320
A triple-decker burn! Awesome!

00:51.920 --> 00:54.840
Wha... There's peanut butter
on my headphones!

00:54.920 --> 00:57.280
These cookies
are filled with toothpaste!

00:58.480 --> 01:01.440
All right. That noise
did not come out of my butt.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.280
Welcome to Prank Day.

01:04.319 --> 01:07.560
That's right.
It's Prank Day.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.440
"Gift Day."
You idiots.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.600
A whoopee cushion?
What are you, two?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.880
These things are great.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074

01:54.740 --> 01:58.020
- You got something in your ear, man.
- What?

01:58.100 --> 02:01.500
Oh, my goodness.
It's peanut butter!

02:01.580 --> 02:05.660
Ha-ha. Peanut butter wet willy.
Very clever.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.580
But the thing about it is,
you don't have to be clever.

02:08.660 --> 02:12.500
Okay! Okay!
This Prank Day is over.

02:12.580 --> 02:15.980
Let's just watch TV. Hey, Fez,
I think there's a <i>Nancy Drew</i> on.

02:16.060 --> 02:19.460
Oh! She can solve my mystery any day.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.580
And by the way,
the mystery is in my pants.

02:26.220 --> 02:28.660
Okay. That's it.
I got a peanut in my ear.

02:28.740 --> 02:32.300
Yeah. I used chunky, so it might
get up in your brain.

02:32.340 --> 02:37.900
Yeah. Ha-ha. Laugh it up now,
man, 'cause fun time is over.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.580
What the hell?
I'm stuck.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.060
I have been glued!

02:53.420 --> 02:56.620
Not glued, superglued.

02:56.660 --> 03:01.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa. So you covered the
freezer handle and the TV knob in superglue?

03:01.740 --> 03:06.580
Knowing Forman's love for Popsicles
and Fez's love for knobs!

03:08.540 --> 03:11.580
Yeah.
I'm an evil mastermind.

03:20.940 --> 03:24.860
Kelso, is there a cushion
glued to my butt?

03:24.940 --> 03:29.260
No. Not glued,
superglued.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.540
- You're a dead man.
- Yeah?

03:33.620 --> 03:36.580
What are you gonna do...
sit on me with your cushion-butt?

03:36.660 --> 03:40.100
It won't hurt, 'cause it's a cushion-butt.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.900
Ooh! Oh, my goodness.
Whoa!

03:46.420 --> 03:51.940
Okay. If you could be the princess in
any country, what country would it be?

03:52.020 --> 03:55.140
I pick Monaco.

03:55.220 --> 03:59.020
See, I always wanted
to wear my crown with a bikini.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.820
Donna, you're not listening to me!
This is my life here.

04:04.900 --> 04:10.140
Oh. Sorry. It's just... You know,
today would've been my parents' anniversary.

04:10.220 --> 04:13.100
But my mom's gone, my dad's with Joanne,
and Casey's out of town.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.340
So it just kind of sucks.

04:15.420 --> 04:20.860
You know what you need?
A little Jackie magic.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.300
- I am gonna dedicate my whole day to you.
- Oh, like you did last month...

04:24.380 --> 04:29.620
when I had to hold your corn dog and guard the
van while you and Kelso did it at the 4-H Fair?

04:32.420 --> 04:35.060
Yeah.
Wasn't that fun?

04:38.340 --> 04:42.300
Man, I can't wait to see this big bucket
of oatmeal landing on Kelso's...

04:42.380 --> 04:44.820
big bucket of a head.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.700
Well, good gracious,
who's all this oatmeal for?

04:52.020 --> 04:55.580
Uh, it's for
the oatmeal drive...

04:57.460 --> 05:00.260
for the Needy Oatmeal Lovers
of America.

05:02.180 --> 05:04.780
Right, the N.O.L.O.A.

05:09.380 --> 05:12.780
Oh, oh, this tastes awful.

05:12.820 --> 05:18.300
You know, just because they're hoboes doesn't
mean they don't respond to herbs and spices.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.340
You know what?
That's a good point, Mom...

05:20.420 --> 05:23.780
but you better leave, 'cause we don't like to
do our charity work in front of other people.

05:23.860 --> 05:28.740
Oh, now, don't be silly. I'll help you.
Where'd I put my brown sugar?

05:28.820 --> 05:31.180
Oh, I'm right here,
honey buns.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.620
Okay. I'm here
for our slumber party.

05:40.660 --> 05:43.980
Wow. When you said you were gonna
dedicate your whole day to me...

05:44.020 --> 05:47.820
I figured that meant only
until we left The Hub.

05:47.860 --> 05:51.100
No. I promised you
24 hours of Jackie time...

05:51.180 --> 05:54.780
which is equal to seven days
of an ugly person's time.

05:58.220 --> 06:01.100
Well, it's just, I'm in the middle
of this really good book.

06:01.180 --> 06:04.660
Donna, books are for prisoners.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.780
Now, I brought tons
of activities.

06:08.820 --> 06:13.620
First, some makeup for your
long-overdue facial overhaul.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.580
The greatest
board game ever...

06:18.660 --> 06:20.620
Mystery Date.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.460
And... Wait.
Best of all...

06:25.540 --> 06:27.860
my stuffed animals
so we can perform...

06:27.940 --> 06:31.380
an all-unicorn
rendition of <i>Grease.</i>

06:33.020 --> 06:38.100
This is perfect.
We are <i>so</i> gonna nail Kelso.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.940
I still say we should have
shaved his privates.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.220
That's a burn
that keeps on burnin'.

06:47.300 --> 06:51.220
- Kelso's on his way.
- Okay, gentlemen. Take your positions.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.060
Okay. I'm here.

06:57.140 --> 07:01.420
- Where's the dead bird?
- Kelso, you're supposed to come in through the side door.

07:01.460 --> 07:05.220
- What?
- Eric, I need you to take out the...

07:11.980 --> 07:14.100
You guys are so dead.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.840
What the hell is this?

07:27.040 --> 07:29.280
Eric did it
because he hates you.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.440
Hyde!

07:31.520 --> 07:33.760
Forman,
every man for himself.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.920
No, uh, Dad, this was just a prank
that's gone wrong...

07:38.000 --> 07:41.080
horribly, horribly wrong.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.360
Well, I've got
a prank too...

07:44.400 --> 07:48.440
one where my foot <i>doesn't</i>
plow through your ass.

07:48.520 --> 07:53.560
Let's hope it doesn't go horribly,
horribly wrong!

07:55.120 --> 07:57.040
Oh, Red.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.280
What happened to you?

08:02.360 --> 08:05.640
That oatmeal
was for the hoboes.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.520
Well, the idiots
used it for a prank.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.840
Eric, how many times have I told you,
don't poke the bear.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.600
Don't poke the bear!

08:17.360 --> 08:22.480
Well, technically, we didn't poke the bear.
We pour oatmeal on the bear.

08:22.560 --> 08:26.560
- Are you correcting my wife?
- Kelso's laughing at you.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.280
Are you laughing?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.799
Oh, come on.
You're covered in oatmeal!

08:32.880 --> 08:35.120
It's funny!

08:35.200 --> 08:38.559
- That's it!
- Oh, oh, you know what you should do, Red?

08:38.640 --> 08:43.520
Forgive and forget. Turn the other cheek,
like Jesus. Be like Jesus, Red.

08:44.880 --> 08:49.600
I can't even think of a punishment
big enough for this!

08:49.680 --> 08:53.440
But trust me,
it's going to be awful...

08:53.520 --> 08:58.840
the kind of thing that Harry Truman
might order to end a war!

09:04.520 --> 09:06.840
Guys, who's
Harry Truman?

09:06.920 --> 09:09.960
He invented electricity,
dumb-ass.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.120
Okay, Donna.
It's makeover time.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.320
Let's pack those jumbo pores.

09:21.320 --> 09:25.520
Um, you know what? I've thought about it,
and I'm glad my mom left.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.720
More food for me.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.720
- Oh, come on. It'll be fun.
- I doubt it.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.720
Unless...

09:39.840 --> 09:44.360
You were right, Donna.
Now, not only are we beautifying...

09:44.440 --> 09:47.280
but we're "groovifying."

09:47.360 --> 09:49.800
Hey, I just made up a word.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.400
Yeah. Who ever said you can't
do two great things at once?

09:56.440 --> 09:59.960
I bet it was a one-armed,
pessimistic guy.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.600
Yeah, you just gotta
stay positive, man.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.080
Like, I don't want
to learn French...

10:08.160 --> 10:11.840
so everyday I think positive thoughts
about not learning French.

10:11.920 --> 10:16.160
And look at me.
I don't know a word of French.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.160
Is Dad still
gonna kill me?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.800
Eric, I put him
in his Corvette...

10:25.880 --> 10:28.800
tuned the radio to a hockey game
and handed him a beer.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.440
I've done all I can.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.160
- Dad...
- All right.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.960
Just tell me. What the hell
did you think you were doing?

10:44.040 --> 10:48.760
Look, Kelso invented this stupid
Prank Day thing...

10:48.840 --> 10:51.720
and he superglued us,
so the oatmeal thing...

10:51.760 --> 10:54.480
was just to, you know,
get him back.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.240
And that's when my life
as I know it ended.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.080
Are you telling me,
I got covered with oatmeal...

11:03.120 --> 11:06.440
because you were trying
to get back at Kelso...

11:06.520 --> 11:09.640
which you didn't even do?

11:10.880 --> 11:13.920
Well, that's a bit of
an oversimplification.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.480
- I think if you look at the facts...
- You...

11:17.520 --> 11:20.840
The facts are,
you were bested by a Kelso.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.520
How could you do this
to your family?

11:25.600 --> 11:29.360
I didn't realize the honor of
our family was at stake.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.840
It always is.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.040
Hell, we've been talking
about this since T-ball...

11:36.080 --> 11:38.760
which you quit.

11:38.840 --> 11:44.360
I mean, what was there to be scared of?
The ball just sits there.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.440
All right.
Here's what I'm gonna do.

11:51.520 --> 11:56.600
Instead of punishing you, I'm gonna show you
how to do this prank business right.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.840
Now, get the Three Stooges
over to dinner tonight.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.880
You are going to help me
get them good and scared.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.240
Oh, well, no, Dad.
I don't wanna get Hyde and Fez.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.160
- They're on my team.
- Well, your team lost.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.920
So everybody cries.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.720
Well, hope you boys
like lasagna.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.520
Oh, boy, lasagna...
the Italian burrito.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.200
Thanks for havin' us over,
Mrs. Forman.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.560
Oh, don't thank me.
It was Red's idea.

12:37.640 --> 12:42.720
- Wait a minute. Red's coming?
- Uh, yeah. I can't believe you guys showed up.

12:42.800 --> 12:47.320
Wait. No. The only reason we showed up was
'cause you said Red was workin' late tonight.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.240
Oh, God, you know what?
He's in the kitchen. Should I just get him?

12:50.320 --> 12:53.640
No, you should not get him,
you son of a bitch.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.400
- I'm goin' out the window.
- Guys, calm down.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.600
Look, what could he
possibly do to us at dinner?

12:59.680 --> 13:03.560
Ah, good.
All the half-wits are here.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.080
I wanted
to let you know...

13:07.160 --> 13:10.080
that I'm going
to get you...

13:10.160 --> 13:13.800
and you won't know where,
and you won't know when.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.760
But...

13:15.800 --> 13:18.440
it will hurt.

13:18.520 --> 13:23.400
And you will cry,
and I will laugh, and...

13:23.440 --> 13:25.320
Did I mention
it will hurt?

13:26.480 --> 13:28.600
Very good.

13:28.680 --> 13:33.360
Now, enjoy the lasagna. I added
the special seasoning myself.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.720
Special seasoning?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.320
Uh-oh.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.480
All right.
Maybe it's because I'm extra clever...

13:41.520 --> 13:44.720
but I think that there might be
somethin' wrong with the lasagna...

13:44.800 --> 13:48.000
and I think maybe Red
had somethin' to do with it.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.880
Kelso...

13:50.960 --> 13:53.720
I wouldn't do anything
to the lasagna...

13:53.800 --> 13:58.200
just like I wouldn't do anything to your new
sneakers that are sitting by the kitchen door.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.200
My Chucks!

14:02.080 --> 14:04.400
Why isn't anybody eating?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.600
Is there something wrong
with my lasagna?

14:07.680 --> 14:11.240
We have reason to believe
it's been tampered with.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.040
Is this another prank?
Because I will not have this in my house.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.120
Now eat that lasagna.
It's perfectly fine.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.760
I said eat it!

14:27.440 --> 14:30.240
Mmm. Dad, what <i>is</i>
this special seasoning?

14:30.320 --> 14:34.320
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
Which reminds me.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.640
Kitty, I cleaned out the dead moths
from the porch light.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.560
If I could only remember
where I put them.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.160
- Aw, bugs? Sick!
- I'm out of here.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.800
Okay, Leo.
Who's your Mystery Date?

14:55.840 --> 14:59.640
All right.
The ski instructor.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.240
He's hunky.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.760
You know, Jackie, I never thought I'd say
this, but I'm actually having a good time.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.560
Wait. Michael,
what are you doing here?

15:13.640 --> 15:16.560
Yeah, man.
This is girls' night.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.200
Jackie, I just had dinner with Red,
and he totally freaked me out.

15:23.280 --> 15:27.400
So, first I need you to
stick your hand in my Chucks.

15:27.480 --> 15:31.360
Then I need you to hang out with me,
because I'm really afraid to be alone.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.400
- No. No, Michael. I am spending time with Donna.
- Okay, but...

15:37.480 --> 15:41.520
I was gonna take you to the mall and tell
everyone you were a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.240
Wait, wait. You never want to do that.
Okay. Let's go.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.280
Huh.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.320
I guess it's just
you and me, Leo.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.080
A whole pan of lasagna wasted...

16:05.160 --> 16:07.080
and it's a recession.

16:09.720 --> 16:13.680
- Kitty, you don't understand.
- I understand that you need to start acting like a parent.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.720
But we have different
responsibilities as parents.

16:17.800 --> 16:22.480
Your job is to tell him
that he's cute and to clean his ears.

16:23.920 --> 16:28.200
My job is to make him a man,
which he's not.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.840
Dad, I'm...

16:33.920 --> 16:36.000
I'm right here.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.040
Shut up, boy.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.160
You see how he shuts up?
That's not right.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.920
I give up.

16:50.960 --> 16:55.160
- Wow, she seems mad.
- Ah, she'll burn it off on her Exercycle.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.160
- We really did freak out those guys tonight, huh?
- Hmm!

17:01.200 --> 17:06.920
Now, it's time to go after Kelso...
the head dummy.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.119
And we're gonna have
the junior dummies help us out.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.680
You know what?
We make a good team.

17:15.760 --> 17:20.680
It's like I'm Batman, and you're...
Er... No. You're... You're Batman.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.560
Hey, Donna? Wait.
Where's Leo?

17:28.600 --> 17:33.920
Oh, he left. He asked if he could try on
my dad's clothes, and I said no, so he left.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.640
What? He left?

17:36.720 --> 17:40.680
That jerk.
What a bad friend.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.640
Jackie, you left too.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.920
I know, I know. Look, that's why I'm here.

17:46.960 --> 17:51.200
I was at the mall signing autographs
for a bunch of sixth graders.

17:52.440 --> 17:56.080
You know,
"Go, Cowboys. Love, Jackie."

17:57.680 --> 17:59.840
And then I saw
this little girl crying...

17:59.920 --> 18:01.960
'cause she couldn't
find her mom...

18:02.040 --> 18:05.480
and she reminded me of you,
so I felt bad.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.720
Jackie, that's so sweet.
So what happened with the little girl?

18:08.800 --> 18:11.840
- She find her mom?
- You know what? I don't know.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.680
I left her with the snow-cone guy.
Yeah. She smelled like poo.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.640
Look, anyways,
my point is...

18:21.680 --> 18:24.560
you know, since you don't have
your mom around anymore...

18:24.640 --> 18:28.400
you need a girl in your life to look
after you, and that's gonna be me.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.200
- Unless I smell like poo.
- Right.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.440
So when Kelso gets here,
he'll walk by the driveway...

18:39.520 --> 18:42.680
which we've iced down
with the hose...

18:42.760 --> 18:46.440
and he'll see a nudie magazine
lying there...

18:46.480 --> 18:51.280
which is perfect for Kelso,
because he can never resist a boob.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.040
- Well, who among us can?
- Right.

18:55.120 --> 19:00.360
So, he'll sprint towards it, slip on the ice
and slide into a giant pile of mud.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.080
Get ready.
I hear footsteps.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.720
- What are we lookin' at?
- Kelso?

19:17.800 --> 19:20.440
Wait, wait. If you're here,
then who is in the driveway?

19:20.520 --> 19:23.080
Oh, crap!

19:26.400 --> 19:29.920
Well, the driveway
was all icy, and I fell.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.280
I think I heard a pop.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.200
- Mrs. Forman, we are so sorry.
- Mom, are you okay?

19:35.280 --> 19:37.720
Okay. Fez, grab her legs.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.200
Get away from her!

19:44.560 --> 19:46.520
Eric, you're grounded
for a week.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.320
But this prank
was your idea!

19:50.360 --> 19:53.320
- Fine. Two weeks!
- Wha...

19:53.400 --> 19:56.880
And the rest of you, get the hell outta here.
Go on now.

19:58.640 --> 20:03.120
Well, this was another prank?

20:03.200 --> 20:06.760
See what happens
when you act like a jackass?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.720
Kitty, I am so sorry...

20:12.800 --> 20:16.080
and I promise:
No more pranks, ever.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.880
Okay.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.000
- So, we're done here.
- Wait!

20:25.760 --> 20:28.360
You're not hurt.
You were faking it.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.920
Oh, don't sound so surprised.
I fake things plenty.

20:41.540 --> 20:45.580
- Wait. So you're not hurt at all?
- Nope.

20:46.900 --> 20:49.060
Wow.
You out-pranked Dad.

20:49.140 --> 20:52.100
No, no, no. It wasn't a prank.
It was a lesson.

20:53.940 --> 20:56.340
And yes, I did.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.780
So, you're the best Forman.

21:01.940 --> 21:04.580
You're Batman.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.420
Now you know.
