WEBVTT

00:13.055 --> 00:15.057
Welcome back to Clash
of the Cupcakes.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.434
Thank you, DJ Sweet Treats.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.145
Right now, I have to share
some rather unpleasant news.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.772
Uh, we were supposed to have some
very special guest judges today,

00:21.856 --> 00:23.065
specifically five of them,

00:23.149 --> 00:25.276
the legendary dance
crew Jabbawockeez.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.360
But, uh, I got here today,

00:26.444 --> 00:27.778
and I didn't see 'em.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.906
Hey!

00:30.990 --> 00:32.116
I don't want to hear that.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.200
They were supposed to be here.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.201
I don't know what happened.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.859
Give it up for the Jabbawockeez!

01:06.942 --> 01:09.403
We'll be right back with
more Clash of the Cupcakes.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.036
Hey, Dev.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.704
Uh, great job, man, great job.

01:18.788 --> 01:21.207
Uh, we got a small issue on
the last segment, though.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.416
What's up, Lawrence?

01:22.500 --> 01:25.169
So the Jabbawockeez, they
don't take their masks off.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.837
They need to take the
masks off, right?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.047
They gotta taste the cupcakes.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.673
I don't know. Apparently,
it's in their contract

01:29.757 --> 01:31.217
that they don't take
their masks off.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.052
Like, somebody should have
read that beforehand.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.261
Yeah, somebody, you.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.513
You're the producer
that booked 'em.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.556
Ah, damn.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.557
For real?

01:38.641 --> 01:40.017
We gonna play the blame game?

01:40.101 --> 01:41.644
Maybe what we should be doing

01:41.727 --> 01:43.229
is putting our big boy pants on

01:43.312 --> 01:44.563
to figure out a solution.

01:44.647 --> 01:47.191
All right, Lawrence,
what if, you know,

01:47.274 --> 01:48.692
some of the guys are
dancing in the front

01:48.776 --> 01:50.277
and then one of the Wockeez

01:50.361 --> 01:52.613
just dips behind the table
and eats the cupcakes there?

01:52.696 --> 01:54.073
See what happens when
we have teamwork,

01:54.156 --> 01:55.449
when we work together?

01:55.533 --> 01:56.784
That was just my idea.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.494
Oh, oh.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.663
So we're just going right
back to being childish, huh?

02:00.746 --> 02:04.041
I'm just gonna go let the
Wockeez know our idea.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.835
Jesus.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.379
Hey, Dev.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.797
Hey, what's up, Lisa?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.257
Just coming in for
a quick touch-up.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.424
Sure.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.426
So you're Indian, right?

02:14.510 --> 02:15.427
Yes.

02:15.511 --> 02:16.929
Well, I'm friends
with this Indian guy

02:17.012 --> 02:17.930
I think you might know.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.723
Come on, you're not gonna do
that shit, are you, Lisa?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.851
You don't go up to white people and
go, "Hey, you're white, right?

02:21.934 --> 02:23.477
I know this white person.
You might know 'em?"

02:23.561 --> 02:25.813
Well, he said he went to
college with you. Rohan?

02:26.397 --> 02:27.481
All right, I do know him.

02:27.565 --> 02:28.607
- Hmm.
- My bad.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.818
That's the only time in history
that hasn't been racist.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.903
Uh, Dev, urn, one more thing.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.072
When we sign off,
make sure you go,

02:35.156 --> 02:37.575
"Thank you to the Jabbawockeez
for blessing the stage."

02:37.658 --> 02:38.742
No, I'm not saying that.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.286
But you have to. It's
in the contract.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.495
And when you say it,

02:41.579 --> 02:43.330
make sure you put a
little pizzazz in it.

02:43.414 --> 02:44.623
Why didn't anyone
read the contract?

02:44.707 --> 02:46.417
I did read the contract.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.710
I skimmed it.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.086
I didn't skim too well.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.254
I missed a couple of things.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.506
- Jesus.
- Shit.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.632
You're stressing me out.

02:53.716 --> 02:55.801
- Lawrence.
- Huh?

02:55.885 --> 02:58.137
You really need to floss while
we're doing our tapings?

02:58.220 --> 03:00.222
Hell yeah. I don't
fuck with plaque.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.141
That shit like termites
for your teeth.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.144
Motherfucker don't
even want me to floss.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.354
The competition is over,

03:48.437 --> 03:50.981
and it's time for these
cupcakes to clash.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.984
What will be the judges'
cupcake conclusion?

03:54.068 --> 03:57.029
Wockeez, it's time
for the taste tests.

04:01.784 --> 04:03.118
The Jabbawockeez
have a very strict

04:03.202 --> 04:04.703
don't-take-their-masks-off
policy,

04:04.787 --> 04:08.165
hence the dance routine instead
of a traditional taste.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.627
I don't know if it's

04:11.710 --> 04:13.587
a secret identity
issue or what it is,

04:13.671 --> 04:16.632
but really doesn't seem
like a big deal to me.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.013
All right, guys, it's
a 30-minute show.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.181
Let's speed it up here.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.982
Really just need you to
take a bite of the cupcake.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.405
And the dance is over...

04:39.488 --> 04:40.656
finally.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.867
What is your decision?

04:50.916 --> 04:52.209
And the winner is

04:52.293 --> 04:53.752
Jake's Cakes from
Henderson, Nevada,

04:53.836 --> 04:56.422
with their Red Velvet
Underground cupcakes.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.465
Thank you so much for watching.
My name is Dev Shah.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.925
This has been Clash
of the Cupcakes.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.844
And I also want to
thank the Jabbawockeez

05:01.927 --> 05:04.346
for... blessing the stage.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.431
We'll see you next time.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.640
Stay sweet, America.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.738
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

05:20.821 --> 05:22.072
Jesus!

05:22.156 --> 05:22.990
It's just us.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.074
How'd you guys get back here?

05:24.158 --> 05:25.576
Oh, there's no security.
We just walked in.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.660
It was really easy.

05:26.744 --> 05:27.828
Figures.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.663
Thank you so much for
this experience.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.248
We never thought
we'd see the Wockeez

05:31.332 --> 05:32.458
so up close and personal.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.460
You know we're
huge Wockee heads.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.461
Can we go meet them now?

05:35.544 --> 05:36.712
- We're so pumped.
- Please, please.

05:36.795 --> 05:37.921
Yeah, sure.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.173
'Yes! 'Yes!

05:40.841 --> 05:42.509
Did you guys rehearse that?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.261
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.975
Hey, guys, I-I had some friends

05:50.059 --> 05:51.643
that just wanted to say
hello if that's cool.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.605
Oh, my God.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.190
It's Joe "Punkee" Larot,

05:56.273 --> 05:58.025
Rynan "Kid Rainen" Paguio,

05:58.108 --> 05:59.693
Phil "Swagger Boy" Tayag.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.070
How do you know who's who?

06:01.153 --> 06:03.155
I can tell by their movements.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.783
You guys, that might have
been your best performance

06:05.866 --> 06:08.619
since your dance with Taylor Swift
at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.121
Yeah, it was even better
than your routine with Shaq

06:11.205 --> 06:12.915
at the 2009 All-Star Game.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.542
And by the way, I'm Arnold,
and this is Brian.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.628
And we know it's against
Wockee code to talk,

06:17.711 --> 06:18.962
but we just wanted
to come give you

06:19.046 --> 06:21.006
a quick Jabba bow to
pay our respects.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.139
All right, what the fuck'?

06:29.223 --> 06:30.307
Okay, that's good, guys.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.309
I'm sure the Wockeez have
somewhere to go dance.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.603
Take care, guys.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.313
Did I seem cool around them?

06:36.397 --> 06:37.523
Dude, you did so great.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.317
Thanks for hooking us up, man.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.111
Hey, do you want to
grab dinner later?

06:42.194 --> 06:44.947
I can't. I'm actually grabbing
dinner with Jeff Pastore tonight.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.741
Wait, the Jeff Pastore, the TV guy,
Chef Jeff?

06:47.825 --> 06:49.368
Yeah. He's a producer
on the show.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.452
He's kind of my boss.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.954
Wow, I love Jeff's Table.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.539
Did you ever see that
Vietnam episode?

06:53.622 --> 06:55.082
It was pho-nomenal.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.670
Did anyone ever say that before?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.713
Probably. At some point.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.173
I don't know. It's pretty good.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.299
I've never heard it.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.217
What are you guys doing now?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.677
Um, some friends of mine
from Italy are in town.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.762
Remember Francesca and Pino? We're
going to the Brooklyn Museum.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.556
- Care to join?
- No can do, bud.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.683
We're heading up to Queens
to the Kids Foot Locker.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.768
The Wockeez are doing a
little in-store blessing.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.687
We got to get those primo seats.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.188
Arnie, you're gonna block
all these kids' views.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.023
First come, first served.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.367
Buona sera!

07:30.451 --> 07:32.786
Buona sera!

07:32.870 --> 07:34.204
Shah!

07:34.288 --> 07:35.789
Hi.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.207
- Wow.
- It's so good to see you!

07:37.291 --> 07:38.375
I can't believe you're here!

07:38.459 --> 07:39.376
Neither can I.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.377
You're still Italian.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.587
Yes.

07:41.670 --> 07:42.588
How are you?

07:42.671 --> 07:43.881
I'm good.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.257
Where's your boyfriend, Mr.
Pino?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.134
Well, he had to work.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.386
He's meeting some
tile distributors.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.471
So it's just me.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.889
Well, the man loves tiles.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.891
So New York City?
Your first visit?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.184
What do you think?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.853
I don't know. There's
so much stuff here.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.521
Yeah. You should put
that on a shirt.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.315
New York City: There's
so much stuff here.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.941
Well, no, I mean it.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.068
I mean, I've been walking
all day through the city

08:05.152 --> 08:06.612
just staring at the
building like this.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.155
Ah!

08:08.238 --> 08:09.573
- I love it.
- Ah.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.241
Well, that is adorable.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.409
I gotta tell you
something, though.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.203
I am very hungry-

08:14.286 --> 08:15.829
Is there any way we can
see the entire museum

08:15.913 --> 08:18.332
in, like, three minutes
and then go get food?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.294
What does that mean?

08:22.377 --> 08:23.837
If you're good, I'll
give you a cookie.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.130
- Yay! Deal.
- Deal.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.216
Come on. Let's go in.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.263
- Oh, how is the cupcake show going?
- It's all right.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.265
It's not the most inspiring
gig, but it's okay.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.475
Hmm.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.353
Can I be honest?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.063
Oh, God. Go ahead.
Have your fun.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.273
Shit on Clash of the
Cupcakes all you want.

08:43.357 --> 08:47.444
Okay, I don't understand why
do people watch this show?

08:47.528 --> 08:51.865
It's just a show about
watching people eat cupcakes.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.158
I don't know.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.409
I just host it, all right?

08:54.493 --> 08:56.370
I say the contestants' names,

08:56.453 --> 08:58.455
and I announce the
winners at the end.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.582
Really?
That's all you do?

09:00.666 --> 09:02.084
Couldn't they just write
it on the screen?

09:02.167 --> 09:05.087
They do, but I say it
in a really enthusiastic way.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.421
- Okay, wait.
- It's very important.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.465
I want to hear that.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.883
Right now?

09:09.967 --> 09:10.968
Yes, right now.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.094
Come on. Do it.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.679
- No way.
- Please!

09:13.762 --> 09:15.264
We don't have this
kind of show in Italy.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.307
Please, do it for me just once.
Please.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.892
Please? Please?

09:18.976 --> 09:20.769
Please?

09:20.852 --> 09:22.980
Please welcome, all the
way from Cleveland,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.607
Karen from Karen's Confections!

09:27.192 --> 09:28.360
That was awful.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.114
Ah.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.908
So this is the piece that
I really wanted to see.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.702
It's called The Dinner Party.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.245
Cool.

09:38.328 --> 09:42.040
Is it me or do all these
look like vaginas?

09:42.124 --> 09:45.419
Yeah, it's kind of like saying
that all these women across history

09:45.502 --> 09:47.045
have been discriminated against

09:47.129 --> 09:48.922
just because they have vaginas.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.257
Whoa.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.509
Did this lady have
a piano vagina?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.928
I'm never going to a
museum with you again.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.517
Oh, how was the-- the
date the other night?

10:00.601 --> 10:01.518
It was fun.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.979
I had a lovely evening with
this woman named Priya.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.606
Oh. Priya.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.024
- Oh.
- Where did you meet her?

10:07.107 --> 10:10.152
I met her on, uh, one
of those dating apps.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.070
What are dating app?

10:12.154 --> 10:13.530
It's like these
apps on your phone

10:13.614 --> 10:14.823
where you see people's faces,

10:14.906 --> 10:16.825
and when you see a face you
like, you hit a button,

10:16.908 --> 10:18.827
and if they hit a
button on your face,

10:18.910 --> 10:20.787
then you have a match.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.205
And then you can send
each other messages

10:22.289 --> 10:23.665
and then you go out on a date.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.542
Wow, when you say it out
loud, it sounds insane.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.918
No, it sounds crazy.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.421
It is, but you meet people.
You know?

10:29.504 --> 10:30.922
I had a good time with Priya.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.925
Okay, then tell me about
your night with her.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.677
Um, well, we went to a wine bar.

10:35.761 --> 10:36.678
Mm.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.138
And then we went
to this roof bar.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.181
Mm.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.308
And then we had some
kissing in the cab.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.768
Oh.

10:42.851 --> 10:43.977
And then what?

10:44.061 --> 10:46.188
Did you call her the day after?

10:46.271 --> 10:49.024
I sent her a nice text message
that night that said...

10:49.107 --> 10:50.984
Oh, that's sweet.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.988
..."Hey, Priya, thanks
for a lovely evening.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.573
I'm jealous of the lucky pillow

10:56.657 --> 10:58.450
that gets to hold your
beautiful face tonight."

10:58.533 --> 10:59.743
That's nice, right?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.621
What? That's a nice text.

11:02.704 --> 11:03.997
If you got a text
like that from a guy,

11:04.081 --> 11:05.332
you wouldn't be like,
"Oh, that's sweet"?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.501
No, I would do, like, "Ugh."

11:07.584 --> 11:11.088
Well, Priya said, "Ugh, let's
get dinner on Thursday."

11:11.171 --> 11:12.214
I'm right. You're wrong.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.256
I win. You lose.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.592
I'm out. Goodbye.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.594
I'm gonna keep
looking at vaginas.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.934
Hi, um, I'm having
dinner with Chef Jeff.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.019
Ah, yes, of course.
He's right this way.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.950
Uh-oh! Here he is!

11:40.033 --> 11:42.160
Come here.
Bring it in, huh?

11:42.244 --> 11:44.246
- Bring it in, brother.
- Hey, how's it going?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.789
Good, man. Good to
finally meet you.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.124
I'm sorry it's taken so long.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.834
Oh, no problem. Uh, my pleasure.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.210
And now, full disclosure.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.045
It's my third dinner tonight.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.005
- Wow. That's a lot of dinners.
- Yeah, it's not my fault, man.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.424
You know, I just
wandered into Shuko,

11:55.507 --> 11:56.883
say hi to my friend
Nick, he's all,

11:56.967 --> 11:58.427
"Chef, you gotta try this tuna."

11:58.510 --> 11:59.636
Story of my life, right?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.012
Next thing you know,
I'm ten courses deep

12:01.096 --> 12:02.597
- into the tasting menu.
- Mm-hmm.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.099
So then I pop in to Casa Mono

12:04.182 --> 12:05.726
to have a drink with a
friend, just one drink,

12:05.809 --> 12:07.144
next thing you know,
I'm knee-deep

12:07.227 --> 12:08.687
in the best paella
I've had all year.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.480
Crazy fuckin' night.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.773
Ah, well, full disclosure.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.442
This is my first dinner,

12:13.525 --> 12:15.402
and for lunch I had
a boring salad.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.029
I ate half. Next thing you know,
I'm throwing it in the trash.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.239
That's what you do.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.282
Gentlemen, compliments
of the chef,

12:20.365 --> 12:21.533
octopus pizzaiolo,

12:21.616 --> 12:23.493
beef carpaccio Piemontese,

12:23.577 --> 12:26.288
and some fresh mozz that
we made here in the house.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.539
Thank you, Tim.

12:27.622 --> 12:28.665
Tim, one second.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.417
There's something wrong
with the mozzarella.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.461
Yep, just what I thought.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.337
It's fuckin' delicious. We're
gonna need another round.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.839
- You got it.
- Hey, hold me back, Tim.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.425
Hold me back. Dinner number three.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.385
What do you say you and I have
a heart attack tonight, huh?

12:40.469 --> 12:41.386
That sounds pretty fun.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.596
I think you might
really have one.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.014
I love it, man.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.265
Now, a little birdie told me

12:45.348 --> 12:47.017
you spent some time in Italia.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.226
True or false?

12:48.310 --> 12:49.686
Uh, the little birdie
was telling the truth.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.022
I lived in Modena for a few months,
learned how to make pasta.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.316
You're kidding me. Modena?
Home of tortellini in brodo.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.151
We went there a couple years
ago with Jeff's Table.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.319
Best episode ever.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.445
- You see that one?
- Yeah, it was great.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.362
You remember that
fuckin' scene--

12:59.446 --> 13:00.405
Remember that scene
where I'm sitting there

13:00.489 --> 13:03.033
with the old guy in the
cafe with the hat?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.534
I actually didn't see it.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.827
You just seemed so fired up,

13:05.911 --> 13:07.162
I wanted to tell you I saw it.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.705
I love it. I'll send you a link.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.831
- All right.
- All right.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.334
Hey, Tim. Where the fuck
is that mozzarella?

13:12.417 --> 13:13.585
I'm kidding.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.086
I love you. I mean it.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.922
I'm inviting you to
my next barbecue.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.757
You better be there,
you son of a bitch.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.218
I got him the job.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.181
This is so good.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.557
Yeah. All right.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.809
Favorite taco in New York.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.269
Mm, Los Tacos Number
1, the al pastor.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.479
Fuckin' kidding me, bro?

13:32.562 --> 13:33.647
Me too. I love that place.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.731
Holy shit.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.733
Hey, pastor pals over here.

13:36.817 --> 13:37.984
You know where I gotta take you?

13:38.068 --> 13:39.152
El Ferron.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.571
Playa del Carmen, Mexico.
Look at this.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.906
- Look at that al pastor.
- Oh!

13:42.989 --> 13:44.157
- Right?
- That looks good.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.575
Have you ever gotten
sexually charged

13:45.659 --> 13:46.660
from looking at a
picture of al pastor?

13:46.743 --> 13:48.286
'Cause I'm a rocket right now.
God damn.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.621
Look at that. Anything?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.122
I'm not erect, but it
does look really good.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.166
I love your passion.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.793
You and I, we're gonna be having

13:54.876 --> 13:56.378
a lot of food together,
I have a feeling.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.047
In fact, what are you doing this Friday?
You around?

13:59.130 --> 14:01.049
I'm having a going away
dinner at my place.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.425
Love to have you and a guest.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.885
I'm there. Who's going away?

14:03.969 --> 14:06.555
I am. I'm doing a pop-up dinner
in Stonehenge next week.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.515
Speaking of which, I got
dinner number four.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.308
I'm meeting some people from
my new charity, Jeff's Kids.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.768
Love those kids.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.936
Don't have a heart attack.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.604
Timmy, can we get a check?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.439
Oh, Chef, the meal's
compliments of the house.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.983
God damn it, you son of a bitch!

14:18.066 --> 14:18.984
You son of a bitch!

14:19.067 --> 14:19.985
They do this all the time.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.027
All right, tell him thanks.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.571
Oh, shit. I almost forgot.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.406
Bottle of champagne there,
I brought that for you.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.699
You didn't have to do this.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.950
Hey.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.618
We're pastor pals. Okay?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.787
- FaceTime me.
- I will.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.372
Damn.

14:52.976 --> 14:53.935
Talk to me, buddy.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.438
I need the game plan. Give
it to me step-by-step.

14:56.521 --> 15:00.859
All right, start it off
with some cocktails at PDT.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.444
Ooh, masterful.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.154
Classy cocktails. It's hidden.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.197
It's intimate. I love it.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.658
- You been to this bar before?
- Yeah.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.660
- It's good cocktails, right?
- Yeah.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.746
Hey, guys, flat or sparkling?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.122
Uh, sparkling, please.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.832
Uh, I'll do flat.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.584
So how was your day?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.002
It was good.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.589
Um, we did a taping of
Clash of the Cupcakes.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.257
Uh, you know we had
that dance crew

15:24.341 --> 15:25.884
the Jabbawockeez on
earlier this week?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.385
Who is that?

15:27.469 --> 15:28.970
They're like these guys.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.680
They, like, dance
and have masks.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.848
They were really good.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.058
Cool.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.267
Um, how about you?

15:34.351 --> 15:35.352
How was your day?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.771
Yeah, it was a
pretty normal day.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.065
Just meetings and whatnot.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.358
All right.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.613
Went with sparkling water, huh?

15:46.696 --> 15:47.614
Yeah.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.491
I'm more of a flat water guy.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.701
Sometimes I'll do sparkling
water with lemon.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.787
That's fun.

15:53.870 --> 15:54.871
I like flat water too.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.998
I mean, they're both good.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.500
Yeah.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.377
They both are good.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.547
Okay, where are we
headed to next?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.842
For dinner, I'm thinking
something fun, festive:

16:07.926 --> 16:09.386
a little barbecue.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.720
No. Not authorized.

16:10.804 --> 16:11.638
What? Why?

16:11.721 --> 16:13.556
You'll have that sticky
sauce all over your face.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.557
That's not a cute look.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.309
Ooh, good point.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.228
See, this is why we
have these talks.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.521
How about this?

16:19.604 --> 16:21.982
Dinner at Il Buco.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.192
Perfecto. Pasta: me likey.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.531
So, urn, should we
split a few pastas?

16:29.614 --> 16:32.117
Oh, I don't really
love splitting.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.536
I'd kind of rather just order
for myself if that's okay.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.579
Yeah, of course.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.331
But...

16:38.415 --> 16:40.875
they do encourage sharing.
You sure?

16:40.959 --> 16:42.836
Yeah, I think I'm just
gonna get the fish.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.295
All right.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.547
Don't ask for a bite of mine.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.548
- All right.
- No, you can--

16:46.631 --> 16:47.882
You can have a bite.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.677
Um...

16:55.724 --> 16:57.684
Doing anything fun
for the weekend?

16:57.767 --> 17:00.937
Um, yeah, I'm going
to a Rangers game.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.230
Are you into hockey?

17:02.313 --> 17:03.940
I know of hockey.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.609
Um, I've never been
to a game, though,

17:06.693 --> 17:07.694
or watched one on TV.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.696
- But I've heard it's fun.
- It's fun.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.739
Yeah.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.450
I grew up watching a bunch
of sports with my dad.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.119
What about you? Do you
watch any sports?

17:16.953 --> 17:18.246
I do not.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.458
Thank you.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.628
So here, I guess they
just pour you flat water.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.297
They don't even ask.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.840
Interesting.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.467
Hmm. Yeah.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.970
I like how there's no ice.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.682
Sometimes water gets
a little too cold.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.684
Yeah, this is a
good temperature.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.401
Drinks, dinner, you got
me nibbling on the bait.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.611
Now, reel me in, Cap.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.614
I mean, I think after
dinner we should just

17:52.697 --> 17:54.324
have a nice little drink
back at my place.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.283
Wait a second.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.118
A night cap with my Cap'?

17:57.202 --> 17:58.620
Wonderful. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.330
I told you Arnie's big
toe is sensitive.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.664
Please be careful, okay?

18:01.748 --> 18:03.083
It's the third time I told you.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.626
Sorry, bud.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.753
Thank you so much for dinner.
That was great.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.046
Yeah. That place is good, right?

18:08.129 --> 18:09.589
Yeah. Yeah.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.508
Um, do you want to come
over and have a drink?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.510
Oh, um, you know, I
think I'm just gonna

18:13.593 --> 18:14.636
grab a cab and head home.

18:14.719 --> 18:15.762
I'm kind of tired.

18:15.845 --> 18:16.763
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.972
But thank you again for dinner.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.224
Yeah, that was really fun.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.308
Yeah, it was really fun.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.601
- All right.
- All right, bye.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.732
Fuck. That wasn't fun at all.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.237
So how'd date number
two with Priya go?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.988
Ugh. Not good.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.032
Every conversation
was a struggle.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.784
I don't think I'm gonna take
her to that Chef Jeff dinner.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.536
Dude, just take her. She's hot.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.537
And you got no one else.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.871
You're alone.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.581
Yeah, but it's gonna
be a fun night.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.042
I want to take someone I'll
have a good time with.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.043
Maybe I'll take my morn.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.044
That could be sweet.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.462
What are you, a loser?

18:49.546 --> 18:50.880
You can't take your mom.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.674
There's gonna be
cool people there.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.259
And this ain't Leo
at the Oscars.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.385
You gotta bring a date.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.388
Every girl in my phone hates me.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.682
- Or I hate them.
- Mm.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.475
What about Jennifer Lopez?

19:02.559 --> 19:04.477
Why would that be a possibility?

19:04.561 --> 19:06.271
Because she just broke
up with her boyfriend,

19:06.354 --> 19:07.856
Casper Smart, the dancer.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.065
And I know her nanny.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.692
And she probably
watches Cupcakes.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.277
I highly doubt it.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.695
Dude, then take Priya.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.072
I'm getting sick
of this problem.

19:16.156 --> 19:19.075
Can you come to the store
with me and get a vacuum?

19:19.159 --> 19:20.827
No. I'm gonna go home.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.036
So we talk about your shit,

19:22.120 --> 19:23.454
but when I need a
friend to give me

19:23.538 --> 19:25.206
a second opinion on
a vacuum, you bail?

19:25.290 --> 19:26.499
Fine. I'll come.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.794
Nah, I'm tired. I'm
gonna take a nap.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.943
Wow, nice apartment.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.195
Bella.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.948
This party's so cool.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.992
I mean, it's different
than I expected.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.702
Really? What were you expecting?

20:02.785 --> 20:03.703
I don't know.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.998
Something like hamburgers
and girls in bikinis?

20:07.081 --> 20:07.999
Why did you expect that?

20:08.082 --> 20:09.626
Well, it's America.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.045
All your parties are like
that in your commercials.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.254
Oh, all right, that's true.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.673
- Dev.
- Hey, Ravi!

20:15.757 --> 20:17.342
What are you doing here?

20:17.425 --> 20:19.135
One of my investors from
Mumbai Muscle invited me.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.136
Oh, God.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.804
- Hi. Ravi.
- Hi.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.848
CFO and chief dream
ambassador of Mumbai Muscle,

20:23.932 --> 20:25.433
New York's number one desi-owned

20:25.516 --> 20:28.144
organic, non-GMO
chickpea-based protein.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.230
Uh, Francesca. Italian person.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.356
No companies.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.149
Uh. Nice.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.484
She saw you do that.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.610
Huh.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.111
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?

20:37.195 --> 20:38.780
Why are you guys
dressed so cas, man?

20:38.863 --> 20:40.073
I thought this was black tie.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.574
Is this not black tie'?

20:41.658 --> 20:42.909
No. This is a dinner party.

20:42.992 --> 20:43.952
Why would you rent a tux?

20:44.035 --> 20:45.119
Rented? No, I bought this.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.205
This is a wool tux. This
is all they had left.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.790
I look way overdressed.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.166
This guy handed me his
keys on the way in.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.793
I think he thought
I was a valet.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.628
Oh, are you guys bringing
out more hors d'oeuvres?

20:53.711 --> 20:55.296
No, I'm just dressed
in a tux, okay?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.215
- I don't work here.
- My mistake.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.384
I gotta find the guy who
gave me these keys.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.843
You guys let me know
if you hear anyone

21:00.927 --> 21:02.512
talking about owning an Audi Q4.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.806
- All right.
- Okay.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.229
Friends!

21:11.312 --> 21:13.189
Welcome to Jeff's table.

21:13.273 --> 21:18.278
Now, I want to start off
tonight's meal with a question.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.280
Where are we tonight?

21:20.363 --> 21:21.489
Your apartment!

21:21.572 --> 21:22.615
Fuck you, Stewart.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.367
It was rhetorical.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.827
No, we're not in my apartment,

21:25.910 --> 21:29.080
but rather we've
been transported

21:29.163 --> 21:31.624
to the hills of Achando,

21:31.708 --> 21:33.876
deep in the heart
of Basque country.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.962
Now, I just checked
the forecast,

21:36.045 --> 21:38.715
and there is a tornado
of Iberian flavor

21:38.798 --> 21:39.841
headed this way.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.134
So take cover, people.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.761
Thanks for coming, okay? Eat up.

21:43.845 --> 21:44.971
Hey, Dev.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.017
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how are you?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.310
Great to see you.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.561
Thanks for coming. Who's this?

21:51.644 --> 21:53.313
Hi. Francesca. Thanks
for having me.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.440
Hi. Jeff Pastore. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.692
I want you guys to
do me a favor here.

21:57.775 --> 22:01.362
I want you to put this
in your mouths...

22:01.446 --> 22:02.947
Okay.

22:03.031 --> 22:06.034
And tell me the first thing
that comes to your mind.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.453
Mmm.

22:08.536 --> 22:09.537
Deliciousness.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.082
- Ham?
- Wonderful!

22:13.166 --> 22:14.751
All right, you guys have fun.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.918
I'm gonna go play host.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.588
What's up?

22:18.671 --> 22:20.548
What happened to your tuxedo?

22:20.631 --> 22:22.675
Ah, man, I felt a little
self-conscious in it,

22:22.759 --> 22:25.428
so I, uh, took the
shirt and jacket

22:25.511 --> 22:27.472
and I hid it under the bathroom sink.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.349
Could have just put
it in the coat room.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.435
- Fuck! I didn't think about that.
- I have my weed pen.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.062
You guys want to smoke a
little before dinner?

22:34.145 --> 22:35.021
Oh, sure.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.023
Oh, no, man, I gotta lay
off the gas tonight.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.317
I gotta keep my wits about
me for some networking.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.693
Oh.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.236
Check out my new biz cards.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.531
B-b-boom.

22:45.615 --> 22:46.949
Is that shaped like your arm?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.826
Yeah. No.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.412
That's my boy Anush's
real Indian bicep.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.623
- He can curl 150 pounds.
- Hmm.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.542
Do you have a muscle-shaped
wallet I could store it in?

22:56.626 --> 22:58.586
All right, that's enough Ravi time.

22:58.669 --> 22:59.712
Let's go.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.464
- Can I keep it?
- Yeah, please.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.590
My email's on there.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.261
Hey, you guys work out?

23:22.235 --> 23:24.946
Hey, John, why don't you put
that crema catalana down

23:25.029 --> 23:26.739
and play us a tune, man?

23:26.823 --> 23:27.865
Come on. Right?

23:30.618 --> 23:32.203
I guess I gotta sing
for my supper now?

23:32.286 --> 23:33.204
Fuckin' guy.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.373
He wins one Oscar, he thinks
he gets everything for free.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.958
I'm kidding.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.709
I love you. Truth.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.962
All right, yeah.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.339
All right, all right.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.092
I want to dedicate this
song to my good friend

23:46.175 --> 23:48.803
and our host for the
evening, Chef Jeff.

No. Go away.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.851
What about a picture? What's
this party's hashtag?

25:18.935 --> 25:20.228
Put your phone away.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.438
That's cool. Live in the moment.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.523
I like that.

25:33.948 --> 25:34.448
Whoo!

25:36.327 --> 25:38.621
Whoo.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.874
Hey.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.877
What do you think that
guy's doing over there?

25:44.961 --> 25:46.921
It looks like
he's doing yoga.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.466
I think he's just sitting
in a really weird way.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.467
Maybe.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.970
I mean, I don't know. Isn't that
what yoga is, sitting in weird ways?

25:54.053 --> 25:56.556
No, it's not just that.

25:59.976 --> 26:02.186
Merda. I think it's finished.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.813
What's
"merd-ah" mean?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.982
Um, it means "shit."

26:06.065 --> 26:07.316
It's an Italian expression.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.318
We use it to say,
"Shit, it's finished."

26:09.402 --> 26:10.736
Mm.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.946
Can't believe you guys never
taught me the bad words

26:12.029 --> 26:13.406
while I was living in Modena.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.448
You're right.

26:14.532 --> 26:15.491
I think I should
teach you something.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.702
Okay, lesson number one.

26:17.785 --> 26:18.995
Um...

26:19.078 --> 26:20.913
Figlio di puttana.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.582
It means "Son of a whore."

26:22.665 --> 26:24.792
Figlio di puttana.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.712
And there is bruto cornuto.

26:27.795 --> 26:28.713
What does that mean?

26:28.796 --> 26:29.714
That's really bad.

26:29.797 --> 26:30.965
It means "You're ugly,

26:31.048 --> 26:32.842
and your spouse is
cheating on you."

26:32.925 --> 26:34.218
Just those two words?

26:34.302 --> 26:35.803
- Yeah.
- Ooh. When's the last time you said that?

26:35.886 --> 26:37.847
I never say that. It's
really, really bad.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.266
- Hmm.
- I just say...

26:40.349 --> 26:41.392
What does that mean?

26:41.475 --> 26:43.269
It means "Go fuck yourself

26:43.352 --> 26:44.979
and all your dead
family members."

26:45.062 --> 26:47.523
Wow. That's cold.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.151
When I'm mad, I just go, "Hey.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.777
Why you gotta be like that?"

26:51.861 --> 26:52.737
You're evil.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.946
I'm not.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.656
I'm not evil.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.658
Am I evil?

26:57.742 --> 26:59.368
Hmm...

26:59.452 --> 27:00.786
No. I think you're sweet.

27:03.039 --> 27:06.250
I forgot how fun it was
having you around.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.961
I mean, I'm just with Mario
and Nonna in the shop.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.463
It's not the same thing.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.048
Well, he has way better
cheeks than I do.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.341
Come on.

27:13.424 --> 27:14.967
I'm serious.

27:15.051 --> 27:16.844
I missed you.

27:20.473 --> 27:21.891
I'm good. I got my friends here.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.979
- Ah.
- No. I--

27:27.063 --> 27:29.065
I missed you too.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.694
All right, try this wine.
It's amazing.

27:33.778 --> 27:34.820
All right.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.074
Mmm.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.326
Ugh! It tastes like feet.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.410
You're crazy!

27:41.494 --> 27:42.411
Ah, it's disgusting.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.496
Uh, excuse me. Uh...

27:43.579 --> 27:44.413
Mr. Jeff.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.123
Can you take a sip of this wine

27:46.207 --> 27:47.792
and let me know what
you think about it?

27:47.875 --> 27:48.876
Assolutamente.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.044
Grazie.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.005
Ugh. Too barnyard-y.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.048
- Not a fan.
- What?

27:54.131 --> 27:56.217
- You crazy too.
- See?

27:56.300 --> 27:57.968
Gonna grab some of the
wine that doesn't taste

27:58.052 --> 28:00.388
like white, uh, feet
wine, whatever.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.098
Hey, I thought it was good.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.391
I'm gonna have to agree

28:03.474 --> 28:04.892
with your cute
girlfriend over there.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.602
She's not my girlfriend.
Just a friend.

28:06.686 --> 28:07.895
Really?

28:07.978 --> 28:09.105
Are you hoping for more?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.272
No, no, it's not like that.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.108
She's, uh, dating
this guy, Pino.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.109
Pino?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.820
Uh-oh. It's not gonna end
well for you, little D.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.279
What are you talking about?

28:17.363 --> 28:18.447
I can tell. I see the
way you look at her.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.490
- Okay? All night?
- Ah.

28:19.573 --> 28:22.410
Look, you better grab a mitt, 'cause
you're gonna catch some feelings.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.078
Trust me. I've been there, okay?

28:24.161 --> 28:26.247
I'm looking out for you, kid.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.207
I don't want to see that little
heart of yours get broken.

28:35.548 --> 28:38.551
Okay. Quick question for you.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.137
What's the difference between

28:41.220 --> 28:44.640
restroom, bathroom, and toilet?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.267
It's all the same.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.060
Yeah, I get that, but I mean,

28:48.144 --> 28:51.147
if I want to be polite,
what should I use?

28:51.230 --> 28:52.481
Like if you're in a
really nice place?

28:52.565 --> 28:53.858
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

28:53.941 --> 28:56.277
Then you say, "Uh,
excuse me, um,

28:56.360 --> 28:58.070
where's the shitter?"

29:03.367 --> 29:05.035
I don't believe you.

29:05.119 --> 29:06.495
That sounds so rude.

29:13.878 --> 29:17.298
Um, uh, the hotel's right
around the corner, sir.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.508
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.679
What a night.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.432
I still can't believe it.

29:26.515 --> 29:29.310
I mean, New York,

29:29.393 --> 29:32.188
the food was amazing.

29:32.271 --> 29:36.233
And John Legend just played
the piano in a room,

29:36.317 --> 29:38.694
and I was in that room too.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.030
Yeah, you were.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.324
This is insane!

29:43.407 --> 29:45.034
I mean, nobody's
gonna believe me.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.164
Oh.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.541
I had so much fun
with you tonight.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.710
Can we do something
together again?

29:54.794 --> 29:55.669
Yeah.

29:55.753 --> 29:56.712
Do you want to do
something tomorrow?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.130
Yeah!

29:58.214 --> 29:59.548
Oh, no.

29:59.632 --> 30:03.135
Uh, I have to go
somewhere with Pino.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.346
And we actually leave on Sunday,

30:05.429 --> 30:07.264
SO...

30:07.348 --> 30:10.726
I guess next time, right?

30:10.810 --> 30:11.727
Right.

30:13.229 --> 30:14.355
Good night.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.648
Good night.

30:19.735 --> 30:20.820
Buona notte.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.238
Buona notte.

30:36.836 --> 30:39.046
You can go ahead
to the next stop.

33:26.672 --> 33:27.881
Thanks.
