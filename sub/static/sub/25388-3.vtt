00:48.816 --> 00:51.150
Hey. Everything good?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.452
Change is coming, bro. Talking seismic.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.421
Oh, great. You're here.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.887
Come here.

00:56.923 --> 00:58.256
Come here.

01:00.584 --> 01:04.286
Okay. Uh, if you're a client,
which makes you feel safer?

01:04.321 --> 01:06.121
Azure sky or bleaker blue?

01:06.157 --> 01:08.223
Whoa, whoa.
Who said you could redecorate?

01:08.258 --> 01:09.624
You did. You gave me this office.

01:09.660 --> 01:10.859
No, I didn't <i> give</i> you the office.

01:10.895 --> 01:12.227
I said you could <i> use</i> it.

01:12.262 --> 01:14.662
Classic primitive territorial response.

01:14.698 --> 01:16.297
You're feeling threatened.

01:16.332 --> 01:18.166
I'm not threatened.

01:18.201 --> 01:19.533
What? I'm not threatened at all.

01:19.569 --> 01:22.070
I just... I kind of like things
how they are.

01:22.105 --> 01:24.371
You want to play decorator?
Do it somewhere else.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.177
It's... It's not play, Eddie.

01:29.212 --> 01:32.545
It's strategy for our...
our business, our brand.

01:32.581 --> 01:35.148
Okay, you might not care how
things look, but our clients do.

01:35.184 --> 01:36.216
Trust me. You're going to love it.

01:36.251 --> 01:38.318
And if I don't?

01:38.353 --> 01:40.721
Then I'll put it back exactly how it was.

01:40.756 --> 01:41.855
Deal?

01:41.890 --> 01:42.923
Deal.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.693
Oh. I got to get this.

01:48.196 --> 01:49.028
Don't worry.

01:49.063 --> 01:51.363
I have an excellent eye for design.

01:51.398 --> 01:52.798
Clearly.

01:56.229 --> 01:57.703
What? Do they even know
what they're asking?

01:57.739 --> 01:59.811
How dangerous that could be?

02:01.308 --> 02:02.641
Code name: Livorno.

02:03.577 --> 02:05.877
Are you kidding? It's a huge risk.

02:05.912 --> 02:08.179
If this goes wrong,
I could really get hurt.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.881
If people found out...

02:11.218 --> 02:13.752
Okay. We'll talk later. Got to go.

02:13.787 --> 02:14.886
Bye.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.091
Hey, everything all right?

02:20.127 --> 02:21.691
Yeah. Fine.

02:21.727 --> 02:23.393
What was that about on the phone?

02:23.428 --> 02:25.062
Nothing worth repeating.

02:30.069 --> 02:32.035
Hey, Berto.

02:32.071 --> 02:34.905
You ever hear of Codename: Livorno?

02:34.940 --> 02:36.406
Sounds like a Mafia thing. Why?

02:36.441 --> 02:38.307
Sam might be in over her head
on something.

02:38.342 --> 02:39.742
She's acting a little cagey.

02:39.778 --> 02:40.943
Do you want me to investigate?

02:40.979 --> 02:42.145
Discreetly.

02:42.180 --> 02:43.212
Got it.

02:43.248 --> 02:45.882
And, uh, this guy left word.

02:55.025 --> 02:56.124
Hey! Where you going?

02:57.161 --> 02:59.327
Just gonna meet a potential client.

02:59.362 --> 03:00.728
Not without me, you aren't.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.471
Whoa. Is this where our client is?

03:10.507 --> 03:12.273
- At Terra?
- Potential client.

03:12.308 --> 03:14.275
Dude, this used to be my club.

03:14.310 --> 03:16.310
I practically lived here.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.349
There she is.

03:22.384 --> 03:24.418
You walk in, you light up the place.

03:24.453 --> 03:27.855
Ooh. Aram, gosh, I've missed you.

03:27.890 --> 03:29.289
We had some crazy times.

03:29.324 --> 03:31.524
You look wonderful, Sam. Healthy.

03:31.559 --> 03:32.658
And now you're a P.I.

03:32.694 --> 03:35.929
So, with Eddie's well-known
tenacity, hiring the...

03:35.964 --> 03:37.363
It's Mr. Valetik.

03:37.398 --> 03:40.499
And don't assume I'm
going to take this job.

03:40.535 --> 03:42.202
Of course.

03:42.237 --> 03:43.703
I'm getting ahead of myself.

03:43.738 --> 03:46.438
Uh, Eric Fisher is my house deejay.

03:46.473 --> 03:48.207
He didn't come to work
two nights in a row.

03:48.242 --> 03:49.274
No phone calls. Nothing.

03:49.310 --> 03:50.375
Did you call the police?

03:50.410 --> 03:52.044
His roommate, Mark, did, yeah,

03:52.079 --> 03:53.946
but Eric's barely been gone 36 hours,

03:53.981 --> 03:55.948
and the cops aren't moving fast enough.

03:55.983 --> 03:57.169
I need you to find him.

03:57.204 --> 04:01.320
Deejay? What's your real interest in him?

04:01.355 --> 04:02.954
My interest?

04:02.989 --> 04:04.288
He's missing.

04:04.324 --> 04:06.623
And I take care of my people.

04:06.659 --> 04:09.260
Plus, I have a soft spot for the kid.

04:11.331 --> 04:12.629
Can you give us a second?

04:13.111 --> 04:14.198
Me?

04:16.069 --> 04:18.569
You don't have a soft spot for the kid.

04:18.603 --> 04:20.337
You don't have a soft spot, period.

04:20.372 --> 04:21.894
You should go find another P.I.

04:21.930 --> 04:24.007
You know, someone who doesn't
know you as well as I do.

04:24.042 --> 04:26.642
The truth is, Eric is a rock star.

04:26.678 --> 04:28.044
He brought in a hot new crowd

04:28.080 --> 04:29.479
that fills this place every night.

04:29.514 --> 04:31.248
Him being gone is bad for business.

04:31.283 --> 04:33.816
Look, you don't want
to do this for me? Fine.

04:33.852 --> 04:35.385
But the kid's still missing.

04:35.420 --> 04:38.254
He may be in trouble. Do it for him.

04:38.289 --> 04:39.321
If I take this case,

04:39.357 --> 04:41.723
I'm going to follow the leads
wherever they go.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.259
I expect no less.

04:45.296 --> 04:46.695
Eddie, wait.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.530
What was that about?

04:48.565 --> 04:50.366
- What?
- Your little private meeting.

04:50.401 --> 04:53.402
If we want to present a united
front, we can't have secrets.

04:53.437 --> 04:55.336
You're right. I'm sorry.

04:55.372 --> 04:56.704
Who were you on the phone with earlier?

04:58.708 --> 04:59.941
That's what I thought.

04:59.976 --> 05:03.044
Hey, Berto, I need you to do
a work-up on Eric Quinn Fisher.

05:03.079 --> 05:05.046
Date of birth... 10/13/94.

05:05.081 --> 05:07.348
All right. Are you alone?

05:07.384 --> 05:08.249
Yep.

05:08.285 --> 05:09.617
As for Codename: Livorno,

05:09.652 --> 05:10.885
all I'm finding are rumors

05:10.920 --> 05:12.819
about a secret CIA program by that name.

05:14.390 --> 05:16.356
Do you think that's the Codename: Livorno

05:16.392 --> 05:18.392
Sam's mixed up in?

05:18.427 --> 05:22.029
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it has
nothing to do with the CIA.

05:22.064 --> 05:23.063
Monica might know what's up.

05:23.098 --> 05:24.798
Why don't you see what
you can get out of her?

05:24.833 --> 05:26.366
What?

05:26.402 --> 05:28.200
No. I freeze whenever I talk to her.

05:28.236 --> 05:30.102
Besides, she'll see right through me.

05:30.138 --> 05:31.470
I thought you wanted to be a detective.

05:31.505 --> 05:34.073
Invite her out to coffee.
Figure it out, okay?

05:42.183 --> 05:43.282
What?

05:43.318 --> 05:44.817
Why were you so cold to Aram?

05:44.852 --> 05:46.051
Look, to you he might be

05:46.086 --> 05:47.885
your friendly neighborhood club owner,

05:47.921 --> 05:50.422
but I know him as a major player
in organized crime.

05:50.457 --> 05:54.059
What? Aram is...
is your cool, fun mobster,

05:54.094 --> 05:56.061
not "kill you,
bury you in cement" mobster.

05:56.096 --> 05:58.496
You'd be surprised what kind
of mobster he can be.

05:58.531 --> 06:00.231
It's personal between
the two of you, huh?

06:00.267 --> 06:01.299
What's that about?

06:01.335 --> 06:03.167
Nothing worth repeating.

06:03.202 --> 06:05.469
Okay. Fine. I can respect that.

06:05.504 --> 06:07.804
Mm-hmm. Now let's go talk
to Eric's roommate.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.692
I needed a roommate. Eric answered my ad.

06:29.727 --> 06:30.926
We kind of hit it off.

06:30.962 --> 06:34.030
The next thing, his deejay gig
at the club totally blew up.

06:34.065 --> 06:36.031
Was anything strange
going on in Eric's life?

06:36.066 --> 06:37.399
Any problems?

06:39.569 --> 06:40.768
Not as far as I know.

06:40.804 --> 06:42.304
Who'd he run with at the club, Mark?

06:42.339 --> 06:43.372
Anyone dangerous?

06:43.407 --> 06:44.639
Not exactly.

06:44.674 --> 06:47.509
But he did get into this bizarre
thing with a woman last week.

06:47.544 --> 06:48.601
- What woman?
- What bizarre thing?

06:48.637 --> 06:50.645
He said he met her at the Galaxy Lounge.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.547
Next thing, he wakes up in his car

06:52.582 --> 06:54.015
with no clue how he got there.

06:54.050 --> 06:55.383
He figures she spiked his soda.

06:55.418 --> 06:57.118
Well, maybe he just had a few too many.

06:57.153 --> 06:59.620
Eric doesn't drink or do drugs.

06:59.655 --> 07:04.325
Plus, when he woke up,
he had needle marks on his arm.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.293
She injected him with something.

07:06.329 --> 07:08.269
Whatever she did, it freaked him out.

07:08.304 --> 07:11.464
After that, he started saying
someone was following him.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.900
I thought he was just
being paranoid, but now...

07:13.935 --> 07:16.069
This woman. We need her name.

07:16.104 --> 07:17.570
He never got her name.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.507
He just said she was a redhead, sexy,

07:20.542 --> 07:22.842
with a ladybug tattoo on her shoulder.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.746
So, I ran background on Eric.

07:26.781 --> 07:28.880
The guy's got no criminal
records, no money issues,

07:28.916 --> 07:29.902
nothing hanging out there

07:29.937 --> 07:31.383
that would explain why he went missing.

07:31.419 --> 07:33.052
What about the girl
with the ladybug tattoo?

07:33.087 --> 07:35.254
I did better with her.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.490
Bartender at the Galaxy knew who she was.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.597
Megan Murphy.

07:39.632 --> 07:41.527
She's a stripper dressed as a nurse?

07:41.562 --> 07:43.929
She's a real nurse,
or at least she was anyway.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.663
She get fired from St. Joe's
three months back

07:45.698 --> 07:47.031
for stealing drugs.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.199
Where is she now?

07:48.234 --> 07:50.401
That's what's weird. Right
after Eric Fisher vanished,

07:50.437 --> 07:51.902
Megan went off the grid.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.238
No cellphone activity, no credit card,

07:54.274 --> 07:55.906
but then yesterday, she got pulled over

07:55.942 --> 07:57.508
doing 90 on the 10 near Upland.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.610
Sounds like Megan's involved
in Eric's disappearance,

07:59.645 --> 08:00.878
and now she's on the run.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.011
But going where?

08:02.047 --> 08:04.013
Nothing's popped up on her
since her ticket in Upland.

08:04.049 --> 08:05.382
Well, where did these pictures come from?

08:05.417 --> 08:07.451
Um, I hacked into her cloud.

08:07.486 --> 08:10.019
Tried to see if she took any
recent pictures, but no luck.

08:10.055 --> 08:11.288
These are from months ago.

08:11.323 --> 08:13.690
Wait, where do you think that cabin is?

08:13.725 --> 08:15.858
Lake Arrowhead, maybe. Big Bear.

08:15.894 --> 08:18.594
Geotag says definitely Big Bear.

08:18.629 --> 08:20.929
Well, a cabin would be
a great place to lay low.

08:20.965 --> 08:23.065
Upland's on the way to Big Bear.

08:23.101 --> 08:25.468
Ooh, road trip.
We should get some snacks.

08:25.503 --> 08:27.069
No, we don't need snacks.

08:30.674 --> 08:33.741
- Ask her to coffee.
- Livorno.

08:33.777 --> 08:34.577
No.

08:34.611 --> 08:35.610
Go on.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.587
I got this.

08:45.622 --> 08:48.590
I am a confident and together dude.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.592
Hey, confident and together dude.

08:50.627 --> 08:53.427
Want to grab a coffee,
get to know each other better?

08:53.462 --> 08:54.661
I, uh...

08:54.696 --> 08:56.163
Cool. Let's go.

09:05.407 --> 09:07.608
Well, this is definitely the place.

09:07.643 --> 09:08.642
Wait here.

09:40.374 --> 09:42.541
Wow. That actually worked!

09:47.803 --> 09:50.737
Are you always this nervous around girls?

09:50.772 --> 09:52.072
I'm not nervous.

09:52.107 --> 09:53.039
Right.

09:53.075 --> 09:56.943
So, how long have you
been working with Eddie?

09:56.979 --> 09:59.337
Well, he busted me when he was a
cop, mentored me through juvie,

09:59.372 --> 10:01.914
made sure I finished high
school, then put me to work.

10:01.949 --> 10:05.317
You two go back.
I bet you know all his secrets.

10:05.352 --> 10:07.953
Some, like you must know Sam's.

10:07.989 --> 10:10.322
Hey, she took a weird phone call
this morning.

10:10.357 --> 10:11.423
What was that about?

10:11.458 --> 10:12.457
No idea.

10:12.493 --> 10:14.392
So, what's the deal with Eddie
and this Aram guy?

10:14.428 --> 10:15.827
Seems like they have history.

10:15.862 --> 10:17.506
No idea. Hey, listen.

10:17.541 --> 10:19.772
Sam was talking about something
called Codename: Livorno.

10:19.807 --> 10:21.198
Sounded dangerous.

10:21.234 --> 10:24.235
You think maybe Eddie
arrested him back in the day?

10:24.270 --> 10:26.192
- Who?
- Aram Nazarian.

10:26.873 --> 10:28.640
I was talking about Sam's phone call.

10:30.944 --> 10:32.976
You're interrogating me.

10:33.012 --> 10:34.678
What?

10:34.713 --> 10:36.579
Eddie told you to work me for information

10:36.615 --> 10:37.648
about Sam's phone call.

10:37.683 --> 10:40.383
No, that...

10:43.321 --> 10:44.921
Hey, did Sam ask you...

10:46.859 --> 10:49.259
You lured me here under false pretenses.

10:49.294 --> 10:51.827
And you accepted under false pretenses.

10:51.863 --> 10:53.829
I guess that makes us even. See ya.

11:01.039 --> 11:04.373
Can we, like...
Can we work something out?

11:04.408 --> 11:07.341
Like, just tell whoever sent you
that I won't be a problem.

11:07.377 --> 11:08.943
We're not going to hurt you, Megan.

11:08.979 --> 11:10.645
We just want to know about Eric Fisher.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.214
Where is he? What happened to him?

11:13.249 --> 11:14.812
Let's start with something easy.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.885
Why did you spike Eric's drink?

11:16.920 --> 11:20.055
I was paid to... $1,000.

11:20.090 --> 11:21.289
Who hired you?

11:21.324 --> 11:24.291
Just a voice on the other side
of the phone.

11:24.326 --> 11:26.250
They knew that I was
a banana-bag girl, though.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.360
A what?

11:27.396 --> 11:30.864
Banana bags. They're IV bags
with saline, electrolytes.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.901
Your elite party animals hire
nurses to hook them up to an IV,

11:33.936 --> 11:35.703
and then, voilà, no hangover.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.571
I may have used the service on occasion

11:37.606 --> 11:39.539
to feel a little more perky the next day.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.473
So, why would you drug Eric at the bar

11:41.509 --> 11:42.709
and then give him an IV?

11:42.744 --> 11:44.479
I didn't give him an IV.

11:45.113 --> 11:48.047
They had me take his blood. Two vials.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.215
His blood? For what?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.216
I didn't ask any questions.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.351
I just put the vials in his car,
like I was told.

11:52.386 --> 11:54.854
Then the next thing I know,
he went missing,

11:54.889 --> 11:57.090
and then these guys started following me.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.410
One of them tried to shove me
in the back of a van.

11:59.446 --> 12:00.892
And you thought that we were with them?

12:00.928 --> 12:03.095
What was I supposed to think?
You knocked me off my bike.

12:03.130 --> 12:05.197
Sorry. Got a little carried away.

12:05.232 --> 12:07.032
This guy who grabbed you, you
remember what he looked like?

12:08.103 --> 12:09.500
Where did it happen?

12:09.536 --> 12:11.536
Um, the parking garage at the Numi.

12:11.571 --> 12:14.706
I know that hotel. They have cameras.

12:17.977 --> 12:20.044
You know what's going on here, right?

12:20.079 --> 12:22.299
If I knew what was going on,
we wouldn't be investigating.

12:22.335 --> 12:25.950
I have three words for you...
black market organ-harvesting.

12:25.985 --> 12:28.252
All right, maybe that's four
words, but think about it.

12:28.287 --> 12:30.354
Eric was young.
He didn't drink or do drugs.

12:30.389 --> 12:32.622
He was the perfect donor,
so they took his blood

12:32.657 --> 12:34.190
because they needed his blood type

12:34.226 --> 12:36.192
so they could match his organs
to a buyer.

12:36.228 --> 12:37.670
That's actually a solid theory.

12:37.705 --> 12:38.661
You really think so?

12:38.696 --> 12:40.230
It sure worked on "Hot Suspect."

12:40.265 --> 12:41.965
What was the name of that episode?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.133
"The Organist"?

12:43.168 --> 12:44.868
Okay, fine, so maybe my theory

12:44.903 --> 12:47.436
was a little bit inspired by
the show, but it still fits.

12:47.472 --> 12:50.139
The organ ring probably
stripped Eric of spare parts,

12:50.174 --> 12:52.741
leaving him an empty,
lifeless shell of a man.

12:52.777 --> 12:54.943
It is great that you cracked
the case and everything,

12:54.979 --> 12:57.246
but I think we still need to see
who tried to grabbed Megan.

12:57.281 --> 12:58.947
What, you think that the hotel's

12:58.983 --> 13:01.116
really going to show you
their surveillance video?

13:01.152 --> 13:02.785
They will with this.

13:02.820 --> 13:04.119
Hey, where's my badge?

13:04.155 --> 13:05.154
I don't have one for you.

13:05.189 --> 13:06.476
But I need a badge.

13:06.511 --> 13:08.656
The right props really ground
my performance.

13:08.691 --> 13:10.604
There's no performance going on here.
You're not acting.

13:10.639 --> 13:13.060
We're playing DHS agents,
so we kind of are acting.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.662
<i>I'm</i> playing a DHS agent.

13:14.697 --> 13:16.730
Please... just stay here.

13:25.007 --> 13:26.273
How can I help you?

13:26.308 --> 13:27.573
Walter Faraday, DHS.

13:27.609 --> 13:30.177
I need to look at security video from P3.

13:30.212 --> 13:31.477
It's part of an ongoing investigation.

13:31.513 --> 13:33.180
Here's the date and time.

13:33.215 --> 13:34.895
Happy to assist. You have a warrant?

13:34.931 --> 13:36.049
It's a national security matter.

13:36.084 --> 13:37.750
Clock's ticking, so I appreciate it if...

13:37.786 --> 13:39.352
Sir, we're still gonna have to
do this by the book.

13:39.387 --> 13:41.753
Is there a problem here?

13:41.789 --> 13:43.689
- I can handle this.
- Can you?

13:43.724 --> 13:46.158
Special Agent Kimmy Monroe, DHS.

13:46.194 --> 13:47.394
Officer Dennis Parks?

13:47.430 --> 13:49.594
My subordinate asked to view some video.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.030
I advise you to honor that request.

13:51.065 --> 13:52.497
But, as I said, I just need
a warrant to make...

13:52.533 --> 13:54.266
Are you familiar with the work
we do at DHS?

13:54.302 --> 13:56.101
How we protect this great nation
and its people

13:56.137 --> 13:57.668
from threats against the homeland?

13:57.704 --> 13:59.670
- I'm absolutely aware of the work...
- Don't interrupt.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.539
We expect resistance from terrorists

14:01.574 --> 14:04.108
and misguided citizens
who are all hot and bothered

14:04.144 --> 14:05.485
about their constitutional rights,

14:05.521 --> 14:07.132
but when a law-enforcement
colleague like yourself

14:07.167 --> 14:08.291
doesn't cooperate,

14:08.326 --> 14:11.382
we have a very special place
for that person, Dennis Parks.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.984
What's your middle name
and date of birth?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.885
Alan, 2/9/86.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.169
Wait, why do you need that information?

14:16.204 --> 14:17.888
Because we're putting you on the list.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.054
What... What list?

14:19.089 --> 14:20.423
<i>The</i> list.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.775
Not that you'll ever be able
to prove there is such a thing,

14:22.810 --> 14:25.562
but all of a sudden,
your credit score drops.

14:25.597 --> 14:27.530
Your son doesn't make
the Little League team.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.033
And every time you board
a plane, you're strip-searched.

14:30.069 --> 14:31.000
But that's just for starters,

14:31.035 --> 14:34.170
'cause once you're on the list,
it's forever.

14:34.205 --> 14:35.891
Is that the kind of life
you want, Dennis?

14:35.926 --> 14:37.173
- Is it?
- No.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.141
Then cue up that video
and give us the room.

14:39.177 --> 14:40.309
Okay.

14:45.116 --> 14:46.048
I had it handled.

14:46.084 --> 14:47.149
You're welcome.

14:47.185 --> 14:48.449
Though I got a little big.

14:48.485 --> 14:51.552
You know,<i> playing</i> DHS
instead of <i> being</i> DHS.

14:51.588 --> 14:52.553
I needed that badge.

14:52.589 --> 14:54.155
If I had the badge,
I would have killed it.

14:54.191 --> 14:55.202
Ah, okay.

14:55.238 --> 14:57.058
There she is.

14:57.094 --> 14:58.256
That's Megan.

15:00.630 --> 15:03.831
And the guy tried to grab her,
just like she said.

15:05.301 --> 15:07.368
Wait. I've seen him before.

15:08.871 --> 15:11.605
That's the doorman from Aram's club.

15:11.633 --> 15:14.086
I should have known. Aram's behind this.

15:14.086 --> 15:16.687
If Aram made Eric disappear, why
would he hire us to find him?

15:16.722 --> 15:20.323
Maybe he wanted us to find <i> Megan</i>
because she's a loose end.

15:20.358 --> 15:23.125
You think you know this guy,
but trust me, you don't.

15:23.161 --> 15:25.460
You know Aram begged me to go to rehab?

15:25.496 --> 15:27.830
Not that I listened,
but he was one of the few people

15:27.865 --> 15:30.299
who saw I was in trouble and
tried to do something about it.

15:30.334 --> 15:32.467
I'm sure he donates to charity, too.

15:32.503 --> 15:34.804
But he's pulling the strings here, Sam.

15:34.839 --> 15:37.006
He's after Megan, and I can prove it.

15:45.448 --> 15:47.982
Mr. Valetik, Sam, is there news?

15:48.018 --> 15:50.185
Not on Eric's whereabouts,
but we found a woman

15:50.220 --> 15:52.220
who was paid to drug him
and take his blood.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.222
Where is she? I need to speak to her.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.190
That's funny.
You didn't even ask her name.

15:56.225 --> 15:57.749
Oh, right,

15:57.784 --> 15:59.292
because you know who she is

15:59.328 --> 16:01.195
because you had your bouncer
over there try to grab her.

16:03.232 --> 16:06.100
You idiot! You get caught on video?!

16:06.135 --> 16:07.067
I can explain that to you.

16:07.103 --> 16:08.869
Get out!

16:09.872 --> 16:11.371
What did you do, Aram?

16:11.406 --> 16:13.572
Whatever it is, I want no part of it.

16:13.608 --> 16:16.442
I need to talk to Megan Murphy.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.319
I'll double your fee. I'll triple it!

16:18.354 --> 16:20.947
In what universe do you think
that I could be bought?

16:20.982 --> 16:23.182
I told you I'd follow this
evidence wherever it went.

16:23.218 --> 16:25.451
Now I'm going to take it
to the U.S. Attorney's office,

16:25.486 --> 16:28.020
so good luck trying
to beat the rap this time.

16:28.056 --> 16:29.154
Hey, wait!

16:29.189 --> 16:32.183
Valetik, it's not what you think.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.960
This was sent to me 10 minutes ago.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.262
That's Eric Fisher.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.297
<i>You will pay $1 million</i>

16:39.332 --> 16:41.633
<i>or you'll never see your son again.</i>

16:41.668 --> 16:44.236
<i>I'll contact you with details.</i>

16:44.271 --> 16:46.072
Eric is your son?

16:47.748 --> 16:49.917
I was a kid. I got a girl pregnant.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.741
I gave her everything she needed,

16:51.777 --> 16:53.777
but I made her swear
not to tell Eric about me.

16:54.293 --> 16:56.127
I didn't want this life to touch him.

16:56.152 --> 16:58.052
I kept tabs on him from afar,

16:58.087 --> 17:00.121
and then we were auditioning deejays,

17:00.156 --> 17:02.990
and Eric just walked in out of the blue.

17:03.026 --> 17:05.092
He had talent, so I hired him.

17:05.127 --> 17:06.961
He rocked the house,

17:06.996 --> 17:09.769
and I got to be around my son
without anyone knowing.

17:09.804 --> 17:11.396
Who else knows that he's your son?

17:11.432 --> 17:13.098
I didn't think anyone did,

17:13.135 --> 17:15.601
but the second he was gone,
I was afraid...

17:15.637 --> 17:18.709
afraid he'd been taken by
one of my enemies to weaken me.

17:18.743 --> 17:21.406
This is a kidnapping.
You should call the FBI.

17:21.442 --> 17:22.909
And bring the Feds into my life?

17:22.944 --> 17:24.343
Is that what you'd do if you were me?

17:24.378 --> 17:26.912
- I wouldn't be you.
- Please, Valetik.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.233
Please, don't make Eric

17:28.270 --> 17:30.849
pay for the sins of a father
he doesn't even know.

17:30.885 --> 17:32.051
Help me.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.190
We'll set traces on your phone

17:38.225 --> 17:40.192
and comb the messages
and photos for clues.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.494
In the meantime, you should
start working on that cash.

17:42.529 --> 17:43.527
That won't be a problem.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.129
You said that it was
your enemies who did this.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.397
Which enemies?

17:46.432 --> 17:49.500
Could be any number of them, but
I'm guessing it's Oleg Basarov.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.468
Russian mob? Why Oleg?

17:51.504 --> 17:52.503
We've had our problems.

17:52.538 --> 17:55.106
It's worse now since you two
put Deacon in jail.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.709
Oleg and I are competing
for some of Deacon's territory.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.897
It would be pure Oleg
to kidnap Eric to leverage me.

18:01.847 --> 18:05.215
But... I can't say for sure it's him.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.317
Well, maybe there's a way we can be sure.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.885
How?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.354
Set a meeting... just you and Oleg.

18:11.389 --> 18:12.522
Then come to my office.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.860
If Oleg took Eric, we could
get a third party involved,

18:17.895 --> 18:19.729
maybe resolve this before it gets ugly.

18:19.764 --> 18:21.463
How? Oleg doesn't sound
like the type of guy

18:21.498 --> 18:22.698
who's just going to fess up.

18:22.734 --> 18:23.632
That's why we need Zeus.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.334
He's got some toys
that may help with Oleg.

18:25.369 --> 18:27.632
Oh, I'll catch you later.

18:28.339 --> 18:30.134
Got a meeting?

18:31.275 --> 18:32.307
Want to share?

18:32.343 --> 18:34.709
Mm, want to share what's
going on with you and Aram?

18:34.745 --> 18:37.311
Nice try. I'll catch you later.

18:37.347 --> 18:39.748
<i>You will pay $1 million.</i>

18:41.785 --> 18:43.852
<i>We'll contact you with details.</i>

18:43.887 --> 18:45.220
What are you working on?

18:45.255 --> 18:46.454
<i>You will pay $1 million.</i>

18:46.489 --> 18:48.132
- Yeah, I'm not falling for that.
<i>- You will never see your...</i>

18:48.168 --> 18:50.191
Like you weren't doing
the same thing to me.

18:50.227 --> 18:51.992
Come on. I'm just curious.

18:52.027 --> 18:53.908
<i>You will pay $1 million.</i>

18:54.964 --> 18:56.496
All I got off Eric's proof-of-life photo

18:56.531 --> 18:58.662
is that it was taken
from an Alcavox cellphone.

18:58.697 --> 19:00.234
Now I'm trying to dig out
the caller's real voice,

19:00.269 --> 19:02.602
and so far I'm not sure
if it's male or female.

19:02.638 --> 19:05.105
But you have the words, the behavior.

19:05.141 --> 19:06.373
What does that get me?

19:06.408 --> 19:07.907
A possible psych profile.

19:07.942 --> 19:10.509
And as it happens,
I took a profiling seminar.

19:10.544 --> 19:13.045
Consider... the unknown subject,
or unsub,

19:13.081 --> 19:15.181
waited two days before calling Aram.

19:15.216 --> 19:16.548
And listen to that message.

19:16.584 --> 19:19.318
Usually it's, "We've got so-and-so.
Give us money."

19:19.353 --> 19:20.988
But our unsub leads with money,

19:21.024 --> 19:23.355
then goes to, "We have your son."

19:23.391 --> 19:24.723
Why?

19:24.759 --> 19:26.357
Aren't you supposed to tell me?

19:26.393 --> 19:29.394
"We have your son" was meant
as a gut punch for Aram.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.730
That's how I know our unsub's
motives are deeply personal.

19:32.766 --> 19:35.300
What else can you tell me
about the unsub?

19:38.238 --> 19:40.205
Livorno.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.472
Can you give me more details?

19:41.508 --> 19:43.140
Because right now it sounds like

19:43.176 --> 19:44.741
it could be dangerous for my career.

19:44.777 --> 19:47.477
Before you even think
of turning this down,

19:47.513 --> 19:49.422
take a look at their offer.

19:50.316 --> 19:52.283
What? Whoa.

19:52.318 --> 19:54.885
Right? Plus, it's an opportunity.

19:54.921 --> 19:56.753
It's a chance to show
everyone in this town

19:56.789 --> 19:58.622
that you can show up
and be a professional.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.423
So what is the role, exactly?

20:04.429 --> 20:06.395
This is what they want me to do?

20:06.431 --> 20:08.631
No, no. I can't, I can't. Syd, come on.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.633
I mean, I still have <i> some</i> dignity.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.570
This is the part where you're supposed
to say, "Yeah, no, Sam, you do."

20:14.605 --> 20:15.838
This is real money, Sam.

20:15.873 --> 20:17.973
It's not going to be shown in the States,

20:18.008 --> 20:19.975
and it's not dinner theater or porn.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.143
Porn would be a step up.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.410
Sam.

20:22.446 --> 20:24.623
I have to get back to the office.

20:26.116 --> 20:27.415
Oh.

20:29.887 --> 20:31.786
Well, you think this will really work?

20:31.822 --> 20:34.455
We're talking state-of-the-art
lie detection, brother.

20:34.490 --> 20:36.623
But a whole lot depends on Aram.

20:36.659 --> 20:40.222
Must be tough, seeing that guy
running loose in the world.

20:41.231 --> 20:43.164
It is what it is.

20:46.702 --> 20:48.769
Doing some remodeling?

20:48.804 --> 20:49.903
She covered the windows

20:49.938 --> 20:51.504
so she can't see what
she's doing to the room, huh?

20:51.539 --> 20:53.773
Wait. You're having her move in.

20:53.808 --> 20:55.108
You, of all people?

20:55.143 --> 20:57.844
What am I supposed to do?
She <i> is</i> working with me, right?

20:57.880 --> 20:59.846
You put her name on the door,
the whole shebang.

20:59.882 --> 21:01.781
No. Th-That wasn't me.

21:01.816 --> 21:03.449
I-I did not sign off on that.

21:03.485 --> 21:05.136
I don't see you taking it down, either.

21:05.171 --> 21:06.319
Sure makes a man wonder.

21:06.355 --> 21:08.320
There's nothing to wonder about,
all right?

21:08.356 --> 21:11.390
Nothing.

21:16.597 --> 21:19.498
I meet Oleg in one hour
on a pier in San Pedro.

21:19.533 --> 21:20.832
Then let's get to it.

21:20.868 --> 21:23.002
This is a speaker and a microphone.

21:23.037 --> 21:24.035
Get it in there good.

21:24.070 --> 21:26.504
You're also gonna be on-camera.
So will Oleg.

21:26.539 --> 21:28.760
- The camera can tell if he's lying?
- Mine can.

21:28.795 --> 21:32.010
They pick up heart rate, B.P.,
body temperature, voice stress.

21:32.045 --> 21:34.045
What we have here is a remote polygraph,

21:34.080 --> 21:36.547
but I need a few "yes" or "no"
control questions

21:36.582 --> 21:38.316
to get a baseline reading on Oleg.

21:38.351 --> 21:39.750
He's not exactly one for small talk.

21:39.786 --> 21:41.470
That's why you're just
going to stick to a script.

21:41.505 --> 21:43.319
Just start with,
"Thank you for coming, Oleg.

21:43.355 --> 21:45.389
How's your family?
Can I offer you a cigar?"

21:45.424 --> 21:46.553
And then we go deep.

21:46.589 --> 21:48.191
"Are you familiar with my nightclub?

21:48.227 --> 21:50.660
Have you heard of Eric Fisher?
Do you know where he is now?"

21:50.695 --> 21:51.828
But here's the thing.

21:51.863 --> 21:52.963
You have to stay calm

21:52.998 --> 21:55.565
so Oleg is reacting to
the questions and not to you.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.700
How can I be calm? He has my son!

21:57.736 --> 22:00.182
Okay, Aram, I learned
this great breathing technique

22:00.217 --> 22:02.538
in acting class that settles your nerves.

22:02.573 --> 22:05.074
You push your right nostril
closed, and you inhale slowly.

22:06.110 --> 22:07.910
Then you push on the left,
and you let it out.

22:07.946 --> 22:09.245
You do it.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.246
There you go.

22:11.549 --> 22:14.550
Yeah, just like that. Try it again.

22:24.061 --> 22:25.827
You're doing great, Aram.

22:27.564 --> 22:28.696
That's him.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.632
Oleg's here. Showtime.

22:31.668 --> 22:33.567
Hey, that's probably not going to help.

22:39.141 --> 22:40.774
<i>Oleg.</i>

22:40.809 --> 22:42.276
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

22:42.311 --> 22:44.611
Remember the script. Offer him a cigar.

22:44.646 --> 22:46.146
<i>Can I offer you a cigar?</i>

22:46.182 --> 22:47.581
See? Aram's holding it together.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.482
That breathing thing works every time.

22:49.517 --> 22:52.952
<i>I smoke a cigar with the man
who burned down my building?</i>

22:52.988 --> 22:55.654
<i>Actually, it was</i> my <i> building,</i>

22:55.690 --> 22:57.256
<i>which you stole using a fake title.</i>

22:57.292 --> 22:59.658
<i>- This is a lie.</i>
- Pulse and B.P. heading north.

22:59.694 --> 23:02.295
I can't get a good read
if Oleg's all upset.

23:02.330 --> 23:04.797
Aram, quit arguing. Stay on script.

23:04.832 --> 23:06.931
We'll deal with the building.

23:06.967 --> 23:09.134
I'm here about my nightclub.

23:09.169 --> 23:12.604
Such a bad name for a club.

23:12.639 --> 23:13.671
Terra?

23:13.707 --> 23:15.407
It's like "terrible".

23:15.442 --> 23:16.941
- Uh-oh.
<i>- Not high class, your club.</i>

23:16.977 --> 23:18.443
Aram, he's trying to provoke you.

23:18.479 --> 23:19.444
- Don't take the bait.
<i>- And the deejay...</i>

23:19.480 --> 23:22.481
Aram, just breathe,
just like I showed you.

23:22.516 --> 23:24.681
An attack to the ears.

23:24.717 --> 23:27.118
You ask me, they should close the place.

23:27.153 --> 23:29.420
Why are you breathing this way?

23:29.455 --> 23:31.088
What man does this?

23:31.124 --> 23:33.270
Eric Fisher.

23:34.227 --> 23:35.459
Where is he?

23:35.495 --> 23:37.128
I don't know what you mean, Aram.

23:37.163 --> 23:38.429
Where is he?!

23:38.464 --> 23:39.696
We're done.

23:47.639 --> 23:48.971
Does he have Eric?

23:49.755 --> 23:50.840
Does he?!

23:50.875 --> 23:53.676
With a hot mess like that,
it's hard to tell,

23:53.711 --> 23:55.811
but he didn't react
to Eric's name at all,

23:55.847 --> 23:59.281
so Oleg is either the world's
best liar or it's not him.

24:01.685 --> 24:03.318
That's your phone, Aram.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.686
The kidnapper?

24:04.721 --> 24:05.921
Hello?

24:05.956 --> 24:08.157
<i> We will text an address in one hour.</i>

24:08.192 --> 24:11.126
<i>The ransom is to be delivered
by a neutral third party.</i>

24:11.162 --> 24:13.695
<i>We choose Samantha Swift.</i>

24:17.810 --> 24:19.459
So, how does this work?

24:19.484 --> 24:21.535
Do I meet someone, or do
I just drop the bag somewhere?

24:21.560 --> 24:22.593
Neither. You're not doing this.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.595
We don't have enough time
to prep a ransom drop.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.229
Then we'll do the best we can.

24:26.264 --> 24:27.563
They specifically wanted <i> you.</i>

24:27.599 --> 24:29.299
That means they've been watching us.

24:29.334 --> 24:31.801
Please, Sam, do as they ask.
They'll bring back my boy.

24:31.836 --> 24:32.735
We don't know that!

24:32.770 --> 24:35.372
They may be using this drop to
kidnap her. It's too risky.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.973
All right, you guys, just stop, okay?

24:37.009 --> 24:38.241
This is my call.

24:38.276 --> 24:39.476
Me delivering the money

24:39.511 --> 24:41.577
is our best chance of getting Eric back.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.424
So what do I do next?

24:44.883 --> 24:46.448
Hold still for a sec.

24:46.484 --> 24:50.185
Is that a brooch?
I don't really do brooches.

24:50.221 --> 24:51.620
You're going to want to do this one.

24:51.655 --> 24:53.122
It's going to be our eyes
and ears out there.

24:54.525 --> 24:55.690
Ouch.

24:55.726 --> 24:57.993
Good thing they didn't use
that kind of camera on my show.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.232
The level of detail is brutal.

25:00.863 --> 25:02.296
Sorry.

25:02.332 --> 25:04.698
Hey, I earned this face, hm?

25:04.734 --> 25:06.780
Now give me a "Testing, one, two."

25:07.970 --> 25:09.437
Zeus?

25:09.472 --> 25:10.938
What's up with Aram and Eddie?

25:10.973 --> 25:12.173
Gonna have to ask Eddie.

25:12.208 --> 25:14.375
- He won't tell me.
- He will when he's ready.

25:14.411 --> 25:15.709
I'll be retired by then.

25:15.745 --> 25:19.379
Besides, am I not about to do a
ransom drop to free Aram's son?

25:19.415 --> 25:22.649
I feel like I've earned the
right to know what's going on.

25:24.719 --> 25:28.988
When Eddie was on the force, he
tripped onto a gang of bad cops.

25:29.024 --> 25:31.224
They called themselves Unit 23.

25:31.260 --> 25:34.593
They framed suspects,
stole drug money, even worse.

25:34.628 --> 25:36.529
But what they didn't realize is,

25:36.564 --> 25:38.531
Eddie always does the right thing.

25:38.566 --> 25:42.900
Now, Eddie loved being a cop,
and he was as good as they get.

25:43.404 --> 25:45.704
He knew that if he blew
the whistle on Unit 23,

25:45.739 --> 25:47.573
it would cost him, and it did.

25:47.608 --> 25:48.858
LAPD pushed him out.

25:48.894 --> 25:51.076
Cases made by those cops got dropped,

25:51.111 --> 25:55.547
and a lot of bad guys
got cut loose... like Aram.

25:55.582 --> 25:59.500
So when Eddie sees Aram, it just
brings that whole mess back.

26:00.387 --> 26:01.919
That's it.

26:02.789 --> 26:05.690
He'd do it all again. It's who he is.

26:08.760 --> 26:09.893
Hey.

26:09.928 --> 26:11.390
You doing all right?

26:11.425 --> 26:12.963
Never better.

26:12.998 --> 26:14.965
All right. They just texted a location.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.601
The drop is at the corner
of 6th and Spring.

26:37.755 --> 26:40.189
I'm on 6th and Spring. Now what?

26:42.759 --> 26:44.692
Just, uh, sit tight. We got you.

26:48.098 --> 26:50.999
Whoa. Who wants to meet me in Vegas?

26:51.034 --> 26:52.634
Just kidding.

26:58.642 --> 26:59.806
Okay. Who is this guy?

26:59.842 --> 27:00.841
He just give her a phone?

27:00.876 --> 27:02.176
Sam, what's going on?

27:02.211 --> 27:03.944
Hello?

27:03.979 --> 27:05.556
<i>Do exactly as I say.</i>

27:05.591 --> 27:07.322
<i>Do not speak, or Eric dies.</i>

27:07.358 --> 27:09.194
<i>I know they're listening.</i>

27:09.885 --> 27:13.420
<i>Go down the street, enter
the building on the left,</i>

27:13.456 --> 27:14.955
<i>go into the lobby.</i>

27:18.693 --> 27:21.528
Sam, who's talking to you?
What are they saying?

27:21.563 --> 27:23.129
Sam?

27:23.165 --> 27:25.632
Give us a thumbs-down
if you want us to pull you out.

27:32.907 --> 27:34.806
The drop must be inside somewhere.

27:34.841 --> 27:37.176
Narek, move into position
and surround the building.

27:37.211 --> 27:38.724
Nobody leaves.

27:39.413 --> 27:41.112
<i>Get in the elevator.</i>

27:41.148 --> 27:42.847
<i>Go to the sixth floor.</i>

27:54.694 --> 27:56.026
What button was that? Which floor?

27:56.062 --> 27:57.695
Her hand was out of the shot.

28:02.268 --> 28:03.867
- Zeus.
- Lost the signal.

28:03.903 --> 28:05.393
It... It's the elevator.

28:05.429 --> 28:06.870
We'll get her as soon as she comes out.

28:06.906 --> 28:08.405
I don't like this.

28:11.876 --> 28:14.143
<i>Go to Room 645.</i>

28:17.683 --> 28:19.182
Where's her signal? Why isn't it back?

28:21.119 --> 28:23.320
It wasn't the elevator.
They're jamming her frequency.

28:31.229 --> 28:32.728
<i>Keep walking.</i>

28:53.950 --> 28:58.485
<i>Go into Room 645 and close the door.</i>

29:14.136 --> 29:15.801
<i>Now move to the window.</i>

29:15.836 --> 29:18.704
<i>Closer. Closer.</i>

29:18.740 --> 29:22.040
Sam! Sam!

29:22.076 --> 29:23.776
Sam!

29:28.750 --> 29:30.676
What happened? Are you okay?

29:30.677 --> 29:33.350
They told me to break the window
and toss out the bag.

29:42.017 --> 29:44.550
Yeah, it's a maroon Pontiac, early 2000s.

29:46.126 --> 29:47.978
All right, great. Just let me know.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.128
Berto's putting word on social media

29:50.163 --> 29:51.195
to see if anyone saw that car.

29:51.231 --> 29:52.997
Why didn't they release Eric?

29:53.032 --> 29:54.754
If we're lucky,
they just wanted more money.

29:54.790 --> 29:56.834
If we're not, he's dead.

29:58.204 --> 30:00.070
Eddie, talk for a second?

30:03.842 --> 30:05.509
I said to seal off the building.

30:05.544 --> 30:06.876
How did that car get away?

30:06.911 --> 30:08.111
Hm? How, Narek?!

30:08.147 --> 30:09.279
It was a mix-up, sir.

30:09.314 --> 30:11.148
I thought we had the alley covered.

30:11.183 --> 30:12.282
I'm sorry.

30:12.317 --> 30:14.116
You're sorry? You're sorry?!

30:14.151 --> 30:15.218
- Whoa.
- Hm?!

30:15.254 --> 30:16.686
Aram, come on.

30:17.756 --> 30:19.121
You.

30:19.157 --> 30:22.224
My one chance to get him back.

30:22.260 --> 30:23.992
And you just gave them the money!

30:26.063 --> 30:27.829
We're going to find the car,

30:27.865 --> 30:29.624
so why don't you just go back to the club

30:29.659 --> 30:31.233
and wait for my phone call?

30:31.269 --> 30:34.637
And if you pull a move like that
again, you're a dead man.

30:34.672 --> 30:35.970
Understand?

30:41.110 --> 30:44.646
The look in his eyes...
like a wild animal.

30:44.681 --> 30:45.846
I couldn't even move.

30:45.882 --> 30:48.149
I should have got you out
of there before he showed up.

30:48.185 --> 30:51.018
Why'd you even take this job,
knowing what he is?

30:51.054 --> 30:53.669
'Cause it wasn't about him.
It was about Eric.

30:54.790 --> 30:56.890
There are a million reasons
to say no to a job,

30:56.925 --> 30:59.193
but you do it too much,
and the phone stops ringing.

30:59.228 --> 31:02.396
I bet you had acting gigs that
weren't exactly the stuff of dreams.

31:02.431 --> 31:04.565
You do the work because
that's what it means

31:04.600 --> 31:06.098
to be a professional.

31:07.102 --> 31:08.835
So, how do we go about finding this car?

31:08.870 --> 31:10.570
Zeus put a tracker in the money bag.

31:10.605 --> 31:12.071
Signal died in Long Beach.

31:12.106 --> 31:13.573
And you didn't tell Aram?

31:13.608 --> 31:14.640
You saw how he is.

31:14.676 --> 31:17.677
Sometimes, you have to save
a client from himself.

31:26.587 --> 31:29.037
The last signal came from here.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.056
- Listen...
- Wait in the car?

31:32.092 --> 31:34.058
Don't you think we've moved past that?

31:53.613 --> 31:54.688
Eddie?

31:56.649 --> 31:58.449
That lock. It's brand-new.

32:13.965 --> 32:16.799
Eric. Hey. Eric, can you hear me?

32:18.101 --> 32:19.200
Looks like they drugged him.

32:19.236 --> 32:22.137
All right, man, we're going to
get you out of here, okay?

32:30.714 --> 32:31.946
Eric.

32:31.982 --> 32:33.782
We're taking you to my personal doctor.

32:33.817 --> 32:35.349
He'll make sure you're okay.

32:35.385 --> 32:38.919
Why are you doing this, Mr. Nazarian?

32:38.954 --> 32:41.276
How did you even know I was here?

32:42.224 --> 32:45.393
Look, all that matters is you're safe.

32:48.364 --> 32:49.863
Thank you for finding him.

32:49.899 --> 32:51.665
I'll have my people
send you both a check.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.267
We're not done. We still got to I.D.
the kidnappers.

32:54.303 --> 32:55.368
That's not necessary.

32:55.404 --> 32:56.969
How is it not necessary?

32:57.005 --> 33:00.206
You stuck a gun in my face.
I think I deserve an answer.

33:00.241 --> 33:02.542
This warehouse is owned by Oleg.

33:02.577 --> 33:04.644
You think it's Oleg,
let us gather the evidence.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.776
Do this right. Don't take
this into your on hands.

33:06.811 --> 33:08.196
He kidnapped my son.

33:08.231 --> 33:10.382
Aram, you don't have to do this.

33:10.418 --> 33:11.983
It's the only thing I can do.

33:14.888 --> 33:16.436
Something's wrong.

33:17.191 --> 33:18.223
It's too easy.

33:18.258 --> 33:19.391
Easy how?

33:19.427 --> 33:21.126
Think about it.

33:21.161 --> 33:22.461
Oleg was careless enough

33:22.496 --> 33:24.581
to hold Eric in one of his own buildings,

33:24.616 --> 33:26.908
but the kidnappers
never showed their faces,

33:26.943 --> 33:29.534
and they wiped down this
whole room for fingerprints.

33:29.569 --> 33:32.704
So, maybe whoever did this set Oleg up

33:32.739 --> 33:34.238
so Aram would go after him.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.707
That makes sense.

33:35.742 --> 33:36.733
Thank you.

33:36.769 --> 33:38.038
The two of them, they go to war.

33:38.073 --> 33:40.211
Both their organizations
get weakened or wiped out.

33:40.247 --> 33:42.671
You know who benefits? Deacon.

33:43.215 --> 33:45.315
Maybe this was Deacon's way
of stopping them.

33:47.686 --> 33:48.685
Sam?

33:50.589 --> 33:52.222
Did you just fall?

33:52.257 --> 33:55.425
Come here! Get over here. Hurry up.

33:55.461 --> 33:56.526
- What are you doing?
- Come down here.

33:56.562 --> 33:59.362
- What are you doing?
- Just get all the way down here.

33:59.397 --> 34:01.230
Okay. Eric's hands and feet
were tied, right?

34:01.265 --> 34:03.484
Well, then how did he unlace
his shoes and set them here?

34:03.519 --> 34:04.939
He didn't. His captors did.

34:04.975 --> 34:06.101
Exactly.

34:06.136 --> 34:08.203
See that smudge on the patent leather.

34:11.308 --> 34:12.507
Is that what I think it is?

34:12.543 --> 34:14.409
It's a fingerprint.

34:14.445 --> 34:16.043
They wiped down the room, but...

34:16.080 --> 34:18.246
They forgot the shoes!

34:18.281 --> 34:19.914
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

34:19.949 --> 34:22.116
I have good news and bad news about
the print. What do you want first?

34:22.150 --> 34:23.717
- The good news.
- Bad news.

34:23.754 --> 34:25.553
Isn't that a little
psych profile right there?

34:25.589 --> 34:27.021
And a very telling one.

34:27.056 --> 34:28.255
Well, the good news
is I found a new backdoor

34:28.291 --> 34:29.257
into the AFS database,

34:29.292 --> 34:31.393
so I ran the print,
and it's in the system.

34:31.428 --> 34:33.194
The bad news is it's a partial print,

34:33.228 --> 34:34.695
so I have 409 possible matches.

34:34.730 --> 34:36.864
There's got to be a way
to narrow it down.

34:36.899 --> 34:38.231
That's where Monica comes in.

34:41.168 --> 34:43.404
What is that? Your manifesto?

34:43.438 --> 34:45.286
More like my psych profile
of the kidnapper

34:45.322 --> 34:46.339
based on his speech.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.375
Interior design and psych profiles?

34:48.411 --> 34:50.210
You're like the best assistant ever.

34:50.245 --> 34:51.610
If I change the search parameters,

34:51.646 --> 34:52.745
should be able to filter the results.

34:52.781 --> 34:55.447
The clipped speech
says the kidnapper is male,

34:55.483 --> 34:56.583
probably ex-military.

34:57.585 --> 34:59.318
That wiped out like half of them.

34:59.353 --> 35:00.887
Likely Caucasian, older,

35:00.922 --> 35:02.622
you know, like 30 to 40 years old,

35:02.657 --> 35:03.689
and last but not least,

35:03.725 --> 35:06.292
word use and syntax suggests
a college education.

35:06.327 --> 35:08.493
That gets us 43 matches.

35:08.529 --> 35:10.729
The power of applied psychology.

35:10.764 --> 35:12.115
You know, I'd be really impressed

35:12.151 --> 35:14.371
if you can get us <i> one</i> name instead of 43.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.802
Wait. Can you pull up that guy?

35:19.940 --> 35:22.808
Stephen Carter. We know him.

35:22.843 --> 35:25.092
As the doorman from Aram's club.

35:25.127 --> 35:28.078
Yeah, we need to find him
before Aram starts a mob war.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.187
One question, Carter.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.793
You working for yourself
or for someone else?

35:46.086 --> 35:47.358
It's just me.

35:50.363 --> 35:51.962
And look, it's not what you think.

35:51.997 --> 35:53.063
No?

35:53.099 --> 35:54.565
No.

35:54.601 --> 35:56.166
Can I show you something?

36:02.708 --> 36:05.975
Drew Hedden. Firefighter.

36:06.010 --> 36:09.212
He was my cousin.
He was like a brother to me.

36:09.248 --> 36:10.913
Was?

36:10.949 --> 36:13.383
Yeah, he died putting down
a fire in an empty building.

36:13.418 --> 36:15.418
The cops suspected it was arson,

36:15.454 --> 36:17.153
that Aram torched this building

36:17.188 --> 36:20.036
over some stupid beef with Oleg Basarov.

36:21.225 --> 36:23.492
Never found any proof,
so nothing was done.

36:23.527 --> 36:26.161
So, basically, Aram killed Drew
and got away with it.

36:26.196 --> 36:28.364
So you got a job at Aram's club.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.268
Yeah, I was planning on killing him.

36:32.303 --> 36:36.845
Then I saw how he looked at Eric
and how they looked alike.

36:37.474 --> 36:40.098
Blood test told the story,
and that was it.

36:41.210 --> 36:43.344
Wanted Aram to know exactly how it feels

36:43.380 --> 36:44.879
to lose someone you love.

36:44.914 --> 36:46.414
If that's all that you wanted,

36:46.449 --> 36:48.249
why'd you have me toss
the money out the window?

36:48.285 --> 36:51.252
Drew's wife is raising two boys
on her own now.

36:51.288 --> 36:52.694
It's for her.

36:53.455 --> 36:54.988
All right.

36:56.292 --> 37:00.460
Leave town, Carter. Leave town.

37:00.496 --> 37:02.929
You know what Aram will do
to you if he finds out.

37:02.964 --> 37:04.197
So don't tell him.

37:04.232 --> 37:05.330
Just walk away.

37:05.365 --> 37:07.434
Let Aram and Oleg kill each other.

37:07.469 --> 37:08.968
The world will be better off.

37:09.004 --> 37:11.103
You were a cop. You know
that better than anyone.

37:11.138 --> 37:12.371
I can't do that.

37:14.642 --> 37:16.342
So what are you going to do, then?

37:18.145 --> 37:20.646
Eddie, if you tell Aram,
he will kill that man.

37:20.682 --> 37:22.615
If I don't, then Aram will go after Oleg.

37:22.650 --> 37:24.650
There will be a lot more blood,
a gang war.

37:24.686 --> 37:26.285
So what are we supposed to do?

37:26.320 --> 37:27.752
Any way we go, people are dead.

37:27.788 --> 37:31.191
It's part of the job. Sometimes
any choice you make, you lose.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.558
Like with Unit 23?

37:35.929 --> 37:38.229
Guess you're a better detective
than I thought.

37:40.658 --> 37:43.334
You know, but the one thing
I learned is...

37:43.369 --> 37:44.901
I hate to lose.

37:51.510 --> 37:53.444
There's no need to go to war, Aram.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.221
Oleg's not behind this.

37:55.256 --> 37:56.333
You both need to leave.

37:56.368 --> 37:58.081
We found the kidnapper's phone,

37:58.116 --> 37:59.916
the one that he took that picture with.

37:59.952 --> 38:02.084
- Where'd you get this?
- Not Oleg.

38:02.119 --> 38:04.487
Don't toy with me. I want names.

38:06.791 --> 38:09.792
Aram, I understand your anger. I do.

38:09.828 --> 38:12.528
To have a family member taken from you,

38:12.564 --> 38:16.466
what man wouldn't do whatever
he could to get justice,

38:16.501 --> 38:18.367
to punish whoever did this?

38:18.402 --> 38:21.436
But you're not the only one
with that story.

38:21.472 --> 38:24.439
The man that we're talking about
lost family because of you.

38:27.872 --> 38:31.112
Well, be that as it may,
this man took my son.

38:31.147 --> 38:32.814
He took my money. He knows who Eric is.

38:32.850 --> 38:33.846
I can't have that.

38:33.881 --> 38:36.149
If anything happens to him or to us,

38:36.185 --> 38:37.903
I made sure it all points back to you.

38:37.939 --> 38:40.053
You'll go away for life. Lose it all.

38:40.089 --> 38:42.857
What kind of relationship are you
hoping to have with Eric then,

38:42.892 --> 38:45.092
especially once he knows
what you did in his name?

38:46.161 --> 38:48.729
I have to strike back.
There's no other option.

38:48.765 --> 38:51.498
Yes, there is. Let him live.

38:51.533 --> 38:53.566
I'll make sure he says nothing
about Eric.

38:53.602 --> 38:55.735
The genie will go back in the bottle.
Everybody wins.

38:55.771 --> 38:57.203
What about my money?

38:57.238 --> 38:59.238
Think you owe it to the family.

38:59.274 --> 39:01.541
You got your boy back. They didn't.

39:02.843 --> 39:07.704
Aram, this is the better way,
the only way.

39:09.917 --> 39:11.583
I want to talk to this man.

39:23.397 --> 39:24.596
You're erasing it?

39:24.632 --> 39:26.330
Just another sand mandala.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.065
Oh, it's a thing of beauty.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.667
Your skills were also impressive.

39:29.702 --> 39:32.537
Without us, they might not have
been able to solve the case.

39:32.572 --> 39:34.038
They're lucky to have us.

39:37.577 --> 39:39.911
You're about to ask me out. Don't.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.614
Case is closed,

39:47.649 --> 39:49.519
and nobody died in a hail of bullets.

39:49.555 --> 39:50.921
I call that a win.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.889
And an almost-happy ending.

39:53.416 --> 39:55.625
But that's not the only good news.

39:55.661 --> 39:58.194
My office is done. Do you want to see it?

39:58.229 --> 39:59.762
May as well get it over with.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.262
Ah. So...

40:05.297 --> 40:06.635
what do you think?

40:06.671 --> 40:07.903
Now, I know we had a deal,

40:07.939 --> 40:09.805
so I can put it all back if you hate it.

40:18.448 --> 40:21.749
I think if Aram can make
his peace, then I can, too.

40:23.286 --> 40:24.619
Now, see that up there?

40:24.654 --> 40:26.988
That, though, is a bridge too far.

40:27.023 --> 40:28.911
- It's got to go.
- Don't you just feel that way

40:28.947 --> 40:30.257
because your name isn't on your door?

40:30.293 --> 40:31.626
But guess what.
I'm going to take care of that.

40:31.661 --> 40:32.560
What just happened?

40:32.596 --> 40:34.294
You just turned my "no" into your "yes"?

40:34.329 --> 40:35.274
- No.
- Yes.

40:35.309 --> 40:36.663
I got to go.

40:36.699 --> 40:38.098
What's that? Codename: Livorno?

40:38.133 --> 40:39.800
You never figured that out, did ya?

40:39.835 --> 40:41.635
I must be losing my edge.

40:42.705 --> 40:44.838
Thank God he lost his edge.

40:44.874 --> 40:48.241
If Eddie knew about this, he
would never let me live it down.

40:48.276 --> 40:49.374
Ever.

40:49.409 --> 40:51.677
Since when do you care what Eddie thinks?

40:51.713 --> 40:52.845
You're not...

40:52.881 --> 40:54.446
No.

40:54.482 --> 40:56.415
Well, I'm just glad
you had a change of heart

40:56.450 --> 40:57.416
about this whole thing.

40:57.451 --> 40:58.651
This is a step forward.

40:58.686 --> 41:00.586
Is it a baby step? Yeah, it is.

41:00.622 --> 41:02.488
But once you're back on track,

41:02.524 --> 41:05.525
you can put Eddie and this whole
P.I. business behind you.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.159
Yeah.

41:07.194 --> 41:08.693
I guess.

41:08.729 --> 41:10.762
Syd, you promise this won't play
in the States?

41:10.797 --> 41:13.264
I swear on my two ex-husbands.

41:13.299 --> 41:15.466
Only in Italy. You're huge in Italy.

41:16.701 --> 41:18.970
Miss Swift? Two-minute warning.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.640
Come with?

41:21.675 --> 41:23.775
Humiliation must be faced alone.

41:25.545 --> 41:27.711
Okay, are you ready, Samantha?

41:27.747 --> 41:29.212
As ready as I'll ever be.

41:29.248 --> 41:31.949
You look beautiful. Here we go.

41:31.984 --> 41:35.553
Camera and action!

41:35.588 --> 41:37.855
Pizzeria Mama Livorno!

41:37.890 --> 41:41.425
<i>La piu deliziosa pizza Del mondo!</i>

41:42.894 --> 41:44.994
Happy pizza dance.

41:46.443 --> 41:47.630
Happier.

41:47.666 --> 41:50.667
Happier! And cut.

41:50.702 --> 41:53.670
Fantastic, Samantha. <i>Bellissimo.</i>

42:01.946 --> 42:04.913
Oh, my God. You knew?!

42:04.949 --> 42:06.815
How did you find me?!

42:06.850 --> 42:08.516
Talking about? It's what I do.

42:08.552 --> 42:09.798
Oh, hold on. Say cheese!

42:09.834 --> 42:11.019
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Say it. Say it.

42:11.055 --> 42:12.721
No, do not take a pic...
You... You erase that.

42:12.756 --> 42:13.989
- No, no, no, no. Unh-unh.
- Erase that right now!

42:14.024 --> 42:15.590
- See, we're even now.
- Right now, Eddie!

42:15.625 --> 42:17.157
You know one of my secrets.
I know one of yours.

42:17.193 --> 42:18.525
I got... I got to ask you,

42:18.561 --> 42:19.969

or were you <i> being</i> a pizza?

42:20.004 --> 42:21.006
- Give me the...

42:21.031 --> 42:22.362
- Because I really
felt that performance.

42:22.398 --> 42:23.497
I actually got hungry. I did.

42:23.532 --> 42:24.398
I want to take a big bite of you.

42:24.433 --> 42:26.233
Uh-oh, now you're a little spicy pizza.
