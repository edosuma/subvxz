WEBVTT

00:05.455 --> 00:06.418
Hey!

00:06.484 --> 00:08.048
Did you know
that everybody here

00:08.216 --> 00:10.319
Went out last night without us?

00:10.387 --> 00:12.927
Oh, nerds!

00:16.427 --> 00:17.563
Nerds?

00:20.335 --> 00:21.935
Nerds.

00:22.002 --> 00:23.531
Yeah, Thursday night thunder.

00:23.599 --> 00:25.226
That's been going on for years.

00:25.294 --> 00:27.294
You know about it? How come
I've never been invited?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.829
Don't you think
th's a little bit rude?

00:28.896 --> 00:30.195
Well, I yelled "baba booey"

00:30.262 --> 00:31.825
At Walter Cronkite's funeral,

00:31.892 --> 00:34.983
So I actually have no idea
of what's rude or not.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.085
Yeah, well, let me...

00:36.152 --> 00:37.553
But I couldn't thunder
last night,

00:37.621 --> 00:39.021
Because I had to take
Angie to the ER.

00:39.088 --> 00:41.223
She had some complications
with her pregnancy,

00:41.291 --> 00:43.558
So that kind of trumps
your little problem.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.494
Ah, yeah, you're right.
How is she?

00:46.561 --> 00:48.162
Well, she's fine,
and the baby's fine,

00:48.230 --> 00:49.530
But they put her on bed rest

00:49.597 --> 00:50.931
Till her blood pressure
goes down.

00:50.998 --> 00:52.932
Well, listen, tray,
if there's anything I can do,

00:52.999 --> 00:54.065
Please let me know.

00:54.133 --> 00:55.366
There's one thing.

00:55.434 --> 00:57.034
Could you take care of Angie
like a husband

00:57.102 --> 00:59.035
Until this whole ass-ache
blows over?

00:59.103 --> 01:00.336
Absolutely not.

01:00.404 --> 01:01.337
What about you, k?

01:01.405 --> 01:02.905
I'm on it, sir!

01:26.492 --> 01:27.692
Oh, my.

01:27.759 --> 01:29.626
I haven't seen your brow
that furrowed

01:29.694 --> 01:32.228
Since you saw that picture
of Helen mirren in a bikini.

01:32.296 --> 01:33.965
How is it possible?
Is she a wizard?

01:34.032 --> 01:35.466
A question
for another time, Lemon.

01:35.534 --> 01:36.934
I was with Avery last night,

01:37.002 --> 01:39.237
And I almost had
a Nancy-related incident.

01:39.304 --> 01:40.639
Oh, Jack.

01:40.706 --> 01:42.407
Oh, Nan...

01:42.475 --> 01:43.506
Na.

01:43.573 --> 01:44.504
What?

01:44.572 --> 01:45.871
I was saying,
"oh, Nana."

01:45.939 --> 01:48.307
Have I not told you
about my grandmother fetish?

01:48.374 --> 01:51.076
Avery actually tried
to get on board.

01:51.143 --> 01:52.377
Later that night,

01:52.445 --> 01:53.811
She put some mothballs
behind her ears

01:53.879 --> 01:54.812
And fed me peppermints.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.648
She is in it to win it.

01:56.715 --> 01:58.116
This can't go on.

01:58.184 --> 02:01.620
I'm making a decision
about Nancy and Avery today.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.187
I'm going in the bunker.

02:03.255 --> 02:04.655
No distractions.

02:04.722 --> 02:06.072
I had Jonathan remove the bar

02:06.140 --> 02:08.338
And my collection
of 18th century french erotica.

02:08.406 --> 02:10.306
I've had to make
some tough calls over the years,

02:10.374 --> 02:12.008
Switching sheinhardt's
wig production

02:12.076 --> 02:14.010
To 100% chinese cadaver hair,

02:14.077 --> 02:17.013
Turning down Dick Cheney's
offer to become king of Iraq,

02:17.080 --> 02:20.483
Selecting
the brand-new logo for NBC.

02:20.551 --> 02:21.984
It's fresh.

02:22.052 --> 02:23.219
But this Nancy-Avery thing

02:23.287 --> 02:26.389
Is the toughest decision
I've ever had to make.

02:26.456 --> 02:28.291
Well, I'm glad
you're taking it seriously.

02:28.358 --> 02:31.327
Although, sometimes when
you try so hard to find love,

02:31.395 --> 02:33.996
You can't see that it's been
standing in front of you

02:34.064 --> 02:35.464
The whole time.
Oh, good God.

02:36.533 --> 02:37.567
What did you come in here for?

02:39.670 --> 02:42.705
Last night, I saw
my entire staff out at a bar.

02:42.773 --> 02:44.041
They go out every week
and I'm never invited.

02:44.608 --> 02:45.708
Do they not even like me?

02:45.776 --> 02:47.277
Oh, don't worry.
It's healthy.

02:47.344 --> 02:49.012
Bosses need to keep
their distance

02:49.079 --> 02:50.380
From their subordinates.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.515
Mr. Donaghy, I have to
run out to Mr. Jordan's house.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.117
I'll call you when I get there
so you know I'm safe.

02:54.185 --> 02:55.451
No! I don't care
if you're safe!

02:55.519 --> 02:56.653
I love you!

02:56.720 --> 02:57.787
After four years,

02:57.855 --> 02:59.589
I thought I was close
with these people.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.024
I thought we were a family.

03:01.091 --> 03:02.192
Don't say family.

03:02.259 --> 03:03.760
Then I see them
out at a bar without me,

03:03.827 --> 03:05.361
Giving each other
windmill high-fives?

03:05.429 --> 03:06.729
<i>Like in top gun.</i>

03:06.797 --> 03:08.631
But this is your staff.
You can't let it bother you.

03:08.699 --> 03:11.067
You could always come up here
and have a drink with me,

03:11.135 --> 03:12.135
A fellow manager.

03:12.203 --> 03:13.570
Oh, great,
that sounds really fun.

03:13.637 --> 03:15.572
I'll just pour myself a drink.

03:18.409 --> 03:22.378
Oh, I dropped my glass!

03:22.446 --> 03:23.846
Is that supposed to be a broom?

03:23.914 --> 03:25.048
Anchor the handle.

03:25.115 --> 03:26.082
Yeah.

03:26.150 --> 03:27.217
There it is.

03:33.624 --> 03:35.625
This better be important.
I'm in a meeting.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.726
Mr. Jordan,

03:36.794 --> 03:39.429
The situation here
has deteriorated.

03:39.496 --> 03:40.663
Great update, Ken.

03:40.731 --> 03:42.365
Thanks for checking in.
Talk to you later.

03:42.433 --> 03:43.399
Actually, sir,

03:43.467 --> 03:45.735
I think you should come home.

03:45.736 --> 03:46.736
***

03:48.403 --> 03:49.803
If she sees me again.

03:49.871 --> 03:51.805
She wants you to come help her.

03:51.873 --> 03:53.106
What? But why?

03:53.174 --> 03:55.409
You're much better
at that serving stuff than I am.

03:55.476 --> 03:56.777
Well, your wife thinks

03:56.845 --> 03:58.979
Taking care of her
should be your job

03:59.047 --> 04:00.814
And I have to agree, sir.

04:00.882 --> 04:02.516
You made a promise
to care for her

04:02.584 --> 04:03.508
In sickness and in health.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.410
Don't you remember
your wedding vows?

04:05.477 --> 04:07.845
To be honest, I couldn't
really understand anything

04:07.913 --> 04:09.380
Rick James was saying.

04:09.448 --> 04:10.648
Come home, Mr. Jordan.

04:10.716 --> 04:12.250
Mrs. Jordan needs you.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.152
Fine, I'll be there soon.

04:14.219 --> 04:15.420
And if you get hungry,

04:15.487 --> 04:17.555
You can help yourself
to anything in the fridge,

04:17.623 --> 04:18.790
And once I'm there,

04:18.857 --> 04:20.591
I'll determine
how much to charge you.

04:26.298 --> 04:27.699
Hey, buddies.

04:27.766 --> 04:29.968
Anybody do anything fun
last night?

04:31.236 --> 04:33.204
What about you, Frank?
What did you do?

04:33.272 --> 04:35.173
I, uh, had a...

04:35.240 --> 04:36.374
Doctor's appointment.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.775
Oh, really?
For what?

04:37.843 --> 04:39.110
Oh, uh...

04:39.178 --> 04:42.213
Oh, God, it looks like
the underside of an octopus!

04:42.281 --> 04:44.048
Hey, Liz, can I talk
to you and Jenna in...

04:44.116 --> 04:46.117
The office where everyone
clips their toenails?

04:46.185 --> 04:47.518
Not cool, guys.

04:49.755 --> 04:50.788
As you guys know,

04:50.856 --> 04:52.490
I'm getting married
on may 22nd.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.691
You are? Still?

04:53.959 --> 04:55.159
Well, it was off for a while,

04:55.227 --> 04:56.828
Because my fiance
was on his dad's yacht

04:56.895 --> 04:58.196
And got captured by pirates,

04:58.263 --> 05:01.032
But now,
thanks to the a-team, he's back.

05:01.099 --> 05:02.233
Sure.

05:02.301 --> 05:03.501
He has a different energy now.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.036
He's quieter.

05:05.103 --> 05:06.838
But we're getting married.

05:06.905 --> 05:07.872
And are we still
in the wedding?

05:07.940 --> 05:09.340
Of course.

05:09.408 --> 05:11.275
The bridesmaids are you guys,
Andy roddick's wife,

05:11.343 --> 05:12.510
My dutch cousins,

05:12.578 --> 05:14.579
And Penelope cruz's
hotter sister Monica.

05:14.646 --> 05:16.514
You're gonna be
so out of place, Liz.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.849
Anyway, my mom said
that if you guys

05:17.916 --> 05:18.983
Are gonna
throw me a work party,

05:19.051 --> 05:20.251
It has to be this week.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.019
- Oh, no! Really?
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

05:22.087 --> 05:23.437
It's just that the schedule's
really filling up

05:23.845 --> 05:25.345
Now that aris
is finally getting over

05:25.413 --> 05:26.380
His Stockholm syndrome.

05:26.448 --> 05:27.748
Oh, that reminds me.

05:27.816 --> 05:28.882
You guys may have to walk
down the aisle

05:28.950 --> 05:30.451
With some pirates.

05:30.518 --> 05:32.486
It's just, I don't think
I can plan a party this week.

05:32.554 --> 05:33.554
I'm doing a juice fast,

05:33.621 --> 05:35.055
And it's making me
really grouchy.

05:35.123 --> 05:37.057
Aah!

05:37.125 --> 05:38.358
You know what?
This is perfect.

05:38.426 --> 05:40.627
I'll have that party...
Tonight,

05:40.695 --> 05:42.096
And it'll be fun,

05:42.163 --> 05:44.031
And you'll all see
that I'm fun.

05:44.099 --> 05:45.532
So screw both of you!

05:45.600 --> 05:47.301
And screw everybody out here!

05:47.368 --> 05:49.470
Liz Lemon is having a party!

05:49.537 --> 05:50.737
* and they're ain't no party *

05:50.805 --> 05:52.072
* like a Liz Lemon party *

05:52.140 --> 05:54.475
* 'cause a Liz Lemon party
is mandatory *

05:59.062 --> 06:00.195
All right, Donaghy,

06:00.263 --> 06:02.898
Follow your heart.

06:02.965 --> 06:05.133
"hard equations
and rational thinking."

06:14.444 --> 06:16.311
Damn you, heart.

06:26.689 --> 06:27.622
I'm sorry, sir.

06:27.690 --> 06:29.458
There's
a minor janitor problem.

06:29.525 --> 06:30.892
I apologize for letting
a kashmiri

06:30.960 --> 06:32.294
Into your office.

06:32.361 --> 06:34.362
I just need five minutes
of your time, Mr. Donaghy.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.773
Now would be a good time,
actually,

06:44.841 --> 06:46.374
To handle
the janitor situation.

06:46.442 --> 06:47.809
But, sir, what about...

06:47.877 --> 06:49.244
I always say bosses should stay

06:49.312 --> 06:50.946
Deeply involved
with their subordinates.

06:51.013 --> 06:52.547
Does this mean you're coming
to my cabaret?

06:52.615 --> 06:55.984
Jonathan, close the door.

06:56.052 --> 06:57.886
Please.

06:57.954 --> 07:00.655
So what can I do for you?

07:00.723 --> 07:01.312
It has been a week,

07:01.380 --> 07:03.181
And I've heard
nothing from you, sir.

07:03.249 --> 07:04.449
Have you forgotten
our agreement

07:04.517 --> 07:06.017
About me taking over 11:30?

07:06.085 --> 07:08.319
I'm sorry. What?

07:08.387 --> 07:10.021
Five years ago,
I threatened to quit

07:10.089 --> 07:12.123
Unless you got me
out of the late night shift.

07:12.191 --> 07:14.492
Wow, other than
some notable recent exceptions,

07:14.560 --> 07:16.528
Nbc never guarantees
employment terms

07:16.595 --> 07:18.129
Five years in advance.

07:18.197 --> 07:19.798
I have a contract.

07:21.767 --> 07:23.368
That is my signature.

07:23.436 --> 07:26.938
You signed it
on April 22, 2005.

07:27.006 --> 07:29.040
Okay, in my defense,
every April 22nd,

07:29.108 --> 07:31.409
I honor Richard Nixon's death
by getting drunk

07:31.477 --> 07:33.278
And making
some unpopular decisions.

07:33.345 --> 07:34.879
Well, I want the earlier shift.

07:34.947 --> 07:36.481
It's better pay
and more prestigious.

07:36.549 --> 07:38.316
Ever since I am a little boy,

07:38.384 --> 07:40.719
I am dreaming
of hosing the tonight shift.

07:40.786 --> 07:42.153
Okay. Uh, calm down,

07:42.221 --> 07:44.022
Uh, Khonani.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.790
I understand
that I made you a promise,

07:45.858 --> 07:48.126
And we're going to keep it,
because this is NBC...

07:48.194 --> 07:50.028
<i>the biggest loser network.</i>

07:50.096 --> 07:51.629
So you'll fix this?
Today?

07:51.697 --> 07:54.365
Well, this is
a janitor emergency,

07:54.433 --> 07:55.500
And I really have no choice

07:55.568 --> 07:57.168
But to make it
my number one priority.

07:57.236 --> 07:58.803
Good. Thank you.

07:58.871 --> 08:00.371
Can I have those pictures

08:00.439 --> 08:02.974
For a special book
the janitors keep?

08:03.042 --> 08:04.709
Absolutely not.

08:08.647 --> 08:09.748
Aah!

08:09.815 --> 08:11.182
Good monster!

08:11.250 --> 08:12.751
Good scary monster!

08:12.818 --> 08:15.820
Hey, Ken, isn't that
a fun place to stand?

08:15.888 --> 08:19.046
Oh, I forgot to warn you
about my dog, Tracy senior.

08:19.214 --> 08:21.015
I trained him
to hate white people,

08:21.083 --> 08:22.049
Because, not to profile,

08:22.117 --> 08:23.484
But most ghosts are white.

08:23.552 --> 08:25.686
This is my boy here.

08:25.754 --> 08:27.321
And look what Angie did to him.

08:27.389 --> 08:29.356
She set up an invisible fence.

08:29.424 --> 08:31.725
He gets shocked if he tries
to leave the property,

08:31.793 --> 08:34.028
Just because he'd run away
and cause car accidents

08:34.096 --> 08:36.263
And impregnate
neighbors' horses.

08:36.331 --> 08:38.099
He's trapped here just like me!

08:38.166 --> 08:40.034
Sir, you're not trapped.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.070
Mrs. Jordan just wants you
to be here for her.

08:43.138 --> 08:44.205
I'm trying, Ken,

08:44.272 --> 08:45.606
And I want to be responsible,

08:45.674 --> 08:47.842
But I've been me
for a long time.

08:47.909 --> 08:49.577
Well, Mrs. Jordan
isn't asking for a lot.

08:49.644 --> 08:50.978
Right now,
she just has a craving

08:51.046 --> 08:52.446
For a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

08:52.514 --> 08:54.715
No, we're not supposed
to do any sex stuff

08:54.783 --> 08:56.283
While she's on bed rest.

08:56.351 --> 08:59.353
Oh! Like a real one!

08:59.421 --> 09:00.421
I'm on it!

09:02.858 --> 09:03.791
Maybe this'll get Angie

09:03.859 --> 09:05.292
To stop calling me
irresponsible.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.861
Just stay focused

09:06.928 --> 09:09.463
And take this sandwich
to my wife.

09:09.531 --> 09:10.531
Nope!

09:10.599 --> 09:12.433
I'm in a strip club!
My bad!

09:14.870 --> 09:17.304
Hey, Jenna, if I'm expecting
about 20 people tonight,

09:17.372 --> 09:18.672
How much ice should I get?

09:18.740 --> 09:20.808
Oh, you don't want
to mess with that stuff, Liz.

09:20.876 --> 09:23.144
Ice has caused a lot of ods
in the porn community.

09:23.211 --> 09:25.880
Oh, you mean frozen water?
I don't know.

09:25.947 --> 09:27.882
Well, I just don't
want to forget anything.

09:27.949 --> 09:30.184
Don't worry.
No one's expecting a lot.

09:30.252 --> 09:31.719
No, tonight
is gonna be different.

09:31.786 --> 09:33.787
There's gonna be booze
and a karaoke machine

09:33.855 --> 09:35.022
And that Black Eyed Peas song

09:35.090 --> 09:36.223
They wrote for bar mitzvahs.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.914
Jenna Maroney to the floor.

09:38.002 --> 09:40.103
Sure, it will.

09:40.171 --> 09:41.104
Hello?

09:41.172 --> 09:42.338
Lemon, you know Subhas,

09:42.406 --> 09:44.240
The current
first-shift janitor?

09:44.308 --> 09:45.475
Uh, kind of.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.043
According
to the janitor community,

09:47.111 --> 09:48.111
You call him frequently

09:48.179 --> 09:49.579
Regarding
home toilet situations.

09:49.647 --> 09:50.814
No, it's not that.
We're dating.

09:50.881 --> 09:51.881
Lemon, please.

09:51.949 --> 09:53.950
Look, I just need
his phone number.

09:54.018 --> 09:55.819
What does this have to do
with Avery and Nancy?

09:55.886 --> 09:56.886
That is taking a backseat

09:56.954 --> 09:58.788
To this janitor situation
right now.

09:58.856 --> 10:00.657
I need Subhas to step down.

10:00.724 --> 10:02.058
But Subhas does a great job.

10:02.126 --> 10:03.193
Look, five years ago,

10:03.260 --> 10:05.128
I promised Khonani
the earlier shift.

10:05.196 --> 10:06.563
Why would you ever
promise that?

10:06.630 --> 10:08.097
Honestly, these immigrants
have a tough life,

10:08.165 --> 10:09.165
No health care,

10:09.233 --> 10:10.834
And I kind of just thought
he'd die

10:10.901 --> 10:12.168
Before it became a thing.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.970
Are you sure that
you're not just using this

10:14.038 --> 10:16.139
As an excuse to avoid
your real problem?

10:16.207 --> 10:18.441
Lemon, this is
a janitor emergency.

10:18.509 --> 10:19.542
I need that phone number.

10:19.610 --> 10:20.577
Okay, let me find it.

10:20.644 --> 10:22.245
Subhas...Scrolling.

10:22.313 --> 10:24.047
- I know you know it by heart.
- 917...

10:26.617 --> 10:27.851
All right, Khonani,

10:27.918 --> 10:29.752
If I've learned anything
from recent experience

10:29.820 --> 10:31.387
It's that we have to handle
this next step

10:31.455 --> 10:32.956
With Subhas very delicately.

10:33.023 --> 10:33.957
Oh, don't worry.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.491
Subhas will want to leave,

10:35.559 --> 10:36.926
Spend time on his hobbies.

10:36.994 --> 10:39.863
He collects classic car...

10:39.930 --> 10:41.097
Cardboard.

10:41.165 --> 10:42.999
Classic cardboard.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.969
Ken!

10:46.036 --> 10:48.371
Why did you let me
go to a strip club?

10:48.439 --> 10:50.273
I tried to stop you, sir,

10:50.341 --> 10:51.574
But you threw your dog at me!

10:51.642 --> 10:54.110
This is bad,
because I can't change!

10:54.178 --> 10:56.802
I'm like a chameleon,
always a lizard!

10:59.051 --> 11:01.353
This better be a meeting,
'cause I'm important!

11:01.421 --> 11:02.554
Tracy, it's Liz.

11:02.622 --> 11:04.256
I want you to know
that at my party tonight,

11:04.324 --> 11:05.657
You're off the leash.

11:05.725 --> 11:07.059
I want to see the behavior

11:07.127 --> 11:09.361
That got you kicked out
of the inaugural ball.

11:09.429 --> 11:10.462
I can't, l.L.

11:10.530 --> 11:12.231
First of all,
the secret service

11:12.298 --> 11:14.433
Never gave me back
my t-shirt cannon,

11:14.501 --> 11:15.601
And second of all,

11:15.668 --> 11:17.403
I gotta stay home
and take care of Angie!

11:17.470 --> 11:18.537
What? No!

11:18.605 --> 11:20.272
Come on, you have to come.
I need you.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.640
This party
has to be off the hook.

11:21.708 --> 11:23.342
People don't say that anymore.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.411
They say
"surf party, usa."

11:25.478 --> 11:26.912
Tracy, this is important.

11:26.980 --> 11:28.781
I have to prove
to my co-workers

11:28.848 --> 11:31.250
That I am not some angry,
un-fun woman,

11:31.317 --> 11:33.118
Who doesn't deserve
to be included.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.958
Look, Liz Lemon,
I know your feelings are hurt,

11:40.026 --> 11:41.493
But parties are like frisbees.

11:41.561 --> 11:43.328
If you throw them
the wrong way,

11:43.396 --> 11:45.063
They'll veer off
in a bad direction,

11:45.131 --> 11:47.633
And then your kid
will fall into a quarry.

11:47.700 --> 11:48.767
What?

11:48.835 --> 11:50.469
Don't throw
a party for vengeance.

11:50.537 --> 11:52.037
It will turn on you,

11:52.105 --> 11:55.774
Like your wife after your kid
has fallen into a quarry.

11:55.842 --> 11:58.076
You know what? Fine.
I don't need you.

11:58.144 --> 12:01.747
I am gonna crush
this party Liz-Lemon style.

12:01.815 --> 12:03.315
I don't know what to do.

12:03.383 --> 12:04.516
A party's in trouble,

12:04.584 --> 12:05.818
And I'm the only one
that can save it,

12:05.885 --> 12:08.620
But your wife and
unborn daughter need you here.

12:08.688 --> 12:09.955
- I'm torn, k-pax.

12:10.023 --> 12:11.457
I know I should be here,

12:11.524 --> 12:13.625
But my body's gonna
take me to Liz Lemon's.

12:13.693 --> 12:14.660
What do I do?

12:19.821 --> 12:22.190
Put the electric
dog collar on me.

12:22.258 --> 12:24.392
It would be my honor.

12:27.002 --> 12:28.503
Subhas, thank you for coming in

12:28.570 --> 12:31.406
And for showing me
your, uh, special book.

12:31.473 --> 12:33.408
More men in it
than I would have expected.

12:33.475 --> 12:34.542
Book is book.

12:34.610 --> 12:35.810
Indeed.

12:35.878 --> 12:38.713
Uh, Subhas, you've
been with us a long time,

12:38.781 --> 12:40.048
And you've
done great work here,

12:40.115 --> 12:41.549
But we need some new blood.

12:41.617 --> 12:43.718
I've decided that it's time
for you to step aside,

12:43.786 --> 12:45.887
And Khonani will take over
at 11:30.

12:45.954 --> 12:47.455
No! I'm in a union!

12:47.523 --> 12:48.589
Well, I have a contract!

12:48.657 --> 12:50.258
Meeting over!

12:50.326 --> 12:51.459
No, no, hold on.

12:51.527 --> 12:54.295
There's always another option.

12:54.363 --> 12:56.064
What of we re-invent
the way people

12:56.131 --> 12:57.699
Think about
their nightly trash removal?

12:57.766 --> 12:59.200
No, thank you.

12:59.268 --> 13:01.602
What if the night shift
just got a whole lot earlier?

13:01.670 --> 13:03.037
Gentlemen, there is a way

13:03.105 --> 13:04.405
For everybody to get
what they want

13:04.473 --> 13:06.074
And for me to look
like a genius and a hero.

13:06.141 --> 13:07.375
You're bullcrapping us.

13:07.443 --> 13:09.377
No, I am not.
I am "innoventing."

13:09.445 --> 13:11.612
A word that I just innovented.

13:13.148 --> 13:14.415
NBC.

13:16.118 --> 13:17.719
It's fresh.

13:19.488 --> 13:22.623
Man, Tracy senior
took off fast.

13:22.691 --> 13:24.292
He did not want to live here.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.660
Sir, far be it from me

13:25.728 --> 13:27.562
To question a plan
this well thought out,

13:27.629 --> 13:30.020
But what's going to keep you
from just taking the collar off?

13:30.088 --> 13:31.722
You're gonna pour glue
in the lock.

13:31.790 --> 13:35.225
That's how my kids keep me
out of the liquor cabinet.

13:35.293 --> 13:36.960
And, of course,
I'll be here to help.

13:37.028 --> 13:40.164
No, Ken, there's something
else you have to do...

13:40.231 --> 13:41.765
For all of us.

13:41.833 --> 13:45.202
Unfortunately, there's
only one Tracy Jordan,

13:45.270 --> 13:48.338
But sometimes
he's needed in two places.

13:51.242 --> 13:52.509
You're Tracy Jordan now.

13:52.577 --> 13:53.711
Go.

13:53.778 --> 13:55.079
Go save that party.

13:55.146 --> 13:56.280
Yes, sir!

13:58.116 --> 14:00.384
Wait. I don't walk
that well.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.701
There he is.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.436
How's your first day going?

14:19.504 --> 14:21.638
Oh, I don't know.
You tell me.

14:21.706 --> 14:23.741
Khonani, I don't know
enough about being a janitor

14:23.808 --> 14:25.075
To understand
what you're trying to tell me.

14:25.143 --> 14:26.710
There's no trash, Jack.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.612
Ever since you moved Subhas
to 10:00,

14:28.680 --> 14:29.847
He takes all the trash.

14:29.914 --> 14:31.648
No trash left for Khonani.

14:31.716 --> 14:33.751
Okay, well,
there's a solution to this.

14:33.818 --> 14:36.653
What if you and Subhas
share 11:30?

14:36.721 --> 14:38.756
No, I wouldn't do that
to 11:30.

14:38.823 --> 14:40.424
What are you talking about?

14:40.492 --> 14:41.625
<i>What
are you talking about?</i>

14:41.693 --> 14:43.761
There are two people
who want the same thing.

14:43.828 --> 14:44.895
They can't both have it.

14:44.963 --> 14:45.996
You need to make a decision.

14:46.064 --> 14:48.288
I can't.
Damn it, I can't.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.722
Don't you think
I know what it's like

14:49.790 --> 14:50.857
To have two amazing people

14:50.925 --> 14:52.859
Who both want the same thing?
I do!

14:52.927 --> 14:55.662
And with Nancy and Avery,
I'm the thing, Khonani.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.664
I'm the trash shift.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.032
That sounds very difficult.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.900
It's impossible.
It's paralyzed me.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.002
I just want everyone
to be happy.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.671
It doesn't work that way.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.207
One person's heart
is going to be broken.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.944
You have to choose.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.746
I'm sticking with Subhas,
Khonani.

15:13.814 --> 15:14.814
I'm sorry.

15:14.882 --> 15:16.950
Okay. I know
that was hard for you.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.551
And don't worry.

15:18.619 --> 15:21.988
I have a job for me at FOX...

15:22.056 --> 15:22.989
Woods.

15:23.057 --> 15:24.457
Foxwoods casino.

15:24.525 --> 15:26.025
My cousin is
head janitor there.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.464
You ought to get
that cough checked out.

15:35.636 --> 15:38.238
This better be meetment,
I'm importing.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.872
Mr. Jordan,
it's Kenneth Parcell,

15:39.940 --> 15:41.507
From work and friendship.

15:41.575 --> 15:42.508
Key, Ken.

15:42.576 --> 15:43.610
With all the excitement,

15:43.677 --> 15:44.911
I forgot that Mrs. Jordan

15:44.979 --> 15:46.846
Had asked me to get
her blood pressure medicine.

15:46.914 --> 15:48.081
She left it in her car.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.650
But, sir, her car is parked
out on the street.

15:50.718 --> 15:51.918
Oh, my God.

15:51.986 --> 15:53.987
I know. It's outside
the electric fence.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.054
Oh, my God!

15:55.122 --> 15:56.322
I just didn't want
to go outside!

15:56.390 --> 15:57.457
It's chilly!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.826
I can come back.
This is all my fault.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.028
No. This is something
I have to do myself.

16:02.096 --> 16:05.398
You're a good husband,
Mr. Jordan.

16:08.224 --> 16:09.224
Sir, is there any chance

16:09.292 --> 16:10.459
Your dog followed me here?

16:10.526 --> 16:12.294
Yes. He probably
picked up your scent

16:12.362 --> 16:13.495
And is hunting you.

16:13.563 --> 16:15.330
I suggest you cut off a finger

16:15.398 --> 16:19.701
And throw it in the river.

16:29.679 --> 16:31.346
Wow, Liz.

16:31.414 --> 16:32.614
Good work.

16:32.682 --> 16:34.149
This looks
like the post-coital suite

16:34.217 --> 16:35.584
At the nba all-star game.

16:35.651 --> 16:38.387
Thanks, Jenna.

16:38.454 --> 16:40.022
Well, so now that
everyone's here,

16:40.089 --> 16:41.356
Maybe someone should
say a few words.

16:41.424 --> 16:42.624
Absolutely.

16:42.692 --> 16:44.526
* Jimmy crack corn
and I don't care *

16:44.594 --> 16:46.495
* Jimmy crack corn
and I don't care *

16:46.562 --> 16:49.164
- What are you doing?
- Juice fast delirium, Liz.

16:49.232 --> 16:51.500
Um, I'm glad
you could all make it

16:51.567 --> 16:53.001
To cerie's party.

16:53.069 --> 16:54.369
I don't have a lot to say,

16:54.437 --> 16:55.871
Just that the bar is open

16:55.938 --> 16:58.173
And the karaoke machine
is ready to go.

16:58.241 --> 17:00.876
Karaoke, awesome.
Yeah.

17:00.943 --> 17:04.479
You think I don't know
what that is?

17:04.547 --> 17:06.647
I know about
Thursday night thunder

17:06.715 --> 17:08.517
And I know
that I'm not invited!

17:08.584 --> 17:09.851
- Uh-oh.

17:09.919 --> 17:11.153
I deserve to be loved!

17:11.220 --> 17:13.155
Oh, no, she's going wide.

17:13.222 --> 17:16.258
I am a proud, single woman!

17:16.325 --> 17:17.659
How did it become about this?

17:17.727 --> 17:18.760
Go out the window!
Save yourselves!

17:18.828 --> 17:20.829
I may not have a real family,

17:20.896 --> 17:22.998
But I thought at least
I had one at work,

17:23.066 --> 17:25.223
Which is not what I wanted
for myself, by the way.

17:25.790 --> 17:26.924
You think when I was a kid,

17:26.992 --> 17:28.926
I dreamed of someday
paying $1,200

17:28.994 --> 17:30.261
For a karaoke machine

17:30.329 --> 17:32.163
To impress
a bunch of pasty losers?

17:32.231 --> 17:33.531
And a professional singer,

17:33.599 --> 17:35.700
Who's beautiful,
but doesn't know it.

17:35.768 --> 17:37.735
So now let's
all go around the room

17:37.803 --> 17:40.038
And apologize to me!

17:40.105 --> 17:42.573
Oh, my God,
this is the worst...

17:42.641 --> 17:44.342
I had nowhere else to go!

17:44.410 --> 17:46.044
Dog!

17:46.111 --> 17:47.378
Dog attack!

17:58.223 --> 17:59.590
Hmm.

17:59.658 --> 18:01.659
Maybe this doesn't work
on people.

18:01.727 --> 18:04.228
Aah! Aah!

18:04.296 --> 18:05.396
Oh, my neck!

18:05.464 --> 18:07.432
My swan-like neck!
Aah!

18:07.499 --> 18:09.133
Oh!

18:09.201 --> 18:12.537
Must...Fight...Through it.

18:12.604 --> 18:15.573
Also must...Weed...Lawn!

18:18.677 --> 18:19.844
I made it.

18:19.912 --> 18:22.013
I'm on the other side.

18:28.554 --> 18:30.021
I'm free.

18:30.089 --> 18:32.857
I can go anywhere I want...

18:32.925 --> 18:34.726
Like Liz's party

18:34.793 --> 18:35.993
Or one of those places

18:36.061 --> 18:38.463
Where you skydive
over a huge fan.

18:45.743 --> 18:48.445
Hmm...Maybe it doesn't
work on people any...

18:48.513 --> 18:50.313
Aah! It still does!

18:50.381 --> 18:51.715
Aah!

18:53.985 --> 18:56.286
Why is that thing
following you?

18:56.354 --> 18:57.487
Hunting me!

18:57.555 --> 18:58.755
Electric collar!

19:00.625 --> 19:02.092
There's no fire escape
in this room!

19:02.160 --> 19:03.794
Why are we even here?

19:03.861 --> 19:05.395
You make us show up,
you start yelling,

19:05.463 --> 19:06.630
And then we get attacked
by a dog!

19:06.697 --> 19:07.998
And Cerie didn't even come.

19:08.066 --> 19:10.167
That's just
a cardboard cutout of her.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.535
But I rescued her.

19:12.970 --> 19:15.472
Quiet! Quiet!
Everybody shut up!

19:15.540 --> 19:17.808
We need to figure out
what we're gonna do.

19:22.246 --> 19:25.382
Oh, really?
Now I'm a part of the group?

19:25.450 --> 19:27.217
Now you like me
because you're in trouble

19:27.285 --> 19:28.919
And you need someone
to bail you out?

19:28.986 --> 19:30.987
Yes, that's exactly
why we like you.

19:31.055 --> 19:33.390
We love you.
You solve our problems.

19:33.458 --> 19:34.591
That's what you're good at.

19:34.659 --> 19:36.259
So what if you're
not fun at parties?

19:36.327 --> 19:37.861
Yeah. You know
who's fun at parties?

19:37.929 --> 19:40.597
Paris Hilton, Andy Dick, Tracy,

19:40.665 --> 19:41.998
And they're all
gonna burn in hell.

19:42.066 --> 19:43.233
Oh, God!

19:43.301 --> 19:45.068
If you deliver me from this,

19:45.136 --> 19:47.704
I promise every Sunday
for the rest of my life,

19:47.772 --> 19:49.773
I'll go to...

19:49.841 --> 19:51.475
Huh?

19:51.542 --> 19:53.243
I'm through it.

19:53.311 --> 19:54.878
Pizza Hut.

19:54.946 --> 19:56.813
I'll go to pizza hut.
Ha!

19:56.881 --> 19:58.748
Look, if this is a family,

19:58.816 --> 20:00.217
That makes you the mom,

20:00.284 --> 20:02.152
And you don't want to go out
drinking with your mom.

20:02.293 --> 20:04.460
You want mommy
to make the monsters go away.

20:05.696 --> 20:07.130
- Oh, please
- come on!

20:09.300 --> 20:12.769
Everything's
gonna be all right.

20:13.971 --> 20:16.739
Oh. Okay, Tracy senior,

20:16.807 --> 20:18.408
Let's see what you've got.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.578
Aah!

20:22.646 --> 20:24.314
Oh! Aah!

20:24.381 --> 20:27.083
Run! Run, my losers!

20:29.653 --> 20:31.788
Aah!

20:31.855 --> 20:33.056
Great party, Liz.

20:33.123 --> 20:34.624
Everybody take some cupcakes!

20:34.692 --> 20:35.825
Aah!

20:39.965 --> 20:40.866
Hi, Subhas.

20:40.934 --> 20:43.268
I have an extra headshot
I was gonna throw out,

20:43.335 --> 20:45.403
Unless you want it
for something.

20:45.471 --> 20:48.073
No!
You're not book!

20:48.140 --> 20:50.809
Why?
What am I doing wrong?

20:50.876 --> 20:53.378
Wanting to be book is not book.

20:53.446 --> 20:55.513
Mm...

20:55.581 --> 20:57.515
So you solved
your janitor thing.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.185
Now back to Nancy and Avery?

21:00.252 --> 21:01.686
<i>Top gun high-five
for courage?</i>

21:01.754 --> 21:03.955
Only because you look
like you need it so badly.

21:04.023 --> 21:05.256
I'm fine with that.
