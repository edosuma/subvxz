WEBVTT

00:00.983 --> 00:02.983
This is
"The Final Word with Perd."

00:03.606 --> 00:06.041
With your host,
Perderick L. Hapley.

00:06.358 --> 00:09.727
Issue number one is the first
issue we're going to talk about.

00:09.795 --> 00:12.630
Is Bobby Newport's campaign
for city council in trouble?

00:13.198 --> 00:14.699
When I say your names,
I want you to respond.

00:15.566 --> 00:16.100
Dylan.

00:16.168 --> 00:18.903
Well, Newport's poll numbers
have been plummeting.

00:18.971 --> 00:21.305
They just fired
his campaign manager,

00:21.372 --> 00:22.672
and where's Bobby?

00:22.740 --> 00:23.841
He's on vacation in Spain.

00:23.908 --> 00:26.276
He's not on vacation,
he's in hiding.

00:26.344 --> 00:28.879
Every time the guy speaks,
he puts his foot in his mouth.

00:28.947 --> 00:30.848
[Laughs]
That's a hilarious image.

00:30.915 --> 00:32.716
A foot in a mouth.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.352
It's a common expression.

00:35.419 --> 00:36.553
Okay.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.154
According to the newest polls,

00:38.222 --> 00:40.422
Leslie knope
is now in second place.

00:40.490 --> 00:42.124
She's just 15 points back.

00:42.192 --> 00:43.392
Whoa, yeah!
[Cheering]

00:43.460 --> 00:44.660
How did she close the gap?

00:44.728 --> 00:45.995
You have to give
a lot of credit

00:46.063 --> 00:47.563
to her campaign manager,
Ben Wyatt.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.399
So apparently, Newport just
fired his campaign manager

00:50.467 --> 00:52.401
because Ben was kicking his ass.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.603
Ben is the best campaign manager
anyone could ever have.

00:55.671 --> 00:57.973
Every move he's made has worked.

00:58.040 --> 01:02.410
He's like a brilliant,
sexy, little hummingbird.

01:02.478 --> 01:03.544
What did you just say?

01:03.612 --> 01:05.180
Nothing.
Keep up the good work.

01:05.248 --> 01:07.415
You're doing great.

01:07.483 --> 01:09.016

01:29.770 --> 01:32.405
Senior citizens are basically
the only people who vote

01:32.472 --> 01:34.540
in local elections,
so if you want to win,

01:34.608 --> 01:35.875
you gotta get the gray vote.

01:35.943 --> 01:37.043
And to get the gray vote,

01:37.111 --> 01:38.711
you need to get the endorsement
of Ned Jones.

01:38.779 --> 01:40.946
He's the president
of Pawnee Seniors United.

01:41.014 --> 01:43.048
He's like <i>The Godfather</i>
but old.

01:45.919 --> 01:47.886
The "grond" father,
he's like--

01:47.954 --> 01:50.855
It doesn't matter.
He's important, and he's old.

01:50.924 --> 01:53.792
Mr. Jones,
such a pleasure to meet you.

01:53.859 --> 01:54.893
Please don't get up.

01:54.961 --> 01:57.128
Don't worry.
I can't.

01:57.195 --> 01:58.862
- Oh.
- Just joking.

01:58.931 --> 02:01.665
I can get up.
But it's difficult.

02:01.733 --> 02:03.600
But I can do it,

02:03.668 --> 02:06.470
but it is hard.

02:06.538 --> 02:08.271
Look,
I don't have a lot of time.

02:08.340 --> 02:10.874
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

02:10.943 --> 02:12.443
Is it... cancer?

02:12.510 --> 02:16.479
No, I don't have a lot of time
before my swim aerobics.

02:16.547 --> 02:17.747
Oh.

02:17.815 --> 02:20.716
Why are you better
for seniors than Bobby Newport?

02:20.784 --> 02:21.717
Three words:

02:22.785 --> 02:24.487
Ramp Up Pawnee.

02:24.555 --> 02:26.122
Pawnee is way behind the times

02:26.190 --> 02:28.425
in terms of making its buildings
wheelchair accessible.

02:28.492 --> 02:30.792
Not enough ramps
is the number three complaint

02:30.860 --> 02:32.061
among Pawnee seniors...

02:32.128 --> 02:36.298
Right behind "everything hurts"
and "I'm dying."

02:37.733 --> 02:39.668
You wanted to see me.

02:39.735 --> 02:42.237
Good God.
What the hell are you doing?

02:42.305 --> 02:43.505
Upside-down sit-ups.

02:43.573 --> 02:45.739
Great exercise, and it literally
lets me see

02:45.807 --> 02:47.141
the world
from a different perspective.

02:47.209 --> 02:50.611
Isn't there a men's gymnasium
where you could do that?

02:50.679 --> 02:52.480
The world's my gymnasium,
Ron.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.815
But I will stop
if it makes you uncomfortable.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.584
Could you hold me
while I dismount?

02:56.651 --> 02:58.586
[Groans]

03:00.922 --> 03:02.456
- Thanks so much.
- [Clears throat] You bet.

03:02.523 --> 03:03.590
Question for you.

03:03.657 --> 03:05.592
In a town of this size,
the Parks department

03:05.659 --> 03:07.727
traditionally has ten employees.

03:07.795 --> 03:10.063
You have only seven.
Why is that?

03:10.131 --> 03:11.999
I work hard to make sure
my department

03:12.066 --> 03:14.534
is as small and ineffective
as possible.

03:14.602 --> 03:16.769
The department is so small
because Leslie Knope

03:16.837 --> 03:19.138
single-handedly
does the work of four people.

03:19.206 --> 03:20.939
And she's already scaled back
her time.

03:21.008 --> 03:22.875
If she wins,
she'll be dividing her time

03:22.942 --> 03:24.510
between Parks and City Council.

03:24.577 --> 03:26.379
I'm going to have
to hire a deputy director

03:26.446 --> 03:27.446
to pick up the slack.

03:27.514 --> 03:30.716
No!
Chris, that's unnecessary.

03:30.783 --> 03:32.985
The department is doing fine
without Leslie.

03:33.052 --> 03:35.353
Then prove it.
Complete one major project.

03:35.421 --> 03:38.123
Either we complete
a government project

03:38.190 --> 03:39.391
which is abhorrent to me,

03:39.458 --> 03:41.692
or we bring a new person
into the department,

03:41.760 --> 03:43.395
which repulses me
to my core.

03:43.462 --> 03:46.064
Reminds me
of when my dad made me choose

03:46.132 --> 03:49.033
which of my pet calves
to slaughter with my own hands

03:49.100 --> 03:51.335
for my sixth birthday.

03:51.403 --> 03:56.773
I couldn't choose,
so I slaughtered both of them.

03:56.841 --> 03:58.708
And they were delicious.

03:58.776 --> 04:00.344
Essentially,
we're going to put a ramp

04:00.412 --> 04:01.345
on every building in town.

04:01.413 --> 04:03.013
Like I always say,

04:03.081 --> 04:04.848
stairs are
a young man's game.

04:04.916 --> 04:06.516
Damn straight.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.984
This is very impressive.

04:09.053 --> 04:11.654
You know,
you remind me of my brother.

04:11.721 --> 04:13.656
You have the same name,
Leslie.

04:13.723 --> 04:17.826
He lost a third of his body
in a motorcycle accident.

04:17.894 --> 04:19.795
The middle third.

04:19.863 --> 04:21.696
But they sutured
the hell out of him.

04:21.764 --> 04:23.898
He's--
he's fine now.

04:23.966 --> 04:28.002
Much shorter, but
a good-looking, young, flat man.

04:28.071 --> 04:31.339
What have you heard about
Newport's new campaign manager,

04:31.407 --> 04:32.340
Jennifer Barkley?

04:32.408 --> 04:33.775
Uh, who?

04:33.842 --> 04:36.278
She wants to have a meeting
with me at 5:00.

04:36.345 --> 04:37.678
I told her sorry.

04:38.245 --> 04:42.349
I don't talk politics
after dinner.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.087
Oh my God... Newport hired
a real Washington hotshot.

04:46.154 --> 04:48.322
Wow,
she worked with James Carville?

04:48.390 --> 04:50.391
She ran two Republican
congressional campaigns

04:50.459 --> 04:51.925
and a Senate race.

04:51.993 --> 04:53.659
Yeah,
and check out this picture.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.262
She's eating egg salad
with Colin Powell.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.898
That's the most impressive thing
I've ever seen.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.266
Why are you smiling?

05:00.334 --> 05:03.069
Why is this terrifying
information making you smile?

05:03.137 --> 05:04.471
Newport's scared.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.439
I mean, he must've shelled out
a fortune to hire her.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.575
- So what do we do next?
- I'm going to set up a meeting.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.210
I mean, we can size her up,
but more importantly,

05:11.277 --> 05:13.579
it'll humanize you and make it
harder for her to attack you.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.315
And we'll do it
at JJ's Diner.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.682
Home field advantage.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.018
As a candidate, I appreciate
your strategic mind,

05:20.086 --> 05:21.753
but as woman,
all I care about is

05:21.821 --> 05:24.923
your slight but powerful body.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.757
Hello, Ann Perkins.

05:27.325 --> 05:29.727
This is the first time you've
said my entire name correctly.

05:29.794 --> 05:31.729
Nonsense.
We are close friends.

05:31.796 --> 05:33.364
I have good news for you.

05:33.432 --> 05:35.966
I'm making the water fountain
hygiene upgrade

05:36.034 --> 05:37.201
our number one priority.

05:37.269 --> 05:38.302
Oh, great.

05:38.370 --> 05:39.637
For some reason,

05:39.704 --> 05:42.172
when people in Pawnee
use the water fountain,

05:42.240 --> 05:45.375
they put their mouths completely
over the spouts.

05:45.443 --> 05:48.811
It's like this weird,
disgusting, local quirk.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.980
Kiss one water-fountain drinker,

05:51.048 --> 05:53.883
you're kissing everyone
in Pawnee.

05:54.451 --> 05:55.918
Including him.

05:55.986 --> 05:57.753
I'd like
to complete this project

05:57.820 --> 05:59.955
by... tomorrow.

06:00.023 --> 06:00.956
Oh.

06:01.024 --> 06:01.957
Set up shop in our office.

06:02.025 --> 06:03.659
In fact, take Leslie's desk.

06:03.726 --> 06:05.694
Okay, I will.
Thanks. Great.

06:05.762 --> 06:07.095
Do you want
the door open or shut?

06:07.164 --> 06:08.096
Ah, open's fine.

06:08.165 --> 06:11.433
Okay.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.734
Hello, Marta.

06:12.802 --> 06:14.435
We would like
our regular table,

06:14.503 --> 06:16.804
but we want you to set it up
a little fancier than normal

06:16.872 --> 06:18.239
because we're trying
to impress someone.

06:18.307 --> 06:19.307
You mean Ms. Barkley.

06:19.375 --> 06:20.642
She's already here.
Last booth.

06:20.709 --> 06:22.910
Leslie Knope.
Hi.

06:22.978 --> 06:24.078
I'm Jen Barkley.

06:24.146 --> 06:25.346
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:25.414 --> 06:26.681
Grab a seat.

06:26.748 --> 06:27.782
Thanks.

06:27.849 --> 06:28.983
Sorry about all these papers.

06:29.051 --> 06:30.617
I had them shipped in.
I'm a news junkie.

06:30.685 --> 06:32.219
Is this in Arabic?

06:32.287 --> 06:34.521
Well, I've been reading up
on you two.

06:34.589 --> 06:36.490
Ben, it's a great job
on this campaign.

06:36.558 --> 06:38.292
Oh.
Well, thank you.

06:38.359 --> 06:40.960
And Leslie,
your Parks work, it's no joke.

06:41.028 --> 06:42.796
This is
federal government caliber.

06:42.863 --> 06:46.399
Not to sound rude,
but what are you doing here?

06:46.466 --> 06:49.001
This campaign seems beneath you.

06:49.069 --> 06:50.203
Yeah.

06:50.270 --> 06:52.738
Bobby Newport's daddy called me
out of the blue.

06:52.806 --> 06:54.307
I'd never heard
of Bobby Newport before,

06:54.374 --> 06:55.741
but it became clear
in two seconds

06:55.809 --> 06:57.310
this guy is a moron.

06:57.377 --> 06:58.611
So I was, like,
"sorry, Nick.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.580
Your son is a moron.
There's no way."

07:00.647 --> 07:02.214
Then he offered me
a crazy amount of money.

07:02.281 --> 07:04.048
I shouldn't even tell you
how much.

07:04.116 --> 07:06.318
But I will.
$250,000.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.653
Good lord.
For six weeks of work?

07:08.721 --> 07:09.821
I know.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.523
Plus frankly, I needed
a break from Washington.

07:12.091 --> 07:13.658
Do you know Joe Biden?

07:13.726 --> 07:14.659
Oh, mm-hmm.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.394
He's on my celebrity sex list.

07:16.462 --> 07:18.596
Well,
he <i>is</i> my celebrity sex list.

07:18.663 --> 07:20.331
Oh, trust me.
You can do better than Joe.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.465
[Laughing]
Oh, no.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.234
I don't--
I don't think I can.

07:23.301 --> 07:24.568
[Laughs]

07:24.636 --> 07:25.703
No way.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.571
[Laughing]

07:27.639 --> 07:29.673
Oh, man.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.642
I knew I shouldn't
have met you guys.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.410
Now I kind of hope you win.

07:34.978 --> 07:36.713
She's just doing this
for the money.

07:36.780 --> 07:38.514
She doesn't even like
her own client.

07:38.582 --> 07:40.616
This could be
the best case scenario for us.

07:40.683 --> 07:43.518
Or the real best case scenario
is if she just takes the money

07:43.586 --> 07:45.186
and doesn't even try.

07:45.255 --> 07:47.689
Tell me a little bit
about Leslie Knope.

07:47.757 --> 07:49.424
Well, Perd,
Leslie Knope represents

07:49.492 --> 07:51.693
everything that is wrong
about politics in America.

07:51.761 --> 07:54.263
She's naive,
she's untested,

07:54.330 --> 07:55.997
and she's
an entrenched bureaucrat

07:56.065 --> 07:58.633
that's got the stink
of big government all over her.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.800
- Oh, God.
- What?

07:59.868 --> 08:01.835
Wow, strong words
from a powerful lady.

08:01.903 --> 08:02.970
So I guess
we both agree.

08:03.037 --> 08:06.840
Leslie Knope
is wrong for Pawnee.

08:06.908 --> 08:08.108
Worst case scenario.

08:08.176 --> 08:09.677
Worst case scenario!

08:11.006 --> 08:12.677
I'm Leslie Knope

08:13.006 --> 08:13.857
and when I grow up,

08:13.858 --> 08:17.728
I want to be a unicorn princess
or a city councilor.

08:17.945 --> 08:20.480
Wrong.
Not in my town, kid.

08:20.548 --> 08:23.916
City council's a real job
for a real adult.

08:23.984 --> 08:26.052
It's playing every hour
on every channel.

08:26.119 --> 08:27.887
It's official.
I hate Jennifer Barkley.

08:27.954 --> 08:29.922
When I go to that senior center,
I'm going to go up onstage,

08:29.990 --> 08:31.191
and I'm going
to viciously attack her.

08:31.192 --> 08:33.125
Okay, don't let Barkley
knock us off message.

08:33.193 --> 08:36.294
We are going there
to get Ned Jones' endorsement,

08:36.361 --> 08:37.929
- and that's huge.
- You're right.

08:37.996 --> 08:39.597
And I should listen
to you always

08:39.666 --> 08:41.265
because you are a man genius

08:41.333 --> 08:44.836
with a taut, narrow frame
like a sexy, elf king.

08:45.704 --> 08:47.806
Do you wish I were taller or--
what's going on?

08:47.873 --> 08:49.140
Nothing.
You're perfect.

08:49.209 --> 08:50.042
Okay, everyone.

08:50.043 --> 08:52.643
So the Health department
is working on a poster campaign

08:52.711 --> 08:54.812
to warn people about diseases.

08:54.879 --> 08:58.949
Now we are going to build
a better water fountain for the parks.

08:59.017 --> 09:01.285
Andy is our official
water-fountain tester.

09:01.353 --> 09:03.790
All right, let's give
this sucker a test-drive.

09:08.658 --> 09:11.160
Yeah, so the idea
is to make a fountain

09:11.229 --> 09:13.930
that he can't do that to.

09:13.997 --> 09:15.164
Ah, that's good.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.367
Okay, any ideas?
Jerry?

09:17.435 --> 09:19.436
Well, I was thinking that

09:19.503 --> 09:22.272
we could put this cage thing
around it.

09:22.340 --> 09:24.039
Okay.
That could work.

09:24.107 --> 09:26.041
Andy?

09:29.946 --> 09:30.946
[Slurping]

09:31.013 --> 09:32.548
Yeah.

09:32.616 --> 09:33.616
Thank you, Andy.

09:33.683 --> 09:34.950
Ah, still good.

09:35.017 --> 09:36.985
- Tom?
- Full disclosure.

09:37.053 --> 09:40.187
Ann and I
are romantically intertwined.

09:40.256 --> 09:41.556
Oh, God.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.458
So let's not be surprised
if she picks my idea.

09:43.525 --> 09:44.692
Would you just go, dummy?

09:44.760 --> 09:47.161
What's the best kind
of water fountain?

09:47.229 --> 09:48.663
How about no water fountain?

09:48.731 --> 09:49.664
This...

09:50.732 --> 09:53.401
...is the Voss Water Butler
by Tumi.

09:53.469 --> 09:54.569
And only $600 a bag.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.403
April, what's your idea?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.672
To go in that room
and finish this book.

09:58.740 --> 09:59.806
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

09:59.874 --> 10:01.176
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

10:02.744 --> 10:03.710
You're going to stay here,
and you're going to help.

10:04.278 --> 10:04.911
Donna?

10:04.979 --> 10:06.881
Do I look like
I drink water?

10:07.448 --> 10:09.416
Yoo-hoo.
I'm over here.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.684
Just about to start
my presentation.

10:11.752 --> 10:14.553
I--
uh-oh, stairs.

10:14.621 --> 10:15.588
What do I do?

10:15.656 --> 10:18.157
How do I get
from here to there?

10:18.224 --> 10:20.593
I'm not
a professional mountain climber.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.561
It's a real problem in our town,

10:22.629 --> 10:25.731
but not any more,
thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.933
We're going to put ramps
in every building in this town

10:29.001 --> 10:32.003
because if there's one thing
I believe,

10:32.070 --> 10:34.739
it's that stairs are
a young man's game.

10:34.807 --> 10:35.740
Yeah.

10:35.808 --> 10:37.241
[Applause]

10:37.310 --> 10:39.711
Ramps are an idiot's game.

10:39.779 --> 10:42.347
This is nothing more
than a worse version

10:42.415 --> 10:43.947
of Bobby Newport's plan.

10:44.015 --> 10:45.081
What plan?

10:45.149 --> 10:46.750
Bobby Newport
doesn't have a plan.

10:46.818 --> 10:49.219
Was somebody just talking
about Bobby Newport's plan?

10:49.287 --> 10:51.922
Because Ned Jones and I
would love to share it with you.

10:51.989 --> 10:53.023
Come on out here, Ned.

10:53.590 --> 10:55.125
Ned Jones is here.

10:55.193 --> 10:56.893
[Applause]
Say hello to Ned Jones.

10:56.961 --> 10:58.729
Make way for Ned Jones.

10:58.797 --> 11:00.563
Why don't we just
turn up the pressure?

11:00.631 --> 11:04.334
That way you don't have
to put your mouth so close.

11:04.401 --> 11:06.235
All right, here we go.

11:06.303 --> 11:08.304
Ah, stop!

11:08.372 --> 11:09.605
Honey, I'm sorry.

11:09.673 --> 11:11.574
That'll teach you
to pay attention.

11:11.642 --> 11:13.743
I have an idea.

11:13.811 --> 11:15.877
Um, I was thinking,
"what if we did

11:15.945 --> 11:17.212
"something like...

11:17.279 --> 11:18.279
this?"

11:18.348 --> 11:22.250
Oh, my--
dude, what the hell?

11:22.318 --> 11:26.588
Bobby Newport's plan is called
"Rise Up! Pawnee."

11:26.656 --> 11:28.457
He is going to put
an electric lift

11:28.524 --> 11:32.760
on every outdoor staircase
in town.

11:32.828 --> 11:34.428
Wow.
[Applause]

11:34.496 --> 11:36.230
Now you could use a ramp,

11:36.297 --> 11:38.298
but that seems
like a lot of work.

11:38.367 --> 11:40.668
Bobby Newport thinks
that the stairs

11:40.736 --> 11:43.237
should do the work for you,
don't you agree?

11:43.304 --> 11:44.572
Give him a hand.

11:44.639 --> 11:48.842
As President
of Seniors United,

11:48.909 --> 11:53.346
I endorse Bobby Newport.

11:53.414 --> 11:54.647
[Cheers and applause]

11:55.715 --> 11:57.650
I've started meeting with people
to fill in for Leslie.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.319
I have found five candidates
I'd like to hire

12:00.388 --> 12:02.689
and two I'd like
to be lifelong friends with.

12:02.757 --> 12:04.656
Well, you will not
be hiring anyone

12:04.724 --> 12:07.493
because my department is just
finishing up a major project.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.494
Incoming!

12:08.561 --> 12:11.329
[Balloon pops, screaming]

12:11.398 --> 12:12.765
[Laughs]
Got you!

12:12.832 --> 12:14.933
[Screaming]

12:15.001 --> 12:16.301
Donna, don't!

12:16.369 --> 12:17.436
[Screaming continues]
Excuse me.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.037
Help,
everything I'm wearing is suede!

12:19.105 --> 12:20.838
Everything I'm wearing is suede,
everything I'm wearing is suede!

12:20.906 --> 12:22.373
Excuse me, everybody.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.842
Attention!

12:27.913 --> 12:29.947
I think you'll agree
that this department

12:30.015 --> 12:31.649
could use a little leadership.

12:31.717 --> 12:33.350
Kamikaze!

12:33.419 --> 12:34.552
Oh.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.053
[Laughs]

12:40.020 --> 12:41.653
"Stumbling for the
first time in months,

12:41.801 --> 12:43.902
"the Knope campaign
seems to be rolling down

12:44.270 --> 12:45.803
"a ramp to nowhere."

12:47.371 --> 12:49.072
We are getting
our butts kicked

12:49.140 --> 12:51.108
by a guy who is not even
in the country.

12:51.175 --> 12:53.744
He's making out
with some floozy in Majorca.

12:53.812 --> 12:55.413
Sorry,
I wish I was better at this.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.384
Then you could be making out
with some floozy in Majorca.

12:59.451 --> 13:01.551
Maybe we take the fight to her?

13:01.619 --> 13:03.286
I mean I could try to get you
on Perd's show,

13:03.353 --> 13:04.921
and you could tell him
how she stole your idea.

13:05.988 --> 13:06.756
That sounds good.

13:06.824 --> 13:07.990
Okay, I'll just do that.

13:08.058 --> 13:10.627
I can call, or maybe
I'll just go down there.

13:11.694 --> 13:12.495
Hey.

13:12.563 --> 13:13.763
Chris wants you in his office

13:13.831 --> 13:15.398
for the final round
of interviews.

13:15.466 --> 13:17.833
[Groans]

13:17.901 --> 13:20.903
And sorry
we goofed around so much.

13:20.970 --> 13:22.771
Normally,
I'd be very proud of you

13:22.839 --> 13:24.239
for what you did.

13:24.307 --> 13:25.507
This is a rare example

13:25.575 --> 13:27.910
where wasting a full day
of work is a bad thing.

13:27.977 --> 13:29.912
Is there really going to be
a weird, new person

13:29.979 --> 13:31.379
in the office?

13:31.448 --> 13:32.614
I think so.

13:32.682 --> 13:35.752
We may be in for
a good, old-fashioned shake-up.

13:37.820 --> 13:39.186
Jennifer Barkley.

13:39.254 --> 13:40.922
You two-faced, carpetbagging--

13:40.989 --> 13:42.356
Hi, Leslie.
Good to see you.

13:42.424 --> 13:44.158
Hi, nice to see you, too.
You are a two-faced, carpet--

13:44.225 --> 13:45.860
You want anything?
Anything? It's on me.

13:45.928 --> 13:47.428
Everything in this town
is so cheap.

13:47.496 --> 13:48.263
I would never accept anything

13:48.264 --> 13:49.696
from a two-faced,
carpetbagging--

13:49.764 --> 13:50.730
- Leslie.
- Please.

13:50.798 --> 13:51.932
Let me get my insults out.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.666
I've been practicing it
the whole way over here.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.035
I sense that you're angry.
Tell me why.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.473
Because you stole my idea,
and yours won't even work.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.674
Ramps are more practical,

14:00.741 --> 14:02.642
and they're less expensive
than lifts.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.010
My idea is better.

14:04.078 --> 14:06.645
Oh, I don't doubt it.
The fact is I don't care.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.814
Ramps, lifts,
your plan, my plan--

14:08.882 --> 14:10.248
I don't actually care
about any of this.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.350
I'm just trying to win.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.019
Look, it's not personal.
I like you.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.021
But my job is to beat you.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.556
So have a seat.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.324
I'll get you
some of those waffles you love.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.659
- How do you know that--
- It's my job to know.

14:21.727 --> 14:23.495
- [Whispers] God, you're good.
- I know.

14:24.062 --> 14:25.530
Hi, guys.
What's so imporant?

14:25.598 --> 14:29.501
Well, after yesterday's
hands-on brainstorming session--

14:29.568 --> 14:30.502
Water balloon fight.

14:31.069 --> 14:32.036
Fair enough.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.438
We think we came up
with a fountain idea

14:34.507 --> 14:35.974
that really works.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.909
Presenting
the amazing spoutless fountain.

14:38.977 --> 14:41.044
Huh?
What?

14:41.112 --> 14:42.546
We just removed
the splash guard

14:42.614 --> 14:44.515
because if it's not there,
you can't put your mouth on it.

14:44.582 --> 14:46.583
Well,
I'll-- I'll try it.

14:46.651 --> 14:48.251
[Slurps]

14:48.819 --> 14:49.818
[Laughs]

14:49.819 --> 14:51.588
- I did it.
- Good job, babe.

14:51.656 --> 14:55.424
Simple, elegant,
and cost-effective.

14:55.492 --> 14:57.292
If your team keeps this up,
I think we can hold off

14:57.360 --> 14:58.995
on filling the Leslie void.

14:59.062 --> 15:01.664
I think Ben's already
filling the Leslie void.

15:01.732 --> 15:03.399
- Oh!
- Oh!

15:03.466 --> 15:04.767
I'll give it up for that.

15:05.535 --> 15:07.670
So what's Ben's next move
for you?

15:07.738 --> 15:09.371
Oh, oh, I'm not going
to tell you that.

15:09.439 --> 15:10.505
Oh, let me guess.

15:10.573 --> 15:12.007
Um, you're going to attack me.

15:12.074 --> 15:14.308
You're going to go on
that perm show again,

15:14.376 --> 15:16.611
so you could tell everyone that
that ramp idea was yours.

15:16.679 --> 15:19.614
It's "Perd,"
first of all, and no.

15:19.682 --> 15:20.815
Maybe.
No.

15:20.883 --> 15:22.751
That's not a terrible idea.

15:22.818 --> 15:24.920
No, actually,
it is kind of terrible

15:24.987 --> 15:26.754
because if you go on the air
and tell everybody

15:26.821 --> 15:28.022
that I stole your idea...

15:28.089 --> 15:29.557
- Which you did.
- Which I did,

15:29.624 --> 15:30.958
everyone's going
to think you're a sore loser,

15:31.026 --> 15:32.760
a goody-goody nerd.

15:32.827 --> 15:34.628
Because you know
what people don't care about?

15:34.696 --> 15:37.531
They don't care about whose idea
was first.

15:37.599 --> 15:40.734
They care about whose idea
was best.

15:40.802 --> 15:42.134
Well, let's say that that
was our plan, which it isn't.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.135
Mm-hmm, okay.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.572
What would you do instead?

15:45.639 --> 15:46.940
Oh, Leslie.

15:47.507 --> 15:49.408
I really shouldn't give you
campaign advice.

15:49.476 --> 15:51.878
- Right.
- Ah, what the hell.

15:51.946 --> 15:53.512
If you love chess,
which I do,

15:53.581 --> 15:55.314
but you don't have anybody
to play against,

15:55.382 --> 15:56.649
which I don't,

15:56.717 --> 15:59.585
then sometimes,
you just gotta play yourself.

15:59.652 --> 16:03.221
You could attack the Newport
plan for costing too much money.

16:03.289 --> 16:04.923
No, but that would backfire
because then we would just say,

16:04.991 --> 16:06.558
"you can never spend too much
on seniors."

16:06.626 --> 16:09.094
- Of course.
- You need to beat our idea.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.896
Come up with something better.
I don't know.

16:10.964 --> 16:13.431
Maybe a free shuttle service
for seniors.

16:13.499 --> 16:14.531
All right,
that could work.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.633
Wow.

16:15.701 --> 16:17.635
Waffles and a cappuccino.

16:17.703 --> 16:19.269
Gracias, Marta.

16:19.337 --> 16:21.171
JJ's doesn't have
a cappuccino maker.

16:21.239 --> 16:23.407
Oh, it does now.
I bought them one.

16:23.475 --> 16:24.475
Course you did.

16:25.042 --> 16:27.144
You talked to Barkley
without me?

16:27.212 --> 16:28.679
I wanted to tell her
what a jerk she was.

16:28.747 --> 16:30.913
And then she guessed
your plan immediately

16:30.981 --> 16:31.715
and demolished it.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.650
Okay, as a rule,
you shouldn't take advice

16:33.718 --> 16:35.585
from your opponent's
campaign manager.

16:35.653 --> 16:36.586
But what if she's right?

16:36.654 --> 16:37.954
Well,
what if it's a trick?

16:38.022 --> 16:40.056
I mean, maybe she thinks
our original plan would work,

16:40.124 --> 16:42.092
and she convinced you
to use her plan instead

16:42.159 --> 16:43.994
because she knows
that won't work.

16:44.061 --> 16:45.028
Or maybe she thinks
that we think that

16:45.096 --> 16:46.261
she thinks that,
so we won't do it.

16:46.329 --> 16:47.896
But she knows that I know that
she knows that--

16:47.964 --> 16:51.399
She's in our heads.
[Groans]

16:51.467 --> 16:54.503
I'm sorry, Leslie.
She's better at this than I am.

16:54.570 --> 16:56.872
Hey,
there is no one on Earth

16:57.440 --> 16:59.975
that I would rather go
into battle with than you.

17:00.043 --> 17:01.976
- Really?
- Yes.

17:02.044 --> 17:04.244
So tell me,
what do we do,

17:04.311 --> 17:05.311
my campaign manager?

17:05.380 --> 17:07.815
I don't know.

17:07.883 --> 17:08.849
Okay.

17:12.354 --> 17:14.756
I'd like to talk
about your future.

17:14.823 --> 17:16.790
Why are we on this bench?
This is weird.

17:16.858 --> 17:19.760
You did a great job
solving that problem today.

17:20.577 --> 17:22.863
The leadership you displayed
has gotten me thinking--

17:22.930 --> 17:25.031
I didn't solve that problem.
April did.

17:25.098 --> 17:28.334
Really?
Why did she tell me you did?

17:28.902 --> 17:31.337
Because she's April, and she
doesn't want you to think

17:31.405 --> 17:33.907
that she actually cares
about something.

17:34.975 --> 17:37.176
If you're looking for someone
to help fill in for Leslie,

17:37.743 --> 17:40.245
April's a pain in the ass,
but she's clearly the answer.

17:41.313 --> 17:43.550
Perhaps you're right.

17:47.887 --> 17:48.821
Should I go?

17:49.389 --> 17:51.490
Oh, you're still here?
Yes.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.294
Let's begin the show
by starting it.

17:56.361 --> 17:59.564
Now, Leslie,
you claim the Newport campaign

17:59.631 --> 18:01.334
stole one of your ideas.

18:03.402 --> 18:05.469
Well, uh...

18:05.537 --> 18:07.771
They did,
they stole our idea.

18:07.839 --> 18:09.873
We were working on
the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative

18:09.941 --> 18:11.008
for many weeks.

18:11.076 --> 18:13.711
Oh, Perd.
This is politics as usual.

18:13.778 --> 18:17.347
The fact is, Bobby Newport's
plan is better for seniors,

18:17.415 --> 18:18.615
better for Pawnee.

18:18.683 --> 18:20.117
Well,
our plan is more practical,

18:20.185 --> 18:21.118
and it's cheaper.

18:21.186 --> 18:22.585
There she goes again,
Perd.

18:22.652 --> 18:23.786
[Chuckles]

18:23.854 --> 18:26.022
I don't know where she went
the first time.

18:26.090 --> 18:28.357
Bobby Newport
cares about better,

18:28.425 --> 18:30.093
not cheaper for our seniors.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.694
And our flash poll
seems to agree.

18:31.762 --> 18:35.698
Some 78% of those we surveyed
prefer the Newport plan

18:35.766 --> 18:36.866
to the Knope plan.

18:36.934 --> 18:38.266
This is why
Ned Jones has endorsed us.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.301
Let's get back on track.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.703
I just think o opppposition
is losing sight

18:41.771 --> 18:43.939
of what all this is about.

18:44.006 --> 18:46.908
What this is about is Pawnee,
and that is what I care about.

18:46.976 --> 18:49.111
What Bobby Newport
cares about

18:49.178 --> 18:52.480
is romping around on some beach
in Spain with a floozy.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.881
[Laughs]
Excuse me?

18:53.949 --> 18:56.383
Oh, maybe you hadn't heard
of it.

18:56.451 --> 18:58.986
It wasn't in <i>the New York Times</i>
or <i>Le Monde,</i>

18:59.054 --> 19:00.420
which is what she reads.

19:00.488 --> 19:02.256
It was in the Pawnee papers.

19:02.323 --> 19:04.959
Bobby Newport's personal life
is neither here nor there.

19:05.026 --> 19:06.227
It's certainly not here.

19:06.294 --> 19:08.763
And I think Pawneeans
deserve a city councilor

19:08.830 --> 19:09.829
who stays in the city,

19:10.397 --> 19:11.966
like I do.

19:13.033 --> 19:14.267
Well, we were going
to keep this sececret

19:14.334 --> 19:15.935
until we had everything
in writing,

19:16.003 --> 19:17.370
but Bobby Newport
is trying to convince

19:17.437 --> 19:20.473
a major European company
to open up a factory in Pawnee.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.109
And that woman
that he is with

19:23.177 --> 19:24.911
is an antiland-mine advocate.

19:25.979 --> 19:27.646
I didn't realize
that you were proland-mine.

19:28.213 --> 19:30.015
I am not here
to declare a winner,

19:30.083 --> 19:32.417
but Jennifer is the winner.

19:32.485 --> 19:33.652
Thank you.

19:33.753 --> 19:35.220
Now it's time to move
onto our next segment,

19:35.288 --> 19:36.688
which is a commercial.

19:37.456 --> 19:39.758
I am going to get drunk,
and then I'm going to order

19:39.826 --> 19:41.626
a three-course meal
where each course

19:41.727 --> 19:42.760
is made of dessert.

19:42.795 --> 19:44.628
- She kicked our asses.
- Yeah.

19:44.729 --> 19:45.897
How are we going to beat her?

19:45.964 --> 19:48.599
I don't know.
I mean, she's like a hurricane.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.134
She's everywhere.

19:51.202 --> 19:52.236
Literally.

19:52.337 --> 19:54.571
Hi, guys.

19:54.639 --> 19:56.774
You really
stepped up your game.

19:56.842 --> 19:58.942
That was really fun.
You almost got me.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.743
I would have if Bobby Newport
hadn't gotten

20:00.812 --> 20:03.413
those stupid companies
to build factories here.

20:03.980 --> 20:06.249
What are you talking about?

20:06.317 --> 20:07.483
Oh, that thing I said
on the show?

20:07.551 --> 20:08.852
Oh, no.
That was mostly made-up.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.620
Don't challenge me on that.
That will backfire.

20:10.688 --> 20:12.088
Anyway, enjoy your dinner,
guys.

20:12.156 --> 20:13.356
I already took care
of the bill.

20:13.424 --> 20:15.490
[Laughs]

20:16.208 --> 20:18.260
- Another round, please?
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.856 --> 20:22.424
Nice job on the water fountain.

20:22.492 --> 20:24.125
- It wasn't me.
- Don't deny it.

20:24.193 --> 20:25.427
I know it wasn't the nurse.

20:25.995 --> 20:27.896
I'm asking you to step up.

20:28.214 --> 20:30.849
Not replacing Leslie,
just picking up some slack.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.116
I don't want to do things.

20:32.184 --> 20:35.186
I want to not do things,
just like you taught me.

20:35.253 --> 20:36.721
And I taught you well,

20:36.788 --> 20:38.956
but I don't like watching you
wasting your brain.

20:39.024 --> 20:41.992
And you're too smart to stay
my assistant here forever.

20:42.060 --> 20:43.427
I'd rather
you start a business

20:43.494 --> 20:45.129
or use your hands to farm,

20:45.197 --> 20:48.164
but right now,
the department needs you.

20:49.232 --> 20:50.633
Please.

20:50.701 --> 20:52.035
Okay...

20:52.303 --> 20:54.070
But only because you begged.

20:54.438 --> 20:56.039
Good girl.

20:56.107 --> 20:58.341
[Phone rings]

20:58.408 --> 20:59.342
Chris Traeger.

20:59.409 --> 21:00.910
This is Ron Swanson.

21:00.978 --> 21:03.679
April's going to take over some
of Leslie's responsibilities.

21:03.747 --> 21:04.813
Excellent.

21:04.881 --> 21:07.049
I have been a fan of April
since day one.

21:07.117 --> 21:08.317
I told--
