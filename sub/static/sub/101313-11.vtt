-[woman] Hi.
-Hi, there. Uh…

01:18.161 --> 01:21.372
Have you seen
a rather large, attractive gentleman?

01:21.956 --> 01:24.167
-Broad shoulders, piercing eyes.
-Hmm?

01:24.250 --> 01:27.003
Heroic face? [chuckles]

01:27.087 --> 01:28.338
Looks a little like me.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.131
You mean the plumber?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.883
-[clattering]
-[Amenadiel] Excuse me.

01:31.966 --> 01:34.302
Dad, what are you doing?

01:34.385 --> 01:36.012
Just making myself useful.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.099
You know,
tightening up fittings, replacing washers.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.852
-Don't want a flood on our hands.
-[laughs] That's--

01:42.936 --> 01:46.773
Dad, we need to speak to you
about something very serious.

01:46.856 --> 01:47.816
[Lucifer] Hmm.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.860
Lucifer tells me
that your powers have been acting up.

01:50.944 --> 01:55.115
Well, I've had a glitchy moment or two
adjusting to the mortal plane.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.784
But all is well.
I mean, take a look around.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.828
Not a musical interlude in sight.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.330

-Hmm. Excuse me.
-What--

02:05.667 --> 02:08.753
-[God] Thank you.
-[Amenadiel clears throat] What?

02:09.420 --> 02:10.505
Dad said he was fine.

02:10.588 --> 02:14.467
The creator of the universe
glitching is the literal opposite of fine.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.010
Excuse me! Excuse me, yeah.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.471
What are you still doing here anyway?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.473
You've had
your granddad time with Charlie.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.977
Shouldn't you be off somewhere until,
I don't know, his First Communion,

02:24.060 --> 02:25.603
at absolute earliest?

02:25.687 --> 02:29.149
-I told you. I'm here to help.
-I don't need your help, Dad.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.569
Not with the plumbing,
not with the feng shui of the penthouse,

02:32.652 --> 02:35.989

Oh, and some of us

02:44.956 --> 02:49.919
So, since Amenadiel has proven himself
once again to be completely useless,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.921
you and I will have to discuss this later.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.923
-I look forward to it, son.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.091

03:09.022 --> 03:10.857
But actions have consequences.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.109
One minute you're breaking the rules,

03:13.193 --> 03:16.029
and the next, you're in
a police cruiser headed downtown.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.364
What were you thinking?

03:18.448 --> 03:20.033
Stealing my handcuffs?

03:20.658 --> 03:26.247
Using official police equipment to lock
a defenseless child to a lunch table?

03:26.331 --> 03:30.418
Todd Drexhage pushed
a first-grader into a trash can. Again!

03:31.044 --> 03:34.464
Mom, I was just doing
what you do, locking up the bad guys.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.675
Okay, locking up the bad guys is my job.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.969
Your job is learning.

03:40.970 --> 03:41.846
At school.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.808
Which you won't be doing today
because you've been suspended.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.019
Excuse me,

03:48.102 --> 03:51.397
could you pretend
for one minute to be upset about this?

03:51.481 --> 03:53.942
I'm being brave, Mom. Like you are.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.403

04:00.073 --> 04:02.867
I'm sorry I made you leave work

04:06.246 --> 04:08.915
I am never stuck with you.

04:09.749 --> 04:14.462
Okay? But I can't-- I can't leave work
today, and-- and neither can your dad.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.548
-So…
-Where am I going?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.425

04:19.509 --> 04:21.511
Thank you so much for doing this.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.806
Oh, well, she's potty trained and has
never once tried to rip my earrings out,

04:24.889 --> 04:26.933
so how much trouble could she be?

or didn't say or do?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.250
No.

I'm sorry that I slept with your wife.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.751

at the time. I swear to--

to put him back together.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.483
Dad, you need to leave.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.404
Staying here on Earth is endangering
the people I care about and… others.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.323
Hey, Ella's got a body downtown.
I told her we were on our way.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.826
Lovely. Lovely.
Let me just get rid of my--

06:51.285 --> 06:52.161
[Chloe] What?

06:54.747 --> 06:55.790
Where did he go?

06:55.873 --> 06:58.459
Did time freeze again
while I wasn't looking?

06:58.543 --> 07:01.921
Actually, I believe something
far more miraculous may have happened.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.173
[chuckles] I think
for the first time ever,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.134
my father might have listened to me.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.594

07:14.225 --> 07:15.768

07:18.646 --> 07:20.982
-Just got rid of him, thank you. [laughs]
-[sighs]

07:21.065 --> 07:22.483
Hey, Ella, what do we have?

07:22.567 --> 07:26.279
Hey, so, looks like your standard
on-the-skids OD, right?

07:26.362 --> 07:28.406
Which would have been
tragic enough, but look,

07:28.489 --> 07:30.616
no track marks.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.327
Just a single injection spot
at the hairline,

07:33.411 --> 07:35.455
with enough bruising
to indicate a struggle.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.415
I mean, whoever dumped this body here

07:37.498 --> 07:40.126
wanted it to be mistaken
for an "accidental" death,

07:40.209 --> 07:43.087
but this right here? Totally a murder.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.132
Well, looks like our vic put up
quite the fight. Did you get an ID?

07:46.215 --> 07:49.385
That's the craziest part.
The victim was a fighter.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.803
Albert Walcott.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.305
-No way.
-[Ella] Way!

07:52.388 --> 07:55.892
Never would've recognized him, right?
I ran the prints three times to be sure.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.059
This is definitely him.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.352
Who's Albert Walcott?

07:59.061 --> 08:01.063
Albert "Almighty" Walcott.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.358
Former heavyweight champion
of the world, three years running?

08:04.442 --> 08:07.820
Okay. Madison Square Garden, 2015,

08:07.904 --> 08:11.657
Almighty versus
the undefeated Josh Clemson.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.785
It's round five. The fight's brutal.

Almighty taking hit after hit after hit.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.082
Clemson puts in a massive right hook.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.294
Almighty falls against the ropes.
Everyone thinks it's over, but then--

08:23.377 --> 08:27.048
Bam! Almighty hits Clemson
with an uppercut like a freight train.

08:27.131 --> 08:30.635
Clemson goes down on the canvas.
It's a knockout. The crowd goes wild!

08:30.718 --> 08:31.552
Wild!

08:31.636 --> 08:34.055
Time out, crime scene. Right.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.308
Sorry, but just to be clear,
none of that jogged your memory?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.435
No.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.813
Chloe, he was a huge sensation. Look.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.690
[Chloe sighs] Oh.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.944
Are you sure this is the same guy?

08:48.027 --> 08:50.196
Well, he's fallen upon
tough times recently.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.990
He had a heart attack
a few years ago that ended his career.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.326
I know, always thought
he'd make a comeback.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.495
Instead, he got the final TKO.

08:57.578 --> 09:01.040
Oh, I don't bloody believe this!

09:01.832 --> 09:03.251
I mean, the guy was…

09:03.334 --> 09:05.253
-Of course!
-[softly] That's my son.

09:05.336 --> 09:09.173
Of course you're still here, selfishly
putting all of humanity in danger.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.466
That's where you're wrong.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.678
My divine presence
won't be a danger to anyone because…

09:14.637 --> 09:16.305
I made myself human.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.235
What do you mean
you've made yourself human?

09:29.318 --> 09:31.279
You were worried
about my powers glitching.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.197
So I put them aside, temporarily.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.240
Check it out.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.036
Your old man is just a regular dude.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.121
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.791
And why would you think it's a good idea
to become a "regular dude"?

09:43.874 --> 09:46.794
When we were singing together,
I realized you were right.

09:46.877 --> 09:47.753
[chuckles]

09:47.837 --> 09:51.841
Sorry, could you repeat that? I would
love to capture the moment for posterity.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.260
I tried to be supportive.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.679
But how can I,

09:56.762 --> 09:59.056
if I never truly understood you?

09:59.640 --> 10:00.808
So I'm going to try.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.893
Starting right here, right now.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.104
Here and now, at my job?

10:05.187 --> 10:08.858
Well, you've clearly learned and grown
a great deal in your time on Earth.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.985
I'd just like to be
a party to that knowledge.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.322
Living in a human form. Solving cases.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.491

10:20.661 --> 10:22.830
-Oh, uh, Lucifer, you still there?
-Regretfully, yes.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.292
Wow!

10:26.375 --> 10:29.587
Did you know that when humans
close their eyes they can't see anything?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.380
-I did.
-[God] I mean, total darkness.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.924
But you open these babies and bam!
Let there be light. [laughs]

10:34.008 --> 10:35.551
-[Chloe] Hey.
-Oh, Detective.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.762
Please tell me there's
some pressing break in the case

10:37.845 --> 10:40.181
we must investigate right this minute.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.684
Well, actually, now that
your dad is here, maybe he can help.

10:43.768 --> 10:48.105
So, you are all-seeing
and all-knowing, yes?

10:48.189 --> 10:50.566
So, whodunnit? [scoffs]

10:52.568 --> 10:55.571
For once, I actually don't know.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.074
I made myself human.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.077
Isn't that exciting? [laughs]

11:03.537 --> 11:04.997
What is he talking about?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.833
Oh, he does inexplicable things
from time to time.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.961
Marsupials, pomegranates,
the gall bladder.

11:11.045 --> 11:14.548
Anyway, we've got a murder to solve,
so what say we regroup at the precinct?

11:14.632 --> 11:15.883
Just us crime solvers.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.927
Well, we can't just leave him here.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.680
[sighs] Fine. I'll call him an Uber.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.933
No. Would you like to come back with us?

11:24.016 --> 11:26.102
Oh, that sounds divine, Detective.

11:26.185 --> 11:30.356
We can do all the things you kids
normally do, but together, with me.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.273
[Lucifer grunts]

11:31.357 --> 11:35.111
-[Ella] Oh, that's gotta hurt!
-[grunting and groaning on screen]

11:40.199 --> 11:42.618
[slurping]

11:42.702 --> 11:44.995
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's so delicious.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.373
It's like snow, with fruit.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.419
-[Chloe] Hmm.
-Hi. Oh, are you the new lab tech?

11:51.502 --> 11:52.878
Oh, that's right, you haven't met.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.047
Miss Lopez, this is my father.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.632
Dad, Miss Lopez.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.634
-Your dad?
-[Lucifer] Hmm.

11:58.718 --> 12:03.139
-Oh, my God! It's so amazing to meet you.
-Oh, you too!

12:03.222 --> 12:04.515
[laughs]

12:04.598 --> 12:07.143
And I just wanna thank you
for all the support.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.061
It hasn't gone unnoticed.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.105
Anyway, can't believe I'm saying this,

12:11.188 --> 12:13.524
but can we all just,
you know, focus on the case?

12:13.607 --> 12:15.609
-[Chloe] Mm-hmm.
-[Lucifer clears throat]

12:15.693 --> 12:17.319
[slurps] Oh!

12:18.779 --> 12:20.281
My head is on fire!

12:20.364 --> 12:21.240
Brain freeze.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.452
We've all been there, big guy.
Just give it a second, it'll go away.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.997
Hmm. Yes, so,
why was Almighty breaking into a--

12:28.080 --> 12:31.000
[groans] Oh! There it is again.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.001
Put that down.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.921
What was Almighty doing
breaking into a hospital?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.424
-Well, the Internet's best guess is drugs.
-Oh.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.634
Check out the pharmacy in the background.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.429
Anything in his tox screen?

12:43.512 --> 12:46.015
Yeah. A boatload
of the drug that killed him.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.559
Some sort of synthetic stimulant.

12:48.642 --> 12:52.146
But it's weird 'cause the chemical formula
doesn't fit anything in our database.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.857
Right. Let's go to the hospital,
see if anyone knows more.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.193
[clears throat] Right. Right.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.196
-Oh, my.
-Stop drinking it so fast.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.113
It's not that.

13:01.197 --> 13:05.117
-I think I need to… you know.
-[Lucifer] Oh.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.745
Ugh. Excuse us
for just one moment, Detective.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.498
It appears I need
to take my billion-year-old father

13:10.581 --> 13:12.541
to the little boys' room. Come on.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.627
[liquid tinkling]

13:17.880 --> 13:21.425
It's cool, man. You're still in one piece.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.179
God is not gonna kill you.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.392
He'll just wait
till you die and torture you.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.561
For all eternity.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.316
[sighing]

13:40.444 --> 13:43.197
I am breathing healing energy.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.282
[inhales, exhales]

13:45.366 --> 13:48.035
[screams, gasps] Maze!

13:48.118 --> 13:50.871
I see you're handling
this celestial stuff like a champ.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.124
Well, at least your psycho behavior
finally makes sense.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.126
-Hmm.
-I mean, you're a--

13:59.380 --> 14:00.214
You're a demon.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.298
Yeah.

14:04.718 --> 14:05.678
What's Hell like?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.304
Oh, Hell is awesome.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.850
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.477
[sighs] That's a relief.

14:13.561 --> 14:18.065
The pain, torture,
the screams of doomed souls,

14:18.774 --> 14:22.403
begging for the sweet release
of a death that will never come.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.156
[laughs, exhales]

14:27.950 --> 14:29.451
Oh, you mean for you.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.288
Yeah, Hell's gonna suck, bro.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.873
[Dan chuckles]

14:33.956 --> 14:36.792
Anyway, at least you have a soul to damn.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.960
Unlike me.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.172
[gasps]

14:42.256 --> 14:43.966
Thanks for the reminder, Dan.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.343
[gasps]

14:54.226 --> 14:56.854
Yes, Albert Walcott was my patient.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.566
He suffered a cardiac event
in his dressing room after a match.

15:00.649 --> 15:01.483
[God] No.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.361
I'm sorry, this is just so exciting.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.989
I have literally no idea
what she's gonna say next.

15:07.072 --> 15:07.948
You were saying.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.035
[doctor] Well, the medics
had the sense to rush him to the ER,

15:11.118 --> 15:13.746
and I was able
to save his life with a triple bypass.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.789
It must have been difficult for Almighty.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.792
Losing the abilities
that once made him invincible.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.295
You know, I think it was, actually.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.506
He fell into a depression and stopped
showing up for his appointments.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.717
In fact, the last time
any of us here saw him,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.345
he was caught trying to steal drugs.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.971
So the Internet was right.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.767
Mr. Walcott is lucky that the hospital
administration didn't press charges.

15:34.850 --> 15:38.228
I guess they figured that video
going viral was punishment enough.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.897
So we found this in his tox screen.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.191
It's a drug our forensics team
didn't recognize.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.610
Have you seen anything like that before?

15:44.693 --> 15:46.487
Yes, unfortunately I have.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.281
This is a drug
that was developed for fighter pilots.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.700
It's colloquially known as YSD.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.746
It's very exclusive, although we have
seen a couple of overdoses in the ER.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.414
Exclusive, you say?

15:57.498 --> 15:59.458
Can you tell me what this drug looks like?

15:59.541 --> 16:01.085
I've only seen it in person once.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.797
I found a pill in the pocket
of a DOA, but as memory serves,

16:04.880 --> 16:07.341
it was, uh…

16:07.424 --> 16:08.884
small and pink.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.012
Right, what shade of pink, precisely?

16:12.096 --> 16:14.932
Bubble gum, Barbie or bougainvillea?

16:15.015 --> 16:17.184
Or sunset, cherry blossom.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.435
Flamingo.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.479
I did outdo myself with the colors.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.147
Uh…

16:22.231 --> 16:24.608
Well, I guess
you could say ballet slipper.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.652
Oh, say no more.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.655
That's the pill. Wh--

16:29.738 --> 16:30.948
How did you acquire that?

16:31.031 --> 16:32.992
Thank you, Dr. Porter,
you've been very helpful.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.827
-Yes, thank you.
-Lucifer.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.870
-[God] Thank you.
-Where did you get that?

16:36.954 --> 16:39.081
At Lux, of course.
And the doctor was right.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.375
It's very high-end
and not at all easy to come by.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.712
There's only one dealer who carries
them in town at present. The Colonel.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.131
Drinks like a fish, surprisingly charming.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.590
Reminds me of a young me.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.386
Let's arrange a buy, we'll set up a sting,
and we'll shake down this Colonel.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.971
A sting.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.139
How exciting!

16:55.222 --> 16:57.558
What should I wear? How should I speak?

16:57.641 --> 17:01.311
I always thought
this pip-pip-cheerio accent that you chose

17:01.395 --> 17:04.314
was a little over the top,
but maybe I'll give it a try.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.858
You won't be trying anything.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.235
We're dropping you off
at the penthouse on the way.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.822
As the Spanish like to say, vaya con… you.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.491
♪ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪

17:14.575 --> 17:16.076

17:19.121 --> 17:21.707
-♪ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪

17:21.790 --> 17:23.584
Okay, the perimeter's set.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.337
Our guy's all mic-ed up,
and he's heading into the buy.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.132
-Right.
-And by "our guy," I mean Lucifer.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.341
The Devil.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.801
Who we work with.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.512
[sighs] Are you sure
we should send him in there alone?

17:35.596 --> 17:39.975
Well, Lucifer's invincible now,
so what could go wrong?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.394
♪ I'm a dangerous man ♪

17:42.478 --> 17:44.438

Colonel!

17:47.149 --> 17:48.233
Nice to see you.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.986
We were just getting
to know your charming associate.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.413
Dad.

18:02.831 --> 18:06.960
-♪ Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho! ♪

18:07.544 --> 18:08.545
[Lucifer sighs]

18:09.171 --> 18:12.925
Excuse us a moment, just need
a word with my associate. [chuckles]

18:13.008 --> 18:14.968
What are you doing here?

18:15.052 --> 18:16.887
If I truly want to understand you,

18:16.970 --> 18:20.766
I have to experience
the full breadth of earthly existence.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.102
-Hmm.
-Risk, danger.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.688
You're about to be experiencing death
if you blow our cover.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.650
To the man behind the man.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.985
The man behind the man? [laughs]

18:32.069 --> 18:34.029
-Is that what you told them?
-[chuckles]

18:34.113 --> 18:37.449
Well, actually, son,
I'm the man behind all men. And women.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.408
Son?

18:39.535 --> 18:40.953
You're Lucifer's father?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.412
Did I fail to mention that?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.959
-Must have slipped my mind.
-The apple fell a ways from the tree.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.752
-Oh, yeah, I like that.
-[chuckles]

18:50.504 --> 18:53.632
Lucifer, I see where you get your
business acumen and your charm.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.801
[laughs] Oh, wrong on both counts.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.887
-He just gave me Hell, but no matter.
-[laughs]

18:58.971 --> 19:01.807
Right, here's your money.
Please hand over the drugs.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.434
[colonel] Stolz, go get the product.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.688
Well, that could have gone worse, huh?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.152
How do you think
this Colonel O'Bryan is doing?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.736
From a moral standpoint?

19:16.613 --> 19:18.031
Well, she's a drug dealer

19:18.115 --> 19:21.910
and most likely a murderer,
so probably not so great.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.830
Yeah, that's what I thought.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.624
Maybe military school isn't the answer.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.751
For Trixie.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.130
To get her back
on the straight and narrow before she…

19:34.173 --> 19:35.883
ends up… you know?

19:37.718 --> 19:40.554
Dan, you think
our 11-year-old daughter is going to Hell?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.389
I don't know.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.933
I mean, maybe.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.436
Aren't you afraid of it?
I mean, it's all real, Chloe.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.855
God. The Devil.
It's real, you know? I just, I…

19:50.480 --> 19:53.442
I wanna nudge Trixie in
the right direction before it's too late.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.486
Okay, yeah, yes, uh, Hell does exist,

19:56.570 --> 19:59.531
I just don't think one school suspension
is the road to ruin here.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.744
You'd be surprised
how easy it is to get on the wrong track.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.164
Dan.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.250
You are a great dad.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.337
Trixie's a great kid.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.131
She's just having a tween moment.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.592
I'm sure she's talking
about it to Linda now.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.764
That bully must have
done something pretty bad

20:23.847 --> 20:26.683
for you to feel
that you needed to lock him up.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.605
That's what you're going with?

20:31.688 --> 20:34.107
No wonder Lucifer's still in therapy.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.736
Oh, and B-T-dubs, you can't trick me
into talking about my feelings.

20:39.905 --> 20:40.864
Wow.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.244
Okay, well,
you're very perceptive, Trixie, you know?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.954
But I don't have to trick you.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.415
See, a therapist is
kind of like a detective.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.251
I can just look at your actions

20:52.334 --> 20:54.670
and figure out how
you're feeling from there.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.924
Like for example, sometimes when
we're really upset with someone we love,

20:59.007 --> 21:01.134
we can get scared
of expressing that feeling

21:01.218 --> 21:04.096
or even admitting it to ourselves.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.265
It's called denial.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.850
Denial makes my stomach hurt?

21:10.352 --> 21:14.022
The thing is, when we try
to stuff those feelings down too far,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.817
we may wind up
lashing out at someone else.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.611
Someone who isn't even important to us.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.864
Like Todd Drexhage.

21:22.948 --> 21:23.824
Exactly.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.619
So if I did have denial,

21:28.662 --> 21:29.871
how would I cure it?

21:30.622 --> 21:31.873
Well, if I were you,

21:33.041 --> 21:36.295
I might try to be my own detective.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.173
I'd look deep down inside my heart

21:41.008 --> 21:43.802
to find out who I was really mad at.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.431
And then
I'd tell that person how I was feeling.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.685
Even if it might hurt them?

-Earned a Silver Star in Afghanistan.
-Hmm.

as a piece of wet cardboard.

I never had to support you, son.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.898

he moved to Los Angeles all by himself,

22:37.981 --> 22:39.983

22:40.067 --> 22:42.861
-And now he's a consultant for the LA--
-Dad!

I'm feeling something entirely new.

No, no, no, my forehead is wet,
but my throat is dry,

23:58.478 --> 24:00.564
Lucifer, is the floor
starting to spin for you?

-Dad.
-Listen, shut up!

25:07.756 --> 25:10.008

Are they okay?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.845
What happened?

25:13.929 --> 25:18.308
Oh, just prevented GI Jane here
from pulling a Nietzsche.

you can poof the pain away yourself

how can you be sure that they're safe?

26:16.491 --> 26:18.201

collapse into nothingness,

Are you seriously about to critique
the way I looked while saving your life?

26:39.806 --> 26:43.143
Because if so,
pardon my resting devil face.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.814

27:15.383 --> 27:18.094
Your hair is stupid,

I've done three tours in Afghanistan.

to the other side alive.

What's your point?

28:51.896 --> 28:53.815
Well, I bet she'd be real disappointed

28:53.898 --> 28:55.734
to see her legacy going up in smoke.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.360
Trust me, she wouldn't care.

Well, being a mother myself,
I have to disagree.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.376
Damn right I did.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.670
You know who doesn't need babysitting?

34:08.963 --> 34:09.964
This guy.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.676
You glue his little feet
to the deck one time,

34:13.760 --> 34:17.722
and he sails on forever
without a single complaint.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.432
Right.

34:19.515 --> 34:22.852
Absolutely, but what does
any of this have to do with YSD?

34:22.935 --> 34:25.396
The drug helps my clients focus.

34:26.272 --> 34:29.817
Better coordination,
fewer late night calls.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.487
I know it's safe because I take it myself.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.281
Steadies the hands.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.408
Yes, but it isn't safe for everybody.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.702
Did you know about
Almighty's heart condition

34:39.786 --> 34:41.329
when you gave him the YSD?

34:41.412 --> 34:44.165
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I've never given Almighty any drug.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.168
[huffs] And he wouldn't
even have taken it if I had.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.170
His body was a temple.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.006
No alcohol, no coffee,
not so much as an aspirin.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.885
Anyone who says otherwise is a liar.

34:56.385 --> 34:57.428
Right.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.389
Well, good luck with the armada.

35:06.896 --> 35:11.317
Hold on. What if, when Almighty broke into
the hospital, he wasn't looking for drugs?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.443
Look at this.

35:12.527 --> 35:16.114
There's two doors in the hallway,
right where he got caught breaking in.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.366
So, the one on the left is the pharmacy.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.868
The one at the end of the hall is…

35:20.952 --> 35:22.203
Records room.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.121
Yes.

35:23.204 --> 35:26.165
If Almighty was digging
through private medical records…

35:26.249 --> 35:28.543
Maybe he found
something worth killing for.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.670
We have to get back
to the hospital. Let's go.

35:30.753 --> 35:33.172
Oh! Oh.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.342
I'm afraid I won't be able to come.
[chuckling]

35:36.425 --> 35:40.555
It appears that my father
has gone missing. [chuckles]

35:40.638 --> 35:42.098
God has gone missing?

35:42.181 --> 35:45.560
No, I'm sure it'll be fine. He's probably
gone to that doughnut shop he likes

35:45.643 --> 35:48.646
or decided to relive
the glory days of creation at the zoo.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.815
Anyway, you go on with the case,

35:50.898 --> 35:53.985
and I'll pop off, try and find him
and give him a stern talking-to.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.070
-Right. Okay.
-Uh…

35:57.572 --> 35:58.823
-Mm.
-Oh.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.784
I'm sorry, I just…

36:01.868 --> 36:03.452
I didn't know where we stood after…

36:03.536 --> 36:06.998
Oh, no, I shouldn't have.
I wasn't thinking. I mean…

36:07.081 --> 36:08.291
I'm the one who couldn't…

36:08.916 --> 36:11.544
-No. No, oh, my God. No. I--
-[sighs]

36:11.627 --> 36:13.129
-Mm!
-Oh!

36:13.212 --> 36:14.046
Sorry.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.966
-Oh, no, no. It's all good.
-Good.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.302
-Uh…
-Yes.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.340
[exhales]

37:01.260 --> 37:03.930
[chuckling] Well, what a lovely surprise.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.390
Are you running away too?

37:09.727 --> 37:13.064
Batten down the hatches
and crank up the Vivaldi, huh?

37:13.147 --> 37:15.441
-It's a beautiful day to operate.
-[chuckles]

37:15.524 --> 37:16.484
Scalpel.

37:24.909 --> 37:25.743
[Chloe] Dr. Porter.

37:27.745 --> 37:31.082
[Porter] I'm about to perform
an extremely delicate surgery, Detective.

37:31.165 --> 37:32.875
If you'd like to make an appointment,

37:32.959 --> 37:35.378
I'm sure my nurse
can squeeze you in tomorrow.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.672
Almighty didn't come here
looking for drugs, did he?

37:38.381 --> 37:42.468
He came here looking for records,
your records, and I saw them.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.929
They confirmed
what Almighty thought all along.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.807
That you had botched other surgeries
just like you botched his.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.936
He threatened to expose you. Didn't he?

37:52.019 --> 37:53.688
So you killed him with an overdose.

37:53.771 --> 37:58.109
YSD, the exact drug that you use
to steady the tremor in your hands.

37:58.192 --> 38:01.445
No, Albert Walcott
was a deranged, deluded addict.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.781
He was! We all saw that video.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.617
[Chloe] I know what it's like
to have people depending on you.

38:07.493 --> 38:09.745
To feel like you always
have to be the strong one

38:09.829 --> 38:11.872
or else everything will fall apart.

38:14.542 --> 38:18.671
The YSD, it…
it helps you conceal your weakness,

38:18.754 --> 38:22.049
but it's just a Band-Aid. You…

38:23.259 --> 38:24.635
you're not okay, Doctor.

38:24.719 --> 38:29.932
And pretending that you are is only
hurting the ones that depend on you.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.895
You can still save
one last patient, Doctor.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.148
All you have to do is…

38:38.566 --> 38:40.026
just put down the scalpel.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.113
Please put it down.

39:09.972 --> 39:10.848
Oh, thank you.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.437
[chuckles] Enjoy.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.069
So, why are you running away?

39:24.320 --> 39:25.363
I've been having…

39:27.198 --> 39:28.115
trouble lately.

39:29.575 --> 39:31.285
I haven't been feeling like myself.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.913
Getting confused, losing things.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.582
And now my children are mad at me.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.459
Can't say I blame them.

39:39.627 --> 39:43.339
Honestly,
I think I may have really messed up.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.052
I guess everyone makes mistakes.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.388
Even grown-ups.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.056
What a wise observation.

39:52.139 --> 39:53.557
What about you, Trixie?

39:54.517 --> 39:56.185
What are you doing so far from home?

39:58.187 --> 40:00.398
I realized I'm mad at Lucifer.

40:02.566 --> 40:07.029
I've actually been mad
at him for a while, but I had denial.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.573
Happens to the best of us.

40:12.785 --> 40:13.828
Why are you mad at him?

40:14.412 --> 40:17.206
Well, I-- I thought we were friends…

40:18.082 --> 40:20.418
but then he just ran off
to Florida for months,

40:20.501 --> 40:21.919
and he didn't even say goodbye.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.381
He always just does whatever he wants.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.675
And now…

40:29.260 --> 40:30.970
I don't know what he's doing now.

40:31.554 --> 40:35.266
But I know it's making my mom really sad.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.938
You know I'm Lucifer's dad, right?

40:42.648 --> 40:45.693
Well, some of the ways he acts…

40:46.694 --> 40:48.154
I think they may be my fault.

40:49.363 --> 40:54.034
As a father, I tried to give my children
just the right amount of free will…

40:54.952 --> 40:59.457
the right amount
of responsibility, consequence.

41:02.084 --> 41:04.295
Looking back at how I raised Lucifer…

41:07.506 --> 41:10.551
Hmm, I'm not sure I got it all right.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.472
I've never been a parent before,

41:15.473 --> 41:17.016
but it seems like a tough job.

41:17.099 --> 41:19.602
Hmm. I've never been a kid.

41:21.061 --> 41:25.191
-But I bet that's not so easy either.
-[both chuckle]

41:27.943 --> 41:29.945
[both laugh]

41:45.085 --> 41:46.295
I think it's time to go home.

41:47.963 --> 41:48.797
Home.

41:49.590 --> 41:51.842
Trixie. Ha-ha!

41:51.926 --> 41:52.885
You're a genius.

41:52.968 --> 41:55.346
You just reminded me
where I left something.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.973
[laughs]

42:00.935 --> 42:05.064
He's not at the doughnut shop,
the zoo or the Gas 'n' Grub. [scoffs]

42:05.147 --> 42:06.524
Have you checked the park?

42:06.607 --> 42:08.817
Of course I checked the park.
I'm not an idiot!

42:08.901 --> 42:12.446
-[sighs] Well, I mean, you did lose Dad.
-He was gone when I arrived.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.990
What part
of "united front" do you not understand?

42:15.074 --> 42:17.034
If we just forced Dad
to confront his issues--

42:17.117 --> 42:19.161
I'm not forcing Dad to do anything, Lucy!

42:19.912 --> 42:21.413
He's our father, all right?

42:21.497 --> 42:23.040
God Almighty!

42:23.958 --> 42:27.253
And you really should start
showing him a little bit more respect.

42:27.336 --> 42:30.297
He is an old man
who has lost control of his powers,

42:30.381 --> 42:33.842
and now he's out there
somewhere lost and alone and afraid!

42:35.928 --> 42:36.845
He's afraid.

42:38.347 --> 42:39.473
[God] Who's afraid?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.060
[Lucifer] Dad! Where have you…

42:43.143 --> 42:44.895
You can't just run off like that!

42:44.979 --> 42:46.981
Do you have any idea
what you put us through?

42:47.565 --> 42:49.483
I'm starting to think I do, actually.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.068
[door opens]

42:51.694 --> 42:54.863
But not to worry,
everything's going to be just fine.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.867
[Lucifer] I hope by "fine"
you mean you've managed to locate

42:58.951 --> 43:00.953
the power to create
and destroy the universe,

43:01.036 --> 43:04.039
that you lost because
you were busy drinking a Gulpee.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.207
I'm sorry, what?

43:05.291 --> 43:06.292
[Lucifer sighs]

43:06.375 --> 43:09.295
Well, I have remembered
where I put my powers, yes.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.798
Thank you
for holding onto this for me, Charlie.

43:14.508 --> 43:16.468
I knew it would be safe with family.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.517
[chiming intensifies]

43:23.601 --> 43:24.935
[whooshing]

43:37.448 --> 43:38.365
[exhales]

43:40.951 --> 43:41.994
[coos]

43:42.077 --> 43:43.120
What just happened?

43:43.203 --> 43:46.332
[dance music playing]

43:56.091 --> 43:56.925
Yo.

43:57.509 --> 43:58.344
What's up?

43:58.427 --> 43:59.678
Rough day?

44:01.972 --> 44:04.350
Couldn't kill God. You?

44:05.392 --> 44:08.646
I think… God killed me.

44:10.856 --> 44:13.400
-We're gonna need more drinks.
-[Mazikeen] Yeah.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.656
[sighs]

44:18.739 --> 44:20.532
[God] Thank you for not killing me.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.079
[exhales]

44:25.162 --> 44:29.291
I didn't want Trixie
to see that kind of violence.

44:30.292 --> 44:33.462
You were following me
for quite a while before Trixie showed up.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.966
Mazikeen, you chose not to kill me.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.220
Fine.

44:41.303 --> 44:44.390
You created me to be a killer,
and I can't even do that right.

44:45.516 --> 44:48.352
"Perfect the way I am,"
my demon ass.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.690
The funny thing about miracles…

44:54.900 --> 44:56.276
is they happen every day.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.363
An angel has a child with a human.

44:59.446 --> 45:01.323
The Devil can fall in love.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.326
We can all learn.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.495
And we can all grow.

45:10.582 --> 45:12.543
But a demon can't grow a soul.

45:14.670 --> 45:15.546
Can't she?

45:22.886 --> 45:24.012
[gasps]

45:25.472 --> 45:26.598
[exhales]

45:29.852 --> 45:30.686
[exhales]

45:32.354 --> 45:35.107
-[Dan groans] Oh!
-[liquid spills]

45:41.029 --> 45:41.989
You know what?

45:44.575 --> 45:45.784
I slept with your wife,

45:46.785 --> 45:49.663
and I can't change that,
even if I wanted to.

45:51.707 --> 45:52.541
Which I don't.

45:54.084 --> 45:55.169
So smite me.

45:56.211 --> 45:58.088
Turn me into a pillar of salt.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.381
Whatever you do.

46:00.883 --> 46:03.761
[laughs] Let's just get it over with.

46:04.344 --> 46:07.514
It's not my business who
my ex-wife spent her time with, Daniel.

46:08.474 --> 46:11.101
The truth is, I wasn't the best husband,

46:11.185 --> 46:15.022
and I'm grateful she found someone
to give her the love she deserved.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.024
Thank you.

46:21.028 --> 46:24.406
-[exhales]
-[laughs]

46:37.669 --> 46:42.966
Um, Trix, there are, uh,
some things that we need to talk about.

46:44.051 --> 46:44.968
It's okay, Mom.

46:45.052 --> 46:48.096
I learned today
that grown-ups make mistakes too.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.641
And I forgive you.

46:52.309 --> 46:53.185
Oh.

46:54.102 --> 46:56.063
Well, that is nice of you to say.

46:56.146 --> 46:57.314
And, um, you're right,

46:58.357 --> 47:01.485
you know, everybody does make mistakes,

47:02.402 --> 47:06.365
but it's important that we own up
to our mistakes when we make them.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.784
I'm sorry for what I did at school.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.369
I'm glad to hear you say that.

47:12.454 --> 47:16.291
You know, I'm sorry too,
for my mistakes and, um…

47:17.334 --> 47:21.255
I really should have realized
that you're not a little kid anymore.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.008
You're beautiful, smart--

47:25.092 --> 47:26.802
I can tell you're sad, Mom.

47:29.847 --> 47:30.806
I know you can.

47:33.600 --> 47:38.313
Even when I'm not willing
to admit it to myself. I know, honey.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.314
Denial.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.900
It happens to the best of us.

47:41.984 --> 47:44.194
[laughs]

47:44.278 --> 47:45.112
Yes.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.072
You're right.

47:47.155 --> 47:48.782
[sighs] You're so smart.

47:49.324 --> 47:52.369
You know, when you were younger, I…

47:52.452 --> 47:58.083
I tried to protect you,
to shield you from difficult feelings,

47:58.750 --> 48:00.085
and situations.

48:00.752 --> 48:06.967
But I think now, maybe, the best thing
that I can do for you is to let you in

48:07.050 --> 48:09.219
and, um, and admit that…

48:10.596 --> 48:13.307
Mom doesn't always feel so strong inside.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.143
You're upset about Lucifer.

48:17.019 --> 48:17.895
Aren't you?

48:22.065 --> 48:23.191
[smacks lips]

48:23.942 --> 48:24.776
Well…

48:26.403 --> 48:28.030
the truth is, is, um…

48:29.406 --> 48:31.909
things between Lucifer and me,

48:31.992 --> 48:34.620
they are a little up in the air right now.

48:35.454 --> 48:40.834
And, uh, I'm not sure
if we will, uh, end up as partners

48:41.418 --> 48:44.254
or friends, or something more,

48:44.338 --> 48:48.300
but, uh, if he and I
are gonna try and figure this out…

48:50.969 --> 48:53.388
I have to tell him my real feelings.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.349
And then what's gonna happen?

48:56.141 --> 48:57.184
[exhales]

48:58.602 --> 48:59.645
[sighs]

49:04.191 --> 49:05.233
I don't know.

49:07.361 --> 49:09.863
And that's a little scary.

49:11.698 --> 49:14.242
And I'm sure
it's scary for you too, right?

49:19.247 --> 49:20.999
But here's the thing, Trix.

49:21.792 --> 49:25.379
No matter what happens,
and no matter if you're 11…

49:26.588 --> 49:28.340
or 111…

49:29.174 --> 49:34.805
if the Earth gets hit by
an asteroid made of rock candy

49:34.888 --> 49:37.849
and the sky starts raining down gumdrops…

49:40.060 --> 49:43.730
me and your dad
will always be your parents.

49:44.690 --> 49:47.275
And we will always love you,
no matter what.

49:48.819 --> 49:49.653
Promise?

49:51.613 --> 49:52.447
Promise.

50:04.626 --> 50:05.794
[glasses clink]

50:05.877 --> 50:07.170
I will miss the buzz.

50:07.963 --> 50:11.466
You're all-powerful again, Dad,
so can't you just buzz yourself?

50:12.300 --> 50:14.511
[chuckles] We need to talk.

50:17.889 --> 50:18.890
[sighs]

50:22.978 --> 50:23.895
Okay.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.314
Father, what is it?

50:26.398 --> 50:27.566
Lucifer was right.

50:28.483 --> 50:31.862
Twice in one millennium.
Will wonders never cease?

50:33.071 --> 50:34.573
[God] It's not just the music.

50:35.866 --> 50:38.785
Or the fact that I misplaced my powers.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.496
The truth is,

50:41.580 --> 50:43.790
I've been slipping for quite a while.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.502
For longer than I'd like to admit.

50:49.504 --> 50:51.506
I guess you get
your denial from your father.

50:51.590 --> 50:52.799
What denial?

50:53.759 --> 50:55.969
[chuckles] Kidding.

50:56.053 --> 50:56.928
Mostly.

50:58.472 --> 51:02.768
Now, let's just keep this between
the three of us, for now. Shall we?

51:02.851 --> 51:04.770
Father, what are you saying?

51:04.853 --> 51:06.396
I think it's time.

51:07.314 --> 51:08.690
Time for what?

51:10.358 --> 51:11.693
Time for me to retire.

51:18.241 --> 51:19.534
-Dad.
-Dad, uh…
