01:34.460 --> 01:38.590
- You didn't say there'd be such security.
- They moved the flight forward.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.840
We'll have to go ahead as planned anyway.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.810
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

01:44.970 --> 01:47.270
James.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.770
Be careful.

03:03.630 --> 03:06.720
Well, small world. You're a Toro, too.

04:33.890 --> 04:36.390
I'll see you in Miami.

07:25.730 --> 07:26.940
Fill her up.

10:24.400 --> 10:28.320
EAST BERLIN

12:59.640 --> 13:02.850
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

13:02.980 --> 13:06.190
We should go, my dear.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.010
Well...

13:31.170 --> 13:34.090
You become more beautiful every day.

13:34.260 --> 13:37.090
- I'm over here.
- Of course you are.

13:37.260 --> 13:40.600
This is Miss Penelope
Smallbone, my new assistant.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.560
Miss Smallbone.

13:42.680 --> 13:48.230
What can I say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...

13:48.360 --> 13:50.730
- As I used to be?
- I didn't say that.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.190
You're such a flatterer, James.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.990
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.910
So you've told me.

14:01.790 --> 14:04.830
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.750
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.800
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.550
In nauseating detail.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.630
Really?

14:17.800 --> 14:21.350
I can see you're going to
fit in here very nicely.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.190
- Good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.

14:28.310 --> 14:30.150
- Minister.
- Commander.

14:30.310 --> 14:33.190
I think you know Jim
Fanning, our art expert.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.360
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.

14:35.490 --> 14:39.280
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a Faberge egg, sir.

14:39.410 --> 14:43.660
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Faberg
as a gift for the Russian royal family.

14:44.580 --> 14:47.830
They're priceless and very rare.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.420
This one contains a model of
the imperial state coach.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.380
- Top marks, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.670
Except it's a fake.

14:55.840 --> 14:59.890
There's the real thing. It's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

15:00.010 --> 15:02.890
This is the fourth egg to
turn up at auction this year.

15:03.010 --> 15:07.890
It's from none of the usual sources.
Anonymous seller, Swiss bank account.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.690
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

15:11.860 --> 15:16.440
And now this turns up. A
near-perfect forgery.

15:16.610 --> 15:19.610
I think Commander Bond should
accompany you to the sale.

15:19.780 --> 15:23.030
Splendid. I could use
an extra pair of eyes.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.200
We could try and spot the seller.

15:25.370 --> 15:29.910
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.250
Thank you, Fanning.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.420
Not at all.

15:36.550 --> 15:40.010
If it is the Russians, it may
be an effort to raise currency

15:40.130 --> 15:43.050
for covert operations
abroad or for payoffs.

15:43.220 --> 15:46.850
Either way, we'd better find
out what they're up to.

15:46.970 --> 15:49.810
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.270
Operation Trove.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.610
You'll be replacing 009.

15:54.730 --> 15:59.570
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.820
There's not much to go on.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.320
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

16:04.910 --> 16:07.080
"Property of a Lady."

16:07.660 --> 16:12.870
Next on the agenda is the continuing
mutual disarmament talks with NATO.

16:13.420 --> 16:16.540
I assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.

16:17.340 --> 16:20.550
It seems very thorough.

16:20.670 --> 16:23.180
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

16:23.340 --> 16:27.180
I believe I express the
opinion of everyone present

16:27.350 --> 16:33.690
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.

16:35.270 --> 16:39.230
- Comrade Chairman.
- General Orlov.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.400
General Gogol is presumptuous.

16:42.530 --> 16:45.360
He speaks for himself and others

16:45.530 --> 16:52.500
who cling to timid, outdated
and unrealistic policies.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.960
Must I remind you, the committee,

16:56.130 --> 17:01.170
of our overwhelming
superiority over NATO forces

17:01.300 --> 17:03.970
before we give it away?

17:13.230 --> 17:16.190
In East Germany under my direct command,

17:16.310 --> 17:21.980
I have 31 divisions,
including 11 tank divisions

17:22.150 --> 17:24.950
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

17:25.069 --> 17:30.030
In support, on the Russian
western border are 60 divisions,

17:30.160 --> 17:33.790
including 22 tank divisions.

17:33.910 --> 17:37.580
In all, a 10-1 advantage.

17:39.250 --> 17:45.630
American and West German forces can
field at most ten armoured divisions.

17:45.760 --> 17:50.390
The British maintain only a token force.

17:51.430 --> 17:56.230
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

17:56.350 --> 18:02.770
and find that a lightning thrust by ten
armoured divisions from the north,

18:02.940 --> 18:10.240
and by five more through Czechoslovakia,
lead to total victory in five days

18:10.370 --> 18:14.540
against any possible defence scenario.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.790
This is absolute madness.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.750
We know where it will end.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.750
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.300
Never.

18:25.460 --> 18:28.970
The West is decadent and divided.

18:29.130 --> 18:32.760
It has no stomach to risk
our atomic reprisals.

18:33.390 --> 18:39.100
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

18:39.230 --> 18:41.600
I see no reason to risk war

18:41.730 --> 18:46.610
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.

18:47.990 --> 18:51.200
We must turn our energies to
pressing domestic problems.

18:51.320 --> 18:55.030
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.290
- I wish to tell you...
- Both of you.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.250
World socialism will be achieved peaceably.

19:03.420 --> 19:06.500
Our military role is strictly defensive.

19:06.670 --> 19:09.510
Is that understood, General Orlov?

19:13.680 --> 19:16.350
General Gogol, would you continue?

19:17.770 --> 19:22.900
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will now
turn to the specifics of my report...

19:23.020 --> 19:26.770
Tell him I will be there
as quickly as possible.

19:30.700 --> 19:35.640
KREMLINARTREPOSITORY

19:43.870 --> 19:46.090
Please. Please.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.670
- I am trying to concentrate.
- Lenkin.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.720
- What is it?
- It's terrible news, Comrade General.

19:54.890 --> 19:58.350
The reproduction has
been stolen in transit.

19:58.470 --> 20:02.180
The thief was dealt with, but
the egg was lost in the river.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.940
Your incompetence will destroy us all.

20:07.060 --> 20:10.820
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General.

20:10.990 --> 20:14.910
I have just been informed of an
unscheduled inventory in two days.

20:15.070 --> 20:16.870
Control yourself.

20:16.990 --> 20:21.540
I'll tell our London people we
must have the genuine egg back.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.170
I hope we can reach them in time.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.630
Sold to Busoni.

20:33.260 --> 20:36.180
The next lot is number 48.

20:36.340 --> 20:40.220
A superb green-gold imperial
Easter egg by Carl Faberge.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.730
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

20:44.850 --> 20:49.020
Set with blue sapphires and four
petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

20:49.150 --> 20:54.700
- How much should it fetch?
- 50-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.

20:54.860 --> 20:58.240
Used by Tsar Nicholas in 1897 in Moscow.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.990
Property of a Lady.

21:01.370 --> 21:04.500
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

21:04.620 --> 21:08.670
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.

21:08.790 --> 21:12.460
I'll start it at 50,000.

21:13.550 --> 21:15.840
150, 60.

21:16.220 --> 21:18.800
170. 170.

21:20.550 --> 21:23.010
180, 190.

21:23.890 --> 21:26.810
200. Against you, madam.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.650
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.

21:29.730 --> 21:31.860
20,000.

21:31.980 --> 21:33.650
240.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.320
James, stick to the business in hand.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.200
60,000.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.990
280000

21:41.160 --> 21:43.120
300,000.

21:43.910 --> 21:45.370
And 20?

21:52.590 --> 21:54.880
Are you bidding, sir?

21:56.170 --> 21:59.340
320,000. New bidder.

21:59.840 --> 22:03.180
- That's interesting.
- You know him?

22:03.300 --> 22:06.560
Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.770
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

22:09.940 --> 22:12.730
380,000.

22:12.860 --> 22:16.610
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.

22:16.730 --> 22:20.200
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.

22:21.030 --> 22:23.030
400,000. Any more?

22:23.870 --> 22:26.620
425. New bidder.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.790
Thank you, sir.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.380
- 425.
- Have you gone mad?

22:34.290 --> 22:36.500
Let's see how badly he wants it.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.880
450?

22:40.840 --> 22:42.720
450. 475?

22:44.550 --> 22:47.060
The bid is 450. 475?

22:53.900 --> 22:57.650
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

22:58.820 --> 23:03.160
- Jim?
- The bid is?50,000.

23:04.570 --> 23:06.660
I have 475.

23:09.910 --> 23:13.420
500,000.

23:14.580 --> 23:17.710
I have half a million pounds. All done?

23:19.340 --> 23:21.340
Any more?

23:23.340 --> 23:26.100
Yours, sir, for 500,000.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.220
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.

23:30.350 --> 23:33.730
- I doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?

23:33.850 --> 23:36.690
That's what I intend to find out.

24:11.390 --> 24:14.770
You had no business bidding for that egg.

24:14.890 --> 24:17.230
What would you have done if you'd got it?

24:17.400 --> 24:21.190
I would have claimed it was
a fake, sir, and not paid.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.190
Not paid?

24:23.320 --> 24:27.820
Here's the original. I switched it
with the fake during the auction.

24:27.990 --> 24:29.990
Good God.

24:31.830 --> 24:34.500
And what happens when the
buyer discovers that?

24:34.660 --> 24:38.630
Well, he complains. If he's legitimate.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.040
- Well?
- I don't think he will complain.

24:41.170 --> 24:45.090
According to Fanning, this Kamal
usually sells. Now he buys.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.800
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.

24:47.930 --> 24:52.310
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he caught a plane to Delhi.

24:52.430 --> 24:54.470
You must go there, too.

24:54.600 --> 24:59.020
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station
I, to keep him under surveillance.

24:59.190 --> 25:03.610
- Book yourself on the next flight out.
- Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

25:04.940 --> 25:07.110
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?

25:07.280 --> 25:12.370
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
It's government property now.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.620
Of course, sir.

26:23.940 --> 26:26.860
Charming tune. You do take English money?

26:27.020 --> 26:29.150
Only gold sovereigns.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.320
Please.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.320
I'm Vijay. Special expediter,
Universal Exports.

26:35.450 --> 26:38.240
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.

26:38.370 --> 26:41.540
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Waiting in the taxi.

26:41.710 --> 26:44.710
This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.540
Taxi. Please be comfortable.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.590
- I am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?

26:53.720 --> 26:56.760
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?

26:56.890 --> 26:58.930
Gone ahead.

27:04.310 --> 27:06.730
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

27:06.900 --> 27:10.940
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman, polo, cricket, tennis.

27:11.070 --> 27:12.940
- I play a bit myself.
- Really?

27:13.070 --> 27:17.490
As a matter of fact, I've got a
part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

27:17.660 --> 27:21.080
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.130
Kamal lives there on the hill.

27:29.250 --> 27:32.880
The Monsoon Palace. It's heavily guarded.

27:33.010 --> 27:38.090
- How do I get to him?
- He plays backgammon at the hotel.

27:38.260 --> 27:40.970
As a guest, you're automatically a member.

27:41.100 --> 27:45.980
- Let's meet there later.
- I'll change into something less casual.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.400
Here, you may need this
to play with your asp.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.920
Good morning. Name's Bond. I
believe you have a reservation.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.130
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.

28:10.290 --> 28:12.300
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.130
I'm sure I will.

28:18.970 --> 28:21.010
Thank you.

28:22.640 --> 28:25.100
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

28:26.310 --> 28:30.150
- Oh, thank you.
- If I can be of further assistance...

28:31.310 --> 28:34.190
- Anything at all?
- Maybe later.

29:28.290 --> 29:30.710
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.

29:30.870 --> 29:35.840
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating this.

29:36.880 --> 29:40.010
I feel lucky. Shall we double?

29:41.300 --> 29:43.340
Of course.

29:43.470 --> 29:46.140
20,000 rupees.

29:50.390 --> 29:53.770
- Always a double six when you need it.
- Always.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.690
- How do you do it.
- It's all in the wrist.

29:56.820 --> 30:00.110
- It's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?

30:00.240 --> 30:02.780
- Same stake?
- Yes, I'll have another go.

30:02.910 --> 30:05.990
Your luck's got to run out some time.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.830
May I join you?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.880
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

30:18.670 --> 30:22.340
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.

30:22.510 --> 30:24.720
You have a good memory for faces.

30:25.180 --> 30:27.180
And figures.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.890
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.

30:32.020 --> 30:35.480
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.060
Some other time, perhaps?

30:39.520 --> 30:41.530
Thank you.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.990
Six and one.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.700
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.

30:54.290 --> 31:00.420
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 100,000 rupees.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.590
I can't accept. Not with your luck.

31:07.890 --> 31:09.600
You win.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.720
I would have taken that double, myself.

31:13.980 --> 31:18.650
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?

31:18.810 --> 31:20.610
Bond.

31:20.730 --> 31:23.860
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.

31:24.820 --> 31:27.490
100,000 rupees, then.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.200
Double six.

31:32.330 --> 31:35.370
Not such a good double to
accept, after all, was it?

31:45.260 --> 31:48.090
- Double.
- Of course.

31:48.260 --> 31:50.850
You can only win with a double six.

31:51.010 --> 31:56.180
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?

31:59.940 --> 32:04.400
Well, I think that this
should be ample security.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.070
Don't you?

32:14.540 --> 32:17.000
Play, Mr Bond.

32:17.620 --> 32:21.170
You'll need a great deal of
luck to get out of this.

32:21.290 --> 32:23.090
Oh, luck?

32:23.210 --> 32:27.090
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,

32:27.210 --> 32:30.380
and use your lucky dice.

32:31.300 --> 32:33.350
It's all in the wrist.

32:36.140 --> 32:38.180
Double sixes.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.730
Fancy that.

32:40.890 --> 32:42.900
200,000 rupees.

32:51.660 --> 32:54.370
I prefer cash.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.290
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.

33:03.750 --> 33:07.750
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.760
I intend to, Kamal Khan.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.720
My security.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.350
And yours?

33:36.700 --> 33:39.120
It's not really in the wrist, you know.

33:45.960 --> 33:51.010
- Should I be following them?
- Yes, but I think they'll be following this.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.380
Thank you.

33:52.550 --> 33:57.140
Vijay will take you from here. I'll see
if I can find out more about Kamal.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.310
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

34:01.140 --> 34:04.020
Keep you in curry for a
few weeks, won't it?

34:04.140 --> 34:07.770
Thank you. It's a wonderful racket, this.

34:40.010 --> 34:43.469
- Vijay, we have company.
- No problem. This is a company car.

34:56.949 --> 34:59.320
Step on it.

35:00.030 --> 35:02.580
This should shake 'em off.

35:39.450 --> 35:42.410
Thank God for hard currency.

35:51.420 --> 35:54.000
Game, set and match. Hang on, James.

36:16.530 --> 36:18.940
Keep your head down.

36:27.910 --> 36:29.910
Thank you.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.490
Get off my bed.

37:13.790 --> 37:15.750
Here. Catch.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.170
Excuse me.

37:32.600 --> 37:36.310
Thank you. You'd better
stick this back yourself.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.900
James, over here. Come on.

37:58.460 --> 38:01.250
Vijay. The money I gave you.

38:04.300 --> 38:06.720
Here. Rupees!

38:09.140 --> 38:11.180
Easy come, easy go.

38:35.910 --> 38:38.420
It pays to advertise.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.580
This way, James.

38:52.180 --> 38:54.180
Ah, Q.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.270
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.440
How can I be expected to
maintain the quality of my work?

39:01.610 --> 39:04.360
Sent out here at a moment's notice.

39:04.530 --> 39:08.700
Have you any smaller thread? Someone
stuck a knife in my wallet.

39:08.860 --> 39:11.280
Pity they missed you.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.990
Karen, see to that, will you?

39:14.120 --> 39:17.410
I've also mislaid my PPK.

39:17.540 --> 39:20.370
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

39:28.050 --> 39:29.840
Blast.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.760
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

39:32.890 --> 39:34.930
Experimental model.

39:39.140 --> 39:41.140
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.

39:47.860 --> 39:51.030
- Smashing, Q.
- Come on. I have a few things for you.

39:51.150 --> 39:53.070
Very nice, Smithers.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.410
Is the homing device ready yet?

39:56.580 --> 40:02.000
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone as well.

40:02.710 --> 40:05.170
It goes in there like that.

40:05.340 --> 40:07.920
Now, take a fountain pen.

40:08.090 --> 40:10.760
Twist the top,

40:10.840 --> 40:15.100
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

40:15.600 --> 40:19.770
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters.

40:19.930 --> 40:22.390
Pay attention, 007.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.560
Pull the top off the pen.

40:24.690 --> 40:28.690
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.

40:28.860 --> 40:35.280
The homing device is compatible with the
radio directional finder in your watch.

40:35.450 --> 40:37.660
If you haven't lost it.

40:43.370 --> 40:45.790
That's amazing, Q. It does work.

40:46.750 --> 40:48.880
What's that?

40:49.050 --> 40:52.550
That's the latest liquid-crystal TV.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.680
Very handy.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.070
Perfect image, Q.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.070
Really, 007.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.990
Look, I haven't time for
these adolescent antics.

41:20.660 --> 41:23.790
- It's the best we can do.
- It's beautiful. Thank you.

41:23.910 --> 41:27.380
Go on, get along. I've got my work to do.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.630
- I'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.

41:29.790 --> 41:31.550
Don't forget this.

41:31.670 --> 41:35.470
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits.

41:50.110 --> 41:52.780
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

41:52.940 --> 41:56.490
- I didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.

41:56.610 --> 41:58.450
This way, please.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.120
Thank you.

42:05.450 --> 42:07.960
You changed your mind.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.580
- I'm glad.
- Are you?

42:10.710 --> 42:13.050
Well, let's put it this way.

42:13.210 --> 42:19.260
So far, you are the least lethal and by
far the prettiest of Kamal's friends.

42:19.380 --> 42:21.220
Thank you.

42:21.390 --> 42:24.930
So does he have a proposition
for me, or do you?

42:26.980 --> 42:29.190
He suggests a trade.

42:29.310 --> 42:32.610
The egg for your life.

42:33.570 --> 42:37.900
I'd heard the price of eggs was going
up, but isn't that a little high?

42:38.820 --> 42:41.240
Charge it to Room...?

42:41.990 --> 42:45.200
Oh, 27. Along with the
champagne, I suppose?

42:45.370 --> 42:47.620
I'll leave it at the desk.

42:48.580 --> 42:50.460
You don't mind?

42:50.580 --> 42:54.250
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what I look like already?

42:54.420 --> 42:56.630
It's for me.

42:57.630 --> 42:59.930
So that if I depart this world suddenly,

43:00.090 --> 43:04.010
you'll have something to remember me by?

43:04.140 --> 43:06.390
Something like that.

43:06.520 --> 43:11.850
It's for my scrapbook. I collect memories.

43:14.690 --> 43:17.980
Well, let's get on with making a few.

43:44.970 --> 43:47.720
I need refilling.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.810
Of course you do.

43:55.650 --> 43:57.900
I'll get some more.

43:58.070 --> 44:01.610
Don't bother. We'll make
yours a loving cup.

44:02.990 --> 44:05.240
What a good idea.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.830
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.420
That's my little octopussy.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.190
Good morning.

45:20.310 --> 45:22.230
Morning.

45:22.400 --> 45:25.900
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,

45:26.070 --> 45:29.110
I can say a proper goodbye.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.120
What is the time?

45:44.090 --> 45:46.300
Beautiful view, isn't it?

45:51.010 --> 45:55.140
- I don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.

45:55.270 --> 45:56.680
So right.

46:29.630 --> 46:33.890
In. Out. In. Out.

46:37.310 --> 46:41.310
Come on, girls. In. Out.

46:46.070 --> 46:48.110
Check oars.

48:01.970 --> 48:04.640
The egg has been recovered.

48:06.480 --> 48:08.190
You should be pleased.

48:08.310 --> 48:11.820
I'm not pleased it was
stolen in the first place.

48:11.980 --> 48:14.820
Nor that the thief knows
enough to bring it here.

48:14.990 --> 48:19.370
He's obviously an adventurer with
possible blackmail on his mind.

48:19.490 --> 48:23.410
Anyway, I have him as my
guest at the Monsoon Palace.

48:23.580 --> 48:27.000
And he will tell us all
he knows very quickly.

48:28.250 --> 48:30.790
- Who is he?
- Englishman.

48:30.920 --> 48:34.630
Likes eggs. Preferably Faberg?

48:34.760 --> 48:37.510
And dice. Preferably loaded.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.890
His name is James Bond.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.600
Bring him here.

48:43.770 --> 48:48.100
He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.

48:49.940 --> 48:51.730
No.

48:53.280 --> 48:56.650
A "no" from you has little
chance of becoming a "yes".

48:56.780 --> 48:59.780
I assume, therefore, that
the meeting is over.

48:59.950 --> 49:03.160
But you're making a serious mistake.

50:26.870 --> 50:30.410
Well, so far I can't complain
about the valet service.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.500
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

51:03.820 --> 51:06.780
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.

51:06.910 --> 51:08.740
Well rested?

51:08.910 --> 51:12.120
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.

51:14.670 --> 51:18.420
- It was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.420
You don't mind if we start?
The souffle can't wait.

51:27.760 --> 51:31.560
At the risk of appearing to be
making light dinner conversation,

51:31.680 --> 51:34.310
may I ask exactly why I am here?

51:34.440 --> 51:37.440
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.

51:37.770 --> 51:40.980
True. But we don't have all the answers.

51:42.360 --> 51:46.660
Well, supposing, for argument's
sake, I don't feel like talking?

51:46.780 --> 51:50.280
Don't worry, you will.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.830
Let me guess.

51:53.950 --> 51:56.370
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

51:56.540 --> 52:00.000
Hardly. We're much more
sophisticated than that.

52:02.800 --> 52:07.800
- Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.

52:07.970 --> 52:13.100
We prefer curare with an
effective psychedelic compound.

52:13.220 --> 52:15.480
Guaranteed results.

52:15.640 --> 52:19.980
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.

52:21.650 --> 52:24.780
One of our specialities.

52:26.900 --> 52:29.780
Stuffed sheep's head.

52:34.910 --> 52:40.380
It's odd, but when I'm stared
at I seem to lose my appetite.

52:56.680 --> 52:59.100
Oh, thank you for dinner.

53:00.350 --> 53:02.360
Until tomorrow, then.

53:08.780 --> 53:13.070
- Well, I'll say good night.
- I could come in for a nightcap.

53:15.120 --> 53:17.830
Some other time, perhaps.

53:23.790 --> 53:28.260
I don't suppose you'd
care for a nightcap? No.

55:51.940 --> 55:54.690
I trust you had a pleasant flight.

55:57.450 --> 56:01.620
If you step this way, I think you
will find everything is in order.

56:36.150 --> 56:40.360
Congratulations on the quality
of your workmanship, Kamal Khan.

56:41.240 --> 56:42.820
Thank you, General Orlov.

56:42.990 --> 56:47.200
As you can see, each piece has
been meticulously duplicated

56:47.330 --> 56:50.620
according to Lenkin's specifications.

56:51.500 --> 56:54.790
Good. Have it put aboard the helicopter.

56:59.840 --> 57:03.930
- Can they be trusted?
- I assure you of their silence.

57:08.930 --> 57:11.560
We are both playing for enormous stakes.

57:11.690 --> 57:17.270
I get what I want, then you
get the genuine jewellery.

57:17.690 --> 57:19.490
Exactly...

57:40.630 --> 57:43.680
The precise timing will be essential.

57:45.470 --> 57:47.930
Remember: Nothing must be changed.

57:51.980 --> 57:56.860
One week from today, in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

57:57.730 --> 58:00.400
- Karl-Marx-Stadt.
- Correct.

58:18.920 --> 58:22.840
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.

58:24.930 --> 58:28.720
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice of the thief.

58:28.850 --> 58:32.020
He must be eliminated at once.

58:33.600 --> 58:36.730
There must be no further security breach.

58:36.850 --> 58:40.150
This fake has caused enough trouble.

58:44.550 --> 58:46.880
I must go.

58:56.140 --> 58:58.850
Everything has been most satisfactory.

58:58.980 --> 59:01.100
Most kind, General Orlov.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.940
Get Bond.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.170
The Englishman has escaped.

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:12.300
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:40.090
Good.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.600
Let the sport commence.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.810
Head him off.

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:40.400
Sit!

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.710
We have him.

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:53.960
Go round. He's in there.

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:31.540
Hiss off.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.710
Don't let him get away.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.540
C'mom, buddy, c'mon.

01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:41.080
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:45.550
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.510
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.220
Soon to be made extinct.

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:08.230
Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venom
that's invariably fatal in seconds.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.070
The barge had that sign.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.990
It belongs to a wealthy woman who
lives on the floating palace.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.530
Who?

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.290
No one knows her real name,
but she's known as Octopussy.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.620
That's the name I heard at Kamal's.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:28.090
I hear that island's full of beautiful women.
No men allowed.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:31.300
Really? Sexual discrimination.

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:34.430
I'll definitely have to pay it a visit.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:07.230
Good evening.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.810
I wondered when you might arrive.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.320
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.820
And you are James Bond.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.450
007, licensed to kill.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:21.660
Am I to be your target for tonight?

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.120
Not necessarily.

01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:29.710
Depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.790
And why one of our agents
was killed in East Berlin.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.960
I know nothing about that.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.630
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.890
You were sent out to
arrest him, weren't you?

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.600
You seem to have done your homework.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:50.229
Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliant
military career, joined our secret service.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:55.279
His mission was to recover a cache of
Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:58.240
Both he and his native guide disappeared.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.910
The gold was never found.

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:04.740
And 20 years later you were sent after him.

01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:12.290
The guide's body turned up with a bullet
still in his skull from Smythe's revolver.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.880
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.130
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before I took him back.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:23.470
He committed suicide rather than face
the disgrace of a court martial.

01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:25.850
What's the connection?

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.149
He was my father. I'd hoped fate
would bring us together one day.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:35.399
To avenge him?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.240
To thank you for giving him
an honourable alternative.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.330
Come in.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.540
Kamal Khan to see you.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:55.330
Bond has escaped.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.550
- How careless of you.
- I apologise.

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.130
By the way, I'd like you to
meet my new house guest.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.760
An old friend of the family, you might say.

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:08.760
How lovely.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:12.640
You have a nasty habit of surviving.

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.100
You know what they say about the fittest.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:22.320
Octopussy, I'd enjoy another opportunity
to take care of Mr Bond personally.

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:25.280
I will take care of Mr Bond myself.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:29.490
Good night.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.620
And enjoy yourselves.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.420
Mr Bond.

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:46.890
My father became a leading
authority on octopi.

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:50.510
He loved them. His pet
name for me was Octopussy.

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:59.020
Mr Bond, smuggling is no
concern of the secret service.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.980
I've violated no British law.

01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:06.700
You are free to leave, but I'd much prefer
if you stayed as my guest for a few days.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.780
I'd like that.

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:14.410
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.710
Good night, Mr Bond.

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:20.920
Till the morning, then.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:27.430
Midge.

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:32.720
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy, but
double the guard on his quarters.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.660
He says the island is heavily guarded.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.250
We don't want to make
enemies with the woman.

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:30.070
The woman must not be harmed.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.050
When Father's gold ran out, the people in
Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.430
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.690
I discovered I had a talent for it.

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.900
You went into business for yourself?

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.400
Yes, but I needed an organisation,
so I revived the old Octopus cult.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:12.200
Well, then. Where did you
recruit all these lovelies?

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.990
There are many of them
all over Southeast Asia,

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.660
looking for a guru, spiritual
discipline, who knows what.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:25.080
I train them. Give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of life.

01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:27.840
- In crime?
- In business.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.340
I have diversified into shipping,
hotels, carnivals and circuses.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.430
- Is he still there?
- You must be joking.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.440
007 on an island populated
exclusively by women?

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.110
We won't see him till dawn.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.860
- I'll relieve you at midnight.
- No problem.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.010
Are we going somewhere?

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.050
I have to go to Europe
tomorrow on a business trip.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.520
Oh, that's a pity. I was just
beginning to enjoy myself.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.350
I think you should stay.
I'll only be gone a week.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.900
When I come back we'll discuss the future.

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:33.740
Well, I can't guarantee that
I'll be here when you return.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.320
Oh, James. We're two of a kind.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.870
There are vast rewards for a man of
your talents willing to take risks.

01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:47.790
- I'm not for hire.
- A man of principle.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.880
With a price on his head.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.090
Naturally, you would do
it for Queen and country.

01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:58.010
I have no country, I have
no price on my head.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.140
I don't have to apologise to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.030
No.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.240
You're right.

01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:25.830
We are two of a kind.

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.470
James.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.080
Q?

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.220
Is something wrong?

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:54.390
Not really.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.560
Just a feeling.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.860
Why don't you come back to bed?

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:22.300
Move!

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.070
James.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.830
Watch it!

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.590
Come on.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.860
Careful.

01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:35.410
The gun!

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.440
What happened to Vijay?

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.360
He was alive when I found him.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.740
- Did he say anything?
- Only "It was Kamal's men."

01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.620
No more problems.

01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:07.210
- Better signal M to meet me in Berlin.
- Why?

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.800
Well, I have to go to a
circus in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:23.810
We verified the Octopussy Circus was
in East Berlin when we lost 009.

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:27.730
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.

01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:33.360
Why would General Orlov
participate in a jewellery caper?

01:21:33.490 --> 01:21:37.410
Well, the jewellery, sir, I think
is, if you'll forgive the analogy,

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:40.620
only the tip of the tentacle.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.160
Here's the ID you'll need.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:47.420
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.880
visiting furniture
factories in East Germany.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.420
- Karl will take you in.
- No problem.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.180
Remember, 007, you're on your own.

01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:08.770
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.410
Mischka.

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:10.930
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:15.010
He just arrived from Leningrad.

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:17.220
The Romanov Star.

01:26:27.690 --> 01:26:29.700
The Romanov Star.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.980
Stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.400
You stay, also.

01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:32.900
100 kiloton yield.

01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:38.110
The effects are indistinguishable
from the American medium-yield bomb.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:45.410
The detonator, now listen carefully.
It is pre-set for a four-hour delay.

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.620
Set time for the explosion here.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:59.720
To activate, insert and twist the
lever a quarter-turn clockwise.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.810
Be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off, hm?

01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:09.290
The jewellery should net
us 300 million in Zich.

01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:12.460
We still have to cross the border.

01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.470
I must go.

01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:22.630
Au revoir, dear lady.

01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:25.140
Good luck.

01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:10.490
Bring the canister.

01:32:20.210 --> 01:32:22.250
Put it in the car.

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:31.640
Leave that. Let's go.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:35.680
Let's stay. Sit on that box. Hands
on your knees. Come on, move.

01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:39.020
Why is that bomb on the train?

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:43.860
- Who are you?
- British secret service.

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:51.950
You should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:56.910
I am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.

01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:01.380
You can't be inviting a nuclear war.
What happens when the US retaliates?

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.500
Against whom?

01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:08.340
My God. Of course.

01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:12.930
Our early-warning system will rule
out the bomb having come from Russia

01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:15.100
or anywhere else.

01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:20.100
Everyone will assume incorrectly that it
was a US bomb triggered accidentally.

01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:24.690
That would be the most
plausible explanation.

01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:27.440
Europe will insist on disarmament,

01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:31.240
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will.

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.700
It doesn't matter a damn to you

01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:37.450
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident.

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:40.790
Better than letting a handful
of old men in Moscow

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:45.040
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks.

01:33:45.210 --> 01:33:49.420
On your feet, General. You're
going to stop that train.

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.090
- Too late.
- You can stop it at the border.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.850
Kill him!

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.210
Kill him!

01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:43.680
Get to the station!

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.780
Stop that car!

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.270
Stop.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.610
Follow that car.

01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:21.090
Kamal Khan says we are to stay
here until we cross the border.

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:32.600
The license plate is General Orlov's.

01:37:33.690 --> 01:37:36.060
We have discovered this.

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:42.780
- Where is General Orlov now?
- Last reported heading for the border.

01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:13.700
I must get to that train.

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.630
Stop!

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:37.520
A common thief.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.690
A disgrace to the uniform.

01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:43.730
Yes. But tomorrow...

01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:47.150
I shall be a hero...

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.610
of the Soviet Union.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.020
It is now 11:45.

01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:25.480
The performance begins at 3.

01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:30.110
Allowing for delays, set the
bomb to detonate at 3.45.

01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:51.380
We must leave the base by 3.15.

01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:54.590
I take it none of you will be late.

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.100
The jewellery.

01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:13.570
- Did you recognise him?
- No.

01:43:13.690 --> 01:43:15.730
Stay here with her.

01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:05.030
On the roof. Trouble.

01:44:30.850 --> 01:44:32.230
Mischka.

01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:10.180
And this...

01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:13.100
for my brother.

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:21.020
And that's for 009.

01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:04.920
Gobinda will stay with the jewellery.

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.990
General, excuse me. I have some travel
arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.

01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:57.110
- Thank you.
- I'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this.

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.700
I know he won't be disappointed.

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.540
- That was Bond.
- Good. Let him keep going.

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.960
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too.

01:50:35.210 --> 01:50:37.210
Great, isn't it?

01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.300
Fantastic.

01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:52.770
- Marvellous.
- General...

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:55.860
How long would I get in the
brig if I stole your wallet?

01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:58.110
- About two years.
- That long?

01:50:58.230 --> 01:51:01.150
Well, in that case, I'd better return it.

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:03.030
Son of a gun.

01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:16.250
- Where's the Base Commander?
- Let's see your circus pass.

01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.420
Damn it, man, it's urgent.

01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:21.470
Get out. Hands up!

01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:35.770
Some nut in a red shirt went through in a stolen car.
Wants the Base Commander.

01:51:38.690 --> 01:51:40.570
There he is.

01:51:43.610 --> 01:51:45.700
Go after that guy in the red shirt.

01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:47.950
Behind the trailers.

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:12.060
Keep searching, you guys. He's
gotta be around here somewhere.

01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:18.150
Look under the trailer, you guys.

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:52.260
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Hey. Is anyone else in there?

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:59.560
For the first time in this country,
the death-defying human cannonball.

01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:06.030
I have the pleasure in presenting
to you Francisco the Fearless.

01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:15.080
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.

01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:24.750
That's him.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:31.090
Hold it, buddy. You're coming with us.

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:51.700
- General, there's a bomb in that cannon.
- Sure. Where else would a bomb be?

01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:55.990
- Great clown.
- I'm deadly serious. I'm a British agent.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:59.040
- What?
- For God's sake, tell him who I am.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:03.920
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you. I saw
them take the jewellery off the train.

01:54:05.170 --> 01:54:07.500
Does that convince you?

01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:11.970
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45.
That's 90 seconds from now.

01:54:12.090 --> 01:54:14.720
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.

01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:24.400
He'll destroy the entire operation.

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.830
You two, grab that man. Hold him.

01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.800
Damn it. Let go.

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:52.670
Let me go, there's a bomb in there.

01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:06.190
Let him go.

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:09.230
Quiet, everyone.

01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.130
Now?

01:55:28.170 --> 01:55:30.880
Thank you. Great job, sir.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.130
Where was Kamal going?

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.550
Back to India.

01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:44.730
Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.

01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:47.230
You and your families are safe.

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:53.070
Now, please leave the tent in
an orderly manner. Thank you.

01:55:56.610 --> 01:56:00.070
- The plane is refuelled.
- We'll take off at sunrise.

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:03.370
- Are the gold certificates on board?
- Yes, Excellence.

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.040
We'll take these also. Dollars,
pounds, francs, marks.

01:56:09.210 --> 01:56:11.540
I can always print my own.

01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:18.380
- What is that?
- Girls selling themselves.

01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:21.800
Good. It will keep the men occupied.

01:56:21.970 --> 01:56:24.020
I don't want them to see me leave.

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.730
Now.

01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.790
Give us a hand.

01:57:24.450 --> 01:57:26.490
Come on.

01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:52.310
Let's go. All set?

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.280
Lift.

01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.660
That's it. Steady.

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:25.090
- Make sure the horses are saddled.
- Yes, Excellence.

01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:27.800
I'll join you in a few minutes.

01:58:41.190 --> 01:58:46.070
- Do you really think you can escape me?
- Orlov betrayed us.

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.030
I swear I knew nothing about the bomb.

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:55.540
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy,
I would never do anything to hurt you.

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:12.310
You left me to be killed along
with thousands of innocent people.

01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:14.060
Octopussy.

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.140
Octopussy.

01:59:17.230 --> 01:59:22.360
Look. I was bringing you this.
We can make millions.

01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:30.120
Take her. She's our ticket out of here.

01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:56.390
- I trust you can handle this contraption.
- It goes by hot air.

01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.560
Oh, then you can.

02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:11.490
- They're doing fine.
- But I don't see Octopussy.

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:31.470
- There she is. She's in trouble.
- Get your hands off me.

02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:34.470
- I'll take her down.
- No. Up!

02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:39.810
Where are you going? Look, don't
be an idiot, 007. Come back.

02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:50.400
Kill him.

02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:16.780
Come on.

02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:25.160
What are you doing? Cut it out. We
haven't time for that. Later perhaps.

02:02:50.110 --> 02:02:52.150
Come on. Giddap.

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:09.080
Come on.

02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:40.170
He'll kill us all. Go out and get him.

02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:42.340
- Out there?
- Go.

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.430
Yes, Excellence.

02:06:05.050 --> 02:06:06.590
Jump!

02:06:31.410 --> 02:06:36.750
My government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred.

02:06:38.170 --> 02:06:42.540
However, we request Bond to return one
of our most historic treasures...

02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:44.380
the Romanov Star.

02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:49.260
In the interests of our Anglo-Soviet
relationships, that can be arranged.

02:06:50.090 --> 02:06:52.100
Where is Commander Bond?

02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:57.640
Owing to the serious nature of his injuries,
he's still not fit enough to travel.

02:06:57.850 --> 02:07:01.810
In. Out. In. Out.

02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:18.290
- I wish...
- What?

02:07:20.710 --> 02:07:24.040
I wish you weren't in such
a weakened condition.

02:07:25.630 --> 02:07:27.460
James!

02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:35.460
James!
