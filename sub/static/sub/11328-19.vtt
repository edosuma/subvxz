of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.700 --> 00:03.400
Did he call you?

00:03.500 --> 00:06.867
No, but we agreed we're not going
to call each other every day.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.167
You think I'm a good kisser?

00:08.201 --> 00:10.733
Of course anyone can become
a better kisser with practice.

00:10.767 --> 00:11.733
Is that true?

00:11.767 --> 00:12.967
I could practice with you.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.568
It's for
the mother-daughter dance.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.300
It's sort of a ritual I
like to do in the springtime.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.000
We always have
a father-daughter dance.

00:18.034 --> 00:21.267
Mother-daughter dances are always
interesting and usually fun.

00:21.301 --> 00:23.201
Did your dad remarry?
She's not my mother.

00:23.234 --> 00:25.101
Yeah, I don't do anything
with her.

00:25.134 --> 00:26.967
Grace, I didn't say
when we were getting married.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.800
I said we were thinking
about it.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.034
Well, I hope you do that.

00:30.067 --> 00:31.568
I hope you think about it,
and when you do,

00:31.600 --> 00:33.301
I hope you realize
that it's too soon.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.934
Ricky...
What?

00:34.967 --> 00:37.301
I know how you get
when people get close.

00:37.334 --> 00:39.067
And you'll have a chance
to go to counseling.

00:39.101 --> 00:41.067
Yeah, I don't really have anything
to talk about to a stranger.

00:41.101 --> 00:42.234
That's not going to happen.

00:42.267 --> 00:44.667
I want you to want me,
and I want to want you,

00:44.700 --> 00:46.401
but how are we going
to do that, George?

00:46.434 --> 00:48.600
You have my word that I'm going
to do the best that I can do.

00:48.633 --> 00:51.134
There has to be a reason why
that Jimmy hasn't called her.

00:51.167 --> 00:53.301
Do you really think Ricky's
going to dash over here

00:53.334 --> 00:54.667
and throw himself at Amy

00:54.700 --> 00:56.834
because she doesn't have
a boyfriend again? Yes.

00:56.867 --> 00:57.934
Just close your eyes.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.434
Well?

01:03.434 --> 01:05.200
I don't know if I need you
to go to a dance.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.900
I'd love it if you would go.
I love you, Mom.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.934
I love you, too, Ashley.

All right, I think John's
down for the night,

01:23.667 --> 01:26.134
but I'll just stick
around in case he's not.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.167
Yeah, why don't you?

01:27.201 --> 01:28.267
I didn't know
you were coming over,

01:28.301 --> 01:30.633
but since you're here,
feel free to stay.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.101
I told Amy I would be here

01:32.134 --> 01:33.501
when she gets home
from the dance.

01:33.534 --> 01:36.267
Besides, I like spending time
with John.

01:36.301 --> 01:38.568
He's my son.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.334
Is that some kind of remark
to us,

01:42.367 --> 01:44.767
the other fathers in the room, about
spending time with their children?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.101
You're not
spending time with your son.

01:46.134 --> 01:47.468
You're spending time
with his walkie-talkie.

01:47.501 --> 01:50.434
Okay, but I'm just
keeping my word to Amy,

01:50.468 --> 01:51.733
and it wasn't a remark.

01:51.767 --> 01:52.900
Yeah, well, my wife and son

01:52.934 --> 01:54.267
aren't always here
for me to spend time with,

01:54.301 --> 01:55.568
and that's not my choice,

01:55.600 --> 01:57.034
and he missed the first
16 years of Adrian's life,

01:57.067 --> 01:58.367
and that wasn't his choice.

01:58.401 --> 02:01.334
So I thought it was a remark.
Excuse me.

02:01.367 --> 02:03.867
Okay, George, I don't think
Ricky meant anything.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.900
You don't, huh?
Something going on?

02:05.934 --> 02:08.366
Like? Are you upset
with me for some reason?

02:08.401 --> 02:10.067
What makes you think that?
No reason.

02:10.101 --> 02:11.501
I'll just be somewhere else
in the house.

02:11.534 --> 02:12.600
All right, look, it's fine.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.334
Look, just sit down.
We'll deal you in.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.401
That's okay. I'll watch TV

02:15.434 --> 02:17.034
or read or something
in the other room.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.967
The prospect of playing poker with
the two of us doesn't appeal to you?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.733
No, but it doesn't bother me
if that's what you're asking.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.401
Hey, I'm just trying to...
Really, it doesn't bother you?

02:25.434 --> 02:27.134
Because if I was sitting
across the table

02:27.167 --> 02:28.867
from the father of the girl
I got pregnant

02:28.900 --> 02:30.733
and the father of the girl
I'm now sleeping with...

02:30.767 --> 02:32.267
George, do you mind?
Sorry.

02:32.301 --> 02:34.468
It would absolutely scare
the living...

02:34.501 --> 02:36.267
All right, all right.
If he doesn't want to play,

02:36.301 --> 02:37.568
he doesn't want to play,
right?

02:37.600 --> 02:38.667
Whatever. It's up to him.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.900
What are the stakes?

02:39.934 --> 02:42.034
Just playing to play.

02:42.067 --> 02:44.134
All right, why not?

02:44.167 --> 02:45.633
I pretty much
told you why not.

02:45.667 --> 02:46.867
You want another reason?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.667
Is there another reason?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.367
Is there?

02:51.633 --> 02:53.301
Never mind. Let's go.

02:56.101 --> 02:57.501
You kissed Amy?

02:57.534 --> 02:58.800
You kissed Amy?

03:00.267 --> 03:02.267
I guess he had
to have kissed Amy.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.834

I really just wanted you
to have a night out together

05:22.834 --> 05:23.934
Can we?

05:23.967 --> 05:25.101
We just got here.

05:25.134 --> 05:26.334

of mothers and daughters

05:28.101 --> 05:29.600
standing around
staring at each other.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.800
We can do that at home.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.834
Maybe step 1
is staring at each other,

05:32.867 --> 05:34.767
and step 2 is talking
with each other,

05:34.800 --> 05:38.568

with each other.

We're not going to dance
with each other.

Oh, what do you know?

05:45.034 --> 05:46.301
I know as much as you do.

05:46.334 --> 05:47.501
Yeah, well, I know plenty.

05:47.534 --> 05:48.767
Well, I don't know
what that means,

going on all week

What? No.

06:02.301 --> 06:03.568
I just thought...

06:03.600 --> 06:07.000
I know he hasn't called you.

06:07.034 --> 06:11.267
Hey, everybody. Hey, Amy, you want
to get out there and dance? Come on.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.800
Okay, my journalistic gut
tells me

06:14.834 --> 06:17.201
that this is some sort
of social experiment.

06:17.234 --> 06:19.434
Really, what kind
of social experiment?

06:19.468 --> 06:21.700
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure

06:21.733 --> 06:23.434
that it's going to affect
our grades.

06:23.468 --> 06:24.667
So has he called you yet?

06:24.700 --> 06:26.334
Who?
You know who.

06:26.367 --> 06:29.101
What do you think?
I'm sorry.

06:29.134 --> 06:32.167
But if he does, this time
I'll be ready for him.

06:32.201 --> 06:34.468
Where do you two think
you're going?

06:34.501 --> 06:36.767
You are not leaving me alone
to talk to my mother.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.600
You do realize
that you just left your mother

06:38.633 --> 06:40.534
alone with my mother
and all the other mothers.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.800
That's dangerous.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.934
It's dangerous for you.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.201
It's not dangerous for me.

06:44.234 --> 06:46.267
I'm not doing anything.

06:46.301 --> 06:47.434
Did Jimmy...

06:47.468 --> 06:50.967
No, but if he does call,
she's got condoms.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.101
What?

06:52.134 --> 06:53.468
You said you were prepared.

06:53.501 --> 06:55.067
I said I was ready.

06:55.101 --> 06:57.867
Big difference. And I didn't
mean ready to have sex,

06:57.900 --> 07:02.501
just ready for, you know,
Jimmy.

07:02.534 --> 07:04.367
And by the way, I do have
a condom in my purse.

07:04.401 --> 07:08.234
No offense, but if he didn't call
you because you're a bad kisser,

07:08.267 --> 07:11.334
he's not going to try to have
sex with you, do you think?

07:11.367 --> 07:13.633
No.
I'm not a bad kisser.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.267
No, of course not.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.067
Yeah, I'm sure
it's something else.

07:17.101 --> 07:18.834
You can think
whatever you want,

07:18.867 --> 07:20.201
but I'm not a bad kisser.

07:20.234 --> 07:21.568
I know I'm not.

07:27.134 --> 07:29.000
So why hasn't he called?
I don't know.

07:29.034 --> 07:31.334
You know.
Did she have sex with Jimmy?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.534

She's not going to have sex

George is really good

07:53.900 --> 07:56.501
Well, I mean, he was good
to talk to Grace

07:56.534 --> 07:58.401
when Grace needed someone
to talk to...

07:58.434 --> 08:01.134
not that Grace is
a child, but...

08:01.167 --> 08:02.534
I don't really know if George
is good with children.

08:02.568 --> 08:04.000
We didn't have children
ourselves,

I'm getting married
to Adrian's dad, to Ruben.

08:20.401 --> 08:21.633
Did Grace tell you?

08:21.667 --> 08:22.800
No, she didn't.

08:22.834 --> 08:23.867
Yeah, married
for the first time.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.301
Can you believe it?

08:25.334 --> 08:28.800
Well, I'm actually thinking
about it myself, marriage.

08:28.834 --> 08:31.201
You are?
Yes, I am.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.501
I mean, I know it's soon,

08:32.534 --> 08:33.900
but I want to be married.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.167
To anyone in particular?

08:35.201 --> 08:38.067
Of course.
Funny. In particular

08:38.101 --> 08:40.101
Yeah, yeah,
but you don't know him.

08:40.134 --> 08:41.167
I heard he's a doctor.

08:41.201 --> 08:43.201

Interesting.

08:44.468 --> 08:46.767
I mean, congratulations.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.101
[chuckles]
Yes, he's an OB/GYN.

08:49.134 --> 08:50.434
Nice.

08:50.468 --> 08:51.967
Yeah. I mean, that's not
why I'm marrying him.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.834
He's a brother of someone
I knew... know... knew.

08:56.733 --> 08:58.000
How's the baby?

08:58.034 --> 08:59.234

09:05.700 --> 09:07.334
and taking care of the babies.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.800
That's just Madison
being Madison.

09:10.834 --> 09:11.834
She'll come around.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.867
That Dead Parents Club?

09:13.900 --> 09:16.201
It's given her
a really great place to vent.

09:17.468 --> 09:19.067
She and Jack started a club

09:19.101 --> 09:22.401
for kids whose parents are,
you know, dead.

09:22.434 --> 09:23.733
They meet all the time.

09:23.767 --> 09:26.600
Uh, that... that's not true.
They can't be.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.000
They might be meeting,

09:28.034 --> 09:30.267
but it's probably not
about dead parents.

09:30.301 --> 09:33.101
It's probably about sex.

09:33.134 --> 09:35.334
Oh, I don't think there's
a real club called the...

09:35.367 --> 09:37.234
The Dead Parents Club, yeah.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.900
No, I don't think Madison
would be in anything like that.

09:39.934 --> 09:41.301
Madison is having sex?

09:41.334 --> 09:44.134
Uh... kind of.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.834
Uh-oh, I think I just got
the stink eye.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.468
I told you this would happen.

10:03.501 --> 10:06.167
I really want to know what
happened with Amy and that Jim guy.

10:06.201 --> 10:08.301
Who cares?
I do.

10:08.334 --> 10:10.367
Maybe you should encourage Ben
to go back with her.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.568
I'm not going to do that.
I like Ben.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.034
Besides, even if I encouraged
him, he wouldn't go back.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.834
He's really, really happy
to be out of that relationship.

10:18.867 --> 10:20.667
Did he tell you that just
before you had sex or something?

10:20.700 --> 10:24.800
We didn't have sex.
We're just friends...

10:24.834 --> 10:26.934
for right now anyway.

10:26.967 --> 10:29.000
Aren't you friends
with him, too?

10:29.034 --> 10:30.201
There are friends,

10:30.234 --> 10:32.934
and then there are "friends."

10:32.967 --> 10:34.733
Are you still friends
with Jack,

10:34.767 --> 10:36.834
the "friend" you had sex with?

10:36.867 --> 10:39.034
Are you still
friends with Jack?

10:39.067 --> 10:40.667
Didn't you have sex
with him, too?

10:40.700 --> 10:42.733
Right, I almost forgot.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.700
Okay, no, I'm not still
friends with Jack.

10:44.733 --> 10:45.934
I don't need friends
like that.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.367
I'm in love with Ricky.

10:47.401 --> 10:50.234
Great, because I think Ricky
is in love with you, too,

10:50.267 --> 10:53.568
so you should just forget about
Amy and who she's with or not with.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.767
Yeah, well, I think
he's in love with me,

10:56.800 --> 10:58.600
but I also think that
there's something going on

10:58.633 --> 11:01.967
between the two of them besides
just sharing the joy of parenthood.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.468
Look, I just don't think she's quite
as innocent as everyone thinks she is.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.468
Maybe she had sex with Jimmy,
and that was it,

11:08.501 --> 11:10.501
one time,
and it was over.

11:10.534 --> 11:12.867
Sometimes guys
just want to have sex

11:12.900 --> 11:15.034
to see if they can have sex.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.134
He had sex with her and
then never called her again.

11:17.167 --> 11:18.468
It happens all the time.

11:18.501 --> 11:21.134
You are so negative
and dramatic.

11:21.167 --> 11:22.867
I doubt that they had sex.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.101
Why? Why do you doubt it?

11:26.134 --> 11:30.468
Because I heard he thought
Amy was a bad kisser,

11:30.501 --> 11:32.301
so I don't think
that they had sex.

11:32.334 --> 11:33.367
A bad kisser?

11:33.401 --> 11:37.501
That's what I heard
from my friend Jack,

11:37.534 --> 11:40.534
who heard it from his
"more than a friend" Madison.

11:40.568 --> 11:42.767
That Amy's a bad kisser?

11:42.800 --> 11:43.800
Mm-hmm.

11:45.534 --> 11:48.301
I don't know. That sounds like
some crazy Madison rumor.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.367
What kind of kisser is Ben?

11:50.401 --> 11:53.201
I didn't say that I kissed Ben.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.234
Okay, I kissed Ben,
and I like the way he kisses.

11:56.267 --> 11:57.633
He kind of lets me kiss him,

11:57.667 --> 12:00.700
like he takes the cues
from me.

12:00.733 --> 12:02.967
I like being the more aggressive
one in the relationship.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.633
Yeah, I remember
the stories you told me

12:04.667 --> 12:06.568
about your first time
with Jack.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.134
Okay, but if Ben's
a good kisser, then...

12:09.167 --> 12:12.867
You must like him.
Do you?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.733
Oh, hi, Alice.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.367
I just don't want to see him
get his heart broken.

12:16.401 --> 12:18.800
Well, she doesn't want to get
her heart broken, either.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.534
He was smitten with you
the first day of school.

12:20.568 --> 12:22.167
I told him Amy was
more attainable.

12:22.201 --> 12:25.134
Turns out she wasn't, but
I'm still not sure about you.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.633
I don't think I would've been
attainable back then.

12:27.667 --> 12:29.468
I mean, I just started dating,

12:29.501 --> 12:31.534
and I really,
really like Jack...

12:31.568 --> 12:32.600
I loved him even...

12:32.633 --> 12:34.867
but now things are different.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.633
Ben Boykewich is an...
interesting guy,

12:37.667 --> 12:39.568
very interesting,

12:39.600 --> 12:40.867
and I really think

12:40.900 --> 12:43.733
there could be a possibility
of a future there.

12:43.767 --> 12:44.934
We have a lot in common.

12:44.967 --> 12:46.000
I'll give you that.

12:46.034 --> 12:48.201
He is interesting... Ben.

12:48.234 --> 12:51.301
A lot more interesting than I
ever would have thought.

12:51.334 --> 12:53.633
Hey, did those two have sex,
Ben and Amy?

12:53.667 --> 12:54.767
No, they didn't have sex.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.633
Are you sure?
Yes.

12:56.667 --> 12:57.667
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.934
I think she's having sex.

12:58.967 --> 13:00.767
The question is
who is she having sex with?

13:00.800 --> 13:04.367
There's only one way to tell,
isn't there?

13:05.667 --> 13:07.434
And let me tell you something.

13:07.468 --> 13:08.934
If Amy's
having sex with Ricky,

13:08.967 --> 13:10.067
I'm having sex with Ben.

13:10.101 --> 13:12.167
But I like Ben.
I just told you I liked Ben.

13:12.201 --> 13:14.434
I don't care. Go back
to only one way to tell.

13:20.101 --> 13:21.967
May I join you?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.900
I'm Alice's mother.
Um, I'm Fern.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.034
I'm Kathleen.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.401
Cindy.
Ann.

13:28.434 --> 13:31.700
So...

13:31.733 --> 13:34.633
who's going
to Leo and Betty's wedding?

13:34.667 --> 13:36.733
Leo and Betty?

13:36.767 --> 13:38.501
Uh, I hadn't heard.

13:38.534 --> 13:41.201
We haven't been invited,
but we really don't know them.

13:41.234 --> 13:43.234
I have a wedding of my own
coming up.

13:43.267 --> 13:45.267
I'm getting married, too,
to Adrian's dad.

13:45.301 --> 13:46.334
We were
high school sweethearts.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.633
Kathleen's getting married.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.700
Mazel tov.

13:48.733 --> 13:50.600
Yes, thank you.
He's Jewish.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.201
My husband passed away.

13:53.234 --> 13:55.334
Not even a year ago.
Ann just had a baby.

13:55.367 --> 13:59.234
Oh, I thought it was your
daughter who had the baby.

13:59.267 --> 14:00.267
It was both of us.

14:00.301 --> 14:01.667
Ah.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.401
Good for you.

14:03.434 --> 14:06.534
How's he or she doing?

14:06.568 --> 14:08.301
[together]
He's fine.

14:08.334 --> 14:10.134
In case you're all wondering,

14:10.167 --> 14:11.834
I'm getting married, too,

14:11.867 --> 14:14.201
to my ex-husband,
the father.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.468
Good for her,

14:22.500 --> 14:26.900
even if most second marriages to
the same person never workout.

14:39.901 --> 14:41.867
I wasn't hiding. I couldn't
get him back to sleep.

14:41.901 --> 14:43.967
Let's just play cards, huh?

14:46.567 --> 14:48.967
Did Amy tell you what happened,
or were you spying on us?

14:50.634 --> 14:52.934
Oh, of course. Ashley.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.467
But what Ashley doesn't know

14:54.500 --> 14:55.734
is that Amy asked me
to kiss her.

14:55.767 --> 14:56.967
It wasn't like
we were really kissing.

14:57.001 --> 14:58.300
What was it like?
I don't know.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.767
It was just her
wanting to practice.

14:59.801 --> 15:02.400
Oh, geez, not that she wanted an excuse.

15:02.434 --> 15:04.901
She did, and I figured it
would give her more confidence

15:04.934 --> 15:06.500
if she had more practice.

15:06.534 --> 15:08.267
Someone told her
she was a bad kisser.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.967
Of course.
You were just helping her out.

15:10.001 --> 15:11.434
No, you weren't.

15:11.467 --> 15:13.267
You figured you'd take advantage
of her, and you know it.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.600
Amy's not that naive.

15:14.634 --> 15:16.267
She's not that easily
taken advantage of.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.834
She knew what she was doing.

15:17.867 --> 15:21.333
I was just kissing her because
she wanted to be kissed.

15:21.367 --> 15:23.801
She wanted to practice.
It was a favor

15:23.834 --> 15:26.934
and not a favor that I wanted
everyone to know about.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.600
What was I going to do,
tell her no

15:28.634 --> 15:31.400
and make her feel that
oh, sure, we had a baby

15:31.434 --> 15:32.634
but I don't even find her

15:32.667 --> 15:34.801
attractive enough
to kiss her when she asks?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.367
Geez, no good deed.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.367
So she asked you to kiss her
to practice with you?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.934
Who the hell told her
she was a bad kisser?

15:39.967 --> 15:41.767
Not me. It wasn't me.
It was her girlfriends.

15:41.801 --> 15:43.434
They planted that seed
in her head.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.534
They told her
that if Jimmy hadn't called,

15:45.567 --> 15:48.034
then maybe it was because
she was a bad kisser.

15:48.068 --> 15:50.500
Then she came to me
for help.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.867
I was just helping her.

15:51.901 --> 15:53.534
[baby crying]

15:58.801 --> 16:00.634
That wasn't Robbie.
That was John.

16:00.667 --> 16:01.901
Should I go in there?

16:01.934 --> 16:03.734
Nope, I wouldn't.

16:03.767 --> 16:05.300
I can't believe
Ashley told him.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.034
It was just a kiss.
We weren't having sex.

16:07.068 --> 16:08.600
It was like kissing my sister.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.634
Is that what you're going
to tell Adrian?

16:10.667 --> 16:13.068
Huh? That it was just
like kissing your sister?

16:13.101 --> 16:15.267
I don't know
what I'm going to tell her,

16:15.300 --> 16:16.734
but don't tell her.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.934
Please, don't tell her.

16:17.967 --> 16:20.168
I'll tell her, promise.
Just let me tell her.

16:20.233 --> 16:21.701
It's not that big a deal.

16:21.734 --> 16:23.534
Uh, yeah, it is a big deal,

16:23.567 --> 16:25.068
and I know what this is about.

16:25.101 --> 16:26.534
This is about Adrian meeting
your parents, isn't it?

16:26.567 --> 16:28.001
What? No.

16:28.034 --> 16:29.600
[baby coos]

16:29.634 --> 16:32.333
This is what happens
when you have sex with a girl

16:32.367 --> 16:34.233
that doesn't know
anything about sex,

16:34.267 --> 16:36.400
wasn't planning on having sex.

16:36.434 --> 16:38.701
Come on, John.

16:38.734 --> 16:41.400
What's the matter?
Were we too loud in here?

16:41.434 --> 16:44.168
Let's go.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.600
I hope Adrian knows
what she's doing.

16:45.634 --> 16:47.200
Oh, I think she knows
what she's doing.

16:47.233 --> 16:48.834
She just doesn't know
what he's doing.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.901
You going to tell her?
No, I'm not going to tell her.

16:50.934 --> 16:52.233
I'll let Ricky tell her.

16:52.267 --> 16:53.500
I'm staying out of this.

16:53.534 --> 16:54.967
He told me there's
no heat between them,

16:55.001 --> 16:56.001
him and Amy,

16:56.034 --> 16:57.068
and he ends up kissing her.

16:57.101 --> 16:58.767
So maybe she did ask him
to kiss her.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.233
Maybe what he's saying is true.

17:00.267 --> 17:01.233
Whose side are you on?

17:01.267 --> 17:04.001
Truthfully, Adrian's.

17:08.034 --> 17:10.300
[buzzes]

17:13.167 --> 17:14.134
Hey, Madison.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.267
Hey, Jack.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.300
<i>I was just thinking
about you.</i>

17:17.333 --> 17:18.701
Really?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.901
Me or us doing what we do?

17:22.200 --> 17:23.967
Madison, you know what?

17:24.001 --> 17:26.068
I was thinking
that I've been totally wrong

17:26.101 --> 17:27.834
in the way
I've been treating you,

17:27.867 --> 17:31.233
like I'm only going out
with you for that reason

17:31.267 --> 17:33.001
or like I'm only going out
with you

17:33.034 --> 17:34.233
because Grace and I broke up.

17:34.267 --> 17:37.233
Okay, I'm at a dance right now.

17:37.267 --> 17:41.734
I didn't really want to have
a long discussion, but what?

17:41.767 --> 17:43.168
I like you.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.400
You're fun, you're smart,
and you're really special,

17:46.434 --> 17:48.434
and if I ever made you feel

17:48.467 --> 17:51.101
like anything less than that,
I'm sorry.

17:51.134 --> 17:53.534
I just think we should
take things a little slower

17:53.567 --> 17:56.101
and maybe get to know each
other a little bit better.

17:56.134 --> 17:57.300
Are you drinking again?

17:57.333 --> 18:01.534
No, Madison, I'm not.
I... I really like you,

18:01.567 --> 18:04.567
and I may have been
having sex with you

18:04.600 --> 18:06.367
just to have sex
with you at first,

18:06.400 --> 18:09.701
but I think it could be
more than that.

18:09.734 --> 18:11.034
I want it to be more than that.

18:11.068 --> 18:13.101
But...
But?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.467
Are you breaking up with me?

18:14.500 --> 18:15.834
No, I'm not.

18:17.034 --> 18:19.434
Can I ask you a question?

18:19.467 --> 18:21.300
If you like me so much,

18:21.333 --> 18:23.534
do you have to be
such good friends with Grace?

18:23.567 --> 18:24.767
I...

18:24.801 --> 18:27.267
Yeah. I'll talk
to you later, Jack.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.434
<i>No. Wait, wait, wait.</i>

18:28.467 --> 18:29.801
Not if you don't want me to be

18:29.834 --> 18:31.600
or if that's going to get
in the way

18:31.634 --> 18:33.233
of our being boyfriend
and girlfriend.

18:33.267 --> 18:34.934
Okay.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.168
Okay?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.967
Okay. Just don't be friends
with Grace.

18:39.001 --> 18:41.534
[giggles]
Bye.

18:45.634 --> 18:46.934
What just happened?

18:51.367 --> 18:53.001
I just don't understand.

18:53.034 --> 18:54.134
It's easy.

18:54.168 --> 18:55.634
There's too much counting.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.834
Besides, I just came over
to talk about Grace.

18:57.867 --> 18:58.901
How's that going?
Good, huh?

18:58.934 --> 19:00.200
Yeah, it's going fine.

19:00.233 --> 19:01.701
Look, with cribbage,
once you get the hang of it,

19:01.734 --> 19:03.300
it comes second nature.
You just...

19:03.333 --> 19:04.701
I don't want to get
the hang of it.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.168
I just want to hear
about Grace.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.500
Then I want Alice to call me.

19:07.534 --> 19:08.834
Then I want to go over
to her house

19:08.867 --> 19:10.267
and get the hang of that.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.567
[chuckles]

19:11.600 --> 19:14.200
Sorry.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.267
So if you were going to call
someone right now,

19:16.300 --> 19:18.500
would it be Grace
or Maria or Amy?

19:18.534 --> 19:20.400
I could call any one of them.

19:20.434 --> 19:22.701
I am friends with Grace
and Maria and Amy.

19:22.734 --> 19:24.734
Uh-huh. It's Grace Bowman.

19:25.734 --> 19:27.333
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.068
Hey, guys, what's going on?

19:29.101 --> 19:30.934
I was just saying I can't
wait till you get back.

19:30.967 --> 19:32.767
Let's go.
Where are we going?

19:32.801 --> 19:34.134
Your house.
For?

19:34.168 --> 19:37.034
For whatever you want.
Why are you home so early?

19:37.068 --> 19:38.467
Did something go wrong
at the dance?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.467
Yeah, my mom has
no social skills.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.267
She tries, but... But?

19:42.300 --> 19:44.701
Did you know Amy's parents
were getting married again?

19:44.734 --> 19:46.934
No. I haven't talked to Amy.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.734
Wonder if she'll invite me
to the wedding.

19:48.767 --> 19:51.333
Did you say that because you hope
she will invite you to the wedding?

19:51.367 --> 19:53.300
Because I heard from Grace
that she really likes you.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.801
Grace or Amy?

19:56.101 --> 19:57.333
Time's up.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.967
You don't really care
about Grace.

19:59.001 --> 20:00.034
You're still in love with Amy.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.367
I'm not still in love with Amy.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.200
I care about her
because she's Amy.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.068
Did you and Amy have sex?

20:06.101 --> 20:07.667
Adrian thinks
you and Amy had sex.

20:07.701 --> 20:08.801
What?

20:08.834 --> 20:10.567
You told Adrian but not me? Us.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.934
I didn't have sex with Amy.

20:11.967 --> 20:14.434
I don't think
I could have sex with Amy

20:14.467 --> 20:15.767
even if she wanted
to have sex

20:15.801 --> 20:17.600
because it just
wouldn't be right.

20:20.634 --> 20:23.734
I finally realized that
it wouldn't be right.

20:23.767 --> 20:26.734
We're really not married,
and she already has one baby,

20:26.767 --> 20:30.801
and what would happen if, despite the
fact that we were very, very careful,

20:30.834 --> 20:32.134
she got pregnant again?

20:35.267 --> 20:36.734
First time we're hearing this.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.600
You broke up with her
because you were afraid

20:38.634 --> 20:40.434
if you ever did have sex with
her, she might get pregnant?

20:40.467 --> 20:43.500
I don't know.
It's so complicated.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.701
That was part of it, I think.

20:45.734 --> 20:47.967
I mean, I wanted
to have sex with her,

20:48.001 --> 20:52.200
and then I got kind of slightly
afraid of having sex with her.

20:52.233 --> 20:54.834
And then, once I had doubts
about having sex with her,

20:54.867 --> 20:57.101
I started having doubts
about the way I feel about her,

20:57.134 --> 21:00.367
and that led to doubts that we
should be in a relationship at all.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.300
Are you afraid if you have sex
with Grace, she might get pregnant?

21:03.333 --> 21:05.534
Well, no.

21:05.567 --> 21:08.233
You see, Hank, Grace has been
successful with birth control

21:08.267 --> 21:09.934
whereas Amy has not.

21:09.967 --> 21:11.500
[sighs]
I guess.

21:11.534 --> 21:13.801
Yeah, I guess that's it.

21:13.834 --> 21:16.600
I know it's not logical,
but...yeah.

21:16.634 --> 21:18.534
Well, about a quarter
of teenage mothers

21:18.567 --> 21:20.300
do have a second child
within two years

21:20.333 --> 21:21.967
of the birth
of their first child.

21:22.001 --> 21:23.667
By the same guy,
not by the same guy?

21:23.701 --> 21:25.300
You are an idiot.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.734
Amy Juergens would never
ever get pregnant again,

21:27.767 --> 21:29.834
not by you or Ricky
or any other guy.

21:31.467 --> 21:34.200
Eureka.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.967
Hey, we're going to bed.
Alice and Henry leave?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.334
I need to talk to you
about something.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.267
Sure, sure, what's going on?

21:52.834 --> 21:53.868
You look upset.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.601
It's not that I'm upset,
but...

22:00.967 --> 22:02.434
I think I had
kind of a breakthrough

22:02.467 --> 22:05.100
when I was talking to Alice
and Henry before, about Amy.

22:05.134 --> 22:06.967
Oh, yeah?
What kind of breakthrough?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.967
I realized that I'm afraid

22:09.000 --> 22:11.033
that if Amy and I ever did
have sex

22:11.067 --> 22:12.401
that she might get pregnant.

22:12.434 --> 22:13.634
Well, that's certainly
a possibility

22:13.667 --> 22:15.167
with any girl
you might have sex with.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.734
Yeah, but I was afraid
because Amy got pregnant before

22:17.768 --> 22:19.300
that she'd get pregnant again.

22:19.334 --> 22:23.000
A lot of girls do that. A lot
of teenage mothers do that.

22:23.033 --> 22:25.401
I heard that.
What are you getting at?

22:25.434 --> 22:30.234
I'm getting at...
that's not rational.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.501
A lot of fears
aren't rational.

22:32.534 --> 22:35.200
Yeah, I know, but, you know,
now that I've said it out loud,

22:35.234 --> 22:38.933
it sounds so stupid
and ridiculous.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.000
I'm going to go over
to Amy's and tell her,

22:41.033 --> 22:42.734
and I'm sure that
once we've talked about it,

22:42.768 --> 22:43.801
that we can talk through it,

22:43.834 --> 22:45.701
that we can get
to where we were before,

22:45.734 --> 22:47.501
not even
to where we were before

22:47.534 --> 22:49.100
but a place
that's better than that.

22:49.134 --> 22:50.100
I like Grace,

22:50.134 --> 22:52.868
and it was great kissing Grace,

22:52.900 --> 22:56.267
but it's not like kissing Amy,

22:56.300 --> 22:57.834
and I had fun with Maria,

22:57.868 --> 23:02.667
but, Dad, I love Amy.

23:02.701 --> 23:04.834
I don't like
being apart from Amy.

23:04.868 --> 23:06.834
I don't want to be apart
from her another day.

23:06.868 --> 23:10.334
Ben, why don't you
just sleep on it, okay?

23:10.367 --> 23:12.634
Even if you thought
your feelings were confused

23:12.667 --> 23:15.900
by this notion that Amy might
somehow get pregnant again

23:15.933 --> 23:17.501
and this time with you...

23:17.534 --> 23:20.300
God forbid, before you get
out of high school...

23:20.334 --> 23:23.667
that doesn't mean she's going
to understand it or like it.

23:23.701 --> 23:26.234
It might not sound as good
the second time you say it

23:26.267 --> 23:27.601
if you say it to Amy.

23:27.634 --> 23:29.501
You know what
I'm talking about?

23:29.534 --> 23:32.000
Do you really want
to tell Amy

23:32.033 --> 23:33.900
that you're afraid
she'll get pregnant?

23:33.933 --> 23:36.401
I know, but...
it's just so stupid.

23:36.434 --> 23:38.834
Yeah, listen to me, son.

23:38.868 --> 23:40.634
It might be stupider
to tell her.

23:40.667 --> 23:43.100
Sleep on it.

23:43.134 --> 23:45.933
Oh, geez, I can see you're
not going to take my advice,

23:45.967 --> 23:47.734
so let me give you
some more advice.

23:47.768 --> 23:50.401
Don't just sleep on it.
Don't do it,

23:50.434 --> 23:51.768
even if you sleep on it.

23:51.801 --> 23:53.900
Just take your time.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.768
Feelings are complex.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.701
This is
a complicated relationship.

23:57.734 --> 23:59.434
It's always been complicated.

23:59.467 --> 24:01.734
Take the time to make sure
of your feelings.

24:01.768 --> 24:04.367
Amy's not going to trust you
if you keep going back and forth

24:04.401 --> 24:06.601
like you have been
for the past six months.

24:06.634 --> 24:10.567
Like I told you before,
take it slow

24:10.601 --> 24:13.300
and don't tell her anything like
you're thinking about telling her.

24:16.033 --> 24:18.868
Ben, please, just listen to me.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.067
You're not thinking this
through.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.234
That wasn't the only reason
you broke up with Amy,

24:23.267 --> 24:25.534
this irrational fear,
was it?

24:25.567 --> 24:27.768
No, but I think that was
kind of underneath it all.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.300
I really do.

24:29.334 --> 24:34.801
Well, think about it some more.
Please do yourself a favor.

24:34.834 --> 24:37.100
Think about it some more.

24:44.401 --> 24:46.601
But you don't think
Lauren would have sex

24:46.634 --> 24:50.601
just because Madison is doing
what she's doing, do you?

24:50.634 --> 24:54.000
Girls in high school have sex
for all kinds of reasons

24:54.033 --> 24:56.234
and for no reason at all.

24:56.267 --> 24:57.868
I just think it's difficult

24:57.933 --> 25:00.567
for Lauren to make the right
choices for herself

25:00.601 --> 25:02.100
when she's surrounded

25:02.134 --> 25:03.933
by girls making
the wrong choices.

25:03.967 --> 25:05.834
No offense.

25:05.868 --> 25:09.734
Did you have sex
in high school?

25:09.768 --> 25:12.734
Me? Did you?

25:12.768 --> 25:13.900
Yes.

25:13.933 --> 25:16.067
I was a senior. You?

25:16.100 --> 25:18.267
No, I waited...

25:18.300 --> 25:20.067
for the wrong guy,

25:20.100 --> 25:21.367
my first husband.

25:21.401 --> 25:24.868
Yeah, my first guy was
the wrong guy, too.

25:31.367 --> 25:32.967
I couldn't help
but overhear that, too,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.167
but I didn't know
if I should interrupt.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.367
Yeah, what fun would that be?

25:39.401 --> 25:42.601
So how are you?
Better for hearing that.

25:42.634 --> 25:44.834
I don't know why,
but it helps to know

25:44.868 --> 25:46.401
that other women chose
the wrong first guy.

25:46.434 --> 25:47.933
The wrong guy
or the wrong time?

25:47.967 --> 25:50.000
That's
an interesting question.

25:51.634 --> 25:54.234
So your mom told my mom that she
and George are getting married again.

25:56.367 --> 25:59.834
Oh... yeah.
Yeah.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.701
Well, it was nice
talking to you.

26:03.734 --> 26:05.200
Think I should get
back in there.

26:11.967 --> 26:14.634
Ashley, where have you been?
Mom wants to leave.

26:14.667 --> 26:17.334
I just heard from the daughter
of wife number 1

26:17.367 --> 26:19.567
that Mom said she and Dad
are getting married again.

26:19.601 --> 26:20.768
What?
Yeah.

26:20.801 --> 26:22.033
Why didn't she tell us that?

26:22.067 --> 26:23.701
Well, I don't know
why she didn't tell us that.

26:23.734 --> 26:25.200
Why didn't she tell you,
though?

26:25.234 --> 26:26.900
I don't know.
Hi.

26:26.933 --> 26:32.334
Oh, Ashley, I need to talk to
Amy alone if you don't mind?

26:32.367 --> 26:34.033
Sorry, Adrian, I do mind.

26:34.067 --> 26:36.067
We're actually kind of in a
hurry to get out of here, so...

26:36.100 --> 26:38.267
You can talk to me in
front of Ashley. What's up?

26:38.300 --> 26:39.367
Oh, nothing,

26:39.401 --> 26:40.734
but I'm here with my mom,

26:40.768 --> 26:42.567
and Ricky's supposed to
stop by when we get home,

26:42.601 --> 26:44.501
you know,
after you get home,

26:44.534 --> 26:47.567
and I was wondering...

26:47.601 --> 26:48.801
Do you happen to have
a condom?

26:50.834 --> 26:53.067
As a matter of fact,
I do.

26:55.701 --> 26:56.868
Thank you.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.467
Mm-hmm.
Come on, let's go.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.100
[phone rings]

27:19.901 --> 27:21.334
Hello.
Hi, Mr. Juergens.

27:21.367 --> 27:24.434
It's Ben. Hey, ex-boyfriend,
we miss you around here.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.133
I miss you, too, all of you.

27:28.167 --> 27:32.067
Hey, I got my license, and I
was going to pick up a pizza,

27:32.100 --> 27:34.334
and I just thought
maybe I'd swing by.

27:34.367 --> 27:37.067
Maybe Amy and Ashley and Mrs.
Juergens will be home by then?

27:37.100 --> 27:38.267
Yeah, yeah, you're welcome
to come by, Ben.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.367
We'd love to see you.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.834
Oh, and I hear
congratulations are in order.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.701
Oh, yeah?
I heard you and Mrs. Juergens

27:43.734 --> 27:45.467
are becoming
Mr. and Mrs. again.

27:45.501 --> 27:47.434
Say again?
You're getting married.

27:47.467 --> 27:48.968
I am?
That's what I heard.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.534
That's the news
from the dance.

27:52.567 --> 27:53.801
I know it sounds childish,

27:53.834 --> 27:56.834
but I said it because
I'm a little overwhelmed

27:56.868 --> 27:58.501
by all the responsibility
right now.

27:58.534 --> 28:00.534
I said it because...

28:00.567 --> 28:04.667
I don't know. I just thought
that they were judging me.

28:04.701 --> 28:07.367
I feel like everyone here is
just looking at me and judging me.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.534
Yeah, welcome to my world.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.200
You created your world.

28:11.234 --> 28:13.267
Would you just tell me what's
going on between you two?

28:13.300 --> 28:15.133
Can we just go, please?

28:17.367 --> 28:19.934
We're leaving, so I just wanted
to say thanks for the condom.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.601
Good night.

28:24.801 --> 28:26.200
Was that a condom?

28:26.234 --> 28:28.200
I think we should go now.

28:28.234 --> 28:29.634
We can go now.

28:31.734 --> 28:33.067
What's with the condom?

28:35.801 --> 28:36.901
Why do you have a condom?

28:36.934 --> 28:38.234
I made her take it.

28:38.267 --> 28:39.901
She didn't make me take it.

28:39.934 --> 28:42.033
I asked for it because I don't
want to get pregnant again.

28:42.067 --> 28:43.934
So, Amy, you are having sex?

28:45.334 --> 28:46.501
With?

28:47.767 --> 28:50.067
Oh, God, is that
why you kissed Ricky?

28:50.100 --> 28:51.267
You're going to have sex
with him?

28:51.300 --> 28:53.367
What?

28:53.400 --> 28:55.868
It was only one condom, and
she obviously hasn't used it.

28:59.667 --> 29:03.334
Whoa.
[chuckles]

29:03.367 --> 29:06.000
It has been
a wonderful evening,

29:06.033 --> 29:07.934
but it's time
to say good night.

29:07.968 --> 29:10.267
[girls murmuring]
Good night.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.968
Not so fast.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.300
I have a few things
I need to say before we go.

29:14.334 --> 29:16.167
[girls moaning]

29:16.200 --> 29:18.634
My grandmother and her sister

29:18.667 --> 29:20.801
spent three years
in a concentration camp

29:20.834 --> 29:22.968
when they should've been
in high school,

29:23.000 --> 29:24.467
and they survived.

29:27.534 --> 29:30.100
They survived, they said,

29:30.133 --> 29:31.767
because every night,

29:31.801 --> 29:34.100
rather than sink down
into the horrors

29:34.133 --> 29:36.434
of what was going on
around them,

29:36.467 --> 29:39.334
they imagined that they
were once again dancing

29:39.367 --> 29:41.033
in their living room

29:41.067 --> 29:43.868
while their father
played the violin,

29:43.901 --> 29:47.100
and they found the courage
and the will to live

29:47.133 --> 29:49.200
driven by the memories

29:49.234 --> 29:51.834
of dancing with their mother

29:51.868 --> 29:53.467
and wanting so much

29:53.501 --> 29:55.133
to have just one more dance.

29:58.534 --> 29:59.801
When they told me that story,

29:59.834 --> 30:02.701
I thought, Wouldn't it be great

30:02.734 --> 30:04.467
if I could
get a bunch of girls

30:04.501 --> 30:06.868
together with their moms
and dance,

30:06.901 --> 30:09.167
create some kind
of special memory

30:09.200 --> 30:11.434
that might just get us all
through high school?

30:11.467 --> 30:13.133
I mean, that's possible,
isn't it?

30:15.434 --> 30:17.300
To take each other by the hand,

30:17.334 --> 30:18.534
mothers and daughters

30:18.567 --> 30:20.234
and dance away the pain
of what goes on

30:20.267 --> 30:22.667
every day in our hallways?

30:22.701 --> 30:24.667
Granted, it's not
a concentration camp

30:24.701 --> 30:26.901
and there's no war
going on here,

30:26.934 --> 30:30.901
but there are wars,
and then there are wars.

30:32.567 --> 30:35.434
If you've ever been made fun of

30:35.467 --> 30:38.300
or if you've ever made fun
of another girl,

30:38.334 --> 30:40.267
join me on the dance floor,
won't you?

30:40.300 --> 30:43.801
If you've ever wanted
what another girl has

30:43.834 --> 30:46.334
and resented her
for having it, join me.

30:47.701 --> 30:49.934
If you want to do what
the other girls are doing

30:49.968 --> 30:54.100
because you don't want
to feel insecure or left out

30:54.133 --> 30:58.601
or stupid or ugly or inferior,
join me.

30:58.634 --> 31:00.501
If you've ever wanted a guy

31:00.534 --> 31:02.767
just because he was going out
with some other girl

31:02.801 --> 31:06.067
and you wanted to hurt
that girl, join me.

31:06.100 --> 31:08.601
If you've ever wanted a guy

31:08.634 --> 31:09.934
not because you're
interested in him

31:09.968 --> 31:12.434
but because you want
to beat out the other girls

31:12.467 --> 31:15.501
in some sort of bizarre race
for the guys, join me.

31:16.934 --> 31:19.934
Join me, mothers and daughters.

31:19.968 --> 31:22.868
Join me in stopping
the meanness and competition

31:22.901 --> 31:25.100
that goes on every day
in our hallways.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.534
Not only do women have
the power to unite

31:29.567 --> 31:31.901
and stop all the wars going on
in the world...

31:31.934 --> 31:34.067
and I believe
we have that power...

31:34.100 --> 31:37.501
but we have the power to stop
the wars within,

31:37.534 --> 31:39.300
and there can be no peace

31:39.334 --> 31:40.868
until there is peace within.

31:44.834 --> 31:47.200
This is from my grandma Sadie

31:47.234 --> 31:48.567
and my great-aunt Pearl.

31:51.467 --> 31:55.334
<i>* ["Hava Nagila"]</i>

32:05.100 --> 32:07.200
Adrian, don't do it.

32:23.667 --> 32:25.300
[together]
Whoo!

32:27.300 --> 32:29.067
Whoo!

32:38.867 --> 32:40.267
[knock on door]

32:40.301 --> 32:42.667
Coming. Coming.

32:46.201 --> 32:47.900
Ben, what are you doing here?

32:47.934 --> 32:49.934
I told you dad I'd bring
some pizza over.

32:49.967 --> 32:51.600
Because...

32:51.633 --> 32:53.401
Because
I just wanted to see you

32:53.434 --> 32:55.001
as well as everyone else.

32:55.034 --> 32:57.934
Because...

32:57.967 --> 33:02.867
Um... if you heard that I kissed
Ricky, it was just a kiss, all right?

33:02.900 --> 33:04.934
Good night.

33:07.700 --> 33:09.700
Good night, Ben.

33:15.468 --> 33:16.667
What did you go
and do that for?

33:16.700 --> 33:18.301
What did I go and do what for?

33:18.334 --> 33:21.201
Well, Ben's a nice guy, Amy.
He's good for you.

33:21.234 --> 33:22.633
Yeah,
I know he's a nice guy,

33:22.667 --> 33:24.101
but I don't care
if he's good for me.

33:24.134 --> 33:27.567
Well, Jimmy's a nice guy, too,
and he'll call you, Amy.

33:29.167 --> 33:30.234
I know you kissed Ricky.

33:30.267 --> 33:31.567
I know why you kissed Ricky.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.201
Why?

33:33.234 --> 33:34.900
Because you were just
feeling a little insecure,

33:34.934 --> 33:37.700
and guys were saying you were a
bad kisser, but I'm sure you're not.

33:37.734 --> 33:40.867
Guys were not saying that.
Girls were saying that.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.334
Girls were assuming that

33:42.368 --> 33:43.800
because Jimmy
hasn't called me.

33:43.834 --> 33:45.167
I don't know why
Jimmy hasn't called me,

33:45.201 --> 33:46.700
but it's not because
I'm a bad kisser.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.301
Why did you ask Ricky
to practice kissing

33:48.334 --> 33:50.468
if you didn't want to become
a better kisser?

33:50.500 --> 33:53.934
Okay, well, when he
first offered to help me,

33:53.967 --> 33:55.700
I was kind of having
some self doubts,

33:55.734 --> 33:57.934
like maybe something
was wrong with me.

33:57.967 --> 33:59.533
Then I started thinking
about it,

33:59.567 --> 34:01.667
and nothing's wrong with me.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.967
Something's wrong with Jimmy
and with Ben

34:04.001 --> 34:06.633
and with any other guy
that doesn't like me,

34:06.667 --> 34:08.600
and if I wanted to,

34:08.632 --> 34:10.600
I could have the guy that
every girl in school wants,

34:10.632 --> 34:11.934
if I wanted.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.167
And that would be Ricky.

34:13.201 --> 34:14.867
Mm-hmm.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.134
So when he came over here
to help you practice,

34:17.167 --> 34:19.434
to build up your self-esteem,

34:19.467 --> 34:21.734
you just went along with that?

34:21.766 --> 34:24.500
Come on, Dad.
He isn't just helping me.

34:24.533 --> 34:25.699
He wanted to kiss me,

34:25.734 --> 34:28.134
and I wanted to kiss him,

34:28.167 --> 34:29.234
and I'm glad I did.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.734
You know why?

34:30.766 --> 34:35.467
Because it wasn't quite as
wonderful as I thought it might be.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.301
I was afraid that one kiss,
and I would crumble,

34:38.333 --> 34:39.800
and then what, he'd marry me?

34:39.833 --> 34:41.967
He's not the marrying kind.

34:42.001 --> 34:45.167
He's been a good dad, and I think
he'll always be a good dad to John,

34:45.201 --> 34:47.434
but he's not ready
to be a good husband.

34:47.467 --> 34:49.734
He's not even ready to be
a good boyfriend, obviously,

34:49.766 --> 34:52.368
or he wouldn't have kissed me.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.368
The thing is...

34:54.400 --> 34:57.101
I never even thought
about Adrian in all this.

34:57.134 --> 34:59.134
I never thought
how she'd feel about it.

34:59.167 --> 35:01.934
I never even considered it.

35:01.967 --> 35:05.500
And Adrian's been really nice
to me lately.

35:05.533 --> 35:09.267
She's been really nice to me
because she loves Ricky,

35:09.301 --> 35:10.600
and you know what?

35:10.633 --> 35:13.368
Even though he kissed me,

35:13.401 --> 35:15.134
I do think Ricky loves Adrian.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.334
You want me to help you
make up the sofa?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.034
Probably ready to go to bed,
aren't you?

35:21.067 --> 35:23.434
Might be sleeping
in the old bedroom tonight.

35:23.468 --> 35:25.468
Heard any rumors about me
and your mom getting remarried?

35:25.500 --> 35:26.667
No.

35:26.700 --> 35:27.834
Come on.
Dad...

35:27.867 --> 35:29.401
Apparently,
it's all over school.

35:29.434 --> 35:31.368
You know how things get around
that aren't true.

35:31.401 --> 35:33.567
I think it's true.
All right, well, if it is,

35:33.600 --> 35:35.167
then why don't you wait
for her to tell you.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.934
Right. You're right.

35:37.967 --> 35:39.533
Boy, Amy, you really are
growing up.

35:39.567 --> 35:41.267
Good night, Dad.
Good night.

35:41.301 --> 35:44.401
Oh, you know what?

35:44.434 --> 35:46.900
If Adrian wants
to be friends with you,

35:46.934 --> 35:48.767
then you let her
tell you that.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.301
What?
She has told me that.

35:50.334 --> 35:52.533
Well, let her keep
telling you that.

35:53.867 --> 35:55.401
Good night.

36:01.267 --> 36:02.567
[phone rings]

36:05.600 --> 36:08.167
Hi. So glad you called.
I was worried about you.

36:08.201 --> 36:09.468
Were you?

36:09.500 --> 36:10.834
<i>Yeah, I didn't want you
to do something crazy</i>

36:10.867 --> 36:13.434
<i>that you'd regret later.</i>

36:13.468 --> 36:16.167
Ben's parked in front of Amy's.

36:16.201 --> 36:18.201
He's just sitting in his car.

36:18.234 --> 36:20.101
Really? By himself?

36:20.134 --> 36:21.533
Yep.

36:21.567 --> 36:24.533
I hope he's not getting
back together with Amy.

36:24.567 --> 36:26.034
I really like him, Adrian.

36:26.067 --> 36:28.167
Oh, I doubt Amy wants
to get together with Ben

36:28.201 --> 36:30.867
since she's obviously
having sex with Ricky.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.201
I doubt it.

36:32.234 --> 36:33.368
I don't.

36:33.401 --> 36:35.167
Adrian, why else would Ben
be over there

36:35.201 --> 36:37.034
unless he wanted to get
back together with Amy?

36:37.067 --> 36:38.567
I mean, I don't want them
to get back together,

36:38.600 --> 36:39.700
but you know how it is.

36:39.734 --> 36:41.600
You break up with Ricky.
You get back with Ricky.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.368
You break up with Ricky. You get back
with Ricky. Okay, what's your point?

36:44.401 --> 36:46.734
Ben and Amy are probably
giving it another shot.

36:46.767 --> 36:48.368
They're probably trying
to get back together.

36:48.401 --> 36:49.800
They're not getting
back together

36:49.834 --> 36:51.600
because Amy is having sex
with Ricky.

36:51.633 --> 36:52.800
Okay, if they're not
getting back together,

36:52.834 --> 36:54.001
then what's Ben doing
over there?

36:54.034 --> 36:55.201
I don't know.

36:55.234 --> 36:57.867
Well, maybe he heard
she had sex with Ricky,

36:57.900 --> 36:59.167
and he's going to confront her,

36:59.201 --> 37:00.434
or he has confronted her.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.234
Or he's just sitting out
there because he misses her.

37:03.267 --> 37:04.934
It could be something
as simple as that.

37:04.967 --> 37:06.900
No, I don't think so.
Adrian...

37:06.934 --> 37:08.900
I'm going to go find out.
I'm going to call him.

37:08.934 --> 37:10.567
No, I tried calling him.
He's not picking up his phone.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.368
Maybe he'll pick up his phone
for me.

37:12.401 --> 37:14.368
I mean, this could be
the perfect opportunity

37:14.401 --> 37:15.401
to reach out to him.

37:15.434 --> 37:16.867
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.434
What?

37:18.468 --> 37:21.368
That this is a good time
to reach out to Ben.

37:21.401 --> 37:23.401
For me to reach out,
not you.

37:23.434 --> 37:25.334
I'm the one
who's interested in him.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.500
Didn't you get anything
out of the dance tonight?

37:27.533 --> 37:29.633
Yeah, I got
that girls are mean

37:29.667 --> 37:31.734
and competitive
and vindictive.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.134
But we don't have to be.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.500
You don't want to be
the meanest,

37:34.533 --> 37:36.834
most competitive,
most vindictive, do you?

37:36.867 --> 37:38.001
Are you kidding?

37:38.034 --> 37:39.700
If Amy slept with Ricky,
yeah.

37:39.734 --> 37:40.934
You don't know that,

37:40.967 --> 37:42.700
and if you want to get back
at Amy,

37:42.734 --> 37:43.934
get back at her with Ricky.

37:43.967 --> 37:45.134
Don't get back at her with Ben.

37:45.167 --> 37:47.368
He's still sitting out there.

37:47.401 --> 37:48.934
I'm going to go down
and see what's going on.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.900
Don't. Just don't do it,
Adrian, okay?

37:50.934 --> 37:53.567
Just walk over to Amy's and
talk to her and work it out.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.101
You two are friends.
You can do that.

37:55.134 --> 37:58.001
Oh, yeah, you see where
that got me. I have to go.

37:58.034 --> 37:59.834
Maybe she just had a condom

37:59.867 --> 38:01.334
because she wanted
to have a condom.

38:01.368 --> 38:02.867
It doesn't mean
she's having sex.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.500
Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.633
I have a condom,
and I'm not having sex.

38:06.667 --> 38:09.667
Just don't do anything until
you know what really happened.

38:09.700 --> 38:10.800
I know what happened.

38:10.834 --> 38:11.934
No, you don't.

38:11.967 --> 38:13.633
Good night, Grace.

38:15.067 --> 38:16.533
[sighs]

38:26.034 --> 38:29.500
Hey, your mom said the dance
was really interesting.

38:29.533 --> 38:31.434
Yeah, it was.

38:31.468 --> 38:33.468
So did you talk to Ricky?

38:33.500 --> 38:36.301
[sighs]
He did come over here.

38:36.334 --> 38:39.468
No, it didn't come
over here. Why?

38:39.500 --> 38:41.267
He was supposed to come
over here.

38:41.301 --> 38:42.500
He said he was coming
over here?

38:42.533 --> 38:44.667
Yeah, I saw him
over at George's earlier.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.867
Well, you know Ricky.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.201
Yeah, I do know Ricky
and guys like Ricky

38:49.234 --> 38:51.067
and guys in general,

38:51.101 --> 38:52.434
and, Adrian,

38:52.468 --> 38:54.167
I don't know if we should've
asked Ricky's parents

38:54.201 --> 38:55.267
to be part of our wedding.

38:55.301 --> 38:56.567
We don't really know them.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.633
Someone
has to be the witnesses.

38:57.667 --> 38:58.900
It might as well be them.

38:58.934 --> 39:01.167
We can't force a guy to
bring you around his family

39:01.201 --> 39:02.468
if he's not ready for that.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.301
Yes, you can
if you have to.

39:04.334 --> 39:05.334
You don't have to.

39:05.368 --> 39:07.301
You can wait
until he really wants to

39:07.334 --> 39:08.834
because until
he really wants to,

39:08.867 --> 39:11.067
he might be feeling pressured,

39:11.101 --> 39:13.034
and it might make him run
in the other direction.

39:13.067 --> 39:15.101
Like next door?

39:15.134 --> 39:17.267
The guy's got a lot of issues.
You know that.

39:17.301 --> 39:19.468
I know that,

39:19.500 --> 39:21.201
and thanks for talking
about it, Dad.

39:21.234 --> 39:23.401
Well, if Ricky does talk
about it,

39:23.434 --> 39:24.967
and I think he will,

39:25.001 --> 39:27.368
I'll be around if you need
to talk some more, okay?

39:27.401 --> 39:28.867
Thanks.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.667
Good night, Adrian.
I love you.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.834
Good night.
Love you, too.

39:55.167 --> 39:56.234
Hi, Adrian.

39:56.267 --> 39:58.134
Hi, Ben.
I saw you from my room.

39:58.167 --> 39:59.633
What are you doing out here?

40:00.633 --> 40:04.267
Just, uh, thinking
about things.

40:04.301 --> 40:07.101
Could you use some company?

40:07.134 --> 40:09.967
You know, I could.

40:26.468 --> 40:28.633
[buzzing]

40:33.368 --> 40:35.967
<i>[on voice mail] Hi, this is
Adrian. You know what to do.</i>

40:41.834 --> 40:43.567
[typing]

40:52.134 --> 40:54.167
[ringing]
