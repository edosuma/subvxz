WEBVTT

01:06.444 --> 01:07.444
No!

02:19.507 --> 02:22.558
"TV drama." Eight letters. Down.

02:23.257 --> 02:25.451
Uh... St. Elsewhere.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.439
Morning, sunshine!

02:34.634 --> 02:36.133
Where am I?

02:36.168 --> 02:37.632
Tenerife.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.621
Which is, uh, the Canary Islands.

02:41.133 --> 02:42.548
We're almost there.

02:43.197 --> 02:43.874
Where?

02:43.922 --> 02:48.017
Hey, what kind of clubs
do they have in Morocco?

02:48.041 --> 02:49.580
We're not going to Morocco.

02:49.604 --> 02:50.143
Come on.

02:50.167 --> 02:50.836
On the way back?

02:50.910 --> 02:52.956
On the way back from where?

02:52.980 --> 02:55.523
Oh, I'm sorry, they only
gave you a one-way ticket.

02:56.096 --> 02:57.335
Who "they"?

02:58.437 --> 02:59.706
Here's the deal:

02:59.774 --> 03:01.631
We jump into Casablanca,

03:01.681 --> 03:04.645
hit Rick's Cafe for a
little, uh, cocktail.

03:04.669 --> 03:06.760
I could tickle the ivories.
"Here's looking at you, kid."

03:06.784 --> 03:09.019
And then we're back
to D. C., nobody knows.

03:09.043 --> 03:10.518
Who are you people?!

03:11.417 --> 03:12.417
Couriers.

03:12.607 --> 03:16.572
Delivering a package as a
favor to our Israeli friends.

03:17.607 --> 03:18.472
Package, huh?

03:18.514 --> 03:20.330
Don't take it personal...

03:20.354 --> 03:21.354
Goliath.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.395
Yeah, can I ask you about that?

03:23.419 --> 03:24.895
Every arms dealer I meet, they have

03:24.919 --> 03:26.754
the cheesiest code names.

03:26.794 --> 03:29.333
I mean, "Goliath" did you choose that?

03:29.357 --> 03:30.652
You are CIA, yes?

03:36.877 --> 03:38.261
Oh, this should be interesting.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.576
Goliath, I'd like you to meet
one of our Israeli friends.

03:42.945 --> 03:43.804
You are a traitor,

03:43.865 --> 03:45.735
to our country and our people.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.319
I have never sell weapons
to Hamas or Hezbollah!

03:49.073 --> 03:50.805
You sell to people who do.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.711
You're lucky she doesn't
have her slingshot.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.586
Still waiting for clearance to take off.

03:57.610 --> 03:59.272
The pilot says we'll
only be on the ground

03:59.296 --> 04:01.272
for a couple of minutes
when we reach Zaire.

04:01.296 --> 04:04.524
It's much too dangerous
to stay there any longer.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.548
Zaire?

04:06.673 --> 04:07.900
You're taking me to Zaire?

04:07.924 --> 04:11.054
You sold a shipment
of RPGs to their army.

04:11.423 --> 04:13.963
They were very disappointed with
the quality of the merchandise.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.036
I believe the President of Zaire himself

04:16.081 --> 04:18.464
is eager to discuss how you stiffed him.

04:18.488 --> 04:20.837
He, in turn, has some
information Mossad needs.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.463
And we owe Mossad a little favor

04:22.487 --> 04:24.463
'cause they told us you
were in D. C., and...

04:24.487 --> 04:25.662
so here we are.

04:25.923 --> 04:27.650
We deliver you to Zaire,

04:27.674 --> 04:29.526
the President gives the
Israelis whatever information

04:29.550 --> 04:31.839
they want, and everyone is happy.

04:31.863 --> 04:34.908
Well, not everyone.

04:34.943 --> 04:37.311
We've been cleared for
takeoff. Fasten your seatbelts.

04:37.391 --> 04:41.227
Please, I-I am very wealthy.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.669
I have diamonds.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.508
You, uh, had diamonds.

04:45.582 --> 04:47.439
This jet is very expensive,

04:47.513 --> 04:49.370
and somebody had to pay for it.

04:50.425 --> 04:51.485
I know things.

04:51.551 --> 04:52.341
Yeah.

04:52.365 --> 04:54.510
How to trade weapons for
diamonds, we got that.

04:56.177 --> 04:57.832
I'll trade information.

05:00.490 --> 05:04.275
And what could you know
that would interest the CIA?

05:05.927 --> 05:07.752
He thinks we're the CIA?

05:09.958 --> 05:11.061
Why not?

05:11.105 --> 05:14.898
CIA, FBI, NSA what
difference does it make?

05:14.955 --> 05:18.286
I have information to trade for my life.

05:23.053 --> 05:24.053
ARES.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.029
Cancer.

05:26.053 --> 05:26.905
Virgo.

05:26.929 --> 05:27.929
Scorpio.

05:30.118 --> 05:32.719
No, your Navy's encrypted
satellite system.

05:32.743 --> 05:33.743
Not my Navy.

05:34.303 --> 05:35.491
The American Navy.

05:35.541 --> 05:38.844
They use it to send target
coordinates to cruise missiles.

05:38.868 --> 05:41.458
Did you get that out of Jane's, Goliath?

05:41.671 --> 05:43.263
What if Iran possessed it?

05:43.336 --> 05:45.301
Or North Korea?

05:45.430 --> 05:46.430
In the war,

05:46.619 --> 05:49.219
they could intercept and change
cruise missile coordinates,

05:49.243 --> 05:51.368
send them to Tel Aviv, Seoul,

05:52.181 --> 05:54.011
or even return to sender.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.656
But they don't have ARES.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.657
Sit back, relax,

05:57.681 --> 06:00.721
and try to enjoy the rest
of your miserable life.

06:01.432 --> 06:02.727
ARES is for sale.

06:05.496 --> 06:07.321
I know who's selling it.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.158
The guy we're after is Charles Harrow.

06:12.182 --> 06:15.033
There should be an e-mail
from him on Goliath's computer.

06:15.057 --> 06:16.597
Charles Harrow, right.

06:16.994 --> 06:18.524
We have to tell him.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.746
Tell me what?

06:19.996 --> 06:22.409
Wow, Gibbs, nothing
wrong with your hearing.

06:22.433 --> 06:24.222
Boss, this may take awhile.

06:24.246 --> 06:26.971
Hey, McGee, even I
can download an e-mail.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.534
Well, you know your
user name and password.

06:29.558 --> 06:31.429
We haven't even penetrated Goliath's

06:31.472 --> 06:33.034
screen saver yet, Gibbs.

06:33.058 --> 06:36.276
Which is a bitchin'
picture of a Greek island.

06:36.566 --> 06:37.758
At least, I think it's a Greek island.

06:37.782 --> 06:40.660
It's definitely the Aegean
Sea. That blue is too...

06:40.684 --> 06:42.685
Paragon.

06:44.497 --> 06:45.785
Hey! I was just doing

06:45.809 --> 06:47.225
what Gibbs would do if he was here.

06:47.249 --> 06:49.614
"Paragon" is Goliath's user name.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.160
Okay, uh, boss, you
wouldn't happen to have...

06:54.184 --> 06:57.829
Delta, seven, one, Zulu,
three, nine, Kilo, five.

07:00.311 --> 07:01.877
Huh. We're in.

07:01.912 --> 07:03.708
Gibbs, you slayed Goliath!

07:03.748 --> 07:06.463
Well, Abbs, it was either him or you.

07:16.874 --> 07:18.288
This isn't Tenerife.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.076
Well, I told them to
take a left at Bermuda.

07:30.564 --> 07:31.564
This is Tony.

07:32.313 --> 07:34.023
Boss, found that e-mail.

07:34.313 --> 07:37.096
Harrow has a villa for
sale on Santorini. That's...

07:37.149 --> 07:38.790
- Greek island in the Aegean.
- Right.

07:38.814 --> 07:41.260
And he's asking $20 million, but Goliath

07:41.301 --> 07:42.949
- doesn't want to pay more than...
- Fifteen.

07:42.973 --> 07:45.459
But, uh, but I don't
think that the villa...

07:45.503 --> 07:47.093
Is what he's selling.

07:47.378 --> 07:48.378
Right.

07:49.564 --> 07:52.041
So I've pulled
everything that I can find

07:52.065 --> 07:53.840
on Charles Andrew Harrow.

07:54.191 --> 07:56.856
Age 68, civilian encryption specialist,

07:56.880 --> 07:59.979
employed by the DOD until
he retired three years ago.

08:00.003 --> 08:02.167
His most notable project was...

08:02.191 --> 08:03.883
ARES. Top secret Navy
encrypted satellite

08:03.935 --> 08:05.784
targeting system named after...

08:05.826 --> 08:07.236
Greek god of war.

08:07.692 --> 08:08.692
Right.

08:09.941 --> 08:10.941
That all?

08:11.441 --> 08:12.441
No.

08:12.630 --> 08:13.767
No, I'm also, uh,

08:13.815 --> 08:16.031
running Harrow's phone
and e-mail records

08:16.079 --> 08:18.982
for the past 90 days against
databases of known arms dealers.

08:19.006 --> 08:20.919
No hits yet, but I did just start.

08:20.943 --> 08:23.107
205 Rosewood Drive, Northwest D. C.

08:23.131 --> 08:24.482
Is that address still good?

08:24.506 --> 08:25.621
Far as I know.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.646
DiNozzo, Ziva, go get him.

08:31.129 --> 08:32.129
Uh, Gibbs...

08:37.756 --> 08:38.756
McGee.

08:38.943 --> 08:39.943
Right.

08:43.241 --> 08:44.219
I'm telling you,

08:44.256 --> 08:46.420
my pulse is racing, Doctor.

08:46.444 --> 08:47.669
My heart is throbbing.

08:47.693 --> 08:51.209
I've done a self-diagnosis
here, and, uh, it's not good.

08:51.278 --> 08:53.898
I need some relief from the good doctor.

08:55.945 --> 08:56.945
I got to go.

08:58.134 --> 08:59.429
I was just, um...

08:59.819 --> 09:01.759
I got to go back to work.

09:08.760 --> 09:09.960
These streets are like a maze.

09:09.995 --> 09:12.236
I told you I couldn't
program the navigator.

09:12.260 --> 09:12.880
I'm a driver.

09:12.915 --> 09:14.433
Ziva, I've driven with you before.

09:14.486 --> 09:16.141
I'd rather be lost than dead.

09:18.135 --> 09:21.081
205 Rosewood Drive,
Northwest. That's it.

09:21.155 --> 09:22.996
It's the one with a car
pulling out of the driveway.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.798
We could race ahead, swerve right,

09:24.822 --> 09:26.827
brake hard and cut him off.

09:26.948 --> 09:29.029
Or we could just wait for him to stop.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.107
Uploading Goliath's file
into the database, boss.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.825
Briefing paper?

09:37.949 --> 09:38.924
Done.

09:38.948 --> 09:40.362
Audio of interrogation?

09:40.386 --> 09:41.631
Being transcribed.

09:42.761 --> 09:44.675
You know, Goliath's right, boss.

09:44.699 --> 09:45.999
Iran, North Korea,

09:46.448 --> 09:47.861
even some of our allies

09:47.885 --> 09:50.192
would pay a fortune to
get their hands on ARES.

09:51.264 --> 09:52.859
Do you think, DiNozzo?

10:01.574 --> 10:05.426
Looks like McGee's got a name
match off of Harrow's e-mails.

10:05.450 --> 10:06.450
Trent Kort.

10:07.262 --> 10:10.212
He's on the FBI arms dealer watch list.

10:11.076 --> 10:12.076
How old?

10:12.139 --> 10:13.199
Uh, five days.

10:14.450 --> 10:15.690
McGee's computer.

10:18.140 --> 10:19.195
Ah, bio's thin.

10:19.248 --> 10:21.052
Trent Thomas Kort, 37 years old,

10:21.076 --> 10:23.116
British national, believed to have

10:23.140 --> 10:24.385
recently joined...

10:27.013 --> 10:28.958
Smile was for me, dear boy.

10:37.327 --> 10:38.681
You know this guy?

10:39.391 --> 10:41.281
No, never seen him before.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.265
Hawaiian shirts.

10:44.642 --> 10:46.868
Believed to have recently
joined La Grenouille,

10:46.892 --> 10:48.188
an international arms dealer,

10:48.230 --> 10:50.743
fronting corporations in Paris,

10:50.767 --> 10:53.378
Nairobi, Cape Town.

11:07.294 --> 11:08.294
I know...

11:09.669 --> 11:10.669
Uh... sorry.

11:10.751 --> 11:12.238
Cynthia wasn't at her desk, so...

11:12.285 --> 11:14.145
So you barged in, DiNozzo?

11:14.853 --> 11:16.585
That should hold until
you get home, Director.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.932
Thank you, Cynthia.

11:22.411 --> 11:25.664
I broke a bra strap and I had

11:25.795 --> 11:28.506
Cynthia get me a safety pin.

11:29.163 --> 11:31.272
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.531
To ease the awkwardness of the moment.

11:34.732 --> 11:36.584
We know each other so well, Tony,

11:36.608 --> 11:38.678
there are no awkward moments.

11:39.796 --> 11:40.434
Yeah.

11:40.481 --> 11:41.982
May I?

11:47.131 --> 11:48.196
Charles Harrow.

11:48.754 --> 11:50.944
- Retired puzzle maker.
- For who?

11:51.694 --> 11:53.363
Us. Literally us.

11:53.411 --> 11:54.650
He designed ARES.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.161
It's the Navy's crus...

11:56.202 --> 11:59.177
missile targeting system.
He come out of retirement?

12:00.192 --> 12:01.192
In a way.

12:01.318 --> 12:02.318
He's offering ARES

12:02.356 --> 12:04.698
in a one-off to the highest bidder.

12:05.819 --> 12:06.824
La Grenouille?

12:07.019 --> 12:09.232
He's one of the bidders.

12:09.256 --> 12:10.670
How did we come by this?

12:10.694 --> 12:12.939
Mossad passed intel on to Ziva

12:13.007 --> 12:14.736
about an international arms dealer,

12:14.760 --> 12:16.120
code name, Goliath.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.982
I've heard of him. He's Israeli.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.988
And Ziva didn't take too kindly to that.

12:22.012 --> 12:23.427
He's rumored to be bidding

12:23.451 --> 12:25.364
on a stolen Navy weapons system.

12:25.388 --> 12:27.052
We snatched him this morning.

12:27.076 --> 12:28.989
Got him downstairs on a visa violation

12:29.013 --> 12:31.054
and his computer's in Abby's lab.

12:31.078 --> 12:32.078
And...

12:32.513 --> 12:34.489
We were running Harrow's cell calls

12:34.513 --> 12:36.679
and e-mails for known
arms dealers when...

12:36.703 --> 12:39.714
this guy popped
off an FBI watch list.

12:41.139 --> 12:42.909
His name is Trent Kart.

12:43.578 --> 12:45.325
You took that picture eight weeks ago.

12:45.374 --> 12:46.952
Why are we just getting a name now?

12:46.998 --> 12:48.532
I have no idea.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.594
I ran that photo against
all agency watch lists,

12:51.659 --> 12:53.587
including the FBI and I got nothing.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.305
Doesn't matter.

12:57.330 --> 12:58.330
This is good.

12:58.890 --> 12:59.945
And it's bad.

13:00.204 --> 13:01.302
I had to lie to Gibbs.

13:01.382 --> 13:03.378
You were on an undercover mission.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.742
- He's my boss.
- And I'm his boss.

13:05.766 --> 13:07.180
You leave him to me.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.432
Your ass is covered.

13:08.456 --> 13:10.512
I'm not worried about my ass, Jenny.

13:12.766 --> 13:14.895
Gibbs put Harrow under surveillance?

13:14.948 --> 13:15.989
No.

13:16.706 --> 13:17.706
No?

13:17.891 --> 13:19.949
He sent Ziva and McGee to pick him up.

13:20.892 --> 13:23.730
Cynthia, get Agent Gibbs in here ASAP.

13:27.642 --> 13:29.757
You sent for me, director?

13:31.831 --> 13:33.601
Call Ziva and McGee off.

13:34.830 --> 13:36.537
Off, director?

13:36.584 --> 13:38.526
They are not to pick up...

13:39.518 --> 13:40.518
Harrow.

13:40.833 --> 13:41.833
Harrow.

13:45.148 --> 13:47.226
Charles Harrow is offering a top secret

13:47.268 --> 13:49.963
Navy weapons system
to the highest bidder.

13:50.082 --> 13:52.018
It could be in the
hands of Iraq or China...

13:52.060 --> 13:54.629
Dammed Jethro! This is
an order. Call them off!

13:59.646 --> 14:00.747
Just when you begin

14:00.771 --> 14:02.621
to assimilate to American culture

14:02.645 --> 14:04.996
you see a grown man
getting his nails done.

14:05.020 --> 14:06.307
There's nothing wrong with a man

14:06.355 --> 14:09.458
treating himself to a manicure.

14:11.271 --> 14:12.861
Don't tell me, McGee.

14:16.178 --> 14:18.201
I have sensitive cuticles.

14:36.434 --> 14:38.732
- It's Gibbs.
- Answer it.

14:38.772 --> 14:39.772
Yeah, boss?

14:43.963 --> 14:44.963
Yes?

14:45.773 --> 14:46.963
Uh, sweet cheeks, it's okay.

14:47.006 --> 14:48.096
We're all set.

14:49.150 --> 14:50.150
We are?

14:50.214 --> 14:52.328
Yeah, my brother just
called to give me directions.

14:52.373 --> 14:54.215
The Washington Monument,

14:54.274 --> 14:56.163
who'd have thought it'd
be so tough to find?

14:56.187 --> 14:58.082
- Thanks anyway.
- No problem.

14:59.436 --> 15:00.538
What just happened?

15:00.562 --> 15:01.742
Change of plans.

15:03.127 --> 15:04.842
Follow, do not approach.

15:13.062 --> 15:14.603
You haven't been straight
with me since I...

15:14.627 --> 15:15.692
- Quit?
- Retired.

15:16.063 --> 15:18.054
When you left on your margarita safari,

15:18.094 --> 15:19.591
Margarita safari?

15:19.642 --> 15:21.939
This agency didn't shut down.

15:22.002 --> 15:24.539
New operations were put in motion.

15:24.563 --> 15:26.930
- One sent Tony undercover.
- Well, I'm back,

15:26.972 --> 15:29.416
and I won't have a
part-time senior field agent.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.643
It's your own fault, you know.

15:30.686 --> 15:32.677
For what? Leaving or coming back?

15:32.729 --> 15:35.164
For teaching me your rules.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.604
Best way to keep a secret:

15:37.628 --> 15:40.053
Keep it to yourself. Second best:

15:40.378 --> 15:42.712
Tell one other person if you must.

15:43.566 --> 15:45.276
There is no third best.

15:45.943 --> 15:47.666
That's rule number four, isn't it?

15:47.690 --> 15:51.089
Number One supersedes all of the others.

15:51.132 --> 15:53.434
Never screw your partner?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.771
Never screw over your partner.

16:00.316 --> 16:02.146
I never screwed you over.

16:02.757 --> 16:04.417
And I'm not your partner.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.036
I'm your boss.

16:11.758 --> 16:13.857
McGee's search is kicking
out another bidder.

16:13.881 --> 16:14.881
Hey, boss?

16:15.883 --> 16:17.478
McGee's got something.

16:18.632 --> 16:20.382
What is it with these wacky code names?

16:20.429 --> 16:21.607
Anonymity deflects

16:21.631 --> 16:23.701
more bullets than body armor.

16:24.757 --> 16:26.227
This one's a woman.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.938
The Black Rose.

16:28.635 --> 16:29.416
Rose O'Leary.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.295
She ran guns for the IRA

16:31.319 --> 16:32.914
until peace broke out.

16:32.943 --> 16:34.568
- Who's flagged her?
- MI-5.

16:35.176 --> 16:36.472
They were tracking her in Africa.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.795
Lost contact six days ago.

16:38.819 --> 16:40.120
They think she slipped aboard a Varig

16:40.144 --> 16:43.171
flight to Brazil using
the name Grace O'Malley.

16:45.011 --> 16:46.666
That's funny, director?

16:46.695 --> 16:48.060
Grace O'Malley

16:48.107 --> 16:50.685
was a 16th century Irish pirate.

16:52.696 --> 16:53.871
What's her bid?

16:53.946 --> 16:55.548
Less than La Grenouille.

16:55.572 --> 16:56.572
Only 18 mil.

16:57.137 --> 16:59.202
Unless her bid was in euros.

17:02.010 --> 17:03.010
Dollars.

17:03.321 --> 17:04.675
It was in dollars.

17:05.695 --> 17:08.056
You think he'll ever forgive us?

17:08.200 --> 17:11.204
Send me a hard copy when the data's in.

17:12.762 --> 17:15.063
Yeah, that's what I think, too.

17:31.889 --> 17:33.129
You following me?

17:34.323 --> 17:36.148
No. Why would I do that?

17:37.016 --> 17:39.681
Just asking myself the same question.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.335
Want me to run some water?

17:48.639 --> 17:50.551
No, I'm all right, I just...

17:50.575 --> 17:52.465
Ah, just say it, DiNozzo.

17:52.890 --> 17:54.125
I'm sorry, boss.

17:54.951 --> 17:55.951
I, uh...

17:56.575 --> 17:58.055
I've been wanting to
tell you for a long time,

17:58.079 --> 17:59.117
but, the situation is...

17:59.141 --> 18:00.141
Complicated?

18:01.451 --> 18:02.451
Exactly.

18:02.928 --> 18:04.132
Director's got this really strict

18:04.156 --> 18:06.616
- rule about...
- Secrets?

18:08.140 --> 18:09.140
Yeah.

18:10.576 --> 18:11.837
The point is, I owe you everything.

18:11.861 --> 18:13.409
You taught me how to do this job.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.495
And I never wanted to lie to you.

18:15.549 --> 18:17.152
Well, DiNozzo, you
were following orders.

18:17.198 --> 18:18.308
I'd have done the same thing.

18:18.332 --> 18:19.551
- Would you?
- Yeah.

18:19.604 --> 18:21.533
You would've lied to Mike Franks?

18:54.969 --> 18:56.342
You know, they pretend
and they do a little

18:56.366 --> 18:58.442
different, you know?
But it's all the same.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.057
I want to see what you
want to say about it.

19:00.081 --> 19:03.418
Uh, look, uh, will settle
something for me and my friends.

19:03.466 --> 19:05.651
We really need a woman's point of view.

19:05.692 --> 19:06.860
Hey, go ask your mom.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.503
It's a simple question.

19:08.556 --> 19:09.895
Let go of me.

19:09.941 --> 19:10.662
See, I told you.

19:10.697 --> 19:12.464
All beautiful women are bitches.

19:19.768 --> 19:21.129
He's spoted us!

20:00.136 --> 20:02.617
We've got a man down
with a heart attack.

20:02.683 --> 20:04.485
In front of the steps.

20:13.967 --> 20:15.879
You were suppose to keep Mr. Harrow

20:15.903 --> 20:18.261
under surveillance, not
chase him into a coronary.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.060
Director, once he made us

20:20.108 --> 20:22.068
we had to take him
into custody, didn't we?

20:22.092 --> 20:24.351
No, the director is right.
We could've let Harrow escape.

20:24.398 --> 20:25.604
If he sold ARES, we could've caught.

20:25.628 --> 20:27.944
Black Rose, La grenouille,
Iran or Syria...

20:27.991 --> 20:29.837
Don't get cute Officer David.

20:29.885 --> 20:31.731
I'm saying there had to be a better way.

20:31.789 --> 20:32.858
Right, Tony?

20:33.288 --> 20:35.288
That's right, Director. They've could...

20:35.312 --> 20:35.964
Shot him.

20:35.988 --> 20:37.044
That's right, they could've shot him.

20:37.068 --> 20:39.442
Of course in high octane situations,

20:39.466 --> 20:41.069
Ziva will reverse back
to her Mossad training,

20:41.093 --> 20:43.827
and probably would've put
a round through his heart.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.612
- Three rounds.
- And McGee,

20:45.636 --> 20:46.968
Not to be outdone would've...

20:46.992 --> 20:47.992
Added three more rounds.

20:48.969 --> 20:49.969
- Gibbs.
- See?

20:50.594 --> 20:51.594
There you go.

20:52.095 --> 20:53.750
Six rounds, same result:

20:54.095 --> 20:56.296
One dead Mr. Harrow.

20:56.470 --> 20:58.629
I signed for the body. Cause of death

20:58.653 --> 21:00.248
was most likely, uh...

21:01.405 --> 21:03.089
am I interrupting?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.010
Not at all, doctor.

21:05.096 --> 21:07.196
We were just discussing the various ways

21:07.220 --> 21:09.072
NCIS could have killed Mr. Harrow

21:09.096 --> 21:11.166
besides chasing him to death.

21:11.657 --> 21:14.631
- I am interrupting.
- Doctor, "death was most

21:14.655 --> 21:16.599
likely caused by"?

21:16.634 --> 21:18.190
A myocardial infarction.

21:18.848 --> 21:21.770
Most probably brought
on by a combination

21:21.833 --> 21:23.634
of a high-fat Western diet,

21:23.658 --> 21:25.198
little exercise and the mistaken

21:25.222 --> 21:27.574
belief that he could
run up all those stairs.

21:27.598 --> 21:30.498
Rigorous for most, rigor mortis for him.

21:31.158 --> 21:32.345
Anything else?

21:32.416 --> 21:34.279
Not until I do the autopsy.

21:38.223 --> 21:39.605
What is going on?

21:39.651 --> 21:41.639
I think the director is
afraid Harrow's family

21:41.691 --> 21:42.892
might sue us.

21:42.940 --> 21:45.844
Well, whatever she's
thinking about, it's not ARES.

21:48.157 --> 21:49.157
That's ARES?

21:49.534 --> 21:50.954
According to McGeek.

21:51.974 --> 21:53.338
Ziva! Watch the road!

21:53.373 --> 21:54.613
I have great peripheral vision.

21:54.661 --> 21:55.557
My sphincter doesn't.

21:55.603 --> 21:57.539
Well, at least we won't
have trouble finding it.

21:57.574 --> 21:58.972
Really?

21:59.019 --> 22:00.793
Tony, it's the size of an ATM!

22:02.162 --> 22:05.316
Well, this is the
controller console, and is...

22:06.185 --> 22:08.958
- Your mystery woman!
- Watch the road.

22:08.993 --> 22:11.283
Oh, yes it is, isn't it?

22:11.330 --> 22:12.621
No, this is no one.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.532
This is McGee's idea of a prank.

22:14.574 --> 22:17.969
This is the pirated part
of ARES we have to find.

22:17.993 --> 22:20.210
$20 million for that?!

22:21.562 --> 22:23.010
Well, size doesn't matter.

22:24.884 --> 22:27.194
Forget I even stupidly
started to say that.

22:33.266 --> 22:34.216
Will you tell me her name

22:34.278 --> 22:35.696
if I find the pirate's copy of ARES?

22:35.720 --> 22:37.698
- Pirated copy.
- That was I said.

22:37.739 --> 22:39.347
No, you said "pirate's copy."

22:39.410 --> 22:41.282
A pirate is a person
like Captain Jack Sparrow.

22:41.317 --> 22:43.112
- A pirated copy...
- Who is Jack Sparrow?

22:43.159 --> 22:45.798
- Johnny Depp.
- He's a pirate?

22:45.833 --> 22:47.751
No, he's an actor.

22:48.345 --> 22:50.156
- How did we get here?
- I drove.

22:59.213 --> 23:02.843
This is going to be like looking
for a needle in a needle stack.

23:03.438 --> 23:04.851
Needle in a haystack.

23:04.903 --> 23:07.442
I like my description better.

23:29.194 --> 23:32.708
Sitting in the dark, staring
at photos of your enemies

23:33.643 --> 23:35.846
could be considered obsessive.

23:36.844 --> 23:38.556
Kind of like building a fourth boat,

23:38.611 --> 23:40.939
when you haven't even
sailed the first three.

23:41.591 --> 23:43.731
How well do you know the Black Rose?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.586
Well, enough to know that I'd like her

23:45.610 --> 23:47.381
if she wasn't an arms dealer.

23:48.110 --> 23:50.123
And the Frog?

23:53.079 --> 23:54.825
La Grenouille.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.858
It means "the frog."

23:56.900 --> 23:58.538
I know what it means.

23:58.585 --> 24:00.340
Then why don't you call him that?

24:00.419 --> 24:04.176
La Grenouille is his code name.

24:04.222 --> 24:05.765
Well,

24:06.491 --> 24:08.444
I'm going to call him "Frog."

24:14.677 --> 24:16.860
Spit it out, Jethro, before it gags you.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.145
You were out of control today.

24:18.197 --> 24:19.439
Why?

24:19.474 --> 24:21.723
The deal died with Harrow.

24:22.908 --> 24:25.092
His copy of ARES might still be in play.

24:25.144 --> 24:27.041
You don't want ARES, you want him.

24:27.093 --> 24:28.706
Damn right, I want him!

24:28.750 --> 24:30.248
I have been trying for a decade

24:30.291 --> 24:32.334
to bring him down.

24:33.599 --> 24:34.954
So it is personal.

24:37.413 --> 24:39.687
What did he do to you, Jenny?

24:41.443 --> 24:44.368
You have no need to
know, Special Agent Gibbs.

24:58.625 --> 25:00.990
Wow, McGee, this is like
Christmas all over again.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.082
Look at this baby.

25:04.135 --> 25:05.764
Firewire, USB...

25:05.832 --> 25:07.221
a terabyte of storage...

25:07.265 --> 25:09.203
That's a thousand gigabytes of fun.

25:09.262 --> 25:10.830
No, to be accurate,

25:10.910 --> 25:13.524
it's 1,024 gigabytes of fun.

25:13.614 --> 25:15.214
And I bet you all of them are encrypted.

25:15.779 --> 25:17.665
It could take us years
to access all this stuff

25:17.728 --> 25:18.643
on these computers.

25:18.719 --> 25:20.431
You didn't think it was
going to be easy, did you?

25:20.455 --> 25:22.313
Hoping I'd get lucky.

25:25.215 --> 25:27.491
Guess I wasn't the only
one hoping to get lucky.

25:31.467 --> 25:32.909
These have been opened and resealed.

25:37.725 --> 25:39.482
SD micro-drives.

25:39.843 --> 25:40.630
Six of them.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.011
ARES.

25:42.851 --> 25:44.214
The software portion.

25:44.256 --> 25:45.856
We still need to find the circuit board.

25:48.191 --> 25:49.814
It's got to be here somewhere.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.752
I guess everything can't
be state of the art.

25:55.803 --> 25:57.893
That laptop's got to
be nearly 20 years old.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.851
Hey, maybe it has the
original Donkey Kong on it.

26:03.566 --> 26:04.566
McGee...

26:05.213 --> 26:08.397
how can a 20-year-old computer
have dual firewire connections?

26:08.456 --> 26:10.041
It can't.

26:10.117 --> 26:12.291
Firewire's only been
around about ten years.

26:12.326 --> 26:14.854
Somebody should have told Harrow.

26:17.386 --> 26:19.579
Sure looks like an old luggable.

26:22.044 --> 26:24.842
All right, should take
at least 30 seconds...

26:24.899 --> 26:26.394
for this to...

26:29.669 --> 26:32.125
That cunning old fox, he put
a new computer in an old skin.

26:32.188 --> 26:34.489
I like this guy.

26:34.672 --> 26:35.268
I mean,

26:35.315 --> 26:37.589
aside from the fact that he
was about to commit treason.

26:37.715 --> 26:39.567
That's the same screensaver

26:39.625 --> 26:41.074
that Goliath had.

26:41.734 --> 26:44.389
I bet you the circuitry to run ARES

26:44.980 --> 26:46.548
is hardwired into the motherboard.

26:47.061 --> 26:48.674
Abbs, I think we found ARES.

26:48.924 --> 26:50.711
Yes!

26:53.489 --> 26:58.164
The software was stored on
micro-drives hidden in condoms.

26:58.229 --> 27:01.430
We analyzed every
detail, the source code,

27:01.499 --> 27:02.758
to the circuitry of the motherboard...

27:02.782 --> 27:03.910
McGee.

27:04.610 --> 27:07.615
It's like PS-3, you
can't play "Killzone"

27:07.704 --> 27:09.517
without the hardware to run it.

27:09.582 --> 27:11.188
PS-3?

27:11.892 --> 27:12.892
Game console.

27:13.050 --> 27:14.050
Atari?

27:14.606 --> 27:16.549
Commodore 64.

27:16.629 --> 27:18.756
Software is useless without the hardware.

27:18.814 --> 27:20.687
- You got it.
- Why didn't you just say that?

27:20.755 --> 27:22.407
You found ARES?

27:22.737 --> 27:24.627
Yes, here it is, Director.

27:24.861 --> 27:26.451
Live from Abby's lab.

27:27.476 --> 27:29.421
You don't seem very happy.

27:30.159 --> 27:31.219
Any more bids?

27:31.503 --> 27:32.696
Nope.

27:32.731 --> 27:33.894
La Grenouille was the high one.

27:33.918 --> 27:34.785
Not that it matters.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.304
Get Harrow we will arrange the drop-off

27:36.328 --> 27:37.743
I checked his Blackberry.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.446
This guy writes down every appointment

27:39.504 --> 27:40.687
and meeting, nothing.

27:40.747 --> 27:43.968
No phone calls or e-mails in the
last six hours before he died.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.940
We were monitoring his...

27:48.766 --> 27:50.133
He had coffee.

27:53.832 --> 27:55.130
The cafe had internet access.

27:55.768 --> 27:56.768
Trimana Cafe,

27:57.053 --> 27:58.341
35th Street.

27:59.082 --> 27:59.667
Got it.

27:59.833 --> 28:01.293
ISP provider...

28:03.143 --> 28:05.119
Can you do this to anyone's e-mail?

28:05.143 --> 28:07.583
No, because this is highly illegal

28:07.630 --> 28:09.873
and I'm not even doing it now.

28:10.518 --> 28:11.693
Okay, we're in.

28:12.332 --> 28:15.734
At 1:40 this afternoon,
Harrow sent two emails

28:15.792 --> 28:19.236
from that ISP, one to Black Rose...

28:19.270 --> 28:21.309
Telling her the bad news, no doubt.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.163
And one to La Grenouille.

28:23.519 --> 28:26.645
"Congratulations on the winning
bid. Upon receipt of your funds,

28:26.692 --> 28:28.943
title to the
Santorini Villa at"-

28:29.087 --> 28:31.217
he lists the GPS coordinates-

28:31.271 --> 28:33.084
"will be transferred
at midnight, Tuesday."

28:33.834 --> 28:35.188
That's ten minutes from now.

28:35.212 --> 28:36.621
Same time zone as Israel.

28:36.645 --> 28:39.219
McGee, put that email up on the plasma.

28:44.837 --> 28:47.382
Those coordinates aren't in Greece.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.525
It's Quebec.

28:56.930 --> 28:59.058
We've got five hours.

28:59.093 --> 29:00.596
Aren't you forgetting something?

29:00.711 --> 29:02.129
I am not going to let a few miles

29:02.174 --> 29:03.770
of Canadian border stop me.

29:03.962 --> 29:05.787
That's not what I meant.

29:08.024 --> 29:09.734
The Frog is expecting to meet Harrow.

29:09.792 --> 29:12.476
And Charles Harrow is dead.

29:22.714 --> 29:25.744
Aeroport de Sherbrooke,
southeastern Quebec.

29:25.774 --> 29:27.673
It's 30 miles across the border

29:27.728 --> 29:28.875
from New Hampshire.

29:28.899 --> 29:30.951
That puts La Grenouille
right in our backyard.

29:32.090 --> 29:35.165
Did I miss Quebec
becoming the 51st state?

29:35.213 --> 29:38.886
I'm not going to watch that
bastard fly away again, Jethro.

29:38.933 --> 29:39.953
I can.

29:40.001 --> 29:41.134
Why don't we snatch him when he lands,

29:41.158 --> 29:44.126
toss him in the back of the
trunk and drive over the border?

29:44.150 --> 29:46.551
That might work where you
grew up, Ziva, not here.

29:46.614 --> 29:48.028
Why not.

29:49.262 --> 29:51.003
Okay, I'm down with the border snatch.

29:51.027 --> 29:52.103
What do we charge him with?

29:52.127 --> 29:53.415
Bidding on a Greek villa?

29:53.450 --> 29:56.186
Tony's right, we've got
nothing on Grenouille.

29:56.234 --> 29:58.655
And since Harrow's
dead, that can't happen.

29:59.467 --> 30:00.817
Does the Frog know that Harrow's dead?

30:00.841 --> 30:01.841
Probably not.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.253
And if he never met him...

30:03.277 --> 30:06.736
All we need is a
68-year-old Englishman.

30:09.217 --> 30:12.745
Is it pronounced Harrow or Hairrow?

30:12.792 --> 30:14.888
Harrow, Ducky.

30:14.946 --> 30:16.647
Charles Andrew Harrow.

30:16.844 --> 30:17.947
Okay, Ducky, now pay attention.

30:17.971 --> 30:19.756
- ARES...
- Are you certain?

30:19.803 --> 30:23.196
'Cause I was in medical
school with an Ian Hairrow.

30:23.220 --> 30:25.196
He spelled it the same way.

30:25.220 --> 30:28.039
Ducky, please pay attention,
I-I'm trying to give

30:28.097 --> 30:30.381
of the Navy's most
complex weapons systems.

30:30.405 --> 30:30.969
Sorry.

30:31.027 --> 30:32.610
You look dashing, Ducky.

30:32.645 --> 30:35.183
Yes, I used to wear a
moustache in Singapore

30:35.207 --> 30:36.371
when I was attached to...

30:36.395 --> 30:39.153
ARES is an encryption decryption system.

30:39.211 --> 30:42.047
Means it is used to encode
and decode information.

30:42.117 --> 30:45.431
In this case, GPS targeting information
for the Navy's cruise missiles.

30:45.455 --> 30:49.005
It operates by using the
algorithm known as IDEA.

30:49.331 --> 30:51.974
It's the same algorithm used for all.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.560
RSA Legacy keys

30:53.584 --> 30:55.522
generated by PGP.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.498
It uses a variable-length key,

30:57.522 --> 31:00.739
from 32 bits to 448 bits.

31:00.809 --> 31:02.458
Questions so far?

31:02.582 --> 31:04.527
You sure it's not Hairrow?

31:07.082 --> 31:08.996
It's a ten-hour drive
to the Canadian border.

31:09.020 --> 31:10.308
We're going to have to go
without a surveillan van.

31:10.332 --> 31:11.862
I've got it covered.

31:11.897 --> 31:13.842
She's got it covered? How?

31:14.271 --> 31:15.609
Let's just say it's a favor

31:15.668 --> 31:18.802
you and I couldn't have called in.

31:22.022 --> 31:23.625
I know it doesn't look like much,

31:23.649 --> 31:27.440
but inside is 20 million
bucks worth of ARES.

31:28.272 --> 31:29.214
Guard it with your life.

31:29.238 --> 31:30.238
Of course.

31:33.486 --> 31:34.837
I find a little levity

31:34.861 --> 31:37.461
at the start of a mission relaxing.

31:38.238 --> 31:39.592
Boss, we got a problem.

31:39.638 --> 31:41.024
Just one, McGee?

31:41.048 --> 31:43.898
Grenouille is sure to have
someone there to vet ARES.

31:43.922 --> 31:45.648
You know, if someone asks Ducky

31:45.672 --> 31:47.152
to explain something,

31:47.922 --> 31:49.274
his duck is cooked,

31:49.298 --> 31:50.478
no pun intended.

31:50.799 --> 31:52.078
Well...

31:52.987 --> 31:55.715
that's why you're going to
be there with him, McGee.

31:55.739 --> 31:58.948
Okay, just rember, Ducky.

31:58.983 --> 32:00.032
Charles.

32:00.363 --> 32:01.363
What?

32:01.401 --> 32:03.442
My name is Charles Harrow.

32:07.865 --> 32:08.865
Charles...

32:10.113 --> 32:11.717
we've got a plane to catch.

32:11.741 --> 32:13.511
Yes, and an arms dealer.

32:14.990 --> 32:17.954
Uh, mind if I have the window seat?

32:22.616 --> 32:23.592
Gulf stream Five.

32:23.616 --> 32:26.213
Registration: 2-1-8 Echo.

32:26.365 --> 32:27.785
Copy you, Archangel.

32:28.492 --> 32:30.968
They flew into Washington
on a different G-5

32:30.992 --> 32:33.139
- when I tagged the luggage.
- Tagged their luggage?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.706
Oh... that's when Jenny had you, uh...

32:35.763 --> 32:37.103
under covers.

32:37.430 --> 32:39.445
Undercover, not under covers.

32:40.240 --> 32:44.020
218 Echo is a Sorbonne Air
Charter out of Orly Sud.

32:44.116 --> 32:46.219
It's been refueled
and flight plan filed.

32:46.243 --> 32:48.579
T. O. D.: 24:00.

32:48.783 --> 32:50.569
35 minutes.

32:52.369 --> 32:54.484
This is your Op, Director.

32:56.803 --> 32:58.163
Bring Ducky online.

33:00.870 --> 33:02.230
Sound check, Ducky.

33:04.061 --> 33:06.288
Now I know why they call
these wretched things

33:06.340 --> 33:07.735
earwigs.

33:07.815 --> 33:10.281
Make the exchange, Doctor, and get out.

33:10.305 --> 33:12.846
I don't want you caught in
the middle of a firefight.

33:12.870 --> 33:15.597
That's very considerate
of you, Director.

33:15.621 --> 33:16.621
And Ducky...

33:17.620 --> 33:18.620
thank you.

33:20.055 --> 33:21.290
It's a pleasure.

33:24.805 --> 33:26.382
Tally-ho.

33:28.079 --> 33:32.073
Six months of undercover work,
and it all comes down to Ducky.

33:40.459 --> 33:41.874
Can I help you?

33:42.272 --> 33:43.337
Charles Harrow.

33:43.773 --> 33:45.810
Monsieur La Grenouille is wating for me.

33:45.834 --> 33:47.374
One moment, Monsieur Harrow.

33:48.963 --> 33:50.438
Well, that was easy.

33:51.025 --> 33:52.750
When this is over, you really should

33:52.774 --> 33:55.024
talk to somebody about security.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.700
I'll take that under advisement.

33:58.774 --> 34:01.625
I mean, a terrorist
could hire a car and...

34:01.649 --> 34:03.532
Wait a minute. Who's this?

34:04.911 --> 34:07.392
Identification, please.

34:07.434 --> 34:09.934
Martin Quinn. He flew
in with La Grenouille's

34:09.958 --> 34:12.150
advance party two months ago.

34:14.902 --> 34:16.617
Open the trunk, please.

34:19.275 --> 34:20.975
And you wanted to hide in the boot.

34:21.027 --> 34:23.815
You didn't take me seriously, did you?

34:26.337 --> 34:27.594
With me.

34:39.027 --> 34:40.917
All right, hold it there.

34:53.402 --> 34:54.467
Charles Harrow?

34:54.965 --> 34:58.445
You say that as if you're
surprised to see me.

35:01.090 --> 35:03.316
Archangel, Ducky might
have been compromised.

35:03.340 --> 35:05.175
Archangel has him covered.

35:06.966 --> 35:08.026
You have ARES?

35:08.780 --> 35:10.506
You have the 20 million?

35:10.845 --> 35:12.936
He's nature.

35:12.971 --> 35:14.069
Maybe, but he's making me nervous.

35:14.093 --> 35:15.093
Regine.

35:18.091 --> 35:19.091
Hello.

35:23.637 --> 35:26.228
Tell him to hand over
the damn laptop, McGee.

35:26.299 --> 35:27.881
Ducky, give her the laptop.

35:27.905 --> 35:29.198
May I?

35:32.495 --> 35:34.549
This is ARES?

35:34.783 --> 35:38.093
Never judge a computer
by its shell, my dear.

35:39.718 --> 35:40.916
Password?

35:40.958 --> 35:42.189
Raven.

35:43.034 --> 35:43.942
Satellite uplink?

35:43.994 --> 35:45.364
Built into the circuit board.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.283
It's built into the circuit board.

35:47.344 --> 35:49.036
Follow the on-screen instructions

35:49.082 --> 35:51.539
- to lock onto a satellite.
- Just follow the on-screen

35:51.609 --> 35:54.436
instructions, uh, to
lock into a satellite.

35:54.494 --> 35:55.494
Good.

35:56.701 --> 35:58.048
Where's Grenouille?

35:58.072 --> 35:59.737
Aren't you going to invite me

35:59.761 --> 36:02.661
in out of the cold, Monsieur Grenouille?

36:03.261 --> 36:05.141
I would, but I'm not him.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.104
Finally.

36:22.637 --> 36:24.937
I trust you'll forgive a rather

36:25.012 --> 36:27.161
operatic entrance, Mr. Harrow,

36:27.211 --> 36:29.899
but I love theatre.

36:29.963 --> 36:31.827
Me too.

36:31.912 --> 36:35.314
Hmm. Which is your preferred opera?

36:35.349 --> 36:37.365
My opera preferred.

36:37.389 --> 36:39.652
Cosi fan tutte... undoubtedly.

36:40.325 --> 36:42.441
- I understand.
- And you?

36:42.702 --> 36:45.681
Ah..."La Force du Destin", no?

36:45.751 --> 36:47.744
So deep.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.126
Why do they have to speak French?

36:50.325 --> 36:52.865
'Cause we're here in Quebec, boss.

36:53.389 --> 36:54.989
Ducky, English, please.

36:55.267 --> 36:56.327
Yes, well, uh,

36:56.765 --> 36:59.732
shall we step out of the wind?

37:00.327 --> 37:01.327
Of course.

37:02.953 --> 37:04.548
Perhaps your car?

37:05.391 --> 37:07.765
Too much time with even
the most beautiful woman

37:07.841 --> 37:09.452
can be boring.

37:10.077 --> 37:12.977
I wouldn't know, Mr Grenouille.

37:13.077 --> 37:14.902
Ah, my name's warrior is

37:16.016 --> 37:17.671
for rivals and enemies.

37:18.266 --> 37:20.926
I choose to believe you are neither.

37:21.330 --> 37:22.390
Call me Renee.

37:23.078 --> 37:24.152
Ducky.

37:24.454 --> 37:25.454
Ducky?

37:26.517 --> 37:28.592
What an interesting nickname.

37:28.829 --> 37:31.309
Yes, it's a... an unfortunate one

37:31.393 --> 37:32.741
I picked up

37:32.799 --> 37:35.119
as a lad, uh, during the Blitz.

37:35.143 --> 37:37.351
- Please.
- Ah, thank you.

37:41.644 --> 37:44.511
Just run the damn photo.

37:45.580 --> 37:46.931
Where are you going?

37:46.955 --> 37:49.380
Our man wants his private cognac.

37:49.644 --> 37:50.932
You see anything out there?

37:50.956 --> 37:51.956
You kidding?

37:52.143 --> 37:54.383
Canadians are in bed by 9:00.

38:00.395 --> 38:04.890
Have you ever enjoyed a glass
of, uh, "L'Esprit de Courvoisier"?

38:05.273 --> 38:07.308
The Spirit of Courvoisier? No.

38:07.332 --> 38:08.857
I can't say I have.

38:11.270 --> 38:12.275
Monsieur?

38:12.522 --> 38:13.527
- Here.
- Thank you.

38:17.271 --> 38:19.528
It will be a beautiful way
to consummate the transfer

38:19.578 --> 38:21.497
of the villa, no?

38:21.521 --> 38:24.301
Le Froggie is more careful than Gotti.

38:26.023 --> 38:28.498
It's why he's never been caught.

38:33.459 --> 38:35.469
Do you have children, Ducky?

38:35.648 --> 38:37.685
Sadly, no.

38:38.586 --> 38:40.591
One of life's great gifts.

38:41.398 --> 38:43.048
I have three.

38:44.898 --> 38:47.730
And two grandchildren, a girl and a boy.

38:47.811 --> 38:50.531
Everything I do now is for them.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.144
I am provider and protector

38:54.797 --> 38:56.857
in equal part.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.215
Napoleon?

39:00.400 --> 39:03.002
Napoleon was the first
to drink this cognac

39:03.026 --> 39:04.266
at his coronation

39:05.401 --> 39:07.425
in 1802.

39:08.900 --> 39:13.449
And since then, only
the very best of vintage

39:15.152 --> 39:16.922
has been added to that.

39:18.527 --> 39:20.849
200 years of empires,

39:22.056 --> 39:23.683
revolutions,

39:24.838 --> 39:26.445
and war?

39:27.713 --> 39:29.377
Mm, history in a glass.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.056
"Histoire dans un verre".

39:32.778 --> 39:33.778
Salut.

39:41.153 --> 39:42.153
Kort?

39:42.589 --> 39:43.714
Something wrong?

39:44.027 --> 39:45.240
No.

39:45.589 --> 39:47.959
Is it worth20 million in diamonds?

39:48.465 --> 39:49.465
More.

39:49.654 --> 39:52.134
The Iranian will give 100 for it.

39:53.340 --> 39:56.415
Tell the pilots wheels
up in five minutes.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.741
They're starting engines.

40:03.095 --> 40:04.203
Surprising?

40:04.529 --> 40:06.543
It's astonishing.

40:09.099 --> 40:11.030
Regine approves.

40:12.032 --> 40:14.393
Excellent.

40:15.591 --> 40:17.284
Well, it's been a pleasure, Ducky.

40:17.344 --> 40:19.512
Yes, for me, too.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.344
Get the diamonds.

40:26.396 --> 40:27.849
Renee...

40:29.407 --> 40:31.717
aren't you forgetting something?

40:31.967 --> 40:35.014
No. My bottle of history
is yours, my friend.

40:35.658 --> 40:37.128
You add to it well.

40:38.157 --> 40:40.097
I don't know what to say.

40:40.407 --> 40:41.942
Give me the diamonds!

40:42.033 --> 40:43.508
Oh, yes, well, uh...

40:44.096 --> 40:46.048
I - I hate to be crass,

40:46.097 --> 40:47.749
but the... the diamonds?

40:48.594 --> 40:51.367
Yeah. Kort has them.

40:52.088 --> 40:53.159
Oh, very well.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.824
Archangel awaiting instructions.

40:54.894 --> 40:57.538
This was to be a snatch, wasn't it?

40:58.534 --> 41:00.764
Or did you have something else in mind?

41:01.973 --> 41:03.388
Au revoir, mon ami.

41:03.785 --> 41:04.785
Au revoir.

41:04.844 --> 41:05.899
A bientôt.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.265
Director SheShepardard.

41:10.410 --> 41:11.821
About to lose target.

41:11.845 --> 41:14.228
Target will be lost in five seconds.

41:14.971 --> 41:17.106
Archangel requesting instructions.

41:20.472 --> 41:21.965
Director?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.343
Stand down, Archangel. Stand down!

41:35.972 --> 41:37.857
Tell me you got the call.

41:38.161 --> 41:39.161
What call?

41:43.599 --> 41:45.895
Yes, I got the damn call.

41:47.663 --> 41:50.732
Your diamonds, Dr. Mallard.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.265
He knew my name!

42:14.289 --> 42:15.506
He's CIA.

42:15.727 --> 42:18.027
- So was Harrow.
- It was a sting.

42:18.726 --> 42:19.726
We got stung.

42:20.290 --> 42:23.058
No. We got screwed.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.789
One question.

42:26.351 --> 42:28.462
What do I do with these?

42:31.352 --> 42:33.182
Oh, how many you keeping?

42:34.416 --> 42:36.453
Did Ducky fix Harrow's time of death?

42:36.477 --> 42:37.366
Yeah.

42:37.414 --> 42:40.686
On the record, he will drop
dead of a heart attack tomorrow.

42:41.290 --> 42:42.704
Good.

42:42.728 --> 42:46.092
I wouldn't want Grenouille to
discover he'd met a dead man.

42:46.417 --> 42:51.874
Harrow altered the ARES unit,
installed a Trojan horse.

42:51.978 --> 42:54.633
If the Iranians even try to use it,

42:55.103 --> 42:58.330
they'll be targeting
their own defense systems.

42:58.354 --> 43:00.309
Quite a strategic advantage.

43:02.483 --> 43:04.543
I didn't need to know that.

43:04.729 --> 43:05.977
Neither did I,

43:06.029 --> 43:08.285
but somebody thought
they could trust me.

43:12.855 --> 43:15.990
I will get him, another
time, another deal.

43:16.544 --> 43:19.314
I will be there, and I will get him.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.425
Are you sure you want to?

43:25.296 --> 43:26.791
Of course I want to!

43:26.826 --> 43:30.448
Some people need have someone to hate.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.008
Not me.

43:32.313 --> 43:34.927
Then you should have
let Ziva take the shot.
