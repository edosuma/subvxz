00:01.700 --> 00:05.333
Guys, we're going on a cruise and
you guys are coming with us.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.272
And none of you have a choice.

00:07.274 --> 00:08.841
A cruise? If I wanted to watch

00:08.843 --> 00:11.310
a heavy-set guy in sandals eating with
his hands, I would've just posted up

00:11.312 --> 00:12.644
and watched Nick in the kitchen.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.847
When we were together,
we booked a cruise.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.649
We tried to get our
money back, but it's...

00:17.651 --> 00:18.884
Nonrefundable.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.185
Yeah.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.987
They made that very clear.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.288
Seemed like a safe bet at the time.

00:23.290 --> 00:28.394
I don't want a refund on my cruises
and I don't want a refund on you.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.795
We're never gonna die!

00:29.797 --> 00:31.897
- Yeah!
- Y'all nasty.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.133
Ah-ha-ha, yeah!

00:34.135 --> 00:35.367
Where you going?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.202
- Yes!
- What are you doing now?

00:37.204 --> 00:38.504
Oh, there she goes...

00:38.506 --> 00:40.706
Turns out, I do want a refund...

00:40.708 --> 00:42.007
On you.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.642
Give me my money back!

00:43.644 --> 00:47.646
Anyway, they let us
downgrade our "lovers' suite"

00:47.648 --> 00:48.847
to include four more people.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.315
And that's you guys.

00:50.317 --> 00:53.652
I have some concerns about going on a
cruise with two people that just broke up.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.653
- Absolutely. - Me, too.
- Yeah, I have the same concern as Winnie.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.854
Like, I don't want to go.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.356
I have strong qualms as well.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.257
He got qualms.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.491
Put those qualms away.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.026
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine, okay?

01:01.028 --> 01:02.594
- Totally.
- We are killing this breakup, honestly.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.697
But we're gonna be on a ship in the
middle of the ocean with no escape.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.567
What if you guys get in a big fight
and we're stuck out there with you?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.602
It'll be like a floating,
all-you-can-eat prison.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.705
I promise you no weirdness.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.175
Guess that's an excuse to go
out and buy a new bikini.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.943
- Which could be good.
- I'm in.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.878
Full steam ahead! We have two on board!

01:19.880 --> 01:21.780
Nope!

01:21.782 --> 01:24.249
Let's not do, uh, nautical puns, please.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.684
If we're gonna do nautical
puns, we shouldn't...

01:25.686 --> 01:26.885
We shouldn't go.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.253
That's fair, and I won't.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.855
I'm in, too.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.190
Uh, I have an idea. Just
throwing this out there.

01:31.192 --> 01:35.227
What if we do the cruise on the ground?

01:35.229 --> 01:36.962
- Like, on land.
- That's silly.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.530
What, are you scared of boats or something?

01:38.532 --> 01:40.593
Afraid... me, afraid of boats?
You're afraid of boats, dude.

01:40.624 --> 01:41.533
Ha! He's scared of boats?

01:41.535 --> 01:42.768
Hold on, hold on.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.570
Oh, my God, you're scared of boats.

01:44.572 --> 01:45.971
Dude! Is it the boats or
the water? Can you swim?

01:45.973 --> 01:47.539
Yeah. You feel safe now?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.707
I'm not... I don't need to be safe, man.

01:48.709 --> 01:49.908
I'm brave!

01:49.910 --> 01:51.143
I take dumps standing up!

01:51.145 --> 01:52.978
I'm a man!

Schmidt, do you got any Fisherman's
pants I can borrow...?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.494
What's that?

02:08.496 --> 02:10.963
It's a class ring for Cece.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.765
She got her ged and I've
been tutoring her, so...

02:13.767 --> 02:16.568
I had this made.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.016
What?

02:18.047 --> 02:20.739
Shame, shame, I know your name...

02:20.741 --> 02:23.575
Please don't "shame, shame" me, Winston.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.511
You're still in love with her.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.112
I am not still in love with her, okay?

02:27.114 --> 02:31.850
You're alone on a boat with Cece, romantic
cruise, and you give her jewelry.

02:31.852 --> 02:32.285
Then what?

02:32.316 --> 02:34.019
I tell her that I'm still in love with her

02:34.021 --> 02:36.355
and that I want her back, and then
we have sex until the boat sinks.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.689
I knew it, I knew it!

02:37.691 --> 02:38.690
To the bottom of the ocean.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.958
To the bottom of the ocean.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.627
Oh, man... the sand and the mackerel

02:41.629 --> 02:42.661
and the chum and whatever
the hell else is down there.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.829
- And crabs.
- Not the crabs.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.531
- Yeah.
- Don't tell anyone.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.901
I'm serious, Winston. Do not tell anyone.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.069
What are you doing?

02:54.474 --> 02:56.008
You are so weird.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.944
Can you ever just leave the
room like a normal person?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.612
Cruise!
Cruise! Cruise! Cruise!

03:00.614 --> 03:03.215
Cruise! Cruise! Yeah!

03:04.717 --> 03:07.019
A little tight.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.687
With the amount of stuff
we're gonna be doing,

03:08.689 --> 03:10.189
we're barely gonna be in the room.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.523
Cruise! Cruise!

03:11.525 --> 03:14.293
Cruise! Cruise. Cruise...

03:14.295 --> 03:19.198
Welcome aboard the Wave Dancer,
your home for the next five days.

03:19.200 --> 03:25.170
I am your captain, Jan Nortis, and I
invite you to dance on the waves with me.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.739
Cruise! Cruise!

03:27.741 --> 03:29.408
Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cru...

03:29.410 --> 03:31.043
I'm gonna get drunk!

03:31.045 --> 03:32.244
Sorry.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.846
Enthusiasm! I like these people.

03:34.848 --> 03:38.417
Friendship is the most crucial
ingredient to any sea adventure.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.253
Second only to buoyancy.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.556
Because a ship has to float.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.024
Ah! Oh, okay.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.994
I didn't know where you was going with it.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.162
We love you, captain! Whoo-hoo!

03:50.164 --> 03:51.530
Everybody, my name is Doug.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.598
Hi, Doug. Hi, Doug.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.266
Hey, Doug. I'm Winston.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.268
Does anyone know what to
do in case of an emergency?

03:56.903 --> 03:58.370
Uh-oh.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.439
It looks like we're all in the same boat.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.840
Excuse me.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.177
If we could just continue on without any
more nautical puns, that'd be great.

04:05.179 --> 04:06.845
Feels like that's just
the lowest form of humor.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.181
Looks like I found a grumpy Gus!

04:09.183 --> 04:10.582
- I'm sorry, a what?
- Boo!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.584
- Boo...
- Boo and hiss! Boo.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.520
Folks, if you see Gus frowning around,

04:15.522 --> 04:17.389
brighten up his day by giving him a tickle.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.790
- A what?
- Tickle.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.291
- Quit it! Enough!
- Tickle. Tickles...

04:20.293 --> 04:21.760
I don't like to be tickled, you guys.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.961
- Tickle, tickle...
- All right! Enough!

04:22.963 --> 04:24.930
We have fun!

04:24.932 --> 04:26.265
But the ocean does not.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.466
What?

04:27.468 --> 04:30.035
Listen to what I have to say
if you don't want to die.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.703
Don't worry, Coach.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.071
Everyone who works on a
cruise ship is a performer.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.439
- They're just doing a show.
- So what?

04:34.441 --> 04:35.941
What are you talking to me about it for?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.542
- I'm not scared.
- I just thought you should know.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.144
- You're definitely scared. Sure.
- I'm not scared, dude.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.445
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, no, of course.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.880
- I'm not scared.
- You'll live. It's okay.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.915
Okay, now I need a volunteer to help
me with some emergency procedures.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.450
I'll do it. I don't care.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.585
'Cause I'm not scared.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.287
I'll volunteer my ass off.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.492
I ain't afraid of you!

04:54.827 --> 04:56.461
- Let's say it's 3:00 A.M.
- 3:00 A.M.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.630
- There's alarms going off...
- What?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.565
...freezing seawater up to your ankles.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.401
Adults are screaming, babies are crying!

05:02.403 --> 05:04.069
Go, go, go, go, go! You're up on deck!

05:04.071 --> 05:05.671
There's an Italian guy
strapping chains together!

05:05.673 --> 05:07.339
- You don't know what's going on!
- I know!

05:07.341 --> 05:09.274
- What do you do?
- I don't know! What do I do?

05:09.276 --> 05:10.809
- What do you do? What do you do?
- I-I get, I get in the boat?

05:10.811 --> 05:11.977
- You get in the boat!
- I get in the boat!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.011
You're getting in the boat!

05:13.013 --> 05:14.579
- I get in the boat!
- Wrong!

05:14.581 --> 05:15.914
Wrong! No! The first
thing you do is you what?

05:15.916 --> 05:18.850
Make sure your life preserver
is strapped on correctly.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.519
No, no, screw that, man!
I'm gettin' in the boat!

05:20.521 --> 05:22.120
Get out of my way!

05:22.122 --> 05:23.288
- I'm getting in the boat!
- Where you going, Coach?

05:23.290 --> 05:25.625
He's paddling to heaven,
'cause he's already dead.

05:25.656 --> 05:26.358
Don't say that!

05:26.360 --> 05:28.427
Spread your wings, little angel.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.462
- Douglas... that's a little too much.
- Oh, my God! Stroke! Stroke!

05:30.464 --> 05:32.297
- Ah, there's two of these!
- Okay... all righty.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.965
- How do you do two of these?
- Okay...

05:33.967 --> 05:36.668
- You're safe. You're okay.
- Stroke! Stroke!

05:36.670 --> 05:38.103
You're okay!

05:38.105 --> 05:39.338
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.013
Cut your fingernails, man! Ha ha!

06:22.015 --> 06:23.014
Nice! With this tickling.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.817
Hey, hey, hey, guys. The captain's coming.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.486
It's the captain.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.754
What's up, captain?

06:28.756 --> 06:29.921
Hello, again.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.358
I'm captain Jan Nortis,
as I previously stated.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.528
I would just like to say that I
am a fan of your enthusiasm.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.898
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Please don't do that.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.032
Sorry.

06:41.034 --> 06:45.337
I may be a captain, but first
and foremost, I am a woman.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.139
Absolutely.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.376
Come on!

06:51.378 --> 06:55.580
Did anyone just see that she was
flirting like crazy with Nick?

06:55.582 --> 06:58.450
That was, like, the most shameless
flirting I've ever seen.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.118
"Keep it in your pants"

07:00.120 --> 07:02.053
is all I have to say to captain Jan Nortis.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.388
- You're being really weird.
- You're being weird.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.756
- Super weird right now.
- Here we go.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.724
This is starting now already.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.892
I am not being weird.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.927
You're creating an awkward
situation for no reason.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.295
Don't do this, Jess.

07:10.297 --> 07:14.566
If this ship moves as fast as that
captain, we'll be in Ensenada by 6:00.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.635
Well, she was flirting with you.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.471
Which I'm okay with, because
she is a handsome woman.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.973
Jess, stop. You're being weird.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.408
No, I'm not being weird.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.277
I'm not being weird!

07:25.279 --> 07:27.145
I am, I am being weird.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.713
Okay, focus up for a second.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.917
Okay, they say this is an all-inclusive
trip, but you know what that means.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.652
But from their eyes, you
have a couple of drinks,

07:33.654 --> 07:35.787
and then you're done. And
then what have you paid for?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.088
We're smarter than that, okay?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.658
We are. We're gonna take every class,
we're gonna do every activity.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.492
We're gonna get our money's worth.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.127
- Okay. Got it?
- Yeah.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.762
Uh, Jessica Day and Nick Miller.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.097
All right, Day-Miller party.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.968
Here is your itinerary for
the grand romance package.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.770
No! No!

07:51.772 --> 07:55.106
Yeah, we're looking for
something more like PG-13.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.608
What do you have?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.643
Do you have, like, a
friendship package or...?

07:58.645 --> 08:01.413
What package would you recommend for
two brothers looking for trouble?

08:01.415 --> 08:03.348
The grand romance package is nonrefundable.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.750
Well, we're not doing that, so we're good.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.753
Are you sure? This includes
over $600 of activities and...

08:08.755 --> 08:10.789
- We're gonna do it.
- We're not doing it.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.157
$600?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.625
That is 600 one-dollar bills.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.460
That's the only way I can imagine it.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.429
- We can do this.
- Okay. Yeah.

08:17.431 --> 08:21.476
We're gonna get our money's worth. We are
the best ex-couple in the whole world.

08:21.507 --> 08:22.367
Yeah, we are.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.969
- Yes.
- Okay?

08:23.971 --> 08:25.437
You guys are exes?

08:25.439 --> 08:27.138
Yeah, you're not gonna want to do this.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.940
We're doing it. Give us the folder.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:40.520 --> 08:42.053
- I just wanted to say...
- Grumpy Gus!

08:42.054 --> 08:43.388
No! No! No!

08:43.390 --> 08:46.691
- Grumpy Gus.
- Sweet mother of sea dragon!

08:46.693 --> 08:48.293
What? What happened?

08:48.295 --> 08:54.666
I just witnessed a dolphin being
cut straight in half by our keel.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.134
It's a ghastly sight.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.369
What?

08:57.371 --> 08:59.070
That's horrible!

08:59.072 --> 09:00.305
Terrible.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.640
It's a shame about the dolphin, man.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.908
Really is.

09:02.910 --> 09:03.875
What?!

09:03.877 --> 09:08.046
As your bodies become
one, follow your breath

09:08.048 --> 09:13.151
through your spine to the soles of
your feet and into your genitals.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.686
What?

09:15.489 --> 09:17.088
Into my genitals?

09:17.090 --> 09:19.190
Yeah.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.725
Breathe into your genitals...

09:20.727 --> 09:22.360
I'm not breathing into my genitals, lady.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.862
All right, lovers, let's get sexy.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.897
Give me your sexiest pose right here.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.866
This is it. This is it. Sexiest pose.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.768
That's not... it's not romantic in any way.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.370
Think about the first time
you kissed. How was it?

09:32.372 --> 09:33.505
If you can move in.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.373
Come back in.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.542
Come back in.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.712
Wow, I've never done a
couples massage on exes before.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.014
In case you're wondering
what that scar on his back is,

09:43.016 --> 09:45.350
it's from falling on a
fence when he was six.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.586
I was legally dead for ten minutes.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.754
We're going to make all the towel animals

09:49.756 --> 09:52.023
you guys find in your
rooms every single night!

09:52.025 --> 09:54.092
- We made laundry.
- Nice.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.860
♪ We're always happy ♪

09:55.862 --> 09:59.698
♪ Life's for living, yeah,
that's our philosophy... ♪

09:59.700 --> 10:01.633
We're just totally different people.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.435
Yeah, we just don't belong together.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.739
You're really bumming me out.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.141
Hey, Jess, is this doing
weird stuff to your eyes?

10:10.143 --> 10:11.476
Definitely.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.745
Give me five, man! Leaving me hanging!

10:13.747 --> 10:16.715
You know what? You were right.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.249
This isn't weird at all.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.218
No, it isn't.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.653
Are they out of rosé?

10:21.655 --> 10:23.922
You know what?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.991
This is an old bartending trick, Jess.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.560
Put your glass out. You go like this...

10:28.562 --> 10:29.728
No way.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.129
Look at that. You got some rosé.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.230
You're a genius.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.331
I think I'm smarter at sea.

10:38.804 --> 10:42.474
You look, you look like you belong here.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.009
What's that, on a ship?

10:44.977 --> 10:46.845
Yeah, you, too.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.258
Oh, yo! Yo!

11:00.260 --> 11:03.828
Yo-yo-yo!
Yo, pal.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.363
Yo.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.165
Well, that was a mistake.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.433
Yes, it was!

11:08.435 --> 11:09.801
That was not on purpose.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.336
- My fault, too.
- Yep. Yeah, it was...

11:11.338 --> 11:13.204
We can't do the grand
romance package anymore.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.939
- I agree. We should...
- No. It's too much. It's too intense.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.808
- They whip you into this sexual frenzy.
- I know.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.843
- It's weird.
- I just feel like...

11:18.845 --> 11:20.512
Yeah, 'cause everything's fine. You
know, I feel like a cruise tonight.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.813
- It's not, like, a really big deal.
- I feel like...

11:21.815 --> 11:23.048
We're good. Everything's good.

11:23.050 --> 11:23.882
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

11:23.884 --> 11:24.616
- All right, bye, dude.
- Bye.

11:28.454 --> 11:31.289
Jess, I've been looking all over for you.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.625
I was hoping that as a
group, we could do a little

11:33.627 --> 11:37.896
night fishing... that I already put
a deposit down on, so we're going.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.731
And if we don't catch anything,

11:39.733 --> 11:42.467
they'll let us shoot a machine
gun directly into the water.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.335
That is international waters for you, baby.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.738
I would really love nothing more
than to go out there and shoot

11:46.740 --> 11:51.142
a bunch of fish in the face with you, but
I think that's more of a Nick thing.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.478
And yesterday, we decided it
would be better for everyone

11:53.480 --> 11:56.347
if we just spent the
rest of the time apart.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.549
What?

11:57.551 --> 12:01.086
I'm really sorry. I wanted this to
be a great vacation for you guys.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.420
But look, we split up the ship:

12:02.422 --> 12:04.522
I took starboard, he took the other one.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.492
I got the starboard and
she got the other side.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.760
What are you doing, man?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.495
You're hanging out by an exhaust vent.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.665
It keeps the left side of my face
warm and it sounds like the ocean.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.700
More than the ocean sounds like the ocean?

12:15.702 --> 12:18.336
Come on, Nick. You guys can't
be separate the whole trip.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.505
The trip just made it clear.
The breakup's too hard.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.440
I don't think we can
be friends for a while.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.777
What? You're not gonna
be friends with Jess?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.513
And even you guys said it.
It's just too weird.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.050
Nick, man, that's like the president and
the vice president not being best friends.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.518
They're not best friends.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.120
Come on. Everybody knows
they're best friends.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.221
They work together, but
they're not best friends.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.857
Dude, they're the president
and the vice president. Okay.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.425
I mean, is this something you're okay with?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.427
No, I'm not okay, but what am I gonna do?

12:42.429 --> 12:47.031
Well... I mean, look, man, we all
have to be together on this trip.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.600
That's why we came here.

12:48.602 --> 12:52.437
Nick, there's gotta be
something I can do.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.705
Yeah, you know what you can do?

12:53.707 --> 12:54.906
Yeah, anything, come on.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.475
You can cash in my skee ball tickets
on the other side of the boat.

12:57.477 --> 13:01.112
Get me one of those toy spiders that
I was talking to you about before.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.447
- And if they're out...
- All right, man, all right.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.883
...then grab me a bunch of erasers?

13:06.152 --> 13:11.122
The opportunity has not presented itself as
I'd hoped it would, so I'm creating it now.

13:11.124 --> 13:16.094
When I say, "May our progeny bathe in
the infinite glow," that's your cue.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.495
Now, what... what did I just say?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.731
You repeat it so I know
that you know the cue.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.267
May our pro... what?

13:22.269 --> 13:24.569
What's wrong with you? Unbelievable.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.471
I don't know what you're saying.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.106
I'll just say, "go," okay?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.275
When I say, "go," you start to play.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.977
And before she sees, just get
behind... get behind the vent.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.345
Get behind the vent.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.453
Cece...

13:42.455 --> 13:43.955
Hmm? Hey.

13:43.957 --> 13:47.025
Um, your hair in the moonlight...

13:47.027 --> 13:48.760
It looks so shiny. You know,

13:48.762 --> 13:53.298
I'm trying to get a signal so I can talk to
Buster, but it's just impossible out here.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.100
In the moonlight, your eyes, they
sparkle like, like fish eyes.

13:56.102 --> 14:00.772
I got one. Now, like, what, do I have to
hold it at this angle the whole time?

14:00.774 --> 14:03.708
Why is it so important for you
to get in touch with Buster?

14:03.710 --> 14:08.646
Look, you know better than anyone

14:08.648 --> 14:11.416
that I don't have the best
of luck with relationships.

14:14.286 --> 14:17.555
And I know you think he's young for me.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.891
I don't.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.063
I just want you to be happy.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.267
Thank you.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.136
Guys, guys!

14:32.138 --> 14:33.538
You got to come with me right now.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.906
Be warned, though.

14:34.908 --> 14:38.377
There is a weird guy with a
violin hiding behind this vent.

14:38.408 --> 14:39.244
A what?

14:39.246 --> 14:42.080
Dude!

14:42.082 --> 14:43.815
- What's going on?
- Come on... right.

14:48.254 --> 14:51.256
I will... I will knock you
out where you stand, sir.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.292
Get back there.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.363
They're gonna take a break
from being friends for a while?

14:58.365 --> 14:59.831
What does that even
mean? Guys, this is on us.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.734
We're the ones who put the
pressure on them to not be weird.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.402
I know. What were we thinking?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.337
Of course they're gonna be
weird. They just broke up.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.206
Hey, that's on y'all. I-I
have nothing to do with that.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.440
I've just been chilling in the room.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.775
Hanging out, singing songs.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.177
♪ You are safe in the room ♪

15:13.179 --> 15:16.047
♪ You are safe, you will live... ♪

15:16.049 --> 15:18.716
I've been trying to get them to talk
to each other all morning, okay?

15:19.786 --> 15:22.253
I passed up on breakfast
pizza and singles bingo.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.521
And those bingo chicks?

15:23.523 --> 15:25.590
Oh, they put out. Bingo!

15:25.592 --> 15:27.292
They're not gonna listen to us.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.860
Don't-don't ever do that again.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.295
The bingo thing? That's what they...

15:30.297 --> 15:31.763
It's funny, that's what they say when I...

15:31.765 --> 15:33.598
You know who they will listen to, though?

15:33.600 --> 15:34.799
- A doctor. The president!
- The ca...

15:34.801 --> 15:36.034
What were you...

15:36.036 --> 15:37.268
- What were you gonna say?
- The captain.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.636
The captain.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.606
Attention, this is your captain.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.976
Would Nick Miller and Jessica Day
please return to their stateroom

15:44.978 --> 15:50.081
for a non-life-threatening but
necessary official maritime reason.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.749
This is not an emergency.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.718
It is definitely not.

15:54.486 --> 15:55.586
Hey!

15:55.588 --> 15:56.721
Did you hear the captain? Yes!

15:56.723 --> 15:59.490
Go, go, go!

15:59.492 --> 16:01.426
Everybody inside! This is not a drill!

16:01.428 --> 16:03.227
Okay!

16:06.298 --> 16:07.966
Okay, the door is locked.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.168
The "Do not disturb"
sign has been employed.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.805
We are not leaving here until
you guys are friends again.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.274
We just wanted to spend our vacation alone.

16:16.276 --> 16:19.077
- Yes.
- On separate strange parts of this ship.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.279
Yeah, it's... I really wanted
to see how the ship worked.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.041
I think it's interesting.

16:22.072 --> 16:24.282
And I really wanted to see how the
other side of the ship worked.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.583
- Yeah.
- It's interesting.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.353
We should've never asked you guys
not to be weird around us. Mm-hmm.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.821
We-we want you to be weird around us.

16:29.823 --> 16:30.955
Yeah. Just let us in.

16:30.957 --> 16:34.592
Open your cellar doors, and
let us taste your jams.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.261
- You want to "taste our jams"?
- Again, you have lost me.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.097
Listen to yourself for once in your life.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.531
It's my jam and you can't have it.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.665
First of all, that's my
ex-girlfriend's jam, dude.

16:42.696 --> 16:43.501
I put a ban on jam.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.004
Okay, you know what? All of us are weird.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.605
But we're all still friends.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.873
So, let's talk about it.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.041
I'll go first.

16:50.043 --> 16:53.211
I've made out with half
of the guys in this room.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.013
- Okay. That's a start.
- All right.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.147
That's a start.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.782
And I have had nightmares

16:57.784 --> 17:00.618
about making out with the
other two guys in this room.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.153
- So, yourself?
- And me.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.122
- Nick and Winston.
- Okay. Okay.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.189
It's good for you to finally admit that.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.523
I respect that.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.492
Yeah, thanks for sharing.

17:07.493 --> 17:11.128
Um, it really bums me out that
I'll never know the infinite joy

17:11.131 --> 17:14.832
of what it feels like to
carry a child inside of me.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.534
- Wow.
- Okay, Coach!

17:16.536 --> 17:17.902
That's honesty.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.537
That's real honest. That's how it's done.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.039
Okay, um...

17:21.040 --> 17:22.073
Here we go, up we go.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.876
I feel like it is really weird that...

17:24.877 --> 17:27.744
I live with my ex-boyfriend.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.547
- See? There you go!
- Nice!

17:29.549 --> 17:31.416
Just turn on the tap. You
know, let it out. Really nice.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.252
That was cool that you admitted that.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.721
I feel weird about living
with my ex-girlfriend.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.023
Yeah. You know, I think
it's a landmine for trouble.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.892
What's gonna happen when
other hunks come around?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.327
What's gonna happen when you
bring some ho-bag in the house?

17:43.329 --> 17:45.163
Exactly! Like, that... it's
scary stuff, and I feel like

17:45.165 --> 17:46.898
when a breakup happens,
you mostly get away.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.033
'Cause I'm gonna beat her ass.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.902
What if she's bigger than you?

17:50.904 --> 17:52.770
She probably will be.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.605
Oh, snap! That was good.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.840
Good for you!

17:55.842 --> 17:57.341
Yeah! I saw that, man.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.043
That's how it all starts.
This is how it starts.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.678
Good. That's good, man,
that's really good. Yeah.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.946
Well, it's nice to talk to you about this.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.748
Yeah, it was really weird when you...

18:03.750 --> 18:05.116
Tried to kiss me last night,

18:05.118 --> 18:06.517
And you licked my ear.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.186
- What?! What?!
- You guys kissed last night?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.887
- This is so confusing!
- What?!

18:09.889 --> 18:11.289
It was just a lapse. We were drunk.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.523
You guys are getting back together?

18:12.525 --> 18:13.524
We're not getting back together.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.892
You're confusing everybody!

18:14.894 --> 18:16.127
No, it was the grand romance package.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.628
My God!

18:17.630 --> 18:19.397
They were, like, folding these towels.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.399
It was so sexy. You try folding towels

18:21.401 --> 18:23.067
like that and see if
you don't get turned on.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.103
Yeah, because they fold
the towels like vaginas.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.704
They're swans, dude.

18:26.706 --> 18:30.274
And the yoga instructor was, like,
breathing into our genitals, and, like...

18:30.276 --> 18:31.409
It opened everyone up.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.543
Yeah.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.978
In a real true way.

18:33.980 --> 18:34.979
Absolutely.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.081
This thing was ready to
talk to that thing again.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.783
- Emotionally and sexually.
- Yeah.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.718
- What?! What?!
- What's wrong with you, man?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.420
- Are you crazy?
- Just pick one... either

18:42.422 --> 18:44.055
You're together or you're not!

18:44.057 --> 18:45.623
Gonna punch you in the face, bro!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.125
Things are really weird.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.226
Agreed.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.662
But I'm okay with it.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.332
- Me, too.
- Hey, there.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.901
Aw! What? All right, okay.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.569
- Good enough, good start.
- Wonderful.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.271
Thank you for doing this
weird intervention thing.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.073
- This was pretty great.
- Yeah, it worked out.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.474
I think everybody's good now.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.842
Let's go eat our weight in fake crab.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.144
There you go. Absolutely. There we go.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.179
- Great idea.
- I'm gonna get drunk.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.981
I gotta get psyched up.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.516
Gotta get psyched up.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.451
The door's stuck. Is
that part of your thing?

19:13.453 --> 19:15.853
No. Well, call security.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.089
I got rid of the room phone. I-I thought
it was gonna be got rid of the phone?

19:18.091 --> 19:19.590
- More intense than this, I-I'm sorry!
- You murdered us!

19:19.592 --> 19:21.092
- Open up! Open up!
- What? No.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.293
- Watch out.
- You know what?

19:22.295 --> 19:23.928
It's just, it's usually the handle.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.596
- Just, like, get the handle...
- I'll do it, I'll do it!

19:25.598 --> 19:26.864
I got it. All right, move. I got it.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.132
Guys, guys, guys! Okay, here we go.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.667
Calm down.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.570
How long could it take
for someone to hear us?

19:37.276 --> 19:40.211
Oh.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.982
We did bad things to the tub.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.619
I got the sugars.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.022
I'm the sugar man.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.457
Silence! I have the talking soap!

19:53.459 --> 19:55.126
Oh!

19:55.128 --> 19:57.295
I'm the queen of Wednesday!

19:59.198 --> 20:01.832
It's so nice to have a family portrait.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.167
We should shower less.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.369
I think we look really great.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.171
I'm really glad we framed this.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.639
I mean, what a proud moment.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.841
It is cool being in the paper, though.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.977
Part of me died on that boat.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.846
Oh. I will
never be the same again.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.348
All right, man. Take a nap.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.482
Sleep it off, man.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.017
I'm sorry.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.018
Is Cece checking out Schmidt?

20:21.020 --> 20:22.753
What?!

20:22.755 --> 20:23.888
Let me see that.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.590
Huh?

20:26.859 --> 20:29.193
What are you talking about, Winston?

20:29.195 --> 20:32.930
Shame, shame, I know your name.

20:32.932 --> 20:36.434
You do not know my name, Winston.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.603
Cece got a boyfriend
who used to be Betty!

20:38.605 --> 20:41.005
Yeah, you better run, bitch.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.707
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:42.709 --> 20:44.575
That's my mustache!

20:46.613 --> 20:48.246
You know, I've been thinking a lot

20:48.248 --> 20:50.214
- about your sleeping arrangements and...
- Weird.

20:50.216 --> 20:55.019
I might have an idea on how to make
things a little bit less weird.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.454
Really? What is it?

20:56.456 --> 20:57.922
Two words.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.590
- Bunk beds.
- No.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.392
No, I'm not putting bunk
beds in my room, Schmidt.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.060
Not in your room. In my room.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.563
It'll be just like college, my man.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.198
Only with way more sex.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.933
- What?
- That came out wrong.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.302
I'm not bunking with you, Schmidt.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.939
Yeah, he is.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.140
Yeah, he is.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.276
Yeah, he is.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.077
There's gonna be a lot of rules,

21:20.079 --> 21:22.613
- and I'm gonna make most of them.
- You can make them all, man!

21:22.615 --> 21:24.548
Except for the ones that I make!

21:24.550 --> 21:27.351
First one in gets dibs!
