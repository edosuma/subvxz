00:03.086 --> 00:04.753
Good morning, everybody.

00:04.838 --> 00:08.257
Who would like an authentic
New York bagel, hmm?

00:08.341 --> 00:09.675
Stanley?
Thank you.

00:09.759 --> 00:13.262
Oh, no, no, no. l got
a pumpernickel just
for you.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.681
Wow, H&H.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.851
You went all the way
to New York City to
get us bagels?

00:18.935 --> 00:21.520
Why? ls there a place
closer that sells them?

00:21.604 --> 00:23.147
This is really nice, Dwight.
Thanks.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.231
Thanks.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.607
Oh, don't mention it.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.610
You owe me one.
You all owe me one.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.612
Good morning, Michael.
Morning, Dwight.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.697
Hungry?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.699
No, l had
a fish stick sandwich.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.451
Actually, l had two
fish stick sandwiches.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.286
My girlfriend
didn't want hers,

00:37.370 --> 00:39.872
because l guess l'm the
only aphrodisiac she needs.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.540
Fish sticks are
not an aphrodisiac.
Yeah.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.417
You're thinking of deer penis.
lt worked.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.836
Regardless, that was over
two hours ago,

00:45.920 --> 00:48.630
and it is now
a scientific fact
that you are hungry.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.090
Bagel?

00:50.175 --> 00:51.550
l don't mind if l do.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.302
Okay, l brought cheese, too.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.553
l'm taking one
for my lady friend.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.721
Excellent.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.431
Brain food.
Thank you very much.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.515
Okay.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.060
You owe me.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.437
Can't a guy just buy
some bagels for his friends,

01:03.521 --> 01:05.397
so they'll owe him
a favor which he can use

01:05.482 --> 01:10.277
to get someone fired
who stole a co-manager
position from him anymore?

01:10.361 --> 01:14.406
Jeez, when did everyone
get so cynical?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.514
Pam, would you
care for a bagel?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.598
Oh, no, thank you.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.935
Oh, that's right,
you're a woman and you need
to refuse food the first time.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.937
l'll try again.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.272
Please, Pam, reconsider
and have a bagel.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.191
l have an early lunch.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.236
PAM: MichaeI's
been trying to get
Jim and me to hang out

01:52.320 --> 01:54.321
ever since he started
dating my mom.

01:54.405 --> 01:57.241
l don't know.
l really hoped this
thing would just die out,

01:57.325 --> 02:00.410
but today he's planning
a birthday lunch for
my mom.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.162
And we have to go.

02:02.872 --> 02:07.209
No way out.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.170
These are amazing.
You took all these?

02:10.255 --> 02:13.340
l've always
found beauty in
uncommon places.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.717
Homeless people, graffiti.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.053
Photography lets
me capture all that.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.721
Have you ever been
photographed before?

02:19.806 --> 02:21.014
Oh, just by,
like, friends.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.226
Well, here's what l've
been doing around here.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.104
lt's for a series on
exposure in the workplace.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.273
Pammy?
Hey!

02:30.150 --> 02:31.733
Hey!

02:31.818 --> 02:33.318
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.988
Girls, there they are.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.406
Birthday lunch.
Birthday lunch.

02:37.490 --> 02:41.326
There's no
better medicine
than birthday lunch.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.912
lt'll cure all of your,

02:43.997 --> 02:46.915
"Gee, l don't know
if Michael should be
dating my mother."

02:47.000 --> 02:50.002
And fixes all
occurrences of,

02:50.086 --> 02:52.421
"l don't really
see them together."

02:52.505 --> 02:54.006
So, open wide, Pam,

02:54.090 --> 02:57.134
and take
a big old spoonful of
birthday lunch medicine.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.552
Take with food.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.432
Pam, aren't you
going to introduce us
to Michael's girlfriend?

03:03.516 --> 03:05.517
l think
you guys all remember
my mom from the wedding.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.352
Yeah, l think
everyone's met Helene.
Hi.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.437
MlCHAEL: Shall we?
Wait a minute,

03:08.521 --> 03:10.314
is that another
birthday present for me?

03:10.398 --> 03:12.608
'Cause you already
gave me a necklace.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.650
Oh, my God, l love it.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.736
Tell her how
you gave it to me.
No, that wouldn't be. . .

03:15.820 --> 03:19.198
He put it around my neck
while l was still asleep
this morning.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.532
Nice way to wake up.
MlCHAEL: Yeah.

03:20.617 --> 03:24.536
The rest of the story
has been censored
due to inappropriocity.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.371
Because of sex?
Kevin !

03:26.456 --> 03:28.790
Hey, please, Kevin.
You're fired.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.127
Sorry, sorry, work with
a bunch of idiots.
Shall we go?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.587
HELENE: Yes, let's go.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.631
Oh, wait.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.884
Swartz Lumber's on
the phone for you, Pam.
And they say it's urgent.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.261
Oh, you guys,
just one second.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.681
Oh, my gosh.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.975
Are you serious?

03:47.644 --> 03:48.769
Shipping emergency.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.103
l don't think
l can go to lunch.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.523
Oh, man, that's crazy.
Right as we were on
our way out, too.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.567
l know. lsn't that
always how it goes?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.903
Rarely, if ever.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.196
Let me
give it a whirl,
l'll talk to them.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.489
l will handle it.
That's okay.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.324
l feel like it's. . .
lt's my pleasure.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.576
Hello? Well, that's great.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.620
Turns out,
the paper was
there all along.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.205
Oh, thank God.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.501
Something's up. That paper
was never supposed to arrive.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.420
So, Pammy, are you
still liking sales?

04:15.505 --> 04:17.172
Yeah, it's exciting.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.052
You know, Michael
and l were talking,

04:22.136 --> 04:24.263
and maybe, if you
put in a little more

04:24.347 --> 04:28.100
face-to-face
time with your clients,
you could improve your sales.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.601
Pam's sales
are fine, actually.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.104
Just want you
to succeed, Pammy.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.564
You know what, we shouldn't
even be talking about
business today.

04:34.649 --> 04:35.607
Thank you.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.526
Today's about family.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.696
Why did
l get in the car?
l could've struggled.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.365
l have
a whistle in my purse,
l didn't even blow it.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.786
Oh, Dwight, l have
a little surprise
for you.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.789
Let me guess,
you ate the bagel
l gave you and loved it.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.040
Yes.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.876
And l wanted to
return the favor.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.170
l was polishing my loafers
and l happened to look over

04:57.255 --> 05:00.299
and notice
that your briefcase was
a little worse for the wear,

05:00.383 --> 05:02.050
so a little elbow grease,

05:02.135 --> 05:05.595
and she's
polished right up,
back to her former glory.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.098
Well.
Feel it against your cheek.

05:08.933 --> 05:09.975
l will.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.977
You give me a gift,
bam, thank you note.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.521
You invite me somewhere,
pow, RSVP.

05:15.231 --> 05:18.317
You do me a favor,
wham, favor returned.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.487
Do not test my politeness.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.239
Let me get that door
for you. There we go.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.991
Thank you very much,
and l got it for you.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.910
Oh ! Goodness. Thanks.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.163
You know, here's
a healthy fitness tip,

05:31.247 --> 05:32.956
if you clench your
buttocks together
while walking,

05:33.041 --> 05:34.708
you can really take the
pressure off your knees.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.418
ANDY: ls that right?
DWlGHT: Observe.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.920
(BOTH CHUCKLlNG)

05:39.005 --> 05:40.005
Right?
That really works.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.174
Yeah. Feel free to use that.
Anytime, okay.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.967
Hey, hold on a second.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.304
Do not walk around
with your jacket
catawampus.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.181
And that needs to be
straight as an arrow.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.475
Thank you very much.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.519
Oh, boy.
Hey, thank you
very much for that.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.356
You are welcome.
Have a seat. Allow me.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.358
Have a seat yourself.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.318
You know what?
l am going
to preemptively

06:01.402 --> 06:04.363
change the batteries
in your wireless mouse.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.530
Not necessary.
No, no, no!

06:05.615 --> 06:07.949
You didn't have to do that.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.701
Andy is complicating things.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.454
But l'm not worried.
This will only up my game.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.208
Hello. Scott.
Table for four.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.753
Welcome, Scott family.
lt'll be just a moment.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.881
l used
to love coming here.
The chicken parm is good.

06:22.965 --> 06:27.511
Big part of my childhood.
Maybe Michael will start
dating that, too.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.555
What table
should we take?
So many to choose from.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.308
Wow.
Oh, my God.

06:33.393 --> 06:38.772
What? All l see are
boring old tables with
no birthday decorations.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.484
Oh, wait a second,
you mean this one? Wow!

06:43.027 --> 06:44.486
Michael, you did all this?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.738
lt's not about taking credit.
Let's just say we all did it.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.824
Well, thank you,
all of you.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.119
Well, it was actually
me alone, so. . .

06:52.203 --> 06:53.578
Wow, look at this place.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.539
lt really
makes me want to
go to ltaly someday.

06:55.623 --> 06:58.500
Oh, you'll love it.
You can have my guidebooks.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.419

l'm done with those
really long plane rides.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.337
Thank you for. . .

07:02.422 --> 07:04.131
Thanks for
lending me the books.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.676
So, Mom, which birthday
are we celebrating this year?

07:07.760 --> 07:08.885
Sticking with 49.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.262
Forty-nine again?

07:10.346 --> 07:13.432
That's nine years in a row.
This is now our longest
family tradition.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.225
That's funny.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.102
Well, as long as
we're running numbers, Pam,

07:17.186 --> 07:18.395
help me out with this one.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.897
Let's see, honey,
you're six months pregnant,

07:20.982 --> 07:24.526
but you've only been married
for 30 days, so what does
that add up to?

07:24.610 --> 07:28.530
Ooh, burn, burn on you.
And a little bit on me, too.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.657
You're 54 years old.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.617
No, l'm 58.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.245
You're 58 years old?

07:35.329 --> 07:36.496
Uh-huh.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.665
Congratulations.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.293
The only time
you should care
about a woman's age

07:41.377 --> 07:42.919
is if she is
too young for you.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.047
And l am not
robbing the cradle.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.509
lf anything,
l am robbing the grave.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.471
Mom, have you decided
what you want to be called?

07:52.555 --> 07:56.433
l mean, l like Nana,
but l also like the
classic Grandma.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.602
Please be Grandma.
l want you to be Grandma.
Definitely a Grandma.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.188
(EXCLAlMS) Michael.
What do you think? Grandma?

08:01.898 --> 08:02.939
Uh-huh.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.483
Yay! Grandma.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.908
Hey, would you guys
ever do a triathlon,
you think?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.117
Maybe.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.285
Helene?

08:15.369 --> 08:16.912
No. l don't think so.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.247
l am.
l'm definitely
going to do it.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.666
l've already
got the run and
the bike thing down,

08:21.751 --> 08:24.669
just need to learn how
to swim. Come on, you in?

08:24.754 --> 08:28.465
No, no. l think a triathlon
is pretty much something
l can rule out.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.675
l don't know, it just
doesn't interest me.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.512
So, it's a matter of
interest. Good. Okay.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.556
lt's not anything you
would have ever done?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.016
l might have done it
when l was younger,

08:38.100 --> 08:40.101
but now
there are just other
things l'd rather be doing

08:40.186 --> 08:41.645
than running and jumping
and swimming. . .

08:41.729 --> 08:44.147
Well, there's no
jumping in a triathlon.
Oh !

08:44.232 --> 08:45.607
You're thinking
the broad jump.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.652
Would you try bungee jumping?
No.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.946
Snowboarding?
No, no, you want
to go snowboarding?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.697
l might, l might.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.616
Michael, what are
you talking about?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.159
(SlGHS)

08:56.244 --> 08:58.537
Nothing, just life

09:00.289 --> 09:05.085
and doing things
before you die.
l don't know.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.838
Do l really want to
go snowboarding? No.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.133
But l would like to
if l wanted to.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.026
You bought
breakfast for everyone,

09:30.111 --> 09:31.403
so l got
lunch for everyone.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.406
Okay, well, allow me.
You know what?

09:34.490 --> 09:37.242
Gosh, these tacos are
awfully complicated
to make.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.452
l will make
everyone's tacos!

09:39.537 --> 09:41.329
(EXCLAlMlNG)

09:41.831 --> 09:42.998
So we should
get the check.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.958
What about your gift, Michael?
Whoa, no, no, no.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.586
No, it's stupid.
You'd hate it, l hate it.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.212
l'm sure l won't.
Yes, you will.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.132
He locked
himself in his office
all morning working on it.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.175
Give me. Look at
this wrapping paper.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.678
lt's got the word "love"
on it in every language.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.932
l literally. . .
l put no thought
into the wrapping at all.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.393
Might as well
have been toilet paper.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.770
Toilet paper. Let's see.

10:05.855 --> 10:10.442
"A scrapbook of
our first memories,
by Michael Gary Scott,

10:10.526 --> 10:13.903
"for my girlfriend,
Helene, on your birthday."

10:13.988 --> 10:16.573
That's just an
arbitrary title.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.991
Okay, here's a penny.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.576
What's that from?
Penny for your thoughts.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.369
lt was from the
wishing well
at the mall.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.540
You threw it in,
l went back later,
waded in, and l found it.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.625
That's amazing.

10:26.709 --> 10:31.004
lt's not amazing at all.
lt's sort of weird that
l went and did that.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.257
And now your wish
won't come true,
so that blows.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.218
A poem.
Oh, that l plagiarized,
l think.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.222
"l cannot go to school today
said little Peggy Ann McKay"

10:41.891 --> 10:43.099

Yeah.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.684
"l have the measles
and the mumps

10:44.769 --> 10:47.020
"a gash, a rash,

10:48.773 --> 10:52.192
"Happy Birthday,
l love you, Helene."

10:52.276 --> 10:54.235
lt's really
nice, Michael.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.570
l think it sucks.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.239
l think
it's wonderful,
absolutely wonderful.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.325
Well, that's
because you and l
have very different tastes,

11:00.409 --> 11:02.285
and you like lame things.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.497
lt's a generational
sort of gap between us.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.166
Oh, God, a scrapbook.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.501
Home run, Michael.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.960
You set the bar so high.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.087
That was a bunt.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dwight,
l'm going to do this.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.218
Hey, hey, hey, relax.
l got it covered.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.511
No, l insist.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.513
No, no, no, no, no, l insist.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.016
Okay, Dwight,
this is ridiculous.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.310
Don't worry about it,
you can just owe me.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.021
Hey, where'd you go?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.523
Oh, l just went
to the bathroom.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.025
And then you stopped at
the bar on the way back?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.610
Got thirsty.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.029
Okay, weirdo.
Come on, it's time for cake.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.406
Okay.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.699
Honestly, for a long time,

11:40.783 --> 11:43.618
l thought l was going
to grow old with Holly.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.914
And then l met Helene,
and she is great,

11:47.998 --> 11:51.584
and she already knows
and has done everything

11:51.669 --> 11:56.464
that l have
ever wanted to do
and can tell me about it.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.970
But l think l want to
do those things myself.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.263
Cake's really good.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.266
l know.
l love when they use
butter-cream frosting.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.976
Finish your cake, Helene.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.229
l want you to
enjoy that cake

12:11.313 --> 12:13.732
because l have something
terrible l need to tell you.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.360
And l want you
to enjoy your cake

12:17.445 --> 12:20.572
before l tell you this
terrible, terrible thing.

12:23.534 --> 12:27.328
Helene, l think you're
a wonderful person and l. . .

12:27.413 --> 12:29.247
God, l've enjoyed
dating you

12:29.331 --> 12:31.124
and being your
boyfriend so much,

12:31.208 --> 12:36.963
but l have to
consider Pam's feelings
as a friend and a coworker.

12:37.047 --> 12:41.301
l cannot,
in good conscience,
continue to date you,

12:41.385 --> 12:43.428
when l know what
this is doing to her.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.431
Michael. Michael, it's okay.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.766
No, it's not.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.268
l know that it took me
a little while to
come around,

12:50.352 --> 12:53.354
and it's still
a little weird
to get used to,

12:54.690 --> 12:57.525
but you obviously
make my mom very happy.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.195
And that makes me happy.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.782
Wow, that just. . .
You've really grown.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.410
Well. . .
Oh, thank you, Pam.

13:07.495 --> 13:11.790
And l hope you are
as gracious during
this next part.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.544
Helene, once again,
you are a wonderful person,

13:16.629 --> 13:18.087
and you have
lived a great life,

13:18.172 --> 13:21.883
and l envy it,
and l want it someday,
but just in the future.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.345
You need somebody who
understands your references.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.554
Who is Kafka-esque?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.723
l've never. . .
l don't know him.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.770
There's another woman,
and her name is ltaly,

13:33.854 --> 13:36.147
and skydiving,
and bungee jumping.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.649
Okay, so. . .

13:37.733 --> 13:39.067
And l want kids.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.028
And you, unfortunately,
have already completed

13:42.112 --> 13:43.947
that part of your
journey down there.
Michael.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.032
lt's not my decision,
it's Mother Nature.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.910
And Mother has very
strict rules about

13:57.044 --> 13:58.503
fertility.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.755
(STUTTERS) l got it.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.759
l'm 58. What am l
supposed to do now?

14:05.886 --> 14:07.720
Well, hobbies.
Stop.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.181
(GROANS)

14:11.267 --> 14:13.476
What's going on?
Stupid thing wedged up there.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.727
No one in this
office will help me.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.229
Yeah, move it.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.773
What if Dwight dies
and l still owe him
something?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.775
That is a recipe
for a ghost.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.735
Oh, yeah,
you're gonna
owe me big time.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.153
Looks like a little
envelope, there you go.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.197
Yup. Got it.
"To Dwight"?

14:30.202 --> 14:31.327
Starbucks gift card.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.954
Surprise!

14:33.831 --> 14:36.791
lt's from everybody.
$1 5 value.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.546
Damn it!
l am no closer
to taking Jim down.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.673
(EXCLAlMS)
What a waste of a day.

14:43.757 --> 14:47.594
l could've
grown poison mushrooms
that'd be this high by now!

14:48.429 --> 14:50.680
They're mushrooms,
they don't get that high.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.725
Pamela Beesly-Halpert.
What?

14:53.809 --> 14:55.393
May l have
a word with you
in my office, please?

14:55.477 --> 14:56.436
l am working.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.522
Well, this is
a work-related matter.

14:59.607 --> 15:03.234
Really?
Yes.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.986
Join me, please,
won't you?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.909
l'm going to give you
a raise, Pam.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.076
Why?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.287
Because of
all the good
work you've done.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.331
l have
the lowest sales
record of anyone here.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.583
Don't, no.
lt's not about numbers Pam,

15:18.667 --> 15:19.959
it's about attitude.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.879
l have
the worst attitude
of any person here.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.506
Do you want
the raise or what?

15:25.591 --> 15:26.633
Yeah, l'll take it.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.760
Okay, hey. Pam, Pam.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.429
With this raise,
there are strings attached.

15:31.513 --> 15:37.268
And that string is attached
from my heart to your
mean attitude.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.603
You're bribing me?

15:38.687 --> 15:41.814
No, no. No, l am not.
Unless you want me to.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.024
Do you want me to?

15:43.108 --> 15:45.360
Because l will,
l will bribe you.

15:45.444 --> 15:51.866
No, your face is saying
don't, unless l haven't
offered you enough.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.703
Your face isn't changing.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.623
What is it?
Talk to me, face.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.583
Tell me what
Pam's brain is thinking.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.545
Come on,
what do you want?
What do you want?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.131
Do you want
a million dollars?
Do you want to hit me?

16:07.216 --> 16:08.800
Do you
want me to get down
on one knee and beg you?

16:08.884 --> 16:10.927
l want to hit you.
What?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.720
l want to hit you.
l'll do that.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.640
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.976
What? l don't. . .
Are you kidding?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.143
No, are you kidding?

16:19.228 --> 16:21.437
No, l don't. . .

16:21.522 --> 16:23.398
All right. Come on,
l'll take off my jacket

16:23.482 --> 16:25.900
and tense my stomach
and you just. . .

16:25.985 --> 16:29.737
No, l don't think
l can hit you in
the office.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.280
Okay.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.825
So, we'll do it after work.
Hmm.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.536
ln the parking lot,
in front of everyone.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.746
l'm going to hit you
as hard as l can.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.581
Okay.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.666
Okay.
Okay.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.710
See you then.
See you.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.253
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

16:47.589 --> 16:48.673
RYAN: Hey.
Hi.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.591
Quick question.
Yeah.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.052
Are you scared?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.512
Never.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.681
About what? A little.
What are you talking about?

16:56.765 --> 16:58.683
We heard about the punch.
What punch?

16:58.767 --> 17:01.644
Pam. She's going
to punch the crap out
of your face after work.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.688
l'm pretty sure we said slap.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.649
No, it's a punch and Pam
has that crazy pregnancy
strength now.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.736
l'm getting concerned
that you don't seem
to understand

17:09.820 --> 17:12.196
what's going to happen.
Do you?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.324
(EXCLAlMS) l'm good.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.409
RYAN:
All right.
See you there.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.537
Hey.
Hey.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.873
Do you and Pam
ever get frisky?
lnappropriate.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.751
l mean, do you ever
wrestle with each other?

17:24.835 --> 17:26.044
All the time.
Really?

17:26.128 --> 17:27.170
Yeah.
She's strong?

17:27.254 --> 17:28.254
She wants it bad, Michael.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.547
Can you stop this?

17:29.631 --> 17:31.549
l can.
Okay.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.551
And l don't support
her choice to hit you.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.761
l don't, either.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.180
But at the same time,
she goes crazy,

17:37.264 --> 17:39.682
and l do
understand her reasoning.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.893
Mmm-hmm. l know.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.895
l just need some time.
l need some time to
think about it.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.688
You got to do. . .
Give me some time
to make a decision.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.399
How much time do you need?
No more than a week,
maybe two weeks.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.484
Come on, man.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.944
Pam, can l talk
to you for a second?

17:52.029 --> 17:54.280
l heard
about the hit.
Just to be sure,

17:54.364 --> 17:55.948
it's off company
property, right?
Right.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.409
Yeah, okay, l think we
should probably be okay.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.952
Okay.
Okay.

18:00.454 --> 18:05.500
(WHlSPERS) And the power
comes from the back foot.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.462
So, it's all one motion
through the body.

18:10.089 --> 18:14.258
So, there's. . .
You stay a little
low and there's a twist,

18:14.343 --> 18:15.635
and you keep
your shoulder down.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.929
And you kind of
throw out the arm.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.013
(EXCLAlMS)

18:19.765 --> 18:23.351
Okay, wait,
you're saying it
comes from the foot?

18:23.435 --> 18:24.435
Yes.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.520
Okay.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.106
Yeah. Okay.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.233
Hey, everybody.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.902
He's not in the men's room,
although the seat was warm,

18:32.986 --> 18:34.403
so we may have
just missed him.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.738
My money's on Pam.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.574
lt's not a fight.
What other outcome
could there be?

18:38.659 --> 18:39.700
Michael could win.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.619
How? He can't hit back.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.705
Why can't you just
agree with me sometimes?

18:44.790 --> 18:47.125
Am l scared of getting
hit in the face? No.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.253
Every day, weirdos pay
dominatrixes hundreds
of dollars

18:50.337 --> 18:52.004
for that very privilege.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.800
l'm scared l'm going
to love it. Let's do this.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.720
lt's okay, guys.
l can handle this.
Everybody can go home.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.764
We're here for
the show, Michael.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.933
You're just
a bunch of voyeurs.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.101
Are you eating popcorn?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.477
lt has almost no calories.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.895
You ready?

19:09.064 --> 19:10.148
Yes.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.068
You have to
keep your hands down.
l know.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.029
(EXHALES)
Okay. All right.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.448
Oh, God !

19:19.533 --> 19:20.825
Michael, you have to
keep your hands down.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.160
Put your hands
in your pockets.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.578
Okay!

19:29.960 --> 19:31.252
Pam, Pam.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.173
l'm really sorry.
l'm sorry.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.091
What are you sorry for?
So many things.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.634
l don't know,
it's hard to choose.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.802
How about for dating my mom?

19:39.887 --> 19:40.928
Maybe that's it.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.346
And dumping her
on her birthday?

19:42.431 --> 19:43.639
Yes.

19:46.894 --> 19:53.274
Okay, just don't ever date
a member of my family again.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.694
Okay, l promise.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.615
For the record,
your mom came on to me.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.618
Holy crap!

20:06.121 --> 20:08.206
Are you okay?
No!

20:08.290 --> 20:09.707
You're okay.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.084
Feel better?

20:12.169 --> 20:13.586
No, you were right.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.673
Wait, why are you limping?

20:17.758 --> 20:19.050
l don't know.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.885
Let's get some
raw meat on that face.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.012
l've got a chicken
in the freezer upstairs.

20:23.096 --> 20:27.558
As l watched Pam's big,
strong hand coming
toward my face,

20:27.643 --> 20:30.728
l saw my entire life
flash before my eyes.

20:30.812 --> 20:33.272
And guess what?
l have four kids.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.194
And l have a hover car
and a hover house.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.155
And my wife is a runner,
and it shows.

20:42.199 --> 20:46.744
And Pam and Jim
are my best friends,
and our kids play together.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.997
And l'm happy.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.583
And l am rich
and l never die.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.214
lt doesn't
sound like much,
but it's enough for me.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.801
Good, good, just keep it
on there for another
five minutes.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.762
lt's cold, Dwight.
Let the swelling go down.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.349
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
l owe you one, Dwight.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.103
Fire Jim.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.646
No.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.439
l'm cashing in
the favor, fire him.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.607
What are you talking. . .
Do it.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.401
Promote me.
Tri-managers.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.527
Forget that.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.653
Can l have an office?
No.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.446
You know what, you can
keep your stupid favor.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.864
lt's worthless.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.201
And this is my dinner on
your face, l'm keeping it.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.870
Oh, that feels better.
