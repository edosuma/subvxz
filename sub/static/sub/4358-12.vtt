00:02.560 --> 00:04.920
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:04.920 --> 00:06.440
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.440 --> 00:10.640
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.680
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:16.680 --> 00:19.760
and I'm drenched 
 in some weird chemical.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.320
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:37.680 --> 00:40.840
My best friend Ray 
 thinks it's cool.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.000
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.480
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.640
Not even my parents.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.960
I know the Chemical Plant 
 wants to find me

00:53.960 --> 00:55.800
and turn me into some experiment.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.200
But you know something?

00:57.200 --> 01:00.480
I guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.520
# Alas my love #

01:03.520 --> 01:05.720
# You do me wrong #

01:05.720 --> 01:08.240
# To cast me off #

01:08.240 --> 01:10.320
# Discourteously #

01:10.320 --> 01:12.920
# And I have loved you #

01:12.920 --> 01:14.720
# For so long #

01:14.720 --> 01:19.320
# Delighting in your company #

01:19.320 --> 01:21.360
# Greensleeves #

01:21.360 --> 01:23.800
# Was all my joy #

01:23.800 --> 01:25.560
# Greensleeves #

01:25.560 --> 01:27.840
# Was my delight #

01:27.840 --> 01:29.520
# Greensleeves #

01:29.520 --> 01:32.000
# Was my heart of gold #

01:32.000 --> 01:36.760
# And who but my lady Greensleeves? #

01:36.760 --> 01:38.040
Alex?

01:39.960 --> 01:42.080
Alex?

01:42.480 --> 01:43.600
Yeah?

01:43.600 --> 01:47.200
Isn't today your audition 
 for the School Variety Show?

01:47.200 --> 01:50.400
- Mm-hmm. 
 - Are you nervous?

01:50.400 --> 01:53.400
- A little. 
 - You know, your mom used to sing.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.640
[both] 
 We know.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.520
She's often revisited 
 those memories on us.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.120
Oh, thank you.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.600
Alex, uh, you want 
 to give us a little taste

02:03.600 --> 02:06.400
of what you're preparing 
 for the audition?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.440
No.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.520
Am I sensing a little stage 
 fright happening here?

02:10.520 --> 02:12.080
Leav me alone, Annie.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.920
Alex, you have a beautiful voice.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.400
We'll see how beautiful 
 it is at 8:30 this morning.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.040
[playing slow, jazzy tune]

02:47.600 --> 02:49.800
- Alex, just relax. 
 - Nicole's right.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.440
I mean, if you're too tense

02:51.440 --> 02:55.200
you're going to get these horrible 
 nodes on your vocal chords.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.800
Have you guys decided 
 what you're doing in the show?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.680
I'm working behind the scenes.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.720
I believe anonymity is the best way

03:02.720 --> 03:05.120
to do the most good 
 for the most people.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.800
Nicole, please! I mean you're 
 stage-managing a Variety Show

03:08.800 --> 03:10.520
not saving the rain forest.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.120
What's so special 
 about what you're doing?

03:13.120 --> 03:16.720
- A stand-up routine? 
 - Comedy is serious business.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.200
I mean, great comedy 
 expresses pain and anger.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.360
Mmm, can't wait to hear those jokes.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.600
Hey, guys. 
 Sorry, I'm late.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.960
- Practicing for the audition? 
 - What audition?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.440
For the sax solo. 
 Did you forget?

03:32.440 --> 03:33.720
I guess I did.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.280
Ray, how will you beat 
 the competition

03:36.280 --> 03:38.160
if you don't psyche yourself up?

03:38.160 --> 03:40.200
I don't think I want to do this.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.200
Playing the sax should be fun, 
 not competition.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.400
Think like that.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.160
And they'll run you 
 out of the country.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.800
Got to run, my audition's 
 before first period.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.000
Wish me luck.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.760
- Break a leg. 
 - Good luck.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.600
Be careful.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.840
[nervously and off-key]: 
 # To cast me off #

04:01.840 --> 04:02.760
# Discourteously #

04:06.360 --> 04:08.000
[clears throat]

04:08.000 --> 04:10.760
[squeaking]: 
 # And I have loved you #

04:10.760 --> 04:12.760
# So long #

04:12.760 --> 04:14.720
# Delighting #

04:14.720 --> 04:18.000
# In your company #

04:18.000 --> 04:20.720
[squeaking]: 
 # Green... #

04:20.720 --> 04:22.480
Can I start over?

04:31.160 --> 04:33.880
Hey, Al, sorry about your audition.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.720
- Everyone's talking about it. 
 - Thanks for letting me know.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.120
Isn't your audition in 15 minutes?

04:40.120 --> 04:43.640
- I decided to blow it off. 
 - I can't believe you, Ray.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.280
You're really talented.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.720
When are you going 
 to take a chance?

04:47.720 --> 04:50.400
- But, Alex... 
 - I wanted to be in that show.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.560
I blew it, but I tried. 
 You won't even do that?

04:53.560 --> 04:57.880
- Can't you commit to anything? 
 - Man, you're cold.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.520
All right. I'll audition.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.080
- Don't do it for me. 
 - I won't.

05:03.080 --> 05:08.760
Of course, I'm holding you 
 personally responsible for my failure.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.720
After seeing you, I know 
 how painful that can be.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.040
Hey, Dad, check this out.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.280
I decided to audition for the sax 
 solo and I made it in the finals.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.000
What? That's great.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.520
- I mean, I still have to beat out... 
 - Ray, I'm so happy to hear this.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.400
Ray, when did you 
 take playing seriously?

05:31.400 --> 05:34.040
Dad, take it easy. 
 I'm only in the finals.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.200
This could all end in two days.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.920
I know it won't. 
 I have confidence in you.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.800
I always hoped you'd one day 
 decide on a career in music.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.720
Career? 
 Dad, let's not get carried away.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.520
Ray, I'm so proud of you, Ray.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.320
[Ray] 
 I knew this was a bad idea.

05:52.320 --> 05:56.760
I'm boxed in, Alex. 
 I'm suffocating, I can't breathe.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.120
Ray, calm down.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.720
My dad's talking about 
 picking me up an application

06:01.720 --> 06:03.560
for some music conservatory.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.280
In another week, 
 he'll probably have me

06:06.280 --> 06:10.600
headlining in some jazz festival. 
 At least you have a talent.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.960
What if I blow this audition? 
 It will destroy him.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.320
I could choke and humiliate 
 myself like you did.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.960
Can we forget about 
 my audition, please?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.800
Sorry. 
 Let's take a walk to the mall.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.400
I can distract myself

06:24.400 --> 06:27.640
by looking at things I want 
 and can't afford to buy.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.480
Ray, I got to finish 
 cleaning the garage.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.960
Come on, Alex 
 you can finish that in one minute.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.560
Guess maybe I have a talent, too.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.720
[phone rings]

07:09.720 --> 07:12.000
[Mrs Mack] 
 Alex, phone.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.920
Don't stay on long. 
 It's time for bed.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.840
Hello?

07:17.840 --> 07:19.680
Wait, wait, Ray, slow down.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.520
My father's making me nuts 
 over this audition.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.320
I'm blanking on my song.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.440
If I let him down, I don't know 
 what I'm going to do.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.960
I'll kill you-- you're the one 
 that got me into this mess.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.920
What can I do?

07:32.920 --> 07:36.600
You could come over right now 
 and help me learn this song.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.520
I'll see what I can do.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.120
I need your help.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.840
- How unusual. 
 - I have to get over to Ray's

07:44.840 --> 07:48.360
and there's no way Mom 
 will let me because it's so late.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.200
Can't you just see him tomorrow?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.840
Well, he needs help 
 with his audition

07:52.840 --> 07:55.400
and I feel kind of responsible.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.040
You could get there 
 through the pipes.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.440
We're all one big happy 
 plumbing family on this block.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.960
Are you sure there aren't 
 any gross thingies down there?

08:08.960 --> 08:12.000
You'll survive but 
 go change your clothes.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.640
[fluid gushing]

08:43.679 --> 08:47.440
The Michaels need to clean 
 the hair out of their drain.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.920
It took me a while to get through.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.280
Never mind that. 
 You're coming with me.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.400
I'm not kidding, Alex. 
 I won't be able to play.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.840
This is what I have 
 about competition.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.360
It ruins all the fun for me. 
 Check it out.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.560
[squeaking saxophone]

09:10.400 --> 09:12.720
Ray, you're going 
 to have a breakdown.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.360
Relax, you just need a little 
 more practice, that's all.

09:16.360 --> 09:20.680
Here, I'll read the notes aloud 
 and you follow along.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.080
It's hopless. 
 I'm a has-been at the age of 13.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.800
No, Ray, it's hopeless for me. 
 You've still got a chance.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.440
Come on, I took some 
 sax lessons a few years ago.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.000
[Alex singing notes, Ray plays]: 
 # A-G-E #

09:35.000 --> 09:36.800
# D-C #

09:36.800 --> 09:38.800
# D-E-G #

09:38.800 --> 09:41.600
# E-A-G #

09:41.600 --> 09:43.760
Again, again.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.760
I'll know this better than you.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.920
Maybe I should have played the sax

09:47.920 --> 09:50.040
instead of singing 
 that stupid song.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.360
[knocking on door]

09:59.360 --> 10:01.160
Come in.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.040
Ray, I was listening. 
 You sound great.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.640
If you need someone to practice 
 with just give me a yell.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.880
Okay.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.680
Well, I didn't mean 
 to interrupt, keep going.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.040
I got a feeling you're going 
 to blow those other kids

10:16.040 --> 10:17.640
right off the stage.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.720
Ray, you practiced 
 until the middle of the night.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.160
You won't mess up.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.440
Dad, what are you doing here?

10:39.440 --> 10:43.840
Well, it took some doing 
 but I got the afternoon off.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.920
I wanted to be here 
 for your audition.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.040
I don't think parents are allowed.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.360
Definitely not-- 
 no parents allowed.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.440
Well, there's no law 
 that says a guy can't wait

10:54.440 --> 10:56.760
and listen outside the door, 
 is there?

10:56.760 --> 10:59.680
I don't know, Alex, 
 is there a law like that?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.720
Um, no, I don't think so.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.920
[squeaks]

11:36.800 --> 11:39.040
[playing off-key]

11:41.400 --> 11:43.560
[squeaking]

11:50.160 --> 11:53.080
[playing flawlessly]

12:11.600 --> 12:13.800
[applause]

12:14.400 --> 12:17.520
- That was great. 
 - Good job.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.040
That was excellent.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.800
- Ray! 
 - Alex, there you are.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.200
I've hardly see you all week. 
 Give me a minute, girls.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.240
You've been too busy 
 being popular.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.000
I owe it all to you.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.280
Don't think I don't know 
 what you did.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.600
Really?

12:47.600 --> 12:51.720
I could have never got through 
 that audition without your support.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.120
It was like magic.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.120
My fingers took over like 
 they had a mind of their own.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.640
I could tell.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.400
I got people to see. 
 Catch you later, Al.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.920
- Wait. Ray? 
 - Yeah?

13:05.920 --> 13:11.040
- About the audition... 
 - I know, you're proud of me.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.280
Yeah.

13:22.920 --> 13:26.600
My life is one big mistake.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.320
Robyn, you can be 
 my backstage assistant.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.800
But I was sure my act couldn't miss.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.080
Maybe people aren't ready for jokes

13:34.080 --> 13:36.880
about the decline 
 of human civilization.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.840
Gee, remember when Ray used to 
 hang out with us mere humans?

13:40.840 --> 13:43.480
Now we have to schedule 
 an appointment.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.040
He was kind of cute 
 playing that sax.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.840
I didn't know he was so good.

13:47.840 --> 13:51.280
I think it's great he found 
 something he can go after.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.200
- Yeah, but what if he's not... 
 - Ready.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.920
Have you heard him play? 
 He's ready.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.160
I mean, just look at it this way: 
 if he flops

14:01.160 --> 14:05.480
it could be a long drop to reality.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.200
[playing off-key]

14:16.720 --> 14:18.800
- Hey, Dad. 
 - Hey, Ray.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.440
How did you do on your spanish test?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.520
To be honest not so great.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.200
- I got a "C". 
 - A "C"? Ray, buddy, come on.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.520
You've got to do better than that.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.920
Ever since I put all my focus

14:30.920 --> 14:34.680
onto my music, my other subjects 
 are hurting just a little.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.640
I know you're excited 
 about your playing

14:37.640 --> 14:41.560
but until things take off for you 
 you can't ignore your other work.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.400
Okay, Dad, I'll try.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.560
Good. 
 Dinner is in ten minutes.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.360
- You want to jam afterward? 
 - I don't know.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.200
I don't want to be 
 too over-prepared.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.360
Okay, it's your call.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.640
- So, how's it going? 
 - Couldn't be better.

15:06.640 --> 15:11.240
Finding my calling at age 13 
 [sigh] is a big relief.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.400
Aren't you counting on 
 a career in music too much?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.480
I mean, 
 based on one performance?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.320
That performance changed my life.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.600
I know I'm destined 
 to be on stage.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.720
You wouldn't believe it.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.320
In practice I can't 
 come near what I did

15:25.320 --> 15:27.920
in front of the audience. 
 I was unconscious.

15:27.920 --> 15:32.760
I can believe it. 
 Ray, I helped you.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.120
I know, I told you.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.520
I couldn't have done it 
 without you.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.680
No, I've got to tell you the truth.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.640
I moved your fingers for you.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.680
You, with the big music career 
 in front of you completely froze.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.640
What? 
 I don't believe you.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.200
You're just jealous of 
 the attention I'm getting.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.120
How could you possibly even...?

15:52.120 --> 15:54.400
# E-G-E-D-C-D #

15:54.400 --> 15:56.800
# E-G-E-A-G #

15:56.800 --> 16:00.400
Oh, great, so all this attention 
 should be for you now.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.000
I just had to tell you.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.800
But tomorrow, during the solo

16:03.800 --> 16:06.480
you'll get all 
 the attention you deserve.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.200
Being left offstage? 
 You have to help me again.

16:10.200 --> 16:14.200
But you won't need my help. 
 You'll be great.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.800
No way, everyone expects 
 so much from me now.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.360
You have to help me 
 the rest of the way.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.440
It's not my fault. 
 I tried to be a good friend.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.440
What would you do 
 if you wanted to be my enemy?

16:27.120 --> 16:31.360
If you want, Ray, 
 it can be arranged.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.800
Can you go sulk somewhere else?

16:45.800 --> 16:48.080
I have no place else to go.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.240
[sighs]: 
 Ray and I are having a fight.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.640
You crazy kids.

16:52.640 --> 16:57.400
He's mad because I won't 
 help him with his sax solo.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.520
Like I, you know, 
 helped him with the audition.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.599
What do you mean by, 
 "You know, helped"?

17:05.599 --> 17:06.920
You know.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.079
Alex, you can't use your powers 
 to help your friends.

17:10.079 --> 17:13.160
- It'll backfire every time. 
 - I did it for Raymond.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.800
He's my best friend.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.000
Remember if you get caught 
 using your powers by the Plant

17:18.000 --> 17:20.960
they'll throw you in 
 a lab rat cage so fast

17:20.960 --> 17:22.760
you won't know what hit you.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.240
Will your best friend, 
 Raymond, be there then?

17:50.480 --> 17:53.280
I know I got the keys 
 here somewhere.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.400
Ray, hurry!

17:55.400 --> 17:58.400
Here they are.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.680
How you been doing?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.320
[saxophone playing]

18:32.400 --> 18:37.440
I've changed my mind. 
 I'll do whatever you wany me to do.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.400
What changed your mind?

18:39.400 --> 18:42.280
Let's say I haven't 
 slept well since our fight.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.520
Yeah, it bothered me, too.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.800
Thanks for doing this, Alex.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.880
Ray, if I were in some 
 scary cage at the Plant

18:50.880 --> 18:52.280
would you get me out?

18:52.280 --> 18:55.840
I'd chew through the bars 
 with my teeth.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.360
In my dreams, you had the keys.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.800
I did? That's funny.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.680
I'm always losing my keys.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.200
[piano playing]

19:07.200 --> 19:09.680
Now, Ray, remember to 
 stand in the light

19:09.680 --> 19:12.000
when it's time for your solo, okay?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.560
Looks like this entire crowd's 
 here for you.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.880
Oh, and don't stand too close 
 to the edge of the stage.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.840
That orchestra pit is 
 at least a 20-foot plunge.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.760
- Dad! 
 - A little nervous?

19:31.760 --> 19:34.160
- Nervous? Me? 
 - Naw.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.280
That's all right. 
 Just try to remember to have fun.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.160
This is your day, you know. 
 I'm so proud of you.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.280
You've done this all on your own.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.600
And that's the most important 
 thing about all this.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.520
- Dad, I... 
 - Ray, you're almost on.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.080
I better get back out 
 in the audience.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.760
Break a leg.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.080
I wish.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.760
Rush this to Alex. 
 It's an emergency.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.160
Oh, I knew it. I knew 
 this day was ripe for disaster.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.000
Hurry!

20:30.480 --> 20:34.320
Hand this to the girl 
 in the butterfly t-shirt.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.600
[audience laughing]

21:35.920 --> 21:38.360
[playing well]

22:15.680 --> 22:20.000
- Did you? 
 - No, you did it all yourself.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.000
Thanks.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.680
Hey, Ray, that was better 
 than the other day.

22:25.680 --> 22:29.240
You know, you've got 
 quite a future ahead of you.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.200
No, thanks, Dad, I think 
 I'll retire from active competition.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.000
Retire? You're kidding me.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Dad, I'm only 13 years old. 
 If it happens, it happens.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.760
I got to try other things.

22:41.760 --> 22:46.480
I'm not ready to throw myself 
 into only one thing.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.560
Besides, I'm not crazy over solos.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.240
- You're not? 
 - I like duets.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.680
That's my boy.
