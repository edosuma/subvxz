01:26.840 --> 01:29.080
What is it? What's going on?

01:29.160 --> 01:31.120
My room just dried itself out.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.000
Miss Pentangle!

01:40.760 --> 01:42.000
Who's Miss Pentangle?

01:42.080 --> 01:45.320
- The coolest head teacher.
- What do you think she's doing here?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.160
Isn't it obvious?

01:48.120 --> 01:51.400
- She's here to take over.
- Miss Cackle hasn't even moved out yet.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.760
Maybe there's a way
to change the Great Wizard's mind.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.320
I think you've done enough,
Mildred Hubble.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.320
Don't blame Mildred.
Your mother stirred up the trouble.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.520
You went to the Magic Council
to speak up for Miss Cackle.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.240
And what happened? She got dismissed.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.520
Great job, Mildred Hubble.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.720
You always did like
to make an entrance, Pippa.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.560
Oh, Hecate, no harm in giving them a show!

02:17.920 --> 02:22.480
What about the time when you materialised
in the middle of the School Leavers' Ball

02:22.560 --> 02:24.840
in that silver gown and hat?

02:25.160 --> 02:27.760
I'm quite sure that wasn't me.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.840
Oh!

02:32.440 --> 02:35.240
To what do we owe the honour?

02:35.680 --> 02:38.240
The Magic Council just wanted me to pop by

02:38.320 --> 02:40.880
and put on some Modern Witching workshops.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.160
"Modern"?

02:43.720 --> 02:44.960
So, here I am.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.680
It is irregular.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.680
I really should have been informed
as acting headmistress.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.560
Absolutely, dear Hecate, and believe me,

02:52.640 --> 02:55.760
the Council has every confidence in you.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.640
They are well aware that your reputation
as a strict disciplinarian,

02:59.720 --> 03:01.640
stuck firmly in the past, is...

03:02.920 --> 03:03.920
complete fiction.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.360
Sorry, Miss Hardbroom,
some of the girls are wondering if...

03:08.560 --> 03:10.840
if Miss Pentangle
is going to be the new head?

03:12.600 --> 03:14.360
Nothing would make me leave Pentangle's.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.480
Miss Pentangle is simply here to run
some Modern Witching work...

03:19.800 --> 03:21.400
- Shops!
- Shops.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.680
Yes!

03:22.760 --> 03:24.520
Let's make a start, shall we, girls?

03:24.600 --> 03:25.680
So good!

03:29.600 --> 03:32.360
Modern Witching might be cool.

03:32.840 --> 03:33.840
It's not that.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.240
My parents are visiting
Miss Amulet's Academy today.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.320
Mum says Miss Cackle <i>is </i> the school.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.680
Without her,
they don't see the point of me staying.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.120
But Amulet's is miles away.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.280
And it's one of the places
I got expelled from.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.920
I bet they don't take people
from non-witching families.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
No.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.320
We could all end up at different schools.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.600
I do apologise, Ada.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.040
No, no, it's your office now, by rights.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.320
And you really don't need
to squash yourself away up there.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.760
Please stop tormenting yourself.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.720
I just wish I'd realised
how badly I was letting everyone down.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.800
You weren't.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.440
Eighty percent of the parents

04:29.520 --> 04:32.920
have signed a petition calling
for my dismissal.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.640
It doesn't make them right.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.640
I do not understand this appetite
for change.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.480
Even now, we have Miss Pentangle
in the building to teach "modern" magic.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.120
Miss Pentangle? Here?

04:49.440 --> 04:51.280
Doesn't that worry you, Hecate?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.640
I know Pippa.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.080
And she says
she would never leave Pentangle's.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.280
But maybe she wouldn't have to.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.560
I know that here at Cackle's,

05:03.640 --> 05:07.800
you are well aware
of the power of old chants,

05:07.880 --> 05:09.360
thanks to Miss Bat.

05:09.800 --> 05:15.360
But there are new ideas in chanting
that can also be fun to explore.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.360
- For example...
- Miss Pentangle, a word, if I may.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.880
Well, we're right in the middle of some...

05:20.960 --> 05:22.920
What about the modern chanting?

05:26.320 --> 05:28.160
You know I've always hated that.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.240
Oh! Well met, Miss Cackle.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.400
Well met, Miss Pentangle.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.840
May I say,
I'm sorry for how things have worked out.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.080
That is very easy
for you to say, Pippa.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.600
And I'm sure you wouldn't dream
of leaving Pentangle's.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.280
But perhaps, in Modern Witching,

05:49.360 --> 05:52.920
you don't have to leave one school
to run another.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
Okay.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.400
I should have told you before I arrived,
I...

05:57.520 --> 05:59.360
I've heard the Council rumours.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.480
A "super head"?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.400
It's a silly title, really.

06:04.680 --> 06:08.640
It just means
I'd be head teacher of both schools.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.760
Is one not enough for you?

06:10.840 --> 06:14.520
I... I really haven't made
any decision yet, I...

06:16.280 --> 06:17.680
Would you excuse me?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.600
I have packing to do.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.920
You weren't hoping to take over yourself,
were you?

06:35.320 --> 06:37.960
I am hoping that someone sees sense,

06:38.520 --> 06:41.040
and that Miss Cackle is reinstated.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.560
You and Ada made a great team.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.720
Maybe we could be, too.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.120
Once more, girls, give it plenty of zip!

07:01.960 --> 07:04.560
<i>♪ Eye of toad, ear of bat ♪</i>

07:04.880 --> 07:07.600
<i>♪ Tooth of wolf, tail of cat... ♪</i>

07:07.680 --> 07:09.640
Thank you, Miss Bat.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.600
Now, girls, as I was saying,

07:12.680 --> 07:17.520
old chants can be wonderful, can't they?

07:18.200 --> 07:21.760
But they could use a little more colour.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.520
<i>♪ To witching we bring ♪</i>

07:31.600 --> 07:33.560
<i>♪ This chant that we sing ♪</i>

07:34.320 --> 07:38.760
<i>♪ Moving along, together we're strong ♪</i>

07:39.080 --> 07:44.760
<i>♪ So all of us here have nothing to fear ♪</i>

07:44.880 --> 07:47.640
- Wow.
- I could never do that!

07:48.760 --> 07:51.320
- Thank you.
- Wow, so crafty!

07:51.800 --> 07:54.160
- Now, over to you.
- Oh, I don't think...

07:54.240 --> 07:57.600
You can make your chants
about anything you want.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.120
And don't worry yet about producing
the harmonies by yourselves.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.400
- Feel free to work in groups.
- But what if we can't, Miss Pentangle?

08:05.840 --> 08:08.160
"Can't" is old-fashioned thinking.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.800
Modern witches <i>can.</i>

08:16.560 --> 08:18.200
Okay. Yes, yes.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.160
If you could talk to your mum,
and she could speak to the Council...

08:25.240 --> 08:28.280
There's a petition.
Nearly all of the parents signed it.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.200
Mine didn't.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.160
- Uh, neither did mine!
- Or mine!

08:31.240 --> 08:34.200
Well, everyone else did.
So there's nothing we can do.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.400
Why don't you stop interfering for once?

08:37.480 --> 08:42.080
Girls, enough bickering.
Miss Pentangle will be here any...

08:42.159 --> 08:44.560
Ah. I... uh,

08:44.640 --> 08:46.800
wasn't sure whether to start or not.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.280
Oh, Mr. Rowan-Webb,

08:48.360 --> 08:51.280
I wouldn't dream of stepping on your toes.

08:51.760 --> 08:56.640
Today is just about boosting morale
and building confidence.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.480
With my hand, I cast my spell...

09:03.560 --> 09:06.680
And bid you now a fond farewell!

09:08.840 --> 09:09.960
Awesome!

09:10.520 --> 09:12.840
- Oh, wow.
- Whoo-whoo!

09:13.560 --> 09:16.520
- And not a potion in sight.
- Oh.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.640
An Arcadian Invisibility spell?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.880
Oh, you know your spells, Mr. Rowan-Webb.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.200
- I...
- Now, girls.

09:25.640 --> 09:30.560
In order for this to work, you need
to focus on an object of your choice.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.480
How about Mildred's cauldron?

09:34.720 --> 09:37.320
Fingers spark and fingers rise...

09:37.640 --> 09:40.280
Cauldron, now materialise!

09:41.360 --> 09:43.160
We're meant to use potions.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.400
Some girls aren't strong enough
for this kind of magic.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.640
Mildred Hubble.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.840
Would you like to try?

09:53.320 --> 09:56.320
Oh,
I'm not sure that's a good idea...

09:58.320 --> 10:00.440
All about confidence, remember?

10:07.120 --> 10:09.160
With my hands, I cast this spell...

10:09.320 --> 10:11.680
And bid you now a fond farewell!

10:12.760 --> 10:14.720
I did it! I really did it!

10:14.800 --> 10:16.840
I could never do that the old way!

10:21.880 --> 10:25.720
<i>♪ Flying east and flying west ♪</i>

10:26.120 --> 10:29.400
<i>♪ We are witches at our best ♪</i>

10:29.480 --> 10:33.000

- Potions, spells, smells...

10:36.080 --> 10:40.320

10:50.600 --> 10:53.840
- It's no good. It's too much for me.
- Don't give up.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.920
Let's give it another try.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.920
One, two, three.

10:58.920 --> 11:03.160
<i>♪ Yes, we are young

11:11.360 --> 11:12.640
Oh! Oh...

11:13.120 --> 11:14.120
Oh, dear.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.400
I did try to tell Miss Pentangle.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.360
Break time, girls.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.400
And where is Miss Pentangle?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.920
Thanks for earlier.
Why did you do it?

11:51.280 --> 11:54.080
We all need a little boost sometimes,
that's all.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.840
I don't think Miss Hardbroom
would approve of enhanced powers.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.240
Well, Miss Hardbroom and I

12:00.320 --> 12:02.880
agree to disagree on many things.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.240
It'll all wear off by tomorrow, anyway.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.000
How come you two are sitting on your own?

12:13.400 --> 12:17.400
I need to think of a way to prove
Miss Cackle should still be head teacher.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.680
The Magic Council weren't listening.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.400
And if she goes, Maud's parents
are gonna send her to Miss Amulet's.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.520
- I know it seems unfair.
- Because it is!

12:26.880 --> 12:29.600
Mrs. Hallow's got it in for Miss Cackle.
Miss Cackle's the best.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.240
I know. I think the Council know, too.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.480
But, well,
they can't ignore the parents' petition.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.560
Though giving it to her
as a keepsake seemed cruel,

12:38.640 --> 12:40.080
even for Ursula Hallow.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.120
I didn't just say that.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.600
You should go to chanting.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.520
And try not to be too gloomy.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.560
Who knows what next year will bring?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.720
She <i>is </i> going to be the new head.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.560
Two years studying the old ways,

13:06.640 --> 13:09.480
and now it's going to be this drivel
forevermore.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.240
Thank you, Mildred.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.480
Um... Your parents signed the petition
against Miss Cackle, right?

13:15.560 --> 13:17.800
No way. They love Miss Cackle.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.200
Your parents signed it, though?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.520
- No.
- No.

13:21.880 --> 13:25.160
Mildred Hubble, will you please focus on...

13:26.440 --> 13:30.440
Oh, never mind, do what you like.
I suppose that's the "modern" way.

13:32.040 --> 13:36.480
I want to see this petition.
It must be in Miss Cackle's office.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.840
Millie, I'm not sure that's a good id...

13:40.120 --> 13:42.760
I'm being sent to another academy.
What do I care?

13:42.960 --> 13:43.960
Go for it.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.880
With my hand, I cast this spell...

13:51.960 --> 13:54.000
And bid you now a fond farewell!

13:57.320 --> 13:58.320
Uh...

13:58.400 --> 14:00.640
Were you lacking confidence this time,
Millie?

14:00.720 --> 14:01.720
No.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.280
I don't want to faint again.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.800
No one will notice
if you sit this one out.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.960
With my hand, I cast this spell...

14:23.680 --> 14:25.880
And bid you now a fond farewell!

14:27.440 --> 14:28.760
It's not happening.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.000
Here, try something smaller.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.200
This is so unfair.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.040
Don't worry. Today's about having fun.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.320
It's not much fun when you can't do it.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.720
It has to be in here somewhere.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.440
Come on, puss, where is it?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.320
- Pippa.
- You look cross, Hecate.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.240
I think. Always was hard to tell.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.760
Come on, where is it?

15:16.840 --> 15:20.120
Would you step into my office, please?

15:20.920 --> 15:21.760
Oh, no.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.080
No!

15:32.440 --> 15:36.280
I expect you mean well,
but the girls simply aren't strong enough.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.360
There are some very talented witches
in this school.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.600
It can lead to all sorts of problems.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.000
They should not be doing magic
they aren't ready for.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.360
Sybil Hallow fainted.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.160
Oh! Poor Sybil.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.680
Well, she didn't say anything.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.480
- Where's she gone?
- Who?

15:58.360 --> 15:59.960
Don't treat me like a bat brain.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.240
She's... right here.
We're just messing around.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.920
Fingers spark, fingers rise,

16:10.480 --> 16:12.680
Mildred Hubble, materialise.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.040
Sybil has enough self-confidence issues

16:15.120 --> 16:16.960
without you adding to them.

16:17.080 --> 16:21.520
Well, well, what a surprise.
She's interfering again, isn't she?

16:22.240 --> 16:25.160
She's going to be in trouble
when Miss Hardbroom finds out.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I appreciate
some of the girls will need some support

16:32.080 --> 16:35.920
whilst they adjust,
but my ways work, Hecate.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.160
I know your ways of old.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.080
All very well,

16:40.160 --> 16:42.200
me, turning up
in a silver gown to the dance,

16:42.280 --> 16:44.720
you had to turn up in a gold one.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.400
Oh. Did I? I don't remember.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.800
Why was it always so important for you
to be better than me, Pippa?

16:52.880 --> 16:56.240
Is that why you want to run this school
as well as your own?

16:56.320 --> 16:59.840
Well, actually, I've come to a decision
about that, Hecate...

17:00.840 --> 17:03.200
- What on Earth?
- Go, go, go.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.680
Oh! Poor little thing was startled.

17:07.079 --> 17:10.359
So would you be, if you suddenly
had to look for a new home.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.319
Enter!

17:13.440 --> 17:16.720
Sorry to interrupt Miss Hardbroom,
but Mildred Hubble has disappeared.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.640
She used the invisibility spell
to get out of chanting.

17:20.720 --> 17:24.440
This is exactly the sort of problem
I was referring to.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.920
Thank you, Ethel.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.680
- You're a good witch, Sybil.
- It's not enough. I'm a Hallow.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.960
I should be able to do modern magic
standing on my broomstick.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.600
I realise I no longer teach here,

17:56.680 --> 17:59.080
but do you think I might be of assistance?

18:03.560 --> 18:04.560
We got your message.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.400
Miss Pentangle is here to take over.
She's going to run both schools.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.720
This'll be a Pentangle's too?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.520
- I'll be expelled in a week.
- And I'll be at Miss Amulet's.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.240
Yes, but it got me thinking.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.560
Who stands to gain from all this?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.560
The petition. You found it.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.040
Right, so...

18:25.360 --> 18:27.160
"Bella Twigg, Lucian Twigg...

18:28.240 --> 18:30.880
- "Fenella Foxglove?"
- Felicity's mum.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.800
But Felicity said
her parents didn't sign it.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.400
"Mavis Spellbody, Gordon Spellbody."

18:38.480 --> 18:39.840
My mum and dad!

18:40.760 --> 18:42.040
<i>My </i> mum and dad!

18:42.400 --> 18:45.280
That is full of signatures
from people who never signed it.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.320
Either they're all weasels,
or something's very wrong.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.240
Aha! I knew there was one.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.400
True Author Spell.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.240
"To uncover cheats and tricksters."

18:57.400 --> 18:59.120
It sounds perfect!

18:59.760 --> 19:01.240
But it's level seven.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.040
And Miss Pentangle boosted my powers
for the day.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.840
So it's got to be worth a try.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
I see.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.440
So when you tried to do it,

19:12.520 --> 19:15.280
you couldn't make things vanish
like you usually can?

19:17.160 --> 19:18.160
All right.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.240
Let me show you how it's done.

19:24.120 --> 19:28.040
What shall we vanish?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.520
Maglet, maglet on the table,

19:38.600 --> 19:41.760
let me vanish you if I'm able.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.440
Oh, dear.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.800
I don't seem to be very good
at modern magic, do I?

19:48.880 --> 19:50.320
That makes two of us.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.360
Try this instead.

19:58.520 --> 20:02.880
But, Miss Cackle,
we were supposed to do it without potions.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.520
The old ways may not be stylish, Sybil,

20:06.440 --> 20:07.440
but they work.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Now...

20:11.120 --> 20:13.120
remember your potion classes.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.040
Thistle dull, lungwort bright...

20:22.560 --> 20:24.960
hide this object from our sight.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.640
Yes!

20:30.880 --> 20:34.000
Thank you, Miss Cackle.
For everything.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.800
Thanks, Miss Cackle.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.720
You're a wonderful teacher, Miss Cackle.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.680
I think maybe you've taught me
a thing or two.

20:56.720 --> 21:00.520
A pity the parents do not share
your feelings, Miss Pentangle.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.280
And how precisely
did you come by that petition?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.920
Please, just watch, Miss Hardbroom.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.480
Write anew, make it true.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.520
Mildred, wait!

21:23.360 --> 21:24.920
No! Put it out!

21:27.960 --> 21:30.880
What just happened?

21:30.960 --> 21:34.800
Mildred, you used powder
with enhanced powers.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.040
Whatever you were trying to do,
it was way too much for it.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.600
New magic, same old faces in detention.

21:44.560 --> 21:48.920
I'll see you after school, Mildred Hubble.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.680
Modern witching.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.680
It certainly does bring change.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.600
Mildred?

22:07.120 --> 22:08.200
I'm sorry.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.680
Coming here has reminded me
that newer isn't always better.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.480
If I hadn't given you
those extra magic powers...

22:17.560 --> 22:19.320
We could have saved Miss Cackle.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.640
We could have proved the petition
was faked.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.120
What? Are you sure?

22:27.720 --> 22:30.240
Yes. And I think I know who by.

22:31.120 --> 22:35.400
Mildred. You're certain you know
who faked that petition?

22:40.040 --> 22:42.160
<i>How are you finding Cackle's?</i>

22:42.520 --> 22:45.840
<i>- Much old-fashioned thinking to overcome?</i>
- Your Greatness,

22:45.920 --> 22:49.920
this is an academy that understands
what witching is all about.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.000
Remembering who we really are.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.600
I'd officially like
to take my hat out of the ring.

22:55.680 --> 22:59.720
I cannot be considered
when the true headmistress of this academy

23:00.360 --> 23:01.400
is Ada Cackle.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.840
<i>The Council have made their decision.</i>

23:03.920 --> 23:06.120
But what if new evidence
had come to light?

23:08.120 --> 23:11.200
But, Miss Hardbroom,
I really worry that with Miss Cackle gone,

23:11.280 --> 23:14.080
Mildred Hubble will be allowed
to go unchecked.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.440
Chaos will reign.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.000
Great Wizard!

23:22.360 --> 23:23.200
Well met.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.560
- This had better be good.
- Oh, it is.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.520
You have been wrongly ousted, Miss Cackle.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.360
Mildred Hubble has a theory.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.720
I think somebody faked all the signatures
on the petition.

23:38.760 --> 23:43.960
- You dragged me here because this girl...
- We shall solve this the old way.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.400
Bottled mists of time.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.800
The petition.
It's going back in time.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.080
Mildred was right!
Only one person signed the petition.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.120
Ursula Hallow?

24:21.840 --> 24:23.080
Sorry, Ethel.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.640
Do you mind?

24:36.920 --> 24:38.080
Oh!

24:39.000 --> 24:40.920
How do you explain this?

24:43.040 --> 24:44.360
Uh, ahem.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.760
The parents have made
their feelings known and...

24:49.840 --> 24:52.280
Mother, you're embarrassing yourself.

24:52.840 --> 24:53.920
And me.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.360
Well...

24:59.200 --> 25:02.960
Well, Miss Cackle had to go
for what she did to my Esmerelda.

25:03.880 --> 25:04.880
Mother...

25:05.680 --> 25:07.800
What about <i>my </i> education?

25:08.280 --> 25:10.560
Does that not matter to you one bit?

25:10.640 --> 25:13.360
I have a non-magical daughter at home.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.880
Do you think I have time
to think about anything else?

25:16.960 --> 25:19.200
Your place
on the Council is revoked.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.960
What? No. Please.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.280
- And there will be further punishments.
- Your Greatness?

25:26.040 --> 25:27.760
Would you go easy on her?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.920
For the sake of Ethel and her sisters.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.960
I'll take it into consideration.
You are owed an apology.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.160
And...

25:37.160 --> 25:38.480
a reinstatement.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.560
Your Greatness?

25:41.640 --> 25:44.000
Will you resume
headmistress duties?

25:44.120 --> 25:45.680
With immediate effect?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.280
Of course.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.160
Nothing would please me more.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.720
This is all your fault.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.800
- Goodbye, girls.
- Bye.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.200
I should get flying.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.640
Miss Pentangle,
I was hoping to get an interview.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.040
You're such an inspiration.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.480
Perhaps next time.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.080
And your head teacher
is a greater inspiration

26:21.160 --> 26:22.560
than I ever could be.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.360
Hecate?

26:28.840 --> 26:31.840
I never wanted to be better than you.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.360
I wanted to be <i>like </i> you.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.400
You're the witchiest witch I ever knew,
and you always will be.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.280
Goodbye, Hecate.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.800
Goodbye, Pippa.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.760
Thank you.
What you did took real courage.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.760
It's Mildred you should thank.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.560
Thank you, Mildred.
Your instincts were spot-on.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.400
So you're definitely staying?

27:20.440 --> 27:22.760
Yes, Mildred, I am.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.960
And for a long while yet.

27:26.680 --> 27:27.680
Bye!
