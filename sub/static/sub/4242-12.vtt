00:01.584 --> 00:03.920
<i>La cucaracha!</i>

00:04.086 --> 00:07.424
<i>Oh, oh!
La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

00:07.590 --> 00:09.134
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

00:09.300 --> 00:11.511
<i>Ya no puede caminar</i>

00:11.677 --> 00:13.513
<i>Porque le falta</i>

00:13.679 --> 00:15.098
<i>Porque le falta</i>

00:15.264 --> 00:16.079
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

00:16.204 --> 00:18.060
<i>Marihuana que fumar</i>

00:18.226 --> 00:20.312
<i>Yo estoy harto de que me digan...</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:23.174
<i>I should have known
by the looks on my students' faces</i>

00:23.299 --> 00:24.858
<i>that I'd really stepped in it.</i>

00:25.024 --> 00:27.762
<i>My yearly rendition of
"La Cucaracha"on Taco Tuesday</i>

00:27.887 --> 00:29.404
<i>used to be such a hit.</i>

00:29.570 --> 00:31.498
<i>The truth is, I'm ashamed.</i>

00:31.623 --> 00:33.450
<i>To be a teacher is to offer students</i>

00:33.616 --> 00:35.285
<i>a gateway to the future,
and I blew it.</i>

00:35.511 --> 00:37.496
<i>How could I have
become so out of touch?</i>

00:39.565 --> 00:40.608
William...

00:40.733 --> 00:42.009
What do you mean,
you received complaints?

00:42.134 --> 00:44.178
- Who complained?
- I can't tell you that.

00:44.303 --> 00:46.897
But I can tell you that
your teaching skills

00:47.022 --> 00:49.317
have been seriously
brought into question.

00:49.442 --> 00:51.485
Look, I-I know I'm not
a native Spanish speaker.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.537
- Sometimes I get a little tripped up...
- William.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.539
Will you please remove
that enormous sombrero

00:55.664 --> 00:57.391
so I can break it down for you.

00:58.589 --> 01:01.144
As you may have heard,
our history teacher, Mrs. Hagberg,

01:01.310 --> 01:03.271
has been forced into retirement

01:03.437 --> 01:04.690
due to some memory problems.

01:05.147 --> 01:09.069
And that's how Germany
won the Second World War.

01:09.512 --> 01:11.780
Hagberg was a tenured
teacher at this school

01:11.946 --> 01:13.156
for over 40 years.

01:13.432 --> 01:16.894
Her departure means there's
an open tenured position

01:17.019 --> 01:18.161
here at McKinley.

01:18.327 --> 01:20.231
Oh, Principal Figgins...

01:20.356 --> 01:21.715
Emma and I just got engaged.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.000
We'll be starting a family soon.
I need that tenure.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.336
And I would love
to give it to you, William.

01:26.502 --> 01:28.356
But you're only one
of several teachers

01:28.481 --> 01:30.549
I'm considering for this position.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.135
And to be frank, you have
a public relations problem.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.761
If you want the tenure,

01:34.927 --> 01:36.096
you've got to turn it
around in the class.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.014
O-Okay.
How do I do that?

01:38.180 --> 01:39.233
You're a Spanish teacher.

01:39.358 --> 01:41.226
Maybe you should try
learning Spanish.

01:42.476 --> 01:45.313

01:46.564 --> 01:47.649
Señor Martinez?

01:49.421 --> 01:51.027
You can call me David.

01:51.193 --> 01:52.346
David, I am thrilled

01:52.471 --> 01:54.614
that Spanish has so many
different ways to say

01:54.780 --> 01:57.802
"to be," but right now
what I need to do

01:57.927 --> 01:59.920
is to learn how to say,

02:00.045 --> 02:02.789
"Stop using my toilet," to my maid.

02:02.955 --> 02:05.667
I was hoping you could tell me
what the word "gordita" means.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.211
I know we're all here
for different reasons.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.814
Most of you need your GEDs,

02:09.939 --> 02:11.840
some of you want to
go to Cabo San Lucas

02:12.006 --> 02:13.341
and order like a local.

02:13.507 --> 02:16.386
But did you know that the U.S.
census believe that by 2030

02:16.552 --> 02:18.805
the majority of Americans
will use Spanish

02:18.971 --> 02:20.324
as their first language?

02:20.449 --> 02:22.276
You're not here learning a language.

02:22.401 --> 02:25.446
You're here 'cause you're smart.
And you're forward thinkers.

02:25.571 --> 02:28.148
I'm sorry. I'm trying to listen,
but you got some beautiful teeth.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074

02:38.917 --> 02:41.041
<i>Asi que repiten conmigo.</i>
Come on, repeat with me.

02:52.546 --> 02:53.840
Very good. Thank you so much.

02:54.006 --> 02:55.826
Remember, roll those "R"s.

02:55.951 --> 02:57.803
Exactly.

02:57.969 --> 02:58.812
Hey, I'm Will Schuester.

02:58.937 --> 03:01.115
I teach Spanish here during the day.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.433
Can I buy you a cup of café?

03:03.599 --> 03:04.643
Sure.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.562
There's something kind of fun and
rebellious about being here at night.

03:07.728 --> 03:08.772
It's depressing.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.375
- No offense.
- No. No, um...

03:11.500 --> 03:13.568
Why don't you get a job
teaching regular high school?

03:13.734 --> 03:15.529
Have you seen the news?
Budgets are being cut,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.155
there's a hiring freeze...

03:22.368 --> 03:24.412
You know, could you maybe
say that a little slower?

03:24.578 --> 03:26.140
I think your accent's
throwing me off.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.601
- Where you from?
- Ohio.

03:27.869 --> 03:29.393
But my parents are from Chile,

03:29.518 --> 03:31.253
and we only spoke Spanish
in the house, growing up.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.680
Oh.

03:32.805 --> 03:34.756
How-how long have you been,
uh, working here?

03:34.922 --> 03:36.617
Just a few months.
This is...

03:36.742 --> 03:38.702
actually the beginning
of my career change.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.429
For the last six years,
I was a tooth model.

03:41.595 --> 03:44.391
It's like a hand model,
but with your teeth.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.434
Man, your teeth are really white.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.354
Yeah, no coffee,
no cigarettes, no beets.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.798
I was the top tooth model
in the country.

03:50.923 --> 03:53.334
Colgate, Crest Whitestrips,
Sensodyne...

03:53.459 --> 03:54.568
Whenever they needed a smile
for their advertisement,

03:54.734 --> 03:56.278
they would call on Dave Martinez.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.222
Wow, that sounds like a great gig.

03:58.347 --> 04:00.090
What... why'd you stop?

04:00.364 --> 04:01.475
Well, one day I...

04:01.600 --> 04:04.094
I realized I was spending
so much time flossing, I...

04:04.219 --> 04:06.454
I was missing my life.
I want to make a difference

04:06.620 --> 04:07.914
that lasts longer
than a grin, you know?

04:08.080 --> 04:10.384
I-I want to teach kids.

04:10.509 --> 04:13.070
I want to give them something useful.

04:13.195 --> 04:15.630
Something they can...
they can take with them

04:15.796 --> 04:16.923
their whole lives.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.425
I want to help them
find their <i>duende</i>.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.778
- You know <i>duende</i>, right?
- Of course.

04:20.903 --> 04:22.496
<i>Duende</i>, yeah.

04:22.621 --> 04:24.398
Now, you also teach Glee Club, right?

04:24.523 --> 04:26.683
- I do.
- You see, that's... that's inspiring.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.587
I actually wanted to try forming
the night school Glee Club,

04:29.712 --> 04:31.688
but meeting after school
means 2:00 in the morning.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.732
- Ah, right.
- I love to sing.

04:34.380 --> 04:37.527
I actually learned English
watching reruns of <i>Solid Gold</i>.

04:37.693 --> 04:38.612
Wait. You're serious?

04:38.778 --> 04:40.247
Yeah. They-they've done
studies on it.

04:40.372 --> 04:42.933
The brain takes in information,
like a new language,

04:43.058 --> 04:45.586
or a math equation, much more quickly

04:45.711 --> 04:47.579
and retains it better,
when that information

04:47.745 --> 04:49.089
is delivered through music.

04:49.214 --> 04:52.500
Well, there's a lot
of <i>duende</i> involved, too.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.587
You know what I would do
if I was teaching Glee Club?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.422
Latin music. Think about it.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.132
You get those kids
singing in Spanish,

04:59.298 --> 05:00.367
and they'll be learning the language

05:00.492 --> 05:02.369
without even realizing it.

05:02.494 --> 05:04.989
<i>If I could have some
of my Glee kids speaking Spanish</i>

05:05.114 --> 05:07.675
<i>by the end of the week,
it'd be a hell of an accomplishment.</i>

05:07.800 --> 05:10.018
<i>That's Teacher of the Year stuff.</i>

05:10.184 --> 05:12.228
Twice a day, you boys stain

05:12.394 --> 05:14.940
your mother's drapes,
or befoul a gym sock

05:15.106 --> 05:16.775
that has to jump from the hamper
straight into therapy.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.752
Why not head on
down to the clinic,

05:18.877 --> 05:21.279
and put your virile
teen years to good use?

05:21.445 --> 05:23.123
You'll have five bucks more
than when you walked in,

05:23.248 --> 05:25.992
and the gratitude of
lonely ovaries everywhere.

05:26.158 --> 05:26.952
But not you.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.954
You can keep tossing your tissues
into the trash.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.080
I was in an accident.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.499
Still.
Same goes for you, Porcelain.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.584
Let the strangeness end with you.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.753
What's going on, Sue?

05:37.707 --> 05:39.714
Well, William,
I'm just trying to instill

05:39.880 --> 05:41.591
the spirit of giving
in your students.

05:41.757 --> 05:44.161
No, honestly, I, uh...

05:44.286 --> 05:47.331
was a little bit dismayed
by the quality of men

05:47.456 --> 05:49.516
holding Dixie cups
down at the sperm bank

05:49.682 --> 05:50.934
this morning.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.286
Zero viable options.

05:52.411 --> 05:54.688
Looked like the cast
from <i>Ice Road Truckers</i>.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.691
So I thought it'd be best
if I found a sperm donor here.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.026
H-Hold on a second.
You're serious?

06:00.192 --> 06:01.679
Yes, William.

06:01.804 --> 06:03.822
I have decided to have a child.

06:07.032 --> 06:08.302
Um, wow.

06:08.427 --> 06:10.537
I guess I just never saw you
as the mothering type.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.273
Well, I resent that, William.

06:12.398 --> 06:14.416
I have a very strong
mothering instinct.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.167
I had it with my sister.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.645
I have it with Becky Jackson.

06:17.770 --> 06:20.981
I like to think I play
a parenting role in her life.

06:21.106 --> 06:24.818
And like so many women who
chose career over family,

06:24.943 --> 06:27.679
I've decided to take my life
in a different direction

06:27.845 --> 06:30.574
while there's still time.

06:30.699 --> 06:31.933
Are you sure that's even possible?

06:32.099 --> 06:34.161
Yes, William, I am sure.

06:34.286 --> 06:37.856
You see, I had my eggs
frozen in the late '70s.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.483
They didn't even have that
technology in the late '70s.

06:40.649 --> 06:42.944
I know.
I did it myself.

06:43.178 --> 06:46.281
The good people at Kroger
have been keeping a box

06:46.447 --> 06:48.058
of my championship ova

06:48.183 --> 06:49.534
cooling in their meat locker.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.952
And what with the financial security

06:51.118 --> 06:53.538
that will be afforded me
by the end of the week...

06:53.704 --> 06:55.832
I am finally ready

06:55.998 --> 06:58.185
to start a family.

06:58.310 --> 06:59.820
Now, I don't know if
you've heard, William,

06:59.945 --> 07:01.046
but there's a tenured position

07:01.212 --> 07:02.714
opening up at our school.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.091
- And I'm a shoe-in.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:05.257 --> 07:07.778
What makes you so sure you're
the one who's gonna get tenure?

07:08.052 --> 07:09.279
Seniority, William.

07:09.404 --> 07:11.639
I'm first in line, and also,
I'm a proven champion.

07:11.805 --> 07:15.669
And now seeing as how I find
bald infants terrifying,

07:15.794 --> 07:17.738
I'm going to need a few
ounces of your baby gravy

07:17.863 --> 07:20.648
to ensure Sue Sylvester Jr.
is born with a full head of hair.

07:20.814 --> 07:22.358
Coach?

07:22.524 --> 07:25.361
Principal Figgins wants
to see you in his office.

07:26.037 --> 07:28.766
Looks like I got my tenure.

07:28.891 --> 07:31.251
Cheerleading magazines
are right here.

07:31.376 --> 07:33.210
Have fun.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.443
Complaints?

07:39.568 --> 07:41.945
Who's complaining about
my teaching style?

07:42.211 --> 07:44.097
I can't tell you that, Sue.

07:44.222 --> 07:45.949
A student who shall remain anonymous.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.865
Well, then, who's this?

07:48.527 --> 07:50.595
Sue, this is the talented
and enchanting

07:50.761 --> 07:52.764
Olympian Roz Washington.

07:52.930 --> 07:53.973
Coach of the McKinley

07:54.139 --> 07:55.942
synchronized swimming team.

07:56.067 --> 07:58.311
Roz approached me with
some constructive criticism

07:58.477 --> 07:59.797
about your lagging Cheerios!

07:59.922 --> 08:01.281
Why should I listen to this woman

08:01.406 --> 08:02.649
give me notes

08:02.815 --> 08:03.942
about my Cheerios?

08:04.108 --> 08:06.152
Because Cheerios! didn't
win Nationals last year, Sue.

08:06.318 --> 08:09.364
And remember, you're on my short
list for the tenured position.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.241
And tenured teachers
are team players.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.868
Well, let me tell you
why ticket sales are down

08:14.034 --> 08:15.013
at sporting events.

08:15.138 --> 08:18.748
This school got cheerleaders
doing broke-ass moves from the 1950s.

08:18.914 --> 08:20.625
- Hm.
- Why don't you just admit

08:20.791 --> 08:23.187
that you're past
your competitive edge, Sue Sylvester,

08:23.312 --> 08:24.295
and let this young

08:24.461 --> 08:28.299
bronze-medal winner add some crunk

08:28.465 --> 08:30.201
to the ba-dunk-a-dunk?

08:34.298 --> 08:35.416
All right, guys!

08:35.541 --> 08:36.808
Let me ask you something.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.977
Where do you think you'll
be in the year 2030?

08:40.144 --> 08:41.813
Broadway. Twinsies!

08:41.979 --> 08:43.398
Walking.

08:43.563 --> 08:44.691
In jail, or dead. Or both.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.067
Wherever you are,

08:46.233 --> 08:48.486
whatever you're doing, you're
going to need to be able

08:48.652 --> 08:49.529
to speak Spanish.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.240
The reality is, by 2030,
more people on this planet

08:52.558 --> 08:54.784
will be speaking Spanish
than any other language.

08:54.950 --> 08:56.786
The world is changing.
Our culture is changing.

08:56.952 --> 08:58.705
And that needs to be
reflected in here.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.373
So for our next assignment,
we're only doing songs

09:00.539 --> 09:04.228
written or performed by someone
Latin, or of Latin descent.

09:04.353 --> 09:06.153
Or English songs
performed bilingually.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.547
Ooh, I'm bilingual.

09:07.806 --> 09:10.067
, Mr. Shue, though I love
that we're finally getting

09:10.192 --> 09:12.927
all Lima Sound Machine
in here, why now?

09:13.093 --> 09:14.971
Oh, Santana,
because it's long overdue.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.865
The truth is,
I love all things Latin.

09:19.266 --> 09:20.268
I mean, I love Latin food,

09:20.434 --> 09:21.662
Latin art, Latin people...

09:21.787 --> 09:23.788
You don't know any Latin people.

09:29.985 --> 09:31.863
I know. Um...
Guys, this is David Martinez.

09:32.029 --> 09:32.947
David Martinez,
this is the Glee Club.

09:33.113 --> 09:33.990
Oh, my God.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.491
- Cutest...
- smile...

09:35.657 --> 09:36.658
ever.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.346
Hello, everyone.

09:39.471 --> 09:40.413
It's a pleasure.

09:40.579 --> 09:41.915
David here is one of my

09:42.081 --> 09:44.101
many Latin friends.

09:44.226 --> 09:46.436
And, uh, he's interested
in starting his own

09:46.561 --> 09:48.555
night school Glee Club, after hours.

09:48.680 --> 09:52.258
So, uh, I invited him to come
watch us get our <i>duende</i> on.

09:52.424 --> 09:53.551
<i>Duende?</i>

09:53.717 --> 09:55.053
It means "dwarf," you ass.

09:56.011 --> 09:57.639
Now I'm completely confused.
So what's the assignment?

09:57.856 --> 10:01.118
To sing, in Spanish, with <i>duende</i>.

10:01.243 --> 10:03.186
Which, yes, literally means "dwarf,"

10:03.352 --> 10:04.914
but metaphorically, it means

10:05.039 --> 10:07.007
to have Spanish soul.

10:07.132 --> 10:09.877
To be filled with Spanish passion.

10:10.002 --> 10:11.110
Will, can I...

10:11.369 --> 10:13.547
- <i>Hablar con ellos?</i>
- That's... right.

10:13.672 --> 10:16.866
A performance with <i>duende</i>
transforms you.

10:17.032 --> 10:20.745
Makes you sing, makes you cry,
makes you laugh.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.497
Makes you want to
kiss a person you love.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.333
A song sung in Spanish
must have <i>duende</i>,

10:25.499 --> 10:26.876
or else...

10:27.042 --> 10:29.254
- Would you mind showing us?
- Oh dear God, please, yes.

10:30.272 --> 10:31.589
Be my guest.

10:31.907 --> 10:34.592
Okay. Well, I'm-I'm not a
professional like you guys,

10:34.758 --> 10:36.552
- but I'll give it a go.
- All right.

10:36.718 --> 10:37.553
Now, guys, uh...

10:37.719 --> 10:40.123
remember, Mr. Martinez
is here as our guest, okay?

10:40.248 --> 10:42.725
Let's create a safe and
supportive environment.

10:42.891 --> 10:44.619
<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!</i>

10:51.460 --> 10:52.402
<i>Yeah!</i>

10:52.568 --> 10:54.237
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:54.403 --> 10:55.672
<i>Cuando salgo a andar</i>

10:55.797 --> 10:57.824
<i>The girls be looking, like,
"Ahi esta"</i>

10:57.990 --> 10:59.292
<i>Yo se I got it aqui</i>

10:59.417 --> 11:01.119
<i>Walking down the street
in my new La Freak, yeah</i>

11:01.285 --> 11:02.829
<i>This is how I roll</i>

11:02.995 --> 11:04.956
<i>Animal print pants,
fuera de control</i>

11:05.122 --> 11:06.332
<i>And check me out con mi big Afro</i>

11:06.498 --> 11:08.668
<i>Y como Bruce Lee, right,
got the glow, yo</i>

11:08.834 --> 11:10.295
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

11:10.461 --> 11:12.046
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

11:12.212 --> 11:13.881
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

11:14.047 --> 11:15.925
<i>I-I-I work out</i>

11:16.091 --> 11:17.911
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

11:18.036 --> 11:19.429
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

11:19.595 --> 11:21.806
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

11:21.972 --> 11:22.983
<i>I-I-I work out</i>

11:23.108 --> 11:24.309
<i>Cuando hago mi entrada</i>

11:24.475 --> 11:26.086
- <i>Yeah</i>
- <i>This is what I see</i>

11:26.211 --> 11:27.228
<i>Okay</i>

11:27.445 --> 11:29.873
<i>Todo el mundo para

11:29.998 --> 11:31.733
<i>I got passion in my pants</i>

11:31.899 --> 11:34.094
<i>And I ain't afraid to show it</i>

11:34.219 --> 11:36.096
<i>Show it, show it, show it</i>

11:36.221 --> 11:39.623
<i>I'm sexy and I know it</i>

11:44.036 --> 11:45.963
<i>Soy sexy y lo sabes</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:54.314
<i>Yo, vacilón en el mall</i>

11:54.439 --> 11:56.090
<i>Security just can't fight them off</i>

11:56.324 --> 11:58.760
<i>Hanging out at the beach,
I'm in a G-stro</i>

11:59.077 --> 12:00.370
- <i>Trying to tan my cheeks</i>
- <i>What?</i>

12:00.495 --> 12:01.763
<i>This is how I roll</i>

12:01.997 --> 12:03.457
<i>Vamos, ladies, it's time to go</i>

12:03.582 --> 12:05.224
<i>Nos fuimos pa'el bar,

12:05.450 --> 12:07.769
<i>No shoes, no shirt,

12:13.315 --> 12:14.484

12:14.760 --> 12:16.861

12:28.789 --> 12:31.292
<i>I'm sexy and I know it</i>

12:31.458 --> 12:32.919
<i>Hey</i>

12:33.085 --> 12:34.862
<i>Check it out</i>

12:36.838 --> 12:38.508

12:38.674 --> 12:40.577
<i>Wiggle, wiggle,

<i>Wiggle, wiggle,

<i>Do the wiggle, man</i>

12:46.598 --> 12:48.851
<i>Es el maneo, man</i>

12:49.017 --> 12:49.852

12:50.018 --> 12:52.647
<i>Soy sexy y lo sabes</i>

12:52.813 --> 12:53.815
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

12:54.032 --> 12:55.900
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

12:56.066 --> 12:57.485

13:01.238 --> 13:02.740
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

13:02.906 --> 13:04.575
<i>Girl, look at that body</i>

13:04.741 --> 13:06.060
<i>I-I-I work out</i>

13:13.125 --> 13:15.028
<i>I'm sexy and I know it.</i>

13:15.153 --> 13:17.188
Yeah!

13:23.594 --> 13:25.388
{pub}Here is the problem.
Sam and I used to date.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.182
Then I moved away,
and now I'm bunking at Finn and Kurt's.

13:28.348 --> 13:30.643
And I started dating another guy
who I really like.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.478
But then she and I kissed.

13:32.644 --> 13:33.980
And I feel really weird about it.

13:34.205 --> 13:35.314
Just trying to figure out a way

13:35.480 --> 13:37.567
to work this out without
anyone's feelings getting hurt.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.868
Actually, you're in luck

13:38.993 --> 13:41.153
because I just got
my new series of pamphlets

13:41.278 --> 13:42.947
back from the printer,
which uniquely address

13:43.113 --> 13:44.991
the modern-day issues
of today's 21st century teen.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.410
Yes. Okay.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.169
Mm-hmm.

13:51.204 --> 13:52.415
"So You're a Two-Timin' Ho"?

13:52.581 --> 13:53.583
"So You're Dating a Two-Timin' Ho."

13:53.749 --> 13:55.613
Right? They get
your attention, don't they?

13:55.738 --> 13:57.879
I mean, that... that really
makes you want to read on.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.505
Miss Pillsbury, I don't sleep around.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.840
That's not me.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.050
- Okay.
- I'm just trying to listen to my heart,

14:03.800 --> 14:05.887
and it's like I can't hear
what it's trying to tell me.

14:06.237 --> 14:07.980
Well, if you really want to listen,

14:08.105 --> 14:09.724
then you need to stop talking.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.392
I'm serious.

14:11.558 --> 14:13.235
You know, there's a lot
of communication

14:13.360 --> 14:14.537
in your lives these days.

14:14.662 --> 14:16.322
With texting and IM'ing
and Facebooking,

14:16.447 --> 14:17.982
I mean, you don't have any quiet time

14:18.148 --> 14:20.025
with yourselves
to make informed decisions

14:20.192 --> 14:21.994
on... on your true feelings.

14:23.254 --> 14:24.322
For instance.

14:25.623 --> 14:27.241
Sam just tweeted that I smell good.

14:27.407 --> 14:29.035
I won't stop till it's trending.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.519
This is my point.

14:30.644 --> 14:32.588
I think that you and Sam
should spend a week

14:32.713 --> 14:33.998
not speaking to each other.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.625
No e-mails, no texts, nothing.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.543
And I think, at the end of that week,

14:37.668 --> 14:39.086
you'll have
a much better idea of what

14:39.252 --> 14:40.254
your true feelings are.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.597
Shh, shh. No. No.

14:41.722 --> 14:44.175
Starting... starting...

14:44.341 --> 14:45.892
now.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.270
Hooray.

14:48.395 --> 14:50.014
Not speaking.

14:59.790 --> 15:00.942
<i>Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo</i>

15:04.545 --> 15:06.505
<i>Like dang diggy diggy
d-dang a-dang dang</i>

15:06.630 --> 15:07.949
<i>Diggy dang a-diggy d-dang dang</i>

15:08.215 --> 15:09.925
<i>Diggy diggy diggy
d-dang a-dang dang</i>

15:10.050 --> 15:11.369
<i>Diggy dang a-diggy d-dang dang</i>

15:11.535 --> 15:13.129
<i>Dang diggy diggy
d-dang a-dang dang</i>

15:13.254 --> 15:15.081
<i>Diggy dang a-diggy d-dang dang</i>

15:15.247 --> 15:17.083
<i>Dang diggy diggy d-dang</i>

15:17.374 --> 15:19.794
<i>Dang diggy diggy d-dang.</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:22.638
All right, ladies.

15:22.763 --> 15:26.634
Go run and find a swimming hole
to dunk those behinds in

15:26.800 --> 15:29.617
'cause those donkey
booties need to cool off.

15:31.655 --> 15:34.116
Now, I ain't no mind reader,
Sue Sylvester,

15:34.241 --> 15:37.570
and I came from
a very superstitious household

15:37.695 --> 15:40.064
where such things are not allowed,

15:40.230 --> 15:42.958
but I got a feeling
that those Cheerios!

15:43.083 --> 15:46.195
like my modern dance moves
a little bit better

15:46.361 --> 15:47.997
than them old stale
white-bread routines

15:48.122 --> 15:49.490
you've been making them do.

15:49.656 --> 15:51.534
You know, Roz,

15:51.700 --> 15:54.503
the English language
lacks the requisite words

15:54.628 --> 15:57.956
to express just how much
I dislike you.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.375
And I'm onto you.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.976
Yeah, I've seen <i>All About Eve</i>.

16:01.101 --> 16:02.762
I know what you're planning.

16:02.887 --> 16:05.214
You're waiting for me to
take maternity leave,

16:05.380 --> 16:08.092
and then you're going to swoop
in and try to steal my job.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.135
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up. Wait.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.570
Oh, my God. Hold up.

16:11.695 --> 16:13.239
Maternity leave?

16:13.364 --> 16:14.890
Are you pulling my leg?

16:15.056 --> 16:16.325
No, I am not.

16:16.450 --> 16:19.770
I am getting pregnant,
and then I am having a baby.

16:19.936 --> 16:21.063
With whose vagina?

16:21.229 --> 16:23.399
Sue, you can't have no baby.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.067
You are old as a hill.

16:25.233 --> 16:27.369
You ain't gonna
give birth to no child.

16:27.494 --> 16:29.321
You gonna give birth to a grandchild.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.257
You gonna get in them stirrups,

16:31.382 --> 16:33.843
and you gonna push and push,

16:33.968 --> 16:35.661
and a full-grown adult gonna pop out

16:35.786 --> 16:38.205
with a briefcase and a job
talking on a cell phone.

16:38.371 --> 16:39.457
And by the way, I don't need

16:39.623 --> 16:43.085
to steal your job, Sue Sylvester.

16:43.251 --> 16:44.211
You know why?

16:44.377 --> 16:46.714
Principal Figgins
is gonna give it to me.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.307
He wouldn't.

16:48.432 --> 16:50.943
Oh, he would.

16:51.068 --> 16:52.928
You see, a long time ago,

16:53.094 --> 16:54.730
you won some trophies.

16:54.855 --> 16:56.724
And that was real impressive.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.702
I, however, am an Olympian.

16:59.827 --> 17:02.521
I won this bronze damn Olympic medal

17:02.687 --> 17:04.190
in Beijing, China.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.691
I had noodles with the president

17:05.816 --> 17:07.484
and a threesome with Michael Phelps.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.694
What you need to do

17:08.919 --> 17:10.796
is wake up and smell the menopause.

17:11.144 --> 17:14.031
You are... done... as a coach,

17:14.156 --> 17:16.135
and all the hormones in Thailand

17:16.260 --> 17:18.371
can't change the fact
that you are done as a woman.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.673
What you need to do is start praying

17:20.798 --> 17:22.375
that you give birth to a child

17:22.540 --> 17:24.093
that likes to eat sand,

17:24.218 --> 17:27.020
'cause that's all that's coming
out those old, wrinkly boobs.

17:30.006 --> 17:32.484
I can do this.

17:32.609 --> 17:34.694
I can do anything.

17:36.429 --> 17:38.197
♪

17:44.187 --> 17:46.448
How is the girl with no ass
supposed to choose

17:46.573 --> 17:49.694
between the juiced-up wolf
and the depressed vampire?

17:49.860 --> 17:50.920
She's into both of them.

17:51.045 --> 17:53.122
Oh, come on, Mercedes.
She just knows.

17:53.452 --> 17:55.758
But what if they both make her
feel amazing in different ways?

17:55.883 --> 17:58.177
Well, you don't get to choose
when it comes to true love.

17:58.302 --> 17:59.511
True love chooses you.

17:59.636 --> 18:01.513
And you better be certain
when it comes to marriage

18:01.638 --> 18:03.405
because marriage is promise,
and it lasts for forever.

18:03.530 --> 18:04.767
Ladies, I appreciate you
spending time

18:04.892 --> 18:06.101
with me while Blaine recovers,

18:06.226 --> 18:08.212
but why are you being
so weird and serious?

18:08.378 --> 18:10.396
Our periods don't come
until the end of the month.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.097
Can you guys keep a secret?

18:22.726 --> 18:24.145
Rachel, what the hell is that?

18:24.311 --> 18:25.688
It's an engagement ring.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.398
Shut up!

18:27.564 --> 18:28.607
Finn proposed.

18:28.773 --> 18:30.693
- And what did you say?
- I said yes.

18:30.859 --> 18:31.986
Rachel, have you lost your damn mind?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.738
But I love Finn.
I really, really love him.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.547
- But what about NYADA?
- It's still going to happen.

18:35.672 --> 18:37.082
I have dreams for a huge life

18:37.207 --> 18:38.492
for myself, okay,
some of which include,

18:38.658 --> 18:39.952
you know, a little bit of struggle

18:40.077 --> 18:42.004
until I can make all
of my dreams come true.

18:42.129 --> 18:44.289
They'll be great anecdotes
for the Jimmy Kimmel show.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.958
I'll call them my Top Ramen weeks.

18:46.124 --> 18:48.085
But in every single
one of my dreams...

18:48.302 --> 18:50.963
okay, struggling or not...
there he is.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.506
Finn.

18:52.672 --> 18:54.767
Look, I know that I
am going to be with Finn

18:54.892 --> 18:56.735
for the rest of my life,
just as much as I know

18:56.860 --> 18:59.510
that I am going to be
a huge star one day.

19:00.364 --> 19:01.932
So you promise not to tell anyone?

19:02.098 --> 19:03.976
Okay, I'm going home right now
to yell at Finn,

19:04.101 --> 19:05.436
because this is insane.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.354
That is not fair, Kurt.
I mean, what would

19:07.520 --> 19:09.023
you do if Blaine proposed
to you today?

19:12.609 --> 19:14.069
So will you please keep my secret?

19:14.235 --> 19:16.781
Aren't you scared
you're making the wrong choice?

19:16.997 --> 19:20.659
Look, I know that I have
the right person.

19:20.784 --> 19:24.205
Scary part was just...
choosing to know it.

19:26.340 --> 19:30.252
<i>Sometimes it's hard</i>

19:32.262 --> 19:36.300
<i>To make things clear</i>

19:38.352 --> 19:41.514
<i>Or know when to face the truth</i>

19:41.680 --> 19:43.432
<i>And I know</i>

19:43.598 --> 19:47.144
<i>That the moment is here</i>

19:49.980 --> 19:54.360
<i>So open your eyes</i>

19:55.586 --> 20:00.783
<i>And see who I am</i>

20:00.949 --> 20:03.552
<i>And not who you want</i>

20:03.677 --> 20:06.805
<i>For me to be</i>

20:06.930 --> 20:10.709
<i>I am only myself</i>

20:10.934 --> 20:13.462
<i>Myself</i>

20:13.628 --> 20:19.093
<i>Si voy a perderte ya</i>

20:19.309 --> 20:25.015
<i>Que sea por vez final</i>

20:25.181 --> 20:30.145
<i>Si voy a perderte ya</i>

20:31.455 --> 20:33.899
<i>Si voy a perderte</i>

20:34.024 --> 20:37.444
<i>Voy a perderte</i>

20:37.661 --> 20:43.909
<i>Ya...</i>

20:45.160 --> 20:48.873
<i>Yeah</i>

20:49.039 --> 20:51.667
<i>No, no vuelvas</i>

20:53.043 --> 20:55.629
<i>No, no vuelvas</i>

20:55.795 --> 20:57.882
<i>No vuelvas</i>

20:58.048 --> 21:00.426
<i>Si voy a perderte</i>

21:00.592 --> 21:05.264
<i>Ya</i>

21:21.029 --> 21:24.283
{pub}<i>Este amor llega así
de esta manera</i>

21:25.784 --> 21:27.198
<i>No tiene la culpa</i>

21:28.703 --> 21:30.661
<i>Caballo de danza vana</i>

21:30.786 --> 21:32.129

21:32.254 --> 21:33.876

21:34.042 --> 21:36.157

21:57.107 --> 22:01.445
<i>Bamboleo, bambolea</i>

22:01.611 --> 22:04.862

22:04.987 --> 22:06.867
<i>Bamboleo!</i>

22:07.033 --> 22:09.036
<i>Bambolea!</i>

22:09.202 --> 22:13.707
<i>Porque mi vida,
yo la prefiero vivir asi</i>

22:13.873 --> 22:18.045
<i>Would you dance
if I asked you to dance?</i>

22:18.211 --> 22:22.007
<i>Would you run
and never look back?</i>

22:22.173 --> 22:25.970
<i>Would you cry
if you saw me crying?</i>

22:26.136 --> 22:28.559
<i>And would you save
my soul tonight?</i>

22:30.932 --> 22:32.977
<i>I can be your hero, baby</i>

22:33.143 --> 22:35.025
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

22:35.150 --> 22:36.939
<i>I can kiss away the pain</i>

22:37.105 --> 22:39.274
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

22:39.440 --> 22:41.443
<i>I will stand by you forever</i>

22:41.609 --> 22:42.700

22:42.825 --> 22:45.569
<i>You can take my breath away</i>

22:45.694 --> 22:47.157
<i>You can take my breath away</i>

22:47.323 --> 22:52.329
<i>I can be your hero</i>

22:55.915 --> 22:59.105
Guys, that was some
<i>muy</i> serious footwork!

22:59.775 --> 23:01.296
<i>Muy</i> means "very."

23:01.462 --> 23:03.340
I was in it mostly for the boots.

23:03.506 --> 23:06.010
Yeah, what's the deal with those boots?
Because wow.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.625
They're Mexican hipster boots.
It's kind of like a fad

23:08.750 --> 23:11.557
for groups of guys that are into
dance music,

23:11.723 --> 23:13.392
and we're kind of like a dance crew.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.643
Señor Martinez told us about it.

23:14.809 --> 23:16.812
The teeth, the <i>duende</i>,

23:16.978 --> 23:18.480
the bizarre Mexican fads.
Señor Martinez is, like,

23:18.646 --> 23:20.566
the best Spanish teacher ever.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.673
I can't wait to see your
performance, Mr. Shue.

23:22.942 --> 23:24.278
My performance?

23:24.444 --> 23:26.238
Yeah, to defend
your Spanish teacher honor.

23:26.404 --> 23:29.908
I'm sure you have
something <i>muy</i> amazing planned.

23:41.419 --> 23:42.927
I take it Will told you.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.840
Yes. Will tells me everything.

23:45.006 --> 23:49.261
It is so inappropriate for you
to ask him to father your child.

23:49.427 --> 23:52.139
Have a seat, Lady Bird Hollow Pelvis.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.058
And be careful,
those chairs are hard.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.642
I know how fragile your bones are.

23:55.808 --> 23:58.609
Okay, look, I know how it feels
to want

23:58.895 --> 23:59.730
to start a family.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.065
I want to have a baby, too.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.363
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

24:02.488 --> 24:04.064
I doubt your avian frame
could withstand

24:04.189 --> 24:05.319
the rigors of childbirth.

24:05.485 --> 24:06.900
Okay, just tell me, why Will?

24:07.960 --> 24:10.240
You hate him.
You've made that very clear.

24:10.406 --> 24:12.039
Well, In case you haven't
noticed, Deena,

24:12.164 --> 24:13.660
I have a little bit of a mean streak.

24:13.826 --> 24:17.027
I'm cunning, I'm vindictive,
I spend a large portion

24:17.152 --> 24:19.964
of every day vibrating
with a palpable sense

24:20.089 --> 24:21.923
of wild, irrational rage.

24:23.920 --> 24:28.050
And I don't ever want my kid
to feel that.

24:28.216 --> 24:31.392
And every time I've insulted Will

24:31.517 --> 24:33.310
or tried to stop him in his crusade

24:33.435 --> 24:36.063
to ruin pop culture
by wiping his woolly behind

24:36.188 --> 24:38.143
with the American songbook,

24:38.309 --> 24:44.024
he's always risen up
and met me with kindness.

24:44.190 --> 24:47.861
If goodness and optimism
are somehow genetic,

24:48.027 --> 24:50.952
that's what I want for my child.

24:57.209 --> 24:59.414
He isn't gonna do it, is he?

24:59.580 --> 25:01.250
I prefer to let him tell you that.

25:01.416 --> 25:05.259
I'm really sorry, Sue.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.378
You know, for what it's worth,

25:07.503 --> 25:10.221
I... I think you should have a child.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.392
I think it'd be really good for you.

25:27.741 --> 25:30.237
Hey, dude.
You want to lift some?

25:30.403 --> 25:31.869
No, thanks.

25:31.994 --> 25:33.620
I've never really understood
the whole process.

25:33.745 --> 25:36.123
Plus, I do The Tracey Anderson Method

25:36.248 --> 25:38.409
in the comfort and privacy
of my own bedroom.

25:38.534 --> 25:39.567
Hmm.

25:41.870 --> 25:45.210
Why don't you pick up these?

25:45.376 --> 25:47.051
They're from Mrs. Pillsbury.

25:47.176 --> 25:48.807
- College brochures.
- What do you got?

25:49.074 --> 25:50.757
Fordham, NYU, Adelphi.

25:50.923 --> 25:52.122
That one's in Long Island.

25:52.247 --> 25:53.957
Yeah, there's a train
station right next to the campus

25:54.082 --> 25:55.053
right into Manhattan.

25:55.219 --> 25:57.556
I think they have a football team.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.641
I think they all have musical
theater programs, too.

25:59.807 --> 26:00.981
That's sweet, dude, but you know,

26:01.106 --> 26:02.186
college isn't for everyone.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.478
Neither is marriage.

26:04.937 --> 26:06.607
I can't believe she told you.

26:06.773 --> 26:09.234
I can't believe you didn't.
We're supposed to be brothers.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.807
Look, I didn't want to put you in

26:10.932 --> 26:11.875
an awkward position with Burt, okay?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.363
I don't want him to know yet.

26:13.529 --> 26:14.445
Hey, you think something

26:14.570 --> 26:16.029
you have to keep
from everyone you love

26:16.154 --> 26:18.118
might not be the best idea in
the first place?

26:18.284 --> 26:20.084
Don't get down on me
about this, dude.

26:20.209 --> 26:21.985
Rachel's, like, the only good
thing I've got going

26:22.110 --> 26:23.207
in my life right now.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.000
No, she isn't, Finn.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.669
Look, I get you've had a rough
year with finding out

26:27.835 --> 26:29.922
who your dad really is and-and
losing the scholarship,

26:30.088 --> 26:33.630
but you're a star, Finn,
just as bright as Rachel.

26:33.755 --> 26:35.177
You just don't believe in yourself.

26:35.343 --> 26:36.967
Yeah, well, the proof's in
the pudding, okay?

26:37.092 --> 26:39.348
And my pudding pretty much sucks.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.189
Look, I'm not telling you that
you shouldn't marry Rachel.

26:42.314 --> 26:43.977
I love her despite all of her crazy,

26:44.143 --> 26:47.064
and I think that you'd be
lucky to marry her... one day.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.946
But I don't want you just to
turn yourself into nothing

26:49.071 --> 26:50.901
but the guy who holds her purse
on the red carpet.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.316
Look, I'm getting to the
point in my life where

26:52.441 --> 26:54.446
I kind of need to be honest with
myself about who I am.

26:54.612 --> 26:55.822
And who is that?

26:55.988 --> 26:57.754
Not you.

26:57.879 --> 27:00.452
Not Rachel.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.659
That's the point, Finn.

27:02.784 --> 27:05.415
There are plenty of us, trust me.

27:05.581 --> 27:09.002
The one thing that Glee Clubs
and theater programs don't have

27:09.168 --> 27:11.964
is the hot, straight football player
who can sing and sort of dance.

27:13.805 --> 27:15.429
You're unique, Finn.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.925
And I can't see this proposal
thing as anything else

27:18.050 --> 27:20.013
but you giving up on yourself.

27:20.179 --> 27:22.470
No, no, it's not.

27:25.057 --> 27:27.020
At least I don't...
I don't think it is.

27:28.585 --> 27:30.335
Your time isn't up, Finn.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.513
It's just beginning.

27:36.351 --> 27:37.851
Hey, Kurt.

27:40.324 --> 27:42.373
Thanks.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.299
Hold it right there, Sandbacks.

27:55.606 --> 27:57.301
You and I need to
have a serious chat.

27:57.608 --> 27:59.318
Now I realize when I chose Becky

27:59.443 --> 28:00.569
as co-captain for the Cheerios!

28:00.694 --> 28:02.097
it might have rubbed
you the wrong way.

28:02.263 --> 28:03.181
Wanky.

28:03.614 --> 28:05.273
And I've often admired
the craven heartlessness

28:05.398 --> 28:07.686
of your pointless,
vindictive back-stabbing.

28:08.001 --> 28:10.045
Kind of takes me back
to the old salad days.

28:10.170 --> 28:11.982
But you crossed the Maginot Line

28:12.148 --> 28:13.900
when you started messing with
Sue Sylvester's family.

28:14.066 --> 28:16.028
What are you talking about?
What family?

28:16.194 --> 28:18.322
You lodged a complaint
about my teaching tactics

28:18.488 --> 28:20.490
with Principal Figgins,
possibly derailing my bid

28:20.747 --> 28:23.493
for tenure just when I'm trying
to have a baby!

28:23.717 --> 28:26.371
A baby? With whose vagina?

28:26.603 --> 28:28.040
Hey, what is going on here?

28:28.305 --> 28:30.649
Coach Sylvester is accusing me
of something I didn't do.

28:30.774 --> 28:33.101
Oh, stop with the lies, sweater
meat, or you will be hawking

28:33.226 --> 28:34.921
nude glossies of yourself behind
the Dumpster of Hooters

28:35.087 --> 28:36.173
by the weekend.

28:36.396 --> 28:37.406
I know you did this!

28:37.531 --> 28:38.743
Sue, enough!

28:39.035 --> 28:41.386
No one messes with my family.
No one.

28:42.869 --> 28:44.947
Oh, and you can rest your fetid,
woolly head, William.

28:45.072 --> 28:46.815
I don't need your baby spunk anymore.

28:46.940 --> 28:49.668
Got myself another donor.
And a much better one.

28:49.793 --> 28:51.243
Who?

29:05.291 --> 29:07.329
I just got my new pamphlets
back from the printer.

29:07.644 --> 29:11.223
I am feeling so Stephen King
with these things lately.

29:11.348 --> 29:13.275
You know, just so prolific.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.943
That's great, Em, but I really need

29:15.068 --> 29:16.895
to translate this song
for my big number tomorrow.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.091
It's my last chance to wow
the kids with my español.

29:19.439 --> 29:20.884
By the end of the week, I need

29:21.141 --> 29:22.651
every single one of those kids
begging Figgins

29:22.776 --> 29:24.903
to give me that tenure spot.

29:25.028 --> 29:27.155
<i>Conversación.</i>
Of course.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.658
"Conversation" in Spanish is
<i>conversación.</i>

29:35.565 --> 29:37.609
Do you realize how important
this tenure is for us,

29:37.841 --> 29:39.051
if we want to start a family?

29:39.176 --> 29:41.053
It means we will
always be able to feed our kids,

29:41.178 --> 29:43.323
get them health insurance.

29:46.049 --> 29:47.559
Emma, enough!

29:47.684 --> 29:51.003
Can't you see I'm doing
this to take care of you?

29:52.672 --> 29:55.752
Okay, I think I can
take care of myself.

29:55.918 --> 29:57.921
You know what, I'm sorry.

29:58.178 --> 29:59.855
I just wanted to show
you my new pamphlets.

29:59.980 --> 30:01.239
I'm really proud of them.

30:01.364 --> 30:04.219
They're silly, Emma.
I'm sorry, I love you,

30:04.517 --> 30:06.495
but do you really think
the kids take them seriously?

30:06.620 --> 30:07.440
Okay, you know what?

30:07.565 --> 30:09.581
I know that the titles are silly;
that's the point.

30:09.706 --> 30:11.950
Sometimes you have to
be a little provocative

30:12.075 --> 30:14.002
if you want to get
teenagers' attention.

30:14.127 --> 30:15.772
They're <i>conversación</i> starters.

30:15.938 --> 30:17.482
And you're being really mean.

30:17.714 --> 30:19.614
You got a pamphlet for that?

30:20.584 --> 30:22.279
Emma, I'm sorry.

30:22.502 --> 30:23.738
Emma, wait.

30:32.579 --> 30:34.761
<i>Como puede ser verdad?</i>

30:36.366 --> 30:40.422
<i>Last night I dreamt of San Pedro</i>

30:40.671 --> 30:44.593
<i>Just like I'd never gone,
I knew the song</i>

30:44.841 --> 30:49.421
<i>A young girl with eyes
like the desert</i>

30:49.546 --> 30:53.105
<i>It all seems like yesterday,
not far away</i>

30:53.809 --> 30:55.312
<i>Tropical the island breeze</i>

30:55.478 --> 30:57.763
<i>All of nature wild and free</i>

30:57.888 --> 30:59.191
<i>This is where I long to be</i>

30:59.357 --> 31:01.483
<i>La isla bonita</i>

31:01.608 --> 31:04.154
<i>And when the samba played</i>

31:04.320 --> 31:05.614
<i>The sun would set so high</i>

31:05.780 --> 31:08.158
<i>Ring through my ears
and sting my eyes</i>

31:08.324 --> 31:11.953
<i>Your Spanish lullaby</i>

31:12.202 --> 31:15.123
<i>I fell in love with San Pedro</i>

31:15.289 --> 31:17.148
Mr. Shue, what's with the shiny coat?

31:17.273 --> 31:18.500
I thought you were Kurt.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.546
I'm an authentic Spanish matador.

31:21.712 --> 31:25.509
<i>Te dijo te amo</i>

31:25.675 --> 31:29.262
<i>I prayed that the days would last,
they went so fast</i>

31:29.428 --> 31:31.306
<i>Tropical the island breeze</i>

31:31.472 --> 31:33.515
<i>All of nature wild and free</i>

31:33.640 --> 31:35.467
<i>This is where I long to be</i>

31:35.592 --> 31:37.979
<i>La isla bonita</i>

31:38.145 --> 31:40.355
<i>And when the samba played</i>

31:40.480 --> 31:42.057
<i>The sun would set so high</i>

31:42.182 --> 31:43.610
<i>Ring through my ears
and sting my eyes</i>

31:43.776 --> 31:47.145
<i>Your Spanish lullaby</i>

31:47.270 --> 31:51.243
<i>Yo quiero estar
donde el sol toca el cielo</i>

31:51.409 --> 31:53.453
<i>Cuando es hora de siesta</i>

31:53.619 --> 31:55.120
<i>Tu los puedes ver pasar</i>

31:55.245 --> 31:57.791
<i>Caras tan bellas</i>

31:57.957 --> 32:00.085
<i>Se importan nada</i>

32:00.333 --> 32:05.298
<i>Where a girl loves a boy,
and a boy</i>

32:05.464 --> 32:06.758
<i>Loves a girl</i>

32:06.924 --> 32:09.761
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

32:09.927 --> 32:12.504
<i>Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh oooh</i>

32:12.629 --> 32:14.873
- <i>Your Spanish lullaby</i>
- <i>Hey</i>

32:14.998 --> 32:17.394
<i>Tropical the island breeze</i>

32:17.560 --> 32:19.062
<i>All of nature wild and free</i>

32:19.228 --> 32:21.856
<i>This is where I long to be</i>

32:22.022 --> 32:23.483
<i>La isla bonita</i>

32:23.649 --> 32:25.944
<i>And when the samba played</i>

32:26.176 --> 32:28.488
<i>The sun would set so high,
ring through my ears</i>

32:28.654 --> 32:29.888
<i>And sting my eyes</i>

32:30.013 --> 32:31.699
<i>Your Spanish lullaby</i>

32:31.824 --> 32:33.368
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah</i>

32:33.534 --> 32:34.910
<i>Bop-bop-bop bop-ba</i>

32:35.035 --> 32:36.496
<i>Ooh</i>

32:36.662 --> 32:39.583
<i>Oooh, yeah</i>

32:39.749 --> 32:41.126
<i>La isla bonita</i>

32:41.292 --> 32:42.233
<i>La isla</i>

32:42.358 --> 32:44.836
<i>Bonita</i>

32:44.961 --> 32:47.575
<i>Bonita, bonita</i>

32:47.700 --> 32:50.093
<i>Your Spanish lullaby</i>

32:53.804 --> 32:55.473
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:55.639 --> 32:57.039
David Martinez.

32:59.643 --> 33:01.271
Santana, <i>fantástico.</i>

33:01.437 --> 33:02.272
David, I'm just

33:02.438 --> 33:03.922
a little... I don't know...

33:04.047 --> 33:06.547
confused about
your participation here.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.323
And, hey, wasn't
that number fantastic

33:11.489 --> 33:12.991
and truly authentic?

33:14.991 --> 33:16.536
Thank you very much, everyone.

33:16.702 --> 33:18.788
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a stack of

33:18.954 --> 33:20.582
night school exams on my desk

33:20.748 --> 33:23.335
that won't grade themselves,
so <i>buenas noches</i>.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.127
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

33:24.293 --> 33:25.253
Bye-bye.

33:25.419 --> 33:27.756
Well, Mr. Shue,
the floor is all yours.

33:27.922 --> 33:30.382
- I'm excited.
- Yay, Mr. Shue.

33:30.507 --> 33:32.374
Really, I'm excited.
Mr. Shue, you got this!

33:35.661 --> 33:37.291
{pub}<i>Ya-ha-ha-ha-hi!</i>

33:39.168 --> 33:42.504
<i>Ow-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

33:49.929 --> 33:53.490
<i>A little less conversation,
a little more action, please</i>

33:53.656 --> 33:57.827
<i>All this aggravation
ain't satisfactioning me</i>

33:57.993 --> 33:59.996
<i>A little more bite,
a little less bark</i>

34:00.162 --> 34:01.748
<i>A little less fight,
a little more spark</i>

34:01.914 --> 34:03.625
<i>Close your mouth
and open up your heart</i>

34:03.791 --> 34:05.186
<i>And baby, satisfy me</i>

34:05.311 --> 34:08.254
<i>Satisfy me, baby</i>

34:08.420 --> 34:10.340
<i>Vamos ir a los dos
escuchar la musica</i>

34:10.505 --> 34:11.942
<i>Y viajar por la brisa de verano</i>

34:12.067 --> 34:14.829
<i>Que buenisima la noche
ya te enseñe como salga</i>

34:14.954 --> 34:17.138
<i>Andale, muchacha, ven, relájate</i>

34:17.304 --> 34:20.835
<i>Menos conversación y mas
accion, por favor</i>

34:20.960 --> 34:24.521
<i>Este agravamiento no me
satisface a mi</i>

34:24.687 --> 34:27.315
<i>A ltle more bite,
a little less bark</i>

34:27.481 --> 34:29.009
<i>A little less fight,
a little more spark</i>

34:29.134 --> 34:32.637
<i>No hablas mas y abre tu
corazon y satisfaceme</i>

34:32.902 --> 34:35.614
<i>Satisfaceme, bebe</i>

34:36.282 --> 34:39.452
<i>Come on, baby,
I'm tired of talking</i>

34:39.618 --> 34:43.214
<i>Grab your coat
and let's start walking</i>

34:43.581 --> 34:47.645
<i>A little less conversation,
a little more action, please</i>

34:47.770 --> 34:52.215
<i>All this aggravation
ain't satisfactioning me</i>

34:52.380 --> 34:54.592
<i>A little more bite,
a little less bark</i>

34:54.757 --> 34:56.487
<i>A little less fight,
a little more spark</i>

34:56.612 --> 34:57.929
<i>Shut your mouth
and open up your heart</i>

34:58.095 --> 34:59.973
<i>And, baby, satisfy me</i>

35:00.139 --> 35:02.934
<i>Satisfy me, baby</i>

35:03.100 --> 35:05.687
<i>Menos conversación y mas
accion, por favor</i>

35:05.853 --> 35:07.230
<i>Hey! Muchas gracias.</i>

35:12.818 --> 35:14.404
It was you.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.364
You're the one who complained
to Principal Figgins about me.

35:16.530 --> 35:18.908
Yeah, and I'd do it all over
again after that performance.

35:19.074 --> 35:20.627
You're messing with
adult things here, Santana.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.954
This is my job.
This is my life.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.632
And this is my education,
and it's not a joke to me,

35:25.757 --> 35:27.459
although it seems to be one to you.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.711
What are you talking about?
They all loved my performance.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.155
Because they don't know any better.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.339
It's your fault.
You're their teacher.

35:33.505 --> 35:36.717
You went from "La Cucaracha"
to a bullfighting mariachi.

35:36.842 --> 35:40.054
Why don't you just dress up
as the Taco Bell Chihuahua

35:40.220 --> 35:42.223
and bark the theme song
to <i>Dora the Explorer</i> ?<

35:42.389 --> 35:44.434
You don't even know enough
to be embarrassed

35:44.600 --> 35:46.936
about these stereotypes
that you're perpetuating.

35:47.102 --> 35:48.354
That's not fair.
Isn't it?

35:48.520 --> 35:51.399
What did you want to be
when you grew up?

35:51.565 --> 35:53.668
Why did you become
a Spanish teacher, Mr. Shue?

35:57.163 --> 35:58.164
Because...

36:03.196 --> 36:06.481
it was the only teaching
position open at the time.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.645
I want to remind you
of something that

36:11.770 --> 36:14.005
an amazing teacher once taught me:

36:14.171 --> 36:17.465
without passion, you can't succeed.

36:18.694 --> 36:19.994
Who taught you that?

36:20.344 --> 36:21.989
You did.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.457
And you do.

36:23.582 --> 36:24.933
When you teach Glee.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.873
I'm telling you,
there's no word but "genius."

36:32.107 --> 36:33.733
I wouldn't call it that.

36:33.899 --> 36:35.360
What's genius?
My plan for Regionals?

36:35.526 --> 36:38.363
No. Your lil'punkin's pamphlets.

36:39.697 --> 36:40.782
"Taint Misbehavin'."

36:40.948 --> 36:41.709
Mm-hmm.

36:41.834 --> 36:43.026
It's all about the importance

36:43.151 --> 36:44.577
of thoroughly washing your jockstrap.

36:44.743 --> 36:46.162
Hey, bub,

36:46.328 --> 36:48.289
MRSA bacteria infection
is no laughing matter.

36:48.455 --> 36:49.415
No matter how much I talked

36:49.675 --> 36:52.710
to my guys about
the steamy lurking dangers,

36:52.876 --> 36:53.753
nobody cared

36:54.012 --> 36:56.005
Until Emma found a way
to get through to them.

36:56.171 --> 36:57.925
Come on, guys!

36:58.050 --> 37:01.095
Why, just last week,
three Fort Wayne gymnasts

37:01.220 --> 37:03.547
had to have their junk amputated!

37:03.672 --> 37:06.183
I stopped washing down there
'cause it seemed kind of gay.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.518
I thought that's what the hair
catching the dirt.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.688
Huh. Lift and scrub.

37:10.813 --> 37:12.146
Who knew it was so easy?

37:12.447 --> 37:14.232
And now their kibbles and bits are

37:14.449 --> 37:15.942
as clean as a little angel's tear.

37:16.108 --> 37:18.061
And when I showed that to my Cooter,

37:18.186 --> 37:21.948
not only did he order
10,000 copies for Ohio State,

37:22.114 --> 37:25.285
he got every team in the Big Ten
to order copies, too.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.495
- Wow, that's...
- It's genius!

37:27.661 --> 37:29.998
I have never met a
teacher whose passion

37:30.164 --> 37:31.833
literally saves lives.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.376
Aren't you proud of her, Will?

37:34.752 --> 37:36.280
Yes.

37:36.405 --> 37:37.338
Absolutely.

37:38.922 --> 37:40.383
Genius! You!

37:40.549 --> 37:41.550
Stop.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.223
{pub}And the award for Best Conjugator
goes to

37:47.389 --> 37:48.393
Señora Stephanie.

37:50.887 --> 37:53.531
Thank you, Señor Martinez.

37:53.656 --> 37:55.734
And thanks to you, Claudia knows now

37:55.859 --> 37:57.935
to go before she comes to work.

37:59.693 --> 38:02.071
Now finally, Most Improved:

38:02.237 --> 38:04.542
Will Schuester.

38:04.667 --> 38:06.044
- Wow.
- Come on, man!

38:06.169 --> 38:07.744
Thanks.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.542
Wow, I...

38:09.667 --> 38:10.455
Oh.

38:10.707 --> 38:11.666
<i>Fue un año maravilloso.</i>

38:11.791 --> 38:12.999
It was a beautiful year, everyone.

38:13.259 --> 38:14.417
<i>Gracias.
Hey, de nada.</i>

38:14.677 --> 38:16.461
<i>Gracias.</i>

38:16.679 --> 38:18.840
Your teeth are like
fresh-driven snow white.

38:18.965 --> 38:20.506
Like Larry Bird white.

38:22.552 --> 38:24.093
Most Improved.

38:24.259 --> 38:27.055
I don't think that's the award
a Spanish teacher wants to get

38:27.221 --> 38:28.466
in Spanish class.

38:28.591 --> 38:31.486
Will, man, you work hard,
you take care of your kids.

38:31.611 --> 38:33.102
They're very lucky to have you, man.

38:33.268 --> 38:34.939
They deserve better.

38:35.064 --> 38:36.147
They deserve you.

38:36.313 --> 38:38.650
Oh, so when do I start?

38:38.816 --> 38:40.568
How about Monday?

38:40.734 --> 38:41.979
I spoke to Figgins.

38:42.104 --> 38:44.315
I had all the kids go in
and talk to him, as well.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.075
They all want to take Spanish
if you're the teacher.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.011
What, he's offering me a job?

38:51.280 --> 38:52.290
Teaching?

38:52.415 --> 38:53.623
During the day?

38:53.789 --> 38:56.350
I hope you're not a vampire.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.461
Oh, man.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.255
Okay.

39:01.421 --> 39:03.883
Oh, man, you don...
you don't understand.

39:04.049 --> 39:05.551
My-My parents,

39:05.717 --> 39:07.439
my parents were immigrants.

39:07.564 --> 39:10.275
And they had to lie
about their citizenship

39:10.400 --> 39:12.227
to go to high school.

39:12.352 --> 39:14.529
And now I'm teaching it.

39:14.654 --> 39:16.187
It's the American Dream, right?

39:16.406 --> 39:17.689
Yeah.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.451
But what about you?

39:19.576 --> 39:22.754
Oh, there's-there's an opening
in the History department.

39:22.879 --> 39:24.278
I've always loved history.

39:24.444 --> 39:26.114
Well, the History Channel, at least.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.533
- Right.
- Maybe I'll find my duende there.

39:28.699 --> 39:31.496
No, I've seen you, I've seen you
teach Glee Club, man.

39:31.621 --> 39:33.830
You have <i>duende</i>
coming out of your <i>orejas</i>.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.416
- Ears.
- Ears, right.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.702
I got you.

39:37.827 --> 39:38.876
Thank you so much.

39:39.042 --> 39:41.372
Thank you.

39:41.497 --> 39:44.507
So, wait a minute, who ended up
getting the tenure position?

39:48.844 --> 39:50.715
Thank you, Becky.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.985
My online pharmacist
has recommended these

39:54.110 --> 39:56.438
fertility injections every day,
twice a day,

39:56.563 --> 39:59.355
until Little Susie
or Little Sylvester catches.

39:59.521 --> 40:00.398
You down with that?

40:00.564 --> 40:01.899
No problem, Coach.

40:04.020 --> 40:05.194
What's wrong?

40:05.360 --> 40:07.488
Coach, I have a confession to make.

40:07.654 --> 40:09.117
Take a seat.

40:09.242 --> 40:10.533
Now, if this is about

40:10.699 --> 40:13.972
the complaint you lodged against
me with Principal Figgins,

40:14.097 --> 40:15.371
I already know.

40:15.537 --> 40:16.456
You do, Coach?

40:16.622 --> 40:17.692
Oh, Becky, I've known

40:17.817 --> 40:19.294
ever since
I tinker-tailor-soldier-spied

40:19.419 --> 40:21.419
my way into Figgins's
file cabinet and read

40:21.585 --> 40:22.462
the evaluation cards.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.681
And when I saw one

40:23.806 --> 40:25.150
written in crayon,
I knew it was either

40:25.275 --> 40:27.425
you or Brittany,
and you're the better speller.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.553
Coach, I'm sorry.

40:28.678 --> 40:30.094
I was just looking out for the team.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.691
Did you mean what you wrote?

40:33.816 --> 40:36.184
That you're worried I'm not
as focused on the Cheerios!

40:36.350 --> 40:37.769
as I used to be?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.397
Well, then you don't need be sorry.

40:39.522 --> 40:41.773
And thank you for the feedback.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.191
You're not mad?

40:43.357 --> 40:44.692
No, Becky.

40:46.195 --> 40:49.822
But impending motherhood
doth given me perspective.

40:49.988 --> 40:53.701
Oh, Becky, I'm reminded
winning,

40:53.867 --> 40:54.994
my girls,

40:55.160 --> 40:56.798
destroying my enemies.

40:56.923 --> 40:58.466
Motherhood's not gonna change that.

40:58.591 --> 41:01.209
If anything, it makes me
want them far more.

41:01.375 --> 41:03.922
You're an excellent
co-captain, Becky.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.713
You're like me.

41:05.879 --> 41:07.509
Not afraid to make the tough calls.

41:07.634 --> 41:08.883
Coach?

41:09.049 --> 41:10.949
You're gonna be a great mom.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.874
There you are, baby.
You ready?

41:39.999 --> 41:41.874
For lunch.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.251
We're going off-campus, right?

41:43.417 --> 41:44.919
Hey, Sam.

42:05.191 --> 42:06.607
What's all this?

42:11.781 --> 42:15.617
"So You Were A Jerk To Your Fiance."

42:17.286 --> 42:20.746
Not particularly clever,
but I appreciate your pith.

42:23.062 --> 42:25.710
"Congratulations... I Love You."

42:25.876 --> 42:27.211
These are wonderful.

42:27.377 --> 42:28.590
They're wonderful.

42:30.166 --> 42:33.217
A little myopic maybe,
but a great first effort.

42:37.056 --> 42:38.431
I'm so proud of you.

42:38.674 --> 42:41.519
So do I call you Professor
or Madam or what?

42:41.644 --> 42:43.237
I'm not sure of the protocol here.

42:43.362 --> 42:44.522
No, no, no, it's just tenure.

42:44.647 --> 42:45.773
You can call me Emma.

42:45.898 --> 42:48.232
Or sweetheart
or cutie pie or doll-face.

42:48.398 --> 42:49.393
- Or Professor Doll-Face.
- Ooh.

42:49.518 --> 42:50.495
I like Professor Doll-Face.

42:54.190 --> 42:56.157
My first marriage didn't
work out because my wife

42:56.323 --> 42:57.366
didn't believe in me.

42:57.532 --> 43:01.287
And then I go and pull
the same crap on you.

43:01.453 --> 43:05.259
All I know is that right now,
in this moment,

43:05.384 --> 43:08.880
I just want it to stop.

43:09.005 --> 43:13.132
I want to sit here, eat
some chicken and look back on

43:13.298 --> 43:15.218
everything you've done
to get to this moment

43:15.384 --> 43:19.256
and everything I'm going to do
from this moment on

43:19.381 --> 43:23.851
to make sure you feel...
as special... and amazing

43:24.017 --> 43:26.655
as I know you are.
