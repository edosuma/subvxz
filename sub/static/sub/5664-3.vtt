11:54.354 --> 11:56.756
Who are you talking about?

11:56.757 --> 12:00.526
He has gone by many names
over the centuries.

12:00.527 --> 12:03.029
You might know him...

12:03.030 --> 12:05.164
as Jack the Ripper.

12:35.359 --> 12:40.328
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

12:40.363 --> 12:42.041
How could Jack the Ripper been around

12:42.042 --> 12:44.990
when you were a kid?
It was almost 100 years

12:44.991 --> 12:46.416
before the Whitechapel murders.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.853
Spring, 1763, to be exact.

12:49.854 --> 12:53.323
During my sixth form at Eton College.

12:53.324 --> 12:57.093
And the innocence of my youth...

12:57.094 --> 13:00.397
came to a very sudden end.

13:00.398 --> 13:02.799
(thunder rumbling)

13:02.800 --> 13:04.234
The Ripper struck again!

13:04.235 --> 13:05.768
Come on, Ichabod, shake a leg!

13:12.009 --> 13:15.145
Don't! You'll not wish to
remember him this way.

13:15.146 --> 13:17.146
Ichabod!

13:20.354 --> 13:22.822
CRANE: Bertie was my closest friend.

13:22.823 --> 13:25.191
Had been since our very first term.

13:25.192 --> 13:26.826
We were to spend that summer together

13:26.827 --> 13:29.262
at his family estate in Berkshire.

13:29.263 --> 13:33.666
My last memory of him is
finding his butchered remains.

13:35.503 --> 13:38.738
Meet us on the commons in 15 minutes.

13:38.739 --> 13:41.407
We're going after whoever did this.

13:51.385 --> 13:54.053
Stephens?

13:54.922 --> 13:56.756
What is all this?

13:56.757 --> 13:58.291
Why are my things packed?

14:00.194 --> 14:02.329
I'm to take you back to
London, Master Ichabod.

14:02.330 --> 14:03.930
No, you can't.

14:03.931 --> 14:06.333
I need to join the others,
help them find...

14:06.334 --> 14:09.335
It is not safe for you here.

14:10.304 --> 14:12.539
My boy, try to understand.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.507
Your first duty is to ensure

14:14.508 --> 14:18.578
the continuation of your family name.

14:18.579 --> 14:20.847
Your semester at Eton is over.

14:20.848 --> 14:23.516
MAN (in distance): Ichabod!

14:26.153 --> 14:28.188
CRANE: <i>I would return to
Eton following autumn</i>

14:28.189 --> 14:29.889
once the dust had settled.

14:29.890 --> 14:32.659
For the rest of my time there,

14:32.660 --> 14:35.762
fear was my constant companion.

14:35.763 --> 14:37.263
'Cause the Ripper was never caught.

14:37.264 --> 14:38.732
It could have been anyone among you.

14:38.733 --> 14:40.734
Oh, we trusted no one.

14:40.735 --> 14:42.902
Not our schoolmasters,
not even each other.

14:42.903 --> 14:44.504
I became

14:44.505 --> 14:47.073
obsessed with solving the Ripper killings.

14:47.074 --> 14:50.377
It was not until this past year...

14:50.378 --> 14:53.213
when I learned of the infamous event

14:53.214 --> 14:56.816
in Whitechapel, London, 1888...

14:56.817 --> 14:59.485
that a far larger pattern took shape.

15:01.355 --> 15:02.756
ABBIE: Similar killings

15:02.757 --> 15:04.858
have taken place, on and
off, for over 900 years,

15:04.859 --> 15:06.926
dating back as far as

15:06.927 --> 15:10.196
William the Conqueror in 1066.

15:10.197 --> 15:12.332
They're all the same killer.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.401
A powerful, supernatural being,

15:14.402 --> 15:17.237
spreading death and fear in its wake.

15:17.238 --> 15:18.605
Summoned by Pandora.

15:18.606 --> 15:20.774
This is no coincidence, Lieutenant.

15:20.775 --> 15:24.244
The killing was an exact match
to what I saw as a boy.

15:25.980 --> 15:27.947
If it's her, that means

15:27.948 --> 15:30.283
that not only does she know who you are,

15:30.284 --> 15:32.619
but somehow has access to
your earliest memories.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.721
- How reassuring.
- Biggest clue that we have

15:34.722 --> 15:37.757
is how that body was exsanguinated.

15:37.758 --> 15:39.993
Something...

15:39.994 --> 15:42.996
almost drained the victim
of nearly half his blood.

15:42.997 --> 15:46.900
Yet we are left with very little
in the way of hard evidence.

15:46.901 --> 15:50.003
In 18th century England, maybe, but today,

15:50.004 --> 15:52.872
with the latest and
greatest in FBI technology,

15:52.873 --> 15:54.974
we can start by identifying
the murder weapon.

16:03.884 --> 16:06.286
Car is cold.

16:06.287 --> 16:08.388
I think Randall's been
posted up here a while.

16:08.389 --> 16:11.024
Good. Means he might
still have the Shard.

16:15.162 --> 16:17.664
Whoa! Stop!

16:17.665 --> 16:19.499
- Please don't shoot.
- Where is Randall?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.668
He's getting ice. Look, whatever

16:21.669 --> 16:24.104
problem you have with this
guy, just leave me out of it.

16:24.105 --> 16:26.172
I'm just hitching a ride out of town!

16:26.173 --> 16:30.076
Picked the wrong guy
to party with, honey.

16:35.850 --> 16:37.684
Damn! Damn, damn, damn!

16:37.685 --> 16:39.485
(tires screeching)

16:51.899 --> 16:53.305
(grunts)

16:53.306 --> 16:56.236
Randall, please tell me this is
one of your sick perversions,

16:56.237 --> 16:59.105
and you did not lose the
Shard to that amateur!

16:59.106 --> 17:00.673
You got played, too, Mills.

17:00.674 --> 17:03.710
I mean, I understand him, but you?

17:04.954 --> 17:07.027
You sure you're related
to August Corbin?

17:07.028 --> 17:09.667
Hey, you know, I'm not the one
handcuffed to a shower railing.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.300
Try my 300 mil lens.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.169
It's hollow.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.674
Damn it, Randall!

17:20.675 --> 17:22.309
Did you at least stop creeping on her

17:22.310 --> 17:23.710
long enough to get a name?

17:23.711 --> 17:25.012
Yeah. But I'm guessing a fake one

17:25.012 --> 17:26.413
like I gave to her.

17:26.414 --> 17:28.882
- (scoffs)
- Hey!

17:28.883 --> 17:30.984
Don't leave me here, man! Come on!

17:30.985 --> 17:33.120
- Whole lost soul, hitchhiker thing.
- RANDALL: Hey! Come on!

17:33.121 --> 17:34.554
Straight out of your dad's playbook.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.256
Wait. Sorry, what are you talking about?

17:36.257 --> 17:37.924
How's that girl connected to my dad?

17:37.925 --> 17:41.428
I don't know yet, but
if she wants to play...

17:49.203 --> 17:51.304
(crying softly)

17:59.580 --> 18:01.515
ABBIE: We need to find commonality

18:01.516 --> 18:03.817
and I.D. this guy before
he strikes again.

18:03.818 --> 18:06.620
Using the specs from the victim's wounds

18:06.621 --> 18:08.288
and the angles of attack,

18:08.289 --> 18:11.858
forensics was able to
reconstruct the murder weapon.

18:11.859 --> 18:14.194
It's not exactly a straight razor.

18:14.195 --> 18:16.730
It's somehow familiar.

18:16.731 --> 18:20.033
First Crusades.

18:20.034 --> 18:23.303
That is a Byzantine parang,

18:23.304 --> 18:25.505
or long-bladed dagger.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.476
Here.

18:29.477 --> 18:32.379
Forged by ironsmiths for

18:32.380 --> 18:36.249
Iftikhar Al-Dawla, Governor
of Jerusalem, in 958 A.D.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.519
That is a whole lot of knife,
even for Sleepy Hollow.

18:40.988 --> 18:43.757
Legend says that those
who wield the dagger

18:43.758 --> 18:47.027
"shall shed all virtue
and be wholly overcome

18:47.028 --> 18:48.628
"with an unquenchable

18:48.629 --> 18:50.097
bloodlust."

18:50.098 --> 18:51.665
"Wholly overcome."

18:51.666 --> 18:53.967
The knife.

18:55.503 --> 18:57.337
It turns people into Rippers.

18:58.706 --> 19:01.408
We're not searching for a monster.

19:01.409 --> 19:04.277
We're searching for a weapon.

19:10.485 --> 19:13.119
(sighs)

19:30.338 --> 19:32.172
So beautiful.

19:32.173 --> 19:34.007
You.

19:34.008 --> 19:36.343
Please.

19:36.344 --> 19:38.712
Just leave me alone.

19:38.713 --> 19:41.548
I know you don't mean that.

19:41.549 --> 19:43.950
Now that you've had a taste...

19:43.951 --> 19:46.887
of that thing buried deep inside you.

19:46.888 --> 19:48.188
(grunting)

19:53.928 --> 19:55.261
You feel it?

19:56.397 --> 19:58.431
No.

20:01.235 --> 20:03.203
I don't want it anymore.

20:04.372 --> 20:06.072
(grunts)

20:06.073 --> 20:07.541
Stop it.

20:07.542 --> 20:09.576
Wh-What's happening to me?

20:09.577 --> 20:12.445
Just one more little step.

20:12.446 --> 20:13.713
(gasping)

20:13.714 --> 20:15.549
(groaning)

20:15.550 --> 20:18.818
(screaming)

20:22.089 --> 20:24.492
(screaming)

20:29.540 --> 20:30.562
There you are.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.094
I'm just coming to see
you with your update.

20:32.095 --> 20:33.505
Based on what I'm sensing so far,

20:33.506 --> 20:35.364
we're dealing with a ritualistic killing.

20:35.365 --> 20:37.814
The UnSub is targeting specific victims.

20:37.815 --> 20:39.448
I'm still working out the pattern.

20:39.449 --> 20:42.284
I would like to stay on it
for now, but that is your call.

20:42.285 --> 20:44.386
Stay on it. Run it through ViCAP.

20:44.387 --> 20:46.889
Just download me on it later.

20:46.890 --> 20:47.690
Say over dinner?

20:47.691 --> 20:49.658
Dinner?

20:49.659 --> 20:53.062
You know, the meal at the end of the day.

20:53.063 --> 20:53.813
Okay.

20:53.814 --> 20:55.998
No big deal. I just think
it'd be a good idea

20:55.999 --> 20:58.334
if we clear the air about a few things.

20:58.335 --> 21:00.302
Tonight?

21:00.303 --> 21:01.870
Tonight works.

21:01.871 --> 21:04.707
Good. Then carry on, Agent Mills.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.308
Agent Reynolds.

21:09.112 --> 21:11.046
That one.

21:11.047 --> 21:13.682
That.

21:15.485 --> 21:18.020
That one.

21:22.192 --> 21:23.859
- (gasps): Oh.
- Oh.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.728
- Mr. Crane.
- Miss Corinth.

21:25.729 --> 21:27.930
(laughs) Uh, this is a surprise.

21:27.931 --> 21:29.698
What brings you to...?

21:29.699 --> 21:33.102
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

21:33.103 --> 21:36.238
The city has rejected
my application again.

21:36.239 --> 21:38.874
- This will not stand.
- Oh. No, no, it's not about that.

21:38.875 --> 21:41.410
It's what you said afterwards.

21:41.411 --> 21:44.446
How everyone should have a
chance to build a life here.

21:44.447 --> 21:48.083
I wanted to tell you...
it really spoke to me.

21:48.084 --> 21:51.286
It took my dad more than a decade

21:51.287 --> 21:54.757
and his entire savings
to become a citizen.

21:54.758 --> 21:56.859
When he finally took
the oath of citizenship,

21:56.860 --> 21:59.595
it was one of the proudest
moments in his life.

21:59.596 --> 22:02.598
It is an oath I intend to take very soon.

22:02.599 --> 22:06.568
Look, I'm not a lawyer,
but if you'll let me,

22:06.569 --> 22:09.004
I'd like to help you become an American.

22:09.005 --> 22:11.774
Ms. Corinth, that is most kind of you,

22:11.775 --> 22:14.877
but I could not possibly
impose on your generosity.

22:14.878 --> 22:16.245
My brother-in-law is a member

22:16.246 --> 22:18.080
of the Senate subcommittee
on immigration.

22:18.081 --> 22:22.017
I would be honored to
accept your assistance.

22:22.018 --> 22:23.285
(chuckles)

22:23.286 --> 22:24.553
I'll call you?

22:24.554 --> 22:27.456
I look forward to it.

22:39.502 --> 22:41.904
Oh, please.

22:41.905 --> 22:44.106
As if Adams would have
done any different.

22:50.113 --> 22:53.782
PANDORA: This was not a random choice.

22:53.783 --> 22:56.452
The knife senses only the deepest pain,

22:56.453 --> 23:00.756
seeks it out and channels it like a forge,

23:00.757 --> 23:05.727
out of which you emerge reborn,
as you were meant to be.

23:05.728 --> 23:08.330
Oh, the moment I saw

23:08.331 --> 23:12.134
your wounded and fragile heart,

23:12.135 --> 23:17.072
I knew that you could
become what everyone fears.

23:17.073 --> 23:20.476
The unseen rising up amongst us.

23:20.477 --> 23:24.446
Slowly destroying the illusion

23:24.447 --> 23:27.015
of sanctuary from darkness.

23:27.016 --> 23:29.451
And now that you've tasted it...

23:29.452 --> 23:31.487
that intoxicating feeling...

23:31.488 --> 23:35.791
you can join an ancient
and grand history.

23:35.792 --> 23:36.825
(thunder cracks)

23:36.826 --> 23:38.994
You can stand by my side

23:38.995 --> 23:41.196
and be revered by all,

23:41.197 --> 23:44.967
but only if you abandon all hesitation,

23:44.968 --> 23:47.536
mercy and doubt.

23:47.537 --> 23:50.739
The two Witnesses will seek to stop you.

23:50.740 --> 23:53.408
Bury your new power
deep into their hearts

23:53.409 --> 23:55.410
and bring me back what I desire:

23:55.411 --> 23:58.747
a destiny that favors the strong

23:58.748 --> 24:01.016
and destroys the weak.

24:04.154 --> 24:08.323
You're certain this Nelson
Meyers is the man we seek?

24:08.324 --> 24:11.960
Profile points to a white
male, mid-20s, loner type.

24:11.961 --> 24:13.629
Someone who had access to the building

24:13.630 --> 24:16.131
that the victim was killed in;
and Nelson's the only one

24:16.132 --> 24:17.799
who didn't show up for work today.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.701
How does turning this man into a murderer

24:19.702 --> 24:21.670
further Pandora's agenda?

24:21.671 --> 24:23.071
Everything she's thrown at us has

24:23.072 --> 24:24.406
some kind of personal connection.

24:24.407 --> 24:27.142
She knows our past, our secrets.

24:27.143 --> 24:30.212
There's definitely a pattern;
just haven't figured it out yet.

24:30.213 --> 24:32.581
Is it too much to ask that
the second tribulation

24:32.582 --> 24:34.416
be easier than the first?

24:39.322 --> 24:42.224
Nelson?

24:44.260 --> 24:46.395
I would tell you

24:46.396 --> 24:48.964
to drop your weapon, but I see
that's not really an option.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.435
CRANE: My God.

24:53.436 --> 24:54.803
Like it?

24:54.804 --> 24:58.207
That blade is manipulating
you, Mr. Meyers.

24:58.208 --> 25:00.008
Anything you may have done

25:00.009 --> 25:02.578
under its influence can end here.

25:02.579 --> 25:04.046
Let us help you.

25:04.047 --> 25:06.548
Help me?

25:07.350 --> 25:08.784
(laughs)

25:10.186 --> 25:13.188
Go back to the guy I was before...

25:13.189 --> 25:14.923
invisible?

25:14.924 --> 25:17.125
A joke?

25:18.094 --> 25:20.262
Nelson, you need to calm down.

25:22.599 --> 25:24.566
This is your last chance.

25:24.567 --> 25:26.435
I don't want to hurt you.

25:26.436 --> 25:28.336
But I want to hurt you.

25:37.413 --> 25:38.947
Damn.

25:43.886 --> 25:45.620
Oh, damn.

25:48.825 --> 25:51.693
(laughs)

26:05.478 --> 26:06.845
Thanks, Sammy.

26:06.846 --> 26:08.380
JENNY: Should've tried
the Reuben instead.

26:08.381 --> 26:10.582
It's the best in the state.

26:13.086 --> 26:15.420
I have always loved this place.

26:15.421 --> 26:18.390
It's quiet, out of the way.

26:18.391 --> 26:20.325
From those tables over there,

26:20.326 --> 26:23.061
you can see anyone coming a long way off.

26:23.062 --> 26:25.097
Which is why you never
sit at the counter.

26:25.098 --> 26:26.965
Mm.

26:27.801 --> 26:29.535
Keep your hands where I can see them.

26:29.536 --> 26:31.970
This is just a conversation.

26:31.971 --> 26:34.106
I already sold the Shard.

26:35.909 --> 26:37.609
This Shard?

26:39.712 --> 26:42.548
Hidden compartment in your car battery.

26:42.549 --> 26:45.584
Where have I seen that trick before?

26:45.585 --> 26:47.419
Oh, right.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.988
August Corbin taught it to me.

26:49.989 --> 26:51.623
Never heard of him.

26:51.624 --> 26:53.625
You're new to this; I get that.

26:53.626 --> 26:56.428
Want to make a name for yourself fast.

26:56.429 --> 26:58.597
So you stole the Shard from Randall.

26:58.598 --> 27:00.799
The real question is:

27:00.800 --> 27:03.101
who were you going to sell it to?

27:03.970 --> 27:05.237
You know,

27:05.238 --> 27:06.538
the way I played

27:06.539 --> 27:07.639
you and your boy

27:07.640 --> 27:09.608
at that motel, looks to me

27:09.609 --> 27:11.843
like you've been out of the
game a little too long.

27:13.213 --> 27:17.115
You really don't want
to know who I work for.

27:17.116 --> 27:20.219
Or why that thing is so important.

27:20.220 --> 27:22.921
So just hand it over to me now, hmm?

27:22.922 --> 27:24.356
(chuckles softly)

27:26.292 --> 27:29.595
How'd you get into this, huh?

27:29.596 --> 27:32.164
Did you run away from home?

27:32.165 --> 27:33.999
Do some time in juvie?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.834
(chuckles)

27:35.835 --> 27:38.136
There are a hundred other
ways to make a buck.

27:38.137 --> 27:40.606
This life sure as hell isn't easy.

27:40.607 --> 27:43.976
Maybe that's what I like about it.

27:43.977 --> 27:47.279
Tell your employer the Shard is mine.

27:47.280 --> 27:50.449
A man I consider to be a father
left it in my protection,

27:50.450 --> 27:54.152
and if you come after it
again, things will get ugly.

27:54.153 --> 27:56.722
I guess we'll see how that plays out.

27:56.723 --> 27:58.623
I guess we will.

28:11.437 --> 28:13.442
Whilst your Federal
Bureau is well-equipped

28:13.443 --> 28:16.708
to aid us in tracking Mr. Meyers,

28:16.709 --> 28:19.111
once captured, we have no
idea how to undo the effects

28:19.112 --> 28:20.545
- of that blade.
- Yeah.

28:20.546 --> 28:23.782
I had the same thought,
so I went back to this.

28:23.783 --> 28:27.052
The timeline for the Ripper
killings throughout history.

28:27.053 --> 28:29.821
Pattern is the same: the knife
finds its way into the hands

28:29.822 --> 28:32.557
of some innocent person,
it messes with their mind,

28:32.558 --> 28:33.892
turns them into a brutal killer.

28:33.893 --> 28:37.829
Happens on and off for over 900 years.

28:37.830 --> 28:40.766
How does the "off" part happen?

28:40.767 --> 28:43.101
The killings simply end.

28:43.102 --> 28:45.337
But in each case, the
killer is never caught.

28:45.338 --> 28:47.739
Something stops them.

28:47.740 --> 28:50.075
Have you access to parish records

28:50.076 --> 28:52.544
in England in the mid-1700s?

28:52.545 --> 28:55.113
Specifically Eton and Berkshire.

28:55.114 --> 28:58.150
ABBIE: BMD index...
birth, marriages, death...

28:58.151 --> 28:59.451
1750 onwards.

28:59.452 --> 29:01.887
Here. 1763.

29:01.888 --> 29:04.957
Five murders documented
over six fortnights.

29:04.958 --> 29:07.893
Including Bertram Willoughby, age 14.

29:07.894 --> 29:09.928
Your friend.

29:09.929 --> 29:12.230
No evidence of the killer was ever found,

29:12.231 --> 29:15.233
and the last murder
was June of that year.

29:15.234 --> 29:17.869
The last murder.

29:17.870 --> 29:19.404
Not the last death.

29:19.405 --> 29:22.174
Look. Burial records show that

29:22.175 --> 29:25.410
29 souls were lost in
that spring and summer.

29:25.411 --> 29:26.912
All taken by...

29:26.913 --> 29:28.680
Yellow fever.

29:28.681 --> 29:32.384
All of them students at Eton College.

29:32.385 --> 29:33.952
CRANE: I was not summoned home

29:33.953 --> 29:35.354
because of the Ripper killings.

29:35.355 --> 29:37.589
It was to protect me from infection.

29:37.590 --> 29:39.358
You had no idea about the outbreak?

29:39.359 --> 29:41.126
No, none of us did.

29:41.127 --> 29:44.463
The Crown likely hid the
truth to avoid panic.

29:44.464 --> 29:46.465
My father must have learned of it

29:46.466 --> 29:48.300
by his connections in parliament

29:48.301 --> 29:50.002
and sent Stephens to retrieve me.

29:50.003 --> 29:51.436
It all tracks.

29:51.437 --> 29:53.238
The end of every killing spree coincides

29:53.239 --> 29:54.906
with an outbreak of disease.

29:54.907 --> 29:58.810
Yellow fever, cholera, malaria,

29:58.811 --> 30:00.012
Spanish flu.

30:00.013 --> 30:02.280
Exsanguinated bodies.

30:04.517 --> 30:07.019
(thunder crashes)

30:07.020 --> 30:09.488
The knife gains power
by draining the blood

30:09.489 --> 30:10.289
of its victims.

30:10.290 --> 30:12.624
And when it drains someone
with a disease...

30:12.625 --> 30:15.293
Its food source is tarnished.
It cannot survive.

30:15.294 --> 30:16.628
We need blood.

30:19.198 --> 30:22.034
(knocking on glass) Agent Mills.

30:22.035 --> 30:24.236
You need to see this.

30:24.237 --> 30:26.338
It's forensics on Nelson
Meyers' computer.

30:26.339 --> 30:28.875
I managed to access the encrypted
files on his hard drive.

30:28.876 --> 30:29.808
ABBIE: I recognize her

30:29.809 --> 30:31.510
from the personnel files.

30:31.511 --> 30:34.012
Emily Kates. She worked on
the same floor as Meyers.

30:34.013 --> 30:36.715
Obviously the object of
his twisted affection.

30:36.716 --> 30:38.250
ABBIE: And his next victim.

30:38.251 --> 30:40.452
We need to move.

31:05.161 --> 31:07.704
Ms. Kates, we need you to come with us.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.467
Message from Detective Chandler.

31:14.468 --> 31:16.870
As requested, Miss Kates is
safely under his protection.

31:16.871 --> 31:18.338
Good.

31:18.339 --> 31:19.706
Text him back, ask him

31:19.707 --> 31:21.341
if there's any sign of trouble.

31:21.342 --> 31:22.442
We need to know where Nelson is.

31:22.443 --> 31:24.077
We start by eliminating

31:24.078 --> 31:25.912
the places he isn't.

31:25.913 --> 31:27.947
Sending.

31:29.617 --> 31:31.551
As we have a limited
supply of tainted blood,

31:31.552 --> 31:33.386
I have but two chances

31:33.387 --> 31:36.056
to stop the Ripper.

31:36.057 --> 31:39.859
Assuming I have time to reload.

31:39.860 --> 31:41.928
I thought you were supposed
to be hot stuff with a musket.

31:41.929 --> 31:43.296
I was always a little better

31:43.297 --> 31:45.065
with a flintlock pistol
than a Brown Bess.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.901
But I promise you...

31:47.902 --> 31:50.103
I shall not miss.

31:51.639 --> 31:54.374
It would seem you and I have
even more in common, Lieutenant.

31:55.576 --> 31:58.578
We both witnessed evil at a young age.

31:58.579 --> 32:00.213
Even as a boy, I was destined

32:00.214 --> 32:02.549
to cross paths with dark forces...

32:02.550 --> 32:04.250
(thunder crashing)

32:04.251 --> 32:08.121
...and to lose those
for whom I most care.

32:09.457 --> 32:11.458
I will avenge every life

32:11.459 --> 32:13.793
that blade has taken.

32:13.794 --> 32:14.928
Anything from Rudi?

32:14.929 --> 32:16.930
No.

32:16.931 --> 32:18.231
Call him.

32:18.232 --> 32:20.033
(speed-dial keys beeping)

32:20.034 --> 32:21.754
RUDI: Hi, you've reached
Detective Rudi Chandler

32:21.755 --> 32:23.870
- of the Sleepy Hollow Police Department.
- Something's wrong.

32:23.871 --> 32:24.938
Please leave a message.

32:24.939 --> 32:26.906
Hold on.

32:50.598 --> 32:52.065
Rudi?

32:54.702 --> 32:57.103
Oh...

33:01.342 --> 33:03.710
There's no sign of Emily.

33:04.779 --> 33:07.313
Or Mr. Meyers.

33:07.314 --> 33:08.948
- (beeping) _
- Well, we need to seal up

33:08.949 --> 33:10.450
this place before he gets too far.

33:10.451 --> 33:13.453
Two more kills. The knife has fed again.

33:13.454 --> 33:15.121
He'll be more powerful than before.

33:15.122 --> 33:17.424
(Emily screams)

33:17.425 --> 33:20.026
Get the rifle.

33:24.298 --> 33:26.633
- Nelson?
- (Emily screams)

33:28.869 --> 33:30.536
Don't make this worse!

33:31.372 --> 33:34.073
(Emily cries out)

33:38.546 --> 33:40.547
NELSON: You're interrupting us.

33:40.548 --> 33:42.515
Release her!

33:42.516 --> 33:43.750
Nelson, please...

33:43.751 --> 33:45.551
Shut up!

33:47.087 --> 33:50.590
How will harming her make
you any less of an outcast?

33:50.591 --> 33:52.192
Huh?

33:52.193 --> 33:53.493
You need to back off.

33:53.494 --> 33:55.128
Fight what

33:55.129 --> 33:57.297
that weapon is doing to your mind.

33:57.298 --> 33:59.632
Before it completely consumes you.

34:10.077 --> 34:11.511
(grunting)

34:11.512 --> 34:15.514
Nelson, we know you felt ignored.

34:15.516 --> 34:19.252
But you need to know
that we can save you.

34:19.253 --> 34:21.353
I am saved.

34:21.355 --> 34:22.355
(grunts)

34:22.356 --> 34:23.590
They used to laugh at me.

34:23.591 --> 34:26.359
Think they'll laugh at me now?

34:35.536 --> 34:38.071
How cool is that?

34:38.072 --> 34:40.440
Go. Lieutenant, protect Miss Emily.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.275
Go! Go!

34:42.275 --> 34:43.842
(grunts)

34:44.777 --> 34:46.713
(low snarl)

34:46.714 --> 34:48.313
(bullets ricochet)

34:53.219 --> 34:55.888
(grunting)

35:01.562 --> 35:04.230
(grunting)

35:08.602 --> 35:11.370
(grunting)

35:19.713 --> 35:21.648
(groans)

35:21.649 --> 35:24.817
(grunting)

35:28.489 --> 35:29.655
(grunts)

35:32.793 --> 35:34.944
(grunting)

35:43.254 --> 35:45.121
♪

35:52.430 --> 35:53.930
(coughs)

35:53.931 --> 35:55.932
(pants)

35:57.913 --> 35:59.213
What did you do?

36:01.316 --> 36:04.151
(Nelson screams)

36:04.152 --> 36:05.819
Ended this.

36:05.820 --> 36:06.987
(coughs)

36:10.992 --> 36:13.527
Oh, no.

36:13.528 --> 36:15.696
Crane.

36:15.697 --> 36:16.697
(panting)

36:16.698 --> 36:18.465
Oh, my God.

36:18.466 --> 36:20.701
All right. An ambulance is on the way.

36:20.702 --> 36:22.369
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:22.370 --> 36:24.471
Stay with me. Stay with me, okay?

36:24.472 --> 36:27.374
Crane. Crane.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.643
PANDORA: Tell me.

36:29.644 --> 36:30.878
How does that feel?

36:30.879 --> 36:32.880
(shuddering breaths)

36:32.881 --> 36:36.016
To know that his life is
slipping through your fingers.

36:36.017 --> 36:38.319
- (moaning)
- To know that you're alone now,

36:38.320 --> 36:41.388
alone in this fight of yours,

36:41.389 --> 36:45.359
alone in this world.

36:51.099 --> 36:54.301
Stay with me, okay?

37:00.475 --> 37:02.843
Pictures.

37:02.844 --> 37:05.379
Mementos from the war.

37:06.381 --> 37:07.915
(sighs) Everything else,

37:07.916 --> 37:10.718
he already gave to you and
Abbie or it got tossed.

37:10.719 --> 37:12.379
No, there's nothing in
here that might explain

37:12.380 --> 37:14.054
why the Shard's so important or who else

37:14.055 --> 37:15.556
might be involved.

37:15.557 --> 37:18.000
I was the one your dad
trusted with everything.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.594
At least, I thought so.

37:20.595 --> 37:23.897
For all you know, she was just
another hired gun, like Randall.

37:23.898 --> 37:25.566
With my moves?

37:25.567 --> 37:28.569
Trading in the same circles I used to?

37:28.570 --> 37:30.571
Hey, we got the Shard back.

37:30.572 --> 37:32.439
A win's a win, right?

37:33.441 --> 37:34.742
Look, the girl had some game,

37:34.743 --> 37:35.976
but that doesn't mean that

37:35.977 --> 37:36.977
she worked for my dad

37:36.978 --> 37:38.245
or even knew the man.

37:39.547 --> 37:42.249
Your dad's life was a maze of secrets.

37:43.485 --> 37:45.552
I feel like we just
stumbled on a big one.

37:45.553 --> 37:47.955
Yeah, well, I'm getting
pretty used to that.

37:47.956 --> 37:49.823
(chuckles)

37:49.824 --> 37:50.958
Look...

37:52.060 --> 37:55.262
...I asked you to show
me this world, so...

37:55.263 --> 37:58.932
wherever that leads
and whatever we learn,

37:58.933 --> 38:00.834
I'm with you.

38:03.271 --> 38:04.772
You think I'm gonna quit now,

38:04.773 --> 38:06.740
when it's just getting interesting?

38:10.979 --> 38:13.174
More people are gonna come
after this thing, Joe.

38:13.175 --> 38:16.917
We got to get ahead of that
by figuring out who they are.

38:16.918 --> 38:19.486
Starting with her.

38:24.726 --> 38:25.793
(knocking)

38:25.794 --> 38:27.761
I need a rain check on dinner.

38:27.762 --> 38:29.797
After the day you had, I don't doubt it.

38:29.798 --> 38:31.332
Congrats on helping the local PD

38:31.333 --> 38:32.800
get their man.

38:32.801 --> 38:35.602
Sounds like he was a Grade A lunatic.

38:35.603 --> 38:38.505
He'll be in Tarrytown
Psych for a long time.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.175
(mouths): One.

38:46.648 --> 38:48.982
Here's the thing:

38:48.983 --> 38:50.718
at the academy,

38:50.719 --> 38:53.654
we helped push each other,
made each other better.

38:53.655 --> 38:56.724
I'd like to try to find a way to
keep that working for the both

38:56.725 --> 38:58.525
of us.

39:01.896 --> 39:04.865
Now, that worked then
because we were equals.

39:04.866 --> 39:06.133
Now...

39:06.134 --> 39:07.768
you're the boss.

39:07.769 --> 39:09.837
You're on a different
track than I am, Danny.

39:09.838 --> 39:11.700
Just a few years ahead
of you, that's all.

39:11.701 --> 39:12.940
We both know you're just

39:12.941 --> 39:14.641
as good an agent as I am.

39:16.678 --> 39:18.112
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

39:18.113 --> 39:19.513
we keep working off each other,

39:19.514 --> 39:21.148
have each other's backs,

39:21.149 --> 39:23.183
we can do a lot of damage.

39:24.819 --> 39:27.688
What happened between us
doesn't have to get in the way.

39:35.296 --> 39:37.197
Glad you said something

39:37.198 --> 39:39.266
'cause it was on my mind, too.

39:42.103 --> 39:44.071
Thanks for the drink.

39:44.072 --> 39:45.906
Anytime.

39:49.344 --> 39:51.945
(door opens)

39:57.051 --> 40:00.253
(moans softly)

40:06.528 --> 40:09.129
(panting softly)

40:12.167 --> 40:14.968
(weakly): Lieutenant?

40:14.969 --> 40:17.237
They got you on some powerful
stuff, so take it easy.

40:17.238 --> 40:18.672
(moans softly)

40:18.673 --> 40:20.674
Of all the damn stunts,

40:20.675 --> 40:22.843
injecting yourself with malaria?

40:22.844 --> 40:24.311
(chuckles softly)

40:24.312 --> 40:27.181
For your information,

40:27.182 --> 40:29.616
malaria was the Patriots' greatest ally

40:29.617 --> 40:31.151
during the Siege of Charleston.

40:31.152 --> 40:33.353
We had grown

40:33.354 --> 40:36.356
resistance to the disease,

40:36.357 --> 40:41.195
whilst the British recruits
fell ill by the hundreds.

40:41.196 --> 40:42.963
(chuckles)

40:46.000 --> 40:48.702
After you passed out, she showed up.

40:48.703 --> 40:51.071
Pandora?

40:51.072 --> 40:53.507
(grunts) Did she harm you?

40:53.508 --> 40:56.276
Mm-mm. No. More like tried to scare me.

40:56.277 --> 40:59.646
Apparently I made her list
of people to mess with, too.

40:59.647 --> 41:02.015
And I still don't have a
clue why she did all this.

41:03.518 --> 41:05.853
To the Greeks,

41:05.854 --> 41:08.789
Pandora was...

41:08.790 --> 41:12.826
"she who sends up gifts
from beneath the Earth,

41:12.827 --> 41:17.531
that mortals may learn
to fear their gods."

41:17.532 --> 41:21.001
Is it not possible that
these gifts are designed

41:21.002 --> 41:24.371
not just to bring chaos
to Sleepy Hollow...

41:24.372 --> 41:26.807
But to raise fear.

41:26.808 --> 41:28.575
For what reason?

41:28.576 --> 41:31.411
And how does she gain from that?

41:34.215 --> 41:36.416
I have no idea.

41:36.417 --> 41:37.818
But I am certain

41:37.819 --> 41:40.587
we shall uncover her plot

41:40.588 --> 41:42.856
and we shall foil it.

41:42.857 --> 41:44.858
We are, after all,

41:44.859 --> 41:46.960
the Witnesses.

41:49.731 --> 41:52.065
(mimics explosion sound quietly)

41:55.203 --> 41:58.205
I am most grateful, Lieutenant,

41:58.206 --> 42:01.341
that you and I have found one another...

42:02.810 --> 42:06.546
...once again.

42:29.971 --> 42:32.439
(chuckles)

42:32.440 --> 42:35.442
Perfect.
