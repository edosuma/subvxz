WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.690
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.719 --> 00:05.419
I will use these ingredients
to create a killing ground.

00:05.449 --> 00:06.892
Our sister wants to use Hope

00:06.922 --> 00:08.361
to lure Dahlia into a trap.

00:08.391 --> 00:09.525
If we can find a way to replicate

00:09.555 --> 00:11.197
the baby's power source, transferring it

00:11.227 --> 00:12.848
into the doll, that's our decoy.

00:12.878 --> 00:15.401
No powerful witch is
gonna be fooled by a doll.

00:15.431 --> 00:16.650
They need a heartbeat.

00:17.777 --> 00:18.777
Ah!

00:19.674 --> 00:21.018
What did you do to me?

00:21.048 --> 00:22.886
Hope's blood is now in
you. You are now the bait.

00:22.888 --> 00:25.967
And this body is still linked
to Davina and those children.

00:25.997 --> 00:27.341
If I leave it and it dies,

00:27.343 --> 00:28.809
then Davina and the others die with it.

00:28.839 --> 00:32.381
You helped Hayley escape with my daughter.

00:32.412 --> 00:35.115
Rrgh! Agh...

00:36.901 --> 00:37.955
Get out of my head.

00:37.985 --> 00:39.985
I'm not in your head. You're in mine.

00:40.015 --> 00:42.849
If you have a deal to
propose, then undagger me.

00:42.851 --> 00:44.718
You will get to raise your daughter,

00:44.720 --> 00:47.493
and I will channel the magic
that's been promised to me.

00:49.010 --> 00:51.219
Hayley is attempting to flee.

00:51.249 --> 00:53.860
Don't worry. She won't get far tonight.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.072 --> 01:06.573
All right, then.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.700
Simple bit of witchy business.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.820
How difficult can it be?

01:11.499 --> 01:13.201
Remember, the hard part
was Eva linking herself

01:13.231 --> 01:14.669
to the kids, and now it's your body.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.099
Just got to do the unlinking yourself.

01:17.497 --> 01:20.475
Read what I wrote,
abracadabra, the link's severed.

01:20.505 --> 01:22.605
Lovely. Here's hoping I don't

01:22.607 --> 01:25.007
turn us all into a horde of bullfrogs.

01:41.392 --> 01:44.093
Ha ha ha!

01:44.095 --> 01:46.488
Ha ha ha!

01:46.518 --> 01:49.177
Ha ha ha! Come on.

01:56.940 --> 01:59.375
Ha ha ha!

01:59.377 --> 02:01.877
- Oh.
- Good evening.

02:01.879 --> 02:03.279
I wonder if you could help me.

02:03.281 --> 02:05.448
I'm feeling a bit famished.

02:05.450 --> 02:08.451
I'm sorry. I... I don't have any change.

02:08.453 --> 02:11.356
Well, that's no problem, mate.

02:13.591 --> 02:14.403
I'll just help myself.

02:14.433 --> 02:15.958
- Aah!
- Uh!

02:15.960 --> 02:19.228
Sei pour sae kie sei mare noock virgam.

02:19.230 --> 02:22.865
Sei pour sae kie sei mare noock virgam.

02:22.867 --> 02:23.642
Almost there. Keep going.

02:23.672 --> 02:27.433
Sei pour sae kie sei mare noock virgam.

02:30.908 --> 02:32.241
Is it finished?

02:32.243 --> 02:34.143
Only one way to find out.

02:49.626 --> 02:50.692
Heh heh.

02:50.694 --> 02:52.761
Waah...

02:54.955 --> 02:56.185
You must be hungry,

02:56.215 --> 02:58.133
considering what you've endured.

02:58.316 --> 03:00.636
I've never been daggered.

03:00.781 --> 03:04.473
Never knew it was such
an agonizing experience.

03:04.635 --> 03:08.010
It does help explain why
my siblings loathe me.

03:08.197 --> 03:09.778
You need your strength for what's to come.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.147
I suggest you replenish yourself

03:12.149 --> 03:15.254
before the storm.

03:21.176 --> 03:26.027
Med disee secat ad scalpere benet.

03:26.029 --> 03:27.123
It's done.

03:27.153 --> 03:28.670
I'm delinked from those children.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.560
The covens are most grateful,

03:30.590 --> 03:31.672
and we even beat the rain.

03:31.702 --> 03:33.273
I trust Davina will play her part.

03:33.303 --> 03:34.794
Yeah, against my better judgment.

03:34.824 --> 03:36.772
Stop being so overprotective.

03:36.774 --> 03:38.428
If Davina's made regent to all 9 covens,

03:38.458 --> 03:40.313
she'll be granted the
power to resurrect Kol

03:40.343 --> 03:42.379
and the political clout to
connect the witches to our cause.

03:42.409 --> 03:44.279
Don't pop the champagne just yet.

03:44.281 --> 03:45.747
Dahlia said she'd come for the baby,

03:45.749 --> 03:48.043
and now a storm Springs up out of nowhere.

03:48.073 --> 03:49.259
You really think that's a coincidence?

03:49.289 --> 03:51.853
Regardless of her power,
she needs to be dealt with.

03:51.855 --> 03:53.332
Fortunately,

03:54.441 --> 03:56.040
we have a weapon.

03:56.042 --> 03:57.042
Look. No offense,

03:57.072 --> 03:58.643
but are we really gonna put all our eggs

03:58.645 --> 04:00.667
into one still kind of mysterious basket.

04:00.697 --> 04:03.064
I assure you I am quite motivated

04:03.066 --> 04:05.166
to aid in Dahlia's defeat,

04:05.168 --> 04:06.901
particularly now that Elijah has

04:06.903 --> 04:08.536
forced me to be the bait.

04:08.538 --> 04:10.035
And if we should fail,
Davina and the witches

04:10.065 --> 04:11.311
will take up the task,

04:11.341 --> 04:12.558
at the very least distracting Dahlia

04:12.588 --> 04:14.912
long enough for Hope
and Hayley to disappear.

04:21.353 --> 04:22.820
Elijah!

04:27.759 --> 04:30.215
Oh, no.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.906
Where the hell is he?

04:41.173 --> 04:43.040
Have you had your fill?

04:43.042 --> 04:44.423
Indeed.

04:44.948 --> 04:47.945
I'm beginning to feel
like my old self again.

04:50.051 --> 04:53.983
= synced and corrected by Shahrazade = 
... www.addic7ed.com ...

05:14.706 --> 05:18.476
- How's that little one?
- Sleeping rather the storm.

05:18.506 --> 05:20.987
Mary, I appreciate you coming,

05:21.017 --> 05:23.433
but you should know what
you're going up against.

05:23.479 --> 05:26.125
Ancient witch wants to
steal my granddaughter?

05:26.155 --> 05:27.966
Not on my watch.

05:27.996 --> 05:30.227
I brought you something
might come in handy.

05:30.257 --> 05:33.224
In my youth, wolves
and witches had a peace.

05:33.565 --> 05:35.598
Voodoo queen I knew showed me

05:35.628 --> 05:38.857
how to use herbs to
tell when magic's afoot.

05:38.887 --> 05:42.188
Combine Solomon Seal and Snapdragon

05:42.218 --> 05:43.584
and burn them.

05:48.851 --> 05:51.291
If the smoke is white, all's clear.

05:51.293 --> 05:52.526
If it's black,

05:52.528 --> 05:53.766
there's a hex in the air,

05:53.796 --> 05:55.020
and if it's red,

05:55.050 --> 05:57.197
well, then you know you're in trouble.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.823
Just what I thought.

06:01.853 --> 06:03.920
This storm ain't natural.

06:03.922 --> 06:05.357
It's Dahlia.

06:05.685 --> 06:08.325
She's trying to pin us down.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.227
The road to the highway's flooded.

06:10.257 --> 06:12.396
Quickest way out of here's
on foot through back roads.

06:12.802 --> 06:14.398
What's wrong.

06:14.599 --> 06:16.721
Elijah called. Klaus is gone.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.304
We don't know where he went.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.086
That settles it. We got to get out of here.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.855
What about the others?

06:24.678 --> 06:26.826
All right, everybody. Listen up.

06:28.790 --> 06:31.685
I want to thank you
all for staying with us,

06:31.715 --> 06:33.383
protecting us.

06:33.413 --> 06:36.207
For the past few weeks, each one of you

06:36.237 --> 06:39.287
has shown me more kindness
than I have ever known.

06:40.122 --> 06:42.575
Despite hardships and tragedy,

06:43.100 --> 06:46.200
you've all become the
family that I always wanted.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.416
You're my pack,

06:49.951 --> 06:51.418
but I can't let you risk your lives

06:51.420 --> 06:53.857
any more than you already have.

06:54.626 --> 06:56.489
The witch who's coming,

06:56.856 --> 07:00.250
she's powerful, and she's not gonna stop.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.666
Jack and I will be better off taking Hope

07:03.696 --> 07:09.730
and getting as far away as we can alone.

07:11.346 --> 07:15.031
I want you to know how grateful I am

07:15.061 --> 07:20.380
for everything that you
have offered me, us...

07:26.576 --> 07:28.945
But I can't be your queen anymore.

07:44.441 --> 07:46.849
You will always be their queen.

07:55.878 --> 07:57.410
What do you mean he's gone?

07:57.440 --> 07:59.085
<i>Exactly that. The coffin's empty,</i>

07:59.087 --> 08:01.212
and he is nowhere to be found.

08:01.242 --> 08:02.826
If I had to guess, I'd say he's planning

08:02.856 --> 08:05.412
a long list of cruel
and unusual punishments

08:05.442 --> 08:07.719
for his treacherous siblings.

08:07.749 --> 08:09.517
Given that we have an
ancient witch to kill,

08:09.547 --> 08:11.559
I hoped you might try reasoning with him,

08:11.589 --> 08:13.616
ideally before he goes ballistic.

08:13.646 --> 08:15.551
I'm flattered, I guess, but what exactly

08:15.553 --> 08:16.587
am I supposed to say to him?

08:16.617 --> 08:17.987
<i>Look. Anything is
better than nothing</i>

08:17.989 --> 08:19.569
<i>as long as it comes from you.</i>

08:19.851 --> 08:21.890
You're the only person he'll listen to.

08:22.395 --> 08:24.898
Your brother is an
unstable paranoid narcissist

08:24.928 --> 08:26.194
with chronic mood issues

08:26.196 --> 08:27.785
and zero impulse control.

08:27.815 --> 08:28.881
Right now, he's furious because

08:28.911 --> 08:30.516
the people he loves most literally

08:30.518 --> 08:31.622
stabbed him in the heart.

08:31.652 --> 08:32.870
That is his worst fear come true.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.552
What makes you think
he'll listen to anyone,

08:34.582 --> 08:35.578
least of all me?

08:35.607 --> 08:37.322
Please, Cami. Isn't it clear by now

08:37.352 --> 08:39.179
he fancies you?

08:40.666 --> 08:43.227
Will you help us or not?

08:44.655 --> 08:47.229
Yeah. I'll try.

09:00.971 --> 09:02.792
My deadline has come and gone,

09:03.055 --> 09:04.855
and yet you bring me here.

09:05.335 --> 09:06.668
I find it fitting.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.543
This is where Freya
plotted her own treachery.

09:09.573 --> 09:11.239
When I granted you the strength

09:11.241 --> 09:12.533
to overcome that dagger's curse,

09:12.563 --> 09:14.301
I assumed you would thank me by taking

09:14.331 --> 09:17.501
swift and merciless action.

09:17.531 --> 09:20.831
Am I to traipse around in
this monsoon you've created?

09:24.212 --> 09:26.087
This storm is to stop your family

09:26.117 --> 09:27.456
from running with the child,

09:27.486 --> 09:30.563
so I wonder... are you
having second thoughts

09:30.593 --> 09:32.265
about standing against them?

09:32.295 --> 09:34.668
They are the family after all

09:34.698 --> 09:36.898
who left you here to rot.

09:39.888 --> 09:42.659
I assure you there are no second thoughts.

09:42.689 --> 09:43.754
We struck a bargain

09:43.756 --> 09:45.452
for the benefit of your child

09:45.482 --> 09:48.164
so that she would be delivered to me safely

09:48.194 --> 09:51.095
and be content by the
presence of her father.

09:51.097 --> 09:52.449
Make no mistake,

09:52.479 --> 09:55.199
I will take her with or without you.

09:55.351 --> 09:58.986
Let me be clear about one thing, witch.

09:58.988 --> 10:00.488
You need me.

10:00.698 --> 10:02.123
I know my siblings better than anyone,

10:02.125 --> 10:04.358
their strengths, their weaknesses.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.512
They are a powerful and determined lot,

10:06.542 --> 10:08.214
perhaps capable of evading you

10:08.244 --> 10:09.966
for the short year that you have

10:09.996 --> 10:12.062
until your slumber begins anew.

10:12.064 --> 10:14.877
You may well loose everything,

10:16.312 --> 10:18.235
but I know how to vanquish those

10:18.237 --> 10:20.204
who stand against us,

10:20.206 --> 10:24.108
and that is exactly what I intend to do.

10:30.771 --> 10:32.416
The storm has served its purpose.

10:32.568 --> 10:34.645
Now enough delays.

10:34.862 --> 10:36.386
I will take what is owed to me,

10:36.416 --> 10:38.722
and if the mother resists
or attempts to run,

10:38.724 --> 10:41.330
I will kill her myself.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.161
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.098
I have something planned for Hayley

10:48.100 --> 10:50.651
that's far worse than death.

10:51.868 --> 10:52.956
Until Niklaus is found,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.477
Marcel and his men will scour the city.

10:54.507 --> 10:56.546
Assuming Nik doesn't slaughter them.

10:56.576 --> 10:58.768
You know as well as I do
he'll be on the warpath,

10:58.798 --> 11:00.010
which again raises the question

11:00.012 --> 11:01.724
how in the hell is he even awake?

11:01.754 --> 11:03.680
It was Dahlia.

11:03.682 --> 11:06.021
This was all part of her plan.

11:06.176 --> 11:07.923
No doubt she killed Aiden, hoping

11:07.953 --> 11:09.855
that the blame would fall on Klaus,

11:09.885 --> 11:11.209
the family would divide,

11:11.239 --> 11:13.056
and she could win Klaus to her cause.

11:13.058 --> 11:14.624
That is absurd.

11:14.726 --> 11:16.226
Nik would never align with Dahlia.

11:16.228 --> 11:17.953
You continue to defend him.

11:17.983 --> 11:19.854
He'd kill anyone who
tried to take his daughter.

11:19.884 --> 11:22.204
Isn't it Hayley who is
trying to take his daughter?

11:22.234 --> 11:23.484
Their daughter.

11:23.810 --> 11:27.254
Let's not forget that
Dahlia's the true enemy here.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.190
How good then that I finished my spell.

11:30.402 --> 11:31.625
The ingredients in the paint

11:31.627 --> 11:32.981
of his artwork combined with my blood

11:33.011 --> 11:35.112
will render Dahlia vulnerable.

11:35.142 --> 11:37.986
The moment she passes
between these paintings,

11:38.016 --> 11:39.788
she will be mortal.

11:41.171 --> 11:43.953
You can kill her using this.

11:48.092 --> 11:49.726
Father's knife.

11:49.728 --> 11:51.478
I thought it appropriate.

11:52.972 --> 11:54.202
We have a visitor.

11:55.766 --> 11:57.167
You shouldn't be here.

11:57.169 --> 11:59.024
Marcel told me about Josephine.

11:59.054 --> 12:00.442
I want to know who we need to kill.

12:00.472 --> 12:01.593
We don't need kill anyone.

12:01.623 --> 12:02.754
Leave here now, please.

12:02.784 --> 12:05.992
You know what? I am done
taking orders from you.

12:05.994 --> 12:07.115
Who do you think you are?

12:07.145 --> 12:08.028
Now is not the time for this.

12:08.058 --> 12:09.603
- It never is.
- Nor is it the place.

12:09.633 --> 12:10.730
Now believe me when I tell you

12:10.760 --> 12:13.040
- you cannot be here.
- Is this...

12:13.398 --> 12:16.236
Is this is this your way
of looking out for me?

12:16.266 --> 12:19.938
Whatever. Too bad I
don't play guessing games.

12:29.969 --> 12:31.367
You don't have to.

12:32.581 --> 12:33.939
Go.

12:39.414 --> 12:40.772
Please.

12:43.214 --> 12:45.650
If you find him, keep your distance.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.617
Call me. I'll handle it.

12:47.619 --> 12:49.789
Sound advice.

12:51.095 --> 12:52.990
Although I do wonder...

12:53.297 --> 12:54.049
Hey...

12:54.079 --> 12:55.947
How exactly would you handle me?

12:55.977 --> 12:57.877
Now before you get angry...

12:58.431 --> 13:00.556
I am well past angry, Marcellus.

13:00.586 --> 13:03.138
I am mad with rage, but
today is your lucky day

13:03.168 --> 13:04.935
because I'm not gonna kill you.

13:04.965 --> 13:06.519
No. I need something from you,

13:06.521 --> 13:08.159
so instead I'm gonna take solace

13:08.189 --> 13:10.769
in the anticipation of
ripping it out of you.

13:27.198 --> 13:28.856
And you are certain this can work?

13:28.886 --> 13:31.335
Let's not toss around words like "certain."

13:31.387 --> 13:34.598
Nonsense. You grow more
adept with magic each day,

13:34.628 --> 13:37.090
and this spell is flawless,

13:37.120 --> 13:39.359
though I might have preferred
Elijah ask my permission

13:39.361 --> 13:41.417
before volunteering me as the bait.

13:41.447 --> 13:43.780
I'm not in the habit of asking permission.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.516
No matter. We have all that we need.

13:46.518 --> 13:48.051
Rebekah will perform the spell,

13:48.053 --> 13:50.220
using my heartbeat and the golem to craft

13:50.250 --> 13:52.117
the illusion of Hope's presence.

13:52.147 --> 13:53.719
Once Dahlia's lured
into the killing ground,

13:53.749 --> 13:55.749
you will do what is necessary.

13:56.668 --> 13:57.977
You're rather calm, which is odd

13:58.007 --> 13:58.989
since there are a million ways

13:59.019 --> 14:01.217
this whole plan could fall to pieces.

14:02.524 --> 14:04.252
I admit...

14:04.282 --> 14:06.509
At first I was upset when
Elijah ignored my plan

14:06.511 --> 14:08.011
in favor of his own.

14:09.537 --> 14:11.867
You are all so determined to protect Hope

14:11.897 --> 14:12.997
at all cost.

14:13.446 --> 14:15.351
Perhaps I'm envious.

14:15.353 --> 14:18.821
No one ever fought so hard to protect me.

14:20.495 --> 14:23.945
Then I recalled what I saw
when I looked inside your mind,

14:24.719 --> 14:28.331
the day you all swore and
oath to stand by one another

14:28.479 --> 14:30.439
always and forever.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.271
There's strength in such vows.

14:32.301 --> 14:35.560
I can assure you it has not
been free of consequence.

14:35.590 --> 14:37.524
That is an understatement.

14:37.526 --> 14:40.493
Ask me, that vow's been
more trouble than it's worth.

14:40.906 --> 14:42.662
And yet here you are,

14:42.967 --> 14:44.536
proving my point.

14:44.740 --> 14:48.070
Family defines you even if
it does demand sacrifice.

14:52.812 --> 14:56.897
My entire life, I have
longed for what you have.

14:57.695 --> 15:00.613
It is better to at least
glimpse it facing death

15:00.615 --> 15:03.816
than run forever and
know nothing of family.

15:09.940 --> 15:11.861
Wakey, wakey.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.094
I was getting bored,

15:15.353 --> 15:17.263
but then some of your associates popped by

15:17.265 --> 15:19.179
to keep me entertained.

15:19.898 --> 15:21.319
- Keep them out of this.
- Easy,

15:21.349 --> 15:22.702
easy. You've suffered

15:22.704 --> 15:24.559
a substantial amount of blood loss.

15:24.589 --> 15:27.923
I had to excise the
vervain from your system,

15:27.925 --> 15:29.425
but then I can't have you impervious

15:29.427 --> 15:31.596
to my compulsion now, can I?

15:31.788 --> 15:34.861
Agh! Unh!

15:38.134 --> 15:40.304
Hello.

15:41.238 --> 15:45.407
Pretty, I think you're
gonna come in rather useful

15:45.409 --> 15:46.860
later on.

15:47.639 --> 15:48.844
You've got what you came for.

15:48.846 --> 15:50.216
Just kill them and be done with it.

15:50.246 --> 15:52.853
With respect,

15:52.883 --> 15:54.194
dear Aunt Dahlia,

15:54.224 --> 15:56.912
this is all part of my plan.

15:56.942 --> 15:59.610
My family, powerful though they may be,

15:59.640 --> 16:02.941
are bound by love, vows of friendship,

16:02.943 --> 16:06.056
and nauseating romantic entanglements,

16:06.086 --> 16:10.194
all of which I intend to use against them.

16:11.029 --> 16:13.280
Marcellus will help turn the tide.

16:13.310 --> 16:16.144
Mark my words.

16:16.146 --> 16:18.029
By day's end,

16:18.059 --> 16:19.614
they will be laid low,

16:19.885 --> 16:23.026
and my daughter will be safe

16:23.256 --> 16:24.755
with us.

16:25.489 --> 16:27.060
Listen, Davina. The rite of supplication

16:27.090 --> 16:28.077
is just a formality.

16:28.107 --> 16:30.531
You meet the elders and you
show a little bit of respect...

16:30.561 --> 16:33.500
what happened to you just
telling them I'm gonna be regent?

16:33.530 --> 16:36.053
They only listened to me when they
thought I was accepting the job,

16:36.083 --> 16:38.116
and if it's gonna be you,
we got to grease some wheels.

16:38.146 --> 16:39.618
The covens aren't just gonna choose me.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.219
I mean, for that matter,
why'd they want you?

16:41.221 --> 16:43.343
Because they think I'm a selfless saint

16:43.373 --> 16:46.223
who betrayed his wife
to save a bunch of kids.

16:46.337 --> 16:48.977
Hmm. And if I got no one to answer to,

16:48.979 --> 16:50.450
I'm less inclined to play favorites.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.586
Basically, I'm an outsider

16:52.746 --> 16:54.507
just like you.

16:55.602 --> 16:58.002
You know, I was put to
death by people like this.

16:58.004 --> 17:01.239
They sacrificed me and
my friends for nothing.

17:01.269 --> 17:02.467
Yeah.

17:03.026 --> 17:04.200
And as regent, you'd have the power

17:04.230 --> 17:06.928
to make sure nothing like
that ever happened again.

17:11.116 --> 17:13.317
I'm only doing this because you
said it will give me the power

17:13.319 --> 17:15.453
I need to bring back Kol.

17:25.737 --> 17:26.830
This is it.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.334
Good. Tell the others they can go.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.643
We'll be fine from here

17:32.449 --> 17:33.526
they said they're not leaving us

17:33.556 --> 17:35.708
till we get where we're going.

17:38.022 --> 17:39.772
So far, so good.

17:39.802 --> 17:40.995
Here. Let me hold that little girl

17:40.997 --> 17:43.064
while you figure out where to cross.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.605
Here, baby girl.

17:45.635 --> 17:48.211
Aw. I got you right here.

17:54.626 --> 17:55.848
What do you think?

17:55.878 --> 17:57.200
Get across, get to the highway,

17:57.230 --> 17:59.063
steal a car, and just go.

18:02.417 --> 18:03.417
You ok?

18:03.559 --> 18:05.398
It was a nice idea...

18:05.428 --> 18:08.773
marry you, make our people strong,

18:09.324 --> 18:11.614
raise my baby girl surrounded by the pack.

18:11.644 --> 18:12.915
- Hayley.
- This morning when

18:12.945 --> 18:15.251
I told them they could go,

18:15.281 --> 18:16.667
I never let you off the hook.

18:16.821 --> 18:18.814
- Don't.
- I'm sick of

18:18.844 --> 18:21.135
other people making sacrifices for me,

18:21.165 --> 18:22.823
fighting my battles.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.206
Hey. That's what family is.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.663
It's the people you're born to

18:26.693 --> 18:27.681
and the people you choose,

18:27.711 --> 18:30.750
who stand beside you when things are hard.

18:31.638 --> 18:33.672
There ain't no place I'd rather be

18:33.702 --> 18:37.666
than right beside you, ok?

19:01.404 --> 19:05.483
Sin Eh-Tey Ex Avan-ha
Vin Tan-Took Koh.

19:05.513 --> 19:09.099
Sin Eh-Tey Ex Avan-ha
Vin Tan-Took Koh.

19:12.254 --> 19:15.756
Sin Eh-Tey Ex Avan-ha
Vin Tan-Took Koh.

19:18.197 --> 19:21.143
Avan-ha Vin
Tan-Took Koh.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.735
I come all this way

19:39.737 --> 19:41.203
to collect what is owed to me,

19:41.233 --> 19:42.639
and whom should I find?

19:42.669 --> 19:44.140
Tante, please listen.

19:44.142 --> 19:48.003
I betrayed my siblings so
I could procure this child.

19:49.214 --> 19:51.948
Sin Eh-Tey Ex Avan-ha
Vin Tan-Took Koh.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.564
I offer her to you now, and in exchange,

19:54.594 --> 19:56.386
I only ask that you release me

19:56.388 --> 19:58.204
from my obligation to you.

19:58.234 --> 20:00.640
How curious that you should bargain with me

20:00.642 --> 20:02.630
for that which is already mine,

20:02.660 --> 20:04.327
but by all means, make your case

20:04.329 --> 20:05.542
for why you should be freed,

20:05.572 --> 20:07.430
and then I will decide

20:07.432 --> 20:09.432
whether to release you

20:09.434 --> 20:11.300
or kill you

20:11.302 --> 20:13.248
once and for all.

20:17.622 --> 20:19.786
Put me right here. Okay?

20:27.062 --> 20:29.291
- Do you wanna help her?
- Yeah, I got it.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.319
Look what I got.

20:47.057 --> 20:49.742
Ok. Let's go.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.288
Ok. Listen... listen to me, people.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.857
Listen to me, please, now.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.576
This young lady serves as
an opportunity for all of us.

20:57.606 --> 21:01.174
Davina Claire is a remnant
of the failed harvest ritual.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.343
Let's not forget she
aligned with the vampires.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.812
How many witches died because of her?

21:05.814 --> 21:07.847
She was manipulated.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.223
I mean, the ancestors forgave her.

21:09.253 --> 21:10.655
They brought her back to life.

21:10.685 --> 21:11.836
Now that's surely a sign...

21:11.897 --> 21:14.372
She is no regent.

21:14.402 --> 21:16.419
That role was meant for you.

21:16.421 --> 21:17.951
And I already told you I ain't gonna do it.

21:17.981 --> 21:21.467
You recuse yourself and instead
offer up an inferior candidate.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.097
- Hey!
- Davina.

21:23.127 --> 21:25.427
No. I've stood here long enough.

21:27.445 --> 21:30.838
My whole life, the witches of
this city have lived in fear.

21:30.868 --> 21:34.308
Vampires run wild, children are sacrificed.

21:34.338 --> 21:36.427
Nobody took charge.

21:36.457 --> 21:38.351
Now be honest.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.926
Have any of you ever
stood up to the vampires...

21:42.603 --> 21:44.735
The Mikaelsons?

21:44.996 --> 21:48.444
No? Well, I have, and I have won.

21:49.038 --> 21:51.953
Now I might be young, but the truth
is I know better than anyone here

21:51.983 --> 21:54.473
what we're really up against,

21:54.834 --> 21:57.114
and I can help build a peace,

21:57.425 --> 22:00.955
or I can burn our enemies to the ground.

22:02.234 --> 22:05.847
The question isn't whether or
not I should be made regent.

22:06.690 --> 22:10.041
The question is what the
hell would you do without me?

22:12.645 --> 22:16.361
Sin eh-tey ex avan-ha
vin tan-took koh.

22:19.132 --> 22:20.571
You surprise me,

22:20.601 --> 22:24.736
betraying the family you
meant to coax to your side.

22:24.938 --> 22:28.573
How very ruthless of you.

22:28.810 --> 22:31.576
I had hoped that they would
welcome me as a sister.

22:31.578 --> 22:33.176
I was wrong.

22:33.206 --> 22:35.414
Of course you were, you poor, little fool.

22:35.416 --> 22:38.709
To think that Esther's wicked
progeny could ever care for you.

22:38.739 --> 22:40.213
They are known the world over

22:40.243 --> 22:43.486
for obscene acts of violence,
and yet you sought them out

22:43.516 --> 22:47.868
instead of staying where
you belonged... with me.

22:48.921 --> 22:52.497
I offered to protect you for all time,

22:52.499 --> 22:54.566
and you left me,

22:54.773 --> 22:58.670
and now it is you who is alone. But then...

22:58.672 --> 23:01.740
Sin eh-tey ex avan-ha
vin tan-took koh.

23:01.742 --> 23:04.040
Sin eh-tey
ex avan-ha...

23:04.744 --> 23:06.811
Who could love

23:06.813 --> 23:11.505
such a deceitful, little wretch?

23:11.535 --> 23:13.268
Sin eh-tey ex...

23:13.606 --> 23:15.042
Marcel?

23:15.330 --> 23:17.613
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

23:26.617 --> 23:28.252
What have you done?

23:28.282 --> 23:29.984
Elijah, now!

23:32.786 --> 23:36.307
And so the wheel of betrayal
circles round once more.

23:38.520 --> 23:42.178
You treacherous, little shrew!

23:51.289 --> 23:53.441
She's controlling you.

23:53.750 --> 23:56.049
- You have to fight her.
- The only thing she did

23:56.079 --> 23:59.019
is pull out the dagger
you stuck in my heart.

24:14.175 --> 24:16.473
After all I have given you,

24:16.503 --> 24:18.427
this is how you repay me,

24:18.457 --> 24:19.800
a death trap

24:19.802 --> 24:24.777
rendered by those elements
that compose my sole weakness?

24:25.177 --> 24:27.942
And even in this in you fail.

24:28.270 --> 24:30.544
What do I sense?

24:30.822 --> 24:35.899
Sacred soil, viking ash, and
the blood of a witch I loved?

24:41.320 --> 24:43.810
Not the witch I loved most, though.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.084
Oh, Freya.

24:46.114 --> 24:48.019
Did you think that your blood

24:48.049 --> 24:50.964
was the key to my demise?

24:51.266 --> 24:54.273
I only wanted to be free.

24:54.303 --> 24:56.767
You pathetic girl.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.477
How should I punish you?

25:03.768 --> 25:07.648
Oh. I know.

25:07.845 --> 25:10.136
I'll send you to bed early.

25:17.345 --> 25:19.732
She will take... everything from us.

25:19.762 --> 25:22.287
You took everything when you broke our vow.

25:22.317 --> 25:24.156
Perhaps I'll take something from you.

25:24.186 --> 25:25.499
Unh!

25:25.501 --> 25:26.967
Aah!

25:31.160 --> 25:32.305
Elijah?

25:32.307 --> 25:35.261
Gia, be a sweetheart and
take off your daylight ring.

25:35.291 --> 25:37.114
No! No!

25:37.144 --> 25:38.779
I can't stop myself.

25:38.781 --> 25:40.306
No!

25:40.622 --> 25:41.669
No...

25:41.699 --> 25:43.644
Noooo!

25:44.019 --> 25:45.585
Aah!

25:45.891 --> 25:47.379
No!

25:49.478 --> 25:51.684
No! No!

25:59.017 --> 26:01.344
You seem vexed, brother.

26:01.374 --> 26:04.755
Wait until you see what
I've got in store for Hayley.

26:15.950 --> 26:19.637
Is that a hint of the fabled
beast behind the red door?

26:19.667 --> 26:22.246
Come on, brother. Let him out to play.

26:26.186 --> 26:28.912
You should know better
than to fight me in anger,

26:28.942 --> 26:31.389
for my anger is unending.

26:34.788 --> 26:36.258
Klaus!

26:42.532 --> 26:45.142
You shouldn't have come here, Camille.

26:45.172 --> 26:48.814
I came here because you need me.

26:49.020 --> 26:52.678
You need me to tell you that this...

26:53.555 --> 26:56.622
this is not you,

26:56.889 --> 26:58.624
and I know you are hurt,

26:59.001 --> 27:01.466
but please listen to me.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.896
You are better than this.

27:04.076 --> 27:06.302
Is there a problem?

27:06.332 --> 27:08.100
Not at all.

27:08.317 --> 27:10.122
Just another victim.

27:10.152 --> 27:11.547
No.

27:11.806 --> 27:15.385
Klaus, I know you won't hurt me.

27:15.415 --> 27:17.977
I have known that from the second we met.

27:18.247 --> 27:20.024
I trust you.

27:22.587 --> 27:25.122
Then you are already lost.

27:25.425 --> 27:26.912
No!

27:44.454 --> 27:47.551
Quite the sinister plot they had planned.

27:47.553 --> 27:49.387
It would have failed in the end, though.

27:49.389 --> 27:53.345
Just as well you came to
your senses and sided with me.

27:53.375 --> 27:56.032
- Have you lost your mind?
- My mind is quite clear.

27:56.062 --> 27:58.601
I just decided to purge it
of treacherous barnacles.

27:58.631 --> 28:00.837
Bastard! How could you?

28:00.867 --> 28:02.211
Actually, it was rather simple.

28:02.241 --> 28:05.541
I just recalled what Elijah did
to me and reciprocated ten-fold.

28:05.571 --> 28:08.811
Be careful, or I'll apply
the same equation to you.

28:08.841 --> 28:11.575
Marcellus, keep Rebekah here.

28:11.577 --> 28:14.926
If she tries to leave, well,
you do enjoy life as a mortal...

28:14.956 --> 28:17.394
you can punish her by
taking that life away.

28:17.424 --> 28:19.856
- Go to hell.
- If by hell you mean somewhere

28:19.886 --> 28:21.685
you are betrayed by
those you hold most dear,

28:21.687 --> 28:23.449
then it's from hell I've just come.

28:23.479 --> 28:25.990
I didn't much care for it.

28:26.285 --> 28:28.425
Do as you're told.

28:28.815 --> 28:31.528
There's a good lad.

28:31.558 --> 28:34.070
The child's magic is still cloaked.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.200
I shall need your blood to track her.

28:36.202 --> 28:39.191
No. Nik, don't!

28:52.132 --> 28:53.961
Keep your eyes peeled.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.978
So the guys set up a perimeter.

29:03.008 --> 29:05.829
We'll keep first watch.
You should get some rest.

29:05.859 --> 29:07.766
No. Hope's finally sleeping,

29:07.796 --> 29:10.860
Mary's watching her, which means
that we have 5 minutes to think.

29:10.890 --> 29:12.752
Ok. What's on your mind?

29:12.782 --> 29:15.032
I want to decide where we're going.

29:15.062 --> 29:16.446
I don't want to spend our life like this,

29:16.476 --> 29:20.033
always on the run, looking over
our shoulders everywhere we go.

29:20.063 --> 29:21.578
If that's what we got to do...

29:21.580 --> 29:25.406
I know, and I'm not afraid. I just...

29:25.765 --> 29:29.519
I want something better for her, for us.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.105
So what do you think?

29:32.135 --> 29:34.635
Montana, North Dakota,

29:34.665 --> 29:36.366
Washington?

29:36.396 --> 29:38.476
We can go wherever you want.

29:40.325 --> 29:42.532
Jack.

29:42.835 --> 29:45.769
Look. I know that I don't have to say this,

29:45.941 --> 29:48.215
and I know that we're in a
junkyard in the middle of nowhere,

29:48.245 --> 29:51.246
which is the least romantic place
to say this for the first time,

29:51.276 --> 29:52.709
but...

29:57.526 --> 30:00.107
I just want you to know that I love you.

30:08.267 --> 30:09.562
Think it through.

30:09.592 --> 30:11.775
If I try to go, you kill me.

30:11.805 --> 30:14.436
- If I remove these...
- That is the same as trying to go.

30:14.466 --> 30:16.105
Can't you fight the compulsion?

30:16.135 --> 30:19.244
He bled the vervain out of my body.

30:24.293 --> 30:29.007
Maybe this is all part
of Nik's twisted revenge.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.161
He doesn't mean for me to die.

30:31.191 --> 30:34.732
He wants you to kill this body
so I wake up in the original,

30:34.762 --> 30:38.451
robbing me of my one chance
to have everyrthing I want...

30:38.759 --> 30:41.715
children, my promise to Kol.

30:41.745 --> 30:43.526
Then we don't give him
what he wants, all right?

30:43.556 --> 30:45.628
Don't run, and I won't hurt you.

30:45.630 --> 30:50.433
I won't let that witch
get her hands on my niece,

30:50.863 --> 30:53.735
which means we're gonna
have to do this the hard way.

31:01.435 --> 31:04.226
What about Alaska?

31:04.397 --> 31:06.282
I could live in Alaska.

31:18.298 --> 31:20.968
Good evening, crescents.

31:21.362 --> 31:23.552
It will come as no surprise to learn

31:23.582 --> 31:26.735
that things will not
be ending well for you.

31:27.217 --> 31:29.672
Go back inside. Get Hope
and Mary out of here.

31:29.702 --> 31:31.251
- I can help you.
- I'll be right behind you.

31:31.281 --> 31:33.809
- Jack.
- Just get Hope and run.

31:44.324 --> 31:45.982
Let's take him.

31:58.331 --> 31:59.698
Agh!

32:03.825 --> 32:05.926
You think you can defeat me

32:05.956 --> 32:07.222
with your toys?

32:07.224 --> 32:09.424
We're just getting warmed up.

32:09.426 --> 32:10.770
So Hayley runs,

32:10.800 --> 32:13.278
and you hold the line. How valiant.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.910
Not too bright, though.

32:15.167 --> 32:19.286
You do remember our last
somewhat one-sided altercation.

32:23.414 --> 32:26.337
This ain't gonna be like last time.

32:26.943 --> 32:28.086
What about Jack?

32:28.116 --> 32:29.644
He and the others will meet us up the road.

32:29.674 --> 32:31.412
Ohh!

32:33.248 --> 32:35.106
It's her... Dahlia.

32:35.136 --> 32:36.817
All the more reason to go.

32:40.182 --> 32:41.515
No.

32:42.662 --> 32:43.891
I'm not gonna teach my daughter

32:43.893 --> 32:47.328
that it's ok to leave
the ones you love to die.

32:47.534 --> 32:52.303
Take her and get her as far
away from here as you can.

32:53.017 --> 32:56.003
It's ok. It's ok, baby.

32:58.350 --> 33:01.675
Mama's gonna catch up
with you real quick, ok?

33:01.947 --> 33:03.432
What about you?

33:03.462 --> 33:05.012
I'm gonna rip that bitch apart.

33:05.014 --> 33:07.153
That's not happening! End of discussion!

33:07.183 --> 33:10.089
Think about it. Why did mother
want to destroy my true body?

33:10.119 --> 33:12.516
Answer... to ensure I could never go back,

33:12.546 --> 33:14.057
meaning if something happens to this one

33:14.087 --> 33:16.532
my spirit's default is to
jump back to the original.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.313
Yeah, but do you really want
to bet your life on that?

33:18.343 --> 33:20.215
Of course, I don't want to!

33:20.245 --> 33:22.342
That's part of Nik's maniacal plan.

33:22.372 --> 33:25.088
- He's not leaving me a choice.
- Oh!

33:25.430 --> 33:27.101
What if he just wants you dead?

33:27.103 --> 33:31.215
No. However angry he is, I know my brother.

33:31.245 --> 33:35.037
Endless torment, fine, but
he will never let me die.

33:35.738 --> 33:40.647
So all we have to do is just play this out.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.451
I try to go, you kill me,

33:44.453 --> 33:46.039
and then...

33:46.347 --> 33:48.755
I wake up in my true body.

33:48.757 --> 33:50.251
Don't make me to do this, all right?

33:50.281 --> 33:52.731
I don't want to hurt you,
but if you don't back down,

33:52.761 --> 33:54.976
I won't be able to stop myself.

33:57.087 --> 33:59.600
Marcel Gerard,

33:59.602 --> 34:02.936
you really do care for me.

34:02.938 --> 34:08.646
Well, the least I can do is save
you from the awful act itself.

34:31.567 --> 34:34.426
Ah. You have gotten stronger.

34:34.614 --> 34:38.138
I reckon you've gone from
field mouse to lapdog.

34:38.458 --> 34:39.873
Come on then.

34:55.373 --> 34:57.253
Enough.

34:58.662 --> 35:00.618
Why is she with you, Klaus?

35:00.648 --> 35:03.997
Unlike some, he's doing what
is best for his daughter.

35:04.027 --> 35:06.345
I'm gonna skin you alive!

35:06.375 --> 35:08.102
Aah!

35:16.316 --> 35:17.684
What are you doing to us?

35:17.714 --> 35:19.391
Oh, this?

35:19.421 --> 35:22.081
No. This was my idea,

35:22.111 --> 35:24.586
stealing from Marcel the Crescent curse

35:24.616 --> 35:27.098
he once used on your pack.

35:27.128 --> 35:29.967
Dahlia was all too happy to
make the necessary adjustments

35:29.997 --> 35:33.005
to accommodate your hybrid nature.

35:34.263 --> 35:37.012
So now you will be trapped in wolf form,

35:37.042 --> 35:39.735
save for the full moon, leaving
you very little time to cause

35:39.765 --> 35:41.801
any further mischief.

35:41.803 --> 35:43.754
Aah!

35:44.316 --> 35:46.467
And because of the unification ritual

35:46.497 --> 35:49.075
linking you to your pack,

35:49.292 --> 35:53.462
now they will share your fate, Queen.

35:53.492 --> 35:54.774
Unh!

36:15.417 --> 36:18.670
Please. Please don't do this, Klaus.

36:20.793 --> 36:22.837
She's gonna steal our baby.

36:22.867 --> 36:25.802
It was you who tried to steal my child,

36:25.832 --> 36:27.703
and for that,

36:27.733 --> 36:30.114
you will suffer.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.733
Aah!

36:33.654 --> 36:35.306
Aah!

37:02.453 --> 37:04.654
Fellow witches of New Orleans,

37:04.656 --> 37:07.157
the ancestors call us
here today to bear witness

37:07.159 --> 37:10.727
as I accept the role
of regent to our people.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.662
Should any among you have cause to argue

37:12.664 --> 37:14.348
my acceptance of this role,

37:14.378 --> 37:16.933
now is your final chance to speak.

37:19.803 --> 37:21.838
Then it's settled.

37:40.757 --> 37:45.328
Not too long ago, I was
sacrificed by own coven.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.623
Feeling betrayed, I sided with vampires

37:47.653 --> 37:50.672
against the very witches who lied to me,

37:50.702 --> 37:54.895
but tonight, I say let
the past be the past.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.240
From now on, we stand together

37:57.242 --> 37:59.575
against anyone who dare hold us down,

37:59.577 --> 38:03.068
even Klaus Mikaelson himself.

38:03.393 --> 38:06.515
Here and now

38:06.517 --> 38:09.285
begins the time of the witches.

38:26.457 --> 38:27.568
Hey.

38:27.598 --> 38:29.405
Daddy's here.

38:29.407 --> 38:32.902
It's all gonna be ok, I promise.

38:34.303 --> 38:36.178
And there she is.

38:43.260 --> 38:45.500
Such a beautiful child.

38:57.850 --> 38:59.167
No!

38:59.428 --> 39:02.829
Camille, you must do exactly as I say.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.898
I want to thank you

39:18.928 --> 39:21.170
for your hand in procuring her for me.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.458
It must not have been easy

39:23.488 --> 39:25.026
betraying your family.

39:25.028 --> 39:26.862
I will not see my daughter handed over

39:26.864 --> 39:29.304
like the spoils of some war.

39:29.334 --> 39:32.205
To that end, I remind you of your promise.

39:32.235 --> 39:34.769
You will protect and mentor Hope,

39:34.771 --> 39:39.641
drawing from her only what power
you require to keep her safe.

40:02.341 --> 40:04.922
I will bond her to me first.

40:05.669 --> 40:08.652
Once I can channel Hope's power,

40:08.943 --> 40:11.763
I will be able to keep
her safe from all harm,

40:11.793 --> 40:15.028
always under my protection.

40:17.906 --> 40:19.752
I think not.

40:20.590 --> 40:23.376
Elijah? Elijah, you have to listen to me.

40:23.406 --> 40:26.173
He got in my head, he spoke to me.

40:27.079 --> 40:29.123
You offered an alliance that
would benefit my daughter,

40:29.125 --> 40:30.435
and now you wish to link to her,

40:30.465 --> 40:33.184
even though you yourself still
suffer from that sleep spell.

40:33.214 --> 40:36.532
I will not lose my
daughter to your affliction.

40:36.562 --> 40:39.403
I will use her power to
free myself as I said.

40:39.433 --> 40:41.574
And if you fail

40:41.604 --> 40:46.146
or if Hope is not strong enough?
She is, after all, but a child.

40:46.442 --> 40:48.832
I will not condemn her to your fate,

40:48.862 --> 40:52.097
not when there is so
obvious an alternative.

40:54.042 --> 40:57.284
This, all of this, it's a trick.

40:58.755 --> 41:00.789
You've lost your mind.

41:01.224 --> 41:03.483
- He has lost his mind.
- He needs her to trust him

41:03.513 --> 41:05.648
so he can do what he needs to do.

41:05.678 --> 41:08.312
If you require power to be immortal

41:08.314 --> 41:10.141
without the need to sleep for centuries,

41:10.171 --> 41:15.019
then why not channel one
who already has eternal life?

41:16.888 --> 41:19.290
Bond yourself to me,

41:19.474 --> 41:21.611
the immortal hybrid.

41:22.369 --> 41:26.836
Once your sleep spell is
broken, then and only then

41:27.117 --> 41:29.933
may you link yourself to Hope.

41:38.524 --> 41:40.814
He had to make it look convincing.

41:40.844 --> 41:41.981
What...

41:42.011 --> 41:45.415
To... to... to what possible end?

41:45.616 --> 41:48.552
He told me her secret.

41:48.554 --> 41:51.292
I know how we can kill Dahlia.
