00:06.840 --> 00:09.717
Seven-year-old female,
struck by a vehicle. GCS 3.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.760
Chest injury, possible internal bleeding.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.679
- Stay with me, baby, please.
- ETA, three minutes.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.597
We're here, love. We're right here.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.974
Let's get her typed
and crossed for three units.

00:17.058 --> 00:18.058
Oh, Kira, please.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.519
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.188
- This is as far as you can go.
- No! No!

00:23.273 --> 00:24.690
--Sarah! Sarah!

00:25.984 --> 00:27.443
We have to let them do theirjob.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.779
On three. One, two, three.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.950
I want an ultra sound and a trauma series.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.118
Chest, pelvic, C spine.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.162
Let's get a level one
on standby and a crash cart,

00:38.246 --> 00:39.371
we may need to intubate.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.123
- OR's being prepped.
- Good.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.628
I should've known Helena would find us.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.131
I should've stopped her.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.636
I won't have you blaming yourself.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.472
You did not bring this on.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.223
She's gonna be okay, Sarah.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.684
- She has to be.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.520
Can I get anybody some coffee?

01:05.899 --> 01:06.899
Alison...

01:07.275 --> 01:08.317
I know you mean well.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.401
- I know you do.
- Oh.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.944
- It's just...
- I know. I know. I'm in the way.

01:10.987 --> 01:11.987
Yeah.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.283
I just can't help
but feel like it's my daughter in there.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.662
You should go home.
You should get some sleep.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.624
I can't go home, Felix. I...

01:25.168 --> 01:26.335
I assaulted my monitor.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.504
I'll get black bagged like Sarah

01:29.339 --> 01:31.006
and carted off to God knows where.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.008
Right...

01:33.676 --> 01:35.344
Use my place then.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.888
Thank you.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.681
I'll call you if we hear anything.

01:46.940 --> 01:47.940
Okay.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.654
Ultrasound's up.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.490
Heart rate's at 80.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.575
BP, 85 over 50.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.162
Doctor, you need to see this.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.763
What's happening?

02:21.307 --> 02:23.100
It looks like Kira's going to be okay.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.229
What does "looks like" mean?

02:27.438 --> 02:30.649
Well, she's been sedated, but her blood
pressure and breathing have stabilized.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.775
Her ribs are intact.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.694
There's no internal bleeding, no head trauma.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.363
I think she's gonna be fine.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.450
She was run right over. I saw it.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.911
Then she's a very lucky girl.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.413
--She's okay.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.790
She's okay, she's okay, she's okay.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.673
My baby.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.067
Mommy, she looks like you.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.902
She looks like Mommy.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.447
Just sleep now, monkey.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.449
I'll keep you safe from her.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.869
I promise.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.839
There was a girl. A little girl.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.385
Easy child. Pull yourself together.

04:21.636 --> 04:22.970
Sarah is her mother.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.388
That's ridiculous.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.639
Not possible.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.775
The girl was hit by a car because of me.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.361
She's all right?

04:40.363 --> 04:42.155
Yeah, yeah. She's fast asleep.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.450
How about you then?

04:46.035 --> 04:47.703
You thanking your lucky stars?

04:48.246 --> 04:49.705
I don't believe in miracles.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.791
Kids are made of rubber, Sarah.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.001
She got lucky.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.502
Just like the doctor said.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.170
You didn't see it.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.131
Count your blessings.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.465
Move on to your worries.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.593
Yeah. Helena's gotta go.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.639
I got a dozen reasons to bring Beth back in.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.142
Look, we got three sets of matching prints.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.226
Jumper looks just like her.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.729
And we got a smooth little rent
boy connected to them both.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.731
All right. All right, I know, Angie.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.442
And here we got Jane Doe,
the one that started it all.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.152
Bet you 100 bucks
I know what she's gonna look like

05:20.236 --> 05:21.737
when Beckwith is done
with the reconstruction.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.196
You got no charge that'll stick yet.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.366
Obstruction. This all comes on the
heels of that civilian shooting.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.577
- So what?
- So, she could be protecting the killer.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.456
How's it going?

05:33.666 --> 05:35.167
Still pushing for a break, sir.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.087
Grigson and Chow
just solved that stabbing in the junction.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.757
Maybe you need a fresh
pair of eyes here, huh?

05:41.883 --> 05:43.633
No, we're good, sir. We're good.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.428
Just give us till the end of the day.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.936
You want me to throw
my ex-partner under the bus?

05:55.480 --> 05:56.521
Hmm?

05:56.606 --> 05:57.856
If I'm wrong about this,

05:58.399 --> 06:00.317
you'll be the last partner I ever have.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.944
I don't know, Art.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.946
Starting to wonder.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.824
Does she have something on you?

06:14.248 --> 06:15.374
End of day, Angie.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.179
If this is true, if the child's actually hers...

06:31.599 --> 06:32.849
How could you let her go?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.518
She's innocent.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.270
I did what I was told. I...

06:37.814 --> 06:39.439
Used Sarah to get to the others.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.899
Then where are the others?

06:44.821 --> 06:46.071
Why is Sarah still alive?

06:46.155 --> 06:49.241
That man Olivier took off
his beast-tail for you.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.325
Yes.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.619
To get Dr. Leekie's attention!

06:53.121 --> 06:56.123
The child will be valuable to them.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.293
No, no.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.754
That's her.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.841
Tell her to come here.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.843
Tell her!

07:10.388 --> 07:11.513
Helena!

07:11.848 --> 07:13.390
Is Kira all right?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.517
I'll tell you in person.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.352
Where are you?

07:17.728 --> 07:20.272
It... it was an accident.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.565
Tell her.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.413
Lovely apartment for a young couple.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.793
Uh...

07:43.963 --> 07:45.172
Very convincing.

07:46.757 --> 07:50.093
Unfortunately, the lie Olivier
told last night was not.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.179
What lie?

07:52.513 --> 07:56.057
Someone tampered with
the security footage at club Neolution.

07:56.392 --> 08:00.187
But I know there were
two clones there that night.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.022
Weren't there?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.903
I've searched for the lost clone,
Helena, for years.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.238
She's my white whale, Paul.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.823
But she's feral.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.408
She couldn't fool you.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.036
Impersonate Beth...

08:16.746 --> 08:17.996
Under this roof...

08:18.372 --> 08:19.372
In that bed.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.793
But Sarah Manning could.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.337
Oh.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.630
What the hell!

09:09.048 --> 09:10.674
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

09:11.425 --> 09:12.717
So, Kira's going to be okay?

09:13.094 --> 09:15.262
Yes. Miraculous recovery.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.139
Uh, where's my uh...

09:18.474 --> 09:19.558
Oh, your...

09:20.101 --> 09:23.103
Drug paraphernalia is in a drawer.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.814
So is the paraphernalia that was by your bed.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.983
Did you wash that, too?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.111
Uh, my children are
at my mother's house right now.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.529
I'm a danger to them.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.616
So, I was thinking, I could use this house

09:36.659 --> 09:39.536
as a base while I apartment hunt.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.204
No.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.165
Well, Donnie's staying
clear of the house for a few hours, so...

09:45.001 --> 09:48.545
I just need to go by,
get some sundries, and clothing.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.466
Fine. You can stay one night.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.177
Just don't wake me on your way back in.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.227
Felix.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.562
I'm a pariah.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.314
I can't go back there alone.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.484
I need you to be my wingman.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.779
Are you bloody serious?

10:19.952 --> 10:20.952
Please.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.040
I need to change.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.167
Fetch me something gay.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.630
Holy shit! Sarah, I'm so relieved.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.132
Yeah, even the doctors were stunned.

10:34.258 --> 10:38.553
Do you think because Kira's mine,
she might be different?

10:38.888 --> 10:40.096
Because she's uninjured?

10:40.264 --> 10:41.556
Yeah, it's just a question.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.601
Well, if they
genetically modified us,

10:44.935 --> 10:46.936
I mean, you could have
passed something down to her.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.438
Like what?

10:48.773 --> 10:51.316
I don't know. Lizards regrow limbs.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.653
Cosima, Kira's not a lizard.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.238
Right. Well, it's not magic.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.616
Uh, it's just stem cells, you know.

10:59.825 --> 11:04.287
Look, I have a guy who's sequencing the
German's DNA alongside mine

11:04.372 --> 11:06.623
to see if the illness she had was genetic.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.584
If you want, I can give him

11:09.710 --> 11:11.961
samples of you and Kira to compare.

11:12.254 --> 11:15.423
Yeah. I'm not giving you our genetic material.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.592
You'll probably hand it over to Delphine.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.887
Dude, I'm just doing what we agreed.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.348
- Okay? I'm following the science.
- Yeah, well...

11:23.683 --> 11:25.934
I worry about scientists more than science.

11:28.771 --> 11:29.813
Got to go.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.152
Hey, I got it.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.950
- Hey.
- Hey. Coloring books and puzzles.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.244
She's sleeping.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.538
Uh, Mrs. S, this is Paul.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.206
Pleasure.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.333
- Paul?
- She knows everything.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.960
Well, not everything.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.044
Clearly.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.048
Well, don't hold it against me,
but I have some bad news.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.677
Dr. Leekie knows who you are, Sarah.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.933
Let go! Let go.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.939
No!

12:13.023 --> 12:14.190
No! No!

12:23.325 --> 12:24.617
I gave you everything,

12:25.494 --> 12:27.162
a reason for living,

12:27.329 --> 12:29.581
- and in return, weakness.
- Tomas, please...

12:31.500 --> 12:33.668
if you protect this forgery...

12:36.255 --> 12:37.630
You're no better than they are.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.678
You're no better than they are!

12:43.763 --> 12:44.763
No!

12:54.315 --> 12:55.315
Leekie wants to meet?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.150
Says he wants to make a deal.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.778
He knows you're aware,
in contact with each other.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.862
How?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.155
Did Cosima give me up?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.032
Look, this is an opportunity.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.202
You sound exactly like her.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.205
I don't trust him either.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.625
- But the genie's out of the bottle.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.834
For them, too.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.212
Your interests have aligned.
You can get answers.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.798
Or I could get black bagged and abducted.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.091
What if there was a way to meet him safely?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.385
On your terms.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.557
Over 4,000 base pairs from each sample,

13:29.642 --> 13:31.017
sequenced and analyzed.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.977
Awesome. Awesome.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.729
Okay, what did you... What did you find?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.106
- No markers for respiratory disease.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.818
This sequence is anomalous
for Cytochrome C.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.695
And then, this piece
is distinct in each sample.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.781
They're different.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.575
That's... That's crazy.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.411
What are you looking for, really?

13:50.704 --> 13:52.247
Not respiratory disease.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.082
Nope.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.375
Hey.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.835
Hey!

13:57.920 --> 14:00.672
- Hey.
- Uh, Scott, this is Delphine.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.841
- Hello.
- Hey.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.927
Uh, I have to run to class

14:05.970 --> 14:07.679
but I was wondering if I could...

14:08.264 --> 14:09.639
...come over later.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.432
Yeah, of course.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.101
Okay.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.356
Whoa! Wow!

14:18.607 --> 14:19.649
Okay.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.282
Bye.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.551
If she wakes up, just tell her
I'm gonna be right back.

14:47.469 --> 14:48.636
And will you?

14:49.597 --> 14:50.597
Yeah.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.017
Are you gonna be okay here?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.480
Don't you worry about Helena.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.609
Shotgun. Forgot about that.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.986
One of the great things about this country,

15:05.821 --> 15:07.739
hunting's not just for the rich.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.878
Kind of busy here, Art.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.755
Pilates can wait, Beth.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.173
We need to talk.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.466
We already did that.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.968
Off the record this time. No one else.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.220
This is your last chance.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.015
Where are you?

15:34.642 --> 15:36.517
You know, I get crow's feet

15:36.560 --> 15:37.852
if I don't get enough shuteye.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.481
I will have you back on your couch in a jiff.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.360
- Oh, my God!
- Alison.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.404
What, what... What's going on? What is this?

15:48.489 --> 15:52.116
We're gathered in the spirit
of love and understanding.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.619
Please, join us.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.037
An intervention?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.375
This is bullshit!

16:01.710 --> 16:02.752
Hello!

16:02.920 --> 16:05.713
- Felix. Gay friend.
- Acting coach.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.548
Oh, that's perfectly fine here.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.884
- Which one?
- Yes, yes.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.552
Please join us.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.888
Alison, your... Your friends have shown

16:13.931 --> 16:17.100
great strength
in setting aside their pain and hurt

16:17.226 --> 16:18.893
in order to talk with you today.

16:19.728 --> 16:20.728
Mmm-hmm.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.067
Donnie, why don't you
go ahead and get us started?

16:26.485 --> 16:27.485
Uh...

16:27.611 --> 16:28.611
Yeah.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.782
Alison...

16:34.493 --> 16:37.370
The pills and the drinking,

16:37.663 --> 16:38.913
it has to stop.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.582
Mmm.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.752
I don't think you know
how hard this has been for me.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.422
The constant criticism,

16:47.798 --> 16:49.340
the abuse...

16:49.466 --> 16:51.009
You can be specific, Donnie.

16:54.096 --> 16:57.223
You hit me with a golf club.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.477
You burned my chest with hot glue.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.438
It still hurts in the shower, Alison.

17:03.647 --> 17:04.689
Donnie...

17:04.772 --> 17:07.233
Alison, it's actually
important for you to just

17:07.276 --> 17:08.483
try and listen right now.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.694
Aynsley.

17:11.989 --> 17:15.282
Alison, you took advantage of my husband,

17:15.659 --> 17:18.036
and may have ruined my marriage, too.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.329
You threatened and assaulted me.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.208
But I think what really hurts is that you...

17:24.501 --> 17:26.794
...turned your back on our friendship.

17:27.503 --> 17:29.005
- Donnie, tell her that we...
- Mom!

17:29.506 --> 17:30.757
I will.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.886
It's... it's not just about you and me, Alison.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.637
It's about our kids.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.308
Do you really want to break up our family?

17:47.649 --> 17:48.649
Alison.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.629
I have two minutes.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.506
Two minutes?

18:12.049 --> 18:14.258
That's all I get for two years by your side.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.894
- Who's that?
- Felix Dawkins.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.063
Your look-alike
Sarah Manning's foster brother.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.358
Yeah, and...

18:30.651 --> 18:32.276
You visited his place a few weeks back

18:32.361 --> 18:33.861
with $75,000 in your trunk.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.614
The day I stopped you from skipping town.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.158
It's all coming back
to the Maggie Chen shooting.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.745
You don't wanna go there, Art.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.040
You put the phone in Maggie Chen's hand.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.835
You helped me
make it look like it was an accident.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.962
I was trying to help my partner.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.549
This is your last chance
to come clean with me, Beth.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.388
We do what we gotta do.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.931
Sarah, you were right. I was wrong.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.142
Okay, what have you done with Cosima

19:46.226 --> 19:47.685
'cause this definitely isn't her.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.395
Ha-ha. Okay.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.940
Listen, they can tell us apart by our DNA.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.609
That's how they knew you weren't Beth.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.652
So we're not genetically identical?

19:56.737 --> 19:57.737
We should be.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.864
But there's a synthetic sequence.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.449
I don't know what it is exactly.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.409
But it's like a barcode maybe.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.994
Maybe a way to differentiate us.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.914
Well, that explains
how Olivier knew I wasn't Beth.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.542
But it does not explain
how Leekie knows my name.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.960
He knows who you are?

20:13.003 --> 20:15.296
Yeah. And he knows we're in contact.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.006
Did you say something to Delphine?

20:18.258 --> 20:20.551
No. Sarah, no! I, I...

20:20.636 --> 20:22.386
'Cause they're one step closer to Kira.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.723
Uh, okay.

20:25.849 --> 20:29.769
I would never say anything about you or Kira.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.773
You are the first one of us
to ever even have a child.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.360
I mean, there's not even
taxonomy in the offspring of a clone.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.320
By the way, you got what you wanted.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.821
'Cause I'm about to meet Leekie.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.325
Really?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.204
Just give him a chance.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.622
You might be surprised.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.417
They care about us. They, they, they have to.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.545
Yeah, I was thinking of
putting a gun to his head.

21:01.635 --> 21:02.718
Sorry for the precautions.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.887
No, no, no.
I understand completely.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.584
Hello, Sarah.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.006
Dr. Leekie.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.344
You've gleaned how this works.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.222
There are many questions I can't answer.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.890
That's not good enough.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.394
I understand your frustration,
but like Olivier or Paul,

21:53.478 --> 21:55.021
I only know my part.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.564
So, what is your part?

21:57.232 --> 22:00.985
I oversee data collection
and quantify your well-being.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.031
I look after you.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.116
Not me.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.367
- No.
- Mmm-mmm.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.869
Somehow you got away.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.620
Jesus Christ!

22:11.747 --> 22:13.080
Just tell me why.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.707
What... What is this all about?

22:15.125 --> 22:17.376
We can go further, Sarah. Much further.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.171
But we need to come
to an agreement on something crucial.

22:21.965 --> 22:22.965
Helena.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.302
The common enemy, obviously.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.596
Olivier said she mentioned Tomas.
Who's that?

22:28.638 --> 22:32.266
Great question and one I can answer.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.395
Tomas opposes us, science in general.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.522
They're religious extremists.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.692
Prolethians, they call themselves.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.694
Right, "neolutionist" is way better?

22:44.488 --> 22:47.573
Years ago, one of their agents
infiltrated our project.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.657
Maggie Chen.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.826
- The woman Beth shot?
- Yes.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.454
She and Tomas found Helena in a convent.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.082
Then trained the clone to kill clones.

22:57.709 --> 22:58.876
Brilliant really.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.503
That's brilliant.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.132
So what? You want me to kill her?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.593
No. We don't want to harm her at all.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.678
We want you to bring her in

23:10.389 --> 23:12.306
so we can de-program her.

23:12.724 --> 23:13.974
Get her the help she needs.

23:15.102 --> 23:19.271
You do this, and we can move
forward with a new understanding.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.567
You and your friends
will be free to live as you choose.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.693
No monitors.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.695
You're gonna give us lives?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.406
You've always had lives.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.741
They haven't been directed, just observed.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.410
Except in your case.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.328
And Helena's.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.122
Helene's been under their care.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.625
Which is far, far worse than ours.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.502
Bring her in.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.213
We'll get her the help she needs.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.988
I have the truffles that I promised you.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.450
You okay?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.034
Are you?

24:15.495 --> 24:16.871
I was, but...

24:22.461 --> 24:25.337
Delphine Cormier, not Beraud.

24:25.755 --> 24:28.757
You've already got
your doctorate in immunology, don't you?

24:29.301 --> 24:32.595
I am so sorry.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.223
I am so stupid.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.726
No, no. No, you're not.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.019
You knew this all along.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.272
Yeah, that transcript
you accidentally left behind.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.773
Your fake boyfriend in Paris.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.067
Pretending you didn't know
who Dr. Leekie was.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.777
I knew it was bullshit.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.863
I still thought you were on my side.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.909
I wanted to thrust you.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.202
You can trust me.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.454
You told Leekie I know these girls.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.457
I...had to. Look at me.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.792
He says you're in danger.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.169
Of what?

25:07.214 --> 25:09.131
You... You don't know, do you?

25:11.301 --> 25:12.301
No.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.762
Then you're the real danger, Delphine.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.226
Alison.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.936
You're only making things worse.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.605
I only want to talk to Felix.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.785
This is all Aynsley.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.788
She put them up to this.
It's all part of her experiment.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.123
Yes. How do clones react

25:43.208 --> 25:45.626
when ritually humiliated
by friends and loved ones?

25:45.835 --> 25:46.919
Fascinating.

25:48.755 --> 25:49.797
Hey.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.424
Sharesies?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.936
Maybe it's not just Aynsley.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.896
Maybe they're all monitors.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.690
The reverend seems all right.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.441
Actually, he's kind of sexy.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.859
Man of the cloth and all that.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.738
Felix, what am I gonna do?

26:21.162 --> 26:24.540
Put your chin up, be a woman.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.834
This is backstabbing 101.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.170
I cannot go back out there.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.131
Of course you can.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.343
You're gonna face the music,
eat some humble pie,

26:36.845 --> 26:38.512
hug it out, play possum,

26:39.139 --> 26:40.431
Aynsley's gonna think she's won,

26:40.515 --> 26:42.516
and you are gonna live to fight another day.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.572
Mmm-hmm. Oh, Lord.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.535
Can you help me get my face on?

27:03.371 --> 27:04.455
With pleasure.

27:51.711 --> 27:52.711
Helene still won't answer.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.756
What do you plan to do?

27:55.924 --> 27:57.257
Turn her over to Leekie?

27:58.218 --> 28:01.929
I don't know. I don't know what he's
really gonna do with her, do I?

28:02.514 --> 28:05.057
Does that matter?
She came after your daughter.

28:05.141 --> 28:08.060
Yeah, my gut says
put a bullet in her myself, but...

28:09.437 --> 28:11.563
You don't understand what it's like.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.607
I look at Helena and I see me.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.819
You don't owe her anything, Sarah,

28:19.114 --> 28:20.447
I um...

28:21.866 --> 28:24.410
I got in touch with
my people back in England.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.912
- About where you're really from.
- And?

28:28.581 --> 28:30.082
They said they'd get back to me, but...

28:30.792 --> 28:32.251
They're scared.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.003
As if something's going on over there, too.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.967
Please, Cosima.

28:40.635 --> 28:41.802
Where are you going?

28:42.137 --> 28:43.554
Why, so you can tell Leekie?

28:43.805 --> 28:45.556
I'm such an idiot.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.725
What else did you tell him?

28:47.809 --> 28:48.809
Nothing!

28:49.144 --> 28:50.310
Just the seven names.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.230
Nothing about Kira.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.275
She's an anomaly, you know that?

28:56.651 --> 29:00.654
Delphine, you can use me, that's fine...

29:00.947 --> 29:02.364
But don't go near that little girl.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.949
I didn't and I won't!

29:03.992 --> 29:04.992
Get out!

29:05.076 --> 29:08.495
Please listen to me.
Just let me tell you this one thing.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.789
- Just listen to me.

29:13.084 --> 29:16.420
I didn't want to fall for you.
I wasn't supposed to.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.798
But I have.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.677
How can I possibly
believe that, Delphine?

29:23.720 --> 29:24.803
Because you feel it.

29:26.181 --> 29:29.933
This is not... it's not a lie, it's not possible.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.145
You know, I've never been
with a woman before.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.147
Yeah, it showed.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.536
Twenty-third, right?

29:49.621 --> 29:51.371
Yeah, east platform, north end,

29:51.414 --> 29:54.208
I was, uh, on the other side fixing a derailer.

29:54.876 --> 29:55.876
That's her.

29:59.589 --> 30:00.714
What a shame.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.007
It's Beth.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.885
And then this other lady walks up.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.856
That'd be yourjumper.

30:21.694 --> 30:22.820
Wait, wait, wait!

30:22.904 --> 30:24.446
Rewind that, right, stop right there.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.908
Shit! I never saw it from this angle.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.569
- Helena?
- Sarah!

31:05.613 --> 31:07.906
You're the only one I can really turn to.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.248
How do you know it's not a trap?

31:16.457 --> 31:18.417
- She was convincing.
- It is a trap.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.169
Now you know where she is.
Just give her to Leekie.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.754
I'd have to agree with him at this point.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.507
What, and then what?
Then we're partners with Leekie?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.467
And then, he's going to find out about Kira.

31:27.510 --> 31:28.552
Sarah...

31:28.636 --> 31:30.762
I don't know how
I'm going to play this. Okay?

31:30.805 --> 31:32.973
I just... Just give me a minute.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.147
Hey, you're awake.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.066
How do you feel?

31:43.151 --> 31:44.985
- Tired.
- Yeah.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.155
You had a big crash.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.241
But you're going to be just fine.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.828
It wasn't Helena's fault.

31:56.372 --> 31:57.372
What?

31:57.582 --> 31:59.583
I went outside to play with her.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.045
Did she tell you to say this?

32:04.172 --> 32:05.213
No.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.423
She's dangerous.

32:06.674 --> 32:09.343
She's sick in the head
and it makes her want to hurt us.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.678
She just needs your help.

32:12.972 --> 32:15.933
I'm sorry, Kira, I don't think
anybody can help Helena now.

32:36.329 --> 32:41.667
Alison, I saw you in that van with Chad.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.877
My children saw you.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.838
I just wish you could understand
how much damage you've caused,

32:47.882 --> 32:50.050
I mean, we all trusted you.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.262
Aynsley, you brought us
here today, didn't you?

32:54.347 --> 32:55.931
I care about you, sweetie.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.726
You called all these people
and told them everything.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.437
I'm doing this to help you.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.147
And I thank you.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.611
For scrutinizing every detail of my life,

33:09.696 --> 33:11.321
since the day I moved into this fish pool.

33:11.447 --> 33:15.158
You have pried and snooped
and gossiped about me,

33:15.410 --> 33:18.245
like I was your own, personal,
laboratory subject.

33:19.205 --> 33:22.708
How would you like it if
I turned your life inside-out?

33:23.626 --> 33:26.753
If I told all these people
that Chad, your husband,

33:26.796 --> 33:29.589
slept with a spin class instructor
long before me.

33:29.632 --> 33:33.927
Well, maybe he acts that way
because you blew the roofer at the cabin!

33:35.430 --> 33:36.513
Wow!

33:36.764 --> 33:38.056
Okay, um...

33:38.516 --> 33:40.350
- Alison, you see...
- No!

33:40.435 --> 33:42.102
No more words.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.691
She's right. This has gone far enough.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.609
Mom, everybody, out, now!

33:49.694 --> 33:50.694
Let's go.

33:59.495 --> 34:03.040
This was your olive branch
and you torched it.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.292
Huge mistake.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.842
That went very well.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.344
- I think it went well.
- Yeah.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.719
You came?

35:00.515 --> 35:01.848
How's Kira?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.686
You're never going to see her again.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.106
I would never hurt her.

35:10.024 --> 35:11.691
I wish I could believe you.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.497
Do it.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.048
Shit!

35:36.926 --> 35:38.218
You care.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.096
No, I don't.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.890
Stay back, don't try any shit.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.536
You are all I have now.

36:22.638 --> 36:23.972
I love you.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.943
You must be Sarah?

36:36.986 --> 36:38.320
You can't harm her kid.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.821
Harm her?

36:39.906 --> 36:41.865
No, never. The child is innocent.

36:42.825 --> 36:46.620
You were the light, Helena. You're the
original, you know what that means.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.123
The child is rightfully your daughter.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.919
He's lying! Helena, Helena!
There's no original.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.254
I told you, we're the same.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.714
Neither of us is the original.

36:57.798 --> 36:58.840
Put it down.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.511
Go bring your child home, to her real mother.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.972
Helena, Helena! Look, look...

37:06.015 --> 37:07.849
You know that connection you feel?

37:09.810 --> 37:11.102
I feel it, too.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.314
It's us.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.149
She'll say anything to save herself.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.484
He locked you in a cage!

37:18.486 --> 37:21.154
He lied to you your entire life.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.865
He's going to do that to Kira!

37:25.868 --> 37:28.995
He's going to hurt Kira like he hurt you.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.760
You made me this way.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.095
Helena...

38:07.952 --> 38:09.744
I know what you are.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.413
Yeah, I'm the one with the keys.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.124
Maybe I'll give them to Dr. Leekie.

38:19.714 --> 38:20.880
Come on.

38:29.015 --> 38:32.058
- Sarah! Sarah!

38:35.229 --> 38:37.188
- S?
- Sarah, where are you?

38:37.231 --> 38:38.982
I'm about to give Helena to Leekie.

38:39.191 --> 38:42.652
He knows who I am. He's going to find
out about Kira sooner or later.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.070
You can't.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.740
You need to get back
here right away with Helena.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.742
What? Why?

38:49.076 --> 38:50.869
I'll explain when you get here.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.753
Sarah!

39:25.613 --> 39:26.821
You wanted to see me?

39:26.947 --> 39:28.198
Yeah.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.784
It's about Beth Childs.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.626
Sorry, uh, she said she'd be here.

39:47.301 --> 39:48.343
Yes?

39:48.469 --> 39:49.511
Helena didn't show.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.972
Blood is thicker than you think, Aldous.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.103
Jesus Christ.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.813
How long has Art been sitting on this?

39:59.897 --> 40:01.147
Just a couple of days, sir.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.654
Really, Angela?

40:08.739 --> 40:10.156
You said by the end of the day.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.826
We're getting
an arrest warrant for Beth Childs.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.745
Lieutenant... Beth's dead.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.541
You need a warrant for Sarah Manning.

40:25.714 --> 40:26.840
Where's Helena?

40:27.007 --> 40:28.174
I tied her up in the trunk.

40:29.301 --> 40:30.468
What's going on?

40:35.099 --> 40:37.767
Sarah, this is Amelia.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.311
Hi.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.604
Look at you.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.731
Sarah.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.484
Uh...

40:48.237 --> 40:49.696
I'm your birth mother.

40:54.952 --> 40:59.205
Yeah, I'm not what you expected, I'm sure.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.459
I kind of gave up expecting.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.170
I'm sorry to arrive like this but...

41:05.212 --> 41:06.796
When word came you were looking for me

41:06.881 --> 41:08.715
I had to leave Cape Town in a hurry.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.010
I was being watched, you see...

41:13.137 --> 41:14.721
After all this time they...

41:16.932 --> 41:18.183
They found me again.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.728
I was only 22.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.855
In a new country.

41:23.898 --> 41:27.442
A wealthy couple
asked me to be their in vitro surrogate.

41:27.526 --> 41:28.902
They paid me,

41:28.986 --> 41:32.614
provided a flat in London,
a legal arrangement.

41:32.698 --> 41:33.823
But...

41:33.908 --> 41:35.408
Something was off.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.994
The medical tests were excessive.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.663
And I overheard the couple
talking with the doctors about

41:40.748 --> 41:44.083
a child unfettered by tradition.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.085
An advanced, um...

41:47.379 --> 41:49.088
Evolution of some kind.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.925
- Neolution?
- Yeah!

41:51.967 --> 41:54.093
But they weren't a couple at all.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.929
They were scientists.

41:56.263 --> 41:59.265
The child I carried wasn't meant for them.

42:00.267 --> 42:04.562
I realized the life inside of me was in danger.

42:05.105 --> 42:07.732
So I ran, I hid.

42:08.901 --> 42:11.027
And gave birth to the two of you in secret.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.238
The two of us?

42:13.364 --> 42:14.364
Yeah.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.741
I had twins.

42:17.576 --> 42:19.369
I knew I couldn't keep you.

42:19.995 --> 42:21.287
So I hid you away.

42:22.039 --> 42:25.375
One to the state, and one to the church.

42:28.462 --> 42:29.546
Helena?

42:37.263 --> 42:38.555
Who do you work for?

42:41.350 --> 42:42.725
I need to see you privately.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.143
I have something for you.

42:44.186 --> 42:45.979
- Mind Amelia.
- Why?

42:48.691 --> 42:49.899
I found a known associate.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.734
Isn't this place off limits to you guys?

42:52.236 --> 42:53.861
- Yes?
- Alison!

42:54.697 --> 42:55.780
Cosima!

42:57.366 --> 42:59.659
- Sarah Manning! On the ground, now!
- Sarah Manning!
