Morgan, voice-over:
How's she doing?

01:03.354 --> 01:05.155
Woman: She's was little
agitated this morning,

01:05.156 --> 01:07.122
but I gave her a sedative.

01:07.124 --> 01:09.425
Does she know I'm coming?

01:09.427 --> 01:11.427
Yes, but it's been a year.

01:11.429 --> 01:13.362
I'm sure she doesn't want
to go back over this.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.799
[Beep, door buzzer]

01:16.801 --> 01:18.300
How long will it take?

01:18.302 --> 01:21.170
3, 4 hours, tops.

01:21.172 --> 01:22.805
Because I have to
prep her for trial.

01:22.807 --> 01:24.473
I didn't think
profilers did that.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.408
Profiling is only
one-tenth of what we do.

01:26.410 --> 01:29.178
We also assist the prosecution
once we find the killers.

01:29.180 --> 01:30.245
Agent Morgan. Hi.

01:30.247 --> 01:32.648
Ellen. How are you?

01:32.650 --> 01:33.615
Good.

01:33.617 --> 01:35.417
Daria is really
improving.

01:35.419 --> 01:37.052
It's amazing.
If all goes well,

01:37.054 --> 01:39.588
they say I can
take her home after the trial.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.723
Let's just get through
this first.

01:41.725 --> 01:43.959
This way.

01:49.866 --> 01:51.333
[Door opens]

01:51.335 --> 01:53.902

a friend here.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.972
I'll leave you two alone.

01:56.974 --> 01:58.440

02:05.950 --> 02:08.616
How do you think?

02:08.619 --> 02:10.252
I'm sure it's been hard.

02:10.253 --> 02:13.589
Look, can we just
get this over with?

02:18.795 --> 02:21.430
Today we're going to talk about
what your testimony will be.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.032
And I'm going to tell you
how our investigation has progressed

02:24.034 --> 02:26.635
to prepare you for
your cross-examination, all right?

02:26.637 --> 02:29.304
All right, let's talk
about the weekend

02:29.306 --> 02:31.073
that you escaped.

02:31.075 --> 02:33.809
What do you remember?

02:33.811 --> 02:36.445
[Exhales]

02:36.447 --> 02:39.314
I remember Ben.

02:39.316 --> 02:40.449
Ben.

02:40.451 --> 02:44.286
When was the last time
that you saw him?

02:44.288 --> 02:46.622
I was over by the window

02:46.624 --> 02:48.991
when they took Ben out.

02:52.629 --> 02:55.697
So you knew that
they were gonna hurt him.

02:55.699 --> 02:58.634
Carrie and I waited
by the door for Ben,

02:58.636 --> 03:01.670
but when they came back,
he wasn't with them.

03:03.940 --> 03:07.109
Do you know what
happened to him?

03:07.111 --> 03:09.311
Yes, I do.

03:16.219 --> 03:17.719

Straighten it out.

03:26.863 --> 03:28.764
This is a lucky man's work.

03:31.668 --> 03:33.435
Dad, what the hell?

03:33.437 --> 03:36.238
What? What--oh,
stop, stop, stop.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.640
Daria: I knew
it would be bad.

03:38.642 --> 03:41.076
Every time I think about it,
I just  want to kill myself.

03:41.078 --> 03:43.979
I should have done
something to stop them.

03:43.981 --> 03:46.411
No, Daria. There's nothing
you could have done.

03:46.436 --> 03:48.251
That was our job.

03:48.252 --> 03:51.920
3 victims have been found
in upstate New York

03:51.922 --> 03:55.057
in a town called Hamilton
over the past 10 days.

03:55.059 --> 03:58.126
All of the bodies were discovered in
a sort of public place,

03:58.128 --> 04:01.129
the first on a dead-end street,
the second in a desolate alley,

04:01.131 --> 04:04.733
and this is the last one--
in a field.

04:04.735 --> 04:07.236
Dorothy, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

04:07.238 --> 04:10.639
Although each victim was abducted
from a neighboring city,

04:10.641 --> 04:12.574
they all have something
in common.

04:12.576 --> 04:13.675
Blake: Yikes.

04:13.677 --> 04:16.378
28 puncture wounds
to the chest in groups of 4.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.046
Looks like it was made
by a 4-pronged hay fork

04:18.048 --> 04:19.815
or some other kind
of farming equipment.

04:19.817 --> 04:21.216
Only the latest victim
was displayed like that.

04:21.218 --> 04:22.818
The first two were
unceremoniously dumped.

04:22.820 --> 04:25.687
The display method and the disposal
suggests the unsub's evolving.

04:25.689 --> 04:27.356
He wanted them to be found.

04:27.358 --> 04:28.724
Perhaps it's some kind
of warning.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.026
It could be a deity symbol.
In a Japanese book

04:31.028 --> 04:33.829
from the year 712
called "Kojiki," the scarecrow is seen

04:33.831 --> 04:36.098
as a symbol of someone
who knew everything in the world.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.899
I'm more concerned
with the M.O.

04:37.901 --> 04:40.002
Is this piqueristic
or flat-out sadistic?

04:40.004 --> 04:43.405
It could be a combo platter,
with a side order of psycho.

04:43.407 --> 04:46.275
His pace and determination mean
he's going to kill again soon.

04:46.277 --> 04:48.210
Let's go to New York.
Wheels up in 30.

04:49.412 --> 04:51.980
After they dumped Ben,
how were they acting?

04:51.982 --> 04:53.649
They were drinking.

04:53.651 --> 04:57.786
They always drank
after they got rid of a body.

04:57.788 --> 04:59.288
[Men laughing]

04:59.290 --> 05:01.290

[Laughter]

05:03.294 --> 05:04.426

05:04.428 --> 05:07.162
What did they do with
you and Carrie after that?

05:07.164 --> 05:09.264
They put us in the shed.

05:09.266 --> 05:12.234
That's when Carrie
had the idea.

05:13.636 --> 05:15.537
We gotta run.

05:16.572 --> 05:18.140
Are you crazy?

05:18.142 --> 05:20.475
They're probably
passed out by now.

05:25.815 --> 05:27.549
No. They're still up.

05:27.551 --> 05:29.418
Then we wait until
they go to bed.

05:29.420 --> 05:31.653

05:32.822 --> 05:34.056

05:34.058 --> 05:35.824
Carrie...

05:35.826 --> 05:39.428
As soon as I get the door open,
we have got to make a run for it.

05:39.430 --> 05:40.924
Daria, Joe is evil.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.790
If we don't do this now,
they're gonna kill us.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.933
You know this.

05:44.935 --> 05:48.570
Daria: We waited two hours,

05:48.572 --> 05:50.972
until we thought
it was safe.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.028
They must have heard
a noise.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.529
That didn't stop us,
though.

Our unsub clearly employs
an abduction method that works

08:19.872 --> 08:21.205
with both men and women.

08:21.207 --> 08:22.873
The female victims had
signs of sexual assault

08:22.875 --> 08:25.876
while the male did not.
That means the rapes are situational.

08:25.878 --> 08:27.645
He also knew where
to stab the victims

08:27.647 --> 08:29.146

08:29.148 --> 08:30.781
Piquerism is usually
sexual in nature,

in mixed gender victimology.

what were you thinking?

What did he do to you?
I need the details, Daria.

09:35.514 --> 09:39.817
He'd punch us so hard,
we couldn't see for a week.

09:39.819 --> 09:43.721
He'd tie us to the radiator.

09:43.723 --> 09:46.924

09:46.926 --> 09:48.859
Help me! Help me!

you could go back to help Carrie.

09:51.430 --> 09:52.730
How could I?

09:52.732 --> 09:54.698
You saw what they did to Ben.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.801
They would have done that to me.

10:05.076 --> 10:07.745
So this is where
Ben was hung.

10:07.747 --> 10:09.413
I don't see any blood.

10:09.415 --> 10:11.015
Crime scene's incredibly neat.

10:11.017 --> 10:13.284
The scarecrow looks like
it was gently placed.

10:13.286 --> 10:15.119
It's quite a distance
from the road, too.

10:15.121 --> 10:18.122
There aren't any tire tracks
to suggest he drove a vehicle out here.

10:18.124 --> 10:19.790
How much do you think
Ben weighed?

10:19.792 --> 10:21.125
A buck 75, maybe.

10:21.127 --> 10:23.661
Ok, so, our unsub
parks his vehicle,

10:23.663 --> 10:26.764
carries a mutilated guy
who's practically dead weight

10:26.766 --> 10:29.767
through a field, strings him up
like a scarecrow,

10:29.769 --> 10:30.901
alone, and no one
sees anything.

10:30.903 --> 10:32.136
I'm not buying.

10:32.138 --> 10:33.304
You think he had help.

10:33.306 --> 10:34.672
He couldn't have
done it alone.

10:34.674 --> 10:36.674
He must've had a partner.

10:47.285 --> 10:50.421
Hey there, Joe, you got
everything you need?

10:50.423 --> 10:51.922
Could be snow, ice.

10:51.924 --> 10:55.326
I got ropes, chains, ammonia to clean up,
and ice picks.

10:55.328 --> 10:57.695
You and your ice picks.
You sure you don't want me to come?

10:57.697 --> 11:00.431
You always take care
of this stuff. I got this one.

11:16.948 --> 11:19.750
Rossi: Were the markings
similar on everyone?

11:19.752 --> 11:23.320
2-millimeter holes,
almost 1.27 centimeters apart.

11:23.322 --> 11:25.422
There are microscopic
differences

11:25.424 --> 11:27.658
in the distances
between the wounds.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.527
This one's
one millimeter shorter.

11:34.966 --> 11:37.334
This is not the work
of a hay fork or a farming implement.

11:37.336 --> 11:39.036
The holes are too small.

11:39.038 --> 11:40.771
I think it's most likely
an ice pick.

11:40.773 --> 11:43.741
So the killers carefully jab the ice pick
into the skin to set the pattern.

11:43.743 --> 11:45.576
Exactly. Then they
replicated it on the other victims.

11:45.578 --> 11:49.313
The unsubs would have had to
stand over the body during the torture.

11:49.315 --> 11:51.015
It's actually quite masterful.

11:51.017 --> 11:53.617
Whoever did this
was extremely controlled.

11:53.619 --> 11:55.152
Add that to the neatness
of the crime scene

11:55.154 --> 11:56.653
and I think we're looking for
someone with OCD.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.322
The precision is astounding.

11:58.324 --> 11:59.823
You guys were right.

11:59.825 --> 12:01.458
Joe was messy.

12:01.460 --> 12:04.395
He made his friend
keep things neat.

12:04.397 --> 12:07.431
Can you give me
an example?

12:07.433 --> 12:10.434
The table was always scrubbed.

12:12.237 --> 12:15.172
The ice picks
were scrubbed, too.

12:16.908 --> 12:21.011
Every drop of blood
was cleaned from the floor.

12:21.013 --> 12:24.081
Every day they would tell us
how they would kill us.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.282
...chop his head off.

12:25.284 --> 12:28.619
They had sick minds.

12:28.621 --> 12:30.254
No.

12:30.256 --> 12:32.289
We could try.

12:32.291 --> 12:36.627
We could. Slice 'em up,
scatter them around town.

12:36.629 --> 12:39.430
No.

12:39.432 --> 12:41.231
I want to do
something freaky.

Really make a statement.

12:43.969 --> 12:46.770
Daria: Sick, hateful minds.

12:46.772 --> 12:50.507
That's probably why we originally
thought this was a hate crime.

12:50.509 --> 12:54.745
I just talked to Ben's sister,
and according to her, he wasn't gay.

12:54.747 --> 12:57.114
We're not looking at another
Matthew Shepard situation.

12:57.116 --> 12:58.182
And the second victim's
parents said

12:58.184 --> 12:59.616
that she was not
a practicing Muslim.

12:59.618 --> 13:02.219
Garcia, have you found any connection
at all between the victims?

13:02.221 --> 13:05.122
They have about as much in common
as dinosaurs and goldfish.

13:05.124 --> 13:06.256
The cracker kind.

13:06.258 --> 13:07.858
Then they might be
victims of opportunity.

She was badly abused.

13:10.129 --> 13:11.462
Where did they find
the body?

13:11.464 --> 13:12.863
Oh, she's not dead.

13:12.865 --> 13:14.765
She got hit by a car last night.
She's been in the E.R.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.500
A cop that had heard about the
chest wounds and made the connection.

Us? Are there other girls?

13:37.022 --> 13:39.289

Give me etomidate.
Let's move back to surgery.

13:54.906 --> 13:56.306
There's another girl.

13:56.308 --> 13:56.992
And she said "they."

13:57.017 --> 13:59.017
Which confirms we were
right about a team.

14:00.312 --> 14:03.447
With one girl escaping,
Carrie's probably in extreme danger.

14:03.449 --> 14:07.551
Or the unsubs are panicking
and they're looking for someone else.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.524
Joe liked bars.

14:13.526 --> 14:15.592
That's usually where
he'd find girls.

14:15.594 --> 14:17.694
Where would he find guys?

14:17.696 --> 14:18.996
Anywhere he could.

14:18.998 --> 14:21.098
But he had a way
with women.

14:24.435 --> 14:26.436
He'd charm us.

I remember doctors,

nothing else.

15:37.462 --> 15:40.095
Our Jane Doe is stable.

15:40.097 --> 15:42.798
She suffered severe trauma
from the car accident

15:42.800 --> 15:44.066
as well as the torture.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.734
There are also signs of
long-term sexual assault.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.137
And wounds on her wrists
that have healed.

15:48.139 --> 15:49.472
So she'd been held
for a while.

15:49.474 --> 15:52.107
Yes. And she's experiencing
retrograde amnesia.

15:52.109 --> 15:53.609
She only remembers snippets
about her past.

15:53.611 --> 15:55.644
Is this from the accident
or the abuse?

15:55.646 --> 15:57.112
Probably a combination
of both.

15:57.114 --> 16:00.149
Time may restore memory.
Questions can jog it.

16:00.151 --> 16:01.684
It's important
that we talk to her.

16:01.686 --> 16:02.751

Nope. I just remember
I was upset.

we need to help you.

16:50.001 --> 16:52.701
You want that, don't you?

17:04.114 --> 17:06.015
We've got to get
her picture out.

17:06.017 --> 17:09.718
I'm just afraid no one's going
to recognize her, she's so beat up.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.487
We'll improvise.
I'll call local P.D.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.289
And get a forensic artist.

17:13.290 --> 17:15.324
Do you think one of
the unsubs is a woman?

17:15.326 --> 17:17.425
She freaked out on me,
not you.

17:17.428 --> 17:19.161
That didn't happen
when she first met you.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.596
But with improving memory,

17:20.598 --> 17:22.397
you may have reminded her
of Carrie.

17:25.068 --> 17:27.069
Yeah, she did
look like Carrie.

17:27.070 --> 17:29.905
Same hair, same smile.

17:29.907 --> 17:32.274
You know, they could
have picked anyone,

17:32.276 --> 17:34.376
but they picked me.

17:34.378 --> 17:36.946
I was going to be
a doctor.

17:36.948 --> 17:38.747
Help people.

17:38.749 --> 17:42.718
Now I got doctors
poking at me all day.

17:45.722 --> 17:49.258
Why did they go from dumping
their victims to displaying them?

17:49.260 --> 17:50.759
I don't know.

17:50.761 --> 17:54.430
Do you think it's because they wanted
the public to see their work?

17:54.432 --> 17:56.432
Why are you asking me that?

17:56.434 --> 17:58.834
Because of how we found
our next victim.

18:00.170 --> 18:03.672
She was discovered hanging
in a rest stop bathroom.

18:06.676 --> 18:08.377
Hotch:
Do we know her name?

18:08.379 --> 18:11.380
Still checking, but our unsubs
are getting bolder.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.949
Their disposal sites
have gone from remote and rural

18:13.951 --> 18:16.418
to high-traffic areas.

18:18.688 --> 18:20.889
Same signature,
but the puncture wounds

18:20.891 --> 18:22.291
are bigger
than the other ones,

18:22.293 --> 18:24.226
and they aren't
the same distance apart.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.061
I think they used
a different ice pick.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.963
The wounds look deeper
and more forceful, too.

18:27.965 --> 18:29.531
They're continuing
to display the bodies,

18:29.533 --> 18:32.534
which means they want
everyone to see their handiwork.

18:32.536 --> 18:36.672
Yet the OCD's not present in the
wound patterns or at the crime scene.

18:36.674 --> 18:38.607
Reid: Maybe they're losing
control and devolving.

18:38.609 --> 18:39.842
Or they know we have Jane Doe

18:39.844 --> 18:42.111
and now their rage
is already out of control.

18:42.113 --> 18:44.546
There are also indicators
of sexual assault.

18:44.548 --> 18:46.749
Let's get that photo
to Morgan and JJ at the hospital.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.685
This could be the Carrie that
the Jane Doe's been going on about.

18:49.687 --> 18:52.354
Morgan: And that's when
I showed you a picture of this woman.

18:52.356 --> 18:54.323
I've never met this woman.

18:54.325 --> 18:55.357
That's not Carrie.

18:55.359 --> 18:56.925
I know. But that's why

18:56.927 --> 18:59.928
we had to get our profile
out fast.

19:01.097 --> 19:03.766
We believe we're looking for a pair
of sadistic killers

19:03.768 --> 19:05.367
who are trying to terrorize
the community by torturing

19:05.369 --> 19:06.935
and displaying
their victims.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.505
One of the partners is dominant
and fulfilling an emotional need.

19:09.507 --> 19:12.741
The other is submissive and displays
obsessive-compulsive tendencies.

19:12.743 --> 19:14.610
We believe the stabbing
in the chest is symbolic

19:14.612 --> 19:16.545
of unfulfilled sexual
desire.

19:16.547 --> 19:19.648
Their M.O. is deteriorating,
and this is evidenced by the fact

19:19.650 --> 19:22.985
that for the first time
a victim successfully escaped.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.238
Blake: So they're improvising
now, breaking their own rules

19:25.263 --> 19:27.157
and becoming even more reckless.

19:27.158 --> 19:29.258
This could cause a rift
in the partnership,

19:29.260 --> 19:32.695
and it may result in changes or escalation
to the torturous behavior.

19:32.697 --> 19:34.930
Now, we do have one
hospitalized victim,

19:34.932 --> 19:36.298
but her abuse
and length of captivity,

19:36.300 --> 19:38.367
along with the injuries
sustained in the car accident,

19:38.369 --> 19:39.868
have left her in
a dissociative state.

19:39.870 --> 19:43.238
At this point, we believe she was held
for at least 10 months,

19:43.240 --> 19:45.607
which is much longer
than any of the other victims.

19:45.609 --> 19:47.643
This means that she held
a very special place

19:47.645 --> 19:49.511
in the dominant unsub's
fantasies.

19:49.513 --> 19:51.480
Losing her will only
increase his anger.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.049
That's why he feels compelled
to display his victims

19:54.051 --> 19:55.918
in a more public way.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.387
He wants others to feel
the full force of his outrage.

19:58.389 --> 20:01.423
Also, since another victim was found
within the last two hours,

20:01.425 --> 20:03.325
we believe the kills
are accelerating.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.684
I could have stopped this.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.619
You did, Daria.

20:30.621 --> 20:31.749
Getting your I.D.

20:31.774 --> 20:33.323
led to a break in the case.
Don't you remember that?

20:33.324 --> 20:34.323
No.

20:34.325 --> 20:35.491
No.

20:35.493 --> 20:36.492
Yes.

20:36.494 --> 20:37.893
Finding out who you were

20:37.895 --> 20:39.695
opened everything up.

20:42.832 --> 20:44.967
This is the area where the bodies
are being dropped.

20:44.969 --> 20:46.435
It's basically
a 10-mile radius.

20:46.437 --> 20:49.238
But the hunting zone
extends another 20 miles.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.739
Probably lives
somewhere in there.

20:50.741 --> 20:51.874

just called from Brooklyn.

our Jane Doe.

a relative now.

20:56.647 --> 20:57.913
What's their relationship?

20:57.915 --> 20:59.615
It's her sister. She's
on the next train up.

20:59.617 --> 21:01.650
About a year ago,

21:01.652 --> 21:04.787
Daria was a med student
at Cornell.

21:04.789 --> 21:08.257
She went to work one day
and just vanished.

21:08.259 --> 21:10.058
We looked everywhere.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.762

you saw her?

21:23.139 --> 21:25.641
I dropped her off at work.

21:25.643 --> 21:28.744
She had a part-time job
at a diner.

hook me up with coffee.

strange about that day?

It was cold.
It was very cold.

21:48.966 --> 21:51.366
When we headed to the door,
we walked by a truck.

21:51.368 --> 21:52.968
Blake: Was there anyone
inside of it?

21:52.970 --> 21:55.504
There was this guy.
A white guy.

21:55.506 --> 21:56.872
Blake: Did he say anything?

21:56.874 --> 21:59.441
He just looked at Daria
and he said...

21:59.443 --> 22:01.109
You're about as pretty
as a stack of new 100s.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.311

22:02.313 --> 22:03.745
He was built.

22:03.747 --> 22:06.081
Probably mid-30s.

22:06.083 --> 22:07.649
Reid: Did your sister
say anything to him?

22:07.651 --> 22:09.084
She smiled back at him.

22:09.086 --> 22:12.254
He told her he was waiting
for his mom who was in...

22:12.256 --> 22:14.356
My mother's in physical therapy
across the street.

22:14.358 --> 22:16.024
Physical therapy
across the street.

22:16.026 --> 22:19.027
Blake: Was there anything
identifiable on the truck?

22:19.029 --> 22:21.530
Bumper stickers.
Decals.

22:21.532 --> 22:23.232
Uh, it was--
it was blue.

22:23.234 --> 22:25.100
Kind of dingy.

22:25.102 --> 22:28.337
Is that all you can see?
Think back.

22:28.339 --> 22:30.973
I can see part
of his license plate.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.476
Uh, 543L...

22:34.478 --> 22:36.979
But I hear a dispatcher.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.313
Reid: What is
the dispatcher saying?

22:38.315 --> 22:40.476
Dispatcher: We got a broken furnace
at Ridley and West.

22:42.352 --> 22:44.419
There was a broken furnace.

22:44.421 --> 22:46.421
Yes.

22:46.423 --> 22:49.558
Yes. There's a Joe Bachner
of Conway Electric.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.728
Pulling up his records now.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.329
Booyah, this is our guy.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.631
What's his background?

22:55.633 --> 22:57.165
He is a member of the upright
citizens brigade,

22:57.167 --> 22:58.634
she says with biting sarcasm.

22:58.636 --> 23:01.103
In and out of jail,
for battery, 15 years ago.

23:01.105 --> 23:04.006
Once accused of kidnapping a woman,
but then she dropped the charges.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.841
We were pretty sure that
Joe was one of our guys,

23:05.843 --> 23:09.211
but we just needed you
to I.D. him to be sure.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.322
Daria?

23:20.324 --> 23:21.790
Daria.

23:21.792 --> 23:22.991
Hmm.

23:22.993 --> 23:24.760
Hey, it's me.

23:24.762 --> 23:28.430
Listen, I need to show you
another picture.

23:28.432 --> 23:31.199
Do you know who this is?

23:33.169 --> 23:34.736
Daria, do you know this man?

23:34.738 --> 23:37.005
[Moans] Get...

23:37.007 --> 23:38.674
Get him away from me.

23:38.676 --> 23:42.277
Get him away from me.

23:42.279 --> 23:45.380
Daria...
Daria, honey.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.616
Honey, I'm here.

23:47.618 --> 23:49.384
You I.D.ing Joe helped
us get his address

23:49.386 --> 23:51.720
and led us straight
to his place.

23:54.490 --> 23:56.158
Yeah...

23:56.160 --> 23:58.427
But you got the story wrong.

23:59.495 --> 24:00.929
How?

24:00.931 --> 24:03.799
That's exactly what you told me
a year ago, Daria.

24:03.801 --> 24:06.234
Yeah, but I remember
more now.

24:07.437 --> 24:11.473
Joe didn't abduct me
in front of the diner.

24:13.076 --> 24:15.444
I got into his truck
willingly.

24:17.113 --> 24:19.014
What are you saying?

24:19.016 --> 24:20.882
He seemed nice.

24:20.884 --> 24:25.420
After work,
Joe took me out for dinner.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.090
The next thing I knew,
I woke up...

24:28.092 --> 24:31.626
in the shed
and I was all--all tied up.

24:31.628 --> 24:35.364
Joe used a ruse.
He did that with everyone.

24:38.801 --> 24:42.471
Did they all
fall in love with him?

24:42.473 --> 24:43.739
No?

24:43.741 --> 24:47.342
That's what I thought.

24:47.344 --> 24:50.245
I liked being there.

24:50.247 --> 24:52.514
I let him touch me

24:52.516 --> 24:56.952
and then I wouldn't get beat.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.021
I kissed him.

24:59.023 --> 25:01.723
I liked it.

25:07.430 --> 25:11.099
It's my fault!

25:11.101 --> 25:13.135
This is all my fault.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.138
[Sobbing]

25:17.507 --> 25:20.008
[Wailing]

25:30.570 --> 25:31.770
Daria just told me

25:31.772 --> 25:34.439
that she got into the car
with Joe voluntarily.

25:34.441 --> 25:36.975
That's all right.
She'll still be a sympathetic witness.

25:36.977 --> 25:38.710
She said she fell in love
with him, Hotch.

25:38.712 --> 25:40.278
We'll explain that it's
Stockholm syndrome,

25:40.280 --> 25:42.380
but I need to know
if there are any more surprises.

25:42.382 --> 25:43.815
All right, I'm about
to go back in there.

25:43.817 --> 25:45.550
I just wanted to
give her a break.

25:45.552 --> 25:48.086
It's critical that we get all the details
of her testimony.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.554
I know.

26:07.206 --> 26:09.274
All right.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.543
Let's get back
to where we were.

26:11.545 --> 26:15.313
Once we got Joe's I.D.,
we headed to the house.

26:28.594 --> 26:30.161
Blake and Reid.

27:07.299 --> 27:08.694
We went out to that house

27:08.719 --> 27:10.537
and we searched the place
and it was empty.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.604
Clear!

27:15.441 --> 27:16.841
Clear!

27:16.843 --> 27:18.109
Clear!

27:18.111 --> 27:19.511
And after we dug deeper
into Joe's background,

27:19.513 --> 27:21.479
we still couldn't figure out
who his partner was.

27:21.481 --> 27:22.547
Nothing out back.

27:22.549 --> 27:24.582
He's burned papers, clothes.

27:24.584 --> 27:27.352
The shed's been completely
ammonia'd down.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.688
Checked the basement.
Clean as a whistle.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.823
Well, if he's not here,
maybe he's with the partner.

27:31.825 --> 27:34.492
Garcia, where else has Joe worked
besides Conway Electric?

27:34.494 --> 27:36.428
He's had random construction
jobs over the last two years.

27:36.430 --> 27:37.996
And what do we know
about his background?

27:37.998 --> 27:39.364
Raised in Pennsylvania.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.899
His parents died
in a car accident.

27:40.901 --> 27:43.101
Rossi: Where'd he go
after that?

27:43.103 --> 27:45.103
His juvie records are sealed
with crazy glue.

27:45.105 --> 27:47.105
But it looks like
he was sent away

27:47.107 --> 27:48.673
to live with his
alcoholic nurse aunt,

27:48.675 --> 27:52.110
who makes Mommy Dearest
look like a Saint.

27:52.112 --> 27:54.345
According to reports,
she locked him in a shed,

27:54.347 --> 27:59.317
didn't feed him for days,
siccing bees on him when she was mad.

27:59.319 --> 28:02.854
Get away! [Screaming]

28:02.856 --> 28:05.757
Please! Stop it!

28:05.759 --> 28:08.727
That's how social services
found him when he got to school.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.062
Hundreds of beestings
on his chest.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.897
So those torture wounds
copied the stings.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.365
It also explains
the display method

28:14.367 --> 28:16.735
of his last two victims.
He wants to show the world the horrors

28:16.737 --> 28:18.703
of what he was forced
to endure as a child.

28:18.705 --> 28:20.739
And Daria was
a medical student.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.441
So we were right.
She's a surrogate for Joe's aunt.

28:23.443 --> 28:25.009
Where's the aunt now?

28:25.011 --> 28:26.811
Uh, she died
February 2012.

28:26.813 --> 28:28.847
A month before
Daria was abducted.

28:28.849 --> 28:30.815
So the aunt's death
was the trigger.

28:30.817 --> 28:32.851
Any known associates?
We need to find the partner.

28:32.853 --> 28:36.087
Looks like he hangs out with
local biker dudes and former cellmates.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.223
Compile a list. We'll run this
by Daria at the hospital.

28:38.225 --> 28:42.393
Yes. Yes. Bad people
make bad people. Bye.

28:42.395 --> 28:45.196
Morgan: You said there was
another man with Joe.

28:45.198 --> 28:46.664
Do you remember that?

28:46.666 --> 28:48.066
I'm not sure.

28:48.068 --> 28:49.534
All right.

28:49.536 --> 28:52.437
You were hesitant
back then, too.

28:55.307 --> 28:57.809
Daria, this is important.

28:57.811 --> 28:59.944
Who else was in that shed?

29:07.253 --> 29:08.953
[Crying]

29:08.955 --> 29:11.556
[Door opens]

29:11.558 --> 29:14.259
[Door closes]

29:14.261 --> 29:17.061
No. No! No!

29:17.063 --> 29:19.898
No, let me go!

29:19.900 --> 29:24.836
No, please!
Please!

29:30.943 --> 29:32.510
Hurry up, Coby!

29:32.512 --> 29:34.078
We don't have all day.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.581
Coby.

29:36.583 --> 29:38.683
His name's Coby.

29:43.689 --> 29:45.657
Oh, God.

29:45.659 --> 29:46.991
It's ok, honey.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.426
You're ok.

29:48.428 --> 29:50.762
I don't want
to do this anymore.

29:50.764 --> 29:52.797
I know.
It was Coby.

29:52.799 --> 29:55.333
I know. Shh.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.603
Shh...

29:58.605 --> 30:01.005
I cross-checked the name Coby
with the guys in the biker gang.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.373
I'm coming up empty there.

30:02.375 --> 30:04.909
Try men released from prison with whom
he might have done time.

30:04.911 --> 30:06.945
Ok...

30:06.947 --> 30:09.447
Bada-bing bada-boom,
the floodgates are opening.

30:09.449 --> 30:11.716
There's a Coby Peters.
He was released a year before Joe.

30:11.718 --> 30:14.319
He lives about 3 miles away.
He's a part-time electrician,

30:14.321 --> 30:15.687
full-time alcoholic.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.388
That's our guy.
Let's go. Thanks, Garcia.

30:22.328 --> 30:24.028
FBI!

30:37.576 --> 30:39.010
Clear!

30:39.012 --> 30:40.011
Clear!

30:40.013 --> 30:42.347
Hotch.

30:42.349 --> 30:44.849
Look. He took
all his guns.

30:44.851 --> 30:46.684
Look at this place.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.022
[Cell phone rings]
This guy's the one with OCD.

30:51.024 --> 30:52.690
Go ahead, Garcia.

30:52.692 --> 30:55.126
Sir, I got a ping
off Coby Peters' credit card.

30:55.128 --> 30:57.028
He's around the corner
at Mike & Sons.

31:01.367 --> 31:04.035
[Brakes screeching]

31:04.037 --> 31:05.670
Coby Peters, FBI!

31:09.742 --> 31:10.742
FBI!

31:10.744 --> 31:12.577
[Siren]

31:12.579 --> 31:14.112
Don't move!

31:31.516 --> 31:33.750
Let's talk about Coby.

31:33.752 --> 31:35.319
Tell me about him.

31:35.321 --> 31:37.955
He was evil.

31:37.957 --> 31:41.358
You must have seen
how mean Coby was.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.460
He wasn't what we expected.

31:43.462 --> 31:45.262
I didn't kill anyone.

31:45.264 --> 31:47.664
We have 4 bodies, Coby.
You're part of a team.

31:47.666 --> 31:49.433
What team?
I'm an electrician.

31:49.435 --> 31:52.336
Who used to be
a medical tech.

31:52.338 --> 31:55.639
Is that how you learned
to torture like this?

31:55.641 --> 31:57.140
What the hell is this?

31:57.142 --> 31:58.976
I thought you brought me
in here for the guns.

31:58.978 --> 32:01.445
We don't care about
the guns. What about Daria?

32:01.447 --> 32:03.480
You know her?

32:06.684 --> 32:07.784
We're getting warmer,
aren't we?

32:07.786 --> 32:08.919
Looks familiar,
doesn't she?

32:08.921 --> 32:10.454
Except you didn't
kill this one,

32:10.456 --> 32:11.922
because she's laying up
in a hospital room

32:11.924 --> 32:13.857
with torture wounds
all over her body.

32:13.859 --> 32:15.158
That's my friend's girl.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.093
Who's your friend?

32:16.095 --> 32:17.928
Joe Bachner.
She come around

32:17.930 --> 32:19.396
when we were playing poker.

32:19.398 --> 32:21.298
What happened to her?
You tell us.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.499
How should I know?

32:22.501 --> 32:23.967
What's your relationship
with your friend?

32:23.969 --> 32:25.769
He's my drinking buddy, and he works
for me from time to time.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.537
When was the last time
you saw him?

32:27.539 --> 32:30.607
I went to his house to give him the keys
to my client's cabin.

32:30.609 --> 32:32.109
Water heater broke.
He said he'd fix it.

32:32.111 --> 32:33.276
Reid: How was he acting?

32:33.278 --> 32:34.978
Fine. He was packing up
his car.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.113
Did he have anyone
with him?

32:36.115 --> 32:38.782
Just some equipment and...

32:40.685 --> 32:42.853
Ice picks.

32:44.589 --> 32:47.824
Look, if Joe hurt these people,
go talk to him.

32:47.826 --> 32:50.460
He's still up
at my client's cabin.

32:52.530 --> 32:53.764
He seems forthcoming.

32:53.766 --> 32:56.600
It could be the behavior
of an innocent or a psychopath.

32:56.602 --> 32:59.469
You know, I know his house was clean,
but did you see his shirt and shoes?

32:59.471 --> 33:01.538
They were messy.
There's no way this guy is OCD.

33:01.540 --> 33:04.908
I find it interesting that Daria
never asked Coby for help.

33:04.910 --> 33:06.510
She was there
when they played poker.

33:06.512 --> 33:08.779
Maybe she couldn't because she
was still under Joe's control.

33:08.781 --> 33:11.281
We searched Coby's home.
Nothing connected to the crime.

33:11.283 --> 33:13.083
Let's head up
to that cabin.

33:23.294 --> 33:25.662
You kids ready
to have some more fun?

33:25.664 --> 33:27.130
Huh? Huh?
Please don't. No!

33:27.132 --> 33:28.331
Aah!

33:28.333 --> 33:29.966
Come on,
just let us go.

33:30.768 --> 33:32.903
Let you go.
Let you go?!

33:32.905 --> 33:35.672
You think I brought you all the way up
here just to let you go?

33:35.674 --> 33:38.241
Joe Bachner, FBI!

33:40.645 --> 33:42.813
Uhh!

33:44.882 --> 33:47.184
We need medics.

33:49.854 --> 33:51.655
You can't outrun
a bullet, Joe!

33:53.991 --> 33:57.561
[Siren]

34:02.433 --> 34:05.335
Tell us where your partner is, Joe.
Who is he?

34:06.537 --> 34:07.804
[Laughing]

34:07.806 --> 34:09.406
Morgan: That's why
I came back to the hospital

34:09.408 --> 34:12.375
to talk to you, because we were trying
to find out who Joe's partner was.

34:12.377 --> 34:17.114
[Ellen talking indistinctly]

34:17.116 --> 34:19.716
Your sister didn't want us
to bother you again,

34:19.717 --> 34:21.384
but she knew
we were desperate.

34:21.386 --> 34:23.887
We're looking for a team and
we have to find both of them.

34:23.889 --> 34:26.356
They could have
more girls right now.

34:26.358 --> 34:27.958
Every minute counts.

34:33.531 --> 34:36.266
Do you remember
what you said?

34:38.969 --> 34:42.105
Yeah. It's coming back.

34:42.107 --> 34:43.306
It was Coby.

34:43.308 --> 34:44.875
Are you sure, Daria?

34:44.877 --> 34:46.243
Yeah, it was him.

34:46.245 --> 34:48.612
I need you to think back.

34:48.614 --> 34:51.214
We were in the shed.
He had an ice pick.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.350
Ok. Ok. And what
was he doing with it?

34:53.351 --> 34:58.355
Joe and Coby were
about to hurt Ben.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.056
And you're sure it was Coby?

35:00.058 --> 35:01.191
Look at his face again.

35:01.193 --> 35:03.493
It's too blurry.
I can't see.

35:03.495 --> 35:05.662
Keep looking, Daria.

35:08.099 --> 35:09.666
[Screaming]

35:09.668 --> 35:12.936
Yeah, it was Coby.
I'm telling you.

35:14.071 --> 35:19.009
He, uh, started
poking holes in Ben.

35:26.584 --> 35:30.153
He put the ice pick
in a box.

35:35.293 --> 35:38.662
Where did they put this box?

35:40.097 --> 35:41.798
On a shelf.

35:43.134 --> 35:45.669
In the house.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.547
Blake?

35:57.549 --> 35:58.982
Yeah, what's up?

35:58.984 --> 36:00.417
I think I figured it out.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.853
Check every shelf
in that house for a wooden box.

36:02.855 --> 36:04.054
What's in the box?

36:04.056 --> 36:06.690
The answer to this case.

36:11.395 --> 36:13.730
So I had Blake
search that house

36:13.732 --> 36:15.899
for that ice pick
in a box,

36:15.901 --> 36:18.001
and then I presented
that box to you.

36:18.003 --> 36:20.503
Is that coming back to you?

36:20.505 --> 36:24.007
Yeah. Yeah.

36:30.781 --> 36:32.148
Is that it?

36:33.251 --> 36:35.352
Yes, it is.

36:35.354 --> 36:37.287
We found it
in Joe's bedroom.

36:37.289 --> 36:40.156
Was the ice pick
in there?

36:40.158 --> 36:43.159
Yes, Daria.

36:43.161 --> 36:45.996
Along with
some of your things.

36:45.998 --> 36:47.664
The reason Joe
hung on to Carrie

36:47.666 --> 36:52.168
is because after you escaped,
he needed another partner.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.303
What?

36:53.305 --> 36:55.238
What are you talking about?

36:58.809 --> 37:00.844
Often when someone's
held captive,

37:00.846 --> 37:03.246
they're forced to do
the unthinkable.

37:08.519 --> 37:11.221
[Daria, indistinct]

37:11.223 --> 37:13.990
Your prints were found
on that ice pick, Daria.

37:13.992 --> 37:15.258
Aah!

37:15.260 --> 37:17.427
I wasn't Coby who put
the holes in those victims.

37:17.429 --> 37:18.762
It was you.

37:20.164 --> 37:22.265
What? You're--you're wrong.

37:22.267 --> 37:23.266
No, I'm not.

37:23.268 --> 37:25.201
Ellen, just listen.
Agent Morgan--

37:25.203 --> 37:26.202
these are facts.

37:26.204 --> 37:28.305
Daria, you're the one
with OCD.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.277
You're the one
who kept that place clean.

37:34.279 --> 37:37.414
Joe forced you to participate.

37:37.416 --> 37:40.717
And he made you clean up
after his crimes.

37:41.953 --> 37:45.755
It's how he controlled you,
Daria.

37:45.757 --> 37:48.925
And to deal with the pain,
your mind had just snapped.

37:48.927 --> 37:51.094
It let you think
that it was someone else

37:51.096 --> 37:52.963
who was participating--
his friend Coby.

37:52.965 --> 37:55.098
It's not true.
It's not true.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.533
I'm sorry, but it is.
No.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.468
It is. He made you do it.

37:58.470 --> 38:00.136
Do it now!

38:00.138 --> 38:02.772
No.

38:02.774 --> 38:05.075
Aah! Aah!

38:05.077 --> 38:07.744
Do it or I'll kill her!

38:07.746 --> 38:09.813
Go on!

38:09.815 --> 38:12.482
Daria, it's not your fault.
No!

38:12.484 --> 38:14.584
Do you hear me?
It's not your fault.

38:14.586 --> 38:15.719
You had no choice.
No!

38:15.721 --> 38:16.820
No!

38:16.822 --> 38:17.754
It's not your fault.

38:17.756 --> 38:19.589
[Screaming]

38:19.591 --> 38:21.157
Daria, baby...

38:21.159 --> 38:24.694
[Screaming]

38:29.600 --> 38:31.935
No! No!

38:31.937 --> 38:35.038
[Screaming, shouting]

39:11.575 --> 39:13.443
I loved him.

39:13.445 --> 39:15.945
That's why
I did those things.

39:21.652 --> 39:24.921
After a while, he didn't even have
to ask me to do it.

39:24.923 --> 39:27.524
I just...I just did it.

39:28.893 --> 39:30.660
Wait a minute.

39:31.896 --> 39:34.831
Did you torture people
on your own?

39:36.267 --> 39:38.668
That's what he wanted.

39:41.238 --> 39:43.039
He loved me.

39:51.682 --> 39:54.751
He kept me
for a whole year.

40:01.258 --> 40:05.195
The other ones he just
had for a few weeks.

40:09.733 --> 40:13.903
Daria, would you hurt
someone again if Joe asked you to?

40:15.473 --> 40:18.208
If he wanted.

40:19.443 --> 40:22.779
He's my boyfriend.

40:22.781 --> 40:25.982
I loved him.

40:25.984 --> 40:28.952
I still love him.

40:34.959 --> 40:38.061
Excuse me, but it's time
for Daria to take her medicine.

40:38.063 --> 40:40.263
Ok.

40:42.032 --> 40:43.700
We're done.

40:50.007 --> 40:52.375
Daria...

40:52.377 --> 40:55.812
I'm gonna step outside
and speak with your sister.

41:03.821 --> 41:06.923
How did it go?

41:06.925 --> 41:09.626
Unfortunately, there is no way
that the government

41:09.628 --> 41:11.261
can call your sister
as a witness.

41:11.263 --> 41:13.296
Wait, what?

41:13.298 --> 41:15.965
That was the deal.
If she doesn't testify,

41:15.967 --> 41:17.100
she goes to jail.

41:17.102 --> 41:19.068
Daria admitted to me
that at some point

41:19.070 --> 41:20.603
she became a willing
participant in the murders,

41:20.605 --> 41:22.305
and she said
she would do it again.

41:22.307 --> 41:23.773
I don't believe that.

41:23.775 --> 41:25.575
Your sister is mentally
incapacitated,

41:25.577 --> 41:28.611
and I am protecting her
by not letting her take that stand.

41:28.613 --> 41:30.446
But then they will
keep her in here forever.

41:30.448 --> 41:32.615
My sister is not crazy.

41:32.617 --> 41:37.220
Ellen, I know you see flashes
of the Daria that you remember,

41:37.222 --> 41:39.189
the strong woman,
the woman who escaped,

41:39.191 --> 41:41.457
and the woman
who wants to get better,

41:41.459 --> 41:44.294
but your sister
is permanently damaged

41:44.296 --> 41:47.030
because of what
he did to her.

41:47.032 --> 41:50.366
This is where
she needs to be.

41:50.368 --> 41:52.869
I am truly sorry.

41:56.941 --> 41:59.375
She just wanted
to say good-bye.

41:59.377 --> 42:01.578
It's time
for therapy now.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.346
So, that's it?

42:03.348 --> 42:05.215
Was I helpful?

42:05.217 --> 42:08.418
Yes, you were.

42:08.420 --> 42:11.921
I have everything
that I need.

42:13.724 --> 42:16.059
You take care, Daria.

42:22.700 --> 42:27.670
Hey. Do you think
you'll ever catch Joe's partner?

42:40.317 --> 42:42.151
I'm not sure.

42:42.153 --> 42:45.488
But we're still looking.

42:45.490 --> 42:48.458
Well, good luck.

42:49.493 --> 42:51.194
Good-bye, Daria.

43:10.848 --> 43:13.583
Morgan: "There are times
when the mind is dealt such a blow,

43:13.585 --> 43:15.752
"it hides itself
in insanity.

43:15.754 --> 43:19.289
"There are times when
reality is nothing but pain.

43:19.291 --> 43:24.627
And to escape that pain,
the mind must leave reality behind."

43:24.629 --> 43:27.597
