WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.251
Go!

00:04.755 --> 00:06.172
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:06.340 --> 00:07.882
You're getting paid.
Three-quarters salary.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.300
Any of us
would take that deal.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.969
How about you, Kelly?
Would you take that deal?

00:12.137 --> 00:13.221
I need something.

00:13.389 --> 00:14.555
The last one.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.265
Yeah.
I mean it.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.975
Didn't we have an agreement
when we first moved in

00:18.143 --> 00:19.268
that we wouldn't get
in each other's business?

00:19.436 --> 00:20.728
This is serious
what you're doing.

00:20.896 --> 00:21.979
I'm not doing anything.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.233
- Is anybody back there?
- Keep walking.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.652
Sweetheart,
do you remember
your Uncle Matt

00:27.820 --> 00:29.654
from Thanksgiving
a couple of years ago?

00:29.822 --> 00:30.905
You're so grown up.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.783
Remember me?
I remember.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.576
Do you wanna have lunch?

00:35.744 --> 00:36.744
You're a good man.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.123
Ready?
Ready.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.499
You sure?
Yeah.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.959
Look at you.

00:43.127 --> 00:45.086
All lit up
like a Christmas tree.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.421
What? No.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.922
I wanted to talk
to you about my brother.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.048
He ain't cut out
for your crew.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.884
You wanna buy-out,
you gotta drop ten K.
I don't have it.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.762
Leon!
Oh, my God, Leon...

00:54.930 --> 00:56.389
What the hell did you do?

01:16.535 --> 01:17.744
Where is he?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.039
Where's Leon?

01:22.207 --> 01:23.207
Where's my money?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.836
Okay, look,

01:27.004 --> 01:28.880
I have a grand, but...

01:34.762 --> 01:35.595
Leon.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.555
Flaco, listen, man,
I...

01:37.723 --> 01:39.891
The deal was
for ten grand, Joe.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.225
I...
I can make payments.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.727
You know
how this works.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.187
I give you a break,

01:44.354 --> 01:46.731
word gets out,
everybody else
wants a break,

01:46.899 --> 01:48.941
and I spend half my day
explaining to people

01:49.109 --> 01:50.485
why they ain't
gonna get one.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.737
So no breaks.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.739
You have the money
or not?

01:59.203 --> 02:00.244
No, I don't.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.917
I, no...

02:07.711 --> 02:08.628
No!

02:11.673 --> 02:13.132
Hey, yeah,
is Renee Royce there?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.760
Leave,
uh... leave what?

02:16.804 --> 02:19.305
Word? Uh, yeah, sure,
yeah, go for it.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.182
Leave word. Thanks.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.194
Good morning, ladies.
Peter Mills,
it's the saddest thing.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.655
The Christmas lights
at the north gate
got blown down.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.031
What?

02:37.199 --> 02:39.659
We are gonna have to do
something about that.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.452
The fireman
that saved Christmas.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.412
Mmm-hmm.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.958
Do you think if I ask him
to my cousin's
Christmas party,

02:47.125 --> 02:49.502
he might take it
the wrong way?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.671
Family functions
are usually reserved
for serious suitors.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.089
So, shouldn't you be
asking Casey?

02:54.591 --> 02:55.591
I just need a date,

02:55.759 --> 02:56.884
so that my cousin doesn't
make any more comments

02:57.052 --> 02:58.094
about how
I'm gonna die alone.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.348
So, you're afraid
Casey'll say no?

03:03.392 --> 03:04.809
Bitch, please.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.439
Hey, hey, Cruz,
you give me a hand here?
In a minute.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.732
Okay.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.611
You said 10 minutes.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.446
Yo, I don't even
want to be here.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.532
Why you calling me?
Come on inside.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.784
What? So a bunch of
fat firemen can make
jokes about my face?

03:23.620 --> 03:25.538
Look, this is
the daily police bulletin.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.039
We get
one of these every day.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.583
That's what "daily"
usually means.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.588
"Expect increased violence
in neighborhood
of Humboldt Park

03:33.755 --> 03:35.798
"due to an escalating
gang conflict."

03:38.176 --> 03:39.802
Leon,

03:39.970 --> 03:42.638
this is some serious
business you're getting
wrapped up in.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.432
I don't know
how else to say it, man.
I'm worried about you.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.144
Then pay Flaco his buyout
and be done with it.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.313
Oh, but you don't got
ten grand, right?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.607
So why are we
still talking?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.609
Look, just keep your nose
out of my business,

03:54.776 --> 03:56.152
before you get
my ass kicked again.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.446
Leon, man.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.780
Leon!

04:02.701 --> 04:03.951
Damn it!

04:09.207 --> 04:12.293
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Ambulance 61.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.088
I was deep frying eggplant.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.214
I turned my back
for a minute,

04:17.382 --> 04:18.341
and there were
flames everywhere.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.134
I tried to beat it out
with a towel,

04:20.302 --> 04:22.678
but I couldn't control it.
Let these two
take care of that hand.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.679
Truck 81
is on the scene.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.059
Ah, turn off
that smoke detector.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.481
All right, let's do
a quick walk-through,

04:33.649 --> 04:35.983
open some more windows,
get this place vented.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.528
Holy moley.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.032
These folks must be
the 1% I keep hearing about.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.660
Carl!
You guys!

04:45.827 --> 04:48.454
This priceless
piece of artwork
has been destroyed.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.667
Oh, wait.
Never mind.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.543
It's supposed
to look like that.

05:05.847 --> 05:06.764
All right?
Thank you.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.516
Probably need
a new counter top,

05:08.684 --> 05:10.142
but everything else
is okay.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.769
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.396
Thank you so much!

05:13.563 --> 05:17.358
Truck 81,
are you available to assist
at a pin-in accident?

05:17.526 --> 05:18.985
Truck 81, responding.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.320
Pack her up.
We got another call.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.120
Come back.
Somebody stop them!

05:29.287 --> 05:30.621
Ma'am,
what's the problem?

05:30.789 --> 05:33.749
My diamond necklace
was sitting right there
on my dresser,

05:33.917 --> 05:35.710
and now it's gone!
And one of those
firemen took it!

06:06.450 --> 06:08.492
Ah...
What's the matter,
Herrmann?

06:10.579 --> 06:11.829
Whoa-ho.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.333
Matthew Casey.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.544
How about that?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.920
What are you
doing here, Griffin?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.922
I'm with Internal Affairs
Division now.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.384
What's the IAD
doing here?
CPD, too.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.510
What the hell's
going on?

06:26.678 --> 06:29.722
Woman on Green Street
says somebody walked off
with her diamond necklace.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.057
What?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.768
This is a joke, right?

06:33.935 --> 06:36.020
No joke, Lieutenant.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.521
My men aren't thieves.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.649
All the same,
we're talking about
$50,000 piece of jewelry.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.778
That's a Class Two felony.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.323
Casey, the police
need to take statements
from you and your men.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.700
And I'm gonna need you
to fill out a Form Two.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.327
Basic stuff...

06:51.495 --> 06:54.038
Where you
worked in the fire,
who you worked with,

06:54.206 --> 06:56.290
if you saw
the missing item,

06:56.458 --> 06:58.876
or anything else
at all suspicious.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.760
Can I have a minute?

07:07.928 --> 07:08.969
Yeah.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.555
I know what
you're going to say.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.934
On my best day,
I'd have to fight the urge
to choke that guy out.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.185
Today is not my best day.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.979
The possible theft
of $50,000 necklace

07:19.147 --> 07:20.439
supersedes any concerns

07:20.607 --> 07:22.983
about your personal feelings
toward Ted Griffin.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.610
Chief, you know
as well as I do,

07:24.778 --> 07:26.862
none of my men
took that necklace.
I hope not.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.782
'Cause I don't want to see
any of them lose their job
and face criminal charges.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.075
And I don't want to see
their lieutenant

07:31.243 --> 07:32.660
get a black mark
on his record.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.162
So let's just
play this by the book.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.793
Good.

07:48.844 --> 07:49.552
Yeah,
stop right here.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.930
Go ahead, lover boy.
Yeah, don't break
her heart, huh?

07:59.354 --> 08:00.938
Never thought
I'd see the day.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.773
Oh, man.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.782
Uh, hey. Um...

08:12.826 --> 08:13.784
Does Renee Royce
live here?

08:14.786 --> 08:17.830
Renee,
there's a fireman
here for you.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.709
Excuse me, gentlemen.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.087
Thanks, Ray. Hi.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.047
Uh, don't mean
to interrupt.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.884
I know you said
you worked at home
on Fridays and...

08:30.051 --> 08:32.720
And you just pictured me
all alone, answering e-mails
in my underwear?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.055
Well, I am now.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.849
Mmm-hmm. Wow.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.602
These are, uh, gorgeous.

08:39.769 --> 08:40.853
Thank you.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.190
How about dinner
tomorrow night?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.567
No interruptions this time,
I promise.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.235
Okay. All right.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.571
Okay.
Okay.

08:50.739 --> 08:51.739
Okay. I'll see you then,
Royce.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.282
Okay, Severide.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.958
Wait.
So, what exactly do you
have against Mills?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.752
Not a thing.
He's adorable.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.670
He's like a harmless
little puppy dog.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.839
Yeah. A puppy dog
with a little wolf blood
in him.

09:10.842 --> 09:11.634
Hey.
What's up, Chief?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.219
Hey, Chief.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.970
Sit.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.766
Uh, Chief.
Is this about the
diamond necklace

09:18.934 --> 09:21.435
Dawson stole
at the residence?
Hey.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.603
Someone from
another shift

09:22.771 --> 09:24.605
apparently just told
your field chief

09:24.773 --> 09:27.149
that, sometime in November,
four units of Toradol

09:27.317 --> 09:30.069
went missing from your rig
during your shift.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.863
What?
Who's saying this?
Hmm?

09:33.031 --> 09:34.365
I bet you
it was Lowell.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.824
Don't you
worry about who said it.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.701
And why are they
waiting until now
to say anything?

09:37.869 --> 09:40.788
That's probably because
they heard IAD was
sniffing around our house.

09:40.956 --> 09:41.664
They didn't want to
catch the blame

09:41.831 --> 09:44.375
if more narcotics
turned up missing.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.335
You know, some junkie
probably stole it off
of the rig

09:46.503 --> 09:48.003
while we were busy
saving his friend.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.797
That may be so.

09:49.965 --> 09:50.839
But it's on you, Dawson.

09:56.179 --> 09:59.723
So, the two of you
knock your heads together,

09:59.891 --> 10:01.600
get back to me
with your official version

10:01.768 --> 10:03.686
about what happened
by the end of shift.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.604
Yeah, we'll figure it out,
Chief.
You better.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.650
Thanks.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.402
You're welcome.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.946
We saved
this lady's house.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.739
So why does she come off
accusing us of stealing...

10:15.907 --> 10:17.783
It's not like
it's without precedent.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.287
Back in the day,
I worked with Pat
"The Pinch" Osbourne.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.289
Had fingers like flypaper.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.666
The roof could be
caving in on us

10:25.834 --> 10:29.878
and Pat
would take a moment to
"rescue" the silverware.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.255
So...

10:32.716 --> 10:34.925
What's the deal
with the lieutenant
and the guy from IAD?

10:35.093 --> 10:38.762
Eh, bad history.
They went through the
academy together

10:38.930 --> 10:41.348
and there was an incident.
What kind of incident?

10:41.516 --> 10:44.476
The kind that ends
with Griffin getting
his face punched in.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.145
Wait. Why'd the
lieutenant hit him?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.814
He was talking trash
about Casey's family.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.942
Uh... but, see...

10:52.902 --> 10:54.278
We don't talk about that.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.823
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
guys, here we go.
Here we go.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.576
Hey, Lieutenant!

11:00.744 --> 11:02.828
Lieutenant,
check this out.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.788
The people
with all the artwork,

11:04.956 --> 11:07.082
Sandra and, uh,
Richard Vaughan,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.335
they're selling their
entire art collection
at auction.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.669
I already finished
my Christmas shopping.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.796
No, no, no,
think about it.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.548
You don't sell
your art collection.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.344
Your children sell
your art collection
after you die. Or...

11:19.262 --> 11:20.763
You sell it
if you need the money.

11:20.930 --> 11:21.847
Otis, I have
things to do, so...

11:22.015 --> 11:24.350
The diamond necklace,
it's an insurance scam.

11:26.478 --> 11:30.105
So, this woman nearly
burned down her home

11:30.273 --> 11:32.649
in some elaborate scheme
to get firefighters
in there,

11:32.817 --> 11:34.693
so she could accuse them
of stealing a necklace.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.653
No, she didn't
set the fire.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.906
But, when it happened,

11:39.074 --> 11:41.200
she saw an opportunity
to cash it.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.036
Yeah. You should
write that down.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.373
Okay, I will.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.126
All right...

11:51.294 --> 11:53.670
Look, Shay,
your ride's here.
...there you go. Thanks.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.048
Great.
Yeah.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.508
You going
to the prom, Herrmann?

11:57.675 --> 11:58.550
Hey.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.428
This is the flagship
for Caesar Limousine,

12:01.596 --> 12:02.554
"Your chariot awaits, ma'am."

12:02.722 --> 12:04.723
Oh-ho-ho.
This guy...

12:05.600 --> 12:06.600
He's liquidating his company.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.727
And I can only afford
one vehicle to start,

12:08.895 --> 12:10.687
but I figure,
I roll the profits
into this one,

12:10.855 --> 12:13.565
and then into the next,
and then the next,
and before you know it,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.567
I'm gonna have
a whole fleet.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.653
Airport runs,
weddings, prom season...

12:17.821 --> 12:18.821
Really, Herrmann?

12:18.988 --> 12:22.699
Hey. I was smart enough
to bring my own mechanic
to the negotiations.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.245
Severide
got the guy to knock
$1,500 off the price.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.206
You're gonna have to spend
some of that money
to fix this charging issue.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.542
And you definitely
need to replace
the timing belt.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.173
And I thought I replaced
every vial I gave you,

12:38.341 --> 12:40.217
but, unless
I lost count...
Hey.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.553
How can they bust you
for something

12:42.720 --> 12:43.637
that somebody said
happened a month ago?

12:43.805 --> 12:44.763
It's their word
against yours.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.640
If it was
my ass on the line,
I'd put up a fight.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.476
But Dawson is the PIC.
It's her ass on the line.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.854
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.776
No, you're right.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.612
It's not your problem.
You got what you needed.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.199
That... Shay...

13:04.367 --> 13:06.660
Shay.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.830
Ambulance 61, Truck 81...

13:09.998 --> 13:12.624
Capp, move this thing,
will you?
Right.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.929
Yes!

13:26.097 --> 13:27.806
Reports of
multiple gunshot victims...
Got it!

13:27.974 --> 13:30.809
Humboldt Park.
Humboldt Park.
As predicted.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.876
Everybody back up!
Give 'em some room!

13:56.044 --> 13:57.544
Hey, Shay, let's get
a C collar on her,

13:57.712 --> 14:00.130
get her back in the ambo'
and start an I.V.
It's just the one?

14:00.298 --> 14:01.798
The other two are DOA.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.550
It was a drive-by
vehicle to vehicle.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.093
Girl was hit by a stray.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.970
Shooters are long gone.
We'll check these two
just in case.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.680
I'm on it, Lieutenant.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.708
- What color was it?
- The car, what color?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.794
Was it an SUV,
a Sedan, what?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.838
Hey, come on, man,
my partner heard you say
you saw the other car.

14:42.006 --> 14:42.923
Not really.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.509
I mean, it all happened
so fast, man.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.656
Yo.
"Yo." Leon,

15:07.824 --> 15:09.658
I left you like
four messages.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.618
Busy day.
Yeah, no kidding.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.954
We just got a call
on a drive-by
on Augusta and Pulaski

15:14.122 --> 15:16.123
and your boy Flaco
was behind it.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.418
Yo, can I call you later?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.379
Are you with them
right now?

15:22.547 --> 15:23.839
Mmm-hmm.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.509
It don't matter.
I'm gonna do the talking.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.345
There's gonna be
retaliation, Leon.
And I know you know that.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.639
You gotta put some daylight
between you and Flaco.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.106
Listen, Leon,

15:43.443 --> 15:46.695
I know you think you don't
have a way out of this life,
but you do.

15:46.863 --> 15:47.904
I can help you.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.657
Not right...
Not right this minute, but...

15:50.825 --> 15:52.701
But I can help you get out.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.828
Just say the word.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.247
You want my help,
just say so.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.629
"So."

16:08.301 --> 16:09.760
There you go, sweetie.
Get in there.
Have a seat.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.012
You're gonna catch
a cold out here.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.351
Okay, James,

16:17.518 --> 16:18.894
I'm gonna take
your blood pressure,
is that okay?

16:19.062 --> 16:20.312
Will it hurt?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.148
I do it every time,
and you always ask me
if it's gonna hurt.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.399
You never know.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.111
I don't know.
It's just too soon
to ask Casey.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.114
This isn't the first time
his relationship with Hallie
flat-lined.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.491
If it somehow
gets revived again

16:32.659 --> 16:34.993
and she finds out that
I asked him on a date...

16:35.161 --> 16:37.079
Won't you regret it
if you don't ask him,
though?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
It's gotta be Mills.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.500
He's just the more
appropriate choice.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.002
I guess you're right.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.254
Oh, for your dress,
there's this new shop
on Damen...

16:46.422 --> 16:48.715
No way.
I sprained my credit card
Christmas shopping.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.134
I'll just recycle
something.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.886
Oh! One-ten over 60.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.472
James, you're
like a triathlete!

16:55.640 --> 16:56.598
You're good to go,
sweetie.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.266
We'll take you in
and get you your
meds, okay?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.769
Oh, James,
that reminds me.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.729
Did you steal any Toradol
from us last month?

17:04.482 --> 17:05.649
I'm totally kidding.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.698
Give me a minute.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.334
Quick question.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.169
Saturday.
What are you doing?

17:27.255 --> 17:28.672
Depends.
What do you got?

17:28.840 --> 17:30.173
Um, my cousin,

17:30.341 --> 17:32.300
the poster child for
Better Homes and Gardens

17:32.468 --> 17:34.761
throws this real super-fancy
Christmas party every year.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.596
It's a string quartet,
plum pudding,

17:36.764 --> 17:39.015
nutmeg sprinkled
over the eggnog,

17:39.183 --> 17:40.600
so perfect,
you want to vomit.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.395
Sounds awesome.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.147
And you need a date?
Yeah.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.692
I mean,
I just need a friend
to bring along, really.

17:48.860 --> 17:49.693
Oh.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.028
Then maybe
you should ask Mouch.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.575
If you're up for a date,

17:56.743 --> 17:57.951
tell me what time
to pick you up.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.537
Seven o'clock?

18:01.622 --> 18:02.748
Great.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.089
Yeah, I need a new dress.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.760
Chief, are you just gonna
let these pretend cops
violate our civil rights?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.803
Yeah, don't they
need to show us
a warrant or something?

18:16.971 --> 18:19.598
They are well within
their authority to search
firehouse property.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.016
Even our personal lockers?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.059
You mean
the department's lockers.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.478
Besides,

18:24.645 --> 18:26.855
it shouldn't bother you
if you're not
hiding something.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.566
Griffin, can I have
a moment with you?

18:29.734 --> 18:31.735
Locker room, guys.
Come on.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.952
What?
You wanna punch me again?

18:42.163 --> 18:44.706
When's the last time IAD
searched an entire house?

18:44.874 --> 18:47.709
A firefighter stole
a $50,000 necklace,

18:47.877 --> 18:49.753
and it's my job
to find out who.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.505
But don't blame me
if you suddenly regret

18:51.672 --> 18:53.048
assaulting
a fellow classmate.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.842
Regret it?
I'm glad I did it.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.678
You weren't the first idiot
to make a crack
about my family,

18:58.846 --> 19:00.472
you're the last.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.682
No one's brought it up again
since I laid your ass out.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.226
Sucker-punched.
You saw it coming.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.728
The only ones who saw it
were your buddies,

19:06.896 --> 19:07.979
none of whom
had the integrity

19:08.147 --> 19:09.314
to say
what really happened.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.029
By the way,
how is your mom?

19:19.075 --> 19:20.659
Hey! Hey!

19:20.827 --> 19:23.036
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.830
Casey blood sure runs hot,
don't it?

19:25.957 --> 19:26.998
Do your job.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.467
Remember that
one call we went on
at the university?

19:37.635 --> 19:38.969
Which one?
We got a block away

19:39.136 --> 19:41.096
and we realized
the jump bag was
sitting on the curb?

19:41.264 --> 19:43.014
I think that's when
the vials went missing.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.394
Damn, girl.
You wear that dress,
I'll be your date.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.895
I don't know.
I feel kind of naked.

19:49.772 --> 19:50.730
It's perfect.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.482
Excuse me.
Ring this up.

19:52.650 --> 19:56.444
Oh, no. I need to think
about this one
for a minute, thank you.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.614
Is everything okay?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.116
Yeah. Why?

20:01.284 --> 20:04.077
You seem more worked up
over this Toradol thing
than I am.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.162
No, I'm not worried.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.582
Ambo' 61,
what's your location?

20:08.749 --> 20:10.542
Ambulance 61, we're at
Armitage and Damen.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.711
Take in a working fire,
1100 block North Hamlin.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.045
Um... okay.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.714
I'll take
the other one.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.137
Engine 51.
Truck 81, Squad 3...

20:22.305 --> 20:23.305
Hey, let's go.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.056
Battalion 25, Ambulance 61.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.309
House Fire.
1100 Block, North Hamlin.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.227
Hey, this house
was supposed to be
taken out of service.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.854
You never
made that request.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.065
So now you guys
are gonna have to
sit tight

20:35.776 --> 20:37.444
until these men get back.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.699
That address
is at Humboldt Park
again, isn't it?

21:05.723 --> 21:08.600
This is Battalion Chief Boden
at 1140 North Hamlin.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.728
We responded to a call
of a gang shooting
into the building.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.647
They torched it and fled
before we got here.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.149
Who's inside,
another gang?
Any civilians?

21:16.317 --> 21:17.692
You know as much as I do.

21:17.860 --> 21:18.902
Could be gang
members inside.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.278
I count six mailboxes.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.696
That fire has
reached its structure.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.200
Mouch, Otis,
on the aerial,

21:25.368 --> 21:26.534
get ready
to vent the roof.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.787
Herrmann, Mills, Cruz,

21:28.955 --> 21:29.955
with me.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.581
Be careful.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.258
Clear! Clear!

21:42.426 --> 21:43.551
Get away, Herrmann!

21:43.719 --> 21:45.553
This is the Chicago
Fire Department!

21:45.721 --> 21:47.973
Lay down your weapons!
We're trying to help you!

21:51.477 --> 21:53.937
Cruz!
No somos los policias!

21:54.105 --> 21:56.773
We're not police!
You're gonna die
if you stay in there!

21:56.941 --> 21:58.692
Let us help you!

22:00.319 --> 22:02.070
I'm coming in!
Don't shoot!
Cruz!

22:03.072 --> 22:04.447
Cruz!

22:04.615 --> 22:06.366
Don't shoot!

22:11.706 --> 22:12.622
You the Kings?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.251
Insane Kings?

22:16.419 --> 22:17.877
I'm Leon's brother.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.588
Where is he?
Where is he?
No, where is he?

22:21.799 --> 22:23.049
Catch the shooter!

22:23.217 --> 22:25.093
Come here, you punk!
You're lucky...

22:28.347 --> 22:30.890
Hey, we're in!
Let's go!
Take the infrared.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.143
Mills, catch up with Cruz.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.686
Herrmann,
are you okay?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.104
I'm gonna crack those punks
upside their head...

22:36.272 --> 22:37.731
No, you're gonna
sit this one out.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.566
Severide?
Let's go.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.073
Here you go.
Put your helmet on.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.575
You're doing fine.
Keep going.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.744
Come on,
just take it easy.
You're almost there.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.620
All right,
here we go.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.788
Hey!
Somebody take this guy!

22:53.956 --> 22:54.998
I got it.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.459
We got ya!
Shay! Dawson!
Here you go...

22:57.626 --> 23:00.086
We'll do
a right-hand search
and vent as we go.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.963
Help us!

23:02.131 --> 23:04.174
You got
a woman and her kid
on the second floor,

23:04.341 --> 23:05.550
front side.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.636
We'll get them!

23:08.804 --> 23:10.847
Help us!

23:12.725 --> 23:15.101
Fire Department.
Call out!

23:15.269 --> 23:16.770
Help!

23:19.356 --> 23:20.607
Help us!

23:22.777 --> 23:24.819
Let's go.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.447
My little one,
I don't know where he is.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.157
Severide'll find him,
but we need to go.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.617
You don't understand,
I need to find him.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.494
Ma'am, we need to go
right now.

23:32.661 --> 23:33.828
Flaco!

23:33.996 --> 23:35.580
Hello!
Anybody in here?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.082
Anybody in here?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.459
All clear!
Clear!

23:39.627 --> 23:41.211
Come on,
come on, buddy.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.046
Please.
We're gonna find him.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.923
Flaco! Flaco!
Ma'am!

23:45.091 --> 23:46.299
I got him!

23:51.388 --> 23:52.972
Get this guy
out of here!

23:53.140 --> 23:54.724
Cruz, hold off!
I'll be back!

23:54.892 --> 23:58.728
Come on, buddy! Up!
I got you.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.439
Fire department!
Clear the door!

24:03.150 --> 24:05.693
Anybody in here?
Call out!

24:13.994 --> 24:15.203
Come on.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.835
We've got two minors,
smoke inhalation.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.170
- Get 'em to the ambulance.
- Let's go.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.589
What do we got?
First and second floor
are clear!

24:26.757 --> 24:28.633
- My legs...
- Watch your step here.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.599
Mills?
Where's Cruz?
Yeah.

24:36.767 --> 24:38.643
He's still up there.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.895
This is Cruz on three!
All clear!

24:41.063 --> 24:42.605
Headed up to four now!

24:42.773 --> 24:45.150
Cruz, wait for me.
I'm coming up.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.796
Get away from the door!

25:07.882 --> 25:10.133
Fire department,
call out!

25:10.301 --> 25:12.135
Leon!

25:15.514 --> 25:16.806
Leon!

25:19.894 --> 25:23.021
Thank God.
Joe, help me!

25:27.276 --> 25:28.610
Help me.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.245
Please!

25:45.336 --> 25:46.544
Joe!

26:03.646 --> 26:05.063
This is Cruz, up top.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.857
All clear.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.792
Hell of a job
you did out there, Joe.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.087
Hey...

26:29.922 --> 26:31.422
We missed one.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.050
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.386
If you hadn't gotten us
through that gunmen,

26:36.553 --> 26:38.680
we might have
missed them all.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.367
Casey, hey,
you're not gonna
believe this.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.328
So I ordered a
background check on Sandra
and Richard Vaughan.

27:02.496 --> 27:05.290
Otis, I...
They are leveraged
up to their eyeballs.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.916
It's one judgment
after the next.

27:07.084 --> 27:09.252
They're staving off
bankruptcy.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.130
They're in financial ruin.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.881
And Mr. Vaughan?

27:14.049 --> 27:16.217
Investigated twice
for wire fraud.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.013
Two hundred and
thirty-six subscribers

27:20.180 --> 27:22.640
are gonna hear about this
on my next podcast.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.062
Oh, Lieutenant Casey.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.314
Four-hour call, huh?

27:29.481 --> 27:30.690
That was pretty convenient.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.525
It's insurance fraud.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.445
The woman
with the diamonds,
they're broke.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.906
What do you do off-shift,
drive around in a van,
solving mysteries?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.709
Ah.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.340
Lieutenant Casey,

27:56.508 --> 27:57.633
you're up.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.470
What is it you're
hoping for, Griffin?

28:00.637 --> 28:02.221
Toss the room.
Search him.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.307
Seriously?
Come on.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.813
It's all yours.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.453
It was extremely
careless on our part.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.663
You leave a bag
full of medication

28:27.831 --> 28:29.916
on a curb
at a college campus,

28:30.084 --> 28:31.751
you're asking
for trouble.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.340
And you're going to be
so much more careful
in the future, right?

28:37.508 --> 28:39.801
Yes, sir.
Absolutely, Chief.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.094
Hmm.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.429
Okay.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.557
Just write down
what you told me,

28:46.725 --> 28:49.435
don't sign anywhere
until you bring these back.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.521
Because I have to witness
your signatures.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.356
If you'd like Mouch
to go over it with you

28:53.524 --> 28:55.608
as your
union representative,
you do have that right.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.944
You want us
to sign it in blood,
or will blue ink suffice?

28:58.112 --> 28:59.695
Don't you drag
your heels now.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.490
No. We'll get it
right back to you, Chief.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.158
Shay.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.701
One moment.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.125
What is it, Chief?

29:32.521 --> 29:33.521
Nothing.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.315
Go on.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.897
Skinny margarita.
What?

30:16.064 --> 30:18.858
Skinny on the calories,
not the alcohol.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.651
Ah, ah.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.739
You have
a really nice place.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.824
Mmm. Thank you.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.951
I guess it pays to work in...

30:29.786 --> 30:31.370
Foreign financial...

30:31.538 --> 30:33.456
International finance law.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.124
Yes, it does.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.460
But I want to
hear about you

30:37.628 --> 30:39.545
and how you fight fires
every day.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.047
It's not every day.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.798
We're on 24, off 48.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.008
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.801
I didn't know that.
Uh-huh.

30:45.969 --> 30:49.722
And then,
what do you like to do
on your off days?

30:49.890 --> 30:52.308
I repair boats,
up near Monroe Harbor.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.562
Um, do you go out
to the lake much?

30:56.730 --> 30:58.814
Yeah, more in the summers,
but...

30:58.982 --> 31:00.358
Mmm.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.817
I haven't been out
in a while.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.611
I'll take you some time.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.906
Oh, will you now?

31:07.074 --> 31:09.033
Any time you want, Royce.
Just say the word.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.327
Hmm.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.330
What?

31:17.793 --> 31:18.876
Who was she?

31:20.671 --> 31:21.671
What do you mean?

31:21.838 --> 31:23.714
The Renee
that ruined my name.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.930
She was my fiancée.

31:53.704 --> 31:56.581
Evening, ma'am.
Can I help you?

31:56.748 --> 32:01.669
I just wanted to apologize
on behalf of Truck 81
for your missing item,

32:01.837 --> 32:04.130
and to let you know,
we're gonna get
to the bottom of it.

32:04.298 --> 32:05.673
Well, I should hope so.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.344
This is a thermal
imaging camera.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.597
It's a really great
piece of technology,

32:12.764 --> 32:14.724
helps us see through
the thickest smoke.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.810
Okay.
We all carry them,

32:17.978 --> 32:20.563
and we leave them recording
the whole time
we're on a call.

32:20.731 --> 32:23.733
I'm actually on my way
to drop all our cameras
off with the police,

32:23.900 --> 32:25.651
so they can
review the footage

32:25.819 --> 32:27.653
and see exactly
what happened
the entire time

32:27.821 --> 32:29.739
my men and I
were inside your home.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.242
So, don't worry.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.704
Okay.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.080
Is that it?

32:39.082 --> 32:40.124
Yeah.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.376
Great.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.420
So maybe
you should leave now.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.437
Son, you're a slob.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.898
Got something.

33:04.066 --> 33:07.109
Oh, yeah.
Give me that,
give me that.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.406
Oh, false alarm.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.533
Just an adorable pair
of kitty-kat cuff links.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.870
It's the Maneki-neko,
a Japanese good luck charm.

33:18.038 --> 33:21.540
And those were
a Christmas gift,
if you don't mind.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.542
Hey, domo arigato,
Mr. Roboto.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.169
That doesn't even
make sense.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.839
Chief Boden, have you
been able to locate
Lieutenant Casey?

33:29.007 --> 33:30.257
I'm right here.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.723
Griffin.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.976
Is that a fact?

33:41.853 --> 33:43.479
That's very interesting.

33:43.647 --> 33:44.980
No, thank you.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.736
The diamond
slipped down into a heat
register, apparently.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.697
Mrs. Vaughan
just found them.

33:52.864 --> 33:53.698
You gotta be kidding me.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.158
What a surprise.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.285
Less paperwork for me.
Hallelujah. Let's go.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.624
Do say hi
to your Mom for me.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.584
Door's that way.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.342
All right,
so what'd you do?

34:14.302 --> 34:15.594
Nothing.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.556
I just told her
we recorded the whole thing

34:18.724 --> 34:20.725
on our thermal cameras,
you know?

34:21.643 --> 34:24.145
Wait, thermal cameras
don't record.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.479
Oh.

34:27.274 --> 34:30.192
Oh... that's good.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.694
Ooh.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.823
Casey,
you have a visitor
in the briefing room.

34:42.372 --> 34:43.539
Chris.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.708
This is a nice surprise.

34:45.876 --> 34:47.001
Merry Christmas.

34:47.169 --> 34:49.670
Yeah, Matt.
Merry Christmas.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.339
Almost done shopping.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.342
I couldn't remember
if you were large
or extra-large,

34:55.510 --> 34:57.094
but there's a gift
receipt in there.

34:57.262 --> 35:00.347
Oh, that's really sweet.
Thank you.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.478
Since we saw you
at the cemetery,

35:06.521 --> 35:09.148
Violet's been
pretty flipped out.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.984
"Why doesn't Uncle Matt
ever come see us?"

35:12.152 --> 35:14.069
"Does he not like us?

35:14.237 --> 35:15.613
"Do you not like him?"

35:16.615 --> 35:19.784
And she shouldn't
have to be asking
those questions.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.037
And...

35:23.205 --> 35:24.914
That's on you and me.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.793
Absolutely it is. Yeah.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.712
I feel like she's been
without her uncle and...

35:33.548 --> 35:35.925
I've been without
my brother for too long.
Yeah.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.094
I want nothing more
than for us to be
in each other's lives.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.430
But the last time
we talked about it...
I know.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.224
I remember
the conversation.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.231
So you're still
defending her?

35:51.858 --> 35:53.734
I'm not gonna turn
my back on her.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.781
Don't you miss dad?

36:04.454 --> 36:05.704
Yeah, but it's something
I...

36:05.872 --> 36:07.957
Excuse me one second.
I need to steal him.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.124
Bye.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.796
Drink?
Oh, thank you.

36:15.757 --> 36:18.133
Oh, I can't wait
to show you this room.
Okay.

36:20.011 --> 36:20.845
Ooh.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.601
Wow.
It's nice, right?

36:27.769 --> 36:28.853
Yeah.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.647
Oh, and hey, I promise,

36:31.815 --> 36:34.066
I won't let my aunt
corner you again like that.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.693
I'm sorry.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.820
It's okay,
she's... she's fun.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.405
Yeah, she's better
when you're drunk.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.661
Oh, better learn
how to keep up,
buddy boy.

36:45.829 --> 36:47.746
Yeah.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.001
I mean...

36:53.253 --> 36:55.045
Are we just here
as friends, or...

36:57.507 --> 36:58.924
Is this a date?

37:11.271 --> 37:13.314
I can't. I...
No, I get it.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.524
It's not a good time.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.861
Because
it's worth doing right.

37:22.324 --> 37:23.532
Right?

37:26.036 --> 37:27.828
Oops, sorry.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.247
Don't mind us.

37:32.459 --> 37:33.834
Uh, are you ready
for dessert?

37:34.002 --> 37:35.753
I'm ready, for dessert.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.009
This is crazy, bro.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.762
I was just up there
like ten minutes
before it all went down.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.558
Flaco sent me to get Shorty,
otherwise, I don't know.

37:51.811 --> 37:54.313
Somebody's gotta be up there
looking out for me.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.945
Joe, you okay?

38:02.864 --> 38:04.073
I can't.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.954
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I...

38:26.012 --> 38:27.638
You're up early.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.065
You know I love you, right?

38:39.192 --> 38:40.943
Okay, what's going on?

38:43.697 --> 38:45.739
I love you because
I know you'd stick
your neck out for me

38:45.907 --> 38:46.949
the way I have for you.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.118
Of course I would.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.537
And I did that
to get you
over the hump.

38:51.705 --> 38:53.330
Which you totally did.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.543
And then
I found these
in the trash.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.297
Those are... they're old.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.885
I perjured myself
for you, Kelly.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.430
Shay...

39:10.765 --> 39:11.640
I'm out.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what do you mean?

39:14.811 --> 39:16.520
I mean, I'm out!

39:16.688 --> 39:18.313
We had a deal,

39:18.481 --> 39:19.523
we wouldn't get in
each other's business.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.608
But I can't
hold up my end.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.570
So, I'm out.
Shay, it's okay.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.447
I got it.
I got it.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.490
No! You don't "got it"!

39:29.492 --> 39:32.661
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you...

39:33.830 --> 39:35.706
Fool yourself.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.794
I'll get the rest
of my stuff later.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.464
Shay, hey,
please don't go.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.549
Please don't...
Please don't do this.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.783
This is Matt Casey.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.159
Leave it here
and I'll call you back.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.370
Lieutenant, it's Joe Cruz.
Um...

40:16.915 --> 40:18.749
Casey, man,
I need to talk to you.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.505
It's really important.
I, uh...

40:28.218 --> 40:29.843
I, um...

40:43.983 --> 40:45.067
Here you go.
I'll make my brother

40:45.235 --> 40:46.985
get the rest of your stuff
tomorrow.

40:47.153 --> 40:50.239
And you are totally
welcome to stay with me
as long as you want.

40:50.406 --> 40:51.657
Thanks.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.743
You gonna tell me
what he did?

40:55.829 --> 40:58.956
No. You gonna tell me
how your date went?

40:59.124 --> 41:01.542
Nope. He's good.

41:02.502 --> 41:03.919
Thank you.

41:04.754 --> 41:06.588
Okay, man...

41:06.756 --> 41:09.424
Come on,
give me something.
Okay.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.135
Well, I was
right about Casey.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.803
He's still into Hallie.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.888
And, I'm an idiot.

41:35.702 --> 41:36.827
Hi, Mom.

41:41.875 --> 41:44.376
Tomorrow night,
you and me are gonna
have a few margaritas.

41:44.544 --> 41:46.712
A few pitchers, you mean.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.088
Yeah.
