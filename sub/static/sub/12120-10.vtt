WEBVTT

00:54.090 --> 00:56.090
Damn it. Damn it. Oh.

00:57.010 --> 00:58.430
How'd it go?

00:58.510 --> 00:59.850
It's Grace.

00:59.930 --> 01:01.720
I know. That's why I said, "How'd it go?"

01:01.810 --> 01:04.140
Well, you really should say "Hello" first.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.600
-OK, call me back.
-No, Frankie!

01:07.690 --> 01:09.650
How did it go with Phil?

01:09.730 --> 01:13.030
I-- It-- went--
Better than I thought.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.240
-That's it?
<i>-I'll tell you everything tomorrow.</i>

01:16.320 --> 01:20.620
Listen, um...
I have to spend the night at Mallory's.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.790
-Oh, no. Is she back on bed rest?
<i>-No, no, no. She's fine.</i>

01:23.870 --> 01:28.130
But, um, Mitch is out of town and, um,
she needs help with the kids.

01:28.210 --> 01:29.210
Uh, how are you?

01:29.290 --> 01:34.050
<i>- How-How'd it go with Krystle?</i>
- Fine. Not bad.

01:34.130 --> 01:35.970
-Bad.
-Oh, boy.

01:36.050 --> 01:39.350
Yeah. If you want to stop at Del Taco
on your way home tomorrow

01:39.430 --> 01:42.850
and get me a Veggie Works Burrito,
I wouldn't punch you in the face.

01:42.930 --> 01:45.270
Well, I'd hope you wouldn't
punch me in the face either way.

01:45.350 --> 01:47.600
-Listen, I gotta go.
-Oh, OK, but wait, wait,

01:47.690 --> 01:50.610
-I have a Brianna question.
<i>-Oh, that's right.</i>

01:50.690 --> 01:51.690
<i>When's your meeting with her?</i>

01:51.770 --> 01:54.190
Uh, tomorrow.
I've gotta have the perfect gift.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.860
The only gift I ever gave her
that she liked was a Volkswagen Jetta.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.830
No, I'm thinking more along the lines
of a dime bag or cheeses of the world.

02:01.910 --> 02:05.080
Just present your case.
No theatrics. Just the facts.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.250
Oh, I'm gonna fact her brains out.

02:07.330 --> 02:09.710
I have a whole presentation
I've been working on.

02:09.789 --> 02:11.790
<i>She's gonna forget</i>
<i>she ever heard of palm oil</i>

02:11.880 --> 02:13.800
and she's gonna remember
how much she loves me.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.760
<i>Yeah, well, I hope she does.</i>

02:15.840 --> 02:19.010
Hey, listen, I'm, uh, I'm in front
of Mallory's now. I gotta go.

02:19.090 --> 02:22.220
OK, bye. Oh, don't forget
my Del Taco on the way ho--

02:53.000 --> 02:55.670
I was starting to think you weren't
gonna show up again.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.840
Oh, I try not to make
the same mistake twice.

03:05.430 --> 03:09.100
Poor Augie.
I think he hates exercise more than I do.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.690
Oh, we can make it home. Really.

03:11.770 --> 03:15.400
Oh, no. I shall not be responsible
for the dehydration

03:15.480 --> 03:17.570
of the friendliest dog in America.

03:17.650 --> 03:18.950
Is tap OK?

03:19.030 --> 03:21.700
Toilets are OK.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.240
Robert!

03:23.320 --> 03:25.080
Oh, dear God, no.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.160
Yes?

03:30.330 --> 03:31.620
What is going on?

03:31.710 --> 03:34.040
You seem to have mistaken once again

03:34.130 --> 03:37.170
a closed door as an invitation
to enter this house.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.800
Why was it closed?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.510
Well, we'd have to go back in time

03:40.590 --> 03:44.300
to the invention of structures
with doors around 800 B.C.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.470
Something about avoiding plague.
Speaking of which, why are you here?

03:48.560 --> 03:51.480
Uh-uh, why is he here?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.480
Do you know he's still married?

03:53.560 --> 03:56.190
-I do, actually.
-I am not talking to you!

03:56.270 --> 04:00.190
Sol, my friend is here to give his dog,
Augie, full name:

04:00.280 --> 04:04.030
Augie-Augie-Oxen-Free,
a drink of water and that is all.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.910
Is he a new friend?

04:05.990 --> 04:07.790
He's a none-of-your-business friend.

04:07.870 --> 04:11.040
You think I don't know
what goes on at that dog park?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.960
-Have you been stalking me?
-No!

04:13.040 --> 04:14.880
Then how did you know
I was at the dog park?

04:14.960 --> 04:20.339
Because I was driving past the dog park
en route to driving past this house,

04:20.420 --> 04:22.470
which I do on a regular basis
because of traffic.

04:25.850 --> 04:29.180
I can see how you're both looking at me.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.140
-You, too!
-Don't yell at Augie.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.350
I'm not yelling at Augie!

04:32.430 --> 04:35.860
This is, uh, where I say, "I should go."

04:35.940 --> 04:40.530
No, no. Sol should go
before he embarrasses himself any further.

04:40.610 --> 04:44.860
I am not embarrassed about any of this.

04:44.950 --> 04:47.830
I walk into places all the time like this.

04:47.910 --> 04:50.200
And I leave like this, too.

04:53.290 --> 04:56.330
Not embarrassed!

05:03.720 --> 05:06.260
I am so sorry about that.

05:07.550 --> 05:09.220
Oh, it's OK.

05:09.300 --> 05:13.730
I mean...
you told him Augie's full name

05:13.810 --> 05:16.100
and totally neglected
to mention mine, but--

05:16.190 --> 05:18.360
He's a crazy person.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.650
I didn't want to introduce you
to a crazy person.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.690
Well, I didn't see a crazy person.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.530
What did you see?

05:26.450 --> 05:30.780
I saw a man in love... who seems tortured.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.010
This is a-a really nice room.

05:43.090 --> 05:46.130
That's right. You haven't seen it before.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.510
Full confession: I used my AARP discount.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.640
I'm too embarrassed to use mine.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.890
Oh, there's a whole section in
the magazine on how to deal with that.

05:55.890 --> 05:57.940
-May I help you?
-Oh, yeah.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.690
I think if we just free one of these up...

06:01.770 --> 06:04.480
Oh... I'm sorry.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.280
The last time I was here
I ordered champagne

06:10.370 --> 06:12.620
and ended up drinking it
all by myself.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.330
Well, you won't have to do it this time.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.950
I made the wrapping paper.

06:53.030 --> 06:55.290
I would never have not thought that.

06:55.830 --> 06:58.250
Is something going to explode in my face?

06:58.330 --> 07:00.960
Only love, laughter
and positive feelings.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.960
All the things you treasure about me.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.340
Like how I've always been there for you.

07:06.420 --> 07:10.840
Remember when your mother found your
birth control and I pretended it was mine?

07:10.930 --> 07:14.680
And I still got grounded because everyone
knew you were post-menopausal,

07:14.760 --> 07:17.140
because you kept telling us
you were post-menopausal.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.520
But the effort. That's what moved you so.

07:26.150 --> 07:30.610
I'm not sure where it starts and...
where it ends.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.240
-This is a...
-A poncho.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.370
-Poncho.
-Or a Christmas tree skirt,

07:36.450 --> 07:38.620
-if that's what you see.
-I don't see.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.580
I would've brought one for everybody
but it took me three years to knit.

07:41.670 --> 07:45.420
Plus, I thought it would be
just the two of us this morning.

07:45.500 --> 07:50.300
Yeah, I asked Stephen and Erica
to join me as protection and/or witnesses.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.680
And/or also best friends.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.470
-Best friend Stephen, the lights?
-No, the--

07:55.550 --> 07:57.060
Oh, I don't think I know
where the light switch is.

07:57.140 --> 08:00.640
Yeah, Stephen doesn't know stuff.
And let's just leave the lights on.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.600
Oh, I have a-an audio/visual
experience prepared.

08:04.690 --> 08:08.820
And I think we can maybe just
talk through your experience with words.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.690
OK.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.200
The word is yeast.

08:19.450 --> 08:21.160
I've done some research,

08:21.250 --> 08:25.750
and I've found that scientists
at the University of Bath believe yeast

08:25.830 --> 08:30.880
will duplicate palm oil's key properties
almost exactly.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.970
Women spend a lot of time
keeping yeast out of their vaginas.

08:35.049 --> 08:37.850
I don't think we can convince them
to put it back in.

08:37.929 --> 08:41.809
I thought you might say that.
So I did a little more research.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.810
What about jojoba oil? Or rapeseed?

08:44.900 --> 08:50.320
Rapeseed? Women also spend a lot of time
keeping rape out of their vaginas.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.110
Thinking you might say that,
I did a little more research,

08:54.200 --> 08:59.990
and I found the undeniable genius...
of coconut oil.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.870
Uh, we looked into coconut oil.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.000
At length. But palm oil has it beat.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.000
Mm-hmm. It doesn't require hydrogenation.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.710
-It comes with its own antioxidants.
-It inhibits cancer growth.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.300
It has amazing mouthfeel.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.920
And it doesn't affect taste or smell.
Coconut oil does.

09:14.010 --> 09:15.130
So does rapeseed.

09:15.220 --> 09:16.930
-But if I--
-Frankie,

09:17.010 --> 09:21.350
I appreciate your research
and you using your words,

09:21.430 --> 09:25.100
but at this point swapping out palm oil
would cost us a fortune

09:25.190 --> 09:26.770
and we're not gonna do it.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.360
Then I want my lube back.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.990
But we have a contract.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.160
What's in there? Is it a monkey?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.700
-What--
-Oh, you mean this?

09:40.780 --> 09:44.330
I was just about to rip this mo-fo up.

09:50.380 --> 09:55.800
I would have pre-torn it if I'd known
things would take such a dark turn.

09:57.470 --> 10:00.850
It's still a contract
even if you tear it up.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.270
Still a contract.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.770
So you're strong.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.770
Well... this hotel room
did not let us down. Mm.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.230
It certainly did not.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.110
Can we never leave?

10:16.900 --> 10:20.910
I'm pretty sure they have a system
in place that will bring us food.

10:22.490 --> 10:25.870
- Room service.
- I forgot what it's called.

10:25.950 --> 10:30.540
I... I put the menu thingy
on the door last night.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.340
I was starving.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.300
- Room service.
- Coming.

10:38.590 --> 10:42.800
Good morning.
Where can I set you up?

10:42.890 --> 10:44.600
Uh, well, wherever you like.

10:44.680 --> 10:48.020
Well, I recommend setting up
a small dining nook right about here.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.190
The breakfast train
is rolling into the station

10:50.270 --> 10:52.270
and... flaps up.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.070
Let's see what we have.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.610
Smells delicious.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.700
Ooh, we have...

10:59.650 --> 11:03.490
the oatmeal with fresh fruit on the side,

11:03.580 --> 11:05.700
and brown sugar on the side,

11:05.790 --> 11:08.580
and milk on the side,
and cream on the side.

11:08.660 --> 11:14.290
We also have a fan favorite, the
South-by-Southwest scramble with bacon.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.420
Mm. OK.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.760
Wait a second.
Have you found your nut compartment?

11:18.840 --> 11:21.090
Excuse me?

11:21.180 --> 11:26.600
The nut compartment. Right here
in your fridge is your nut compartment,

11:26.680 --> 11:30.940
where your assorted nuts are kept
at a nut-friendly 45 degrees.

11:31.020 --> 11:34.730
Uh, uh, Kyle? I'm sort of paying
for my friend's services by the hour,

11:34.810 --> 11:36.400
so can we just kind of wrap it up?

11:36.480 --> 11:39.070
OK, all right.
Um, well, please enjoy your breakfast.

11:39.150 --> 11:40.820
And your friend.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.990
All right. Well, if you need anything...

11:45.120 --> 11:48.250
don't hesitate to call,
because Kyle cares.

11:48.330 --> 11:49.660
-Good day.
-Good day.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.000
-Bye. Thanks.
-Bye-bye.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.790
Eat up, I intend to get my money's worth.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.420
Yes, ma'am.
I intend to give you your money's worth.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.230
Ooh, collage. Can I help?

12:10.310 --> 12:14.560
Do you see glue? Do you see interesting
photos cut into fascinating shapes?

12:14.650 --> 12:17.110
Am I wearing my smock that says
"Collage Barrage"?

12:17.650 --> 12:18.530
No.

12:18.610 --> 12:20.900
Then how is this collage?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.530
This is your contract for the lube.

12:22.610 --> 12:25.700
-Yes, yes. And where is the loophole?
-What loophole?

12:25.780 --> 12:28.740
The loophole you put in
in case things went south

12:28.830 --> 12:30.700
and I ever had to get my lube back.

12:30.790 --> 12:34.330
Ah, the one that you said you didn't need
because you're one-sixteenth Chippewa

12:34.420 --> 12:35.630
and your word is your bond?

12:35.710 --> 12:38.920
Yes, but you know not to listen to me
and so you put one in anyway.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.470
Right. That one. That's not in there.

12:41.550 --> 12:44.470
Bud, you know you have to protect me
from myself.

12:44.550 --> 12:48.720
-Yeah, but that's usually at a buffet.
-Oh, God. Maybe I should collage.

12:48.810 --> 12:53.060
Mom, let's just go talk to Brianna
and see if she'll take out the palm oil.

12:53.140 --> 12:57.270
I tried it. She won't budge and now
I've got to take my lube back from her.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.860
It cannot go out into the world
with palm oil in it. It just can't.

13:01.940 --> 13:05.240
I know, and I know you're upset,
but we made a deal.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.620
We have to break it.

13:06.700 --> 13:10.120
- I don't think we can.
- We have to. There has to be a way.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.950
OK. OK. We can look, but...

13:12.950 --> 13:16.500
Hey, you know who's good at finding
loopholes where there aren't any?

13:16.580 --> 13:18.170
Atticus Finch?

13:19.670 --> 13:20.670
And?

13:22.590 --> 13:24.300
I hope Brianna doesn't kill us.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.890
Oh, nonsense, she loves when I come by.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.140
And this will be our last time,
because after this,

13:29.220 --> 13:32.100
I'll get my lube back
and we'll be all done.

13:32.180 --> 13:33.600
So how we gonna do this?

13:33.680 --> 13:36.480
You introduce us, I introduce Dad,
Dad outlines our position,

13:36.560 --> 13:38.940
the three of us do something fun.
Bumper cars? Maybe.

13:39.020 --> 13:41.780
Sound good? Dad?

13:41.860 --> 13:43.320
Yes. I'm sorry.

13:43.400 --> 13:48.570
I yelled at a Golden Retriever yesterday
and I'm still a little torn up about it.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.490
Why would you yell at a Golden Retriever?

13:50.580 --> 13:52.450
-They're like living hugs.
-I know,

13:52.540 --> 13:55.160
but this one was meddling in my affairs.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.330
Shake it off! What's our plan?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.960
Well, our plan is very simple:

14:00.040 --> 14:04.340
There's language in section six,
paragraph J, clause B,

14:04.420 --> 14:08.010
on which a case can be made
that the reversion of rights--

14:08.090 --> 14:10.430
-Cut to the chase, Sol.
-There's a loophole.

14:11.300 --> 14:15.270
Keep 'em closed until we're inside.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.400
Keep 'em closed forever.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.030
-Robert.
-Hello, everyone.

14:25.110 --> 14:27.030
I take it you weren't expecting them.

14:27.110 --> 14:29.490
I was not because
they don't have an appointment.

14:29.570 --> 14:32.410
Oh, we have a standing appointment...
with justice.

14:32.490 --> 14:36.330
I guess barging in through closed doors
is a family tradition.

14:36.410 --> 14:40.580
I just came to look at the new offices,
which are beautiful. Goodbye.

14:40.670 --> 14:42.800
No, Daddy. Daddy, no, no.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.090
Why are you here?

14:45.170 --> 14:46.970
We just want to go over something
in the contract.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.930
Oh, Jesus Christ.

14:49.010 --> 14:51.970
And I'm hopped up on ginkgo biloba
and ready to rumble.

14:52.050 --> 14:57.520
OK. Well, I will need
my in-house counsel here for that. Adam!

14:58.520 --> 15:00.690
Sorry, I was just-- Yay, Frankie's back!

15:00.770 --> 15:03.570
-I mean, boo, Frankie's back.
-Get Karen in here ASAP.

15:03.650 --> 15:05.190
Uh, Karen had her baby yesterday.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.900
Karen's always having her baby yesterday.
Is Stephen still here? Or Erica?

15:08.990 --> 15:11.360
Uh, Stephen had to leave early
for his daughter's piano recital

15:11.450 --> 15:12.740
and I don't know why Erica's not here.

15:12.830 --> 15:15.450
Great. I'm glad everyone
has such rich personal lives.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.910
OK, so I'll just--

15:17.000 --> 15:19.580
I'll just grab a magazine
and wait for you in the lobby.

15:19.670 --> 15:20.960
OK. I'm waiting.

15:21.040 --> 15:26.800
OK. Well, we believe there's language
in section six, paragraph J,

15:26.880 --> 15:31.470
clause B, on which a case could be made
that the reversion of rights--

15:31.550 --> 15:34.260
-Ha!
-Excuse me?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.720
I think I'll stay.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.810
My daddy thinks he'll stay.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.190
What are we gonna do today besides eat?

15:49.280 --> 15:51.200
And, uh...

15:52.110 --> 15:53.280
You know.

15:54.030 --> 15:55.450
Oh, my God.

15:56.410 --> 15:57.910
We have the whole day together.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.910
We've never had that.
We can do anything we want.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.170
Name it.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.580
Well, we could--
we could go to Balboa Park.

16:04.670 --> 16:06.710
-Sure.
-And walk in the botanical gardens.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.960
-Sure.
-Or go to the, uh, art museum.

16:10.340 --> 16:14.010
I don't care what we do
as long as we can do it together.

16:14.090 --> 16:16.680
Mmm.

16:17.390 --> 16:19.100
Oh.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.110
Hello?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.610
What happened?

16:29.650 --> 16:31.400
Where is she now?

16:32.570 --> 16:34.280
Ah, shit.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.280
I'll be right there.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.830
What happened?

16:39.910 --> 16:42.410
Elaine ran out of the house,

16:42.500 --> 16:44.830
and the dog ran after her.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.540
They can't find either of them.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.500
That was her aide.

16:49.090 --> 16:50.460
Oh, God.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.420
I've gotta go.

16:53.130 --> 16:54.180
I'm sorry.

16:54.260 --> 16:57.220
You don't have to apologize.
Do you want me to come with you?

16:57.300 --> 16:58.600
What?

16:58.680 --> 17:00.600
Well, I just meant...

17:00.680 --> 17:02.640
I don't know what I meant.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.980
I'll call you.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.740
Oh. Phil!

17:22.119 --> 17:24.660
Phil? Phil!

17:27.460 --> 17:28.880
Oh. Damn it.

17:32.670 --> 17:34.420
I think we might be able to resolve this.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.720
You also thought it would be fun
to go on a hayride for your birthday.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.760
It was fun. I was right. I regret nothing.

17:40.850 --> 17:43.310
I'm done.

17:45.390 --> 17:46.390
And?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.480
I can see where they think
they have a case.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.280
A case for what?
Deporting natural-born citizens?

17:52.360 --> 17:55.740
There's a slim chance they could
make trouble if this ends up in court.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.870
We do have the option
of letting the courts decide.

17:59.950 --> 18:01.080
Is that a threat?

18:01.160 --> 18:05.080
-No, it's an attempt at mediation.
-Mediation?

18:05.160 --> 18:07.420
You barged in here through closed doors

18:07.500 --> 18:09.540
to threaten people
trying to go about their business.

18:09.630 --> 18:13.130
Well, we're being shut out of something
we built together

18:13.210 --> 18:16.050
so we have no choice but to barge in.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.260
Exactly. Yes. The lube. Yes.

18:18.340 --> 18:23.100
But if you barge in, you force the other
party to talk before they might be ready.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.220
That's because we've been
given no indication

18:25.310 --> 18:27.520
of when the other party
might possibly be ready.

18:28.140 --> 18:32.400
Sometimes you don't get to control
when the other party is ready.

18:32.480 --> 18:36.950
Well, sometimes the other party
is just a big, stupid man-baby!

18:46.540 --> 18:48.460
I did not come here to be insulted by you.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.920
Look, I think we can agree that they
are no longer talking about the lube.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.510
But I think we can also agree
that my side is winning.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.920
But we have a contract,
which I can't believe

18:58.010 --> 19:02.010
I have to keep on explaining to a lawyer
and the mother and ex-wife of a lawyer.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.180
That sounds like she gave birth to me
and then married me.

19:04.260 --> 19:05.770
Oh, didn't she?

19:05.850 --> 19:10.850
We may have a contract, but it's flimsy.
Flimsy like your contract.

19:10.940 --> 19:13.190
Oh, my contract is ironclad.

19:13.270 --> 19:15.690
- Flimsy.
- Ironclad.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.900
-Flimsy.
-Ironclad.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.610
-Flimsy.
-It's clad in iron.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.030
-It's flimsy.
-Ironclad. Ironclad. Ironclad.

19:21.110 --> 19:22.490
I can do this all day.

19:22.570 --> 19:26.040
I have done this all day. Flimsy!

19:27.700 --> 19:29.620
-Home.
-Home.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.060
Were you out looking, too?

19:50.060 --> 19:51.520
Oh. No.

19:52.350 --> 19:55.400
What happened exactly?
She ran out of the house?

19:55.480 --> 19:57.900
Yeah.
This happens sometimes when Phil's gone.

19:57.980 --> 19:58.990
She goes looking for him.

19:59.070 --> 20:02.070
They found her at a neighbor's house,
but she wouldn't leave

20:02.160 --> 20:03.200
until Phil came to get her.

20:03.910 --> 20:06.370
-We're still looking for their dog.
-Oh, God.

20:06.450 --> 20:09.960
I know. Poor Phil. I feel bad for him.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.750
Yeah. Oh.

20:11.830 --> 20:13.580
Uh, would you please
give this to him?

20:13.670 --> 20:15.540
I don't want to bother them,
but I--

20:17.630 --> 20:20.380
No. OK.

20:23.010 --> 20:24.430
Ah! Shoot it!

20:28.970 --> 20:31.350
OK, good dog. Here you go.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.900
Come on, dummy.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.320
Do you know her?

20:39.110 --> 20:40.440
Yes.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.660
I found your dog.
Or your dog found me.

20:44.700 --> 20:45.700
Thank you.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.990
It's OK. This is Mickey.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.410
-He lives with us.
-I can't walk him.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.040
That's OK. I'll walk him.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.580
Hmm.

20:55.670 --> 20:58.210
Can you sit with me? Do you sing?

20:58.290 --> 21:00.340
No, I'm sorry.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.710
Nobody wants to hear me sing.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.260
Oh, I like to go caroling. Pretty lights.

21:05.340 --> 21:07.550
Do you think we're gonna
have a white Christmas?

21:10.100 --> 21:12.230
I think I'd-- I'd better get going.

21:12.310 --> 21:16.690
Oh, no. Please stay.
You have such a nice smile.

21:18.020 --> 21:20.570
Thank you. But I-- I really should--

21:20.650 --> 21:24.530
-Stay.
-Don't go. Stay.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.950
Well, maybe for a little bit.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.840
I think it was FDR who said it best--

21:38.920 --> 21:43.920
Don't start misquoting
Franklin Delano Roosevelt to me!

21:44.010 --> 21:46.430
Well, excuse me.
What are you, a prognosticator?

21:46.510 --> 21:48.800
What are they saying?

21:48.890 --> 21:49.890
I lost the thread.

21:49.970 --> 21:53.180
Something about Franklin Roosevelt's
third inaugural address.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.270
-Ah.
-I should have taken that job in Hong Kong

21:55.390 --> 21:57.440
after college.
There's a 15-hour time difference.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.150
I wouldn't have to talk
to any of you people.

21:59.230 --> 22:03.650
You'd be tiny pictures in my Facebook feed
I'd rarely look at and eventually block.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.950
Can we just go back to our corners
and do the "re's":

22:08.030 --> 22:11.490
regroup, rethink and remember
that we love each other?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.370
- Well, I hate you both.
- Oh, this is so silly.

22:14.450 --> 22:19.500
Why are we even still talking about this?
Let's just let the courts decide.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.000
If you take me to court,
the only thing that will be decided

22:23.090 --> 22:25.380
-is we're no longer friends.
-Because we'll always be family?

22:25.460 --> 22:28.590
No, I'm serious. All of this nonsense
is now putting my company

22:28.680 --> 22:30.890
and my employees in jeopardy.

22:30.970 --> 22:33.930
This isn't going to be something that
we'll all solve with a healing circle.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.850
Which is exactly what
I've been trying to say

22:36.940 --> 22:40.150
and why I brought up FDR
in the first place!

22:40.230 --> 22:44.940
Stop, just stop. This is exhausting.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.200
We're going back and forth
and getting nowhere.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.370
Once we finally climb out
of this FDR hole,

22:51.450 --> 22:54.870
you're going to say again that I shouldn't
have done what I did with Frankie.

22:54.950 --> 22:57.910
And I'm going to remind you again
that it was an ending.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.620
And then you're going to
remind me again

22:59.710 --> 23:01.960
that it was the one thing
you can't get over.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.210
So I'm gonna bring up Jeff
and you're gonna say it's not analogous

23:05.300 --> 23:09.180
and somehow,
we're gonna end up back on FDR!

23:12.430 --> 23:14.430
We are going in circles, aren't we?

23:14.510 --> 23:20.440
Robert... there's only
so much time we have left.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.150
And we've already wasted so much of it.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.320
I know.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.910
You're mad. And lonely.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.330
Wouldn't you rather be mad and not lonely?

23:37.080 --> 23:38.370
Maybe.

23:38.450 --> 23:41.120
So what's holding you back?

23:42.630 --> 23:44.500
What if we're being punished?

23:46.050 --> 23:50.010
I mean, what if we'll never be able
to be happy

23:50.090 --> 23:55.010
because our entire relationship was
based on lies and betrayals so awful

23:55.100 --> 23:57.140
that karmically we're doomed?

23:58.980 --> 24:01.690
Wow. You're more Jewish than I am.

24:01.770 --> 24:05.020
Well, we Catholics
know our way around guilt, too.

24:06.020 --> 24:09.400
I'd like to think we're not being punished
for loving each other.

24:11.530 --> 24:13.740
I'd like to think so, too.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.620
So what do we do?

24:20.710 --> 24:22.210
I don't know.

24:23.210 --> 24:26.210
All I know is
I don't want to be mad anymore.

24:27.250 --> 24:28.880
Then maybe don't be.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.690
All I'm saying is
you're kind of overreacting.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.860
Get out of my way.
I don't wanna be out here anymore.

24:51.940 --> 24:54.860
-This is what you do.
-What I do?

24:54.950 --> 24:59.240
Why don't you grow up and stop doing
everything your mommy tells you to do?

24:59.330 --> 25:01.160
I'm the one trying to keep it
professional.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.540
You're the one made it personal.

25:02.620 --> 25:04.870
Aren't you supposed to be a big,
smart "businesswoman"?

25:04.960 --> 25:07.630
Oh, right.
Your mommy gave you this company.

25:07.710 --> 25:11.090
Oh, stop it.
You're being so mean to each other.

25:11.170 --> 25:14.470
I hate this.
You're friends. We're friends.

25:14.550 --> 25:16.140
Maybe none of this is worth it.

25:16.220 --> 25:20.810
The whole point of my lube
was to have less friction in the world.

25:20.890 --> 25:23.480
And all it's done is make more.

25:24.230 --> 25:26.810
You can do whatever you want with it.
It's yours.

25:28.270 --> 25:29.570
I'm sick of fighting.

25:32.150 --> 25:35.740
You're not gonna come back next week
with a family of orphaned orangutans?

25:36.450 --> 25:37.910
No.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.790
-So we're done here?
-No.

25:41.870 --> 25:43.460
So close.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.660
I want my art off the box.

25:45.750 --> 25:48.670
What? But that was, like,
the most important thing to you.

25:48.750 --> 25:54.170
I can't have my vagina
associated with palm oil.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.430
Done.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.600
So I can have my paintings back?

25:59.680 --> 26:03.350
I will put them in your car myself.
They might already be in your trunk.

26:05.810 --> 26:07.020
Now we're done.

26:09.690 --> 26:11.650
Am I the only one who needs a hug?

26:11.730 --> 26:12.780
Yes.

26:13.490 --> 26:16.900
Oh, Jesus, Bud. Read the room.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.370
What's your name again?

26:25.460 --> 26:28.040
-I'm Grace.
-Grace.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.750
I have lots of
Christmas shopping to do.

26:32.840 --> 26:36.010
And I never know
what to get my mother.

26:36.090 --> 26:37.720
And I have to cook.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.850
Honey, we should let Grace go now.

26:41.930 --> 26:45.140
- It's almost time for dinner.
- Can I eat outside?

26:45.220 --> 26:47.060
Of course you can.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.810
What's her name again?

26:51.900 --> 26:54.650
-Grace.
-Grace.

26:54.730 --> 26:57.570
That's right. That's me. I'm Grace.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.280
You're Grace.

27:07.870 --> 27:09.620
It's you.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.050
It's always been you.

27:21.930 --> 27:23.390
I remember.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.690
Um, I have to go.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.320
What's her name again?

27:40.610 --> 27:42.200
I'll be right back.

27:43.450 --> 27:44.910
Grace.

27:45.660 --> 27:46.870
Grace, wait.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.290
She saw me.

27:49.370 --> 27:52.630
She knew me.
She knows about us.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.420
-How could I have done this to her?
-I'm sorry.

28:00.630 --> 28:04.050
Sometimes she's there for a second.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.890
It just makes everything worse.

28:06.970 --> 28:09.730
So much worse.

28:09.810 --> 28:11.600
I feel sick.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.940
You didn't do anything to her.

28:14.730 --> 28:15.900
I did.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.400
Please don't.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.030
I can't.

28:21.110 --> 28:22.820
I just can't.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.350
Hi.

28:55.310 --> 28:57.020
Hi.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.320
How were your grandkids?
Did they cheer you up?

29:00.400 --> 29:01.990
-Grandkids?
-Yeah.

29:02.070 --> 29:03.280
Oh.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.530
You know kids don't cheer me up.

29:07.530 --> 29:09.700
I'll ignore that statement.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.200
And the fact that you forgot my burrito.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.580
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.880
It's OK. I think I need pizza.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.970
-You want in?
-I'm not hungry.

29:27.550 --> 29:29.350
I'm not either.

29:31.220 --> 29:34.560
Well, maybe I'm a little hungry.
