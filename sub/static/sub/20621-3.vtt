WEBVTT

00:24.859 --> 00:26.360
Hurry up! Let's go!

00:26.444 --> 00:28.779
Dad, I don't want
to go to church.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.656
Too bad. You have to go.

00:32.992 --> 00:35.494
I hate going to temple.

00:37.413 --> 00:40.916
I don't feel good. I
just want to stay home!

00:45.546 --> 00:48.632
I don't want to go to processing
to have my thetans cleared.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.187
Here you go.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.275
Whoa, this is good. What is it?

01:06.358 --> 01:07.526
It's bacon.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.070
You've never had this before?

01:09.153 --> 01:10.321
Nope.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.911
Hello?

01:16.994 --> 01:17.828
Yeah, he's right here.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.997
Dev, your mom's on the phone.

01:22.625 --> 01:23.501
Hi, Mom.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.128
I thought you were coming home.
What are you doing over there?

01:26.212 --> 01:27.671
I'm eating bacon.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.381
Dev...

01:29.465 --> 01:31.383
Bacon is pork. We are Muslims.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.719
We are not allowed to eat pork.

01:33.803 --> 01:36.472
I can't eat it?
But it's so good.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.432
Po-da. That's our religion.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.809
Hurry up and come home.

01:39.892 --> 01:40.726
Okay.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.129
Salaam alaikum, brother.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.463
Why you saying "salaam alaikum"?

02:51.547 --> 02:54.592
Salil Uncle and Sabina
Auntie are religious.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.344
Say you are fasting for Ramadan.

02:57.428 --> 02:59.180
Don't order any pork.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.182
Seriously? I got to
pretend like I'm fasting?

03:01.265 --> 03:02.641
Just play along, man.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.519
You're an actor, or
you were an actor.

03:05.603 --> 03:06.812
I don't know what you do now.

03:06.937 --> 03:07.813
All right, let's go.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.231
All right.

03:09.315 --> 03:10.232
Ah.

03:10.316 --> 03:11.233
Hey, how's it going?

03:11.317 --> 03:12.902
As-salaam alaikum, Dev.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.904
Dev, it is so good
to see you, beedu.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.322
Good to see you too.
How is everything?

03:16.405 --> 03:17.573
Wonderful.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.242
So, Dev, how was
the fasting today?

03:20.326 --> 03:21.410
Um, it was good.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.704
You know, I didn't eat anything
from sunrise to sunset,

03:23.787 --> 03:25.956
so I'd say solid fast.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.501
And it must be very difficult to fast
with all those tasty cupcakes at work.

03:29.585 --> 03:30.419
Mm.

03:30.502 --> 03:34.173
Did you know Hakeem Olajuwon
fasted during the NBA Finals?

03:34.256 --> 03:36.592
Wow. Fun fasting
fact, huh, Navid?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.385
Yeah, I've heard it before.

03:38.469 --> 03:39.303
Sorry to interrupt, folks.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.513
I wanted to let you know that
spectacular pork dish I mentioned,

03:41.597 --> 03:43.349
we're down to our last one
if you'd like to order it.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.309
No, we don't eat pork.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.393
Okay, no problem.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.437
Um, I'll be right back
to take your order.

03:48.479 --> 03:49.897
Great.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.149
Navid, you're looking good, man.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.235
Do you ever think
about modeling?

03:54.318 --> 03:55.236
Like fashion modeling?

03:55.319 --> 03:56.612
You are a handsome guy.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.656
We need more Indian models.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.407
More? Is there even one?

04:00.491 --> 04:04.745
Inshallah, Navid will
be the first one.

04:04.828 --> 04:05.913
Tell Dev

04:05.996 --> 04:07.539
to make some photos.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.333
We'll make a portfolio

04:09.416 --> 04:11.835
and do some posing like this.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.464
One... two...

04:15.547 --> 04:16.757
and three.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.259
Wow.

04:18.342 --> 04:19.593
So, Navid, we'll schedule
that shoot soon.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.011
- Sounds good.
- Good.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.846
Auntie, Uncle, what are
you guys doing in town?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.599
Your uncle got us tickets to see
the Timberwolves play the Knicks

04:25.683 --> 04:28.018
at MSG for our anniversary.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.687
Ah, it's gonna be sensational.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.896
And the timing has worked out

04:30.980 --> 04:33.607
so that we can say the Eid
prayer with your parents.

04:33.691 --> 04:34.692
Oh.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.235
And, Dev, will you
be joining us?

04:36.318 --> 04:38.612
I don't know. I'm not
sure if I'm coming.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.114
He is coming.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.949
Okay, all right, I
guess I'm coming.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.702
Navid, you have good hair.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.621
You can do some
commercial for shampoo.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.248
What would the poses
look like for that?

04:49.331 --> 04:52.334
For a sexy hair, like this.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.044
Wow. Navid, you want
to try it one time?

04:54.128 --> 04:55.629
We'll save it for the shoot.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.382
I don't know. You got an expert here.
Might as well take advantage, right'?

04:59.341 --> 05:01.218
- For sexy hair...
- Like this.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.678
You got it.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.431
- Dev, how was your trip to Italy?
- It was great.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.267
You must come with us to
hajj in Mecca next year.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.977
Your father says
you're quite pious.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.104
Uh, you know, I try.

05:12.187 --> 05:15.399
Dev says prayer five
times a day, every day.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.485
Do you like this mosque we're
going to this weekend?

05:18.569 --> 05:21.071
Um... yeah.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.656
It's a really good mosque.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.159
They have really good AC.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.411
Always a good temperature
for the prayer.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.580
And, um, the carpet's
very soft, too.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.957
It's one of my-- one of
my top five mosques...

05:32.833 --> 05:35.127
...in-- in the world.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.754
How was dinner?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.423
How's my boy Ramesh?
How's my girl Nish?

05:39.506 --> 05:40.841
They're good.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.634
Got some religious
relatives in town,

05:42.718 --> 05:45.304
so I had to put on a
little bit of a show.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.723
Is your family religious,
super into Hindu stuff?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.308
They're not super religious,

05:49.391 --> 05:51.810
but they did make me
go to temple as a kid.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.646
I'd be decked out in a Sean
John velour suit like...

05:54.730 --> 05:57.483
♪ Jaya Jagadisa Hare ♪

05:58.859 --> 06:00.694
They make you
go to mosque as a kid?

06:00.778 --> 06:03.072
Yeah, we'd go
for the big holidays.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.865
I remember when my mom
took me for the first time.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.825
I thought I was gonna see that
Jim Carrey movie The Mask,

06:06.909 --> 06:08.369
then we end up at the mosque.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.496
Not exactly the same.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.164
Ugh, they're still doing it.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.791
My mom wants me to go
to this Eid prayer.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.833
Can I bail?

06:14.917 --> 06:15.918
Dude, just go.

06:16.001 --> 06:16.960
Why?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.587
Because you got to compromise.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.881
I mean, just throw them a
bone every now and then.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.966
Remember when Q and
I got married?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.761
My parents wanted us to have
some four-hour Hindu ceremony

06:25.844 --> 06:28.055
with some rando
priest from Queens.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.557
We just said, "Fine,"
but, in return,

06:30.641 --> 06:32.893
we played 100% rap
at the reception,

06:32.976 --> 06:34.645
explicit versions.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.146
Oh, I remember, Tanvi.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.606
It was pretty intense
when you guys came out

06:37.689 --> 06:39.817
to "Fuck That Shit"
by Three 6 Mafia.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.569
Hey, man, that's our song.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.743
Navid, you're jacked, man.
How often you go to the gym?

06:49.827 --> 06:51.829
Not that much. Like
four times a week.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.330
Mostly chest and arms?

06:53.414 --> 06:54.915
Surprisingly, I do mostly back.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.708
- Why back?
- I want a wide frame.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.585
It's all about the frame.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.337
How's my frame?

07:00.421 --> 07:01.547
Dude...

07:01.630 --> 07:02.464
You're a twig.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.383
Shut up.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.468
So, uh, what's good to get here?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.429
Ooh, that Cubano's awesome.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.055
It's got pork in it, though.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.223
You eat pork?

07:11.306 --> 07:13.225
Yeah, come on, you know
I'm not religious.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.103
- Do you eat pork in front of your parents?
- No way. My mom would pinch me.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.604
What about you? Have
you ever had pork?

07:17.688 --> 07:18.897
Not really.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.899
You must be curious,
though, right?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.990
Oh, my God.

07:28.073 --> 07:28.991
This is so good.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.159
Right?

07:30.242 --> 07:31.535
Pork is amazing.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.370
It's just like
chicken but juicier.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.123
Thanks for convincing
me not to fast today.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.167
All right, so be honest.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.376
How religious are you?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.086
You really go to
prayer and stuff?

07:41.170 --> 07:42.713
I do the Friday prayer
here and there.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.923
I believe in God. I
do parts of Islam.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.175
I give to charity.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.135
I try not to be too
materialistic.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.262
But there's definitely parts
I just can't keep up with.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.430
Like what?

07:51.513 --> 07:53.390
You got to swear you
won't tell anyone.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.392
I started drinking.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.895
What? Do your parents know?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.230
No way. I could never
tell them that.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.523
Hey, I get it. We're Indian.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.025
Got to keep up that facade.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.277
Not like white kids telling
their parents about fucking.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I
said one bite, friend.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.990
Have fun with your
portobello and hummus.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.328
How can you think Towns
is better than Porzingis?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.829
Porzingis can shoot the three.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.247
Porzingis is too skinny.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.291
He can't bang in the
post like Towns.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.002
Get this guy a protein
shake, then we'll talk.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.338
You know who is
good at basketball?

08:24.421 --> 08:26.632
Michael Jordan.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.384
Yeah, Ramesh, he's good.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.262
Okay, where shall we have
dinner to celebrate Eid?

08:32.346 --> 08:34.014
How about some nice seafood?

08:34.097 --> 08:37.559
My friend Dr. Ibrahim said there's a
very nice Thai restaurant we should try.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.436
Hmm, Thai food.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.230
It's too spicy.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.524
Ramesh. I love Thai food.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.234
We can go there.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.818
What's going on, guys?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.320
Salaam alaikum, beedu.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.614
Alaikum salaam.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.783
Uh, I think I'm gonna head out,
but have fun at the game, guys.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.909
Stay for prayer.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.953
Uhh, I think I'll just
catch my prayer at home.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.538
But have a good time.
All right, bye.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.583
So I've
been going to...

09:01.667 --> 09:02.960
- Dude.
- What's up?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.294
Check this out.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.046
It's Hog Wild Weekend at
Smorgasburg tomorrow.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.089
What's Hog Wild Weekend?

09:07.172 --> 09:09.174
It's this big food festival that
has some of the best barbecue

09:09.258 --> 09:10.592
from all over the country.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.928
My friend Curtis went last year,
and he said it's amazing.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.471
Let's skip prayer
and go tomorrow.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.515
You want to skip Eid prayer and
go to a barbecue festival?

09:16.598 --> 09:17.641
That's bad, even for me.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.393
Come on. I got a lot
of catching up to do.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.852
Let me see this.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.437
Oh, shit, Tickler's
is in the mix.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.605
I went once in Nashville.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.065
It was ridic.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.817
All right, how do
we skip the prayer?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.277
Um...

09:28.360 --> 09:30.779
Let's say we got food poisoning and
that we'll do prayer from home.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.198
- How do we both get food poisoning?
- We're hanging out tonight.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.325
We can say we got halal cart,
and then we both got sick.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.910
Ooh, that's good.

09:36.994 --> 09:37.911
Come on. You in?

09:37.995 --> 09:39.496
Yeah.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.434
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

10:42.517 --> 10:43.352
Oh, yeah.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.941
How are you still eating?
You're not full?

10:50.025 --> 10:51.443
Dude, this sausage
looks so good.

10:51.526 --> 10:52.569
I just got to have a bite.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.196
Oh, shit, Denise in the cut.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.781
- What up, boo?
- What are you doing here?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.532
Man, you know I fuck with ribs.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.159
Have y'all tried that spot
from Kansas City yet?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.078
Man, them honey wings is bonk.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.080
Denise, this is my cousin Navid.
Navid, this is Denise.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.206
- What up, man?
- Not much--

11:04.289 --> 11:05.916
Oh, shit, it's your dad. Hide.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.335
Stay down.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.091
Oh.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.094
Sorry. Just some similar-looking
Indian dude eating corn on the cob.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.512
Man, I almost had
a heart attack.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.763
I thought it was him.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.057
Why the fuck were we just
hiding behind that damn tree?

11:22.140 --> 11:24.559
His dad doesn't know
that we eat pork.

11:24.643 --> 11:25.852
It's against our religion.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.646
Wait, aren't y'all
two grown-ass men?

11:27.729 --> 11:29.690
Yeah! But we're scared
of our parents.

11:29.773 --> 11:30.857
Okay, this is crazy.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.902
Now, I got some religious relatives
that's not into the whole lesbian thing,

11:33.985 --> 11:35.779
but I ain't got
to hide who I am.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.906
Not that eating pork is on the same
level of scrutiny as being gay,

11:37.989 --> 11:39.074
but you know what I'm saying.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.784
Yeah. Are you religious at all?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.370
We've been friends since we was kids.
You know I go to church sometimes.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.455
Oh, yeah.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.581
You do do that.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.669
Navid raja, are
you feeling okay?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.963
Yeah, I feel a lot better
after resting now.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.802
Um, how was the prayer?
Sorry I missed it.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.013
Your father's cell phone went off
in the middle of the second rakat.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.725
I set a reminder to
go to the prayer.

12:04.808 --> 12:07.644
I set the wrong time.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.065
All right, guys, uh,
we ready to order?

12:12.149 --> 12:13.191
Uh, yes.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.985
We'll have the mango salad,

12:15.068 --> 12:16.945
uh, crab fried rice,

12:17.028 --> 12:19.531
and a veggie green
curry-- medium spicy.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.116
Navid, do you want
something else?

12:21.199 --> 12:22.826
No, I'm not that hungry.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.454
And for you guys?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.664
Um, is there any specialties
of the kitchen?

12:27.748 --> 12:30.542
The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli
is probably our most popular dish.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.793
It's fantastic.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.336
We don't eat pork.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.549
You know what? I do.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.092
And I'll have that.
That sounds good.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.762
What-- What's going on?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.598
He's just joking.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.725
Uh, I'm actually not joking.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.979
I'm not that
religious, and, uh...

12:51.062 --> 12:52.397
I eat pork.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.523
But it's okay

12:53.607 --> 12:55.609
'cause I'm a good person.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.235
And I'm 33 years old,

12:57.319 --> 12:59.321
and I can make those decisions,
I can eat what I want,

12:59.404 --> 13:01.406
and I-I want to eat the crispy
pork with the broccoli.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.617
Ow! Pinches!

13:03.700 --> 13:05.702
If you are going to order
that, we are leaving.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.745
You're gonna leave?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.288
Yes, we are.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.664
What is arugula?

13:09.748 --> 13:11.333
Ramesh, we are
getting out of here.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.544
Goodie-goodie! Can we all
go to seafood place?

13:14.628 --> 13:16.254
I like mahi-mahi.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.842
I can't
believe you did this.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.720
Uncle and Auntie
were very offended.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.222
Well, I'm sorry
they're offended.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.015
But you know what?
I'm not religious.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.142
And I don't think it's
right to pretend to be.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.393
What do you mean you
are not religious?

13:30.477 --> 13:31.520
It's just not for me.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.979
What's not for you?

13:33.063 --> 13:34.773
Um, well, there's
definitely issues.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.233
What about all the
stuff with women?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.859
What is this, Fox News?

13:37.943 --> 13:39.110
Why am I under attack?

13:39.194 --> 13:40.028
Po-da.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.488
You know we don't believe that.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.824
Some people have bad
interpretations.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.035
Yeah, and, you know, you guys
have your interpretations, right?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.411
You eat non-halal.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.746
You used to smoke cigarettes.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.248
You don't wear the hijab.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.751
Why can't I have my interpretation
where I'm just nice and I eat pork?

13:54.835 --> 13:55.877
It's not funny.

13:55.961 --> 13:56.920
Look, I get it.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.297
For you guys, religion
has this cultural value.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.465
It's not like that for me.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.675
It's people calling me terrorist

14:01.758 --> 14:04.219
and getting pulled out of
airport security lines.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.638
That's because you lost
your passport three times.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.806
I lost it twice.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.683
- No, three times.
- Oh, yeah.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.518
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.353
I am really disappointed in you.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.938
I'm going to bed.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.608
We could have gone to
the seafood place!

14:18.692 --> 14:20.902
None of this would
have had happened.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.070
Really?

14:22.153 --> 14:23.613
That's your takeaway
after all this?

14:23.697 --> 14:25.282
That we should've gone
to the seafood place?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.575
Yep!

14:26.658 --> 14:28.577
Good night.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.422
- Hey.
- Hey!

14:40.505 --> 14:43.341
- Whassup?
- How's it going?

14:43.425 --> 14:45.343
It's going great.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.138
I did a few colonoscopies,

14:48.221 --> 14:49.931
ERCPS.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.392
I read a little Harry Potter.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.185
The new one is very good.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.021
Mm. Good to know.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.939
So what's up? What's going on?

14:58.023 --> 14:59.900
Uh, I don't know.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.903
This iPad is not working.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.238
I took it to the Apple Store

15:05.322 --> 15:06.656
to see the Genius.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.074
He couldn't even figure it out.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.868
Did you really go
to the Apple Store?

15:09.951 --> 15:12.579
No, the line is too big.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.872
All right, let's see.

15:13.955 --> 15:14.956
So what's wrong with it?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.917
It is very dark.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.335
I think it's dying.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.212
Your brightness isn't up.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.089
Wonderful! You fixed it.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.425
- I'll see you later.
- Wait, wait.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.760
Sit down.

15:26.843 --> 15:27.969
What's going on?

15:28.053 --> 15:30.347
I tried to call Ma today.
She's still not answering.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.515
She's really mad at you.

15:32.599 --> 15:36.019
She's so mad at you, she
even got mad at me.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.480
I asked her to heat up a pizza.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.608
She said, "Go and
do it yourself!"

15:41.691 --> 15:43.401
I got scared.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.279
It's been two weeks.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.615
Isn't this a bit much
for just eating pork?

15:48.698 --> 15:50.325
It's not about eating pork.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.160
It's not about the religion.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.537
It's about you ignoring us,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.415
not realizing who you are.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.000
What do you mean?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.961
You see, our parents

16:01.044 --> 16:03.129
raised us to be a good Muslim.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.090
When you went out to school,

16:05.173 --> 16:06.591
we gave you a Qur'an.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.219
I don't think you ever read it.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.054
When you act like this,

16:11.137 --> 16:13.807
we feel like we failed you.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.017
You know that's not true.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.477
Look, man,

16:17.560 --> 16:19.229
you can drink.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.605
You can eat pork.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.691
You can smoke Mary Jane.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.151
That's your business.

16:25.235 --> 16:28.363
But when you do it
in front of Mom,

16:28.446 --> 16:30.573
it hurts her feelings.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.994
I get it.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.580
All right, I have to go and
watch some Super Singer.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.207
What's Super Singer?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.626
Super Singer is the Indian
version of The Voice.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.004
Only Indian people sings,

16:44.087 --> 16:45.296
no whites.

16:55.223 --> 16:59.644
"Dev, when I went to school,
my mother gave me a Qur'an,

16:59.728 --> 17:01.855
and I want to do
the same for you.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.899
If you are confused,
scared or worried,

17:04.983 --> 17:08.611
read this, and maybe you
will find some knowledge.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.905
Love, Ma."
