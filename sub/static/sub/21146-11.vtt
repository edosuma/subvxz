WEBVTT

01:22.834 --> 01:24.586
What's your name, boy?

01:29.174 --> 01:30.341
Jesse.

01:30.884 --> 01:32.510
Jesse who?

01:36.890 --> 01:37.891
Jesse...

01:38.683 --> 01:39.768
Custer.

01:42.353 --> 01:43.730
Put him back.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.486
No, don't, please.

01:49.569 --> 01:51.070
No, no!

01:51.780 --> 01:53.490
Please, let me out.

01:54.407 --> 01:55.700
No, please!

01:56.451 --> 01:57.952
Please, no, stop, please!

02:01.539 --> 02:03.041
Please! Let me out!

02:03.416 --> 02:04.542
Let me out!

02:05.752 --> 02:09.506
Let me out! Let me out!
Please, just let me out!

03:46.978 --> 03:48.646
After everything he did...

03:49.898 --> 03:51.816
You put him in the goddamn swamp?

03:51.900 --> 03:54.319
He can't hurt anyone from in there.

03:56.321 --> 03:57.822
You lied, Jesse.

03:57.906 --> 03:58.907
I'm sorry.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.450
You still lied.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.494
- Well, you lied, too.
- When?

04:03.828 --> 04:05.747
"When?" What, you want a list?

04:05.997 --> 04:07.874
How about, as a for instance,
when you got married?

04:08.166 --> 04:09.792
You said you understood about that!

04:10.168 --> 04:13.296
I do understand,
but now I need you to understand me.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.673
Why didn't you send him to Hell?

04:16.633 --> 04:19.052
I couldn't do that to another soul.

04:28.895 --> 04:30.188
He can't get out.

04:52.085 --> 04:53.211
What is it?

05:15.775 --> 05:17.276
Hoover. Flufferman.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.028
It's "Featherstone", sir.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.906
He and his girlfriend
are driving back from the swamps now.

05:21.990 --> 05:23.658
Having her find the weapons
was a good idea.

05:23.908 --> 05:26.244
So, she saw the empty truck and she was...

05:26.327 --> 05:27.829
Very unhappy.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.288
Good. That's a start.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.415
Question, sir.

05:30.915 --> 05:34.085
All this seems like a lot of trouble.
Can't we just kill Custer?

05:36.587 --> 05:38.965
I'm not a homosexual.

05:40.425 --> 05:43.136
Oh. No, of course not, sir.

05:43.511 --> 05:47.432
You're the pinnacle of masculinity.
No one would ever question...

05:48.433 --> 05:49.475
What did you do this time?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.269
I apologize, sir.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.772
I assumed that when you
requested prostitutes, that...

05:56.274 --> 05:57.942
Should I get you a refund?

05:58.317 --> 05:59.652
You're missing the point, Hoover.

05:59.986 --> 06:01.946
The tarp, then, sir.

06:02.030 --> 06:05.867
Yes, as much as I would enjoy seeing
your insides spread out before me

06:05.950 --> 06:09.120
like a buffet breakfast in a five-star hotel,

06:09.704 --> 06:12.582
my time with those rough-handed hooligans

06:12.665 --> 06:17.045
gave me a new perspective on things.

06:17.128 --> 06:18.212
The tarp will have to wait.

06:18.296 --> 06:20.923
For what's to come, I need you both alive.

06:21.007 --> 06:22.759
- Thank you, sir.
- What's to come, sir?

06:23.426 --> 06:24.886
The Messiah is a moron.

06:26.888 --> 06:28.639
I understand
you may find this disappointing

06:28.723 --> 06:31.100
since you've devoted
your entire lives to serving him,

06:31.184 --> 06:34.979
but I've seen monkeys in heat
with more grace and dignity.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.940
But not to worry. I'm plotting a coup.

06:38.024 --> 06:41.069
My plan is to replace the moron
with Jesse Custer

06:41.152 --> 06:43.154
and bring real order and control
to the world.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.865
I'd like you both to join me.
What do you say?

06:46.991 --> 06:48.493
The Messiah is a moron?

06:48.576 --> 06:50.369
Uh... Brilliant, sir. I like it a lot.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.998
And no doubt Custer has excellent
qualifications, but may I ask,

06:54.082 --> 06:55.333
has he agreed to this plan?

06:55.416 --> 06:56.667
Not yet. But he will.

06:56.918 --> 07:00.338
He doesn't know it yet,
but I have what he wants.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.424
So, considering the alternative
is summary execution,

07:03.508 --> 07:04.967
I assume you both are with me.

07:05.134 --> 07:07.011
- Absolutely, sir.
- Good. Go.

07:11.182 --> 07:12.183
Yes?

07:13.351 --> 07:16.938
- I'm sorry about...
- The men.

07:17.814 --> 07:22.276
I'll have to live with that memory
for the rest of my life.

07:22.527 --> 07:24.612
About my new assignment, sir...

07:24.695 --> 07:28.032
- I have some trepidations.
- Go on.

07:28.116 --> 07:31.577
Well, maybe I'm being tough
on myself, but I'm just not...

07:33.162 --> 07:37.125
I'm not sure I'm the best person for this job.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.459
I'm sure you're not.

07:38.543 --> 07:41.587
But the smart one is busy
and you're all I've got left.

07:41.671 --> 07:43.089
So get to it.

07:44.173 --> 07:48.427
And Hoover, let's pray
it doesn't come down to you.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.388
Yes, sir.

08:15.121 --> 08:16.414
I've seen enough.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.541
Whoo!

08:19.458 --> 08:21.919
I did good, right? I'm the one
who's not supposed to be here?

08:22.545 --> 08:24.338
Yeah, right, yeah, of course, you can't say.

08:24.422 --> 08:26.757
Hey, listen, I get it. I get it.

08:27.717 --> 08:29.552
Bet you're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

08:30.011 --> 08:31.095
Back to holding.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.975
Yeah.

08:41.022 --> 08:43.399
Yes? When?

08:45.276 --> 08:48.571
I appreciate the information.
Keep me updated.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.615
Who was that?

08:51.115 --> 08:54.452
New Orleans. The Saint of Killers.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.455
Bring in the next one.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.208
I don't think they're letting anybody out.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.417
What?

09:01.959 --> 09:04.086
When they find out who doesn't belong...

09:05.421 --> 09:06.631
...they're not letting them out.

09:07.757 --> 09:08.883
They're gonna make it worse for him.

09:09.425 --> 09:11.302
Where'd you hear that?

09:13.221 --> 09:15.556
I mean it, dude, who told you that?

09:21.520 --> 09:22.563
Hitler.

09:24.315 --> 09:27.109
Seriously? I don't even know
why you hang out with that guy.

09:27.193 --> 09:28.861
Everyone knows you can't trust Hitler.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.488
Yeah, but...

09:30.738 --> 09:32.782
...you know, he used to be a custodian here.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.284
He knows what they do.

09:36.327 --> 09:40.331
That's right. He did used to have
the run of this place.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.597
You know what? Since I'm pretty sure
it's my last night here,

09:56.681 --> 09:59.433
cut Caveman down. Let's have some fun.

10:19.287 --> 10:20.329
Well, I'm not worried.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.499
I mean, if he was gonna come,
he would've come by now.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.793
Yeah, well, maybe we should
just double-bolt the door.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.878
You know, just to be extra safe.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.132
You're safe. If he comes at all,
he'll be coming for me.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.301
And I'll handle it. Like I did last time.

10:33.384 --> 10:35.636
No offense, Padre, but I hope you "handle it"

10:35.720 --> 10:37.638
a little better than you did last time.

10:37.722 --> 10:40.266
Yeah, 'cause that didn't work out real great.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.643
All right. I will handle it better.

10:46.022 --> 10:47.440
What is that?

10:47.523 --> 10:50.318
Denis has been after me for a puppy, so...

10:50.985 --> 10:52.611
You got him a dog?

10:52.903 --> 10:54.155
Yeah. I couldn't resist.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.614
Oh.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.366
Well, that's nice.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.249
I shouldn't have...

11:06.459 --> 11:09.170
- I should've told you.
- Yeah, you should've told us!

11:09.253 --> 11:11.505
You know, it's just this whole...

11:12.256 --> 11:14.884
This whole situation has been tougher
than I thought.

11:15.676 --> 11:16.927
For all of us.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.096
It's been...

11:21.140 --> 11:23.017
I know we could all use a break.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.312
From waiting around for a cowboy
to come kill us?

11:26.395 --> 11:27.480
Hmm.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.232
- We could go someplace.
- Where?

11:30.316 --> 11:34.487
I hear Vancouver's great, you know.
It's got good meth and nice hiking.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.865
Vancouver. Mexico.
I don't care, anywhere but here.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.619
Yeah, and I saw this place on
YouTube in the Caribbean. Bimini?

11:42.036 --> 11:45.122
It's got gambling, catamarans.
Topless beaches.

11:45.206 --> 11:47.291
Topless... I can't be
going on no topless beach.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.920
Sunscreen has come a long way
since you were a kid, Cassidy.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.254
It's a good idea.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.423
True. Catamarans on the beach it is.

11:54.632 --> 11:56.425
We're gonna go and it's gonna be great.

11:56.509 --> 11:57.927
- Bimini, bitches!
- But...

11:58.010 --> 11:59.637
It is gonna be great! And I'ma go pack.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.888
- I'm gonna run it by Denis.
- No.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.230
Hey, remember this from Miami?

12:09.313 --> 12:11.399
Chinchilla job for the Cubans?

12:11.482 --> 12:13.484
Oh, man! That was crazy fun.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.570
You know what?
I will never, and I mean never,

12:16.654 --> 12:18.239
look at a crossbow the same way again.

12:18.656 --> 12:20.533
- Tulip.
- Yep?

12:21.117 --> 12:22.451
We can't go yet.

12:22.535 --> 12:24.578
Guys! Denis is in.

12:24.662 --> 12:26.372
- God damn it, Jesse!
- What happened?

12:27.331 --> 12:28.999
- He doesn't want to go.
- What?

12:29.083 --> 12:31.836
- That's not what I said.
- But Bimini was your idea!

12:31.919 --> 12:34.797
No, we're gonna go. I wanna go. It's just...

12:34.880 --> 12:36.590
We have to find God first.

12:36.674 --> 12:39.218
He's not here, Jesse, we looked!

12:39.301 --> 12:40.886
It's true. We've looked everywhere.

12:40.970 --> 12:41.971
Oh, you know where we didn't look,
Cassidy?

12:42.054 --> 12:43.097
I do indeed.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.181
- Bimini.
- Guys.

12:44.265 --> 12:46.600
Well, if I was God,
that's where I'd be, man. Honestly.

12:46.684 --> 12:49.061
Right. I mean, if he could be there,
why would he be here?

12:49.145 --> 12:51.272
Unless he's a complete moron,
absolutely no reason at all.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.065
- Guys.
- You know what he's doing right now?

12:53.149 --> 12:55.276
I think he's lying on the beach,
drinking a catamaran.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.653
Guys! I met Jesus.

13:01.031 --> 13:04.118
Do you mean "Jesus" Jesus,
or just some random Latino man?

13:04.201 --> 13:07.037
- The Jesus Christ.
- The guy from the cross?

13:07.121 --> 13:09.123
Beard, sandals, like 1,000 years old?

13:09.206 --> 13:11.959
Well, he was Jesus Christ's
25th great-grandson.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.211
But this Jesus, he's not right in the head.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.215
- He's an imbecile.
- They're all imbeciles, Jesse.

13:18.591 --> 13:21.010
Jesus, Buddha, the President.

13:21.093 --> 13:24.472
And God's probably
the biggest imbecile of 'em all!

13:24.555 --> 13:28.184
So I don't understand why you care
so much about finding him.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.727
Why do I care?

13:29.810 --> 13:32.354
Because he created the universe!
That's why.

13:32.438 --> 13:35.232
And maybe if you would stop being
so selfish, you would care, too!

13:36.358 --> 13:37.735
I'm selfish?

13:38.402 --> 13:39.820
Seriously?

13:41.614 --> 13:43.657
We do everything for you.

13:44.366 --> 13:48.496
You wanna go on a road trip?
Find God? We hit the road.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.499
You wanna go to New Orleans? Fine.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.460
You want to leave us with a maniac cowboy,

13:54.543 --> 13:56.712
we do it. For you!

13:57.963 --> 13:59.840
And Cassidy lost his fingers!

14:00.174 --> 14:04.094
And I practically lost my mind!
What did you lose, Jesse, huh?

14:04.595 --> 14:06.889
What the hell did you lose?

14:07.640 --> 14:10.392
Life is not just about
bikinis and beaches, Tulip.

14:10.476 --> 14:13.020
The beach was your idea!

14:13.103 --> 14:15.898
We never even heard of Bimini
until you brought it up.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.734
- Why did you get him that dog?
- The hell is that supposed to mean?

14:18.817 --> 14:19.818
You know exactly what it means!

14:19.902 --> 14:21.779
Oh, leave him alone!
He didn't do anything.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.030
No, I don't, Padre.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.616
You're gonna have to enlighten me,
'cause I think I'm a bit daft.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.867
What, you have a problem with dogs?

14:26.951 --> 14:28.953
- It's not about the dog, trust me.
- Well, what's it about, then?

14:29.036 --> 14:30.788
Is it about my son? Huh?

14:31.163 --> 14:32.373
The one you wouldn't help?

14:34.875 --> 14:36.460
With your precious Genesis.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.297
Because that's not
what it's for!

14:44.301 --> 14:47.304
Then you can tell me, where is God?

14:47.388 --> 14:49.306
<i>- Where's God?
- Humperdoo.</i>

14:49.390 --> 14:51.183
<i>- Where's God? Where's God?
- Humperdoo.</i>

14:51.267 --> 14:52.601
<i>Good question.</i>

14:52.685 --> 14:55.229
<i>I said, where's God?</i>

15:01.360 --> 15:02.695
Maybe it is about the dog.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.029
Is that who we're talking about?

15:04.113 --> 15:05.739
- Shit.
- What?

15:06.240 --> 15:07.491
Gotta go.

15:08.659 --> 15:10.286
Right under my nose.

15:11.161 --> 15:14.290
This whole time. Crazy.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.172
But this is it.

15:23.424 --> 15:24.842
This is what we've been chasing.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.221
I know where God is.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.349
- We gotta go.
- No, Jesse.

15:33.392 --> 15:34.727
You gotta go.

15:40.524 --> 15:41.525
You're not gonna come?

15:44.653 --> 15:46.530
You're just gonna stay here?

15:49.450 --> 15:50.492
What about the Saint?

15:51.368 --> 15:52.995
Like you said, Padre,

15:54.496 --> 15:56.040
he's only after you.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.110
Tyler, please.

17:06.235 --> 17:09.446
Come on, Hitler, what's the big deal?
We wanna see your Hell.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.993
We don't have much time. Open the door.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.705
But how? It's locked.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.873
- So there's no way to get in?
<i>- Nein</i>. No.

17:21.792 --> 17:23.252
Open it!

17:24.712 --> 17:26.922
Some privacy, please.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.760
Told you we can't trust him.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.889
How's this gonna work if the cell block
is down?

17:36.056 --> 17:37.474
Well, there's not enough power
for the whole block,

17:37.558 --> 17:39.768
but one cell won't be a problem.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.105
You ready, Hitler,
or did you get lost in there?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.446
Yeah, no, thank you. You do the honors.

17:51.613 --> 17:55.659
Eugene, please... Don't make me do this.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.536
I have to see this.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.668
All right. Let's party!

18:24.730 --> 18:26.899
Dude, all these people
are about to get wasted.

18:27.483 --> 18:29.818
Hey, krauts, what are you doing?
Get out of here!

18:29.902 --> 18:32.362
Hitler's gonna gas your asses.

18:33.489 --> 18:37.409
Two of your best plum cakes, please.
Extra flaky crust. <i>Danke.</i>

18:42.206 --> 18:43.290
Ah.

18:43.373 --> 18:46.376
Elsa, there you are.
I just ordered plum cakes.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.461
Oh, yum!

18:47.753 --> 18:50.172
I dropped by your house yesterday.

18:50.255 --> 18:54.051
Oh, did you?
I had to help my mother at the store.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.344
Ah.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.391
Excuse me.

19:09.817 --> 19:11.985
Yes, of course. My fault.

19:17.699 --> 19:20.327
I'm sorry. You were saying,
you were helping your mother?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.120
Adolf. See that man?

19:22.412 --> 19:27.084
With the hat? That's Herman Hoehne,
the gallery owner I told you about.

19:27.543 --> 19:30.754
We are old friends.
You must show him your drawings.

19:30.838 --> 19:32.089
Oh!

19:32.381 --> 19:33.507
They are not ready.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.509
That is what you always say.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.220
You have such talent. You must...

19:39.888 --> 19:41.098
What?

19:43.392 --> 19:47.563
Communists. They are all vermin.
They should be exiled.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.439
Yes, I suppose so.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.360
- Would you like tea?
- I'm fine, thank you.

19:56.613 --> 20:00.075
Go. Show him your work. Don't be shy.

20:00.158 --> 20:03.328
No point in having talent
if you don't act on it.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.663
Go. Now.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.131
I beg your pardon, <i>Herr</i> Hoehne.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.718
I am a great admirer of your gallery.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.052
So, as I was saying...

20:19.136 --> 20:21.805
I was wondering if you would be so kind

20:21.889 --> 20:24.474
as to have a look at my paintings?

20:25.893 --> 20:27.644
Of course, <i>mein Herr.</i>

20:30.314 --> 20:31.481
Ah...

20:33.609 --> 20:35.444
The watercolors are very capable.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.739
The lines are strong.

20:39.698 --> 20:40.741
Nice shading.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.118
I like to be encouraging.

20:47.289 --> 20:51.335
Your work shows capacity,
but lacks conviction.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.004
Vision. Daring.

20:54.546 --> 20:57.841
It's bloodless.

20:59.051 --> 21:01.887
Well, perhaps you would
prefer the charcoals more.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.182
I doubt it.

21:08.185 --> 21:11.647
I will work harder. May I show you
some more pieces in a few months?

21:18.028 --> 21:19.071
Thank you.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.365
I'm so sorry.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.120
How did it go?

21:27.996 --> 21:29.164
I don't have it.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.379
He's wrong, Adolf. What does he know?

21:35.462 --> 21:39.341
You can't let yourself be discouraged
by one homosexual's opinion.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.926
No, no, of course you're right.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.762
You have to fight for
what you want in this world.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.267
Our plum cake should be here soon.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.770
Citizens of Germany!

21:51.853 --> 21:55.399
Prepare to rise up
against the corrupt Weimar Republic!

21:55.941 --> 21:58.068
I'm sorry, no weapons allowed.

21:58.735 --> 22:01.697
Play <i>Die Internationale</i>
for the German worker!

22:01.780 --> 22:03.865
- Communist sons of whores.
- Are you deaf?

22:03.949 --> 22:07.786
- Germany will never...
- Elsa. Elsa. They have guns.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.037
Play!

22:09.121 --> 22:10.163
- What are you doing?
- You like the workers?

22:12.457 --> 22:14.084
<i>Nein,</i> bourgeoisie!

22:52.748 --> 22:53.999
<i>Ja?</i>

22:55.417 --> 22:56.752
Uh...

22:57.002 --> 23:00.964
I believe you dropped this.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.223
You! Learn the workers' anthem,

23:10.307 --> 23:13.727
or next time it will be
worse for you. I mean it!

23:14.978 --> 23:17.564
Rise up against the Republic!

23:17.647 --> 23:19.858
German workers unite!

23:24.946 --> 23:26.656
Well, they're gone now.

23:32.913 --> 23:34.956
But I think you are right.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.542
I don't want to be in Hoehne's gallery.

23:37.918 --> 23:40.629
There are many other galleries.
I shall approach them all.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.464
I wasn't with my mother yesterday.

23:43.673 --> 23:46.802
I was at the lake with Shulman.

23:47.844 --> 23:54.559
He made us a picnic, and we sat
by the lake in the sunshine all day.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.104
The bicycle repairman?

23:57.187 --> 23:59.606
He's ambitious. He knows what he wants.

24:00.482 --> 24:04.736
I'm going to him now.
Do you understand why, Adolf?

24:07.781 --> 24:09.032
Good day to you.

24:17.249 --> 24:19.251
Ah, <i>danke.</i>

24:21.419 --> 24:25.257
I'm sorry, <i>mein</i> Hitler,
but we are all out of plum cake.

24:25.674 --> 24:28.468
But I was here first.

24:28.718 --> 24:32.013
Apologies. Can I offer you some strudel?

24:34.182 --> 24:35.767
I don't like strudel.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.067
Mmm.

24:48.405 --> 24:49.406
Mmm!

24:54.244 --> 24:55.328
Wow.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.622
So, because you looked like a bitch

24:57.706 --> 24:59.624
in front of that art guy and your girlfriend,

24:59.708 --> 25:01.126
you blew up Europe?

25:01.209 --> 25:02.210
<i>Nein.</i>

25:03.753 --> 25:04.838
No.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.089
Dude.

25:06.673 --> 25:09.885
You are sick!
Hey, payback's a bitch, am I right?

25:11.261 --> 25:15.891
Next time, get the man his plum cake
or watch your back.

25:16.766 --> 25:17.893
We should get out of here.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.269
Yeah.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.659
Get him down.

25:36.036 --> 25:37.621
You! Down!

25:39.080 --> 25:40.624
Leave that camera alone.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.091
Hitler?

25:52.135 --> 25:53.553
Did you really start World War II...

25:53.637 --> 25:55.680
...because they were out of plum cake?

25:57.974 --> 26:00.310
You wouldn't understand.

26:02.354 --> 26:03.355
Tell me.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.857
Go away, Eugene.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.362
Why was that your worst memory?

26:13.907 --> 26:15.450
That was the day...

26:17.535 --> 26:21.331
The last day that I was good.

26:24.084 --> 26:26.503
That was the moment I lost myself.

26:37.389 --> 26:39.057
Will you still help me escape?

26:46.356 --> 26:47.774
Do you trust me?

26:50.694 --> 26:51.987
How do we get out?

26:52.654 --> 26:54.823
There is a back door.

26:55.907 --> 26:57.701
A secret door.

26:58.535 --> 27:00.036
Root, Eugene.

27:00.996 --> 27:01.997
Let's go, Root.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.456
Time for your screening.

27:03.540 --> 27:04.833
Don't worry, I will come for you.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.230
May I have your attention?

27:29.941 --> 27:32.235
Your attention, please?

27:34.404 --> 27:36.448
Everyone, please be quiet!

27:37.615 --> 27:40.285
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need you to do something for me,

27:40.368 --> 27:42.912
so please listen very carefully.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.874
Why should we do anything you say,
plum cake?

27:54.758 --> 28:00.096
Because I'm Adolf fucking Hitler!

28:12.442 --> 28:13.985
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.739
- Still no sign of him?
- Neither of 'em.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.369
What do you think we should do?

28:23.536 --> 28:24.662
Who knows?

28:25.997 --> 28:29.793
No, you're right.
We should just sit tight, be patient.

28:30.668 --> 28:34.464
No, you know what? Screw that.
I know what I'm gonna do.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.635
Denis. You need to make sure
he always has fresh water.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.220
All right, man?

28:41.137 --> 28:43.098
So what did you get up to last night
after I left?

28:43.181 --> 28:44.599
You got back pretty late.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.812
Do you know what? Never mind.

28:50.313 --> 28:51.815
Whoa! Where'd you get those?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.442
Jesse kept 'em. I'ma destroy 'em.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.069
Sounds like fun.
Do you want some company?

28:56.403 --> 28:58.154
Nah, nah. You two hang out.

28:58.947 --> 29:01.324
You sure it's a good idea
being alone right now?

29:01.574 --> 29:03.493
I won't be. Jenny's coming with me.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.333
- Wow!
<i>- Wow!</i>

29:10.500 --> 29:11.960
What?

29:14.671 --> 29:15.880
<i>You like her.</i>

29:16.005 --> 29:17.674
Well, of course I like her. She's me friend.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.513
<i>So take her.</i>

29:23.888 --> 29:24.889
What?

29:27.058 --> 29:28.101
<i>Take her.</i>

29:30.061 --> 29:31.062
<i>It's what we do.</i>

29:36.025 --> 29:38.236
Give me the dog.

29:40.530 --> 29:41.489
<i>Non.</i>

29:41.573 --> 29:42.657
<i>No.</i>

29:43.074 --> 29:46.494
Give me the goddamn dog!

29:51.207 --> 29:53.126
Did you know God was Man-dog?

29:53.460 --> 29:54.544
No.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.004
Did you know?

29:56.963 --> 29:57.964
No.

30:02.218 --> 30:03.887
It was a test, wasn't it?

30:04.762 --> 30:05.847
He knew I was coming.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.058
I looked God right in the eyes

30:09.142 --> 30:10.935
and I told Him He was not what I wanted.

30:13.104 --> 30:14.606
It was a test.

30:15.315 --> 30:16.900
It was a test, and I've failed.

30:17.567 --> 30:21.905
That's absolutely, 100% a possibility.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.324
What does that mean?

30:25.158 --> 30:27.869
Can you imagine the stress that comes

30:28.119 --> 30:29.829
with being master of all creation?

30:30.205 --> 30:31.706
I'm told He wasn't always like this.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.542
But there have been rumors in recent years

30:34.626 --> 30:37.086
- that God had become...
- A pervert?

30:38.463 --> 30:40.757
- Disenchanted.
- So what?

30:41.758 --> 30:45.637
God snaps, has a breakdown
and now He's not gonna come back?

30:45.720 --> 30:46.930
Honestly, I don't know.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.807
But in His apparent state,

30:50.099 --> 30:53.269
having Him back,
is that really what you want?

30:53.895 --> 30:55.021
He's God.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.482
Of course I want Him back.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.943
No. I don't think so.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.780
I've learned a lot about you
over the past few days, Jesse.

31:03.905 --> 31:04.906
I have.

31:04.989 --> 31:07.033
And I think what you truly want

31:08.201 --> 31:09.244
is forgiveness.

31:10.453 --> 31:13.456
And what exactly do I need forgiveness for?

31:14.207 --> 31:16.709
For killing your father, of course.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.215
Who told you that?

31:22.507 --> 31:26.636
Seventy-eight billion people,
give or take, since time began.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.722
With more arriving every day.

31:30.473 --> 31:35.395
Each of them with their own distinct
hopes and fears.

31:35.812 --> 31:38.898
The numbers really pile up,
you can imagine.

31:38.982 --> 31:42.151
Of course God wants to hear them all,

31:42.235 --> 31:45.071
but at a certain point,

31:45.154 --> 31:49.576
Heaven thought it best
to create a back-up system,

31:49.659 --> 31:54.247
make sure nothing important
fell through the cracks.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.417
Took a while to procure these,

31:57.500 --> 32:00.503
but I called in a few favors.

32:01.462 --> 32:02.964
Let's have a listen, shall we?

32:03.506 --> 32:04.841
Listen to what?

32:06.009 --> 32:07.093
What are they?

32:08.469 --> 32:10.346
They are your prayers.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.439
<i>Cut the fat off the back
of a baboon</i>

32:21.065 --> 32:23.234
<i>Boil it down to a pound, get a spoon</i>

32:25.194 --> 32:27.864
<i>Take the fleas from the knees of a demon</i>

32:29.198 --> 32:32.035
<i>Tell your pals and gals and come screamin'</i>

32:34.287 --> 32:36.998
<i>To the feast with the beast of the Mau Maus</i>

32:38.374 --> 32:41.210
<i>They make wine from
the spine of their bulldog</i>

32:42.420 --> 32:44.881
<i>It's a test for the best for who stays</i>

32:47.925 --> 32:51.095
I know some collectors who'd pay
some big bucks for these here.

32:51.179 --> 32:52.472
Not for sale.

32:53.056 --> 32:54.390
I want 'em gone.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.227
It won't open.

32:59.562 --> 33:02.065
Can't you just throw 'em in as they are?

33:02.148 --> 33:04.025
What, and have
one of these bullets explode?

33:04.108 --> 33:05.276
Fine.

33:07.904 --> 33:09.572
Okay to shoot those barrels back there?

33:10.073 --> 33:11.491
Be my guest.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.334
Damn it!

33:23.586 --> 33:25.922
Sorry, ladies. I ain't smelting 'em loaded.

33:29.884 --> 33:31.344
What if I give you oral sex?

33:32.637 --> 33:33.805
Whoa, whoa!

33:33.888 --> 33:35.556
Hey. No, no, it's cool.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.017
I mean, you know,
I'll think of something else.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.603
Mail 'em to Rio or someplace.

33:40.687 --> 33:42.730
No. This is important to you.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.232
I want to help.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.944
What if I come over there,

33:49.529 --> 33:50.780
tear off that apron,

33:51.406 --> 33:54.200
get down on my knees
and put your penis in my mouth?

33:54.617 --> 33:56.035
Whoa!

33:56.119 --> 34:00.832
Or what if I say you forced me
to put your penis in my mouth?

34:01.499 --> 34:03.501
Yeah, I came into your establishment

34:03.584 --> 34:06.546
looking for some simple metal smelting.

34:07.171 --> 34:08.798
And the next thing you know,

34:09.590 --> 34:11.634
- you had me on my knees.
- Hey!

34:11.718 --> 34:13.344
Okay, or what if I call my cousin

34:13.428 --> 34:15.054
who's a detective with the state police

34:15.138 --> 34:18.641
and I tell him your business here
is an illegal operation?

34:19.809 --> 34:21.310
Put the weapons in the machine.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.661
I just can't believe he lied to you.

34:39.370 --> 34:42.707
Well, what am I saying?
Of course he lied. He's a man.

34:42.790 --> 34:44.083
Men are lying pigs.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.002
Yeah.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.005
But I kind of get it.

34:50.590 --> 34:51.632
You do?

34:53.384 --> 34:54.927
Jesse's got his reasons.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.473
You know, his daddy was a preacher.

35:00.349 --> 35:01.893
Yeah, that'd mess anyone up.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.145
Hmm.

35:04.228 --> 35:06.314
- Yeah.
- And who am I to talk?

35:06.397 --> 35:07.899
I don't even know the guy.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.195
I'll settle for anyone
who doesn't punch me in the face.

35:14.405 --> 35:16.699
No, Jesse would never do that.

35:17.450 --> 35:21.370
Not even the time I cracked his skull
with a golf club.

35:24.916 --> 35:26.167
Where do you think he is now?

35:27.668 --> 35:29.796
Said he knew where God was.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.717
I probably should've gone with him.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.512
I mean the cowboy.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.058
I don't know.

35:45.019 --> 35:46.729
Jesse can handle him.

35:48.397 --> 35:49.899
Hope you're right.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.153
Come here, I need you to see something!

35:58.282 --> 35:59.867
Put out your hand.

35:59.951 --> 36:00.993
What?

36:01.077 --> 36:03.871
Yeah. It's all right. Do it.

36:06.958 --> 36:08.793
It's over 4,000 degrees in there.

36:09.919 --> 36:11.629
It could melt the armor off a tank.

36:13.548 --> 36:15.675
That thing is not even hot.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.009
Take a look at that.

37:02.221 --> 37:09.186
<i>Michael row the boat ashore
Hallelujah</i>

37:11.731 --> 37:13.107
Don't move.

37:14.150 --> 37:17.653
<i>Hallelujah</i>

37:18.613 --> 37:19.864
<i>Then you'll hear the trumpet sound</i>

37:19.947 --> 37:20.948
What's going on here?

37:21.866 --> 37:24.243
<i>Hallelujah</i>

37:25.494 --> 37:26.913
Time to go.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.582
<i>Quiet. Quiet!</i>

37:32.168 --> 37:34.629
<i>One. Two. Three. Four.</i>

37:35.922 --> 37:39.926
<i>Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine...</i>

37:40.009 --> 37:41.761
Put this back there.

37:44.347 --> 37:45.890
Come on. Let's go!

37:45.973 --> 37:46.974
Wait...

37:49.936 --> 37:50.978
The Hole?

37:51.228 --> 37:53.606
<i>Ja!</i> Yes, the back door is down there.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.024
<i>Where's Hitler?</i>

37:55.608 --> 37:56.943
<i>Look for him!</i>

37:59.362 --> 38:00.363
I can't.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.239
Yes, you can.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.867
I will be with you every step of the way.

38:41.696 --> 38:44.657
<i>God, forgive me
for not eating my broccoli.</i>

38:44.740 --> 38:46.659
<i>Forgive me for sassing my daddy.</i>

38:46.742 --> 38:49.245
<i>Forgive me for falling asleep at church.</i>

38:49.328 --> 38:51.956
<i>God, forgive me for hitting Donnie
on the playground,</i>

38:52.039 --> 38:53.916
<i>even though he deserved it.</i>

38:54.000 --> 38:56.669
<i>God, forgive me for thinking You ain't real.</i>

38:56.752 --> 38:58.629
<i>Forgive me for using Your name in vain.</i>

38:58.713 --> 39:01.549
<i>Forgive me for thinking
dirty thoughts about Miss Haggerty.</i>

39:01.632 --> 39:03.300
<i>Forgive me for falling asleep at church.</i>

39:03.384 --> 39:04.719
<i>Forgive me for giving up.</i>

39:06.429 --> 39:10.266
<i>Forgive me for being scared.
Forgive me for letting my daddy down.</i>

39:10.850 --> 39:14.520
<i>God, forgive me for losing my temper.</i>

39:14.603 --> 39:17.648
<i>Forgive me for not doing my chores
as best I could.</i>

39:17.732 --> 39:21.527
<i>Forgive me for hurting Bobby Boyd,
although he had it coming.</i>

39:21.610 --> 39:23.863
<i>Forgive me for not praying to you more.</i>

39:23.946 --> 39:28.492
<i>God, forgive me for thinking You ain't real.</i>

39:28.576 --> 39:30.161
<i>Forgive me for touching myself.</i>

39:30.244 --> 39:34.623
<i>Forgive me for asking you to
kill my father and send him to Hell.</i>

39:34.707 --> 39:36.709
<i>God, forgive me for having hate in my heart.</i>

39:36.792 --> 39:39.003
<i>God, forgive me
for shooting that Komodo dragon.</i>

39:39.086 --> 39:40.504
<i>Forgive me for talking down to Tulip.</i>

39:40.588 --> 39:43.966
<i>God, forgive me for robbing that
convenience store. That gas station.</i>

39:44.050 --> 39:46.302
<i>And that pawnbroker.
God, for robbing that zoo.</i>

39:46.385 --> 39:47.386
<i>God.</i>

39:47.470 --> 39:49.597
<i>God, forgive me for
killing that security guard.</i>

39:49.680 --> 39:52.558
<i>God, forgive me for losing my temper.
For taking that guy's eye out.</i>

39:52.641 --> 39:55.895
<i>Getting drunk. For stealing cars.
Fighting. Lying. Drinking.</i>

39:55.978 --> 39:59.231
<i>Drinking too much. Beating. Robbing.
Cheating. Lying. Drinking.</i>

39:59.315 --> 40:02.818
<i>Hurting. Punching. Stealing.
God, forgive me for killing.</i>

40:04.487 --> 40:07.740
I imagine you could
take 100,000 little old ladies,

40:07.823 --> 40:11.077
walk them back and forth
across the street for 100 years,

40:11.160 --> 40:14.580
and it still wouldn't get you
off the hook for all that.

40:14.663 --> 40:18.793
If you want to save your soul,
you need to do something big.

40:20.002 --> 40:21.879
You need to join me, Jesse.

40:23.506 --> 40:25.424
People have done worse.

40:26.050 --> 40:27.885
I bet you've done worse.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.686
Perhaps one more?

40:52.701 --> 40:55.996
I ask you again. What's your name?

40:57.248 --> 40:58.624
Jesse.

40:58.707 --> 41:00.543
Jesse who?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.049
Jesse...

41:09.135 --> 41:10.344
L'Angelle.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.888
That's a good boy.

41:15.432 --> 41:17.101
And?

41:21.313 --> 41:22.731
Thank you, God.

41:23.691 --> 41:25.568
"Thank you, God, for..."

41:29.655 --> 41:36.370
Thank you, God, for killing my father
and bringing me home.

41:39.498 --> 41:40.916
Okay. Turn it off.

41:51.802 --> 41:54.138
Your grandma loves you.

42:03.772 --> 42:08.569
<i>Thank you, God, for killing
my father and bringing me home.</i>

42:17.203 --> 42:18.329
So...

42:21.707 --> 42:24.043
You went to an awful
lot of trouble for all this.

42:24.126 --> 42:26.128
To show you that
you're the right man for the job

42:26.212 --> 42:27.755
and the job is right for you.

42:36.347 --> 42:38.515
So these are all my prayers?

42:38.807 --> 42:39.850
Yes.

42:40.309 --> 42:45.898
Over all this time... Every single one.

42:46.357 --> 42:49.151
I can make copies if you'd like to take them.

42:49.818 --> 42:51.445
No, that's all right.

42:54.114 --> 42:56.033
Why don't you just...

42:57.868 --> 42:59.662
Shove 'em up your ass.

43:05.542 --> 43:06.752
Sweet...

43:07.002 --> 43:09.338
We're done. Let me out.

43:09.713 --> 43:12.383
Is everything all right with <i>Herr</i> Starr?

43:13.342 --> 43:14.885
Let me out.

43:16.345 --> 43:18.472
I'm just going to check with him.

43:20.099 --> 43:21.100
Let me out.

43:24.144 --> 43:25.813
Let me out.

43:51.755 --> 43:57.553
Yes, Hoover, I'm sure.
Custer has left us no choice.

43:58.220 --> 44:04.226
God help us, it's all come down to you.

44:06.186 --> 44:10.566
Nothing less than the eternal dignity

44:10.649 --> 44:14.611
of the Grail is at stake.

44:20.826 --> 44:24.997
<i>Okay, good. I'm glad
we could reach this understanding.</i>

44:25.080 --> 44:27.499
<i>Now just do what you do.</i>
