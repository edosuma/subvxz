00:14.174 --> 00:15.207
That is the last time

00:15.269 --> 00:17.570
I let you talk me
into a burrito grande.

00:17.604 --> 00:19.939
I keep forgetting you got
such a delicate stomach.

00:19.973 --> 00:23.009
Well, you're the one who has to
live with the consequences.

00:23.043 --> 00:25.144
Ew. Gross.

00:25.178 --> 00:27.813
Great.

00:34.521 --> 00:36.556
Radio, code three.
We're in Elysian Park.

00:36.590 --> 00:39.792
And we have found the male
in distress on Stadium Way.

00:39.826 --> 00:41.494
Copy that.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.468
Sir?

00:49.503 --> 00:53.205
How you doin'
tonight, sir?

00:57.077 --> 00:58.678
Sir?
I don't know where I am.

00:58.712 --> 01:01.480
Okay. What's your name?
Where am I?

01:01.515 --> 01:02.882
Can you tell me
how old you are?

01:02.916 --> 01:04.150
47.

01:04.184 --> 01:06.285
Alert and oriented
times one,

01:06.320 --> 01:08.788
good radial pulse,
profusing normally.

01:08.822 --> 01:10.156
Am I gonna be okay?

01:10.190 --> 01:12.358
You're gonna be fine, sir.
Just relax.

01:12.392 --> 01:13.793
You want to G.S. him?

01:13.827 --> 01:16.495
I feel dizzy.
On three.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.197
One...

01:18.231 --> 01:20.166
Two, three.

01:44.758 --> 01:46.392
Respiration -- 12,

01:46.426 --> 01:49.495
decreased tidal volume --
100% on 02 sat.

01:49.529 --> 01:51.731
Am I having a stroke?
I don't think so,

01:51.765 --> 01:54.367
but the doctors will know exactly what's
going on after they examine you.

02:01.842 --> 02:03.843
What's that noise?
Where are we?!

02:03.877 --> 02:05.478
We're just getting off
the Freeway.

02:05.512 --> 02:06.979
We're really close
to the Hospital.

02:07.014 --> 02:08.848
Sir!

02:08.882 --> 02:11.183
Silva! Sir, you need
to calm down!

02:11.218 --> 02:13.686
Silva, this guy's
out of control!

02:13.720 --> 02:14.920
Pull over!
I need your help!

02:14.955 --> 02:17.556
Rescue 35, we need backup.

02:21.561 --> 02:22.595
Silva!

02:24.898 --> 02:25.998
Sir!

02:26.033 --> 02:28.768
Sir, you need
to calm down.

02:28.802 --> 02:31.237
Sir, relax.
Sir, calm down.

02:31.271 --> 02:34.173
Relax, sir. Relax.

03:52.886 --> 03:54.653
Evening, Chief.

03:54.688 --> 03:56.088
Paramedics...

03:56.123 --> 03:58.491
Responding to a 911 call were
on their way to the Hospital

03:58.525 --> 04:00.126
when the guy
became combative.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.961
Four minutes later,
backup arrived,

04:01.995 --> 04:04.663
found them both dead from
multiple gunshot wounds.

04:04.698 --> 04:06.665
Any witnesses?
None.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.100
Air support was overhead
in five minutes.

04:08.135 --> 04:09.535
Didn't see anyone
within a mile radius.

04:09.569 --> 04:10.870
It's like the guy
just disappeared.

04:10.904 --> 04:12.671
The Fire Battalion Chief
told me that the Paramedics

04:12.706 --> 04:15.207
use only one route from
Elysian Park to the E.R.

04:15.242 --> 04:17.375
If the killer wasn't
just some transient

04:17.410 --> 04:18.878
and he really
planned this out,

04:18.911 --> 04:20.846
it's possible that
he had an accomplice here

04:20.880 --> 04:22.113
waiting
to drive him off.

04:22.149 --> 04:24.049
That accomplice could have been
our 911 caller.

04:24.084 --> 04:25.151
We're looking
for him now.

04:25.185 --> 04:26.552
Uh, anything taken
from the ambulance?

04:26.586 --> 04:28.053
No, both victims
still have their wallets.

04:28.088 --> 04:30.222
And I inventoried the vehicle
with an E.M.T.

04:30.257 --> 04:31.824
He says the only thing
that was missing

04:31.858 --> 04:33.726
were some towels that
the killer apparently used

04:33.760 --> 04:34.960
to wipe down
the crime scene.

04:34.995 --> 04:36.829
So someone posing
as a deranged homeless man

04:36.863 --> 04:38.397
kills two Paramedics,
takes nothing,

04:38.431 --> 04:41.400
cleans up after himself,
and vanishes?

04:41.434 --> 04:43.135
Chief, S.I.D. couldn't
pick up any good prints,

04:43.170 --> 04:44.737
but I found six casings.

04:44.771 --> 04:47.139
Thank you, Detective. Would you
run those over to NIBIN?
Yes, ma'am.

04:47.174 --> 04:49.742
Chief, this is the run sheet
the Paramedics used

04:49.776 --> 04:51.911
to record everything
before they pulled over.

04:51.945 --> 04:53.679
It says here
they performed

04:53.713 --> 04:56.081
a G.S. --
a Georgia Street lift.

04:56.116 --> 04:57.383
A what?

04:57.417 --> 04:59.351
Please?

04:59.386 --> 05:01.320
Gabriel,
could you get her legs?

05:01.354 --> 05:04.089
Her legs?
Turn around and just lean back on me.

05:04.124 --> 05:05.925
Ohh!

05:05.959 --> 05:09.728
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Okay. Thank you.

05:14.734 --> 05:16.702
Chief, there's something
I need to tell you.

05:16.736 --> 05:19.705
Chief, before you -- I --

05:19.739 --> 05:21.540
who removed
the bodies?!

05:21.575 --> 05:24.143
That's what I was trying
to tell you.

05:24.177 --> 05:26.946
The Fire Department took them
before we arrived.

05:26.980 --> 05:29.281
L.A.F.D. won't let
their people lie out dead --

05:29.316 --> 05:30.616
same as us --
out of respect.

05:30.650 --> 05:33.953
That respect may have just
cost us the investigation.

05:33.987 --> 05:35.588
Okay. The bodies
are at Good Samaritan.

05:35.622 --> 05:36.922
Where do you want them?

05:36.957 --> 05:38.791
Taken immediately to our morgue,
and I'll let you know

05:38.825 --> 05:40.526
exactly how I want them brought in.
All right.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.727
Detective.

05:46.132 --> 05:48.834
Just as you asked.

06:12.192 --> 06:14.226
Oh, God. Oh, God.

06:14.261 --> 06:15.361
Anna Vargas.

06:15.395 --> 06:17.363
You knew her?

06:17.397 --> 06:18.564
We're friends.

06:20.767 --> 06:21.867
Good friends.

06:21.902 --> 06:23.502
Oh, I'm so sorry,
doctor.

06:23.536 --> 06:25.337
Who did this?
I don't --
I don't know.

06:25.372 --> 06:27.206
Y-you don't need
to do the autopsy now.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.974
I'm only interested
in fingerprints.

06:29.009 --> 06:31.510
Uh, should I -- should
I take their gloves off?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:31.544 --> 06:33.212
I-I want the gloves left
exactly as they are.

06:33.246 --> 06:35.414
Please. Thank you.

06:35.448 --> 06:37.683
Lieutenant.

06:57.470 --> 07:00.272
All right.

07:00.307 --> 07:05.577
Thank you.

07:05.612 --> 07:08.781
See? The killer's fingerprints
were on her glove.

07:08.815 --> 07:10.816
This is why
we don't move bodies.

07:10.850 --> 07:12.484
The killer's name
was Kevin Mason,

07:12.519 --> 07:14.386
and those are
the fingerprints he submitted

07:14.421 --> 07:15.821
when he applied
to the L.A.F.D.

07:15.855 --> 07:17.489
I sure hope
he was rejected.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.959
Yeah, he was, four times --
the last time in 2007,

07:19.993 --> 07:22.394
which is when he seems
to have fallen off the map.

07:22.429 --> 07:24.863
Okay.
Thank you, Detective.

07:24.898 --> 07:26.699
Please run down all of
Mr. Mason's known addresses.

07:26.733 --> 07:28.067
Let's see
if we can find him.

07:28.101 --> 07:30.069
Chief,
the 911 cellphone --

07:30.103 --> 07:32.571
it turns out it's a prepaid job,
used for the first time tonight.

07:32.605 --> 07:34.173
Not only that,
it's got an FBI flag on it

07:34.207 --> 07:36.008
because it was purchased
along with another phone

07:36.042 --> 07:38.577
that was used in
an unsolved bombing attempt

07:38.611 --> 07:40.346
here in L.A.
two years back.

07:43.116 --> 07:44.750
A few years ago,
a bomb was left

07:44.784 --> 07:46.585
outside an I.R.S. Office
on Olympic.

07:46.619 --> 07:48.554
L.A.P.D. Counterterrorism
investigated.

07:48.588 --> 07:50.422
Tommy Delk turned it over
to the FBI.

07:50.457 --> 07:51.890
Chief.

07:53.927 --> 07:56.495
<i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

07:56.529 --> 07:58.430
<i>I'm in Elysian Park,</i>

07:58.465 --> 08:02.401
<i>and this guy's having</i>
<i>a-a epileptic fit or something.</i>

08:02.435 --> 08:04.136
<i>You should send somebody</i>
<i>right away.</i>

08:05.305 --> 08:07.840
<i>He's, uh --</i>
<i>he's up on Stadium Way.</i>

08:07.874 --> 08:09.842
It sounds like he's having
trouble catching his breath,

08:09.876 --> 08:12.244
just like the guy
the Paramedics picked up.

08:12.278 --> 08:15.581
Our 911 caller
could be our killer.

08:15.615 --> 08:17.983
Uh, so, how are
these murders connected

08:18.018 --> 08:20.352
to an attempted bombing
of an I.R.S. building?

08:22.355 --> 08:24.356
Look, Brenda, if these
were typical homicides,

08:24.391 --> 08:26.258
I would be happy to have you
pursue them on your own.

08:26.292 --> 08:28.927
Oh, you're not suggesting
I hand this case over to someone else?

08:28.962 --> 08:31.263
The murders are now connected to
an ongoing joint investigation

08:31.297 --> 08:34.332
between the FBI and our
own Counterterrorism Bureau

08:34.366 --> 08:36.034
led by Tommy Delk.

08:36.068 --> 08:37.403
Please note
the use of the words

08:37.437 --> 08:40.405
"terrorism"
and "Tommy Delk."

08:40.440 --> 08:42.508
What kind of a middle-aged man
calls himself Tommy?

08:43.777 --> 08:45.310
Oh!

08:45.345 --> 08:46.979
He's on the short list
for Chief.

08:47.013 --> 08:48.947
That's why you want me
to deal with him.

08:48.982 --> 08:50.949
No! T-t-this is
good police work.

08:50.984 --> 08:52.751
And the FBI has
already flagged that number,

08:52.786 --> 08:54.620
which means they're gonna
be showing up here.

08:54.654 --> 08:57.790
My advice is to put out
the welcome mat.

08:57.824 --> 08:59.792
I-I'd rather wait until
I have something to trade.

08:59.826 --> 09:01.794
You have fingerprints
and a name.

09:01.828 --> 09:03.295
Listen, I'll arrange
a sit-down with Delk.

09:03.329 --> 09:05.664
And he's got a little bit
of an ego on him,

09:05.698 --> 09:07.099
but he's not unreasonable.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.401
Only if he understands
that until I talk to him,

09:09.436 --> 09:11.036
he is not to speak
with the FBI.

09:11.071 --> 09:13.005
Believe me,
if these cases are connected,

09:13.039 --> 09:14.907
he's gonna be a huge help.

09:14.941 --> 09:17.910
If I find this 911 caller,
I won't need anyone's help.

09:17.944 --> 09:19.978
I've been trying to triangulate
the cellphone, Chief,

09:20.013 --> 09:21.413
but it's not pinging.

09:21.448 --> 09:23.282
Once the 911 caller
gets back online,

09:23.316 --> 09:25.217
it will show up
right here.

09:35.261 --> 09:37.262
I-I get how someone

09:37.297 --> 09:40.099
pretends to be disoriented
or mimics a seizure.

09:40.133 --> 09:41.300
But everything else
recorded here --

09:41.334 --> 09:43.302
accelerated heartbeat,
depressed respiration,

09:43.336 --> 09:45.137
dilated pupils --
how do you fake those?

09:50.810 --> 09:52.678
You can't.
According to the Paramedics' run sheet,

09:52.712 --> 09:54.012
these are the symptoms
he presented.

09:54.047 --> 09:56.281
While I'm waiting
for the phone to come back up,

09:56.316 --> 09:57.516
I'll look into it.

09:57.550 --> 09:59.384
<i>It was an exciting day</i>
<i>yesterday</i>

09:59.419 --> 10:00.953
<i>for a group of children</i>
<i>with cancer.</i>

10:00.987 --> 10:04.389
How is it
you're half my age

10:04.424 --> 10:08.494
and spend twice as much time
as me in the bathroom?

10:08.528 --> 10:10.596
I guess I'm just
a slower reader than you.

10:10.630 --> 10:12.631
Yeah.
Ready?

10:12.665 --> 10:14.133
Yeah. In a m--

10:14.167 --> 10:16.301
Okay.

10:16.336 --> 10:17.669
All right.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.971
Ready?
One, two, three.

10:20.507 --> 10:21.940
Here's my question --

10:21.975 --> 10:26.545
where is Kevin Mason hiding...

10:26.579 --> 10:28.547
For three years...

10:28.581 --> 10:30.315
Without being noticed?

10:30.350 --> 10:32.351
Let's go.

10:32.385 --> 10:33.785
And we're off.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.187
I don't know,
Lieutenant.

10:35.221 --> 10:38.957
But we better find him
before he disappears again.

10:50.501 --> 10:52.603
Ohh.
Good morning, Commander.
Good morning.

10:52.637 --> 10:54.104
Just thought
you should know,

10:54.138 --> 10:56.874
because the Paramedics' Memorial
is now scheduled for Monday,

10:56.908 --> 10:59.710
the announcement
for Chief

10:59.744 --> 11:02.179
will be delayed
until Tuesday.

11:02.213 --> 11:03.680
Also, uh --

11:03.715 --> 11:05.082
I got it.
Oh, thank you.

11:05.116 --> 11:07.517
Uh, Chief Pope

11:07.552 --> 11:10.621
has, uh, Delk in his office
waiting for you.

11:10.655 --> 11:11.922
And, uh --

11:11.956 --> 11:14.258
very good. Thank you.
Yes. Uh, yes. Uh --

11:14.292 --> 11:15.425
what is it, Commander?

11:15.460 --> 11:17.261
Well --

11:17.295 --> 11:20.564
Look, Delk will probably
have his own ideas

11:20.598 --> 11:23.500
for investigating the deaths
of Silva and Vargas.

11:23.534 --> 11:25.502
And you might want
to keep that in mind

11:25.536 --> 11:27.037
when collaborating
with him.

11:27.071 --> 11:29.239
You want me to play nicely
with Tommy Delk

11:29.274 --> 11:31.441
in case he becomes
Chief of Police.

11:31.476 --> 11:34.912
All I'm saying is that in
addition to your two victims,

11:34.946 --> 11:38.282
there are several still-living
people counting on you.

11:38.316 --> 11:41.418
Well, thank you for the vote
of confidence, Commander.

11:42.387 --> 11:44.154
Good morning...
Morning.

11:44.188 --> 11:47.224
...Chief Johnson.

11:48.493 --> 11:49.993
Come in.

11:51.095 --> 11:53.597
Chief Johnson,
I believe you've met.

11:53.631 --> 11:54.965
Tommy Delk.

11:54.999 --> 11:56.466
Good to see you again.
And you.

11:56.501 --> 11:58.502
Let's get started,
shall we?

11:59.570 --> 12:01.004
Okay.

12:02.941 --> 12:05.976
Two years ago today,
September 24th,

12:06.010 --> 12:07.744
a stolen pickup was left

12:07.779 --> 12:09.813
outside a Federal Office
on West Olympic.

12:09.847 --> 12:12.015
Its flatbed contained
a small explosive

12:12.050 --> 12:14.818
and a barrel filled with
fertilizer and diesel fuel.

12:14.852 --> 12:16.320
The explosive ignited

12:16.354 --> 12:18.288
but failed to set off
the larger bomb,

12:18.323 --> 12:20.490
and a phone wired to the barrel
as a backup detonator

12:20.525 --> 12:23.493
also failed because the battery
had lost its charge.

12:23.528 --> 12:25.228
Well, that's lucky.
Yeah, for everyone.

12:25.263 --> 12:26.596
If that bomb had exploded,

12:26.631 --> 12:29.166
it would have taken down
half the I.R.S. building.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.668
Unfortunately,
as far as evidence went,

12:31.703 --> 12:33.470
everything was untraceable,
including the truck.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.906
We did recover
footage of the suspect

12:35.940 --> 12:37.274
buying two prepaid phones,

12:37.308 --> 12:39.276
one of which was
the backup detonator.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.645
But the video's poor quality
made it impossible

12:41.679 --> 12:43.580
for us or the FBI
to identify him.

12:43.614 --> 12:45.716
I would very much like
to view that footage.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.018
The FBI has already
made it available to you,

12:48.052 --> 12:49.619
along with the rest
of its findings.

12:49.654 --> 12:51.855
I-I'm sorry -- you've already
contacted the FBI?

12:51.889 --> 12:53.657
I-I specifically requested

12:53.691 --> 12:57.160
that you not discuss anything
with them until we had spoken.

12:57.195 --> 12:59.062
Chief Pope
mentioned that.

12:59.097 --> 13:01.531
You understand I'm in constant
communication with the Feds

13:01.566 --> 13:03.266
and couldn't consider
doing anything

13:03.301 --> 13:05.035
that would make me
less than trustworthy.

13:05.069 --> 13:08.205
As you may know, I'm somewhat
connected to the FBI myself.

13:08.239 --> 13:09.806
Yeah, uh,
if I could just --

13:09.841 --> 13:11.675
I don't know what
you've shared with the FBI,

13:11.709 --> 13:13.377
but I need to examine
the materials

13:13.411 --> 13:15.545
connected to that previous
bombing case immediately.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.614
Sure, and I'll tell you
what you'll find -- Jack.

13:17.648 --> 13:19.649
We had the case for three
months, and we found Jack.

13:19.684 --> 13:22.452
The FBI had it for 21 months,
and they found Jack.

13:22.487 --> 13:24.154
Well, you and the FBI
may not have found Jack,

13:24.188 --> 13:25.522
but I did,
and his name isn't Jack!

13:25.556 --> 13:28.592
Really?
Y-y-you've found him?

13:28.626 --> 13:30.861
Which means that I've had this case for
less than eight hours,

13:30.895 --> 13:33.130
and I'm already farther along than you
and the FBI after two years.

13:33.164 --> 13:36.266
To be fair, you did have the
benefit of new fingerprints.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.734
I'd be curious

13:37.769 --> 13:39.603
how much farther you'll get
in the next three hours.
Three hours?

13:39.637 --> 13:41.471
Because that's how long
the FBI has agreed

13:41.506 --> 13:43.473
to share their material
before they take over your case.

13:43.508 --> 13:44.875
That's what's
been arranged.

13:44.909 --> 13:46.343
I did not agree to that.

13:46.377 --> 13:48.512
Well, it's a good thing
I'm not taking orders from <i>you.</i>

13:48.546 --> 13:52.282
Yeah, believe it or not,
I'm actually in charge here.

13:52.316 --> 13:53.984
At least for
the next few days.

13:54.018 --> 13:56.053
And since this case
seems to be more serious

13:56.087 --> 13:57.721
than we first imagined,
Chief Johnson,

13:57.755 --> 13:59.156
I'm sure you would like
the FBI

13:59.190 --> 14:02.259
to have the benefit
of your analysis.

14:02.293 --> 14:05.695
And I would like the two of you
to work together amicably.

14:05.730 --> 14:09.533
You'll inform the FBI
about Kevin Mason,

14:09.567 --> 14:11.168
and we will proceed
as arranged,

14:11.202 --> 14:12.536
with Chief Delk present

14:12.570 --> 14:14.371
while major crimes
examines the files.

14:14.405 --> 14:17.407
And then three hours from now,
it's the FBI's ballgame.

14:17.442 --> 14:18.875
Is that clear to everyone?
Sir.

14:18.910 --> 14:19.876
Yes.

14:19.911 --> 14:20.944
Thank you.

14:31.055 --> 14:33.957
Why'd I buy some fancy damn
electric wheelchair

14:33.991 --> 14:36.760
if it's always
out for repair?

14:36.794 --> 14:39.729
Told you I'd have your chair
fixed in three days.
Yeah.

14:39.764 --> 14:43.033
Until then, you should be enjoying the world's
most overqualified chauffeur.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.234
Yeah.
Here, hold this.

14:44.268 --> 14:46.103
All right.

14:46.137 --> 14:47.871
Ready? One, two, three.
Yeah. Here we go.

14:47.905 --> 14:51.675
All right, easy, now.

14:57.615 --> 14:59.616
Whew.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.519
Give me the remote.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.188
Yeah, I got it.

15:05.223 --> 15:08.024
<i>Given the recent budget cuts,</i>
<i>it's expected that the programs</i>

15:08.059 --> 15:10.494
<i>will be phased out</i>
<i>over the next three months</i>

15:10.528 --> 15:14.397
<i>unless emergency funding</i>
<i>is approved in Sacramento.</i>

15:14.432 --> 15:16.466
<i>Well, the entire</i>
<i>Southern California community</i>

15:16.501 --> 15:19.136
<i>is in mourning,</i>
<i>as two Paramedics lay dead.</i>

15:19.170 --> 15:20.871
<i>Anna Vargas, 35,</i>

15:20.905 --> 15:24.641
<i>and Anthony Silva, 39,</i>
<i>father of three...</i>

15:24.675 --> 15:26.810
You wanted to work
for the Fire Department.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.912
<i>...Elysian Park area</i>
<i>at approximately 1:00 A.M...</i>

15:28.946 --> 15:30.113
That could've been you.

15:30.148 --> 15:32.082
<i>...Believed</i>
<i>to be a man in his 40's</i>

15:32.116 --> 15:33.383
<i>allegedly pulled a firearm</i>

15:33.417 --> 15:35.919
<i>and shot both Paramedics</i>
<i>several times,</i>

15:35.953 --> 15:37.821
<i>killing them instantly.</i>

15:37.855 --> 15:40.724
You said when the small
explosive ignited

15:40.758 --> 15:42.893
in front of
the I.R.S. building,

15:42.927 --> 15:44.728
the responding Firemen
came from a nearby station?

15:44.762 --> 15:46.263
Firehouse Number 59.

15:46.297 --> 15:47.964
It's right -- right there.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.399
That's not nearby.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.401
It's practically
across the street.

15:51.435 --> 15:53.837
Which is why the fire was
extinguished so quickly.

15:53.871 --> 15:58.408
Okay, and this happened
at 6:33 A.M.

15:58.442 --> 16:00.977
Okay, so, the FBI thinks
some guy is smart enough

16:01.012 --> 16:03.346
to build a bomb
from untraceable parts,

16:03.381 --> 16:05.715
but then sloppy enough
to leave it

16:05.750 --> 16:07.784
right across the street
from a firehouse?

16:07.818 --> 16:09.019
Maybe he didn't
notice that.

16:09.053 --> 16:10.754
I'm thinking
he notices everything.

16:10.788 --> 16:15.559
All L.A.F.D. stations
change shifts at 6:30 A.M.

16:15.593 --> 16:17.427
30 firefighters,
2 full crews,

16:17.461 --> 16:20.030
could have responded
to that first explosive.

16:20.064 --> 16:23.200
Whoa.
Well, wait a minute.

16:23.234 --> 16:25.535
Are you suggesting that...

16:25.570 --> 16:29.172
Whoever left the truck
wasn't aiming at the I.R.S.?

16:29.207 --> 16:31.541
No, he wasn't.
A-and I don't believe

16:31.576 --> 16:33.643
that the small explosion was
a detonator for a larger bomb.

16:33.678 --> 16:35.879
It was bait to attract
first responders.

16:35.913 --> 16:39.015
So you think
the failed cellphone

16:39.050 --> 16:40.650
was the primary,
not the backup.

16:40.685 --> 16:43.286
This person was looking to kill
as many firemen as possible.

16:43.321 --> 16:46.223
So, assuming
that Kevin Mason

16:46.257 --> 16:48.391
engineered the first
September 24th attack,

16:48.426 --> 16:51.695
why would he resurface
to kill only two firemen

16:51.729 --> 16:54.164
when he previously aimed
to kill dozens?

16:54.198 --> 16:57.033
Maybe shooting Silva and Vargas
was the inciting incident,

16:57.068 --> 16:59.603
the small explosion
leading to a larger one.

17:00.838 --> 17:03.473
Brenda, Chief Delk.

17:03.507 --> 17:04.741
Good to see you both.

17:04.775 --> 17:07.243
And you, Agent Howard.

17:07.278 --> 17:10.180
As previously agreed,
our people are here to, uh,

17:10.214 --> 17:12.082
take this investigation
off your hands.

17:12.116 --> 17:14.684
Well, as it so happens, Chief Delk
and I have been re-evaluating the case,

17:14.719 --> 17:16.886
and we both think that --

17:16.921 --> 17:18.655
that we should keep
our arrangement with the FBI

17:18.689 --> 17:20.490
and our end of the bargain.

17:22.441 --> 17:23.708
Your files.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.914
There were
bullet casings.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.282
NIBIN's got them.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.483
But it's taking six hours

17:32.518 --> 17:34.252
for every year they go back
in their database.

17:34.286 --> 17:35.953
As soon
as they record a hit,

17:35.988 --> 17:38.289
I'll forward the findings.
Thank you.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.263
Yes.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.167
Gosh, I'm sorry, Chief.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.102
I thought we were
on the same page.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.870
For two years the FBI
has been investigating

17:52.905 --> 17:54.405
a federal attack
on an I.R.S. Office.

17:54.439 --> 17:55.773
Now, even if you're right,

17:55.807 --> 17:57.909
and Mason was aiming
at the firemen,

17:57.943 --> 17:59.343
they'd be too embarrassed

17:59.378 --> 18:02.113
to admit they were on
the wrong track for so long.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.015
So we just give the case
back to them?

18:04.049 --> 18:06.117
We couldn't have said anything
to change what just happened.

18:06.151 --> 18:09.353
But now the FBI can do
what they do best --

18:09.388 --> 18:11.322
find the missing fugitive --

18:11.356 --> 18:15.826
while we use the resources
of our combined divisions

18:15.861 --> 18:17.495
to investigate
your crazy idea

18:17.529 --> 18:18.663
that the murdered Paramedics

18:18.697 --> 18:23.501
were just the first casualties
of a larger assault.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.939
So...

18:27.973 --> 18:31.409
You don't want
to tell the FBI

18:31.443 --> 18:33.711
that Mason was aiming
for the fire department?

18:33.745 --> 18:37.949
It's an untested hypothesis.
It would just confuse them.

18:39.218 --> 18:40.651
I don't think we'd want

18:40.686 --> 18:43.321
to send the FBI on
a wild-goose chase, no?

18:44.523 --> 18:46.958
Oh, no, we wouldn't
want to do that.

18:58.074 --> 18:59.808
I think we should consider

18:59.843 --> 19:02.077
that this Mason guy is going
underground for a while.

19:02.112 --> 19:06.482
Tao or someone has been staring
at that grid since Friday

19:06.516 --> 19:10.319
just waiting for our 911 caller
to show up online.

19:10.353 --> 19:13.188
If someone had been
given this assignment

19:13.223 --> 19:14.389
after the first incident,

19:14.424 --> 19:16.758
they'd have been sitting there
now for two years.

19:18.061 --> 19:20.362
Chief, the shrink who performed
Mason's last evaluation

19:20.396 --> 19:23.899
is in interview 2.

19:23.933 --> 19:25.734
Mind if I join you?

19:28.638 --> 19:30.939
Of course.

19:30.974 --> 19:33.876
It's right this way.

19:46.990 --> 19:49.391
Do me a favor,
will you, huh?

19:49.425 --> 19:52.694
Explain why
it's been three days

19:52.729 --> 19:55.898
and I still don't have
my damn wheelchair!

19:55.932 --> 19:57.599
You have a wheelchair, Russ.
It works just fine.

19:57.634 --> 19:59.101
I want my <i>electric</i>
<i>wheelchair!</i>

19:59.135 --> 20:00.702
And if you're not gonna
give it back,

20:00.737 --> 20:02.571
I'll do something
about it.

20:02.605 --> 20:05.641
Mrs. Whitley will get
to the bottom of this.

20:06.809 --> 20:09.011
If not,
I'll call the police.

20:11.347 --> 20:13.682
You're just crazy enough
to do it, aren't you?

20:18.087 --> 20:21.390
Did you just
call me crazy?

20:21.424 --> 20:23.158
What are you doing?

20:23.193 --> 20:24.893
Just relax.
O-only what I have to.
What?

20:24.928 --> 20:26.895
Just relax.
What?

20:26.930 --> 20:28.330
Relax.

20:28.364 --> 20:30.098
Relax.

20:31.768 --> 20:33.969
What -- what --

20:34.003 --> 20:35.270
aah! Aah!

20:44.514 --> 20:46.915
<i>Dr. Wechsler,</i>
<i>I understand you performed</i>

20:46.950 --> 20:50.652
a psychiatric evaluation
for a Mr. Kevin Mason

20:50.687 --> 20:55.724
when he applied to the L.A.F.D.
In 2005 and 2007.

20:55.758 --> 20:58.460
Does this picture
jog your memory any?

21:00.496 --> 21:03.432
<i>I remember my sessions</i>
<i>with him, yes.</i>

21:05.368 --> 21:07.002
<i>As you realize...</i>

21:07.036 --> 21:09.638
<i>Public safety trumps</i>
<i>confidentiality.</i>

21:09.672 --> 21:11.106
What do you need to know?

21:11.140 --> 21:14.176
Anything that could help us
understand his psyche.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.151
T-there's
a standard set of questions

21:23.186 --> 21:25.621
that we ask
all applicants.

21:25.655 --> 21:28.390
And the inappropriateness
of Mr. Mason's responses

21:28.424 --> 21:29.858
was immediately apparent.

21:29.892 --> 21:31.460
Can you be more specific?

21:31.494 --> 21:33.462
When I ask someone,

21:33.496 --> 21:35.230
"what's your idea
of the perfect day?"

21:35.265 --> 21:38.900
Most people say going to the
beach with their girlfriend,

21:38.935 --> 21:40.302
that sort of thing.

21:40.336 --> 21:41.603
And Mr. Mason's
perfect day?

21:44.407 --> 21:48.977
It involved discovering a threat
to a local suspension bridge

21:49.012 --> 21:51.747
and his showing up
to save thousands of lives.

21:51.781 --> 21:54.983
No doubt the state-controlled
media are proclaiming

21:55.018 --> 21:58.387
that the thousands of dead
police officers and firemen

21:58.421 --> 21:59.921
are innocent victims!

21:59.956 --> 22:03.025
My diagnosis was narcissistic
personality disorder.

22:03.059 --> 22:05.427
But they are not blameless.
But they are not blameless.

22:05.461 --> 22:08.463
The pathology is determined
by numerous criteria --

22:08.498 --> 22:09.798
uh, does this person

22:09.832 --> 22:12.334
have excessive feelings
of entitlement?

22:12.368 --> 22:14.536
They embodied the perversion
of the natural order!

22:14.570 --> 22:17.606
Are they preoccupied
with fantasies of power?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.841
They were defenders
of a corrupt system!

22:19.876 --> 22:22.110
I was merely a-an object

22:22.145 --> 22:24.579
in a system he felt
was stacked against him

22:24.614 --> 22:26.848
because he's white.

22:26.883 --> 22:28.784
<i>Mr. Mason was convinced</i>
<i>that's why</i>

22:28.818 --> 22:31.753
<i>he was repeatedly rejected</i>
<i>by the fire department.</i>

22:33.156 --> 22:36.191
And how would you handle
someone with this pathology?

22:36.225 --> 22:37.459
Carefully.

22:37.493 --> 22:40.629
This is a man who doesn't think
he makes mistakes.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.631
They embody the na--

22:42.665 --> 22:44.466
and contradiction can trigger
a violent reaction.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.869
He imagines himself
top of the food chain...

22:47.904 --> 22:49.938
I am the first wave.
...Without peer...

22:49.972 --> 22:51.406
I am the first wave.

22:51.441 --> 22:52.474
Delusions of grandeur.

22:52.508 --> 22:53.775
I am the first wave.

22:53.810 --> 22:55.744
I am the first wave,
first wave...

22:55.778 --> 22:58.980
Of the new flood
that washes it all away.

22:59.015 --> 23:01.883
...Meaning whatever you're
thinking Mason might do...

23:03.553 --> 23:05.020
...Think bigger.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.324
Chief, I just did
an Internet search,

23:42.358 --> 23:45.193
and September 24th
was the day in 1965

23:45.228 --> 23:47.496
when President Johnson
signed his Executive Order

23:47.530 --> 23:51.032
directing government contractors
to enforce affirmative action.

23:51.067 --> 23:54.302
September 24th.
Affirmative Action Day.

23:54.337 --> 23:56.638
So Mr. Mason
is a man with a gripe.

23:56.672 --> 23:59.641
Chief, we got a hit
on the casings.

23:59.675 --> 24:01.009
14 years ago,

24:01.043 --> 24:02.611
a Russell Owens
of Sherman Oaks

24:02.645 --> 24:04.713
took a shot at an intruder
with his .45.

24:04.747 --> 24:05.881
And where
is Mr. Owens today?

24:05.915 --> 24:07.249
Well, he was
71 years old then, Chief.

24:07.283 --> 24:08.784
We don't even know
if he's still alive.

24:08.818 --> 24:11.820
Neighbors said he was
kind of a crank, moved
away maybe 10 years ago.

24:11.854 --> 24:14.289
If Owens collects
Social Security,

24:14.323 --> 24:15.824
we can find out where
he's getting his checks.

24:15.858 --> 24:17.793
Good idea.
All right.

24:17.827 --> 24:20.729
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, who are you calling?

24:20.763 --> 24:23.965
We have to let the FBI know
about the casings.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.067
Oh, I happen to know
the FBI is asleep right now.

24:26.102 --> 24:28.937
And there's no point in calling
until we verify this.

24:28.971 --> 24:30.539
Remember, y-you said
you didn't want

24:30.573 --> 24:32.140
to send them
on a wild-goose chase.

24:45.588 --> 24:48.156
Mr. Owens! Mr. Owens!

24:48.191 --> 24:50.625
Open it up.

24:50.660 --> 24:53.195
Mr. Owens,
it's time for breakfast!

24:53.229 --> 24:55.764
Are you up?

24:55.798 --> 24:58.533
Mr. Owens?

24:58.568 --> 25:01.236
Tao!

25:07.643 --> 25:10.045
Dead. And cold.

25:10.079 --> 25:12.180
How convenient.
Okay, the woman
that manages the place

25:12.215 --> 25:15.016
says there's an attendant
that spends most of his time

25:15.051 --> 25:16.952
with Mr. Owens, and he was here
last night -- Bob Gill.

25:16.986 --> 25:19.054
Look familiar?

25:20.223 --> 25:21.490
Lieutenant Flynn.

25:21.524 --> 25:23.558
Chief, we're at the
assisted living center.

25:23.593 --> 25:25.060
And we found
Russell Owens.

25:25.094 --> 25:26.228
He's dead.

25:26.262 --> 25:27.362
You'll never guess

25:27.396 --> 25:29.064
who the attendant
taking care of him was.

25:29.098 --> 25:31.900
Kevin Mason. Have you found him
yet? Did you make an arrest?

25:31.934 --> 25:35.470
No, no, not yet. But we have
a recent I.D. photo of him.

25:35.505 --> 25:38.340
Yeah. Hold on.

25:39.942 --> 25:43.378
Chief, yeah,
I've got an M1911 Colt .45,

25:43.412 --> 25:44.946
semiautomatic.

25:44.981 --> 25:47.482
I'm pretty sure it was used
to shoot the Paramedics.

25:47.517 --> 25:49.584
And tell her I found
an anticholinergic --

25:49.619 --> 25:50.952
oxybutynin.

25:50.987 --> 25:52.454
Uh, uh,
Tao says he's got some --

25:52.488 --> 25:54.055
well, he's got some, um --

25:54.090 --> 25:55.590
he's got, uh, cholera.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.759
Uh, or, what'd you say?

25:57.793 --> 25:58.727
Anticholinergic.

25:58.761 --> 26:00.662
Ah, Detective! Oop.

26:01.931 --> 26:03.865
Chief, I found about
20 bottles of oxybutynin.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.433
It's a bladder-control
medication.

26:05.468 --> 26:08.436
And that's important
because?

26:08.471 --> 26:10.839
Well, in higher doses,
the side effects of oxybutynin

26:10.873 --> 26:12.641
are increased heart rate,
depressed respiration,

26:12.675 --> 26:13.808
dilated pupils.

26:13.843 --> 26:15.277
All the symptoms
Mason had

26:15.311 --> 26:17.012
when our victims
picked him up.

26:17.046 --> 26:19.247
Why would Mason
need 20 bottles

26:19.282 --> 26:21.016
of oxy-whatever
to fool the Paramedics?

26:21.050 --> 26:22.617
I don't know,
but it seems like

26:22.652 --> 26:24.920
he stole a bottle from
every patient in the place.

26:24.954 --> 26:28.123
And you know what? There
seems to be a couple of
missing oxygen tanks.

26:28.157 --> 26:30.358
Wait a minute.
Is Kevin Mason there or not?

26:30.393 --> 26:33.094
Chief, Kevin Mason,
A.K.A. Bob Gill,

26:33.129 --> 26:35.530
clocked out of work about
two hours before we got here.

26:35.565 --> 26:37.165
Y-y-yeah, Chief.

26:37.199 --> 26:38.867
Uh, Chief,
but Mason has access

26:38.901 --> 26:40.435
to a van
that's currently missing.

26:40.469 --> 26:42.270
Okay, uh
scan and release his I.D.,

26:42.305 --> 26:44.573
run the plates
on the vehicle he stole.

26:44.607 --> 26:46.741
And let's get everyone we can
looking for that van.

26:46.776 --> 26:48.109
Kevin Mason's up to something.

26:48.144 --> 26:49.844
I'm sorry, Chief,
but the nurses are asking

26:49.879 --> 26:52.581
if we have any idea of when we'll be done
with this guy's body.

26:52.615 --> 26:54.482
I guess they're already
thinking about his funeral.

26:55.851 --> 26:57.285
His funeral.

27:00.990 --> 27:03.458
The Memorial for the Paramedics.
When is it?

27:04.894 --> 27:07.629
It's about four hours
from now.

27:07.663 --> 27:08.730
Why?

27:11.601 --> 27:13.001
That's the bigger event.

27:14.036 --> 27:16.771
He killed the Paramedics
in order to bomb the funeral.

27:34.665 --> 27:38.101
Chief, we've got
flyers of the van and Mason

27:38.136 --> 27:39.469
in every patrol car.

27:39.504 --> 27:40.937
And the status
of the roadblocks?

27:40.972 --> 27:42.105
Well, they're already up

27:42.140 --> 27:44.941
on Jefferson, Figueroa,
and West Adams.

27:44.976 --> 27:46.977
Uh, they're going up now
on Hoover and Flower.

27:47.011 --> 27:48.612
And what about
the bomb sweeps?

27:48.646 --> 27:51.548
The techs just finished inside the Cathedral.
So far, nothing.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.383
Good. That ought to
ease your mind a little.

27:53.418 --> 27:55.485
Actually, Commander,
the fact that we can't find

27:55.520 --> 27:56.987
Mr. Mason or his van
or the bomb

27:57.021 --> 27:59.122
makes me want to cancel
this Memorial altogether.

27:59.157 --> 28:00.690
Eh, you're overreacting.

28:00.725 --> 28:02.759
When Mason shot
those two Paramedics,

28:02.794 --> 28:04.461
he wiped
the ambulance clean,

28:04.495 --> 28:07.464
despite knowing that police
backup was seconds away.

28:07.498 --> 28:09.533
Chief, we all know
how methodical Mason is.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.468
No, how methodical
he <i>was.</i>

28:11.502 --> 28:13.303
This morning
he left out everything,

28:13.337 --> 28:15.105
including the gun he used
to kill Vargas and Silva,

28:15.139 --> 28:16.873
where he knew
we wouldi find it.

28:16.908 --> 28:19.643
He no longer cares about what
evidence we have against him.

28:19.677 --> 28:21.611
He's on a suicide mission,
and he is out

28:21.646 --> 28:22.779
to bomb that church.

28:22.814 --> 28:24.381
All right, and how would
he accomplish that?

28:27.251 --> 28:29.352
Even if he has turned his van turned into
some kind of a car bomb,

28:29.387 --> 28:31.121
there's a perimeter
of primary barriers

28:31.155 --> 28:33.256
covering more than an
eight-square-block radius.

28:33.291 --> 28:36.059
And no doubt Mason has already found
some way around that. I'm positive.

28:36.094 --> 28:37.561
And then he
will be stopped

28:37.595 --> 28:39.463
by our roadblocks.

28:39.497 --> 28:41.264
And if he's not
stopped there,

28:41.299 --> 28:42.732
we'll get his van
in a grid search.

28:42.767 --> 28:44.634
We can defend ourselves.

28:44.669 --> 28:46.603
There's no metal detectors
in that church.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.372
We don't need metal detectors.
Besides, we can't use them --

28:49.407 --> 28:51.942
not with thousands of armed
officers in attendance.

28:51.976 --> 28:53.944
More like thousands
of potential victims.

28:53.978 --> 28:55.112
Not only are there

28:55.146 --> 28:57.047
3,000 fire-department employees
on that line,

28:57.081 --> 28:59.382
but we've got hundreds
of police officers,

28:59.417 --> 29:00.617
the Mayor,
<i>and</i> the Governor.

29:00.651 --> 29:01.651
Chief Johnson,

29:01.686 --> 29:03.487
the Memorial begins
in 40 minutes.

29:03.521 --> 29:06.790
If you really want to call
this off, it's now or never.

29:12.330 --> 29:14.431
Can I have a moment?

29:16.968 --> 29:18.468
Two years ago,
Kevin Mason failed

29:18.503 --> 29:19.803
because of
a dead cellphone,

29:19.837 --> 29:21.905
but this time I'm convinced
he's better prepared,

29:21.939 --> 29:23.507
and it's going to be
a catastrophe.

29:23.541 --> 29:25.909
If you cancel this funeral
and no bomb is found,

29:25.943 --> 29:27.711
you will embarrass
the department,

29:27.745 --> 29:29.312
and you will
never be Chief.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.149
I'll risk it.

29:33.551 --> 29:34.885
No, you won't.

29:35.987 --> 29:38.655
Everyone, I'm canceling this
Memorial until further notice!

29:39.857 --> 29:41.258
My decision!

29:47.832 --> 29:48.999
Chief,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

29:49.033 --> 29:50.667
but, uh, Flynn's
with the grid search,

29:50.701 --> 29:52.869
and he's found something
that you need to know about.

29:52.904 --> 29:54.271
Uh, Lieutenant Flynn?

29:54.305 --> 29:55.705
Chief,
you can nix the idea

29:55.740 --> 29:58.108
that Mason was using
the van as a bomb.

29:58.142 --> 29:59.643
I'm looking at it now.
It's empty.

29:59.677 --> 30:01.011
Nothing in it at all?

30:01.045 --> 30:03.613
There's an envelope
on the front seat

30:03.648 --> 30:08.151
with the words "to the m..."
on it, and a DVD inside.

30:08.186 --> 30:09.986
What? Lieutenant Flynn,
I can't hear you.

30:10.021 --> 30:12.522
You're breaking up.
We're on our way d--

30:12.557 --> 30:14.558
thank you.

30:14.592 --> 30:16.993
Detective Sanchez,
Detective Gabriel,
with me, please.

30:17.028 --> 30:19.496
This way.

30:21.032 --> 30:23.500
Morning.
This way, please.

30:25.503 --> 30:27.771
This way.

30:31.676 --> 30:34.344
This way, please.

30:35.913 --> 30:38.481
This way.

30:38.516 --> 30:40.083
Excuse me, sir.

30:40.117 --> 30:41.585
W-what's going on?

30:41.619 --> 30:43.486
The Memorial's
been cancelled.

30:45.323 --> 30:47.023
Are you okay?

30:47.058 --> 30:48.625
Can I give you a hand?

31:06.577 --> 31:08.979
Oh, man.

31:17.021 --> 31:19.823
P5, please.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.861
God bless you
for your service.

31:24.895 --> 31:28.298
Thank you very much.
You're very welcome.

31:29.467 --> 31:32.035
Here you go, Chief.

31:32.069 --> 31:33.903
"Beyond
wrath & tears." Oh, my.

31:33.938 --> 31:36.640
They're sending a laptop over
so we can watch it.

31:36.674 --> 31:40.043
It should be here
in a minute.

31:50.254 --> 31:53.690
Yes, and detain anyone
traveling in a wheelchair.

31:53.724 --> 31:56.126
Uhh, hang on.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.727
Chief Johnson.

31:57.762 --> 32:00.563
Chief, I think I know why Mason kept the
stockpile of oxybutynin.

32:00.598 --> 32:02.565
Quickly, Lieutenant.
I'm five floors underground.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.600
I could lose you
any second.

32:03.634 --> 32:05.068
Oxybutynin
works like atropine.

32:05.102 --> 32:07.237
It's an antidote
to nerve poison.

32:07.271 --> 32:09.072
And I think Mason
used the bladder meds

32:09.106 --> 32:10.473
to protect himself
while making nerve gas.

32:10.508 --> 32:12.142
...Oxygen tanks...

32:12.176 --> 32:14.110
I'm guessing he filled them
with something like Sarin.

32:14.145 --> 32:16.246
Lieutenant,
you're breaking up.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.614
The tanks are filled
with what?

32:19.684 --> 32:21.284
I think the tanks
are filled with Sarin!

32:21.319 --> 32:22.419
Nerve gas.

32:22.453 --> 32:23.887
The Nazis invented it!

32:23.921 --> 32:25.555
Do I need to say
anything more?!

32:27.692 --> 32:30.293
A tiny amount
in an enclosed space --

32:30.328 --> 32:31.795
Chief?!

32:31.829 --> 32:32.996
We got to go.

32:34.432 --> 32:37.567
Lieutenant, I can't hear you!
Lieutenant --

33:17.308 --> 33:19.609
unh! Get up!

33:19.643 --> 33:22.278
Whoa! Stay back!
He's got a bomb, Chief.
He's wearing a bomb.

33:22.313 --> 33:23.847
Do you know what
a dead-man switch is?

33:23.881 --> 33:25.115
I let go of this,
we all die!

33:25.149 --> 33:28.251
Mason! Kevin Mason?

33:28.285 --> 33:30.253
You know who I am?

33:30.287 --> 33:31.888
Of course I do.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.556
You're the fugitive
w-who's outsmarted

33:33.591 --> 33:35.625
the L.A.P.D., the FBI,

33:35.659 --> 33:37.460
and God knows who else
over the last two years.

33:37.495 --> 33:39.562
Right now you're the most
wanted man in the world.

33:39.597 --> 33:40.930
I've seen you on tv?

33:43.267 --> 33:46.136
Yeah! That's it! You're up
to be the next Chief of Police!

33:46.170 --> 33:47.637
I've been offered the job.

33:47.671 --> 33:50.039
So, here we are --

33:50.074 --> 33:51.775
the next Chief
of the country's

33:51.809 --> 33:53.009
largest police force

33:53.043 --> 33:55.645
face-to-face with America's
leading dissident.

33:55.679 --> 33:58.815
N.Y.P.D. Is America's
largest police force.

33:58.849 --> 34:01.217
Maybe we should keep our egos
in check, shall we?

34:01.252 --> 34:02.552
No, no, no, no!
Don't shoot!

34:02.586 --> 34:04.087
Don't shoot!
I want him alive.

34:06.490 --> 34:08.625
Why do you want me alive?

34:08.659 --> 34:11.226
Law enforcement has so much
to learn from a mind like yours.

34:11.262 --> 34:13.096
A-a-and judging
from this...

34:15.399 --> 34:16.966
You watched my Manifesto?

34:17.001 --> 34:18.635
I did.

34:18.668 --> 34:22.338
What part
did you like the most?

34:23.373 --> 34:24.607
Specifically.

34:25.876 --> 34:28.143
The articulate way
you described

34:28.179 --> 34:31.047
how the events of September 24th
affect our everyday lives.

34:31.081 --> 34:33.183
A-and I agree entirely

34:33.217 --> 34:37.085
about how badly the quota system
has undermined our values.

34:37.121 --> 34:39.789
B-but what
I don't understand is --

34:39.824 --> 34:42.559
is why you felt the need
to kill those Paramedics.

34:42.592 --> 34:44.226
Well, if you had been
paying attention,

34:44.261 --> 34:45.628
you would' heard
when I said

34:45.663 --> 34:47.263
they were part
of a corrupt structure.

34:47.297 --> 34:49.632
Oh, right. Right.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.668
B-b-but what about
Russell Owens?

34:51.702 --> 34:52.936
H-he was an invalid.

34:52.969 --> 34:54.838
He threatened my mission.

34:54.871 --> 34:57.307
And all the people
at the Memorial?

34:57.341 --> 34:58.908
Is it really necessary
to kill them?

34:58.943 --> 35:02.212
Well, I'm sorry
if it seems so brutal,

35:02.246 --> 35:05.148
but I'm holding our
society's hand to the stove.

35:05.182 --> 35:07.851
Sometimes violence
is the only way

35:07.885 --> 35:09.419
to teach people
how wrong they are.

35:09.453 --> 35:10.887
What, you don't think
I see you running?!

35:14.058 --> 35:16.826
There goes another one of your
cowardly Hispanic quota hires.

35:16.861 --> 35:18.595
It's okay.
Don't worry about him.

35:19.797 --> 35:22.665
Just for the record,
I am not racist.

35:22.700 --> 35:23.967
The <i>system</i> is racist.

35:24.001 --> 35:25.869
A system I will change
as Chief.

35:25.903 --> 35:28.471
Are you just saying that to save yourself?
Because you're expendable!

35:28.506 --> 35:29.672
Okay, you know what?

35:30.908 --> 35:33.510
Why don't you just let them go,
all right?

35:33.544 --> 35:36.246
Just let them go.
You can hold onto me.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.847
Okay?

35:37.882 --> 35:39.782
Now, what about
your Manifesto?!

35:39.817 --> 35:42.151
If you kill us,
you destroy your Manifesto.

35:42.186 --> 35:44.454
On the other hand, if you let these men
deactivate your bomb,

35:44.488 --> 35:47.490
not only will your
powerful speech survive,

35:47.525 --> 35:48.691
but you can
give it yourself.

35:48.726 --> 35:51.127
You've already accomplished
your mission.

35:51.161 --> 35:52.462
People are listening
to you.

35:52.496 --> 35:54.430
Journalists will be <i>begging</i>
<i>for interviews.</i>

35:54.465 --> 35:56.766
You'll be studied
in history classes,

35:56.800 --> 35:58.801
and -- and -- and
the quota system will change.

35:58.836 --> 36:00.236
<i>I</i> will end it.

36:05.175 --> 36:08.411
Are you really gonna be
the next Chief of Police?
Yes, I am.

36:13.317 --> 36:16.786
And you're telling me that
you're gonna be against quotas?

36:18.322 --> 36:19.622
Give me that!

36:19.657 --> 36:21.291
Give me it!

36:21.325 --> 36:23.226
Give me it! Give me it!

36:23.260 --> 36:24.994
Give me!

36:25.029 --> 36:27.363
Oww!

36:42.980 --> 36:44.847
Holy cr-a-a-a-ap!

36:47.785 --> 36:49.619
Does someone want to give me
a hand with this, please?!

36:55.926 --> 36:57.360
What did you do?

36:58.729 --> 37:00.096
He's right.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.898
Sometimes violence
is the only way

37:01.932 --> 37:04.334
to teach people
how wrong they are.

37:04.368 --> 37:07.036
Amen.
Yeah, but on the day
before they announce

37:07.071 --> 37:08.705
who's gonna be
the next Chief of Police,

37:08.739 --> 37:10.273
you should have let <i>me</i>
<i>take the shot.</i>

37:10.307 --> 37:13.009
Can we get
a bomb tech here?!

37:13.043 --> 37:15.378
Maybe two!

37:15.412 --> 37:18.281
Or three! Or as many
as you want to bring.

37:18.315 --> 37:20.583
Hurry.

37:28.363 --> 37:30.397
In the scheme of things,
this isn't so important,

37:30.432 --> 37:32.299
but we inventoried
the evidence

37:32.333 --> 37:35.235
gathered at the parking
structure yesterday,

37:35.270 --> 37:38.739
and Mason's Manifesto
seems to be missing.

37:38.773 --> 37:40.340
Uh, well, I know

37:40.375 --> 37:42.309
in all the confusion
that led to Mason's death,

37:42.343 --> 37:43.911
um, I accidentally
dropped it,

37:43.945 --> 37:45.846
but I'm sure it'll turn up
eventually.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.582
Might be just as well
that it's missing.

37:48.616 --> 37:50.250
Otherwise
it'd be running 24/7,

37:50.285 --> 37:51.652
giving that maniac
credibility.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.353
No joke.
According to our guys,

37:53.388 --> 37:56.256
those tanks filled with Sarin could have killed
thousands of people.

37:57.959 --> 37:59.293
Yes, Commander?

37:59.327 --> 38:00.928
Excuse me, Chief.

38:00.962 --> 38:03.230
Uh, the Mayor
would like to see you.

38:10.572 --> 38:12.840
I-I'm sorry, Chief Johnson.

38:12.874 --> 38:18.178
It's Chief Delk
the Mayor requested.

38:32.293 --> 38:35.129
Nice.

38:38.867 --> 38:43.103
Yet another example,
as if we needed one...

38:43.138 --> 38:46.874
That life is not fair.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.514
Chief.

38:55.783 --> 38:57.584
Man.

38:57.619 --> 38:59.720
I like the way
that sounds --

38:59.754 --> 39:03.190
"Los Angeles Chief of Police
Thomas Delk."

39:06.327 --> 39:08.095
Well done.

39:13.835 --> 39:15.102
Are you all right?

39:15.136 --> 39:16.803
Yeah, I think so.

39:16.838 --> 39:18.972
You know,
if you hadn't shot that guy

39:19.007 --> 39:21.775
and you weren't facing
an F.I.D. investigation

39:21.809 --> 39:24.178
and a behavioral sciences
inquiry,

39:24.212 --> 39:25.946
the Mayor
might have appointed you.

39:25.980 --> 39:28.882
It wasn't worth the risk.

39:28.917 --> 39:31.451
Uh, do you mind if I have
a moment to myself?

39:31.486 --> 39:34.087
Sure.
Thanks.

40:10.024 --> 40:11.658
<i>As mayor of Los Angeles,</i>

40:11.693 --> 40:14.962
<i>i have made reform</i>
<i>the cornerstone of my agenda.</i>

40:14.996 --> 40:17.864
<i>And choosing from among</i>
<i>the many qualified candidates</i>

40:17.899 --> 40:19.866
<i>who have offered themselves</i>
<i>for this position,</i>

40:19.901 --> 40:21.969
<i>i was determined</i>
<i>to choose an individual</i>

40:22.003 --> 40:23.937
<i>who would carry forward</i>
<i>the momentum</i>

40:23.972 --> 40:26.940
<i>that outgoing police Chief</i>
<i>Thompson has established.</i>

40:26.975 --> 40:28.108
Here you go.

40:28.142 --> 40:29.509
<i>Choosing the leader</i>
<i>of L.A.P.D.'s</i>

40:29.544 --> 40:31.078
<i>Counterterrorism Bureau</i>

40:31.112 --> 40:32.779
<i>to be the next Chief of Police</i>

40:32.814 --> 40:36.016
<i>was a decision that,</i>
<i>quite frankly, made itself.</i>

40:36.050 --> 40:37.851
Thank you.
<i>And that's the truth.</i>

40:37.885 --> 40:39.052
You're welcome.

40:39.087 --> 40:40.520
<i>I can think of no better way</i>

40:40.555 --> 40:42.089
<i>to convey</i>
<i>this city's appreciation</i>

40:42.123 --> 40:45.692
<i>and no finer person</i>
<i>to choose for this job</i>

40:45.727 --> 40:48.729
<i>than Chief Thomas Delk.</i>

40:48.763 --> 40:50.330
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

40:50.365 --> 40:53.834
Well, the old bastard's out
and the new bastard's in.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.802
<i>Thank you, Mayor.</i>

40:55.837 --> 41:00.540
<i>I am honored, humbled,</i>
<i>and deeply grateful</i>

41:00.575 --> 41:01.875
<i>to be standing with you.</i>

41:01.909 --> 41:03.777
You'd think killing one
of the most wanted criminals

41:03.811 --> 41:05.646
in the country
would be a good thing.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.548
You would think, but you
don't get ahead in this
world by shooting dirtbags.

41:08.583 --> 41:10.651
Well, I, for one,
am glad she took the shot,

41:10.685 --> 41:13.053
although my ears
are still ringing.

41:13.087 --> 41:15.222
<i>...To continue that service...</i>

41:15.256 --> 41:16.857
You okay, Chief?

41:16.891 --> 41:20.827
Me? Well, maybe I'm
a little disappointed.

41:20.862 --> 41:22.262
<i>...No time to waste...</i>

41:22.297 --> 41:25.499
Maybe I'm a little relieved.
I never know.

41:25.533 --> 41:29.903
<i>And I'll be announcing the head</i>
<i>of that team in a few days.</i>

41:29.937 --> 41:32.806
Well, whatever else
happens...

41:32.840 --> 41:35.175
Yesterday
was a hell of a day.

41:35.209 --> 41:37.244
And, uh, if anybody
needs me after this,

41:37.278 --> 41:40.213
I'll be in my office
typing up my rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©.

41:41.115 --> 41:44.584
Do you think they're gonna
shut down Major Crimes?

41:44.619 --> 41:46.853
After what you guys
did for him yesterday?

41:46.888 --> 41:48.822
Well, we'll have to see,
won't we?

41:48.856 --> 41:51.858
<i>...Strengths and weaknesses</i>
<i>of our department</i>

41:51.893 --> 41:57.397
<i>and make the changes necessary</i>
<i>to this vital agency.</i>
