From Vegas with tricks,

00:51.552 --> 00:52.518

00:52.520 --> 00:53.419
which sounds like a low-budget
bond movie, doesn't it?

00:53.421 --> 00:56.655
Bond movie, doesn't it?
Please welcome penn and teller.

In the u.K.
We didn't know it would

01:25.686 --> 01:26.552

>> They might sound like
an anagram,

02:47.201 --> 02:47.900
an anagram,
but they are, in fact,

02:47.902 --> 02:49.735
but they are, in fact,
Sweden's finest magic act.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.770
Sweden's finest magic act.
Please welcome brynolf

02:51.772 --> 02:56.175

And this is Peter.
>> It's time for the world's

03:01.215 --> 03:02.881
>> it's time for the world's
most difficult card trick,

03:02.883 --> 03:04.850
most difficult card trick,
and some of you might wonder,

03:04.852 --> 03:05.551
and some of you might wonder,
"what makes this

03:05.553 --> 03:07.252
"what makes this
trick the world's most

03:07.254 --> 03:09.321
trick the world's most
difficult card trick?"

03:09.323 --> 03:10.455
Difficult card trick?"
>> And a simple,

03:10.457 --> 03:12.858
>> and a simple,
but yet brilliant answer

03:12.860 --> 03:15.761
but yet brilliant answer
is duct tape.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.763
Is duct tape.
By taping Peter's head,

03:22.669 --> 03:26.672
thereby blocking most
of Peter's senses,

03:26.674 --> 03:27.873
of Peter's senses,
we make it almost impossible

03:27.875 --> 03:28.540
we make it almost impossible
for him

03:28.542 --> 03:30.309
for him
to find the card that you, Mr.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.910
To find the card that you, Mr.
teller, will select in a moment.

03:31.912 --> 03:32.945
Teller, will select in a moment.
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:32.947 --> 03:34.947
ladies and gentlemen,
this is entertainment.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.490
I brought a deck of cards,
and I would like you

03:45.492 --> 03:45.991
and I would like you
to select one,

03:45.993 --> 03:47.459
to select one,
preferably a red because

03:47.461 --> 03:49.461
preferably a red because
we're gonna write on it,

03:52.498 --> 03:56.835
and I brought a pen as well.
Please write your signature

03:56.837 --> 04:01.273
please write your signature
across the face of the card.

04:01.275 --> 04:01.940
Across the face of the card.
You know, in Sweden,

04:01.942 --> 04:02.608
you know, in Sweden,
I could probably

04:02.610 --> 04:03.375
I could probably
trade that autograph

04:03.377 --> 04:05.377
trade that autograph
for a farm.

04:07.547 --> 04:13.252
Put it back.
Now, because of the signature,

04:13.254 --> 04:14.953
now, because of the signature,
this card is unique.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.421
This card is unique.
There's only one card

04:16.423 --> 04:17.522
there's only one card
in the world right now

04:17.524 --> 04:19.925
in the world right now
that looks exactly like this.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.293
That looks exactly like this.
I need a number as well, a

04:21.295 --> 04:24.830
I need a number as well, a
number between 5 and 15.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.731
Number between 5 and 15.
>> 11.

04:25.733 --> 04:26.398
>> 11.
>> 11.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.066
>> 11.
That's a great number.

04:27.067 --> 04:27.733
That's a great number.
>> Thank you.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.768
>> Thank you.
>> Okay, Peter,

04:29.770 --> 04:32.771
>> okay, Peter,
today's number is 11, okay?

04:34.907 --> 04:39.278
Are you ready, Peter?
Let's go.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.712
Let's go.
Now, despite all the tape

04:40.714 --> 04:41.947
now, despite all the tape
covering Peter's head,

04:41.949 --> 04:43.849
covering Peter's head,
he will use his amazing

04:43.851 --> 04:44.850
he will use his amazing
sleight of hand abilities

04:44.852 --> 04:46.351
sleight of hand abilities
to locate your card,

04:46.353 --> 04:47.586
to locate your card,
shuffle it around a bit,

04:47.588 --> 04:48.620
shuffle it around a bit,
and place it on the 11th

04:48.622 --> 04:50.622
and place it on the 11th
position counting from the top.

04:53.960 --> 04:58.897
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

04:58.899 --> 04:59.965
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.867
Eleven.
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:01.869 --> 05:02.968
ladies and gentlemen,
the world's most

05:02.970 --> 05:04.970
the world's most
difficult card trick.

05:07.907 --> 05:11.076
Now, because the world's most
difficult card trick, so we--

05:11.078 --> 05:12.411
difficult card trick, so we--
you can't succeed it once.

05:12.413 --> 05:12.878
You can't succeed it once.
You have to--like,

05:12.880 --> 05:14.046
you have to--like,
we build suspense.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.014
We build suspense.
This is basically how we do it,

05:16.016 --> 05:17.316
this is basically how we do it,
so a new number between

05:17.318 --> 05:18.884
so a new number between
5 and 15.

05:18.886 --> 05:19.551
5 and 15.
>> Six.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.018
>> Six.
>> Six.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.320
>> Six.
That's a great number. Peter.

05:21.322 --> 05:21.987
That's a great number. Peter.
>> Thank you.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.854
>> Thank you.
>> You missed it slightly.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.957
>> You missed it slightly.
Okay, so six is the new number.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.827
Okay, so six is the new number.
Okay, go ahead, Peter.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.363
Okay, go ahead, Peter.
One, two, three, four,

05:31.365 --> 05:34.733
one, two, three, four,
five--approximately.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.035
Five--approximately.
Six. Whoo!

05:37.037 --> 05:37.903
Six. Whoo!
I don't have

05:37.905 --> 05:40.405
I don't have
a good feeling about this.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.106
A good feeling about this.
The world's most difficult card

05:41.108 --> 05:41.973
the world's most difficult card
trick.

05:41.975 --> 05:42.808
Trick.
We build suspense again

05:42.810 --> 05:43.475
we build suspense again
and again.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.110
And again.
[Chuckles]

05:45.112 --> 05:46.945
[Chuckles]
You know, now, it's written

05:46.947 --> 05:48.413
you know, now, it's written
if you would fail like this,

05:48.415 --> 05:49.514
if you would fail like this,
this would

05:49.516 --> 05:52.050
this would
be totally appropriate.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.685
Be totally appropriate.
Okay, so we need a new number

05:53.687 --> 05:54.953
okay, so we need a new number
would be, like, boring.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.022
Would be, like, boring.
That's improvised.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.790
That's improvised.
I mean, this is how we

05:58.792 --> 06:00.792
I mean, this is how we
do it all the time.

06:04.464 --> 06:07.532
A staple gun.
Okay, so here's the plan.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.034
Okay, so here's the plan.
I will spring the cards up

06:09.036 --> 06:09.701
I will spring the cards up
in the air,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.103
in the air,
Peter will fire one staple that

06:11.105 --> 06:12.571
Peter will fire one staple that
will hit your card so

06:12.573 --> 06:14.506
will hit your card so
it falls down center stage.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.107
It falls down center stage.
Ladies and gentlemen, the

06:15.109 --> 06:15.974
ladies and gentlemen, the
world's most difficult

06:15.976 --> 06:16.908
world's most difficult
card trick.

06:16.910 --> 06:21.613
Card trick.
Are you ready? Are you ready?

06:21.615 --> 06:23.415
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Let's go!

06:23.417 --> 06:24.416
Let's go!
Whoo!

06:24.418 --> 06:27.419
Whoo!
[Cheers and applause]

06:41.601 --> 06:42.968
Now here comes
the interesting part.

06:42.970 --> 06:47.873
The interesting part.
Keep your eyes on Peter.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.442
Keep your eyes on Peter.
A pair of scissors.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.979
A pair of scissors.
The first thing we did was

06:53.981 --> 06:54.746
the first thing we did was
to tape Peter's head.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.915
To tape Peter's head.
After that, you selected a card,

06:56.917 --> 06:58.750
after that, you selected a card,
which you signed, which

06:58.752 --> 06:59.751
which you signed, which
means that there's only one card

06:59.753 --> 07:00.419
means that there's only one card
in the world that

07:00.421 --> 07:01.086
in the world that
looks like that.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.989
Looks like that.
I think that Peter has something

07:03.991 --> 07:06.858
I think that Peter has something
in his mouth neatly folded

07:06.860 --> 07:09.027
in his mouth neatly folded
four times.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.061
Four times.
Now,

07:10.063 --> 07:12.831
now,
if this is really your card,

07:12.833 --> 07:15.867
if this is really your card,
then it's a pretty good trick.

07:15.869 --> 07:16.535
Then it's a pretty good trick.
Yes or no,

07:16.537 --> 07:20.906
yes or no,
is this teller's card?

07:20.908 --> 07:21.740
Is this teller's card?
>> Sure looks that way.

07:21.741 --> 07:22.573
>> Sure looks that way.
>> Yeah.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.577

Does the tape hurt around

07:44.598 --> 07:45.063
does the tape hurt around
your face?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.031
Your face?
Because there's still a big

07:46.033 --> 07:46.698

08:13.160 --> 08:14.626
better looking,
and lived in Sweden,

08:14.628 --> 08:16.228

this would be us.

08:16.230 --> 08:19.030
This would be us.
[Laughter]

08:23.536 --> 08:26.238

ever been shown in Sweden?

08:26.240 --> 08:27.839
Ever been shown in Sweden?
You've ever seen us work?

08:27.841 --> 08:28.507
You've ever seen us work?
>> Yes.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.510

In ways that you'll understand.

was something that we--

08:39.052 --> 08:41.086
was something that we--
a very nice version

08:41.087 --> 08:42.020
a very nice version
of something we did

08:42.022 --> 08:43.255
of something we did
a couple of times

08:43.256 --> 08:45.156
a couple of times
on the David letterman show,

08:45.158 --> 08:46.591
on the David letterman show,
and the final thing

08:46.593 --> 08:48.827
and the final thing
you did at the end we once did

08:48.829 --> 08:51.162

and switching thing,

08:52.199 --> 08:54.099
and switching thing,
which I bet you didn't see,

08:54.101 --> 08:56.134
which I bet you didn't see,
but I said the important word,

08:56.136 --> 08:57.903
but I said the important word,
which is a switch there.

08:57.905 --> 09:01.106
Which is a switch there.
I will just say maybe this

09:01.108 --> 09:02.140
I will just say maybe this
will give you enough because

09:02.142 --> 09:03.008
will give you enough because
I love this act so much...

09:03.010 --> 09:03.975
I love this act so much...
>> Yeah.

09:03.977 --> 09:04.776
>> Yeah.
>> That I really don't want

09:04.778 --> 09:05.644
>> that I really don't want
to tip you because you

09:05.646 --> 09:06.611
to tip you because you
should be doing this forever.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.547
Should be doing this forever.
>> So you're kind of feeling

09:08.549 --> 09:09.281
>> so you're kind of feeling
quite comfortable now,

09:09.283 --> 09:10.148

who was looking so happy

09:33.273 --> 09:35.073
who was looking so happy
and pleased with himself

09:35.075 --> 09:36.741
and pleased with himself
just 30 seconds ago--

09:36.743 --> 09:37.275
just 30 seconds ago--
did you see that?

09:37.277 --> 09:38.143
Did you see that?
They were sitting back

09:38.145 --> 09:38.810
they were sitting back
in the chair.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.978
In the chair.
"We did that on this,

09:39.980 --> 09:40.912
"we did that on this,
we did that on this.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.781
We did that on this.
Well, I did this on that.

09:42.783 --> 09:43.815
Well, I did this on that.
Did you see this?"

09:43.817 --> 09:44.849
Did you see this?"
But they didn't, did they?

09:44.851 --> 09:45.317
But they didn't, did they?
>> No, they didn't.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.184
>> No, they didn't.
>> So let's hear

09:46.186 --> 09:47.319
>> so let's hear
what penn has to say now.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.621
What penn has to say now.
>> I'm even happier now

09:49.623 --> 09:51.323
>> I'm even happier now
than I was before because we

09:51.325 --> 09:52.891

10:06.607 --> 10:10.141
they're two young men heading
out with a spring in their step.

10:10.143 --> 10:13.244
Out with a spring in their step.
I enjoyed that so much

10:13.246 --> 10:14.212
I enjoyed that so much
because I knew--

10:14.214 --> 10:15.347
because I knew--
"I think he's gonna say,

10:15.349 --> 10:16.648
"I think he's gonna say,
'switch', he's gonna, say,

10:16.650 --> 10:17.682
'switch', he's gonna, say,
'switch', and he said,

10:17.684 --> 10:19.250
'switch', and he said,
'a switch.'"

10:19.252 --> 10:20.118
'a switch.'"
All right,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.152

it's time our first break,

10:21.154 --> 10:22.120
it's time our first break,
but make sure you come back,

10:22.122 --> 10:23.288
but make sure you come back,
as we've got plenty more foolers

10:23.290 --> 10:24.656
as we've got plenty more foolers
ready to take on Mr. penn

10:24.658 --> 10:25.790
ready to take on Mr. penn
and Mr. teller, and good luck

10:25.792 --> 10:26.257

fooling penn and teller.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.281
Fooling penn and teller.
So let's meet

10:50.283 --> 10:51.950
so let's meet
our next contender.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.184
Our next contender.
>> Colin mcleod.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.819
>> Colin mcleod.
>> My name is Colin mcleod.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.756
>> My name is Colin mcleod.
I am a mentalist from Scotland.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.763
You know, a number of newspapers
have referred to me as being the

11:04.765 --> 11:05.697
have referred to me as being the
Sherlock Holmes of the mind.

11:05.699 --> 11:06.364
Sherlock Holmes of the mind.
I mean,

11:06.366 --> 11:07.232
I mean,
I think the real interest

11:07.234 --> 11:08.299
I think the real interest
in Sherlock Holmes came

11:08.301 --> 11:10.035
in Sherlock Holmes came
from childhood,

11:10.037 --> 11:11.169
from childhood,
really, of getting the books

11:11.171 --> 11:12.203
really, of getting the books
and reading them and just being

11:12.205 --> 11:13.905
and reading them and just being
fascinated with this guy

11:13.907 --> 11:14.806
fascinated with this guy
who could look someone up

11:14.808 --> 11:15.273
who could look someone up
and down,

11:15.275 --> 11:17.208
and down,
and just from their appearance,

11:17.210 --> 11:18.276
and just from their appearance,
know essentially everything

11:18.278 --> 11:20.211
know essentially everything
about them.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.112
About them.
I actually studied

11:21.114 --> 11:22.414
I actually studied
forensic investigation

11:22.416 --> 11:24.282
forensic investigation
at university in Glasgow,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.351
at university in Glasgow,
but I specialize more

11:26.353 --> 11:27.852
but I specialize more
in criminal profiling.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.220
In criminal profiling.
I'm now taking that real

11:29.222 --> 11:31.056
I'm now taking that real
psychology and applying that

11:31.058 --> 11:32.724
psychology and applying that
to the entertainment aspect.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.391
To the entertainment aspect.
I really feel that I

11:33.393 --> 11:34.359
I really feel that I
can bring both together

11:34.361 --> 11:36.361
can bring both together
to create something quite unique

11:36.363 --> 11:38.029
to create something quite unique
and different,

11:38.031 --> 11:38.997
and different,
and the routine that I'm

11:38.998 --> 11:39.964
and the routine that I'm
gonna perform this evening

11:39.966 --> 11:40.899
gonna perform this evening
is to hopefully

11:40.901 --> 11:43.234
is to hopefully
give the audience the experience

11:43.236 --> 11:44.269
give the audience the experience
of being the closest thing

11:44.271 --> 11:45.904
of being the closest thing
to real mind reading that

11:45.906 --> 11:47.906
to real mind reading that
they'll ever see.

11:49.241 --> 11:52.110
>> Let me just
explain something here.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.246
Explain something here.
He claims that he can read

11:55.248 --> 11:57.182
he claims that he can read
our audience's minds, okay?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.049
Our audience's minds, okay?
And looking at you,

11:58.051 --> 11:59.217
and looking at you,
I don't want to be rude,

11:59.219 --> 11:59.951

a magazine along because it

12:00.921 --> 12:02.821
a magazine along because it
ain't gonna take long, is it?

12:02.823 --> 12:03.855
Ain't gonna take long, is it?
Will you please welcome

12:03.857 --> 12:05.857
will you please welcome
Mr. Colin mcleod?

12:14.133 --> 12:16.768
>> Hi. Good evening.
Thank you very much.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.236
Thank you very much.
All right, before I start,

12:18.238 --> 12:19.270
all right, before I start,
I think it's only right

12:19.272 --> 12:20.588
I think it's only right
that I tell you there are

12:20.589 --> 12:21.905
that I tell you there are
three techniques that I'm using

12:21.908 --> 12:23.241
three techniques that I'm using
to create the illusion I'm gonna

12:23.243 --> 12:24.209
to create the illusion I'm gonna
do tonight.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.344
Do tonight.
First of all, I'm not from here.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.345
First of all, I'm not from here.
I'm from a place

12:27.347 --> 12:28.813
I'm from a place
in Scotland called harthill.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.148
In Scotland called harthill.
It's very boring. There's cows.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.349
It's very boring. There's cows.
>> Whoo!

12:31.351 --> 12:33.418
>> Whoo!
>> Thank you.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.487
>> Thank you.
Not even my family.

12:35.489 --> 12:36.521
Not even my family.
But there are lots of cows,

12:36.523 --> 12:37.388
but there are lots of cows,
and they poo a lot.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.490
And they poo a lot.
So I left there very quickly.

12:38.492 --> 12:39.924
So I left there very quickly.
I went to whitburn academy,

12:39.926 --> 12:40.391
I went to whitburn academy,
where I started

12:40.393 --> 12:42.093
where I started
learning stage hypnosis.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.328
Learning stage hypnosis.
Then I went to university

12:43.330 --> 12:44.062
then I went to university
in Glasgow where

12:44.064 --> 12:45.096
in Glasgow where
I studied profiling.

12:45.098 --> 12:45.864
I studied profiling.
So basically,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.332
so basically,
the three skills I'm using

12:47.334 --> 12:49.000
the three skills I'm using
are psychology, suggestion,

12:49.002 --> 12:50.468
are psychology, suggestion,
and bull[Bleep], and it really

12:50.470 --> 12:52.403
and bull[Bleep], and it really
is a mixture of them that

12:52.405 --> 12:53.304
is a mixture of them that
you're about to witness.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.506
You're about to witness.
In fact, tonight,

12:54.508 --> 12:55.340
in fact, tonight,
for this demonstration,

12:55.342 --> 12:56.441
for this demonstration,
there's two things that you need

12:56.443 --> 12:57.442
there's two things that you need
to know, are very important.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.376
To know, are very important.
First of all,

12:58.378 --> 12:59.344
first of all,
we're gonna choose someone

12:59.346 --> 13:00.812
we're gonna choose someone
at random by throwing out a hat.

13:00.814 --> 13:01.880
At random by throwing out a hat.
We'll come to that in a second.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.149
We'll come to that in a second.
But secondly, this envelope.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.316
But secondly, this envelope.
This envelope is crucial

13:05.318 --> 13:09.087
this envelope is crucial
to what's about to take place.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.421
To what's about to take place.
Actually, penn,

13:10.423 --> 13:11.523
actually, penn,
instead of me choosing someone

13:11.525 --> 13:12.390
instead of me choosing someone
with a hat, to make it

13:12.392 --> 13:13.825
with a hat, to make it
even fairer, would you please

13:13.827 --> 13:15.527
even fairer, would you please
mind choosing someone that

13:15.529 --> 13:16.528
mind choosing someone that
you think this would work

13:16.530 --> 13:17.962
you think this would work
quite well with?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.330
Quite well with?
>> Okay, let me see

13:19.332 --> 13:20.431
>> okay, let me see
who I can get.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.033
Who I can get.
Well,

13:22.035 --> 13:24.402
well,
how about the gentleman here

13:24.404 --> 13:25.804
how about the gentleman here
in the kind of white shirt

13:25.806 --> 13:27.272
in the kind of white shirt
and the baseball hat?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.106
And the baseball hat?
He's right there in the front.

13:28.108 --> 13:28.573
He's right there in the front.
>> Hi,

13:28.575 --> 13:29.440
>> hi,
and what's your name, sir?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.308

For me, Kenny.
Kenny, can I just have you face

13:45.058 --> 13:45.890
Kenny, can I just have you face
the front just slightly more?

13:45.892 --> 13:46.925
The front just slightly more?
Kenny, be honest.

13:46.927 --> 13:47.392
Kenny, be honest.
Would you say that

13:47.394 --> 13:49.561

you have a good imagination?

13:49.563 --> 13:50.895
You have a good imagination?
>> Yeah. Yeah, pretty good.

13:50.897 --> 13:51.596
>> Yeah. Yeah, pretty good.
>> Okay, you thought about that,

13:51.598 --> 13:53.498
>> okay, you thought about that,
but that's okay, okay.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.866
But that's okay, okay.
Kenny, let's imagine--you see

13:54.868 --> 13:55.533
Kenny, let's imagine--you see
behind us we have bookcases.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.401
Behind us we have bookcases.
I want you

13:56.403 --> 13:57.402
I want you
to imagine for me, Kenny,

13:57.404 --> 13:58.536

that you walk into a bookshop,

13:58.538 --> 13:59.604
that you walk into a bookshop,
you open up the doors,

13:59.606 --> 14:00.538
you open up the doors,
and there's books

14:00.540 --> 14:01.439
and there's books
on either side of the bookshop.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.373
On either side of the bookshop.
Now, be honest, would

14:02.375 --> 14:03.441
now, be honest, would
you pick a book up from this

14:03.443 --> 14:04.542
you pick a book up from this
side or from over--where would

14:04.544 --> 14:06.544
side or from over--where would
you pick the book from?

14:06.546 --> 14:07.212
You pick the book from?
>> This side.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.413
>> This side.
>> Okay, you pick up the book,

14:08.415 --> 14:09.113
>> okay, you pick up the book,
you look at it.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.148
You look at it.
Now, you're gonna have

14:10.150 --> 14:11.049
now, you're gonna have
to imagine this.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.150
To imagine this.
Just look there,

14:12.152 --> 14:14.219
just look there,
tell us what's the book called?

14:14.221 --> 14:16.487
Tell us what's the book called?
Make it up.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.556
Make it up.

a good imagination.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.996
A good imagination.
Let us imagine you

14:24.998 --> 14:25.530
let us imagine you
flip through the book,

14:25.532 --> 14:26.965
flip through the book,
and you stop on one page.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.366
And you stop on one page.
Look there, tell us what page

14:28.368 --> 14:30.001

number do you actually stop on?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.236
Number do you actually stop on?
Just look right there.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.103
Just look right there.
It's up to you.

14:32.105 --> 14:32.570
It's up to you.
>> 18.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.438
>> 18.
>> Do you want

14:33.440 --> 14:34.138
>> do you want
to change your mind?

14:34.140 --> 14:35.039
To change your mind?
Are you happy with 18?

14:35.041 --> 14:35.773
Are you happy with 18?
>> I'm happy with 18.

14:35.774 --> 14:36.506

>> okay, I want you to look
there right now and just think

14:37.510 --> 14:38.543
there right now and just think
of one word that you can see.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.227
Of one word that you can see.
You can change your mind,

14:39.228 --> 14:39.910
you can change your mind,
if you like,

14:39.913 --> 14:41.145
if you like,
but get one word in your head.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.547
But get one word in your head.
Tell me when you've got one.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.414
Tell me when you've got one.
Don't say it, but just--

14:43.416 --> 14:44.082
don't say it, but just--
>> okay.

14:44.084 --> 14:44.749
>> Okay.
>> You got a word in mind?

>> You got a word in mind?
>> Yeah.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.128
>> Yeah.
>> You shut the book, then it

14:46.129 --> 14:46.839

goes back up on the shelf,
the book is gone.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.586
The book is gone.
Now, Kenny,

14:48.588 --> 14:50.488
now, Kenny,
I'm not gonna read your mind.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.356
I'm not gonna read your mind.
They are.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.523
They are.
The only clue that

14:52.525 --> 14:53.474

I want you to give them,

14:53.475 --> 14:54.424

14:55.495 --> 14:57.262

of letters in this word?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.163
Of letters in this word?
Is it quite a long word?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.498
Is it quite a long word?
Is it more than six letters?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.165
Is it more than six letters?
>> No.

of paper that I've got here.

15:09.264 --> 15:09.952
Of paper that I've got here.
Can you just look the other way

15:09.953 --> 15:10.641

for me...

15:10.644 --> 15:11.509
For me...

Right now is thinking of.

Eyes closed, as well, for me.
That would be lovely.

and change your mind?

though, wouldn't it?

15:45.512 --> 15:46.461
Though, wouldn't it?

Sorry. One more thing.
The reason I did ask penn

the reason I did ask penn
to choose someone this evening

16:03.997 --> 16:04.662
to choose someone this evening
is I didn't want to

16:04.664 --> 16:06.064
is I didn't want to
actually just throw out the hat.

16:06.066 --> 16:06.531
Actually just throw out the hat.
I tend

16:06.533 --> 16:07.632
I tend
to find it's quite painful,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.734
to find it's quite painful,
especially

16:09.736 --> 16:11.069
especially
when you're thinking of a brick.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.637
When you're thinking of a brick.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.640

Awesome. Great stuff.
I'm sure you're

16:26.119 --> 16:27.018
I'm sure you're
wanting us to think that you

16:27.020 --> 16:27.685
wanting us to think that you
had gone the wrong way,

16:27.687 --> 16:28.619
had gone the wrong way,
and you'd made a mistake

16:28.621 --> 16:29.320
and you'd made a mistake
in their head there.

16:29.322 --> 16:29.988
In their head there.
I'm not quite sure how

16:29.989 --> 16:30.655
I'm not quite sure how
you do it,

16:30.657 --> 16:31.556
you do it,
but let's just check something,

16:31.558 --> 16:32.357
but let's just check something,
and make sure everyone knows

16:32.359 --> 16:33.124
and make sure everyone knows
you didn't know Kenny,

16:33.126 --> 16:34.525
you didn't know Kenny,
you hadn't met Kenny?

16:34.527 --> 16:35.593
You hadn't met Kenny?
>> Never met Kenny before

16:35.595 --> 16:36.461
>> never met Kenny before
in my life,

16:36.463 --> 16:37.195
in my life,
but thank you, Kenny,

16:37.197 --> 16:37.662
but thank you, Kenny,
for helping.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.529
For helping.
>> Because he was

16:38.531 --> 16:39.364
>> because he was
chosen by random by penn,

16:39.366 --> 16:40.182
chosen by random by penn,
so there's no way you

16:40.183 --> 16:40.999
so there's no way you
could have influenced that.

16:41.001 --> 16:41.699
Could have influenced that.
I'm dying to ask you how

16:41.701 --> 16:42.567
I'm dying to ask you how
you did it.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.501
You did it.
I know you're not gonna tell me.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.168
I know you're not gonna tell me.
It might well be

16:44.170 --> 16:44.902
it might well be
you have a good chance.

16:44.903 --> 16:45.635
You have a good chance.
Do you feel confident?

16:45.638 --> 16:46.454
Do you feel confident?
Do you think you're gonna

16:46.455 --> 16:47.271
do you think you're gonna
be going to Vegas?

16:47.273 --> 16:48.272
Be going to Vegas?
>> You know, it's really not

16:48.274 --> 16:49.140
>> you know, it's really not
about me trying to fool them.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.508
About me trying to fool them.
As long as I entertained them

16:50.510 --> 16:51.676
as long as I entertained them
and entertained everyone here,

16:51.678 --> 16:52.510
and entertained everyone here,
that's really been

16:52.512 --> 16:53.277
that's really been
my goal tonight.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.612
My goal tonight.
>> Well, I think the answer is,

16:54.614 --> 16:55.646
>> well, I think the answer is,
you've certainly achieved

16:55.648 --> 17:00.585
you've certainly achieved
that because it was great.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.252
That because it was great.
They look ready.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.453
They look ready.
They look ready to talk.

17:02.454 --> 17:03.653
They look ready to talk.
Penn, over to you.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.690
Penn, over to you.
>> It was great,

17:05.692 --> 17:06.691
>> it was great,
and, you know, we have

17:06.693 --> 17:08.159
and, you know, we have
studied a bit of mentalism.

17:08.161 --> 17:08.626
Studied a bit of mentalism.
>> Yeah.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.493
>> Yeah.
>> So I'm telling you

17:09.496 --> 17:10.395
>> so I'm telling you
we were burning here

17:10.396 --> 17:11.695
we were burning here
from the moment, we were ready

17:11.698 --> 17:12.430
from the moment, we were ready
for all sorts

17:12.432 --> 17:14.499
for all sorts
of things you didn't use,

17:14.501 --> 17:15.500
of things you didn't use,
and you led us down

17:15.502 --> 17:17.068
and you led us down
a few garden paths,

17:17.069 --> 17:19.369
a few garden paths,
and I also think, once again,

17:19.372 --> 17:21.672
and I also think, once again,
you know, we don't like

17:21.674 --> 17:23.174
you know, we don't like
to ruin magic too much.

17:23.175 --> 17:23.641
To ruin magic too much.
>> Yeah.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.209
>> Yeah.
>> So I'm gonna ask

17:25.211 --> 17:26.676
>> so I'm gonna ask
the fella from the audience

17:26.679 --> 17:28.746
the fella from the audience
if your imagination,

17:28.748 --> 17:29.680
if your imagination,
when you were just

17:29.682 --> 17:32.050
when you were just
imagining this big library

17:32.052 --> 17:33.284
imagining this big library
of books, and you're

17:33.286 --> 17:35.353
of books, and you're
imagining opening up the book,

17:35.355 --> 17:37.488
imagining opening up the book,
and you were imagining looking

17:37.490 --> 17:38.389
and you were imagining looking
at the word,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.191
at the word,
and that word was being formed

17:40.193 --> 17:40.825
and that word was being formed
in your head,

17:40.827 --> 17:41.759
in your head,
and you were getting it

17:41.761 --> 17:44.629
and you were getting it
so clearly in your head,

17:44.631 --> 17:47.465
so clearly in your head,
was his pantomime so good that

17:47.467 --> 17:49.100
was his pantomime so good that
you felt it was helping you

17:49.102 --> 17:51.502
you felt it was helping you
with your imagination?

17:51.504 --> 17:52.403
With your imagination?
>> Yes.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.538
>> Yes.
>> Really good, wasn't it?

17:53.540 --> 17:54.205
>> Really good, wasn't it?
>> It was fantastic.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.440
>> It was fantastic.
>> It was great, and I would

17:55.441 --> 17:56.674
>> it was great, and I would
like to leave it at that.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.242
Like to leave it at that.
You did a wonderful job at

17:58.244 --> 18:00.812
you did a wonderful job at
pantomiming the book.

wasn't that incredible,

32:21.607 --> 32:22.406
wasn't that incredible,
ladies and gentlemen?

32:22.408 --> 32:23.273
Ladies and gentlemen?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.175
That really was.
I always get the feeling that

32:25.177 --> 32:25.776
I always get the feeling that
the people doing close-up

32:25.777 --> 32:26.376
the people doing close-up
stuff in front

32:26.378 --> 32:27.244
stuff in front
of penn and teller, that must be

32:27.246 --> 32:28.679
of penn and teller, that must be
the hardest because unlike us,

32:28.681 --> 32:29.680
the hardest because unlike us,
they know where to look.

32:29.682 --> 32:30.347
They know where to look.
>> Yeah.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.348
>> Yeah.
>> You know, they're looking

32:31.350 --> 32:32.249
>> you know, they're looking
because they've done this kind

32:32.251 --> 32:33.951
because they've done this kind
of thing themselves, perhaps.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.052
Of thing themselves, perhaps.
Did you catch teller or

32:35.054 --> 32:36.286
did you catch teller or
penn looking somewhere where

32:36.288 --> 32:37.220
penn looking somewhere where
normally someone wouldn't look?

32:37.222 --> 32:37.932
Normally someone wouldn't look?
>> Of course they do.

32:37.933 --> 32:38.643
>> Of course they do.
Of course they do--I mean,

32:38.644 --> 32:39.354
of course they do--I mean,
they're the true professionals,

32:39.358 --> 32:41.058
they're the true professionals,
so they look at something else.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.392
So they look at something else.
I was aware of that.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.460
I was aware of that.
There is a type of concept

32:43.462 --> 32:44.461
there is a type of concept
maybe they don't know.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.329
Maybe they don't know.
Maybe they do.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.263
Maybe they do.
>> I think they've had long

32:46.265 --> 32:47.130
>> I think they've had long
enough, ladies and gentlemen.

32:47.132 --> 32:47.915
Enough, ladies and gentlemen.

33:24.003 --> 33:24.668
>> Okay.
>> I'm just gonna tell

33:24.669 --> 33:25.334
>> I'm just gonna tell
you that we know two--

33:25.337 --> 33:26.003
you that we know two--
>> right.

33:26.005 --> 33:26.720
>> Right.
>> And we're gonna pick one,

33:26.721 --> 33:27.436
>> and we're gonna pick one,
and you could have

33:27.439 --> 33:28.372
and you could have
been using pencil reading.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.039
Been using pencil reading.
If you were

33:29.041 --> 33:30.474
if you were
using pencil reading,

33:30.476 --> 33:32.242
using pencil reading,
then I'm a really good one for

33:32.244 --> 33:34.311
then I'm a really good one for
that because I write really big.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.445
That because I write really big.
You told me to write

33:35.447 --> 33:36.747
you told me to write
big and write clear,

33:36.749 --> 33:38.215
big and write clear,
and you could have read

33:38.217 --> 33:39.049
and you could have read
the pencil,

33:39.051 --> 33:40.384
the pencil,
and then getting it turned over

33:40.386 --> 33:42.285
and then getting it turned over
in the deck after that

33:42.287 --> 33:43.086
in the deck after that
is pretty simple

33:43.088 --> 33:44.287
is pretty simple
with a stack, or--

33:44.289 --> 33:45.722
with a stack, or--
>> there's no stack at all.

33:45.724 --> 33:46.690
>> There's no stack at all.
No stack.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.358
No stack.
>> I'm gonna push you right now.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.626
>> I'm gonna push you right now.
You've got one chance

33:49.628 --> 33:51.294
you've got one chance
to tell me this other way,

33:51.296 --> 33:52.295
to tell me this other way,
unless you were making it up.

33:52.297 --> 33:53.030
Unless you were making it up.
They said they had two.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.297
They said they had two.
Maybe they only had one.

33:54.299 --> 33:55.032
Maybe they only had one.
Let's find out.

33:55.034 --> 33:55.499
Let's find out.
>> No, no.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.733
>> No, no.
I'm gonna tell you something

33:56.735 --> 33:58.402
I'm gonna tell you something
right now, Jonathan Ross.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.770
Right now, Jonathan Ross.
>> Yes, penn.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.238
>> Yes, penn.
>> The other one we had--

34:01.240 --> 34:01.705
>> the other one we had--
>> has disappeared.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.240
>> Has disappeared.
>> Was a stack,

34:03.242 --> 34:04.274
>> was a stack,
and he instantly said--

34:04.276 --> 34:05.275
and he instantly said--
>> it's not a stack. No stack.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.109
>> It's not a stack. No stack.
>> There was no stack.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.477
>> There was no stack.
>> So that means I need

34:07.479 --> 34:08.411
>> so that means I need
to hear it from you, penn.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.079
To hear it from you, penn.
>> No, no, no, no.

34:09.081 --> 34:10.179
>> No, no, no, no.
We have to go

34:10.181 --> 34:11.614
we have to go
with pencil reading,

34:11.617 --> 34:13.483
with pencil reading,
and if he says no honestly on...

34:13.485 --> 34:14.351
And if he says no honestly on...
>> It's not.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.152
>> It's not.
>> Pencil reading, then, sir,

34:16.155 --> 34:17.154
>> pencil reading, then, sir,
you are going

34:17.156 --> 34:19.156
you are going
to Las Vegas because, sir,

34:19.158 --> 34:22.092
to Las Vegas because, sir,
you fooled us.

34:22.094 --> 34:26.228
You fooled us.
>> He fooled them.

34:26.231 --> 34:26.763
>> He fooled them.
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:26.764 --> 34:27.630
ladies and gentlemen,
he's going to Vegas.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.632
He's going to Vegas.
Mr. etienne pradier.

34:34.338 --> 34:37.139
That was quite something,
wasn't it?

34:37.141 --> 34:38.408
Wasn't it?
After the break, penn and teller

34:38.409 --> 34:39.076
after the break, penn and teller
will perform

34:39.078 --> 34:40.110

34:40.112 --> 34:42.212
For the night right here.
I cannot wait. Don't go away.

34:56.561 --> 34:57.627
>> Okay, now, I said going
to the break that you

34:57.629 --> 34:59.429

won't believe this next trick,

34:59.431 --> 35:00.263
won't believe this next trick,
and there's nothing much more

35:00.265 --> 35:01.131
and there's nothing much more
to add.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.100
To add.
Will you please welcome

35:03.102 --> 35:06.603

35:19.118 --> 35:21.251
do magic tricks,
you've seen them do illusions,

35:21.253 --> 35:23.220
you've seen them do illusions,
but we do exclusively

35:23.222 --> 35:26.823
but we do exclusively
God-given miracles.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.259
God-given miracles.
Teller was blessed by God

35:29.261 --> 35:30.827
teller was blessed by God
with the ability to mend

35:30.829 --> 35:34.631

polyester with his mind.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.166
Polyester with his mind.
Now, you're all about to have

a disciple right up here

35:43.275 --> 35:44.508
a disciple right up here
onstage, someone

35:46.712 --> 35:48.879
who is not filled with dogma,
someone who does not yet belong

35:48.881 --> 35:50.247
someone who does not yet belong
to a church.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.682
To a church.
We are looking for a child.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.451
We are looking for a child.
Is there a real proper child

35:54.453 --> 35:55.785
is there a real proper child
in the audience, like, you know,

35:55.787 --> 35:57.387

Someone like that?
Yeah, don't force the child

36:00.225 --> 36:01.791
yeah, don't force the child
to put his hand up.

36:01.793 --> 36:05.428
To put his hand up.
We're not that church.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.430
We're not that church.
How about--

We have here perfectly

36:25.751 --> 36:27.884
we have here perfectly
ordinary polyester like some

36:27.886 --> 36:29.219
ordinary polyester like some
of you embarrassingly

of you embarrassingly
enough have on your own person.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.105
Enough have on your own person.
I want you to come over here.

36:32.106 --> 36:32.855
I want you to come over here.
What's your name?

36:32.858 --> 36:33.523
What's your name?
>> Brandon.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.391
>> Brandon.
>> Brandon.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.859
>> Brandon.
Now, Brandon, I've got here

36:35.861 --> 36:37.260
now, Brandon, I've got here
a pair of scissors,

36:37.262 --> 36:39.796
a pair of scissors,
and, Brandon, I say unto you,

36:39.798 --> 36:43.366
and, Brandon, I say unto you,
I tear the polyester asunder.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.301
I tear the polyester asunder.
Now, it's cut in two pieces

36:44.303 --> 36:45.302
now, it's cut in two pieces
of approximately equal size,

36:45.304 --> 36:45.769
of approximately equal size,
Brandon.

36:45.771 --> 36:46.503
Brandon.
Take one end of that,

36:46.504 --> 36:47.236
take one end of that,
would you, please?

36:47.239 --> 36:48.572
Would you, please?
And walk to the--hold on tight.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.573
And walk to the--hold on tight.
Don't let go no matter what,

36:49.575 --> 36:50.607
don't let go no matter what,
and walk to the other side

36:50.609 --> 36:51.608
and walk to the other side
of teller, about the same

36:51.610 --> 36:52.442
of teller, about the same
distance from teller

36:52.444 --> 36:53.743
distance from teller
as I am so that teller

36:53.745 --> 36:57.981
as I am so that teller
is right in the middle.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.916
Is right in the middle.
Perfect, Brandon.

36:59.918 --> 37:00.984
Perfect, Brandon.
Now, Brandon, you saw

37:00.986 --> 37:02.252
now, Brandon, you saw
that polyester cut, didn't you?

37:02.254 --> 37:02.719
That polyester cut, didn't you?
>> Yeah.

37:02.721 --> 37:03.753
>> Yeah.
>> You saw it cut.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.555
>> You saw it cut.
Now teller's gonna mend that

37:05.557 --> 37:10.393
now teller's gonna mend that
polyester using the secular

37:10.395 --> 37:13.330
polyester using the secular
humanist method of the knot.

37:13.332 --> 37:13.797
Humanist method of the knot.
Now, that's where

37:13.799 --> 37:14.798
now, that's where
you need objectiveness.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.865
You need objectiveness.
A materialist such as

37:15.867 --> 37:17.367
a materialist such as
myself would do it, but

37:17.369 --> 37:18.401
myself would do it, but
I want you to watch, Brandon,

37:18.403 --> 37:19.436
I want you to watch, Brandon,
as teller goes a step further.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.403
As teller goes a step further.
Teller is snipping

37:20.405 --> 37:22.339
teller is snipping
off the bunny ears.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.006
Off the bunny ears.
Now, Brandon,

37:23.008 --> 37:25.742
now, Brandon,
that change is merely cosmetic.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.943
That change is merely cosmetic.
There is still a knot there

37:26.945 --> 37:28.378
there is still a knot there
making a mockery of all that

37:28.380 --> 37:29.946
making a mockery of all that
is held holy in the world,

37:29.948 --> 37:30.714
is held holy in the world,
but you watch

37:30.716 --> 37:32.349
but you watch
as teller's therapeutic touch

37:32.351 --> 37:34.718
as teller's therapeutic touch
just melts that knot right away.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.587
Just melts that knot right away.
Can someone say, "amen"?

37:37.589 --> 37:40.757
Can someone say, "amen"?
Go ahead. Say it! Hallelujah!

37:40.759 --> 37:43.326
Go ahead. Say it! Hallelujah!
Can I get a witness?

37:47.698 --> 37:50.267
Now, Brandon, since
you are right up here

37:50.269 --> 37:51.901
you are right up here
onstage breathing down

37:51.903 --> 37:53.336
onstage breathing down
the neck of the new messiah,

37:53.338 --> 37:55.038
the neck of the new messiah,
did that seem to you to be

37:55.040 --> 37:58.808
did that seem to you to be
a miracle or a magic trick?

37:58.810 --> 38:01.044
A miracle or a magic trick?
A miracle or a magic trick?

38:01.046 --> 38:01.978
A miracle or a magic trick?
>> A magic trick.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.546
>> A magic trick.
>> A magic trick.

38:03.548 --> 38:04.414
>> A magic trick.
Oh, too bad.

38:04.416 --> 38:04.914
Oh, too bad.
We picked

38:04.916 --> 38:06.416
we picked
a state school student.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.550
A state school student.
That's okay, Brandon.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.418
That's okay, Brandon.
You've got one end

38:08.420 --> 38:08.885
you've got one end
of the polyester,

38:08.887 --> 38:09.686
of the polyester,
I've got the other end.

38:09.687 --> 38:10.486
I've got the other end.
Stare at teller's hands,

38:10.489 --> 38:11.955
stare at teller's hands,
stare at his hands, burn them!

38:11.957 --> 38:13.056
Stare at his hands, burn them!
Burn them! Stare at them!

38:13.058 --> 38:14.424
Burn them! Stare at them!
Stare at them! Burn them!

38:14.426 --> 38:16.393
Stare at them! Burn them!
Don't be misdirected,

38:16.395 --> 38:17.694
don't be misdirected,
and explain that, you skeptical

38:17.696 --> 38:19.696
and explain that, you skeptical
little freak.

38:25.636 --> 38:29.873
What you're watching right now
is our newest friend Brandon

38:29.875 --> 38:31.408
is our newest friend Brandon
is having an epiphany up here

38:31.410 --> 38:32.409
is having an epiphany up here
onstage,

38:32.411 --> 38:33.610
onstage,
and he has decided to dedicate

38:33.612 --> 38:35.378
and he has decided to dedicate
his young life to preaching

38:35.380 --> 38:36.880
his young life to preaching
the gospel of teller.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.381
The gospel of teller.
But, Brandon, as you travel

38:38.383 --> 38:39.416
but, Brandon, as you travel
the world bringing

38:39.418 --> 38:41.318
the world bringing
this good news to modern man,

38:41.320 --> 38:43.086
this good news to modern man,
you will encounter some skeptics

38:43.088 --> 38:44.020
you will encounter some skeptics
with hardened hearts,

38:44.022 --> 38:45.055
with hardened hearts,
such as your own was,

38:45.057 --> 38:45.722
such as your own was,
and you'll have

38:45.724 --> 38:47.424
and you'll have
to demonstrate this to them.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.392
To demonstrate this to them.
So teller has now given you

38:49.394 --> 38:51.361
so teller has now given you
the power of the polyester.

38:51.363 --> 38:52.329
The power of the polyester.
You know what that means,

38:52.331 --> 38:52.896
you know what that means,
Brandon?

38:52.898 --> 38:53.596
Brandon?
>> No.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.899
>> No.
>> It means have dominion over

38:55.901 --> 38:57.334
>> it means have dominion over
all synthetic fabrics.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.435
All synthetic fabrics.
Brandon, walk to the center

38:58.437 --> 38:59.102
Brandon, walk to the center
of the polyester.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.537
Of the polyester.
Walk to the center, and

39:00.539 --> 39:01.638
walk to the center, and
just grab a hunk there, Brandon.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.772
Just grab a hunk there, Brandon.
Grab a hunk.

39:02.774 --> 39:03.940
Grab a hunk.
Just grab--now, Brandon,

39:05.811 --> 39:06.476
you found the center
of the polyester.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.344
Of the polyester.
Now, Brandon,

39:07.346 --> 39:08.511
now, Brandon,
you take the scissors, Brandon.

39:08.513 --> 39:08.978
You take the scissors, Brandon.
Take the scissors.

39:08.980 --> 39:09.646
Take the scissors.
>> Okay.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.513
>> Okay.
>> And you are going

39:10.515 --> 39:11.564
>> and you are going
to run with the scissors!

39:11.565 --> 39:12.614
To run with the scissors!
Run with the scissors!

39:12.617 --> 39:15.719
Run with the scissors!
No, no, no, just--just joking.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.987
No, no, no, just--just joking.
I was just testing your faith,

39:17.989 --> 39:19.723
I was just testing your faith,
Brandon, testing your faith.
