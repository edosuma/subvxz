WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:04.672
Oh, really?
(LAUGHING) Yes.

00:04.705 --> 00:05.939
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:05.973 --> 00:07.741
Oh, Clark,
good morning.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.177
You remember
the lovely Megan.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.478
Hello.
CLARK: Yes. Hi.
Good morning.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.246
Um, uh, Pat?

00:14.382 --> 00:16.084
Uh, are you feeling okay?

00:16.117 --> 00:17.485
You just...
You look a little...

00:17.518 --> 00:20.354
Damn! What the hell
is wrong with your face?

00:20.388 --> 00:21.655
That's scary.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.359
Damona, it's a
medical workplace.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.195
No matter what comes
through the door,

00:27.228 --> 00:29.263
we need to react
professionally.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.898
Damn!

00:32.866 --> 00:34.302
What the hell is wrong
with your face?

00:34.335 --> 00:36.204
That's scary.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.772
I'm sure it's nothing.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.709
Yeah, it's just a
basic irritant

00:41.742 --> 00:43.444
who happens to have a rash.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.446
(LAUGHING)

00:46.780 --> 00:48.849
Well, fortunately,
love is blind.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.950
Isn't that right,
Megan?

00:49.983 --> 00:52.353
(LAUGHING)
No, not at all.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.390
Isn't it great
our relationship has
gotten to the point

00:56.424 --> 00:58.792
where she can be comfortable
being so honest with me?

00:58.826 --> 00:59.860
Yeah.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.163
Anyway, you better clear up
that situation

01:02.196 --> 01:03.431
before the banquet
tomorrow night,

01:03.464 --> 01:05.533
or Megan is not
going to be happy.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.800
Oh. (LAUGHS)

01:06.834 --> 01:09.403
Yeah, we're going to this big
pharmaceuticals banquet.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.140
And I can't have Blotches here
making me look bad.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.309
Aww, you see how
she cares for me.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.610
She doesn't want me
to feel bad

01:16.644 --> 01:17.778
about embarrassing her

01:17.811 --> 01:20.281
with the horror
that is my face.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.917
You know, you should really
get that looked at.

01:23.951 --> 01:26.287
Whatever you have to do,
Patrice.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.421
(MOUTHING) Patrice?

01:27.455 --> 01:28.889
Well,
I better get going.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.791
These drugs
don't sell themselves.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.260
All right, all right.
(CHUCKLES)

01:32.293 --> 01:34.027
Tickle party!

01:34.061 --> 01:36.264
I'll walk you out, sweet...
Oh, she's already gone.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.835
Man, I know nuts
when I see it,

01:41.869 --> 01:44.805
and she is a whole
mixed bag of 'em.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.907
Nuts!

01:54.282 --> 01:56.217
Hey, wellness alert!

01:56.250 --> 01:58.386
Yeah, I've got half-off fliers
to the alcove,

01:58.419 --> 01:59.753
that new meditation center.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.556
Oh, right,
the place down the street.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.226
The one that replaced
that delicious Jamaican spot.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.795
Sorry. I'm hungry.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.397
Anyway, I'm thinking of trying
it before work tomorrow.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.365
You want to come?
Sure. Why not?

02:11.399 --> 02:12.833
I tried to meditate
on my own,

02:12.866 --> 02:14.702
but every time I find
a moment of peace,

02:14.735 --> 02:15.936
I'm inevitably interrupted.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.207
Ooh, Ally lama.
(LAUGHS)

02:19.240 --> 02:21.675
Gonna get your Zen on.
(LAUGHS)

02:21.709 --> 02:24.712
Hey, you know, why don't
I join you fools, huh?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.914
You know, when all that
silence gets awkward,

02:26.947 --> 02:29.883
I can be there to say,
"awkward!"

02:29.917 --> 02:33.487
Oh, uh, I don't know how many
half-off fliers Clark got,

02:33.521 --> 02:35.423
so...
Oh, I get it.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.492
I know your "I want to say no,
but I don't know how" tone.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.529
Oh, right.
From our wedding.

02:41.562 --> 02:44.064
You better stop making
that joke, Allison!

02:50.137 --> 02:52.740
Has my rash
gotten worse?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.175
You know, as a nurse,
I would say yes.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.278
As just someone who knows you,
I would say,

02:57.311 --> 03:00.681
"Oh, sweet mother of God."

03:00.714 --> 03:02.916
All right, Ken, you're gonna
have to give me an exam.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.353
It looks like
you actually have hives.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.521
Well, I... I'm not sure
I should be the one
examining you

03:07.555 --> 03:11.259
since we're co-workers
and frien... Co-workers.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.093
What about Tuttle?
Oh, no, no.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.428
Tuttle is our most
talented doctor.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.230
I can't waste
his time with this.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.099
Uh, thank you?

03:19.132 --> 03:21.168
Yeah. Tell you what,
I'll go gown up.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.937
Hey, you've never
seen me naked before.
This will be fun.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.282
What's up with
Dave's girlfriend?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.183
She never talks.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.986
Dave prefers to think of her
as "deliberate"
and "unwavering."

03:39.019 --> 03:41.255
I prefer to think of her
as weird.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.059
Okay,
so no backgammon.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.197
What about cards?
I bet you like Go Fish.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.369
We could bake cookies.

03:55.403 --> 03:58.739
There's this
chai snickerdoodle recipe
I've been dying to try.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.412
Hey, how about
your new puzzle, Dave?

04:04.445 --> 04:05.646
What do you think,
Emily?

04:05.679 --> 04:08.449
Want to give
"dozens of dalmatians" a try?

04:13.587 --> 04:16.557
Okay.
From one puzzle to another.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.126
*

04:21.128 --> 04:22.796
All right.
Well, it's definitely hives,

04:22.830 --> 04:24.598
and it's more prominent
than this morning.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.967
Yeah, and the itching
is unbearable.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.903
Pat, I hope this isn't
uncomfortable for you,

04:29.937 --> 04:33.006
but I'm gonna have
to look at every...
Oh, right.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.778
Uh, not presenting
anywhere else.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.180
Thank you.
You can close it.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.749
I'm good.
Please?

04:41.782 --> 04:42.916
All right.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.019
When did this
start happening?

04:46.053 --> 04:48.522
Well, off and on
over the past few weeks.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.291
Ever have any similar
reactions to shellfish?

04:51.325 --> 04:52.493
Peanuts?
Any wheezing?

04:52.526 --> 04:53.927
No.
(CELLPHONE VIBRATES)

04:56.330 --> 04:58.198
Oh, it's Megan.
I'm gonna have to
take this.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.802
Hello, milady.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.203
Ah, yeah.
We're taking care of it.

05:03.236 --> 05:06.374
Yeah, Welltopia's fifth-best
doctor is on the case.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.644
All right, I'll keep you po...
Oh, she already hung up.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.847
Did you just call me
Welltopia's fifth-best doctor?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.716
Yeah.
Sorry. Did I miscount?

05:15.749 --> 05:18.118
I mean, there's, uh...

05:18.151 --> 05:20.220
Oh, no, that's right.
You're the sixth.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.357
Okay, Pat, I'm gonna give you
some Benadryl,

05:23.391 --> 05:25.258
but first you need to see
an allergist

05:25.292 --> 05:26.994
to determine
what's causing these hives.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.030
So I'm sending you upstairs
for skin testing
with Dr. Jenkins.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.132
Oh, I forgot Jenkins.
That makes you seventh.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.034
*

05:36.970 --> 05:40.107
Hey, any interest in
Jamaican takeout for dinner?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.310
You're pacing.
What's wrong?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.879
It's Pat
and this whole rash thing.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.581
It's also your erratic
food choices,

05:47.615 --> 05:49.917
but mostly the rash thing.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.318
I just got off the phone
with the allergist.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.020
All his tests came back
negative.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.722
I don't know
what's causing his hives.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.823
Huh.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.825
Could be stress urticaria.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.393
Any unusual stressors
in his life?

05:59.427 --> 06:01.495
Uh, I don't know.
Let's see.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.630
(LAUGHS)

06:02.663 --> 06:04.932
He went through
that crazy divorce.

06:04.965 --> 06:09.069
He lived on a boat
in a driveway.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.971
He even slept in the clinic
for a while.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.641
He was fully committed
to the hobo lifestyle.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.775
Respect.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.711
But these are more recent.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.914
I'm thinking Pat
may be allergic to nuts.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.950
Well, the testing
ruled out nuts.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.486
(CHUCKLES) No, I mean
that nut, Megan, he's dating.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.754
(LAUGHS)

06:28.388 --> 06:31.324
Zing. Good one.
(LAUGHS)

06:31.358 --> 06:33.961
The hives did appear right
when they started dating.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.097
Yeah, you're right.
Megan is a nut.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.567
Oh, nut-meg.
Double zing. (LAUGHS)

06:39.600 --> 06:41.535
Aw, I feel awful.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.472
I have to tell the
loneliest man on earth

06:44.505 --> 06:48.642
that he's allergic
to the one woman
who will have him?

06:48.676 --> 06:51.011
Maybe spend
five more minutes
on the phrasing.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.080
But he's so into her.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.015
(SCOFFS) look,
I know he really likes her.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.718
But some relationships
aren't healthy,

06:57.751 --> 06:59.453
and it's important
for him to recognize

06:59.487 --> 07:01.822
that she's just
not good for him.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.192
Yeah, ideally,
before his face falls off.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.360
(BOTH LAUGHING)

07:16.737 --> 07:18.839
Molly, I'm experiencing
some emotions,

07:18.872 --> 07:21.041
which I'm not sure
how to process.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.276
It's just boredom,
not actual hunger.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.013
No, I'm not hungry.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.983
Well, that's not true, but...
This is about Emily.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.451
I'm thinking of
breaking up with her.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.587
Really?

07:33.621 --> 07:36.724
I was starting to suspect
we're not as compatible
as I thought,

07:36.757 --> 07:38.492
and overhearing
Mom and Dad talk about it

07:38.526 --> 07:40.393
really drove the point home.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.595
What did they say?

07:41.629 --> 07:43.697
Mom called our relationship
unhealthy.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.999
Oh, and Dad thinks
it could make
my face fall off.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.003
But there was nothing
on WebMD to back him up.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.707
Sorry, Dave.
Breakups are hard.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.709
And this isn't
just any breakup.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.277
I'm the light of her life.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.480
Well, I'm sure
you'll find the right way
to do it.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.683
Do what?
Break up with Emily.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.184
I'll do it for you.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.888
Bless you, Grandpa.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.592
No. No one deserves,
"Dave doesn't like you
anymore! Go away!"

08:13.794 --> 08:16.564
Please, I would never beat
around the bush like that.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.702
No, no. Molly's right.
I should do this myself.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.936
Oy vey.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.038
This is not gonna be fun.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.709
Dave,
don't worry about it.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.945
Just think about how terrible
she's gonna feel.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.914
*

08:38.952 --> 08:40.153
Thanks for
coming with me.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.322
Are you kidding?
This is gonna be great.

08:42.355 --> 08:47.094
Friends,
the goal of meditation
is to clear our minds.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.196
Inevitably, certain thoughts
will sneak in,

08:49.229 --> 08:53.400
but it's important
to acknowledge
and then release them.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.569
What I like to say
to these thoughts is,

08:55.603 --> 08:57.905
"Thank you. Not now."

08:59.406 --> 09:02.242
So let's close our eyes
and begin.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.543
(CHIME RINGS)

09:05.713 --> 09:07.547
ALLISON: (SIGHS) Finally.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.750
Sweet silence.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.451
Just what I needed.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.621
Oh, wait.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.823
I'm not supposed
to be thinking.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.091
Thank you. Not now.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.532
Man, Ken was right.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.635
The silence is awkward.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.037
Ugh, Ken is so annoying.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.440
You know what, Ken?
Thank you. Not now.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.745
CLARK: Ah, pure silence.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.013
Nope, someone's wheezing.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.715
Hmm, that could be asthma.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.584
I'm a good nurse.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.920
Okay, meditation, take two.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.223
Do I have bananas at home?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.960
(GROANS)
Why can't I clear my head?
I should be good at this.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.996
I'm a vegan.
This is on brand for me.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.232
Maybe I can't
turn my brain off
'cause it's made of meat.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.334
Thank you. Not now.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.437
(GROANS) Look at Allison.

10:04.471 --> 10:07.207
How is she so Zen?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.942
Well, I guess she's learned
to block things out

10:08.976 --> 10:12.312
in order to deal with Ken.

10:12.345 --> 10:16.116
ALLISON: This place
was so much better
as a Jamaican restaurant.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.851
Hey, wait a second.

start a business
that combines the two...

Nah, who am I kidding?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
I'm sure someone's
already done it.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.531
There really are no new ideas.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.802
CLARK: I swear,
if it weren't for Allison,

10:34.835 --> 10:36.436
I would get up and leave.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.405
But I'm stuck.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.241
(GASPS) Unless...

10:41.274 --> 10:44.411
What if I gave myself
a nosebleed?

10:48.215 --> 10:50.751
ALLISON:
Man, he is in the zone.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.452
*

10:54.621 --> 10:56.323
Okay, clearly the Benadryl
isn't working,

10:56.356 --> 10:59.492
so I'm gonna have
to notch you up to Prednisone.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.829
(SIGHS)
This better work.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.263
Megan is not happy.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.098
I'm gonna ruin her banquet,
and she cannot have that.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.967
She made that
very clear!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.702
Ken, what is causing
these hives?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.270
Well, all your allergy tests
are negative.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.073
So maybe
it could be stress.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.142
Ah. You may be right.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.578
Maybe Megan and I
should take a little break.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.313
You know,
I'm so glad you said that.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.349
You know,
just get out of town,
just the two of us.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.686
Are things ever...

11:26.720 --> 11:29.022
Stressful between
you and Megan?

11:29.056 --> 11:30.490
No, no.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.160
Megan insists on a stress-free
environment, and I comply.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.162
I'm terrified of getting
on her bad side.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.130
Is that terror ever...

11:37.998 --> 11:39.833
Stressful?

11:39.867 --> 11:42.135
Ken, I have no idea
what you're driving at.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.470
Pat, you're allergic
to Megan

11:43.503 --> 11:45.005
and you need to
break up with her!

11:46.807 --> 11:50.811
Are you actually suggesting
that Megan is responsible
for my hives?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.545
That is ridiculous.

11:52.579 --> 11:56.683
You have stress urticaria.
Megan is bad for you.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.185
Look at your face.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.322
Ken, I know you and the others
don't care for her,

12:02.355 --> 12:05.092
but to suggest she is
responsible for my condition

12:05.125 --> 12:07.761
is medically irresponsible
and personally offensive.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.329
You're fired
as my doctor.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.432
I don't know why you begged me
to let you examine me.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.502
I was the one
who told you to go to Tuttle
in the first place!

12:15.535 --> 12:17.137
And you should have listened!

12:17.170 --> 12:18.939
Okay, okay.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.309
I'm talking to you
as a friend.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.611
Pat, if we don't care
for Megan,

12:24.644 --> 12:26.847
it's because of how much
we care about you.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.350
She is stressing you out,
and it's making you sick.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.021
Either your relationship
has to change,
or you need to end it.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.323
Wow. (SIGHS)

12:37.190 --> 12:40.160
So that's what
you call friendship?

12:40.193 --> 12:43.563
I thought friends wanted
each other to be happy.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.099
I don't know if you can tell,
but under this rash...

12:46.666 --> 12:48.268
I am red with anger!

12:58.311 --> 13:00.280
Hey. I'm...
Hey, hey.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.353
Why haven't you
returned my calls?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.388
I was stalling.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.758
I was hoping my face
would improve.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.127
Well, it hasn't.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.595
And the banquet's
in a few hours.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.764
I thought you were
gonna talk to Ken.
What did he say?

13:20.433 --> 13:23.070
What the hell does he know?
He's like the tenth-best
doctor here.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.271
(MOUTHING)

13:24.905 --> 13:26.173
Well, it doesn't matter.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.441
There's no way
I can take you
to the banquet.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.611
Everyone's gonna mistake
your face for the prime rib.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.515
You know, Megan,

13:35.548 --> 13:38.118
as much as I usually
find your honesty refreshing,

13:38.151 --> 13:39.786
that kind of stung a little.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.555
Oh, you're gonna
make this all about you?

13:42.589 --> 13:45.225
(LAUGHS) Wow.
That's rich.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.029
Forget it. I will see you
after the banquet.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.533
Megan, wait.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.236
I'm not so sure
you will see me.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.838
Excuse me?

13:59.907 --> 14:01.308
Look, maybe
we should talk privately.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.611
Wait, are you...
Are you breaking up
with me?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.113
Oh, it's showtime.

14:08.781 --> 14:12.652
Yes, you won't see me
after the banquet
because this is over.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.025
No one breaks up
with Megan.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.133
Well, Pat does.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.035
Why? Give me
one good reason.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.702
Well, Ken says
you're killing me.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.208
I said it was
stress urticaria,
a vascular rash,

14:35.242 --> 14:37.144
which is very itchy...
Shut up.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.578
Yes, sir.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.481
You're really gonna
throw this all this away

14:41.514 --> 14:44.484
because of some
silly rash?

14:44.517 --> 14:47.187
Every relationship
has issues.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.489
One of my exes even suffered
from panic attacks.

14:49.522 --> 14:54.794
Oh, and always felt an
overwhelming sense
of doom around me,

14:54.827 --> 14:56.829
but I didn't hear him
complaining.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.732
Was that 'cause
he was dead?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.870
I'm on the phone,
Megan.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.842
I think this is best
for both of us. And I'm...

15:11.344 --> 15:12.946
I'm sorry, Megan.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.583
You know what, Pat?
I don't care what you say.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.052
This relationship
is over.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.353
(GASPS)

15:20.387 --> 15:22.622
Nuh-uh! Nuh-uh!
Don't do that!

15:22.655 --> 15:24.524
He broke up with you!

15:25.358 --> 15:27.094
You broke up with her!

15:28.895 --> 15:30.363
See, I can't...

15:31.098 --> 15:33.266
*

15:35.502 --> 15:38.738
(SIGHS) Emily,
I know it's not your thing,

15:38.771 --> 15:40.640
but we need to talk.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.343
I think you're
a wonderful person.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.744
Oh, thank God.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.647
I'm sorry?
Let's face it.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.749
This thing's
been over for weeks.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.985
It has?

15:52.019 --> 15:54.587
We've obviously
just been going through
the motions.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.756
Honestly, I was only
dragging my feet

15:56.789 --> 15:58.258
because I was afraid
to be single again.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.561
But this is
the right thing to do.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.097
It is?
It is.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.199
(SIGHS) Wow.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.669
I feel like a big bag of rocks
has been lifted off my back.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.072
Bye, Dave. Be well.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.677
Did not see that coming.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.213
*

16:22.649 --> 16:24.117
Oh, hey, girl.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.985
So, what'd you think
of the meditation?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.488
So good.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.591
Super mindful.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.693
If anything,
I wish it was longer.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.662
You want to go
again tomorrow?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.764
What are you doing, Clark?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.300
You betcha.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.635
No, no betcha.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.237
This ends now.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.140
Clark,
I got to be honest.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.341
I didn't like it.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.509
Me neither.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.245
But why didn't you
say anything?

16:52.279 --> 16:54.714
Well, you invited me,
and I didn't want you
to feel badly.

16:54.747 --> 16:55.982
Okay, you know what?
From now on,

16:56.015 --> 16:57.450
let's just be honest
with each other, okay?

16:57.484 --> 16:58.851
Absolutely.
Okay.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.721
You want to grab some lunch?
I know this vegan
stromboli place.

17:01.754 --> 17:05.292
Ooh, uh, I'm not really
feeling vegan stromboli.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.826
Hey, how about Jamaican?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.761
Totally fine.
Wherever you want to go.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.997
Why is she trying
to hurt me?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.401
ALLISON: He's so strong.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.936
That rejection
would've crushed me.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.207
You know what?
I'm gonna reward him.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.009
Hey, let's try your place.
I'm sure it's great.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.777
Oh, okay. Great.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.746
Oh, now
I'm a charity case?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.817
ALLISON: Why did you give in?
He doesn't even care!

17:31.918 --> 17:34.020
This will be fun.
Yeah!

17:34.787 --> 17:37.224
*

17:39.559 --> 17:40.760
What's going on?

17:40.793 --> 17:43.029
Dave kicked Emily
to the curb.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.999
So you did it.
How do you feel?

17:47.033 --> 17:50.137
Like the victim
of a cosmic sucker punch.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.005
But I thought
this is what you wanted.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.175
I thought so, too.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.510
I just didn't expect Emily
to be so onboard with it.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.646
It's strange.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.880
Even when you know
it's over,

18:00.913 --> 18:03.883
you still want
the other person
to want you.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.186
I gave her
the best months
of my life.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.923
Well, you're 11.
You've got some good months
ahead of you still.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.559
Thanks, Molly.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.194
Mmm!

18:15.328 --> 18:18.965
Dave, when you find
the right one,
you'll know it.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.901
How?
She'll talk!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.803
What is wrong with her?

18:24.737 --> 18:26.639
(BOTH LAUGH)

18:29.709 --> 18:31.844
Hey. Ken,
you got a minute?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.381
Sure.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.049
I just wanted to thank you
for figuring out
what was wrong with me

18:37.083 --> 18:41.321
and, more importantly,
for your friendship.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.290
You're very welcome.
For both.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.493
Deep down, I...
I knew you were right
all along.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.928
That was not
a healthy relationship.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.499
So on some level, I felt
even an unhealthy relationship

18:52.532 --> 18:54.301
was preferable
to being alone.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.470
Yeah, you know,
Allison's always
saying that.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.640
I'm grateful you were there to
teach me that age-old lesson.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.443
It's better to be somewhat
unhappy with clear skin

19:03.476 --> 19:06.579
than be extremely unhappy
with a debilitating rash.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.550
Well, I'm glad
it all worked out.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.852
Me, too. All right.
Well, thanks again.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.955
So, does this mean I move up
in the doctor rankings?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.190
No, Ken, it does not.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.926
*

19:23.930 --> 19:26.199
Hey, Pat, how ya doing?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.335
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.770
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay 'cause...

19:30.803 --> 19:33.105
Man, that breakup of yours
was kind of rough.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.542
But I guess rough is what
breakups are, right?

19:35.575 --> 19:37.677
I suppose.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.379
Well, you and me,
that wasn't so bad.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.080
(LAUGHS) That's true.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.516
Yeah. In fact, I think
that was the best breakup
I ever had.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.352
(LAUGHS)

19:45.385 --> 19:47.754
You know what?
It was my best one, too.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.155
Ah, and your face
is looking better.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.424
Oh, thanks.
Yours, too. I...

19:53.260 --> 19:54.761
I'm still...

19:54.794 --> 19:56.629
I'm still in
a bit of a daze.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.097
Oh. Well, the prednisone?

19:58.130 --> 20:00.367
Actually, I never
took it. Hmm.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.402
I started feeling better
the moment she left here.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.705
(CHUCKLES) Funny.
You never gave me hives.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.307
That's 'cause
I'm not scary.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.908
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:14.947 --> 20:16.148
Um...

20:17.484 --> 20:18.651
Well, I'm glad
you're okay.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.487
Me, too.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.556
I knew she was
a mixed bag of nuts.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.224
Tell me about it.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.093
(LAUGHS)

20:32.832 --> 20:35.201
Hey, guys. I want to thank
you both for something.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.969
For what?
You're welcome.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.872
I broke up with Emily,

20:39.906 --> 20:43.443
and while I know
you guys had your own opinions
on our relationship,

20:43.476 --> 20:46.413
I appreciate you giving me
the space to figure things out
on my own.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.382
Uh-huh.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.951
Not only did you teach
a man how to fish,

20:51.984 --> 20:54.020
you taught him
how to throw one back.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.725
You know, every time
I think you guys

20:58.758 --> 21:00.760
are just making it up
as you go,

21:00.793 --> 21:03.195
I wind up
pleasantly surprised.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.300
I'm sorry.
What happened?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.369
Who cares?
Just take the win.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.305
