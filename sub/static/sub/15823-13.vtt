What a shame.

02:15.518 --> 02:18.783
Two grown men get into a knife-fight
in front of holiday shoppers...

02:18.955 --> 02:22.584
...and handed you an attempted murder
case the day before Christmas Eve.

02:22.759 --> 02:24.556
Oh, the attempted murder part
is over.

02:24.727 --> 02:28.026
The victim is now getting medical
treatment for a wound on his hand.

02:28.198 --> 02:31.065
And the would-be killer is dead,
hit by a patrol car...

02:31.234 --> 02:33.794

a use-of-force investigation.

we could call this a traffic accident.

how to find me.

- L.A. Unified shut down for the holidays.

Give him to me. He's my dog.

13:33.062 --> 13:36.327
MAN: Stop. Police.
Hey, kid, you gotta bring that back.

13:36.832 --> 13:40.233
I hate to ask you this, but would
you ride with the boy downtown...

13:40.402 --> 13:44.133
...if Ms. Marku was his mother.
- How much you want me to tell him?

13:44.306 --> 13:46.331
Until we know what's going on,
very little.

13:46.509 --> 13:48.374

Stop right there! Stop!

13:48.544 --> 13:51.206
- And let him keep his dog.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Let's get that woman over to the morgue
as quickly as possible.

after today, are we?

I'll be investigating your victim
for murder. You can leave.

because I'm driving to Palm Springs.

I appreciate you special-requesting me
all the time, chief.

But I'm resigned to missing you
for a week, starting tomorrow.

I understand, doctor, but there's a child
involved. We have to find out...

14:50.573 --> 14:53.508
...who killed his mother.
- God. That's terrible.

forgetting while I'm in Palm Springs.

This man who got mowed over
by the car?

15:00.549 --> 15:03.177
Sitting next to his spinal column
was an old bullet.

15:04.186 --> 15:05.813
- How old?
- Hard to say.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.752
- Years at least.
- Can you dig it out for us?

poolside?

15:11.193 --> 15:13.286
I need to know the origin
of that bullet.

15:13.462 --> 15:15.487
- Where are these people from?
- Kosovo.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.862
Well, then it probably came from there.
I mean, it's a troubled part of the world.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.866

15:22.071 --> 15:24.369
Having her jugular cut was not great.

15:24.573 --> 15:28.942
But in some ways,
a lot less traumatic than her past.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.447
- These burns?
- Oh.

15:32.615 --> 15:34.708
Looks like torture to me.

He's also 300(d), chief.
No legal guardian.

Children's Services insists on placing him
before the holiday shutdown tomorrow.

16:28.370 --> 16:31.567
- What did you tell him?
- Like you asked, I was pretty vague.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.708
I said that his mom and his grandpa...

16:33.876 --> 16:38.245
...wouldn't be coming home for a few
days and, uh, he would be safe with us.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.941
He just stared at me.
He didn't ask a single question.

So Marku takes the kid,
that makes Children's Services happy.

exam for the boy before we release him.

a doctor before they go home.

- Did he ever fight with your mom?
- I guess.

- I don't know.

26:07.515 --> 26:10.450
And what didn't fit in the RV,
we towed in the car.

26:10.619 --> 26:13.281
You towed a car
all the way across America?

26:13.455 --> 26:18.859
Brenda, we are on what is known
in the Navy as a repositioning cruise.

26:19.027 --> 26:22.463
Besides, we can't go house-hunting
in the motor home.

26:22.631 --> 26:26.226
Well, Daddy, if you brought Christmas
with you, where are all the presents?

26:26.401 --> 26:31.168
Staying locked up in the RV
until Christmas morning, Brenda Leigh.

26:31.339 --> 26:34.137
- No peeking.
- Oh, Mama.

26:34.309 --> 26:35.970
Real corn bread.

26:36.144 --> 26:40.706
Black-eyed peas,
collard greens, chocolate pralines.

26:40.882 --> 26:43.373
Ah, ah, ah. Don't spoil your dinner.

26:43.551 --> 26:46.577
Let's everybody come sit down.

26:46.788 --> 26:50.315
- You all finished with your case?
- I think so.

26:50.492 --> 26:53.393
The man who was hit by a patrol car
this morning...

26:53.561 --> 26:57.088
...sliced his daughter's throat
before he went out to stab his son.

26:57.299 --> 26:59.494
And he left behind
an 11-year-old boy...

26:59.668 --> 27:02.398
...that I had to convince
his daughter-in-law to take in.

27:02.570 --> 27:04.561
But now that that's done,
I think that...

27:04.739 --> 27:08.038
All right, then,
I think it's time for the blessing. Clay?

27:08.209 --> 27:11.508
- Well, unless you usually do it...
- No, no. All yours.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.341
All right. Ahem.

27:14.816 --> 27:19.253
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.
Amen.

27:24.125 --> 27:29.188
So your case will be over
by Christmas, right?

27:29.364 --> 27:31.195
Oh, I'm already done.

27:31.366 --> 27:34.563
Well, I need to figure out
the exact time of the mother's death...

27:34.736 --> 27:37.728
...and I wish I felt better
about the boy's situation, but...

27:38.907 --> 27:42.104
But... Mama, you made enough food
here for an army.

27:42.277 --> 27:43.608
This is gonna be good.

27:43.778 --> 27:47.544
- Wonderful meal, Mama.
- Pie for breakfast. Nightie-night.

27:47.716 --> 27:49.240
- Good night.
- Sounds good.

27:50.752 --> 27:56.554
Oh, I'm so glad you're excited
about them moving out here.

27:56.925 --> 28:00.554
- It's been life-changing already.
- It's not like they'll be living with us.

28:00.729 --> 28:04.859
- Just nearby.
- Oh, right here in L.A.

28:05.367 --> 28:08.962
All winter. Maybe spring.

28:11.473 --> 28:12.633
What are we gonna do?

28:13.174 --> 28:17.110
If Delk disbands Major Crimes,
maybe I could put in for a transfer to D.C.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.303
Oh, forget that.

28:19.481 --> 28:21.346
We need something right now.

28:21.516 --> 28:25.509
Like Homeland Security
going from orange to red.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.285
Is there anything special
you want from Santa this year?

28:30.458 --> 28:32.653
Maybe an Albanian translator.

28:32.827 --> 28:37.389
Oh, you are so hard to shop for.

28:40.201 --> 28:42.465
- What is that?
- Oh.

28:42.637 --> 28:45.128
Your father wanted
to put up lawn ornaments.

28:45.306 --> 28:49.072
I lied. I told him the landlord
wouldn't allow them in the front.

28:54.282 --> 28:57.445
Oh, they brought Frosty.

28:58.219 --> 29:03.555
Look at you.
Now it really is Christmas.

29:03.725 --> 29:05.784
Frosty.

29:07.962 --> 29:09.953
[RINGING]

29:12.167 --> 29:14.067
- Yes, lieutenant?
- Yeah.

29:14.235 --> 29:16.465
Remember the case we solved
last night?

29:16.638 --> 29:20.130
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well, merry Christmas...

29:20.308 --> 29:23.709
...because Gabriel went
and unsolved it.

29:23.878 --> 29:25.869
GABRIEL:
It's not my fault.

29:26.047 --> 29:27.446
What's not your fault?

29:28.016 --> 29:30.814
Going through
Anila Marku's financials...

29:30.985 --> 29:32.384
Lieutenant Tao?

29:32.954 --> 29:35.388
At the time her father
was attacking her brother...

29:35.557 --> 29:38.355
...Anila was withdrawing cash
from an ATM.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.016
So he couldn't have killed her.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.390
Banks,
who knows if their clocks are right?

29:44.332 --> 29:45.424
Okay. Sorry.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.160
But my ex-wife invited me
to Christmas Eve dinner.

29:48.336 --> 29:49.769
The first time in six years.

29:49.971 --> 29:52.906
- I'm defrosting two turkeys.
GABRIEL: My flight leaves in four hours.

29:53.074 --> 29:54.564
So <i>arrivederci</i> Roma.

29:54.742 --> 29:57.040
It's not my fault
our time line just blew up.

29:57.212 --> 30:01.171
But, chief, you promised we'd be
where we're supposed to be at Christmas.

30:01.349 --> 30:04.910
You are. You're here. Because there's
a murder and it hasn't been solved.

30:05.487 --> 30:07.853
And my mama makes enough food
for a hundred...

30:08.022 --> 30:12.425
...so y'all are invited over for
Christmas dinner, okay? What else?

30:13.595 --> 30:16.496
Oh, looks like everybody
gets holiday pay today.

30:17.265 --> 30:19.062
Aloha Bowl. My office. Two hours.

30:20.268 --> 30:23.499
"Aloha." It means hello and goodbye.

30:24.072 --> 30:28.600
The Markus paid for an Internet connection,
but there's no computer in their apartment.

30:28.776 --> 30:31.108
- It's missing?
- That explains why there's no phone.

30:31.279 --> 30:33.679
It's cheaper to make overseas calls
with a computer.

30:33.848 --> 30:36.715
- To his sister in Kosovo, maybe.
- Excuse me, chief.

30:36.885 --> 30:39.877
I got ahold of the principal
at Skander's school personally...

30:40.054 --> 30:42.079
...and she just sent me
the student roster.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.623
There's no Rudy,
Rudolpho, Rudolph...

30:44.792 --> 30:46.657
- No Donner, no Blitzen...
- Lieutenant.

30:46.828 --> 30:49.422
And when you look
at Skander's school record...

30:49.597 --> 30:52.122
...it shows the school issued him
a laptop computer.

30:52.300 --> 30:56.066
Okay. Lieutenant Provenza, I wanna talk
to that boy again, please. Thank you.

30:56.237 --> 30:58.137
RAYDOR:
Chief.

30:58.306 --> 31:00.866
I thought you were going to your parents'
for Christmas.

31:01.042 --> 31:05.172
I am. They're at their timeshare
in Park City skiing with my kids.

31:05.346 --> 31:07.405
Oh, so your father
must be feeling better?

31:07.582 --> 31:11.484
Yes, it turns out it was just a really,
really bad cold, and it's all cleared up.

31:11.653 --> 31:13.280
It's a little Christmas miracle.

31:13.454 --> 31:15.820
But I wanna thank you
for being so helpful.

31:15.990 --> 31:18.584
And I have a little present for you.

31:19.060 --> 31:21.585
Really? Oh, you shouldn't have.

31:21.763 --> 31:25.358
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not that kind
of present. It's the 911 calls.

31:25.567 --> 31:27.125
This is really interesting.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.430
In the background,
you can hear the two men arguing.

31:30.605 --> 31:32.835
- Really?
- Except, there's all kinds of noise.

31:33.007 --> 31:35.202
Plus, they're yelling
in a foreign language...

31:35.376 --> 31:38.038
...so I sent the tapes down
to the sound lab for you.

31:38.212 --> 31:41.045
Who knows when they'll have them
ready? Anyway, follow up.

31:41.215 --> 31:45.549
- And, everyone, merry Christmas.
- You too.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.382
And happy, happy New Year.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.655
I hate her.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.887
Did I say that out loud?

31:56.097 --> 31:58.122
Go ahead. Go ahead. Have a seat.

31:58.900 --> 32:01.869
This is the second time
we've had to drop our kids...

32:02.036 --> 32:05.494
...with my parents in two days.
Skander has been through enough.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.904
What's so pressing
that it can't wait until after Christmas?

32:09.844 --> 32:12.312
We have learned
that Skander was not truthful...

32:12.480 --> 32:15.415
...about where he was yesterday
during his mother's murder.

32:17.251 --> 32:20.243
Okay, wait a second. You brought
us down here to question him?

32:21.489 --> 32:24.583
I need him to tell me where he was
during his mother's murder...

32:24.759 --> 32:27.023
...and what happened
to his computer.

32:27.528 --> 32:30.691
Skander's not responsible for her death.
My father is.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.833
Our investigation confirms
your sister...

32:33.001 --> 32:36.402
...was alive when your father
attacked you, so he didn't kill her.

32:38.706 --> 32:43.439
If you're insinuating Skander is somehow
a suspect in his mother's murder...

32:43.645 --> 32:46.273
...I'm officially letting you know,
he has a lawyer.

32:46.447 --> 32:49.939
Me. And he's not talking to you.

32:51.085 --> 32:52.950
Miss Marku, I'm surprised.

32:53.154 --> 32:55.520
You were afraid to let Skander
into your house.

32:55.690 --> 32:59.786
I didn't wanna have to explain to
another child he's lost his entire family.

33:00.161 --> 33:03.858
But now I have no choice because I
certainly don't trust you people to do it.

33:04.032 --> 33:06.296
Well, I need to know
how he lost that family.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.367
Yeah. Well, that's your job, not ours.

33:16.611 --> 33:19.045
Look, I need your help.

33:19.213 --> 33:21.238
Mr. and Mrs. Marku, please.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.677
You are putting your family at risk.

33:28.289 --> 33:29.415
POPE:
What's up?

33:29.590 --> 33:32.320
That boy's the only suspect
in his mother's murder...

33:32.493 --> 33:34.723
...and he's leaving.
- I'll take care of it.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.231
- Officer Butler, with me.
- Yes, sir.

33:45.473 --> 33:47.634
Howdy, folks.

33:48.810 --> 33:50.971
I'm Chief of Police William Pope.

33:52.080 --> 33:56.517
Ahem. So you excited about Christmas,
young man?

33:58.853 --> 34:02.687
Okay, well, happy holidays to you, folks.
One second there, son.

34:02.857 --> 34:04.324
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute.

34:04.492 --> 34:06.517
- What are you doing?
- You have no right.

34:06.728 --> 34:09.719
Actually, I do. Because you,
young man, are under arrest.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.645
Back so soon? How were the slopes?

34:31.819 --> 34:34.549
Did you just arrest
a 10-year-old Albanian boy?

34:34.722 --> 34:36.882
Albanian-American boy.
I thought he was 11.

34:37.091 --> 34:38.614
Yeah, 11.

34:38.793 --> 34:41.489
- About so high? Murder suspect?
- Yes.

34:41.661 --> 34:43.822
I may have had something
to do with that. Why?

34:43.998 --> 34:48.331
Because his aunt, Joan Marku,
marched over to Central Division...

34:48.503 --> 34:51.529
...to file a kidnapping charge
and a civil rights complaint.

34:51.706 --> 34:54.139
That's easy.
He wasn't kidnapped, he was arrested.

34:54.308 --> 34:57.209
And he's a juvenile,
so he won't even wind up in court...

34:57.378 --> 35:00.814
...where a lawyer could use
a rights violation to threaten us.

35:00.982 --> 35:06.079
Oh, well, she is threatening you
currently with a rights violation.

35:06.254 --> 35:08.518
She identified herself as his lawyer...

35:08.689 --> 35:12.386
...and you are denying him counsel.
- Don't worry, he ain't talking.

35:12.760 --> 35:15.923
Well, I am talking
and you both better listen.

35:16.564 --> 35:21.024
In the process of creating this miasma
of officer-involved incidents...

35:21.202 --> 35:24.933
...did you also order someone
to physically assault Armand Marku?

35:25.640 --> 35:29.701
No. I prevented Mr. Marku from
injuring his arm in the elevator door.

35:29.877 --> 35:34.211
The charges are without merit, and you
may take that as my official statement.

35:34.382 --> 35:39.376
Oh, thank you. I'm just gonna jot this
down on my way back to the airport.

35:39.554 --> 35:45.959
Oh, wait. I can't go to the airport yet
because I have to file a report about you.

35:46.160 --> 35:49.027
To you.
And I have to interview the victim.

35:49.197 --> 35:51.097
So where's the boy?

35:52.200 --> 35:54.760
BUZZ: Wow, Mrs. Johnson,
this looks delicious.

35:54.936 --> 35:56.927
It's just leftovers.

35:57.104 --> 35:59.538
Can you imagine cooking a meal
in here?

35:59.707 --> 36:02.403
I guess if you brought in
a Broaster and a Crock-Pot.

36:03.878 --> 36:06.711
- Aren't you hungry, Brenda Leigh?
- No, Daddy.

36:06.881 --> 36:08.542
Where's Lieutenant Provenza?

36:08.716 --> 36:10.877
I'm bringing food for him and Skander,
ma'am.

36:11.052 --> 36:13.987
Maybe black-eyed peas
and fried okra will get him to talk.

36:14.388 --> 36:16.754
This is crazy.
Why don't we just ask if he did it?

36:16.924 --> 36:20.121
What if he confesses?
He's got a lawyer. She's not present.

36:20.294 --> 36:23.320
He's a juvenile, but... I don't know.

36:24.999 --> 36:27.160
- Captain, I thought you were...
- Not anymore.

36:27.335 --> 36:29.929
I am, once again,
in a 72-hour reporting cycle...

36:30.104 --> 36:33.938
...for an officer-related assault
involving our acting chief of police...

36:34.108 --> 36:36.008
...and your suspect is my witness,
so...

36:36.210 --> 36:38.440
- Oh, it's a little Christmas miracle.
- What is?

36:38.613 --> 36:41.605
We're not sure if we can interview
the boy, but you have to.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.342
I've just got a couple questions
I need you to ask.

36:44.518 --> 36:47.453
As soon as I finish asking questions,
I'll ask some of yours.

36:47.622 --> 36:50.216
But then I want a police escort
to LAX.

36:50.391 --> 36:51.517
Done.

36:56.931 --> 37:00.867
So can you tell me which policeman
pushed your uncle?

37:01.035 --> 37:02.127
The bald one.

37:05.106 --> 37:08.166
- And then what happened?
- If I say, will you let me go?

37:08.342 --> 37:12.938
If you can tell me what happened
after the policeman pushed your uncle...

37:13.114 --> 37:16.948
...then, yes, I can help you go home.

37:17.785 --> 37:19.810
He didn't push my uncle.

37:20.388 --> 37:21.650
He didn't?

37:23.357 --> 37:24.722
He punched him in the face.

37:24.892 --> 37:27.759
Then took out his gun
and pointed it at my head.

37:29.664 --> 37:33.031
Skander, are you sure about that?

37:33.200 --> 37:35.668
Yeah.
Then he shoved me in a closet...

37:35.836 --> 37:38.999
...put a blindfold on me,
and told me to lie down on the floor.

37:41.075 --> 37:42.269
Oh, God.

37:43.711 --> 37:46.976
And then he tied me up
and said he was gonna kill me.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.714
- All those things crossed my mind.
- Brenda Leigh.

37:49.884 --> 37:51.249
Mama, please, not now.

37:51.419 --> 37:53.546
And then he kicked me
in the stomach.

37:58.826 --> 38:01.693
- It's true.
- Okay. Okay.

38:02.096 --> 38:04.690
This is some very, very bad stuff.

38:05.499 --> 38:11.495
And that bald policeman
is in big, big trouble.

38:12.974 --> 38:15.204
Ugh. This isn't helping me at all.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.209
You don't really have to ask the boy
questions.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.437
Mama, yes, I do.

38:19.613 --> 38:24.448
No, no, what I mean is,
whenever we had trouble with Charlie...

38:24.618 --> 38:26.711
...we let her use Clay's laptop.

38:26.887 --> 38:30.414
When she was done,
we'd read over some of her e-mails.

38:30.591 --> 38:32.388
Mama, you spied on Charlie?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.118
Oh, yes.

38:34.328 --> 38:36.694
Well, it was our computer,
Brenda Leigh.

38:37.131 --> 38:41.932
I know that sounds bad,
but it's not against the law.

38:42.103 --> 38:43.730
Is it?

38:45.406 --> 38:47.840
All right. Come on. Come on.
Have a seat.

38:48.476 --> 38:51.912
Now, there's all kinds of games on there.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.273
Knock yourself out.

38:54.915 --> 38:58.248
Only thing is, stay off the Internet.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.353
Against police rules.

39:08.295 --> 39:11.594
Okay. So this is a mirror image
of the commander's computer.

39:11.766 --> 39:14.826
We can track everything
the boy is doing as he does it.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.246
Okay, "Saramed."
Is that some kind of Albanian name?

39:30.418 --> 39:31.942
It's an instant message tag.

39:32.386 --> 39:33.512
Here he goes again.

39:47.001 --> 39:48.764
BRENDA:
So I think he's talking to his aunt.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.298
And if he is,
why did he tell us she was in Kosovo?

39:52.807 --> 39:55.037
Oh, he went into e-mail.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.375
Sara Miller, St. Sebastian Hospital.

40:00.548 --> 40:04.040
All right. All right.
I'll call the hospital.

40:20.234 --> 40:21.997
Blood food? What is he talking about?

40:22.169 --> 40:24.899
I think that's "feud." Not "food."

40:25.072 --> 40:28.530
Joan Marku said something about
family honor being sacred in Kosovo...

40:28.709 --> 40:33.408
...that it was some kind of old code
of justice that went back centuries.

40:33.581 --> 40:35.674
I'm gonna look all that up
on Wikipedia.

40:36.250 --> 40:38.241
Here. Use my computer.

40:38.452 --> 40:41.353
Okay. Spoke to the hospital.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.218
There's a Sara Marku Miller
who's an RN there.

40:44.391 --> 40:46.359
Her husband died,
but she kept his name.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.587
- And I have her address.
- So she's been here the whole time.

41:13.687 --> 41:17.623
Ms. Miller? It's the police. Sara?

41:17.791 --> 41:19.850
Chief,
I can't make out anything inside.

41:20.027 --> 41:22.120
I hear music. Let's break it down.

41:25.499 --> 41:27.126
Side door was forced open.

41:27.301 --> 41:29.292
["SILENT NIGHT" PLAYING ON STEREO]

41:33.307 --> 41:35.798
FLYNN:
Chief, in here.

41:37.878 --> 41:39.072
[GROANS]

41:47.988 --> 41:51.856
I don't know what this blood feud's about,
but no one else is gonna die from it.

41:54.295 --> 41:58.231
Uh, call Chief Pope,
tell him we need 24-hour protection...

41:58.399 --> 42:01.527
...assigned to Joan Armand
and Skander Marku. All of them.
