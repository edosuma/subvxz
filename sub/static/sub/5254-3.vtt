00:00.154 --> 00:01.385
Previously on Faking It...

00:01.415 --> 00:03.452
Last week, a total of three 
people knew our names,

00:03.482 --> 00:05.153
and one of them was Irma the lunch lady.

00:05.183 --> 00:06.799
You have to admit this is working for us.

00:06.801 --> 00:08.134
I had no idea this whole time

00:08.135 --> 00:09.203
that you've been having these feelings.

00:09.233 --> 00:11.576
Well, we can't figure it out
if we don't talk about it.

00:11.606 --> 00:13.645
I was born with XY chromosomes,

00:13.675 --> 00:14.975
but I developed as a female.

00:14.977 --> 00:16.109
You have something to say, say it.

00:16.139 --> 00:17.316
She kept Amy's secret.

00:17.346 --> 00:19.512
She basically chose her over me.

00:21.483 --> 00:22.921
Do we have to do this?

00:22.951 --> 00:24.152
The last time we broke up,

00:24.182 --> 00:26.475
principal Penelope had to
call in a grief counselor.

00:26.505 --> 00:28.093
This is a fresh start for us.

00:28.123 --> 00:30.206
No more secrets, no lies.

00:32.210 --> 00:34.828
So we're just gonna tell everyone

00:34.858 --> 00:36.329
we faked being a lesbian couple?

00:36.781 --> 00:38.731
Let's not go that far.
They'd skin us alive.

00:38.733 --> 00:40.960
We'll just tell them that
we're consciously uncoupling.

00:42.403 --> 00:43.753
What? We are.

00:43.783 --> 00:46.339
And then you'll be the most
eligible lesbian on campus,

00:46.341 --> 00:48.372
and we'll land you a
smokin' hot girlfriend.

00:49.193 --> 00:51.393
Come on! It's just what you need.

00:54.165 --> 00:56.615
What are you gonna do, fire starter?

00:58.269 --> 00:59.852
I don't know, lay low,

01:00.139 --> 01:03.022
eventually drift back in to dating guys.

01:04.742 --> 01:06.359
Just the power couple I was looking for.

01:06.361 --> 01:09.093
Penelope, we have some bad news.

01:09.123 --> 01:09.946
Oh, dear.

01:09.948 --> 01:11.607
Okay. I'm all ears.

01:12.167 --> 01:13.167
Um...

01:14.870 --> 01:16.920
Every relationship is a journey,

01:17.166 --> 01:19.873
and on that journey, there are detours,

01:19.875 --> 01:22.876
a, um... a fork in the road, so to speak.

01:22.878 --> 01:24.711
We've consciously uncoupled.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.546
I am so sorry to hear that.

01:26.548 --> 01:27.797
I hope you two keep it civil.

01:27.799 --> 01:28.965
I've seen enough lesbian breakups

01:28.967 --> 01:30.383
to know how brutal they can be.

01:30.703 --> 01:32.068
Okay, I would love to check in 
with your feelings,

01:32.098 --> 01:34.656
but at any minute, a busload of refugees

01:34.686 --> 01:36.573
will be arriving from our
sister school in Brazil.

01:36.575 --> 01:37.679
Refugees? What happened?

01:37.709 --> 01:38.708
There was a tragic sinkhole accident.

01:38.710 --> 01:39.782
It just, like......

01:39.812 --> 01:41.300
swallowed up their whole building.

01:41.330 --> 01:42.951
And that's why I was
looking for you, Karma.

01:42.981 --> 01:44.113
I hear you speak Portuguese.

01:44.315 --> 01:45.337
Will you help translate?

01:45.367 --> 01:46.866
We have to make them feel at home.

01:47.396 --> 01:49.096
Okay, great. Gotta run.

01:50.364 --> 01:51.988
Not a single tear?

01:51.990 --> 01:53.790
She didn't even get misty.

01:54.643 --> 01:56.653
I mean yay!

01:57.578 --> 01:58.646
Liam?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.614
Look, about our fight?

02:01.877 --> 02:03.233
I'm sorry.

02:03.335 --> 02:05.524
You know, I want you to know
I am always on team Liam.

02:05.554 --> 02:07.270
In fact, I'm the captain,

02:07.422 --> 02:09.306
and we have these really cute uniforms.

02:09.336 --> 02:12.320
Shane, don't sweat it.

02:12.527 --> 02:13.776
- We're good.
- Really?

02:13.806 --> 02:15.161
'Cause we haven't fought like that

02:15.163 --> 02:16.445
since I outed your G.I. Joes.

02:16.447 --> 02:18.364
You had to bring that back up.

02:18.366 --> 02:20.616
Gung-ho and snow job were not gay.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.285
It was the height of
don't ask, don't tell.

02:22.287 --> 02:23.669
You'd be surprised.

02:23.671 --> 02:25.350
See, this is why I love 
being best friends

02:25.380 --> 02:26.606
with a straight guy.

02:26.636 --> 02:27.974
You know, no drama.

02:27.976 --> 02:29.725
I had enough of that with Pablo.

02:29.727 --> 02:31.627
- We're through.
- Already?

02:31.729 --> 02:32.862
Wow, that must be a new record.

02:32.892 --> 02:34.648
I didn't even get a parting Pablowy.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.705
Did you date him just so 
you could say that?

02:36.735 --> 02:37.767
No!

02:38.228 --> 02:39.235
Well, maybe.

02:39.237 --> 02:40.854
Doesn't matter, now
that we're both single,

02:40.856 --> 02:42.405
let's get back out on the field

02:42.407 --> 02:43.780
and catch some rebounds.

02:43.810 --> 02:44.613
Normally, I would,

02:44.643 --> 02:48.378
but I've decided to bench
my dong for the season.

02:48.408 --> 02:49.865
Boo!

02:50.241 --> 02:52.365
You're still hung up
on Karma, aren't you?

02:52.767 --> 02:53.900
I don't get it.

02:53.930 --> 02:56.235
Are her lips dusted with
cocaine or something?

02:56.237 --> 02:57.704
No, this is not about Karma,

02:57.856 --> 03:00.556
and I'm only hung up on her because...

03:00.908 --> 03:02.806
Little Liam wanted to meet a lesbian,

03:02.836 --> 03:04.627
so he needs to be put in time-out.

03:04.657 --> 03:06.701
Why are you punishing your penis?

03:06.731 --> 03:08.264
Hey, Karma is the one who lied.

03:08.266 --> 03:10.183
Trust me, I deserve to be punished.

03:10.185 --> 03:12.724
No, you deserve to move on,

03:12.754 --> 03:14.438
and the best way to get over someone

03:14.468 --> 03:17.757
is to get under someone new, stat.

03:17.909 --> 03:20.231
Unless you don't want to get over her.

03:20.261 --> 03:22.178
Of course I want to get over her.

03:22.180 --> 03:24.886
I just think celibacy is
the best way to do that.

03:24.916 --> 03:25.699
I don't know.

03:25.729 --> 03:27.799
In my experience, it
only leads to blue balls

03:27.829 --> 03:30.675
and long, incoherent
speeches about wolves.

03:30.705 --> 03:32.433
The Brazilians are coming!

03:32.463 --> 03:34.138
The Brazilians are coming!

03:34.368 --> 03:36.517
Smile, people. We're a
country of immigrants.

Churrasco?

04:02.566 --> 04:04.609
Where's my Crispy Kale Salad, Irma?

04:04.639 --> 04:06.344
I'm not sending you recipes off pinterest

04:06.374 --> 04:07.423
because we're friends.

04:07.453 --> 04:09.865
All this week, we're
serving dishes from Brazil

04:09.895 --> 04:11.800
in honor of our special guests,

04:11.830 --> 04:13.747
so you might want to pack a lunch.

04:15.316 --> 04:17.105
Lauren! Exciting news.

04:17.135 --> 04:18.574
You're finally getting
your hair straightened.

04:18.603 --> 04:20.108
No. This weekend we are throwing

04:20.137 --> 04:21.887
a traditional Brazilian Carnaval.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.428
And by "we", I mean you.

04:24.458 --> 04:25.619
Why on earth would I do that?

04:25.649 --> 04:29.362
Because you blackmailed me
into making you social chair,

04:29.364 --> 04:30.769
so now it's kind of your job.

04:30.799 --> 04:32.682
They're in America now.
Shouldn't they assimilate?

04:32.712 --> 04:34.134
Will you show a little compassion?

04:34.136 --> 04:36.052
These students are
hungry. They're frightened.

04:36.054 --> 04:38.355
Some of them have been brutally injured.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.478
She got a nose job.

04:40.508 --> 04:41.558
Oh, you poor thing.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.114
How did you become so cynical?

04:43.144 --> 04:44.093
If you don't want to do it,

04:44.095 --> 04:45.929
I'm happy to appoint a new chair,

04:46.140 --> 04:48.040
and then they can plan prom.

04:52.174 --> 04:53.403
Oh!

04:53.405 --> 04:55.093
Whoa, darling, where's the fire?

04:55.123 --> 04:55.994
Move it, moron!

04:56.024 --> 04:57.863
I've got things to do, and
all these Brazilian pheromones

04:57.893 --> 04:58.830
are making me nauseous.

04:58.860 --> 05:01.249
So I'm guessing from your
outfit and that clipboard,

05:01.279 --> 05:03.079
you're the H.B.I.C. around here.

05:03.338 --> 05:04.706
Yes, I am.

05:05.084 --> 05:06.415
What exactly does that mean?

05:06.445 --> 05:07.784
Head bitch in charge.

05:07.786 --> 05:09.007
Did you just call me a bitch?

05:09.037 --> 05:11.070
No, no, no! I mean, well, yeah,

05:11.072 --> 05:13.828
but I meant it like,
"it's Brittany, bitch."

05:13.858 --> 05:15.608
You know, not in a bad way.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.409
- Like in a gay way?
- Yeah,

05:17.439 --> 05:18.945
except I'm not gay,

05:18.947 --> 05:20.279
in case you were wondering.

05:21.189 --> 05:22.337
I wasn't.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.882
So where are we with the moving?

05:26.971 --> 05:28.888
No one gives a flying
flip that we broke up.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.774
They're all obsessed with
these Brazilian beauties.

05:31.776 --> 05:35.278
Ooh, speaking of, check
out this coconut flan.

05:36.639 --> 05:40.316
♪ Come smell the fruit ♪

05:40.318 --> 05:44.070
♪ for a while ♪

05:44.072 --> 05:47.206
Share the flan.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.876
Liam!

05:49.878 --> 05:51.628
Come meet my new friends.

05:52.531 --> 05:54.714
This is Francisco.

05:54.716 --> 05:57.466
He's a bench-warmer for
the Brazilian soccer team.

05:59.371 --> 06:00.776
At least that's the story 
I'm telling myself,

06:00.806 --> 06:02.510
because all he talks about is "futebol",

06:02.540 --> 06:04.979
and he's definitely warming my bench.

06:05.009 --> 06:07.959
And these are his friends,
alessandra and Julia.

06:09.493 --> 06:11.285
Hi. How are you liking Austin?

06:11.315 --> 06:12.656
They don't speak a lick of English.

06:12.686 --> 06:15.791
Fortunately, they're fluent 
in body language.

06:17.667 --> 06:18.808
What are you doing?

06:18.838 --> 06:21.824
I'm giving you an opportunity
to forget about Karma.

06:21.826 --> 06:25.169
You know, take the green pill 
or the pink one.

06:25.199 --> 06:25.987
Or both.

06:26.017 --> 06:28.683
You need to stop, all
right? You need to butt out.

06:28.713 --> 06:32.035
And they need protection
from the sun's harmful rays,

06:32.065 --> 06:35.334
especially on their backs.

06:39.861 --> 06:41.828
Um...I gotta go.

06:44.532 --> 06:45.900
Bye.

06:49.488 --> 06:50.920
Tell me everything.

06:51.296 --> 06:53.005
Her name is Fabiana.

06:53.007 --> 06:55.541
She shared the last bite of flan,

06:55.543 --> 06:57.426
which means she's a giver.

06:57.848 --> 06:59.634
That's all I got. She
speaks zero English.

06:59.664 --> 07:00.439
Minor obstacle.

07:00.469 --> 07:02.915
Other than that, everything
is going according to plan.

07:03.127 --> 07:03.964
Plan?

07:03.994 --> 07:06.024
You just landed yourself
a smokin' hot girlfriend.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.671
Karma, we just shared flan.

07:08.673 --> 07:10.840
Please, that was the most
adorable meet-cute ever.

07:11.299 --> 07:12.508
- Meet-cute?
- Yeah.

07:12.510 --> 07:14.093
It's the moment in a romantic comedy

07:14.095 --> 07:15.261
where a girl meets her soul mate

07:15.263 --> 07:16.646
for the first time and sparks fly.

07:16.648 --> 07:18.989
My life is not a romantic comedy.

07:19.019 --> 07:20.505
I can barely stand watching them.

07:20.535 --> 07:22.034
Well, what about pitch perfect?

07:22.520 --> 07:25.705
I like the songs and the vaguely 
feminist message.

07:25.707 --> 07:27.573
All I'm saying is tomorrow's Carnaval

07:27.575 --> 07:30.126
is the perfect place to fall
in love with someone new.

07:30.455 --> 07:33.703
I can't fall in love with
someone I don't understand.

07:33.794 --> 07:35.020
Well, then I'll translate.

07:35.778 --> 07:36.755
Like a chaperone?

07:36.785 --> 07:39.327
No, like C-3PO.

07:39.357 --> 07:41.387
I'm just there to convey information.

07:42.817 --> 07:45.112
Listen, no butting in, okay?

07:45.142 --> 07:46.208
I mean it.

07:46.238 --> 07:47.565
You have my word, sir.

07:47.595 --> 07:49.061
May the force be with you.

07:51.733 --> 07:52.733
Oh!

07:55.036 --> 07:58.738
♪ Come smell the fruit ♪

07:58.740 --> 08:02.575
♪ for a while ♪

08:04.852 --> 08:06.295
Is he as hot as I think he is?

08:06.297 --> 08:09.230
I saw him first. Whew.

08:11.312 --> 08:13.218
- Mmm!
- Stop flinching.

08:13.248 --> 08:14.983
It's a normal human reaction to have

08:15.013 --> 08:17.534
when someone comes at your
eye with a tiny guillotine.

08:18.190 --> 08:19.246
It's a curler.

08:19.276 --> 08:21.037
Okay.

08:22.841 --> 08:25.472
Can I ask you something?

08:26.026 --> 08:28.511
Yes, if you die tomorrow, I would cry.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.018
I think a lot of people would.

08:30.048 --> 08:31.845
No, not that.

08:33.751 --> 08:37.169
I was surprised that you
were so into that guy.

08:37.994 --> 08:40.389
I thought you took them off your menu.

08:40.991 --> 08:42.441
I never said that.

08:43.043 --> 08:46.862
I guess I just assumed that 
since you fell for me

08:47.107 --> 08:49.982
that that meant you were a lesbian.

08:50.869 --> 08:53.117
Sometimes, my body reacts to guys,

08:53.147 --> 08:55.755
even though my brain doesn't want it to.

08:55.757 --> 08:59.476
It's like I'm a sexual hulk.

09:00.428 --> 09:03.546
So you can see yourself
having sex with a guy?

09:06.601 --> 09:08.301
One step at a time.

09:08.768 --> 09:11.108
We're just talking about a
high school carnival here.

09:12.561 --> 09:15.625
Well, I think that this is great news.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.094
You just doubled your chances
of falling in love tonight.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.434
Karma...

09:19.464 --> 09:20.963
I know. I'm getting carried away.

09:21.327 --> 09:25.001
I promise to stop if you
promise to stop flinching.

09:30.258 --> 09:31.674
Welcome to America.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.232
We hope you enjoy your
visit but not too much.

09:34.262 --> 09:35.511
You can't stay.

09:35.513 --> 09:37.602
I feel weird implying
I'm native American.

09:37.632 --> 09:38.881
This gown is hot.

09:38.883 --> 09:40.302
My thighs are chafing.

09:40.332 --> 09:43.516
Ugh! Go man the dunk tank.

09:43.972 --> 09:45.338
What are you doing?

09:45.340 --> 09:46.506
You asked for a carnival,

09:46.508 --> 09:47.840
and I delivered in a big way.

09:47.842 --> 09:49.342
Carnaval!

09:49.344 --> 09:51.740
The Brazilian festival
marking the beginning of lent.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.546
Well, you should have been more specific.

09:53.548 --> 09:55.681
Lauren, you are showing
them the worst of America...

09:55.683 --> 09:57.633
Snow cones made with
high-fructose corn syrup,

09:57.635 --> 10:00.019
a game that glamorizes
the slaughter of ducks,

10:00.021 --> 10:01.554
and I saw a guy

10:01.556 --> 10:03.662
guessing a girl's weight for prizes.

10:03.692 --> 10:07.332
Excuse me, ladies, I just 
happened to overhear.

10:07.802 --> 10:09.450
Penelope, you're not suggesting

10:09.480 --> 10:11.769
we censor what parts of our
country these Brazilians see?

10:11.799 --> 10:13.215
What? No! I was just...

10:13.217 --> 10:15.267
Because the last time I checked, 
this was America,

10:15.269 --> 10:16.085
not China.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.303
Stop twisting my words.

10:17.305 --> 10:19.277
What I meant was...

10:20.393 --> 10:22.017
Never mind.

10:23.729 --> 10:24.916
That was impressive.

10:24.946 --> 10:26.395
It looked like you needed a hand.

10:26.397 --> 10:27.563
I didn't.

10:27.565 --> 10:29.115
But if you really want to help,

10:29.117 --> 10:31.650
I could use someone to man 
the bottle toss booth.

10:31.652 --> 10:33.452
Don't worry, Daisy Duke,

10:33.454 --> 10:35.821
I got it covered.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.811
The weather is really nice tonight.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.313
It's that perfect temperature

10:48.343 --> 10:50.074
where you can wear a light jacket

10:50.104 --> 10:52.054
without getting pit stains.

10:52.656 --> 10:54.182
I am not translating that

10:54.481 --> 10:55.691
for your own good.

10:55.693 --> 10:57.476
You're trying to connect with her,

10:57.478 --> 10:58.861
not sedate her for surgery.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.312
Try getting to know her.

11:00.548 --> 11:02.553
Ask her what she wants
to be when she grows up.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.258
She said that she wants to be

11:12.260 --> 11:13.809
a filmmaker whose documentaries

11:13.811 --> 11:15.400
change the way people see the world.

11:15.430 --> 11:16.979
Really? She said all that?

11:16.981 --> 11:18.231
Yep, Portuguese.

11:18.233 --> 11:20.850
So much said with such few words.

11:21.711 --> 11:25.271
Tell her how much I love documentaries.

11:25.594 --> 11:28.039
_

11:28.586 --> 11:29.575
Next! Step right up.

11:29.577 --> 11:32.111
Knock 'em down, and win
your sweetheart a prize.

11:32.113 --> 11:34.664
♪ Hey, wait a minute, just a minute ♪

11:34.666 --> 11:36.415
- ♪ I was ready for the flight ♪
- Aw.

11:36.417 --> 11:37.583
♪ Got my bags packed ♪

11:37.585 --> 11:39.438
♪ waiting on the driver ♪

11:39.468 --> 11:40.787
Let me help.

11:46.661 --> 11:47.565
What'd she say?

11:47.595 --> 11:48.811
I don't speak Portuguese,

11:48.813 --> 11:51.264
but I think she said, "butt out!"

11:51.266 --> 11:52.515
I got carried away. I'm sorry.

11:52.517 --> 11:53.938
I promise it won't happen again.

11:53.968 --> 11:55.668
It better not, C-3PO,

11:55.670 --> 11:58.826
or I'm gonna take you apart
and sell you for scrap metal.

11:59.395 --> 12:00.364
Uh...

12:02.410 --> 12:03.815
Huge favor to ask.

12:03.845 --> 12:06.266
I'm trying to spend the
weekend in San Francisco,

12:06.296 --> 12:07.301
if you know what I mean,

12:07.331 --> 12:09.254
but he has this real grenade of a cousin,

12:09.284 --> 12:11.426
and you know Brazilians
and their cousins.

12:11.456 --> 12:13.619
No. Is that a thing?

12:13.972 --> 12:15.296
Huge.

12:15.326 --> 12:17.264
Please take her off my
hands for a little bit.

12:17.623 --> 12:20.765
I promise, she's no Gisele, so
there's seriously zero chance

12:20.795 --> 12:22.461
you'll be bundchening in your pants.

12:22.919 --> 12:25.603
Pretty, pretty please?

12:25.933 --> 12:28.100
Fine. I'll do it.

12:28.102 --> 12:29.323
Ah! You're the bestest.

12:29.353 --> 12:31.398
Raquel!

12:33.391 --> 12:35.224
You said she was a grenade.

12:35.226 --> 12:36.692
I can hardly look at her.

12:36.694 --> 12:38.811
Owe you one.

12:47.738 --> 12:50.289
His family owns a small bakery in Rio,

12:50.291 --> 12:52.458
and he says you smell
better than the shop

12:52.460 --> 12:54.100
on a Sunday morning.

12:54.130 --> 12:55.044
No, he didn't.

12:55.046 --> 12:56.885
You pulled that from one
of your stupid movies.

12:56.915 --> 13:00.555
No, I didn't. It's
word for word, I swear.

13:01.508 --> 13:02.702
Tell him thank you,

13:03.173 --> 13:05.454
and he smells really nice too.

13:09.971 --> 13:11.527
Uh...

13:13.971 --> 13:15.320
_

13:15.350 --> 13:17.516
He wants to take you on the Ferris wheel.

13:18.177 --> 13:19.869
_

13:19.899 --> 13:22.476
_

13:22.801 --> 13:24.307
What's going on? He seems upset.

13:31.901 --> 13:33.399
What's wrong with you?

13:33.701 --> 13:36.819
Your scheming sent poor
Manolo to the hospital!

13:36.849 --> 13:39.271
I was just trying to set a romantic mood.

13:39.273 --> 13:41.329
Remember that scene at the
end of Never Been Kissed?

13:41.359 --> 13:43.559
Oh! My life is not a movie!

13:43.561 --> 13:44.894
You are not the director,

13:44.896 --> 13:47.471
and you can't press fast-forward!

13:59.548 --> 14:00.590
Yum.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.300
I'm sorry, but I don't
understand what you're saying.

14:07.602 --> 14:10.092
She said you have lips like 
pink, pillowy clouds.

14:10.122 --> 14:12.794
Um...This is not what it looks like.

14:12.824 --> 14:14.529
I'm just doing a favor to Shane.

14:14.559 --> 14:15.630
He's hooking up with her cousin.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.627
You know Brazilians and their cousins.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.862
It's okay.

14:18.864 --> 14:19.777
No need to explain.

14:19.807 --> 14:22.532
I'm... I'm glad you're moving on.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.771
Karma, there you are!

14:27.773 --> 14:29.194
You know, luren's looking for someone

14:29.224 --> 14:31.925
full of hot air to help
blow up some balloons.

14:35.290 --> 14:37.403
Enjoy the rest of your date.

14:37.948 --> 14:40.000
As you were.

14:50.562 --> 14:52.245
Oh, look, you're back.

14:52.275 --> 14:53.485
Hmm.

14:54.128 --> 14:55.437
Yeah.

14:55.467 --> 14:58.468
That happened while you were away.

15:01.055 --> 15:03.039
I fell in love with my best friend,

15:03.069 --> 15:05.158
and I finally got the guts to tell her,

15:05.160 --> 15:08.495
and everything got weird.

15:08.497 --> 15:11.003
And now she can't wait for me 
to fall for someone else,

15:11.033 --> 15:14.256
but every time I look at her...

15:14.286 --> 15:17.970
My stomach gets these fluttery,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.393
"I think I'm gonna barf" feelings.

15:21.938 --> 15:23.765
And as much as I want them to go away,

15:23.795 --> 15:26.129
I kind of don't, you know?

15:28.517 --> 15:29.725
Yeah.

15:31.058 --> 15:33.242
I'm a human sinkhole.

15:33.272 --> 15:35.727
Stand back.

15:36.051 --> 15:40.110
We... Kiss... Now?

15:42.414 --> 15:43.964
Ugh! This is a school fair, people,

15:44.266 --> 15:46.016
not a third-world red light district!

15:48.053 --> 15:49.269
Pooh!

15:49.551 --> 15:52.806
I really wanted that stuffed banana.

15:54.192 --> 15:56.309
We have a winner.

15:58.762 --> 16:00.352
What the are you doing?

16:00.382 --> 16:01.848
Um, volunteering

16:01.850 --> 16:03.016
out of the kindness of my heart.

16:03.018 --> 16:04.790
- You're welcome.
- We're not socialists.

16:04.820 --> 16:06.342
We don't give away
prizes just for playing!

16:06.372 --> 16:07.454
Give me that back, Brandi!

16:07.456 --> 16:08.927
No, this is my prize!

16:08.957 --> 16:10.457
For what, being the school slut?

16:10.796 --> 16:11.788
Ugh!

16:13.295 --> 16:14.716
Now it's your prize

16:14.746 --> 16:17.539
for being the school's biggest bitch!

16:19.000 --> 16:20.500
- Ouch.
- What?

16:20.502 --> 16:21.907
I know they all feel that way about me

16:21.937 --> 16:23.687
just because I don't want to hold hands

16:23.689 --> 16:24.821
and sing We Are The World.

16:24.823 --> 16:25.939
Yeah, that's weird.

16:26.141 --> 16:27.691
Like, once a month, maybe,

16:27.943 --> 16:29.448
but every day in homeroom, ugh.

16:29.478 --> 16:30.860
Just you wait. That's just the tip

16:30.862 --> 16:31.878
of the melting iceberg.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.481
I'll admit, compared
to my old high school,

16:34.833 --> 16:36.491
this place is stranger than
my cousin's inverted nipple.

16:36.521 --> 16:37.973
Right? Thank you!

16:38.003 --> 16:39.269
But it's also kind of awesome.

16:39.271 --> 16:41.277
Oh, crap, you drank the kool-aid.

16:41.307 --> 16:42.978
Come on! There's no bullying,

16:43.008 --> 16:44.758
no silly cliques, no sodas
in the vending machine.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.426
Those are just empty calories.

16:46.428 --> 16:49.451
Look, I'm not saying you
have to start wearing leather.

16:49.481 --> 16:50.781
Just loosen up a bit.

16:50.783 --> 16:51.949
Are you calling me uptight?

16:51.951 --> 16:53.116
Just look around.

16:53.418 --> 16:56.620
Everyone's having a
great time except you,

16:56.622 --> 16:59.256
and I bet you're even
prettier when you smile.

17:01.169 --> 17:02.212
See?

17:03.311 --> 17:04.532
I was right.

17:27.085 --> 17:29.823
What do you think
you're doing, Nancy Drew?

17:30.484 --> 17:32.843
I'm helping Amy move on.

17:32.873 --> 17:34.641
So you can be with Liam?

17:34.671 --> 17:35.781
What? No!

17:35.811 --> 17:36.896
It's not about that.

17:36.926 --> 17:39.645
I-I want her to be happy.

17:39.675 --> 17:41.198
And why are you so angry at me?

17:41.200 --> 17:42.354
What did I ever do to you?

17:42.384 --> 17:45.207
You pretended you were
a lesbian to be popular.

17:45.237 --> 17:47.821
On behalf of my people,
we find that off-putting.

17:48.399 --> 17:49.940
You were the one who outed me.

17:49.970 --> 17:52.973
You could have corrected me, 
but you didn't.

17:53.003 --> 17:54.528
You used your witchy ways

17:54.530 --> 17:56.863
and made my two favorite
people fall for you.

17:57.359 --> 18:00.417
And I have no clue how you did it.

18:08.571 --> 18:10.896
Nope, still don't get it.

18:14.630 --> 18:16.492
How happy would you be 
if I started singing

18:16.494 --> 18:19.021
you're the one that I want right now?

18:19.664 --> 18:20.863
Where's Fabiana?

18:21.371 --> 18:23.760
I saw you two speaking
the universal tongue.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.991
She's a really good kisser,

18:27.021 --> 18:28.009
but when I touched her,

18:28.039 --> 18:29.740
she turned me into an oompa loompa.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.816
I'm sorry.

18:34.846 --> 18:36.934
I pushed you to move on too fast.

18:36.964 --> 18:37.734
I just really want...

18:37.764 --> 18:39.654
Me to fall in love with someone else.

18:39.684 --> 18:40.767
I know, I get it.

18:40.797 --> 18:44.604
I never expected the way that I love you

18:44.606 --> 18:48.246
would somehow not be enough.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.610
You deserve someone who makes you happy.

18:52.053 --> 18:53.966
You make me happy.

18:53.996 --> 18:55.315
You know what I mean.

18:56.568 --> 18:57.969
I do.

18:58.946 --> 19:01.871
And I promise I will move on,

19:02.132 --> 19:06.171
but it just might take a while.

19:06.201 --> 19:07.944
♪ What's on your mind ♪

19:07.946 --> 19:10.068
What do we do until then?

19:13.084 --> 19:15.702
Don't let us off until
her face turns green.

19:15.704 --> 19:17.620
It's just a ride. It's just a ride!

19:17.622 --> 19:19.205
That they built today!

19:24.537 --> 19:25.845
Aah!

19:25.847 --> 19:28.381
I'll be sad when the Brazilians leave.

19:28.383 --> 19:31.322
They've taught me so much
about avoiding tan lines

19:31.352 --> 19:33.402
and getting the perfect calves.

19:33.887 --> 19:35.021
Where's Raquel? Looks like

19:35.023 --> 19:38.196
you two were having some
serious international relations.

19:38.226 --> 19:39.509
I sent her home.

19:39.965 --> 19:41.956
You know, this may come as a shock,

19:42.537 --> 19:44.514
but I'm not ready to move on from Karma.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.683
What? No!

19:47.208 --> 19:49.091
If you're so smitten,
then go be with her.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.809
She's clearly still into you.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.194
Just go forgive her for lying

19:53.224 --> 19:55.116
and live happily ever after.

19:55.146 --> 19:56.365
I did forgive her.

19:56.395 --> 19:57.811
That's not what's standing in the way.

19:58.563 --> 20:00.813
So what is?

20:00.815 --> 20:01.815
Um...

20:04.986 --> 20:06.424
After you told me the truth,

20:06.454 --> 20:08.678
I got really drunk, and I slept with...

20:08.708 --> 20:10.790
Oh, wait, let me guess. Brandi.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.052
Soleil?

20:12.082 --> 20:14.743
That girl from homeroom?

20:15.600 --> 20:17.113
Amy.

20:18.096 --> 20:19.685
- Oh, my God.
