-[birds chirping]
-[siren wailing in distance]

00:36.875 --> 00:37.875
[Ryan] Ready, sir?

00:41.666 --> 00:42.750
[hums in affirmation]

00:45.375 --> 00:48.250
[aircraft droning]

00:49.375 --> 00:51.875
[indistinct chatter]

00:56.125 --> 00:57.625
[aide 1] I'll cover the press pool.

00:57.708 --> 01:00.041
-[aide 2] I got the dignitaries.
-All right, sounds good.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.750
You see anything off, you call it out.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.625
-[phone vibrates, beeps]
-Back in a sec.

01:03.708 --> 01:04.666
Yeah?

01:06.041 --> 01:07.875
Holy shit. I…

01:08.875 --> 01:10.500
Where are you? I thought you were dead.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.708
No, no, hold on, hold on.
Slow down, slow down.

01:13.666 --> 01:15.500
Do you think he'll believe me?

01:15.583 --> 01:18.000
-No, no. Of course, I trust you. Wait, Le…
-[line disconnects]

01:18.083 --> 01:20.083

01:20.166 --> 01:21.625
-Goddamn it.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.000
[Patrick exhales]

01:32.875 --> 01:34.458
[groans]

01:39.875 --> 01:41.083
Good morning.

01:44.958 --> 01:46.625
Wilson.

01:46.708 --> 01:49.083
[Wilson] Sorry for the restraints,
Ms. Redfield,

01:49.166 --> 01:51.166
-but I need your full attention.
-[groans]

01:51.250 --> 01:54.541
The signing ceremony with Penamstan
is taking place above us soon,

01:54.625 --> 01:57.291
-and I'm expected so I'll make this brief.
-[Claire grunts]

01:57.375 --> 02:02.000
[Wilson] Now, this file I have says
you're a survivor of Raccoon City.

02:02.583 --> 02:03.666
[grunts]

02:03.750 --> 02:05.208
These days, your job

02:05.291 --> 02:10.125
is to "acquire aid to build schools
and hospitals in Penamstan."

02:10.208 --> 02:12.500
Helping the unfortunate. How noble.

02:13.541 --> 02:14.791
What do you want?

02:14.875 --> 02:16.666
How about we make a deal?

02:16.750 --> 02:20.666
Drop your investigation,
and I'll build you anything you want.

02:21.291 --> 02:24.875
Schools, hospitals, anything.

02:25.791 --> 02:27.625
[Wilson] You've worked so hard
for those people.

02:27.708 --> 02:29.958
Wouldn't you like to see them
get what they deserve?

02:30.041 --> 02:31.041
Oh!

02:31.750 --> 02:33.166
And I'll also let you live.

02:33.958 --> 02:36.708
[scoffs] You don't play fair.

02:36.791 --> 02:39.291
I just want to nurture hope
for the future.

02:39.958 --> 02:41.583
Oh, "nurture hope," huh?

02:42.375 --> 02:44.000
And what kind of future is that?

02:44.083 --> 02:46.833
One where you do whatever you want,
to whoever you want?

02:46.916 --> 02:49.000
[scoffs] Sounds more like hell.

02:49.083 --> 02:52.333
I'm not sure what you saw in those notes,
but it can hardly be considered evidence.

02:52.416 --> 02:55.708
The man who wrote it had PTSD, after all.

02:55.791 --> 03:00.083
He was probably self-medicating.
But let's back up a second.

03:00.166 --> 03:03.250
You're a smart woman. Experienced.

03:03.333 --> 03:07.791
You know that if, say, we wanted
something or someone to disappear,

03:07.875 --> 03:10.833
it would damn well disappear.
It's not hard to do.

03:11.416 --> 03:15.083
The President is going to take
a firm stance against China today.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.083
[Wilson] And then, our military
will occupy Penamstan.

03:20.916 --> 03:23.458
We will deploy our bioweapons there.

03:23.541 --> 03:26.916
And once Penamstan,
a country that has known only conflict,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.833
incorporates them into their military,

03:28.916 --> 03:31.583
it will open the market for the inhibitor.

03:32.541 --> 03:36.083
It's a drug I've developed
that keeps the bioweapons in check.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.500
[Claire] I'm sorry, "market"?

03:38.583 --> 03:40.625
You're making bioweapons for profit.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.875
[Wilson] We can make soldiers
who never die.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.750
As long as they take regular doses
of the inhibitor,

03:46.833 --> 03:49.833
they can fight longer
and harder than ever before.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.833
It's revolutionary, don't you think?

03:52.916 --> 03:55.083
[Claire] You'd do that
to people for money.

03:55.791 --> 03:57.375
What kind of monster are you?

03:58.666 --> 04:01.916
No, I take it back.
You're just fucking nuts.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.375
-Shut up.
-[folder flaps]

04:03.458 --> 04:05.083
[folder thuds]

04:05.166 --> 04:08.041
While you've been busy playing saint,

04:08.125 --> 04:12.041
I've been working for the sake
of our nation's security.

04:12.125 --> 04:16.000
[Wilson] If it means sacrificing
a few soldiers, so be it.

04:16.583 --> 04:20.250
And what's wrong with profiting
off the fruits of one's labor?

04:20.333 --> 04:21.875
-Nothing.
-[thwacks]

04:22.833 --> 04:27.250
[Wilson] I don't need to convince you.
I can just have you infected.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.666
Once the virus takes hold,
the inhibitor is the only relief.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.291
That's one way to get you on my team.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.416
[light chuckle]

04:34.500 --> 04:36.583
[man] Secretary Wilson.

04:37.333 --> 04:40.000
Doing your own dirty work for a change?

04:40.083 --> 04:41.958
[dramatic music]

04:42.541 --> 04:43.625
You.

04:44.541 --> 04:46.125
[Wilson] Jason.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.250
This is a surprise.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.000

-[elevator clonks]

05:54.416 --> 05:57.625
[Shen May] Jason said Wilson
has a fully equipped lab down here.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.458
It's where he develops his bioweapons.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.083
Right under everyone's noses. Typical.

06:06.916 --> 06:08.833
[Wilson] Nice work, Major.

06:08.916 --> 06:13.333
Now that you're officially dead,
you'll be more effective on covert ops.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.583
[Jason] I've been as good as dead
the last six years, sir.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.083
You killed me.

-[thumps]

06:24.666 --> 06:26.250
[squeaking]

06:26.333 --> 06:28.416
Bastard. What are you doing?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.666
I'm here to punch my ticket for good.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.916
[Wilson pained groans]

06:34.125 --> 06:35.666
You need this.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.375
[panicked breathing]

06:39.666 --> 06:41.041
You'll turn without it.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.125
[inhibitors clatter]

06:42.208 --> 06:44.458
[Wilson] I'm the only one who can help.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.250
You need it!

06:46.333 --> 06:48.416
-[Jason] Not anymore.

[pained groaning continues]

08:31.208 --> 08:32.875
[gasps]

08:33.791 --> 08:35.416
I'm gonna end this.

08:36.666 --> 08:39.791
I'm gonna go up there
and show myself to them.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.250
To the world.

08:41.958 --> 08:46.541
And then, this, this torture chamber…

08:47.750 --> 08:51.166
Everything, it's all gonna burn.

08:51.250 --> 08:55.833
No. I have my brother's chip.
All the evidence we need is right here.

08:56.458 --> 09:00.375
All we have to do is go public
with it, like we planned.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.833
You don't have to do this.

09:03.416 --> 09:05.750
[Jason] That won't help anything.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.875
It won't change what this country's done,
or what it's doing right now.

09:09.958 --> 09:11.500
You know that.

09:11.583 --> 09:12.750
[camera shutters clicking]

09:14.625 --> 09:17.791
I will show you fear.

09:50.416 --> 09:51.458
[Leon] Jason, stop!

09:55.208 --> 09:58.416
I will show everyone what fear is.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.875
Then, then it will spread.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.375
That won't change anything.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.500
I will open their eyes to true terror.

10:05.583 --> 10:10.041
It's the only way to keep this tragedy
from ever happening again.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.708
No! It doesn't work that way.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.833
I won't let you die like this.

12:10.750 --> 12:11.666
You okay?

12:12.250 --> 12:13.083
Yeah.

Mr. President, what are…

-Do you have time for a comment?
-[reporter 3] Mr. President, over here.

12:29.708 --> 12:30.625
It's time, sir.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.750
[reporter 4] Mr. President,
a second of your time.

-[deep sigh]

12:49.250 --> 12:50.375
Mr. President.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.208
[in soft voice] China's not behind this.

12:54.791 --> 12:57.666
The hacking, the virus attack,
the submarine disappearing.

12:57.750 --> 12:58.583
It's all Wilson.

12:58.666 --> 13:01.125
Wilson's trying to provoke
a war with China.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.166
Where did you get this information?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.666
Leon, sir.

13:09.333 --> 13:12.458
[applause]

13:15.541 --> 13:18.458
[crowd cheering]

13:36.291 --> 13:38.291
We must be the source of hope

13:38.375 --> 13:42.416
to those who seek freedom
and salvation from terror.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.541
And we cannot allow anyone
to interfere with Penamstan

13:45.625 --> 13:47.666
as they rebuild their homes and lives

13:47.750 --> 13:51.250
and pursue what so many of us
in this country take for granted.

13:52.125 --> 13:55.458
The citizens there have chosen
to overcome their hardships

13:55.541 --> 13:56.791
and walk a new path.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.750
And we will be there to guide them.

14:02.583 --> 14:05.875
For our new friends, for their future,

14:05.958 --> 14:08.666
and for the future of their children,

14:08.750 --> 14:13.250
we will do everything in our power
to create peace and prosperity

14:13.333 --> 14:14.375
for them.

15:03.833 --> 15:04.916
[Claire] Okay.

15:06.833 --> 15:08.083
All right.

17:34.958 --> 17:37.208
[Jason] Why are you trying to stop me?

17:38.041 --> 17:40.666
Duty? Revenge?

17:56.666 --> 17:58.208
-[body thuds]

Then it will spread.

[groans]

18:11.833 --> 18:14.791
…then this world will know…

18:15.250 --> 18:16.291
terror.

[Graham] And I also promise to those ruled
by greed and who threaten peace,

19:11.375 --> 19:13.666
you will not be welcome there.

19:14.750 --> 19:18.958
The United States of America
will stand at the forefront of peace

19:19.041 --> 19:20.875
and stability in the world,

19:21.583 --> 19:23.666

You are a witness…

20:30.625 --> 20:31.833
to this…

20:33.208 --> 20:34.666
fear.

20:38.666 --> 20:43.666
[Jason] And now, you…
you will help it spread.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.125
[Patrick] Leon.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.208
Hey, I don't know how
you survived a sub blowing up

21:35.291 --> 21:37.541
and whatever happened downstairs,

21:37.625 --> 21:41.208
but holy shit, man.
That's some hero-level stuff.

21:41.291 --> 21:42.750
No, I was just lucky.

21:42.833 --> 21:46.041
Oh, come on.
You saved everyone's lives here.

21:46.125 --> 21:49.166
Plus, you helped the President
decide the course

21:49.250 --> 21:51.958
this country's gonna take
for years to come.

21:52.791 --> 21:56.166
[Patrick] Nah. You're definitely a hero.

23:16.625 --> 23:17.500
Hey.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.291
[Leon] How's the arm?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.208
[Claire] Better.

23:21.875 --> 23:24.000
I had to sneak out
of the hospital, though.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.041
Had to break the window.
Climb down some bedsheets.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.000
I thought I told you
not to do anything stupid.

23:31.083 --> 23:34.625
Uh, hello. I'm joking. [chuckles]

23:34.708 --> 23:36.958
When are you going to stop
treating me like a kid?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.291
Probably never.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.083
[deep inhale] Anyways…

23:43.458 --> 23:44.416
about the chip.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.875
Do you have it?

23:49.125 --> 23:51.375
I thought you called
'cause you wanted to grab dinner.

23:54.958 --> 23:58.875
[Claire] I wanna make a copy of it
and give it to all the newspapers.

24:00.791 --> 24:03.083
This thing's gonna blow up, big time.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.375
I can't.

24:13.375 --> 24:14.208
What?

24:14.958 --> 24:16.958
[exhales]

24:22.083 --> 24:23.500
So that's how it's gonna be.

24:25.541 --> 24:27.750
You do things your way,
and I do things mine?

24:29.458 --> 24:32.666
[gentle music]

24:36.541 --> 24:37.458
Okay.

24:40.666 --> 24:41.500
Fine.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.041
[scoffs]

24:55.708 --> 24:56.833
Like I said before…

24:59.333 --> 25:00.875
that outfit doesn't suit you.

25:11.541 --> 25:12.875
[Leon] I'll stop this.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.916

25:19.166 --> 25:20.166
[exhales]
