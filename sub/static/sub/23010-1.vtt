00:18.728 --> 00:22.929
(Suspenseful,
mysterious theme playing)

03:02.119 --> 03:04.753
Is it much further?
A few miles.

03:04.820 --> 03:06.020
Do you have
enough gas?

03:06.087 --> 03:08.721
Heh, I got plenty.

03:22.759 --> 03:23.894
(Sighs)

03:23.760 --> 03:24.960
All this ocean and sand,

03:25.027 --> 03:26.595
I feel as
if I were in another world.

03:26.661 --> 03:28.996
Oh, you won't mind it.
Wait and see.

03:29.062 --> 03:30.662
Look, men,
we gotta stick together.

03:30.729 --> 03:33.263
Tell you mother it's going to be
swell living at the ocean.

03:33.397 --> 03:34.999
Sure, Mom.
Dad's gonna buy me some flippers

03:35.065 --> 03:36.499
And I'll let you wear them.

03:36.565 --> 03:38.100
(Chuckles)

03:39.400 --> 03:41.934
(Mysterious theme playing)

03:43.035 --> 03:45.569
(Machine humming)

03:53.773 --> 03:54.907
Hey, Mom, listen.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.041
Listen to what?

03:57.108 --> 03:58.908
Dad, don't you hear it?
Hear what, son?

03:58.974 --> 04:01.309
(Suspenseful,
mysterious theme playing)

04:10.713 --> 04:12.680
(Engine sputters)

04:16.416 --> 04:18.082
What in the world?
I warned you.

04:18.149 --> 04:20.683
Honey, I got more than
half a tank left!

04:20.750 --> 04:22.884
The electrical system
isn't working.

04:22.951 --> 04:24.184
Dad, listen.

04:24.251 --> 04:25.419
Not now.
I gotta figure this out.

04:25.485 --> 04:26.819
There's something
wrong here.

04:26.885 --> 04:28.853
Mom, look up there.
Yes, dear.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.287
(Engine revs)

04:30.421 --> 04:31.622
That's funny.
I don't understand.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.856
It's working now.
But Dad, up there!

04:33.923 --> 04:35.156
(Airplane whirring)

04:35.223 --> 04:37.924
It's just a jet, Bud.
It's not.

04:37.990 --> 04:40.425
It wasn't a jet!
It wasn't anything like a jet!

04:40.425 --> 04:43.426
Children,
will you stop chattering?

05:00.566 --> 05:02.800
Dave Brewster,
Oakland Electronic Company,

05:02.867 --> 05:06.568
San Francisco. I'm assigned to
Colonel Manley.

05:08.469 --> 05:11.604
Brewster, Dave,
family of three.

05:14.072 --> 05:15.840
Is this the last
of the bunch?

05:15.906 --> 05:18.041
Yes, that's all.

05:18.107 --> 05:21.508
Here, let them through.

05:21.575 --> 05:24.076
Okay, go ahead.
Oh, where is Unit 3?

05:24.143 --> 05:26.143
- We're gonna live there.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:26.209 --> 05:27.410
Keep going
right over the rise.

05:27.477 --> 05:28.644
You'll find Unit 3
on your left.

05:28.744 --> 05:30.446
Thanks.
Thank you.

05:37.013 --> 05:39.948
(Children chattering)

05:56.587 --> 05:59.220
Well, this is it, honey.

05:59.287 --> 06:00.621
Try to make
the best of it.

06:00.755 --> 06:01.621
Yes.

06:01.755 --> 06:03.756
Come on, kids,
let's get out.

06:08.257 --> 06:09.859
Well, I put away
most of the clothes.

06:09.925 --> 06:11.825
There's good closet space
anyhow.

06:11.892 --> 06:13.525
It's not so bad.

06:13.592 --> 06:16.360
Sure, if you like
living on the beach.

06:16.426 --> 06:18.061
It's only temporary,
honey.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.095
Doesn't matter.
The sand's going to drift in

06:20.162 --> 06:22.028
And ruin everything anyhow.

06:22.095 --> 06:23.562
Look, honey,

06:23.628 --> 06:25.796
I've driven over
500 miles today.

06:25.863 --> 06:29.265
Tomorrow I start a new job,
an important job.

06:29.331 --> 06:31.366
I'm a little tired
myself.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.867
Of course. I'm sorry.

06:34.933 --> 06:38.533
I guess I'm just homesick
for San Francisco.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.535
Well, where is it?

06:44.602 --> 06:46.803
The launching platform.

06:46.870 --> 06:47.804
Is it on the beach?

06:47.871 --> 06:51.038
Probably somewhere
on the beach.

06:51.105 --> 06:52.372
When's the first test?

06:52.438 --> 06:55.139
I don't know.
Soon. Maybe this week.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.907
Will it work?

06:58.374 --> 06:59.875
It's got to.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.640
It's gotta do a job
better than theirs

07:01.775 --> 07:02.841
So if they start anything...

07:02.908 --> 07:05.042
Dave, what you said
about its accuracy?

07:05.109 --> 07:06.342
We just got in, honey.

07:06.409 --> 07:07.944
I don't know any answers.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.545
But you, your company.
You worked on it for months.

07:10.612 --> 07:13.912
I worked on one part
out of 35,000 parts.

07:13.979 --> 07:15.412
It's much more
complicated

07:15.479 --> 07:18.947
Than just
an intercontinental missile.

07:19.014 --> 07:21.548
Is ours the only one?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.882
We don't think so.

07:25.782 --> 07:27.884
It's almost funny,
isn't it?

07:27.950 --> 07:30.785
I mean, the children living
in the middle of all this.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.652
Would you have wanted me
to say no

07:32.786 --> 07:35.487
When the company insisted
I come here?

07:35.553 --> 07:38.887
Of course not.
I'm just tired.

07:38.953 --> 07:40.687
Let's go out
and find Bud and Ken.

07:40.787 --> 07:43.789
Okay. I could use some air.

07:48.691 --> 07:50.591
Just wait until this project's
a few weeks old.

07:50.657 --> 07:52.124
You won't recognize
the place.

07:52.192 --> 07:54.325
A little grass,
it'll be like a vacation spot.

07:54.392 --> 07:56.593
It's just the bleakness
of it at first.

07:56.659 --> 07:58.494
It's your fault
for marrying a city girl.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.394
(Chuckles)

08:05.929 --> 08:08.297
I wish the children
hadn't wandered off.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.298
You think it's dangerous
down there on the rocks?

08:10.364 --> 08:14.099
No. Besides, you know
how the boys love the beach.

08:14.165 --> 08:16.665
The ocean, rocks,
everything makes me feel

08:16.799 --> 08:18.200
So unimportant myself.

08:18.266 --> 08:21.801
Well, you'll like it here.
Wait till you meet the others.

08:21.867 --> 08:24.603
I guess we'd better get back
and straighten things out.

08:27.404 --> 08:28.804
JAMES:
Mr. Brewster?

08:28.804 --> 08:30.904
Hi.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.438
I'm Mr. James, Security Officer
for the Command.

08:33.505 --> 08:35.506
I just heard from the gate
you'd arrived.

08:35.572 --> 08:37.140
This is my wife.
How do you do?

08:37.207 --> 08:39.273
I hope you'll be comfortable
here, Mrs. Brewster.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.807
Thank you.
I'm glad I caught you.

08:40.807 --> 08:41.972
I hope it won't be
inconvenient,

08:42.039 --> 08:43.541
But you're
the last member to arrive

08:43.607 --> 08:44.909
And the Colonel's giving
a briefing

08:44.975 --> 08:46.410
And I think
he'd like you to attend.

08:46.476 --> 08:48.076
If you don't mind,
Mrs. Brewster.

08:48.143 --> 08:50.311
No, of course not. You'll come
back as soon as you can?

08:50.377 --> 08:52.312
Sure, I will.

09:05.449 --> 09:07.016
FRIEDA:
Hello.

09:07.082 --> 09:09.483
I'm Frieda Johnson.
I live in the next trailer.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.284
Oh, I'm Anne Brewster.
How do you do?

09:12.351 --> 09:14.085
We just arrived.

09:14.152 --> 09:16.820
Everything certainly is strange
and different here.

09:16.820 --> 09:18.119
I know just how you feel.

09:18.185 --> 09:19.820
I thought I'd die
the first few weeks

09:19.820 --> 09:21.854
Away from my folks
and friends.

09:21.921 --> 09:24.188
It's the feeling
of living so close

09:24.255 --> 09:25.689
To the end of the world,
maybe.

09:25.823 --> 09:27.990
After a while
you don't think of it like that.

09:28.057 --> 09:29.657
Do you have any children?
Mm-hm.

09:29.724 --> 09:32.157
Two boys.
They're on the beach somewhere.

09:32.224 --> 09:34.625
How old are they?
12 and 10.

09:34.691 --> 09:37.059
Oh, that'll be great
for Eadie. She's 11.

09:37.126 --> 09:39.927
Well, I'd better
get my laundry on the line.

09:39.993 --> 09:41.828
Oh, by the way,
we're having a weenie roast

09:41.895 --> 09:43.728
Out here tonight.
Why don't you come?

09:43.828 --> 09:45.062
It's really for the kids.

09:45.129 --> 09:47.430
That'll be very nice.
Thank you so much.

09:47.496 --> 09:50.031
Good. Then we'll see you later.
Mm-hm.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.102
Here, catch!
Just a minute.

10:04.169 --> 10:06.036
Come on, run.

10:13.971 --> 10:15.605
Hey, Bud, come here.

10:19.973 --> 10:22.474
Gee, Bud.
I bet it's a real cave.

10:22.541 --> 10:24.342
Yeah.

10:42.848 --> 10:46.115
Gee, do you think
we discovered this cave?

10:46.182 --> 10:47.815
Maybe.

10:47.882 --> 10:52.851
What a day. First that thing
in the sky and now this place.

10:52.917 --> 10:55.485
Are you scared
of what you saw?

10:55.552 --> 10:57.785
You?
No.

10:57.852 --> 10:59.385
Do you think
it'll come back?

10:59.453 --> 11:01.687
I hope so.
So do I.

11:01.754 --> 11:03.655
You bet.
Then we can show it to Dad

11:03.721 --> 11:05.489
And prove
we weren't making things up.

11:05.556 --> 11:08.290
(Explosion)

11:08.357 --> 11:10.389
Kind of spooky, huh?

11:10.456 --> 11:13.857
Yeah. It's awful
dark back there.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.558
Maybe it leads
to another cave.

11:16.624 --> 11:19.060
You better stay here, Ken.

11:28.629 --> 11:31.897
Hi.
You scared me.

11:31.964 --> 11:33.765
Hi.
Hello.

11:33.865 --> 11:35.098
So you found our cave.

11:35.165 --> 11:36.698
We didn't know anyone
knew about it.

11:36.765 --> 11:38.599
We have
secret club meetings here.

11:38.666 --> 11:40.467
My name's Eadie Johnson.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.001
I saw you move in
next door to us.

11:43.068 --> 11:45.335
Who are you?
I'm Bud Brewster.

11:45.402 --> 11:47.402
This is my kid brother, Ken.
Hi.

11:47.469 --> 11:49.669
This is Buster, Tim,

11:49.735 --> 11:51.070
George, and Helen.

11:51.136 --> 11:52.303
ALL:
Hi.

11:52.370 --> 11:53.704
Your father
going to work here?

11:53.771 --> 11:55.871
Yeah. He's what you call
a technician.

11:55.871 --> 11:59.407
He knows everything about orbits
and satellites and hydrogen

11:59.474 --> 12:01.473
And missiles and warheads.

12:01.540 --> 12:02.740
So does mine.

12:02.874 --> 12:04.074
Have you seen it yet,
the Thunderer?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.641
It's the biggest one
in the world!

12:05.708 --> 12:07.176
It's a six stage rocket.

12:07.242 --> 12:09.977
It takes a satellite
with a hydrogen warhead

12:10.043 --> 12:13.010
And the satellite will be
hundreds of miles up in the air,

12:13.077 --> 12:15.210
And when it gets above
any city you want

12:15.277 --> 12:18.279
All you gotta do
is press a button and bang.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.613
Wow.
Gee.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.881
Let's show it to them.
Yeah, come on.

12:48.522 --> 12:50.655
(Marching theme playing)

12:54.891 --> 12:56.158
TIM:
There it is.

12:56.225 --> 12:57.893
Wow!
Man!

12:57.959 --> 13:01.127
Isn't it terrific?
Yeah, it sure is.

13:06.395 --> 13:07.628
All right,
beat it, kids.

13:07.695 --> 13:09.029
You know
you don't belong here.

13:09.096 --> 13:10.096
Okay, okay.

13:10.162 --> 13:11.697
I was only showing them
the Thunderer.

13:11.763 --> 13:14.398
Come on, let's move.
All right.

13:17.098 --> 13:19.565
Gentlemen, we've been charged
with a heavy responsibility

13:19.632 --> 13:22.934
In this technological race.

13:23.001 --> 13:26.635
We've all worked long and hard,
and it's paid off

13:26.702 --> 13:28.368
With the development
of the new propellant

13:28.435 --> 13:30.968
And other
extraordinary advances.

13:31.035 --> 13:33.903
We have reason to be
proud of the Thunderer.

13:33.903 --> 13:37.539
Because of this weapon
we're prepared 24 hours a day

13:37.606 --> 13:40.739
To retaliate instantly
in case of enemy attack.

13:40.806 --> 13:42.239
The Thunderer
is no stranger to you.

13:42.306 --> 13:44.507
You've all worked on it
in one way or another.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.341
You all know
what the Thunderer can do,

13:46.408 --> 13:49.575
Send a satellite equipped
with a hydrogen warhead

13:49.642 --> 13:52.243
Into the ocean of space,
where for years,

13:52.310 --> 13:55.277
If you wish, it can circle
on a path known only to us.

13:55.344 --> 13:58.212
A satellite containing
the means to bring retaliation

13:58.278 --> 13:59.713
By the pressing of a button.

14:01.713 --> 14:03.480
TIM:
Here, throw it to me!

14:03.547 --> 14:05.580
KEN:
Catch it.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.949
Hey, look up there!

14:11.016 --> 14:13.651
(Suspenseful,
mysterious theme playing)

14:23.920 --> 14:24.987
Come on!

15:01.433 --> 15:03.700
ALAN:
With pinpoint accuracy...

15:04.934 --> 15:06.601
Let's just wait a minute,
gentlemen.

15:06.668 --> 15:07.835
The lights will be
on in a minute.

15:07.934 --> 15:10.535
Probably a fuse.
Check them, please.

15:28.107 --> 15:29.542
(Machine powering on)

15:29.608 --> 15:31.543
(All chattering)

15:31.609 --> 15:35.810
There. That's better.

15:35.944 --> 15:38.111
Sorry for the interruption,
gentlemen.

15:38.178 --> 15:41.112
It's nice to know
we're no longer in the dark.

15:41.179 --> 15:42.779
(All chuckle)

15:42.847 --> 15:45.947
Getting back to the launching
of the Thunderer...

16:14.957 --> 16:18.824
How's the fishing, Colonel?
Dr. Wahrman.

16:18.958 --> 16:22.560
Any luck?
Ha, ha, not a bite.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.995
Wonderful day.
The sky looks so innocent.

16:30.062 --> 16:32.629
Doctor,
will we succeed tomorrow?

16:32.696 --> 16:34.464
I see no reason
why not.

16:34.530 --> 16:37.864
Hmm, how time flies.
Seems like yesterday

16:37.964 --> 16:39.965
The first satellite orbited
through space.

16:39.965 --> 16:43.732
Yes.
Now we launch my godchild.

16:43.799 --> 16:46.100
I suppose people will get used
to the Thunderer,

16:46.167 --> 16:47.501
Its implications.

16:47.568 --> 16:49.301
SAUL:
Hey, Dad!

16:49.368 --> 16:50.502
Hello, son.

16:50.569 --> 16:52.369
PHYLLIS:
Hi, Dad.

16:52.435 --> 16:53.970
Hi, Phyllis.

16:54.003 --> 16:55.971
How's fishing, Dad?
Not very good.

16:56.004 --> 16:58.972
Catch anything?
Probably the sniffles.

16:58.972 --> 17:00.737
Water cold?
A little.

17:00.804 --> 17:02.438
Come on, Phyllis,
let's get dressed, huh?

17:02.505 --> 17:06.138
See you, kids.
SAUL: So long.

17:06.205 --> 17:08.575
Life's a wonderful thing,
doctor.

17:08.641 --> 17:11.576
Let's hope
we can preserve it for them.

17:19.310 --> 17:20.511
(All chuckling)

17:20.578 --> 17:22.112
BOY:
Hey, Bud! Ken!

17:22.179 --> 17:23.980
FRIEDA:
Hey, watch it, kids, huh?

17:23.980 --> 17:25.612
Come and get them
while they're hot, boys.

17:25.679 --> 17:26.981
Plenty more
where these came from.

17:26.981 --> 17:28.281
Oh, honey,
just put them on the table.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.415
We're up to here with hot dogs.
Okay.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.749
Here you are.
Thank you.

17:32.816 --> 17:34.449
Well, at this
parent-teachers meeting

17:34.516 --> 17:36.017
They put me on the spot.

17:36.084 --> 17:38.350
They kept saying,
"When is it gonna end?

17:38.417 --> 17:41.685
"Year after year of racing,
racing, trying to find something

17:41.751 --> 17:44.986
Bigger and better to blow
ourselves off the planet."

17:45.052 --> 17:46.454
When they ask me
these questions,

17:46.521 --> 17:47.721
What do I tell them?

17:47.788 --> 17:49.455
You just say to them
that down there

17:49.522 --> 17:50.688
Stands the Thunderer,

17:50.754 --> 17:51.889
And what are we
waiting for?

17:51.989 --> 17:53.122
FRIEDA:
Hank, dear,

17:53.189 --> 17:56.490
Let's not be serious
tonight, hmm?

17:56.556 --> 17:59.157
It's your first day here, Dave.
What's your viewpoint?

17:59.224 --> 18:01.192
Same as my wife's.

18:01.258 --> 18:03.825
In all its history our country
has never started a war.

18:03.892 --> 18:05.325
The Thunderer
is to prevent war.

18:05.392 --> 18:08.060
I still say that when
that satellite gets up there

18:08.127 --> 18:10.495
With the Thunderer and it gets
into its orbit, we should...

18:10.561 --> 18:11.829
FRIEDA:
We should take a vacation.

18:11.896 --> 18:14.163
That's what you need, Hank,
a nice vacation.

18:14.230 --> 18:15.762
(All chuckle)

18:15.829 --> 18:18.797
Dave, why don't you and Hank
take a swim, huh?

18:18.863 --> 18:20.198
Come on, let's take
a dip with the kids.

18:20.264 --> 18:21.731
What do you say?
That's a good idea.

18:21.798 --> 18:23.865
Eadie.
Yes, Daddy?

18:23.999 --> 18:25.501
Wanna go for a swim with me,
honey?

18:25.567 --> 18:27.301
Sure, Daddy, I'll go, I...

18:27.367 --> 18:29.567
(Machine humming)

18:40.737 --> 18:43.238
I think I had
too many hot dogs, Daddy.

18:43.305 --> 18:46.007
I'd better not go
for a swim.

18:46.007 --> 18:48.341
How about the rest of you kids?
Anybody want to go for a dip?

18:48.408 --> 18:50.709
Bud? Ken?

18:50.775 --> 18:52.109
No, thanks.
No, thanks, Dad.

18:52.175 --> 18:53.809
Eadie, I'll race you
to the cliff.

18:53.875 --> 18:57.010
Sure.

18:57.076 --> 18:59.011
Our daughter sure
got over her stomach ache

18:59.011 --> 19:00.311
In a hurry, didn't she?
She sure did.

19:00.377 --> 19:02.112
You ready for the big plunge?
Yeah, sure.

19:02.178 --> 19:03.512
Hello, Joe, Peg.
Hi.

19:03.578 --> 19:05.014
Hi.
Hi, Frieda.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.313
Oh, hi. This is Peg
and Joe Gamble, Anne Brewster.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.080
Hi.
Nice to know you, Anne.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.181
Well, we're a little late,
but, uh, then of course,

19:11.248 --> 19:12.448
Nobody invited us.

19:12.515 --> 19:14.016
Joe! We were invited.

19:14.016 --> 19:16.017
You fell asleep,
don't you remember?

19:16.083 --> 19:18.182
Joe, stop carrying that chip
on your shoulder.

19:18.249 --> 19:20.517
Well, he isn't feeling
very well tonight, Frieda.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.718
My wife is just trying to
be polite.

19:22.784 --> 19:24.420
She means I'm tight.

19:24.486 --> 19:26.153
Did you get that job, Joe?

19:26.220 --> 19:28.087
No, I flunked the test.

19:28.154 --> 19:30.288
Peg will have to go
on bringing in the bank roll.

19:30.355 --> 19:33.022
Please, Joe.

19:33.055 --> 19:34.222
Where's Tim?

19:34.288 --> 19:35.889
He's with the other children.

19:36.023 --> 19:39.324
He's always running off without
telling us where he's going.

19:39.390 --> 19:41.091
If I were
that kid's real father, I...

19:41.158 --> 19:42.291
But you're not his father

19:42.358 --> 19:43.491
And I'm not your wife,

19:43.558 --> 19:44.892
So I can afford
to tell you a few things

19:45.026 --> 19:46.526
That have been on my mind,
Joe Gamble!

19:46.593 --> 19:49.160
He's a spoiled brat!

19:49.227 --> 19:51.328
Tim!

19:51.394 --> 19:53.929
Tim!

19:54.029 --> 19:55.330
Tim!

19:55.396 --> 19:57.729
(Suspenseful,
mysterious theme playing)

21:04.285 --> 21:06.886
TIM:
Where do we go?

21:06.953 --> 21:08.787
Up this way.

21:38.228 --> 21:41.230
You knew it would be here.

21:41.297 --> 21:44.866
Did it tell you?
Yes.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.100
You're going to be
the leader.

21:51.167 --> 21:54.301
You'll have to do
what I tell you to.

21:54.368 --> 21:56.669
I'm getting out of here.

22:01.771 --> 22:04.572
(Gasps and whimpers)

22:04.638 --> 22:08.106
I... I can't move.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.975
You can now.

22:17.341 --> 22:19.110
Try.

22:21.178 --> 22:23.512
From now on
when I ask you to do something,

22:23.579 --> 22:24.779
We'll do it together.

22:24.845 --> 22:26.545
Yes, Bud.
Yes, Bud.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.579
Sure.

22:50.353 --> 22:51.787
DAVE:
Hank, is Eadie back yet?

22:51.853 --> 22:54.921
Just this minute?
Good, yeah. Yeah.

22:54.988 --> 22:56.555
Oh, it's all right.
Thank you very much.

22:56.622 --> 22:58.123
They just came in.

22:58.190 --> 22:59.523
Where have you been?

22:59.590 --> 23:00.924
Sorry, Mother.

23:00.991 --> 23:02.657
I ought to wallop
the both of you,

23:02.725 --> 23:04.891
Worrying your mother,
staying out till almost 9!

23:04.957 --> 23:06.592
We were
just on the beach.

23:06.658 --> 23:07.925
You knew
this was our first day here,

23:07.992 --> 23:09.559
Yet you made me walk up
and down the beach

23:09.626 --> 23:11.094
Hunting for you
and your brother!

23:11.127 --> 23:12.927
Dave, stop hounding at them.
Go get undressed.

23:12.994 --> 23:14.928
Tell 'em, Bud.
Tell 'em!

23:14.995 --> 23:16.962
ANNE:
Tell us what?

23:17.096 --> 23:20.697
We can tell 'em, can't we, Bud?

23:27.399 --> 23:30.165
Yes. I know.

23:30.232 --> 23:31.433
What's the matter?

23:31.500 --> 23:32.800
What are you talking
to yourself for?

23:32.866 --> 23:35.568
Are you sick?
No, I'm all right.

23:37.569 --> 23:39.670
Weren't you gonna
tell them, Bud?

23:42.104 --> 23:44.270
We found something
that fell out of the sky

23:44.337 --> 23:46.605
This afternoon.

23:46.671 --> 23:48.139
We know where it is.

23:48.206 --> 23:49.172
The sky?

23:49.239 --> 23:52.773
Bud's telling the truth.
I saw it too.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.608
It fell out of the sky.

23:55.674 --> 23:57.275
Well, you've gotta
believe him!

23:57.342 --> 23:59.310
How long did it take you
to dream up that yarn?

23:59.376 --> 24:00.976
I didn't dream it up.

24:01.110 --> 24:03.011
You think a lie like that's
going to make it all right,

24:03.111 --> 24:05.445
Staying out until all hours?
It's not a lie.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.677
Something's wrong.
I know it is.

24:06.744 --> 24:08.412
Something is wrong.

24:08.478 --> 24:10.779
You're upsetting your mother.
Let's go to bed. Come on.

24:10.846 --> 24:12.613
Dad, you've gotta believe me!
Believe what?

24:12.679 --> 24:14.515
Some crazy story you made up
for an excuse!

24:14.581 --> 24:16.816
Listen, for two cents,
I'd...

24:18.349 --> 24:21.217
I can't move my arm.

24:31.585 --> 24:33.120
It's not a lie, Dad.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.922
Please sit down
and listen to me.

24:35.988 --> 24:38.123
You too, Mom.

24:42.757 --> 24:45.790
We were coming back
from the rocket site

24:45.857 --> 24:49.125
And all of a sudden we heard
this strange sound.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.659
(Explosion)

25:41.643 --> 25:44.244
What are you doing here?
I'm ready.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.844
She knows, Dad.
Come on.

25:55.881 --> 25:58.648
(Thunder rumbling)

26:19.189 --> 26:23.357
Where do you think you're going?
I asked you a question!

26:23.423 --> 26:24.823
I was just going out
for a walk.

26:24.890 --> 26:27.291
You're a liar.
You're up to something.

26:27.358 --> 26:29.659
Please, Joe, let me go.
I'll be back soon.

26:29.725 --> 26:31.693
You're going
nowhere except to bed.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.527
I've got to go!

26:33.594 --> 26:36.327
You little sneak!
Come back here!

26:36.394 --> 26:39.595
Come back here!

26:39.662 --> 26:41.663
Come back here!

26:45.597 --> 26:49.966
TIM:
Hey, Bud, Ken, wait for me!

26:50.999 --> 26:54.167
(Tense theme playing)

26:56.268 --> 26:57.434
JOE:
Come back here!

26:57.501 --> 26:59.869
I'll break your neck!

27:15.974 --> 27:19.008
Hey, Bud, wait for me!

27:20.576 --> 27:21.742
JOE:
Come back here!

27:21.809 --> 27:24.177
(Thunder rumbling)

27:33.246 --> 27:36.647
Come back here!
I'll break your neck!

27:42.815 --> 27:45.183
Come back here, you!

27:51.185 --> 27:53.186
Come back here!

28:02.690 --> 28:04.655
(Joe grunting)

28:04.722 --> 28:07.257
I'll teach you
to run away from me!

28:07.324 --> 28:09.992
(Tim screams)

28:13.493 --> 28:14.827
(Electricity crackles)

28:14.894 --> 28:16.894
(Screams)

28:16.960 --> 28:20.295
(Suspenseful theme playing)

28:28.931 --> 28:30.665
(Panting)

28:35.366 --> 28:37.501
(Slow theme playing)

29:56.292 --> 29:57.427
Good night, Bud.
Good night.

29:57.493 --> 29:58.827
So long.
Goodbye.

29:58.893 --> 30:00.894
So long, Tim.

30:05.030 --> 30:08.565
(Mysterious theme
playing)

30:21.334 --> 30:23.902
Oh, Timmy.

30:27.370 --> 30:28.504
(Sobbing)

30:28.571 --> 30:30.771
Don't cry, Mom.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.807
I'm not crying,
Tim.

30:47.176 --> 30:50.410
Eadie!

30:50.477 --> 30:51.978
Hi, Daddy.

30:52.045 --> 30:54.446
Brewster, what's this all about?
Where have you all been?

30:54.512 --> 30:57.947
You see, Mr. Johnson, I thought
I heard something on the beach

30:58.013 --> 31:00.247
And Eadie saw me...
I couldn't sleep so I...

31:00.313 --> 31:02.949
I don't know how you raise
your kids, Brewster, but I...

31:03.015 --> 31:04.983
What's that
you're holding there?

31:05.050 --> 31:07.451
Just an interesting
rock formation I found.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.851
I don't like my kids
staying up

31:08.917 --> 31:10.585
Until all hours of the night.
I'm sorry.

31:10.652 --> 31:12.484
PEG: Hank!
What is it, Peg?

31:12.551 --> 31:14.618
Hank, it's Joe.
He's dead.

31:14.685 --> 31:16.286
Dead?
Yes, please come.

31:16.353 --> 31:17.886
HANK:
Get in the trailer, Eadie.

31:17.953 --> 31:18.954
Don't go, Dad.

31:19.020 --> 31:21.356
You don't have to go,
Mr. Brewster.

31:21.422 --> 31:23.456
BUD:
Go home, kids.

31:23.522 --> 31:26.656
(Soft theme playing)

31:45.129 --> 31:46.363
It's all right, Mom.

31:46.429 --> 31:48.630
We got it.
We walked and got it.

31:48.696 --> 31:50.630
And Joe Gamble
was killed.

31:50.697 --> 31:52.831
Killed?
Joe tried to hurt Timmy.

31:52.898 --> 31:54.966
It didn't want Timmy
to be hurt.

31:55.032 --> 31:57.066
Yes?

31:58.300 --> 32:00.702
There.

32:00.769 --> 32:03.869
I don't want this thing here.
Take it back.

32:03.935 --> 32:05.402
Get rid of it,
do you understand?

32:05.469 --> 32:07.103
Get rid of it this minute!
I don't care!

32:07.170 --> 32:08.936
(Siren wailing)

32:11.637 --> 32:14.605
It's the ambulance
for Joe Gamble.

32:14.672 --> 32:17.272
We'll have to wait.

32:17.338 --> 32:18.540
Get it out now.

32:18.607 --> 32:20.741
(Mysterious theme playing)

32:23.342 --> 32:25.576
Don't be worried, Mother.

32:25.642 --> 32:28.442
We can't take it
out of the house tonight.

32:28.509 --> 32:30.777
It won't let us.

32:35.312 --> 32:37.446
(People chattering)

32:42.915 --> 32:45.516
If there's anything
we can do, Peg, let us know.

32:45.583 --> 32:47.616
Thanks, Hank, you've
just been wonderful.

32:47.683 --> 32:49.484
Take good care
of your mother, Tim.

32:49.550 --> 32:50.884
Good night.

32:55.785 --> 32:57.687
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Gamble.

32:57.753 --> 32:59.521
There was nothing
that could be done.

32:59.588 --> 33:02.088
He must have died instantly
in his chair.

33:02.154 --> 33:03.854
I warned him if he kept on
living in this way...

33:03.921 --> 33:05.789
I know, Doctor,
thanks a lot.

33:05.855 --> 33:08.656
(Siren wailing)
Good night.

33:24.461 --> 33:27.597
(Suspenseful theme playing)

33:32.797 --> 33:34.698
Dave.

33:34.764 --> 33:37.900
Good morning.
Hi, folks.

33:37.966 --> 33:40.001
It's grown,
hasn't it?

33:40.067 --> 33:41.534
We've had a night
to think about it.

33:41.601 --> 33:43.867
What are we to do?
(Knocks on door)

33:43.934 --> 33:46.168
Don't let anyone in, Mother.

33:46.302 --> 33:48.703
Don't let anyone in.

33:53.538 --> 33:55.739
(Knocks on door)

33:59.307 --> 34:00.473
Yes, Frieda.

34:00.540 --> 34:02.608
Oh, there you are.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.142
The way kids drink milk,
I'm all out of it.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.775
Do you have any?

34:06.842 --> 34:09.476
I'm sorry, Frieda, the boys
just drank the last drop.

34:09.543 --> 34:10.842
Is something
the matter?

34:10.909 --> 34:12.777
I'm not feeling
very well.

34:12.844 --> 34:14.210
That's why
I didn't invite you in.

34:14.311 --> 34:16.013
I'm afraid I wouldn't be
very good company.

34:16.079 --> 34:19.346
Oh, of course, dear.
Did you hear about Joe Gamble?

34:19.413 --> 34:20.679
Yes.

34:20.746 --> 34:22.679
Amazing. To be sitting
in a chair reading

34:22.746 --> 34:24.380
And to go like that.

34:24.447 --> 34:25.947
He was still so young.

34:26.014 --> 34:28.748
I wish I could say
I was heartbroken, but I'm not.

34:28.815 --> 34:31.581
He treated Peg
and the boy miserably.

34:31.649 --> 34:34.083
Well, thanks, anyway.

34:38.953 --> 34:41.721
(Suspenseful theme playing)

34:41.786 --> 34:44.321
All right, listen, I want
answers, do you understand?

34:44.321 --> 34:45.621
I must have answers.

34:45.687 --> 34:48.054
Don't be worried,
Mother, please.

34:48.121 --> 34:49.922
What is this thing
that's come into our lives?

34:49.989 --> 34:52.623
Will you answer me?
Why did it come here?

34:52.690 --> 34:54.458
What does it
intend to do?

34:54.525 --> 34:56.226
What have you kids
got to do with it?

34:56.326 --> 34:59.326
We have to keep it safe
and warm until tonight.

34:59.326 --> 35:02.393
We've got to do what it
wants us to do until tonight.

35:02.460 --> 35:05.061
Why tonight?

35:05.128 --> 35:08.463
Do you hear your father?
Why tonight?

35:08.530 --> 35:09.962
Look, I'm trying
to be patient.

35:10.029 --> 35:11.830
I'm trying to understand,
but I'm scared.

35:11.896 --> 35:13.531
Do you understand?
Your mother's scared.

35:13.597 --> 35:15.232
Don't be scared, Mother.

35:15.332 --> 35:17.066
How does it tell you,
and why?

35:17.133 --> 35:19.967
I don't think
you'd understand.

35:21.433 --> 35:23.800
(Phone ringing)

35:30.937 --> 35:33.971
Hello?
Please, don't be upset.

35:35.404 --> 35:36.939
We have to hide it.

35:37.005 --> 35:39.005
Come on.
DAVE: Oh, yes, major.

35:39.072 --> 35:42.407
I was just on my way
to the laboratory.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.342
What? Yes, sir.

35:45.408 --> 35:47.608
Yes, I see. Right away.

35:50.443 --> 35:52.077
That was the major
alerting me.

35:52.144 --> 35:53.578
They're launching
the Thunderer.

35:53.645 --> 35:55.245
And do you know when?
Tonight.

35:55.345 --> 35:56.646
Tonight?

35:56.712 --> 35:58.079
Then what
the children meant...?

35:58.146 --> 35:59.879
Yeah.
Where are they?

35:59.946 --> 36:01.780
They just left.

36:11.616 --> 36:13.351
MAN:
Brewster. Hey, Brewster.

36:13.384 --> 36:15.417
Do want a lift down to the lab?
Did you see the kids?

36:15.484 --> 36:16.918
Yeah, I thought
that being your first day,

36:16.985 --> 36:18.386
I'd drive you down
to the lab,

36:18.453 --> 36:20.686
Show you around, introduce you...
Where'd the kids go?

36:20.753 --> 36:22.654
They went over the embankment.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.854
Hey, what's the matter?

36:34.358 --> 36:36.624
DAVE:
Bud! Ken!

36:40.359 --> 36:42.793
Bud! Ken! Wait!

36:55.365 --> 36:57.465
(Tense theme playing)

37:03.767 --> 37:05.367
DAVE:
I just heard about the launching

37:05.433 --> 37:07.068
Of the Thunderer tonight.

37:08.401 --> 37:10.470
You knew before
I did, didn't you?

37:10.536 --> 37:12.537
Yes.

37:34.078 --> 37:35.511
MAN:
Yes.

37:35.578 --> 37:37.412
What time?

37:37.479 --> 37:39.378
Yes, I understand.

37:39.444 --> 37:42.245
Thank you very much.

37:42.380 --> 37:43.646
That was the depot.

37:43.713 --> 37:45.214
Propellant for the sixth stage
is on its way.

37:45.281 --> 37:46.781
Truck should be here
this afternoon.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.449
Good. Tonight,
we push this button.

37:49.516 --> 37:50.950
The most powerful
sky horse of all

37:51.017 --> 37:52.449
Joins the celestial
merry-go-round.

37:52.516 --> 37:54.617
Let's hope we get that brass
ring, Dr. Wahrman.

37:54.684 --> 37:57.151
Hmm. There's a very interesting
report,

37:57.218 --> 37:59.419
Came in from the engineering
department.

37:59.486 --> 38:00.986
I'd like you to go over it
with me.

38:01.052 --> 38:02.553
It correlates all the figures
I had...

38:02.620 --> 38:04.486
Colonel. One of the technicians
wants to see you.

38:04.552 --> 38:06.153
A fellow named Dave Brewster.
What about him?

38:06.220 --> 38:08.155
He's waiting outside.
He insists on talking to you.

38:08.222 --> 38:10.055
Not now, major,
the press is on its way.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.390
Brewster says it's urgent.
A matter for security.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.924
He seems pretty upset.

38:13.991 --> 38:16.392
All right, I'll see him.
Now, who's Brewster?

38:16.425 --> 38:17.757
Sent him down
from San Francisco.

38:17.824 --> 38:20.158
Oh. Oh, about this report.

38:20.225 --> 38:22.626
Look at these figures here.
See column 7?

38:28.029 --> 38:29.961
Hello, Brewster.
What's on your mind?

38:30.029 --> 38:32.196
You can talk freely in
front of Dr. Wahrman.

38:32.262 --> 38:34.197
Oh, yes. Yes, go on.

38:34.263 --> 38:36.264
I'm not sure you'll believe
what I tell you.

38:36.398 --> 38:37.864
Try us.

38:37.931 --> 38:39.565
It's about tonight
and the Thunderer.

38:39.632 --> 38:41.732
The launching?
Yes, Dr. Wahrman.

38:41.799 --> 38:44.066
Tonight...
OFFICER: Colonel.

38:44.133 --> 38:46.401
You know, Wicks from the news,
and Lloyd of the Sentinel.

38:46.467 --> 38:47.668
Of course. Hello, Dan.
Colonel.

38:47.735 --> 38:49.035
Richard.
Colonel.

38:49.102 --> 38:51.136
Good morning, doctor.
About tonight, sir.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.404
Uh, what's the story?
Fire away.

38:53.437 --> 38:55.670
The doctor and I will try
to answer your questions.

38:55.737 --> 38:57.870
Will the new type of warhead be
inside the satellite

38:57.937 --> 38:59.238
When it's launched?
Yes.

38:59.305 --> 39:02.739
You see without such
a specialized kind of warhead,

39:02.806 --> 39:06.409
We'd be merely launching
one more satellite in space.

39:06.475 --> 39:08.408
There are already a dozen,
as you know.

39:08.408 --> 39:12.410
How high will the orbit be?
Approximately 1000 miles.

39:13.410 --> 39:14.776
Can you tell us
how many stages

39:14.844 --> 39:16.644
The rocket will have?

39:16.711 --> 39:18.278
Yeah. Six.

39:18.412 --> 39:19.811
As it nears the orbit,

39:19.877 --> 39:21.812
The last stage will be
the dropping of the nose cone.

39:21.878 --> 39:24.414
Dr. Wahrman, do you believe that
another country

39:24.414 --> 39:26.515
Has already launched a satellite
containing a warhead?

39:26.581 --> 39:29.516
Well, we don't know.
You see, in this race,

39:29.582 --> 39:31.916
We may be only a few hours ahead
of another country.

39:31.982 --> 39:36.017
What if the test is a dud?
Heh, we're not planning on it.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.584
DAN:
What if any enemy launches
its own satellite

39:38.651 --> 39:41.952
With a warhead
and it isn't a test?

39:42.019 --> 39:43.720
Well, let us hope no country
in the world

39:43.787 --> 39:46.221
Would be paranoid enough
to do what you suggest.

39:46.287 --> 39:47.521
There are constant rumors.

39:47.587 --> 39:49.288
Not a newspaper
in the country this week

39:49.422 --> 39:51.456
That hasn't had
dozens of telephone calls.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.323
After all, you can understand,
Colonel.

39:53.423 --> 39:55.957
Years and years
of cold war nerves.

39:56.024 --> 39:57.657
Of course I understand.

39:57.724 --> 39:59.324
But isn't it your job,
gentlemen,

39:59.424 --> 40:01.158
To quiet rumors of that kind?

40:01.225 --> 40:02.426
It isn't easy.

40:02.426 --> 40:04.760
Not when every hour
is a zero hour.

40:06.028 --> 40:07.328
Let us hope
that the Thunderer

40:07.428 --> 40:10.128
Will be launched in time
to discourage anyone

40:10.194 --> 40:12.562
From attacking our country
or our allies.

40:12.629 --> 40:14.496
That's all gentlemen,
I have a busy schedule.

40:14.563 --> 40:16.330
Thanks, colonel.
Dan.

40:16.396 --> 40:19.698
Good day, gentlemen.
Thank you, sir.

40:19.765 --> 40:21.597
I'm sorry, Brewster.
Now, what was it?

40:21.664 --> 40:23.099
Oh, yeah.
Something about the Thunderer.

40:23.166 --> 40:26.500
Yes, sir. I'm glad you're here,
Dr. Wahrman.

40:26.567 --> 40:28.101
What I'm about to say...

40:28.168 --> 40:29.568
It needs explanation
from someone

40:29.635 --> 40:32.169
With a greater scientific mind
than mine.

40:32.236 --> 40:35.269
Well, go on, Brewster.
What is it?

40:35.336 --> 40:36.470
I believe the Thunderer

40:36.537 --> 40:38.203
Will never
get off the ground.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.504
What?
That's a wild statement to make.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.173
Unless you know something
we don't know.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.373
Have you proof of sabotage?

40:44.441 --> 40:47.040
Whatever either of you
is thinking, you're wrong.

40:47.106 --> 40:49.407
It's beyond understanding.

40:49.474 --> 40:53.376
Last night, my two children,
small boys...

40:53.443 --> 40:55.209
Last night,
down on the beach,

40:55.276 --> 40:57.510
They found something w...

41:08.714 --> 41:10.782
How the devil
did you get in here?

41:10.849 --> 41:14.449
Top security for everyone
but children, eh?

41:15.916 --> 41:17.250
Hello, Dad.

41:19.951 --> 41:21.719
So that's your boy?

41:27.087 --> 41:28.687
So there you are.

41:28.754 --> 41:31.455
Sorry, colonel,
I don't know how he got past us.

41:31.521 --> 41:34.122
Neither do I. Take him out.

41:34.189 --> 41:35.990
Goodbye, Dad.

41:36.057 --> 41:37.222
Your boy will be outside.

41:37.289 --> 41:38.457
You can take him home
in a minute.

41:38.523 --> 41:40.458
Now, what were you saying?

41:40.492 --> 41:42.759
That... That...

41:47.327 --> 41:48.727
What's the matter,
Brewster?

42:10.634 --> 42:12.702
You'll be all right,
Mr. Brewster.

42:12.769 --> 42:14.802
We'll get you to bed
right away.

42:14.869 --> 42:16.835
Here, sit right down here.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.472
No.

42:21.472 --> 42:24.506
I can't.

42:24.573 --> 42:27.506
I've got...
I've got to get to the cave.

42:27.573 --> 42:31.075
The cave? What cave?

42:31.141 --> 42:32.941
The children.

42:33.008 --> 42:35.642
You'd better sit down.
No.

42:50.381 --> 42:52.481
Dave.

42:52.514 --> 42:54.915
(Whimpering)
Darling.

42:54.982 --> 42:57.183
How is he?
He'll be all right.

42:57.249 --> 43:00.085
All he needs is some rest.
We'll take good care of him.

43:00.151 --> 43:02.319
Would you mind waiting outside
for a moment, please?

43:02.386 --> 43:05.552
All right, doctor.
Come on, children.

43:17.223 --> 43:20.391
(Suspenseful theme playing)

43:43.031 --> 43:45.365
What's the matter?
There's something wrong

43:45.499 --> 43:47.200
With the steering wheel.
Stop it.

43:50.301 --> 43:52.902
I can't stop it.
There's no brakes!

43:54.834 --> 43:56.703
Get the brake on her...
They're gone!

43:56.769 --> 43:58.704
The steering wheel's gone!

44:11.307 --> 44:13.574
Stop!

44:13.641 --> 44:15.510
We're going off the road!
Watch out!

44:17.043 --> 44:18.777
No control at all!

44:28.346 --> 44:31.748
What happened?
Beats me.

44:34.749 --> 44:36.516
Heh, almost ran into the ocean,
didn't you?

44:36.549 --> 44:38.050
Now, where's
the nearest phone, kid?

44:38.117 --> 44:39.984
There's a gas station
down the road about a mile.

44:40.051 --> 44:42.685
Steering rod's split wide open,
and the brake's gone.

44:42.752 --> 44:44.085
Anything I can do to help?

44:44.152 --> 44:45.619
I have my bike.
No, thanks.

44:45.685 --> 44:47.619
What's in the truck?
Look, kid, we're in a jam.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.253
Now please don't annoy us,
will you?

44:49.320 --> 44:50.987
I was just asking.
Well, don't ask.

44:51.054 --> 44:53.621
Look, I better stay here. Uh, go
phone the depot,

44:53.687 --> 44:55.889
Tell them to get another truck
here as soon as they can.

44:55.956 --> 44:57.089
And phone Eagle Point.

44:57.156 --> 44:58.823
Tell them what happened.
Right.

45:01.857 --> 45:03.791
(Phone ringing)

45:08.827 --> 45:11.793
Hello? Hello?

45:13.228 --> 45:16.396
Operator? Operator?

45:18.296 --> 45:19.664
(Phone rings)

45:19.731 --> 45:21.431
Hello?

45:21.531 --> 45:24.164
Yes, this is Sergeant Cooper,
speaking.

45:24.231 --> 45:25.998
Hello?

45:26.065 --> 45:28.699
(Indistinct noises
over phone)

45:28.766 --> 45:30.934
Hello?

45:31.000 --> 45:34.368
Operator? Operator?

45:41.037 --> 45:42.538
Hi.

45:57.776 --> 46:00.576
Eadie!

46:00.643 --> 46:01.844
Eadie!

46:01.910 --> 46:04.011
I guess she's still down
on the beach.

46:04.078 --> 46:06.545
Oh, I'll find her, hon.

46:08.379 --> 46:10.547
Eadie!

46:11.880 --> 46:13.648
Eadie!

46:27.885 --> 46:29.653
Eadie!

46:31.354 --> 46:33.321
Eadie!

46:36.156 --> 46:38.822
Eadie!
Hi, Daddy.

46:38.889 --> 46:40.890
You had me scared, honey.
I didn't know where you were.

46:40.957 --> 46:42.790
I found your jacket
and a towel back at the beach.

46:42.857 --> 46:44.591
Come on, Daddy.
Let's go for a swim.

46:44.658 --> 46:46.659
I haven't been all day.
Wait a minute, honey.

46:46.725 --> 46:48.359
What were you doing in there
all alone?

46:48.425 --> 46:51.226
Just playing, Daddy.
It's so nice out.

46:51.293 --> 46:54.395
I bet the water's warm.
Come on, let's go for a swim.

46:54.462 --> 46:55.928
Now, what's the matter
with you, honey?

46:55.995 --> 46:57.929
What are you looking back
in there for?

46:57.996 --> 46:59.063
Nothing, Daddy.

46:59.129 --> 47:01.230
I'm not looking
at anything, honest.

47:01.297 --> 47:02.964
Eadie, honey.

47:03.030 --> 47:03.997
What's in there?

47:04.064 --> 47:07.265
Nothing, Daddy.
Just an old cave.

47:07.331 --> 47:08.866
Come on,
let's get out of here.

47:08.932 --> 47:12.134
I will, honey. As soon as I
find out what this is all about.

47:12.201 --> 47:16.769
Don't Daddy! Please! Please!

47:43.443 --> 47:45.378
Daddy!

47:45.444 --> 47:47.979
Daddy, you all right?

48:07.919 --> 48:09.852
(Door opens)

48:09.920 --> 48:12.087
Hello, dear.
(Door closes)

48:12.153 --> 48:13.888
Did you find Eadie?

48:15.922 --> 48:17.188
Eadie?

48:17.254 --> 48:20.489
What's the matter, Hank?
What's happened?

48:20.589 --> 48:23.823
Nothing, I went swimming.

49:32.913 --> 49:35.047
(Mysterious theme playing)

50:21.696 --> 50:24.330
We have to go now.
Already?

50:24.397 --> 50:25.664
Yes, it's time.

50:25.731 --> 50:28.265
The other children
have already started.

50:28.332 --> 50:30.433
Come on.

50:36.234 --> 50:39.101
3:45...

50:39.168 --> 50:42.970
Phone out

50:43.037 --> 50:46.839
Of order.

50:46.905 --> 50:48.704
4:30...

50:50.072 --> 50:51.772
Johnson

50:53.640 --> 50:57.441
In hospital.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.842
Now, I pride myself
in knowing a little bit

51:01.908 --> 51:04.844
About permutations
and combinations.

51:04.910 --> 51:08.411
As you say,
this may all be coincidence.

51:09.646 --> 51:12.047
I've studied these reports
again and again,

51:12.112 --> 51:14.246
And I agree, there seems
to be no connection

51:14.312 --> 51:16.380
Between any of these events.

51:16.447 --> 51:18.681
That's what makes it
so incredible.

51:18.748 --> 51:20.949
Except there's one
brightly-colored thread

51:21.015 --> 51:24.650
That runs throughout the day,
tying all these events together.

51:24.650 --> 51:28.317
I couldn't find any link.
Now, listen, Alan.

51:28.384 --> 51:29.685
"In the presence
of his little boy,"

51:29.752 --> 51:31.819
Technician Brewster
collapses.

51:31.886 --> 51:34.954
A few hours later, according
to this truck driver,

51:35.020 --> 51:37.387
As a child watches
from his bicycle,

51:37.454 --> 51:39.420
The truck runs off the road.

51:39.487 --> 51:43.990
Two children watch a sentry
try to phone for help and fail.

51:44.057 --> 51:46.991
Johnson goes searching for his
little daughter on the beach,

51:47.058 --> 51:49.525
Collapses,
and can't remember anything.

51:49.658 --> 51:50.858
I know all that.

51:50.924 --> 51:52.525
You're just saying
what we already know.

51:52.659 --> 51:54.893
Now, just a second. Can't you
see?

51:54.960 --> 51:56.760
A child or children
was present

51:56.827 --> 51:58.294
At each
of these events today.

51:58.361 --> 52:00.663
Well, what if that's so.
What are you driving at?

52:00.663 --> 52:02.362
I don't know.

52:02.429 --> 52:04.763
That's all here
in black and white.

52:04.829 --> 52:06.930
Children, children,
children.

52:06.997 --> 52:09.698
What can the children
have to do with it?

52:11.866 --> 52:13.566
Has Brewster
left the dispensary?

52:13.667 --> 52:16.399
No, doctor wants him
to stay overnight.

52:16.467 --> 52:18.567
Why?

52:18.667 --> 52:22.270
Well, on the surface,
everything seems calm.

52:22.336 --> 52:24.370
Yet, all day,
the unexpected.

52:24.436 --> 52:26.937
Like pebbles
dropping one by one,

52:27.004 --> 52:29.137
Ruffling the surface.

52:31.372 --> 52:34.739
Well, within an hour,
the Thunderer will be launched.

52:34.806 --> 52:38.040
I better get going.
I'll see you at the Blockhouse.

52:38.107 --> 52:39.675
All right.

53:42.295 --> 53:43.429
Guard?

53:43.496 --> 53:45.196
Why, yes, sir?

53:45.262 --> 53:47.463
Why did you let those children
inside here?

53:47.530 --> 53:49.131
Dr. Wahrman, what children?

53:49.198 --> 53:53.165
At least half a dozen children
just walked out of that gate.

53:53.232 --> 53:54.700
Oh, no, sir.

53:54.700 --> 53:56.700
No, there haven't been
any children around here.

53:56.766 --> 53:59.601
Besides, the gate's locked.

54:02.002 --> 54:03.703
See?

54:21.774 --> 54:24.809
I thought the doctor told you
to stay overnight.

54:24.875 --> 54:26.710
I wanted to be
at the launching.

54:26.710 --> 54:28.811
Did you wanna see me
about something?

54:28.877 --> 54:31.278
What did you tell the doctor
about, this morning?

54:31.345 --> 54:34.212
The truth, that I fainted.

54:34.278 --> 54:35.846
The matter of your voice?

54:35.913 --> 54:37.580
I didn't tell him about that.

54:37.714 --> 54:40.915
Why should I?
It wasn't important.

54:40.981 --> 54:44.249
Total paralysis of the throat
muscle is not important?

54:44.316 --> 54:46.216
Brewster.
You see, a man of science

54:46.282 --> 54:48.183
Is like a deep-sea diver.

54:48.250 --> 54:50.317
He mustn't be afraid
to walk down

54:50.383 --> 54:52.451
Where it's dark
and frightening,

54:52.518 --> 54:55.920
In the hopes of scooping up
a handful of truth.

54:57.620 --> 54:58.954
Brewster, this morning,

54:59.021 --> 55:01.788
What did you want to tell us
about the children?

55:04.388 --> 55:05.823
I've made the obvious
deductions.

55:05.889 --> 55:08.057
They don't seem to add up.

55:08.124 --> 55:11.924
I remember very well
what you said this morning.

55:11.990 --> 55:13.225
What did I say?

55:13.291 --> 55:16.627
There may be trouble
launching the Thunderer.

55:16.727 --> 55:20.761
Obvious deduction,
a spy in our midst.

55:24.729 --> 55:28.930
But a few minutes ago,
in front of the powerhouse,

55:28.996 --> 55:32.464
I saw the incredible.
The unbelievable.

55:32.532 --> 55:35.733
Spies do not work
in unbelievable ways.

55:35.766 --> 55:37.333
Always through
counter-intelligence

55:37.399 --> 55:39.934
Can be drawn
logical conclusions.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.935
But what I saw a group
of children do a few minutes ago

55:43.001 --> 55:45.236
Is something
for which there is no name,

55:45.302 --> 55:48.136
Unless you can name it.

55:49.302 --> 55:51.070
I can't tell you anything.

55:52.204 --> 55:53.839
I see.

55:56.773 --> 55:59.541
Do you mean, your voice
would become paralyzed again

55:59.607 --> 56:01.407
If you should tell me
that some force,

56:01.474 --> 56:05.575
Still unknown to man,
has been able, through children,

56:05.642 --> 56:08.243
To shatter a steering rod,

56:08.309 --> 56:10.744
To take away a man's mind,

56:10.744 --> 56:12.046
Another man's voice,

56:12.112 --> 56:15.512
To allow a boy to walk
through a locked gate?

56:15.579 --> 56:16.946
I don't understand.

56:17.012 --> 56:19.847
Nothing's happening to you
when you tell me this.

56:19.913 --> 56:21.614
Well, that's
because I'm talking to someone

56:21.748 --> 56:23.049
Who also knows the truth.

56:23.115 --> 56:24.815
Now, I wonder what
would happen

56:24.881 --> 56:27.815
If I would try
to tell someone else?

56:34.453 --> 56:38.086
Just to satisfy
my scientific curiosity.

56:38.153 --> 56:39.754
Mm-hm.

56:48.323 --> 56:53.058
Hello? Hello? Hello?

56:55.625 --> 56:57.793
Just as I thought. Dead.

56:57.860 --> 57:00.661
Where is it now, Brewster?

57:00.761 --> 57:03.627
In a cave.
And what does it look like?

57:05.462 --> 57:07.495
I can't describe it.

57:08.763 --> 57:10.765
The hideous part
is it's making the children obey

57:10.765 --> 57:12.298
Its every command.

57:12.365 --> 57:15.465
The children are completely
in its power.

57:17.799 --> 57:20.833
Then we're in the power
of the children.

57:23.168 --> 57:25.102
(Machines whirring)

57:45.841 --> 57:47.276
I'm warning you, doctor.

57:47.342 --> 57:49.410
I can't be held accountable
for what might happen

57:49.477 --> 57:50.878
If you go in there.

57:50.944 --> 57:54.878
I'm ready if you are.
All right.

58:28.856 --> 58:31.824
My life
is more than half over.

58:31.891 --> 58:34.224
The worst you can do to me
is to kill me.

58:34.291 --> 58:37.125
I'm willing to face that,
if I can just know

58:37.192 --> 58:38.393
Why you're here.

58:38.459 --> 58:39.593
Why you've taken
our children

58:39.659 --> 58:41.894
And made them do your work.

58:44.260 --> 58:46.095
I've spent a lifetime
in the search

58:46.161 --> 58:47.962
For truth and knowledge,

58:48.029 --> 58:50.563
Trying to make this world
a better place.

58:50.630 --> 58:52.064
A world
where the very children

58:52.131 --> 58:55.098
You're controlling can live
in peace instead of fear.

58:55.164 --> 58:56.898
I'm their friend.

58:56.964 --> 58:59.265
I beg of you, tell me
what you want of them,

58:59.332 --> 59:00.700
What you're making them do.

59:05.201 --> 59:07.635
Is there no man
on this Earth,

59:07.702 --> 59:11.937
Who has the wisdom and innocence
of a child?

59:18.506 --> 59:21.172
Dave. Better hurry
to the launching.

59:28.910 --> 59:33.143
Number 1 stage.
Primary fuel valve is locked.

59:33.210 --> 59:36.478
Number 2 stage.
Primary fuel valve is locked.

59:36.545 --> 59:39.813
Number 3 stage.
Primary fuel valve, locked.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.148
Are you sure Dr. Wahrman
hasn't called in?

59:46.215 --> 59:48.882
I'm positive.
I've called everywhere.

01:00:12.023 --> 01:00:14.990
MAN (Over speakers):
Transmission, Band A.

01:00:15.057 --> 01:00:18.158
Motor reception, ten by ten.

01:00:18.225 --> 01:00:20.826
Transmission Band B.

01:00:20.892 --> 01:00:23.928
Motor reception, ten by ten.

01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:26.128
(Suspenseful theme playing)

01:00:38.398 --> 01:00:41.599
How did you kids get in here?
We're leaving now.

01:00:41.666 --> 01:00:44.635
Who opened that lock?
Well, we don't know.

01:00:44.701 --> 01:00:47.002
I don't know how you managed
to get past me,

01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:50.236
But I'll give you just
two seconds to get out of here.

01:00:50.302 --> 01:00:52.203
And fast!

01:01:01.505 --> 01:01:04.574
Colonel,
will you initial this?

01:01:08.876 --> 01:01:10.476
I'm afraid we can't wait
for Dr. Wahrman.

01:01:10.543 --> 01:01:11.944
Okay.

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:13.676
How's it look?
Everything's checked out.

01:01:13.743 --> 01:01:14.944
You're positive?
Absolutely.

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:17.077
(Car approaching)

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:26.848
Hey, kids.
Yeah?

01:01:26.881 --> 01:01:29.182
How'd you get in here?
Oh, we just walked in.

01:01:29.249 --> 01:01:30.849
When?
I didn't see you sneak past.

01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:32.050
I know you didn't.

01:01:32.116 --> 01:01:33.750
Come on now, get out of
here, on the double.

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.651
And don't come back now,
you understand?

01:01:35.717 --> 01:01:37.584
EADIE:
Bye.

01:01:39.852 --> 01:01:42.754

Clear the site.

01:02:21.399 --> 01:02:24.434

Optimal tracking report.

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:54.009
Clear for countdown.

01:02:54.076 --> 01:02:56.143
You're just in time,
Dr. Wahrman.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:57.610
Dr. Wahrman,
where have you been?

01:02:57.677 --> 01:02:59.145
You had me worried.
It's all right.

01:02:59.212 --> 01:03:01.313
I can't explain now.
Has everything checked out?

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.113
Everything looks good.

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:07.414

01:04:39.378 --> 01:04:41.312
(Alarm wailing)

01:04:46.946 --> 01:04:48.714
Check all firing
and report instantly.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.980
What could've happened?

01:04:50.048 --> 01:04:52.015
The children have won.
The children?

01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:54.716
You better come along
with us right now.

01:05:20.558 --> 01:05:22.326
Wait there.

01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:26.627
All right, children,
get away.

01:05:26.693 --> 01:05:28.027
Don't come any closer.

01:05:30.361 --> 01:05:32.995
Hello, Dad.
Why did you bring them?

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:35.064
We didn't want them here.

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:37.430
Don't you understand?
Something has to be done.

01:05:37.496 --> 01:05:39.997
MANLEY:
Now, look. Those men
are going inside that cave.

01:05:40.064 --> 01:05:41.165
Not yet.

01:05:41.232 --> 01:05:42.932
There's no use trying
to reason with them.

01:05:42.932 --> 01:05:44.066
They don't understand.
Ken!

01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:45.533
Helen!
What are you doing here?

01:05:45.599 --> 01:05:47.700
Don't get excited.
What are the kids doing here?

01:05:47.766 --> 01:05:50.300
Is that thing in there?
Bud. Ken. For my sake.

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:51.600
Don't worry, Mother.

01:05:51.668 --> 01:05:54.102
Eadie. Eadie, please,
get away from there. I beg you.

01:05:54.169 --> 01:05:56.303
I can't, Mother. Not yet.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.938
Why are you siding
with it against us?

01:05:57.971 --> 01:05:59.604
We're your parents.
We love you.

01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:01.171
WOMAN:
Tim, please, for my sake.

01:06:01.238 --> 01:06:04.005
Children,
I'm your friend.

01:06:04.072 --> 01:06:05.372
And I wouldn't ask you
to do anything

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:07.140
That I didn't feel
was necessary.

01:06:07.206 --> 01:06:09.807
Think of your parents,
the people at the project.

01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:11.942
Your country may be
in terrible danger.

01:06:11.975 --> 01:06:13.342
The Thunderer is useless.

01:06:13.408 --> 01:06:15.509
I don't believe you know
what you've done.

01:06:15.576 --> 01:06:17.944
We know.

01:06:17.977 --> 01:06:19.410
Children, listen.

01:06:19.477 --> 01:06:21.311
Colonel Manley
has a daughter of his own.

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:22.946
I have a son.

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.379
We wouldn't ask you
to do any more

01:06:24.446 --> 01:06:26.112
Than we'd
ask our own children.

01:06:26.179 --> 01:06:28.247
So please get away
from that cave

01:06:28.313 --> 01:06:30.147
And let Colonel Manley
and his men go in.

01:06:30.213 --> 01:06:31.949
All right, men,
move them out of there.

01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:33.750
(Ground rumbling)

01:06:35.016 --> 01:06:37.217
(Dramatic theme playing)

01:06:42.285 --> 01:06:44.052
(All gasp)

01:06:45.953 --> 01:06:48.120
(Screams)

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.055
(Screams)

01:06:57.723 --> 01:06:59.758
Get those kids
out of there!

01:07:26.032 --> 01:07:28.432
I don't understand.

01:07:28.499 --> 01:07:31.234
Why did it
destroy the Thunderer?

01:07:31.301 --> 01:07:34.535
Why? Why?

01:07:34.602 --> 01:07:38.637
It had to, because the world
wasn't ready to do it.

01:07:38.704 --> 01:07:40.370
The world?

01:07:40.436 --> 01:07:42.071
What do you mean, the world?

01:07:42.137 --> 01:07:45.772
The children
all over the world.

01:07:45.838 --> 01:07:49.006
They did what we did
in every country.

01:07:49.073 --> 01:07:51.708
You mean the warheads in Moscow
and Prague and London?

01:07:51.775 --> 01:07:54.541
They're all useless?
Yes.

01:07:54.608 --> 01:07:56.742
(Dramatic theme playing)

01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:03.845
Bud. Do you know
if it'll ever come back again?

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:05.979
I don't know.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.714
I don't know.

01:08:12.982 --> 01:08:16.349
The world
is having a second chance.
