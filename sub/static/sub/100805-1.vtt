WEBVTT

00:47.384 --> 00:48.950
What lens are you on?

00:48.984 --> 00:50.284
Can we get a camera
set up over here?

00:50.317 --> 00:52.384
Thank you, Janine. I'm here at
the New York County Courthouse,

00:52.417 --> 00:55.750
waiting for Lauren Monroe to
give a statement to the press.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.251
Sir, one moment, please.

01:04.417 --> 01:06.717
Set it up over there.
I'll be right there.

01:20.050 --> 01:21.917
Make sure we have full access
to the SEC filings.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.783
Let's get updated lists of
shell companies ASAP as well.

01:24.817 --> 01:26.251
And keep having everyone
comb for discrepancies

01:26.284 --> 01:27.451
in the shareholder reports.

01:27.484 --> 01:28.917
I need a meeting
with Haeven at 2:00.

01:30.884 --> 01:32.984
Please! I can't answer
all your questions at once!

01:33.017 --> 01:35.151
Okay, one at a time.
Katie, go ahead.

01:40.451 --> 01:41.518
What do you say
to those who think

01:41.551 --> 01:44.251
that Wall Street has corrupted
the justice system?

01:44.284 --> 01:46.351
Well, after my first year
as district attorney,

01:46.384 --> 01:48.217
I'd say that my conviction rate
speaks for itself.

01:48.251 --> 01:50.717
Victims and their families have
always been my only concern,

01:50.750 --> 01:52.217
not bankers and brokers.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.950
Beautiful morning,
isn't it, Lauren?

01:58.984 --> 02:00.884
Save your bullshit for the jury.

02:00.917 --> 02:03.950
- It's time we talk plea deal.
- We did. I turned it down.

02:03.984 --> 02:05.884
Is it true that
Thomas Reindorff's legal team

02:05.917 --> 02:07.217
reached out with a plea deal?

02:07.251 --> 02:08.917
A plea deal
without restitution

02:08.949 --> 02:10.883
for the $3.5 billion dollars
he defrauded investors

02:10.917 --> 02:12.783
is no plea deal
I would ever accept.

02:15.717 --> 02:17.683
There's no way
you can prove my client

02:17.717 --> 02:19.750
was aware of
or condoned the actions

02:19.783 --> 02:21.750
- of a few rogue traitors.
- Watch me.

02:21.783 --> 02:23.251
You can rest assured
they'll face their own day

02:23.284 --> 02:25.084
in court for collusion.

02:25.117 --> 02:27.184
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

02:27.217 --> 02:29.750
for District Attorney
Lauren Monroe!

02:29.783 --> 02:31.717
Your brother's running
for reelection to Congress

02:31.750 --> 02:33.050
with less than ten days to go.

02:33.084 --> 02:34.317
A conviction would be
very convenient

02:34.351 --> 02:35.950
in helping the family image.

02:35.984 --> 02:37.850
Thank you, thank you.

02:37.884 --> 02:41.384
My brother has one thing
no other opponent does:

02:41.417 --> 02:42.850
tenacity.

02:42.884 --> 02:45.117
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother,

02:45.151 --> 02:47.084
Congressman William Monroe.

02:47.117 --> 02:49.151
And as far as my brother's
reelection campaign goes,

02:49.184 --> 02:51.683
I'm sure he'd donate blood
in exchange for your vote.

02:53.184 --> 02:55.417
Speaking of the election,
is there any credence

02:55.451 --> 02:57.151
to the New York Post article
that claims your brother

02:57.184 --> 02:58.917
traded favors
in exchange for union support?

02:58.950 --> 03:00.317
Absolutely not.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.151
Desperation
looks good on you, Robert.

03:02.184 --> 03:05.251
Your father would've
told you to take the deal.

03:05.284 --> 03:07.683
Your client
is a sociopathic liar

03:07.717 --> 03:09.917
that defrauded people of
their pensions and life savings.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.917
We're just now getting in word
about your father's accident.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.850
I...

03:17.884 --> 03:20.417
We just received notice
that he was found dead

03:20.451 --> 03:22.917
at your family's summer house.

03:22.950 --> 03:25.417
Can you please comment on your
father's death, Miss Monroe?

03:25.451 --> 03:28.251
Thank you. It's an incredible
honor to be here with you.

03:28.284 --> 03:29.417
Lauren!

03:31.984 --> 03:33.950
One statement about your father!

03:36.317 --> 03:37.884
That'll be all for now.
That's enough!

03:41.017 --> 03:42.850
Jackie, get them out of here!

04:32.417 --> 04:35.984
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

05:13.417 --> 05:16.151
Hey, take care, okay?

05:19.284 --> 05:22.717
Hey, listen, I gotta be back
at the station at 4:00,

05:22.750 --> 05:25.351
but I'm sorry
for your loss, Lauren.

05:27.717 --> 05:30.117
Thanks for all your help,
Emilio.

05:30.151 --> 05:32.117
- Take care, okay?
- Thanks.

05:46.017 --> 05:48.151
You're better at this
than I am.

05:48.184 --> 05:50.950
Well, I had plenty of practice.
You just nod and shake hands.

05:52.984 --> 05:55.317
A heart attack.

05:55.351 --> 05:57.750
I mean, how'd that even happen?

05:57.783 --> 06:01.351
Dad was in better shape
than either of us.

06:01.384 --> 06:03.884
What are we gonna do
about Mom?

06:03.917 --> 06:06.117
Just surround her with friends,

06:06.151 --> 06:09.251
And we'll find her an apartment
on Zillow, closer to us.

06:11.151 --> 06:14.783
Look, I can only stay
until the reading of the will.

06:14.817 --> 06:16.917
Campaign's a circus.

06:19.950 --> 06:22.950
Hey, Dad was proud of you.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.017
Maybe in public,

06:27.050 --> 06:29.717
but we both know
you were the golden child.

06:34.950 --> 06:38.251
Can't believe
it's already been a week.

06:38.284 --> 06:40.683
It's the beginning of the end.

07:44.783 --> 07:47.050
I know how
to play the game.

07:47.084 --> 07:49.317
This game, like life,
requires forethought.

07:49.351 --> 07:51.717
It's not about where you are.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.817
It's where you'll be
in ten moves or ten years.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.850
You are not allowed
to be average.

07:58.884 --> 08:00.417
We all have to put up with
things that we don't like,

08:00.451 --> 08:04.017
so grow up, pick a firm,
and learn how to win.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.284
Checkmate.

08:07.451 --> 08:11.451
"I leave Catherine in sole
control of the family estate

08:11.484 --> 08:14.884
and my voting rights
on the board of directors.

08:14.917 --> 08:17.950
To my son, William,

08:17.984 --> 08:22.217
I leave the sum
of $20 million.

08:22.251 --> 08:26.317
To Lauren, I leave $1 million.

08:26.351 --> 08:29.217
$50 million is to be split

08:29.251 --> 08:34.116
equally between the Police
and Firemen's Benevolent Fund

08:34.150 --> 08:36.150
and the Harvard School
of Medicine.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.150
This is my Last Will
and Testament.

08:39.183 --> 08:40.384
Archer Monroe."

08:40.417 --> 08:42.984
Thank you, Harold.
That'll be all.

08:45.251 --> 08:46.717
I need some air.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.017
Thank you, Harold.

08:52.117 --> 08:55.050
Thank you for everything
you've done for us, Harold.

08:55.084 --> 08:57.117
I know that
you and my dad were close.

09:00.050 --> 09:02.817
There's actually...

09:02.850 --> 09:06.317
something I need
to discuss with you.

09:06.351 --> 09:10.850
Your father left this
for you and you alone.

09:12.251 --> 09:16.084
I knew your father
for 31 years, Lauren.

09:16.117 --> 09:20.084
He was proud of
the woman you became.

09:20.117 --> 09:23.717
Don't let the inheritance
speak otherwise.

09:25.384 --> 09:26.884
Thank you.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.117
Okay.

10:07.050 --> 10:10.317
Lauren, it pains me to do this,

10:10.351 --> 10:12.417
and if you have received this,

10:12.451 --> 10:14.417
it means that I never
found the courage

10:14.451 --> 10:18.783
to tell you
while I was alive or...

10:18.817 --> 10:21.084
I died before
I handled it myself.

10:21.117 --> 10:22.850
And for that...

10:25.783 --> 10:27.950
for many things...

10:29.084 --> 10:30.451
forgive me.

10:30.484 --> 10:32.850
We've all made mistakes.

10:32.884 --> 10:36.151
This was mine.

10:36.184 --> 10:39.251
It is a secret you must
carry to your grave.

10:39.284 --> 10:41.117
You are the eldest,
and as such,

10:41.151 --> 10:44.017
I think you'll understand
why it had to be you.

10:44.050 --> 10:48.151
The answer lies buried
near your fort.

10:48.184 --> 10:50.750
I must be vague
in case of prying eyes,

10:50.783 --> 10:52.717
but above all things...

10:54.451 --> 10:57.251
the truth...

10:57.284 --> 10:59.783
must stay buried.

11:02.117 --> 11:04.783
Deepest apologies.

11:04.817 --> 11:05.850
Dad.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.351
Come on, Ted, how many
years have we know each other?

11:36.384 --> 11:41.884
There is absolutely no truth
whatsoever in the Post article.

11:41.917 --> 11:47.750
Look, my family has always
supported you in the...

11:47.783 --> 11:49.217
Lauren, wait!

11:49.251 --> 11:52.984
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:53.017 --> 11:54.351
Wait.

11:55.484 --> 11:56.783
Are you okay?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.884
What else would I expect?

11:58.917 --> 12:00.184
Do you wanna talk about it?

12:00.217 --> 12:02.017
No, I just...

12:02.050 --> 12:04.351
I just want a moment
by myself.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.151
I'm fine.

12:17.017 --> 12:18.618
I'm fine.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.783
You look
very pretty today.

12:53.850 --> 12:54.817
Two sugar cubes?

12:57.184 --> 12:59.184
Lauren!
This is off-limits.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.184
Jesus!

16:24.850 --> 16:27.384
Okay, okay.

16:56.084 --> 16:58.683
911, what's your emergency?

16:58.717 --> 17:01.084
Hello, hello?

17:10.950 --> 17:12.750
Hello?

17:12.782 --> 17:13.983
Ma'am, we just received a call
from this number.

17:14.017 --> 17:15.251
Is everything all right?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.251
Yeah, sorry, um...

17:17.284 --> 17:20.217
My daughter was playing
with my phone, so...

17:20.251 --> 17:22.782
I won't let it happen again.
I promise.

17:22.817 --> 17:24.884
Okay, ma'am, please be
more careful in the future.

17:27.950 --> 17:29.284
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:29.317 --> 17:31.017
Listen, I don't know
why Dad did that.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.683
Sure you do.

17:32.717 --> 17:34.151
What's wrong with you?
You look awful.

17:34.184 --> 17:35.917
Just got a little queasy
on my walk.

17:35.950 --> 17:37.817
Okay.

17:39.717 --> 17:41.284
Let's split it.

17:41.317 --> 17:45.950
I really, really don't care,
Will, okay? Seriously.

17:45.984 --> 17:48.184
Use it for your campaign
or something.

17:48.217 --> 17:49.750
I hope I still have your vote.

17:49.783 --> 17:51.117
Well, that depends
on your policies.

17:55.484 --> 17:57.217
Weren't you supposed
to be gone already?

17:57.251 --> 17:59.950
Yeah, actually,
but you try pulling Mom away

17:59.984 --> 18:01.417
from her favorite granddaughter.

18:01.451 --> 18:02.950
Lose a hand.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.184
Oh.

18:31.317 --> 18:35.384
We built a beautiful life
together, didn't we?

18:43.917 --> 18:44.850
What's wrong?

18:48.151 --> 18:50.984
It's everything, honestly.

18:51.017 --> 18:53.151
Your father was proud of you.

18:53.184 --> 18:57.184
Even when he didn't show it,
he was proud of you.

19:00.717 --> 19:02.683
I know there's gonna be
blood in the water,

19:02.717 --> 19:04.750
and the press
are gonna be digging,

19:04.783 --> 19:07.817
pointing their spotlight
on all of us.

19:09.451 --> 19:11.317
Are there any old enemies
of Dad's

19:11.351 --> 19:13.050
that I should be aware of?

19:15.050 --> 19:18.351
We both know he was no saint,

19:18.384 --> 19:21.050
but that is not
your burden to carry.

19:21.084 --> 19:22.384
It's mine.

19:22.417 --> 19:26.184
Well, I should know.
Maybe I can help.

19:26.217 --> 19:28.017
You wanna help?

19:28.050 --> 19:30.050
Crucify Reindorff.

19:30.084 --> 19:31.984
Win that case

19:32.017 --> 19:34.917
and help your family
win reelection.

19:47.284 --> 19:49.783
Good night, Claire-Bear.
I love you.

19:49.817 --> 19:52.017
I love you too, Mama.

20:00.384 --> 20:01.850
Sure you don't
want us to stay?

20:01.884 --> 20:04.050
No. I just need some time
to think.

20:04.084 --> 20:05.817
But I'll see you guys
tomorrow night.

20:05.850 --> 20:07.251
- I love you.
- Love you.

20:47.084 --> 20:48.451
All finest schools,

20:48.484 --> 20:50.251
the most prestigious firms
require...

20:50.284 --> 20:52.151
I don't want to represent
your rich friends!

20:52.184 --> 20:54.117
Why is that so wrong?

20:54.151 --> 20:56.284
You are throwing it all
away to be a civil servant,

20:56.317 --> 20:57.451
just like your boyfriend.

20:57.484 --> 20:59.417
FiancÃ©.

20:59.451 --> 21:01.683
Okay, that's enough!

21:01.717 --> 21:04.017
- Both of you.
- Talk to your daughter.

21:04.050 --> 21:05.384
You're acting
like this is

21:05.417 --> 21:07.451
some kind of prison sentence.

21:07.484 --> 21:09.317
It is.

22:21.117 --> 22:22.184
Hey.

22:25.984 --> 22:27.683
Can you hear me?

22:35.351 --> 22:36.750
Hey!

23:05.984 --> 23:07.417
Oh, shit!

23:07.451 --> 23:08.817
Shit.

23:10.184 --> 23:11.284
Shit.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.151
Nice mask.

23:41.217 --> 23:42.950
Who are you?

23:50.917 --> 23:53.017
I like masks.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.783
Answer the question.

23:58.251 --> 23:59.251
Where's Archer?

24:01.117 --> 24:03.084
Tell me your name.

24:07.217 --> 24:08.817
John.

24:08.850 --> 24:10.151
John what?

24:10.184 --> 24:12.417
Doe.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.950
You think this is a game?

24:14.984 --> 24:17.717
You're chained up in a bunker,
and I wanna know why.

24:24.950 --> 24:30.817
Show me your face,
Lauren Elizabeth Monroe.

24:33.017 --> 24:39.817
You want answers?
Look me in the eye and ask.

24:42.817 --> 24:45.251
Born November 7th, 1989.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.151
You have a younger brother,
William.

24:47.184 --> 24:50.717
As DA, you advocate for
the innocent and downtrodden

24:50.750 --> 24:53.417
to appease your conscience
for being born into wealth

24:53.451 --> 24:56.884
and because you knew
your father would disapprove.

24:56.917 --> 24:58.884
You used to bite
your nails incessantly,

24:58.917 --> 25:01.084
unless, of course,
you've kicked that habit.

25:01.117 --> 25:04.284
You have a daughter, Claire,
a husband, Scott,

25:04.317 --> 25:06.717
who you married against
your father's wishes.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.117
Should I continue,

25:08.151 --> 25:11.384
or will you take off
that ridiculous mask?

25:33.050 --> 25:35.017
It's good to finally meet you.

25:35.050 --> 25:36.417
Who are you?

25:38.217 --> 25:40.284
I'd like to think
I'm a member of the family

25:40.317 --> 25:41.750
after all these years.

25:41.783 --> 25:43.251
What do you mean, years?

25:43.284 --> 25:45.117
Exactly that.

25:46.850 --> 25:48.217
Years.

26:02.184 --> 26:06.783
So tell me,
what happened to your dad?

26:09.850 --> 26:11.017
Oh.

26:15.251 --> 26:17.184
How'd he die?

26:20.750 --> 26:23.417
My condolences.

26:27.917 --> 26:32.451
So he left me to you.

26:39.151 --> 26:41.117
That's quite the inheritance.

26:41.151 --> 26:43.151
So explain yourself.

26:43.184 --> 26:46.017
A man in your position,
only bad things come to mind.

26:46.050 --> 26:48.251
Are you good, Lauren?

26:48.284 --> 26:49.351
Who else knows you're here?

26:49.384 --> 26:50.783
Answer the question.

26:50.817 --> 26:51.884
Are you a good person?

26:51.917 --> 26:53.817
I'd like to think so.

26:53.850 --> 26:56.417
Then let me go.

26:56.451 --> 26:58.217
It's what a good person
would do.

26:58.251 --> 27:00.351
You know it's not that simple.

27:00.384 --> 27:03.017
You got a lot to lose.

27:03.050 --> 27:05.351
I have already lost everything.

27:05.384 --> 27:06.917
I need to know why you're here.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.950
Your needs?

27:08.984 --> 27:10.151
Your needs?

27:10.184 --> 27:13.084
You wanna know my name?

27:13.117 --> 27:16.017
You want the truth?

27:16.050 --> 27:21.417
Well, I want the juiciest steak
on God's green Earth.

27:21.451 --> 27:23.683
Rare.

27:23.717 --> 27:26.817
Baked potato, all the fixings.

27:26.850 --> 27:30.717
I want a Caesar salad,
bread and butter,

27:30.750 --> 27:33.184
packet of Gauloises cigarettes,

27:33.217 --> 27:34.451
some chocolate,

27:34.484 --> 27:36.451
a newspaper,

27:36.484 --> 27:38.683
and a 30-year-old
bottle of scotch,

27:38.717 --> 27:42.384
aged for every year
of my captivity.

27:45.417 --> 27:47.783
You give me what I asked for,

27:47.817 --> 27:49.451
and I will tell you everything.

27:49.484 --> 27:51.284
I need answers.

27:51.317 --> 27:54.750
And I need a steak.

27:54.783 --> 27:57.151
And while we're at it,
I want a shave.

27:57.184 --> 28:01.151
I wanna feel more like
a human being again.

28:01.184 --> 28:05.050
Now, we both know your
conscience, though pained,

28:05.084 --> 28:08.351
is not gonna just
let me go, not yet.

28:08.384 --> 28:12.817
But when all is said and done,
you will know the truth,

28:12.850 --> 28:16.050
and you will set me free.

28:16.084 --> 28:19.750
You're really gonna
play it that way?

28:21.151 --> 28:23.817
Look around.
You're the one in chains.

28:23.850 --> 28:25.384
I could just let you
rot in here,

28:25.417 --> 28:27.750
close the door
and walk away.

28:30.284 --> 28:33.184
But you won't.

28:33.217 --> 28:36.850
You really wanna risk that
for a steak?

28:36.884 --> 28:37.850
Wait.

28:45.884 --> 28:50.950
I'd also really like
a slice of key lime pie.

28:50.984 --> 28:54.084
And I would appreciate
that shave.

29:13.850 --> 29:17.317
C-Can I have the light
a little longer?

29:17.351 --> 29:22.783
Your father would only leave it
on an hour or so after he left.

29:38.917 --> 29:42.084
This is Detective
Emilio Sanchez, 75th Precinct.

29:42.117 --> 29:43.717
Leave me a message
and I'll come back to you

29:43.750 --> 29:45.017
as soon as I can.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.750
Sanchez, hey, it's me.

29:46.783 --> 29:48.850
I just emailed you
a set of prints

29:48.884 --> 29:51.417
I need you to get
into the system ASAP.

29:51.451 --> 29:53.417
Call me on my cell. Bye.

30:16.284 --> 30:18.451
Hey, honey. Sorry.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.451
Couldn't connect to you
for some reason.

30:20.484 --> 30:22.184
Hey.

30:22.217 --> 30:23.917
How was last night?

30:23.950 --> 30:25.917
Good, yeah.
I was just going through

30:25.950 --> 30:27.284
some of Dad's old things.

30:27.317 --> 30:28.717
You wanna talk about it?

30:28.750 --> 30:30.251
Maybe tonight.

30:30.284 --> 30:32.351
I'm actually headed
into court right now, so...

30:32.384 --> 30:33.351
Already here.

30:33.384 --> 30:34.717
Don't forget.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.984
Claire's recital
this afternoon.

30:36.017 --> 30:37.417
Yeah, okay.

30:37.451 --> 30:39.750
Well, I love you.

30:39.783 --> 30:40.817
Love you.

30:40.850 --> 30:42.984
Bye.

31:15.451 --> 31:18.683
Ohh...

31:18.717 --> 31:21.984
God help me if that isn't the
finest thing I've ever smelled.

31:22.017 --> 31:24.950
I brought you your food,
so let's talk.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.984
And talk we will.

31:27.017 --> 31:28.217
But first...

31:39.317 --> 31:43.084
Mmm!

31:45.351 --> 31:46.317
Mmm.

31:49.117 --> 31:52.184
You can't imagine
what this means to me.

31:52.217 --> 31:54.717
Thank you.

31:54.750 --> 31:57.251
What happened between
you and my dad?

32:00.217 --> 32:03.084
You're not like him.

32:03.117 --> 32:05.717
I suspect you're better
than he ever was.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.750
You've been deflecting my
questions ever since I got here.

32:08.783 --> 32:11.750
How's Catherine taking this?

32:11.783 --> 32:15.317
She was always
such a beautiful woman.

32:15.351 --> 32:17.317
My family is off-limits.

32:19.950 --> 32:22.850
A lawyer, a banker,
and a politician.

32:22.884 --> 32:25.251
The unholy trinity.

32:25.284 --> 32:26.817
Quite the family.

32:35.984 --> 32:37.984
When I get back,

32:38.017 --> 32:39.984
you're going
to tell me the truth,

32:40.017 --> 32:41.950
or it's the last time
you'll see me.

32:53.950 --> 32:55.184
Lauren, where the hell are you?

32:55.217 --> 32:56.750
Eddie, I'm gonna be
late for court.

32:56.783 --> 32:58.184
I'm sorry, but of
all the days to be late?

32:58.217 --> 32:59.351
Yeah, I know.

32:59.384 --> 33:00.817
Look, I need you
to run the trial.

33:00.850 --> 33:03.084
Haeven is gonna eat me alive.

33:03.117 --> 33:04.783
You're going to be fine.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.750
And don't let Robert
toss the SEC filing on...

33:06.783 --> 33:08.683
I know about the SEC filings.

33:08.717 --> 33:11.384
- I'll be there soon.
- Lauren, Lauren...

33:14.417 --> 33:18.184
1-1/2 cup of finely crushed
Graham crackers,

33:18.217 --> 33:20.817
one-third of a cup of
butter or margarine,

33:20.850 --> 33:22.783
three tablespoons of sugar,

33:22.817 --> 33:25.251
a can of sweetened
condensed milk,

33:25.284 --> 33:27.817
one-half cup
of key lime juice,

33:27.850 --> 33:29.984
one container
of whipped topping.

34:00.417 --> 34:01.917
Let's have some answers.

34:03.484 --> 34:06.084
Forgive me. I just...

34:09.284 --> 34:12.251
Once a year, Christmas,

34:12.284 --> 34:15.783
your father would
bring me chocolate.

34:15.817 --> 34:21.050
Not a whole bar,
just a little tiny square.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.850
It was my one treat
for the year,

34:23.884 --> 34:26.984
then he'd put it up there
for the rest of the year

34:27.016 --> 34:28.150
to taunt me,

34:28.184 --> 34:30.817
along with the pictures he took.

34:30.850 --> 34:31.817
Pictures?

34:31.850 --> 34:33.117
In the cigar box.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.317
What is this?

35:08.351 --> 35:10.084
It's my life.

35:15.384 --> 35:16.783
You, uh...

35:16.817 --> 35:19.084
You want some?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.750
It's all yours.

35:27.351 --> 35:30.351
My name is Morgan.
Morgan Warner.

35:43.284 --> 35:45.050
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:45.084 --> 35:49.717
It's been a long time
since I had any human contact.

35:49.750 --> 35:53.217
You know, just to touch
someone's skin.

36:12.217 --> 36:14.850
I used to smoke Gauloises
cigarettes back in the day.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.251
It was a habit I picked up

36:18.284 --> 36:21.251
because I thought it would
make me appear more refined.

36:22.884 --> 36:25.184
Get to the point.

36:27.217 --> 36:30.817
I was a foolish young man
when I met your father.

36:30.850 --> 36:34.783
We had similar vices.

36:34.817 --> 36:38.050
Gambling, ego, women.

36:38.084 --> 36:40.917
That was the greatest time
of my life.

36:40.950 --> 36:43.284
We became partners.

36:43.317 --> 36:47.117
Archer was fearless,
but he couldn't read people.

36:47.151 --> 36:49.117
He was so young and careless
back then.

36:49.151 --> 36:51.384
So you helped him
become a card shark?

36:51.417 --> 36:53.417
Oh, no, he was already a shark.

36:53.451 --> 36:56.451
I just provided an edge.

36:56.484 --> 36:59.184
If there's one thing
your father wanted

36:59.217 --> 37:02.817
in business, cards, politics,

37:02.850 --> 37:04.117
it was an edge.

37:04.151 --> 37:06.151
What happened between you?

37:09.151 --> 37:11.384
I was gonna become a doctor.

37:14.084 --> 37:17.151
I could've done so much
with my life.

37:19.050 --> 37:20.984
- That night...
- What happened?

37:26.317 --> 37:30.284
We'd had a few drinks
before leaving the summer house

37:30.317 --> 37:33.317
for a big game in the city.

37:33.351 --> 37:35.317
We should never have been
on the road.

37:35.351 --> 37:37.417
I'll never forget that sound.

37:39.484 --> 37:41.084
It happened so fast.

37:43.384 --> 37:46.384
My heart was pounding like it
was gonna burst in my chest.

37:46.417 --> 37:49.017
And my mouth,
I could barely swallow,

37:49.050 --> 37:50.917
I was so scared.

37:53.484 --> 37:56.917
He was just a kid.

37:56.950 --> 37:58.884
He was like us.

38:01.284 --> 38:04.217
I figured the only thing
we could do was call the police

38:04.251 --> 38:06.917
and, you know, say
there had been an accident.

38:06.950 --> 38:08.683
But, uh, he panicked.

38:10.084 --> 38:11.817
He said we couldn't.

38:11.850 --> 38:14.184
He said the cops would be
looking for his dented car.

38:14.217 --> 38:17.917
He said he'd go to jail,
that he'd lose everything.

38:17.950 --> 38:19.950
"If there's no body,
there's no crime.

38:19.984 --> 38:21.384
If there's no body,
there's no crime."

38:21.417 --> 38:23.783
He kept saying it
over and over again.

38:23.817 --> 38:27.050
"If there's no body,
there's no crime."

38:27.084 --> 38:29.750
I-I tried to do
the right thing.

38:29.783 --> 38:31.184
My dad killed a man?

38:31.217 --> 38:33.783
It was an accident.

38:35.917 --> 38:38.317
But paranoia infected him.

38:38.351 --> 38:40.184
What happened to the body?

38:41.384 --> 38:42.717
We buried it.

38:45.017 --> 38:46.750
That is to say,
your father buried it.

38:46.783 --> 38:49.117
I wanted no part of it.

38:49.151 --> 38:52.217
I wasn't about to cover up
a homicide.

38:52.251 --> 38:54.917
You know, I mean,
an accident is one thing, but...

38:57.117 --> 38:58.384
Maybe I should have.

39:00.817 --> 39:02.917
Maybe I'd still have a life.

39:02.950 --> 39:04.317
Morgan!

39:04.351 --> 39:05.783
Who was he?

39:05.817 --> 39:07.184
I don't know.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.184
You buried a body

39:10.217 --> 39:12.351
and didn't even bother
to find out who it was?

39:12.384 --> 39:17.117
I had slightly more pressing
matters at hand.

39:17.151 --> 39:19.251
What would you have done?

39:19.284 --> 39:21.251
Would you have buried him
and walked away,

39:21.284 --> 39:23.750
or would you have made the call
to the police?

39:23.783 --> 39:25.950
I'd like to think
I'd make the call.

39:25.984 --> 39:28.950
Well, then you would
be here like me.

39:28.984 --> 39:32.817
- Why go to all this trouble?
- Why not just kill me?

39:34.084 --> 39:36.284
I begged him to.

39:36.317 --> 39:38.984
Days turned into weeks,
then months,

39:39.017 --> 39:41.117
then so much time had gone by,

39:41.151 --> 39:44.317
he couldn't bring himself
to let me go.

39:44.351 --> 39:47.151
He was scared
I'd turn him in.

39:49.884 --> 39:51.917
I wouldn't have said a word.

39:51.950 --> 39:54.717
Not a word...

39:54.750 --> 39:57.850
if it'd have bought me
my freedom.

39:57.884 --> 39:59.850
If Archer had a conscience,

39:59.884 --> 40:03.017
he would've just
put me out of my misery.

40:03.050 --> 40:07.084
Instead, he offered me
the chance to kill myself.

40:10.117 --> 40:15.084
But no matter the agony,
the hopelessness,

40:15.117 --> 40:18.217
my life had meaning.

40:18.251 --> 40:21.184
My survival
would be my revenge.

40:21.217 --> 40:23.251
But people must have
missed you,

40:23.284 --> 40:25.351
looked for you.

40:27.050 --> 40:30.351
He said I stole his winnings,
left the country.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.984
How do I know that
you're telling me the truth?

40:33.017 --> 40:35.384
It's not like my dad's here
to defend himself.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.984
I said your father
had three vices.

40:40.017 --> 40:42.050
Poker, obviously,

40:42.084 --> 40:44.850
ego, of course,

40:44.884 --> 40:48.251
but we haven't even begun
to discuss the women.

40:48.284 --> 40:49.917
One woman in particular.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.717
What does it have
to do with anything?

40:51.750 --> 40:54.217
You said you could
handle the truth.

40:56.884 --> 41:01.017
Archer loved your mother,
but, uh, Sofia...

41:02.850 --> 41:06.417
she was everything
your mother was not.

41:06.451 --> 41:08.717
Uncomplicated,

41:08.750 --> 41:09.884
unrestrained,

41:09.917 --> 41:12.750
free from conformity.

41:12.783 --> 41:14.950
Sofia wasn't an affair.

41:14.984 --> 41:16.750
She was an obsession,

41:16.783 --> 41:21.184
providing for Archer's
darker appetites.

41:21.217 --> 41:24.251
He used to call her
his Gypsy Rose.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.850
You must have had
some kind of inclination...

41:27.884 --> 41:29.351
I don't believe you.

41:29.384 --> 41:33.317
Why not?
Since the world has turned,

41:33.351 --> 41:35.151
powerful men
have kept mistresses,

41:35.184 --> 41:37.451
and he kept her
till his dying day.

41:37.484 --> 41:39.117
He wouldn't do that to my mom.

41:39.151 --> 41:41.984
Does any daughter
really know her father?

41:43.384 --> 41:45.084
You're lying.

41:45.117 --> 41:47.884
I don't expect you
to take my word for it, okay?

41:47.917 --> 41:50.217
- Why don't you go check?
- How?

41:50.251 --> 41:52.217
He used to visit her
every Tuesday,

41:52.251 --> 41:53.817
72nd and Parkway.

41:53.850 --> 41:56.783
- Her name is Sofia Fiore.
- Bullshit.

41:56.817 --> 41:58.984
If you don't believe me,
go ask Harold.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.750
I'm sure he kept an entirely
separate inheritance for her.

42:02.783 --> 42:07.017
- She was the love of his life.
- Shut the hell up!

42:07.050 --> 42:09.151
If you're lying,

42:09.184 --> 42:11.783
I swear you'll
never see me again.

42:11.817 --> 42:13.251
What if I'm not?

42:53.484 --> 42:55.884
Can you check to see if
there were any missing persons

42:55.917 --> 42:58.117
named Morgan Warner
during the late '80s?

42:58.151 --> 43:00.717
Morgan Warner.
Yeah, okay.

43:00.750 --> 43:02.050
What's it for?

43:02.084 --> 43:04.050
My dad left him something
in his will,

43:04.084 --> 43:06.084
and I'm trying to find out
what happened to him.

43:06.117 --> 43:08.084
No emails.
Just forward whatever you find

43:08.117 --> 43:10.084
on to my parent's
summer house.

43:10.117 --> 43:11.750
All right.

43:35.117 --> 43:37.384
Well, I'm glad you decided
to join us, Ms. Monroe.

43:37.417 --> 43:39.151
May it please the court,

43:39.184 --> 43:41.050
I'd like to offer my sincere
apology to Your Honor

43:41.084 --> 43:43.984
and the ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.

43:52.284 --> 43:54.184
What did I miss?

43:54.217 --> 43:56.750
Besides the birth
of my 15 ulcers?

43:58.950 --> 44:00.351
Court is in session.

44:00.384 --> 44:03.984
Mr. Haeven,
please call your next witness.

44:04.017 --> 44:07.351
1-1/2 cups of finely crushed
Graham crackers,

44:07.384 --> 44:10.717
one-third of a cup of butter,
three tablespoons of sugar,

44:10.750 --> 44:12.717
one can of sweetened
condensed milk,

44:12.750 --> 44:14.783
one-half cup
of key lime juice,

44:14.817 --> 44:16.850
one container
of whipped topping.

44:16.884 --> 44:18.950
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

44:18.984 --> 44:20.950
Press into baking tray.

44:20.984 --> 44:24.451
Bake for eight to 10 minutes.
Leave to cool.

44:24.484 --> 44:27.783
1-1/2 cups of finely crushed
Graham crackers,

44:27.817 --> 44:30.984
one-third of a cup of butter,
three tablespoons of sugar,

44:31.017 --> 44:33.017
one can of sweetened
condensed milk,

44:33.050 --> 44:34.950
one-half cup
of key lime juice,

44:34.984 --> 44:38.750
one container
of whipped topping.

44:38.783 --> 44:42.284
Beat milk and lime juice
together until thick and smooth,

44:42.317 --> 44:46.717
fold in whipped topping,
spoon into cool pie crust,

44:46.750 --> 44:50.683
cover and refrigerate
for one hour or till set.

44:50.717 --> 44:52.950
It's a dessert
the whole family will love.

45:16.017 --> 45:18.384
Can I help you?

45:18.417 --> 45:21.184
I'm here to see Sofia Fiore.

45:21.217 --> 45:22.217
Your name, please?

45:24.417 --> 45:27.050
Lauren Monroe.

45:27.084 --> 45:28.683
One moment, please.

45:32.117 --> 45:35.917
I have Lauren Monroe here
to see you, ma'am.

45:35.950 --> 45:37.050
Yes, ma'am.

45:45.783 --> 45:47.650
Sofia Fiore?

45:50.084 --> 45:52.984
Please come in, Lauren.

45:59.451 --> 46:00.950
Why are you here?

46:03.417 --> 46:05.683
I found your name
in my dad's will.

46:15.451 --> 46:18.451
Maybe you can tell me
how you two met.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.184
Do you really wanna know?

46:22.084 --> 46:23.217
Yes.

46:24.850 --> 46:26.251
At a poker game.

46:27.417 --> 46:30.451
And you were together for...

46:30.484 --> 46:32.850
He never stopped loving your
mother, if that's what you mean.

46:32.884 --> 46:34.917
How long?

46:34.950 --> 46:36.384
Many years.

46:40.384 --> 46:42.384
I wish I didn't have to be here,

46:42.417 --> 46:45.850
but I'm just trying
to put the pieces together.

46:47.184 --> 46:50.950
So I apologize for asking,

46:50.984 --> 46:57.184
but did my dad ever pay you
for your company?

46:57.217 --> 46:59.017
We took care of each other.

46:59.050 --> 47:02.451
That care helped me
earn a master's and a career.

47:02.484 --> 47:05.117
How we started
is not where we ended up.

47:25.950 --> 47:27.884
Who is this?

47:29.117 --> 47:30.451
My son.

47:30.484 --> 47:32.151
Alex.

47:34.251 --> 47:35.683
Your half-brother.

47:38.050 --> 47:39.917
Jesus Christ.

47:42.217 --> 47:43.384
No... No one can know.

47:43.417 --> 47:46.184
This would literally
kill my mom.

47:47.351 --> 47:49.917
Lauren, you came to me.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.251
We have our own life.

47:52.284 --> 47:53.351
And your son?

47:54.850 --> 47:56.783
He doesn't know you exist.

47:59.717 --> 48:01.351
I have to go.

48:47.217 --> 48:49.984
Mm-hmm. Right.

48:54.050 --> 48:56.017
Even for a lawyer, Harold,

48:56.050 --> 48:57.884
you're a goddamn
snake in the grass.

48:58.950 --> 49:01.451
Let me call you back.

49:01.484 --> 49:03.451
Lauren, what the hell
is going on?

49:03.484 --> 49:05.417
Sofia Fiore.

49:08.717 --> 49:10.084
What about her?

49:10.117 --> 49:13.017
All these years, you knew.

49:13.050 --> 49:16.251
Every family gathering,
you lied to our faces.

49:16.284 --> 49:17.950
To my mom's face.

49:17.984 --> 49:19.717
I'm your father's lawyer,
Lauren.

49:19.750 --> 49:21.917
- And his friend.
- And as both,

49:21.950 --> 49:24.151
it wasn't my business
to do either.

49:24.184 --> 49:26.417
You don't think I didn't try
to talk some sense into him?

49:26.451 --> 49:28.750
- What am I supposed to do?
- Walk away.

49:28.783 --> 49:30.284
And if someone finds out?

49:30.317 --> 49:32.117
She won't say a word.
She never has.

49:32.151 --> 49:35.683
She signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

49:35.717 --> 49:38.184
Of course.

49:38.217 --> 49:39.750
How much?

49:39.783 --> 49:41.217
Does it matter?

49:41.251 --> 49:43.351
How much?

49:47.017 --> 49:48.384
What else was my dad hiding?

49:48.417 --> 49:49.683
This is it.

49:49.717 --> 49:51.817
He's dead, Harold!

49:51.850 --> 49:54.050
He's... He's dead.

49:55.117 --> 49:56.850
My mom,

49:56.884 --> 49:59.417
my brother's career,
my career.

49:59.451 --> 50:02.950
I-I need to know
if there are more skeletons.

50:02.984 --> 50:04.284
Nothing that can harm you.

50:04.317 --> 50:06.017
What does that mean?

50:10.351 --> 50:13.284
It means...

50:13.317 --> 50:15.084
walk away.

50:15.117 --> 50:20.117
I've protected your family
for decades.

50:20.151 --> 50:23.117
I know things
I'll take to the grave.

50:24.750 --> 50:26.984
Your father trusted me, Lauren,

50:28.351 --> 50:30.750
I suggest you do the same.

50:41.750 --> 50:45.050
Did my dad ever mention a man
named Morgan Warner to you?

50:46.817 --> 50:48.950
Doesn't sound familiar.

51:05.117 --> 51:07.050
I'd like you
to help me find some stats,

51:07.084 --> 51:09.817
maybe old guarantees.

51:09.850 --> 51:12.184
- Also the research.
- Got it.

51:12.217 --> 51:13.717
- Thanks, Jen.
- Of course.

51:13.750 --> 51:15.251
Hey, Mom.

51:15.284 --> 51:17.683
What a welcome surprise.

51:19.750 --> 51:21.717
You've come to join
the war effort?

51:24.117 --> 51:25.084
Ay.

51:27.384 --> 51:29.251
You know, they have
a speechwriter for that.

51:29.284 --> 51:33.151
Yeah, well, we can't afford
to make the slightest mistake.

51:33.184 --> 51:34.683
Not now.

51:34.717 --> 51:37.117
Not after all this hard work.

51:37.151 --> 51:39.151
- How's your case?
- It's good.

51:39.184 --> 51:41.184
You know, that case
makes me miss being a lawyer.

51:44.084 --> 51:47.251
Listen, I was going through
some of Dad's old things.

51:47.284 --> 51:51.251
Some guy named Morgan Warner,
does that name ring a bell?

51:51.284 --> 51:53.850
Morgan?

51:53.884 --> 51:56.251
I don't think so.

51:56.284 --> 51:58.817
We met so many people. Why?

51:58.850 --> 52:01.717
Oh, I just thought that maybe
I could get to know Dad better

52:01.750 --> 52:03.384
through old friends.

52:03.417 --> 52:05.284
That reminds me.

52:05.317 --> 52:07.351
I have something for you.

52:11.817 --> 52:15.683
I will not let money
tear this family apart.

52:15.717 --> 52:17.084
You deserve the same
as your brother.

52:17.117 --> 52:18.984
I don't want it.
I never did.

52:19.017 --> 52:20.783
Your father had no right
to do what he did.

52:20.817 --> 52:23.717
I don't care you have to do.
Just get it done.

52:23.750 --> 52:25.417
I'm surrounded by jackals.

52:27.217 --> 52:29.084
- Hi.
- What's going on?

52:29.117 --> 52:30.917
Well, we got a sympathy bump
in the polls,

52:30.950 --> 52:33.117
police and firemen's unions
are backing us,

52:33.151 --> 52:34.750
thanks to Dad's donation,

52:34.783 --> 52:37.750
but my lead is within
the margin of error.

52:37.783 --> 52:40.850
Some polls say I'm slipping.

52:40.884 --> 52:43.850
Goddamn New York Post article
saying I paid off union reps

52:43.884 --> 52:45.384
isn't exactly
helping perception.

52:45.417 --> 52:47.050
You didn't, right?

52:47.084 --> 52:49.151
Of course not.
It's a smear campaign.

52:50.850 --> 52:52.050
But, Lauren, listen.

52:52.084 --> 52:54.217
I need you at the rally
tomorrow night.

52:54.251 --> 52:56.783
Just give a short speech,

52:56.817 --> 52:58.683
shake some hands,
kiss a few babies...

52:58.717 --> 53:00.184
It's the worst time.

53:00.217 --> 53:02.317
With the Reindorff case,
I'm barely staying afloat.

53:02.351 --> 53:06.417
I know, but look, it's all hands
on deck right now, okay?

53:06.451 --> 53:08.251
Mom will be there, the mayor.

53:09.917 --> 53:12.117
I need my sister
to get up there,

53:12.151 --> 53:15.783
flash that beautiful smile
and help us win this thing.

53:22.451 --> 53:24.451
I'll be there.

53:24.484 --> 53:26.384
- Thank you, honey.
- Thank you.

53:37.317 --> 53:39.184
Believe me now?

53:39.217 --> 53:40.984
Why didn't you tell me
he had a son?

53:41.017 --> 53:43.884
And ruin the surprise?

53:45.484 --> 53:47.251
How is Alex?

53:47.284 --> 53:48.884
This isn't funny.

53:48.917 --> 53:50.117
No.

53:52.117 --> 53:54.117
But it's proof.

53:59.884 --> 54:02.050
What do you say
we take this off now?

54:04.251 --> 54:06.750
What else, hmm?

54:08.050 --> 54:10.017
What else do you know?

54:10.050 --> 54:12.683
Everything.

54:13.917 --> 54:18.050
I was your father's confessor.

54:18.084 --> 54:21.017
I mean, I hated the man,

54:21.050 --> 54:24.451
yet I lived vicariously
through him.

54:24.484 --> 54:28.451
Each conversation was, uh...

54:28.484 --> 54:29.984
all I had.

54:44.017 --> 54:45.984
Look, I know this is
a lot to swallow,

54:46.017 --> 54:50.817
but truth is, Archer only ever
looked out for Archer.

54:50.850 --> 54:53.984
He was a bad husband,
he's a shitty father,

54:54.017 --> 54:55.284
and a worse friend.

54:55.317 --> 54:56.984
If it's any consolation,

54:57.017 --> 54:59.351
he admired you
for the mother you've become.

54:59.384 --> 55:02.151
I was a good parent
because he wasn't.

55:03.917 --> 55:06.084
It must have been hard.

55:06.117 --> 55:07.950
What?

55:07.984 --> 55:09.984
Trying to please him,

55:10.017 --> 55:12.384
rebel against him
at the same time.

55:14.950 --> 55:18.984
How do I know you're telling
the truth about the body?

55:19.017 --> 55:20.384
Dig it up.

55:20.417 --> 55:22.284
Where's it buried?

55:22.317 --> 55:24.917
I couldn't possibly describe
that to you after all this time.

55:24.950 --> 55:26.117
Try.

55:26.151 --> 55:28.351
The only way
is to take me there.

55:28.384 --> 55:30.317
If you think
that I'm gonna let you...

55:30.351 --> 55:32.151
You're a lawyer.

55:32.184 --> 55:34.184
You know the sentence for aiding
and abetting a kidnapping,

55:34.217 --> 55:36.917
for false imprisonment,
for torture, duress?

55:36.950 --> 55:38.417
I know the law.

55:38.451 --> 55:39.950
Yeah.

55:44.417 --> 55:45.850
No more games.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.717
Tell me the truth.

55:47.750 --> 55:52.050
I told you
the truth about Sofia.

55:52.084 --> 55:55.017
I want my freedom, Lauren.

55:55.050 --> 55:56.783
I've earned it.

55:56.817 --> 55:58.917
Doesn't mean that you're
not lying about this.

55:58.950 --> 56:01.783
Take me there.
Dig up the truth.

56:03.884 --> 56:05.451
If you try something...

56:05.484 --> 56:08.284
I am an old man now.

56:08.317 --> 56:09.884
It's been such a long time

56:09.917 --> 56:11.850
since I've seen
the outside world,

56:11.884 --> 56:14.717
it's probably gonna
give me a heart attack.

56:31.950 --> 56:33.650
Ah...

56:38.817 --> 56:39.817
Move!

57:25.850 --> 57:27.917
It's more beautiful
than I remember.

57:30.783 --> 57:34.717
Oh, God. It's almost
too painful to bear.

57:36.451 --> 57:38.683
- Thank you.
- Come on.

57:38.717 --> 57:42.117
I just... I took so much
for granted, you know.

57:42.151 --> 57:45.384
Just the trees and the...

57:45.417 --> 57:49.384
the night sky, fresh air.

57:49.417 --> 57:51.717
God.

57:54.850 --> 57:56.984
- Let's go, come on.
- Yeah, right, sorry.

57:57.017 --> 57:58.717
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

58:06.750 --> 58:09.817
I'm gonna take this call.
You're not gonna say one word.

58:09.850 --> 58:12.117
You're not even gonna breathe,
do you understand me?

58:12.151 --> 58:13.917
Not one word.

58:17.050 --> 58:19.884
Hey, I've been meaning
to call you.

58:19.917 --> 58:21.251
Where are you?

58:21.284 --> 58:23.151
You haven't returned
my calls or texts.

58:23.184 --> 58:24.884
I left messages at your office.

58:24.917 --> 58:26.984
It's been a horrible day.

58:27.017 --> 58:28.384
I'm sorry.
I should have reached...

58:28.417 --> 58:31.884
You can't just
vanish on me like this.

58:31.917 --> 58:33.284
You remember Claire's recital,

58:33.317 --> 58:35.017
the one you promised
you wouldn't miss?

58:35.050 --> 58:37.884
It's a huge ordeal
to get her to go to bed

58:37.917 --> 58:41.017
because you didn't call back,
you didn't say sorry,

58:41.050 --> 58:42.984
you didn't say good night.

58:43.017 --> 58:47.917
Yeah, look, I know.
I-I total...

58:47.950 --> 58:51.117
I'm sorry. I promise I'll
make it up to you guys, okay?

58:51.151 --> 58:55.017
- Your voice sounds like...
- Look, I can't talk right now!

58:58.050 --> 58:59.884
Trouble at home?

58:59.917 --> 59:02.217
I'm sure Scott's
just missing you.

59:02.251 --> 59:05.817
Goddamn it,
do not talk about my family.

59:05.850 --> 59:07.817
You wanna end up
back in that hole?

59:07.850 --> 59:10.217
- No? Then shut up.
- Okay.

59:10.251 --> 59:11.884
- Move.
- All right.

59:30.451 --> 59:32.184
I feel like
we're driving in circles.

59:32.217 --> 59:34.817
We're almost there.
Just keep going straight.

59:41.850 --> 59:44.084
Oh, oh, here.
Turn down here.

59:44.117 --> 59:46.217
There, just to the right.
Right, right, right.

01:00:07.817 --> 01:00:08.950
How far?

01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:10.984
Just keep going.

01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:13.117
For how long?

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.717
Do you want answers or not?

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.717
We're close.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.984
We're almost there,
I'm telling ya.

01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:31.950
Oh, stop.

01:00:31.984 --> 01:00:33.683
Stop the car.

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:41.251
Take this.

01:00:43.984 --> 01:00:44.984
Morgan.

01:00:46.151 --> 01:00:47.417
Morgan!

01:00:55.783 --> 01:00:59.317
There.
That's where we buried him.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:02.151
Sit over there
and keep lying on the ground.

01:01:02.184 --> 01:01:05.117
You move, I shoot.
It's that simple.

01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:07.417
You sure you don't
want me to dig?

01:01:09.217 --> 01:01:10.284
Your dad did.

01:01:10.317 --> 01:01:12.750
I prefer you in cuffs.

01:01:12.783 --> 01:01:14.017
Suit yourself.

01:01:15.317 --> 01:01:17.850
- When you find the body...
- If!

01:01:17.884 --> 01:01:20.917
- When you find the body...
- Shut up! I mean it.

01:01:22.217 --> 01:01:23.850
All right.

01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:51.284
There's nothing here.

01:01:51.317 --> 01:01:52.850
Oh, he's there.

01:01:52.884 --> 01:01:55.984
Where, huh? Where?

01:01:56.017 --> 01:01:57.384
Okay, this is all
some bullshit lie.

01:01:57.417 --> 01:01:58.850
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

01:01:58.884 --> 01:02:00.717
Please, just trust me.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.984
How can I trust you?
I don't even know you, okay?

01:02:04.017 --> 01:02:06.750
I'm already out
on a fucking limb, trying...

01:02:13.117 --> 01:02:14.217
Light.

01:02:28.184 --> 01:02:29.351
Jesus Christ.

01:02:36.184 --> 01:02:37.184
Told ya.

01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:42.184
Shut up!

01:03:29.184 --> 01:03:31.084
So what happens now?

01:03:31.117 --> 01:03:32.750
Put the collar back on.

01:03:33.884 --> 01:03:35.217
W-We found the body.

01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:36.683
I need to think.

01:03:38.084 --> 01:03:40.417
About what? I'm...
I'm innocent.

01:03:40.451 --> 01:03:42.683
It's not that black or white.

01:03:42.717 --> 01:03:45.017
I see, I see.

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:47.384
Even now you are
protecting your father.

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:49.251
Not my father. My family.

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:51.683
What about justice?

01:03:51.717 --> 01:03:53.984
Isn't that why you
became a lawyer?

01:03:54.017 --> 01:03:56.251
What about everything I've lost?

01:03:56.284 --> 01:03:59.984
What about my mother, huh?

01:04:00.017 --> 01:04:03.850
Her son just vanishes
off the face of the Earth?

01:04:03.884 --> 01:04:07.384
No closure?
Not even a funeral?

01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:09.817
It's just there's no love
or compassion,

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:11.984
not even a window
to see the sun.

01:04:12.017 --> 01:04:15.317
Every day, protein powder,
peanut butter and water.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.384
Could you live like that?!

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:19.417
Could you?

01:04:19.451 --> 01:04:22.417
Days that last as long as years!
Nothing to celebrate!

01:04:22.451 --> 01:04:25.184
Just one fucking piece of
chocolate every Christmas!

01:04:25.217 --> 01:04:27.917
What do you want me to say?
I didn't do this to you!

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:30.351
But you could change it!

01:04:30.384 --> 01:04:33.084
If you walk away,
you're worse than he is.

01:04:33.117 --> 01:04:36.284
Will you be able
to look into Scott's eyes?

01:04:36.317 --> 01:04:38.151
Or Claire's? Or yours?

01:04:38.184 --> 01:04:39.417
Put it back on!

01:04:39.451 --> 01:04:41.451
I am an innocent man.

01:04:41.484 --> 01:04:43.451
You give me my life back.

01:04:43.484 --> 01:04:44.850
Put it on!

01:04:44.884 --> 01:04:47.084
- All right, all right.
- Put it on.

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:49.417
This is not my responsibility,
do you understand me?

01:04:49.451 --> 01:04:50.850
I didn't ask for this.

01:04:50.884 --> 01:04:53.151
This is not my fault.

01:04:53.184 --> 01:04:54.783
You think just because
you show me a body,

01:04:54.817 --> 01:04:56.151
and you told me
about his mistress

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.984
that that means I believe you,
and I trust you?

01:04:59.017 --> 01:05:01.317
It doesn't prove anything.

01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:02.417
It doesn't prove anything!

01:05:02.451 --> 01:05:04.950
It proves everything!

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.184
- Come on.
- I need more.

01:05:07.217 --> 01:05:09.750
What do you want from me,
to just conjure evidence?

01:05:09.783 --> 01:05:13.184
Your father erased
every trace of my existence!

01:05:13.217 --> 01:05:14.384
You gotta give me
something else!

01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:18.151
I can't! I can't!

01:05:18.184 --> 01:05:21.284
Goddamn it!
You're just like your father!

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:25.117
You offer false hope, and then
you just take it all away.

01:05:28.017 --> 01:05:30.451
God knows how many good years
I've got, Lauren.

01:05:30.484 --> 01:05:32.984
Just, please, let me have them.

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:38.084
Oh, God.

01:05:38.117 --> 01:05:39.084
All right.

01:05:55.817 --> 01:05:58.417
Look, I know what
you're thinking, okay?

01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:00.984
And I understand.

01:06:01.017 --> 01:06:02.683
"If I set him free,

01:06:02.717 --> 01:06:05.317
is he gonna go to the cops
or the media?

01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:07.717
Is he gonna destroy
my family name?

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:11.151
My brother's political career?
My career?

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:12.917
Am I gonna break
your mother's heart?"

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:17.050
I swear, I swear
I will just, I will vanish.

01:06:17.084 --> 01:06:20.717
I just wanna salvage
what few years I have left.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.750
Please, please, Lauren.

01:06:23.783 --> 01:06:25.184
Be a good person.

01:06:25.217 --> 01:06:27.850
I beg you.

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:29.351
I beg you.

01:06:45.717 --> 01:06:46.884
Thank you.

01:06:48.451 --> 01:06:49.850
Thank you.

01:06:58.351 --> 01:06:59.650
I'm sorry.

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.251
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:07:04.351 --> 01:07:05.884
I'm sorry.

01:07:07.783 --> 01:07:09.017
I'm sorry.

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:09.984
No.

01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:18.317
Lauren!

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:24.750
Pick up, pick up!

01:07:27.717 --> 01:07:30.084
All you two care about
is money and legacy.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.251
I know that it's late,
but I really need

01:07:36.284 --> 01:07:37.351
that missing persons
information ASAP, okay?

01:07:37.384 --> 01:07:38.351
What's going on with that?

01:07:38.384 --> 01:07:39.351
I don't have it yet.

01:07:40.417 --> 01:07:42.017
Show me your face.

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:45.084
Privilege is not given.
It's earned.

01:07:45.117 --> 01:07:46.950
I know exactly
the kind of person it takes

01:07:46.984 --> 01:07:48.717
to earn your privilege.

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:50.884
A lawyer, a banker,
and a politician.

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:53.251
- It's in a warehouse in Queens.
- Fuck!

01:07:53.284 --> 01:07:55.217
The unholy trinity.

01:07:55.251 --> 01:07:56.683
I want my freedom.

01:07:58.417 --> 01:08:00.950
Send the hard copy file
to the Monroe manor.

01:08:00.984 --> 01:08:03.017
Dad, say something.

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:05.917
Close the door
on your way out.

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.917
It is protected,
and it has a price.

01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:12.317
Quite the family.

01:08:12.351 --> 01:08:13.351
Checkmate.

01:09:21.817 --> 01:09:24.050
I'm so sorry, Claire-bear.

01:09:25.716 --> 01:09:27.350
I love you.

01:09:27.384 --> 01:09:29.783
I love you too, Mommy.

01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:51.683
The congressional
race is in a dead heat.

01:09:51.716 --> 01:09:53.283
With only two days to go,

01:09:53.317 --> 01:09:55.451
each candidate is pulling out
all the stops.

01:09:55.484 --> 01:09:57.050
Incumbent William Monroe

01:09:57.084 --> 01:09:59.050
is trying to lock down
his second term

01:09:59.084 --> 01:10:01.184
in the face of allegations
that his campaign

01:10:01.217 --> 01:10:03.451
has been trading favors
for union vo...

01:10:26.717 --> 01:10:29.117
Bring me up to speed
before we begin.

01:10:29.151 --> 01:10:31.117
Here's the updated list
of shell companies

01:10:31.151 --> 01:10:32.950
from forensic accounting.

01:10:35.217 --> 01:10:37.017
Give me the highlights.

01:10:40.451 --> 01:10:41.417
All rise!

01:10:47.484 --> 01:10:49.417
Please be seated.

01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:51.251
To be very clear
for the jury,

01:10:51.284 --> 01:10:53.884
confirm how many traders worked
on behalf of their clients,

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:55.417
in full control
of their own accounts,

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.984
outside of Mr. Reindorff's
direct supervision?

01:10:58.017 --> 01:11:00.917
- 324.
- 324.

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.850
And how many trades a day
were completed on average

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:05.151
by these 324 traders?

01:11:05.184 --> 01:11:07.151
Around 2,500.

01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:10.783
- 2,500 trades a day?
- That's correct.

01:11:10.817 --> 01:11:12.384
I further put it to you
that Ms. Monroe,

01:11:12.417 --> 01:11:14.050
desperate to step out
of her late father's shoes...

01:11:16.783 --> 01:11:19.151
She's dragging my client's
impeccable reputation

01:11:19.184 --> 01:11:20.384
through the mud.

01:11:20.417 --> 01:11:22.084
The state should be
ashamed of her.

01:11:27.184 --> 01:11:28.850
Your witness, Ms. Monroe.

01:11:29.917 --> 01:11:31.984
Ms. Monroe?

01:11:32.017 --> 01:11:33.151
Ms. Monroe!

01:11:34.484 --> 01:11:36.284
No questions, Your Honor.

01:11:36.317 --> 01:11:38.984
In that case,
this court is adjourned

01:11:39.017 --> 01:11:41.451
until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

01:11:41.484 --> 01:11:43.351
The witness
is free to step down.

01:11:43.384 --> 01:11:44.950
I'll call you later.

01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:54.717
You don't call ahead anymore?

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:56.151
Did you set up the account?

01:11:56.184 --> 01:12:00.217
- What is this?
- Gypsy Rose, LLC.

01:12:00.251 --> 01:12:01.284
I'm not at liberty...

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.284
Stop!

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:03.417
I don't wanna hear it.

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:04.850
I can't hear it.

01:12:04.884 --> 01:12:06.351
This is a major
conflict of interest!

01:12:06.384 --> 01:12:08.084
My own father
is a co-conspirator

01:12:08.117 --> 01:12:09.850
in my goddamn case.

01:12:09.884 --> 01:12:12.884
- Lauren...
- Jesus Christ, Harold!

01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:15.351
I asked you if there was
anything else

01:12:15.384 --> 01:12:16.683
that could hurt us,

01:12:16.717 --> 01:12:19.084
and you said no.
You said...

01:12:19.117 --> 01:12:23.084
Stop asking questions
you don't want answers to!

01:12:23.117 --> 01:12:25.783
Lauren, ignorance
is deniability,

01:12:25.817 --> 01:12:27.683
so walk away.

01:12:27.717 --> 01:12:29.917
I don't know anything
about Gypsy Rose,

01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:32.017
and neither do you.

01:12:37.984 --> 01:12:39.683
Just get
that proposal on my desk

01:12:39.717 --> 01:12:41.783
and set up a meeting
with the labor board, please.

01:12:41.817 --> 01:12:42.984
No later than Friday.

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:45.317
Hey.

01:12:45.351 --> 01:12:47.850
What are you doing here?

01:12:49.251 --> 01:12:50.750
Is everything okay?

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.351
Yeah, I, um...

01:12:52.384 --> 01:12:55.151
- I just needed some advice.
- About the Reindorff case?

01:12:55.184 --> 01:12:57.050
No, I have a legal situation
I need to talk through.

01:12:57.084 --> 01:12:59.683
Oh, okay. Well, hit me.

01:12:59.717 --> 01:13:01.850
The details are complicated,
but the gist is this.

01:13:01.884 --> 01:13:04.117
A guy has blackmail material
that could ruin your life,

01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:06.750
ruin your family's life,
destroy everything you've built.

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:08.817
He just needs some money
to start a new life.

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:12.683
Whatever it takes.
Family comes first.

01:13:12.717 --> 01:13:14.284
Before a clear conscience?

01:13:14.317 --> 01:13:16.050
Well, yeah, in our business,

01:13:16.084 --> 01:13:18.117
that's rarer
than the virgin birth.

01:13:19.251 --> 01:13:20.950
Okay, say I'm that guy.

01:13:20.984 --> 01:13:22.417
What did I do?

01:13:22.451 --> 01:13:23.683
Hypothetically?

01:13:23.717 --> 01:13:25.284
- Hypothetically.
- Okay.

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:27.451
Well, you know
the guy killed a man,

01:13:27.484 --> 01:13:29.284
and you are threatening
to expose him.

01:13:29.317 --> 01:13:31.850
Just plead him out
or walk away.

01:13:31.884 --> 01:13:35.850
It's not like you're ever
gonna run out of cases to try.

01:13:35.884 --> 01:13:38.050
Okay.

01:13:38.084 --> 01:13:41.750
Look, all I know is,

01:13:41.783 --> 01:13:44.984
if someone was threatening
our family,

01:13:45.017 --> 01:13:48.750
I'd either pay him off
or dump his body in the river.

01:13:50.484 --> 01:13:53.117
And you know
what Dad would've done.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:44.117
Have you made your decision?

01:14:53.351 --> 01:14:56.717
Lauren... please.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:57.750
I wanna do the right thing.

01:14:57.783 --> 01:14:59.317
- I really do.
- But?

01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:00.783
But how do I know
that you're telling the truth?

01:15:00.817 --> 01:15:02.683
I showed you the body.

01:15:02.717 --> 01:15:04.984
The truth about vanishing.

01:15:06.817 --> 01:15:11.451
I have been imprisoned
in this room

01:15:11.484 --> 01:15:14.417
for longer than
you have been alive.

01:15:16.451 --> 01:15:20.317
If I walk out that door,

01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:24.017
I will never, ever look back.

01:15:25.717 --> 01:15:26.950
I have your word?

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:32.417
I swear.

01:16:03.484 --> 01:16:04.717
Clean up.

01:16:06.184 --> 01:16:07.984
You're leaving tonight.

01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:27.717
- Why are we meeting here?
- We have a situation.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.717
- What happened?
- My father happened.

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:31.384
I told you,
Sofia isn't a concern.

01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:33.017
And that other issue...

01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:34.917
I need you to set up
a Cayman Islands account.

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:36.417
You're good at that.

01:16:36.451 --> 01:16:39.151
Put my one million in it,
and I need 100K in cash.

01:16:40.217 --> 01:16:41.251
Who's this for?

01:16:41.284 --> 01:16:43.050
A man my dad wronged.

01:16:43.084 --> 01:16:45.683
In addition, I need an ID,
fake or otherwise,

01:16:45.717 --> 01:16:47.417
and I need to charter a jet
to fly him there.

01:16:47.451 --> 01:16:49.384
Make sure none of this
is traceable back to us.

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:50.984
Hey, hold on, hold on.

01:16:51.017 --> 01:16:53.451
I've done plenty of
shady things in my life,

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:56.717
but I always knew the reason.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:57.850
Give me a reason.

01:16:57.884 --> 01:16:59.451
You don't wanna know.

01:16:59.484 --> 01:17:01.050
On a scale of one to 10.

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:03.284
Apocalyptic.

01:17:03.317 --> 01:17:04.884
Who else knows about this?

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:06.184
William? Catherine?

01:17:06.217 --> 01:17:07.750
No one else knows.

01:17:07.783 --> 01:17:09.251
I need it done ASAP.

01:17:09.284 --> 01:17:11.351
I have to get this man
as far away from us as possible.

01:17:11.384 --> 01:17:13.151
- What did Archer do...
- I can't tell you!

01:17:13.184 --> 01:17:14.451
I can't tell anyone.

01:17:14.484 --> 01:17:18.084
Lauren, are you sure
you wanna do this?

01:17:18.117 --> 01:17:19.251
That's a lot of loose ends.

01:17:19.284 --> 01:17:22.217
I don't have a choice!

01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:23.950
Call me when it's set.

01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:41.317
I feel like a new man.

01:17:41.351 --> 01:17:44.117
You look... different.

01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:47.251
I will take that
as the compliment.

01:17:47.284 --> 01:17:49.950
I'm sure it was
grudgingly meant to be.

01:17:52.484 --> 01:17:57.017
When you talked, um...

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:59.683
what did my dad say about me?

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.184
What do you mean?

01:18:01.217 --> 01:18:06.017
Well, you said that
you were his confessor, so...

01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:07.817
so what did he say?

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.384
He was proud of you.

01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:12.717
The truth.

01:18:15.017 --> 01:18:17.683
He thought you should be
in the private sector

01:18:17.717 --> 01:18:19.184
as a litigator,

01:18:19.217 --> 01:18:21.384
protecting
the family interests.

01:18:21.417 --> 01:18:25.817
A city attorney lacked prestige.

01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:27.417
Then when you made DA,

01:18:27.451 --> 01:18:29.151
he thought you were
humiliating him

01:18:29.184 --> 01:18:32.217
by going after his friends.

01:18:32.251 --> 01:18:34.884
But he loved you...

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:36.417
in his way.

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:41.817
And he would read me
every story

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.950
when you had some trial
in the news.

01:18:44.984 --> 01:18:48.351
I think after a time,

01:18:48.384 --> 01:18:50.917
he began to change his mind
about things.

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:53.217
I thought that I would
make him proud if I became DA,

01:18:53.251 --> 01:18:55.084
but, you know.

01:18:55.117 --> 01:18:57.284
Least you didn't have to pay off
the unions for support.

01:18:57.317 --> 01:19:00.417
That's a smear campaign.
My brother didn't do that.

01:19:00.451 --> 01:19:03.884
I'm sure Jeffrey Shultz
would disagree,

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:07.817
if he isn't already lying
in a ditch somewhere.

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:10.017
Who's Jeffrey Shultz?

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:14.950
Can you just keep me
updated on the polls

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:16.284
as they come through,
point-for-point?

01:19:16.317 --> 01:19:17.351
That'd be great.

01:19:17.384 --> 01:19:19.251
1-1/2 cups

01:19:19.284 --> 01:19:22.151
of finely crushed
Graham crackers.

01:19:22.184 --> 01:19:25.217
Three tablespoons of sugar.

01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:27.717
One can of sweetened
condensed milk.

01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:29.317
Oh, and I need the most
recent draft of my speech

01:19:29.351 --> 01:19:30.451
within the hour
to make the edits.

01:19:30.484 --> 01:19:32.017
Thank you.

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:34.050
One-third of a cup of
butter or margarine.

01:19:34.084 --> 01:19:35.917
Three tablespoons of sugar.

01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:38.884
One-third of a cup of
butter or margarine.

01:19:38.917 --> 01:19:40.351
Three tablespoons of sugar.

01:19:40.384 --> 01:19:42.284
One can of sweetened
condensed milk.

01:19:42.317 --> 01:19:44.284
Oh, hey.

01:19:44.317 --> 01:19:45.817
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to ask you if you...

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:48.084
We need to talk.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:50.184
In private.

01:19:50.217 --> 01:19:52.251
Yeah, okay.

01:19:52.284 --> 01:19:55.017
Uh, guys, can we get a minute?
Thank you.

01:19:58.783 --> 01:19:59.817
What's wrong?

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:01.817
Jeffrey Shultz.

01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:03.984
Does that name sound familiar?

01:20:04.017 --> 01:20:04.984
No. Why?

01:20:05.017 --> 01:20:06.950
Oh, save the bullshit!

01:20:06.984 --> 01:20:09.717
That article,
it's legit, isn't it?

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.184
You and Dad
cut a deal for the votes

01:20:11.217 --> 01:20:12.817
and used Jeffrey Shultz
as the middleman

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:15.251
to pay union reps?

01:20:15.284 --> 01:20:16.884
They can't prove it.

01:20:16.917 --> 01:20:20.050
Oh, Jesus Christ.
What the hell were you thinking?

01:20:20.084 --> 01:20:22.417
Oh, stop with
the choir girl act, Lauren!

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:24.117
Don't play dumb.

01:20:24.151 --> 01:20:25.884
You know how this works.

01:20:25.917 --> 01:20:27.884
You think anyone gets elected
without cutting deals?

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:29.750
It's bribery!

01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:32.117
You and Dad were lying to me.

01:20:32.151 --> 01:20:34.850
How many? For how long, huh?
Why didn't I know?

01:20:34.884 --> 01:20:36.917
'Cause you're the
district attorney of Manhattan.

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:39.151
- I'm your sister!
- We were protecting you.

01:20:39.184 --> 01:20:41.817
Would you really have
wanted to know? Honestly.

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:43.884
Do you even know the position
that would've put you in?

01:20:43.917 --> 01:20:46.351
I wouldn't have liked it,
but I would have protected you.

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:49.017
- I am protecting you.
- Yeah? Who'd you talk to?

01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:52.184
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh, the hell it doesn't.

01:20:52.217 --> 01:20:55.717
How do you think
you got elected as the DA?

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.151
Because I can assure you,
it wasn't your...

01:20:58.184 --> 01:21:00.184
Shut up!

01:21:00.217 --> 01:21:01.717
Don't you dare.

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:04.117
Don't you dare ever lie
to me again!

01:21:14.217 --> 01:21:17.217
Are you ready?

01:21:17.251 --> 01:21:19.917
With every fiber of my being.

01:23:15.284 --> 01:23:18.984
I can't wait to see the sunrise,

01:23:19.017 --> 01:23:20.850
feel it on my face.

01:23:20.884 --> 01:23:23.317
You'll have all the sun
you want in the Caymans.

01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:24.717
It's paradise.

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:43.384
Harold, right?

01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:45.317
He'll help you set up
a new life.

01:23:45.351 --> 01:23:47.884
You can make up for lost time.

01:23:47.917 --> 01:23:51.884
This might sound
a little strange, but, um...

01:23:51.917 --> 01:23:55.683
this is one of the things
that really kept me going.

01:23:55.717 --> 01:24:00.984
I promised myself that if
one day I got free, I'd, um...

01:24:01.017 --> 01:24:03.884
have myself a slice
of key lime pie,

01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:06.417
like the one in the picture.

01:24:13.117 --> 01:24:14.783
I'm sorry.

01:24:17.251 --> 01:24:19.050
You didn't deserve this.

01:24:21.451 --> 01:24:23.384
You're a good person, Lauren.

01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:26.384
Thank you.

01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:35.317
Morgan, just one last thing.

01:24:38.151 --> 01:24:41.451
If you ever come back,
if you ever say a word,

01:24:41.484 --> 01:24:45.084
I will pin every cold case
for the last 30 years on you.

01:24:45.117 --> 01:24:46.917
I will make you wish
you were back in the hole

01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:48.184
my dad kept you in.

01:24:48.217 --> 01:24:49.184
Are we clear?

01:24:59.317 --> 01:25:01.984
- Hey, my name is...
- No names.

01:25:02.017 --> 01:25:04.217
Here are your new IDs,

01:25:04.251 --> 01:25:05.451
100,000 in cash

01:25:05.484 --> 01:25:07.717
and an account number
with $1 million.

01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:33.817
Let's go.

01:26:18.251 --> 01:26:21.151
Lauren, this is Sanchez.

01:26:21.184 --> 01:26:24.084
I found that missing person
file you needed.

01:26:24.117 --> 01:26:26.451
Those fingerprints
came back with a match.

01:26:26.484 --> 01:26:28.783
I'm sending it all up
to the summer house now.

01:26:28.817 --> 01:26:30.017
Call me.

01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:34.950
Thank you, Tom.

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:04.050
Lauren?

01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:15.950
Shit! Shit!

01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:22.084
Mom?

01:27:25.317 --> 01:27:26.317
Mom!

01:27:29.217 --> 01:27:30.184
Mom!

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:37.850
Mom, what are you doing?

01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:41.217
What is this?

01:27:41.251 --> 01:27:42.817
It's nothing.
It's just a work thing.

01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:44.184
Why do you have pictures
of this man?

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:46.117
Why are you asking about Morgan?

01:27:46.151 --> 01:27:48.950
Morgan?

01:27:48.984 --> 01:27:51.217
This man's name is Carson.

01:27:51.251 --> 01:27:53.284
No, it's... it's Morgan.

01:27:54.917 --> 01:27:55.884
That's Morgan!

01:27:55.917 --> 01:27:58.284
His name is Carson.

01:27:58.317 --> 01:28:00.251
I...

01:28:00.284 --> 01:28:01.284
I don't understand.

01:28:02.384 --> 01:28:03.683
That's...

01:28:05.850 --> 01:28:06.917
What's going on?

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:08.184
Do you know him?

01:28:08.217 --> 01:28:11.984
Why do you have any of this?

01:28:12.017 --> 01:28:13.984
This man.

01:28:14.017 --> 01:28:16.284
This man said his
name was Morgan

01:28:16.317 --> 01:28:18.284
and that Dad's kept
this man chained up

01:28:18.317 --> 01:28:20.917
in a bunker in our backyard!

01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:22.451
In our backyard, okay?

01:28:22.484 --> 01:28:27.884
This, this is my fucking
inheritance, Mom!

01:28:27.917 --> 01:28:31.817
This man is evil.

01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:34.783
He's... He's pure evil.

01:28:34.817 --> 01:28:36.884
What?

01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:38.850
Where is he now?
Where is he?

01:28:38.884 --> 01:28:41.050
I...

01:28:41.084 --> 01:28:42.117
I let him go.

01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:46.683
I let him go. I...

01:28:46.717 --> 01:28:48.317
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:50.884
I thought I was doing
the right thing, Mom!

01:28:50.917 --> 01:28:53.317
I called Harold, and I...

01:28:53.351 --> 01:28:55.384
- Oh, my God.
- You lock the doors.

01:28:55.417 --> 01:28:57.050
I'll handle this.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:00.384
I'll handle it.

01:29:02.417 --> 01:29:03.884
This is Harold Thewlis.

01:29:03.917 --> 01:29:05.717
I'm unavailable right now.

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:08.750
Please leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:38.084
Oh, my God.

01:29:38.117 --> 01:29:39.850
Oh, my God.

01:29:43.817 --> 01:29:45.683
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:29:45.717 --> 01:29:48.317
Mom, pick up, pick up.

01:29:48.351 --> 01:29:52.017
Hey there.
You know what to do.

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:54.417
Mom, get out of the house now!
He's there!

01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:56.917
He's there, he's there!

01:30:00.317 --> 01:30:01.683
Mom!

01:30:10.451 --> 01:30:12.117
Mom!

01:30:20.084 --> 01:30:21.217
Mom!

01:30:25.717 --> 01:30:26.884
Mom!

01:31:10.484 --> 01:31:12.050
Mom.

01:31:12.084 --> 01:31:13.451
Mom, can you hear me?

01:31:13.484 --> 01:31:15.884
Mom, we have to
get out of here, Mom.

01:31:15.917 --> 01:31:18.251
Come on. Mom!
Mom, can you hear me?

01:31:18.284 --> 01:31:21.984
Mom, we have to get out of here.
Please, you have to get up.

01:31:22.017 --> 01:31:22.984
Lauren.

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.050
Shit.

01:31:43.984 --> 01:31:45.384
Lauren.

01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:54.917
Lauren!

01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:58.683
You would be amazed

01:31:58.717 --> 01:32:01.251
at how well your eyes
and ears adjust

01:32:01.284 --> 01:32:05.251
after years
in near total darkness.

01:32:05.284 --> 01:32:07.850
I can hear your heartbeat.

01:32:10.417 --> 01:32:11.351
Thump.

01:32:14.484 --> 01:32:15.417
Thump.

01:32:17.417 --> 01:32:18.783
Thump.

01:32:20.217 --> 01:32:21.151
Thump!

01:33:11.251 --> 01:33:16.217
1-1/2 cups of finely crushed
Graham crackers.

01:33:16.251 --> 01:33:19.117
Three tablespoons of sugar.

01:33:19.151 --> 01:33:23.451
1-1/2 cup of finely crushed
Graham crackers.

01:33:23.484 --> 01:33:27.950
One-third of a cup of
butter or margarine.

01:33:27.984 --> 01:33:30.251
Three tablespoons of sugar.

01:33:31.817 --> 01:33:34.384
Hey there, sleepy head.

01:33:35.817 --> 01:33:39.151
Parting was unbearable.

01:33:39.184 --> 01:33:41.084
I really didn't wanna
start without you,

01:33:41.117 --> 01:33:44.084
but your mother insisted.

01:33:44.117 --> 01:33:46.417
I swear to God,
I'll tear your heart out.

01:33:46.451 --> 01:33:50.084
I'm kinda sorry that it's not
your dad there in chains.

01:33:50.117 --> 01:33:54.984
It took me so long to get
my hands on him, you know?

01:33:55.017 --> 01:33:59.284
All my little traps
finally worked to perfection.

01:33:59.317 --> 01:34:02.384
I took some of the poison
he got to kill me,

01:34:02.417 --> 01:34:04.850
I jammed it in his hand
when we're playing chess.

01:34:04.884 --> 01:34:07.017
Checkmate.

01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:08.884
I got my rat.

01:34:08.917 --> 01:34:10.217
Then the slippery bastard
got away,

01:34:10.251 --> 01:34:12.850
and I was like,
"Oh, fuck!"

01:34:12.884 --> 01:34:16.717
And just when all hope
seemed to be lost...

01:34:19.384 --> 01:34:23.084
imagine my surprise
when you walked in.

01:34:23.117 --> 01:34:26.251
I knew the moment I saw ya.

01:34:26.284 --> 01:34:29.984
That little girl
takes in stray dogs.

01:34:30.017 --> 01:34:32.683
She's gonna do the same for me.
I just...

01:34:35.384 --> 01:34:38.850
I just needed to act weak...

01:34:40.084 --> 01:34:41.750
and helpless.

01:34:43.817 --> 01:34:46.251
Your brother would've
thrown away the key.

01:34:48.451 --> 01:34:50.317
Hey!

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.084
Look who it is.

01:34:52.117 --> 01:34:55.017
Should we invite your mother
into this conversation?

01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:56.417
- Let's do it.
- No!

01:34:56.451 --> 01:34:57.984
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- No, leave her.

01:34:58.017 --> 01:34:59.917
Hey, I just wanna say,

01:34:59.950 --> 01:35:02.783
I really did enjoy
our time together,

01:35:02.817 --> 01:35:05.117
even though it was
under false pretenses.

01:35:06.817 --> 01:35:09.783
Catherine!
Can you hear me, sweetheart?

01:35:09.817 --> 01:35:11.184
No! Get away from her!

01:35:11.217 --> 01:35:13.050
Get you up. Let's get up.

01:35:13.084 --> 01:35:14.317
There you go!

01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:16.351
The floor's cold, come on.

01:35:16.384 --> 01:35:18.884
This is between you...

01:35:18.917 --> 01:35:19.984
You and me.

01:35:20.017 --> 01:35:22.050
That is where you're wrong.

01:35:22.084 --> 01:35:27.750
You really think your perfect
life is built on integrity?

01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:31.783
You're the monster, Catherine.

01:35:31.817 --> 01:35:33.384
You just live in a nicer house.

01:35:33.417 --> 01:35:34.384
Don't you touch her!

01:35:34.417 --> 01:35:36.783
Okay, okay, okay!

01:35:36.817 --> 01:35:39.284
We're just getting to the bit
where you come in.

01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:45.151
See, back in the day, your mom,

01:35:45.184 --> 01:35:48.050
she was a tight little thing.

01:35:48.084 --> 01:35:49.984
Whoa!

01:35:50.017 --> 01:35:52.184
Gross.

01:35:52.217 --> 01:35:54.451
Catherine,
tell her about that night.

01:35:54.484 --> 01:35:55.950
Come on.

01:35:55.984 --> 01:35:59.950
Tell her all about
that special night.

01:35:59.984 --> 01:36:01.184
You're gonna love this.

01:36:01.217 --> 01:36:03.384
- Tell her!
- Fuck you!

01:36:03.417 --> 01:36:05.317
Whoa, whoa!

01:36:05.351 --> 01:36:07.783
That was close.

01:36:07.817 --> 01:36:09.217
All right, I'll tell her.

01:36:09.251 --> 01:36:13.217
It was what I used to call
my ace in the hole.

01:36:13.251 --> 01:36:17.017
That night,
I wanted the full tour.

01:36:18.783 --> 01:36:20.317
Oh, come on!

01:36:20.351 --> 01:36:22.817
Don't you give me that look.

01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:25.251
I know you wanted it
as much as I did.

01:36:25.284 --> 01:36:27.950
You just didn't want
to let yourself have it.

01:36:27.984 --> 01:36:29.084
You're a rapist.

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.817
I mean...

01:36:30.850 --> 01:36:32.284
semantics, you know?

01:36:34.017 --> 01:36:35.351
You should be dead.

01:36:35.384 --> 01:36:36.950
I should be dead.

01:36:36.984 --> 01:36:38.384
I should be a lot of things.

01:36:38.417 --> 01:36:40.017
Carson, Carson.

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:44.284
Why could you not just
lie to your husband

01:36:44.317 --> 01:36:47.417
like a normal fucking wife?!

01:36:47.451 --> 01:36:49.884
You know, he didn't even
give me the chance

01:36:49.917 --> 01:36:52.417
to talk my way out of it.

01:36:52.451 --> 01:36:54.950
And then that sound.

01:36:56.884 --> 01:36:58.217
Eww!

01:36:58.251 --> 01:37:00.783
It's like hitting a deer,

01:37:00.817 --> 01:37:04.151
except you can't leave that
on the side of the road.

01:37:07.284 --> 01:37:11.217
That moment, I owned him.

01:37:11.251 --> 01:37:12.817
And he knew it.

01:37:12.850 --> 01:37:15.783
"Rich playboy...

01:37:15.817 --> 01:37:17.151
drunk at the wheel...

01:37:17.184 --> 01:37:19.184
kills promising young student."

01:37:19.217 --> 01:37:22.217
Come on!

01:37:22.251 --> 01:37:25.217
The headlines,
they wrote themselves!

01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:27.683
I was gonna bleed him dry,

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.950
and there was nothing
he could do about it.

01:37:33.317 --> 01:37:34.284
Almost nothing.

01:37:34.317 --> 01:37:35.251
Carson!

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:38.817
I gotta say...

01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:41.017
I didn't realize
he had it in him.

01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:44.117
I mean, I am a bad man,

01:37:44.151 --> 01:37:47.351
but Archer Monroe
was the goddamn devil.

01:37:47.384 --> 01:37:50.683
Truth is, Archer knew
that there are some fates

01:37:50.717 --> 01:37:53.284
that are much worse
than death.

01:37:53.317 --> 01:37:57.451
He needed me to suffer,

01:37:57.484 --> 01:37:59.384
to rot,

01:37:59.417 --> 01:38:03.050
to waste away in the dark.

01:38:03.084 --> 01:38:05.151
He vented, and I listened.

01:38:05.184 --> 01:38:08.050
He beat me, and I took it.

01:38:08.084 --> 01:38:13.251
My agony was
your daddy's private joy.

01:38:13.284 --> 01:38:15.184
The thing is,
about zookeepers,

01:38:15.217 --> 01:38:18.984
they always wind up
talking to their animals.

01:38:19.017 --> 01:38:23.017
And over time,
things kind of changed.

01:38:23.050 --> 01:38:28.717
See, I don't think he ever
expected me to get out.

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:30.917
Whoa!

01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:32.451
That was a close one.

01:38:32.484 --> 01:38:34.817
That was a real close one.

01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:37.384
I should've put a bullet
in your head myself.

01:38:37.417 --> 01:38:39.351
No! Morgan!

01:38:40.884 --> 01:38:42.251
Revenge!

01:38:42.284 --> 01:38:44.384
You can't put a price on it,
Catherine.

01:38:44.417 --> 01:38:45.351
Carson.

01:38:52.217 --> 01:38:53.351
What do you want?

01:38:53.384 --> 01:38:55.884
I want my pound of flesh.

01:38:55.917 --> 01:38:57.683
Then let me help you.

01:38:58.817 --> 01:39:01.850
I'll testify to the truth.

01:39:01.884 --> 01:39:05.084
I'll expose all the secrets.
Everything.

01:39:05.117 --> 01:39:09.251
Everything my family did.
Just let them live.

01:39:13.884 --> 01:39:14.917
You'd do that for me?

01:39:17.783 --> 01:39:19.050
Psych!

01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:21.683
I don't need your help.

01:39:21.717 --> 01:39:23.184
I don't cut deals.

01:39:23.217 --> 01:39:25.084
Fine.

01:39:25.117 --> 01:39:26.917
Then fuck you!

01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:29.017
I gave you excuses.

01:39:29.050 --> 01:39:32.084
But I swear you're not walking
out of that door alive.

01:39:32.117 --> 01:39:35.817
I am really, really excited

01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:38.783
to meet the rest
of your family.

01:39:40.917 --> 01:39:42.117
Especially Claire.

01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:44.884
I swear to God,
if you touch her...

01:39:44.917 --> 01:39:46.783
You'll what?!

01:39:46.817 --> 01:39:49.783
You'll beg for mercy?

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:52.050
You'll smudge your makeup
with tears?

01:39:52.084 --> 01:39:53.317
Fuck you.

01:39:57.017 --> 01:39:59.917
You remember that little speech
you gave me

01:39:59.950 --> 01:40:02.084
with the evidence bag?

01:40:02.117 --> 01:40:03.817
It was very cool.

01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:05.317
Gave me chills.

01:40:05.351 --> 01:40:07.284
Here's my counter.

01:40:09.317 --> 01:40:13.817
I am gonna burn this family's
legacy to the ground

01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:17.351
with the secrets that I know.

01:40:17.384 --> 01:40:20.351
I am gonna slit your
little brother's throat,

01:40:20.384 --> 01:40:24.451
and I am gonna take a piss
on Archer's grave.

01:40:24.484 --> 01:40:27.251
And you will not be there

01:40:27.284 --> 01:40:29.384
to experience
your family's shame

01:40:29.417 --> 01:40:35.351
because you and your fucking
whore mother will be here,

01:40:35.384 --> 01:40:38.284
rotting away in the darkness.

01:40:38.317 --> 01:40:41.717
Now, your body
will consume itself.

01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:44.084
Your sanity will snap.

01:40:44.117 --> 01:40:48.984
And just before you
die your miserable death,

01:40:49.017 --> 01:40:54.284
you will know exactly
what I survived.

01:40:54.317 --> 01:40:57.984
And your husband
and your daughter

01:40:58.017 --> 01:40:59.984
will spend
the rest of their lives

01:41:00.017 --> 01:41:03.817
wondering why Mommy
abandoned them.

01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:05.817
And...

01:41:05.850 --> 01:41:09.251
I almost forgot
the most important part.

01:41:09.284 --> 01:41:11.117
When I tell 'em that I...

01:41:11.151 --> 01:41:14.917
A pathetic lunatic?

01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:17.217
Yeah, no one's
ever gonna believe you.

01:41:17.251 --> 01:41:18.884
No one ever even
looked for you

01:41:18.917 --> 01:41:20.850
- because you don't matter.
- Shut up.

01:41:20.884 --> 01:41:22.251
Not even to your own father.

01:41:22.284 --> 01:41:23.917
Shut the hell up!

01:41:40.251 --> 01:41:41.417
Ow!

01:41:41.451 --> 01:41:42.984
Goddamn it!

01:41:44.184 --> 01:41:47.251
You still don't get it,
do ya?

01:41:47.284 --> 01:41:50.618
I'm your goddamn father!

01:42:27.984 --> 01:42:30.184
You're a Monroe.

01:42:30.217 --> 01:42:32.017
You understand me?

01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:40.084
We take care of our own.

01:42:46.484 --> 01:42:48.417
What'll we do about him?

01:42:52.284 --> 01:42:55.050
He disappeared 30 years ago.
