18:03.416 --> 18:04.577
- What --
- Jesus, Maddy.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.699
Did you do this?

18:05.710 --> 18:07.747
What? I didn't do that!

18:07.753 --> 18:09.369
But I didn't do that!

18:10.381 --> 18:11.542
My God.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.961
Well, obviously,
somebody's been here.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.758
[chuckles]
It's probably just a couple

18:15.970 --> 18:17.381
of kids fuckin' around

18:17.388 --> 18:18.844
but you don't think
we're the first vandals

18:18.848 --> 18:20.338
to have this bright idea,
right?

18:20.349 --> 18:22.056
Speakin' of bright,
why the fuck

18:22.059 --> 18:23.299
did the lights
just come on?

18:23.311 --> 18:25.177
Maybe somebody
paid the bill.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.603
Yeah, maybe.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.320
<i>Yeah. Well, whatever.</i>

18:36.324 --> 18:37.906
<i>It just makes it easier
for you to see</i>

18:37.908 --> 18:40.491
how awesome my brand-new
leather jacket is.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.111
Meow.

18:43.122 --> 18:43.862
[chuckles]

18:45.166 --> 18:47.032
[sighs]
God.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.117
[sighs]

18:50.588 --> 18:51.794
Okay. Well..

18:53.049 --> 18:54.915
Still plenty to loot

18:54.925 --> 18:58.418
so...I'm gonna loot.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.470
- I'm just gonna be a minute.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.012
<i>Take your time.</i>

19:04.060 --> 19:05.846
- Oh, my God. What?
- Relax.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.890
I just wanna talk to you
for a second.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.604
Listen,
I'm worried about Maddy.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.143
Oh, is this some
more of your psychobabble

19:11.150 --> 19:12.891
because you're
a guidance counselor?

19:12.902 --> 19:15.018
Therapist, Izzy.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.815
Look, Jake, she hasn't
been here in 25 years.

19:16.822 --> 19:17.732
Just give her
a break, okay?

19:17.740 --> 19:19.731
You sure about that?

19:19.742 --> 19:21.198
What does that mean?

19:21.202 --> 19:22.909
Do you know she's
been havin' nightmares?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.448
She barely even
sleeps anymore.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.742
Well, maybe she doesn't
wanna sleep with you.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.745
<i>I'm not screwin' around, Izzy. Look,
I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'.</i>

19:29.960 --> 19:32.622
<i>She got a call from her
principal the other day.</i>

19:32.838 --> 19:34.545
<i>Some of the kids in the class haven't
been given grades on their papers.</i>

19:34.757 --> 19:37.294
<i>She's just been' scratching
groups of five on 'em.</i>

19:37.301 --> 19:40.009
You know, four in a row
and then a slash?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.633
Parents are complaining.
She's not tellin' me anything.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.259
I don't know what the hell's going on,
so I look in her lesson planner

19:44.475 --> 19:45.431
and it's the same thing, Izzy

19:45.643 --> 19:47.725
just groups of five
all over the pages.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.102
What?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.773
She used to do that
when we were kids

19:54.777 --> 19:57.235
when she first came
to live with us.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.104
Then my mom took her
to a psychiatrist

19:59.115 --> 20:00.947
got her on some meds and
then she finally stopped.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.695
Uh, so what do you think
it means?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.572
The atomic number
of boron?

20:08.582 --> 20:09.868
[scoffs]

20:09.875 --> 20:11.582
I don't know.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.541
[sighs]

20:16.424 --> 20:18.631
<i>Do you know anything
about the Law of Fives?</i>

20:18.801 --> 20:20.417
[sighs]
No.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.671
There's a religious sect
called Discordianism.

20:24.890 --> 20:28.884
They call it pure chaos which humans
can't even begin to understand.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.640
<i>And in pure chaos,
the only discernible order</i>

20:31.647 --> 20:34.309
<i>is the Law of Fives.</i>

20:34.316 --> 20:35.647
<i>Everything happens
in fives</i>

20:35.651 --> 20:39.770
or somehow
appropriate to fives.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.944
They say the Law of Fives
is never wrong.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.784
So you think
she's a, a Discordianist?

20:46.787 --> 20:49.495
No, dipshit. I'm saying I
don't have a fuckin' clue.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.330
[chuckles]

20:51.333 --> 20:53.119
Right. That's a good one.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.292
[chuckles]
I don't know, Jake. I'm so sorry.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.371
Izzy, nobody knows her
like you do.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.083
You can't tell me you haven't noticed
something wrong with Maddy.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.293
Hm.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.920
Look, all I'm askin'
is just..

21:05.139 --> 21:06.675
Help me keep an eye on her,
okay?

21:08.642 --> 21:09.382
Okay.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.511

21:26.660 --> 21:29.322
Hey. You okay?

21:29.330 --> 21:31.788
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.953
It's just, it's a lot
to take in, you know?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.916
- Yeah.
- No, wait.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.878
Can we, um, just leave
that room alone for now?

21:38.881 --> 21:40.212
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.547
Probably nothin'
but baby toys, anyway.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.919
<i>Right.</i>

21:46.931 --> 21:49.798
[eerie music]

21:59.193 --> 22:01.981
[bottle clinking]

22:04.907 --> 22:06.443
Alright, what the hell
is that?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.316
- What's what?
- Izzy?

22:10.246 --> 22:13.034
- Oh. Oh, these?
- Those.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.656
[chuckles]
They're just..

22:15.709 --> 22:16.494
Give 'em to me.

22:18.629 --> 22:19.619
Xanax?

22:19.797 --> 22:21.458
- You know those are over
two decades old, right?

22:21.674 --> 22:23.164
Probably makes it
that much more potent.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.083
Probably makes them
that much more poisonous.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.713
You could have really
hurt yourself, Izzy!

22:26.929 --> 22:29.296
Wait, no!

22:29.306 --> 22:30.842
I have been
under some serious

22:30.850 --> 22:32.215
emotional stress lately.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.012
Okay, well,
then smoke a joint.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.180
Oh, well,
joints cost money.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.723
And if I had a roommate
who was still paying

22:36.939 --> 22:38.225
for half her rent, then maybe
I could afford my joints --

22:38.440 --> 22:39.475
Okay. Alright.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.396
[bottle clinking]

22:42.403 --> 22:44.610
- Seriously?
- Nice.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.024
Oh.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.271
Give me the rest.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.573
[Izzy sighs]

22:49.577 --> 22:50.863
I was only gonna
take as needed.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.827
- <i>I can't believe you.</i>
- Nice.

22:52.830 --> 22:53.865
[Izzy chuckles]

22:53.873 --> 22:54.829
Oh.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.788
You wanna talk about it?

22:59.795 --> 23:01.411
"You wanna talk about it?"

23:07.177 --> 23:08.212
[sighs]

23:11.307 --> 23:12.297

23:24.403 --> 23:26.815
Oh, really? Goddamn it.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.614
Oh, gosh.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.247
[breathing heavily]

23:42.254 --> 23:44.712
- You okay?
- What happened?

23:44.715 --> 23:47.332
[breathing heavily]

23:48.969 --> 23:51.506
Nothing. It was,
it was just a..

23:51.513 --> 23:53.174
It was just a spider.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.547
[Maddy breathing heavily]

23:54.558 --> 23:55.514
Ew.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.930
You Okay?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.805
Yeah, it was,
it was just a big one.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.930
It's okay,
I think we're ready

24:02.942 --> 24:04.057
<i>to get the hell out of
here, right?</i>

24:04.276 --> 24:07.234
No, I just, I wanna stay
a little longer.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.564
[sighs]
Okay-

24:20.793 --> 24:22.830
Maddy.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.794
Listen, I know you're
looking for answers, okay?

24:26.006 --> 24:27.622
But if there is one, you're
not gonna find it here.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.377
Okay?

24:29.551 --> 24:32.760
People can be, uh,
mysteries.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.089
Is that what you tell
your clients?

24:38.519 --> 24:40.886
My mother was
an alcoholic.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.307
She was also
a psychologist

24:42.523 --> 24:44.514
who spent her entire
career treatin' sick people.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.225
<i>How could she not know
she was sick?</i>

24:47.236 --> 24:48.647
Or more important,
care enough

24:48.654 --> 24:51.988
to do somethin' about it?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.197
I watched for 16 years

24:53.200 --> 24:55.191
as she slowly
drank herself to death

24:55.411 --> 24:57.743
<i>but I don't have my answers.
And you were what?</i>

24:57.955 --> 25:00.663
You were, uh, three when
you last saw your mom.

25:00.666 --> 25:01.997
Well,
that's not good enough.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.116
It has to be, Maddy.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.758
I, uh, called my father
last week.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.001
- You did what?
- Look.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.425
I just had to ask him
some questions, okay?

25:16.432 --> 25:19.925
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Look, he -- he said..

25:19.935 --> 25:21.517
He told me
it wasn't her fault

25:21.520 --> 25:24.387
that -- that something in
this house made her do it!

25:24.398 --> 25:26.264
You don't really believe
that, do you, Maddy?

25:28.110 --> 25:30.067
Baby, it's just a house.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.232
It's just a house
with drywall

25:32.239 --> 25:33.479
with an insulation.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.697
It's -- it's a house!

25:35.701 --> 25:36.816
[sighs]

25:41.749 --> 25:43.205
[sighs]

25:43.375 --> 25:47.039
Look at us.
We were normal, happy.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.337
<i>Then my mom got pregnant.
We needed a bit more room.</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:52.256
You know,
we found this house.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.463
It was so cheap, my dad
couldn't turn it down.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.255
Three weeks later,
mom and Olivia were dead.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.927
Dad was locked up and I

26:00.934 --> 26:02.720
I went and lived
with Aunt Nor.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.933
[dramatic music]

26:06.940 --> 26:07.771

26:09.276 --> 26:10.607
<i>Hey, hey-.</i>

26:10.611 --> 26:12.397

Don't.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.819
[sobbing]

26:16.825 --> 26:17.860
<i>After I talked to my clad,
you know</i>

26:17.868 --> 26:19.358
I -- I thought
it was bullshit, too.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.781
I mean, he's crazy, right?

26:21.789 --> 26:23.905
But then I, I did
research of my own.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.365
Here, here, check this out.
Look at this.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.126
What do you see?

26:31.381 --> 26:32.621
<i>An old picture
of this house.</i>

26:32.633 --> 26:34.374
No. Cle Elum.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.043
Washington. 1942.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.385
An old man
murdered his whole family

26:38.388 --> 26:40.129
and then hung himself
from the second floor.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.884
<i>Holly Springs,
North Carolina. 1976.</i>

26:44.895 --> 26:47.478
An old woman
used to rent out rooms.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.939
Then she poisoned everyone
at dinner with bleach.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.024
<i>With bleach! It's this
house, you guys.</i>

26:52.027 --> 26:53.392
<i>I know it.</i>

26:53.403 --> 26:55.064
- I mean..
- <i>It's a</i> coin..

26:55.280 --> 26:57.112
- Hey, hey. It's a coincidence, Maddy.
- <i>But</i> --

26:57.324 --> 27:00.567
People use the same
architectural plans all the time.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.619
After the murders,
they just vanished.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.580
Houses don't just vanish,
Maddy.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.448
Uh..

27:10.462 --> 27:11.918
Goddamn it.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.185

Hey.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.401
Just listen to the
voicemail my dad left me.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.315
<i>Hey, baby girl, I, uh</i>

27:37.322 --> 27:40.280
<i>I -- I -- I just wanna
tell you about that day</i>

27:40.492 --> 27:42.608
<i>and I've never told you and I don't
think there's much time now.</i>

27:44.872 --> 27:47.830
<i>It wasn't her fault,
Maddy.</i>

27:47.833 --> 27:49.790
<i>It was somethin'
in that house, it..</i>

27:49.793 --> 27:52.080
<i>Something
that, that made her do it.</i>

27:52.087 --> 27:54.795
[birds chirping]

27:54.798 --> 27:57.460
<i>I think it got into
all of us.</i>

27:57.634 --> 28:01.252
<i>When I came home, there
was blood everywhere</i>

28:01.263 --> 28:02.879
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

28:02.890 --> 28:04.551
<i>She'd broken a plate
and it looked like</i>

28:04.558 --> 28:06.299
<i>she'd stepped on
one of the pieces.</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:27.577
<i>No one answered.</i>

28:31.710 --> 28:33.542
<i>I followed the bloody
footprints to the stairs.</i>

28:37.758 --> 28:39.044
<i>Hey! No, no!</i>

<i>There, there -- there..</i>

28:45.891 --> 28:48.132
<i>There was no one
in the house, Maddy.</i>

28:48.143 --> 28:51.101
<i>There was no one
in the house.</i>

Oh, my God.

49:49.361 --> 49:51.978
[Jake breathing heavily]

50:02.208 --> 50:05.542
- I think he's my brother.
- What?

50:05.544 --> 50:08.411
Yeah, I, I have a brother

50:08.422 --> 50:09.537
or I -- I had one.

50:09.757 --> 50:11.748
- God, how old's this thing?
- I don't know.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.958
I saw a plaster-cast
handprint in the basement.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.255
It said '82.

50:15.262 --> 50:17.003
Oh, my God, he'd be
five years older than me.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.301
You've never
seen him before?

50:19.517 --> 50:22.930
No! God, I can't believe they
never told me about him.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.512
- Huh? - What --
what are you.. What are you doing?

50:25.731 --> 50:27.017
- Trust me.
- <i>Wait.</i>

50:27.024 --> 50:28.310
If she moves
or if she struggles

50:28.317 --> 50:29.899
it'll choke her, okay?

50:29.902 --> 50:31.313
Where did you learn
how to do that?

50:31.529 --> 50:34.112
- TV.
- What have you been watching?

50:34.323 --> 50:37.941
"Dexter." Listen, what does this kid
have to do with any of this, huh?

50:38.160 --> 50:40.322
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

50:40.538 --> 50:41.494
- No.
- And you don't know

50:41.705 --> 50:42.786
what happened to him?

50:42.998 --> 50:45.911
No! God, I didn't even know
he was alive.

50:46.126 --> 50:48.208
[breathing heavily]
That ought to hold.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.886
- But maybe she does.
- Stay right there.

51:01.559 --> 51:02.549
Oh, my God.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.427
[panting]

51:21.120 --> 51:22.656
[gasps]

51:22.663 --> 51:25.371

51:25.374 --> 51:27.615
Stop struggling
if you wanna breathe.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.617
Alright? Stop struggling!

51:29.837 --> 51:31.874
- Let me go.
- Izzy! Izzy, what happened?

51:32.089 --> 51:34.251
Well -- well, let me go.

51:34.258 --> 51:35.419
Izzy, tell us
what happened.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.255
[sobbing]

51:38.262 --> 51:40.629
What happened, Izzy, huh?

51:40.639 --> 51:42.971
You don't understand.

51:42.975 --> 51:44.761
[sobbing]
You didn't see.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.510
Seen what, Izzy, huh?
Seen what?

51:47.730 --> 51:50.597
[breathing heavily] They're so
much older than you think.

51:52.192 --> 51:53.648
And they're
so much stronger.

51:53.652 --> 51:55.438
Who?

51:55.446 --> 51:57.312
Sh -- she thinks she got
away, but she didn't.

51:57.323 --> 52:00.406
They don't let her go.
They never let her go.

52:00.409 --> 52:01.490
What are you
talkin' about?

52:01.493 --> 52:03.325
And she's not
gonna stop there.

52:03.329 --> 52:06.071
[breathing heavily]
She's gonna kill us.

52:06.081 --> 52:07.367
- What?
- What?

52:07.374 --> 52:08.910
I know you're afraid
that she's gonna

52:08.917 --> 52:10.157
turn out like your mother

52:10.169 --> 52:13.332
that she's gonna hide her
vodka in the living room

52:13.339 --> 52:15.125
like she always did
when you were a boy.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.294
What?
What is she talking about?

52:17.468 --> 52:20.210
That she's gonna pass out
at your birthday party..

52:20.429 --> 52:24.593
[sobbing] ...and that she's gonna
drink herself to death.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.424
What is she talkin' about?
What are you talking about?

52:26.644 --> 52:29.306
Who is this? Did they say
anything about him?

52:29.313 --> 52:30.678
[sobbing]

52:30.689 --> 52:32.646
- Is this my brother?
- He had an accident.

52:32.650 --> 52:35.142
[breathing heavily]

52:35.152 --> 52:36.768
What happened?

52:36.987 --> 52:38.728
So many people had accidents
around your mother.

52:38.947 --> 52:41.279
[breathing heavily]

52:41.283 --> 52:44.025
He was in the tub..

52:44.036 --> 52:45.947
...and she was supposed
to be watching him.

52:48.123 --> 52:49.534
Oh, oh,
they showed me that, too.

52:49.541 --> 52:52.124
[sobbing]

52:52.127 --> 52:54.084
They showed me
so many things

52:54.088 --> 52:56.455
and it's all
I can see now.

52:56.465 --> 52:58.081

52:58.092 --> 53:00.834
Please let me go!

some fuckin' answers.</i>

53:01.929 --> 53:03.340
I don't wanna see anymore!

What do you mean stop..

53:04.848 --> 53:06.213
<i>What did you mean
they were gonna stop?</i>

53:06.433 --> 53:08.174
- Can you please let me go?
- No.

53:08.394 --> 53:10.852
Not until you give us some fucking
answers, Izzy! What did you mean?

53:11.063 --> 53:12.645
- I don't wanna see --
- What did you mean

53:12.856 --> 53:13.846
they were gonna stop?

53:13.857 --> 53:15.564
- With Maddy?
What did you mean by that?

53:15.776 --> 53:16.857
- I don't wanna see.

She's choking!
She's choking!

- Oh, shit.

53:52.271 --> 53:55.559
- Hurry up!
- Ah! Fuck!

Alright, get it off.

- Is she alright? Oh, shit.
- I think so.

54:18.839 --> 54:21.206
God! Damn it, Jake.

54:21.216 --> 54:23.082
How was it
supposed to work?

54:23.260 --> 54:25.001
I didn't know she
was gonna choke herself.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.131
- What the fuck was she
talkin' about, huh?

54:27.347 --> 54:28.508
- I don't know.

54:28.724 --> 54:31.182
How could she know those
things about my mother?

54:31.185 --> 54:32.971
I never told anybody
that shit.

54:32.978 --> 54:35.390
That's what
this place does.

54:35.397 --> 54:37.104
It takes things
from our minds

54:37.107 --> 54:38.973
and uses them against us.

54:38.984 --> 54:41.772
I saw the boy
from the picture.

54:41.779 --> 54:43.895
We never should have
come here.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.738
<i>We never should have
come here.</i>

54:45.741 --> 54:48.449
We're gonna get out of
here, all of us.

if we didn't come here.</i>

<i>I should've never
brought us here.</i>

56:03.026 --> 56:05.313
I'm scared, Jake.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.357
Look, she's dangerous,
okay?

56:07.364 --> 56:09.071
We just have to keep her
in view, alright?

56:09.074 --> 56:11.031
[indistinct chattering]

56:11.034 --> 56:12.524
<i>...get her out of here.</i>

56:12.536 --> 56:13.446
<i>She tried to kill us,
Madison.</i>

56:13.453 --> 56:16.662
No, it's just,
it's just using her. Okay?

56:16.665 --> 56:17.746
If we can get her
out of here

56:17.749 --> 56:19.160
maybe she won't be
like that.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.829
Yeah, you saw how that
worked, didn't you?

56:21.837 --> 56:23.919

out of here.</i>

She said they called you
here for something.

You know, I'm hiding like --
like I did that day

No matter where I hide,
she always finds me

and she tells me,
"You must die.

Don't you see?
Five must die."

59:41.578 --> 59:43.285
That doesn't mean anything, Madison.
It's just --

59:43.497 --> 59:46.114
What?
It's just another dream?

59:46.124 --> 59:48.240
Another coincidence?

59:49.836 --> 59:52.749
Look, right before
I talked to my father

59:52.756 --> 59:54.713
I started having that
same nightmare again.

59:54.716 --> 59:56.127
It was like
I already knew.

here first, you know?

I want to know
why she did what she did

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:25.035

of me, too.

She -- she blinded herself
so she couldn't find me?

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:42.226
Very clever.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:47.356
Of course..

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:51.197
...your father took care
of her..

you'd already run off..</i>

...and it was too late

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.906

three more.

anymore

to your father..</i>

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.296
...and we called to you.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:19.350
And now you are here

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:22.436
with the three
that we need.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.896
Why five?

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.935
Five is harmony.

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.238
It is the key
that opens the door.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:36.200
And you step through
the chaos..

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.074
[breathing heavily]
...and you exit the other side

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.872
and you are washed free

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:44.869
of all that beautiful,
beautiful blood..

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.709
