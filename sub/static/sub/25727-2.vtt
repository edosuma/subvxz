Are you tipping my dancing?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.168
- Yeah.
- I'm not a stripper,

00:44.169 --> 00:45.670
but, obviously, I will keep this.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.433

The homeless guy who used the bathroom,

00:55.430 --> 00:57.598
he was really enthusiastic about you.

If I'm ever gonna get the chance

00:59.226 --> 01:01.769

01:23.542 --> 01:25.251

It's only legal in Florida.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.757
I spent my entire
aquatic budget for the year,

01:31.758 --> 01:33.968

- God, I hope so.

addition to any tank.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.746
I'm really scared of skater boys,

02:43.747 --> 02:46.249

Oh. Yeah, you really put
your own spin on it.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.199
Hey, Stainz, how would you like to make

10:17.200 --> 10:18.701
a little extra cash for your vandalism?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.538
I mean, I was gonna rob you, but...

10:22.539 --> 10:23.872
I guess I'm down to collab.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.290
I'm glad we segued out of robbery

10:25.291 --> 10:26.626
into something artistic.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.255
So, is it illegal to watch
someone do a graffiti?

10:31.256 --> 10:33.632
Like, am I an accessory
to a graffiti right now?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.801
No one says "graffiti," Dad.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.052
I'm done.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.679
- You're done?
- Where's my cash?

10:38.680 --> 10:41.640
Well, traditionally, a tang
fish has a black oval body

10:41.641 --> 10:44.434
and blue pectoral fins, so we're gonna
have to do another pass at this

10:44.435 --> 10:45.835
and maybe add in some more detail.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.855
That would've been better
if you would've told me that

10:47.856 --> 10:49.918
before I started. You
literally just said "a fish."

10:49.929 --> 10:52.609
Well, I had "tang" in mind.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.319
Do you hear that? Oh, my God.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.196
Dude, just take it. Run! Five-O, dude!

11:01.578 --> 11:04.538
What's the code
for the Big Bopper Bibimbap?

11:04.539 --> 11:06.415
- It's "5-1-5."
- Neel?

11:06.416 --> 11:08.167
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.793
You should be at home resting.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.587
Not with my medical bills.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.173
But the restaurant is letting me
pick up some extra shifts, so...

11:14.174 --> 11:15.924
Sure, it's still nice to be bringing

11:15.925 --> 11:19.303
the kids joy, though,
by bussing their tables.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.889
Listen, could you be a dear
and help me get these lemon wedges?

11:21.890 --> 11:24.308
I've been trying for 15 minutes, so...

11:24.309 --> 11:26.768
OK, Neel, there's something
that I have to talk to you...

11:26.769 --> 11:28.770
- Neel! Come on.
- Yeah?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.856
There's lemons everywhere, OK?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.984
Less blab-y, more bus-y.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.360
- I got it.
- OK.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.112
You. I'm gonna need you to move

11:37.113 --> 11:40.532
to the lunch rush shift, OK?
You're taking Neel's spot.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.784
Wait, you want me
to work the lunch rush?

11:42.785 --> 11:44.828
- Yeah.
- This is like when Sutton Foster

11:44.829 --> 11:46.955
was the understudy
and then she became the lead

11:46.956 --> 11:48.999
and ended up winning the Tony.
I never even dreamed

11:49.000 --> 11:51.710
or obsessed and imagined
that this could happen to me.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.045
Well, it's temporary, OK?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.339
So just do the best you can
to not blow it.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.925
You won't regret this,
Annette. I will kill it.

11:57.926 --> 12:01.220
K.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.723
Neel, I want you to know
that every single step

12:04.724 --> 12:06.808
I take out there is gonna be for you.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.178
That's very sweet of you.

12:09.189 --> 12:11.230
But can you seriously help me
with these lemons?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.088
I can't, I have to go call my parents.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.156
Wow, so you're, like, the star now.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.577
Yeah! And Neel is.... He's doing good.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.955
Check it out! Pootie has been avenged.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.415
I'm pretty much what would
happen if John Wick was Banksy.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.502
Benji, you did graffiti?
Are you high on a drug?

12:33.503 --> 12:35.629
Is it Xanax? I've heard about Xanax.

12:35.630 --> 12:39.758
Yo, Chad, you really do
murder tang, bro!

12:39.759 --> 12:42.219
OK, so, my tag is being misconstrued

12:42.220 --> 12:43.971
as a pretty immature sex joke,

12:43.972 --> 12:46.014
but the point is, revenge achieved.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.891
Why did you sign it "Phat Chew"?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.893
Isn't that the guy
that you really don't like?

12:49.894 --> 12:52.604
Oh, whassup! Man, y'all gonna
make this bigger

12:52.605 --> 12:55.274
than that "Ermahgerd" girl.
She's still mad funny.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.484
Pootie would not have approved of this.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.237
Oh, and don't forget, if you tag
"@Supertrill" on the 'grams,

13:00.238 --> 13:02.864
I'll give you 10% off all purchases.

13:02.865 --> 13:08.245
Profiting off the vandalism I paid a
guy to make with my parents' money.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.915
This Phat Chew's the lowest
piece of shit possible.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.668
I... Really?

13:14.669 --> 13:18.046
Oh, it's 10% off, and I love coupons.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.633
Also, the lighting is so good!

13:28.850 --> 13:31.476
- He posted again!
- <i>What's up, Chew Tang Clan!</i>

13:31.477 --> 13:33.395
<i>Hey, I just wanna thank y'all so much</i>

13:33.396 --> 13:36.648
<i>for supportin' my store,
and comin' to check out my art.</i>

13:36.649 --> 13:39.026
<i>That's me, right there. Phat Chew!</i>

13:39.027 --> 13:41.028
That's it. I gotta play
by street rules now.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.696
Do you know street rules?

13:42.697 --> 13:45.073
You look like you only know
cul-de-sac rules.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.950
Maybe Old Benji didn't know
street rules,

13:46.951 --> 13:50.606
but Old Benji died with Pootie.
You're lookin' at Street Benji.

13:50.617 --> 13:52.112
And when ya take Street Benji's tag,

13:52.123 --> 13:54.125
he comes right back at ya
and tags harder.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.377
Hey, Stainz. I wanted to inquire,

13:57.378 --> 14:00.548
would you be interested in doing
some more vandalism for me?

14:02.935 --> 14:05.552
<i>♪ When will the sun come out ♪</i>

14:05.553 --> 14:07.889
<i>♪ And dry these tears ♪</i>

14:11.142 --> 14:13.477
Sorry, folks. Th... That was my fault.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.938
I got it. I got it. I have to learn.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.494
Hey, gorgeous. You look amazing.

14:24.505 --> 14:25.989
And I don't want to freak you out,

14:25.990 --> 14:28.075
but, um, I just found out

14:28.076 --> 14:29.785
that Doug Hester is coming tonight.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.412
Shut up. Doug Hester?

14:32.413 --> 14:33.997
- Yup.
- From Anaheim?

14:33.998 --> 14:36.083
I mean, he's the godfather

14:36.084 --> 14:38.043
of nostalgia-based themed restaurants.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.712
Oh, I know. And word on the street is,

14:40.713 --> 14:41.922
he's looking for new talent.

14:41.923 --> 14:45.634
Anaheim Garden Walk?

14:45.635 --> 14:47.010
That's Disney-adjacent.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.137
It's the flagship.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.765
I mean, I guess I can't
stay in Hollywood forever.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.684
- No.
- When Anaheim Garden Walk calls,

14:54.685 --> 14:56.728
you pick up the phone.

14:56.729 --> 15:00.649
You know what? Jimmy
Fifties, if he did exist,

15:00.650 --> 15:02.902
would be very, very proud of you.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.991
I know I'm proud of you.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.453
You heard. Doug Hester. Anaheim.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.789
Ana-<i>heim.</i> Don't worry.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.083
Whatever happens today is your destiny.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.585
It's the world giving back
what you put into it.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.797
I mean, you've earned this,
haven't you, Esther?

15:23.798 --> 15:25.632
- I... Neel?
- Yeah?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.552
I...

15:29.971 --> 15:31.597
I'm finished with my shake. Thank you.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.095
Wait, no, I... I think
I changed my mind.

15:37.106 --> 15:39.857
Bro, I don't got all day, OK?
Just tell me what you want me to paint.

15:39.868 --> 15:42.548
Just trying to get into a flow here.
I want it to be minimalist,

15:42.559 --> 15:44.568
but I also want it to say,
"Stole a fish,

15:44.569 --> 15:46.027
said a tag was his that wasn't,"

15:46.028 --> 15:47.829
but it can't read
as an accidental sex joke.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.240
Man, let's just draw a big dick
on here and call it a day.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.034
Again, Stainz, you've been
heard, and you've been rejected.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.995
Hey, what the hell y'all doin'?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.956
Oh! Skrt skrt,
what'd y'all do to my art?

15:57.957 --> 16:01.001
It's mine! You can't just take other
people's art and pretend it's yours.

16:01.002 --> 16:04.036
Uh, I'm a DJ. That's exactly
what I do, bruh.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.381
- You're a shoe salesman.
- Well, if I'm a shoe salesman,

16:06.382 --> 16:09.176
I'm a artistic one. And that's my art.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.136
I painted this, so y'all are both wack.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.512
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.140
Ain't no intellectual property
in the modern age.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.435
My store, my wall, my art.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.604
You're an idiot. That's
my paint on that wall.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.938
Not yours! Your fish didn't die!

16:23.192 --> 16:25.535
<i>OK, who's the vandal?</i>

16:26.981 --> 16:28.727
- This guy, officer.
- His name's Stainz!

16:28.738 --> 16:30.822
With a "Z"! That's "S" as in "Sarah,"

16:30.823 --> 16:33.491
"T" as in "Terrarium,"
"A" as in "Applegate,"

16:33.492 --> 16:35.760
- "I" as in "Igloo"...
- Him, officer. It was all him.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.458
It's a big night tonight.
Ah, we've got a busload

16:41.459 --> 16:43.205
of German tourists
and two little league teams.

16:43.216 --> 16:45.670
Annette, we both know
there's only one customer

16:45.671 --> 16:47.130
out there who matters tonight.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.967
Mr. Anaheim himself, Doug Hester.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.428
Table ten.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.097
- You can feel his power.
- Yeah.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.601
That man singlehandedly
brought the '50s to the '90s.

16:59.602 --> 17:04.146
OK, listen up. This is your moment,
and I want you to take it.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.523
And then afterwards,

17:06.525 --> 17:08.318
table 20's asking
for more ranch dressing.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.403
- Copy that.
- OK.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.614
<i>Attention, owner of the red hatchback</i>

17:12.615 --> 17:15.784
<i>with the "Who saved who" bumper

17:15.785 --> 17:18.994
<i>And while I have you, what are dreams?</i>

17:18.996 --> 17:21.330
<i>Dreams are the small steps
we take every day</i>

17:21.332 --> 17:23.959
<i>on the path to where we belong.</i>

17:23.960 --> 17:25.877

17:25.877 --> 17:28.922

17:42.895 --> 17:45.105
Wait! Stop!

17:45.106 --> 17:47.274
Listen, everyone, I love Esther.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.985
And she is a serviceable dancer.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.737
But she is hiding a terrible secret.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.907
Wait. Neel, you know?

17:55.908 --> 18:00.745
I knew something was up, but only now,
did I just put the details together.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.414
How can you live with yourself?

18:02.415 --> 18:06.251
I'm so sorry, Neel. I was so
distracted, I left a puddle.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.128
I had no idea you would fall.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.796
This is because of you?!

18:09.797 --> 18:11.812
Wait, let's back up. You go first?

18:11.823 --> 18:14.718
I was just gonna tell everybody that
you've been stealing milkshakes.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.179
Katie! The tubs!

18:22.226 --> 18:27.273
Ladies. Gentlemen. Mr. Doug Hester, GM.

18:28.468 --> 18:30.984
This woman has stolen the equivalent

18:30.985 --> 18:33.570
of four 20-gallon tubs

18:33.571 --> 18:37.866
of cookies 'n cream milkshake
from our beloved establishment.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.327
She has not been paying
for those milkshakes?

18:40.328 --> 18:42.412
You have, like, four a shift.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.332
I was told drinks are
complimentary for staff.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.544
Fountain drinks. Not dessert
and specialty beverages.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.589
Oh. Oops?

18:52.590 --> 18:57.761
You owe Jimmy Fifties
$1,275 and 84 cents.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.929
I did the math.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.223
I mean, Esther, you're obviously fired.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.019
I...

19:05.311 --> 19:07.020
What the heck, man?

19:07.021 --> 19:09.273
I thought you said we were symbiotic.

19:11.609 --> 19:16.029
I watched you steal my sneakers, my
moves, and all those milkshakes.

19:16.030 --> 19:20.450
There was no way I was gonna let
you steal my spot in Ana-<i>heim.</i>

19:20.451 --> 19:21.535
See ya, Esther.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.955
You'll always be my favorite part

19:25.956 --> 19:28.042
of "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights."

19:31.379 --> 19:32.796
Hey!

19:35.966 --> 19:37.342
Oh, wow, look!

19:37.343 --> 19:40.004
Stainz got hired
to make a mural downtown.

19:40.015 --> 19:41.805
I think I should reach out
to him with some ideas.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.597
We kinda had a
Lennon/McCartney thing going.

19:43.608 --> 19:45.809
Can you explain that, but in "Beyoncé"?

19:45.810 --> 19:48.478
I'm Beyoncé, and Stainz is
one of Destiny's other Children.

19:48.479 --> 19:53.429
Which Childs? Kelly, Michelle,
LeToya, LaTavia, Farrah...?

19:53.440 --> 19:56.361
Did you not hear the first part
of the story? Kelly, obviously.

19:58.296 --> 20:00.532
Oh, my God! I think I finally nailed it.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.701
These taste exactly like
the cookies 'n cream shakes

20:02.702 --> 20:04.078
- at Jimmy Fifties.
- Really?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.250
Tastes like you poured milk
into a bag of cookies

20:10.251 --> 20:12.312
- and shook it.
- OK, Mr. Judgey.

20:12.323 --> 20:14.371
You know what? Why don't we see
if the fish like it?

20:14.382 --> 20:16.172
You can't give fish milkshakes.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.882
Pootie liked milkshakes.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.009
You give Pootie milkshakes?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.820
Wait, let's back up. You go first?
