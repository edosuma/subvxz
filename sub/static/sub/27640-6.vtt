WEBVTT

00:00.867 --> 00:02.920
Oh Johnny, I
wish you had told us

00:02.945 --> 00:04.612
it was uh, movie day.

00:04.714 --> 00:05.880
Stevie and I could've come up

00:05.905 --> 00:07.507
with some good recommendations for you.

00:07.532 --> 00:08.432
What are we gonna watch,

00:08.457 --> 00:09.804
a silent movie from your childhood?

00:09.867 --> 00:11.067
It's not movie day, Roland.

00:11.092 --> 00:13.256
We're watching an instructional video

00:13.281 --> 00:14.670
on professional workplace etiquette,

00:14.695 --> 00:17.125
and it's clear from
the stain on your top

00:17.150 --> 00:21.254
that things have gotten just
a little lax around here.

00:22.704 --> 00:24.524
I made this at Rose Video a while back,

00:24.549 --> 00:27.625
but uh, I think you'll find
it holds up pretty well.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.996
<i>Employee
Health and Safety Series.</i>

00:31.021 --> 00:33.099
Where is it? Let's see.

00:33.124 --> 00:34.468
Oh wow, this looks like the videos

00:34.492 --> 00:36.259
Joce and I used to make.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.970
Just focus on the content, Roland.

00:37.995 --> 00:40.339
"Q, R, S," ah!

00:40.364 --> 00:41.965
There it is.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.023
Here, let me help you with that.

00:45.403 --> 00:47.750
Excuse me, Emilio!

00:48.406 --> 00:49.460
Pause.

00:50.608 --> 00:54.010
That kind of physical
touch is inapprop-ri-rate.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.489
Let's rewind, and try again.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.392
And now they're gonna come
and do it again!

01:03.852 --> 01:05.920
Where is it? Let's see.

01:07.046 --> 01:09.569
"Q, R, S," oh!

01:09.594 --> 01:10.660
There it is.

01:10.685 --> 01:12.906
Here, let me help you with that.

01:14.098 --> 01:16.199
Is this what you were looking for?

01:16.224 --> 01:18.144
A double-cassette of
the "Best Body Swaps

01:18.169 --> 01:20.537
of Sunrise Bay", Season 21?

01:20.562 --> 01:22.281
Yes, thank you.

01:22.306 --> 01:24.559
I've been asked to
retrieve it for a customer

01:24.584 --> 01:26.452
with wonderful taste.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.718
I value you as a fellow employee.

01:29.112 --> 01:30.590
Perhaps you'd like to
meet outside of work

01:30.615 --> 01:32.289
for a dinner at my place?

01:32.950 --> 01:35.118
Fast forward!

01:35.143 --> 01:36.777
- Oh!
- Jesus.

01:36.945 --> 01:39.498
Well, it's somewhat dated, but uh...

01:39.523 --> 01:41.157
I think the principles of etiquette

01:41.182 --> 01:43.421
are still applicable today.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.528
Hm. Pretty timeless. Yeah.

01:52.703 --> 01:54.656
No, I'm not gonna be
the one to tell her.

01:54.681 --> 01:55.815
Tell me what?

01:55.840 --> 01:58.125
No, it's not about you, Moira.

01:58.150 --> 02:00.122
Well, is it about Twyla
needing to pick up the pace

02:00.147 --> 02:02.054
- on that solo?
- What?

02:02.079 --> 02:04.833
No, it's about the
Poison concert tonight

02:04.858 --> 02:06.959
being canceled at the casino.

02:06.984 --> 02:08.937
And that's a problem because?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.130
Jocelyn's been looking
forward to it for weeks.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.698
This is her one night out.

02:12.723 --> 02:15.410
Not to worry. If she's
anything like I was

02:15.435 --> 02:16.802
with a little moppet in the house,

02:16.827 --> 02:19.396
she'll find any ruse to
escape for an evening.

02:19.421 --> 02:21.974
The Poison concert was merely a device.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.137
Uh oh, ladies!

02:27.238 --> 02:28.938
Somebody better call Poison Control,

02:29.040 --> 02:30.840
because tonight's gonna be...

02:30.865 --> 02:34.194
♪ Nothin' but a good time! ♪

02:35.112 --> 02:36.952
Yeah, I'm not gonna be
the one to... oh, okay.

02:36.981 --> 02:38.882
Jocelyn, you might want to take a seat.

02:38.907 --> 02:40.708
Oh no, there's no time for that.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.928
No, no, we have to
rehearse our Poison medley.

02:42.953 --> 02:45.407
Because when Rikki Rockett
makes direct eye contact

02:45.432 --> 02:47.133
with you during "Talk Dirty to Me",

02:47.158 --> 02:49.793
you are gonna want to talk dirty back!

02:49.894 --> 02:51.861
Oh gals, this is getting painful.

02:51.962 --> 02:54.807
Jocelyn, wonderful news!
They've refunded the price

02:54.832 --> 02:57.067
of your ticket for tonight's concert.

02:57.168 --> 02:59.421
What? But I don't want a refund.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.347
No, the show got pushed.

03:01.372 --> 03:04.359
Looks like they double-booked
Poison with The Doodlebops.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.652
And the casino just sent out an apology.

03:06.677 --> 03:08.645
Well, what are we supposed to do now?!

03:08.746 --> 03:10.880
I didn't pump for four hours straight

03:10.981 --> 03:12.415
to get on a chartered bus

03:12.440 --> 03:14.775
to go to the end of the street and back!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.529
We could go to the cafe.

03:16.554 --> 03:19.775
Oh! Well, do they have a
smoke machine at the cafe?!

03:19.800 --> 03:22.461
No, but I can ask George to
burn something on the grill.

03:22.486 --> 03:23.869
This is just sad.

03:23.894 --> 03:25.895
Why can't we still go to the casino?

03:25.920 --> 03:27.588
If I'm holding the truth stick,

03:27.613 --> 03:30.309
I was never planning to
attend the concert anyway.

03:30.334 --> 03:33.828
I never pegged you for a
gambling kind of gal, Moira.

03:33.853 --> 03:37.207
Oh, I'm not above a
naughty night of debauchery.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.018
When Condi Rice, and Sharon Stone and I,

03:39.043 --> 03:41.354
used to make our annual casino sojourn

03:41.379 --> 03:43.113
to Ho Chi Minh City,

03:43.290 --> 03:46.881
well, let's just say,
toi khong bao gio thua.

03:47.529 --> 03:49.595
Okay, but it's been a really long time

03:49.620 --> 03:51.488
since I've spun that roulette wheel.

03:51.589 --> 03:53.767
And this is the only casino
I haven't been banned from

03:53.791 --> 03:55.631
as an unaccompanied minor.

03:55.926 --> 03:57.406
Well, do we still have a reservation

03:57.461 --> 03:59.362
at Bucky's Fried Chicken House?

03:59.463 --> 04:02.298
Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop us!

04:05.926 --> 04:07.646
So you just
plug in the information,

04:07.671 --> 04:09.231
and then it creates the website for you.

04:09.256 --> 04:11.491
So what exactly am I
paying you for, then?

04:11.516 --> 04:13.018
I'm your brand consultant, David.

04:13.043 --> 04:15.888
I'm consulting with you
on which template to use.

04:17.481 --> 04:19.593
Sorry, I'm just distracted,
there's a guy over there

04:19.617 --> 04:21.517
currently flirting with my boyfriend.

04:21.593 --> 04:23.796
- Poor thing.
- I know.

04:23.821 --> 04:26.156
No, I meant you, David.

04:26.257 --> 04:29.297
Oh hi, are you finding
everything you're looking for?

04:29.322 --> 04:30.794
Um, actually, I was wondering

04:30.819 --> 04:32.152
if I could have a pen and paper?

04:32.177 --> 04:34.774
Hm, you planning on
doing some journaling?

04:34.799 --> 04:36.065
Hmm.

04:37.368 --> 04:39.158
- There you go.
- Thank you.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:52.383 --> 04:55.694
Um... score, Patrick!

04:55.719 --> 04:58.788
Look at you, just drowning in
other people's phone numbers.

04:58.813 --> 05:02.282
Who was that hunk with the
teeny-weeny little polo?

05:02.444 --> 05:04.970
- His name is Ken.
- Ken!

05:04.995 --> 05:06.529
Just when I thought it was impossible

05:06.554 --> 05:08.641
to find a thirty-something named Ken!

05:08.681 --> 05:10.482
Oh, I think he looked younger than 30.

05:10.568 --> 05:11.701
Get fucked Alexis!

05:11.802 --> 05:13.870
What exactly did Ken do with my pen?

05:13.895 --> 05:15.714
Did he write down a banana bread recipe?

05:15.739 --> 05:18.675
Or was he looking for
directions to some place?

05:18.700 --> 05:21.001
- This is his phone number.
- Yes, it is.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.556
Yeah. Look at you go.

05:23.581 --> 05:25.014
- Mhmm.
- And he like...

05:25.115 --> 05:26.395
gave it to you in front of David,

05:26.450 --> 05:28.154
so clearly no threat there.

05:28.179 --> 05:29.686
Hey Alexis, find a stick...

05:29.787 --> 05:32.121
Can I at just enjoy this for a second?

05:32.146 --> 05:34.366
Of course, yeah! Enjoy Ken.

05:34.391 --> 05:35.902
I mean, I think it's
funny 'cause when he first

05:35.926 --> 05:38.179
walked in here I was gonna help him,

05:38.204 --> 05:40.673
so to think it could've
been me enjoying Ken.

05:40.698 --> 05:42.232
Yeah, I don't think so.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.243
- Yeah, I think he liked me.
- This is fun!

05:44.268 --> 05:45.879
It's the great thing about
owning a store, really,

05:45.903 --> 05:47.804
is getting to flirt with the customers.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.097
You know, just last week,

05:49.122 --> 05:50.860
A woman came in and gave me her number.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.751
Do you mean the woman who wanted to know

05:52.776 --> 05:54.154
when the soap would be back in stock?

05:54.178 --> 05:56.113
Who came in here with
her husband and kids?

05:56.680 --> 05:58.348
Hasn't stopped me before.

05:58.449 --> 06:00.360
But thank you for reminding
me, I have to call her,

06:00.384 --> 06:01.792
the soap did come back in.

06:03.454 --> 06:05.088
I'm just gonna...

06:05.113 --> 06:06.613
put that right there.

06:06.638 --> 06:08.406
Mhmm.

06:09.367 --> 06:10.734
<i>Stevie?</i>

06:10.858 --> 06:12.025
<i>Just a minute!</i>

06:12.050 --> 06:15.398
Oh, I was talking to Roland
about the latticework,

06:15.423 --> 06:18.444
and we figure if we uh,
put the vines right up

06:18.469 --> 06:19.980
- the side of the motel... oh!
- Oh! Oh!

06:20.004 --> 06:21.804
Oh my God, Mr. Rose! Oh!

06:21.829 --> 06:24.829
Okay. No, no, no, that's okay.

06:24.854 --> 06:25.988
I'm sorry.

06:26.013 --> 06:28.311
- I said just a minute!
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.422
No, I-I was coming back to you,

06:30.447 --> 06:31.954
because I-I figured, you know,

06:31.979 --> 06:34.814
you'd be busy back there. I was busy!

06:35.319 --> 06:37.390
- Taking a personal photo...
- Right, right.

06:37.415 --> 06:38.655
For my doctor.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.042
Right, well, it was, it
was a medical uh, photo,

06:41.067 --> 06:42.701
and, and uh... and you what?

06:42.726 --> 06:45.246
You text or email this
right back to your doctor,

06:45.271 --> 06:47.740
I mean, what a-what an age we live in!

06:47.765 --> 06:49.299
I thought you were running errands!

06:49.324 --> 06:51.810
I was, I was, and-and uh...

06:51.835 --> 06:53.736
I was at the nursery, there were no cars

06:53.761 --> 06:56.315
absolutely on the way home, and uh,

06:56.340 --> 06:57.740
so it was clear sailing,

06:57.765 --> 07:00.052
and that's what I was
gonna tell you when I...

07:00.077 --> 07:01.344
- until I...
- Okay!

07:01.369 --> 07:04.189
I am kind of seeing somebody,

07:04.214 --> 07:06.325
and it's like, a
long-distance thing, so I...

07:06.350 --> 07:08.328
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna stop,
I'm gonna stop you right there.

07:08.352 --> 07:10.632
I wish we had gotten to the second tape

07:10.657 --> 07:12.431
in the workplace etiquette series,

07:12.456 --> 07:15.077
that had a whole chunk on Polaroids.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.303
- Oh my God!
- Um, Stevie, look, look!

07:17.328 --> 07:19.762
All I saw was a business
partner communicating

07:19.787 --> 07:21.640
with a friend, that's all.

07:21.665 --> 07:23.399
Although you've just explained

07:23.424 --> 07:25.253
that it was a more intimate relationship

07:25.278 --> 07:26.445
with this uh, chap.

07:26.470 --> 07:28.556
But uh, congratulations, by the way.

07:28.581 --> 07:29.848
If-if uh, you know.

07:29.873 --> 07:33.361
I think I need to take
a walk around the block.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.854
- Mhmm?
- So, like, a couple of thousand times.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.999
Okay, that's a good
idea. Yeah, sure, sure.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.892
Take a walk. And uh, you know,

07:39.917 --> 07:42.203
uh, get some, get some fresh air,

07:42.228 --> 07:43.796
and you know, clear your head.

07:43.821 --> 07:46.274
And if you feel the need
to finish that communication

07:46.299 --> 07:47.866
by the way, with your friend,

07:47.891 --> 07:50.712
just uh, maybe try and find
a room with a locked door?

07:51.962 --> 07:54.330
But everything's okay Stevie,
don't worry about that.

07:54.355 --> 07:56.532
We're...

07:57.434 --> 07:59.335
- I waited 35 minutes!
- Oh, don't start.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.817
Oh, please, save your
applause for Jocelyn,

08:04.842 --> 08:06.818
who's right behind me.

08:06.843 --> 08:08.821
You know what? I was going
to change and then I thought,

08:08.846 --> 08:11.790
no, if my babysitter can
show up wearing a crop top

08:11.815 --> 08:15.503
the size of a bib, I can
wear this to a casino!

08:16.754 --> 08:18.121
Jocelyn, you look amazing.

08:18.146 --> 08:21.367
Yes, why not throw caution
and the dress code to the wind?

08:21.392 --> 08:23.570
I'm sure the maître d' at
Bucky's will make an exception!

08:23.594 --> 08:26.887
Let's get goin'!

08:28.353 --> 08:31.200
If the bus is a-rockin',
don't come a-knockin'!

08:31.225 --> 08:32.859
Wooo! Yeah!

08:34.688 --> 08:37.916
I've come prepared
with casino must-haves:

08:37.941 --> 08:40.528
oxygen drops, antibacterial wipes,

08:40.553 --> 08:43.621
and military-grade caffeine pills.

08:43.647 --> 08:45.214
The pills came from Condi,

08:45.239 --> 08:47.893
so if anyone asks, you
found them on the floor.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.963
Mrs. Rose, when you said
you were bringing essentials,

08:49.987 --> 08:52.789
I thought you meant snacks,
and something to drink.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.366
No.

08:54.391 --> 08:56.391
- Well, nothing for the road?
- Don't worry ladies,

08:56.427 --> 08:58.961
I've got you covered, this
afternoon I made some...

08:58.986 --> 09:02.274
magic brownies!

09:02.299 --> 09:04.200
THC and carbohydrates.

09:04.225 --> 09:06.712
Oh Moira, we don't
expect you to have one.

09:06.737 --> 09:08.204
One? At least one.

09:08.305 --> 09:10.056
Okay...

09:10.081 --> 09:13.042
Who wants some zhampagne?

09:13.067 --> 09:14.468
Yeah! Wooo!

09:20.384 --> 09:22.819
So, whatever happened
to that phone number?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.655
Uh, it might still be in my pocket. Why?

09:25.756 --> 09:28.057
Hm. Just keeping it close?

09:28.082 --> 09:29.850
Well, I haven't thrown it out yet.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.413
What are you doing?! I'm
obviously not gonna use it.

09:34.431 --> 09:35.631
Why not?

09:35.810 --> 09:37.710
Uh, because I'm in a
committed relationship.

09:37.735 --> 09:38.842
I know that.

09:40.637 --> 09:43.639
- I think you should call him.
- What?!

09:43.741 --> 09:45.575
Skin-tight clothes aside,

09:45.676 --> 09:47.553
do you find Ken attractive?

09:48.221 --> 09:49.655
I mean, sure.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.214
Then I think you should call him!

09:51.315 --> 09:52.284
David!

09:52.309 --> 09:54.426
Consider it a selfish act on my part.

09:54.451 --> 09:56.085
You have only been with me.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.330
And Rachel, and like, a
handful of other girls.

09:58.355 --> 10:00.656
Okay, we've all been with
a handful of other girls.

10:00.758 --> 10:02.925
- But I'm the only guy.
- So?

10:03.026 --> 10:05.113
So inevitably there might come a point

10:05.138 --> 10:06.972
where you find yourself curious

10:06.997 --> 10:08.831
about being with other people.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.809
So why not explore that now,

10:10.834 --> 10:13.054
so that we don't have
to have this conversation

10:13.079 --> 10:14.646
five years down the line.

10:14.671 --> 10:17.706
Oh, so you think we're gonna
be together 5-years from now?

10:17.731 --> 10:19.952
I think a cute boy gave you his number,

10:19.977 --> 10:23.312
and you should go for
dinner, and run free.

10:23.489 --> 10:24.823
Best case scenario,

10:24.848 --> 10:26.816
you realize how good
you have it with me.

10:26.841 --> 10:28.742
Worst case scenario,

10:28.767 --> 10:30.419
you realize how good
you have it with me.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.652
Fun!

10:37.409 --> 10:39.677
Okay, Mr. Rose?

10:40.940 --> 10:43.342
Uh, I've thought a lot
about what happened,

10:43.367 --> 10:45.553
uh, maybe a little too
much about what happened.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.180
And I think for the
sake of the business,

10:48.205 --> 10:51.309
that we should just
put it all behind us.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.453
- Okay, good.
- Good.

10:54.478 --> 10:56.078
Thank you, Stevie.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.591
What happened?

11:00.333 --> 11:02.161
Mr. Rose saw me topless.

11:02.186 --> 11:04.405
- Oh! Oh!
- No! No!

11:04.430 --> 11:07.065
I... I didn't completely see anything,

11:07.090 --> 11:09.792
but I got the gist of
what you were doing.

11:09.893 --> 11:11.460
I didn't know anyone was here!

11:11.562 --> 11:13.596
Oh Johnny,

11:13.621 --> 11:16.451
I don't think the woman in
that video would approve.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.243
The woman on the video is Moira,

11:18.268 --> 11:20.336
and no, she would not
approve! I would not approve!

11:20.361 --> 11:21.862
It was an accident.

11:21.887 --> 11:24.449
Trust me, it will never happen again.

11:24.474 --> 11:25.641
Understood.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.719
I really don't know what
to say to the two of you.

11:27.744 --> 11:29.289
Well, you don't have
to say anything, Roland.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.723
Less is more in a...
situation like this.

11:31.748 --> 11:33.228
Well, I did just think of one thing.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.894
- Please don't!
- It's more of a limerick.

11:34.918 --> 11:36.352
All right, enough, Roland.

11:36.377 --> 11:37.911
Thank you, we're going to move on now.

11:37.936 --> 11:40.399
Stevie, Room Three needs a change over.

11:40.424 --> 11:42.314
I would be happy to leave and do that.

11:43.656 --> 11:45.623
Thanks.

11:45.648 --> 11:47.530
Whoa!

11:47.555 --> 11:50.075
Aah! Stevie! Your friend just responded!

11:50.100 --> 11:52.201
- Oh my God, gimme that!
- Hmm.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.946
Oh my...

11:56.416 --> 11:58.450
uh, I'll be taking the
rest of the day off.

11:58.475 --> 12:01.119
Okay.

12:01.144 --> 12:03.045
Yeah...

12:03.146 --> 12:04.780
I'd say her friend responded.

12:13.361 --> 12:14.939
Hey, can you
give me a ride to Ted's?

12:14.964 --> 12:16.631
It's basically on the way to Patrick's.

12:16.656 --> 12:18.108
It's in the opposite direction,

12:18.133 --> 12:20.134
and I'm not going to Patrick's tonight.

12:20.159 --> 12:21.293
Why?

12:21.470 --> 12:23.237
Because we don't have plans tonight.

12:23.262 --> 12:26.180
- He has plans with someone else.
- Who?

12:26.205 --> 12:27.767
Okay, can you utilize like,

12:27.792 --> 12:29.486
a little bit more of
the English language?

12:29.511 --> 12:31.045
If you must know,

12:31.070 --> 12:32.815
I sent Patrick off to
have dinner with that guy

12:32.840 --> 12:34.533
who gave him his number today.

12:34.761 --> 12:36.896
That hot piece from the store?

12:36.994 --> 12:38.327
Why would you do that?

12:38.428 --> 12:40.229
Because I think it's funny,

12:40.330 --> 12:42.570
and I also think it's important
for Patrick to experience

12:42.666 --> 12:44.533
other people in order to realize

12:44.635 --> 12:47.270
how good he has it with me.

12:47.371 --> 12:49.739
What if he doesn't come
to that realization?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.317
Every time I did that with a boyfriend,

12:51.341 --> 12:53.643
I'd send them off with someone
who like, wasn't a threat.

12:53.744 --> 12:56.178
Like, Pippa Middleton, or Rihanna.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.649
Okay, well, I hardly
think Ken is a threat.

12:59.750 --> 13:02.718
Mm, tell that to his
million dollar smile, David.

13:02.819 --> 13:05.321
- Okay.
- So what are the GRs?

13:05.422 --> 13:07.523
- The what?
- The ground rules.

13:07.624 --> 13:09.492
What ground rules did you lay down

13:09.593 --> 13:12.260
before you sent him off
with that hottie-boom-bottie?

13:13.597 --> 13:16.065
Okay, I haven't sent him
off with ground rules,

13:16.090 --> 13:18.458
because this is a one-night thing.

13:18.635 --> 13:20.536
Did you say that?

13:20.637 --> 13:22.071
No.

13:22.248 --> 13:24.049
So at this point he could like,

13:24.074 --> 13:25.541
spend the night, double-dip,

13:25.566 --> 13:27.452
- kiss on the lips!
- I don't know!

13:27.477 --> 13:29.578
Okay, this is why you
have ground rules, David!

13:29.603 --> 13:31.690
Josh Groban has a thick,
leather-bound binder

13:31.715 --> 13:32.924
full of them.

13:32.971 --> 13:34.594
Patrick didn't even wanna do this.

13:34.626 --> 13:36.894
I basically forced him into it.

13:36.987 --> 13:38.955
Is it too late for any amendments?

13:39.056 --> 13:40.623
I thought this was a good idea,

13:40.648 --> 13:43.101
and now you're making me
feel like I made a mistake.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.071
Okay, you haven't made a
huge mistake yet, David,

13:45.095 --> 13:47.937
we probably won't find out
about that until tomorrow.

13:49.499 --> 13:52.177
Okay, I have never been
in this position before,

13:52.202 --> 13:54.112
usually I'm the one finding out

13:54.137 --> 13:56.491
I'm in an open
relationship after the fact,

13:56.516 --> 13:59.151
and now you're making me
feel like I've just shipped

13:59.176 --> 14:02.244
my boyfriend off to fall
in love with someone else!

14:03.120 --> 14:05.466
Ugh! I was supposed to go
to dinner with Ted, David!

14:05.491 --> 14:07.092
Then go for dinner with Ted!

14:07.117 --> 14:09.218
Well, now I feel like I
should be here for you!

14:09.395 --> 14:11.029
Why?

14:11.130 --> 14:13.398
Let's just hope we don't find out.

14:13.499 --> 14:15.233
What?!

14:15.258 --> 14:16.592
Ugh...

14:26.636 --> 14:28.456
Are we up yet?

14:28.481 --> 14:30.658
It's either black or red, even or odd.

14:30.683 --> 14:33.118
And you never know
where you're gonna land.

14:33.143 --> 14:34.610
I'm sorry, Jocelyn?

14:34.711 --> 14:36.012
If you'd've told me 20 years ago

14:36.113 --> 14:37.757
I'd be standing here
with an empty chip bucket,

14:37.781 --> 14:39.915
stoned out of my mind
at a Doodlebops concert,

14:40.017 --> 14:42.618
I would've lit a
menthol, and had a laugh.

14:42.719 --> 14:44.086
You went to that show?

14:44.187 --> 14:45.221
I stepped in briefly,

14:45.322 --> 14:48.090
Roland Jr.'s a huge
fan of "Wobbly Whoopsy."

14:48.191 --> 14:49.977
Moira, you may not believe this,

14:50.002 --> 14:52.471
but I used to rock out.

14:52.572 --> 14:54.106
Well, of course you did,

14:54.131 --> 14:56.645
as did anyone with brain cells to kill.

14:56.976 --> 14:58.810
I'm thinking of a
particular night in Monaco

14:58.835 --> 15:01.804
with Maggie Trudeau
and the Rolling Stones.

15:01.905 --> 15:04.373
You rocked with the Stones?

15:04.398 --> 15:07.362
All except Charlie, but
every party has a pooper.

15:08.454 --> 15:10.355
Moira, it's like,

15:10.380 --> 15:13.449
on the inside I feel
like I'm 19-years-old,

15:13.550 --> 15:16.402
and then I catch a glimpse
of myself in the mirror,

15:16.427 --> 15:19.898
and realize that I'm so not.

15:19.923 --> 15:24.102
Oh Jocelyn, you'll soon
learn that we aging mortals

15:24.127 --> 15:26.772
are blessed with
weakening eyes and memories

15:26.797 --> 15:29.971
so we don't have to
really see ourselves.

15:30.367 --> 15:34.179
If you love the number 19, you go be 19.

15:34.204 --> 15:37.206
And while you're at it, bet on it.

15:37.383 --> 15:39.084
I can't take all of these!

15:39.109 --> 15:41.070
It only looks like a lot.

15:41.688 --> 15:44.056
Do as you will. Jocelyn,
but whatever you do,

15:44.081 --> 15:47.492
rock onwards and upwards!

15:47.543 --> 15:49.377
Mhmm!

15:49.634 --> 15:51.068
Yeah!

16:04.158 --> 16:06.026
- Ah, Stevie.
- Oh my God!

16:06.203 --> 16:07.712
I forgot my bag,

16:07.737 --> 16:09.816
and I thought you might have
gone home for the night, so...

16:09.840 --> 16:11.674
Oh no, I was just
about to leave, but uh,

16:11.699 --> 16:13.195
I'm glad I caught you.

16:14.153 --> 16:16.961
Can we pretend today didn't happen?

16:17.367 --> 16:19.968
Oh, consider it erased.

16:19.993 --> 16:21.026
Thank you.

16:21.051 --> 16:23.662
Although, I did wanna
say just one thing,

16:23.687 --> 16:27.056
if I could put my friend
cap on for a minute.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.633
I'm glad things are working out

16:28.658 --> 16:30.542
with you and your gentleman friend.

16:31.027 --> 16:33.901
And I'm just piecing
things together here.

16:34.764 --> 16:36.499
Thank you, Mr. Rose.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.100
I hope he makes you happy, Stevie,

16:38.125 --> 16:40.010
and that's all that matters to me.

16:40.546 --> 16:42.814
And from this point forward,
I am staying out of it.

16:42.839 --> 16:45.018
We never have to talk about this again.

16:46.032 --> 16:47.800
Okay.

16:48.034 --> 16:50.088
Remember Emir?

16:50.113 --> 16:52.214
The guy who came to review the motel?

16:52.315 --> 16:54.783
The one who asked you to lunch?

16:54.885 --> 16:57.386
Yes, that would be him.

16:57.487 --> 17:01.199
Oh! Well, he seems like a nice guy.

17:01.224 --> 17:02.791
- Yeah.
- Good job.

17:02.893 --> 17:04.660
Good taste in motels.

17:04.761 --> 17:07.762
And clearly he likes you a lot.

17:07.788 --> 17:10.122
And I'm not saying that
just because of the photo.

17:10.146 --> 17:11.333
Oh my God, Mr. Rose!

17:11.381 --> 17:13.444
- Okay, rewind, please.
- See you tomorrow!

17:13.470 --> 17:15.570
Yeah, okay, see you tomorrow, Stevie.

17:17.140 --> 17:18.574
Does anyone want more Bucky's?

17:18.675 --> 17:22.310
No! Who knew everything
would contain chicken?

17:22.336 --> 17:24.737
Oh, that dessert menu was
especially disappointing.

17:24.915 --> 17:26.549
"Black forest tenders."

17:26.574 --> 17:28.492
Jocelyn's still not answering her phone.

17:28.518 --> 17:31.574
Well, somebody ought to go look for her!

17:33.722 --> 17:35.925
Tah-dah!

17:35.950 --> 17:39.337
Oh, Jocelyn, is that you?

17:39.362 --> 17:41.749
Yes! I took your advice, Moira.

17:41.774 --> 17:43.642
And what advice was that?!

17:43.667 --> 17:46.639
Yes, Jocelyn, what advice did I impart

17:46.664 --> 17:50.406
that translated into
this daring new coiffure?

17:50.583 --> 17:52.617
That I can still rock on!

17:52.642 --> 17:54.243
Your chips bought this!

17:54.268 --> 17:56.955
And you certainly risked
it all, didn't you?

17:56.980 --> 17:59.281
Yeah!

17:59.306 --> 18:01.039
I'm ready to go home.

18:01.451 --> 18:02.551
Okay.

18:02.652 --> 18:04.420
Wow, Jocelyn.

18:04.521 --> 18:06.021
It must feel so light and breezy.

18:06.046 --> 18:07.890
Mhmm!

18:07.991 --> 18:09.825
Ha ha! Yeah.

18:09.926 --> 18:11.727
Yes, I love it, too.

18:11.752 --> 18:14.506
I know. Thank you.

18:14.531 --> 18:17.199
Thank you.

18:17.376 --> 18:19.277
Do you recognize me from earlier?

18:19.302 --> 18:21.003
I have a new hairdo!

18:22.439 --> 18:23.724
Hey Ted, I'll be there soon,

18:23.749 --> 18:26.017
but I just can't leave
David alone right now.

18:26.042 --> 18:28.877
Yeah, no, apparently they
left for dinner at seven.

18:28.902 --> 18:30.269
Radio silence.

18:30.294 --> 18:31.994
Nothing, not a word.

18:32.325 --> 18:35.794
Anyway, I will be there
soon, and I love you so much.

18:35.819 --> 18:36.885
Okay...

18:36.987 --> 18:38.520
Oh my God, imagine?

18:38.622 --> 18:40.856
Muah! Muah!

18:41.854 --> 18:43.688
This is not how I
wanted to spend my night.

18:43.860 --> 18:44.960
Me neither.

18:44.985 --> 18:46.581
And David, I know what you're thinking,

18:46.630 --> 18:48.497
they're probably back at his house,

18:48.598 --> 18:51.543
listening to Frank Ocean,
laughing, and re-hydrating.

18:51.568 --> 18:53.369
Yeah, the more I think about this,

18:53.394 --> 18:55.580
the more I realize it was way too early

18:55.605 --> 18:57.673
to have introduced this
into the relationship.

18:57.698 --> 18:59.584
I mean, I thought I was being mature,

18:59.609 --> 19:02.830
but in actuality, it
was just a classic case

19:02.855 --> 19:04.489
of self-sabotage.

19:04.514 --> 19:06.448
Chill, David.

19:06.473 --> 19:08.074
Hey!

19:09.319 --> 19:11.854
Yes, those are all valid points,

19:11.879 --> 19:14.347
but this is a moment of growth for you.

19:14.524 --> 19:17.326
Was it flawlessly executed? No.

19:17.427 --> 19:18.827
Would I have done it?

19:18.928 --> 19:19.995
Hell no.

19:20.096 --> 19:21.964
Okay, if this is intended to be helpful,

19:21.989 --> 19:25.048
- you can leave now.
- But what I was gonna say is,

19:25.302 --> 19:27.303
if a cute guy that walks into your store

19:27.404 --> 19:30.072
is enough to unravel
your whole relationship,

19:30.173 --> 19:31.907
you're better off knowing that now,

19:32.008 --> 19:33.909
than in a year from now.

19:47.457 --> 19:49.559
Do I want to hear about it?

19:50.499 --> 19:52.107
I couldn't do it.

19:53.430 --> 19:54.963
Oh. Come in.

19:56.599 --> 19:57.933
I don't want to date Ken!

19:57.958 --> 19:59.359
I don't think I ever said "date".

19:59.384 --> 20:01.351
Was it the lack of ground rules?

20:01.376 --> 20:03.257
- Hi. David...
- Mhmm?

20:03.905 --> 20:06.341
I love you, and I really appreciate

20:06.366 --> 20:07.686
what you were trying to do for me,

20:07.711 --> 20:11.342
but I feel no need to meet
up with other guys right now.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.492
Okay, I mean...

20:14.517 --> 20:16.685
if that's what you
want, then I guess I'm...

20:16.710 --> 20:19.358
I'm fine with it, I
mean, I'm easy either way.

20:19.383 --> 20:20.772
Oh.

20:24.835 --> 20:27.081
Also, this is gonna sound totally petty,

20:27.106 --> 20:30.108
but something about his shoes
just made me feel really weird,

20:30.133 --> 20:32.668
'cause they were like,
long and pointy, but then...

20:32.693 --> 20:34.127
- Squared off at the toe.
- Yes!

20:34.152 --> 20:36.748
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know. I know, it's okay.

20:36.773 --> 20:38.674
It's okay.

20:41.694 --> 20:43.488
Okay, this is a really long hug now.

20:43.513 --> 20:45.952
Just need one more minute, mhmm.

20:53.977 --> 20:56.812
We all still like it, right?

20:57.077 --> 20:59.616
I think it really brings
out my eyes, right, Gals?

20:59.641 --> 21:01.109
Sure.

21:01.296 --> 21:02.856
It's not like we think it's a mistake,

21:02.931 --> 21:05.299
or we regret it, right?

21:05.400 --> 21:08.402
Oh, you never regret
a good time, Jocelyn.

21:08.503 --> 21:09.736
Thank you, Moira.

21:09.837 --> 21:11.872
You'd tell me the truth, I know.

21:13.165 --> 21:14.936
It's really short.
