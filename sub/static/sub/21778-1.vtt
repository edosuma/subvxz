22:14.674 --> 22:16.584
the front is much deeper
than the back?

22:17.774 --> 22:19.804
Come here. I'll show you.

22:21.044 --> 22:23.614
She ran until she dropped here.

where her face hit the snow.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.684
Now, it gets 20 below
here at night,

with that cold air

you could freeze 'em up.

you start coughing it up.

...she ran all the way here.

22:46.804 --> 22:49.634
Her lungs burst here.

22:49.674 --> 22:51.804
And she curled up
in that tree line

22:51.844 --> 22:53.884

someone could run barefoot
out here?

Uh, those findings might help
us make that determination.

27:17.334 --> 27:19.704
What are you listing
as the cause of death?

27:19.744 --> 27:21.844
Well, you're not gonna like it.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.144
She died
from a pulmonary hemorrhage.

27:24.174 --> 27:28.714
When... subzero air
is drawn into the lungs,

27:28.754 --> 27:30.094
it can cause the alveoli...

27:30.114 --> 27:32.114
the tiny sacs in the lungs...
to burst.

27:32.154 --> 27:35.284
Fluid builds in the lungs,
and if the air is cold enough,

27:35.324 --> 27:37.294
the liquid in the lungs
will crystallize.

27:37.324 --> 27:39.054
Ultimately,
the victim either...

27:39.094 --> 27:41.164
Sorry, you're not listing this
as a homicide?

27:41.194 --> 27:42.864
Can't.

27:42.894 --> 27:45.294

You have to take

27:45.334 --> 27:47.164
into consideration
the circumstances.

27:47.204 --> 27:51.134
She was raped repeatedly,
beaten...

27:51.174 --> 27:55.844
Look, uh, circumstances
is your field, not mine.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.644

- No.

27:57.674 --> 27:58.874
I don't need it explained.

27:58.914 --> 28:00.744
This is very prosecutable
as a murder.

28:00.784 --> 28:02.314
I mean, clearly,
she wouldn't have been

28:02.354 --> 28:04.624
running through the snow
if she hadn't been attacked,

28:04.654 --> 28:07.654
but I can't list the cause
of death as homicide.

28:07.684 --> 28:09.624
And I can't get an FBI team
to the reservation

28:09.654 --> 28:11.194
unless it's listed
as a homicide.

28:11.224 --> 28:13.064

55:05.674 --> 55:07.644
That's, uh...

55:07.674 --> 55:09.604
that's my daughter, Emily.

55:09.644 --> 55:13.344
She passed three years ago.

55:14.744 --> 55:17.484
I'm sorry.

55:19.454 --> 55:22.684
You want to know how,
don't you?

55:24.954 --> 55:27.664
I do, but...

55:27.694 --> 55:30.264
Makes two of us.

55:32.394 --> 55:35.334
I was, uh, working as, uh,
an outfitter in Pinedale,

55:35.364 --> 55:37.234
and there was a big snow.

55:37.274 --> 55:40.904
So I found myself
with a rare night off.

55:40.944 --> 55:43.584
So I go to a motel,
call the wife

55:43.614 --> 55:46.584
and say, "Why don't you come up
and stay for the night?"

55:46.614 --> 55:48.914
And when you got two...
two kids

55:48.944 --> 55:51.784
and you're on the mountain
half the year, it's...

55:51.814 --> 55:54.724
you don't get much time
together.

55:54.754 --> 55:57.994
So we had Emily
look after Casey.

55:58.024 --> 56:00.394
He was five at the time.
She was 16.

56:00.424 --> 56:02.924
I guess word got out

56:02.964 --> 56:05.594
that we were out of town.

56:05.634 --> 56:07.604
So some school friends
came over.

56:07.634 --> 56:09.604
Then some more friends.

56:09.634 --> 56:12.874
Then, uh...

56:12.904 --> 56:15.644
and then some people came over
that weren't friends.

56:15.674 --> 56:20.644
So a little gathering turned
into quite the party, I guess.

56:20.684 --> 56:23.794
Then, uh...

56:23.814 --> 56:26.954
I don't know.

56:26.984 --> 56:30.424
You know,
there's a lot I don't know.

56:35.324 --> 56:37.764

the next morning.

56:41.534 --> 56:44.904

56:46.504 --> 56:48.474

56:48.504 --> 56:52.544
They were best friends.

56:52.574 --> 56:56.614
You know, we tried to be
very careful with Emily.

56:57.654 --> 57:00.814
Tried to plan for everything.

57:06.024 --> 57:08.794
She was such a good girl.

57:10.964 --> 57:13.734
But we let our guard down.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.934
Really, I tell you,

57:15.964 --> 57:20.474
you know,
you may have kids one day.

57:36.994 --> 57:40.634
Some 20 miles from our house.

57:40.664 --> 57:44.034
They don't know how she got
there or what happened.

57:44.064 --> 57:46.034

it's, like, fruit farms
and vineyards,

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.340

and it's, like...

that they were all, like...

01:13:30.774 --> 01:13:33.344
I don't know. They had
these looks in their eyes.

♫ When counted by days

01:41:09.234 --> 01:41:12.604
♫ A looming and ominous shade

01:41:14.504 --> 01:41:17.104
♫ Worry been breaking

01:41:17.144 --> 01:41:19.674
♫ And bringing me down

01:41:19.714 --> 01:41:24.124
♫ And counting
all the times that I fall ♫

01:41:25.384 --> 01:41:30.624
♫ But when my time comes

01:41:30.654 --> 01:41:34.394
♫ I won't be counting at all

01:41:37.764 --> 01:41:40.564
♫ I feel all my filth

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:43.334
♫ When I look in your eyes

01:41:46.734 --> 01:41:48.634
♫ But it falls

01:41:48.674 --> 01:41:51.304
♫ Light as a feather

01:41:51.344 --> 01:41:54.544
♫ On my back in the night

01:41:59.314 --> 01:42:02.254
♫ Man, you said meet me there

01:42:02.284 --> 01:42:04.724
♫ How do I get from here

01:42:04.754 --> 01:42:06.654
♫ To where

01:42:06.694 --> 01:42:09.434
♫ Where I belong?

01:42:10.594 --> 01:42:13.064
♫ It ain't just like finding

01:42:13.094 --> 01:42:15.664
♫ A sign to get home

01:42:15.694 --> 01:42:19.404
♫ It's building your house
on the stone ♫

01:42:21.704 --> 01:42:23.804
♫ Worry been breaking

01:42:23.844 --> 01:42:27.254
♫ And bringing me down

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:31.084
♫ And counting
all the times that I fall ♫

01:42:32.714 --> 01:42:38.284
♫ But when my time comes

01:42:38.324 --> 01:42:42.254
♫ I won't be counting at all

01:42:45.394 --> 01:42:47.364
♫ I feel all my filth

01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:51.034
♫ When I look in your eyes

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:56.534
♫ But it falls

01:42:56.574 --> 01:42:58.544
♫ Light as a feather

01:42:58.574 --> 01:43:01.544
♫ On my back in the night

01:43:06.254 --> 01:43:08.864
♫ Your house,
it will cover you ♫

01:43:08.884 --> 01:43:12.454
♫ But the rain
still falls outside ♫

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.464
♫ Your light, it don't shine

01:43:19.494 --> 01:43:21.764
♫ 'Cause it's hidden

01:43:21.794 --> 01:43:23.834
♫ Under a bed

01:43:28.674 --> 01:43:30.544
♫ Why

01:43:30.574 --> 01:43:32.774
♫ Do you hide

01:43:32.804 --> 01:43:35.444
♫ Under a bed?

01:43:39.914 --> 01:43:42.454
♫

01:44:05.374 --> 01:44:07.714
(SONG ENDS)

01:44:10.484 --> 01:44:12.544
♫

01:44:40.514 --> 01:44:42.544
♫

01:45:10.544 --> 01:45:12.574
♫

01:45:40.574 --> 01:45:42.604
♫

01:46:10.604 --> 01:46:12.634
♫

01:46:40.634 --> 01:46:42.994
(MUSIC ENDS)
