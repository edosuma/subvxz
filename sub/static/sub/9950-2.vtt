WEBVTT

00:04.240 --> 00:08.858
I wasn't a fan of the Queen until I
realised how much we have in common.

00:08.922 --> 00:11.481
Bringing up kiddies you
can't remember the names of.

00:11.482 --> 00:15.003
I know she's not a single
parent but she might as well be.

00:15.004 --> 00:18.362
Plus, the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns,

00:18.363 --> 00:22.003
her literally sometimes,
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:22.004 --> 00:24.162
Admired and despised equally.

00:24.163 --> 00:26.362
Not for never lifting a finger.

00:26.363 --> 00:29.442
No, for setting examples
through extremity.

00:29.443 --> 00:32.121
And whether you're a bigwig on
her end or a bigwig on mine,

00:32.122 --> 00:34.721
you've still got your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,

00:34.722 --> 00:36.841
snip, snip, snipping
at your benefits.

00:36.842 --> 00:40.843
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking,
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:41.603 --> 00:43.922
I got shot of my kids yonks back.

00:43.923 --> 00:46.481
Whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.482 --> 00:49.563
I've had to get out of bed on
occasion to make ends meet

00:49.564 --> 00:53.563
whereas she, she's done the
whole thing from a chair.

00:54.443 --> 00:56.361
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:56.362 --> 00:58.881
Oh sure, there's perks.
But, look at her lot.

00:58.882 --> 01:01.403
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:01.404 --> 01:03.922
Now look at my lot.

01:03.923 --> 01:07.923
We know how to throw
a proper fucking paaaarty!

01:07.948 --> 01:12.296

01:16.163 --> 01:17.841
The more I think about it,

01:17.842 --> 01:21.843
the more I realise that pretty much
everyone's got a secret identity.

01:24.003 --> 01:27.201
And I'm not, you know, meaning
like Batman or Superman.

01:27.202 --> 01:30.001
Although when I was ten,
I did put my pants on my head

01:30.002 --> 01:32.281
and run around pretending
to be a superhero.

01:32.282 --> 01:35.763
The Catholic Avenger. Exorcised
the next door neighbour's cat.

01:35.779 --> 01:37.497
Worked as well.

01:37.545 --> 01:41.245
No, I mean the secret identity
being you. The real you.

01:41.311 --> 01:45.311
The one behind all
that bluster and front.

01:46.111 --> 01:49.349
Like the woman who pretended
she didn't need love.

01:49.350 --> 01:53.351
But found it closer to home than
she could have ever imagined.

01:53.911 --> 01:57.911
Or the boy who's doing his best to
be a loving husband and good father.

01:59.671 --> 02:02.149
Those good looks and
easy smile distracting you

02:02.150 --> 02:06.151
from the stench of blood and death
that came with his family name.

02:07.631 --> 02:11.631
Or the friendly local
janitor, always got a smile
and wink for the kiddies.

02:11.711 --> 02:15.711
Some of them say they want to
be like him when they grow up.

02:20.911 --> 02:23.271
Or the man who thought
he was happy enough.

02:23.272 --> 02:26.270
Drinking, womanising, getting by.

02:26.816 --> 02:30.816
Until he realised he'd never
known what happiness was at all.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.815
Coming.

02:36.816 --> 02:39.215
Oh, shit. Coming!

02:39.216 --> 02:40.356
Package for a Gloria Meak.

02:40.431 --> 02:42.149
She doesn't live here.

02:42.150 --> 02:45.390
I mean, she does. Sorry. She does.
She's just not here right now.

02:45.391 --> 02:47.309
Oh, pay no attention to him.

02:47.310 --> 02:49.228
Mince for brains till
he has his first cuppa.

02:49.229 --> 02:50.790
Yeah. My wife's the same.

02:50.791 --> 02:54.790
No, no, we're not married.
No we're brother and sister.

02:54.950 --> 02:58.589
What? It's not weird,
is it? Us living together.

02:58.590 --> 03:02.590
Especially not in this economic
climate. I'm a priest anyway,
you know, a man of the cloth.

03:03.030 --> 03:07.030
I told you. Mince.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.310 --> 03:19.749
What's with you?

03:19.750 --> 03:23.750
Nothing.

03:39.070 --> 03:42.789
As you all know, tomorrow
is a red letter day.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.429
The school inspector calls,

03:45.430 --> 03:49.430
so big smiles, friendly
faces, we'll get through it.

03:50.550 --> 03:54.550
And, er, there is one other thing.

03:54.990 --> 03:58.990
In light of recent solicitor's
letters that I've received,

04:00.310 --> 04:04.310
it seems that our
exclusion of Adam Wiggins

04:06.310 --> 04:08.829
may not have been entirely legal.

04:08.830 --> 04:10.722
- You better be joking.
- This is shit.

04:17.230 --> 04:19.668
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

04:19.670 --> 04:23.190
That little fucker comes back,
you'll have a walkout on your hands.

04:23.191 --> 04:26.429
You can't do that,
we've got an inspection.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.109
Seems to me you're
doing it all wrong.

04:29.110 --> 04:32.430
Punishing the lad, excluding
him, not going to work.

04:32.431 --> 04:36.430
Now what you need is a nice
little frilly pink dress

04:37.270 --> 04:40.708
and a pair of heels. Dress up
this Adam like a little girl.

04:40.709 --> 04:43.708
Two or three days tottering
round the corridors, having

04:43.709 --> 04:47.710
the shite ripped out of him by all
and sundry, he'll be humble as pie.

04:48.270 --> 04:52.270
S'all right. You
can thank me later.

04:52.870 --> 04:56.870
Just to remind you, you are
PTA. Not actual staff.

04:57.990 --> 05:01.470
I was just helping, I've got
experience with these things,

05:01.471 --> 05:03.989
kids of my own.

05:03.990 --> 05:07.510
I understand the whole world
of education must seen fascinating

05:07.511 --> 05:09.269
and new to you.

05:09.270 --> 05:10.190
What's that mean?

05:10.191 --> 05:12.869
How old were you
when you left school?

05:12.870 --> 05:16.709
Exactly. But this
is not a free for all.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.828
And I'm not blind.
I'm well aware of you

05:18.829 --> 05:21.750
slithering your tentacles
into places they're not welcome.

05:21.751 --> 05:23.829
You better watch your tone.

05:23.830 --> 05:26.710
And you better watch out
you don't over-step the mark.

05:26.711 --> 05:30.710
Because one little word
from me and you're gone.

05:31.550 --> 05:35.550
Gone with the wind.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.190
He's not going to call.

05:47.191 --> 05:49.509
He might.

05:49.510 --> 05:53.510
I know things got a little
bit out of hand but, you know,

05:53.710 --> 05:56.028
now me and Kassi have had
a time to cool down.

05:56.029 --> 05:58.148
Jamie, he popped in here for a drink

05:58.149 --> 06:00.268
and you tried to beat
the shite out of him.

06:00.269 --> 06:02.750
He's hardly going to be
throwing lunch dates

06:02.751 --> 06:06.750
and friend requests
in your direction.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.523
- He's not answering my calls.
- Because he knows your number.

06:13.390 --> 06:17.190
But he doesn't know mine.

06:24.470 --> 06:28.470
Hello?

06:28.830 --> 06:32.830
It's me. Jamie.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.709
Don't hang up.

06:34.710 --> 06:38.710
Hey, all right, Mimi!
How's it hanging?

06:39.510 --> 06:42.469
Hey!

06:42.470 --> 06:45.469
This place doesn't
clean itself, you know.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.750
What are we doing,
Frank? Look at us.

06:47.751 --> 06:49.669
We look like dicks.

06:49.670 --> 06:53.670
I don't. Eh, come on, you shouldn't
let them get you down, kid.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.388
You're a big strong woman.

06:57.389 --> 06:58.150
No, I'm not.

06:58.151 --> 07:02.150
Yes, you are! Come on!

07:02.470 --> 07:05.989
In fact, I'm going close
the book on this place.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.028
Take them for everything I can.

07:08.029 --> 07:12.030
Show those fuckers
what over-stepping the
line really looks like.

07:12.270 --> 07:14.469
Yeah, good for you.

07:14.470 --> 07:18.470
Hey, I've been very
impressed by that...

07:19.710 --> 07:22.790
you know, that mushroom
industry that you've got going.

07:22.791 --> 07:25.229
You're a trailblazer, you know.

07:25.230 --> 07:28.829
Amelia Earheart, Marie Curie,
Pocahontas...

07:28.830 --> 07:31.190
I haven't got Hovis
stamped on my arse.

07:31.191 --> 07:35.190
You can stop buttering me
up, Frank. What do you want?

07:35.630 --> 07:39.630
Well, seeing that you're doing very
well with this mushroom thing,

07:39.790 --> 07:43.790
maybe tip a few caps this way
to your old friend and neighbour...

07:49.310 --> 07:53.310
Fill your boots, Frank.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.989
Enjoy it while it lasts.

07:58.990 --> 08:02.990
Cos I'm getting the goldmine,
and these are getting the shaft.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.789
Laters, Frank.

08:07.790 --> 08:11.790
Yeah, laters.

08:12.830 --> 08:15.108
But you get on all right. As family.

08:15.109 --> 08:17.628
When you finally got to
spend some time together.

08:17.629 --> 08:20.948
I thought she was lovely,
till she opened her mouth.

08:20.949 --> 08:23.348
And he was so drunk,
he thought I was twins.

08:23.349 --> 08:25.948
Come on, Jamie, you're a class
act. What's not to like, eh?

08:25.949 --> 08:27.628
Black eye, couple of bruises.

08:27.629 --> 08:29.828
Jamie. He's agreed
to meet you again.

08:29.829 --> 08:32.388
He's coming in for a
drink. Don't overthink it.

08:32.389 --> 08:34.270
You know what you should try doing?

08:34.270 --> 08:35.828
Mam, it's all right.

08:35.830 --> 08:36.748
I was just saying.

08:36.749 --> 08:39.388
I don't want this opened
up this to the floor.

08:39.389 --> 08:43.030
I just wanted to hear from a
couple of folk who'd been there.

08:45.950 --> 08:49.148
Right, listen up. My brother's
coming in here tonight.

08:49.149 --> 08:50.868
I'm already here, you div.

08:50.869 --> 08:53.430
My other brother.
And I want to show him

08:53.431 --> 08:55.949
this place isn't a fucking cesspool.

08:55.950 --> 08:59.950
No fighting, no drugs,
no pissing, and no puking.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.989
Have you got that?

09:01.990 --> 09:04.110
It's you he needs to worry about.

09:13.630 --> 09:15.309
No, it's good to laugh.

09:15.310 --> 09:17.190
A pub full of happy
people, joking about.

09:17.191 --> 09:21.149
You've got the right idea,
John. So go on. Laugh again.

09:21.150 --> 09:24.110
I want to hear you.
A big old fucking chuckle.

09:24.111 --> 09:28.110
Hahaha...?

09:28.390 --> 09:30.270
Oh, you can do better than that.

09:30.271 --> 09:31.389
Haha, haha...

09:31.390 --> 09:32.670
All of you!

09:34.590 --> 09:38.590
I didn't say stop. Come, on.
Laugh it up, you fucking fuzzballs.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.470
All together now.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.908
Computer room. At the back,
first corridor.

09:54.909 --> 09:57.270
Got a brand new server,
whatever the fuck that is.

09:57.271 --> 10:01.270
So get in after midnight,
rip it out, sell it on. Right?

10:02.350 --> 10:05.750
You got masks? Don't want any
of this coming back to me.

10:05.751 --> 10:07.869
Right then.

10:07.870 --> 10:09.548
And don't smash the place up.

10:09.549 --> 10:13.550
Some of the kids have worked quite
hard on their projects and...

10:14.230 --> 10:18.230
Just keep it clean.

10:29.590 --> 10:32.149
Are you sure about us being here?

10:32.150 --> 10:35.869
Oh, yeah, cos being
at home's so much better,

10:35.870 --> 10:39.350
with Aiden tramping around with
his tag on, the little one mewling

10:39.351 --> 10:42.669
and whining all the fucking time.

10:42.670 --> 10:45.989
It's just we always hated school.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.510
Worst years of our lives.

10:47.511 --> 10:51.469
I promise you, after
this evening's over,

10:51.470 --> 10:55.349
you'll think of school in
a whole different light.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.869
We're not pissing on you, Frank.

10:57.870 --> 11:01.870
What? Eh? What's pissing
got to do with it?

11:01.990 --> 11:04.228
Just whenever you
start talking like this,

11:04.229 --> 11:06.110
usually ends with me pissing on you.

11:06.111 --> 11:08.549
That's not strictly true.

11:08.550 --> 11:10.030
But let's not rule anything out.

11:10.031 --> 11:14.030
What happens in school,
stays in school.

11:18.030 --> 11:19.629
He's not coming.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.470
Maybe he's just running late.

11:21.471 --> 11:25.229
Maybe it's for the best.

11:25.230 --> 11:27.708
It's not like you can
share life stories, is it?

11:27.709 --> 11:30.430
"Oh, I tell you what, let's talk
about the time I was banged up,

11:30.431 --> 11:32.749
"or the time I offed three fellas,

11:32.750 --> 11:35.508
"or maybe the time
when I dug up the corpse

11:35.509 --> 11:38.388
"of some guy's dad, because he had
his sticky fingers on my missus."

11:38.389 --> 11:41.230
Shane, let's play
shut-the-fuck-up. You go first.

11:41.231 --> 11:44.149
Just saying...

11:44.150 --> 11:48.150
I'm going to clear up.

12:05.390 --> 12:08.789
Hey.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.229
Whoa! Easy, easy,

12:10.230 --> 12:13.149
Sorry, mate.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.548
Karen told me you were
out here shifting crates.

12:15.549 --> 12:18.350
I know it's late.
We're closing but we can
still get a couple of beers.

12:18.351 --> 12:21.909
How about tomorrow?
Day out. Banley Manor?

12:21.910 --> 12:25.127
- Tam's off school for a few days,
I have to look after him anyway.
- Why Banley?

12:26.790 --> 12:30.429
Is this to do with me dad?

12:30.430 --> 12:32.469
Yes. Yes, it is.

12:32.470 --> 12:36.470
That's where... his
ashes were scattered.

12:39.030 --> 12:43.030
Tomorrow then?

12:44.229 --> 12:45.548
Got a taxi waiting.

12:45.549 --> 12:47.727
Tomorrow.

13:01.029 --> 13:02.711
They're gone.

13:09.038 --> 13:09.917
Frank...

13:09.918 --> 13:11.557
Almost done.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.373
I dunno about this.
Makes me look like a prossie.

13:14.474 --> 13:16.712
No!

13:16.713 --> 13:19.753
You look like a painted lady.

13:25.913 --> 13:27.431
Don't that look like Siobhan?

13:27.432 --> 13:30.071
Fuck, it does. Got
the corn-rows and everything.

13:30.158 --> 13:31.639
Talented little bastards.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.958
They're not talented!

13:33.959 --> 13:36.638
This, this is talent.

13:36.639 --> 13:40.438
Rembrandt'd be spinning in his tomb.

13:40.439 --> 13:43.118
This stuff, this is rubbish.

13:43.119 --> 13:45.158
It's just bollocks, innit?

13:45.159 --> 13:48.038
Fingers like penises,

13:48.039 --> 13:52.039
smiling faces...

13:53.319 --> 13:56.078
Yeah, that's kids for you.

13:56.079 --> 13:58.558
They see things differently.

13:58.559 --> 14:01.038
Blue sky.

14:01.039 --> 14:03.559
Big old Mr Sunshine.

14:05.839 --> 14:09.839
Everything's beautiful.

14:10.319 --> 14:14.319
Everything's just perfect.

14:15.319 --> 14:19.319
Frankie! Frankie!

14:26.119 --> 14:27.479
Are you looking at me?

14:27.480 --> 14:30.238
Wait, this is...
This is important...

14:30.239 --> 14:33.758
Here I am, Frank! Frank!

14:33.759 --> 14:36.358
This is fucking brilliant.

14:36.359 --> 14:40.359
It's like... a moment.

14:44.399 --> 14:47.998
No, don't change...

14:47.999 --> 14:51.278
Stay the same, don't grow old,

14:51.279 --> 14:55.279
cos your fucking kids
just fucking up and away...

14:56.879 --> 14:58.119
Frank!

15:04.919 --> 15:07.118
Frank!

15:07.119 --> 15:09.878
Are you looking at me now, Frank?

15:09.994 --> 15:11.113
Aah!

15:11.114 --> 15:12.433
Have you finished?!

15:12.434 --> 15:16.434
No! I'm not fucking finished!

15:47.194 --> 15:50.113
You fucking leech!

15:50.114 --> 15:52.513
Iraq not enough for you?

15:52.514 --> 15:56.514
I am not fucking finished!

16:30.274 --> 16:31.473
All set?

16:31.474 --> 16:35.153
Yeah. Think so.

16:35.154 --> 16:37.474
Packed lunch. Just some sandwiches.

16:37.475 --> 16:40.473
You ever been to
Banley Manor before?

16:40.474 --> 16:44.392
Oh, God, it's boring. Went there
years ago on a school trip.

16:44.393 --> 16:45.954
Connor might enjoy it, though.

16:45.955 --> 16:49.233
Don't think you have
to come. I can do this.

16:49.234 --> 16:53.234
Like I said, boring for me.
But for Connor, though...

16:54.074 --> 16:58.074
OK. But I'm not
sharing my sandwiches.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.594
Just go and get some stuff together.

17:01.595 --> 17:04.393
He's bringing his kid too.

17:04.394 --> 17:06.752
My nephew, I suppose.

17:06.753 --> 17:08.152
Have you got him something?

17:08.153 --> 17:11.112
What? You think
I should get him a present?

17:11.113 --> 17:13.512
I dunno, it'd be polite?
I mean, these middle classes...

17:13.512 --> 17:17.154
That'd be great, showing up
empty-handed! He'll think
I'm a right fucking loser.

17:17.155 --> 17:21.154
We're meeting him at 11,
you haven't got time!

17:28.233 --> 17:30.593
Eh, what's going on?

17:30.594 --> 17:33.673
It's Christmas, sir.
Christmas morning.

17:33.674 --> 17:34.993
Seriously?

17:34.994 --> 17:38.353
Nah. Assembly in the hall, innit.

17:38.354 --> 17:40.633
Coo-ee, Frank!

17:40.634 --> 17:44.634
Look here, Frank! Let me
lick your lollipop, Frank!

17:48.314 --> 17:49.553
Oh!

17:49.554 --> 17:52.354
Eh-up, eh-up! Eh-up,
janny coming through!

17:52.355 --> 17:56.354
Janny coming through!

18:00.194 --> 18:02.513
Frank, I'm stuck!

18:02.514 --> 18:03.633
Just jump.

18:03.634 --> 18:06.033
I can't. I've got impetigo.

18:06.034 --> 18:07.233
What?

18:07.234 --> 18:09.432
Look, the place is
going to be crawling

18:09.433 --> 18:11.394
with kids and teachers in a minute.

18:11.395 --> 18:14.714
I'll catch you, trust me. Trust me!

18:17.954 --> 18:21.633
Ah! Oh, fucking hell.

18:21.634 --> 18:25.634
Ah, Jesus...

18:26.634 --> 18:29.353
Come on, up and at 'em.

18:29.354 --> 18:33.354
You said you'd catch me!
I've got bruises, more bruises.

18:34.794 --> 18:38.794
Fucking hell, Frank,
you throw like a girl.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.714
I haven't got time for this.

18:45.634 --> 18:49.634
Oh, shit.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.193
You got any Frisbees?

18:59.194 --> 19:00.832
You know I don't sell
that kind of stuff.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.352
Have you got anything similar?

19:02.353 --> 19:03.992
Jamie, I don't deal drugs. All right?

19:03.993 --> 19:06.552
- Bet he does.
This place has to be a front.
- It's not a bloody codeword.

19:06.553 --> 19:09.234
It's a Frisbee! It's an
object you throw and catch.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.473
Oh, right. Frisbee. No.

19:12.474 --> 19:14.712
I also don't sell
that kind of thing here.

19:14.713 --> 19:17.474
Here. I'm in a rush.
I can't be late. So how much?

19:17.475 --> 19:21.474
Just take it, man.

19:24.754 --> 19:28.754
Biscay. East or North West,
four or five.

19:30.954 --> 19:33.193
Slight or moderate.

19:33.194 --> 19:36.313
Mainly fair.

19:36.314 --> 19:40.314
Good, occasionally very poor.

19:40.354 --> 19:41.953
Trafalgar.

19:41.954 --> 19:43.833
Variable southerly...

19:43.834 --> 19:44.953
Frank!

19:44.954 --> 19:46.633
Three or four.

19:46.634 --> 19:50.633
Occasionally five.
Slight or moderate,

19:50.634 --> 19:54.473
fair, good.

19:54.474 --> 19:57.474
Well, that concludes
today's shipping forecast.

19:57.475 --> 19:59.113
Fucking hell...

19:59.114 --> 20:03.114
I'd like to welcome
someone back into the fold.

20:03.514 --> 20:07.514
And I'm sure that once you've heard
what Adam Wiggins has to say,

20:10.754 --> 20:14.754
I'm sure that you'll agree
he deserves a second chance.

20:15.794 --> 20:19.794
Adam?

20:39.154 --> 20:41.113
No way.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.673
Please, please...

20:42.674 --> 20:46.154
Not again. Oh, come on...

20:51.834 --> 20:53.353
You're not dismissed!

20:53.354 --> 20:57.354
Community, you've got to pull
together, haven't you?

20:58.274 --> 21:00.673
Go Scargill!

21:00.674 --> 21:03.233
Outside!

21:03.234 --> 21:06.433
Great! Just great!

21:06.434 --> 21:10.434
Go on, fight the
system. Solidaritnost.

21:23.514 --> 21:25.154
Shouldn't you be in school?

21:25.155 --> 21:27.393
There was a walk-out.

21:27.394 --> 21:30.593
- There's only like three
teachers and 40 kids left.
- When?

21:30.594 --> 21:34.594
In assembly. Heard them say they'll
probably shut the school down now.

21:37.234 --> 21:38.913
Hang on a minute, love.

21:38.914 --> 21:40.594
What are you doing, Miss?

21:40.595 --> 21:44.594
Protecting my investment.

21:45.074 --> 21:49.074
Ah, so, how are
things at, uh...

21:49.514 --> 21:53.193
um, inspector HQ?

21:53.194 --> 21:56.713
Right! Let us begin. English.

21:56.714 --> 22:00.714
How about geography instead?
Mr Farman's class is fascinating.

22:01.674 --> 22:03.234
Oh, would you like to meet...?

22:03.235 --> 22:05.113
Year four English.

22:05.114 --> 22:07.392
Actually I think the year four
teacher might be off.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.912
Well, then you'll have
a substitute teacher, won't you?

22:09.913 --> 22:12.512
Or are you so incompetent
you can't even manage that?

22:12.513 --> 22:15.512
Wait, look, there's something
I need to tell you.

22:15.513 --> 22:18.994
Of course, if I was to tell you
the next story we were looking at

22:18.995 --> 22:22.994
featured murder, paranoia,
insanity, revenge and ghosts,

22:24.274 --> 22:27.034
you'd probably think I was
talking about an X-rated oeuvre

22:27.035 --> 22:29.873
of Mr Tarantino
or Mr Stallone, but no.

22:29.874 --> 22:33.874
It's called Hamlet and it's by
a bright young gun named Mr William
Shakespeare. Anybody know him?

22:39.794 --> 22:43.794
Ah, gentlemen.
Please, take a seat.

22:45.394 --> 22:49.394
OK, so, where was I?

22:49.834 --> 22:53.834
Hamlet, Hamlet...

22:54.274 --> 22:57.472
It warms the very sickness
in my heart, that I shall live

22:57.473 --> 22:59.234
and tell him to his teeth,

22:59.235 --> 23:03.234
"Thus diest thou."

23:04.634 --> 23:07.594
Slightly carried away there,
but everybody open your books,

23:07.595 --> 23:10.673
turn to page one,
hang onto your hats.

23:10.674 --> 23:12.793
Cos it's Hamlet time.

23:12.794 --> 23:15.954
Right now, your career
is bent over the table,

23:15.955 --> 23:18.273
trousers down, cheeks splayed,

23:18.274 --> 23:22.273
about the get the arse fucking
to end all arse fuckings.

23:22.274 --> 23:25.194
You're too old to re-train
for anything else,

23:25.195 --> 23:28.313
and no other school
will touch you

23:28.314 --> 23:32.314
with the proverbial dirty
barge pole, so I'm your only hope.

23:33.594 --> 23:37.594
Now, I've called in favours
from friends, good friends,

23:38.034 --> 23:42.033
to bail you out of your own mess.

23:42.034 --> 23:45.633
I just hope I haven't
over-stepped the mark.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.953
Everything all right, Mr Banbury?

23:47.954 --> 23:49.193
Everything's fine.

23:49.194 --> 23:53.194
Then pay attention.
You might learn something.

23:55.354 --> 23:56.993
My liege...

23:56.994 --> 24:00.994
Art, chemistry, physical
education, mathematics.

24:02.514 --> 24:06.514
Oh, and there was recently a big
investment in a school server.

24:08.194 --> 24:11.152
I would very much like
to see that up and running.

24:11.153 --> 24:15.154
Computer room. At the back,
brand new server, worth thousands.

24:15.674 --> 24:19.674
Rip it out, sell it on.

24:19.954 --> 24:21.292
No problem at all.

24:26.054 --> 24:30.054
I need you to get that server
back to me A-S-A-fuckin'-P.

24:30.374 --> 24:34.374
I don't care
if you've got football tonight.

24:34.894 --> 24:38.534
Billy, do you want to spend
the rest of your married life

24:38.610 --> 24:41.328
sleeping on the couch?

24:41.329 --> 24:45.048
Right. Thank you.

24:45.049 --> 24:49.049
You. Here. Now.

24:50.929 --> 24:54.287
Bet you're happy with yourself.
School's in chaos.

24:54.288 --> 24:56.847
Most of the teachers
have buggered off.

24:56.848 --> 25:00.849
Come on, let's see if you're still
smiling when I'm done with you.

25:02.129 --> 25:05.688
You might have half the school
shittin' themselves

25:05.689 --> 25:08.929
every time you look round,
might have the teachers on the run,

25:08.930 --> 25:10.848
but I'll give you this.

25:10.849 --> 25:13.808
You do scrub up pretty well.

25:13.809 --> 25:17.688
Now you totter along
to the kitchen to help out,

25:17.689 --> 25:21.689
for all those lovely dinner ladies
walked out when you walked in.

25:22.089 --> 25:26.089
And, eh, son? Make sure that food's
de-fuckin'-licious, Michelin star,

25:27.689 --> 25:31.689
or you'll be walkin'
round in my knickers and bra.

25:35.969 --> 25:39.969
So I guess you come here a lot...

25:40.089 --> 25:43.048
to visit Dad's ashes?

25:43.049 --> 25:47.049
Yeah, yeah, we make the trip
every... week or so.

25:48.369 --> 25:49.448
It's boring.

25:49.449 --> 25:51.927
Doesn't have to be boring.
Jamie's brought you summat.

25:51.928 --> 25:52.889
Give it to him.

25:52.890 --> 25:55.728
This?

25:55.729 --> 25:57.969
No, no, I didn't bring this
to play with.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.648
It's, um...

26:00.649 --> 26:03.648
It's some kid's birthday
on our street.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.688
He's... mentally deficient.

26:05.689 --> 26:09.689
That's really good of you, mate.

26:24.329 --> 26:27.488
These are a little basic,
aren't they?

26:27.489 --> 26:31.489
At this level, they should really
be up to a higher standard.

26:36.849 --> 26:40.849
In order to draw like the child,
one must think like the child, ja?

26:42.169 --> 26:45.288
They are children.

26:45.289 --> 26:49.289
You are a man who understands art.

26:50.409 --> 26:53.648
Well, I...

26:53.649 --> 26:55.569
Well, I do dabble, yes.

27:01.569 --> 27:03.968
Billy, give me some good news.

27:03.969 --> 27:05.927
They've sold the server on already.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.769
The problem is
it's to another school.

27:07.770 --> 27:11.769
Look, just delay your man.
I'm on it.

27:12.329 --> 27:13.369
Right, I'll wait here.

27:13.370 --> 27:14.768
It's your wife.

27:14.769 --> 27:16.967
Well, I can't just walk
into a strange school, can I?

27:16.968 --> 27:18.267
Everyone'll think I'm a paedo.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.180
You can't hang around
the school gates either.

27:20.270 --> 27:24.269
You'll look even more paedotastic,
so grow some.

27:32.449 --> 27:34.368
Which one's the server?

27:34.369 --> 27:35.732
That big thing there.

27:38.889 --> 27:42.889
Maybe you should
have unplugged it first.

27:43.849 --> 27:47.769
Has everyone just ran off and left
you? Animals, man, the lot of 'em.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.598
Billy.

27:48.599 --> 27:49.279
It's wrong.

27:49.280 --> 27:52.718
The wheels.

27:52.719 --> 27:55.599
We're going to hell, we're going
to hell, we're going to hell!

28:50.719 --> 28:52.327
Go, go!

29:01.399 --> 29:05.399
So, dad... Our dad.

29:06.519 --> 29:10.519
Where d'you scatter the ashes?

29:15.959 --> 29:17.758
Over the flowerbed.

29:17.759 --> 29:21.718
It's what he wanted.
He used to sit here on the bench.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.318
He loved it here.

29:24.319 --> 29:28.319
I suppose I should go
and say something.

29:45.879 --> 29:49.879
I have no fuckin' idea
what I'm doing here.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.919
I mean, you're a pile of ashes
in a flowerbed.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.118
You obviously can't hear me.

29:55.119 --> 29:57.958
Are you exclusive?

29:57.959 --> 29:59.758
You and the big lad?

29:59.759 --> 30:03.759
Cos I ain't got a girlfriend
at the moment and I can be...

30:05.279 --> 30:08.998
very discreet.

30:08.999 --> 30:12.838
Blah blah blah.
Talking to a fucking flowerbed.

30:12.839 --> 30:16.839
Blah blah blah blah blah.

30:17.999 --> 30:20.678
So, uh..

30:20.679 --> 30:24.158
Yeah, I hope you
would have been proud of me.

30:24.159 --> 30:27.718
It's unlikely but I hope so.

30:27.719 --> 30:31.719
Nice one, mate.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.678
Late for school.

30:41.679 --> 30:43.319
There's punishment for that.

30:43.320 --> 30:47.319
I was kind of hoping there would be.

30:48.039 --> 30:52.039
Just pay the fucking bills on time,
you alcoholic twatbag.

30:52.279 --> 30:53.357
All right, Mimes.

30:53.358 --> 30:56.757
No, not all right. Does anyone know
anything about computers?

30:56.758 --> 30:58.077
Yeah, I know a little bit.

30:58.078 --> 31:00.997
Good, because we've got about
three minutes to get this server

31:00.998 --> 31:03.917
up and running before the inspector
gets to the computer room

31:03.918 --> 31:07.919
and I've no fuckin' idea
what a server actually does. C'mon.

31:10.279 --> 31:14.038
No, no, other cable.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.477
You don't think
she suspects anything, do you?

31:16.478 --> 31:19.237
Apart from you being an alkie who
can't pay your bills on time? No.

31:19.238 --> 31:21.317
Second time this week
we've almost been caught.

31:21.318 --> 31:23.139
You don't think we're
one of those couples who, y'know?

31:23.213 --> 31:25.401
Get off on danger? Nah.

31:26.959 --> 31:30.038
In fact, it makes me
even more frustrated.

31:30.039 --> 31:31.797
I want to do normal things.

31:31.798 --> 31:35.799
Why don't we, then? Tonight.
Grand Hotel. Meal, get drunk.

31:36.639 --> 31:39.078
It's weird, isn't it?

31:39.079 --> 31:41.798
It just... feels right.

31:41.799 --> 31:45.799
Yeah. It does that.

31:47.279 --> 31:49.039
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.078
Yeah, yeah. Never been better.

31:52.079 --> 31:56.079
OK, so we have lift off.

31:57.799 --> 31:59.638
Oh, come on!

31:59.851 --> 32:01.291
Oh!

32:14.661 --> 32:18.661
Just another hour
and we're in the clear.

32:18.901 --> 32:21.499
You're really into all this,
aren't you?

32:21.500 --> 32:25.379
The school, the way the kids
look up to you, the teachers.

32:25.380 --> 32:28.019
It's called
protecting your investment.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.579
You sure that's all it is?

32:29.580 --> 32:31.179
Course I'm fuckin' sure.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.339
These corridors are paved with gold

32:33.340 --> 32:35.101
and it's all going
straight into my pocket.

32:35.102 --> 32:36.700
All right.

32:36.701 --> 32:39.061
If anyone's too into this,
it's your Dom.

32:39.062 --> 32:43.061
Yeah. A real showman, that one.

32:43.621 --> 32:47.621
He just loves pretending
to be somebody else.

32:55.461 --> 32:58.099
Is there a union
we can join or something?

32:58.100 --> 33:01.381
Lil, you do realise
we're not real teachers, right?

33:01.382 --> 33:05.381
You might not be a real teacher.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.079
Pizza? Really?

33:19.080 --> 33:21.080
Well, it covers four of the...

33:21.081 --> 33:23.199
Stop babbling.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.079
You're getting a pass.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.398
A weak one with notes in the margin
but it's still a pass.

33:28.399 --> 33:30.840
I've always tried to maintain
the highest standards.

33:30.841 --> 33:34.840
The less you speak,
the better it'll be for everybody.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.399
Oh, shite!

34:11.400 --> 34:14.159
Get out! Get out!

34:38.199 --> 34:40.638
We shouldn't be exposed
to these kinds of things.

34:40.639 --> 34:43.480
We're fuckin' courtesans,
ladies of pleasure.

34:43.481 --> 34:47.480
Fire! Fire! Coming through! Fire!

34:52.840 --> 34:56.840
What was that? Al-Qaeda or
the fucking paddies starting up?

35:12.120 --> 35:15.959
Let Hercules himself do what he may.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.839
The cat will mew

35:17.840 --> 35:21.840
and dog will have his day.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.839
That is from Hamlet

35:25.840 --> 35:29.932
and it means you are all
in a hell a lot of trouble!

35:38.861 --> 35:40.620
I feel sorry for you.

35:40.621 --> 35:44.061
You went to all that effort
to set up those microwaves,

35:44.062 --> 35:46.060
the cans in them...

35:46.061 --> 35:47.780
big boom...

35:47.781 --> 35:50.980
and you didn't even scratch me.

35:50.981 --> 35:54.981
I mean, that's pathetic.

35:55.741 --> 35:59.020
There are kids your age
in Sierra Leone,

35:59.021 --> 36:03.021
with AK-47s and twice the balls
you'll ever have!

36:04.141 --> 36:06.819
You know,
when I first heard about you,

36:06.820 --> 36:10.821
I thought "Maybe here's a lad who's
going to show me something new.

36:12.221 --> 36:16.221
"Something interesting.
Maybe he'll even surprise me."

36:18.381 --> 36:22.381
But you can't, can you, Adam?
Because you're mediocre.

36:24.618 --> 36:26.618
And you always will be.

36:34.418 --> 36:38.418
So how does it feel?
Now you've spoken to dad.

36:39.058 --> 36:43.058
Yeah, great. Like, y'know,
a weight off my mind.

36:44.778 --> 36:48.778
No, I can't do this, Kas.
I didn't feel a thing.

36:48.978 --> 36:51.618
I'm a bad person -
this was a mistake.

36:51.619 --> 36:53.297
Jamie...

36:53.298 --> 36:54.416
I've done time in jail,

36:54.417 --> 36:57.216
I've been involved in shit that
would turn your shite white.

36:57.217 --> 36:58.856
You're clever, you're driven,

36:58.857 --> 37:00.696
you've got this great kid
who's all sorted.

37:00.697 --> 37:03.418
I'm just a fuck-up.
It's not funny, it's...

37:03.419 --> 37:06.137
Jamie.

37:06.138 --> 37:10.138
I lied to you.
Dad's ashes weren't scattered here.

37:12.618 --> 37:14.098
Then where are they scattered?

37:14.099 --> 37:18.098
Dunno. I don't even know where
they are.

37:18.338 --> 37:20.818
Left 'em in the back of a taxi
when I was doing a runner.

37:20.819 --> 37:21.617
Why?

37:21.618 --> 37:23.976
Well, because it was eight quid
fifty and I only had

37:23.977 --> 37:26.618
a fiver on me and you know
they always fiddle the meter anyway.

37:26.619 --> 37:30.618
Why did you tell me they were here?
Acting all serious...

37:32.458 --> 37:34.858
Because I thought
that's what you wanted.

37:34.859 --> 37:38.577
I'm only here because I thought
it's what you wanted!

37:38.578 --> 37:42.578
Mate... I'm a fuck up too.
Not just losing Dad's ashes.

37:44.418 --> 37:46.817
I mean, I've been bankrupt.

37:46.818 --> 37:50.818
And Tam, well they gave him
a little holiday from school

37:52.418 --> 37:55.338
for sending photos of his cock
to the English teacher!

37:57.858 --> 38:01.858
Looks like he's just shown it
to my missus.

38:09.578 --> 38:12.977
The point is - fucking up happens.

38:12.978 --> 38:16.856
And I figure, two brothers,
walking around acting all serious

38:16.857 --> 38:19.578
trying to make the other one
feel better...

38:19.579 --> 38:23.578
well, it can't all be bad, right?

38:26.778 --> 38:30.778
You really are a fuck up.

38:38.538 --> 38:42.538
Fight, fight, fight!

38:47.258 --> 38:51.258
Listen, you can't blame Banbury
for this. He let a kid come back.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.417
Teachers walked out.

38:54.418 --> 38:57.217
Look. I'm going to be nice

38:57.218 --> 39:00.777
and save you the trouble of a
beautiful speech.

39:00.778 --> 39:04.778
Some wonderful oration to
melt my heart and stay my pen.

39:06.538 --> 39:10.538
It's not going to happen.
There are rules!

39:10.898 --> 39:13.417
Regulations!

39:13.418 --> 39:15.537
Correct ways of doing things.

39:15.538 --> 39:19.057
He touched me!

39:19.382 --> 39:20.421
What?!

39:20.422 --> 39:23.741
Him. He touched me.
In my private area.

39:23.742 --> 39:25.341
In the toilets.

39:25.342 --> 39:29.342
This is ridiculous!
Obviously just another set-up.

39:29.702 --> 39:31.261
Nothing to do with me.

39:31.262 --> 39:33.300
Nobody is going to believe him.

39:33.301 --> 39:36.620
All allegations of abuse must be
dealt with seriously.

39:36.621 --> 39:39.900
If the child is in immediate trouble
the police should be called.

39:39.901 --> 39:43.702
Otherwise it must be taken to
the council Children's Services.

39:43.703 --> 39:45.181
These are the rules,

39:45.182 --> 39:49.182
the regulations... the correct
way of doing things.

39:49.742 --> 39:51.540
I'm sure your name will be cleared.

39:51.541 --> 39:55.462
Family, friends, colleagues won't
ever think less of you.

39:55.463 --> 39:59.462
No nagging doubts.
Smoke without fire, so to speak.

40:02.502 --> 40:04.221
Are you threatening me?

40:04.222 --> 40:06.421
Offering you a solution, love.

40:06.422 --> 40:09.820
One word in this kid's ear
and he'll keep his trap shut.

40:09.821 --> 40:13.060
I'll make sure the teachers come
back, the world keeps turning,

40:13.061 --> 40:17.062
and you can wheel on in next week,
full inspection, proper this time.

40:19.342 --> 40:21.300
You've no justification for this.

40:21.301 --> 40:23.380
I am here to make sure
the school runs properly.

40:23.381 --> 40:27.382
Believe me, I give more of a shite
about this place than anyone else.

40:27.782 --> 40:29.781
You have my word on that.

40:29.782 --> 40:33.782
Your word?!
I don't even know what you are!

40:34.422 --> 40:38.422
I'm Mrs Tutton. Head of the PTA.

40:51.622 --> 40:55.622
OK. That got my attention.

40:56.182 --> 40:59.501
Now go away
and ask about the Maguire family.

40:59.502 --> 41:03.502
Look 'em up online.
Have a read, have a think.

41:04.702 --> 41:08.702
Could always use someone like you.
When you get out.

41:09.742 --> 41:11.742
Because the way you're going now,

41:11.743 --> 41:15.742
it's Borstal, then Strangeways,
then a life pissed away!

41:18.902 --> 41:22.902
And I'd hate to see that happen.

41:30.742 --> 41:32.500
You can take those glasses off now.

41:32.501 --> 41:34.662
Oh, I like them,
makes me look intellectual,

41:34.663 --> 41:36.901
even more intellectual.

41:36.902 --> 41:40.902
We can nip away every so often.
Be someone else, like we were today.

41:41.182 --> 41:43.541
So we'd lie about who we are...

41:43.542 --> 41:47.542
"Lie" is a bit strong. It's more
like... we'd have secret identities.

41:50.742 --> 41:54.381
Don't you think
if we have to work that hard to try

41:54.382 --> 41:57.380
and hide something,
well then there's a bigger

41:57.381 --> 41:59.222
problem at the heart of it all?

41:59.223 --> 42:03.222
Let he who is without sin cast
the first stone.

42:10.182 --> 42:12.301
I'll give you that, Dom,

42:12.302 --> 42:16.302
you always manage to find faith
somewhere.

42:25.622 --> 42:29.622
Come on.

42:31.222 --> 42:33.781
This was

42:33.782 --> 42:36.101
a fucking disaster...

42:36.102 --> 42:39.620
Oh, come on, Russell. You've got
another shot at the inspection.

42:39.621 --> 42:43.622
Adam Wiggins is out your hair, and
all the teachers are back on Monday.

42:49.742 --> 42:53.742
I believe there's something
you want to say to me.

42:58.462 --> 43:02.462
Thank you, Mrs Tutton.

43:12.622 --> 43:15.622
'Maybe the thing about our secret
identities is that they might

43:15.623 --> 43:17.821
'be hidden to ourselves.'

43:17.822 --> 43:20.941
Oh - you remind me of that fella.

43:20.942 --> 43:22.661
Who's that? James Bond?

43:22.662 --> 43:24.061
No, the other one.

43:24.062 --> 43:25.622
Simon Templar. The Saint?

43:25.623 --> 43:29.622
Hurricane Higgins.

43:31.342 --> 43:35.342
'Like the man who discovered the
simple joys of a hard day's work.'

43:40.902 --> 43:42.741
On the house.

43:42.742 --> 43:44.341
Oh, cheers.

43:44.342 --> 43:47.620
Eh, you did good today, kid.
They'll be calling this place

43:47.621 --> 43:49.022
St Mimi's before too long.

43:49.023 --> 43:50.382
Shut up.

43:56.342 --> 44:00.342
Just do half this time, eh?

44:00.502 --> 44:01.982
'Or the woman who found her place

44:01.983 --> 44:05.061
'a million miles from where
she expected it.

44:05.062 --> 44:07.340
'That's a million miles
metaphorically.

44:07.341 --> 44:09.862
'Obviously. Not like she went
to outer space. Y'know,

44:09.863 --> 44:11.341
'Mars or something.

44:11.342 --> 44:14.180
'Or the boy who grew up
and found a brother that he had

44:14.181 --> 44:16.502
'more in common with that he'd
ever have realised.'

44:16.503 --> 44:18.782
There's room for one more, mate.

44:22.862 --> 44:26.862
Cheers, mate. Nice to meet you.

44:31.622 --> 44:35.622
'And the man who found love,
found a purpose in life.'

44:38.422 --> 44:41.060
'Had searched for God

'but found it in her crooked smile,

her face...'

44:52.702 --> 44:56.702
'But didn't realise that wasn't
who he was at all.'

44:59.102 --> 45:01.181
Are you waiting for someone?

'He was just a man,
waiting for the girl he loved...'

45:04.103 --> 45:05.581
No.

'..Who was never going to show.'

this was for the best.

You keep the takings
in a railway locker?

45:22.574 --> 45:23.973
Very secure, them lockers.

45:23.974 --> 45:27.333
She reckons there's upwards of three
grand in there. She never counts it.

45:27.334 --> 45:30.053
Problem with a teacher letting
the side down.

45:30.054 --> 45:32.453
The headmaster has personally asked
me to sort her out.

45:32.454 --> 45:34.973
Stick with me - I'll make
a new woman of you.

45:34.974 --> 45:37.173
Twelve grand.
And that's just this lot.

45:37.174 --> 45:39.733
All she's expecting is
a couple of stags.

45:39.734 --> 45:42.253
Me and Kelly, come into a bit
of money - ripped it off!

45:42.254 --> 45:44.094
- You want to launder some money?
- Shhh!

45:44.095 --> 45:45.597
Are you robbing us?
