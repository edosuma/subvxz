01:09.720 --> 01:13.723
<i>from the French aircraft carrier Foch
somewhere in the Mediterranean.</i>

01:14.141 --> 01:16.642
<i>Six days ago,
as the rebellion in Chechnya</i>

01:16.685 --> 01:19.145
<i>spread to
the neighbouring Caucasus republics,</i>

01:19.187 --> 01:21.522
<i>the Russian president
ordered massive bombing strikes</i>

01:21.607 --> 01:25.651
<i>against rebel positions
around Rutul and Belokany.</i>

01:26.612 --> 01:30.364
<i>Appalled at the loss of human life,
the President of the United States</i>

01:30.449 --> 01:33.326
<i>joined by the French president
and the British prime minister</i>

01:33.368 --> 01:35.953
<i>suspended all foreign aid to Russia.</i>

01:35.996 --> 01:38.998
<i>Ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Radchenko</i>

01:39.082 --> 01:42.251
<i>denounced the US pressure
as an act of war</i>

01:42.336 --> 01:45.379
<i>against the Russian Republic
and Russian sovereignty.</i>

01:45.464 --> 01:48.299
<i>Denouncing his own president
as a US puppet</i>

01:48.342 --> 01:51.844
<i>he called on the Russian people
to join him in revolt.</i>

01:53.013 --> 01:56.682
<i>He said, "This brutish
and hypocritical American intervention</i>

01:56.767 --> 01:58.517
<i>"will not go unanswered."</i>

01:58.560 --> 02:01.437
<i>On Tuesday, at 10:00
in the morning Moscow time</i>

02:01.521 --> 02:03.564
<i>the Russian parliament
was suspended</i>

02:03.649 --> 02:05.483
<i>and martial law was declared.</i>

02:05.525 --> 02:08.526
<i>With the government in crisis,
the Russian Republic</i>

02:08.612 --> 02:12.865
<i>was entering into what can only
be described as a state of civil war.</i>

02:13.200 --> 02:16.452
<i>Then yesterday at dawn,
Radchenko and rebel forces</i>

02:16.536 --> 02:20.206
<i>seized the region around Vladivostok,
including a naval base</i>

02:20.248 --> 02:23.459
<i>and a nuclear missile base
housing Russian ICBMs.</i>

02:24.211 --> 02:28.923
<i>As regular Russian military forces
move in to encircle Radchenko</i>

02:29.007 --> 02:32.718
<i>allied military forces
are in a state of high alert.</i>

02:32.761 --> 02:35.429
<i>These French planes
taking off behind me</i>

02:35.514 --> 02:37.223
<i>have been deployed
near the Caucasus</i>

02:37.265 --> 02:39.016
<i>since the beginning of the crisis</i>

02:39.059 --> 02:41.519
<i>and a crisis which started
in the Caucasus</i>

02:41.561 --> 02:43.729
<i>has now spread to the Far East</i>

02:43.814 --> 02:46.524
<i>and appears to be turning into
the worst standoff</i>

02:46.566 --> 02:48.901
<i>since the Cuban missile crisis.</i>

02:49.486 --> 02:52.613
<i>This is Richard Valeriani
reporting live for CNN</i>

02:52.698 --> 02:56.951
<i>from the French aircraft carrier Foch
somewhere in the Mediterranean.</i>

03:02.582 --> 03:04.917
Abracadabra!

03:04.960 --> 03:09.171
- I can't hear

03:12.426 --> 03:16.012
I need a volunteer from the audience.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.639
- Me! Me!
- Me, me, me!

03:18.724 --> 03:21.434
A brave volunteer.

03:21.518 --> 03:23.602
Me! Me! Me!

03:23.645 --> 03:25.312
Preferably...

03:25.397 --> 03:27.606
Preferably somebody who was born

03:27.649 --> 03:32.778
on October 18, 1990.

03:32.863 --> 03:35.448
That's you, honey. That's you.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.284
Over here? Over here?

03:39.286 --> 03:41.620
You must be the birthday girl.

03:41.663 --> 03:43.456
- What's your name?
- Robin.

03:43.957 --> 03:47.376
<i>Russian ultranationalist leader,
backed by his rebel army</i>

03:47.461 --> 03:51.297
<i>threatened nuclear attack
on the United States and Japan.</i>

03:51.381 --> 03:54.925
<i>The threats come as a response to the
US involvement in Chechnya</i>

03:54.968 --> 03:57.386
<i>and are not considered idle.</i>

03:57.846 --> 03:59.597
Now sit on the board.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.183
And tell me, Robin,
do you believe in magic?

04:02.267 --> 04:04.560
- Where'd he go?
- Good. Because if you believe...

04:04.644 --> 04:06.187
- I'll get him.
...we can suspend you in the air...

04:06.271 --> 04:08.564
- Be right back.
...without the help of a flying carpet.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.149
<i>Meeting in an emergency session...</i>

04:10.233 --> 04:11.817
You'll miss your daughter's levitation.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.779
<i>... while the President is sequestered
with his joint chiefs of staff.</i>

04:19.159 --> 04:22.244
<i>That footage was taken yesterday,
but half an hour ago</i>

04:22.329 --> 04:25.706
<i>surrounded by hostile forces,
rebel leader Vladimir Radchenko...</i>

04:25.791 --> 04:27.666
Maybe it's not as bad as it looks.

04:27.709 --> 04:30.294
<i>... threatened to use nuclear arms
on the United States and Japan</i>

04:30.337 --> 04:32.421
<i>should anyone,
including the Russian Army,</i>

04:32.506 --> 04:34.507
<i>attempt to move in on him.</i>

04:37.844 --> 04:41.722
<i>Based on the history of this man
this can't be viewed as an idle threat.</i>

04:41.807 --> 04:44.433
<i>- Sander Vanocur standing by...
- It is.</i>

04:54.069 --> 04:55.736
Commander Hunter.

05:20.846 --> 05:22.179
Annapolis.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.765
Five patrols on fast attacks.

05:24.850 --> 05:28.352
Two on boomers, one as X.O.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.524
A year at...

05:35.277 --> 05:37.069
Excuse me. Harvard?

05:42.659 --> 05:46.745
I talked to your former C.O.
He tells me he tried to adopt you.

05:49.499 --> 05:53.043
As you no doubt heard,
my X.O. has appendicitis.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.963
He's the best I ever had.

05:56.131 --> 05:58.591
I need a good man to fill his spot.

05:58.675 --> 06:01.302
Your name was at the top of the list.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.929
Well, that's good to know, sir.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.515
It was a short list.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.980
Your interests, Mr Hunter.
What do you like to do? Do you...

06:13.064 --> 06:17.151
Do you paint, play ball, play
an instrument, ride motorcycles, what?

06:17.235 --> 06:19.361
- I ride horses.
- Horses.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.448
What's the best horse you ever rode?

06:22.532 --> 06:26.160
- Arabian, sir.
- An Arabian? That's a powerful animal.

06:26.244 --> 06:27.328
Yes.

06:28.580 --> 06:32.041
- You ever ridden one?
- Me? Are you kidding?

06:32.125 --> 06:35.836
I couldn't handle an Arabian.
Just give me an old paint.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.593
Yeah, horses are fascinating animals.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.429
Dumb as fence posts but very intuitive.

06:45.472 --> 06:48.390
In that way, they're not too different
from high school girls.

06:48.475 --> 06:49.934
They might not have
a brain in their head

06:49.976 --> 06:53.103
but they do know
all the boys want to fuck 'em.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.983
Don't have to be able to read Ulysses
to know where they're comin' from.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.318
No, sir.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.951
He approves of you.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.121
Jack Russells. Smartest dogs alive.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.041
Name's Bear.
Goes everyplace with me.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.677
<i>Well, welcome aboard
the Alabama, son.</i>

07:24.761 --> 07:26.804
- Do me proud.
- I will, sir.

07:27.305 --> 07:29.848
- Congratulations, Mr Hunter.
- Thank you.

07:29.891 --> 07:33.185
<i>If one Russian citizen is killed</i>

07:34.354 --> 07:35.646
<i>and I am president</i>

07:35.689 --> 07:41.193
<i>then I will kill 900,000 of the people
who are responsible.</i>

07:41.528 --> 07:43.737
<i>- You'd use nuclear weapons?
- Yes, I would hit them...</i>

07:43.822 --> 07:46.282
<i>- Attention!
...with nuclear weapons.</i>

07:46.366 --> 07:48.742
<i>- At ease. Be seated.
- Sir, such talk is highly inflammatory.</i>

07:48.827 --> 07:52.413
<i>My dear young lady,
I do not engage in "talk."</i>

07:52.497 --> 07:56.792
<i>These are serious threats, which I
hope to be in the position to carry out.</i>

07:57.919 --> 08:00.170
I take it you've seen enough?

08:00.463 --> 08:04.675
Gentlemen, after a nice little vacation,
looks like we're back at it again.

08:04.718 --> 08:08.846
I hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.140
In the good old days of Cold War,
the Russians could always

08:11.224 --> 08:15.060
be depended on doing whatever is in
their own best interests.

08:15.145 --> 08:17.563
But this Radchenko's playing
a whole new ball game

08:17.647 --> 08:19.732
with a whole new set of rules.

08:19.774 --> 08:21.608
Now I've heard people talk

08:21.693 --> 08:24.862
but I don't think this man's talking
to get his picture in the paper.

08:24.904 --> 08:28.574
He seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.

08:28.616 --> 08:31.618
Always a dangerous combination.
And I think he's capable

08:31.703 --> 08:34.996
of doing every damn thing
he says he's going to do.

08:35.123 --> 08:39.418
That's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.

08:40.086 --> 08:43.172
So ends theory.
Thus, let us begin the facts.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.632
We've been informed by the NSA

08:45.717 --> 08:48.927
that an entire rebel corps
of the Russian Army is involved.

08:48.970 --> 08:52.264
That's four armoured divisions
numbering 60,000 men.

08:52.307 --> 08:54.141
There seems to be massive defections.

08:54.225 --> 08:56.685
Vladimir seems to be winning
the hearts and minds

08:56.770 --> 08:58.395
of the Russian soldiers.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.273
- Admiral.
- Thank you.

09:07.489 --> 09:11.575
They've seized the region by
the Chinese and North Korean borders.

09:11.868 --> 09:13.619
That includes a submarine base

09:13.661 --> 09:16.997
from which they've surged
four Akula-class attack subs.

09:17.082 --> 09:20.626
They have acquired
a nuclear base at Artem

09:20.710 --> 09:25.130
that houses 25 hardened silos
for Russian ICBMs

09:25.215 --> 09:27.966
armed with up to 10 warheads apiece.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.012
Now the Russian government has
assured us that talks are underway.

09:32.097 --> 09:36.517
They claim that Radchenko forces
do not possess the launch codes.

09:36.684 --> 09:39.019
But if Radchenko were to crack them

09:39.104 --> 09:41.480
they could launch against
our west coast direct

09:41.523 --> 09:44.817
or come in over the Pole,
take out Washington and New York.

09:46.027 --> 09:49.696
The Commander-in-Chief
has directed US military forces

09:49.781 --> 09:52.741
to set DEFCON four.

09:53.284 --> 09:55.744
We've been ordered
to get underway at 0600 hours

09:55.829 --> 10:00.416
to assume alert coverage, mid-Pacific,
the Far Eastern TVD target package.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.917
Please keep your men informed.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.670
Lieutenant Commander Hunter
is our new X.O.

10:04.754 --> 10:08.382
Please bring him up to speed
on ship's personnel and supplies.

10:08.466 --> 10:10.092
- Admiral?
- No, that's it.

10:10.385 --> 10:11.885
On your feet.

10:21.563 --> 10:23.814
- Here we go again, Commander.
- Thank you.

10:23.857 --> 10:24.940
You bet.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.568
Hey, Bobby. This is Bobby Dougherty.
He's Supplies.

10:27.652 --> 10:29.987
- Pleasure, Dougherty.
- Billy Linkletter, TSO.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.780
- Mr Linkletter.
- Commander.

10:31.865 --> 10:32.948
And you know Darik.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.701
- Yes. Westergaurd. Long time no see.
- How's Julia?

10:35.743 --> 10:37.035
- She's excellent.
- Good.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.955
- And Roy Zimmer, Communications.
- Welcome aboard.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.081
Thank you.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.292
<i>We served together
on the Baton Rouge.</i>

10:43.376 --> 10:48.464
- Twice.
- That's right. We're lucky to have him.

10:49.299 --> 10:51.633
I think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.

10:51.718 --> 10:54.052
He's crazy about that dog.
Takes him everywhere.

10:54.095 --> 10:55.637
The Navy looks the other way
'cause he's Ramsey.

10:55.722 --> 10:56.763
Navy looks the other way

10:56.848 --> 10:59.516
'cause he's one of the few skippers left
who've seen combat.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.895
- He took SEALS into Panama in '89.
- Tomahawks in the Gulf in '91.

11:02.979 --> 11:05.772
- Took out eight or nine X.O.S in '94?
- Ouch.

11:05.857 --> 11:09.026
- Last one caught what? Appendicitis?
- Yeah, right.

11:15.825 --> 11:18.911
<i>- The Enemy Below.
- Robert Mitchum.</i>

11:18.995 --> 11:21.038
- And?
- And what?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.248
- Robert Mitchum.
- Incomplete answer.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.084
- The German guy with the white hair?
- Yeah. What's his name?

11:26.127 --> 11:28.170
- Who was it?
- Curd Jürgens.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.267
Hardy Krüger.

11:43.019 --> 11:44.102
No way.

11:44.521 --> 11:46.813
Robert Shaw in his Nazi period.

11:46.898 --> 11:49.233
Question is invalid. We're even.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.278
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

11:53.363 --> 11:55.948
Good. Address me as "sir"
when you speak to me!

11:55.990 --> 11:58.116
Stand at attention, sailor!

11:59.244 --> 12:01.370
Is he gonna fit in the sub?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.247
Doubtful.

12:03.831 --> 12:05.082
Who played
the German sub commander

12:05.124 --> 12:06.625
<i>in The Enemy Below
with Robert Mitchum?</i>

12:06.709 --> 12:09.628
- Was it Curd Jürgens or Hardy Krüger?
- Sir...

12:09.712 --> 12:12.839
Wrong answer!
Drop down and give me 20! Now!

12:12.924 --> 12:17.010
- Move! Move!
- One. Two.

12:17.262 --> 12:20.264
<i>- Run Silent, Run Deep.
- Three.</i>

12:20.306 --> 12:22.891
The guy with the ears
and a little moustache.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.309
Cary Grant.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.273
I'm worried about T.

12:33.278 --> 12:35.862
- Why?
- She doesn't know what's goin' on.

12:35.947 --> 12:38.782
I think she thinks
I'm goin' away forever.

12:40.076 --> 12:42.995
- I'll take care of her.
- You will?

12:43.413 --> 12:44.663
- Yeah.
- You promise?

12:44.706 --> 12:45.831
I promise.

12:49.043 --> 12:51.503
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.509
Okay.

13:01.139 --> 13:02.848
You know I don't know what to say.

13:02.932 --> 13:04.641
Just say good-bye.

13:13.276 --> 13:15.068
See you in my dreams.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.571
Give me a kiss.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.094
- Davis.
- How you doin', sir?

14:05.161 --> 14:07.746
Crew present and accounted for, sir.

14:09.624 --> 14:11.124
Little ducks,

14:12.669 --> 14:14.753
there's trouble in Russia.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.589
So they called us.

14:19.384 --> 14:22.928
We're going over there and bringing

14:22.970 --> 14:25.931
the most lethal killing machine
ever devised.

14:26.849 --> 14:31.019
We're capable
of launching more firepower

14:31.729 --> 14:34.940
than has ever been released
in the history of war.

14:36.901 --> 14:38.777
For one purpose alone,

14:40.655 --> 14:42.656
to keep our country safe.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.786
We constitute the front line

14:48.162 --> 14:50.914
and the last line of defence.

14:55.628 --> 15:00.424
I expect and demand your very best.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.638
Anything less,
you should have joined the Air Force.

15:11.394 --> 15:14.688
This might be
our Commander-in-Chief's Navy,

15:15.231 --> 15:17.023
but this is my boat.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.527
And all I ask is that
you keep up with me.

15:20.945 --> 15:23.739
And if you can't

15:23.823 --> 15:27.617
that strange sensation you'll be feeling
in the seat of your pants

15:27.660 --> 15:29.202
will be my boot in your ass.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.014
- Mr Cob?
- Yes, sir!

15:49.974 --> 15:52.184
You're aware of the name of this ship,
aren't you, Mr Cob?

15:52.226 --> 15:54.186
Very aware, sir!

15:54.228 --> 15:56.480
It bears a proud name,
doesn't it, Mr Cob?

15:56.522 --> 15:58.273
Very proud, sir!

15:58.357 --> 16:02.027
- It represents fine people.
- Very fine people, sir!

16:02.111 --> 16:05.989
- Who live in a fine, outstanding state.
- Outstanding, sir!

16:06.032 --> 16:08.575
In the greatest country
in the entire world.

16:08.659 --> 16:11.203
In the entire world, sir.

16:11.287 --> 16:14.998
<i>- And what is that name, Mr Cob?
- Alabama, sir!</i>

16:15.041 --> 16:16.416
And what do we say?

16:16.501 --> 16:17.876
- Go, 'Bama!
- Go, 'Bama!

16:17.919 --> 16:19.795
- Roll tide!
- Roll tide!

16:19.879 --> 16:22.464
Chief of the Boat, dismiss the crew.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.549
Dismiss the crew. Aye-aye, sir.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.970
Crew! Department heads!
Attend to your departments!

16:29.764 --> 16:31.181
Fall out!

17:00.002 --> 17:03.797
Here. Part of your qualification
for command.

17:08.886 --> 17:12.472
The last breath of polluted air
for the next 65 days.

17:13.182 --> 17:14.766
Gonna miss it.

17:14.851 --> 17:17.102
I don't trust air I can't see.

17:27.738 --> 17:29.781
This is my favourite part.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.492
Right here, right now.

17:44.714 --> 17:46.214
Bravo, Hunter.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.216
Sir?

17:49.969 --> 17:52.637
You knew to shut up
and enjoy the view.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.390
Most eggheads want to talk it away.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.311
Your stock just went up
a couple of points.

17:59.604 --> 18:01.146
Thank you, sir.

18:01.272 --> 18:04.065
Allow me to give you
a tiny bit of advice.

18:04.525 --> 18:06.484
If you want your own boat someday

18:06.569 --> 18:08.445
the very worst thing you can do

18:08.487 --> 18:11.281
is worry about yourself
or try to impress me.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.826
I can't stand save-asses,
and I won't abide kiss-asses.

18:15.328 --> 18:19.164
You keep your priorities straight:
Your mission and your men.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.003
How you like that cigar?

18:27.298 --> 18:29.215
- It's good, sir.
- It's your first.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.383
Yeah.

18:32.511 --> 18:36.181
Don't like it too much.
They're more expensive than drugs.

18:37.058 --> 18:38.767
X.O., take her down.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.186
Take her down. Aye, sir.

18:42.063 --> 18:44.648
Control, Bridge, sounding.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.317
<i>Bridge, Control,
sounding 130 fathoms.</i>

18:53.950 --> 18:57.035
- Lookouts, clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge. Aye, sir.

18:57.119 --> 18:59.120
Officer of the deck, prepare to dive.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.915
- Captain down.
- Captain is down.

19:06.921 --> 19:09.172
- X.O. down.
- X.O. is down.

19:23.479 --> 19:25.897
- Submerge the ship.
- Diving Officer, submerge the ship.

19:25.982 --> 19:29.567
- Make your depth 150 feet.
- Make my depth 150 feet. Aye, sir.

19:29.652 --> 19:33.488
Chief of the watch,
on the 1 MC, dive, dive!

19:51.716 --> 19:53.883
Make your depth 150 feet.

19:54.218 --> 19:56.219
Five degree down bubble.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.848
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

20:41.932 --> 20:44.976
Radchenko is a fanatic, okay?
He's a potential Hitler.

20:45.019 --> 20:48.605
- Somebody should just shoot him.
- I have no problem with that.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.899
- Good.
- Well, it's fanatics who make history.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.359
- Colonel Patton was a fanatic.
- That's what made him great.

20:53.444 --> 20:55.737
You think this guy is Patton?

20:55.821 --> 20:58.990
He's a dangerous lunatic, threatening
nuclear war, and he means it.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.075
What's that make us,

21:00.159 --> 21:02.410
since we're the only nation
to ever drop a nuclear bomb?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.162
It makes us a prime target.

21:04.205 --> 21:06.206
There's a half a dozen
other Third World countries

21:06.290 --> 21:07.999
with atom bombs
who'd love to drop one on us.

21:08.042 --> 21:09.876
That's right. That's why
we should drop one on them.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.044
Are you a communist?

21:11.128 --> 21:13.880
You have a problem with us dropping
nuclear bombs on Japan?

21:13.964 --> 21:15.673
Shut up, Dougherty.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.927
You think it was a mistake, Mr Hunter?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.053
Sir?

21:20.137 --> 21:22.847
Using the bomb
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

21:25.851 --> 21:29.020
Well, if I thought that, sir,
I wouldn't be here.

21:30.189 --> 21:33.525
- Interesting way you put that.
- How'd I put it, sir?

21:35.027 --> 21:36.611
Very carefully.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.201
You do quality your remarks.

21:43.244 --> 21:45.370
Somebody asked me if we
should have bombed Japan,

21:45.412 --> 21:49.666
a simple, "Yes, by all means, sir.
Drop that fucker. Twice."

21:51.210 --> 21:54.712
I don't mean to suggest
that you're indecisive, Mr Hunter.

21:54.797 --> 21:56.214
Not at all.

21:56.799 --> 22:00.009
Just complicated.

22:02.638 --> 22:05.598
Of course, that's the way
the Navy wants you.

22:06.851 --> 22:08.852
Me, they wanted simple.

22:09.728 --> 22:12.355
Well, you certainly fooled them, sir.

22:13.858 --> 22:15.775
Be careful there, Mr Hunter.

22:15.860 --> 22:19.779
It's all I got to rely on,
bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.032
Rickhover gave me my command,

22:23.075 --> 22:25.910
a checklist, a target
and a button to push.

22:26.328 --> 22:28.079
All I had to know is how to push it.

22:28.122 --> 22:32.208
They'd tell me when.
They seem to want you to know why.

22:33.085 --> 22:36.296
I would hope they'd want us all
to know why, sir.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.884
At the Naval War College,

22:40.926 --> 22:45.096
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,
not 19th-century philosophy.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.892
"War is a continuation of politics
by other means."

22:49.602 --> 22:51.144
Von Clausewitz.

22:53.063 --> 22:56.357
I think, sir, that what he was actually
trying to say was a little more...

22:56.442 --> 22:57.859
Complicated?

23:03.824 --> 23:06.951
Yes, the purpose of war is
to serve a political end,

23:06.994 --> 23:09.287
but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.

23:10.039 --> 23:11.789
I'm very impressed.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.293
In other words, the sailor
most likely to win the war

23:15.336 --> 23:17.962
is the one most willing to part
company with the politicians

23:18.047 --> 23:20.340
and ignore everything except
the destruction of the enemy.

23:20.424 --> 23:22.300
You'd agree with that.

23:23.636 --> 23:28.181
I'd agree that that's what Clausewitz
was trying to say.

23:29.391 --> 23:30.642
But you wouldn't agree with it?

23:30.684 --> 23:32.310
No, sir, I do not.

23:32.394 --> 23:35.271
No, I just think that in the nuclear world

23:37.316 --> 23:39.817
the true enemy can't be destroyed.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.658
Attention on deck.

23:46.742 --> 23:50.620
Von Clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.

23:51.872 --> 23:52.997
Von?

23:59.546 --> 24:03.216
In my humble opinion,
in the nuclear world

24:03.300 --> 24:05.510
the true enemy is war itself.

24:17.731 --> 24:20.858
<i>Everywhere I go your face I see</i>

24:20.901 --> 24:23.111
<i>Every step I take</i>

24:23.195 --> 24:25.530
<i>You take with me</i>

24:25.572 --> 24:29.033
<i>Nowhere to run to, baby</i>

24:29.368 --> 24:31.327
<i>Nowhere to hide</i>

24:32.788 --> 24:36.374
<i>Got nowhere to run, baby</i>

24:36.792 --> 24:38.710
<i>Nowhere to hide</i>

24:40.087 --> 24:43.006
<i>I know you're no good for me</i>

24:43.507 --> 24:47.635
<i>But free of you I'll never be, baby</i>

24:59.606 --> 25:00.732
Move!

25:13.579 --> 25:17.123
Fire in the galley! Chief of the watch,
sound the general alarm!

25:40.773 --> 25:43.524
<i>Forward damage control, bring
additional fire extinguishers to the...</i>

25:45.527 --> 25:46.944
Fire's out of control. He's hurtin'.

25:46.987 --> 25:49.989
- You hit the kill switch?
- Couldn't get to it. Too hot.

26:10.511 --> 26:13.304
<i>Attention, all hands.
Fire has been contained.</i>

26:13.389 --> 26:17.058
<i>Damage control party,
assess damage and report to Control.</i>

26:17.393 --> 26:19.310
Initiate weapons system readiness test.

26:19.395 --> 26:20.645
Aye, sir.

26:25.067 --> 26:28.277
All right, station a reflash watch.
This thing could flare back up again.

26:36.703 --> 26:40.331
Conn, Radio, we are receiving flash
traffic emergency action message.

26:40.374 --> 26:43.126
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.

26:43.168 --> 26:47.088
<i>Alert one. Man battle stations missile
for weapons systems readiness test.</i>

26:47.172 --> 26:48.172
<i>Spin up all missiles.</i>

26:48.215 --> 26:50.341
What the hell is he runnin'
a missile drill now for?

26:50.426 --> 26:51.843
- You're in charge.
- Aye, sir.

26:51.927 --> 26:54.846
<i>Man battle stations missiles
for weapons system readiness test.</i>

26:54.930 --> 26:57.723
<i>Spin up all missiles.
This is an exercise.</i>

26:59.184 --> 27:00.560
Captain's in Control.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.236
I agree.
The message is properly formatted.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.114
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message

27:13.198 --> 27:15.116
for weapons system readiness test, sir.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.326
<i>- I concur, sir.
- Where's the X.O.?</i>

27:20.539 --> 27:22.999
<i>- Sir.
- Good of you to make it, Mr Hunter.</i>

27:23.584 --> 27:25.460
<i>Get the authenticator.</i>

27:25.669 --> 27:27.545
Get the authenticator.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.350
Let's go.

27:47.483 --> 27:49.275
Sir, request permission to authenticate.

27:49.359 --> 27:51.736
Permission granted. Authenticate.

27:55.324 --> 27:59.785
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo,
Echo, Charlie, Zulu, Tango."

27:59.870 --> 28:04.415
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo, Echo,
Charlie, Zulu, Tango."

28:04.708 --> 28:06.959
- Captain, message is authentic.
- I concur, sir.

28:07.044 --> 28:09.670
- I agree.
- Message is authentic.

28:10.172 --> 28:12.507
Sir, your captain's missile key.

28:19.097 --> 28:23.309
Set condition 1 SQ for WSRT.
This is the captain. This is an exercise.

28:23.393 --> 28:27.438
Set condition 1 SQ for WSRT.
This is the X.O. This is an exercise.

28:29.358 --> 28:31.400
Captain, that fire in the galley
could still flare...

28:31.443 --> 28:34.904
Now is not the time.
Make your depth 150 feet. All stop.

28:34.947 --> 28:38.032
Make my depth 150 feet. All stop.
Aye, sir.

28:38.116 --> 28:43.454
Weapons, Conn,
simulate pressurising, all tubes.

28:43.497 --> 28:45.456
<i>Conn, Weapons,
simulate pressurising, all missiles.</i>

28:45.499 --> 28:46.958
Aye-aye, sir.

28:47.042 --> 28:48.376
Simulate pressurising, all missiles.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.086
<i>Simulate pressurising, all missiles.
Aye.</i>

28:55.133 --> 28:57.260
All stations, proceed to 1 SQ.

28:57.302 --> 29:00.805
Ready all missiles for launch.
Come on, guys. Let's go!

29:01.515 --> 29:06.227
Weapons, Captain,
report approximate time for 1 SQ.

29:06.353 --> 29:10.773
Captain, Weapons, approximate time
to weapons system 1 SQ

29:10.816 --> 29:12.608
14 minutes, sir.

29:13.318 --> 29:16.320
Ship is at launch depth.
Ready to hover, sir.

29:16.363 --> 29:19.156
- Very well. Commence hovering.
- Commence hovering. Aye, sir.

29:19.199 --> 29:20.324
Control, Sick Bay,

29:20.409 --> 29:23.202
Chief Petty Officer Marichek
is undergoing cardiac arrest.

29:23.704 --> 29:27.832
<i>- We're beginning CPR.
- Chief of the watch, on the 1 MC.</i>

29:27.874 --> 29:29.667
<i>Gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?</i>

29:29.710 --> 29:32.837
<i>We've received word that a shipmate
is experiencing a medical problem.</i>

29:32.921 --> 29:34.672
<i>We're terminating the drill.</i>

29:34.756 --> 29:37.008
Mr Mahoney, take the conn.
I'm going below.

29:37.092 --> 29:39.677
- X.O.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

29:45.100 --> 29:49.020
Clear.

30:04.328 --> 30:05.953
It's okay, Chief.

30:07.706 --> 30:10.291
Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir.

30:35.984 --> 30:38.194
Hiya, boy. Hiya, hiya, hiya.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.405
How ya doin'? Oh, boy. Yeah.

30:43.992 --> 30:48.162
So, Mr Hunter, do you think
I was wrong to run that drill?

30:48.705 --> 30:49.955
Not necessarily, sir.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.084
- Do you think I got that man killed?
- No, sir.

30:53.168 --> 30:56.921
One thing had nothing to do
with the other. It was an accident.

30:57.255 --> 30:59.632
- Would you have run the drill?
- No, sir, I wouldn't have.

30:59.716 --> 31:00.925
Why not?

31:01.843 --> 31:03.511
The fire in the galley
could have flared back up.

31:03.595 --> 31:07.431
- I would have seen to it first, sir.
- I'm sure you would have.

31:07.766 --> 31:12.228
Me, on the other hand, I tend to think
that's the best time to run a drill.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.605
Confusion on the ship
is nothing to fear.

31:15.565 --> 31:17.942
It should be taken advantage of.

31:18.652 --> 31:22.780
Lest you forget, Mr Hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.

31:22.864 --> 31:25.449
You don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.620
What'd you think, son?
I was just some crazy old coot

31:29.705 --> 31:32.957
putting everyone in harm's way
as I yell "yee-haw"?

31:33.417 --> 31:35.960
That was not my first thought, sir.

31:36.461 --> 31:40.214
But there's no excuse. At the time
I was fighting the fire in the galley

31:40.298 --> 31:42.800
I did not agree with your call, sir.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.263
Take a seat.

31:58.108 --> 32:01.736
Just so we understand each other

32:01.820 --> 32:04.822
I don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.

32:04.865 --> 32:09.118
As I said to you before, I'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.

32:09.161 --> 32:12.329
When you got somethin' to say to me,
you say it in private.

32:12.414 --> 32:16.834
And if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.

32:18.545 --> 32:21.964
- Are we clear about that, Commander?
- As a bell, sir.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.675
Those sailors out there are just boys,

32:24.718 --> 32:27.511
boys who are training to do a terrible
and unthinkable thing,

32:27.554 --> 32:28.596
and if that ever occurs

32:28.680 --> 32:32.057
the only reassurance they'll have
that they're doing the proper thing

32:32.142 --> 32:35.519
is gonna derive from their unqualified
belief in the unified chain of command.

32:35.604 --> 32:39.857
That means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.777
It means
we don't undermine each other.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.737
It means in a missile drill

32:44.821 --> 32:48.491
they hear your voice right after mine,
without hesitation.

32:50.869 --> 32:54.455
- Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- Absolutely, sir.

32:55.874 --> 32:59.293
We're here to preserve democracy,
not to practise it.

33:02.714 --> 33:07.051
There'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.

33:07.135 --> 33:09.303
- Go see to it.
- Aye-aye, sir.

33:10.388 --> 33:11.806
Oh, Hunter.

33:12.641 --> 33:15.392
Short of the outbreak of World War III,

33:15.477 --> 33:19.063
the ship sinking or being
attacked by a giant octopus,

33:19.147 --> 33:21.690
I'd like to be undisturbed
for the next 30 minutes.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.567
I'll see to it, sir.

33:23.985 --> 33:27.571
By the way, it was Marichek's
300 pounds that killed him.

33:31.493 --> 33:32.952
Not the fire.

33:35.997 --> 33:37.081
Dismissed.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.975
One, two, three, four.

33:58.311 --> 34:00.604
Back. Back.

34:01.982 --> 34:03.983
One, two. One, two.

34:20.208 --> 34:22.251
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:23.628 --> 34:26.922
Does it make any sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?

34:26.965 --> 34:30.342
- Fire was out, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a man died, too.

34:30.844 --> 34:33.679
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- What?

34:34.639 --> 34:37.641
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- Weps...

34:39.936 --> 34:43.313
A fire is a serious threat to the ship.
Now where was he?

34:43.356 --> 34:45.815
- Why didn't he check it out first, huh?
- That's his style.

34:45.859 --> 34:47.943
- He's a hard-ass.
- So what?

34:48.320 --> 34:50.237
So you wanna fight him, go ahead.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.157
You wanna get along, you gotta get
to understand him a little bit.

34:53.241 --> 34:55.367
Two schools of thought here.

34:55.452 --> 34:57.828
To him, you're Annapolis, Harvard,

34:57.913 --> 35:00.998
expert on theory,
well-versed in world affeirs.

35:01.625 --> 35:04.835
He's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the last 25 years.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.921
He's probably
a little paranoid about that.

35:07.005 --> 35:09.798
I mean, Navy's all he's got.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.759
Navy and that little rat-dog of his.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.345
That's why his wife left him.

35:15.931 --> 35:17.848
So what are you saying?

35:18.058 --> 35:21.268
I'm just sayin' watch out.
Give him a little room.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.354
Let him get to know you.

35:25.065 --> 35:26.732
You do pants, too?

35:40.997 --> 35:43.290
Conn, Radio:
Receiving emergency action message.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.751
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one!

35:46.378 --> 35:50.339
<i>Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming emergency action message!</i>

35:50.382 --> 35:53.217
<i>Alert one! Alert one! Incoming EAM.</i>

35:54.719 --> 35:56.053
Captain.

36:08.650 --> 36:10.192
Captain has asked me to brief you

36:10.235 --> 36:13.404
on the emergency action message
we just received.

36:15.281 --> 36:17.908
As you know, before we got underway,

36:17.951 --> 36:22.079
the Russian army was in position
and circling the rebel camps,

36:22.163 --> 36:24.331
and Radchenko started making
extravagant threats

36:24.416 --> 36:26.750
should anyone move in on him

36:26.835 --> 36:28.711
that he would launch
his land-based nuclear weapons

36:28.753 --> 36:31.255
at the United States and at Japan.

36:32.340 --> 36:33.465
The only safeguard was

36:33.550 --> 36:37.094
that the Russian government
controlled the launch codes.

36:37.178 --> 36:40.556
Intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised.

36:41.850 --> 36:45.477
US military forces have been
directed to set DEFCON three.

36:45.854 --> 36:47.771
The last time we hit
this state of emergency

36:47.814 --> 36:51.567
was 32-and-a-half years ago
during the Cuban missile crisis.

36:52.610 --> 36:56.655
So this is what it's all about,
gentlemen. It's what we train for.

36:58.241 --> 36:59.450
Captain.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.787
The NCA has determined

37:03.872 --> 37:07.791
that should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled,

37:08.960 --> 37:12.796
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour,

37:12.881 --> 37:14.965
we'll be compelled to act.

37:17.677 --> 37:21.805
Now given our patrol sector
here in the Emperor Sea Mounts,

37:21.848 --> 37:25.601
it seems clear that our friends
in the Pentagon

37:25.643 --> 37:28.979
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.816
It's important to remain focused.

37:34.694 --> 37:36.653
Keep your men informed.

37:41.534 --> 37:43.077
Any questions?

37:46.122 --> 37:47.498
Dismissed.

37:55.757 --> 37:59.593
We lost that frying unit, and then
we can't get the same capacity in...

38:02.680 --> 38:04.014
Hey, man!

38:05.642 --> 38:08.727
I'm gonna fuck you up! Get out! Get...

38:08.812 --> 38:12.064
Get out of here, man! Get him out!
Motherfucker!

38:12.649 --> 38:15.567
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- Bennefield, you crazy, man?

38:19.364 --> 38:21.240
- Rivetti, what's up?
- I'm sorry, sir.

38:21.324 --> 38:23.158
It's just a difference of opinion
that got out of hand.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.618
What about?

38:24.702 --> 38:27.121
It's really too silly to talk about, sir.
I'd rather just forget about...

38:27.205 --> 38:28.831
I don't give a damn about
what you'd rather forget about.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.916
Why were you two fighting?

38:31.376 --> 38:34.711
I said that the Kirby Silver Surfer
was the only real Silver Surfer

38:34.796 --> 38:36.964
and that the Moebius Silver Surfer
was shit.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.633
And Bennefield's a big Moebius fan,
and...

38:39.717 --> 38:42.678
It just got out of hand.
I pushed him, he pushed me.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.723
- I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry.
- Rivetti, you're a supervisor.

38:46.766 --> 38:49.101
You can get a commission like that.

38:49.185 --> 38:51.728
I know it, sir. You're 100% right.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.481
- It'll never happen again.
- It better not happen again.

38:54.566 --> 38:57.568
I see this kind of nonsense, I'm gonna
write you up. You understand?

38:57.652 --> 38:58.861
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

38:58.903 --> 39:01.405
You have to set an example
even in the face of stupidity.

39:01.489 --> 39:02.906
Everybody that reads comic books

39:02.949 --> 39:05.659
knows that Kirby Silver Surfer
is the only true Silver Surfer.

39:05.743 --> 39:08.120
- Now am I right or wrong?
- You're right, sir.

39:08.204 --> 39:10.831
- All right. Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

39:23.553 --> 39:26.013
- Captain.
- How can I help you?

39:26.097 --> 39:28.640
Test results from the missile drill.

39:34.147 --> 39:36.148
This the best they can do?

39:36.232 --> 39:38.108
No, sir, but that's what they did.

39:38.193 --> 39:40.277
I want this down to five minutes.
Train on it.

39:40.361 --> 39:41.695
Yes, sir.

39:41.779 --> 39:45.616
Tell your buddy Weps
we're gonna do it again.

39:45.658 --> 39:48.702
We're gonna keep on doin' it
until he gets it right.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.078
Damn.

39:51.289 --> 39:54.499
Feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.044
Or a pat on the back, sir.

39:57.462 --> 40:01.173
I just witnessed a fight down in
crew's mess. No big deal,

40:01.257 --> 40:05.969
but I think the men are a little on edge
with all we're going through.

40:06.179 --> 40:08.388
Morale seems to be a bit low.

40:10.725 --> 40:14.811
Well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.

40:17.523 --> 40:19.107
Thank you, sir.

40:28.993 --> 40:30.953
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

40:32.872 --> 40:39.044
<i>Mr Hunter has informed me
that morale may be a bit low,</i>

40:41.005 --> 40:42.965
<i>that you may be a bit...</i>

40:44.384 --> 40:47.010
<i>- On edge.
- On edge.</i>

40:49.180 --> 40:51.515
<i>So I suggest this,</i>

40:51.557 --> 40:55.310
<i>any crew member who feels
he can't handle the situation</i>

40:55.353 --> 40:57.646
<i>can leave the ship right now.</i>

40:58.773 --> 41:01.692
<i>Gentlemen, we"re at DEFCON three.</i>

41:01.776 --> 41:03.402
<i>War is imminent.</i>

41:04.529 --> 41:06.280
<i>This is the captain.</i>

41:07.699 --> 41:09.116
<i>That is all.</i>

41:13.037 --> 41:14.830
Very inspiring, sir.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.960
Come on, Bear. Come on. Come on.

41:35.852 --> 41:37.686
Sup? Come here.

41:39.939 --> 41:41.481
You hear that?

41:43.776 --> 41:48.071
I've got a broadband contact
bearing 047.

41:48.281 --> 41:50.407
Assigning tracker sierra in ATF.

41:50.491 --> 41:54.745
Conn, Sonar, we have a possible
submerged submarine bearing 047.

41:54.829 --> 41:57.247
Designate contact, Master 28.

41:57.290 --> 41:59.416
Sonar, Conn, aye.
Man battle stations torpedo.

41:59.500 --> 42:02.711
- Rig for ultraquiet.
- Make tubes one and four fully ready.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.339
Make tubes one and four fully ready.
Aye, sir.

42:07.925 --> 42:09.885
<i>Man battle stations torpedo.</i>

42:14.974 --> 42:16.141
All right, what do you got?

42:16.225 --> 42:17.976
Sir, we have a possible
submerged submarine

42:18.061 --> 42:20.812
bearing 049, designate master 28.

42:21.814 --> 42:25.984
Best depth for evasion, sir,
is 831 feet to avoid that sub.

42:27.445 --> 42:29.071
Lieutenant Mahoney,
this is the captain.

42:29.113 --> 42:32.616
Increase your speed to standard.
Come left to course 270.

42:33.076 --> 42:36.411
Make your depth 831 feet, smartly.

42:38.748 --> 42:41.291
- You find out who that is.
- Aye, sir.

42:42.710 --> 42:44.586
Who are you, sweetheart?

42:44.629 --> 42:46.421
Helm, all ahead standard.

42:46.464 --> 42:49.299
Dive. Make your depth
831 feet, smartly.

42:49.384 --> 42:50.634
Aye, sir.

42:58.017 --> 43:00.102
Conn, Radio,
receiving emergency action message!

43:00.144 --> 43:02.187
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.

43:02.271 --> 43:03.647
Recommend alert one.

43:03.981 --> 43:07.067
<i>Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming emergency action message.</i>

43:15.827 --> 43:19.329
Captain, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message

43:19.372 --> 43:22.666
from National Command Authority

43:22.708 --> 43:25.419
- I concur, sir.
- Get the authenticator.

43:46.691 --> 43:49.651
Chief of the watch,

43:49.694 --> 43:52.821
Man battle stations missile

43:52.864 --> 43:54.948
Secure for battle stations torpedo.

43:55.032 --> 43:56.533
<i>Man battle stations missile...</i>

43:56.617 --> 43:58.410
Sir, request permission to authenticate.

44:22.894 --> 44:24.394
I concur, sir.

44:26.022 --> 44:27.814
Message is authentic.

44:28.065 --> 44:30.442
Sir, your captain's missile key.

44:40.077 --> 44:45.081
<i>This is the captain. Set condition 1 SQ
for strategic missile launch.</i>

44:45.208 --> 44:48.585
<i>Spin up missiles one through five
and 20 through 24.</i>

44:49.003 --> 44:52.297
<i>The release of nuclear weapons

44:54.383 --> 44:56.176
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

44:59.805 --> 45:03.808
X.O., take the conn. I'm going
to my stateroom for the launch keys.

45:03.893 --> 45:05.810
X.O. has the conn.

45:11.734 --> 45:14.861

<i>This is the X.O.</i>

45:24.747 --> 45:28.041
Conn, Weapons, estimated time
to 1 SQ for strategic launch

45:28.125 --> 45:29.834
is 14 minutes, sir.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.306
One, two, three, four, five, six.

45:43.808 --> 45:45.350
Go, sailor, go.

45:49.063 --> 45:52.857
<i>Set condition 1 SQ

45:53.442 --> 45:54.609
Comin' through!

<i>Spin up missiles one through five

46:09.959 --> 46:12.210
- I have the conn.
- The captain has the conn.

46:12.295 --> 46:14.337
Passing 550 feet.

46:21.262 --> 46:25.265
Conn, Radio, sir, we're out of VLF radio
range. Full message capacity is cut off.

46:25.349 --> 46:28.184
Radio, Conn, extend
extremely low frequency antenna.

46:28.227 --> 46:31.271
Passing 600 feet.
Coming to 831 feet, sir.

46:41.866 --> 46:44.534
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

46:44.702 --> 46:48.038
Conn, Sonar, sir,
we have his classification.

46:49.957 --> 46:52.959
Mark that tape.
Get the classification on your monitor.

46:53.044 --> 46:54.544
Rivetti, what the hell is going on?

46:54.629 --> 46:58.340
Sir, the master 28 is classified as
a Russian Akula-class hunter-killer.

46:58.591 --> 47:02.552
Bearing 196, sir! He's close,
but I don't think he's spotted us.

47:08.309 --> 47:10.268
- Stay on him!
- Aye, sir.

47:10.353 --> 47:13.396
- Captain has the conn.
- Passing 800 feet, sir.

47:14.607 --> 47:17.359
Continue to dive.
Give me five degree down bubble.

47:17.401 --> 47:20.278
- Continue rigging for ultraquiet.
- Aye, aye, sir.

47:20.363 --> 47:23.740
Five degree down bubble.
Rigging for ultraquiet, sir.

47:39.757 --> 47:42.050
<i>Gentlemen, this is the captain.</i>

47:42.093 --> 47:45.095
<i>We have an Akula-class submarine
out there.</i>

47:45.179 --> 47:47.514
<i>We know Radchenko controls
at least four submarines.</i>

47:47.598 --> 47:49.391
<i>This could be one of them.</i>

47:49.433 --> 47:53.353
<i>Russian rebels have threatened
to launch against our country</i>

47:53.437 --> 47:55.188
<i>and are fueling right now.</i>

47:55.272 --> 47:58.650
<i>They will have launch capability
in 60 minutes.</i>

47:59.151 --> 48:01.486
<i>We have orders
to launch our missiles,</i>

48:01.570 --> 48:03.905
<i>which is exactly
what we're going to do.</i>

48:03.948 --> 48:07.242
<i>We are rigging for ultraquiet.
All hands, be ready.</i>

48:08.077 --> 48:10.286
<i>This is as real as it gets.</i>

48:10.371 --> 48:13.707
<i>We'll presume nothing,
defend ourselves at all cost.</i>

48:14.458 --> 48:17.043
<i>If that sub even comes around
or opens up a tube door,</i>

48:17.128 --> 48:18.837
<i>we'll take her out.</i>

48:22.091 --> 48:23.717
Passing 900 feet.

48:31.767 --> 48:34.728
- He's gone.
- Like hell he is.

48:35.813 --> 48:37.355
He's up there.

48:37.481 --> 48:39.107
950.

48:39.191 --> 48:43.027
Conn, Weapons, missile systems
ready to launch in 11 minutes.

48:54.582 --> 48:58.501
Conn, Radio, receiving transmission on
extremely low frequency receiver, sir.

48:59.253 --> 49:02.130
Very well.
Mr Hunter, go to Radio, please.

49:05.217 --> 49:07.343
- Okay, pull up the code.
- What do you got?

49:07.386 --> 49:10.013
X.O., incoming EAM,
but we're too deep

49:10.097 --> 49:12.265
to receive
any radio communication, sir.

49:18.022 --> 49:20.023
<i>- Captain.
- X.O.</i>

49:20.107 --> 49:23.610
<i>We got a limited radio transmission
indicating an incoming EAM.</i>

49:23.694 --> 49:26.529
We need to go shallow
to reestablish communications.

49:26.572 --> 49:30.283
With that sub still up there?
Mr Hunter, it's my...

49:31.368 --> 49:33.828
<i>- Come up to conn, Mr Hunter.
- Yes, sir.</i>

49:35.331 --> 49:37.540
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble. Aye, sir.

49:37.583 --> 49:39.501
1,275 feet, sir.

49:46.425 --> 49:50.178
<i>Conn, Weapons, missile systems
ready to launch in 10 minutes.</i>

49:51.263 --> 49:53.306
<i>- Sir.
- Attention, all hands.</i>

49:53.390 --> 49:56.059
<i>- Ship has been rigged for ultraquiet.
- Captain?</i>

50:02.358 --> 50:06.194
When our missile system
is ready, Mr Hunter,

50:07.112 --> 50:10.949
it is my intention to rise to launch depth
launch our birds

50:11.033 --> 50:13.701
and then get the hell out of there.
Not until then.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.956
I can't jeopardise
the safety of this ship.

50:18.040 --> 50:19.374
Yes, sir.

50:20.918 --> 50:24.379
May I suggest that we float
the buoy, sir? We have enough cable.

50:24.421 --> 50:28.550
That should give us enough reach
to receive the EAM transmission.

50:28.592 --> 50:29.717
Sir.

50:31.387 --> 50:33.388
Very well. Float the buoy.

50:35.391 --> 50:37.183
Chief of the watch, float the buoy.

50:37.268 --> 50:39.602
Float the radio buoy. Aye, sir.

50:47.111 --> 50:50.572
Radio buoy deploying, sir.
Tension 2,000 pounds.

50:53.534 --> 50:54.909
Very well.

50:56.078 --> 51:00.123
Conn, Weapons, estimated time
to 1 SQ, 8 minutes, 30 seconds, sir.

51:07.131 --> 51:08.089
The winch!

51:09.258 --> 51:11.467
<i>Conn, Sonar, we have a sound short
from the buoy winch!</i>

51:11.552 --> 51:13.261
Stop the goddamn winch!

51:14.972 --> 51:16.889
Winch is stopped, sir!

51:18.767 --> 51:20.393
Goddamn it.

51:32.323 --> 51:34.073
TSO, is that sound still out there?

51:34.158 --> 51:37.076
Sonar, TSO,
is that sound still out there?

51:37.703 --> 51:39.412
Sound's gone, sir.

51:55.679 --> 51:57.555
I'm getting something.

52:03.604 --> 52:04.812
Sup, he's comin' around!

52:04.855 --> 52:07.857
Conn, Sonar,
the Akula's turning toward, sir!

52:10.027 --> 52:12.987
Conn, Sonar, torpedo in the water!
Bearing 241!

52:14.406 --> 52:17.533
Conn, Sonar, second torpedo
in the water! Bearing 242!

52:17.618 --> 52:19.410
All ahead flank! Right full rudder!

52:25.042 --> 52:27.669
Conn, Sonar,
3,000 yards and closing, sir!

52:27.711 --> 52:29.629
Manoeuvring, Conn, cavitate! Cavitate!

52:35.761 --> 52:38.429
- Sound the collision alarm!
- Sound collision alarm! Aye, sir!

52:38.514 --> 52:40.556
<i>- 2,500 yards.
- Rig ship for impact!</i>

52:40.641 --> 52:42.392
Hang onto your ass, gentlemen!

52:42.476 --> 52:43.726
<i>2,000 yards.</i>

52:46.980 --> 52:48.606
1,500 yards.

52:48.732 --> 52:53.736
<i>Bearing 070! 071! 1,200 yards!</i>

52:58.742 --> 53:00.827
1,000 yards and closing fast!

53:00.911 --> 53:03.079
Conn, Radio,
receiving emergency action message.

53:03.163 --> 53:05.540
Recommend alert one!

53:06.667 --> 53:08.418
<i>950 yards!</i>

53:09.586 --> 53:12.463
Launch a five-inch evasion device.
Launch the countermeasures.

53:16.593 --> 53:19.595
- Countermeasures away, sir.
- Shift your rudder to left full.

53:19.930 --> 53:21.931
<i>500 yards and closing fast.</i>

53:27.688 --> 53:29.772
<i>300 yards and closing, sir.</i>

53:40.200 --> 53:42.702
Sir, the first torpedo's going
after the countermeasures!

53:44.705 --> 53:46.456
They missed! They missed!

53:47.458 --> 53:50.126
Sonar, Conn, Conn, Sonar,
second torpedo incoming!

53:50.210 --> 53:51.335
<i>It's gonna be close!</i>

54:07.144 --> 54:10.688
<i>Conn, Sonar, the Akula's disappeared
in the thermal, sir.</i>

54:10.773 --> 54:13.232
All ahead standard!
Rudder amidships!

54:13.317 --> 54:15.193
All ahead standard.
Rudder amid ships. Aye.

54:15.277 --> 54:16.736
All stations.

54:17.321 --> 54:19.864
<i>All stations, report damage.
Report damage.</i>

54:19.948 --> 54:23.451
<i>Engine room reports
number one ASW pump failed.</i>

54:23.494 --> 54:25.703
<i>Control, Torpedo Room,
three feet of water in the bilge.</i>

54:25.788 --> 54:27.955
<i>Request a team
with a submersible pump.</i>

54:28.832 --> 54:31.125
<i>Control, Engine Room,

54:31.168 --> 54:33.669
<i>lay to the engine room

54:33.712 --> 54:36.506
Sonar, Conn, report hostile contact.

54:36.965 --> 54:40.510
<i>- Conn, Sonar, we lost him, sir.
- Well, keep looking.</i>

54:40.594 --> 54:43.346
<i>- He's out there looking for us.
- Aye, sir.</i>

54:43.388 --> 54:45.598
Weapons, Conn,
estimated time to 1 SQ.

54:45.682 --> 54:47.934
Conn, Weapons, missile systems
ready to launch

54:48.018 --> 54:50.019
<i>- in six minutes.
- Very well.</i>

54:50.062 --> 54:52.522
<i>Main seawater pump
is out of commission.</i>

54:52.606 --> 54:55.191
Mr Zimmer, where's that EAM?

54:56.026 --> 54:58.528
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.

55:00.864 --> 55:03.407
- That's it?
- It's incomplete, sir.

55:03.492 --> 55:05.618
We lost it when the radio buoy cable
got severed.

55:07.204 --> 55:08.246
All right.

55:17.714 --> 55:20.258
All right, gentlemen, let's get on with it.

55:20.342 --> 55:22.093
All ahead one-third.

55:23.512 --> 55:25.137
Steady as you go.

55:25.889 --> 55:28.558
All ahead one-third. Steady. Aye, sir.

55:28.851 --> 55:32.353
Make your depth 150 feet. Zero bubble.

55:32.396 --> 55:34.230
Up slow and silent to launch depth.

55:34.314 --> 55:37.066
Up slow and silent to launch depth.
Aye-aye, Captain.

55:40.362 --> 55:43.573
Captain? Got the EAM.

55:45.909 --> 55:48.786
- What do you think?
- I think there's nothing on this.

55:49.413 --> 55:52.373
Yes, sir. It got cut off during the attack.

55:52.416 --> 55:54.333
Then it's meaningless.

55:55.127 --> 55:57.420
Sir, this is an EAM
pertaining to nuclear missiles.

55:57.462 --> 56:00.298
No, Mr Hunter,
that's a message fragment.

56:01.049 --> 56:02.675
Because it got cut off
during the attack, sir.

56:02.759 --> 56:04.886
The message could mean anything.
It could be a message to abort.

56:04.928 --> 56:07.096
- It could be a message...
- Could be a fake Russian transmission.

56:07.180 --> 56:09.140
Which is exactly why
we need to confirm it, sir.

56:09.224 --> 56:11.267
All I'm asking for is the time we need
to get back on line.

56:11.310 --> 56:13.185
- Calm down, Mr Hunter.
- I am calm.

56:13.270 --> 56:14.520
You don't appear to be calm.

56:14.605 --> 56:18.274
<i>Conn, Weapons, missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.</i>

56:18.317 --> 56:20.276
- Step aside, seaman.
- Yes, sir.

56:25.616 --> 56:27.658
We have orders in hand,

56:27.743 --> 56:30.161
and those orders are
to make a preemptive launch.

56:30.245 --> 56:32.204
Every second that we lose
increases the chances

56:32.289 --> 56:35.041
that by the time our missiles arrive,
their silos could be empty,

56:35.125 --> 56:36.959
'cause they've flown their birds
and struck us first.

56:37.002 --> 56:38.502
- Yes, sir.
- You know as well as I do

56:38.587 --> 56:42.089
that any launch order received
without authentication is no order at all.

56:42.132 --> 56:43.841
- Captain, National...
- That's our number 1 rule.

56:43.926 --> 56:47.011
That rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time and time again.

56:47.095 --> 56:49.472
- Yes, sir.
- It's a rule we follow without exception.

56:49.514 --> 56:54.226
Captain, National Military Command
Centre knows what sector we're in.

56:54.311 --> 56:57.229
They have satellites looking down
on us to see if our birds are aloft.

56:57.314 --> 57:00.066
And if they're not, then they give
our orders to somebody else.

57:00.150 --> 57:02.818
That's why we maintain more than one
sub. It's what they call "redundancy."

57:02.861 --> 57:06.447
- I know about redundancy, Mr Hunter.
- All I'm saying...

57:14.748 --> 57:17.667
All I'm saying, Captain,
is that we have backup.

57:18.377 --> 57:21.837
Now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.

57:23.465 --> 57:27.009
You're presuming that we have other
submarines out there ready to launch.

57:27.094 --> 57:28.386
But as captain, I must assume

57:28.470 --> 57:32.014
that our submarines could have been
taken out by other Akulas.

57:32.057 --> 57:34.976
We can play these games all night,
Mr Hunter, but I don't have the luxury

57:35.018 --> 57:36.185
- of your presumptions.
- Sir...

57:36.228 --> 57:39.355
Mr Hunter, we have rules
that are not open to interpretation,

57:39.398 --> 57:42.775
personal intuition, gut feelings,
hairs on the back of your neck,

57:42.859 --> 57:44.819
little devils or angels
sitting on your shoulders.

57:44.861 --> 57:46.779
- Captain...
- We're all very well aware

57:46.863 --> 57:49.031
of what our orders are
and what those orders mean.

57:49.074 --> 57:50.992
They come down from
our Commander-in-Chief.

57:51.034 --> 57:52.326
They contain no ambiguity.

57:52.369 --> 57:54.787
- Captain, sir...
- Mr Hunter, I've made the decision.

57:54.871 --> 57:57.957
I'm captain of this boat.
Now shut the fuck up!

58:05.924 --> 58:07.049
Damn.

58:09.511 --> 58:10.928
Weapons, Conn,

58:11.013 --> 58:16.225
<i>shift targeting
to target package SLBM 64741/2.</i>

58:16.309 --> 58:18.060
This is the captain.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.568
- Captain, I cannot concur.
- Repeat my command.

58:25.610 --> 58:27.403
Sir, we don't know what this means.

58:27.487 --> 58:28.946
Our target package
could have changed.

58:29.031 --> 58:32.408
You repeat this order
or I'll find somebody who will!

58:33.577 --> 58:35.870
- Hell, no, you won't, sir.
- You're relieved of your position.

58:35.912 --> 58:38.372
Cob, remove Mr Hunter
from the control room.

58:38.415 --> 58:41.417
- Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here now!
- No, sir, I do not concur

58:41.460 --> 58:43.586
and I do not recognise your authority
to relieve me

58:43.628 --> 58:45.171
on the command
under Navy regulations.

58:45.255 --> 58:47.590
- Cob, arrest this man and get him out!
- Captain Ramsey,

58:47.632 --> 58:50.468
under operating procedures governing
the release of nuclear weapons

58:50.552 --> 58:53.554
we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and I agree!

58:53.597 --> 58:55.931
- Cob, what are you waiting for?
- Now this is more than formality, sir.

58:55.974 --> 58:59.351
This is why your command must
be repeated! It requires my assent!

58:59.436 --> 59:02.229
I do not give it, and, furthermore,
you continue upon this course

59:02.272 --> 59:04.648
and insist upon this launch
without confirming this message first...

59:04.733 --> 59:06.567
- Son of a bitch. Chief of the boat...
- I will be forced,

59:06.610 --> 59:07.693
backed by the rules of precedents...

59:07.778 --> 59:09.361
As captain and commanding officer
of the USS Alabama...

59:09.446 --> 59:10.821
...authority and command regulation
08150H6...

59:10.906 --> 59:13.365
I order you to place the X.O.
Under arrest on the charge of mutiny!

59:13.450 --> 59:15.659
...of the Navy regulations to relieve you
of command, Captain!

59:15.744 --> 59:18.120
I say again, I order you
to place the X.O. under arrest

59:18.205 --> 59:20.206
on the charge of mutiny!

59:21.541 --> 59:25.086
- Cob!
- Captain, please, the X.O. is right.

59:25.128 --> 59:27.630
We can't launch unless he concurs.

59:29.633 --> 59:31.425
"To the USS Alabama.

59:31.468 --> 59:33.469
"Rebel-controlled missiles

They're fueling their missiles!
We don't have time to fuck around!

59:44.815 --> 59:47.024
Sir, I think you need time
to think this over.

59:47.109 --> 59:49.485
I don't have to think this over!

59:51.655 --> 59:55.157
Captain, I relieve you
of your command of this ship.

59:55.200 --> 59:57.326
Cob, escort the captain
to his stateroom.

59:57.410 --> 59:59.328
- I'm assuming command.
- You're not assuming anything.

Aye, sir. Mitchell! Walker!

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:12.633
Take the captain below.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:42.705
You're way out of your league, Hunter.

01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:46.208
You're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.

01:01:00.682 --> 01:01:02.892
What the hell we waitin' for?

01:01:17.699 --> 01:01:20.576
Anybody here disagrees
with what I've done,

01:01:24.623 --> 01:01:27.917
then you feel free
to relieve yourself of duty now.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:34.673
Anybody?

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.477
All right.

01:01:53.193 --> 01:01:55.152

01:03:34.294 --> 01:03:35.794
Sir?

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:39.131
Thank you, Cob.

01:03:39.507 --> 01:03:42.509
"Thank you"? Fuck you.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:45.387
Get it straight, Mr Hunter.
I'm not on your side.

01:03:45.847 --> 01:03:47.973
Now you could be wrong.

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:50.893
But wrong or right, the captain can't
just replace you at will.

01:03:50.977 --> 01:03:52.853
That was completely improper.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:56.398
And that's why I did what I did,
by the book.

01:03:57.734 --> 01:03:59.485
I thank you anyway.

01:04:12.957 --> 01:04:17.086
Radio, Conn, Mr Zimmer, get those
communications back on line now.

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.840
We're working on it, sir.
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:26.595
- Are you ready?
- Ready. Go.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.224
Jesus. This fuckin' thing...

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.018
You know, this whole system
is crashed, radio buoy is severed.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:36.105
- What the fuck does he want us to do?
- Shit electrons?

01:04:36.147 --> 01:04:38.899
Hey, Vossler, we need communications
not smart-ass remarks.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:40.067
Aye, sir.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.611
- All stop, ten degrees up.
- Ten up. Aye, sir.

01:04:42.654 --> 01:04:45.239
All stop. Aye, sir. Enters all stop.

01:05:05.427 --> 01:05:07.970
Conn, Sonar, holy shit, sir!
He's right on top of us!

01:05:08.054 --> 01:05:09.596
He's turning toward!

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:14.601
- Range?
- 600 yards!

01:05:17.522 --> 01:05:22.234
Conn, Sonar, torpedoes in the water!
Bearing 048, 050!

01:05:24.279 --> 01:05:26.155
- Left full rudder!
- Left full rudder! Aye, sir!

01:05:26.281 --> 01:05:27.990
All ahead full! Zero bubble!

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.493
Sir, don't you want to fire back?
Torpedoes are ready, sir.

01:05:31.578 --> 01:05:33.662
No, we're in too close.
Our weapons won't have time to arm.

01:05:33.705 --> 01:05:35.581
All ahead flank!
Chief of the watch to manoeuvring.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:36.748
Give me max speed now!

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:38.125
Maximum speed! Aye, sir!

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:46.508
Sonar, Conn, let me know
when our range to that Akula

01:05:46.593 --> 01:05:48.177
<i>is open to 1,000 yards!</i>

01:05:48.219 --> 01:05:50.846
- Conn, Sonar, aye, sir!
- Damn it! Let's just shoot this fucker!

01:05:50.889 --> 01:05:52.389
What's 1,000 yards for?

01:05:52.474 --> 01:05:54.558
'Cause it takes 1,000 yards
for the torpedoes to arm!

01:05:54.642 --> 01:05:56.310
Jesus! Who'd you fuck
to get on this ship?

01:05:59.397 --> 01:06:03.734
<i>Conn, Sonar, torpedoes 150 yards
and closing fast, sir!</i>

01:06:03.818 --> 01:06:07.529
<i>Bearing 070, 074!</i>

01:06:09.449 --> 01:06:10.532
Launch port countermeasures!

01:06:14.245 --> 01:06:16.246
- Countermeasures away, sir!
- Rig ship for impact.

01:06:16.331 --> 01:06:17.956
Rig ship for impact! Aye, sir!

01:06:30.762 --> 01:06:33.388
They missed! They missed!
They passed astern!

01:06:33.431 --> 01:06:35.182
<i>They were too close to arm, sir.</i>

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:38.769
Conn, Sonar, range to the Akula,
950 yards and opening fast!

01:06:38.853 --> 01:06:41.188
Go to manual on the arming
mechanisms, tubes two and four.

01:06:44.359 --> 01:06:45.442
Snapshot, two and four.

01:06:45.527 --> 01:06:47.486
Snapshot, two and four.
Tubes fired electrically, sir.

01:06:57.288 --> 01:06:59.915
Sonar, Conn, give me exact ranging
and speed on our weapons.

01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:02.417
Range, 300 yards at 50 knots, sir!

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:08.131
<i>200 yards, 50 knots!</i>

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:13.470
100 yards, 55 knots!

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:17.224
75 yards!
Weapons ready for arming, sir!

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.768
- Steady course 231.
- Aye, sir. 231.

01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:22.813
Arm torpedoes two and four...

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:26.817
- Now!
- Torpedoes armed, sir!

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.614
We're locked on the Akula!

01:07:45.712 --> 01:07:47.629
You got him, sir! You got him!

01:07:57.223 --> 01:08:01.393
Conn, Sonar, incoming torpedo!
They got it off before they got hit, sir!

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.520
Right full rudder!
Launch starboard countermeasures!

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:07.733
- Countermeasures away, sir!
- Dive! Make your depth 1,200 feet!

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.651
Point it down now!
Take her deep! Take her deep!

01:08:09.694 --> 01:08:11.862
Full dive on those planes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:08:14.282 --> 01:08:16.033
Hang on, everybody!

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.941
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah!

01:08:56.948 --> 01:08:59.785
Open aft main drain suction!

01:08:59.993 --> 01:09:03.080
Start the drain pump! Go, go, go!

01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:09.086
All stations,
make damage report to Control.

01:09:10.421 --> 01:09:14.216
Control, this is Bilge Bay!
We've got out-of-control flooding!

01:09:14.801 --> 01:09:17.094
Request damage control!

01:09:17.178 --> 01:09:19.470
Mr Mahoney, get a
damage control party down there!

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.764
Aye, sir!

01:09:20.848 --> 01:09:22.849
Forward damage control party,
get Lieutenant Hellerman!

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.060
Flooding in the bilge bay!
Get him down there now!

01:09:29.857 --> 01:09:32.901
Conn, Manoeuvring,
we've lost propulsion, sir!

01:09:32.984 --> 01:09:34.528
Chief of the Boat, how we doin'?

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.738
Sir, we are going down!
I need propulsion!

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:38.948
Forward ballast tanks
are damaged, sir!

01:09:39.033 --> 01:09:41.535
Forward air pressure: Zero!

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.955
Manoeuvring, Conn,
restore propulsion as soon as possible.

01:09:45.038 --> 01:09:47.707
Conn, Manoeuvring, restoring
propulsion as soon as possible!

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.875
Aye, sir!

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:05.392
Control, Bilge Bay, flooding is slowed!

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:07.436
<i>I think we got it under control, sir!</i>

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.189
Passing 1,500 feet.
At 1,850 it's all over.

01:10:28.583 --> 01:10:30.292
Passing 1,600 feet.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:45.390
Barnes, get over here!
Help me with this loose valve!

01:10:58.446 --> 01:11:00.572
Passing 1,650 feet.

01:11:10.374 --> 01:11:13.168
- What the fuck is going on?
- Take it easy.

01:11:25.807 --> 01:11:28.850
Conn, Bilge Bay,
flooding has recommenced!

01:11:28.935 --> 01:11:31.102
It looks like three men are trapped!

01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:35.232
Bilge Bay, Conn, try and get those men
out of there and seal that bay.

01:11:35.316 --> 01:11:38.068
Sir, if we don't seal the bilge bay now,
we'll lose the ship!

01:11:40.738 --> 01:11:43.698
Bilge Bay, Conn,
can you get the men out?

01:11:43.783 --> 01:11:46.743
Sir, there's no fuckin' way!
If I go down there, I'll never get out!

01:11:48.996 --> 01:11:50.914
Barnes, come on! You've got to come!

01:11:50.998 --> 01:11:55.877
<i>Move, move! Barnes, come on,
come on! You can do it! Move it!</i>

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.713
Bilge Bay, Conn, seal that bay.

01:11:58.798 --> 01:12:01.550
Barnes, let's go! Come on!
I've got to close the hatch!

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:06.221
What the fuck are we doing here?

01:12:07.223 --> 01:12:09.933
Bilge Bay, Conn,
I say again, seal that bay.

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:12.686
Sir, there are men down there,
and they're gonna drown!

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:15.564
Lieutenant Hellerman,
you have your orders!

01:12:15.606 --> 01:12:18.400
Now seal the goddamn bay
before we all go down!

01:12:18.442 --> 01:12:22.237
Barnes! Please get the fuck out!

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:27.325
Barnes!

01:12:31.998 --> 01:12:36.001
Come on! Barnes!

01:13:09.493 --> 01:13:11.411
Conn, Bilge Bay,

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.915
seawater hatch is sealed, sir!

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.797
Very well.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.975
Passing 1,800 feet.

01:13:34.769 --> 01:13:37.228
Approaching hull crush depth, sir.

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:02.003
1,825.

01:14:02.463 --> 01:14:04.547
Conn, Manoeuvring,
turbine power restored!

01:14:04.632 --> 01:14:07.133
<i>Main seawater cross valve repaired!</i>

01:14:14.558 --> 01:14:18.144
<i>- And rising.
- Propulsion limit! Ahead full, sir!</i>

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:21.523
- Take us up to periscope depth.
- Aye-aye, sir.

01:14:41.585 --> 01:14:42.877
Give me five.

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:54.931
All right, we're livin'.
We're livin', gentlemen.

01:15:09.822 --> 01:15:11.906
- Step aside, Tommy.
- I'm sorry, sir. The X.O. ordered...

01:15:11.949 --> 01:15:13.491
Fuck the X.O.!

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:18.997
This ship has been hit,
and I'm going in to see my captain.

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.707
Now stand aside.

01:15:22.168 --> 01:15:23.585
Stand aside!

01:15:27.381 --> 01:15:28.631
Captain?

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:36.347
- Sir.
- How bad is it, Mr Dougherty?

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:38.099
It's bad, sir.

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:42.062
I've just been looking
at Hunter's file here.

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:45.523
The closest to combat he's been
is a policy seminar.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.484
Give me an order, sir.

01:15:48.235 --> 01:15:52.947
As quietly as you can, you get
to Mr Zimmer and Mr Westergaurd.

01:15:54.158 --> 01:15:55.950
How about Linkletter?

01:15:56.035 --> 01:15:59.329
You won't be able to talk
to the TSO. He's at the conn.

01:15:59.413 --> 01:16:02.457
But you can get to Weps.
We got to have Weps. He's the key.

01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:06.920
You get me those men, a small security
force, then come back and get me.

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:08.046
Aye, sir.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:11.132
Don't get overzealous and
try to recruit the whole ship.

01:16:11.217 --> 01:16:15.136
- We'll lead from the top down.
- Aye, sir. Right away.

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:24.437
The radio's 50%.

01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:29.400
Can I talk to you in the passageway?

01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:32.028
Right now, Pete. Come on.

01:16:47.795 --> 01:16:48.962
What's goin' on?

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:51.339
We're not gonna let this go down
with the X.O. at the helm.

01:16:51.423 --> 01:16:53.049
- We're not?
- No, we're not.

01:16:53.134 --> 01:16:55.552
I've been with the captain for years
and this asshole Hunter shows up,

01:16:55.636 --> 01:16:57.804
and I'm supposed to follow him
'cause he says so?

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.181
You're not supposed to,
you've been ordered to.

01:17:00.224 --> 01:17:02.183
That's what this is about,
proper orders.

01:17:02.268 --> 01:17:05.228
Proper orders? He has proper orders.
He won't act on them.

01:17:05.312 --> 01:17:07.689
He's in command now!

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:12.235
If they order him to launch, we'll
launch, and we'll blow 'em all to hell.

01:17:12.319 --> 01:17:14.779
But I'd rather go down myself
than get this one wrong.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:17.198
Look, our procedures are clear.

01:17:17.283 --> 01:17:20.702
In the absence of a contravening order,
in a situation like this,

01:17:20.744 --> 01:17:23.329
- we follow the orders in hand.
- Exactly.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:26.541
You know how many checks we do to
make sure a launch order is authentic?

01:17:26.584 --> 01:17:28.293
The X.O. agreed with those orders.

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.795
Now he just wants to throw them away?
They don't count?

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.716
- He's lost his nerve.
- Bullshit! I know this guy, Bobby!

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.593
Weps, we've been ordered to launch.

01:17:36.677 --> 01:17:37.969
Now why in the world would we do that

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.971
if they weren't prepared
to launch at us?

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:43.099
We don't know that for sure.
That's the whole point.

01:17:43.184 --> 01:17:45.143
That's why he wants time
to confirm the message.

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:48.146
That's the whole fucking point
is we don't have time!

01:17:48.939 --> 01:17:52.233
Radchenko is fueling his birds.
Now why do you think he's doing that?

01:17:52.276 --> 01:17:56.154
Why? You don't put on a condom
unless you gonna fuck!

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:01.075
Go back to your station.
Go back to your station and stay there.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:05.580
Come on, man.

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:10.084
Peter, think about your family, man.

01:18:10.586 --> 01:18:13.254
I am. I am!

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:23.431
I mean, what do you plan to do?

01:18:23.515 --> 01:18:26.893
Nothing without you.
You're senior officer department head.

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:28.269
The TSO's with Hunter.

01:18:28.354 --> 01:18:30.521
And you have the keys
to the small arms locker.

01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:32.649
Now we want to recruit
a few more men,

01:18:32.733 --> 01:18:35.235
and then
we're gonna open that arsenal.

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:39.697
I just talked to the captain in his room.
He specifically asked for you.

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:42.367
He says we cannot go without you.

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:45.286
I don't believe this.

01:18:47.831 --> 01:18:49.832
This is a mutiny, Peter.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.043
There's only two sides to a mutiny.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.963
Now, your captain
is asking for your help.

01:18:56.173 --> 01:19:01.511
What are you gonna do?

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:15.316
All right.

01:19:18.696 --> 01:19:21.739
Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:23.324
in 24 minutes.

01:19:41.051 --> 01:19:43.303
You're doing the right thing.

01:19:57.609 --> 01:19:59.986
<i>Electrical power has been restored.</i>

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:03.156
<i>All stations,
prepare to reinitiate the system.</i>

01:20:07.828 --> 01:20:11.873
Radio, Conn, Mr Zimmer,
what's the status on that radio repair?

01:20:12.291 --> 01:20:14.292
Conn, Radio,
all systems are still down, sir.

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:15.918
Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.

01:20:16.003 --> 01:20:18.379
<i>- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.591
Very well.

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:29.640
- Mr Mahoney has the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:31.309
- Cob.
- Sir?

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.644
- Send a man and find Zimmer.
- Aye, sir.

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:36.731
- Get a side arm.
- Aye-aye, sir.

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:38.900
- Chief Young.
- Aye, Chief.

01:20:41.528 --> 01:20:43.363
Turn around! Move it!

01:20:44.531 --> 01:20:46.157
At ease, sailor.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.666
Sir.

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:57.835
Thank you, Mr Ince.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.295
- Mr Westergaurd.
- Sir.

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:01.881
- Mr Zimmer.
- Ready, sir.

01:21:03.634 --> 01:21:05.426
Let's get on with it.

01:21:07.971 --> 01:21:09.430
Stand guard.

01:21:15.062 --> 01:21:17.772
All you people, return to your stations!

01:21:18.524 --> 01:21:19.941
- Mr Rivetti.
- Sir?

01:21:20.025 --> 01:21:22.360
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:40.128
Is there a problem, sir?

01:21:44.091 --> 01:21:46.300
These are the keys
to the entire submarine.

01:21:55.227 --> 01:21:58.813
Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability

01:21:58.856 --> 01:22:00.356
in 21 minutes.

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:02.483
Who's in charge here?

01:22:02.526 --> 01:22:04.360
Shit!

01:22:04.695 --> 01:22:07.321
Me, sir. Oh, fuck.

01:22:08.699 --> 01:22:11.325
- How long is it gonna take?
- I don't know, sir.

01:22:12.244 --> 01:22:14.245
- Do you know what's going on here?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:17.623
No, I don't think you do.
Let me explain it to you.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.209
If we launch and we're wrong,

01:22:20.294 --> 01:22:22.545
what's left of Russia
is gonna launch at us.

01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:24.922
There will be a nuclear holocaust
beyond imagination.

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:27.717
So it's all about knowing, Mr Vossler.

01:22:28.093 --> 01:22:30.011
We have to know
whether or not our order to launch

01:22:30.053 --> 01:22:31.095
has been recalled or not.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.974
The only way we're gonna know is if
you fix that radio. You understand me?

01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:36.309
Yes, sir.

01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:39.187
You ever watch Sfar Trek?

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.689
<i>- Yeah, I seen Sfar Trek.
- Star Trek. You know, Star Trek.</i>

01:22:41.773 --> 01:22:43.232
The USS Enterprise. All right.

01:22:43.317 --> 01:22:45.526
You remember when the Klingons
were gonna blow up the Enterprise?

01:22:45.611 --> 01:22:48.613
And Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty,
"Scotty, I gotta have more power."

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.448
He needs more, more warp speed.
Yeah.

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:51.532
Warp speed. Exactly.

01:22:51.617 --> 01:22:54.035
Well, I'm Captain Kirk.
You're Scotty. I need more power.

01:22:54.077 --> 01:22:57.121
If you do not get this radio up,
a billion people are gonna die.

01:22:57.206 --> 01:23:01.542
It's up to you. I know that's a shitty
deal, but you got it. Can you handle it?

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.796
Scotty?

01:23:08.967 --> 01:23:10.426
Aye, Captain.

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:14.347
You got anything?

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:16.140
- No, Vossler.
- Then get on it.

01:23:23.815 --> 01:23:26.567
- I have the conn.
- X.O. has the conn.

01:23:26.902 --> 01:23:29.362
Chief of the Boat,
make your depth 75 feet.

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:31.155
Continue up to periscope depth.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.907
Belay that order!

01:23:46.672 --> 01:23:52.176
Any officers or chiefs feel you've been
unjustly caught up in this thing,

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:54.136
you stand with me now.

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:36.095
Sir, propulsion has been restored.

01:24:36.763 --> 01:24:39.140
All flooding has been contained.

01:24:41.018 --> 01:24:43.477
All communications are still down.

01:24:49.526 --> 01:24:51.068
Take him away.

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:54.030
Lock him up in the officers' mess.

01:25:30.025 --> 01:25:31.734
Of all the people.

01:25:42.663 --> 01:25:46.957
Weps, return to missile control.
Mr Zimmer, you stay with me.

01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:49.043
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The rest of you return to your stations.

01:25:49.127 --> 01:25:52.713
Inform your men directly
that the captain is in command.

01:25:52.756 --> 01:25:55.257
- I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

01:25:55.342 --> 01:25:58.219
Diving officer,
make your depth 150 feet.

01:25:58.261 --> 01:26:01.305
- At 150 feet. Aye, sir.
- 1 MC.

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:02.682
Aye, sir.

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:06.227
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

01:26:06.269 --> 01:26:12.233
<i>Crew of the USS Alabama,
attempted mutiny has been put down.</i>

01:26:13.694 --> 01:26:15.778
<i>We'll maintain security alert.</i>

01:26:15.862 --> 01:26:18.698
<i>Authorised movement
only in two-man teams.</i>

01:26:19.533 --> 01:26:21.826
<i>In the absence
of further radio communication,</i>

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.537
<i>on orders from
the National Command Centre,</i>

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:27.123
<i>we'll achieve launch depth
as quickly as we can</i>

01:26:27.207 --> 01:26:29.250
<i>for strategic missile launch.</i>

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:32.044
<i>We all know what this means.</i>

01:26:32.087 --> 01:26:34.797
<i>It's not something one would wish for,</i>

01:26:34.881 --> 01:26:37.591
<i>but we have the obligation
under authenticated orders</i>

01:26:37.634 --> 01:26:41.929
<i>issued by our Commander-ln-Chief
to prevent the attack on our country.</i>

01:26:41.972 --> 01:26:46.434
<i>Russian missiles will have
launch capability in 15 minutes.</i>

01:26:47.102 --> 01:26:48.978
<i>Set condition 1 SQ.</i>

01:26:49.062 --> 01:26:52.356
<i>Spin up missiles one through five
and 20 through 24</i>

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:54.650
<i>for strategic missile launch.</i>

01:26:54.735 --> 01:26:57.945
<i>The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorised.</i>

01:26:57.988 --> 01:27:01.949
<i>This is the captain.
Mr Zimmer is the new X.O.</i>

01:27:04.369 --> 01:27:06.787
<i>Set condition 1 SQ.</i>

01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:13.878
<i>Spin up missiles one through five
and 20 through 24</i>

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:15.588
<i>for strategic launch.</i>

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:18.549
<i>The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorised.</i>

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.259
<i>This is the X.O.</i>

01:27:21.511 --> 01:27:28.476
Weapons, Conn,
confirm target package SLBM 64741/2

01:27:28.518 --> 01:27:31.353
<i>for missiles one through five
and 20 through 24.</i>

01:27:31.438 --> 01:27:34.523
<i>- Target package confirmation, sir.
- This is the captain.</i>

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:49.830
Conn, Weapons,
confirm target package SLBM 64741/2

01:27:49.915 --> 01:27:52.625
for missiles one through five
and 20 through 24.

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:54.251
Aye, sir.

01:28:03.553 --> 01:28:06.430
Look, it's not a mutiny.
I did everything by the book.

01:28:06.515 --> 01:28:08.724
It's not about the book.

01:28:08.809 --> 01:28:12.353
If the Russians are gonna launch
and we do nothing,

01:28:12.437 --> 01:28:13.979
who's gonna stop 'em?

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:16.649
Half of me is glad
the captain came back.

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:18.692
He could be right, you know.

01:28:18.735 --> 01:28:21.362
No orders are valid, Cob,
if they're wrong.

01:28:21.446 --> 01:28:24.573
- We don't know if they're wrong.
- That's true. We don't know.

01:28:24.658 --> 01:28:26.867
That's why we have to find out first.

01:28:34.543 --> 01:28:37.127
What if Radchenko surrendered
and it's over?

01:28:38.255 --> 01:28:41.340
We launch. They see us. They launch.

01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:46.595
Our birds pass each other in the air.
Boom!

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.056
- What do you got?
- Nuclear war.

01:28:49.307 --> 01:28:51.016
Nuclear holocaust.

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:00.526
- What are you doing down here?
- Jesus, I was just going to the bath...

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:02.695
Rivetti, nobody moves alone!
Come on. You know the drill.

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.905
What, Bennefield,
I need an escort to take a shit?

01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:06.407
Shut up!

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.243
Now I'm gonna call Control.
You stay right there.

01:29:09.327 --> 01:29:11.453
- Fuck that.
- I mean it, man.

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:19.420
Okay, Moebius, open the door.

01:29:19.504 --> 01:29:22.172
- You broke my nose, man.
- Shut up, fat boy.

01:29:25.719 --> 01:29:28.429
- Mr Rivetti, I'm impressed.
- I never liked him, sir.

01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:31.432
Rivetti, go to laundry. Get four sets
of coveralls and four caps.

01:29:31.516 --> 01:29:34.268
- Aye, sir.
- Just relax.

01:29:39.566 --> 01:29:41.942
Can I talk to you a second?

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:44.194
Come on.

01:29:46.656 --> 01:29:48.282
- Everybody ready?
- Let's do it.

01:29:58.835 --> 01:30:02.421
- We're with you, sir.
- Let's go.

01:30:11.681 --> 01:30:14.725
- Approaching launch depth.
- Very well.

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:17.645
Make your depth 150 feet.

01:30:18.647 --> 01:30:20.356
Zero bubble. Commence hovering.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.358
Zero bubble.
Commence hovering. Aye, sir.

01:30:22.442 --> 01:30:25.653
Conn, Weapons, estimated time
to weapons system 1 SQ

01:30:25.695 --> 01:30:27.821
three minutes, 30 seconds, sir.

01:30:28.949 --> 01:30:32.660
Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability

01:30:32.702 --> 01:30:33.786
<i>in 12 minutes.</i>

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:35.120
<i>Opening missile hatches.</i>

01:30:52.931 --> 01:30:56.225
<i>- Weps.
- Weps, this is Hunter. Listen to me.</i>

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.770
- Where are you?
- Don't worry about where I am.

01:30:59.938 --> 01:31:00.980
You cannot proceed.

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.564
We got other ships out there
that can handle this.

01:31:02.649 --> 01:31:04.692
You can't be influenced by the captain
or anybody else.

01:31:04.776 --> 01:31:06.110
Make up your own mind.

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.697
Conn, Weapons,
estimated time to missile launch,

01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:11.532
<i>three minutes and counting, sir.</i>

01:31:11.616 --> 01:31:13.784
Weps, Weps, listen. Don't do this.

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:15.619
<i>Don't do this. Once you launch,
they cannot come back.</i>

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:16.870
<i>They cannot come back, Weps.</i>

01:31:16.913 --> 01:31:19.081
<i>And you know the repercussions
if we're wrong, goddamn it!</i>

01:31:19.165 --> 01:31:23.377
Weps, if we fire now, we'll be firing
while we're blind and crippled.

01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:24.503
You understand me?

01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:27.881
<i>- Where the fuck are you?
- Do not remove that firing trigger!</i>

01:31:27.924 --> 01:31:29.883
<i>Do not open the safe, Weps!
It's up to you!</i>

01:31:29.926 --> 01:31:33.637
You're the only one that knows
the combination! It's up to you, Weps!

01:31:33.722 --> 01:31:35.264
It's up to you.

01:31:38.351 --> 01:31:40.352
Mind your fuckin' panel!

01:31:47.193 --> 01:31:49.611
- You guys ready?
- Just about, sir.

01:31:53.366 --> 01:31:55.242
Radio, X.O. Vossler?

01:31:55.285 --> 01:31:57.286
X.O, Radio.

01:31:57.370 --> 01:32:00.539
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- Vossler, calm down. Just calm down.

01:32:00.582 --> 01:32:03.876
<i>- Take a deep breath. Are you calm?
- Yeah, sort of.</i>

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.169
Get the radio fixed, Vossler.

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:07.588
I could have built one by now.
How long is it gonna take you?

01:32:07.672 --> 01:32:09.131
I don't know.

01:32:10.675 --> 01:32:13.052
Well, how much time do you need?

01:32:15.138 --> 01:32:16.263
Shit!

01:32:16.681 --> 01:32:17.931
Let's go.

01:32:21.853 --> 01:32:27.066
Missile tubes one through five
and 20 through 24 at 1 SQ, sir.

01:32:31.196 --> 01:32:35.574
Ship is hovering on automatic.
Dive is at 1 SQ, Captain.

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:39.578
Missiles at 1 SQ. Ready to launch, sir.

01:32:46.377 --> 01:32:48.712
Sir, weapons system is at 1 SQ.

01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:52.758
- Missiles are ready for launch, sir.
- Very well.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.469
- Weapons.
- Aye, sir.

01:32:56.679 --> 01:32:59.598
Weapons, Conn,
remove the tactical firing trigger.

01:33:11.903 --> 01:33:13.862
- 1 MC.
- Aye, sir.

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:18.659
Weapons, this is the captain.
Unlock the tactical firing trigger.

01:33:23.498 --> 01:33:24.623
Weps?

01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:28.836
Missiles are ready to launch, man.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.965
Sir.

01:33:36.636 --> 01:33:37.761
Shit.

01:33:38.638 --> 01:33:42.683
Mr Zimmer, no one is to touch this key.

01:33:43.059 --> 01:33:45.269
I'm going to launch
from missile control.

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:47.604
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Westergaurd.

01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:49.606
- Sir.
- Dougherty. Come with me.

01:33:49.732 --> 01:33:53.277
- Mr Mahoney, take the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:58.365
What are you doing, man?
We're at 1 SQ. We're ready.

01:34:01.077 --> 01:34:02.661
<i>- Mr Dougherty.
- Aye.</i>

01:34:02.704 --> 01:34:05.831
- Station your guards fore and aft.
- Last two, forward hatch!

01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:07.708
First two, aft hatch!

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.545
They're gonna fire from missile control.

01:34:12.922 --> 01:34:15.174
We've got to get back to the conn
and disarm the system. Come on.

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:17.634
We'll travel in the crawl spaces.

01:34:32.734 --> 01:34:34.067
Mr Ince!

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:39.072
Mr Ince, remove the tactical firing key.

01:34:39.949 --> 01:34:41.867
Sir, it is my duty to...

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:45.412
Son, don't talk to me about duty.
Open the fucking safe!

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:57.549
I can't do that, sir.

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:07.267
I'm gonna count to three,

01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:08.769
and then I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off.

01:35:08.853 --> 01:35:09.978
One.

01:35:12.815 --> 01:35:13.941
<i>Two.</i>

01:35:18.196 --> 01:35:19.321
Shit!

01:35:21.699 --> 01:35:23.158
It does me no good to kill you.

01:35:23.243 --> 01:35:26.286
You're the only one
that knows the combination.

01:35:28.665 --> 01:35:30.207
However...

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:35.462
Petty Officer Hilaire
doesn't know the combination!

01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:42.177
Millions of lives at stake here, Peter!
Don't make a dumb decision! One!

01:35:43.972 --> 01:35:47.474
- Two!
- Sir!

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.875
<i>- Cob!
- Yo.</i>

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:16.253
You and Hunsicker are going
to enter the conn from the bow.

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:18.505
Rivetti, Linkletter and myself
will come in through the aft.

01:36:18.548 --> 01:36:20.215
You jump right on Zimmer, okay?

01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:39.818
Come on, come on!

01:36:44.324 --> 01:36:45.699
- Fire control ready?
- Aye, sir.

01:36:45.742 --> 01:36:47.409
- Launcher ready?
- Aye, sir.

01:36:48.494 --> 01:36:49.661
Initiate fire.

01:36:49.704 --> 01:36:51.621
- Freeze! Hold it, sir!
- Drop the weapon now!

01:36:51.706 --> 01:36:54.833
Move forward! Move forward!
Move, move, move! Get his pistol!

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:59.296
- Fire one!
- Number one did not fire, sir.

01:37:01.341 --> 01:37:03.884
Sir, the captain's key
has been removed.

01:37:04.969 --> 01:37:06.178
Hunter.

01:37:07.638 --> 01:37:09.848
- You're a piece of shit.
- Son of a bitch.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.392
All right, you and you,
man the forward hatches.

01:37:12.477 --> 01:37:14.436
- Aye, sir.
- You, man the aft hatches.

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.563
- Aye, sir.
- We're going up to periscope depth.

01:37:16.647 --> 01:37:18.857
We're gonna
reestablish communications

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:21.985
and get that radio message.
Now anybody got a problem with that?

01:37:23.738 --> 01:37:25.322
Chief of the Boat,
make your depth 78 feet.

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:27.032
Aye-aye, sir. Make your depth 78 feet.

01:37:27.075 --> 01:37:29.493
- Five degree up bubble.
- Mr Linkletter, man that periscope.

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:31.244
Aye sir. Raising number two scope.

01:37:31.329 --> 01:37:34.498
Radio, Conn, Mr Vossler,

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:37.834
this is Captain Kirk.
I need warp speed on that radio.

01:37:37.919 --> 01:37:39.211
Yes, sir.

01:37:40.755 --> 01:37:43.465
<i>Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability</i>

01:37:43.549 --> 01:37:45.133
<i>in nine minutes.</i>

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:50.764
- Oh, shit!
- What? What happened?

01:37:50.848 --> 01:37:52.265
Reattach that lead!

01:38:06.072 --> 01:38:08.240
Seventy-eight feet!
At periscope depth, sir!

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:10.409
- Mr Linkletter!
- No close contact, sir.

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:14.037
Very well. Chief of the watch,
raise the VLF radio antenna.

01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:16.081
Raise the VLF antenna. Aye, sir.

01:38:17.834 --> 01:38:19.668
VLF antenna coming up!

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:27.759
Conn, Radio, sir, I think
she's breathing. We're getting close.

01:38:38.604 --> 01:38:40.313
- Halt, sir!
- Shoot me.

01:38:40.398 --> 01:38:42.482
- Shit. Shit.
- I got him.

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:45.944
I have the conn.

01:38:48.448 --> 01:38:50.365
Give me my missile key.

01:38:59.083 --> 01:39:01.585
Give me the missile key, Mr Hunter.

01:39:15.558 --> 01:39:19.603
I'm the commander of this fucking ship!
Give me that goddamn key!

01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:26.860
<i>Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability</i>

01:39:26.944 --> 01:39:28.612
<i>in seven minutes.</i>

01:39:29.989 --> 01:39:31.656
<i>Conn, Radio, sir!</i>

01:39:35.495 --> 01:39:36.536
Radio, Conn!

01:39:36.579 --> 01:39:40.040
Captain, Radio, Vossler, sir. She's
breathing again! We are really close!

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.126
You got three minutes, Vossler.

01:39:43.211 --> 01:39:45.420
- Three minutes and counting!
- Yes, sir.

01:39:48.174 --> 01:39:49.716
You got three minutes.

01:40:00.061 --> 01:40:01.520
Come on.

01:40:19.997 --> 01:40:23.250
Come on, Vossler. Come on, come on.
Keep it going, keep it going.

01:40:30.466 --> 01:40:32.592
Speaking of horses,

01:40:33.928 --> 01:40:36.888
did you ever see
those Lipizzaner stallions?

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:38.557
What?

01:40:39.684 --> 01:40:43.270
From Portugal.
The Lipizzaner stallions.

01:40:44.105 --> 01:40:47.649
The most highly trained horses
in the world. They're all white.

01:40:49.068 --> 01:40:50.360
Yes, sir.

01:40:52.029 --> 01:40:55.574
"Yes, sir" you're aware they're all white,

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:57.576
or "yes, sir" you've seen them?

01:40:59.537 --> 01:41:01.538
Yes, sir, I've seen them.

01:41:01.956 --> 01:41:04.833
Yes, sir, I'm aware that they're all white.

01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:08.753
They're not from Portugal,
they're from Spain,

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:12.757
and at birth, they're not white,
they're black.

01:41:14.677 --> 01:41:15.802
Sir.

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:18.513
I didn't know that.

01:41:19.223 --> 01:41:21.308
But they are from Portugal.

01:41:25.313 --> 01:41:26.354
Come on, Vossler. Come on.

01:41:26.439 --> 01:41:30.817
- Yes. Yes.
- Come on. Come on. You got it.

01:41:33.863 --> 01:41:37.907
Some of the things they do dety belief.

01:41:39.285 --> 01:41:42.162
Their training programme
is simplicity itself.

01:41:42.997 --> 01:41:45.206
You just stick a cattle prod up their ass,

01:41:45.291 --> 01:41:47.876
and you can get a horse to deal cards.

01:41:48.919 --> 01:41:50.670
Simple matter of voltage.

01:41:59.430 --> 01:42:01.222
You're gonna get it. Come on.

01:42:03.809 --> 01:42:05.977
I almost had it. You saw it.

01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:08.021
Conn, Weapons,

01:42:08.648 --> 01:42:12.442
<i>Russian missiles will have
launch capability in four minutes.</i>

01:42:15.029 --> 01:42:17.864
- There you go! There you go!
- Ah, shit!

01:42:22.453 --> 01:42:25.955
Look, look, look! Look at it, Vossler!
There we go, there we go!

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.040
Yes!

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:36.758
Conn, Radio, we are receiving flash
traffic. Emergency action message.

01:42:36.842 --> 01:42:39.219
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.

01:42:39.261 --> 01:42:40.679
Fuck, yeah!

01:42:41.806 --> 01:42:45.600
Alert one. Alert one.
Dougherty, Westergaurd, Zimmer.

01:42:45.935 --> 01:42:47.894
- Get that EAM.
- Aye-aye, sir.

01:42:51.273 --> 01:42:53.525
God help you if you're wrong.

01:42:54.318 --> 01:42:56.695
If I'm wrong, then we're at war.

01:42:57.863 --> 01:42:59.155
God help us all.

01:43:10.668 --> 01:43:14.421
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message

01:43:14.505 --> 01:43:16.256
from the National Command Authority,
sir.

01:43:16.298 --> 01:43:20.260
- Request permission to authenticate.
- Permission granted. Authenticate.

01:43:27.226 --> 01:43:31.771
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."

01:43:36.569 --> 01:43:39.028
- Message is authentic, Captain.
- I concur, sir.

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.040
I concur, sir.

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:53.460
Message is authentic.

01:44:05.347 --> 01:44:06.473
1 MC.

01:44:08.517 --> 01:44:11.853
<i>Crew of the Alabama,
this is the captain.</i>

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:14.522
Set condition 2SQ.

01:44:17.610 --> 01:44:19.569
Terminate launch, all missiles.

01:44:23.073 --> 01:44:24.908
All right! All right!

01:45:03.113 --> 01:45:05.114
Mr Hunter has the conn.

01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:09.053
<i>In the early hours of this morning,
Russian army forces moved in</i>

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:11.764
<i>and met surprisingly little resistance.</i>

01:46:11.891 --> 01:46:13.766
<i>There were some sporadic battles</i>

01:46:13.851 --> 01:46:16.686
<i>but, apparently, the spectre
of fighting their countrymen</i>

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:20.773
<i>proved too much for these rebel troops
and they surrendered quickly.</i>

01:46:20.816 --> 01:46:22.942
<i>So a crisis
that seemed to be escalating</i>

01:46:23.027 --> 01:46:24.819
<i>beyond the point of no return</i>

01:46:24.904 --> 01:46:28.281
<i>was ultimately resolved with fewer
than a hundred soldiers dead.</i>

01:46:28.324 --> 01:46:30.533
<i>And the nuclear base
captured by Radchenko</i>

01:46:30.618 --> 01:46:32.785
<i>is back in government hands.</i>

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.622
<i>Reporting live from
the French aircraft carrier Foch</i>

01:46:35.664 --> 01:46:37.582
<i>in the Mediterranean Sea,</i>

01:46:37.625 --> 01:46:40.335
<i>this is Richard Valeriani for CNN.</i>

01:46:50.512 --> 01:46:52.430
All right, stand there,
Lieutenant Commander Hunter.

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:54.307
This won't take long.

01:46:54.475 --> 01:46:57.769
This panel has convened in order
to investigate the events

01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:00.897
subsequent to the setting
of condition 1 SQ

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:03.024
for strategic missile launch

01:47:03.108 --> 01:47:05.777
on board the USS Alabama
on 1 November.

01:47:07.112 --> 01:47:11.532
Now, based on the testimony
from personnel on board the Alabama,

01:47:11.617 --> 01:47:16.496
and, in no small measure, to that
of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey,

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:19.332
I am prepared to make
my recommendations to SUBPAC.

01:47:19.416 --> 01:47:23.044
- Without my testimony, sir?
- You have a problem with that?

01:47:24.088 --> 01:47:26.923
- I might, sir.
- I have known Captain Ramsey

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:28.800
for almost 30 years.

01:47:29.343 --> 01:47:32.512
We served together
on more than a few occasions.

01:47:32.554 --> 01:47:36.057
If he is lying, this will be
the first I've heard of it.

01:47:36.141 --> 01:47:37.266
Yes, sir.

01:47:37.726 --> 01:47:41.354
My primary concern here
is the breakdown in the system.

01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:45.149
In this instance, the system failed

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:50.321
because the two senior officers did not
work to resolve their differences

01:47:50.364 --> 01:47:52.865
while preserving
the chain of command.

01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:56.452
Now you may have been
proven right, Mr Hunter,

01:47:56.537 --> 01:47:59.956
but insofar as the letter of the law
is concerned,

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.833
you were both right.

01:48:02.292 --> 01:48:04.877
And you were also both wrong.

01:48:06.005 --> 01:48:10.633
This is the dilemma that will
occupy this panel, this Navy,

01:48:10.718 --> 01:48:14.178
and this country's armed forces
as a whole,

01:48:14.221 --> 01:48:16.556
long after you leave this room.

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:23.730
Off the record, you've both
created one hell of a mess.

01:48:24.314 --> 01:48:29.235
A mutiny aboard a United States
nuclear submarine,

01:48:29.278 --> 01:48:32.905
violation of nuclear launch protocol.

01:48:36.869 --> 01:48:39.871
For the record,
it is the conclusion of this panel

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:42.498
that your actions aboard the Alabama

01:48:42.583 --> 01:48:45.460
were consistent with
the best traditions of the Navy,

01:48:45.544 --> 01:48:47.754
and in the interests
of the United States.

01:48:47.838 --> 01:48:52.425
As such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept

01:48:52.509 --> 01:48:56.596
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country,

01:48:57.598 --> 01:49:01.642
Captain Ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.

01:49:02.352 --> 01:49:07.815
And based, in no small part,
on Captain Ramsey's recommendation

01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:11.611
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter
be given his next command

01:49:11.695 --> 01:49:14.322
at the earliest possible convenience.

01:49:16.033 --> 01:49:19.786
Unless, of course, you wish
to challenge these recommendations.

01:49:20.287 --> 01:49:21.537
No, sir.

01:49:22.623 --> 01:49:24.916
- Captain Ramsey?
- No, sir.

01:49:27.628 --> 01:49:28.961
Dismissed.

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:43.434
Captain?

01:49:58.826 --> 01:50:00.993
Just wanted to say thank you.

01:50:01.495 --> 01:50:03.871
You were right, and I was wrong.

01:50:07.918 --> 01:50:11.337
About the horses, the Lipizzaners.
They are from Spain, not Portugal.

01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:15.690
Yes, sir.
