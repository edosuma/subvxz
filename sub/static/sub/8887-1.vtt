00:39.421 --> 00:43.118
Meet a real Fab family,
the Carrolls of Charleston, South Carolina.

00:43.325 --> 00:46.920
l'm a fanatic about clean clothes.
That's why l'm glad for Fab.

00:48.430 --> 00:52.093
Dummies. Borax won't work
unless you put active enzymes in.

00:52.334 --> 00:54.393
You geek! How do you know all that?

00:54.469 --> 00:56.198
-l'm not a geek.
-Yes, you are.

00:56.271 --> 00:57.602
-Am not.
-Are too.

00:57.673 --> 00:59.163
l'll show you geeky!

01:06.281 --> 01:08.215
Hurry up, it's coming on!

01:08.283 --> 01:09.978
Batman!

01:14.957 --> 01:16.219
Batman!

01:17.659 --> 01:19.149
Stupid old TV.

01:19.328 --> 01:21.819
Holy bad reception, Batman. l'll fix it.

01:27.603 --> 01:29.195
Hurry up or we'll miss it!

01:29.738 --> 01:31.069
Hurry!

01:32.174 --> 01:34.506
Where worms always go...

01:35.377 --> 01:36.935
...down into the earth.

01:37.012 --> 01:39.742
-ls it working?
-No, not yet.

01:41.850 --> 01:43.784
That's it! Don't move.

01:46.254 --> 01:47.687
Your glasses!

01:49.591 --> 01:52.321
Remember, never hit a man with glasses.

01:53.662 --> 01:57.393
-Even better. Perfect!
-Yes!

02:04.873 --> 02:06.704
Yeah, keep flushing.

02:21.223 --> 02:22.713
Back to back!

02:28.864 --> 02:31.890
Who's playing with the toilet?
Kevin, is that you?

02:36.405 --> 02:41.342
Boy! l'm going to peel the skin off
of your behind, boil it and make soup!

02:41.910 --> 02:43.741
To the Batpoles!

02:44.246 --> 02:45.611
What did l say?

02:46.248 --> 02:50.548
Stay out of my kitchen!

03:35.764 --> 03:38.392
Stop that, or l'm calling the police!

03:38.467 --> 03:40.594
Shut up, you crusty old bitch!

03:41.002 --> 03:43.835
That must be your mama
you're thinking about.

03:45.073 --> 03:46.973
Thanks for the help, lady.

03:50.278 --> 03:53.611
-Help me. l'm hurt.
-Get off the car, you bum!

04:03.358 --> 04:05.553
Kevin, is that your grandma--

04:19.841 --> 04:23.106
-Good morning, Grandma.
-Don't good morning me.

04:23.945 --> 04:28.712
You could've at least fed that little heifer.
Making all that noise last night.

04:28.784 --> 04:32.447
Good thing you're so quick,
otherwise l'd never have gotten no sleep.

04:32.521 --> 04:36.548
They were beating up a man in the alley
this morning. Cops did nothing.

04:36.691 --> 04:39.455
Do you blame 'em?
They haven't been paid in two weeks.

04:39.528 --> 04:43.294
That'll change when Assemblyman Harris
is elected mayor. You watch.

04:43.365 --> 04:46.334
Grandma, one man cannot save the world.

04:46.401 --> 04:49.234
l don't live in the world.
l live in this neighborhood...

04:49.304 --> 04:52.762
...and Harris is the only candidate
to ever set foot in it.

04:53.241 --> 04:56.904
-What do you want for breakfast?
-l'll just have some coffee. l got to run.

04:56.978 --> 05:00.209
All you do is run. Now, come on, sit down.

05:00.649 --> 05:04.141
Let your grandmother fix you
a nice hot meal.

05:04.286 --> 05:07.949
We're not kids anymore, Grandma.
We're grown, remember?

05:25.340 --> 05:28.036
-Good morning, Grandma.
-'Morning, Poopski.

05:28.376 --> 05:31.174
-'Morning, Kevin.
-Darryl, man, come on.

05:31.246 --> 05:35.478
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
l heard you talking to yourself.

05:36.551 --> 05:40.180
l was working on my latest creation.

05:40.255 --> 05:44.089
A sound-activated,
aerodynamic insect predator.

05:44.759 --> 05:47.592
-A what?
-A flying flycatcher.

05:48.430 --> 05:53.424
You are a genius! Just like your mama.
May angels bless her soul.

05:53.935 --> 05:57.871
One of these days he'll blow us up
with one of those damn inventions.

05:58.406 --> 06:00.499
Shouldn't you be at work already?

06:01.476 --> 06:04.138
-Wait, Kevin, l got something for you.
-l got to go.

06:04.212 --> 06:06.043
lt's okay! J-5 will bring it.

06:12.387 --> 06:15.185
Make the turn, make the turn.
Watch out for Grandma.

06:16.157 --> 06:18.091
There you go. Watch the wall.

06:20.362 --> 06:24.731
-l've got to oil his ball bearings.
-You need to throw that in the trash.

06:26.368 --> 06:28.131
-Here you go.
-What is that?

06:28.203 --> 06:32.264
A two-way transceiver radio belt.
Put this in your ear...

06:32.340 --> 06:37.004
...and talk into the buckle.
lt also has a radio tracking device.

06:37.112 --> 06:40.172
You need to get that out of my face.
l'm not wearing that crap.

06:40.248 --> 06:42.079
-Please, Kevin?
-No!

06:45.587 --> 06:47.179
Kevin. Come here.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.619
-He's retarded!
-Come here!

06:50.692 --> 06:53.627
He should invent some hair
for that bald head of his.

06:53.695 --> 06:54.855
Now!

07:04.639 --> 07:06.664
Give me the belt. l'll wear it.

07:06.775 --> 07:11.644
No, you don't have to wear
my stupid old belt if you don't want to.

07:12.147 --> 07:15.207
Darryl, please. May l wear your belt?

07:16.451 --> 07:18.783
Are you sure
that you really, really want to?

07:18.853 --> 07:22.380
Yeah, l'm really, really sure
l'd like to wear your belt.

07:22.457 --> 07:24.357
'Cause you really, really don't have to...

07:24.426 --> 07:28.021
...if you really, really don't want to.
And l'd be really, really upset if--

07:28.096 --> 07:29.529
Give me the damn belt!

07:31.599 --> 07:34.932
This is great, Kevin.
Now we can talk together all day long.

07:36.237 --> 07:38.671
l'll be home late. l got a karate class.

07:38.873 --> 07:40.670
l'll radio you in about an hour.

07:40.742 --> 07:44.303
Then every hour on the hour after that
just to work all the bugs out.

07:44.379 --> 07:46.506
lf l'm not there, leave a message.

07:47.949 --> 07:49.439
Oh, you'll be there.

07:50.819 --> 07:52.411
l'll track you down.

08:21.516 --> 08:24.007
Wait, wait, wait! Thank you.

08:33.727 --> 08:35.217
Great day, isn't it?

08:35.663 --> 08:39.360
Why don't we see?
''GM lays off 500 more employees.

08:40.034 --> 08:42.868
''A post-office worker
wipes out an entire zip code.

08:43.104 --> 08:45.971
''And the police are threatening
to walk out on a strike.''

08:46.041 --> 08:48.305
l just meant the sun was gonna shine.

08:48.576 --> 08:51.636
l hadn't gotten to the lame
come-on section yet.

09:00.455 --> 09:03.049
So, l guess we'll probably talk later, right?

09:05.493 --> 09:06.585
She's shy.

09:06.928 --> 09:09.192
Who let you out
of the Hard Edition dungeon?

09:09.264 --> 09:11.960
This is the newsroom.
You know she's out of your league.

09:12.300 --> 09:15.360
Stevens, they're all out of your league.

09:15.837 --> 09:19.705
l heard you won a toaster
at the sperm bank. Got to go. Got to run.

09:20.408 --> 09:23.070
Down, brother. Down into the basement.

09:23.711 --> 09:25.178
'Bye, basement boy.

09:27.282 --> 09:30.342
Yeah! Blood on the hands,
blood on the hands!

09:31.286 --> 09:33.015
Lift him out of the trunk.

09:33.321 --> 09:36.813
Hear that bone break?
That's journalism, my friend!

09:36.891 --> 09:38.085
That's journalism!

09:38.159 --> 09:40.923
Walker! l watched your piece
on the Mayor last night.

09:40.995 --> 09:44.522
Boring!
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

09:44.732 --> 09:47.292
lt's got no angle, no edge. Listen...

09:49.504 --> 09:52.496
...if you can't get anything real,
go to the board.

09:57.879 --> 09:59.403
The Vice President...

10:01.583 --> 10:02.948
...and an alien...

10:04.686 --> 10:06.176
...have S & M sex!

10:06.521 --> 10:08.250
Now that's a great story.

10:08.957 --> 10:13.860
My sources connect Mayor Gates
to Michael Minelli and organized crime.

10:14.596 --> 10:16.757
''My sources link Gates to Minelli.''

10:17.065 --> 10:19.260
Who will you interview? Gates?

10:19.334 --> 10:23.293
He won't talk to us since we made up
that shit about him on the sheep farm.

10:23.371 --> 10:24.895
Nope. Minelli.

10:27.675 --> 10:31.111
Right. You get an interview
with Michael Minelli...

10:31.346 --> 10:34.474
...l'll promote your ass so high
you'll be shitting off the moon.

10:34.549 --> 10:38.212
ln the meantime,
l forbid you to watch any more 60 Minutes.

10:38.786 --> 10:43.189
Remember, l want edge.
lt's not Hard Edition, it's--

10:43.258 --> 10:46.227
-Hard Edge-dition, right.
-That's my boy.

10:46.594 --> 10:49.028
Boy? Shit, l'm a man.

10:49.097 --> 10:50.394
-What?
-Nothing.

10:55.603 --> 10:56.865
This is great.

10:57.405 --> 10:59.236
This is going to be perfect.

11:02.076 --> 11:03.407
Darryl.

11:05.013 --> 11:08.779
This was a toaster
when Mrs. Reem brought it in.

11:09.284 --> 11:10.581
What is it now?

11:11.519 --> 11:13.749
lt's better than a toaster, Mr. Crudd.

11:13.821 --> 11:16.688
lt's a toaster plus.
Wasted heat from the toast...

11:16.758 --> 11:20.216
...rises up to the pan cooking the egg,
which in turn heats the coffee.

11:20.295 --> 11:23.696
Once the coffee starts to percolate,
the eggs flip out onto the toast.

11:23.765 --> 11:25.960
Just make it a toaster again.

11:26.034 --> 11:27.023
Okay?

11:31.873 --> 11:33.101
What is that?

11:33.508 --> 11:36.204
A sound-activated,
aerodynamic insect predator.

11:36.411 --> 11:38.208
l don't like the looks of that.

11:38.279 --> 11:42.443
Don't be afraid of it. lt's like a dog.
lf you run from it, it'll chase you.

11:43.484 --> 11:47.318
l want that out of here.
You need to be fixing things.

11:51.292 --> 11:53.283
Now look at that mess!

11:56.598 --> 11:58.964
-What are you doing with that thing?
-Down, boy.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.991
What happened? ls that all right there?

12:02.503 --> 12:05.995
Apparently, the fly left the room.
lt's activated by the buzz.

12:08.977 --> 12:11.343
You are in big trouble.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.447
-Now, you just clean up this mess.
-Yes, Mr. Crudd.

12:30.298 --> 12:32.323
What's the plus and minus on it?

12:33.001 --> 12:35.799
Good. That's great news, Betty.
Give it to Mark.

12:36.738 --> 12:38.399
Listen up, everybody!

12:39.440 --> 12:43.308
We just got our latest poll results
and we're five points up!

12:45.947 --> 12:47.414
Thanks to you!

12:48.116 --> 12:51.608
l want to promise you
that when we're elected...

12:51.919 --> 12:54.786
...nothing is going to stand in the way
of the things...

12:54.856 --> 12:58.087
...we promised to do in this campaign.
That's a guarantee.

12:58.626 --> 13:01.959
Harris! Harris!

13:03.731 --> 13:06.962
What are you doing here?
The garbage goes in the back.

13:07.635 --> 13:10.900
-Give me that.
-Eleanor. Get your hands off of her!

13:13.007 --> 13:16.670
l want to wish Mr. Harris luck.
l understand you're doing well in the polls.

13:16.744 --> 13:18.735
Maybe we can talk somewhere private?

13:18.813 --> 13:22.806
Anything you say to me, you can say
in front of them. We have no secrets.

13:24.218 --> 13:25.617
All right then.

13:26.788 --> 13:29.586
l understand you're going to need
campaign contributions...

13:29.657 --> 13:33.218
...and l would like to contribute.
A cool $1 million.

13:34.062 --> 13:35.962
Save your money, Mr. Minelli.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.532
You can't buy me.

13:40.802 --> 13:43.430
How about l rent you for a couple of years?

13:45.807 --> 13:47.604
You can't even window-shop.

13:48.609 --> 13:51.009
lf you'll excuse me,
l got a press conference--

13:51.079 --> 13:53.445
Wait a minute. l want to talk to you.

13:53.948 --> 13:56.348
Hey, Harris! Don't walk away!

14:02.023 --> 14:05.515
Nice office you got here.
Don't work too hard!

14:06.961 --> 14:09.225
Especially you, lady. Life is short.

14:10.965 --> 14:12.899
So must be that thing in your pants.

14:33.988 --> 14:35.922
Caught me stealing coffee!

14:36.791 --> 14:39.885
l hear the coffee downstairs
is even greasier than the reporting.

14:40.395 --> 14:42.329
So now you know l work at Hard Edition.

14:43.364 --> 14:45.161
l hear you're a good cameraman.

14:45.233 --> 14:48.532
You've been asking about me?
Here, let me give you my card.

14:48.603 --> 14:50.161
You don't need to sneak around.

14:50.338 --> 14:53.102
The digits are right here.
The first one's the office...

14:53.174 --> 14:56.837
...the other one's the important one,
that's the phone by the bed.

14:56.911 --> 14:59.004
l bet that one doesn't ring much.

14:59.113 --> 15:00.603
l'll think about it.

15:08.623 --> 15:11.456
Kevin, it's me! Come in. Over.

15:12.927 --> 15:15.361
-What?
-Kevin, are you there? Over.

15:15.530 --> 15:19.523
-Darryl, not now, please!
-l can't hear you. Talk into the buckle.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.866
-l said, ''Not now.'' l'm busy.
-Closer. l can't hear you.

15:23.938 --> 15:26.805
-Not now.
-Closer. Over.

15:27.241 --> 15:29.072
-Not now, l'm busy.
-Closer. Roger.

15:29.143 --> 15:31.304
This is as close as l can talk.

15:32.480 --> 15:36.917
l would love to play with you,
but now is not the time. l got work to do.

15:37.718 --> 15:40.619
When l've finished my work,
we'll go in the bathroom.

15:40.721 --> 15:43.918
l'll play with you then.
Make sure everything's working.

15:43.991 --> 15:45.686
We can check you out.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.096
l thought about it.
And l just changed my mind.

15:57.872 --> 15:59.772
l wasn't talking to my jammy!

16:00.508 --> 16:01.566
Oh, damn.

16:19.894 --> 16:21.885
$5 from the Johnsons.

16:22.363 --> 16:25.821
They don't have two nickels
to rub together, and they still pitched in.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.391
People know a good cause
when they see one.

16:29.437 --> 16:33.464
Nobody moves! Give me all your money!
Now! That's it!

16:33.875 --> 16:36.309
-That, too! Hand it over!
-They're checks.

16:36.377 --> 16:37.708
Hand it over!

16:37.778 --> 16:41.441
You ought to think about showering
if you want to remain anonymous.

16:50.258 --> 16:54.422
Good evening.
Michael Minelli sends his regards.

17:54.956 --> 17:56.787
Stop it! What are you doing?

17:56.857 --> 17:58.085
Darryl, talk.

17:59.026 --> 18:01.153
You haven't said a word all night.

18:01.462 --> 18:03.453
What are you doing? Stop this!

18:04.432 --> 18:06.263
Help me, somebody!

18:07.268 --> 18:08.360
Come here!

18:14.909 --> 18:16.934
He's got a knife!

18:17.011 --> 18:18.740
Oh, God, l'm going to die!

18:26.354 --> 18:27.844
Thank you, young man.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.468
The rest of you ain't shit!

18:43.270 --> 18:46.762
Gee whiz, Kevin. Look what's happening
to our neighborhood.

18:47.608 --> 18:49.633
They're gambling right out in the open.

18:49.877 --> 18:51.708
They're just throwing bones.

18:52.813 --> 18:56.044
Look at that car.
They have no respect for the law anymore.

18:56.117 --> 18:59.416
They're selling drugs
right across the street from our house!

18:59.487 --> 19:02.820
Darryl, it's a crack house.
That's what they do, sell crack.

19:02.890 --> 19:05.688
They shouldn't be doing that.
They're apes.

19:05.793 --> 19:07.317
That's a crack house.

19:08.529 --> 19:10.190
Come here! Darryl!

19:10.564 --> 19:13.624
You can't walk in no crack house!
Those people are animals.

19:13.701 --> 19:17.569
-They'd sell their own babies for a hit.
-That's why someone should close it down!

19:17.638 --> 19:19.105
l got news for you, Urkel.

19:19.173 --> 19:21.801
You don't need a permit
to open up a crack house.

19:21.876 --> 19:24.572
You close that one,
another one'll open up next to it.

19:24.645 --> 19:26.636
You can't walk around like some vigilante.

19:26.714 --> 19:29.342
-Why not? Batman did it.
-Batman?

19:29.984 --> 19:34.819
That was fantasy. He had everything.
You live in reality. You got nothing.

19:35.156 --> 19:37.056
You're no Batman.

19:38.659 --> 19:40.149
Maybe l ought to be.

19:43.330 --> 19:45.161
Bring your goofy ass on!

20:02.049 --> 20:04.449
lt's politics as usual in the Mayor's Office.

20:04.518 --> 20:08.716
Newly elected Mayor Marvin Harris has
reappointed to the building commission...

20:08.789 --> 20:12.350
...several reputed associates
of crime lord Michael Minelli.

20:13.027 --> 20:15.188
So much for campaign promises.

20:15.329 --> 20:18.662
ln other news:
With no end to the budget crisis in sight...

20:18.833 --> 20:23.964
...unpaid police continue a citywide work
slowdown. Which raises the question:

20:24.872 --> 20:28.364
As crime escalates,
who will keep our streets safe?

20:28.542 --> 20:31.375
l'm Kimberly Jonz
and l'm saying good night.

21:07.982 --> 21:09.643
-Darryl!
-What?

21:10.017 --> 21:12.349
What's going on?
What are you doing in there?

21:12.419 --> 21:13.408
l'm busy.

21:14.155 --> 21:17.056
Come on.
Stop all that noise. Let's go back to bed.

21:17.491 --> 21:20.983
Wait! Don't go yet!
l want to show you something!

21:21.762 --> 21:23.252
Kevin, are you ready?

21:23.597 --> 21:27.294
You better be because here l come!

21:29.804 --> 21:32.364
Look, l'm a crime fighter!

21:34.041 --> 21:35.201
What do you think?

21:35.276 --> 21:37.574
lf you walk out on the street like that...

21:37.645 --> 21:41.012
...they're going to arrest you
and lock you in the nuthouse.

21:41.215 --> 21:44.707
No, Kevin, this is real.
The costume is bulletproof.

21:44.785 --> 21:48.721
Besides, look at all these great gadgets.
See, these are handcuffs.

21:48.789 --> 21:53.817
And l got stink bombs,
made from concentrated flatulence.

21:53.894 --> 21:56.260
l collected it while you were sleeping.

21:58.465 --> 21:59.955
Kevin, look at these.

22:01.702 --> 22:03.966
Electric nunchakus.

22:10.711 --> 22:11.678
Sorry.

22:12.079 --> 22:13.478
This is a nightmare.

22:13.547 --> 22:17.210
No, Kevin Walker. The best is yet to come.

22:17.885 --> 22:19.876
l made you an outfit, too.

22:20.721 --> 22:24.555
J-5, retrieve crime fighting outfit.

22:26.694 --> 22:29.219
That's it. Get out now, Darryl!

22:34.368 --> 22:38.828
Remember you said Batman had a costume
with gadgets? Well?

22:38.906 --> 22:41.067
No, l said Batman had money.

22:41.275 --> 22:45.507
Which is why l got to go back to bed
to wake up to make some for me and you.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.109
Kevin, don't you want to make the world
a safer place?

22:55.456 --> 22:57.117
l've been up all night.

22:57.258 --> 23:01.092
Ever since my grandmother died,
he's just getting worse and worse.

23:01.428 --> 23:05.592
l got bills to pay.
l can't even afford to pay for the funeral.

23:08.002 --> 23:10.664
How's that lesbian
necrophiliac story coming?

23:11.605 --> 23:13.095
Thanks for the love.

23:14.008 --> 23:15.839
Hello, Betty!

23:19.647 --> 23:20.636
Hello.

23:23.217 --> 23:27.711
-What are you doing down here?
-l came to see if you were busy tonight.

23:27.855 --> 23:31.382
l'm not busy tonight. What do you want
to do? You want to go out to eat?

23:31.458 --> 23:33.824
That's not exactly what l had in mind.

23:33.894 --> 23:36.454
l got a guy who's gonna snitch
on Michael Minelli...

23:36.630 --> 23:39.622
...and my best cameraman's sick,
so l'm desperate.

23:40.367 --> 23:41.766
So you come to me?

23:43.404 --> 23:47.864
lt's not exactly sheep whipping
or public spankings, but it's a job.

23:48.509 --> 23:51.171
lf things go well, it could be full-time.

23:51.745 --> 23:54.612
You said you want to do real news.
Here's your chance.

23:54.848 --> 23:56.645
-You in or out?
-l'm in.

23:57.418 --> 24:00.581
l'm not in exactly where l want to be,
but l'm in.

24:03.857 --> 24:06.917
Darryl, l got great news!
l got a real news assignment!

24:08.028 --> 24:09.017
Darryl!

24:12.800 --> 24:15.132
Darryl, l got a real job.

24:27.114 --> 24:28.604
My God.

24:41.628 --> 24:45.962
Car 6239, report to 425 West 10th Street.

24:46.033 --> 24:48.365
Disturbance in alley of building.

24:53.707 --> 24:55.106
Hey! Wait for me!

24:56.443 --> 25:00.971
-Take me to 10th Street. On the double.
-lt's not my route. l go to the Southside.

25:01.048 --> 25:04.108
You don't understand!
There are innocent lives at stake.

25:04.184 --> 25:06.584
l need your assistance. l'm a crime fighter!

25:06.653 --> 25:09.281
Sure you are. Listen, pal, look in the back.

25:09.590 --> 25:13.492
You're a freak, just like them.
Why don't you get in the back or get out?

25:13.827 --> 25:17.888
Driver, take me to 10th Street now!

25:18.399 --> 25:20.560
Get out of here!

25:25.172 --> 25:26.764
l want my money, girl!

25:26.940 --> 25:29.431
l don't have it, Biff, l swear.

25:30.144 --> 25:31.941
Listen!

25:32.246 --> 25:36.342
You better come up with it or l'll have
to slap you around. Understand?

25:36.417 --> 25:38.578
l wouldn't do that if l were you.

25:42.289 --> 25:44.621
What the hell is this?
ls the circus in town?

25:44.691 --> 25:46.556
Get out of here before l hurt you.

25:46.627 --> 25:47.855
Let the lady go.

25:47.928 --> 25:50.226
-You want to take her place?
-No.

25:51.865 --> 25:53.833
But l will if l have to.

25:55.936 --> 25:59.599
l'll beat you like you're one of my bitches.

26:00.607 --> 26:03.201
Then slap me around and call me Susan.

26:07.114 --> 26:09.105
l warned you, Susan.

26:28.368 --> 26:30.302
Someone should help that lady.

26:35.909 --> 26:39.242
You give up or you want me
to get rough with you?

26:39.546 --> 26:41.343
Listen, you little creep...

26:41.415 --> 26:45.545
...you got three seconds
to get the hell out of here!

26:45.619 --> 26:47.280
-One--
-Two, three.

26:48.122 --> 26:49.714
Go ahead and shoot me.

26:54.962 --> 26:56.657
Look what you made me do!

26:56.730 --> 26:59.062
l had to kill a guy in this goddamn alley!

26:59.133 --> 27:00.623
Give me my money!

27:02.269 --> 27:03.827
Want to try it again?

27:04.771 --> 27:06.363
What the hell are you?

27:09.042 --> 27:10.703
Try shooting him in the head.

27:10.844 --> 27:12.778
Yeah, shoot him in the head.

27:12.846 --> 27:14.177
That's right.

27:15.115 --> 27:16.912
l'll shoot him in the head.

27:35.035 --> 27:36.627
Let's get out of here. Come on.

27:36.703 --> 27:40.571
Don't call me by my real name.
You're blowing my secret identity.

27:40.641 --> 27:43.235
Nobody knows who you are.
Let's go, Loonyman!

27:43.410 --> 27:45.241
l don't believe you.

27:45.312 --> 27:46.643
l almost had him.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.609
Did you like my Bruce Lee stuff?

27:48.682 --> 27:51.583
That's what l was going to do.
l was gonna karate chop--

27:51.652 --> 27:52.949
Just come on.

27:56.690 --> 27:57.816
Hey, Chuck...

27:59.393 --> 28:00.917
...you got to hear this.

28:01.328 --> 28:03.228
Tell him who you've come to see.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.625
l want to speak to the Commissioner.

28:09.336 --> 28:11.133
Tell him why. Tell him why.

28:11.205 --> 28:13.696
l'm a crime fighter.

28:15.108 --> 28:17.406
l had a run-in with some punks last night.

28:17.477 --> 28:21.379
l'm trying to get police cooperation
as l take these street punks down.

28:22.149 --> 28:23.946
l don't see what's so funny.

28:24.284 --> 28:26.445
What about your name?
Tell him your name.

28:27.421 --> 28:31.858
Okay. l don't have one yet.
But l'm leaning toward Brotherman.

28:34.394 --> 28:36.521
ls there someone behind me?
What's the joke?

28:36.597 --> 28:39.498
l got a name for you.
How about Shithead Man?

28:41.068 --> 28:42.763
l want to see the Commissioner.

28:45.172 --> 28:46.537
l'll go get him.

28:48.775 --> 28:50.265
Oh, Commissioner?

28:52.212 --> 28:54.544
Shithead Man's here to see you!

28:55.249 --> 28:58.184
-He's busy.
-This is not a joke.

28:58.685 --> 29:02.781
l'm not leaving here, darn it,
until l see the Commissioner!

29:06.260 --> 29:09.491
The judge said he can go
as long as you take him to a shrink.

29:09.563 --> 29:11.155
Thanks a lot, Officer.

29:11.732 --> 29:14.565
'Bye, guys. And remember what l said:

29:15.068 --> 29:18.003
A life of crime is a waste of what?

29:18.071 --> 29:19.402
-Eat me.
-Take a hike!

29:21.074 --> 29:23.702
l really think l reached a couple of them.

29:25.612 --> 29:27.079
Darryl, what is this?

29:27.147 --> 29:29.672
An aerial view of the Fiji lslands.

29:30.417 --> 29:31.441
And this?

29:31.952 --> 29:34.045
A decorative lncan burial mask.

29:34.588 --> 29:35.919
And these?

29:38.458 --> 29:39.925
That's a tough one.

29:44.931 --> 29:46.023
l'll pass.

29:46.099 --> 29:47.828
You sure you want to pass?

29:52.873 --> 29:55.034
The South American ''Twitsue'' butterfly.

29:55.475 --> 29:57.170
l got to tell you, Kevin:

29:57.244 --> 30:02.147
Not only is your brother normal,
he's actually rather brilliant.

30:02.215 --> 30:04.911
The only problem l see is he's a geek.

30:04.985 --> 30:10.013
No, no, no. He's got problems.

30:10.090 --> 30:13.389
He thinks he's a superhero.
Tell him how you're a superhero.

30:14.428 --> 30:16.794
l'm not a superhero, silly-billy.

30:17.497 --> 30:21.593
Are you going to chump me?
Tell him how you fight crime.

30:25.472 --> 30:28.669
l'm an ordinary citizen.
The police fight crimes.

30:28.809 --> 30:30.868
What's gotten into you lately?

30:31.912 --> 30:33.311
He is a superhero.

30:33.380 --> 30:37.840
Last night, when we were fighting crime,
he got shot. Bullets bounced right off him!

30:37.918 --> 30:41.046
See, he invented a jacket
that bullets bounce right off.

30:41.121 --> 30:45.785
l can't get any sleep lately because of him.
There's this female at my workplace.

30:45.859 --> 30:49.260
She thinks l'm not right,
'cause she caught me talking to my nuts.

30:49.329 --> 30:51.160
You were talking to your testicles?

30:51.231 --> 30:53.961
No! l was talking to Darryl
through my belt buckle.

30:54.034 --> 30:56.127
You were talking to Darryl's testicles?

30:56.636 --> 30:57.796
No.

30:58.372 --> 31:00.101
Tell me about your mother.

31:00.674 --> 31:05.668
You say one more thing about my mother,
l'll kick you in the side of your head!

31:07.414 --> 31:09.245
There's a lot of anger here.

31:09.716 --> 31:12.310
ls there this much anger around the house?

31:12.419 --> 31:15.445
lt's like living with
a swollen Gary Coleman.

31:21.995 --> 31:26.227
Why did you do that?
Now that doctor thinks l'm crazy.

31:27.134 --> 31:30.001
Why didn't you tell him
about the superhero thing?

31:30.103 --> 31:32.435
And give away my secret identity?

31:33.840 --> 31:35.774
So you're not going to give this up.

31:35.842 --> 31:37.366
This is my calling!

31:37.444 --> 31:40.242
l have to make the world a safer place
for my children.

31:40.313 --> 31:43.805
Your children?
You got to be with a woman first!

31:43.984 --> 31:47.317
You got to knock some boots, man!
You're a virgin!

31:49.389 --> 31:50.981
No, l'm a gentleman.

31:52.392 --> 31:54.326
This is obviously something...

31:54.561 --> 31:58.019
...you've got to do
to work through Grandma's death.

31:58.098 --> 32:02.034
lf that's what you've got to do, fine.
But we'll do this together.

32:02.335 --> 32:04.667
But we will do it my way.

32:05.839 --> 32:07.670
Okay, Karateman!

32:07.841 --> 32:10.002
-What?
-That's your crime fighter name.

32:10.076 --> 32:12.408
No, no. Don't call me that.

32:15.649 --> 32:19.312
You call this fighting crime,
housing patrol?

32:19.953 --> 32:22.353
Can't we at least wear the costumes?

32:22.522 --> 32:25.491
Hell, no.
l'm not putting on them stupid costumes.

32:25.559 --> 32:27.493
Help me! You got to help me!

32:27.561 --> 32:29.961
-ls someone following you?
-No, no!

32:30.030 --> 32:32.021
A lady in my building needs help!

32:32.098 --> 32:34.623
-Holy needy neighbor!
-ls she getting kidnapped?

32:34.701 --> 32:36.362
-No!
-Her house is on fire?

32:36.436 --> 32:38.427
No! She's stuck in the elevator.

32:39.005 --> 32:40.768
Right. We got a situation.

32:41.441 --> 32:43.807
-You are going to help her, right?
-Yeah.

32:43.977 --> 32:46.707
-What building is she in?
-Follow me.

32:47.747 --> 32:51.046
-Where are you going?
-l got to get something. l'll be back.

32:54.387 --> 32:56.548
Help! ls anyone there?

32:59.125 --> 33:03.289
We'll try and get you out as soon
as we can, but you got to be patient, okay?

33:04.331 --> 33:05.662
Step back!

33:06.132 --> 33:07.292
What's that?

33:08.168 --> 33:10.261
lt's called the ''Speculum of Life.''

33:23.717 --> 33:27.209
Okay. Step back. There's fire in the hole.

33:33.827 --> 33:35.055
l'm going in.

33:36.796 --> 33:37.785
Come on!

33:39.032 --> 33:41.660
Grab on. l'll lower us down.

33:44.404 --> 33:46.235
Sure, do it your own way.

33:50.377 --> 33:53.073
She's pregnant. We'll need an ambulance.

33:53.179 --> 33:56.512
-l'll radio for help.
-l'm in labor!

33:56.583 --> 33:58.881
-l'm going to have this baby right now.
-Mayday!

33:58.952 --> 34:02.149
We've got a pregnant situation
at 13 Fillmore Street.

34:02.222 --> 34:04.554
l need assistance now, please.

34:10.931 --> 34:14.264
Hang on, l'm coming down. Just hang on!

34:20.739 --> 34:23.436
l'm almost there now.

34:23.510 --> 34:27.639
Just hang on!
l'm almost there, l'm coming!

34:27.981 --> 34:29.312
Keep breathing.

34:30.850 --> 34:33.876
Okay, help is on its way.
What we gonna do?

34:34.087 --> 34:35.987
We're going to have to deliver this baby.

34:36.056 --> 34:38.422
We can't do that.
We'll have to see her thing!

34:38.491 --> 34:41.221
Just get down there and catch this baby.

34:43.830 --> 34:45.627
-lt's so ugly.
-Just do it!

34:48.835 --> 34:49.960
Push.

34:50.603 --> 34:51.900
Take my hand.

35:02.449 --> 35:05.213
-You have a big finger.
-Thank you.

35:06.286 --> 35:09.813
Whatever you're doing, it's working.
l'm starting to see something.

35:10.123 --> 35:12.284
l see a head. lt's coming.

35:17.030 --> 35:18.520
lt's coming!

35:33.046 --> 35:34.206
lt's a boy!

35:34.648 --> 35:35.979
lt's a boy!

35:39.753 --> 35:41.015
l'm a father.

35:47.027 --> 35:49.052
Can you let go of my finger now?

35:51.731 --> 35:54.666
-Where's the baby?
-He's bringing him up.

35:54.734 --> 35:57.726
He delivered him. He saved me.

36:13.319 --> 36:15.787
-How wonderful!
-Great photo.

36:16.122 --> 36:17.384
You're a hero.

36:28.902 --> 36:30.563
You were wonderful.

36:30.837 --> 36:32.099
Who are you?

36:36.342 --> 36:37.536
What?

36:38.445 --> 36:40.276
He's gone blank, ma'am.

36:42.449 --> 36:43.711
Blankman.

36:44.851 --> 36:46.876
Well, you're a true hero, Blankman.

36:51.558 --> 36:52.889
Blankman.

37:52.118 --> 37:53.449
Help, Blankman!

37:53.686 --> 37:57.087
Help! Fe-fe's stuck under the house!

37:57.157 --> 37:59.648
Don't worry. l'll save your little puppy.

38:01.294 --> 38:04.263
Please save him. Please, please!

38:07.734 --> 38:09.258
Hi, Fe-fe.

38:16.910 --> 38:20.778
Come on, give me the money!
Come on! Hurry up!

38:37.764 --> 38:40.927
Our closing story is a hopeful one,
for a change.

38:41.401 --> 38:44.859
lt's about a caped crusader
who calls himself Blankman.

38:45.438 --> 38:49.932
Numerous reports have come from police
and citizens about his heroic exploits.

38:50.276 --> 38:53.871
ln a city where joblessness
and lawlessness run rampant...

38:53.947 --> 38:57.542
...it's hard to believe that goodness
is coming back in style.

38:57.784 --> 39:01.276
Well, if it is,
this reporter just wants to say thanks.

39:01.621 --> 39:06.115
Keep doing what you're doing.
Apparently one man can make a difference.

39:15.635 --> 39:17.364
Minelli wants to see you.

39:17.971 --> 39:20.303
Good. l want to see him, too.

39:24.077 --> 39:25.567
How you doing, Mr. Mayor?

39:25.645 --> 39:29.081
Listen, the DA is investigating
that Civic Center thing.

39:29.148 --> 39:31.048
l want to shut that thing down.

39:31.117 --> 39:35.019
Don't worry about no witnesses.
We'll take care of that.

39:35.321 --> 39:38.313
Not only will the investigation continue,
but...

39:38.658 --> 39:42.719
...l'm going to recommend to the DA
that he issue a warrant for your arrest...

39:42.795 --> 39:44.524
...for bribery and extortion.

39:44.597 --> 39:47.327
You're kidding me, right? Are you bluffing?

39:48.434 --> 39:50.061
You're negotiating.

39:54.474 --> 39:58.808
You're not kidding me, you're not bluffing,
you're not negotiating.

40:00.179 --> 40:01.908
You're asking for trouble?

40:02.515 --> 40:03.675
Yeah.

40:05.618 --> 40:07.245
l'm asking for trouble.

40:12.025 --> 40:13.515
You're going to get it.

40:20.333 --> 40:21.925
What's all this stuff?

40:23.436 --> 40:27.429
Neat, isn't it? People keep sending
this stuff to Blankman as a gift.

40:27.774 --> 40:29.435
They even sent money.

40:29.709 --> 40:31.108
Really? How much?

40:31.344 --> 40:33.539
One guy sent $5,000.

40:33.613 --> 40:35.103
Great! Where is it?

40:35.181 --> 40:36.705
l gave it back.

40:36.783 --> 40:39.411
l told him,
''Send me all your appliances instead.''

40:39.686 --> 40:43.622
l mean, who needs money
when you got neat stuff like this?

40:45.124 --> 40:46.386
Now what is this?

40:46.526 --> 40:48.585
The lower half of a roller blade.

40:51.798 --> 40:54.790
The lower half of a Rollerblade, the bottom.

40:56.736 --> 41:00.263
Have you lost your mind?
l guess we know you've lost your damn....

41:00.907 --> 41:03.375
Get this shit out of here, man!
Get all of it out!

41:04.043 --> 41:07.035
All of it, Darryl! Get this stuff out!

41:07.380 --> 41:09.041
Give me that!

41:11.384 --> 41:13.113
What did l just throw out there?

41:13.186 --> 41:14.312
Your radio.

41:17.757 --> 41:19.156
Come here, Darryl!

41:19.659 --> 41:20.990
Open up.

41:21.394 --> 41:22.691
Open this door!

41:25.665 --> 41:27.929
''There's a magic in your heart

41:28.301 --> 41:30.166
''lf you open it you'll see

41:30.370 --> 41:32.531
''A shining little face

41:32.739 --> 41:34.730
''that smiles for you and me''

41:35.074 --> 41:36.905
Wait up, J-5!

41:38.244 --> 41:41.543
We got to find us a fortress of solitude.

41:42.382 --> 41:45.874
What do you think, J-5? The Blankstore?

41:47.086 --> 41:48.917
Nah. You're right.

41:49.255 --> 41:50.654
Smells like urine.

41:52.558 --> 41:53.957
What do you think?

41:54.260 --> 41:55.750
The Blankstop?

41:56.095 --> 42:00.088
Nah? You're right.
lt would be too cold in the winter.

42:06.572 --> 42:11.236
An abandoned old subway station.
This is perfect!

42:12.345 --> 42:13.744
Wait up, J-5.

42:17.183 --> 42:20.619
This could be the center
of our citadel of crime fighting!

42:26.359 --> 42:27.724
The Blankstation.

42:29.796 --> 42:30.854
Yeah.

42:35.435 --> 42:38.871
l think we should do a follow-up
on the Minelli scandal.

42:39.205 --> 42:42.572
He's gone underground.
The FBl's frozen all of his accounts.

42:42.809 --> 42:44.276
No. Listen.

42:44.444 --> 42:48.437
l know everybody's been trying to get
an interview with Minelli for years.

42:48.548 --> 42:52.541
But l think what this city needs
is a more uplifting story.

42:53.252 --> 42:56.312
l want to do an interview with Blankman.

42:56.689 --> 42:57.678
Blankman?

42:57.757 --> 43:02.592
He's great for this city. He appears
out of nowhere, he does a good deed...

43:02.662 --> 43:07.622
...and then just disappears. He doesn't do
interviews, seek publicity, he doesn't--

43:07.700 --> 43:09.691
Take money. Yeah, l know.

43:10.937 --> 43:11.904
Now...

43:12.939 --> 43:14.668
...the question is:

43:16.876 --> 43:19.310
ls he really Mr. Wonderful or what?

43:20.213 --> 43:22.579
How do we find him?
How do we track him down?

43:22.648 --> 43:23.706
Who knows him?

43:23.983 --> 43:27.817
Most important,
how do we get him to talk?

43:32.492 --> 43:35.120
l can get you a one-on-one with Blankman.

43:35.728 --> 43:37.355
You can? How?

43:38.831 --> 43:40.321
l just have to employ...

43:40.399 --> 43:44.460
...certain top-secret journalistic techniques
at my disposal.

43:45.171 --> 43:49.164
Please, please, Darryl, do this interview!

43:49.509 --> 43:52.342
Nope. Can't do it. Sorry.

43:52.845 --> 43:56.281
Blankman avoids the press.
He doesn't do this for recognition.

43:56.582 --> 43:59.346
Then do it for me.
l'm trying to make an impression.

43:59.652 --> 44:02.951
Kevin, me, l'd do anything for you.

44:03.556 --> 44:05.615
lt's Blankman. He's got a code.

44:06.559 --> 44:08.789
Don't give me that double-identity stuff!

44:08.895 --> 44:11.159
Either you're going to do this interview...

44:11.230 --> 44:14.791
...or Blankman and Darryl will be living
at the damn train station.

44:14.867 --> 44:17.199
l'm sorry. Just think about it.

44:20.139 --> 44:21.367
Little buddy?

44:21.841 --> 44:23.741
Okay, l'll do it.

44:24.410 --> 44:27.436
Tell her to meet me
at the 14th Street station at 6:00.

44:27.513 --> 44:29.140
You got it!

44:29.348 --> 44:30.975
-Alone.
-Okay.

44:31.617 --> 44:33.517
Tell her to wear a carnation.

44:34.020 --> 44:35.351
Why a carnation?

44:36.889 --> 44:39.084
You wouldn't understand.

44:42.228 --> 44:43.160
Yes!

45:16.996 --> 45:20.329
Quick, jump on. lt's rush hour.
There's a train right behind me.

45:20.399 --> 45:22.128
Hurry up, don't be afraid!

45:22.468 --> 45:24.936
And don't touch the third rail
or you're dead.

45:26.505 --> 45:27.995
Come on!

45:45.024 --> 45:47.458
Looks like the 13
is coming out of the station.

45:47.526 --> 45:49.517
Better switch tracks. Hold on!

45:57.603 --> 45:59.161
What is this thing?

45:59.739 --> 46:01.730
lt's the Blankwheel.

46:03.175 --> 46:05.541
-Where are we going?
-What?

46:06.178 --> 46:08.078
l said, ''Where are we going?''

46:08.414 --> 46:11.076
l can't hear. Let me turn the engine off.

46:15.488 --> 46:16.648
What did you say?

46:16.722 --> 46:18.451
l said, ''Where are we going?''

46:18.524 --> 46:20.515
To the Blankstation.

46:26.332 --> 46:27.594
This is great!

46:28.434 --> 46:29.992
l said, ''This is great!''

46:30.069 --> 46:33.004
l can't hear you. Wait!
Let me turn the engine off.

46:37.643 --> 46:40.271
-What'd you say?
-l said, ''This is great!''

46:47.219 --> 46:48.208
What?

46:49.488 --> 46:50.819
Never mind.

46:51.090 --> 46:53.718
-l can't hear you.
-Never mind!

48:08.334 --> 48:11.861
That was a great ride.
l was starting to get a little dizzy.

48:12.471 --> 48:14.405
Sorry, but l had to make sure...

48:14.473 --> 48:18.273
...that you didn't remember
the secret location of the Blankstation.

48:21.247 --> 48:22.578
Oh, my gosh!

48:23.682 --> 48:24.910
Look at this.

48:25.985 --> 48:30.149
The white zone is for the loading
and unloading of passengers only.

48:30.723 --> 48:32.714
No parking.

48:37.530 --> 48:39.623
Don't be afraid. lt's just J-5.

48:40.800 --> 48:42.290
Hello, Kimberly.

48:43.702 --> 48:46.865
-lt talks.
-That's all he can say right now.

48:47.273 --> 48:50.765
He's programmed to do so much,
l wouldn't want to overload him.

48:50.876 --> 48:52.707
Would you like something to drink?

48:52.878 --> 48:54.038
Yeah. Sure.

49:13.132 --> 49:16.124
-You lost a shoe.
-Oh, yeah. Thanks.

49:23.976 --> 49:27.639
-Look at all this stuff.
-What do you think, J-5?

49:28.848 --> 49:30.679
What do you call this stuff?

49:31.283 --> 49:32.272
Junk.

49:33.352 --> 49:36.515
Yeah. But it's great junk.

49:46.632 --> 49:49.465
lt's almost like you live
in a different world.

49:50.002 --> 49:51.299
A better world.

49:55.441 --> 49:56.703
Are you happy?

49:57.443 --> 50:00.537
How can l be happy when there's still
so much work to be done?

50:04.183 --> 50:06.549
What do you think makes you so special?

50:08.654 --> 50:11.851
l'm not special at all.
l'm just like everyone else.

50:11.991 --> 50:13.652
l want to feel safe at night.

50:13.726 --> 50:15.717
That's what Blankman stands for.

50:16.061 --> 50:20.498
Every man who sees something wrong,
and decides to do something about it.

50:24.069 --> 50:25.400
Hold on.

50:28.007 --> 50:29.634
Do you have any family?

50:30.242 --> 50:33.405
l had a grandma. She meant a lot to me.

50:34.146 --> 50:35.636
Somebody killed her.

50:41.854 --> 50:43.845
This has been an amazing night.

50:44.290 --> 50:46.884
l'm sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

50:48.260 --> 50:51.491
l'm just curious,
what was the carnation for?

50:53.832 --> 50:56.630
A beautiful woman
should always wear a carnation.

50:58.704 --> 51:00.194
Thank you, Blankman.

51:02.575 --> 51:04.042
Or whoever you are.

51:27.533 --> 51:30.593
J-5, what's happening to me?

52:07.206 --> 52:10.334
Everybody's hip to Blankman, right?
Y'all hip to Blankman?

52:10.409 --> 52:13.742
When l first heard on the news
there was a black guy...

52:13.812 --> 52:17.543
...in a cape, riding in a police car,
l said to myself, ''Damn...

52:17.616 --> 52:20.642
''...l hope James Brown
isn't in trouble again.''

52:23.522 --> 52:27.959
Not only has he inspired an entire city
to stand up for itself...

52:28.027 --> 52:32.487
...but take a look at this.
Blankmania's sweeping the nation.

52:32.564 --> 52:35.055
This has caused other super-people...

52:35.134 --> 52:36.965
...to come out of the woodwork.

52:37.036 --> 52:41.132
Midget Man, what inspired you
to become a superhero?

52:41.206 --> 52:45.302
l think Blankman was
an important influence to all of us...

52:45.644 --> 52:48.841
...but it's a big world
and we all have to do our part.

52:48.914 --> 52:50.882
Let's say you're in a situation.

52:50.949 --> 52:53.884
You're being accosted.
Tell us how you deal with it.

52:56.822 --> 52:58.119
First thing....

52:58.524 --> 53:02.358
Easy with that chair. You don't want to....

53:09.368 --> 53:12.565
Gay Man, you work primarily
out of the San Francisco area.

53:12.738 --> 53:15.969
l wanted to be in the Army,
but they discriminate.

53:17.342 --> 53:19.776
And since l'm cruising
on the streets anyway...

53:19.845 --> 53:22.712
...l just thought
l would get out there and....

53:23.515 --> 53:26.746
-What's the matter with you?
-l'm in love.

53:29.822 --> 53:33.053
With who? What? With your robot?

53:33.125 --> 53:34.615
You knocked J-5 up?

53:36.428 --> 53:38.453
l'm in love with Kimberly Jonz.

53:40.432 --> 53:42.900
Who isn't in love with her? Get over it.

53:43.268 --> 53:47.568
Tonight l got the feeling
l was lying on a bed of feathers...

53:48.140 --> 53:52.099
...and there was two Q-Tips in both ears
and they were moving real fast.

53:52.778 --> 53:56.236
You know that feeling you get
when someone you like kisses you?

54:01.653 --> 54:02.881
She kissed you?

54:04.323 --> 54:05.950
Yeah. No.

54:06.859 --> 54:08.724
She kissed Blankman.

54:10.662 --> 54:12.527
And that's the dilemma.

54:13.532 --> 54:16.524
lf she should find out that l'm Blankman...

54:17.603 --> 54:19.571
...it could destroy her.

54:24.710 --> 54:28.544
This was probably like a buddy-buddy kiss,
you know what l mean?

54:29.748 --> 54:31.875
Yeah. You're probably right.

54:34.586 --> 54:37.578
l didn't like that tongue
probing my mouth anyway.

54:39.591 --> 54:40.683
Tongue?

54:48.734 --> 54:51.726
Somebody got some roses.
You read the card?

54:51.804 --> 54:54.102
No. Someone must've dropped them off.

54:56.608 --> 55:00.772
''From your would-be producer
who always produces.'' Me.

55:05.117 --> 55:06.709
Thanks. They're nice.

55:08.387 --> 55:11.686
So, what happened with you
and Blankman last night?

55:13.725 --> 55:16.216
He's kind of wack, right? Tell me.

55:17.763 --> 55:19.424
He is...

55:20.499 --> 55:24.435
...the most wonderful man
l've ever met in my entire life.

55:24.536 --> 55:25.867
Blankman?

55:26.271 --> 55:27.602
Oh, yes!

55:28.440 --> 55:31.603
-You didn't....
-What's this?

55:32.177 --> 55:34.236
Chocolates, which l also brought you.

55:34.313 --> 55:35.803
No, underneath that.

55:38.617 --> 55:42.075
How romantic.

55:42.921 --> 55:46.288
A shoe? A funky old shoe.

55:46.458 --> 55:48.255
We're back from commercials.

55:51.296 --> 55:52.263
Excuse me.

55:56.001 --> 55:59.437
And in five, four, three, two....

56:00.973 --> 56:02.873
Well, Blankman does it again.

56:03.008 --> 56:05.101
Saying he was inspired by his hero...

56:05.177 --> 56:07.805
...Mayor Harris
has come up with a plan to stop...

56:07.880 --> 56:10.440
...the pending police
and city workers' strike.

56:10.515 --> 56:13.279
l've worked out a deal
to honor the city's lOUs.

56:14.152 --> 56:17.849
On Friday, any worker can redeem them
at the First City Bank.

56:18.056 --> 56:20.923
Special armored cars
will bring in all the necessary cash.

56:20.993 --> 56:22.551
And l ask Blankman...

56:22.728 --> 56:26.994
...whoever and wherever you are,
to be on hand to receive a special award.

56:27.633 --> 56:30.534
We are going to start
standing up for ourselves.

56:31.169 --> 56:35.162
This city is going into the Blankman era.

56:38.210 --> 56:42.340
Thank you, Mayor Harris.
Thank you, kind citizens of this great city.

56:43.315 --> 56:46.011
l'd like to take this opportunity to thank...

56:46.585 --> 56:48.746
...someone very special in my life.

56:49.788 --> 56:53.622
Someone who supports me
and believes in what l do.

56:54.893 --> 56:56.485
Someone who...

56:56.561 --> 56:59.792
...whether they know it or not,
has joined me...

57:00.065 --> 57:02.556
...in my quest to fight crime.

57:04.303 --> 57:07.329
This person is a truly wonderful
and unique person.

57:08.106 --> 57:10.267
l'd like to say thank you...

57:10.676 --> 57:12.473
...Kimberly Jonz.

57:18.417 --> 57:19.748
Blankman!

57:24.056 --> 57:25.751
You all want your money?

57:26.792 --> 57:28.453
Let's open the bank!

57:40.739 --> 57:45.233
'Morning, folks.
l got you some happy customers out there.

57:47.045 --> 57:49.775
Don't even think about it!
Put your weapons down, now!

57:49.848 --> 57:52.442
-Put them down! Now get out!
-This is crazy!

57:52.918 --> 57:54.579
-Everybody, get out!
-Stop this!

57:58.924 --> 58:00.186
Don't hurt anybody!

58:00.258 --> 58:03.819
Hello, folks! Say hello to the bad guys!

58:04.029 --> 58:05.360
Calm down.

58:07.265 --> 58:08.732
Everybody, get out!

58:11.269 --> 58:13.260
Move! Let's go!

58:16.274 --> 58:19.038
Are you nuts? There are
100 pissed-off cops outside...

58:19.111 --> 58:22.979
...and they haven't been paid in weeks.
You'll never get through the doors.

58:32.691 --> 58:34.318
Hello, Mr. Mayor!

58:35.761 --> 58:37.490
Anyone can rob a bank...

58:37.562 --> 58:40.156
...but it takes a real man to do it in satin.

58:42.100 --> 58:46.503
Blankman, l'm Police Commissioner Gains.
How do you want to handle this?

58:49.474 --> 58:53.001
-Maybe l could reason with them?
-Great. We'll be right here.

58:53.078 --> 58:54.909
l am not going to let you--

58:55.614 --> 58:58.276
Stay out of it! Blankman will handle it.

59:16.234 --> 59:20.398
''They're gonna kill me
They're gonna smash me like a little bug''

59:20.872 --> 59:22.362
l'm a dead man.

59:22.774 --> 59:24.435
Yes, l'm a dead man.

59:26.111 --> 59:27.271
Hello?

59:28.580 --> 59:30.047
Mr. Burglars?

59:30.882 --> 59:35.148
You think maybe we could talk about
this hostage thing like gentlemen?

59:36.755 --> 59:38.086
Okay.

59:39.858 --> 59:41.052
l tried.

59:42.994 --> 59:45.053
You came to make a deposit, Blankman?

59:45.130 --> 59:47.860
Everybody,
get back before l blow you away!

59:52.938 --> 59:54.929
Hello, Blankman.

59:55.273 --> 59:59.004
What brings you here?
Were they giving away calendars today?

01:00:00.212 --> 01:00:02.203
Michael ''The Suit'' Minelli.

01:00:02.581 --> 01:00:06.017
You'll never get away with this,
you diabolical fiend!

01:00:06.151 --> 01:00:07.379
''Fiend''?

01:00:08.553 --> 01:00:11.920
He's getting those things out
of the funny papers or something.

01:00:12.424 --> 01:00:14.722
What did you do with the Mayor?

01:00:15.026 --> 01:00:18.018
Blankman, l have some good news
about the Mayor.

01:00:18.096 --> 01:00:21.827
They had a recent opinion poll
and the results just came in.

01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:25.893
He's going sky-high!

01:00:29.474 --> 01:00:31.271
Chain him up with the Mayor!

01:00:31.977 --> 01:00:34.138
Everyone, please stay calm.

01:00:34.479 --> 01:00:38.142
Blankman has the situation under control.

01:00:38.383 --> 01:00:42.342
l repeat, Blankman has the situation...

01:00:42.754 --> 01:00:44.187
...under control.

01:00:45.924 --> 01:00:49.758
This bomb will probably take
about ten minutes to be defused.

01:00:50.462 --> 01:00:54.228
So, l think l'm going to set it for...

01:00:56.401 --> 01:00:58.062
...three minutes.

01:01:00.105 --> 01:01:02.835
Now, how can l say it?

01:01:03.508 --> 01:01:05.237
Don't go to pieces.

01:01:06.144 --> 01:01:08.135
Hardy-har-har.

01:01:10.382 --> 01:01:12.816
Okay, boys. We got three minutes.

01:01:12.918 --> 01:01:14.180
Less!

01:01:14.252 --> 01:01:15.514
Let's go!

01:01:16.988 --> 01:01:19.320
Must get to Blankbelt.

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:23.822
Must spray floor with...

01:01:24.563 --> 01:01:27.794
...super-slick Blankgoop.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.360
There.

01:01:31.469 --> 01:01:33.937
Stink bomb. And get...

01:01:34.406 --> 01:01:36.237
...stink bomb to them.

01:01:37.409 --> 01:01:40.310
Hold your breath, Mayor.
This may get funky.

01:01:43.481 --> 01:01:46.644
-That's foul.
-What is that smell?

01:01:47.652 --> 01:01:49.381
Let me out of here!

01:01:52.591 --> 01:01:54.889
See if you can close the vault.

01:01:55.794 --> 01:01:57.022
Tony, the vault!

01:02:00.098 --> 01:02:02.362
-Everybody, get out.
-lt's locked!

01:02:02.968 --> 01:02:05.801
Get out! Everybody, let's go!

01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:08.295
Hurry up, morons!

01:02:09.374 --> 01:02:12.639
Good thinking. At least those scumbags
won't get the city's money.

01:02:13.411 --> 01:02:18.110
One thing they didn't count on,
was my ability...

01:02:20.218 --> 01:02:24.211
...to get myself out of...

01:02:26.758 --> 01:02:28.385
...tight situations.

01:02:29.127 --> 01:02:30.458
Excuse me.

01:02:32.998 --> 01:02:35.489
Stop that guy! Stop him!

01:02:41.039 --> 01:02:42.199
Hello?

01:02:47.712 --> 01:02:51.239
-Go away. lt's not safe.
-Will you get him out of here?

01:02:52.183 --> 01:02:54.344
Oh, my God.

01:02:55.287 --> 01:02:58.723
-What happened here?
-Blankman, would you go?

01:02:59.424 --> 01:03:03.656
-Does this mean what l think it means?
-Will you get him out of here?

01:03:03.728 --> 01:03:05.719
-Do you know what you're doing?
-Yeah.

01:03:05.797 --> 01:03:09.392
All l have to do
is separate this wire, and....

01:03:09.467 --> 01:03:12.459
-No, l don't know what l'm doing.
-Move out of the way.

01:03:12.537 --> 01:03:14.027
You know what?

01:03:14.139 --> 01:03:17.199
This white man is dead.
You can't save him. Let's go.

01:03:17.275 --> 01:03:19.539
-Please, go.
-Let me think.

01:03:19.744 --> 01:03:23.771
Let me think. A positive, B positive....

01:03:23.915 --> 01:03:26.076
A. Think positive.

01:03:27.052 --> 01:03:28.110
l did it!

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.547
You did it!

01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:39.861
-l still hear ticking.
-You hear what?

01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:44.425
Why do l still hear ticking?

01:03:47.572 --> 01:03:49.563
This bag is full of explosives.

01:03:53.545 --> 01:03:55.206
You did what you could.

01:03:55.814 --> 01:03:56.872
Go.

01:03:57.282 --> 01:03:58.306
Go!

01:03:58.717 --> 01:04:01.447
l think he's got a point. Let's just get out.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.881
Wait!

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:11.118
Eleanor Walker was my grandmother.
She really believed in you.

01:04:12.163 --> 01:04:13.960
She was a good woman.

01:04:14.466 --> 01:04:16.434
l'll give her your love.

01:04:17.635 --> 01:04:19.296
The clock, gentlemen.

01:04:20.105 --> 01:04:21.436
The clock!

01:04:23.608 --> 01:04:25.007
Get back!

01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:43.723
That was the bravest thing
l've ever seen anyone do in my life.

01:04:43.795 --> 01:04:46.195
We almost got killed with a boom.

01:04:47.832 --> 01:04:49.663
Mayor Harris is dead.

01:04:49.734 --> 01:04:52.931
You did what you could.
No one else would have gone in there.

01:04:53.004 --> 01:04:56.201
Excuse me! Hello!
Can l at least get a handshake?

01:05:00.378 --> 01:05:02.346
What about my money?

01:05:02.714 --> 01:05:05.774
-l haven't been paid!
-What about our checks!

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:07.249
l want my money!

01:05:07.886 --> 01:05:09.547
We want the check cashed!

01:05:09.621 --> 01:05:11.851
l've got hungry kids at home!

01:05:12.724 --> 01:05:16.182
-Where's our money?
-Blankman was in control here.

01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:18.456
He's a coward. He ran away!

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.192
l told him not to go in there!

01:05:21.266 --> 01:05:23.791
He killed the Mayor! Get him!

01:05:24.903 --> 01:05:27.838
Blankman,
you're responsible and you know it!

01:05:31.543 --> 01:05:34.535
-l think you better get out of here.
-l think you're right.

01:05:44.155 --> 01:05:48.285
Police Commissioner Gains put the blame
squarely on Blankman's shoulders...

01:05:48.359 --> 01:05:54.093
...referring to the fleeing ex-role model as a
''quivering, spineless, world-class coward.''

01:05:54.699 --> 01:05:57.896
Our mistake was in trusting
this supposed hero...

01:05:57.969 --> 01:06:02.963
...who runs around in his grandma's
underwear with a smelly sock on his face.

01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:07.637
We never believed that he'd kill
Mayor Harris and selfishly save himself.

01:06:08.379 --> 01:06:12.475
We're your police department, folks.
We're here to protect and serve...

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:16.042
...not a guy who robs Laundromats
to have a good time.

01:06:18.656 --> 01:06:21.887
l'm not going to do it anymore, J-5. Sorry.

01:06:22.627 --> 01:06:24.117
Hello, Kimberly.

01:06:24.195 --> 01:06:27.096
Don't you make it harder than it already is!

01:06:48.987 --> 01:06:53.549
The procession worked its way through the
downtown area as the city said farewell.

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:58.255
Finally winding down in the neighborhood
where Mayor Harris spent his childhood...

01:06:58.329 --> 01:07:01.389
...among the people
he referred to as ''family.''

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.094
Darryl.

01:07:04.636 --> 01:07:06.627
You got to get over this.

01:07:07.205 --> 01:07:10.663
You've been sitting here
watching this stuff for three days.

01:07:10.742 --> 01:07:12.642
That wasn't your fault.

01:07:17.649 --> 01:07:19.810
All l wanted to do was help.

01:07:22.053 --> 01:07:24.578
You don't have to be a hero, Darryl.

01:07:25.423 --> 01:07:28.358
Why don't you try being
like everyone else?

01:07:30.028 --> 01:07:32.053
How am l going to do that?

01:07:32.864 --> 01:07:34.661
You can start by getting a job.

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:38.531
Hello! Welcome to McDonald's.
May l take your order, please?

01:07:38.603 --> 01:07:40.070
Just a burger, man.

01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:42.106
-Would you like fries with that?
-No.

01:07:42.173 --> 01:07:44.471
They're cooked to crispy,
golden perfection.

01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:46.772
-Yeah, man. l'm sure.
-Perhaps a soda?

01:07:47.145 --> 01:07:48.578
We're doing salads now.

01:07:48.646 --> 01:07:51.740
People don't expect that from McDonald's.
Chunky chicken salad.

01:07:51.816 --> 01:07:54.376
Just give me my damn burger, all right?

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.381
For here or to go?

01:07:59.557 --> 01:08:02.048
He's just a little ''McMad'' right now.

01:08:20.411 --> 01:08:23.243
Hey, my purse! Give me my purse!

01:08:23.648 --> 01:08:25.411
Stop him! Stop him!

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:27.813
Weak, goofy bastard!

01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:41.291
So, this is Hard Edition?

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.292
Michael Minelli.

01:08:47.404 --> 01:08:49.839
Larry Stone. Pleased to meet you.

01:08:50.742 --> 01:08:54.542
-How'd you track me down, Stone?
-This is tabloid TV, we can do anything.

01:08:55.747 --> 01:08:58.078
What is it you want from me?

01:08:58.683 --> 01:09:02.015
Rumor has it
you're looking for the Blankman.

01:09:03.287 --> 01:09:07.724
Everyone knows the Blankman
has disappeared. Nobody's seen him.

01:09:08.626 --> 01:09:10.116
Not for weeks.

01:09:12.263 --> 01:09:14.390
l can give you the Blankman.

01:09:14.732 --> 01:09:16.461
What's in it for you?

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:18.434
Ratings, Mr. Minelli.

01:09:19.103 --> 01:09:21.094
Ratings give me a woody.

01:09:21.973 --> 01:09:25.272
But to get ratings, you got to have a star.

01:09:26.144 --> 01:09:30.513
David Koresh.
Fifty-two days in the number one spot.

01:09:31.282 --> 01:09:35.685
He wanted to run a summer camp.
l said, ''David, why be a counselor...

01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:38.153
''...when you can be the Messiah?''

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:41.754
Now you, l can't make the Messiah.

01:09:42.694 --> 01:09:46.255
But you give me an exclusive interview,
l'll give you the Blankman.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:48.160
l don't make deals.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.091
And l don't do television.

01:09:55.173 --> 01:09:57.038
Where is the Blankman?

01:09:57.642 --> 01:10:01.635
Hey, Einstein, l don't know if you noticed,
but this ain't a boil on my ass.

01:10:02.146 --> 01:10:07.140
lt's a wheelchair. l'm paralyzed
from the waist down. l can't feel a thing.

01:10:09.153 --> 01:10:10.484
l felt that.

01:10:13.658 --> 01:10:14.989
You through?

01:10:20.865 --> 01:10:22.457
l like this guy!

01:10:22.967 --> 01:10:26.027
He ain't got no legs, but he's got balls.

01:10:27.872 --> 01:10:30.841
-Take a walk with me. Have a seat.
-All right.

01:10:35.046 --> 01:10:39.278
l happen to know that Blankman
has the hots for a certain reporter.

01:10:40.051 --> 01:10:42.542
A lady by the name of Kimberly Jonz.

01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:49.460
l had a grandma. She meant a lot to me.

01:10:50.361 --> 01:10:52.022
But somebody killed her.

01:10:55.366 --> 01:10:59.530
Minelli, one time, whacked out an old lady
for giving him a dirty look.

01:11:02.206 --> 01:11:04.231
...not yet released the victims' names...

01:11:04.308 --> 01:11:08.267
...but it is rumored
that among the fatalities is 68-year-old...

01:11:08.346 --> 01:11:13.283
...Eleanor Walker, a local resident who runs
this chapter of the Harris campaign.

01:11:15.286 --> 01:11:19.586
This is Kimberly. l think l figured out
who killed your grandmother.

01:11:27.231 --> 01:11:28.721
Hello. Blankman?

01:11:30.268 --> 01:11:33.032
No, this is not Kimberly. lt's Minelli.

01:11:34.372 --> 01:11:39.708
lf you ever want to see Kimberly again,
come down to the TV station right now.

01:11:40.912 --> 01:11:41.970
Yes.

01:11:42.213 --> 01:11:46.206
And, Blankman,
don't forget to wear your tights.

01:12:02.533 --> 01:12:04.398
-No.
-No. Have a nice day.

01:12:04.602 --> 01:12:07.230
Thank you. Come again.
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.

01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:09.068
Minelli just took over the newsroom.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.574
Sorry, sir, wait in line like everyone else.

01:12:11.642 --> 01:12:14.805
You don't understand.
Minelli just took Kimberly hostage.

01:12:15.713 --> 01:12:17.010
He's got Kimberly?

01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:19.982
He says he's going to kill her
unless Blankman shows up.

01:12:20.051 --> 01:12:23.145
The police ain't doing jack.
You've got to save her.

01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:25.849
l don't want to get involved.
l don't do that anymore.

01:12:25.923 --> 01:12:28.187
l'm normal now.
l'm Darryl Walker, Crew Chief.

01:12:28.259 --> 01:12:31.854
Ronald McDonald's coming next week,
l have to whip this place into shape.

01:12:31.929 --> 01:12:34.625
l'm not talking to Darryl,
l'm talking to Blankman.

01:12:34.732 --> 01:12:36.324
This is serious!

01:12:37.401 --> 01:12:40.063
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.
May l take your order, please?

01:12:40.137 --> 01:12:43.004
-Would you like fries with that?
-Stop it!

01:12:44.308 --> 01:12:46.208
Minelli killed Grandma.

01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:51.942
He killed Grandma?

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.951
Then l got to take him down.

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:00.890
This time l'm with you.

01:13:03.094 --> 01:13:06.257
-You gonna wear your costume?
-l'm not wearing that--

01:13:06.364 --> 01:13:10.266
-l need three more burgers.
-l'll wear the costume. Let's just go!

01:13:10.468 --> 01:13:13.528
-We'll take him down, me and you?
-Yes, let's go.

01:13:13.838 --> 01:13:16.306
-Come on!
-l'll be right back. l got to punch out.

01:13:18.142 --> 01:13:20.633
l can't get the hang of that thing.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.654
Hello, Kimberly.

01:13:31.722 --> 01:13:33.553
No time for small talk, buddy.

01:13:35.459 --> 01:13:37.791
To the Blankscreen.

01:13:40.698 --> 01:13:44.498
l can pull up the plans to the news building
on the Blankscreen.

01:13:45.136 --> 01:13:48.230
They're going to expect us
to come in through here.

01:13:48.306 --> 01:13:51.639
We'll get the drop on them
by coming up in through here.

01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:53.870
Why don't we just go through the front?

01:13:53.945 --> 01:13:57.938
'Cause that'll take all the fun out,
silly-billy gumdrops.

01:13:59.216 --> 01:14:01.980
To the Blanksuits!

01:14:03.187 --> 01:14:06.645
That's your costume.
And l'll once again don...

01:14:07.224 --> 01:14:08.691
...the Blanksuit.

01:14:22.573 --> 01:14:23.801
This is great!

01:14:25.343 --> 01:14:28.107
l said, ''This is fantastic!''

01:14:28.212 --> 01:14:29.702
l can't hear you.

01:14:29.981 --> 01:14:31.846
l said, ''This is great!''

01:14:31.916 --> 01:14:34.248
-l can't hear--
-Shut up and drive!

01:15:03.514 --> 01:15:07.541
Mr. Minelli, you're said to have mob ties.
Have you ever committed a crime?

01:15:07.818 --> 01:15:10.343
No, l've never committed a crime.

01:15:11.522 --> 01:15:13.786
No, goddamn it. No!

01:15:14.425 --> 01:15:19.226
You're asking him all the easy questions.
Probe deeper! Dig into him!

01:15:19.296 --> 01:15:20.593
Edge!

01:15:20.664 --> 01:15:24.156
Right. Edge. Mr. Minelli, are you gay?

01:15:28.039 --> 01:15:30.974
Goddamn! Now that's edge!

01:15:31.876 --> 01:15:35.869
l'm sick and tired of this crap.
You told me Blankman would be here...

01:15:35.946 --> 01:15:40.883
...and he ain't here. Now l not only
have to kill her but you, too.

01:15:41.452 --> 01:15:44.512
Because l'm a gentleman,
l'll kill the lady first.

01:15:44.588 --> 01:15:47.216
Yes, Miss Anchor Lady, this, just in:

01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:49.854
Your time is up.

01:15:51.195 --> 01:15:53.220
Do something. He's crazy!

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:04.634
Check your sources on that story, Minelli.
You might have got a bad lead.

01:16:04.809 --> 01:16:06.140
Blankman.

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:09.837
l see you found someone to work with you
who dresses worse than you do.

01:16:09.914 --> 01:16:11.745
What's your name, other guy?

01:16:11.816 --> 01:16:13.511
l don't have one yet.

01:16:13.584 --> 01:16:16.747
How about ''Poorly Dressed Deadman.''
Get them guys!

01:16:21.425 --> 01:16:23.017
Get in there!

01:16:23.094 --> 01:16:25.494
Get in there and fight! Get them!

01:16:25.563 --> 01:16:26.587
Take them out.

01:16:26.664 --> 01:16:28.723
-They're gaining on us!
-Get up, you idiots!

01:16:28.799 --> 01:16:30.096
Back to back.

01:16:33.104 --> 01:16:35.436
How you doing? Oh, damn.

01:16:58.129 --> 01:16:59.858
l'll handle this myself.

01:17:00.598 --> 01:17:03.158
l got a swell idea for you two.

01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:14.137
lsn't this great?

01:17:14.245 --> 01:17:16.338
We'll never get out of here alive.

01:17:16.447 --> 01:17:21.714
That's the whole plan, Blankman.
While you're in there, l have rigged up...

01:17:21.785 --> 01:17:24.379
...a secret bomb that is going to go off...

01:17:24.455 --> 01:17:27.447
...and blow up this building in five minutes.

01:17:27.525 --> 01:17:29.823
Holy double jeopardy.

01:17:30.494 --> 01:17:31.688
You're good.

01:17:31.862 --> 01:17:36.856
When this bomb goes off,
you'll be held responsible. Post mortem.

01:17:38.469 --> 01:17:39.936
Minelli!

01:17:40.638 --> 01:17:41.764
Look.

01:17:41.839 --> 01:17:43.670
You got what you wanted.

01:17:44.008 --> 01:17:45.600
Let Kimberly go.

01:17:45.676 --> 01:17:48.167
-Put me down, too. You don't want me.
-No.

01:17:48.245 --> 01:17:49.837
The broad stays.

01:17:50.981 --> 01:17:53.711
Stone, l'm sorry l messed up your show.

01:17:54.485 --> 01:17:55.816
Not at all.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.147
Then l'm sorry l ruined your life.

01:18:00.457 --> 01:18:02.755
ls this the end of our episode?

01:18:03.561 --> 01:18:07.156
Will the Dynamic Duo
defy their death defying...

01:18:07.231 --> 01:18:10.098
...drowning death trap? Or--

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:14.263
Who will dislodge Other Guy's fist
from Blankman's eye?

01:18:14.338 --> 01:18:17.034
Quit messing around! This is serious!

01:18:17.107 --> 01:18:19.598
Kevin, stop being a pessimist.

01:18:19.944 --> 01:18:23.436
This tank is not half full, it's half empty.

01:18:24.148 --> 01:18:26.981
That's great. You have lost your mind.

01:18:27.084 --> 01:18:29.075
This is life or death.

01:18:29.887 --> 01:18:33.220
lf my plan serves me correctly...

01:18:34.124 --> 01:18:36.957
...J-5 should be gingerly on his way.

01:18:51.642 --> 01:18:54.611
You'll see. He's coming.

01:19:37.021 --> 01:19:38.147
J-5!

01:19:38.422 --> 01:19:40.014
Hello, Kimberly.

01:19:40.357 --> 01:19:44.418
Save them! Do something! Hurry, J-5.

01:19:46.563 --> 01:19:48.895
Do it, J-5! Save them!

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:07.516
Kick the glass.

01:20:07.651 --> 01:20:10.950
The holes have weakened the glass!

01:20:11.021 --> 01:20:12.511
You can do it!

01:20:23.267 --> 01:20:26.236
-We got to cut the chains!
-We got to find the bomb.

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:29.104
There's no time. lt could be anywhere.

01:20:30.007 --> 01:20:33.340
Save yourself.
There's no point in us all dying.

01:20:34.278 --> 01:20:36.439
l'll never forget you, my lover.

01:20:41.018 --> 01:20:42.610
That's a Blankjoke.

01:20:43.987 --> 01:20:48.390
You're so wonderful to keep your sense
of humor during such a time of crisis.

01:20:51.729 --> 01:20:55.028
Electronics. Think about electronics.

01:20:55.566 --> 01:20:56.590
J-5!

01:20:56.667 --> 01:21:00.330
Quick! Vacuum power pack, on!

01:21:03.874 --> 01:21:08.038
Dry these little wings
so these birdies can fly.

01:21:08.579 --> 01:21:10.774
Blankman, you're such a poet.

01:21:11.248 --> 01:21:12.909
Don't you know it?

01:21:16.887 --> 01:21:19.856
Wait. How are we going to find a bomb
in this building?

01:21:19.923 --> 01:21:21.083
We can't.

01:21:21.892 --> 01:21:23.291
But J-5 can.

01:21:23.627 --> 01:21:28.155
l'll switch him to antiterrorist,
bloodhound, bomb-sniffing mode.

01:21:28.232 --> 01:21:31.724
Okay, J-5, smell the explosive.
Smell it, boy.

01:21:33.337 --> 01:21:35.737
Find the explosive, boy. Find it!

01:21:35.806 --> 01:21:38.240
Go, J-5! Go, boy!

01:21:38.575 --> 01:21:41.408
-He's got something.
-He's on to something.

01:21:41.478 --> 01:21:42.706
Go, J-5.

01:21:44.381 --> 01:21:47.214
Go. What is it, baby?

01:21:49.887 --> 01:21:52.879
The women's bathroom. That fiend!

01:21:52.956 --> 01:21:55.925
The one place he knew we couldn't go into.

01:22:02.499 --> 01:22:04.228
You see something in here?

01:22:11.608 --> 01:22:15.704
-Did you find a bomb?
-Yeah, but not the one we're looking for.

01:22:16.647 --> 01:22:18.444
He's on to something. Where, boy?

01:22:18.515 --> 01:22:20.676
ls something in there, boy?

01:22:21.285 --> 01:22:22.650
Stand back.

01:22:25.756 --> 01:22:29.590
J-5, convert to bomb-disposal unit, now!

01:22:35.966 --> 01:22:37.627
l hope this works.

01:22:37.734 --> 01:22:41.101
He's only certified to handle
but so much explosives.

01:22:44.975 --> 01:22:47.910
Okay, Kevin, let's save Kimberly.

01:22:47.978 --> 01:22:50.776
J-5, to the street. Now.

01:22:54.351 --> 01:22:57.843
-Darryl, wait a minute.
-Please, call me Blankman.

01:22:58.355 --> 01:23:03.122
Blankman, do we have to tell Stone?
The building's not going to blow up, right?

01:23:03.193 --> 01:23:04.091
Look.

01:23:04.161 --> 01:23:07.062
l don't care what games you play,
little buddy.

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:12.033
-My only concern is Miss Kimberly Jonz.
-That's all l wanted to know.

01:23:13.637 --> 01:23:15.127
Hang on, my love.

01:23:16.773 --> 01:23:20.436
We can't find the bomb.

01:23:23.046 --> 01:23:25.037
-lt's gonna blow.
-Play along.

01:23:25.115 --> 01:23:29.643
lt's gonna blow. We can't find the bomb.
The whole thing's going to blow.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.984
What do you mean,
you can't find the bomb?

01:23:32.055 --> 01:23:35.616
l mean we can't find it. We messed up!

01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:38.989
The building's going to blow.
And when it does...

01:23:39.062 --> 01:23:42.054
...boom! Wheelchair here,
cowboy boot over there.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.195
Get me out of this thing! Come on!

01:23:45.269 --> 01:23:47.134
Blankman says there's no time.

01:23:47.204 --> 01:23:50.867
He says there's only time enough
to save baby girl.

01:23:52.876 --> 01:23:57.404
-You're going to leave me?
-He says you got to be strong. Be strong.

01:23:58.148 --> 01:24:00.639
You're just going to leave me here?

01:24:01.652 --> 01:24:05.247
l'll never forget you.
l'm gonna call your mama now!

01:24:06.557 --> 01:24:09.458
Get back here, you son of a bitch!
l'll kill you.

01:24:09.526 --> 01:24:12.552
l'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
l'll kick your ass.

01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:16.722
Other Guy, watch Kimberly.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.495
Get out of the way!

01:24:18.569 --> 01:24:20.867
Get out of the way! He's going to explode.

01:24:20.938 --> 01:24:24.101
He's going to explode! Get out!

01:24:31.114 --> 01:24:33.582
Good luck, buddy. Good luck.

01:24:44.027 --> 01:24:47.360
J-5, thank God you're all right, buddy.

01:24:56.974 --> 01:24:58.032
J-5!

01:24:58.108 --> 01:25:00.099
J-5, speak to me!

01:25:00.744 --> 01:25:02.735
Don't die, J-5.

01:25:03.113 --> 01:25:07.106
J-5, don't you dare die.

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:29.303
Minelli, you're going down!

01:25:31.808 --> 01:25:36.541
l'm Kimberly Jonz at the News Center.
What happened tonight is very simple.

01:25:36.713 --> 01:25:40.205
Blankman and some other guy in a mask,
they were abducted...

01:25:40.283 --> 01:25:44.049
...along with myself,
by Michael Minelli and his band of stooges.

01:25:44.121 --> 01:25:47.522
Luckily, when they fled,
Blankman outsmarted them.

01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:49.889
He got away. l don't believe it!

01:25:49.993 --> 01:25:53.190
You better believe it, you diabolical villain.

01:25:53.263 --> 01:25:55.197
Blankman, how did you find me?

01:25:55.265 --> 01:25:58.632
You'll have plenty of time
to figure that out, Minelli, in the joint!

01:25:58.702 --> 01:26:00.101
The joint?

01:26:01.038 --> 01:26:02.699
Sammy, shoot them.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.868
Come on, Sammy. You bad. Shoot me.

01:26:06.243 --> 01:26:08.609
-Shut up!
-l didn't tell you something.

01:26:08.679 --> 01:26:13.139
What, l got to paint a target on my ass?
Come on.

01:26:15.852 --> 01:26:17.285
My God, he shot me.

01:26:17.354 --> 01:26:21.290
l tried to tell you.
Only my costume's bulletproof.

01:26:24.494 --> 01:26:27.088
Okay, Minelli. The jig is up.

01:26:27.764 --> 01:26:30.358
lt's time for you to pay the piper.

01:26:30.434 --> 01:26:33.267
Get ready to rumble!

01:26:42.012 --> 01:26:44.310
My painting! Sammy, get him!

01:26:53.557 --> 01:26:54.888
Blankman!

01:26:56.493 --> 01:27:00.293
You brought the nunchakus.
Thanks, Other Guy.

01:27:25.956 --> 01:27:28.857
l've had all l can take from you, Blankman.

01:27:29.926 --> 01:27:30.984
Hi.

01:27:33.263 --> 01:27:34.287
Did l do that?

01:27:34.364 --> 01:27:38.824
lt doesn't matter, l'm gonna tear you apart
with my bare hands. Come here!

01:27:40.437 --> 01:27:41.768
-Get up.
-Damn it!

01:28:00.323 --> 01:28:01.312
Kevin!

01:28:01.758 --> 01:28:05.922
Blankman, it seems every time
we get together somebody dies.

01:28:07.497 --> 01:28:09.965
Say goodbye to Other Guy.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.592
Oh, yeah?

01:28:31.388 --> 01:28:33.856
All right! l give up!

01:28:33.924 --> 01:28:37.587
You should have thought about that
when you killed my grandmother!

01:28:55.178 --> 01:28:58.545
That's right, Minelli.
We got a nice, cold jail cell...

01:28:58.615 --> 01:29:02.051
...all warmed up for you.
You're not going anywhere.

01:29:02.118 --> 01:29:04.780
l'll see you in 20 years, Minelli.

01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:09.857
We did it, Other Guy!

01:29:09.926 --> 01:29:11.416
Blankman! Damn!

01:29:14.831 --> 01:29:19.291
Earlier today, thousands showed up
for a ticker-tape parade to honor...

01:29:19.369 --> 01:29:21.837
...its newest hero and his unnamed friend.

01:29:22.138 --> 01:29:25.801
Later, the Mayor addressed
the hearty crowd on the steps of city hall...

01:29:25.876 --> 01:29:28.436
...giving Blankman a special award.

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:30.604
l present you, Blankman...

01:29:31.047 --> 01:29:34.881
...the Harris Award
for outstanding community service.

01:29:35.986 --> 01:29:37.317
Thank you.

01:29:42.425 --> 01:29:44.916
And you, Other Guy...

01:29:45.528 --> 01:29:50.465
...this really cool Blankman T-shirt.
Let's hear it for these fine people.

01:29:50.533 --> 01:29:54.765
That was the scene a few hours ago
here at the administration building...

01:29:54.871 --> 01:29:59.205
...when a grateful city said thank you
to a man who has renewed its spirits.

01:29:59.276 --> 01:30:03.235
The crowds may have gone,
but the memory of this will last a lifetime.

01:30:03.313 --> 01:30:06.840
Live from city hall,
l'm Kimberly Jonz saying good night.

01:30:08.451 --> 01:30:10.749
Kevin, this is not such a great idea.

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:14.381
What if she doesn't like me?
What if she laughs right in my face?

01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:18.284
She's madly in love with you.
Why, l don't know.

01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:21.762
-She's in love with Blankman.
-Just tell her you're Blankman.

01:30:21.831 --> 01:30:24.026
And really break her heart!

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:27.900
We promised that we're supposed
to meet her after the parade.

01:30:27.971 --> 01:30:30.166
Now don't embarrass me. Go on.

01:30:33.543 --> 01:30:34.908
-Kimberly.
-Kevin.

01:30:34.978 --> 01:30:37.503
-This is my brother, Darryl.
-Darryl.

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:40.174
lt's nice to finally get to meet you.

01:30:40.317 --> 01:30:43.775
l can't get over this feeling
that l've met you before.

01:30:45.055 --> 01:30:48.354
So, l guess they had a big parade today
for that...

01:30:48.725 --> 01:30:50.955
...super-guy, what's his name?

01:30:51.027 --> 01:30:53.655
His name is Blankman. He saved my life.

01:30:54.297 --> 01:30:57.733
He's probably a big loser
without that flashy costume.

01:30:58.001 --> 01:31:00.128
He's definitely not a loser.

01:31:01.571 --> 01:31:03.334
-A purse-snatcher!
-Where?

01:31:03.406 --> 01:31:05.431
That's a job for Blankman!

01:31:07.577 --> 01:31:08.908
You know?

01:31:12.048 --> 01:31:15.108
Well, actually there's only one way
to be sure.

01:31:33.837 --> 01:31:36.806
What did you do to him?
Darryl, speak to me.

01:31:36.873 --> 01:31:39.171
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

01:31:40.305 --> 01:31:46.515
