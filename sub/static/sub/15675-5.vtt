WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:05.573
"London Boys" playing
in background

00:05.606 --> 00:07.708
- "Dodge 'Em."
- "Missile Command."

00:07.741 --> 00:10.611
- "Dig Dug."
- "Grand Prix," suckers.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.513
- Carl: Ah!
- Oh!

00:12.546 --> 00:15.283
Gordon, X to you.
Atari 2600 games.

00:15.316 --> 00:18.386
Has to start with
the last letter of
the previous answer.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.555
Uh, "Xenophobe."

00:21.589 --> 00:23.424
Whoa!

00:23.457 --> 00:26.427
Wait, wait, there's seriously
a game called "Xenophobe"?

00:26.460 --> 00:29.430
Yeah, but you're just being
intolerant to aliens,
so it's cool.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.832
All right, guys,
any updates on the bug

00:31.865 --> 00:33.734
we've been having with
the swap confirmations?

00:33.767 --> 00:35.336
Overhauled
and working great.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.305
That's it, ChernobylBoy
is going to the stocks.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.740
- Happy Fourth of July,
asswipe.
- Yeah.

00:39.773 --> 00:43.344
Some fifth grader reneged
on a swap for a "Close
Encounters" lunch pail.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.713
We're revoking
trading privileges
for repeat offenders.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.683
It's all internal for now,
but we're working on putting
this into here.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.252
Show him the guillotine.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.558
( laughs )

00:57.591 --> 00:59.327
But are you dead
in Mutiny?

00:59.360 --> 01:00.594
I mean, are we cancelling
people's subscriptions?

01:00.628 --> 01:02.696
You just wander around
without a head

01:02.730 --> 01:05.199
and that lets people know
this guy without a head
is a total dick.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.335
Don't swap with
this headless dickwad.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.203
( laughs )

01:09.237 --> 01:11.839
Can we get some
blood spurting out
of the neck hole?

01:11.872 --> 01:14.875
- God, how did we
not think of that?
- Put that in, dude! Yes.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.612
All right, we got to solve
for the Sev 1 cache miss bug

01:18.646 --> 01:20.148
in the out-of-region
swap routine?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.382
Tests today,
ships tomorrow.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.617
- You sure?
- Gordo, relax.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.220
SwapMeet's righteous.
The only thing
that's sideways

01:26.254 --> 01:29.357
is people keep ignoring
the no buying stuff rule.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.159
A lot of people
are trading for DBs.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.427
- DBs?
- Dollar bills.

01:33.461 --> 01:38.199
We could technically
monitor every trade to make
sure it doesn't happen.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.734
I can't help you there.
That's way above my pay grade.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.436
( laughs )

01:48.542 --> 01:49.877
So people are buying
shit for money.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.845
So what?
We knew this would happen.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.348
It's clunky.
Our users want an easy
way to buy things

01:54.382 --> 01:56.384
and they're frustrated
it doesn't exist.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.219
Our users want the Police
to get back together,

01:58.252 --> 01:59.520
but Sting's
not interested.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.255
Doug and Craig said
they can spend the weekend

02:01.289 --> 02:03.791
integrating their code
for credit card transactions.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.794
- No.
- They were already in beta with
it when we acquired them.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.429
It's basically
ready to go.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.464
Because they yanked it
off the shelf.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.566
It's boilerplate code
supplied by the credit
card company.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.268
They just gave it
a little shine job.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.337
We don't need
the perfect solution.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.272
If we have to temp
something in now

02:18.306 --> 02:19.940
and customize it
later, fine.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.410
A Band-Aid is better
than bleeding to death.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.512
Bleeding to death?

02:24.545 --> 02:27.515
Donna, SwapMeet
has doubled in size

02:27.548 --> 02:28.849
every week since
we went live.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.451
You're just scared
of slowing down.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.520
I don't want
to slow our growth.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.723
And you keep acting like
accepting credit cards

02:35.756 --> 02:38.292
is some devil's bargain.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.694
They make
people's lives easier.
That's the whole point.

02:40.728 --> 02:44.365
Okay, Mutiny is a castle.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.535
You and I built it
and then we gave a little
piece to Diane.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.538
And then a little piece
to freakin' Doug and Craig.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.941
But making deals with
credit card companies is
just lowering the drawbridge.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.845
What good is a castle
if nobody's in the kingdom?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.914
It doubles in size
every week, okay?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.850
There is a fix for this,
I promise.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.652
I just-- I don't know
what it is yet.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.654
- Hey, Cam,
are you down there?
- Yeah, Bos.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.423
Cam, I'm gonna pick you up
tomorrow at 6:00 A.M.
sharp, all right?

03:09.457 --> 03:11.959
We got to get
to the terminal
a little bit early.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.562
They always give me shit
about the rods in my tailbone.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.397
Okay.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.238
When we moved
here, we knew
that there'd be times

03:24.272 --> 03:26.707
that we'd have
to adapt quickly.
This is one of those times.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.910
Donna, we're all
alone, okay?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.879
There's no other company
that's even attempting

03:31.912 --> 03:33.881
to do what SwapMeet
is doing.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.584
I don't want to rush in
and just screw it up
all at once.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.486
Can we talk about it
when I get back Monday?

03:38.519 --> 03:40.288
- We're not gonna
screw anything--
- Monday.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.762
Have a nice trip.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.631
Stanford's over here
right next to Moffett.

03:50.664 --> 03:54.034
Over here
is jackboot central.
DoD, NORAD, the NSA.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.570
And I printed out all
the directories for every
mainframe on the network.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.340
And we can leverage
some of the weak access
points I found.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.775
Now, the Pentagon
is nearly impenetrable,

04:01.809 --> 04:02.943
but some
of these other guys--

04:02.976 --> 04:04.745
Utah is a total sieve.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.046
What is this right here?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.382
That's not really
part of ARPANET.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.918
That's just the new network
the National Science Foundation
just rolled out.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.654
Yeah, NSFNET.
Steve Wolff's baby.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.955
I went in through
Cornell's node.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.925
It's only been live
for a couple days.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.295
Could you--
could you not do that?

04:21.329 --> 04:23.397
NSFNET's
transmission lines

04:23.431 --> 04:25.466
are 10 times faster
than ARPANET theoretically.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.701
- Uh-huh.
- But it keeps crashing.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.404
- I've been bumped off six
times in less than an hour.
- What else?

04:30.438 --> 04:33.807
Seriously, Joe,
it's just a bunch
of tenure-track slapdicks.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.810
They can't even get their
basic infrastructure right.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.413
They got grants
for the national network,

04:39.447 --> 04:41.549
threw a bunch of cash
at the local level,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.784
and left the regional networks
in the middle hanging.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.955
- So?
- So there's a huge
bottleneck baked in.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.923
There's no room
for increased demand.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.960
- So like ARPANET--
- Commercial use is banned.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.829
There could be
something here.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.631
It's a lemon.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.634
I've been working on it
for six weeks, I know.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.336
Well, you know.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.739
You've been working
on it for six weeks.

05:05.773 --> 05:09.042
General Atomics left
a hole in our balance
sheet $3 million deep.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.979
We're hemorrhaging money.
ARPANET will be
mothballed soon.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.947
And NSFNET is the future.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.916
That's the story
you just told me.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.453
No, Joe.
Listen--

05:19.487 --> 05:22.423
Just dig deeper
on this.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.091
Indulge me.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.093
- That's all for today.
- ( knock on door )

05:26.126 --> 05:28.962
Get some sleep, Ryan.
You're starting
to miss things.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.008
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.110
- It's not a good time.
- Now.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.480
Thank you for today.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.357
( theme music playing )

06:26.620 --> 06:29.122
"Green Ideas" playing

06:29.156 --> 06:31.058
Bosworth:
I'm just so excited
to see this little monkey,

06:31.091 --> 06:33.827
I whizzed right past
Sonny Bryan's.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.896
Hey, when do babies
start talking?

06:35.929 --> 06:38.532
Um, three or four months?

06:38.566 --> 06:42.102
His first words are gonna be
barbecue if I got anything
to say about it.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.104
Oh, hey, check this out.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.874
Remember that stewardess,
the one with the legs?

06:49.076 --> 06:51.178
She gave me that for Sam.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.814
Every time I'd go on a trip
when James was young,

06:53.847 --> 06:55.816
I'd get one of these,
pin it to his teddy bear

06:55.849 --> 06:57.818
first thing in the morning
so he'd know I was home.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.788
That's really sweet, Bos.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.523
So what's the plan?
You gonna ship the bike

07:02.556 --> 07:04.458
or are you gonna ride off
into the sunset,

07:04.492 --> 07:06.827
catch bugs in your teeth
on the way back to the Bay?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.996
You know, I don't even
know if it runs.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.699
I'm kind of playing
this all by ear.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.467
Well, they know
you're back, don't they?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.135
No.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.972
I'm not gonna give
my mom time to work up
some stupid speech.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.208
You'll be glad
you did this.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.179
You're doing
all right, Cam.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.590
I am so sorry.
I thought Linda
would never leave.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.259
She was supposed
to pick up the kids
first thing in the morning.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.629
For her,
this is first thing.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.598
She was telling me about
this creepy dad at school

07:44.632 --> 07:47.200
that keeps asking her
to go boogie boarding
in Capitola.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.269
I think she wants me
to be jealous.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.038
Oh, I am not
drinking out of that.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.206
Hey, look at this.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.710
Remember that bar
we went to

07:56.744 --> 07:58.779
in Independence on our way
to Onion Valley?

07:58.812 --> 08:01.815
The bartender got us
so drunk, we had to sleep
in the car.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.784
Oh, yeah.
( laughs )

08:06.887 --> 08:08.088
Hey, where are
the propane canisters?

08:09.590 --> 08:11.592
I forgot.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.528
But we can go
stop by Orchard Supply
on the way out.

08:14.562 --> 08:18.599
Orchard Supply is not
open on the Fourth.

08:18.632 --> 08:22.169
You know, and this stupid
thing is useless.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.271
Hey, I don't mind sleeping
out under the stars.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.274
Yeah, that's what
the rattlesnakes
want you to do.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.076
( sighs )

08:29.109 --> 08:31.645
You know, what's the point
of even going?

08:31.679 --> 08:33.714
You know,
nothing's working.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.883
Well, the kids are gone

08:35.916 --> 08:39.787
and we haven't
had one night alone
since we got to California.

08:39.820 --> 08:44.024
We could always, you know,
have a vacation at home.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.827
You know what?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.161
We're staying here.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.698
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.833
I'm gonna defrost
the porterhouses.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.568
You can pull out
that lacy thing

08:54.602 --> 08:56.136
with the straps
that I got you
for Easter.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.740
I am changing
into sweatpants.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.076
Or sweatpants.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.278
Look at this.
We got the same hair.
You see?

09:05.312 --> 09:07.581
- You want to hold him?
- Cameron: No, no, no, Bos.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.217
- No, my taxi's coming.
- Hold the baby.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.052
Hold the baby,
Cameron.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.154
Yeah.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.990
Lisa:
Are you sure we can't convince
you to stay, Cameron?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.726
I see the crib got
here in one piece.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.193
Uh, yeah, in a lot
of pieces, actually.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.095
Gonna put it together
this weekend.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.931
Lisa:
Sam's graduating out
of his bassinet.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.734
Bosworth: Already?
Precocious little fella.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.368
Look at him.
Oh, I almost forgot.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.971
Do you remember
when I used to get
these for you?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.840
- Yeah, sure do.
- ( car horn honks )

09:32.873 --> 09:34.808
Oh, that's me.
Okay.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.710
Bosworth:
All right, see you
first thing bright and early.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.079
Congratulations.
Your baby's really cool.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.181
I got to get going, too.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.116
I can't believe
they're making you
work on the Fourth.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.918
Yeah, well,
mouths to feed.
Work's work.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.054
Oh, I know
that kind of work.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.390
- I'll be back soon.
Just got to kiss the ring.
- All right.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.893
Do you want
to talk to Grampy?
Come talk to Grampy.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.335
( sighs )

10:26.293 --> 10:29.296
It's, uh--
it's the Fourth of July.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.232
Right.
I mean, you didn't say
I had the day off, so...

10:32.265 --> 10:34.367
Ryan, it's
the Fourth of July.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.637
So, do you want
me to leave?

10:43.110 --> 10:45.045
No.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.114
No, come on in.

11:04.832 --> 11:05.999
Coffee?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.969
Sure.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.340
Kill the computer.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.208
( computer beeps )

11:17.510 --> 11:19.479
You take it black,
right?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.816
Cream, lots of sugar,
actually.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.321
- ( truck horn blows )
- ( tone beeps )

11:28.355 --> 11:31.324
Oh, hi, it's me.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.994
I'm here in Dallas.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.229
Um...

11:36.263 --> 11:40.067
yeah, I'm staying
at the Motel 6 on...

11:42.135 --> 11:43.503
I actually
don't know where.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.505
There's a Midas
and a Whataburger.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.009
But, uh, okay.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.079
I'm here.

12:03.456 --> 12:07.494
"Nowhere Girl"
playing in background

12:07.527 --> 12:10.363
All right, steaks
will be ready in a few.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.232
Mmm.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.236
( sighs )

12:21.041 --> 12:22.910
God.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.945
Unreal.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.914
Do you hear that?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.415
No.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.050
Exactly.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.420
No modems screeching
like a dying hamster.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.289
God, she can be
so stubborn.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.859
And, you know, you wouldn't
think somebody so punk

12:38.892 --> 12:42.129
would be so conservative
when it comes to business.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.866
Yeah, I was really just
talking about the modem.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.268
But, sure, I get it.
It's stressful.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.170
But Cameron's been great
for the most part.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.039
You know,
the kids love her.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.141
Of course, I guess
that's a mixed bag.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.309
I mean, she makes
you better, right?

12:56.343 --> 13:00.447
You know what?
I really don't want
to talk about work.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.315
I wasn't talking
about work.

13:02.349 --> 13:06.153
Oh, well, I really
don't want to talk
about Cameron.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.554
Oh.

13:10.590 --> 13:14.561
Well, what do you want
to talk about?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.329
I don't really want
to talk at all.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.198
"Crazy Jenny"
playing in background

13:22.335 --> 13:24.271
( laughs )

13:28.541 --> 13:31.544
And then we acquired
this company, which was insane

13:31.578 --> 13:33.480
because our payroll
doubled, like, overnight.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.116
Which is fine because
that's what people say
you have to do

13:36.149 --> 13:38.852
to be competitive
in Silicon Valley,
so that's what we did.

13:38.886 --> 13:42.089
Uh, but, yeah, so the thing
that we acquired,

13:42.122 --> 13:43.857
it's called SwapMeet
and it started off--

13:43.891 --> 13:45.926
I know about SwapMeet.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.561
It's pretty hard to miss
'cause I'm still a subscriber.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.132
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.234
I actually almost pulled
the trigger on a swap

13:54.267 --> 13:56.503
for this
"Centipede" cabinet,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.472
but the shipping
from Winnipeg
was ridiculous.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.610
Can I refill
for y'all?

14:03.643 --> 14:06.113
I'm-- I'm okay,
but if you...

14:06.146 --> 14:07.480
Just the check.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.290
Hey, I'm really sorry
that I didn't reach out.

14:17.324 --> 14:22.229
I wanted to write,
but I'm--

14:22.262 --> 14:23.663
I'm not very good
with words

14:23.696 --> 14:26.066
unless it's, like,
part of a chunk of code.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.068
And honestly, I wasn't sure
if you wanted to hear from me.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.573
- It was good
to get your call.
- Yeah.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.442
I mean, I didn't come
just to see you.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.111
I came to grab
some stuff from my mom.

14:41.048 --> 14:45.218
Well, you're gonna see her.
That's-- that's great, right?

14:45.252 --> 14:47.220
Yeah, I mean,
she and Len are moving,

14:47.254 --> 14:51.158
so just got to get
what I came here for

14:51.191 --> 14:53.126
and then get
the hell out.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.962
I don't know,
she just--

14:54.995 --> 14:57.564
if I had my way,
I wouldn't have to
see her at all, but...

14:57.597 --> 14:59.399
I'm really happy
to see you.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.368
Don't.
Come on.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.139
I mean, you--

15:09.209 --> 15:11.578
here, why don't
you get this

15:11.611 --> 15:16.049
and start working off
that plane ticket that
you never used.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.251
I'm kidding.
It's just a joke.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.121
I'll get it.
It's like a $3
business expense.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.589
I can write it off.
It's fine.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.557
Yeah, okay.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.559
Thanks.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.136
They quit for the holiday
before they finished
the new one.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.706
But what do you think?

15:39.739 --> 15:41.741
What's replacing me?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.477
Ryan:
Denture cream.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.446
The lottery.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.348
This city.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.518
I can't decide
if it's beautiful
or horrifying.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.322
My mom came out here.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.726
She died here.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.631
Nothing lasts
in this place.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.466
The whole city
burned down seven times

16:06.499 --> 16:09.302
in the first couple years
of its existence.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.405
Even its name
has been reinvented.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.474
You know what San Francisco
used to be called?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.509
Yeah, Yerba Buena.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.647
Look, that's what makes
this city so great.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.350
You can screw up,
you can fail,

16:23.383 --> 16:25.385
and so what?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.287
You get another chance.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.090
- It's disposable.
- It's exciting.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.559
'Cause you never know
what the hell's next.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.394
Denture cream.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.163
( chuckles )

16:36.196 --> 16:39.332
I'm not sure I've got
another next in me.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.470
You should know that.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.774
"Train in Vain" playing

16:57.184 --> 17:00.820
* You say you stand
by your man *

17:00.853 --> 17:04.424
* Tell me something
I don't understand... *

17:04.457 --> 17:08.695
Oh, my God.
I haven't heard
this song in years.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.831
Was that totally
hot sex worth burning
the steaks or what?

17:11.864 --> 17:14.634
Oh, God,
a billion times yes.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.473
To the best
vacation ever.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.442
* Did you stand by me

17:22.475 --> 17:24.111
* No, not at all...

17:24.144 --> 17:26.846
- ( laughs )
- * Did you stand by me

17:26.879 --> 17:28.615
* No way

17:28.648 --> 17:30.450
* All the times

17:30.483 --> 17:32.552
* When we were close

17:32.585 --> 17:34.454
* I'll remember

17:34.487 --> 17:36.389
* These things the most

17:36.423 --> 17:40.260
* I see all my dreams
come tumbling down *

17:40.293 --> 17:42.262
* I can't be happy

17:42.295 --> 17:44.397
* Without you around...

17:44.431 --> 17:46.399
I love you.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.836
I love, too.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.871
* There's only one
thing I can say *

17:51.904 --> 17:54.107
* You didn't stand by me

17:54.141 --> 17:56.776
* No, not at all,
did you stand by me... *

17:56.809 --> 18:00.413
True fact-- a banana peel
will shine your shoes
like no other.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.883
Saved me a mint
in my 20s.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.752
Yeah, I think I've read
that somewhere.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.455
Oh, you did, huh?
Oh, there he is.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.223
Hey.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.292
( car door closes )

18:14.394 --> 18:16.496
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.698
I got a little--

18:18.731 --> 18:20.833
got ribs
and hoecake for you.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.802
Um, yeah.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.238
And, oh, there's some--

18:25.272 --> 18:28.775
you know, there's some
fireworks going on out there
that are pretty incredible.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.278
Shh, shh.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.413
Lisa:
He's in the nursery.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.483
Your dad built the crib.
He's been a huge help.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.518
Even went out
for some diapers.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.655
No, no, no.
I was gonna build
that crib.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.724
Sam will be up
in a couple hours.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.393
I'm going to bed.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.264
Well, I think
we could all use
some sleep.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.434
Yeah. Yeah, okay,
Mr. Family Man.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.937
Nobody's blaming you
for being gone, James.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.807
Well, maybe I should
have brought home some
pilot wings, huh?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.542
Maybe that would
make up for it.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.477
You loved those
when you were a kid.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.513
Hell, you had
a whole box of them.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.416
Yeah, I had a whole box
of them because Mom
was a stewardess.

19:09.449 --> 19:13.286
I just tossed the ones
you gave me on top.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.589
You can rewrite
history to impress
your 15-year-old boss,

19:16.623 --> 19:18.325
but you don't fool me.

19:28.635 --> 19:32.405
Hey, what's that place
we used to go eat at

19:32.439 --> 19:34.307
down in the South Bay?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.476
Oh, Los Gatos Cafe.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.246
- Yeah.
- Those eggs Benedict.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.550
I'm taking you there
tomorrow for brunch.

19:43.583 --> 19:47.254
One last hurrah before
the crazies return.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.722
Well, we definitely
worked up an appetite.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.326
God, twice in one day.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.328
We should do that
more often.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.564
Twice in one week
is above average.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.799
We have not had sex

19:59.832 --> 20:02.302
twice in one day
since Gerald Ford
was in the office.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.737
- No, that's not true.
- It's totally true.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.840
Pre-kid.
Do the math.
Carry the one.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.410
Ford.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.945
Oh, my God.
We really needed this.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.783
I'm so glad
we didn't go camping.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.685
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.853
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.756
Yeah?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.925
I mean,
we're not as young
as we used to be.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.894
Yeah.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.962
But, you know,
even then

20:29.996 --> 20:32.465
popping a squat
behind a tree

20:32.499 --> 20:34.934
and your back kills
when you wake up.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.704
No, thank you.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.773
Yeah, but...

20:40.807 --> 20:43.443
you loved
all those times
at Mt. Tam.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.877
Eh.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.279
What?

20:46.313 --> 20:48.781
Yosemite was
freaking awesome.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.983
You know what it is?

20:51.017 --> 20:55.054
It's like that saying
about what crazy is.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.056
That you do the same thing
a ton of times

20:57.089 --> 21:00.527
and you're like,
"This always sucks."

21:00.560 --> 21:02.295
That's insanity.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.734
It's doing the same thing
over and over and expecting
a different result.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.571
Yeah. Yes.
Camping is insanity.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.706
( laughs )

21:15.808 --> 21:18.811
Oh, God.
I am exhausted.

21:18.845 --> 21:22.014
( yawns )

21:37.697 --> 21:39.332
( whistling )

21:39.366 --> 21:41.601
- ( exploding )
- ( cheering )

21:41.634 --> 21:44.070
That was cool.
Come on, let's go
light another one.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.373
I got more back
at my place.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.537
( distant fireworks
exploding )

22:33.653 --> 22:34.821
( sloshing )

23:05.885 --> 23:06.453
( car horns honking )

23:36.583 --> 23:39.118
( Joe sobbing )

23:54.534 --> 23:57.003
Woman:
Hey, how much
for this jacket?

23:57.036 --> 23:59.839
Bosworth: Look, if you're not
gonna eat the rest of the
thing, then I want it.

23:59.872 --> 24:03.142
You know how hard it is to get
a halfway decent breakfast
burrito in the Bay Area?

24:03.175 --> 24:06.245
It's a fool's errand.
Thank you.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.549
It's funny.
It's not where I pictured
you growing up.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.117
I didn't.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.685
No?

24:12.719 --> 24:14.721
Oh, that hombre's back.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.923
He brought cash with him.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.063
You gonna do
what you came here
for or what?

24:24.096 --> 24:26.032
Shh, don't.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.568
Cameron, I know
the first 2,000 miles
are easy

24:28.601 --> 24:30.002
and the last 20 feet
are hard,

24:30.036 --> 24:32.905
but you've come all this way
and now here we are.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.507
Okay.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.576
You owe this
to yourself.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.077
And to them.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.985
Come--

24:46.018 --> 24:47.854
he's buying
your dad's bike,
Cameron.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.623
Fine. Just stop
talking, okay?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.091
That's yours.
Go get it.
Go get it.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.293
Stop it!
What the hell
are you doing?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.062
People don't make
mistakes because they
don't love you, Cameron.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.830
They make mistakes
because they do.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.066
Oh, that is such
a crock of shit
even from you.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.001
You want me to pick up
the slack for you again?

25:02.034 --> 25:04.036
Great, why should today
be any different, huh?

25:04.070 --> 25:06.072
Would you stop?

25:06.105 --> 25:08.007
Cameron, you didn't
come here just for the bike.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.209
- Come on, now.
- Jesus Christ!

25:10.242 --> 25:14.180
Listen, you might
think you're my father,
but you're not, okay?

25:14.213 --> 25:15.982
I know that,
God damn it.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.784
No, no, I don't
think you do.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.852
( motor running )

25:40.139 --> 25:42.308
( engine starts )

25:43.843 --> 25:45.645
( tires squeal )

26:39.899 --> 26:43.035
Oh, wow.

26:43.069 --> 26:46.138
Oh, hey.
Thought I'd get
a jump-start on the day.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.007
Great.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.678
So Los Gatos Cafe?

26:51.711 --> 26:54.146
I'm really jonesing
for that eggs Benedict.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.215
Yeah.

26:56.248 --> 27:00.086
I don't know.
The kids will
be home soon.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.688
Rain check?

27:04.256 --> 27:06.158
Everything all right?

27:06.192 --> 27:07.794
Yeah.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.328
Everything's fantastic.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.271
I'm gonna go
work on the ham
if it's all the same.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.307
Oh.

27:21.340 --> 27:25.011
You know, get some
good ham time in.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.079
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

27:27.113 --> 27:30.116
There's some leftover
pizza in the fridge
if you want some.

28:24.203 --> 28:24.570
( phone rings )

28:36.849 --> 28:39.251
( knocks )
Any word from
the boss man?

28:39.285 --> 28:41.053
She even coming in?
It's already noon.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.755
We're ready
to move ahead.
Just say the word.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.256
I have to talk
to her first.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.025
There's a petition up
right now on Community.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.927
It's called 1986 BC.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.896
It demands we let users
pay with actual money.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.397
Hundreds of people
have already signed.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.532
- It was posted
two hours ago.
- Okay, guys.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.968
One user just emailed me
thanking Mutiny
for reviving

28:56.002 --> 28:58.871
the "efficiency
and modernity of
the barter system."

28:58.905 --> 29:00.940
- Doug:
He signed it Methuselah.
- ( door closes )

29:02.474 --> 29:04.110
Donna:
Just wait, okay?

29:04.143 --> 29:06.478
My answer is the same
as it was an hour ago.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.214
Take a knee
or whatever.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.460
( knocks )

29:21.493 --> 29:23.295
How was Texas?

29:23.329 --> 29:25.431
Still big.
How was camp?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.533
- Didn't go.
- Peaches.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.569
Was the plane delayed?

29:30.602 --> 29:34.040
Got into San Jo'
8:00 A.M. right on time.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.408
I just needed a morning,
so I took it.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.244
Okay.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.446
Look, I don't know
where she is, Donna.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.181
She didn't even get
on the damn plane.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.916
You left her
in Texas?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.918
I'm not
her keeper, Donna.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.887
And you have no idea
where she is?

29:47.920 --> 29:50.589
Kid was at a Motel 6
on I-30.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.559
Beyond that, like I said,

29:53.592 --> 29:55.427
it's one big-ass state.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.595
( sighs )

29:58.931 --> 30:00.066
"Walking Out on Love"
playing in background

30:00.099 --> 30:01.233
"Night Princess."

30:01.267 --> 30:02.935
"Spy Hunter."

30:02.969 --> 30:05.004
- "Root Beer Tapper."
- What?

30:05.037 --> 30:08.007
Gordo,
ColecoVision games.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.242
Hey, stupid Gordon,
your stupid turn.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.044
R to you.

30:12.078 --> 30:15.114
- Pass.
- ( imitates buzzer )

30:15.147 --> 30:16.983
Gordo's in a mood.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.588
Hey, Donna.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.957
The guy at the Motel 6
said she checked out.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.362
How long will it take?

30:30.396 --> 30:32.999
We can start beta tests
internally today.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.300
Be live in under a week.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.102
Okay, then do it.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.569
And Cameron's okay
with that?

30:37.603 --> 30:40.306
Cameron's not here.
She'll catch up.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.645
Ryan: Joe, check this out.
Something weird going on
near Ithaca.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.981
Found some code fragments
with the same fingerprint

30:49.015 --> 30:52.151
as IBM, Kodak, Xerox.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.886
Hey, Joe?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.521
Yeah.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.257
You okay?

30:58.290 --> 31:01.393
Okay, I don't know exactly
what we're looking at here,

31:01.427 --> 31:04.263
but the slapdicks
have given way to
the big swinging variety

31:04.296 --> 31:06.532
and they're working
on something together

31:06.565 --> 31:08.400
called NYSERNET.

31:08.434 --> 31:09.601
That's interesting.

31:09.635 --> 31:12.104
Interesting, yeah,

31:12.138 --> 31:15.074
but it doesn't do much
to fill the money hole
you're so worried about.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.243
God, you're doing
great work here.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.213
( phone rings )

31:23.715 --> 31:25.985
Hello?

31:26.018 --> 31:28.254
- Woman: May I speak
with Joe MacMillan?
- This is he.

31:28.287 --> 31:31.390
Mr. MacMillan,
I'm calling from
the San Francisco City Clinic.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.559
Is this a good time
to discuss your recent visit?

31:33.592 --> 31:36.228
Hold on one second.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.529
We're done for the day.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.309
I'm ready.

31:50.342 --> 31:54.180
Mr. MacMillan,
I have the results
of your HIV antibody test.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.115
Since you were
in contact...

31:56.148 --> 31:58.084
"New Misery" playing

32:58.777 --> 32:59.711
"Ammunition" playing
in background

33:08.787 --> 33:13.159
- ( phone rings )
- Hello.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.261
New user sign-ups
saw a welcome spike

33:15.294 --> 33:16.662
after we integrated
SwapMeet,

33:16.695 --> 33:19.265
but we're fielding
too many complaints

33:19.298 --> 33:22.801
about the lack
of support for our
monetary transactions.

33:22.834 --> 33:27.173
So tonight we will go live
with the credit card code

33:27.206 --> 33:29.475
that Doug and Craig
have been testing all week.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.715
Man:
Look who it is.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.451
It's Cameron.
Cameron's back.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.158
Donna:
When users purchase
something,

33:46.192 --> 33:50.162
we charge them
for the item and we add
a small transaction fee.

33:50.196 --> 33:53.565
Mail checks to sellers
for the sales price--

33:58.270 --> 34:00.172
What's this?

34:00.206 --> 34:03.309
Well, first of all,
welcome back.

34:03.342 --> 34:06.312
I think I speak
for all of us when I say
I'm glad you're okay.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.414
I've been working.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.449
We've all been working.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.285
Cameron:
I can see that.

34:13.319 --> 34:18.757
I have a solve
for transactions.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.493
We've been in beta
on a credit card interface
all week.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.529
Doug and Craig's code?

34:23.562 --> 34:25.231
Yeah, it works great.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.300
Okay, so you just went ahead
and did that without me.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.569
Could you all excuse us?

34:30.602 --> 34:32.070
Cameron and I need
the room, please.

34:42.614 --> 34:46.118
Hey, so let me see
if I've got this.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.887
So let's say
I want to buy a,

34:48.920 --> 34:53.559
I don't know,
first Superman comic
for $100.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.496
Mutiny charges my AmEx,
adds five bucks.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.398
As a transaction fee.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.767
But AmEx takes
three of those dollars
as their transaction fee,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.535
so Mutiny is only making
two bucks.

35:03.569 --> 35:06.305
Meanwhile, I'm really
pissed because yesterday

35:06.338 --> 35:09.175
I could have shelled out
100 DBs for that Superman

35:09.208 --> 35:11.643
and today I'm shelling
out an extra five bucks
for nothing.

35:11.677 --> 35:14.513
It's not nothing.
We're providing
a valuable service.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.416
Oh, spoken like
a true middleman.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.586
Okay, so what's
your solution?

35:22.454 --> 35:24.423
Routing numbers.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.558
It's how banks
move money.

35:26.592 --> 35:29.728
And our subscribers pay
by checks, so their account
numbers are already on file.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.266
Okay, you sell me Superman.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.535
Mutiny pulls funds
directly from my bank

35:36.568 --> 35:38.404
and deposits them
into your account

35:38.437 --> 35:40.706
using our own
ABA routing number
as a pipeline.

35:40.739 --> 35:44.743
Oh, and it's basically free
because we don't incur
a transaction fee

35:44.776 --> 35:47.546
and we don't charge one
either because our expenses
haven't skyrocketed.

35:47.579 --> 35:51.217
But then with your way,
we'd need, what,

35:51.250 --> 35:54.453
three people handling
credit card transactions,

35:54.486 --> 35:57.323
a few people to handle
check writing and mailing,

35:57.356 --> 35:59.325
probably an accountant
or two.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.428
So that's, what,
12 new hires?

36:02.461 --> 36:03.862
Yeah, that's about right.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.498
Okay, my way adds
one person.

36:06.532 --> 36:07.899
One.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.736
I can't believe you.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.438
Right back at you.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.706
We agreed to discuss this
when I got back.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.842
We agreed to discuss
this on Monday.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.744
It's Friday.
Where have you been?

36:18.777 --> 36:21.313
Who cares?
I'm here now.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.350
Since when do you make
decisions for my company
without consulting me?

36:24.383 --> 36:27.286
God damn it,
I tried to consult you
and I couldn't find you.

36:27.319 --> 36:30.489
Oh, my God,
this is exactly what
I've been worried about.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.692
- What?
- Every new person that walks
through that door,

36:33.725 --> 36:36.995
another piece of Mutiny
gets cut away from me.

36:37.028 --> 36:41.433
No, no, no, Donna.
Mutiny isn't just my job,
it's who I am.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.868
It's who I am, too.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.703
I couldn't sleep all week.

36:44.736 --> 36:48.340
I could ignore the mountain
of complaints in my in-box,

36:48.374 --> 36:49.741
but I care too much.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.444
I came up with
a better solution.

36:52.478 --> 36:55.681
Just because you think
you need to sprinkle
your fairy dust

36:55.714 --> 36:59.285
over everything around here
before you feel satisfied
doesn't mean it's better.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.953
No, it is better.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.789
Oh, God.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.892
Okay, but that's
not the point.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.361
We were in real trouble.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.797
And when I'm in trouble
and I look around,

37:11.830 --> 37:14.500
I need to find you there.

37:14.533 --> 37:19.471
We need to have
each other's backs.

37:19.505 --> 37:24.009
Sometimes I need
to crawl into a hole
just find my head.

37:24.042 --> 37:27.713
I know you're patient with me
even when I drag my feet.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.916
I know I should find
my own place to live

37:30.949 --> 37:32.984
and stop imposing
on you guys.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.356
And I know that--

37:37.389 --> 37:40.692
that dinner with Doug
and Craig that I missed

37:40.726 --> 37:42.561
that you probably didn't
think we should fire them,

37:42.594 --> 37:45.931
but you went to bat for me
anyways with Diane.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.866
I know that.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.540
I was with Tom, okay?
That's where I was.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.378
Yeah, I was wondering.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.749
Still, you should
have called.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.855
He said that you're
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.723
And it's true.

38:11.757 --> 38:15.060
And not 'cause he said it
or anything, just--

38:18.830 --> 38:20.766
you anchor me.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.747
So I guess
we're like a bank now.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.649
That's pretty
cool, huh?

38:39.618 --> 38:41.720
( chuckles )
It's a routing number.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.855
We're not giving away
free toasters or anything.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.628
I do have
your back, Donna.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.500
I have a weird way
of showing it,

38:54.533 --> 38:56.435
but I swear I do.

38:58.904 --> 39:01.072
I have yours.

39:40.946 --> 39:44.583
This and only this
is what we focus on.

39:44.616 --> 39:48.987
Okay, yeah, time-out.
This is super cool to me,
but only NSFNET?

39:49.020 --> 39:51.757
The yarn you just pulled,
those are the deep pockets.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.559
Exactly.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.193
It's virgin territory.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.763
Wolff created
a bottleneck, right?

39:57.796 --> 39:59.831
Yeah, no support
for regional networks.
The guy is insane.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.601
The guy is brilliant.
He's sending a signal.

40:02.634 --> 40:06.037
He's like our Gorbachev.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.839
Do you know
what Glasnost is?

40:07.873 --> 40:11.009
I want to say either
a vodka or a satellite.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.078
Wolff knows
that the only way
his network will grow

40:13.111 --> 40:15.213
is if private money
gets in the game.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.917
The problem is
that's against the law
for now.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.887
- But...
- But maybe one day
it won't be.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.556
And when the rules change,
people are going to flood in.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.559
Average people at home
on their Apple IIe and Amiga

40:27.593 --> 40:29.227
and it's gonna overload
the system.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.696
So who breaks
the bottleneck?

40:30.729 --> 40:33.565
We are going to create

40:33.599 --> 40:37.202
a regional network
right there.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.472
The past--
the past is a bunch
of fortresses

40:40.506 --> 40:42.841
all closed off
from the rest
of the world.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.143
We don't have to build
a faster computer

40:45.176 --> 40:47.579
or dream up the next
killer application.

40:47.613 --> 40:50.482
That's what you do
in a fortress.

40:50.516 --> 40:55.721
We are going to pave
a road between them.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.756
And you're going
to ask the board to go
deeper in the hole

40:57.789 --> 40:59.257
on something that may
never turn a dime?

40:59.290 --> 41:01.092
I don't care what
the board thinks anymore.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.994
Money is just
a side effect.

41:03.028 --> 41:04.730
Glasnost.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.865
It means openness.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.935
And it's always a bad idea
to bet against openness.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.872
- Are you hungry?
- I don't know, Joe.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.273
You don't know
if you're hungry?

41:15.306 --> 41:16.908
I don't even know
what to think anymore.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.910
I try to decipher
your sayings,

41:18.944 --> 41:21.212
but then the phone
rings and you boot me
to another zip code.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.114
And we still
haven't figured out
how to make any money

41:23.148 --> 41:26.017
and I go home every day
and I'm spinning

41:26.051 --> 41:28.854
and I don't even know
if you like me.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.255
I feel crazy.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.526
You're not going
crazy, Ryan.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.261
You're hungry.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.129
Look, I've had
a tough week.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.265
Will you join me
for dinner?

41:43.802 --> 41:45.837
Okay.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.574
Okay, I'll come
to dinner with you.

41:48.607 --> 41:49.975
Sounds nice.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.645
Just take a good look.

41:53.679 --> 41:56.582
That's what's next.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.795
( phone rings )

42:09.828 --> 42:11.597
Diane Gould.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.231
Diane, hi.
It's Cameron Howe.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.567
Cameron.
What's going on?

42:15.601 --> 42:18.103
I had a talk with Donna
earlier today

42:18.136 --> 42:20.071
and I wanted to call

42:20.105 --> 42:24.342
and say I know I've been
a little eccentric lately.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.713
Someone once told me
that eccentric

42:27.746 --> 42:29.981
is just a fancy word
for asshole.

42:30.015 --> 42:32.350
I'm a little eccentric
myself.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.587
And you have to be
if you want to make it
as a woman in this business.

42:35.621 --> 42:37.823
This routing number thing
is really great.

42:37.856 --> 42:41.960
Yeah, okay, I also
just wanted to call

42:41.993 --> 42:45.196
and say thanks for,
you know,

42:45.230 --> 42:48.967
seeing that Mutiny Exchange
wasn't something we could do
on our own

42:49.000 --> 42:52.270
and that it was smart
to buy SwapMeet.

42:52.303 --> 42:55.040
And, yes, I don't love
Doug and Craig,

42:55.073 --> 42:59.110
but I really totally respect
your decision to keep them
at the company.

42:59.144 --> 43:00.979
Like I told Donna,

43:01.012 --> 43:03.715
I'd have paid
for them to go away.
Cost of doing business.

43:03.749 --> 43:06.317
But it shows strength
that you decided
to make it work.

43:06.351 --> 43:09.688
Look,
this call is appreciated,
but it's unnecessary.

43:09.721 --> 43:13.158
It's your company.
You don't have to apologize
for any decision.

43:13.191 --> 43:15.593
In the end,
you decide.

43:17.062 --> 43:18.196
Cameron?

43:18.229 --> 43:20.699
Uh, yeah.
Okay, thanks, Diane.

43:20.732 --> 43:22.801
I've got to go.
Bye.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.115
( door opens )

43:37.148 --> 43:39.785
( indistinct chatter )

43:39.818 --> 43:42.220
( breathing heavily )

44:56.094 --> 44:59.097
( music playing )
