WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.553 --> 00:13.471
<i>Seven to ten, alone again</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:15.432
<i>This routine drives me wild</i>

00:15.515 --> 00:19.686
<i>No more emotions</i>

00:19.769 --> 00:21.771
<i>Keep going until the end</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:24.232
<i>Don't look back</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:52.218
Look on the bright side.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.679
At least they let us play.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.140
At least we made it
to the next round, right?

00:57.223 --> 00:59.476
Yeah, but without an audience.

01:01.561 --> 01:05.648
The problem is the competition
depends on the popular vote.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.401
And no one even knows who we are.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.988
It shouldn't be based on that.
It should be based on talent.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.283
Selena, those are the rules
of the Battle of the Bands

01:15.366 --> 01:16.242
and life itself.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.579
Look, we just need people to see us once.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.207
Just once and bang!

01:22.290 --> 01:24.334
We'll blow their minds.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.377
I'm serious. Right, man?

01:27.545 --> 01:29.005
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.965
It's nothing. All good.

01:32.717 --> 01:36.012
You really can't remember
what happened to you?

01:36.638 --> 01:37.972
-Nothing?
-No.

01:38.890 --> 01:39.933
I know.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.351
Fucking amnesia.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.437
Weird. I thought
that only happened in soap operas.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.355
I guess not.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.453
Not even a face? A voice?

02:01.579 --> 02:02.413
Sorry.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.666
I don't remember. I wish I did.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.835
You don't have to apologize.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.336
Of course he does.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.923
What were you doing
in the rehearsal room so late?

02:12.006 --> 02:13.133
Lourdes, please.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.218
I forgot my bag there.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.221
And you thought the best time to get it

02:18.304 --> 02:20.473
was when you had to be on stage?

02:20.557 --> 02:23.601
Okay. That's enough for today.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.816
Esteban, we're just trying to help you.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.403
Anything you might remember is important.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.989
Anything. Don't hesitate to tell me.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.031
Okay?

02:37.115 --> 02:37.949
Thank you.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.910
Anita, please walk Esteban out.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.911
Okay. Let's go.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.375
-You played so well today.
-Thanks.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.418
Wait a second!

02:49.627 --> 02:52.088
We found this in the rehearsal room.
Is it yours?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.257
Yeah, it's my… my music.

02:56.050 --> 02:56.926
Thank you.

03:08.479 --> 03:09.856
THE DISK IN DRIVE E: CAN'T BE READ

03:09.939 --> 03:11.983
Shit. Damn it.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.779
We have nothing on Sebas.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.116
The condom and mask I saw disappeared.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.868
What condom?

03:22.827 --> 03:26.289
The first time I went into Sebas' room,
I saw a condom wrapper.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.082
Nothing to do with me.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.335
He's been screwing someone else.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.670
Someone with horrible perfume, by the way.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.925
Sebas got rid of everything
we could've used against him.

03:41.137 --> 03:41.971
So, now what?

03:44.557 --> 03:45.391
Now what?

03:49.437 --> 03:51.314
He thinks he's the king of the world.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.440
"I'm Sebas, dude."

03:53.983 --> 03:55.485
"I'm the greatest, man."

03:57.403 --> 03:58.738
Pathetic.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.497
Let's kill two birds with one stone.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.624
What's up?

04:09.707 --> 04:12.335
I have some gossip for you.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.259
THE NONAMES INVITE YOU
AFTER SCHOOL PARTY - SURPRISE ACT

04:23.388 --> 04:25.181
<i>So, what?</i> <i>A party at your house?</i>

04:25.932 --> 04:28.142
So, you want to ruin our weekend?

04:28.226 --> 04:30.979
We want people to know us and see us play.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.690
Won't your parents freak out?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.400
My parents are in Valle.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.027
So we have the house to ourselves.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.030
And if you spend the night,
I can heal your wounds.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.574
-I'm in so much pain.
-Gross.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.453
I'm guessing it'll be
your first party, right?

04:48.037 --> 04:49.080
-No.
-No?

04:49.163 --> 04:50.415
I always go to parties.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.085
I like that.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.630
And what do you think
about popping your cherry?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.719
So I'll see you guys after class?

05:03.344 --> 05:04.178
Bye.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.808
THE NONAMES CHAT WITHOUT LUKA
MY ROOM IN 5

05:13.563 --> 05:18.067
I have a theory that you guys
have a chat with Luka that I'm not in.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.485
It's nothing personal.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.362
So why didn't you invite him?

05:21.446 --> 05:23.448
Because I don't trust him 100%.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.490
You'll see.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.703
The party isn't just
so the school sees us play.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.748
I have a more important reason.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.374
I don't get it.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.168
What's more important than that?

05:35.793 --> 05:38.254
Screwing over Sebastián Langarica.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.589
Wait, what?

05:39.672 --> 05:42.091
Well, he's the one behind all of this.

05:42.633 --> 05:46.512
The fire, the threats,
the attack on Esteban.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.307
We just need him to confess.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.560
How do we make that happen?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.229
With a whole lot of tamarind vodka.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.398
So your plan is,

05:57.482 --> 05:59.067
Sebas goes to your party,

05:59.150 --> 06:00.109
gets drunk,

06:00.193 --> 06:01.861
and confesses everything.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.571
On camera.

06:03.654 --> 06:06.949
No offense, Jani,
but that doesn't make sense.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.078
You're trusting a lot of things
to fall into place…

06:10.161 --> 06:12.163
A lot of things that will happen.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.664
Dude, I know him.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.459
It's too risky.
What if he doesn't want to drink?

06:17.543 --> 06:19.629
What if he brings friends or bodyguards?

06:20.254 --> 06:23.549
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.843
Dixon's with me, right?

06:27.261 --> 06:30.807
Well, it's not like
we have a lot of options.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.976
And I don't think
it's that bad of an idea.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.062
Just one thing.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.147
You can't get Sebas drunk.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.191
I mean, the guy hates you.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.068
Well,

06:42.568 --> 06:44.946
that's why we need one more thing

06:45.029 --> 06:46.948
that Sebastián Langarica loves.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.117
And what's that?

06:53.704 --> 06:55.706
No, MJ. No.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.125
It's our last chance.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.209
Believe me,

06:58.292 --> 06:59.877
I know him. He'll fall for it.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.464
So…

07:05.883 --> 07:06.843
I'm in.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.649
Jana, seriously.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.194
Are you sure Sebas is going to show up?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.488
The plan only works if he does.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.198
How are you going to pull that off?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.451
He's not exactly dying to see you.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.203
Dixon, the whole school
will be at the party.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.289
The king of EWS won't miss it.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.722
WE WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING

07:52.805 --> 07:54.348
Luka, let's go.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.357
Yes.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.151
Let's go.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.113
No way.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.326
Dude, you could buy my house
and my whole family

08:13.409 --> 08:15.828
just with what you have here. Incredible.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.748
Wow. Is that a Franz Marc?

08:18.831 --> 08:21.542
-Yeah.
-How many Franz Marcs have you seen?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.796
-Huh?
-How many have you seen?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.133
Residente is a fan.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.093
That's how I know him,

08:31.177 --> 08:33.846
but I'm more into street art and all that.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.015
-Okay.
-Do you have any beer here?

08:36.098 --> 08:38.518
The bar is stocked.
Take whatever you want.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.686
Dixon, can I talk to you?

08:43.648 --> 08:45.024
He's stealing your girl.

08:45.107 --> 08:48.027
Sorry, since I got jumped,
my hearing is off.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.493
Who wants a drink?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.915
Well, cheers.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.375
To us!

09:02.458 --> 09:03.501
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.794
Cheers, everyone.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.758
Weren't we doing a shot?

09:11.467 --> 09:13.886
Hey, take it slow.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.973
-It seems like beer's not your thing.
-Can you tell?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.684
It's the young lady's first time. Right?

09:19.767 --> 09:20.726
At a party.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.312
Without parents, with alcohol.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.022
This is my first beer.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.857
And my second mezcal, my friend.

09:26.941 --> 09:27.817
Cheers.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.699
Did you lose something?

09:35.449 --> 09:37.326
Yeah. My hearing, actually.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.538
Makes sense, all that public transit.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.041
No, dude. It's because someone beat me up.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.962
I don't remember how I got there,

09:48.045 --> 09:49.422
but I'm starting to remember.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.925
Did the party move over here, or what?

09:55.011 --> 09:56.178
A little lower.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.808
Perfect.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.226
Let me see.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.145
Look.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.150
All set.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.402
What's next?

10:12.278 --> 10:13.404
The easy part.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.007
-What?
-I love this dress.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.636
My friend's the designer.
It's one of a kind.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.763
-You have designer friends?
-Yeah.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.598
Try it on.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.476
We can try something less bold
if you want.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.560
No, it's perfect.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.853
Do you think it'll fit?

10:45.936 --> 10:48.314
Yes. It's going to look great on you.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.067
-Yes!
-Try it on.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.860
Hey, MJ.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.906
If you feel uncomfortable at any point,
please, tell me.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.823
I don't want…

10:58.824 --> 11:00.284
I agreed to this, okay?

11:00.368 --> 11:02.036
I want to help expose Sebas.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.705
I guess.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.881
Andi.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.593
Talk to Jana.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.179
Tell her I should get Sebas drunk.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.640
So MJ won't have to do anything
she doesn't want to.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.059
Dude, she's excited.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.353
-No, she doesn't want to.
-Clearly, she does.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.647
Don't say she wants to, because…

11:31.148 --> 11:31.982
Wow.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.320
I'd hit that. Wow.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.033
I need a beer.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.163
New look?

11:47.998 --> 11:50.501
We decided that MJ will sing tonight.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.962
Didn't we tell you? Weird.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.965
Yeah, we haven't even picked a song.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.344
I was thinking we could play
something like Metric.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.846
Something by Santa Sabina?

12:01.929 --> 12:03.389
No way, grandpa.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.516
-Daddy Yankee.
-Taylor Swift?

12:05.599 --> 12:06.517
No, please.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.560
-She's cool.
-No.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.061
-What if…
-Let's play…

12:10.187 --> 12:12.440
-Bomba Estéreo.
-Bomba Estéreo is good.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.358
-Guys!
-Miley Cyrus.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.445
I'm the one singing, right?
I should choose.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.238
Great, Selena. Pick a song.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.531
Yes. MJ, you choose.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.908
Esteban, help me with the equipment?

12:22.992 --> 12:24.201
What equipment?

12:25.077 --> 12:25.911
Oh.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.080
Another beer?

12:28.164 --> 12:29.081
No.

12:29.832 --> 12:30.666
Come here.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.710
Don't give MJ more to drink.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.555
-Can I say something?
-What?

12:44.638 --> 12:47.725
Honestly, your room is
exactly how I imagined it.

12:47.808 --> 12:48.768
Hush!

12:49.935 --> 12:51.353
Wanna see something funny?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.271
Okay.

12:53.063 --> 12:53.981
Ready?

12:56.233 --> 12:57.359
No.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.695
Be honest,
even though you're my boyfriend.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.115
-Boyfriend?
-No, I didn't mean that.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.368
It's not like we're a couple.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.578
We are a couple.

13:08.704 --> 13:11.040
It sounds so cringey
when you say it out loud.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.625
But I like it.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.015
MJ.

13:28.849 --> 13:32.019
MJ, I was thinking. This is too risky.

13:32.102 --> 13:35.481
I know guys like Sebas.
He'll cut right to the chase.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.775
-Do you have another plan?
-No.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.444
So you'd rather let Sebas
keep torturing us.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.362
Of course not.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.823
You don't think I can make him confess?

13:43.906 --> 13:45.324
You don't think he'll like me?

13:45.950 --> 13:48.953
Look, if he doesn't like you,
he's an idiot.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.168
I just want to protect you.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.087
That's my dad's job.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.682
-In your mouth or on your clothes?
-What?

14:09.765 --> 14:12.893
-Do you want the shot on your coat…
-No, no way.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.606
This way.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.493
<i>Baby, I can't take it</i>

14:30.286 --> 14:32.329
<i>Baby, I can't take it</i>

14:32.872 --> 14:34.248
<i>Dixon, okay</i>

14:37.126 --> 14:38.669
<i>Dixon, baby</i>

14:39.253 --> 14:41.422
<i>-MJ</i>
<i>-No, no</i>

14:44.758 --> 14:48.721
<i>Once again</i>
<i>I'm thinking of you</i>

14:49.889 --> 14:51.640
<i>Once again</i>

14:51.724 --> 14:53.976
<i>I hear your voice</i>

14:54.059 --> 14:56.604
<i>And I'm lost again</i>

14:56.687 --> 14:58.898
<i>Thinking of you</i>

14:59.940 --> 15:01.609
<i>Once again</i>

15:01.692 --> 15:05.654
<i>I hear your voice</i>
<i>And I'm lost again</i>

15:05.738 --> 15:08.240
<i>I'm dying over those lips</i>

15:08.324 --> 15:10.618
<i>That face makes my heart stop</i>

15:10.701 --> 15:13.162
<i>Since I know you want it</i>
<i>I'm staying</i>

15:13.245 --> 15:15.789
<i>Know that I don't like to share</i>

15:15.873 --> 15:18.500
<i>I left behind all the girls online</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:21.045
<i>Because when I'm with you</i>
<i>I feel just fine</i>

15:21.128 --> 15:23.589
<i>You came my way and you left me upside</i>

15:23.672 --> 15:26.091
<i>Now you're the only one</i>
<i>On my mind</i>

15:26.175 --> 15:28.928
<i>I left behind all the boys online</i>

15:29.011 --> 15:31.096
<i>Because when I'm with you</i>
<i>I feel just fine</i>

15:31.180 --> 15:33.307
<i>Baby, you came my way</i>
<i>And left me upside</i>

15:33.390 --> 15:35.643
<i>Now you're the only one</i>
<i>On my mind</i>

15:35.726 --> 15:37.144
<i>Once again</i>

15:37.227 --> 15:39.396
<i>Thinking of you</i>

15:40.397 --> 15:42.024
<i>Once again</i>

15:42.107 --> 15:44.193
<i>I hear your voice</i>

15:44.276 --> 15:46.445
<i>And I'm lost again</i>

15:46.528 --> 15:49.865
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me</i>

15:49.949 --> 15:51.283
<i>Tell me, MJ</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:54.912
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me</i>

15:54.995 --> 15:56.372
<i>Tell me again</i>

15:57.498 --> 16:00.125
<i>-Oh yeah, baby</i>
<i>-MJ</i>

16:00.209 --> 16:02.962
<i>-Tell me again</i>
<i>-MJ</i>

16:04.505 --> 16:06.507
<i>Yeah, Dixon</i>

16:09.134 --> 16:11.387
You should see this house. Hideous.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.347
The decor is horrible, the art…

16:13.430 --> 16:15.182
What's up, Luka. Are you lost?

16:19.728 --> 16:22.231
I just want to tell you,
I know everything.

16:22.898 --> 16:25.943
I remember, you set me up to get jumped.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.488
Not again with the soap opera plot.
It wasn't me.

16:30.072 --> 16:30.906
Get it?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.200
So you're going to keep playing dumb?

16:35.327 --> 16:38.247
Are you calling your bosses
to tell them I know?

16:39.248 --> 16:40.624
Are you threatening me?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.795
If you want to call it that, yes.
It's a threat.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.131
What, is your tribe going to attack me?

16:47.965 --> 16:48.966
No, moron.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.927
But I can tell the band
and the school what you did.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.137
You don't want that.

16:53.637 --> 16:57.474
I don't know what this is.
But leave me alone or you'll regret it.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.019
What's up, lovebirds?

17:00.978 --> 17:02.438
Get a room already.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.043
What if he doesn't come?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.504
At this rate,
they'll all be too drunk to hear us play.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.799
Come on.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.551
-Hey, Sebas!
-What's up?

18:03.373 --> 18:05.125
Good evening, everyone!

18:10.839 --> 18:12.800
I hope you're having a good time.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.010
Okay. Are we playing or what?

18:15.719 --> 18:16.804
Come on!

18:23.727 --> 18:25.938
-Is everything okay?
-Yep, all good.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.112
We are The Nonames!

18:33.195 --> 18:35.948
-Show us your tits!
-Show us your balls, idiot.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.324
That's right.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.826
Okay, come on, Nonames.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.369
-Let's kill it.
-Come on.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.162
-Let's go.
-Okay.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.386
<i>I</i>

18:58.971 --> 19:02.641
<i>I gave you all my love</i>
<i>And so much more</i>

19:02.724 --> 19:05.060
<i>And you</i>

19:05.644 --> 19:08.856
<i>Don't know what love means</i>

19:10.107 --> 19:11.150
<i>And I</i>

19:12.818 --> 19:15.487
<i>Laid myself at your feet</i>

19:16.321 --> 19:21.618
<i>And you just left me aside</i>
<i>But now</i>

19:22.202 --> 19:26.123
<i>If I ever said I loved you</i>
<i>Now I regret it</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:29.835
<i>If I ever said I loved you</i>

19:29.918 --> 19:33.046
<i>I must've been crazy</i>

19:33.130 --> 19:35.549
<i>If I ever said I loved you</i>

19:35.632 --> 19:38.260
<i>And I'd give my life for you</i>

19:38.343 --> 19:40.554
<i>If I ever said I loved you</i>

19:40.637 --> 19:43.348
<i>I won't do it again</i>

19:43.432 --> 19:46.393
<i>That mistake is in the past</i>

19:47.060 --> 19:48.770
<i>That mistake is in the past</i>

19:48.854 --> 19:51.064
<i>You know, I tried until the end</i>

19:51.148 --> 19:53.108
<i>I fought, for what?</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:54.902
<i>You're out of my life</i>

19:54.985 --> 19:56.612
<i>I'm tired</i>

19:56.695 --> 19:58.322
<i>And I</i>

19:59.198 --> 20:02.868
<i>I know you'll be back one day</i>

20:03.452 --> 20:05.287
<i>And you</i>

20:06.622 --> 20:10.792
<i>You'll regret everything</i>

20:10.876 --> 20:11.919
<i>I</i>

20:13.420 --> 20:16.131
<i>I laid myself at your feet</i>

20:17.341 --> 20:22.471
<i>And you just left me aside</i>
<i>But now</i>

20:23.055 --> 20:25.182
<i>If I ever said I loved you</i>

20:25.265 --> 20:28.060
<i>And I'd give my life for you</i>

20:28.143 --> 20:30.103
<i>If I ever said I loved you</i>

20:30.187 --> 20:33.190
<i>I won't do it again</i>

20:33.273 --> 20:34.816
<i>That mistake</i>

20:34.900 --> 20:40.030
<i>Is in the past</i>

20:45.369 --> 20:49.248
MJ!

20:51.833 --> 20:53.710
-Where are you going?
-Don't worry.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.837
MJ!

21:24.533 --> 21:25.534
Pizza's here.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.911
What's up with you and Luka?

21:28.537 --> 21:29.663
Um…

21:30.247 --> 21:31.957
Nothing. Why do you ask?

21:32.457 --> 21:34.167
When we were about to play,

21:34.251 --> 21:36.086
you looked ready to kill each other.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.505
I guess I glared at him

21:38.588 --> 21:40.340
or gave him a dirty look.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.425
How are you?

21:41.508 --> 21:42.342
Are you okay?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.053
Are you sure?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.475
Wow.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.311
Look at this.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.604
Jana has it all.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.317
Not everything.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.365
Thanks.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.658
My dad taught me.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.828
He taught me to play the drums too.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.038
Like his idol,

22:11.121 --> 22:13.123
Stephen Perkins from Jane's Addiction.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.043
He was that good.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.588
Wherever he is, I'm sure he's proud.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.551
My dad, however,

22:25.844 --> 22:28.722
I don't think he's ever
taught me anything.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.725
Well, he taught me not to be like him.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.687
No one's going to play me for a fool.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.356
Just Sebas.

22:39.149 --> 22:39.983
Sorry.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.988
Andi, what I do,
or don't do, is my business.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.324
If it bothers you so much,
why are you here?

22:47.407 --> 22:48.909
It won't end any time soon.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.453
That's what pisses me off.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.997
That someone like you
accepts that treatment.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.625
Someone like me?

22:56.708 --> 22:57.584
What am I like?

23:01.713 --> 23:03.340
Aren't you going to answer?

23:05.092 --> 23:05.926
Okay.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.430
Let's go.

23:23.860 --> 23:26.613
MJ! You were great.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.781
Thank you so much.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.698
Cheers.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.119
I loved it.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.329
They're right, it was cool.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.331
The band sucked, but you were great.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.793
I noticed you watching me.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.922
Is the whole bottle for you?
Because I'm thirsty.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.051
Why don't we go somewhere more

23:48.635 --> 23:49.636
private?

23:51.847 --> 23:52.681
Okay.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.225
Where to?

23:58.437 --> 23:59.271
They're going.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.777
Come on.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.321
Dixon!

24:09.364 --> 24:10.615
They went to the hot tub.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.076
Luka.

24:13.743 --> 24:14.828
Jani.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.167
Are you coming?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.002
Yeah, I'll catch up.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.681
Sorry.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.724
Did I hurt you?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.767
It's all right. It's fine.

24:37.851 --> 24:38.894
You're beautiful.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.278
Are you okay?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.532
It's just… It's my first time.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.577
No way, Emilia.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.747
I don't care
if you've screwed a million girls.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.583
It's fine. It's not my first time either.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.752
It's my first time with a girl.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.548
That's all right.

25:09.090 --> 25:12.594
We don't have to do anything.
We can get more beer,

25:12.677 --> 25:14.888
talk to some friends, dance a bit.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.075
Again? What is it?

25:35.158 --> 25:37.827
Why are you so obsessed? What do you want?

25:37.911 --> 25:38.870
Listen, asshole.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.998
You have a photo of this woman
on your computer.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.667
Her name's Rocío. She's my mom.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.377
Why were you on my computer?

25:45.460 --> 25:49.297
I have reason to believe
that your father knows where she is.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.466
Do you want to sit here?

25:54.052 --> 25:55.303
I have a better idea.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.979
-You're crazy.
-Listen, dude.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.231
Why the fuck is her photo
on your computer?

26:06.982 --> 26:08.900
I don't have a swimsuit, though.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.110
So what?

26:11.027 --> 26:12.153
Well…

26:15.198 --> 26:17.576
Right, your Christian thing.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.122
What do you know? What did your dad do?

26:22.205 --> 26:25.542
Stop. This isn't a soap opera.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.337
My dad didn't do anything.
You have nothing on me.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.381
Did you hear me? Nothing.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.636
You're weird.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.888
-You're boring.
-The dress…

26:41.850 --> 26:43.560
That's you, you're boring.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.187
I'm not boring, okay?

26:49.983 --> 26:50.900
There they are.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.082
Hi.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.794
-"Hi."
-I don't talk like that.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.463
-That's how you said it.
-No.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.631
-Here.
-Okay.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.054
Truth or dare?

27:21.264 --> 27:24.184
-The game. Truth or dare.
-I know what it is, but…

27:25.435 --> 27:27.979
If you don't want to play,
we don't have to.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.191
Okay.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.485
Truth.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.033
Are you a virgin?

27:41.868 --> 27:43.536
<i>Why do you want to know?</i>

27:45.622 --> 27:48.166
<i>You can't answer a question</i>
<i>with a question.</i>

27:50.043 --> 27:50.919
Yes.

27:51.753 --> 27:52.587
You?

27:54.172 --> 27:56.257
First you have to ask, "Truth or dare."

27:57.008 --> 27:58.218
Truth or dare?

28:01.054 --> 28:01.930
<i>Truth.</i>

28:02.013 --> 28:05.684
<i>What would you do</i>
<i>if Esteban Torres were here?</i>

28:05.767 --> 28:07.185
<i>What kind of question is that?</i>

28:07.268 --> 28:09.437
<i>I mean, he stole your girlfriend.</i>

28:09.521 --> 28:12.732
<i>Listen, people like that</i>
<i>don't deserve your attention.</i>

28:13.441 --> 28:14.901
<i>Truth or dare?</i>

28:15.485 --> 28:16.820
Dare.

28:16.903 --> 28:17.737
Okay.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.282
Kiss me or take another shot.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.351
-Dixon, what's wrong?
-Jana, I don't like this.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.353
And you think I do?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.480
-But we're in this.
-<i>Truth or dare?</i>

28:52.564 --> 28:53.398
<i>Truth.</i>

28:53.481 --> 28:55.525
<i>Okay, Mr. Langarica…</i>

28:56.735 --> 28:59.821
Tell me, Sebastián Langarica.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.282
Are you part of a secret society?

29:03.074 --> 29:05.452
-A society…
-What's with these questions?

29:05.535 --> 29:06.703
Is it you?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.457
You want me to tell you
I'm part of The Lodge.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.208
The Lodge?

29:12.792 --> 29:14.627
<i>What is that? Are you a member?</i>

29:15.503 --> 29:17.797
<i>Wow. Is that a yes?</i>

29:18.548 --> 29:21.134
Are you? Is that what you do at night?

29:21.217 --> 29:23.219
-Well…
-The Lodge!

29:23.303 --> 29:24.387
Yes.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.769
<i>Did you start the fire?</i>

29:32.353 --> 29:33.438
So, yes?

29:33.521 --> 29:35.523
Do I have to take a test to get in?

29:36.149 --> 29:37.275
I know what this is.

29:39.861 --> 29:40.820
What do you mean?

29:54.709 --> 29:55.668
Whatever.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.800
Dixon, slow down!

30:07.347 --> 30:08.223
Jana…

30:09.641 --> 30:11.810
What do you want? What?

30:12.310 --> 30:14.604
You sent your friend to humiliate me?

30:14.687 --> 30:16.064
I know it was all you.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.317
The fire, the attack on Esteban.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.070
The mask was in your room, fucking psycho.

30:24.864 --> 30:25.698
MJ!

30:27.575 --> 30:28.535
MJ!

30:32.956 --> 30:37.418
You're a psycho. You used your friend
like she's expendable.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.004
Let go of me.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.847
It was me, Jana.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.473
There.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.475
It was me.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.726
I did it.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.187
All of it.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.024
And you couldn't record it.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.277
No one will believe you, Jana.

31:03.736 --> 31:04.779
Accept it.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.370
<i>MJ!</i>

31:18.585 --> 31:19.836
-Are you okay?
-There.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.713
It's over.

31:22.463 --> 31:23.298
It's okay.

31:28.052 --> 31:28.887
Hello.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.013
<i>What now, Luka?</i>

31:30.096 --> 31:31.347
What did you do to Rocío?

31:31.431 --> 31:32.265
<i>What?</i>

31:32.348 --> 31:34.559
What did you do to Rocío?
My music teacher.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.896
The one you fired without notice.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.064
That Rocío.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.537
I put Jana in her place.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.958
Let's go to your house.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.692
