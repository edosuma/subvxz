00:06.889 --> 00:08.151
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:08.324 --> 00:11.259
Look at this.
Every year during a heat wave...

00:11.427 --> 00:15.056
...somebody always fries an egg
on the sidewalk.

00:15.231 --> 00:18.325
Then they print a picture of it
in the newspaper.

00:20.336 --> 00:22.736
This is the egg.

00:22.905 --> 00:26.102
- Then what is this?
- Oh, yeah. I heard about that on the news.

00:26.275 --> 00:30.211
How can anybody think
skydiving is a safe sport?

00:32.848 --> 00:35.442
Hi, gang. Hot enough for you?

00:35.618 --> 00:38.053
Have you noticed how
he never sweats?

00:38.221 --> 00:40.781
I don't understand.
I think everybody sweats.

00:41.424 --> 00:43.449
Except snakes.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.396
- I read that.
- Where?

00:48.565 --> 00:50.465
At the dentist.

00:52.402 --> 00:54.529
Hi, gang. Hot enough for you?

00:54.704 --> 00:57.070
How many times
have you heard that today?

00:57.240 --> 00:59.231
- You want a lick?
- Pass.

01:01.945 --> 01:04.572
- Harry, have you got any pants on?
- No.

01:04.748 --> 01:08.013
The radio said it's only gonna
get down to the high 80s...

01:08.184 --> 01:10.209
...and the humidity...
- Harry.

01:10.387 --> 01:13.845
- You really don't?
- No. Here. Look.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.094
- Shorts.
- With knee-high black socks...

01:19.262 --> 01:20.627
...they'll never know.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.959
Here's the guy we're looking for.
Art, what's going on?

01:24.134 --> 01:25.567
How come no air conditioning?

01:25.735 --> 01:28.898
Yeah. It's 20 degrees hotter in here
than it is outside.

01:29.072 --> 01:31.802
What is this? I don't get "hello"
or a "how are you."

01:31.975 --> 01:35.172
I get complaints.
You people crack me up.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.007
- Hello, Art. How are you?
- Fine, thanks. Yourself?

01:38.181 --> 01:42.482
Not bad. Just a little heatstroke.
Why not fix the air conditioning, Art?

01:42.653 --> 01:45.349
Nothing to fix. The a.c. Is fine.
I just turned it off.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.787
- What?
- Hey, rules is rules.

01:47.959 --> 01:50.223
I got a memo right here
from the mayor himself.

01:50.394 --> 01:52.157
He says, "We gotta lessen
the burden...

01:52.330 --> 01:55.163
...on our already overtaxed
electrical systems."

01:55.333 --> 01:58.769
- So to prevent a power failure...
- I'm taking out the light bulbs. Right.

02:01.973 --> 02:03.941
Hey, what the...?

02:04.475 --> 02:08.172
Hey, yo, unplug that puppy right now.

02:11.115 --> 02:13.845
The responsibility is awesome.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074

02:56.728 --> 02:59.788
The court fines the defendant $50.

03:02.267 --> 03:04.633
Next case, Your Honor.

03:04.803 --> 03:06.566
- Art!
- Yo!

03:06.738 --> 03:09.002
- What's going on?
- I'm tapping the wall.

03:10.175 --> 03:12.040
I can hear that. Why?

03:12.210 --> 03:15.668
To be prepared for a brownout with
the emergency generator on this floor...

03:15.847 --> 03:17.576
...so I gotta find a wall receptacle.

03:18.483 --> 03:21.509
- I'll rip this place apart if I have to.
- Yeah.

03:22.220 --> 03:25.951
- Just do it quietly, huh?
- You won't even know I'm here. I swear.

03:29.895 --> 03:31.385
Next case, Miss Wagner.

03:31.563 --> 03:33.588
<i>State v. Yakov Korolenko,
Your Honor,</i>

03:33.765 --> 03:37.292
Possession of stolen materials
with intent to sell.

03:37.469 --> 03:39.198
Watches.

03:40.072 --> 03:44.442
- Yakov Korolenko.
- Hello, Joe.

03:46.179 --> 03:48.238
Might we have
a language problem here?

03:48.414 --> 03:49.779
We definitely might.

03:49.949 --> 03:52.281
My client speaks only a few words
of English...

03:52.452 --> 03:55.182
...and we haven't been able
to find a Russian interpreter.

03:55.354 --> 03:57.652
- But we are working on it.
- Yes, sir.

03:57.824 --> 04:00.816
I understand you're looking
for somebody that speaks Russian.

04:01.794 --> 04:05.321
- Do you speak Russian?
- No, but I'll give it a shot.

04:06.466 --> 04:09.697
- Thanks. We'll manage.
- I'm gonna run and get some flex cable.

04:09.869 --> 04:11.598
Have a ball.

04:13.039 --> 04:15.507
Considering the facts,
there's nothing we can do...

04:15.675 --> 04:19.338
...but continue the case until we find
an interpreter for Mr. Korolenko.

04:19.512 --> 04:22.845
Well, may I request that my client
be released on bail until that time?

04:23.015 --> 04:25.415
- Mr. Prosecutor?
- I'm afraid the people can't agree.

04:25.585 --> 04:27.678
As of yet, we don't know who he is...

04:27.854 --> 04:30.152
...or what he is.

04:30.923 --> 04:33.016
Go, Yankees!

04:34.560 --> 04:36.960
Lou Pinella.

04:37.430 --> 04:39.523
I rest my case.

04:39.932 --> 04:41.661
I'm afraid the court must agree.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.861
Until we can be sure of his reputation
and responsibility...

04:45.038 --> 04:48.132
...I think the prudent course to take
is clear. Mr. Korolenko.

04:48.308 --> 04:50.242
- Yakov.
- Right.

05:03.056 --> 05:05.581
Yaki. Yes. Mr. Korolenko...

05:05.759 --> 05:08.091
...I know you don't understand
a word I'm saying...

05:08.262 --> 05:10.890
...but it appears that you
may have broken the law.

05:11.064 --> 05:13.965
$29.95.

05:14.134 --> 05:17.262
Undoubtedly a fair price,
but that is not the question before us.

05:17.437 --> 05:21.533
I want you to receive a fair trial. We do not
want to send an innocent man to jail.

05:22.009 --> 05:26.002
Jail? No jail. No! No jail!

05:26.180 --> 05:28.774
I think we found another word he knows.

05:28.949 --> 05:31.179
- No jail.
- You don't understand.

05:31.351 --> 05:33.581
Look at him, Your Honor.
He's scared.

05:33.754 --> 05:36.222
Of course he's scared.
I'm sure his concept of jail...

05:36.390 --> 05:40.349
...includes visions of midnight raids,
secret police, torture.

05:40.527 --> 05:42.461
Torture?

05:42.796 --> 05:45.492
No! No torture! No!

05:45.666 --> 05:49.034
Quite a little vocabulary
he has there.

05:50.438 --> 05:52.406
- Art!
- Yo!

05:52.574 --> 05:54.132
- Is that gasoline?
- Yeah.

05:54.309 --> 05:56.106
- What's it for?
- It's for the generator.

05:56.277 --> 05:59.872
I figured I'd save a trip, especially since
I shut the elevator down for the night.

06:00.048 --> 06:02.346
We're on the 18th floor!

06:03.084 --> 06:06.781
Women just don't understand
power consumption, do they?

06:07.255 --> 06:10.418
- I'm gonna put this over here, okay?
- Quietly, please.

06:17.131 --> 06:19.964
Miss Williams, I'm afraid
there's nothing more I can do now...

06:20.134 --> 06:22.398
...but have Mr. Korolenko
wait in the holding pen.

06:22.837 --> 06:26.068
- Holding pen?
- It's like a little jail.

06:26.241 --> 06:28.573
- Jail? No!
- Bull.

06:28.743 --> 06:32.736
- No jail! No!
- Okay. Come on, you.

06:33.514 --> 06:36.210
Oh, no!

06:37.318 --> 06:40.287
Hey, put a lid on it, will you?

06:40.455 --> 06:43.549
- Cool it!
- Bull, he does not speak English.

06:43.958 --> 06:48.794
Listen, you.
I am gonna take you in there...

06:48.964 --> 06:51.762
...so just cut the chatter.

06:51.934 --> 06:54.528
Oh, no!

06:58.107 --> 07:00.701
That poor man. He's so terrified.

07:00.876 --> 07:02.707
Remember that he comes
from a system...

07:02.878 --> 07:04.846
...where anyone can be arrested
on the street...

07:05.014 --> 07:07.574
...and, without valid explanation,
be put behind bars...

07:07.750 --> 07:10.810
...for an indefinite amount of time
without a trial.

07:10.986 --> 07:13.386
Kind of like we just did.

07:13.555 --> 07:18.219
- No! No jail! No! No!
- Grab that guy!

07:18.394 --> 07:20.521
Mr. Korolenko!

07:20.696 --> 07:23.096
- No!
- Yakov!

07:27.436 --> 07:29.233
- Yakov.
- Harry, be careful.

07:29.405 --> 07:33.603
I know things seem desperate right now,
but believe me, it's not that bad.

07:33.776 --> 07:35.801
Don't do anything foolish.

07:43.118 --> 07:46.645
Okay. Don't do anything else foolish.

07:52.228 --> 07:55.220
All right. Yakov, take it easy.
Everyone, take it easy.

07:55.398 --> 07:58.299
We can work this thing out.
There is no danger here.

07:58.468 --> 08:01.995
No danger? Don't make me laugh.
This whole building's like a tinder box.

08:02.172 --> 08:03.935
- Art...
- One wrong flick of that pick...

08:04.107 --> 08:05.802
...and boom, we're history.

08:06.509 --> 08:07.498
Please!

08:07.677 --> 08:10.168
See any film on the Hindenburg?

08:10.547 --> 08:12.742
Art, not now!

08:15.018 --> 08:16.781
Yakov, relax. Take it easy.

08:16.953 --> 08:19.421
Don't go bursting into flames
on me now, okay?

08:21.992 --> 08:23.482
He wants to leave.

08:33.003 --> 08:35.198
- No bang-bang.

08:36.606 --> 08:38.801
You heard him. Get out.

08:38.975 --> 08:42.001
Put the bang-bangs away
and get out.

08:44.481 --> 08:46.915
- Bull, clear the courtroom.
- Okay. Everybody out.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.950
I wanna see those legs
pumping, people.

08:55.793 --> 08:59.627
We're just letting the innocent people go.
Just stay calm and be cool.

08:59.797 --> 09:03.893
You got to admit,
the kid is cool in a crisis.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.168
Okay. That's enough
with the lighter already.

09:10.341 --> 09:13.071
This whole place could become
a blazing inferno.

09:13.244 --> 09:16.771
This is turning into
a maintenance man's nightmare.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.744
All right.
Everyone, clear out of here.

09:18.916 --> 09:20.850
We are not gonna leave you
here alone.

09:21.018 --> 09:24.954
I really don't think this is the time
to question the judge's authority.

09:25.556 --> 09:29.014
- I'm not leaving either.
- Will you listen to yourselves, people?

09:29.193 --> 09:32.959
- Liz!
- This is my client and I'm staying.

09:33.130 --> 09:39.069
What we have here is a frightened,
lonely, confused human being.

09:39.236 --> 09:42.933
A stranger in our land
alone in his misery...

09:43.107 --> 09:46.099
...and I, for one, will not desert him...

09:46.277 --> 09:49.440
...in this, this desperate time
of need. Yakov...

09:50.581 --> 09:55.713
...Elizabeth is here until the end.

09:59.324 --> 10:01.087
Cuckoo?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.922
Liz, for God's sake.

10:07.866 --> 10:12.098
- My client. I'm staying.
- My courtroom. You're gone.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.295
Bull, the key.

10:26.852 --> 10:32.882
- Dan, he wants you to do it.
- Me? Why?

10:33.125 --> 10:37.186
Well, perhaps he feels
you're less threatening.

10:39.131 --> 10:40.860
Why?

10:41.733 --> 10:45.066
Because I didn't make any foolish moves
toward him like everybody else?

10:45.237 --> 10:48.229
I'm 6'4". I don't have to flaunt it.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.909
Dan.

10:55.213 --> 10:57.114
Give me the key.

10:59.085 --> 11:04.022
Keep rolling us on the ground
until the flames are out.

11:16.569 --> 11:18.594
You've got to be kidding.

11:18.771 --> 11:20.636
There. There. There. You happy?

11:20.806 --> 11:25.539
Tony Curtis, Sidney Poitier.
What was the name of that movie?

11:25.711 --> 11:28.874
- Harry, he's taking them hostage.
- Hostage?

11:29.048 --> 11:32.279
No. No hostage. Yakov.

11:32.451 --> 11:35.249
No Ayatollah Khomeini.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.085
Oh, boy.

11:41.260 --> 11:45.196
Those psychotic headaches,
little voices telling him what to do...

11:45.364 --> 11:47.798
...stabbing pains in the temples.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.210
Vamoose, buckaroos.

12:03.684 --> 12:06.619
This stuff always happens after
you finish buffing the floors.

12:06.787 --> 12:10.086
I can hear the gasoline
just eating the wax away.

12:10.457 --> 12:12.823
All right, now, no questions.
Everyone, get out.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.860
- The key?
- Do you wanna search him?

12:16.029 --> 12:18.623
I'll get you out of those in a jiffy.
I got a power saw...

12:18.799 --> 12:20.266
No power saw.

12:20.434 --> 12:23.403
The energy crisis.
What am I thinking about?

12:23.704 --> 12:25.069
Is there anything I can do?

12:25.239 --> 12:28.800
- Speed up that search for an interpreter.
- You got it.

12:28.976 --> 12:32.241
Selma, Bull, no one comes in here
without my say-so.

12:32.412 --> 12:33.879
Right. Come on, Selma.

12:34.047 --> 12:38.381
You know, I don't care what they say.
I haven't had a cigarette in a half-hour.

12:38.552 --> 12:41.248
I don't feel any better.

12:44.258 --> 12:45.247
Yakov...

12:51.131 --> 12:53.156
...let's talk.

13:02.277 --> 13:05.974
All right. Thank you. There's no answer
at the Russian consulate...

13:06.147 --> 13:07.876
...and the U.N. Thinks I'm crazy.

13:08.049 --> 13:11.075
Find a Russian restaurant.
Somebody there must speak Russian.

13:11.252 --> 13:12.685
- Great idea.
- Thanks.

13:12.854 --> 13:15.652
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get the Yellow Pages.

13:16.257 --> 13:20.023
- I'm thirsty. How about you?
- No. Thank you.

13:20.194 --> 13:25.154
I must have had six, seven cups of coffee
this evening.

13:31.572 --> 13:34.097
Hey, listen, Dan,
if you really have to...

13:34.275 --> 13:37.142
Okay. Just an offer.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.281
Maybe I could wear a blindfold.

13:43.718 --> 13:46.949
Hey, I'm sorry I took so long,
but a pipe broke in the men's room.

13:47.121 --> 13:50.682
I had to fix it. It was really something.
Water gushing everywhere.

13:50.858 --> 13:53.986
Everything dripping into pools
all over the place.

13:54.162 --> 13:56.187
Start cutting.

13:59.233 --> 14:02.965
You know what really makes me crazy?
Cocktail parties.

14:03.138 --> 14:08.770
Don't you hate them? Idle conversation with
people you got nothing in common with.

14:10.846 --> 14:13.314
You know, even though
we speak different languages...

14:13.482 --> 14:16.007
...I have a feeling that we're
the same kind of person.

14:16.185 --> 14:19.882
The only difference is that I speak English
and you...

14:20.255 --> 14:22.723
...are covered with gasoline.

14:26.395 --> 14:28.260
Since we're gonna be spending
so much time together...

14:28.430 --> 14:31.729
...we might as well be pals.
I'm Harry.

14:32.935 --> 14:36.837
Harry. Yakov. Harry.

14:42.344 --> 14:44.539
That's it. Very good.
Now give me the lighter.

14:44.713 --> 14:47.546
No, no, Harry.

14:49.218 --> 14:50.845
Right.

14:53.288 --> 14:56.985
Yakov, what can I do to make you believe
that I am your friend?

14:58.260 --> 15:00.785
- Friend.
- Yeah. Friend.

15:00.963 --> 15:02.328
Buddy.

15:02.499 --> 15:04.194
Pal.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.362
- Comrade.
- Comrade.

15:06.536 --> 15:10.563
Yeah. Comrade. Harry, comrade.
Comrade, friend.

15:11.107 --> 15:15.043
<i>- Friend, tovarisch.
- Yeah. Tovarisch, pal.</i>

15:15.211 --> 15:16.769
- Pal.
- Buddy.

15:16.946 --> 15:18.743
- Buddy.
- Give me the lighter, buddy.

15:18.915 --> 15:21.383
No way, Jose.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.157
You've been saving that one,
haven't you?

15:38.001 --> 15:42.700
Boy, these handcuffs must be made out
of your hardened carbon steel.

15:42.872 --> 15:45.340
And this was Sears' best.

15:46.709 --> 15:48.370
You're a Russian restaurant.

15:48.545 --> 15:51.537
I mean, surely there must be somebody
there who speaks Russian.

15:51.714 --> 15:55.172
Well, what about the owner?
Perhaps you could call him and...

15:55.351 --> 15:57.717
Sheik who?

15:58.521 --> 15:59.818
Look, relax, okay?

15:59.989 --> 16:02.617
Bull said he could have
a duplicate key made by morning.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.420
What?

16:05.663 --> 16:09.258
You mean like five, six hours?
That morning?

16:09.433 --> 16:13.199
I'll be thinking about it. If I come up
with something, I'll come right back.

16:13.370 --> 16:16.271
Excuse me. I gotta fix the shower
in the guards' lounge.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.034
Been dripping for about a month.
I can't seem to get it.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.475
Drip, drip, drip.
Must lose 30, 40 gallons per day.

16:24.548 --> 16:27.745
You do? Great. I've got somebody
who can speak Russian.

16:27.918 --> 16:30.682
Can you get down to the criminal
courts building right away?

16:30.855 --> 16:32.447
We need a translator.

16:32.623 --> 16:35.148
What? You're kidding.

16:35.326 --> 16:37.624
- He'll only come if we place an order.
- Order.

16:37.795 --> 16:39.990
Okay. I'll take some borscht.

16:40.164 --> 16:42.962
What? It's a $20 minimum
on to-go orders.

16:43.133 --> 16:45.158
Okay. Order me some blintzes.
I'm starving.

16:45.336 --> 16:49.602
Borscht and some blintzes and...
Anything to drink?

16:54.945 --> 16:58.881
Yakov, you've gotta put an end
to this pretty soon.

16:59.350 --> 17:02.717
Eventually you're just gonna get tired
and fall asleep.

17:02.987 --> 17:06.424
Or you're gonna get tired
and accidentally kill us both.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.430
Yeah. I have seen the lighter, Yakov.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.763
You got to put an end to this,
if not for your sake, then for your family.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.929
Now, surely you've got a family.

17:22.874 --> 17:25.900
- Family.
- Family.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.973
Look. Here's mine.

17:28.980 --> 17:31.141
See? That's my Aunt Ruthie...

17:32.083 --> 17:35.382
...and that's my Uncle Otto...

17:35.554 --> 17:40.389
...and that, that is Doris Day.
She came with the wallet.

17:41.793 --> 17:43.021
You got any pictures?

17:44.195 --> 17:46.186
Pictures. Family. You.

17:46.364 --> 17:47.888
Family.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.398
Family. Family.

17:53.004 --> 17:54.562
May I?

17:56.741 --> 18:00.177
Oh, you've got a picture of Brezhnev.

18:02.113 --> 18:04.081
Brezhnev?

18:10.022 --> 18:12.422
Sonya.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.457
- Sonya?
- Sonya.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.567
Oh, your wife. Sonya.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.268
My, what a sturdy woman.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.333
Is she in New York?

18:32.144 --> 18:35.011
No New York. Sonya Leningrad.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.843
- Sonya's in Leningrad.
- Leningrad.

18:40.419 --> 18:43.855
Let me guess.
You came here to get a job...

18:44.023 --> 18:47.481
...and earn enough money
to bring Sonya over to be with you...

18:47.660 --> 18:50.185
...but you couldn't find work,
not speaking the language...

18:50.363 --> 18:53.230
...and then one day you met a man...

18:53.399 --> 18:57.199
...and he sold you some stuff.
You didn't know it was stolen.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.930
He took advantage of you.
Am I close?

19:04.043 --> 19:06.568
Well, it's probably something like that.

19:06.746 --> 19:10.615
Oh, I could be wrong. You may have
indeed known that the stuff was stolen...

19:10.784 --> 19:12.411
...but I don't think so.

19:12.586 --> 19:19.082
I just can't believe that of a man
who has such a woman as Sonya.

19:20.027 --> 19:21.756
Sonya.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.695
Sonya and...

19:24.965 --> 19:28.765
...three dumpy little kids.

19:30.037 --> 19:31.800
Yakov's.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.841
All right, all right.
Please, please, hurry.

19:38.145 --> 19:39.442
The food will be here
in 20 minutes.

19:39.613 --> 19:43.549
I'm gonna let Harry know
that the interpreter is on his way.

19:43.717 --> 19:45.048
Sit tight.

19:50.157 --> 19:53.456
- How you doing?
- Fine.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.591
It really is just mind over matter.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.966
I'll be all right. Thanks.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.898
You're welcome.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.437
Say, Liz, what's that perfume
you're wearing?

20:10.610 --> 20:13.512
- Soiree. Like it?
- It's all right.

20:13.681 --> 20:16.514
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

20:20.788 --> 20:22.653
- Liz?
- Yes?

20:22.824 --> 20:24.655
I'm ready now.

20:26.694 --> 20:29.595
- I can't hear anything.
- It just quieted down.

20:29.764 --> 20:32.062
The judge was talking up
a storm before.

20:32.233 --> 20:36.863
- About what?
- Cocktail parties, ugly kids...

20:37.705 --> 20:39.639
...Doris Day.

20:40.007 --> 20:42.100
Doris Day?

20:42.343 --> 20:44.834
- Hi.
- Hi. Where are you guys going?

20:45.012 --> 20:47.742
We gotta... I'm going to...
We gotta...

20:49.817 --> 20:52.945
Whoa, hey, what a mess.
It broke again.

20:53.121 --> 20:56.648
Nobody's gonna be using that men's room
for quite a long time.

21:08.636 --> 21:13.802
Yakov, what's the point?
I can't make you understand.

21:14.376 --> 21:18.210
I just hope that someday you realize
that the people you met here...

21:18.380 --> 21:22.339
...who took advantage of you
are not representative of this country...

21:23.619 --> 21:26.986
...because in spite of all its faults...

21:27.156 --> 21:31.092
...most of us truly believe...

21:31.827 --> 21:33.852
...that America works.

21:36.231 --> 21:38.324
Most of the time.

21:39.168 --> 21:40.760
Harry.

21:40.936 --> 21:42.699
Harry!

21:43.972 --> 21:45.872
I'm right here, Yakov.

21:49.011 --> 21:50.535
Harry?

21:54.550 --> 21:56.040
Harry.

22:05.961 --> 22:09.158
The voltage commutator
must have tripped the emergency cutoff.

22:09.331 --> 22:11.629
We'll be dark for hours.

22:13.869 --> 22:15.735
Go figure.

22:17.941 --> 22:19.602
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

22:19.776 --> 22:23.405
- What happened?
- Someone gave me a lighter.

22:23.947 --> 22:27.110
Now if you'll excuse us, Yakov and I
are gonna go get cleaned up.

22:27.283 --> 22:31.014
<i>- Right, tovarish?
- Okay, buddy.</i>

22:31.588 --> 22:33.317
Your Honor...

22:33.556 --> 22:36.354
...don't you want me
to do something with him?

22:36.559 --> 22:39.357
No way, Jose.

22:41.097 --> 22:43.327
You had to be there.

22:51.007 --> 22:53.168
Pass the red stuff.

22:53.343 --> 22:54.742
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

22:56.246 --> 22:58.976
What did Yakov say
these crunchy things were?

22:59.215 --> 23:00.842
Toad something or other.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.247
Hey, Dan, help yourself.
There's plenty left.

23:06.422 --> 23:08.322
Dan, how you feeling?
