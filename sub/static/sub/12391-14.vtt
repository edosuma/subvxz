09:17.110 --> 09:17.906
I NEED TO SOLVE
THIS CASE QUICKLY,

09:17.940 --> 09:19.407
AND LOOK BRILLIANT
IN THE PROCESS,

09:19.450 --> 09:21.816
AND YOU NEED
TO HELP ME DO THAT.

09:21.850 --> 09:22.817
PLEASE.

09:22.850 --> 09:25.182
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TALKING
WITH YOU, DR. DOWNS.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.448
WELL, YOU MAKE QUITE
AN IMPRESSION, MR. GUSTER.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.889
AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.295
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

09:31.340 --> 09:32.932
AND ONCE AGAIN,
I WANT TO EXPRESS

09:32.970 --> 09:34.301
MY SINCERE CONDOLENCES.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.944
PERHAPS YOU COULD
GIVE MY OFFICE A CALL,

09:35.980 --> 09:38.175
AND WE COULD SET ASIDE
SOME TIME.

09:38.220 --> 09:40.188
HOW ABOUT MONDAY?

09:40.220 --> 09:41.619
TERRIFIC.
[laughs]

09:41.660 --> 09:42.922
GREAT.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.213
WE'RE DONE HERE.
GUS.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.717
THAN KS.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.752
(Shawn)
AND ANOTHER THING, DAD.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.428
JUST WHEN, EXACTLY,
WERE YOU A MEMBER HERE?

09:59.460 --> 10:01.189
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
SHAWN.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.997
I'M NOT A PART
OF THIS PLACE ANYMORE.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.361
AND WHETHER OR NOT
THIS WAS MURDER,

10:04.400 --> 10:06.834
YOU ARE HEREBY ORDERED
TO STEER CLEAR.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.633
THESE GUYS ARE NOT
TO BE MESSED WITH.

10:08.680 --> 10:13.811
I CANNOT POSSIBLY
BE MORE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.267
[Gus chuckles]
TUESDAY AT 11:00 IS PERFECT.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.302
I'LL BE THERE
WITH BELLS ON.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.001
OKAY.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.372
DUDE, WHO SAYS THAT?

10:27.420 --> 10:29.388
CLOSERS.
CLOSERS SAY THAT.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.980
WELL, IF BY CLOSERS
YOU MEAN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN,

10:32.020 --> 10:33.681
THEN, YES, I DO BELIEVE
I'VE HEARD THE PHRASE.

10:33.730 --> 10:34.697
ARE YOU FORGETTING

10:34.730 --> 10:35.697
THAT WE MANY HAVE STUMBLED

10:35.730 --> 10:36.867
UPON A MURDER TODAY?

10:36.900 --> 10:40.734
A MURDER THAT YOU'RE TAKING
ENTIRELY TOO UNSERIOUSLY?

10:40.780 --> 10:43.544
THE MAN'S NAME WAS
ARTHUR HOLMSTROM,

10:43.580 --> 10:47.050
AND HE DIED DURING
THE SACRED STAR CEREMONY.

10:47.090 --> 10:49.320
GET OVER HERE,
LOOK AT THIS.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.726
[man on computer]
BRINGER OF LIGHT...

10:51.760 --> 10:53.364
BY THE POWER OF...

10:53.400 --> 10:54.435
IT'S WEIRD.

10:54.470 --> 10:55.767
WEIRD?

10:55.810 --> 10:57.471
(Gus)
THOSE GUYS LOOK
DOWNRIGHT EVIL.

10:57.510 --> 10:58.704
WHITE MEN IN HOODS?

10:58.740 --> 11:00.105
(Shawn)
DUDE, THEY'RE VIOLET.

11:00.150 --> 11:01.310
(Gus)
THAT'S HOW IT STARTS, SHAWN.

11:05.020 --> 11:07.557
DO YOU SEE THAT?

11:08.970 --> 11:11.530
HOLY CRAP, SHAWN.
YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.334
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
SCARY LODGE GUYS.

11:19.590 --> 11:20.784
THEY'RE HERE FOR US.

11:20.820 --> 11:22.378
THEY KNOW YOU THINK
THEY KILLED THAT GUY.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.078
LASSIE.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.485
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:36.520 --> 11:38.488
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.124
WELL, HOPEFULLY
YOU'RE HERE TO HELP.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.718
GUS AND I WERE ABOUT
TO DO SOME SCRAPBOOKING.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.638
WE'LL NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN WORK
THE SCALLOPED SCISSORS.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.433
SPENCER, I GET WHY
YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE AN ASS

11:46.470 --> 11:47.539
AT MY STATION,

11:47.580 --> 11:48.979
BUT DO YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE THIS
IN YOUR OWN OFFICE?

11:49.010 --> 11:50.614
IT ENHANCES MY PERCEPTION.

11:50.650 --> 11:51.674
HOW ELSE WOULD I KNOW
THAT YOU CAME HERE

11:51.720 --> 11:55.451
BECAUSE YOU THINK
ARTHUR HOLMSTROM WAS MURDERED?

11:57.560 --> 12:00.632
NO ONE'S TALKING
DOWN AT THE LODGE.

12:00.670 --> 12:01.432
I WAS JUST DRIVING BY
THE OFFICE

12:01.440 --> 12:03.658
AND SAW THE LIGHTS ON.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.132
YOU WANT TO HIRE US.

12:05.180 --> 12:08.570
OH, COME ON, LASSIE,
IT'S NOT THAT TOUGH.

12:08.620 --> 12:09.712
LET IT GO.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.853
LASS, COME ON.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.528
LOOK AROUND--
YOU'RE IN A SAFE PLACE.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.027
SURROUNDED BY MEN

12:14.060 --> 12:15.049
WHO LOVE YOU.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.522
MM-HMM.
GUS.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.663
LASSITER,
I LOVE YOU.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.638
LOOK...

12:24.680 --> 12:26.113
YOU HAVE A CONNECTION
IN THERE.

12:26.150 --> 12:27.287
SO I NEED YOU
TO FEEL AROUND

12:27.320 --> 12:28.810
AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN
FIND OUT.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.555
THE DEPARTMENT'S
HIRING US?

12:30.600 --> 12:32.591
UH, NOT THE DEPARTMENT, ME.

12:32.630 --> 12:33.619
AND I CAN'T PAY YOU.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.309
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
WORTHWHILE.

12:36.340 --> 12:40.049
I GUESS THIS WOULD TECHNICALLY
BE CALLED A...

12:40.080 --> 12:42.787
FAVOR.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.117
MAYBE I COULD PAY
YOUR EXPENSES.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.287
DONE!
15 GRAND A DAY.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.957
WHEN WE'RE FINISHED,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.820
WE ALL GO FOR A PICNIC.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.304
THIS IS A DISCREET
INVESTIGATION.

12:52.340 --> 12:55.275
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

12:55.310 --> 12:56.777
SEE THIS?

12:56.820 --> 12:59.038
IT'S THE LODGE RADAR.

12:59.090 --> 13:00.341
AND LOOK AT THIS.

13:00.390 --> 13:04.656
IT'S ME...
FLYING UNDERNEATH IT.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.724
CAW !

13:05.770 --> 13:07.965
[squawking]

13:08.000 --> 13:09.103
NOW LOOK DOWN HERE.

13:09.140 --> 13:11.802
IT'S GUS.
HE CAN'T FLY.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.046
IT IS IMPERATIVE

13:13.080 --> 13:14.672
THAT YOU KEEP
A LOW PROFILE.

13:15.950 --> 13:18.953
(Dr. Nigam)
PLACE THE ROBE
ON OUR NEW BROTHER.

13:34.350 --> 13:37.422
GOOD JOB, WELCOME.

13:37.460 --> 13:38.825
VERY GOOD.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.862
THAT'S IT, HUH?
I'M OFFICIAL?

13:40.900 --> 13:42.709
NO BRIMSTONE?

13:42.740 --> 13:43.707
I DON'T HAVE
TO CRAB WALK

13:43.740 --> 13:46.174
OR GET TICKLED
WITH A FEATHER?

13:46.210 --> 13:47.939
COME ON, SOMEBODY, TICKLE ME
WITH A FEATHER--YOU.

13:47.980 --> 13:50.813
GENTLEMEN, TO THE BAR.
YES.
OH, YES.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.225
SAVE ME A SHOT.

13:58.940 --> 14:00.009
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ODD

14:00.040 --> 14:00.802
THAT IT'S JUST BUSINESS
AS USUAL

14:00.840 --> 14:02.899
WHEN SOMEONE DIED HERE
THE OTHER DAY?

14:02.950 --> 14:04.372
DEFINITELY.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.888
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH HE'S BEEN
ALL BUT FORGOTTEN. LOOK.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.081
HOLMSTROM'S ALREADY
BEEN MOVED.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.929
THOSE PAINTINGS
ARE IN ORDER OF RANK.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.825
ONCE THE HIGHMOST PATRIARCH
MOVES ON,

14:12.870 --> 14:14.997
HE'S REPLACED
BY THE NEXT GUY IN LINE.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.133
THAT'S IRVING PARKER.
RIGHT.

14:17.180 --> 14:18.943
HOLMSTROM WAS FIFTH
IN LINE.

14:18.980 --> 14:22.211
SOMEHOW HE LEAPFROGGED
THREE OTHER GUYS,

14:22.250 --> 14:24.980
INCLUDING PARKER
AND TWO OF YOUR DOCTOR BUDDIES.

14:31.540 --> 14:36.807

FOR KIDS"?

14:36.850 --> 14:37.976
3O "G"s FOR "TOYS FOR KIDS."

14:38.020 --> 14:40.386
15 GRAND FOR "CLOTHING
FOR KIDS"?

14:40.420 --> 14:42.285
THESE GUYS ARE
ULTRA-PHILANTHROPISTS.

14:42.330 --> 14:43.854
THEY'RE THE MOST
CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION

14:43.900 --> 14:44.958
IN THE CITY.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.127
WHY WOULD THEY
COMMIT MURDER?

14:47.170 --> 14:49.934
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS
FOR THE KIDS.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.112
OH...

14:57.150 --> 14:59.550
"THE SHROUD OF CHARLEMAGNE."

14:59.590 --> 15:01.126
DUDE, HOLMSTROM WAS
WEARING THIS HOOD

15:01.160 --> 15:01.797
THE DAY HE DIED.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.837
CHECK IT OUT,
IT'S 100 YEARS OLD.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.303
LIKE A LOT OF THE GUYS
AROUND THIS PLACE.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.479
[chuckles]

15:08.510 --> 15:10.046
SORRY.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.412
WHAT?
NOTHING.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.427
THANK YOU.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.893
OH, SHAWN.

FROM HIS OWN THIGH

DUDE, WHEN DID YOU HAVE TIME
TO MAKE ALL THESE SALES?

15:45.150 --> 15:46.310
WE WERE IN THERE
FOR AN HOUR.

15:46.350 --> 15:48.181
AN HOUR IS
ALL YOU NEED, SHAWN,

15:55.170 --> 15:58.298
YOU'RE CALLING ME A DAY AFTER
OUR FIRST DATE?

15:58.340 --> 15:59.637
YOU REALLY ARE

ONE DAY HE WAS FIFTH IN LINE
FOR THE JOB,

16:06.690 --> 16:08.692
THE NEXT DAY HE WAS
HIGHMOST PATRIARCH.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.960
OH, AND THE NEXT DAY
HE WAS DEAD.

IS SOMETHING GOING ON?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.207
LOOK, DO YOU HAVE
THE TOXICOLOGY REPORTS

17:20.240 --> 17:21.537
ON HOLMSTROM OR NOT?

17:21.580 --> 17:23.775
(Juliet)
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
INCONCLUSIVE.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.347
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE JUST STRANGE.

17:26.390 --> 17:27.414
STRANGE HOW?
OH, COME ON.

17:27.460 --> 17:28.779
[speaker phone on]

17:28.820 --> 17:30.253
WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE NATURAL CAUSES,

17:30.290 --> 17:31.826
AND HIS BLOOD HAD

17:31.860 --> 17:33.862
TRACE ELEMENTS OF...

17:33.900 --> 17:36.437
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO SAY.

17:36.470 --> 17:38.176
COME ON, O'HARA.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.303
WELL, IT HAD
WHAT LOOKS LIKE

17:40.350 --> 17:45.515
THE TOXIN SIMILAR TO THE VENOM
OF A BRAZILIAN VINE SNAKE.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.527
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.754
HE GOT BIT BY A SNAKE?
SHH!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.222
AM I ON SPEAKERPHONE?

17:49.270 --> 17:50.726
NO.
WELL, THEN, HOW DID HE HEAR--

17:50.770 --> 17:52.931
JULES, HOW 'BOUT
YOU JUST TELL US, HUH?

17:52.970 --> 17:54.733
WELL, HE DIDN'T HAVE
A MARK ON HIM.

17:54.780 --> 17:55.804
THERE WEREN'T
ANY PUNCTURE WOUNDS.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.319
THE ONLY THING HE HAD WAS
A LITTLE SKIN IRRITATION

17:57.350 --> 17:58.544
ON HIS FACE.

17:58.580 --> 18:00.582
OBVIOUSLY THESE RESULTS
ARE INCONCLUSIVE,

18:00.620 --> 18:01.587
SO RUN THE TESTS AGAIN

18:01.620 --> 18:03.520
BECAUSE WE NEED RESULTS
THAT AREN'T RIDICULOUS.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.584
I DON'T KNOW, LASSIE,

18:04.630 --> 18:06.325
I KINDA LIKE
THIS SNAKE IDEA.

18:06.370 --> 18:08.531
(Juliet)
WHY ARE YOU SHARING INFORMATION
WITH SHAWN

18:08.570 --> 18:12.245
ON A CASE WE HAVEN'T
HIRED HIM FOR?

18:12.280 --> 18:14.475
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT, O'HARA,

18:14.520 --> 18:15.475
[broken speech]
YOU--BREAKING--UHH.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.589
I CALL YOU BACK.

18:16.620 --> 18:17.609
[making static noise]

18:20.330 --> 18:21.558
NICE.

18:22.870 --> 18:25.839
YOU JOINED THE LODGE?!

18:25.870 --> 18:26.939
WHAT CAN I DO, DAD?
I'M A LEGACY.

18:26.970 --> 18:27.959
IT'S IN OUR BLOOD.

18:28.010 --> 18:28.999
DAMN IT, SHAWN,
I'M NOT KIDDING.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.598
YOU'VE GOTTA
RECONSIDER THIS.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.675
YOU GET A LOT OF POWERFUL
PEOPLE INTO ONE ROOM,

18:32.720 --> 18:34.017
AND DANGEROUS THINGS HAPPEN.

18:34.050 --> 18:36.757
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET THE POLICE
JUST DO THEIR JOB?

18:36.790 --> 18:38.519
I AM WORKING
FOR THE POLICE.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.629
SORT OF.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.991
IT'S A DISCREET INVESTIGATION.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.509
YEAH, DISCREET--
THAT'S ONE OF YOUR TALENTS.

18:42.540 --> 18:43.802
I'M WORKING ON A THEORY.

18:43.840 --> 18:48.311
ARTHUR HOLMSTROM WAS POISONED
WITH SNAKE VENOM.

18:48.350 --> 18:49.578
SNAKE VENOM.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.554
(Gus)
THE BRAZILIAN
VINE SNAKE.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.558
SPECIFIC TO REMOTE RIVER BASINS
IN NORTHERN BRAZIL.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.989
ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET
IN LENGTH.

18:55.030 --> 18:58.431
SO SOMEONE SNUCK
A THREE-FOOT SNAKE

18:58.470 --> 18:59.732
INTO THE LODGE
AND KILLED HIM

18:59.770 --> 19:01.374
DURING THE CEREMONY?

19:01.410 --> 19:02.274
THE PERFECT CRIME.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.372
RIGHT.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.911
EXCEPT THERE WERE NO MARKS LEFT
ON THE BODY.

19:04.950 --> 19:07.714
OH, SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR AN INVISIBLE SNAKE.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.559
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
THAT'S IT.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.320
RIGHT--RIGHT THERE.
THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM.

19:12.370 --> 19:13.689
MAYBE YOU'D BE BETTER OFF

19:13.730 --> 19:14.799
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN SEE.

19:14.830 --> 19:17.958
THERE IS A PECKING ORDER

19:18.010 --> 19:19.602
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES.

19:19.640 --> 19:20.641
OH, DAD, YOU'RE GONNA RUIN
MY DIAGRAM!

19:20.680 --> 19:22.682
[Shawn mutters]

19:22.720 --> 19:24.483
YEP,
WHO'S AT THE TOP, HUH?

19:24.520 --> 19:25.851
WHO'S THE NEXT GUY
IN LINE?

19:25.890 --> 19:27.699
I KNOW WHERE THE TOP IS,
YOU COULD HAVE JUST POINTED.

19:27.730 --> 19:29.618
NOW THERE'S COKE
ALL OVER EVERYTHING.

19:29.660 --> 19:32.732
FORGET IT.
JUST GROW UP.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.067
(Shawn)
ME GROW UP.

19:34.110 --> 19:36.749
A GROWN MAN MAKES
A CRAWLY SNAKE.

19:38.850 --> 19:40.010
THIS IS PARKER'S PLACE.

19:40.050 --> 19:42.450
I CAN SEE
THE SIGN, SHAWN.

19:42.490 --> 19:44.993
WELL, I BET THEY'RE
VERY BUSY INSIDE.

19:45.030 --> 19:46.793
MIGHT I SUGGEST
COMING BACK THIS EVENING

19:46.830 --> 19:47.899
AND BREAKING IN?

19:47.940 --> 19:49.567
GOOD IDEA.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.362
LET ME SEE WHAT I'M DOING

19:50.410 --> 19:51.900
FOR THE NEXT THREE
TO FIVE YEARS,

19:51.940 --> 19:53.771
WITH TIME OFF
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

19:53.810 --> 19:56.017
WE'RE HERE NOW.
I CAN GET US IN.

19:56.050 --> 19:58.484
WHOA...

19:58.520 --> 20:00.784
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU CAN JUST "GET US IN"?

20:00.830 --> 20:02.388
SHAWN, I'M TOTALLY
IN A SALES ZONE THIS WEEK.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.461
YOU LEAVE THIS
SECRET HANDSHAKE TO ME.

20:08.180 --> 20:11.047
I'M NOT SHOWING
AN APPOINTMENT, MISTER...

20:11.080 --> 20:12.069
GUSTER.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.678
BURTON GUSTER.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.223
AND THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE
WILLIAM ZANE.

20:16.260 --> 20:17.921
I'M AN OLD FRIEND,

20:17.960 --> 20:19.757
AND I'M JUST PAYING MR. PARKER
A BIRTHDAY VISIT.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.098
IT'S NOT HIS BIRTHDAY.

20:22.140 --> 20:25.109
I KNOW, IT'S MINE.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.040
WE'RE HERE
ON LODGE BUSINESS.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.480
THAT'S A TH RCEJIE-l RIGHT THERE.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.487
[Gus hits Shawn]

20:30.520 --> 20:31.612
WHAT?

20:31.660 --> 20:33.127
NOTHING BETTER TO DO
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?

20:33.160 --> 20:37.119
WELL, IT'S MY 29th, NOT ONE
OF THE IMPORTANT ONES.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.035
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN
YOU GET TO BE MY AGE.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.162
MM.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.077
[giggIeS]

20:42.110 --> 20:43.270
I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.277
I'LL JUST LET HIM KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.039
NO, NO NEED, DORIS.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.184
IT'S MY BIRTH DAY.
SURPRISE!

20:48.220 --> 20:51.257
[silently]

20:51.290 --> 20:52.518
YOU STILL NEED A SEVEN
RIGHT THERE.

20:52.570 --> 20:54.128
OH.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.797
BILLY?

20:58.910 --> 21:00.707
(Shawn)
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

21:00.750 --> 21:02.217
THAT'S YOUR SALES
REPTITU DE?

21:02.250 --> 21:03.911
IT COMES IN ALL FLAVORS,
SHAWN.

21:03.950 --> 21:05.178
IS SUCK A FLAVOR?

21:05.220 --> 21:07.222
[gasp5]
DUDE!

21:07.260 --> 21:09.922
THE WORLD'S
VERY FIRST CROCK-POT.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.131
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?!

21:14.170 --> 21:15.239
MR. PARKER,

21:15.280 --> 21:17.168
IT'S ME, SHAWN SPENCER.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.677
I'M THE NEWEST MONARCH,
REMEMBER?

21:18.720 --> 21:20.642
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.009
SO WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOING

21:22.060 --> 21:23.652
WANDERING AROUND
MY WAREHOUSE?

21:23.690 --> 21:26.090
THIS IS MY
VERY GOOD FRIEND GUS.

21:26.130 --> 21:27.939
HE'S LOOKING TO JOIN
THE MONARCH LODGE TOO.

21:27.970 --> 21:29.858
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.231
YOU KNOW,
HAZE HIM A LITTLE BIT.

21:31.270 --> 21:32.305
SOAK HIS HAND IN WARM WATER
WHILE HE'S SLEEPING,

21:32.340 --> 21:33.648
THAT SORT OF THING.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.874
DO YOU HAVE ANY SHEEP HERE?

21:34.910 --> 21:36.241
THIS IS NOT A LODGE.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.111
THIS IS MY PLACE
OF BUSINESS.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.388
AND THE FACT THAT
YOU SLID INTO MEMBERSHIP

21:39.420 --> 21:42.992
ON THE COATTAILS
OF YOUR TURNCOAT DAD,

21:43.030 --> 21:44.167
THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE
ANY FAVORS FROM ME.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.236
NOW I'M THROUGH
TALKING TO YOU NICELY.

21:46.270 --> 21:48.204
I WANT YOU TO TURN AROUND

21:48.240 --> 21:49.400
AND GET THE HELL OUT
OF HERE.

21:49.440 --> 21:53.809
RIGHT NOW!

21:53.850 --> 21:55.681
I'M SURPRISED
HE DIDN'T SAY "GOOD DAY."

21:55.720 --> 21:56.880
WHAT'S THAT?

21:56.930 --> 21:58.352
I SAID GOOD DAY.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.843
DUDE, DID YOU SEE
THOSE SHIPPING CRATES?

22:07.880 --> 22:10.075
IICCI," NAIF," "XAP."

22:10.120 --> 22:12.259
THOSE ARE AIRPORT CODES,
ALL BRAZILIAN.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.121
BRAZILIAN AIRPORT CODES?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.355
I LIVED IN AN AIRPORT
FOR A MONTH, GUS.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.867
THAT WAS TOM HANKS
IN THE TERMINAL.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.709
SAME DIFFERENCE.
WE NEED TO TALK TO LASSITER.

22:19.740 --> 22:20.900
NO, Y NEED TO TALK
TO LASSITER.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.771
I'LL DROP YOU OFF.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

22:22.810 --> 22:24.300
I HAVE APPOINTMENTS
WITH FOUR NEW CLIENTS.

22:24.350 --> 22:26.489
AND PRODUCT DOESN'T
SELL ITSELF.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.215
MAN...

22:33.330 --> 22:35.127
[Lassiter whistling]

22:35.170 --> 22:36.137
(Shawn)
LASSIE.

22:36.170 --> 22:37.137
ANYTHING?

22:37.170 --> 22:39.400
WELL, I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS,
AND I'VE GOT BAD NEWS.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.375
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE FOUND
A PRETTY SOLID SUSPECT

22:42.420 --> 22:43.387
ON THE HOLMSTROM MURDER.

22:43.420 --> 22:44.409
FINALLY.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.417
WELL, WHO IS IT?
LET'S GO GET HIM.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.155
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.

22:47.190 --> 22:49.158
(Parker)
THAT IS RIDICULOUS!

22:49.200 --> 22:50.224
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE, HUH?

22:50.270 --> 22:53.137
I'LL TELL YOU THIS,
I BETTER BE HOME FOR DINNER!

22:53.170 --> 22:56.173
HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL,
THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY!

22:56.210 --> 22:59.213
HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL!

23:02.560 --> 23:05.529
OH, NO.

23:05.560 --> 23:07.994
DO NOT GO DOWN
THAT ROAD.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.167
LOOK, I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT THIS EITHER, LASSIE.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.009
NOW THAT I'VE JOINED
THE LODGE,

23:12.040 --> 23:14.099
THAT MAKES YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW
MY BROTHER.

23:14.150 --> 23:16.948
WHICH MAKES ME
YOUR UNCLE...IN-LAW.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.116
IT'S GONNA GET
ESPECIALLY AWKWARD

23:18.160 --> 23:19.411
AROUND THE HOLIDAYS.

23:19.460 --> 23:22.349
SPENCER, YOU CAN'T
SERIOUSLY SUSPECT PARKER.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.527
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT SORT OF CHECKS OUT.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.333
IF IT WAS VENOM
THAT KILLED HOLMSTROM,

23:26.370 --> 23:27.928
IT CAME FROM A SNAKE
THAT ONLY SLITHERS

23:27.980 --> 23:29.902
IN A REGION WHERE PARKER
DOES HALF HIS BUSINESS.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.113
HE'S IN ROOM "A."
WHO'S GOING TO QUESTION HIM?

23:32.150 --> 23:33.549
I WILL.

23:33.590 --> 23:36.388
CARLTON, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

23:36.430 --> 23:38.898
YOU'RE RELATED.
IT'S AGAINST DEPARTMENT POLICY.

23:38.930 --> 23:41.069
O'HARA, QUIET.
I'M GONNA HANDLE IT.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.362
DON'T YOU DARE
TELL THE CHIEF.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.607
[telephone ringing]

23:44.640 --> 23:48.041
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.641
LASSITER'S DESK.

23:51.690 --> 23:54.557
IT'S YOUR WIFE.

23:54.590 --> 23:56.899
I MEAN YOUR EX-WIFE.

23:59.970 --> 24:02.109
HEY!

24:02.140 --> 24:05.246
YEAH, WELL,
IT SEEMS THAT IRVING

24:05.280 --> 24:06.588
IS KIND OF A, UM--

24:06.620 --> 24:09.009
WELL, HE'S A MURDER SUSPECT.

24:09.060 --> 24:09.981
YES.

24:10.030 --> 24:12.294
NO, THIS IS NOT BECAUSE
I WANT THE BARBECUE.

24:12.330 --> 24:14.628
I ALREADY GAVE YOU
THE GOLF CLUBS.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.035
SO HOW'D HE GO?

24:16.070 --> 24:18.106
NOT QUIETLY.

24:18.140 --> 24:19.471
YOU EVER MEET HIS WIFE?

24:19.510 --> 24:21.273
NO, AND IF SHE'S ANYTHING
LIKE HER DAD,

24:21.310 --> 24:22.345
I DON'T WANT TO.

24:22.380 --> 24:25.042
OKEY-DOKE.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.991
THAT SEEMS FAIR.

24:28.030 --> 24:30.590
O'HARA, PLEASE GO DOWN
TO THE ROOM.

24:30.630 --> 24:32.131
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.536
SPENCER, I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME,

24:34.570 --> 24:36.470
AND LISTEN CLOSELY.

24:36.510 --> 24:38.569
I KNOW IRVING PARKER
VERY WELL,

24:38.620 --> 24:40.747
AND HE WOULDN'T
KILL ANYONE.

24:40.790 --> 24:43.156
SURE, HE MIGHT
HOBBLE THEIR SPIRIT

24:43.190 --> 24:44.282
AND CRUSH THEIR SOUL

24:44.330 --> 24:45.592
AND DANCE
IN THE FLAMING ASHES

24:45.630 --> 24:46.597
OF THEIR BROKEN MARRIAGE,

24:46.630 --> 24:47.722
WHICH HE HAD A PART
IN ENDING.

24:47.770 --> 24:50.136
BUT HE WOULDN'T
KILL ANYONE.

24:50.170 --> 24:51.137
LOOK...

24:51.170 --> 24:53.047
HE'S THE ONLY SUSPECT
WE HAVE.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.048
HE TRIED TO HATE ME
TO DEATH.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.755
I KNOW IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL,
BUT IN A PRETTY BAD WAY.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.087
I KNOW, AND I'M GOING
TO GO TREAT HIM

25:00.130 --> 25:02.496
JUST AS I WOULD
ANY OTHER SUSPECT.

25:02.530 --> 25:04.066
BUT I THINK HOLMSTROM'S
MURDERER IS STILL OUT THERE.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.590
JUST--JUST WORKSHOP IT.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.234
DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO,
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

25:08.280 --> 25:12.216
IT ABSOLUTELY
CANNOT BE HIM.

25:14.350 --> 25:15.681
"WORKSHOP IT"?

25:18.230 --> 25:19.788
[voices inaudible]

25:35.490 --> 25:38.334
[whispering]
FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.204
I DON'T KNOW IF
REVERSE ENGINEERING THE CASE

25:42.240 --> 25:43.377
WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

25:43.410 --> 25:45.401
"DID ITS" WON 12-ZIP.

25:45.450 --> 25:46.587
BUT LASSITER SAID
HE WAS SURE

25:46.620 --> 25:48.212
THAT PARKER'S NOT OUR GUY.

25:48.260 --> 25:51.252
WELL, THE BOARD SEEMS
TO DISAGREE VEHEMENTLY.

25:51.290 --> 25:53.667
FINE, THEN LET'S
MOVE AWAY FROM HIM,

25:53.700 --> 25:55.463
AND CHECK OUT
THE OTHER LODGE MEMBERS.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.706
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT HOLMSTROM?

25:56.740 --> 25:59.777
HOLMSTROM.
WE KNOW HE'S DEAD.

25:59.810 --> 26:01.812
THAT'S A GOOD START.
I'M SERIOUS, SHAWN.

26:01.850 --> 26:03.112
I WAS IN THAT LODGE
MAKING CONTACTS.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.385
I KNOW.
YOU HAVE SALES REPTITUDE.

26:06.420 --> 26:08.923
NOW CAN WE PLEASE
RETIRE THAT EXPRESSION?

26:08.960 --> 26:10.791
TH ROW IT A PARTY,
PUT IT ON MEDICARE,

26:10.830 --> 26:12.297
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING
ANYMORE.

26:12.340 --> 26:13.568
NO, SHAWN,
WHAT I'M SAYING IS

26:13.610 --> 26:16.431
THOSE OTHER LODGE MEMBERS WERE
HARDLY OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.402
EVEN AS HOLMSTROM
LAY ON THE FLOOR,

26:18.450 --> 26:20.270
I WAS SHAMELESSLY
MOVING MY PRODUCT,

26:20.320 --> 26:21.844
AND NO ONE SEEMED
TO THINK ANYTHING OF IT.

26:21.890 --> 26:24.450
I'D SAY HOLMSTROM HAD
SOME ENEMIES.

26:24.490 --> 26:25.855
WELL, WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHO THEY ARE.

26:25.900 --> 26:27.720
AND HOW DO WE DO THAT?

26:27.770 --> 26:30.261
OOH, THERE'S SOMETHING
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

26:30.300 --> 26:31.676
WE HAVE TO DO FIRST.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.955
TOBIAS, I'VE HEARD THE CANVAS
ADDS TEN POUNDS.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.457
IS THAT ACCURATE?

26:41.490 --> 26:42.798
MAYBE YOU COULD PAINT
SOME ANGRY TIGERS

26:42.830 --> 26:46.596
OR A PUMA LAYING PROSTRATE
AT MY FEET.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.733
THIS IS A PORTRAIT
OF YOUR HEAD.

26:48.780 --> 26:50.304
I THOUGHT WE WERE HERE TO FIND
SOMETHING ABOUT HOLMSTROM

26:50.350 --> 26:51.772
WE ARE.
THIS IS FOR POSTERITY.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.310
DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE NEXT.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.318
HE DOESN'T GET ONE.
HE'S NOT A MEMBER YET.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.328
MAYBE WE COULD PAINT HIM
IN THE BACKGROUND OF MINE.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.918
PUT HIS HEAD
IN THE PUMA'S MOUTH.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.097
YOU'RE GOING TO IGNORE THAT.

27:00.130 --> 27:03.236
HEY, UH, WHY DID THEY TAKE
ARTHUR HOLMSTROM'S PAINTING DOWN

27:03.240 --> 27:04.935
SO QUICKLY?

27:04.970 --> 27:08.371
ALL OF HIS THINGS
WERE TAKEN OVER TO HIS HOUSE.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.783
SHH, SHH, SHH.
DO IT LIGHTLY.

27:35.030 --> 27:37.305
[bickering in whispers]

27:41.080 --> 27:43.719
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT
CREDIT CARDS AND PAPER CLIPS,

27:43.750 --> 27:46.412
SOMETIMES A DOOR
JUST NEEDS TO BE OWNED.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.688
THAT'S A SCREWDRIVER,
SHAWN.

27:47.730 --> 27:48.924
SCREWDRIVERS TOO.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.552
I THINK IT WAS
UNLOCKED.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.534
IT WAS NOT UNLOCKED.
I THINK IT WAS.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.765
THE DOOR WAS MOST DEFINITELY
NOT USNHLl-CIJCKED'

27:54.810 --> 27:56.505
GUS, THE MAN WAS A WIDOWER,
NOBODY'S HERE.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.007
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME USE
MY NEW CONTACTS

27:58.050 --> 27:59.415
TO GET THE INFORMATION?

27:59.450 --> 28:01.645
IS THAT HOW
WE DO THINGS, GUS, REALLY?

28:01.690 --> 28:03.351
WHY TALK TO SOMEONE
ABOUT HOLMSTROM

28:03.360 --> 28:05.453
WHEN WE COULD HAVE
HIS HOME OFFICE TELL US

28:05.500 --> 28:06.455
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW?

28:06.500 --> 28:09.594
HIS HOPES, HIS DREAMS...

28:09.640 --> 28:11.733
HIS LOVE
FOR THE LADIES.

28:11.780 --> 28:13.668
I THINK THAT'S HIS WIFE.
FACT:

28:13.710 --> 28:16.178
PEOPLE LIE,
STUFF DOESN'T.

28:16.220 --> 28:18.188
[loud bang]

28:18.220 --> 28:19.482
DID YOU LOCK
THE FRONT DOOR?

28:19.520 --> 28:20.487
YES, I LOCKED THE DOOR.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.623
I DON'T THINK IT WAS LOCKED.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.560
I KNOW I LOCK--
[glass shatters]

28:25.570 --> 28:27.709
BURN!

28:31.610 --> 28:32.872
NO.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.080
I JUST TRIED THAT.

28:37.130 --> 28:39.155
WELL, I DID IT
IN A DIFFERENT SPOT, SHAWN!

28:43.200 --> 28:44.565
HE'S COMING, HE'S COMING,
COMING, COMING!

28:44.610 --> 28:46.077
SHH, SHH, SHH!
OW!

28:46.110 --> 28:49.113
SHH!
WATCH OUT!

29:13.830 --> 29:14.865
[glass shattering]

29:19.640 --> 29:21.779
[whispering]
PEOPLE BREAKING INTO OFFICES--

29:21.820 --> 29:23.685
NO ONE RESPECTS ANYTHING
ANSHIEIDRE'

29:23.720 --> 29:24.709
YOU SHH.
SHH.

29:35.910 --> 29:37.002
OW!

29:41.750 --> 29:43.923
MY GOD, DID YOU SEE
WHO THAT WAS?

29:43.960 --> 29:45.154
IT'S HARD TO SEE ANYTHING
WITH SOMEONE'S KNEE IN YOUR EYE.

29:45.190 --> 29:48.694
IT'S YOUR OWN KNEE.
GET OUT OF HERE!

29:53.910 --> 29:56.811
WHOA...LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

29:56.850 --> 29:59.159
WHOEVER WAS HERE
WASN'T INVITED EITHER.

29:59.190 --> 30:01.249
A SECRET SAFE.

30:01.290 --> 30:02.382
DUDE, YOU GOTTA
GET US IN THERE.

30:02.430 --> 30:03.590
I CAN'T GET US
IN THAT SAFE, SHAWN.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.192
THAT'S A MARTIN 16.

30:05.230 --> 30:07.391
YOU'RE 36 MONTHS
INTO A SUBSCRIPTION

30:07.440 --> 30:09.704
TO MODERN SAFECRACKER
MAGAZINE-- WHAT'S THE POINT?

30:09.740 --> 30:11.002
I'M AN AMATEUR, SHAWN.

30:11.050 --> 30:12.142
WELL, IT'S TIME
TO GO PRO, FINGERS.

30:12.180 --> 30:15.149
FINGERS?
TWIST IT UP.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.290
WATCH OUT.

30:22.170 --> 30:24.104
[blowing softly]

30:28.250 --> 30:30.810
WOULD YOU STOP IT!?
SHH!

30:30.850 --> 30:32.386
NOW I'VE GOTTA START
ALL OVER.

30:36.130 --> 30:37.392
[knob clicking]

30:37.430 --> 30:38.966
THIS MONTH WOULD BE GOOD.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.262
SHH!

30:44.010 --> 30:45.910
IT'S NOT HAPPENING, SHAWN.

30:45.950 --> 30:48.089
TRY 36-24-36.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.087
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.758
JUST CLICK IT IN GENTLE.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.091
THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA.
NOW WHAT?

30:57.140 --> 30:58.232
HUH.

30:58.270 --> 30:59.476
I REALLY THOUGHT
I NAILED THAT.

31:02.780 --> 31:03.712
[chuckles]

31:03.720 --> 31:06.450
SHAWN,
YOU'VE REALLY GOTTA WORK

31:06.490 --> 31:08.287
ON YOUR ESTIMATING SKILLS.

31:08.330 --> 31:12.266
36-24...

31:12.300 --> 31:14.109
38.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.300
[lock clicks open]

31:15.340 --> 31:18.503
DUDE.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.438
YOU'RE A SAFECRACKING
MACHINE!

31:20.480 --> 31:22.948
I KNOW.
GRAB THAT.

31:25.260 --> 31:29.299
(Shawn)
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT $25,000
FOR KOMPUTERS FOR KIDS.

31:29.340 --> 31:32.377
THIS ONE SAYS 35,000.

31:32.410 --> 31:36.244
ONE OF THESE BOOKS
IS A FRAUD.

31:36.280 --> 31:40.558
DUDE, HOLMSTROM WAS
SKIMMING FUNDS FROM THE LODGE.

31:40.590 --> 31:43.866
AND LOOK, HE'S WRITING
IN SOME SECRET, ANCIENT CODE.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.289
NO, THIS ISN'T CODE,
THEY'RE ABBREVIATIONS.

31:46.340 --> 31:48.558
"HX" MEANS HISTORY,
"QD" MEANS EVERY DAY,

31:48.610 --> 31:50.202
"C" MEANS AND.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.400
"DEPOSIT HISTORY,

31:51.450 --> 31:52.417
"FOLLOW UP WITH ACCOUNTS
EVERY DAY,

31:52.450 --> 31:53.212
TRANSFER AND WITHDRAWALS."

31:53.250 --> 31:54.979
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU CAN READ THIS?

31:55.020 --> 31:56.157
OF COURSE I CAN.

31:56.190 --> 31:57.418
THIS IS DOCTOR'S
SHORTHAND.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.428
AND THIS IS DOCTOR'S
HANDWRITING.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.496
SEE THESE STICKY NOTES?
HOLMSTROM WROTE THESE.

32:01.530 --> 32:03.839
HE WASN'T SKIMMING,
HE FIGURED OUT WHO WAS.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.377
ONE OF THE DOCTORS
IS COOKING THE BOOKS.

32:06.410 --> 32:07.377
HOW SURE ARE YOU?

32:07.410 --> 32:09.014
85, 86%.

32:09.050 --> 32:10.347
WE'VE GONE ON MUCH LESS.

32:10.380 --> 32:14.885
LOOK, IRVING,
IT'S BEEN FOUR HOURS.

32:14.930 --> 32:16.488
IS THAT ALL?

32:18.500 --> 32:22.300
YOU KNOW, CARLTON,
IT MAY BE THE RAGE TALKING,

32:22.340 --> 32:24.376
BUT IF I HAD IT
TO DO OVER AGAIN,

32:24.410 --> 32:27.186
THE DAY MY TORY
CAME HOME WITH YOU,

32:27.220 --> 32:30.053
I WOULD HAVE TOLD HER TO
GO RIGHT BACK OUT THAT DOOR...

32:30.090 --> 32:32.251
AND COME BACK ALONE.

32:32.290 --> 32:33.359
THAT'S WHAT
I SHOULD HAVE DONE.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.526
ALL RIGHT, IRVING,
THAT'S ENOUGH!

32:34.570 --> 32:36.390
NOW, I LOVED VICTORIA,

32:36.440 --> 32:38.067
AND BECAUSE SHE LOVED YOU,

32:38.110 --> 32:40.977
I LET IT SLIDE THAT
YOU'RE A PAIN IN THE ASS.

32:41.010 --> 32:41.840
BUT YOU'RE AT MY TABLE NOW,

32:41.880 --> 32:43.416
AND AROUND HERE,
WE CALL SOMEONE LIKE YOU

32:43.450 --> 32:44.712
A HOSTILE WITNESS.

32:44.750 --> 32:46.559
IT'S A GOOD WAY
TO GET YOURSELF LOCKED UP.

32:46.590 --> 32:49.491
I CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE
A LIVING HELL,

32:49.530 --> 32:51.521
SO YOU BETTER GIVE ME
THE RESPECT I DESERVE.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.367
AND I SUGGEST
YOU CUT THE CRAP.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.129
CLEAR?

32:58.750 --> 33:02.117
I WANT A STRAIGHT ANSWER,
AND I WANT IT IMMEDIATELY.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.652
HOW DID ARTHUR HOLMSTROM ADVANCE
TO THE HIGHMOST PATRIARCH

33:05.690 --> 33:07.669
WHEN YOU WERE
THE NEXT IN LINE?

33:07.700 --> 33:11.158
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW ART
CONVINCED THE OTHER GUYS.

33:11.210 --> 33:13.508
HE ASKED ME,
AND I SAID IT WAS OKAY.

33:13.540 --> 33:16.475
HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE,
AND HE HAD HEALTH PROBLEMS.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.283
HE WAS GETTING WORSE.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.288
AND I GAVE HIM
THE ONLY CHANCE

33:20.320 --> 33:21.457
HE'D PROBABLY EVER GET.

33:21.490 --> 33:23.219
NOW, AS FOR
THE SNAKE BUSINESS,

33:23.260 --> 33:26.263
I HAVEN'T TRAVELED ABROAD
IN OVER THREE YEARS.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.267
I HAVEN'T BEEN
OUT OF THE COUNTRY

33:27.310 --> 33:28.334
SINCE YOU GOT MARRIED.

33:28.370 --> 33:30.679
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.
ARE WE DONE?

33:30.710 --> 33:33.611
WE'RE DONE WHEN I SAY
WE'RE DONE!

33:33.650 --> 33:36.448
WE'RE DONE.
YOU CAN GO.

33:38.630 --> 33:40.621
WE'VE BEEN
TO FOUR DOCTORS' OFFICES.

33:40.660 --> 33:42.537
NONE OF THE HANDWRITING
MATCHES THE BOOKS.

33:42.570 --> 33:44.629
PLUS, I PROBABLY CAUGHT
SOMETHING FROM SOMEBODY,

33:44.670 --> 33:46.706
AND I'M TIRED OF READING
HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN.

33:46.740 --> 33:48.776
THEY ALWAYS HIDE THE APPLE
IN THE BIKE.

33:48.810 --> 33:51.244
CAN YOU MAN UP, SHAWN?
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

33:51.290 --> 33:53.281
I'M ON AN UNBELIEVABLE
HOT STREAK RIGHT NOW,

33:53.320 --> 33:54.480
AND I'M NOT ABOUT
TO RUIN IT.

33:54.530 --> 33:57.454
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT
MOVING OOZING INFECTION GEL

33:57.500 --> 33:58.592
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FINDING A KILLER.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.508
HEY, MAYBE WE COULD PARK
ON A STEEPER INCLINE NEXT TIME.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.303
MY QUADS AREN'T
BURNING ENOUGH.

34:11.830 --> 34:14.719
(woman)
TELL HEATHER
TO CALL BACK TOMORROW.

34:17.270 --> 34:18.430
YES?

34:20.940 --> 34:22.771
GOOD AFTERNOON.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.380
I'M BURTON GUSTER,

34:24.420 --> 34:26.251
WITH CENTRAL COAST
PHARMACEUTICALS.

34:26.290 --> 34:27.257
WE'RE CLOSED.

34:27.290 --> 34:29.622
YES, WELL,

34:29.660 --> 34:32.197
I'M HERE TO DROP OFF
SOME PRODUCT TO DR. DOWNS.

34:32.240 --> 34:33.764
HE'S A BROTHER OF MINE.

34:53.740 --> 34:55.344
OW!

34:56.720 --> 34:58.847
HE ISN'T HERE AT--

34:58.890 --> 35:01.484
WELL, HE WAS EXPECTING ME.

35:01.530 --> 35:02.724
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR CARD.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.715
I JUST THOUGHT I'D DROP BY
AND PAY HIM A BIRTHDAY VISIT.

35:15.750 --> 35:19.720
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY,
THE BIG TWO-NINE.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.819
REMEMBER THAT ONE?

35:21.870 --> 35:24.304
I'M 26.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.739
REALLY?

35:30.380 --> 35:32.689
UH, SO...

35:32.720 --> 35:35.883
WILL DR. DOWNS
BE HERE LATER?

35:35.930 --> 35:38.421
I WILL MAKE SURE
HE GETS THIS.

35:50.820 --> 35:53.892
(Shawn)
AND LOOK, HE'S WRITING
IN SOME SECRET, ANCIENT CODE.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.413
DUDE!
I JUST SOLVED IT.

36:06.460 --> 36:07.427
CALL LASSIE.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.519
[cell phone rings]
O'HARA.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.788
RIGHT.

36:10.830 --> 36:13.139
13850 GRANADA.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.967
[engine roaring]

36:15.010 --> 36:18.798
[tires screeching]

36:25.560 --> 36:26.822
TO ABSENT FRIENDS.

36:26.860 --> 36:29.090
(all)
TO ABSENT FRIENDS.

36:29.130 --> 36:30.097
(Shawn)
ABSENT FRIENDS?

36:30.140 --> 36:33.007
LIKE ARTHUR HOLMSTROM?

36:35.010 --> 36:36.671
WHAT?

36:36.720 --> 36:38.142
MY SWEET VIOLET BROTHERS,

36:38.180 --> 36:40.978
WE CONGREGATE HERE TODAY
IN THE FLESH,

36:41.020 --> 36:44.126
NOT ONLY TO RECOGNIZE
OUR NEW HIGHMOST PATRIARCH,

36:44.160 --> 36:45.923
IRV PARKER,

36:45.970 --> 36:47.858
BUT ALSO TO BEAR WITNESS.

36:47.910 --> 36:50.572
ALONG WITH THE MAGIC HEAD
OF GUS,

36:50.610 --> 36:54.011
THE WISDOM OF BAUM...

36:54.050 --> 36:57.713
AND THAT...

36:57.760 --> 37:00.854
THAT STUFFED CREATURE.

37:00.900 --> 37:04.438
ARTHUR HOLMSTROM
WAS MURDERED.

37:07.550 --> 37:08.574
DUCK, DUCK,

37:08.610 --> 37:10.146
DUCK, DUCK,

37:10.180 --> 37:11.511
DUCK, DUCK, DUCK,

37:11.550 --> 37:14.212
DUCK, DUCK, DUCK...

37:14.260 --> 37:15.921
GOOSE!

37:15.960 --> 37:17.723
DR. ROGER DOWNS,

37:17.770 --> 37:21.809
ENTRUSTED WITH THE PROCEEDS
OF CHARITY ACTIVITIES,

37:21.840 --> 37:23.808
WAS FUNNELING FUNDS
INTO HIS OWN POCKET

37:23.840 --> 37:26.968
AND COVERING HIS TRACKS BY USING
A DUMMY ACCOUNTING LEDGER.

37:27.020 --> 37:29.181
NOW, WHEN HOLMSTROM DISCOVERED
THE CORRUPTION,

37:29.220 --> 37:31.279
HE CONFRONTED DOWNS
AND MADE A PLAY

37:31.320 --> 37:33.026
FOR THE HIGHMOST
PATRIARCH POSITION.

37:33.060 --> 37:34.891
IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SILENCE,

37:34.930 --> 37:36.739
HOLMSTROM GOT WHAT HE WANTED.

37:36.770 --> 37:39.876
BUT DOWNS STILL COULDN'T CHANCE
GETTING CAUGHT.

37:39.910 --> 37:42.549
AND SO HE KILLED
HIS OWN LODGE BROTHER

37:42.580 --> 37:44.946
RIGHT HERE
ON THE EYE OF HATHOR

37:44.990 --> 37:47.550
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LODGE.

37:47.590 --> 37:50.991
AND THIS IS
THE MURDER WEAPON.

37:51.030 --> 37:53.089
HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME?

37:53.140 --> 37:55.608
I AM A RESPECTED OFFICER
OF THIS LODGE.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.116
BY THE SHORES OF GITCHAGOOMEE,

38:01.150 --> 38:01.980
I CAN SEE YOU IN THE HOUSE,

38:02.020 --> 38:03.954
FRANTICALLY SEARCHING
FOR THE LEDGERS

38:03.990 --> 38:05.878
THAT HOLMSTROM KEPT
SECURELY STORED IN HIS SAFE,

38:05.930 --> 38:08.899
IRONICALLY,
TO KEEP YOU GOOD TO YOUR WORD.

38:08.930 --> 38:13.629
ARTHUR HOLMSTROM'S DEATH
WAS, UM, UNFORTUNATE,

38:13.680 --> 38:16.274
BUT I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

38:17.950 --> 38:20.111
CHECK IT OUT, LASSIE.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.082
I'M QUITE CERTAIN
YOU'LL FIND TRACES

38:22.130 --> 38:22.949
OF A POWDERED FORM

38:22.990 --> 38:25.720
OF THE VENOM
OF THE BRAZILIAN VINE SNAKE,

38:25.770 --> 38:27.294
NATIVE TO BRAZIL.

38:27.340 --> 38:29.001
IT'S PART OF AN ANTIVENOM

38:29.040 --> 38:31.907
THAT DR. DOWNS USES
IN HIS CHARITABLE WORK ABROAD.

38:31.950 --> 38:33.838
WHO KNEW
THAT IN SMALL DOSES

38:33.880 --> 38:35.188
IT ACTS AS A VACCINE,

38:35.220 --> 38:38.155
WHILE LARGER DOSES
ARE ABSOLUTELY LETHAL?

38:38.190 --> 38:39.418
(several lodge members)
I DID...I DID...I DID.

38:39.460 --> 38:41.394
REALLY?

38:41.430 --> 38:42.795
THIS IS ABSURD!

38:42.840 --> 38:45.001
HOLMSTROM DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.338
BY THE HALLS OF MONTEZUMA,

38:47.380 --> 38:49.974
I SEE YOU TAKING GREAT CARE

38:50.020 --> 38:51.146
TO PUT ON PROTECTIVE GLOVES

38:51.180 --> 38:53.683
WHILE LINING THE INSIDE
OF THE HOOD WITH THE POWDER

38:53.720 --> 38:57.190
FOR HOLMSTROM'S
PATRIARCH CEREMONY,

38:57.230 --> 38:58.959
MAKING IT DEADLY VENOMOUS.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.093
THE POOR OLD MAN'S
HEAD AND FACE

39:01.140 --> 39:01.936
NEVER STOOD A CHANCE.

39:01.970 --> 39:04.074
NOT TOO KEEN
ON THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH,

39:04.110 --> 39:04.678
ARE WE, ROG?

39:08.290 --> 39:10.781
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

39:10.820 --> 39:12.128
SPEAK TO MY LAWYER.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.128
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
DR. DOWNS.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.196
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.403
AND NONE OF THIS,
YOUR HIGHMOST,

39:18.440 --> 39:21.273
WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
WITHOUT THE INTREPID POLICE WORK

39:21.310 --> 39:23.949
OF ONE DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER,

39:23.980 --> 39:25.413
SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT'S OWN

39:25.450 --> 39:27.259
HIGHMOST PATRIARCH.

39:35.370 --> 39:36.974
NICE COLLAR, DETECTIVE.

39:37.010 --> 39:40.309
IT'S ALL IN A DAY'S WORK,
IRVING.

39:40.350 --> 39:42.489
YOU MAY NOT BE MY SON-IN-LAW
MUCH LONGER,

39:42.520 --> 39:44.181
BUT I'M THINKING

39:44.220 --> 39:46.256
YOU MIGHT BE A MONARCH YET.

39:46.290 --> 39:49.293
[applause]

40:00.120 --> 40:01.314
[knock'
ln
HEY! g]

40:01.360 --> 40:03.396
YOU READY TO GO?

40:03.430 --> 40:04.795
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY MEAN
BY THAT?

40:04.800 --> 40:07.030
OUR BIG WEEKEND, REMEMBER?
I CANCELLED, I FELT BAD.

40:07.070 --> 40:08.935
SO I JUST THOUGHT
WE'D GO THIS WEEKEND.

40:08.970 --> 40:11.074
OOH, DAD, WOW...

40:11.110 --> 40:12.975
I WISH YOU'D GIVEN ME
A LITTLE BIT OF ADVANCE NOTICE.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.045
I'M--I'M SWAMPED HERE.

40:17.220 --> 40:19.427
YEAH, RIGHT.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.121
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I'M GONNA GO.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.936
YOU WANT TO COME ALONG,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:23.970 --> 40:25.232
WHOA, DAD, WAIT A SECOND.

40:25.270 --> 40:30.014
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING THAT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.

40:30.050 --> 40:31.449
WHY DID YOU LEAVE
THE LODGE?

40:31.480 --> 40:33.550
LOOK, SHAWN,
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, LET IT GO.

40:33.590 --> 40:34.579
OH, COME ON, YOU BIG LIAR.

40:34.620 --> 40:35.587
TH ROW A LITTLE TRUTH
ON THE BARBIE,

40:35.630 --> 40:36.619
SEE IF IT STINKS.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.218
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:38.260 --> 40:39.397
I'M TALKING ABOUT
MAN CANDOR.

40:39.440 --> 40:40.896
LET'S HAVE SOME.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.158
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANT SOME MAN CANDOR.

40:43.210 --> 40:45.041
YOU WANT THE TRUTH?

40:45.080 --> 40:47.219
MY MARRIAGE WAS FALLING APART,
AND I MADE A CHOICE.

40:47.250 --> 40:48.387
I STOPPED CARING
ABOUT THE LODGE,

40:48.420 --> 40:50.285
BECAUSE I REALIZED
THE ONLY REAL MEMBERSHIP

40:50.320 --> 40:52.424
THAT MATTERED. . .WAS FAMILY.

40:52.460 --> 40:53.688
THERE.

40:53.730 --> 40:55.391
FAMILY?

40:58.010 --> 40:59.068
[strained chuckle]

40:59.110 --> 41:01.101
YOU REALLY EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT?

41:01.140 --> 41:03.244
[tapping on wall]

41:03.280 --> 41:04.918
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

41:04.920 --> 41:07.411
OH, THIS YOU GOTTA SEE.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.691
NICE ADDITION,
DON'T YOU THINK?

41:14.740 --> 41:18.107
WE GRABBED 'EM ON OUR WAY OUT
OF THE LODGE.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.573
WAY OUT?

41:19.610 --> 41:20.679
YEAH, GUS AND I DECIDED

41:20.720 --> 41:22.039
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BELONG
TO A CLUB

41:22.090 --> 41:23.284
THAT WOULD HAVE LASSITER
AS A MEMBER.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.705
YOU CAN HAVE YOURS
IF YOU WANT IT.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.469
NAH.

41:33.510 --> 41:36.638
NO, I THINK IT SHOULD STAY
RIGHT WHERE IT IS.

41:36.680 --> 41:40.514
THAT WAY I CAN ALWAYS
KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

41:40.560 --> 41:43.552
