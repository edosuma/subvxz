WEBVTT

00:22.374 --> 00:24.499
Hi, I'm Jeff Wilson,
assistant undersecretary

00:24.500 --> 00:26.629
of the Department of Homeland Security.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.049
I'd like to extend a warm
hello and welcome you

00:29.050 --> 00:31.449
to your Loner program
reprogramming program.

00:31.450 --> 00:33.449
Throughout this video, I'll be your guide.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.059
Just consider me your Loner program

00:35.060 --> 00:37.089
reprogramming programmer.

00:37.090 --> 00:38.869
By now, you have already received

00:38.870 --> 00:42.659
your very own Loner's
headband from your government,

00:42.660 --> 00:45.310
and are enrolled in automatic
billing for its rental.

00:46.570 --> 00:48.889
Just like a friend, your
headband will be gently

00:48.890 --> 00:51.359
reminding you, whether
through audible alarm

00:51.360 --> 00:53.600
or small electric shock, to abide

00:53.601 --> 00:56.409
by your new mandatory guidelines.

00:56.410 --> 00:59.369
Failure to do so may result
in immediate apprehension

00:59.370 --> 01:03.050
by a highly trained War
on Loneliness action team.

01:05.750 --> 01:09.469
The first step to recovery is
admitting you have a problem.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.749
That's why you'll be reporting to your

01:10.750 --> 01:12.569
weekly Lone-Anon meetings.

01:12.570 --> 01:14.529
In this cutting-edge group
therapy, you and your

01:14.530 --> 01:16.059
fellow loners will grow together,

01:16.060 --> 01:18.389
while participating in fun, and sometimes

01:18.390 --> 01:20.919
heart-wrenching growth exercises.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.629
So keep up the good work, America.

01:22.630 --> 01:24.649
Because, remember, you
wouldn't want a buncha loners

01:24.650 --> 01:26.700
out there wandering around by themselves.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.959
Good morning from our studios

01:34.960 --> 01:37.409
in Los Angeles, California.

01:37.410 --> 01:40.259
The president is once
again using the hashtag

01:40.260 --> 01:43.889
Label the Loners as the
nation's sixth mass shooting

01:43.890 --> 01:47.609
of the month is being reported
out of Cleveland, Ohio.

01:47.610 --> 01:50.849
The president posted
that all hashtag normals

01:50.850 --> 01:54.403
should remain vigilant
against hashtag headbanders.

01:55.550 --> 01:58.439
The Cleveland shooter, who
was not wearing a headband,

01:58.440 --> 02:01.086
was described by this
neighbors in this way.

02:01.087 --> 02:01.920
Don't say it.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.283
A quiet man
who kept to himself.

02:05.140 --> 02:09.249
Later in the hour, we will
interview agent Richard Delgado,

02:09.250 --> 02:11.723
head of the Los Angeles
Lone-Anon fusion...

02:13.000 --> 02:14.859
Hey, Mom, it's Lincoln, it's Lincoln.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.199
Yeah, I am still at the shoe store,

02:16.200 --> 02:17.649
and no, I have not been promoted, Mom.

02:17.650 --> 02:18.989
I need you to be my mom right now,

02:18.990 --> 02:20.229
I need you to be my friend.

02:20.230 --> 02:22.119
I need 100 friends at all times,

02:22.120 --> 02:23.319
and this morning I'm at 99.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.369
Yeah, no, the government needs me at 100,

02:25.370 --> 02:26.749
or I get in big trouble.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.569
Can you be my friend, please?

02:28.570 --> 02:31.023
All right, you got it,
Mom, all right, bye.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.557
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah ♪</i>

02:34.558 --> 02:36.382
<i>♪ I'm gonna show you what we did ♪</i>

02:36.383 --> 02:39.679
<i>♪ I'm gonna show you what we did ♪</i>

02:39.680 --> 02:43.347
<i>♪ What we're doing it right ♪</i>

02:55.840 --> 02:57.749
Good afternoon, Miss.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.719
You doing some shopping
at Giganti-Mart today?

02:59.720 --> 03:01.349
Unfortunately, yes.

03:01.350 --> 03:03.319
Target sighted.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.290
Pathetic headbander.

03:04.291 --> 03:06.319
Hey, let's teach him it's
wrong to dislike people

03:06.320 --> 03:07.473
by beating his ass.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.094
Hey there, friend.

03:18.725 --> 03:20.199
What the hell do you think you're doing?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.269
Tanner, right? I'm Frank.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.499
All right, that's okay,
great energy by the way.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.896
I'm gonna be working with you.

03:26.897 --> 03:29.279
The hell you are, I work alone.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.389
I own my own business.

03:30.390 --> 03:32.773
Oh yeah, no, yeah, they prefer

03:32.774 --> 03:34.213
that you don't do that anymore.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.197
What? Why me?

03:36.198 --> 03:37.198
Mm-hmm.

03:38.324 --> 03:40.209
Eh, how many loners does it take

03:40.210 --> 03:41.359
to screw in a light bulb?

03:41.360 --> 03:42.193
How many?

03:42.194 --> 03:43.549
One.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.349
You know, because,

03:45.350 --> 03:47.535
they got no choice.

03:47.536 --> 03:48.929
That's why they have the two rectangles.

03:48.930 --> 03:49.930
That's an I, man.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.170
What have we got here?

03:53.681 --> 03:54.681
Hmmm.

03:55.649 --> 03:59.249
Oh, gonna have to confiscate
this mace, naturally.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.389
Guess I'll just have to make
sure to not dress in a way

04:01.390 --> 04:03.229
to tempt any rapists.

04:03.230 --> 04:04.063
Well there you go.

04:04.064 --> 04:05.513
Here you go, read it.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.359
No, read the paper, don't look at me.

04:10.360 --> 04:14.469
Take your time, now, it
says you need a work buddy,

04:14.470 --> 04:16.988
so let's get to work, buddy.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.430
Right here.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.158
Come on, there we go.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.839
I don't really understand
the point of you searching me

04:21.839 --> 04:24.019
for weapons, considering
I'm about to walk into

04:24.020 --> 04:25.609
a store that sells guns.

04:25.610 --> 04:27.179
Wouldn't I just buy one there

04:27.180 --> 04:29.339
and shoot the place up anyway?

04:29.340 --> 04:31.339
That's how they get you?

04:31.340 --> 04:33.040
Let's get some fro yo, eh, guys?

04:34.170 --> 04:36.179
Come on, I'll catch up
with you guys in a sec.

04:36.180 --> 04:38.773
Fine, but I'll be back for you.

04:40.930 --> 04:41.930
Save money.

04:42.630 --> 04:43.630
Live good.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.729
You think I
could get a few bucks?

04:47.730 --> 04:48.730
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Thanks, Dad.

04:56.810 --> 04:58.269
Later.

04:58.270 --> 05:00.639
Hey, I'll tell you what,
call me a crazy kook,

05:00.640 --> 05:04.803
but I think I'm gonna really
enjoy whacking alongside you.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.053
Whack off, dude.

05:18.150 --> 05:19.163
Close your eyes.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.329
Turn around, 180 degrees.

05:31.610 --> 05:33.629
Good afternoon, sir, my name is Dabney.

05:33.630 --> 05:34.829
I just moved into the building.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.829
I just wanted to introduce
myself to everyone,

05:36.830 --> 05:38.043
make myself neighborly.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.929
Also, uh,

05:40.930 --> 05:44.929
I am required to inform
everyone in a 100-yard radius

05:44.930 --> 05:47.529
that I am a registered loner.

05:47.530 --> 05:51.439
And that you are encouraged
to knock on my door

05:51.440 --> 05:53.899
at any time, at which
point I will invite you in

05:53.900 --> 05:57.663
for pleasant conversation of
a mutually communal nature.

05:59.630 --> 06:02.557
Just need you to sign right there.

06:02.558 --> 06:05.019
What are you, some
kinda person-hating freak?

06:05.020 --> 06:06.292
Oh, I don't hate people.

06:06.293 --> 06:10.169
I just prefer to spend
my time alone, I suppose.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.183
Oh, so you think you're too good for me?

06:13.061 --> 06:14.628
Not at all.

06:14.629 --> 06:15.879
I'm sure you're terrific.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.269
You're what's wrong
with this fuckin' world.

06:23.270 --> 06:25.059
Hey, you got kids?

06:25.060 --> 06:26.040
No.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.523
Good, not allowed to live near children.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.299
There you go, I worked out extra hard

06:46.300 --> 06:48.129
for you this morning.

06:48.130 --> 06:49.133
It's asparagus.

06:49.990 --> 06:51.590
Had it for dinner and breakfast.

06:52.450 --> 06:53.310
You done?

06:53.311 --> 06:55.599
Agent Delgado,
in the year and a half

06:55.600 --> 06:58.179
since the inception of
the War on Loneliness,

06:58.180 --> 07:00.509
mass shootings have nearly quadrupled.

07:00.510 --> 07:02.079
I've been
closely collaborating,

07:02.080 --> 07:05.919
not only with Senator Difford,
but also General Earl Weller.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.959
We are all selflessly working to protect

07:07.960 --> 07:11.309
the American people and
their personal freedoms.

07:11.310 --> 07:13.339
Doesn't the
War on Loneliness rob

07:13.340 --> 07:16.729
so-called loners of
their personal freedoms?

07:16.730 --> 07:18.659
I wish you
could see the joy I see

07:18.660 --> 07:20.839
on loners' faces when their conversion

07:20.840 --> 07:23.569
to being a society-loving American begins.

07:23.570 --> 07:26.359
Truth is, they are relieved
when they are invited

07:26.360 --> 07:30.089
to explore their feelings with
our compassionate therapists.

07:30.090 --> 07:31.829
What are
the minimum requirements

07:31.830 --> 07:33.549
of a Lone-Anon group leader?

07:33.550 --> 07:35.369
Well it certainly
takes a big heart to care

07:35.370 --> 07:38.320
for people who may wish to
eliminate their fellow citizens.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.349
Just yesterday, I hired one of the most

07:41.350 --> 07:43.619
highly trained therapists
I've encountered.

07:43.620 --> 07:46.089
He is a true patriot, a
man who is willing to put

07:46.090 --> 07:49.499
every ounce of training
he has into guiding loners

07:49.500 --> 07:52.209
towards the day when they
finally return their headbands

07:52.210 --> 07:55.277
to the government and
rejoin the rest of society.

07:55.278 --> 08:00.278
Hello, my little grouplings.

08:02.345 --> 08:03.839
Who the hell are you?

08:03.840 --> 08:05.709
I'm Mike.

08:05.710 --> 08:08.209
I will be leading your group
today, and from now on.

08:08.210 --> 08:09.919
Where's Pam? We liked Pam.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.935
Pam never made us do things.

08:11.936 --> 08:13.549
We're not down with doing things.

08:13.550 --> 08:15.599
Tanner, I presume.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
And Ed.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.099
And Franny, the librarian.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.289
You can stock my shelves any time.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.113
No, Franny, inappropriate.

08:25.530 --> 08:28.749
I can't wait to get to know
everything about you all,

08:28.750 --> 08:29.720
three times a week.

08:29.720 --> 08:30.553
Three times a week?

08:30.554 --> 08:32.669
We're only supposed to
meet once a week, Mike.

08:32.669 --> 08:36.549
Lincoln Chalk, you little rascal.

08:36.549 --> 08:40.389
We're gonna have some
fun - three times a week.

08:40.390 --> 08:43.107
And I spy with my little eye,

08:44.090 --> 08:45.809
Clara

08:45.810 --> 08:47.869
and Dabney

08:47.870 --> 08:51.179
and Jeremy. What up, J-Mizzle?

08:51.180 --> 08:52.699
Okay, let's circle up.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.750
Campfire-style, boys and girls, let's go.

08:55.590 --> 08:57.140
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle.

09:02.950 --> 09:06.869
Now, before the fun can
begin, a few ground rules.

09:06.870 --> 09:10.773
First, this is a place
of acceptance and love.

09:12.380 --> 09:16.904
Second rule, all cellphones,
tablets and similar devices

09:16.905 --> 09:19.449
are not allowed at any time.

09:19.450 --> 09:20.667
What the hell, man?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.269
That was your face.

09:26.270 --> 09:30.089
Third rule, there's no judgment here.

09:30.090 --> 09:31.723
We are here to share.

09:32.620 --> 09:33.779
To open up.

09:33.780 --> 09:37.299
To commune with others.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.609
Now, none of those things happen

09:39.610 --> 09:41.099
when we put up walls

09:41.100 --> 09:43.349
and force our own agenda on other people.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.929
So if I choose to ignore all this

09:45.930 --> 09:47.729
and walk on out the door?

09:47.730 --> 09:50.230
You'll be violently
apprehended, and imprisoned.

10:00.920 --> 10:05.920
Okay, let's jump right in with
some socializing exercises.

10:06.650 --> 10:09.379
First one to hug me gets a Shasta.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.609
Mark my words, my little grouplings.

10:11.610 --> 10:15.049
Studies have shown that
people who deny themselves

10:15.050 --> 10:18.979
human contact are prone to
serious health problems,

10:18.980 --> 10:21.729
such as cardiovascular disease,

10:21.730 --> 10:23.729
altered brain function

10:23.730 --> 10:26.029
and the early onset of senility.

10:26.030 --> 10:29.971
Sure, loneliness isn't a
controlled substance that can be

10:29.972 --> 10:34.019
rolled up and smoked, or
chopped up and snorted.

10:34.020 --> 10:36.919
No, it's not a party drug.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.859
But let's face it, if it were,

10:38.860 --> 10:41.259
none of you would know because
you don't go to parties.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.479
But don't be fooled.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.739
It's just as dangerous as any substance

10:45.740 --> 10:47.239
that can be heated in a spoon

10:47.240 --> 10:49.220
and injected into your scrotum.

10:49.221 --> 10:51.189
Wow, this is a real wake-up call.

10:51.190 --> 10:52.140
We need results.

10:52.141 --> 10:53.499
We don't have any.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.644
The mass shootings haven't
lessened in the least.

10:56.645 --> 10:58.099
Solid facts are only
gonna confuse the issue.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.100
We need a victory.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.319
One big, shining public example

11:05.320 --> 11:06.889
that the program is succeeding.

11:06.890 --> 11:08.739
Is there something we can
with all those cockroaches

11:08.740 --> 11:10.499
we implanted with microchips?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.075
General.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.910
Anything else, sir?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.089
Who are you?

11:25.090 --> 11:26.443
I'm the new page, sir.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.949
What's your name?

11:28.950 --> 11:30.283
Paige, sir.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.729
You in for poker?

11:39.730 --> 11:41.230
Dude, he's right over there.

11:42.550 --> 11:43.383
We got to know.

11:43.384 --> 11:45.019
If we don't have six, there's no point

11:45.020 --> 11:46.320
in the rest of us meeting.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.703
Yeah, fine, I'm in.

11:55.230 --> 11:57.623
Splendid, see you at poker.

11:59.460 --> 12:02.003
You're a fucking genius.

12:03.660 --> 12:05.319
Do you remember when we
used to run surveillance

12:05.320 --> 12:08.719
on drug rings and terrorist cells?

12:08.720 --> 12:10.009
Those were the days.

12:10.010 --> 12:11.723
Just don't know what's happened to us.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.983
There's target four in sight, copy.

12:16.581 --> 12:17.872
He's looking right at us.

12:17.873 --> 12:20.429
Is he looking at the van?

12:20.430 --> 12:23.119
Abort, abort, get outta there.
Or the whole thing's blown.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.026
Where are the keys?

12:24.027 --> 12:25.608
They're in the ignition, you idiot.

12:25.609 --> 12:26.467
Why are they in the
ignition, that makes no...

12:26.468 --> 12:28.084
Because they make the car go.

12:28.085 --> 12:30.650
It's too late, just stay there!

12:43.482 --> 12:44.482
Ohhh.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.913
Target five is in sight.

12:55.956 --> 12:57.799
Federal government.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.963
It's open, Lincoln.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.549
That coulda been the
federal government, for real.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.550
It's open.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.839
We're getting sloppy.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.832
Hey, gang, we're safe if
any small fires break out.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.533
A big wet blanket just walked in.

13:12.730 --> 13:15.239
I'm trying to hold us together, Ed.

13:15.240 --> 13:18.499
There's no poker table set
up, people are reading books.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.412
I mean, what if we get
raided, what are we gonna say?

13:20.413 --> 13:22.629
You are welcome to
throw down a buncha cards

13:22.630 --> 13:24.019
and some playing chips if you wanna,

13:24.020 --> 13:26.029
but you got to clean 'em up.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.999
Let's just hurry up and do this.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.209
Got a hot date?

13:29.210 --> 13:30.210
Maybe.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.483
Assume the positions.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.509
Come on, big boy.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.510
Today.

13:41.650 --> 13:44.227
Timer starts now.

13:47.311 --> 13:48.144
I just wish you hadn't slept

13:48.145 --> 13:49.579
with the boss' wife, you know.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.529
Then maybe we'd be on a better assignment.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.129
She slept with me.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.333
How many times do I have
to paint the picture?

13:56.506 --> 13:57.746
I didn't know she was the boss'

13:59.280 --> 14:01.706
Wife.
Wife, wife.

14:19.864 --> 14:21.531
That's a long sip.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.810
And that's time.

14:24.811 --> 14:26.339
Now we're just all
leaving in a group, huh?

14:26.340 --> 14:27.909
I'm sorry, were we all supposed to take

14:27.910 --> 14:29.609
the secret exit into the steam tunnels?

14:29.610 --> 14:32.299
What happened to staggering the exits?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.133
I'm telling you, we are getting very...

14:33.133 --> 14:33.966
Sloppy?

14:33.966 --> 14:34.870
...sloppy, yes,

14:34.871 --> 14:36.759
and sooner or later, we're
gonna hear that sound

14:36.760 --> 14:38.413
that we are all dreading.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.356
Go.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.855
It's gonna sound like that.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.963
You should go out the back door.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.313
Dabney, you better hide.

15:09.746 --> 15:11.829
It's open, you fuck-tard.

15:12.925 --> 15:13.925
Go go go.

15:16.630 --> 15:18.989
Is there anyone else in
the apartment, ma'am?

15:18.990 --> 15:20.429
What are the charges?

15:20.430 --> 15:22.289
As a suspected terrorist
and enemy of the state,

15:22.290 --> 15:25.439
we're not required to
inform you of the charges.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.440
All right.

15:27.214 --> 15:28.564
Then help me up, sonny boy.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.120
Eat shit.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.049
Hurry up and
get her ass out of here

15:35.050 --> 15:36.989
before the paralysis wears off.

15:36.990 --> 15:38.049
Make sure the headband stays on,

15:38.050 --> 15:40.609
in case I need to deliver another shock.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.002
Crazy old bat.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.489
Shred this, we'll
destroy all evidence as we go.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.659
It's go time.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.710
Initiate Operation Ten Tango.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.279
You have something for me?

16:04.280 --> 16:06.169
I'm looking at
treason charges here.

16:06.170 --> 16:08.139
You'll be compensated
an amount commensurate

16:08.140 --> 16:11.320
to the value of the
information you provide.

16:11.321 --> 16:12.260
I wanna work with you.

16:12.261 --> 16:13.510
I work alone.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.529
The plan is underway.

16:16.530 --> 16:18.619
What's the plan?

16:18.620 --> 16:20.009
I don't know yet.

16:20.010 --> 16:23.019
But without me, you
likely never will either.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.489
Okay, hand me your cellphone.

16:24.490 --> 16:25.490
Hmm?

16:25.490 --> 16:26.490
Cellphone.

16:28.297 --> 16:29.297
Oh, what, oh.

16:30.070 --> 16:33.359
Exit the vehicle, walk to
the Swedish furniture store,

16:33.360 --> 16:36.769
purchase the Flard Flard patio set.

16:36.770 --> 16:38.179
Why?

16:38.180 --> 16:40.209
So we have a reason to
be in this parking lot.

16:40.210 --> 16:42.179
I don't even have a patio.

16:42.180 --> 16:45.509
Swedish furniture - simple,
elegant, easy to assemble.

16:45.510 --> 16:47.463
Remember, get the Flard Flard.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.839
I'll review this information.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.113
If I require your future assistance,

16:54.660 --> 16:56.093
I'll be in contact.

17:00.427 --> 17:01.452
Flard Flard.

17:01.453 --> 17:02.620
Flard Flard.

17:14.900 --> 17:15.900
It's begun.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.989
Introvert, a word that
is not really all that

17:27.990 --> 17:31.563
dissimilar from the word pervert.

17:32.570 --> 17:36.219
Now, am I suggesting in
the eyes of the Holy Father

17:36.220 --> 17:38.833
that introverts are perverts?

17:41.860 --> 17:44.479
I would not presume to know

17:44.480 --> 17:46.833
the opinion of the Holy
Father on the matter.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.559
Nor does the Good Book...

17:49.560 --> 17:51.302
Clara being taken away had nothing to do

17:51.303 --> 17:53.146
with poker night, or we'd all be with her.

17:53.147 --> 17:55.929
Well something sure got
their attention, didn't it?

17:55.930 --> 17:58.443
But does that mean it is not a sin?

17:59.650 --> 18:00.984
No.

18:00.985 --> 18:01.900
We'll talk during the break,

18:01.901 --> 18:03.179
unless the break gets us first.

18:03.180 --> 18:06.199
Is it curable? Yes.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.568
That doesn't make any sense.

18:07.569 --> 18:08.877
Shh.
Shh.

18:12.030 --> 18:16.159
All things are possible
by the grace of God.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.669
In closing, let me implore you all,

18:19.670 --> 18:20.853
make a friend.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.883
Or burn in hell.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.563
Christ be with you.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.049
Thank you, brother.

18:33.050 --> 18:34.369
Father.

18:34.370 --> 18:35.370
Cool.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.299
Our next guest speaker,
who will enlighten you all

18:40.300 --> 18:42.839
on the basics of small
talk, isn't here yet.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.703
So let's take this time
to welcome a new member.

18:49.410 --> 18:50.410
Thank you.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.873
Um, hi.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.393
My name is Senise.

19:02.860 --> 19:03.860
Um,

19:05.380 --> 19:08.979
aren't you all supposed to
say, you know - Hi, Senise?

19:08.980 --> 19:11.052
Oh, that'll be covered in
the small talk instructional.

19:11.053 --> 19:12.017
Just go on.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.017
Oh, okay.

19:15.090 --> 19:17.619
Well, I guess

19:17.620 --> 19:19.083
all I can say is,

19:20.210 --> 19:21.210
I

19:22.270 --> 19:24.593
Honestly have no idea why I'm here.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.209
I have a lot of friends,
and people like me,

19:30.210 --> 19:32.560
and I like them, so

19:33.400 --> 19:38.400
this feels like some kind
of sick, horrible mistake,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.283
to be kind of honest.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.140
You all freak me out a little bit.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.560
To be completely honest,
you all freak me out a lot.

19:50.510 --> 19:51.510
Um,

19:53.969 --> 19:55.477
thanks.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.079
Welcome, newbie.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.379
Oh, ha, thank you.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.430
Keep your eyes open and your head down,

20:34.754 --> 20:36.744
and you'll be all right.

20:36.745 --> 20:37.745
O-Kay.

20:39.410 --> 20:40.410
Thanks, uh.

20:43.730 --> 20:47.779
That was a visual cue for
you to tell me your name.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.689
The small talk guy just covered that.

20:50.690 --> 20:52.169
Jeremy.

20:52.170 --> 20:53.429
Great.

20:53.430 --> 20:55.879
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.973
In the meantime, remember,

20:58.960 --> 21:01.593
there are ears in the
walls and eyes in the sky.

21:10.630 --> 21:12.519
They didn't tell her why
they were taking her away.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.520
They just did.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.629
Clearly, we can't meet anymore, okay?

21:17.630 --> 21:20.079
Yeah, well, clearly,
you're a butthole, okay?

21:20.080 --> 21:21.609
Don't ever talk to me again.

21:21.610 --> 21:24.097
Tanner's right, you're a butthole.

21:24.098 --> 21:25.098
But listen,

21:26.480 --> 21:28.949
if they suspect anything
and they're watching us,

21:28.950 --> 21:31.679
we're better off sticking to our routine.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.279
Besides, think of the alternative

21:33.280 --> 21:34.749
if we don't have our poker nights.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.939
Okay, so which one of
you geniuses would like

21:36.940 --> 21:38.849
to volunteer your abode for meetings?

21:38.850 --> 21:41.439
Considering what happened to
the last person who did so.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.919
And also, there's the little
matter of replacing Clara

21:43.920 --> 21:45.913
in the group, remember?

21:45.914 --> 21:47.962
Are we sure it has to be six people?

21:47.963 --> 21:50.413
It won't work otherwise,
we don't have a choice.

21:51.660 --> 21:54.189
Jeremy's out, clearly.

21:54.190 --> 21:55.609
Dude's crazy.

21:55.610 --> 21:57.669
I know you can hear me.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.679
I can hear you.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.313
We can't afford to be picky.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.549
We either need someone
we can trust completely.

22:04.550 --> 22:05.550
Not gonna happen.

22:05.551 --> 22:08.889
Or, someone so naive they'll
never know we're using them.

22:08.890 --> 22:10.633
Excuse me, everyone.

22:11.870 --> 22:13.319
I'm not familiar with the area.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.169
Does anyone know of a
good sushi restaurant

22:16.170 --> 22:17.658
in the neighborhood?

22:21.710 --> 22:22.913
Why won't you leave me alone?

22:36.200 --> 22:37.239
Hi.

22:37.240 --> 22:38.593
That's a code knock.

22:39.913 --> 22:41.919
Everyone else is waiting outside.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.470
We're staggering the entrances.

22:46.939 --> 22:49.409
What is wrong with you people?

22:49.410 --> 22:51.299
Stagger the entrances.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.449
We discussed that.

22:52.450 --> 22:54.463
We decided it's fucking stupid.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.633
Hi, everyone.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.669
I have to say I'm very intrigued by this

23:03.670 --> 23:05.499
staggering the entrances concept.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.500
That is

23:07.340 --> 23:08.340
weird.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.673
Whoa, my Philo Puffs.

23:16.570 --> 23:18.320
I can't believe we're doing this.

23:19.270 --> 23:20.729
As long as we're careful, we'll be fine.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.979
But we haven't been
careful, we've been terribly...

23:23.980 --> 23:24.970
Sloppy.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.539
I was going to say careless.

23:26.540 --> 23:27.799
What are you guys talking about?

23:27.800 --> 23:29.539
It's not bad, don't worry.

23:29.540 --> 23:30.840
So it's nothing illegal.

23:33.135 --> 23:34.859
Uh, yeah, it's illegal.

23:34.860 --> 23:36.769
But it's not unethical.

23:36.770 --> 23:39.239
It's kind of like taking disability

23:39.240 --> 23:40.889
for a self-inflicted injury.

23:40.890 --> 23:42.399
How is that not unethical?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.609
Technically, we're breaking
the law just by being here.

23:44.610 --> 23:46.579
The feds don't any more than two loners

23:46.580 --> 23:47.639
to be alone at any time.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.819
They're afraid that
sleeper cells of introverts

23:49.820 --> 23:51.499
are gonna form and plan attacks.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.719
Is that what you're doing?

23:52.720 --> 23:55.779
Of course not, that lovely
headband you're wearing

23:55.780 --> 23:57.919
tracks a physical
proximity to other people

23:57.920 --> 23:59.699
on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.059
There's a quota.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.549
If you don't meet it,
the government will know.

24:03.550 --> 24:06.009
Naturally no one
knows what the quota is.

24:06.010 --> 24:08.079
We only know when your headband goes off.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.955
And that's usually in
the middle of the night,

24:09.956 --> 24:11.419
and then you have to hurry
outside in your underwear

24:11.420 --> 24:13.439
to a bus stop and stand next to a stranger

24:13.440 --> 24:14.529
until it shuts off.

24:14.530 --> 24:19.049
That happens too many
times, they take you away.

24:19.050 --> 24:20.269
Somewhere.

24:20.270 --> 24:21.240
Somewhere?

24:21.241 --> 24:23.969
A little island off the
coast of North Carolina,

24:23.970 --> 24:26.109
or an abandoned zoo in Utah.

24:26.110 --> 24:27.359
Or some caves in the Rockies.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.309
You don't come back.

24:29.310 --> 24:32.699
They say, instead of
solitary confinement,

24:32.700 --> 24:34.809
they chain you up to someone else

24:34.810 --> 24:38.379
for the rest of your life, 24 hours a day.

24:38.380 --> 24:41.789
But, we found a way
to trick the headbands.

24:41.790 --> 24:42.919
Ed's son hacked the government's

24:42.920 --> 24:44.349
War on Loneliness database.

24:44.350 --> 24:47.556
Could we leave the illegal
activity of my son out of this?

24:47.557 --> 24:49.909
And he found out that a
group of six people sitting

24:49.910 --> 24:51.609
in close proximity for two hours a week

24:51.610 --> 24:53.760
will negate the need
for any other contact.

24:55.270 --> 24:57.963
So, we need to sit here for two hours?

25:02.240 --> 25:04.899
Physical contact cuts the time in half.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.379
And you all do this
just to get outta being

25:07.380 --> 25:08.789
around people for the rest of the week?

25:08.790 --> 25:10.849
If we had known you were
going to insist on being

25:10.850 --> 25:12.849
sociable, we never would have invited you.

25:12.850 --> 25:14.909
I don't wanna be a part of this.

25:14.910 --> 25:17.043
Oh, I think you're already complicit.

25:18.270 --> 25:20.259
I think I need to think
about this for a bit.

25:20.260 --> 25:21.483
How about for an hour?

25:22.590 --> 25:24.677
58 minutes should do it, starting now.

26:35.065 --> 26:36.369
Fine.

26:36.370 --> 26:38.549
It appears I have no choice.

26:38.550 --> 26:39.863
But I do have some rules.

26:40.740 --> 26:43.209
It would certainly be a
lot easier to convince

26:43.210 --> 26:45.169
the authorities that we
were having a weekly game

26:45.170 --> 26:47.659
of friendly poker if we were, you know,

26:47.660 --> 26:48.679
actually friendly.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.759
That's what we're
working so hard to avoid.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.609
Okay, you all may have given up,

26:52.610 --> 26:54.519
but I for one am not just gonna sit here

26:54.520 --> 26:56.229
and wait for the police
to knock on my door

26:56.230 --> 26:58.219
and take me away to, somewhere.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.349
It's not the police.

27:00.350 --> 27:01.689
Way scarier, and they don't knock,

27:01.690 --> 27:02.890
they just bust right in.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.200
How do you know that?

27:07.413 --> 27:08.549
I didn't say anything that time.

27:08.550 --> 27:09.550
Oh my God.

27:10.870 --> 27:12.259
Wait a minute.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.959
You said it takes six people,

27:14.960 --> 27:17.830
and you obviously have been
doing this for a while, so

27:19.060 --> 27:20.809
who am I replacing?

27:20.810 --> 27:22.309
Her name was Clara.

27:22.310 --> 27:24.089
You kick me, you die.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.040
And what did she do to be taken away?

27:33.080 --> 27:35.139
Okay, you know, I don't need this.

27:35.140 --> 27:37.319
I have friends, I don't
need to sit in a circle

27:37.320 --> 27:39.099
with a buncha social rejects touching

27:39.100 --> 27:40.579
each other to meet my quota.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.029
If you want me to stick my neck out,

27:42.030 --> 27:43.249
we play by my rules.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.972
Starting tomorrow, and I
don't care how long it takes,

27:45.973 --> 27:47.589
we will learn enough about each other

27:47.590 --> 27:48.699
to make this a kosher.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.799
Oh, come on.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.823
Those are my terms.

27:55.678 --> 27:56.678
That's time.

27:57.380 --> 27:58.380
That was fun.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.447
This is all very general.

28:04.448 --> 28:05.586
You know their plan.

28:05.587 --> 28:07.239
Doesn't help very much.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.399
Thanks to me, we've already

28:09.400 --> 28:11.959
identified six possible targets.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.399
Now we just need to narrow it down.

28:13.400 --> 28:17.077
What we need to know is
exactly who and exactly when.

28:17.078 --> 28:18.481
All right.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.827
I am gonna be reimbursed for those, right?

28:34.478 --> 28:36.043
Yeah, just fill out the form.

28:47.636 --> 28:49.669
So.
So.

28:49.670 --> 28:52.963
Why don't we just start with
a little small talk, okay?

28:53.807 --> 28:54.939
What do you do for a living?

28:54.940 --> 28:57.938
I work in the IT department
of a large corporation.

28:57.939 --> 28:58.772
Oh.

28:58.773 --> 29:00.029
You work in a library?

29:00.030 --> 29:01.569
You work here?

29:01.570 --> 29:03.559
I didn't know they still had libraries.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.989
Did you ever?

29:04.990 --> 29:06.039
What's that supposed to mean?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.319
Have you ever read a book?

29:07.320 --> 29:08.290
You mean a whole one?

29:08.291 --> 29:10.062
Yes, a whole book.

29:10.063 --> 29:13.379
A History of the Integration
of Professional Baseball.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.289
Have you ever watched
a whole baseball game?

29:15.290 --> 29:16.906
You have a son?

29:16.907 --> 29:18.507
I don't wanna talk about that.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.719
Okay.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.909
The other part of my day
usually consists of making sure

29:23.910 --> 29:26.099
the redaction software
is working correctly.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.349
I mean, could you
imagine if there was some

29:28.350 --> 29:31.919
widespread malfunction that
was left unchecked for days?

29:31.920 --> 29:32.983
It'd be pandemonium.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.633
You have a son?

29:35.634 --> 29:37.519
I don't want to talk about that.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.573
Neither did I.

29:40.723 --> 29:41.674
Do you have kids?

29:41.675 --> 29:43.579
None that I know of.

29:43.580 --> 29:46.139
So, what do you do?

29:46.140 --> 29:47.379
Submarine captain.

29:47.380 --> 29:48.380
Ah.

29:49.210 --> 29:52.379
For ocean exploration or?

29:52.380 --> 29:54.199
Private parties mostly.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.239
What do you do?

29:55.240 --> 29:56.073
I am a submarine...

29:56.074 --> 29:58.819
I mean, I know you played
college football at Michigan.

29:58.820 --> 30:00.529
And you were good, too, what happened?

30:00.530 --> 30:02.799
Yeah, well, you know, not
everybody wants to go pro.

30:02.800 --> 30:06.049
I have bigger career aspirations.

30:06.050 --> 30:08.629
Of course not, who would want all that?

30:08.630 --> 30:12.159
Wealth, hot chicks, sports cars.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.729
You know, I would have
a lot more respect for you

30:14.730 --> 30:17.273
if you included athletic achievement.

30:18.410 --> 30:19.899
I'd have a lot more respect for you

30:19.900 --> 30:22.003
if you were a pro football player.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.150
Go dig a hole.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.423
Go waste your potential.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.089
Do you have any single
friends named Raul?

30:30.090 --> 30:32.709
Um, why Raul?

30:32.710 --> 30:35.269
Because I have a tattoo on my ass

30:35.270 --> 30:37.939
of a past relationship, it says Paul.

30:37.940 --> 30:40.663
Changing the P to an R would be simple.

30:41.710 --> 30:43.259
Um,

30:43.260 --> 30:46.289
why don't you just date
another guy named Paul?

30:46.290 --> 30:48.719
Well, I would imagine the
only thing worse than getting

30:48.720 --> 30:50.339
a girl naked for the first time

30:50.340 --> 30:52.309
and seeing another man's name is...

30:52.310 --> 30:54.740
Finding your own, nope.

30:54.741 --> 30:56.516
I got it.

30:59.150 --> 31:02.979
You know, this sorta
feels like a first date.

31:07.020 --> 31:08.520
I just got out of something.

31:09.830 --> 31:11.219
You wanna get into something?

31:11.220 --> 31:13.089
We're not gonna get anywhere
if you're gonna be evasive.

31:13.090 --> 31:15.060
We're here to be honest with each other.

31:15.061 --> 31:16.209
Yeah?

31:16.210 --> 31:17.210
Okay.

31:18.060 --> 31:20.923
You know what, you look so familiar.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.469
Say, how much would one of those

31:24.470 --> 31:26.143
deep-sea shindigs cost anyway?

31:28.640 --> 31:29.640
Okay.

31:30.670 --> 31:31.910
You have a son?

31:32.965 --> 31:34.962
I don't wanna talk about that.

31:34.963 --> 31:37.177
Son of a mother.

31:37.178 --> 31:38.562
Sometimes I
have to actually pick

31:38.563 --> 31:39.849
it up and shake it.

31:39.850 --> 31:41.239
That's never a good thing
to do with a computer, but...

31:41.240 --> 31:42.746
Thank you.

31:42.747 --> 31:44.157
You know, you
got to do what you got to do.

31:44.158 --> 31:45.629
How do you afford a house in the city?

31:45.630 --> 31:47.209
Did you rob a bank?

31:47.210 --> 31:49.319
This might be easier
if we meet in a bar.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.799
I don't drink.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.289
Don't like the taste?

31:52.290 --> 31:53.513
I lose control.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.800
Can I grab you a beer?

31:56.878 --> 32:00.419
You know, you look familiar,
I can't put my finger on it.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.873
It's probably because
you're vaguely ethnic.

32:05.430 --> 32:06.880
Just knowing

32:08.060 --> 32:09.703
the data has been served.

32:13.090 --> 32:17.343
Did, um, did you have
any questions for me or?

32:21.560 --> 32:23.413
Why do you look so familiar?

32:26.170 --> 32:27.699
We've searched INTERPOL.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.619
Birth records in every state and country,

32:29.620 --> 32:32.839
we've consulted all of our
contacts in Homeland Security

32:32.840 --> 32:35.119
and every international
syndicate we could think of.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.049
No one has heard of her.

32:37.050 --> 32:40.239
Now I'm sure Senise Deluca

32:40.240 --> 32:43.179
is some sort of fake name, of course.

32:43.180 --> 32:45.009
But even an alias has a history.

32:45.010 --> 32:45.993
It's as if she just dropped in out of...

32:45.994 --> 32:49.989
Birth name is Theresa Senise Delucia.

32:49.990 --> 32:50.823
What is this?

32:50.824 --> 32:52.609
Is this some sort of top-secret government

32:52.610 --> 32:54.219
database that I've never heard of?

32:54.220 --> 32:57.019
No, there's an actual
website that lists every movie

32:57.020 --> 33:00.139
and every TV show and everybody
that's ever worked on them.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.203
Senise Deluca's a stage name.

33:03.670 --> 33:05.193
Actress.

33:10.050 --> 33:11.829
Okay, Franny, now you.

33:11.830 --> 33:13.533
Look Ed in the eye and say it.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.859
Hello.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.296
Sup?

33:20.360 --> 33:23.313
Mike, can we just be done
with the fucking hello game?

33:25.221 --> 33:27.259
Would you like to inform
the group of your reasons

33:27.260 --> 33:29.159
for your dislike of the
hello game, Lincoln?

33:29.160 --> 33:31.299
Your assumption that we
don't know how to greet people

33:31.300 --> 33:32.929
is insulting, we know how to greet people,

33:32.930 --> 33:34.909
we just choose not to.

33:34.910 --> 33:39.149
The purpose of the hello
game is to remind those of you

33:39.150 --> 33:42.029
who aren't in the habit of greeting people

33:42.030 --> 33:43.589
that there is a pleasure in it

33:43.590 --> 33:45.949
once you get past your hesitance to do it.

33:45.950 --> 33:48.559
Yeah, it really didn't
do anything for me.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.450
I loved it.

33:49.451 --> 33:51.759
Shut up, Tanner, you
didn't even say hi to anyone.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.179
Ed, we never tell people
to shut up in this group.

33:54.180 --> 33:55.409
This is to be a safe place

33:55.410 --> 33:57.069
where people can express themselves.

33:57.070 --> 33:58.929
Ed was just expressing that he wants

33:58.930 --> 34:00.376
Tanner to shut the fuck up.

34:00.377 --> 34:01.909
And you just silenced him.

34:01.910 --> 34:02.743
Shut up.

34:02.744 --> 34:04.679
Senise, we never tell people to shut up.

34:04.680 --> 34:05.570
It's hopeless.

34:05.571 --> 34:07.379
No offense, but I am, mm,

34:07.380 --> 34:09.409
10 times the group therapist you are.

34:09.409 --> 34:13.139
And I fail too, so don't feel bad.

34:13.139 --> 34:14.748
What is your problem?

34:14.750 --> 34:18.149
We had a deal, and you're
not holding up your end.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.359
We did what you asked.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.149
No, you were supposed
to get to know each other.

34:22.150 --> 34:23.130
We did.

34:23.130 --> 34:24.030
How nice?

34:24.031 --> 34:26.059
Oh, is that so?

34:26.060 --> 34:27.283
Okay, um,

34:28.949 --> 34:30.913
Franny, hey girl.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.429
What's old Lincoln do for a living?

34:34.429 --> 34:35.429
Salesman.

34:36.719 --> 34:38.119
Of?

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
Dynamite.

34:40.300 --> 34:41.973
Mm, mm-hmm.

34:42.989 --> 34:44.822
Dynamite salesman.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.299
Uh, Ed?

34:48.300 --> 34:50.463
Does Franny have pets
and if so, what kind?

34:52.750 --> 34:53.822
Librarian.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.353
What?

34:56.353 --> 34:58.669
You shoulda asked me
something I know the answer to.

34:58.670 --> 34:59.799
Does everyone know what I do?

34:59.800 --> 35:00.726
I work in the IT...

35:00.726 --> 35:01.559
We know!

35:01.560 --> 35:03.829
This is pathetic.

35:03.830 --> 35:06.589
What did you all do, just sit
there staring at each other?

35:06.590 --> 35:08.709
Prolonged eye contact,
are you kidding me?

35:08.710 --> 35:11.219
None of you has an excuse.

35:11.220 --> 35:12.220
None of you.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.763
Jeremy, what did you
learn about everyone?

35:17.260 --> 35:18.260
Ugh, de bugh.

35:19.040 --> 35:23.439
He wasn't invited, so technically,

35:23.440 --> 35:25.343
he does have an excuse.

35:26.510 --> 35:30.359
Jeremy, you're excused and sorry.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.010
But the rest of you, pfffft.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.309
Are you gonna admit to us
why you look so familiar?

35:36.310 --> 35:39.299
That was not the point.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.699
Senise?

35:40.700 --> 35:43.639
Is there something you'd
like to share with the group?

35:43.640 --> 35:45.090
I sure would like to hear it.

35:48.210 --> 35:49.210
Fine.

35:50.260 --> 35:53.870
The reason you might
recognize me is because

35:55.240 --> 35:56.929
I was on a TV show when I was young.

35:56.930 --> 35:58.389
You probably don't remember.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.049
It Takes Ten to Tango.

36:00.050 --> 36:02.249
I just watched the marathon.

36:02.250 --> 36:05.079
You've really grown up
nicely since the show ended.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.089
The baby fat look was good,
too, don't get me wrong.

36:08.090 --> 36:11.059
You, you already knew?

36:11.060 --> 36:15.059
Have you heard of this thing
called the search engine?

36:15.060 --> 36:17.269
It's how we know about you.

36:17.270 --> 36:20.319
It's how we know about
Lincoln's illustrious

36:20.320 --> 36:22.599
non-pro football career.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.419
Oh, and Ed's white-collar crime.

36:26.420 --> 36:27.849
If I could speak for a moment.

36:27.850 --> 36:31.359
This is how we get to know
each other in this century.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.229
We don't need to talk to each other.

36:33.230 --> 36:36.009
I didn't need to search engine you.

36:36.010 --> 36:37.369
I loved that show.

36:37.370 --> 36:39.663
This is the first
I'm hearing of any of this.

36:40.540 --> 36:42.319
If you wanna know what I think,

36:42.320 --> 36:45.743
I find this very, very sad.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.000
And that's something you can't
learn on a search engine.

36:51.300 --> 36:54.159
Well maybe you should post it as a meme.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.559
We all follow you now.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.779
It could be a picture of
a million whining babies

36:59.780 --> 37:03.343
in a football stadium that
Lincoln wished he'd played in.

37:29.044 --> 37:30.223
Please return your headband

37:30.224 --> 37:31.160
to your head.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.781
You don't wanna do that.

37:32.782 --> 37:33.950
Please return your headband

37:33.951 --> 37:35.034
to your head.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.742
Please return your headband to your head.

37:39.743 --> 37:41.070
I strongly suggest you pick that up

37:41.071 --> 37:42.495
and put it back on your head.

37:42.496 --> 37:44.308
Please return your headband

37:44.309 --> 37:45.599
to your head, please return your headband

37:45.600 --> 37:48.388
to your head, please return
your headband to your head.

37:48.389 --> 37:49.839
Please return your headband to your head.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.823
God, I'm so sick of this headband.

37:52.248 --> 37:53.881
Be sure
to have a friendly day.

37:54.590 --> 37:57.829
I'm so sick of trying to
match it to my clothes.

37:57.830 --> 38:01.453
You know, you do not
crown this, with this.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.109
And I hate how long it takes to dry

38:04.110 --> 38:05.329
when I get out of the shower.

38:05.330 --> 38:07.649
And I have constant recurring nightmares

38:07.650 --> 38:11.689
that a very weak snake is
trying to crush my head.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.599
Best keep that to yourself.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.239
They're listening to every word you say,

38:15.240 --> 38:17.869
looking for a reason to erase you.

38:17.870 --> 38:19.299
Great.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.300
Let them.

38:24.610 --> 38:27.509
Before I was put on this stupid list,

38:27.510 --> 38:30.849
I actually thought that this
was a good idea, you know.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.759
Find the wackos and help
them before they flip out.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.760
But now I'm,

38:36.200 --> 38:38.820
I'm as disgruntled and agitated as you...

38:38.821 --> 38:42.653
You got to keep yourself
together, they're watching you.

38:43.616 --> 38:46.149
They're watching every move you make.

38:46.150 --> 38:49.217
You got to keep your cool,
because there is a way out.

38:50.330 --> 38:51.469
There is?

38:51.470 --> 38:55.293
You just got to keep playing
the game, and trust nobody.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.560
You hear me?

38:58.300 --> 39:00.205
Trust nobody.

39:00.206 --> 39:01.039
Okay.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.039
Trust nobody.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.673
Rust obody.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.954
Also.

39:06.955 --> 39:07.788
God dammit.

39:07.789 --> 39:09.999
The cockroaches have microchips.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.676
It's amazing what they can do these days.

39:12.677 --> 39:13.677
These days.

39:14.603 --> 39:15.679
'Ese 'ays.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.850
You got a little something right.

39:24.990 --> 39:25.990
Other side.

39:35.605 --> 39:37.344
Swung on,
lined toward right fielder,

39:37.345 --> 39:41.762
but there's the right fielder
and he makes the catch.

39:44.273 --> 39:46.119
That can't be a coincidence, can it?

39:46.120 --> 39:48.299
Book chick and nasal voice dude

39:48.300 --> 39:51.023
both showing up early like
that at the same time?

39:52.490 --> 39:53.619
Not likely.

39:53.620 --> 39:56.289
We got to come up with
better code names, man.

39:56.290 --> 39:58.599
Those aren't code names, I just

39:58.600 --> 40:00.150
never learned their real names.

40:02.025 --> 40:05.253
Lines out to right field,

40:05.254 --> 40:06.754
that'll bring up...

40:08.597 --> 40:10.539
0-for-4 last night, 0-for-2 this evening.

40:10.540 --> 40:14.089
The only time I'm early is

40:14.090 --> 40:16.599
when I make a mistake with the time.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.300
If you're not 30 minutes
early, you're an hour late.

40:22.510 --> 40:25.039
You're actually watching
baseball on your phone?

40:25.040 --> 40:26.419
You are too.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.789
But you don't like sports.

40:28.790 --> 40:29.876
I never said that.

40:29.877 --> 40:31.409
You said they're stupid.

40:31.410 --> 40:32.410
They are.

40:33.150 --> 40:34.769
My life doesn't change one bit

40:34.770 --> 40:36.929
regardless of the outcome of this game.

40:36.930 --> 40:39.539
And yet I'm invested in it as if it will.

40:39.540 --> 40:40.540
That's stupid.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.773
Do you wanna sit or something?

40:49.217 --> 40:50.563
I'm sitting over there.

40:51.430 --> 40:52.633
Watching Brooklyn?

40:54.320 --> 40:56.119
They left Brooklyn in 194...

40:56.120 --> 40:59.193
A History of the
Integration of Baseball.

41:02.780 --> 41:03.880
That was a good one.

41:07.071 --> 41:08.119
Is it a good book?

41:08.120 --> 41:09.719
Well it's not the one you read,

41:09.720 --> 41:12.099
so I can't participate in
a book discussion with you.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.250
You know what, I'll
just leave you alone.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.283
This is Ethan Frome.

41:24.965 --> 41:26.849
Is it any good?

41:26.850 --> 41:29.309
Well, I've read it
every year since I was 15,

41:29.310 --> 41:31.069
so yeah, I'd say so.

41:31.070 --> 41:32.070
What's it about?

41:32.830 --> 41:37.830
A sad, lonely guy that
starts to find hope,

41:38.060 --> 41:39.549
and then loses it.

41:39.550 --> 41:41.529
Sheesh, pass.

41:41.530 --> 41:42.380
That's what I thought.

41:42.381 --> 41:45.513
You don't have much respect
for my intellect, do you?

41:46.350 --> 41:48.309
Why am I even sitting here?

41:48.310 --> 41:50.989
Anaheim and Texas, Jesus, it's like

41:50.990 --> 41:54.809
the two guys who nailed my
girlfriend fighting each other,

41:54.810 --> 41:56.863
except there's no way both can lose.

42:09.090 --> 42:12.279
I would rather listen
to someone chew a banana

42:12.280 --> 42:15.309
in my ear all day

42:15.310 --> 42:18.593
than have to listen to
that mating ritual again.

42:24.970 --> 42:26.770
Everything all right, sir?

42:28.569 --> 42:30.399
What makes people like each other?

42:30.400 --> 42:31.400
Sir?

42:33.060 --> 42:34.310
What makes people bond?

42:35.590 --> 42:36.590
Become friends?

42:39.100 --> 42:40.733
It just happens, sir.

42:42.540 --> 42:43.540
I suppose.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.929
Or it doesn't.

42:46.930 --> 42:49.373
Yeah, sometimes it doesn't, sir.

42:51.630 --> 42:52.630
You're dismissed.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.650
You're sure about them?

42:58.651 --> 42:59.484
Hm-mm.

42:59.485 --> 43:01.369
Franny doesn't fit the profile.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.789
And Tanner has no game with the ladies,

43:02.790 --> 43:04.109
so it's for sure.

43:04.110 --> 43:06.279
What does that have to do with anything?

43:06.280 --> 43:07.963
Just call it woman's intuition.

43:08.970 --> 43:10.909
I think we can count Dabney out.

43:10.910 --> 43:11.743
I agree.

43:11.744 --> 43:13.899
Mm-hmm, we're narrowing it down.

43:13.900 --> 43:15.399
Yeah, but we have to be certain.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.049
Delgado's become a brick wall.

43:17.050 --> 43:18.166
Is he onto you?

43:18.167 --> 43:20.239
No, it's not me.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.009
He's a weird dude.

43:22.010 --> 43:24.529
He spends all of his time at the office.

43:24.530 --> 43:27.279
I mean, literally, all of his time.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.909
He doesn't talk to friends.

43:28.910 --> 43:30.210
He doesn't talk to family.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.242
He's obsessed.

43:46.493 --> 43:47.493
What is

43:48.798 --> 43:49.798
happening?

43:59.107 --> 44:01.236
I find that loners will
often like to reach out

44:01.237 --> 44:03.169
and make friends but they lack the courage

44:03.170 --> 44:05.029
and skills to even try.

44:05.030 --> 44:07.969
That's why I made up this
little role-playing improve game,

44:07.970 --> 44:11.159
so you can all fail big
time in a safe place.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.999
Jeremy, let's have you come up.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.459
You crotch-smelling,
bitch-face ass bucket.

44:16.460 --> 44:18.649
You know what's going on here?

44:18.650 --> 44:21.639
These special glasses
were keeping the radiation

44:21.640 --> 44:23.489
from getting into my eye brain.

44:23.490 --> 44:26.009
Now this fool wants me to start talking.

44:26.010 --> 44:27.809
That's how the microbes get in.

44:27.810 --> 44:29.037
The microbes.

44:37.046 --> 44:38.796
Timeout for Jeremy.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.053
Franny, let's have you come up.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.400
Go up.

44:49.817 --> 44:50.817
And Tanner.

44:54.830 --> 44:55.830
Here's the scene.

44:57.330 --> 44:58.743
You're waiting for a train.

45:00.560 --> 45:01.560
And go.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.177
How?

45:04.178 --> 45:05.795
Oh, Just say whatever's on your mind.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.490
I don't like the way the
birds are looking at me today.

45:12.910 --> 45:13.939
Okay.

45:13.940 --> 45:14.940
Tanner.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.409
Maybe the birds hate you.

45:17.410 --> 45:18.759
Keep it positive.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.395
The birds definitely hate you.

45:20.396 --> 45:23.469
Why do you have to be such a
fucking asshole every second?

45:23.470 --> 45:25.089
No, you wouldn't know that
because you've never met.

45:25.090 --> 45:27.659
I was trying to be nice to you.

45:27.660 --> 45:29.410
No, again, you would not
because you've never met.

45:29.411 --> 45:30.517
When?

45:30.518 --> 45:33.089
The other morning when
we were both here early.

45:33.090 --> 45:34.103
No that wouldn't have happened.

45:34.104 --> 45:35.209
That was you being nice?

45:35.210 --> 45:36.460
Maybe if you weren't so

45:37.470 --> 45:39.979
obsessed with assuming that I was an idiot

45:39.980 --> 45:40.820
you would have noticed.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.159
Assuming doesn't take any energy.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.579
You just make the assumption.

45:43.580 --> 45:44.759
There you go again.

45:44.760 --> 45:45.843
Ed, tag in.

45:55.290 --> 45:58.480
I find that in real life
sometimes it's easier

46:00.005 --> 46:02.599
to meet people when we
pretend to be someone

46:02.600 --> 46:05.399
completely different
than who we actually are.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.639
Really?

46:06.640 --> 46:09.020
I always thought the best policy was to

46:09.880 --> 46:11.119
be yourself.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.129
Yes, that's true, if you were someone

46:13.130 --> 46:15.153
that people would actually
want to get to know.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.659
Franny, approach Ed not as Franny

46:21.660 --> 46:25.719
but as Miss Pennyfeather Wentwhistle.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.809
You're a high-society gentlewoman

46:27.810 --> 46:31.399
on your way to town to
peruse the jewelry district

46:31.400 --> 46:35.073
and the latest fashion
in broaches and hat pins.

46:37.425 --> 46:39.054
Hi, I'm Penny.

46:39.055 --> 46:39.888
Feather.

46:39.888 --> 46:40.721
Feather Whistle.

46:40.721 --> 46:41.554
Pennyfeather Wentwhistle.

46:41.554 --> 46:42.420
Pennyfeather Wentwhistle,
I'm going to town

46:42.421 --> 46:43.509
to look for hats.

46:43.510 --> 46:44.543
Pins, hat pins.

46:45.770 --> 46:46.770
And you are?

46:49.230 --> 46:50.063
Ed.

46:50.064 --> 46:51.359
Jesus.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.769
Uh, no.

46:52.770 --> 46:53.770
You're

46:54.570 --> 46:57.113
Rex Cannon, a Southern oilman.

47:01.020 --> 47:02.083
I'm Rex Cannon,

47:03.090 --> 47:05.609
an oil baron.

47:05.610 --> 47:06.443
Yeah, I like that.

47:06.444 --> 47:08.539
But use a Southern accent and be manly.

47:08.540 --> 47:09.540
Mike.

47:10.350 --> 47:13.699
These aren't exactly
masters of improve acting.

47:13.700 --> 47:15.979
Sinese, perhaps you'd like
to show us how to do it,

47:15.980 --> 47:17.380
since you're such an expert.

47:18.680 --> 47:19.739
Lincoln, tag in.

47:19.740 --> 47:21.275
Mike, I didn't even say anything.

47:21.276 --> 47:22.109
Tag in.

47:22.110 --> 47:23.279
Tag in!

47:23.280 --> 47:25.030
Mike, I wasn't even the one who...

47:32.270 --> 47:34.453
Rex, engage the Southern socialite.

47:36.050 --> 47:38.129
Well, howdy there, little Missy.

47:38.130 --> 47:40.219
How are you this fine day?

47:42.640 --> 47:43.759
I'm good.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.593
Am I good, Mike?

47:44.594 --> 47:46.359
Good? Not good at all.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.539
What this scene needs is conflict.

47:48.540 --> 47:50.219
I thought this was
an exercise to teach us

47:50.220 --> 47:52.029
how to meet people?

47:52.030 --> 47:55.269
Yes, but there's no
reason it has to be boring.

47:55.270 --> 47:56.729
Pennyfeather, this man
has done you a great wrong,

47:56.730 --> 47:57.570
but, Rex, you don't know that.

47:57.571 --> 47:59.029
You think he's just a
complete stranger, and go.

47:59.030 --> 48:00.384
How has he wronged me?

48:00.385 --> 48:02.385
I don't know, it's improve, make it up.

48:06.270 --> 48:07.769
Hey, Rex.

48:07.770 --> 48:10.399
Aren't you the guy that
swindled my entire family

48:10.400 --> 48:12.799
out of their life savings
with a pyramid scheme

48:12.800 --> 48:15.309
and then got outta major
jail time by giving up

48:15.310 --> 48:16.910
all the cronies you did it with?

48:18.880 --> 48:20.073
Not bad, it'll do.

48:23.196 --> 48:24.960
Down, boys.

48:29.910 --> 48:31.060
Two more people tag in.

48:32.620 --> 48:33.828
Anyone?

48:34.850 --> 48:36.075
Fine.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.160
Dabney.

48:48.430 --> 48:51.383
Mr. Cannon, you killed
my father in a duel.

48:52.370 --> 48:53.499
No I didn't.

48:53.500 --> 48:55.900
There's no no in improve,
it's always yes, and.

48:56.999 --> 48:58.653
Yes, I did kill him.

48:59.313 --> 49:00.313
And...

49:01.041 --> 49:03.503
I did things to his body?

49:04.900 --> 49:08.623
Terrible things, horrible,
unspeakable things.

49:09.740 --> 49:10.933
Sexual things?

49:12.770 --> 49:14.199
No you didn't.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.033
You just said...

49:15.034 --> 49:16.521
Sit down.

49:28.340 --> 49:30.304
I knew Enoch Wentwhitsle as a young man.

49:30.305 --> 49:34.658
He was, I say, I say, he
was a rogue and a charlatan.

49:35.450 --> 49:38.169
I vehemently disagree with
the spurious assessment

49:38.170 --> 49:39.873
of my dear deceased daddy.

49:41.991 --> 49:44.229
I say, I say, I say I forgive you, ma'am,

49:44.230 --> 49:47.582
for the love and devotion to
the man you call your father,

49:47.583 --> 49:49.099
though it is based on a veiled

49:49.100 --> 49:51.643
and distorted version of the truth.

49:51.644 --> 49:52.839
Shut up.

49:52.840 --> 49:55.149
For the love of God,

49:55.150 --> 49:56.669
shut up.

49:56.670 --> 49:57.879
You're insane.

49:57.880 --> 50:01.039
Nothing you are doing is
helping any of these people,

50:01.040 --> 50:03.153
do you not see that?

50:04.150 --> 50:07.659
Is it really so hard for any of you

50:07.660 --> 50:11.489
to get past your
all-consuming self-absorption

50:11.490 --> 50:15.743
and just be a non-asshole for one second?

50:16.780 --> 50:19.479
I wouldn't wanna be a single one of you.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.369
You should be

50:21.370 --> 50:22.370
wishing,

50:23.160 --> 50:26.329
praying, on your knees begging,

50:26.330 --> 50:29.229
for anyone to talk to
you just to relieve you

50:29.230 --> 50:32.949
for one moment of the cruel
existential prison sentence

50:32.950 --> 50:37.603
you face every day by
just being who you are.

50:38.550 --> 50:40.179
Fuck you!

50:40.180 --> 50:41.669
Fuck you all,

50:41.670 --> 50:43.613
in your loner asses!

50:47.160 --> 50:48.493
What a psycho.

50:49.340 --> 50:50.340
Oh, that's time.

50:51.270 --> 50:54.309
This is your grand plan, Delgado?

50:54.310 --> 50:56.049
What you just witnessed

50:56.050 --> 50:58.759
was the final step before we
introduce our secret weapon.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.489
Please tell me it's
something that explodes

51:00.490 --> 51:01.659
or shoots lasers.

51:01.660 --> 51:04.769
You were on
thin ice before, Delgado.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.189
Hope you got your water wings.

51:06.190 --> 51:08.326
The clock is ticking.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.389
Short-sighted fools.

51:18.390 --> 51:19.390
Yes, sir.

51:22.350 --> 51:23.489
Going somewhere, bro?

51:23.490 --> 51:26.489
Yeah, I'm gonna go home,
is that okay with you, cuz?

51:26.490 --> 51:29.429
Sure you don't got more
to say to me first, my man?

51:29.430 --> 51:32.269
No, no, no, I'm good, home slice.

51:32.270 --> 51:33.479
Positive, bucco, because you were doing

51:33.480 --> 51:35.159
a lotta talking in there, hombre.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.929
Okay, look, Ed, I'm
running out of synonyms

51:36.930 --> 51:39.399
that guys call each other, so can we just?

51:39.400 --> 51:41.889
I knew you'd blink first, chico.

51:41.890 --> 51:43.190
You got a problem with me?

51:45.263 --> 51:47.019
Hey, I'm talking to you.

51:47.020 --> 51:48.193
Why do you care?

51:49.530 --> 51:51.579
You got to stop caring what people think

51:51.580 --> 51:54.529
about you, man, it'll
drive you nuts, all right.

51:54.530 --> 51:58.069
If you are okay with what you did, great.

51:58.070 --> 51:59.070
I'm not.

52:02.270 --> 52:06.379
Did your family really
lose money from what I did?

52:06.380 --> 52:07.380
No, man.

52:09.295 --> 52:10.403
No, no.

52:11.820 --> 52:13.859
I just made that up as part of the improve.

52:13.860 --> 52:15.699
I just was deep in the role.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.287
Look, I'm sorry I said that.

52:17.288 --> 52:19.985
Aw, two loners having a conversation.

52:20.640 --> 52:22.799
Hell must have frozen over.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.079
You want me to scare
the shit out of them?

52:24.080 --> 52:26.669
Oh, affirmative, kemo sabe.

52:26.670 --> 52:28.100
Good one, let's go.

52:29.133 --> 52:30.999
Hey, come here, come here.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.159
You want me to strip that
leather off your body?

52:35.354 --> 52:38.187
<i>♪ I'm alone again ♪</i>

52:55.744 --> 52:57.327
Come in.

53:00.870 --> 53:02.479
You can't just

53:02.480 --> 53:04.730
open the door like that,
I coulda been a fed.

53:06.470 --> 53:07.470
I was hoping.

53:11.626 --> 53:13.219
What do you got there, soup?

53:13.220 --> 53:14.220
Whiskey.

53:15.046 --> 53:16.263
Oh, in a bowl.

53:18.102 --> 53:20.749
I didn't feel like washing my glasses,

53:20.750 --> 53:23.633
and I have too much pride to
drink straight from the bottle.

53:29.620 --> 53:30.893
Hey-o, guys.

53:32.820 --> 53:33.820
Come on in.

53:35.440 --> 53:36.970
Pour yourself a bowl of Jack.

53:39.237 --> 53:40.824
Yeesh.

53:53.789 --> 53:56.122
Should I pull the trigger?

54:06.770 --> 54:09.693
None of my friends wanna
be seen with headband girl.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.719
Bitches.

54:12.720 --> 54:14.209
Bitches.
Bitches.

54:14.210 --> 54:15.210
Hey.

54:18.410 --> 54:20.110
How'd you get on the watch list?

54:21.030 --> 54:22.593
Married a big producer.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.209
Shouldn't have signed that prenup.

54:25.210 --> 54:28.693
All I got to keep were the
clothes, which are fabulous.

54:29.590 --> 54:30.590
I just

54:31.830 --> 54:34.773
don't feel like reaching out
to people like I used to.

54:36.700 --> 54:38.369
Can I tell you guys a secret?

54:38.370 --> 54:39.370
Uh-huh.

54:40.300 --> 54:42.459
Last month, I didn't go to my

54:42.460 --> 54:44.959
best friend's birthday party.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.259
Bingo, there you go.

54:47.260 --> 54:48.093
What?

54:48.093 --> 54:49.080
Your red flag.

54:49.080 --> 54:49.950
Hm-hmm.

54:49.951 --> 54:52.469
Were you invited to this party online?

54:52.470 --> 54:56.289
Yeah, but I didn't RSVP either way.

54:56.290 --> 54:58.299
I mean, no one does, right?

54:58.300 --> 54:59.579
It doesn't matter, though.

54:59.580 --> 55:01.139
You didn't show up at your best friend's

55:01.140 --> 55:04.059
publicly posted birthday
party, which means that

55:04.060 --> 55:05.053
your cellphone wasn't there, either.

55:05.054 --> 55:07.989
And that's the cellphone
that happens to track

55:07.990 --> 55:10.879
every single location of your
body on this planet Earth.

55:10.880 --> 55:12.999
Welcome to the future.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.529
Could be worse.

55:14.530 --> 55:16.203
Pretty sure my son turned me in.

55:17.180 --> 55:18.120
Ouch.

55:18.121 --> 55:19.839
Really?

55:19.840 --> 55:22.623
I was on house arrest
for a couple years.

55:23.540 --> 55:25.019
My wife left somewhere in there,

55:25.020 --> 55:26.959
and Kiefer decided to go with her.

55:26.960 --> 55:28.363
Can't say that I blame him.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.300
Neither do I.

55:30.983 --> 55:32.033
If you named him Kiefer.

55:39.010 --> 55:40.963
After the house arrest ended,

55:42.410 --> 55:44.269
I could see the alarm on his face

55:44.270 --> 55:45.513
at the state of my life.

55:47.050 --> 55:48.789
Guess he figured his old
man needed a headband

55:48.790 --> 55:50.590
to go along with the ankle bracelet.

55:52.080 --> 55:56.154
Maybe what he did was misguided, but

55:56.155 --> 55:58.959
then again, no kid his age should have

55:58.960 --> 56:00.142
to look out for his father.

56:00.600 --> 56:02.283
Are you mad at him?

56:02.700 --> 56:03.750
I'm not mad at him.

56:05.460 --> 56:06.737
Does he know that?

56:09.023 --> 56:10.573
I mean, he has to.

56:11.750 --> 56:12.852
Right?

56:19.210 --> 56:20.773
I was in a dark place.

56:22.819 --> 56:23.819
I still am, but

56:26.131 --> 56:27.163
not like I was.

56:34.490 --> 56:37.390
Well I thought they were
playing a practical joke on me.

56:39.540 --> 56:42.099
I thought, you know, one
of my old college buddies

56:42.100 --> 56:44.899
had sent me a fake court summons, right?

56:44.900 --> 56:46.839
So I start calling all those fuckers

56:46.840 --> 56:50.693
and saying, hey, who sent
me the fake court summons?

56:51.920 --> 56:54.839
And then I realized that
I hadn't talked to them

56:54.840 --> 56:57.169
in like years, and the thing is,

56:57.170 --> 56:59.170
they're all still talking to each other.

57:00.350 --> 57:02.793
So they start all asking
me the question, you know?

57:03.890 --> 57:05.633
What are you up to these days, man?

57:06.800 --> 57:09.839
I hate that question.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.329
That's like the second question
that anybody ever asks you

57:12.330 --> 57:13.480
after what's your name?

57:14.380 --> 57:15.459
What are you up to these days?

57:15.460 --> 57:16.623
Hi, I'm Lincoln, I,

57:18.610 --> 57:19.953
I used to do something.

57:21.250 --> 57:22.250
I used to

57:23.400 --> 57:25.483
love something.

57:27.830 --> 57:30.687
And now, I work in the mall.

57:34.490 --> 57:36.879
And then I wear this every day.

57:36.880 --> 57:38.763
I don't have a story.

57:39.860 --> 57:42.063
I enjoy watering my plants,

57:42.920 --> 57:44.243
and I have a cat,

57:45.460 --> 57:47.669
and I actually shush people at the library

57:47.670 --> 57:49.070
when they're being too loud.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.549
Maybe it's the result
of being the only person

57:52.550 --> 57:55.109
from Texarkana that likes goth rock.

57:55.110 --> 57:58.289
There's no way they're
gonna pass me by, either.

57:58.290 --> 58:01.399
I have zero interest in social etiquette.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.653
I say exactly what I'm
thinking at all times.

58:06.010 --> 58:09.723
I would think that would bring
me respect and popularity.

58:10.630 --> 58:13.653
Instead, I'm sitting here
with you fucking losers.

58:14.590 --> 58:16.699
From the beginning, I
vowed that I would never let

58:16.700 --> 58:18.709
anything the government
had to say about me

58:18.710 --> 58:20.629
make me change who I am.

58:20.630 --> 58:21.759
Me too.

58:21.760 --> 58:22.956
Fuck that noise.

58:22.957 --> 58:23.997
Assholes.

58:23.998 --> 58:24.998
Yeah.

58:26.526 --> 58:27.723
But maybe they're right.

58:28.760 --> 58:29.833
Just a little bit,

58:30.700 --> 58:31.743
by mistake.

58:33.100 --> 58:34.889
I've heard that even really social people

58:34.890 --> 58:37.099
need alone time now and then.

58:37.100 --> 58:38.593
Doesn't it go both ways?

58:40.000 --> 58:42.529
It'd be nice to be able to
take a break from who I am

58:42.530 --> 58:45.939
once in a while without
feeling like I'm selling out.

58:45.940 --> 58:49.313
Good God, let's stop
being so hard on ourselves.

58:50.530 --> 58:52.950
Let's take a little bit of
solace in the fact that we

58:58.544 --> 58:59.377
have had these little meetings
together for a long time

58:59.377 --> 59:00.210
without those douche bag
feds finding out about it.

59:00.211 --> 59:01.699
It's pretty good.

59:01.700 --> 59:02.859
Fuck the feds.

59:02.860 --> 59:03.860
Yeah.

59:04.872 --> 59:07.817
Fuck the feds.
Fuck the feds.

59:07.818 --> 59:09.988
Fuck the feds, fuck the feds,

59:09.989 --> 59:12.039
fuck the feds, fuck the feds.

59:12.040 --> 59:15.509
I will literally give you
everything in my savings account

59:15.510 --> 59:17.357
if we can go in and bust them right now,

59:17.358 --> 59:19.090
and I'm talking like $2,300.

59:19.091 --> 59:20.091
Shhhh.

59:21.921 --> 59:25.533
Dabney, do you have
anything you wanna say?

59:28.170 --> 59:29.319
Not really.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.629
Come on, Dabbers,
there's got to be something

59:31.630 --> 59:33.379
in that big brain you wanna share.

59:33.380 --> 59:37.121
Other than what you
do for a living, please.

59:37.122 --> 59:38.649
I think it's pretty clear that we are

59:38.650 --> 59:41.149
in a judgment-free zone here.

59:41.150 --> 59:42.229
Except for me.

59:42.230 --> 59:45.453
I'm judging you, I don't
have an off switch.

59:47.358 --> 59:49.443
Come on, come on.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.600
I definitely belong on the watch list.

59:54.530 --> 59:57.199
I'm single, I spend most of my time alone.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.229
I often feel misunderstood and frustrated

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.299
why the rest of society
never seems to appreciate me.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.063
Or even notice me.

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:12.393
One way that I differ from most loners is,

01:00:15.603 --> 01:00:17.453
I would actually like to have friends

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:19.820
and be around people.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560
They just,

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:24.423
just never really, uh,

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:27.850
seem to

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.433
like me very much.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.040
Hey, Dabney?

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:43.450
I like you.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.573
Yes.

01:01:10.574 --> 01:01:15.460
Sir, uh, something
is, something's happening.

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:20.679
Yes?

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.299
I don't know if it's
a good or a bad thing.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.300
What is it?

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.290
They're bonding.

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.701
It's a real

01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:33.968
lovefest in there right now.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.800
Sir?

01:01:40.699 --> 01:01:42.640
The final phase of the plan

01:01:43.888 --> 01:01:45.055
can now begin.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.740
Delgado out.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.929
What did he say?

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:53.780
He's happy.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.613
For real?

01:01:54.614 --> 01:01:55.929
Ha ha ha, dead cereal.

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:57.409
Jesus, that guy is hard to read.

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:58.360
What kinda plan is this?

01:01:58.361 --> 01:01:59.949
Who cares? Let's get outta here.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.036
But shouldn't we wait until...

01:02:01.037 --> 01:02:02.559
No, we deserve a night off.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.239
These people are making me suicidal.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.749
I want to drown myself in my own urine.

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:11.375
Come on, let's go home
and hug our families.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:14.083
You're sure.

01:02:14.084 --> 01:02:16.809
Positive, I've
never seen Delgado so happy.

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:17.810
I'm going in.

01:02:19.413 --> 01:02:21.903
And, Paige, good work.

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:24.659
I'm going to tell our boss everything

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.799
you've done for our cause.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.963
Thank you, sir.

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:37.184
Here I go, staggering my exit.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.499
Oh hey, can I borrow your phone?

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500
Yeah.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.638
Thank you.

01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:51.773
I'm gonna go look at the stars.

01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:57.533
Hey, it's your dad.

01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:59.380
You free tomorrow?

01:02:59.381 --> 01:03:00.993
I'd like to talk to you.

01:03:02.433 --> 01:03:03.433
See you then.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640
Hey.

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.951
I meant to tell you, I
started reading this...

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:55.199
We need to talk.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.849
Loud cheers at the president's

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:59.289
rally last night as he vowed to quote,

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.029
Punch the bejesus out
of anyone sticking up

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:04.449
for headbanders trying to strike fear

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:07.149
into the hearts of normal Americans.

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:10.019
The president said some
loners were great people

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:13.379
but they had to be saved
from their quote, weird life,

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.843
and that he was the only
one who could do that.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.293
It's been disabled.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.999
Do you have his phone?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.619
Your phone.

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.770
What the hell, man, that's new!

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:31.009
Now it's old.

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:32.779
What do you mean missing?

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:35.740
Off the radar, sir,
he's not at home, and

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:39.459
there's no signal from his cellphone.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:44.239
I apologize for the
impolite greeting here today,

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.949
but the hood was absolutely necessary,

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.409
and it's of utmost importance you not know

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:50.949
the sight of this meeting.

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:53.549
This white tarped popup room

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:55.693
could in fact be anywhere in the world.

01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:00.639
We're in the City of Industry,

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.329
right off the Pomona Freeway at the corner

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:04.569
of Newquist and Proctor.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.563
Taser Ted here, he had
the GPS on the whole way.

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:15.330
GPS?

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.040
Leave us.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.249
I'm in, what's her name again?

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.250
Clara.

01:05:23.258 --> 01:05:24.258
Last name?

01:05:25.483 --> 01:05:27.397
We never got that far.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.060
What's up with all
the Swedish furniture?

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.869
Let me get to the point, Mr. Chalk.

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:39.939
You're in danger.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.829
And we're here to help you.

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:43.299
Now listen to me carefully.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.259
My name is Mr. Tessman.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.899
I work for someone who
has a vested interest

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.659
in the failure of the War on Loneliness.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.959
Now what happens in the next
few days is going to have

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.659
a large impact on that war's future,

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.303
and you are going to play
a very large part in it.

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:05.749
Don't be so sure, I'm
actually surprisingly lazy.

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.473
You're already deeply involved.

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:10.569
And my people had nothing to do with it.

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:12.043
But like I said before,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.550
we're going to try to help you.

01:06:15.878 --> 01:06:17.709
Yeah, I'm going to
need to know who you're

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:19.653
working for, Mr. Tessman.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.523
Let's just say,

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.970
it is an individual

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:29.999
who has a deep philosophical
opposition to the government's

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.589
attack of a person's right to stand alone.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:37.699
Yeah, well, lots of people
are opposed to this program.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.123
What makes your boss so different?

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.113
Well for one thing, resources.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.180
Money?

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.823
And people.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.289
We've been able to
place some collaborators

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:54.609
at very high levels.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.409
The information which they've gathered

01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:57.903
will be your salvation.

01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:01.513
Assuming you agree to help us.

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:04.590
Is this her address?

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.180
Yeah, that's it.

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.399
Weird.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.400
What?

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.369
Usually they give a
pretty good description.

01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:15.823
But this is just three words.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.536
To make room.

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:26.439
I still need to know who this us is.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.857
Who am I agreeing to help?

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.379
If I were to say the word recluse,

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.159
what name would spring to mind?

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160
Brown.

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:35.950
Brown?

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.433
Brown recluse spider.

01:07:37.434 --> 01:07:39.449
Oh the spider, no, a person.

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:41.099
There is the,

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.339
the biggest loner of all time.

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.714
That guy who would stay
in his house all the time

01:07:44.715 --> 01:07:45.899
and had the tissue boxes for shoes,

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.810
but you can't possibly mean him.

01:07:46.811 --> 01:07:49.489
I do, I do, I am talking about

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:51.969
the most famous, the
most accomplished loner

01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:56.019
in world history, Howard Randolph Hughes.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.819
Who has been dead for many years.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.899
But his progeny live on in his name.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.250
No, Hughes didn't, he was progeny-less.

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:04.210
Incorrect.

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.869
He had a child very late in his life.

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:09.399
It was secreted away, but who was left

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.669
a very substantial portion of his legacy.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.879
That, Mr. Chalk, is who I work for,

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.801
and we need your help.

01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:24.613
So seriously, what's up with
all the Swedish furniture?

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.698
You let me know the minute you find him.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.099
If Lincoln Chalk isn't at
the next Lone-Anon meeting,

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.850
the whole goddam thing falls apart!

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:38.343
We'll find him.

01:08:38.343 --> 01:08:39.343
We'll find him.

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.970
Fucking idiot.

01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:43.578
Shit, did that?

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.412
Jesus.

01:08:44.413 --> 01:08:46.350
No, it's off, it was off, he hung up.

01:08:50.049 --> 01:08:51.689
Son of a bitch.

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:52.523
God!

01:08:52.524 --> 01:08:54.759
Mr. Chalk, the Swedish
furniture can remain unassembled.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.629
But this helps me think.

01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:59.356
Okay, can you,

01:08:59.357 --> 01:09:01.662
can you just explain
it to me again please?

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.853
This may be difficult for you to hear.

01:09:11.062 --> 01:09:12.383
I'm sorry to inform you,

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:17.799
but Miss Deluca is a government plant.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.479
That sucks.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.322
Who's Miss Deluca?

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:22.933
Senise, Mr. Chalk.

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:25.603
Holy shit.

01:09:25.604 --> 01:09:27.389
Are you telling me Senise has
been working for the feds?

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:28.223
From the beginning.

01:09:28.224 --> 01:09:30.779
No, no, no, no, that's not possible.

01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:32.559
What, it's not possible
that a desperate,

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.339
out-of-work actress would
use her skills to defend

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.490
her country against
people she's never met?

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.919
Okay, yeah, okay.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:45.959
No, she was sent to
infiltrate your poker game,

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.029
earn your trust and
then take you all down.

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:50.975
But mainly you.

01:09:50.977 --> 01:09:53.288
You were to be framed and exposed

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.259
as a violent threat and then vanquished.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.269
And that would provide
a huge public relations

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:00.769
victory for the program.

01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:01.770
Holy shit.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.150
Vanquished?

01:10:04.151 --> 01:10:05.289
Vanquished.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:08.469
Why, why, why me, why am I
the one that gets vanquished?

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:11.893
Because you are the perfect choice.

01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:15.239
You are a registered loner.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.019
You've been involved with
secret and illegal activities

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.529
with that little club of yours.

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.649
But most importantly, your
past athletic achievement

01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:25.263
provides automatic notoriety.

01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:31.899
What people love more
than an against-all-odds

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.919
success story is seeing a talented,

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.129
attractive individual fall to pieces.

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.823
Makes everybody feel
better about themselves.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.073
At the next meeting, a gun
will be planted in your bag.

01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:52.409
At the same time, more
evidence will be planted

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:54.579
pointing toward a grand plan on your part

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.169
to wage an attack.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.639
Wait, seriously?

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.839
This is character
assassination, Mr. Chalk,

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.123
they don't pull punches.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.603
During an otherwise normal meeting,

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:07.143
Senise's alarm will sound.

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:12.549
The trust and empathy
that she has built up

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:15.653
will cause you and the others
to come back to her defense.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.723
In the fracas, you may be captured.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.360
More than likely, you'll be killed.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.279
All of the mounting evidence
will undoubtedly force

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.229
the others to come clean
about the secret meetings

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:35.969
and to testify for their own sake

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:39.479
that you were a dangerous individual.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.409
He seemed like such a nice, normal guy.

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:44.249
Very hostile.

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.789
You take that man down.

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:49.329
I believe Ed
Kowalski already has experience

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:52.423
giving depositions pertaining
to his acquaintances.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.179
Lincoln Chalk.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.339
Lincoln Chalk.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:00.451
You find the man who
killed my wife, you find him!

01:12:00.452 --> 01:12:01.518
Lincoln Chalk.

01:12:01.519 --> 01:12:02.649
Lincoln Chalk!

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:05.073
Mm-hmm, Lincoln.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.970
Lincoln.

01:12:07.971 --> 01:12:12.409
As with Osama bin Laden, you
will be laid to rest at sea

01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:15.009
so that your grave site won't be

01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:17.663
a focal point for extremists.

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.469
I, uh,

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:23.239
I can't believe Senise was
playing us this whole time.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.952
So you actually want me
to go to this meeting

01:12:25.953 --> 01:12:27.499
and let all of this play out.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.099
It's the best chance
we're ever going to have

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.033
to expose this program as
the sham that it really is.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.784
Please, trust us.

01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:02.123
So who is Paul?

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:08.679
You're never gonna believe this.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.899
I got some info on Clara.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.873
Be careful what you say, Ed.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.829
There are ears in the
walls and eyes in the sky.

01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:19.830
I agree.

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:22.770
I think.

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:24.989
What?

01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:28.529
We've all been a little
bit too trusting, it seems.

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:29.530
Ah.

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:34.249
Is that the way you're gonna play this?

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:36.469
Plant the seeds, make
me look like the bad guy

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:37.663
before it even begins?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.879
Are you two banging,
is that what this is?

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.079
I wish.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.613
But I'd never bang a government...

01:13:45.614 --> 01:13:48.019
Hello, grouplings, cellphones off,

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.220
we have a lot to get to.

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:51.699
What's going on here?

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.809
A bonding moment?

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:54.939
Don't let me interrupt.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.669
Senise here was just about to paint me

01:13:56.670 --> 01:14:00.879
as a violent madman, but you
might know that already, huh?

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.299
I mean, you are a government man, right?

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.385
Well, technically, I'm
an independent contractor.

01:14:05.386 --> 01:14:06.509
Don't worry, Mike.

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.079
We all know you would never
blow Lincoln's identity

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.339
as an informant.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:14.479
He's on your side, right?

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.249
Well, I like to think
we're all on the same side.

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.250
This is too good.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.919
When your alarm goes off,
you're gonna say that it was me,

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.063
and everyone will turn
against me, brilliant.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.449
I feel like I'm losing control here.

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:27.283
Maybe we should...

01:14:27.284 --> 01:14:28.779
Very tricky yourself.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.919
Saying exactly what's going to happen

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.463
so that when it does,
it'll make me look bad.

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:38.139
But anyone here can
figure out that the fact

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.129
that you know what's going to happen

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:44.079
must mean you're working for the feds.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.179
How about the hello game, anyone?

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.869
How about we just get
this show on the road

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:49.669
and let them decide for themselves?

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:50.503
Let's do this.

01:14:50.503 --> 01:14:51.503
Hit it, Mike.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.400
God, what am I thinking?

01:14:56.401 --> 01:14:58.829
This idiot doesn't know anything.

01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:00.640
Probably right about that.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.049
Which means it must be you.

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:05.089
Oh, you mean you.

01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:06.189
Make your alarm go off.

01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:07.809
Go for it.

01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:09.099
Do what you got to do.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.623
All right, guys, what in
the hell is going on here?

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:17.383
Now I'm confused.

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.989
So am I.

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:21.099
Maybe this whole thing is just...

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100
A huge mistake.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.369
Ho, Jeremy,

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:26.509
what were you talking about last night?

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:27.787
There's nothing wrong with...

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:30.530
What's going on?

01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:36.879
He did this, he's a spy,
he's been ratting on us

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.713
the whole time.

01:15:37.714 --> 01:15:39.069
All of that is 100% true,

01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:41.052
except put Senise's
name where my name was.

01:15:41.053 --> 01:15:43.679
Well one thing is for sure,
a SWAT team is on its way

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.729
to take away at least one
of us, maybe all of us,

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.049
so we better figure out what
the hell is going on, quick.

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:49.839
You don't think that it's
a coincidence that Senise

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.509
shows up the second that
Clara gets taken away?

01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:54.809
She's a plant, the only
reason Clara was taken away

01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:56.496
in the first place is because Senise...

01:15:56.497 --> 01:15:57.380
To make room.

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.213
Bingo.

01:15:58.214 --> 01:16:00.379
Holy shit, Lincoln's right.

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.290
Now it makes sense.

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:02.449
Senise is a spy?

01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:04.099
No, he's lying.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.499
I have proof.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.199
They wanted you all to believe
that I was planning an attack

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.179
so this very minute
they're planting evidence

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.199
in my apartment, and that
creepy guy at security

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.229
put a gun in my bag.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:16.129
Couldn't a gun in your
bag kinda go either way?

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:18.980
I mean, if you are a federal
agent, you would have a gun.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.073
It won't be loaded,
they're not that stupid.

01:16:31.227 --> 01:16:32.227
Voila.

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.089
There, are you all satisfied, huh?

01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:41.889
A SWAT team is about to
burst through that door

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:44.638
and take me away, and the
guy who made it all happen

01:16:44.639 --> 01:16:47.717
is trying to convince you that I'm a liar.

01:16:47.718 --> 01:16:50.289
I'm the one that has proof.

01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:52.009
Jeremy, tell them.

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:54.579
No idea what this crazy
bitch is talking about.

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.530
What?

01:16:55.531 --> 01:16:56.839
You are crazy.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.687
You are crazy!

01:16:58.688 --> 01:17:00.947
Yes, you are, you are crazy!

01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:05.253
Well lookie here.

01:17:06.662 --> 01:17:08.245
That is not mine.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.599
Yeah, whatever.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.389
I think maybe we should
let the authorities

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:13.409
work this out.

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:15.599
Not until we work this out first.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.204
Get outta my way, jockstrap.

01:17:17.205 --> 01:17:18.205
Ahhhh!

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:23.403
If what I now believe
true is in fact true,

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.753
then that gun isn't loaded.

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:34.376
Well, you got me there,
but I do have one of these.

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.839
Pack leader, this is
Lone Wolf, stand down.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.152
I got it covered from here.

01:17:46.153 --> 01:17:49.465
You know, I'd like to think
if you had any idea whatsoever

01:17:49.466 --> 01:17:51.599
that there was someone in the
vicinity with one of these,

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.759
you woulda taken your headbands off.

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.323
Since you're screwed anyway.

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:00.729
This one's loaded, I promise you.

01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:03.539
So nobody get any bright
ideas like trying to take off

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.689
your headbands once you
regain the use of your limbs.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:08.989
I mean, I'm gonna have to
kill all of you, but I'd hate

01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:11.919
to do that before I explain
the evil plan we had going.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.699
You know, just to rub it in.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.779
Please do, I'm so confused.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.129
I figured it out.

01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:20.709
Great timing, we've got him right

01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:23.059
where we want him, butthole.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.623
I'm so sorry, you guys.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:27.920
Especially you, Senise.

01:18:29.345 --> 01:18:33.409
So, Senise isn't a spy, I take it?

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:37.603
No, she's not a plant, she's a patsy.

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.049
Howard Hughes' love
child's assistant with all

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.259
the Swedish furniture was right.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.479
Lincoln, do you have brain damage?

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.209
The feds wanted to frame
one of us to look like

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:51.039
a crazed gunman, but they didn't want

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.013
a washed-up athlete, they
wanted an ex-child star.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.853
Tessman had the right
plan but the wrong person.

01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:02.219
Thank you for the
long-winded explanation.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.539
You know, what sucks for
you all is that if Lincoln

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.629
hadn't been given the wrong
information and the plan

01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:08.289
had gone the way it was supposed to,

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.699
the only one getting shot
in the head right now

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.149
would be Senise here.

01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:14.889
As it stands, I'm gonna
have to do all of you

01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:16.589
and make it look like she did it.

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:18.309
Can't take the chance
on the truth coming out.

01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:19.559
I'm sure you understand.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.799
If this means anything,
I'm still really,

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.109
really confused, so you
can probably spare me.

01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:25.829
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:27.969
I'll shoot you in the head
first, so you don't have

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:31.019
to see all your friends
get their heads blown off.

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.899
Lucky bastard.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.519
Actually, I'm probably gonna
have to shoot some of you

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.849
in other parts of the body
and let you bleed out.

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:38.426
I mean, nobody's gonna believe that

01:19:38.427 --> 01:19:41.369
a TGIF star was that good a shot.

01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:44.080
Am I right, am I right?

01:19:44.081 --> 01:19:49.081
Yes, of course I'm right, you're an idiot.

01:19:49.563 --> 01:19:50.816
Here we go.

01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:00.899
He went down on me.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.990
Get the gun!

01:20:01.991 --> 01:20:03.366
On me!

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:07.249
Why didn't I take the headband off?

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:08.250
Stupid!

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.133
What just happened?

01:20:16.134 --> 01:20:17.222
Who cares?

01:20:17.223 --> 01:20:19.449
Great, now all we have to do

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:21.961
is deal with that SWAT team out there.

01:20:21.962 --> 01:20:25.389
And the media, they're
all camped outside already.

01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:27.029
Told in advance by the feds, no doubt,

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:30.159
so they can broadcast their
big success to the world.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:33.459
They've already identified
Senise as the assailant.

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.359
Your neighbors describe
you as a quiet person

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.230
who keeps to herself.

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:38.879
Fuckers, he told me
they'd take care of us.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.713
Who?

01:20:39.714 --> 01:20:42.032
Someone that said they'd be there for us.

01:20:42.033 --> 01:20:43.989
And now they're not, story of my life.

01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:46.589
Hey, Mike, I don't
suppose you have any way

01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:48.800
of helping us out, do you, champ?

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:04.569
We'll figure something out.

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:05.720
We're in this together.

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:12.103
That's what really pisses me off.

01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:17.803
They tricked me into making
you all care about each other.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.499
You were all perfectly fine

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.579
and happy before I came along.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.229
It is interesting
that the key to our doom

01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:27.939
was us pulling together.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:30.839
The typical scheme is usually
to divide and conquer.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.309
It's ironic really.

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:36.679
It's kinda like Ethan
Frome finding his love

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:40.433
in a visitor he never wanted
and then ruining her life.

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.499
I am

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500
so

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.223
So sorry, you guys.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.480
Fuck that.

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.060
Ed's right.

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.163
If their plan was to unite us,

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.803
let's show them that their
plan worked a little too well.

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.493
I'm tired of being told I'm a freak.

01:22:05.686 --> 01:22:08.423
It's time we stand up
for our way of lives.

01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:14.473
It's time we stand up
for our right to be alone.

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:16.992
Together.

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:20.863
Loners on three.

01:22:20.864 --> 01:22:21.930
One, two.

01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:22.989
Loners.

01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:24.073
Sorry, was I early?

01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:32.459
Call your boss, whoever that is,

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.279
and tell him to get in here.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.333
We needa talk.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:38.869
You know, like, when you're able.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.869
Ha, hear that, Delgado?

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.381
Get it done.

01:22:54.091 --> 01:22:55.409
What are your demands?

01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:59.329
Demands makes it sound like
it's a hostage situation.

01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:00.399
It's not.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.659
Okay, well what do
you want for Christmas?

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.516
Set up Jeremy, or
whatever his real name is,

01:23:06.517 --> 01:23:08.579
and say we're the ones who stopped him.

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.859
That's ridiculous, we
can't take the chance

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.699
that any one of you will
blow the whole thing

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.899
someday for some six-figure book deal.

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.739
Looks like you're gonna have to.

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.689
What's the alternative, killing all of us?

01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:21.289
There's a lotta cameras
out there, Delgado,

01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:23.609
that need an end to this
story, a bloodbath is not

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:25.859
gonna look good for the program.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.089
What do you all want in return?

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:32.359
To be taken off the watch
list, for one, permanently.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.526
That's all we ever wanted.

01:23:33.527 --> 01:23:35.621
And you have to let Clara go.

01:23:35.622 --> 01:23:37.839
You'll have to talk to
someone else about that.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.309
On her way to our facility,
our agents were ambushed

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:43.873
and she was liberated.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.381
I'm guessing that was the work
of your friends, Mr. Chalk.

01:23:48.382 --> 01:23:49.499
Oh.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.229
Don't suppose you can
tell me anything about

01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:53.179
the secret organization that's destroying

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.819
my career, is there?

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:58.429
I had a hood over my
head the whole time.

01:23:58.430 --> 01:24:00.209
I never saw a thing.

01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:01.589
You expect me to believe that?

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:04.140
I expect that it doesn't
matter what you believe.

01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:06.749
You think you can play the bad guy

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.653
for a little while longer?

01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:14.330
Fine.

01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:18.540
But if any of this

01:24:19.530 --> 01:24:20.883
ever leaves this room,

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.859
you all suffer,

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.410
not just the one who leaked it.

01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.620
That understood?

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.769
My most embarrassing failure

01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:34.169
was not seeing earlier the
imbecile you truly are.

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:37.629
Come on, you're not
gonna be a part of this.

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:39.283
Part of what?

01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:41.970
Exactly.

01:25:08.781 --> 01:25:13.781
Yeah, baby, yeah!

01:25:16.141 --> 01:25:17.229
You know, you play this right,

01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:19.270
I bet you get some acting jobs outta this.

01:25:19.271 --> 01:25:20.809
Oh, we can all get something outta this,

01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:22.300
whatever we want.

01:25:22.301 --> 01:25:23.889
I feel like I'm losing what I want.

01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:25.699
What do you mean, Dabney?

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.779
It wasn't until I was
officially called a loner

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.224
I finally had friends.

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.379
Now you're, you're all leaving.

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:35.619
You know, we never
actually did play poker.

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:38.620
You'll never get tired of
taking people's money, will you?

01:25:39.713 --> 01:25:42.709
I do think it's probably a good idea

01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:44.629
that we all stay in touch.

01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:46.469
Can't believe I'm gonna
say this, but I propose

01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:49.299
that we get together
every once in a while.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.289
We could call it a support group.

01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:53.369
Say, once a week?

01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:54.773
We can meet at my place.

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:57.033
Sound good, Dabney?

01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840
Sounds good.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.640
Whoo.

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.653
Well, get ready to
smile for the cameras.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.400
Let's go, guys.

01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:18.253
Hey, you know the one thing I don't get?

01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:23.293
How did Jeremy get tased?

01:26:26.503 --> 01:26:29.039
Musta been one of the Hughes
people, but I don't know how.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.139
You can't exactly get your
hands on those tasers,

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.523
and you have to be at close range.

01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:45.793
Holy shit.

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.869
Give Paige a high
position in whatever branch

01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:54.509
she wants, and check on
Clara from time to time

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:56.023
to make sure she's doing well.

01:26:57.750 --> 01:27:00.740
We didn't fully succeed
in ending the war, but

01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:03.123
I feel like we did some good.

01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:06.010
No.

01:27:07.215 --> 01:27:08.665
I feel like we can trust him.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.860
In his heart, he believes in our struggle.

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:15.573
Headband or not, Lincoln
Chalk is a true loner.

01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:17.530
They all are.

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.400
God bless them.

01:27:20.297 --> 01:27:21.673
The best people on Earth.

01:27:23.437 --> 01:27:24.975
Good night, Tessman.
