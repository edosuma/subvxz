WEBVTT

00:04.450 --> 00:08.986
Guys, there are actual
stewardesses out there,

00:09.054 --> 00:11.421
and one of them talked to me.

00:11.489 --> 00:14.067
I made this joke about
how they just flew in...

00:14.134 --> 00:17.319
And their arms must be tired.

00:18.178 --> 00:20.388
Yeah, great.

00:20.456 --> 00:24.741
Kelso, their neckerchiefs are undone.

00:24.809 --> 00:27.805
You can see their necks.

00:27.873 --> 00:30.990
Look, I don't have time
for stewardess neck.

00:31.058 --> 00:32.186
I gotta study.

00:32.188 --> 00:35.429
They're really riding me down at the
police academy and I don't know why.

00:35.496 --> 00:37.933
I know why. It's fun.

00:39.346 --> 00:42.613
They even chose me last to
work on the c.P.R. Dummy,

00:42.680 --> 00:46.320
so everybody's spit was all over it.

00:46.388 --> 00:48.138
Yo, even Johnson's spit,

00:48.206 --> 00:50.790
and he's got a monster cold sore.

00:50.858 --> 00:52.808
I know why they're doing that.

00:52.876 --> 00:54.524
I bet you're the stooge.

00:54.591 --> 00:55.973
What?

00:55.974 --> 00:57.081
Every year the police academy

00:57.148 --> 00:58.762
lets one guy in they know will fail out.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.811
They use him to scare the other cadets.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.199
I know 'cause my brother was a stooge.

01:04.266 --> 01:06.955
All right, fine. It was me.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.571
Oh, man, I'm the stooge!

01:09.639 --> 01:11.960
Hey, come on. Kelso, if that were true,

01:12.028 --> 01:14.708
you'd have had to have been
a screw-up your whole life.

01:14.782 --> 01:18.874
I mean, sure, you've fallen
off the water tower...

01:18.942 --> 01:22.054
Every year... since junior high.

01:22.121 --> 01:25.027
And you broke your arm wrestling a dog.

01:25.095 --> 01:29.983
And, heck, no one's eaten
more change than you.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.993
All right, I gotta
say, you guys are making

01:32.061 --> 01:34.237
a pretty good case that I'm the stooge!

01:34.305 --> 01:35.576
Well, if you're not,

01:35.644 --> 01:37.252
there's a guy who's
about to step on a rake

01:37.320 --> 01:38.995
that I really want to meet.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

02:09.592 --> 02:11.832
Hello, Wisconsin!

02:19.564 --> 02:23.966
I can't believe I'm the stooge!

02:24.034 --> 02:26.802
Michael, it's just the
way some people are, okay?

02:26.870 --> 02:29.204
Some people are lazy.
Some people are clumsy.

02:29.272 --> 02:31.339
Some people are stooges.

02:32.575 --> 02:34.643
You're lucky enough to be all three.

02:38.281 --> 02:40.649
Kelso, keep in mind you're
being called a stooge

02:40.716 --> 02:42.350
by a stooge

02:42.418 --> 02:45.653
while a third stooge sits idly by.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.155
Compliment... accepted.

02:58.231 --> 03:00.968
Now, listen, you nincompoops.

03:01.036 --> 03:04.536
These pies are for some
very important clients.

03:04.603 --> 03:06.604
Nothing should happen
to these pies. Got that?

03:06.672 --> 03:08.172
Sure thing, boss.

03:11.943 --> 03:14.944
Nice going, you knucklehead.
Now we gotta wash 'em.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.214
Want to give me a hand?

03:18.281 --> 03:21.216
Bravo! Bravo!

03:21.284 --> 03:25.086
Ah, so we got a wise guy, huh?

03:37.397 --> 03:39.097
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!

03:50.708 --> 03:52.775
Oh, yeah?

03:52.843 --> 03:54.310
Take this!

03:54.377 --> 03:57.512
How's it going with those...

04:01.249 --> 04:02.816
Pies?

04:09.522 --> 04:12.090
Ugh. The three stooges have such bad hair.

04:13.857 --> 04:14.177
You know, I wish I could go back in time

04:14.178 --> 04:17.713
for just 10 minutes and
hand out combs and brushes.

04:19.281 --> 04:21.615
Guys, can we focus here?

04:21.683 --> 04:23.650
I gotta figure out if
I'm the stooge or not.

04:23.717 --> 04:26.185
Well, why don't you just, like,
ask your Captain or something?

04:26.253 --> 04:29.888
He won't tell me. That's the whole point.

04:29.956 --> 04:32.794
I gotta get a look at my file,

04:32.861 --> 04:35.796
which means I gotta break
into the police academy.

04:37.065 --> 04:40.534
Okay, you see how you took
something that made sense

04:40.601 --> 04:42.736
and then made it weird?

04:42.804 --> 04:45.672
That's part of the problem.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.174
That's what I like about you, kelso.

04:47.242 --> 04:49.510
You can make a mess out of anything.

04:49.578 --> 04:50.878
I'm in.

04:52.147 --> 04:54.515
Yeah, well, not me. Breaking into a place

04:54.583 --> 04:56.517
where they train people to shoot you

04:56.585 --> 04:58.285
if you break into a place...

04:59.421 --> 05:02.221
Come on, Eric. We're a team.

05:02.289 --> 05:04.689
Yeah, Michael's the
looks. Steven's the brain.

05:04.757 --> 05:07.621
And you, your house has food.

05:07.688 --> 05:11.889
Hey, remember when we
shoplifted those baseball cards?

05:11.957 --> 05:14.391
We were 12 years old.

05:14.459 --> 05:16.960
And I didn't shoplift anything.

05:17.027 --> 05:19.895
That's right. You went
home and told your mommy.

05:21.130 --> 05:22.997
You mama's boy.

05:23.065 --> 05:26.833
Well, did you want that
on your permanent record?

05:26.901 --> 05:29.602
Yeah, I didn't think so, mister.

05:31.171 --> 05:33.339
Oh, God, I am a mama's boy. I'm in.

05:37.677 --> 05:40.713
Now, the secret to really good Fudge

05:40.780 --> 05:43.481
is a tiny bit of Kahlua.

05:46.419 --> 05:48.353
You must make a lot of Fudge,

05:48.421 --> 05:50.622
'cause the bottle's almost empty.

05:50.690 --> 05:55.259
Well, it's a tiny bit
of Kahlua for the Fudge,

05:55.327 --> 05:57.262
a tiny bit for the chef.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.998
Ha ha ha ha!

06:00.065 --> 06:02.933
That's how you make cooking fun.

06:04.219 --> 06:07.387
Apparently, it also works
for sewing and laundry

06:07.454 --> 06:10.389
and sitting around watching tv.

06:12.926 --> 06:15.359
Okay, the I.N.S. Called. I have to go in

06:15.427 --> 06:18.062
for a final review before
I can pick up my green card.

06:18.129 --> 06:20.698
I bet they give you a
test on U.S. history.

06:20.765 --> 06:23.600
See, America is strict
about who we let in here

06:23.667 --> 06:26.569
'cause we have stuff
that people want to steal.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.871
Unlike your lesser countries,
like Canada and France.

06:36.211 --> 06:37.211
See?

06:37.279 --> 06:40.646
This is when a Bobby pin comes in handy.

06:40.713 --> 06:43.011
Why do you have a Bobby pin?

06:43.079 --> 06:46.213
I'm training my hair, okay?

06:46.281 --> 06:49.783
I want more wave, less fluff.

06:49.850 --> 06:51.451
Guys, this is serious.

06:51.518 --> 06:53.753
Let's just find my file
and get out of here.

06:53.821 --> 06:55.223
Hey, what's in here?

06:55.291 --> 06:56.725
It's the k-9 training room.

06:56.793 --> 06:58.994
It's where they keep all the samples

06:59.061 --> 07:01.864
to teach the police
dogs what to sniff for.

07:04.835 --> 07:06.769
Oh, man, these samples

07:06.837 --> 07:09.605
are way better than our samples.

07:09.673 --> 07:12.141
Did you see how quickly
I sniffed them out?

07:12.208 --> 07:14.677
I could so be a police dog.

07:15.912 --> 07:18.280
Cool. Training collar.

07:18.348 --> 07:21.181
You know, I still don't get how
they could think I'm a stooge.

07:21.249 --> 07:23.183
I'm, like, so on top of everything.

07:23.251 --> 07:24.850
What's this thing do?

07:24.918 --> 07:26.017
Oh!

07:26.085 --> 07:28.552
Give me that, kelso!

07:28.620 --> 07:30.254
You're gonna hurt yourself.

07:33.225 --> 07:35.625
Quit it, Hyde. That really hurts.

07:35.693 --> 07:37.626
Okay, do it one more time.

07:48.204 --> 07:50.839
Okay, so this is George Washington,

07:50.907 --> 07:52.974
the father of our country.

07:53.041 --> 07:55.609
Well, George and I have
one thing in common.

07:55.677 --> 07:59.012
We both look good in a powdered white wig.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.483
Okay, so, fez, the statue of liberty

08:04.551 --> 08:06.485
was a gift from the French.

08:06.552 --> 08:09.387
The French? I didn't know that.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.156
You didn't know that?

08:11.223 --> 08:13.758
I really don't think
it's common knowledge.

08:13.825 --> 08:17.126
Okay, I painted my nails
through two semesters

08:17.194 --> 08:19.328
of American history, and even I knew that.

08:19.396 --> 08:21.830
Well, don't I feel like the hillbilly

08:21.898 --> 08:24.766
who wandered into town.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.200
Well, it's no big deal, Mrs. Forman.

08:26.268 --> 08:28.202
Oh, I see. It's no big deal

08:28.270 --> 08:30.204
for you smart people who know everything.

08:30.272 --> 08:32.206
But for us hillbillies,

08:32.274 --> 08:34.207
well, we're lucky if we
know how to tie our shoes

08:34.275 --> 08:36.543
and flush the toilet.

08:36.610 --> 08:39.144
Okay, Mrs. Forman, please don't get upset.

08:39.212 --> 08:40.611
Okay, here.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.780
Drink some more Fudge.

08:47.418 --> 08:49.818
Okay, so...

08:49.886 --> 08:51.954
The constitution was ratified...

08:52.021 --> 08:53.288
Oh, I know this.

08:53.356 --> 08:54.856
1776.

08:54.923 --> 08:57.958
Oh, you're thinking of the
declaration of independence.

08:58.025 --> 08:59.358
See, the
constitution was...

08:59.426 --> 09:01.361
I know what the constitution is.

09:01.429 --> 09:02.863
Can you make Fudge?

09:02.931 --> 09:03.932
What?

09:03.999 --> 09:06.838
Then can it.

09:06.906 --> 09:08.874
Okay, what if they ask
me about current events?

09:08.942 --> 09:10.676
Tell me about Vietnam.

09:10.743 --> 09:12.777
Okay, so Vietnam was an
illegal war which we lost.

09:12.845 --> 09:16.212
What the hell are you teaching him?

09:17.081 --> 09:20.082
You, come with me.

09:21.384 --> 09:23.786
I'll teach you the real American history.

09:23.853 --> 09:25.787
First of all, we didn't lose the war.

09:25.855 --> 09:27.556
It was a tie.

09:29.025 --> 09:30.959
Besides, they're grateful.

09:31.027 --> 09:33.528
They have McDonald's now.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.098
Here's my file.

09:38.165 --> 09:41.100
It doesn't say "stooge" anywhere.

09:42.636 --> 09:45.605
Oh, good picture, but that's no shocker.

09:45.673 --> 09:47.706
But this is...

09:47.774 --> 09:50.509
Aah!

09:50.576 --> 09:52.243
I think the batteries are starting to go.

09:52.311 --> 09:53.811
That one didn't hurt as much.

09:53.878 --> 09:56.578
You better let me hold on to this file.

09:56.646 --> 09:58.079
I don't leave any fingerprints,

09:58.147 --> 10:00.849
thanks to my cool new black gloves.

10:00.916 --> 10:05.318
Man, if only these shot webs.

10:07.387 --> 10:09.554
Aren't those your mom's isotoners?

10:12.290 --> 10:14.225
All right, guys, I gotta figure out

10:14.292 --> 10:16.527
if I'm in trouble or not.

10:17.495 --> 10:20.263
What the hell is going on in here?

10:21.299 --> 10:25.101
I'm gonna go with you're in trouble.

10:35.296 --> 10:38.597
Cadet kelso, do you
know what the penalty is

10:38.665 --> 10:40.432
for breaking into the academy office?

10:40.500 --> 10:43.134
No, sir, officer Kennedy, sir!

10:43.201 --> 10:44.635
There are none,

10:44.703 --> 10:47.537
because nobody's been
stupid enough to do it!

10:47.604 --> 10:51.509
All right! You're first in your class.

10:54.345 --> 10:58.381
Is that a dog training
collar around your neck?

11:00.618 --> 11:03.153
Oh, um, you're probably gonna want this.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.656
It's the red button.

11:06.724 --> 11:09.559
Look, sir, I think you should know

11:09.626 --> 11:11.226
that at the last police charity auction,

11:11.294 --> 11:13.628
my family bought one of your
Christmas tree ornaments...

11:13.696 --> 11:15.696
Santa driving a cop car.

11:15.764 --> 11:19.433
Funniest thing on the tree. It was.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.534
Anyway, please don't call my mom and dad.

11:21.602 --> 11:23.169
Thanks.

11:23.237 --> 11:24.837
What's your name?

11:24.905 --> 11:27.172
They call me fez.

11:29.241 --> 11:32.576
Officer Kennedy, sir, I broke in

11:32.643 --> 11:35.645
to find out if I was
the stooge or not, sir.

11:35.713 --> 11:38.148
You're not the stooge.
Johnson's the stooge.

11:38.215 --> 11:40.419
Yes.

11:40.486 --> 11:43.822
But you're the stooge now.

11:45.926 --> 11:49.295
Okay, I think that we've
been reviewing long enough.

11:49.363 --> 11:51.631
Let's see what you've learned.

11:51.699 --> 11:53.833
I'll start you off with an easy one.

11:53.901 --> 11:55.701
Where do you live?

11:55.769 --> 11:57.637
Ame-dee-ca.

11:57.705 --> 12:01.507
It's pronounced America.

12:01.575 --> 12:03.809
That's what I
said. Ame-dee-ca.

12:03.877 --> 12:06.710
America!

12:06.778 --> 12:09.045
Ame-dee-ca.

12:10.812 --> 12:12.880
Why do we celebrate the 4th of July?

12:12.948 --> 12:15.249
Because we are damn glad not to be a bunch

12:15.317 --> 12:17.452
of British tea-drinking
nancy-pants.

12:17.519 --> 12:21.589
Nobody's gonna argue with that answer.

12:24.090 --> 12:27.155
A-mer-I-ca!

12:27.222 --> 12:31.156
A-me-dee-ca!

12:31.223 --> 12:33.791
America!

12:33.859 --> 12:36.126
Ame-dee-ca!

12:37.628 --> 12:39.162
What was president

12:39.230 --> 12:42.032
Dwight d. Eisenhower's
greatest achievement?

12:42.099 --> 12:44.033
He led the allies to
victory in world war ii

12:44.101 --> 12:46.235
and sent those jackbooted
Nazi bastards home

12:46.303 --> 12:48.671
to cry in their Sauerkraut.

12:48.739 --> 12:53.775
I didn't understand a word you said,

12:53.843 --> 12:57.110
but I heard "nazi bastards,"
and that's good enough for me.

13:00.145 --> 13:02.611
America!

13:02.678 --> 13:05.642
Ame-dee-ca!

13:05.710 --> 13:10.346
Look, there is no damn "d" in "america"!

13:11.880 --> 13:15.182
Say my son's name.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.253
Eric.

13:20.624 --> 13:23.593
Great.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.561
Now...

13:25.629 --> 13:27.630
America.

13:27.698 --> 13:30.199
Ame-dee-ca.

13:30.266 --> 13:33.667
Just forget it.

13:33.734 --> 13:35.835
Just say "united States."

13:35.903 --> 13:39.972
United States...
Of ame-dee-ca.

13:44.177 --> 13:47.180
Guys, I'm really screwed
down at the police academy.

13:47.247 --> 13:49.182
Officer Kennedy told me
he's looking for any reason

13:49.250 --> 13:50.650
to kick me out.

13:50.717 --> 13:53.482
Okay, but did he say anything
about calling my parents?

13:55.685 --> 13:58.620
I was so freaked out
that I completely blew

13:58.688 --> 14:00.555
this exam this morning.

14:00.623 --> 14:02.224
I'm sure you did fine.

14:02.292 --> 14:04.293
Roy, the first question

14:04.361 --> 14:07.560
was "stop in the name of the blank."

14:07.628 --> 14:09.427
And I wrote "love."

14:09.495 --> 14:11.863
God!

14:12.898 --> 14:15.065
I don't care what they say, kelso.

14:15.133 --> 14:19.134
Love is always the right answer.

14:19.202 --> 14:21.136
So you screwed up a test, man.

14:21.204 --> 14:22.639
You know what you have to do.

14:22.706 --> 14:25.407
Yeah, yeah, study more next time.

14:25.474 --> 14:28.109
What are you, Forman?

14:28.177 --> 14:30.545
You gotta break in there
and change the answers.

14:30.612 --> 14:34.047
I can't break in there again.

14:34.115 --> 14:37.784
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

14:37.851 --> 14:40.119
That's why they'll never expect it, man.

14:40.187 --> 14:43.021
Look, they don't know
you got a friend like me

14:43.089 --> 14:46.491
to talk you into doing something
so fundamentally moronic.

14:46.559 --> 14:50.227
That's true.

14:50.295 --> 14:52.263
You know what? I'm in, too.

14:52.330 --> 14:54.198
I know it's dangerous, but...

14:54.266 --> 14:57.668
I just really like wearing that outfit.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.669
Trust me, it'll work.

14:59.737 --> 15:01.604
How do you think I got through chemistry?

15:01.672 --> 15:03.606
Hey, you told me you
blackmailed the teacher

15:03.674 --> 15:05.941
'cause you caught him
smoking up behind the gym.

15:06.009 --> 15:09.177
Oh, yeah.

15:09.245 --> 15:11.946
How do you think I got through biology?

15:19.854 --> 15:22.689
Fez, relax. You're gonna pass the test.

15:22.757 --> 15:25.825
No, this could be my
last day in the country.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.960
We should probably make love.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.195
What?

15:30.262 --> 15:32.896
Don't worry. It'll be
over before you know it.

15:32.964 --> 15:36.632
So, on the way back from the bathroom,

15:36.700 --> 15:38.900
I got proposed to 3 times.

15:38.968 --> 15:41.435
I must look more gorgeous than usual.

15:41.502 --> 15:44.170
Jackie, the only reason
they want to marry you

15:44.238 --> 15:45.804
is so they can stay in the country.

15:45.872 --> 15:47.506
Jealous.

15:49.341 --> 15:52.476
Okay. Here I go.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.513
I'm here for my test.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.013
Where do I sign in, or should I say,

15:59.081 --> 16:02.314
where do I put my John hancock?

16:03.649 --> 16:06.720
Actually, I will sign my name.

16:06.787 --> 16:08.021
That's just a common expression.

16:08.089 --> 16:09.357
I know so much history,

16:09.425 --> 16:11.892
I just drop it into everyday conversation.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.226
There is no test.

16:13.294 --> 16:15.994
I just need to see that
you are who you say you are

16:16.062 --> 16:17.996
and that you're in the country to be

16:18.063 --> 16:19.730
with your wife Laurie Forman.

16:19.798 --> 16:22.165
No test? So that's it?

16:22.233 --> 16:24.570
I'm truly really a citizen
of this great country?

16:24.638 --> 16:26.574
Just as soon as I stamp this paper.

16:26.642 --> 16:27.878
Oh, this is great.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.379
You and I should go celebrate.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.380
Let's start out with a couple
of drinks and some lovemaking

16:31.448 --> 16:33.815
and see where it goes from there.

16:35.117 --> 16:37.851
I don't date married men.

16:37.918 --> 16:40.386
Well, let's just say that as
soon as I get my green card,

16:40.454 --> 16:42.054
I will be single.

16:42.121 --> 16:46.323
Then you can explore the country of fez.

16:46.391 --> 16:48.324
Hold on. Are you telling me

16:48.392 --> 16:50.326
your marriage is a sham?

16:50.393 --> 16:51.660
I'm telling you

16:51.728 --> 16:54.564
your eyes are like Amber waves of grain.

16:54.631 --> 16:58.302
You do realize I haven't stamped this yet.

17:00.575 --> 17:02.644
Actually, I had not.

17:05.584 --> 17:07.017
Oh, he looks happy.

17:07.085 --> 17:09.453
Yeah, I bet he's doing great. Yeah.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.357
Shouldn't you stamp my paper now?

17:12.424 --> 17:13.424
I don't think so.

17:13.492 --> 17:14.724
In a minute? Nope.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.226
After lunch? Unh-unh.

17:16.294 --> 17:19.529
Would you like me to stamp it?

17:21.498 --> 17:23.897
Red, do you think I'm smart?

17:23.964 --> 17:27.300
Oh, is that what we're gonna
do today, we're gonna fight?

17:29.972 --> 17:32.040
Great news. I got my green card.

17:32.108 --> 17:35.677
I am now officially a yankee doodle dandy.

17:35.744 --> 17:38.778
So you passed the test, huh?

17:38.846 --> 17:40.046
No, there was no test.

17:40.114 --> 17:41.180
No test?

17:41.248 --> 17:45.383
Oh, we're just as bad as Canada.

17:45.450 --> 17:47.784
So, what happened?

17:47.852 --> 17:50.054
Well, you know how sometimes
I come on a little strong

17:50.122 --> 17:51.323
to the ladies?

17:51.390 --> 17:54.993
You can be a little handsy.

17:55.061 --> 17:56.994
It was touch-and-go
for a while,

17:57.062 --> 17:59.863
but eventually, I won the
I.N.S. Lady over with my charm.

17:59.931 --> 18:01.964
More like you cried until she felt bad

18:02.032 --> 18:03.967
and stamped your papers.

18:04.034 --> 18:07.806
Hey, tomato, potato- -
it's all the same thing.

18:09.475 --> 18:12.476
Bottom line is I
have cha-dees-ma.

18:12.544 --> 18:13.810
Charisma!

18:13.878 --> 18:16.012
Yes,
cha-dees-ma.

18:19.249 --> 18:22.684
Man, I love these gloves.

18:22.752 --> 18:25.687
I wish there was some
diamond protected by lasers

18:25.755 --> 18:27.822
I could steal.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.323
Okay, I'm almost done.

18:29.391 --> 18:32.926
I just gotta think of
one more misdemeanor.

18:32.994 --> 18:35.962
Oh, breaking into the police academy.

18:36.030 --> 18:38.631
All right, come on. Let's go.

18:43.201 --> 18:46.036
How do you keep finding us?!

18:47.304 --> 18:50.806
I'm wearing all black!

18:50.874 --> 18:53.609
I sleep right next door.

18:53.676 --> 18:55.144
What's the problem, trouble with the wife?

18:55.211 --> 18:56.378
Shut up.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.081
That's it. You're outta here.

19:00.149 --> 19:01.883
Wait. I can explain.

19:01.951 --> 19:06.154
Okay, this whole thing
started because I just...

19:06.222 --> 19:08.256
I can't be the stooge.

19:08.324 --> 19:10.859
Okay? I'm gonna be a dad soon,

19:10.927 --> 19:12.861
and no kid is gonna look up to his dad

19:12.928 --> 19:14.829
if his dad is the stooge.

19:14.897 --> 19:16.998
Well, unless the kid's a stooge,

19:17.066 --> 19:20.068
in which case I wouldn't love him anyway.

19:22.205 --> 19:24.139
You're gonna be a father?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.374
Who would breed with you?!

19:27.843 --> 19:31.646
One night stand, both a little drunk.

19:31.714 --> 19:34.816
Look, I know I messed up.

19:34.884 --> 19:39.488
But can't you just... maybe...

19:39.555 --> 19:41.490
Give me one more chance?

19:41.557 --> 19:43.991
All right. Since you're gonna be a father,

19:44.059 --> 19:45.989
I'm gonna let what happened here slide.

19:46.056 --> 19:47.986
But just so you don't do this again,

19:48.053 --> 19:50.982
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

19:51.050 --> 19:52.682
There is no stooge.

19:52.749 --> 19:54.650
What?

19:54.718 --> 19:56.685
That's just a rumor we started

19:56.752 --> 19:58.687
to get the cadets to work harder.

19:58.755 --> 20:01.991
Also... there's no alligator in the lake.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.796
Wait, wait, wait. If there's no stooge,

20:07.864 --> 20:09.297
then how come our friend Roy told us

20:09.365 --> 20:11.799
he got kicked out of the
academy for being a stooge?

20:11.867 --> 20:14.201
Roy keene?

20:14.269 --> 20:16.570
He didn't get kicked
out for being a stooge.

20:16.638 --> 20:20.306
He got kicked out for
shooting the police horse.

20:20.374 --> 20:22.442
Look, cadet, all you have to do

20:22.509 --> 20:24.410
is work hard and you'll be fine.

20:24.478 --> 20:27.347
Now you clean up this
mess and get outta here.

20:33.787 --> 20:38.422
Well, I think we all learned
an important lesson here.

20:38.490 --> 20:39.490
If you're in trouble

20:39.557 --> 20:41.324
and your back's up against the wall,

20:41.392 --> 20:43.826
just tell 'em you got a kid.

20:46.362 --> 20:50.032
People are suckers for a baby.

20:50.099 --> 20:52.334
That is a valuable lesson.

20:52.402 --> 20:55.270
I think we should all reflect on that...

20:55.338 --> 20:58.072
In the k-9 training room.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.273
I call shock caller.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.541
I call buttons.

21:05.591 --> 21:06.858
Okay, miss smarty-pants.

21:06.925 --> 21:09.326
How about... ooh.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.860
Where was the famous tea party?

21:11.927 --> 21:12.860
Boston.

21:12.928 --> 21:13.994
Nope.

21:14.062 --> 21:15.999
What?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.339
Got it wrong. Sorry.

21:18.407 --> 21:21.716
It's the Boston tea party.

21:21.784 --> 21:26.321
No. It says right here it's
" the Boston tea party."

21:27.289 --> 21:28.723
Oh.

21:28.791 --> 21:30.392
Huh.

21:30.459 --> 21:32.828
I'm gonna have a long island tea party.
