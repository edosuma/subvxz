WEBVTT

00:13.796 --> 00:15.754
Garden's looking nice.

00:15.798 --> 00:20.455
Well, not to commit
the sin of pride, but I know.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.717
How did you come out of me?

00:21.760 --> 00:23.240
So, good news.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.068
John's coming home on Friday.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.156
That's wonderful.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.071
It is.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.072
You must be thrilled.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.161
Oh, I am.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.033
Mm. Little nervous?

00:33.076 --> 00:34.382
No. No.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.731
No.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.733
Be understandable
if you were.

00:37.776 --> 00:41.519
The man has been
in a mental institution.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.869
All I know is he sounded
like himself on the phone,

00:43.913 --> 00:46.481
and the doctors say
he's good to go.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.396
Well, that's great.

00:48.439 --> 00:51.616
It is. I'm excited.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.488
Well, good.

00:53.531 --> 00:56.447
Very excited.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.188
Okay.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.711
I'm gonna get another beer.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.626
'Cause you're so excited?

01:01.670 --> 01:03.715
You know it!

01:03.759 --> 01:06.631
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:06.675 --> 01:09.504
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:09.547 --> 01:12.246
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:12.289 --> 01:14.422
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:14.465 --> 01:18.730
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

01:21.385 --> 01:22.430
We need
to have a talk.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.475
Georgie,
get in here!

01:24.519 --> 01:25.911
Are we in trouble?

01:25.955 --> 01:27.565
No one's in trouble.

01:27.609 --> 01:28.392
What's going on?

01:28.436 --> 01:29.393
Have a seat.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.481
You're also getting
talked to.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.266
Sit.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.397
Ha.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.703
Okay,

01:34.746 --> 01:37.923
Dr. Sturgis will be
joining us for dinner.

01:37.967 --> 01:38.924
Hot darn.

01:38.968 --> 01:39.925
That guy's back?

01:39.969 --> 01:41.623
I thought he was
in the nut house.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.103
We do not call it that.

01:43.146 --> 01:44.495
That's what Dad calls it.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.149
And that's why I made him sit.

01:46.193 --> 01:50.153
We need to make sure that
Dr. Sturgis feels comfortable.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
And how are we supposed
to do that?

01:51.676 --> 01:54.810
For starters, do not bring up
his time in the hospital.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.246
What if he brings it up?

01:56.290 --> 01:58.814
You let the grown-ups
handle that.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.382
In this scenario,
am I one of the grown-ups?

02:01.425 --> 02:02.165
No.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.471
Great.
You also

02:03.514 --> 02:05.951
will not stare at him
during dinner.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.736
Can I look
at him at all?

02:07.779 --> 02:08.780
Yes.

02:08.824 --> 02:09.825
How long can
I look at him

02:09.868 --> 02:11.218
before it's
considered staring?

02:11.261 --> 02:12.654
When I'm trying
not to stare at girls,

02:12.697 --> 02:14.743
my rule is
"two Mississippi."

02:14.786 --> 02:16.179
I taught him that.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.441
MARY:
Just be

02:17.485 --> 02:18.964
on your best behavior.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.532
And if you're not sure
if you should say something,

02:21.576 --> 02:23.360
do not say it.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.102
What?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.321
Hey, it works.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.975
When I hit three
Mississippis, she noticed.

02:30.019 --> 02:30.976
See?

02:31.020 --> 02:33.022
Told you.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.200
Meemaw and Dr. Sturgis
are out front.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.333
They're walking up the path.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.204
They see me.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.553
I'm waving.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.903
They waved back.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.341
They're close to the door.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.212
Even closer.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.735
Almost there.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.389
Door...

02:52.433 --> 02:53.912
...bell!

02:53.956 --> 02:56.001
Remember everything
we talked about.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.481
Welcome!

02:57.525 --> 02:59.440
Look who I brought!

02:59.483 --> 03:00.615
Hello!

03:00.658 --> 03:02.356
Come in,
come in.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.053
It's so good to see you.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.968
I don't normally
do this, but...

03:06.011 --> 03:07.448
put her there.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.753
No mitten.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.451
I'm honored.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.242
It's just so wonderful
to see you all again.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.244
We've been looking
forward to it.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.245
We sure have.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.377
One Mississippi,

03:23.420 --> 03:24.856
two Mississippi.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.210
Uh, why are
you counting?

03:30.253 --> 03:32.429
You know Shelly.
He loves his numbers.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.430
Let's say grace.

03:34.910 --> 03:38.261
Bless us, Lord, for the food
we are about to receive

03:38.305 --> 03:40.350
and bless the hands
that prepared it. Amen.

03:40.394 --> 03:41.525
OTHERS:
Amen.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.961
Dig in.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.703
Oh, I am so excited
to have a home-cooked meal.

03:45.747 --> 03:49.968
The food in the hospital
was bland-arino.

03:51.143 --> 03:54.451
Uh, be sure to save
room for dessert.

03:54.495 --> 03:55.844
I made banana pudding.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.194
George, tell him how good
my banana pudding is.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.196
Good pudding.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.589
Lot of bananas.

04:01.632 --> 04:02.720
STURGIS:
Well, now,

04:02.764 --> 04:04.853
pardon me if
I'm wrong, but...

04:04.896 --> 04:08.944
I would totally understand
if any of you felt uncomfortable

04:08.987 --> 04:10.946
about me being here
after my time

04:10.989 --> 04:12.513
in the hospital.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.602
Oh, no,
we're very comfortable.

04:14.645 --> 04:15.994
Very comfortable.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.083
Well, just in case,

04:18.127 --> 04:19.911
I want you all to know

04:19.955 --> 04:22.392
I'm perfectly happy
to answer any questions

04:22.436 --> 04:23.959
that you might have.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.354
You sure you want
to do that?

04:27.397 --> 04:28.529
Of course.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.966
The best way
to destigmatize something

04:31.009 --> 04:32.533
is to talk about it.

04:33.577 --> 04:34.622
May I?

04:35.623 --> 04:38.452
Um, go ahead.

04:39.888 --> 04:43.326
Why wasn't I allowed
to visit you?

04:43.370 --> 04:44.936
Some of the other
patients there

04:44.980 --> 04:46.938
were very unwell,

04:46.982 --> 04:51.160
and I didn't want you to be
disturbed by their behavior.

04:52.857 --> 04:53.945
I got one.

04:53.989 --> 04:54.946
Here we go.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.166
Did they lock you up
in a room?

04:57.209 --> 04:59.473
I wasn't able
to leave the hospital

04:59.516 --> 05:00.735
without being discharged,

05:00.778 --> 05:03.564
but I was free
to walk the grounds.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.611
How did you know when
you were all better?

05:07.655 --> 05:09.309
Well, it's not
like a cold,

05:09.352 --> 05:11.441
where you have it
and then you don't.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.835
But I've learned
skills that, uh,

05:13.878 --> 05:16.533
help me to manage
my mental health.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.144
Well, that went over my head.

05:19.188 --> 05:20.537
I got another one.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.539
In The Shining,
Jack Nicholson goes nuts

05:22.583 --> 05:24.541
and chases people around
with an ax...

05:24.585 --> 05:25.586
One question each.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.630
Dang it.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.415
Should've started
with that one.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.374
MEEMAW:
How 'bout a little nightcap?

05:31.418 --> 05:33.289
Oh, I don't think so.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.596
Got to ride the old bike home.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.771
Oh?

05:36.814 --> 05:38.555
I thought
you were staying the night.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.036
I wasn't planning on it.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.038
Oh.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.040
Okay.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.434
Now that we're talking
about this, um,

05:47.477 --> 05:51.481
we've never really discussed
the status of our relationship.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.918
Don't you worry.

05:55.006 --> 05:58.009
As far as I'm
concerned, we just...

05:58.053 --> 06:01.056
pick up right where we left off.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.493
That means a lot.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.495
But, um...

06:05.539 --> 06:08.324
I think it's for the best
if we don't.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.109
What?I hope we can

06:11.153 --> 06:12.502
still be friends.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.504
But, um, I don't think

06:14.548 --> 06:17.986
we should be in
a romantic relationship anymore.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.335
Are you crazy?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.424
I mean, poor choice
of words, but...

06:21.468 --> 06:22.469
are you crazy?!

06:26.995 --> 06:28.953
Do you-- I-- Do you
mean you-you really

06:28.997 --> 06:30.868
don't want to see me anymore?

06:30.912 --> 06:33.044
Don't I get a say in that?

06:33.088 --> 06:34.045
Um...

06:34.089 --> 06:35.307
No.

06:35.351 --> 06:38.572
Really? I-I kind
of think I do.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.443
Connie, if I'm single
and have another episode,

06:40.487 --> 06:41.444
it only hurts me.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.794
If we're together,
that hurts you,

06:43.838 --> 06:45.796
and I can't do that again.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.800
I have been waiting
for you this whole time.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.976
Just more proof
that you're a wonderful woman

06:52.020 --> 06:54.370
and you deserve
someone you can count on.

06:55.632 --> 06:58.418
How about Ira
from the furniture store?

06:58.461 --> 06:59.810
He's a catch.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.247
Now you're gonna play matchmaker
for me?

07:02.291 --> 07:05.816
I suppose I am.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.559
You realize
I could call him right now.

07:09.603 --> 07:10.995
I think you should.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.997
You better mean it,
'cause I'll do it.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.651
No time like the present.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.351
I'm doing it.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.486
I'm dialing.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.531
Great.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.319
It's ringing.

07:30.362 --> 07:31.973
Tell him I said hi.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.194
Rosenbloom's Fine Furniture.
Ira speaking.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.762
Hello, Ira.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.373
It's Connie Tucker.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.898
Connie. Oh, my gosh.

07:43.941 --> 07:44.986
How are you?

07:45.029 --> 07:47.118
He wants to know how I am.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.990
Tell him.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.122
I'll call you back.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.691
Can you believe it?It sounds like

07:54.735 --> 07:56.824
he has your best interests
at heart.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.260
Men don't break up with me.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.131
I do the breaking up.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.873
Well, I think it's nice that you
can still experience new things

08:02.917 --> 08:04.527
at your age.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.660
Keep it up, and you
won't get to my age.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.836
So, are you gonna
go out with Ira?

08:08.879 --> 08:10.881
Well, I don't know why not.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.622
Is that really what you want?

08:12.666 --> 08:14.885
Well, I'm sure as hell
not gonna sit home by myself

08:14.929 --> 08:16.583
while I try and figure it out.

08:16.626 --> 08:19.455
Doesn't sound
like you're being nice to Ira.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.849
She's not nice.
Been saying it for years.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.811
SHELDON:
Mom,

08:27.855 --> 08:30.205
will Dr. Sturgis
be coming over again?

08:30.248 --> 08:31.728
Oh. Um...

08:31.772 --> 08:33.382
I don't know.
He should.

08:33.425 --> 08:35.776
We had so much fun talking
about the mental hospital,

08:35.819 --> 08:37.821
we barely got to talk
about science.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.215
Well, I don't know
what his plans are.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.738
Is Meemaw coming
for dinner tonight?

08:41.782 --> 08:43.827
No. She is busy.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.003
With Dr. Sturgis?
Maybe I can join them.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.962
All my fun facts make me
a welcome addition

08:48.005 --> 08:49.441
to any dinner date.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.402
She's not gonna be
with Dr. Sturgis, sweetie.

08:53.445 --> 08:56.187
Then I don't understand
why I can't invite him over.

08:59.234 --> 09:03.586
Your meemaw and
Dr. Sturgis are...

09:03.630 --> 09:06.676
figuring out how their
relationship is gonna work

09:06.720 --> 09:08.243
now that he's back.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.376
Why does their relationship
need to be any different?

09:12.421 --> 09:14.249
It's complicated.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.687
So, we can't have him over?

09:17.731 --> 09:20.690
Sorry. It's just not
a good idea right now.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.127
This isn't fair.

09:23.171 --> 09:26.478
I find the one person in Texas
who understands me

09:26.522 --> 09:28.611
and now I'm not allowed
to see him?

09:28.655 --> 09:30.874
Hello!

09:30.918 --> 09:32.441
Come in.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.443
So, uh, Connie is, uh,

09:34.486 --> 09:36.576
okay with my being here?

09:36.619 --> 09:39.622
Don't worry about it
or, you know, mention it.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.276
Well, here's a pineapple.

09:41.319 --> 09:43.017
It's a symbol
of hospitality

09:43.060 --> 09:45.889
dating back to the 1700s.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.717
Thank you. How...

09:47.761 --> 09:49.589
tropical.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.982
Dr. Sturgis,
hello!

09:52.026 --> 09:53.593
Hi!

09:53.636 --> 09:57.466
Ooh. Did you know the pineapple
is a symbol of hospitality?

09:57.509 --> 09:59.294
As a matter of fact,
I did.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.383
You're welcome!

10:02.427 --> 10:03.603
I got to tell you,

10:03.646 --> 10:06.388
this is an unexpected surprise.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.433
Here's to surprises.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.915
'Cause last I heard,

10:11.959 --> 10:13.308
you and John were
still going out.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.049
Well, now I'm not,
and I'm here with you,

10:15.092 --> 10:17.051
so let's not talk about him.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.706
Ooh. Sounds like this
breakup is a little fresh.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.229
Yeah, it was pretty recent.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.360
What, like, a week? Month?

10:22.404 --> 10:24.580
Literally
as I was calling you.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.366
Well, I'm glad that I was the
first person that came to mind.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.717
Actually, you were his idea.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.370
Still glad.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.549
Really? This again?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.508
Just sit.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.596
Where's Meemaw?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.293
Not here tonight.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.295
Why?As I understand it,

10:44.339 --> 10:46.341
now that Dr. Sturgis is
back from the hospital,

10:46.384 --> 10:47.821
he and Meemaw
are figuring out

10:47.864 --> 10:49.779
how their relationship
is going to work.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.433
What does that mean?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.043
Sounds like she dumped him.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.524
Actually, he's the one...Sheldon, didn't you want

10:55.567 --> 10:57.308
to talk about science stuff?Yes.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.093
Good. Do that right now.STURGIS:
Well,

10:59.136 --> 11:02.096
I realize being here
after ending

11:02.139 --> 11:05.360
my romantic relationship
with Connie is unusual.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.231
So, as before,

11:07.275 --> 11:08.755
I'm perfectly happy

11:08.798 --> 11:12.236
to answer any questions
that you might have.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.324
I have a question.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.587
Can I eat in front of the TV?

11:15.631 --> 11:17.677
Sure.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.548
Let's get back to The Shining.

11:19.591 --> 11:23.465
When them elevator
doors open, oh, man.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.080
All right, let me get this
straight. Your boyfriend

11:30.124 --> 11:31.038
comes home from the
mental hospital,

11:31.081 --> 11:32.213
he dumps you,

11:32.256 --> 11:34.345
and he suggests that
you go out with me?

11:34.389 --> 11:37.218
Yeah.Sounds like a spite date.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.873
Well, gosh, when you say it
like that, doesn't sound great.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.483
No. No, no, I'm fine
with it. I just...

11:41.526 --> 11:42.876
I want to make sure I
got everything right.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.530
Hospital, dumped, spite.

11:45.574 --> 11:46.880
You got it.

11:46.923 --> 11:50.013
All right. I hear the
creamed spinach is terrific.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.320
GEORGE JR.:
How do relationships work
for old people?

11:52.363 --> 11:54.844
When you were young, you didn't
think old women looked hot.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.977
But now that you're
old, do you?

11:57.020 --> 11:59.588
Well, that's
a very interesting question.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.633
Can I speak to you
in the kitchen?

12:01.677 --> 12:03.679
I want to hear the answer.STURGIS:
I've always found

12:03.723 --> 12:07.030
your grandmother
to be very hot stuff.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.379
All right, let's go.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.033
GEORGE JR.:
But you can see
her wrinkles, right?

12:10.077 --> 12:12.906
Why don't you take John
to a bar or something?

12:12.949 --> 12:13.994
Why?

12:14.037 --> 12:15.299
'Cause the children
don't need to hear

12:15.343 --> 12:17.693
about how attractive
he finds their grandmother.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.129
Why don't you take him out?

12:19.173 --> 12:22.089
Fine. You make sure the kids
take baths and get to bed.

12:22.132 --> 12:25.309
Oh, and Sheldon needs
his fingernails trimmed.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.008
Hey, John, what do you say
you and I go grab a beer?

12:28.051 --> 12:30.010
But we haven't cut open
the pineapple yet.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.315
You boys go ahead.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.056
We'll eat the pineapple
another time.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.537
But we haven't had a chance
to talk about science.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.017
Ooh, can Sheldon come?

12:37.060 --> 12:38.540
Can I?No.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.107
Aw.
Aw.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.543
So, enough about me.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.893
What's been going on
in your life?Oh, boy. Well,

12:43.937 --> 12:45.112
after you and I broke up,

12:45.155 --> 12:47.114
I took the opportunity
to work on myself.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.029
Started playing tennis again.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.987
Uh, I-I bought a telescope,
which is pretty cool

12:51.031 --> 12:53.468
because you-you got to see
the Moon all big and things.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.035
And, uh, I-I tried

12:55.078 --> 12:56.906
Vietnamese food for the first
time, which did not go well.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.038
Oh, very spicy.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.561
You wouldn't believe
the heartburn.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.432
Not enough Tums in the world.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.526
This is wonderful.

13:08.570 --> 13:12.356
Did you know
the term "dive bar" originated

13:12.400 --> 13:16.404
because many establishments
were below street level,

13:16.447 --> 13:20.582
and patrons had to essentially
dive down to enter them.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.105
Didn't know that.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.977
Well, now you do.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.326
BARTENDER:
Hey, George.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.718
Who's your friend?Hey, Nate.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.938
This is John Sturgis.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.984
He's a scientist.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.159
Pleased to make

13:32.202 --> 13:33.421
your acquaintance, Nate.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.857
What can I get you?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.642
Um, do you have sarsaparilla?

13:37.686 --> 13:39.688
Two beers. We'll
take two beers.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.909
I must admit, after the breakup,

13:42.952 --> 13:45.694
I was worried, but now that
Dr. Sturgis and Dad are friends,

13:45.737 --> 13:47.087
we'll be seeing
even more of him.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.915
How do we see less of him?

13:48.958 --> 13:50.394
That is not nice.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.266
Sorry, but I'm on Meemaw's side.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.572
She got me
a two-piece bathing suit.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.791
SHELDON:
I didn't realize

13:55.835 --> 13:57.314
we were expected to take sides.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.881
No one needs to take sides.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.665
When Heather M.'s
parents got divorced,

14:00.709 --> 14:02.102
she said it was
like picking sides,

14:02.145 --> 14:03.799
but you get twice the presents.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.061
This isn't a divorce.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.193
And I'm sure Meemaw

14:06.236 --> 14:07.890
and Dr. Sturgis will
still be friends.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.761
Heather M.'s parents
aren't friends.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.546
But now she's got
Barbie's DreamHouse

14:11.589 --> 14:13.591
andthe pink Corvette.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.812
You heard me.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.902
Mmm.
Oh, thank you.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.817
That looks amazing.
I love ice cream.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.297
Did you know

14:23.340 --> 14:25.995
that they used to use
the anal glands of beavers

14:26.039 --> 14:28.041
to make it taste
like vanilla?

14:28.084 --> 14:30.043
No. Where'd you hear that?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.436
I understand it's difficult

14:32.480 --> 14:35.135
to, uh, milk the little sacs.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.617
It's just something
I picked up along the way.

14:39.661 --> 14:40.967
You okay?

14:41.010 --> 14:42.490
Yeah.

14:42.533 --> 14:45.101
Let's eat pie.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.233
And maybe not the ice cream.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.498
Can you believe

14:50.541 --> 14:52.804
Connie was
my first girlfriend?

14:52.848 --> 14:54.458
Really?

14:54.502 --> 14:57.200
And probably my last.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.159
Come on, don't
talk like that.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.943
No, it's true.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.336
She may not realize it,

15:02.379 --> 15:04.947
but this is all for the best.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.689
I'm damaged goods.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.517
No, you're not.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.042
It had just been so long
since I'd had an episode.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.957
I thought I was okay.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.655
But, clearly, I'm not,

15:17.699 --> 15:20.920
and, uh, who knows
if it'll happen again.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.488
And, uh,
I just can't take the risk

15:24.532 --> 15:26.316
of putting Connie
through that.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.536
Hey, she's got problems, too.

15:28.579 --> 15:31.887
I've seen her take a wine cooler
out of the trash and finish it.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.021
I'm not joking.
Well,

15:35.064 --> 15:37.110
thank you for listening.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.938
My pleasure.

15:38.981 --> 15:42.115
And if you want to talk about
your relationship with Mary,

15:42.158 --> 15:44.813
I'm all ears.

15:44.856 --> 15:48.512
Intimacy issues,
communication difficulties,

15:48.556 --> 15:50.210
problems in the bedroom...

15:50.253 --> 15:51.646
Hey! Pool table's open.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.865
Ah! Wonderful!

15:55.955 --> 15:57.521
But if you didget a divorce,

15:57.565 --> 15:59.523
how many American Girl dolls
could I get?

15:59.567 --> 16:01.308
Your father and I aren't
getting a divorce.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.353
But more than one, right?

16:03.397 --> 16:06.661
Are there any questions
that aren't about divorce?

16:06.704 --> 16:08.750
Nope. Sheldon?

16:09.794 --> 16:11.971
Is it difficult
to see your mother

16:12.014 --> 16:13.973
go out with men who
aren't your father?

16:14.016 --> 16:15.670
Wow.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.977
That's a big one.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.935
Um...

16:19.979 --> 16:23.156
I suppose it took
some getting used to,

16:23.199 --> 16:26.376
but she's a grown-up,

16:26.420 --> 16:27.943
and even though
Pop-Pop passed away,

16:27.987 --> 16:29.989
she deserves to be happy.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.034
Just so you know,

16:32.078 --> 16:35.037
I'd be happy
with one American Girl doll.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.517
And we're done.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.909
Thank you so much, Ira.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.347
I really needed this.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.957
You're welcome.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.045
We should do it again.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.873
What's your Friday night
look like?

16:44.916 --> 16:46.483
Oh, no, Friday's no good

16:46.527 --> 16:48.007
'cause we're doing
inventory at the store.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.661
Oh, okay. Well,
how about the weekend?

16:50.705 --> 16:53.360
No, no, no, that's not
good for me, either.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.798
Are you blowing me off?

16:56.841 --> 16:58.756
Is it that obvious?

16:58.800 --> 17:01.063
Well, I don't understand why.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.978
I mean, I-I thought
we had a nice time.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.327
Oh, we did.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.981
But you're still
hung up on John,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.070
and I don't want to have
my heart broken again,

17:08.114 --> 17:11.160
so I'm gonna respectfully pass.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.903
Unbelievable.

17:14.946 --> 17:18.080
I know. It turns out I do
have a shred of dignity.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.039
I'm as surprised as you are.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.217
I'm not having a good week.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.088
Have you played much pool?

17:26.132 --> 17:28.960
Oh, in my undergraduate days,
all the time.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.398
It's just physics
and geometry.

17:31.441 --> 17:32.921
Is that so?

17:32.964 --> 17:34.227
I calculate the angles

17:34.270 --> 17:35.663
in my head.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.230
Sometimes in radians,

17:37.273 --> 17:39.101
sometimes in degrees,

17:39.145 --> 17:41.930
depending on my level of whimsy.

17:41.973 --> 17:44.715
I'm a radians man myself.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.108
That's a joke?

17:46.152 --> 17:47.283
Supposed to be.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.852
Oh, life is funny.

17:50.895 --> 17:53.942
A week ago,
I was in a mental institution,

17:53.985 --> 17:56.727
and now I'm laughing it up

17:56.771 --> 17:58.033
in a dive bar.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.035
Not just any dive bar.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.819
One where everyone knows me.

18:01.863 --> 18:05.432
And they are lucky
that they do.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.262
Excuse me!

18:09.305 --> 18:10.567
Everyone!

18:10.611 --> 18:14.093
Oh, boy.I would like
to propose a toast

18:14.136 --> 18:15.572
to George Cooper.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.183
I don't mind telling you

18:17.226 --> 18:20.621
I'm going through
a bit of a rough patch,

18:20.664 --> 18:22.623
and this man went

18:22.666 --> 18:25.278
out of his way to take me here

18:25.321 --> 18:28.063
and listen to my woes.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.153
And George and I don't even know
each other that well.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.850
You heard it.
Y'all heard it.

18:32.894 --> 18:36.027
But I just broke up
with a woman.

18:36.071 --> 18:39.118
A beautiful,
passionate woman.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.902
Adventurous.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.686
Sensual.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.340
Apparently,

18:44.384 --> 18:48.039
you're never too old
for heartache.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.693
But tonight,

18:49.737 --> 18:51.391
I found solace

18:51.434 --> 18:54.829
in the bosom of male friendship.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.139
To George Cooper.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.230
Drinks are on me!

19:04.273 --> 19:06.275
ALL:
To George Cooper!

19:27.253 --> 19:29.255
What happened?

19:29.298 --> 19:30.821
Oh, I had a few beers.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.823
He had one.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.435
Seriously?

19:35.478 --> 19:37.393
We can't get a dog,
and this guy's still here?
