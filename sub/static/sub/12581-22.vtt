00:29.526 --> 00:34.259
Hey, you think
I'd meet more women

00:34.297 --> 00:36.458
if I changed
my name to Tango?

00:36.500 --> 00:38.934
Don't change your name
again, Bill.

00:38.969 --> 00:40.061
(engine rumbles)

00:47.711 --> 00:49.110
Kohng Koy Kahn!

00:49.379 --> 00:50.403
Mama!

00:54.651 --> 00:57.142
Huh, Kahn has a mother?

00:57.387 --> 01:00.481
Somehow I always pictured
a pod situation.

01:00.524 --> 01:07.396
Minh, you are
very lucky

01:07.430 --> 01:10.058
to have a man like
Kahn to care for you.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.226
You must be
sure always

01:11.268 --> 01:12.735
to show your
appreciation.

01:12.769 --> 01:18.002
Oh, what helpful suggestion.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.601
I do that right away.

01:24.648 --> 01:28.584
Minh, your stew looks nice,
but I would add

01:28.618 --> 01:30.779
just a bit more oyster sauce
for a richer flavor.

01:30.821 --> 01:32.152
If I may.

01:32.756 --> 01:35.224
If I may just
demonstrate.

01:35.725 --> 01:37.693
Hey, Grandma, I just...

01:37.727 --> 01:39.422
Uh-oh. Already?

01:40.263 --> 01:42.197
(grunting):
If I may just
demonstrate...

01:44.201 --> 01:46.135
I hate to leave two
such beautiful women,

01:46.169 --> 01:48.433
but I must go and
bring home the bacon

01:48.471 --> 01:49.597
for you both.

01:50.073 --> 01:52.132
I will miss you, Kohng Koy Kahn.

01:55.912 --> 01:58.005
I will go sit in
the dining room for a while.

01:58.048 --> 02:00.175
Yeah, knock
yourself out.

02:00.217 --> 02:01.650
(spray can hissing)

02:06.690 --> 02:07.782
What are you doing?

02:07.824 --> 02:09.459
Oh, just some cleaning.

02:09.459 --> 02:12.189
No, Laoma, it's
not necessary.

02:12.229 --> 02:15.494
I clean house
yesterday just fine.

02:15.532 --> 02:17.796
If I may just
demonstrate.

02:18.835 --> 02:21.099
(Minh shouting In Laotian)

02:21.137 --> 02:22.104
(clears throat)

02:22.172 --> 02:24.106
Well, hello.
I am Peggy Hill.

02:24.708 --> 02:26.141
Laoma
Souphanousinphone.

02:28.245 --> 02:30.611
Mrs. Hill, I must
respectfully say

02:30.647 --> 02:32.615
that you are missing
an opportunity

02:32.649 --> 02:34.844
for the greatest
cleanliness of
your windows.

02:34.885 --> 02:36.409
I beg your pardon?

02:36.453 --> 02:38.819
You use improper
wiping motion.

02:38.855 --> 02:40.823
If you would allow me
to demonstrate.

02:42.993 --> 02:44.051
I was a homemaker

02:44.094 --> 02:45.220
for 40 years,

02:45.262 --> 02:48.595
and I found that
I truly enjoyed cleaning.

02:48.632 --> 02:49.826
(glass squeaking)

02:49.866 --> 02:52.494
Well, my favorite
part of cleaning
is being done, huh?

02:52.535 --> 02:53.502
(laughing)

02:53.536 --> 02:57.939
Well, I see you don't
relax by laughing.

02:57.974 --> 03:00.499
If you find no joy in housework,

03:00.543 --> 03:03.068
perhaps you would do better
with a housekeeper.

03:03.113 --> 03:05.604
Oh, well, I've had
fantasies about it,
believe me.

03:05.649 --> 03:07.617
We just don't have
that kind of money.

03:07.651 --> 03:08.618
Please, Mrs. Hill,

03:08.652 --> 03:10.085
I would not
charge much.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.553
You know my
daughter-in-law:

03:11.588 --> 03:14.921
I really need to
get out of the house.

03:17.027 --> 03:17.994
Deal.

03:18.028 --> 03:19.052
You can call me
Miss Peggy.

03:19.095 --> 03:22.064
And this, as you can
see, is the kitchen.

03:22.098 --> 03:25.499
There's the sink,
the oven, the floor, the...

03:25.535 --> 03:28.436
Yes. It is like
many kitchens I have seen.

03:28.471 --> 03:29.995
I will find my way.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.632
(humming)

03:31.675 --> 03:35.008
What is she doing?

03:35.045 --> 03:37.741
(whispering):
She's cleaning our house,
for practically nothing.

03:37.781 --> 03:40.614
That wash cloth cost
more than her.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.845
Now get out before
she changes her mind.

03:42.886 --> 03:45.616
♪ Bev-Bev, Beverly Hills Cop, ♪

03:45.655 --> 03:47.646
♪ Bev-Bev, Beverly Hills Cop, ♪

03:47.691 --> 03:49.750
♪ Axel Foley gonna find
those drugs ♪

03:49.793 --> 03:50.760
(laughs)

03:50.794 --> 03:55.527
Mama going to throw garbage
all over Hill lawn.

03:55.565 --> 03:58.295
How I love her.

03:58.335 --> 03:59.302
No...

03:59.336 --> 04:00.360
...not there.

04:00.403 --> 04:03.133
Well, how that spiteful?

04:03.173 --> 04:05.198
What's she...?

04:05.241 --> 04:06.572
PEGGY:
Laoma?

04:06.609 --> 04:10.443
Coming, Miss Peggy!

04:12.682 --> 04:15.048
(screaming)

04:15.485 --> 04:16.850
This crazy...

04:16.886 --> 04:18.113
you survive brutal
dictatorship

04:18.154 --> 04:19.279
in Communist state,

04:19.322 --> 04:21.552
only to become slave
in America?

04:21.591 --> 04:23.320
(groans):
Oh, don't be
silly, Kahn.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.954
Now, does this
"Hank" name tag

04:25.996 --> 04:27.554
look clean
enough to you?

04:27.597 --> 04:32.796
(sighs):
I just don't like
the idea of having a maid.

04:32.836 --> 04:33.894
I don't
even feel right

04:33.937 --> 04:36.030
having a waiter
clear my plate.

04:36.072 --> 04:37.801
So, why don't
you fire her?

04:37.841 --> 04:39.809
Because that would
be even more wrong

04:39.843 --> 04:41.401
than it was
to hire her.

04:41.444 --> 04:43.878
(sighs):
Nope, I'm afraid
we'll have to

04:43.913 --> 04:46.347
keep her on with us now
till she dies.

04:46.383 --> 04:47.748
KAHN:
Well!

04:47.784 --> 04:50.309
That very clever prank
you play, Hank Hill.

04:50.353 --> 04:52.321
You take advantage
of poor, old,

04:52.355 --> 04:54.653
defenseless woman
to spite neighbor.

04:54.691 --> 04:57.091
Wait till your mother come
here on rocking chair

04:57.127 --> 04:59.425
tied to roof of car...
I make her dance
for nickel!

04:59.462 --> 05:00.724
(screaming In Laotian)

05:00.764 --> 05:01.731
(laughter)

05:01.765 --> 05:02.732
Dang ol' Kahn, man!

05:02.766 --> 05:08.727
I've never seen this woman clean
anything, but I enjoy her work.

05:12.308 --> 05:14.606
(television plays)

05:14.644 --> 05:16.908
Hello, Mr. Hill.

05:16.946 --> 05:19.380
Oh, hi, Laoma.

05:19.416 --> 05:21.384
Please continue
to watch your sports game.

05:21.418 --> 05:22.715
I will not disturb you.

05:22.752 --> 05:23.741
Oh, I know, I know.

05:23.787 --> 05:26.483
I'm just stretching
my legs.

05:26.523 --> 05:33.622
(quietly):
Uh-oh. Sticky stain.

05:33.663 --> 05:36.131
(grunting)

05:36.166 --> 05:37.326
No, Mr. Hill.
It is okay.

05:37.367 --> 05:40.734
You stay and watch.
I insist.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.829
(grunting)

05:42.872 --> 05:44.965
Oh, God.

05:45.008 --> 05:46.873
Time for afternoon snack.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.504
You... You brought me a snack?

05:49.546 --> 05:52.174
You are the male child
of the family.

05:52.215 --> 05:56.242
Your responsibility is great,
and so must be your nourishment.

05:56.286 --> 05:58.811
Melted cheese, roast beef,
sauerkraut...

05:58.855 --> 06:01.915
this is a Reuben sandwich!

06:01.958 --> 06:05.519
(choked up):
I wasn't expecting this.

06:05.562 --> 06:06.551
I-I...

06:06.596 --> 06:08.257
(clears throat)

06:08.298 --> 06:11.790
I gotta sit down.

06:11.835 --> 06:14.099
Oh, Minh. My heart is breaking.

06:14.137 --> 06:16.901
With every speck of dirt Mama
clean from hillbilly's toilet,

06:16.940 --> 06:19.067
it one more speck
of dirt on my face.

06:19.109 --> 06:22.306
Your mother must not be treated
like a caged bird.

06:22.345 --> 06:23.903
We must let her fly.

06:23.947 --> 06:28.111
Even if it’s just across the
street for a few hours a day.

06:28.151 --> 06:29.413
Tomorrow
Mama's day off.

06:29.452 --> 06:31.852
I must find her
new way to occupy time.

06:31.888 --> 06:34.049
Something she can do
here in house,

06:34.090 --> 06:36.081
instead of in cracker
shack next door.

06:36.126 --> 06:37.093
Day off?

06:37.127 --> 06:39.425
So she be here tomorrow...
with me?

06:39.462 --> 06:40.429
Howdy, fellows!

06:40.463 --> 06:45.230
I see you are all relaxing
after a hard day of work.

06:45.268 --> 06:46.360
(all agreeing)

06:46.402 --> 06:48.302
Yeah, just having a beer.

06:48.338 --> 06:52.536
I bet you wish you had
super-clean homes to go to

06:52.575 --> 06:54.099
like your buddy Hank.

06:54.144 --> 06:55.236
Uh, well, yeah.

06:55.278 --> 06:56.802
Well, there's
good news.

06:56.846 --> 06:59.110
My mother-in-law has remaining
shifts available

06:59.149 --> 07:00.275
at unbeatable prices.

07:00.316 --> 07:01.806
Who sign up first?

07:01.851 --> 07:03.751
Heck, I'll take a day.

07:03.786 --> 07:06.812
I could use some Asian
fingerprints in there.

07:06.856 --> 07:08.687
Why not you, Bill?

07:08.725 --> 07:10.693
Have you become
emotionally attached

07:10.727 --> 07:12.695
to your many rats
and cockroaches?

07:12.729 --> 07:15.664
No. They can leave any time
they want... I wouldn't care.

07:15.698 --> 07:19.099
So hire Laoma. She
practically free.

07:19.135 --> 07:21.467
Well... maybe I should.

07:21.504 --> 07:24.268
I just always figured I'd have
to be rich to be clean.

07:32.448 --> 07:33.938
This will take me
months.

07:33.983 --> 07:37.043
Thank you, Bill.

07:40.924 --> 07:44.291
KAHN:
Huh?

07:44.694 --> 07:47.424
(screaming)

07:47.463 --> 07:49.431
(car crashing)

07:50.733 --> 07:53.429
BILL:
Oh, Laoma, I can't
thank you enough.

07:53.469 --> 07:56.597
My house is clean,
my clothes are clean...
I'm clean.

07:56.639 --> 08:00.200
And I can't believe
how many forks
you found.

08:00.243 --> 08:01.471
It has been my pleasure.

08:01.511 --> 08:03.274
It is a curious thing.

08:03.313 --> 08:06.544
I moved here only to be closer
to my son.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.982
It has been a lovely surprise

08:08.017 --> 08:10.076
that I have also found
something to do.

08:10.119 --> 08:13.054
Yes... lovely.

08:13.089 --> 08:16.183
Oh, something's
on your mind.

08:16.226 --> 08:19.889
As a barber, I've
seen that look
on my own face

08:19.929 --> 08:22.056
in the mirror
many a time.

08:22.098 --> 08:23.497
Well, there
is still a void

08:23.533 --> 08:27.060
that neither family
nor work can fulfill.

08:27.103 --> 08:29.264
Yeah, there's a void
in my life, too.

08:29.305 --> 08:33.934
It's nice to talk to
someone who has
the same void.

08:33.977 --> 08:34.966
Laoma...

08:35.010 --> 08:40.972
forgive me if I'm
out of line, but...

08:43.419 --> 08:46.217
would you ever consider
spending time with me,

08:46.256 --> 08:48.383
you know, outside
of my house?

08:48.424 --> 08:55.660
LAOMA:
A heart attack took my husband
away from me to the next life.

08:55.698 --> 08:57.029
But I believe he returned

08:57.066 --> 08:58.124
as the gentle wind

08:58.167 --> 09:01.295
that blows through
this meadow, even now.

09:01.337 --> 09:04.738
My God, that's the most
beautiful description

09:04.774 --> 09:08.676
of a haunted meadow
I've ever heard.

09:08.711 --> 09:12.374
My heart... it's been
broken so many times!

09:12.415 --> 09:13.677
I will be gentle.

09:13.716 --> 09:16.651
If I may demonstrate...

09:16.686 --> 09:19.314
Oh, Laoma.

09:19.355 --> 09:21.983
Oh...

09:22.025 --> 09:24.653
(kissing)

09:24.694 --> 09:27.424
Mmm... oh!

09:27.463 --> 09:29.431
So, you guys
go to things...

09:29.465 --> 09:31.433
anybody know
where I can get
two tickets

09:31.467 --> 09:34.630
to "Love Letters"
at the Arlen Little Theater?

09:34.671 --> 09:38.437
Good Lord, has your ass gotten
so fat you need two seats?

09:38.474 --> 09:40.942
No. I have a friend.

09:40.977 --> 09:43.946
You can't take a pigeon
to the theater, Bill.

09:43.980 --> 09:47.313
For your information,
she happens to
be a lady,

09:47.350 --> 09:49.511
and we really
like each other.

09:49.552 --> 09:53.579
I got to tell you, things got
pretty hot and heavy last night.

09:53.623 --> 09:56.524
Ooh, good one,
man, Dang 'ol...
Oh...

09:56.559 --> 09:59.460
Way to go, Bill.
Anyone we know?

09:59.495 --> 10:01.554
Yep. It's Kahn's mom.

10:01.597 --> 10:02.791
(splitting)

10:02.832 --> 10:04.094
By God dang, man!

10:04.133 --> 10:07.034
Bill, she's 20 years
older than you.

10:07.070 --> 10:09.129
She's literally an old maid.

10:09.172 --> 10:11.663
My God, she's perfect for you.

10:11.708 --> 10:12.675
Congratulations, Bill!

10:12.709 --> 10:13.676
Aw, thanks.

10:13.710 --> 10:16.702
So, how does Kahn
feel about all this?

10:16.746 --> 10:19.214
Oh, we haven't told him yet.

10:19.248 --> 10:22.581
It'll probably take him
some getting used to,

10:22.618 --> 10:24.552
and we don’t want
to upset him

10:24.587 --> 10:28.489
until the relationship
is on a surer footing.

10:28.524 --> 10:29.456
Dang ol' 9:00, man.

10:29.492 --> 10:30.789
Dauterive!

10:30.827 --> 10:33.557
My mother get home
two hours late
last night.

10:33.596 --> 10:34.824
You work her
overtime?

10:34.864 --> 10:36.126
(stifling laughter)

10:36.165 --> 10:37.132
I'm sorry, Kahn.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.464
We lost track
of the hour.

10:39.502 --> 10:40.867
Well, that
unacceptable.

10:40.903 --> 10:45.101
Every time my mother
come back from
your house,

10:45.141 --> 10:47.439
she sweaty and
exhausted.

10:47.477 --> 10:48.842
(stifling laughter)

10:48.878 --> 10:51.176
Come on, guys,
cool it.

10:51.214 --> 10:55.878
From now on, you stop
riding her so hard.

10:55.918 --> 10:57.283
(all guffawing)

10:57.320 --> 11:00.585
You need to use bathroom,
Mr. Hill?

11:00.623 --> 11:03.387
Uh, no, no. I just, uh...

11:03.426 --> 11:04.393
It's okay.

11:04.427 --> 11:07.123
I come back when you done.

11:07.163 --> 11:10.599
No, no, really,
I'll just do
it later.

11:10.633 --> 11:13.067
I insist. You go
to the bathroom immediately.

11:13.102 --> 11:15.764
I will wait outside
until you have finished.

11:18.574 --> 11:24.171
(sighs)

11:24.213 --> 11:26.147
Uh, are you still
out there?

11:26.182 --> 11:27.149
Yes.

11:27.183 --> 11:30.050
Do you require
assistance, Mr. Hill?

11:30.086 --> 11:31.053
No!

11:31.087 --> 11:33.146
For three years now,
I've had show turtles,

11:33.189 --> 11:35.157
and I've never once
put them in a show.

11:35.191 --> 11:37.591
I'm a freakin' hypocrite.

11:37.627 --> 11:38.719
Any of you
seen my mother?

11:38.761 --> 11:40.353
Well,
that depends.

11:40.396 --> 11:44.264
How are you at receiving
unspeakably awful news?

11:44.300 --> 11:45.267
Dale!

11:45.301 --> 11:46.893
KAHN:
Oh,

11:46.936 --> 11:49.598
there she is.

11:49.639 --> 11:50.697
Wait a minute.

11:50.740 --> 11:53.300
That not
her housecleaning outfit.

11:53.342 --> 11:55.071
(giggling)

11:55.111 --> 11:56.078
Whee!

11:56.112 --> 11:58.512
Ha. What'd he do that for?

12:01.083 --> 12:06.214
(moaning)

12:06.255 --> 12:08.223
Anybody want to watch the game?

12:11.694 --> 12:12.661
Why, Mama?

12:12.695 --> 12:14.663
Why not instead
become bag lady?

12:14.697 --> 12:16.665
Or actress
in pornographic film?

12:16.699 --> 12:19.896
Why must you humiliate me
in worst way imaginable?

12:19.936 --> 12:23.167
Kahn, I do not mean
to shame you.

12:23.206 --> 12:25.174
I am an old, lonely woman.

12:25.208 --> 12:28.541
Bill such a big, strong man.

12:28.578 --> 12:30.671
When I in his arms,

12:30.713 --> 12:34.615
I feel like delicate
little hummingbird, and he my...

12:34.650 --> 12:36.345
Aah! Too vivid. No.

12:36.385 --> 12:38.080
Don't you love me?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.849
Of course I do.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.151
You're my mama.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.351
Kahn, if you
love me,

12:43.392 --> 12:46.190
you will try
to love Bill.

12:46.229 --> 12:47.423
Oh, we just...

12:47.463 --> 12:49.795
Say it.

12:49.832 --> 12:52.494
I... I...

12:52.535 --> 12:54.264
I will try to...

12:54.303 --> 12:58.797
love...

12:58.841 --> 13:00.308
Bill.

13:00.343 --> 13:04.006
BILL:
Oh, I swear Laoma
and I must have been

13:04.046 --> 13:05.172
the handsomest
couple

13:05.214 --> 13:07.011
in that noodle
house last night.

13:07.049 --> 13:08.516
(weak chuckle)
BILL:
Yeah.

13:08.551 --> 13:11.042
You should've seen the
way people's heads turned

13:11.087 --> 13:12.418
when we walked
in together.

13:12.455 --> 13:13.353
(Kahn mutters)

13:13.389 --> 13:15.357
I guess there's
just something
about a couple

13:15.391 --> 13:18.189
that's deeply,
deeply in love.

13:18.227 --> 13:19.888
(groans)

13:19.929 --> 13:20.987
(forced chuckle):
Yeah.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.327
BILL:
'Course you should
have seen

13:22.365 --> 13:24.196
the way Laoma flirted
with the maïtre d'

13:24.233 --> 13:25.825
to get us a table.

13:25.868 --> 13:26.960
(laughing)

13:27.003 --> 13:28.300
Oh, Bill, stop.

13:28.337 --> 13:29.497
Stop, yeah.

13:29.539 --> 13:31.131
Oh, I thought I was going
to lose her

13:31.173 --> 13:32.640
for a minute there, folks.

13:32.675 --> 13:34.666
Bill, you know
I flirt only with you.

13:34.710 --> 13:35.677
(groans):
Oh!

13:35.711 --> 13:37.508
BILL:
Ah, that one is true.
It's true.

13:37.547 --> 13:38.673
She's like a teenager.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.011
She nearly caused me

13:40.049 --> 13:41.573
to hit the guardrail
driving home.

13:41.617 --> 13:42.515
(groans):
Oh. Oh.

13:42.552 --> 13:45.077
I feeling dizzy
and short of breath.

13:45.121 --> 13:46.611
I think
I'm having a stroke.

13:46.656 --> 13:52.185
No, don’t get up.

13:53.062 --> 13:55.530
And call me a crazy dreamer
if you want,

13:55.565 --> 13:59.126
but are we the only intelligent
life in the universe?

13:59.168 --> 14:00.135
I don't think so.

14:00.169 --> 14:02.069
Mm. Yes, Miss Peggy.

14:02.104 --> 14:04.436
Explain the pyramids.

14:04.473 --> 14:05.440
You can't.

14:05.474 --> 14:06.805
KAHN:
No, no, no!

14:06.842 --> 14:09.003
For love of all things holy.

14:09.045 --> 14:11.570
Now my mother swill beer
in alley

14:11.614 --> 14:12.638
like full-blown redneck.

14:12.682 --> 14:13.649
Relax, Kahn.

14:13.683 --> 14:14.843
She happy out there.

14:14.884 --> 14:17.785
And your mother's happiness is
the only thing

14:17.820 --> 14:19.253
that matters to me.

14:19.288 --> 14:22.189
But what if people
at office find out?

14:22.224 --> 14:23.191
Aah!

14:23.225 --> 14:24.249
Used to be

14:24.293 --> 14:27.319
I could go to
work and brag
about my family.

14:27.363 --> 14:29.797
I tell them,
"My daughter a genius.

14:29.832 --> 14:31.265
"She build perfect replica

14:31.300 --> 14:33.461
"of lunar module for
advanced placement

14:33.502 --> 14:34.469
science class."

14:34.503 --> 14:35.663
They have no retort.

14:35.705 --> 14:38.230
Now anything I say,
they counter with,

14:38.274 --> 14:40.435
"Oh, how's that six-toed
possum baby

14:40.476 --> 14:42.273
your mother have with redneck?"

14:42.311 --> 14:44.074
What do you think, Dad?

14:44.113 --> 14:47.742
Does this look like a convincing
replica of Harrison Schmitt?

14:47.783 --> 14:48.750
Ha.

14:48.784 --> 14:50.411
Astronaut turned senator.

14:50.453 --> 14:53.445
Now this is the kind of man
who should be dating my mother.

14:53.489 --> 14:55.286
Man who conquer Moon,

14:55.324 --> 14:56.985
not man who conquer moon pie.

14:57.026 --> 15:00.484
BILL:
Kahn,

15:00.529 --> 15:01.587
I'm so delighted

15:01.631 --> 15:03.599
that you’ve finally
come to see me.

15:03.633 --> 15:04.600
Yeah. Oh.

15:04.634 --> 15:08.263
Well, I wish I could come here
under happier circumstances.

15:08.304 --> 15:11.034
Well, any problem of yours
is a problem of mine.

15:11.073 --> 15:13.268
Yeah, actually,
this one all yours.

15:13.309 --> 15:14.901
See, here the thing.

15:14.944 --> 15:17.708
My mama has fallen in love
with another man.

15:17.747 --> 15:18.771
(gasps)

15:18.814 --> 15:19.781
An astronaut.

15:19.815 --> 15:20.873
Which one?

15:20.916 --> 15:22.816
Harrison Schmitt.

15:22.852 --> 15:24.080
(sighs)

15:24.120 --> 15:27.283
Listen, can you fly spaceship?

15:27.323 --> 15:28.290
No.

15:28.324 --> 15:29.222
Oh.

15:29.258 --> 15:30.225
Then this could be problem.

15:30.259 --> 15:31.226
But... but...

15:31.260 --> 15:32.659
we're in love.

15:32.695 --> 15:34.788
Oh, come on, Bill.

15:34.830 --> 15:36.991
You know it was only
a matter of time

15:37.033 --> 15:38.000
before she leave you.

15:38.034 --> 15:39.661
Like your wife did.

15:39.702 --> 15:40.669
Yeah.

15:40.703 --> 15:43.331
I suppose you're right.

15:43.372 --> 15:46.239
But why didn’t she
tell me herself?

15:46.275 --> 15:48.607
Because she pity you.

15:48.644 --> 15:51.044
Yeah, Mama way too nice
to hurt you

15:51.080 --> 15:53.640
just so she could find
true happiness.

15:53.683 --> 15:55.708
So I guess
she just live out her days

15:55.751 --> 15:58.743
in miserable, unsatisfying
relationship with you.

15:58.788 --> 16:02.656
The important thing is
that Bill gets what Bill wants.

16:02.692 --> 16:04.660
Well, it really
none of my business.

16:04.694 --> 16:05.854
I show myself out.

16:05.895 --> 16:07.556
Yeah.

16:07.596 --> 16:08.927
Okay.

16:08.964 --> 16:11.125
(sighs)

16:13.035 --> 16:15.560
Bill... are you not well?

16:15.604 --> 16:18.266
I... I'm okay.

16:18.307 --> 16:19.569
No.

16:19.608 --> 16:20.939
Something is wrong.

16:20.976 --> 16:23.342
Usually you're licking
bottom of bowl by now.

16:23.379 --> 16:24.971
(sighs)

16:25.014 --> 16:29.451
You are breaking up with me.

16:29.485 --> 16:32.648
Sometimes you have to move on
to find true happiness.

16:32.688 --> 16:35.885
New people show up
into other people's lives,

16:35.925 --> 16:39.884
sometimes wearing space helmets,
I guess.

16:39.929 --> 16:42.523
This... this is what you want?

16:42.565 --> 16:45.056
Well, I think
in the long run

16:45.101 --> 16:46.466
it's better
for both of us.

16:46.502 --> 16:48.129
Don’t you think?

16:48.170 --> 16:49.137
Oh.

16:49.171 --> 16:50.138
Yes.

16:50.172 --> 16:52.367
Of course.
Good.

16:52.408 --> 16:53.466
Then we're broken up.

16:53.509 --> 16:57.411
There's a full moon
tomorrow night.

16:57.446 --> 17:00.347
Now I guess you
can enjoy it

17:00.382 --> 17:03.010
with someone
who's been there.

17:03.052 --> 17:05.384
(cries)

17:05.421 --> 17:06.944
(crying)

17:06.989 --> 17:10.117
KAHN:
Whata rush!

17:10.159 --> 17:12.650
Maybe next
I break up Hank and Peggy.

17:17.066 --> 17:20.330
(groans):
Oh.

17:20.368 --> 17:23.202
I'm not going to pretend
that I really got you two,

17:23.239 --> 17:24.228
but you seemed happy.

17:24.272 --> 17:25.467
Why did you break up
with her?

17:25.508 --> 17:28.102
Well, she was
clean, I was dirty.

17:28.144 --> 17:29.270
Something had to give.

17:29.311 --> 17:31.279
You'll get a new
woman soon, Bill.

17:31.313 --> 17:34.612
Remember, you scored
with an older chick.

17:34.650 --> 17:37.414
You're the man now.

17:37.453 --> 17:38.420
Oh, no wait.

17:38.454 --> 17:39.284
I was thinking
of high school.

17:39.321 --> 17:40.447
Sorry.

17:41.590 --> 17:43.524
Mama, time to trim my ear hair.

17:43.559 --> 17:45.925
Oh, you doing laundry. Good.

17:45.961 --> 17:48.020
Minh refuses
to iron my socks.

17:48.063 --> 17:49.394
No, Kahn.

17:49.431 --> 17:50.762
I am leaving,

17:50.800 --> 17:52.700
though I will try to
get a few loads done

17:52.735 --> 17:54.965
before I go.

17:55.004 --> 17:56.699
Pinebrook Acres?

17:56.739 --> 17:59.765
It is a combination
retirement home and cemetery.

17:59.809 --> 18:02.209
It's really quite
convenient.

18:02.244 --> 18:04.678
But everything perfect now.

18:04.713 --> 18:06.578
Everybody happy!

18:06.615 --> 18:08.105
I am sorry,

18:08.150 --> 18:10.846
but it is too hard
to have Bill so close.

18:10.886 --> 18:12.820
And the home will be fun.

18:12.855 --> 18:14.345
I am sure there
will be parties

18:14.390 --> 18:16.950
where they make us
wear little paper hats.

18:19.995 --> 18:22.964
Oh! Sill undercooked.

18:25.701 --> 18:27.100
Un-be-freakin'-lievable.

18:27.136 --> 18:28.228
Damn that Laoma.

18:28.270 --> 18:30.500
She just waltzes
into my life,

18:30.539 --> 18:32.598
teases me with labor
at slave wages,

18:32.641 --> 18:34.609
and then runs off
to a nursing home.

18:34.643 --> 18:35.769
No soup?

18:35.811 --> 18:38.245
Where's the fish course?

18:38.280 --> 18:40.077
This isn't right.

18:40.115 --> 18:42.549
I'm the firstborn male.

18:42.585 --> 18:48.717
Look, I should be
in the warm tub right now

18:48.757 --> 18:49.951
contemplating.

18:49.992 --> 18:51.186
(yawns)

18:51.227 --> 18:52.194
Baa!

18:52.228 --> 18:54.196
What the hell are you doing,
Bill?

18:54.230 --> 18:55.197
Ugh! Sorry.

18:55.231 --> 18:56.493
It’s just that this is

18:56.532 --> 18:58.830
where Laoma
and I first made love.

18:58.868 --> 18:59.835
Ugh.

18:59.869 --> 19:01.598
I don't get it, Bill.

19:01.637 --> 19:04.936
You broke up with Laoma,
and now you're pining over her?

19:04.974 --> 19:06.965
I only broke up with her
'cause I found out

19:07.009 --> 19:08.977
she was involved
with an astronaut.

19:09.011 --> 19:09.978
What?
Uh-uh.

19:10.012 --> 19:11.138
Harrison Schmitt.

19:11.180 --> 19:13.148
And I didn’t want
to stand in the way

19:13.182 --> 19:15.150
of her being
with such a great guy.

19:15.184 --> 19:16.446
Look, I don't know about any...

19:16.485 --> 19:17.918
Harrison Schmitt?

19:17.953 --> 19:18.920
Really?

19:18.954 --> 19:19.921
Well, look,

19:19.955 --> 19:22.947
whoever it is,
you just have to go to Laoma...

19:22.992 --> 19:26.052
somewhere far away
from my front stoop...

19:26.095 --> 19:29.064
and make sure you tell her
how you feel about her

19:29.098 --> 19:31.293
and that nobody can
take care of her

19:31.333 --> 19:32.300
better than you can.

19:32.334 --> 19:33.460
Yeah, but Kahn said...

19:33.502 --> 19:36.266
Don't worry about what
Kahn or anybody else says.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.330
You've got to take
your best shot.

19:38.374 --> 19:40.740
And then if she chooses
someone else,

19:40.776 --> 19:42.744
well, at least
you tried.

19:44.546 --> 19:45.843
Look out, Spaceman.

19:45.881 --> 19:50.409
Bill Dauterive
is coming through!

19:53.656 --> 19:54.588
I hate

19:54.623 --> 19:56.591
to see you
so unhappy
because of...

19:56.625 --> 19:57.956
Bill Dauterive.

19:57.993 --> 19:59.221
But, uh...

19:59.261 --> 20:00.819
But who knows
why he does
what he does.

20:00.863 --> 20:05.425
BILL (shouting):
Laoma!

20:05.467 --> 20:08.061
Okay, time's a-wastin'.

20:08.103 --> 20:10.628
Laoma!

20:10.673 --> 20:11.833
Bill?

20:11.874 --> 20:12.863
Laoma, wait.

20:12.908 --> 20:14.535
Don’t go.

20:14.576 --> 20:15.668
I am sorry.

20:15.711 --> 20:17.611
I must.

20:17.646 --> 20:19.204
Where is he taking you?
Houston?

20:19.248 --> 20:20.647
Cape Canaveral?

20:20.683 --> 20:22.844
Okay, Dauterive finally snap.

20:22.885 --> 20:24.546
Come on, we go inside,

20:24.586 --> 20:25.610
call 911.

20:25.654 --> 20:27.315
Look, I don't care
about your rocket boy,

20:27.356 --> 20:28.846
and I don't care what kind

20:28.891 --> 20:30.756
of gifts he makes you.

20:30.793 --> 20:31.760
You want to know

20:31.794 --> 20:33.625
what I think of him?

20:33.662 --> 20:34.856
(grunts)

20:34.897 --> 20:35.829
Hey!

20:35.864 --> 20:37.491
I never stopped
loving you, Laoma.

20:37.533 --> 20:41.731
I just wanted to let you
find happiness

20:41.770 --> 20:43.237
with Astronaut Schmitt.

20:43.272 --> 20:44.466
But I know

20:44.506 --> 20:46.474
you'll only find
true happiness with me.

20:46.508 --> 20:48.408
Oh, Bill.
Oh.

20:48.444 --> 20:49.468
Wait.

20:49.511 --> 20:50.876
Astronaut who?

20:50.913 --> 20:52.608
Yes, Harrison Schmitt.

20:52.648 --> 20:54.582
Kahn told me everything.

20:54.616 --> 20:55.878
Kahn?

20:55.918 --> 20:57.146
Mama,

20:57.186 --> 20:58.619
it not what it look like.

20:58.654 --> 21:00.622
I only did it
because the thought

21:00.656 --> 21:03.921
of you two together make me sick
to the very pit of my stomach.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.257
Oh, come on.

21:06.295 --> 21:08.263
Like you all wouldn't
have done the same thing

21:08.297 --> 21:11.698
if Dauterive was
after your mother?

21:11.734 --> 21:17.263
(groans):
Oh.

21:17.306 --> 21:21.936
You know, this not so bad.

21:21.977 --> 21:25.435
It kind of like those dogs
that so ugly, they almost cute.

21:25.481 --> 21:26.448
Yeah.
