SUMNER'S RETURN

00:15.032 --> 00:19.325
- Oh, hi.
- I know you're surprised to see me.

00:20.951 --> 00:25.869
But it's taken every ounce of courage
to show my face here today.

00:26.078 --> 00:29.746
Come on. We get a lot of funny looking
faces in here.

00:32.706 --> 00:35.290
You don't remember me, do you?

00:35.499 --> 00:41.377
I'm Professor Sumner Sloan. I came
in severaI months ago with Diane.

00:41.585 --> 00:45.711
To my shame, I deserted her here
to go back to my ex-wife.

00:45.878 --> 00:51.130
- What can I get for you?
- I'll have a glass of white wine.

00:51.339 --> 00:57.092
Over dinner last night, a mutuaI friend
told me she works here. Is that correct?

00:57.300 --> 01:00.260
I don't know. I wasn't at the dinner.

01:05.512 --> 01:07.513
You slime.

01:08.471 --> 01:13.474
You are a totaI scuzzball.
You're not fit to live with sewer rats.

01:13.683 --> 01:18.601
- I can't defend myself.
- I thought she was talking to me.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074

02:29.465 --> 02:32.550
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:32.758 --> 02:35.926
I thought you guys
were at the baseball game.

02:36.135 --> 02:40.928
- We left in outrage.
- They asked us to change seats.

02:41.137 --> 02:46.681
- Why'd they ask you to change seats?
- We took off our shirts to get some sun.

02:46.889 --> 02:51.017
They said the glare off Norm
was blinding the batters.

02:51.225 --> 02:53.809
Can I help it if I have alabaster skin?

02:54.018 --> 02:57.561
It's all right. Baseball
should be played at night anyway.

03:00.645 --> 03:02.646
Don't say anything.

03:11.026 --> 03:14.193
Oh. I killed him.

03:15.736 --> 03:18.611
There's only one thing that can save me.

03:21.946 --> 03:26.657
I miss the good old days when
they threw up at the sight of each other.

03:28.908 --> 03:31.492
- Hello, everyone.
- What's happening?

03:31.701 --> 03:35.411
There's someone waiting to see Diane
in the men's room.

03:35.619 --> 03:40.788
Oh, Coach. Sometimes, you get your
participles in the wrong place.

03:40.997 --> 03:43.914
Well, I slept on my stomach last night.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.958
He's right, slats. You do have company.

03:51.251 --> 03:55.295
Diane, please.
He's very sensitive about his face.

03:59.171 --> 04:01.839
You said you'd be right back.

04:02.839 --> 04:07.383
- That was a year ago.
- Well, you know the traffic in Boston.

04:08.383 --> 04:11.051
Diane, I need to talk to you.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.219
You have every right to say no,

04:13.427 --> 04:17.553
but you've always been one to listen
to another person's point of view.

04:20.346 --> 04:23.849
Sam, may Sumner and I use your office
for a few minutes?

04:25.099 --> 04:27.100
Of course.

04:36.645 --> 04:39.564
- Don't worry about it, Sam.
- I'm not worried.

04:39.772 --> 04:43.690
There's no reason to be.
You and Diane have a great thing going.

04:43.899 --> 04:48.151
Besides, any girI choosing him over you
would have to be crazy.

04:48.359 --> 04:50.611
You think he's got her undressed yet?

04:50.818 --> 04:52.819
Joking, joking.

04:53.737 --> 04:58.989
Before you go on, let me say first
that I've gotten over you.

04:59.198 --> 05:02.032
So I hope you didn't come
to get me back.

05:02.240 --> 05:07.117
- I didn't.
- Oh... Good.

05:07.326 --> 05:11.703
I'm still with Barbara, but I want
desperately to win you back as a friend.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.871
I can't live with the thought
of someone hating me.

05:15.079 --> 05:20.248
- I don't hate you, Sumner.
- I can't stand someone thinking I'm a...

05:20.457 --> 05:24.583
A creep? Well, you might
have to live with that one.

05:24.750 --> 05:29.544
My God. Even a trace of your laughter
lights up a room.

05:29.753 --> 05:34.213
Well, there are things about you
that I have missed too.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.088
Sumner, let's cut the crap.

05:37.255 --> 05:42.466
Cut the crap? What have they done
to you in this place?

05:42.674 --> 05:45.009
Do you want to be forgiven?

05:45.218 --> 05:49.427
- You're forgiven.
- Thank you, Diane.

05:49.636 --> 05:51.637
Far more than I deserve.

05:53.387 --> 05:57.765
Now, why don't we both
just go about our lives?

05:57.973 --> 06:02.642
Well, I do have to be running along.
I have a class shortly.

06:05.684 --> 06:08.102
Dare I think this thought?

06:09.227 --> 06:12.812
- What?
- Let's have a dinner together.

06:13.021 --> 06:16.981
The three of us.
I want you to know Barbara.

06:18.315 --> 06:20.775
Oh, I don't wanna know Barbara.

06:20.983 --> 06:25.860
If you want to understand me and what
I did to you, you must know Barbara.

06:26.944 --> 06:28.945
I'd feeI very uncomfortable.

06:29.153 --> 06:32.404
You wouldn't.
You two are sisters of the souI.

06:32.613 --> 06:34.864
You have so much to share.

06:35.864 --> 06:38.824
Please, Diane. Do it for me.

06:39.033 --> 06:42.493
For what was once
and always will be ours.

06:44.243 --> 06:46.369
- All right.
- Splendid.

06:49.954 --> 06:52.455
Oh, are you seeing anyone now?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.874
- No.
- No one you want to bring along?

06:59.083 --> 07:01.376
- No.
- Very well, just the three of us.

07:01.584 --> 07:03.585
I'm looking forward to it.

07:04.543 --> 07:06.753
UntiI then.

07:07.795 --> 07:11.380
Not mad for your decorator,
Sam, old man.

07:15.632 --> 07:18.217
It's OK. It's just a warning shot.

07:19.258 --> 07:23.552
Can you believe he came here thinking
he was gonna apologise for everything?

07:23.760 --> 07:26.345
Want me to punch his lights out for you?

07:26.553 --> 07:31.222
I think the best thing now
is to let it fade from our memories.

07:32.348 --> 07:35.516
You are the only one in the world
for me now.

07:35.724 --> 07:41.227
Oh, Diane, I'm lecturing on Friday night.
Can you make it Saturday?

07:44.812 --> 07:47.104
- Sure.
- Great. See you then.

07:48.105 --> 07:53.565
Now before you get angry,
this can all be explained very easily.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.691
He wants me to meet his wife Barbara.

07:56.900 --> 08:00.485
It's an innocent dinner.
I didn't want you to worry, so I...

08:00.693 --> 08:02.694
I told him a little white lie.

08:02.902 --> 08:06.695
One more thing, Diane.
Since you're not seeing anyone,

08:06.904 --> 08:11.240
I know a young fellow in the philosophy
department you might like.

08:11.448 --> 08:15.158
- No. Thank you.
- As you wish.

08:18.618 --> 08:23.537
This one's a little harder.
Let me explain.

08:23.745 --> 08:27.539
- Sam, will you listen to me?
- I'm tired of listening to you.

08:27.746 --> 08:31.124
You guys are just doing this
to get my hopes up, right?

08:32.499 --> 08:37.918
You don't understand. I didn't tell him
about us because it's not his business.

08:38.085 --> 08:42.711
- How come you lied to me?
- I... I didn't lie to you.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.587
I just didn't mention it.
There's a difference.

08:45.754 --> 08:48.589
It's a subtle difference at best, Diane.

08:54.383 --> 08:58.593
- I should have mentioned it. I'm sorry.
- Well, it's OK.

09:00.386 --> 09:06.222
I'm not an idiot. You didn't tell him about
me because you're ashamed of me.

09:06.430 --> 09:08.806
I'm not ashamed of you.

09:11.808 --> 09:16.518
Sam, you've got to understand. I have
always been intimidated by that man.

09:16.726 --> 09:21.145
He thinks everyone is beneath him.
You make a mistake, he's merciless.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.354
I was trying to protect you.

09:23.563 --> 09:28.648
You're saying I'm too dumb to associate
with your friends. That stinks.

09:28.857 --> 09:33.525
Another thing. You're as much of a snob
as he is, you know that?

09:35.484 --> 09:37.944
You're right.

09:44.697 --> 09:50.658
I'm going to call Sumner right now and
tell him you will be my date Saturday.

09:52.033 --> 09:54.034
You're my fella.

09:56.119 --> 09:58.120
And I'm proud of it, Sam.

10:06.123 --> 10:08.875
Hey, Sammy! All right!

10:12.876 --> 10:14.877
All right. Yeah.

10:16.003 --> 10:19.004
Great, great work, Sammy.

10:19.212 --> 10:24.423
You just argued your way into spending
Saturday night with three Dianes.

10:25.381 --> 10:29.550
She's right. That Sumner guy's
a major brain, Sam.

10:29.758 --> 10:33.802
He's an intellectuaI pit bull, Sammy.
If he senses fear, he'll attack.

10:34.010 --> 10:37.845
Reduce you to blubbering flesh
in front of your sweet pea.

10:38.053 --> 10:41.555
He does seem kind of nasty, doesn't he?

10:41.763 --> 10:43.764
He's mean, Sam.

10:45.140 --> 10:48.516
Yeah, but it's not like I'm stupid, is it?

10:54.686 --> 10:58.730
Oh, my God! What am I doing?
I'm gonna look like an idiot.

10:58.937 --> 11:03.898
It's gonna be OK. Talk about something
you know about and they don't.

11:04.107 --> 11:06.649
Say, something like your apartment.

11:06.858 --> 11:11.193
Coach, I don't think everyone
wants to talk about my apartment.

11:11.401 --> 11:14.737
Of course not. They'd look stupid trying.

11:16.778 --> 11:20.989
No. You know, Diane's right.
I'm gonna embarrass her.

11:21.156 --> 11:24.741
Believe it or not, I think I have
a simple solution to all this.

11:24.949 --> 11:26.908
He's a literature professor, right?

11:27.117 --> 11:30.243
- Yeah, right.
- "War And Peace" is the greatest noveI.

11:30.868 --> 11:33.786
You read it between now and Saturday.

11:33.995 --> 11:37.747
Drop in a few comments over
dinner. You're off to the races.

11:37.954 --> 11:42.498
- "War And Peace" is good?
- The first 800 pages are a bit slow

11:42.707 --> 11:44.833
but it shoots off after that.

11:45.041 --> 11:47.917
I've got five days.
How long is this book?

11:48.126 --> 11:54.712
I've delivered a few for the book clubs
and it's three-and-a-half pounds.

11:55.588 --> 12:00.256
Forget it, Sam. Nobody can read
four ounces a day.

12:00.465 --> 12:04.841
No, listen, if this is the best book
ever written, I'm gonna read it.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.092
I'll get it now. What was the name?

12:08.801 --> 12:12.511
"War And Peace".
You have to write that down?

12:13.636 --> 12:15.637
And misspell it?

12:18.639 --> 12:21.307
The apartment, Sam. The apartment.

12:42.217 --> 12:46.094
- Come in.
- How you doing, Sammy?

12:46.303 --> 12:49.888
Oh, it's you guys.
I thought it was Diane.

12:50.096 --> 12:52.222
Turn on the lights, will ya?

12:54.140 --> 12:59.850
Hey. I've never been in here before.
Classy, Sam.

13:01.726 --> 13:04.102
You know where I can get one of these?

13:04.311 --> 13:06.312
Mother's Day's coming up.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.356
Would you give me a few minutes?
It's almost finished.

13:11.564 --> 13:14.690
- What time is it?
- How many beers have I had?

13:14.899 --> 13:16.900
- Eleven.
- 8:05.

13:18.984 --> 13:21.234
God, they're gonna be here any minute.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.570
Oh, God. Cold coffee.

13:24.778 --> 13:27.946
You know, I've been up five nights.

13:30.030 --> 13:32.365
No, I feeI great. I really do.

13:32.573 --> 13:35.241
What did I stand up for?

13:36.909 --> 13:39.910
- To hike up your shorts?
- No.

13:40.951 --> 13:46.496
- Hey, Sam. Cheesehead's here.
- Thank you, Carla. Where's Diane?

13:46.704 --> 13:51.664
She just went into the ladies room with
a tub of mascara and a putty knife.

13:53.373 --> 13:55.750
- We're out of here, Sammy.
- Bye, Sammy.

13:55.958 --> 14:00.919
Hey, wait a second. Do either one of
you guys have two type B batteries?

14:01.127 --> 14:03.670
You know, I've got one.

14:05.587 --> 14:07.296
No.

14:10.673 --> 14:13.007
- Sumner.
- Ah, Diane.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.176
- Where's Barbara?
- Barbara can't make it. She's ill.

14:18.384 --> 14:23.137
- Well, then, we'll make it another time.
- Nonsense. I won't hear it.

14:23.345 --> 14:27.680
We'll be poorer for her absence
but richer when the cheque comes.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.308
But the whole point
was for me to meet her.

14:33.517 --> 14:38.185
She insisted her frailty not ruin the
evening for us. Isn't she magnificent?

14:38.393 --> 14:40.394
So I've heard.

14:41.603 --> 14:46.147
Sam, if you wanna have fun tonight,
you'd better bring along a yo-yo.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.232
Hey, guys. It's in the bag. I finished it.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.441
Sammy, shoes, shoes, shoes...

14:55.442 --> 14:57.443
- Thank you.
- Here he is.

14:57.652 --> 14:59.653
Sam?

15:00.986 --> 15:02.987
You didn't shave?

15:03.196 --> 15:06.489
No, no. I needed a new place to scratch.

15:08.031 --> 15:12.534
- Hey, where's your old lady?
- Oh, Barbara's ill.

15:12.742 --> 15:16.701
- She won't be able to make it.
- But she'll be with us in spirit.

15:16.910 --> 15:20.537
We have reservations for 8:30
at Maison Robert.

15:20.745 --> 15:24.956
- Oh, wonderfuI.
- I am looking forward to this evening.

15:25.164 --> 15:29.666
I've waited a long time to sit down with
this guy and talk "War And Peace".

15:30.750 --> 15:34.252
- "War And Peace"?
- Oh, yeah. Great book. Classy.

15:34.459 --> 15:39.254
I taught a Tolstoy seminar for six years.
I vowed never to discuss him again.

15:39.462 --> 15:43.130
It is the most over-analysed noveI
ever written.

15:51.676 --> 15:53.677
Thanks.

15:59.512 --> 16:02.722
Smells like something good cooking up
at old Melville's.

16:02.930 --> 16:05.056
Yeah, I wonder what it is, Norm.

16:05.265 --> 16:09.058
Well, that would be
cream of watercress soup, Coach.

16:09.267 --> 16:13.643
Followed by baked mussels lightly
coated with tarragon butter

16:13.851 --> 16:18.354
and topped off by a fine raspberry torte.

16:20.105 --> 16:24.356
Fine gourmet cooking is truly
one of the greatest pleasures of life.

16:24.564 --> 16:26.565
Absolutely.

16:28.316 --> 16:31.442
Coach, what's the expiration date
on these?

16:38.946 --> 16:40.947
Yesterday.

16:42.281 --> 16:44.282
We'd better hurry.

16:56.495 --> 16:59.163
Sam, how about
some after-dinner drinks?

17:01.914 --> 17:05.332
Oh. English. I'm sorry.
What did you say?

17:05.540 --> 17:08.209
- After-dinner drinks?
- Fine. What'll you have?

17:08.417 --> 17:11.544
<i>- A cognac.
- Deux.</i>

17:18.005 --> 17:20.923
- How was dinner, Sammy?
- Hi, Sam.

17:21.131 --> 17:23.132
Great. Great dinner.

17:23.339 --> 17:27.050
The food was French,
the conversation was Greek.

17:27.259 --> 17:31.678
I spent the evening
nodding my head like an idiot.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.886
I see.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.889
Hey, Sammy. How about
I throw the scuzzball out of here?

17:41.098 --> 17:46.183
- No. Diane would be furious.
- I was talking about Diane.

17:46.392 --> 17:49.643
I wouldn't leave them together
for long if I were you.

17:51.769 --> 17:55.438
I haven't seen Diane having
so much fun in a long time.

17:55.646 --> 17:57.647
Thank you, fellows.

17:58.814 --> 18:02.649
The only verifiable proof of the existence
of a supreme being...

18:02.858 --> 18:06.151
- What are we talking about?
- We're talking about God.

18:06.359 --> 18:08.819
The only verifiable proof
of a supreme...

18:09.027 --> 18:11.111
What about God?

18:12.695 --> 18:16.739
- Well, it's rather involved.
- I like involved. Fire away.

18:16.905 --> 18:20.657
Sumner was just saying the early
mystics perceived God

18:20.866 --> 18:24.033
without subjecting him to tangible proof.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.828
- You know what I think about that?
- What, Sam?

18:37.123 --> 18:40.249
- What is your problem?
- I don't... Yeah, I do have a problem.

18:40.458 --> 18:45.626
My problem is I have not been a part
of any conversation tonight.

18:45.835 --> 18:49.712
I've tried severaI times
to include you in conversation.

18:49.920 --> 18:55.173
I don't think "Wrong fork, Sam" and
"Don't spit that out" are conversation.

18:58.048 --> 19:04.301
That's not fair. We tried to solicit
your opinion. None was forthcoming.

19:04.509 --> 19:08.470
Well, you know why that was?
Because I didn't have one.

19:08.678 --> 19:10.679
What do you think of that?

19:10.888 --> 19:14.598
Or maybe I had one
and didn't want to waste it on you.

19:16.515 --> 19:20.391
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.477
I'm saying it.
You and I are a joke, Diane.

19:23.685 --> 19:26.686
You and Sumner too,
but at least you're the same joke.

19:26.895 --> 19:30.146
I may be stupid about a lot of things,
but I know some things.

19:30.354 --> 19:34.356
I know when two people do not belong
together and we do not.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.940
Sam, sit down. You're creating a stir.

19:37.149 --> 19:40.734
Hey, come on. I know
what's been going on all evening.

19:40.942 --> 19:44.194
This stuff about Barbara being sick
is baloney.

19:44.402 --> 19:49.487
You set it up to get your big fan back.
Well, you got her. Way to go, guy.

19:50.696 --> 19:54.740
- Sam, please.
- I see it all very clearly now.

19:54.948 --> 19:59.909
I got you on the rebound. You were just
slumming with me between PhDs.

20:00.117 --> 20:04.911
Well, he's come for you. Go with him.
I'll tell you something else, too.

20:05.119 --> 20:08.954
Before I read "War And Peace" again
in five days to impress a broad,

20:09.163 --> 20:11.748
it's gonna be a cold day in Minsk.

20:25.045 --> 20:30.547
I have to apologise for Sam, for that
totally unfounded accusation.

20:31.756 --> 20:35.007
Well, he's more perceptive
than I gave him credit for.

20:37.967 --> 20:39.968
What are you saying?

20:40.177 --> 20:43.261
I did want to see
if there might be a spark left

20:43.470 --> 20:47.055
of that brilliant fire that streaked across
the sky like a meteor.

20:49.097 --> 20:52.515
Barbara and I had a parting of the ways
severaI weeks ago.

20:54.350 --> 20:57.059
- So Sam was right.
- Forget Sam.

20:57.267 --> 21:01.061
Isn't it obvious after tonight
that we have something speciaI?

21:01.269 --> 21:03.978
Diane, I may not be perfect...

21:04.187 --> 21:06.938
Then again, I may.

21:07.146 --> 21:13.733
The point is, can you honestly say you
belong more in his world than in mine?

21:29.323 --> 21:33.699
Ah. So you've come to say goodbye,
or, as the French say, ta-ta.

21:36.993 --> 21:41.411
No. I've come to tell you
that Sumner has gone.

21:43.371 --> 21:46.789
- He has?
- Carla threw him out.

21:48.539 --> 21:51.374
You chose me over him?

21:51.582 --> 21:54.042
I flipped a coin.

21:54.250 --> 21:57.960
- You let a coin decide this?
- Yeah.

21:58.169 --> 22:01.712
I told Sumner
heads I was going to walk in here to you.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.838
Tails I was going to run in here to you.

22:07.340 --> 22:11.883
Well, you're nuts, you know that?
I mean, the guy is brilliant.

22:12.092 --> 22:16.343
- He's charming, sophisticated.
- Yeah? If you hurry, he's yours.

22:23.222 --> 22:27.681
- Why did you pick me?
- You read "War And Peace".

22:28.765 --> 22:31.809
- So did he.
- You did it for me.

22:33.434 --> 22:35.602
I think it was harder for you.

22:38.019 --> 22:40.020
Call it a hunch.

22:41.813 --> 22:44.272
It was no day at the beach, I'll tell ya.

22:49.900 --> 22:54.402
There's one thing more romantic than
you reading "War And Peace" for me.

22:54.610 --> 22:57.986
- What?
- You reading "War And Peace" to me.

22:58.195 --> 23:00.196
Oh, yeah?

23:00.404 --> 23:04.156
Well, it just so happens
that I have a copy right here.

23:04.364 --> 23:08.282
You sit down right here,
and I'll read to you.

23:09.534 --> 23:11.534
Oh, that's nice.

23:11.742 --> 23:13.743
Here we go.

23:14.786 --> 23:17.245
Let's go see the movie.

23:18.412 --> 23:24.414
There's a movie? Where's Cliff?
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

24:00.889 --> 24:01.848
