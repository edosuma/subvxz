WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:03.604
HUH. I HAVE TO ADMIT--

00:03.604 --> 00:05.236
LAST NIGHT...

00:05.236 --> 00:08.239
WAS PRETTY OKAY.

00:08.239 --> 00:10.611
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.

00:10.611 --> 00:15.086
DURING "IT," YOU WERE VERY VOCAL
ABOUT HOW GOOD "IT" WAS.

00:15.086 --> 00:18.089
(laughs) WELL, YEAH,
'CAUSE IT'S NOT SEXY TO MOAN,

00:18.089 --> 00:21.722
"OOH, THIS IS SO OKAY."

00:21.722 --> 00:23.724
(chuckles)
DUDE, IT'S NOT YOU.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.727
I JUST DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OF MY MAJOR TURN-ONS--

00:26.727 --> 00:29.060
R.E.O. SPEEDWAGON PLAYING,
THE SOUND OF RAIN OUTSIDE

00:29.060 --> 00:31.062
OR THE SMELL OF PINE.

00:31.062 --> 00:33.334
MY FIRST BOYFRIEND HAD
A PINE-SCENTED AIR FRESHENER

00:33.334 --> 00:36.367
IN HIS PICKUP TRUCK.
SO THE BAR HAS BEEN SET
VERY HIGH.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.509
EXACTLY.
LOOK, THIS SHOULDN'T BE WEIRD.

00:38.509 --> 00:41.041
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE DID
WAS TOTALLY NATURAL,

00:41.041 --> 00:44.175
LIKE THE WIND
OR NOT TRUSTING CANADIANS.

00:44.175 --> 00:47.578
I DO HOPE WE MADE A BABY.

00:47.578 --> 00:50.181
(laughs) YOU SHOULD SEE
YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW.

00:50.181 --> 00:53.554
IT'S HYSTERICAL. (laughs)

00:53.554 --> 00:56.827
I CAN'T BELIEVE JEFF AND I ARE
OVER. WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

00:56.827 --> 00:59.660
THERE'S NOT THAT MANY MEN
OUT THERE

00:59.660 --> 01:02.363
LOOKING FOR
A 40-SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD MOM

01:02.363 --> 01:06.097
WHO NEEDS LOTS OF FOREPLAY
AND IS A MEDIOCRE COOK.
THIS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

01:06.097 --> 01:09.069
MMM. M&M TEA.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.841
MMM. (crunching)

01:10.841 --> 01:13.844
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MOPE
AROUND ON THE COUCH ALL DAY,

01:13.844 --> 01:16.147
WEARING A BREAK-UP BLANKET.
I'M JUST CHILLY.

01:16.147 --> 01:17.548
AND?
AND...

01:17.548 --> 01:20.181
GOD GAVE ME ONE LAST CHANCE
TO BE HAPPY, AND I BLEW IT.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.753
I DID NOT REALIZE THAT GOD HAD
TAKEN SUCH A PERSONAL INTEREST

01:22.753 --> 01:24.255
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

01:24.255 --> 01:27.288
I KNOW. IT'S WEIRD.
GOD DIDN'T CARE, JULES.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.160
HE DID.
HE DIDN'T.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.163
HE DID.
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEITHER OF US
CAN WIN THIS FIGHT.

01:32.163 --> 01:35.166
(whispers)
BUT I KNOW I'M RIGHT.
(whispers) SHE'S WRONG.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.567
(knock on door)

01:36.567 --> 01:37.728
(gasps)

01:37.728 --> 01:41.101
WOW. OKAY.
YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE REALLY NAKED.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.674
I SAW WHAT YOU TWO DID
LAST NIGHT.

01:43.674 --> 01:45.236
YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL.

01:45.236 --> 01:47.738
MY GRANDPA GOT BEAT UP
FOR WATCHING LADIES PEE

01:47.738 --> 01:49.740
THROUGH A VENT
AT THE GAS STATION.

01:49.740 --> 01:53.314
SEEMS RELEVANT. DID LOVER BOY
TELL YOU HE LIKES JULES?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.186
WHAT?
WHAT? NO. (chuckles)

01:55.186 --> 01:58.289
I JUST SAID THAT SOMEDAY I COULD
END UP WITH A GIRL LIKE HER.

01:58.289 --> 02:00.551
JULES IS YOUR SOMEDAY GIRL?

02:00.551 --> 02:01.852
MY WHAT NOW?

02:01.852 --> 02:03.554
A SOMEDAY GIRL IS

02:03.554 --> 02:05.556
SOMEONE WHO, SOMEDAY,
SOMEONE ELSE, THE FIRST SOMEONE,

02:05.556 --> 02:07.898
COULD SEE THEMSELVES
ENDING UP WITH SOMEDAY.

02:07.898 --> 02:12.363
IT'S SUPER SERIOUS!
"SOMEDAY GIRL" IS A GREAT TITLE
FOR A NEW SONG.

02:12.363 --> 02:15.135
OH, I HAVE TO GO SEE
IF JULES FEELS THE SAME WAY.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.807
HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

02:16.807 --> 02:20.241
SOMETIMES AFTER A BREAKUP, I
LIKE TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL BETTER

02:20.241 --> 02:23.244
BY THINKING ABOUT GUYS THAT
I COULD SOMEDAY SEE MYSELF WITH.

02:23.244 --> 02:26.177
DO YOU HAVE ANYONE LIKE THAT?
NOPE. NO ONE.

02:26.177 --> 02:29.250
HUH. OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT GRAYSON?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.282
OH, YEAH,
IN ABOUT TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

02:31.282 --> 02:34.425
WHEN I'M DONE CHANGING HIM.

02:34.425 --> 02:36.927
THE TRICK IS TO MAKE HIM
MORE EMOTIONALLY ACCESSIBLE,

02:36.927 --> 02:39.930
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME,
KEEPING HIM A LITTLE INSECURE

02:39.930 --> 02:42.933
SO HE CONTINUES ALL THAT WORK
ON HIS BODY. IT'S A TIGHTROPE.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.765
SO GRAYSON. THAT'S SUPER.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.768
THAT'S A PINECONE. NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOU KEEP FONDLING IT,

02:47.768 --> 02:50.271
IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE YOU
TO CABO.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.443
(laughs) OKAY. I GOTTA GO.

02:52.443 --> 02:54.205
BE WEIRDER.

02:54.205 --> 02:57.208
JEFF HAD A REALLY BAD CASE
OF DIARRHEA ONCE IN CABO.

02:57.208 --> 02:59.850
THAT'S A GOOD STORY.
WHAT AM I DOING?

02:59.850 --> 03:02.783
I MEAN, I HAVE TO BUST
OUT OF THIS FUNK RIGHT NOW.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.185
WELL, LET'S START BY EATING
A CRAPLOAD OF SOMETHING.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.618
PUT ON YOUR ELASTIC PANTS.
ALL RIGHT.

03:07.618 --> 03:10.591
HEY, J-BIRD, IF YOU WANT A FUNK
BUST, COME ON BY THE BOAT,

03:10.591 --> 03:13.894
AND WE'LL POUND BACK A BOX OF
THAT PINK WINE YOU LIKE SO MUCH.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.927
SHE HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
YOU AND ME? WHAT WILL SHE DO?

03:16.927 --> 03:18.929
EASE UP, ELLIE NELLIE,
ALL RIGHT?

03:18.929 --> 03:20.931
I'M DEALING WITH SOMETHING, TOO.

03:20.931 --> 03:23.404
THEY'RE REPAVING THE PARKING LOT
WHERE I KEEP MY BOAT,

03:23.404 --> 03:25.906
SO THEREFORE, I HAVE TO MOVE IT.
IT'S TIMES LIKE THIS

03:25.906 --> 03:28.839
THAT MAKES ME WISH
I OWNED MY OWN PARKING LOT.
REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU WISH FOR?

03:28.839 --> 03:31.912
MOM, I'M GONNA BE LATE TONIGHT.
BE HOME BY MIDNIGHT.
AND DON'T FORGET OUR RULE--

03:31.912 --> 03:33.914
DO NOT WAKE ME UP
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.846
SOLID PARENTING, AS ALWAYS.

03:35.846 --> 03:38.989
I'M A BETTER MOM WITH SLEEP.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

03:38.989 --> 03:40.691
HANGING WITH THE FELLAS--

03:40.691 --> 03:43.954
YOU KNOW, JON, SKEETCH,
TOBY... KEITH.

03:43.954 --> 03:46.226
ALL OF TRAVIS' FRIENDS
SOUND LIKE

03:46.226 --> 03:48.999
THEY'RE
COUNTRY-WESTERN SINGERS.
MAKES SENSE. WE DID NAME HIM
AFTER RANDY TRAVIS.

03:48.999 --> 03:51.932
NO, WE DIDN'T.
WELL, YOU DIDN'T.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.305
NO TOUCHING.

03:54.305 --> 03:57.308
(both) в™Є SOMEDAY GIRL в™Є
в™Є SOMEDAY I'LL MEET HER
IN OUR в™Є

03:57.308 --> 04:00.871
в™Є SOMEDAY WORLD в™Є
OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

04:00.871 --> 04:03.314
WE SHOULD GO UP AT THE END,

04:03.314 --> 04:05.245
в™Є SO SOMEDAY
I'LL MEET HER... в™Є

04:05.245 --> 04:08.319
(high-pitched voice)
в™Є IN OUR SOMEDAY WORLD в™Є
I CAN'T WORK WITH YOU.

04:08.319 --> 04:10.921
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
YOU'RE JULES' SOMEDAY GUY.

04:10.921 --> 04:13.023
SWEET. "SOMEDAY GUY" IS
A PERFECT FOLLOW-UP SINGLE

04:13.023 --> 04:14.555
TO "SOMEDAY GIRL."
(strums chord)

04:14.555 --> 04:16.557
DO YOU KNOW
YOU'RE ACTUALLY THE ONLY MAN

04:16.557 --> 04:19.259
WHO GETS LESS SEXY
WHEN HE PLAYS GUITAR?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
WHY AREN'T YOU
TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.733
I PROMISE TO TAKE IT
SERIOUSLY...

04:22.733 --> 04:24.395
в™Є SOMEDAY в™Є

04:24.395 --> 04:26.266
(laughs)
HEY, ANDY.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.600
HUH?
PLEASE DON'T TELL ELLIE ANYTHING
UNTIL I FIGURE THIS OUT.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.842
LUCKY FOR YOU,
TONIGHT IS SEXY NIGHT,

04:31.842 --> 04:33.844
AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK.

04:33.844 --> 04:38.008
APPARENTLY IT RUINS
THE FANTASY.

04:39.850 --> 04:43.614
WHAT? I DON'T LIKE THE ONIONS.
I JUST LIKE THE FRIED CIRCLES.

04:43.614 --> 04:46.457
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE EATING HERE

04:46.457 --> 04:50.461
AFTER THAT SLAG AT THE SALON
CUT MY BANGS TOO SHORT?
(laughs) YOU ATE
SO MANY FISHERMAN PLATTERS.

04:50.461 --> 04:52.623
YOU MADE IT ON THE WALL.

04:52.623 --> 04:53.794
OH!

04:53.794 --> 04:56.427
SHH. SHH. SHH. SHH. SHH.
HAVE A FRIED CIRCLE.

04:56.427 --> 04:59.670
(cell phone alert chimes)
(mouth full) MMM.
OH, I'VE GOTTA GO.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.772
I FORGOT IT WAS SEXY NIGHT
WITH ANDY.

05:01.772 --> 05:03.804
I HOPE HE DOESN'T MIND
MY FRIED SHRIMP BELLY.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
WHO AM I KIDDING? I DON'T CARE.
MNH-MNH.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.810
LET ME TAKE THAT. SEE YA.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I CAN'T EAT THIS STUFF ALONE.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.643
I MEAN, I'M GOING TO,
BUT THEN WHAT?

05:12.643 --> 05:14.845
HEY, BOBBY.
HEY, HEY.

05:14.845 --> 05:18.018
YOU HAVE ANY OF THAT PINK WINE?
I GOT WHITE WINE.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.020
WELL, MIX IN SOME KOOL-AID
AND MAKE IT PINK.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.993
I'VE STILL GOT
SOME WHITE TRASH IN ME.
WHOO-HOO! YOU BETCHA.

05:22.993 --> 05:24.995
(thunder crashes)
YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS?

05:24.995 --> 05:27.458
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE JULES' SOMEDAY GUY.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.460
I'M STILL
GONNA GET PUNISHED.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.462
IF YOU'RE GONNA
GET IN TROUBLE ANYWAY,

05:31.462 --> 05:34.835
WHY NOT JUST HANG OUT SOME MORE?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.337
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST
THAT THIS SOMEDAY STUFF

05:37.337 --> 05:39.610
IS SO RIDICULOUSLY GIRLIE.

05:39.610 --> 05:42.112
(effeminate voice) "IF NEITHER
ONE OF US IN MARRIED

05:42.112 --> 05:44.445
IN 20 YEARS, WE'LL TOTALLY
MARRY EACH OTHER. YAY!"

05:44.445 --> 05:47.978
(normal voice) RIGHT.
BECAUSE THAT ALWAYS WORKS OUT.

05:47.978 --> 05:49.880
WE DID HAVE FUN.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.982
EH.
AND IT IS RAINING OUT.

05:51.982 --> 05:54.955
PLUS, FOR SOME REASON,
YOU SMELL LIKE PINE.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.858
UGH. IT'S THAT DAMN PINECONE.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.391
HANG ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:00.391 --> 06:03.494
(R.E.O. Speedwagon) в™Є AND I'M
GONNA KEEP ON LOVIN' YOU в™Є

06:03.494 --> 06:06.096
IT'S LIKE
IT'S NOT EVEN UP TO US.

06:06.096 --> 06:08.699
в™Є 'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING
I WANT TO DO в™Є

06:08.699 --> 06:10.701
DRINKING OUT
OF A THIRD-PLACE GOLF TROPHY

06:10.701 --> 06:13.404
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A WINNER.

06:13.404 --> 06:16.807
HA! GOOD THING I DIDN'T GET
FIRST PLACE, OR YOU'D BE BLOTTO.

06:16.807 --> 06:18.048
(laughs)

06:18.048 --> 06:19.049
(laughs)

06:19.049 --> 06:24.114
OH, IT'S NICE
OUT HERE IN THE RAIN.

06:24.114 --> 06:28.459
SO WHAT DID YOU TELL YOUR
PARENTS YOU'RE DOING TONIGHT?
I'M AT A CHURCH LOCK-IN

06:28.459 --> 06:30.461
WITH
THE NATIONAL HONOR SOCIETY.

06:30.461 --> 06:32.563
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

06:32.563 --> 06:33.994
ME, TOO.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.396
в™Є ...LOVING YOU в™Є

06:36.396 --> 06:38.799
в™Є 'CAUSE IT'S
THE ONLY THING... в™Є

06:38.799 --> 06:40.801
MM.
OH, I'M LOVING THE BELLY.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.803
NO TALKING MEANS NO TALKING.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.705
OH, SORRY.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.707
MM.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.709
I KNOW I'M HAVING
A PITY PARTY,

06:48.709 --> 06:52.042
BUT WHEN YOU'RE OUR AGE
AND A RELATIONSHIP DOESN'T WORK,

06:52.042 --> 06:54.044
IT'S JUST EASY
TO CONVINCE YOURSELF

06:54.044 --> 06:57.087
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
MANY MORE CHANCES, YOU KNOW?

06:57.087 --> 06:59.089
в™Є 'CAUSE IT'S
THE ONLY THING... в™Є

06:59.089 --> 07:02.753
HEY, YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE. TRUST ME.

07:02.753 --> 07:05.095
THANK YOU, BOBBY.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.057
в™Є I DON'T WANNA SLEEP в™Є
в™Є DON'T WANNA SLEEP в™Є

07:07.057 --> 07:12.703
в™Є I JUST WANNA
KEEP ON LOVIN' YOU в™Є

07:12.703 --> 07:15.435
в™Є OOH в™Є

07:21.472 --> 07:23.213
в™Єв™Є

07:38.789 --> 07:43.534
(laughs)

07:43.534 --> 07:44.865
OOH.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.637
HOW FUN WAS THAT?

07:46.637 --> 07:47.998
PRETTY DAMN FUN.

07:47.998 --> 07:50.771
HEY, DID YOU NOTICE
I HAD SOME NEW MOVES?

07:50.771 --> 07:53.003
I DID.
SOME WERE A LITTLE SCARY.

07:53.003 --> 07:55.706
I KNOW.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE DOING THEM.

07:55.706 --> 07:59.850
BUT THEY MAKE ME FEEL DANGEROUS,
LIKE A SPY OR A FRENCH PERSON.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.852
(laughs)

08:01.852 --> 08:04.054
HEY, THIS ISN'T REALLY
A BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

08:04.054 --> 08:06.787
COME ON, J-BIRD. THIS WAS
BOUND TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.790
NO BIGGIE.
OH. AT LEAST IT'S NOT
THAT AWKWARD FEELING YOU GET

08:09.790 --> 08:12.523
WHEN YOU WAKE UP NEXT
TO SOMEONE YOUR BARELY KNOW.

08:12.523 --> 08:15.566
THIS IS
THE WORST MORNING EVER!

08:15.566 --> 08:17.568
THIS IS
THE BEST MORNING EVER!

08:17.568 --> 08:19.570
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT
ALL-THE-WAY NAKED

08:19.570 --> 08:21.932
FOR ME LAST NIGHT. I LOVE YOU.
RELAX, MR. McNEEDY.

08:21.932 --> 08:24.935
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S THE FIRST
TIME WE'VE SLEPT TOGETHER.

08:24.935 --> 08:26.937
WHOO!

08:26.937 --> 08:28.278
WHAT'S UP, SKY?

08:28.278 --> 08:30.040
WHAT UP, TREES?

08:30.040 --> 08:33.944
I AM... A MAN!

08:33.944 --> 08:35.515
DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.587
HEY.

08:36.587 --> 08:38.789
HEY, YOU.

08:38.789 --> 08:41.892
OH, MY GOD. I'M SO LATE.
MY MOM'S GONNA KILL ME.

08:41.892 --> 08:45.956
UH, JUST LEAVE THE TENT.
I'LL CALL YOU!

08:45.956 --> 08:49.760
WOW. IT'S MY VERY FIRST
GOLF CART RIDE OF SHAME.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.061
HI, JULIE.

08:51.061 --> 08:53.764
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
JUST PRETEND YOU'RE COMING BACK

08:53.764 --> 08:56.006
FROM SOME, UH, FANCY BALL
OR SOMETHING.

08:56.006 --> 08:57.568
YEAH, I'M CINDERELLA.

08:57.568 --> 09:00.140
I'M GONNA GRAB US
SOME COFFEES.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.143
W-WAIT. DON'T LEAVE ME. N-NO!
OH, I WANT A LATTE!

09:03.143 --> 09:06.717
(laughs) WELL, WELL, WELL.

09:06.717 --> 09:08.148
OH, GOOD. IT'S BARB.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.721
RETURNING TO THE EX-HUSBAND.

09:10.721 --> 09:13.253
KINDA LIKE
AN OLD SECURITY BLANKET--

09:13.253 --> 09:15.826
SURE, IT'S A LITTLE FRAYED
AROUND THE EDGES,

09:15.826 --> 09:19.830
BUT IT'S STILL NICE
TO WRAP AROUND YOUR FACE.
HOW CAN YOU BE THAT FILTHY
THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING?

09:19.830 --> 09:21.832
I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT.

09:21.832 --> 09:25.165
I GUESS I JUST GOT TURNED
AROUND, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AG--

09:25.165 --> 09:27.598
BARB, LOOK. THERE'S
SOME SHIRTLESS FRAT BOYS.
WHERE?

09:27.598 --> 09:28.999
(tires screech)

09:28.999 --> 09:31.872
I'M SO STUPID!
I COULD HAVE CLUNG TO THE EXCUSE

09:31.872 --> 09:34.605
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
JULES FELT. NOW THAT'S GONE.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.607
YOU KNOW,
MY MOM ALWAYS TAUGHT ME

09:36.607 --> 09:39.610
TO JUST JUMP IN AND DO WHATEVER
I WANTED WITHOUT THINKING,

09:39.610 --> 09:43.113
BUT I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
THAT IS REALLY BAD ADVICE.

09:43.113 --> 09:46.116
SO WE HAD SEX AGAIN.
THERE WON'T EVEN BE ANY PROOF

09:46.116 --> 09:48.118
ONCE THE BITE MARK
ON MY KNEE HEALS.

09:48.118 --> 09:50.691
THAT WAS REALLY WEIRD,
BY THE WAY.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.024
THE REASON WHY A WOMAN'S
SOMEDAY PERSON IS SO SACRED--

09:54.024 --> 09:56.066
OH, PLEASE STOP SAYING
"SOMEDAY."

09:56.066 --> 09:58.969
OKAY, WHO CARES
ABOUT 20 YEARS FROM NOW?

09:58.969 --> 10:01.031
DON'T YOU GET IT?
SURE, "SOMEDAY"

10:01.031 --> 10:04.334
COULD BE 20 YEARS FROM NOW,
BUT IT COULD BE TOMORROW.

10:04.334 --> 10:06.807
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY,
GRAYSON.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.809
ANY CHANCE YOU HAD WITH HER
IS GONE

10:08.809 --> 10:11.882
AFTER THE WAY
YOU DEFILED ME LAST NIGHT.
DEFILED YOU?

10:11.882 --> 10:13.984
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING?

10:13.984 --> 10:15.986
THAT--NO.

10:15.986 --> 10:18.218
I'VE BEEN USING THAT WORD WRONG,
LIKE, FOREVER.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.897
(yawns)

10:26.897 --> 10:28.899
MORNING.
MORNING.

10:28.899 --> 10:32.032
WHERE ARE YOU COMING FROM?
GARAGE SALE.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.704
GOT THESE JEANS THERE.

10:33.704 --> 10:35.706
I TRADED MY JEANS
FOR THESE JEANS.

10:35.706 --> 10:38.138
BUT THEY'RE IDENTICAL JEANS,
SO, YOU KNOW, EVEN TRADE.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.671
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT
WITH THE FELLAS?

10:40.671 --> 10:41.812
THOSE GUYS ARE...

10:41.812 --> 10:43.714
(high-pitched voice)
INSANE.

10:43.714 --> 10:45.075
LIKE BAD-INFLUENCE INSANE.

10:45.075 --> 10:47.978
RALPHIE WANTED TO SPEND
THE NIGHT THROWING MANNEQUINS

10:47.978 --> 10:49.980
OFF A BRIDGE, SO I CAME HOME,

10:49.980 --> 10:52.122
SLEPT UP IN MY ROOM,
LIKE ALWAYS.

10:52.122 --> 10:54.354
I'M LYING. ARE YOU LYING?

10:54.354 --> 10:55.986
NO.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.188
ME NEITHER.

10:58.188 --> 11:01.161
YOUR HAIR'S A LITTLE MESSY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.733
(sniffs)

11:02.733 --> 11:05.195
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, BUDDY?
SOMETHING STINKS,

11:05.195 --> 11:08.138
AND I CAN'T FIND IT. I'M WORRIED
IT'S IN MY NOSTRILS.

11:08.138 --> 11:11.171
WOULD YOU SMELL THE INSIDE OF MY
NOSE AND TELL ME IF IT STINKS?
AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE,
HAVE YOU EVER SAID TO YOURSELF,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.974
"HEY, HERE'S A THOUGHT
I SHOULDN'T VERBALIZE"?

11:13.974 --> 11:16.076
HEY, UH,
SO I SLEPT WITH JULES.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.048
(squeak)

11:18.048 --> 11:21.982
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
THE WRONG GUY TO TALK TO--

11:21.982 --> 11:25.085
WHY DOES EVERYBODY THINK
THAT I CARE ABOUT JULES?

11:25.085 --> 11:28.058
I MEAN, I'M FINE.
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT JULES?

11:28.058 --> 11:31.061
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
I'M JUST NOT QUITE SURE
HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER, YOU KNOW?

11:31.061 --> 11:33.724
IT'S A LOT LIKE SOCCER
THAT WAY.

11:33.724 --> 11:37.067
HEY, TRAV.
WHAT'D YOU DO LAST NIGHT?

11:37.067 --> 11:39.299
I WAS OUT WITH THE FELLAS.
TELL ME THEIR NAMES.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.471
WILLY, SEESAW, MARK AND DOUG.
TELL ME AGAIN.

11:41.471 --> 11:44.134
BILL, JOSH, TAD AND CRAZY JOE.

11:44.134 --> 11:47.437
I SAW YOU SNEAKING IN THIS
MORNING. YOU WERE OUT ALL NIGHT.

11:47.437 --> 11:50.240
LOOK,
JUST DON'T TELL MY MOM.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.784
OH, I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOUR MOM,
BECAUSE NOW I OWN YOUR ASS.

11:53.784 --> 11:56.987
HERE. FINISH TAKING STAN
ON HIS WALK.

11:56.987 --> 11:59.790
I'M GONNA GO GRAB A NAP.
(clicks tongue)

11:59.790 --> 12:01.391
(whistles)

12:01.391 --> 12:03.894
HOW COULD YOU SLEEP
WITH BOBBY?

12:03.894 --> 12:06.726
IT WAS JUST SEX WITH AN EX.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.728
OH, MY GOD.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.230
(beeping)

12:10.230 --> 12:12.232
NO, JULES, I DON'T THINK
"SEX WITH THE EX"

12:12.232 --> 12:14.234
WOULD BE A GREAT SONG.
YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE

12:14.234 --> 12:16.236
SOMETHING
AN INSENSITIVE JERK WOULD WRITE,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.809
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT

12:18.809 --> 12:20.811
their audience is truly
thinking or feeling.

12:20.811 --> 12:24.074
NO, IT'S A BAD SONG, JULES.
BAD SONG.
(beep)

12:24.074 --> 12:28.018
THAT WAS ODD. AND HE IS WRONG.
THAT WOULD BE AN AMAZING SONG.
(beep)

12:28.018 --> 12:30.981
HEY, YOU WANT TO JAM OUT
SOME LYRICS?
WHAT IS WITH
THIS STUPID NEIGHBORHOOD

12:30.981 --> 12:32.282
AND THE SONGWRITING?

12:34.184 --> 12:38.188
HEY. SO I DID WHAT I ALWAYS DO
WHEN I HAVE A BIG DILEMMA--

12:38.188 --> 12:40.760
I THOUGHT IT OUT
WHILE I GOT A TATTOO.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.033
A CHINESE CHARACTER.
OH, THAT'S SO CREATIVE.

12:43.033 --> 12:45.165
HOW DID YOU THINK OF THAT?
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

12:45.165 --> 12:47.497
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE SYMBOL
FOR "STRENGTH,"

12:47.497 --> 12:50.240
BUT IT TURNS OUT IT JUST MEANS
"FOOD." THAT'S OKAY, THOUGH.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.303
I LIKE FOOD.
LOOK, I HAVE TO TELL JULES.

12:53.303 --> 12:55.005
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

12:55.005 --> 12:57.207
BUT WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

12:57.207 --> 12:59.910
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO AHEAD AND BLAME ME?

12:59.910 --> 13:02.282
'CAUSE HONESTLY,
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.914
SOUNDS GOOD.

13:03.914 --> 13:07.257
JULES, YOU MOVED ON FROM BOBBY
FOR A REASON.

13:07.257 --> 13:09.119
WHY CAN'T WE JUST CELEBRATE

13:09.119 --> 13:11.461
THE FACT THAT I'M NOT SAD
ANYMORE?

13:11.461 --> 13:13.463
I'M NOT GONNA END UP
BACK WITH BOBBY.

13:13.463 --> 13:15.465
BUT, YOU KNOW,
BEING WITH HIM WAS--WAS NICE,

13:15.465 --> 13:17.167
AND IT WAS COMFORTABLE,

13:17.167 --> 13:20.170
AND HE REMINDS ME OF WHY I DON'T
WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.272
OH, MY GOD. I JUST REALIZED
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE

13:22.272 --> 13:24.274
AN EX-HUSBAND
FOR WHEN THEY BREAK UP.

13:24.274 --> 13:26.136
I'M GONNA WRITE A BOOK,

13:26.136 --> 13:30.080
AND THEY'RE GONNA PUT ME
ON "OPRAH."
OPRAH'S RETIRING
IN, LIKE, A YEAR.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.812
OH, YEAH, AND SHE'S NEVER
GONNA BE ON TELEVISION AGAIN.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.845
WAKE UP, ELLIE.
LET'S GO GET SOME PIZZA.

13:34.845 --> 13:38.388
YOU JUST CAN'T ACT LIKE
THIS IS WRAPPED UP.
IT IS WRAPPED UP.
I WRAPPED IT UP.

13:38.388 --> 13:40.120
JULES.
WRAPPED UP.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.292
HOW DOES BOBBY FEEL
ABOUT IT?

13:42.292 --> 13:44.394
TRUST ME. HOOKING UP MEANT
NOTHING TO EITHER ONE OF US.

13:44.394 --> 13:46.256
AHOY, LANDLUBBERS!

13:46.256 --> 13:48.999
DADDY'S HOME!

13:48.999 --> 13:50.130
BOBBY?

13:50.130 --> 13:51.261
TRAVIS!

13:51.261 --> 13:52.262
DAD.

13:52.262 --> 13:53.964
"ALL WRAPPED UP."

13:53.964 --> 13:55.605
SHUT UP.

14:02.312 --> 14:05.015
OH, YEAH, TOM?
WELL, MAYBE FROM MY HOUSE,

14:05.015 --> 14:07.117
YOUR HOUSE
LOOKS LIKE AN EYESORE!
(man) GET THAT HUNK OF JUNK
OUTTA HERE!

14:07.117 --> 14:08.618
JULES, YOU COMING UP?

14:08.618 --> 14:11.151
I'M THINKING I'LL BE BETTER OFF
NEIGHBORHOOD-WISE,

14:11.151 --> 14:13.623
IF I PRETEND I'M ANGRY
ABOUT THE GIANT YARD BOAT.

14:13.623 --> 14:17.227
YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA BUY
YOUR ACT?
I'M BETTING I CAN BE
PRETTY BELIEVABLE ON THIS ONE.

14:17.227 --> 14:19.259
THEY'RE REPAVING MY LOT,
REMEMBER?

14:19.259 --> 14:22.262
IT'LL ONLY BE FOR ONE NIGHT.
IT'LL BE LIKE OLD TIMES.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.164
WHY IS HE DOING THIS?

14:24.164 --> 14:27.867
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT BOBBY
STILL CARRIES A TORCH FOR YOU.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.100
DEEP DOWN,
I THINK I ALWAYS KNEW.
(door opens)

14:30.100 --> 14:32.102
YOU KNOW,
BUT THE WORST PART IS...
(door closes)

14:32.102 --> 14:33.873
I LIKE IT.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.607
HEY, JULES.
I MEAN, HOW SELFISH OF A PERSON
DO YOU HAVE TO BE

14:37.607 --> 14:39.609
TO HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE

14:39.609 --> 14:42.312
WITHOUT EVEN CONSIDERING
THE CONSEQUENCES?
IT WAS RAINING,

14:42.312 --> 14:45.255
AND R.E.O. SPEEDWAGON
ROCKED SO HARD!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:45.255 --> 14:48.959
WHAT?
JUST DO WHAT I DO AND TREAT IT
LIKE WHITE NOISE.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.420
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

14:50.420 --> 14:53.093
BOBBY'S ALWAYS BEEN A GUY WHO
PROTECTS HIMSELF EMOTIONALLY.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.066
YEAH. WHEN WE GOT MARRIED, HE
WANTED ME TO SAY "I DO" FIRST.

14:56.066 --> 14:58.999
HE ALSO WANTED ME TO RIDE
MY BOUQUET DOWN THE AISLE

14:58.999 --> 15:00.300
LIKE A PONY.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.632
AND YOU DID,
WHICH WAS SO SWEET.

15:02.632 --> 15:04.604
BECAUSE YOU ARE SWEET, JULES.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.277
YOU'RE SWEET AND KIND
AND FORGIVING AND--

15:07.277 --> 15:10.640
WHITE NOISE. THE POINT IS,
BOBBY'S JUST FISHING AROUND

15:10.640 --> 15:12.912
TO SEE IF THERE'S GONNA BE
A CHANCE.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T FALL BACK

15:14.914 --> 15:17.547
INTO ANY OLD HUSBAND-WIFE TYPE
BEHAVIOR, YOU'RE GONNA BE SAFE.

15:17.547 --> 15:20.550
AND ALL THIS BECAUSE I USED
BOBBY AS A SEXUAL GET WELL CARD.

15:20.550 --> 15:24.454
I MEAN, WHO ULTIMATELY
HAS TO PAY THE PRICE?
I FEEL LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

15:24.454 --> 15:27.457
UH, EXCUSE ME.
I BELIEVE I ORDERED SLIDERS,

15:27.457 --> 15:29.459
AND THESE ARE
JUST SMALL HAMBURGERS,

15:29.459 --> 15:33.263
AND MY PALATE DEMANDS SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE ADORABLE.

15:33.263 --> 15:34.564
FINE.

15:34.564 --> 15:36.606
WHY DO YOU KEEP CHECKING
YOUR PHONE?

15:36.606 --> 15:39.609
BECAUSE I'M WAITING ON A TEXT
FROM KYLIE.

15:39.609 --> 15:43.513
LAST NIGHT,
WE, UH, YOU KNOW.

15:43.513 --> 15:45.515
WE SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER.

15:49.079 --> 15:52.082
YOU GONNA TELL YOUR MOM?
WOULD YOU TELL YOUR MOM?

15:52.082 --> 15:55.325
I STILL HAVEN'T.
AND NOW SHE WON'T RETURN
MY TEXTS.

15:55.325 --> 15:58.328
WELL, WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.
THE FIRST TIME'S PRETTY SPECIAL.

15:58.328 --> 16:02.162
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER
AFTERWARDS?
I WAS LATE, SO I RAN OFF.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.263
HMM.

16:05.535 --> 16:07.667
WELCOME
TO THE BROTHERHOOD OF MEN.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.169
(sighs)

16:09.169 --> 16:12.242
WELL,
I COULDN'T TELL JULES.

16:12.242 --> 16:14.244
DO YOU KNOW JULES SLEPT
WITH BOBBY?

16:14.244 --> 16:16.306
'CAUSE SHE WAS
IN A REALLY BAD PLACE,

16:16.306 --> 16:18.308
AND NOW SHE REGRETS IT.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.610
RAISE YOUR HAND
IF YOU CAN RELATE.

16:20.610 --> 16:24.184
WAIT, I ONLY MEANT FOR ME
TO RAISE MY HAND.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.186
YOU'RE
A VERY HURTFUL PERSON.

16:26.186 --> 16:30.360
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO ONE HAS TO
KNOW WHAT WENT ON BETWEEN US.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.362
AGREED. (laughs)

16:32.362 --> 16:37.497
MM. THERE'S ONLY
ONE TINY, BALD PROBLEM.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.199
(smacks lips)

16:39.199 --> 16:41.171
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
BUYING ME DRINKS?

16:41.171 --> 16:44.204
HEY, JULES, WHY ARE YOU
ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE?

16:44.204 --> 16:47.337
HEY, MOM... DAD. OKAY,
I'M GONNA ASK YOU SOMETHING,

16:47.337 --> 16:49.279
BUT NO FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.
DEAL?

16:49.279 --> 16:51.141
BRING IT, JUNIOR.
DEAL.

16:51.141 --> 16:54.314
SAY SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED
WITH SOMEONE,

16:54.314 --> 16:57.587
BUT YOU FORGOT TO SAY
HOW AMAZING IT WAS,

16:57.587 --> 17:00.590
AND NOW SAID SOMEONE
IS PROBABLY REALLY HURT.

17:00.590 --> 17:03.453
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

17:03.453 --> 17:08.027
IS THIS A RIDDLE?
I WOULD TELL THAT SOMEONE
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.760
THAT'S ALL A WOMAN
REALLY WANTS TO HEAR.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.203
WHAT WOMAN?
COULDN'T BE MORE LOST.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.205
THANKS FOR THE INSIGHT,
MOM.

17:15.205 --> 17:17.367
DAD, THANKS FOR THE, UH...
THANKS.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.369
YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:19.369 --> 17:20.670
(men speaking indistinctly)

17:20.670 --> 17:24.274
DON'T YOU GET IT?
OUR SON LOST HIS VIRGINITY.

17:24.274 --> 17:26.045
YEAH?
YES!

17:26.045 --> 17:29.679
WAS IT ME, OR DID HE SEEM
A LITTLE COCKY NOW?

17:29.679 --> 17:33.323
'CAUSE I DO NOT WANT HIM
TO GET COCKY.
AH, HE'LL BE FINE.

17:33.323 --> 17:36.326
DO YOU KNOW
HOW OLD THAT MAKES US?
(laughs) YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS FUNNY?

17:36.326 --> 17:39.559
WHAT?
THAT, UH, MY BIGGEST REGRET
IS THAT I MESSED UP WITH YOU.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.462
JULES, I WOULD KILL
TO HAVE ALL THIS BACK.
HOW IS THAT FUNNY?

17:42.462 --> 17:46.336
WELL, IT'S NOT FUNNY "HA HA."
YOU KNOW, IT'S MORE WHIMSICAL.

17:46.336 --> 17:49.339
UH, BOBBY--
YOU JUST SAID THAT
ALL A WOMAN WANTS TO HEAR

17:49.339 --> 17:51.401
IS HOW A MAN REALLY FEELS.
WELL...

17:51.401 --> 17:54.344
I DID, DIDN'T I?
WELL...

17:54.344 --> 17:56.506
AW, HEY, YOU JUST THINK
ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

17:56.506 --> 17:58.508
I'LL BE ON MY BOAT.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.815
OKAY, EVEN THOUGH I FOUND
THE PILL FROM CHINA

18:05.815 --> 18:08.818
THAT HELPS ME WITH THE HEARTBURN
I GET FROM KEEPING SECRETS...
(sighs)

18:08.818 --> 18:12.362
WHY WOULD I WANT TO KEEP
THIS PARTICULAR ONE FOR YOU TWO?

18:12.362 --> 18:15.325
BECAUSE IF YOU TELL, IT WILL
MESS UP ALL OF OUR FRIENDSHIPS.

18:15.325 --> 18:17.697
(singsongy) GETTING SLEEPY...
WE'LL GIVE YOU
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.670
AND I'M BACK.
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME A SEC.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.373
I WANT
BOBBY'S BAR TAB CLEARED.

18:23.373 --> 18:26.306
THAT'S IT?
NO, AND I WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT I DID IT.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.338
AND, LAURIE, I WANT YOU--

18:28.338 --> 18:31.241
TO NEVER TELL ELLIE THAT
YOU SAW ME COMPLETELY NAKED?

18:31.241 --> 18:34.184
SHE'S RUINING IT.

18:34.184 --> 18:36.816
I HAVE TO GO TALK TO HIM,
DON'T I?
YOU DO.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.549
WILL YOU DO IT FOR ME?
SWEETIE, I WISH I COULD.

18:39.549 --> 18:40.850
(groans)
(beep)

18:40.850 --> 18:43.223
HEY.
HEY.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.725
REMEMBER THIS MORNING
WHEN YOU WERE SO HAPPY

18:45.725 --> 18:47.357
AND I CALLED YOU
MR. McNEEDY?

18:47.357 --> 18:49.559
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.

18:49.559 --> 18:52.202
GOOD. YOU SHOULD.

18:52.202 --> 18:55.205
SORRY ABOUT THE 'TUDE.
GOT A FEW BEERS IN ME.

18:55.205 --> 18:59.239
(man) в™Є I WAKE UP EACH MORNING
WITH A HOLE IN MY HEART в™Є

18:59.239 --> 19:01.511
в™Є THINKIN' ABOUT HER
BEFORE MY DAY STARTS в™Є
SWEETIE.

19:01.511 --> 19:03.913
(sighs)

19:03.913 --> 19:07.677
THE SECOND THAT YOU WALK
INTO THE HOUSE, I RELAX.

19:07.677 --> 19:10.149
EVEN ON DAYS
WHEN I GET SO MAD

19:10.149 --> 19:12.151
THAT I ACTUALLY DO CALL
A LAWYER,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.454
I JUST REMIND MYSELF
HOW SCARY IT WOULD BE

19:14.454 --> 19:16.826
TO BE OUT THERE DRIFTING,

19:16.826 --> 19:19.189
ALONE.

19:19.189 --> 19:21.361
IT'S WEIRD
WITH RELATIONSHIPS.

19:21.361 --> 19:25.395
TWO PEOPLE CAN START OFF
IN THE SAME PLACE...

19:25.395 --> 19:28.167
KYLIE,
YOU'RE SUCH AN AMAZING PERSON.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.201
BOBBY, YOU ARE
SUCH AN AMAZING PERSON.

19:31.201 --> 19:33.203
AND THEN
FOR WHATEVER REASONS,

19:33.203 --> 19:35.205
THEY SPLIT OFF
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.277
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SAY IT
THIS MORNING,

19:37.277 --> 19:40.280
BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT
MY FIRST TIME WAS WITH YOU.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.452
в™Єв™Є

19:42.452 --> 19:44.314
OKAY?

19:44.314 --> 19:45.915
I LOVE YOU.

19:45.915 --> 19:49.389
BOBBY, I LOVE YOU,

19:49.389 --> 19:52.292
BUT NOT IN THAT WAY ANYMORE.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.364
(chuckles)

19:54.364 --> 19:57.627
WOW. YOU'RE NOT PULLING
ANY PUNCHES.

19:57.627 --> 20:01.331
I JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR,
FOR BOTH OF OUR SAKES.

20:01.331 --> 20:04.674
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY, BUT...

20:04.674 --> 20:07.307
WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA END UP
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.240
WE HAVE SO MUCH HISTORY

20:10.240 --> 20:13.843
AND WE ARE...
WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE ATTACHED.

20:13.843 --> 20:17.247
BUT OUR HAPPY ENDING
IS US AS FRIENDS,

20:17.247 --> 20:19.319
RAISING OUR SON TOGETHER.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.392
HEY, YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT
LONGER IF YOU WANT.

20:22.392 --> 20:24.994
I WISH I NEEDED TO.

20:24.994 --> 20:26.996
I GUESS
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY

20:26.996 --> 20:28.998
IS THAT I LOVE YOU,

20:28.998 --> 20:33.232
AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT I'M NOT
OUT THERE, HAVING TO START OVER

20:33.232 --> 20:35.405
AND LOOK FOR WHAT WE HAVE,

20:35.405 --> 20:39.709
'CAUSE IT'S HARD TO FIND
AND EVEN HARDER TO KEEP.

20:39.709 --> 20:43.443
в™Єв™Є

20:46.416 --> 20:49.319
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST
IN AN EMOTIONAL PLACE.

20:49.319 --> 20:51.451
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

20:55.325 --> 20:56.786
WHAT?

20:56.786 --> 20:59.789
HOW DOES THAT LONG, BORING
SPEECH NOT END WITH SEX?

20:59.789 --> 21:01.361
GOOD NIGHT, ANDY.

21:09.599 --> 21:11.601
в™Є SEX WITH YOUR EX,
IT'S REALLY GREAT в™Є

21:11.601 --> 21:14.404
в™Є YEAH, BUT SEX WITH YOUR EX
IS A BIG MISTAKE в™Є

21:14.404 --> 21:16.876
в™Є NO, NO, NO в™Є
в™Є NO, NO, NO в™Є

21:16.876 --> 21:19.379
в™Є SEX WITH YOUR EX в™Є

21:19.379 --> 21:21.381
в™Є SEX WITH YOUR... в™Є
в™Є SEX WITH YOUR... в™Є

21:21.381 --> 21:22.852
в™Є EX в™Є
в™Є EX в™Є

21:22.852 --> 21:25.715
в™Є SEX WITH YOUR EX в™Є
в™Є SEX WITH YOUR EX в™Є

21:25.715 --> 21:28.388
в™Є IT'S THE BEST в™Є
в™Є BUT YOU'LL REGRET в™Є

21:28.388 --> 21:29.689
в™Є SEX WITH YOUR EX в™Є

21:29.689 --> 21:33.763
(falsetto voice) в™Є EX в™Є

21:33.763 --> 21:36.295
(normal voice)
VERY EARTH, WIND & FIRE.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.697
OR NOT.
