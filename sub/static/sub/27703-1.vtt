00:55.272 --> 00:58.580
More than a dozen new
dark spots on the surface of the sun.

00:59.233 --> 01:02.279
NASA's Joint Agency
Satellite Division director,

01:02.323 --> 01:05.413
who has now made the data and
observations available to the media,

01:05.456 --> 01:07.893
has confirmed the severity
of this new data

01:07.937 --> 01:10.070
and what this means.

01:10.113 --> 01:12.637
The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA,

01:12.681 --> 01:15.118
has released new images
of our sun,

01:15.162 --> 01:18.774
and the irregular solar
activity has not only continued

01:18.817 --> 01:20.645
but seems to have intensified.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.170
This means we could be headed
into a dark period.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.910
Governments across the world

01:24.954 --> 01:27.522
now admitting that these
now coined "solar collapses"

01:27.565 --> 01:29.001
that have been recorded
in the past months

01:29.045 --> 01:31.482
are literally
shutting down our sun.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.877
The ecological and social impact
already being felt around the world:

01:34.920 --> 01:36.661
global temperatures
rapidly decreasing

01:36.705 --> 01:38.272
and unrest rapidly increasing.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.056
Many thinking to have...

02:25.884 --> 02:27.843
What scientists
think is really happening

02:27.886 --> 02:31.368
is that most of the solar cycles
have two curves, and not only one.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.544
What they think
is going to happen

02:33.588 --> 02:36.721
is that solar activity will
eventually increase and pick up again.

02:37.548 --> 02:41.509
What we have to fear most as of now is the
unrest that is spreading across the world.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.511
It is important that
we all try to remain calm

02:43.554 --> 02:44.947
and trust that there will be...

02:47.428 --> 02:48.951
I brought these in
from the city.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.606
Thought it would make the
house feel more comfortable.

02:52.911 --> 02:53.695
Gina.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.483
Your mouth.

03:00.484 --> 03:01.442
You're slipping again.

03:23.507 --> 03:24.508
Thank you.

03:25.683 --> 03:26.858
Don't make yourself
too comfortable.

03:27.859 --> 03:28.730
It shouldn't be long.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.130
Shit.

03:45.181 --> 03:45.964
Fuck.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.237
Get in!

04:04.809 --> 04:05.854
Hi, Bean.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.424
Ray? What's gonna happen?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.252
What do you think
is gonna happen?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.690
Dad said everything
will be fine.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.172
That they're coming to get us, and
they're going to take us to the caves.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.958
Where it's safe and warm.

04:28.877 --> 04:29.660
Clara?

04:46.590 --> 04:47.983
Mmm.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.298
It's so long. I like it.

05:00.604 --> 05:01.736
Yours is growing nicely.

05:04.129 --> 05:04.913
Well...

05:06.044 --> 05:06.958
Your room's all ready.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.005
You should clean up
before you see him.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.616
Come. I'll be in in a minute.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.796
Hello.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.146
Yes, hello, this is, uh, Raymond
Beaty calling for Senator--

06:48.190 --> 06:48.843
Hello?

06:49.539 --> 06:50.584
Hello, can you hear me?

06:52.063 --> 06:53.500
Yes, it's Raymond Beaty,
I'm calling for Senator Thorn.

06:54.892 --> 06:55.545
Yeah-- What?

06:56.328 --> 06:57.112
No, I can't hear you.

06:59.593 --> 07:02.204
Yeah. Yes. Yes, you said
that to me yesterday.

07:02.639 --> 07:03.684
But um...

07:04.946 --> 07:06.077
All right, just leave
a message, will you?

07:06.600 --> 07:07.862
Tell him that
we're all ready here.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.256
We-- Yes. We're ready to go.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.651
Yes, it's Raymond Beaty again.

07:14.695 --> 07:15.478
Yes, he--

07:16.653 --> 07:17.306
Hello?

07:29.100 --> 07:30.101
You like?

07:30.798 --> 07:31.625
Bean, I love.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.194
You know, you can't
call me that.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.806
I'm not a kid anymore.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.460
I can see that.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.812
But you know,
I don't think you need it.

07:46.814 --> 07:47.597
You're a natural beauty.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.079
Hey, look at me.

07:57.564 --> 07:58.216
Will we be all right?

08:00.001 --> 08:00.523
I don't know.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.134
Come here.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.267
There you go.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.096
Beautiful.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.235
Ray?

08:22.023 --> 08:22.806
I'm scared.

08:24.721 --> 08:25.896
It's okay.

08:26.636 --> 08:27.202
We all are.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.729
Even Dad? Yeah.

08:34.251 --> 08:35.297
Even Dad.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.624
Did you know that the sun's rays
take eight minutes to reach here?

08:58.973 --> 08:59.626
Earth.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.194
I read that somewhere.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.331
You remind me so much
of your mother sometimes.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.508
Have I told you that before?

09:16.556 --> 09:17.339
I need you, Raymond.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.212
I need you to grow up.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.519
If we're gonna survive this,

09:25.042 --> 09:27.392
your brother and I need you to
be the man I know you can be.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.832
I think we need to think a
little bit more realistically

09:31.875 --> 09:32.963
about what's going
on here, Dad.

09:34.965 --> 09:35.749
About what's happening.

09:36.793 --> 09:37.881
About these caves.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.193
Find your mother.
It's almost dinner time.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.243
Sorry.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.510
I made pot pie for dinner.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.643
You still like pot pie,
don't you?

10:44.818 --> 10:45.688
Um...

10:47.734 --> 10:48.517
Darling?

10:49.126 --> 10:50.171
You needed something?

10:51.563 --> 10:53.261
Yeah, uh, Fred just showed up.
He's here.

10:54.784 --> 10:55.611
He brought someone.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.487
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

11:04.620 --> 11:05.447
Oh.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.233
She's been moving
a lot lately.

11:09.756 --> 11:10.582
Oh, wow, so it's a girl?

11:12.106 --> 11:12.889
Do you have a name?

11:13.455 --> 11:14.064
Claudine.

11:14.978 --> 11:15.675
It was my grandmother's name.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.852
That's pretty. She kicked!

11:19.243 --> 11:20.505
I felt it.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.118
I felt it.

11:25.815 --> 11:26.642
Look at this table.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.471
We certainly have
a lot to celebrate.

11:31.778 --> 11:32.996
It feels good to be back
home again, doesn't it?

11:37.131 --> 11:39.002
You have a beautiful home,
Mr. Beaty.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.656
Oh, well, you should
see it in the fall.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.266
Quail season.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.095
Has it been
in your family for a long time?

11:46.401 --> 11:49.404
No. I built this myself.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.319
You know, when I was young,

11:53.190 --> 11:55.584
the word "inheritance" wasn't a
word that existed in my vocabulary.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.762
It's funny that now
it seems to become ubiquitous

11:59.806 --> 12:01.503
in the vocabulary
of modern youth.

12:04.245 --> 12:09.076
No, my father thought it was better
to rely on dumb luck or faith,

12:09.424 --> 12:10.555
whatever you want to call it.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.601
He gambled away
all the money he earned

12:13.123 --> 12:14.168
selling shoes

12:14.777 --> 12:15.822
to people who were
better than him.

12:17.301 --> 12:19.869
Shoes to people who would walk
more interesting paths

12:19.913 --> 12:21.392
than he ever dreamed of.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.742
Shoes people wore to work.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.049
Work.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.617
That's a word that seems
to have disappeared.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.706
None for me, thank you.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.099
Oh, come on, a little bit
won't hurt the baby.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.187
It's an '86.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.537
No one refuses an '86.

12:36.799 --> 12:37.626
Let's have a toast.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.717
To the Beatys, together again.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.589
And then some.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.114
Cheers.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.164
So, where did you
two lovebirds meet?

12:55.296 --> 12:57.254
Oh.

12:57.298 --> 13:00.344
Um, Margot led this psychology
lecture at the university

13:00.388 --> 13:01.606
that just blew everybody away.

13:02.651 --> 13:03.608
She blew me away.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.699
You should have seen it, there
were so many guys after her,

13:07.743 --> 13:09.397
I practically had
to fight them off.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.399
What?

13:12.269 --> 13:13.227
That's not true.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
It took months
for you to talk to me.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.536
He would just follow me

13:18.580 --> 13:20.190
and then run away whenever
I looked at him.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.672
Let me ask you a question.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.198
What do you intend
to do about this?

13:31.549 --> 13:35.205
When the baby comes, and judging from
your size, that will be relatively soon,

13:35.249 --> 13:38.078
when the baby comes, there will
be no hospitals or doctors.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.296
So, how do you intend
to have it?

13:40.907 --> 13:43.170
And once it's born,
how do you intend to raise it

13:43.213 --> 13:46.521
in a world where only the
strong survive, the weak perish?

13:47.130 --> 13:50.090
Have either of you thought
for one minute...

13:51.656 --> 13:54.050
about the repercussions of
your irresponsible behavior?

13:59.577 --> 14:00.709
It's really good to be home.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.741
When are they coming
for us, Fred?

14:45.319 --> 14:48.975
I'm gonna prove to you
that I can take care of you.

14:53.109 --> 14:53.893
I love you.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.165
Awake? Hmm.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.000
Up and at 'em, okay?

16:41.696 --> 16:42.697
Breakfast.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.746
We're gonna be okay.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.364
Your hair looks pretty.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.583
Okay.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.718
Is it gonna start
getting cold?

17:04.893 --> 17:05.849
We have plenty of heat.

17:06.721 --> 17:07.678
We have plenty of warmth.

17:08.983 --> 17:09.767
Okay?

17:30.788 --> 17:31.659
I'm sorry.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.097
Breakfast is ready.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.197
Thank you.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.332
Is he going to stay up there
all day again?

17:55.117 --> 17:56.684
I'll go check on him.Ah.

17:56.727 --> 17:57.772
How good of you to join us.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.737
What? You guys don't
know what today is?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.305
What day is it?

18:09.349 --> 18:12.091
Well, my dear sister, today
is the first day of spring.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.529
The flowers have bloomed,
the birds are singing,

18:15.572 --> 18:16.356
and the sun is shining.

18:18.575 --> 18:19.359
He's barking again.

18:20.534 --> 18:21.578
Maybe he needs help.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.712
You've gotta eat something.

18:25.756 --> 18:26.888
You're gonna hurt
the baby if you don't.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.371
Darling, please eat something.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.982
Fred, I found that old axe
in the basement.

18:34.025 --> 18:37.246
Maybe you and I could go and
chop some wood after breakfast.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.422
Yeah, that's fine--I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.816
When are they coming for us?

18:44.819 --> 18:45.994
Please, for God's sake!

18:47.517 --> 18:49.040
Dad, I'm sorry--No, no. Fred, it's okay.
It's all right.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.086
She's just worried
about her survival.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.436
To be honest, I'd be
concerned if she weren't.

18:55.569 --> 18:56.961
Do you pray at night, Margot?

18:59.312 --> 19:01.052
I've never been
a man of faith myself.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.142
I'm a practical man.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.494
I think life is simple. If you live a
life of integrity and responsibility,

19:07.537 --> 19:08.321
then you're rewarded.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.410
My conscious is clear.

19:11.454 --> 19:12.803
You can't do this anymore?

19:14.457 --> 19:15.763
Well, there's the door.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.331
And nobody's going to stop you
and I'm sure God will go with you.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.812
They'll come for us
when they come for us,

19:21.856 --> 19:24.902
and my family will wait
as long as we have to.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.864
You're lying. Margot, please...

19:30.169 --> 19:31.561
Who do you think you are?

19:33.302 --> 19:34.912
- Just because you found your
golden ticket, -What are you--

19:34.956 --> 19:36.914
you think you can come into
my house and call me a liar?

19:37.872 --> 19:40.788
You sit here,
eat my food in my house.

19:40.831 --> 19:41.832
Who do you think you are?

19:52.365 --> 19:53.844
Clara, for God's sake, stop
fidgeting!

20:03.811 --> 20:04.855
Gina.

20:19.392 --> 20:20.654
Too freakin' sunny in here.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.007
I can't be
here one more second.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.009
We're safe here.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.577
It's freezing outside--

20:30.620 --> 20:31.926
I want to go home!

20:31.969 --> 20:33.797
I want to call my family!

20:34.276 --> 20:36.235
I want to use the house phone!

20:36.713 --> 20:38.367
We're waiting for someone
to come get us. When?

20:39.325 --> 20:41.675
You promised me we'd be safe.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.764
There's just other people
they have to pick up first.

20:43.807 --> 20:44.982
We have to wait.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.637
We are just waiting for death.

20:53.861 --> 20:54.905
Hey.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.300
Hey, we are not
just waiting for death, okay?

21:00.171 --> 21:01.172
We're waiting for her.

21:03.827 --> 21:06.003
When she comes,
everything will be better.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.012
She's safe.

21:55.836 --> 21:56.402
There!

21:57.054 --> 21:58.404
Okay.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.014
Let's see. Go look.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.240
You know, you're pretty
good at this.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.460
Abbey used to do it to me.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.593
She wore it all the time.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.291
I think that's why boys
liked her so much.

22:16.683 --> 22:17.423
Who's Abbey?

22:17.901 --> 22:18.946
You can't go in there.

22:19.990 --> 22:20.774
Why not?

22:23.733 --> 22:24.517
We're not supposed to.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.260
I'll be right in.Okay.

23:26.927 --> 23:27.971
Clara did it.

23:28.885 --> 23:29.669
Isn't it nice?

23:44.335 --> 23:45.249
Fred. Hmm?

23:47.469 --> 23:48.252
Who's Abbey?

23:52.648 --> 23:53.432
She was my sister.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.217
She died five years ago.

23:57.653 --> 23:58.524
I'm so sorry.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.308
Why didn't you tell me?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.223
Let's not talk about this, okay?

24:10.623 --> 24:13.103
Can we spend all day
together tomorrow?

24:13.974 --> 24:14.931
What's tomorrow?

24:18.282 --> 24:19.066
Mom.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.068
Hey, Mom.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.462
Yes?

24:23.853 --> 24:25.464
Can I dress up
for my birthday?

24:26.116 --> 24:26.943
Yes.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.106
How are you? I'm fine.

25:00.063 --> 25:00.890
Darling.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.515
I know we don't really
get to talk about Abbey.

25:20.257 --> 25:22.477
I'm sorry I couldn't be here.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.742
That was a really horrible day.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.354
Please. I'm fine.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.750
You've got to stop saying
that you're fine.

25:35.272 --> 25:36.839
Not when it sounds
like you're not.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.014
I don't want to talk about it.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.451
It's okay to talk about it.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.714
No, it's not okay
to talk about it.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.454
Yes, it is.
It's okay to talk about it.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.544
Haven't we all
been through enough?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.502
Why do you insist
on talking about it?

25:47.894 --> 25:50.026
Clara! Get off of that piano!

25:51.071 --> 25:52.507
Why? Because I said so!

26:00.341 --> 26:01.385
I'm fine.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.170
I'm fine.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.769
Mom?

26:38.858 --> 26:39.946
Are you mad at me?

26:43.950 --> 26:44.994
No.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.260
How could I be mad
at my little baby?

26:51.871 --> 26:53.263
Oh.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.525
My darling little bunny.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.746
Oh, I've missed you.

27:03.186 --> 27:04.448
You mustn't go running off now.

27:05.362 --> 27:06.363
Mommy gets worried.

27:09.236 --> 27:11.151
Oh, you grew up so fast.

27:13.762 --> 27:14.589
Mom?

27:15.503 --> 27:16.373
You're hurting me.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.258
I'm tired.

27:33.477 --> 27:34.261
It's time for bed.

27:37.917 --> 27:38.961
Let me rest, Clara.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.582
Look, I don't know
what the hold-up is here, but...

27:53.193 --> 27:56.631
I am running pretty low on patience so
if you could just give me a time frame.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.416
I've got a house
full of people here and...

28:00.504 --> 28:01.462
and...

28:03.203 --> 28:04.944
I practically got you your fucking
nomination, you son of a bitch!

28:04.987 --> 28:06.075
You owe me, Bill.

28:06.119 --> 28:06.902
You promised me!

28:10.340 --> 28:11.167
Bill, I'm sorry.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.257
I'm sorry, um...

28:15.476 --> 28:16.346
Just--

28:16.390 --> 28:17.478
Just give me a call, okay?

28:17.521 --> 28:21.134
Or just answer your phone.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.484
Will you do that, old friend?

28:24.659 --> 28:25.442
Okay?

28:27.488 --> 28:28.532
Okay.

28:43.983 --> 28:44.766
Hey.

28:47.595 --> 28:48.770
Is it time?

28:48.814 --> 28:50.990
No, no, no. It's tomorrow.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.038
Happy birthday.

29:08.572 --> 29:09.356
Good job.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.624
You want to go see
something cool?

29:19.235 --> 29:20.933
Hmm? Hmm?

29:22.151 --> 29:23.152
Come on, let's go.

29:26.634 --> 29:27.374
We're gonna
get in trouble.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.117
Dad doesn't like
when we go outside at nighttime.

29:32.118 --> 29:33.119
It's always nighttime.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.474
What is it?

29:40.866 --> 29:41.649
I don't know.

29:45.566 --> 29:46.959
This is cool.Yeah.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.178
Happy birthday, Clara.

29:52.268 --> 29:53.313
Ray.

29:54.575 --> 29:55.750
Promise you won't leave.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.622
Clara... Just...

29:59.885 --> 30:00.711
Promise?

30:03.323 --> 30:04.498
I promise.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.067
Come on.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.525
Perfect.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.353
What do you think?

30:34.267 --> 30:35.790
Best cake ever.

30:38.445 --> 30:39.838
- Mom.
- What?

30:40.708 --> 30:42.318
You're not too old
for that, are you?

30:42.753 --> 30:43.406
Never too old for that.Yep.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.022
Good.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.110
I can't do it.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.765
There should be some candles
in the drawers over there.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.207
Mom? Hmm? Yeah.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.080
You should go get dressed.

31:22.228 --> 31:23.185
Where's the birthday girl?

31:24.230 --> 31:25.405
Clara, we're waiting!

31:26.667 --> 31:28.321
Oh, that dog.

31:32.020 --> 31:32.847
Clara?

31:41.116 --> 31:41.987
You think this is funny?

31:44.946 --> 31:46.687
Mom said that I could dress up.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.125
What is it with you?

31:55.174 --> 31:56.653
I'm sorry--Off. Now.

33:43.499 --> 33:44.631
It still looks good.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.112
Thanks.
It's time to cut the cake.

33:50.593 --> 33:51.638
Is he dead?

33:53.509 --> 33:54.858
- What?
- The dog.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.035
You didn't kill him, did you?

33:58.775 --> 33:59.820
No, no, no.

34:00.603 --> 34:01.648
Where's that cake?

34:04.520 --> 34:05.782
My little girl's birthday.

34:07.132 --> 34:07.958
We can't yet.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.004
We're waiting for Ray.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.049
Oh, never mind him.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.443
Do you want to tell me what you
two were doing outside last night?

34:18.578 --> 34:19.143
Don't fidget.

34:20.536 --> 34:21.797
Don't bother lying to me.

34:23.190 --> 34:24.235
Why were you outside?

34:29.893 --> 34:32.373
Clara, I thought I made
myself perfectly clear.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.159
I don't want you going
outside at nighttime.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.077
- It's always nighttime. -I don't
want you going outside, period.

34:39.425 --> 34:42.080
Not at night, not during
the day, not any time.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.777
Do you understand
why I'm telling you this?

34:47.520 --> 34:48.563
Do you really?

34:53.091 --> 34:56.094
Because here we have warmth.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.312
We have food.

34:57.747 --> 34:58.661
We're safe.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.881
I am trying to take care of you.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.754
All of you! Why do you make it
so goddamn hard?

35:06.713 --> 35:07.757
Don't cry.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.368
Look at me, Clara.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.760
Look at me. Don't cry.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.458
Do not cry.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.764
Do you understand?

35:17.202 --> 35:19.769
You understand why it's not safe
to go outside?

35:23.860 --> 35:26.385
♪ Happy birthday to you

35:27.516 --> 35:30.476
♪ Happy birthday to you

35:31.390 --> 35:34.915
♪ Happy birthday, dear Clara

35:35.655 --> 35:38.745
♪ Happy birthday to you

35:40.138 --> 35:40.790
Make a wish, Clara.

38:10.026 --> 38:10.984
I'm sorry.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.856
Sorry I haven't
been there for you.

38:16.859 --> 38:17.991
You're going to be a dad.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.038
You have a girl that loves you.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.086
And you're happy.

38:26.608 --> 38:27.653
Aren't you?

38:33.702 --> 38:35.095
You know, I keep having
this dream,

38:36.314 --> 38:37.706
over and over again,
the same one.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.537
I'm holding her in my arms.
Claudine.

38:42.581 --> 38:43.625
Hmm.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.063
She's the size
of a bread crumb.

38:48.674 --> 38:49.457
So small.

38:51.894 --> 38:54.027
And I'm just so scared
I'm going to drop her.

38:55.637 --> 38:56.682
And I do.

38:57.422 --> 38:58.248
I drop her.

39:01.904 --> 39:03.036
It's only a dream, Fred.

39:07.693 --> 39:08.781
We shouldn't be outside.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.114
Sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

39:38.158 --> 39:39.289
Uh, you didn't. It's just...

39:39.942 --> 39:41.509
It's usually just me
up at this time.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.207
I couldn't sleep.

39:44.251 --> 39:45.295
I'm sorry.

39:45.557 --> 39:46.384
No, no, no. It's fine.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.038
What are you reading?

39:58.787 --> 39:59.571
I thought...

40:01.529 --> 40:03.575
just in case
I never get to meet her,

40:06.012 --> 40:08.057
at least I would know
what it would be like...

40:09.668 --> 40:10.451
to have her.

40:13.672 --> 40:14.586
It's silly.

40:18.894 --> 40:19.939
Why did you leave?

40:23.116 --> 40:25.248
I just couldn't deal anymore, you know?
I couldn't...

40:28.817 --> 40:29.949
With everything that happened.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.691
I heard about your sister.

40:35.694 --> 40:36.477
I'm sorry.

40:39.741 --> 40:41.308
Yeah, well,
that was a long time ago.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.833
Yeah. It's late.
I'm gonna actually...

40:46.052 --> 40:47.270
try and get some sleep.

40:49.577 --> 40:50.622
What happened to her?

40:55.975 --> 40:57.237
Our father killed her.

41:24.830 --> 41:25.874
I love you, too.

41:28.398 --> 41:29.487
I miss you so much.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.577
Every night I go outside

41:32.620 --> 41:35.231
and I look up at the stars
like we used to.

41:38.017 --> 41:39.366
I don't know if I can do this.

41:42.848 --> 41:46.112
It's... This is way
worse than I remember.

41:50.899 --> 41:51.900
I can't.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.293
No, I can't.

41:55.904 --> 41:57.384
They're still my family.

41:57.645 --> 41:59.255
I need to be here for Clara.
She needs me.

42:00.605 --> 42:01.606
I can't leave her again.

42:05.348 --> 42:07.655
This is not to be used...
by anyone.

42:08.874 --> 42:09.918
Understood?

42:13.313 --> 42:15.228
At least you had the good sense
not to bring her here with you.

42:15.794 --> 42:18.187
Well, nobody deserves
to spend their last days here.

42:52.395 --> 42:54.310
You, my dear,
are nothing!

42:54.746 --> 42:55.834
You're nothing!

42:55.877 --> 42:57.096
You do not exist!

42:57.139 --> 42:59.577
Do you understand me?
You don't exist!

43:32.958 --> 43:34.002
She's here.

43:40.618 --> 43:41.357
Come on now, Gina.

43:42.532 --> 43:43.664
You better get
a start on dinner.

43:45.318 --> 43:46.493
She's always been here.

43:46.885 --> 43:48.451
No. She hasn't.

43:49.670 --> 43:50.932
Abbey is dead. You know that.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.325
No.

43:53.718 --> 43:54.762
No.

43:57.809 --> 43:59.158
Don't fall apart on me now.

44:01.247 --> 44:02.291
We're almost there.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.426
Why didn't we help her?

44:09.037 --> 44:11.649
Why didn't we understand?
She was just a child.

44:21.920 --> 44:22.703
You don't even care.

44:24.270 --> 44:25.793
You think I don't miss her?

44:25.837 --> 44:27.752
You think I don't think
about her every single day?

44:27.795 --> 44:29.841
Then why didn't you
let me go after her?

44:29.884 --> 44:31.103
Why did you stop me?

44:35.455 --> 44:36.499
Take your medicine. I don't want it.

44:36.543 --> 44:38.545
- Take your medicine!
- No! No!

44:38.588 --> 44:39.677
Gina, take your medicine!

44:39.720 --> 44:40.678
It's all your fault!

44:40.895 --> 44:42.462
It's all your fault!

44:43.115 --> 44:44.638
No, it's your fault!

44:44.682 --> 44:45.726
It's your fault!

44:45.770 --> 44:47.032
You couldn't take care of her.

44:47.075 --> 44:48.294
Look at you!

44:49.774 --> 44:51.210
Look at you now. You can't
even take care of yourself.

44:59.044 --> 45:01.176
I can't take care
of our family without you.

45:02.221 --> 45:04.049
I cannot lose you again.

45:09.576 --> 45:10.359
This is the only way.

45:11.621 --> 45:12.405
You need them.

45:37.299 --> 45:38.344
Rest.

45:38.866 --> 45:40.346
Things will be better
in the morning.

45:42.261 --> 45:43.305
You'll see.

45:46.308 --> 45:47.396
I'll make dinner tonight.

45:50.835 --> 45:52.837
I'm thinking risotto.

46:37.882 --> 46:38.665
Ah.

46:40.885 --> 46:41.668
See?

46:44.018 --> 46:44.802
Who is that?

46:46.107 --> 46:47.108
That's my sister.

46:48.066 --> 46:49.110
Sophie.

46:51.243 --> 46:52.287
She looks like you.

46:53.549 --> 46:54.812
You must miss your sister a lot.

46:55.943 --> 46:56.944
What happened to Abbey?

46:58.946 --> 47:01.079
I don't remember
Abbey that much.

47:01.906 --> 47:02.602
Is that bad?

47:03.516 --> 47:04.560
Of course not.

47:05.910 --> 47:07.433
She used to get
in trouble all the time.

47:10.088 --> 47:12.438
Dad would always yell at her and
then everything would be fine.

47:14.788 --> 47:15.571
Not that day.

47:17.704 --> 47:18.836
What happened that day?

47:20.925 --> 47:21.751
That day...

47:22.840 --> 47:24.102
Mom found something of Abbey's.

47:24.972 --> 47:25.843
Something really bad.

47:28.541 --> 47:29.585
She ran away.

47:32.675 --> 47:34.199
They found her body
by the shore.

47:36.157 --> 47:37.550
She ate a bunch
of the bad berries.

47:39.508 --> 47:41.336
We've always known
about the bad berries.

47:41.380 --> 47:42.860
Dad made sure we knew.

47:44.426 --> 47:45.601
What are the bad berries?

47:47.125 --> 47:47.995
They grow all around.

47:49.083 --> 47:50.780
A single one could kill you.

47:51.346 --> 47:52.347
Dad would always tell us.

47:54.480 --> 47:55.960
Dad said it was an accident.

47:58.005 --> 48:00.442
Ray said that
she killed herself.

48:02.662 --> 48:04.316
Ray always told me the truth.

50:19.364 --> 50:20.147
Abbey!

50:21.148 --> 50:23.368
Abbey, you sweet girl!

50:24.717 --> 50:26.893
Oh, I'm so sorry! Mom!

50:26.936 --> 50:29.287
- Mrs. Beaty--
- I'm so sorry-- No!

50:29.330 --> 50:30.157
I'm so sorry.

50:30.201 --> 50:31.245
Fred!

50:33.378 --> 50:34.422
Fred!

50:37.469 --> 50:38.513
It's okay, Mom. It's me.

50:39.210 --> 50:40.037
No!

50:41.429 --> 50:42.430
No! Let go of me!

50:42.474 --> 50:43.692
- Mom!
- Let go!

50:45.868 --> 50:47.218
Mom. It's okay. You'll be okay.

50:47.740 --> 50:49.437
No, no, no! Let go.

50:50.438 --> 50:51.526
No, please...

50:52.223 --> 50:53.093
Can you sit with her?

50:55.008 --> 50:56.618
Come, it's okay. No!

51:29.303 --> 51:32.089
I'm sorry.

51:34.787 --> 51:35.875
Sorry!

52:32.497 --> 52:33.976
Don't pretend you
didn't hear that.

52:35.848 --> 52:37.850
You really shouldn't
indulge her that way.

52:37.893 --> 52:39.286
It's the last thing
she needs right now.

52:56.521 --> 52:57.304
What happened to you?

52:59.219 --> 53:03.092
What made you the heartless, horrible
human being you are now, hmm?

53:05.660 --> 53:09.882
Whatever happens in the end, wherever
you go, if you go to these caves,

53:10.361 --> 53:13.799
or you go to fucking hell,
I'm not coming with you.

53:32.165 --> 53:32.948
Dinner's ready!

53:36.822 --> 53:37.823
Is she all right?

53:38.432 --> 53:39.216
Yeah, she's fine.

53:40.956 --> 53:42.001
She understands.

53:43.307 --> 53:45.222
She understands
her mother's gone crazy?

53:47.224 --> 53:48.007
No, don't say that.

54:01.760 --> 54:02.978
That day...

54:05.938 --> 54:06.852
That day that you left...

54:11.117 --> 54:11.944
So proud of you.

54:15.077 --> 54:16.949
Telling your father
what you wanted.

54:19.386 --> 54:20.213
What you needed.

54:22.998 --> 54:24.173
God knows I never...

54:26.350 --> 54:27.525
I never could.

54:36.490 --> 54:37.796
But you're stronger than him.

54:41.365 --> 54:42.453
Don't let him destroy you.

54:50.112 --> 54:51.157
Come on, Mom.

54:51.549 --> 54:52.332
Ray.

54:55.509 --> 54:56.554
I know.

55:00.775 --> 55:02.342
I know who you are.

55:10.568 --> 55:11.351
My little boy.

55:13.397 --> 55:14.180
So...

55:15.573 --> 55:17.488
So proud of my little boy.

55:24.625 --> 55:28.063
Come on, Mom.
Let's get some rest, okay?

55:28.107 --> 55:29.151
Lay down.

55:52.914 --> 55:53.698
Gina?

55:59.834 --> 56:00.966
Georgina!

56:38.264 --> 56:39.657
It was my father's favorite.

56:43.269 --> 56:44.879
Dad, please.
You've got to call them.

56:46.490 --> 56:49.014
Martin Beaty wasn't
a lot of things.

56:49.057 --> 56:51.625
Well, he wasn't...

56:52.060 --> 56:54.454
he wasn't most things, actually,

56:55.194 --> 56:56.413
but he had great taste in music.

56:57.718 --> 56:58.371
Dad.

57:00.721 --> 57:01.505
He'll call, son.

57:02.767 --> 57:03.855
He will call.

57:05.291 --> 57:06.510
He has to. You know
all I've done for the senator.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.426
Now come on, eat.
Get some food in your stomach.

57:09.469 --> 57:10.688
We're going hunting
after dinner.

57:12.951 --> 57:13.995
Hunting?

57:15.649 --> 57:17.695
Dad, it's too dark to hunt.

57:18.957 --> 57:20.698
There's not gonna be anything
out there, it's too cold.

57:21.307 --> 57:23.135
- There'll be something.
- What is wrong with you?

57:23.483 --> 57:25.050
For God's sake, call them!

57:25.093 --> 57:26.965
We can't live like
this much longer!

57:28.445 --> 57:31.448
You will live however I want you
to live, do you understand me?

57:36.061 --> 57:37.758
Margot, my dear, please, come.

57:37.802 --> 57:39.238
Come sit with us, please. Eat.

57:41.545 --> 57:42.546
Please sit.

57:46.419 --> 57:48.290
I'm afraid that Gina's
not feeling too well.

57:48.552 --> 57:52.338
So, I apologize,
but the risotto is a little dry

57:52.381 --> 57:54.949
and, um, we're out of red,
sadly.

57:57.474 --> 57:58.692
You are all insane.

58:02.914 --> 58:04.176
I remember this part.

58:06.091 --> 58:08.528
- Foscari goes to visit his son in prison.
- I'm leaving, Fred. Tonight.

58:08.572 --> 58:13.315
He tells him that although he loves
him dearly, his duty must come first.

58:13.620 --> 58:15.230
Your mother isn't well, Fred.

58:16.275 --> 58:17.885
Somebody has to do something.

58:19.278 --> 58:20.497
She needs-- She needs what?

58:22.803 --> 58:23.412
Help?

58:24.892 --> 58:26.328
Medical attention?

58:27.852 --> 58:30.289
I'm afraid, my dear,
she needs much more than that.

58:30.898 --> 58:32.552
She needs to talk to somebody.

58:32.596 --> 58:33.901
Well, you're the psychologist.

58:35.250 --> 58:36.295
Why not you?

58:37.688 --> 58:39.428
You tell her that everything
is going to be okay.

58:40.691 --> 58:43.041
Tell her how to find
inner peace and love.

58:43.694 --> 58:45.870
Tell her that the sun
will come back up tomorrow,

58:45.913 --> 58:47.741
tell her she didn't
kill her daughter.

58:50.570 --> 58:54.356
Do not tell me
what my wife needs.

58:55.183 --> 58:56.663
I know what she needs.

58:58.622 --> 59:02.756
She needs to be taken away from here
to someplace safe, someplace warm.

59:03.191 --> 59:04.976
She needs hope. She needs me.

59:08.109 --> 59:09.197
I'm going to get my gear.

59:09.894 --> 59:10.677
Meet me out front.

59:34.179 --> 59:35.093
Goodbye, Fred.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.604
Turn it off. Turn it off.

01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:31.018
Get down!

01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:53.737
Get out.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.696
Get out! Get out!

01:00:58.916 --> 01:00:59.960
Fred!

01:01:00.874 --> 01:01:02.093
Fred, open the door!

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.660
Fred!

01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:05.270
No!

01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:07.751
Fred!

01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:09.666
Fred, please let me in.

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:12.277
I just want to go home.

01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:05.417
What are you doing here?

01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:10.204
When I heard your voice,
I knew I had to be with you.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:12.729
The stars, remember?

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:17.037
It's getting bad out there.

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:22.956
People in the streets,
they're not acting normal.

01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:25.089
This is it.

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.875
It's happening, Ray,
I want to be with you.

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:35.752
I come all this way to see you
and all you can do is shrug?

01:02:39.233 --> 01:02:40.234
What do you want, Brian?

01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:43.498
I want to come with you
to the caves.

01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:47.459
No. I'm not going
to any caves.

01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:50.375
Then I want to spend my last
few days with you, I don't care.

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:53.247
We can't here.

01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:55.423
Then come away with me.

01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:59.166
Just you and me,
like we always talked about.

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.428
I can't leave Clara,
you know that.

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:02.300
I love you, Ray.

01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.050
I can't.

01:03:14.834 --> 01:03:15.748
I'm so sorry.

01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:18.359
Whoever is out there,

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:22.494
whoever you are, get off
my land or I'll shoot you!

01:03:24.409 --> 01:03:25.802
Please go. Please go. No, I won't!

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:27.151
Do you hear me?

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:29.022
No, I'm not leaving you.
I won't go without you.

01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:30.458
Just go! Please leave!

01:03:31.068 --> 01:03:31.851
Just go!

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:35.376
Just go.

01:03:38.118 --> 01:03:38.902
You're a coward.

01:03:42.383 --> 01:03:43.297
You hear me?

01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:05.570
Hello?

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:07.224
Hello?

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:09.356
Bill.

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:11.663
I'm so glad you called.

01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:14.057
I knew you would call!

01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:15.014
I knew it, Bill!

01:06:15.493 --> 01:06:16.755
Uh...

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:19.714
We're packed.
We're ready to go.

01:06:21.325 --> 01:06:21.978
What?

01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:26.025
I don't understand.

01:06:29.115 --> 01:06:31.988
What-- What do you mean?
What about the caves?

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:37.994
Yes.

01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:01.588
What time is it?

01:10:02.763 --> 01:10:04.025
It's eight in the morning.

01:10:07.377 --> 01:10:08.204
What happened?

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.118
You tell me.

01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:11.772
Ray said you had an accident.

01:10:12.295 --> 01:10:13.078
In your car.

01:10:14.906 --> 01:10:15.950
Where were you going?

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.040
Well, we were
running out of food...

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:25.090
and I thought I could
find some somewhere.

01:10:35.753 --> 01:10:36.928
The lights don't work anymore.

01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:41.672
Ray said he heard
the phone ring.

01:10:42.586 --> 01:10:43.630
Who was it?

01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:46.851
Was it Bill?

01:10:47.808 --> 01:10:48.853
What did he say?

01:11:01.474 --> 01:11:03.084
They're coming for us. Tomorrow.

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:07.045
It's over.

01:11:12.703 --> 01:11:13.921
It's gonna be cold.

01:11:15.662 --> 01:11:18.186
We should all stay together by
the fire until they come tomorrow.

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:23.670
Mom, we need you.

01:11:33.898 --> 01:11:35.334
Okay. It's time. It's time.

01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:36.988
What, here? Now? Yes.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:38.685
Everybody out! Everybody out!

01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:40.861
No, no, no. Fred, you stay.

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:41.993
I need your help, come on.Okay.

01:11:42.602 --> 01:11:43.342
Let's go.

01:11:46.214 --> 01:11:46.998
Will she be all right?

01:11:50.741 --> 01:11:51.524
Yeah, she'll be fine.

01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:56.268
Daddy, are they really
coming for us tomorrow?

01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:58.575
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:01.795
How much stuff can I pack?

01:12:03.014 --> 01:12:04.058
As much as you want.

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:14.634
I'm gonna go finish packing.

01:12:22.903 --> 01:12:24.122
So what are you gonna do?

01:12:24.862 --> 01:12:26.124
Just gonna kill us all?

01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:43.402
We are a bunch of cowards,
aren't we?

01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:49.930
Is she coming?

01:13:53.472 --> 01:13:55.082
Do you think there'll be
cute boys there?

01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:57.824
At the caves.Mmm.

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:01.480
Mmm. There'll be lots
of cute boys with that one.

01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:02.525
Good.

01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:06.920
Margot, push.

01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:12.883
She's coming.

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:15.668
It's okay.

01:14:43.217 --> 01:14:44.305
Push.

01:14:55.403 --> 01:14:57.318
Oh, my God. I see the head.

01:14:59.712 --> 01:15:00.800
Margot, push!

01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:09.243
Okay. Okay.

01:15:19.645 --> 01:15:20.690
Wow.

01:15:21.908 --> 01:15:22.648
You're an aunt.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.084
I'm an aunt.

01:15:26.391 --> 01:15:27.784
That makes you an uncle.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.399
Okay, okay.

01:15:34.442 --> 01:15:35.835
Claudine.

01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:37.794
It's okay.

01:16:03.123 --> 01:16:04.342
Jesus.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.406
How's the baby?

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:27.757
Healthy.

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:29.628
That's good.

01:16:32.544 --> 01:16:33.327
That's good.

01:16:35.939 --> 01:16:36.983
Look at you.

01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:42.293
I remember the moment
when I first saw you.

01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:46.210
You were so beautiful, perfect.

01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:49.822
I'd never seen anything
so perfect.

01:16:52.869 --> 01:16:54.827
It was the first moment
in my life that I felt...

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:01.312
joy.

01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:05.316
Thank you, Gina.

01:17:10.103 --> 01:17:11.148
For choosing me.

01:17:13.019 --> 01:17:14.064
For everything.

01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:33.344
I'll go get dinner together.

01:17:57.237 --> 01:17:58.282
She's cold.

01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:05.898
It'll all be over tomorrow.

01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:25.265
We made it, Dad.

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:28.791
It's over.

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:49.550
Where did you go?

01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:01.753
Dad. What's going on?

01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:14.810
During different times,
I would have rung the doorbell.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:17.464
What do you want?

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.292
Oh, we aren't here
to harm anyone.

01:20:20.467 --> 01:20:22.078
Enough harm's been done
already, wouldn't you agree?

01:20:22.469 --> 01:20:23.601
We don't have much.

01:20:30.913 --> 01:20:34.307
What kind of a husband
and a father would I be

01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:36.266
if I didn't provide
for my family?

01:20:38.485 --> 01:20:39.312
Food's in the basement.

01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:47.103
No! That's mine!

01:20:47.146 --> 01:20:48.060
Clara, be quiet.

01:20:50.584 --> 01:20:52.543
- Daddy, it's for the caves.
- I said be quiet!

01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:53.631
No, no.

01:20:55.285 --> 01:20:56.068
It's all right.

01:21:01.769 --> 01:21:04.685
Hey. You can tell me.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.908
Is your daddy taking you
somewhere, princess?

01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:11.431
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

01:21:13.172 --> 01:21:14.217
Where's that?

01:21:19.091 --> 01:21:20.223
To the safe place.

01:21:22.312 --> 01:21:23.356
The caves.

01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:29.710
What caves?

01:21:37.109 --> 01:21:38.067
You got a way out?

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:39.503
There's no room for you.

01:21:39.546 --> 01:21:40.852
Clara, just be quiet.

01:21:42.462 --> 01:21:44.377
What caves,
you son of a bitch?

01:21:44.421 --> 01:21:45.726
Dad, just tell them
about the caves.

01:21:46.292 --> 01:21:47.990
Dad. Tell them.

01:21:51.341 --> 01:21:52.472
There are no caves.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.564
There never were.

01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:08.793
Caves...

01:22:09.402 --> 01:22:10.403
Let's go.

01:22:41.608 --> 01:22:44.307
You have a very civilized
household here.

01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:48.006
You should see some of the places
we've visited, just animals.

01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:55.448
My car is in the garage.

01:23:00.497 --> 01:23:02.803
You could get in. Just go.

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:06.111
Get away from here.

01:23:29.178 --> 01:23:30.222
Where is he?

01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:32.137
What did you do with him? He's dead.

01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:34.226
He was never gonna save you.

01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:35.662
He couldn't!

01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:37.273
Nobody can.

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.625
It's over.

01:24:41.641 --> 01:24:42.425
Where are you going?

01:26:15.039 --> 01:26:16.040
I don't feel well.

01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:20.914
I know.

01:26:23.743 --> 01:26:24.788
I'm scared.

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:27.007
Don't be.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.445
Will it hurt?

01:26:33.013 --> 01:26:33.797
I promise it won't.

01:26:38.758 --> 01:26:39.977
Do you think
there's a heaven?

01:26:40.543 --> 01:26:41.326
I think so.

01:26:42.545 --> 01:26:43.589
I hope so.

01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:50.640
What do you think it's like?

01:26:51.554 --> 01:26:53.425
Well, I think
it's pretty amazing.

01:26:55.079 --> 01:26:56.863
It's warm, but not too warm.

01:26:59.649 --> 01:27:01.303
And all your
favorite food is there.

01:27:02.565 --> 01:27:03.609
And candy.

01:27:05.437 --> 01:27:06.221
Chocolate.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.005
Lots of chocolate.

01:27:09.615 --> 01:27:11.878
And there's water everywhere
for you to swim in it.

01:27:12.923 --> 01:27:14.794
Water that cradles
you from head to toe.

01:27:15.534 --> 01:27:16.840
You can dance...

01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:20.931
all day long if you want to.

01:27:24.717 --> 01:27:26.719
And there's no troubles
or worries...

01:27:33.422 --> 01:27:34.249
just quiet.

01:27:37.861 --> 01:27:38.949
Peace.

01:27:42.431 --> 01:27:44.346
And all your favorite people
are there.

01:27:52.745 --> 01:27:53.703
Abbey will be there.

01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:59.665
Oh, yes.

01:28:02.842 --> 01:28:03.887
Abbey will be there.
