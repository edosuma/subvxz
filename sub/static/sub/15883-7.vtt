00:04.091 --> 00:05.790
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

00:06.016 --> 00:08.239
I'd just to thank you
for your continued faith

00:09.745 --> 00:10.979
(screaming)
We won!

00:11.099 --> 00:12.666
That's my anger translator,
Luther.

00:12.798 --> 00:14.198
Whoo!

00:14.241 --> 00:15.407
Yeah! What's up?

00:15.708 --> 00:16.541
(humming)
♪ Mm mm-mm mm ♪

00:16.609 --> 00:17.943
♪ Mm mm mm-mm ♪

00:18.011 --> 00:20.329
But I want to wish
my opponent, Mitt Romney, well.

00:20.777 --> 00:21.823
He ran a good campaign.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.448
Take that [bleep]
back to the lab, Mitt,

00:23.516 --> 00:24.612
'cause you lost!

00:24.738 --> 00:27.154
And now we move forward
with pressing issues.

00:27.187 --> 00:29.255
We gonna pass Healthcare
<i>again</i>.

00:29.555 --> 00:30.640
Now what, bitches?

00:30.839 --> 00:33.674
While we had huge turnout
from our faithful supporters...

00:33.769 --> 00:34.969
Thank you, black folks!

00:34.984 --> 00:37.444
We made it to two elections
in a row, man!

00:37.497 --> 00:38.645
Now how hard was that?

00:38.785 --> 00:40.784
All your votes were crucial
in this victory.

00:40.839 --> 00:41.972
White people
who voted for me,

00:42.131 --> 00:44.332
y'all are all now
honorary black people.

00:44.361 --> 00:46.167
So thank you
for your support.

00:46.277 --> 00:48.661
And [bleep] you
if you tried to [bleep] me!

00:48.686 --> 00:49.986
I mean, you know how much money
they tried to spend

00:50.041 --> 00:50.767
to get rid of this?

00:50.807 --> 00:52.942
Millions, son!
I said millions!

00:53.535 --> 00:54.802
But you couldn't get rid
of a [bleep].

00:54.843 --> 00:55.943
Aw, naw.

00:55.985 --> 00:57.271
Yeah, can't touch this.

00:57.283 --> 00:58.114
Luther.

00:58.149 --> 00:59.300
N... Luther,
what'd I tell you?

00:59.385 --> 01:00.285
No Hammer dancing.

01:00.353 --> 01:01.307
Come on, "B"!

01:01.351 --> 01:02.618
We won!
Let's do it, dog!

01:02.633 --> 01:04.667
No, I'm, uh,
I-I-I told you,

01:04.669 --> 01:06.285
I don't want you
doing it wrong.

01:06.303 --> 01:07.570
- Ohh.
- You gotta get it right.

01:07.636 --> 01:08.602
- Ohh!
- If you're gonna do it...

01:08.805 --> 01:10.039
God bless America.

01:10.129 --> 01:11.029
Oh, that's right,

- Yes, welcome to the show.

01:54.628 --> 01:56.228
Um, are you guys
sick of politics?

01:56.274 --> 01:57.574
(Audience:) Yeah!

01:57.619 --> 01:59.787
Okay.

01:59.878 --> 02:01.445
Okay.

02:01.490 --> 02:02.456
We're done.

02:02.796 --> 02:04.101
Well, thank God.

02:04.136 --> 02:05.632
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- We are finished for a while.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.341
Anyway...

02:06.388 --> 02:08.729
We have this theory
that these pop stars

02:08.729 --> 02:10.146
that claim that
they party all the time,

02:10.152 --> 02:11.693
- There's no way...
- It's impossible.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.373
That they actually party
that much.

02:13.396 --> 02:14.763
- Can't party full time.
- You can't do that.

02:14.808 --> 02:16.824

a pop song about resting.

Where's that song?

02:23.777 --> 02:25.637
Party, party, party.
You can't party that much.

02:25.682 --> 02:28.827
Nobody can party that much.
You're partying too much,

02:28.962 --> 02:31.094
And it's gotta take a toll
eventually, I'm sick of it!

02:31.181 --> 02:32.581

Oh! Oh!

05:09.016 --> 05:11.084
Oh!
Nice! Nice!

05:11.121 --> 05:12.755
Yes. Dude.

05:12.793 --> 05:15.562
You have absolutely
mastered this game.

05:15.689 --> 05:18.062
Yeah, well, since,
um, Sheila left,

05:18.069 --> 05:20.764
I've been spending
a lot of time playing the game.

05:20.958 --> 05:23.226
- You're doing really good.
- Thank you.

05:23.264 --> 05:25.231
That's why
we're here, man.

05:25.479 --> 05:27.775
Help you get over Sh... her.

05:28.174 --> 05:30.684
And check out this
awesome new game you have!

05:30.751 --> 05:32.018
(weakly)
Yay.

05:32.085 --> 05:33.886
You know, I left something
in another room.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.445
Um, excuse me, everyone.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.134
Oh, he still
has the sensors on.

05:41.142 --> 05:42.128
(chuckles)

05:42.196 --> 05:43.596
- Oh, look.
- Is that him in his room?

05:43.634 --> 05:46.135
Yeah. You can see him.
That's funny. What is he doing?

05:46.143 --> 05:48.637
Is he... is he on his knees?

05:48.738 --> 05:51.755
- Did he drop to his knees?
- Oh, n... (chuckles)

05:51.793 --> 05:52.914
- Oh...
- That... that...

05:52.942 --> 05:54.154
He's probably looking for...

05:54.198 --> 05:56.065
No, look.
He's... he's crying.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.336
- He's crying. Oh, no.
- He's just...

05:58.336 --> 06:00.291
- No, no, he's shuddering.
- That's just shaking.

06:00.291 --> 06:02.379
He's shuddering.
Is he fetal?

06:02.453 --> 06:04.452
Yeah, he curled up.
Look at that. He's fetal.

06:04.524 --> 06:07.359
Hey, Craig, buddy.
You all right up there?

06:07.457 --> 06:10.056
Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm coming right out.

06:11.990 --> 06:13.824
Oh, he... um...

06:14.745 --> 06:17.447
Hey, man, you all right?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.518
Yes. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

06:19.578 --> 06:21.821
It's just, uh, my sinuses...
(sniffs) are acting up. Yeah.

06:22.013 --> 06:23.488
Yeah, I, um...

06:23.568 --> 06:25.563
I was just... you know, I was
just thinking about Sheila,

06:25.657 --> 06:26.757
and you know what?

06:26.884 --> 06:28.484
I'm... I am totally over her.

06:28.673 --> 06:29.626
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.189
Let's... hey,
let's get this party started.

06:33.289 --> 06:34.722
Sure.
Oh.

06:36.881 --> 06:38.601
Uh...

06:39.359 --> 06:41.350
I forgot to get rid of this
picture of Sheila. Excuse me.

06:41.419 --> 06:43.587
Hey, maybe leave the sensors
so one of us can play.

06:43.745 --> 06:45.574
(game music begins)

06:45.699 --> 06:48.034
Oh, he's dancing.

06:48.222 --> 06:50.657
He's dancing with the photo.
Is he ki...

06:50.664 --> 06:51.995
He's doing...
he's doing this a bunch.

06:52.039 --> 06:53.632
- All right.
- Is he kissing it?

06:54.095 --> 06:55.228
I think he's kissing it.

06:55.296 --> 06:56.425
Know what?
I'm gonna turn this off.

06:56.470 --> 06:58.504
- 'cause we don't need to...
- You change it and you die.

06:59.054 --> 07:00.360
He's undoing his buckle.

07:00.398 --> 07:01.800
Look at this.
His pants are coming off.

07:01.813 --> 07:02.913
His pants are coming off.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.218
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

07:05.226 --> 07:06.666
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

07:06.704 --> 07:08.549
- Okay, that's happening.
- Oh, no, no, no.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.851
- My God.
- Is he... He's...

07:10.918 --> 07:12.170
He is totally on the bed.
- Yeah.

07:12.233 --> 07:13.252
He's totally flat
on the bed.

07:13.312 --> 07:15.659
Oh, maybe he's shaking a can...
of hairspray...

07:15.730 --> 07:17.864
- Oh! Oh, God.
- Oh, gross. (groans)

07:21.562 --> 07:24.697
We sh... we shouldn't be...
Okay, you know...

07:24.730 --> 07:26.197
Is he reaching down
for his foot?

07:26.197 --> 07:27.495
- I don't...
- That's his foot, isn't it?

07:27.549 --> 07:29.843
- Is that his foot?
- I don't know.

07:30.888 --> 07:33.289
And coming back.

07:35.052 --> 07:36.712
Whew.

07:37.702 --> 07:39.851
I am sorry, everybody.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.000
Would you like me
to make some snacks?

07:46.038 --> 07:47.689
Wash your hands first?

07:49.687 --> 07:51.688
(soul music)

07:52.560 --> 07:55.109
You know, we both spend
a good deal of time in Chicago,

07:55.165 --> 07:58.467
and, uh, when you go to Chicago,
to Wrigleyville,

07:58.488 --> 08:00.789
The bars around that ar...
Whoo!

08:00.790 --> 08:02.424
- Mm. It's just...
- They're drunk.

08:02.498 --> 08:04.031
- They get [bleep] up.

08:04.099 --> 08:06.501
We saw one time
a string of five women,

08:06.568 --> 08:08.157
And there was a woman,
like, hanging on...

08:08.225 --> 08:10.359
It was like woman, woman,
woman, woman, Raggedy Ann doll.

08:10.450 --> 08:11.706
It was just...

08:11.719 --> 08:13.186
She was just,
like, doing this, like...

08:13.231 --> 08:17.114
Anyway, Sophia's never gonna
get back to the car, seriously.

08:17.668 --> 08:19.035
What the [bleep]
am I supposed to...

08:19.081 --> 08:20.905
- She was supposed to be driving!
- Get off me!

08:21.028 --> 08:22.627
I've [bleep]
never driven an Audi.

08:22.796 --> 08:24.964
How do you drive an Audi,
Sophia?

08:25.010 --> 08:26.710
Get the [bleep] off of me.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.612
You can't even [bleep]...
fine.

08:28.657 --> 08:30.869
And she... boom.
She drops.

08:30.975 --> 08:31.859
Pretty much.

08:31.927 --> 08:33.660
So this scene
is about that girl.

08:37.246 --> 08:39.390
- Are you kidding me?
- No!

08:39.501 --> 08:41.565
Seriously, you've gotta
come back in the bar right now.

08:41.602 --> 08:42.870
You come back in the bar!

08:42.895 --> 08:44.672
Megan, I don't even
[bleep] know Claire!

08:44.740 --> 08:45.600
Yeah, right!

08:45.641 --> 08:47.256
I'm sorry!
You left your jacket!

08:47.299 --> 08:49.977
Yeah, well, why don't you give it
to your new, fat, ugly girlfriend?

08:50.001 --> 08:52.236
- I haven't even met her yet!
- Whatever!

08:52.304 --> 08:54.104
You left your jacket,
Megan!

08:54.127 --> 08:57.463
- Oh, throw it in a river!
- Why would I [bleep] do that?

08:57.575 --> 09:00.360
- I don't care, I'm over it!
- Fine!

I mean, who does that?

Megan,
come back to the bar!

09:22.611 --> 09:26.347
- You're <i>literally</i> an asshole!
- How is that possible?

09:26.370 --> 09:28.971
I can't be an asshole.
I got arms and legs and a head!

09:31.654 --> 09:32.739

09:32.765 --> 09:33.526
No!

That's really nice.

10:07.812 --> 10:10.035

Megan? Damn!

10:10.058 --> 10:11.659
Kiss my butthole, okay?

10:11.727 --> 10:14.652
Good! Fine! Fine! Then I'm going!
I'm leaving right now!

- No!

10:26.496 --> 10:29.498

- Whatever!

Why you readin', bitch?

11:23.114 --> 11:25.230
Because I like to read,
and this is a really good book.

11:25.298 --> 11:28.033
You're a really good bitch,
bitch.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.624

11:35.811 --> 11:37.892
I really don't want
to get left back,

11:37.985 --> 11:40.086

reading for fun,

11:40.482 --> 11:42.750

that much more stupid!

11:42.818 --> 11:45.686

Um, I didn't
know that. I...

11:48.290 --> 11:49.851
Thanks so much
for opening up to me...

11:49.895 --> 11:53.022
- Shut up, queer!
- I don't understand.

11:53.081 --> 11:54.578

why you gotta go there?

11:54.952 --> 11:56.297

the other guys at school.

11:59.654 --> 12:01.088
- What?
- Gimme that!

12:01.573 --> 12:04.214
I'm afraid of these feelings
and what they might mean.

12:04.347 --> 12:06.048
It's like, because
I hate myself so much,

towards you!

on such a deep level that...

- Whoa!

12:15.317 --> 12:16.833
Now I'm gonna
punish you physically

12:16.860 --> 12:18.359

my emotional problems!

12:19.273 --> 12:21.005
I was gonna say if you
understand yourself so well,

12:21.008 --> 12:23.160
then maybe you should
try working on changing it.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.326
Of course
I want to change it!

12:25.394 --> 12:27.628
But it's the only
defense mechanism I have

12:27.696 --> 12:30.831
against deeper, more terrifying
problems buried inside of me!
