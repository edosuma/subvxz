WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:03.837
KRISTIN: We got a little
problem with the restaurant.

00:03.871 --> 00:05.806
Our Sunday brunches
are in the red.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.908
All-you-can-eat might've
been a mistake in a store

00:07.941 --> 00:10.278
that caters to lumberjacks.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.548
Okay. I think you're looking
at this the wrong way.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.984
Really? The wrong way?
I don't, um...

00:17.017 --> 00:18.852
Huh-- oh, look at that.
Hey, yeah, you're right.

00:18.886 --> 00:22.256
Now we're making money.
And it's summer.

00:22.290 --> 00:25.159
Honey, think of it
as a loss leader, okay?

00:25.193 --> 00:26.894
Sundays are kind of slow
in the store.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.762
The buffet brings people in.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.264
Lose a little money
at the Grill,

00:30.298 --> 00:31.699
but we're kicking ass
in the store.

00:31.732 --> 00:35.403
I call it my ying...
and ka-ching.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.406
Mm, I knew I had
a brilliant plan.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.607
I just didn't know what it was.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.075
-Thanks, Dad.
-You bet.

00:41.109 --> 00:44.112
Um-- (clears throat)
Small problem, Baxter.

00:44.145 --> 00:48.048
We need to replace the security
camera in the loading dock.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.050
Somebody stole it.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.652
(chuckling)

00:53.087 --> 00:54.688
Come on.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.425
Somebody stole
the security camera.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.026
You don't see the irony there?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.629
Yes. I was just
hoping you wouldn't.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.464
Yeah.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.633
Huge problem, Mike, huge.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.202
Kyle and Mandy have signed up
for ballroom dancing

01:08.236 --> 01:09.737
on Thursday nights.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.472
I blame Groupon.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.477
Oh, oh, 'cause Thursday night
is our poker night.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.312
But that's okay.
We'll just play with four.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.248
No, four is bad luck for poker.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.049
No-no-no. You know how many
people were playing

01:22.082 --> 01:24.252
the night that
Wild Bill Hickok was murdered?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.788
-Four?
-No, five.

01:29.123 --> 01:33.060
But after he was shot
in the back, four.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.995
So we either find a fifth

01:35.028 --> 01:37.565
or we get our horses,
ride out of town nightfall.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.567
Hyah, gunnery! Come on now!
Hyah! Hyah!

01:39.600 --> 01:41.001
I'll find somebody.
I'll find somebody.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.303
No, no, you don't find anybody.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.771
The last time
you looked for somebody,

01:43.804 --> 01:45.506
you know who you found? Joe.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.075
Oh-- (scoffs)
Uh, you really gonna complain

01:48.108 --> 01:50.244
about a poker player
who thinks out loud?

01:50.278 --> 01:53.481
(imitating Joe):
"Uh, you know, I should fold...

01:53.514 --> 01:56.016
but I'm not gonna."

01:57.017 --> 01:59.387
*

02:03.857 --> 02:08.095
Steve, come on. A poker game
is exactly what you need.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.831
It'll take your mind
off the funeral.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.134
Steve... it's what your mom
would've wanted.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.872
Hello? Hello? Hello!

02:18.906 --> 02:21.442
Still trying to find somebody
to play in the poker game?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.680
Steve passed and
apparently so did his mom.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.317
Hey, what... what about you?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.385
-Me?
-You're smart,

02:31.419 --> 02:33.221
you-you're a-a fast learner,

02:33.254 --> 02:36.123
and even if you win,
it's still our money.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.226
-Oh. Uh, well, sure, sure.
-Good.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.561
Yeah, then you can join me
for our next book club.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.062
It's Maya Angelou week.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.131
You're out. You're out.
You're out.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.667
-Namaste, fellow travelers.
-Hi.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.870
-MIKE: Hey, there.
-Hey, here are the quarterlies
from the pot shop.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.505
-(Vanessa clears throat)
-Okay, great.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.574
(mouthing)

02:53.607 --> 02:55.476
-No.
-This is about me, isn't it?

02:55.509 --> 02:59.547
Well, the cards have been dealt,
now play the game.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.149
I'm going to fold.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.118
(laughs):
Okay, I'm gonna fold. Oh.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.089
Listen, don't make a big deal
about this,

03:09.122 --> 03:11.859
but I'd like to invite you
to play poker with the guys

03:11.892 --> 03:13.160
on Thursday.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.495
You know,
what I'm really hearing

03:14.528 --> 03:16.163
is that you want to spend
some more time

03:16.196 --> 03:17.598
with your favorite son-in-law.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.600
My favorite son-in-law
is taking dance lessons.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.934
That's why I'm asking you.

03:20.968 --> 03:24.104
Okay, you know what?
I will play as long as you admit

03:24.137 --> 03:26.240
that you, Mike Baxter,
want to spend time

03:26.274 --> 03:27.908
with me, Ryan Vogelson.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.877
-I won't mean it.
-I don't care.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.346
This is why I don't like
asking you stuff.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.181
Because you make
everything so difficult.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.216
Still don't care.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.722
Would you please play poker
with us on Thursday,

03:41.755 --> 03:45.025
so I can spend more time
with you?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.660
And who am I?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.064
-Ryan Vogelson...
-Mm-hmm?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.900
...my favorite son-in-law.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.569
Well, in that case,
I would be honored to.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.904
Thank you, Mike.

03:56.937 --> 04:01.008
Don't thank me. Thank Steve
and his dumb dead mom.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.947
Main menu, yeah.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.083
Main me-- main menu.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.554
I, uh-- r-representative.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.988
(stammers)

04:15.022 --> 04:18.959
Rep-re-sen-ta-ti--

04:18.992 --> 04:20.994
You know what?
Just tell them I'll call back

04:21.028 --> 04:22.796
after I've had wine.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.134
-You're using the phone
to make a call?
-(sighs)

04:27.167 --> 04:30.103
I heard people still do that.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.272
How was school?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.941
Interesting.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.344
In chemistry class, somebody
mixed hydrogen and chlorine.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.780
-Ooh, that will explode.
-It did.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.616
We lost two windows
and five eyebrows.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.488
But all anyone
can talk about is prom.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.458
Ooh. So prom's coming up?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.292
How exciting.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.862
-Blah.
-Aw.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.830
Why does everyone make
such a big deal about it?

04:56.864 --> 04:58.366
-It's so lame.
-Mm.

04:58.399 --> 05:01.502
-Haven't been asked yet?
-No. And I'm dying to go.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.437
I know. Hey, Mandy.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.439
-We were just talking about...
-I'm too busy, Mom, sorry.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.907
-...prom.
-Oh, my God!

05:08.976 --> 05:12.279
What's the date?
What's the theme? Who's the boy?

05:12.312 --> 05:16.784
The 15th. Caribbean Nights.
And Adam St. Cloud.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.852
(sighs):
Oh, so he's Catholic.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.557
-How did he ask you?
-He hasn't.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.192
Not a problem. Ask him.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.361
-I can do that?
-Oh, yeah, of course.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.363
It's 2019. (chuckles)

05:29.397 --> 05:32.800
Oh, wow, is it really 2019?

05:32.833 --> 05:35.168
So, um, my sophomore year,
I asked a boy--

05:35.202 --> 05:36.870
well, I told a boy to ask me.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.506
But that was all part
of a bigger plan

05:38.539 --> 05:40.140
to get this other boy to ask me.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.043
Prom was my busy time of year.
(chuckles)

05:43.076 --> 05:45.446
Well, it certainly
wasn't finals. (chuckles)

05:47.681 --> 05:50.150
Okay. Um, now, what are
we gonna have you wear?

05:50.183 --> 05:53.053
I am seeing a tropical
print dress, an updo,

05:53.086 --> 05:54.488
possibly an orchid.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.557
(squeals) Adam St. Cloud
is gonna be blown away.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.793
(chuckles) It'll be
the second time this week.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.531
He was in that chemistry class.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.236
Three, three, three,
three, three.

06:09.269 --> 06:12.072
Four, four, four, four.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.141
Five, five, five, five.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.379
Yeah, it's like playing cards
on Sesame Street.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.249
All right,
jacks or better to open,

06:22.282 --> 06:24.552
you can pull four cards
on an ace, no wild cards,

06:24.585 --> 06:26.554
-just American poker.
-Got it.
-Yep.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.858
All right, I am, uh,
I'm in for a big dime.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.726
-I'm in.
-Uh, all right.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.195
Yep. In.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.265
Ooh, too rich for my blood,
I'll tell you that.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.067
You're out?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.602
I got to watch my money,
you know?

06:41.635 --> 06:43.203
Since my mom's
not driving anymore,

06:43.236 --> 06:44.872
I'm responsible
for getting her around,

06:44.905 --> 06:48.075
and believe me, those senior
bus passes ain't cheap.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.477
All right, let's do it.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.378
-All right. Two cards here.
-Okay.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.780
Your mom stopped driving?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.816
Oh, I told her to.
She hit a neighbor's mailbox.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.918
Made a little mistake,
that's all.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.689
His mailbox is attached
to his front door.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.093
-So...
-All right, meanwhile,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.328
-back to the poker game.
-Oh.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.230
That-that must've been
a really hard thing

07:10.263 --> 07:11.499
for you to tell her, Joe.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.166
-Yeah, yeah, I guess.
-Uh, two cards.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.470
-How'd she react?
-Oh, mad as hell.
She threw her teeth at me.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.673
Okay. Two cards here.
Two cards.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.810
It's important to remember, this
isn't just happening to you.

07:22.843 --> 07:26.446
You see? Losing independence
is the greatest fear of aging.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.315
Yeah, I went through that
with my dad. It was rough.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.750
You know what's rough?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.019
It's playing cards
with Oprah's audience. Okay?

07:32.052 --> 07:33.420
Two cards?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.589
Mike, Joe's talking
about something

07:35.623 --> 07:38.425
that is really important to him.
We have all night to play cards.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.662
But at some point,
we actually have to play cards.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.363
One.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.932
Ed, it's on you.
How many cards?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.801
Okay, uh...

07:47.835 --> 07:50.938
you know, the secret
is to make sure that she knows

07:50.971 --> 07:52.540
you understand
what she's going through.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.875
-Mm. Wow.
-Hmm?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.710
That is a beautiful statement.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.846
Talk more about that, Ed.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.849
For the love of God!

08:01.882 --> 08:03.551
Okay, okay, okay,
I see that Mike's in a rush

08:03.584 --> 08:05.218
to clean us out tonight.
All right, three cards, please.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.386
-MIKE: Good, good, good, good.
-Three cards.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.988
All right. Chuck?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.990
-Okay. I'm thinking,
I'm thinking.
-No, go ahead.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.492
-Come on.
-I'm thinking
the only thing worse

08:12.526 --> 08:14.995
than dealing with an aging
parent is dealing with a kid.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.798
-Yeah.
-Oh. Something going on
with Brandon?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.867
-Oh, man, let me...
-Listen, when we play poker,

08:19.900 --> 08:22.670
we actually have to play poker!

08:22.703 --> 08:25.172
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe this isn't the right place

08:25.205 --> 08:27.040
-for me to talk about it.
-Or you know what?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.341
-Maybe it is. I fold.
-MIKE: No.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.043
-No. No. No.
-Yeah, me, too.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.812
-Yeah, I'm gonna fold, too.
-No, no, no, no, no!
-Go on.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.213
-You know what?
-No, no, no, no!

08:33.246 --> 08:34.982
-I got four kings!
-My wife called this girl

08:35.015 --> 08:36.717
-the disaster from Duluth, mm.
-You can't...

08:36.750 --> 08:38.619
Man, she is just the...

08:44.191 --> 08:46.226
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.161
Hey, I want to show you
something I picked up

08:48.195 --> 08:49.396
on my last hunting trip.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.131
(chuckles) Litter!

08:53.133 --> 08:56.737
The footprint of
the Rocky Mountain jackass.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.740
I mean, what kind of sociopath
walks into a pristine forest

08:59.773 --> 09:04.411
and says, "You know what
this place needs? My garbage."

09:04.444 --> 09:08.281
It's the woods, dummy!
Not a movie theater.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.950
Look, I could solve this problem

09:09.983 --> 09:12.886
with a simple two-week
bowhunting season on litterers.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.622
But my state legislator

09:14.655 --> 09:17.625
won't even bring the bill
to the floor.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.560
Government.

09:20.594 --> 09:24.064
Maybe paintballs. That would
humiliate the litterers,

09:24.097 --> 09:25.866
and they're biodegradable.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.534
Now, maybe you're thinking,

09:27.567 --> 09:30.370
"What's one beer can
in 100,000 acres?"

09:30.403 --> 09:31.905
Well, the next guy might say,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.107
"Oh, I guess this is
where we dump our trash."

09:34.141 --> 09:36.043
He adds a potato chip bag
to the mix,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.745
and then some
candy bar wrappers.

09:37.778 --> 09:41.281
Next thing you know, your
perfect landscape is a landfill.

09:41.314 --> 09:45.152
And Iron Eyes Cody has a single
tear rolling down his cheek.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.991
I go into the woods
to escape the real world.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.560
Last thing I wanted to see
is a bunch of real world

09:53.593 --> 09:56.429
scattered at the base
of the tree.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.598
You know, I think of
a good poker game

09:58.632 --> 10:00.934
a little like
the state of nature. Huh?

10:00.968 --> 10:03.303
An untarnished environment
that gets ruined

10:03.336 --> 10:06.974
when people start littering it
with their emotional debris.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.811
You know, it's all like tossing
your dog's crap into my yard.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.345
It hasn't gone away.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.015
The crap is just in my yard
instead of yours.

10:15.048 --> 10:19.186
And I don't want to clean up
after you or your stupid dog.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.021
And the next time
you're thinking about

10:21.054 --> 10:23.423
desecrating my woods
with your trash,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.625
you might want to take
a good look around,

10:25.659 --> 10:28.762
make sure I'm not hiding
behind a tree.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.665
I'm really good at hiding.
(chuckles)

10:33.667 --> 10:35.736
Baxter out.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.507
So, I think you should
change into it at school

10:40.540 --> 10:42.676
right before you ask him.
That way, it'll be a surprise.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.878
Do you have any experience
walking in slow motion?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.554
(vocalizing)

10:54.587 --> 10:56.323
Not really.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.325
I'll teach you. (laughs)

10:58.358 --> 11:00.894
So, uh, how well do you know
this Adam St. Cloud?

11:00.928 --> 11:04.031
Uh, I got my hair caught
on his backpack once.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.134
Okay, not a problem.
Um, how are you gonna ask him?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.636
I don't know. I haven't
even thought about it.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.505
Well, luckily, I'm smart enough
to think for the both of us.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.341
Come on.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.643
Kyle, you have to be
Adam St. Cloud.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.078
Piece of cake.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.049
Who's that?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.884
Uh, Jen's asking him to prom.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.753
So, Jen, where's
the best place to ask him?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.520
-Probably the cafeteria.
-Great.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.889
Kyle, you are in the cafeteria.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.491
Oh, right.
(clears throat)

11:31.524 --> 11:34.527
Hey, Ronnie,
give me some tacos, yo.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.564
It's taco day.

11:37.597 --> 11:41.568
No. He's more confident.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.071
And cool.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.874
And his hair's always messy.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.576
But not too messy.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.679
And he knows everyone.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.048
And everyone knows him.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.686
Jen, he sounds pretty popular.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.622
He's so popular.
He's captain of the swim team.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.091
And he plays guitar.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.959
And he was homecoming king.

12:07.761 --> 12:11.064
Are you sure this
is the right guy to ask?

12:11.098 --> 12:12.565
Of course I am.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.934
(chuckles)

12:13.967 --> 12:16.636
I sound perfect.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.606
All right.
Aim high! I love it.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.942
Um, okay. There he is.
Go ask him.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.577
Be direct, but playful.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.446
-Got it. (exhales)
-Mm-hmm.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.461
(clears throat)
Hey, Jen.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.831
Hi, Adam.
(gags)

12:46.499 --> 12:48.601
The prom is...
(gags)

12:50.370 --> 12:52.973
What the hell is that?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.942
When I get really nervous,

12:54.975 --> 12:57.144
it kind of triggers
my gag reflex.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.948
Okay.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.016
Um... take a breath.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.985
-(exhales sharply)
-Okay.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.386
-Let me start over.
-Mm-hmm.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.522
Hi, Adam...
(gags)

13:15.462 --> 13:18.365
I guess I could...
make a matching bib.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.371
-Hey, Mike.
-Hey.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.839
Hey, Baxter, you wanted
to see us?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.340
Yeah.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.276
I like coming up here.
It's nice to get away

13:29.309 --> 13:31.678
-from all those garage fumes.
-Right.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.381
I like coming up here.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.419
It's nice to get away
from all those garage fumes.

13:40.888 --> 13:44.457
Okay, we got to vent
that garage, all right?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.293
Uh, look,
I asked you guys up here

13:46.326 --> 13:47.827
to talk about the card game.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.997
I think we all agree
that having Ryan there

13:50.030 --> 13:51.899
kind of screwed things up
with all the chitchat.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.067
Well, he got us talking
about our problems.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.835
What's the big deal?

13:55.869 --> 14:00.974
'Cause we talked and talked
and the cards just sat and sat.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.709
And we listened.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.578
I did some good active listening
in that game.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.747
Yeah, but we didn't
play any cards.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.484
So, instead of Ryan,
I say we invite Steve.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.720
He's still grieving for his mom,

14:13.753 --> 14:15.288
so easy money.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.358
Oh, I don't know, Baxter.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.728
Ryan was the only one
who noticed the dash of cinnamon

14:21.761 --> 14:24.932
I put in my homemade
poker cookies.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.833
I'm not gonna lie.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.336
It felt nice.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.737
(stammers)
Ed, wha-what do you think?

14:30.770 --> 14:33.273
I thought it was nutmeg.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.944
Are you kidd...

14:36.977 --> 14:38.912
I'm not talking about
the stupid cookies,

14:38.946 --> 14:41.448
I'm talking about putting poker
back in our poker game.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.050
You know, if you got
a problem with Ryan,

14:43.083 --> 14:44.384
you should bring it up
at the next game.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.718
It's a safe space.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.755
Ordinarily, I'd be
right with you, Mike,

14:48.788 --> 14:51.224
but... the kid does bring
something special.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.026
Yeah, he's like
the dash of cinnamon

14:53.060 --> 14:55.428
-in our new recipe.
-Yeah.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.098
So you guys don't find him
annoying at all?

14:58.131 --> 15:00.400
No, I found
the discussion cathartic.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.469
Which is a new word
our friend Ryan taught us.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.405
Yeah. (scoffs)
I don't know, Baxter.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.375
-You leave the game with
something to think about.
-Mm.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.477
So, this is really the way
you want to play cards,

15:10.510 --> 15:11.711
all you guys?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.380
So maybe...
(chuckles)

15:13.413 --> 15:15.048
maybe I should do something else
on Thursday night,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.284
like, oh, play with my cars,
you know?

15:17.317 --> 15:20.053
'Cause cars don't just sit there
and tell me their problems.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.554
(chuckles)

15:21.588 --> 15:23.490
Well, that's really big
of you, Mike.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.125
-That'd be great.
-Yeah, man, thanks.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.493
Yeah, thanks.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.068
-RYAN: Hey.
-MIKE: Hi, there.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.137
So, I was thinking about
opening up

15:37.170 --> 15:39.472
a little lounge in the pot shop

15:39.506 --> 15:42.309
and maybe I could host
the poker game there sometime.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.977
Oh, great idea.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.146
Joe inside of a pot shop.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.049
The guy can barely remember
the cards he has now.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.420
Heck, you guys play cards
wherever you want to play cards.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.123
Okay. What does that mean?

15:56.156 --> 15:58.591
That card game the other night
just wasn't my thing, you know?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.427
I'm just not into people
hashing out their problems

16:00.460 --> 16:01.761
where I'm playing poker.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.132
You know, normal humans
actually like having an outlet.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.667
Well, I don't like
normal humans.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.638
Every day at Outdoor Man,
I'm the man

16:11.671 --> 16:12.972
that everybody brings
their problems to.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.474
Yeah, same. I get asked

16:14.507 --> 16:16.343
a thousand questions a day
at the pot shop.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.844
I mean, granted,
half of them are,

16:17.877 --> 16:20.647
"Uh, dude, did I already
ask you that?"

16:20.680 --> 16:23.050
-So, you get it.
-Yeah, I get it.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.018
But I don't let it get to me
because I meditate.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.619
I have this little room
that I go to

16:26.653 --> 16:28.821
which I'm definitely not
gonna tell you about

16:28.855 --> 16:30.657
because you will
fill it with bees.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.460
Well, I meditate, too.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.396
Every Thursday,
with cards in my hand.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.398
Poker is your escape?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.967
All week long people are
bringing their problems to me,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.203
so for three hours,
while I'm playing poker,

16:43.236 --> 16:45.572
I can shut out the worry,
the questions

16:45.605 --> 16:49.242
and I get to... recharge.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.677
And us talking about
our problems

16:50.710 --> 16:52.011
makes that impossible.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.846
Impossible and annoying.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.648
It's like having vegans
over for dinner.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.318
I mean, what are we gonna eat?
The-the placemats?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.488
Damn it, I hate when
I empathize with you.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.022
But I do.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.158
So, what would you do
for meditation

17:05.192 --> 17:06.693
if you couldn't play poker?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.228
I'm thinking of raising bees.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.231
Actually, you know what?

17:11.264 --> 17:13.466
You solve people's problems
all day. Let me take this one.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.606
All right, let's stay positive.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.242
You did everything you could,
maybe it all worked out.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.777
Yeah, sure, Mom.
Maybe she asked him

17:24.811 --> 17:26.546
and Adam said,
(gagging): "Yes."

17:26.579 --> 17:28.148
Oh...

17:30.049 --> 17:31.851
Hi, guys.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.487
And that's how you do
quantum physics.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.692
Any questions?

17:39.726 --> 17:42.395
Yep, that's how I always do it.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.433
Uh, so, uh, so-so,
how did it go with Adam?

17:46.466 --> 17:47.900
Terrible.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.936
I walked right up to him
just like we practiced

17:49.969 --> 17:52.105
and then I started, you know.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.373
-Aw.
-Well, you know,

17:53.406 --> 17:55.575
personally, I think it's cute.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.414
I never even got to ask him
because...

18:01.448 --> 18:03.650
-Oh, my gosh.
-...he asked me!

18:03.683 --> 18:05.952
-What? Oh! Wow!
-(squealing)

18:05.985 --> 18:09.088
-(Jen laughing)
-Shut up!

18:09.122 --> 18:11.658
Oh, are you serious?

18:11.691 --> 18:15.128
(giggling) He said he was
trying to ask me all week

18:15.162 --> 18:17.096
but he was too nervous.

18:17.130 --> 18:20.066
Me. I made him nervous.
(giggles)

18:20.099 --> 18:22.101
-(chuckles)
-Kyle, are you okay?

18:22.135 --> 18:24.171
Yeah, I'm just so happy
we're learning the foxtrot

18:24.204 --> 18:25.672
because we're gonna be

18:25.705 --> 18:27.106
(voice breaking):
dancing at your wedding.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.977
Thank you guys so much.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.846
And Mandy, I got so many
compliments on my outfit.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.482
Wow, you're going to the prom.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.350
I-I can't wait to take pictures.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.951
Get in line, sister.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.021
Now the real work begins.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.491
You need to look spectacular
because everyone is gonna

18:44.524 --> 18:46.025
-be looking at Adam and you.
-(chuckles)

18:46.058 --> 18:47.827
-Everyone?
-Oh, wouldn't it be great

18:47.860 --> 18:50.630
-if she was named prom queen?
-Prom queen? (gags)

18:50.663 --> 18:52.265
(yelps)

18:52.299 --> 18:54.967
(gagging)

18:58.971 --> 19:00.807
How can you think that's cute?

19:05.011 --> 19:06.346
My mom's not
taking the bus anymore.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.614
Now I'm driving her around.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.650
See? Guys?
Joe turned a difficult situation

19:10.683 --> 19:12.219
into a wonderful opportunity.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.521
But you don't want
your mother on the bus, Joe.

19:14.554 --> 19:18.191
Those things are packed
with ne'er-do-wells.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.159
Yeah, we spend
a lot of time in the car

19:20.193 --> 19:21.728
and I'm learning
a lot about her.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.130
-ED: Mm-hmm?
-For instance,
she's a great tipper.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.532
Hmm.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.235
You guys know I drive
for Uber, right?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.738
Oh, all right.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.373
And Chuck?
Last time we all talked,

19:33.406 --> 19:34.841
you were worried about Brandon.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.009
Oh, well, not so much anymore.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.845
You know, I stopped hovering

19:38.878 --> 19:41.047
and he figured it out
all on his own.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.016
The girl he was dating
was a train wreck.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.086
Train's another place
crawling with layabouts.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.659
Speaking of layabouts,
I'm gonna lay about seven cards

19:52.692 --> 19:55.928
that you will not like.
Uh, gin, uh, rummy.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.064
-Mm-hmm, all right.
-Hey, guys.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.233
Oh, there he is, right on time.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.901
-All right.
-All right, gin rummy is done.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.370
-Hi, Mike.
-Let the poker begin.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.737
-Let the games begin.
-Yeah.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.839
-Let's go.
-All right.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.441
Hey, I didn't tell you guys.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.943
I met a new girl at the deli,
I think I like her.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.279
Oh, are you gonna ask her out?

20:12.312 --> 20:13.746
I don't think so.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.383
You know?
I'm just a number to her.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.051
RYAN:
Joe.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.287
Remember the rules, okay?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.221
We only talk about our problems
during gin rummy.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.923
8:00 is poker time

20:23.956 --> 20:26.693
and we only talk about one thing
and that is poker.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.395
MIKE:
Now let's be clear, you can talk

20:28.428 --> 20:30.397
about whatever you want, just
as long as it's meaningless.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.800
Uh, Mike, you're up.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.235
I'm open for a big fat...

20:36.269 --> 20:38.638
-ten cents.
-All right, I'm in. I'm in.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.807
-I should fold...
-ED: Mm-hmm?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.209
...but I'm not gonna.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.243
-I'm in.
-Oh, yeah, I'm in.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.686
The bet is to you, Baxter.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.825
I think you're bluffing.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.394
(scoffs) There's only one way
to find out,

21:01.428 --> 21:04.230
Mr. Big Shot.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.132
This is amazing.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.767
Hmm.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.304
I've never seen Joe
in a poker game till the end.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.839
Yeah, when Mike bets like this,

21:12.872 --> 21:15.141
-he usually has
a full house or better.
-Yeah.

21:15.174 --> 21:18.144
All right, I'm all in.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.479
I call. What do you got?

21:19.512 --> 21:21.314
Read 'em and weep.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.716
Gin rummy.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.660
It's the fumes
in the garage, isn't it?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.265
(chicken clucks)

21:39.298 --> 21:41.300
