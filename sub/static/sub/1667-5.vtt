Our father.
I saw him.

00:17.694 --> 00:20.696
He was enslaved with some
spell cast by Davina.

do that, are you,

probably get going, Nik.

13:48.185 --> 13:51.190
To hunt down your
pet serial killer friend.

13:51.191 --> 13:52.658
Listen. Not to be
Mr. judgmental here,

13:52.659 --> 13:55.861
but I'm starting to question
the company that you keep.

13:55.862 --> 13:57.596
The white oak stake?

13:57.597 --> 13:59.664
It's gone, I'm afraid.

13:59.666 --> 14:03.200
The serial killer one took it.

14:04.504 --> 14:08.342
Mikael? Mikael.
Mikael.

14:08.343 --> 14:10.645
Why isn't this working?

14:10.646 --> 14:13.179
Sit... sit down, all right?

14:13.180 --> 14:14.947
You were out for
quite a long time.

14:14.948 --> 14:16.215
Maybe that's got
something to do with it.

14:16.216 --> 14:17.516
Here. Have some water.
No.

14:17.517 --> 14:18.650
You don't understand.

14:18.651 --> 14:20.485
If Mikael is free,
he can kill Klaus,

14:20.486 --> 14:23.121
and then my friends die, too.

14:23.122 --> 14:25.221
Well, if I understand all
this, Mikael has been trying

14:25.222 --> 14:26.555
to kill Klaus for eons.

14:26.556 --> 14:28.758
How are you gonna stop him?

14:28.759 --> 14:31.194
I'm not.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.898
I need to finish my spell now.

14:36.666 --> 14:38.135
[Hayley clears throat]

14:38.136 --> 14:39.839
So those werewolf kids
you helped get

14:39.840 --> 14:43.343
out of the quarter made it
to the safe house up north.

14:43.344 --> 14:45.410
Great. My good deed
for the decade.

14:45.411 --> 14:46.742
No. I'm good.

14:46.744 --> 14:48.345
Maybe the vampires
and us free wolves

14:48.346 --> 14:50.046
can work together, after all.

14:50.048 --> 14:52.718
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.623
Anyway, thanks for helping.

14:56.624 --> 15:00.594
Mm. Don't thank me.
Thank Elijah.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.429
I would've, but I can't
get a hold of him.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.364
I went to the compound
thinking he'd be there.

15:04.365 --> 15:07.134
Really? I thought you
always had tabs on him.

15:07.135 --> 15:11.137
We haven't really been on
the best terms lately.

15:11.138 --> 15:12.937
He wouldn't just
disappear, though.

15:12.938 --> 15:15.774
Last I knew, he was gonna
keep the wolves distracted.

15:15.775 --> 15:18.211
Your boy Oliver
was gonna help him.

15:18.212 --> 15:20.080
I couldn't track down
Oliver either.

15:21.417 --> 15:24.115
If they're both missing...

15:26.788 --> 15:28.223
Where are you going?

15:28.224 --> 15:29.593
To find them.

15:29.594 --> 15:31.994
Not on your own, you're not.

15:36.031 --> 15:38.434
Lenore: You're hungry,
aren't you?

15:38.435 --> 15:40.503
It's been hours since you fed.

15:40.504 --> 15:43.805
What an awful thing, to feed
upon the blood of others.

15:43.806 --> 15:47.209
For this I blame myself
and your father.

15:47.210 --> 15:50.077
We tried to make
you children strong,

15:50.078 --> 15:52.847
but instead we cursed you all.

15:52.848 --> 15:55.182
[Birds calling]

16:12.266 --> 16:13.833
Brother?

16:27.277 --> 16:30.055
What am I?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.555
How many...?

16:31.556 --> 16:33.255
Six.

16:33.256 --> 16:35.187
You slaughtered 6
villagers, brother.

16:35.189 --> 16:38.227
You tore them apart as if
they were nothing at all.

16:38.228 --> 16:40.231
[Stammers]

16:42.668 --> 16:44.168
Brother...

16:45.303 --> 16:47.005
What have I become?

16:47.007 --> 16:50.311
You seem like the wolves
in the village.

16:50.312 --> 16:53.714
Cursed to turn
when the moon is full.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.414
Listen to me.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.088
Father is beside
himself with rage.

17:01.089 --> 17:02.858
It seems this...

17:02.859 --> 17:05.491
Affliction can only be passed

17:05.492 --> 17:09.030
by some kind of conception.

17:09.031 --> 17:11.666
And do our siblings
share this affliction?

17:11.667 --> 17:13.102
Do you...

17:13.104 --> 17:15.403
Share this affliction?

17:17.906 --> 17:20.578
No...

17:20.579 --> 17:23.182
I don't.

17:23.183 --> 17:25.752
He is not my father, is he?

17:27.123 --> 17:29.356
You listen to me.

17:29.357 --> 17:32.692
This changes nothing
for any of us.

17:32.693 --> 17:36.896
We are here for you as we
shall be always, mm-hmm?

17:47.357 --> 17:49.539
Tatia. Tatia!

17:49.540 --> 17:51.675
I fail to see your point here.

17:51.676 --> 17:54.443
I compelled Tatia to forget
what she saw, and she did.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.643
You'd only been a vampire
for a few days.

17:56.644 --> 17:59.011
You hadn't yet learned
compulsion.

17:59.012 --> 18:01.348
No...

18:01.349 --> 18:03.786
I remember that clearly.

18:03.788 --> 18:05.222
Do you?

18:05.223 --> 18:08.356
You still thought there were
lines you wouldn't cross,

18:08.357 --> 18:12.123
people you wouldn't hurt,
things you wouldn't do.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.994
But you were wrong.

18:13.996 --> 18:16.833
That is what I'm here
to show you.

18:16.835 --> 18:17.834
[Rapid footsteps]

18:17.835 --> 18:18.901
Elijah: Tatia!

18:18.902 --> 18:20.936
Tatia! Tatia!

18:20.937 --> 18:23.168
Wait! Wait.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.472
Stay away from me.

18:25.473 --> 18:26.506
I won't hurt you.

18:26.508 --> 18:27.808
What have you become?

18:27.809 --> 18:29.143
I am who I've always been.

18:29.144 --> 18:30.545
I'm the one who loves you.

18:30.546 --> 18:32.745
Lenore: You knew how
special she was.

18:32.746 --> 18:34.778
I always thought you
would protect her,

18:34.780 --> 18:36.281
that she would be your wife,

18:36.282 --> 18:38.082
that one day I might
call her daughter.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.249
Instead...

18:39.250 --> 18:40.919
I didn't hurt her.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.790
You've taught yourself
to hide from who

18:42.791 --> 18:45.260
and what you are for
thousands of years.

18:45.261 --> 18:47.594
No.

18:47.595 --> 18:50.360
I did not hurt Tatia.

18:50.362 --> 18:51.699
I could not.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.134
But you did.

18:53.135 --> 18:54.902
Your mother asked for my blood.

18:54.903 --> 18:56.768
She said nothing of
the dark magic

18:56.769 --> 18:58.935
that would turn you
into a monster.

18:58.936 --> 19:00.635
Look at me.

19:00.636 --> 19:03.038
I am not a monst...

19:10.783 --> 19:14.319
Oh, my beautiful
boy, no more hiding.

19:14.321 --> 19:18.354
It is time now for you
to remember it all.

19:18.355 --> 19:19.719
Tatia: No! No!

19:21.056 --> 19:23.996
I said I wouldn't hunt you.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.695
And I don't want t...

19:28.464 --> 19:29.697
Elijah.

19:29.698 --> 19:31.132
Run.

19:32.904 --> 19:34.474
You didn't want to hurt her.

19:34.475 --> 19:35.742
You loved her.

19:35.743 --> 19:37.742
No! Ugh!

19:37.743 --> 19:39.343
Lenore: But you couldn't
fight what you had become,

19:39.344 --> 19:41.009
what I had turned you into...

19:41.010 --> 19:43.042
[Tatia gasping]

19:43.044 --> 19:45.512
A predator...

19:45.514 --> 19:49.048
And she became your prey.

19:51.749 --> 19:54.184
This was you.

19:54.186 --> 19:55.990
You murdered her
for her blood...

19:55.991 --> 19:59.727
And then used it to cripple
Klaus for centuries.

20:02.598 --> 20:04.834
I won't listen to another word.

20:04.835 --> 20:06.667
You don't have to listen, son.

20:07.834 --> 20:11.771
All you have to do is remember.

20:51.473 --> 20:54.503
Did you honestly think
to hold me

20:54.505 --> 20:56.238
with a blade forged for pain?

20:56.240 --> 21:00.581
Unlike the weak, unlike you,
I gain strength from pain.

21:00.582 --> 21:02.550
Soon you will know
the taste of white oak

21:02.551 --> 21:04.118
as it pierces your heart.

21:04.119 --> 21:06.053
Very clever, Mikael.

21:06.055 --> 21:09.993
Compelling the locals to say
to my face what you dare not.

21:12.332 --> 21:14.799
Enjoy the theatrics.

21:14.801 --> 21:16.834
They only delay the inevitable.

21:16.836 --> 21:18.103
[Yells]

21:21.743 --> 21:25.309
Well, perhaps we should
hold off on this.

21:26.444 --> 21:28.047
No. I hai everything I need.

21:28.048 --> 21:30.788
Combine a knotting spell
with a sire bond spell.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.655
I just have to combine
them the right way.

21:32.656 --> 21:33.990
Then do them in reverse.

21:33.991 --> 21:37.462
That's pretty advanced
for a wee girl like you.

21:38.498 --> 21:42.170
I can give you a list of people
who have underestimated me.

21:42.172 --> 21:43.974
Not one of them has
done it a second time.

21:43.975 --> 21:45.810
Well, perhaps I should help you.

21:45.811 --> 21:47.612
I'm pretty good at
stuff like this.

21:48.848 --> 21:50.183
I don't think so.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.654
It's not just saying
spells backwards.

21:52.655 --> 21:54.986
It's changing the verb
tense into...

21:54.987 --> 21:56.954
Nemo unus animabus

21:56.955 --> 22:00.191
carnem et sanguinem de ista duo.

22:01.729 --> 22:05.403
Like I said, I'm pretty.

22:05.404 --> 22:08.170
It's never paid to
underestimate me either.

22:09.439 --> 22:11.677
Ok. Let's do this.

22:18.983 --> 22:20.854
Cami: I used to
try to convince Klaus

22:20.855 --> 22:22.290
that there was good in everyone,

22:22.291 --> 22:23.727
that you really did
care about him...

22:23.728 --> 22:25.927
Deep inside once.

22:27.928 --> 22:32.464
He told me I was naive,
that I could never fathom

22:32.465 --> 22:34.937
how deep your hatred ran.

22:34.938 --> 22:37.006
I didn't always hate him.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.040
When Niklaus was born,
I was overjoyed.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.841
I thought, this one...

22:40.842 --> 22:42.945
This one has the eyes
of a warrior.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.649
He will be worthy.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.550
But my hope was short-lived.

22:46.551 --> 22:49.017
And when I found out that
he wasn't really my son,

22:49.018 --> 22:52.051
my relief was glorious!

22:52.052 --> 22:53.754
But that passed

22:53.755 --> 22:56.258
with the knowledge that
he was begat of a beast.

22:56.259 --> 22:58.527
His mother's infidelity
was not his fault.

22:58.528 --> 23:00.095
Everything that followed

23:00.096 --> 23:03.298
was because of Niklaus'
obsession with the wolves.

23:03.299 --> 23:06.268
He ventured out to watch them
turn under the full moon,

23:06.269 --> 23:09.038
and he took my youngest
son, Heinrich.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.775
He was but a child.

23:10.776 --> 23:13.245
And he was torn apart.

23:13.246 --> 23:14.445
An accident.

23:14.446 --> 23:18.380
An accident?!
He murdered my wife!

23:18.381 --> 23:21.083
His own mother who
sought to cleanse him

23:21.084 --> 23:23.152
of his beast-like nature.

23:23.153 --> 23:26.290
He betrayed me.

23:26.291 --> 23:30.563
He turned my entire
family against me.

23:30.564 --> 23:33.568
And yet you defend him.

23:36.136 --> 23:39.572
I have desperately
tried to convince him

23:39.573 --> 23:42.278
not to kill you, that
the bloodshed

23:42.279 --> 23:45.413
in your family does not have
to be an endless cycle.

23:45.415 --> 23:48.549
And after centuries on this
earth, do you really not see

23:48.550 --> 23:52.151
that all of your
violence is pointless?

23:53.119 --> 23:54.785
[Laughing]

23:55.854 --> 23:57.892
Let me hazard a guess.

23:57.893 --> 24:00.695
You are one of these
alienists, right?

24:02.331 --> 24:03.965
We're called therapists
these days.

24:03.966 --> 24:06.803
And to be honest, you could
do with some couch time.

24:06.804 --> 24:09.773
Actually, my dear,
since my wound

24:09.774 --> 24:12.075
does not appear to be healing,

24:12.076 --> 24:16.214
what I could do with
right now is some food.

24:16.215 --> 24:18.217
You... you said you wouldn't.

24:18.218 --> 24:20.320
Yes, I did, didn't I?

24:20.321 --> 24:22.192
And all of the blood of
a fawn barely makes

24:22.193 --> 24:24.596
for good fodder.

What is it, Hayley?

24:45.042 --> 24:46.643
Something has
happened to Elijah.

24:46.644 --> 24:48.478
He was supposed to be
our decoy last night,

24:48.479 --> 24:50.177
and now he's vanished.

24:50.179 --> 24:52.010
There's blood everywhere...

24:52.011 --> 24:54.247
Werewolf and vampire.

24:54.248 --> 24:55.449
There is a trail.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.119
I need you to help us track it.

Well, as much as I might
like to help you find

my brother, I have more
pressing matters at the moment.

What's more important
than your own brother...

25:05.027 --> 25:06.360

25:06.362 --> 25:08.196
Davina had Mikael on
a magical leash.

25:08.197 --> 25:09.863
And it broke.

25:09.864 --> 25:13.001
Now Mikael has Tunde's
blade, the white oak stake,

25:13.002 --> 25:14.270
and Cami.

25:14.271 --> 25:16.172
I'm going to get her back.

25:17.273 --> 25:19.407
And then I'm going to end this.

25:19.408 --> 25:22.240
Either Mikael or I will be
ash by night's end.

25:22.242 --> 25:23.810
And if you do find my brother,

25:23.811 --> 25:25.379
please tell him I
could do with a hand.

just doing it wrong.

No. We have to get this right.

25:51.821 --> 25:54.922
Josh, Marcel, their
lives depend on it.

25:54.923 --> 25:56.190
Look, just stop chanting.

25:56.191 --> 25:58.360
I'll chant and channel
your power.

26:04.768 --> 26:05.766
Release me!

26:05.768 --> 26:07.902
[Kaleb chanting]

26:07.903 --> 26:11.738
I've been wondering when you
might make an appearance, Kol.

26:14.405 --> 26:16.038
You're one of them.

26:19.307 --> 26:20.939
You liar!

26:25.140 --> 26:26.141
[Gasps]

26:26.142 --> 26:27.975
That hurt.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.281
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

26:32.283 --> 26:33.715
You ruined a spell.

26:33.716 --> 26:35.049
And now my friends are
gonna die because of you.

26:35.050 --> 26:38.250
My mother said, kill
the spell or kill her.

26:38.251 --> 26:40.085
And I happen to like you.

26:40.087 --> 26:41.822
Oh, please.

26:41.823 --> 26:43.057
Listen, you don't disobey
mother dearest

26:43.058 --> 26:44.793
without some consequences.

26:44.794 --> 26:46.661
Yes, she brought
me back to life.

26:46.663 --> 26:48.330
But she's mad as a hatter.

26:48.331 --> 26:50.933
And that man you've made
your pet, my father,

26:50.934 --> 26:53.235
well, he's more of
a lunatic than she is.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.804
What, so you just unleash him?

26:54.805 --> 26:56.238
You're the one who brought
him back to life first.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.639
I had him under control.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.207
Yeah, right up until
the point you didn't,

26:59.208 --> 27:01.076
which is when he threatened me.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.944
He wanted freedom,
so I freed him.

27:02.945 --> 27:04.311
You want to know my secrets?

27:04.313 --> 27:06.680
Then here you go. Go on.
Have at it.

27:06.682 --> 27:08.282
Yes, I'm a Mikaelson.

27:08.283 --> 27:10.118
But I've got just as much
reason to loathe

27:10.119 --> 27:11.685
the lot of them as you do.

27:15.626 --> 27:18.529
You deactivated
my bracelet. How?

27:18.530 --> 27:20.130
It's a dark object.

27:20.132 --> 27:21.833
I know a little something
about creating

27:21.834 --> 27:23.068
and destroying them.

27:23.069 --> 27:25.205
Show me.

27:25.206 --> 27:26.941
All right.

27:29.177 --> 27:31.077
You're distorting my memories.

27:31.078 --> 27:33.278
It was you who killed Tatia.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.282
Oh. I used her blood
to bind the spell

27:36.283 --> 27:39.249
that suppressed Niklaus'
werewolf aspect.

27:39.250 --> 27:42.649
But by the time you
brought her to me,

27:42.651 --> 27:44.253
she was already dead.

27:44.254 --> 27:46.659
You can't rewrite history.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.860
No. I cannot.

27:48.862 --> 27:50.898
And I did not...

27:50.899 --> 27:54.103
Not until I had your consent.

27:57.473 --> 28:00.075
Lenore: When you became
yourself again,

28:00.077 --> 28:03.916
you brought her to me
but too late.

28:03.917 --> 28:06.287
I told you that you
were a good son,

28:06.288 --> 28:07.888
to let me take care of it,

28:07.889 --> 28:10.056
that I could help make
it all go away.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.769
And then I said to you,
"you will not suffer

28:21.770 --> 28:24.872
"from this memory or be
tormented from the guilt

28:24.873 --> 28:26.873
"of your misdeed.

28:26.874 --> 28:29.142
"What goes behind that
door shall stay there

28:29.143 --> 28:30.544
and be forgotten."

28:33.015 --> 28:35.284
I told you to clean yourself up,

28:35.286 --> 28:37.254
that if you were clean,
no one would know

28:37.256 --> 28:39.890
what you are or what you'd done.

28:46.264 --> 28:48.266
And you did exactly that...

28:48.267 --> 28:50.168
And more.

28:52.073 --> 28:55.546
You created a place in your
mind to put your victims.

28:55.547 --> 28:58.247
You began to believe
that as long as your

28:58.249 --> 29:01.052
suit was immaculate
and your hands clean,

29:01.053 --> 29:05.958
you could look in the mirror
and tell yourself it's all ok.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.060
No one need know what's
behind that red door.

29:12.963 --> 29:14.264
[Screams]

29:14.265 --> 29:18.068
But a thousand years
is a long time, Elijah.

29:18.069 --> 29:21.704
And a place meant to hold
one unforgivable sin

29:21.706 --> 29:25.639
is now full to bursting with
your most monstrous deeds.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.341
Stop!

29:27.342 --> 29:28.742
How long before it's your
beloved Hayley's corpse

29:28.743 --> 29:29.943
behind that door?

29:29.944 --> 29:31.077
Stop.

29:31.079 --> 29:35.517
You must be afraid that
loving you will destroy her,

29:35.518 --> 29:38.987
as it destroyed Celeste, Tatia.

29:38.989 --> 29:40.289
Take my offer...

29:40.290 --> 29:41.757
The both of you.

29:41.758 --> 29:45.228
In new bodies, you'll
be alive again.

29:45.229 --> 29:50.434
You could give her a child
to replace the one she lost.

29:51.635 --> 29:54.603
You will not break me.

29:54.605 --> 29:58.441
Oh, you are already
broken, my dear boy,

29:58.442 --> 30:01.780
but not beyond repair.

30:01.782 --> 30:04.749
I am here to fix you.

30:06.152 --> 30:08.989
I am here to fix you all.

30:17.102 --> 30:19.258
Bleeding power from
a dark object is tricky,

30:19.259 --> 30:22.060
so it does help to know
what kind of object it is.

30:22.061 --> 30:23.528
The white oak stake.

30:23.529 --> 30:25.966
You want to drain
the white oak stake, do you?

30:25.967 --> 30:27.302
It's a dark object.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.605
If I can't stop Mikael,
I have to stop

30:28.606 --> 30:29.874
that stake from working.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.410
See, usually I like
a girl with ambition,

30:31.411 --> 30:32.945
but this is just beyond mad.

30:32.946 --> 30:35.414
Just show me the spell,
Kaleb... Kol...

30:35.415 --> 30:37.585
Or whatever your name is.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.787
The problem's not
the spell, love.

30:38.788 --> 30:40.524
The problem's the
white oak stake.

30:40.525 --> 30:41.757
It's too powerful.

30:41.759 --> 30:43.059
We can't just drain it.

30:43.060 --> 30:44.760
The best you can hope
for is to disable it,

30:44.761 --> 30:46.227
but just for a bit.

30:46.229 --> 30:47.830
So do you have
a better solution?

30:47.831 --> 30:49.864
Because I don't have
time to argue.

30:49.866 --> 30:52.200
So show me the spell
and hand me the keys.

30:52.202 --> 30:53.771
Oh, what are you gonna do?

30:53.772 --> 30:55.608
You just gonna drive around
till you bump into them?

30:55.609 --> 30:57.210
You may have messed
with my bracelet,

30:57.212 --> 30:59.451
but I made sure months ago
that I would always be

30:59.452 --> 31:00.719
able to find Mikael.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.353
All right. Fine.
Your funeral.

31:03.355 --> 31:05.056
I'm still not going to allow you

31:05.057 --> 31:07.157
to drive me bloody car, though.

31:29.045 --> 31:31.378
You're gonna pay for
hurting her.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.651
Oh, that's sweet.

31:35.652 --> 31:38.683
The cur whines for its bitch.

31:40.119 --> 31:42.123
I'll make sure to drain
the rest of her

31:42.124 --> 31:46.228
right in front of your
eyes just before you burn.

32:09.885 --> 32:13.260
Davina, wait. We need
to do this together.

32:13.261 --> 32:14.561
I'm strong enough on my own.

32:14.562 --> 32:16.028
No, you're not.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.499
Listen, I know you
don't trust me...

32:17.500 --> 32:20.068
And that's fair enough...
But these are your mates

32:20.069 --> 32:21.335
that we're trying to save here.

32:21.336 --> 32:24.871
The only way that we can do
this is if we work together.

32:24.872 --> 32:26.775
You need to trust me, all right?

32:26.776 --> 32:28.478
Take my hands.

32:28.479 --> 32:31.282
Take my power.
Channel me.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.285
[Mikael grunting]

32:39.887 --> 32:42.454
Klaus: I'm not as weak
as you remember, am I?

32:52.428 --> 32:53.767
[Screaming]

32:53.769 --> 32:55.471
[Chanting]

32:57.276 --> 32:58.277
Cami: No!

32:58.279 --> 32:59.580
Aah!

32:59.581 --> 33:01.247
[Klaus screaming]

33:11.589 --> 33:13.623
[Chanting continues]

33:27.206 --> 33:29.911
Why aren't you burning?!

33:32.113 --> 33:35.281
If you were dead,
you would burn.

33:37.951 --> 33:39.153
Burn!

33:41.390 --> 33:42.622
Kaleb, I can't hold it.

33:42.624 --> 33:43.656
Just trust me.

33:43.658 --> 33:45.157
[Both continue chanting]

33:47.024 --> 33:49.960
Is this your doing,
little witch?

33:49.962 --> 33:51.330
Then you will undo it.

33:51.331 --> 33:53.198
Return the power to the stake.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.766
[Cami breathing heavily]

34:13.188 --> 34:14.556
[Screaming]

34:19.494 --> 34:20.860
Klaus?

34:24.532 --> 34:26.199
Mikael: What do you
think you're doing?

34:26.201 --> 34:28.065
Stay the hell away from us.

34:29.299 --> 34:31.235
Or, I swear to God,
I'll kill you myself.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.635
You have a warrior's heart.

34:32.637 --> 34:35.304
Perhaps I'll keep it
as a souvenir.

34:44.074 --> 34:45.877
Now enough!

34:45.878 --> 34:49.143
This night has been
a long parade of fools.

34:49.146 --> 34:52.014
I'll enjoy killing every
last one of you.

34:55.721 --> 34:57.088
I wouldn't bet on it.

35:09.891 --> 35:13.061
It's over, Mikael.
You're outnumbered.

35:13.062 --> 35:16.036
Are you going to beg
for your miserable life?

35:16.037 --> 35:17.503
[Chuckles]

35:17.504 --> 35:19.671
You think having people
makes you strong?

35:19.672 --> 35:22.105
It proves how weak you are.

35:24.107 --> 35:26.880
Come find me when you
don't have fools, women,

35:26.881 --> 35:29.915
and children fighting
your battles.

35:43.410 --> 35:44.993
Are you ok?

35:44.994 --> 35:46.628
Ah, a bit lightheaded.

35:46.629 --> 35:48.229
It might have something
to do with being knocked

35:48.230 --> 35:50.430
arse over teacup by
dear old dad.

35:50.432 --> 35:52.266
You are lucky to be
alive, young lady.

35:52.267 --> 35:53.868
You want to tell me what
the hell you were thinking?

35:53.870 --> 35:55.404
Can we not do this right now?

35:55.406 --> 35:57.308
Am I gonna embarrass you
in front of your friend?

35:58.743 --> 36:00.477
Who the hell is this guy anyway?

36:00.479 --> 36:02.213
Haven't we got to stop meeting
like this, pal?

36:02.214 --> 36:04.382
Davina: He's my friend.
And he's helping me.

36:04.383 --> 36:05.750
Help you do what,
wage war on Klaus

36:05.751 --> 36:07.319
and help me get killed
in the process?

36:07.320 --> 36:09.886
I just saved Klaus'
life trying to protect you.

36:09.888 --> 36:11.087
Yeah, from a psycho
vampire hunter

36:11.088 --> 36:12.620
that you brought back to life.

36:12.622 --> 36:14.188
Kaleb: All right. Enough!

36:14.189 --> 36:16.590
Well, I think it's enough.

36:16.591 --> 36:19.193
Well, it should be enough.

36:19.194 --> 36:21.797
I mean, we're all friends here,
aren't we?

36:25.001 --> 36:27.503
Just stay here till I get back.

36:29.239 --> 36:30.938
I'll handle Klaus.

36:34.974 --> 36:37.644
We should get out
of here. Trust me.

36:37.645 --> 36:39.576
My brother's not
the forgiving kind.

36:39.578 --> 36:41.410
Even if you did help
out back there,

36:41.412 --> 36:43.478
his hatred of betrayal
far outweighs

36:43.479 --> 36:45.148
his sense of gratitude.

36:45.149 --> 36:46.885
I'm not afraid of him.

36:48.522 --> 36:51.189
You out to get yourself killed?

36:51.191 --> 36:53.261
I'm out to get even with Klaus.

36:53.262 --> 36:54.597
And you're gonna help me.

36:54.598 --> 36:57.270
But, first, you're right.

36:57.271 --> 36:59.373
Let's get out of here.

37:10.559 --> 37:13.660
You pulled the stake
out in the Nick of time.

37:13.661 --> 37:17.300
A moment longer, and I
would have been done for.

37:17.301 --> 37:18.902
It's the least I could do

37:18.903 --> 37:20.303
for telling you not
to kill that bastard

37:20.304 --> 37:22.201
the first chance you had.

37:23.536 --> 37:25.673
Well, he hurt you.

37:25.674 --> 37:28.076
For that alone,
I would kill him.

37:29.813 --> 37:31.946
You know, in a thousand years,

37:31.947 --> 37:34.513
I think it's the first
time I've seen him run.

37:34.514 --> 37:35.749
You're still weak.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.618
Hayley: And he knew
he was outmatched.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.887
We checked the perimeter,
and he's definitely gone.

37:42.557 --> 37:44.325
I appreciate your assistance.

37:44.326 --> 37:46.828
Well, hey. You die, I die.
Just call me selfish.

37:46.830 --> 37:49.699
Yeah. You die, a lot
of people die.

37:51.071 --> 37:54.543
But, Klaus, we have
another problem.

37:54.544 --> 37:57.311
[Music playing]

37:59.581 --> 38:00.917
No more.

38:00.918 --> 38:02.451
I'm afraid we've just begun.

38:02.453 --> 38:05.756
You will hang here remembering.

38:05.757 --> 38:08.760
Every atrocity you've
hidden behind that door

38:08.761 --> 38:10.966
will emerge to haunt you.

38:10.967 --> 38:13.537
And as you grow weaker,
you will be ripped

38:13.538 --> 38:18.236
of your strength,
your will, your hope.

38:18.237 --> 38:23.580
And as you rot here alone, you
will reconsider my offer...

38:23.581 --> 38:27.788
A new life, a way to be
freed of your demons,

38:27.789 --> 38:30.690
a chance at peace.

38:36.662 --> 38:39.567
Hayley: Oh. That's about enough
of that, don't you think?

38:39.569 --> 38:41.236
I would have ripped
her heart out,

38:41.237 --> 38:43.304
but she would have just
body-jumped me.

38:47.712 --> 38:49.516
How do I get these off?

38:49.518 --> 38:51.620
The doll. There.
Break it.

38:51.621 --> 38:54.155
She's using it to bind me.

39:01.197 --> 39:03.234
You need to feed.

39:03.235 --> 39:04.436
I can't.

39:04.437 --> 39:05.907
You're weak.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.342
I can't.

39:09.746 --> 39:10.980
I crave you.

39:10.981 --> 39:15.218
My hunger, it could
overwhelm me.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.358
Look...

39:21.597 --> 39:23.765
I'm not afraid.

39:52.569 --> 39:54.071
What did you do to him?

39:55.472 --> 39:57.105
I let him dream.

39:58.641 --> 40:02.614
That's considerate of you.

40:03.650 --> 40:05.521
I cannot lead him
out of darkness

40:05.522 --> 40:09.359
by simply exposing him
to the horrors of his past.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.798
I have to let him bask
in his own version

40:12.799 --> 40:14.902
of a better world to come.

40:23.008 --> 40:25.476
And by the time he wakes,

40:25.477 --> 40:33.804
he will know the only way
to find peace, is my way.
