Think of what?

12:57.501 --> 12:59.335
Of what happens next.

13:02.272 --> 13:05.608
Of what becomes of us

13:05.709 --> 13:07.810
You, me, Lucrezia.

Where are these
allies, Cesare?

13:16.319 --> 13:17.920
Who are our friends?

13:17.988 --> 13:21.324
I'm not pope.
Neither are you.

13:21.392 --> 13:24.160
Without him,
what becomes of us?

13:24.261 --> 13:26.162
Will he die?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.531
It hangs in
the balance.

13:28.598 --> 13:32.234

which way the balance falls.

18:08.580 --> 18:09.980
No.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.848

18:45.517 --> 18:47.518
You should not refuse.

Your cousin Catherina will

your strength to mine.

27:40.421 --> 27:42.655
They will return when
the pope is well.

27:42.723 --> 27:44.925
Or when he dies.

27:47.128 --> 27:50.097
The window in the washing
room leads outside?

27:52.233 --> 27:54.334
When the family returns,

27:54.402 --> 27:57.537
leave the window
unlatched and walk away.

27:57.605 --> 27:59.740
But you must promise me -

27:59.807 --> 28:02.209
Please, spare the child.
He has done nothing.

28:03.778 --> 28:04.912
Of course.

28:04.979 --> 28:07.114
You have my word.

28:07.215 --> 28:09.015
No harm to the child.

28:17.324 --> 28:18.924
Let's go.

28:44.484 --> 28:46.118

28:51.559 --> 28:53.293
You're certain?

28:53.361 --> 28:54.995
When I left he was
calling for water.

28:55.063 --> 28:56.597
By now he's probably
fucking some servant girl

28:56.665 --> 28:59.200

and a swan's leg in the other.

28:59.301 --> 29:01.035
It's over.

29:01.136 --> 29:02.770
Don't be a fool.

29:02.871 --> 29:05.106
Are you deaf?
He's alive.

29:05.173 --> 29:07.040
So make him die.

29:07.108 --> 29:09.476
The others die
tonight in any case.

29:09.577 --> 29:12.412
I've already given the word.

29:12.514 --> 29:14.848
Dear God.

29:14.916 --> 29:17.584
There's no backing
down now.

29:17.652 --> 29:22.122
Within the month Rome
will have a new pope.

29:22.189 --> 29:24.858
Better for all that it is a
man of moderation and wisdom

29:24.926 --> 29:28.229

with the other?

29:49.720 --> 29:52.054
I told you, preparations
had been made.

29:54.491 --> 29:57.326
In the pope's chamber.

29:57.394 --> 30:01.330
Concealed in the crucifix
upon his offering table.

You know what to do.

Ah...

30:24.155 --> 30:26.890
What say you to that?

30:26.957 --> 30:29.625
Today he lives.

30:29.726 --> 30:31.827
One day he will not.

30:31.895 --> 30:33.696
And on that day,
where will you be?

30:36.733 --> 30:39.768
You do know what
awaits you, hmm?

30:42.805 --> 30:46.341
What we did
to Savonarola

30:46.408 --> 30:48.876
will seem like
the merest whimsy

30:48.944 --> 30:51.446

I will inflict on you.

What I said, I meant.

30:58.921 --> 31:00.889

31:00.957 --> 31:03.158
Where will you be
when he's gone?

31:04.527 --> 31:08.497
They will tear you
down like jackals.

31:08.564 --> 31:09.631
I can help you.

31:09.732 --> 31:10.999
I have no need of your help.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.534
I can pave the way.

31:12.602 --> 31:15.004
Every word from
your lips is a lie.

31:15.071 --> 31:18.541
I'm beaten.
I have failed.

31:18.608 --> 31:20.809
I know that.

31:20.877 --> 31:22.978
What use am I
to you dead?

31:23.079 --> 31:25.080
[snickers]

31:25.148 --> 31:27.415
I do not mean for
you to be dead.

Not for a long, long time.

31:35.057 --> 31:36.457
[knocks on door]

31:45.101 --> 31:46.701

31:49.805 --> 31:51.740
I saw the face of death.

31:51.807 --> 31:54.643
I know.
You said.

31:54.710 --> 31:57.446
And I was afraid.

31:57.513 --> 31:59.748
I am so afraid.

31:59.815 --> 32:01.950
Don't be.

32:02.017 --> 32:03.384
It would take more
than cantarella

32:03.485 --> 32:05.086
to fell an ox like you.

32:05.153 --> 32:07.355
No, you don't understand.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.998
I didn't see
the face of God.

32:21.004 --> 32:22.939
He was not there.

32:25.743 --> 32:28.178
Why did He not
show Himself to me?

32:30.581 --> 32:33.550
But I heard the others.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.386
I heard them.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.922
Colonna.
Versucci.

32:38.989 --> 32:42.759
DeLuca,
Della Rovere.

32:42.860 --> 32:47.297
How they prayed
for my death,

32:47.365 --> 32:49.733
and swore to
see me buried

32:49.801 --> 32:54.405
and never again a Spaniard
on the papal throne.

32:57.810 --> 33:01.413
Carrion crows pecking away.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.750
And where was God
to protect me?

33:05.852 --> 33:07.686
You must rest.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.488
Now close your eyes
and sleep.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.796
[whispers]
He sleeps?

33:17.864 --> 33:21.233
He frets,
as if in fever.

33:21.334 --> 33:23.468
You've done
such work today.

33:23.536 --> 33:26.204
Take mother home.
Stay with her.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.139
Take some sleep
for tomorrow.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.509
I'll stay with him.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.844
Look after him.

the poison took hold

33:59.940 --> 34:02.408

dragged me down.

34:06.045 --> 34:10.147
I heard you
call out to me.

34:10.248 --> 34:14.318
"Father, Father."

34:16.588 --> 34:19.657
And you held me
in your hands.

34:22.092 --> 34:23.694
Come here.
Come.

34:42.683 --> 34:45.619
There was something
before the darkness.

34:49.424 --> 34:54.161
Something you said,
something you told me...

34:56.231 --> 34:59.900
...that the world
must never know.

34:59.968 --> 35:07.175
Your brother's murder
was a terrible crime,

35:09.878 --> 35:15.617
and every crime must be
seen to have a punishment.

35:18.587 --> 35:25.427
So we must find the person
who is to be punished.

35:28.032 --> 35:30.734
You understand?

35:35.507 --> 35:37.241
And I?

your own peace.

46:20.619 --> 46:23.120
The maid's family is dead.

46:23.188 --> 46:25.089
The maid too, I'm sure,
would have been disposed of

46:25.157 --> 46:26.958
had we not
finished her first.

46:27.025 --> 46:31.028
There is someone
thinking far ahead,

46:31.129 --> 46:32.396
tying up loose ends.

46:32.464 --> 46:34.232
Who?

46:34.333 --> 46:35.566
[choir finishes singing]

46:37.603 --> 46:39.937
<i>PRIEST:</i>
<i>Venite exultamus Domino...</i>

46:40.038 --> 46:42.206
<i>[priest continues]</i>

46:43.942 --> 46:46.743
His name is Rufio.

46:46.811 --> 46:51.314
He is a man of my cousin
Catherina Sforza's household.

46:51.381 --> 46:53.983
I have known him
since he was a boy.

46:54.051 --> 46:56.152
He's the most deadly,
the most lethal -

46:56.253 --> 46:57.486
We will find him.

46:57.554 --> 46:59.855
No, no, you will not.

46:59.957 --> 47:02.158
He's not a mere assassin.

47:02.226 --> 47:05.428
He has made himself a
student of the art of death.

47:05.529 --> 47:07.697
You will not find him
unless he wishes it.

47:09.934 --> 47:12.268
And so he
found you.

47:12.336 --> 47:16.139
He came to me and told me
to choose my allegiance.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.708
And you chose Rome.

47:17.776 --> 47:19.577
Yes, of course I chose Rome!

47:19.645 --> 47:21.879
What do you take me for?
A traitor?

47:21.947 --> 47:24.315
Why should I be
surprised at one more...

47:24.382 --> 47:27.517
...when there are so many?

47:27.618 --> 47:29.486
Where is Della Rovere?

47:32.290 --> 47:33.790
Gone.

47:33.858 --> 47:36.259
Who knows where.

47:36.327 --> 47:38.262
He had friends.

47:38.330 --> 47:40.597
Friends within
the Vatican.

47:40.665 --> 47:42.166
I knew nothing
of this.

47:42.233 --> 47:44.435
[scoffs]
I swear it.

47:44.536 --> 47:46.337
I knew nothing
before tonight.

47:49.008 --> 47:51.075
You did well enough.

48:03.522 --> 48:06.157
[birds cawing and chirping]

48:27.214 --> 48:29.816
[gasps]

48:38.325 --> 48:41.093
[bell tolling]
They came for our family?

48:42.162 --> 48:44.163
CESARE: [sighs]
It has passed.

48:44.231 --> 48:45.732
Everyone is well.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.267
Who was it?
Della Rovere?

48:47.368 --> 48:48.635
Perhaps.

48:48.702 --> 48:49.736
[scoffs]
Perhaps!

48:49.837 --> 48:51.404
More likely,

48:51.472 --> 48:54.741
this past night,
your poisoning

48:54.809 --> 48:56.743
has rattled the grass

48:56.811 --> 49:00.180
and all the snakes
in Rome have slid forth.

49:00.247 --> 49:02.349
Della Rovere may not
be the worst of it.

49:02.417 --> 49:03.817
Well, then who?
Who did it?

49:05.019 --> 49:07.521
Catherina Sforza.

49:13.462 --> 49:16.164
That bitch.

49:16.232 --> 49:17.599
[sighs]

49:17.667 --> 49:20.102
And you knew nothing of
this until it was upon us?

49:22.471 --> 49:24.940
Who is to protect
this family,

49:25.041 --> 49:26.741
if not you?

49:28.478 --> 49:29.711
Rodrigo!

49:29.779 --> 49:31.647
You are truly safe!

49:34.717 --> 49:36.184
And little Giovanni?

49:36.252 --> 49:37.985
He's safe.
I told you, Father.

49:38.053 --> 49:39.553
He's safe.
We're all safe.

49:56.438 --> 49:58.373
VANOZZA:
This night is done,

49:58.474 --> 50:00.308
it is daylight.

50:00.409 --> 50:02.276
Open your eyes.

50:02.344 --> 50:03.911
We're not safe.

50:03.979 --> 50:05.480
<i>ALEXANDER:</i>
<i>No.</i>

50:08.984 --> 50:10.818
We are at war.
