(whimpers, crying)

00:04.772 --> 00:05.839
(screams)

00:05.873 --> 00:08.008
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.917
FX presents Mr. InBetween.

00:31.965 --> 00:35.436
So when'd you see him last?
(sniffles)

00:35.469 --> 00:38.239
Last week.

00:41.309 --> 00:44.778
Did he, uh, tell you I got him
a job at the club?

00:44.812 --> 00:46.814
Yeah, he mentioned that.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.255
How are you for money?

00:54.288 --> 00:56.290
Yeah, we're okay.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.728
If you need anything,
just let me know.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.631
-Yeah, we'll be okay,
but thanks.
-Mm.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.867
Jesus.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.303
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.810
I mean...

01:16.844 --> 01:18.846
I haven't mentioned
anything to Maddy yet.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.954
(whispering):
You're not gonna tell her

01:26.987 --> 01:28.822
that he, um... you know?

01:28.856 --> 01:32.560
-She's seven.
-Okay. Mm.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.162
Fair enough.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.964
I'll just
say it was an accident.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.832
Mm-hmm.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.934
Aye.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.607
What a fucking dickhead.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.419
(humming a tune)

01:58.452 --> 02:00.921
-All right.
-What you want to see?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.656
Uh, what do you guys
want to see?

02:02.690 --> 02:04.658
-That.
-Yeah. That looks good.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.360
"Winnie's Big Break."

02:06.394 --> 02:08.529
-Yeah. Want to watch that one?
-What about Outlanding?

02:08.562 --> 02:11.299
-No.
-That's a documentary.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.134
-No, it's a movie.
-No, it... Look.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.636
"Based on a true story."

02:15.669 --> 02:17.471
Yeah, it doesn't mean
it's a doco, though.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.840
-Yeah.
-No, it just means
it's based on a true story.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.642
No.
We want to watch that one.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.544
-Winnie's Big Break?
-Yeah.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.146
-That's boring.
-No, that's way lamer.
Look at it...

02:26.180 --> 02:30.150
-No, that's lame.
-No. Who wants to see
Winnie's Big Break?

02:30.184 --> 02:32.786
-Outvoted.
-I don't care.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.558
Shh.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.593
What?

02:41.829 --> 02:45.165
-Stop.
-What?

02:45.199 --> 02:47.201
-(music playing)
-(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

02:50.037 --> 02:52.473
(humming a tune)

02:52.506 --> 02:54.508
I'm bored.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.544
Me too.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.581
-Help me find some socks, then.
-BRITTANY: Socks?

03:00.614 --> 03:03.417
-Boring.
-Socks are important.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.353
Why?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.755
Well, they stop
your feet from smelling.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.657
Your feet stink anyway.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.060
Yeah, Uncle Ray,
your feet stink.

03:13.093 --> 03:16.096
-Do they?
-They pong.
-Yeah.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.332
-You pong.
-BRITTANY: That doesn't
even make any sense.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.568
Well, you don't make any sense.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.572
Can we go and look
at the bikes, Dad?

03:24.605 --> 03:25.806
Yeah!

03:27.475 --> 03:29.777
-Where's the bikes?
-Over there.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.812
Please?

03:34.114 --> 03:37.351
All right.
But don't go anywhere else.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.053
-Hey, Maddy?
-Yeah?

03:40.087 --> 03:42.089
Pick something out
for your birthday.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.091
-Okay.
-Can I get something, Dad?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.394
Is it your birthday?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.896
-No.
-Well?

04:00.274 --> 04:02.276
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

04:15.423 --> 04:16.724
Can I get this, Dad?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.459
No.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.260
-Please?
-No. Put it back.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.663
-You never buy me anything.
-I buy you stuff all the time.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.965
-So buy me this.
-No.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.134
-Why?
-'Cause if I do

04:27.167 --> 04:29.136
buy you everything you want,
you're gonna grow up

04:29.169 --> 04:31.839
-to be a spoiled brat.
-I don't even know what that is.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.274
A spoiled brat is a person
who gets everything they want

04:34.308 --> 04:37.445
and they're weak
and whingy and whiny.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.980
-Is that what you want
to be when you grow up?
-No.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.982
Come on, put it back.
Where's Maddy?

04:42.015 --> 04:43.617
Um, I don't know.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.118
She rode off somewhere.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.022
-Rode off where?
-Uh, around there.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.932
I want to look over here.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.869
No, you stay with me, please.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.383
Is that the bike she was on?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.418
I think so.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.658
Maddy.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.194
(singsongy):
Maddy.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.136
(sighs)
For fuck's sake.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.171
(kids laughing)

05:43.777 --> 05:45.779
(indistinct chatter)

05:51.619 --> 05:53.220
-How you going, love?
-Hello.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.855
-Lost me daughter.
-Oh, what's her name?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.857
-Maddy.
-Okay, I'll get on the P.A.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.191
All right.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.830
Maddy, can you please
come to the front counter?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.065
-You stay here.
-Maddy to the front counter,
please?

06:13.441 --> 06:15.609
-How'd you go, love?
-Uh, nothing yet.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.911
-Where did you lose her?
-Uh, just down on the left.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.380
-Uh, in the swimming...
-Have you checked
the changing rooms?

06:20.414 --> 06:21.782
Whereabouts are they?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.083
I'll show you.
Come.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.587
This way.
I like your sneakers.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.955
BRITTANY:
Thanks.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.262
-Okay, you take that side
and I'll take this side.
-Yeah.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.747
Have you got CCTV cameras,
have you?

06:53.781 --> 06:56.083
-Yeah.
-You monitor those, do you?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.486
-Yeah, in the back.
-All right, can we
go and have a...

06:58.519 --> 07:00.120
-Sure. Come with me.
-look at them?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.022
Come on.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.530
(indistinct chatter in distance)

07:12.600 --> 07:13.967
-(laughs)
-Wayne?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.669
And how's this, right?

07:15.703 --> 07:18.105
-He never got the feature.
And then...
-Wayne?

07:18.138 --> 07:19.773
-Wayne.
-and then kicked him out.
(laughs)

07:19.807 --> 07:21.174
Wa...

07:21.208 --> 07:23.243
-What the fuck?
-Last ten minutes, mate.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.812
I want to see your footage.
Okay?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.647
-Where were we, love?
-Uh, the water sports section.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.582
-RAY: Water sports section,
last ten minutes.
-Why?

07:28.616 --> 07:31.184
Wayne, please.
His kid's missing.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.190
RAY:
Keep going.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.692
WAYNE:
Well, that's ten minutes.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.028
Okay. I'll let you know, mate.
Keep going.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.931
Okay, stop it there.
All right?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.166
Zoom in on the guy.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.068
Okay.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.372
Should I call the police?

07:52.405 --> 07:54.141
-Nah.
-Jesus Christ.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.643
Okay.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.277
COMMENTATOR (on TV):
Blueboy going very well.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.146
-(ringtone playing)
-Roppinghoe in contention

07:59.179 --> 08:01.281
as they run
towards the home turn!

08:01.314 --> 08:02.482
It's Roppinghoe, Blueboy...

08:02.516 --> 08:03.984
Raymondo.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.986
Need you to listen, mate,
all right?

08:06.019 --> 08:09.222
Dirk's kid's been grabbed,
okay, from a shopping center.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.891
I got a photo of the guy.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.493
I'm gonna send that
to you now, okay?

08:13.527 --> 08:15.663
Yeah, okay, mate.
What do you need?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.898
You reckon you can get a list
of all the sex offenders

08:17.931 --> 08:19.499
around the Marrickville area?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.802
Yeah, yeah. I got a cop
I can reach out to.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.705
I'll get that ASAP and get it
to you. Anything else?

08:24.738 --> 08:26.807
Uh, look, anything
you can do, mate.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.341
-Yep.
-Um, I really need your help.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.010
-Okay?
-Yep, I'm on it.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.378
Just wait.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.347
(dialing)

08:35.683 --> 08:37.284
(rock playing on speakers)

08:39.352 --> 08:40.588
Mm.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.493
Fuck.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.728
(keyboard clicking)

08:47.761 --> 08:49.730
(phone ringing)

08:49.763 --> 08:51.098
(mutters)

08:54.067 --> 08:55.368
Yeah, mate?

08:55.402 --> 08:56.604
Mate, I need your help.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.005
Mate of mine's kid's
been grabbed

08:58.038 --> 09:00.007
from a shopping center
in Marrickville.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.575
-What?
-Yeah, she got grabbed.
Somebody grabbed her.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.276
Okay?
I got a photo of the guy.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.512
All right? I'm gonna send that
to you now, all right?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.415
-Okay.
-Great, mate. Okay.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.718
And, uh, I need you
to get out there, try to

09:10.751 --> 09:13.020
-track this prick down,
all right?
-Yeah, don't worry, I'm on it.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.387
Okay.
Thanks, mate.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.726
(grunts)

09:18.759 --> 09:21.028
Put your belt on, Britt.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.362
(phone whooshes)

09:22.395 --> 09:24.197
-Seat belt, please.
-I want Mom.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.767
Look, we're gonna find Maddy,
all right?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.670
Please, put your belt on, okay?

09:31.471 --> 09:33.306
Come on, come on.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.600
-JACINTA: Hey. Hey. Shh...
-(crying): Mom.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.203
Shh.
It's okay.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.210
(engine starts)

10:16.316 --> 10:18.318
(indistinct chatter)

10:26.193 --> 10:29.429
-(speaks Russian)
-Whoa, Gaz. Hey, please.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.432
-How you going? Hey.
-Please, please. Sit.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.301
What do you know?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.203
So I put word out,

10:36.236 --> 10:39.039
-spoke to some people.
-Mm.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.710
One of my associates
knows this guy who told story

10:42.743 --> 10:46.346
about this fellow
who he was buying weed from.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.515
He said when they went
to do deal,

10:48.548 --> 10:50.684
this guy, he says,

10:50.718 --> 10:52.953
"Do you want to see my toys?"

10:52.986 --> 10:54.788
-Toys?
-Toys.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.456
Fucking hell.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.358
You got a name for this guy?

10:58.391 --> 11:00.493
-Pidgy.
-Pidgy.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.163
-Pidgy, like pigeon. Hmm.
-Pidgy. Right.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.705
Where is she?

11:11.739 --> 11:12.706
What?

11:12.740 --> 11:16.009
Oh!
(grunting)

11:16.043 --> 11:17.177
Where is she?

11:21.849 --> 11:24.017
Pidgy?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.753
Yeah.
Who are you?

11:25.786 --> 11:28.288
I'm a friend of Hasan's.
I just need some information.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.593
All right.
Come in.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.095
-RAY: Five,
-MAN: I swear to God, mate,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.429
-four,
-I haven't... I don't know.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.365
-three,
-I haven't done anything.
Please, mate, please!

11:38.398 --> 11:40.100
-two, one.
-No, please stop!
I don't know anything.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.235
-Please.
-Where were you this morning?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.404
-Where were you this morning?!
-I haven't left.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.206
-I haven't left the house.
-GARY: Did you buy some weed

11:46.239 --> 11:47.875
off a bloke a couple
of months ago who said

11:47.908 --> 11:49.977
he had some "toys"
he wanted to sell you?

11:51.879 --> 11:54.114
Mate, you just need to be honest
with me now. All right?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.249
If you're straight with me, then
we got nothing to worry about.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.385
But if you're not, then we got
a fucking problem, okay?

11:58.418 --> 12:00.720
Who's this bloke
with the "toys"?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.824
Who's this guy?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.126
-Who is it?
-Don't know!
I don-I don't know.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.527
I've never seen that guy before.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.462
I swear to God.
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.564
-I'm sorry.
-PIDGY: Yeah, I bought

12:11.598 --> 12:13.400
a couple of kilos
off a bloke in Enmore.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.936
-Okay.
-Been buying off him
for a couple months.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.806
One day, he says,
do I want to buy some toys?

12:18.839 --> 12:21.541
And I said, "Yeah, sure," but...

12:21.574 --> 12:23.443
I didn't know.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.046
I thought he must be talking
about guns or something.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.081
Anyway, we go down
in his basement.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.651
There's a concealed room
that's behind a cupboard, right?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.086
Big old lock on the door.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.122
We open it, we go in...

12:36.790 --> 12:39.292
There's these kids,

12:39.326 --> 12:41.328
just there.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.254
-(toilet flushing)
-Babe.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.856
MICHELE:
Yeah?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.991
Where's all the dunny paper?

13:11.024 --> 13:12.425
Are we out?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.261
Well there's none
in the bathroom.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.996
Must be out, then.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.765
Well, there was, like,
ten rolls in there last week.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.133
Yeah?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.935
So, like, that's a roll a day.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.004
Yeah?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.339
What are you, like, shitting
ten times a day or something?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.976
No.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.044
Hey, look,
I'm not having a go at you.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.281
I'm just trying to understand
why you need so much of it.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.649
Okay.
Here's how it goes.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.286
-I pee, I wipe, okay?
-Yeah?

13:39.319 --> 13:42.189
Okay, then I use
my intimate wipes.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.556
Your intimate wipes?

13:43.590 --> 13:47.027
Yes. Then I grab some more
toilet paper and I wipe again.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.029
Why do you wipe again?

13:49.062 --> 13:51.031
Because my intimate wipes
are wet.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.400
I can't be walking around
all wet down there, can I?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.402
Okay.
So how much...

13:55.435 --> 13:57.637
Like, when you grab the
toilet paper to dry yourself,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.372
how many squares are we talking?

13:59.406 --> 14:01.308
I don't go by squares.
I scrunch.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.809
All right, well, why don't you
just take one square,

14:02.842 --> 14:05.913
-or fold... One, like, tw...
-Because I'll get pee

14:05.946 --> 14:07.981
on my hands,
that's why I scrunch.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.749
You don't want me touching you
with pee on my hands, do you?

14:09.782 --> 14:11.584
Well, don't you wash your hands
afterwards?

14:11.618 --> 14:14.587
Yes, I do wash my hands.
I'm sorry-- can you not afford

14:14.621 --> 14:17.991
-one roll of toilet paper a day?
-Hey, I can buy a truckload

14:18.025 --> 14:20.493
-of the stuff.
-Then why are you being
such a dick?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.729
-I'm not being a dick.
I'm just, like...
-(knocking)

14:24.097 --> 14:25.365
(sighs)

14:33.106 --> 14:35.575
-Hey, mate.
-Need to talk to ya.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.910
What about?

14:36.944 --> 14:39.379
Want to talk to your son-in-law.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.614
-Nasir? About what?
-Dirk's kid.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.850
-Dirk's kid.
-Yeah.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.118
Mate, I can
tell you right now, he's got

14:45.152 --> 14:46.786
-nothing to do with that.
-Let's go, mate.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.421
-What?
-Let's go. Come on.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.057
-Go where?
-Come on. We're going, mate.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.959
Ray. Ray.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.760
-I don't give a fuck. Let's go.
-He's an accountant.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.529
(engine idling)

14:56.563 --> 14:58.331
(horn honks)

15:03.770 --> 15:06.506
-(horn honks)
-Jesus Christ, Ray!

15:18.018 --> 15:19.519
(Freddy sighs)

15:21.288 --> 15:24.557
Now, mate, this is family here,
so just take it easy, okay?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.826
Let me do the talking, okay?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.100
Okay?

15:33.133 --> 15:35.002
Relax.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.337
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.939
-Hi, love.
-Hey, Da...

15:39.973 --> 15:41.241
-Dad...

15:41.274 --> 15:43.010
Ray, Ray.
Ray, Ray! Ray...

15:43.043 --> 15:44.111
-(gunshot)
-Ray, Jesus Christ,

15:44.144 --> 15:46.346
-Ray! What are you doing?
-Everybody down!

15:46.379 --> 15:47.647
What are you...
Ray, please, please,

15:47.680 --> 15:49.316
-think about this.
Think about this.
-SOPHIA (crying): Dad!

15:49.349 --> 15:51.484
-Where's the kid?
-What?
-FREDDY: Ray. Ray.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.153
Ray, Ray, Ray.
Don't!

15:55.555 --> 15:56.789
Where's the kid?

15:56.823 --> 15:57.957
-Jesus Christ, Ray!
-Shut the fuck up.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.926
-Please... please
don't do this, Ray.
-Shut up!

15:59.959 --> 16:02.962
-Shut up!
-I want to help you. Which kid?
-Ray...

16:02.996 --> 16:04.197
One more time, pal.
You don't tell me

16:04.231 --> 16:05.332
what I want to know-- right--

16:05.365 --> 16:07.334
I'm gonna spread
your granny's brains

16:07.367 --> 16:08.635
-all over the fucking carpet.
-Ray, don't!
-Wait, wait! No!

16:08.668 --> 16:11.304
-No, Ray.
-What kid? Shoot me!

16:12.639 --> 16:15.042
-Shoot me.
-(Sophia panting)
-Ray.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.044
-Ray, please.
-Look, I'm sorry.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.180
Look, I'm... I'm-I'm sorry.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.149
I'm sorry for what I said.
I was angry,

16:22.182 --> 16:24.117
that's-that's it.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.220
My brother was a hothead.
I know. I just...

16:27.254 --> 16:28.855
I just miss him.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.393
Listen to what he's saying.
Please, Ray. Please.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.894

16:38.165 --> 16:40.167
-Please, Ray.
-(grandmother whimpering)

16:42.202 --> 16:43.836
Oh, God.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.139
-(Nasir speaking indistinctly)
-(grandmother crying)

16:46.173 --> 16:48.708
-(car revs)
-(tires screech)

16:49.676 --> 16:50.677
Fuckin' hell, Freddy!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.145
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.481
I didn't know. You all right,
darling? I'm so sorry.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.283
I am so sorry.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.793

17:15.568 --> 17:17.570

17:30.083 --> 17:32.085
(crickets chirping)

17:44.397 --> 17:46.399
(truck passes by)

17:50.337 --> 17:52.739
-Pidgy.
-Hi.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.541
-You must be Gary.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.876
Yeah.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.278

18:13.993 --> 18:15.962
-Four?
-But I can get heaps more.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.565
Okay.
It's good stuff?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.268
-(short chuckle)
-No, Gar, it's always good.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.602
Yeah?

18:22.635 --> 18:23.803
Would you like to try it?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.472
No, no.
Pidgy vouches.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.839

Righto.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.669

Can I get you some pills?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.070
No, no, I'm all good.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.274
How about some coke?

20:07.307 --> 20:08.608
No, mate, no.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.578

20:15.147 --> 20:16.849

-(chuckles)

20:16.883 --> 20:19.519
Bloody hell.
You're a one-stop shop.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.087
Got everything, mate.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.122

Hmm?

20:42.509 --> 20:43.543
-Get the fuck over there!
-(Tim grunts)

20:43.576 --> 20:46.245
Where's the key to the door

20:46.279 --> 20:48.481
-(Pidgy shouts)
-What are you talking about?
Uh, don't shoot.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.418

22:17.069 --> 22:19.472
You know who I am?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.173
Your Uncle Ray sent me.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.643
He asked me to take you home
to your mum, okay?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.878
You want to go home?
Yeah?

22:25.912 --> 22:27.647
Okay, okay, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.383
Come on. Just go this way.
Go out this way.

Just jump in the back here.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.023
There you go.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.492
Righto, Maddy, you wait here.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.735

23:31.343 --> 23:33.613
we didn't do anything to her,

23:33.646 --> 23:34.981
(grunts)

23:43.956 --> 23:45.658
(phone dings)

24:07.480 --> 24:09.482
How you goin', Maddy--

24:14.721 --> 24:16.723
(indicator clicking)

24:26.332 --> 24:28.000
Oh...

24:28.034 --> 24:31.270
Oh, darling.
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.372
Mm.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.542
Oh, my God, darling.
(sniffles)

24:35.575 --> 24:37.544
Inside.
Out of the car.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.546
-All good?
-Thank you.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.814
You're okay.
(sniffles)

25:22.922 --> 25:24.891
(all whimpering)

25:24.924 --> 25:26.926

25:48.480 --> 25:51.250
* Looka yonder *

26:08.467 --> 26:10.469

26:10.502 --> 26:12.538

* Distant thunder
