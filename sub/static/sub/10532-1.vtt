BICYCLE THIEVES

01:34.227 --> 01:35.854
Ricci?

01:38.465 --> 01:39.864
Is Ricci here?

01:56.483 --> 01:59.475
They called you.
Are you deaf? Come on!

02:12.932 --> 02:15.526
So us bricklayers
should just starve?

02:15.735 --> 02:18.636
There's nothing I can do.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.864
Be patient.
We'll try to help everyone.

02:22.075 --> 02:26.068
That's what I'm here for.
We'll see what we can do.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.941
Ricci, there's a job for you.
- A job?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.049
You'll be putting up posters.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.185
Go to their office.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.420
Take this letter
and your work permit.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.456
- There's nothing for us?
- I'll be damned!

02:39.659 --> 02:41.058
What about us?

02:41.261 --> 02:44.287
I've just got jobs
for lathe operators.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.727
So I should just rot?

02:46.933 --> 02:49.231
What can I do?

02:49.435 --> 02:51.926
Ricci, don't forget
to take your bicycle.

02:52.138 --> 02:55.801
You need one.
It's says so on the slip, right?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.636
My bicycle?

02:57.844 --> 03:00.836
I have one...
but not at the moment.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.747
I'll have it in a couple days.
- You need one now.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.319
What's it matter?
I'll go on foot for a few days.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.686
Listen, you got one or not?
If not, someone else gets the job.

03:13.893 --> 03:18.728
- I have one!
- You're not the only one. I do too.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.692
You're a bricklayer.
That's a different category.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.301
- Then change it!
- I can't!

03:24.504 --> 03:26.665
You have a bicycle or not?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.501
Yes.
I'll report for work this morning.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.008
No joking around.
If you don't have a bike, forget it.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.149
And wait around here forever?
I'll get the bike.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.977
- Cataldi!
- Here!

03:39.185 --> 03:43.952
- Manual labor for two days.
- I'll take it.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.789
Listen, I can't make up jobs!

03:59.439 --> 04:01.805
Maria!

04:11.284 --> 04:15.243
- What is it?
- Do I have rotten luck or what?

04:16.154 --> 04:18.315
There's a job,
but I can't take it!

04:18.524 --> 04:21.789
A job?
I don't understand.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.394
What did you say?
Stop, Antonio.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.088
What did you say?
A job?

04:27.367 --> 04:29.699
And a good city job too!

04:35.241 --> 04:38.938
It'll be all right.
Can't you work things out?

04:39.145 --> 04:43.980
What's to work out?
I need my bicycle right now.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.083
I have to start right away

04:46.286 --> 04:47.913
or I lose the job.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.954
- What can we do?
- Nothing.

04:54.627 --> 04:58.859
- You should never have pawned it!
- What would you have eaten?

04:59.065 --> 05:01.761
I curse the day I was born!
- Quiet.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.266
I feel like jumping in the river!
- Quiet!

05:58.324 --> 05:59.791
Get up.

06:09.335 --> 06:12.736
- What are you doing?
- We can sleep without sheets.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.315
There are six sheets there.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.492
Linen and cotton.

06:33.693 --> 06:37.459
Good stuff. From my dowry.
- They're used.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.598
Not all of them.
Two are new.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.267
How many pieces?

06:42.468 --> 06:44.902
Six.
Three doubles, three singles.

06:45.104 --> 06:46.731
That's three.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.773
7,000 lira.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.913
Couldn't you make it a bit more?

06:56.115 --> 06:58.083
They're used.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.417
All right.
Put these in here.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.283
7,500.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.786
Name?
- Maria Ricci.

07:08.995 --> 07:13.295
Valmelaina.
Block H, Apartment 1.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.355
It's a bicycle.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.897
- 6, 100.
- Why?

07:49.368 --> 07:52.667
- Interest. It's the 31st.
- Here.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.508
It's the Fides.
Next to that red one.

08:02.715 --> 08:04.239
I know, I know.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.044
Wait a second.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.132
Where's the man in charge?

09:01.340 --> 09:02.830
Over there.

09:03.809 --> 09:06.141
Put that down.
What are you afraid of?

09:10.149 --> 09:11.776
Put that bike down.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.611
Sorry.

09:13.819 --> 09:17.880
My name is Antonio Ricci.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.424
The employment office
in Valmelaina sent me.

09:30.736 --> 09:34.934
You start in the morning. The storeroom
will give you what you need.

09:45.484 --> 09:49.011
- Tomorrow at 6:45.
- I'll be there.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.086
- How did it go?
- Good.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.520
Sorry you had to wait,
but it's all set.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.627
- What's this?
- There's a job for you too.

09:57.830 --> 10:01.459
You have to tighten
the strap on my cap. It's loose.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.266
Come look.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.268
Everyone has his own locker.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.605
See how big it is?

10:23.389 --> 10:26.415
Just think: They used
to even provide shoes.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.117
But the pay's still good.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.557
6,000 bimonthly,
plus a family allowance.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.199
And then there's overtime!

10:38.604 --> 10:41.266
Can we stop
at Via della Paglia?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.534
- What for?
- I have to see a woman.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.939
- A woman?
- Yes, a woman.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.715
Stop here a minute.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.323
Who lives here?

11:01.527 --> 11:04.257
I told you - a woman.
I'll just be a minute.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.192
I'll be right back.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.812
- Is it mine?
- No, it's mine.

11:30.790 --> 11:35.056
That makes it five to three.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.091
Concierge.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.931
Excuse me.
Does the Holy One live here?

11:49.141 --> 11:52.372
- The Holy One?
- The one who sees.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.079
I don't know.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.849
Let's try the second floor.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.886
- Is the Holy One here?
- Yes, the last door.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.811
Hey, kid, could you watch
the bike for a minute?

12:39.425 --> 12:40.722
Last door.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.793
February, March and April
have come and gone.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.464
- How long has he been in bed?
- Over a year.

12:46.665 --> 12:52.626
- You could have brought him.
- How? He can't move.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.601
This one yes, that one no.

12:56.108 --> 13:00.408
Dear God, grant me your light.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.606
Your son will rise from his bed
before the leaves fall.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.081
Before the leaves fall?

13:07.286 --> 13:08.617
Maria.

13:09.588 --> 13:10.816
Come on.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.990
Maria, let's go.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.265
Come on.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.963
What are you doing here?
- I owe her 50 lira.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.003
Come on.
Don't be stupid.

13:28.207 --> 13:31.768
She said you'd find a job.
I want to do my part.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.708
- I'll come in and tell her what I think.
- All right, all right.

13:35.915 --> 13:39.715
How can a woman with two children
and a head on her shoulders

13:39.919 --> 13:43.446
listen to all this stupid nonsense?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.385
I don't get it.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.883
What are you doing now?

13:48.093 --> 13:50.561
You must have money
to throw away.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.492
I don't know what got into you.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.396
Women!
Couldn't you spend it better?

13:57.603 --> 13:59.571
I'm just grateful.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.297
You think she got me the job?

14:03.042 --> 14:05.135
Come on. Get on.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.376
Let's go home, dummy.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.352
Hurry, Bruno.
It's 6:30.

14:20.559 --> 14:24.051
It's too dark in here
to clean it good.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.738
- Daddy, look what they did.
- What?

14:39.945 --> 14:42.175
- There's a dent.
- Maybe it was there.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.781
No, they did it.

14:44.984 --> 14:48.283
Who knows how they store them.
I'd have said something.

14:48.487 --> 14:50.478
They don't pay for the repairs!

14:50.689 --> 14:53.157
- Keep your voice down.
- All right.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.327
But I'd have said something.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.690
Is that cap ready?

15:06.538 --> 15:08.699
- What did you make?
- Egg sandwiches.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.908
Let me see. Wow!

15:15.114 --> 15:17.947
- Handsome?
- You look like a cop!

15:18.918 --> 15:22.217
Stop it!
You're hurting me!

15:23.289 --> 15:26.452
Will you behave?
You'll wake the baby!

15:34.233 --> 15:36.963
Here, Bruno.
An egg sandwich.

15:58.824 --> 16:00.291
Let's go.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.674
Bye, Mama.

17:00.152 --> 17:03.952
See you tonight at 7:00.
Wait for me here.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.061
Good morning.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.868
First, you give it
a coat of glue.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.507
Then you put up the poster.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.517
Then another
light coat of glue,

18:11.156 --> 18:14.557
flattening out the poster
and smoothing out the lumps.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.057
Got that?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.387
Beat it, kid!

18:17.596 --> 18:20.463
If you leave any lumps,

18:20.666 --> 18:24.659
the inspector will fine you.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.838
You gotta be smart
to do this job.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.442
You gotta have a good eye
and a quick hand.

18:34.079 --> 18:35.376
There.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.071
Let's go.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.316
- See you, Ricci.
- Thanks.

19:46.618 --> 19:47.949
Thief! Thief!

19:48.754 --> 19:50.278
What happened?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.164
Hop on!

20:03.368 --> 20:06.337
After him, quick!

20:08.740 --> 20:11.334
I saw him head for the tunnel!

20:13.812 --> 20:15.541
Faster!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.818
What's going on?

20:32.097 --> 20:33.029
Well?

20:33.232 --> 20:36.133
I was sure he came this way.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.895
Yeah, sure he did.

22:02.421 --> 22:06.482
Yes, there were people around,
but I had to go after him.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.182
Falloni!

22:16.301 --> 22:18.826
- What is it?
- Go to the meeting.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.470
Capece's going.

22:20.672 --> 22:24.506
Change in plans.
You and Quadrone are going.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.682
Sign this.

22:34.886 --> 22:36.911
Quadrone!
We're going to the meeting.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.851
Hurry up there!

22:42.894 --> 22:46.159
- Can you do something?
- Look yourself if you've got time.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.162
Look all over Rome?

22:48.367 --> 22:51.029
Well, I sure wouldn't recognize it.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.396
I gave you the serial number
and a description.

22:54.606 --> 22:58.474
Sure. It'd take the whole
mobile unit to look for it.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.236
Then why even file a complaint?

23:01.646 --> 23:05.207
Suppose you find it tomorrow
in a bike shop.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.977
Call a policeman.
It's on file.

23:08.186 --> 23:10.882
- Anything serious, Captain?
- Just a bicycle.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.020
- Then it's up to me?
- I've already told you.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.595
You filed your complaint.
Now good night.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.817
Don't try cutting in line!

23:50.495 --> 23:53.430
Excuse me,
but I was here first.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.826
Bruno.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.588
Daddy, it's 7:30.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.323
I took the bus. Let's go.

24:32.904 --> 24:35.065
Where's the bike?

25:00.198 --> 25:03.099
- Did it break down?
- Yeah, it broke down.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.489
You go inside.
I'll be back later.

25:29.127 --> 25:30.594
Go on.

25:47.913 --> 25:50.108
It's not about
the employment office.

25:50.315 --> 25:53.216
Without work,
people can't be placed in jobs.

25:53.418 --> 25:58.355
We've raised this issue
with the Department of Labor.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.684
A welfare check solves nothing.

26:00.892 --> 26:05.659
It just humiliates the worker
and doesn't help anything.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.662
We need a massive program
of public works.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.835
But what did they say
at today's meeting?

26:11.036 --> 26:15.336
The same as always:
"You can't expect miracles".

26:15.540 --> 26:18.304
- Is Baiocco here?
- Quiet back there.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.267
It was him!

26:20.478 --> 26:22.810
"You can be sure

26:23.014 --> 26:25.539
we'll do our best
to find you jobs".

26:47.272 --> 26:50.901
Ricci, I'm stealing your job.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.401
I'll be right back.

27:26.077 --> 27:30.036
- What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk to you.

27:30.248 --> 27:33.012
- What is it?
- They stole my bicycle.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.652
Son of a bitch!
Where?

27:35.854 --> 27:39.119
At the Florida.
I was putting up posters.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.985
How'd it happen?

27:41.192 --> 27:43.023
You've got to help me.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.865
I have to find that bike.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.031
Easier said than done.

27:51.236 --> 27:54.467
Excuse me. Baiocco, listen,
or we'll be here all night.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.197
I'm listening.

27:57.008 --> 28:01.342
If you really cared for me

28:01.546 --> 28:02.877
Quiet, everyone!

28:03.081 --> 28:05.515
You wouldn't let people tease me

28:05.717 --> 28:07.184
I heard you.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.051
You think I'm stupid?

28:11.523 --> 28:13.684
Keep rehearsing.
I'll be right there.

28:21.666 --> 28:25.898
Piazza Vittorio's your only hope,
and you gotta act quick.

28:26.104 --> 28:30.541
They unload the stuff right away.
You just have to look there.

28:34.279 --> 28:35.712
Antonio.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.218
- Is it true?
- Don't start whining.

28:41.419 --> 28:43.683
I purposely didn't go home
to avoid that.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.448
Who's whining?

28:46.691 --> 28:50.957
But this doesn't happen every day.
Did you do something?

28:51.162 --> 28:53.062
Did you look for it?

28:53.264 --> 28:57.132
Don't cry.
You look like a little girl.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.136
We'll find it.

28:59.337 --> 29:03.967
They'll swap some parts,
but it'll be on the market tomorrow.

29:04.175 --> 29:07.906
And if it is,
we'll take it home, right?

29:08.113 --> 29:12.573
You might not sleep so well tonight,
but we'll find it.

29:12.784 --> 29:14.376
Don't worry.

29:14.586 --> 29:19.046
Miss, would you care
to take a stroll with me?

29:19.257 --> 29:21.020
No, I'm with my mother.

29:23.094 --> 29:27.963
No! This is either
a rehearsal or a meeting.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.566
You tell 'em, Meniconi.
- He's right.

29:35.807 --> 29:39.436
Go home now.
We'll see what we can do.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.407
- Until tomorrow then.
- Good night.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.377
Remember what I said.
Good night.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.547
Give her a little gas
or we'll never get out of here.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.893
Get that cart out of the way.

31:05.129 --> 31:07.689
Baiocco, we're here.

31:07.899 --> 31:11.198
Meniconi and Bagonghi,
come here.

31:11.402 --> 31:15.771
What make was it?
- A lightweight Fides, 1935 model.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.169
He knows it better than me.

31:18.376 --> 31:22.005
Good. That means we can split up.
They always take them apart.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.773
Bagonghi, let's go this way.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.178
No, this way is better.

31:27.385 --> 31:30.718
You two look
at nothing but tires.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.685
You look at frames.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.985
Bruno, pumps and bells.
Let's go.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.890
- It's a Fides frame.
- Got it.

31:40.465 --> 31:47.064
We'll look for it piece by piece
and then put it back together.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.873
Bagonghi, keep your eyes open.

31:53.311 --> 31:56.474
There's only vegetables here.
We're not looking for that.

31:56.681 --> 32:00.913
We'll stroll
through the stands over there,

32:01.119 --> 32:06.182
not letting on what we're doing.
Indifferent to everything.

32:08.026 --> 32:10.051
They're setting up now.

32:18.002 --> 32:21.836
- Just look at this!
- He'll find it, I'm sure!

32:22.040 --> 32:24.531
This really gets my goat!

32:29.814 --> 32:33.306
Remember, Bruno:
Pumps and bells.

32:33.518 --> 32:36.851
If you see anything, whistle.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.681
You know what to do.
You come with me.

32:40.992 --> 32:45.122
Bruno, if we find it,
we'll celebrate.

32:50.168 --> 32:51.658
Put that down.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.703
Beat it, kid.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.958
Keep your eyes peeled
for a Fides.

33:32.944 --> 33:36.311
Looking to buy, dummy?

33:50.895 --> 33:54.558
- Let me work, or I'll give you this!
- Just try it!

33:54.766 --> 33:58.327
You cranky this morning or what?

33:58.536 --> 34:02.131
I'm in no mood for this.
Beat it.

34:02.340 --> 34:06.640
I was here first.
You wanna fight?

34:08.579 --> 34:10.809
We can't all stick together.

34:11.014 --> 34:13.380
Antonio, you look for the tires.

34:13.583 --> 34:16.553
Bagonghi, the frame.
The kid'll look for the pump.

34:16.754 --> 34:18.984
I'll look around on my own.

35:36.534 --> 35:38.559
Take a look at this frame.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.078
Yeah?

35:52.283 --> 35:54.751
- What make is that?
- You buying?

35:54.952 --> 35:57.318
Hands off.
The paint's still wet.

35:57.522 --> 35:59.456
I have to see the serial number.

35:59.657 --> 36:03.388
Why?
You buyin' serial numbers?

36:03.594 --> 36:06.927
No, he's not.
Now just show him.

36:07.131 --> 36:09.929
- And if I don't?
- Then I'll call a cop.

36:10.134 --> 36:11.999
Go ahead!

36:16.974 --> 36:18.669
You think it was stolen?

36:18.876 --> 36:22.744
Who said anything?
But you have to show the number.

36:22.947 --> 36:25.472
Do I ask to see
your shoe size? No!

36:25.683 --> 36:27.651
And I don't show you
my frame numbers!

36:27.852 --> 36:31.652
- You play the lottery with it?
- No, I don't.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.915
Wouldn't you like a bell?

36:34.125 --> 36:36.650
You've been here looking
for half an hour.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.092
Shall I buy you this one?

36:41.699 --> 36:44.691
How much is a bell?
- A hundred fifty lira.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.599
Would you like it?
Just listen.

36:48.806 --> 36:51.297
You filed your complaint.
You're covered.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.807
Show him that frame.

36:55.012 --> 36:58.379
Go ahead and look.
A man can't even work in peace.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.549
Don't you trust me either?

37:04.121 --> 37:09.024
12024.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.922
Is it yours?

37:12.930 --> 37:14.693
You got paint on you.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.498
It's not a matter of trust.

37:17.702 --> 37:20.398
A man who's been robbed
has a right to look.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.232
Who's stopping you?

37:23.040 --> 37:25.634
We all make mistakes.

37:39.223 --> 37:40.520
Hey, buddy,

37:40.725 --> 37:43.694
we're all honest here
in Piazza Vittorio!

37:47.698 --> 37:49.165
Forget about him.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.598
Just look for a Fides.
- What do you think I'm doing?

37:53.804 --> 37:57.069
- Where's my son?
- He must be over by the carts.

37:57.275 --> 38:01.268
- There's nothing more for us here.
- It's tough.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.912
How about something else?

38:05.583 --> 38:07.847
Stay with me.

38:08.052 --> 38:09.485
Come on.

38:14.425 --> 38:19.795
Antonio, take him to Porta Portese.
We'll keep looking here.

38:19.997 --> 38:23.660
Our chances are better here.
It's too late for Porta Portese.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.836
Go on now.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.495
Go with him.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.365
Careful.

39:04.408 --> 39:07.275
You just can't win.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.446
It rains every Sunday.

39:12.483 --> 39:16.146
Sundays I'm off at 1:00,
and where can you go?

39:17.021 --> 39:21.287
Movies bore me.
I just don't like 'em.

39:21.492 --> 39:24.620
Look at this guy!
I ought to run him over!

39:24.829 --> 39:27.389
Stupid jerk!

39:27.598 --> 39:31.090
They jump out in front of you
and you end up in jail

39:31.302 --> 39:33.930
before you even know
what's happened!

39:34.705 --> 39:38.539
Look at this rain.

39:38.743 --> 39:41.576
You just can't win.
It rains every Sunday.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.178
What happened?

41:29.386 --> 41:31.149
I fell down!

41:31.856 --> 41:33.551
Wipe yourself off.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.273
- You afraid of rain?
- Don't want to get my tux wet!

43:14.325 --> 43:16.987
- A hundred lira?
- You're lucky to get that.

43:17.194 --> 43:19.219
What can I do with this?

43:29.306 --> 43:30.830
Stop him!

43:40.618 --> 43:43.746
Stop him! Thief!

43:54.665 --> 43:57.133
Bruno, let's find that old man!

44:07.711 --> 44:09.975
There he is, Daddy!

44:38.842 --> 44:41.402
Damn it!
Where did he go?

44:57.161 --> 44:59.527
Bruno, where are you going?

45:23.954 --> 45:25.649
Bruno!

45:25.856 --> 45:27.824
What are you doing?
Come on!

45:41.805 --> 45:44.330
Excuse me.
I want to ask you something.

45:44.541 --> 45:47.999
That young man who was with you -
where can I find him?

45:48.212 --> 45:49.201
What young man?

45:49.413 --> 45:51.904
He talked to you
and then rode off on a bike.

45:52.116 --> 45:55.574
- Why? What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

45:55.786 --> 45:57.913
It's an urgent private matter.

45:58.122 --> 46:01.353
What can I tell you?
I don't know him.

46:01.558 --> 46:03.822
You were together
under the arches!

46:04.027 --> 46:07.155
There are lots of young men
under the arches.

46:07.831 --> 46:12.393
Wait a second.
I have to talk to him.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.037
Let me go!
Leave me alone, kid.

46:15.239 --> 46:18.902
I'm just an old man
who minds his own business,

46:19.109 --> 46:22.101
and what do I get? Trouble.

46:42.566 --> 46:45.660
It's late! You're supposed
to be here by 10:00.

46:45.869 --> 46:49.805
- They said you were always open.
- Go on now.

47:05.322 --> 47:09.156
- What about lunch?
- Later. You need a mess kit.

47:09.359 --> 47:14.319
You first-timers, take your mess kits
out into the courtyard.

47:14.531 --> 47:18.467
Go ahead now.
There's no time to lose.

47:22.940 --> 47:27.240
Line them up neatly,
not like last time.

47:27.444 --> 47:30.436
Each of you will come pick up

47:30.647 --> 47:32.740
your own mess kit later.

47:34.551 --> 47:37.520
Maybe I should get a shave.

47:38.822 --> 47:42.053
You need a shave?
Then come inside.

47:43.961 --> 47:45.428
Sit down.

47:50.367 --> 47:51.834
Go inside.

47:52.035 --> 47:56.028
Will you be much longer, Counselor?
- No, just these two.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.434
No, not me.

47:57.641 --> 47:59.836
Then we can begin.

48:05.849 --> 48:10.684
Don't shave my chin.
I'm letting it grow there.

48:10.988 --> 48:13.115
Hurry, the priest's waiting.

48:13.323 --> 48:14.950
That's enough now, Counselor.

48:15.158 --> 48:17.183
You need another barber.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.362
Come with me, little boy.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.417
Move over, would you?

49:38.775 --> 49:41.801
I have to find that young man.
It's a personal matter.

49:42.012 --> 49:44.037
I have to talk to him.

49:47.184 --> 49:49.345
Will you tell me
where I can find him?

49:49.553 --> 49:51.646
Just leave me alone.

49:51.855 --> 49:54.016
I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:57.494 --> 49:59.792
Page six.

50:02.666 --> 50:06.261
"May I leave this holy place...

50:11.408 --> 50:14.434
with my soul purified..."

50:18.582 --> 50:22.814
There's money in it for him.
Where is he?

50:23.020 --> 50:27.150
- I don't have to say.
- You do too, or I'll get the police.

50:27.357 --> 50:29.951
What have I done to you?
Leave me alone.

50:31.795 --> 50:33.092
Lay off.

50:33.296 --> 50:39.201
"Though I may travel once more
the path of sorrow and hardship..."

50:39.736 --> 50:42.000
Just tell me where he is.

50:42.205 --> 50:43.934
What can you lose?

50:44.141 --> 50:46.132
I've got nothing against you.

50:46.343 --> 50:49.574
In fact, I'm prepared to pay.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.812
- What's for lunch?
- Pasta and potatoes.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.288
Will you tell me?

51:01.124 --> 51:04.560
Jail is worse, you know.
You'll rot there.

51:06.096 --> 51:08.894
Where is he?
- All right. Via della Campanella.

51:10.700 --> 51:12.429
What number?

51:12.702 --> 51:14.966
Ah, for chrissake!

51:15.338 --> 51:17.670
I think it's No. 15.

51:20.043 --> 51:23.308
- You're coming with me.
- Go by yourself.

51:23.513 --> 51:26.573
No! You come with me
or I call the police!

51:26.883 --> 51:29.750
I'm tired of begging you!
You got that?

51:29.953 --> 51:32.888
Quiet, or I'll have you thrown out!

51:43.433 --> 51:45.298
Are you coming?

51:45.502 --> 51:48.596
I'm not going anywhere.

51:48.805 --> 51:51.467
- What have you got to lose?
- Go away!

51:51.675 --> 51:54.644
- I'm losing my patience.
- Lose whatever you like.

51:54.845 --> 51:58.212
Goddamn it!
Come along or I'm going to the police.

51:58.415 --> 52:01.213
Do whatever the hell you like.

52:02.586 --> 52:04.747
You're coming with me, you hear?

52:06.723 --> 52:10.489
Leave me alone
or you'll be sorry.

52:11.094 --> 52:12.857
Come on, let's go!

52:13.063 --> 52:15.964
I'm not going anywhere.

52:16.166 --> 52:18.930
- I'll show you. Come on!
- Leave me alone!

52:25.509 --> 52:29.775
- At least let me get my lunch first.
- I'm going with you.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.948
Just when I can get
a decent meal!

52:34.217 --> 52:35.377
Stop them.

52:35.585 --> 52:38.315
- Where are you going?
- To get this man's lunch.

53:01.211 --> 53:03.236
Did a man come this way?

53:03.446 --> 53:07.883
No, and we're not ready yet.
Girls, more over here.

53:08.285 --> 53:10.947
Not so much there.

53:14.224 --> 53:16.454
Just what do you want?

53:16.660 --> 53:20.027
- I want to get out!
- It's locked, and the lawyer has the key!

53:20.230 --> 53:24.496
Stop making such a racket!
You're in church!

53:29.773 --> 53:31.570
Will you please just leave?

53:33.710 --> 53:37.339
This is no way to behave in church!
Come with me!

53:41.651 --> 53:43.118
Stop!

53:43.320 --> 53:45.754
I have to find him.
I know he's here.

53:56.533 --> 53:59.161
Did you come to hear mass
or make trouble?

53:59.836 --> 54:01.804
Just what do you want?

54:02.005 --> 54:05.839
I told you:
I'm looking for an old man!

54:14.050 --> 54:16.018
I've got to find him!

54:18.188 --> 54:20.713
Where do you think you're going?

54:20.924 --> 54:22.721
He came this way!

54:28.898 --> 54:32.163
- Who knows where he's gone now.
- That's enough!

54:39.342 --> 54:41.742
He didn't just fly away.

54:45.882 --> 54:47.713
Why'd you let him
go for his lunch?

54:47.917 --> 54:49.976
Would you shut up!

54:55.759 --> 54:58.489
Where are you going?
Come back here.

54:59.195 --> 55:00.560
Come on!

55:01.698 --> 55:04.258
You coming or not?
- No!

55:05.802 --> 55:07.463
Let's go!

55:07.671 --> 55:09.639
Some kid I have!
Come on!

55:09.839 --> 55:12.865
- Why did you hit me?
- You asked for it.

55:13.076 --> 55:16.375
Let's go.
- No. You go alone.

55:16.579 --> 55:18.513
Will you come on?

55:22.952 --> 55:25.011
Little troublemaker.

55:27.791 --> 55:31.420
You're a little nag.
- I'm gonna tell Mama.

55:31.628 --> 55:34.096
We'll settle this at home.

55:37.701 --> 55:41.330
Wait for me by the bridge,
you hear?

55:44.674 --> 55:47.108
I'm gonna look for the old man.

56:14.337 --> 56:17.272
Help! A boy's drowning!

57:31.614 --> 57:35.106
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

57:57.540 --> 58:01.874
Bruno, put on your jacket.
You'll catch a chill.

58:02.078 --> 58:03.739
Go ahead.

58:06.516 --> 58:07.983
Come on.

58:11.721 --> 58:12.915
Put it on.

58:25.602 --> 58:27.126
You tired?

58:29.038 --> 58:30.562
Sit down for a minute.

58:30.773 --> 58:33.640
Not much we can do now
but go home.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.470
Sit down.

58:43.052 --> 58:45.452
Go, Modena!

58:49.726 --> 58:51.523
Is Modena a good team?

58:57.500 --> 58:59.263
You hungry?

59:10.113 --> 59:11.740
How about a pizza?

59:19.188 --> 59:21.884
Let's go.

59:22.325 --> 59:26.159
Why kill myself worrying
when I'll end up just as dead anyway?

59:26.362 --> 59:28.262
Come on.

59:46.115 --> 59:47.742
Sit down.

59:51.854 --> 59:54.118
Let's forget everything
and get drunk!

59:55.992 --> 59:56.856
Waiter.

59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.520
Arrigo, help this gentleman.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.590
A half bottle?

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.429
- A full bottle and a pizza.
- We don't serve pizza.

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:10.367
- You don't?
- This isn't a pizzeria.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.569
- We want to eat.
- Eat?

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:15.073
- Yeah, eat!
- What do you want?

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:20.777
You want a mozzarella sandwich?

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:24.244
Two mozzarella sandwiches
and a full bottle.

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:28.649
There'll be dessert later too.
How about that?

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:00.620
What's the matter? Drink.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:06.095
If your mother saw me
giving you wine!

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.733
But we can do as we like.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:17.973
You can explain it this way

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:21.007
Or explain it that way

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.873
Call him Ciccio or Antonio
Beppe or Ciro

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:28.812
He's still a little black child
How could that have happened

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.168
Let's just eat and enjoy.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.736
There's a cure for everything...

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.711
except death.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.658
To eat like them,

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:46.056
you'd have to earn
a million lira a month.

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.563
Eat, eat. Don't worry.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.796
You like it?

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:15.182
Things were going great.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:19.221
With overtime, I figured -

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.656
I'll show you.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.899
12,000 a month salary.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:37.235
Here, you write it down.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.710
12,000 salary...

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:48.252
plus 2,000 overtime...

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:50.982
plus the family allowance.

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:54.920
Altogether, 800 a day.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:58.596
Thirty times 800 - just imagine.

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:02.336
What more could you ask?

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:06.372
And I should just kiss it good-bye?
Well, I won't.

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:10.876
See now why we have to find it?
Otherwise we don't eat.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.707
What can we do?

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:16.146
We'll go to the Porta Portese
every day.

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.820
We'll find those guys there.

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:20.318
Yeah, sure.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.992
Those guys are long gone.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:28.024
We'd never find them
with all your mother's candles

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.859
or all the saints in the world.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:42.374
Sports news.
Just like every Sunday,

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:47.641
soccer teams throughout Italy
will play their scheduled matches today.

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:52.521
Of course, fans are excited
about the championship series.

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.747
Teams scheduled to play today...

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.359
Last door.

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:12.202
I'm afraid of what she might say.

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:17.038
Don't be afraid. Tell her everything,
like you would your confessor.

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:22.309
I just hope you're right.
O holy Mother of God!

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:32.055
This one yes, that one no.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.196
Sow in some other field.

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:38.799
You understand what I mean?

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.229
No, I don't.

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.927
How can you not understand,
dear boy?

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:45.198
It's simple.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:49.811
What good is sowing seeds
if the soil is unreceptive?

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.709
You plant,
but you harvest nothing.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.747
Understand?

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:00.054
No, I really don't.

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:03.515
She doesn't love you!
Forget about her!

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.929
My dear boy,
you're very ugly.

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:13.262
Very ugly.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.870
There are so many other women.

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:20.941
Sow your seeds in a different field.
Will you do that?

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.216
Mama, it's getting cold.

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:36.421
Good day.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.528
Daddy, come on!

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:49.261
There's room now!

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:53.901
You have to wait your turn.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:58.809
Excuse me,
but we've been waiting for hours.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.984
- Why don't you wait your turn?
- I'm in a hurry.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:05.176
Well, so are we.

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:08.016
Please understand,
I beg of you.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:11.090
Behave yourselves.

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:13.725
Behave yourselves!

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:18.090
These ladies are first,
and then me.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.325
Stop arguing!

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:23.767
I shed my light on all.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.032
This one yes, that one no.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.144
Dear God, grant me your light.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.304
Grant me your light.

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:37.145
What is it?

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:43.121
What?

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.329
They stole what?
- My bicycle.

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:50.396
Your bicycle?

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.760
What can I say, my son?

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:55.596
I can only tell you what I see.

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.432
Listen carefully.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.100
Either you find it right away
or you never will. Understand?

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:07.476
Either you find it right away,
or you'll never see it again.

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.674
Find it right away?
But where?

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:12.752
I don't know
what else to tell you.

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:15.219
Go now,
and try to understand.

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:18.791
Find it right away
or you never will.

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.777
Adele, what is it today?

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.814
My husband's still drinking.

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:45.680
It's your cross to bear.
Stop giving him money.

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:49.051
What can I do?
He takes it.

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.416
We're closed!
The ladies are having lunch!

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:52.644
Closed means closed
for everyone!

01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:56.714
Look here!
And with a kid too!

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:59.724
Don't you see
you can't come in?

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:02.796
Get out!
You can't go in!

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.727
Where's he gone to now?

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:08.165
Get out of here!

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.065
Where's he gone?

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:15.300
Closed means closed
for everybody!

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:19.845
- Where is he?
- How would I know? There he is!

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:23.018
You can't go in the rooms!

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.449
- Let me go!
- Scoundrel!

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:28.817
That's the dining room!
Get out of here!

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.494
Get out!
- I want to talk to him.

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.461
I don't even know you.

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:40.260
Well, you will.
Step outside.

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:43.165
Someone call the police!

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.740
Stop shouting.
I've got a headache.

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:48.068
- I want to talk to you!
- Me?

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.370
- Don't talk to him.
- Shut up.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:53.207
You want me?
Here I am.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:58.251
- Give me my bike back!
- Get your hands off me!

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:09.324
You ruined everything for me!

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:13.262
Get your hands off me!
I'm not afraid of you!

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.734
This is the finest house in Rome.
If the police chief should find out -

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:26.042
Outside with you,

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:29.115
and don't ever come back!

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:34.051
Well, what do you want?

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:39.589
- Give me back what you stole!
- What did I steal?

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:44.164
Look at this guy!
What did I steal of yours?

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.098
My bicycle!

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.965
What bicycle?
I'm no thief.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:56.969
- You're not going anywhere.
- Leave me alone or I'll flatten you!

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:00.807
I'll kill you
if you don't give it back!

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.951
I'm not leaving here
until you give it back!

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.589
Look at this crazy man!
Leave me alone.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.257
Get your hands off me!

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:13.224
I didn't do anything.
You're trying to set me up.

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:16.091
I'm not leaving
until you give back what you stole.

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:18.766
You stole my bike yesterday

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.491
at the Florida!

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.933
I wasn't even there yesterday!

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.766
You were there with this cap!

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:30.274
- You can't just accuse people!
- Get some glasses!

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:34.608
- Leave me alone.
- No, I won't! You got that?

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:37.012
Alfredo!
What's that scoundrel want?

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.880
He won't let me go.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:42.353
Hands off! I was
at the general market yesterday.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.389
Are you crazy?

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:55.099
You say this man here
stole your bicycle?

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.703
Yes, he did.

01:12:56.905 --> 01:13:00.568
- You're sure it was him?
- Of course I am!

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:03.711
- Where do you claim he stole it?
- Near the Florida.

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:07.370
Why not go to the police?
He lives right here.

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:11.576
Get the police.
Go ahead.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:14.620
What are you waiting for?

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.719
Get the police.
I've got nothing to hide.

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:20.827
You're not going anywhere,
you hear?

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.463
Don't touch me!

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:25.860
Get him off me!

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:35.067
- You'd better go.
- Look what you've done.

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:39.646
- Be sure before you accuse someone.
- You won't get away with this.

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:43.750
His head!
Don't let him hit his head!

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:52.024
You better go.
And next time, be sure first!

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:56.664
Besides getting a good beating,
you could be sued for libel.

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:04.499
Get him out of here
or I'll kill him!

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:08.233
My boy!
Mama's pride and joy!

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:11.670
- Just go, will you?
- Get your hands off me!

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.871
Get your facts straight next time!

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:19.315
You already lost your bike, stupid!
Want to lose your wallet too?

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.884
Cowards,
ganging up on one man!

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:26.424
You're all thieves!

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:31.559
- Are you crazy!
- Just trying to cool that guy down!

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:44.712
Where's this bicycle fellow?

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:49.315
There he is,
putting on a show.

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:54.285
What show?
Can't you see he's half dead?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.618
- Where do you live?
- Right there. I've got nothing to hide.

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:01.421
You can't accuse my son!
He's got a clean record!

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.224
They'll all tell you!

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.333
Just because he wears
a German cap.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:09.368
Isn't my cap German too?

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:12.404
- Get up.
- You can't move him!

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:15.406
Officer, he's very sick.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.135
Then take me to your house.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.246
For heaven's sake...

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:24.216
we're honest people.
Come and see.

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:26.948
Come.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.625
I'd sue you for slander.

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:37.321
That boy's never hurt a flea.

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:48.007
See for yourself.
Four of us live in this one room.

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:55.342
Here's his bed.
See any bicycles under here?

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:58.952
My two other kids and I
all sleep there.

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:06.755
Instead of insulting my poor boy,
you should give him a job.

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:10.090
He's always looking for one,
bless his soul.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.168
Those belong
to my brother-in-law.

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:22.139
He used to have a car.

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:28.907
Sure, look under the bed.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:31.984
You see any bicycles?

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.624
Listen.

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:47.391
Can anyone testify on your behalf?
- I'll testify.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.070
You?

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:56.437
Could you step outside?

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.116
Take all day for all I care.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.718
You could be mistaken.
You sure you recognize him?

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:10.619
Of course I'm sure.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.560
Come here.

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:15.320
See all of them?

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:27.367
They'll all testify for him.
I see it every day.

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:31.512
Did you see his face?
- Yes, as he took off with it.

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.476
So you saw his back.

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:36.674
No, I saw his face, because -

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:41.348
- Were there other people around?
- Yes.

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:44.457
Did you get the names
of any witnesses?

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.390
I couldn't stop to get names.

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.496
Then you're out of luck.

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:21.053
You didn't get a good look at his face,
and you have no witnesses.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:24.061
Maybe you're right,
but you have no proof.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.933
And if he is innocent,
you're in trouble.

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:30.627
You have to catch
these characters red-handed.

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.466
I'll smash his face in!

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.904
Then I'd have to arrest you.

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:39.639
If you only knew
what this means to me.

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:49.613
Come here.

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.795
I feel better.
I can go with you now.

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.521
What did you find? Nothing!

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.099
I've got a clean record.

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:03.100
- What's your name?
- Alfredo Catelli.

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:05.398
You want to press charges?

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:08.804
My son's got a clean record.

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:13.876
That's right.
You'd better just leave.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.944
Send us a postcard!

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:26.516
Coming around here
to accuse people!

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:37.298
Bruno, come on.

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.455
Don't come around here again.

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:49.016
Bruno, take the streetcar.
Wait at Monte Sacro.

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:55.955
You heard me! Go on!

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:32.998
Thief!

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.169
Stop him! Thief!

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:38.733
Stop that guy!

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:17.605
Trying to ruin everything,
are you?

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:21.680
This bike is all I have!

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:27.144
You're going to jail!

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:34.060
Beat it, kid!

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:09.928
- Where to?
- The police station.

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:15.433
We can't all go.
Pasquale and I will take him.

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:24.542
- Forget it. Let him go.
- Just like that?

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:27.510
I don't want trouble.
Thanks for your help.

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:31.815
You're a fine example for your son.
You should be ashamed.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.013
You got off easy.
If it were me, you'd go to jail.

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:39.284
Go home now.
Beat it!

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.519
Get out of here!

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:45.255
And you can thank God.
