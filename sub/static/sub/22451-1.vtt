00:34.534 --> 00:34.533
Derek: So, what do you think?

00:34.535 --> 00:39.271
Andrew: It's good, it's a
little cliche, don't you think?

00:39.273 --> 00:41.273
-No, that's not cliche.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.242
That's how every found
footage movie starts.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.543
-I know, that's why
i called it cliche.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.578
Mark: Yeah, that or a
fake police evidence tag.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.480
-Yeah, and plus, if the
bodies were never recovered

00:48.482 --> 00:51.383
you know, how did they
find the footage?

00:51.385 --> 00:54.653
-Yeah, no, of course, I'm
saying this looks good--

00:54.655 --> 00:55.821
-oh, no this looks great!

00:55.823 --> 00:57.389
Yeah, the text and everything,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.491
it's very impressive.
-Thank you.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.360
-Yeah, no, absolutely, but
again, in this first part,

01:01.362 --> 01:02.628
it doesn't say
anything about why

01:02.630 --> 01:02.628
they were filming
in the first place,

01:02.630 --> 01:05.330
it just says that the
footage was found.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.566
What footage?
-The vacation video footage?

01:07.568 --> 01:10.069
-No, I know that, but the
audience needs to know that.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.605
-Yeah.

01:13.607 --> 01:13.605
-Right.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.442
-No, of course they do.
-Right.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.244
-Right, no, I'm saying, yeah,
we should put that in there.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.579
-I agree, that's a great idea.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.414
-Obviously, but it looks
good and we should add that.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.550
-It looks great, and we
should put that in there.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.785
-There it is then, it's
happening, we're making movies.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.687
This guy right here comin'
up with good ideas,

01:28.689 --> 01:30.255
that's why I hired
him as director.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.658
Let's put it in, rock star.
-Terrific.

01:41.201 --> 01:42.701
-It's not gonna fit dude.
-We got everything?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.103
-This is it man.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.571
-It's everything.
-This'll fit in there.

01:45.573 --> 01:46.605
-Is this the new pa?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.407
Derek: Yep.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.643
Andrew: Oh good, he can
give us a hand. We need it.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.113
Derek: Hey! There she is!

01:54.115 --> 01:55.647
-I'm good, how are you?

01:55.649 --> 01:57.783
- I'm good too.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.118
Lily, I want you to meet Andrew.

01:59.120 --> 01:59.785
This is our director.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.220
Mark: Hi Andrew, Lily.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.154
This is my brother mark.

02:02.156 --> 02:02.154
-Hey mark.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.423
-Mark, this is
Lily, our new pa.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.557
Mark: I'd shake
your hand, but--

02:05.559 --> 02:06.191
-you're filming.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.259
Mark: Yeah.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.866
-It is very
expensive sound gear.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.435
Good stuff, top
shelf stuff here,

02:16.437 --> 02:18.537
probably seen these, you
know, on set, people do that.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.739
This is my boom stick.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.808
Shop smart, shop s-mart.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.654
-Okay, good point, except
that's not gonna be enough.

02:35.656 --> 02:40.192
Hundreds, thousands of
movies get made every year,

02:40.194 --> 02:42.461
never seen the light of day
because they don't have

02:42.463 --> 02:45.564
a huge movie star or
big special effects,

02:45.566 --> 02:45.564
which we don't have
the budget for,

02:45.566 --> 02:51.170
so we have to find a way to
make people pay attention to us.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.239
We need to generate
free publicity.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.307
-Okay.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.275
-But how do you do that?

02:56.277 --> 02:57.910
How do you make free press?

02:57.912 --> 02:59.878
Well, the way I see it,
there are two ways to do it.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.847
One, create controversy, right.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.948
You piss the right people off,

03:02.950 --> 03:04.716
they will write about you.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.553
So, I got to thinking,
you know what,

03:07.555 --> 03:10.222
let's write in like a
pedophile catholic priest,

03:10.224 --> 03:11.523
that'll get the
catholics all riled up.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.393
-Don't do that though.
-I'm not going to.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.694
-Oh my god.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.564
-Because there is another
way to get free press,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.732
and that is to be the
first at something.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.234
-Okay

03:22.869 --> 03:25.671
-sharknado! Yes? Right?

03:25.673 --> 03:29.441
Deadly aquatic life forms,
deadly weather patterns,

03:29.443 --> 03:30.709
first movie to combine them,

03:30.711 --> 03:33.212
total piece of shit as a film,

03:33.214 --> 03:35.614
but it sold at afm last
year based on the concept--

03:35.616 --> 03:37.216
-wait, I know, but
again, I feel like

03:37.218 --> 03:38.817
"piece of shit" is not
what we're goin' for.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.921
-Of course not, but what if we
make a kick ass scary movie,

03:42.923 --> 03:45.624
and we are also the first
at something noteworthy.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.726
That would be like the
best of both worlds.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.462
Right? Come for the concept,
stay for the great film.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.731
-Okay, so what are we
gonna be the first to do?

03:55.301 --> 03:57.736
-Get ready to have
your minds blown.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.439
Hold onto your knickers, because

04:00.441 --> 04:05.344
as of this morning we are
no longer just shooting

04:05.346 --> 04:08.347
the greatest found footage
horror movie ever made.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.982
We are shooting...

04:12.952 --> 04:14.786
Drum roll.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.790
Drum roll, can i
get a drum roll?

04:18.791 --> 04:20.358
-I don't do sound effects.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.863
He's not gonna stop
until you drum roll.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.965
-Trust me you are going to
want to be doing a drum roll

04:26.967 --> 04:28.700
when you find out.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.770
- Okay, okay. Very
good.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.506
-We are shooting the first ever

04:34.508 --> 04:36.041
found footage horror movie...

04:38.011 --> 04:39.544
In 3D.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.680
-What?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.448
Derek: We're shooting in 3D.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.450
-We're shooting in 3D?
-We are shooting in 3D.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.518
-How are we shooting in 3D?

04:46.520 --> 04:46.518
-That's what I'm showing you.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.954
Check it out, this is
the camera, look at it.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.656
-No, I'm sorry---
right lens, left lens.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.057
Just like in reality.

04:52.059 --> 04:55.327
-I mean, how does that even
make sense in the story?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.963
Why would your
character film in 3D?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.765
-Why wouldn't he film in 3D?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.900
-Well, because in the
premise of spectre of death--

05:01.902 --> 05:05.704
-spectre of death 3D.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.808
-That's very good, okay,
in the premise of the film,

05:11.077 --> 05:12.577
it's a vacation video.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.414
So, who shoots their
vacation videos in 3D?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.082
-I don't know...
Japanese people?

05:17.084 --> 05:17.082
-He's probably accurate.

05:17.084 --> 05:23.055
-No, okay, whatever, my
character is now a filmmaker.

05:23.057 --> 05:26.591
I'm not a documentarian.
I shoot everything in 3D,

05:26.593 --> 05:28.093
I'm a 3D enthusiast.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.695
-That's not a thing.
-It is now.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.367
-Look at this.

05:36.703 --> 05:40.339
- Ah ,
that's pretty cool.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.541
The monitor's in 3D too,
look at this, mark.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.809
Look, watch.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.410
Mark: What?

05:45.412 --> 05:46.678
-Do somethin'.

05:50.718 --> 05:56.088
Andrew: That's terrific.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.690
-Because not only are we
shooting the first ever

05:58.692 --> 05:59.991
found footage
horror movie in 3D.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.127
We are also shooting
the first ever

06:02.129 --> 06:05.497
behind the scenes
documentary... also in 3D.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.798
Andrew: How much did
you spend on this thing?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.133
-Doesn't matter.
We can return it.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.835
-Do you have enough
batteries for this thing?

06:09.837 --> 06:11.536
Derek: Dude, quit
pissing in the pool,

06:11.538 --> 06:12.971
and just get into it already.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.873
Look at that, you're hanging
onto a goldmine right there.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.041
Andrew: It's beautiful,
don't get me wrong.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.613
-This is a very
impressive gimmick.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.816
-I wish you would've told
me about this sooner.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.419
-I wish I had
thought of it sooner.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.488
-I still vote for
the pedophile priest.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.789
-We're not doing
the pedophile priest

06:30.791 --> 06:35.727
- ahh.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.429
It's like I can touch you.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.664
-I feel like, you
know,, it's...

06:39.666 --> 06:39.664
Alright, so apparently
we're shooting

06:39.666 --> 06:44.069
the first ever found
footage horror film in 3D,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.971
and I've got about 12 hours

06:45.973 --> 06:47.639
to figure out how
this thing works,

06:47.641 --> 06:48.774
and to rearrange my whole plan

06:48.776 --> 06:52.177
for how I'm gonna
shoot it... in 3D.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.111
Hey Carl.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.881
3D.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.451
-That has absolutely
no effect on sound.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.886
Andrew: Derek?

07:00.888 --> 07:01.987
Derek: Yo.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.822
-It's gettin' a little late.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.157
Derek: Yeah, it is.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.025
-Well, we still don't
have our lead actress.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.928
Derek: Yeah, no shit,
tell me somethin' new.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.696
-Do you want me to call her?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.465
Derek: Do whatever
the fuck you wanna do.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.433
Andrew: What does
that even mean?

07:14.435 --> 07:15.167
Lily: I'll call her.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.868
-Can you? Thank you.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.004
It's just gonna
be a little tough

07:19.006 --> 07:21.072
to do the film without her.

07:21.074 --> 07:21.072
-It's gonna be a lot tough

07:21.074 --> 07:23.942
to do the film with
her, trust me.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.978
Carl: Derek and Amy, I've
worked with several times.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.180
The last time we worked together

07:28.182 --> 07:29.514
was probably about
six months ago

07:29.516 --> 07:31.983
on the indiegogo campaign.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.585
Right around the time
that their marriage

07:33.587 --> 07:36.188
was finally, um...

07:36.190 --> 07:37.222
How do I put it delicately?

07:39.492 --> 07:43.562
It's appropriate that we
are filming a horror movie.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.031
-Andrew, hi, sorry I'm late.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.067
-No worries, you're
fine, you're here.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.502
Can we get you anything?
You want water?

07:50.504 --> 07:50.502
You want
something to eat?

07:50.504 --> 07:52.838
-No, I'm okay. I'm
sorry, I'm just late.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.139
Andrew: You're
fine, no worries.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.173
-What's this? The
behind the scenes?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.041
Andrew: A little bit, yeah.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.576
-Yeah.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.844
What?

07:58.846 --> 07:59.845
Mark!

07:59.847 --> 08:01.913
Hi! Is that you?

08:03.049 --> 08:04.583
Oh, it's so good to see you.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.851
Mark: It's good
to see you too.

08:05.853 --> 08:06.685
- How's it goin'?

08:06.687 --> 08:07.919
Mark: Good.

08:07.921 --> 08:07.919
Derek: Andrew.

08:07.921 --> 08:12.624
Mark: Okay, so are
you excited to be here?

08:13.693 --> 08:16.761
-Yes, yeah, it feels
really good to be here.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.897
I'm excited to be working
with Derek again,

08:18.899 --> 08:21.199
and Andrew's a
wonderful director,

08:21.201 --> 08:25.070
and just glad to be
on a feature again.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.838
I've been doing a lot of--

08:26.840 --> 08:28.573
mark: Hold on, sorry, i
need to adjust your mic.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.510
-I wasn't really expecting

08:32.513 --> 08:34.145
to be doing this
right now anyway.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.847
I'm not really made up.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.215
-It's fine, you look fine.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.552
You look...

08:41.287 --> 08:43.288
You look b-b-...

08:43.890 --> 08:45.190
You look beautiful.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.826
-Thank you.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.795
Can I ask you a question?

08:51.764 --> 08:53.632
Mark: Mmm-hmm.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.870
-Did Derek say anything to
you about me, or us at all?

09:00.773 --> 09:02.841
I'm just trying to piece out why

09:02.843 --> 09:05.243
he asked me to still do this.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.947
After everything, it just
seemed a little strange.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.816
And I don't know, I thought
maybe... you guys are close,

09:11.818 --> 09:13.084
and he said something.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.121
Did he?
-Nope.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.324
-Are you sure?

09:20.726 --> 09:21.760
-Yeah.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.700
Derek: Here we go! En route!

09:35.841 --> 09:37.142
Derek: Is he sleeping?

09:37.144 --> 09:38.777
Mark: Yeah.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.314
-Lily, do you have
the forks? The forks?

09:42.316 --> 09:43.715
-Don't.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.152
-Awe, leg cramp, oh god.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.591
Herr director.
-Hey.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.960
-How long till we actually
make it to the actual location?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.596
-About an hour and a half.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.897
Andrew: Where did you
find this place anyway?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.966
-Amy's family owns it.

10:00.968 --> 10:04.336
Her uncle or somethin' built
it during the depression.

10:04.338 --> 10:05.937
-She's asleep.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.006
Carl: Very funny,
Derek, hilarious.

10:08.008 --> 10:08.807
-Is this good?

10:08.809 --> 10:09.307
Mark: Yeah.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.775
-Okay.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.278
Mark: So basically,
just talk about how you

10:13.280 --> 10:14.779
became involved with
the spectre of death.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.014
-Oh, okay.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.818
Yeah, I met Derek at
a party last week,

10:19.820 --> 10:22.220
and he asked me if I wanted
to come help out on the film,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.989
and told me that it was
gonna be a horror film,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.790
and I absolutely
love horror films,

10:25.792 --> 10:28.126
so I couldn't pass it up.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.997
And yeah, I don't really
know what I'm doing,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.131
but I'm learning a lot,

10:33.133 --> 10:35.066
so that's really really cool.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.268
I've done YouTube stuff,

10:37.270 --> 10:38.403
but I don't think that counts,

10:38.405 --> 10:40.805
and this is like
lights, and every--

10:43.242 --> 10:44.409
check this shit out. There's a
couple of old dudes back
there sittin on the porch

10:44.411 --> 10:46.711
straight out of
fuckin' deliverance.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.213
Get the camera.
-For the behind the scenes?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.881
-No, we're gonna shoot em'.
We're gonna shoot the movie.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.083
-Wait, really?
-Yeah, yeah, dude go.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.718
You've got nothin' to lose--
-they're not actors.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.086
-It's gonna awesome, dude.
Wait'll you see these guys.

10:55.088 --> 10:55.086
Get the camera.
-Alright.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.689
-So, this is how
this is gonna happen.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.691
I'm gonna call action,

10:59.693 --> 11:02.394
and then Derek here
is going to ask you

11:02.396 --> 11:06.231
for directions to a farm nearby,

11:06.233 --> 11:09.200
and we need you to tell us
to stay away from the farm.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.270
It's a bad place and
bad things happen.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.105
Just tell us to stay away.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.007
Sound good?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.242
-Yeah.
-Is this candid camera?

11:17.244 --> 11:18.810
Andrew: No, no sir,

11:18.812 --> 11:20.879
that show hasn't been
around for a long time.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.814
-We just want that
ominous dark feeling like,

11:22.816 --> 11:25.316
"oh, we're goin' into a
bad place, stay away."

11:25.318 --> 11:28.420
-Right, sound good?
-Yeah, okay.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.755
Andrew: Alright, here we go,
we're gonna give this a shot.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.691
And action.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.259
Derek: Hey, we're
lookin', do you guys know

11:34.261 --> 11:37.429
how to get to like the old
buford farm out there?

11:37.431 --> 11:40.331
-Yeah I do, you go
down this way to the y,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.433
and you take a left--

11:41.435 --> 11:43.301
Andrew: Cut, cut!

11:43.303 --> 11:45.103
Okay, thank you.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.806
So... we need you to tell
us to stay away from there.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.441
-You don't really
want the directions.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.942
Andrew: That's
right, that's right.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.044
-We want it to be
like a warning.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.446
We say, "how do you get there?"

11:54.448 --> 11:56.815
And you're like,
"you stay away from there."

11:56.817 --> 11:58.416
-Yeah, I got you now.

11:58.418 --> 12:03.354
-Alrighty, we still slated,
speed, and... action.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.023
Derek: Good afternoon.
-Yeah, howdy.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.758
Derek: Do you guys know

12:06.760 --> 12:08.326
-you don't wanna go

12:08.328 --> 12:10.195
- cut, cut!

12:10.197 --> 12:12.197
I'm sorry, he just needs to be
able to get the question out.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.465
- Oh yeah.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.200
Andrew: Yeah, alright,
so we'll take this again.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.335
All set, and action.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.303
Derek: Good afternoon.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.771
-Afternoon.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.072
-Do you know how to get,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.440
we're trying to find
old man buford's place,

12:22.442 --> 12:23.742
I think, that's out there?

12:23.744 --> 12:25.009
-Yeah, I know how to find it.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.811
It's out there.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.348
And you don't wanna
go out there.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.518
- Woooooo! -
Why not?

12:33.520 --> 12:37.388
-Why not go out there?
I'll tell you why not...

12:37.390 --> 12:39.257
Bad things happen out there.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.859
- Yeah, bad things.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.095
-Alrighty, and cut.

12:44.097 --> 12:44.095
-Thank you guys.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.397
That is what we like
to call awesome.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.866
Amy: Thank you gentlemen.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.467
Derek: That was fantastic.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.436
-You guys are amazing.
One in a million.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.138
-Happy to help.
-Thank you guys.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.306
Amy: Thank you.
Lily: Sign the release form.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.875
-What kind of movie
did you say this was?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.443
Lily: It's a horror film.

12:58.445 --> 13:02.514
-Oh really, and one of them,
what do they call them?

13:02.516 --> 13:04.516
Torture porns? Like saw?

13:04.518 --> 13:07.018
Mark: No, it's a ghost story.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.422
-Yeah, it's found footage.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.424
-And you're filming
here in Gonzales?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.560
Mark: A little ways away.

13:15.562 --> 13:19.931
It's an old place
off of route 12.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.267
-You're not talking about
old Rufus Mitchell's place

13:22.269 --> 13:23.968
up there on the lake, are you?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.838
Mark: Yeah, i
guess, I think so.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.173
-No, no, no.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.843
You don't go to that place.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.845
No.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.183
-Okay, thank you.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.951
Have a great day.

13:41.120 --> 13:41.119
That was weird.

13:41.121 --> 13:45.957
-Wait a second, are you
saying that the place

13:45.959 --> 13:48.359
we're actually going
to is haunted?

13:50.196 --> 13:58.102
-No, it's not actually haunted.

13:58.104 --> 14:03.174
-Stories, what stories?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.210
-Okay, so then it is haunted.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.178
I mean... that's how a
haunted place gets--

14:07.180 --> 14:09.013
-no, it's just like old family

14:09.015 --> 14:10.448
superstition bullshit
or whatever.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.150
-Everything you're saying
makes it sound worse.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.953
I'm just saying, you know,
you've got young people

14:14.955 --> 14:16.221
who have never been
on a movie set,

14:16.223 --> 14:18.056
and you're bringing them out...

14:18.058 --> 14:20.291
You don't bring a film
crew to a haunted house

14:20.293 --> 14:22.060
to film a horror movie.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.229
Have you not seen, like...
Every horror movie ever?

14:24.231 --> 14:27.131
-Dude, it's just old
local kid scary stories

14:27.133 --> 14:29.467
that they try to spook
themselves with.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.569
-Kids? Those are the oldest
kids I've ever seen in my life.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.471
Those were not kids
telling us a story.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.506
The fucking cast of
cocoon is freaked out

14:35.508 --> 14:39.043
by this place, right?
So it's just not cool

14:39.045 --> 14:41.412
is all I'm saying, because you
know, she's freaked out now,

14:41.414 --> 14:42.947
and it's just not
cool to do that.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.049
That's it.

14:45.985 --> 14:46.951
Not cool.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.624
Derek: Yep.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.392
Andrew: This is us?

14:54.394 --> 14:57.595
Derek: This is us, I believe.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.001
Andrew: Mark, you're
getting all this, yeah?

15:05.537 --> 15:06.938
Derek: Oh shit, there it is.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.444
Andrew: Holy shit.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.180
Carl: Are you serious?

15:16.182 --> 15:17.215
Lily: Oh, it looks so cool.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.917
Andrew: Holy shit.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.084
Mark: Wow.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.452
Andrew: You first.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.390
-Whoa.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.491
Amy: This is crazy!

15:29.094 --> 15:30.361
Amy: Wow, this is great.

15:32.331 --> 15:33.231
Derek: Nope.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.699
Mark: Nothing?

15:34.701 --> 15:37.302
-We have status zero on the
electricity at the moment.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.003
Lily: Look at this old piano.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.239
Derek: Oh my god, no way.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.417
-Whoo!

15:54.954 --> 16:01.125
That's cool.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.127
Amy: No,
i don't think so.

16:05.397 --> 16:09.434
Derek: Wow, it's just
like somebody... left it.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.670
Lily: Ugh, look
at this fridge.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.305
Oh god, oh.

16:15.674 --> 16:16.708
It smells bad.

16:16.710 --> 16:17.575
Carl: That smells horrible.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.010
-Oh shit.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.346
Derek: Wow.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.448
Amy, well done.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.184
Lily: What's that?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.552
Mark: Hmm?

16:27.554 --> 16:28.586
Lily: What's that?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.755
Andrew: What's what?

16:30.757 --> 16:32.457
Carl: What is that?

16:33.692 --> 16:35.393
Andrew: Oh Jesus.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.496
Lily: Maybe it's just,
they spilled something?

16:40.199 --> 16:41.232
Carl: That's disturbing.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.066
Andrew: It's not a spill.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.701
Whoa, we got light.

16:46.038 --> 16:52.377
-Found the breaker!

16:52.379 --> 16:53.311
Derek: What, the chair?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.046
Carl: No no no.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.581
Mark: No, the stain.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.550
Derek: What? I mean,
it's an old place.

16:59.552 --> 17:03.621
It's gonna have some
stains and stuff.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.156
Nothing.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.656
There's a bunch of weird
stuff around, look,

17:06.659 --> 17:07.692
there's water stains there.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.218
Mark: Carl?

17:36.289 --> 17:37.488
Hey Carl?

17:38.190 --> 17:38.723
Carl?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.425
Carl: What? What?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.659
Mark: Do you hear that?

17:41.661 --> 17:43.428
Carl: Hear what?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.629
Mark: Shh. Listen.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.436
Carl: What the fuck is that?

17:54.606 --> 17:56.240
Mark: I don't know, but
where's your sound gear?

18:13.325 --> 18:13.324
Carl: It's moving.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.693
Whatever it is, it's
fucking moving.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.195
Mark: Moving?

18:17.796 --> 18:19.097
Lily: What are
you guys doing?

18:19.099 --> 18:20.498
Mark: Shh.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.567
Lily: What are you doing?

18:22.569 --> 18:23.801
Mark: Shh, listen.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.705
Andrew: What's goin' on?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.241
Carl: Some creepy fuckin'
sounds is what's goin' on.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.709
Andrew: That's fine,
shit, it's country noises,

18:31.711 --> 18:32.743
just go back to sleep.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.752
Carl: That was not a
fuckin' country noise!

18:41.754 --> 18:43.221
Andrew: No, no it wasn't.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.192
Lily: What are
you doing, Andrew?

18:48.194 --> 18:50.294
Carl: Hey, what
are you doin'?

18:50.296 --> 18:52.430
Andrew: It's fine,
don't worry about it.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.700
Carl: You don't
go investigate!

18:55.702 --> 18:56.667
Have fun out there.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.802
Andrew: Mark.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.171
Lily: Shh, you
guys aren't seriously

19:00.173 --> 19:01.572
going out there are you?

19:01.574 --> 19:05.243
Mark: Yeah, I guess
he wants me to film

19:05.245 --> 19:06.811
our last moments for posterity.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.887
Andrew: Stay close.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.297
Fuck, fuck!

19:26.299 --> 19:26.297
Mark: What?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.833
Andrew: Was that a deer?
It was a deer, dude.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.878
Mark: Awe man.

19:40.880 --> 19:46.184
Andrew: Dude, Jesus,
what the fuck was that?

19:46.186 --> 19:49.387
Awe fuck, man.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.321
Mark: What was that?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.389
Andrew: Hello?!

19:51.391 --> 19:52.323
Mark: Andrew?

19:54.293 --> 19:56.594
Andrew: Okay,
okay, okay, shh, shh.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.632
Jesus.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.235
Oh no.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.805
Oh come on, fuck.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.308
Oh come on, man, come on.

20:11.678 --> 20:15.713
Andrew: What the fuck is
that? What the fuck is that?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.615
Aww!

20:17.617 --> 20:18.916
Shit!

20:19.685 --> 20:20.551
What the fuck? Derek?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.286
-Ow. Dammit.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.257
Oh fuck, you broke it.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.491
Andrew: We broke it?

20:27.493 --> 20:28.559
-Yeah, look at it.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.560
Jesus Christ.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.264
Did you guys hear
those creepy sounds?

20:33.266 --> 20:33.898
Andrew: That's very cute,

20:33.900 --> 20:33.898
that's very cute.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.401
-Hey, don't tell
anybody else, okay?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.870
This is our little
creepy secret, alright?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.606
I just wanna set the
vibe for the shoot.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.641
Get the tone right, okay?

20:43.643 --> 20:46.777
Andrew: That's
terrific, cute.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.580
-Hey, the first scare is
always a false scare, right?.

21:00.826 --> 21:01.826
Lily: Did that come out

21:01.828 --> 21:03.427
Derek: It sure did.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.862
A little maple syrup stain.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.935
-Hi mark.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.708
Lily: My arm's
about to fall off.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.443
-It doesn't feel heavy at
first, does it, but then...?

21:19.445 --> 21:20.711
Lily: Uh-uh.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.015
-There it is.

21:24.017 --> 21:26.450
-Okay, good, you guys getting
the editing bay set up?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.586
-These are so gross.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.594
Jesus!

21:37.896 --> 21:40.031
-So, basically, the script was
written by myself and Derek.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.532
-Uh..
-What?

21:41.534 --> 21:44.035
-Nope, nothin', nevermind.

21:44.037 --> 21:45.403
-No, what?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.571
-No, it's just, i
mean, you came up with

21:47.573 --> 21:48.806
the back story for
your character.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.976
-I wrote several
finished scenes.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.578
-You tweaked some of what
i had already written.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.747
-Can we not do this
on camera please?

21:56.749 --> 22:00.718
-Anyway, so yes, we
play a husband and wife

22:00.720 --> 22:02.620
who come out to this
cabin in central Texas

22:02.622 --> 22:04.822
that she inherited
from her great uncle--

22:04.824 --> 22:09.627
-and my character is a
documentarian, a 3D enthusiast,

22:09.629 --> 22:13.798
and I work too hard so my
wife resents me for it,

22:13.800 --> 22:17.435
and with our relationship on
the verge of disintegrating

22:17.437 --> 22:19.704
we come out here to reconnect.

22:19.706 --> 22:23.474
-But of course, they find
more than they bargained for.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.642
Andrew: Really,
the way I see it,

22:24.644 --> 22:26.043
it's as much about
the deterioration

22:26.045 --> 22:28.079
of their relationship as
it is about anything,

22:28.081 --> 22:29.980
you know, supernatural.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.949
The ghost, or the monster,

22:31.951 --> 22:36.087
whatever you wanna call it,
is a metaphor, although,

22:36.089 --> 22:39.090
there are rumors that the
house is actually haunted.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.926
Mark: Haunted by what?

22:41.928 --> 22:45.129
-So, apparently, the previous
owner of the house, who's--

22:45.131 --> 22:46.697
-my character's great uncle.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.999
-Yes, he murdered his wife,

22:49.001 --> 22:52.470
and then dumped the body in
the lake behind the cabin.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.537
-So, there's a hint
that maybe there's--

22:53.539 --> 22:55.506
Carl: Wait, wait a second.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.042
This is a true story, isn't it?

23:00.612 --> 23:02.913
For real? Seriously guys,

23:02.915 --> 23:04.915
you brought us to a
cabin that's haunted

23:04.917 --> 23:06.150
in the middle
of the woods

23:06.152 --> 23:07.785
where a husband
murdered his wife

23:07.787 --> 23:10.054
to shoot a movie about a
husband murdering his wife

23:10.056 --> 23:11.455
at a haunted cabin in the woods?

23:11.457 --> 23:12.823
-Yep, yep.

23:12.825 --> 23:13.791
Carl: For reals?

23:13.793 --> 23:17.695
-Yeah.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.597
-Do you mind if we actually
do the interview, Carl?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.565
Carl: Sure, no, go ahead.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.033
-Pull up your pants.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.969
-Seriously, though... am i
being a big wuss about all this?

23:24.971 --> 23:26.971
-Um...

23:26.973 --> 23:28.806
-I actually believe
in all that stuff.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.174
I've seen a ghost.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.743
-For real?
-Yeah.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.578
When I was a little kid.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.147
Right hand to god.

23:36.149 --> 23:39.850
That's something you don't
ever really forget, you know?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.686
And what is this by the way?

23:42.688 --> 23:45.456
Are we suddenly a
British production?

23:45.458 --> 23:47.725
The spec-tre of death.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.460
Are we gonna see this
movie in the the-atre?

23:49.462 --> 23:51.495
-Yeah, it's
terrifying actually.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.531
I was reading it at night,

23:53.533 --> 23:56.867
which is a big
mistake, and yeah,

23:56.869 --> 24:00.571
I had nightmares, really
really awful nightmares.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.174
So I guess it's doing what
it's supposed to be doing.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.943
-Because we want them
to establish morning,

24:05.945 --> 24:07.711
so I think the natural
light works here.

24:07.713 --> 24:08.946
-I think this will be great.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.214
-Carl, does it work for you?

24:10.216 --> 24:12.750
-Hmm, the fridge is
gonna be a problem.

24:12.752 --> 24:12.750
Andrew: Why?

24:12.752 --> 24:17.588
-The hum. We'll have to
unplug it during shooting.

24:17.590 --> 24:20.524
-So, in every
found footage film,

24:20.526 --> 24:22.026
we have to answer two questions,

24:22.028 --> 24:23.861
the first of which is
"why are we filming?"

24:23.863 --> 24:26.096
"What excuse do we
have for having

24:26.098 --> 24:27.798
a camera document everything?"

24:27.800 --> 24:29.533
That's usually answered
pretty early in the movie,

24:29.535 --> 24:29.533
usually the first scene,

24:29.535 --> 24:32.102
which we're actually
about to do right now.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.038
Mark: And the
second question?

24:34.040 --> 24:35.573
-The second question
is exactly the same

24:35.575 --> 24:37.208
as the first question
but for the third act.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.810
It's usually "why the fuck
haven't you put the camera down,

24:39.812 --> 24:41.545
and run the hell away?"

24:41.547 --> 24:42.880
If you answer that one wrong,

24:42.882 --> 24:45.082
the whole third act just
completely falls apart.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.853
Mark: So, can you give
us a preview to the answer?

24:48.855 --> 24:50.821
- Actually
no, not at the moment.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.089
Mark: Why not?

24:52.091 --> 24:53.624
-There's no ending.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.560
It actually stops
dead on page 71

24:57.863 --> 24:59.530
in the middle of a scene.

24:59.532 --> 25:02.533
I don't know if he has
an ending in mind,

25:02.535 --> 25:04.935
you know, if he's just
trying to keep it secret

25:04.937 --> 25:06.871
like they do in the
big tentpole movies,

25:06.873 --> 25:09.740
the ones that people actually
give a shit about seeing.

25:09.742 --> 25:13.177
-Yeah, no, we don't have
an ending right now,

25:13.179 --> 25:15.613
but that's okay.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.281
I mean, hey, worked on
apocalypse now, right?

25:17.283 --> 25:19.183
What?

25:19.185 --> 25:20.217
-Really?

25:21.753 --> 25:23.821
Coppola?
-Yeah.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.056
-You're comparing
yourself to coppola?

25:30.161 --> 25:31.862
-He doesn't have an ending.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.164
It's great, no, it's
good, it's good.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.233
I don't mind, I do, well, hmm.

25:36.235 --> 25:40.104
-Oh, oh, yeah, that
makes sense now.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.006
-I'm gonna do it like this
so you can see my profile.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.707
-Here we go, spectre of death,

25:43.709 --> 25:46.176
we're about to shoot the very
first scene of our movie.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.978
Scene one, take one.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.647
Action!

25:50.315 --> 25:51.081
-That's good, right?

25:53.286 --> 25:54.618
Derek: Oh, she loves it.

25:55.821 --> 25:56.787
This woman loves cleaning,

25:56.789 --> 25:57.988
she can't stop cleaning.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.657
Thank you Derek, for
bringing me to a dirty

25:59.659 --> 26:01.058
old cabin in the woods.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.626
-Thank you Derek for
bringing me to a dirty

26:02.628 --> 26:03.961
old cabin in the woods.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.563
Derek: You're
welcome, anytime.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.630
-Babe?

26:06.632 --> 26:06.630
Derek: Yes.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.732
-You promised you
weren't going to bring

26:08.734 --> 26:09.667
that stupid camera.

26:09.669 --> 26:09.667
Derek: Whoopsy.

26:09.669 --> 26:09.667
-We're supposed
to be on vacation.

26:09.669 --> 26:13.671
Derek: I know, we
are on vacation though.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.973
This is in fact our
vacation video.

26:15.975 --> 26:19.243
This is you, this is
the sink, this is us.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.344
-It has absolutely
nothing to do

26:20.346 --> 26:22.212
with that stupid ghost--

26:22.214 --> 26:23.714
Andrew: Sorry, wait,
cut for a second.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.583
Derek: Yeah, we dropped that.

26:25.585 --> 26:25.583
Amy: What?

26:25.585 --> 26:25.583
-We don't have that.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.218
Andrew: Did you
not get the changes?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.587
-No, what changes?

26:29.589 --> 26:31.855
-Lily gave you the
pages yesterday, no?

26:31.857 --> 26:35.593
-I left them on
your sleeping bag.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.597
-Well, you don't just leave
a script laying around,

26:39.599 --> 26:40.764
and hope that people see it.

26:40.766 --> 26:40.764
Mark: I'm sorry.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.901
-You hand them to
the actor personally.

26:43.903 --> 26:43.901
Derek: Fair
enough, that's okay,

26:43.903 --> 26:46.303
we can solve it
now, we have 'em.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.338
-I didn't wanna wake you up.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.339
Andrew: It's fine, it's fine.

26:48.341 --> 26:49.773
Amy: Well, I didn't get them.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.108
Andrew: Can you just
look over it real fast?

26:51.110 --> 26:52.776
-Sure, sure, sure.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.679
-We are rebooting scene
one. We'll do a reboot,

26:55.681 --> 26:57.047
and then take it from the top.

26:58.717 --> 26:59.917
-Hmm.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.786
No, this is no good.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.054
Andrew: Okay,
what's the matter?

27:04.056 --> 27:06.123
-Well, the writing
sucks, for one.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.625
-Eh, Amy, what are you?

27:07.627 --> 27:08.726
There's nothin' wrong
with the scene.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.894
-Well, I wrote
the scene the way

27:10.896 --> 27:12.262
that I wrote it for a reason.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.864
Structurally, we need
to establish the

27:13.866 --> 27:15.199
"before" of their relationship--

27:15.201 --> 27:16.634
-i know, but we
also need to show

27:16.636 --> 27:17.801
that there's a little
bit of conflict--

27:17.803 --> 27:17.801
-we need to show
that we're in love.

27:17.803 --> 27:17.801
-I know, and in that
love there is conflict.

27:17.803 --> 27:17.801
That is part of what's
gonna happen later.

27:17.803 --> 27:22.873
-Okay, well, you have us
screaming at each other

27:22.875 --> 27:22.873
for two solid pages.

27:22.875 --> 27:22.873
-I don't have us
screaming at each other,

27:22.875 --> 27:26.410
I just have us butting
heads a little bit.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.711
-A little bit? We have
exclamation points

27:27.713 --> 27:28.879
at the end of every sentence.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.914
-Exclamation points
are just emphasis

27:30.916 --> 27:32.349
for the conflict that's coming.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.151
It's the soul of
drama, that's all.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.720
-The soul of drama?
That's super cute, Derek.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.055
Did you get that
out of one of your

27:38.057 --> 27:39.790
$12 Internet screening
writing courses?

27:39.792 --> 27:41.225
-You know, I don't exactly
need to take a course

27:41.227 --> 27:43.360
to write a scene where you
act like a total bitch, do I?

27:43.362 --> 27:45.729
-Guys, guys, guys. -
Hmm, this is typical,

27:45.731 --> 27:47.231
this is so typical, Derek James.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.334
You can't even pretend to be
in love with me, can you?

27:50.336 --> 27:51.702
-Well, I did it for four years.

27:58.309 --> 28:00.310
You gonna cry now?

28:00.312 --> 28:03.280
Yeah, okay, I did it,
i stepped on a landmine,

28:03.282 --> 28:06.684
here come the crocodile tears.
Everybody give her attention.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.085
-How could you even
say that to me?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.253
-Oh what, now it's
all my fuckin' fault.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.421
Is this the same
bullshit we go to?

28:10.423 --> 28:11.855
Mark: D-d-Derek.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.791
-Du-du-du! If you got
somethin' to say mark,

28:13.793 --> 28:15.826
why don't you spit
it the fuck out?!

28:15.828 --> 28:17.094
No?

28:19.197 --> 28:21.965
Andrew: Okay, let's all
take a deep breath, it's hot.

28:23.768 --> 28:25.335
Let's just cool off here.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.405
Amy, it's a few small changes.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.040
If you could just look
it over real fast,

28:30.042 --> 28:31.809
and just, we'll give
you two minutes.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.143
Derek: You know
what, fuck it.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.813
Nevermind, we will
shoot it her way.

28:35.815 --> 28:36.780
-Alright, are you sure?

28:36.782 --> 28:38.449
-Yes, I am absolutely positive.

28:38.451 --> 28:39.983
-Okay.

28:39.985 --> 28:41.819
-My wife says we are in
love, we are in love.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.020
Mark: Three,
two, one, action.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.794
Derek: Hey sweetheart,
see my new camera?

28:50.796 --> 28:52.262
You are in 3D.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.166
Reach for the camera,
do it like this, whoo.

28:59.871 --> 29:01.371
-Day one.

29:03.074 --> 29:06.076
-It's been awhile since I've
been on a set like this.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.277
Mark: What do you mean?

29:07.279 --> 29:10.447
-Well, normally,
i work on bigger,

29:10.449 --> 29:13.317
more professional productions.

29:13.319 --> 29:16.320
I turned down a Ben
affleck movie to be here.

29:16.322 --> 29:17.187
Mark: Really?

29:17.189 --> 29:18.856
-Mmm-hmm, really.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.057
Mark: Why?

29:21.426 --> 29:24.962
-Well, Derek helped
me out a few years ago

29:24.964 --> 29:26.530
financially when I needed that,

29:26.532 --> 29:29.533
and I'm returning
the favor, so...

29:33.204 --> 29:35.305
Plus, I fuckin'
hate Ben affleck.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.808
-There's a definite
shorthand, I think,

29:37.810 --> 29:39.810
when you're working
with someone so closely

29:39.812 --> 29:41.812
that you know so well.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.915
There's a chemistry
and a history

29:44.917 --> 29:48.385
that sort of lends itself
to the script, I think.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.488
Mark: Are you worried
about all the fighting

29:51.490 --> 29:53.957
you're going to have to
do later on in the shoot?

29:53.959 --> 29:55.926
-No, no, absolutely not.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.395
We're both professionals.

29:58.397 --> 30:02.332
This is acting, it's
just pretending.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.501
Mark: Okay, thank
you, I think we got it.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.303
-Great.

30:09.941 --> 30:13.410
-Ah, Mr. mark here.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.045
-Mark, do you ever
put that thing down?

30:15.047 --> 30:16.280
Mark: Yes.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.314
Andrew: Do you?

30:17.316 --> 30:20.217
Mark: Yeah, I do. To sleep.

30:20.219 --> 30:20.217
-There's peanut
butter jelly sandwich,

30:20.219 --> 30:23.120
peanut butter jelly
sandwich, I wanted to die.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.454
-Peanut butter's good.

30:24.456 --> 30:28.592
-Yeah, have it fuckin'
35 times in two weeks.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.127
-I have it for
breakfast every morning.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.196
-Okay, are you a peasant?

30:32.198 --> 30:34.498
--Running for their lives
from whatever it is,

30:34.500 --> 30:38.402
not just start beating
whatever is chasing

30:38.404 --> 30:40.537
them to death with the camera.

30:40.539 --> 30:40.537
-It's like war journalists,

30:40.539 --> 30:44.975
they stay there while
the bombs are going off,

30:44.977 --> 30:46.276
while bullets are
flying over their head,

30:46.278 --> 30:47.878
and they keep filming,

30:47.880 --> 30:48.879
they keep filming in the moment.

30:48.881 --> 30:49.947
Why don't they just run?

30:49.949 --> 30:52.316
Because they gotta keep filming.

30:52.318 --> 30:55.219
Carl: Yeah, they're
also well paid.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.153
Andrew: Why do
we keep watching?

30:56.155 --> 30:58.622
Why do we keep watching?

30:58.624 --> 31:02.860
And between the two
mediums, found footage,

31:02.862 --> 31:07.064
and you know, war,
in both scenarios,

31:07.066 --> 31:08.866
it's fucked up, but
in both scenarios

31:08.868 --> 31:11.134
I know a majority of
them aren't coming home.

31:11.136 --> 31:14.271
I know that those guys very
well might die in the war,

31:14.273 --> 31:16.506
and we know that everyone's
dying in found footage.

31:36.928 --> 31:37.995
-Okay...

31:38.930 --> 31:41.498
Hey, spectre of death fans.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.535
I don't have Wi-Fi or Internet,

31:45.537 --> 31:48.272
so I won't be able to
upload this anytime soon.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.940
Maybe when we go into town.

31:50.975 --> 31:56.914
But I just wanted to document
something a little weird

31:56.916 --> 32:00.584
that I found in some of
the footage from today.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.654
I'm not making this
up, this is real,

32:03.656 --> 32:06.556
it's not part of the movie,

32:06.558 --> 32:10.394
at least not as far as I know.

32:15.166 --> 32:16.366
-I did it, I stepped
on the landmine,

32:16.368 --> 32:18.201
here come the crocodile tears.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.469
-There.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.239
See that?

32:24.375 --> 32:25.676
It's sort of in the...

32:28.646 --> 32:30.580
I don't know maybe it's nothing,

32:30.582 --> 32:37.154
but I definitely don't
remember anything or anyone

32:38.323 --> 32:41.024
being there this afternoon
when we were shooting.

32:41.026 --> 32:44.061
Plus--and this is
the weirdest part--

32:44.063 --> 32:45.629
whatever it is--

32:50.134 --> 32:51.702
again?

32:53.171 --> 32:54.338
Jesus, Derek. Give it a rest.

33:33.277 --> 33:36.446
I guess that was a
real animal that time

33:36.448 --> 33:39.750
because Derek's still in his
sleeping bag in the other...

33:49.761 --> 33:51.495
O-Kay...

33:52.430 --> 33:54.698
That's super weird.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.045
Andrew: Guys, please
be careful of snakes.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.547
Amy: Snakes?

34:10.549 --> 34:12.081
Andrew: Mark's how's this
all showing up lighting wise?

34:12.083 --> 34:13.315
-This is good, right?

34:13.318 --> 34:15.385
Mark: Yeah, the
lighting's great.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.788
-In the trees, you know,
boom boom boom boom.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.489
Andrew: Oh yeah,
that's great.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.556
-Yeah, you see that?

34:20.559 --> 34:21.824
So, she's like, "fuck you!"

34:21.827 --> 34:24.061
Boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.495
Spectre flashes.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.264
Amy: Okay, okay.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.534
-So, today we have the first
appearance of the spectre.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.471
Mark: Which is?

34:34.473 --> 34:37.306
-The villain of the movie,
the ghost, or entity,

34:37.309 --> 34:40.409
or whatever that
inhabits the cabin.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.579
Mark: How do you plan
on doing the spectre?

34:42.581 --> 34:44.547
-Well, I wanted to do
it as a practical effect

34:44.550 --> 34:44.547
because I think--

34:44.550 --> 34:47.350
-a guy in a spectre suit
would look retarded.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.719
-Yes, well bad cg will
look more retarded.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.655
-Who says it's gonna be bad cg?

34:51.657 --> 34:54.291
-We can't afford good cg.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.859
We'll find out.

34:56.627 --> 34:58.395
Derek: I'm sorry, i
kicked it in the river.

34:58.397 --> 34:58.395
-You kicked it in the river?

34:58.397 --> 35:00.664
-I didn't mean to
kick it in the river,

35:00.666 --> 35:00.664
it just fell in the river.

35:00.666 --> 35:00.664
It fell in the river when
i was trying to get lunch.

35:00.666 --> 35:05.469
Amy: So, we don't have a map?
Derek: We don't have a map,

35:05.471 --> 35:06.770
we're a little bit
lost right now,

35:06.772 --> 35:06.770
but it can't be that hard--

35:06.772 --> 35:06.770
-I'll just lead the
way, don't worry.

35:06.772 --> 35:10.440
Derek: You can't lead the
way if you don't know

35:10.442 --> 35:12.242
where you're going.
-Oh my god!

35:12.677 --> 35:13.610
How was that?

35:13.612 --> 35:13.610
Derek: Um...

35:13.612 --> 35:16.746
Mark: What would you
say the spectre is?

35:16.748 --> 35:18.815
-I don't know, and i
don't think I wanna know.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.517
I mean, I have my ideas.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.519
I think everybody's
gonna have their ideas,

35:22.521 --> 35:25.722
but I kind of hope that they
don't wrap it up neatly.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.725
-I would say that the
spectre is probably

35:28.727 --> 35:32.596
the fictional couple's
own negative energy

35:33.698 --> 35:35.665
that's physically manifested,

35:35.667 --> 35:39.569
like maybe their
relationship dysfunction

35:39.571 --> 35:43.240
is so big and horrible
for everyone around them

35:43.242 --> 35:45.542
that it has actually
ripped open a hole

35:45.544 --> 35:47.477
to the gateway of hell.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.146
-So I think if
we put it here...

35:49.148 --> 35:50.547
What do you think?

35:50.549 --> 35:50.547
-Absolutely, yeah, because
we wanna be able to have

35:50.549 --> 35:53.583
people come through the door,
and the fridge will block that,

35:53.585 --> 35:54.684
and I think that's good.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.621
-The only problem
here is that I think

35:57.623 --> 35:59.356
this is where the
whole 3D part kind of

35:59.358 --> 36:00.624
falls apart a little bit.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.928
-What do you mean the
3D thing falls apart?

36:04.930 --> 36:04.928
-Well, when the
audience is watching the

36:04.930 --> 36:07.430
surveillance footage it's
not gonna make sense

36:07.432 --> 36:09.366
to them if it's not in 3D.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.268
-Yeah, but why
wouldn't it be in 3D?

36:11.270 --> 36:12.536
What do you mean it's not in 3D?

36:12.538 --> 36:13.737
-Well, I mean, that
won't make sense.

36:13.739 --> 36:13.737
-What won't make sense?

36:13.739 --> 36:17.374
-There's no such thing as
a 3D surveillance camera.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.575
-We don't know that.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.210
-No, I do, I looked it up.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.745
-Okay, well, there should be.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.581
-Agreed, but there's not.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.349
-Okay, you know what,
do you have two gopros?

36:26.351 --> 36:27.584
-I have several.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.186
-Great, take two,
stick em' together,

36:29.188 --> 36:31.521
left eye, right eye,
stereo, 3D, boom,

36:31.523 --> 36:32.722
that's your problem solved.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.291
-I mean, I get it,
i just think you're

36:34.293 --> 36:34.291
missing the point a little bit.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.761
-What I think you're doing
is pissing in the pool again,

36:37.763 --> 36:39.262
don't over think it.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.531
Audiences, stupid, you,
making it happen, 3D.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.300
-Okay, fair enough,
I'll give it a shot.

36:59.917 --> 37:02.686
This might actually work.

37:02.688 --> 37:03.787
It's a ridiculous idea,

37:03.789 --> 37:05.855
but it might actually work.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.490
Sweet.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.730
Mark: Just talk about
what makes shooting

37:13.732 --> 37:16.800
a found footage movie
different from shooting--

37:16.802 --> 37:18.668
-a real movie?

37:20.004 --> 37:22.572
Basically, the task in
a found footage movie

37:22.574 --> 37:24.507
is to take really good sound,

37:24.509 --> 37:26.977
and make it sound as
shitty as possible.

37:26.979 --> 37:30.880
And just job well done on that.

37:30.882 --> 37:30.880
-I mean, that's
the thing right,

37:30.882 --> 37:33.717
with found footage you
don't need to worry about

37:33.719 --> 37:35.919
lights, and grips,
and all that crap.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.556
You can just go out in the
woods, shoot the movie,

37:39.558 --> 37:41.625
and it's brilliant because
you get away with it,

37:41.627 --> 37:43.593
and it makes you look
like the genius.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.894
Oh, we're just running
around with a camera,

37:44.896 --> 37:46.363
we don't know what we're doing,

37:46.365 --> 37:47.664
and so it's like, "well,
the light's crap,

37:47.666 --> 37:49.332
"and the sound's crap."

37:49.334 --> 37:53.603
Be like, "exactly, but guess
who's paying for it? Boom."

37:53.605 --> 37:54.771
We shouldn't use that one.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.539
-It is different, definitely,

37:56.541 --> 37:59.042
but I think ultimately
all acting is about

37:59.044 --> 38:01.611
finding the truth in the moment.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.913
Whether that's improving
for a found footage film

38:03.915 --> 38:06.283
or belting out a
Broadway musical, i--

38:10.021 --> 38:12.389
okay, let's
take that again.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.890
Mark: Oh, okay, yeah, sure.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.027
Whenever you're ready.

38:17.029 --> 38:20.597
-Yes, it is different
i will say that--

38:24.669 --> 38:28.672
mark: Hey guys, we're
doing an interview.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.573
Derek: Awesome, keep it up.

38:30.575 --> 38:31.808
-You know what, sweetheart,

38:31.810 --> 38:34.678
why don't we just do
this another time.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.980
Mark: Yeah, sure.

38:42.953 --> 38:45.889
-So, Amy and I come in, she's
talking about her uncle,

38:47.458 --> 38:49.559
though she's being
cagey and evasive,

38:49.561 --> 38:50.827
not telling me the whole story,

38:50.829 --> 38:52.896
then she hints at the
ominous back story of it.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.497
We get to like right over there,

38:54.499 --> 38:55.532
I think right where Lily is,

38:55.534 --> 38:56.499
and that's when
the shovel falls,

38:56.501 --> 38:58.468
almost hits Amy in the head.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.536
Audience jumps out
of their seat.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.372
Lily: Nice.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.641
I love it when things do that.

39:04.643 --> 39:07.944
-Like a cat? Is
it a "pop scare"?

39:07.946 --> 39:09.079
Amy: It's called
a jump scare!

39:09.081 --> 39:10.814
It's called a jump scare,

39:10.816 --> 39:12.115
and I think it's
probably one of the most

39:12.117 --> 39:13.683
overused cliches
in horror movies.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.818
-That's why we're using it.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.052
-You might as well
just have a cat.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.654
-We don't have a fuckin'
cat, we have a shovel.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.522
-No, I think it's
lazy filmmaking,

39:19.524 --> 39:21.391
Andrew, I think you would agree.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.393
It's bad writing done by hacks

39:23.395 --> 39:24.661
who can't even write a script

39:24.663 --> 39:26.396
that unsettles on
a deeper level.

39:26.398 --> 39:26.396
You know what, actually,
it's meant to appease

39:26.398 --> 39:29.866
audience members who are just
too stupid to know better.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.134
-Okay.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.469
Amy: I don't
think it's worth it.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.670
Derek: We need to
have some kind of

39:33.672 --> 39:34.971
moment where it snaps.

39:36.107 --> 39:36.106
-That's not really,
that's not a fair thing

39:36.108 --> 39:43.012
for you to say to me, okay. I
mean, what did I ever--

39:44.850 --> 39:47.617
Derek: Jesus! Shit,
oh my god!

39:47.619 --> 39:51.788
Carl: Lily? Lily?
Oh my god, Lily?

39:51.790 --> 39:54.157
Derek: Is she okay?
Carl: No, no, don't.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.159
Derek: Lily are you okay?
Carl: Hey, answer Lily.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.695
Do you hear us?
Do you hear us?

39:58.697 --> 40:00.096
Okay, okay.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.464
No, no, don't move
your head around.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.732
Don't move your head around.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.769
Listen, who am I?
Who am I?

40:05.771 --> 40:07.103
It's okay, it's just
a little blood,

40:07.105 --> 40:08.471
don't worry about it.

40:08.473 --> 40:09.939
Andrew: She's bleeding.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.908
Carl: Hey, how many
fingers do I have up?

40:11.910 --> 40:14.077
-Two.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.780
Carl: Okay, what's your name?
-Lily.

40:16.782 --> 40:19.449
Carl: Okay, what's my name?
-Carl.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.084
Carl: Do you
know where you are?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.585
-Yeah.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.754
-Okay, look, let's
get you up slow.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.723
Sit up real slow,
okay, how's your neck?

40:26.725 --> 40:29.125
Here, go real slow, let me
hold your neck for you.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.994
Andrew: Oh Jesus.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.496
Carl: Okay, you dizzy?

40:33.498 --> 40:35.765
No, you're not dizzy?

40:35.767 --> 40:37.834
Okay, okay, put your
arm around me, come on.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.169
-Give me your other arm.

40:39.171 --> 40:40.703
Carl: That's good.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.044
Amy: I hope she's okay.

40:52.883 --> 40:56.186
-Derek, I don't care, if she
needs to go to the hospital--

40:56.188 --> 40:57.821
-i would take her.

40:58.757 --> 40:59.789
-Are you--

40:59.791 --> 41:01.157
-Lily, hey lil.

41:05.062 --> 41:08.531
Look at you, hey, should we
take you to the hospital?

41:08.533 --> 41:09.833
Andrew: Lily, be honest.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.234
-I'll take you, we'll
jump in the car right now

41:11.236 --> 41:13.002
if you need to go.
-No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.037
Derek: Yeah?

41:14.039 --> 41:15.138
Andrew: She's...

41:15.140 --> 41:16.573
Derek: You're a big trooper?

41:17.942 --> 41:19.876
-Alright, there we go.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.678
She's fine, it's just
a bump on the head.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.079
Carl: You sure you okay?

41:23.081 --> 41:26.583
You're okay? I mean, do
you have a headache?

41:26.585 --> 41:27.517
-Why don't you get some water?

41:27.519 --> 41:27.517
Carl: Huh?

41:27.519 --> 41:29.185
-Why don't you get some water?

41:29.187 --> 41:30.019
Carl: Okay.

41:30.021 --> 41:30.820
-Please.

41:34.225 --> 41:38.094
I don't know, I just,
i hope she's okay.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.096
She seems like a
really nice girl.

41:40.931 --> 41:42.765
-That was definitely weird.

41:42.767 --> 41:45.668
Not just me freakin'
out about nothing.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.537
That was, you know.

41:48.939 --> 41:48.938
-These things do happen.

41:48.940 --> 41:52.275
I mean, you talk to any
of the big directors,

41:52.277 --> 41:54.611
you know, you watch their
director's cuts like,

41:54.613 --> 41:55.645
shit happens people get hurt,

41:55.647 --> 41:56.813
they get banged up.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.815
The important thing
is she's okay,

41:58.817 --> 42:00.817
and we can keep moving forward.

42:00.819 --> 42:08.157
And, you know, not overreact.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.560
That's terrible.
It's true though.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.729
-It's just I don't know if it's
worth us stopping the flow

42:12.731 --> 42:14.264
of the story for
a full minute

42:14.266 --> 42:15.765
while you deliver the
third act exposition.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.000
-I'm not stopping the
flow of the story,

42:17.002 --> 42:17.000
I'm telling them
what's happening.

42:17.002 --> 42:17.000
We're letting the audience
know what's happened,

42:17.002 --> 42:21.170
so they're not confused when
they leave the theater.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.272
I was hoping for something

42:22.274 --> 42:23.740
a little bit more
ambiguous,

42:23.742 --> 42:23.740
let them have something
to talk about--

42:23.742 --> 42:23.740
-they're gonna be talking
about how great the movie is,

42:23.742 --> 42:28.945
not oh my god, I don't know
what the hell just happened.

42:28.947 --> 42:30.246
-We should be letting
them decide for themselves

42:30.248 --> 42:32.115
what the spectre is
instead of telling them.

42:32.117 --> 42:33.650
-Blair witch.

42:33.652 --> 42:34.851
-People are gonna
think we don't know

42:34.853 --> 42:36.085
what it is if we
don't tell them.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.620
"They don't even know
their own movie."

42:37.622 --> 42:38.788
-If we leave it vague,

42:38.790 --> 42:42.859
we can add to the
mythology if it.

42:42.861 --> 42:47.630
We can build on it in a sequel.

42:47.632 --> 42:48.765
-Charge them another ten bucks?

42:48.767 --> 42:50.066
-Sure.

42:51.201 --> 42:53.169
-Thirteen bucks, 3D.
-3D, that's right.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.872
-Imax. 15, fuck it, go big.
-Exactly.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.173
- Alright, I get it.

42:57.175 --> 43:01.711
Yes, okay, I will bring it in,

43:01.713 --> 43:03.046
make it a little more vague.

43:03.048 --> 43:04.747
-Okay, just do it
quickly, Derek,

43:04.749 --> 43:06.749
we have very little time left.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.184
-Oh, okay, thank you.

43:17.861 --> 43:19.662
Amy: You still awake too?

43:19.664 --> 43:24.367
Mark: Yeah, just
cutting together

43:25.669 --> 43:28.304
some footage for
the Facebook page.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.373
Amy: Mmm-hmm.

43:33.878 --> 43:34.978
-Please don't.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.112
-No, come on.

43:37.715 --> 43:40.083
It's only fair...
Watching the watcher.

43:47.292 --> 43:50.293
Nice, it's very... meta.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.133
So mark, how are you?

43:58.936 --> 44:01.638
You working on anything?

44:01.640 --> 44:04.374
-No, just this.

44:08.779 --> 44:11.714
Amy: I think you should
make another short.

44:11.716 --> 44:14.017
We should make a
short, you and me.

44:14.019 --> 44:16.052
-Uh, mmm, yeah.

44:17.287 --> 44:19.389
Amy: Okay, well don't
sound so enthusiastic.

44:19.391 --> 44:21.691
-No, no, no, that's not--

44:21.693 --> 44:23.092
-sweetheart, I'm
teasing, I know.

44:24.361 --> 44:25.962
It beats working
with Derek, anyway.

44:30.267 --> 44:34.103
I mean, i
don't know, I think,

44:35.272 --> 44:36.773
I know there's been
a lot of friction,

44:41.078 --> 44:44.280
but I don't know, maybe
there's something more.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.315
I think Derek and I are finally

44:46.317 --> 44:49.986
understanding each
other a little bit.

44:49.988 --> 44:51.721
Andrew: Well, we still
don't have our lead actress.

44:51.723 --> 44:53.790
Amy: What's this?

44:53.792 --> 44:55.458
Turn it up. -
That's nothing.

44:55.460 --> 44:56.893
Amy: No, turn
it up, turn it up.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.330
-Amy.

45:01.332 --> 45:02.432
Amy: No, come on, what is it?

45:02.434 --> 45:04.100
I wanna see it.

45:04.102 --> 45:06.102
Please.

45:06.104 --> 45:07.770
Andrew: Do you
want me to call her?

45:07.772 --> 45:09.238
Derek: Do whatever
the fuck you wanna do.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.173
Andrew: What does
that even mean?

45:10.175 --> 45:11.340
Mark: I'll call her.

45:11.342 --> 45:12.709
Andrew: Can you? Thank you.

45:12.711 --> 45:14.711
Andrew: It's just
gonna be a little tough

45:14.713 --> 45:16.479
to do the film without her.

45:16.481 --> 45:17.880
Derek: It's
gonna be a lot tough

45:17.882 --> 45:19.949
to do the film with
her, trust me.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.084
Should have my head examined

45:21.086 --> 45:22.452
for casting her in
the first place.

45:25.989 --> 45:27.824
Amy: Is that it?

45:27.826 --> 45:29.025
-Amy.

45:29.027 --> 45:30.226
Amy: Is that all he said?

45:30.228 --> 45:32.361
-I don't think that
this is something...

45:32.363 --> 45:34.864
Amy: Just play it.

45:34.866 --> 45:36.132
-Amy.

45:36.134 --> 45:38.501
Amy: Play it.

45:38.503 --> 45:40.737
Mark, play it.

45:42.372 --> 45:44.006
Derek: Just make sure
you erase that file, okay.

45:44.008 --> 45:45.842
Mark: Yes, when
i dump the cards.

45:45.844 --> 45:47.176
Derek: Alright.

45:47.178 --> 45:49.178
Mark: So, why did you anyway?

45:49.180 --> 45:50.146
Derek: Why did I what?

45:50.148 --> 45:51.814
Mark: Cast Amy.

45:51.816 --> 45:55.118
Derek: Because
I'm a fuckin' idiot.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.986
I signed a contract
before we were separated,

45:56.988 --> 45:59.388
and no thank you, I do
not want another lawsuit.

45:59.390 --> 46:00.790
Mark: So, you're
not trying to get

46:00.792 --> 46:02.458
back together with her?

46:02.460 --> 46:04.827
Derek: No, sweet
Jesus Christ,

46:04.829 --> 46:06.963
I am not trying to
get back together.

46:09.434 --> 46:11.367
Speaking of Satan incarnate.

46:20.077 --> 46:22.078
-I'm sorry.

46:25.549 --> 46:27.450
Amy: Me too.

46:30.420 --> 46:30.419
I don't know why I'm surprised.

46:34.491 --> 46:38.161
I mean, I'm being
an idiot right?

46:38.163 --> 46:39.962
It's over.

46:41.231 --> 46:42.932
Is it?

46:50.240 --> 46:51.374
What?

46:52.476 --> 46:53.910
-What?

46:55.045 --> 46:56.412
I...

46:57.281 --> 46:59.816
I'm sorry, what
was the question?

47:02.085 --> 47:06.222
Amy: Nevermind, I probably
don't wanna know anyway.

47:06.224 --> 47:08.391
Good night.

47:24.174 --> 47:27.577
-You are a fucking liar.
-I am not a liar, Amy!

47:27.579 --> 47:29.045
I live in the truth.

47:29.047 --> 47:30.379
It's you that makes up shit--

47:30.381 --> 47:32.381
-excuse me, if you could
keep it in your pants

47:32.383 --> 47:34.283
we would not even be here!

47:34.285 --> 47:35.985
-Oh really, you know why
i can't keep my pants,

47:35.987 --> 47:37.386
it's because you are
such a frigid bitch

47:37.388 --> 47:38.988
that I have no fuckin' place--
-fuck you!

47:40.625 --> 47:44.026
Oh my god, I'm so
sorry, are you okay?

47:44.028 --> 47:45.194
I'm so sorry, oh my god.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.229
-Amy, what are
you fuckin' doing?

47:46.231 --> 47:47.463
-I'm sorry--

47:47.465 --> 47:49.232
Andrew: Guys, guys, do
it again, take it again.

47:49.234 --> 47:50.566
-I know we got
the fuckin' take.

47:50.568 --> 47:53.069
Amy, we're right in the
middle of the scene!

47:53.071 --> 47:54.637
Do you not know how to
commit to the moment?

47:54.639 --> 47:56.639
Andrew: Take it again.
-No, I can't do this right now.

47:56.641 --> 47:58.975
-No, Amy please, use this
to fuel your emotions.

47:58.977 --> 48:01.143
-Yes, definitely,
actually acting, you know.

48:01.145 --> 48:02.078
Mark: Derek, Derek--

48:02.080 --> 48:03.546
-mark, shut the fuck up!

48:03.548 --> 48:06.048
Oh my god, listen, you
guys, thank you all

48:06.050 --> 48:08.351
for your help and suggestions,

48:08.353 --> 48:10.653
but please keep your
opinions to yourself

48:10.655 --> 48:11.153
unless you are asked, okay.

48:16.026 --> 48:18.160
Thank you, alright,
fine, let's go again.

48:18.162 --> 48:19.629
-No, I can't do this
right now, I just--

48:19.631 --> 48:21.998
-oh come on Amy, will
you grow the fuck up?

48:22.000 --> 48:23.532
This is the problem
every god damn time!

48:23.534 --> 48:25.501
It's an emotional
fucking roller coaster

48:25.503 --> 48:28.204
because you are not willing
to do it you fucking cunt!

48:28.206 --> 48:30.406
Every time we--

48:33.144 --> 48:34.944
-fuck!

48:43.553 --> 48:45.488
Andrew: You okay?

48:45.490 --> 48:47.290
-Andrew, what...?

48:50.093 --> 48:51.427
What just, what
the fuck happened?

48:52.129 --> 48:55.031
-I don't know, I have no idea.

48:55.033 --> 48:57.667
-Did you arm the gag?

48:57.669 --> 49:01.971
-No, no, no, I turned
it off before we,

49:01.973 --> 49:03.306
right when we said cut.

49:03.308 --> 49:03.306
I think I did.

49:03.308 --> 49:05.274
-I mean, why the fuck is it?

49:09.146 --> 49:11.247
-No, dude it's...

49:14.318 --> 49:14.317
It's not even
fucking plugged in.

49:14.319 --> 49:17.653
-What do you mean it's not
plugged in? It just went off.

49:17.655 --> 49:19.255
It has to be fucking
plugged in, it just...

49:22.392 --> 49:25.962
Well then, how did it fucking--

49:26.663 --> 49:27.997
-i don't know, I don't know.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.165
It's off and I unplugged it.

49:31.268 --> 49:33.502
Are you okay? -
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:33.504 --> 49:35.237
Andrew: Where's Amy?

49:40.311 --> 49:43.980
-Seriously, that
was fuckin' creepy.

49:43.982 --> 49:45.181
Mark: Seriously.

49:45.183 --> 49:47.049
-It was a malfunction,
it happens.

49:47.051 --> 49:48.684
-What? No...

49:48.686 --> 49:50.519
You cannot say it was
a malfunction now

49:50.521 --> 49:52.321
because you just told us
that there was no way

49:52.323 --> 49:53.723
in hell it was a
fuckin' malfunction.

49:53.725 --> 49:53.723
-Well, clearly it happened,

49:53.725 --> 49:55.725
so let's please just make sure

49:55.727 --> 49:57.560
it doesn't happen
again, alright.

49:57.562 --> 50:00.229
-At the same time
Amy lost her shit.

50:00.231 --> 50:02.631
You think that's a coincidence
that it fuckin' happened.

50:02.633 --> 50:05.234
-It wasn't a ghost if
that's what you're saying,

50:05.236 --> 50:07.703
I mean, I don't know
man, maybe the sound

50:07.705 --> 50:09.305
of her voice
triggered the wiring.

50:09.307 --> 50:11.741
-Right, the sound of her voice.

50:11.743 --> 50:15.144
-What do you want me to say?

50:15.146 --> 50:20.082
The house is
haunted, we're all gonna die.

50:20.084 --> 50:23.185
-I just want you to admit
that it was fuckin' creepy.

50:25.622 --> 50:26.689
Creepy?

50:27.591 --> 50:29.025
Mark: Creepy.
Lily: Yeah.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.763
-Yes, it was very
fuckin' creepy.

50:33.765 --> 50:35.297
-Thank you.

50:40.138 --> 50:42.071
Mark: Shit,
fuckin' again, Derek?

50:46.209 --> 50:52.815
Carl: I'm never
gonna sleep normal.

50:57.221 --> 50:58.687
Carl: That is Amy.
Yeah, yeah.

51:07.632 --> 51:09.298
Carl: Kill it, kill it.

51:12.737 --> 51:14.336
Motherfucker.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.608
Mark: Son of a
bitch, he's raping her!

51:19.610 --> 51:21.143
Carl: He is not.

51:22.814 --> 51:24.814
Amy: Why the
fuck did you stop?

51:26.451 --> 51:27.716
Asshole, fuck you.

51:28.819 --> 51:29.718
Fuck you!

51:32.090 --> 51:33.089
Carl: Let's go. Come on.

51:33.091 --> 51:35.591
Mark, come on.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.164
Carl:

51:56.413 --> 51:57.246
-Morning.

51:57.248 --> 51:58.214
-Good morning.

51:59.449 --> 52:00.483
-Good morning.

52:00.485 --> 52:01.817
Mark: Hey.

52:09.759 --> 52:11.393
-Good morning, everybody.

52:16.233 --> 52:16.232
-I'm sure it'll be fine.

52:16.234 --> 52:19.401
Lily: I mean, should i
smear, or should I just pat?

52:19.403 --> 52:21.270
-Just dab it on a little bit.

52:21.272 --> 52:22.371
Lily: Does that
hurt when I touch?

52:22.373 --> 52:23.572
-No, it's fine.

52:23.574 --> 52:24.473
Lily: It's too dark?

52:26.576 --> 52:28.777
-Hmm. -Should
we try this one?

52:28.779 --> 52:31.247
-Sure, try that one.

52:31.249 --> 52:32.848
This may not even work.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.783
We'll just write it
into the script.

52:34.785 --> 52:36.218
Derek: Amy?

52:38.188 --> 52:39.488
Babe, are you out here?

52:41.658 --> 52:42.892
Amy?

52:43.693 --> 52:44.727
Amy!?

52:48.165 --> 52:49.365
Oh shit.

52:52.269 --> 52:53.502
Amy.

52:54.638 --> 52:55.638
Amy?

52:56.840 --> 52:58.374
Babe?

53:00.278 --> 53:04.213
Shit, oh god. Baby, I think
you're sleepwalking again.

53:04.215 --> 53:07.716
Oh shit, what happened
to your face?

53:07.718 --> 53:10.286
You must've hit something.

53:10.288 --> 53:11.487
Your eye's all banged
up, here, come inside.

53:11.489 --> 53:12.555
-Oh yeah.

53:13.323 --> 53:14.490
See that?

53:18.261 --> 53:19.228
It's good.

53:19.230 --> 53:20.262
Andrew: It's
good, it'll work.

53:20.264 --> 53:21.730
-Alright.

53:21.732 --> 53:24.433
You're amazing, you know that?

53:24.435 --> 53:25.534
You're gonna
scare everybody.

53:26.570 --> 53:27.336
-Listen...

53:29.206 --> 53:32.741
I know that it's been a
stressful couple days out here.

53:32.743 --> 53:33.676
It's been a little bit trying

53:33.678 --> 53:35.477
with the conditions as they are,

53:35.479 --> 53:39.715
and we don't wanna get
caught up in the blame game

53:39.717 --> 53:43.986
pointing fingers because we are
all in this together, okay?

53:43.988 --> 53:48.224
So, in the interest of
keeping that collegial spirit

53:48.992 --> 53:51.660
I say that we all
get cleaned up,

53:51.662 --> 53:53.529
and head out onto
the road, route 4,

53:53.531 --> 53:54.697
there's a little bar there,

53:54.699 --> 53:57.333
and let's go get
ourselves sloppy drunk.

53:57.335 --> 54:00.502
On my dime. Alright,
what do you say?

54:00.504 --> 54:01.971
-I'll be in the Van.

54:04.841 --> 54:04.840
Lily: I'm gonna hit my head!

54:04.842 --> 54:07.743
Carl: You're only gonna hit
your head if you do it wrong.

54:07.745 --> 54:10.446
Derek: Look out,
look out, look out!

54:10.448 --> 54:11.647
Oh!

54:11.649 --> 54:12.948
Lily: I've already
hit it before.

54:14.317 --> 54:16.752
Derek: Mark, come on! Put
the camera down for once.

54:16.754 --> 54:17.987
Come have a drink,
have some fun.

54:21.291 --> 54:22.524
Derek James, bitch!

54:35.272 --> 54:36.272
-Yes yes yes.

54:36.274 --> 54:37.740
Mark: No thanks.

54:37.742 --> 54:39.408
-Mark, as director, you're
giving me the camera.

54:39.410 --> 54:39.408
Give me the camera.

54:39.410 --> 54:41.610
Derek: To the man
behind the camera!

54:42.747 --> 54:43.712
To the man behind the scenes.

54:43.714 --> 54:47.516
And to all of you for an amazing

54:47.518 --> 54:48.817
week and a half of shooting.

54:50.788 --> 54:52.888
Well, I have some
rather big news

54:52.890 --> 54:54.923
to share with everyone
at the table.

54:54.925 --> 54:59.361
The illustrious and very
influential Scott weinberg

54:59.363 --> 55:01.463
is coming to do a
story on the film.

55:01.465 --> 55:02.831
Scott weinberg from fearnet?

55:02.833 --> 55:05.067
Amy: This film? Our film?
-Our film.

55:05.069 --> 55:07.069
Andrew: How in the
hell did you swing that?

55:07.071 --> 55:09.071
-Oh, I have my ways.
Carl: He's a swinger.

55:10.474 --> 55:11.874
Andrew: You lied to him...

55:11.876 --> 55:15.778
-No, no, I told him the
god's honest truth, I swear.

55:17.047 --> 55:18.547
Well, maybe not all of it.

55:20.084 --> 55:23.352
-The last time he said
that I got herpes.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.921
- What was that?

55:29.092 --> 55:30.426
Andrew: It's
gonna be a long day,

55:30.428 --> 55:30.426
I'm just warning you.

55:30.428 --> 55:33.329
-No, that's okay, I don't
mind, but I think that...

55:37.367 --> 55:39.802
If you're talking
about production

55:39.804 --> 55:41.870
in that kind of way then it's--

55:53.817 --> 55:56.852
no, you made me miss! Derek!

55:58.988 --> 56:03.392
-Carl, you saw
it, it was there--

56:09.366 --> 56:10.899
Carl: That didn't last
very long now, did it?

56:15.405 --> 56:16.472
Andrew: What
the fuck is this?

56:16.474 --> 56:17.606
What the fuck?

56:17.608 --> 56:20.509
Mark: Oh my god, oh no.

56:20.511 --> 56:21.443
Andrew: Did we get robbed?

56:21.445 --> 56:23.712
Amy: Oh my god.

56:26.483 --> 56:27.716
Animals?

56:27.718 --> 56:29.918
Lily: I don't know,
it tore everything up.

56:29.920 --> 56:32.855
Derek: Something
must've got in.

56:32.857 --> 56:33.822
Carl: Look at my gear, man!

56:33.824 --> 56:34.990
What the fuck!?

56:34.992 --> 56:38.827
Awe, it's just like
somebody fuckin'

56:38.829 --> 56:40.662
just trashed everything.

56:40.664 --> 56:42.664
Everything's here.

56:45.802 --> 56:47.035
What the fuck is that?

56:50.039 --> 56:51.173
Ugh.

56:52.008 --> 56:52.808
What is this?

56:53.843 --> 56:55.577
Derek: Somebody
must have broken in.

56:55.579 --> 56:56.879
Lily: Should
we call the cops?

56:56.881 --> 56:59.481
Andrew: We don't
have cell service

56:59.483 --> 57:00.849
how the fuck are we
gonna call the cops?

57:00.851 --> 57:02.050
-There's nobody out here.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.652
Nobody comes out.

57:03.654 --> 57:04.820
Is anything missing?

57:07.056 --> 57:09.591
Lily: I don't know.

57:09.593 --> 57:10.959
Andrew: No, nothing
of mine is missing

57:10.961 --> 57:14.797
from what I can tell.

57:14.799 --> 57:16.532
Amy: I don't know.

57:16.534 --> 57:18.000
Carl: This is your
bullshit, right?

57:18.002 --> 57:21.837
Derek: No, it's not
my fuckin' bullshit man.

57:21.839 --> 57:22.871
Of course not.

57:22.873 --> 57:24.673
-Of course not, of course not!

57:24.675 --> 57:26.008
Why would it be my bullshit?

57:26.010 --> 57:30.045
Why is none of your
stuff even touched?

57:30.047 --> 57:31.680
-I was at the bar
the same as you!

57:31.682 --> 57:33.148
I don't know why that's--

57:33.150 --> 57:34.216
-it's coincidence, just
like all the other

57:34.218 --> 57:35.651
crazy fuckin' shit, right!?

57:37.187 --> 57:41.490
-I'm out of here
tomorrow, I can't--

57:41.492 --> 57:44.126
-oh great, oh yeah, who
are you kidding man?

57:44.128 --> 57:46.962
You've been looking for an
excuse ever since day one.

57:46.964 --> 57:49.731
-That's because you took us
to a fuckin' haunted house!

57:49.733 --> 57:51.099
-Oh my god.

57:51.101 --> 57:52.601
-All this fuckin' weird
shit has been happening

57:52.603 --> 57:54.536
ever since we fuckin' got here!

57:54.538 --> 57:56.505
Since day one. You
had the crazy shit

57:56.507 --> 57:58.841
with the dishes, with that!

57:58.843 --> 58:00.876
Fuckin' Lily almost died!

58:02.712 --> 58:05.180
And now all my shit
is covered in slime!

58:05.182 --> 58:06.715
God knows what the
fuck is out there

58:06.717 --> 58:08.050
making all those creepy
noises at night.

58:09.085 --> 58:10.886
Derek: Hey, shut up, Andrew.

58:10.888 --> 58:12.721
Carl: Hey, what did you say?

58:12.723 --> 58:14.656
Carl: No no Andrew,
don't shut up, what?

58:14.658 --> 58:18.594
Andrew: Nothing,
nevermind, nevermind.

58:18.596 --> 58:22.164
-Okay, okay, so yeah,
that was you, great.

58:22.166 --> 58:26.802
Fine, you know... good
luck with your movie.

58:27.737 --> 58:30.839
I'm gonna go tomorrow, and
you know, god bless you.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.674
Have fun. -Well,
you know what!

58:32.676 --> 58:34.243
Good luck with your
Ben affleck movie

58:34.245 --> 58:36.111
when you don't have
your fuckin' gear!

58:39.249 --> 58:43.218
-What are you---i
own your gear Carl!

58:43.220 --> 58:44.953
-You gave me a fuckin' loan.

58:44.955 --> 58:46.522
-Right, and you didn't
pay that loan back,

58:46.524 --> 58:48.757
so if you read the small
print in your contract

58:48.759 --> 58:50.859
you would know that i
own your fuckin' gear,

58:50.861 --> 58:52.528
and maybe you should wake
up and open your eyes

58:52.530 --> 58:53.896
next time. That gear is mine.

58:57.967 --> 58:57.966
-You're a fuckin' asshole, man.

58:57.968 --> 59:00.168
-Yeah, I'm a fuckin'
asshole? -Yeah.

59:04.707 --> 59:06.008
You're a fucking asshole!

59:12.148 --> 59:14.917
Andrew: Guys, let's just
all go to sleep, shall we?

59:14.919 --> 59:16.251
-Where is he gonna go?

59:19.756 --> 59:21.890
-Mark, are you kidding me.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.759
I told you not to
film that stuff.

59:23.761 --> 59:24.993
Mark: Sorry.

59:24.995 --> 59:26.929
Derek: Mark! Just turn
it the fuck off dude.

59:26.931 --> 59:28.063
Mark: Yeah.

59:43.713 --> 59:45.180
-He's a big boy.

59:45.182 --> 59:46.715
-He didn't have a car
is the only thing.

59:46.717 --> 59:48.150
-I know, I know.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.988
Maybe he hitchhiked,
maybe he called a friend.

59:52.990 --> 59:55.157
I'm sure he's halfway
to El Paso by now. I...

59:57.293 --> 59:59.828
It sucks, it really
fuckin' sucks.

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:06.602
Mark: Well, this part is on.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.804
He always had these on too.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:10.272
Derek: Do they each
go on individually?

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:13.075
Mark: No, he would hit
a button, is it this?

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.276
Oh, okay!

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.611
-Look at that,
you're a natural.

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.379
-Lily pad, the sound woman.

01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:19.047
-Alright, well shit,
how hard can it be?

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:19.047
You just gotta hit record,

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.717
and point the microphone
at whoever's talkin'.

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:24.820
- Yeah.

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:39.901
Andrew: Good
Amy, you ran, okay.

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:39.901
Derek: No, no, it's
gotta be on her shoulder.

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:42.371
Andrew: No, why would
it be on her shoulder?

01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:42.371
-It's bouncing all over
the god damn place,

01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:45.040
you can't even watch it.
-That'll look too planned.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.208
No one who's running
for their life

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:46.208
will ever worry about getting--

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.710
-are you personally gonna
go into the theater,

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:48.710
and clean up all
the puke because

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:51.279
that's what's gonna happen
if you show it like that.

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.648
Especially in 3D, it's
gonna be barf city.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:52.648
-I don't even understand
why she's still

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.283
holding the fuckin' camera.
Why hasn't she thrown it away?

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.418
-Because the movie
would be over

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.253
if she puts the camera down!

01:00:58.255 --> 01:00:59.888
-Fine, well, we
need to come up with

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.423
a halfway decent excuse as to
why she's still recording.

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:10.198
-She needs the light.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.301
Andrew: No, why is
she still recording?

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:15.337
-The light doesn't work
if she's not recording.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:15.337
Andrew: Yes it does.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:17.673
-That audience
doesn't know that.

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:18.840
-Yes they do!

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.110
-Oh, thank you, oh I wondered!

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:23.679
The queen has spoken!

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:25.313
Now we know, oh good!

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:25.313
How about you mark!

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:28.183
Do you have something
you wanna add to this?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.752
-Christ, I don't know what
everybody here started to think

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:32.154
this was some sort of democracy,

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.989
but we're doing it my
way, end of discussion!

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.957
I'm fuckin' sick of this!

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:38.760
Alright, Amy get the camera.

01:01:38.762 --> 01:01:40.262
We're putting it
on your shoulder,

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.931
and it's going to
be stable there.

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:44.366
Carl, roll sound!

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.271
Let's go!

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:50.739
Andrew: Action.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.341
-Honestly, why did your
brother even hire me?

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:55.010
I don't even understand
at this point.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:59.014
He obviously wants to direct
the fuckin' thing himself.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:00.348
I mean, what is the point

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.885
of making the first 3D
found footage horror movie

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.821
if it's just gonna suck?

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:07.389
If it's just...

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.459
-Yeah, tensions are
high on any set,

01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:13.962
but art, good art,

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:18.467
is never easy, and so yeah,

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:19.167
the long days do wear on you,

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:25.907
but I wouldn't trade my job
for any job in the world.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.810
Mark: Ok, thanks.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:30.312
Amy: That was
total horse shit.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.353
Amy: Oh my god!

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:39.788
Oh my god!

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.156
Derek: What what what?!

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:46.428
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.428
Andrew: What
the fuck happened?

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.030
Derek: She's bleeding,
she's bleeding!

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:50.866
-Derek, Derek, Derek.

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:54.002
Derek: Awe fuck!

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:55.337
-What the hell happened?

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:56.938
-Sorry, I don't
know, I don't know.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:56.938
-Did an animal get her?

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:56.938
Derek: I don't
know, god damn it.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.908
-Are you bleeding
anywhere else?

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.209
-I don't know!

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:04.846
Derek: It's okay, put
pressure on, put pressure on.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:06.114
Andrew: Amy, we're
taking you to the hospital.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.350
-Yeah, oh my god!

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:10.519
Amy, Amy, Amy, it's okay.

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:11.920
Mark: Andrew!

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:12.487
Andrew: Yeah?

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:13.288
Mark: Get her ID.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.223
Andrew: Got it!

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:16.224
-Take your time,
take your time.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.562
Take it slow. You alright?

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:44.486
-Jesus Christ, you're
just giving her

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:47.422
the negative attention
she's after.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:50.025
Mark: What is that
supposed to mean?

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:53.495
-Why do you think
people cut themselves?

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.997
Mark: She didn't cut herself.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.399
-Right.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.869
And she's never done
it before either.

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:02.170
Kid, you do not
know my wife nearly

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.471
as well as you think you do.

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:29.397
Amy: Do you ever sleep?

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:33.101
- Again?

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:36.238
Amy: What are you
watching this time?

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.973
An interview with
my mother about

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:40.041
what a massive disappointment
i turned out to be?

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.914
-I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:47.315
I should have never let you--

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:49.551
Amy: It's fine, I'm
sorry I said that.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.291
-How's your arm?

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.362
Amy: It's okay.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:05.667
The doc gave me some pretty
bad ass pain killers,

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:08.637
so I think I'll be fine.

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:12.474
What's that?

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:16.945
Make it bigger.

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.150
Did you film us sleeping?

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.318
-No.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.020
Amy: Mark, that's
super creepy.

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:27.389
-No, this wasn't me.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:29.090
Somebody must have
taken my camera.

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.527
There, see?

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:37.432
Amy: Oh my god,
this is last night.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.942
-Do you think Derek did this?

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.344
Amy: I don't know.

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:51.980
I don't know, but this shit
is not funny anymore.

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.522
Okay, then it must've been Lily.

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:01.523
Right?

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:02.657
-Or you.

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:04.259
Amy: It's not me.

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:08.396
It's not.

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:14.602
It's not me, mark.

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:15.670
-Who else could it be?

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:18.006
Amy: I don't know!

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:19.574
What?

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:20.642
Oh my god.

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.745
Who is doing this?

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:25.513
Why is someone filming me?

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:39.761
What the fuck?

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:44.065
Oh my god!

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:48.670
What is that?

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:51.206
-That's that mirror back there.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:56.544
He doesn't have a camera!
How is he--holy fuck!

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:57.746
Amy: What?!

01:06:57.748 --> 01:06:59.114
Wave your arm again,
wave your arm again!

01:07:01.485 --> 01:07:04.019
Amy: Turn it off,
just turn this shit off.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:05.153
Turn it off, mark!

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:07.155
Mark: It won't
stop, it won't stop!

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:08.223
Amy: Shh, shh, shh.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.727
Do you hear that?

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:14.362
I think it's saying something.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:35.350
Derek: What the fuck?
What's going on?

01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:36.718
Amy: I don't know.
It just came--

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.553
Andrew: What the fuck?
Jesus Christ, are you okay?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.255
Amy: No, I'm not okay.
It just flew at me.

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:43.158
Derek: Mark, are you
okay? What going on?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.193
Mark: We were watching
some weird footage and--

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:45.193
Derek: You guys
are screaming.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:48.196
Amy: It just flew at me,
just now. It came in the room.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:50.331
Derek: Amy, it's okay.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.167
Amy, Amy,
Amy, calm down.

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:54.469
Okay, mark, what's happening?

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:56.571
Mark: We were watching
some footage from last night,

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.206
but I didn't take it--
Amy: Just show them.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.240
Derek: You're
watching new footage?

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:00.275
Mark: No it was
something else--

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:01.743
Amy: Just show them! Please.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.711
Mark: Okay. Here here here.

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:05.447
We were watching this interview,

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:07.849
and then it...

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.217
Derek: What are we watching?

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.752
Mark: It was right here.

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.220
Amy: Where'd it go?

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:13.188
Mark, where'd it go?

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.755
Mark: I don't know.

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:13.755
Amy: Just show them!

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:17.559
Just show them, we
just saw the video!

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.127
It cut my arm!

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:20.462
Andrew: What cut your arm?

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:22.330
Amy: It just came in here,
in the room, and it flew.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:24.232
Derek: What came in
here in the room, Amy?

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.267
Amy: I don't know, I don't
know, it was big, it was black.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.136
Derek: Amy
please, mark, mark?

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.636
Was there anything in the room.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:31.272
Mark: No, nothing--

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.774
Amy: You saw it!
You just saw it!

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.109
It was just in here.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:34.876
Mark: No.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.511
Amy: Yes, it just came at me!

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:39.613
Come on, it's on the camera,
just show them, please.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.750
Derek: Amy, calm down!

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:45.787
Amy: It just flew--

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:49.858
Derek: Turn the camera off.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:50.892
Mark: I'm not
turning anything off.

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:52.193
-Turn the fuckin' camera off!

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.127
I'm not talking
about that harpie

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:53.862
with the fuckin' camera on!

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:54.863
Mark: Don't!

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.201
Don't call her that.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.237
-Look, I will call her
whatever the fuck I want to.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.837
She's my wife.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.740
Okay? Mine, not yours, my wife!

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:08.877
Oh yeah, you think
that's fuckin' funny?

01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:10.444
You know what, go
home, you're fired.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.345
-Good.

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:12.412
-Go home mark!
-I am.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:17.285
And I'm taking Amy with me.

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.420
-No, she stays.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.288
She stays, she's got two
more days of filming,

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.224
we got weinberg coming
tomorrow, she stays!

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.225
-No, she doesn't.

01:09:24.227 --> 01:09:25.760
I'm taking her away.

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:32.200
-You're the big man?

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:33.902
You think she needs
you to protect her?

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:35.670
That whore can take
care of herself, mark.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.337
She's got you wrapped
around her little finger,

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.406
but let me tell you something,

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:39.573
she is not who you think she is,

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:40.942
she's the fuckin' devil!

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.911
-Right, oh yeah, you want that!

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:45.613
There's my tough guy,
huh, you little shit?!

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.582
You like that?!

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:49.184
-She's fuckin' bat shit, mark.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.417
You watched the tape,
there's nothin' there,

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.287
she's fuckin' crazy!

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.489
-Fuck off. I know what I saw!

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:55.924
Something really fucked
up going on here,

01:09:55.926 --> 01:10:02.263
and I don't know of you're
behind it or not or what, but...

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:03.798
I'm taking Amy away from
here before she gets hurt.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:08.369
-Oh.

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:11.973
Alright.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.275
Look at Mr. finally grew-a-pair.

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:17.445
Okay.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:19.514
Just, ask her.

01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:23.585
Ask her to choose between
you and her film career.

01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:24.786
If she wants to go, you can go.

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:26.387
Good riddance to both of you.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.560
Wouldn't hold your
breath though.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.971
Please, don't.

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:46.975
Please.

01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:50.945
I'm gonna record everything,
okay, to protect you.

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:58.486
- You're gonna need
a better excuse than that.

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.390
Mark: What?

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:10.431
-To keep the camera running in
the third act, you're gonna...

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:12.433
We'll have to come
up with something.

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:20.475
Please, just don't point at
me like an interview, then.

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.669
-I told Derek we were leaving.

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.846
-I'm gonna stay.

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:01.349
-Amy.

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:03.518
Amy--
-i have to.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.620
-Why?

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:08.656
-I just do.

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.462
I just have to.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.866
-Okay.

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:24.505
Then I'm staying too.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:26.808
-No.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:28.343
-Yes.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.979
I'm not leaving you here
by yourself, I'm not.

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.516
No, please.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.720
You have to go.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:45.860
Your brother is
right, I'm bad news,

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:48.963
and I don't deserve your help.

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.805
-I'm not going anywhere.

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:04.545
I'm not.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.015
I'm not going anywhere.

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:46.988
Andrew: We got wheels
guys, we got wheels.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.991
-Alright, game face time.

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:52.627
You got this mark?

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:53.694
Let's go everybody!

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.996
Scott weinberg, here we go!

01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:56.731
-How you doin'? Scott,
good to meet you.

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:59.000
Andrew: Andrew Reed,
nice to meet you.

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:01.469
-Everybody, the
legendary Scott weinberg!

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.704
Here on set! -
Scott, and you are?

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:04.972
-Lily.
-Lily, great.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:06.073
Really good to meet you.

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:07.642
-How was the ride in, alright?

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:10.044
- It was long, it was good--
-bumpy, right?

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:11.746
-Is this an off day, or...?

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:13.147
-Heck no, we're just
about to get shootin'.

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:15.983
We've got everything
set up in there.

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:18.653
-So, this is your crew?

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.721
-Yeah, this is my
crew. -Oh okay.

01:14:20.723 --> 01:14:23.157
-You think this is
high-budget Hollywood

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:25.693
in terms of how
decrepit, and dusty--

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:27.061
-did you add the cobwebs?

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:29.997
Or did they come with this?

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.867
-A little of column a,
a little of column b.

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.969
-Four people making
a feature film?

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.605
-We had a little bit of
a bigger crew originally,

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:38.940
but things, I just i
think we just decided

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.608
to thin it out a bit.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.944
-You decided you didn't need
props, set, design, makeup--

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:46.180
-well, I mean, look at
what we got. This is...

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:47.615
- Yeah,
you can't fake this.

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:48.816
Andrew: This
is the real deal.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.051
-Would you like to
see some of what

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:51.219
we've been working on actually?

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:53.654
-Okay.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:54.889
-I think then you'll
get a better sense

01:14:54.891 --> 01:15:01.128
of what we're trying to do here.

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:02.730
Derek: You out here?

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:05.833
Amy?

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.169
Amy.

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:13.508
Christ!

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:16.777
-Hmm, let's do those
interviews why don't we.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:18.813
-Great, great, yes, perfect.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:20.047
-I'm so glad you
came out, thank you.

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:22.183
-Yeah, thank you
for inviting me.

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:24.051
What's with the eye?

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.920
-What happened?
-It's makeup.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.021
-Really!
-Mmm-hmm.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:30.024
-That is impressive,
and that too?

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:30.024
-Of course.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.960
-Why don't you tell me what
you're shooting tonight

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:36.163
because I'm excited
to see you on set.

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:40.935
-Mmm-hmm, well, this is
kind of the peak of drama,

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:41.769
I don't wanna give
away the plot,

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:46.073
but you know, the marriage
between Derek and Amy

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:48.209
is sort of crumbling
and falling apart,

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.745
and this is a moment
of recompense.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:53.247
-See, that's amazing that
you guys can pull that off

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:55.917
because you're clearly
crazy in love, you know.

01:15:57.019 --> 01:16:01.188
It comes across if you can
play that you hate each other,

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:04.725
that's good acting.
-Yes.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:06.894
-Yeah, I think that works
better than an argument,

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.863
we see the scene, and then
i turn into the demon,

01:16:08.865 --> 01:16:10.097
and I kill you.

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:12.099
-That's just a bit of
an abrupt ending, no?

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:15.603
-Well, it's the
nature of the genre.

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:17.071
-I understand that,
but it's just so--

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.707
-wait a minute, why does my
character have to die at all?

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.943
-No, of course you
die, that's silly.

01:16:21.945 --> 01:16:23.277
-Why? Why can't I escape?

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:25.079
-Well, because that's what
makes it "found footage".

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.114
-It's the one hard and
fast rule of found footage

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.282
is that everybody dies.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:30.785
Otherwise Derek, it's
just... footage.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:32.787
-Yeah, no, I'm not
sure because I think

01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:34.956
it might be more
original if I got away.

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:35.990
-Look, everybody dies--

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.625
-I'm all for originality,

01:16:37.627 --> 01:16:39.794
but that doesn't make
sense, you both die,

01:16:39.796 --> 01:16:41.095
so she's right.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:43.731
Okay, if we just
change a few things--

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:45.333
-what we could do
is---i need to live.

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:50.871
-Okay, whatever, that's good,

01:16:50.873 --> 01:16:52.907
just figure it out
by tonight because

01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:54.842
we're running out of
script by tomorrow, so.

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:01.983
I knew it man.

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:01.983
I knew this was gonna happen,

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:01.983
I knew it was gonna
fuckin' happen,

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:05.686
and I didn't listen
and here I am,

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:07.688
and I'm sorry, I know
it's your brother,

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:11.158
but what fuckin' year does
he think it is, 2005?

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.161
I mean, fuck, this genre has
had two halfway decent films,

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:15.796
two halfway decent films,

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:17.865
one of which was 15
fuckin' years ago.

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:19.934
And every other found
footage film since then

01:17:19.936 --> 01:17:22.370
has been complete bullshit.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:23.871
I mean, why people waste
their fuckin' money

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.740
on this vomit-inducing
amateur-hour bullshit

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:27.842
is fuckin' beyond me, and yet,

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:30.745
here I am trying to make
something halfway decent,

01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:32.980
a halfway decent found
footage horror film

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.315
that's different than
every other asshole

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.783
who's got a fuckin' iPhone,

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:37.418
and every fuckin'
step of the way,

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.689
your fuckin' brother
cock blocks me! Fuck!

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.824
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.227
Please delete that.

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:48.295
Mark: Umm, I...

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.965
-No, fuck it, I don't care.

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:01.175
-Alright, so this is it.

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.845
We are about to shoot
the climax of the movie,

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:07.381
and if you look
carefully over there,

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:12.687
you will see, boom, hey,
Scott weinberg from fearnet,

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:15.156
who's joining us on
the set here today.

01:18:15.158 --> 01:18:17.458
I should warn you that he
has been sworn to secrecy

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.993
about what he sees here today.

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:20.361
We told him that if
he spills the beans,

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:23.030
the spectre will
tear his face off.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:26.233
So, if you want to
find out how it ends,

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:28.369
you'll have to come
see it in theatres.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.804
We'll see you there.

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:33.340
I am Derek James signing off.

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:37.812
Let's shoot.

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:39.213
-Alright, scene 50, take two.

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:00.935
-I'm sorry.

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.180
Derek: I am too.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.463
-I just, umm...

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.135
I don't know, I thought
coming out here

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:39.173
would fix us, somehow.

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:44.111
It's just been really hard.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.379
Derek: I know.

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.816
I thought so too.

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:56.257
And I didn't realize how
hard this was gonna be.

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.265
-I've missed you.

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:09.503
I love you.

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.912
Derek: I love you too.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.465
Amy: Why don't you
turn the camera off,

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:39.900
and come to bed.

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:44.138
Derek: Okay.

01:20:57.987 --> 01:20:59.086
Andrew: The fuck?

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:01.355
Mark: Amy, no!!

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:05.259
Derek! Derek! No!

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:24.912
Andrew: You okay, Lily?

01:21:24.914 --> 01:21:27.181
-Yeah, I'm okay.

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:27.181
Andrew: What
the fuck was that?

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:31.352
Mark: Mark, mark,
oh my god your feet!

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.420
Andrew: Oh fuck, oh fuck.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:35.956
Weinberg: What the--?

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.459
-So, is this a joke?

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:40.127
Andrew: What?

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:43.130
-You guys are trying to get
me into the film because--

01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:45.633
Andrew: Ahh! Fuck!

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:46.934
Oh shit!

01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:48.035
Scott?

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:50.137
Jesus Christ, oh my god, Scott?

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:52.239
Scott?

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:56.911
Lily: Mark!

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.376
Mark: Ah, fuck!

01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:38.619
Mark: Ahh!

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.454
Mark: Lily?
Lily: Mark, mark, mark.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.122
Mark: It's okay, it's okay,
it's just me, it's okay.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:45.392
Lily: What the
hell is happening?

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:47.728
What
are we gonna do?

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:49.163
Mark: I don't know.

01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:51.031
Lily: She killed him,
mark. She killed him.

01:22:51.033 --> 01:22:52.299
Oh my god.

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:57.171
What are you doing?

01:22:57.173 --> 01:22:59.039
Mark: I'm cranking up the
iso so I can see better.

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:00.541
-Why do you still
have the stupid thing?

01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:01.976
Just put it down!

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:04.311
Mark: I think it's the
only way you can see it.

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:08.649
-What are you talking
about, see what?

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:10.417
Mark: Did you see
what happened to Andrew?

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:14.722
-His chest exploded.

01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:17.291
Mark: Yeah, but you
didn't see the smoke?

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:19.994
The demon? The specter?
Whatever it is.

01:23:19.996 --> 01:23:22.229
-What the hell are
you talking about?

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:24.698
Mark: It was there, i
could see it on the camera,

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.266
but when it came
out of the cabin,

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:29.636
I couldn't see it with my eyes.

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:31.105
-What?

01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:33.474
Mark: And last night,
Amy could see it too,

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:36.343
but I couldn't because she was
looking through the camera.

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.012
-Jesus, are you sure?

01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:40.214
Mark: I think it's
making us film it.

01:23:40.216 --> 01:23:42.316
I think it wants us to
keep the camera rolling.

01:23:42.318 --> 01:23:45.386
-Are you saying that this
thing is alive or something?

01:23:45.388 --> 01:23:46.487
Oh my god.

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:47.621
Mark: Shh, Lily.

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:47.621
-Just turn the light on!

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:51.158
Mark: No, I can't,
it'll draw it right to us.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.626
Lily: Then what
are we gonna do?

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:54.528
Mark: I don't know.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.297
I think we need to try
and make it to the Van.

01:23:57.299 --> 01:23:59.533
-No, no, no, no, no, I'm
not going back there.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.635
Mark: Lily, we have to.
These woods go for miles.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:03.337
-I don't care, i
can't go back there.

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:07.808
Mark: Okay, okay, stay
here, you stay here,

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:10.778
I'll go to the Van, and
I'll come back for you.

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:11.812
Lily: No, mark, wait!

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:11.812
Mark: I'll come back.

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:14.648
Lily: Okay, okay,
okay, mark, I'm coming.

01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:18.185
Mark: Lily? Lily, what
happened, are you okay?

01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:19.253
Lily: Mark,
turn on the light.

01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:19.253
Mark: Shh.

01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:22.322
Lily: Mark, turn
on the light, please!

01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:24.124
Turn on the light mark!

01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:26.560
Mark: Oh god!

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.196
Lily, be quiet.

01:24:29.198 --> 01:24:30.264
-Mark! Mark, it's Carl!

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:31.698
Mark: Lily please, shh.

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.513
Amy: Help.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.316
Somebody.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:23.851
Please help me.

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:25.419
Mark: Amy?

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:35.696
Amy!

01:25:41.237 --> 01:25:44.738
Amy: Mark?
Andrew? Is that you?

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:47.474
Mark: Amy!

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:51.712
Amy: Hello, oh! I can
hear someone honking.

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:57.484
Please, you have
to come find me.

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:03.257
I'm in the woods
somewhere, I don't know.

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:15.802
The camera, I have
the other camera.

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:21.675
Oh, go back inside, find
the other wireless mic.

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:27.714
I think I'll be able to hear
you through the camera.

01:26:27.716 --> 01:26:30.384
Please, please, honk
twice if you can hear me.

01:26:30.386 --> 01:26:32.653
Oh,
thank god.

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:45.299
Okay, I'm turning on the camera.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.672
I don't know what happened.

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:57.311
The last thing i
remember was that thing

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.847
just coming at me in the room,

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:07.988
and then I just, I woke
up, I'm in the woods,

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:11.925
and I'm just covered in blood.

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.698
Mark: Where the fuck?

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:35.449
Amy: I think i
know where I am!

01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:36.883
I think I'm by the lake.

01:27:36.885 --> 01:27:38.652
I'm gonna try to get
back to the cabin.

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:45.292
Mark: Fuck, where is it!?

01:27:45.294 --> 01:27:46.460
Where is it?

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:50.831
Oh shit.

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:56.436
Derek.

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:30.404
No, no.

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:55.595
Okay.

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:57.864
Here we go.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.800
Okay.

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:05.539
Come on, come on, work, fuck.

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:10.410
Amy: Oh god, mark,
I'm lost again.

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:12.913
I don't know where I am.

01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:14.548
God, where am I?

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.126
Mark: Scott?

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:31.365
Scott?

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:34.501
Scott?

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:41.842
Amy: Oh, oh, i
see the house!!

01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:43.009
I see the house!

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:02.062
Amy: Okay, okay.

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:08.769
Mark: Amy?

01:30:08.771 --> 01:30:10.470
Amy, can you hear me?

01:30:10.472 --> 01:30:11.805
Amy: Mark?

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:12.906
Mark: Amy?

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:16.510
Amy.

01:30:16.512 --> 01:30:18.445
Amy: Mark, is that you?

01:30:18.447 --> 01:30:19.513
Mark: Yeah.

01:30:19.515 --> 01:30:21.415
Amy: Oh my god, mark!

01:30:21.417 --> 01:30:23.450
I can hear you, oh my god.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:24.885
Mark: Are you okay?

01:30:24.887 --> 01:30:26.586
Amy: Oh, I don't
know, I don't know.

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:28.989
I am so scared.

01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:30.791
Mark: It's okay, it's okay,
everything's gonna be okay.

01:30:30.793 --> 01:30:32.859
Amy: What the
hell is going on?

01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:36.897
Mark: Let's just
find each other, okay?

01:30:36.899 --> 01:30:38.598
Amy: Okay, okay.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.866
Mark: Where are you?

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:41.468
Amy: I don't know.

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:44.471
I think I'm in front of
the house, somewhere.

01:30:44.473 --> 01:30:45.472
Mark: Okay, good.

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:45.472
Amy: I just saw lights.

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:47.474
Mark: Meet me
at the Van, okay?

01:30:47.476 --> 01:30:48.608
Amy: Okay.

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:04.524
Mark: Where are you?

01:31:04.526 --> 01:31:05.592
I don't see you.

01:31:05.594 --> 01:31:07.661
Amy: I'm at the
edge of the woods.

01:31:07.663 --> 01:31:08.995
Straight ahead.

01:31:08.997 --> 01:31:09.896
Mark: Where?

01:31:09.898 --> 01:31:11.665
Amy: I can see you.

01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:13.500
I see your camera light.

01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:14.201
Can you see me now?

01:31:14.203 --> 01:31:15.001
Mark: Is that you?

01:31:15.003 --> 01:31:15.969
Amy: Yeah.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.537
Yes.

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.039
It's me, I'm here.

01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:21.107
Mark: Okay, stay there,
I'm gonna come get you.

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:31.952
Alright.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.162
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Amy!

01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:44.164
Amy!! No!!

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.536
Amy, no, no.

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:55.275
Come on, get up, we gotta go.

01:31:55.277 --> 01:31:57.244
Come on.

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:11.992
Okay, okay.

01:32:11.994 --> 01:32:13.693
Get up, get up, get inside.

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:29.776
Alright, let's go.

01:32:38.586 --> 01:32:40.587
You're gonna be okay,
everything's gonna be okay.

01:32:40.589 --> 01:32:42.722
Okay? Okay?

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:48.295
Okay, okay, okay.

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:51.698
Amy?

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:53.867
Don't do that.

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:56.770
Amy,
please, please don't.

01:32:56.772 --> 01:32:58.004
Please don't, Amy!

01:32:58.006 --> 01:32:59.906
Amy, no, no.

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:05.345
Amy?

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:32.639
Oh no.

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:35.675
No, no, no, no, no.

01:33:37.379 --> 01:33:40.246
God dammit, no, no, no.

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:42.616
No, no, no, no!

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:45.919
Amy: Mark.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:53.727
Mark.

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:58.865
-Oh my god, Amy, are you okay?

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:03.236
Amy: I don't think so.

01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:04.371
-I can't get the
car started again,

01:34:04.373 --> 01:34:05.872
I don't know what to do.

01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:08.074
Amy: It doesn't matter.

01:34:08.076 --> 01:34:09.309
-What do you mean?

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:13.913
Amy: It doesn't
matter anymore.

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:18.685
I need you to do something.

01:34:18.687 --> 01:34:20.020
-No, I have to get
you out of here,

01:34:20.022 --> 01:34:22.222
I have to get you help.

01:34:22.224 --> 01:34:23.189
Amy: Get the camera.

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.393
-What?

01:34:26.395 --> 01:34:28.828
Amy: Get the camera.

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:29.863
-Amy.

01:34:29.865 --> 01:34:30.964
Amy: Do it.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.667
Point it at me.

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:46.713
How do I look?

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:51.751
-You look beautiful.

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.726
-I'm sorry.

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:03.396
-It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.968
-I wanted him dead.

01:35:10.004 --> 01:35:11.337
-I know.

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:14.407
He deserved it.

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.043
For everything he
put you through.

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:20.346
-And you...

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.389
Thank you.

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:32.158
-For what?

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.961
-For coming back for me.

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:39.032
-Of course I came back for you.

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.770
Of course I came back.

01:35:46.107 --> 01:35:48.208
-I wish you hadn't.

01:35:48.210 --> 01:35:49.476
-Why?

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:54.914
-I hoped you would
remember the rule.

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:57.917
-What?

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:05.158
-The one rule of
found footage movies.

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.432
-I'm sorry.

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:15.769
I'm so sorry.
