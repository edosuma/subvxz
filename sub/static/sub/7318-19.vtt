WEBVTT

00:12.133 --> 00:14.567
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.600 --> 00:17.033
WHO'S MARK?
DEREK FOUND US
IN BED TOGETHER.

00:17.067 --> 00:19.533
HOW COME YOU CAN
FORGIVE HER BUT NOT ME?
I DIDN'T FORGIVE HER.

00:19.567 --> 00:21.333
DENNY, THIS IS DR. STEVENS.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.533
SHE'LL BE TENDING TO YOU
PRIOR TO SURGERY.

00:23.567 --> 00:25.800
THAT GUY ALEX,
YOU WITH HIM?
NO.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.800
GOOD. MEANS I DON'T
HAVE TO FIGHT HIM FOR YOU.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.767
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?
GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT

00:29.800 --> 00:32.200
TRYING TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL
BEFORE THE BIRTH.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.767
THIS IS OUR SON.
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.467
HE BROKE UP WITH ME
FOR THIS GIRL

00:35.500 --> 00:36.667
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HE'S ALIVE.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.333
LISTEN TO ME, GEORGE,
YOU, MEREDITH GREY--

00:38.367 --> 00:39.333
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

00:39.367 --> 00:40.633
YOU LOOK SAD.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.667
I JUST SAW MY FATHER FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.500
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU NEED?

00:44.533 --> 00:46.633
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING
FROM YOU.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.333
(Izzie) YOU COULD JUST TRY
TELLING HER HOW YOU FEEL.

00:49.367 --> 00:51.267
I WILL NEVER
STOP LOVING YOU.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.300
***

00:56.567 --> 00:58.733
(George)
OKAY, SO, SOMETIMES,

00:58.767 --> 01:01.767
EVEN THE BEST OF US
MAKE RASH DECISIONS...

01:01.800 --> 01:03.700
BAD DECISIONS,

01:03.733 --> 01:06.733
DECISIONS WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW
WE'RE GOING TO REGRET

01:06.767 --> 01:08.500
THE MOMENT--
THE MINUTE--

01:08.533 --> 01:12.200
ESPECIALLY THE MORNING AFTER.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.333
I MEAN,
MAYBE NOT "REGRET" REGRET

01:14.367 --> 01:16.067
BECAUSE AT LEAST,

01:16.100 --> 01:18.700
YOU KNOW,
WE PUT OURSELVES OUT THERE.

01:18.733 --> 01:20.800
BUT STILL...
(alarm buzzes)

01:20.833 --> 01:24.467
SOMETHING INSIDE US
DECIDES TO DO A CRAZY THING,

01:24.500 --> 01:26.333
A THING WE KNOW

01:26.367 --> 01:28.533
WILL PROBABLY TURN AROUND
AND BITE US IN THE ASS...

01:28.567 --> 01:30.200
(Doc barking)

01:30.233 --> 01:32.500
YET WE DO IT ANYWAY.

01:32.533 --> 01:33.600
(barks)

01:33.633 --> 01:36.133
OH, I'M COMING.

01:36.167 --> 01:38.067
I'M COMING, DOC.
JUST HANG ON.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.833
JUST HOLD IT
UNTIL I GET THERE, PLEASE.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.200
I'LL WALK HIM.

01:41.233 --> 01:43.133
(Doc whines)
NO, IT'S MY TURN.

01:43.167 --> 01:45.067
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL GO WALK DOC.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.600
YOU JUST SLEEP.

01:46.633 --> 01:48.533
IT'LL BE GOOD--
THE FRESH OUTDOORS,

01:48.567 --> 01:51.067
SPRING MORNING.
(Doc barks)

01:51.100 --> 01:53.467
YOU JUST SLEEP.
OKAY.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.233
UNLESS YOU WANT TO TALK.

01:55.267 --> 01:56.533
OH, GOD. HERE IT COMES.

01:56.567 --> 01:58.400
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
WE HAVE TO TALK.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.333
I'M JUST SAYING IF YOU WANT
TO TALK, WE COULD.

02:00.367 --> 02:01.400
YOU KNOW, I CAN START,
YOU KNOW?

02:01.433 --> 02:03.467
AND--AND THEN YOU CAN TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING... AT ALL

02:03.500 --> 02:05.367
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY
FOR ME

02:05.400 --> 02:07.833
TO INTERPRET "GIRL FLIP OUT"
INTO NORMAL CONVERSATION.

02:07.867 --> 02:10.733
IT'S JUST THAT USUALLY...
YOU START YELLING, YOU KNOW,

02:10.767 --> 02:11.967
WHEN YOU GET MAD.

02:12.067 --> 02:14.100
THEN MARK SHOWED UP YESTERDAY
AND YOU HAVEN'T YELLED YET.

02:14.133 --> 02:15.700
I'M TRYING
TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE.

02:15.733 --> 02:17.600
SO JUST GO, YELL.
I DON'T WANT TO YELL.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.200
YOU DON'T WANT TO YELL? YOU?
I JUST WANT TO SLEEP.

02:20.233 --> 02:22.133
AND DOC, HE WANTS TO PEE,

02:22.167 --> 02:24.233
PREFERABLY NOT INSIDE
THIS TRAILER.

02:24.267 --> 02:26.500
(whispers) OKAY.

02:26.533 --> 02:29.067
***

02:29.100 --> 02:31.067
YOU COULD YELL
IF YOU WANT TO.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.067
ADDISON--
I CAN TAKE IT.
I'M READY.

02:33.067 --> 02:35.700
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.
(Doc barks)

02:35.733 --> 02:36.767
COME ON. COME ON.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.533
WHAT I'M SAYING IS...

02:40.567 --> 02:44.333
WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.

02:44.367 --> 02:47.167
WHAT COMES AROUND
GOES AROUND.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.633
***

02:55.100 --> 02:57.233
HEY.

02:57.267 --> 02:58.767
MORNING.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.067
MORNING.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.433
WHAT?
SO I SLEPT WITH HIM AGAIN.

03:07.467 --> 03:08.633
SO I'M A BIG WHORE--

03:08.667 --> 03:10.567
A BIG, HORNY WHORE
WHO CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.267
CAN WE GET OVER
THE SHOCKED SILENCE ALREADY?

03:13.300 --> 03:15.400
IT'S KARMA,

03:15.433 --> 03:17.800
AND ANYWAY YOU SLICE IT...

03:17.833 --> 03:19.133
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:19.167 --> 03:21.767
KARMA SUCKS.

03:28.567 --> 03:32.800
50 BUCKS SAYS O'MALLEY
CAUGHT HER DOING MARK SLOAN.

03:34.367 --> 03:37.167
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THEM.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.100
ALL RIGHT, HE WALKED IN
ON HER DOING McDREAMY.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.633
DID I JUST CALL
THAT DUDE "McDREAMY"?

03:43.667 --> 03:45.700
OH, YOU KNOW YOU DID.

03:45.733 --> 03:47.633
AWESOME.
YOU ARE RUINING MY LIFE.

03:47.667 --> 03:48.800
GET A ROOM.

03:48.833 --> 03:50.633
GUYS...

03:50.667 --> 03:52.533
(George) EXCUSE ME.
OH, SORRY.

03:52.567 --> 03:55.433
WHAT'S, UH,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:55.467 --> 03:56.300
NOTHING.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.400
OH, YOU KNOW
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT ANYWAY.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.267
IF YOU TELL US,
MAYBE WE CAN HELP.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.233
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

04:02.267 --> 04:04.733
OH, THAT MEANS
THERE'S SOMETHING TO TELL.
COME ON.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.700
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

04:06.733 --> 04:08.067
WELL, HOW ABOUT GARDENIAS?

04:08.067 --> 04:10.567
LIKE MASSES AND MOUNTAINS
OF GARDENIAS.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.767
ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT BEES?

04:11.800 --> 04:13.467
OKAY, THAT'S WHY
I LOVE HIM.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.667
NO GARDENIAS.

04:15.700 --> 04:16.733
WHO WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT?

04:16.767 --> 04:19.567
KEITH PAULUS, ADMITTED
LAST NIGHT WITH CHEST PAINS.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.467
STATUS POST ACUTE M.I.
NO FAMILY

04:21.500 --> 04:23.267
OR PERSONAL HISTORY
OF HEART DISEASE,

04:23.300 --> 04:25.333
NO CARDIAC RISK FACTORS.
HE'S HEALTHY AS A HORSE.

04:25.367 --> 04:28.100
A HORSE WHO'S IN BED AFTER
JUST HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

04:28.133 --> 04:29.733
SEE, ANY MINUTE, I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA TELL US

04:29.767 --> 04:31.133
THAT THIS WAS A FALSE ALARM

04:31.167 --> 04:32.833
AND IT JUST SEEMED
THAT HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

04:32.867 --> 04:34.533
SHE TALKS
WHEN SHE GETS NERVOUS.

04:34.567 --> 04:35.600
I UNDERSTAND.

04:35.633 --> 04:37.100
MR. PAULUS, UNFORTUNATELY,

04:37.133 --> 04:39.767
THE SCAN SHOWS WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A MASS AROUND YOUR HEART,

04:39.800 --> 04:43.267
A VERY, VERY LARGE MASS.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.267
MASS. OKAY.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.233
IS THAT CODE FOR TUMOR?

04:47.267 --> 04:49.233
OKAY, THAT'S ABSURD.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A TUMOR.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.133
HE'S INCREDIBLY HEALTHY.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.700
WE WON'T KNOW
WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLORATION,

04:53.733 --> 04:56.800
WHICH IS WHY I'D LIKE
TO DO AN ANGIOGRAM TODAY.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.333
OKAY, GOOD.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.500
DID MEREDITH SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE ABOUT ANYTHING?

05:09.533 --> 05:11.300
NO. ARE YOU GONNA DISH?

05:11.333 --> 05:13.233
NO. NO.

05:13.267 --> 05:15.267
THEN LEAVE ME ALONE.
I'M WORKING.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.067
WELL, GOOD. BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, EVER.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.200
FINE, THEN DON'T.

05:19.233 --> 05:22.067
I'M JUST SAYIN'...

05:34.500 --> 05:38.467
ARE YOU...
THAT'S WEIRD.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.333
DO YOU NEED
TO THROW UP AGAIN?
NO.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.233
BECAUSE THERE IS NO SHAME
I NEEDING TO THROW UP.

05:44.267 --> 05:46.167
(boy) DAD, I DON'T NEED
TO THROW UP.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.700
SHAWN BEGLEITER, 11 YEARS OLD,
IN FOR INTRACTABLE VOMITING

05:48.733 --> 05:49.733
AFTER A MINOR HEAD INJURY.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.667
OH, I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
SAY "MINOR."

05:51.700 --> 05:53.567
HE WAS HIT IN THE HEAD
WITH A BASEBALL.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.667
YEAH, PLAYING FIRST,
AND THIS LITTLE DOLT

05:55.700 --> 05:58.267
HARRY DOPPELHAMMER
HIT THIS LINE DRIVE

05:58.300 --> 06:00.200
OUT OF NOWHERE
WHEN SHAWN WASN'T LOOKING.

06:00.233 --> 06:01.800
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS MY FAULT.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.467
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
LET HIM PLAY LITTLE LEAGUE.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.133
IT IS CLEARLY
A DANGEROUS SPORT.

06:05.167 --> 06:06.667
RICK, LET'S
LET THE DOCTOR'S TALK.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.233
THEY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, MICHAEL.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.467
I'M TELLING THEM
WHAT HAPPENED.
SHAWN'S GONNA BE OKAY.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.533
RIGHT?
YEAH, WE HAVE TO KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON HIM.

06:13.567 --> 06:14.733
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS?

06:14.767 --> 06:16.667
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
COULD INDICATE ANYTHING

06:16.700 --> 06:19.467
FROM A CONCUSSION
TO INTERCRANIAL HEMORRHAGING.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.667
I'D START WITH AN H&P,
DO A THOROUGH NEURO EXAM

06:21.700 --> 06:23.533
AND GET A C.T.
GOOD.

06:23.567 --> 06:26.400
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T NEED
TO THROW UP?
DAD...

06:33.100 --> 06:34.467
TUCKER.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.700
DR. SHEPHERD.

06:35.733 --> 06:39.733
HOW, UM...
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

06:41.300 --> 06:43.267
I'M FEELIN' GREAT.
I GET TO GO HOME.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.400
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
IS MIRANDA GONNA MEET YOU THERE?

06:46.433 --> 06:48.167
NO, I'M DRIVING HIM THERE.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.167
OH, THANK GOD. AHEM.
YOU OKAY?

06:51.200 --> 06:53.633
I NEED A CONSULT.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.333
I'M NOT WORKING.

06:55.367 --> 06:59.233
AHEM. MIRANDA...
I NEED A CONSULT.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
OH, NO.
OH, PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

07:05.533 --> 07:08.433
ADDISON,
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.633
YOU HAVE POISON OAK

07:10.667 --> 07:14.133
WHERE NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE
POISON OAK.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.200
LIKE I WAS SAYING...
OH, GOD.

07:17.233 --> 07:23.400
PAYBACK'S A BITCH.

07:25.533 --> 07:26.533
IT'S OFFICIAL, MY FRIEND.

07:26.567 --> 07:28.400
YOU GET TO GO HOME.
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

07:28.433 --> 07:31.267
I THANK YOU,
MY WIFE THANKS YOU,

07:31.300 --> 07:34.067
MY SON THANKS YOU.
HEY, WHERE IS YOUR WIFE?

07:34.067 --> 07:35.800
YOU CAN'T DRIVE
FOR ANOTHER SIX WEEKS.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.167
DR. SHEPHERD'S A STICKLER

07:37.200 --> 07:39.167
WHEN IT COMES TO
HIS PATIENTS' RECOVERY.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.200
I SHOULD KNOW.
HEY, RICHARD.

07:40.233 --> 07:43.067
I WANTED TO STOP IN
BEFORE BAILEY TOOK YOU HOME.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.633
WELL, SHE'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

07:44.667 --> 07:48.300
UH, YOUR WIFE CAME IN EARLIER,
SAID SHE NEEDED A CONSULT.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.533
CONSULT? WELL, BAILEY'S ON
MATERNITY LEAVE.

07:50.567 --> 07:52.567
SEEMED LIKE SOME KIND
OF PERSONAL CONSULT.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.467
IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T MIND WAITING.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.100
ALL RIGHT, I'M BACK.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.767
YOU DIDN'T MAKE UP A CHART
DID YOU?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.733
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT
MAKE UP A CHART.

08:00.767 --> 08:02.667
I DID NOT MAKE UP A CHART,
WHICH MEANS

08:02.700 --> 08:04.800
WE ARE OFFICIALLY STEALING
THIS CALAMINE LOTION

08:04.833 --> 08:06.500
AND THESE GLOVES.

08:06.533 --> 08:08.433
YOU TAKE IT UP
WITH THE CHIEF.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.433
THE CHIEF? NO, NO. I CANNOT
TAKE THIS UP WITH THE CHIEF.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.800
I'M JUST KIDDING.
OKAY, DID I MAKE JOKES
WITH YOU

08:12.833 --> 08:14.733
WHEN YOU WERE IN
THE STIRRUPS?

08:14.767 --> 08:17.667
NO, YOU DID NOT,
AND I'M APOLOGIZING.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.267
OH, MY.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.567
WHAT?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.500
THESE BLISTERS ARE GROWING
AWFULLY FAST.

08:22.533 --> 08:24.800
I GOTTA GIVE YOU
A SHOT OF STEROIDS.
STEROIDS?

08:24.833 --> 08:27.800
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CASE
OF POISON OAK THIS BAD.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.767
OH!

08:29.800 --> 08:30.733
EW! GIRL, WHAT DID YOU--

08:30.767 --> 08:34.100
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
MIRANDA, THE CALAMINE!

08:34.133 --> 08:35.433
OH, RIGHT, SORRY.

08:35.467 --> 08:36.400
OH.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.500
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND O'MALLEY?
NOTHING.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.433
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
I'VE DONE WORSE.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.367
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I DID SOMETHING?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.367
HOW DO YOU KNOW
GEORGE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.300
BECAUSE BAMBI LOOKS PISSED
AND YOU LOOK GUILTY.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.233
HERE WE ARE.
COME ON, BUDDY.

08:48.267 --> 08:50.167
LET ME HELP YOU UP HERE.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.800
THERE YOU GO.

08:51.833 --> 08:54.100
FINE. I DID SOMETHING...

08:54.133 --> 08:56.167
A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE SOMETHING.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.533
ONE TIME, I PUT A RAW EGG
IN MY SOCK DRAWER FOR A MONTH,

08:59.567 --> 09:02.433
AND THEN I SMASHED IT
IN MY TEACHER'S GRADE BOOK.

09:02.467 --> 09:05.233
EW.
MY DADS WERE REALLY MAD.

09:05.267 --> 09:08.200
WELL, WHAT I DID
WAS WORSE THAN THAT.

09:08.233 --> 09:09.333
COOL.

09:09.367 --> 09:11.267
COOL.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.467
STOP POUTING.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.800
I'M NOT POUTING.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.700
OH, PLEASE. I DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU.

09:28.733 --> 09:30.267
I CAN FEEL YOU POUTING.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.200
WHATEVER MEREDITH DID,
IT WASN'T ON PURPOSE

09:32.233 --> 09:33.533
SO GET OVER IT ALREADY.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.267
AHEM.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.067
I'M NOT BEING INAPPROPRIATE.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.267
HE'S ACTING LIKE
SHE SKINNED HIS PUPPY.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.067
(whispers) YANG,
THAT'S NOT NICE.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.700
WELL, I'M NOT A NICE PERSON.

09:42.733 --> 09:45.067
IF YOU KNEW WHAT SHE DID,
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.800
NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

09:46.833 --> 09:50.400
WHAT I WANT IS TO ANALYZE
THIS ANGIOGRAM,

09:50.433 --> 09:51.567
BOOK THIS SUCKER INTO SURGERY

09:51.600 --> 09:53.300
AND EXCISE
HIS CARDIOTHORACIC MASS.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.433
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A MASS TO ME.

09:55.467 --> 09:58.433
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.267
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A MASS
IS ACTUALLY

10:01.300 --> 10:03.800
A CORONARY ARTERY ANEURYSM

10:03.833 --> 10:06.233
WITH A FISTULA INTO
ONE OF YOUR HEART CHAMBERS.

10:06.267 --> 10:08.800
IS IT, UH, EASY TO FIX?

10:08.833 --> 10:10.633
BEFORE YOU ANSWER
THAT QUESTION,

10:10.667 --> 10:12.600
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

10:12.633 --> 10:15.167
WE'RE--WE'RE IN LOVE
AND WE'RE GETTING MARRIED,

10:15.200 --> 10:16.400
AND WE'RE NOT SO YOUNG,

10:16.433 --> 10:17.667
SO WE'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME FOR THIS.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.367
I HAVE MY DRESS
AND EVERYONE'S COMING

10:19.400 --> 10:21.300
AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THE HAPPIEST DAY OF OUR LIVES,

10:21.333 --> 10:23.800
AND NOW THE ONLY REASON
THAT I'M TELLING YOU THIS

10:23.833 --> 10:26.100
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THIS LOOK ON YOUR FACE--

10:26.133 --> 10:27.633
THIS DARK, OMINOUS LOOK--

10:27.667 --> 10:29.667
AND WE'RE SILVER LINING
KIND OF PEOPLE.
(Keith) OH, HONEY.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.167
SO I JUST THOUGHT IT MIGHT
HELP IF YOU KNEW THAT.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.567
(Preston) DR. YANG,
WOULD YOU CLOSE THE DOOR?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.500
AHEM. WE CAN, UH,

10:36.533 --> 10:38.700
WE CAN OPERATE
ON THE ANEURYSM,

10:38.733 --> 10:40.400
TRY TO REPAIR IT.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.633
BUT THIS TYPE OF LESION
IS EXTREMELY DELICATE.

10:42.667 --> 10:47.833
THE CHANCES OF IT RUPTURING
IN SURGERY ARE HIGH.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.200
WHAT KEEPS IT FROM RUPTURING

10:49.233 --> 10:51.667
IF I'M JUST WALKING DOWN
THE STREET?

10:51.700 --> 10:53.100
NOTHING.

10:53.133 --> 10:55.567
THE RISKS ARE HIGH
EITHER WAY.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.033
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
THIS...

10:58.067 --> 10:59.567
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.767
IT'S OKAY, AMY.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.667
NO, IT'S NOT.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.600
I KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO PROCESS,

11:04.633 --> 11:07.100
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO OPERATE,

11:07.133 --> 11:09.067
WE NEED TO DO IT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.233
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

11:10.267 --> 11:12.800
HONEY.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.633
WE'RE GETTING--
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.067
HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.467
THEY SEEM LIKE
A REALLY NICE COUPLE.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.667
THEY DO.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.433
THEY DON'T SEEM LIKE
THEY DESERVE THIS.
THEY NEVER DO.

11:27.467 --> 11:29.367
REALLY? I GUESS I'M--
I JUST THINK--

11:29.400 --> 11:30.567
I BELIEVE IN KARMA.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.500
YOU KNOW, GOOD PEOPLE
DESERVE GOOD THINGS.

11:32.533 --> 11:35.167
AT LEAST, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT THAT'S THE WAY

11:35.200 --> 11:36.700
THE UNIVERSE WORKED.

11:36.733 --> 11:40.267
HOW CAN YOU THINK THAT
AND PRACTICE MEDICINE?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.267
WHY? I'M NOT SAYING THAT
EVERYBODY WHO GETS SICK

11:42.300 --> 11:44.200
OR EVERYBODY WHO DIES
IS BAD.

11:44.233 --> 11:46.633
I'M JUST--
I'M JUST SAYIN' THAT

11:46.667 --> 11:48.833
I THINK THAT
THERE'S A BALANCE.

11:48.867 --> 11:51.333
OR THAT THERE SHOULD BE
A BAL--I JUST--

11:51.367 --> 11:53.400
THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT
OF BALANCE. THAT'S...

11:53.433 --> 11:55.100
GOOD GOD, O'MALLEY.

11:55.133 --> 11:58.433
WHAT THE HELL
DID GREY DO TO YOU?

12:01.267 --> 12:04.700
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN WHEN
YOU SAY BLOOD IN THE VENTRICLE?
OH, MY GOD,

12:04.733 --> 12:06.267
H-HIS BRAIN IS BLEEDING?

12:06.300 --> 12:07.633
(Derek) WELL,
THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.067
IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF BLOOD.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.567
AND THESE INJURIES
OFTEN RESOLVE THEMSELVES.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.600
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?
WILL HE LOSE I.Q. POINTS?

12:14.633 --> 12:16.600
BECAUSE HE IS VERY SMART,
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

12:16.633 --> 12:19.067
HE LIKES TO BE SMART.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.233
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD SUE THAT
LITTLE BRUTE THAT HIT THE BALL?

12:21.267 --> 12:23.333
OR THE COACH--
SHOULD WE SUE THE COACH?

12:23.367 --> 12:26.133
SHAWN LOVES THE COACH.
SHAWN'S BRAIN IS BLEEDING.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.100
RICK...

12:27.133 --> 12:28.700
DAD, I'M FINE. JEEZ.

12:28.733 --> 12:31.067
YEAH, HE'S AWAKE, ALERT,
MINIMAL PAIN.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.667
THESE ARE ALL GOOD SIGNS.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.467
I JUST WANT TO MONITOR HIM OVER
THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.233
OKAY. GOOD. YOU HEAR THAT,
SHAWN? GOOD SIGNS.

12:38.267 --> 12:40.167
THAT MEANS, HONEY,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SCARED.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.667
I'M NOT.
I AM.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.533
WE KNOW.
WE KNOW.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.067
OH, THEY PAGED YOU, TOO?
MUST BE SOMETHING BIG.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.200
NOBODY PAGED ME.

12:51.233 --> 12:53.133
THEY DIDN'T?
CAN YOU TIE THIS?

12:53.167 --> 12:55.067
NOBODY PAGED YOU EITHER.
YES, THEY DID.
I JUST GOT A PAGE.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.600
DID YOU PAGE ME?

12:56.633 --> 12:58.600
ALEX... OH!

12:58.633 --> 13:00.067
OOH.

13:00.067 --> 13:01.433
YOU FREE TONIGHT?

13:01.467 --> 13:02.767
I MIGHT BE. (chuckles)

13:02.800 --> 13:05.100
HEY, ARE YOU STILL WORKING
WITH MEREDITH?

13:05.133 --> 13:07.067
I'M TRYING TO KISS YOU.
(siren whoops)

13:07.067 --> 13:09.333
YEAH, BUT DID SHE MENTION
ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

13:09.367 --> 13:10.833
BETWEEN HER AND GEORGE
BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO GET

13:10.867 --> 13:12.400
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT--
(man) 35 YEAR OLD MALE,

13:12.433 --> 13:14.700
SHORTNESS OF BREATH,
HAD A SYNCOPAL EPISODE.

13:14.733 --> 13:17.167
PULSE IS RAPID
AND IRREGULAR.
OH, MY GOD. IT'S DENNY.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.067
WHAT?
IT'S DENNY.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.367
WHAT DID HE GET
IN THE FIELD?

13:28.400 --> 13:30.433
HEY, THIS IS MY PATIENT
UNTIL I SIGN HIM OVER OT YOU.
I KNOW THIS GUY.

13:30.467 --> 13:33.133
HE'S ON THE TOP OF
THE DONOR LIST FOR A NEW HEART.

13:33.167 --> 13:35.567
THAT MAKES HIM SURGICAL.
I'VE ALREADY PAGED DR. BURKE

13:35.600 --> 13:36.833
AND HE'S ON HIS WAY,
SO YOU BETTER START SIGNING NOW.

13:36.867 --> 13:37.767
WHAT DID HE GET IN THE FIELD?
WE GAVE HIM 40 OF FUROSEMIDE.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.167
RHYTHM DIDN'T CHANGE
AFTER 6 OF ADENOSINE.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.700
WHAT DO WE GOT?
IT'S DENNY.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.667
DENNY?
(Alex)
TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.733
ACUTE DYSRHYTMIA AND C.H.F.
VITALS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

13:46.767 --> 13:48.667
(Preston)
HIS HEART RHYTHM IS A MESS.
HE'S IN HEART FAILURE.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.433
BISOPROLOL CAN REDUCE
THE CHANCE OF MORTALITY.

13:50.467 --> 13:53.767
CAN WE TRY THAT?
WHAT ABOUT ACE INHIBITORS?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.333
AND DIGOXIN--
SOMEBODY LOAD HIM WITH DIG.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.267
STEVENS, SLOW DOWN.
HE'S HOLDING ON.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.633
BARELY, BUT HE'S HOLDING ON.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING MORE
WE CAN DO?

13:59.667 --> 14:02.067
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
MORE WE CAN DO.
THE BEST WE CAN DO
IS GET HIM UP TO C.I.C.U.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.833
AND WAIT AND SEE
IF HIS HEART WILL STABILIZE.

14:03.867 --> 14:05.567
IZZIE, WE SHOULD--
WE SHOULD GO.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.700
NO, YOU GO. I'M--
I'M GONNA STAY.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.200
(monitors beeping irregularly)

14:15.633 --> 14:18.133
NO. I--YES, YES.

14:18.167 --> 14:21.333
I SEE YOU.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.300
NO, YOU DON'T.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.067
YOUR HUSBAND WAS DISCHARGED
OVER AN HOUR AGO.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.800
I'M NOT HERE.
GO HOME.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.300
YOU'RE NOT WORKING TODAY.
YOU'RE ON MATERNITY LEAVE.

14:30.333 --> 14:33.100
EXACTLY.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.567
HAVE YOU MADE YOUR DECISION?

14:38.600 --> 14:41.433
WH--OH.
UH, ABOUT THE SURGERY.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.233
UM...

14:43.267 --> 14:46.167
NO, WE'RE STILL, UH,
WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.267
UH, WE WERE THINKING
MAYBE WE SHOULD

14:48.300 --> 14:50.700
WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE WEDDING.
UM...

14:53.067 --> 14:54.400
SO--SO HOW IS HE?

14:54.433 --> 14:55.800
UH, HE'S PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME.

14:55.833 --> 14:57.800
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

14:57.833 --> 15:00.500
UH, NO. NOT REALLY.
IT...

15:00.533 --> 15:02.067
SEE, WITH YOUR CONDITION,

15:02.067 --> 15:04.467
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY
UNTIL YOU'RE NOT.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.367
AND IF YOU OPT AGAINST
THE SURGERY

15:06.400 --> 15:09.067
AND IF YOU LEAVE NOW,
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.200
YOU MIGHT MAKE IT TO
YOUR WEDDING, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT,

15:11.233 --> 15:12.767
AND YOU WON'T KNOW.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.733
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE OKAY
UNTIL YOU DIE.

15:14.767 --> 15:17.067
(laughs) YOU'RE TRYING
TO COMFORT ME?

15:17.100 --> 15:20.733
NO. I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU
TO LET DR. BURKE OPERATE.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.633
SO THAT HE CAN DIE TODAY?

15:22.667 --> 15:25.367
HE MIGHT DIE TODAY ANYWAY,

15:25.400 --> 15:27.300
BUT DR. BURKE
IS THE VERY BEST,

15:27.333 --> 15:30.467
AND HE'S
YOUR VERY BEST CHANCE.

15:32.800 --> 15:36.367
(Preston speaking
indistinctly)

15:38.633 --> 15:42.633
STEVENS,
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.400
OH, IT'S JUST...

15:45.433 --> 15:47.400
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

15:47.433 --> 15:49.433
YOU KNOW,
IT'S REALLY NOT FAIR.

15:49.467 --> 15:50.400
(sighs)

15:50.433 --> 15:53.433
WE TREAT... JERKS
ALL THE TIME.

15:53.467 --> 15:55.133
PATCH 'EM UP,
SEND 'EM OFF,

15:55.167 --> 15:57.233
WHETHER THEY DESERVE IT
OR NOT.

15:57.267 --> 15:58.800
NO BIG DEAL.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.500
BUT... DENNY...

16:01.533 --> 16:03.433
HE'S A GOOD GUY,
DR. BURKE.

16:03.467 --> 16:06.333
HE'S A... REALLY GOOD GUY
WITH A BAD HEART

16:06.367 --> 16:08.667
AND ALL WE CAN DO FOR HIM
IS WAIT.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.233
WELL, BELIEVE ME. I KNOW.

16:10.267 --> 16:12.567
I'VE BEEN TREATING DENNY
A LONG TIME.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.233
HE DOESN'T DESERVE THIS.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.500
NO, WHAT HE DESERVES IS
THE BEST CARDIAC CARE,

16:16.533 --> 16:19.100
AND WE'RE GIVING HIM THAT.

16:19.133 --> 16:22.167
YOU REALLY LIKE HIM,
DON'T YOU?

16:24.300 --> 16:27.067
HE JUST...

16:27.067 --> 16:30.500
HE JUST...
DOESN'T DESERVE THIS.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.233
OKAY.

16:35.267 --> 16:36.367
AAH.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.300
ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THAT?
(groans)

16:38.333 --> 16:40.100
IS THAT ICE PACK HELPING?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.067
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:42.067 --> 16:46.200
MIND IF I ASK HOW EXACTLY
THIS HAPPENED?

16:46.233 --> 16:48.067
I SLEPT WITH MARK!

16:48.067 --> 16:50.833
OH! AND HE HAD
POISON OAK ON...

16:50.867 --> 16:52.767
NO! I SLEPT WITH MARK
A YEAR AGO,

16:52.800 --> 16:54.567
AND APPARENTLY,
THIS IS WHAT I GET.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.533
YEAH.

16:55.567 --> 16:57.267
BUT HOW DID YOU--

16:57.300 --> 17:00.567
I LIVE IN A TRAILER.
I HAVE MEREDITH GREY'S DOG.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.500
AND I WENT OUTSIDE
TO THROW A STICK,

17:02.533 --> 17:05.300
AND I HAD TO PEE,
SO I SQUATTED.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.833
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO INSIDE

17:06.867 --> 17:08.367
AND WAKE UP MY HUSBAND

17:08.400 --> 17:11.267
BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE'S BEEN
LOOKING AT ME SINCE YESTERDAY.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.200
I JUST WANTED A FEW MINUTES
OF PEACE,

17:13.233 --> 17:15.467
AND THIS IS WHAT I GET.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.400
NO, NO, NO, DON'T CRY.
THIS IS WHAT I GET!

17:17.433 --> 17:19.733
DON'T CRY. PLEASE DON'T CRY.
PLEASE DON'T CRY.
(cries)

17:19.767 --> 17:22.567
STOP. YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME...

17:22.600 --> 17:23.700
(cries)

17:23.733 --> 17:26.100
(groans)

17:26.133 --> 17:28.233
OH, LACTATE.

17:28.267 --> 17:30.433
CAN YOU
GIVE SOME GAUZE?
I'M SORRY.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.333
OH, MIRANDA, I'M SORRY.
QUICK, GIVE ME SOME GAUZE.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.733
I'M SORRY.
(knock on door)

17:34.767 --> 17:35.833
STOP. SHH.

17:35.867 --> 17:36.800
(knock)

17:36.833 --> 17:38.767
(Addison cries)

17:38.800 --> 17:40.100
CAN I HELP YOU, CHIEF?

17:40.133 --> 17:42.067
DR. BAILEY...

17:42.100 --> 17:43.833
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' IN THERE,

17:43.867 --> 17:45.633
BUT WHATEVER IT IS...

17:45.667 --> 17:48.633
OH.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.267
OH. OH, NO.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.233
UM... (clears throat)

17:52.267 --> 17:54.500
DR. BAILEY, UH, I'M...

17:54.533 --> 17:56.100
SORRY.

17:56.133 --> 17:59.233
UH... CARRY ON.

17:59.267 --> 18:01.133
(clears throat)

18:02.767 --> 18:04.100
OKAY, FILL ME IN.

18:04.133 --> 18:06.367
I WAS DOING
HIS ROUTINE NEURO CHECK.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.367
I NOTICED HE WAS ALTERED.
MOST LIKELY A CLOT.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.733
ACUTE HYDROCEPHALUS.

18:09.767 --> 18:12.500
OH, DAMN. WE NEED TO REMOVE
THE PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.600
CRANIAL ACCESS KIT'S READY.

18:14.633 --> 18:16.433
"CRANIAL ACCESS"?
ACCESS TO SHAWN'S BRAIN?

18:16.467 --> 18:19.333
DEBBIE, GET THEM OUT OF HERE.
GENTLEMEN.

18:19.367 --> 18:21.067
RICK.
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.067
LOOK, I AM ABOUT TO DRILL A HOLE
INTO YOUR SON'S SKULL.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.267
YOU DON'T WANT TO WATCH THIS.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.467
HE'S OUR SON.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.533
RICK--
WE ARE NOT LEAVING
HIS SIDE.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.567
15 BLADE, PLEASE. I WANT
THE CATHETER READY TO DRAIN

18:30.600 --> 18:31.767
AS SOON AS I PENETRATE
THE DURA.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.733
DO NOT PANIC.

18:34.767 --> 18:36.733
THE DRILL.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.467
(Derek) I'M ALMOST IN.

18:49.533 --> 18:51.433
THERE, LOOK AT THAT.

18:51.467 --> 18:53.333
CATHETER, QUICKLY.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.467
(Meredith) PUPILS REACTIVE.
PRESSURE'S STABILIZING.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.167
IS HE OKAY?
I WANT NEURO CHECKS
EVERY HOUR

18:59.200 --> 19:00.733
AND INCREASE THE SUPERVISION.

19:00.767 --> 19:02.700
WE'RE IN THE CLEAR FOR NOW.
WE'RE IN THE CLEAR?

19:02.733 --> 19:04.500
YOU GUYS DID WELL.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.533
OH, I HAVE A HEADACHE.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.433
WELCOME BACK, LITTLE MAN.

19:08.467 --> 19:09.667
(pager beeps)

19:09.700 --> 19:11.200
"9-1-1."

19:14.400 --> 19:19.333
DAD, YOU LOOK WHITE.
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:19.367 --> 19:21.533
(Rick vomits)

19:21.567 --> 19:24.100
OH, GREAT.

19:25.067 --> 19:26.367
YES.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.100
(monitors beeping irregularly)

19:30.567 --> 19:33.167
YOU GOT HERE QUICK.
WE GOTTA GET HIS HEART RATE
UNDER CONTROL.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.433
PUSH 300 OF AMIODARONE, NOW.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.233
STATUS?
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
HIS HEART'S BEATING TOO FAST.

19:38.267 --> 19:41.167
IF WE CAN'T GET IT
TO SLOW DOWN, THEN...
IT'LL GIVE OUT.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.133
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY
SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.800
PUSH 5 OF MORPHINE.

19:46.833 --> 19:48.833
IZZIE.

19:48.867 --> 19:51.067
YOU'RE AWAKE.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.800
HEY. I WAS HOPING
I MIGHT GET TO SEE YOU.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.733
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING US
PRETTY HARD AROUND HERE.

19:55.767 --> 19:58.600
THE THINGS I HAVE TO DO
TO GET A GIRL'S ATTENTION.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.333
DENNY, WE'RE ABOUT TO SEND
A SERIES

20:00.367 --> 20:02.233
OF ELECTRIC CURRENTS
THROUGH YOUR BODY.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.200
HOPEFULLY THE SHOCKS
WILL BE ENOUGH

20:04.233 --> 20:06.733
TO SLOW YOUR HEART RATE
BACK TO NORMAL.
I'LL BE HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

20:06.767 --> 20:09.667
THIS GONNA HURT?
(Preston) IT WON'T BE FUN.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.667
I GUESS MAYBE YOU OUGHTA
HOLD MY HAND THEN, HUH?

20:12.700 --> 20:15.333
YOU MIND IF I HANDLE
THE PADDLES?

20:15.367 --> 20:16.767
BE MY GUEST.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.433
READY?

20:19.467 --> 20:20.567
YEAH, HIT ME.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.367
CLEAR.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.367
AAH!

20:23.400 --> 20:25.067
(groans)

20:25.100 --> 20:26.333
NO CHANGE.

20:26.367 --> 20:28.200
TRY IT AT 100.

20:28.233 --> 20:30.133
CLEAR.

20:30.167 --> 20:32.100
AAH!

20:32.133 --> 20:33.633
OHH.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.667
(pants) HOLY SMOKE.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.533
(beeping slows)

20:39.567 --> 20:41.700
DENNY, YOU ARE A LUCKY MAN.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.733
OH. OH, DOC, I OUGHTA
KICK YOUR ASS

20:43.767 --> 20:46.067
FOR MAKING ME YELL LIKE A BABY

20:46.100 --> 20:48.267
IN FRONT OF THE GIRL
I'M TRYIN' TO IMPRESS, MAN.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.233
OH, JEEZ.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.233
(Denny) OH.

20:51.267 --> 20:52.533
TAKE CARE, MAN.

20:57.267 --> 20:58.633
DR. BAILEY.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.567
DR. BAILEY!
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.500
UH, I'M A LITTLE DISTRACTED
RIGHT NOW.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.333
OH, YES.
I'VE BEEN PAGING YOU.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.267
I'M NOT ON CALL.
I'M ON MATERNITY LEAVE.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.167
I'VE BEEN PAGING MY WIFE
AS WELL,

21:08.200 --> 21:09.567
BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN
ANSWERING EITHER.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.333
YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
JUST BECAUSE I KNOW
DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD.

21:12.367 --> 21:15.300
SOME THINGS YOU JUST
DON'T GET TO KNOW, NOT FROM ME.

21:15.333 --> 21:16.400
AND, REALLY, YOU DON'T
WANNA KNOW.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.333
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
WHERE SHE IS.

21:18.367 --> 21:20.533
I SAVED YOUR HUSBAND'S LIFE.
SHE SAVED MY BABY.

21:20.567 --> 21:23.400
SO BABY TRUMPS HUSBAND?
MM.

21:23.433 --> 21:26.167
BABY TRUMPS HUSBAND?

21:49.733 --> 21:51.800
HEY, AMY.

21:51.833 --> 21:56.433
THE WEB SITE SAID THAT
YOU SHOULD SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS.

21:56.467 --> 21:57.633
I'M SORRY?

21:57.667 --> 21:59.567
WELL, JUST IN CASE
SOMETHING HAPPENS,

21:59.600 --> 22:01.267
YOU KNOW, TO HAVE THEM.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.133
I HAVE ALL OF OURS
RIGHT HERE.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.067
I'VE GOT, YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT MY DRESS

22:05.100 --> 22:06.833
AND THE BAND, AND I'VE GOT
THE BALLROOM DEPOSIT

22:06.867 --> 22:07.967
AND THE HONEYMOON.

22:08.067 --> 22:10.733
YOU KNOW, MY MOM SAID I
SHOULDN'T, YOU KNOW, KEEP THEM.

22:10.767 --> 22:12.667
SAID IT WAS BAD LUCK.
IT WAS--IT WAS--

22:12.700 --> 22:15.500
IT WAS TEMPTING FATE.

22:15.533 --> 22:17.533
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

22:17.567 --> 22:19.700
Y-YOU HAVE A LIFE.

22:19.733 --> 22:22.400
YOU--YOU FALL IN LOVE,
YOU MAKE PLANS,

22:22.433 --> 22:25.067
YOU HAVE FANTASIES...

22:27.167 --> 22:32.067
AND NONE OF THEM INVOLVE
ALL OF THEM ENDING

22:32.067 --> 22:34.667
IN A BLINK OF THE EYE.

22:43.733 --> 22:46.600
(whistles)

22:46.633 --> 22:48.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.367
HIDING.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.300
ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU SLEPT WITH O'MALLEY.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.700
GET OVER IT ALREADY.

22:53.733 --> 22:55.800
HE TOLD YOU?

22:55.833 --> 22:57.800
UH... NO.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.367
(laughs)

23:02.400 --> 23:03.833
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

23:03.867 --> 23:06.467
UH, I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I SHOULD BE SURPRISED.
WHY NOT?

23:06.500 --> 23:08.233
BECAUSE WHEN YOUR LIFE
IS SUCKING,

23:08.267 --> 23:10.167
YOU GET DRUNK AND SLEEP WITH
INAPPROPRIATE MEN.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.833
IT'S YOUR THING. WHATEVER.
I FIND IT CHARMING.

23:12.867 --> 23:14.400
YOU SLEEP WITH
INAPPROPRIATE WOMEN

23:14.433 --> 23:16.133
WHEN YOU'RE SOBER.

23:16.167 --> 23:18.767
ONE INAPPROPRIATE WOMAN,
AND IZZIE FORGAVE ME FOR THAT.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.667
O'MALLEY--HE'S NOT GONNA
GET OVER THIS.
IZZIE HASN'T FORGIVEN YOU.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.467
YES, SHE HAS.
WE'RE TOGETHER.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.400
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
IZZIE MAY BE SLEEPING WITH YOU,

23:25.433 --> 23:27.700
BUT SHE'LL NEVER SEE YOU
THE WAY SHE SAW YOU

23:27.733 --> 23:30.267
BEFORE YOU SLEPT WITH OLIVIA.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO PISS ME OFF?

23:30.300 --> 23:32.133
YOU'RE TRYING TO SUGGEST
THAT IT'S FORGIVABLE

23:32.167 --> 23:33.433
FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH OLIVIA

23:33.467 --> 23:36.067
BUT NOT FORGIVABLE
FOR ME TO SLEEP WITH GEORGE.
YOU TOLD HIM?

23:36.100 --> 23:38.333
I CA--
GEORGE.

23:38.367 --> 23:40.267
WOW, WHEN I'M WRONG
ABOUT SOMEONE...
NO, I--

23:40.300 --> 23:42.133
I AM REALLY WRONG.
NO, GEORGE!

23:42.167 --> 23:45.067
IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
DUDE, CHILL.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.200
YOU CHILL! YOU CHILL!

23:46.233 --> 23:48.133
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT GONNA CHILL.

23:48.167 --> 23:50.067
GEORGE, I--

23:50.067 --> 23:51.600
WHAT'S GOING ON?
FETUS IS FREAKING OUT.

23:51.633 --> 23:54.333
I CAN SEE THAT.
WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?

23:54.367 --> 23:56.500
YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE IS...
YOUR FRIEND, YOU KNOW.

23:56.533 --> 23:58.600
AT THE VERY LEAST,
THAT SHE'D RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY.

23:58.633 --> 24:00.333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:00.367 --> 24:02.100
BABY BOY IS FREAKING OUT.
SHE CAN SEE THAT.

24:02.133 --> 24:04.067
I CAN SEE THAT.
(both)
WHY IS HE FREAKING OUT?

24:04.067 --> 24:06.200
GEORGE,
CAN WE AT LEAST TALK?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK!

24:06.233 --> 24:06.933
NOT TO YOU!

24:06.967 --> 24:08.700
I WANTED TO KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT,

24:08.733 --> 24:10.700
AND IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
RUNNING AWAY FROM ME

24:10.733 --> 24:13.067
EVERY TIME YOU SEE ME,
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.800
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT CAN WE JUST TALK NOW?

24:14.833 --> 24:16.800
YOU WANT TO TALK NOW
BECAUSE YOU TOLD EVERYONE

24:16.833 --> 24:18.500
THAT WE HAD SEX!
SHH.

24:18.533 --> 24:20.700
YOU HAD SEX?
YOU HAD SEX WITH GEORGE?

24:20.733 --> 24:23.267
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM?
NO.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.433
DAMN IT!

24:25.467 --> 24:28.067
(Izzie) GEORGE!

24:28.067 --> 24:29.133
(George) OW!

24:29.167 --> 24:30.200
(Izzie) GEORGE!

24:30.233 --> 24:33.233
(laughs)

24:40.833 --> 24:44.067

24:45.133 --> 24:47.400
GO AWAY.

24:47.433 --> 24:50.500
***

24:53.133 --> 24:54.633
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?

24:54.667 --> 24:57.533
HE DISLOCATED HIS SHOULDER.
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

24:57.567 --> 25:00.200
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I MEANT.

25:01.667 --> 25:05.367
MEREDITH...
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS RIGHT,

25:05.400 --> 25:08.167
IF YOU CAN'T FIX THIS
WITH GEORGE,

25:08.200 --> 25:11.333
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IF IT COMES TO CHOOSING SIDES,

25:11.367 --> 25:12.800
I'M ON HIS.

25:18.633 --> 25:21.467

I MEAN, EVEN I DON'T BEAT UP
ON WEAKER KIDS.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.600
IT'S CHEAP.

25:25.633 --> 25:28.667
I DID A TERRIBLE THING.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.133
I DIDN'T...

25:32.167 --> 25:33.500
I DID A TERRIBLE THING.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.433
HE'S BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU
SINCE DAY ONE.

25:35.467 --> 25:38.367
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.500
WE ALL DO TERRIBLE THINGS.

25:44.533 --> 25:45.767
THANK YOU.

YOU'D BE LUCKY TO HAVE ME.

28:02.767 --> 28:03.700
HOW?

28:03.733 --> 28:06.267
HOW CAN WE BE FRIENDS?

28:06.300 --> 28:08.800
WE COULD, UH...

28:08.833 --> 28:10.833
HANG OUT.

28:10.867 --> 28:12.767
MM-HMM. I WALK DOC
EVERY OTHER MORNING,

28:12.800 --> 28:14.700
TIGER MOUNTAIN TRAIL.

28:14.733 --> 28:17.267
WE COULD MEET, HAVE COFFEE,
WATCH DOC PLAY AND...

28:17.300 --> 28:20.133
DISCUSS THE COMPLEX NATURE
OF OUR EXISTENCE.

28:20.167 --> 28:21.167
RIGHT.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.800
WE COULD. MIGHT BE FUN.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.733
I COULD BE YOUR FRIEND,
MEREDITH.

28:25.767 --> 28:26.700
NO.

28:26.733 --> 28:28.733
WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.267
I'M JUST ADDING NITRO.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.200
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE'S
STABLE NOW,

28:40.233 --> 28:41.667
YOUR C.H.F. HAS IMPROVED

28:41.700 --> 28:43.433
AND THE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
RESOLVED.

28:43.467 --> 28:46.267
I LIKE THE WAY YOU SAY
"FIBRILLATION."

28:46.300 --> 28:47.733
FIBRILLATION.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.700
TEASE.
(laughs)

28:49.733 --> 28:50.767
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

28:50.800 --> 28:55.500
YOU, UM...
DO YOU BELIEVE IN KARMA?

28:55.533 --> 28:58.400
UM... ACTUALLY, I DO.

28:58.433 --> 28:59.733
YEAH.

28:59.767 --> 29:02.067
I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE MINE.

29:02.067 --> 29:03.800
***

29:03.833 --> 29:06.500
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY, VERY GOOD TO DESERVE ME.

29:06.533 --> 29:08.567
I MUST HAVE.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.500
(laughs) OKAY.

29:11.533 --> 29:15.200
***

29:16.833 --> 29:18.733
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU.
WELL, DR. BAILEY--

29:18.767 --> 29:20.233
IF SHE WANTS HER PRIVACY,

29:20.267 --> 29:22.167
THEN WE WILL GIVE HER
HER PRIVACY, UNDERSTOOD?

29:22.200 --> 29:24.067
BUT DR. BAILEY PAGED ME.
SHE DID?

29:24.067 --> 29:25.400
YEAH.
I DID.

29:25.433 --> 29:28.300
AND I'M STILL NOT HERE.
I'M STILL ON MATERNITY LEAVE.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.267
AND I STILL NEED
SOME PRIVACY, CHIEF.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.133
IN HERE.

29:32.167 --> 29:35.067
***

29:35.067 --> 29:36.767
NO MOVING, NO PEEKING,
NO PULLING THE CURTAIN.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.100
JUST STAND THERE AND LET
HER TALK. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

29:39.133 --> 29:41.767
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?
I SAID,
"DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"

29:41.800 --> 29:44.067
I'M NOT MENTALLY CHALLENGED.
I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.833
(loudly) LET HER TALK.

29:46.867 --> 29:49.333
ADDISON, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

29:49.367 --> 29:51.300
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
PROMISE.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.500
OKAY, I PROMISE.

29:52.533 --> 29:55.400
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING,
AND... WHEN I DO,

29:55.433 --> 29:58.300
YOU DO NOT GET TO LAUGH,
AND YOU DO NOT GET TO GLOAT.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.067
WHY WOULD I GLOAT?

30:00.100 --> 30:03.167
I HAVE POISON OAK.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.300
WHAT?

30:05.333 --> 30:09.133
***

30:10.633 --> 30:13.033
HMM. YOU DO, INDEED,
HAVE POISON OAK.

30:13.067 --> 30:14.700
(sighs)
AHEM.

30:14.733 --> 30:18.167
SO ARE WE EVEN YET?
I MEAN, IS THIS BAD ENOUGH?

30:18.200 --> 30:22.533
HAVEN'T I REPAID MY DEBT
TO SOCIETY, DEREK?

30:22.567 --> 30:26.100
(laughs)

30:30.067 --> 30:31.600
OH!

30:31.633 --> 30:33.533
(Derek) ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.067
(Addison laughs)

30:35.100 --> 30:36.033
OH.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.433
(cooing)

30:37.467 --> 30:41.433
AHH. COME ON, TUCK.
LET'S TAKE YOUR DADDY HOME.

30:41.467 --> 30:44.200
YEAH? YEAH.

30:44.233 --> 30:47.733
OH, BIG BOY, BIG BOY.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.667
SHE REALLY DIDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT IT?

30:49.700 --> 30:51.600
NO. GOD,
IS THAT A BAD THING?

30:51.633 --> 30:52.733
WELL, SHE TELLS YOU
EVERYTHING.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.667
SO IT DIDN'T MATTER ENOUGH
TO HER TO EVEN TALK ABOUT.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.467
OKAY, GEORGE, THE PITY THING?
NOT GOOD.

30:58.500 --> 31:01.367
IF YOU WANT CRAPPY THINGS
TO STOP HAPPENING TO YOU,

31:01.400 --> 31:04.467
THEN STOP ACCEPTING CRAP
AND DEMAND SOMETHING MORE.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.633
HEY, AMY.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.833
OH, COULD YOU TELL,
UH, DR. BURKE

31:09.867 --> 31:11.767
THAT, UM, KEITH IS
GONNA HAVE THE SURGERY?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.333
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

31:13.367 --> 31:14.733
UM, I... I'M--I'M--

31:14.767 --> 31:16.667
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH
FOR THIS.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.767
HOLD IT, AMY.
I KNOW IT'S HARD,

31:18.800 --> 31:20.700
BUT YOUR FIANCé
IS GOING INTO SURGERY.

31:20.733 --> 31:23.467
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO BE HERE
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.833
NO, I WON'T. UM...

31:25.867 --> 31:29.233
HE'S NOT
MY FIANCé ANYMORE.

31:29.267 --> 31:31.467
YOU'RE LEAVING HIM?

31:31.500 --> 31:34.067
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH
FOR THIS.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.800
SO THE "IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH" PART

31:35.833 --> 31:38.700
OF YOUR VOWS, YOU'RE JUST
PLANNING TO LEAVE THOSE OUT?

31:38.733 --> 31:40.633
PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

31:40.667 --> 31:43.067
I DON'T LIKE THAT
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.467
I JUST KNOW THAT I'M NOT.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.067
GEORGE, HE'S CRASHING.
WHAT?

31:48.100 --> 31:49.267
(Cristina) HIS ANEURYSM
MAY HAVE BLOWN.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.733
PAGE DR. BURKE!

32:01.067 --> 32:02.367
(Preston) OKAY, EVERYONE.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.333
THIS IS ACTUALLY
A CORONARY ARTERY ANEURYSM...

32:05.367 --> 32:07.767
HE'S GONNA LIVE?

32:07.800 --> 32:10.700
BURKE'S A MIRACLE WORKER.

32:10.733 --> 32:13.600
DID YOU KNOW
THIS GUY'S FIANCéE LEFT HIM?

32:13.633 --> 32:17.267
SOUNDS LIKE HE DODGED
A BULLET.

32:17.300 --> 32:21.233
I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA
SEE IT THAT WAY.

32:24.067 --> 32:29.300
IF SHE CAN'T LOVE HIM BACK
THE WAY HE LOVES HER...

32:29.333 --> 32:31.733
THEN SHE DOESN'T DESERVE HIM.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.467
YOU HEARD ABOUT ME
AND MEREDITH?

32:35.500 --> 32:37.133
WELL, EVERYONE HEARD,
GEORGE.

32:37.167 --> 32:41.533
YOU WERE YELLING ABOUT IT
IN THE HALLWAY.

32:43.167 --> 32:45.800
IT MUST'VE SUCKED.
I'M SORRY.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.467
I'M SORRY.

32:52.700 --> 32:55.233
UM, IF--IF I MADE YOU FEEL

32:55.267 --> 32:58.167
ANYTHING LIKE I'M FEELING

MY SHIRT.

35:26.467 --> 35:28.267
THERE'S A SUITCASE--

EXCUSE ME.

35:39.233 --> 35:40.167
WHY?

35:40.200 --> 35:44.767
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU...

I DIDN'T KNOW
I DIDN'T WANT TO.

ALL THESE PERFECT THINGS,

35:56.200 --> 35:59.367

35:59.400 --> 36:01.533

36:01.567 --> 36:04.367
MAYBE I'VE JUST BEEN
OVERLOOKING

36:04.400 --> 36:08.067
WHAT'S BEEN IN FRONT OF ME.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.833

I DIDN'T WANT TO.

36:22.533 --> 36:24.267

OKAY.

CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO BACK
TO EVERYTHING THE WAY IT WAS?

36:35.800 --> 36:38.167
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GO BACK.

IN THE EYE

39:46.533 --> 39:48.100
I AM NOT.

39:51.733 --> 39:53.267
GOOD NIGHT.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.567
OH, GOOD NIGHT.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.467
(George) GOOD NIGHT.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.400
***

40:01.433 --> 40:04.100
I GUESS WE CAN'T REALLY
COMPLAIN ABOUT KARMA.

40:04.133 --> 40:07.200
IT'S NOT UNFAIR.
IT'S NOT UNEXPECTED.

40:07.233 --> 40:09.567
IT JUST...

40:09.600 --> 40:11.500
EVENS THE SCORE.

40:11.533 --> 40:15.333
***

40:15.367 --> 40:18.367
(barking)

40:22.533 --> 40:24.333
HEY, BOY. GOOD BOY.

40:24.367 --> 40:27.233
AND EVEN WHEN WE'RE ABOUT
TO DO SOMETHING WE KNOW

40:27.267 --> 40:29.500
WILL TEMPT KARMA
TO BITE US IN THE ASS,

40:33.067 --> 40:33.833
SO...

40:33.867 --> 40:35.633
SO...

40:35.667 --> 40:37.667
JUST FRIENDS.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.367
JUST FRIENDS.

40:39.400 --> 40:45.033
WE DO IT ANYWAY.
