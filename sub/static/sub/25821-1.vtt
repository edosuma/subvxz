WEBVTT

01:43.353 --> 01:45.219
Do you know how much
I love you?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.226
No.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.439
More than all the sand
on all the beaches

01:52.654 --> 01:54.145
in all the world.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.654
Describe her to me again.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.532
What was she like?

02:01.747 --> 02:05.616
She had long hair,
a beautiful smile.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.793
She wore a pretty blue dress
that shined in the sun.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.041
What about this?

02:11.256 --> 02:14.545
She loved it
and wore it every day.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.296
Just like you.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.803
Was she pretty?

02:19.014 --> 02:21.381
Very pretty.
The prettiest.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.136
Did she love us?

02:23.352 --> 02:24.763
Always.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.392
I am not going
to tell you both again.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.018
All right?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.440
I put you in here,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.268
and I want no talking.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.729
And I don't want you
to think about leaving

02:35.947 --> 02:37.154
this fucking closet.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.483
Do I make myself
crystal clear?

02:39.701 --> 02:41.442
Yes, Daddy.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.245
And don't make me come back
one more time,

02:45.457 --> 02:47.665
because if I do, I swear to God
I'll grab that necklace

02:47.876 --> 02:49.742
from around your fucking neck
so fast.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.002
Now cover your ears,
both of youse.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.600
I wish Mommy was here.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.223
Come on.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.974
Now I lay me down to sleep.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.773
Pray the Lord my soul to keep.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.941
If I should die before I wake,

03:15.153 --> 03:17.190
pray the Lord
my soul to take.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.114
God bless Mommy,
God bless Daddy,

03:20.325 --> 03:22.032
God bless the house.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.661
What are you doing, silly?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.316
You have a better chance
of going to heaven than I do.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.004
I wish you would
take me with you.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.933
I like it.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.195
Jordan.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.389
Ashley.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.137
Ashley.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.260
Unbelievable.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.054
Kids?

05:07.265 --> 05:08.801
You had kids in here?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.679
You son of a bitch.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.974
- What are you talking about?
- You're so disgusting.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.138
Rosemary, wait. Don't. Don't go.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.688
What did I tell you two?

05:20.904 --> 05:22.270
Eh?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.795
- Good morning.
- Morning.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.718
You slept on the couch again.
Is your bed not comfortable?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.796
My bed was shaking.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.222
Shaking?

05:50.433 --> 05:51.765
Maybe we had
another tremor.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.306
I have an idea.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.858
Why don't you come to church
with me today.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.355
Um...

06:02.571 --> 06:03.857
I have so much
I need to get done

06:04.072 --> 06:05.654
before school tomorrow.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.858
Okay, well, I'm going to try
again next week.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.281
I'll see you
when I get home.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.657
Please eat something, okay?

08:54.409 --> 08:56.071
Hello?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.080
Aunt Tanya,
are you here?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.251
Hello?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.504
The Lord says,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.510
if your sins be a scarlet,

09:18.725 --> 09:20.967
let them be made
white as snow.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.848
And if they be red as crimson,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.850
they shall be made
white as wool.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.681
So it is important
to both forgive

09:26.900 --> 09:28.482
and allow forgiveness

09:28.693 --> 09:30.776
in order to receive
God's true blessings.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.070
So remember that next time
someone swoops in

09:33.281 --> 09:34.817
and steals your front-row
parking spot

09:35.033 --> 09:36.945
at the grocery store.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.026
Just like Mrs. Johnson
forgave me last night

09:39.245 --> 09:41.988
when I accidentally swooped in
and stole her spot.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.494
My bad, Mrs. Johnson.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.496
And speaking of blessings,

09:46.711 --> 09:49.624
I'm truly blessed to be welcomed
into this church community

09:49.839 --> 09:51.751
with such loving
and open arms.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.320
You've really made
this transition

09:54.344 --> 09:56.586
this past two months
an easy one.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.922
And I'm especially blessed

09:59.140 --> 10:01.723
to receive the spiritual
guidance

10:01.935 --> 10:03.642
and leadership
of Reverend Michael.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.986
Seems like we had
a good turnout today.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.438
Yes, we did.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.525
I thought you did very well.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.638
I just need to
put together some readings

10:20.662 --> 10:22.779
for the next youth meeting.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.035
I see you found a title
for my personal collection.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.871
Oh. Um...

10:29.087 --> 10:30.328
yes, sorry.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.334
It just caught my eye.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.791
Well, that's okay.
Could you put it back, please?

10:35.009 --> 10:36.341
Absolutely.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.137
I didn't know that you were
into demonology and exorcism.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.306
I was.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.718
Well, I find it fascinating...

10:44.894 --> 10:47.261
Some books are best left
on the shelf.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.891
Of course.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.441
All right, well, I'm off.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.026
See you later.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.656
Good sermon.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.257
Ashley.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.718
Ashley?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.260
Hello?

14:16.564 --> 14:18.351
Hey.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.353
You don't remember me,
do you?

14:20.568 --> 14:21.979
It's Hannah.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.188
Hey.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.967
It's amazing.
You look exactly the same,

14:28.034 --> 14:30.617
except older and taller.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.069
Do I look the same?

14:32.288 --> 14:33.495
You're taller.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.828
Where did you guys
end up going?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.784
You kind of just disappeared.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.245
It's messed up how we didn't
even get to say goodbye.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.672
Yeah, we went up north.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.588
That's a cute necklace.
Where did you get it?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.046
- It's so vintage.
- Thanks. It was my mom's.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.800
It's cool.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.850
How's your sister?
Where's she at nowadays?

14:55.061 --> 14:57.394
She's good, she got
a scholarship to Penn State.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.647
What brought you guys back?

15:00.858 --> 15:03.601
Jesus, once I escape,
I am never coming back.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.063
Do you remember the last time
you were here?

15:07.281 --> 15:08.647
It was a long time ago.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.570
Nothing much has changed, so...

15:14.789 --> 15:16.826
- Yeah.
- Won't be different.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.535
So, what do you do around here?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.245
Gosh.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.171
Um, we go to the lake.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.794
We...

15:27.009 --> 15:28.170
you know.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.843
Yeah.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.716
Go to the movies. That's fun.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.719
There's a couple cute boys
at school.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.641
This is it.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.431
Your room's a little crazy,
friend.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.687
What is all this stuff?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.393
Oh, this is my gear.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.148
The Mormons might
be kind of weird,

15:48.364 --> 15:50.356
but they're onto something.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.612
Onto what?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.659
Angels and demons
walking the earth.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.328
I know, it sounds crazy,

15:56.539 --> 15:57.996
but I've been reading
a lot about it,

15:58.207 --> 16:00.039
and it all sounds so epic.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.868
Just want to make sure I'm ready
in case anything ever happens.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.000
- Serious? Angels and demons?
- Yes, seriously.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.002
Demons are serious stuff.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.675
Haven't you ever seen
"The Exorcist"?

16:10.887 --> 16:13.504
Once Regan used that Ouija board
to invite Captain Howdy in,

16:13.723 --> 16:14.930
she was fucked.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.258
I've never seen it.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.389
You never seen "The Exorcist"?

16:19.604 --> 16:21.846
We have to watch it one night.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.230
Do you remember Shane Stevens?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.062
He was the nerdy kid
with the turtle.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.241
He'd follow us around the gym.
Had a crush on you.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.024
Kinda.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.610
He's hot and single, and we're
hanging out tonight.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.286
Do you want to come?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.239
I don't know, Hannah.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.666
You're invited.
You're coming.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.963
Oh, there you are.
I thought you were upstairs.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.012
Hi, I'm Hannah.
You must be Aunt Tanya.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.431
Yeah. Miss Winbourne,
or Aunt Tanya.

17:39.642 --> 17:40.849
"Tanya" is good.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.972
Cool.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.082
What are you guys up to? I was just going to
make dinner. Do you wanna stay for dinner?

17:45.106 --> 17:47.348
Oh, no. Hannah are I were going
to go to the dock

17:47.567 --> 17:49.007
and hang out
with a bunch of friends.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.601
Oh, you were going to go?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.436
Do you mind if we go?

17:52.655 --> 17:54.692
Just don't be late.
You have school tomorrow.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.523
Yeah, we won't.
We won't be.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.951
Okay. Do you know what happened
with that picture?

18:00.162 --> 18:01.994
Yeah, I found a school picture
of Mom,

18:02.206 --> 18:03.822
and I thought
I'd put it up there.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.077
Is that all right?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.659
Yeah, it's fine.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.243
Whatever you need
to feel at home.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.044
I'm gonna run upstairs
and get changed.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.838
- Okay.
- It was nice to meet you,

18:12.049 --> 18:16.885
Aunt Tanya, or Tanya,
or Miss Winbourne.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.358
Ooh!

18:33.154 --> 18:34.440
Ooh, you're so creepy.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.584
- Carrie!
- Hannah's here.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.627
What is up?

18:51.839 --> 18:54.877
- The life of the party is here.
- Finally. Took you long enough.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.378
How are you?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.301
Great. Good to see you.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.469
I thought I'd spend
more time with my girl.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.422
Your girl?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.634
You know what I'm saying.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.397
So, everyone, this is our
long-lost friend, Ashley,

19:10.608 --> 19:12.691
You may know her as
the little girl from art class.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.815
But as you can see, she's fully
grown to start some trouble.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.773
- Whoo!
- So, friends, Ashley.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.791
- Ashley, friends.
- Nice to meet you, Ashley.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.783
Hey, I'm Bryce.
Call me Big Bryce. Big Bryce.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.487
Hey.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.242
How are you?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.788
Get you something to drink.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.243
- It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.413
It's been a while.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.918
Yeah.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.750
Well, make yourself
at home and...

19:38.969 --> 19:40.210
let's party.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.722
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.595
Oh, yeah, I don't drink either.
It's cool.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.722
- All right.
- Let's go.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.098
Do you remember me?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.026
Yeah.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.815
You used to follow us
around gym.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.030
Oh, man.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.822
How's your pet turtle?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.033
Myrtle?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.619
She wasn't long for this world,
I guess.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.196
She, uh...

20:07.415 --> 20:08.496
she's in a better place.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.666
It's good to have you back.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.292
Thanks.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.466
Hey, I know something fun.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.518
Do you guys have that new
EVP app?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.266
What, the stupid
"Ghost Hunters" shit?

20:32.481 --> 20:34.894
- You're such a dork.
- Yeah, a cute dork.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.145
What's EVP?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.817
Oh, my God. Check it out.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.611
EVP is "electronic
voice phenomenon."

20:40.823 --> 20:43.065
It's the app they use in all
those ghost-hunting shows.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.742
- It totally works.
- I got it on my phone here.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.615
Of course you do.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.038
Dude, he's so whipped.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.457
Everyone, listen, the phone's
going to pick up anything

20:52.668 --> 20:55.581
Voices,
paranormal activity, anything.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.037
Listen.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.341
Are there any spirits out there
that want to talk to us?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.758
I don't know, Hannah.
This is kind of weird.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.430
Come on,
don't worry about it.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.121
I'm sure this stuff
doesn't even work.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.266
You guys hear that?

21:10.478 --> 21:12.344
Oh, my God.

21:12.563 --> 21:15.180
I think it's saying for the
girls to show us their boobs.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.140
I'm sure that's what you heard,
perv.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.272
No, but really, listen.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.400
Ashley.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.493
Ashley.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.551
What the hell
is wrong with this girl?

21:48.766 --> 21:50.723
Are you okay? What's wrong?

21:50.935 --> 21:54.303
I don't know.
I think I saw my mom.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.263
You're such a dick, Bryce.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.322
- Ashley, wait up.
- Dude, what's your problem?

21:58.526 --> 22:00.984
She's screaming, we're trying
to have a good, quiet evening.

22:01.195 --> 22:03.107
I'm leaving.
Are you coming?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.405
I drove you here,
so you better come.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.209
Ashley.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.801
Aunt Tanya.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.693
Ashley, you okay?

24:14.912 --> 24:16.619
Yeah, I'm fine,
Aunt Tanya.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.991
I'm taking a bath.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.573
Okay.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.652
Come in.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.486
Hey. How was your thing
with your friends?

24:57.705 --> 24:59.037
It was okay.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.998
You look so much
like your mom.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.753
That's her necklace,
isn't it?

25:06.964 --> 25:08.796
Yeah.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.716
I've worn it since
I was a little kid.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.214
It's like a little
piece of her.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.133
You know, I bought that for her
on her 16th birthday.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.604
I hope you know how happy I am
to have you here, Ashley.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.899
I do.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.022
I just wish
Jordan was here.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.444
I know.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.280
It's going to be okay.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.232
You know that, right?

25:38.454 --> 25:39.911
How do you know?

25:40.122 --> 25:42.034
Because I know.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.458
And I know that God never gives
us more than we can handle.

25:47.212 --> 25:51.001
I just feel like
he's given me a lot,

25:51.216 --> 25:53.924
and I'm really trying
to handle it all.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.968
I know you are.

25:57.181 --> 25:59.138
But you are so strong.

25:59.349 --> 26:02.092
You're going
to get through this.

26:02.311 --> 26:05.804
And if there's anything I can do
to make you feel more at home,

26:06.023 --> 26:07.605
please let me know.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.773
Thank you.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.207
Ready for your first
day of school tomorrow?

26:15.240 --> 26:16.697
Ready or not,
here it comes.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.295
All right, you get some sleep,
sweetie, okay?

26:20.370 --> 26:21.611
I'll see you in the morning.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.787
- Good night.
- Good night.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.510
You boys don't be late to school,
now, or we'll all be in trouble.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.057
Okay?

28:48.268 --> 28:49.600
Thanks, Sam.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.698
Good morning.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.445
Hi, good morning.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.159
Pastor John,
what's the word?

29:14.378 --> 29:16.995
Oh, hey, Sam. Same as always.
God's word.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.302
Ashley?

29:27.557 --> 29:28.638
Yeah?

29:28.850 --> 29:30.182
Hi. I'm...

29:30.394 --> 29:31.680
I'm John.

29:31.895 --> 29:35.229
I'm the new pastor
at Celebration.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.228
I work a lot
with the youth ministry,

29:38.443 --> 29:40.685
and your Aunt Tanya
told me a lot about you.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.395
Okay.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.108
Well, how are you doing?

29:46.326 --> 29:47.942
I mean, are you happy
to be back?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.704
Yeah. It's all right.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.123
Well, what's left of it.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.916
Yeah.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.290
I know the feeling.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.755
Well, I like this part of town.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.607
I feel like it's got
a lot of personality.

30:04.761 --> 30:08.220
I kind of feel like
it's the last link to the past.

30:11.727 --> 30:14.845
You know, we got a lot of really
great events planned at church.

30:15.063 --> 30:18.056
It'd be really nice
to see you there sometime.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.351
Yeah, it'd be cool.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.529
Is that the 7D?

30:25.741 --> 30:27.653
Yeah, it sure is.

30:27.868 --> 30:30.201
That's right, Tanya told me
that you're into photography.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.869
Yeah, I love it.
I have the Mark V,

30:32.080 --> 30:34.322
but I heard the VII
takes better pictures.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.032
Yeah, the picture quality
is great.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.369
It just... sometimes
the exposure's off.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.454
Maybe you could
take a look at it?

30:41.673 --> 30:43.505
Yeah.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.877
You know, I'm always looking
for talented photographers

30:46.011 --> 30:47.673
to take pictures
at church events.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.130
I'd love to. Can I get back
to you about that?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.466
- Okay, great.
- Pastor John. Hey.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.596
Hey. I'll see you Sunday.
All right.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.724
Hannah, haven't seen you
at church in a while.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.308
I see you smiling.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.892
What, you think he's hot?

31:04.237 --> 31:05.773
No, but he's pretty cool.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.571
Yeah, okay, you know
for a pastor.

31:07.783 --> 31:08.990
Whatever.

31:10.619 --> 31:11.985
Hey, are you okay?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.661
Freaked out yesterday.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.455
Yeah, it was nothing.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.998
It was something.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.576
Did you see something?

31:19.795 --> 31:21.661
What were you saying
about your mom?

31:23.423 --> 31:26.006
I don't know.
My mind's playing tricks on me.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.925
Are you sure?
Because it just seemed...

31:28.136 --> 31:29.843
Hannah, it was nothing.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.763
Whatever you say, Ash.
But it was definitely something.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.220
You girls playing
the next EVP session?

31:36.436 --> 31:38.076
- I want in.
- Come on, man, knock it off.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.762
You guys want a ride to school?

31:39.981 --> 31:42.098
Really? This is our workout
for the day.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.855
And besides, the school's
right up the street, dumbasses.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.547
All right, fine,
but you're missing out

31:46.571 --> 31:48.107
on the pleasure of our company.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.773
See you later, ladies.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.485
See you at school, sweetie!

31:59.793 --> 32:00.793
Wait, hold on.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.423
Hannah, what is this?

32:07.843 --> 32:09.300
It's Shane.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.047
I gave him your number.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.720
Wait, Hannah...

32:13.932 --> 32:16.219
What are you doing?

32:16.435 --> 32:17.892
I don't know.
What do you think?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.622
You take a look.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.478
One second, excuse me.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.272
Hello?

32:23.483 --> 32:24.894
Speaking.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.165
- Hey.
- Hey, have you seen Ashley?

32:41.376 --> 32:43.618
I've been texting her all day
and she's not responding.

32:43.837 --> 32:45.328
I was actually about to ask you.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.066
I was going to see
if she needed a ride.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.170
Did you hear what happened?

32:48.341 --> 32:49.627
Yeah, is she okay?

32:49.843 --> 32:51.835
There she is.

32:52.053 --> 32:55.672
Hey, Ashley,
what happened to you?

32:55.891 --> 32:57.382
- Nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.433
You almost gave Mr. Diggler
a heart attack.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.727
I just want to go home.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.554
All right,
just stay here.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.935
I'll go get my truck
and I can take you home, okay?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.776
Did you see
your mom again?

33:08.987 --> 33:11.525
Um... I don't know.

33:11.740 --> 33:12.776
Holy shit, you did.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.653
Hannah, please stop, okay?

33:14.868 --> 33:16.825
No, Ashley, there's something
going on with you.

33:17.037 --> 33:18.573
I'm coming over tonight.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.495
I just... I need sleep,
that's it.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.118
I'll see you tonight.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.676
Not the best
first day of school, huh?

33:39.684 --> 33:42.051
I just want to say that
I'm sorry about this morning.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.761
We were just messing
with you guys.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.708
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

34:01.748 --> 34:06.118
Hey, Ash, I'm just calling
to check on you.

34:06.336 --> 34:08.668
I just got off the phone
with your principal.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.088
So call me when you can, okay?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.400
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah, no problem.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.025
So I guess I'll see you
tomorrow?

34:38.201 --> 34:39.658
Yeah.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.485
Could I give you
another ride tomorrow?

34:43.540 --> 34:45.076
Sure.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.384
Hey.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.555
No, no. I'm just glad
you're okay.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.971
Okay, we'll talk
when I get home, okay?

35:46.186 --> 35:47.893
All right,
I'll be home soon.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.640
Okay.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.868
Hello?

36:39.781 --> 36:41.067
Hello?

36:46.496 --> 36:48.203
This isn't funny.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.049
Hey!

38:24.260 --> 38:27.719
Hannah, you can't...
shit, scare me like that.

38:27.931 --> 38:30.264
- Sorry. I'll knock next time.
- Oh, my gosh.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.309
You were just, like,
knocking all over the house.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.307
What are you talking about?

38:35.522 --> 38:38.435
Very funny.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.733
It wasn't me, but okay.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.981
What's that smell?

38:44.197 --> 38:45.904
I don't know.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.075
Something must have died
in the vent or something.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.327
Hey, is that a Bible?
We're going to need it.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.879
So, what are we doing?

39:03.091 --> 39:04.923
This is my first time
trying this.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.547
Do you remember that EVP thing
that I showed you last night?

39:07.762 --> 39:09.424
Well, this is way better
for communicating

39:09.639 --> 39:11.301
with one specific
dead person.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.475
- It's totally old-school.
- I don't know, Hannah.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.394
Trust me. We have to figure
out if this is actually your mom

39:17.605 --> 39:19.016
trying to reach out to you.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.349
- What if it's...
- What if what?

39:21.568 --> 39:23.560
What if it works?

39:25.905 --> 39:29.194
What's your mom's first name?
It's super important.

39:30.243 --> 39:31.950
Sarah.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.904
Okay. If Sarah reveals
herself to you,

39:35.123 --> 39:37.581
you have to acknowledge her
and ask her to come back to you.

39:37.792 --> 39:40.125
That way, we can figure out
what's keeping her here.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.419
Okay.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.088
Okay. Let's begin.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.673
Hello, Sarah.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.005
I'm Hannah, and I'm here
with your daughter, Ashley.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.215
She'd like to speak with you.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.472
Will you communicate
with us?

40:02.483 --> 40:05.726
Sarah, if you're here,
give us a sign.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.402
Hannah, what's with
this mirror?

40:07.614 --> 40:09.401
Should we close our eyes
or something?

40:09.616 --> 40:12.108
No, I think the mirrors acts as
a conduit to the spirit world.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.035
We have to look directly into it
in order to see your mom.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.998
Sarah, please speak now.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.250
Sarah, please come forward
and speak with your daughter.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.465
What the hell?
Did you hear that?

40:29.677 --> 40:32.340
- Yeah. What was that?
- I don't know.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.091
Sarah, show us
that you're here.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.763
What the hell? I saw something.
What did you see?

40:38.978 --> 40:40.264
I don't... I don't know.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.597
Call her, Ashley.
She's here.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.351
- Mom.
- Ask her again.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.229
Mom, are you here?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.484
Please, Mom, I'm begging you,
I want you in my life.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.526
Will you please come back to me?
I love you. Please!

40:55.286 --> 40:56.527
What did you do?

40:56.746 --> 40:58.954
I did what you told me to do.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.616
This doesn't feel right.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.497
What do you mean?

41:15.974 --> 41:18.387
Hey, it's freezing in here.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.639
What are you guys doing?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.186
What is that smell?

41:23.398 --> 41:24.855
I should probably
get going.

41:25.066 --> 41:27.433
- Bye, Miss Winbourne.
- Hannah, wait.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.859
Hannah, wait.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.282
We're messed up.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.362
That shadow was dark.
I'm not sure it was your mom.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.572
- I just...
- What do you mean?

41:41.791 --> 41:43.077
I don't know.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.249
I'll see you.

41:55.138 --> 41:56.754
Well, she left in a hurry.

41:56.973 --> 41:59.636
- What's going on?
- Nothing. It was nothing.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.264
Next you'll tell me what
happened in school is nothing?

42:02.478 --> 42:04.310
I don't want to talk about it.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.356
- Okay, Ashley...
- I don't want to talk about it!

42:13.948 --> 42:16.190
Listen, Ashley, you may not
want to talk to me

42:16.409 --> 42:17.900
about every single thing
you're doing,

42:18.119 --> 42:20.452
but you will not
disrespect me.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.497
I'm sorry, Aunt Tanya.

42:23.708 --> 42:26.997
I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.254
Look, this isn't easy
for me either.

42:34.135 --> 42:37.253
I'm sorry, okay?
Today was really hard.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.547
Is there anything
I can do to help?

42:41.934 --> 42:43.550
I don't think so.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.602
How about we have
a movie night?

42:45.813 --> 42:49.181
We can watch something light,
we can pig out on popcorn.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.518
It was your mom and my favorite
thing to do.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.729
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.922
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

43:18.221 --> 43:21.805
So, tell me more about
you and mom's movie nights.

43:22.016 --> 43:24.679
Oh, they were our favorite
things to do.

43:26.646 --> 43:29.184
Mostly, it was just an excuse
to stay up late

43:29.398 --> 43:32.482
and talk about boys
and school.

43:32.693 --> 43:33.729
And boys.

43:35.363 --> 43:37.150
We talked about
everything.

43:37.365 --> 43:41.780
Did she ever talk
about wanting to be a mom?

43:41.994 --> 43:43.986
Or having kids?

44:04.058 --> 44:07.301
I've preparest
a table before me

44:07.520 --> 44:09.637
in the presence
of mine enemies.

44:09.856 --> 44:12.098
Thou anoints...

44:12.316 --> 44:15.559
I... I have failed.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.021
I have failed you.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.697
I have failed thee.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.819
I need to tell you something.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.370
Okay.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.790
I'm pregnant.

44:32.211 --> 44:33.873
Tanya, listen.

44:35.882 --> 44:37.999
There's something
going on with me.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.594
I'm hearing these voices
in my head.

44:42.805 --> 44:45.297
And it's... it's making me
do things.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.473
Really bad things.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.802
And I can't control it.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.810
I don't know what you mean,
that you can't control it.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.017
- I need your help.
- I don't...

44:56.235 --> 44:57.567
Tanya...

44:58.821 --> 44:59.821
You need to see someone.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.563
You need medical help.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.444
- Sarah...
- I'm scared.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.279
Please, Tanya,
just pray with me, okay?

45:08.497 --> 45:10.033
Okay, okay, okay.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.707
Dear heavenly Father,

45:12.919 --> 45:14.455
please watch over Sarah.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.457
Please cast out
her afflictions

45:16.672 --> 45:20.086
and heal her mind
and her thoughts and action.

45:20.301 --> 45:22.793
Please watch over my sister.

45:27.141 --> 45:28.632
What is it?

45:29.936 --> 45:31.518
What are you saying, Sarah.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.846
- You don't believe me.
- I do.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.057
I don't know what to do.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.062
You don't believe me.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.064
Aunt Tanya?

45:40.279 --> 45:41.645
Ashley.

45:41.864 --> 45:43.446
Oh, God, I'm...

45:43.658 --> 45:46.196
- Are you okay?
- I must have had a nightmare.

45:46.410 --> 45:49.494
I'm sorry I fell
asleep on you.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.287
No, it's okay.

45:51.499 --> 45:53.081
Um...

45:53.292 --> 45:55.409
You know, I'm going
to go to bed.

45:55.628 --> 45:57.665
I don't think you'll like
the movie anyways.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.496
It doesn't have
a happy ending.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.547
No, you know what?
I'm...

46:01.759 --> 46:04.342
I'm going to head to bed too.
It's way past my bedtime.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.385
You sleep good, angel.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.838
Thanks.

47:35.978 --> 47:38.095
I see you got
your appetite back.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.727
How'd you sleep?

47:49.533 --> 47:51.195
Ashley, what happened
to your shoulder?

47:51.410 --> 47:53.370
Oh, I just bumped into some
branches in the woods.

47:53.496 --> 47:55.579
It doesn't look like
you just bumped into branches.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.452
- Let me see.
- I got to go, I'm late.

47:57.666 --> 47:58.952
Bye.

48:19.772 --> 48:21.388
Hey.

48:21.607 --> 48:22.893
Hi.

48:23.109 --> 48:24.520
Ready to go?

48:24.735 --> 48:26.317
Yeah.

48:26.529 --> 48:29.522
I was thinking after
what happened yesterday,

48:29.740 --> 48:31.606
we could use a little
adventure.

48:31.826 --> 48:33.192
What do you say?

48:35.121 --> 48:36.453
I say, get in.

48:36.664 --> 48:37.871
All right.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.081
Wait, where are you going?

48:44.296 --> 48:46.083
Hop in.

49:38.225 --> 49:40.467
They say that if you close
your eyes,

49:40.686 --> 49:43.770
you can feel that my hands
are going to move a lot faster.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.517
You want me
to close my eyes?

49:45.733 --> 49:48.271
Yeah, close your eyes.
Trust me.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.644
You ready?

49:52.448 --> 49:54.110
Oh, come on.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.362
- I'm going easy on you.
- Oh, really?

49:56.577 --> 49:58.068
- Yeah.
- Close your eyes.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.492
All right.

50:05.377 --> 50:06.834
- Last one.
- Okay.

50:07.046 --> 50:08.753
- Actually try this time.
- All right.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.211
Ow.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.009
Jeez.

50:15.221 --> 50:17.258
So, what's it like
being back?

50:17.473 --> 50:20.056
I don't know.
Do you like my outfit?

50:20.267 --> 50:22.725
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

50:22.937 --> 50:25.054
Then come closer.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.431
Okay.

50:33.781 --> 50:35.613
Do I scare you?

50:36.909 --> 50:38.241
- Do you scare me?
- Yeah.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.284
No, you don't scare me.

50:41.497 --> 50:42.829
Then kiss me.

50:53.551 --> 50:55.133
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
come on.

50:55.344 --> 50:57.256
Slow down a bit.
We don't have to go that fast.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.087
Oh, come on,
isn't this what you want?

50:59.306 --> 51:00.592
I guess.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.392
Hold on. Ashley,
I just want to see something.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.186
Stop for a second.

51:11.443 --> 51:12.684
What the fu...

51:12.903 --> 51:14.439
You bit my tongue.

51:14.655 --> 51:16.772
Oh, come on, Shane.

51:22.496 --> 51:24.032
What the heck
is wrong with you?

51:27.376 --> 51:29.993
Sorry, excuse me a second.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.792
Hello?

51:34.008 --> 51:35.499
I'm sorry, what?

51:37.177 --> 51:39.715
No, she left this morning
for school.

51:41.348 --> 51:43.135
Are you sure?

51:43.350 --> 51:45.637
Okay, thank you.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.737
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

51:53.861 --> 51:56.353
Where are you?
Call me now.

51:56.572 --> 51:59.235
- Is everything okay?
- No. I got to go.

52:11.045 --> 52:13.253
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.922
Hey, Ash,
where were you today?

52:16.133 --> 52:17.465
Call me.

52:21.263 --> 52:22.754
Ashley?

52:25.934 --> 52:27.345
Ashley?

52:34.902 --> 52:37.110
Ashley?

52:44.912 --> 52:45.993
Ashley?

53:01.053 --> 53:02.715
"Inviting spirits into our world

53:02.930 --> 53:05.047
"can lead to the unintended
and lethal consequence

53:05.265 --> 53:06.676
of demonic possession."

53:17.986 --> 53:19.906
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

53:19.947 --> 53:22.564
Ashley, can you call me?

53:22.783 --> 53:24.945
I have to tell you something.

53:31.542 --> 53:32.908
Ashley?

53:35.879 --> 53:37.836
Ashley, we need to talk.

53:41.969 --> 53:43.756
Ashley, I am talking to you.

53:45.431 --> 53:47.923
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. What happened?

53:48.142 --> 53:51.226
Okay, put your head back.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

53:51.437 --> 53:53.394
It's all right.

54:07.911 --> 54:10.073
What are you doing here
so late?

54:10.289 --> 54:11.700
Oh.

54:11.915 --> 54:13.622
I just wanted to come
and make sure

54:13.834 --> 54:16.042
everything was good
for tomorrow's small group.

54:16.253 --> 54:17.494
What about you?

54:17.713 --> 54:18.898
What are you doing here
so late?

54:20.299 --> 54:21.881
Pray.

54:24.386 --> 54:26.002
Hmm.

54:26.221 --> 54:27.981
Come on, Reverend.
I'll give you a ride home.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.223
I can come in early tomorrow.
We can talk in the car.

54:30.434 --> 54:33.222
Well, thank you
for your generosity,

54:33.437 --> 54:37.898
but I don't need a therapist
or a chauffeur at the moment.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.849
What do you need?

54:40.068 --> 54:41.354
Uh...

54:41.570 --> 54:42.811
forgiveness.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.111
Don't we all?

54:54.291 --> 54:56.408
Well, you came
to the right place.

54:58.045 --> 55:00.378
What's on your heart?

55:03.133 --> 55:05.170
You ever doubt, John?

55:06.428 --> 55:08.010
Of course.

55:08.222 --> 55:10.214
Doubt is part of humanity.

55:10.432 --> 55:12.594
I doubt and I question,

55:12.810 --> 55:15.223
but in the end my faith
is strengthened in... what?

55:15.437 --> 55:17.770
Spare me the seminary
bullshit.

55:17.981 --> 55:19.893
I mean, really doubt.

55:21.485 --> 55:25.445
Not just in him,
but in yourself.

55:27.115 --> 55:29.323
Your goodness.

55:31.119 --> 55:34.829
Your ability to fight
for goodness in others.

55:36.416 --> 55:37.748
Hmm.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.958
I believe there's a name
for that.

55:43.173 --> 55:44.853
- A wavering assurance.
- Oh, that's right.

55:45.008 --> 55:47.216
We're always quick
with the names, aren't we?

55:47.427 --> 55:49.714
To name is to destroy.

55:52.224 --> 55:54.967
There was a time when I was
pretty good at that:

55:55.185 --> 55:56.551
naming.

55:58.146 --> 56:00.763
Goodness and God, love.

56:02.860 --> 56:04.943
Wish I could name it now.

56:05.946 --> 56:07.528
Hmm.

56:08.866 --> 56:10.778
I'm afraid I don't follow.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.615
Well, you won't, Reverend.

56:14.830 --> 56:17.698
To destroy your
wavering assurance?

56:17.916 --> 56:20.249
To find peace
in your own goodness?

56:20.460 --> 56:22.122
What do I want?

56:22.337 --> 56:23.873
What do I want more
than anything?

56:24.089 --> 56:27.708
More than finding peace
in my own goodness?

56:29.261 --> 56:32.220
I want to destroy
the darkness.

56:33.932 --> 56:36.640
I want to make it right
for all those souls

56:36.852 --> 56:38.764
that I have failed.

56:43.066 --> 56:45.103
Then that is what
I will help you do.

56:47.029 --> 56:49.271
And into the presence
of the Lord, there is no doubt.

56:49.489 --> 56:51.105
Yes.

56:51.325 --> 56:54.033
In the presence of the Lord,
there is no doubt.

56:56.496 --> 56:58.328
That was more blood

56:58.540 --> 57:01.783
than I have seen come out of
anybody nose in my whole life.

57:02.002 --> 57:03.994
Two pints.

57:04.212 --> 57:05.453
Tanya.

57:08.175 --> 57:09.461
- How is she?
- She's fine.

57:09.676 --> 57:11.292
It's just a nosebleed.

57:11.511 --> 57:13.377
Just a nosebleed?
There was blood everywhere.

57:13.597 --> 57:15.677
Look, nosebleeds often look
much worse than they are.

57:15.724 --> 57:18.137
It's the stress of the
environment could be the cause.

57:18.352 --> 57:20.560
Change affects each of us
very differently.

57:20.771 --> 57:23.184
No, I'm... I'm really
worried about her.

57:23.398 --> 57:24.889
You don't need
to worry, Tanya.

57:25.108 --> 57:26.748
No, you weren't there.
You didn't see her.

57:26.902 --> 57:28.188
Paging Dr. Carraz.

57:28.403 --> 57:29.564
I got to run.
But, you know,

57:29.780 --> 57:31.740
I left her in the care
of an on-call psychiatrist,

57:31.907 --> 57:33.489
Dr. Liles.
You can go see her.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.191
She's in good hands.

57:35.410 --> 57:36.804
It'll do her good
to talk to someone.

57:36.828 --> 57:38.035
Okay?

57:40.332 --> 57:42.198
Hi, Tanya, I'm Dr. Liles.

57:42.417 --> 57:43.953
Thanks for coming in.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.660
There are just a few things

57:45.879 --> 57:48.041
I needed to go over
with both of you.

57:48.256 --> 57:51.465
I'm going to prescribe
an anti-depressant

57:51.677 --> 57:54.465
I want you to take
for a few weeks.

57:54.680 --> 57:58.640
It'll help make the transitional
period a little easier.

57:58.850 --> 58:02.560
I'm also going to prescribe
a sedative

58:02.771 --> 58:04.512
to help you sleep.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.768
Do you really think
she needs all that?

58:06.984 --> 58:08.816
I do.

58:09.027 --> 58:12.520
Her mind and body need sleep
in order to heal themselves.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.275
And the medicine
will make her calm

58:14.491 --> 58:15.823
and enable that to happen.

58:16.034 --> 58:17.821
Okay?

58:18.036 --> 58:20.494
But if you have any questions,
please feel free to call me.

58:20.706 --> 58:22.698
I will. Thank you.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.829
You're okay, kiddo.

58:26.044 --> 58:29.162
But if you need anyone
to talk to,

58:29.381 --> 58:31.213
call me anytime.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:21.775
screams]

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.264
Tanya.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.064
Tanya...

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.177
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.760
Thank you for being here on
this beautiful Sunday morning.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.470
Please be seated.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:40.056
Now, this is the will of him
who sent me,

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:42.016
the Father,

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:45.399
that I should lose nothing
of what he has given me,

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:48.777
but that I should raise it up
on the last day,

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:52.576
for this is the will
of my father who sent me.

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:56.781
That whoever holds the son
and believes in him

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.832
shall have everlasting life.

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:01.832
And I will raise him up
on the last day.

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:06.044
They said therefore to him,

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:09.002
"Lord, give us always
this bread."

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.587
But Jesus said to them,

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:12.922
"I am the bread of life."

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:16.289
"He who comes to me
shall not hunger."

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.889
"He who believes in me
shall never thirst.

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:25.355
"But I have told you
that I have seen thee,

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.027
and you do not believe."

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:41.451
I thirst Apostles' Creed.

01:04:41.669 --> 01:04:43.911
I'll feast on her soul.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:00.765
Look, I got to run
to the hospital.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.017
I'm going to come check on you
as soon as possible.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.475
I beg you, leave her with me.
I can help her.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:08.231
I am not leaving her side.
The only reason I brought her

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:10.153
was because I didn't know
what else to do.

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.027
Her soul is in jeopardy.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.700
She needs to be on holy ground
for her own survival.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.493
It's happening again,

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:19.196
what happened with Sarah.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.874
Don't you dare
say her name.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.701
What did you do to her?

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.377
I knew something
was wrong with her,

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.954
and I left anyway.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.539
Well, that is not
happening again.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:32.964
Tanya...

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.930
I'll figure it out
on my own.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.721
Come to my office, now.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.567
So, what's going on
with Ashley?

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.646
I need to know exactly
what we're up against.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:59.279
I've seen more evil
than any one man should.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:03.411
And demonic possession
is real.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.243
I've had too many people

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:08.671
that I have loved and led
consumed by evil,

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.375
and I have fought
tooth and nail,

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.301
and I have lost.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:17.471
I have lost more than you can
begin to imagine.

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:21.847
It is shaken my faith and
my belief in myself to the core.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:26.684
I don't know what to say.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.141
I want to help any way I can.

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.525
The greatest weapon we have
against the demon

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.652
lies within his name.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:37.699
Well, the demon is commanded
to give his name

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.073
in the name of Jesus Christ,
shouldn't it?

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:42.371
Not always. I believe this one
has been invited in,

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:44.198
like Ashley's mother's case.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.454
He won't give up his name
so easily.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.456
Ashley's mother?

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.503
Yes.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:52.547
Well, then we have
to figure out a way.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:55.923
We have to help
any way that we can.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.380
Yes. Grab as many books
as you can on possession

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.386
and name demonic entities.

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.012
I'm going to give you
a crash course

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:06.471
in performing an exorcism.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.397
We have to go to Tanya's
and fight for Ashley.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:12.568
We can't have evil win.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:14.395
Not again.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:19.070
Possession has three
demonic stages.

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.698
The first is infestation.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:25.281
A demon will be active
in a place, or space.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.584
Some of these signs
may be objects moving,

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:33.335
unrecognizable whispering
and putrid smells.

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:35.920
The second is oppression.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.501
This is when the demon
is focused

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.589
on one specific person
or individual.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:45.518
The demon will take the form
of a loved one to earn trust.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.685
The final stage
is possession.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:50.014
This is when the person
invites a demon in,

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.397
allowing the demon
to take complete control.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.944
The only way to defeat
the demon

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:57.771
is to unlock
the secret of his name

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.948
and use it against him.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.708
How is she?

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.334
She's not good.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.042
- Where is she?
- She's upstairs, resting.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.969
There was an accident
involving Hannah.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.718
Is she okay?

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:32.394
I'm going to go
see Ashley.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.145
Tanya.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:19.604
This is more than you can handle
on your own.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:21.438
It's beyond your control.

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.196
It's gotten worse,
hasn't it?

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.451
I don't know what to do.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.033
Tell me what to do.

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.270
Oh, dear Lord.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.436
Redo that restraint.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:08.782
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:10.612
hallowed be thy name.

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:12.552
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on Earth,

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.826
as it is in heaven.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.707
And what of my will?

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.292
Lord, Jesus Christ,
is upon you.

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.764
Lord, protect Ashley.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.682
And keep her safe.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.603
Ashley's not here.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:37.768
Is this your handiwork?

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:40.271
Ah, ah, ah, Michael.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.941
Who are you?

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:45.443
Who are you?

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:47.365
Who the fuck are you?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.193
Dear Lord...

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.745
I'm John Douglas,
the pastor of Celebration.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:54.243
"I'm John Douglas,
pastor of Celebration."

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:56.542
Cocksucker!

01:10:56.753 --> 01:11:00.087
Dear Lord, cast away any evil

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:03.336
that harms this child, Ashley,
or Tanya.

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:05.884
Her soul is mine.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.009
Oh, my God!

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.762
"Oh, my God!"

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:18.059
Why hast thou forsaken me?

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.061
You don't believe me.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:24.645
Help me, Tanya!

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:28.153
Get her out of here.
Get her out of here!

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:32.694
We need to be
alone with the demon.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:40.202
The only chance we have
of learning the demon's name

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:44.756
is to get her back to holy
ground after she's sedated.

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:50.879
I need you to hold her

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.260
while I inject her.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.672
We will prevail
with the power of the Lord.

01:12:29.887 --> 01:12:31.879
And if we do not?

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:36.559
We will vanquish
wavering assurances

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:39.557
in the presence of the Lord,
there is no doubt.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:05.500
Demon, in the name
of Jesus Christ,

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:08.128
I rebuke you
and cast you away.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.083
Fuck...

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.013
you.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.260
Ah!

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:19.138
Don't throw my piss on me.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.515
God, the Father Almighty,

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:26.378
maker of heaven and earth,
and to Jesus Christ,

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.813
his only son, our Lord,

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:29.565
who was conceived
of the Holy Ghost,

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.112
born of the Virgin Mary,

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:33.236
suffered unto Pontius Pilate,

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.033
was crucified,
dead and buried.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.826
He descended into hell.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.495
The third day,
he arose from the dead

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:40.038
and ascended into heaven,

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.785
and siteth upon
the right hand of God!

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:43.492
The power almighty.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:47.000
He shall come to judge
the quick and the dead.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:54.086
Demon, you have
no place here.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:55.716
I cast you!

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.813
I submit to the will of God.

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:16.321
I am God.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.276
You are a demon
and a coward!

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:20.783
And you hide in a child.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.284
You are a coward.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.492
In the name
of Jesus Christ,

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.202
I command you tell me
your name.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.040
You are mistaken.

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.796
She has invited me in.

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.173
No! No!

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.225
Get her away from him!

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:48.353
John? John!
Get the book. Get the book.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:58.567
In the name of Jesus Christ,
tell me your name.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:01.907
Thy kingdom...

01:15:02.123 --> 01:15:03.409
I rebuke you, Satan,

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:05.081
and all your dark angels,

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:07.329
in the name of Jesus Christ.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:08.661
Tell me your name!

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:06.392
I am the Lord.

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:12.145
I will not fail to punish
your children and grandchildren

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:15.067
for the sins
of their parents.

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:17.896
I rebuke you, Satan,

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:21.199
and all your dark angels,
in the name of Jesus Christ.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.197
Tell me your name!

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.642
Ashley?

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.027
Ashley.

01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:03.324
Ashley, where are you?

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:05.910
Ashley.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:08.947
Ashley?

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.427
Tanya, please help me.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.178
I just want to go home.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.764
Okay. Come, come...

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.772
It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.456
Get her back
to the church.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.945
Jordan.

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:06.694
Jordan, you need
to come home.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:20.124
Tanya, you shouldn't be here.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:24.841
I am not going anywhere.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.429
Then I have something
to show you.

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:54.154
May God bring you peace, Kyle.

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:10.469
May God bring you peace, Ashley.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.086
May God bring you peace, Sarah.
