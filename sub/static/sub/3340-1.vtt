05:03.612 --> 05:05.698
Good God.

05:14.872 --> 05:18.624
Matthew.
Matthew.

05:20.001 --> 05:21.961
Matthew.

05:22.086 --> 05:24.462
They say your whole life
flashes before your eyes...

05:24.497 --> 05:27.055
when you die.

05:27.090 --> 05:30.509
And it's true...
even for a blind man.

05:36.764 --> 05:40.816
I grew up in Hell's Kitchen.

05:40.851 --> 05:44.479
The politicians and the real estate developers
call it Clinton now...

05:44.514 --> 05:48.322
but a neighborhood,
like everything else, has a soul.

05:48.357 --> 05:52.160
- He's about to cry.
- And souls don't change with the name.

05:52.195 --> 05:55.530
- Come on, shrimp. Hit me.
I'll give you a free shot.
- Hit him again.

05:55.565 --> 05:57.664
- You fight like your dad.
- Yeah.

05:57.699 --> 06:00.326
- Come on. Hit me.
- My dad's gonna be champ.

06:00.451 --> 06:04.078
- Your dad's a bum. Come on. Hit me.
- Yeah. A bum.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.254
He's a punk.

06:06.289 --> 06:08.791
- Yeah. He's a punk.
- Can't fight.
Sure can run though.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.924
Pathetic.

06:10.959 --> 06:13.510
My father was a boxer.

06:13.545 --> 06:17.298
- A sportswriter once wrote
that he fought like the devil...

06:17.333 --> 06:19.891
and the name stuck.

06:19.926 --> 06:22.427
Jack "The Devil" Murdock
was a contender.

06:23.887 --> 06:26.889
But that was a long time ago.

06:26.924 --> 06:29.725
Come on, Dad.
Get up.

06:36.481 --> 06:38.982
- Who won?
- Cohan.

06:39.017 --> 06:41.033
Yeah?

06:41.068 --> 06:44.076
- I beat him, you know.
- I know, Dad.

06:44.111 --> 06:48.991
- T.K.O.
- That's right, Matty. You remember.

06:53.495 --> 06:56.664
- Hey. Hey, what's that?
- Nothin'.

06:56.699 --> 06:59.579
I told you I didn't
want you fightin'.

06:59.614 --> 07:02.460
I tried to walk away like you said...

07:02.495 --> 07:04.546
but they kept
givin' me shit.

07:04.671 --> 07:06.755
Don't curse.

07:06.839 --> 07:08.924
What kind of shit?

07:14.011 --> 07:18.849
They said that you work for Fallon,
that you're one of his guys now.

07:18.884 --> 07:21.852
Get over here. Sit down.

07:21.887 --> 07:23.936
Come on.

07:26.230 --> 07:28.440
You think I'd be pullin' double overtime
down at the docks...

07:28.475 --> 07:30.692
if I was workin'
for Fallon?

07:30.727 --> 07:33.576
What, are you nuts?

07:33.611 --> 07:36.655
You don't hit nothin' but books.
Get me?

07:36.690 --> 07:39.032
You be a doctor
or a lawyer.

07:39.067 --> 07:42.076
Not like me.

07:42.111 --> 07:44.335
Dad...

07:44.370 --> 07:47.671
Matt... you can do it.

07:47.706 --> 07:50.959
You can do anything
if you're not afraid.

07:50.994 --> 07:53.043
Now you promise me.

07:58.132 --> 08:00.550
I promise, Dad.

08:37.831 --> 08:40.812
Hey, John, pull that line all the way in...

08:40.847 --> 08:43.759
then bring the crane
around front, all right?

08:43.794 --> 08:46.859
Hey, kid! What are you trying
to get yourself killed?

08:46.894 --> 08:49.924
I'm lookin' for my dad,
Jack Murdock. You seen him?

08:49.959 --> 08:53.093
Murdock? Nah, he ain't
worked here in months.

08:53.128 --> 08:55.346
Now, beat it, huh?

09:16.822 --> 09:18.871
Jack, I don't want you to hurt me.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.617
- I will!
- Jack, come on. I got obligations.

09:21.652 --> 09:23.828
- Dad?
- Okay, I got it!

09:25.078 --> 09:27.163
Matt?

09:28.122 --> 09:31.250
Matt!

10:58.822 --> 11:00.699
No!

11:38.730 --> 11:42.483
Matty, I, uh, I talked
to the doctor...

11:42.518 --> 11:45.576
I'm blind.
I know.

11:45.611 --> 11:49.489
- How could you know?
- I heard you talking
in his office.

11:49.524 --> 11:51.706
I hear everything.

11:51.741 --> 11:56.245
Something's happening to me,
Dad. I don't know what it is.

12:02.083 --> 12:05.210
I'm sorry, Matty.

12:06.461 --> 12:08.547
I'm so sorry.

12:43.868 --> 12:46.619
We made each other a silent promise.

12:49.414 --> 12:52.333
To never give up.

12:52.368 --> 12:55.092
To be fearless.

12:55.127 --> 12:57.962
To stick up
for the long shots like us.

13:00.673 --> 13:03.300
We were two fighters
on the comeback trail.

13:08.596 --> 13:12.892
I had lost my sight,
but I got something back in return.

13:13.892 --> 13:17.026
My remaining four senses...

13:17.061 --> 13:19.646
functioned
with superhuman sharpness.

13:22.483 --> 13:24.734
But most amazing of all...

13:24.859 --> 13:28.488
my sense of sound gave off
a kind of radar sense.

13:49.588 --> 13:51.965
High above the roar
of the streets...

13:52.091 --> 13:55.301
I trained my body
and my senses.

13:56.677 --> 13:58.595
An acute sense of touch
gave me both strength and balance...

13:58.630 --> 14:00.514
An acute sense of touch
gave me both strength and balance...

14:03.934 --> 14:06.685
until the city itself
became my playground.

14:12.816 --> 14:15.527
I was the boy without fear.

14:15.562 --> 14:18.237
Whoo-hoo!

14:21.698 --> 14:24.075
The winner!

14:34.625 --> 14:37.294
Hey, Murdock! Round two.

14:41.297 --> 14:45.467
- What's up, freak?
- Look at him, man.
Look at his eyes.

14:45.502 --> 14:47.518
Hooo-ooh!

14:47.553 --> 14:50.222
- Kick his ass, man.
- Fight me. I dare ya.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.356
- Yeah, Murdock.
- I dare ya.

14:53.391 --> 14:55.560
That's what I'm sayin', Kick his ass.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.813
Come on, man.
Let's just go.

15:01.814 --> 15:04.108
Okay.

15:48.436 --> 15:50.396
Jack, it's been a while.

15:50.521 --> 15:53.857
I don't work for you no more, Fallon.

15:53.892 --> 15:56.825
Jack, you never stopped.

15:56.860 --> 16:00.821
Did you really think you won
those fights on your own?

16:00.856 --> 16:03.820
You're 42 years old.

16:03.855 --> 16:06.750
Miller, Mack, Bendez?

16:06.785 --> 16:09.788
They're all my fighters...

16:09.823 --> 16:11.872
just like you.

16:12.790 --> 16:15.959
And now it's your turn
to take a fall.

16:15.994 --> 16:19.378
Think about your boy, Jack.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.965
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing.

16:45.566 --> 16:47.652
Matty.

17:27.685 --> 17:30.062
Stop...
Stop clinching.

17:30.187 --> 17:33.398
Let him go.
Clean fight.

17:36.442 --> 17:40.195
No! Come on, Dad!
Come on, Dad! Get up!

17:40.230 --> 17:42.443
You can do it!
Come on!

17:42.478 --> 17:44.657
Come on, Dad!
Get up!

17:44.692 --> 17:47.285
Come on!

17:48.827 --> 17:51.224
Let's go!
Come on!

17:51.259 --> 17:53.754
Come on, Dad!
Get up!

17:53.789 --> 17:56.250
Never give up!
Remember?

17:58.335 --> 18:01.358
Yeah! Yeah!
Come on, Dad! All right!

18:01.393 --> 18:04.284
You all right? Murdock! You all right?

18:04.319 --> 18:07.176
- Okay. Let's fight!
- Go, Dad! Go!

18:15.224 --> 18:19.978
Ten! He's out!
Fight's over!

18:27.068 --> 18:30.737
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner,
by way ofknockout...

18:30.772 --> 18:34.573
Jack "The Devil"
Murdock!

18:46.291 --> 18:49.294
This one was for you, Matty.

18:50.836 --> 18:53.756
I waited outside of the Olympic
for my father.

18:53.881 --> 18:57.342
In some ways,
I'm still waiting.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.359
Finish him off!

19:18.902 --> 19:20.695
Dad!

20:11.111 --> 20:13.196
I can't see you, Dad.

20:15.824 --> 20:18.409
I can't see you.

20:40.302 --> 20:42.387
No one cared much about the death...

20:42.422 --> 20:45.223
of a washed-up prizefighter.

20:45.258 --> 20:47.398
Nobody but me.

20:47.433 --> 20:49.775
I would keep my promise.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.520
I would help those
that others wouldn't.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.231
I would seek justice...

20:55.266 --> 20:57.438
one way...

20:57.473 --> 20:59.610
or another.

22:48.366 --> 22:52.828
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're here today...

22:52.863 --> 22:55.618
to seek truth...

22:55.653 --> 22:58.339
to seek justice.

22:58.374 --> 23:01.259
Mr. Quesada, would you
state for the court...

23:01.294 --> 23:05.047
the sequence of events
leading up to the night ofJune 30?

23:05.082 --> 23:09.068
I stopped off atJosie's Bar
after work.

23:09.103 --> 23:13.019
I had a few drinks.
Angela was there.

23:13.054 --> 23:17.015
She was closing up.
She asked me if I wanted to stick around...

23:17.974 --> 23:20.142
for some fun.

23:22.144 --> 23:25.230
Anything that happened after that
was entirely consensual.

23:31.485 --> 23:35.037
- Are you aware that perjury is a crime,
Mr. Quesada?
- Objection.

23:35.072 --> 23:37.720
My client is a respectable member
of the community, where Miss Sutton...

23:37.755 --> 23:40.368
- has a history of drug and alcohol abuse...
- My client is not on trial.

23:40.493 --> 23:43.078
- Which not only makes
her testimony suspect...
- Nor is her testimony suspect.

23:43.113 --> 23:45.372
- Gentlemen, that's enough.
- The truth is...

23:45.407 --> 23:49.833
Mr. Murdock,
is that Miss Sutton...

23:49.958 --> 23:53.837
Miss Sutton enjoyed
every minute of it.

23:56.214 --> 24:00.223
Mr. Quesada,
for your sake...

24:00.258 --> 24:02.678
I hope justice
is found here today...

24:06.639 --> 24:08.724
before justice finds you.

24:09.850 --> 24:13.728
Matt? Matt, where
are you going?

24:14.771 --> 24:16.856
Man, we knew this was a risk
going in.

24:16.940 --> 24:19.775
Why? She's from the Kitchen,
she's not from the Upper East Side?

24:19.810 --> 24:23.159
Yeah. Come on, Matt.
She has a history of drug abuse.

24:23.194 --> 24:27.073
- That was a long time ago.
- Juries don't like their victims flawed.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.750
It's not right.

24:31.785 --> 24:33.835
Yeah? Here's what
I don't get.

24:33.870 --> 24:37.081
How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsch?

24:37.116 --> 24:40.125
He can't. The Kingpin's
gotta be footing the bill.

24:41.376 --> 24:45.547
- Come on. Let's go get drunk.
- Not tonight.

24:45.582 --> 24:47.381
I got work to do.

26:05.279 --> 26:07.954
Line 'em up, Josie,
I'm ready to party tonight.

26:07.989 --> 26:11.742
You got a lot of nerve comin' in here
after what you did.

26:11.777 --> 26:15.079
Didn't you hear? I'm innocent, baby.

26:19.540 --> 26:22.377
Bikes behind the cage!

26:23.627 --> 26:26.129
No burn-outs,
you assholes!

26:30.091 --> 26:32.593
Whoo! Yeah!

26:47.480 --> 26:49.565
Hey, hey, hey!
What's happenin'?

26:51.650 --> 26:54.695
- Hey, Louie.
- What's up, goombah?

27:00.241 --> 27:03.306
To thejustice system, right?
Of course I beat it.

27:03.341 --> 27:06.371
Kingpin's got my back, bro.
How ya doin', sweetie?

27:06.406 --> 27:08.331
- Boss.
- What's up?

27:08.456 --> 27:10.416
What's up with that?

27:10.541 --> 27:12.626
Is that guy for real?

27:14.169 --> 27:16.761
Yeah, he's for real.

27:16.796 --> 27:19.590
- What do you want?
- Justice.

29:33.701 --> 29:35.869
Quesada!

29:37.037 --> 29:39.831
Time to give the devil
his due.

29:55.468 --> 29:57.637
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

31:00.731 --> 31:04.171
Hi. How ya doin'?

31:04.206 --> 31:07.577
Didn't you hear?

31:07.612 --> 31:10.113
- I was acquitted.
- Not by me.

31:13.450 --> 31:16.035
Who made you judge?

31:16.070 --> 31:19.622
Wh... You did.

31:32.215 --> 31:36.267
Go to hell... diablo.

31:36.302 --> 31:41.056
Okay, but you'll
beat me there.

31:51.481 --> 31:54.074
Hey. That light...

31:54.109 --> 31:56.450
at the end
of the tunnel?

31:56.485 --> 31:59.495
Guess what?
That's not heaven.

31:59.530 --> 32:02.865
- I'll kill you!
- That's the "C" Train.

32:02.991 --> 32:04.826
Oh, my God!

32:14.333 --> 32:16.836
Hey. You can't
go past there.

32:16.871 --> 32:19.219
- Call Charlie.
- Right.

32:19.254 --> 32:21.721
You're wastin'
your time, Urich.

32:21.756 --> 32:24.758
- There's nothin' to see here.
- Jose Quesada...

32:28.178 --> 32:30.805
and the rest
ofJose Quesada.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.433
Whole lotta nothin'.
Huh, Nick?

32:33.516 --> 32:36.518
You keep runnin' those stories,
and we're gonna end up with
a bunch of copycat vigilantes...

32:36.553 --> 32:38.520
who are gonna
get themselves killed.

32:38.604 --> 32:43.024
Are you here to confirm that Daredevil
is responsible for this, Detective?

32:43.059 --> 32:45.401
Come on, Urich.
Stop bustin' my...

32:47.485 --> 32:50.697
There is no proof that your so-called
Daredevil was involved...

32:50.732 --> 32:53.198
nor that
he even exists.

32:53.233 --> 32:55.701
Got it?

33:07.294 --> 33:09.379
Got it.

33:28.895 --> 33:31.605
Can one man make a difference?

33:31.640 --> 33:34.281
There are days
when I believe...

33:34.316 --> 33:36.276
and others when I have
lost all faith.

34:09.428 --> 34:13.563
Matt, it's Heather. Are you there?

34:13.598 --> 34:16.935
Of course you're not there.
You're never there.

34:16.969 --> 34:19.318
At least not for me.

34:19.353 --> 34:22.001
Look, I didn't wanna do this
over the phone...

34:22.036 --> 34:24.649
but it's not like you've
given me any choice.

34:24.684 --> 34:26.943
I mean, it's been
three months now...

34:27.025 --> 34:29.945
and I've never even
seen your apartment.

34:30.070 --> 34:33.407
Every time we sleep together,
I wake up in the morning alone.

34:33.442 --> 34:37.333
I mean, Jesus, where do you go
at 3:00 in the morning?

34:37.368 --> 34:42.163
I thought that if I waited,
if I was patient enough, you'd let me in...

34:44.456 --> 34:47.585
that we'd take our relationship
to the next level.

34:47.620 --> 34:51.719
Then I realized
that this is the next level.

34:51.755 --> 34:55.300
Good-bye, Matt. I hope you find
what you're looking for.

36:08.485 --> 36:11.196
Please, don't hurt me.

36:11.279 --> 36:14.323
Please, don't do that.

37:13.122 --> 37:17.417
Shh. Sleep now.

37:41.061 --> 37:43.689
Listen to this. "Eyewitnesses say that
Quesada was singled out...

37:43.724 --> 37:47.400
by the demonic vigilante
known as the Daredevil."

37:47.435 --> 37:49.277
I don't know why
you read that trash.

37:49.402 --> 37:53.655
- I've been hearin' stories for years.
Gotta be somethin' to it.
- Like alligators in the sewers?

37:53.690 --> 37:57.825
There are alligators in the sewers.
I got a friend in Sanitation. He's seen them.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.584
Fine. Just drop it.

37:59.619 --> 38:02.210
You should see this guy.
They got this picture...

38:02.245 --> 38:05.665
- They have a picture?
- It's, like, a drawing, an artist's rendering.

38:05.790 --> 38:07.923
It's just...
It's grotesque.

38:07.958 --> 38:11.343
I'd hate to see this guy's
therapy bills.

38:11.378 --> 38:14.506
Speaking of bills, your client Mr. Lee,
he made his first payment.

38:14.541 --> 38:17.634
- That's great. You should be very happy.
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

38:17.759 --> 38:20.824
He paid in fluke.
Fluke is a fish, Matt.

38:20.859 --> 38:23.770
Did you know that?
I sure as hell didn't.

38:23.805 --> 38:26.307
Mr. Lee is a good man, and he...
doesn't have a lot of money...

38:26.342 --> 38:28.691
and he goes fishing
on the weekends.

38:28.726 --> 38:32.562
I go salsa dancing weekends, but I don't
shake my ass to pay my phone bill.

38:32.597 --> 38:34.946
Pass the honey, please.

38:34.981 --> 38:38.699
We need some better clients.
I'm tired of these pro bono cases.

38:38.734 --> 38:41.611
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.

38:41.646 --> 38:45.073
Decent people. What's your idea of "better"?
Define "better."

38:47.366 --> 38:51.015
- What would be a better client?
- "Better" means rich and guilty. Okay?

38:51.050 --> 38:54.664
Remember when they taught us in law
school how to create a moral vacuum...

38:54.699 --> 38:56.958
so you could represent people
who aren't all necessarily innocent?

38:56.993 --> 38:59.042
That was your best course,
as I recall.

38:59.077 --> 39:01.874
You don't have
a moral vacuum.

39:01.909 --> 39:04.270
You are completely vacuumless.

39:04.305 --> 39:06.597
And what happened
to your face?

39:06.632 --> 39:08.933
Nothing. A small cut.
I walked into a door.

39:08.968 --> 39:13.812
Every time you disappear,
we can't get ahold of you,
you come in all cut up.

39:13.847 --> 39:18.767
I'm in the fight club.
The first rule of fight club:
Don't talk about fight club.

39:18.802 --> 39:21.478
- You're not in the fight club,
you're out of it.
- I didn't see the movie.

39:21.513 --> 39:24.237
I'm sure it's a funny joke,
but I didn't see it.

39:24.272 --> 39:28.323
Okay, all I'm sayin'
is I'm here for you as a friend.

39:28.358 --> 39:32.112
I hate to bring it up again, but I spent
$3,000 on that Seeing Eye dog.

39:32.147 --> 39:34.697
- I didn't ask you for the dog.
- Can I say something else?

39:34.732 --> 39:38.415
Seeing Eye dogs bond for life...
yours ran away.

39:38.450 --> 39:41.369
What does that tell you about
how emotionally available you are?

39:44.080 --> 39:47.937
What? What? Where? Where?

39:47.972 --> 39:51.794
Front door.
Not yet. Soon.

39:54.714 --> 39:56.798
Now.

40:04.722 --> 40:08.022
Tell me.

40:08.057 --> 40:11.151
- You want the truth?
- Absolutely.

40:11.186 --> 40:15.230
She's hideous.
I don't know if it's a fungus...

40:15.265 --> 40:17.406
or some sort of
congenital birth defect.

40:17.441 --> 40:21.068
But as your attorney in this matter,
I advise you...

40:21.103 --> 40:22.987
take no further action.

40:28.408 --> 40:31.827
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.

40:32.036 --> 40:35.129
Uh... I was just
looking for some honey.

40:35.164 --> 40:39.250
- Could you help me out?
- Right in front of you.

40:39.285 --> 40:41.384
Well...

40:41.419 --> 40:43.587
could you be a little bit
more specific?

40:43.712 --> 40:47.194
- What are you...
- Blind? Yeah.

40:47.229 --> 40:50.676
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

40:50.711 --> 40:52.887
The, uh...

40:54.429 --> 40:58.183
- Friend of yours?
- I've never seen him before.

40:59.683 --> 41:01.435
Matt Murdock.

41:02.770 --> 41:05.396
Nice to meet you,
Matt Murdock.

41:05.480 --> 41:08.733
Nice to meet you.
Uh...

41:11.360 --> 41:13.320
I didn't get your name.

41:15.113 --> 41:17.073
I didn't give it.

41:22.911 --> 41:25.539
I tell ya, some people have no compassion
for the handicapped.

41:25.574 --> 41:27.623
Apparently not.

41:30.209 --> 41:32.502
- Where you goin'?
- Gonna file an appeal.

41:32.537 --> 41:34.796
We have to be in the courthouse
by noon.

41:34.831 --> 41:37.924
- 12:00, Matt.
- I'll be there.

41:48.141 --> 41:52.227
- What do you want?
- I just wanted to get your name.

41:52.262 --> 41:56.102
- I didn't want any trouble.
- Look...

41:56.137 --> 41:59.942
I don't like being followed,
so don't.

41:59.977 --> 42:01.742
Uh, wait a minute.

42:01.777 --> 42:05.696
Wait a second.
Take it easy.

42:05.731 --> 42:09.581
And I don't like
being touched.

42:09.616 --> 42:12.536
Why don't you tell me what you do like,
and we'll start there.

42:29.758 --> 42:32.225
Sure you're blind?

42:32.260 --> 42:34.220
Sure you don't wanna
tell me your name?

43:02.577 --> 43:04.662
- You're holding back.
- Yes.

43:04.787 --> 43:06.663
Don't.

43:10.375 --> 43:13.294
Does every guy have to go through
all this to find out your name?

43:13.329 --> 43:15.713
Try asking for my number.

43:16.963 --> 43:20.300
Fight! Fight! Fight!

43:38.857 --> 43:41.567
Stop hitting me.

43:41.602 --> 43:43.444
Okay.

43:49.991 --> 43:52.201
My name's
Elektra Natchios.

43:54.370 --> 43:56.454
Thanks. That's all
I wanted to know.

44:03.460 --> 44:05.636
I have to go.

44:05.671 --> 44:08.304
Go? Wait a second.
Hold on.

44:08.339 --> 44:10.842
D- Don't... I don't wanna
get my ass kicked again...

44:10.877 --> 44:12.844
I just want to know
why you have to go.

44:15.011 --> 44:17.013
My bodyguard is here.

44:17.048 --> 44:19.849
Your bodyguard?

44:19.932 --> 44:22.935
If you need a bodyguard,
I'm in serious trouble.

44:24.019 --> 44:26.396
I thought I lost him
at the coffee shop.

44:26.431 --> 44:28.446
Dad can be a little
overprotective.

44:28.481 --> 44:32.776
Oh, "Natchios." Right,
as in "Nikolas Natchios."

44:32.811 --> 44:35.779
That's Dad.

44:41.284 --> 44:43.618
How am I going
to find you?

44:45.787 --> 44:47.955
You won't.

44:51.625 --> 44:53.793
I'll find you.

45:05.386 --> 45:07.472
Shit!

45:44.252 --> 45:48.130
- What's wrong, Wesley?
- Have you seen the papers today?

45:48.165 --> 45:50.712
Somebody's
been talking.

45:50.747 --> 45:53.259
Somebody always does.

45:56.887 --> 46:00.189
Wesley, did you know,
back in ancient times...

46:00.224 --> 46:05.520
they would cut the tongues
out of their bodyguards
their first day on the job?

46:07.188 --> 46:09.752
You think that's horrible,
don't you?

46:09.787 --> 46:12.317
'Cause you don't like
the physical stuff.

46:14.402 --> 46:16.487
I do.

46:31.374 --> 46:34.592
Whoo!

46:34.627 --> 46:37.045
Wesley, handkerchief.

46:44.969 --> 46:47.937
Your 11:00 is here.

46:47.972 --> 46:52.142
Natchios,
my dear old friend.

47:02.233 --> 47:06.528
I'm getting out, Wilson.
Uh... I am out.

47:06.653 --> 47:11.205
You think it's funny?

47:11.240 --> 47:14.513
They're writing about the Kingpin.

47:14.548 --> 47:17.752
They're going back
to the beginning.

47:17.787 --> 47:21.214
Oh, I'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.

47:21.249 --> 47:23.917
I wanna put all that behind me.
I want you to buy me out.

47:23.952 --> 47:27.588
I think you'll find this
a very generous offer.

47:30.506 --> 47:32.592
So, what do you say?

47:46.144 --> 47:48.104
How's your daughter?

47:53.025 --> 47:55.444
I said I was sorry. What do you want?

47:55.479 --> 47:57.820
Details.
You owe me that.

48:00.114 --> 48:02.165
Her name's
Elektra Natchios.

48:02.200 --> 48:04.750
She sounds like
a Mexican appetizer.

48:04.785 --> 48:09.288
It's Greek, genius.
Her father's Nikolas Natchios.

48:10.539 --> 48:13.758
- The billionaire?
- Yeah. See? Yes, the billionaire.

48:13.793 --> 48:17.128
Then as your attorney in this matter,
I advise you to marry the woman immediately.

48:17.163 --> 48:19.262
I'll take it
under consideration.

48:19.297 --> 48:23.384
- What do we got?
- Oh, this one's a real winner.

48:23.419 --> 48:25.343
DaunteJackson,
ex-con from Queens...

48:25.468 --> 48:27.845
charged with the August 9th
murder of Lisa Tazio...

48:27.880 --> 48:29.896
your friendly neighborhood
prostitute.

48:29.931 --> 48:32.641
The bad news is Jackson
was found passed-out in an alley...

48:32.676 --> 48:34.775
holding the murder weapon...

48:34.810 --> 48:38.361
and enough THC in his lungs
to get Staten Island high.

48:38.396 --> 48:41.315
Jackson says he can't remember
what happened on the night of the murder...

48:41.350 --> 48:43.274
or, for that matter,
most of the '90s.

48:43.400 --> 48:47.153
- What's the good news?
- The fluke wasn't bad. Could you let us in?

48:53.158 --> 48:55.243
Mr. Jackson.

48:56.327 --> 48:58.378
Who are you?

48:58.413 --> 49:01.165
We're your attorneys.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.882
If you're innocent.

49:03.917 --> 49:07.878
So, are you...
innocent?

49:07.913 --> 49:12.013
Yeah.

49:12.048 --> 49:14.759
Hell yeah.

49:17.886 --> 49:20.097
I believe you.

49:20.132 --> 49:22.022
Y- You do?

49:22.057 --> 49:25.935
- You do?
- You got yourself a defense.

49:28.603 --> 49:32.607
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

49:34.775 --> 49:36.860
I want you to create
a paper trail...

49:36.895 --> 49:38.911
one that can be
traced to Natchios.

49:38.946 --> 49:44.576
- Sir?
- The press want a kingpin,
so I'll give 'em a kingpin.

49:44.611 --> 49:46.785
Get me Bullseye.

50:23.566 --> 50:25.734
Two out of three.

50:40.580 --> 50:42.956
Bloody Irish piece of trash.

51:34.874 --> 51:37.711
What do you thinkJackson's
gonna pay us with? Chronic?

51:37.746 --> 51:39.636
- Foggy.
- Hey, the guy's a three-time loser.

51:39.671 --> 51:41.964
They found him a block away
with the murder weapon.

51:41.999 --> 51:44.258
Which makes the fact
that he's innocent interesting.

51:44.293 --> 51:46.182
How can you be
so sure?

51:46.217 --> 51:48.553
- Have I ever been wrong?
- No. Which is really starting to annoy me.

51:48.588 --> 51:51.520
Hey! Come on,
I got a blind guy here!

51:51.555 --> 51:56.143
- Use the crosswalk, asshole.
- I love this city.

52:12.072 --> 52:14.991
Empty your pockets.

52:28.586 --> 52:30.755
Raise your arms.

53:15.458 --> 53:18.342
All right.
This is it.

53:18.377 --> 53:21.511
- Okay, now what?
- Take a look around.

53:21.546 --> 53:24.340
I know you have a built-in
bullshit detector...

53:24.375 --> 53:26.515
but this time
it's on the blink.

53:26.550 --> 53:29.969
- Let's sayJackson is innocent...
- He is innocent.

53:30.004 --> 53:32.801
Then why go through the trouble
to set him up?

53:32.836 --> 53:35.599
Why the big cover-up
in the death of a prostitute?

53:35.724 --> 53:37.941
I don't know.
I can't answer that.

53:37.976 --> 53:41.611
I gotta find out more
about Lisa Tazio.

53:41.646 --> 53:44.899
Well, you know,
too bad we don't have a key.

53:46.733 --> 53:49.569
Matt, Matt,
where are you going?

53:52.488 --> 53:55.825
- Give me your pen.
- Right here. Leave a note?

53:57.159 --> 54:00.745
- Here.
- That's my pen.

54:13.965 --> 54:16.049
I must've been sick
the day they taught that.

54:16.084 --> 54:19.059
Was that
real estate law?

54:19.094 --> 54:23.521
- What do you see?
- What do I see? I see high ceilings...

54:23.556 --> 54:28.351
I see hardwood floors under carpet,
I see some good feng shui...

54:28.386 --> 54:31.604
Think they rented this place yet?

55:23.730 --> 55:25.982
What did she have
a puppy?

55:26.107 --> 55:30.152
- Ammonia.
- So what?

55:30.187 --> 55:32.942
Over blood.

55:32.977 --> 55:35.538
Something else.

55:35.573 --> 55:38.743
Cordite... gunpowder.

55:41.745 --> 55:43.830
She was shot here
and dragged outside...

55:43.865 --> 55:45.916
to make it look
like a random robbery.

55:55.298 --> 55:57.800
Come on, Matt,
there's nothin'over there. Let's go.

55:59.593 --> 56:02.227
Write this down.

56:02.262 --> 56:04.889
She wrote something here
in a ballpoint pen.

56:04.924 --> 56:06.766
The imprint is still
in the wood.

56:06.801 --> 56:10.370
- "M-O-M."
- "M-O-M."

56:10.405 --> 56:13.904
- "6-8."
- "6-8."

56:13.939 --> 56:16.530
There. I knew it.
Her mother did it.

56:16.565 --> 56:19.575
Now can we please go
before we need attorneys too?

56:19.610 --> 56:24.030
Susie is my son Larry's daughter
by his first marriage.

56:24.065 --> 56:28.450
She eloped with this semi-colored fella
from London.

56:28.485 --> 56:30.501
What's the word for that?
Mulatto. Yeah.

56:30.536 --> 56:33.872
Just let's say he had a little cream
in his coffee.

56:33.907 --> 56:37.208
But he did very well for himself
on the Internet...

56:37.243 --> 56:39.174
but don't ask me how.

56:39.209 --> 56:43.046
You know, they did get me
a computer for Christmas last year.

56:43.081 --> 56:46.590
But I won't use it. I'm afraid
it's going to explode.

56:46.625 --> 56:49.182
Oh, but who can afford
to fly these days?

56:49.217 --> 56:54.930
But then my sister Marjorie
called and said she had
these frequent flyer miles...

56:54.965 --> 56:58.684
and she couldn't use them
because her sciatic nerve was acting up.

56:58.719 --> 57:01.602
So I said...

57:16.073 --> 57:17.386
Oh. She's sleeping.

57:17.421 --> 57:18.700
Oh. She's sleeping.

57:18.825 --> 57:23.704
- Can I get you anything before we land?
- More peanuts, please.

57:23.739 --> 57:25.789
Bill Evert here
at the Manhattan Courthouse...

57:25.914 --> 57:28.082
where accused killer
DaunteJackson...

57:28.117 --> 57:30.251
Jackson is accused of gunning down...

57:33.713 --> 57:36.805
Ladies and Gentlemen
of the jury...

57:36.840 --> 57:40.475
I am not here to convice you
that DaunteJackson is a model citizen.

57:40.510 --> 57:45.681
He has been in and out
of prisons and reform schools
since he was 12 years old...

57:45.716 --> 57:48.183
but this is not a court
of character, however...

57:48.218 --> 57:50.185
This is a court of law.

57:50.268 --> 57:52.651
Isn't he facing
the wrong way?

57:52.686 --> 57:54.772
Don't worry, he's got them
right where he wants them.

57:54.807 --> 57:57.691
- DaunteJackson is innocent.
- Yeah.

57:58.942 --> 58:02.487
And that is what it's been like
for Mr. Jackson.

58:02.522 --> 58:05.245
Like trying to talk
to a wall.

58:05.280 --> 58:09.283
Does this defense come with
a two-drink minimum, Mr. Murdock?

58:09.367 --> 58:13.204
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I'm trying to make a point.

58:13.239 --> 58:16.039
You see, justice is blind...

58:16.074 --> 58:19.341
but it can be heard...

58:19.376 --> 58:22.795
and, today, the truth will come out.
Thank you.

58:24.463 --> 58:26.846
Here, r-r-right this way.

58:26.881 --> 58:30.635
He's blind.
He can't see anything.

58:30.670 --> 58:32.737
Okay, here's the, uh, the arm.

58:32.772 --> 58:34.664
You got the arm there,
Matt?

58:34.699 --> 58:36.556
Just reach down.
There you go.

58:36.591 --> 58:39.409
I'm sorry.

58:39.444 --> 58:41.943
Here we go.

58:41.978 --> 58:46.363
You got it?
Okay.

58:46.398 --> 58:49.365
- Was that too much?
- Yeah, it was a little much.

58:49.400 --> 58:52.945
You always want to do the chair thing.
It's embarrassing.

58:52.980 --> 58:55.203
- We want sympathy, it's not The Gong Show.
- Okay.

58:55.238 --> 58:59.492
Officer McKensie, you were
the arriving officer at the scene?

58:59.527 --> 59:03.627
- That's correct.
- Please tell us what you observed.

59:03.662 --> 59:09.333
I was a block away when I got the call
of shots being fired.

59:09.368 --> 59:11.727
When I arrived on the scene,
Lisa Tazio's body...

59:11.762 --> 59:14.087
was lying dead
on the steps of her apartment.

59:16.423 --> 59:19.598
I found Jackson passed out in the alley.

59:19.633 --> 59:22.309
- Still holding the murder weapon.
- What's wrong?

59:22.344 --> 59:26.431
- Tazio's wallet in his pocket.
- McKensie's telling the truth.

59:26.466 --> 59:29.617
Yeah, that happens
sometimes in court.

59:29.652 --> 59:32.769
No, no, no, no.
Somebody has to be lying.

59:36.856 --> 59:39.025
- What's he doing here?
- Who?

59:40.484 --> 59:45.488
It's Ben Urich,
the reporter from the Post.

59:54.454 --> 59:58.123
So does this mean you want a rematch?

59:58.158 --> 01:00:00.083
I told you
I'd find you.

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:06.213
How did you know I wasn't a mugger?

01:00:07.882 --> 01:00:11.885
Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels...

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.970
at least this far
from Chelsea.

01:00:16.138 --> 01:00:18.188
Come here.

01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:22.810
- There's something I wanna show you.
- Wait a second.

01:00:22.845 --> 01:00:25.313
Exactly how many women
have you brought up here?

01:00:25.396 --> 01:00:29.531
Uh... you're my first.

01:00:29.566 --> 01:00:32.735
- Good answer.
- I thought that was the right answer.

01:00:36.238 --> 01:00:40.624
Look at this. It's so beautiful.

01:00:40.659 --> 01:00:44.161
I know. This was my favorite
view of the city when I was a kid.

01:00:44.196 --> 01:00:46.789
I really wanted you
to see this.

01:01:03.469 --> 01:01:05.519
What's this?

01:01:05.554 --> 01:01:08.598
Oh, that's from
my mother.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:11.566
For good luck.

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:15.527
It's beautiful.
It's a good luck charm, huh?

01:01:15.562 --> 01:01:18.690
I could use one of those.
They make them in braille?

01:01:21.818 --> 01:01:26.196
She gave it to me...
right before she died.

01:01:26.231 --> 01:01:28.365
What happened?

01:01:29.533 --> 01:01:31.701
She was killed...

01:01:33.619 --> 01:01:36.204
right in front of me...
I was five.

01:01:37.122 --> 01:01:39.506
I'm sorry.

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:43.711
No Greek tragedies, okay?

01:01:43.794 --> 01:01:45.879
Okay.

01:01:48.798 --> 01:01:51.516
- I should go.
- No, no. Wait. Just wait.

01:01:51.551 --> 01:01:54.886
Wait, wait, wait.
Because it-it's... It's about to rain.

01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:58.187
- No, it's not.
- It is. It's... I'm telling you.

01:01:58.222 --> 01:02:00.891
The temperature dropped
two or three degrees. I can smell it.

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:04.832
The moisture in the air.
It's gonna rain any second now.

01:02:04.867 --> 01:02:08.488
And when it rains, it's like
there's a rooftop on the world.

01:02:08.523 --> 01:02:13.235
Each raindrop makes a sound
the first time it falls on a surface.

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:15.195
Just then it's like I...

01:02:16.988 --> 01:02:19.240
It's like
I can see again.

01:02:20.617 --> 01:02:22.910
And I...
I just wanna...

01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:26.871
I just wanna see you.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:33.126
Okay.

01:02:33.251 --> 01:02:35.837
Look. Here it comes.

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:42.718
Ah.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.445
Oh, my God.

01:03:07.738 --> 01:03:09.823
You are so beautiful.

01:03:39.431 --> 01:03:42.892
Maybe you remember the Kingpin.

01:03:42.927 --> 01:03:45.812
You remember now?

01:03:45.895 --> 01:03:48.570
- What?
- Get off me!

01:03:48.605 --> 01:03:54.026
- Matt, what's wrong?
- You think you can
hold out on the Kingpin?

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.780
Matt.

01:03:58.738 --> 01:04:01.289
I have to go.

01:04:01.324 --> 01:04:03.410
- I'm sorry.
- You remember now?

01:04:05.703 --> 01:04:07.997
I have to go.

01:04:08.032 --> 01:04:10.203
Matt.

01:04:10.238 --> 01:04:12.375
Matt.

01:04:21.008 --> 01:04:23.426
Oh, no! No, no! Please!

01:04:27.262 --> 01:04:29.890
Huh? You remember me now?
What are you, stupid?

01:04:29.925 --> 01:04:31.975
You think you can
hold out on the Kingpin?

01:04:52.408 --> 01:04:54.493
Get away from me!

01:05:19.305 --> 01:05:22.273
Stay out of Hell's Kitchen.

01:05:22.308 --> 01:05:25.852
This ain't
your neighborhood no more.

01:05:25.887 --> 01:05:29.397
Kitchen belongs
to the Kingpin now.

01:05:48.079 --> 01:05:51.297
Please!

01:05:51.332 --> 01:05:54.508
Please don't hurt me.

01:05:54.543 --> 01:05:57.462
I'm not the bad guy, kid.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.142
I'm not the bad guy.

01:06:17.895 --> 01:06:20.189
I'm not.

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:42.082
You know the great strength
of the Church?

01:06:43.876 --> 01:06:46.252
Its sense of community.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.754
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.550
Now, this may come
as a bit of a surprise to you, Matthew...

01:06:53.585 --> 01:06:56.051
but we are open
on Sundays.

01:06:58.762 --> 01:07:01.056
I like the quiet.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:04.309
I don't think so, son.
I think you like the solitude.

01:07:06.811 --> 01:07:11.690
And you find it in here,
do you, Matthew?

01:07:11.725 --> 01:07:13.983
Sometimes.

01:07:32.665 --> 01:07:35.216
Sometimes not.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:39.087
You don't have to
go it alone, Matthew.

01:07:39.213 --> 01:07:42.486
My confessional is open
to you all the time.

01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:45.725
There's no keepin'
secrets from God, son.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.889
You spend 30 years in one of them boxes,
there's nothing I haven't heard.

01:07:52.766 --> 01:07:56.519
Well, let's keep it
that way.

01:08:02.774 --> 01:08:05.275
So, we'll be seein' ya
Sunday then, huh?

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:28.837
- I'll have to call you back
because he just came in.

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:31.046
Good morning.

01:08:32.048 --> 01:08:34.466
- Your ears must have been burning.
- Why?

01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:37.017
This just came
by messenger.

01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:40.220
It's your invitation
to the Black & White Ball at the Grand.

01:08:40.256 --> 01:08:43.724
- Plus one.
- Plus one? All right.

01:08:44.975 --> 01:08:47.274
Coffee?

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:49.861
Uh, no. No, thank you.

01:08:49.895 --> 01:08:52.064
I'd love a cup, Karen.
Thank you.

01:08:57.068 --> 01:08:59.154
I guess she's making
a fresh pot.

01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:01.988
Wow.

01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:04.700
They spent some serious money
on this invitation.

01:09:04.734 --> 01:09:07.459
I mean, you should feel it.
It's engraved.

01:09:07.493 --> 01:09:10.830
- What time you gonna pick me up?
- I'm not goin'.

01:09:10.865 --> 01:09:13.005
What? Are you crazy?

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.020
That place is gonna be crawlin'
with people... rich people.

01:09:16.055 --> 01:09:19.615
People who pay their legal fees
with money, not with fish...

01:09:19.649 --> 01:09:23.174
or with-with-with wheels of cheese
or with sports supplies.

01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:25.526
I'm gonna fill you in
on a little secret, Matt.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.745
This place doesn't look
like a law office, okay?

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.894
It looks like the set
of goddamn Sanford and Son.

01:09:29.929 --> 01:09:33.473
Every time I walk in, I'm waiting for Lamont
to walk down the stairs.

01:09:33.508 --> 01:09:36.184
- Then you go.
- Look at me, Matt. I'm a "plus one," okay?

01:09:36.219 --> 01:09:38.151
Plus ones don't get
anywhere by themselves.

01:09:38.185 --> 01:09:40.729
They need somebody to bring them.
That's why it's "plus one."

01:09:40.764 --> 01:09:43.273
Are you finished? We only have an hour
to prepare for court.

01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:46.109
What's eating you?

01:09:48.611 --> 01:09:50.863
I had a...
a rough night.

01:09:52.448 --> 01:09:55.158
Well, you wanna
talk about it?

01:09:58.912 --> 01:10:01.413
No.

01:10:02.456 --> 01:10:05.756
- It's about Elektra, isn't it?
- No.

01:10:05.791 --> 01:10:09.962
Natchios owns the Grand Hotel,
and Elektra's the reason you
were invited to the ball.

01:10:11.713 --> 01:10:14.966
She's outta my league.
I'd rather just end it before it starts.

01:10:18.302 --> 01:10:20.436
That's gotta be
some kind of record.

01:10:20.471 --> 01:10:22.889
You just completely bypassed
the whole relationship phase.

01:10:22.972 --> 01:10:26.399
You went right to the breakup.
Tryin' to save some time, huh?

01:10:26.434 --> 01:10:30.187
What happens to that
lie detector of yours when it
detects your own bullshit?

01:10:30.222 --> 01:10:32.481
It must really
bury the needle, huh?

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.151
Swish.

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:41.238
Look, Matt, seriously,
the ball's in your court.

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:48.661
Plus one, huh?

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:53.748
Thank you.

01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:59.670
This is what
I'm talking about. Aren't you
happy you listened to me?

01:10:59.705 --> 01:11:02.839
This is gonna be great
for business, Matt.

01:11:02.874 --> 01:11:04.507
Thank you.

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:07.475
Matt Murdock.
Ben Urich, New York Post.

01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:11.019
Ben Urich. Nice to meet you.
You're the guy...

01:11:11.054 --> 01:11:15.724
- who writes the articles about
the urban legends, right?
- Well, yes, among other things.

01:11:15.759 --> 01:11:17.601
Maybe you could settle
something for us.

01:11:17.726 --> 01:11:19.776
You know the alligators
that live in the sewers?

01:11:19.811 --> 01:11:23.022
- My partner...
- I've been following that piece
you wrote about the Kingpin.

01:11:23.057 --> 01:11:26.066
One man running all the crime
in New York City...

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:28.117
it sounds a little
farfetched, doesn't it?

01:11:28.152 --> 01:11:32.530
Well, yeah. But then again
so's a vigilante who thinks
every day is Halloween.

01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:35.992
They got to be huge by now,
right, the alligators?

01:11:37.033 --> 01:11:39.501
It's a myth.

01:11:39.536 --> 01:11:44.832
Look, uh, I'd like you
to give me a call... Sorry.

01:11:48.376 --> 01:11:52.303
- Cool color.
- I wouldn't know.

01:11:52.338 --> 01:11:57.217
But do give me a call.
There is something I'd like
to talk to you about.

01:11:59.136 --> 01:12:01.352
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy the party.

01:12:01.387 --> 01:12:06.189
Uh, uh, uh. Look at that.
Wilson Fisk is in the "hizzie."

01:12:06.224 --> 01:12:10.145
Come on. We might never
get a chance like this again.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.986
- We should talk about this...
- Mr. Fisk.

01:12:12.021 --> 01:12:15.573
Mr. Fisk, it's, uh, uh, Franklin Nelson
from Nelson & Murdock...

01:12:15.608 --> 01:12:20.487
Excuse me. You want to talk to Mr. Fisk,
you make an appointment. Okay?

01:12:20.522 --> 01:12:24.121
Wesley.
I know who you are.

01:12:24.156 --> 01:12:26.866
You're the blind lawyers
from Hell's Kitchen.

01:12:26.901 --> 01:12:29.577
Actually... Actually,
he's the blind one.

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:31.794
I'm deaf.

01:12:31.829 --> 01:12:34.421
Give 'em a card, Wesley.

01:12:34.456 --> 01:12:37.007
I'm always on the lookout
for new blood.

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:41.337
I'm sorry, Mr. Fisk. My partner is a little
overzealous. We can't represent you.

01:12:41.372 --> 01:12:44.221
Why is that?

01:12:44.256 --> 01:12:46.306
Yes, why is that, Mr. Murdock?

01:12:46.341 --> 01:12:51.136
Because we only handle
clients who are innocent.

01:12:51.171 --> 01:12:55.397
Innocent, he says. That's pretty funny.

01:12:55.432 --> 01:12:58.226
You know, I've learned one thing
in all my years in this business.

01:12:58.261 --> 01:13:01.270
- What's that?
- Nobody's innocent.

01:13:02.604 --> 01:13:05.023
Nobody.

01:13:07.109 --> 01:13:09.902
- Have a great time at the party.
- Thank you.

01:13:11.278 --> 01:13:14.072
I just, you know...
Matt, for one night, I just wish...

01:13:15.115 --> 01:13:17.200
I just...

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.578
Matt, I just wish I could give you my eyes
for one night.

01:13:22.621 --> 01:13:26.165
- It's like that?
- It's like that.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:33.130
You want me to take you
up there, Matt? Matt?

01:13:33.165 --> 01:13:35.215
Matt?

01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:19.209
Now I found you.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.838
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

01:14:23.873 --> 01:14:26.424
You're here now.

01:14:28.508 --> 01:14:30.927
That's all that matters.

01:14:31.928 --> 01:14:34.430
Wow. Engraved
cufflinks, huh?

01:14:34.465 --> 01:14:36.932
Because it's
Wesley Owen Welch.

01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:40.289
Let's cut to the chase.
If this were up to me... and it is...

01:14:40.324 --> 01:14:43.486
Do you really think the Fisk Corporation
would actually hire...

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:48.609
some pro bono, storefront
Hell's Kitchen lawyers, let alone a blind one.

01:14:48.644 --> 01:14:50.909
Come on.
I've already filled...

01:14:50.944 --> 01:14:54.781
our quota of handicapped employees
for the year.

01:14:54.816 --> 01:14:59.451
Go back to the Kitchen,
Franklin Nelson.

01:15:03.871 --> 01:15:05.956
What a dick.

01:15:11.044 --> 01:15:13.755
You look
beautiful tonight.

01:15:21.052 --> 01:15:23.227
Do you mind?

01:15:23.262 --> 01:15:28.642
Uh, no. I just... Sometimes it makes people
uncomfortable, that's all.

01:15:30.102 --> 01:15:32.520
Not me.

01:15:33.687 --> 01:15:36.238
But you should know...

01:15:36.273 --> 01:15:39.818
that the only reason
I got dressed up for this thing...

01:15:39.853 --> 01:15:43.153
was that I wanted
to look beautiful for you.

01:15:45.989 --> 01:15:47.950
I wish you could
see me tonight.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.285
Me too.

01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:01.585
- Matt.
- What's wrong?

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.587
Uh, it's just...

01:16:05.172 --> 01:16:07.340
good things don't
happen to me very often.

01:16:07.424 --> 01:16:09.717
When they do,
I get scared.

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:14.221
Nothing bad
is gonna happen.

01:16:14.256 --> 01:16:16.306
I promise.

01:16:29.108 --> 01:16:31.735
Hi. Hello.

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:34.362
Hello.

01:16:37.282 --> 01:16:39.534
Hello.

01:16:46.748 --> 01:16:49.333
Oh, doesn't she look
beautiful?

01:16:49.368 --> 01:16:51.591
I think she's happy.

01:16:51.626 --> 01:16:55.797
I haven't seen her smile like that
since before her mother was killed.

01:16:55.832 --> 01:16:58.650
Poor girl.
Right in front ofher eyes.

01:16:58.685 --> 01:17:01.890
Why do you have
to bring that up now?

01:17:01.925 --> 01:17:05.061
History has a way
of repeating itself.

01:17:05.096 --> 01:17:09.266
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying good-bye, old friend.

01:17:11.685 --> 01:17:14.479
I'm just saying
good-bye.

01:17:20.025 --> 01:17:22.110
Gus.

01:17:29.283 --> 01:17:32.535
- Something's happening. Papa.
- What is it?

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:39.791
- Go back to the party.
- What's wrong?

01:17:39.826 --> 01:17:43.753
Elektra!
Stavros will take you home.

01:17:43.788 --> 01:17:46.888
Papa? Papa?

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:49.591
Tell me where you're going.

01:17:51.802 --> 01:17:54.096
You wait... Ooh!

01:17:59.433 --> 01:18:01.726
I'm sorry.

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:46.722
- What is going on? Tell me.
- New York is not a safe place tonight.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.576
Watch out!

01:19:31.051 --> 01:19:34.053
I missed.
I never miss.

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.577
Drop somethin'?

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.891
Bullseye, huh?

01:21:12.926 --> 01:21:15.094
Daddy.

01:21:35.528 --> 01:21:37.577
Get that over
to Forensics right away.

01:21:37.612 --> 01:21:43.035
- Hey, Nick.
- What do you want, Urich?
Does all this make you happy?

01:21:45.036 --> 01:21:47.955
Looks like
you got your story.

01:22:26.528 --> 01:22:30.156
Police are still
investigating the murder
of Greek shipping heir...

01:22:30.239 --> 01:22:32.658
Nikolas Natchios
as the so-called Kingpin of crime...

01:22:32.784 --> 01:22:35.452
The self-styled vigilante
is wanted for murder.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:43.584
Now how did you
get past my security?

01:22:43.619 --> 01:22:46.687
Oh, you mean that guy?

01:22:46.722 --> 01:22:49.756
Was that really necessary?

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:52.848
Necessary, no.
It was fun.

01:22:52.883 --> 01:22:57.346
You know, you've exceeded
all my expectations.

01:22:57.471 --> 01:23:00.473
You even managed to implicate
Daredevil in the process.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.350
You should be pleased.

01:23:02.475 --> 01:23:06.144
He... made me...

01:23:07.896 --> 01:23:09.772
miss.

01:23:09.855 --> 01:23:15.276
There's an old saying that
"too much pride can kill a man."

01:23:19.698 --> 01:23:22.039
The Devil is mine.

01:23:22.074 --> 01:23:25.411
Really?
I've heard that before...

01:23:25.446 --> 01:23:27.784
all too many times.

01:23:27.819 --> 01:23:30.088
But answer me this.

01:23:30.123 --> 01:23:33.542
How do you kill a man
without fear?

01:23:33.577 --> 01:23:37.354
By puttin'
the fear in him.

01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:41.132
Ah. I like that.
But first...

01:23:46.344 --> 01:23:48.867
give Elektra all my best.

01:23:48.902 --> 01:23:51.390
Is there anything else?

01:23:52.307 --> 01:23:54.601
Yeah.

01:23:56.894 --> 01:24:00.023
I want a fuckin' costume.

01:24:04.609 --> 01:24:07.945
And what happened from there,
Mr. Jackson?

01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:10.031
Well, let's see,
uh...

01:24:10.156 --> 01:24:14.826
Man, I was so high,
I can't remember everything.

01:24:18.162 --> 01:24:21.498
Excuse me one second,
Your Honor, I'm working alone today.

01:24:21.533 --> 01:24:24.083
Just a second.

01:24:29.338 --> 01:24:32.132
It's braille.
It's braille.

01:24:34.092 --> 01:24:36.142
It says here, okay...

01:24:36.177 --> 01:24:38.929
Mr. Jackson, it says here
that you were...

01:24:38.964 --> 01:24:41.657
at Chumley's Tavern
until 10:15...

01:24:41.692 --> 01:24:44.351
and then you went
to meet a friend.

01:24:44.386 --> 01:24:46.275
Turk!

01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:50.584
- I went to meet Turk
because he owed me money.
- Yes!

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:54.859
And it was there that you
passed out from drinking, correct?

01:24:55.902 --> 01:24:58.612
Smoking weed, mostly.

01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:03.081
Thank you
for clarifying that.

01:25:03.116 --> 01:25:07.181
Now, Officer McKensie has testified
you were found holding a handgun.

01:25:07.216 --> 01:25:11.247
- That's a lie!
- In fact, you don't even
own a handgun, do you?

01:25:11.282 --> 01:25:15.122
- No, sir.
- Have you ever owned
a handgun, Mr. Jackson?

01:25:15.157 --> 01:25:18.962
- No, sir.
- Do you have any intention
of owning a handgun?

01:25:18.997 --> 01:25:21.179
- No, sir.
- Thank you.

01:25:21.214 --> 01:25:24.341
- Can't hit nothin'with a handgun.
- Thank you.

01:25:24.376 --> 01:25:27.469
But a shotgun, now that's
a whole different story.

01:25:27.594 --> 01:25:31.223
- Shotgun got buckshot... like little pellets.
- Thank you. That's all.

01:25:31.258 --> 01:25:34.357
When you shoot,
they just kind of spray out.

01:25:34.392 --> 01:25:37.311
Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

01:25:38.436 --> 01:25:39.688
Court's in recess!

01:25:40.939 --> 01:25:44.149
Mr. Nelson.

01:25:45.526 --> 01:25:50.405
For your sake, I hope your partner
comes back soon.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.324
Me too.
Me too.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:48.202
- I know how you feel.
- You don't know how I feel.

01:26:51.914 --> 01:26:54.333
I want revenge.

01:26:56.543 --> 01:27:02.131
Revenge won't make the pain go away.
Trust me. I know.

01:27:06.301 --> 01:27:11.138
- There's no place for me now.
- Yes, there is.

01:27:12.264 --> 01:27:16.351
Stay.
Stay with me.

01:27:18.227 --> 01:27:20.521
Please.

01:27:55.841 --> 01:27:58.135
Elektra. Elektra, wait.

01:28:00.012 --> 01:28:01.888
Please.

01:28:15.858 --> 01:28:18.151
Drive.

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:48.844
- Matt.
- Why are you following me?

01:28:48.879 --> 01:28:52.139
- It's Ben Urich.
- I know who it is.

01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:01.278
What do you want?

01:29:01.313 --> 01:29:03.481
Your client's innocent.

01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:19.001
Well?

01:29:19.036 --> 01:29:24.999
I had a source from my Kingpin story
named Lisa Tazio.

01:29:25.034 --> 01:29:28.627
- Lisa Tazio had access to the Kingpin?
- No.

01:29:28.662 --> 01:29:30.885
One of his guys...
pillow talk.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.173
She was selling me information bit by bit.
I never got a name.

01:29:34.256 --> 01:29:36.258
Will you testify
to that?

01:29:36.342 --> 01:29:40.762
Well, First Amendment and all that,
plus the case is still open.

01:29:40.797 --> 01:29:45.283
Is there anything that you can tell me
that will help my client?

01:29:45.318 --> 01:29:49.769
Yeah, I got a cousin over in Hoboken,
runs a Mercedes dealership.

01:29:49.804 --> 01:29:53.314
He sold a 500 SL...
to a Robert McKensie.

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:57.692
Officer McKensie.

01:29:57.817 --> 01:30:01.091
- That doesn't make sense.
He was telling the truth.
- Matt.

01:30:01.126 --> 01:30:04.365
That's three years cop's salary.
The guy ain't tellin' the truth.

01:30:15.457 --> 01:30:19.085
A future. Our future.
Our children.

01:30:32.221 --> 01:30:33.973
Hey.

01:30:35.474 --> 01:30:39.394
- Gotta love that new car smell, McKensie.
- Murdock, what the...

01:30:44.731 --> 01:30:48.484
Never driven one of these stick-shifts before.
How does this work?

01:30:48.519 --> 01:30:51.112
- Stop it!
- Take it easy, McKensie, we'll go for a ride.

01:30:51.195 --> 01:30:54.823
- This is a nice car. Where'd you get this?
- Lots of cops got Mercedes.

01:30:54.858 --> 01:30:57.450
Yeah? I bet.

01:30:59.827 --> 01:31:02.962
Jesus Christ!
You're crazy.

01:31:02.997 --> 01:31:05.373
Yeah, I'm crazy.
Who killed Lisa Tazio?

01:31:05.408 --> 01:31:07.166
DaunteJackson.

01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:12.462
Stop the goddamn car!

01:31:12.588 --> 01:31:15.923
Here's the hard part... parallel parking.
How is it? Like this?

01:31:19.343 --> 01:31:21.060
What do you want?

01:31:21.095 --> 01:31:24.764
I want to know why your goddamn
heart rate hasn't changed!

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.027
Shit.

01:31:32.062 --> 01:31:36.649
- When'd you get the pacemaker?
- Three years ago. So what?

01:31:36.684 --> 01:31:38.942
You lied in court.
That's perjury.

01:31:38.977 --> 01:31:41.618
You think I'm the only one?

01:31:41.653 --> 01:31:45.719
You take me down,
there's a hundred more to take my place.

01:31:45.754 --> 01:31:49.785
This is bigger than you, Murdock.
It's bigger than all of us.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:52.335
The Kingpin.

01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:55.671
He runs the whole
goddamn town.

01:31:55.706 --> 01:31:57.791
You cross him, you're gonna end up
like Natchios...

01:31:57.826 --> 01:32:00.711
eighty-sixed by some maniac
like Bullseye...

01:32:00.746 --> 01:32:03.212
and he won't stop there.

01:32:03.338 --> 01:32:07.633
- What does that mean?
- Kingpin doesn't just kill you...

01:32:07.668 --> 01:32:10.010
he kills your whole family.

01:32:26.482 --> 01:32:29.283
I have coffee.

01:32:29.318 --> 01:32:31.569
Did you get ahold
of Matt?

01:32:33.071 --> 01:32:35.739
No. He'll call.
Don't worry.

01:32:36.907 --> 01:32:39.493
- You should really get home, Karen.
- I'm fine.

01:32:39.528 --> 01:32:41.929
- How are you doing?
- Oh, me? I'm great.

01:32:41.964 --> 01:32:44.330
I'm making ridiculously
little progress...

01:32:44.413 --> 01:32:47.958
for the amount of time
I've invested in this.

01:32:47.993 --> 01:32:51.086
Is your mom
coming to town?

01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:53.761
- My mom? No.
- What's that note?

01:32:53.796 --> 01:32:57.611
Oh, that? That's Matt's
big contribution to the Tazio case...

01:32:57.646 --> 01:33:01.427
which has surprisingly turned out to be
completely useless.

01:33:01.462 --> 01:33:03.263
Mm.

01:33:04.346 --> 01:33:06.431
What's the date
of the murder?

01:33:07.349 --> 01:33:09.483
August 9th. Why?

01:33:09.518 --> 01:33:15.064
Maybe you're looking at it wrong?
August 9th.

01:33:24.113 --> 01:33:28.825
"August 9th. WOW."
WOW.

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.667
WOW, WOW, WOW.

01:33:30.702 --> 01:33:33.725
WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.505
Wesley Owen Welch.

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.250
Son of a bitch.

01:33:43.546 --> 01:33:45.505
Oh, cha-ching.

01:33:46.631 --> 01:33:48.717
This better
be good, Kirby.

01:33:50.926 --> 01:33:54.138
You know me, Urich.
It's always good.

01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:12.820
Okay. Are you ready to see something
really, really cool?

01:34:13.653 --> 01:34:15.822
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:34:17.324 --> 01:34:19.408
Ta-da!

01:34:21.577 --> 01:34:23.711
Oh, come on, man.
I'm throwin'you gold.

01:34:23.746 --> 01:34:26.581
- Give me my money. I've seen it. Come on.
- Why?

01:34:26.616 --> 01:34:29.584
All right. Well,
but have you seen this?

01:34:36.505 --> 01:34:39.842
And tighty-righty,
loosey-lefty.

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:45.138
You said look out
for anything weird, yes?

01:34:46.806 --> 01:34:50.142
Well, it's some pretty
weird shit right here, man, right?

01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:54.520
You have no idea.

01:35:02.027 --> 01:35:05.154
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is Franklin Nelson.

01:35:06.197 --> 01:35:08.282
Uh, this is not
a good time.

01:35:08.317 --> 01:35:10.450
It's about Lisa Tazio.

01:38:07.264 --> 01:38:09.620
Remember me?

01:38:09.655 --> 01:38:11.976
No. Wait.

01:38:13.018 --> 01:38:16.145
It wasn't me.

01:38:17.522 --> 01:38:20.190
It was a hit man
named Bullseye.

01:38:22.192 --> 01:38:25.736
- I didn't kill your father.
- Liar.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:05.561
- I'm not going to fight you.
- Good. Then this will be quick.

01:39:35.794 --> 01:39:38.839
I want to look into the eyes
of my father's killer as he dies.

01:39:38.874 --> 01:39:41.216
Wait. Wait.

01:39:46.845 --> 01:39:49.556
Now you know.

01:39:50.682 --> 01:39:55.269
- Oh, God.
- I was... just trying to protect you...

01:39:55.304 --> 01:39:57.371
um, Elektra.

01:39:57.406 --> 01:39:59.439
I'm sorry.

01:40:03.859 --> 01:40:08.578
That's him. That's Bullseye.
Listen to me.

01:40:08.613 --> 01:40:10.824
- You have to run.
- He has to pay for what he's done.

01:40:10.859 --> 01:40:12.874
No. You have to...

01:40:12.909 --> 01:40:14.868
I don't want
to lose you again.

01:40:16.537 --> 01:40:19.289
I'll find you.

01:40:21.874 --> 01:40:23.876
Come on, girl!

01:40:40.431 --> 01:40:45.144
Hey, orphan. Let's play.

01:40:51.566 --> 01:40:53.651
Nice. Come on.

01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:04.910
Ohh.

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.665
Oh.

01:42:15.092 --> 01:42:19.138
You're good, baby.
I'll give you that.

01:42:19.173 --> 01:42:21.056
But me?

01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:25.935
I'm magic.

01:42:50.956 --> 01:42:53.166
Now for my next trick.

01:42:55.668 --> 01:42:59.588
No! No!

01:43:20.856 --> 01:43:24.281
N. Y.P.D. Aviation.

01:43:24.316 --> 01:43:29.466
Do not move! Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.

01:43:29.501 --> 01:43:34.616
I repeat. Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.

01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:58.094
Help me.

01:44:00.597 --> 01:44:03.223
Stay...
Stay with me.

01:44:37.001 --> 01:44:38.961
Everything clear.

01:45:10.530 --> 01:45:13.448
Matthew. Matthew.

01:45:14.699 --> 01:45:16.785
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:45:20.246 --> 01:45:22.588
This is my confession,
Father.

01:45:22.623 --> 01:45:27.043
God's mercy is infinite.
All ya gotta do is ask.

01:45:27.078 --> 01:45:29.128
Everything I had
has been taken from me.

01:45:31.088 --> 01:45:33.382
Now I'm supposed to ask
for mercy.

01:45:33.465 --> 01:45:36.801
I don't ask for mercy...
people ask me.

01:45:36.836 --> 01:45:38.886
Oh, is that a fact?

01:45:45.392 --> 01:45:47.476
First one's a warning...

01:45:48.894 --> 01:45:50.861
Padre.

01:45:50.896 --> 01:45:52.897
Is there a back door
out of here?

01:45:52.981 --> 01:45:55.066
- Yeah.
- Take it. Call the police.

01:45:55.101 --> 01:45:57.449
What about you?

01:45:57.484 --> 01:46:00.988
- I have to finish this.
- But you can't fight like this, son.

01:46:01.023 --> 01:46:03.257
Have faith, Father.

01:46:03.292 --> 01:46:05.491
Isn't that right?

01:46:15.166 --> 01:46:19.170
You. Let's play.

01:47:58.418 --> 01:48:02.553
Caine, I want the blueprints
and the city grids.

01:48:02.588 --> 01:48:04.756
- Secure the perimeter.
Where's my SWAT team?
- Yes, sir.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.592
- The doors are locked from the inside, sir.
- Break 'em down.

01:48:07.627 --> 01:48:10.059
It's a church, sir.

01:48:10.094 --> 01:48:13.305
- Your point?
- Yes, sir.

01:48:13.431 --> 01:48:16.224
- Let's get a battering ram in here now.
- You got it.

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:18.032
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:49:18.067 --> 01:49:21.653
- Hey, Coyle, keep 'em in your sights.
- Which one?

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:25.239
- Both of'em! I want a man on that roof!
- Ready?

01:49:26.991 --> 01:49:29.291
Man without fear.

01:49:29.326 --> 01:49:33.246
- Looks like I found
somethin'you're afraid of.

01:49:33.281 --> 01:49:35.331
Let's bring on the pain.

01:49:38.501 --> 01:49:40.585
Let's bring on the noise.

01:49:54.347 --> 01:49:58.392
Fisk was right about you.
He said you wouldn't go easy.

01:49:58.427 --> 01:50:01.937
Fisk?
Fisk is the Kingpin?

01:50:01.972 --> 01:50:04.355
Yeah.

01:50:04.438 --> 01:50:06.941
The whole red rose thing?
He loves that shite.

01:50:06.976 --> 01:50:09.025
It's not my style.

01:50:16.198 --> 01:50:18.283
He hired me to kill Natchios.

01:50:19.368 --> 01:50:21.744
And to gut
your pretty girlfriend too.

01:50:24.247 --> 01:50:26.331
But me, I'm goin'
for the hat trick.

01:50:27.457 --> 01:50:29.876
I told him
I'd do you for free.

01:50:35.506 --> 01:50:38.425
The Devil is mine.

01:50:52.895 --> 01:50:54.980
Oh, my hands!
My hands!

01:50:59.693 --> 01:51:02.486
You took away my hands.

01:51:02.521 --> 01:51:05.239
Show mercy.

01:51:20.001 --> 01:51:22.086
Whoa!

01:51:28.467 --> 01:51:30.391
Bull's-eye.

01:51:30.426 --> 01:51:32.601
- Freeze!
- Whoa!

01:51:32.636 --> 01:51:34.811
Don't move!
Don't move!

01:51:34.846 --> 01:51:38.183
- Stay on him! Stay on him! Stay on him!
- Detective, look!

01:51:44.605 --> 01:51:47.023
Good luck, son.

01:51:51.527 --> 01:51:53.660
There's been a problem.

01:51:53.695 --> 01:51:56.864
- Bullseye failed.
- Correct.

01:51:56.899 --> 01:51:59.999
Then he'll be coming here
next.

01:52:00.034 --> 01:52:03.620
- Why would you say that?
- Because that's what I would do.

01:52:03.655 --> 01:52:06.623
Well, then we'll
be ready for him, sir.

01:52:10.376 --> 01:52:12.343
Send the guards home.

01:52:12.378 --> 01:52:16.214
- B-But, sir...
- I was raised in the Bronx, Wesley.

01:52:16.249 --> 01:52:18.716
This is something
you wouldn't understand.

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:23.220
Yes, sir.

01:52:31.852 --> 01:52:34.625
- I have to talk to you.
- Give me a break, Urich.

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:37.364
- Doors are open, Detective.
- Terrific. Just in time.

01:52:37.399 --> 01:52:40.317
- Freddy, keep those people back!
- You're gonna wanna hear this.

01:52:40.352 --> 01:52:42.868
I just got an anonymous tip
on the Tazio murder.

01:52:42.903 --> 01:52:45.613
Phone it into the station.
I got much bigger problems tonight.

01:52:45.648 --> 01:52:48.289
It leads to Wilson Fisk.

01:52:48.324 --> 01:52:51.034
Nick, he's the Kingpin
and I can prove it.

01:52:51.069 --> 01:52:54.242
Come on.
You got nothin' on Fisk.

01:52:54.277 --> 01:52:57.415
No, but I got the guy
that does.

01:52:59.667 --> 01:53:02.294
Would you care
for another martini, sir?

01:53:02.329 --> 01:53:04.921
No, I come here
for the view, asshole.

01:53:06.672 --> 01:53:09.800
- Wesley Owen Welch?
- Who wants to know?

01:53:09.835 --> 01:53:12.141
Detective Nick Manolis.

01:53:12.176 --> 01:53:15.430
I'd like to talk to you
about the murder of Lisa Tazio.

01:53:15.465 --> 01:53:17.563
I want my lawyer.

01:53:17.598 --> 01:53:19.933
I haven't charged you
with anything.

01:53:20.017 --> 01:53:22.602
I won't talk to you
without my lawyer present.

01:53:24.103 --> 01:53:27.279
All right, then I'll talk,
you listen...

01:53:27.314 --> 01:53:30.358
and then we can
talk about your plea bargain.

01:53:35.654 --> 01:53:37.740
Check.

01:54:23.402 --> 01:54:25.737
Daredevil.

01:54:25.772 --> 01:54:28.073
Kingpin.

01:55:32.209 --> 01:55:34.176
Mmm.

01:55:34.211 --> 01:55:36.796
It's a shame
you came here wounded.

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:41.049
I would have loved to
fight you in your prime.

01:55:43.051 --> 01:55:46.304
They call you
the man without fear.

01:55:47.722 --> 01:55:52.226
If that's true, why are you afraid
to show your face?

01:55:54.394 --> 01:55:57.314
I don't believe it.

01:55:57.349 --> 01:56:00.030
No. No. No.

01:56:00.065 --> 01:56:03.901
The blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen?

01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:08.990
You killed the only two people
I ever loved.

01:56:09.948 --> 01:56:12.034
Why?

01:56:14.119 --> 01:56:16.585
Business.

01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:19.435
It's all it ever is,
is business.

01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:22.215
I was working for Fallon
at the time.

01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:24.836
Your father was supposed
to throw a fight.

01:56:24.871 --> 01:56:26.755
And your girl...

01:56:26.837 --> 01:56:32.051
was in the wrong family
at the wrong time.

01:56:32.086 --> 01:56:34.570
It's all business.

01:56:34.605 --> 01:56:37.020
I'll find you.

01:56:37.055 --> 01:56:40.390
And you've been in
my business for too long.

01:57:40.148 --> 01:57:44.485
I've been thinking about this day
since I was 12 years old.

01:58:12.133 --> 01:58:14.343
I don't understand.

01:58:20.598 --> 01:58:23.148
I'm not the bad guy.

01:58:23.183 --> 01:58:28.104
You hear that, blind man?

01:58:28.139 --> 01:58:31.155
Sirens.

01:58:31.190 --> 01:58:33.191
They're coming for you.

01:58:33.226 --> 01:58:36.076
For me?

01:58:36.111 --> 01:58:40.329
Didn't you hear?
The word's out on the Kingpin.

01:58:40.364 --> 01:58:44.784
They're coming for you.
I can hear the police radios from here.

01:58:44.819 --> 01:58:49.789
No. No. I swear, I'll tell them
who you are.

01:58:49.824 --> 01:58:51.714
Yeah? Go ahead.

01:58:51.749 --> 01:58:57.462
Tell 'em. Tell the guys at Rikers
all about how you got beat by a blind man.

01:58:59.047 --> 01:59:01.305
It'll be like
blood in the water.

01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:06.637
Oh. Don't worry about that.
'Cause I'll get out.

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.638
Yeah. I know.

01:59:10.931 --> 01:59:13.308
And I'll be waiting.

01:59:16.770 --> 01:59:18.729
Justice is served.

01:59:26.653 --> 01:59:29.488
I'll get you.

01:59:29.523 --> 01:59:32.289
I'll get you.

01:59:32.324 --> 01:59:36.077
It's not over with yet.

01:59:36.112 --> 01:59:39.830
It's not over with yet.

01:59:51.924 --> 01:59:54.092
This is for you, Dad.

02:00:15.443 --> 02:00:20.030
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Mr. Murdock.
I appreciate everything.

02:00:20.065 --> 02:00:22.115
- Seriously, congratulations.
- You the man.

02:00:22.150 --> 02:00:24.534
All right. Yeah.
Keep it real.

02:00:24.569 --> 02:00:26.584
I appreciate
everything.

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:30.706
I'm feelin' you, man.
You ever need anything,
come down to 117 th Street.

02:00:30.741 --> 02:00:33.339
I'll do that.
Thank you.

02:00:33.374 --> 02:00:34.896
- That's it, dog.
- You stuck by me.

02:00:34.931 --> 02:00:36.384
- That's it, dog.
- You stuck by me.

02:00:36.419 --> 02:00:40.297
Nobody wouldn't touch me
with a 20,000 foot pole.

02:00:40.332 --> 02:00:42.639
- Oh.
- All right.

02:00:42.674 --> 02:00:45.947
I could cry right now.
You're like a brother to me, man.

02:00:45.982 --> 02:00:49.186
"Police say that although
there were no eyewitnesses...

02:00:49.221 --> 02:00:52.056
they suspect Daredevil
was the one to bring Fisk to justice."

02:00:52.091 --> 02:00:54.409
Did you hear that?
There were no eyewitnesses.

02:00:54.444 --> 02:00:56.692
It's in black and white.
How can you be a skeptic?

02:00:56.727 --> 02:00:59.771
If there's no eyewitness...
I mean, you know, Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.

02:00:59.806 --> 02:01:02.113
- Oh, please.
- The alligators in the sewers.

02:01:02.148 --> 02:01:04.296
So you're saying there are
alligators in the sewers?

02:01:04.331 --> 02:01:06.409
- No.
- You're changing your position on this one.

02:01:06.444 --> 02:01:09.988
Do you or do you not concede
that there are alligators in the sewers?

02:01:10.023 --> 02:01:11.955
Please answer the question.

02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:15.826
- No, I don't...
- How can you not concede? You won't...

02:01:18.537 --> 02:01:21.456
Judy, we're over here!

02:01:28.128 --> 02:01:30.088
How you doin'?

02:01:31.756 --> 02:01:35.217
- I'm doin' okay. I'll be all right.
- You want to talk about it?

02:01:35.252 --> 02:01:38.345
No. But thanks.

02:01:41.889 --> 02:01:45.100
- I'm gonna get some air.
- I got it.

02:01:45.135 --> 02:01:47.602
Thanks.

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:08.161
Good to see you.

02:02:08.286 --> 02:02:10.537
Nice to see you.
Thank you very much.

02:02:11.705 --> 02:02:13.707
Bueno. See you next week.

02:02:20.129 --> 02:02:22.130
Well, maybe next week,
Matt, huh?

02:02:22.165 --> 02:02:26.218
Maybe.

02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:38.061
- Matt.
- Ben.

02:02:40.145 --> 02:02:43.399
Promised my kids I'd quit.
Gum's gonna kill me quicker.

02:02:45.275 --> 02:02:49.299
- How are you?
- I'm all right. I'm good.

02:02:49.334 --> 02:02:53.163
- Thank you.
- Well, don't thank me so quick.

02:02:53.198 --> 02:02:56.742
You see there's this other
story I been workin' on.

02:02:56.826 --> 02:02:59.453
I wanted to tell you about it
before it hit the paper.

02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:03.206
I know the truth
about Daredevil.

02:03:03.331 --> 02:03:06.751
Justice is blind.

02:03:08.919 --> 02:03:13.631
Ben,
if you run that story...

02:03:13.666 --> 02:03:15.842
I'm finished.

02:03:21.138 --> 02:03:24.182
But I'm a reporter, kid.

02:03:24.266 --> 02:03:26.976
It's what I do.

02:03:32.522 --> 02:03:34.900
Violence doesn't discriminate.

02:03:34.935 --> 02:03:37.943
It hits all of us...

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:44.163
rich, poor, healthy, sick.

02:03:44.198 --> 02:03:50.120
It comes as cold and bracing
as a winter breeze off the Hudson.

02:03:50.155 --> 02:03:53.337
Until it sinks
into your bones...

02:03:53.372 --> 02:03:56.375
leaving you with a chill
you can't shake.

02:04:09.303 --> 02:04:13.139
They say there's no rest for the wicked.

02:04:13.174 --> 02:04:16.059
But what about the good?

02:04:18.685 --> 02:04:21.896
The battle of good
versus evil is never-ending...

02:04:26.067 --> 02:04:29.075
because evil always survives...

02:04:29.110 --> 02:04:33.906
- Bull's-eye.
- With the help of evil men.

02:05:13.106 --> 02:05:15.816
Braille.

02:05:45.299 --> 02:05:48.759
As for Daredevil, well...

02:05:50.011 --> 02:05:52.638
soon the world
will know the truth...

02:05:58.643 --> 02:06:02.730
that this is a city
born ofheroes...

02:06:03.647 --> 02:06:06.566
that one man
can make a difference.

02:06:25.582 --> 02:06:27.542
Go get 'em, Matt.

02:06:28.792 --> 02:06:31.135
Hell's Kitchen is my neighborhood.

02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:34.756
I prowl the rooftops
and alleyways at night...

02:06:34.791 --> 02:06:36.507
watching from the darkness.

02:06:36.591 --> 02:06:39.010
Forever in darkness.

02:06:42.137 --> 02:06:44.223
A guardian devil.

02:06:45.305 --> 02:06:51.915
