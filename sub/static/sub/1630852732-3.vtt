00:12.387 --> 00:13.304
Dion!

00:14.431 --> 00:15.557
Dion!

00:16.516 --> 00:17.475
Dion!

00:18.143 --> 00:19.894
-Huh?
-You coming?

00:19.978 --> 00:22.022
-In a minute.
-The bell's about to ring.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.690
-I'm waiting for someone.
-Dion.

00:25.150 --> 00:25.984
Oh, hey.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.903
We can't really talk out here. Come on.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.326
So, you're a telepath?

00:35.410 --> 00:36.453
A mind prober.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.622
I have so many questions.
I don't know which one to ask first.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.333
You don't have to ask.
You can just think them if you want.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.711
<i>Can you hear my thoughts right now?</i>

00:44.794 --> 00:46.921
Yes, and you don't have
to touch your head.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.717
So you can read thoughts
<i>and</i> make yourself appear in my mind?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.177
That's awesome!

00:52.260 --> 00:53.928
I can also make people do things.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.972
Can you make <i>me </i>do things?

00:56.514 --> 00:59.100
I've been trying to make you
stop talking this whole time.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.687
-I don't think it works on Powered people.
-That's good.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.898
-Got a superhero name?
-No.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.525
Dude, what are you doing? You need a name.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.320
-Mine's Mind Mover because--
-You can move things with your mind.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.362
Exactly.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.282
I've been working on my costume design.
I could show you sometime.

01:15.283 --> 01:20.080
Can you guess what I'm thinking now?
Twix bars. Cookies & Creme minis.

01:20.163 --> 01:20.997
Whoa.

01:21.539 --> 01:25.085
All right. Look, promise me
you won't tell anyone about my powers.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.879
Not your mom
or the nerd squad you hang with.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.507
Nerd squad? We're the Triangle of Justice.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.883
They're my best friends.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.552
We could use a Jedi like you.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.472
I'm no Jedi. The Sith are way cooler.

01:37.555 --> 01:41.059
-Dude, the Sith are the bad guys.
-Bad guys get all the best lines.

01:42.227 --> 01:45.063
"I find your lack of faith disturbing."

01:45.772 --> 01:48.024
"They call me Mr. Glass."

01:48.108 --> 01:52.362
"You merely adopted the dark.
I was born in it."

01:55.573 --> 01:58.034
Villains are… kind of cool.

01:59.953 --> 02:04.124
I wish we could hang out
longer, but we gotta get to class.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.375
We can do both.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.918
What does that mean?

02:07.001 --> 02:07.836
You'll see.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.850
Look at this.
All of a sudden, it's spiking.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.434
What?

03:55.693 --> 03:56.527
Work?

03:58.071 --> 03:58.905
It's Tevin.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.199
Why are you still giving
that man the Heisman?

04:01.699 --> 04:05.203
How is that conversation gonna go?
"Hey, sorry I couldn't chat with you."

04:05.286 --> 04:09.249
"Pat, Dion's homicidal former trainer,
who I thought we killed two years ago,

04:09.332 --> 04:11.292
is locked up in a cage at BIONA."

04:11.793 --> 04:12.919
"Facepalm emoji."

04:13.002 --> 04:15.338
I would probably go
with the mind blown emoji.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.007
I can't do that to Dion.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.970
I can't have him
reliving the Pat trauma all over again.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.473
Seems like you're the one
who doesn't wanna do the reliving.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.517
What's that supposed to mean?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.561
It means that you have issues
with Powered men.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.856
If that smooth-skinned brother
wasn't Powered, you'd be texting him back.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.566
-Tell me I'm wrong.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.945
Dion isn't the same kid
he was two years ago.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.740
Back then, he was a kid
dealing with the loss of his father,

04:42.824 --> 04:44.826
trying to find his way
in a new neighborhood,

04:44.909 --> 04:46.369
new school, new friends.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.872
He has come through that
a brave, sensitive young man.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.833
He's growing up.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.335
You need to trust him.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.588
Are… Are you listening to me?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.095
Girl, quit wasting that gym body

05:04.178 --> 05:07.181
and go make out
with that fine brother to some '90s R & B.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.270
Nicole Warren, answer the damn phone.

05:19.027 --> 05:19.861
Hey.

05:21.362 --> 05:22.322
I'm at Rico's.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.826
-He got jokes?

05:28.286 --> 05:29.162
Um…

05:29.912 --> 05:32.749
Uh, yeah, I don't have work
for a little bit. I'll be here.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.666
She sure will.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.377
Yeah. Great. See you soon.

05:40.256 --> 05:44.510
-Will you wipe that smile off your face?
-What? This is my face.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.473
That dancing is the most working out
you've done all day.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.394
Here you go.

05:53.478 --> 05:57.398
So the only thing
you saw down there were flowers?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.817
Yeah, but they were weird flowers.
They lit up.

06:00.401 --> 06:03.279
That was probably
just the sun hitting them.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.240
Esperanza, there's no sun underground.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.035
Did you get any proof? Photos?

06:09.577 --> 06:12.455
I got way too freaked out and left,
but I drew a picture.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.127
It has a face!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.670
Come on, Dion.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.807
What's your deal?
Is Brayden your new BFF or what?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.267
No! We just have some stuff to talk about.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.019
-What kind of stuff?
-"Stuff" stuff.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.104
Okay, class.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.900
All of you received your quizzes back,
all of you that are here.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.276
<i>Dion.</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:44.570
A few of you
even actually got 100%.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.322
<i>Still want to hang out?</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:49.033
<i>Yeah, but we're in class.</i>

06:49.700 --> 06:51.035
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

06:57.875 --> 06:59.127
<i>Now, open them.</i>

07:02.839 --> 07:03.673
Whoa.

07:05.049 --> 07:08.761
How did we get all the way out here?
This place goes on forever.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.013
Dude, did you just teleport us here?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.516
This is a place I like to go in my mind.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.102
So we're in your head right now?

07:18.312 --> 07:19.814
Can I use my powers?

07:19.897 --> 07:21.232
-Yeah.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.280
Yeah!

07:28.239 --> 07:29.282
This is awesome!

07:29.991 --> 07:33.369
You do something.
You know, besides talk in my head.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.163
Like this?

07:35.246 --> 07:37.123
Wha-- Whoa.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.875
W-Which one's the real you?

07:40.042 --> 07:43.004
-What do you think?
-I don't know. That one?

07:45.381 --> 07:46.924
How about this one?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.343
Whoa. This is so weird.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.138
-How do you do that?
-I put an idea inside your head.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.973
And if you believe it,
that's what you see.

07:54.056 --> 07:57.143
So you can't make me do things,
but you can make me see things.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.644
Brayden!

07:58.728 --> 08:00.855
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.565
Who's that?

08:02.648 --> 08:03.566
Brayden.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.026
Come on, I'll show you.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.374
Brayden?

08:24.670 --> 08:27.048
Where's my baby?

08:27.131 --> 08:29.967
Where in the world could he be?

08:33.888 --> 08:35.806
I'm gonna get ya. Gotcha!

08:39.310 --> 08:40.144
Is that you?

08:42.146 --> 08:45.149
Yup. And my mom. That's my dad.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.195
What is this place?

08:49.278 --> 08:52.990
Home. I try to come here
and watch them whenever I can.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.909
Why don't you live here anymore?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.703
They died. So I had to move.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.166
Are you all right?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.887
-Your dad had powers?
-That's who I got them from.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.766
My dad had powers too.
Uh, he got 'em on a trip up to Iceland.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.101
So did mine.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.520
Dude, do you think they knew each other?

09:22.603 --> 09:23.437
Mm-mm.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.108
<i>Evil child</i>.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.569
-Wait.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.653
What's happening?

09:31.571 --> 09:35.074
-Uh, c-come on. Let's… Let's go.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.302
What's that?

09:54.385 --> 09:56.679
Never mind. Don't look at it.

09:57.305 --> 10:01.892
-Evil child. You brought the devil here.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.770
No!

10:11.152 --> 10:12.653
Are we ready to get started?

10:15.615 --> 10:16.449
Yeah.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.078
The question was, which of
the following colonies was settled first?

10:27.918 --> 10:30.212
Whoever it is you're envisioning
kicking that bag,

10:30.296 --> 10:31.505
I'm pretty sure they're dead.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.174
I wish.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.260
Thanks for seeing me.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.305
I was hoping
I hadn't heard the last from you.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.184
I'm sorry about the way I left
the other day.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.020
-I just--
-You don't have to explain anything to me.

10:46.896 --> 10:51.942
You're a single parent,
raising a little boy with superpowers.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.987
I can't imagine what that's like.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.281
Well…

10:59.659 --> 11:01.035
let me paint you a picture.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.288
Dion thinks he can do anything.

11:04.372 --> 11:10.044
So, when he walks out into the world,
all he sees is adventure and possibility.

11:10.127 --> 11:13.589
And all I see
is everything that could go wrong.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.968
I'm constantly searching the horizon,
looking for what's coming next,

11:18.052 --> 11:22.139
and every time he walks out the door,
I know he's in danger.

11:23.265 --> 11:26.310
And you think it's on you
to be everywhere at all times.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.688
I'm gonna do everything I can
to protect him.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.447
When I was little,
I remember playing outside my building.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.616
We were looked after

11:41.200 --> 11:43.828
by aunts or grandparents.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.539
Maybe even people from my neighborhood.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.457
My community raised me.

11:50.084 --> 11:53.587
My point is… is that
sometimes it takes a village.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.049
I'm all for villages.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.802
Just not Powered villages.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.222
Yeah.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.558
No, you have every right to be careful.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.645
I hope I can earn your trust.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.022
I'm sure gonna try.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.068
Because whoever it was that hurt you,
it isn't me.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.574
I could hurt you, though.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.284
You know what, you wanna go?

12:23.367 --> 12:24.702
No, I saw you kick. I'm good.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.839
We got the test results back on Pat.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.091
-And?
-Negative.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.051
He's clean.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.096
Run it again.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.306
There's nothing there.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.392
I-I think the guy is really here to help.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.853
You don't know him.

12:51.979 --> 12:56.358
That stupid grin.
That whole golly gee, puppy dog thing.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.818
That's his mask.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.739
When a tiger flashes its teeth,
don't mistake that for a smile.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.535
I seem to remember you having
a similar reaction to me

13:06.619 --> 13:07.703
when we first met.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.831
Charming people make me nervous.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.999
You're charming.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.632
The moment Pat gets out of line,
I'll pump him with enough CO2

13:19.715 --> 13:22.301
to turn him into Jack Nicholson
at the end of <i>The Shining.</i>

13:22.384 --> 13:24.512
I have a call with doctors from Oslo.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.429
David.

13:26.013 --> 13:26.972
Yes?

13:27.056 --> 13:28.057
Run it again.

13:30.100 --> 13:30.935
Will do.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.035
I got you something.
Straight from Hi-Ho Comics on 3rd.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.002
You really should
be putting these in plastic.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.463
The value dropped
right when you left the store.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.590
No Mark Waid?

14:02.716 --> 14:05.553
I told the guy at the store
I'm shopping for a comic book geek.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.680
I prefer the term "aficionado<i>.</i>"

14:08.931 --> 14:12.351
Whenever a guy like you
calls a guy like me a geek or a nerd,

14:12.434 --> 14:14.061
it's never a term of endearment.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.647
I didn't mean to insult you.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.901
The truth is it was
a weak attempt to gain your trust.

14:21.402 --> 14:25.281
Well, then you will need to do better
than a 12-dollar comic.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.994
I've done a deep dive into your life.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.789
Read every Reddit post,
every Facebook update.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.959
I know people questioned
how the great Mark Warren

14:37.042 --> 14:38.627
could be friends with you, but I get it.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.212
You're likable.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.006
Go on.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.593
You've built up
quite the résumé over the years.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.972
Your ex-girlfriend, Kerry Phillips,
Dr. Morton Lungstad--

14:50.055 --> 14:51.724
-Stop.
-Charlotte Tuck, Jill Noonan.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.476
-Walter Mills, Mark Warren.
-Why are you here?

14:55.144 --> 14:58.188
After all that death,
you surrendered of your own volition.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.859
You were dead to the world. Anyone else
would have moved away, started over.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.655
Can't get enough of that Gucci Mane.
Trap music for life.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.118
I believe you came home to help.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.122
Even if it means being locked in a cage
for the rest of your life.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.542
That choice must have come
from a profound change in character.

15:19.835 --> 15:23.339
-I think you're ready to become the hero.
-No. I'm no… I'm no hero.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.550
I'm not much of, uh, anything.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.136
The earth disagrees.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.640
This is the soil from the sinkhole.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.394
The tests we ran
show that you're still charged.

15:38.812 --> 15:39.647
Uh,

15:40.147 --> 15:43.233
that can't be right.
I've been powerless for over two years.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.569
The Crooked Man is part of your DNA.
It's who you are.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.695
It'll always be inside you.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.618
I'm still Powered?

15:54.328 --> 15:57.164
It's not enough juice to help you
win an arm wrestling contest.

15:57.873 --> 16:01.502
It's enough to make you a valuable asset
in our research at the sinkhole.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.338
Things will get worse. You know that.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.549
We need to diagnose
what's happening down there and stop it.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.135
You wanted to help? Now's your chance.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.846
Uh, what-whatever you need.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.975
Um, Suzanne, is she on board with this?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.851
With me?

16:17.935 --> 16:20.229
I told her your tests came back negative.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.024
So you lied. Um…

16:25.484 --> 16:28.362
Do you know what she'll do to us
if she finds out? Or to me?

16:28.862 --> 16:31.365
She will ship me to Siberia.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.368
Where am I gonna find trap music
in Siberia? It's a very small scene there.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.287
The lie was essential.
Plausible deniability.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.790
It keeps Suzanne clean
and BIONA functioning.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.710
We can solve this problem together
without involving her.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.132
The question I have for you is,
do you still want to help?

16:51.468 --> 16:52.302
Yeah, I do.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.681
Then let's get you out of here.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.127
Are you okay?
That was like a horror movie or something.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.462
What was that?

17:27.087 --> 17:29.423
My aunt. She was awful.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.842
But we were in your head.

17:32.342 --> 17:36.055
You can think about anything you want.
Why would you be thinking about her?

17:37.973 --> 17:39.850
I, um…

17:39.933 --> 17:40.851
I saw her die.

17:41.935 --> 17:42.770
Whoa.

17:44.188 --> 17:47.357
It was bad. I try to keep her out,
but sometimes I can't.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.068
She can't hurt you.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.196
-Next time I'll try--
-Okay, hold on. Next time?

17:52.279 --> 17:54.656
No way. I'm gonna stay out of your head.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.994
Come on. Let's do something else.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.412
I gotta support Esperanza.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.123
Why? 'Cause she's
in your Triangle of Justice?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.416
Because she's my friend.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.419
-This is lame.
-Brayden!

18:22.017 --> 18:24.019
So how are you feeling?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.773
-I don't want to do this.
-What?

18:28.482 --> 18:30.234
You're the reason we're here.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.778
-Exactly.
-I… made a mistake.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.822
You didn't make a mistake.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.783
You're the best singer I know,
and you love it.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.576
Everyone's here. You can't miss your shot.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.870
Did I just get <i>Hamilton</i>'d?

18:41.954 --> 18:45.332
-That's besides the point.
-The TOJ is here for you. So please.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.672
Welcome to the auditions.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.258
I will be your director.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.343
But I will also be your mentor,

18:56.426 --> 18:59.054
your… inspiration.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.183
I will not stand for any prima donnas.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.769
This is the beginning of your lives.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.980
Actually, it's the beginning
of fourth period.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.066
Be careful. This is my world.
You're auditioning to be in it.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.944
You got big dreams.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.571
You want fame?

19:16.238 --> 19:19.783
Well, fame costs.
And right here is where you start paying.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.326
In sweat.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.579
Jesus, take the wheel.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.416
-Oh, Jesus won't save you, my dear.
-Isn't that what Jesus does?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.626
I have been given
the responsibility of deciding

19:29.710 --> 19:31.795
which music will make it into the revue.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.257
So get out there and sell it.
I want to see passion.

19:35.757 --> 19:41.388
I want your blood,
sweat and tears on this stage.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.390
And I promise

19:44.224 --> 19:47.603
I will make you a star!

19:58.530 --> 19:59.364
Line?

19:59.448 --> 20:00.282
Next.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.785
"Oh, Susanna."

20:19.635 --> 20:21.220
-Next?
-Next.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.643
Fosse, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.623
I really hate this song.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.209
Next!

20:53.168 --> 20:55.170
-Mr. Kwame?
-Huh?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.130
There is no doubt this stage is filled

20:57.214 --> 21:00.259
with the best
McKoy Park Elementary has to offer.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.345
But there's one thing
that puts your show over the top.

21:04.388 --> 21:08.767
Imagine, pyrotechnics, flames
shooting from both sides of the stage<i>.</i>

21:08.850 --> 21:11.770
And for the finale, confetti cannons.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.565
This is a video I took
at Josie's quinceañera.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.151
I think the quality of my work
speaks for itself.

21:21.947 --> 21:22.864
Oh, oh.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.034
You just got yourself a stage manager.

21:28.954 --> 21:29.871
Next!

21:36.253 --> 21:39.715
This feels like we're smack
in the middle of a very bad idea.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.759
If there's a spike in energy,
the cooling vest will extinguish it.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.268
Your temperature is rising.
Are you feeling anything?

21:51.351 --> 21:55.272
Yeah, I'm feeling lots of things.
Mainly remorse, shame.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.859
Also, the guy with the CO2 weapon
pointed at my back

21:58.942 --> 22:00.193
isn't exactly comforting.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.080
I tried to kill everything I loved here.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.711
The look on Dion's face,
the fear in his eyes…

22:18.962 --> 22:23.216
This energy inside me,
this hunger, I just had to feed it.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.094
That was the only way
to make it stop and then, uh,

22:27.679 --> 22:28.930
I felt like a god.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.435
It's… It's terrible, but

22:34.478 --> 22:35.312
it's true.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.815
It erased me
and made me into something else.

22:40.817 --> 22:41.651
Okay.

22:43.945 --> 22:44.946
Oh.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.700
-I feel it.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.162
-What do you feel?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.417
Like a rush of

22:58.710 --> 22:59.544
hate.

23:00.921 --> 23:04.549
Just blind anger that's been
held down here for a long time.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.385
What is it? Is it the Crooked Energy?

23:06.885 --> 23:09.012
No, no, but the Crooked Energy
is using it.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.932
It brought it up to the surface
and let it out.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.271
Yeah, it's not hiding anymore.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.117
Where the hell is Pat Rollins?

23:30.200 --> 23:32.911
I want a full lockdown.
Get him back in his cage. Move!

23:33.912 --> 23:37.249
Nicole, I have news. It's Pat.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.637
What were you and Brayden talking about?

23:50.720 --> 23:51.555
Nothing.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.515
It didn't look like nothing.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.851
Can we talk after your audition?

23:55.934 --> 23:58.770
You're supposed to be
taking my mind off of being scared.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.481
By the way, you're doing a terrible job.

24:01.565 --> 24:05.402
You're the best singer in school.
Okay, you're way better than us.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.781
-Absolutely. You got this.
-Esperanza Jiménez.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.700
-Come on.
-Let's do it.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.201
TOJ!

24:45.942 --> 24:47.152
Next!

24:48.737 --> 24:50.071
You can't "next" her.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.200
-She didn't sing her song.
-Child, what are you doing on my stage?

24:53.283 --> 24:54.784
It's okay, Dion.

24:56.161 --> 24:59.289
Mr. Kwame, when you were a dancer,
you never messed up?

24:59.372 --> 25:01.082
That is how I remember it.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.753
Esperanza worked really hard on her song,
and she's really, really good.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.129
Give her a chance.

25:14.930 --> 25:15.805
You got this.

25:18.058 --> 25:18.892
Okay.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.024
<i>He's here.</i>

26:20.620 --> 26:23.915
-<i> How long do I have to stay here?</i>
-<i>Do you have somewhere to be?</i>

26:25.125 --> 26:27.752
<i>Just anywhere but here. This is painful.</i>

26:28.753 --> 26:30.046
<i>Pat, you can handle it.</i>

26:32.257 --> 26:36.094
<i>This is the spot where Dion</i>
<i>was standing when I tried to kill him.</i>

26:36.177 --> 26:37.971
<i>Will Dion ever forgive me?</i>

26:44.352 --> 26:45.520
I need to talk to you.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.148
In a minute.

26:49.232 --> 26:52.277
-Hey, the auditions are almost over!

26:52.360 --> 26:55.155
-Who's Pat?
How do you know that name?

26:55.947 --> 26:59.868
He's here. At the sinkhole.
And he's thinking about you.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.760
Look at you. You're so tall.

27:17.844 --> 27:20.013
I can't call you "little man" anymore.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.014
You died.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.557
I saw you die!

27:22.641 --> 27:23.767
Okay, so,

27:24.976 --> 27:26.144
not exactly.

27:26.227 --> 27:29.481
I know seeing me has got to be like,
"Whoa, dude's supposed to be dead,"

27:29.564 --> 27:33.777
but, see, the-the bad part of me,
the-the Crooked Energy, that's, um…

27:34.402 --> 27:35.362
That's…

27:36.071 --> 27:38.198
It doesn't control me anymore.
So I'm… I'm me again!

27:38.281 --> 27:41.409
It-It's like, um, um…

27:41.493 --> 27:44.621
Zemo. Baron Zemo and the Thunderbolts.
You love the Thunderbolts.

27:44.704 --> 27:47.290
Remember how they were villains
pretending to be heroes,

27:47.374 --> 27:49.793
but they actually became heroes?
That's me. I'm Baron Zemo.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.503
I'm a reformed villain. I'm a good guy.

27:51.586 --> 27:52.796
-Di!
-Stop talking!

27:52.879 --> 27:54.798
Hey, Di, hey, look at me.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.007
I didn't hurt him.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.967
You stay away from us!

27:59.302 --> 28:00.345
Dion, talk to me.

28:00.428 --> 28:02.847
Okay, I know this must feel
like a really bad dream.

28:02.931 --> 28:06.059
What do we do when we have bad dreams?
We work through it together.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.644
This isn't a bad dream!

28:08.186 --> 28:09.104
He's alive!

28:10.605 --> 28:11.606
-Come here.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.317
-What were you thinking?
-I had it all under control.

28:14.818 --> 28:18.321
Put that thing back in its cell
and be in my office first thing.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.739
-Suzanne--
-Just do it!

28:19.823 --> 28:22.367
Something else is down there, Suzanne!

28:22.450 --> 28:25.161
You swore to me
he would never leave that cell.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.497
-I had no idea.
-You knew?

28:29.791 --> 28:30.959
I--

28:31.042 --> 28:32.669
You knew and you didn't tell me?

28:35.046 --> 28:38.258
I'm sorry. Yes, I knew about it
and I should have told you.

28:38.341 --> 28:41.136
You're not sorry. You just got caught.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.148
She, uh, she took my comics.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.400
All of them. Gone.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.903
You just had to lie to the CEO of BIONA.

29:39.986 --> 29:40.987
Storms pass.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.365
You should know better than anyone.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.159
Right, 'cause I'm…

29:46.743 --> 29:48.286
We just have to ride it out.

29:49.037 --> 29:53.166
No, see, y-you… You knew exactly what
you were doing when you lied to Suzanne.

29:53.750 --> 29:57.420
There are powerful people who aren't happy
about how much money BIONA's bleeding.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.506
They'd like to see some returns.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.466
So you lied to the boss!

30:01.549 --> 30:03.051
I took action.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.970
And as a result, we found
valuable information at the sinkhole.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.556
The surge of electricity.
You're not causing the spikes.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.309
Someone or something is.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.813
In time, Suzanne will appreciate that.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.191
Great. So where does that leave me?

30:21.402 --> 30:23.363
I'll try to get you some new comic books.

30:25.073 --> 30:25.949
Oh.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.470
You have every right to be mad.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.394
I messed up.
I should've told you about Pat.

30:58.773 --> 31:03.778
Sometimes, I try so hard to protect you,
I-I end up doing the opposite.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.782
But, if Pat's alive,

31:08.867 --> 31:11.202
does that mean that Dad is too?

31:12.620 --> 31:16.916
I think if Dad were here,
he would have come home to us.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.755
But he said energy never dies.

31:23.590 --> 31:24.424
It doesn't.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.844
Your dad is all around us.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.638
I see him in you.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.933
He's everywhere that we remember him.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.854
We won't always get answers,

31:39.439 --> 31:42.817
but we can keep him in our hearts,

31:43.651 --> 31:44.861
and keep moving forward.

31:46.404 --> 31:47.614
It's part of growing up.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.754
We've got an uptick on the NRMs.
I'm thinking it's fault line stress.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.173
I could check
with the US Geological Survey.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.216
It could be activity
at the Brevard Fault Line.

32:07.717 --> 32:11.137
Georgia hasn't had
a significant earthquake since 1916.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.397
I'm really not in the mood
to talk right now.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.857
Yeah, that makes two of us.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.068
But there's something
going on in the sinkhole.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.612
<i>It's spiking with energy.</i>
<i>Same way it did three days ago.</i>

32:28.196 --> 32:30.448
<i>I'd feel better</i>
<i>if you came down and saw this.</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:33.952
Pat was right. Something is down there.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.620
Have you thought maybe Pat's right,

32:35.703 --> 32:37.914
because he's the one
messing with the sinkhole?

32:37.997 --> 32:41.584
<i> That's not what the data's</i>
<i>telling us. Something is happening.</i>

32:41.668 --> 32:42.794
And I don't think it's Pat.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.546
Well, that something
is outside my kid's school,

32:45.630 --> 32:47.382
where you let Pat go,

32:47.465 --> 32:49.842
so why don't you
figure out what's going on

32:49.926 --> 32:52.095
and call me back when you know something.

32:53.763 --> 32:54.764
Preach, sis.

32:56.265 --> 32:57.266
What was that about?

32:59.936 --> 33:02.438
Ms. Suzanne wanted me
to go out to the sinkhole.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.607
Really? Great.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.236
Why is that great?

33:09.821 --> 33:10.655
Uh…

33:11.489 --> 33:12.865
Because…

33:14.075 --> 33:17.912
The sinkhole's interesting, and there's
some really cool things down there,

33:17.996 --> 33:20.999
um, like… history stuff.

33:21.582 --> 33:25.169
And maybe stuff
that Ms. Suzanne knows about.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.131
Is there something you want to tell me?

33:30.091 --> 33:32.218
Um…

33:32.927 --> 33:38.683
I might have teleported to BIONA
to find my phone, which I didn't lose,

33:39.267 --> 33:43.229
but then I heard Ms. Suzanne talking
about a weird secret down at the sinkhole.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.274
Then I went down there
and I saw these really weird flowers

33:46.357 --> 33:48.067
and they kind of came alive.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.611
And then Pat shows up there?
What the hell, Nic?

33:53.364 --> 33:55.867
-Can you watch Di for me?
-I got you.

33:55.950 --> 33:56.909
I'm sorry, Mom.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.704
We'll talk later.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.295
Have you ever watched <i>The Bachelor</i>?

34:21.142 --> 34:22.351
Okay, I'm here.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.979
Take me to this damn hole

34:25.063 --> 34:28.024
so I can put my son to bed
and feel like I did my job.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.400
Right this way.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.612
Suzanne, home base is on the line.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.238
I'll be right there.

34:48.169 --> 34:50.046
Pat, is that you down there?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.381
I want you to know I'm ready.

34:55.718 --> 34:56.636
Do you hear me?

34:59.013 --> 35:01.140
I'm ready for whatever
you want to throw at me.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.857
I'm not afraid of monsters!

35:20.576 --> 35:21.410
Nicole!

35:39.095 --> 35:39.929
Are you okay?

35:40.429 --> 35:42.223
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.224
Get the ladder!

35:44.475 --> 35:45.601
Ladder.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.396
Get Nicole out of that hole now!

36:43.910 --> 36:45.953
No!

36:52.210 --> 36:53.044
Here.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.594
Look out!

37:25.868 --> 37:27.328
We got a monster problem.
