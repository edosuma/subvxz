05:44.580 --> 05:47.572
They were the first people
to settle in Ireland.

05:48.420 --> 05:51.014
They had tremendous insight

05:51.220 --> 05:53.894
and hidden knowledge
of many things.

05:55.060 --> 05:56.733
They had knowledge

05:57.300 --> 05:58.973
of the future.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.419
They could speak the language
of the birds.

06:04.020 --> 06:08.617
They could see as the birds can see
from the sky above.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.532
They could look over the whole land.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.569
Sweeney -

06:16.340 --> 06:21.289
was cursed by St. Rénén because
he killed one of his clerics.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.290
From a vision he saw in the sky,

06:26.100 --> 06:29.730
he heard the noise of
the upcoming battle and fled.

06:31.380 --> 06:37.331
Part of the curse was that he could
not endure sharp sounds.

06:38.660 --> 06:42.016
He flew from the scene of battle
in a frenzy.

06:42.260 --> 06:45.571
He spent years
hopping from tree to tree

06:45.820 --> 06:49.176
for he couldn't set foot
on land again.

06:49.580 --> 06:53.653
And, like the birds,
he could never again trust humans.

06:56.860 --> 06:58.737
<i>Gloomy this life</i>

06:59.340 --> 07:01.411
<i>to be without a soft bed.</i>

07:02.300 --> 07:04.337
<i>Abode of cold frost.</i>

07:05.380 --> 07:07.610
<i>Roughness of wind driven snow.</i>

07:09.340 --> 07:10.933
<i>Cold, icy wind</i>

07:12.860 --> 07:15.500
<i>shadow of a feeble sun</i>

07:16.420 --> 07:18.650
<i>shelter from a single tree</i>

07:18.940 --> 07:21.295
<i>on the summit of a high plateau.</i>

09:29.180 --> 09:30.500
Very good.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.339
Good work.

10:01.540 --> 10:04.180
We'll do another bit tomorrow.

10:04.660 --> 10:05.660
NOW:

10:05.820 --> 10:08.494
You were all to learn a song
from home.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.653
Who will go first?

10:11.780 --> 10:13.100
Darach?

10:14.980 --> 10:16.175
Joseph.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.934
Come up and sing the song
you learned at home,

10:19.140 --> 10:20.175
good man.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.730
I know you're dying to sing for us.

10:29.940 --> 10:31.339
Stir yourself.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.251
Well done. Good boy.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.497
Didn't he sing well?

11:59.700 --> 12:01.498
Now, from now on,

12:01.740 --> 12:05.051
when you're singing,
open your mouth.

12:05.260 --> 12:06.489
Like this.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.179
Open wide.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.819
Very good.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.256
And sing out every note clearly.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.738
Imagine you had to get a hen's
egg into your mouth,

12:16.020 --> 12:17.419
open it up.

12:18.260 --> 12:20.092
Good man. Now, sit down.

12:55.220 --> 12:57.689
This one won't budge.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.456
Neither will this one.

13:11.140 --> 13:13.529
There are loads of periwinkles.

14:41.620 --> 14:42.940
Good lad.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.572
That's it.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.057
Throw it out quick.

16:38.020 --> 16:39.020
Good lad.

16:53.860 --> 16:55.055
Good man.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.098
Now, haul it in.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.774
Haul it in.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.013
That's it.

17:06.339 --> 17:08.694
Good man yourself - that's it.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.373
Use both hands.

17:17.020 --> 17:18.169
Good man.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.257
Do you have it?

17:22.099 --> 17:24.329
- Need a hand?
- Maybe.

17:24.579 --> 17:25.579
Hold on.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.173
That was good.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.536
Is it getting the better of you?

19:09.780 --> 19:11.578
I can't do it.

19:13.140 --> 19:14.892
Let's see now.

19:18.100 --> 19:21.616
Hold the potato like so...

19:23.740 --> 19:26.300
Place the potato between
your thumb

19:26.660 --> 19:28.697
and the knife like that.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.097
Hold it with two fingers,
either side,

19:31.340 --> 19:32.774
and cut through it
nice and easy.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.258
Don't do it too hard

19:37.100 --> 19:38.818
or it'll catch your thumb.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.570
See that?

19:41.420 --> 19:42.535
Good man.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.538
Let's see you try that.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.574
Don't be worried.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.693
It'll come with age, child.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.370
Nice and easy, in your own time.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.695
Mind the fingers.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.095
Good man yourself.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.369
Have you many left?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.898
A few.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.454
Joe!

21:49.940 --> 21:52.329
Hey Joe! Stop your carry-on!

21:53.340 --> 21:54.739
For God's sake!

24:34.540 --> 24:37.578
Isn't your father a fine singer?

24:38.020 --> 24:39.738
Would you sing me a song?

24:39.980 --> 24:41.891
I could record your voice
with this device.

24:42.140 --> 24:43.175
What do you say?

24:43.700 --> 24:45.657
I only sing at home.

24:46.460 --> 24:48.770
Isn't this your home?

24:52.700 --> 24:55.214
Which songs do you like anyway?

24:55.500 --> 24:57.138
I like “An tAmhrén Bréagach.”

24:57.340 --> 24:59.456
And “Amhrén Rinn Mhaoile.”

25:00.620 --> 25:02.497
“Amhrén Rinn Mhaoile”?

25:02.740 --> 25:05.732
That's quite a difficult song
for a young lad, isn't it?

25:06.660 --> 25:09.129
Do you know where they come from?

25:09.380 --> 25:10.973
My dad sings them

25:11.220 --> 25:13.052
and Calm an Bhlécaigh.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.771
And where did they get them?

25:17.060 --> 25:19.495
I suppose they go way back

25:20.140 --> 25:22.609
to the poets who wrote them
long ago

25:23.700 --> 25:25.418
but we still sing them.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.495
Now, what would you say to that!

31:47.180 --> 31:48.375
Here you are,

31:48.620 --> 31:50.372
you may as well...

31:53.500 --> 31:55.013
Here, finish it!

32:04.260 --> 32:06.729
May as well finish it!

32:07.020 --> 32:08.499
Throw it back, son.

32:14.980 --> 32:18.689
- We haven't another bottle?
- No!

34:29.739 --> 34:32.333
We're ready, Joe.

50:18.820 --> 50:21.175
Micheél Thaidhg bought
a new boat recently,

50:21.460 --> 50:22.460
a trawler.

50:24.940 --> 50:27.216
He'll do well around these parts.

50:33.940 --> 50:36.454
You might never come back, Joe.

50:37.180 --> 50:40.138
There's nothing left for me here.

50:41.780 --> 50:43.418
I don't know...

50:43.940 --> 50:46.090
I miss this place...

50:49.500 --> 50:52.174
You always had your eye on
the horizon.

52:17.820 --> 52:20.653
<i>I am the age of the Old Hag
of Beara.</i>

52:21.580 --> 52:23.969
<i>The age of Newgrange.</i>

52:24.900 --> 52:26.971
<i>The age of the Great Deer.</i>

52:28.700 --> 52:33.331
<i>I have two thousand years of that
stinking sow that was Ireland</i>

52:34.100 --> 52:36.057
<i>resonating in my ears</i>

52:36.860 --> 52:38.294
<i>in my mouth</i>

52:38.700 --> 52:40.213
<i>in my eyes</i>

52:40.700 --> 52:42.338
<i>in my head</i>

52:42.620 --> 52:43.620
<i>in my dreams.</i>

52:46.380 --> 52:50.613
<i>These horses, each with the
hammer and sickle on their flanks,</i>

52:51.180 --> 52:53.330
<i>they were the horses
of the Emir of Bokhara,</i>

52:53.580 --> 52:55.571
<i>they were the Golden Horde,</i>

52:55.780 --> 52:57.691
<i>Genghis Khan's cavalry.</i>

52:58.380 --> 53:01.657
<i>They were also the slender
brown horses</i>

53:01.900 --> 53:03.698
<i>in my father's and grandfathers
stories.</i>

53:04.780 --> 53:06.851
<i>And who truly knows
that they were not?</i>

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.419
Do you feel homesick here, Joe?

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.179
Sometimes.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.609
Sometimes not.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.497
Why do you feel homesick?

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.370
It's hard, leaving your native land
and forgetting it.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.737
Have you forgotten it?

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.455
That's not what I mean,
but forgetting the fun

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.531
and the people and the songs

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:37.257
the music and the festivities,
the races, things like that.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.614
I'm only here a little
under three years.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.214
But I was at the Newport Folk
Festival in 1966.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.773
But I must say now,
and back then too,

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.778
that the Clancy Brothers gave me
great help in getting those things.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.176
- When you started here?
- Yes, when I first started.

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.653
Well, we didn't know where he was.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.693
No, the first we'd heard about him,

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.295
I was at a Clancy Brothers' concert

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.855
and I used to hear Joe talking
about the Clancy Brothers

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.770
so, I made it a point to meet
one of them, which I did,

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.892
and asked if he knew Joe
and he said,

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:28.179
“Oh yes, very much so, actually he's
over in New York, we just left him

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:31.412
to come over here
and we're going back there.”

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.491
So, I said, “Will you tell him
his wife's dead

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.418
and to contact his children,”

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:37.531
which he didn't do.

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:06.896
You know that it's never too late,
Joe, to go back.

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.370
They might be happy to see you.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.975
I know that, I know that...

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:20.253
But I think that too much water
has passed under the bridge.

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.491
I went to England last year

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:28.458
and met my father.

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:33.493
I was going to write to tell you
but I changed my mind.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.979
I hadn't seen him since I was
five years old,

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.619
you know that.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.659
Myself and my grandmother went
over to search for him

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:45.732
and we finally found him.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.533
He was in London.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.890
He plays music himself
from time to time.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.091
Do you know what he said to me
when we found him?

01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.614
He said:

01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.538
“I always knew

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.572
that you'd find me.”

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.693
Do you know

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.890
in all the old stories

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:19.369
why it is that the warrior
always kills the beast?

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:22.335
I don't know.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:26.414
Because it is the warrior
who tells the story.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.212
How do you mean?

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.531
Sometimes I don't know

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.497
if I'm the warrior

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.493
or the beast.

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.374
<i>There were fish
in the rivers of Ireland.</i>

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.180
<i>There were animals
in her hollows.</i>

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:06.335
<i>Wild, shy, monstrous creatures
roamed her plains and forests.</i>

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:11.019
<i>Creatures that one could see
through and walk through.</i>

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:17.056
<i>We lived in ease and saw
new animals grow</i>

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.135
<i>the bear, the badger, the boar,
the deer and the wolf.</i>

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:32.456
<i>Then, sudden as a rising wind,
between night and morning,</i>

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.452
<i>there came a sickness</i>

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.693
<i>and on the seventh day, all of
the race of Parthalon were dead,</i>

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:44.295
<i>all except one single man.</i>

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:55.296
<i>"I am that man,” his companion
affirmed."</i>

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.053
<i>Tuan shaded his brow
with his hand</i>

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:04.137
<i>and he remembered back
through incredible ages</i>

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:06.536
<i>to the beginning of the world</i>

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.254
<i>and to the beginning of time
in Ireland.</i>

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.179
Listen, Méire.

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.814
I've a list of songs I haven't yet
recorded anywhere

01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:00.295
and I believe it would be good
to record them.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:14.375
Look, Méire, I have to find some
way out of this country.

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:20.337
I don't want to die
amongst strangers.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:26.096
There are fine people here,
but they are not my own people.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.138
If there was some way I could...

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:37.294
Maybe you could ask around
and see...

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:45.456
Look, Méire, I'd better go now.

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.290
There are people here waiting
to use the phone.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.210
We'll talk about it again.
Goodbye.

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:49.890
I haven't seen you here before.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.616
How long have you been here?

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.139
Seven years.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.099
That's a long time.

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.536
I would wait twice as long
for a poem.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.335
Have you caught good poems?

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.173
The poems I am fit for.

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:13.530
No person can get more than that

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:21.259
for a man's readiness is his limit.

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:28.576
It was foretold by a man
of knowledge

01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:33.769
that I should receive All Knowledge
by the bank of this river.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.453
And then?

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:39.813
And then,

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.170
I would have All Knowledge.

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:45.690
And after that?

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:49.414
What should there be after that?

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.813
I mean,

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:54.859
what would you do with
All Knowledge?

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.053
A question

01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.734
of great weight.

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:06.772
I could answer it if I had All
Knowledge, but not until then.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.455
What would you do, young man?

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:14.659
I would make a poem.

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.658
<i>I was born at night.</i>

01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:35.134
<i>That's why I was always so shy,
they said.</i>

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:41.500
<i>My mother told me stories.</i>

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.691
<i>My father taught me to sing.</i>

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.891
<i>And when I had grown</i>

01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:50.377
<i>and had listened to the
world's song,</i>

01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.614
<i>I felt that there could be
no greater happiness</i>

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.692
<i>than to return to that song.</i>

01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:01.490
<i>In song dwelled the most precious</i>

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:04.858
<i>and the most incomprehensible
dreams of mankind.</i>

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:10.339
<i>The mountains stretched into
the heavens in those days.</i>

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.330
<i>The songbirds of the air listened
in wonder to this song,</i>

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.249
<i>the most beautiful song in life.</i>

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:39.769
<i>Birds don't sing songs of glory.</i>

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:44.816
<i>Ice wrapped wings
That's my story</i>

01:28:45.305 --> 01:28:51.424
