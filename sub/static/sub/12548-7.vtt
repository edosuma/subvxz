WEBVTT

00:01.152 --> 00:04.448
I'm not going to annihilate
4.3 million Pakistanis

00:04.574 --> 00:07.429
without hearing from someone
whose authority I recognize.

00:07.545 --> 00:08.952
Our own people
tried to sink us?

00:09.089 --> 00:09.891
We have commandeered

00:10.011 --> 00:11.201
the NATO early warning station

00:11.331 --> 00:12.749
on the island of Sainte Marina.

00:12.866 --> 00:14.826
I am declaring
a 200-mile no-man's-land

00:14.971 --> 00:16.068
around this island.

00:16.221 --> 00:19.200
Test us, and we will all burn.

00:19.391 --> 00:20.794
You've been warned.

00:20.961 --> 00:22.025
_

00:22.094 --> 00:23.634
We're under attack.
We have been drugged.

00:23.742 --> 00:25.457
They told me, put their drug
in the water,

00:25.572 --> 00:26.438
and you would go to sleep.

00:26.577 --> 00:27.859
They promised me
my island back.

00:28.082 --> 00:29.198
Did you kill
those men out there?

00:29.308 --> 00:31.158
Your friends were
already dead when I got here.

00:31.286 --> 00:33.233
I don't have time
to do it the nice way.

00:33.342 --> 00:35.454
We made
a very simple arrangement.

00:35.576 --> 00:36.970
Everything's negotiable.

00:37.119 --> 00:37.993
Who are you?

00:38.193 --> 00:40.260
Tell me. Tell me!

00:40.366 --> 00:41.250
He's a government agent

00:41.363 --> 00:43.701
sent to spy on me
and turn me against Sam.

00:43.832 --> 00:44.760
<i>I'm gonna fix everything.</i>

00:44.861 --> 00:46.976
<i>- You'll see, Christine.</i>
<i>- What are you doing, Sam?</i>

00:47.209 --> 00:49.837
Captain Butler has a firing
solution on the Colorado.

00:51.850 --> 00:53.162
I could kill you right now.

00:53.283 --> 00:54.810
Do you want a war?

00:54.922 --> 00:55.757
When I was unconscious,

00:55.860 --> 00:57.181
someone took my firing key.

00:57.301 --> 00:59.552
We now have no
nuclear launch capabilities.

01:09.331 --> 01:10.828
Lieutenant Shepard, how much
longer is he gonna take?

01:10.930 --> 01:11.768
We do what we're told.

01:11.878 --> 01:13.257
'Cause that's worked out
so well for us so far.

01:16.158 --> 01:17.236
You almost done, XO?

01:17.458 --> 01:18.979
I think some of these guys
are about 30 seconds

01:19.109 --> 01:21.273
from coming over here
and getting an article 90.

01:21.676 --> 01:24.167
Well, it's gonna take as long
as it takes, Lieutenant.

01:24.507 --> 01:25.405
That's my bag, sir.

01:25.635 --> 01:26.744
I'm sorry. No one's exempt.

01:26.843 --> 01:28.715
We don't know who helped
those men with the BZ attack.

01:28.849 --> 01:29.909
We know who attacked us.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.435
Black ops with help
from Serrat.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.472
Then who stole
the epipens on the sub?

01:33.800 --> 01:35.703
There's somebody on the inside.
You know it, and I know it.

01:35.805 --> 01:36.750
Why don't you just
let me help you?

01:36.861 --> 01:38.239
Do I have to spell it out
for you, Lieutenant?

01:38.349 --> 01:39.347
So I'm a suspect?

01:39.446 --> 01:40.939
You think that I betrayed
the crew?

01:41.074 --> 01:42.187
I don't know.

01:42.321 --> 01:43.141
You're dismissed.

01:43.243 --> 01:44.261
You're pulling rank on me?

01:44.362 --> 01:46.833
I don't pull rank, Lieutenant.
I have rank.

01:57.616 --> 01:58.664
No sign of the key.

01:58.794 --> 02:00.297
But if we keep treating them
like this,

02:00.398 --> 02:01.339
we're gonna lose 'em.

02:01.445 --> 02:02.746
The only people on board
when the key was stolen

02:02.869 --> 02:03.953
were crew members, XO.

02:04.102 --> 02:05.506
One of them is the enemy.

02:05.691 --> 02:06.750
And until we find out who,

02:07.692 --> 02:09.651
the only people who can know
about the key are you and me.

02:10.852 --> 02:12.257
But it's been 48 hours, sir.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.805
If the goal was
to render us defenseless,

02:13.918 --> 02:15.198
then how come
we're not already dead?

02:15.300 --> 02:17.331
Our Judas hasn't reported
their success yet.

02:17.452 --> 02:18.572
But once they do...

02:19.386 --> 02:20.440
At least let me tell grace.

02:20.552 --> 02:23.073
Grace's father was hauled out of
here in military custody, Sam.

02:23.180 --> 02:24.218
Is it impossible to imagine her

02:24.330 --> 02:25.376
doing something rash?

02:26.068 --> 02:28.367
I back Lieutenant Shepard
100%, sir.

02:28.705 --> 02:29.805
100%.

02:31.297 --> 02:33.811
Until this thing is over,
we will be ruled by fact

02:33.938 --> 02:34.814
and not emotion.

02:34.914 --> 02:38.092
And the fact is,
we have been betrayed.

02:38.769 --> 02:40.197
We keep searching the crew.

02:40.504 --> 02:42.399
We keep this up,
we're not gonna have a crew.

02:44.259 --> 02:45.769
Quiet!
They tossed my bunk, too.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.134
You don't see me bitchin' about
somebody spittin' in my grits.

02:48.217 --> 02:49.786
XO wants
these coffin lockers open.

02:49.902 --> 02:50.701
Open 'em up.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.794
Now file out.

02:57.232 --> 02:58.368
Kowalski.

02:59.933 --> 03:01.118
What do you got there?

03:01.287 --> 03:02.743
It's a night guard, COB,

03:03.541 --> 03:04.835
for my overbite.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.044
Hey, Kurt Cobain.

03:09.334 --> 03:10.754
Where'd you get this?

03:12.537 --> 03:13.368
I...

03:13.983 --> 03:16.001
You been using?
You've been using!

03:19.839 --> 03:20.842
You want this junk?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.998
You want this? Huh?!

03:25.306 --> 03:27.078
Where'd you get it?

03:34.446 --> 03:35.824
The only two people
who know you're still alive

03:35.939 --> 03:36.909
are the two you're looking at.

03:37.022 --> 03:37.849
And that's lucky for you.

03:37.938 --> 03:40.561
I know a couple of Navy SEALs
that would love to come say hi.

03:40.731 --> 03:42.159
Who's the traitor on my boat?

03:43.443 --> 03:45.508
Here I thought you were gonna
start with my name.

03:46.109 --> 03:47.603
It's Booth.

03:47.847 --> 03:48.995
Booth?

03:49.474 --> 03:50.579
Okay, Booth.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.153
We know you had assistance
during the attack.

03:52.269 --> 03:53.928
We want to know
who you're working with.

03:54.097 --> 03:55.490
Come on, Captain.

03:56.231 --> 03:58.058
You must have heard the rumors.

03:59.627 --> 04:00.962
The word among
sub captains for a while

04:01.079 --> 04:02.906
has been that the CIA
has a sleeper agent

04:03.024 --> 04:04.655
on every nuclear sub...

04:05.095 --> 04:07.597
just in case some crazy captain
gets the wrong idea.

04:07.771 --> 04:09.609
And whoever it is in your crew,

04:09.732 --> 04:11.466
judging from the urgency
of the question,

04:11.571 --> 04:12.822
I guess they pulled it off.

04:12.969 --> 04:14.431
Pulled off what, exactly?

04:14.694 --> 04:15.845
Their mission.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.551
The firing key
from around your neck.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.346
Mm. I see I'm right.

04:22.450 --> 04:24.349
So that's who you're with--
the CIA?

04:26.547 --> 04:28.330
Hell of a feeling, isn't it?

04:29.091 --> 04:30.105
Enjoy your lunch,

04:31.115 --> 04:32.442
because I will keep you here

04:32.571 --> 04:33.843
where you can hear your breath

04:33.955 --> 04:35.835
and your heartbeat
and nothing else

04:36.057 --> 04:37.951
until you give me a name.

04:38.065 --> 04:39.799
Compartmentalization, Captain.

04:39.927 --> 04:41.090
Why would I know?

04:42.183 --> 04:43.679
You can torture me again,

04:43.789 --> 04:45.570
but I don't know a name,

04:46.303 --> 04:47.522
a face,

04:47.973 --> 04:49.495
or even a voice.

04:51.656 --> 04:52.706
Well, maybe he's lying.

04:52.809 --> 04:53.861
I doubt it.

04:53.965 --> 04:55.858
But there is one other person
who may know.

05:21.878 --> 05:23.363
You should post more guards.

05:23.474 --> 05:25.466
Why?
I have nothing to fear.

05:25.572 --> 05:27.098
You aided foreigners
in an attack on this island

05:27.214 --> 05:28.759
using a military drug.

05:29.464 --> 05:30.249
COB.

05:30.368 --> 05:33.283
- Tear it apart. Load
everything up in boxes. - Yes, sir.

05:34.423 --> 05:36.803
Something I value greatly was
taken from me during the attack.

05:36.945 --> 05:37.881
If you can tell me
where to find it

05:38.284 --> 05:40.112
or who took it, we're good.

05:40.243 --> 05:43.246
If not, I do have
28 cruise missiles on my boat.

05:43.355 --> 05:44.072
Cruise missile?

05:44.180 --> 05:46.273
I've been threatened
with many things,

05:46.453 --> 05:48.210
but never a cruise missile.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.008
Put 'em on the truck.

05:51.137 --> 05:52.371
We'll open 'em later.

05:53.719 --> 05:54.858
Search him.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.626
Last time I was here,
he was the one in control.

06:03.378 --> 06:05.608
I like it this way better.

06:10.211 --> 06:11.884
What are you looking at?

06:12.123 --> 06:13.537
The back of your neck.

06:14.013 --> 06:15.280
I like your hair up.

06:15.423 --> 06:17.260
I make better tips
with it down.

06:17.936 --> 06:20.924
Guys in bars like to think
the girls pouring their drinks

06:21.089 --> 06:22.339
are free spirits.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.232
That way, if they say something
interesting enough,

06:25.372 --> 06:26.924
they'll hop into bed with them.

06:27.249 --> 06:27.822
Mm.

06:27.932 --> 06:30.284
Can you imagine such stupidity?

06:34.226 --> 06:36.722
Mm. I can help you
bury your friends.

06:36.821 --> 06:38.129
I don't mind.

06:39.279 --> 06:41.147
Gotta be just me and Hopper.

06:46.177 --> 06:48.967
Go bury your friends.
Come back.

06:49.138 --> 06:50.345
I'll-- I'll close down
the bar.

06:50.465 --> 06:53.049
We'll drink ourselves stupid
and fire guns in the air,

06:53.177 --> 06:54.512
whatever you like.

06:54.841 --> 06:56.228
You're good for me.

06:56.653 --> 06:58.041
That's a problem?

06:59.527 --> 07:01.265
Just not used to it.

07:35.492 --> 07:37.397
<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

07:37.505 --> 07:39.593
<i>Tell me.</i>

07:39.696 --> 07:41.007
<i>Tell me!</i>

07:41.373 --> 07:42.871
What is all this?

07:48.409 --> 07:50.404
We had to store
Serrat's stuff somewhere.

07:50.515 --> 07:51.406
Everything has to be searched,

07:51.895 --> 07:52.886
including your office.

07:53.053 --> 07:54.558
You're looking through
my things?

07:55.173 --> 07:56.957
You want to tell me what you
were doing at Serrat's?

07:57.071 --> 07:59.948
I went to listen to music.
Is that allowed?

08:02.564 --> 08:04.504
Did you search
my computer as well?

08:04.658 --> 08:06.088
Okay, if you want
to search me, go ahead.

08:06.187 --> 08:07.095
I can't stop you.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.651
But you know
I was not involved.

08:08.777 --> 08:10.219
I don't know what you are.

08:10.604 --> 08:11.577
Not for sure.

08:11.737 --> 08:14.605
Well, maybe that makes
two of us.

08:34.664 --> 08:37.014
I know you're selling
to my guys.

08:37.145 --> 08:38.232
No more.

08:39.816 --> 08:41.058
Listen, old man,

08:41.826 --> 08:44.594
you need something,
you just ask.

08:45.043 --> 08:46.635
Don't deal to Navy.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.205
The nuclear attack
on Pakistan--

08:57.316 --> 08:58.212
was the terrorist threat

08:58.307 --> 08:59.269
the government used
to justify it--

08:59.379 --> 09:01.788
was it real
or was it just an excuse?

09:02.074 --> 09:04.807
A false flag to validate
the first shot of a man

09:04.920 --> 09:07.030
who wants to be an emperor,
not a president.

09:07.128 --> 09:09.125
And your boat
and the citizens of that nation

09:09.236 --> 09:10.175
paid the price.

09:10.309 --> 09:12.506
Yeah, enjoy it, man.
You're the good guys.

09:12.681 --> 09:13.938
But here's the twist--

09:14.113 --> 09:15.091
so are we.

09:15.196 --> 09:17.709
You killed two Navy SEALs.
You're the good guys?

09:17.996 --> 09:19.274
We tried to avoid that.

09:19.984 --> 09:21.524
My team was just supposed
to grab Hopper

09:21.657 --> 09:23.349
while the sleeper
took your captain's key.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.509
Why steal the firing key?

09:24.616 --> 09:26.367
Why not reach out?
Why not form an alliance?

09:26.502 --> 09:27.997
You may think
he's some kind of chess master,

09:28.111 --> 09:29.585
but nobody knows if Chaplin
is just bluffing

09:29.696 --> 09:31.026
or if he's actually insane.

09:31.152 --> 09:32.244
Either way, it's too dangerous

09:32.368 --> 09:34.570
to let him stay parked out here
with 17 nukes.

09:37.379 --> 09:41.044
Have you seen
his NSMRL psych profile?

09:41.540 --> 09:42.785
Do you know he has rage issues

09:42.912 --> 09:45.304
and borderline narcissistic
personality traits?

09:46.490 --> 09:48.298
You know who else he shares
those traits with?

09:48.425 --> 09:48.997
Who's that?

09:49.099 --> 09:50.474
Gadhafi, Stalin,

09:50.592 --> 09:51.429
Jim Jones.

09:51.537 --> 09:53.351
Churchill, Macarthur, Patton.

09:53.465 --> 09:56.279
Look, Booth, can you help
get us home or not?

09:56.717 --> 09:58.788
We don't want you
to come home, Sam.

09:59.245 --> 10:02.073
The Colorado needs to be
the symbol of resistance.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.673
We need you to stay here,
keep doing what you're doing.

10:04.785 --> 10:05.965
But not with Chaplin in charge.

10:06.187 --> 10:07.286
We want you.

10:07.447 --> 10:08.875
You we can work with.

10:08.996 --> 10:11.128
You got a funny way
of working with people, Booth.

10:11.305 --> 10:12.770
The president's not gonna last,

10:12.890 --> 10:14.027
not with you here.

10:14.148 --> 10:15.240
Everything's
turning against him.

10:15.350 --> 10:17.105
I'm talking six months,
maybe a year...

10:17.209 --> 10:18.066
- No, no, no.
- Then you can--

10:18.190 --> 10:19.656
I'm not waiting that long.

10:20.146 --> 10:22.764
What if Christine was here?
What if we brought her to you?

10:24.920 --> 10:27.030
I can make that happen, Sam.

10:39.350 --> 10:41.494
You know, you're not
my boss anymore.

10:41.602 --> 10:42.943
I work for your brother now.

10:44.048 --> 10:45.933
You still know what this is?

10:49.498 --> 10:52.468
We developed it for
NSA domestic surveillance.

10:52.708 --> 10:54.696
Plug it into
the USB port of the car.

10:54.841 --> 10:56.892
Give it 20 seconds
for the program to migrate.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.926
After that,
every time the driver

10:59.041 --> 11:00.631
makes a call
through the hands-free,

11:00.752 --> 11:03.285
you get the call on this.

11:04.382 --> 11:06.275
Now as for getting into
the car,

11:06.477 --> 11:07.612
use that.

11:07.717 --> 11:10.992
Infrared scrambler--
unlocks 99% of automobiles

11:11.141 --> 11:12.820
manufactured after 2008.

11:12.915 --> 11:14.915
I thought you would be the one
getting into the car.

11:15.054 --> 11:17.825
I'm just
bringing you your own tech,

11:17.936 --> 11:19.401
not committing a felony.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.574
For that, I'd need
a lot more money,

11:22.045 --> 11:23.956
and I'd have to clear it
with your brother.

11:24.070 --> 11:25.075
Go.

11:25.242 --> 11:26.433
Pleasure.

11:33.707 --> 11:35.123
Personnel files?

11:36.225 --> 11:37.640
There were 35 crew members
on board

11:37.751 --> 11:38.915
when the launch key was stolen.

11:39.027 --> 11:40.096
You think you can
figure out who took it

11:40.212 --> 11:41.157
by reading these?

11:41.261 --> 11:42.409
I think the sum
of a person's life

11:42.530 --> 11:44.002
can be deduced from its parts.

11:45.557 --> 11:48.314
The traitor must be
communicating with Langley.

11:49.089 --> 11:49.901
How?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.276
Honestly, sir, I don't know.

11:51.395 --> 11:52.901
Finding the key
is not <i>a</i> priority, XO.

11:53.038 --> 11:54.482
It's <i>the</i> priority.

11:54.688 --> 11:55.291
And remember,

11:55.369 --> 11:56.599
your key is a target, too.

11:57.786 --> 11:59.753
I'm instituting a curfew
on the crew.

11:59.851 --> 12:00.630
I understand what it means

12:00.754 --> 12:01.876
to be without our launch key,
sir, I do,

12:02.021 --> 12:03.272
and I am searching
without rest.

12:03.387 --> 12:04.400
But we need
to start thinking about

12:04.520 --> 12:05.448
the morale of the crew here.

12:05.548 --> 12:06.251
There's a time and place

12:06.366 --> 12:08.292
for taking the morale of
the crew into consideration.

12:08.418 --> 12:10.946
But right now, right here,
there is a traitor on my boat

12:11.063 --> 12:13.500
who has put us in a position
of mortal weakness.

12:13.604 --> 12:15.638
We are searching for a key
on an island.

12:15.775 --> 12:17.909
"Needle in a haystack"
doesn't even come close.

12:19.586 --> 12:22.091
But I will continue searching
until you tell me to stop.

12:25.608 --> 12:27.687
But with respect, sir, you need
to start looking at the crew,

12:28.088 --> 12:29.389
not just their files.

12:37.546 --> 12:38.796
You know...

12:39.681 --> 12:42.302
We're not the only ones
putting people in the ground.

12:43.958 --> 12:45.224
What are you talking about?

12:46.189 --> 12:48.265
That black-ops team
that came after us.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.088
Navy buried them this morning.

12:51.472 --> 12:52.435
Yeah.

12:52.744 --> 12:53.804
Four graves.

12:56.874 --> 12:58.482
How many were on that team?

13:01.232 --> 13:02.547
Where's the fifth black op?

13:03.918 --> 13:04.797
There were four.

13:04.908 --> 13:06.856
No, you buried four,
but there were five.

13:07.092 --> 13:08.320
One's still alive.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.618
If that were true, I'd know.

13:09.751 --> 13:11.629
Captain or the XO
would have told me.

13:13.858 --> 13:15.628
You sure about that?

13:16.298 --> 13:17.648
Let's go, King.

13:23.383 --> 13:25.530
Sir, did any
of the black ops survive

13:25.652 --> 13:26.933
the BZ attack?

13:27.070 --> 13:28.292
No.

13:28.530 --> 13:29.558
Why do you ask?

13:30.285 --> 13:31.175
Just thought it was relevant

13:31.315 --> 13:33.379
since you're searching
for BZ, sir.

13:34.473 --> 13:35.904
You advanced rapidly.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.267
How was it, specifically,
you ended up on my boat?

13:39.840 --> 13:42.551
I always assumed it was
because you asked for me.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.939
Maybe my father
pulled some strings.

13:50.067 --> 13:51.454
I really don't know, sir.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.491
I like to think
I'm best qualified,

13:54.645 --> 13:56.261
that I proved myself.

13:57.105 --> 13:58.578
Thank you, Lieutenant.

14:12.148 --> 14:13.020
Sorry, Lieutenant.

14:13.141 --> 14:14.261
- I--
- What's in the backpack?

14:14.430 --> 14:16.271
Nothing, ma'am.

14:25.439 --> 14:28.000
You know the captain's
implemented a curfew?

14:28.275 --> 14:30.106
Yes, ma'am,
but we'll be back by then.

14:30.221 --> 14:31.625
It was just gonna be me
and a couple of girls,

14:31.728 --> 14:33.472
blow off a little steam
before lights out.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.740
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I should know better.

14:36.867 --> 14:39.245
Go. You didn't see me.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.921
Uh... Lieutenant?

14:42.519 --> 14:43.628
What is it, Cortez?

14:44.159 --> 14:45.712
You doing anything right now?

14:55.752 --> 14:56.698
Hey.

14:57.113 --> 14:57.998
Ohh!

14:58.571 --> 15:00.104
Ohh! Ohh!

15:07.023 --> 15:08.394
I warned you.

15:09.823 --> 15:10.734
You tell your...

15:10.854 --> 15:11.781
friends...

15:12.349 --> 15:13.749
your boss...

15:14.348 --> 15:15.784
and your kids...

15:16.164 --> 15:18.018
don't deal to the Navy.

15:18.198 --> 15:19.698
Next time,
these go in your head.

15:25.723 --> 15:28.341
You can stop pretending to check
your Twitter, Ms. Sinclair.

15:28.452 --> 15:29.693
The Admiral isn't coming.

15:29.817 --> 15:30.725
Who are you?

15:30.823 --> 15:32.010
Forrest.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.632
I'm a friend of his.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.494
And a friend of yours now.

15:37.590 --> 15:38.612
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:38.719 --> 15:39.915
Admiral Shepard is in jail,

15:40.041 --> 15:42.146
and not the kind
where they have visiting hours.

15:42.678 --> 15:44.610
Do you know Amanda Straugh?

15:45.557 --> 15:47.552
White House Senior Advisor,
loved scotch,

15:47.762 --> 15:50.474
died last week in a plane crash
over the pacific.

15:50.731 --> 15:51.969
Not exactly.

15:52.078 --> 15:53.781
Straugh was shot and killed
during negotiations

15:53.895 --> 15:55.320
on Sainte Marina.

15:56.139 --> 15:57.871
The President has a problem.

15:57.983 --> 16:00.330
He says this woman's body is
at the bottom of the ocean.

16:00.473 --> 16:02.079
If this photo
were to show up on the news,

16:02.300 --> 16:04.223
millions would know
he's lying about it.

16:04.329 --> 16:06.903
They might start wondering
what else he's lying about.

16:12.959 --> 16:14.208
Wait, wait, wait.
I thought we were talking about

16:14.323 --> 16:15.454
the best lies
we ever pulled off.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.926
Unh-unh. I don't have
any of those.

16:17.026 --> 16:18.793
You are looking
at a straight-A,

16:18.958 --> 16:21.047
never cheated,
never got in trouble.

16:21.176 --> 16:22.129
Sad, but true.

16:22.531 --> 16:23.751
Okay, all that was a lie.

16:25.186 --> 16:26.375
What about you,
Lieutenant Shepard?

16:26.514 --> 16:29.144
Yeah, they don't make 'em
more straight-A than you.

16:29.271 --> 16:30.598
Well, I'm relaxing.

16:30.743 --> 16:32.663
Yeah? Then start looking
relaxed, Lieutenant.

16:32.779 --> 16:33.890
Oh! Ooh!

16:45.474 --> 16:47.609
They're just mineral samples.

16:51.055 --> 16:53.027
You and Serrat
have the same vials.

16:53.527 --> 16:55.446
You were at his place
sharing I don't know what.

16:55.594 --> 16:56.887
I don't have to answer you.

16:56.999 --> 16:57.940
Yes, you do.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.411
Or what, you'll hurt me
like you hurt that man?

17:00.586 --> 17:02.443
- That wasn't me.
- Oh, come on.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.580
Hey, what are you doing?

17:06.799 --> 17:07.730
Look at this.

17:07.839 --> 17:08.714
No, turn it off.

17:08.820 --> 17:09.648
No. No, no, no.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.095
Does it look like
I'm enjoying this?

17:11.214 --> 17:11.791
Okay, turn it off.

17:11.897 --> 17:12.788
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:12.890 --> 17:15.027
- Does it look like I want this?
- Sam.

17:15.173 --> 17:16.866
<i>Everything's gonna</i>
<i>be different now, I promise.</i>

17:17.016 --> 17:18.179
<i>Stop it.</i>

17:18.298 --> 17:18.919
What's this?

17:19.019 --> 17:21.519
<i>I always find my way back,</i>
<i>don't I?</i>

17:35.268 --> 17:36.521
Well, before I went into
the academy,

17:36.616 --> 17:38.644
I-I took the SATs
for someone else.

17:39.778 --> 17:41.199
You know, the girl--
the girl was really smart,

17:41.304 --> 17:42.366
but she just
couldn't take tests.

17:42.451 --> 17:44.563
You know, she had
this anxiety disorder,

17:44.673 --> 17:46.160
and her family had no money,

17:46.269 --> 17:47.688
so if, uh, she didn't get
a scholarship,

17:47.793 --> 17:48.627
she couldn't go to college.

17:48.725 --> 17:51.153
So I copied her ID
and took the test.

17:51.315 --> 17:53.625
I think the statute
of limitations has passed.

17:53.723 --> 17:55.112
To the statute of limitations.

18:08.557 --> 18:10.008
Can I ask you something,
Cortez?

18:10.116 --> 18:11.175
Yes, ma'am.

18:11.427 --> 18:12.727
What happened with Serrat?

18:13.023 --> 18:14.939
You were locked in that room
with Red and Josh for days.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.273
What happened?

18:17.355 --> 18:19.303
I know what everyone
<i>thinks</i> I did.

18:19.922 --> 18:21.217
But I didn't.

18:21.357 --> 18:22.581
I promised him
I'd be his eyes and ears

18:22.689 --> 18:24.013
if he'd let us live.

18:24.831 --> 18:26.702
Tell him what was
going on with the sub.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.841
A few hours later,
he killed Red.

18:29.091 --> 18:30.528
Deal was off.

18:30.664 --> 18:31.826
Would you have?

18:32.253 --> 18:33.341
Been a traitor?

18:37.253 --> 18:38.568
I had a dog...

18:39.184 --> 18:40.519
when I was a little kid,

18:40.832 --> 18:43.750
and one day,
it turned on me, bit me.

18:44.611 --> 18:47.717
My dad... shot it.

18:48.299 --> 18:51.683
Said once a dog turns on you,
you never trust it again.

18:51.984 --> 18:53.828
Only thing to do
is put it down.

18:54.475 --> 18:56.223
Same with a traitor.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.636
Christine, what would you like
the American people

19:01.770 --> 19:03.708
to know about your husband?

19:03.854 --> 19:07.108
The administration keeps
calling my husband a terrorist.

19:07.449 --> 19:10.136
But then why were they trying
to negotiate with him?

19:10.378 --> 19:13.068
And why are they keeping
those negotiations such a secret

19:13.231 --> 19:15.504
that they had to lie
about Amanda Straugh's death?

19:15.612 --> 19:18.829
You're making
some very serious allegations.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.085
Does this look like
a plane crash?

19:26.286 --> 19:28.852
Amanda Straugh was shot by one
of the government's own people,

19:28.972 --> 19:30.709
and the White House
is trying to cover it up,

19:30.891 --> 19:32.670
just like they are trying
to cover up the truth

19:32.807 --> 19:35.940
about my husband
and the USS Colorado.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.018
Thank you, mama.

19:51.674 --> 19:52.748
Who did this to you?

19:52.865 --> 19:54.089
Who do you think?

20:04.640 --> 20:07.482
All right. Listen up.
Fall in.

20:08.315 --> 20:10.206
Everybody, fall in.

20:10.727 --> 20:13.527
Tighten it up. Let's go.
Lock it down.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.423
Stop your bellyaching
and fall in here.

20:25.611 --> 20:27.131
So the Junior Lt.
sees this little boy

20:27.260 --> 20:28.751
sitting on the sidewalk...

20:29.603 --> 20:31.404
playing with a pile of manure.

20:32.257 --> 20:34.135
The Lt. asks the little boy,

20:35.007 --> 20:36.642
"What are you doing
playing with that manure?"

20:36.757 --> 20:37.719
And the boy says,

20:37.942 --> 20:40.231
"I'm building an NCO".

20:40.594 --> 20:42.510
Lt. runs back
to company HQ,

20:42.627 --> 20:44.350
gets his section chief,
who asks the little boy,

20:44.460 --> 20:47.680
"Son... why are you playing
with a pile of manure?"

20:48.392 --> 20:50.887
Little boy says,
"I'm building an NCO".

20:51.656 --> 20:53.659
Chief goes and gets the COB,

20:53.877 --> 20:55.318
who goes back
to the little boy.

20:57.032 --> 20:57.676
"What-- what--

20:57.792 --> 20:59.277
what are you doing
playing with that manure?"

20:59.921 --> 21:01.204
Little boy says...

21:02.052 --> 21:03.785
"I'm building an NCO".

21:03.894 --> 21:06.146
"Why are you building
an NCO?"

21:06.594 --> 21:09.443
Little boy pauses and says,
"Because, sir,

21:10.481 --> 21:12.878
I don't have enough crap
to build an officer."

21:15.722 --> 21:16.485
What do you get when you breed

21:16.592 --> 21:18.526
a West Point cadet
and a groundhog?

21:18.697 --> 21:20.596
Six more weeks of bad football.

21:22.634 --> 21:23.434
How come the army football team

21:23.609 --> 21:25.259
doesn't have ice
on the sidelines?

21:25.369 --> 21:26.760
The guy with the recipe
graduated.

21:28.534 --> 21:29.916
That's right.

21:31.196 --> 21:32.330
That's right.
Now listen up.

21:32.435 --> 21:34.006
Listen up! Listen up!
Listen up!

21:34.127 --> 21:36.242
I know we've put you through
a hell of a lot lately.

21:36.388 --> 21:38.253
And all I can tell you--
it's for a good reason.

21:38.742 --> 21:40.299
But...

21:42.235 --> 21:43.776
I hereby order you...

21:45.715 --> 21:49.286
to enjoy the 1991
Army/Navy football game.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.372
Spoiler alert--
the crunchies don't win.

21:58.682 --> 22:00.250
But look. Look, look, look,
look, look.

22:00.534 --> 22:03.793
You are the best crew an XO
could have the honor of leading.

22:06.043 --> 22:08.065
Thank you, and I appreciate it.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.685
Sir.

22:36.971 --> 22:38.229
Brought you a beer,

22:38.713 --> 22:39.621
if you want it.

22:40.213 --> 22:41.304
Thank you.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.171
You should go back and watch
the game with the crew.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.522
I just...

22:51.946 --> 22:54.126
I just wanted to state,
for the record,

22:54.688 --> 22:57.164
that I'm with you, Captain,

22:57.571 --> 22:58.919
all the way...

23:00.260 --> 23:01.909
whenever you need me.

23:05.713 --> 23:07.638
Cortez, thank you.

23:09.098 --> 23:13.332
But you should not
seek me out alone.

23:13.499 --> 23:15.108
There's an order and a morality

23:15.216 --> 23:17.510
that we both have to follow.

23:18.663 --> 23:21.681
Well, it seems like
everything's changed, Captain.

23:26.291 --> 23:28.082
Not everything.

23:28.787 --> 23:30.176
Understood?

23:57.565 --> 23:59.210
What do you got there, Sam?

23:59.656 --> 24:00.826
Oh, boy.

24:05.349 --> 24:06.791
Are you kidding me?

24:07.014 --> 24:08.540
Sure. I mean, the guy
you got in there

24:08.654 --> 24:09.584
killed two of my pals.

24:09.688 --> 24:10.935
So why not let him
enjoy a cold one?

24:11.041 --> 24:12.428
I need to know what he knows.

24:12.539 --> 24:14.168
Yeah, that makes three of us.

24:16.693 --> 24:17.984
Stand down.

24:18.632 --> 24:19.854
Let us do what we do.

24:20.611 --> 24:21.138
When we're done,

24:21.239 --> 24:23.024
we got a nice resting place
for him out in the jungle.

24:23.118 --> 24:24.148
Listen to me.
I've been working him.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.960
I'm building trust
and I'm close.

24:26.516 --> 24:27.716
So right now you gotta back off

24:27.824 --> 24:29.068
and let me finish
what I started.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.650
What do you think he knows?

24:31.014 --> 24:32.997
I think he knows
how to get us all home.

24:34.802 --> 24:35.504
Come on, King.

24:35.622 --> 24:36.795
This guy's an amateur.
Let's go.

24:36.900 --> 24:37.907
No, Hop.

24:38.798 --> 24:40.247
We fall back.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.898
XO's got this one.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.543
For now.

24:56.708 --> 24:58.079
How are you sleeping?

24:58.463 --> 24:59.703
Not good?

25:00.341 --> 25:02.164
Wonder how
your wife's sleeping?

25:02.919 --> 25:05.049
So what, JSOC gave you
the download on Christine,

25:05.174 --> 25:06.447
and now you think you know me?

25:06.636 --> 25:07.571
No.

25:07.649 --> 25:09.510
They gave me
the download on you--

25:10.058 --> 25:12.359
North Korea,
the gun to your head,

25:12.491 --> 25:13.386
the click.

25:13.491 --> 25:14.785
I know you can't
stop blaming yourself

25:14.902 --> 25:16.082
for those seven men who died

25:16.189 --> 25:17.677
so you could make it back home.

25:18.281 --> 25:20.658
Now Marcus has landed you
in prison again.

25:20.986 --> 25:21.790
Yeah, it's beautiful,

25:21.917 --> 25:24.815
but... let's be real
about what it is.

25:26.422 --> 25:28.528
How much are you willing
to give that man?

25:31.298 --> 25:33.185
Your sleeper will be
communicating with Langley

25:33.338 --> 25:35.082
by a secure radio channel,

25:35.208 --> 25:37.691
which means there's a comm site
somewhere on this island.

25:37.808 --> 25:39.772
Find that site,
you'll have him.

25:40.499 --> 25:41.356
Now...

25:41.589 --> 25:43.729
you ready
to start helping yourself?

25:48.917 --> 25:50.779
If we were to do this,

25:51.412 --> 25:53.140
how would we do it?

25:54.096 --> 25:55.737
Simple snatch and grab.

25:55.869 --> 25:57.708
Marcus will be kept
out of sight, but treated well

25:57.923 --> 25:59.202
while you run things here,

25:59.315 --> 26:01.365
forcing a change of guard
at the White House.

26:01.582 --> 26:04.853
Then the new administration
arranges for amnesty...

26:05.147 --> 26:06.622
for all of you.

26:23.121 --> 26:24.776
That fifth black op is alive.

26:24.898 --> 26:27.553
Your Captain and your XO
are keeping him locked away.

26:31.521 --> 26:33.989
Bet you always raised your hand
first in class, didn't you?

26:47.139 --> 26:48.546
No, stop!

26:49.458 --> 26:50.997
Don't come near me.

26:52.621 --> 26:54.473
Everybody keep away from her!

27:04.286 --> 27:06.137
Snyder, you need to stay calm.

27:06.696 --> 27:08.215
It's on a timer.

27:09.352 --> 27:10.290
How much time is left?

27:10.404 --> 27:12.270
I don't know.
Take it off.

27:12.443 --> 27:14.179
- Just take it off of me.
- I can't.

27:14.972 --> 27:16.322
It's wired to the buckle.

27:16.447 --> 27:17.337
You gotta stop shaking.

27:17.439 --> 27:18.686
I'm trying.

27:19.364 --> 27:21.210
Try harder.

27:21.705 --> 27:23.394
Hey, calm down.
It's okay.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.739
We got you.

27:27.293 --> 27:29.044
How much time is left on it?

27:31.211 --> 27:32.572
Plenty.

27:35.251 --> 27:36.787
Just take it off of me.

27:37.706 --> 27:39.318
Okay, okay.

27:42.977 --> 27:46.231
- What happened?
- Nothing. It's okay. It's okay.

27:46.352 --> 27:47.429
Grace.

27:49.453 --> 27:52.166
Grace, I need eyes.

27:53.270 --> 27:55.469
Here.

27:57.947 --> 27:59.111
Okay.

28:01.587 --> 28:04.425
Now I gotta get that red wire
without touching the yellow.

28:05.408 --> 28:07.125
Can you keep the lead away?

28:07.514 --> 28:09.018
The yellow lead.

28:42.532 --> 28:44.131
Time's up.

28:55.656 --> 28:56.587
Are you out of your mind?

28:56.701 --> 28:58.069
I have white house lawyers
calling me

28:58.163 --> 28:59.365
about this interview
you taped today.

28:59.457 --> 29:01.727
You did the exact opposite
of what I told you.

29:01.863 --> 29:03.516
The reporter said
that maybe it would help.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.276
The reporter's gonna say
whatever gets her the story!

29:05.392 --> 29:07.047
And where the hell
did you get this picture

29:07.157 --> 29:08.033
of Amanda Straugh?

29:08.125 --> 29:09.305
Somebody put it in my mailbox.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.213
Somebody put it in your mailbox?
What is wrong with you?

29:11.299 --> 29:13.568
Stop yelling at me!
You don't get to yell at me.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.724
I am doing the <i>best</i>
that I can here.

29:15.813 --> 29:18.067
Do you understand
how much pressure I am under?

29:18.194 --> 29:19.480
I am all alone here,

29:19.587 --> 29:20.849
and my husband
is out there somewhere,

29:20.942 --> 29:22.733
about to get killed
at any second.

29:24.569 --> 29:26.333
You're right.
It's my fault.

29:26.443 --> 29:27.800
I should've kept an eye on you.

29:28.154 --> 29:29.245
I'm sorry.

29:29.381 --> 29:30.455
It's just, um...

29:30.554 --> 29:32.606
It's all just starting
to get to me--

29:32.740 --> 29:34.454
the empty house,
the sleeping alone,

29:34.558 --> 29:35.509
except I can't even sleep

29:35.616 --> 29:36.884
because the damn faucet
won't stop dripping.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.418
Hey, hey, calm down.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.353
It's all gonna be fine.

29:42.491 --> 29:44.267
Why don't I take a look
at the faucet?

30:06.817 --> 30:09.372
I'm gonna need, uh,
long-nose pliers for this.

30:09.489 --> 30:11.412
I got a tool kit in the trunk.

30:11.956 --> 30:13.050
What? Wait.

30:13.722 --> 30:14.661
I'll be right back.

30:14.783 --> 30:16.149
Look...

30:18.029 --> 30:20.715
I'm sorry that I
disappointed you today.

30:27.149 --> 30:28.517
You are
the only one that's left

30:28.632 --> 30:30.188
that's fighting for me.

30:30.376 --> 30:32.387
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

30:41.872 --> 30:43.421
No, no.

30:43.613 --> 30:44.904
I-I'm sorry.

30:45.113 --> 30:45.918
Was it just me?

30:46.013 --> 30:47.857
I don't know.
But it can't be me.

30:51.991 --> 30:54.675
Look, I'm having very confusing
feelings right now

30:54.795 --> 30:56.224
and...

30:56.337 --> 30:58.745
can you just be patient
with that?

30:58.966 --> 31:00.214
Of course.

31:14.143 --> 31:15.525
You were good.

31:19.370 --> 31:20.636
So were you.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.316
What? What?

31:37.394 --> 31:39.447
Been wondering
what that looks like.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.085
One time thing.

32:21.299 --> 32:22.402
Sure.

32:23.977 --> 32:25.294
Thanks.

32:26.965 --> 32:28.200
Thank you.

32:40.479 --> 32:42.532
Where is he?!

32:43.250 --> 32:44.302
Where am I?

32:44.403 --> 32:46.220
I don't think you know
what you are looking for.

32:46.619 --> 32:47.592
Bring him.

32:48.404 --> 32:49.413
I presume you are looking
for the man

32:49.531 --> 32:51.378
who strapped a bomb
to one of your people?

32:51.936 --> 32:52.965
I just heard.

32:53.813 --> 32:55.017
You see?

32:55.664 --> 32:56.719
I caught him for you.

32:56.831 --> 32:57.761
I came for you.

32:57.886 --> 32:59.886
Uh, me. Yeah, yeah,
you could take me,

32:59.989 --> 33:01.405
but the people won't allow it

33:01.547 --> 33:04.025
because I'm their friend,
and they love me.

33:04.154 --> 33:05.682
And they know
I have done nothing.

33:05.807 --> 33:07.823
This is the man responsible
for your bomb.

33:08.731 --> 33:09.678
It's sad.

33:09.819 --> 33:11.456
He thought it would impress me.

33:11.536 --> 33:12.627
Tell him.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.053
It was my idea.

33:14.155 --> 33:16.695
I did it. Just me.

33:24.065 --> 33:26.327
You should be grateful
I brought this man to justice.

33:26.543 --> 33:27.748
I will deal with him
appropriately.

33:27.844 --> 33:28.753
No.

33:28.850 --> 33:30.096
I will.

33:32.085 --> 33:33.498
This man has admitted

33:33.920 --> 33:36.615
to the attempted mass murder
of my crew.

34:06.457 --> 34:07.692
Try me again,

34:07.832 --> 34:09.889
and I will be your judge, jury,

34:10.005 --> 34:12.161
and executioner.

34:44.690 --> 34:45.612
Christine.

34:45.717 --> 34:46.716
Someone's calling him.

34:48.831 --> 34:50.292
Hello.

34:50.387 --> 34:51.804
This is Curry.
What do you have?

34:51.885 --> 34:52.909
What the hell's going on?

34:53.097 --> 34:54.186
Somebody put

34:54.299 --> 34:55.319
the photo in her mailbox,

34:55.427 --> 34:56.714
which means you've got a leak
in the White House,

34:56.835 --> 34:58.918
so you can stop blaming me
for not keeping her in line.

34:59.065 --> 35:00.134
And look,

35:00.286 --> 35:01.804
I don't want
to do this anymore.

35:02.107 --> 35:04.058
Do you want
to see Daniel again?

35:04.227 --> 35:05.388
Of course I do.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.053
He's my son.

35:07.411 --> 35:10.199
All I'm saying is, you've got
her in an impossible situation.

35:10.298 --> 35:11.781
What do you expect her to do?

35:12.071 --> 35:13.345
Let me throw her a line.

35:13.452 --> 35:15.016
Just stick to the plan

35:15.125 --> 35:16.569
and don't get
too attached, Paul.

35:16.662 --> 35:18.441
The parameters
can always change.

35:18.561 --> 35:19.891
I'll check in later.

35:26.044 --> 35:27.134
Sam.

35:30.671 --> 35:33.579
Everything that happened
was crazy, right?

35:33.756 --> 35:36.326
They drugged us.
The BZ affected us all.

35:36.456 --> 35:37.781
I'm sorry.

35:39.028 --> 35:41.826
Only an American
would apologize for a kiss.

35:43.936 --> 35:45.941
I'm not working with Serrat.

35:46.336 --> 35:49.434
I am paying a debt
my ex-boyfriend had.

35:49.576 --> 35:51.184
Serrat paid him
to test the soil here

35:51.303 --> 35:52.642
for rare earth minerals.

35:52.781 --> 35:55.099
That's what
the samples were for.

35:57.295 --> 35:58.282
This island--

35:58.404 --> 36:00.808
it is worth a lot of money.

36:00.952 --> 36:02.049
Okay.

36:02.216 --> 36:03.062
I wanted you to know

36:03.173 --> 36:05.551
so you would not think
I lied to you.

36:05.686 --> 36:08.389
But I need you to promise me
you will keep it secret,

36:08.501 --> 36:10.092
and not only from Serrat.

36:10.389 --> 36:11.859
From everybody.

36:12.365 --> 36:15.029
I can't promise you
anything right now.

36:15.169 --> 36:16.329
Okay.

36:17.093 --> 36:18.093
That can be your choice,

36:18.204 --> 36:21.788
but... now you know
that I will not lie to you.

36:23.026 --> 36:24.973
That's my choice.

36:39.444 --> 36:41.327
All right, easy now.
Easy now.

36:41.893 --> 36:43.199
Aah! Aah!

36:49.477 --> 36:51.037
Hey.

36:51.472 --> 36:53.023
Your men are prisoners
on this island.

36:53.138 --> 36:54.103
Why are you so angry about them

36:54.231 --> 36:55.917
paying me
for a few hours of escape?

36:56.054 --> 36:57.264
Why do you feel as though
you can control

36:57.374 --> 36:58.664
what other people do?

36:58.784 --> 37:00.128
Why are you so afraid?

37:01.140 --> 37:02.318
I've lived all over the world.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.806
I've seen many men like you.

37:03.917 --> 37:05.399
You have a thirst, I think.

37:05.502 --> 37:08.474
What is your particular poison?

37:08.819 --> 37:11.963
Heroin? Cocaine?

37:12.166 --> 37:13.234
No. No.

37:13.320 --> 37:15.102
For you, something more exotic.

37:15.218 --> 37:16.503
Apnoea?

37:17.214 --> 37:18.553
Oxy?

37:21.115 --> 37:22.165
Fentanyl?

37:23.103 --> 37:24.029
Ahh.

37:24.154 --> 37:25.374
The eyes don't lie.

37:25.501 --> 37:28.208
Your pupils just went
like this, my friend.

37:28.381 --> 37:29.623
I kicked that--

37:29.727 --> 37:31.173
I kicked that a long time ago.

37:31.276 --> 37:32.360
End of story.

37:32.462 --> 37:34.193
Oh, yeah. You know,
for someone like you,

37:34.346 --> 37:36.722
the story never really ends,
does it?

37:36.839 --> 37:38.473
This is
a powerful painkiller, yes?

37:38.625 --> 37:39.706
I know pain.

37:39.926 --> 37:41.117
You recall my mother?

37:41.293 --> 37:42.510
I haven't had the pleasure.

37:42.635 --> 37:43.697
Ah, but you have.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.983
She's with one arm.
Yes.

37:46.955 --> 37:48.329
Yes, yes, surely,
surely you noticed her.

37:48.445 --> 37:49.886
- Aah! Aah!
- Yes, I think.

37:50.091 --> 37:50.957
Aah. Aah.

37:51.052 --> 37:52.356
You see, when I was a boy,

37:52.566 --> 37:54.182
some men came to my village.

37:54.298 --> 37:56.057
They wanted to take me
into the bush with them.

37:56.239 --> 37:57.758
My mother tried to stop them.

37:57.894 --> 37:59.029
Get 'em away from me!

37:59.132 --> 38:00.338
She was only 12
when I was born,

38:00.434 --> 38:01.646
so she was my mother,

38:01.750 --> 38:03.910
but she was also
like my sister.

38:04.036 --> 38:04.583
Ah.

38:04.684 --> 38:05.788
The men, they said to me,

38:06.003 --> 38:08.800
they said, "You go
take this machete now, Eah Bo.

38:08.924 --> 38:10.458
You're going to
chop off your mother's arm

38:10.575 --> 38:12.459
or we will kill her."

38:13.156 --> 38:14.356
Can you imagine?

38:14.491 --> 38:15.797
Ah. Ah.

38:17.389 --> 38:21.142
That was my first day
as a soldier.

38:25.275 --> 38:27.005
Aah! God!

38:27.110 --> 38:29.840
Aah! Aah!

38:29.975 --> 38:31.748
Aah!

38:32.199 --> 38:34.413
Aah! Aah!

38:34.770 --> 38:35.999
Aah!

38:36.547 --> 38:38.015
Ohh!

38:38.454 --> 38:39.814
Ohh! Ohh!

38:39.979 --> 38:42.283
Now I'm going to take
the pain away.

38:47.301 --> 38:49.314
Yes.

38:51.616 --> 38:52.789
Yes.

38:52.869 --> 38:54.845
This is for when
the pain comes back.

38:58.383 --> 39:01.834
♪ You know it's you,
you know it's you ♪

39:03.307 --> 39:05.688
Ah!

39:05.857 --> 39:07.438
Aah!

39:07.599 --> 39:09.688
Ah. Aah!

39:23.768 --> 39:25.245
Ah.

39:49.475 --> 39:51.352
So we're executioners now?

39:53.529 --> 39:55.209
There's no other option.

39:58.281 --> 40:00.874
Have your conversations
with Booth borne fruit?

40:01.340 --> 40:03.618
Well, he claims that
whoever the sleeper agent is

40:03.739 --> 40:05.761
has a comm site on the island

40:05.887 --> 40:07.403
to communicate
with their handlers.

40:07.770 --> 40:09.958
He also claims
that we're the resistance

40:10.852 --> 40:12.368
to what's going on back home.

40:13.583 --> 40:14.752
Maybe he's right.

40:16.273 --> 40:18.869
Okay. We stop looking
for the key.

40:19.127 --> 40:20.547
No more rousting the crew.

40:20.882 --> 40:22.377
We look for the comm site.

40:22.553 --> 40:23.932
We find the traitor,

40:24.422 --> 40:26.507
we find the key.
