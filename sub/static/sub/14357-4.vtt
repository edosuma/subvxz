<i>El Gato!</i>

00:32.213 --> 00:34.864
<b>2x04- "Bees"</b>

00:39.188 --> 00:40.730
<i>Hey, catch!</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:49.484
Excuse me,
- Huh?

00:49.506 --> 00:52.951
I see you have Se?ora Zapata's
prized Sweetie Boy doll.

00:53.118 --> 00:56.955
Did you purchase it fairly,
or are you filthy thieves?!

00:57.122 --> 00:59.666
Uh, the second one?

00:59.791 --> 01:01.084
<i>Return it at once!</i>

01:03.379 --> 01:05.464
Or face my boots!

01:07.049 --> 01:09.759
What are you going to do with your books?

01:10.511 --> 01:13.013
I said "boots"!

01:33.909 --> 01:35.869
Puss? Oh!

01:36.620 --> 01:38.205
Hello.

01:38.414 --> 01:39.956
I have a little bit of a predicament

01:40.040 --> 01:42.334
I was hoping you could un-pickle for me.

01:42.501 --> 01:44.753
Anything for a beautiful se?orita.

01:44.836 --> 01:47.464
We have a little visitor at the orphanage.

01:47.548 --> 01:48.382
A bee.

01:48.632 --> 01:49.466
Huh?

01:50.092 --> 01:51.218
A bee?

01:51.510 --> 01:54.179
Well, I am quite busy at the moment.

01:54.846 --> 01:57.057
Have you tried opening a window?
- Yes.

01:57.224 --> 01:59.101
Shooing it away with a scarf?
- Yes.

01:59.184 --> 02:02.104
Perhaps the orphans could just
live outside for a while.

02:02.187 --> 02:04.147
Fresh air is good for children.

02:04.231 --> 02:07.359
Puss? Are you... afraid of bees?

02:09.402 --> 02:11.947
Puss in Boots?
Afraid of bees?

02:12.030 --> 02:13.156
That is ridiculous!

02:13.240 --> 02:15.534
That is the craziest thing
I have ever heard,

02:15.618 --> 02:17.661
and I have talked to Artephius.

02:17.744 --> 02:19.371
Oh, good, then you'll help us.

02:19.455 --> 02:21.039
Fine.

02:22.874 --> 02:25.168
Okay, so it's right in there.

02:40.309 --> 02:44.146
Obviously, I cannot work under these
terrible conditions. Goodbye.

02:44.229 --> 02:46.315
Oh! Cleevil!

02:46.482 --> 02:48.191
What was our agreement?

02:48.275 --> 02:52.696
"No playing the gobflute
around anyone who has ears."

02:52.779 --> 02:54.239
That's right.

02:55.031 --> 02:57.742
All clear. Can you get the bee
out of the orphanage now?

02:57.826 --> 02:59.244
I... I... I, um...

02:59.328 --> 03:02.998
"Being brave does not mean
that fears have you none.

03:03.081 --> 03:07.002
It means you face up to your fears
and do what must be done."

03:07.085 --> 03:10.797
I am not afraid of bees!
You are the one who is afraid of bees!

03:10.880 --> 03:14.510
Yes, I am afraid of bees,
but I'm not the town hero.

03:14.593 --> 03:17.012
Fine. I am going in.

03:59.722 --> 04:03.308
It is gone. Another victory
for Puss in...

04:06.562 --> 04:09.105
Back, fiend! Back!

04:18.365 --> 04:19.199
<i>En garde!</i>

04:31.107 --> 04:33.129
<i>Puss in the Boots!</i>

04:45.684 --> 04:49.145
I am... triumphant.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.191
Interesting word choice.

04:53.900 --> 04:57.153
Well, that is taken care...

04:59.531 --> 05:00.407
Huh?

05:03.660 --> 05:06.329
Bees! Children, get inside.

05:06.413 --> 05:08.665
Dulcinea, close the windows!

05:19.468 --> 05:23.221
That's a good boy.

05:26.475 --> 05:28.560
Mayor Temeroso, are you not afraid?

05:28.811 --> 05:32.188
Interestingly, bees are the one thing
I do not fear.

05:32.272 --> 05:34.399
I had a pet bee as a child.

05:34.483 --> 05:36.819
Eh...
We were very poor.

05:45.994 --> 05:48.246
The bees are coming!

05:48.413 --> 05:50.332
I have noticed this!

05:57.422 --> 06:00.634
You are... quite strong.

06:00.717 --> 06:02.511
Eh. I eat a lot of ham.

06:03.846 --> 06:07.098
Say, Pajuna, what kind of soup
are you serving today?

06:07.265 --> 06:10.059
Cream of mushroom.
My own recipe.

06:10.143 --> 06:13.396
I grow the mushrooms
on a large heap of cow pies.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.608
Oh, soup and pie!
That sounds delicious.

06:16.692 --> 06:17.984
May I help myself?

06:18.151 --> 06:20.612
You don't know what cow pies are, do you?

06:20.696 --> 06:23.866
Do not open the door!
You will let the bees in!

06:24.073 --> 06:26.576
Is that what I look like when I am afraid?

06:26.660 --> 06:27.494
Mm-hm.

06:28.411 --> 06:29.705
That is so sad.

06:29.913 --> 06:31.122
I am not afraid.

06:31.206 --> 06:34.417
I'm merely cautious about the bees
because they will kill us

06:34.501 --> 06:36.753
with their terrible stingers
full of poison!

06:48.724 --> 06:49.974
Ah!

06:50.058 --> 06:50.893
Oh.

06:51.059 --> 06:52.227
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:52.310 --> 06:54.771
The stingers...
they are relentless.

07:09.703 --> 07:13.540
Oh, my gosh, these bees are terrifying.
Aren't they, Puss?

07:15.625 --> 07:16.585
Puss?

07:20.171 --> 07:24.384
It is really quite cozy in here.
We had a room like this where I grew up.

07:24.467 --> 07:27.679
Only it was small and instead of treasure,
it held our clothes

07:27.763 --> 07:29.180
when we were not wearing them.

07:29.347 --> 07:32.141
Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Puss.

07:32.308 --> 07:35.353
Fear? I do not know
the meaning of the word "fear."

07:35.478 --> 07:38.899
I've never heard this noun
that indicates a distressing emotion

07:38.982 --> 07:43.612
aroused by impending danger, whether
the threat is real or imagined.

07:45.405 --> 07:47.797
You sure? Everything you're
doing makes it seem like...

07:47.832 --> 07:49.868
<i>I am sorry, I cannot hear
what you are saying</i>

07:49.952 --> 07:53.956
<i>because I am extremely interested
in this goblet. What craftsmanship!</i>

07:54.038 --> 07:57.626
Puss, bees are harmless.
Let me show you.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.672
I'm in an incredible amount of pain.

08:05.467 --> 08:09.679
All right. We must find a way
to drive the bees from San Lorenzo.

08:09.763 --> 08:13.224
Now, if hypothetically,
I were afraid,

08:13.391 --> 08:16.728
perhaps I would deal with it
the way the mayor does.

08:26.195 --> 08:29.449
This is not working.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.419
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:52.388 --> 08:55.099
Plan B:
We will all move to a new town.

08:55.266 --> 08:56.893
What?
- We cannot do that!

08:56.977 --> 08:59.437
I have too many things buried around here.

08:59.562 --> 09:02.983
Uh, just ordinary innocent things

09:03.066 --> 09:05.735
that definitely are not
evidence of crimes.

09:05.819 --> 09:07.529
I am afraid of other towns!

09:07.612 --> 09:10.615
We can't leave San Lorenzo, Puss.
It's our home.

09:10.782 --> 09:12.701
You are right, of course.

09:12.784 --> 09:15.328
There must be some way
to get rid of those bees.

09:32.178 --> 09:34.222
Like, hi!

09:37.392 --> 09:42.564
I'm the Piper,
but you can call me... the... Piper?

09:44.482 --> 09:48.528
Whoa, I thought I was going somewhere else
with that sentence, man.

09:48.778 --> 09:49.946
What do you want?

09:50.697 --> 09:52.866
I can get rid of those bees for you.

09:52.949 --> 09:54.492
You are my new best friend.

09:54.576 --> 09:58.538
I... I mean, this sounds excellent.
- Hang on, Puss.

09:58.747 --> 10:01.708
How do we know we can trust
this Pied Piper?

10:01.958 --> 10:03.459
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:03.543 --> 10:05.837
I'm not the Pied Piper.

10:05.921 --> 10:08.131
That guy is a total sellout.

10:08.214 --> 10:10.050
I'm just the Piper.

10:10.550 --> 10:12.677
What do you know about the bees?

10:14.178 --> 10:16.180
So much, baby brother man.

10:16.264 --> 10:20.643
I can totally get those bees to beat it
with my magic flute.

10:22.437 --> 10:24.940
Whoa! How'd that get there?

10:26.274 --> 10:28.110
Ha, there it is!

10:33.406 --> 10:35.241
This is the perfect solution.

10:35.324 --> 10:37.660
So, should she begin at once or sooner?

10:37.827 --> 10:40.538
What sort of payment are you expecting?

10:40.705 --> 10:43.792
Oh, you know,
I'm just looking for a little bread.

10:44.042 --> 10:47.045
Oh, well, we do have an excellent bakery
here in San Lorenzo,

10:47.129 --> 10:48.212
but I don't know if...

10:48.296 --> 10:49.380
No, no, no. It is settled.

10:49.464 --> 10:52.425
Get rid of the bees, and you can have
all the bread you want.

10:52.634 --> 10:56.054
Far out, man.
This is gonna be a trip!

10:56.138 --> 10:58.431
Thank you so much.
This is excellent.

10:58.598 --> 10:59.975
Please, get rid of those bees.

11:00.058 --> 11:02.435
I would do it myself,
but you are already here,

11:02.518 --> 11:06.522
and I have quite a bit on my
schedule today, you understand. Goodbye.

11:45.269 --> 11:46.688
Our hero!

11:47.063 --> 11:48.773
The Piper saved us!

11:48.940 --> 11:52.027
I am not used to being
on this end of applause.

11:52.110 --> 11:56.489
Is it like this?
I just slap my paws together like so?

11:57.073 --> 11:58.658
Hey, man.

11:58.741 --> 12:02.037
It's time for me to collect my bread,
baby brother man.

12:02.662 --> 12:03.830
Ah, yes.

12:03.913 --> 12:08.626
If you follow me to the bakery,
we have a fine selection of baked goods.

12:09.836 --> 12:12.463
You're bumming me out, boss man.

12:12.630 --> 12:14.340
I don't want your food.

12:15.258 --> 12:17.426
I'm talking about bread here.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.429
Bread, man. Dough!

12:21.014 --> 12:24.559
You want your bread uncooked?

12:24.642 --> 12:28.646
I did something for you,
now you do something for me.

12:31.774 --> 12:34.819
Oh. I think she wants money.

12:35.028 --> 12:39.782
This cat digs it. I'd say half the loot
in your Treasure House makes us even.

12:39.866 --> 12:41.868
Half the treasure?
There is no way!

12:41.951 --> 12:46.164
I am afraid that taking our treasure
is out of the question.

12:47.415 --> 12:49.167
That's too bad.

12:50.043 --> 12:52.503
Looks like I'm gonna have to
bring the bees back.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.463
What? No!

12:54.589 --> 12:57.675
This is gonna be a real buzzkill.

13:24.202 --> 13:25.745
What is that?

13:25.995 --> 13:30.666
Guess you don't know about
a little thing called bee lightning!

13:33.002 --> 13:35.588
<i>Children!</i>

13:45.348 --> 13:47.309
This, I do not like!

13:58.569 --> 14:01.072
Felina, protect me!

14:06.202 --> 14:08.330
This, I do not like.

14:10.581 --> 14:13.376
The Piper must be running
a protection racket.

14:13.918 --> 14:14.919
What is that?

14:15.003 --> 14:17.588
It is when someone offers
to protect you from a threat

14:17.672 --> 14:19.674
that they themselves
are responsible for.

14:19.757 --> 14:23.845
The Piper makes the bees attack towns,
then charges to get rid of them.

14:24.012 --> 14:24.929
What can we do?

14:25.013 --> 14:28.683
I may not be afraid of bees,
but I am afraid of that Piper.

14:28.808 --> 14:31.811
And giant bee balls, and cotton balls.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.437
Triangles. Cabbage.

14:33.521 --> 14:37.525
I know!
We can learn to like being stung.

14:37.608 --> 14:38.901
Who wants to practice?

14:38.985 --> 14:43.198
Ow! Ow! Ow! Mm...

14:43.281 --> 14:45.283
Please say you have an idea, Puss.

14:49.912 --> 14:53.124
If we could break her control of the bees,
I could fight her.

14:53.208 --> 14:56.211
There must be some way.

15:05.636 --> 15:07.389
That is it!

15:07.471 --> 15:10.516
We need a sound that will disrupt
the Piper's flute playing

15:10.599 --> 15:12.518
so that she loses control of the bees.

15:12.727 --> 15:15.813
Quick, what is the most annoying sound
in existence?

15:20.109 --> 15:21.569
Cleevil's gobflute.

15:21.736 --> 15:26.615
Ugh, yes. It's enough to sour your milk.
- I think Cleevil is in the orphanage.

15:26.699 --> 15:28.284
Who's going to go get her?

15:32.997 --> 15:36.459
Hm? No!
The mayor is not afraid of bees.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.628
No, but I am terrified of flutes. Mommy!

15:40.755 --> 15:43.674
I know that I must
be the one who goes, but...

15:43.758 --> 15:47.053
I have a strange feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

15:47.136 --> 15:50.432
I feel hot,
and my mouth... is so dry.

15:50.639 --> 15:54.102
Ha. And you keep feeling
like you have to go to the bathroom?

15:54.185 --> 15:55.895
And your knees are rubbery?

15:56.104 --> 15:58.022
Yes! What does that mean?

15:58.273 --> 15:59.982
I feel that way all the time!

16:00.066 --> 16:01.443
It is fear.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.569
It cannot be fear.

16:04.695 --> 16:05.780
But it is.

16:06.655 --> 16:10.659
I, Puss in Boots, am afraid.

16:10.743 --> 16:12.036
It's okay, Puss.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.038
You just have to face your fear.

16:15.290 --> 16:16.999
I know you can do it.

16:18.793 --> 16:22.046
I can face my fear, and I will.

16:22.130 --> 16:24.632
I will retrieve Cleevil
from the orphanage.

16:24.715 --> 16:28.094
If I run fast enough,
no bee can catch me.

16:28.844 --> 16:31.806
Puss, no.
Bees respond to movement.

16:31.889 --> 16:34.683
You have to go slowly
so they won't attack.

16:34.767 --> 16:38.813
Be calm. Calm and slow.

16:38.896 --> 16:41.524
Okay, whatever you do, don't freak out.
- No, I...

16:41.732 --> 16:43.651
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

16:47.405 --> 16:50.116
I am... kind of freaking out.

17:10.678 --> 17:12.555
I cannot stand the slow!

17:18.019 --> 17:18.853
Ow!

17:19.854 --> 17:21.189
I am stung!

17:21.939 --> 17:26.319
What inconsiderate fool
left this cactus here? Oh, it was me.

17:26.861 --> 17:32.450
Okay. Calm and slow.
Calm and slow.

17:32.783 --> 17:34.243
Keep it together, Puss.

17:34.327 --> 17:35.537
You can do this.

18:09.695 --> 18:12.156
Puss, I'm so glad you're here!

18:12.240 --> 18:13.949
Puss is here to save us!

18:14.033 --> 18:15.910
What are you gonna do about the bees?

18:15.993 --> 18:19.330
Did you know that bees can count to ten
but not to nine?

18:20.081 --> 18:22.417
Where is Cleevil?
- She went to the cantina.

18:22.584 --> 18:24.627
Said something about mushroom soup.

18:24.793 --> 18:27.796
She went back out there?
All the way to the cantina?

18:27.880 --> 18:31.384
Yeah! As soon as I told her
mushrooms grow on cow pies,

18:31.467 --> 18:33.511
she really wanted some.

18:33.719 --> 18:36.972
I don't think she knows what cow pies are.

18:48.526 --> 18:50.945
Puss, are you here to try the soup?

18:51.862 --> 18:54.949
No, thank you.
Cleevil, I need you to play your gobflute.

18:55.157 --> 18:57.243
On purpose?
- Yes.

18:57.326 --> 19:00.538
Please come, we must hurry.
You will save the entire town.

19:00.622 --> 19:02.540
Mm-hm.
One problem.

19:02.624 --> 19:04.959
I left my gobflute back at the orphanage.
- Huh?

19:05.042 --> 19:07.336
I didn't want to get soup on it.

19:12.174 --> 19:13.342
<i>Let us go.</i>

19:18.347 --> 19:20.808
Did you bring back soup?

19:20.891 --> 19:23.060
No, we have come for the gobflute.

19:23.144 --> 19:25.854
I am not going back for soup!

19:27.690 --> 19:30.818
Should I start warming up, Puss?

19:30.985 --> 19:32.153
<i>No!</i>

19:45.708 --> 19:48.169
Ha, you think you can take me on?

19:48.461 --> 19:51.547
Let's see what you've got,
little flower!

19:57.803 --> 20:01.140
Bad vibrations, man!

20:09.440 --> 20:11.150
Play, Cleevil. Play!

20:27.750 --> 20:29.793
Cleevil, you can do it!

20:32.254 --> 20:33.631
Look! Elephant-monkeys!

20:34.549 --> 20:35.550
My favorite!

20:36.133 --> 20:37.259
Oh, no!

20:37.385 --> 20:38.553
Cheater!

20:38.761 --> 20:41.723
You thought you could outplay me?

20:41.805 --> 20:44.475
I'm the Piper, man.

20:44.559 --> 20:46.018
The Piper!

20:53.192 --> 20:54.068
No!

20:55.444 --> 20:59.907
Bees! I would have words with you.
The mayor will translate.

21:01.325 --> 21:02.243
Uh, hello.

21:04.912 --> 21:07.623
We must unite against our common foe.

21:10.084 --> 21:13.045
The Piper has enslaved you for too long.

21:13.295 --> 21:16.298
The time has come
for you to take your freedom.

21:16.465 --> 21:18.467
You can ignore me, you can sting me,

21:18.676 --> 21:22.096
but you know in your hearts
who your true enemy is.

21:22.304 --> 21:24.932
You know what you must do.

21:25.015 --> 21:27.393
Also, please do not sting me.

21:35.526 --> 21:38.112
What? I thought you were afraid of bees.

21:40.406 --> 21:42.283
That's my gobflute!

21:42.908 --> 21:43.909
<i>Ha-ha-ha!</i>

21:44.201 --> 21:47.329
Now it is you
who should be afraid of the bees.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.250
Whoa. Bummer!

22:02.886 --> 22:04.806
<i>Yay, Puss!</i>

22:12.814 --> 22:13.856
Whoo-hoo!

22:14.106 --> 22:15.608
<i>I'm proud of you, Puss.</i>

22:15.691 --> 22:18.486
You faced your fear,
like a true hero.

22:18.694 --> 22:20.967
Ah, bees are nothing to be afraid of.

22:20.968 --> 22:23.240
They are just friendly little insects.

22:23.324 --> 22:25.868
The swarm is coming back!

22:28.746 --> 22:31.123
Classic.
