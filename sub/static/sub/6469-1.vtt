02:24.894 --> 02:26.145
How's it going, fellas?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.355
- Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?

02:28.356 --> 02:29.982
All right.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.776
Comfortable?

02:32.777 --> 02:34.862
Uh, yeah.
Sure.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.990
Okay. Question one.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.742
Have you ever talked
to a psychiatrist

02:40.743 --> 02:43.328
or a psychologist
about an emotional problem?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.038
Uh, no.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.541
Nice.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.169
Have you ever felt
you needed help

02:50.170 --> 02:52.379
with an emotional problem?

02:54.340 --> 02:55.716
Uh...

02:57.594 --> 02:59.428
No.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.097
Have you ever attempted
to kill yourself?

03:03.975 --> 03:05.851
Wow.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.103
Uh, no.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.564
No.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.817
In the past year, have you
consumed any alcohol or...

03:13.818 --> 03:15.027
- Yes.
- Illegal drugs?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.862
Illegal drugs?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.489
Um, yes.

03:19.490 --> 03:22.117
Do... is this...
this is going on record?

03:22.118 --> 03:25.454
If I say "no,"
that means that I can be in it?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.747
Not necessarily.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.498
It's $15 a day?

03:28.499 --> 03:29.625
- Yeah.
- That's correct.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.918
No, I haven't had any alcohol

03:30.919 --> 03:32.669
or anything like that.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.131
Have you ever given in to
an aggressive urge or impulse?

03:36.132 --> 03:38.759
Uh, what do you mean by that?

03:38.760 --> 03:42.429
Like, domestic violence
or rape, incest...

03:42.430 --> 03:44.598
- No, no, no, no.
- Things of that nature.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.099
- No.
- No.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.727
I go to Stanford.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.687
Okay.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.232
Have you ever experienced
any emotional problems

03:53.233 --> 03:55.317
associated with
your sexual interests

03:55.318 --> 03:57.402
or your choice of
a sexual partner?

03:57.403 --> 03:59.279
Does love count?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.906
If you'd like it to.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.533
Okay, then no.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.702
Why do you want to
participate in this study?

04:05.703 --> 04:07.788
To be honest,
financial gain.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.164
I could use a little cash
this summer.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.833
I just saw the $15 a day.

04:11.834 --> 04:15.963
I was looking through the ads,
and it was just...

04:15.964 --> 04:18.464
the most interesting.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.675
If selected for
this study,

04:19.676 --> 04:22.261
would you rather be
a guard or a prisoner?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.347
I don't think I have
the qualities to be a guard.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.974
Prisoner.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.934
Prisoner, I guess.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.811
I-I wouldn't want to be a guard.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.771
- Prisoner.
- A prisoner.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.189
Prisoner.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.525
A prisoner sounds like
it would be a little less work.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.527
Prisoner.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.113
Why's that?

04:43.908 --> 04:45.909
Nobody likes guards.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.417
All right,
we got a heads.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.793
So we can just put him
over there,

04:54.794 --> 04:56.336
yeah,
with the prisoners.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.884
Last one.
You want the honors?

05:12.103 --> 05:13.979
Heads again.
He's a prisoner.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.397
Okay, so the last
one's a guard.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.524
Exactly.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.943
Well, guys,

05:19.944 --> 05:22.321
I think we have our prisoners
and our guards.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.079
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.664
I am Dr. Phil Zimbardo,

05:32.665 --> 05:35.584
professor of psychology
here at Stanford University.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.544
Welcome to orientation.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.962
You're gonna be
very pleased to know

05:38.963 --> 05:42.591
that you all have been chosen
to be the prison guards

05:42.592 --> 05:44.885
in this study.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.846
And that choice was made based
upon the exemplary qualities

05:47.847 --> 05:51.641
that you all demonstrated
during your interviews.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.393
So good for you.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.483
This experiment will be
an extension of my research

05:59.484 --> 06:03.278
into the effects prisons
can have on human behavior.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.405
And being that it's summer
and the school's almost empty,

06:05.406 --> 06:08.950
we should have near complete
privacy for this study.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.244
And as you'll soon see,

06:11.245 --> 06:13.622
we have cleared out
some of the teachers' offices

06:13.623 --> 06:15.540
and converted them
into prison cells,

06:15.541 --> 06:18.043
and the hallway will serve
as the prison yard.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.420
But remember,

06:20.421 --> 06:22.964
just as you are watching
the prisoners,

06:22.965 --> 06:27.844
my graduate staff and I
will be watching you.

06:27.845 --> 06:32.557
So under no circumstances
whatsoever are you to hit

06:32.558 --> 06:36.019
or physically assault
the prisoners in any way.

06:36.020 --> 06:40.148
Now, you'll all be given
sunglasses and uniforms

06:40.149 --> 06:41.817
to give the prisoners a sense

06:41.818 --> 06:46.238
of a unified,
singular authority.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.866
Once a prisoner is jailed,
he will not be able to leave,

06:49.867 --> 06:52.744
except under
established procedures.

06:54.205 --> 06:57.290
And from this point forward,

06:57.291 --> 06:59.292
you should never refer
to this as a study

06:59.293 --> 07:01.128
or an experiment again.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.591
A lot of these books,

07:06.592 --> 07:08.343
I don't even know
where I got them.

07:08.344 --> 07:12.013
The perils of
moving in together.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.266
What are you
thinking about?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.684
The experiment?

07:15.685 --> 07:17.477
No, experiment's routine.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.354
You know, I'm gonna be away
for two weeks,

07:19.355 --> 07:21.231
and then...

07:22.608 --> 07:25.444
And then you are
gonna be starting

07:25.445 --> 07:27.028
your new job.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.364
You make it sound like
it's in a different state.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.283
Berkeley is an hour
up the road.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.576
Oh, that I know.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.161
It's just I don't know
what the guys and I

07:34.162 --> 07:35.787
are gonna do without you.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.541
Phil...

07:40.585 --> 07:43.420
No one's ever gonna
take me seriously and...

07:43.421 --> 07:45.589
and my career seriously

07:45.590 --> 07:49.217
until I go out there
and prove it on my own.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.971
Hey...

07:54.348 --> 07:57.058
It could have been
New York.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.061
I made this decision
for us.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.063
I know.
I know.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.190
I know.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.316
It's just...

08:07.695 --> 08:10.447
You know what?

08:10.448 --> 08:12.574
Nobody deserves this
more than you.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.413
You were a great
student of mine.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.129
And you're gonna be
a great professor.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.006
Thank you.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.681
Now wait a second.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.058
You did miss a spot
right over there.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.226
Hey!

08:39.227 --> 08:40.559
You can't fall for that.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.062
Come on!

08:42.063 --> 08:44.356
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.404
Hey. You Daniel Culp?

08:51.405 --> 08:52.614
Uh, yeah.
That's...

08:52.615 --> 08:53.740
That's the name
they gave me.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.283
I'm placing you
under arrest

08:55.284 --> 08:57.702
for violation of
California Penal Code 211,

08:57.703 --> 08:58.745
armed robbery.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.163
Hey, my brother
didn't do anything.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.374
Uh, they know that.
Everything will be fine.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.292
Go‒go on, tell Mom
I won't be home for dinner.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.835
She'll understand.
It's okay.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.504
Hands on the car and spread 'em.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.311
Which one of us
should start?

10:04.312 --> 10:05.854
Well, I'll do it.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.900
Okay,

10:10.901 --> 10:12.485
feet apart.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.406
Wider.
I said "wider."

10:16.407 --> 10:17.866
You guys,
this doesn't have to be...

10:17.867 --> 10:19.618
Just keep your hands
on the wall.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.746
Okay, just keep your hands
on the wall.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.165
Um, put your head down.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.669
Uh, and take off
your shoes.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.010
Uh...

10:37.011 --> 10:38.678
Oh, oh.
Okay.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.138
Um...

10:41.766 --> 10:43.391
Put your hands
at your sides.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.105
Now I want you to strip.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.316
Uh, really?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.901
Maybe I could have
some privacy first...

10:52.902 --> 10:54.361
Shut up!

10:54.362 --> 10:55.820
And strip.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.283
And put your clothes
on the floor.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.244
Oh, man.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.970
Put your clothes
to the right.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.722
The shirt.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.976
Don't we have
to delouse him first?

11:26.977 --> 11:28.228
Oh, shit.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.771
Uh, stay where you are.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.356
Ah, oh.
Right.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.735
Jesse.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.611
Ah.

12:18.612 --> 12:19.863
You made it.
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.906
- Yeah.
- Very, very, very good.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.616
Uh, everybody,
this is Jesse Fletcher.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.910
He's gonna consult with us
on the experiment.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.788
We got Paul, Kyle,
and you remember Mike.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.831
- Hey.
- Yep.

12:29.832 --> 12:30.874
Hi.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.001
Why don't you
pull up a chair?

12:38.424 --> 12:39.424
What?
Why me?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.134
Just do it.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.677
All right.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.554
Put your arms
above your head.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.448
Fuck.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.838
Wow.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.266
Hey, Phil,
um,

13:30.267 --> 13:31.309
I don't mean to be rude,

13:31.310 --> 13:34.354
but what qualifies him
to be here?

13:38.359 --> 13:40.527
Well, he's got experience.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.495
You're kidding, right?

13:50.496 --> 13:52.372
Okay, boys,
let's take her down there

13:52.373 --> 13:54.499
and show her
just how pretty she looks.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.343
All right, listen up.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.096
From now on, you will be known
as Prisoner 8612

14:08.097 --> 14:09.973
and only as 8612.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.641
And you will,
at all times,

14:11.642 --> 14:14.561
refer to us
as Mr. Correctional Officer.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.854
You got it?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.856
Uh, yeah,
I got it.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.148
What was that?

14:20.526 --> 14:23.403
I mean, yes, sir,
Mr. Correctional Officer, sir.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.821
Yeah, good.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.406
All right,
um,

14:26.407 --> 14:28.616
let's take her down
to cell number two.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.541
All right.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.668
Let's get the next one.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.601
Hey.
What are you doing in here?

14:54.602 --> 14:55.935
You're missing everything.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.815
What?

15:00.816 --> 15:04.569
You brought me here
to legitimize this experiment,

15:04.570 --> 15:07.697
and there's nothing legitimate
about this place, Phil.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.868
You're right.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.786
You're right.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.413
I didn't explain it well.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.207
Prisons, they represent...

15:18.208 --> 15:21.044
a loss of freedom,
literally

15:21.045 --> 15:24.088
and symbolically.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.132
Yeah, but that does not explain
why they're wearing dresses.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.842
They're wearing dresses,
Phil.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.763
Yes, I understand.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.431
Uh...

15:34.516 --> 15:37.310
We're trying to strip away
their individuality...

15:39.939 --> 15:42.190
Make them uniform,
feminize them.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.483
Feminize them?

15:43.484 --> 15:45.068
Yes.
Feminize them.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.987
Take away all the things

15:47.988 --> 15:51.240
that make them them.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.370
You see, we're trying
to understand

15:55.371 --> 15:57.747
how an institution

15:57.748 --> 15:59.874
affects an individual's
behavior.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.963
We're trying to do something...

16:04.964 --> 16:07.256
We're trying to do
something good.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.356
Hey, man.
I'm Daniel.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.691
Uh, that's Jeff.

16:24.692 --> 16:25.733
Hey.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.986
- I'm... I'm Peter.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.278
Well, nice to meet you,
comrade.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.530
What are you in for?

16:30.531 --> 16:31.823
Uh...

16:31.824 --> 16:33.366
they said something
about burglary,

16:33.367 --> 16:34.701
but, uh,

16:34.702 --> 16:36.119
I mean, I didn't really
do anything.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.370
Sure, sure.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.997
Joint's overflowing
with innocent men.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.915
We've been framed...
framed, I tell ya!

16:40.916 --> 16:43.376
I'm just messing with you.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.628
You can sit down, you know.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.005
Yeah.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.759
Are you aware we're
supposed to be quiet?

16:52.636 --> 16:54.637
Yeah, you are aware
they can't lay a finger on us.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.764
It's in the contract.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.225
We can do whatever we want.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.394
I'm just saying I think
it'll go a whole lot smoother

17:01.395 --> 17:02.478
if we do what we're told.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.273
Okay!

17:06.275 --> 17:08.026
Time for lineup!

17:44.396 --> 17:47.523
Prisoners are part of
a correctional community.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.734
In order to keep the community
running smoothly,

17:49.735 --> 17:53.321
prisoners must obey
the following rules.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.906
Rule number one:

17:54.907 --> 17:57.492
prisoners must remain silent
during rest periods,

17:57.493 --> 17:59.535
after lights out,
during meals,

17:59.536 --> 18:02.288
and outside the prison yards.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.040
Rule number two:

18:04.041 --> 18:05.917
prisoners must eat at meal times

18:05.918 --> 18:08.169
and only at meal times.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.295
Rule number three:

18:09.296 --> 18:14.175
prisoners must participate
in all prison activities.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.718
Rule number four:

18:15.719 --> 18:17.011
prisoners must address
the guards

18:17.012 --> 18:18.930
as Mr. Correctional Officer

18:18.931 --> 18:22.391
and the warden as Mr. Chief
Correctional Officer.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.726
- Rule number five...
- You're on, Mike.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.853
Smoking is a privilege.
Rule number six...

18:25.854 --> 18:29.190
You can call me, uh,
Warden from here on.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.859
Hey, maybe tell the guards
to lighten up a bit.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.320
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't do that.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.030
Rule number eight:
prisoners must report...

18:36.031 --> 18:37.490
All right.
Don't interfere.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.909
All rule violations
to the guards.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.494
Rule number nine:

18:41.495 --> 18:43.871
failure to obey
any of the above rules

18:43.872 --> 18:46.249
may result in punishment.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.880
All right,
stand at attention

18:52.881 --> 18:54.507
for Warden Penny.

19:00.222 --> 19:03.141
All of you have shown

19:03.142 --> 19:07.520
that you are unable to function
in the real world.

19:07.521 --> 19:11.232
You lack the responsibility
of the good people

19:11.233 --> 19:13.609
of this great country.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.863
Well, we are here
to help you learn

19:16.864 --> 19:19.240
what your responsibilities are.

19:19.241 --> 19:22.827
Now, if you follow the rules
and keep your hands clean,

19:22.828 --> 19:24.704
if you repent for your misdeeds

19:24.705 --> 19:28.249
and show a proper attitude
of penitence,

19:28.250 --> 19:31.544
well, we'll get along just fine,
gentlemen.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.387
- How is it in there?
- It's fine.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.014
Prisoners are falling in line.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.891
Yeah, we kind of did
all the hard work for you.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.601
I can almost smell the pork.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.228
Better pork than
wearing a dress, dude.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.153
You know who
you look like?

19:57.154 --> 20:00.573
You look like that guy
from Cool Hand Luke.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.284
You know, the one that kills
Paul Newman at the end?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.536
Haven't seen the film.
Thanks for ruining it, man.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.663
Oh, it's a great flick.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.957
I'm partial to Captain
myself.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.961
Now, I can be a nice guy,

20:13.962 --> 20:17.632
or I can be one real mean
son of a bitch.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.343
It's all up to you.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.981
Oh, we should strike
for better food.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.027
And more money.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.321
Just eat your food,
8612.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.240
Keep your comments
to yourself.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.138
Hey, man.
Can I have a smoke?

21:06.139 --> 21:07.807
Oh, yeah.

21:20.570 --> 21:24.282
Smoking is a privilege,
5704,

21:24.283 --> 21:26.951
one you're gonna
have to earn.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.995
It says in the contract,
after mealtime...

21:28.996 --> 21:31.289
As for the rest
of you prisoners...

21:33.208 --> 21:36.377
I need not remind you
of rule number one.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.715
I don't want
any more talking.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.716
Uh-oh.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.925
Look at this guy.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.677
Thinks he's John Wayne
or something.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.348
- Jesus.
- What the fuck, man?

21:49.349 --> 21:52.143
That means you, 8612.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.978
You got that?

21:59.943 --> 22:02.695
Okay, is it just me,
or...

22:02.696 --> 22:04.947
Are these guys taking this thing
a bit too seriously?

22:04.948 --> 22:06.365
Uh, yeah.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.992
They're just doing
their job.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.035
Same as us.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.536
Uh, really?

22:10.537 --> 22:12.830
'Cause it seems to me like
they're having more fun

22:12.831 --> 22:14.665
twirling their batons
than I'm having

22:14.666 --> 22:16.751
with my balls hanging out
of this fucking dress.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.085
This isn't about fun.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.170
This is a job.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.546
Yeah, but for 15 bucks?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.173
Yeah, 15 bucks
that I really need.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.257
Yeah, we all need it,

22:23.258 --> 22:25.092
but why should we be working
twice as hard for it

22:25.093 --> 22:26.385
than these guys?

22:26.386 --> 22:30.222
I'm thinking we need to make
the guards earn their pay.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.769
Visiting day is in two days.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.854
We would like to give you
the opportunity

22:36.855 --> 22:38.272
to write a letter to the person

22:38.273 --> 22:39.899
that you would like to have
come visit.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.484
Isn't that nice?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.027
In 30 minutes,

22:43.028 --> 22:46.197
you will be required
to turn in a finished letter.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.617
Do not seal the envelope.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.160
Whether or not
your letter gets sent

22:51.161 --> 22:52.787
will be based
on your behavior.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.330
Are there any questions?

22:54.331 --> 22:56.374
I have a question,
Mr. Chief Correctional Officer.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.918
Uh, will we be allowed
one phone call?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.544
No, you will not.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.213
Oh, yeah...

23:02.214 --> 23:04.632
Question, 5486?

23:04.633 --> 23:05.716
I...

23:05.717 --> 23:07.593
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Chief
Correctional Officer,

23:07.594 --> 23:09.845
um, my glasses...

23:09.846 --> 23:11.347
What about them?

23:11.348 --> 23:14.058
Well, I...
I mean, need them to see.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.184
Wha...

23:15.185 --> 23:17.645
Your correctional staff
is here to serve you, 5486.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.927
- Right, it's just I get...
- You don't need your glasses.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.316
Don't interrupt
the warden, boy.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.864
Mr. Correctional Officer,

23:28.865 --> 23:30.991
when will we know
our sentence?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.034
When judgment
is passed on you.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.619
And when will that be?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.663
Well, that is for the judge
and the court to determine.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.789
When are we gonna
go to court?

23:36.790 --> 23:40.960
That is also for the judge
and the court to determine.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.881
Uh, Mr. Correctional Officer,
sir, uh, my pills...

23:45.882 --> 23:47.049
I need my pills...

23:47.050 --> 23:49.844
I wasn't aware that
you took medication, 3401.

23:49.845 --> 23:53.514
Uh, well, they're vitamins,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.809
Well, you get all
the vitamins you need

23:56.810 --> 23:59.854
in the tasty, nutritious
food we serve you, 3401.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.398
- Yes, but...
- That's enough chin-wagging.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.733
Let's get to writing those
letters, ladies.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.102
No, nothing so far.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.979
"I'll do my best to organize
the other prisoners

24:41.980 --> 24:44.064
and bring an end
to this oppressive situation."

24:44.065 --> 24:45.357
Signed, "Power to the people."

24:45.358 --> 24:47.985
Well, clearly, he's not
taking this very seriously.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.698
Hey.
Check this one out.

24:54.451 --> 24:55.743
Look how he signed it.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.665
Jesus.
It's only been ten hours.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.959
This might be an interesting
two weeks after all.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.669
Mm-hmm.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.341
Let's go, boys.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.927
All right, gentlemen,

25:12.928 --> 25:15.137
we gonna have ourselves
a little count.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.139
Gonna be a lot of fun.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.809
Okay, 5704, go.
Loud and clear.

25:20.810 --> 25:23.145
5704.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.355
3401.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.357
- 7258.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.900
Is that loud and clear?

25:28.693 --> 25:31.445
Maybe you didn't hear me right.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.906
Loud and clear.

25:33.907 --> 25:34.990
Go.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.076
5704.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.244
3401.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.496
- 7258.
- 819.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.997
- 1037.
- Stop!

25:41.998 --> 25:44.708
1037, you don't know
your own name?

25:44.709 --> 25:46.877
Why'd you have to
look down?

25:46.878 --> 25:48.420
'Cause I didn't know
my number.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.172
- You didn't know your number?
- No, sir.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.632
You know your name now, boy?

25:51.633 --> 25:52.841
Yes, sir.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.885
- What's your number?
- 1037.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.638
Then, 1037, don't look down
at your dress next time.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.014
Start again.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.809
- Faster.
- 5704.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.144
- 3401.
- 7258.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.021
When I say, "Again, faster,"

26:06.022 --> 26:08.315
I expect you to go again,
faster.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.235
5704, go again. Faster.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.195
- 5704.
- 3401.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.155
- 7258.
- 819.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.241
- 1037.
- 8612.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.368
- 2093.
- Uh, 5486.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.869
4325.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.664
Now, that was terrible.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.916
Maybe them caps on your heads

26:25.917 --> 26:27.626
are a little too tight,
gentlemen,

26:27.627 --> 26:29.795
'cause that was slow as hell.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.130
Since you guys
can't go forwards,

26:31.131 --> 26:33.173
how about we try
going backwards?

26:36.553 --> 26:37.636
407...

26:37.637 --> 26:38.887
No, God damn it.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.097
I said backwards.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.516
Starting with him.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.059
4325.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.353
- 5486.
- 2093.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.105
Uh, 86‒
Fuck!

26:48.106 --> 26:49.773
Excuse me, 8612?

26:49.774 --> 26:51.775
Did you use profanity?

26:51.776 --> 26:53.694
Yes, I did,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.407
Well, just for that, you have
to start all over again.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.492
- 4‒
- Because of you.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.703
That's right, don't interrupt
Mr. Correctional Officer.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.371
Go, 4325.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.999
- 4325.
- Uh, 5486.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.084
- 2093.
- 8612.

27:09.085 --> 27:11.045
- 1037.
- 819.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.963
- 7258.
- 3401.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.007
- 5704.
- Tell you what you're gonna do.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.176
Tell you what we're gonna do.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.887
I got a great idea.
How about we try singing it?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.513
That'll get the blood boiling
a little bit.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.223
5704, go!

27:23.224 --> 27:24.725
I know you got it.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.144
I know you got a set
of lungs on you, 5704.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.274
I see any smiling,
it's jumping jacks.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.985
Go.

Y'all find that funny?

28:05.725 --> 28:07.101
Y'all think this is funny.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.228
This ain't no Romper Room.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.813
Since y'all find this
so amusing,

28:10.814 --> 28:12.773
how about you come on out here
and give me ten jumping jacks,

28:12.774 --> 28:13.982
all y'all at the same time?

28:13.983 --> 28:15.025
Count 'em off.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.194
And sing it loud and clear.

28:18.613 --> 28:21.990
- Ten jumping jacks. Let's go.
- ♪ One, two, three ♪

28:21.991 --> 28:24.952
♪ Four, five, six ♪

28:24.953 --> 28:26.912
♪ Seven, eight ♪

28:26.913 --> 28:28.455
♪ Nine, ten ♪

28:30.125 --> 28:33.168
This John Wayne guy
is remarkable.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.378
From the second
he stepped in the yard,

28:34.379 --> 28:35.879
he's been in complete control.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.465
He's just doing his job.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.387
- 5704.
- 3401.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.638
7258.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.932
- 1037.
- 8612.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.809
- 2093.
- 5486.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.102
4325.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.562
No.
Now count it like you mean it.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.272
- 5704.
- 3401.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.606
- 7258.
- 819.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.608
- 1037.
- 8612.

28:56.609 --> 28:58.360
- 2093.
- 5486.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.445
4325.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.905
I want it fast,
I want it loud,

29:01.906 --> 29:03.031
and I want it clear.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.616
5704!

29:04.617 --> 29:06.785
- 3401!
- 7258!

29:06.786 --> 29:08.203
- 819!
- 1037!

29:08.204 --> 29:09.705
- 8612!
- 2093!

29:09.706 --> 29:12.207
- 5486!
- 4325.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.627
That was pretty,

29:15.628 --> 29:17.254
real pretty.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.214
That's how
we want it done.

29:21.384 --> 29:24.011
What are you so proud about,
7258?

29:26.806 --> 29:29.046
Tell me the number of the dress
to the man to your right.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.479
Don't look.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.063
No cheatin'.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.527
I couldn't tell you.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.279
I tell you what.
Why don't you come out here

29:42.280 --> 29:43.489
and give me ten
jumping jacks

29:43.490 --> 29:45.032
after you tell me
what number that is?

29:46.534 --> 29:48.619
3401.

29:50.663 --> 29:52.080
4325,

29:52.081 --> 29:54.875
tell me the number of the man
standing to your right.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.586
Um, 5486,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.297
Well, since
you had to look,

30:00.298 --> 30:01.715
I want you
to step up here,

30:01.716 --> 30:04.051
I want you to do
five push-ups,

30:04.052 --> 30:06.345
four jumping jacks,
then eight push-ups,

30:06.346 --> 30:07.596
then six jumping jacks

30:07.597 --> 30:09.431
so you will
remember the name

30:09.432 --> 30:11.016
of the man standing
to your right

30:11.017 --> 30:13.018
and you won't have
to look next time.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.479
Five push-ups.
There you go.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.733
One, two, three,

30:19.734 --> 30:22.486
four, five.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.283
One, two, three...

30:28.284 --> 30:29.409
Little less rattle there.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.953
Four.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.834
- One...
- All the way down now.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.293
- Three...
- There you go.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.546
- Four, five.
- That's a real man's push-up.

30:40.547 --> 30:44.341
Six, seven, eight.

30:48.054 --> 30:51.932
One, two, three, four,

30:51.933 --> 30:54.810
five, six.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.728
Get back in line.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.357
Did y'all enjoy your counts
this evening?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.068
No, sir.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.571
Who said that?

31:05.572 --> 31:08.198
- This one.
- 8612?

31:09.909 --> 31:12.286
What?
You want me to lie?

31:13.997 --> 31:16.874
Maybe you'd enjoy
a little time in the hole.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.635
Anybody else
not enjoy their counts?

31:30.054 --> 31:32.055
Anybody else want to be
honest here?

31:35.518 --> 31:37.060
Good.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.481
Hey, I, uh...

31:41.482 --> 31:43.483
I think one of us
needs to go home.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.776
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.903
We got another
two weeks of this.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.487
We need to pace ourselves.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.281
Fine.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.034
Have fun down here
in the dungeons of Jordan Hall.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.579
- See you later.
- Good night.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.247
Hey, Phil?

31:57.248 --> 31:59.291
You want to go
get some rest?

31:59.292 --> 32:00.876
Uh...

32:02.086 --> 32:04.254
No, I'm gonna stay here
a little bit more.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.638
Come on out of there, 8612.

32:15.683 --> 32:17.935
Get crackin', boy.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.937
Don't none of these other
prisoners get to sleep

32:19.938 --> 32:22.898
till you make your bed
to my satisfaction.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.278
Go on. Nice and tight.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.576
And I assure you,

32:34.577 --> 32:36.828
all of those other
prisoners are real tired

32:36.829 --> 32:38.830
from all those counts
you made 'em do.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.584
No wrinkles now.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.799
Oh, I hope you're not
done yet.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.343
I think your mama taught you
to make a better bed than that.

32:52.929 --> 32:53.971
Come on now.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.473
Don't disappoint
your mama, boy.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.725
Move those sheets.
Start over.

33:01.771 --> 33:04.898
I want those corners
nice and neat.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.734
John Wayne is a fag.

33:09.570 --> 33:11.196
What was that, 8612?

33:11.197 --> 33:13.073
Um, I'm sorry,
Mr. Correctional Officer?

33:13.074 --> 33:15.200
Did you just sass me, 8612?

33:15.201 --> 33:17.661
Um...
No? No.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.246
- Hmm.
- No, Mr. Correctional Officer.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.831
That's funny.
I could've sworn you did.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.541
That's so strange.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.209
Very strange.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.421
You know what?
Just the same, 8612,

33:27.422 --> 33:29.214
why don't you come on
out here in the hallway

33:29.215 --> 33:31.008
and give me 20 push-ups?

33:36.681 --> 33:38.432
Count 'em off
so everybody can hear them.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.893
One, two, three, four...

33:41.894 --> 33:46.273
- Louder.
- Five, six seven, eight...

33:46.274 --> 33:48.942
- Nine, ten...
- Don't touch his bed, 1037.

33:48.943 --> 33:51.403
- 11, 12...
- I see you.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.487
13, 14...

33:52.488 --> 33:53.989
I don't think
cell three can hear you.

33:53.990 --> 33:58.243
15, 16, 17, 18,

33:58.244 --> 34:00.787
19, 20.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.094
Well, are you ready
for me, 8612?

34:17.096 --> 34:19.264
Sure am,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.431
All right, now.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.911
I don't know, 8612.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.539
Them look like
hospital corners to you?

34:44.540 --> 34:46.875
How you guys doing?

34:46.876 --> 34:47.876
- Good.
- Yeah.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.043
- Good.
- Good.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.420
- I mean, we...
- How'd it... how'd it go?

34:51.422 --> 34:52.839
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.257
- Not too bad.

34:54.257 --> 34:55.550
I mean, we...

34:55.551 --> 34:56.842
We ran 'em pretty ragged.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.512
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.347
You should've seen
8612's face

35:00.348 --> 35:02.808
when I made him remake his bed
for the 12th time.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.142
Little fucker looked at me

35:04.143 --> 35:05.852
like I just took a shit
in his ice cream.

35:05.853 --> 35:06.895
Thought he was gonna
burst out crying

35:06.896 --> 35:08.271
right then and there.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.940
Yeah, I mean,
he might have.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.775
He's a pretty
emotional guy.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.693
- Nice.
- He got pretty upset.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.403
So they just, uh...

35:15.404 --> 35:17.030
they let you do it?

35:17.031 --> 35:19.032
Nobody steps in?

35:19.033 --> 35:21.409
Well, yeah, I mean, they don't
really have a choice, you know?

35:21.410 --> 35:22.661
Who's gonna step in?

35:22.662 --> 35:24.538
I mean,
you know,

35:24.539 --> 35:26.289
you're the boss man.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.499
Hell yeah.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.917
Wow.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.377
They got to do
what you say.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.712
Well, I guess we'll
have to give 8612

35:32.713 --> 35:34.256
a little extra
attention tonight.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.298
Mm-hmm.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.508
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.063
- Let's go!
- Come on!

35:50.064 --> 35:52.691
- Wake it up!
- Are you fucking kidding me?

35:52.692 --> 35:53.900
Hello!

35:53.901 --> 35:55.861
Hey.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.112
You hear that?

35:57.113 --> 35:59.197
Get out of there.

36:00.741 --> 36:02.242
- All right.
- Get the fuck out of bed!

36:02.243 --> 36:04.786
- Come on!
- Man.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.664
- We just finally got to sleep.
- Oh, no.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.416
We slept all day for this.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.209
Hands up.
Against the wall.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.752
Do it.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.254
Hey, give me that.

36:15.464 --> 36:18.967
Now, this
is an exercise period.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.802
Each prisoner must
complete the following:

36:20.803 --> 36:22.804
30 jump‒
Turn around.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.848
30 jumping jacks,
30 sit-ups,

36:24.849 --> 36:26.391
30 push-ups.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.518
It is up to
the guards' discretion

36:28.519 --> 36:30.937
whether or not a prisoner
shall do more.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.022
Well, hell,

36:32.023 --> 36:33.398
let's make it 40.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.443
Do 'em now.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.572
Hey, you heard the man.

36:40.573 --> 36:41.615
- Fuck!
- Come on!

36:41.616 --> 36:43.491
Jumping jacks,
sit-ups, push-ups.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.410
Get to it.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.411
Go!

36:46.412 --> 36:47.829
One, two, three...

36:58.591 --> 37:00.050
Keep going!

37:01.719 --> 37:05.305
- You only did six, 7258.
- I did at least seven.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.015
Yeah, good.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.817
You're finished when I say
you're finished, 819.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.152
Get back down.

37:20.363 --> 37:21.947
I did 40 push-ups.

37:21.948 --> 37:22.989
That's what you
told me to do.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.157
I did them.
I'm done.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.575
Hey, everybody
keeps going,

37:25.576 --> 37:27.744
unless 819 decides
to join you

37:27.745 --> 37:29.829
for an additional 20.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.083
What's it gonna be?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.125
You gonna do your 20,

37:34.126 --> 37:36.169
or are these guys gonna go
till they drop?

37:37.546 --> 37:39.297
It's up to you.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.800
Fine.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.093
Fascist pig.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.011
Two, three...

37:45.012 --> 37:46.429
- Everybody, stop.
- Four..

37:46.430 --> 37:48.682
- Everybody, stop.
- Six, seven...

37:48.683 --> 37:51.101
- 819, stand up.
- Eight, nine, ten.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.229
- 11, 12, 13, 14...
- I said stand up, 819!

37:54.230 --> 37:57.023
15, 16, 17, 18,

37:57.024 --> 38:00.193
19, 20, sir!

38:02.697 --> 38:05.198
What did you just call me?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.661
I think you heard me,

38:09.662 --> 38:12.539
you fascist pig.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.375
Open up the hole.
Open up the hole.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.546
The rest of you, return
to your cells immediately,

38:19.547 --> 38:21.047
have them neat and orderly,

38:21.048 --> 38:23.008
and be standing by the foot
of your bed in three minutes.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.050
Go now.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.438
Not bad,
not bad.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.361
Is this your bunk.
8612?

38:44.697 --> 38:48.033
Yes, it is,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.994
Why don't you make up
your bunk, 8612?

38:52.663 --> 38:55.165
I did,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.667
Oh, really?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.919
Well, that's not
what I see.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.214
What the fuck, man?

39:03.215 --> 39:04.424
I just made that!

39:09.889 --> 39:11.389
What was that?

39:12.433 --> 39:13.641
What just happened?

39:13.642 --> 39:15.268
Fuck.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.187
He...
You shit bag.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.646
- You...
- Take him, take him, take him.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.190
Put him in the fucking hole.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.859
- Get in the goddamn hole.
- Oh, 819's already in the hole.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.277
Put him in the hole!

39:24.278 --> 39:25.945
Should I get Zimbardo?

39:25.946 --> 39:27.572
Just put him in the hole!
Just do it.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.074
Uh...

39:29.075 --> 39:31.993
Let's just...
see what happens here.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.370
You just hit him.
You're not supposed to hit him.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.412
Clean up his bed.

39:34.413 --> 39:35.455
You're not supposed
to hit him.

39:35.456 --> 39:38.083
You hear me, 1037?
Fix his bunk.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.463
You got two minutes.
You hear me?

39:44.715 --> 39:46.841
Don't talk back.

39:48.469 --> 39:51.096
You fix that
nice and neat now.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.723
What happened out there?

39:53.724 --> 39:56.893
That guy fucking hit me
with his nightstick.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.145
He hit you?
They're not allowed to do that.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.524
Well, I did grab
his throat first, but,

40:02.525 --> 40:05.402
I got to tell you,
it felt good.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.779
It felt really good.

40:07.780 --> 40:11.157
I... I really don't think
that's the way to go.

40:11.158 --> 40:12.200
Bullshit.

40:12.201 --> 40:15.286
If we can convince the others,
the odds favor us, man.

40:15.287 --> 40:17.497
It's what they'd do
in a real prison.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.249
Wait, what are you...

40:19.250 --> 40:21.251
No talking, 8612!

40:21.252 --> 40:23.336
Shit and fall in it,
motherfucker!

40:23.337 --> 40:25.463
Think about it.
There's only ever three of them.

40:25.464 --> 40:27.257
There's nine of us.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.676
How many more of us
can they throw in here?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.662
All right, everybody.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.664
Mealtime's over.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.459
I want you to wash your dishes
and return to your cells.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.295
Come on.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.930
5486,

41:15.931 --> 41:18.016
said mealtime's over.

41:20.769 --> 41:23.438
No, not...
not until I get my glasses.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.647
Don't be a pain in the ass.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.691
I said mealtime's over.
Get up.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.028
I said I want my glasses.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.449
- Get him up.
- All right.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.617
- Get up.
- No.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.368
- No.
- Get up.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.162
- Get up.
- Fuck you.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.413
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Give me my glasses!

41:40.414 --> 41:42.040
Let go of the table.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.082
We'll talk about
your glasses.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.125
Will you just give me
my glasses?

41:44.126 --> 41:46.211
I get really bad headaches.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.712
I'm not gonna fucking...

41:47.713 --> 41:49.214
- Come here!
- Give me my fucking...

41:54.303 --> 41:57.096
- Get Zimbardo.
- I'll get Zimbardo.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.600
Lock him up.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.145
Everybody's got something,
huh?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.735
Phil, hey,
uh,

42:10.736 --> 42:12.820
you have to come
see this.

42:21.997 --> 42:23.540
When did this happen?

42:23.541 --> 42:25.959
About ten minutes ago.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.878
Should we step in?

42:28.879 --> 42:30.421
Phil?

42:33.467 --> 42:34.717
No.

42:37.179 --> 42:39.138
Let the guards figure it out.
Let's see where it goes.

42:39.139 --> 42:41.099
This is where it goes.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.267
It's only been a day.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.893
Let the guards handle it.

42:43.894 --> 42:46.354
I think this whole thing is
taking a turn for the worse.

42:46.355 --> 42:47.397
- Hey!
- You see...

42:48.732 --> 42:50.692
Let 'em handle it.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.195
Oh, man.

42:58.617 --> 42:59.784
All right, let's go.

42:59.785 --> 43:01.869
- Is it that time already?
- It's that time.

43:05.791 --> 43:08.167
Wait...
Wait, what's this all about?

43:08.168 --> 43:11.087
It's new cell assignments.
Warden's orders.

43:20.097 --> 43:22.390
How was the hole, man?

43:22.391 --> 43:24.809
It's all right.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.186
At least the guards aren't
hassling you in there.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.316
You okay, man?

43:33.527 --> 43:36.571
I'd just about suck a dick
for a cigarette.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.033
You know, I got to say,

43:40.034 --> 43:42.660
I'm very dissatisfied with
this whole experience so far.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.456
You know,
I just want my pills.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.294
They're vitamins, Gavin.

43:51.295 --> 43:52.712
You're not gonna die.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.634
Hey, guys.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.303
Guys,

44:00.304 --> 44:03.556
8612 and I were talking
in the hole and, um...

44:04.850 --> 44:07.226
I think we've got a plan.

44:15.110 --> 44:17.111
What the fuck?

44:17.112 --> 44:18.905
Oh, fuck.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.289
Someone open this door
immediately

44:28.290 --> 44:29.874
or face severe punishment.

44:29.875 --> 44:32.502
Blow it out your ass,
Mr. Correctional Officer!

44:36.298 --> 44:37.799
- Fuck!
- Whoo-hoo!

44:37.800 --> 44:39.509
Way to go,
cell number one!

44:39.510 --> 44:41.719
We're with you
all the way!

44:41.720 --> 44:43.513
Revolution!

44:44.598 --> 44:46.849
That's right!
You heard him, motherfuckers!

44:46.850 --> 44:48.768
Revolution!

44:51.063 --> 44:53.356
Men, it's your job
to keep my prison in order,

44:53.357 --> 44:54.691
and right now,
there doesn't seem to be

44:54.692 --> 44:55.942
a whole lot of order out there.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.863
Sir, they've blacked out
their doors, and they...

44:59.571 --> 45:01.364
Why am I hearing excuses?

45:02.991 --> 45:07.036
Do not forget,
you have all the authority.

45:08.288 --> 45:09.330
Yes, sir.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.290
And you're stronger
than they are.

45:11.291 --> 45:13.835
They're starting to create bonds
with each other.

45:17.089 --> 45:18.339
Break 'em up.

45:18.340 --> 45:19.716
- Okay? Get back in there.
- Yes, sir.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.384
Establish some order
before it gets out of control.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.510
Yes, sir.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.930
And don't forget,
if you need to...

45:25.931 --> 45:28.474
call for backup.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.281
Step away from the door.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.490
Fuck you.

45:44.491 --> 45:45.783
- Whoa!
- Step away from the door.

45:45.784 --> 45:46.826
Fuck you!

46:26.158 --> 46:27.200
Come on, get up!

46:28.452 --> 46:30.453
- Hey!
- Stop struggling!

46:30.454 --> 46:33.080
- They're taking our beds, man!
- Cell three, cell three.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.210
Get against the wall!

46:37.211 --> 46:39.837
I need some help over here.

46:39.838 --> 46:41.005
Hey, 8612,

46:41.006 --> 46:42.298
these guys are
model prisoners.

46:42.299 --> 46:43.758
They're literally helping us.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.009
Come on, cell three.

46:45.010 --> 46:47.303
What kind of fucking
solidarity is that?

46:47.304 --> 46:48.346
Shut the fuck up!

46:56.146 --> 46:57.939
Don't even think about it.

46:57.940 --> 46:58.981
Do not even think about it.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.525
I will ruin you.

47:01.568 --> 47:03.778
Put your caps back on.

47:03.779 --> 47:04.779
Right now!

47:08.492 --> 47:10.785
1037, where's your cap?

47:13.247 --> 47:15.873
It's right there, on the ground
in front of you.

47:18.001 --> 47:20.044
Come on, man,
put your cap back on.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.170
No way.

47:22.756 --> 47:25.007
Put your cap back on.

47:25.008 --> 47:28.052
No fucking way.

47:28.053 --> 47:29.595
All right.

47:29.596 --> 47:31.764
Help me get him on the ground.

47:31.765 --> 47:34.183
Ah!
Fuck!

47:34.184 --> 47:35.226
Give me that rope!

47:36.728 --> 47:38.396
Hey, what are you doing to him?

47:38.397 --> 47:39.647
You can't fucking do that!

47:39.648 --> 47:41.899
- That's fuck...
- Hey, shut the fuck up!

47:41.900 --> 47:45.111
- Shut up!
- Ah. Ah.

47:45.112 --> 47:46.320
- Stop!
- Get off of me!

47:46.321 --> 47:47.446
- Stop talking.
- Get off of me!

47:47.447 --> 47:48.573
Stop!

47:48.574 --> 47:50.283
Tie him up.
Tie him up good.

47:51.368 --> 47:52.660
How do you like that, huh?

47:52.661 --> 47:55.037
Stop! Stop moving!

47:57.165 --> 48:00.877
Cell two,
as you can see,

48:00.878 --> 48:02.545
your correctional staff
has prepared

48:02.546 --> 48:05.506
a delicious, nutritious,
and very special meal

48:05.507 --> 48:07.508
for the wonderful prisoners
of cell three

48:07.509 --> 48:10.636
in appreciation of their
good conduct this afternoon.

48:12.973 --> 48:15.474
You've been
model prisoners, boys.

48:15.475 --> 48:17.184
Well done.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.229
Don't eat that shit.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.523
Hands off the bars,
8612.

48:22.524 --> 48:23.566
I'm not gonna tell you again.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.443
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

49:11.031 --> 49:12.990
Dan.

49:24.670 --> 49:25.962
Okay, one thing, though...

49:25.963 --> 49:27.964
if only one of us gets away,
we've got to send help

49:27.965 --> 49:29.799
to bust the other guys out.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.133
Deal?

49:31.134 --> 49:32.843
Yeah.
Yeah, deal.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.261
Yeah.

49:41.144 --> 49:42.979
Coast is clear.

49:50.904 --> 49:52.571
Um...

49:52.572 --> 49:56.117
I think that 8612's definitely
been a little, um...

49:56.118 --> 49:57.410
testy.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.829
Well, that's the word
you're gonna use?

49:59.830 --> 50:01.831
Well, let's go back and look
at his questionnaire.

50:01.832 --> 50:04.166
- I...
- Who's got him?

50:04.167 --> 50:06.085
- I don't... I don't...
- I think...

50:15.137 --> 50:18.264
Hey! Hey!
Hey!

50:19.683 --> 50:20.891
No, no, no, no.
We can't wait for this, man.

50:20.892 --> 50:22.768
Here.
Quick.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.275
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

50:29.276 --> 50:30.317
All the doors are locked!

50:30.318 --> 50:31.360
We got to go, man.
They're coming.

50:31.361 --> 50:32.445
How the fuck do we
get out of here, man?

50:32.446 --> 50:33.487
I don't even know
where we are.

50:33.488 --> 50:34.530
Hey!

50:34.531 --> 50:35.906
What are you doing?

50:35.907 --> 50:37.241
I'm gonna need you to...

50:37.242 --> 50:38.826
Order you to get back
in your cells.

50:40.454 --> 50:42.955
Fuck you, pig!

50:42.956 --> 50:44.749
The prisoners are escaping!

50:46.918 --> 50:49.462
Uh, okay.

50:49.463 --> 50:50.963
The exit! Let's go!

50:53.925 --> 50:56.427
Oh, what the...

50:56.428 --> 50:59.180
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Yeah, go back! Go back!

50:59.181 --> 51:00.973
Oh, no. No.

51:00.974 --> 51:02.391
- Against the wall.

51:02.392 --> 51:04.143
- Against the wall.
- Shut up!

51:07.731 --> 51:08.939
- Fucker, get in there.
- Calm down, man.

51:08.940 --> 51:10.357
- Fuck you!
- Jesus Christ.

51:10.358 --> 51:13.402
Shut your fucking mouth!

51:13.403 --> 51:15.446
You shut
your fucking mouth!

51:15.447 --> 51:17.198
Shut your fucking mouth.

51:17.199 --> 51:19.992
- I'm tired of this shit!
- You can't do this to us!

51:19.993 --> 51:21.327
You're messing with...

51:21.328 --> 51:23.496
You can't fucking
do this to us!

51:23.497 --> 51:26.040
Stop!
Stop! Stop!

51:26.041 --> 51:27.666
- You can't do this to us!
- All right!

51:27.667 --> 51:29.376
- Okay, okay! Stop!
- All right!

51:29.377 --> 51:30.419
Stop!

51:40.931 --> 51:43.516
8612, you have proven to be
a singular

51:43.517 --> 51:46.519
and terrible influence to all
of your prisoners around you.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.647
You will stay in the hole
until further notice.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.858
You will remain here,

51:52.859 --> 51:54.944
and you will remain silent

51:54.945 --> 51:56.070
until we fix the door
to your cell.

51:56.071 --> 51:57.780
Is that understood?

51:57.781 --> 51:59.031
Yes, Mr. Correctional...

51:59.032 --> 52:00.866
- Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.
- Good.

52:33.441 --> 52:36.193
Guys, wake up.
Guys, get up.

52:37.571 --> 52:39.530
Guys, wake up! Guys, get up!

52:43.201 --> 52:45.494
Well, well, well,

52:45.495 --> 52:48.747
look at you three, all
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

52:48.748 --> 52:52.251
You know, you boys are in
for a whole heap of trouble,

52:52.252 --> 52:54.670
but if you clear this here,
uh, barricade,

52:54.671 --> 52:57.965
I can spare you a shit storm the
likes of which you never seen.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.676
Don't let them in.
Come on.

53:02.512 --> 53:04.096
Well,

53:04.097 --> 53:06.640
that's how he wants it.

53:14.107 --> 53:15.858
Knock it down, boys.

53:21.281 --> 53:23.032
All right, now,

53:23.033 --> 53:24.909
up against the wall.

53:26.494 --> 53:28.370
I leave all of y'all alone

53:28.371 --> 53:31.415
for less than a day,
and look what happens.

53:31.416 --> 53:33.500
You lose your beds,

53:33.501 --> 53:35.252
try to escape.

53:36.796 --> 53:40.925
What is so goddamn wrong
with all of y'all, huh?

53:42.719 --> 53:46.305
This behavior
will not be tolerated.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.140
And you,

53:48.141 --> 53:49.475
look at yourself.

53:49.476 --> 53:52.019
You're naked.

53:52.020 --> 53:55.314
Why in God's name
are you naked, boy?

53:55.315 --> 53:57.566
Um,
because...

53:57.567 --> 53:59.068
You know what?
Never mind.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.444
I don't even care.

54:00.445 --> 54:02.029
Get him back his uniform,
will you, boss?

54:02.030 --> 54:03.239
He'll catch a cold.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.823
Guys, guys,

54:04.824 --> 54:08.202
I really need... I need
to speak to a doctor or...

54:09.454 --> 54:10.496
Or the warden
or somebody.

54:10.497 --> 54:12.706
Quiet, 8612.

54:12.707 --> 54:13.749
Come on, man!
Don't do that!

54:13.750 --> 54:15.334
It hurts my ears!

54:15.335 --> 54:16.627
Maybe you'll think
about that

54:16.628 --> 54:18.087
next time you get yourself
put in the hole.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.672
All right, you can
fuck off, man!

54:25.262 --> 54:28.222
Now, because

54:28.223 --> 54:29.848
I am not nearly as cruel

54:29.849 --> 54:32.476
as my fellow colleagues
on the day shift,

54:32.477 --> 54:35.354
your blankets will be returned
to y'all

54:35.355 --> 54:38.107
and your dresses
will be repaired.

54:38.108 --> 54:41.944
However, should you feel
the need to defecate or urinate,

54:41.945 --> 54:45.364
please feel free to do so
in the fine buckets

54:45.365 --> 54:48.200
provided by
your correctional staff.

54:48.201 --> 54:50.160
That'd be us.

54:51.579 --> 54:53.163
Thank you.

54:53.164 --> 54:54.540
Guys, seriously,

54:54.541 --> 54:56.166
y-y-you don't know.

54:56.167 --> 54:57.584
I got to go...

54:57.585 --> 54:59.503
I... to a doctor.

54:59.504 --> 55:00.713
Anything!

55:00.714 --> 55:02.798
I don't know.
I'm fucked up!

55:02.799 --> 55:05.384
I feel so fucked up
inside!

55:05.385 --> 55:08.178
I mean, God!
I mean, Jesus Christ!

55:08.179 --> 55:10.222
I'm burning up inside!

55:10.223 --> 55:11.807
Don't you know?

55:11.808 --> 55:14.018
Please, please!

55:14.019 --> 55:15.894
Please, please,

55:15.895 --> 55:18.397
please, please!

55:18.398 --> 55:20.149
Let me out of here!

55:20.150 --> 55:22.651
I want out!

55:22.652 --> 55:24.820
I want out now!

55:25.989 --> 55:28.282
He could be faking it.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.328
Should we deny his request?

55:35.790 --> 55:39.043
Let's bring him to
the old classroom upstairs.

56:09.783 --> 56:11.700
So, prisoner 8612,

56:11.701 --> 56:14.703
I understand
you're not feeling well.

56:14.704 --> 56:17.539
Um, yeah.
Yeah, I just, uh...

56:18.500 --> 56:20.084
I've had this really bad
headache all day,

56:20.085 --> 56:22.795
and, um, a couple hours ago,

56:22.796 --> 56:25.172
I started feeling
my stomach being all...

56:25.173 --> 56:26.840
being all knotted up.

56:26.841 --> 56:30.219
And what is it you'd like
for us to do about that?

56:31.763 --> 56:33.639
Well, I just...

56:33.640 --> 56:36.225
I figured I ought to,
you know,

56:36.226 --> 56:39.353
g-get out and go...
go see a doctor...

56:39.354 --> 56:41.730
Just to be sure.

56:41.731 --> 56:44.525
Surely you're not suggesting

56:44.526 --> 56:46.193
that we release you
from prison

56:46.194 --> 56:47.861
for a stomachache.

56:50.115 --> 56:51.490
Look, man,

56:51.491 --> 56:53.200
I just really don't feel well,

56:53.201 --> 56:54.701
and it would be really nice...

56:54.702 --> 56:56.036
Bullshit!

56:57.747 --> 57:00.874
100% Grade A bullshit.

57:00.875 --> 57:03.252
This boy's not sick.
This boy is weak.

57:03.253 --> 57:04.711
All right, listen, doc.

57:04.712 --> 57:06.130
You don't know what
it's like down there.

57:06.131 --> 57:07.589
What did you say?

57:07.590 --> 57:10.217
What did you just say to me?

57:12.762 --> 57:13.929
Hmm?

57:13.930 --> 57:15.931
I said, "You don't know
what it's like down there."

57:15.932 --> 57:19.393
San Quentin, boy,
17 years of hard time.

57:19.394 --> 57:21.895
Do you really think
you can tell me

57:21.896 --> 57:23.439
what it's like
on the inside?

57:24.816 --> 57:26.400
Uh, no.
No.

57:26.401 --> 57:27.860
I, uh...
No, I guess not.

57:27.861 --> 57:29.278
You damn right
you guess not.

57:29.279 --> 57:33.365
Look me in my eye
when I'm talking to you.

57:36.286 --> 57:39.204
You're a wimp,
8612.

57:39.205 --> 57:40.706
They'd knock
your goddamn teeth out

57:40.707 --> 57:42.207
and pass you around
like candy.

57:53.553 --> 57:56.555
So why don't you tell us
what the real problem is?

57:58.475 --> 58:00.434
Uh, all right.

58:00.435 --> 58:02.436
It's the guards, man.

58:02.437 --> 58:03.562
I mean, I really think
the guards

58:03.563 --> 58:05.689
have gone
a little bit overboard.

58:05.690 --> 58:09.318
From what I've seen, I'd say
you brought that on yourself.

58:10.069 --> 58:12.863
Look, I'd just really like
to get out of here, okay?

58:12.864 --> 58:16.033
You know that you're the most
rebellious one in here.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.995
It's pretty impressive.

58:19.996 --> 58:22.789
Maybe if you spent
a little less time fighting,

58:22.790 --> 58:24.374
you wouldn't be so tired.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.418
Yeah, but what
am I supposed to do, just...

58:26.419 --> 58:28.086
Don't interrupt me.

58:28.087 --> 58:30.380
I'm sorry, sir.

58:30.381 --> 58:31.757
Come on.
Look at you.

58:31.758 --> 58:34.635
You telling me
you can't handle, what,

58:34.636 --> 58:36.053
some push-ups,

58:36.054 --> 58:37.971
some jumping jacks,

58:37.972 --> 58:40.265
guys calling you names?

58:40.266 --> 58:42.643
Come on.

58:42.644 --> 58:44.645
Tell you what,
I'll talk to the guards

58:44.646 --> 58:46.438
and tell them to go easy on you,
all right?

58:46.439 --> 58:49.525
W-would you do that?

58:50.693 --> 58:52.986
Phil, I think
we're done here.

58:52.987 --> 58:55.155
Take him away.

58:56.866 --> 58:58.116
Wait!
Wait!

58:58.117 --> 58:59.618
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

58:59.619 --> 59:00.869
I'm not done here!

59:00.870 --> 59:02.329
No, no, no.

59:02.330 --> 59:03.705
I want to finish
the conversation.

59:03.706 --> 59:05.290
I don't want to do this.

59:06.334 --> 59:07.834
Hey, you're not really
gonna tell them

59:07.835 --> 59:08.835
to take it easy on him,
are you?

59:08.836 --> 59:10.087
Oh, my God.
Of course not.

59:10.088 --> 59:11.547
Are you kidding me?
He was faking it, anyway.

59:11.548 --> 59:12.631
I can tell.

59:12.632 --> 59:15.133
There's no way he's getting out
of here right now.

59:15.134 --> 59:18.428
During meals and whenever
they are in the prison yard.

59:18.429 --> 59:21.098
Oh, hello, 8612.

59:21.099 --> 59:23.350
Welcome back.

59:23.351 --> 59:26.144
Get your ass
back in line, boy.

59:26.145 --> 59:28.438
As I was saying,

59:28.439 --> 59:31.608
prisoners must remain silent
during rest periods,

59:31.609 --> 59:35.946
after lights out, during meals,
and outside the prison yard.

59:35.947 --> 59:37.656
- Rule number two...
- What happened?

59:37.657 --> 59:39.366
Prisoners must eat
at meal times...

59:39.367 --> 59:42.077
I couldn't get out.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.745
What do you mean, you couldn't
get out of the contract?

59:43.746 --> 59:44.871
Hey!

59:44.872 --> 59:46.873
No talking on the line,
you two.

59:46.874 --> 59:49.042
- Contract don't mean shit.
- Rule number three.

59:49.043 --> 59:52.629
I mean I couldn't get out.
I mean they wouldn't let me out.

59:52.630 --> 59:54.047
This is all real.

59:54.048 --> 59:55.382
This is all real.

59:55.383 --> 59:56.633
This is all real.
This is all real.

59:56.634 --> 59:57.968
This isn't a fucking experiment.

59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.012
This is all real.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.680
They won't let you go.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.223
They won't let us leave.

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:04.933
You understand?
This is real.

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.602
This isn't
a fucking experiment.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.478
Don't fucking touch me, man!

01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:09.813
- Just get back in line here.
- I mean it!

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:11.398
- Come here.
- No! No!

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.275
Let go of me!
No!

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.402
You motherfuckers!

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:18.947
You motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:21.408
You fascist motherfuckers!

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:23.327
I want to see the warden!

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:25.579
You understand me?

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.998
You have no right
to fuck with my head!

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.875
You have no right!

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.543
I'll smash this camera!

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:33.462
I'll beat up
your fucking guards!

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:36.298
I want out,
and I want out right now!

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.759
You're messing with my head,
man.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.385
My head!

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:44.890
You have no right
to fuck with my head!

01:00:48.519 --> 01:00:49.811
Okay, what is it?

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.688
Uh...

01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:54.608
We‒we hit a breaking point
last night,

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:59.237
and, um,
8612 is gone.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:01.031
We let him go.

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:07.371
Well...
You let him go?

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.081
Well, the contract
explicitly says that...

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.916
Do you understand
how much time and energy,

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.502
not to...
not to mention money,

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.962
has been spent
on this experiment?

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:19.841
I leave for one shift,

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.593
and you have tampered
with the integrity

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:22.928
of the entire enterprise.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.846
Phil, we were following
protocol.

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.640
The kid was
in a serious crisis.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:27.683
He was hysterical.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.059
He was threatening
to harm himself and...

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.769
I'm the superintendent
of this facility.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.604
I make that decision.
Nobody else.

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:33.980
It was late.

01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:35.607
Everything was escalating
really quickly.

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:36.650
- Kyle.
- We...

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.443
Did you even stop to think,

01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:42.155
for one second, if 8612,
just like Jesse said yesterday,

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:43.281
was bullshitting you?

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:45.242
He wanted a lawyer.

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:52.999
What is it
with these lawyers?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.877
Oh, my God.
I see.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.796
I see.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:01.758
Well, then,
why did 8612 lose it?

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:04.094
What did we miss
in the screening process?

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.137
I mean, we missed something.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:08.223
We were all there.
We all screened him.

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:09.933
He was only in there
for two days.

01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:14.187
Yeah, but without any
sunlight and sleep,

01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:16.314
your sense of time
has been totally altered.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:19.359
His only weakness
was that he resisted.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.111
He didn't bend,
so he broke.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:24.364
No, he broke because he couldn't
control the other prisoners.

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:27.659
8612 just wanted control.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.828
Even as a prisoner
with essentially no rights?

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.371
No, Jesse's right about that.

01:02:31.372 --> 01:02:33.373
8612 was fine

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:35.125
while other people
were serving him.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.293
So what?

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:38.336
You think if the other
prisoners had stuck with him,

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:40.172
then, what, John Wayne
would have lost?

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:43.300
Man, John Wayne can't lose.
He served the system.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:45.302
8612 served himself.

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:47.888
I'm sorry.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:48.930
I don't buy any of this.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.933
No, I don't imagine
you would.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.312
This is bullshit.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.898
You're basing your conclusions
off your own experience...

01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:00.066
on real felons
in a real prison.

01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:01.234
So this is not a prison?

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:03.236
This is a simulated prison.

01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:05.405
This is 18 college boys

01:03:05.406 --> 01:03:07.073
who's never been punched
in the fucking face.

01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.909
That's what this is.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.577
I think you guys
are both missing the point.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.454
- He missing the point.
- I'm not missing anything.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.497
You missing something.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:15.749
No, here's the point.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:19.920
The only thing
that separates those two

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:22.047
was a coin flip.

01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:28.553
All right, what steps are being
taken to replace 8612?

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:30.013
Well, none, as of yet.

01:03:30.014 --> 01:03:31.473
- We got...
- Kyle, come on.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.183
Start notifying the alternates
immediately, okay?

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:34.267
Okay.

01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:35.685
And find out which ones
can start tomorrow.

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:36.770
Got it.

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:38.891
Until then, what do you want me
to tell the prisoners?

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:43.777
Tell them 8612 has been taken
to maximum security.

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:47.030
Get some more fear
into them.

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.706
As you know,

01:03:56.707 --> 01:03:59.209
today is visiting day.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.671
For the sake of your friends
and family,

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:05.465
I want this place
made presentable.

01:04:05.466 --> 01:04:07.509
That means cleaning up
the mess you've made,

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.512
as well as cleaning up
yourselves.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.098
Out of respect
for your loved ones,

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.350
I want you to put on
the outward appearance

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:18.061
of self-dignity,
confidence,

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:21.106
love,
happiness,

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.108
even if you have none.

01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:43.086
You never had it this good,
have you, 2093?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.464
No, I haven't
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:50.135
So you never want to go home,
huh?

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:54.180
I don't have a home,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.851
What was that?

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.812
I don't have a home.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:02.856
Can't afford one after tuition.

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:04.941
Been living in my car
all this summer.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.705
Y'all, uh,

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:22.292
y'all see how good you got it
now, don't you, huh?

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:24.544
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:26.004
Well, you best remember that

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.839
when you're talking
to your visitors.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.064
Wait.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:47.150
Hey, um,
you guys should hear this.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.111
So this was taken
a couple of hours ago

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.072
from the mic in cell two.

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:53.740
I was talking to the big guard,

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.451
and he told me
that they had him locked up

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.954
in maximum security.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.580
No, that's bullshit, man.

01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:03.333
I'm telling you, he's at home.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.669
That breakdown
was some jive acting.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.921
- He'll be back.
- What makes you say that?

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:09.339
Because we had a deal.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.256
When we tried to escape,

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:13.593
he said if either of us
make it out,

01:06:13.594 --> 01:06:15.011
that‒that we'd come back

01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:17.430
and then bust
the rest of the guys out.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.851
Hey, Phil.

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:22.894
Phil, it's time.

01:06:22.895 --> 01:06:24.688
The, uh... the visitors
are here.

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:08.440
So...

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.150
How are you holding up?

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.193
I'm... I'm okay.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.820
You know, it's actually
not so bad

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:15.822
if you just cooperate.

01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:17.991
But are you...

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:20.368
cooperating?

01:07:24.081 --> 01:07:26.166
You're cooperating, right?

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:30.503
Ever since I was stripped down,
bare naked, I have been.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.678
Yeah, 'cause, see, I got
most of the rules memorized,

01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:41.056
except for the...
I guess, the new ones we get

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.140
at the guards' discretion.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:44.684
Tell him
the most important rule, 4325.

01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:46.936
The most important rule is
always obey the guards,

01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:48.146
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:49.189
Amen to that.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:52.609
Can they tell you
to do anything?

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.569
Yeah.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.821
What right do they have
to do that?

01:07:56.822 --> 01:07:59.199
Well, the guards
run the prison.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.408
Well, aren't there
certain rights

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:01.618
that they have
to respect, I mean...

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.745
Well, prisoners have no rights.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.623
Well, I think
maybe they do.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:08.666
Not in this prison.

01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:14.589
H-how's the food?
Are they feeding you well?

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:17.550
Yeah, three meals a day.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:18.926
You look exhausted.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.428
He looks fine.

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:24.015
Probably just a little
too much time in the hole.

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:25.934
W-what's the hole?

01:08:26.977 --> 01:08:29.979
I don't think you're supposed
to talk about the hole.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.523
Okay.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.899
If something isn't right,
you can let us know.

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:36.319
You know that.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.029
No.
I-I...

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.531
Everything's fine.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:40.532
Are you sure?

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.950
Yeah, of course.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.743
Okay.

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:45.078
We miss you.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.578
I miss you too.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.682
Drive safe. Thank you.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.727
Uh, Mr. Zimbardo,

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:11.479
we don't mean
to make any trouble,

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.232
but we're just a bit
concerned about our son.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:15.274
Okay.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.193
Well, what...
what...

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:18.944
what seems to be
the problem?

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:21.238
Honestly, he looks like
he hasn't slept in a week.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.323
Hmm.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:23.575
Is there anything wrong
with your boy?

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.702
Does he...
does he sleep well?

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:26.743
Normally, yes.

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:28.412
I-I... that's what has me
so concerned.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.582
You know what? We are recreating
a prison environment here,

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:31.749
and one of the ways
that we do that

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.960
is by instituting
regular counts.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.712
Some of those counts take place
very late at night.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:38.673
So that may be it.

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:39.883
Okay.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:40.925
To be honest,
Mrs. Mitchell,

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.468
we're all very tired,

01:09:42.469 --> 01:09:45.013
but everybody else seems to be
handling it pretty well,

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.805
and...

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.100
I don't know.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.895
Your son seems to be
a pretty tough kid.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.104
Do you think
he can handle it?

01:09:53.104 --> 01:09:54.647
Of course, he can.

01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:55.857
He is a tough kid.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.777
My wife's just being
overprotective.

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:01.613
- It's her nature.
- No, I understand.

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.823
We've wasted enough
of the man's time.

01:10:03.824 --> 01:10:06.284
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Zimbardo.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:09.245
You're welcome.
It's Doctor.

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:11.623
Doctor.

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.380
- Hey.
- Okay.

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:21.925
I think we're gonna double up
on security tonight.

01:10:22.509 --> 01:10:23.968
Right?

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:25.428
Uh...

01:10:25.429 --> 01:10:27.513
Guys, 8612.

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:30.141
You heard the tape.

01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:33.061
He wants to come back, break
the other prisoners out, okay?

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.688
Right, he wants to play a little
cat and mouse game, that's fine.

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:37.232
I'll play a little
cat and mouse game with him,

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.108
but I'm not gonna let him
screw up our work.

01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:41.945
I'm gonna personally
sit guard myself tonight.

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.905
Phil, you know, we actually
were just talking...

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.199
that it might be a good idea for
you to get some rest tonight.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.284
No, a good idea right now
is to keep our prison safe.

01:10:48.285 --> 01:10:50.328
I expect you guys to be a little
bit sharper than this, okay?

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.996
Are we on the same page?
Can we be on the same page?

01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:53.039
- Sure.
- Yeah.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.666
Right? All right.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.146
Phil?

01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:19.983
Yes. Hi, Jim.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:22.151
What are you...
What are you doing down here?

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:24.487
Picking up
some summer reading.

01:11:24.488 --> 01:11:27.657
And you?
It's quite the late hour.

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:31.828
I'm actually waiting for
one of my subjects to arrive.

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:34.372
- Ah, your prison study.
- Mm.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.876
I saw some of your boys earlier
in the hallway.

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:41.462
It's a frightful sight.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:43.881
Just following protocol.

01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:46.676
Mm.

01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:47.844
Well, I would love to...

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:49.137
to sit and chat
with you, Jim,

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.806
but I'm actually in the middle
of it right now.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.933
Oh.
Certainly.

01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:56.102
- We'll catch up later.
- Yes.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:12:01.024
Something I'm curious about,
Philip.

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:04.736
What's the independent variable
in your study?

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.532
I'm sorry?

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.076
Have you introduced
a variable

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:14.954
that might influence
your outcome?

01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:16.289
This is an experiment, right?

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.458
Not just a simulation.

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:22.295
Are you challenging me,
Jim?

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:24.922
No, I'm not challenging.
I just...

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:26.382
Well, while I would love
to sit here and

01:12:26.383 --> 01:12:27.675
explain my prison to you,

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.093
I actually have
more pressing matters

01:12:29.094 --> 01:12:30.803
than whether or not you
understand the academics

01:12:30.804 --> 01:12:32.513
of my work.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.725
Sorry to bother you.

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:41.022
I'll see you again
when the semester begins.

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:52.909
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.661
Looks like 8612
is a no-show for tonight.

01:12:55.662 --> 01:12:57.705
Let's get Kyle and Vogel
and meet in the conference room.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.582
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.709
but Kyle's gone.

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:03.795
Gone?

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.254
What the fuck do you mean,
gone?

01:13:05.255 --> 01:13:06.923
I mean, gone, gone.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:09.175
He, uh... he had a death
in the family.

01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:11.135
Jesus Christ.

01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:12.845
I mean, I'm sorry,
but, fuck,

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:14.639
this could not have come
at a worse time.

01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:34.409
He didn't come.

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.372
It's been days since he got out,
and he didn't come.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.207
Hasn't even been a day yet.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.708
That's not true.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.002
It's been at least two.

01:13:45.003 --> 01:13:46.045
No.

01:13:46.046 --> 01:13:47.839
No way.

01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:49.924
Oh, fuck.

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.467
How are we even
supposed to know?

01:13:51.468 --> 01:13:54.637
He told us
he would come get us.

01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:56.556
Yeah, well,

01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:58.933
he also started to think
that all this was real.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.102
Isn't it?

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.230
Hey, man. Hey.

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:06.357
You got to pull it together,
all right?

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.942
We've only got another week
in here.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.360
Another week?

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.822
We're not even gonna last
another night.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:17.118
They've taken our clothes;
they've taken our beds.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.455
They don't even do that
in real prisons.

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:22.707
They do.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:27.044
All right. Come on.

01:14:27.045 --> 01:14:29.088
Mealtime.
Let's go.

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:32.300
Come on. Let's go.

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:36.846
Come on.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.435
Come on, 819.

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:44.604
It's mealtime.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.901
Do we have a problem here?

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.740
I want to see a doctor.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.325
See if you can find one
in there.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.769
Ah!

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:30.107
What's going on in there?

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:32.944
Ah!

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.035
What's your name, son?

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:43.246
I'm 4325, sir.

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:46.332
So how are you holding up?

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.168
Not too bad, considering,
sir.

01:15:52.589 --> 01:15:55.424
Um, sorry, Father.
What are you doing here?

01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:58.219
I'm here to provide
guidance and counsel

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.888
to the prisoners
in this jail.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.224
So what measures
are you taking

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.725
to get out of prison?

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:08.437
I'm not...

01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:11.107
entirely sure
if I understand the question.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:12.692
Has bail been set
in your case yet?

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.527
If it has, sir,
I'm unaware of it.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.571
All right,
what about counsel?

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.947
Do you have a lawyer?

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.741
No.

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:25.496
I wasn't aware that I was,
um,

01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:27.206
supposed to...

01:16:28.166 --> 01:16:29.667
Do I need a lawyer?

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.419
Well, son, just how
do you suppose

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.129
you're ever going to get out
of here without one?

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.171
Wha...

01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:36.424
Why‒why would I need a lawyer
for an experiment?

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.635
Well, I don't know what
experiment you're referring to,

01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:42.888
but you've got to take control
of your situation here, son.

01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:45.099
Take control of your life.

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.394
Uh...

01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:51.188
Come on, 819,
you're the last one up, buddy.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:16:59.864
Yeah, sit down.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.787
All right, let's start
with your name, son.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:07.788
What's your name?

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.462
8‒819?

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.380
It's not a trick question,
son.

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:22.845
It's 819.

01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:24.388
And what steps
are you taking

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.349
to secure your release?

01:17:28.518 --> 01:17:29.852
I'm sorry.

01:17:29.853 --> 01:17:32.188
What‒what steps am I...
am I what?

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.814
It's a simple question, son.

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:35.358
I don't know why
you're asking me this.

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.026
I don't know what
any of this means.

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:39.612
I didn't know I had to take
steps to secure my release.

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:40.905
I don't know what
you're talking about!

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:41.947
Calm down, son.

01:17:41.948 --> 01:17:43.491
Have you spoken
to your lawyer?

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.784
My lawyer?

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.410
I have an uncle
who's a lawyer.

01:17:46.411 --> 01:17:47.787
I could call him,
but I don't...

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.080
That sounds like
a good start.

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:50.706
All right, all right,
just calm down.

01:17:50.707 --> 01:17:51.957
Every‒everything's
gonna be fine.

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:53.958
- Take a deep breath.
- No, look, I'm sorry, but...

01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:57.380
Can I just see a doctor
or call my parents?

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:59.507
I just need a little help
right now, and I...

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:00.925
Please, can I just see
a doctor or something?

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.301
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

01:18:02.302 --> 01:18:04.720
Hey, everything's
gonna be all right.

01:18:04.721 --> 01:18:05.805
Listen,
what I'm gonna do is,

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.098
we're gonna clear out
of this room,

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.016
get a nice meal
brought in here.

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.267
If you're still feeling
bad this afternoon,

01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:11.560
we'll call a doctor, okay?

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:17.650
Okay, so I'm assuming

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:20.111
that you've all seen
and heard the mess

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:23.781
that your fellow prisoner has
created for us this afternoon.

01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:27.034
So I want you all
to say now,

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.661
after me,

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:32.248
"Prisoner 819
did a bad thing."

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:36.293
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:18:36.294 --> 01:18:38.379
Okay, that's great,
but I said loudly enough

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.297
so that he can hear you.

01:18:40.298 --> 01:18:41.549
20 times.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.259
Let's go.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.303
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:18:46.304 --> 01:18:48.931
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:52.143
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:53.894
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.521
Well, uh, thanks again,
Father.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:57.106
I think it really did
make a difference.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:59.108
- It's my pleasure.
- Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:00.776
What you're doing here,
it's a good thing.

01:19:00.777 --> 01:19:02.194
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:02.195 --> 01:19:04.864
It'll teach these boys of
privilege what a prison is.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:07.158
They should know.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:09.702
I couldn't agree
with you more.

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.413
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:16.250
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:19.295
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:22.131
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:25.092
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.803
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:27.804 --> 01:19:30.765
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.684
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:36.103
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:40.107
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:41.525
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:42.860
Hey, Phil.

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:44.195
I'm really worried
about 819.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:46.197
- He's calling a lawyer.
- Who?

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:47.531
The priest.

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.116
I don't trust that man.

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:50.868
They can shut
this whole place down.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.411
I don't think so.

01:19:52.412 --> 01:19:53.704
He wasn't here ten minutes,

01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:55.414
and he became
part of the experiment.

01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:56.624
Even if he did call a lawyer,

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.083
why should that
be any different?

01:19:58.084 --> 01:19:59.335
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:01.086
No!

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:04.465
- Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.
- No, I didn't!

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.926
- Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.
- No!

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:12.014
Just stay here.
Let me handle this.

01:20:21.107 --> 01:20:22.149
Hey, Peter?

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.484
They think I'm
a bad prisoner,

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.486
but I'm not,
I swear I'm not.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:26.862
Hey. Hey.

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:28.948
You're not even
a prisoner at all.

01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:32.576
And that's not a prison.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.579
It's a hallway...

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.042
With a bunch
of empty offices

01:20:40.043 --> 01:20:42.253
in the basement
of Jordan Hall.

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:53.347
You're free to go.

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:54.890
Okay?

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:59.228
All you have to do is sign
a couple of release papers.

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:01.021
All right?

01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:05.317
Jesus, Phil,
why did you do that?

01:21:05.318 --> 01:21:06.819
Hey, he was a lost cause.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:07.945
I had to say something.

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:09.196
All this talk
about lawyers...

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.739
I can't afford
any more liabilities.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:11.949
I'm not letting anything
get in the way

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.075
of the progress
that we made...

01:21:13.076 --> 01:21:14.493
I know.
I understand that.

01:21:14.494 --> 01:21:16.203
And will you make sure that
he takes him to Student Health

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:17.454
and gets him checked out?

01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:18.747
Yeah.

01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:20.541
Hey, did you find
a replacement for 8612?

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.042
I'm trying.
It's not that easy.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.210
There's not that many people
left on campus.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.920
Well, get on it!

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:52.656
Phil?

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:56.660
- Oh, ah.
- Hi.

01:21:57.829 --> 01:21:59.121
Hi. Oh.

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:00.456
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:03.709
So this is it?

01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:05.210
Well, it's quiet right now,

01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:08.547
but it... it has been
truly extraordinary

01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:11.258
the way these boys
have adapted.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:14.595
It's significant.

01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:17.222
It'll get better
later tonight.

01:22:17.223 --> 01:22:19.850
Well, you're gonna have me
around for a while.

01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:21.226
I heard about Kyle.

01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:25.564
So I'm volunteering to take
his place on the parole board.

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:26.857
That's fantastic.

01:22:26.858 --> 01:22:30.235
Now you'll get to see
what it's really like.

01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:32.571
Like a chimp.

01:22:32.572 --> 01:22:35.157
And then the chimp
raped the woman.

01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:37.368
- And she had a baby that...
- You're a liar, man.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.535
No, no, I swear. I swear.

01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:40.829
Literally, every story you tell
is a bullshit lie.

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:42.247
I'm fucking serious.

01:22:42.248 --> 01:22:44.541
And the baby was half chimp
and half human.

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:46.710
It had, like, sideburns
and shit, like those.

01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:48.337
- I'm fucking serious.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:50.965
Hey, let's go, new guy, eat up.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.883
No thank you,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.889
Well, that is not
an option, 416.

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:01.809
Well, I'm sorry
you think that, sir.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.978
You're sorry...

01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:09.149
Bring me his plate.

01:23:13.196 --> 01:23:16.323
How about you pick up
those sausages, boy?

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.413
Now,

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:24.832
you will not leave
this closet

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:28.711
until those sausages
are in your belly.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:29.753
Got me?

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.848
I believe the correctional staff

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:44.685
has convinced me
of my many weaknesses.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.854
Despite my horrible disrespect
for them,

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:49.064
the staff has treated me well.

01:23:50.984 --> 01:23:54.111
I now know that every member
of the correctional staff

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:57.948
is only interested in
the well-being of the prisoners.

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.535
And I believe that
because of their goodness,

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.455
I have been rehabilitated
and transformed

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.457
into a better human being.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:10.169
On a personal note,
the prisoner adds,

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:12.588
I will turn 23 on Monday.

01:24:13.506 --> 01:24:15.507
This being my last year
at Stanford,

01:24:15.508 --> 01:24:17.092
I would like to be paroled

01:24:17.093 --> 01:24:19.678
so that I may spend one more
birthday with my old friends.

01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:22.181
Sincerely, 1037.

01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:26.518
From your request,
it sounds like

01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:29.063
you're very happy
with your setup here.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.814
Why do you want parole?

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:35.903
Well, as I stated
in the request,

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.321
it's my 23rd birthday on...

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:39.615
Don't you think
the prison staff is capable

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:41.658
of giving you
a birthday party?

01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:43.786
Yes.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:47.372
But for sentimental reasons,
I would rather spend...

01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:50.125
You should have thought about
that before you broke the law.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:52.127
Sir?

01:24:52.128 --> 01:24:55.422
Why are you in prison,
1037?

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:58.675
I was charged with assault
with a deadly weapon.

01:24:58.676 --> 01:25:00.219
How do you plead?

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.220
Not guilty.

01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:04.348
Not guilty?
Not guilty?

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:06.225
So you're saying that the police
officers who arrested you

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:07.309
didn't know what
they were doing,

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:09.937
that they...
that there was a mistake,

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:12.022
that there was some confusion,
that there...

01:25:12.023 --> 01:25:14.024
- No, sir.
- I'm not done speaking.

01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:15.651
They're lying,
is that what your saying?

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:16.693
They're lying?

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.864
Well, I haven't seen
any evidence,

01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:24.535
but I'm sure it's probably good
if they picked me up for it.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:28.247
Then you admit
there is some merit

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:30.415
to the charges against you.

01:25:30.416 --> 01:25:32.000
Yes.

01:25:32.418 --> 01:25:35.879
There probably is some merit

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.756
in what they're saying.

01:25:37.757 --> 01:25:38.924
Yes.

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:40.134
You do recognize

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.678
that prisons are
for people who break rules,

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:45.764
and you put your freedom
in jeopardy

01:25:45.765 --> 01:25:48.475
doing exactly
which you did.

01:25:51.354 --> 01:25:53.856
Yes, and I realize that now,
and I...

01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:56.024
I find it hard to take
the word of a young man

01:25:56.025 --> 01:26:00.154
with such a checkered
history with the law.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.322
What kind of citizen

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.908
do you think you can be
with these kinds of charges?

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:08.871
I don't understand
the question, sir.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:10.664
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you don't understand.

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:13.375
1965, you were picked up
and later released

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:15.961
on suspicion of car theft.

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:19.089
1969, you were picked up
and later released

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:23.677
for lack of evidence at a place
where narcotics were found.

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:25.429
1970,

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.265
you were arrested
for passing bad checks.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.767
Now, you tell us that
you can make it out there,

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:33.103
but your behavior
don't reflect it,

01:26:33.104 --> 01:26:36.023
nor do your behavior
reflect it here.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:39.526
Now, I think

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:43.071
that you're destined
to be prison scum.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:49.453
I understand that, sir.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:52.331
You believe in God?

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:55.542
Yes, sir, I do.

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.503
Why is that?

01:26:58.504 --> 01:27:00.797
Well, because that's just
what I was taught, and...

01:27:00.798 --> 01:27:05.385
You were also taught that
assault is against the law.

01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:09.681
Or do you think it's legitimate
to go around hurting people?

01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:11.725
No, sir. I do not.

01:27:12.852 --> 01:27:17.356
But you stated
in your own handwriting,

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:22.319
"My horrible disrespect
for them."

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.821
Horrible...

01:27:24.822 --> 01:27:25.948
disrespect.

01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:28.951
That's hurtful,
is it not?

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:34.414
1037, is it not?

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:35.457
Yes, sir, it is.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:38.293
And what do you think
would happen

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:40.337
if everybody in this nation

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:43.590
disrespected
everyone else's person, huh?

01:27:44.467 --> 01:27:46.134
I don't know.
I really don't know.

01:27:46.135 --> 01:27:47.970
You sicken me.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:51.139
1037, you sicken me.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:52.432
And to be honest,

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:56.061
I wouldn't parole you
if you were the last man here.

01:27:56.062 --> 01:28:00.524
You are the least likely
candidate for parole

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:01.650
that we've seen.

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:03.235
Now, how do you feel
about that?

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.990
Well, I think that you're
entitled to your opinion.

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:10.075
Well, my opinion
means something

01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:11.702
in this particular place.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.372
I think we've heard enough.

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:16.832
You can take him away.

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:23.880
I have one more question
for you,

01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:26.591
1037.

01:28:26.592 --> 01:28:28.260
Since you've been here,

01:28:28.261 --> 01:28:29.886
you've been performing
your duties

01:28:29.887 --> 01:28:32.389
and accruing a certain salary?

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:35.892
Tell me,
would you forfeit your pay

01:28:35.893 --> 01:28:37.561
in exchange for parole?

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:40.939
Yes, ma'am, I would,
without a doubt.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:53.452
Do we let anyone go?

01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:56.830
Well, 1037 looks
ready to break.

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.081
Yeah,

01:28:58.082 --> 01:28:59.458
but is that a reason
to parole a man?

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:01.043
If we let somebody go,

01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:02.627
they're all gonna think
they can just talk their way

01:29:02.628 --> 01:29:04.046
out of here.

01:29:05.798 --> 01:29:07.674
Am I right, Jesse?

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:12.346
I was just trying to do it
exactly how I was treated.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.848
Completely...

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:17.642
reenact what they did...

01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:19.353
their feelings,
their attitudes,

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.563
their indifference.

01:29:23.608 --> 01:29:25.442
They...

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:37.454
What are...

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:38.538
Jesse, wait.

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:39.748
Hey, where you going?

01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:40.791
You know what?

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:42.209
It was an experiment,

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.585
and I went along with it,

01:29:43.586 --> 01:29:45.045
but I really hate myself
right now.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.547
You did nothing wrong.

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.549
That was just protocol.

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.218
Protocol?

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.011
Back in that room,
I became everything I've hated

01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:54.346
for so long,

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:56.640
and I let it happen.

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:59.393
And I enjoyed it.

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.520
You can't possibly understand
how it makes me feel.

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:02.979
Hey.

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:05.148
No.

01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:12.656
I need you to stay.

01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:18.620
Parole 1037 for me,
please.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:24.000
Sure.

01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:25.836
Thank you.

01:30:45.648 --> 01:30:46.690
Phil...

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:49.234
Oh, no, no.
Don't, don't.

01:31:13.926 --> 01:31:16.052
What is happening here,
Mike?

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:21.391
Is this thing over?

01:31:25.688 --> 01:31:28.648
We have become part
of this experiment,

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:31.359
whether we like it or not,

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.611
and frankly,
I don't even think

01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:35.489
that we can call this
an experiment anymore.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:39.910
It's a demonstration,
and...

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:41.995
part of me thinks
that we already

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:44.748
have the results
that we were looking for.

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:47.876
- Mike...
- No, I...

01:31:47.877 --> 01:31:49.252
I wanted to say that to you

01:31:49.253 --> 01:31:50.462
the last day or two,

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:53.423
but I was afraid
to question you.

01:31:53.424 --> 01:31:56.384
You know, I suppose that
if I didn't admire you so much,

01:31:56.385 --> 01:31:59.262
um... I...

01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:01.598
I don't know.

01:32:06.103 --> 01:32:07.562
And now?

01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:11.566
After seeing what this place
has done to us,

01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:14.486
to 1037,
to 8612,

01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:17.280
to Jesse,

01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:20.033
now I realize

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.994
that you have
to see this through.

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:33.421
I think, uh...

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.681
- This could be great.
- Yeah.

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:51.398
I had no idea
it would turn out this way.

01:32:53.526 --> 01:32:55.193
But...

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:00.031
This is important...

01:33:04.203 --> 01:33:05.870
To me.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:11.501
But the results
are important.

01:33:14.046 --> 01:33:15.672
They are.

01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:25.390
Parole him.

01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:54.628
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.671
How about we make this one
a night to remember?

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.009
You mean to tell me
that you spent all day long

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:03.136
in that stinking hole
because you wouldn't eat

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.305
two lousy, little sausages?

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.474
God damn, boy.

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:09.309
Well, maybe you want us
to take them sausages

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:10.769
and cram 'em
up your ass, huh?

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.854
Bet you like that,
416, won't you?

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.273
Just 'cause you
have no friends

01:34:15.274 --> 01:34:18.693
doesn't mean you have to make
everyone else suffer, 416.

01:34:20.696 --> 01:34:22.656
New guy,

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:24.157
look at me.

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:25.700
There you go.

01:34:25.701 --> 01:34:28.328
The hell is your problem,
boy, huh?

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.205
My problem is that
the guards

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:32.082
and the people
running this experiment

01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:34.876
are not treating the prisoners
like human beings.

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:39.673
The hell has that got to do
with sausages, huh?

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:42.593
The guards and the experimenters
are clearly in...

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.346
You address me

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:50.725
as Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:53.436
Mr. Correctional Officer,
the guard and the experimenters

01:34:53.437 --> 01:34:54.938
are clearly in violation
of the rules set up

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:56.314
for this experiment,

01:34:56.315 --> 01:34:59.359
and I refuse to endorse
an unfair system.

01:35:01.278 --> 01:35:03.279
What did you
expect, boy?

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.906
Huh?

01:35:04.907 --> 01:35:06.574
What the fuck
did you expect?

01:35:06.575 --> 01:35:09.536
Did you expect this to be
a fucking nursery school?

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.620
Huh?

01:35:10.621 --> 01:35:12.664
Is that what you thought
this was gonna be?

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:16.751
You thought you were gonna get
some playtime in the yard, boy?

01:35:16.752 --> 01:35:19.629
You thought you could
go around breaking the law

01:35:19.630 --> 01:35:22.048
and wind up in
a fucking nursery school?

01:35:23.634 --> 01:35:25.135
You listen to me, 416!

01:35:25.136 --> 01:35:28.096
You ain't going nowhere
but this fucking hole

01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:30.640
until you eat
those fucking sausages!

01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:33.059
Do you fucking
hear me, boy?

01:35:43.529 --> 01:35:45.363
Now, trust that
your fellow prisoner

01:35:45.364 --> 01:35:48.783
will not stick his wee-wee
in your asshole

01:35:48.784 --> 01:35:53.246
as you march to the restroom
to relieve yourselves.

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:55.206
Go on, now.

01:35:55.207 --> 01:35:57.751
March.
Right, left, right.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.335
You know how it's done.

01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:03.047
Come on, you miserable
sons of bitches.

01:36:03.048 --> 01:36:04.591
It's time
to shit and piss.

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:07.469
That means...
Go, go on.

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:16.394
It's incredible,
isn't it?

01:36:26.530 --> 01:36:28.239
Hey, hey.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.040
Wait just a...
Will you wait a second, please?

01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:32.786
What is it?

01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:34.996
What is wrong?

01:36:34.997 --> 01:36:36.039
What's wrong?

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.249
You're a psychologist,
for Christ sake,

01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:39.626
and you're asking me,
"What's wrong?"

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:41.044
You're missing
the bigger picture.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:43.755
This study has the potential
to help people.

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:45.381
Yes, felons, maybe,

01:36:45.382 --> 01:36:47.008
but those are kids,

01:36:47.009 --> 01:36:49.761
kids who have never committed
a crime in their lives.

01:36:49.762 --> 01:36:51.054
Kids who volunteered,

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:52.514
kids who are being
paid money,

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:53.723
kids who can leave
whenever they want to...

01:36:53.724 --> 01:36:55.183
They tried.

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:57.519
Every single one of them
came to your parole board

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.187
and all but begged,

01:36:59.188 --> 01:37:00.730
and I was sitting there,
going,

01:37:00.731 --> 01:37:02.273
"What's wrong
with these kids?

01:37:02.274 --> 01:37:03.775
"Why don't they just quit?

01:37:03.776 --> 01:37:05.318
"What are they
trying to prove?

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.237
What are they
so afraid of?"

01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:08.655
It's you.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:11.157
They are afraid of you.

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:15.119
That is absolute nonsense.

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.788
You're not looking at this
like a psychologist.

01:37:16.789 --> 01:37:18.206
No, I'm a human being,
Phil.

01:37:18.207 --> 01:37:19.791
I have empathy
for other human beings.

01:37:19.792 --> 01:37:21.292
Well, you're not gonna
cut it in this field

01:37:21.293 --> 01:37:24.462
if you're gonna get so emotional
over some basic procedure.

01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:31.261
Hey.
Hey, look.

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.390
You...

01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:36.850
of all people,

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:39.310
I thought would understand

01:37:39.311 --> 01:37:41.354
what I have tapped into
in my prison.

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.523
Your prison?

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:45.733
Oh, my God.

01:37:45.734 --> 01:37:48.236
You are so in
over your head.

01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:52.323
Those are not prisoners.

01:37:52.324 --> 01:37:53.950
Those are not subjects.

01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:55.493
They're not students.

01:37:55.494 --> 01:37:58.288
Those are boys, Phil.

01:37:58.289 --> 01:38:01.332
Those are boys,
and you are harming them.

01:38:01.333 --> 01:38:04.168
You need to fix this...

01:38:04.169 --> 01:38:05.962
now.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:09.173
Wow.

01:38:09.174 --> 01:38:10.800
Are you finished?

01:38:36.702 --> 01:38:39.287
Did I see you smile, 2093?

01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:42.040
I don't think so,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:43.666
What, you didn't think
it was funny?

01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:46.836
I think that it could be funny,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:38:46.837 --> 01:38:48.171
Then why didn't you smile?

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:49.547
Because I am not supposed
to smile during...

01:38:49.548 --> 01:38:50.882
That's right!

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:53.801
They're getting it now.

01:38:53.802 --> 01:38:55.720
5704, what the hell
are you doing

01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:57.121
with that chair
over your head, boy?

01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.474
I don't know,
Mr. Correctional Officer...

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:00.850
Well, if you don't know,
put it on down.

01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:02.477
You standing there,
wasting all your energy.

01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:03.978
You like it in there, 416?

01:39:03.979 --> 01:39:05.521
Not at all,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:06.898
Tough shit.

01:39:10.694 --> 01:39:12.278
7258,

01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:14.238
since you already have
your hands over your head,

01:39:14.239 --> 01:39:16.491
why don't you play Frankenstein?

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:23.498
2093 can play
the Bride of Frankenstein.

01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:26.793
7258,

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:28.378
stand here.

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.713
Walk over like Frankenstein

01:39:30.714 --> 01:39:33.675
and say that you love 2093.

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:42.392
That's not how
Frankenstein walks.

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:44.185
Have you seen Frankenstein,
7258?

01:39:44.186 --> 01:39:45.436
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:39:45.437 --> 01:39:48.022
So walk like fucking
Frankenstein.

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:54.362
Go on.

01:39:54.363 --> 01:39:56.114
I love you, 2093‒

01:39:56.115 --> 01:39:57.240
Get close.

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:03.329
Boy, you better get
a whole lot closer than that.

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:07.667
Get close.

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.002
Yeah, there you go.

01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:17.301
I love you, 2093.

01:40:17.302 --> 01:40:18.344
Mm-hmm.

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:20.471
Get the fuck back in line.

01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:22.265
Quit crying
like a little bitch.

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:27.395
Why are you such
an ass-licker, 2093, huh?

01:40:28.605 --> 01:40:30.565
I don't know,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:40:30.566 --> 01:40:32.442
You don't know.

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:35.194
Why is it that you try
to be obedient so much?

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:38.614
It's in my nature
to be obedient,

01:40:38.615 --> 01:40:39.657
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:40:39.658 --> 01:40:42.285
It's a fucking embarrassment
how obedient this guy is.

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:44.620
You little brownnose,
kiss-ass homeless boy,

01:40:44.621 --> 01:40:46.831
always doing
what you're told.

01:40:46.832 --> 01:40:48.583
What if I told you
to get down on the floor

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:50.043
and fuck the floor, huh?

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:51.252
What would you do then?

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:53.838
I would tell you
that I didn't know how,

01:40:53.839 --> 01:40:55.631
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:40:57.384 --> 01:40:59.177
Uh-huh.

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:03.431
Don't you go anywhere,
okay?

01:41:06.351 --> 01:41:08.352
Let's wake up our friend here.

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:17.070
Now, I want y'all to take
a really good look at this man,

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:20.907
because this man here

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:22.950
did not eat his sausages.

01:41:25.287 --> 01:41:27.038
Now, 2093,

01:41:27.039 --> 01:41:29.040
come on over here.

01:41:29.041 --> 01:41:31.042
Tell 416 you're gonna
kick his ass.

01:41:33.462 --> 01:41:35.254
I'm sorry, sir,
but I object.

01:41:43.806 --> 01:41:46.974
And just what
do you object to?

01:41:46.975 --> 01:41:49.894
I object to the word that you
used, Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:41:54.566 --> 01:41:56.734
The fuck word are you
talking about, boy?

01:41:56.735 --> 01:41:58.820
I'm sorry, sir.
I cannot say the word.

01:42:00.405 --> 01:42:02.573
Ass.

01:42:02.574 --> 01:42:05.326
He doesn't want to say "ass."

01:42:05.327 --> 01:42:06.994
Well, I gave you an order.

01:42:06.995 --> 01:42:09.288
Now you get over there
and tell him

01:42:09.289 --> 01:42:10.873
right now.

01:42:10.874 --> 01:42:12.458
I'm sorry, sir.

01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:14.669
I'm unable to do that.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:25.471
Well, well, well,
well, well.

01:42:26.515 --> 01:42:29.684
Our little Mr. Obediency
has a sore spot

01:42:29.685 --> 01:42:31.352
for bad little words.

01:42:31.353 --> 01:42:34.021
Just tell him that you'll
kick him in the end.

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.691
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:42:37.901 --> 01:42:39.277
Eat your sausages, 416,

01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:40.862
or I will kick you
in the end.

01:42:40.863 --> 01:42:43.281
There you go.
He said it.

01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:47.368
No, he said it,

01:42:47.369 --> 01:42:50.830
but did you mean it,
2093, huh?

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:52.039
Yes. No.

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.332
No, no, I'm sorry.

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:54.375
No, I did not.
I didn't mean it.

01:42:54.376 --> 01:42:55.585
So why are you lying?

01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:57.295
I said what Mr. Correctional
Officer told me to say, sir.

01:42:57.296 --> 01:42:58.337
That's bullshit.

01:42:58.338 --> 01:42:59.463
He didn't tell you to lie,
now, did he?

01:42:59.464 --> 01:43:02.717
Nobody wants any lying
in here, 2093.

01:43:02.718 --> 01:43:03.968
Okay?

01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:08.723
Why is it that all of y'all

01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:11.267
are a big load of liars,
huh?

01:43:12.728 --> 01:43:14.103
Huh?

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:18.024
- I don't know.
- Huh.

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.567
I guess we're just
a bunch of bastards,

01:43:19.568 --> 01:43:22.403
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:43:25.115 --> 01:43:27.825
Uh-huh.
I like that.

01:43:33.248 --> 01:43:34.957
Come on out here.

01:43:34.958 --> 01:43:39.086
So are you a bastard,
too, 2093?

01:43:39.087 --> 01:43:40.755
If you say so,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:43:40.756 --> 01:43:42.340
I say so...
I want to hear you say it.

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:43.758
I'm sorry, sir.

01:43:43.759 --> 01:43:45.259
I object
to the use of profanity,

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:46.677
and I will not say it.

01:43:46.678 --> 01:43:49.972
You said couldn't say that about
another human being, 2093?

01:43:49.973 --> 01:43:51.307
Can you say it to yourself?

01:43:51.308 --> 01:43:52.350
- Hmm?
- Uh?

01:43:52.351 --> 01:43:53.559
I wouldn't think of
saying it to myself

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.894
because then I would
be saying that I would...

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:56.229
That you'd be a bastard.

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:57.855
- Right?
- No, sir.

01:43:57.856 --> 01:43:59.857
- Yes, you would.
- Yes. Yes.

01:43:59.858 --> 01:44:00.900
What would you be?

01:44:00.901 --> 01:44:02.360
Would you be a bastard?

01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:04.237
You'd be saying nasty things
about your mother,

01:44:04.238 --> 01:44:05.571
that's what you'd be doing.

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:07.949
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:09.450
Why the hell won't you say it?

01:44:09.451 --> 01:44:12.370
Because I do not use
any profane language,

01:44:12.371 --> 01:44:13.496
Mr. Correctional Officer...

01:44:13.497 --> 01:44:15.206
Are you a fucking saint?

01:44:18.377 --> 01:44:20.836
It's real easy.
Just tell me what you are.

01:44:20.837 --> 01:44:24.173
I am whatever you wish me to be,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:44:24.174 --> 01:44:25.549
Oh!

01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:26.550
Well, you know what?

01:44:26.551 --> 01:44:29.262
If you won't say it...

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:30.680
If you won't say
that you're a bastard,

01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:32.306
you want to know
something, 2093?

01:44:32.307 --> 01:44:33.307
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:44:33.308 --> 01:44:35.017
You just proved my point.

01:44:35.018 --> 01:44:37.311
You a bastard.

01:44:37.312 --> 01:44:38.980
You a bastard either way.

01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:41.107
Isn't that right?

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.149
If you say so,
Mr. Correctional...

01:44:42.150 --> 01:44:43.442
I do say so!

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:45.903
I want to hear you say it,
god damn it!

01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:51.742
I'm sorry.

01:44:51.743 --> 01:44:53.327
I won't say it.

01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:57.832
Boys,

01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:59.792
I'm sure you want to get a real
good night's sleep tonight.

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.335
Am I right?

01:45:01.336 --> 01:45:03.129
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:05.840
Well, I think we're
gonna have to wait.

01:45:07.009 --> 01:45:11.262
Let 2093 think about just
what a bastard he really is,

01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:14.265
and then maybe he'll tell the
rest of us that he thinks so.

01:45:14.266 --> 01:45:15.933
May I have a cigarette,
please?

01:45:21.606 --> 01:45:25.192
At this rate, we gonna be here
all goddamn night.

01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:28.738
And I love it.

01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:41.167
I think you're
perfectly accurate

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:43.711
in your condemnation of me,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:45:47.424 --> 01:45:49.175
Oh, I know that.

01:45:50.635 --> 01:45:52.636
But I shouldn't say the word.

01:45:57.893 --> 01:45:59.894
Say what word?

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:10.112
I shall not say with any meaning
the word "bastard."

01:46:10.113 --> 01:46:12.490
Holy shit.

01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:16.619
He said it.

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:18.662
Well, glory be.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.665
I do believe he did.

01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:26.754
I think we got a winner.
Chicken dinner.

01:46:26.755 --> 01:46:29.215
We might even get
to bed early, boys.

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.758
Who knows?
Huh?

01:46:34.638 --> 01:46:37.556
Sweet relief.

01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:39.809
Now, uh...

01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:41.644
2093, just for swearing,

01:46:41.645 --> 01:46:44.188
why don't you get on the floor
and give me ten push-ups?

01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:45.648
Thank you,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:47.191
You're welcome, boy.

01:46:49.444 --> 01:46:51.612
One, two...

01:46:51.613 --> 01:46:53.781
- Three...
- Louder.

01:46:53.782 --> 01:46:55.282
Four, five...

01:46:55.283 --> 01:46:57.201
- Stop.
- Six.

01:46:57.202 --> 01:46:58.702
Those ain't no push-ups.

01:46:58.703 --> 01:47:00.788
Start over.

01:47:00.789 --> 01:47:03.874
One, two,
three...

01:47:03.875 --> 01:47:06.710
5704, you come over here.

01:47:06.711 --> 01:47:08.629
Six, seven...

01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:10.297
You can sit on his back.

01:47:10.298 --> 01:47:11.632
- Nine.
- Stop.

01:47:11.633 --> 01:47:12.800
Sit on his back.

01:47:12.801 --> 01:47:15.136
Keep going, 2093.

01:47:15.137 --> 01:47:17.638
- Go on, boy!
- One!

01:47:21.351 --> 01:47:22.393
You know what?

01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:26.897
4325, you come
over here too.

01:47:26.898 --> 01:47:28.149
That's it.
Sit on his back.

01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:29.817
There you go.

01:47:29.818 --> 01:47:31.902
Now do a push-up, 2093,

01:47:31.903 --> 01:47:33.446
and do not help him!

01:47:36.533 --> 01:47:39.410
One!

01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:48.961
Come on.

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.504
Get back
against the wall.

01:47:52.382 --> 01:47:54.383
Big, tough guy, huh?

01:47:54.384 --> 01:47:55.968
Can't even do one push-up.

01:48:00.182 --> 01:48:01.223
Yeah.

01:48:17.616 --> 01:48:19.283
Okay?

01:48:21.453 --> 01:48:24.413
Now, Mr. 2093 here

01:48:24.414 --> 01:48:27.500
says he ain't know
how to fuck.

01:48:28.543 --> 01:48:30.669
We gonna show you.

01:48:32.547 --> 01:48:34.423
Now, I want
my female camels...

01:48:34.424 --> 01:48:36.926
- Line up.
- To line up in the middle.

01:48:36.927 --> 01:48:39.803
Shoulder to shoulder,
right beside one another.

01:48:39.804 --> 01:48:41.263
- That's it. Right here.
- Like so.

01:48:41.264 --> 01:48:42.306
That's right.

01:48:42.307 --> 01:48:43.766
And I want my male camels

01:48:43.767 --> 01:48:45.893
to get behind
the female camels.

01:48:45.894 --> 01:48:48.687
- Bend down. Bend down.
- That's right. Come on, boys.

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:50.064
- Get down.
- What you doing, boy?

01:48:50.065 --> 01:48:51.357
Get on over here.

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:55.069
And y'all gonna do like the male
camels do to the female camels,

01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:56.570
and y'all gonna hump them.

01:48:56.571 --> 01:48:58.113
2093, pay attention.

01:48:58.114 --> 01:49:00.241
You could afford to learn
a thing or two.

01:49:00.242 --> 01:49:01.450
- Come on.
- Now have at it, boys.

01:49:01.451 --> 01:49:03.202
Went too deep. Come on.

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:04.912
Got a lot of work to do now.

01:49:04.913 --> 01:49:06.830
Get inside her.
She's waiting for you.

01:49:06.831 --> 01:49:08.207
There.

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.793
- Keep humping.
- Come on, that's it.

01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:13.420
Yeah, that's right.

01:49:13.421 --> 01:49:15.548
Nice and gentle
with that camel, yeah.

01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:17.174
Good, keep her
in that low back end.

01:49:17.175 --> 01:49:18.384
That's it.

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:21.595
Open up that way.
Keep humping.

01:49:21.596 --> 01:49:23.556
It's okay.
This one's gonna shed a few‒

01:49:23.557 --> 01:49:25.558
You know, uh, why don't you, uh,

01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:27.726
serenade your fellow inmates
to keep them in the mood?

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.812
That's good. Come on.

01:49:29.813 --> 01:49:32.773
What would you like me to sing,
Mr. Correctional Officer?

Now I want all y'all to come up
to 416 and thank him.

01:50:26.745 --> 01:50:29.663
Thank you, 416, for singing
such a pretty song to us.

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:32.583
Thank you, 416.

01:50:32.584 --> 01:50:34.585
Oh, I think
you can do better than that.

01:50:34.586 --> 01:50:37.004
- Thank you, 416!
- There you go.

01:50:37.005 --> 01:50:38.172
Thank you, 416.

01:50:38.173 --> 01:50:40.090
Oh, I think you can
say it louder than that.

01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:41.425
Thank you, 416!

01:50:41.426 --> 01:50:43.594
Yeah, say it
like you mean it now.

01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:44.720
Thank you, 416.

01:50:44.721 --> 01:50:47.264
From the bottom
of your heart now.

01:50:47.265 --> 01:50:50.059
- Thank you, 416.
- Oh, yeah.

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:52.478
Thank you, 416!

01:50:54.105 --> 01:50:55.356
Thank you, 416.

01:51:01.112 --> 01:51:02.655
Thank you, 416.

01:51:03.782 --> 01:51:05.240
Thank you, 416.

01:51:05.241 --> 01:51:08.035
- Hey.
- Thank you, 416.

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:10.371
Thank you, 416.

01:51:10.372 --> 01:51:11.413
Hey.

01:51:12.457 --> 01:51:13.499
Thank you, 416.

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.541
Hey!

01:51:22.175 --> 01:51:25.219
This experiment is...

01:51:27.097 --> 01:51:29.390
Over.

01:51:36.272 --> 01:51:37.940
Did you hear what I said?

01:51:42.153 --> 01:51:43.862
This exper...

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:46.990
This experiment
is terminated

01:51:46.991 --> 01:51:49.159
from this point on.

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:54.540
You...

01:51:57.919 --> 01:52:02.297
The Stanford County Jail
is now closed.

01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:07.803
You're all free to leave.

01:52:22.944 --> 01:52:25.112
So does this mean
we're not getting paid

01:52:25.113 --> 01:52:27.156
for the full two weeks?

01:52:51.347 --> 01:52:53.390
I said to myself at
the beginning of the first day,

01:52:53.391 --> 01:52:57.060
"This could be a very long,
very boring experiment."

01:52:57.061 --> 01:53:00.022
Uh, it wasn't conceivable.

01:53:01.775 --> 01:53:04.359
There was just no strong sense
of precedent

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:06.653
for how far this thing could go.

01:53:36.226 --> 01:53:37.601
It's easy for you to say,

01:53:37.602 --> 01:53:39.937
"Oh, I wouldn't have
acted that way."

01:53:39.938 --> 01:53:41.939
But you don't know.

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.233
That's... that's the truth.
You don't know.

01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:46.610
And now,
I know what I'm capable of,

01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:48.278
and it hurts.

01:53:48.279 --> 01:53:50.656
That...

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:52.199
I don't know... I don't know
how else to say it,

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:55.285
but it does hurt me
to know that.

01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:05.045
You know, and I knew right away
it was wrong,

01:54:05.046 --> 01:54:06.588
and I was the only one
that could see it.

01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:08.799
You know, anyone could see it
except for these guys.

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:09.883
You know, you give them
the uniform

01:54:09.884 --> 01:54:11.051
with the glasses
and the nightstick,

01:54:11.052 --> 01:54:12.636
and they simply
can't be the same person

01:54:12.637 --> 01:54:14.972
as if they wore street clothes.

01:54:14.973 --> 01:54:16.932
Meanwhile, I'm just
a number in a dress.

01:54:16.933 --> 01:54:19.226
That's the thing; I wasn't
a prisoner in an experiment.

01:54:19.227 --> 01:54:21.687
I was their prisoner.

01:54:21.688 --> 01:54:25.983
I really felt that
I was losing my identity,

01:54:25.984 --> 01:54:30.863
that this person
that I call Tom

01:54:30.864 --> 01:54:34.575
was disappearing.

01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:39.913
And it was a prison to me.

01:54:39.914 --> 01:54:43.041
It still is a prison to me.

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:46.169
You know, I don't look at it
as an experiment

01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:47.921
or a simulation at all.

01:54:47.922 --> 01:54:50.299
It was a prison
that was run by psychologists

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.926
instead of by the state.

01:54:52.927 --> 01:54:55.387
The consensus
is that they did suffer.

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:02.060
But...

01:55:03.104 --> 01:55:05.939
I think that

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:08.525
they also learned a great deal
about themselves

01:55:08.526 --> 01:55:10.611
and about human nature.

01:55:10.612 --> 01:55:13.614
And I think most of them
would say

01:55:13.615 --> 01:55:17.200
that in hindsight it was
a very valuable experience.

01:55:43.353 --> 01:55:45.854
This whole experience harms me,

01:55:45.855 --> 01:55:48.607
and I mean "harms"
in the present tense.

01:55:48.608 --> 01:55:50.484
- It harms me.
- How did it harm you?

01:55:50.485 --> 01:55:51.944
Or how does it
harm you?

01:55:51.945 --> 01:55:53.779
Is it just to think that
people can be like that?

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:54.947
Yeah.

01:55:54.948 --> 01:55:56.990
And I know
you're a nice guy.

01:55:56.991 --> 01:55:58.533
You know?

01:55:59.494 --> 01:56:00.535
Well, you don't know that.

01:56:00.536 --> 01:56:01.703
No, I do.

01:56:01.704 --> 01:56:02.788
I do know that
you're a nice guy.

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:03.997
Then why do you hate me?

01:56:03.998 --> 01:56:05.832
Because I know what
you can turn into.

01:56:07.168 --> 01:56:10.128
If you were in my position,
what would you have done?

01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:12.005
I don't know.

01:56:12.006 --> 01:56:13.674
I don't know.
I can't tell you that.

01:56:13.675 --> 01:56:17.010
- I wasn't.
- Hmm.

01:56:17.011 --> 01:56:19.721
I don't think I would
have been as, uh...

01:56:19.722 --> 01:56:21.848
I don't believe
I would have been

01:56:21.849 --> 01:56:24.851
as inventive as you.

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:28.605
I don't think I would have
applied as much imagination

01:56:28.606 --> 01:56:29.606
to what I was doing.

01:56:29.607 --> 01:56:32.109
You understand?

01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:33.610
Yes.
I understand.

01:56:33.611 --> 01:56:35.404
I would have been a guard.

01:56:35.405 --> 01:56:37.864
I don't think it would have
been such a masterpiece.

01:56:41.703 --> 01:56:45.038
Personally, I-I don't see
where it was really harmful.

01:56:45.039 --> 01:56:46.540
It was degrading,

01:56:46.541 --> 01:56:49.042
but that was part of
my particular

01:56:49.043 --> 01:56:50.419
little experiment that...

01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:52.838
Oh, your particular
little experiments?

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:54.047
- Well, why...
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:56:54.048 --> 01:56:56.008
Why don't you tell us
about those?

01:56:56.009 --> 01:56:58.510
Yes, I was running
experiments of my own.

01:56:58.511 --> 01:57:00.804
Well, tell me about
these little experiments.

01:57:00.805 --> 01:57:02.222
- I'm curious.
- Okay.

01:57:02.223 --> 01:57:05.017
I wanted to see just
what kind of verbal abuse

01:57:05.018 --> 01:57:07.352
people can take before
they start objecting,

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:09.229
before they start
lashing back.

01:57:09.230 --> 01:57:10.981
And it really surprised...

01:57:10.982 --> 01:57:13.567
It really surprised me that
nobody said anything to stop me.

01:57:13.568 --> 01:57:15.152
Nobody said,
"Come on, man. You...

01:57:15.153 --> 01:57:16.486
"You can't say
those things to me.

01:57:16.487 --> 01:57:18.405
Those things are sick."
Nobody said that.

01:57:18.406 --> 01:57:20.657
And nobody questioned
my authority at all.

01:57:20.658 --> 01:57:22.159
And it really shocked me.

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.161
I-I started to get...

01:57:25.038 --> 01:57:26.830
I started to abuse
people so much.

01:57:26.831 --> 01:57:28.957
I started to get so profane.

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:32.711
And still, people
didn't say anything.
